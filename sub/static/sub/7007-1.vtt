00:01.401 --> 00:05.167
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!</i>

00:05.238 --> 00:06.762
Welcome to a brand new season.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.537
Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:17.283 --> 00:18.841
Thank you.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.112
Thank you.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.355
Thank you, Heidi.
Welcome to a new season.

00:23.423 --> 00:27.860
I think, therefore I am,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.157
You all know my assistant.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.699
He eats, therefore he is, Al Borland.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.770
We have a sizzling hot show
for you today.

00:41.841 --> 00:43.399
So, let's get cooking.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.740
<i>It's barbeque week here on Tool Time.</i>

00:47.347 --> 00:49.872
Barbequing goes back to primitive times

00:49.949 --> 00:53.908
<i>when cavemen rubbed two sticks together
to cook their carcass du jour.</i>

00:56.756 --> 00:59.919
Nothing like an all-you-can-eat
brontosaurus buffet.

01:00.693 --> 01:03.423
But stay clear of that pudding. Plonko!

01:05.165 --> 01:09.067
Nowadays, you can cook your meat
on this three dollar portable unit,

01:09.135 --> 01:10.659
or cook like a king

01:10.737 --> 01:14.002
with this $35,000 gas cooking unit.

01:14.607 --> 01:18.475
Built-in dishwasher,
disposal, CD player.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.410
And, in a pinch,

01:20.480 --> 01:22.607
an automatic hibachi cook.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.787
For purists
there's nothing like charcoal.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.826
They think the true measure of a man
is how fast he can light his coals.

01:34.894 --> 01:38.455
Yeah. And a woman thinks it's how long
a man can keep his coals lit.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.101
There's a gentleman in Indiana
who used liquid oxygen.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.399
He got his charcoal ready
in three seconds.

01:45.472 --> 01:49.135
There's a handsome guy here in Detroit
who says he can beat that record.

01:56.649 --> 02:00.380
You may be wondering how Tim's going
to beat that three second record.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.183
I'm not wondering.
I got hold of my buddies at NASA.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.814
They gave me their secret.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.585
Rocket fuel!

02:08.761 --> 02:12.925
Rocket fuel's made with LOX,
but this don't go on no bagel, baby.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.926
This is liquid oxygen
with a skosche of hydrogen,

02:18.004 --> 02:21.303
and for fun,
a little soupÃ§on of cilantro for flavor.

02:21.374 --> 02:24.673
We're trained professionals.
Please do not try this at home.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.439
Ah, there you go.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.073
Heidi, my fire-starting device, please.

02:29.182 --> 02:32.345
- There you go, Tim.
- Very high-tech. It's a stick.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.921
Two-point-six seconds.
A new world record!

02:41.227 --> 02:44.458
- Tim, it's a little out of control.
- Don't worry about it.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.295
- Don't panic.
- Stay away from the barbeque!

02:48.868 --> 02:51.200
It's OK, all right?
It's fine. It's done.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:55.902 --> 03:59.394
<i>Don't worry about it.
Don't worry. Don't panic.</i>

04:02.275 --> 04:04.209
OK. I'm all packed.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.501
<i>How was the Tool Time?</i>

04:06.579 --> 04:09.514
Amazing.
Dad just launched a barbeque into space.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.114
Dad has been acting weird lately.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.379
Even for him.

04:14.454 --> 04:18.015
You're telling me. He woke me up
in the middle of the night last night

04:18.124 --> 04:21.024
<i>to talk about existentialism,
vis-a-vis Tool Time.</i>

04:23.029 --> 04:26.260
<i>- Dad actually used the term vis-a-vis?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

04:26.332 --> 04:29.961
Then he had this great revelation
coming out of the bathroom.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.437
"If a man flushes the toilet
and no one's around to notice it,

04:34.507 --> 04:36.475
did it really flush?"

04:38.578 --> 04:40.409
Boy, does he need this vacation.

04:41.214 --> 04:44.513
I wish we were going tonight.
Lauren and her family are there.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.745
- Did you talk to her?
- Yeah.

04:46.853 --> 04:49.549
She says the weather's perfect,
the water's nice.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.453
<i>The only thing missing is moi.</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:54.055
That's French for "me".

04:55.795 --> 04:57.422
What's French for "barf"?

04:59.999 --> 05:02.763
Mark, did you remember to pack
your bathing suit?

05:02.869 --> 05:04.234
Let me check.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.337
What is the deal with you wearing
nothing but black clothes lately?

05:11.411 --> 05:12.639
I like black.

05:12.712 --> 05:16.239
He's trying to create an image
for himself: bleak and desperate.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.878
It's working.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.813
Boys, go upstairs
and get your suitcases.

05:21.921 --> 05:25.186
I want to pack the car tonight so
we don't have to do it in the morning.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.226
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.926
What a great day, huh?

05:29.996 --> 05:32.055
I did some soul-searching.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.024
I got a brand-new power soaker.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.804
And my barbeque grill was spotted
over Roswell, New Mexico.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.741
Life is good.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.076
Life sucks.

05:50.316 --> 05:53.046
- What's wrong?
- Angela broke up with me.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.417
- I thought she was crazy about you.
- She was.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.457
Now she's crazy about some guy
with a brand-new Firebird.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.253
Oh, Brad.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.486
With a V-8?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.956
Mom, I can't go on this trip.
I'm too bummed out.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.934
Come on, son. It'll do you no good
to sit around here and mope.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.469
Well, your dad's right.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.266
Come up to the lake and mope.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.173
You'll have no time to mope.
None of you will.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.938
I have a big surprise for you
when we get up there.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.071
Guess what it is.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.675
Seeing Angela up there is the only
surprise that'll make me happy.

06:25.752 --> 06:29.779
OK, hint number one.
This surprise won't make Brad happy.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.185
Guess what
the surprise is, anybody.

06:37.263 --> 06:40.892
Once we get there you'll start
acting like a sane person?

06:40.967 --> 06:42.662
Way off. Guess again.

06:44.771 --> 06:47.399
We've spent
the last four hours guessing.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.601
You're still not even close.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.509
- All right.
- Oh!

06:56.416 --> 07:00.079
Now, Tim, just think about this
for a second.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.450
If we guess the surprise

07:01.521 --> 07:04.581
we will be depriving you
of the thrill of surprising us.

07:04.657 --> 07:09.219
You'll be depriving us of the joy
of experiencing your surprise.

07:09.896 --> 07:14.230
<i>Profound, but not profound enough,
vis-a-vis the quid pro quo.</i>

07:14.300 --> 07:16.325
<i>"Quid pro quo?"</i>

07:21.808 --> 07:24.368
Look, it's beautiful.
It's exactly the same.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.537
Not exactly. They fixed the plumbing.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.480
Now, when you turn on the faucet,
it doesn't sound like mating whales.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.381
I'm going over to see Lauren.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.387
No. I want you all unpacked
before anyone goes anywhere.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.923
And no one's gonna fight
over the good bed.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.519
What does it matter? I'm gonna cry
into my pillow no matter where I sleep.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.331
That's the spirit.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.903
I get the bed!

07:51.971 --> 07:55.463
- No, I'm not sleeping on this.
- Boys! Boys!

07:56.142 --> 07:58.576
Just put the spring
back in the mattress.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.339
Put some duct tape over it, all right?

08:02.148 --> 08:05.879
Any more lip, you'll just
have to wait longer for that surprise.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.415
Hey, are you relaxed?
Boy, am I relaxed!

08:13.759 --> 08:16.523
No, I'm a wreck.
My oldest son is heartbroken.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.292
And my youngest son
is dressing like Johnny Cash.

08:19.365 --> 08:22.300
They're teenagers,
doing the same stuff we used to do.

08:22.368 --> 08:25.303
No, it is much harder
to be a teenager nowadays.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.397
It's more competitive,
peer pressure's more intense.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.942
Jill! Jill! We're on vacation.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.573
More importantly, I'm on vacation.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.748
Hello?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.818
- Oh, hi, Lauren.
- Is Randy around?

08:41.453 --> 08:44.183
Randy? Oh, for the love of Mike!

08:45.458 --> 08:47.892
I knew we forgot something!

08:50.396 --> 08:52.455
- Hey, I missed you.
- Hi.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.056
I missed you, too.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.795
I came by boat with my friend
and my little sister.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.700
- Do you want to go for a ride?
- Sure.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.898
Whoa. Friend?

09:01.507 --> 09:02.633
Sister?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.938
You know we have extra boys around here.

09:06.212 --> 09:10.080
I don't think Brad and Mark
are gonna be in the mood for that.

09:10.149 --> 09:13.516
Brad, Mark, there's girls
down at the lake that want to meet you.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.817
- All right. Hey, Lauren.
- Bye, Brad.

09:23.496 --> 09:27.364
- I love being with you on the lake.
- I love being with you anywhere.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.237
You're really different
from your brothers.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.535
- You're so...
- Dark?

09:36.342 --> 09:37.604
Yeah.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.008
I like dark.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.308
How do you feel about "dork"?

09:42.815 --> 09:45.079
Jenny, I'm not just interested in looks.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.085
A girl's gotta have a personality.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.654
That's why Angela was so perfect.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.384
That's nice to hear.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.457
Again.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.720
I'm sorry.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.524
I'll stop talking about her.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.122
I don't know what's so great
about Angela, anyway.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.292
As I recall, she was a blonde goddess

10:02.368 --> 10:05.599
who cleaned your room
and worshiped the ground you walked on.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.536
You're right. She was awesome.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.640
This is so much fun!

10:17.717 --> 10:19.582
So I'm told.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.651
- Are you tired of driving yet?
- Nope.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.849
- Are you gonna let me drive?
- No.

10:24.924 --> 10:28.382
Do you want me to drop my pants
and moon Rev. Hicks in cabin four?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.826
Yep.

10:32.565 --> 10:33.998
This is so peaceful.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.828
Yeah. I just can't wait
until we get to be alone.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.268
Alone.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.933
I guess when it comes down to it,
all of us are alone.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.446
Will you shut up?

10:49.181 --> 10:50.842
- Slow down!
- What?

10:50.916 --> 10:52.247
Slow down!

10:53.486 --> 10:55.249
Look out!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.718
That wasrt the surprise!

11:08.601 --> 11:11.069
Wow. That's a big piece of meat.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.007
Good thing they re-did the plumbing.

11:16.742 --> 11:19.210
How come your girls
didn't join us for dinner?

11:19.278 --> 11:22.907
Oh, probably 'cause they're still
picking kelp out of their ears.

11:22.982 --> 11:26.611
Jenny hated me. You think
I talked about Angela too much?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.553
Brad, you did 20 minutes
on how nice her teeth were.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.591
I loved to watch her chew.

11:32.658 --> 11:34.751
- Will you shut up?
- Guys, come on.

11:34.827 --> 11:37.318
Let's not fight.
We're in a place we all love.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.330
It's almost time for that surprise.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.526
Thank God. I'm so sick of the surprise.
I don't care what it is.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.535
I don't care what it cost.
I want it over.

11:44.603 --> 11:47.163
It will be.
All I gotta do is light these coals.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.604
No!

11:54.680 --> 11:57.513
No peeking. Follow me.
Watch your step.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.051
We're almost there.
Watch yourselves.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.643
OK. Uncover your eyes.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.384
This is the big surprise?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.429
- This is the old lodge.
- They haven't used it in 10 years.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.225
You can tell.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.823
There's broken windows,
cobwebs everywhere.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.800
A moose with one antler.

12:17.803 --> 12:21.330
I know it doesn't look like much,
but it will after we fix it up.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.533
We?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.570
We're gonna buy this place.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.202
We're gonna what?

12:27.279 --> 12:31.648
We're gonna buy this, sell our house,
say good-bye to Detroit, move up here.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.419
Surprise!

12:40.993 --> 12:44.156
- We're really gonna move up here?
- Yeah.

12:44.230 --> 12:46.095
Re-do the lodge, fix up the cabins.

12:46.165 --> 12:49.464
Next year we'll be living here.
It'll be a whole new start for us.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.902
I'm 15 years old.
I haven't even finished up my old start.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.371
Tim, you can't be serious.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.070
Why not?

12:59.145 --> 13:02.376
Everyone in this family has told me
they want to live up here.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.915
Yeah, when we're 80.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.782
Eighty's just around the corner,
little man.

13:10.589 --> 13:14.548
What's the difference where we live?
I carry my emotional baggage with me.

13:17.663 --> 13:20.359
Boys, um, will you leave us alone
for a minute?

13:20.432 --> 13:22.400
I need to talk to your dad.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.096
Talk may not do the trick.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.137
Go with electroshock.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.367
I know you're thinking
this is gonna be rough on the boys.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.810
- You and I can get them over the hump.
- Honey.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.677
Did it ever occur to you

13:36.782 --> 13:40.013
that we have this little thing
back in Detroit called a life?

13:40.085 --> 13:42.019
That's moving too fast, you said it.

13:42.087 --> 13:44.988
The boys are too competitive.
Too much peer pressure.

13:45.057 --> 13:47.992
I don't want to leave it.
What about my psychology degree?

13:48.060 --> 13:51.359
- I'll get my Masters this year.
- So we don't move till next year.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.193
I've done all the legwork, honey.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.825
There's plenty of nutcases up here
you can shrink.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.899
Louie at the bait shop. Flonko.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.234
<i>What about Tool Time?</i>

14:06.545 --> 14:09.878
It's time for a change.
It'll be the best year ever.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.213
Then I'll just
hand my tool belt down to Al.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.650
I'll have to add a few more notches.

14:16.021 --> 14:20.287
Listen, this whole plan is just insane.

14:20.359 --> 14:24.819
I don't want to be uprooted from my home
and everything we've worked so hard for.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.866
- You don't like this idea?
- I hate this idea!

14:27.967 --> 14:29.992
Oh, come on, Tim.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.937
You didn't consult any of us.
You didn't consider our feelings.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.871
That's the surprise!

14:39.011 --> 14:41.775
The surprise will be the day you do.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.749
I was just trying to do something for
my family, and you don't appreciate it.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.685
Any normal person would see why I don't!

14:48.754 --> 14:51.120
- Well, maybe I'm not normal.
- Maybe!

14:54.426 --> 14:56.326
I'm going for a walk.

15:05.304 --> 15:07.272
Whoa. What a beautiful sand castle.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.669
Why, thank you,
my beachcombing neighborette.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.713
Wilson! What are you doing here?

15:15.381 --> 15:18.612
I got a call last night
that cabin number four had opened up.

15:18.684 --> 15:21.448
Apparently, Reverend Hicks
checked out in a huff.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.647
Something about a full moon.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.018
Tim.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.489
So, where is your splendiferous spouse?

15:31.563 --> 15:34.726
I don't know where he is.
Lately, I don't know who he is.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.262
Yesterday when we got up here,

15:37.336 --> 15:40.203
he announced that
he wants us all to move here.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.832
Now that you mention it,
he has been acting odd.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.673
He told me he was considering
becoming a part-time physicist.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.474
- Tim?
- Mm-hmm.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.641
Said he wants to contemplate
the origins of the universe.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.550
Tuesdays, Thursdays
and every other Friday.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.180
What is the deal with him?
He's all over the place lately.

15:58.257 --> 16:01.488
Yeah. Tim reminds me
of the poet, Lord Byron.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.289
- Byron?
- Mm-hmm.

16:03.362 --> 16:07.389
Nah. The only poem Tim knows
starts with, "Hickory, dickory dock".

16:08.834 --> 16:12.565
No, Jill, see, Byron noted
that men of Tim's life experience

16:12.638 --> 16:16.904
suddenly go through difficult times
and they respond in strange ways.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.407
Byron said,
"Of all the barbarous middle ages,

16:20.512 --> 16:24.539
that which is most barbarous
is the middle age of man".

16:25.918 --> 16:29.217
So, you're saying
that Tim's having a mid-life crisis?

16:29.288 --> 16:30.585
I'm not sure about that.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.888
I do know he is at an age where he has
to come to grips with his own mortality.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.729
I don't know. It's not like
Tim's wearing gold chains

16:39.798 --> 16:41.663
and has a blonde on each arm.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.962
Yet.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.297
Well, the truth is that every man
struggles with middle age

16:47.373 --> 16:49.136
in his own unique way.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.979
Whoo-hoo!

16:56.048 --> 16:59.347
This thing is great!

17:04.656 --> 17:06.521
- That was nice.
- Yeah, it was.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.891
- I'm a little choked up myself.
- Me, too.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.198
- Hi.
- Whoa.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.828
- Cool castle.
- Yeah.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.701
Well, I'm just killing time.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.867
I've been waiting for your father
to come out of the water.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.308
Yep.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.642
We always wait for the ones we love.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.608
Brad, you're still young.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.448
You'll meet other girls.

17:35.554 --> 17:39.320
I know, but how will any of these
other girls measure up to Angela?

17:41.427 --> 17:45.693
Honey, I know this sounds trite,
but it does happen to everybody.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.226
You're gonna find your true love,
just like I did.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.269
I'm back and I've got crabs.

17:54.606 --> 17:57.370
If that's true love,
I'm better off alone.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.139
They're actually crawdads.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.773
- I don't care. Get them away from me.
- Oh. I messed up again?

18:04.716 --> 18:07.446
Tim, wait, hold on.
I want to say something to you.

18:07.519 --> 18:10.215
OK, go ahead.
Give it to me.

18:10.289 --> 18:13.053
Uh... you know your whole dream
about moving up here?

18:13.158 --> 18:15.592
I shouldn't have dismissed it
out of hand.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.454
So, you don't think
it's such a bad idea?

18:19.531 --> 18:23.297
Yeah, I do. But you don't,
and I should respect that.

18:24.103 --> 18:28.267
You obviously want to make
some pretty big changes in your life.

18:29.908 --> 18:32.877
I feel like wiping the slate clean
and starting over.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.348
Does this have anything to do with us?

18:37.416 --> 18:39.475
Oh, come on. No, not at all.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.152
I just need new challenges.

18:42.221 --> 18:46.123
Nothing wrong with challenges.
You have to trash what's working?

18:46.191 --> 18:50.252
I just know that there's
a lot of things I want to do.

18:50.329 --> 18:53.298
If I don't start doing them now
I'll never get them done.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.168
Tim, sometimes
when a guy gets to be your age,

18:58.203 --> 19:01.263
he goes through this, um...

19:01.340 --> 19:02.500
...mid-life crisis.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.168
Stop.
I'm not going through a mid-life crisis.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.611
If I was, I'd be driving a Porsche
with a blonde named Chrissie.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.478
Which doesn't sound
like a half-bad idea.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.778
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:12.851 --> 19:15.411
You don't have to date Chrissie
to go through this.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.580
- There are other symptoms.
- Like what?

19:17.656 --> 19:20.625
<i>Like wanting to give up Tool Time
to become a physicist.</i>

19:20.692 --> 19:22.353
That's only part-time.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.160
Wh...

19:26.532 --> 19:28.500
You see how the boys are growing.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.699
You've got a new job.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.798
I'm just left in the dust,

19:33.872 --> 19:36.238
<i>using foreign phrases ad nauseum.</i>

19:37.609 --> 19:41.545
You feel like everyone else is moving
forward and you're standing still?

19:42.614 --> 19:44.047
Maybe.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.415
Like life is just meaningless,
without hope...

19:47.486 --> 19:50.182
- A shell of the man you once were.
- I'm not a shell.

19:50.255 --> 19:53.315
- Full of desperation, pain.
- I'm not full of desperation!

19:53.392 --> 19:54.950
I get the point.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.052
- It's not quite that bad.
- OK.

19:57.129 --> 20:01.088
I'm going through a tough time and
I'll figure out a way to deal with this.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.726
Can you deal with this
without buying a lodge?

20:03.802 --> 20:06.635
I'll try, but I want
to leave that option open.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.704
OK.

20:09.775 --> 20:13.677
And you know, it's not like you're gonna
have to go through it alone.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.338
- I'll be with you.
- Yeah?

20:16.448 --> 20:17.574
Yeah.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.183
I want you around when I start
going through those hot flashes.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.586
Oh.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.018
- I hope you'll be sensitive.
- I'll try.

20:28.093 --> 20:31.529
I'll try not to burst out laughing
when you wake up with a goatee.

20:33.098 --> 20:34.827
I appreciate that.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.458
I love you.

20:36.535 --> 20:39.095
- Oh.
- What?

20:39.171 --> 20:40.866
Did you shave this morning?

20:47.579 --> 20:49.638
It is so beautiful here.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.450
It would be nice to live here someday.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.783
Lou at the bait shop's counting on you.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.482
Did you really go around
looking for crazy people?

20:58.557 --> 21:00.650
I don't have to. They find me.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.219
Well, we should go back
and start dinner.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.128
OK.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.530
Oh.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.101
Ooh. Something smells so good.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.434
Somebody's barbequing.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.079
Does ever...

21:39.831 --> 21:42.356
Let's hold.

21:42.434 --> 21:43.867
More.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.063
Boys! Boys!

21:49.074 --> 21:51.702
Just shove, uh,
that spring back in the mattress,

21:51.777 --> 21:54.143
put some duct tape over it.
