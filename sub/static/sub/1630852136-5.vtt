WEBVTT

00:12.360 --> 00:14.623
The person who
called 911, Thomas Morris,

00:14.710 --> 00:17.104
he's dead, so is Joe Kercy.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.673
This investigation now falls
under Operation Noble Eagle.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.546
I'm forwarding you Bruce's
email, so you be careful.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.156
When Bruce gets
into these moods,

00:26.243 --> 00:28.289
he sees everyone
around him as a threat.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.639
So tell me more
about your lone wolf theory.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.945
All signs
point to our perp being a

00:33.033 --> 00:36.732
highly-educated
American citizen with
scientific expertise.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.604
Bruce can snap.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.433
You don't know what
Bruce is capable of.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.826
So what should
I do with the report?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.393
Just file it.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.482
The results
came back, it's Ames.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.658
Ames strain?

00:49.745 --> 00:50.702
I didn't think it existed
outside of high security
research labs.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.704
It doesn't.

00:52.791 --> 00:53.879
<i>RUMSFELD : This </i>
administration is not afraid

00:53.966 --> 00:55.751
<i>of saying the word Iraq.</i>

00:55.838 --> 00:57.753
<i>Iraq has been on the </i>
terrorist list for years.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.712
That's USAMRIID, one
of only 16 labs in the US that

01:00.799 --> 01:03.628
has the Ames strain which
means the anthrax came from

01:03.715 --> 01:06.588
the most respected
biodefense lab in the country.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.524
Sometimes I go places.

02:16.962 --> 02:19.095
Bad neighborhoods
in Baltimore,

02:19.182 --> 02:21.619
hoping somebody
will pick a fight.

02:23.099 --> 02:24.405
No one's cleaning
up the streets.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.103
There's no justice out there.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.800
Justice?

02:31.194 --> 02:34.110
Are you saying that you
carry a loaded weapon?

02:34.197 --> 02:35.720
Bruce, in those moments
are you considering

02:35.807 --> 02:37.635
doing bodily harm to someone?

02:37.722 --> 02:40.072
People harm people
for bad reasons all the time.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.728
If I wanted to do real damage,

02:43.815 --> 02:45.556
every day I work
with deadly diseases

02:45.643 --> 02:46.818
no one's never even heard of,

02:46.905 --> 02:48.820
USAMRIID's full of them.

02:48.907 --> 02:53.608
One vial from my lab, I could
contaminate the water supply,

02:53.695 --> 02:55.914
wipe out a whole city.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.137
Obviously I'm not that person.

03:01.224 --> 03:05.010
I wanna help people and save
lives like my anthrax vaccine.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.925
Why don't they see that?

03:07.012 --> 03:08.927
Who?

03:09.014 --> 03:12.757
The FBI, they subpoenaed
anthrax samples from us.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.282
Keep poking on our labs
like we're the suspects, us,

03:15.369 --> 03:20.461
the good guys, when
there's terrorists out there.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.245
<i>REPORTER : </i>
I'll tell you, Lisa,

03:22.332 --> 03:24.204
<i>senators here on </i>
Capitol Hill are frustrated

03:24.291 --> 03:28.295
<i>by the FBI's sleepy response </i>
to the anthrax attacks.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.645
<i>Five Americans have </i>
lost their lives and

03:30.732 --> 03:33.430
<i>yet no terrorists </i>
are in custody.

03:33.517 --> 03:36.999
I'll make sure we get
a call on the Southwest today.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.914
What's going on?

03:39.001 --> 03:41.308
Copak's adding two more
teams to the investigation.

03:41.395 --> 03:44.267
Miller and Reilly,

03:44.354 --> 03:47.227
you'll join
Sykes' team as well.

03:49.272 --> 03:52.841
Senate just voted to
send our troops into Iraq,

03:52.928 --> 03:56.671
people's husbands,
sons, wives, daughters

03:56.758 --> 03:59.891
will be risking their
lives to fight terrorists.

03:59.978 --> 04:04.026
We owe it to them to find the
terrorists here on our soil.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.246
They've been out on
the streets too long.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.031
We need results.

04:09.118 --> 04:13.818
Everyone, run down your
own leads, stay in your lanes,

04:13.905 --> 04:17.039
too easy to influence
each other, pull focus.

04:17.126 --> 04:19.694
Whoever gets me
a smoking gun first

04:19.781 --> 04:23.872
I'm shifting all
resources to their team.

04:23.959 --> 04:28.224
America needs to see
someone in handcuffs
dragged into Guantanamo.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.249
I need to talk
to the head of the labs.

04:53.336 --> 04:55.338
Chris, why don't you
pull access records?

04:55.425 --> 04:57.471
Okay.
I'll flag anybody who
was working unusual hours

04:57.558 --> 05:00.038
in BSL three and four around
the time of the mailing.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.780
Yeah, start
with the day after 9/11.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.521
- After?
- Yeah.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.175
The powder in the attack
letter is cruder than in

05:06.262 --> 05:08.351
the second batch like
it was made in a hurry,

05:08.438 --> 05:11.136
probably in
response to the towers.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.225
You're
turning the microscope
on the same scientist

05:13.313 --> 05:15.010
you're asking
help solve this.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.838
Got everybody on edge.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.448
Dr. Livingston, why
did you team drag its feet

05:18.535 --> 05:20.929
submitting
samples under subpoena?

05:21.016 --> 05:23.279
Do you have
any idea how overtaxed this
place has been since 9/11?

05:23.366 --> 05:24.933
I got a
pretty good idea.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.326
Our samples
should be arriving at

05:26.413 --> 05:28.458
your repository
in Arizona today.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.417
Other labs submitted
to the subpoena days ago.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.853
Yeah.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.724
I've spoken to
some of those labs.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.858
They don't have agents running
all over their facility.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.642
Why do
you think that is?

05:40.862 --> 05:42.211
We wouldn't be here if
we didn't have evidence

05:42.298 --> 05:44.387
leading us back to USAMRIID.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.389
We're gonna
need to see psych evals on

05:46.476 --> 05:48.522
all personnel with
access to level three and

05:48.609 --> 05:50.045
level four hot suites.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.176
Psych evaluations?

05:51.263 --> 05:53.135
I mean, we don't do those.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.224
You're telling me you
have scientists working with

05:55.311 --> 05:58.140
every lethal pathogen
on this planet,

05:58.227 --> 06:01.186
and no one ever
thought to monitor
their mental stability?

06:05.495 --> 06:07.628
Okay, well, then we
need every personnel file.

06:51.367 --> 06:55.197
I've got another one,
left the lab a little late,

06:55.284 --> 06:57.155
entered the hot suite alone,

06:57.242 --> 06:59.114
stayed for two hours.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.553
Add the name.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.990
I'll go see if Dani has
flagged anyone on the list.

07:30.101 --> 07:33.757
You delayed submitting
your anthrax samples for weeks.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.020
Arizona says you kept
calling for clarification

07:36.107 --> 07:37.544
on how to submit.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.023
So?

07:39.110 --> 07:40.503
So, it's
pretty simple, Bruce.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.765
I sent in the samples.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.201
They should have them by now.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.246
You used
the wrong slants.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.161
They won't accept it.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.292
Because those generic
slants they want a malarkey,

07:47.379 --> 07:48.729
mine are better.

07:48.816 --> 07:49.991
They
don't care, Bruce.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.688
Well, they should care.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.211
Does no one give a darn
about quality anymore?

07:53.298 --> 07:55.475
Just follow
their protocol, Bruce.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.781
You're making us look like
we've got something to hide.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.915
I've
told Arizona to dispose
of your submissions.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.307
We've promised that
you would comply and

08:02.394 --> 08:04.222
re-submit right away.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.182
I'm
not surprised, Adya,

08:07.269 --> 08:08.705
since you've been
best buddies with

08:08.792 --> 08:09.837
every FBI agent
who's walked in here.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.752
Jesus Christ.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.275
I didn't wanna be the
one to tell you but people are

08:13.362 --> 08:14.624
beginning to wonder
what side you're on.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.278
We're all
on the same side, Bruce.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.934
We
should all be careful.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.023
These are not
glorified cops with badges.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.199
Some of these
agents are scientists.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.722
And if you don't submit,

08:25.809 --> 08:26.941
they will sweep in
and do it for you.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.075
How's your anxiety?

08:31.162 --> 08:33.556
The Valium should help
get a handle on that.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.340
Have you noticed a difference
with the new dosage?

08:35.427 --> 08:37.125
We're under attack!

08:37.212 --> 08:39.344
There's no meds
that will fix that!

08:39.431 --> 08:43.000
HALSTROM:
We're here to handle how you
react to those situations.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.481
And was Baltimore the only
long drive you've taken lately

08:45.568 --> 08:47.004
or have there been others?

08:49.267 --> 08:50.965
We're
almost out of time.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.880
You missed
group therapy twice.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.969
Were you on one
of your drives?

08:58.886 --> 09:00.844
I went to see Mara.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.846
You said she
lived in upstate New York.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.674
Why did you go see her?

09:11.855 --> 09:14.075
I must
have been really mad.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.734
HALSTROM:
Did you have your gun?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.088
What did you do, Bruce?

09:34.965 --> 09:37.272
I might have
put something in wine.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.973
But I didn't give it to her.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.195
I realized...

09:50.938 --> 09:54.202
It's like that poem,

09:54.289 --> 09:55.551
and all those emails,

09:55.638 --> 09:56.813
I find after
I've sent them and

09:56.900 --> 09:59.076
I don't remember.

10:04.952 --> 10:08.303
This is all
confidential, isn't it?

10:08.390 --> 10:11.654
Yes.

10:11.741 --> 10:16.485
Unless I feel that you are
becoming a threat to yourself,

10:16.572 --> 10:18.139
or to others.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.886
Thank you
so much for agreeing to
sit down with me today.

10:25.973 --> 10:30.107
I understand how
disruptive this is.

10:30.194 --> 10:34.764
And I know you guys
are all professionals
protecting America and

10:34.851 --> 10:38.550
it's exactly what
this interview is
going to prove today.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.205
So let's start by
talking a little bit about

10:41.292 --> 10:43.817
some of your coworkers.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.907
Tell me about Dr. Kurz.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.170
Does he have any
connections overseas,

10:49.257 --> 10:51.651
maybe the Middle East?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.609
Not that I know of.

10:53.696 --> 10:57.134
He is very dedicated,
doesn't joke around much.

10:57.221 --> 11:00.921
What's it like, uh,
working for Dr. Livingston?

11:01.008 --> 11:02.879
Do you ever hear her
criticize the government?

11:02.966 --> 11:05.447
Well, no more
than anyone else nowadays.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.145
Not sure, uh,
honestly it took a while
to get to know her.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.365
She's made some amazing
breakthroughs here though.

11:10.452 --> 11:16.763
TORETTI:
I have heard nothing but good
things about, uh, Dr. Ivins.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.156
Ivins,
what can you say?

11:19.243 --> 11:20.549
Bruce is Bruce.

11:20.636 --> 11:21.898
He's always
quick with the joke,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.900
he's a seriously
good researcher.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.468
I had to cut this tree down in
my yard and who shows up on a,

11:26.555 --> 11:28.818
on a Saturday with a chainsaw.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.472
Helped me out with
some vaccine research.

11:30.559 --> 11:34.258
And nobody has
a better sense of humor.

11:34.345 --> 11:39.568
TORETTI:
I have heard nothing but good
things about Bruce Ivins.

11:41.483 --> 11:47.097
Bruce,
he's kind of a...

11:47.184 --> 11:48.882
I mean...

11:52.799 --> 11:55.715
Um, he's, uh,
how do I say it?

11:57.978 --> 12:00.720
And odd duck?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.330
I don't know what to tell you.

12:56.558 --> 12:59.866
Have you guys
come across Bruce Ivins?

12:59.953 --> 13:02.782
Uh, yes, he was on
the late-night access list.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.348
Why, did
he say something?

13:04.435 --> 13:05.959
I haven't
interviewed him yet but

13:06.046 --> 13:09.092
it's more what
everybody isn't saying.

13:09.179 --> 13:14.228
The men really love
this guy but there's
something with the women,

13:14.315 --> 13:16.012
and I've talked to several and

13:16.099 --> 13:17.884
he makes them
really uncomfortable.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.537
Okay.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.018
So he's not exactly
smooth with the ladies,

13:22.105 --> 13:23.150
how does that
link him to terrorism?

13:23.237 --> 13:24.804
Well, it doesn't.

13:24.891 --> 13:28.024
I'm just looking for
any behavior that flags.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.765
Did you guys get
into the emails yet?

13:29.852 --> 13:32.376
Yeah, they're
scattered in there.

13:32.463 --> 13:33.900
We have 20,000 of them.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.205
Server pulls them
in chronologically.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.730
Be my guest.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.783
Sykes, you up to
speed yet on Amerithrax?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.263
I've been
following it for months, sir,

13:49.350 --> 13:50.394
glad to be on board.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.092
Mm-hmm.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.441
I just, uh, I'm
wondering if first team

13:53.528 --> 13:55.399
isn't maybe
veering off-course?

13:55.486 --> 13:59.490
Heard Ryker's been taking
up a lot of resources and...

13:59.577 --> 14:02.667
We tend to be more direct
within these walls, Sykes.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.756
What do you got?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.934
A tip from
some sources overseas.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.762
I know when they
were record sniffing.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.677
Take a look.

14:12.764 --> 14:16.551
If you see something there,
I wanna head up this team.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.599
You could put Ryker
back on petri dish duty.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.488
I think I
just found something.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.185
What's it say?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.845
"I'm a little
dream self, short and stout.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.848
I'm the other half of
Bruce when he lets me out."

14:54.676 --> 14:57.070
Is that
good enough for you?

14:57.157 --> 15:00.464
Can I do a preliminary
inquiry now?

15:54.127 --> 15:56.172
Sorry, Helen.

15:56.259 --> 15:57.652
It's okay, I'll clean it up.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.831
It should be fine.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.076
I love it. You too?

17:14.163 --> 17:16.252
Yeah, me too.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.429
That lone wolf
profile you sent to the
microbiology community.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.649
Yeah.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.216
Remember that
hit we got in Seattle?

17:23.303 --> 17:26.175
Her name is
Dr. Nancy Haigwood.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.872
Thought
that was a dead end.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.744
Yeah, so did the
superior who shelved it.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.659
But there was a newer agent
who did the right thing and

17:31.746 --> 17:34.009
tried to send it up
the chain but got shot down.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.708
The point is, Dr. Haigwood
claims that Bruce Ivins

17:37.795 --> 17:41.843
stalked her in grad school,
moved down the block from her,

17:41.930 --> 17:43.801
and even vandalized her house.

17:43.888 --> 17:46.282
And get this, at one point,

17:46.369 --> 17:47.979
her dissertation
notebook was stolen.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.156
And whoever took it left
a trail of clues for her

17:50.243 --> 17:52.897
to find it using
a USPS mailbox.

17:54.595 --> 17:57.163
The problem is, all
of this is anecdotal.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.773
Oh, come on.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.340
He screwed up his
repository submissions.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.950
He's clocking
late night lab hours...

18:02.037 --> 18:03.778
- Mm-hmm.
- Alone.

18:03.865 --> 18:04.909
All at the time of
the attack letters but that

18:04.996 --> 18:06.694
doesn't get us into court.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.348
Well, I took
some of the emails home for

18:08.435 --> 18:11.873
little bedtime reading,
no comments please.

18:11.960 --> 18:17.748
This one, "My shrink says I have
a paranoid personality disorder,

18:17.835 --> 18:19.489
an early sign
of schizophrenia,

18:19.576 --> 18:22.927
I am becoming a person
I do not want to be."

18:25.234 --> 18:28.455
No, what we need is
a direct link to the letters.

18:28.542 --> 18:31.240
The language in
his emails is eerily similar.

18:31.327 --> 18:34.635
There's another one
here to an old coworker,

18:34.722 --> 18:38.726
"Osama Bin Laden has
now decreed death on
all Jews and Americans."

18:38.813 --> 18:40.728
Those letters were
published in all the papers.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.599
He could just be
mirroring the language.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.603
No, look at
the date, September 26.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.824
We didn't find the
first attack letters
until three weeks later.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.492
Dammit, Bruce!

19:05.579 --> 19:06.710
You scared me.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.672
Now step back,
they're anthrax spores.

19:11.759 --> 19:15.415
They have you working
on the vaccine, don't they?

19:15.502 --> 19:18.026
That used to be my job.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.551
A lot of changes around here.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.818
It's okay.

19:30.604 --> 19:31.996
I'm the one that
made you lose your grip.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.781
I'll clean it up.

19:49.710 --> 19:53.279
Does Copak know
you're circling USAMRIID?

19:53.366 --> 19:55.063
Do you even have a suspect or

19:55.150 --> 19:58.109
you're just throwing
a little gasoline on the weeds

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
to see if any snakes
comes slithering out?

20:01.852 --> 20:03.811
Eyes on
your own page, Ryker.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.160
We're all supposed to
follow our own lead so

20:05.247 --> 20:08.337
we don't influence each other.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.339
That doesn't mean
pitching a circus tent in

20:10.426 --> 20:14.387
the middle of someone
else's investigation.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.701
LIVINGSTON:
No one thought this was
possible but you can see,

20:24.788 --> 20:27.922
plain as day, different
colonies of Ames with

20:28.009 --> 20:30.272
identifiable characteristics.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.754
How did you
make the colonies morph?

20:33.841 --> 20:35.973
LIVINGSTON:
It wasn't intentional.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.367
It was one of our
ongoing anthrax projects,

20:38.454 --> 20:41.936
a colleague got busy,
the cultures overgrew.

20:42.023 --> 20:45.156
We never considered
incubation time as a factor.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.854
Arizona's been trying
to sequence the genomes

20:46.941 --> 20:50.292
all this time and you
just stumbled upon this?

20:50.379 --> 20:52.729
Even with
all these minds and brains,

20:52.816 --> 20:56.690
accidents are often how the
biggest breakthroughs happen.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.301
If we can identify
a specific morph in the spores

20:59.388 --> 21:01.825
of the attack letters then match
it to the subpoenaed samples,

21:01.912 --> 21:03.653
we've got our smoking gun.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.351
Once I can
get back into the BSL4 lab,

21:05.438 --> 21:07.614
I will forward
you my findings.

21:07.701 --> 21:09.050
What do you
mean back into the lab?

21:09.137 --> 21:11.052
LIVINGSTON:
Well, we had a spill.

21:11.139 --> 21:12.836
Bruce surprised me,

21:12.923 --> 21:14.534
I didn't see him so
I knocked over a tray.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.318
Wait.
Dr. Ivins was there?

21:18.015 --> 21:19.626
He's been
pretty edgy lately,

21:19.713 --> 21:22.672
sees me as a traitor for
working with the Bureau.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.631
Did he leave
the lab with you?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.720
No, he took it
upon himself to decon the area

21:26.807 --> 21:28.591
and some nearby offices.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.289
- Including his?
- Yeah.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.378
Brought in a whole team.

21:32.465 --> 21:36.251
It's a little overboard if
you ask me but that's Bruce.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.819
Our number one
suspect just cleaned
up his own crime scene.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.864
I got to bring
in Ivins tonight.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.736
What? No.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.912
We don't have enough
ammo to confront him.

21:44.999 --> 21:48.437
He could
literally be destroying
evidence as we speak.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.571
Let me just try to dig
up something from his past,

21:51.658 --> 21:55.009
something that can push
his buttons, uh, a motive.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.490
Go ahead and track down
his childhood sled if you want.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.492
If he knows
we're circling him,

21:59.579 --> 22:01.450
the cleanup
might not end here.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.670
He could head home and destroy
anything incriminating.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.020
We may only have one
shot at a confession here and

22:06.107 --> 22:07.848
he is not primed for it.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.545
And if we
give him more time,

22:09.632 --> 22:11.591
we may lose any chance
we have at nailing him.

22:11.678 --> 22:15.377
He's making rash moves,
I'm ordering a polygraph.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.510
If you're
determined to do this,

22:17.597 --> 22:20.948
the way in has to be
through his hero's complex.

22:21.035 --> 22:22.689
He wants to
prove how smart he is.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.212
We get him talking...

22:24.299 --> 22:25.169
It's not my
first interrogation,

22:25.256 --> 22:26.214
I got it.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.522
<i>DISPATCH : </i>
Lebanon PD, how can I help?

22:29.609 --> 22:31.828
Agent
Toretti FBI here,

22:31.915 --> 22:35.092
I am looking for some
information on a former
resident, Bruce Ivins.

22:35.179 --> 22:39.445
I'd be interested in anything
from his early years in Ohio,

22:39.532 --> 22:41.534
should narrow your search
down to '50s and '60s.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.013
<i>DISPATCH : </i>
I'll see what I can find.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.624
Okay, um,
I'll actually hold.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.755
<i>DISPATCH : </i>
No problem.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.990
- Dr. Ivins?
- Yeah.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.224
<i>IVINS : I </i>
hear you're one of us.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.444
A microbiologist.

23:22.531 --> 23:25.360
I am.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.363
A microbiologist
in the FBI.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.191
Neat.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.543
Uh, before they
administer the polygraph,

23:34.630 --> 23:36.632
I thought I'd ask you
a few questions about

23:36.719 --> 23:38.808
the samples you
submitted to us.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.202
Oh, yeah.

23:41.289 --> 23:44.684
Well, I already got
an earful about my misstep.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.774
So you
intentionally submitted

23:47.861 --> 23:49.950
inadequate anthrax
samples under subpoena?

23:50.037 --> 23:52.300
Yes.

23:52.387 --> 23:56.609
But only because
the slants you guys
requested were inferior.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.394
And the weeks
leading up to September
18th, 2001, uh,

23:59.481 --> 24:01.831
the postmark date of
the first attack letter,

24:01.918 --> 24:07.054
did you work extra hours,
unaccompanied hours in the

24:07.141 --> 24:11.711
BSL4 lab with
Bacillus Anthracis Ames?

24:11.798 --> 24:15.149
After 9/11 everyone
at USAMRIID was working late.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.547
You recognize
this post office?

24:21.634 --> 24:24.463
Yeah.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.726
Did you ever purchase
pre-stamped envelopes

24:26.813 --> 24:28.815
at this post office?

24:28.902 --> 24:30.556
A couple
of times I guess.

24:33.776 --> 24:38.259
What about this email,

24:38.346 --> 24:41.392
referencing anthrax
and Saddam Hussein?

24:45.788 --> 24:47.747
You read
my personal emails?

24:51.446 --> 24:53.013
You know that was a joke?

24:57.408 --> 24:59.019
What about these?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.199
Did you do this, Dr. Ivins?

25:08.463 --> 25:10.421
You talked to Nancy?

25:16.036 --> 25:19.561
How is a stupid thing
that I did 20 years ago
at all relevant?

25:21.128 --> 25:22.825
Okay. Fine, yes.

25:25.349 --> 25:29.484
When I was younger, I had
obsessive behaviors linked
to sororities specifically,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.312
Kappa Kappa Gamma, of which

25:31.399 --> 25:33.140
Nancy Haigwood was an alumna.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.536
Is it peculiar? Yes.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.234
Can I explain it? Nope.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.065
Happy?

25:52.725 --> 25:54.944
You know, that's not
the only thing I did.

25:57.643 --> 26:01.255
What else, Dr. Ivins?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.910
I let myself
into a sorority house,

26:03.997 --> 26:06.347
two actually.

26:06.434 --> 26:10.656
I stole their ritual book
and a cypher to decode it.

26:12.266 --> 26:13.789
No one ever suspected me.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.533
But I didn't hurt anyone.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.017
See, I'm not hiding anything.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.020
Aren't you?

26:27.107 --> 26:29.457
Didn't you email a colleague,

26:29.544 --> 26:34.244
another friend on
numerous occasions
about a different, Bruce?

26:34.331 --> 26:37.726
Saying that you
were concerned about
your psychological state.

26:39.772 --> 26:44.298
Did you ever experience
extreme anxiety, dissociation?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.739
I know
what you're doing.

26:55.309 --> 27:02.185
Look, I may not be
the most popular guy.

27:02.272 --> 27:06.668
There might even be
a few people who have said
I'm odd behind my back.

27:08.670 --> 27:11.934
But does that
make me a killer?

27:12.021 --> 27:16.896
I mean, when are
you guys gonna realize
I'm here to help you?

27:23.032 --> 27:25.382
Yes. Fine, yes.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.881
How'd you even
end up doing this,

27:47.927 --> 27:52.235
a microbiologist in the FBI?

27:52.322 --> 27:54.934
Pathogen biology is
a pretty competitive field.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.197
We can't all
be the ones making
scientific breakthroughs,

27:57.284 --> 27:58.851
I suppose, but.

27:58.938 --> 28:00.374
I wanted
to serve my country.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.595
Is that what
you tell yourself?

28:08.164 --> 28:10.297
<i>IVINS : </i>
Because I can't
imagine going in and see...

28:10.384 --> 28:12.038
Ryker's already
burned through most of
what we've got on him.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.387
<i>IVINS : </i>
Of wearing a suit at a desk.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.171
You know,
silver bullets.

28:15.258 --> 28:16.390
<i>RYKER : </i>
That's not for everybody.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.218
<i>IVINS : Oh, okay.</i>

28:18.305 --> 28:20.394
Maybe a splinter,
enough to irritate him and

28:20.481 --> 28:22.135
get his walls down.

28:22.222 --> 28:24.441
<i>IVINS : </i>
I am curious, though.

28:24.528 --> 28:27.880
<i>What went wrong with your </i>
dissertation, Agent Ryker?

28:27.967 --> 28:30.186
Mistaking a eukaryotic
cell for a prokaryotic?

28:34.321 --> 28:36.671
I knew plenty of guys
like you in college.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.413
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.937
Ivins is
feeling empowered.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.852
<i>IVINS : I can </i>
tell half a dozen in the
halls around the labs...

28:43.939 --> 28:46.202
He should get him to
open up and if he loosens up

28:46.289 --> 28:48.509
then maybe I can get some
answers about his past.

28:48.596 --> 28:52.774
<i>IVINS : This guy </i>
is just, you know, smart.

28:52.861 --> 28:55.298
But it didn't matter
how hard they studied,

28:55.385 --> 28:58.911
they just didn't
have the imagination.

29:01.087 --> 29:04.873
It does take
a unique blend of talents,

29:04.960 --> 29:10.400
plus a willingness to
skate on the edge which

29:10.487 --> 29:12.576
I'm guessing is
difficult for you.

29:14.796 --> 29:20.106
But hey, would a sane
person tie a key to
a kite in a thunderstorm?

29:23.022 --> 29:24.458
You know that
Franklin didn't actually

29:24.545 --> 29:26.852
fly the kite in
that storm, right?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.505
He had his son do it.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.945
Even noble people do
unforgivable things,

29:33.032 --> 29:34.642
don't they?

29:36.296 --> 29:39.429
You're
missing my point.

29:39.516 --> 29:42.345
Are you familiar with
the Stentor Roeselii?

29:42.432 --> 29:46.132
It's a single-celled
ciliate micro-organism
capable of making intelligent,

29:46.219 --> 29:48.047
complex decisions
all without the help

29:48.134 --> 29:50.440
of a central nervous system.

29:50.527 --> 29:53.269
Zero support.

29:53.356 --> 29:57.012
No other organism on earth
has such an innate gift.

29:57.099 --> 29:59.885
Is that how
you see yourself?

29:59.972 --> 30:03.845
Some sort of
gifted Stentor Roeselii?

30:03.932 --> 30:07.196
What does that
make guys like me?

30:07.283 --> 30:10.547
Plasmodial slime mold?

30:10.634 --> 30:14.595
Think about it,
I know most Americans
aren't paying attention,

30:14.682 --> 30:18.729
but you guys had signs,
that 9/11 was gonna happen.

30:18.817 --> 30:23.909
Flight lessons, a warning
of an attack on New York.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.781
And now, you can't figure
out who sent these letters.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.438
All the hours you put in
and you just can't measure up.

30:33.527 --> 30:39.446
So instead, you are harassing
hard-working patriots like me.

30:42.971 --> 30:47.628
Have you even done
your homework, Agent Ryker?

30:47.715 --> 30:51.980
I mean, what
about Thompson, Benjadi,

30:52.067 --> 30:53.634
or even Kurz?

30:55.375 --> 30:57.594
There are plenty of
people with my same access.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.728
But they
didn't point the finger at
their colleagues, did they?

31:00.815 --> 31:03.992
You're the only doing that.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.689
<i>RYKER : </i>
Here's what I think.

31:05.776 --> 31:08.431
No. No. No, no.

31:08.518 --> 31:09.955
<i>RYKER : Just like </i>
the clue you left Haigwood
to find her notebook...

31:10.042 --> 31:13.175
I think you
wanna be found out.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.612
This is some sort of
twisted experiment, isn't it?

31:17.484 --> 31:19.268
<i>TORETTI : </i>
Uh, sorry, Agent Ryker.

31:19.355 --> 31:20.356
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

31:20.443 --> 31:21.836
Oh, it's okay.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.751
We have a few
more questions to go.

31:23.838 --> 31:27.102
TORETTI:
Good, I have another one,
if that's all right.

31:27.189 --> 31:31.280
- Mr. Ivins...
- Doctor.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.543
It's Dr. Ivins.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.328
And you are who again?

31:35.415 --> 31:37.417
Oh, I'm just
another hunk of slime mold.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.595
Doctor Ivins,
in your own words,

31:41.682 --> 31:43.597
can you describe
your childhood for me?

31:46.382 --> 31:48.863
I don't see what that
has to do with any of this.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.822
TORETTI:
Maybe it's better we focus
on one event in particular.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.002
The police responded to a

31:57.089 --> 31:59.352
domestic disturbance
to your house.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.878
Did you witness
your mother's attack?

32:09.928 --> 32:12.974
This was an accident.

32:13.061 --> 32:18.153
Neighbors described
your mother as unpredictable,
irrational, and violent.

32:25.421 --> 32:27.380
You were there,
weren't you, Bruce?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.910
Are we
almost done here?

32:35.997 --> 32:37.477
Childhood trauma
can have a lasting effect

32:37.564 --> 32:40.654
on a person.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.222
Did your mother
ever hurt you, Bruce?

32:47.269 --> 32:50.707
My mother loved me.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.971
She loved me very much.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.080
Now, Doctor Ivins,

33:15.167 --> 33:16.690
you understand that
your appearance here today

33:16.777 --> 33:18.909
and taking this
polygraph test is voluntary?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.389
Yes.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.444
To
establish a baseline,

33:31.531 --> 33:33.924
is your name
Bruce Edwards Ivins?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.752
Yes.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.493
Were you
born in Lebanon, Ohio?

33:37.580 --> 33:41.106
- Yes.
- Hmm. Okay.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.766
<i>OPERATOR : </i>
Now, we are going to run
something called a stim test.

33:49.853 --> 33:51.594
To measure
my adrenal response.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.031
I'm
gonna need you to lie

33:53.118 --> 33:54.858
when you answer
my next question.

33:54.945 --> 33:56.643
That will give us indicators
to look for if you lie in

33:56.730 --> 33:59.428
response to a later question.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.039
But I'm not
gonna lie to you.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.173
Are you
a time traveler?

34:08.002 --> 34:12.093
Sorry. Yes,
I am a time traveler.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.880
Last
question, Doctor Ivins.

34:16.967 --> 34:21.363
In the fall of 2001,
did you mail letters
containing Anthrax via the

34:21.450 --> 34:23.757
United States Postal Service?

34:27.369 --> 34:29.110
No.

34:40.948 --> 34:42.906
You get
any hits off him?

34:42.993 --> 34:45.126
OPERATOR:
We got a good read on the
baseline for comparison.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.563
Where did he lie?

34:47.650 --> 34:50.044
Some lines
indicated elevated stress,

34:50.131 --> 34:52.090
but no answer
showed deception.

34:55.136 --> 34:58.052
What about
when you asked if he
mailed the attack letters?

34:58.139 --> 35:01.099
No, it looks
like he's not your guy.

35:37.178 --> 35:41.530
So, I told him
exactly what I thought.

35:41.617 --> 35:45.665
That he wasn't
supporting me in my decision.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.407
I used exactly the words
that we discussed and

35:48.494 --> 35:50.365
you know what?

35:50.452 --> 35:52.802
He shut his trap for
the rest of the night.
It worked.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.369
Oh.

35:54.456 --> 35:55.327
That's
really great to hear.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.545
Yeah.

35:56.632 --> 36:00.288
Bruce? Bruce?

36:00.375 --> 36:02.508
Would you like to
tell us about your week?

36:05.641 --> 36:09.471
Yeah,
it was wonderful.

36:09.558 --> 36:12.300
Very productive.

36:14.868 --> 36:18.698
Ryker, I made some
calls and it's debatable.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.787
It, it's not the easiest
to trick a poly.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.137
Unless he's a
complete sociopath.

36:23.224 --> 36:27.228
Hmm.
What's your gut say?

36:27.315 --> 36:30.971
I think he
felt like he had the
upper hand with you.

36:31.058 --> 36:33.016
That might have
put him at ease and

36:33.103 --> 36:34.714
thrown his vitals off.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.194
So, you're
saying I screwed up?

36:36.281 --> 36:38.457
No, it
was a solid tactic,

36:38.544 --> 36:41.068
but I think it is
safe to say that your
cracks were showing through

36:41.155 --> 36:43.026
that perfectly
pressed suit of yours.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.510
All right, Sykes,
what do you got?

36:50.730 --> 36:52.819
Who the hell is that?

36:52.906 --> 36:55.474
Steven Hatfill
received his medical
training in Africa.

36:55.561 --> 36:57.998
Hatfill just happened to be on
the ground in Rhodesia during

36:58.085 --> 37:00.914
the most deadly Anthrax
outbreak in recent history.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.351
He trained first responders
on bioweapon threats,

37:03.438 --> 37:07.312
which would include anthrax.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.836
Do you have
a direct link between
Hatfill and the letters?

37:09.923 --> 37:12.491
It says right here
he's a virologist.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.493
A virus guy, not bacteria.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.235
About his
science background,

37:17.322 --> 37:21.848
Mr. Hatfill claimed
to have a degree that
there's no record of.

37:21.935 --> 37:23.676
And to be a part of
a royal medical society

37:23.763 --> 37:26.156
that hasn't heard of him.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.464
A few people in
this room have resumes that
look better than reality.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.467
You can't just pick up
anthrax at a local drugstore.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.513
Do we have proof that
he had access to it?

37:34.600 --> 37:37.429
Actually, Hatfill
did work at USAMRIID.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.344
For two years.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.520
Now, we don't know yet what
Hatfill had access to then,

37:41.607 --> 37:44.479
but we do know
that he tried to get
higher security clearances.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.786
One of which was
suspended before 9/11.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.179
And if he wasn't
handling deadly bacteria,

37:49.267 --> 37:50.746
wanna tell me why
he was taking Cipro at

37:50.833 --> 37:52.705
the time the attack
letters were mailed?

37:52.792 --> 37:56.361
All right.
Our top suspect is Hatfill.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.450
Ryker, I'm putting
you on Sykes' team.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.452
He's short a science guy.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.280
Does that include me?

38:02.367 --> 38:05.370
No, he's already
got a behavioral analyst.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.197
Head up to the fifth
floor for reassignment.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.547
You too, Agent Moore.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.986
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.989
- I'm staying on Ivins.
- Really?

38:16.076 --> 38:18.818
I mean, the guy
passed his polygraph
like a valedictorian.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.385
They don't have any
more on Hatfill than we do

38:20.472 --> 38:22.517
on Ivins and the
science doesn't add up.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.302
But, you know, if
they make Hatfill the target,

38:24.389 --> 38:26.042
we are gonna catch hell
for veering off course.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.914
No, I'll be
the one to catch hell

38:28.001 --> 38:29.611
because I'm the only
one who is reassigned.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.265
All right. I'm in.

38:38.098 --> 38:40.143
What's the plan?

38:44.539 --> 38:46.367
What do you think about
seeing if one of the people

38:46.454 --> 38:49.065
that Bruce
confided in, emailed,

38:49.152 --> 38:51.938
would be willing
to contact him?

38:52.025 --> 38:53.461
I don't think
he's gonna confess like that,

38:53.548 --> 38:55.681
but it is worth a shot.

38:55.768 --> 38:58.161
Chris, I need
you to surveil him.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.033
See what he does
in his downtime.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.513
Especially if he thinks he
sailed through the polygraph,

39:01.600 --> 39:02.731
he might make
a misstep we can use.

39:02.818 --> 39:04.080
Okay.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.344
And what about you?

39:06.431 --> 39:08.694
Looks like I'm
stuck playing science guy for

39:08.781 --> 39:10.348
Sykes's wild goose chase.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.003
I'll check in when I can.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.265
All right.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.220
Excuse me, sir.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.657
Have you found
the Anthrax Killer?

40:02.878 --> 40:05.011
Is the suspect
in custody, sir?

40:05.098 --> 40:07.056
REPORTER 2:
The citizens deserve to
know, are we in danger, sir?

40:07.143 --> 40:10.320
Another inexplicable
leak to the press,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.758
complete with a circus.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.847
You're going to let the
public indict this guy before

40:14.934 --> 40:16.979
we have any physical evidence?

40:17.066 --> 40:18.894
Where is Hatfill, anyway?

40:18.981 --> 40:21.114
Got him at a motel.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.332
He thinks we're
doing this to everyone
who's worked at USAMRIID.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.813
Come on.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.293
Meet Tinkerbell
and her cohort.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.124
Let's give them the scent.

40:35.520 --> 40:40.829
I just need
visual confirmation
on air sample 23-Q37

40:40.916 --> 40:43.266
from the letter that
Senator Daschle received.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.094
Confirmed.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.672
All right, boys.

40:57.759 --> 40:58.891
There you go.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.069
Okay.

41:03.156 --> 41:04.374
All right, boy,
you got it.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.637
Find it, find it.

41:34.927 --> 41:36.189
What do you know?

41:38.931 --> 41:39.888
Hatfill's place.

41:41.934 --> 41:42.848
Suit up.

41:50.290 --> 41:54.207
So, I'm in
the back of a truck in
freakin' Rhodesia, right?

41:54.294 --> 41:56.514
And who ambushes us?

41:56.601 --> 41:58.167
Marxist rebels.

41:58.254 --> 41:59.517
You're kidding me.

41:59.604 --> 42:00.866
What
choice do I have?

42:00.953 --> 42:02.520
I leap off the
back of a truck,

42:02.607 --> 42:04.783
but I forget that
I have a pack on,

42:04.870 --> 42:07.437
I fall flat on my face
and break my damn nose!

42:09.048 --> 42:10.440
I, I couldn't
breathe right for years!

None were a match to the
Anthrax used in the letters.

45:02.003 --> 45:04.832
<i>Hope that answers </i>
any questions about
the integrity of our team.

45:08.923 --> 45:14.233
Thank you, um,
I'll, uh, I'll be in touch.

45:19.107 --> 45:21.588
We got the
warrant for the storage unit.

47:56.351 --> 47:57.787

47:57.875 --> 47:59.659
Hatfill has a
map to Camp David.

48:17.242 --> 48:18.939

48:27.165 --> 48:30.559

location in the woods.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.739
You still think
we got the wrong guy?

48:54.932 --> 48:56.890
