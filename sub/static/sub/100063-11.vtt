you can't help but feel awed

00:30.826 --> 00:33.383

00:55.701 --> 00:57.679
How's the surfing going?

00:57.703 --> 00:59.447
Not too bad. I just caught
an eight-second barrel

00:59.471 --> 01:00.515
out at Pipeline the other day.

01:00.539 --> 01:02.851
Eight seconds. Nice.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.586
It's a nice set of wheels you got here.

(CHUCKLES): Last time we, uh,
sat down, it was a little tense,

- You're being activated

01:48.287 --> 01:49.619
for a special operation.

01:50.956 --> 01:53.167
Need you to snatch and grab Marwan Hayek.

01:53.191 --> 01:55.169
Hayek.

01:55.193 --> 01:57.772
- He's resurfaced again, huh?
- We got HUMINT

01:57.796 --> 01:59.374
that says he might be holed up
in the Triple Frontier.

01:59.398 --> 02:01.175
Now, in case your geography's rusty...

02:01.199 --> 02:04.045
That's the no-man's-land between

One of the most lawless
areas on the planet.

02:06.939 --> 02:08.949
I suppose if I was a
fugitive arms dealer,

02:08.973 --> 02:10.318
it wouldn't be a bad place to hide.

02:10.342 --> 02:12.420
Apparently,
Hayek's still dealing weapons.

02:12.444 --> 02:14.789
Let me guess. You want me to
go down there under the guise

02:14.813 --> 02:17.225
of purchasing weapons and snatch Hayek?

02:17.249 --> 02:18.793
Using your old cover as an arms broker.

02:18.817 --> 02:20.528
Infiltrate him just like
you did in Afghanistan.

02:20.552 --> 02:22.530
Hopefully, this time, he won't slip away.

02:22.554 --> 02:24.638

- You got one.

02:24.662 --> 02:26.467
CIA case officer from Ground Branch

02:26.491 --> 02:28.870
and a DIA weapons analyst
to help sell your approach.

thinking Rick and TC could be...

I don't know who these guys are.

02:35.434 --> 02:36.611
I don't... I can't, I can't trust...

02:36.635 --> 02:38.346
Magnum, the answer is no.

02:38.370 --> 02:40.837
Everything's already in motion.
Understood?

02:42.874 --> 02:44.524
Understood, sir.

best way to snatch him up

mission in the Triple Frontier.

on Robin's Nest a few months back?

10:45.439 --> 10:47.450
He wanted to know the identity
of the Navy SEAL that

10:47.474 --> 10:49.519
the White Knight novels were
based on and-and details

10:49.543 --> 10:50.653
from operations mentioned in the novels.

10:50.677 --> 10:52.088
You have any idea who he is?

10:52.112 --> 10:53.556
No one does.

community's radar for years,

10:56.617 --> 10:58.795

11:00.120 --> 11:01.598
Why'd he want Thomas for this mission?

11:02.455 --> 11:03.855
They never said.

11:05.592 --> 11:07.438
I'll look into the men
who abducted your son.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.072
Okay?

11:09.096 --> 11:11.162
See if we can get any leads.

11:13.867 --> 11:16.312
If Thomas pulls off this op, then what?

11:16.336 --> 11:18.314
I mean, given the trap
that Ivan's boys laid

11:18.338 --> 11:21.985
for the captain, it doesn't seem
like he's a fan of loose ends.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.419
Which means that as soon as Magnum

11:23.443 --> 11:24.959
has completed this mission...

11:26.647 --> 11:29.948
...it's very likely that
Ivan will have him killed.

11:35.485 --> 11:37.029
Follow me.

11:37.053 --> 11:39.053
Hayek's waiting inside.

11:41.958 --> 11:44.036
We still have a mission to complete.

11:44.060 --> 11:47.072
With no guns, no plan,
and no idea where we are.

11:47.096 --> 11:48.807
Yeah.

11:48.831 --> 11:50.442
We'll improvise.

11:50.466 --> 11:52.578
Grab Hayek when we can
and get him to the airstrip.

11:52.602 --> 11:53.612
CURTIS: How?

11:53.636 --> 11:55.247
There are guards everywhere.

11:55.271 --> 11:56.582
Yeah, I know.

11:56.606 --> 11:58.417
I saw two guys at the front gate.

11:58.441 --> 12:01.142
I see at least three guys
walking the perimeter.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.189
I'm sure Sefu and his guys
never leave Hayek's side.

12:04.213 --> 12:07.511
Just got to figure out a way
to separate them from him.

12:07.512 --> 12:10.041
If we can grab Hayek, how do we escape?

12:10.042 --> 12:11.742
I mean, they got eyes on everything.

12:13.050 --> 12:14.416
Wait right here.

12:16.658 --> 12:19.761
The guards and cameras have
pretty much every area covered,

12:19.785 --> 12:21.756
except for that area over there.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.199
The SUV in the carport's
gonna be our best bet

12:24.223 --> 12:25.834
for a ride out of here,

12:25.858 --> 12:27.569
if we hotwire that car fast enough.

12:27.593 --> 12:30.038
Assuming we can even get to it.

12:30.062 --> 12:31.339
Hayek's got to have a lot more

12:31.363 --> 12:33.508
around this place than
just security guards.

12:33.532 --> 12:35.677
Like a whole lot of security sensors.

12:35.701 --> 12:37.579
MAGNUM: We'll figure it out.

12:37.603 --> 12:40.014
If Hayek's the control freak
that I know him to be,

12:40.038 --> 12:41.616
his security system probably runs

12:41.640 --> 12:42.917
to a computer in his office.

12:42.941 --> 12:44.686
Just got to find a way to get in there

12:44.710 --> 12:46.527
and hack into it.

12:46.551 --> 12:48.211
Oh, is that all?

didn't go exactly as planned.

of surface-to-air missiles.

13:29.621 --> 13:30.938
You got paid.

13:30.962 --> 13:32.467

13:32.491 --> 13:34.341
that pilfered them from the armory

13:34.365 --> 13:35.837
on our behalf were arrested.

13:35.861 --> 13:38.006
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

13:38.030 --> 13:40.775
They went after me, too, all right?

13:41.063 --> 13:42.374

13:42.398 --> 13:44.943

get a whole new team.

13:53.650 --> 13:55.053
In Kandahar,

13:55.077 --> 13:57.456
drinking crappy homemade wine,

13:57.480 --> 13:59.191
while I was working for the CIA.

13:59.215 --> 14:00.625

some real money, I took it.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.244
but unless you want to date me,

14:19.268 --> 14:21.079

and that someone else took him elsewhere.

22:30.527 --> 22:31.834
He may have seen something.

22:33.023 --> 22:34.088
Hey.

22:52.144 --> 22:54.068
Yeah, I saw him.

22:54.092 --> 22:56.770
He and two other guys took off
with some bad dudes.

22:56.794 --> 22:58.300
Yeah, you speak English.

22:58.324 --> 23:00.802
Been watching American TV my whole life.

23:00.803 --> 23:02.448
Murder, She Wrote;

23:02.472 --> 23:03.749
Dukes of Hazzard.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.918
"You dipstick!" Love that one.

23:05.942 --> 23:08.120
God bless '80s television, huh?

23:08.144 --> 23:09.855
{an8}RICK: So you think

23:09.879 --> 23:13.058
{an8}a spy satellite picked up the
SUV that Thomas drove away in?

23:13.082 --> 23:14.660
{an8}I'd be surprised if one didn't.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.296
{an8}And you get access
to these satellites through MI6?

23:17.320 --> 23:18.397
{an8}Not officially.

23:18.421 --> 23:19.531
SHAMMY: So you're, like,

23:19.555 --> 23:20.933
hacking into their system?

23:20.957 --> 23:22.701
Can we not talk
about how illegal this is?

23:22.725 --> 23:24.124
- (BEEPS)
- Okay, I have an image.

23:26.963 --> 23:28.941
RICK: And there's our boy.

23:28.965 --> 23:30.865
Okay, I'm gonna fast-forward it
to see where they took him.

23:32.602 --> 23:35.681
Okay, it appears to be nothing
but a single-lane unpaved road

23:35.705 --> 23:37.216
until we get to this compound

23:37.240 --> 23:39.485
about 180 kilometers north of here.

23:39.509 --> 23:41.153
Must be where Hayek is holed up.

23:41.177 --> 23:42.321
Which means Magnum may be well on his way

23:42.345 --> 23:43.489
to completing the mission.

23:43.513 --> 23:44.990
It could take hours to drive there.

23:45.014 --> 23:47.226
- By which time it might be too late.
- RICK: Well,

23:47.250 --> 23:48.894
I might know someone
that could get us there

23:48.918 --> 23:50.062
in a fraction of the time.

23:50.086 --> 23:51.096
Come on.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.265
Down here? You know a guy?

23:53.289 --> 23:55.623
Shammy, it's me.

24:00.062 --> 24:02.140
Well, this ought to do the trick, right?

24:02.164 --> 24:04.676
Dude, it's a drug-smuggling bird.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.845
Disguised as a medical relief chopper,

24:06.869 --> 24:08.276
which, I have to admit,

24:08.301 --> 24:09.562
- is pretty clever.
- (LAUGHING): Yeah.

24:09.587 --> 24:11.226
Rick, who exactly are
we borrowing this from?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.739
You know what? It's probably
better you don't ask.

24:12.770 --> 24:13.886
For the record, I was never here.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.954
Guys, we are in the Triple Frontier.

24:15.978 --> 24:18.657
Okay? You can't just go
to a rent-a-helo down here.

24:18.681 --> 24:20.159
Okay, now if anybody has a better idea

24:20.183 --> 24:22.082
where to find a chopper, speak up.

24:25.187 --> 24:27.466
Uh-huh. That's what I thought.

24:27.490 --> 24:29.842
Now, my guy also threw in

24:29.866 --> 24:31.570
a couple of guns.

24:31.594 --> 24:33.772
Who wants a rifle? Huh?

24:33.796 --> 24:35.374
I got an AK

24:35.398 --> 24:38.710
for you, and I got an AK for you.

24:38.734 --> 24:41.526
And I got an AK for you, Sham.

24:41.550 --> 24:43.649
- Oh, yeah.
- There you go.

24:43.673 --> 24:45.609
Who wants to party?

25:09.765 --> 25:11.577
Your analyst might not
be much of a talker,

25:11.601 --> 25:12.811
but he's a damn good pilot.

25:12.835 --> 25:13.979
(WHIRRING DOWN)

25:14.003 --> 25:15.636
Hardware checks out.

25:17.506 --> 25:19.351
Shall we discuss terms?

25:19.375 --> 25:21.853
I'd be happy to... in private.

25:21.877 --> 25:24.556
Private? It's the middle of the jungle.

25:24.580 --> 25:25.857
Exactly.

25:25.881 --> 25:27.593
Perfect place to hide
a directional microphone

25:27.617 --> 25:28.760
and eavesdrop on us.

25:28.784 --> 25:29.995
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

25:30.019 --> 25:31.430
You forget what happened in Afghanistan?

25:31.454 --> 25:33.732
You never know
who's watching or listening.

25:33.756 --> 25:35.334
Can't afford to take that risk.

25:35.358 --> 25:37.069
Let's talk in my office.

25:37.093 --> 25:38.525
That's secure.

25:43.599 --> 25:44.943
- Great flying.
- Thanks.

25:44.967 --> 25:47.201
Must have spent a lot of
time at Holloman, huh?

25:48.471 --> 25:50.148
Air Force Base. Drone training?

25:50.172 --> 25:51.450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:51.474 --> 25:53.085
Sorry, I spaced for a second.

25:53.109 --> 25:54.886
Must still be in flight mode. (CHUCKLES)

25:54.910 --> 25:56.088
Fine. Don't worry about it.

25:56.112 --> 25:57.487
The only thing I remember about Holloman

25:57.511 --> 25:59.691
was, uh, Sally's Cheesesteaks.

25:59.715 --> 26:02.828
Great food, terrible service. Am I right?

26:02.852 --> 26:04.696
(CHUCKLING): Yeah, pretty awful.

26:05.422 --> 26:06.865
Man.

26:06.889 --> 26:08.900
Don't know why I'm so nervous still.

26:08.924 --> 26:10.869
Don't worry about it.

26:10.893 --> 26:12.137
You're doing great.

26:12.161 --> 26:13.961
We're almost done.

26:18.434 --> 26:20.479
Hey, Hayek?

26:21.163 --> 26:22.547
Anybody ever tell you

26:22.571 --> 26:25.584
that, uh, you have impeccable taste?

26:25.608 --> 26:28.812
Many, usually right before they
ask me for a discount in price,

26:28.836 --> 26:30.656
but I'm sure you would never
play me like that.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.958
Me? Come on, man. Never.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.482
(GRUNTING)

26:38.454 --> 26:41.333
(GROANING)

26:41.357 --> 26:42.801
Yell and you die.

26:42.825 --> 26:44.391
Find something to gag him with.

26:47.329 --> 26:49.430

27:10.786 --> 27:12.330
They heard you bust that window.

27:12.354 --> 27:13.699
They're coming.

27:13.723 --> 27:16.660
I'm almost there. Just keep
an eye out, both of you.

27:46.404 --> 27:48.188
(MUFFLED): What are you doing?

27:49.840 --> 27:51.470
What are you doing?!

27:51.494 --> 27:53.572
I was supposed to snatch you up,
along with two other guys

27:53.596 --> 27:54.947
who aren't who they say
they are, kind of like you.

27:54.971 --> 27:56.880
- What are you talking about?
- I know you're an informant

27:56.904 --> 27:59.144
for the U.S. government.
I saw the e-mails.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.546
Who put you up to this?

28:01.570 --> 28:02.914
I don't know.

28:02.938 --> 28:05.167
Probably the same guys
you're ratting out to the Feds.

28:08.077 --> 28:10.911
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

28:18.234 --> 28:20.234
Let's go. Come on.

28:25.661 --> 28:27.339
Our gas tank's shredded.

28:27.363 --> 28:28.673
So what now?

28:28.697 --> 28:31.042
We're gonna have to
move on foot. And fast.

28:31.066 --> 28:33.153
They're gonna be hunting us. Come on.

28:58.182 --> 28:59.628
MAGNUM: Those aren't my men.

28:59.629 --> 29:01.040
Where'd their backup come from?

29:01.064 --> 29:02.141
Till probably called 'em in

29:02.165 --> 29:03.476
to attack your compound.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.102
So they can probably
guess where we're headed.

29:05.126 --> 29:08.247
Yeah. Where's the next closest town?

29:08.271 --> 29:11.072
It's in the other direction,
and it's twice as far.

29:12.108 --> 29:13.908
Got to get moving, come on.

29:26.322 --> 29:30.736
I guess someone forgot
to unload this one.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.872
- You think we should toss it?
- What, are you crazy?!

29:32.896 --> 29:34.807
They'll throw you out
of the helicopter for that!

29:34.831 --> 29:37.176
Okay, relax. I'll put it back.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.833
Just stow it somewhere safe.

29:40.637 --> 29:43.304
We're approaching the compound.

30:00.657 --> 30:02.568
High-caliber rounds.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.837
Looks like they were
overwhelmed with firepower.

30:04.861 --> 30:07.339
Whoever did this was not messing around.

30:07.363 --> 30:08.741
Anything?

30:08.765 --> 30:11.844
No sign of Magnum, but
Rick found a few more bodies.

30:12.502 --> 30:14.480
HIGGINS: Well, this is interesting.

30:14.963 --> 30:16.882
- You got something?
- Hmm.

30:16.906 --> 30:19.452
Tire tracks, petrol on the ground.

30:19.476 --> 30:21.821
Someone left in a hurry
with a leaky tank.

30:21.845 --> 30:24.457
Probably the result of gunfire.

30:24.481 --> 30:26.792
They tried really hard
to stop whoever it was.

30:26.816 --> 30:27.960
You thinking Magnum?

30:27.984 --> 30:30.029
Something tells me he got away,

30:30.053 --> 30:32.053
and now he's somewhere out there.

30:35.942 --> 30:38.137
I just realized
I have no idea who you are

30:38.161 --> 30:39.538
or why you're doing this.

30:39.562 --> 30:42.441
You could've just left me
behind, and you didn't. Why?

30:42.465 --> 30:44.743
It wasn't the mission, that's why.

30:44.767 --> 30:47.783
You say you were set up.
There's no more mission.

30:47.807 --> 30:49.596
I'm not in the habit of
leaving people behind.

30:49.620 --> 30:51.383
You must be a soldier.

30:51.407 --> 30:53.251
I was a sailor.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.321
And now?

30:55.345 --> 30:56.772
(SHUSHES)

30:56.797 --> 30:58.157
What?

30:58.181 --> 31:00.181
- (WHIRRING)
- You hear that?

31:01.130 --> 31:03.130
It's a drone. Get under the trees!

31:16.766 --> 31:18.277
(CHIRPING)

31:18.301 --> 31:19.901
(HOOTING)

31:39.956 --> 31:41.400
Got him!

31:41.424 --> 31:42.935
(GUN CLICKS)

31:42.959 --> 31:44.766
- Where's Hayek?
- I lost him.

31:44.790 --> 31:46.705
Tends to happen when
you're running for your life.

31:46.729 --> 31:48.274
You want to play games?

31:48.298 --> 31:49.742
Why not? That's what you've been doing

31:49.766 --> 31:51.226
for whoever you're working for.

31:52.382 --> 31:54.382
He works for me.

32:01.924 --> 32:03.523
Curtis.

32:04.473 --> 32:07.574
You can call me... Ivan.

32:10.687 --> 32:13.165
You're the one who sent
the mercs to Robin's Nest.

32:13.189 --> 32:15.634
- Why?
- I needed you for the mission.

32:15.658 --> 32:18.971
You're the only man alive who
could ever get close to Hayek.

32:18.995 --> 32:21.440
The only one who could get me access.

32:21.464 --> 32:24.410
That's why you wanted the
identity of the White Knight.

32:24.434 --> 32:27.763
One of the books is how I
infiltrated Hayek in Afghanistan.

32:28.304 --> 32:30.282
I couldn't have pulled
it off without you.

32:30.306 --> 32:31.417
(CHUCKLES)

32:31.441 --> 32:32.814
Well, I'm glad I could be of help.

32:32.838 --> 32:35.154
No, no, you exceeded expectations.

32:35.178 --> 32:36.689
Even figured us out.

32:36.713 --> 32:37.957
And I can't say I'm surprised,

32:37.981 --> 32:40.426
you being a detective and all.

32:40.450 --> 32:41.927
Tell me how you did it.

32:42.444 --> 32:45.397
Well, once I found out
Hayek was playing for Team USA,

32:45.421 --> 32:47.333
I figured you guys probably weren't.

32:47.357 --> 32:50.169
I mean, why would we go after
one of own informants?

32:50.193 --> 32:52.504
So you tested our cover stories.

32:52.528 --> 32:56.475
There was no Neil Diamond
fiasco, was there?

32:56.499 --> 32:57.834
No.

32:58.401 --> 33:00.779
I suppose there's no
Sally's Cheesesteaks either?

33:00.803 --> 33:02.481
No, but there is
a Charley's Cheesesteaks,

33:02.505 --> 33:04.617
and the food and service
are actually pretty great.

33:04.641 --> 33:06.118
You got to try the craft beers.

33:06.142 --> 33:08.053
I'll check it out sometime.

33:08.077 --> 33:09.521
What's your beef with Hayek?

33:09.545 --> 33:10.723
And don't tell me you can't say,

33:10.747 --> 33:12.725
because I've told you
pretty much everything.

33:12.749 --> 33:14.059
Just wouldn't be fair.

33:14.083 --> 33:16.228
I need to know what he told the FBI

33:16.252 --> 33:17.963
'cause it could compromise

33:17.987 --> 33:21.033
a significant part of my operations.

33:21.057 --> 33:22.368
Okay. Go on.

33:22.392 --> 33:24.570
I'll leave it at that for now.

33:24.594 --> 33:27.706
But I do admire your attempt to stall.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.241
So,

33:29.732 --> 33:31.176
where's Hayek?

33:32.050 --> 33:33.512
Look, I don't know.

33:33.536 --> 33:35.514
He probably died in the blast.

33:35.538 --> 33:36.782
No, he didn't.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.851
I made sure that blast
wasn't a direct hit

33:38.875 --> 33:40.519
because I need him alive.

33:40.543 --> 33:42.087
Now, I'm guessing you
hid him somewhere here.

33:42.111 --> 33:44.089
So why don't you tell us where he is,

33:44.113 --> 33:45.724
save yourself a lot of pain.

33:45.748 --> 33:47.660
One of your mercs tortured my friend

33:47.684 --> 33:49.678
and scared the hell out of another one.

33:50.470 --> 33:51.864
I'm not gonna help you.

33:51.888 --> 33:53.598
Yes, you will.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.001
Eventually.

33:56.025 --> 33:57.811
In fact,

33:59.128 --> 34:01.974
he'll hurt you to the point
where you're begging me

34:01.998 --> 34:03.497
to kill you.

34:09.237 --> 34:10.949
He's all yours.

to the "losing fingers

34:35.054 --> 34:36.866

34:37.350 --> 34:39.069
Now,

34:39.092 --> 34:40.303
where is he?
