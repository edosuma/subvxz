01:17.520 --> 01:19.636
Every good spy needs a cover.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.032
Be a journalist, they said.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.872
You're good with words.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.759
You'll be safe.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.593
Where is the girl, Mr. Soames?

01:39.920 --> 01:40.830
Where is the girl?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.236
This way!

01:57.160 --> 01:58.195
Please have a seat.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.157
I'd like to call the American Consulate and
tell them where I am.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.359
They've already been informed.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.478
Someone's coming to pick you up.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.199
That might be them.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.472
The last time we spoke...

02:36.640 --> 02:39.518
...I didn't realize how fond
of Mrs. Lan-Ting you were.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.833
If I'd known, I'd have been more careful
what I said.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.156
Both the Lan-Tings are friends of mine.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.596
But only one of them accompanied you
to your hotel last night.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.669
Yeah.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.793
She came to tell me she was still in love
with her husband.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.233
I'd be careful.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.833
It isn't in some people's nature
to love us back.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.759
Where is she...

03:13.800 --> 03:15.153
...Mr. Soames?

03:16.280 --> 03:17.395
I don't know.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.113
I have no idea.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.515
Where is she?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.797
A friend of mine told me...

03:41.880 --> 03:44.314
...Shanghai was the Paris of the Orient.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.713
Due to an international treaty...

03:45.760 --> 03:48.718
...every nationality under the sun lived
within her borders...

03:48.960 --> 03:53.078
..Chinese and English, French, Japanese, American.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.589
My friend said you could travel the world
in an afternoon...

03:55.640 --> 03:58.598
...and never leave the confines of Shanghai's
international settlement.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.430
It seems like Shanghai's gonna be a bit of a comedown
for you after Berlin,

04:04.480 --> 04:05.799
Mr. Soames.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.239
Not from what I hear, sir.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.436
I meant as a journalist, not a bachelor.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.040
Well, if Japan doesn't withdraw from China soon...

04:12.040 --> 04:14.349
...RooseveIt's threatened to get his hands dirty.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.675
So I'm sure there'll be plenty for me to write about.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.355
Well. And you think it's a good idea for your country
to join the war?

04:19.440 --> 04:20.918
Not if it means fighting you Germans.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.393
You seem to be pretty good at it.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.758
I will go get the car.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.398
Did you have to provoke him?

04:30.760 --> 04:32.398
I thought you said he was a diplomat.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.074
No, I said he was attached to the consulate.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.508
He's an engineer.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.076
Stop him! He's with the resistance!

05:06.240 --> 05:07.514
Welcome to Shanghai.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.029
Leni, komm!

05:12.760 --> 05:15.149
Shanghai was about the only place left in China

05:15.200 --> 05:16.792
the Japanese hadn't taken over.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.468
Everybody knew

05:19.520 --> 05:21.511
it was only a matter of time before they
swallowed it whole.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.470
Officially the guerilla war between the Chinese
and the Japanese

05:24.520 --> 05:26.670
was none of our business.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.036
So, like a good American,

05:30.080 --> 05:31.798
I kept my head down and remained neutral.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.280
Shanghai was divided up into sectors.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.791
Drink in the British zone,

06:06.880 --> 06:08.632
eat in the French zone...

06:08.760 --> 06:10.716
...spy in the German zone...

06:10.800 --> 06:12.870
...but stay the hell away from the Japanese.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.280
Naval lntelligence had sent me to Shanghai

06:22.280 --> 06:24.430
to help out an agent who was in trouble.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.871
He was my oldest and best friend.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.113
His name was Conner.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.276
I'm gonna get you out tonight.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.758
The storm had blown over by the time
I got to the casino.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.275
In Shanghai, things change pretty fast.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.233
The routine with Conner was always the same.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.157
We'd meet in the biggest casino in town.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.874
The loser would buy dinner.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.872
Chip request for the lady.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.598
Chip request for the lady.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.915
Follow by 500

08:59.160 --> 09:01.196
That is 550.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.475
I'm Out

09:05.880 --> 09:08.440
You're working pretty hard to bully me out
of my 50.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.269
What did you say?

09:10.480 --> 09:12.869
Oh, I said, I'll see your 500...

09:13.000 --> 09:15.150
...and raise you whatever I have left.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.311
300 and something.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.070
Why don't you keep your something
for your taxi home?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.718
It's a short walk to my hotel.

09:22.000 --> 09:22.955
Three nines.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.636
Three queens for the lady.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.477
A very appropriate hand.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.953
A very appropriate hand.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.396
You must have brought me luck.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.119
No second chance?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.309
Not tonight.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.989
Deal me out, boys.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.192
Leave him.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.348
You all right, sir?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.389
Lieutenant Collins. Captain Astor sent me.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.557
So we finally got you out of Berlin.

11:22.880 --> 11:23.835
How was your trip?

11:23.960 --> 11:26.997
Glorious. Except half the Gestapo was
on the ship with me.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.758
Come on in. Let me get you a drink.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.394
Where the hell is Conner?

11:30.720 --> 11:32.517
He was supposed to meet me at the casino.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.560
He was found earlier in the Japanese sector.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.234
I guess he was on his way to meet you.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.320
You know, this whole country has its head buried
in the sand.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.400
The Germans are getting ready to march in Europe...

12:04.400 --> 12:07.312
...and all we care about is whether or not the
Yankees beat the Giants.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.031
I mean, what have we done with our lives?

12:12.760 --> 12:15.149
I called Naval headquarters this morning.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.790
I volunteered us both for lntelligence.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.638
Conner and I had joined the Navy

12:32.680 --> 12:35.035
Iike our fathers and grandfathers before us.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.717
Our lives were set.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.078
Birth, school, Yale, war.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.593
The great American tradition.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.590
He was investigating a local gang lord called
Anthony Lan-Ting.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.198
He's the boss of the Shanghai Triad.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.639
He has a deal with the Japanese.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.911
They leave him alone...

13:04.080 --> 13:06.958
...and whenever the Japanese need any dirty work
done they go to him.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.512
I'd like to read all of Conner's reports.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.471
He hadn't briefed us in a month.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.158
That's why I sent for you.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.079
I was under a lot of pressure to have him reassigned.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.149
Why?

13:20.360 --> 13:22.590
Because the situation here

13:22.720 --> 13:24.472
isn't just black and white.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.158
You got the Chinese fighting the Japanese.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.351
Us, we're caught somewhere in the middle.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.595
Now the truth is,

13:30.640 --> 13:32.870
the Japanese want to walk into our zone...

13:33.200 --> 13:34.713
...there's nothing we can do about it.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.228
So sometimes,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.789
our only option is just to sit back and
not rock the boat.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.911
And that wasn't Conner's style.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.160
Any informers?

13:47.160 --> 13:47.672
Yeah.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.756
He's got a contact at the Japanese consulate...

13:49.800 --> 13:50.949
...a diplomat called Kita.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.758
We've already spoken to him.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.671
I'd like to speak to him myself.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.792
And I'll need an introduction to Lan-Ting.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.034
Apart from his own people,

13:58.080 --> 14:00.071
he only mixes with the Germans and the Japanese.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.712
I know plenty of Germans.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.438
When do I start at the Herald?

14:05.640 --> 14:08.598
In Berlin, I played the part of a journalist
with Nazi sympathies...

14:09.520 --> 14:11.192
...and I was doing it again at the Shanghai Herald.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.555
Mr. Soames was the Washington Post's correspondent

14:16.600 --> 14:19.672
in Berlin before he joined us.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.314
I'm sure most of you are already familiar
with his reputation.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.155
Those who aren't

14:25.200 --> 14:27.668
will have a chance to find out for themselves
in good time.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.875
Right. Back to work.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.549
How's it going, boys?

14:44.520 --> 14:45.873
Paul Soames, Shanghai Herald.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.150
Yeah, we set the meet with Conner's Japanese contact, Kita.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.110
You got a pen?

14:49.160 --> 14:50.036
Where is it?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.551
A place called the Bamboo Tea House in the Japanese district.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.033
He meets his girlfriend there...

14:55.320 --> 14:57.356
...everyday at 3:00 pm.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.908
At all clear,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.389
he will open a book on the porch.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.994
Paul, listen to me.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.071
You'll be in the heart of the Japanese sector.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.713
You be careful over there.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.351
Tell us what you know about the resistance

15:56.000 --> 15:57.319
Take him...

15:59.320 --> 16:00.514
...in for questioning!

16:17.440 --> 16:18.316
Papers.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.430
Papers.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.755
Move.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.159
Move. You're under arrest.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.634
"No threat to American interests"?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.109
Sir?

16:44.280 --> 16:45.838
You probably know this already, Mr. Soames...

16:45.920 --> 16:48.559
...but when the owners of this newspaper told me
to hire you,

16:48.680 --> 16:50.159
I threatened to resign.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.709
The only reason I didn't

16:52.840 --> 16:54.910
was because I wanted to meet you face to face...

16:54.960 --> 16:57.474
...and see if you really believe this crap you write.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.555
My office!

16:59.720 --> 17:01.711
"Germany and Japan are no more our enemies

17:01.760 --> 17:03.716
than Britain and Russia are our friends.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.074
In a war of this magnitude

17:05.119 --> 17:08.271
our only concern should be for ourselves."

17:09.520 --> 17:10.714
The Japanese foreign minister

17:10.760 --> 17:11.795
met with the German foreign minister yesterday...

17:11.839 --> 17:13.114
...and one of the subjects they discussed

17:13.160 --> 17:14.309
was whether my Jewish wife...

17:14.359 --> 17:16.680
...should wear a yellow star on her jacket

17:16.680 --> 17:18.989
and be herded into a Shanghai ghetto...

17:19.079 --> 17:21.469
...along with the rest of her kind.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.869
Now I think that should be a concern...

17:24.000 --> 17:27.037
...for every civilized country in the world, even America.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.720
I'm not a Nazi, if that's your implication, Mr. Sanger.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.079
I've lived in Germany far too long

17:31.120 --> 17:33.634
to have any illusions about what kind of people they are.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.357
Now you can fire me, you can censor me--

17:37.480 --> 17:39.311
I have no intention of firing you.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.871
Write something that doesn't make my stomach
turn and I'll print it...

17:42.960 --> 17:45.554
...otherwise you can type your fingers raw for all I care.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.271
Will that be all, sir?

17:46.320 --> 17:47.435
Yeah, get out.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.829
Oh, and this came for you.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.474
At least your Nazi friends are impressed.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.315
Mrs. Mueller, thank you so much for the invitation.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.039
It's lovely to see you, Mr. Soames.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.752
My pleasure. Mr. Mueller.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.995
Mr. Soames.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.356
A party at the German embassy

18:16.400 --> 18:17.549
could make one night feel like a thousand years.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.113
Laughing at all their jokes

18:19.240 --> 18:22.755
was like eating breakfast from the gutter.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.235
The way I see it, for America to join the war...

18:25.320 --> 18:27.072
...would be like a man who's never

18:27.120 --> 18:29.509
been in a relationship interfering in a 50 year marriage.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.993
Thank you for a wonderful party, Your Excellency.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.116
I'm glad you're enjoying it, Mr. Lan-Ting.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.398
You know everyone here, don't you?

18:40.120 --> 18:41.235
Paul Soames.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.472
Anthony Lan-Ting.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.556
Gentlemen, excuse me.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.033
These affairs had quite a guest list.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.397
Nazis, Japanese imperialists, the Triads, Kempeitai.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.074
They were all connected.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.312
Any of them could have killed Conner.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.030
I had to get in between them.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.668
It was like being a worm,

19:06.720 --> 19:09.473
working your way into a rotten apple.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.398
Please tell me you're not politicians or diplomats.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.993
If you are a politician or a diplomat,

19:14.040 --> 19:15.439
it doesn't matter how beautiful or charming you are...

19:15.480 --> 19:16.913
...I just cannot talk to you,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.070
I couldn't bear it.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.998
I'm afraid they can't speak a word of English,
Mr. Soames.

19:22.080 --> 19:22.910
No?

19:22.960 --> 19:24.552
Let me introduce you properly.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.074
These are my cousins Shin Shin and Lili.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.074
And this is my friend Captain Tanaka...

19:31.280 --> 19:33.669
...a politician and a diplomat, I'm afraid.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.518
Captain, it's a pleasure to meet you.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.232
I hope I didn't offend you, sir.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.633
If there's anything else you'd like to ask the girls...

19:40.720 --> 19:42.153
...I'd be happy to translate.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.713
Well, now that I know you're related to them,

19:43.760 --> 19:45.273
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

19:46.040 --> 19:46.950
Excuse me.

19:47.000 --> 19:47.876
Captain.

19:50.800 --> 19:55.316
Japan is as deserving of an empire in the East...

19:55.640 --> 19:58.438
...as Germany is of an empire in the West.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.509
So...

20:03.640 --> 20:05.517
...how does a writer for the Shanghai Herald

20:05.560 --> 20:07.676
get asked to the German Consulate?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.068
Some friends invited me.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.796
Well, the truth is I'm only friends

20:12.840 --> 20:14.831
with the lonely-looking fraulein in the black dress.

20:14.880 --> 20:15.869
Oh, I see.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.998
A toast to the Emperor...

20:21.440 --> 20:22.668
..and the Fuhrer!

20:23.760 --> 20:25.318
Honorable men all.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.668
May they rot in hell.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.315
And now, some music.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.270
Anna!

20:38.480 --> 20:39.754
I'm sorry I'm late.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.353
My appointments ran late.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.073
That's okay.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.111
Darling, this is my friend, Paul Soames.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.359
My wife Anna.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.394
How do you do?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.919
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.394
What did you decide?

20:57.640 --> 21:00.108
I thought we'd take them to the fashion show
at the Casino.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.550
So...

21:04.200 --> 21:05.838
...how do you know my husband?

21:06.240 --> 21:07.673
Actually we just met.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.110
Oh, I thought you were old friends.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.238
It certainly feels that way.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.639
Shall I get you something to drink?

21:14.880 --> 21:17.269
I'd like to dance before I do anything else.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.998
Will you dance with me, darling?

21:19.360 --> 21:21.510
You should ask Mr. Soames.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.308
Mr. Soames?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.199
I'd be delighted.

21:27.080 --> 21:27.990
Thank you, Anthony.

21:28.040 --> 21:28.916
You're welcome.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.629
My husband doesn't always trust people
he's just met.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.070
How did you charm him so quickly?

21:45.160 --> 21:46.120
He and his cousins

21:46.120 --> 21:48.588
just seemed like the most interesting
people here tonight.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.199
They're not his cousins.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.196
No?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.798
They're his mistresses.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.551
Anthony doesn't know I gamble.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.789
He'd be very upset if he found out.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.672
I have no intention of telling him.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.352
Good. Thank you.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.390
I like secrets. I collect them.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.714
Fascinating.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.550
Why were you following me at the casino?

22:16.080 --> 22:17.911
I had no idea you were married.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.751
And who was your friend with the cigarette case?

22:22.600 --> 22:24.113
A question for a question.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.274
Well, it's like poker.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.151
You have to pay to see my hand.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.748
What game are we playing, Mr. Soames?

22:31.560 --> 22:32.470
Paul.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.278
Leni.I thought you'd left.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.395
No, no, no.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.748
Leni Mueller, this is Mrs. Anthony Lan-Ting.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.115
How do you do?

22:43.120 --> 22:44.951
I should get back to my husband.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.831
Of course. Thank you for the dance.

22:46.880 --> 22:47.869
Not at all.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.838
She doesn't look very married.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.149
Neither do you.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.428
Drop me off at the harbor.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.996
Kita was Conner's only known contact.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.475
I figured if Conner trusted him,
I probably could too.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.597
So I found us a quiet place to talk.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.314
What do you want to tell me?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.149
I was helping Conner.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.073
In exchange he promised me
an American passport.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.431
I was supposed to get it a year ago.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.591
He said he would help me.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.914
Uh-huh. Well, we're here to help.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.870
Keep talking.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.597
Conner called me a few days before he died.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.314
He needed a checkpoint pass for a friend.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.112
His friend was Japanese.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.990
He was trying to smuggle her out of Shanghai.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.077
He told me not to tell anyone.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.752
After he was killed I was scared

23:46.800 --> 23:48.552
you'd think I set him up.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.838
What'd you do with the pass?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.276
I took it to the apartment in Chapei like he said.

23:53.440 --> 23:54.350
What apartment?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.231
Conner lived in the lnternational Settlement.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.232
He gave me an address in Chapei.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.237
When I went, there was nobody there.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.436
I can prove it. I still have the pass.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.679
This was Conner's girlfriend.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.319
Her name is Sumiko.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.112
I can show you where the apartment is.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.354
So all Conner wanted was a checkpoint pass?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.353
Was he working on anything else?

24:19.720 --> 24:21.995
Just routine naval intelligence.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.951
He had me report on the Emperor's East China Fleet.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.631
He never told me what the information was for

24:28.720 --> 24:30.039
and I never asked.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.595
Just ask them if they ever saw him
with a young woman.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.354
According to the neighbors,

24:44.440 --> 24:47.477
the girl disappeared the night Conner was killed.
She set him up.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.713
Must have rented another room.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.034
An attic or a basement.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.877
Anywhere he could have used as a darkroom.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.311
So why didn't the girl hand these over
when she turned him in?

25:39.800 --> 25:42.758
Maybe Conner still had enough sense not
to tell her everything.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.470
I saw this man

25:45.520 --> 25:47.431
with Lan-Ting at the German Consulate.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.230
His name's Tanaka.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.794
He's head of Japanese lntelligence for Shanghai.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.793
These are Navy and Air Corps officers here.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.629
We should find out who the other men are in that picture.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.273
Tanaka's saluting them, they've gotta be ranking officers.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.113
That's Lan-Ting's wife.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.033
Her father was a respected politician till
the Japanese took him out.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.479
They would have killed her too

26:10.040 --> 26:12.110
but her family arranged for her to marry Lan-Ting.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.798
He protects her.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.478
Anna was everywhere...

26:32.960 --> 26:34.791
...in the city...

26:35.880 --> 26:38.440
...but she always seemed to be hiding something.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.079
So I did what you do with a puzzle.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.151
I stared at it until it made sense.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.837
I have to see what that Japanese bastard wants

27:16.880 --> 27:18.199
No, not now!

27:19.440 --> 27:20.919
This will just take a minute.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.955
I'll be right back.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.072
Anthony, get down! Get down!

27:48.160 --> 27:49.229
Anthony!

28:00.600 --> 28:01.794
Anthony!

28:30.960 --> 28:32.871
Paul, come in.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.635
You're lucky the bastards couldn't shoot straight.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.552
Even luckier that you were there.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.952
Who do I have to thank for that?

28:41.080 --> 28:43.036
The fraulein I told you about last week.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.113
I was supposed to meet her at the fashion show
and she stood me up.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.913
Perhaps her husband sent those gunmen after you.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.599
Did you found out who they were?

28:53.600 --> 28:54.635
I will.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.433
Captain, please come in.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.989
Why don't you show Mr. Soames around the house

29:15.040 --> 29:16.632
until we're ready for dinner?

29:35.280 --> 29:36.349
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.070
Your hand. Here.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.270
Thank you.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.231
Did you know any of the men who died today?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.079
They were Japanese.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.948
I meant the others.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.751
I recognized your friends from the casino.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.558
Why didn't you tell Anthony?

30:05.720 --> 30:07.631
I wasn't quite sure what to tell him.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.199
Does Anthony know you're working for the resistance?

30:14.520 --> 30:16.750
I'd never do anything to hurt him.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.195
Your friends didn't seem quite so discriminating.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.555
They murdered several men in cold blood.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.954
Did you know one of the gunmen survived?

30:35.480 --> 30:37.630
What will you do if he talks?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.478
Maybe I can help you.

30:41.480 --> 30:45.029
Every time you've come to me for help

30:45.160 --> 30:47.958
I've done what you asked.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.516
I'm doing everything I can to find her.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.556
You said you could handle this.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.713
You walk into my house

30:56.760 --> 30:59.593
and give me orders in front of my own men?

31:26.480 --> 31:27.959
What does Tanaka want from you?

31:28.960 --> 31:31.633
He thinks the resistance is close to me.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.713
How could he think that?

31:33.840 --> 31:35.671
Tanaka has one of the gunmen

31:35.960 --> 31:37.678
and is beating him for information.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.517
Who knows what lies he is saying?

31:41.840 --> 31:44.832
I give Tanaka everything

31:44.880 --> 31:46.233
and he humiliates me in return.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.190
Forgive us for speaking Chinese.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.393
How do you like the food?

31:56.600 --> 31:57.715
It's sensational.

31:58.600 --> 32:02.832
In fact, it reminds me...just how bad the food
is at the Casanova.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.989
The Casanova?

32:04.040 --> 32:07.271
That's my local restaurant. I go there for the waiters.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.238
I dine alone each night,

32:09.440 --> 32:11.431
and yet they insist on setting two places.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.991
I'm supposed to meet a friend at the Cathay later.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.391
I can give you a lift back into town.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.518
That'd be very kind. Thank you.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.631
You can't go into town tonight, darling.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.711
It's too dangerous after what happened.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.678
I don't know how to reach her.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.759
I'm happy to pass a message to her if you like,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.276
It's no problem at all, the Cathay's on my way.

32:33.800 --> 32:34.869
I can stop in.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.799
I hope I can see you soon.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.353
I look forward to that, Anthony.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.317
Thank you for saving his life.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.354
Chip request.

33:51.880 --> 33:52.835
Where are we going?

33:52.880 --> 33:53.949
Hurry! We're getting out of here.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.789
Please don't kill me.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.990
Drive!

33:59.080 --> 34:00.513
The Japanese will be here soon!

34:00.640 --> 34:04.428
It seemed Anna wasn't worried about the Japanese
coming after her.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.155
She was worried they'd find whoever was
hiding under that hood.

34:23.719 --> 34:27.030
She better be here as you say!

34:27.639 --> 34:29.835
This is the place. She's here!

34:29.880 --> 34:32.030
We don't have time for games!

34:32.159 --> 34:34.116
I don't understand.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.835
They must have moved her! Captain!

34:36.920 --> 34:39.353
She was here. I swear! Captain! Please believe me.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.908
Please, Captain!

34:43.440 --> 34:46.318
I'll find her for you.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.595
I trust your message was delivered.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.438
I'm grateful for what you did.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.360
Does that entitle me to a few more answers?

35:12.520 --> 35:13.396
No.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.316
I've been doing some homework on you.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.911
I read your stories about the war in Europe.

35:23.320 --> 35:24.753
You write well.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.070
Thank you.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.156
But you don't seem to believe in much.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.753
The story you should be writing

35:33.880 --> 35:36.030
is what the Japanese are doing in Shanghai.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.632
The Japanese murdered thousands
of people in Nanjing.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.678
And soon, they'll do the same thing here.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.796
That's why we are fighting.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.513
You find this amusing?

35:51.080 --> 35:53.753
No, no. It's just that you just remind me
of a friend of mine.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.755
In what way?

35:56.440 --> 35:57.759
The way you argue.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.759
He was a force of nature.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.919
He'd come at you from all sides
until you surrendered.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.873
So I should be writing about Captain Tanaka?

36:10.480 --> 36:13.278
He usually has a hand in everything
that happens in Shanghai.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.513
Was he head of Shanghai lntelligence
when your father was killed?

36:23.160 --> 36:24.878
I did a little homework of my own.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.992
Sounds like he was a remarkable man.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.470
It must have taken a lot of courage

36:30.520 --> 36:33.592
to speak out against Japanese atrocities in Nanjing.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.834
He just cared deeply about this country.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.830
Anthony loves American jazz.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.239
Are you still in love with him?

37:11.320 --> 37:13.276
I wouldn't be with him if I wasn't.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.314
I only ask because you seem to be
on your own a lot.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.515
I'll take this.

37:45.640 --> 37:46.311
Our informants haven't found

37:46.360 --> 37:48.920
any information on the Japanese girl
who betrayed Conner.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.432
What about the men saluting Tanaka?

37:51.720 --> 37:54.757
Well, they're officers from the aircraft carrier Kaga.

37:54.920 --> 37:55.796
The Kaga?

37:55.840 --> 37:57.319
We checked it out.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.952
They were in Shanghai last month for R&R.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.353
There's nothing secret about it.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.434
Look, Tanaka is in charge of security
for visiting personnel.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.278
He's probably just telling them what bars
they can and can't go to.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.153
Conner wouldn't have taken pictures
of it if it wasn't important.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.999
He was interested in Tanaka for a reason.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.992
Paul, I know you don't want to hear this,

38:17.240 --> 38:20.437
But this profession catches up with all of us.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.311
Maybe Conner made the wrong call.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.191
He didn't make mistakes like this, Richard.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.992
You know, the first article I ever wrote

38:29.040 --> 38:30.632
for the Herald was about your mother.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.276
The Garbo of Shanghai, I called her.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.754
Well, perhaps I'll have to dream up
a name for you, too.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.354
Just finishing up some work back here, sir.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.633
Why don't you wait in my office?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.239
She's a friend of the family.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.838
I'm helping her with her passport application.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.473
I understand. I'll just finish up.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.759
So if you'll just-- Yes.

38:57.560 --> 38:58.629
Lock up when you go.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.918
I needed to see Shanghai through Conner's eyes.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.194
The only port in the world

39:05.240 --> 39:08.516
that would take in 20,000 Jews on the run from Hitler...

39:08.800 --> 39:11.155
...as the Japanese and the Chinese were
engaged in street warfare.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.668
Dead bodies piled up.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.109
Westerners walked over them and
went about their business.

39:16.360 --> 39:20.069
To survive Shanghai, you needed to
understand her contradictions.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.590
I showed these to the ambassador.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.158
He doesn't think they warrant any form of protest.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.873
"Having analyzed these photographs

39:28.920 --> 39:30.797
I conclude that the SS methods...

39:30.880 --> 39:33.678
...for pacifying an occupied country
are exceedingly simple.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.198
Families are picked at random...

39:36.240 --> 39:37.389
...taken to a place of execution

39:37.440 --> 39:39.431
and then forced to dig their own graves.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.118
And if they happen to be Jewish...

39:41.200 --> 39:44.033
...then the children are shot in front
of their parents first."

39:44.840 --> 39:46.432
You gonna beat the German army on your own?

39:46.480 --> 39:48.994
Forget the Germans. We've already lost in Europe.

39:49.040 --> 39:49.677
No, I'm talking about the Far East.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.869
The Far East, that's where the next battleground is.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.319
Now, if we wanna beat them

39:52.360 --> 39:54.874
We're gonna have to sink to their level.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.914
Do whatever's necessary and if our superiors don't like it,

39:57.960 --> 39:59.393
then they don't have to know.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.034
These sons of bitches have opened my eyes.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.789
There's a lady to see you, sir, in the lobby.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.558
Why didn't Karl take you with him?

40:17.680 --> 40:19.193
What would I do in Tokyo?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.560
Drink tea with the wives,

40:20.560 --> 40:22.516
try to understand their English?

40:22.640 --> 40:23.993
I wish you'd told me you were coming.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.359
I would have cancelled my dinner plans.

40:26.680 --> 40:27.635
Thank you.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.675
What's this?

40:30.880 --> 40:32.472
It's not what you think it is.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.000
Of course it is.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.433
No.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.039
I've put Karl through hell these past weeks.

40:39.080 --> 40:41.913
Men always seem to notice when you're not in love
with them any more.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.791
And he's been so preoccupied with his work.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.796
A bad day at the office doesn't justify that.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.753
It wasn't a bad day.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.957
We've had the Japanese stay at our house ever
since we arrived.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.678
They've been drinking our champagne, eating our caviar

40:53.720 --> 40:55.233
and no word of thanks.

40:55.840 --> 40:57.512
Why doesn't Karl say something?

40:59.440 --> 41:00.759
He has to be nice to them.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.158
Our navy sold them something that doesn't work...

41:05.720 --> 41:07.199
...and now he has to fix it.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.790
I didn't realize he was a naval engineer.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.637
Can we please stop talking about him?

41:18.280 --> 41:19.633
What are you thinking?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.308
I'm thinking...

41:23.000 --> 41:24.638
...about where to take you for dinner.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.393
I thought you had plans.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.799
Well, something came up.

41:59.320 --> 42:00.230
It's them!

42:08.480 --> 42:09.356
Drive on.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.358
Fireworks.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.071
There's this lovely little bar I know on the Rue Lafayette.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.638
I thought we'd go there for a nightcap...

42:27.080 --> 42:28.513
...and then back to your place.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.628
What?

42:31.720 --> 42:33.080
I have staff.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.877
Smuggle me past your staff.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.718
Hello, Mr. Soames.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.836
Mrs. Lan-Ting. How are you?

42:43.280 --> 42:44.633
Very well, thank you.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.228
You remember Mrs. Mueller.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.714
Yes, of course.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.152
Would you like to join us? Would you like to sit down?

42:51.280 --> 42:52.429
I'm meeting some friends.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.074
Is Anthony with you?

42:55.160 --> 42:56.036
Not tonight.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.635
My husband and I are having a party next week.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.550
We'd love to see you if you're free.

43:01.760 --> 43:02.875
My pleasure.

43:03.000 --> 43:03.910
Good.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.720
"Type 91 torpedoes transferred
to the aircraft carrier Kaga...

44:42.720 --> 44:45.518
...October 28th, 1941, Shanghai."

45:25.200 --> 45:26.872
I don't even know what this tells us.

45:27.000 --> 45:27.955
This tells us the officers of the Kaga

45:28.000 --> 45:29.149
didn't come to Shanghai for the night life.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.633
Conner worked it all out.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.789
Look at the date.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.833
The torpedoes were delivered two days after Conner
took those photos.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.518
The Germans and the Japanese are allies.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.039
They sell each other weapons all the time.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.798
These are not ordinary weapon.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.831
You got 800 kilogram torpedoes.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.072
You've got naval engineers on both sides

45:49.120 --> 45:50.758
making adjustments to maximize the accuracy.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.036
Let's suppose that he stumbled on an arms deal.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.433
What would you like me to do?

45:54.560 --> 45:55.834
Find out where the Kaga is.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.228
I already did.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.233
She's been with the East China fleet the whole time.

45:59.280 --> 46:02.078
She hasn't moved in months.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.917
Look, find out who killed him...

46:05.360 --> 46:07.635
...and I will do everything in my power
to make them pay...

46:07.840 --> 46:10.195
...but I can't declare war on Japan over these.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.468
I hope I'm not crashing the party.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.511
I wasn't sure if you'd invited me the other night.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.238
I invited Miss Mueller.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.759
Mrs. Mueller.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.833
Did your friends ever show up?

46:34.920 --> 46:36.956
You think I came to see you?

46:37.240 --> 46:40.391
If I'm to be honest, I stayed up all night
wondering if you did.

46:41.680 --> 46:44.148
I'm wise to your charms, Mr. Soames.

46:45.400 --> 46:48.233
Don't forget I heard you in action with Miss Mueller.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.878
Mrs. Mueller.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.549
Listen, if I say something that offends you,

46:54.600 --> 46:55.953
please just smile and walk way...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.389
...because I would hate to get slapped in front
of all your guests.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.833
Maybe you shouldn't say it.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.839
I wanna see you again.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.557
Are you flirting with my wife now?

47:10.240 --> 47:11.275
Absolutely.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.833
How's your arm?

47:19.000 --> 47:20.558
It's already healed.

47:22.320 --> 47:23.355
I'm glad.

47:25.880 --> 47:26.835
Darling

47:27.520 --> 47:30.159
...will you ask the girls to dance
with our Japanese guests?

47:30.840 --> 47:31.750
Okay.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.189
Let's talk.

47:42.160 --> 47:46.756
A few years ago I'd have cut his throat
for even looking at her.

47:52.240 --> 47:56.313
Anna told me she saw you at the
Casanova Restaurant last Tuesday.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.714
That's right. She did.

47:58.080 --> 48:01.038
She caught me having dinner
with my German friend.

48:04.080 --> 48:07.072
Will you confirm that to Captain Tanaka?

48:08.400 --> 48:09.355
Of course.

48:10.760 --> 48:11.715
Thank you.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.475
Is everything all right?

48:19.040 --> 48:21.998
Japanese diplomats were assassinated
that night.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.395
Captain Tanaka thinks

48:23.440 --> 48:26.637
someone close to me told the resistance
where to find them.

48:27.040 --> 48:30.476
He wants me to account for the movements
of all my men.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.318
Surely not your wife?

48:32.480 --> 48:33.833
My wife,

48:34.400 --> 48:35.992
my friends...

48:36.400 --> 48:37.958
...myself.

49:05.840 --> 49:06.875
Mrs--

49:09.280 --> 49:10.349
Excuse me, Captain.

49:10.400 --> 49:12.834
You're not enjoying the party, Mr. Soames?

49:14.600 --> 49:16.431
You look like you're hiding out as well.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.871
I'm too old to make a fool of myself
on the dance floor.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.396
You're welcome to come in and hide with me.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.197
We will have our own drinks.

49:27.280 --> 49:28.235
Thank you.

49:33.720 --> 49:36.280
I'm sorry. I was looking for my husband.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.279
He's in the living room, I believe.

49:47.920 --> 49:52.152
I've never seen so many men make fools
of themselves over somebody.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.320
She talks to ten of them at the same time...

49:54.320 --> 49:57.517
...and they all think they're the only one
she's interested in.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.313
That's part of her charm.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.476
You think it's as innocent as that?

50:02.560 --> 50:05.870
Her husband tells me you spent Tuesday night
with her.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.195
No, no, not with her unfortunately.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.470
I just ran into her at the same restaurant,
the Casanova.

50:13.320 --> 50:15.197
Are you married, Mr. Soames?

50:16.480 --> 50:18.198
I was. A long time ago.

50:19.240 --> 50:21.276
My wife ran off with another man

50:21.400 --> 50:23.960
two days before we were due to leave
for Shanghai.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.395
I'm sorry.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.151
Did yours break your heart?

50:28.520 --> 50:29.919
From what I remember.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.273
Women always win in the end.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.552
They forget us more easily.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.591
Mine certainly did that.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.355
To nobody ever making fools of us again.

50:46.440 --> 50:49.591
Do you think it's possible to fall in love
like that again?

50:49.760 --> 50:53.230
Well, I don't think it'll ever be as maddening
as the first time.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.032
I disagree.

50:55.160 --> 50:58.755
I think the second time might be worse
for men like us.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.029
What kind of men are we?

51:00.960 --> 51:02.234
Romantics.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.879
We are so eager to get over the pain
of the first betrayal...

51:06.480 --> 51:09.199
...we'll walk blindly into the next.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.910
You don't remember how long Mrs. Lan-Ting stayed
at the restaurant?

51:17.440 --> 51:20.159
If I can recall, she was there the entire time we were.

51:20.280 --> 51:21.998
About nine to midnight.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.920
The Chinese use these to light their opium candles.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.758
I'm always burning myself.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.959
I think I will have one.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.595
Fireworks.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.634
I told you.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.793
I must check on our guests.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.075
Alright.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.233
You're leaving so soon?

52:27.880 --> 52:29.108
Yeah, think so.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.830
You were talking to Captain Tanaka?

52:33.480 --> 52:35.357
Yes. We were both admiring your skill...

52:35.640 --> 52:38.712
...at convincing every man in the room that he
meant something to you.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.153
Surely that's what every good hostess does?

52:43.320 --> 52:45.675
He seemed to imply there was more to it than that.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.555
In fact, he warned me to stay away from you.

52:49.560 --> 52:50.913
Why would he do that?

52:51.360 --> 52:52.952
He probably thinks

52:53.080 --> 52:55.833
I'm some idiot American who'd be crazy enough
to lie for you.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.270
And are you?

52:59.520 --> 53:01.670
I think we both know the answer to that question.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.918
Thanks for the party.

53:31.240 --> 53:33.959
So what's this article of yours about, Mister...?

53:34.120 --> 53:37.749
Opium addiction amongst the various armed
forces in Shanghai.

53:39.440 --> 53:41.032
Just take a look. Does he come here?

53:45.920 --> 53:47.717
I wouldn't waste your time

53:47.760 --> 53:49.512
writing an expose on your Japanese friend...

53:49.600 --> 53:52.717
...if that's what you're doing. He never
touched the stuff.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.512
He only came here because of his little Geisha girl.

53:54.640 --> 53:56.995
Sumiko, wasn't it, Mikey?

53:57.480 --> 53:59.596
Mikey here used to spy on them all the time.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.560
He even drilled his own little peephole
through their private booth,

54:02.600 --> 54:03.555
didn't you, peepo?

54:04.160 --> 54:06.355
She couldn't get enough of the stuff.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.359
Is that the girl?

54:11.840 --> 54:13.910
When was the last time you saw them here together?

54:14.040 --> 54:15.519
A few weeks ago.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.911
It's nothing like Ralphie told you.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.157
I only peeped on them once or twice.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.310
There was something sad about them.

54:22.600 --> 54:24.989
She'd lie there all doped out of her mind and...

54:25.160 --> 54:28.630
...her Japanese friend would hold her hands,
whispering.

54:28.760 --> 54:29.749
Whispering what?

54:29.920 --> 54:31.558
Whatever came into his head.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.793
How she was his future, his second chance.

54:35.880 --> 54:37.480
Did she ever come in here with an American?

54:37.480 --> 54:39.391
Tall, good-looking, dark hair?

54:39.480 --> 54:43.439
Mikey's the only tall, good-looking American
around here.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.432
I felt like I was following Conner down a dark alley.

54:50.720 --> 54:53.393
Tanaka's mistress must have been off limits
to anybody but a fool.

54:54.120 --> 54:57.669
Conner was a lot of things, but he wasn't a fool.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.359
Conner was investigating a ship called the Kaga
before he died.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.317
I need you to find out everything you can about her.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.317
Also all the intelligence you have on the East China Fleet.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.918
No, they transferred me three times this month.

55:10.720 --> 55:11.948
I think they're testing me.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.195
They're not testing you. Embassies rotate staff
all the time.

55:14.240 --> 55:16.151
It's just precautionary.

55:16.440 --> 55:18.351
Just do this one more thing and we're gonna
get you out.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.518
I need a second passport. That's all I ask.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.548
I'm getting married.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.433
Well, get me a look at the Kaga

55:24.520 --> 55:26.590
and I'll consider it your wedding present.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.031
I'm gonna arrange for the passports myself.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.472
It's the last thing you have to do for us.

55:31.760 --> 55:32.988
You have my word on that.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.315
Over there.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.633
Wait a minute. The Kaga's not there.

56:01.960 --> 56:02.870
Here, take a look.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.113
There are other ships missing.

56:09.160 --> 56:10.036
Which ones

56:10.320 --> 56:13.073
The Akagi, it's a carrier.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.029
The destroyers and two tankers.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.558
Is your list up to date?

56:20.840 --> 56:23.229
It was dated the first of November.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.589
Richard, we got nine Japanese warships missing.

56:27.840 --> 56:30.479
You combine all these ships and you have yourself
a long-range attack formation.

56:30.960 --> 56:32.598
The destroyers protect the carriers,

56:32.720 --> 56:34.790
the tankers refuel them at the center...

56:34.920 --> 56:37.070
...you got a fleet of fighter planes,
each carrying 800 kilogram torpedoes.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.912
They're pulling ships from their main fleet

56:38.960 --> 56:40.678
and we have no idea where they are.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.113
I have a pretty damn good idea.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.992
I checked with our code-breaking units in Washington.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.031
None of these ships have been issued orders
in the last month...

56:46.160 --> 56:47.878
...which means they're probably back

56:48.000 --> 56:49.115
at their bases undergoing repairs.

56:49.320 --> 56:52.278
They're hiding the fact that their ships are incapacitated.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.590
A Japanese delegation is in Washington right now

56:54.640 --> 56:56.835
trying to negotiate a withdrawal from China.

56:56.960 --> 56:59.190
Our oil embargo has brought them to their knees.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.954
They're desperate to get any concessions they
can out of us.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.840
The last thing they want us to know

57:03.840 --> 57:05.592
is that their fleet is under-powered.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.518
I'm late for a meeting. We'll talk about this later.

57:07.840 --> 57:09.592
Conner's been right every step of the way.

57:09.680 --> 57:12.148
Every time we doubted him he's proved us wrong.

57:12.240 --> 57:14.231
We need to watch Tanaka 24 hours a day.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.157
Maybe if you had come to me sooner
I could have backed you up.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.838
The same way you backed up Conner?

57:19.920 --> 57:21.148
What is that supposed to mean?

57:21.240 --> 57:24.118
He was watching the Kaga for weeks. For weeks, Richard.

57:24.200 --> 57:26.350
And he never told you a goddamn thing, why is that?

57:26.440 --> 57:28.829
Well, how the hell can I back him up if he
wouldn't even talk to me?

57:28.960 --> 57:30.075
Look, I don't wanna believe

57:30.120 --> 57:31.712
that Conner died in vain any more that you do...

57:31.800 --> 57:33.119
...but I can't ignore the facts.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.434
He fell in love with a Japanese spy

57:34.480 --> 57:36.550
and she betrayed him, and that's all we've got.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.517
What if she was spying for us?

57:39.400 --> 57:40.958
We've always assumed she seduced Conner.

57:41.040 --> 57:41.916
What if it was the other way around?

57:41.960 --> 57:42.551
You don't know that.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.556
We know she was Tanaka's mistress.

57:45.280 --> 57:47.919
I think Conner found out about them while
he was tailing Lan-Ting.

57:48.040 --> 57:50.270
He saw an opportunity and he took it and he seduced the girl.

57:50.360 --> 57:53.670
Now what if everything Tanaka ever told her got back
to Conner through her?

57:54.120 --> 57:55.838
Even if you're right, she's probably dead.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.389
And what if she's alive?

57:57.440 --> 58:01.558
If she's on the run I can find her.

58:12.320 --> 58:13.753
Thank you, gentlemen.

58:15.640 --> 58:17.596
The meeting's over, Mr. Soames.

58:17.720 --> 58:18.835
I need to speak with you, sir.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.199
Make an appointment like everyone else.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.153
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.556
If I needed to smuggle someone out of Shanghai...

58:24.600 --> 58:26.113
...where would I go for documents?

58:27.160 --> 58:28.149
Why are you asking me?

58:28.200 --> 58:29.872
The young lady I saw you with the other night,

58:29.920 --> 58:31.558
you said you were helping her with her passport.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.718
I didn't say I was doing it illegally.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.751
I don't know any other way you could be doing it.

58:35.840 --> 58:38.593
The British and American Consulate have
stopped issuing papers.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.712
A friend of mine's in trouble with the
Japanese authorities.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.069
I need to get him out of Shanghai now.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.839
I'm sorry, I can't help.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.193
Maybe your wife can.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.199
Are you blackmailing me?

58:53.920 --> 58:55.194
Not unless I have to.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.718
I don't care what you think about me...

58:59.280 --> 59:00.872
...but if you turn these people down...

59:01.600 --> 59:03.079
...their lives are on your conscience.

59:07.440 --> 59:08.873
Quite an impressive operation you've got here, Billy.

59:09.800 --> 59:10.789
Thank you.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.712
You can tell the war's coming to Shanghai

59:12.760 --> 59:15.513
by the number of faces on my wall.

59:15.840 --> 59:18.513
I have a waiting list of 300.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.588
You're lucky you're a friend of Ben's.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.035
I know.

59:24.680 --> 59:26.193
This one won't be convincing.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.198
She's not facing the camera.

59:28.280 --> 59:29.429
It's the best I could do.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.559
Do you get many Japanese clients?

59:32.680 --> 59:34.830
Mostly the Japanese are happy to stay where they are.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.229
Why?

59:37.440 --> 59:39.954
An old buddy of mine was trying to smuggle his
girlfriend out of Shanghai.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.149
I was wondering if they came to you.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.599
Everyone comes to me.

59:42.720 --> 59:43.835
You keep records?

59:43.920 --> 59:46.514
I'd love to find the son of a bitch. He owes me a fortune.

59:47.080 --> 59:49.992
I'm sorry. I guarantee confidentiality.

59:51.480 --> 59:54.313
You'll thank me for it yourself one day.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.995
Sir, have any change?

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.428
Mr. Soames.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.035
You fainted.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.955
I fainted.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.355
Let me see.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.836
Does he take over when you're done?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.151
Only if I don't find out why you were following me.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.468
I wanted to see where you were taking the girl's passport.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.549
Which girl?

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.998
Captain Tanaka's mistress.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.189
Look, Anna.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.032
I followed your man to the safe house after
I delivered your message to the casino.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.196
I actually saw them taking her away.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.597
I didn't realize it at the time...

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.358
...because they'd thrown a blanket over her head.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.388
Leave us alone, please.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.831
Why are you interested in her?

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.795
She was also having an affair with a friend of mine...

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.275
...and he was murdered the night Sumiko disappeared.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.913
We had nothing to do with it.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.473
I'd like to hear that from her.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.672
You're in no position to make demands, Mr. Soames.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.911
Why are you doing it? Why'd you kidnap her?

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.271
Tanaka has arrested hundreds of our people.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.679
We are going to trade her for them.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.074
There's something you need to understand,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.952
Tanaka isn't negotiating

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.592
and he isn't interested in getting this girl back.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.517
He wants her dead.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.631
She wasn't just his mistress.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.030
She was spying on him.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.992
Why should I believe you?

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.395
Because my friend was an American agent.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.710
Whatever it is she knows

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.876
Tanaka won't stop till he finds her...

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.878
...and when he does, he won't leave any of you alive
to talk about it.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.959
Just show me where she is.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.596
I promise you I'll do what I can to help.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.074
I need more time.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.599
You don't have time.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.074
If she's in Shanghai,

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.429
Tanaka's going to find her. No matter what you do,
he'll be waiting.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.675
Do you understand?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.878
Do you understand?

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.195
I'll call you at your hotel this afternoon.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.035
Please...

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.599
don't follow me again.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.077
I had no business thinking about her.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.797
But I couldn't help myself.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.759
I knew it was a mistake.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.876
But I remembered an old saying...

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.911
...The heart is never neutral.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.315
Let's go.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.710
Passport.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.315
The Japanese were allowing only one train a week
to leave Shanghai.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.119
I got the passports for Kita and his girlfriend.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.591
And I arranged for them to be on it

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.833
I was delivering on a promise made by Conner.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.950
It felt like the one decent thing I could do

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.758
U.S. citizen.

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.709
Go. Hurry.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.276
Okay.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.240
Excuse me!

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.355
Create a diversion!

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.636
Papers!

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.276
Get her on the train, I'll meet you as planned.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.595
Nobody boards...

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.510
...without papers!

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.395
Resistance!

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.670
Get her out of here!

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.950
We have to split up! I'll take her.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.310
Go!

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.274
Let me out.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.113
Let me out.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:27.595
I'm an American citizen!

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.392
That's my wife! U.S. passport! U.S. passport!

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.470
Go

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.038
Why didn't you call me?

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.470
My people didn't think they could trust you.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.313
We needed to move the girl

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:57.076
So you told them,

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.475
"I'll smuggle her out of Shanghai and everything
will work out fine"

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.191
Is that it?

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.912
You don't understand

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:03.759
That's quite a risk you took.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.518
She could have turned you in at any minute...

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.796
...or did you tell your boy to shoot her
at the first sign of trouble?

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.711
You had your chance. You followed me instead of her.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.434
Where the fuck you going?

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.631
Where were you supposed to meet
when something went wrong?

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.075
There was no plan.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.839
Bullshit! The girl didn't look too good tonight.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.560
From what I could tell she could barely walk.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.198
What are they going to do to her once she
slows them down? Huh?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.194
They won't hurt her.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.832
Then they'll probably get themselves killed.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.353
How many will that make it, Anna?

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.072
Hey, you can play the heartbroken revolutionary all you
want when I'm not around.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.678
The truth is you used everybody...

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.233
...your friends, your husband,

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:35.237
the girl, and for what?

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.999
Tanaka's still here and your father's still dead.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.308
You want to bring him down?

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:40.759
Tell me where she is!

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.549
You think that's all this is about?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.316
Thousands of people are dying every day.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.950
You think one life makes a difference?

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.676
She can hardly speak.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.559
All she ever asks for is her opium pipe.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.593
I just need to find out...

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.917
...who killed my friend.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.511
Anthony, it's me.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.588
Have you gone to bed yet?

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:52.392
Don't wait up for me.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.433
I'll be home late.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.230
Me too.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.397
I miss you too.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.116
Who is it?

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.596
Yes?

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.995
Captain Tanaka would like to see you.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.678
Has something happened? It's past midnight.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.229
He apologizes.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.555
All right, let's make it quick-- Hey, hold it!

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.755
Wait here, Mr. Soames.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.079
I hope you know you're in violation of
lnternational Settlement laws.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.273
You got no jurisdiction--

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.428
Where is she...

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.994
...Mr. Soames?

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.835
I don't know.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.719
I have no idea.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.999
Mrs. Lan-Ting never asked you for any help?

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.390
Introductions? Passports?

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.551
I'm sure if she had wanted any of those things,

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.511
she'd have gone to you, sir, or her husband.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.390
There's no point in waiting. Proceed.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.677
I'm sorry about these interruptions.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.478
It's an unfortunate business.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.991
We arrested a spy last night.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.273
We arrested him on a train leaving the city.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.676
His lover turned him in.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.710
She was a spy, Mr. Soames.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.879
You would admire her skills.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.271
We did everything we could to break him down.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.197
Even when we put him face to face with the girl

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.834
and she told him what she'd done...

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.831
...he refused to believe it.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.955
It's amazing how a man holds onto an idea...

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.311
...even when that idea is so obviously false.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.549
I suppose it's all we have to keep us going.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.277
You're sure Mrs. Lan-Ting didn't tell you anything?

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.269
I'm sure.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.519
I warn you...

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.989
...it isn't easy to watch.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.759
We'll send an official complaint to their government.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.234
Where are we going?

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.389
To the hotel.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.994
We have to pack your things.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.837
There's a ship leaving Shanghai at 8:00.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.195
The girl's still alive. I've seen her with my own eyes,

01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.434
I can find her.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.440
It's too late. Even if she's still alive

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.873
there's nothing that you can do now.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.911
Your cover is blown. Tanaka won't give you
a second chance.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.349
I don't want a second chance. I want 24 more hours.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.072
Please don't make this harder.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.111
Just get the hell out of Shanghai.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.237
You sure I can't change your mind?

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.113
Not this time.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.039
You finally got sick of me, huh?

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.235
No, are you kidding me?

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.350
I just can't keep up with you.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.916
That's because you're always watching my back.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.398
You know as soon as I get there,

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.636
I'm gonna cause such a stir that they're gonna
have to transfer you...

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.072
Christmas in Shanghai,

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.719
old man. I'm holding you to that.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.429
I'll get the key.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.670
Hello?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.631
My car's parked in front of the hotel.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.592
Well, could you send it up? I'm in a hurry

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.435
Thank you.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.395
An unpaid bar bill.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.998
Is there any other kind?

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.039
Can I give you a hand with any of this?

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:55.950
Paul?

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.276
It's alright.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.630
How is she?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.230
Not good.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.075
Where's Chen?

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.599
I sent him to buy more opium.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.434
She's getting worse. I didn't know what else to do.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.754
We need to get her to a hospital right now
or she's gonna die.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.793
Get the car.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.794
I need you to wake up.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.194
I need you to talk to me, okay? -Okay.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.828
Conner?

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.635
I was so scared.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.229
Why were you scared?

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.679
Tell me why you were scared.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.192
They were waiting for us.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:23.715
Anthony.

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.799
I had no choice.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.912
It was the only way to save you.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.318
Your life in return for hers.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.790
Sumi!

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.875
Sumi! What happened, Sumi?

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.718
There's an American hospital about a mile away.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.153
We might be able to save her.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.157
There won't be anyone left in your hospital
by the time we get there.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.469
Japan has just declared war on the United States.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.832
Our first fleet bombed Pearl Harbor an hour ago.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.389
The invasion of Shanghai is already under way.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.037
There's nothing we can do for her.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.877
We can only ease her pain.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.873
I can't do this alone.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:56.990
Please.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.195
Sumi.

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.518
Sumi. it's me.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.877
What did you think she'd tell you?

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.111
Why you killed my friend.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.113
She betrayed you.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:31.789
That's how he found out about your plans.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.518
I had the proof. He took pictures.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.194
You met with the officers of the Kaga.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.636
I heard about the plan to attack Pearl Harbor
through my informants.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.678
I was never a part of it.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.718
Yes, I killed your friend.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.077
I didn't even know he was a spy when I followed her that night.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.156
I shot him in the dark.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.713
He could...

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.759
...have been anyone.

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.871
You won't suffer now.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.759
Mr. Lan-Ting.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.230
I need to ask your wife some questions.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.711
Ask them at my house.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.637
It's a military matter.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.232
We had a deal.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.955
Our deal was she wouldn't be harmed.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.792
This isn't just business.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.113
We're talking about my wife.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.639
I don't have time to argue.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.360
She isn't going anywhere with you.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:44.669
She'll be returned safely.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.834
I'll be back.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.275
Don't worry.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.110
Please.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.115
Captain!

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:55.750
Wait.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.955
Anthony.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.270
Paul...

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.115
...please.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.989
We have to leave.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.912
This is Radio Shanghai.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.076
The United States of America is at war...

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.116
Paul, I need your help to get her out of here.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.156
Passports!

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.269
I'm driving for him.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:49.950
Passports!

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.155
Go to hell!

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.275
Darling,

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.631
Darling, I'm sorry.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.673
What did you say?

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.754
I can't hear you.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.919
I'm sorry Anthony.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:27.709
I can't protect you anymore. You must leave Shanghai.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:30.315
Promise me.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.632
Please, get her out of Shanghai.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.520
No matter what happens stay close to me.
When we get to the port

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.670
they'll only evacuate Europeans and Americans.

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:26.795
Come on! Anna.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:51.950
Come on, Anna,

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.394
we gotta get to the port!

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:19.909
Stay close!

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.754
Hold on to my arm!

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:34.876
Anna!

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.189
Anna!

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.309
Anna!

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.549
Hold on to my arm! Anna! Come on!

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:07.229
The port is now under-- Please stay calm, sir.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.998
The port is now under the control
of the Japanese Army.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:12.032
Foreign nationals will still be allowed to leave.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.712
We left the house when we heard the first explosion.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.518
I was sure I had the passports with me.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.596
Well, I can issue you temporary passes

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.915
I just have to ask you a few questions

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.235
to satisfy the Japanese authorities.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.359
So, what were you doing in China?

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.078
I came to help a friend with his business.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.317
The business went bust, but fortunately I met my wife.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.400
I guess you start looking for something...

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.277
...and end up finding something else.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:42.748
And where do you plan to move after you leave China,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick?

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.074
We haven't had much time to think about it.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.150
Your country is at war.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:53.916
Your people are fighting for their lives.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.119
Why are you leaving?

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.911
I'm going with my husband.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.759
One day I will return.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.954
We have to get out of this line.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.994
He still hasn't seen us.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.040
My wife's very ill. We have to get out of this line, please.

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.838
Please, my wife is very sick. I have to get her
out of this line.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:41.756
She's very sick, please.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.392
When he sees me I want you to keep walking.

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.271
No, no

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.313
Anna, Anna, please.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.350
No.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.234
The world had changed.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.917
...and it would never be the same.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.318
In Europe and in Asia the cities were burning...

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.352
...and the hunters came out at night.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.157
Anna got off the boat in Macao.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.589
I knew she'd go back to Shanghai.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.758
She worked with the resistance.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.195
Somehow she stayed alive.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.788
Maybe luck, maybe courage.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.348
You had to have both.

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.279
I know because I did the same thing

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.876
in other cities under different names.

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.032
Until the long night ended.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:41.794
But Shanghai haunted me...

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.759
...so I returned...

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.589
..to her.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.589
