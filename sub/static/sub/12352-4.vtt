WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.301
Previously on Greek...

00:01.335 --> 00:02.869
This semester, I wanna invest

00:02.904 --> 00:04.437
some more time in R&D.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.573
Research and development
is going to be really crucial.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.974
I meant rusty and Dana.

00:08.009 --> 00:10.243
Ashleigh?!

00:10.278 --> 00:12.412
- What're you doing here?
- I got fired.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.282
I know you said it's important
we get into a study group,

00:15.316 --> 00:18.852
the other students have frozen me
out because of this rumor so...

00:18.886 --> 00:20.687
Could you assign me to a group?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.822
This is an adversarial
profession, miss Cartwright.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.592
How you deal with it will determine
your success or your failure.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.128
We have a newly arrived transfer
student, please welcome miss Parker.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.930
- Katherine?
- Hello, Casey!

00:29.964 --> 00:31.932
You cheated on me
because you don't believe

00:31.966 --> 00:33.633
you deserve happiness,
but you do.

00:33.668 --> 00:35.001
And we can find that together.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.570
I'd like to try.

00:37.605 --> 00:41.574
I miss Evan. And he wanted to get a good night's
sleep before his first day of law school.

00:48.683 --> 00:49.816
Hello?

00:51.452 --> 00:52.986
Yes, I'm really up.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.957
No, I won't fall back asleep.

01:01.896 --> 01:05.732
I'm awake! Yes,
yes, Pengy's up too.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.470
Do I really have to say it?

01:10.504 --> 01:12.639
Ok.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.975
I'm the star of my own life.

01:15.009 --> 01:17.143
I deserve to be center stage.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.614
Thanks, mom. I love you too.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.522
You stay sleeping, lucky.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.864
<i>- Mmm! Guten morgen, Beav.
- Hey, cap.</i>

01:37.898 --> 01:39.566
You know how I'm
philanthropy chair and stuff?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.568
Yep. And philanthropy means...

01:41.602 --> 01:43.203
No, I remember this time.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.705
But I got an e-mail from IFC
last night that said

01:45.740 --> 01:47.807
they got a tip
that our philanthropy,

01:47.842 --> 01:51.044
Phil and Ann's wild pussy cat
refuge for Africa is a fake.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.013
What!?

01:53.047 --> 01:55.448
It is fake.
It has been for years.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.850
Those damned Omega chis!

01:56.884 --> 01:59.452
Don't worry. We'll figure
something out. We always do.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.622
You know, I think that we should
go over there and give....

02:04.658 --> 02:06.292
- Pop tart pb and j?
- Not now.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.428
Turns out there's
a team of students at mit

02:08.461 --> 02:10.030
developing
a self-healing wire too.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.531
We have to get ours done first.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.533
So, in six hours, we're pitching
the university

02:13.567 --> 02:15.135
to ask for more research money.

02:15.169 --> 02:18.138
Hey, do you guys do a lot of
boss/secretary role-playing?

02:18.172 --> 02:21.007
- Since Dana's your assistant? - Yeah.
Yeah, I'm the "assistant." Yeah.

02:21.042 --> 02:24.310
- I get his coffee, make his appointments...
- Take my dictation...

02:24.345 --> 02:27.881
Yeah she does! Well, good luck
with your "dictation".

02:27.915 --> 02:29.716
See you guys later,
I'm late for...

02:29.750 --> 02:31.885
- Beaver, watch out... no!
- No!

02:31.919 --> 02:34.154
- Aw, Beav!
- Oh, sorry I broke your toy.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.223
I'll buy you a new one, ok?
But right now I've got to get to ZBZ.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.559
Now we'll never be able...

02:41.629 --> 02:43.930
Ok ladies, pledge
presents is the first time

02:43.964 --> 02:47.100
you will be publicly identified
as ZBZ pledges.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.668
Let's start with hee-ther, go.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.508
If you can't walk down the
stairs in platform heels,

02:55.543 --> 02:57.644
you have no business
being in a sorority.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.712
Once you descend,
stop at the bottom

02:59.747 --> 03:01.548
where I, as president,
will be waiting.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.316
Oh, which reminds me!

03:03.350 --> 03:05.185
You may get a call from
prospective employers.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.753
'Cause I used
"Rebecca Logan, president"

03:06.787 --> 03:08.955
as a reference for
this marketing firm job.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.458
- I used "Casey Cartwright, lawyer"
too many times. - Ok.

03:11.492 --> 03:15.228
Hi, Beav.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.130
I was just hoping you guys
were gonna start making out.

03:17.164 --> 03:20.433
You're supposed to be moving furniture to
get this place ready for pledge presents.

03:20.468 --> 03:23.703
- Sorry.
- Ok.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.344
- Pretty lady.
- What's that?

03:32.847 --> 03:36.049
Beaver, you remember my friend
Katherine, from pan-hellenic?

03:36.083 --> 03:37.617
She was at Yale law?

03:37.651 --> 03:40.920
She transferred after getting
into Cru's jd/mba program,

03:40.955 --> 03:42.622
- which is amazing!
- Thank you.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.091
I'm so pleased to be here.
And I look forward to the fun challenge

03:45.126 --> 03:46.226
of pursuing my dual degree.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.799
- We should go. Yeah.
- Ok.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.669
Pretty lady!

03:57.538 --> 03:59.372
Beav.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.478
Pardon me, bing,

04:05.513 --> 04:08.848
I was just moving your girlfriend's breast.
I meant chest.

04:08.883 --> 04:11.651
Of panties. I mean drawers.
Actually it's a bookcase.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.386
And I was just leaving.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.190
Hey, Rebecca? Do you really need
that guy to help you...

04:18.459 --> 04:20.026
Move?

04:20.060 --> 04:22.529
Walter Boudreaux?...

04:22.563 --> 04:25.465
- Walter Boudreaux?
- Here!

04:30.337 --> 04:32.372
An "f"! Why?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.574
Because you and a dozen others,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.442
mainly members
of the football team,

04:36.477 --> 04:40.680
<i>all turned in the exact same
paper on to kill a mockingbird.</i>

04:40.714 --> 04:42.815
Any chance you'll believe
they all copied me?

04:45.486 --> 04:49.389
Mr. Boudreaux, I'm giving you a
chance to write this paper yourself.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.658
- By tomorrow morning.
- Or...?

04:51.692 --> 04:52.892
Or the "f" stays.

04:52.927 --> 04:56.229
But... what about the children?

Put it on your tab.

05:23.109 --> 05:24.509
Thanks, joni.

05:28.047 --> 05:30.715
<i>Beav! Did you watch
glee last night?</i>

05:30.750 --> 05:34.052
Yeah. Can you believe they almost
shut down the glee club down again?

05:34.086 --> 05:37.088
What a close call. Again.

05:39.792 --> 05:43.461
"When he was nearly thirteen,
my brother Jem..."

05:46.065 --> 05:50.135
- Pretty lady! - I can't believe our
first prelim exam is next week!

05:50.169 --> 05:53.038
- Hello, ladies!
- Oh. Hi, beaver.

05:53.072 --> 05:55.206
I don't have a study group

05:55.241 --> 05:57.776
because of everyone thinking I'm
a whore who slept my way in.

05:57.810 --> 06:00.278
You don't have a group for a much
less embarrassing reason. So...

06:00.313 --> 06:04.316
<i>I don't have a study group either.
I'm reading don't mock the killer birds all by myself.</i>

06:04.350 --> 06:06.051
Anyway, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:06.085 --> 06:07.919
That study groups are
a waste of time,

06:07.954 --> 06:11.423
an excuse for lesser students to leech off
of those of us who know what we're doing?

06:11.457 --> 06:13.792
Totally!

06:13.826 --> 06:18.263
Just think of all those losers
trying to mooch off us!

06:18.297 --> 06:20.832
- It just makes me want to puke!
- Me too!

06:20.866 --> 06:24.936
I hate losers... so, where are
you two pretty ladies off to?

06:24.971 --> 06:26.705
-)Well, I have to...
- That's great. Kathy?

06:26.739 --> 06:28.673
I have a business strategy
class.

06:28.708 --> 06:32.978
So I'll just see you both,
around...

06:33.012 --> 06:34.713
Later.

06:38.384 --> 06:41.052
Where have you been hiding
this smokalicious hottie?!

06:41.087 --> 06:46.124
Forget it, beav. She is a brainiac who's
into nerds, like rusty and al Gore.

06:46.158 --> 06:48.827
And apparently doesn't believe
in study groups.

06:50.863 --> 06:53.999
- I want some of that.
- I want some of that, too.

06:57.870 --> 07:00.138
Professor Hastings, I know
this is all my fault.

07:00.172 --> 07:01.973
Well, yeah, I feel stupid.

07:02.008 --> 07:05.643
Yeah, I'll fix it!
Ok, I'll see you there.

07:07.847 --> 07:09.280
You're still working on that?

07:09.315 --> 07:11.816
Yes, I am still trying to fix
the model you stepped on.

07:11.851 --> 07:14.085
And I've got four hours before
I have to pitch these funders.

07:14.120 --> 07:17.022
Cool. I just looked through
the kt test file

07:17.056 --> 07:19.457
<i>trying to find another
to kill a mockingbird paper,</i>

07:19.492 --> 07:20.992
but it's the same one
I already turned in.

07:21.027 --> 07:23.661
Can you do some smart people
stuff on my paper?

07:23.696 --> 07:25.430
I'm a scientist, not a writer.

07:25.464 --> 07:26.698
Try reading the book.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.634
Never mind. I'll ask Cappie.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.637
- Beav!
- Sorry.

07:33.973 --> 07:34.939
Miss Howard.

07:34.974 --> 07:37.809
Mr... Beaver.
Hey, rusty.

07:37.843 --> 07:40.478
- Look at you being all science-y!
Which is perfect......

07:40.513 --> 07:43.415
Because I just put down "rusty
Cartwright, scientist," as a job reference,

07:43.449 --> 07:46.918
- if that's cool with you. - As long as they
don't call today. I gotta rebuild my model

07:46.952 --> 07:50.688
and try to finish my pitch for these
university funders at the same time.

07:50.723 --> 07:52.824
Oh. "The existing
wire insulation

07:52.858 --> 07:55.493
is comprised of a three-layer
polyamide-surlyn..."

07:55.528 --> 07:58.263
Oh, my God, I'm so bored.
And your audience will be, too.

07:58.297 --> 08:00.632
Well, scientists don't care
about the "flashy stuff".

08:00.666 --> 08:02.700
Everybody cares about
the "flashy stuff".

08:02.735 --> 08:05.136
You're not asking for an "a",
you're asking for money.

08:05.171 --> 08:08.306
So, where... where are
your buzzwords? Your visuals?

08:09.909 --> 08:12.777
Oh! Why don't you let me
spice up your pitch?

08:12.812 --> 08:15.613
Then you'll count as a legitimate employer
and I won't be lying on my resume!

08:15.648 --> 08:17.649
- That's really important.
- And I'm really awesome.

08:17.683 --> 08:21.119
I can sell anything, I sold samir
to a gamma psi at that nerd auction

08:21.153 --> 08:23.421
even after he tried
to pop-and-lock on stage!

08:23.456 --> 08:25.390
It couldn't hurt.

08:27.293 --> 08:29.294
I'll pay you, like...
50 bucks?

08:29.328 --> 08:31.930
Oh, rusty, I couldn't possibly
take your money.

08:31.964 --> 08:34.599
But if I did, and I will, I couldn't
do it for any less than 75.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.301
- 'Cause it's a rush job.
- Sixty.

08:36.335 --> 08:37.936
One dollar!

08:37.970 --> 08:40.205
I've been watching way too
many daytime game shows.

08:40.239 --> 08:43.775
Sixty... sixty will be fine.

08:50.850 --> 08:52.984
I have a paper due tomorrow
and I'm gonna fail!

08:53.018 --> 08:54.586
But what about the children?

08:54.620 --> 08:57.555
I know! They're the future.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.124
What's the class?

08:59.158 --> 09:00.325
Modern American literature.

09:00.359 --> 09:02.760
Casey aced that. Go ask her.

09:02.795 --> 09:06.197
Casey, huh? Do you have any special
message you want me to give her?

09:06.232 --> 09:09.934
Beav, the last time I had you give her
a message it didn't exactly end well.

09:09.969 --> 09:12.036
Ok. I can't help it if
"I'm going to be late"

09:12.071 --> 09:13.771
sounds like
"I'm going to masturbate."

09:13.806 --> 09:15.573
Exactly.

09:17.676 --> 09:18.943
Bing approaches, 3:00.

09:21.013 --> 09:24.449
Hey big guy, if anyone's gonna help
Rebecca move her stuff, it's gonna be me.

09:24.483 --> 09:27.752
You know, it's not beaver's fault that
women like to cheat on you, Evan.

09:27.786 --> 09:30.054
There's no reason for you
to get involved in this, cap.

09:30.089 --> 09:34.225
Oh, sure there is. You and your brothers
ratted us out to IFC for philanthropy hours.

09:34.260 --> 09:39.164
Which gives me license to pretty much involve
myself however I want, crabtree and Evan-lyn.

09:39.198 --> 09:41.733
First of all, I'm not
a brother anymore, cap.

09:41.767 --> 09:45.069
I'm an Omega chi alum, in law
school and dating Rebecca.

09:45.104 --> 09:48.706
So, some of us have more important things to
worry about than your philanthropy hours.

09:48.741 --> 09:51.376
So let's just call this off,
disengage,

09:51.410 --> 09:54.045
forget we ever met.
Have a nice life.

09:55.381 --> 09:58.983
Yeah, you have a real nice
important law douche life...

09:59.018 --> 10:00.351
Law douche.

10:00.386 --> 10:02.787
Yeah, go on.
Get out of my sight!

10:04.156 --> 10:06.925
- I think that's where he is, cap.
- Good.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.193
Just where I want him.

10:12.998 --> 10:14.566
Three hours left.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.402
That is what you get for
thinking your fraternity house

10:17.436 --> 10:20.205
is a good place for doing
any sort of important work!

10:20.239 --> 10:23.641
The frat house is where you go for
shots and flatulence, not science.

10:23.676 --> 10:26.211
Don't worry, I will never
let him do that again.

10:26.245 --> 10:30.081
So, I've added three key buzzwords
throughout the power point presentation:

10:30.115 --> 10:32.617
"Revolutionary, environmental",
and "insulation".

10:32.651 --> 10:35.620
Are you sure I can't replace
"insulation" with "explosive?"

10:35.654 --> 10:38.556
- Ash... - R!
E goal is to convince the funders

10:38.591 --> 10:41.859
that the wire constitutes an
advancement in safe connectivity,

10:41.894 --> 10:44.629
not that it might take out a city block.
Who is this person?

10:44.663 --> 10:47.365
She's our marketing consultant.

10:47.399 --> 10:51.236
I'll be right back. I need a solder
sucker from storage. Excuse me.

10:51.270 --> 10:54.973
I didn't authorize a marketing
consultant in our budget!

10:56.008 --> 10:58.309
Oh, so I forgot to ask rusty.

10:58.344 --> 11:00.211
Who do I list as project
inventors?

11:00.246 --> 11:03.214
Just rusty, or him
and that scary man?

11:03.249 --> 11:04.816
Both of them, and me too.

11:04.850 --> 11:06.551
Oh! Really?

11:06.585 --> 11:09.320
Yeah, it's standard
for my level of contribution.

11:09.355 --> 11:11.656
Oh. Ok, will do...

11:16.895 --> 11:19.597
You build towers
with your books too?

11:19.632 --> 11:21.833
No, no. I am slowly
losing my mind.

11:21.867 --> 11:24.302
And why am I seeing you more
often today than ever before?

11:24.336 --> 11:26.938
Maybe I've been there all along,
but you never noticed.

11:26.972 --> 11:31.209
Ok. I am... I am kinda busy.
Not to mention screwed.

11:33.512 --> 11:36.981
<i>Guess that means I'll get an "f" on
my Tequila-drinking bird paper.</i>

11:37.016 --> 11:42.520
For that modern American lit class which
someone, who is not Cappie, told me you aced.

11:42.554 --> 11:48.259
I did ace that class, but I have something
insane like 1500 pages of reading to do.

11:48.294 --> 11:52.196
By myself. Because someone thinks
study groups are for dummies.

11:52.231 --> 11:55.166
- It's cool. I don't mind just copying your paper.
- Ok, that is cheating!

11:55.200 --> 11:57.835
And I have my own problems...

11:57.870 --> 12:00.538
Oh. Like the fact that
my fellow law school students

12:00.572 --> 12:02.707
are all sociopaths!
Look at this!

12:02.741 --> 12:05.109
Every fifth page!

12:05.144 --> 12:06.711
"Suck it", that's pretty funny.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.080
And uncalled for.

12:11.283 --> 12:12.950
I really thought that Katherine

12:12.985 --> 12:16.988
was going to be
my law school salvation.

12:17.022 --> 12:18.690
But nope, I don't have
a study group,

12:18.724 --> 12:21.726
therefore I can not divide and
conquer the case summaries

12:21.760 --> 12:23.061
like everyone else...

12:23.095 --> 12:25.563
Case summaries?
What are those?

12:25.597 --> 12:29.133
Just, like, summaries
of the cases we're studying.

12:29.168 --> 12:32.270
Each person in a study group
covers a certain number.

12:32.304 --> 12:35.573
- Then we swap summaries to study from.
- I can get you those.

12:35.607 --> 12:38.810
- Don't mess with me right now. - I'm serious.
So, how about we make a deal?

12:38.844 --> 12:43.081
I get you the case summaries,
you give me your paper?

12:47.285 --> 12:49.954
Ok. This guy Dave, and I don't
even think that's his real name,

12:49.988 --> 12:52.690
is very mysterious.
I've never even met him.

12:52.724 --> 12:56.060
But he sells papers and tests
and all kinds of stuff.

12:56.094 --> 12:57.862
And you really expect me to
believe he's going to have...

12:57.896 --> 13:01.332
Case summaries from Segal's torts class!?
Oh my God!

13:01.366 --> 13:05.369
Yep. I bought my killer bird paper on here.
Not that I condone cheating.

13:05.404 --> 13:08.172
Or know what condone means.
But sometimes you just get desperate.

13:08.206 --> 13:11.242
- And it's for the children.
- I don't condone cheating either.

13:11.276 --> 13:14.178
Of course not.
This is just a study aid!

13:14.212 --> 13:17.281
I need your paper as a study
aid. A study aid I can copy.

13:17.315 --> 13:19.517
I don't have a study group.
What is going on?

13:19.551 --> 13:21.118
The site keeps crashing!

13:21.153 --> 13:24.655
Beaver? Is there like a...
Customer service number you can call?

13:24.689 --> 13:26.657
No, it doesn't work like that.

13:26.691 --> 13:29.860
He doesn't give out his
phone number or anything.

13:29.895 --> 13:32.463
Ok.

13:32.497 --> 13:35.032
<i>This is my to kill a mockingbird paper.
Which I got an "a" on.</i>

13:35.066 --> 13:39.303
If you help me find Dave, I will give you my paper.
Now think, beaver, think!

13:41.306 --> 13:44.241
Ok, someone once told me
where he works.

13:44.276 --> 13:47.077
What's that city... the tan
girls with the fake boobs?

13:47.112 --> 13:49.880
- La?
- No. In the other America?

13:51.850 --> 13:53.184
Rio de Janeiro?

13:53.218 --> 13:55.252
Yes, Dave works in Rio!

13:55.287 --> 13:56.954
That's where we have to go.

13:58.657 --> 13:59.690
Or...?

14:01.660 --> 14:03.327
Or his apartment
might be closer.

14:03.361 --> 14:05.529
You know where he lives
but not his phone number?

14:05.564 --> 14:07.698
You can sometimes drop off
payments there.

14:07.732 --> 14:09.834
- Let's go. Let's go.
- All right. Are you driving?

14:09.868 --> 14:10.835
- Yes.
- Ok.

14:10.869 --> 14:12.369
I want you all

14:12.404 --> 14:14.238
to go home and relax.

14:14.272 --> 14:18.242
Tonight is all about sisterhood.

14:18.276 --> 14:22.480
If you're not perfect, if you trip down
the stairs, does it really matter?

14:22.514 --> 14:26.083
Yes. So get it together
before tonight! Good luck!

14:31.456 --> 14:34.358
Oh! What's in the backpack?

14:34.392 --> 14:38.262
Champagne lunch for two? Or
something naughtier... for two?

14:38.296 --> 14:42.900
Oh, yeah. If you find
civil procedure erotic.

14:42.934 --> 14:45.669
- Oh. Law school stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

14:45.704 --> 14:48.839
Well, put it out of your mind.
Tonight is all about pledge presents!

14:48.874 --> 14:51.208
Pledge presents...
...Right.

14:51.243 --> 14:52.309
What, did you forget?

14:52.344 --> 14:53.611
No, no, of course not.

14:53.645 --> 14:57.781
I didn't forget, it's just
my first exam is next week.

14:57.816 --> 14:59.750
So if it's ok with you...
I might just skip tonight?

14:59.784 --> 15:01.485
I have to meet
with my study group.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.854
And this would be my fifth
pledge presents,

15:03.889 --> 15:05.623
and it is the
same thing every year.

15:05.657 --> 15:06.790
Do you mind?

15:08.193 --> 15:10.194
I totally get it.

15:10.996 --> 15:12.863
- Ooh.
- As president,

15:12.898 --> 15:15.566
it would be weird for me not to have
a date at my first pledge presents.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.434
So I guess I'll find
someone else.

15:17.469 --> 15:19.737
Well... you know what?

15:19.771 --> 15:22.706
- What? - I can probably find
someone from Omega chi to take you.

15:22.741 --> 15:24.375
I think Calvin's free.

15:26.211 --> 15:28.646
You've got a law school exam,
you don't need to spend time

15:28.680 --> 15:30.881
worrying about
some silly sorority event.

15:30.916 --> 15:33.384
- Now you get to that study group!
- You sure?

15:33.418 --> 15:36.887
- Mm-hmm.
- You're the best.

15:45.764 --> 15:48.499
Hey, ashleigh?
Hey, what do you think?

15:50.669 --> 15:54.772
How about less Stephen Hawking, and more...
hmm? Is there a hot science guy?

15:54.806 --> 15:58.275
- Carl sagan? Those turtlenecks?
- We'll change you in a second.

15:58.310 --> 16:01.412
But first, don't you want to look
at the presentation one last time?

16:01.446 --> 16:03.647
It's great. Can we worry
about my clothes first?

16:03.682 --> 16:06.517
Looks aren't important, can you
just look at the credits section?

16:11.423 --> 16:13.457
- It's fine.
- Oh,

16:13.491 --> 16:17.194
I was so convinced that you'd be upset
that Dana's listed as co-inventor.

16:19.230 --> 16:20.230
What?

16:22.734 --> 16:24.335
Did Dana tell you
to put her name down?

16:24.369 --> 16:26.470
She said it was
standard procedure.

16:26.504 --> 16:29.406
But, I guess it's not...?

16:36.348 --> 16:37.681
Where can I find beaver?

16:37.716 --> 16:39.783
The beaver is native
to north America

16:39.818 --> 16:42.353
and parts of Europe. But if
you're referring to the slang,

16:42.387 --> 16:44.655
- and given your past, I can only assume...
- Cut the crap, cap.

16:44.689 --> 16:47.291
- Where is he?
- He has some big paper due tomorrow.

16:47.325 --> 16:50.961
Why, you need some more furniture moved?
I'm fairly broad-shouldered.

16:50.996 --> 16:53.464
Actually, you're better.

16:53.498 --> 16:55.199
Why, thank you.

16:55.233 --> 16:58.535
And thank you,
shake weight for men.

17:01.740 --> 17:03.340
Will you be my date
for pledge presents?

17:03.375 --> 17:05.442
Don't get excited,
it's just for show.

17:05.477 --> 17:08.045
And if you're worried about running
into Casey, she's not coming anyway.

17:08.079 --> 17:11.682
Ok... and what about
your boyfriend?

17:11.715 --> 17:13.584
He can't be bothered
with a sorority party.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.519
Not when there's a law school
study group to go to.

17:15.553 --> 17:20.124
I see. And you want me to be your
accomplice for your self-sabotage,

17:20.157 --> 17:21.692
just so you can
get a rise out of Evan?

17:21.726 --> 17:23.627
- If you don't want to do it...
- Stop talking.

17:26.196 --> 17:27.765
I'm in.

17:37.475 --> 17:39.443
Oh, my God, sorry, I thought
I was gonna be late.

17:39.477 --> 17:41.645
Yeah, that would've been bad.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.982
You know, because co-inventors
are supposed to be timely.

17:45.016 --> 17:48.452
So they can invent stuff...
On time.

17:48.486 --> 17:52.289
- Huh? - You told ashleigh to
list you as a co-inventor?

17:52.323 --> 17:55.526
- And you didn't ask me first?
- I didn't think it was necessary.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.127
I just assumed
you'd give me credit.

17:57.162 --> 17:59.530
Of course I would have
acknowledged your work,

17:59.564 --> 18:01.765
but co-inventor?

18:01.800 --> 18:05.402
You came onto the project
after I had developed the idea.

18:05.437 --> 18:07.538
You should have asked me first.
That's what I would have done.

18:07.572 --> 18:10.340
And I would have said
you didn't even need to ask,

18:10.375 --> 18:13.177
you were absolutely essential
to the project's success.

18:13.211 --> 18:15.512
You have been essential.
As an assistant.

18:15.547 --> 18:17.214
Wow.

18:17.248 --> 18:19.149
Yeah, no. I'm just your
secretary or whatever,

18:19.184 --> 18:20.451
like your friend Cooter said!

18:20.485 --> 18:23.220
I have been much more than that
and you know it!

18:27.358 --> 18:29.660
They're ready for you.

18:30.962 --> 18:32.162
What's wrong?

18:32.197 --> 18:33.997
- We're all good.
- Nothing.

18:43.141 --> 18:45.309
Why are we at
the posting place?

18:45.343 --> 18:46.977
This is where Dave lives.

18:47.011 --> 18:49.780
P.O. Box 417, Cyprus, Ohio...

18:49.814 --> 18:52.616
- ...Zip code 45...
- Beaver. Beaver!

18:52.650 --> 18:56.186
This is just where he picks up his mail.
Probably to maintain secrecy.

18:56.221 --> 18:58.155
That makes sense.

18:58.189 --> 19:00.991
You'd never be able to fit any
furniture into one of those things.

19:01.025 --> 19:02.926
Right.

19:02.961 --> 19:05.462
So how do we find Dave now?

19:05.497 --> 19:08.832
- Term paper Dave? That guy?
- Yeah. You know him?

19:08.867 --> 19:12.102
We've had adjoining boxes
for years.

19:12.137 --> 19:15.339
You might be out of luck though
if you're looking to cheat.

19:15.373 --> 19:18.175
Well, Dave went out of business
all of a sudden.

19:18.209 --> 19:19.510
He did? Why?!

19:19.544 --> 19:23.113
Maybe business was slow.

19:23.148 --> 19:26.583
Maybe he died.
I'll miss him.

19:26.618 --> 19:29.019
He had some interesting theories on
how to dismantle the government.

19:31.322 --> 19:34.024
Do you have any idea where
we could find Dave?

19:34.058 --> 19:36.960
Yellow 31, 27, hut hut hut.

19:36.995 --> 19:38.362
Maybe we should just go...

19:38.396 --> 19:41.465
The CRU football team. They're
his customer base. Try them.

19:44.969 --> 19:48.071
The football team!
You know those guys, beaver.

19:48.106 --> 19:50.340
You were on the team...
Briefly.

19:50.375 --> 19:52.309
I don't know.
Those guys are...

19:53.745 --> 19:56.413
I think they're racist.
We do not wanna talk to them.

19:56.447 --> 19:59.850
Beaver, what the hell are you talking about?
Stop being weird and let's go.

19:59.884 --> 20:02.719
You sure we can't just
go to Rio? Road trip!

20:07.961 --> 20:10.963
Hey. Hi. Don't worry,
I'm not a perv,

20:10.997 --> 20:13.565
I'm just...
I'm here with...

20:13.599 --> 20:14.900
Beaver?! What are you doing?

20:14.934 --> 20:17.502
I haven't talked to these
guys since I quit the team.

20:17.537 --> 20:20.339
- It could be awkward.
- Whoa! Boudreaux!

20:20.373 --> 20:23.976
- Dude, is that you? Man!
- Oh!

20:24.010 --> 20:26.211
What happened, man?

20:26.245 --> 20:29.715
High School all-American, number one recruit,
disappears, we never hear from you again?

20:29.749 --> 20:32.417
- Disappears?
- We're looking for someone.

20:32.452 --> 20:36.054
- Dave, the guy who sells the papers?
- Right, Dave. Our tutor.

20:36.089 --> 20:38.890
- - Yeah, he's
pretty hard to track down.

20:38.925 --> 20:42.928
- Your best bet is to try Rio.
- I told you Rio de Janeiro!

20:42.962 --> 20:45.864
Yeah, Rio nightclub. It's about
half-a-mile down route 23,

20:45.898 --> 20:47.966
just over the border in rhodes.
Big neon sign.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.434
Or... Rio could be a bar.

20:49.469 --> 20:51.370
Rio could be a bar.

20:51.404 --> 20:53.839
Oh. Thanks, guys.

20:55.174 --> 20:58.477
Yeah. Keep working out.
You look great.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.952
Self-healing wire technology,
invented by...

21:12.125 --> 21:13.959
Let's move on.
This self-healing wire

21:13.993 --> 21:16.228
has the ability
to "revolutionize"

21:16.262 --> 21:19.364
fields ranging from home
electricity to space travel.

21:19.399 --> 21:23.635
And its environmental applications are
even more exciting. Once I found...

21:23.669 --> 21:27.172
Once we changed the coating
material to polysiloxane...

21:27.206 --> 21:30.342
Yes, I found the polysiloxane

21:30.376 --> 21:33.745
is effective without
greenhouse gas emissions.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.481
The reactant core is what
allows this to happen...

21:36.516 --> 21:40.118
Supported by a polymer shell.
Without the shell, the core wouldn't work.

21:40.153 --> 21:42.320
Yes, the shell
"assists" the core...

21:42.355 --> 21:45.157
The core is lucky to have
the shell catch its mistakes.

21:45.191 --> 21:49.261
In fact, the truth is that the shell
has been carrying the core all along

21:49.295 --> 21:53.398
because the shell is smarter than the
core, and the core can't handle it!

21:53.433 --> 21:55.734
You think you've
been carrying me?

21:55.768 --> 21:59.304
Why don't we go
straight to the q&a?

22:08.114 --> 22:12.484
You were great in practice
today. Your walk was the best.

22:12.518 --> 22:14.152
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

22:14.187 --> 22:17.689
But you kept me in the mandatory
practice room for three hours.

22:17.723 --> 22:19.858
I can't let the girls know
you're my favorite pledge.

22:19.892 --> 22:22.661
- I am?
- Uh-huh.

22:22.695 --> 22:25.430
So listen, who are you bringing
to pledge presents tonight?

22:25.465 --> 22:27.666
My brother heath was gonna take
me but he can't make it.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.034
So he set me up with
one of his gay friends.

22:29.068 --> 22:30.735
Heath's been really
over-protective

22:30.770 --> 22:33.038
ever since one of his brothers
hit on me when I was 15.

22:33.072 --> 22:36.875
Oh my God, I just realized that heath
the kappa tau is your brother!

22:36.909 --> 22:40.345
You know, I'm bringing a kappa tau tonight.
My ex, Cappie.

22:40.379 --> 22:43.381
- But what about Evan?
- He's busy with law school crap.

22:43.416 --> 22:46.284
But wait!

22:47.553 --> 22:49.821
I just realized that
heath is dating Calvin.

22:49.856 --> 22:53.625
Oh no, what if you letlip to heath
that I'm bringing Cappie tonight

22:53.659 --> 22:56.161
and then heath tells Calvin and
Calvin tells his good buddy Evan?

22:56.195 --> 22:57.963
Evan would be so jealous.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.833
I did not foresee
this complication.

23:04.537 --> 23:07.339
Wait. Do you want me to make sure Evan
finds out you're bringing Cappie?

23:08.341 --> 23:10.642
Not bad, pledge.
Can you do it?

23:10.676 --> 23:11.943
Are you kidding?

23:11.978 --> 23:13.812
<i>I've seen every city
of the real housewives.</i>

23:13.846 --> 23:16.214
I've been waiting for this
moment my whole life.

23:25.358 --> 23:27.726
I really thought you and Dana
would be perfect together,

23:27.760 --> 23:30.395
supporting each other
in the cutthroat science world.

23:30.429 --> 23:32.964
But she doesn't seem supportive.

23:32.999 --> 23:35.967
I mean, thinking she was
carrying you this whole time?

23:36.002 --> 23:40.005
- She seems as bad as
my ex, Travis. - That jerk?

23:40.039 --> 23:43.208
I don't know, when you're with
someone who doesn't believe in you,

23:43.242 --> 23:44.743
you end up not believing
in yourself.

23:44.777 --> 23:47.946
What
kind of relationship is that?

23:49.482 --> 23:51.383
Hastings e-mailed!

23:51.417 --> 23:54.519
"The committee agreed that
the wire is important enough

23:54.554 --> 23:57.656
- to warrant additional funding.
" - Oh, that's great!

23:57.690 --> 24:00.458
Wow. "So important,
that they feel

24:00.493 --> 24:03.995
it should be in the hands
of an actual research team."

24:07.667 --> 24:09.401
They pulled me off the project.

24:15.041 --> 24:16.741
I lost my wire.

24:24.550 --> 24:28.920
Ok, the bar said Dave's shift starts at 8:30,
so we should get there 15 minutes early.

24:28.955 --> 24:30.789
Should we synchronize
our watches?

24:30.823 --> 24:35.293
Two white chocolate raspberry
mochas, triple-whip. Scones on me.

24:35.328 --> 24:37.929
- Thank you.
- Oh!

24:37.964 --> 24:41.433
I have never had such good service here.
Or any service at all.

24:41.467 --> 24:43.602
Well, I did save Joni's life
that one time.

24:43.636 --> 24:45.270
What?

24:45.304 --> 24:48.240
She choked on a chocolate-covered
espresso bean, I gave her the hemlock.

24:48.274 --> 24:50.308
I can't believe
I never knew that about you.

24:50.343 --> 24:52.611
It seems there's a lot
I don't know about you.

24:52.645 --> 24:55.347
Like... the real reason
you dropped out of football?

24:56.816 --> 24:59.851
Beaver? What are you doing?

25:01.687 --> 25:04.256
- Avoiding the question.
- How bad could it be?

25:09.028 --> 25:11.296
The kt guys think it was
because I wanted to party.

25:11.330 --> 25:13.965
But the truth is...

25:15.234 --> 25:16.635
I wussed out.

25:16.669 --> 25:18.570
I was afraid I couldn't cut it.

25:18.604 --> 25:22.073
But that guy said you were
all-American in High School!

25:22.108 --> 25:24.676
So were a lot of them.
They made it look so easy.

25:24.710 --> 25:28.046
They could party all night and practice
all day and I couldn't really keep up.

25:28.080 --> 25:32.117
I know how you feel. My whole life
I could never keep up with rusty.

25:32.151 --> 25:34.085
I don't think rusty
is very good at football.

25:34.120 --> 25:37.289
Academically. I'd feel pretty
good about getting a "b",

25:37.323 --> 25:40.292
and then rusty would come along
and win the nobel prize.

25:40.326 --> 25:43.228
Now there's Katherine.
I feel like I'm drowning without a study group,

25:43.262 --> 25:48.600
and she's getting two degrees,
no sweat!

25:49.802 --> 25:51.303
Oh, speaking of
the genius-devil... hi.

25:51.337 --> 25:54.706
- Casey! Oh!
- Oh!

25:54.740 --> 25:56.574
Oh, you just taking
a little study break?

25:56.609 --> 26:00.612
That's right! I'm making good
progress, what about you?

26:00.646 --> 26:03.782
, I'm nearly done, so I thought
I'd take a little breather, too.

26:03.816 --> 26:07.385
We'll be breathing
at the Rio nightclub tonight

26:07.420 --> 26:08.887
- if you wanted to join us?
- Beaver, I don't think Katherine...

26:08.921 --> 26:11.256
The Rio nightclub?
I haven't heard of it.

26:11.290 --> 26:15.026
But the name conjures images
of relaxing with a caipirinha

26:15.061 --> 26:19.064
and some samba music after a long but worthy
day of volunteering in Brazilian slums.

26:19.098 --> 26:20.598
And I do speak
a bit of portugues.

26:20.633 --> 26:22.100
- Yeah you do.
- 'Course you do.

26:22.134 --> 26:24.769
- So, I'm in.
- Awesome!

26:33.048 --> 26:35.849
Laura, get more candles. The
ambient lighting in here sucks.

26:35.884 --> 26:38.385
I can't help it if some
of our pledges are washed out!

26:38.420 --> 26:40.955
Who comes to college
without a base tan?

26:46.461 --> 26:50.331
Oh! I forgot
how nicely you clean up.

26:50.365 --> 26:53.567
And I remember you don't
wear underwear with that dress.

26:53.602 --> 26:55.970
Oh! So...
Where's the fresh meat?

26:56.004 --> 26:57.371
Upstairs waiting
to be presented.

26:57.405 --> 27:00.441
And I assume you've started
an intra-campus gossip chain

27:00.475 --> 27:02.009
to insure Evan's arrival?

27:02.043 --> 27:04.578
You know me well.
Heather to heath to Calvin.

27:04.613 --> 27:07.281
Mmm. Hey, becks,
what I don't know is

27:07.315 --> 27:09.850
why you didn't just
tell him he had to come?

27:14.889 --> 27:18.292
Because I have somehow become the girl
who depends on a guy for happiness.

27:18.326 --> 27:20.861
Ah yes, you don't do needy.

27:20.895 --> 27:23.797
I'm starting to feel like an afterthought
to him and I just want his attention.

27:23.832 --> 27:25.499
Even if we're fighting.

27:25.533 --> 27:28.469
Anyway, thanks for
helping me out.

27:28.503 --> 27:29.903
I'm sure you have
better things to do.

27:29.938 --> 27:32.773
Me? Come on. It's not like
I'm in law school.

27:32.807 --> 27:35.809
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were
missing both of our lawyers-in-training.

27:35.844 --> 27:39.880
Please. Evan is lord of the
douche, no offense, and Casey...

27:39.914 --> 27:42.883
Uh-uh! I saw you studying
in kappa tau today.

27:42.917 --> 27:45.085
You're trying to impress her,
aren't you? Is it working?

27:45.120 --> 27:47.021
Well, considering
the last time she saw me,

27:47.055 --> 27:51.025
I was stoned and covered with
cheesarito dust, I'd say no.

27:51.059 --> 27:55.562
Ah! Looks like your psychosexual
tableau is about to play out, my lady.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.431
Ok, let's pretend to have a
really good time together.

27:57.465 --> 27:58.732
Ok.

27:58.767 --> 28:01.001
Oh, stop it, Cappie!
You're so funny.

28:01.036 --> 28:03.504
- Where do you come up with this stuff?
- Just anywhere I can.

28:03.538 --> 28:06.040
Evan! What are you doing
at pledge presents?

28:06.074 --> 28:08.709
Well, you proved
your point, Recca.

28:08.743 --> 28:10.844
Cappie, hit the road.

28:10.879 --> 28:13.080
Shouldn't you be
defending oil companies,

28:13.114 --> 28:14.648
or tobacco executives,

28:14.683 --> 28:17.751
or guys who cheated
on their Oscar-winning wives?

28:17.786 --> 28:20.754
The pledges are gathered and they look
as good as they're ever going to look.

28:20.789 --> 28:23.991
Ok, I have to start
the ceremony. You two behave!

28:50.251 --> 28:52.352
Must be ladies' night.

28:52.387 --> 28:55.089
I think they're focusing on
the Brazilian slum theme.

28:55.123 --> 28:58.859
Let me get you a drink, Katherine.
And you should find a table.

28:58.893 --> 29:00.594
Beaver, will you come help me?

29:01.563 --> 29:03.330
I'll sit next to you.

29:04.332 --> 29:06.767
Two sloe gin fizzes, please.

29:06.801 --> 29:08.402
What were you thinking,
inviting Katherine?

29:08.436 --> 29:10.604
I was thinking, that I'd really
like to get in her pants.

29:10.638 --> 29:12.206
You are not going
to get in her pants!

29:12.240 --> 29:14.942
She's not... like that,

29:14.976 --> 29:18.512
and anyway, the last person I want
here while I am buying case summaries

29:18.546 --> 29:21.281
is Katherine, the super-genius!

29:21.316 --> 29:23.951
Wait a minute!
That Katherine...

29:24.018 --> 29:27.354
Is that Katherine?
The smart one from law school?

29:27.388 --> 29:29.923
Have you been paying attention
to anything I've said all day?

29:29.958 --> 29:32.760
How should I know? I haven't been paying
attention to anything you've said all day.

29:32.794 --> 29:34.928
And I thought buying the case
summaries wasn't cheating!

29:34.963 --> 29:38.065
But it is pathetic.
And I don't want her to know.

29:38.099 --> 29:40.701
So I will distract her,
you find Dave,

29:40.735 --> 29:42.569
and then let's get out of here.

29:44.005 --> 29:48.709
A beer, please... wait! What I
meant was, I'm looking for Dave.

29:48.743 --> 29:51.779
Are you him? And a beer, please.

30:01.790 --> 30:04.491
Evening, officer.
Can you help me find Dave?

30:04.526 --> 30:06.093
Yeah, check over there.
He's up next.

30:06.127 --> 30:07.461
Thanks.

30:11.499 --> 30:12.666
Dave?

30:14.135 --> 30:17.437
- Beaver?
- Hey, I'm looking for Dave.

30:17.472 --> 30:22.176
<i>- Heath?! -Now, the star
attraction of wild wednesdays</i>

30:22.210 --> 30:24.511
<i>at the Rio nightclub!</i>

30:24.546 --> 30:27.281
<i>Fasten
your seat belts for a bumpy night.</i>

30:27.348 --> 30:32.753
<i>Ladies, it's sexy officer Dave!</i>

30:32.787 --> 30:36.223
<i>That's right...
It's Dave, and...</i>

30:37.959 --> 30:40.360
<i>...Goliath, ladies!</i>

30:44.132 --> 30:45.899
Are you Dave?
Are you a policeman?

30:45.934 --> 30:47.601
I'm so confused right now.

30:47.635 --> 30:50.304
Oh my God, is that heath?

30:54.008 --> 30:56.810
- Oh my God, they're stripping!
- Katherine, we can, we can, we can just go...

30:56.845 --> 31:00.747
No, no, it's interesting.
His moves are so fluid, much like a young nijinsky.

31:02.050 --> 31:03.817
Obviously we have
some things to discuss.

31:03.852 --> 31:06.086
But in addition to being
a stripper named Dave,

31:06.120 --> 31:07.821
are you also the guy
that sells the papers?

31:07.856 --> 31:09.957
Yes, ok? But I had
to shut down my service.

31:09.991 --> 31:12.526
A bunch of morons in modern lit
turned in the same paper.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.529
Who would do something so dumb?

31:15.563 --> 31:17.564
Well, can I just get
one thing for Casey?

31:17.599 --> 31:20.100
Yes, ok? We'll talk about
this later? I'm gonna get fired!

31:23.838 --> 31:25.873
Come on, beaver,
show us what you've got!

31:27.609 --> 31:29.409
That sloe gin fizz did not
live up to its name.

31:29.444 --> 31:30.777
It went to my head very quickly!

31:37.919 --> 31:39.620
You gotta take off
your shoes first!

31:48.830 --> 31:50.697
Yo!

31:53.334 --> 31:55.135
- Later, heath.
- You never saw me here!

31:55.737 --> 31:57.170
Hush money.

32:03.912 --> 32:06.280
Geez.

32:06.314 --> 32:09.016
This is really what girls do
after every fight with a guy?

32:09.050 --> 32:12.586
I've been known to pick a fight
just so I could eat like this.

32:26.935 --> 32:28.869
Hi.

32:30.204 --> 32:34.441
Hastings told me about
the project. Can we talk?

32:35.877 --> 32:37.945
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. You guys talk!

32:37.979 --> 32:40.614
I was just on my way to...

32:40.648 --> 32:43.150
Go look at some stars.

32:52.560 --> 32:56.129
I'm sorry I said what I said.

32:56.164 --> 32:58.065
But I do think
I deserve the credit.

32:58.099 --> 33:02.903
And I can't apologize for being confident in
my abilities, even if it makes you feel bad.

33:02.937 --> 33:06.106
Being confident is one thing,
but disparaging my work?

33:06.140 --> 33:08.909
- It's like you have no respect for me.
- That's not true.

33:08.943 --> 33:12.713
God, this is pointless. I really don't
want to start arguing about this again.

33:12.747 --> 33:17.017
Ok, but what does that mean?

33:17.051 --> 33:19.519
The project's over
for us anyway...

33:20.555 --> 33:22.589
Can we just move on?

33:35.636 --> 33:39.473
Pledge Tenley Truesdale,
with her escort, Bradley hunter.

33:43.177 --> 33:45.645
- Ok, seriously, why are you still here?
- Why do you care?

33:45.680 --> 33:48.215
- I thought you were done with
our little fights. - I am.

33:48.249 --> 33:50.751
- That's why I want you gone.
- Well, I refuse to be tossed aside

33:50.785 --> 33:54.087
like a pair of your old designer underpants.

33:54.122 --> 33:57.557
Pledge hee...
Heather robertson!

33:57.592 --> 33:59.626
Maybe you should
come up with a new shtick.

33:59.660 --> 34:02.429
I haven't accepted a dime from
my parents in over a year now.

34:02.463 --> 34:04.431
I'll throw you a parade.

34:04.465 --> 34:06.666
You can say what you want
about me, but the truth is,

34:06.701 --> 34:09.969
the only spoiled brat living
off his parents here is you.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.638
Hey!

34:16.143 --> 34:18.879
This has gone too far!

34:20.047 --> 34:21.947
I love college!

34:23.684 --> 34:26.585
- Ok, so we're all set! Ok?
- Yeah.

34:26.621 --> 34:29.389
Heath said you could buy those case summaries.
So can I have your paper now?

34:29.424 --> 34:30.891
- Beaver!
- What?

34:30.925 --> 34:32.826
You were gonna
buy case summaries?

34:32.860 --> 34:37.130
Yeah! Turns out heath is actually
Dave and he sells all this stuff!

34:37.165 --> 34:38.799
Oh! But don't tell anyone
he's a stripper.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.367
Beaver!

34:40.400 --> 34:42.268
What?

34:42.303 --> 34:44.804
Buy case summaries? That's,
that's interesting.

34:44.839 --> 34:48.574
'Cause I... I...

34:48.609 --> 34:52.245
- Yes...? - I'd really like to
see those case summaries, Casey

34:52.280 --> 34:54.114
because I lied.
I am not nearly done.

34:54.148 --> 34:56.349
I came tonight because I feared
I might have a panic attack

34:56.384 --> 34:57.684
if I didn't let off
a little steam.

34:57.718 --> 34:59.586
Seriously?
You've been panicking?

34:59.620 --> 35:02.355
Fifteen hundred pages
of reading, that is inhumane!

35:02.390 --> 35:04.524
How do you keep up with it?
Because I can't do it!

35:04.559 --> 35:06.693
I've always excelled
academically.

35:06.727 --> 35:08.228
Do you know
how hard that is, Casey?

35:08.262 --> 35:11.965
After today, I'm not even going
to graduate the jd/mba program,

35:11.999 --> 35:14.835
- much less excel!
- This is so great!

35:14.869 --> 35:19.139
I mean, not great since you've been
stressed, but it's great because...

35:19.173 --> 35:22.242
I have been
lying my ass off, too!

35:22.276 --> 35:25.512
Can we please, please, please
be in a study group together?

35:25.546 --> 35:28.315
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

35:29.650 --> 35:32.152
I'm so happy for you guys!

35:32.186 --> 35:34.387
So can I have that paper now,
Casey?

35:34.422 --> 35:38.291
Well, you've been so great
tonight...

35:42.964 --> 35:44.197
Do with it what you will.

35:46.434 --> 35:48.835
<i>"Themes of innocence
in to kill a mockingbird"?</i>

35:48.870 --> 35:50.871
I copied this paper already!

35:50.905 --> 35:54.174
- You cheated!
- I did not! I wrote that!

35:55.009 --> 35:56.776
Wait, that means that

35:56.811 --> 36:01.014
heath/dave took my paper and has
been selling it this whole time.

36:01.048 --> 36:04.751
- I guess you could take it as a compliment.
- Well, that is true, I guess...

36:04.785 --> 36:08.922
Hey. I am smart enough
for people to cheat off of.

36:08.956 --> 36:12.959
Hey, I'm totally screwed!
And so are the children!

36:19.404 --> 36:21.205
Can you look at me?

36:22.374 --> 36:25.543
I'm trying to apologize here.
I feel like a total idiot.

36:28.179 --> 36:29.446
You've been a total idiot,
starting with freaking out

36:30.815 --> 36:33.817
about beaver moving furniture.
You don't have to feel threatened by him.

36:34.085 --> 36:34.785
I know.

36:36.021 --> 36:37.721
You've also been an idiot about
going on and on about law school

36:39.124 --> 36:40.858
and being over college stuff, only
to get into the same dumb fight

36:42.027 --> 36:44.328
you've been having with cappie
since you were a freshman.

36:45.664 --> 36:48.265
Ever since you started law school,
you've been pulling away from me.

36:48.934 --> 36:50.467
I've been pulling away from you?

36:51.903 --> 36:56.407
Look, I mean, things have been kind of
hectic, but they're gonna calm down.

36:57.208 --> 36:58.275
Look, don't do this again,
Rebecca.

36:59.044 --> 37:00.377
Don't stir things up
and play games.

37:01.012 --> 37:02.980
We're past that, aren't we?

37:04.883 --> 37:07.551
You're right.

37:09.354 --> 37:10.821
I should have just told you I
really wanted you here tonight,

37:11.590 --> 37:12.890
and everything
would have been fine.

37:13.291 --> 37:15.225
Yes, exactly.

37:16.294 --> 37:20.898
So this has all just been
some unnecessary drama.

37:25.036 --> 37:28.172
- We're good?
- We're good.

37:28.406 --> 37:30.341
Ok.

37:38.883 --> 37:39.783
Hey.

37:41.119 --> 37:43.921
So what happened?
'Cause it turns out I suck at reading lips.

37:44.255 --> 37:45.823
We broke up.

37:46.157 --> 37:47.424
I'm sorry.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.128
And here I thought beaver
stepping on my model

37:52.197 --> 37:53.998
was gonna be the worst thing
that happened to me today.

37:54.833 --> 37:57.134
God, I hope Dana
was not right about me.

37:57.736 --> 37:58.035
What if I'm not good enough?

37:59.204 --> 38:01.772
The university obviously doesn't
trust me to finish the wire.

38:02.374 --> 38:03.207
Are you kidding?

38:04.509 --> 38:07.444
There wouldn't even be a wire if you
hadn't insulated a central core

38:08.179 --> 38:11.749
with a
compressible-hyper-whatever.

38:12.150 --> 38:14.118
Whatever-thing.

38:14.519 --> 38:15.919
You did that.

38:16.354 --> 38:17.921
You're amazing.

38:19.991 --> 38:21.859
Thanks.

38:34.673 --> 38:36.774
- Hey, Ash?
- Yeah?

38:37.676 --> 38:39.843
- Cash or check?
- What?

38:40.712 --> 38:43.147
The marketing fee?
The 60 bucks I owe you?

38:46.017 --> 38:46.917
A check will be fine.

38:47.719 --> 38:51.188
- Ok. I'll go get my checkbook.
- Ok.

38:59.731 --> 39:01.465
I feel so much better now that
Katherine and I are teaming up,

39:02.867 --> 39:07.304
<i>i think I can spare a night to talk
you through to kill a mockingbird.</i>

39:09.040 --> 39:11.809
You're my favorite lady I've
never had sex with, Casey.

39:12.110 --> 39:14.378
Aw, beav.

39:14.913 --> 39:16.246
So how long do we have?

39:16.915 --> 39:17.381
I have to turn it in by 9 A.M.

39:18.349 --> 39:19.883
Otherwise I get an "f",
and the children...

39:21.086 --> 39:23.787
Who are these children? Is this
some kt karmic synergy thing?

39:25.256 --> 39:28.692
No, I'm almost finished with my
five-year teaching certificate program.

39:29.894 --> 39:34.565
By the end of the year, I will
be a fully qualified teacher...

39:35.166 --> 39:36.633
Of kindergarten children.

39:38.603 --> 39:39.770
You are going to be a teacher?

39:40.438 --> 39:42.372
Yes. Judy boudreaux inspired me.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.174
She's my mom.
She's a drama teacher

39:45.176 --> 39:47.945
and she always told me
I could be whoever I wanted.

39:48.913 --> 39:51.615
She tells me
"I'm the star of my own show."

39:53.084 --> 39:55.652
Oh, hey, cap! You will never
guess what we found out tonight!

39:56.421 --> 39:59.022
- Heath is...
- Hey, no, no, no.

40:01.126 --> 40:04.361
- ...Gay!
- I know that, beav.

40:04.729 --> 40:06.997
Are you ok?

40:07.532 --> 40:09.967
- It's nothing.
- Oh.

40:11.836 --> 40:12.669
Bing?

40:13.571 --> 40:17.107
- Seriously?
- I don't want to talk about it.

40:21.913 --> 40:23.447
Why are cappie and Evan
still fighting?

40:24.415 --> 40:27.017
Can't they just put
their dumb male egos aside?

40:28.153 --> 40:29.353
I mean, do you think that
they can ever be friends again?

40:30.522 --> 40:35.058
- Nope. - Look, I know that
all you kts hate Evan...

40:36.027 --> 40:38.962
They can't ever be friends,
because of you.

40:40.098 --> 40:41.832
It's so much more
complicated than that.

40:42.834 --> 40:44.835
No it's not. They both fell
for the same girl.

40:45.770 --> 40:46.403
Everything that's happened
comes from that.

40:47.639 --> 40:51.608
No. There's blso Evan's money
that's always come between them.

40:52.443 --> 40:52.976
Evan doesn't have
any money anymore.

40:54.212 --> 40:56.980
And the prank that got Wade and
all the other kts kicked out...

40:58.449 --> 41:02.186
Bing only did that after he found out
you and cappie got back together.

41:03.288 --> 41:04.855
Are you sure you're
in law school?

41:05.690 --> 41:07.925
Because this is some
pretty basic stuff.

41:09.894 --> 41:12.563
But why is it
still going on now?

41:13.331 --> 41:17.100
I'm not with cappie
or Evan anymore.

41:17.702 --> 41:19.436
It's over.

41:21.973 --> 41:24.308
It's never over, case.

41:24.909 --> 41:26.343
That's pretty basic, too.

41:33.117 --> 41:36.386
You're a lot smarter
than people know, beav.

41:36.821 --> 41:39.289
Yeah... thanks.

41:40.391 --> 41:42.326
Do you think I'm smart enough
to write my own paper?

41:42.660 --> 41:44.461
Mmm... sure?

41:45.296 --> 41:48.932
Because I think
I owe it to my mom,

41:49.500 --> 41:50.834
and the children, to...

41:52.470 --> 41:56.406
<i>...Watch the movie version of to kill a
mockingbird and write the paper myself!</i>

41:57.508 --> 41:59.543
Good... good for you, beav.

42:00.578 --> 42:01.979
Good for the children.

42:10.889 --> 42:11.922
Hey, mom!

42:12.690 --> 42:13.991
I had the craziest dream
last night.

42:14.993 --> 42:18.295
Yeah, I was trapped inside
a giant cheesarito.

42:19.097 --> 42:20.364
I tried to eat my way out,
but I...

42:21.199 --> 42:23.066
Hold on.

42:25.169 --> 42:26.970
Lemme call you back.

42:33.411 --> 42:34.211
Good morning, pretty lady.

42:34.746 --> 42:36.880
Good morning, Walter.

42:37.415 --> 42:38.282
Can I call you Walter?

42:38.816 --> 42:41.218
You can call me anytime.

42:42.854 --> 42:45.589
I'm so glad that
I came back last night.

42:46.190 --> 42:46.957
Oh, I hope you don't mind,

42:48.559 --> 42:51.828
I just took the liberty of reading your
paper last night after you fell asleep.

42:52.196 --> 42:53.563
And it's...

42:54.565 --> 42:57.868
It's c-minus work, at best.

43:00.171 --> 43:02.539
- C-minus?
- Mm-hmm.

43:03.274 --> 43:04.708
Are you trying to
seduce me again?

43:05.209 --> 43:06.710
Because it's working.

43:07.679 --> 43:11.548
Lovely. I hear it's
even better the second time.

43:17.021 --> 43:18.956
I love my life.
