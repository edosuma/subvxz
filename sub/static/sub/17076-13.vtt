.

00:00.793 --> 00:02.427
Hey, have you heard
from antonio?

00:02.462 --> 00:03.194
No. Why?

00:03.230 --> 00:04.295
Laura dawson
just showed up here.

00:04.331 --> 00:07.499
You've never been married.
Stick to what you know.

00:07.534 --> 00:09.234
You didn't tell me
that your ex-wife was gonna

00:09.269 --> 00:10.502
Take your problems out on me.

00:10.537 --> 00:11.569
I really don't
need this right now.

00:11.605 --> 00:12.370
I got enough going on with her,

00:12.405 --> 00:13.771
And now i got to
hear it from you.

00:13.807 --> 00:16.508
You know what?
You're not ready, antonio.

00:17.744 --> 00:19.277
There's a battalion chief
position

00:19.312 --> 00:21.446
Open in springfield.
Yeah?

00:21.481 --> 00:23.381
<i>- You sure as hell know</i>
<i>how to do your job.</i>

00:23.416 --> 00:25.450
<i>I can tell the respect</i>
<i>you carry around.</i>

00:25.485 --> 00:27.452
And from what i hear,
there might be a girl

00:27.487 --> 00:28.853
<i>That you have something with.</i>

00:28.889 --> 00:32.223
We'd love to have you.
I'm guessing she would, too.

00:42.602 --> 00:44.969
Hey, sorry,
but we're closed.

00:45.005 --> 00:47.572
Yeah, i know.

00:53.914 --> 00:56.881
Hey, listen, buddy.

00:56.917 --> 00:58.983
I don't want any--
look...

00:59.019 --> 01:01.986
I know you're not
gonna believe me,

01:02.022 --> 01:05.323
But i have a job interview
at first national bank tomorrow.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.559
Congrats.

01:07.594 --> 01:11.262
The thing is...
I don't have a suit.

01:14.935 --> 01:18.603
I was hoping to borrow
a couple of hundred bucks

01:18.638 --> 01:21.573
To buy a new one.

01:21.608 --> 01:24.776
And what if i don't
lend you the money?

01:28.381 --> 01:30.982
I'm sorry about this.

01:31.017 --> 01:34.586
You're right.
Have a good night.

01:34.621 --> 01:36.621
Wait. Wait!

01:41.795 --> 01:43.728
What's going on?

01:47.367 --> 01:50.635
I just really need this job

01:50.670 --> 01:53.338
So i can get my own place,

01:53.373 --> 01:55.006
See my little girl more.

01:57.644 --> 02:00.578
Ugly divorce,
you know?

02:33.546 --> 02:35.847
Good luck.

02:47.394 --> 02:48.993
You know you're never gonna
see that money again, right?

02:49.029 --> 02:51.996
Of course!
Give me a little credit.

02:52.032 --> 02:53.831
So, you don't mind
getting scammed?

02:53.867 --> 02:56.067
It's only getting scammed
if i believed his story,

02:56.102 --> 02:58.403
Which i didn't.

02:58.438 --> 03:00.004
'tis better to give
than receive.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.839
Exactly.
Said every sucker

03:01.875 --> 03:04.008
In the history of the world.
Mm.

03:04.044 --> 03:06.511
Hey, as long as it's coming
out of your cut.

03:06.546 --> 03:08.913
Hey.
Trust me.

03:08.948 --> 03:10.948
I did a good thing, okay?

03:10.984 --> 03:13.351
Whatever he's using
that money for,

03:13.386 --> 03:16.387
He needed a helping hand.

03:16.423 --> 03:19.724
I helped him.
Drugs. Using it for drugs.

03:22.629 --> 03:23.761
Hey.

03:23.797 --> 03:25.463
Look, i got your text
last night,

03:25.498 --> 03:26.864
But i didn't see it
till this morning.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.566
Oh, it's nothing.

03:29.636 --> 03:32.737
Look, i know
it wasn't a booty call,

03:32.772 --> 03:35.740
So what did you want
to talk about?

03:39.112 --> 03:42.046
I got a job offer.
In the cfd?

03:42.082 --> 03:45.416
Battalion chief
in the city of springfield.

03:46.786 --> 03:48.586
Huh.

03:49.489 --> 03:50.888
Stella?
Yeah?

03:50.924 --> 03:53.591
Um, i need you.

03:56.596 --> 03:57.929
We're not done.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.966
Hey.
Hey, what's up?

04:08.508 --> 04:09.907
Hey, brett?

04:09.943 --> 04:12.744
Honey, what's going on?

04:12.779 --> 04:14.545
Maybe i could stand
to be in better shape.

04:15.949 --> 04:18.182
Maybe you two could encourage me
instead of gawking at me

04:18.218 --> 04:21.853
Like a couple of bitches.

04:52.652 --> 04:55.620
Chief, what do we got?

04:55.655 --> 04:57.622
Just hang back
in case i need you.

04:57.657 --> 04:59.724
You heard him.
Hang back.

04:59.759 --> 05:01.125
Get the hurst in there.

05:01.161 --> 05:03.895
Let's do this nice and easy.

05:24.184 --> 05:25.583
I see her!

05:25.618 --> 05:27.185
128, get ready.

05:28.855 --> 05:30.188
Nice and easy.

05:32.792 --> 05:36.160
Chief!
Tell your men to hold off.

05:36.196 --> 05:37.829
Clock's ticking.

05:37.864 --> 05:40.665
No. Stop lifting.
Stop lifting now!

05:40.700 --> 05:41.699
We got her.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.267
no!

05:50.225 --> 05:50.257

05:55.865 --> 05:57.331
That top pipe is not secure.

05:57.366 --> 06:00.334
81, grab some webbing.
Secure that pipe.

06:00.369 --> 06:01.902
Copy that.

06:11.113 --> 06:13.948
Come on. Let's go.

06:13.983 --> 06:16.951

06:27.196 --> 06:29.997
You got it?
We're good.

06:30.032 --> 06:31.632
Not sure how long
it'll hold it.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.168
Chief anderson,
we're clear.

06:35.238 --> 06:37.438
You heard him, 128.
Let's get her out.

06:37.473 --> 06:38.973
Quickly.

06:45.014 --> 06:46.614
Seatbelt.

06:46.649 --> 06:47.982
Turn around.

06:58.528 --> 07:00.361
Hey, wait.
Easy.

07:00.396 --> 07:04.031
Got her?
Set her down.

07:04.066 --> 07:05.666
Okay, we got her.

07:08.070 --> 07:09.537
Everybody back up.
Come on. Okay, guys. Clear.

07:09.572 --> 07:11.539
Clear.
All right, back out of there.

07:11.574 --> 07:14.074
Back out. Back out.
Okay.

07:14.110 --> 07:16.143
Everybody clear?
You can let it go.

07:30.393 --> 07:32.526
Pack it up and clean it up, 81.

07:32.562 --> 07:35.329
All right, let's go.
Good work.

07:45.942 --> 07:48.075
Hey.
Hey, herrmann.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.610
You chalmers and kolvair
from headquarters, right?

07:49.645 --> 07:52.212
No, i don't believe i have.
Hey.

07:52.248 --> 07:54.048
How are you? Hey, bud.
All right, so, uh,

07:54.083 --> 07:55.716
This is really weird...
Yeah?

07:55.751 --> 07:59.086
But they just got an email
from a nigerian prince,

07:59.121 --> 08:00.321
And they were wondering
if they can get

08:00.356 --> 08:03.257
Your banking routing number
so that they can make a deposit.

08:06.395 --> 08:08.262
He put you up to this?

08:08.297 --> 08:10.197
Yeah.

08:10.232 --> 08:11.465
Nice friend.

08:12.501 --> 08:16.370
Hey, chalmers, kolvair,
you got my o2 tanks?

08:16.405 --> 08:18.305
It's right inside, chief.
Thanks.

08:18.341 --> 08:21.108
Hey, you missed a crazy call.
Boden saved anderson's ass.

08:21.143 --> 08:24.478
Wait. Deputy district chief
anderson?

08:24.513 --> 08:25.946
Well, it wasn't nothing,
really.

08:25.982 --> 08:27.381
I'm just glad i caught it
when i did.

08:27.416 --> 08:29.950
Still, would've been blood
on the pavement.

08:29.986 --> 08:32.219
Ah, enough of that.

08:32.254 --> 08:34.622
Let's get inside,
get some lunch going.

08:34.657 --> 08:36.190
Thanks, boys.

08:39.362 --> 08:43.297
Springfield, huh?
Yeah.

08:43.332 --> 08:46.333
Isn't that where anna lives?

08:46.369 --> 08:48.268
That's not what this is about.

08:48.304 --> 08:51.138
Oh, right, right,
you just got tired

08:51.173 --> 08:53.107
Of the hustle and bustle
of chicago

08:53.142 --> 08:55.476
And figured you'd move
to the countryside

08:55.511 --> 08:56.977
And raise some chickens.

08:57.013 --> 09:00.614
Springfield is the sixth
largest city in illinois.

09:05.688 --> 09:08.355
You're actually
considering this.

09:08.391 --> 09:09.990
Yeah.

09:10.026 --> 09:12.493
I'm gonna go visit.
I think the smart thing to do

09:12.528 --> 09:14.395
Would be to see
what they're offering.

09:15.564 --> 09:17.631
So, why are you asking
my opinion?

09:19.068 --> 09:21.168
Because you're my friend.

09:21.203 --> 09:22.503
I care what you think.

09:25.541 --> 09:27.508
I think...

09:27.543 --> 09:29.543
Ten minutes in springfield,

09:29.578 --> 09:33.614
You'll be hightailing it back
to chicago as fast as you can.

09:33.649 --> 09:37.317
Or i just don't know you at all.

09:42.825 --> 09:45.459
You wanted to see us?

09:45.494 --> 09:49.363
Yeah.
I have three questions.

09:49.398 --> 09:51.799
Are you going to
kenny fallwell's cocktail party?

09:51.834 --> 09:54.134
If so, are your wives going?

09:54.170 --> 09:56.103
And what are they wearing?

09:57.406 --> 09:59.206
You wrote those down?

09:59.241 --> 10:02.209
I just hung up with donna.
She wanted me to ask.

10:02.244 --> 10:05.245
Well, yes, yes,

10:05.281 --> 10:09.550
And we will have
cindy and trudy text her.

10:09.585 --> 10:12.586
Mission accomplished.
Yeah.

10:12.621 --> 10:14.688
I do have one more thing.

10:14.724 --> 10:18.092
Let's keep a lid on what
happened at the sewer pipe call.

10:18.127 --> 10:19.693
Chief anderson
just got that promotion

10:19.729 --> 10:24.398
And he's a little...
Sensitive about his image.

10:24.433 --> 10:26.200
You got it, chief.

10:27.236 --> 10:28.569
Thanks.

10:30.806 --> 10:33.173
I saw some makeup tutorials
online.

10:33.209 --> 10:35.409
I'm thinking
about making some changes.

10:35.444 --> 10:37.611
Maybe some smoky eyes
or something.

10:37.646 --> 10:38.612
Okay.

10:38.647 --> 10:40.414
I saw on the side of facebook
there are these

10:40.449 --> 10:42.116
Professional makeup classes
you can take if--

10:42.151 --> 10:43.517
I think those are
if you want to work

10:43.552 --> 10:45.519
In the movies or something.

10:47.590 --> 10:50.591
Hey, you guys okay?

10:50.626 --> 10:51.892
Yeah, why?

10:51.927 --> 10:53.761
Heard about
this new big-shot chief

10:53.796 --> 10:55.462
Nearly got you all killed.

10:55.498 --> 10:58.132
Who said that?
It's going around.

10:58.167 --> 11:00.200
Cfd gossips more than nurses,

11:00.236 --> 11:01.301
Which i didn't think
was possible.

11:02.338 --> 11:04.805
<i>- Main to 61,</i>
<i>are you available?</i>

11:04.840 --> 11:06.640

11:14.650 --> 11:16.884
It's an office party
for their ceo.

11:16.919 --> 11:18.886
For the record,
no one told us.

11:20.356 --> 11:23.323

11:29.665 --> 11:31.732
She's tacky. About 140.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.634
just so you
know, this is a one-time deal.

11:33.669 --> 11:35.903
We don't condone
this type of party at all.

11:35.938 --> 11:37.805
And yet here we are.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.274
Let's roll her over gently.
Yeah.

11:42.678 --> 11:44.678
Can you hear me, sweetie?

11:44.713 --> 11:45.946
What's her name?

11:45.981 --> 11:48.448
I believe she was going
by lucky.

11:51.487 --> 11:52.920
Can you hear me, lucky?

11:55.357 --> 11:57.457
She's responding to pain.
Pupils are dilated.

11:57.493 --> 12:01.528
Did she do any coke?
Snort something?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.667
Let's push narcan.
Yeah.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.977
Hey.
Hey, can you hear me?

12:17.012 --> 12:19.413
My chest hurts.

12:21.350 --> 12:24.518
Whoa. Hold her.
Yup.

12:29.791 --> 12:29.824
.

12:31.928 --> 12:33.628
Easy. Easy.

12:34.931 --> 12:37.899
<i></i>

12:45.708 --> 12:47.241
Narcan wakes her,

12:47.277 --> 12:49.343
And then she goes
into cardiac arrhythmia?

12:49.379 --> 12:51.646
All right, i need to know
right now if she took something.

12:53.383 --> 12:55.917
Spit it out!

12:55.952 --> 12:58.052
I saw a dude in the bathroom
giving her a speedball.

13:00.123 --> 13:01.822
We need to cardiovert her.

13:09.132 --> 13:12.199
[machine continues
to beep rapidly]

13:13.236 --> 13:15.002
Charging at 100.
Clear.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.879
Sinus rhythm.

13:29.452 --> 13:31.252
I want to go home.

13:31.287 --> 13:33.788
You're gonna be okay, honey.
We got you.

13:38.795 --> 13:40.761
Here. For your troubles.

13:42.265 --> 13:44.665
Men suck.

13:49.272 --> 13:51.138
What are you doing?

13:51.174 --> 13:54.275
In mouch's haste to get to his
stash of peanut butter m&ms,

13:54.310 --> 13:55.943
He broke the cabinet door.

13:55.979 --> 13:57.445
Ah-ha.

14:01.184 --> 14:02.917
Hey, i know you got
the alderman thing,

14:02.952 --> 14:06.320
And that pretty much
keeps your hands full,

14:06.356 --> 14:08.155
But you ever wanna be a chief?

14:08.191 --> 14:12.660
Not gunning for it,
but down the road, sure.

14:12.695 --> 14:13.961
You?

14:13.997 --> 14:16.163
I don't know.
Lot of responsibility.

14:16.199 --> 14:18.432
Yeah, we're learning
from one of the greats.

14:18.468 --> 14:21.335
Anytime i see boden step in
with a split-second decision

14:21.371 --> 14:24.839
Like he did today,
reacting like that.

14:24.874 --> 14:26.307
Will you hold this up for me?

14:29.212 --> 14:30.811
Why are you asking?

14:30.847 --> 14:33.714
Just thinking
about the future.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.784
That's how you get
in trouble.

14:36.819 --> 14:38.352
Tell me about it.

14:40.523 --> 14:43.491
<i></i>

14:49.866 --> 14:51.032
The hell are you doing?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.867
Nothing.

14:52.902 --> 14:54.368
I thought i would learn
a new language,

14:54.404 --> 14:56.203
Just 'cause it might be useful.

14:56.239 --> 14:59.173
German is useful...
In chicago?

15:00.910 --> 15:04.378
Well...
Brett, what's going on?

15:04.414 --> 15:08.049
Okay, look. I am batting
about a zero with men lately.

15:08.084 --> 15:10.718
Good men, bad men,
all men.

15:10.753 --> 15:12.987
I'm either pushing them away,
or they're pushing me,

15:13.022 --> 15:14.221
And then i look at you,
and i think,

15:14.257 --> 15:17.892
"wow,
what she has is perfect."

15:17.927 --> 15:20.494
You know how many guys i had
to date before i met casey?

15:20.530 --> 15:23.497
There was jake,
who cheated on me

15:23.533 --> 15:25.900
With his high school girlfriend,

15:25.935 --> 15:30.004
And logan, whose parents could
not approve of a latino.

15:30.039 --> 15:32.339
And finally dr. Mike.

15:32.375 --> 15:35.242
He was about as romantic
as a german teacher.

15:35.278 --> 15:38.379
Look,
the point is there were a lot

15:38.414 --> 15:41.882
Of really bad breakups
before casey.

15:43.319 --> 15:46.020
Your casey is out there,

15:46.055 --> 15:48.322
But you don't have to change
who you are to find him.

15:50.927 --> 15:52.393
Okay.

15:56.933 --> 15:59.934
How is antonio?

15:59.969 --> 16:02.570
Not so great,
from what i can tell.

16:02.605 --> 16:06.574
stay close,
make sure he's all right?

16:07.977 --> 16:10.044
Of course.

16:13.483 --> 16:15.816
Whatever.
Hey, do you guys want

16:15.852 --> 16:17.318
To come over
for a movie marathon?

16:17.353 --> 16:19.220
We're gonna watch
"the sting,"

16:19.255 --> 16:21.122
Uh, "spanish prisoner"...

16:21.157 --> 16:24.225
Ooh, thomas crown.
"thomas crown affair."

16:24.260 --> 16:26.494
I know you're making fun
of me, i just don't know how.

16:26.529 --> 16:27.962
They're all con movies.

16:27.997 --> 16:31.432
Ah. You know,
instead, maybe...

16:31.467 --> 16:33.467
You should read
"the giving tree."

16:33.503 --> 16:36.303
It's a very sweet story
about a tree

16:36.339 --> 16:38.572
That gives away
all of its branches.

16:38.608 --> 16:40.474
What happens to the tree?

16:40.510 --> 16:43.110
Uh, it gets cut down
to just a stump.

16:43.146 --> 16:46.180
That's horrible.
It's a lesson!

16:46.215 --> 16:49.817
Don't be a sucker?

16:49.852 --> 16:52.353
You, too, now?
You know what? Forget it.

16:52.388 --> 16:56.557
You know, me and my giving heart
will see you later.

16:57.527 --> 16:59.426
Hey.

16:59.462 --> 17:01.829
<i>- Boden?</i>
Yeah?

17:01.864 --> 17:03.964
Chief,
what can i do for you?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.467
You've been talking about me
behind my back.

17:06.502 --> 17:07.668
Come again?

17:07.703 --> 17:10.137
There's scuttlebutt going
all over the cfd that you had to

17:10.173 --> 17:13.207
Jump in and save my ass
on that last call.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.476
I have discussed the call
with others, yes,

17:15.511 --> 17:18.546
But i certainly didn't say
anything disparaging about you.

17:18.581 --> 17:21.215
It's true what they say
about you, isn't it?

17:21.250 --> 17:23.450
You're a real wild card.

17:23.486 --> 17:26.020
No respect
for the chain of command.

17:26.055 --> 17:27.621
Looks who's trading
in scuttlebutt.

17:27.657 --> 17:28.756
You see something on a scene,

17:28.791 --> 17:30.891
You bring it to the attention
of the incident commander.

17:30.927 --> 17:32.626
There wasn't time.
There wasn't time?

17:32.662 --> 17:35.529
Or you just decided you could
handle it better than me?

17:35.565 --> 17:37.231
Maybe you thought
you should've got the bump

17:37.266 --> 17:38.933
For deputy district chief.

17:41.504 --> 17:45.139
Chief, you have every right
to be upset,

17:45.174 --> 17:47.074
But i didn't intend
to undercut your authority.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.077
I had a different vantage point.
I saw something.

17:50.112 --> 17:53.948
I acted.
Simple as that.

17:56.953 --> 18:00.154
You don't want to make
an enemy out of me, chief.

18:03.426 --> 18:06.227
We are in agreement.

18:20.683 --> 18:20.715
.

18:20.816 --> 18:23.151
Think there's gonna be
any fallout from anderson?

18:23.186 --> 18:25.320
I'm hoping he got it all
out of his system,

18:25.355 --> 18:27.489
But then again,
he can be tricky.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.658
Got a very fragile ego.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.493
For good reason.
Did you remind him

18:31.528 --> 18:34.362
That he almost got
some firefighters killed?

18:34.398 --> 18:36.498
You know that's not
how i operate.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.365
Sometimes when you're a chief,

18:37.401 --> 18:41.269
You just got to suck it up
and nod yes.

18:41.305 --> 18:44.172
Doesn't sound much different
than when you're a lieutenant.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.207
Maybe not.

18:46.243 --> 18:47.976
See you, kelly.
See you.

18:51.682 --> 18:54.683
<i></i>

19:55.946 --> 20:00.949
That is the scott x3
snap-change scba

20:00.984 --> 20:03.385
With the sight mask.

20:03.420 --> 20:06.354
Every firefighter gets a new one
every year.

20:06.390 --> 20:08.289
They're nice.

20:08.325 --> 20:11.926
So is the pay
and the furlough time.

20:11.962 --> 20:14.562
I know you can see the rigs
are all top-of-the-line.

20:14.598 --> 20:16.531
Now all i need is
a new battalion chief

20:16.566 --> 20:17.966
To take us to the next level.

20:18.001 --> 20:19.768
Ah, the hard sell.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.770
We want to make springfield
the best fire department

20:21.805 --> 20:23.071
In the world.

20:23.106 --> 20:25.440
And i got 300 firefighters
who believe it.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.744
Hey, come on.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.080
Let me introduce you
to some of the guys.

20:51.968 --> 20:53.068
Yes?

20:53.103 --> 20:54.469
What was that alderman's name

20:54.504 --> 20:56.571
From the breakfast thing
we did last month?

20:56.606 --> 20:59.808
Uh, there were 30 aldermen.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.743
The tall one
with the cute hair.

21:01.778 --> 21:03.411
Cute hair?

21:03.447 --> 21:05.780
Kyle something?

21:05.816 --> 21:06.815
Uh, he said he was single,

21:06.850 --> 21:10.652
And i thought maybe we could
set him up with brett.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.088
Well, probably not
the best idea

21:13.123 --> 21:15.523
To mix my government work
with someone from the firehouse.

21:15.559 --> 21:18.827
Yeah. No, no.
You're right. You're right.

21:22.799 --> 21:24.833
What about that waiter
from the restaurant tuscany?

21:24.868 --> 21:25.934
The young one they just hired.

21:25.969 --> 21:28.703
What are you doing?

21:28.739 --> 21:30.004
she was with my brother,

21:30.040 --> 21:32.974
And she's not really
taking this well,

21:33.009 --> 21:36.010
And i want to help.

21:36.046 --> 21:40.348
Okay, i'm gonna get up,
go to the fridge, get a beer,

21:40.383 --> 21:42.383
Come back, and watch hockey.

21:42.419 --> 21:44.819
At no point in this
am i gonna talk any more

21:44.855 --> 21:47.655
About brett's love life.
Got it.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.534
They seem great.
Yeah.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.369
They're smoke eaters,
every one of them.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.837
Yeah, i can tell.

22:04.107 --> 22:06.174
So, you'd have
about 40 to 45 firefighters

22:06.209 --> 22:07.709
Under your direct command.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.411
How you command is up to you.

22:10.447 --> 22:12.714
You want to run into burning
buildings, you still do that.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.983
You want to hang back and call
your shots from the street,

22:15.018 --> 22:17.719
That's your decision.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.155
And then i want to throw this
on top of the cake.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.628
That's your official offer,
including compensation.

22:31.434 --> 22:35.170
Wow.
Look, think about it, okay?

22:35.205 --> 22:36.938
I'm gonna run to my office,
check on a few things,

22:36.973 --> 22:38.873
Give you some time.

22:38.909 --> 22:41.109
Yeah, i'm just gonna get out
and check out the city.

22:41.144 --> 22:43.178
Talk to you later.
Yeah.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.955
<i>- I'll tell you what, augie.</i>
<i>I will bet you $1 million</i>

22:53.990 --> 22:55.924
<i>That i will beat you this time.</i>

22:55.959 --> 22:59.093
<i>-  you don't have</i>
<i>a million dollars.</i>

22:59.129 --> 23:00.929
You don't know that
unless you play with me,

23:00.964 --> 23:03.097
So bring it on, kid.

23:03.133 --> 23:06.768
who's that?

23:17.147 --> 23:21.516
Ah, that is...Mr. Cool.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.957
What the hell are you doing
in springfield?

23:28.992 --> 23:31.960
You said someday.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.562
Today is someday somewhere.

23:34.598 --> 23:38.032
I've thought about you
every day.

23:39.970 --> 23:41.803
I've thought about calling you.

23:41.838 --> 23:45.673
I would've loved that.
Kelly...

23:45.709 --> 23:48.676
I mean, i will be
forever grateful

23:48.712 --> 23:50.645
For what you did for me.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.748
I mean, this is my life, here.

23:59.723 --> 24:02.123
I have a job offer

24:02.158 --> 24:04.826
To run my own battalion
here in springfield.

24:06.296 --> 24:09.264
You're kidding.
No.

24:09.299 --> 24:12.267
<i></i>

24:13.336 --> 24:17.171
Please don't do this for me.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.607
I mean, i would love the chance
to get to know you better,

24:19.643 --> 24:21.876
But if i thought that you were
giving up chicago for me--

24:21.912 --> 24:25.079
oh, stop doing that, please.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.184
Well, i mean, not, like--
not yet, you know.

24:42.165 --> 24:46.868
If i do this,
it'll be for the right reasons.

24:47.837 --> 24:49.604
What are those?

24:51.207 --> 24:54.776
That's what i'm trying
to figure out.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.214
So, we grabbed
all the gear we could,

25:00.250 --> 25:01.816
And we hiked it up the stairs
ourselves.

25:01.851 --> 25:03.217
Yeah, eh, here we go.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.285
Now christopher's
the first one up.

25:04.321 --> 25:07.088
I was bringing up the rear.
Yeah, as usual.

25:07.123 --> 25:08.723
wait, i have heard this story.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.558
You said the candidate had
to carry all the gear.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.060
Oh, wouldn't that be nice.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.728
Yeah, well,
actually what i said was--

25:13.763 --> 25:16.698
Don't--don't believe a word
this guy says.

25:17.901 --> 25:19.834
Hey, jim.
Good to see you, too.

25:19.869 --> 25:21.336
That's not what you were
saying earlier today

25:21.371 --> 25:23.071
When i was chewing you
a new one.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.375
No, not at the time.
No.

25:27.410 --> 25:29.744
Uh, i thought we were
all good, jim.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.947
You damaged my reputation.

25:32.983 --> 25:34.882
I went through a hell of a lot
to get that promotion,

25:34.918 --> 25:35.984
Crawled a lot of hallways.

25:36.019 --> 25:38.619
I know that, chief.
So, no, we're not all good

25:38.655 --> 25:40.722
When someone lower in command
tries to tell me

25:40.757 --> 25:42.390
How to run a rescue.
Okay.

25:42.425 --> 25:45.593
When your house is the one
with all the problems.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.596

25:48.631 --> 25:51.933
I pulled your file, wallace.
I see how you manage your house.

25:51.968 --> 25:53.768
Just this year,
you got a candidate

25:53.803 --> 25:55.403
Filing a complaint against you,

25:55.438 --> 25:57.238
One of your men was arrested
for hit-and-run,

25:57.273 --> 25:59.273
And then you go
and get suspended

25:59.309 --> 26:00.942
For conduct unbecoming.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.744
Now, you add
gross insubordination

26:02.779 --> 26:04.412
To that list,

26:04.447 --> 26:06.214
That could be the end
of your career.

26:06.249 --> 26:07.115
Excuse me?

26:07.150 --> 26:09.217
This is supposed
to be a party, guys.

26:12.322 --> 26:15.289
We should probably go.
Yeah? Why's that?

26:15.325 --> 26:17.959
Hey, jim.
Chief...

26:17.994 --> 26:20.395
How are you gonna like it
when i describe in detail

26:20.430 --> 26:24.399
And on record
how firefighters nearly died

26:24.434 --> 26:26.200
Due to your negligence?

26:34.778 --> 26:36.811
Wallace...

26:39.349 --> 26:41.649
No, it's all good.

26:50.484 --> 26:50.516

has her teeth cleaning.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.520
She can't be late.
What? They're baby teeth.

26:54.556 --> 26:57.924
They're gonna fall out anyway.
Uh, dad, pass the butter?

26:57.959 --> 27:00.426
Please?
Please.

27:00.461 --> 27:02.762
Who's picking up max
from hockey practice today? Hm?

27:02.797 --> 27:05.298
I can. Oh--
oh, wait, no i can't,

27:05.333 --> 27:06.332
Because i don't have a car.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.768
Get some straight as,
then come talk to me.

27:08.803 --> 27:11.604
Christopher.
Don't forget my class.

27:11.639 --> 27:13.272
What class?

27:13.308 --> 27:14.941
You're dad of the week,
remember?

27:14.976 --> 27:17.443
He signed you up.

27:17.478 --> 27:19.912
Ohh, yeah, hey, buddy,

27:19.948 --> 27:21.380
I didn't know that,

27:21.416 --> 27:23.282
You know, we landed
on a date

27:23.318 --> 27:25.418
And i got to work.

27:25.453 --> 27:28.754
You know, you've heard most
of my fire stories.

27:28.790 --> 27:31.724
The other kids haven't.

27:31.759 --> 27:34.827
Hmm.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.763
Boy,
i'm just letting people down

Left and right these days.
Hey...

27:45.673 --> 27:48.608
Hey.
Hey.

27:48.643 --> 27:49.742
How'd it go?

27:49.777 --> 27:51.744
Did you know they have
an actual drive-in movie theater

27:51.779 --> 27:55.581
In springfield, along route 66?

27:55.617 --> 27:56.582
And the fire department?

27:56.618 --> 27:59.518
They're trying
to build something good there.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.854
It's a decent offer.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.623
Okay, look,

28:03.658 --> 28:06.492
Kelly, you barely know
this woman.

28:06.527 --> 28:08.628
I told you
it's not all about her.

28:08.663 --> 28:10.463
Okay, then what is it about?

28:13.868 --> 28:17.470
Oh, lately i've been
staring in the mirror a lot,

28:17.505 --> 28:19.805
And every day,
the person looking back

28:19.841 --> 28:21.641
Looks more and more like benny,

28:21.676 --> 28:25.711
And i don't want that future.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.848
Maybe this is the chance
i've been looking for.

28:28.883 --> 28:30.950
Okay.

28:35.023 --> 28:38.491
But if you go, i'll miss you.

28:38.526 --> 28:41.961
'cause like you said,
we're friends,

28:41.996 --> 28:44.897
And, um...

28:44.932 --> 28:46.799
We're good together.

28:56.911 --> 28:59.745
Hey, did i hear
that chief and anderson

28:59.781 --> 29:01.881
Went toe-to-toe
at kenny fallwell's place?

29:01.916 --> 29:04.083
That's kind of a dramatic way
to put it.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.885
Everything i hear,
anderson is somebody

29:05.920 --> 29:08.788
You don't want to mess with.
Neither is our chief.

29:10.058 --> 29:12.491
Uh, can we talk
about something else?

29:12.527 --> 29:13.659
What are you
so sensitive about?

29:13.695 --> 29:15.728
What, did you loan anderson
a couple hundred bucks, too?

29:19.967 --> 29:23.469
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, it was funny.

29:31.045 --> 29:33.913
"don't beat yourself up."
it's my new motto.

29:33.948 --> 29:36.682
You're obviously
not catholic.

29:36.718 --> 29:39.418
Hey, lieutenant, um,

29:39.454 --> 29:41.587
Is it okay if we go for a ride?

29:41.622 --> 29:43.222
It's kind of important.

29:45.159 --> 29:46.759
We've had
a change of schedule,

29:46.794 --> 29:49.929
So we can spend more time
on fractions.

29:49.964 --> 29:52.198
Ah, not so fast.

29:52.233 --> 29:54.467
Dad!
What? You didn't think

29:54.502 --> 29:56.602
I was gonna make it
to super-duper dad day?

29:56.637 --> 29:58.904
Come on.
May i go?

29:58.940 --> 30:00.239
Yes.
All right.

30:00.274 --> 30:02.141
Come on.
Okay.

30:02.176 --> 30:05.478
Hey, you guys want to learn
about firefighting?

30:05.513 --> 30:07.480
Yeah!

30:07.515 --> 30:10.750
Okay.
Who knows what this is?

30:10.785 --> 30:13.052
Ah, besides my handsome,
young son there.

30:13.087 --> 30:14.787
Yes, bright young lady?

30:14.822 --> 30:16.589
It's a gas detector,

30:16.624 --> 30:19.125
For, like, toxic smoke
you can't see.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.761
Darn close!
You know, we definitely have

30:21.796 --> 30:23.496
A device that can detect gas,

30:23.531 --> 30:25.631
And the thing goes off
all the time

30:25.666 --> 30:27.800
On hot chili night.

30:29.837 --> 30:32.638
This actually is
a thermal imaging camera.

30:32.673 --> 30:34.673
Anybody knows what this does?

30:34.709 --> 30:36.475
Yes?
Detects heat?

30:36.511 --> 30:38.244
Exactly right.
Check this out.

30:38.279 --> 30:41.080
All right, look.
There's your teacher!

30:41.115 --> 30:44.016
Doesn't it look crazy?
See it? See that?

30:44.051 --> 30:46.652
What's it mean
when there's a four-alarm fire?

30:46.687 --> 30:48.154
You know,
that's a great question,

30:48.189 --> 30:50.022
And the lieutenant here
can answer that one.

30:50.057 --> 30:51.991
Yeah, it means
the more alarms,

30:52.026 --> 30:54.693
The more vehicles
and firefighters responding.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.129
One time,
a kid pulled the fire alarm

30:57.165 --> 30:59.632
And the whole fire department
came.

30:59.667 --> 31:02.001
Ooh.
You know what?

31:02.036 --> 31:04.770
This is the thing

31:04.806 --> 31:08.607
As firefighters, we don't know
whether or not it is false,

31:08.643 --> 31:13.279
So we need to assume
that it's real,

31:13.314 --> 31:15.147
And we have to go
help the people

31:15.183 --> 31:17.016
Even though those people may be

31:17.051 --> 31:20.219
Just playing some big,
dumb joke.

31:20.254 --> 31:23.656
See, we always help people,

31:23.691 --> 31:25.758
Whether they deserve it or not.

31:42.877 --> 31:46.579
What is this?
Routine inspection.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.314
Those floor drains
been cleaned out lately?

31:48.349 --> 31:51.050
I'll have a look.

31:51.085 --> 31:53.986
Is this how
you're playing it now, jim?

31:54.021 --> 31:56.021
Your ego is so bruised,
you're gonna dig around

31:56.057 --> 31:57.790
Till you find something else?

31:59.794 --> 32:01.227
Where are you coming from,
lieutenant?

32:01.262 --> 32:03.229
I didn't hear any calls for 81.

32:03.264 --> 32:07.166
Carmichael elementary,
doing a demonstration.

32:07.201 --> 32:09.034
You file paperwork for that?

32:11.639 --> 32:13.706
On my way to do it now.

32:28.089 --> 32:28.954
Help you, chief?

32:28.990 --> 32:31.624
As you were.
Pretend we're not here.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.926
Jim, will you step
into my office?

32:33.961 --> 32:36.929
I'll get there in due time.

32:36.964 --> 32:39.632
<i></i>

32:39.667 --> 32:41.267

<i>Man down from unknown causes.</i>
<i>341 west...</i>

32:43.838 --> 32:45.905
When i get back,
we are gonna talk.

32:47.141 --> 32:49.808
We'll come with you.

32:49.844 --> 32:52.912
<i></i>

33:19.941 --> 33:21.740
What's going on?
Our friend calvin was trying

33:21.776 --> 33:23.976
To jump up and pull down
a fire escape ladder.

33:24.011 --> 33:26.111
He grabbed it, but it,
like, shot down on him.

33:26.147 --> 33:27.813
Okay.
People, move out.

33:27.848 --> 33:28.948
Back up. Back up.
Out of the way.

33:37.724 --> 33:37.757
.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.291
Back up!

33:39.327 --> 33:41.260
It's so- back it up!D trust
get out the way!

33:41.295 --> 33:44.263
<i></i>

33:47.368 --> 33:48.968
No, no, no,
don't touch it.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.608
Hang on. We're gonna
take good care of you.

33:57.311 --> 33:59.378
We have full and clear
bilateral breath sounds.

33:59.414 --> 34:01.947
No tracheal deviation.

34:03.251 --> 34:04.517
What is this?
Six flags?

34:04.552 --> 34:07.453
Get them out of here.

34:07.488 --> 34:10.289
You heard the chief, cruz.

34:10.324 --> 34:12.058
All right, everybody.
Come on, back to the street.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.226
Let us do our work.
Let's go!

34:14.262 --> 34:16.162
Looks like the ladder went
straight through.

34:16.197 --> 34:18.364
i know. I know. I know.

34:18.399 --> 34:19.165
Hang in there.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.200
We should get him
on the monitor.

34:21.235 --> 34:23.469
Hey, capp, you're gonna want
to cut right here.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.142
Running a line.

34:33.448 --> 34:35.481
We need more pressure.

34:37.185 --> 34:38.417
The ladder may have
nicked an artery.

34:38.453 --> 34:39.418
His bp's dropping fast.

34:39.454 --> 34:41.487
All right, cruz, tony,
stabilize the ladder.

34:41.522 --> 34:43.556
Capp, when you're ready,
go for it.

34:47.729 --> 34:51.430
Whizzer saw would be faster.

34:51.466 --> 34:53.933
This is fine, thanks.
Capp, when you're ready.

34:53.968 --> 34:56.502
I'm telling you
get the whizzer.

35:03.311 --> 35:04.677
Lieutenant?

35:06.714 --> 35:08.214
Give me that.

35:19.460 --> 35:22.128
Do your men not recognize
an order when they hear one?

35:22.163 --> 35:25.631
Chief, are you taking over
as incident commander?

35:25.666 --> 35:27.633
I'm observing.

35:27.668 --> 35:29.769
Then back off
and let my men do their job.

35:29.804 --> 35:31.704
Excuse me?

35:31.739 --> 35:34.640
Look, you want
to take me on? Good.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.442
I will take this as far
as you want to go,

35:36.477 --> 35:39.378
But right now,
back off my scene.

35:53.327 --> 35:55.094
All right.

36:16.651 --> 36:18.450
He got in his buggy
and drove off.

36:18.486 --> 36:19.618
Not another word.

36:19.654 --> 36:22.488
Good for you, chief.
Is it?

36:22.523 --> 36:24.456
He had no cause
to come at you.

36:24.492 --> 36:26.826
Just took a while to drum that
through his thick skull.

36:26.861 --> 36:28.694
Yeah,
but i answer to anderson,

36:28.729 --> 36:31.764
And he and i need to find a way
to work together,

36:31.799 --> 36:33.599
For the good of the department.

36:37.205 --> 36:38.671
I'll catch up with you.

36:42.577 --> 36:44.276
Hey, you seen stella?

36:44.312 --> 36:46.545
She and dawson were
taking brett out tonight.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.714
A "forget your troubles" thing.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.282
Ah.

36:51.352 --> 36:54.320
<i></i>

37:00.494 --> 37:01.460
I wanted her to blow off
some steam.

37:01.495 --> 37:03.562
I just didn't know
she'd have so much of it.

37:04.832 --> 37:06.799
Oh, come on.
She's fine.

37:08.336 --> 37:09.668
Cheers.

37:09.704 --> 37:12.738
Hey, guys!

37:12.773 --> 37:15.307
Guess what!
Hi!

37:15.343 --> 37:17.376
What?
I'm getting married!

37:19.780 --> 37:23.148
You see--see jacques?
The one with the face?

37:23.184 --> 37:24.750
He's from canada.

37:24.785 --> 37:28.420
And he needs his green card
so he can stay here.

37:28.456 --> 37:30.322
And so--
we're out of here.

37:30.358 --> 37:32.858
We could go to city hall.
No, no, we'll go.

37:32.894 --> 37:35.160
See the justice of the peace.

37:35.196 --> 37:36.862
Even if it's uncomfortable
after, like,

37:36.898 --> 37:38.430
Just because they're, like,
you know--

37:38.466 --> 37:40.432
Yeah.
They'll expect one thing.

37:40.468 --> 37:42.868
It means you should take stock.
Definitely.

37:42.904 --> 37:45.738
Hi.
I'm looking for the owner.

37:45.773 --> 37:47.206
Found him.

37:47.241 --> 37:49.775
No, a different guy?

37:49.810 --> 37:52.244
Oh.

37:57.485 --> 37:59.351
Told you i was gonna
pay you back.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.790
Ah.
It's greg, by the way.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.892
Ah, greg. Christopher.

38:06.928 --> 38:09.728
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.534
I got the job.

38:15.569 --> 38:18.537
That's great!
Yeah, i'm so excited.

38:30.184 --> 38:33.352
All right, well, uh, thanks.

38:34.922 --> 38:38.924
You have no idea how much
your gesture meant to me.

38:44.332 --> 38:45.831
Listen. Not so fast.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.667
Uh, you're drinking free
tonight.

38:48.703 --> 38:50.169
Come on, what do you want?

38:50.204 --> 38:52.338
Yeah!

38:52.373 --> 38:53.839
Greg got a job!

38:53.874 --> 38:55.341
All right, greg!

38:55.376 --> 38:57.276
All right,
what are you drinking?

39:00.715 --> 39:03.415
Wow. Someone's
riding high this morning.

39:03.451 --> 39:06.652
Eh, just the goodness
of my fellow man makes me smile.

39:09.957 --> 39:11.623
Boden?

39:14.862 --> 39:16.962
I want to thank you
for helping me realize

39:16.998 --> 39:18.998
I've been going about things
all wrong.

39:19.033 --> 39:21.367
You'll have to forgive me.
I'm new to the job.

39:21.402 --> 39:24.603
I understand now
i can't just snap my fingers

39:24.638 --> 39:28.440
And get rid of you,
but there are actions

39:28.476 --> 39:31.577
I can take that i don't have
to justify to anybody.

39:37.518 --> 39:41.320
Firehouse 51, after a careful
review of second shift,

39:41.355 --> 39:44.490
The department has found room
for some improvements.

39:44.525 --> 39:47.626
Officers will remain in place
for the time being,

39:47.661 --> 39:51.463
But as for the rest of you,

39:51.499 --> 39:56.402
Next shift, stella kidd,
you will report to firehouse 27.

39:56.437 --> 39:59.571
Joe cruz, you'll report
to the 911 call center.

39:59.607 --> 40:01.340
Christopher herrmann
and randall mcholland,

40:01.375 --> 40:02.875
You will report to firehouse 90.

40:02.910 --> 40:05.411
Brian zvonacek, morningside.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.747
Sylvie brett,
you will now be at firehouse 27.

40:08.783 --> 40:11.483
Make sure to report promptly
for all shifts.

40:11.519 --> 40:14.820
I expect everyone to be on time
and with a smile on your faces.

40:14.855 --> 40:16.355
You have a problem with this,

40:16.390 --> 40:17.990
Take it up
with the fire commissioner.

40:24.565 --> 40:26.432
Defend the past, save
the future
