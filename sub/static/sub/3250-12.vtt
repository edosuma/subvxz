Last night, my telly went off
in the middle of Top Model.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.439
John Joe's waiting.
I'll do the changing rooms, too.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.199
Oh, thanks, Shona.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.079
There's a list on the fridge.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.239
I saw it.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.959
And I've labelled the food
and sort of numbered it.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.599
Sophie, you don't need to number food.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.319
It's just a suggestion.
Also, my mum might phone.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.079
-Might?
-And your mum and my dad.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.239
And, you know, just innocent people.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.239
I can cope on my own.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.439
Now, please go and have a rest.
You need it.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.279
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.679
And thank you for this.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.159
And I do know you can cope on your own.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.879
And I may have drawn some arrows
in the fridge.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.519

01:34.200 --> 01:37.199
Mum, it's not just you.
I'm phoning everybody.

01:37.480 --> 01:41.119
I'm texting the world,
"Craig Owens can do it on his own."

I'm coping on my own!

01:55.120 --> 01:57.359
Hello, Craig. I'm back!

01:58.440 --> 01:59.519
She didn't...

01:59.600 --> 02:00.959
How could she phone you?

02:01.040 --> 02:03.519
How could who phone me?
Nobody phoned me. I'm just here.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.639
Oh, you've redecorated!
I don't like it.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.799
It's a different house. We moved.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.239
Yes, that's it.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.039
Doctor, what are you doing here?

02:12.120 --> 02:14.919
Social call. Thought it was about time
I tried one out.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.799
How are you?

02:17.760 --> 02:18.919
I'm fine.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.159
This is the bit where I say
I'm fine, too, isn't it?

02:21.240 --> 02:22.879
I'm fine, too.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.039
Yes, I meant on my own
with the baby, yes.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.159
Because no one thinks I can cope
on my own, which is so unfair.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.479
Because I can't cope on my own with him.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.239
I can't. He just cries all the time.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.359
I mean, do they have off switches?

04:12.440 --> 04:14.279

-Probably not.

though personally he prefers to be
called Stormageddon, Dark Lord of All.

-That's what he calls himself.

popping out again, just being social,

-Never mind what?
-Mmm, nothing.

Am I noticing? No.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.519
No, I am not.

around for electrical fluctuations.

and they'll only waste it

and you're investigating it.

about Nina's emotionaljourney,

10:23.120 --> 10:25.879
A teleport? Like a beam-me-up

10:26.320 --> 10:28.559
-teleport, like you see in Star Trek?
-Exactly.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.159
Someone's been using
a beam-me-up Star Trekteleport.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.039
Could be disguised as anything.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.319
But a teleport in a shop?
That's ridiculous.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.759
What was that?
Was that the lights, again?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.759
(HIGH-PITCHED) Yes, that's it.
That's all. It's the lights.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.919
Why'd you say that like that?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.959
Like what? (LOWERS PITCH) Like what?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.399
Like that, in that high-pitched voice.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.879
Just keep looking at me, Craig.
Right at me. Just keep looking.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.079
-Why?
-Well, because, because...

10:52.160 --> 10:53.279
Because I love you.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.079
You love me?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.999
Yes, Craig, it's you.
It's always been you.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.119
Me?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.999
Is that so surprising?

11:00.080 --> 11:01.479
Doctor, are you going to kiss me?

11:01.560 --> 11:02.679
Yes, Craig. Yes, I am.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.519
Would you like that?
Bit out of practice,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.199
but I've had some wonderful feedback.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.119
Doctor, no. I can't. I'm taken!

11:09.200 --> 11:10.439
(SCREAMING) Oh, my God!

11:10.520 --> 11:12.519
Or we could just hold hands if
it'd make you feel more comfortable.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.639
What is happening?

11:13.720 --> 11:16.839
Well, first of all, I don't really
love you, except as a friend.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.399
What is that?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.159
(YELLING)

11:25.560 --> 11:28.199
-Quick reverse.
-Okay, what the helljust happened?

11:28.560 --> 11:29.599
(LIFT BELL DINGS)

11:30.360 --> 11:33.119
They must have linked the teleport
relay to the lift, but I've fused it.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.599
They can't use that again.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.239
-Stuck up there on their spaceship.
-What were those things?

11:40.040 --> 11:41.159
Cybermen.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.399
A ship?

11:43.480 --> 11:44.639
A spaceship?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.679
We were in space!

11:49.400 --> 11:53.119
It's got to be up there somewhere.
Can't get a fix. It must be shielded.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.359
But you fused the teleport.
You sorted it.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.479
They can't come back.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.199
No, no, no.
I just bought myself a little time.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.759
I've still got to work out what
they're doing before I can stop it.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.519
But if they've got the teleport,

12:02.600 --> 12:03.839
and they're that evil,

12:03.920 --> 12:05.319
why haven't they invaded already?

12:06.920 --> 12:08.919
Craig, take Alfie and go.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.479
No.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.839
-No?
-No.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.239
I remember from last time.
People got killed.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.199
People that didn't know you.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.599
I know where's safest for me and Alfie,

12:22.680 --> 12:24.039
-and that's right next to you.
-Is that so?

12:24.120 --> 12:26.479
Yeah, you always win.
You always survive.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.439
Those were the days.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.559
I can help you.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.519
I'm staying.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.399
Craig...

12:41.960 --> 12:43.319
All right!

12:43.400 --> 12:45.799
All right, maybe those days
aren't quite over yet.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.239
Let's go investigate.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.079
I mean, there's no immediate danger now.

Where am I investigating?

13:04.360 --> 13:05.439
Well, look around.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.159
Ask questions.
People like it when you're with a baby.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.239
Babies are sweet. People talk to you.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.439
That's why I usually take
a human with me.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.839
-So I'm your baby?
-You're my baby.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.479
Mmm.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.599
Okay.

13:23.200 --> 13:28.079
I hope you don't mind my saying, Doctor,
but I think you look ever so sweet.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.319
You and your partner and the baby.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.959
Partner? Yes, I like it.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.399
Is it better than companion?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.519
"Companion." Sounds old-fashioned.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.759
There's no need to be coy these days.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.799
Not noticed anything unusual
around here lately, Val?

13:42.880 --> 13:44.599
-Well...
-Yes, yes?

13:44.800 --> 13:47.319
Mary Wornock saw...

13:47.400 --> 13:50.919
Don Petheridge snogging Andrea Groom

13:51.000 --> 13:54.959
outside the Conservative Club
on his so-called day off golfing.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.159
Yeah?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.279
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea
after all.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.279
And then there's that silver rat thing.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.039
What?

14:14.640 --> 14:15.759
(ALFIE COOING)

14:16.120 --> 14:19.679
All right, Alfie,
you watch Daddy investigate.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.919
-I'm Craig.
-Yeah?

14:43.200 --> 14:45.119
Do you mind if I ask you some questions?

14:45.200 --> 14:46.359
You what?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.919
Just between me and you, in confidence.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.199
Have you noticed anything

14:51.960 --> 14:53.199
unusual?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.279
-Interesting?
-You what?

14:57.440 --> 14:58.999
Talk to me about ladieswear.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.279
George!

15:04.080 --> 15:05.519
Hi, George.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.919
Nice uniform.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.159
Silver rat...

15:14.240 --> 15:15.399
Glowing red eyes.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.639
Yes.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.479
Then it zizzed off.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.759
I wanted to get one for my nephew,

15:20.840 --> 15:23.079
but stockroom say there's no such item.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.559
Oh, I bet they do.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.919
Well, what was it, then? Answer me that.

No. Okay, long shot.

I see you've met my friend Craig.

-Nice uniform, George.
-Hmm.

that's all right, then.

Sorry.

I need today.

for the same money, if you don't mind...

-Please teach me how to do that.
-No. Hold on, un-shh.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.119
It's a power, isn't it?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.359
Some sort of weird alien hypnotic power.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.719
I bet you excrete some sort of gas
that makes people love you.

A Cyberman took Shona.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.399
A Cyberman?
I thought it was a little silver rat.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.079
It's not a rat.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.759
It's a Cybermat.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.999
All right. Don't have a go at me
just because I don't know the names.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.199
Cybermats are infiltrators.
Very small, very deadly.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.879
They collect power
like bees collect pollen.

the electrical energy from this area.

a nuclear power station?

-Okay, why?
-Let's ask it.

We wait for the shop to shut,
we stake the place out,

17:41.800 --> 17:43.279
we grab ourselves a Cybermat.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.119
And this is just a coincidence, is it?

-Aliens in Colchester.
