02:15.552 --> 02:17.971
MIXED BATHING SPRINGS
CAPYBARAS & HUMANS

02:44.289 --> 02:46.833
I thought you would come here.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.171
Why did you betray the humans?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.133
You drove them mad by making them scared.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.636
Humans are weak.
Their extinction is inevitable.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.140
Don't be ridiculous! You're human, too!

03:03.808 --> 03:05.643
I'm not, Akira.

03:14.652 --> 03:15.945
I'm Satan.

03:18.948 --> 03:22.201
I challenged the icy cold God
some time ago.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.166
I was cast from Heaven,

03:28.458 --> 03:30.251
wandered the dark universe,

03:30.752 --> 03:32.170
and came to Earth.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.382
Long before humans existed,

03:37.133 --> 03:39.093
this world was dominated by...

03:39.969 --> 03:40.803
demons.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.268
Weakness meant death.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.729
Only the strong survived.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.065
It is the history of power.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.027
In order to survive this world of battle,

03:56.110 --> 03:58.029
demons gained a special ability.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.952
They gained the characteristics of
other organisms by merging with them.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.455
Just as humans developed weapons,

04:08.039 --> 04:12.877
demons changed their own bodies
into powerful weapons by this merging.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.341
I liked the demons' simple
and straightforward hearts,

04:18.925 --> 04:20.510
and settled down here.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.637
But unmerciful God

04:23.179 --> 04:27.392
did not allow us to exist,
even on this outpost of a planet.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.770
But we were not dead.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.523
We remained as pure will.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.484
Eventually, when humans appeared on Earth,

04:36.567 --> 04:40.154
we substantialized ourselves
by merging with humans,

04:40.238 --> 04:42.198
and began to regain existence.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.620
The legends of werewolves,
vampires, and ogres

04:48.246 --> 04:51.165
are all forms of demons
merged with humans.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.211
Further back in antiquity
were people who learned of us

04:55.295 --> 04:57.463
from our many strange remains.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.163
I came back into existence,

05:30.705 --> 05:34.083
but the memory of being Satan
was locked away in my mind.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.210
However...

05:51.434 --> 05:54.729
I instinctively eliminated those
who tried to kill me.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.467
Are you okay?

06:40.817 --> 06:41.651
It's okay.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.155
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Don't be afraid.

06:47.281 --> 06:48.241
Don't be afraid.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.002
Even after Jenny took me away,

07:00.461 --> 07:04.298
I didn't recover any memory of
being Satan, but subconsciously,

07:04.841 --> 07:07.844
I was putting a plan
to revive demons into action.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.515
But God was very unmerciful.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.684
I guess God hates me.

07:15.560 --> 07:20.106
God found out that the demons were revived
and he began to attack again.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.608
He didn't kill humans,

07:23.151 --> 07:24.902
but aimed to destroy only us.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.198
Akira, humans will perish.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.118
You must live with us.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.871
You want me to be a demon?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.582
You are a demon, not a human.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.125
I'm a human!

07:40.293 --> 07:42.336
You made my body into a demon.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.047
It is the strongest vessel.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.510
My family, my friends,
and the person that I loved.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.471
I lost everyone.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.764
All because of demons.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.768
Akira.
Let's live in the new world together.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.814
I made you merge with the champion,
Amon, for that reason.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.318
Come, Akira!

08:06.611 --> 08:08.571
You're full of shit!

08:12.116 --> 08:14.619
You robbed me of my most important thing.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.122
I would like to cry for you...

08:19.749 --> 08:21.751
but my tears have all dried up.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.587
I do not intend to fight you.

08:25.129 --> 08:28.674
I'm dying to beat the hell out of you.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.722
Humans won't lose to demons like you.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.768
I swear I'm going to destroy you all.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.020
If you make me your enemy,

08:41.646 --> 08:42.480
you'll die.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.025
Even if that's the case,

08:46.359 --> 08:50.071
I will definitely drag you down
to hell with me.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.948
You will regret this.

08:52.740 --> 08:56.369
The next time I see you,
I'm going to kill you..

09:03.209 --> 09:04.377
Is all well?

09:05.002 --> 09:05.836
It is.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.465
Who was it that destroyed my apartment?

09:10.174 --> 09:11.801
It was Xenon's men.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.554
They have already been annihilated.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.890
My apologies for not
detecting their frustrations.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.100
No.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.644
The fault is mine.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.606
CRYBABY

09:49.130 --> 09:50.590
This will protect you.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.924
Will it work?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.634
Of course it will.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.318
Akira, everyone is here.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.904
They're all Devilmen
who gathered because of Miki's appeal.

10:16.198 --> 10:21.162
I don't intend to quietly watch humans
being destroyed by demons.

10:22.246 --> 10:25.082
I'll destroy the demons
with my own hands.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.877
We will fight, too.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.839
All Devilmen around the world
will join this battle.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.175
Foolish demons!

10:34.675 --> 10:37.595
The Devilmen won't let you have your way.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.273
It has begun.

11:31.899 --> 11:36.112
The foolish and weak humans
are annihilating themselves.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.863
Just as I had expected.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.116
Satan, you have lived with humans,

11:40.199 --> 11:42.743
and are familiar
with their weaknesses.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.286
Bravo.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.873
Since you were wounded in battle,

11:47.957 --> 11:50.709
I feared you would not return.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.921
I have not given up.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.382
After we destroy the humans,

11:56.715 --> 11:59.552
we will battle God again
for our existence.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.178
We must hurry.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.974
Eat all the humans before God gets here.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.062
Knock it down.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.038
A nuclear bomb.

12:29.165 --> 12:29.999
It's Hydra.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.294
He's here.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.670
He's awakened.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.672
It's our victory!

12:37.673 --> 12:41.760
Satan is an angel
who challenged God to fight in the past.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.098
It is said he came to Earth
because he lost.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.811
He is noble, beautiful, and benign,
and said to have 12 feathers.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.398
What is that?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.383
Another demon?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.935
Rampant humans...

13:31.352 --> 13:34.605
We should be the only ones
who exist on this Earth.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.680
I found you. The last human beings.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.982
You still resist?

14:23.487 --> 14:24.321
Devilman.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.076
Ryo!

14:29.159 --> 14:30.077
You fool!

14:30.160 --> 14:32.496
The weak die
and the strong survive.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.081
That's the way of the world.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.084
Then you're on the wrong side!

14:40.754 --> 14:42.214
Satan, leave this to me.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.675
You should join the main war.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.095
It would be better
if you ignore Akira Fudo.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.055
Go.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.182
Yes, sir.

14:56.562 --> 15:00.065
Akira. Are you sure you want to fight me?

15:07.948 --> 15:09.283
Ryo!

15:30.220 --> 15:31.430
Is it their gang?

15:31.513 --> 15:32.473
I'm...

15:33.349 --> 15:34.308
Devilman!

15:38.771 --> 15:39.688
Forgive me!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.190
Help me!

15:53.452 --> 15:54.954
I won't let you.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.057
Please, use me.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.262
Use us.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.645
You can see the stars clearly.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.606
It's because all the humans are gone.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.195
The rabbit is probably dead.

18:34.822 --> 18:35.948
Look, Ryo.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.282
A rabbit.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.951
There's no rabbit.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.747
Those are shadows on the moon's surface,
due to elevation.

18:44.748 --> 18:46.834
The moon has no atmosphere.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.044
Then we've got to save them.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.171
Akira.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.007
There's no rabbit in that sky.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.178
I saw it with my own eyes.

19:04.017 --> 19:04.977
It's okay.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.168
Why does it form circles?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.670
It's the pinhole theory.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.172
Theory?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.549
Since the spaces are small like pinholes,

19:35.632 --> 19:37.217
they act like points of symmetry,

19:37.301 --> 19:39.428
and reflect the sun upside-down
on the ground.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.889
Point of...

20:06.288 --> 20:07.789
It's over. It's going to die.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.501
-No! Stop!
-It's going to die soon. Give it to me.

20:12.044 --> 20:12.878
No!

20:13.879 --> 20:15.005
I'll kill it.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.215
No! Stop!

20:16.757 --> 20:18.550
Damn it. Why?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.062
AKIRA

20:37.194 --> 20:39.988
Why are you crying?
You knew it was gonna die.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.657
You're wrong.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.617
The weak ones die.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.869
No! No! No!

20:46.370 --> 20:47.788
Ryo, you're crying, too.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.417
Why? I'm not sad. It's obvious.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.253
Ryo, you're crying, too.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.052
Back then,

21:02.886 --> 21:05.305
I didn't know what you meant.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.227
Love doesn't exist.
There's no such thing as love.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.896
Therefore, there's no sorrow.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.023
That's what I thought.

21:18.110 --> 21:18.944
Akira.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.446
Why am I the only one talking?

21:30.289 --> 21:31.123
Akira?

21:40.257 --> 21:41.091
Akira.

21:42.884 --> 21:43.719
Right now...

21:45.178 --> 21:46.513
I'm feeling something.

21:47.597 --> 21:48.432
What is this?

21:52.269 --> 21:54.563
Tell me. What is this, Akira?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.858
Feel what I'm feeling right now.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.319
Listen to me.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.029
Akira.

22:03.071 --> 22:03.905
Look at me.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.450
Respond to me.

22:08.243 --> 22:11.038
Don't forget that
you've been with me till now.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.665
Say something.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.460
No, Akira.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.588
Don't leave me alone.

22:20.881 --> 22:21.798
Don't leave me.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.176
Please, be somewhere.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.345
Say something!

22:28.430 --> 22:30.557
Akira!

25:00.749 --> 25:04.419
THE END
