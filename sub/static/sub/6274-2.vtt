WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:08.274
<i>Previously on Masters Of Sex...</i>

00:08.326 --> 00:09.642
I think this is a Trojan horse.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.110
I think you've released
this material

00:11.145 --> 00:14.997
to piggyback on the so-called
sexual revolution.

00:15.033 --> 00:17.950
Mr. Buckland,
we <i> are</i> the sexual revolution.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.786
Ready, Mrs. Masters?

00:20.822 --> 00:22.288
There's no way
that great Bill Masters

00:22.340 --> 00:24.390
is going to admit
he's shooting blanks.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.559
No,
you cannot do that at school.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.660
You know that, right?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.711
Yeah.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.496
I want you to talk to Tessa.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.048
She won't listen
to a word I say.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.632
The sergeant and I
have discussed this,

00:33.668 --> 00:35.301
and I want to do this now.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.635
Uh, you want to...?

00:36.688 --> 00:37.853
To enlist.

00:37.889 --> 00:39.472
You forgot to mention it to me?

00:39.507 --> 00:40.806
Gin,
I didn't think he meant it.

00:40.842 --> 00:42.641
If they had their mother
around them more,

00:42.677 --> 00:44.643
If we meet him halfway
on this, we can reason with him.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.145
We're gonna do
everything we can

00:46.197 --> 00:47.613
to make sure our boy is safe.

00:47.682 --> 00:50.082
I cannot have our son come home

00:50.118 --> 00:51.484
in a flag-draped coffin.

00:52.954 --> 00:54.987
You're not exactly yourself.

00:55.039 --> 00:56.622
I think my children
deserve better

00:56.657 --> 00:58.708
than a mother that
gets by on two Serax every day.

00:58.743 --> 01:01.577
Serax?
For, uh, depression?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.996
I've thought a lot
about my marriage.

01:04.032 --> 01:06.766
I don't need Bill
to be all things

01:06.801 --> 01:11.554
as long as my home
and my family stays intact.

01:11.589 --> 01:13.339
Your home is safe.

01:13.391 --> 01:15.925
We do understand
each other, Gin.

01:22.266 --> 01:23.783
You're pregnant.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.903
Is it true?
Am I right?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.273
- I need to hear you say it.
- Bill.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.941
- Please.
- I'm pregnant.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.610
- Jesus.
- I know.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.378
Jesus, Virginia.
What is it?

02:26.414 --> 02:27.746
It's very unfortunate.

02:27.782 --> 02:29.515
- You think so?
- Don't you?

02:29.550 --> 02:33.502
Of course I think so.
I mean, the timing, the book.

02:33.537 --> 02:35.287
We're right on the cusp,
Virginia.

02:35.339 --> 02:36.955
I realize that.

02:37.008 --> 02:38.457
It's also...

02:38.509 --> 02:39.508
What?

02:39.543 --> 02:42.227
...impossible, given...

02:42.263 --> 02:44.179
It's George's.

02:44.215 --> 02:45.964
George's?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.299
Yes.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.801
George Johnson?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.069
Yes, Bill.

02:50.104 --> 02:53.188
We had a moment up at the lake.

02:53.224 --> 02:54.239
A moment?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.058
We were both terribly upset

02:56.110 --> 02:57.910
about Henry enlisting,
and we just--

02:57.945 --> 02:58.977
You just...?

02:59.013 --> 03:01.030
Yes. We just.

03:01.065 --> 03:03.716
Once.
It happened once.

03:07.071 --> 03:09.538
You're having a baby
with your ex-husband.

03:09.573 --> 03:11.423
- No.
- You just said--

03:11.459 --> 03:13.158
I said that I was pregnant.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.760
I did not say
I was having a baby.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.795
I see.

03:16.831 --> 03:19.565
A-and yet...

03:19.600 --> 03:22.067
I was waiting...

03:22.103 --> 03:24.303
Un-- until this was done.

03:24.338 --> 03:28.340
I-I didn't want to be
incapacitated for this.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.226
And I-- I guess I was hoping

03:31.262 --> 03:33.846
that maybe the problem
would take care of itself.

03:33.848 --> 03:37.383
But it hasn't, so I will.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.854
The alternative is...

03:41.856 --> 03:43.355
it's ludicrous.

03:43.357 --> 03:47.459
I mean, given everything,
could you even imagine?

03:47.495 --> 03:49.194
No.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.696
And you're all right?

03:50.731 --> 03:53.532
N-nauseated, clearly.

03:53.584 --> 03:55.584
All right with...?

03:58.372 --> 04:00.339
Of course.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.791
Of course I am.
You don't have to worry.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.293
I've already made
an appointment.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.812
Where? Because there's
only one place, one doctor--

04:06.847 --> 04:08.046
Dr. Ennis.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.264
Yes.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.884
I'm seeing him
the day after tomorrow.

04:16.107 --> 04:18.474
And that'll be that.

04:47.471 --> 04:48.954
Should I be worried?

04:51.342 --> 04:53.142
You haven't even
taken off your coat.

04:53.177 --> 04:54.259
Did I wake you?

04:54.311 --> 04:55.627
No, no.
I was waiting up.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.762
I wanted to hear how it went.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.597
Oh, I told you on the phone.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.933
Well. It went well.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.652
Yes, but your voice
sounded funny.

05:03.687 --> 05:04.770
Strained.

05:04.855 --> 05:06.438
I-I thought maybe
you were waiting

05:06.490 --> 05:08.106
to deliver the bad news
in person.

05:08.159 --> 05:10.692
There's no--
there's no bad news.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.977
The press was very positive.

05:13.147 --> 05:14.346
So you're celebrating.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.415
I am.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.617
Hooray.

05:18.669 --> 05:21.587
Well,
that's... Wonderful, Bill.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.289
What a triumph.

05:24.341 --> 05:26.675
I know how anxious you've been.

05:26.710 --> 05:29.294
M-maybe now you can breathe
a little easier.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.129
I intend to.

05:31.182 --> 05:33.682
Enjoy the fruits of your labors,

05:33.717 --> 05:37.886
take a break from all those late
nights burning the midnight oil.

05:39.056 --> 05:40.889
Spend some time with the kids.

05:40.975 --> 05:42.307
Of course.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.395
Howie's over his cold.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.813
I meant to ask.

05:47.865 --> 05:49.064
Johnny made $3

05:49.116 --> 05:51.283
helping the couple next door
hang wallpaper.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.951
They're very nice, the Edleys.

05:52.987 --> 05:56.488
He's a-a big guy,
a former football player.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.091
Maybe he could help you
clean the rain gutters.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.393
I thought you were
calling a service.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.661
Yes, well...

06:02.663 --> 06:05.163
You should see how they've
cleaned up the place.

06:05.216 --> 06:09.218
Well...
You will.

06:09.253 --> 06:11.003
They've invited us to dinner.

06:11.055 --> 06:13.722
Lib, please. You know
I'm not one for socializing.

06:13.757 --> 06:15.307
But I am.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.176
And it would be really nice
to have some new friends.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.729
To have friends, period.

06:20.764 --> 06:22.347
We have friends.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.116
We have Virginia.

06:24.151 --> 06:29.605
She's... lovely,
but it's not enough.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.891
It's not enough for me.

06:35.663 --> 06:39.631
They asked Johnny
if I was a single mother.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.084
Can you imagine?

06:42.119 --> 06:43.285
Moved in a week ago,

06:43.337 --> 06:45.704
and they haven't seen you
coming or going,

06:45.756 --> 06:47.472
so we are going to remedy that,

06:47.508 --> 06:49.341
you and I.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.627
I'm making pigs in blankets.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.647
Take off your coat, Bill.
Welcome home.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.693
Keys, please.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.195
Wasn't that the deal?

07:10.231 --> 07:12.931
I don't go into your purse,
you don't go into mine.

07:12.984 --> 07:15.768
Y-you can't have
the car today, Tessa.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.237
No. Remember, Susan,
Nina, and I are going downtown

07:18.272 --> 07:20.489
after school today to line up
for Bob Dylan tickets.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.573
So I'll drop you at the office

07:21.609 --> 07:22.858
and pick you up
when you're done.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.410
I'm not going in this morning.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.195
Then why do you need the car?

07:26.247 --> 07:28.414
Because I have an appointment.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.720
With a-a travel agent.

07:36.357 --> 07:38.707
Bill and I have
a lot of trips planned

07:38.759 --> 07:41.093
in connection with the book, and
so I'm-- I'm interviewing

07:41.128 --> 07:43.295
a travel agent who will make
those accommodations for us

07:43.347 --> 07:44.963
- from now on.
- So I'll drive you.

07:45.016 --> 07:47.016
I don't know how long
it's going to take.

07:47.051 --> 07:49.301
So then I'll drop you and
you'll take a cab to the office.

07:49.353 --> 07:50.886
I may not go into the office.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.471
So then you'll take a cab home.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.856
Tessa...

07:53.891 --> 07:56.542
Why can't you just ask one
of your friends to drive you?

07:56.577 --> 07:59.028
No, I can't, because I said
you said I could have the car.

07:59.063 --> 07:59.978
You promised me, and--

08:00.014 --> 08:01.814
No, I did not promise.

08:01.816 --> 08:02.865
I said "We'll see."

08:02.900 --> 08:04.416
"We'll see" is not a no.

08:04.452 --> 08:05.617
Tessa, come on.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.903
If you meant "No,"
you should have said "No"

08:07.955 --> 08:09.488
because all that
"We'll see" does

08:09.490 --> 08:10.823
is make me think it's possible,

08:10.825 --> 08:12.374
and then I end up ruining
things,

08:12.410 --> 08:14.159
not just for myself,
but for my friends,

08:14.211 --> 08:16.378
when really you have
no intention of saying "Yes."

08:16.414 --> 08:19.415
Fine. Then next time, I'll
just say "No" from the beginning.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.467
So what,
now I can never have the car?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.385
Tessa,
what do you want from me?

08:23.421 --> 08:26.505
I just want you to be aware
of all the things you ruin for me

08:26.507 --> 08:27.840
because you don't remember,

08:27.842 --> 08:29.508
or because you promise
and then change or your mind,

08:29.560 --> 08:31.260
or because you think
what's going on with you

08:31.312 --> 08:33.095
is more important
than what's going on with me.

08:33.147 --> 08:36.231
You have no idea what
is going on with me, Tessa!

08:36.267 --> 08:39.400
I know you're planning
business trips that'll take you away

08:39.437 --> 08:42.020
that'll leave me to fend for
myself, which I'm fine to do

08:42.073 --> 08:44.740
as long as you don't make it
impossible for me to do things

08:44.775 --> 08:46.191
like go to a Bob Dylan concert,

08:46.243 --> 08:48.827
which is a small reward
for piratically raising myself!

08:55.836 --> 08:58.170
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

08:59.874 --> 09:02.374
I'm sorry, too, about the car.

09:02.426 --> 09:05.010
So you'll reschedule
with the travel-agent person?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.545
No, Tessa, I will not.

09:06.597 --> 09:07.963
God, mom!

09:08.015 --> 09:10.215
You're the worst mom ever,
you know that?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.351
And I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

09:20.978 --> 09:24.613
Whatever that call was, it
put you 20 minutes behind schedule.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.115
You had the Volgers at 9:30,

09:26.150 --> 09:28.734
which means I had to push
the McCormicks to 11:00.

09:28.786 --> 09:31.120
The McCormicks.
Uh, dyspareunia?

09:31.155 --> 09:32.788
No, that's the McClintocks.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.073
The McCormicks are
impotence after penile trauma.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.159
And little brown wants to get
the two of you on the horn

09:37.211 --> 09:38.677
this morning
to do a quick postmortem

09:38.712 --> 09:40.679
after the press conference,
but Virginia isn't in yet.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.297
I'll handle it.
Virginia's out today.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.549
In fact,
she may be out all week.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.967
Oh. Is she sick?

09:45.002 --> 09:47.419
Next month-- what
do we have the second Friday?

09:47.471 --> 09:49.087
Uh, that is the 12th,

09:49.140 --> 09:51.757
and the Levanders are coming in
from Phoenix for a follow-up.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.358
Move them to the following week.

09:53.394 --> 09:54.676
Well, if I recall,
Mr. Levander

09:54.728 --> 09:56.094
was already gonna be here
that week on--

09:56.147 --> 09:58.864
Reschedule it, Betty.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.983
Block off that entire morning.

10:01.018 --> 10:04.653
No patients, no pharma salesmen,
no window washers.

10:04.688 --> 10:05.771
What's going on?

10:05.823 --> 10:07.606
Remind Lester
to wear a tie that day.

10:07.658 --> 10:09.024
And you might
want to dig something

10:09.076 --> 10:11.109
out of the back of your closet
that goes below the knee.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.056
Mrs. Johnson?

10:41.108 --> 10:43.559
Mrs. Johnson?

10:43.611 --> 10:46.061
Oh, yes. Sorry.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.581
The doctor's ready for you.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.787
First, I'm going to
insert the speculum.

10:58.459 --> 10:59.908
Nurse.

11:01.545 --> 11:05.330
And then you're gonna feel
a slight pinch.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.001
That's the anesthetic.

11:09.053 --> 11:11.753
It's gonna numb you right up.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.974
Give it a second
to start working.

11:16.010 --> 11:18.393
Deep breaths.

11:18.429 --> 11:20.562
Okay, tell me.

11:20.598 --> 11:23.015
Can you feel this?

11:25.402 --> 11:26.568
This?

11:28.322 --> 11:29.938
And this?

11:32.026 --> 11:34.526
I don't feel anything.

11:42.670 --> 11:44.586
The elevators are
to remain out of operation

11:44.622 --> 11:46.004
for the rest of the afternoon.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.123
The door on the stairwell will
be locked from both sides.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.208
Now, this is the only point
of entry, correct?

11:50.261 --> 11:52.210
As far as I'm aware.

11:52.263 --> 11:54.079
Yes. Yes, it is.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.266
And all staff members
are accounted for?

11:57.301 --> 11:58.767
Everybody's here.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.053
We'll need to ask that
no one enter or exit the office

12:01.055 --> 12:02.437
for the length
of the appointment.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.389
And the blinds should be drawn
in every room.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.642
I'll make sure
that's taken care of right away.

12:06.694 --> 12:07.659
Thank you.

12:07.695 --> 12:09.728
And what's in here?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.229
That's the lab.

12:13.651 --> 12:14.700
What is that?

12:14.735 --> 12:18.704
It's, uh... That's a dildo.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.541
What are we supposed to
do when they get here--

12:22.576 --> 12:23.575
bow or curtsy?

12:23.627 --> 12:25.177
Oh, I have-- I have no idea.

12:30.467 --> 12:31.717
Dr. Masters.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.884
A pleasure.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.636
The pleasure is ours, sir.

12:34.672 --> 12:36.054
Please.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.808
May I introduce my associate.

12:39.843 --> 12:42.628
So nice to meet you,
Your Majesty.

12:43.814 --> 12:45.097
Your Highness?

12:46.567 --> 12:48.266
I'm so-- I'm so sorry.

12:48.319 --> 12:49.818
I have no idea what to call you.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.437
Your grateful servant.

12:52.473 --> 12:55.107
Of course,
there was no reason to think

12:55.109 --> 12:57.159
that it wouldn't happen
right away.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.612
My husband and I
are both very healthy,

13:00.614 --> 13:03.582
and my cycles are quite regular.

13:03.617 --> 13:08.120
But after three years
of trying, we became concerned.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.789
St. Louis
is a long way to travel.

13:10.841 --> 13:14.459
Surely there are other fertility
specialists closer to home.

13:14.511 --> 13:16.294
Mm, we've seen them all.

13:16.330 --> 13:19.931
They tell us
the problem is mine--

13:19.967 --> 13:21.266
a low sperm count.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.186
Did they suggest a treatment?

13:24.221 --> 13:27.189
It has been difficult
to find a doctor

13:27.224 --> 13:29.474
who would share anything more
than his advice.

13:29.510 --> 13:33.311
None of them wanted to risk
damaging his reputation

13:33.313 --> 13:35.397
should the treatment
not be successful.

13:35.449 --> 13:37.082
The stakes are very high.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.717
Not just for ourselves.

13:38.752 --> 13:40.986
The laws of succession
in my country

13:41.038 --> 13:43.705
require our union
to produce an heir.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.457
The next Shah of Iran.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.161
It is a tall order, Doctor.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.930
Well, I'll do everything
in my power to facilitate it.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.999
And I can tell you
that Dr. Masters

13:54.051 --> 13:56.468
has had tremendous success
with his capping procedure.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.170
Which is where we'll start.

13:58.222 --> 14:00.722
Capping tends to be quite
effective in cases like yours.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.742
I will have
the exam room readied.

14:04.812 --> 14:06.144
May I ask--

14:06.180 --> 14:08.747
Was this kind of intervention
necessary in your case?

14:08.816 --> 14:10.677
My case?

14:10.678 --> 14:13.961
Oh, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have assumed--

14:13.996 --> 14:17.249
No, I-- I didn't
think that I was showing.

14:17.284 --> 14:20.318
Only in the way a woman
hoping for a child can see.

14:20.353 --> 14:22.369
You put your hand
on your stomach

14:22.447 --> 14:24.317
when Dr. Masters was speaking?

14:24.426 --> 14:26.126
The baby was kicking his?

14:26.261 --> 14:30.882
I don't know.
I was paying attention--

14:30.918 --> 14:32.680
Oh, but you must.
May I?

14:32.776 --> 14:33.985
I don't mean to be forward,

14:33.020 --> 14:37.153
but maybe your good fortune
will rub off on me.

14:37.575 --> 14:39.047
Let's hope.

14:52.803 --> 14:55.387
Bill?
She's one patient.

14:55.439 --> 14:57.105
And her antenna was up.

14:57.141 --> 15:00.892
A few days ago, I heard Betty
ask if you were eating for two.

15:00.944 --> 15:02.394
That's an express--

15:02.446 --> 15:04.279
I asked her if I could finish
her coleslaw.

15:04.314 --> 15:05.280
She was joking.

15:05.315 --> 15:06.731
Lester told me

15:06.783 --> 15:10.068
he had to send back a woman's
lab coat in size medium.

15:10.070 --> 15:13.238
He assumed the company
sent it in error.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.698
Since when
does he open the mail?

15:15.699 --> 15:17.654
Virginia, it's time
for you to go.

15:17.658 --> 15:19.991
I really think that I
can manage a little while longer.

15:19.992 --> 15:21.993
We can squeeze in a few
interviews before the book.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.962
All it takes is for
one journalist to notice.

15:23.963 --> 15:25.797
I'll wear clothing
that's more forgiving,

15:25.798 --> 15:27.399
or I'll sit behind a
table the entire time.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.633
We can't take that risk.

15:28.634 --> 15:30.001
- You know that.
- Yes, but--

15:30.002 --> 15:32.003
If something's gonna
raise people's hackles,

15:32.004 --> 15:33.538
it's got to be the content of the work,

15:33.539 --> 15:35.507
not the morality of its researchers.

15:35.508 --> 15:36.908
A pregnant, unwed woman

15:36.909 --> 15:38.944
cannot be the standard-bearer
for the cause of--

15:38.945 --> 15:40.679
Cause of sexual enlightenment.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.648
Yes, Bill. I realize that. You
have made that very clear.

15:43.649 --> 15:46.585
I'm not the one who got
us into this situation, Virginia.

15:46.586 --> 15:48.822
You did the second you got
up off Frank Ennis' table

15:48.823 --> 15:50.424
and walked out...

15:54.061 --> 15:57.397
The time's come.

15:58.632 --> 16:00.367
You need to take a leave of absence.

16:01.702 --> 16:03.836
Or...

16:03.837 --> 16:05.605
Uh...

16:05.606 --> 16:08.774
I know. I could just marry George.

16:08.775 --> 16:10.609
Really, Virginia?

16:10.610 --> 16:13.011
One mistake with him
wasn't enough for you?

16:13.012 --> 16:14.948
Now, I've spoken with Christine Wesh.

16:14.949 --> 16:16.782
Sorry, who?

16:16.783 --> 16:18.416
She's a gynecologist,

16:18.417 --> 16:20.087
an excellent clinician, a real go-getter.

16:20.088 --> 16:24.023
And she's agreed to relocate
temporarily to St. Louis.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.591
Wait, you spoke
to her without me?

16:26.592 --> 16:29.630
Virginia, you proposed
Betty take over for you.

16:29.631 --> 16:30.830
Betty.

16:30.831 --> 16:32.697
It didn't seem to me like you were willing

16:32.698 --> 16:34.366
to contemplate a serious replacement,

16:34.367 --> 16:36.368
which is what we need, what I need.

16:36.369 --> 16:37.903
If I'm gonna maintain the practice,

16:37.904 --> 16:40.839
grow the clinic, represent the
book when it's published,

16:40.840 --> 16:42.674
I need a competent woman at my side

16:42.675 --> 16:45.377
to counteract the perception
that I'm a pervert.

16:45.378 --> 16:47.012
Look, the understanding
that I have with her

16:47.013 --> 16:49.648
is that the second you're ready
to come back after the birth--

16:49.649 --> 16:51.683
And you didn't think
that this was a decision

16:51.684 --> 16:52.951
that we should make together?

16:52.952 --> 16:54.686
I certainly wasn't consulted

16:54.687 --> 16:56.990
in all the decisions that
you made that affect me.

16:56.991 --> 17:00.726
This book is the culmination
of 12 years' work,

17:00.727 --> 17:03.028
and I'm not gonna let your
impulsivity put it in jeopardy.

17:03.029 --> 17:04.896
This was not an impulse.

17:04.896 --> 17:07.065
Really? You and
George planned this, huh?

17:07.066 --> 17:09.401
Conceiving the
baby was a mistake.

17:09.402 --> 17:11.538
Keeping it was a deliberate decision.

17:15.008 --> 17:17.642
I let my kids slip through
my fingers five years ago,

17:17.643 --> 17:20.377
the day that I agreed to
let them live with George.

17:20.378 --> 17:22.614
And there is nothing I
have ever done in my life

17:22.615 --> 17:24.115
that I regret more than that.

17:24.116 --> 17:27.487
I look back, I still don't even
understand how it happened.

17:27.488 --> 17:29.789
Do you, Bill?

17:29.790 --> 17:32.724
Can you tell me all the
things that had to go wrong

17:32.725 --> 17:34.594
in order for me to lose my kids?

17:38.065 --> 17:39.698
Well, I won't lose this one.

17:39.699 --> 17:42.970
You think I'm putting my
needs ahead of our needs?

17:42.971 --> 17:44.403
Well, I am for once.

17:44.404 --> 17:45.906
And if that makes you
question my commitment

17:45.907 --> 17:49.775
to everything that we have
worked so hard to build...

17:49.776 --> 17:51.644
then be that as it may.

17:51.645 --> 17:55.481
And I hope that she works
out for you, this Dr. Wesh.

17:55.482 --> 17:57.818
You knew this day
was coming, Virginia.

17:57.819 --> 17:59.852
Yes.

17:59.853 --> 18:01.519
But I also learned from you

18:01.520 --> 18:04.155
that there is no need to
face unpleasantness today

18:04.156 --> 18:05.690
when it can be put off until tomorrow.

18:05.691 --> 18:07.759
Oh, you learned that from me?

18:07.760 --> 18:11.098
When do you intend to
mention my situation to Libby, Bill?

18:13.934 --> 18:16.701
I know! Completely
out of the blue.

18:16.702 --> 18:18.937
You'd think, working
side by side every day,

18:18.938 --> 18:21.108
she'd find an opportunity
to tell me sooner.

18:21.109 --> 18:22.475
But, uh...

18:23.910 --> 18:26.580
Any better?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.821
Looking back now, I missed all the signs--

18:34.822 --> 18:36.956
irritability, fatigue.

18:36.957 --> 18:40.659
She got sick twice at the office.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.128
Uh, but I-I chalked it
up to the egg salad,

18:43.129 --> 18:47.130
which I've always maintained
they don't properly refrigerate.

18:47.768 --> 18:49.602
And George!

18:49.603 --> 18:50.536
Christ.

18:50.537 --> 18:52.639
That-- that weekend at the lake.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.841
I had no idea. Did you?

18:56.410 --> 18:57.809
Their relationship seemed so--

18:57.810 --> 19:00.145
well, I mean, "perfunctory"
is not right word.

19:00.146 --> 19:02.447
But, uh, they certainly
didn't seem to have

19:02.448 --> 19:03.784
any love lost between them.

19:07.087 --> 19:08.722
How about now?

19:13.093 --> 19:14.861
Maybe he's not the father.

19:15.996 --> 19:17.664
Oh, I'm certain he is.

19:18.865 --> 19:20.400
How can you be certain?

19:20.401 --> 19:23.003
You weren't there, were you?

19:24.571 --> 19:27.839
I'm sure Virginia's been
with other men since then.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.542
She's not really one to
sit home alone, is she?

19:30.543 --> 19:33.046
Well, there's no polite
way to inquire, is there?

19:33.047 --> 19:36.449
When a woman tells you news like this,

19:36.450 --> 19:38.985
I mean, you just take her at her word.

19:38.986 --> 19:40.719
Yeah.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.624
I always assumed Virginia
was a woman of her word.

19:57.036 --> 19:58.703
So, what happens now?

19:58.704 --> 20:01.041
Now? Well, we call a repairman.

20:01.042 --> 20:04.510
With Virginia. When is she due?

20:04.511 --> 20:07.045
Right around the release
of the book, unfortunately.

20:07.046 --> 20:09.049
And how do you intend
to explain her condition?

20:09.050 --> 20:10.449
I don't.

20:10.450 --> 20:12.150
No, she's gonna take a leave of absence,

20:12.151 --> 20:13.418
staring immediately.

20:13.419 --> 20:15.887
And then she can return
once the baby's born.

20:15.888 --> 20:19.793
So until then, what,
she's-- she'll just be at home?

20:19.794 --> 20:21.127
Yes.

20:21.128 --> 20:22.696
Keeping a low profile.

20:22.697 --> 20:24.430
Essentially.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.967
And emerge in
five months with a baby.

20:26.968 --> 20:29.536
That's right, yeah.

20:32.506 --> 20:34.139
I'm going to try

20:34.140 --> 20:35.840
to stay out of sight as much as possible.

20:35.841 --> 20:38.776
Really? You're never gonna
leave the house for five months?

20:38.777 --> 20:40.879
Because all it takes is
for one person to see you

20:40.880 --> 20:42.046
and leap to the conclusion--

20:42.047 --> 20:43.581
That I'm a wayward woman?

20:43.582 --> 20:45.150
Well, I'm afraid that's just something

20:45.151 --> 20:46.618
I'm going to have to live with.

20:46.619 --> 20:49.420
Do you think you're gonna
be alone in that judgment?

20:49.421 --> 20:52.423
That no one else is implicated
in this folly of yours?

20:52.424 --> 20:53.992
It's George's baby, Libby.

20:53.993 --> 20:56.794
Well, yes, of course it is.
I am quite certain.

20:56.795 --> 20:59.831
I am also quite certain that I
will be alone in thinking that.

20:59.832 --> 21:01.933
Well, it'll have his name.
I'm still a Johnson.

21:01.934 --> 21:03.570
With no ring on
your finger, Virginia.

21:03.571 --> 21:05.538
Without a husband in sight.

21:05.539 --> 21:07.572
- Except for mine, that is.
- Libby?

21:07.573 --> 21:08.940
I want to know what the plan is.

21:08.941 --> 21:11.442
What is the plan, the plan to
prevent people from thinking--

21:11.443 --> 21:12.844
Totally erroneously.

21:12.845 --> 21:14.913
What difference
does that make, Virginia,

21:14.914 --> 21:16.616
when there is nothing to say otherwise!

21:20.520 --> 21:22.755
People are gonna give me looks.

21:22.756 --> 21:24.791
Their heads tipped to the side,

21:24.792 --> 21:28.627
sorry for me, sorry for my children.

21:28.628 --> 21:30.528
"Oh, you poor thing," they will say.

21:30.529 --> 21:31.729
Well, I will not have it.

21:31.730 --> 21:33.064
Then tell them to go to hell.

21:33.065 --> 21:34.768
They are not the ones
I would want to say that to.

21:36.703 --> 21:38.672
Look, Libby,

21:38.673 --> 21:42.575
this is not something that I did to you.

21:42.576 --> 21:45.045
This has nothing to do with you or Bill.

21:45.046 --> 21:46.579
And yes, you're right.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.714
The truth of the matter will not
prevent tongues from wagging,

21:49.715 --> 21:51.883
but at a time where Bill and I are poised

21:51.884 --> 21:54.419
to be the center of attention,
I'm going into hiding.

21:54.420 --> 21:57.455
That is the concession that
I am making to idle gossip.

21:57.456 --> 21:59.457
Don't make that
out to be a sacrifice.

21:59.458 --> 22:00.625
You made a choice.

22:00.626 --> 22:01.993
Yes, and it was mine to make!

22:01.994 --> 22:03.861
And you're choosing to
have it implicate you,

22:03.862 --> 22:04.996
which it does not at all.

22:04.997 --> 22:06.798
- You know the truth.
- And Bill?

22:06.799 --> 22:09.000
Bill knows it too.
How could he not?

22:09.001 --> 22:11.903
I will tell you how.
Bill is a magical thinker.

22:11.904 --> 22:14.005
Bill can will anything into existence.

22:14.006 --> 22:16.474
If Bill wants to believe
something, he will find a way.

22:16.475 --> 22:19.844
This is the last thing
that Bill wants responsibility for.

22:19.845 --> 22:21.412
As far as he's concerned,

22:21.413 --> 22:23.481
this is a nuisance, an inconvenience.

22:23.482 --> 22:26.384
And something that his
partner has done without him.

22:26.385 --> 22:28.653
You two have collaborated
on everything else.

22:28.654 --> 22:30.088
I suspect, on a subconscious level,

22:30.089 --> 22:32.624
that he'll want to consider
this a joint effort, too.

22:32.625 --> 22:34.726
And with that comes a sense of obligation,

22:34.727 --> 22:36.427
an obligation that might distract him

22:36.428 --> 22:37.762
from the ones he already has.

22:37.763 --> 22:39.966
What do you
want me to do, Libby?

22:39.967 --> 22:41.400
I don't know!

22:41.401 --> 22:42.769
Something!

22:50.043 --> 22:51.645
Tessa!

22:53.046 --> 22:55.047
I made eggs!

22:55.048 --> 22:56.081
No time.

22:56.082 --> 22:57.484
Well, you have to eat something.

22:57.485 --> 22:59.652
No, something substantial.

22:59.653 --> 23:00.918
Before you were home all day

23:00.919 --> 23:02.620
pretending you weren't actually working,

23:02.621 --> 23:04.055
you didn't seem to care what I was eating.

23:05.026 --> 23:07.059
That's Carrie. I got to go.

23:07.060 --> 23:08.660
Wait, isn't she the one

23:08.661 --> 23:10.561
who crashed her mother's station wagon?

23:10.562 --> 23:12.597
Well, her brother
went off to college,

23:12.598 --> 23:13.831
so she's using his car now.

23:13.832 --> 23:14.934
No, Tessa.

23:14.935 --> 23:18.404
Tessa, I don't want you
driving with that girl.

23:18.405 --> 23:19.937
You know what, mom?

23:19.938 --> 23:23.710
You're the last person who gets
to lecture me on anything.

23:32.819 --> 23:35.087
Never met a king before.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.559
I went to grade school with
a kid named Harvey King.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.428
He wasn't actually a king.

23:42.429 --> 23:44.597
Just his name, obviously.

23:49.436 --> 23:50.804
Do you have a scepter?

23:53.073 --> 23:55.407
Uh, not with me.

23:55.408 --> 23:56.943
Right.

24:01.114 --> 24:02.816
How about a crown?

24:04.617 --> 24:06.820
It's, uh, ceremonial.

24:08.688 --> 24:11.725
That still counts, huh?

24:24.704 --> 24:26.506
Is Mrs. Johnson coming?

24:26.507 --> 24:29.743
Dr. Wesh will
be assisting us today.

24:31.911 --> 24:35.514
This is my third
capping in three months.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.915
Oh, it's not unusual
for patients to require

24:37.916 --> 24:40.820
more than one capping before
the procedure is successful.

24:40.821 --> 24:44.089
And if it is not... successful?

24:44.090 --> 24:45.892
W-what then?

24:46.926 --> 24:51.130
Well, uh, first
we'd have to determine

24:51.131 --> 24:53.765
whether lowered sperm
count is the only factor

24:53.766 --> 24:55.900
that's preventing the pregnancy.

24:55.901 --> 24:57.704
That would require a laparotomy.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.972
Surgery.

24:59.973 --> 25:03.007
An incision into the abdomen
that allows us to see

25:03.008 --> 25:05.943
if there's any damage to
the ovaries or the uterus.

25:05.944 --> 25:07.847
What kind of damage?

25:07.848 --> 25:11.885
There could be
scarring, uh, polyps, fibroids.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.889
There could
also be endometriosis.

25:15.890 --> 25:19.024
A simple overgrowth in the uterine lining.

25:19.025 --> 25:20.825
It's actually quite common.

25:20.826 --> 25:23.027
Some studies put the
number of women affected

25:23.028 --> 25:24.162
at upwards of 10%.

25:24.163 --> 25:26.164
Well, if it was
a case of endometriosis,

25:26.165 --> 25:28.433
I'd expect to see menstrual irregularity.

25:28.434 --> 25:31.869
And I've seen some patients
that are completely asymptomatic.

25:31.870 --> 25:33.773
That depends on the
severity of the disease.

25:33.774 --> 25:35.675
Yes, exactly.

25:39.646 --> 25:42.749
Betty asked me to tell you
that Harry Vetters is here.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.652
Thank you.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.156
I wasn't sure

25:52.157 --> 25:55.161
if I overstepped myself
just now it the exam room.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.528
You gave me a look.

25:56.529 --> 26:00.466
I wasn't quite sure how to
interpret it, I'm afraid.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.435
Did I do something wrong?

26:04.070 --> 26:07.772
Uh, I'm-- I'm just not
used to having someone chime in

26:07.773 --> 26:09.407
when I'm speaking to a patient.

26:09.408 --> 26:11.711
I assumed, when
you asked me to join you,

26:11.712 --> 26:14.680
that you expected me to participate.

26:14.681 --> 26:16.648
After all, didn't Virginia--

26:16.649 --> 26:18.817
"Mrs. Johnson"...

26:18.818 --> 26:22.387
uh, is there to offer support to patients,

26:22.388 --> 26:26.388
not to dispense medical
information during exams.

26:26.426 --> 26:32.065
In my interview, you
described the, uh-- the give and take

26:32.100 --> 26:33.731
that you have with Mrs. Johnson,

26:33.732 --> 26:34.866
how sometimes she jumps in,

26:34.867 --> 26:37.468
articulates something that you can't, or--

26:37.469 --> 26:39.138
Yeah, well, that is a dynamic

26:39.139 --> 26:43.138
that, uh, we've been able
to cultivate over years.

26:43.443 --> 26:46.144
I don't expect the same thing to happen

26:46.145 --> 26:49.682
with someone with whom
I've worked for a month.

26:51.584 --> 26:53.885
I am relieved
to hear you say that,

26:53.886 --> 26:56.556
and I am fully prepared
to follow your lead.

26:56.557 --> 26:59.491
So, for starters, perhaps you can tell me

26:59.492 --> 27:01.626
what sort of latitude I
have with this reporter?

27:01.627 --> 27:05.129
The one from the Times who's
waiting in the conference room?

27:05.130 --> 27:06.797
None whatsoever.

27:06.798 --> 27:09.969
Why-- why would you need
to speak to him at all?

27:09.970 --> 27:12.705
I assumed--

27:14.440 --> 27:17.108
I've studied the book. I'm
well-versed in the research.

27:17.109 --> 27:23.647
Isn't that the point-- for me
to stand in for Mrs. Johnson,

27:23.682 --> 27:25.984
to offer you a female counterpoint?

27:25.985 --> 27:27.852
Dr. Wesh, I-I don't--

27:27.853 --> 27:30.123
I don't know what led you to believe

27:30.124 --> 27:32.724
that I am... not able to, uh, function

27:32.725 --> 27:34.158
without Mrs. Johnson by my side,

27:34.159 --> 27:37.096
that on my own, I am incapable
of articulating a point of view

27:37.097 --> 27:38.998
about my life's work.

27:44.604 --> 27:46.806
I'll-- I'll handle this alone.

27:59.152 --> 28:01.386
To the accusation that,

28:01.387 --> 28:05.022
by providing women with a
guidebook to their own pleasure,

28:05.023 --> 28:08.459
you're encouraging female
promiscuity, you say what?

28:08.460 --> 28:10.628
I say, what do
you mean by promiscuity?

28:10.629 --> 28:13.564
I mean the pursuit
of sexual fulfillment

28:13.565 --> 28:16.667
for its own sake, simply to
satisfy a physical urge.

28:16.668 --> 28:19.872
We satisfy physical
urges all the time, Mr. Vetters.

28:19.873 --> 28:24.109
Every day-- hunger, thirst, fatigue.

28:24.110 --> 28:27.847
We don't have pejorative
associations with those urges.

28:27.848 --> 28:30.048
Sexual satiation is an urge

28:30.049 --> 28:32.583
every bit as instinctive
as the urge to sleep.

28:32.584 --> 28:34.752
Well, sleep doesn't
have the potential

28:34.753 --> 28:36.587
to be the ruination of our moral code.

28:36.588 --> 28:38.689
So in other words, procreation

28:38.690 --> 28:41.060
is the only acceptable
goal of sexual activity?

28:43.396 --> 28:45.496
I believe that way
of thinking is outdated.

28:45.497 --> 28:47.531
So sex as a means of, uh,

28:47.532 --> 28:49.836
strengthening a human
connection is passé?

28:49.837 --> 28:52.504
Not at all. We encourage it.

28:52.505 --> 28:55.840
What we discourage is this
idea that sexual fulfillment

28:55.841 --> 28:58.778
can only occur in a
traditional, singular context.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.412
Uh, I'm sorry.

29:00.413 --> 29:02.413
Can you explain in layman's terms,

29:02.414 --> 29:04.649
something our readers will understand?

29:04.650 --> 29:06.786
- Layman's terms.
- Uh-huh.

29:06.787 --> 29:11.090
Um... Let's see.

29:14.594 --> 29:18.497
Well, uh, say, for example,

29:18.498 --> 29:25.516
there's a woman who
adequately serves three men--

29:25.551 --> 29:27.004
three different men-- sexually.

29:27.005 --> 29:29.040
- Uh...
- And enjoys them all.

29:29.041 --> 29:31.010
"Serves three men," you said?

29:31.011 --> 29:33.578
Yes, three men.

29:33.579 --> 29:35.748
A woman who gives as good as she gets.

29:35.749 --> 29:37.883
I believe that woman...

29:37.884 --> 29:44.325
Uh, uh, uh, I'm sorry.
Um, "Gives as good as she gets."

29:44.424 --> 29:47.959
Yes, I believe
that woman is more honest

29:47.960 --> 29:52.921
than the, uh, faithful
wife in her own bedroom

29:52.956 --> 29:55.068
who serves one man whilst
thinking of another.

29:55.069 --> 29:57.769
There's-- there's physical promiscuity,

29:57.770 --> 30:00.037
and there's mental
promiscuity, Mr. Vetters.

30:00.038 --> 30:02.973
And I believe that the
hypocrisy of the latter

30:02.974 --> 30:05.545
presents a far greater
danger to our society.

30:05.546 --> 30:06.745
Huh.

30:06.746 --> 30:09.849
That's, um... yeah.

30:11.784 --> 30:15.054
That-- that may not have
come out the way I intended.

30:16.622 --> 30:18.791
- What I meant to say--
- One second.

30:18.792 --> 30:21.127
I-I-I want to get this down.

30:32.605 --> 30:34.140
Tess?

30:36.442 --> 30:37.476
Bill!

30:37.477 --> 30:39.143
Oh, good. I was just going to call you.

30:39.144 --> 30:40.878
I was sitting here, going over everything.

30:40.879 --> 30:42.815
You know what occurred to me?
We need a glossary.

30:42.816 --> 30:44.616
Get your coat.

30:44.617 --> 30:47.051
I don't know what she
told you, pal, but I sure as hell

30:47.052 --> 30:48.953
didn't have to force
myself on her that night.

30:48.954 --> 30:50.154
He knows that, George.

30:50.155 --> 30:51.758
Then what the
fuck is he doing here?

30:51.759 --> 30:53.058
Sit down.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.093
Please.

30:55.094 --> 30:57.096
Please.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.465
Now...

31:01.466 --> 31:03.434
- Bill is here in case--
- Is case what?

31:03.435 --> 31:04.902
In case you didn't understand

31:04.903 --> 31:08.474
that this is not a traditional
marriage she's proposing.

31:08.475 --> 31:14.221
It's simply an arrangement to
give your child legitimacy.

31:14.256 --> 31:16.514
Yeah, but it's not
just about the child, is it?

31:16.515 --> 31:19.517
It's about legitimizing your
partnership, too, right?

31:19.518 --> 31:22.920
How are you gonna spin this so
that it's in my best interests

31:22.921 --> 31:24.488
to have a sham marriage?

31:24.489 --> 31:26.490
Well, Virginia is on the verge

31:26.491 --> 31:28.793
of establishing herself as a
groundbreaking researcher.

31:28.794 --> 31:30.761
And that is a legacy

31:30.762 --> 31:32.663
worth protecting for the
sake of your children.

31:32.664 --> 31:34.431
- Don't you think?
- So they can grow up

31:34.432 --> 31:35.935
to appreciate their mother's famous

31:35.936 --> 31:38.036
and their father's a chump?

31:38.037 --> 31:39.772
Look, I...

31:40.907 --> 31:45.044
There's another option here
staring us in the face.

31:47.446 --> 31:49.515
You and me get married for real.

31:55.421 --> 31:56.554
George, come on.

31:56.555 --> 31:58.622
I think Virginia
made herself clear.

31:58.623 --> 32:00.426
Buddy, I'm not talking to you.

32:01.961 --> 32:04.663
Why can't we make a go of it, Gin?

32:04.664 --> 32:07.699
I mean, we loved each other once.

32:07.700 --> 32:10.067
We can do it again.
We're smarter now.

32:10.068 --> 32:12.069
We know what potholes to avoid.

32:12.070 --> 32:14.538
It's all
potholes with us, George.

32:14.539 --> 32:17.808
There is not enough flat
road to build a life on.

32:17.809 --> 32:20.010
We have hurt each other too much.

32:20.011 --> 32:22.949
We made each other feel
pretty good up at the lake.

32:22.950 --> 32:25.550
No. That was comfort.

32:25.551 --> 32:27.585
- That was not love.
- So?

32:27.586 --> 32:29.856
- It's a place to start.
- No.

32:29.857 --> 32:31.623
No, I can't.

32:31.624 --> 32:32.923
Because of this guy?

32:32.924 --> 32:34.493
No, because of me.

32:37.597 --> 32:40.998
So, um, I'm good enough
to fuck, but not to marry.

32:40.999 --> 32:44.503
Jesus, I just sound like a--
like a mistress, don't I?

32:45.705 --> 32:48.373
Don't I, Gini?

32:48.374 --> 32:52.143
Well, uh, I can't help you with this.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.612
I'm sorry.
This your problem, not mine.

32:54.613 --> 32:57.147
Oh, you think there
are no consequences for you

32:57.148 --> 32:59.450
if this book fails?

32:59.451 --> 33:01.852
You can barely
pay your bar tab, George.

33:01.853 --> 33:04.054
And that's with Virginia
covering your rent.

33:04.055 --> 33:06.457
And if I'm
unemployed-- unemployable--

33:06.458 --> 33:08.993
then how are we ever gonna
put to Tessa to college,

33:08.994 --> 33:11.462
let alone keep a baby
in diapers and formula?

33:11.463 --> 33:12.763
Oh, and your doctor boyfriend here

33:12.764 --> 33:14.131
is gonna let your kids become paupers?

33:14.132 --> 33:15.566
His career is on the line, too.

33:15.567 --> 33:17.434
I don't give a rat's
ass about his career.

33:17.435 --> 33:20.070
I care about us, about
you and me and the kids.

33:20.071 --> 33:21.538
Well, if that were true,

33:21.539 --> 33:23.607
then you never would have
forced me to give up custody.

33:23.608 --> 33:26.010
Well, this is
a way of getting it--

33:26.011 --> 33:28.913
of getting it back, all of
us together under one roof.

33:28.914 --> 33:31.882
It's too late.
The damage has been done,

33:31.883 --> 33:34.652
and that is a very, very
deep "pothole," George.

33:34.653 --> 33:36.854
It's just your name
on a piece of paper, George.

33:36.855 --> 33:38.022
That's all she's asking.

33:38.023 --> 33:40.991
Sounds to me like you're
the one doing the asking.

33:40.992 --> 33:44.897
No. I'm the one who's gonna
write you a very large check.

33:58.544 --> 33:59.412
Scalpel.

34:05.384 --> 34:07.386
I'm making the incision.

34:08.955 --> 34:12.824
There was distal blockage
on both fallopian tubes.

34:12.824 --> 34:13.891
Yes.

34:13.893 --> 34:18.063
Even if we,
uh, undid the blockage

34:18.063 --> 34:21.534
and removed the adhesions, it
wouldn't make a difference.

34:21.534 --> 34:25.071
The tubes have already
been permanently damaged.

34:26.839 --> 34:29.041
There is nothing
more that can be done?

34:29.042 --> 34:31.577
I'm so sorry.

34:33.646 --> 34:35.145
Does my husband know?

34:35.146 --> 34:36.716
He's asked for you.

34:36.717 --> 34:37.748
Shall I, uh--

34:37.750 --> 34:38.750
No.

34:38.751 --> 34:41.585
Please... I need a minute.

34:41.587 --> 34:44.554
Of course. Take
as much time as you need.

34:44.556 --> 34:46.726
If I could, I would take forever.

34:49.628 --> 34:52.697
The second I leave here,
everything will change.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.699
He will take another wife.

34:54.699 --> 34:57.535
And he will say, as you heard him,

34:57.536 --> 35:00.973
that it is merely a transaction,
that it is a necessity.

35:02.375 --> 35:03.841
You don't believe that?

35:03.842 --> 35:05.943
I believe that he believes it.

35:05.944 --> 35:08.414
But that is different than it being true.

35:08.415 --> 35:12.150
My husband thinks that
he can conceive a child

35:12.151 --> 35:15.085
with another woman and
withhold a part of his heart

35:15.086 --> 35:16.689
because he's saving it for me.

35:17.957 --> 35:21.460
I love him because he thinks he can.

35:22.895 --> 35:25.598
And I love him knowing that he can't.

35:29.368 --> 35:33.368
Oh, we must seem so exotic to you,

35:33.406 --> 35:37.008
with our bloodlines and our harems.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.477
These are not your problems.

35:39.478 --> 35:40.646
My problems?

35:40.647 --> 35:42.680
American problems.

35:42.681 --> 35:44.982
You think people in this country

35:44.983 --> 35:47.686
don't marry for reasons other than love?

35:47.687 --> 35:50.855
There are marriages of convenience here.

35:50.856 --> 35:54.459
Sometimes they work. They can work.

35:54.460 --> 35:56.462
But among three people, Doctor?

36:02.568 --> 36:06.138
It is an untenable
number, isn't it, three?

36:08.441 --> 36:11.109
Solid in architecture.

36:11.110 --> 36:14.712
Imagine a pyramid or a ziggurat.

36:14.713 --> 36:18.149
But in love, it is a
triangle turned upside down,

36:18.150 --> 36:21.885
balancing on a single point for
only a fraction of a second

36:21.886 --> 36:23.722
before it falls on its side,

36:23.723 --> 36:28.393
and the side that it falls on is
the one weighted with the child.

36:28.394 --> 36:34.249
It is a bond that two people
share stronger than anything.

36:34.767 --> 36:38.536
Well, perhaps you
imagine it in such a way

36:38.537 --> 36:39.870
because it's something

36:39.871 --> 36:41.774
that you've tried so hard to make happen.

36:41.775 --> 36:44.776
I haven't found, uh, parenting

36:44.777 --> 36:48.113
to be the connection
that trumps all others.

36:48.114 --> 36:49.915
What is, then?

36:51.117 --> 36:52.517
Desire.

36:52.518 --> 36:53.918
Of course.

36:53.919 --> 36:55.053
You are a man.

36:55.054 --> 36:57.689
And, uh, respect.

36:57.690 --> 37:03.641
A sense that your partner
is truly your other half.

37:04.797 --> 37:06.565
You have that?

37:08.067 --> 37:09.601
Yes.

37:09.602 --> 37:12.036
But also children.

37:12.037 --> 37:13.838
Three of them.

37:13.839 --> 37:15.674
I asked Mrs. Johnson.

37:17.376 --> 37:21.113
So you see, it is you who
cannot imagine it any different

37:21.114 --> 37:22.947
because you have it all.

37:22.948 --> 37:26.751
And I do not have enough,
certainly not enough to stay.

37:26.752 --> 37:29.154
So, y-you're leaving him?

37:29.155 --> 37:32.424
I have to...

37:35.394 --> 37:37.963
because I will see him loving a child

37:37.964 --> 37:41.534
that another woman gave him.

37:43.035 --> 37:46.604
And I will know that it will never again

37:46.605 --> 37:48.373
be the same between us.

37:48.374 --> 37:52.374
If I never loved him, I could manage.

37:54.747 --> 37:57.383
But after knowing what it is to be loved

37:57.384 --> 38:03.651
so... completely by this man...

38:05.958 --> 38:09.794
I could never settle
for anything less...

38:09.795 --> 38:13.132
than everything.

38:19.805 --> 38:22.074
I don't know what to say.

38:22.075 --> 38:23.875
It's a lovely offer,

38:23.876 --> 38:27.644
but George and I are just going
to go down to the courthouse.

38:27.645 --> 38:30.781
Well, I'd keep it
very simple, very small.

38:30.782 --> 38:33.719
Just the two of you and--
and Tessa, of course.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.920
No, not "of course."

38:35.921 --> 38:38.556
Tessa is not having any of it.

38:38.557 --> 38:40.658
I can't say I blame her.

38:40.659 --> 38:42.693
Perhaps if I talked to her.

38:42.694 --> 38:44.828
Let her know how nice it would be

38:44.829 --> 38:47.130
for the two of you to have her there.

38:47.131 --> 38:50.536
Libby, we're not
getting "married" married.

38:50.537 --> 38:54.038
Tessa knows that. We're
just making things legal.

38:54.039 --> 38:56.008
And I appreciate that.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.643
Don't you want to make some
memories for the baby?

38:59.644 --> 39:01.645
Take some pictures of the
two of you saying your vows

39:01.646 --> 39:03.981
so he knows what his parents
looked like on their wedding day?

39:03.982 --> 39:06.917
I'll be eight months
pregnant in those pictures.

39:06.918 --> 39:09.488
I think that'll pretty much
tell him the whole story.

39:11.624 --> 39:15.493
Don't you think it's worth trying?

39:15.494 --> 39:19.031
You mean, making
more of an effort to pretend?

39:19.032 --> 39:22.533
No. Trying to
love each other again.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.601
You sound just like George.

39:24.602 --> 39:26.603
So George wants it to work.

39:26.604 --> 39:28.872
Then why?
Why-- why are you holding out?

39:28.873 --> 39:32.044
I can't believe
you're really asking that.

39:32.045 --> 39:33.378
You know why.

39:33.379 --> 39:36.113
It's your shoulder I've cried
on time and time again.

39:36.114 --> 39:39.818
You can't possibly think that
there's anything between us.

39:41.153 --> 39:43.054
There was once.

39:43.055 --> 39:44.656
At the lake?

39:44.657 --> 39:46.392
No, I mean long before.

39:46.393 --> 39:47.558
You had a life.

39:47.559 --> 39:50.694
You-- It was good before
it was bad, wasn't it?

39:50.695 --> 39:52.062
You have two great kids together.

39:52.063 --> 39:53.130
Libby.

39:53.131 --> 39:55.699
No, I know it's
not a storybook romance.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.036
But it could work.

39:57.037 --> 40:00.772
Don't you want to give
your kids a real family?

40:00.773 --> 40:03.408
Two parents under the same roof,

40:03.409 --> 40:05.678
having dinner every single night?

40:07.646 --> 40:10.381
I know I want that for my kids.

40:10.382 --> 40:12.850
And if you had it, too,

40:12.851 --> 40:16.851
then... wouldn't that
just solve everything?

40:24.630 --> 40:26.565
You're in a good mood.

40:37.943 --> 40:41.146
They both make you
look very, very pregnant.

40:47.052 --> 40:50.120
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered together here

40:50.121 --> 40:53.525
in the presence of God and
in the face of this company

40:53.526 --> 40:57.995
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony.

40:57.996 --> 41:00.664
"All property now
owned or later acquired

41:00.665 --> 41:02.566
by either party shall remain

41:02.567 --> 41:05.435
and be their discrete
and separate property."

41:05.436 --> 41:09.808
It is not by any to be
entered into unadvisedly or lightly,

41:09.809 --> 41:13.845
but reverently, discreetly, and solemnly.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.480
"Mr. Johnson
consents to Mrs. Johnson

41:16.481 --> 41:19.049
retaining primary custody of any child

41:19.050 --> 41:22.853
that results from the marriage
and agrees not to challenge

41:22.854 --> 41:25.489
nor seek to amend such an arrangement."

41:25.490 --> 41:27.457
If any person
can show just cause

41:27.458 --> 41:28.892
why they may not be joined together,

41:28.893 --> 41:30.961
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

41:30.962 --> 41:32.898
"The parties hereby acknowledge

41:32.899 --> 41:35.533
they are entering into the marriage

41:35.534 --> 41:37.903
with no expectations of cohabitation,

41:37.904 --> 41:41.906
no expectations of marital relations,

41:41.907 --> 41:46.377
no expectations of
faithfulness or celibacy."

41:46.378 --> 41:49.514
Will you love him, comfort him,

41:49.515 --> 41:52.784
honor and keep him in
sickness and in health?

41:52.785 --> 41:56.421
"Until such time as
the marriage is dissolved."

41:56.422 --> 41:58.557
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.425
Sign here and here.

42:00.426 --> 42:01.894
You may kiss the bride.

42:15.474 --> 42:17.809
The minister just left.

42:17.810 --> 42:20.511
You can take that tie off.

42:20.512 --> 42:23.015
You want to know what's ironic?

42:23.016 --> 42:26.818
Audrey and I split up over having kids.

42:26.819 --> 42:29.520
She wanted one of her own.

42:29.521 --> 42:32.123
I said two was enough for me.

42:32.124 --> 42:33.658
I was done.

42:33.659 --> 42:35.792
You could have had more.

42:35.793 --> 42:37.060
You're good with kids.

42:37.061 --> 42:39.665
Just not so good
with wives, apparently.

42:40.766 --> 42:43.502
You'll find someone, George.

42:44.803 --> 42:46.671
Another irony.

42:46.672 --> 42:47.938
My bride on our wedding day

42:47.939 --> 42:51.109
encouraging me that there
are other fish in the sea.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.780
Do you want this?

42:55.781 --> 42:57.783
Sure.

43:00.452 --> 43:02.554
Wait.

43:03.822 --> 43:05.023
A toast.

43:06.658 --> 43:08.559
What should we toast?

43:10.429 --> 43:12.029
To the baby.

43:12.030 --> 43:14.832
To a healthy baby.

43:14.833 --> 43:16.701
Look.

43:16.702 --> 43:19.070
And to love.

43:19.071 --> 43:21.873
To the love that made her.

43:22.940 --> 43:25.110
There was love that night, Gin.

43:25.111 --> 43:26.644
Tell me there wasn't.

43:26.645 --> 43:28.578
I was a wreck, George.

43:28.579 --> 43:29.982
Only at first.

43:32.451 --> 43:34.685
It was good, Gin.

43:34.686 --> 43:36.654
You can't have sex like that

43:36.655 --> 43:38.490
without feeling something
deeper for the person.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.825
Actually, you can.

43:40.826 --> 43:43.159
Sometimes the body just takes over.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.130
A phenomenon you've
documented, no doubt.

43:45.131 --> 43:50.222
You ever wonder if th--
if this work has ruined you?

43:50.257 --> 43:52.802
It has certainly
lined your pockets, mister.

43:52.803 --> 43:54.838
I'm not saying--
Okay, yes.

43:54.839 --> 43:58.041
It has made you someone you
have always wanted to be.

43:58.042 --> 43:59.845
But it has ruined you, too.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.979
How could it not?

44:01.980 --> 44:03.914
You look at people having sex all day.

44:03.915 --> 44:05.849
You-- you study how their
parts fit together.

44:05.850 --> 44:07.684
That is not all we do.

44:07.685 --> 44:09.922
The girl I married was a romantic.

44:09.923 --> 44:13.457
She stuffed love notes in my pockets.

44:13.458 --> 44:15.560
She...

44:15.561 --> 44:16.961
On our anniversary,

44:16.962 --> 44:19.064
she made us get in the
shower with our clothes on

44:19.065 --> 44:21.165
to re-create our first kiss...

44:21.166 --> 44:24.870
on that rainy street corner in Chicago.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.041
What happened that to girl?

44:31.510 --> 44:33.377
She grew up.

44:33.378 --> 44:36.846
Grew up to plan a divorce
the morning of her wedding,

44:36.847 --> 44:39.783
to have a lover whose
wife hosts the ceremony.

44:39.784 --> 44:41.420
What's sacred to you, Gin?

44:43.088 --> 44:44.821
This was sacred once.

44:44.822 --> 44:47.157
This ring once meant that
we would love each other

44:47.158 --> 44:48.858
until they put us in the ground.

44:48.859 --> 44:51.563
And now it means that no
one can ask any questions.

44:51.564 --> 44:53.998
I believe in love.

44:53.999 --> 44:57.435
What do you believe in?

44:57.436 --> 45:00.371
Our work has been seen by some

45:00.372 --> 45:04.372
as an attempt to weaken the
institution of marriage.

45:04.676 --> 45:07.077
As anyone who
knows us can tell you,

45:07.078 --> 45:09.512
nothing could be further from the truth.

45:09.513 --> 45:12.884
Successful marriage
demands successful communication,

45:12.885 --> 45:16.387
a relationship of honesty and openness

45:16.388 --> 45:17.754
between husband and wife.

45:17.755 --> 45:19.122
Any day now.

45:19.123 --> 45:22.928
The most basic, the most
necessary form of communication

45:22.929 --> 45:24.528
in any marriage is sex.

45:24.529 --> 45:29.066
Sexual inadequacy is now
the number-one cause of divorce.

45:29.067 --> 45:31.902
That, to us, is unacceptable.

45:31.903 --> 45:34.004
The primary focus of our work

45:34.005 --> 45:36.842
is not simply the
physiological study of sex...

45:36.843 --> 45:39.477
If it's a boy, Scott.

45:39.478 --> 45:41.077
And if it's a girl, uh, Lisa.

45:41.078 --> 45:43.382
- Geez.
- To the contrary,

45:43.383 --> 45:47.382
the goal of our work has
always been to help couples

45:47.419 --> 45:51.088
develop a meaningful and
mutual sexual relationship.

45:51.089 --> 45:53.757
We believe that to be the basis

45:53.758 --> 45:56.092
of every healthy and happy marriage.

45:56.093 --> 45:59.631
So, in that light,
I would like to raise my glass

45:59.632 --> 46:03.768
to the two people without
whom this book, our work,

46:03.769 --> 46:06.737
would be impossible.

46:06.738 --> 46:10.675
To our spouses,
Libby Masters and George Johnson.

46:12.678 --> 46:13.811
To you.

46:15.079 --> 46:17.049
...and safeguard the monarchy,

46:17.050 --> 46:22.507
I was given no choice but to
part with my dear spouse,

46:22.542 --> 46:23.554
the princess.

46:23.555 --> 46:29.960
The country may heal from the
loss of this magnificent woman.

46:35.534 --> 46:37.369
But I shall not.

46:49.681 --> 46:51.782
Vir-- Virginia?

46:51.783 --> 46:53.851
Ohh.

46:53.852 --> 46:56.487
They told me to walk, so I'm walking.

46:56.488 --> 46:58.888
Well, right now, I'm
leaning, but I was walking.

46:58.889 --> 47:00.523
I'm sorry. There was traffic.

47:00.524 --> 47:02.659
Oh, I didn't mean
for you to come, Bill.

47:02.660 --> 47:04.394
The-- the spotting just frightened me.

47:04.395 --> 47:05.695
It's perfectly normal.

47:05.696 --> 47:07.731
I know, but I
just didn't remember

47:07.732 --> 47:09.532
the bleeding from the times before.

47:09.533 --> 47:11.801
Heck, I don't remember anything
from the times before.

47:11.802 --> 47:13.403
I do know that, if a newborn cries,

47:13.404 --> 47:15.605
it's supposed to be one
of five things, right.

47:15.606 --> 47:18.508
Hunger, wetness, pain, fatigue,
and I just-- I can't remember.

47:18.509 --> 47:20.143
I can't remember what the fifth thing is.

47:20.144 --> 47:21.678
- Gas.
- Gas!

47:21.679 --> 47:22.879
Gas.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.748
It'll come back to you.
Just like riding a bike.

47:24.749 --> 47:26.149
I don't know how to ride a bike.

47:26.150 --> 47:27.550
You don't know
how to ride a bike?

47:27.551 --> 47:28.685
- No.
- Really?

47:28.686 --> 47:29.619
I didn't know that.

47:29.620 --> 47:30.854
Why would you know that?

47:30.855 --> 47:32.489
Well, I thought I
knew most things about you.

47:32.490 --> 47:33.623
That's a pretty big thing not to know.

47:34.825 --> 47:36.159
Okay, let's get you back to bed.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.393
Breathe. Try to breathe.

47:37.394 --> 47:38.161
I am!

47:38.162 --> 47:39.963
No, you're holding--
No, no.

47:39.964 --> 47:41.831
The most important thing is not--

47:41.832 --> 47:42.899
Don't-- don't bear down.

47:42.900 --> 47:44.801
I'm trying not to.

47:44.802 --> 47:45.737
Distract me.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.004
What?

47:47.005 --> 47:48.738
Distract me!
Tell me something.

47:48.739 --> 47:50.640
Uh, okay.

47:50.641 --> 47:53.910
Uh, you know,
Lester says the Riordan's on 7th

47:53.911 --> 47:55.514
has the book in the window.

47:55.515 --> 47:58.783
Apparently there's a whole display.

47:58.784 --> 48:01.818
Perhaps we could, uh-- perhaps
we could do a signing there.

48:01.819 --> 48:03.119
I mean, not right away, of course,

48:03.120 --> 48:04.621
but, uh, when you're feeling up to it.

48:04.622 --> 48:05.724
Something else!

48:06.858 --> 48:08.426
Uh, something else.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.929
Uh, uh, well, it occurred
to me on the way over

48:11.930 --> 48:14.464
that maybe finally we've
amassed enough data

48:14.465 --> 48:17.500
to be able to publish an article
about performance anxiety.

48:17.501 --> 48:19.070
Bill! For Christ's sake!

48:19.071 --> 48:20.871
Oh, God!

48:20.872 --> 48:23.140
Uh...

48:23.141 --> 48:27.141
♪ oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling ♪

48:27.612 --> 48:31.515
♪ from Glen to Glen and
down the mountainside ♪

48:31.516 --> 48:35.686
♪ the summer's gone and all
the flowers are dying ♪

48:35.687 --> 48:39.089
♪ 'tis you, 'tis you must
go and I must bide ♪

48:39.090 --> 48:41.559
♪ oh, Danny boy ♪

48:41.560 --> 48:43.760
It stopped! It stopped!
It-- it stopped.

48:43.761 --> 48:45.128
Please stop. You can stop.

48:45.129 --> 48:46.696
Lay back for now.

48:47.834 --> 48:49.700
Okay, that's it.

48:49.701 --> 48:51.902
That's it. In you go.

48:51.903 --> 48:55.540
That's it. That's it.

48:57.075 --> 49:00.444
You didn't know that I
could sing, did you?

49:00.445 --> 49:05.422
So, now we're even.

49:05.951 --> 49:07.719
Uh, how far apart are they?

49:07.720 --> 49:10.454
Oh...

49:10.455 --> 49:13.891
The last one was about five minutes ago.

49:13.892 --> 49:15.158
Five minutes?

49:15.159 --> 49:16.793
What, and they haven't started sedation?

49:16.794 --> 49:18.061
I'm getting a nurse.

49:18.062 --> 49:20.098
No. I want to be awake for it.

49:20.099 --> 49:21.966
Are you sure?

49:21.967 --> 49:23.900
Dr. Handleman said it's fine.

49:23.901 --> 49:25.501
More and more women are doing it.

49:25.502 --> 49:27.070
Oh, yes, but I wouldn't recommend

49:27.071 --> 49:28.438
you put yourself through that.

49:28.439 --> 49:30.106
You found your spotting alarming.

49:30.107 --> 49:31.908
The amount of blood from a vaginal birth

49:31.909 --> 49:33.576
can be, well, prodigious.

49:33.577 --> 49:35.879
And if there complications,
you don't want to be privy

49:35.880 --> 49:38.481
to the conversations that
go on in the delivery room.

49:38.482 --> 49:39.616
It can be distressing.

49:39.617 --> 49:41.985
They put me
under for the first two.

49:41.986 --> 49:45.388
And I always felt
like I missed something.

49:45.389 --> 49:47.759
One minute, you're reading a magazine,

49:47.760 --> 49:50.861
and the next, you wake up to this--

49:50.862 --> 49:53.130
this creature...

49:53.131 --> 49:56.400
swaddled and shiny clean.

49:59.371 --> 50:02.140
They were-- they were so beautiful.

50:04.075 --> 50:06.142
I always felt like they were presents

50:06.143 --> 50:08.880
somebody else had picked out
for me when I wasn't around.

50:11.883 --> 50:14.486
I wasn't around.

50:16.655 --> 50:20.025
The truth is, I wasn't
there, even when I was.

50:21.826 --> 50:25.497
I thought this was my chance,
Bill, to do things different,

50:25.498 --> 50:26.864
but what's changed?

50:26.865 --> 50:28.131
I'm the same person that I was always was.

50:28.132 --> 50:29.632
What made me think that I could do it?

50:29.633 --> 50:31.668
You might surprise yourself.

50:31.669 --> 50:34.137
You might, uh-- might find
yourself capable of things

50:34.138 --> 50:35.705
that you didn't know were possible.

50:35.706 --> 50:37.840
Look at my track record, Bill.

50:37.841 --> 50:38.841
I've failed twice.

50:38.842 --> 50:41.077
I obviously don't have what it takes,

50:41.078 --> 50:44.013
the patience and the focus
and the selflessness.

50:44.014 --> 50:45.715
I'm terrible at all of it.

50:47.084 --> 50:49.986
Then please explain our
success, won't you?

50:49.987 --> 50:53.892
Since, you know, that requires
every single one of those things

50:53.893 --> 50:56.627
from you--
patience, focus, sacrifice.

50:56.628 --> 50:58.127
You parented this book, Virginia.

50:58.128 --> 51:00.432
You helped bring it into the world,

51:00.433 --> 51:03.767
after the longest labor
in history, 10 years.

51:03.768 --> 51:05.803
And now here it is.

51:05.804 --> 51:07.972
Weight-- 1 pound, 14 ounces.

51:07.973 --> 51:09.974
Length-- 384 pages.

51:09.975 --> 51:11.942
Half you, half me.

51:11.943 --> 51:13.943
Are you not hearing me?

51:13.944 --> 51:16.412
That's the book, Bill.
That's the work.

51:16.413 --> 51:17.914
That, I can do.
I'm good at that.

51:17.915 --> 51:19.782
I'm talking about when I go home.

51:19.783 --> 51:22.652
That's the problem, when I try
to focus on just being a mother.

51:22.653 --> 51:24.954
You're a failure because
you care about other things?

51:24.955 --> 51:26.992
No, because I care
about other things more.

51:33.498 --> 51:35.166
What if that is just the
simple truth of it?

51:36.401 --> 51:37.535
Hmm?

51:38.770 --> 51:40.604
That I'm a woman

51:40.605 --> 51:44.605
incapable of putting her
kids before her work?

51:45.543 --> 51:47.978
Okay.

51:47.979 --> 51:50.414
Okay, what if it is?

51:50.415 --> 51:52.717
Then I need to try harder.

51:52.718 --> 51:55.853
Yes, much harder.

51:55.854 --> 51:58.688
I-I need to spend more time at home, Bill.

51:58.689 --> 52:01.724
I need to leave work early.
I need to come in later.

52:01.725 --> 52:04.460
I need to take all the qualities
that make me good at my job,

52:04.461 --> 52:06.498
and I need to apply
them to being a mother.

52:06.998 --> 52:08.465
I see.

52:08.466 --> 52:10.533
So you think that's
what every child needs,

52:10.534 --> 52:11.868
- a mother who's at home?
- Yes!

52:11.869 --> 52:15.440
Well, I had a mother
at home all day, every day.

52:15.441 --> 52:16.608
You too, yes?

52:18.376 --> 52:20.979
Did that make you feel happy?
Loved?

52:22.080 --> 52:24.615
Or oppressed by the attention?

52:24.616 --> 52:26.750
Suffocated by their resentment

52:26.751 --> 52:30.420
of being stuck doing the same
thing day in and day out.

52:30.421 --> 52:31.587
Maybe if those women

52:31.588 --> 52:33.689
had taken off their aprons
and ventured outside,

52:33.690 --> 52:37.558
held their own against men,
felt their worth in the world,

52:37.593 --> 52:39.264
and brought all that
home to their children,

52:39.299 --> 52:40.484
maybe their kids wouldn't
have spent all that time

52:40.519 --> 52:41.431
wanting to be free of them.

52:41.432 --> 52:43.132
I don't know, Bill.

52:43.133 --> 52:45.501
Perhaps it's your
ambivalence that's the problem,

52:45.502 --> 52:47.570
t-t-that you-- you live in a
constant state of apology

52:47.571 --> 52:48.571
to your children.

52:48.572 --> 52:50.141
What if-- what if you showed this baby

52:50.142 --> 52:53.377
that you were choosing
to pursue your passion,

52:53.378 --> 52:55.445
not-- not over him, but for him.

52:55.446 --> 52:57.613
You know, so that every single night,

52:57.614 --> 52:59.749
you could bring him home
a piece of the world,

52:59.750 --> 53:02.754
a world that you are working
to change for the better.

53:02.755 --> 53:04.888
I mean...

53:04.889 --> 53:07.692
after all, isn't that
the point of the book,

53:07.693 --> 53:09.593
that we shine a light on--

53:09.594 --> 53:12.395
on the infinite variations
of a single act?

53:12.396 --> 53:14.766
You know, we were on to
something, Virginia,

53:14.767 --> 53:16.433
something important.

53:16.434 --> 53:19.437
Maybe there is more than just
one way to do most things,

53:19.438 --> 53:21.605
including being a mother.

53:21.606 --> 53:26.428
Maybe, years from now,
we'll look back on the ones

53:26.463 --> 53:27.443
who gave up everything for their children,

53:27.444 --> 53:29.912
and we will say,
"Oh, you poor things."

53:29.913 --> 53:33.051
Look! Look at how much
more you could have been."

53:35.620 --> 53:37.122
You...

53:37.123 --> 53:40.557
You are leading the way
in so much, Virginia.

53:40.558 --> 53:42.694
Why not this, too?

53:48.500 --> 53:50.734
Bill.

53:50.735 --> 53:52.603
Another?

53:52.604 --> 53:54.804
Please get the nurse.

53:54.805 --> 53:56.038
- Please.
- Okay.

53:56.039 --> 53:58.376
- I think it's time.
- Yeah, yeah.

54:11.456 --> 54:12.723
Excuse me.

54:12.724 --> 54:14.526
Uh, I'm looking for Virginia Johnson.
