02:12.591 --> 02:13.884
As-salamu alaykum.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.469
My name is Khadija Young.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.055
I am the Iraqi bureau chief
for ITT Europe.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.517
My... my contact is Lisa Miller
in the London office.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.268
Her information is on this ID.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.440
I'm a journalist.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.578
Under Article 4 and Article 79
of the Geneva Convention

02:41.662 --> 02:43.121
y-you cannot touch me.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.542
This soldier is unconscious.
He needs medical attention.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.710
I'm Muslim, sir, I am Muslim.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.088
Please, just tell me
what you want to know.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.340
What do you want to know?
Ask me something.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.424
Ask me something!

02:54.967 --> 02:56.385
My name is Khadija Young!

02:56.468 --> 02:58.929
I'm the foreign correspondent
for ITT News.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.639
My address is 1420...

03:11.567 --> 03:12.985
Please, please, please.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.946
I'll talk to you.
I'll talk to you.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.240
I'll tell you anything
you wanna know. Please...

03:18.824 --> 03:20.409
Please help me, please...

03:46.185 --> 03:47.895
- Where am I?
- I don't...

03:48.979 --> 03:50.022
I don't know.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.404
Are you shot?

03:59.281 --> 04:01.867
You were in the Marine
Security Guard in the convoy.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.328
Looks like you're shot.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.122
I was coming in and out there.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.583
Did you talk?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.586
I didn't.
I didn't tell him anything useful.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.088
You talked.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.468
Name, job title, address.
That's it.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.303
What'd he ask you?

04:22.804 --> 04:24.640
- What did he ask you?
- Nothing.

04:25.724 --> 04:26.892
Lightweight.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.366
I'm... I'm a journalist.

04:43.659 --> 04:47.079
The US Embassy will reward you
if you could just

04:47.162 --> 04:49.248
send word of our capture
to them.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.167
Please. You can help us,
OK?

04:53.252 --> 04:55.170
Please.
Please, they'll reward you.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.260
Where are you taking him?

06:05.991 --> 06:07.576
Shh, shh, shh...

06:21.548 --> 06:22.633
Look at me.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.888
Oh, fuck!

06:28.180 --> 06:29.515
Ow!

06:30.432 --> 06:31.475
Look at me.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.065
- What is your name?
- Khadija Young.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.816
Are you an American citizen?

06:40.234 --> 06:41.193
Yes.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.653
What are you doing in Mosul?

06:42.945 --> 06:44.238
I'm a journalist.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.073
Oh, fuck!

06:50.369 --> 06:51.578
What is your name?

06:51.662 --> 06:52.871
Khadija Young.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.831
- Are you an American citizen?
- Yes.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.500
What are you doing in Mosul?

06:57.251 --> 06:59.461
I'm a journalist for ITT
International News.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.388
- What is your name?
- Kat Young.

07:10.222 --> 07:11.932
- Are you an American citizen?
- Yes.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.851
What are you doing in Mosul?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.061
I'm a journalist.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.021
Oh, fuck! Look me up!

07:18.105 --> 07:21.358
Use the internet!
I am an accredited journalist.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.277
An overseas correspondent.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.486
What are you doing in Mosul?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.488
I'm a fucking ITT journalist!

07:26.572 --> 07:28.323
The grey-haired man
in the convoy worked in

07:28.407 --> 07:29.700
- the Foreign Service.
- Bullshit!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.243
- He told me you worked in the embassy.
- Bullshit!

07:31.326 --> 07:33.287
He told me so just before I shot him.
He was not lying.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.539
You had no right! You had no
right to attack our convoy!

07:35.622 --> 07:37.291
There is an embassy in Baghdad.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.835
There is a consulate two and a half
hours away in Kirkuk.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.546
There's a consulate one and a half
hours away in Erbil.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.215
But there's no consulate in Mosul.

07:46.717 --> 07:47.759
So.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.929
What are you doing in Mosul?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.308
I'm an overseas correspondent

07:54.850 --> 07:56.643
in the foreign bureau at ITT...

08:02.608 --> 08:03.775
Look at me.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.904
Look at me.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.824
What is your name?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.535
Kat Young.

08:14.244 --> 08:15.996
What are you doing in Mosul?

08:17.873 --> 08:18.999
I am...

08:21.668 --> 08:23.545
I'm on a diplomatic mission.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.258
What do you do
for the state department?

08:28.383 --> 08:33.096
I write freelance as an overseas
correspondent for ITT News.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.140
- Do you know who Hassan Atwa is?
- No.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.393
- Do you know who Hassan Atwa is?
- Yes.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.062
- Do you know who Ahmed Yasin is?
- Yes!

08:40.145 --> 08:41.730
- Do you know who Saed Mohammed is?
- Yes!

08:41.813 --> 08:44.608
Have you, or anyone you know, been
responsible for the death of an Iraqi?

08:44.691 --> 08:45.984
- Yes!
- Are you CIA?

08:46.068 --> 08:47.694
No!

08:56.245 --> 08:57.412
What is your name?

08:59.498 --> 09:00.874
What is your name?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.383
What's your name?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.051
My name is Kat Young.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.761
What are you doing in Mosul?

09:15.514 --> 09:16.557
I w...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.309
I work for the state department.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.207
Shh. It's OK.

09:42.708 --> 09:43.750
It's OK.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.464
Good. Good, good, good.

10:09.026 --> 10:09.943
I...

10:10.986 --> 10:12.779
I didn't even want to go to Mosul.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.658
Everyone else...
Everyone else was in Basra.

10:16.742 --> 10:17.743
I was just...

10:18.410 --> 10:21.121
I was just filling in.
I didn't ask for any of this.

10:30.756 --> 10:34.009
The man who took your thumbnail...
Hamza.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.221
He said that you'd be easy to break.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.434
What would you do?

10:43.560 --> 10:44.895
Would you be easy?

10:48.524 --> 10:50.150
If you act like a victim

10:50.817 --> 10:52.152
people will victimise you.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.739
You wouldn't talk?

11:06.166 --> 11:09.044
That guard called you Oualid.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.008
The kunya for Oualid
is "Abu Khalid".

11:16.927 --> 11:18.971
I know you're from Mosul.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.766
Your accent is Maslawi

11:24.268 --> 11:26.061
that's the one I always have
trouble with.

11:27.437 --> 11:32.067
So that makes you Oualid Chalabi

11:33.443 --> 11:35.028
of the Ummah Brotherhood.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.952
So I know your name.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.706
I know where you're from.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.127
And I know what you're doing in Mosul.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.506
Chalabi...

11:55.507 --> 11:57.384
Chalabi is a Shiite name.

11:58.719 --> 11:59.970
Mosul is Sunni.

12:01.805 --> 12:05.058
There can't be that many Chalabis
left here.

12:07.769 --> 12:11.231
Pretty sure Special Activities Division
could make a list.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.902
So I can find your family.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.906
I can find out where you live.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.077
So you don't need to talk, Oualid.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.165
I can find out everything about you.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.259
What do you think I do
in the State Department?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.220
I think you work in the foreign service.

12:41.303 --> 12:45.349
I work part time as a translator
to fulfil my work visa.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.060
Then how do you know about
the Special Activities Division?

12:48.143 --> 12:50.562
Because my name is Khadija Young

12:50.646 --> 12:55.108
and I am the foreign correspondent
for ITT International News

12:55.192 --> 12:57.444
and that is what I'm doing
in Mosul.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.419
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?

13:22.094 --> 13:23.220
I see fear.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.432
It was nice to meet you.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.851
Oh, no.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.436
The pleasure is all mine.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.408
We've only just begun.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.131
You took off your blindfold?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.343
They took it off for me.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.723
I'm gonna take a look at your stomach.

14:50.641 --> 14:51.642
OK.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.821
They gave you a doctor?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.449
I didn't see his diploma.

15:08.367 --> 15:12.120
Hmm. Must have been state school.
Even I could do better than this.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.330
Prove it.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.627
That good, huh?

15:19.378 --> 15:20.587
Could be worse.

15:21.713 --> 15:22.798
How?

15:23.799 --> 15:25.008
Could have been me.

15:33.684 --> 15:34.768
Played football.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.603
Tore my ACL.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.397
Hurt about this much.

15:39.815 --> 15:40.941
You'll be alright.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.320
Your hula-hooping days are over.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.285
Hey, now.

15:52.578 --> 15:53.537
Calm down.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.965
Lost my whole crew today.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.633
I don't think we should dwell on it.

16:07.885 --> 16:08.886
Yeah?

16:09.052 --> 16:11.388
Yeah. We need to focus
on what we can control.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.765
We move forward. We strategise.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.101
What are you, anyways?

16:16.894 --> 16:18.687
Politician, diplomat?

16:19.605 --> 16:20.731
I'm a journalist.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.066
Written anything I heard of?

16:23.275 --> 16:25.027
I work for ITT Europe.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.112
Never heard of it.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.281
Well, I'm the Iraqi Bureau Chief.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.200
How many people in that bureau?

16:31.575 --> 16:32.492
Just me.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.037
So why do they call it a bureau?

16:35.579 --> 16:38.832
Look, do you know how many news outlets
can keep full-time foreign bureaus?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.959
You're not even full-time?

16:41.084 --> 16:42.628
I'm sorry, am I on trial here?

16:42.711 --> 16:44.379
Yeah. You are.

16:44.588 --> 16:45.756
What is your problem?

16:45.839 --> 16:49.051
Put my life on the line to escort
a fucking journalist?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.761
And you're not even a real journalist?

16:50.844 --> 16:52.221
How is any of this my fault?

16:52.304 --> 16:53.764
Cos I don't wanna die for nothing!

16:54.598 --> 16:56.767
Well, that's even more reason
to stay focused.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.644
- We look for an opportunity...
- Lankford is dead.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.270
- Put our heads together...
- Taylor is dead.

17:00.354 --> 17:02.147
- Stay calm...
- The staff sergeant's dead.

17:02.231 --> 17:05.567
The DSS agent's dead.
My whole detachment is dead

17:05.651 --> 17:07.402
even the fucking diplomat!

17:08.111 --> 17:09.238
James Willett?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.031
He was the
Consulate Deputy Director.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.575
- Well, he was shot.
- Dead?

17:13.659 --> 17:14.742
Dead.

17:14.826 --> 17:15.743
So it's just us?

17:16.578 --> 17:17.663
Just us.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.063
What mosque is that?

17:45.440 --> 17:46.441
Mm...

17:46.817 --> 17:51.113
If we're in the centre of Mosul then
it's the Great Mosque of al-Nouri.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.284
The one with the leaning steeple?

17:55.826 --> 17:56.910
Minaret.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.204
Whatever.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.710
If we were in the centre of the market,
that mosque would be deafening.

18:07.171 --> 18:08.130
Mm.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.465
Must be a mile off?

18:12.593 --> 18:14.636
Due north, judging by the sunset.

18:16.054 --> 18:19.266
So what neighbourhood is a mile
due south of the mosque?

18:20.142 --> 18:21.310
Hayy al Jawsaq.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.189
It's near the airport.

18:29.318 --> 18:30.527
Lots of buildings.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.738
Easy to hide us.

18:37.910 --> 18:41.079
I'm not great with, uh, men

18:41.455 --> 18:46.376
especially... Southern jock
football types. No offense.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.045
I, uh...

18:50.047 --> 18:51.882
I didn't mean to piss you off earlier.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.303
Sorry I...

18:57.137 --> 18:58.305
shouted at you.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.642
Real sorry.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.980
I, uh... woke up on the wrong side
of the bed today.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.418
Our host is Abu Khalid

19:29.211 --> 19:30.963
founder of the Ummah Brotherhood.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.842
- I heard of him.
- Yeah.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.262
He bombed government buildings
in Baghdad and Fallujah.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.390
Kidnapped civilian contractors
from Syria.

19:41.765 --> 19:45.561
Blew up US army barracks in Kuwait
and tried for a US air base in Qatar.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.438
Jesus.

19:50.274 --> 19:52.234
Why's he torturing
two lowlifes like us?

19:53.819 --> 19:55.863
He thinks we have information.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.325
Do we?

20:12.212 --> 20:13.964
No one holds up under torture.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.300
There's a reason it's been around
for thousands of years

20:16.383 --> 20:17.968
because it fucking works.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.264
What did Abu Khalid ask you?

20:23.640 --> 20:26.018
He wanted to know
if I worked at the embassy.

20:28.687 --> 20:31.106
He asked me
if I worked at the embassy too.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.611
You think he wants to bomb
the embassy?

20:36.028 --> 20:38.822
That's what Abu Khalid does.
He bombs things.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.241
We have...

20:41.992 --> 20:44.411
embassy access codes,
security protocols.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.495
Mm-hmm.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.706
We do have valuable information.

20:47.748 --> 20:52.044
The embassy is the biggest target
in the country, 15,000 employees.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.253
Christ.

20:53.337 --> 20:57.007
Abu Khalid will keep us alive
as long as we can help him.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.093
As soon as we talk, he'll kill us.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.180
Let's say you're right.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.351
How many people would know
the Ummah Brotherhood

21:07.434 --> 21:09.061
is planning an attack on the embassy?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.896
As far as we know...

21:12.189 --> 21:13.315
two people.

21:14.525 --> 21:15.609
So what do we do?

21:16.527 --> 21:20.030
Step one, don't tell him anything.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.532
Step two?

21:21.865 --> 21:23.200
Get word to the embassy.

21:24.910 --> 21:25.869
Step three?

21:27.871 --> 21:28.997
Escape.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.610
Stop... Stop, stop!

21:59.069 --> 22:00.445
You don't have to do this.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.574
I haven't done anything.

22:03.657 --> 22:05.284
I don't know anything. Please.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.660
No, no, no.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.372
Please. Please. Please.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.626
No, no, no! Please, please don't!
Please don't!

22:14.960 --> 22:16.170
No, no!

22:29.808 --> 22:30.851
Hello.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.338
No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:59.505 --> 23:01.173
No, please don't. Please don't!

23:01.256 --> 23:02.883
Please don't! No, no, no!

24:22.171 --> 24:23.338
Khadija.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.925
You're named for Khadija al-Kubra

24:27.926 --> 24:29.303
the wife of the prophet.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.638
First follower of Islam.

24:32.431 --> 24:34.308
Mother of all Believers.

24:36.310 --> 24:38.103
Your boss in the grey hair.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.025
Do you think he had a right
to be in Iraq?

24:43.942 --> 24:47.613
I believe diplomats have a right
to travel without being murdered.

24:48.614 --> 24:49.781
Diplomats...

24:53.118 --> 24:54.161
May I?

25:00.626 --> 25:01.877
C'mere.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.756
It's OK. It's OK.

25:10.052 --> 25:11.220
I had a daughter.

25:16.642 --> 25:17.809
One day...

25:18.644 --> 25:20.437
I saw her crying in the street.

25:21.939 --> 25:23.357
I asked her what was wrong.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.653
And she said another girl
had pushed her.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.405
So I said

25:31.156 --> 25:32.616
"Why don't you push her back?"

25:36.411 --> 25:37.496
And she just...

25:39.039 --> 25:40.165
looked at me.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.584
With those big...

25:45.087 --> 25:46.421
big, brown eyes.

25:48.674 --> 25:50.676
And said, "Baba, if I didn't like it

25:51.385 --> 25:52.553
why should she?"

25:55.764 --> 25:57.015
She was clever.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.351
Like you.

26:01.562 --> 26:02.688
And tough.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.440
Much tougher than me.

26:05.983 --> 26:08.861
She only came up to my belt buckle,
but she ran the whole house.

26:15.409 --> 26:17.202
They burnt my house in a fireball.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.165
I wasn't there.

26:24.168 --> 26:25.252
She was.

26:30.591 --> 26:31.925
She was my only child.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.974
Was that before

26:40.475 --> 26:44.938
or after you bombed
US army barracks in Kuwait?

26:50.444 --> 26:54.406
I'm sorry about what happened
to your daughter, but...

26:55.908 --> 26:57.910
you put her in harm's way

26:58.535 --> 27:02.831
by living with non-combatants.
That's... that's on your head.

27:29.191 --> 27:30.901
I think it's on the diplomat's head.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.656
I did not invade your country.

27:36.490 --> 27:38.450
You invaded mine.

27:40.118 --> 27:42.037
And now half a million
civilians are dead.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.706
And you think I am the bad guy.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.294
Do you know what the most
important thing in life is?

27:51.964 --> 27:53.006
Freedom?

27:53.757 --> 27:54.967
Perseverance.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.135
More than intellect.

27:58.095 --> 27:59.263
More than birth.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.308
Fortune smiles on those
that never give up.

28:05.352 --> 28:06.478
Because...

28:07.145 --> 28:09.356
fate may be hard, for a day

28:10.148 --> 28:12.025
a month, a year.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.778
But one day

28:15.696 --> 28:17.322
when you least expect it

28:18.365 --> 28:19.825
fate takes a day off.

28:20.534 --> 28:22.160
And something good
sneaks through.

28:23.829 --> 28:26.665
And you have to catch
those moments of opportunity.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.168
Like you and your soldier friend...

28:31.336 --> 28:32.629
delivered to me

28:33.672 --> 28:34.923
opportunity.

28:37.843 --> 28:40.137
Contact the embassy.

28:41.346 --> 28:43.640
They will pay good money
for my release.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.310
How did you learn Arabic, Khadija?

28:52.107 --> 28:54.735
I was raised in Bahrain.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.863
I went to a British
International School.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.698
Your accent is American.

29:00.532 --> 29:03.577
My parents were victims
of restructuring.

29:04.328 --> 29:05.370
The, um...

29:06.288 --> 29:09.416
State Department
sent us back to the US.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.792
I...

29:11.793 --> 29:14.838
I went to a public high school in DC.

29:15.297 --> 29:18.509
Kiboshed my British accent
pretty damn quick.

29:20.928 --> 29:22.387
You didn't like high school.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.809
Everyone has a tough time
in high school.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.568
What was it?

29:44.243 --> 29:45.410
Was it a boy?

29:55.420 --> 29:57.923
When I attack the embassy,
the gates will close.

29:58.382 --> 30:00.425
The Marines will raise
the vehicle barriers.

30:00.509 --> 30:03.637
The employees will take their computers
and retreat to the panic rooms.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.722
You've practiced these
lockdown drills.

30:06.515 --> 30:07.766
So...

30:09.893 --> 30:11.311
you will teach me

30:12.187 --> 30:16.567
every procedure, every key card,
every door code.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.782
How long ago
did your daughter die?

30:25.450 --> 30:27.452
Would she about my age now?

30:36.336 --> 30:38.213
Her whole little body burned.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.176
Her skin...

30:43.218 --> 30:44.469
peeling off

30:45.470 --> 30:47.139
like a boiled tomato.

30:50.851 --> 30:52.352
Her charred hair...

30:55.272 --> 30:56.356
turned to ash.

31:00.277 --> 31:01.862
But she was still alive.

31:05.699 --> 31:06.992
I tried to...

31:08.243 --> 31:09.912
reach out and hold her

31:12.206 --> 31:13.540
one last time...

31:17.628 --> 31:20.631
but when I... reached out

31:21.048 --> 31:22.466
she screamed.

31:24.343 --> 31:25.469
The pain.

31:27.763 --> 31:29.431
I could not hold her.

31:31.308 --> 31:32.768
Only watch her die.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.902
I will not help you.

31:47.699 --> 31:50.160
I am named for
Khalid ibn al-Walid

31:51.286 --> 31:53.163
the companion of the Prophet

31:53.580 --> 31:54.957
a Sword of Allah.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.628
I have seen so much more than you.

32:02.256 --> 32:06.343
And I have survived...
so much more than you.

32:10.597 --> 32:12.182
Time is on my side...

32:14.101 --> 32:15.310
not yours.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.620
They might do mock executions.

32:34.329 --> 32:36.331
White torture. We should be prepared.

32:36.665 --> 32:37.791
White torture?

32:38.667 --> 32:41.378
Yeah.
Isolation. Sensory deprivation.

32:43.547 --> 32:44.965
Actually sounds kinda nice.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.427
They put a sack over your head,
turn the lights off

32:48.510 --> 32:51.763
and leave you to sit in the dark.
You lose your mind in a week.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.309
Yeah, we need to escape.

32:58.937 --> 33:01.190
I don't wanna just sneak away.

33:04.109 --> 33:05.569
I wanna nail these guys.

33:06.612 --> 33:09.656
How in the holy fuck
are we gonna "nail these guys"?

33:11.366 --> 33:13.660
And why do you care so much
about nailing terrorists

33:14.536 --> 33:16.830
if you're just a... journalist?

33:18.665 --> 33:19.875
Who are you really?

33:20.125 --> 33:21.210
Let go of me.

33:21.376 --> 33:25.631
Mr Khalid seems to think it was worth it
to attack your heavily-armed convoy

33:25.923 --> 33:28.050
take your ass hostage,
and interrogate the shit out of you.

33:28.133 --> 33:29.218
Let go of me.

33:29.301 --> 33:32.346
Now if I'm gonna die in here,
cos of you

33:33.263 --> 33:34.515
I have a right to know.

33:36.350 --> 33:37.434
Who are you?

33:39.353 --> 33:41.522
Do you know why they lock us
in a room together?

33:42.689 --> 33:43.774
C'mon.

33:44.441 --> 33:47.194
A bunch of religious guys,
locking an unmarried woman

33:47.277 --> 33:49.196
in a cell with an unmarried man?

33:50.030 --> 33:51.823
There's gotta be a pretty
damn good reason.

33:51.907 --> 33:53.367
So why'd they do it?

33:56.703 --> 33:58.330
So, talk.

34:06.380 --> 34:09.591
The army knows about this safe house.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.969
How do you know
which safe houses they know?

34:20.018 --> 34:21.645
JSOC formed a task force

34:21.770 --> 34:23.688
Special Activities Division,
Delta Force

34:23.772 --> 34:25.649
the 1st Brigade of the 4th Infantry.

34:25.732 --> 34:29.360
They're calling in drones to wipe out
every target on their list.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.822
The Army knows about this safe house.
It is on the damn list.

34:34.824 --> 34:36.743
I knew you weren't a fucking journalist.

34:39.079 --> 34:40.289
When's the strike?

34:40.664 --> 34:42.498
I have absolutely no idea.

34:47.713 --> 34:50.674
We just need to stay here
and keep them occupied.

34:51.007 --> 34:55.012
Sooner or later, the Army will call in
a strike and kill Abu Khalid.

34:56.388 --> 34:59.683
So we're supposed to just sit here
and get tortured until we die?

34:59.766 --> 35:00.934
That's your plan?

35:01.185 --> 35:02.686
No. That is not what I'm saying.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.730
You should be a motivational
fucking speaker.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.690
You are filling me with hope.

35:06.857 --> 35:09.151
Look, what does Abu Khalid want?

35:11.945 --> 35:13.030
Intel on the embassy.

35:13.488 --> 35:16.200
So we give it to him. Slowly.

35:16.617 --> 35:19.912
Layout, security protocols,
the access codes...

35:20.412 --> 35:21.538
But everything slightly wrong.

35:21.622 --> 35:24.666
We plan it out.
Rehearse it like lines in a play.

35:24.750 --> 35:25.918
Our stories jibe...

35:26.210 --> 35:28.545
We give him all the info,
slow as possible.

35:28.795 --> 35:32.299
It keeps us alive. And it keeps him
coming back to this safe house.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.384
It's not much.

35:35.219 --> 35:36.386
It's not nothing.

35:37.221 --> 35:39.306
And so, in the meantime, we...

35:40.682 --> 35:41.934
look for a way out?

35:43.560 --> 35:45.187
First, we plan.

35:46.688 --> 35:47.773
And then?

35:48.440 --> 35:49.525
Practise.

35:52.778 --> 35:54.530
Thirty-five Marines on guard.

35:56.198 --> 35:57.741
Five men to a detachment.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.117
Four hour shifts...

36:00.118 --> 36:02.287
Key card access
by the north gate house.

36:02.371 --> 36:05.707
Access code 537393...

36:05.999 --> 36:07.835
537393...

36:08.377 --> 36:10.379
537393...

36:10.504 --> 36:12.297
537393.

36:12.548 --> 36:14.716
537393...

36:49.168 --> 36:50.419
How do you feel?

36:52.880 --> 36:54.298
Walking on sunshine.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.176
I, uh...

36:57.801 --> 36:59.761
I saved you my vegetables.

37:00.554 --> 37:01.847
If you can call them that.

37:03.182 --> 37:04.266
No...

37:05.142 --> 37:06.310
thank you.

37:12.149 --> 37:13.275
Shit.

37:14.151 --> 37:15.194
I know.

38:18.298 --> 38:19.550
Amir.

38:20.175 --> 38:21.677
Saif, Imad...

38:23.762 --> 38:25.472
Amir, Saif, Imad.

38:27.599 --> 38:30.227
Amir, Saif, Imad.

38:41.363 --> 38:42.322
Oh!

38:51.707 --> 38:54.710
You're trying to fighting infection.
Your body's trying to heal you.

38:54.877 --> 38:55.794
Um...

38:56.837 --> 38:58.338
OK, uh...

38:58.547 --> 38:59.965
Take a deep breath.

39:00.257 --> 39:01.550
Hold it.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.969
Let it out slowly.

39:06.763 --> 39:08.140
Um, close your eyes.

39:09.183 --> 39:10.893
You're out in nature.

39:11.101 --> 39:12.186
Picture it.

39:13.437 --> 39:16.356
This is New-Age hippie bullshit.

39:16.481 --> 39:17.858
Just keep breathing.

39:18.567 --> 39:19.818
You're out in nature.

39:20.194 --> 39:22.905
Describe it to me.
Tell me where you are.

39:25.699 --> 39:26.783
The lake.

39:27.451 --> 39:29.912
OK. Tell me more about the lake.

39:31.205 --> 39:33.665
- This is some hippie bullshit.
- Tell me.

39:42.925 --> 39:44.760
Used to come up here with my dad.

39:49.306 --> 39:50.474
You could...

39:52.100 --> 39:55.354
practically stick your hand in the water
and pull up a spotted bass.

39:56.605 --> 39:57.981
Keep talking to me.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.240
You come up here at dawn

40:07.449 --> 40:10.536
mist... rising off the lake.

40:13.622 --> 40:16.416
And the current,
rocking your boat like...

40:18.502 --> 40:19.962
like you're lying in a hammock.

40:24.883 --> 40:26.927
Nothing but the smell of pine...

40:30.806 --> 40:34.101
and the loons,
calling across the water.

40:39.606 --> 40:41.066
You ever hear a loon?

40:44.403 --> 40:45.779
Wild sound, like...

40:47.531 --> 40:48.824
like a wolf's howl.

40:52.452 --> 40:55.414
Hearing that ancient sound
takes you back a thousand years.

41:01.211 --> 41:03.630
You feel like you're the first
person in the world.

41:07.759 --> 41:09.052
This lake...

41:09.845 --> 41:11.722
is your place, Luke.

41:12.848 --> 41:15.684
If they hurt you...
you come here.

41:16.894 --> 41:18.228
They can't touch you.

41:29.156 --> 41:30.490
Where do you go?

41:32.034 --> 41:33.368
When they torture you?

41:37.539 --> 41:39.041
You promise you won't laugh at me?

41:40.918 --> 41:42.252
Cannot make that promise.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.215
I, um...

41:49.301 --> 41:50.844
I go to Baghdad.

41:52.095 --> 41:53.597
I'm in the embassy

41:54.640 --> 41:58.268
my own office,
my name on the door.

41:59.853 --> 42:01.021
A promotion.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.441
That's what you picture?

42:05.025 --> 42:06.360
You said you wouldn't laugh.

42:06.485 --> 42:09.154
No, I didn't promise,
and I'm not laughing.

42:11.198 --> 42:12.115
Come on.

42:18.664 --> 42:20.582
I'm overdue a promotion.

42:21.708 --> 42:24.378
My boss can't even speak Arabic,
for Christ's sake.

42:25.963 --> 42:28.215
Just for once,
I want someone to call me

42:28.799 --> 42:31.009
"Operations Officer Young"

42:32.302 --> 42:33.804
instead of just "Kat".

42:36.598 --> 42:39.685
So yeah, that's what I picture
to get me through

42:41.103 --> 42:43.272
being rewarded for all this.

42:44.189 --> 42:46.149
Well, I think you deserve
the promotion

42:47.442 --> 42:48.694
maybe a parking spot.

42:51.947 --> 42:53.532
Do you have a call sign
at the embassy?

42:53.991 --> 42:55.450
Are you still making fun of me?

42:55.534 --> 42:57.661
No. I'm serious.

42:59.204 --> 43:02.416
No. I'm not important enough
to have a codename.

43:02.499 --> 43:03.542
Come on.

43:07.754 --> 43:10.674
The guys in CST
used to call me...

43:11.550 --> 43:12.718
Wildcat.

43:15.179 --> 43:16.388
Wildcat.

43:17.931 --> 43:19.224
That's pretty badass.

43:20.809 --> 43:22.519
They called you that
cos your name's Kat?

43:24.104 --> 43:25.230
Partly.

43:25.814 --> 43:27.941
You figure that all out by yourself?

43:28.150 --> 43:29.443
I sure did.

43:32.321 --> 43:33.405
What's the other part?

43:33.488 --> 43:35.199
I'm not telling you the other part.

43:36.158 --> 43:38.285
Kat, look at me.

43:39.953 --> 43:42.331
I'm not going anywhere.
Who am I gonna tell?

43:52.841 --> 43:54.426
The other part was...

43:56.178 --> 43:57.930
they were making fun of me.

43:59.223 --> 44:00.432
I, um...

44:01.308 --> 44:04.269
I don't drink, I don't go to bars.

44:05.646 --> 44:07.231
They thought I was...

44:08.273 --> 44:09.983
shy or a wimp, so...

44:11.693 --> 44:15.280
it was... It was funny
to call me Wildcat.

44:24.331 --> 44:25.749
What are you laughing at?

44:26.708 --> 44:28.085
Just proud of myself.

44:29.086 --> 44:30.128
Yeah?

44:31.630 --> 44:32.840
Got you to open up.

45:00.868 --> 45:02.202
Who are you?

45:05.747 --> 45:07.291
Are you a US citizen?

45:11.712 --> 45:13.547
What are you doing in Mosul?

45:21.597 --> 45:22.764
Who are you?

45:31.440 --> 45:32.774
Qusay Hadad...

45:33.775 --> 45:35.194
Nasser Bank.

45:35.944 --> 45:37.487
Account number...

45:37.905 --> 45:41.742
030-813-0129.

45:42.159 --> 45:46.413
030-813-0129.

45:46.788 --> 45:48.957
030-813...

46:39.883 --> 46:41.176
No. No, no, no.

46:42.177 --> 46:44.221
Say, "I consider you lawful."

46:44.805 --> 46:46.098
No, no, no.

46:46.223 --> 46:47.474
You are my rented woman.

46:47.558 --> 46:48.725
- No! Please..,
- Say it.

46:48.809 --> 46:50.269
Say it.

46:50.602 --> 46:51.687
No.

46:51.770 --> 46:53.397
If you say that, it will be lawful.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.190
- No! Please, please, don't!
- Say...

46:55.274 --> 46:56.275
Say it. Say it.

46:56.358 --> 46:57.860
Please don't do this to me!

46:57.943 --> 46:59.820
Please, no!

46:59.903 --> 47:01.655
Shh.

47:02.281 --> 47:03.448
Rape!

47:03.657 --> 47:05.117
- Rape!
- Shh! Don't...

47:05.742 --> 47:07.202
- Abu Khalid!
- Shh!

47:07.828 --> 47:09.705
Shh...

47:11.915 --> 47:13.041
Say it.

47:17.129 --> 47:18.422
No, please, no...

47:22.718 --> 47:24.511
- What do you want?
- Get him off me.

47:24.636 --> 47:26.847
- Why would I do this for you?
- Please. Please. Please!

47:27.472 --> 47:28.557
Are you CIA?

47:28.724 --> 47:30.017
- No.
- Are you CIA?

47:30.100 --> 47:31.268
- No.
- Are you CIA?

47:31.351 --> 47:32.728
No!

47:32.853 --> 47:34.146
No!

47:34.271 --> 47:35.731
Are you CIA!

47:37.691 --> 47:39.359
Yes!

47:43.280 --> 47:44.448
What is your rank?

47:44.656 --> 47:47.367
I'm a National Clandestine
Service Language Officer.

47:52.331 --> 47:53.498
A translator?

47:53.582 --> 47:56.710
Yeah. There were no
open slots for case officers.

47:56.877 --> 47:58.170
What about the journalism?

47:58.253 --> 48:00.255
I searched the internet,
I saw your articles.

48:00.339 --> 48:03.175
Translator is my official cover.
Journalism is my N.O.C.

48:03.258 --> 48:06.261
I don't wanna be a translator forever,
I wanna be a case officer.

48:08.222 --> 48:09.223
Then why aren't you?

48:09.389 --> 48:10.641
Take your pick.

48:11.058 --> 48:13.227
Cos I'm a woman,
cos I was raised overseas

48:13.310 --> 48:15.062
cos my C.O.S. is an officious prick

48:15.145 --> 48:18.190
and because I'm the sort of idiot
who gets themselves kidnapped.

48:18.273 --> 48:20.025
The grey-haired man in the truck.
He was CIA?

48:20.901 --> 48:22.194
Of course he was.

48:41.880 --> 48:43.841
Shh...

48:44.925 --> 48:46.009
It's OK.

48:48.887 --> 48:50.347
Thank you.

48:51.098 --> 48:52.474
Shh.

48:53.100 --> 48:54.351
It's OK now.

48:55.227 --> 48:56.311
It's OK.

49:03.861 --> 49:04.987
You're mine.

49:38.812 --> 49:41.648
Saif Shadid is an arms buyer
living in Khartoum

49:41.732 --> 49:43.817
under the name Abdul Shammas.

49:43.901 --> 49:46.904
Amir Halabi recruits fighters

49:46.987 --> 49:50.866
in Baghdad under the name
Rafid Rahal.

50:06.089 --> 50:08.800
The embassy compound
is the largest in the world.

50:09.551 --> 50:12.137
Big as Vatican City,
there's apartment buildings

50:12.513 --> 50:15.641
movie theatres, tennis courts,
an Olympic swimming pool...

50:16.391 --> 50:19.144
Uh, the buildings
are reinforced with concrete

50:19.269 --> 50:21.313
and deep security perimeters.

50:22.231 --> 50:26.026
A civilian RSO is in charge
of the Marine Security Guards

50:26.109 --> 50:27.736
and Diplomatic Security Service.

50:30.364 --> 50:31.949
Tell me about the soldiers.

50:33.116 --> 50:34.785
A hundred MSGs on base.

50:34.868 --> 50:36.036
Snipers on the roof.

50:36.370 --> 50:39.331
Um, the Local Guard Force
mans the gates.

50:40.457 --> 50:43.544
Suppose I enter at night,
through the north gate?

50:43.752 --> 50:45.295
You wouldn't get past
perimeter walls.

50:45.379 --> 50:47.631
- I will attack with gas.
- They have gasmasks.

50:47.714 --> 50:49.883
- It will slow them down.
- A siren goes off.

50:50.133 --> 50:51.301
The compound locks down.

50:51.343 --> 50:55.931
Every office is cut off
with heavy, code-locked doors.

50:58.058 --> 51:00.018
How do we get past
the north gatehouse?

51:00.602 --> 51:01.728
Key card entry.

51:02.145 --> 51:05.190
Access code 537393.

51:12.155 --> 51:15.701
Uh, there's 30 Marines
on night-watch.

51:16.910 --> 51:19.121
Five men to a detachment.
Eight-hour shifts.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.295
How are you feeling?

54:15.088 --> 54:16.798
They beat me like a rented mule.

54:19.927 --> 54:21.637
Mm. Still beats working.

54:29.811 --> 54:30.979
How do I look?

54:31.438 --> 54:33.398
You're... You're a little infected.

54:40.489 --> 54:41.532
Thank you.

54:47.829 --> 54:50.123
You're not a big complainer,
are you?

54:59.091 --> 55:01.426
You sure the Army
knows about this safe house?

55:02.261 --> 55:03.262
Yes.

55:03.762 --> 55:06.223
It's the whole reason
our convoy came to Mosul.

55:06.765 --> 55:08.684
Willett was visiting our assets.

55:08.976 --> 55:11.854
We don't know the whole network,
just a few spots, like this one.

55:12.980 --> 55:14.731
Then why haven't they struck yet?

55:17.860 --> 55:19.403
Um, maybe they're...

55:20.153 --> 55:23.282
They know we're here.
They don't want to kill us.

55:24.324 --> 55:26.159
Maybe they're preparing
a ground team.

55:31.665 --> 55:33.166
Can't you do anything?

55:36.545 --> 55:38.797
I'm not James fricking Bond.

55:39.965 --> 55:42.384
We're trained to gather information,
that's it.

55:43.135 --> 55:46.263
I majored in Psych
and minored in Sociology.

55:46.346 --> 55:48.557
I'm not the one you call
to kill a terrorist.

55:49.057 --> 55:50.976
I'm the one you call
to write a thesis about it.

55:53.353 --> 55:55.147
If I was Abu Khalid...

55:56.315 --> 55:58.859
I'd hide my safe house
right next to a mosque.

56:00.277 --> 56:01.862
So the US can't bomb it.

56:02.988 --> 56:03.947
Well...

56:04.656 --> 56:08.202
If I ever get round to running
a terrorist group

56:08.744 --> 56:10.662
I'll keep that in mind.

56:15.334 --> 56:16.418
Luke.

56:18.086 --> 56:20.255
I know all their names now.

56:21.465 --> 56:24.009
Their bank accounts. Phone numbers.

56:24.301 --> 56:26.220
The whole Ummah Brotherhood.

56:27.721 --> 56:29.264
If we survive this...

56:30.265 --> 56:32.184
I'll get a Distinguished
Intelligence Cross

56:32.267 --> 56:34.478
and you'll get
whatever they give Marines.

56:39.316 --> 56:40.567
Maybe...

56:41.485 --> 56:43.487
we'll figure out a way to escape.

56:46.573 --> 56:50.786
Fortune smiles on those
who never give up.

56:52.371 --> 56:53.539
Because...

56:55.415 --> 56:57.000
fate may be hard

56:57.751 --> 57:01.588
for a day, a week, a year...

57:04.174 --> 57:07.302
But when you least expect it

57:08.887 --> 57:10.556
fate takes a day off.

57:13.225 --> 57:15.310
And something good sneaks through.

57:46.967 --> 57:47.968
That...

57:51.305 --> 57:53.056
That fell off the bed!

57:53.140 --> 57:55.100
I had nothing to do with that,
I didn't have anything to do with that!

57:55.184 --> 57:56.602
Get on the bed! Now!

57:57.436 --> 57:59.396
Get on the bed!

57:59.438 --> 58:00.606
No! No!

58:00.898 --> 58:02.733
Wait! Wait...

58:02.816 --> 58:03.984
Please, I don't know...

58:05.277 --> 58:07.029
No, no, no, no!

58:07.196 --> 58:08.488
No! No, no!

58:08.822 --> 58:10.073
No! No!

58:10.199 --> 58:11.700
Please, come on, we're friends now!

58:11.783 --> 58:14.369
You and I, I'm on your side.
Please don't do this, please.

58:15.162 --> 58:16.747
Please!

58:18.874 --> 58:20.167
Stop! No!

58:20.250 --> 58:21.335
Please don't do this!

58:21.460 --> 58:22.628
No!

58:24.213 --> 58:25.130
Stop!

58:25.255 --> 58:26.715
Stop! Please!

58:34.306 --> 58:35.891
Please just stop!

58:43.774 --> 58:45.234
No, please, no!

58:52.741 --> 58:55.619
I... I told you everything.

58:59.122 --> 59:00.290
Ask me...

59:11.134 --> 59:12.302
I... I...

1:01:03.163 --> 1:01:04.623
Come here. Come on.

1:01:10.754 --> 1:01:12.506
Shh, shh, shh.

1:01:13.507 --> 1:01:14.591
It's OK.

1:01:20.514 --> 1:01:21.640
I told them.

1:01:28.105 --> 1:01:29.523
What did you tell them?

1:01:32.359 --> 1:01:33.527
I'm sorry.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:37.739
Luke, look at me.

1:01:38.907 --> 1:01:40.242
What did you tell them?

1:01:43.328 --> 1:01:45.247
Did you tell them
about the embassy codes?

1:01:48.292 --> 1:01:49.960
I told them about CIA.

1:01:52.254 --> 1:01:54.923
I told them the CIA
knows about this safe house.

1:01:55.257 --> 1:01:57.426
I told them they're planning
an airstrike.

1:01:58.385 --> 1:01:59.636
Could come any day.

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:10.898
I told them we've been lying
about the codes.

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:14.484
I told them...

1:02:16.612 --> 1:02:17.696
Why?

1:02:18.363 --> 1:02:20.532
Why? After all this, why now?

1:02:20.616 --> 1:02:21.700
Why? Why?

1:02:22.951 --> 1:02:25.412
- The only way to make them stop.
- Oh, my God.

1:02:25.579 --> 1:02:27.456
Oh, my God,
you goddamned lightweight!

1:02:27.539 --> 1:02:28.665
What did they do to you?

1:02:28.749 --> 1:02:32.127
What did they do to you
that they haven't done 100 times?

1:02:32.211 --> 1:02:33.462
I mean, did they beat you?

1:02:33.545 --> 1:02:34.922
- No.
- Did they rape you?

1:02:35.005 --> 1:02:35.923
God, no.

1:02:36.006 --> 1:02:38.467
Did they call you bad names
and hurt your fucking feelings?

1:02:38.550 --> 1:02:39.927
They didn't do anything!

1:02:44.723 --> 1:02:45.849
It was you.

1:02:47.434 --> 1:02:48.519
What?

1:02:49.269 --> 1:02:50.938
I heard you screaming for your life.

1:02:51.813 --> 1:02:55.484
They told me they'd kill you
if I didn't say anything, so I talked.

1:02:59.196 --> 1:03:00.572
What was I supposed to do?

1:03:04.493 --> 1:03:06.119
I wanted to save your life.

1:03:09.248 --> 1:03:10.457
Fuck!

1:03:11.416 --> 1:03:12.709
Fuck!

1:04:00.257 --> 1:04:01.425
Come on.

1:04:01.758 --> 1:04:02.801
Come on.

1:04:04.178 --> 1:04:05.637
It's OK. It's OK.

1:04:06.013 --> 1:04:06.972
It's OK.

1:04:07.681 --> 1:04:09.474
Shh, shh, shh.

1:04:10.642 --> 1:04:11.768
Here, come on.

1:04:13.437 --> 1:04:14.479
OK.

1:04:18.734 --> 1:04:20.485
- OK.
- I read once that, uh...

1:04:25.324 --> 1:04:26.658
your body can only...

1:04:27.910 --> 1:04:31.288
Your body can only produce...
pain endorphins

1:04:31.371 --> 1:04:32.915
for about 15 minutes

1:04:33.248 --> 1:04:34.958
before it starts running dry.

1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:46.470
Luke, you can take more.

1:04:46.970 --> 1:04:48.305
OK? There's more in you.

1:04:52.309 --> 1:04:53.560
I'm out of gas.

1:04:57.439 --> 1:04:59.858
You're probably gonna be
the last person I see alive.

1:05:01.610 --> 1:05:02.778
I'm glad it was you.

1:05:07.950 --> 1:05:09.743
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

1:05:12.579 --> 1:05:14.289
Wanted to make my dad proud.

1:05:18.418 --> 1:05:21.338
And do something with my life.
Make a difference.

1:05:26.093 --> 1:05:27.219
Be a hero?

1:05:30.347 --> 1:05:31.515
All my life.

1:05:34.852 --> 1:05:36.395
I didn't do much, did I?

1:05:38.814 --> 1:05:40.524
Went to Iraq and got shot...

1:05:45.362 --> 1:05:46.572
You're up to something.

1:05:49.908 --> 1:05:51.702
You wanna be a hero, Luke?

1:06:39.166 --> 1:06:40.959
You creepy bastard!

1:06:41.043 --> 1:06:43.003
- Sadistic son of a bitch!
- Abu Khalid!

1:06:43.587 --> 1:06:45.339
Abu Khalid!

1:07:12.282 --> 1:07:14.535
Stop! No! You're killing him!
Please stop, stop!

1:07:14.618 --> 1:07:15.994
No more! No more!

1:07:16.161 --> 1:07:17.162
No more!

1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:22.793
You've broken our trust.

1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:25.170
What goddamned trust?

1:07:42.563 --> 1:07:43.689
No, no, no!

1:07:44.565 --> 1:07:45.566
Oh, God...

1:07:47.359 --> 1:07:49.945
Come on. Come on.

1:07:55.284 --> 1:07:57.619
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1:07:57.703 --> 1:07:59.413
- Stay with me.
- I'm still here.

1:07:59.621 --> 1:08:01.498
OK... I'm so sorry.

1:08:01.999 --> 1:08:03.292
We knew it'd be bad.

1:08:03.417 --> 1:08:05.711
You... you don't deserve any of this.

1:08:06.128 --> 1:08:07.296
It's OK.

1:08:07.671 --> 1:08:08.964
I got something for you.

1:08:10.299 --> 1:08:11.425
You got it?

1:08:28.108 --> 1:08:29.193
You did it.

1:08:32.654 --> 1:08:34.156
It's up to you now, Kat.

1:08:34.907 --> 1:08:35.908
I know.

1:08:39.286 --> 1:08:40.746
It's gotta mean something.

1:08:42.831 --> 1:08:44.625
Everything we've been through.

1:08:46.167 --> 1:08:47.627
You gotta get these guys.

1:08:48.212 --> 1:08:49.379
I will, Luke.

1:08:56.761 --> 1:08:57.763
People...

1:08:58.471 --> 1:08:59.932
can only kick you...

1:09:00.557 --> 1:09:01.934
when you're laying down.

1:09:04.102 --> 1:09:05.312
When you stand up

1:09:07.064 --> 1:09:08.774
they've got to look you in the eye.

1:09:13.403 --> 1:09:14.529
Always stand up.

1:09:14.654 --> 1:09:16.406
Oh, God...

1:09:16.615 --> 1:09:17.783
Keep breathing.

1:09:18.158 --> 1:09:19.201
No, I...

1:09:19.493 --> 1:09:21.245
- No, I...
- Yes, you can.

1:09:21.328 --> 1:09:22.537
I can't take it.

1:09:22.746 --> 1:09:24.665
Just close your eyes.

1:09:24.747 --> 1:09:26.124
I want it to stop.

1:09:26.542 --> 1:09:28.085
Do you remember the lake?

1:09:28.669 --> 1:09:30.420
- Do you see the lake?
- I can't take it.

1:09:32.296 --> 1:09:33.674
The pine trees?

1:09:33.756 --> 1:09:37.094
The fishing line where it meets
the bobber in the water?

1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:41.139
I see it.

1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:43.225
Where are you?

1:09:46.228 --> 1:09:47.563
My uncle's skiff.

1:09:50.023 --> 1:09:51.024
Tell me.

1:09:57.447 --> 1:09:58.866
I got something on the line.

1:10:02.244 --> 1:10:03.537
Something good.

1:10:07.332 --> 1:10:08.333
I...

1:10:08.876 --> 1:10:10.085
I can feel it.

1:11:16.527 --> 1:11:17.861
Hey, no. No, no...

1:12:16.837 --> 1:12:18.463
Where...
where have you taken me?

1:12:18.714 --> 1:12:20.924
Somewhere where
your government doesn't know.

1:12:21.258 --> 1:12:23.552
Where they can never get to you

1:12:24.261 --> 1:12:25.804
and you can never escape.

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:39.484
Oh, goddamn it.

1:12:39.568 --> 1:12:40.861
You blew it, you blew it,
you blew it.

1:12:45.449 --> 1:12:46.658
How...

1:12:46.742 --> 1:12:49.328
How are you supposed to find me
when I don't even know where I am?

1:12:49.536 --> 1:12:50.537
OK.

1:12:51.288 --> 1:12:52.372
OK.

1:12:52.581 --> 1:12:53.790
OK.

1:12:54.082 --> 1:12:55.209
OK, OK.

1:13:03.425 --> 1:13:04.301
OK.

1:13:07.679 --> 1:13:09.097
Something's gotta give.

1:13:13.310 --> 1:13:14.520
Think. Come on.

1:13:28.575 --> 1:13:29.701
You need help.

1:13:30.577 --> 1:13:31.787
Anything, something.

1:13:31.870 --> 1:13:33.121
Please, I just need help.

1:14:17.541 --> 1:14:20.210
You hid me by the Great Mosque
of al-Nouri.

1:14:21.086 --> 1:14:22.921
So there are no drone strikes.

1:14:26.925 --> 1:14:28.635
You're afraid of bombs

1:14:29.386 --> 1:14:32.306
like the one
that crushed your house.

1:14:41.899 --> 1:14:43.192
Why are you angry, Oualid?

1:14:43.942 --> 1:14:47.112
Is it cos I kicked Hamza,
your crazy car mechanic?

1:14:49.323 --> 1:14:51.783
I'm not sorry
I attacked your friend.

1:14:52.784 --> 1:14:55.662
I don't know why you're angry with me.
I have been open with you

1:14:55.913 --> 1:14:59.082
and you keep sending in
this asshole

1:14:59.291 --> 1:15:00.334
to hurt me.

1:15:02.419 --> 1:15:03.754
Talk to me, Oualid.

1:15:04.338 --> 1:15:05.756
Why are you upset?

1:15:06.048 --> 1:15:09.384
When I... I am the one
who has the right to be upset

1:15:09.468 --> 1:15:10.511
cos you...

1:15:12.012 --> 1:15:13.972
cos you killed Luke.

1:15:45.128 --> 1:15:46.880
Why did you move us now,
Oualid?

1:15:47.256 --> 1:15:48.340
What changed?

1:15:49.591 --> 1:15:50.551
You lied to me.

1:15:52.094 --> 1:15:53.178
You and the soldier.

1:15:54.054 --> 1:15:55.973
All these numbers, useless!

1:15:58.767 --> 1:16:00.394
Why are the codes useless?

1:16:01.144 --> 1:16:02.729
Were you listening to Luke?

1:16:02.813 --> 1:16:04.731
That guy was delirious.

1:16:06.358 --> 1:16:08.193
He had a 105-degree fever

1:16:08.277 --> 1:16:11.280
because you tortured him
and wouldn't give him a doctor!

1:16:15.158 --> 1:16:16.577
You do things...

1:16:18.245 --> 1:16:19.454
to make me hurt you.

1:16:22.374 --> 1:16:23.834
You like to be hurt.

1:16:25.878 --> 1:16:27.171
Deep down...

1:16:29.339 --> 1:16:30.507
you think...

1:16:32.092 --> 1:16:33.343
you deserve it.

1:16:33.844 --> 1:16:34.845
No.

1:16:45.230 --> 1:16:46.273
I like it...

1:16:46.398 --> 1:16:47.983
I like it when you stop.

1:16:48.483 --> 1:16:50.068
How do you know I will stop?

1:16:50.986 --> 1:16:51.987
Hm?

1:16:53.363 --> 1:16:54.531
You don't anymore.

1:16:54.823 --> 1:16:57.826
I didn't stop with the soldier.
I might not stop with you.

1:16:59.453 --> 1:17:01.079
You want to get in my head.

1:17:01.872 --> 1:17:04.750
You want to get in my head so badly.

1:17:17.721 --> 1:17:19.181
A man hurt you

1:17:20.891 --> 1:17:22.476
when you were in high school.

1:17:24.394 --> 1:17:25.854
What did he do to you?

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:31.360
Tell me.

1:17:38.075 --> 1:17:39.159
I was...

1:17:41.245 --> 1:17:43.121
I was at a high school party.

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:46.291
I didn't have any friends.

1:17:46.375 --> 1:17:48.502
The American kids didn't like me,
I was...

1:17:49.419 --> 1:17:51.713
raised in Bahrain,
for Christ's sake.

1:17:51.797 --> 1:17:54.383
I didn't know how to dress
or be cool.

1:17:55.092 --> 1:17:56.134
He was...

1:17:56.677 --> 1:18:00.222
He was a football player,
like Luke.

1:18:02.307 --> 1:18:03.517
He seemed to like me.

1:18:05.310 --> 1:18:06.478
I needed that.

1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:09.106
Keep going.

1:18:11.149 --> 1:18:13.527
We walked to my house.

1:18:15.654 --> 1:18:16.780
He got weird.

1:18:18.282 --> 1:18:20.242
I asked him,
I asked him to leave.

1:18:22.411 --> 1:18:23.579
He didn't.

1:18:25.497 --> 1:18:26.582
And...

1:18:27.457 --> 1:18:28.458
And then...

1:18:32.421 --> 1:18:33.505
I don't know.

1:18:37.885 --> 1:18:39.928
I don't know why it happened to me.

1:18:54.151 --> 1:18:56.153
You chose to invite him
into your home.

1:18:58.488 --> 1:18:59.698
You're responsible.

1:19:00.866 --> 1:19:01.825
No.

1:19:02.284 --> 1:19:04.411
If you believe you are a victim

1:19:05.037 --> 1:19:06.455
then you're powerless.

1:19:07.664 --> 1:19:08.957
You felt helpless.

1:19:09.666 --> 1:19:11.126
You wanted to feel powerful.

1:19:11.251 --> 1:19:13.462
So you worked hard,
you joined the CIA

1:19:13.670 --> 1:19:15.339
and now you're in my cell.

1:19:16.048 --> 1:19:18.008
Because of what a boy
did to you in high school.

1:19:22.471 --> 1:19:25.140
The problem is, Oualid

1:19:27.601 --> 1:19:29.269
you're a crazy person.

1:19:35.359 --> 1:19:38.737
You got that bomb
dropped on your house.

1:19:39.613 --> 1:19:41.490
The one that killed your daughter.

1:19:43.659 --> 1:19:45.077
You're responsible.

1:19:51.375 --> 1:19:52.501
Ah.

1:19:54.503 --> 1:19:55.838
Look at you.

1:19:57.798 --> 1:19:59.967
When we first met,
I gave you a quarter of that pain

1:20:00.050 --> 1:20:01.343
and you couldn't take it.

1:20:02.386 --> 1:20:03.762
Now it's nothing to you.

1:20:11.186 --> 1:20:12.646
The entry code.

1:20:13.605 --> 1:20:16.191
To gain access
to the embassy security doors.

1:20:18.402 --> 1:20:19.778
The real code.

1:20:22.072 --> 1:20:22.990
Tell me.

1:20:28.245 --> 1:20:29.580
Will that kill me?

1:20:30.831 --> 1:20:31.874
Yes.

1:20:35.669 --> 1:20:36.712
OK.

1:20:38.797 --> 1:20:40.883
I am choosing this.

1:20:44.803 --> 1:20:47.264
Five-three-seven...

1:20:48.807 --> 1:20:50.058
three...

1:20:50.726 --> 1:20:51.768
nine...

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:54.646
nine.

1:20:58.400 --> 1:20:59.943
You're mine, Khadija.

1:21:04.198 --> 1:21:05.282
Forever.

1:22:15.394 --> 1:22:17.312
Abu Khalid!

1:22:18.230 --> 1:22:19.523
Khalid!

1:22:24.236 --> 1:22:25.571
Abu Khalid!

1:22:30.450 --> 1:22:31.785
OK, OK.

1:22:43.422 --> 1:22:45.424
Come on, come on, come on...

1:22:48.719 --> 1:22:49.803
Oh, my God...

1:22:50.012 --> 1:22:52.389
US Embassy Baghdad,
how may I direct your call?

1:22:52.472 --> 1:22:54.683
I need the Directorate
of Intelligence, Chief of Station.

1:22:54.766 --> 1:22:55.934
This is an emergency.

1:22:56.393 --> 1:22:57.436
Please hold.

1:23:00.147 --> 1:23:02.065
Come on, come on, come on.

1:23:03.233 --> 1:23:05.194
US Consulate. How may I assist you?

1:23:05.277 --> 1:23:07.529
Um, this is an officer in distress,
my name is Khadija Young

1:23:07.613 --> 1:23:09.198
my NCS Officer number is 83072.

1:23:09.281 --> 1:23:10.699
I'm being held hostage in a basement

1:23:10.782 --> 1:23:12.826
in Mosul, 30 feet south
of the Great Mosque of al-Nouri.

1:23:12.910 --> 1:23:15.996
My captor is high-value target,
Abu Khalid.

1:23:16.413 --> 1:23:18.624
OK, um,
I'm gonna have to transfer you.

1:23:18.749 --> 1:23:20.584
No, no, no! Do not put me on hold!

1:23:20.751 --> 1:23:22.252
Shit.

1:23:24.296 --> 1:23:25.631
Hello, how may I help you?

1:23:25.714 --> 1:23:28.675
This is Kat Young, NCS number 83072.

1:23:28.759 --> 1:23:31.220
I'm being held in a cell in Mosul
near the Great Mosque...

1:23:31.303 --> 1:23:33.096
Can you hold while I confirm
your ID number?

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:35.432
No! No, no, no!
I'm an officer in distress.

1:23:35.599 --> 1:23:37.392
They will kill me any minute.

1:23:37.476 --> 1:23:39.853
This is Kat Young, you know that
I was kidnapped on Al Saddiq Road

1:23:39.937 --> 1:23:41.813
- in Mosul.
- Where did you say you're located?

1:23:41.897 --> 1:23:44.900
Thirty feet south of the Great Mosque
of al-Nouri.

1:23:45.526 --> 1:23:47.736
How many captors?

1:23:48.487 --> 1:23:49.738
Uh, um...

1:23:49.863 --> 1:23:51.782
Three to five. Including Abu Khalid.

1:23:53.033 --> 1:23:55.869
OK, I'm gonna relay this
to the COS evac team.

1:23:55.953 --> 1:23:57.704
I have stolen a cell phone.

1:23:57.788 --> 1:24:00.499
I am going to die any minute
and they will move location.

1:24:00.582 --> 1:24:03.460
Alright, I get it. Can I still confirm
your NCS ID number?

1:24:03.544 --> 1:24:04.920
Oh, God fucking dammit!

1:24:07.214 --> 1:24:08.090
Hello?

12 years ago in Damascus

1:24:20.143 --> 1:24:21.728
and formed the Ummah Brotherhood.

Samir Kassab

1:24:24.773 --> 1:24:25.899

Saif Shadid is an arms buyer...

1:24:30.779 --> 1:24:32.406
- Shut up!
- ...living in Khartoum.

1:24:32.531 --> 1:24:34.366

- Amir Halabi recruits fighters

1:24:34.449 --> 1:24:35.409
in Baghdad!

1:24:36.994 --> 1:24:39.872
You're funded by a Saudi
oil family named Fhad.

1:24:40.038 --> 1:24:43.000

1:24:50.674 --> 1:24:53.302
I know your whole network, Oualid.

1:24:53.969 --> 1:24:55.429
I know everything about you.

1:24:58.891 --> 1:25:00.392
What are you up to?

1:25:30.839 --> 1:25:31.840
Baghdad...

1:25:32.174 --> 1:25:34.593
I've ID'd your entire cell.

1:25:34.927 --> 1:25:37.763
You wanted to get in my head,
I got in yours.

1:26:03.664 --> 1:26:05.332
Does your army
have a ground team in Mosul?

1:26:05.415 --> 1:26:07.334
We have a special task force
and it's coming.

1:26:08.293 --> 1:26:09.378
Oualid.

1:26:09.586 --> 1:26:12.130
Look at me very carefully.

1:26:13.423 --> 1:26:14.758
I'm not lying to you.

1:26:21.306 --> 1:26:23.183
You know what I see
when I look at you?

1:26:24.184 --> 1:26:25.352
Fear.

1:26:54.339 --> 1:26:57.384
US Marines!
Drop your weapons!

1:26:57.551 --> 1:26:58.886
Drop your weapons!

1:26:59.219 --> 1:27:01.221
Get on the ground!
On the ground!

1:27:01.430 --> 1:27:03.098
Here she is!

1:27:30.292 --> 1:27:31.418
Miss Young!

1:27:32.753 --> 1:27:34.087
She's in here!

1:27:36.715 --> 1:27:37.841
Miss Young?

1:27:41.178 --> 1:27:42.221
Miss?

1:27:44.348 --> 1:27:45.516
Miss Young...

1:27:47.518 --> 1:27:50.896
I need to ask you a few questions
to confirm your identity.

1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:52.523
Do you understand me?

1:27:53.607 --> 1:27:54.816
What is your name?

1:27:55.192 --> 1:27:56.401

- Mm.

1:27:59.321 --> 1:28:00.948
What were you doing in Mosul?

1:28:01.990 --> 1:28:03.325
Intelligence.

1:28:07.871 --> 1:28:08.914
Can you move?

1:28:09.790 --> 1:28:10.958
Is anything broken?

1:28:17.923 --> 1:28:19.049
We need a stretcher.

1:28:19.383 --> 1:28:21.426
Miss Young,
is there a Marine with you?

1:28:21.510 --> 1:28:22.636
Lucas White?

1:28:29.017 --> 1:28:32.062
We've been looking for you.
Round-the-clock patrols for weeks.

1:28:32.312 --> 1:28:33.355
It's good to see you.

1:28:33.438 --> 1:28:35.232
We're gonna get you out of here,
Miss Young.

1:28:39.027 --> 1:28:39.903
I'm sorry, Miss?

1:28:42.406 --> 1:28:43.740
What's that, Miss Young?

1:28:43.949 --> 1:28:45.701
