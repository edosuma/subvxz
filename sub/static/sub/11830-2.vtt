This isn't lawyering, Susan.
I promise.

35:28.673 --> 35:31.209
Uh-huh.

35:31.276 --> 35:34.446
Now, on Roberts, when
you try for six years
instead of 12,

35:34.513 --> 35:38.484
that is lawyering,
isn't it?
That is not fair.

35:40.819 --> 35:43.922
I'm just lookin'
for a point of reference
here, Bobby.

35:43.989 --> 35:46.359
When you tell me
that I shouldn't let
this kid be charged,

35:46.425 --> 35:49.362
are you saying that with
the same conviction you bring
to the Roberts case?

35:49.428 --> 35:51.898
This isn't right.
And you know it.

35:51.965 --> 35:55.001
It's a tough world.
I gotta go walk upstairs
to my superiors...

35:55.068 --> 35:57.937
and tell them that I let
a juvie killer go scot,

35:58.004 --> 36:01.641
and settle for six for
an armed robber who put a gun
up to a senior citizen's temple.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.743
That's one
for you, one for me.
Take your pick.

36:03.810 --> 36:09.349
This is completely unethical.
[ Sighs ]
You're right.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.518
And I withdraw the offer.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.021
And I'm dealing
with one case at a time.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.990
Roberts is first.

[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

- <i>Now you're tellin' me 10?</i>
- Ten is good, Lyle.

36:29.705 --> 36:32.140
It's the best
that I can do.
Yesterday, six was good.

36:32.207 --> 36:34.075
Listen to me.
Judge White is tough.

36:34.142 --> 36:36.812
There's a possibility
you could get life.
I don't think that will happen.

36:36.878 --> 36:39.014
But what if he just
slaps you with 20?
What then?

36:39.080 --> 36:40.916
Maybe I should roll
the dice and go to trial.

36:40.982 --> 36:43.185
You're not gonna
beat the rap on this.

36:43.252 --> 36:45.822
Would every lawyer
tell me that?

36:45.888 --> 36:50.092
[ Door Creaks, Slams ]
Maybe not before
they got your retainer.

36:50.159 --> 36:54.897
<i>Look, Lyle, as I said,</i>
<i>you want to fire me, fine.</i>
<i>I won't be losing sleep.</i>

36:54.964 --> 36:57.033
But 10 is good.

36:57.099 --> 37:00.903
One of the reasons
we're getting 10 is because
I got a dialogue with the D.A.

37:00.971 --> 37:03.340
You want to play craps?

37:03.406 --> 37:05.508
It's your choice.

37:05.575 --> 37:08.779
But I think that--

37:08.846 --> 37:11.549
I think that
you should take the deal.

37:14.418 --> 37:17.821
Okay.
You take it.

37:17.888 --> 37:20.091
But this sucks!

I know.

37:26.464 --> 37:28.633
[ Buzzer ]

37:46.051 --> 37:48.821
He'll take it.
Ten years.

37:48.888 --> 37:50.756
Good.

Let's turn to our next case.

37:56.629 --> 38:00.800
Michael, the little boy.

38:00.867 --> 38:05.371
I talked to the officers,
read the reports.

38:05.438 --> 38:08.008
I'm concluding
it's self-defense.

38:09.776 --> 38:11.745
Good.

38:25.960 --> 38:30.432
Oh, the psychologist wants
to see you both again
in the morning.

38:30.498 --> 38:32.700
Okay.

38:34.202 --> 38:36.138
Thank you.

38:36.204 --> 38:40.008
I don't know how
we're gonna get through
this, but thank you.

38:40.075 --> 38:43.946
As long as Michael's
not going to jail.
No, he isn't.

38:44.012 --> 38:45.948
Hey, Mike?

38:46.014 --> 38:48.451
This is gonna hurt
for a long, long time.

38:48.517 --> 38:53.989
So, uh, you don't have to be
this brave Robin Hood or--
or any kind of hero.

38:54.057 --> 38:56.659
You just got to talk
to the doctors.

38:58.661 --> 39:00.697
I've got to take care
of my mother.

39:04.768 --> 39:08.838

Uh, y-you go ahead.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.763
I got some business here.

39:41.006 --> 39:42.941
Thank you.

39:44.743 --> 39:47.679
I lied to my client.
You didn't lie.

39:47.746 --> 39:51.283
You told him 10 years
was a good deal. It is.

39:51.350 --> 39:54.120
So it's--
It's coincidental.

39:56.088 --> 39:59.158
Roberts wouldn't
have done better.

39:59.225 --> 40:02.294
And this kid gets a chance.
We both know that.

Yeah.

What's the problem?

40:33.461 --> 40:36.665
People at the bank are asking
questions about the loan
we extended to you.

Somebody from Boston Fidelity
called inquiring about
our office expansion?

how he wasn't responsible.

Ronald Martin,
the man who strangled
Donna Braun for seven minutes.

40:57.820 --> 41:02.024
Then your motion is denied.
Mr. Pearson, you may
resume the deposition.

You'll pay the court costs
for this hearing,

- and I'm fining you
$500 to boot.
- What?
