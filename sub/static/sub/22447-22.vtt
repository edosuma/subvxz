10:46.290 --> 10:48.790
Should've taken a little longer
to get over me.

10:48.790 --> 10:51.710
(laughs)
If it's any consolation,

10:51.710 --> 10:54.080
I never would have.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.080
Cyrus, either.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.250
(sighs)
I am so sorry I left
without saying goodbye.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.080
But you're back.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.830
That's all that matters.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.620
I kinda don't wanna open
Time Capsule Buffy anymore.

11:10.710 --> 11:13.170
Now that I know
what's inside her.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.420
You mean... it?

11:15.420 --> 11:18.170
No, I don't.

11:18.170 --> 11:21.830
Well-- Why am I texting Jonah
to come over now?

11:21.830 --> 11:24.380
Duh, to give him the bracelet.

11:24.380 --> 11:28.710
Well, that's my real reason,
but what's my text reason?

11:28.710 --> 11:31.000
Enough.
I'll text him.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.120
What are you gonna say?

11:33.120 --> 11:36.170
That I'm back
and I wanna see him.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.670
You're not even gonna
mention me at all?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.500
-(text chimes)
-Ooh--

11:42.500 --> 11:45.120
(laughing)
I already sent it!
It's gone!

11:47.420 --> 11:49.620
If you could stop refreshing
your email every five seconds,

11:49.620 --> 11:51.460
I'd find that
really refreshing.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.290
The coach said he'd send out
the team roster at 4 o'clock.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.540
It's 4 o'clock!

11:56.540 --> 11:58.040
It's 3:58.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.170
You still have two minutes.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.210
I'm not going
to make the team.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.830
You're gonna make the team.

12:03.830 --> 12:06.000
Don't worry about my feelings.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
Be honest with me.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.620
How'd I look at tryouts?

12:10.710 --> 12:13.170
-Honestly?
-Please.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.040
You played with
commitment and heart,

12:15.040 --> 12:17.500
and I'm sure that that's
what they're looking for.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.790
(phone chimes)

12:18.790 --> 12:20.170
Is that the coach?

12:22.080 --> 12:23.790
It's a text from Buffy.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.750
She says she's back.

12:25.750 --> 12:26.920
Is she back?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.080
Did I not mention that?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.790
No, dude, you didn't.

12:29.790 --> 12:33.000
-(phone pings)
-Buffy again?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.040
It's the coach.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.080
This is gonna be
more good news.
We're on a roll!

12:41.830 --> 12:44.040
No, no, no, no.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.460
There must've been
some mistake.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.960
(sighs)

12:47.960 --> 12:50.170
That coach is a fool
and a buffoon.

12:50.170 --> 12:54.330
This is a senseless decision
and he will rue the day
he made it.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.380
-It's okay.
-This is not okay!

12:56.380 --> 12:59.000
This is the furthest thing
from okay.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.620
It gives me a goal.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.040
Something to work towards.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.040
Well, if that's how you feel,
then I will stop shouting.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.580
Thanks for being there.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.080
I'm lucky to have you
as a friend.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.330
We're both lucky.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.080
Hey, you know what'll
make you feel happy?

13:16.080 --> 13:18.500
-Seeing Buffy.
-Let's go!

13:18.500 --> 13:20.580
Hey, can I borrow your vest?

13:20.580 --> 13:22.210
For what?

13:22.210 --> 13:25.790
If I'm the elite team's
"vest friend," I'll get
to know them,

13:25.790 --> 13:28.080
learn the plays,
and they'll see
how committed I am.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.500
Solid plan, man.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.380
However, I will
need to educate you
on the various pockets,

13:32.380 --> 13:35.420
and the proper distributions
of the products therein.

13:35.420 --> 13:38.040
Maybe I'll just
get my own vest.

13:42.330 --> 13:47.000
Um, I understand
that you are responsible
for this little lady.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.080
I hear you can't get it open.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.250
Want me to give it a shot?

13:50.250 --> 13:53.290
Actually, Andi told me
what was inside.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.580
I decided I don't
wanna take it apart.

13:55.580 --> 13:58.170
The whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.290
-What he said.
-(all laughing)

14:00.290 --> 14:02.790
Okay, well, if you
change your mind,

14:02.790 --> 14:05.290
here are the instructions.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.620
Ahh, it came
with instructions.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.790
(laughs)

14:10.790 --> 14:12.580
Oh, can you guys
stick around?

14:12.580 --> 14:17.580
Bex is getting snacks,
and Andi has something
she'd like to tell Jonah.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.830
Did you really have to?

14:20.830 --> 14:22.540
(quietly)
You clearly weren't going to.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.620
Hmm...

14:24.620 --> 14:28.170
I-- Yeah-- Outside?

14:28.170 --> 14:29.460
Sure.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.120
What's up?

14:50.500 --> 14:53.420
Well, um--
(clears throat)

14:53.420 --> 14:58.620
It turns out...
that... (sighs)

15:00.880 --> 15:02.880
I thought
you threw it away.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.250
I thought so, too.

15:07.420 --> 15:08.380
(sighs)

15:12.290 --> 15:14.290
I'm so glad you're smiling
right now.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.210
-It's deja vu all over again.
-(laughs)

15:24.040 --> 15:28.880
You said
this was a girlfriend-y,
boyfriend-y thing.

15:31.670 --> 15:34.790
Do you still think that?

15:34.790 --> 15:36.000
Yes.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.540
Do you?

15:41.790 --> 15:42.830
Yeah.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.460
I'm so happy for them.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.830
But for real this time.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.460
It's okay if you're not.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.250
But I am.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.330
That's great.

15:59.330 --> 16:02.040
If you ever feel like
talking about it, though--

16:02.040 --> 16:05.080
Buffy, my crush on Jonah...

16:05.080 --> 16:07.290
-Yeah?
-It's gone.

16:07.290 --> 16:09.880
Really?
When did that happen?

16:09.880 --> 16:12.250
I can't say exactly
when it ended.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.460
Today is when I realized it.

16:14.460 --> 16:17.790
Jonah tried out
for an elite Ultimate team,
and he didn't make it.

16:17.790 --> 16:20.040
Which he probably
wouldn't want you to know.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.960
It could not be
more irrelevant.

16:21.960 --> 16:25.330
Great.
Anyway, he felt bad,
so we hugged,

16:25.330 --> 16:29.330
which used to make my heart
go, like, ba-boom ba-boom
ba-boom ba-boom.

16:29.330 --> 16:35.330
But this time, it was more,
(slower) ba-boom, ba-boom,
ba-boom, ba-boom.

16:35.420 --> 16:39.380
So, your crush,
it just disappeared.

16:39.380 --> 16:43.460
I wouldn't say disappeared,
more like, just, changed.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.460
To friendship.

16:45.460 --> 16:48.170
It was my first crush,
I don't know how they work.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.620
And you couldn't tell me,
'cause you've never
had one, either.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.080
I haven't?

16:54.170 --> 16:55.420
What are you saying?

16:55.420 --> 16:57.710
Nothing.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.250
Have you had a crush?

17:01.250 --> 17:04.250
I haven't had... a crush.

17:06.210 --> 17:07.670
You have one?

17:08.790 --> 17:12.620
As I live and breathe,
Buffy Driscoll has a crush!

17:12.620 --> 17:14.500
It's brand new.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.790
It just happened.

17:15.790 --> 17:19.380
This is so exciting.
Tell me everything,
starting with who!

17:19.380 --> 17:20.580
Oooh!
I can't wait.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.380
Ready? Go!

17:22.380 --> 17:24.540
Sorry, didn't mean
to interrupt.

17:24.540 --> 17:27.210
Ha-ha!
I've got snacks.

17:27.210 --> 17:28.880
Sweet and salty!

17:30.830 --> 17:34.290
Huh. Who doesn't like
chocolate-covered pretzels?

17:36.500 --> 17:39.000
♪ ♪

17:39.000 --> 17:40.170
-Okay.
-Whoo!

17:40.170 --> 17:42.460
-There we go...
-Ham: It's strong mixing!

17:42.460 --> 17:46.040
(both laughing)

17:46.040 --> 17:47.420
You go, girl.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.710
Whoa, wow.

17:48.710 --> 17:52.580
♪ Oh, good times ♪

17:52.580 --> 17:56.290
♪ We got good, good times ♪

17:56.290 --> 17:59.000
Andi: Oh, look, these are
almost too pretty to eat.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.620
-Mm.
-Almost.

18:01.620 --> 18:05.170
Mm, these are the best
I've ever made.

18:05.170 --> 18:06.710
Ahem?

18:06.710 --> 18:07.830
We made.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.620
-Mm-mm.
-And it wasn't that hard.

18:10.620 --> 18:13.080
-It was super easy.
-It was fun.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.460
Well, if you want them
again soon,

18:15.460 --> 18:16.670
you're gonna have to do them
without me,

18:16.670 --> 18:18.120
because I won't be here.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.830
What do you mean
you won't be here?

18:19.830 --> 18:22.500
I'm gonna do a little traveling.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.540
Just for a few weeks.
Maybe longer.

18:25.540 --> 18:28.210
Mom can't leave.
We're about
to open the store.

18:28.210 --> 18:30.080
I'm going alone.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.420
Go where?

18:31.420 --> 18:34.540
Ah, first, I'm going
to this ashram in India.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.000
What's that?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.080
It's a spiritual retreat
where you go to find
inner peace.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.500
But you are
the most peaceful person
in the family.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.620
-(Ham laughs)
-You said "first."

18:45.620 --> 18:47.120
What are you doing after?

18:47.120 --> 18:48.790
No idea.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.500
It'll be an adventure.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.460
But what about us?

18:53.460 --> 18:54.580
You'll be fine.

18:54.580 --> 18:57.120
You don't know that.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.290
What if I need you?

18:58.290 --> 19:01.620
Ohh, everybody's
in a good place here.

19:01.620 --> 19:04.170
You're busy with
friends and school,

19:04.170 --> 19:06.210
and Bex and Celia
have Cloud Ten.

19:06.210 --> 19:08.960
This is a great time
for me to go.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.880
But I never even knew
you wanted to go.

19:12.880 --> 19:17.580
Why all of a sudden
are you this ashram guy
who wants to have adventures?

19:19.080 --> 19:20.750
I thought you were Pops.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.670
Oh, I'm still Pops, Shnoo.

19:23.670 --> 19:25.620
And this isn't a new idea.

19:25.620 --> 19:28.540
CeCe and I have dreamed
for years of selling
the house one day

19:28.540 --> 19:30.500
so that we could travel.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.500
But when that day came...
we didn't.

19:34.580 --> 19:35.880
For me.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.920
And then Celia's dream changed
and she bought a business.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.380
For me.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.580
I'm glad.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.710
It-- It all worked out
for the best.

19:43.710 --> 19:45.790
It's just, my dream
hasn't changed.

19:45.790 --> 19:48.620
This is something
I have to do.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.830
For me.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.120
Okay?

19:53.120 --> 19:54.250
Okay.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.000
What does Mom think
of all this?

19:57.170 --> 20:00.040
-Well...
-You haven't told her yet?

20:00.040 --> 20:01.830
I was going to at dinner.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.460
Ohhh...

20:04.540 --> 20:06.380
We're gonna need
more dumplings.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.250
When's he gonna tell her?

20:11.250 --> 20:13.540
He'll wait till after dinner.
He has to.

20:15.120 --> 20:19.620
Where! Are! My! Dumplings!

20:19.620 --> 20:21.380
(laughs)

20:21.380 --> 20:22.670
Here they come!

20:22.670 --> 20:24.290
(gasp)

20:24.290 --> 20:26.170
Ho leng.

20:31.620 --> 20:32.920
What are you waiting for?

20:32.920 --> 20:34.290
Come on!

20:34.290 --> 20:36.170
Nothing! Ha!

20:37.710 --> 20:40.380
Before we eat these dumplings,

20:40.380 --> 20:42.670
there's somethin' I need
to tell you.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.670
What's happening?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.580
Ryan Dilmore.

20:58.580 --> 20:59.710
Nope.

20:59.710 --> 21:00.540
Lucas Sarno.

21:00.540 --> 21:01.620
Nope.

21:01.620 --> 21:02.750
Dave Schnepper?

21:02.750 --> 21:04.540
The Schnep?

21:04.540 --> 21:07.000
Are you kidding?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.880
This isn't fair.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.920
I told you my crush,
and you know how difficult
that was.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.580
This is different.

21:14.580 --> 21:16.290
How is it different?

21:17.750 --> 21:19.250
I don't know.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.120
It just is.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.710
Anyways, it doesn't matter,
because nothing is going
to happen.

21:24.710 --> 21:28.210
It still matters.
It's your first crush.

21:28.210 --> 21:31.710
And we're crush buddies.
We only tell each other.
we don't tell anyone else.

21:31.710 --> 21:33.380
Not even Andi.

21:35.290 --> 21:36.880
Ooh.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.540
I can't tell Andi?

21:38.540 --> 21:39.790
Why can't I tell Andi?

21:39.790 --> 21:41.540
I've said too much already.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.540
Because it's him?

21:57.500 --> 21:58.790
Andi:
Next, on Andi Mack...

21:58.790 --> 22:00.790
-Aahh!
-Aaah! What are you doing here?

22:00.790 --> 22:03.580
Sorry, the bulb's usually on
if my mom's with a patient.

22:03.580 --> 22:06.000
-Of course you'd be here.
-Of course you'd be here.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.620
Jonah, allow me to explain--

22:08.620 --> 22:10.790
I think it's pretty obvious
what's goin' on here.

22:10.790 --> 22:11.710
Morgan, let me
show you something.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.620
Each one of these
plays a different song.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.960
-I like it.
-Can you put away
the music boxes?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.580
-All done.
-Is that all of the boxes?

22:17.580 --> 22:18.620
Yes.

22:18.620 --> 22:19.790
-You have a tell.
-A what?

22:19.790 --> 22:22.040
A tell.
It's an unconscious
thing you do

22:22.040 --> 22:23.330
when you're trying
to hide something.

22:23.330 --> 22:25.040
Like who you have a crush on?

22:25.040 --> 22:26.080
-(two drumbeats)

22:26.080 --> 22:27.080
-(boing)
-(thud)
