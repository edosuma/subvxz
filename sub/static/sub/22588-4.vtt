<i>In the last bat episode, we saw</i>
<i> a grand opening.</i>

00:14.480 --> 00:19.550
<i> With a big come-on.</i>
<i> Then pandemonium.</i>

00:21.387 --> 00:23.588
<i> The tell-tale umbrella.</i>

00:23.590 --> 00:27.091
<i> The mark of that</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:29.660
<i> The bat call was made.</i>

00:29.662 --> 00:32.930
<i> Batman leapt into the fray..</i>

00:32.932 --> 00:35.800
<i> ...against the Penguin..</i>

00:35.802 --> 00:39.136
<i> ...and his</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:42.340

00:42.342 --> 00:45.109

00:45.111 --> 00:47.111

<i> ...with a clue attached.</i>

00:59.592 --> 01:02.827
<i> Baffling to the dynamic duo.</i>

01:02.829 --> 01:06.364
<i> They decided to bug</i>
<i> the tricky bird.</i>

01:06.366 --> 01:08.532
<i> The bug was planted.</i>

01:08.534 --> 01:11.002
<i> And the Penguin was bugged.</i>

01:11.004 --> 01:14.038
<i> Batman was trapped.</i>

01:14.040 --> 01:16.440
<i> And ready for the barbeque.</i>

01:17.744 --> 01:21.612

Something's fishy, Alfred.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.765
No signal from the super-power
radio transmitter

03:19.767 --> 03:21.466
built into that spider?

03:21.468 --> 03:24.503
Not even a carrier wave.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.805
It might be due to sunspots,
Master Robin.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.342
I believe they can inhibit even
the most powerful radio waves.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.746
Does seem rum, however.

03:34.748 --> 03:38.016
I do hope Mr. Bruce
hasn't fallen into some..

03:38.018 --> 03:39.084
...hot spot.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.000
Drat! That heat
is waking him up.

03:55.002 --> 03:58.003
He won't throw no good.
We hooked that net real tight.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.471
Yeah, it's like steel.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.441
It's like a real
golden eagle net.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.443
Who is that guy, anyway?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.711
That's what I'd like to know.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.214
I've seen him someplace before.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.538
Has he flipped?

04:33.540 --> 04:35.073
That guy needs
a cigarette lighter

04:35.075 --> 04:36.875
like a moose
needs a hat rack.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.910
You fool! That's the kind
I use myself.

04:38.912 --> 04:42.581
It's filled with
a lifetime supply of butane gas

04:42.583 --> 04:44.316
compressed inside.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.818
If he managed to toss
that into the furnace..

05:02.302 --> 05:04.736
Don't worry, boss,
we'll get him.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.605
Wait a minute.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.340
- Let him go.
- What?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.542
He'll go running
to the cops, Penguin.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.044
How can he, you birdbrains?

05:13.046 --> 05:16.348
He's a crook himself.
Remember?

05:16.350 --> 05:19.885
- He was trying to bug my shop.
- Say, yeah, that's right.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.555
The main thing is he won't
come nosing around here anymore.

05:23.557 --> 05:27.092
Besides I need both of you here,
my fine feathered finks.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.094
The time is almost nigh.

05:30.531 --> 05:34.065
At the signal, the time
will be precisely 5:20.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.405
Forty minutes to go.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.275
At precisely 6 o'clock
the built-in timer

05:43.277 --> 05:45.777
will send the bat-brella
into action.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.286
'Exactly two minutes to 6.'

05:54.288 --> 05:55.921
'I'll give Bruce
two minutes more'

05:55.923 --> 05:57.222
then I'll call the commissioner.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.490
Very wise, Master Robin.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.958
Doubtless the police
will inaugurate

05:59.960 --> 06:01.426
a most effective search.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.495
Hot diggity!

06:03.497 --> 06:04.963
Here he comes now!

06:10.237 --> 06:13.071
- What happened, Batman?
- Penguin almost outfoxed me.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.105
Good heavens, sir

06:14.107 --> 06:15.674
you look as if you've been

06:15.676 --> 06:17.242
in some sort of nasty snare.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.777
Oh, it was nothing, Alfred.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.313
You might go up
and tend to my clothes, though.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.582
They're in rather rocky shape.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.016
Very good, sir.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.824
The point is our scheme to bug
the Penguin's lair won't work.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.594
We'll have to solve the mystery
of the bat-brella ourselves.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.330
Right! Let's muster
all of our brain power.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.009
The stroke of 6.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.044
Let's see how
my gimmick is working.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.993
'Gosh, Batman,
this is sure a tough one.'

07:07.995 --> 07:10.295
Jumping Jiminy's!
It's the Boy Wonder.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.397
It's my most dazzling stroke.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.132
A secret radio transmitter

07:14.134 --> 07:18.303
built into the handle
of the bat-brella.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.372
'I wonder if these colors
mean anything?'

07:20.374 --> 07:24.142
Colors are certainly striking.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.212
Could it be the Penguin's way
of taunting us with a clue

07:27.214 --> 07:28.747
to where he's going to strike?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.849
Hey, you've got something.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.719
This green could
stand for money. Or emeralds.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.921
Or is it all the colors
taken together?

07:36.923 --> 07:39.658
You mean,
like a collection of gems?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.926
The jeweled meteorite
on display at the museum.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.995
Wow!

07:43.997 --> 07:46.064
'Studded with emeralds,
and diamonds, and rubies.'

07:46.066 --> 07:48.199
'The Penguin's
favorite bird seed.'

07:48.201 --> 07:50.201
Could he get at it, though?

07:50.203 --> 07:52.437
We'll check the plans
of the museum.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.839
What did I predict!

07:54.841 --> 07:58.710
Batman has picked our crime,
next he'll tell us how to do it.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.178
You're a real genius.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.212
Shh-h-h.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.349
Gotham City Museum.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.084
Third floor plan.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.957
- Impossible.
- Burglar proof.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.294
Not even the Penguin could get
through those security devices.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.363
Scratch the jeweled meteorite.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.799
Back to the bat-brella.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.735
Curses! That sounded
like a sweet caper.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.871
Fear not, dear finks,
I know Batman's fertile mind.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.373
He'll come up with another.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.312
I still think the clue
must be in the colors.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.582
They're so pretty.
It's like a beautiful dawn.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.251
- Beautiful dawn.
- Huh?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.421
Dawn Robbins,
the beautiful movie star.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.423
She's on location
here in Gotham City.

08:45.425 --> 08:48.560
Holy popcorn! Could he be
planning to kidnap her?

08:48.562 --> 08:50.662
Dawn Robbins in a picture
called "The Mockingbird"

08:50.664 --> 08:52.564
produced by Ward Eagle.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.266
And she's staying in the
penthouse at the Pelican Arms.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.801
Birds in every bush.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.337
A penguin ploy,
if I've ever heard one.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.340
It'd cost Eagle countless
thousands a day if she's gone.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.443
'Quick, let's figure out how
the Penguin plans to pull it.'

09:05.445 --> 09:07.946
Hawkeye, get out your notebook.

09:12.185 --> 09:16.488
Pelican Arms Hotel.
Upper stories, general view.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.758
- 'Look, it's a perfect setup.'
- 'How, Batman?'

09:19.760 --> 09:22.861
The penguin operates from
this roof across the street.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.997
He shoots a line
to Dawn's penthouse terrace..

09:25.999 --> 09:29.033
'...then slides down the line
on one of his tricky umbrellas.'

09:29.035 --> 09:31.536
'Gosh, yes! He's got all
that equipment readymade'

09:31.538 --> 09:33.638
'in his criminals' storeroom.'

09:37.477 --> 09:39.844
'It's a fiendish,
well-laid scheme.'

09:39.846 --> 09:41.880
- 'Only we're onto it.'
- 'Right.'

09:41.882 --> 09:43.948
'What'll we do?
Tip off Commissioner Gordon?'

09:43.950 --> 09:45.383
'No, not on your life.'

09:45.385 --> 09:48.119
The Penguin and I
have a score to settle.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.822
We'll put the salt
on his tail ourselves.

10:05.972 --> 10:09.507
To the Pelican Arms,
my fine feathered finks.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.876
We're gonna hatch the Batman

10:11.878 --> 10:13.878
a certain surprise.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.737
'Charming, Ms. Robbins.
Delightful.'

10:38.739 --> 10:41.040
'Just the thing
for Funboy magazine.'

10:41.042 --> 10:44.276
Now if you could just
curl up a trifle more, hmm?

10:44.278 --> 10:46.145
Oh.

10:46.147 --> 10:51.150
What a drag it is being
a famous movie star and so rich.

10:51.152 --> 10:53.485
Why doesn't anything exciting
ever happen to me?

10:53.487 --> 10:55.554
Ah, well, one never knows

10:55.556 --> 10:58.057
what lurks around life's corner,
Ms. Robbins.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.965
Here we are, right under
Dawn Robbins penthouse terrace.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.801
'Gosh, Batman, it's high.'

11:08.803 --> 11:10.602
'Pretty tough throw
for the bat-a-ring, huh?'

11:10.604 --> 11:13.338
Good point.
Better use the bat-zooka.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.748
Aha.

11:22.750 --> 11:26.285
It's just like
Batman's blueprint.

11:26.287 --> 11:28.454
'There's Robbin's nest
across the way.'

11:28.456 --> 11:29.922
Let's get to work.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.125
Ready with the bat-zooka.

11:36.197 --> 11:37.763
What was that?

11:37.765 --> 11:39.531
Sounded like a bat-zooka.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.866
The dynamic duo.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.435
They just fired
the famous bat-rope.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.003
Bull's eye.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.473
The hook caught the railing
of the terrace.

11:47.475 --> 11:50.142
Yeah, the game's going
exactly as I planned.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.610
Let's get to work.

12:04.959 --> 12:06.992
Thanks, Wilbur.
Get those prints to Mr. Eagle.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.494
He'll be expecting them.

12:09.964 --> 12:12.397
I going up.
The air, it's stuffy in here.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.133
Wait, I'll get you a wrap.

12:14.135 --> 12:18.203
If you catch a cold, it'll cost
Mr. Eagle countless thousands.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.671
Oh.

12:19.673 --> 12:22.808
What a boring
humdrum life this is.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.211
I'm not even a person,
I'm merely a commodity.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.680
Like soap. It's like..

12:30.584 --> 12:31.717
Eek!

12:31.719 --> 12:33.418
Oh, help.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.420
There's guys from outer space.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.092
Don't be alarmed, Ms. Robbins.
We're not law breakers.

12:40.094 --> 12:42.194
'We're here
to protect you, ma'am.'

12:42.196 --> 12:43.729
Great Scott.

12:43.731 --> 12:45.731
The Caped Crusader
and the Boy Wonder.

12:47.768 --> 12:48.834
Who?

12:48.836 --> 12:50.402
Being a stranger to Gotham City

12:50.404 --> 12:52.004
of course, you wouldn't know.

12:52.006 --> 12:55.541
Batman and Robin.
Ace crime fighters.

12:55.543 --> 12:58.777
Oh, gee-whiz.
Batman, you're kinda cute.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.245
Could you use
some publicity?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.614
I'm sorry, Ms. Robbins.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.283
Forget it.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.685
Batman never lends himself
to commercial enterprises.

13:06.687 --> 13:09.188
We're here to foil
a daring crime.

13:09.190 --> 13:11.890
A plot to kidnap
Dawn Robbins.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.626
- What?
- Me?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.361
- Her?
- 'No time to explain.'

13:16.363 --> 13:18.397
Now just do as I say. Listen.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.733
Uh-huh.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.203
- All set, you birds?
- All set, Penguin.

13:24.205 --> 13:27.105
Alright, let's show
that my Penguin line

13:27.107 --> 13:30.642
is a match for that bat-rope.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.377
Catapult..

13:32.379 --> 13:34.246
...shoot.

13:48.529 --> 13:49.995
Perfect, let's go.

13:53.234 --> 13:55.667
Who says penguins can't fly?

14:24.131 --> 14:26.131
Give me that. Yes.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.970
Plug in the Penguin magnet

14:31.972 --> 14:34.039
and wait till
I give you the signal.

14:48.122 --> 14:49.621
Surrender, you foul bird.

14:49.623 --> 14:52.124
It's back to the pen
for you, Penguin.

14:52.126 --> 14:53.692
Well..

14:53.694 --> 14:57.229
So this is the end of my
fiendish, well-laid plan, is it?

15:00.401 --> 15:03.535
Oh, holy loadstone.

15:03.537 --> 15:04.903
What's happening?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.204
We're in the grip of--

15:06.206 --> 15:08.740
My Penguin magnet.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.310
It's irresistibly drawing
the metal objects

15:11.312 --> 15:14.179
in your utility belt.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.214
Oh, he's right, Batman.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.216
It's stronger than we are.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.860
Well, look at both of you.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.696
The dynamic duo.

15:30.698 --> 15:35.267
Their faces completely
covered with Penguin ink.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.868
Start the winch.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.403
What'll we do now, Batman?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.872
If we could just
get our utility belts off.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.751
Holy flypaper,
what a fix.

15:57.725 --> 16:00.425
<i> Victory for the tricky birds?</i>

16:00.427 --> 16:03.862
<i> The dynamic duo's</i>
<i> darkest hour.</i>

16:03.864 --> 16:06.231
<i> Dawn...gone.</i>

16:08.836 --> 16:11.303
<i> One dawn gone..</i>

16:11.305 --> 16:13.605
<i> ...but then another comes.</i>

16:17.244 --> 16:19.277
So this was the clue
which allowed you

16:19.279 --> 16:20.812
to anticipate
the Penguin's crime, huh?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.382
- A fat lot of good it did.
- Enough, Mr. Jay.

16:23.384 --> 16:25.417
Who could possibly have foreseen
the Penguins appointment

16:25.419 --> 16:26.752
of a gigantic magnet?

16:26.754 --> 16:28.954
He's right, commissioner.
We failed.

16:28.956 --> 16:30.255
And how?

16:30.257 --> 16:32.290
If that waiter hadn't
come in at midnight

16:32.292 --> 16:33.825
we might still be
stuck there.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.395
'I say pay the ransom.'

16:36.397 --> 16:39.331
'I say nothing matter's
but Dawn's safety.'

16:39.333 --> 16:41.733
'And Mr. Eagle's
shooting schedule.'

16:41.735 --> 16:43.635
'I agree with Mr. Jay.'

16:43.637 --> 16:46.571
'We're the first private plane.
Do you have the money?'

16:46.573 --> 16:48.807
'Right here,
in this suitcase, Batman.'

16:48.809 --> 16:50.108
'Two hundred thousand dollars'

16:50.110 --> 16:52.778
'in unmarked bills
of small denominations.'

16:52.780 --> 16:54.913
'Chief O'Hara,
give us a summary'

16:54.915 --> 16:56.982
of the Penguin's ransom
instructions once again.

16:56.984 --> 16:58.283
Well, it's a trade, sir.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.085
You see,
the dough for Ms. Robbins.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.988
'He'll pick the suitcase and
leave the girl in its place.'

17:02.990 --> 17:04.423
'Unharmed, says he.'

17:04.425 --> 17:06.791
But for the effect
of a mild anesthetic.

17:06.794 --> 17:08.326
Mm-hmm. When and where?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.795
A neutral spot.

17:09.797 --> 17:11.997
He suggests the front hall
of Wayne Manor.

17:11.999 --> 17:14.366
As Commissioner Douglas knows

17:14.367 --> 17:16.968
that's the beautiful home
of Bruce Wayne the millionaire.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.871
Mr. Wayne and I are close.
I've dined there often.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.973
The time is to be 10
this morning.

17:21.974 --> 17:25.109
If we agree, we're to
fly a red gas balloon

17:25.112 --> 17:26.645
'from the statue
of George Washington'

17:26.646 --> 17:28.046
'in Gotham Square.'

17:29.283 --> 17:30.615
What do you think, Batman?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.150
We have no choice.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.219
- I buy it.
- Yes, yes, gladly.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.021
Alright, Chief,
you arrange for the balloon.

17:36.023 --> 17:37.823
I'll call Bruce
and speak to him.

17:37.825 --> 17:39.558
Begging your pardon, sir

17:39.560 --> 17:42.127
but I've taken the liberty
of doing that myself already.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.663
Uh, what did Mr. Wayne say?

17:44.665 --> 17:46.798
It was the butler
I spoke with.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.000
Mr. Wayne and his ward
are away fishing.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.635
Good.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.405
Let's deliver the ransom
money ourselves, Batman.

17:53.407 --> 17:54.706
Right, Robin.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.808
We'll do even better.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.711
I seem to remember a picture
in the Gotham City Times.

17:59.713 --> 18:01.880
Some society affair.

18:01.882 --> 18:03.682
Inside the front hall
of Wayne Manor

18:03.684 --> 18:05.684
'aren't there two suits
of ancient armor?'

18:05.686 --> 18:07.219
- 'Yes, of course.'
- 'I get it.'

18:07.221 --> 18:08.753
'We'll hide inside the armor.'

18:08.755 --> 18:10.822
'Soon as the girl is safe,
we pounce.'

18:10.824 --> 18:12.991
Right again, Robin.

18:12.993 --> 18:16.161
The last trick
of this tricky hand is ours.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.373
<i> Will the Penguin and his finks</i>
<i> have the last laugh?</i>

18:55.335 --> 18:56.701
Yes, sir, what can I--

20:08.008 --> 20:10.609
Sleep tight,
my little ones.

20:10.611 --> 20:12.043
By the time you awake

20:12.045 --> 20:14.179
in 18 hours

20:14.181 --> 20:17.482
I'll be safe
in my hideaway in Alaska.

20:23.757 --> 20:26.157
Who was that
at the door, Alfred?

20:26.159 --> 20:28.159
If it's the cleaning man..

20:31.431 --> 20:33.131
Oh!

20:33.133 --> 20:35.367
Alfred.

20:35.369 --> 20:36.501
Oh!

20:40.007 --> 20:42.073
Close the door.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.475
We'll divide the loot

20:43.477 --> 20:45.543
and we'll fly
our separate ways.

20:47.648 --> 20:49.180
Wrong, Penguin.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.583
You'll all fly together.

20:51.585 --> 20:54.386
Up the river, you birds
of a filthy feather.

20:54.388 --> 20:56.254
You betrayed yourself
at the penthouse.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.591
'You used the very same words
I'd spoken in the bat-cave.'

20:59.593 --> 21:02.894
We found out about your
secret radio transmitter.

21:02.896 --> 21:05.030
We acted out a charade
to trap you.

21:05.032 --> 21:06.665
B-b-but the gas..

21:06.667 --> 21:08.833
I put you to sleep
in the armor.

21:08.835 --> 21:09.934
I saw it.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.037
- A trap.
- Dummies in that armor.

21:12.039 --> 21:13.905
We were here all the time.

21:13.907 --> 21:16.508
Alright, boys, our umbrellas.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.764
Saints alive.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.833
No, Chief O'Hara,
not "Saints alive"

22:14.835 --> 22:17.335
four birds bagged.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.838
Tell Warden Crichton,
they keep better on ice.

22:33.254 --> 22:34.954
Oh, come on, Aunt Harriet.

22:34.956 --> 22:37.022
Just one more
hors d'oeuvres, huh?

22:37.024 --> 22:39.492
After all that shrimp salads

22:39.494 --> 22:41.026
no, indeed, Dick Grayson.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.829
I'm not going to see you
have nightmares.

22:43.831 --> 22:46.499
It's bad enough
that our peaceful home

22:46.501 --> 22:49.502
was involved in
a wicked crime last week.

22:50.772 --> 22:54.006
My, oh, my,
if you'd seen what I saw.

22:55.476 --> 22:58.144
You see Dick and I
were off fishing.

22:58.146 --> 23:00.679
You really know as much
about it as I do.

23:00.681 --> 23:02.214
You've read it in the papers.

23:02.216 --> 23:04.283
Perhaps you'd like to
wander over there

23:04.285 --> 23:06.152
and ask Commissioner Gordon.

23:06.154 --> 23:11.791
The origin of the Batcostume,
ladies and gentleman, is simple.

23:11.793 --> 23:14.627
As Batman realized when
he set out on his crusade

23:14.629 --> 23:17.530
nothing so strikes terror
into the criminal mind

23:17.532 --> 23:20.533
as the shape and shadow
of a huge bat.

23:29.677 --> 23:32.311
Ah, Ms. Robbins.
Mr. Jay.

23:32.313 --> 23:34.580
I'm so delighted
you could come.

23:34.582 --> 23:36.415
Our host, Ms. Robbins.

23:36.417 --> 23:37.883
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

23:37.885 --> 23:41.720
Head of the famous philanthropic
Wayne foundation.

23:41.722 --> 23:43.189
You don't say.

23:49.096 --> 23:53.065
Gosh, what's the matter
with that gorgeous girl?

23:53.067 --> 23:55.568
Her manner did seem
a trifle odd.

23:55.570 --> 23:58.204
The lingering effects of
that criminals gas, perhaps?

23:58.206 --> 23:59.738
No, Mr. Wayne.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.441
It's more tragic than that.
Much more tragic.

24:02.443 --> 24:04.743
'She only glimpsed him
for a moment.'

24:04.745 --> 24:06.745
'And she's hopelessly
in love with him.'

24:08.149 --> 24:11.684
Her unknown savior...Batman.
