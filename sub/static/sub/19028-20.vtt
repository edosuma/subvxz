WEBVTT

00:00.324 --> 00:02.761
<i>Now that Elliot had
accepted Keith's proposal,</i>

00:02.762 --> 00:04.469
it was time to start planning the wedding.

00:04.662 --> 00:07.364
Ok, so I took a picture of the church
that we're gonna be married in.

00:07.963 --> 00:09.624
Only imagine that the horse upfront

00:09.625 --> 00:12.246
is actually a horse and a carriage,
and the people in the coffins are us.

00:12.718 --> 00:16.806
- You... already picked the church?
- Yeah, I reserved it for the third week in July,

00:16.807 --> 00:18.549
every year since I was nineteen.

00:18.550 --> 00:21.049
When I'll tell Father O'Neil that
I actually need it this time,

00:21.050 --> 00:23.359
he's going to crap the communion cracker.

00:23.630 --> 00:26.148
Now, being that it's already
May, we have to decide

00:26.149 --> 00:28.682
if we wanna get married in two
months, or in a year and two months.

00:29.133 --> 00:32.430
<i>Women tend to hear one thing,
when men offer them wedding advices.</i>

00:32.785 --> 00:34.187
<i>So when Keith said this:</i>

00:34.339 --> 00:37.463
Elliot, two months isn't enough time
to plan a wedding.

00:37.768 --> 00:39.338
<i>Elliot heard this:</i>

00:40.622 --> 00:44.372
Go ahead, do whatever you
want, regardless of what I say.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.067
Great! Two months it is!

00:53.773 --> 00:55.604
God, I can't stop thinking about Elliot.

00:56.009 --> 00:58.746
Dude! It's over, ok?
You guys had your chance.

00:58.965 --> 01:00.960
She crushed you.
You crushed her.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.361
It's always a train wreck.

01:02.850 --> 01:04.792
- That was then!
- What's so different now?

01:04.793 --> 01:06.177
She's getting married.

01:07.343 --> 01:10.056
I don't know. I guess in the
back of my head I thought

01:10.094 --> 01:14.014
even after all the hell we put each other
through, we might end up together, you know?

01:15.095 --> 01:15.771
Yeah.

01:16.328 --> 01:19.554
I mean... what if not being with Elliot
is the biggest mistake of my life?

01:20.280 --> 01:21.851
You made bigger mistakes.

01:23.679 --> 01:27.441
For tickets to see "Basic Istinct 2",
press the paddle key.

01:29.976 --> 01:31.766
That one still stinks.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.844
Yeah, she didn't even show her vajayjay.

01:34.181 --> 01:37.019
Oh, it's on the DVD extras.
It's labelled "Vagina".

01:37.570 --> 01:40.529
Look, hey, I'm ging to Phoenix
this weekend, for a surgical conference.

01:40.530 --> 01:42.907
Why don't you come with me?
It'll probably take your mind off Elliot.

01:43.421 --> 01:45.785
I don't know Turk.
Will I get my own room?

01:46.245 --> 01:49.055
- We'll have to share.
- Then you know what my answer is.

01:49.745 --> 01:54.488
On our way to Phoenix, yeah!

01:55.676 --> 01:58.757
Hey, you know how in the movies
when a car get further and further away

01:58.758 --> 02:01.758
you can still hear people talking like
they're right in front of the camera?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.379
Yeah, that drives me crazy.

02:05.649 --> 02:07.406
Hey! I want snacks for the trip.

02:07.811 --> 02:10.743
Pringle? Oh, uhm, turn left here
to go on the freeway.

02:12.135 --> 02:14.189
No, not yet. I gotta stop and go pee.

02:14.972 --> 02:17.202
Already? I told you to go before we left.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.862 --> 02:35.941
Right time to hit the convention floor.

02:35.942 --> 02:38.100
- You got your name tag?
- Yes, I do.

02:39.464 --> 02:40.815
Me too.

02:42.223 --> 02:44.072
It's full of extra security around here.

02:44.679 --> 02:47.017
Every year, the same group
of rowdy doctors,

02:47.018 --> 02:51.043
arrive and all they do is drink,
hit on women and trash the place.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.274
Oh, God.

02:53.603 --> 02:54.589
Here they are now.

03:01.246 --> 03:02.918
Wassup, Phoenix!

03:02.919 --> 03:05.566
Ohh, that's what I like about this town.

03:05.922 --> 03:10.101
Hey there... Patrick!
Good to see you again, man.

03:11.088 --> 03:12.084
Fetch!

03:13.872 --> 03:16.304
Oh, Bob, would you hit that, huh?

03:16.821 --> 03:20.313
What are you stoned? I wouldn't hit
that with Stottlemeyer's dong.

03:20.314 --> 03:21.938
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

03:21.976 --> 03:23.178
Out of my way, boys.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.568
Me and my fellow chiefs of medicine
are gonna tear this bitch up.

03:29.469 --> 03:31.807
One of those dudes is gonna
die this weekend.

03:32.773 --> 03:35.872
- Come on. Let's go get you mind off Elliot.
- It's not that easy, T---

03:36.869 --> 03:41.037
- Oh, my God. Is that who I think it is?
- Yep. Old MC.

03:41.498 --> 03:43.198
I was saving it as a surprise.

03:43.199 --> 03:46.221
He's only the best Young MC
impersonator on the circuit.

03:46.222 --> 03:47.405
The man's a genius.

03:47.406 --> 03:48.778
Let's get him to say:
"Bust a move!"

03:49.031 --> 03:51.792
Dude, the guy spends year
after year on a convention circuit

03:51.793 --> 03:53.332
saying that line, I'm pretty sure

03:53.333 --> 03:55.388
- he's sick and tired to say it.
- You probably right.

03:55.549 --> 03:56.611
"Bust a move, man!"

03:57.953 --> 03:59.315
Hey, "Bust a move!"

04:00.864 --> 04:02.798
- Bust a move, fellas!
- Aaah!

04:02.875 --> 04:06.171
You bust a move! Old Young MC!

04:06.172 --> 04:07.908
- Check me!
- Bust a move!

04:07.909 --> 04:09.852
You're the one who should be busting moves!

04:10.115 --> 04:11.045
I can die now.

04:12.297 --> 04:15.057
<i>Elliot was wasting no time spreading
the word about her wedding.</i>

04:15.058 --> 04:16.607
July 21st, save the date.

04:16.608 --> 04:18.456
July 21st, save the date.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.776
Oh, July 21st, save the date.

04:21.744 --> 04:22.762
How is it going?

04:24.448 --> 04:26.965
Ok, as your maid of honour,
I have to say that

04:26.966 --> 04:30.129
2 months is not enough time
to plan a wedding!

04:31.330 --> 04:33.302
Wait. I just realized.

04:33.884 --> 04:36.157
You haven't even asked me
to be your maid of honour yet.

04:36.739 --> 04:39.114
Oh my God, Carla, I've been too busy.
I've just assumed you knew that you were.

04:40.119 --> 04:41.331
Ah, Carla?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.378
Will you be my maid of honour?

04:44.561 --> 04:46.673
Of course I will! You are my best friend!

04:46.795 --> 04:50.429
Ah! Yeah! Ahahahah!

04:50.693 --> 04:53.322
But seriously, do you realize how much work
goes into planning a wedding?

04:53.434 --> 04:56.430
Ah, yeah! What do you think
I've been doing for the last ten years?

04:57.078 --> 04:58.965
See, it's all in here.

04:59.894 --> 05:01.584
Ah! There's the seating charts.

05:02.092 --> 05:04.852
And the photographer that I reserved
every year under different alias.

05:04.853 --> 05:05.551
Mmh!

05:05.583 --> 05:07.808
Oh, and here is a photo of my wedding dress.

05:07.809 --> 05:10.083
Which I'm totally going to fit into, thanks

05:10.084 --> 05:12.271
to that awesome parasite
I got from eating sushi.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.549
Oh. Hey, everyone!

05:14.122 --> 05:16.150
I've been looking for
a new role playing game,

05:16.151 --> 05:19.578
ever since my "Lord of the Rings" club
booted me for using an actual warhammer.

05:19.878 --> 05:22.094
So, would anybody mind, if I pretended

05:22.283 --> 05:24.161
to be the chief of medicine,
while Kelso is out of town?

05:24.442 --> 05:26.282
Ah! Janitor you're a natural!

05:27.653 --> 05:28.583
Fantastic!

05:28.865 --> 05:31.090
Let's make cancer feel foolish.

05:34.123 --> 05:34.977
Uh!

05:35.315 --> 05:36.940
Save the date.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.372
Oh, gosh! July 21...

05:41.570 --> 05:43.701
It's a... it's a bit of a problem.

05:44.846 --> 05:45.609
Why?

05:46.161 --> 05:48.621
Because I wouldn't go to your wedding

05:48.622 --> 05:50.762
if it was held in my very own backyard.

05:52.340 --> 05:54.180
Hey! Can I bring a date?

05:55.190 --> 05:57.528
Oh, what am I thinking?
I'll meet someone there!

06:05.669 --> 06:08.702
And what the hell have you two
been doing all morning?

06:08.964 --> 06:11.180
- You know...
- Meeting...

06:11.264 --> 06:13.198
- Hip-hop girls...
- Greeting, we got these...

06:14.334 --> 06:15.649
He gave some hip-hop hugs.

06:17.273 --> 06:20.634
Say I was too nervous to hand that girl
over there, what advice would you give me?

06:21.067 --> 06:23.010
- Bust a move!
- Ahah!

06:23.273 --> 06:25.611
Alright, alright.
What if a great song comes on,

06:25.818 --> 06:28.090
but I'm too shy to get down?
What should I do?

06:28.579 --> 06:29.743
Bust a move!

06:30.514 --> 06:32.861
You're awesome man!
What are you drinking? We'll buy you one.

06:33.444 --> 06:34.280
Bust a move!

06:37.838 --> 06:39.847
- You know, convention stuff.
- You know, convention stuff.

06:40.430 --> 06:43.897
Look. Just because I get to spend the weekend

06:43.898 --> 06:47.378
drinking beer with the guys and overpaying
the escorts so they'll do the weird stuff,

06:47.379 --> 06:49.613
doesn't mean you two get to screw around!

06:50.411 --> 06:52.805
Attend some lectures! Visit some booths!

06:52.984 --> 06:54.965
Act like professionals, damn it!

06:55.444 --> 06:56.984
Sir, we are being professional.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.031
Yeah! We, we were coming over here...

06:59.379 --> 07:01.980
just now to check out this booth
right here with the crapper!

07:02.309 --> 07:04.563
Oh, wait, it's, it's much more than that.

07:04.986 --> 07:06.808
If a patient has a bowel movement in it,

07:06.911 --> 07:09.070
it immediately gives the diagnosis.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.343
We call it, the Dr. Toilet!

07:14.310 --> 07:18.732
Mr. Mimov, I wanted a second opinion,
so I've called in my colleague Dr. Toilet.

07:20.301 --> 07:22.989
I agree.
The best course of action is dialysis.

07:23.822 --> 07:26.875
Dr. Toilet, I'm sorry about the other day, uhm...

07:26.977 --> 07:30.367
I've just had my morning coffee
and a bran muffin, it was...

07:30.987 --> 07:35.090
kind of an emergency situation, I know
you were napping, but it was an accident.

07:35.184 --> 07:39.128
An accident? Dr. Dorian, there are
48 other toilets in this hospital.

07:39.607 --> 07:42.621
I'm the only one that's a doctor,
and then you came into my office

07:42.959 --> 07:44.320
and you sat on me.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.372
Didn't you hear me screaming to get off?

07:48.395 --> 07:50.846
Roger, in my defence those
sounds were very muffled.

07:50.847 --> 07:52.555
I thought they were coming from me!

07:53.673 --> 07:56.668
You know what, John?
Let's just drop it and move on.

07:58.621 --> 08:01.861
Janine, hold my calls. I'm gonna take a nap.

08:02.180 --> 08:03.401
Sure thing, Dr. Toilet.

08:19.306 --> 08:21.005
I wouldn't be able to help myself.

08:23.221 --> 08:26.695
Hi, Gary, it's Elliot Reid. I know
that we haven't spoken since

08:26.696 --> 08:29.297
you broke up with me in the 11th grade
but I just wanted to let you know

08:29.298 --> 08:32.854
that I'm getting married. Oh, also I was
sorry to hear that you lost your legs.

08:34.083 --> 08:37.313
I'm notifying all my old boyfriends today
that I'm officially off the market.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.769
I'm sure the "pulse" setting on your
shower head will be devastated.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.605
Look, blondie,

08:42.253 --> 08:46.687
I've a cardiac patient who needs a perfusion
imaging and since your fancy private practice

08:46.688 --> 08:49.539
has one of those spect cameras, I was
hoping just rather use it.

08:50.309 --> 08:54.009
Sure. Just as long as you promise to come
to my wedding the cameras are all yours.

08:55.276 --> 08:56.393
Why do you even care?

08:56.900 --> 08:59.107
I know that we don't exactly
like each other but...

08:59.764 --> 09:03.041
over the past 6 years you've become
a huge part of my life so...

09:03.745 --> 09:04.684
I would love you to come.

09:05.896 --> 09:10.074
Plus if you don't than table 14
would be boy girl boy girl girl

09:10.281 --> 09:11.220
and that's insanity.

09:11.915 --> 09:13.624
Jennifer next to Jennifer next to Najah...

09:13.746 --> 09:17.849
Plus there's Bobby, put him next to her.
But at the end Bobby doesn't get along with Jennifer.

09:17.923 --> 09:20.295
Yeah, camera no camera, please

09:20.296 --> 09:24.092
consider this me checking the
"will not be attending" column:

09:25.694 --> 09:26.323
Aah!

09:28.727 --> 09:31.158
Sorry, Carla but i need you
to take care of this lab work.

09:31.159 --> 09:35.064
Keith, I'm already covering three floors.
Can you believe this, Ted?

09:36.154 --> 09:38.773
Aaah...h when..

09:39.431 --> 09:43.431
people try to put me in the middle
of things my troath closes.

09:44.426 --> 09:46.332
Listen here,  young doctor Gilchrist

09:46.473 --> 09:48.323
Uh, that's not my name.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.627
Gilchrist? Please.

09:50.124 --> 09:52.406
She's not upset with you
because you asked her to help.

09:52.416 --> 09:55.900
She's upset you insinuated
her job was less important.

09:56.454 --> 09:57.515
He's actually right.

09:58.210 --> 09:59.834
And you, nurse Ipanema.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.839
Realize this is a young doctor under stress.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.750
Ted, come along. We've much work to do.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.872
Wait Ted, Ted, Ted? What are you doing?

10:10.164 --> 10:11.262
I'm a follower.

10:25.234 --> 10:26.905
Ok, when the lecture starts,

10:27.224 --> 10:30.698
I'll start to choke and then you yell:
"Is there a doctor in the house?"

10:30.980 --> 10:33.110
That's a good kill. Just be
careful, don't really choke,

10:33.111 --> 10:34.332
- That wouldn't be funny.
- No.

10:36.893 --> 10:39.382
Do you think if Elliot and I were still
dating we'd be getting married?

10:39.719 --> 10:42.236
Dude, you gotta turn this off,
allright? We are on vacation,

10:42.237 --> 10:43.917
there are plenty of hot girls here.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.841
And single.

10:46.489 --> 10:47.222
Turk,

10:47.841 --> 10:49.982
Elliot getting married is a big deal for me.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.743
It's not just one girl who's gonna
make me stop thinking about it.

10:53.006 --> 10:55.494
Good afternoon.

10:56.264 --> 11:00.180
I'm doctor Briggs, and I'm lecturing
on the use of high dose radiation therapy

11:00.397 --> 11:01.533
in prostate cancer.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.411
<i>Except maybe the last girl I was in love with.</i>

11:07.204 --> 11:10.030
To be honest with you, I can't make
Hedger tales out of these things.

11:10.031 --> 11:13.265
When is this hospital gonna
get a tuned spect camera?

11:13.266 --> 11:16.213
That is a very good point and I am on it, Ted?

11:16.729 --> 11:17.959
Add that to the list.

11:18.081 --> 11:21.950
I will check to see if the quaterly fiscals
can accomodate the financial comps.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.330
I hope so.

11:24.944 --> 11:25.451
Ted,

11:26.296 --> 11:28.522
you do realize that was all jibberish. He's...

11:28.523 --> 11:30.102
he's just pretending.

11:30.103 --> 11:32.806
He can't make any real changes in this place.

11:34.233 --> 11:36.327
Tell that to the new daycare program.

11:38.036 --> 11:38.665
Hi, dad.

11:39.116 --> 11:39.792
Jack?

11:40.966 --> 11:42.544
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

11:43.351 --> 11:45.276
- Oh, who's this?
- I don't know. Get out.

11:47.389 --> 11:48.431
Hmmm...

11:49.286 --> 11:51.718
You know, if you are still having problems
with that picture,

11:51.719 --> 11:54.845
all you gotta do is agree to go to my
wedding, and you can use our camera.

11:55.314 --> 11:59.934
Blondie, as attached as
I have indeed become to my patient,

11:59.935 --> 12:03.530
his death due to my inability
to see a clear picture of his heart

12:03.531 --> 12:05.906
would still be a preferable alternative

12:06.169 --> 12:09.408
to actually having to hear you
utter your self-written vows:

12:09.409 --> 12:11.455
"My dearest Keith,

12:11.746 --> 12:17.524
my heart was like a vault but you
picked the lock like an apple thief

12:17.571 --> 12:21.374
who picks the first golden
delicious of the fall harvest".

12:21.625 --> 12:23.822
Ok, first of all stop reading my
wedding binder.

12:24.291 --> 12:24.976
It's private.

12:25.765 --> 12:26.309
And...

12:27.314 --> 12:31.305
I cannot believe that you wouldn't wanna
come see me start my life with my soulmate.

12:31.595 --> 12:33.689
Soulmate? Try 'last resort'.

12:33.690 --> 12:36.186
Let's just be honest for two seconds here.

12:36.187 --> 12:38.753
You basically lived in this dump
for the last six years

12:38.754 --> 12:41.914
and there weren't that many guys
to choose from once you eliminate

12:41.915 --> 12:44.394
the women and the gays,

12:46.056 --> 12:47.315
the too old,

12:48.488 --> 12:49.803
the too poor,

12:50.469 --> 12:53.981
the ones who just barely beat the rap
for murdering their first wife,

12:54.460 --> 12:56.281
and of course, Ted.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.981
Noooooo!

13:00.929 --> 13:01.849
Well then...

13:02.929 --> 13:04.018
What's left?

13:09.691 --> 13:10.789
As you can see here,

13:10.790 --> 13:14.808
recurrents rates were significantly
diminished with the higher doses.

13:15.014 --> 13:17.540
I can't believe Kim's here, I guess I
have to go talk to her.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.155
And why is that a bad thing?

13:19.259 --> 13:21.183
Uh, we've never spoken since the miscarriage.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.062
She looks good. I think her
boobs got bigger.

13:25.550 --> 13:27.766
Really? Let me see.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.202
Yeah, you're right. Check it!

13:35.503 --> 13:37.935
<i>As we sat there air-grooping my ex,</i>

13:38.356 --> 13:40.450
<i>I wondered how things were
going back at the hospital.</i>

13:45.746 --> 13:48.384
<i>Elliott was probably still giddy
about her engagement.</i>

13:49.098 --> 13:50.892
So let me ask you this there, Barb.

13:51.569 --> 13:54.047
Do you really wanna marry Keith?

13:54.835 --> 13:56.713
Or do you just want to get married?

14:00.009 --> 14:03.652
Uh, ok. That's... that's all I've got.
Thanks for barely listening.

14:06.394 --> 14:07.962
Do you think she still thinks about me?

14:10.207 --> 14:11.230
Probably.

14:12.611 --> 14:14.020
Are there any questions?

14:25.654 --> 14:28.800
Why would you tell me you miscarried our
child when you clearly didn't?

14:31.626 --> 14:34.720
That's probably a question I should
answer more face-to-face

14:34.721 --> 14:38.630
after the lecture, are there...
any... other... questions?

14:39.381 --> 14:40.611
Yes, you sir.

14:41.606 --> 14:44.048
Yeah, uhm... I think you should
answer his question.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.075
<i>How did he get over ther so fast?</i>

14:46.573 --> 14:48.901
- You're a good friend!
- I've got your back.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.456
Anyone else have a question? Yes,
you... i-in the back.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.071
Bust-a-move!

14:57.503 --> 15:00.075
Really more of a statement than
a question, but thank you.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.405
I've always wanted to be married so badly,

15:04.602 --> 15:06.583
but what if I am settling with Keith?

15:06.978 --> 15:09.781
Elliott, what you're going through is normal.

15:09.782 --> 15:13.570
Hmm hmm, when I got engaged
all I could think of was...

15:13.617 --> 15:17.110
"Why am I with this angry, cinical idiot?"

15:17.420 --> 15:21.222
But then I fought through it and
realized he was the love of my life.

15:21.658 --> 15:24.485
Unfortunately we had a little argument,
and so we broke up,

15:24.739 --> 15:27.872
but then late I met Perry a month
later, we have 2 beautiful children

15:27.873 --> 15:31.188
and the point is: sometimes settling works.

15:32.024 --> 15:32.587
Oh.

15:35.032 --> 15:36.328
And that is how I got my name.

15:36.713 --> 15:37.812
You don't look Asian.

15:38.215 --> 15:41.126
Hey, why aren't you being the
chief of medicine?

15:41.662 --> 15:43.850
I'm just taking a break, Ted, I
don't want it to get stale.

15:44.234 --> 15:48.272
The hospital needs you! I need you!
Doesn't that mean anything?

15:50.234 --> 15:51.191
Damn right it does.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.464
Now let's go find a cure for polio.

15:58.798 --> 15:59.578
Sorry...

16:00.939 --> 16:03.503
Ah... ok, too soon for laughter,

16:04.638 --> 16:06.526
I know that you must be really upset.

16:06.629 --> 16:10.225
Upset is just one of the emotions I'm
feeling, Kim. How could you do this to me?

16:10.638 --> 16:13.718
I don't know. My hormons went crazy!

16:13.886 --> 16:17.181
And I was scared and I thought that we were
only together because I was pregnant.

16:17.182 --> 16:19.651
and so, I lied and I pushed you out the door

16:19.652 --> 16:22.365
and then I got really angry that you left me.

16:24.189 --> 16:25.861
Were you ever planning on telling me?

16:26.133 --> 16:29.213
Yes, of course. Yes. I just
hadn't figured out how yet.

16:29.514 --> 16:31.383
I mean, what can I possibly say?

16:31.542 --> 16:35.439
I don't know. How about: "JD, I think there
might be something living in my uterus".

16:37.590 --> 16:39.336
I know I made a huge mistake.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.365
And I'm so so sorry.

16:41.366 --> 16:44.679
I did just hide back myself under this corner
and I didn't know how to get out and...

16:47.036 --> 16:47.843
You know what?

16:49.533 --> 16:51.073
No more excuses.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.463
I did a horrible thing.

16:58.614 --> 17:00.116
I don't expect you to forgive me.

17:01.252 --> 17:02.961
Ok, because I'm not going to.

17:06.121 --> 17:08.999
You probably hate me right now
because I hate myself...

17:11.910 --> 17:13.590
But it was really good seeing you and...

17:15.065 --> 17:16.819
and I thought I can do this on my own,

17:17.487 --> 17:18.276
but I can't.

17:20.529 --> 17:22.782
I'm alone and I'm terrified,

17:23.656 --> 17:25.806
and I have no right to ask you for this,

17:26.810 --> 17:28.868
but I could really use some help.

17:33.694 --> 17:36.173
Crap salad, I gotta go give another lecture.

17:36.896 --> 17:38.774
I just need forty minutes and...

17:41.421 --> 17:45.083
please stay. Promise me that you'll
just stay, and we can talk about this.

17:46.248 --> 17:46.802
Fine.

17:47.843 --> 17:49.158
But I'm not doing it for you.

17:50.116 --> 17:50.820
Fair enough.

17:57.985 --> 18:01.919
There's no need to freak out, Elliot. All women
go through the same stages once they are engaged.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.364
First there's the: "Yeah, I'm engaged" stage.
Do you remember yesterday?

18:05.881 --> 18:08.717
I know. It was so great.

18:09.271 --> 18:13.048
Then comes the: "Oh, my God I can't believe
I'm gonna have sex with the same person

18:13.049 --> 18:17.458
for the rest of my life" stage, and that's
when you head to the nearest frat house,

18:17.459 --> 18:20.669
ditch your undies and then the next morning
do the walk of shame to your beemer.

18:21.813 --> 18:22.406
Sure.

18:23.485 --> 18:24.237
Elliot,

18:24.734 --> 18:28.781
You'll get throgh this. You just have
to try to not act like a crazy person, see.

18:29.278 --> 18:31.644
At times like this we tend to torture a man.

18:31.917 --> 18:32.865
To test him.

18:33.494 --> 18:35.701
Oh, yeah. I can't see myself doing that.

18:36.697 --> 18:38.265
What's this, Keith? Huh?

18:39.157 --> 18:41.054
Our sample invite
with the letter you picked up.

18:41.055 --> 18:44.670
Uh, no. This is not, what I picked up.
I picked up Flourished Italic,

18:44.671 --> 18:47.599
now you go back to the printer,
and tell them it should look like this.

18:54.051 --> 18:57.816
I went to calligraphy camp. Now don't you screw
this up Keith.  Because if this goes wrong,

18:57.817 --> 19:00.389
then the wedding goes wrong,
and then I'll get depressed, and fat,

19:00.390 --> 19:02.476
and you cheat on me and I swear to God

19:02.477 --> 19:04.025
I will CHOP IT OFF!

19:06.571 --> 19:07.416
What just happened?

19:09.509 --> 19:12.842
I suppose this will
dissolve surgical glue but...

19:13.575 --> 19:15.096
may I ask how that happened in the first place?

19:15.819 --> 19:18.100
Oh, you know, boys being boys.

19:20.044 --> 19:21.547
A spect camera, eh?

19:21.913 --> 19:23.876
My hospital Sacred Heart
needs one of those.

19:24.805 --> 19:26.044
It's funny you should say that.

19:26.204 --> 19:28.983
I was just on the phone with
your chief of medicine ten minutes ago.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.044
Hm. Tax this to someone.

19:39.969 --> 19:41.265
Chief o'medicine.

19:41.368 --> 19:44.589
I'm the Chief of medicine, Bob Kelso.
Who the hell is this?

19:45.210 --> 19:46.693
Uh, I'm you.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.548
I'm talking to you from a future phone.

19:49.735 --> 19:51.622
By the way sell all your gasoline stocks,

19:51.811 --> 19:53.745
everything now runs on potatoes!

19:53.746 --> 19:56.168
I don't know who the hell
this is but when I find out

19:56.169 --> 19:58.666
I am going to put my lowfer so far up your ass

19:58.667 --> 20:00.826
you're gonna have testicles hanging out of your nose.

20:00.827 --> 20:01.972
Now, tell me who you are.

20:02.628 --> 20:04.797
- What's your name again?
- Teddy Buckland.

20:05.426 --> 20:06.281
Ted?

20:09.172 --> 20:12.054
Naaah, he's never gonna believe I did this.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.768
Hey, where'd you go?

20:24.027 --> 20:27.877
I'm sorry sir, we don't have appletinis.
But I could make you a peachtini.

20:28.158 --> 20:31.539
That's a little foofy
for my taste. A beer is fine.

20:32.618 --> 20:34.200
With a pineapple wedge, please.

20:35.886 --> 20:36.534
How you doing?

20:37.501 --> 20:40.816
Not too bad, considering
I just had a bomb dropped on me.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.210
No no, that was bigger than a bomb.

20:44.047 --> 20:46.648
More like an asteroid about to hit the planet.

20:47.192 --> 20:48.976
You know, people running
in the streets screaming,

20:48.977 --> 20:50.695
<i>"Oh my god, it's coming right at us!"</i>

20:51.070 --> 20:53.746
And then dudes turning
to hot chicks and they're all like, "Look,

20:54.056 --> 20:55.934
we're about to die, so can I hit that?"

20:56.309 --> 20:59.136
and then girl's like "Hell, to the no!"
but then she realizes,

20:59.464 --> 21:01.248
"Oh my god, I'm about to die,

21:01.679 --> 21:03.942
so you know what , yeah,
you can hit this, but no kissing."

21:04.928 --> 21:06.862
That's exactly what it's like!

21:07.991 --> 21:08.571
Thank you.

21:08.918 --> 21:11.529
I'm just so mad I litterally
don't know what to say to her.

21:12.102 --> 21:13.369
Don't you dare!

21:15.004 --> 21:17.332
Part of me wants to talk to her,
part of me wants to...

21:17.333 --> 21:17.894
Bust a move?

21:17.895 --> 21:20.487
You have a problem, sir! Seek help!

21:22.440 --> 21:23.492
- You know what you're gonna do?
- What?

21:24.083 --> 21:26.125
You're gonna sit here and wait for Kim,

21:26.210 --> 21:28.379
and then you're gonna talk to her,
because you're a good person.

21:29.802 --> 21:31.919
No matter what mistakes she's made
she's still having your kid,

21:32.051 --> 21:33.365
and you're not walking away from that.

21:38.432 --> 21:43.314
Oh, say, Barbie, I'm gonna go ahead next here
one more time. May I please, please

21:43.474 --> 21:45.737
use your practice's spect camera?

21:46.845 --> 21:48.009
Sure, whatever.

21:48.460 --> 21:50.873
That's great. Cause I've actually already used it.

21:51.943 --> 21:52.675
I don't care.

21:53.239 --> 21:56.666
And don't worry about coming to my wedding,
because it probably won't be one.

21:58.036 --> 21:58.853
Look,

21:59.276 --> 22:02.328
I love it that after six years
I can still mess with your head.

22:02.329 --> 22:04.663
It is both a testament to my commitment

22:04.664 --> 22:08.081
and a glaring statement about
your mental fragility.  But still is

22:08.675 --> 22:10.797
as much as it pains me to say it,

22:11.652 --> 22:14.178
there's nothing I did or said

22:14.534 --> 22:17.961
that had any real impact on your
relationship with the future Mr. Barbie.

22:18.694 --> 22:20.975
Yeah, well, I got all crazy
and went off on him.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.787
Of course you did, you're a woman.

22:23.844 --> 22:27.177
Sure, ya do come with a little extra crazy,

22:27.252 --> 22:30.173
but what the heck, that's what makes you... you.

22:32.135 --> 22:32.689
Listen to me,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.121
Keith isn't going to care, he's not.

22:37.881 --> 22:39.599
Why are you being so nice to me?

22:41.178 --> 22:43.539
Lay off the stick or
I'll wait till you're asleep

22:43.540 --> 22:45.042
and I will cheesegrate your nerps.

22:50.201 --> 22:53.093
Because sometimes I like to do nice
things without being coerced.

22:54.671 --> 22:57.084
- Oh...
- Hopefully that's the right lettering.

23:04.539 --> 23:05.262
You're fine.

23:06.295 --> 23:08.990
Now, if... if you go ahead and excuse me...

23:09.422 --> 23:12.173
I'm gonna go and grab a quick
shower to get this moment offa me.

23:18.108 --> 23:19.863
<i>Turk was giving me the silent treatment</i>

23:19.864 --> 23:22.615
because I had taken
Old MC's advice over his.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.682
<i>I had busted a move, and left.</i>

23:28.653 --> 23:31.554
Oh, no. I'm saving this for someone.
He's should be here in a minute.

23:32.671 --> 23:35.329
<i>And yeah, I still have doubts about my decision.</i>

23:43.357 --> 23:44.287
I love you babe.

23:45.273 --> 23:46.634
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

23:48.869 --> 23:51.123
<i>I guess I'm just hoping
that the doubts will fade away.</i>

24:00.663 --> 24:03.555
<i>Who am I kidding, eventually
we all have to face the music.</i>

24:04.193 --> 24:06.315
-  You wanted to see me, sir?
- I know it was you,

24:06.316 --> 24:08.897
and you are going to pay dearly.

24:09.630 --> 24:11.724
Wait, first of all you need a new doctor.

24:15.039 --> 24:16.663
Ta, ta, ta.

24:16.757 --> 24:19.733
Dr. Toilet? He's beautiful.

24:20.447 --> 24:22.597
I trimmed a little fat in the budget
so we could afford him.

24:23.058 --> 24:25.386
- Ted's vacation pay?
