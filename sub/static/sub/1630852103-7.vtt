the house in front of him being built

is gonna obstruct

-Hey. What's up?
-Hi!

08:01.856 --> 08:03.941
-How are you?
-[Heather] I brought the party today.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.319
This is a first.
I've never seen anything like it.

08:06.402 --> 08:09.113
So we've done our research
on how high you can build.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.742
The building codes allow for 30 feet,
and that includes air-conditioning ducts

08:12.825 --> 08:13.743
and everything else.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
This balloon is two feet tall and this--

08:15.912 --> 08:17.788
-String.
-[Jason] …is 28 feet long.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.374
So if the top of this balloon
is at a manageable level,

08:20.458 --> 08:23.961
like below the ficus or below the top
of the Sierra Towers building,

08:24.045 --> 08:25.087
I think we're good.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.047
I like the idea,

08:26.130 --> 08:29.217
'cause the view is the biggest obstacle
to moving forward on this,

08:29.300 --> 08:31.677
so if we can still have
the full Century City view,

08:31.761 --> 08:35.181
and the ocean, mountains,
then I'm serious about moving forward.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.892
-Really? Okay.
-If not, then it's a deal-breaker.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.645
-It's all about the view.
-So this is our deal-breaker?

08:40.728 --> 08:43.689

Wow. Okay, well, that's not bad at…
Wait. That's not bad at all.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.687
[Jason] No. The land actually slopes down,

09:22.770 --> 09:24.897
so the farther out you go,
the lower it'll be.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.315

I don't think you'll see any of it.

it's not affecting anything.

the better it gets.

your beautiful view, we're obviously…

09:46.627 --> 09:50.381
I know you don't wanna write at 14,
so what are you comfortable coming at?

09:50.464 --> 09:52.967
I'll be really candid with you.
My top line is 12.5.

I don't care how we negotiate it,
I'll leave that to your expertise,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.055

I think either we start at 12
and see what they say,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.936
or we write best and final 12.5,
and then that's it.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.772
And then seal the deal,
and not go back and forth.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.817
No negotiations,
and just take it or leave it.

and let you know what they say,

you're good?

11:57.967 --> 12:02.012

just fell out of escrow, so…

12:02.096 --> 12:03.347
-Ugh!
-[Mary] Oh, no!

12:03.431 --> 12:06.892
Yeah, it's so upsetting
because it was such a great escrow.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.811
You know, it was listed for 1,299,000.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.523
We got an offer for 1,450,000,
which was wonderful.

12:12.606 --> 12:15.276
So I was obviously
a little bit, like, freaking out

12:15.359 --> 12:17.945
because it's the first time
I go through this situation.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.238

12:23.200 --> 12:24.910
This definitely needs the work.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.287
And I was in shock.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.372
I was like, "How am I gonna call my client

12:28.456 --> 12:30.332

Last weekend, I started getting calls

and so I was like, "Ugh!"
You know, I just wasn't answering.

And then I started getting texts,
and it said, "Hi, Miss Smith."

from Child Protective Services."

15:47.947 --> 15:50.032

your children home alone

15:53.619 --> 15:55.496

if there's food in the house for them,

and abusing your children."

I saw that Chrishell bought a house.

-Yeah. I love the house.
-[Davina] Really? Have you seen it?

18:34.404 --> 18:36.323
No, but it's actually two houses down

18:36.406 --> 18:38.826
from the client
I sold a house to two years ago.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.120
Amazing. I heard from some agents

18:41.203 --> 18:42.955
that Jason represented Chrishell.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.248
Have you heard about that?

18:44.331 --> 18:47.042
Come on. She's an agent.
She's done transactions.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.420
When she bought the house with her ex,
she represented them.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.965
So obviously
she's going to represent herself

18:53.048 --> 18:54.675
when she's buying her own house.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.553
I mean, if you cannot
represent yourself as an agent,

18:57.636 --> 19:01.890
why would clients trust you
to represent them on a transaction?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.935
I've no doubt
Chrishell represented herself,

19:05.018 --> 19:07.896
so I don't wanna be part of this gossip.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.482
Do you know what I think
probably happened?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.734
I think she probably did the transaction,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.862
but then for privacy purposes,

19:14.945 --> 19:17.823
if she's gonna be,
basically, the selling agent,

19:17.906 --> 19:20.784
people can put
one and one together with the address,

19:20.868 --> 19:22.828
so it's safe to just say, like, Jason.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.872
Yeah, and he's a broker anyway, so…

19:24.955 --> 19:28.834

and he's also a control freak.

so she might be the new favorite.

and I've accepted I'm not his favorite.

I guess not so much anymore.

It's true, though.
We used to be so close, all of us.

So the fake DMs have started again
from you-know-who.

There's only one person
in the entire world that it could be.

or, "He's doing that." All this stuff.

[Vanessa] What? Wait.
Christine was doing them?

29:40.278 --> 29:43.531

She's done really bad things
to a lot of people.

30:02.842 --> 30:06.763
Christine started these rumors
as to why I was really divorced.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.432
Rumors that I was, like,
sleeping with these people,

30:09.516 --> 30:10.517

30:10.600 --> 30:13.144
I was madly in love with my husband.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.604
I was devastated.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.856
That was her trying to take me down,

30:16.940 --> 30:20.318

to have some traction--

30:20.401 --> 30:23.321
-Makes it seem like you're not sweet.
-It would take me down.

that she's in a lot of need of love.
