WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:01.991
Previously,
on "The Americans."

00:02.000 --> 00:03.706
Directorate
S undercover agents

00:03.710 --> 00:05.302
supposedly hiding
all over the US.

00:05.310 --> 00:08.143
Super secret identities no
one has any idea who they are.

00:08.150 --> 00:08.844
Oh, hi.

00:08.850 --> 00:09.544
You came.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.142
-Just for a second to,
uh, bring over brownies

00:11.150 --> 00:12.378
and welcome you to
the neighbourhood.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.233
-What do you do, Stan?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.935
-I'm an FBI agent.

00:14.940 --> 00:19.070
When we got here,
I was 22 years old living

00:19.080 --> 00:23.483
in a strange house, in a strange
country, with a strange man.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.788
It never really happened for us.

00:25.790 --> 00:26.597
-You're separating?

00:26.600 --> 00:27.794
It's time
you and your source

00:27.800 --> 00:29.563
started having your
meetings in a safe house.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.697
That is our
own private cabana.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.123
-I appreciate what
you're trying to do.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.939
It's not going to fix anything.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.714
-Big day at FBI
Counter Intelligence.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.506
-They were in the
secure vault all day.

00:49.510 --> 00:51.125
-Did you get a look
inside this time?

00:51.130 --> 00:52.347
-There's one move we can make.

00:52.350 --> 00:53.988
We put a bug in Gaad's office.

00:53.990 --> 00:55.491
Martha could do it.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.479
-No knock on the
charms there, Romeo,

00:57.490 --> 00:59.640
but there's no way
she'll go for that.

00:59.650 --> 01:01.777
I pronounce
you man and wife.

01:01.780 --> 01:05.216
-I'm in love with you, and
I will do anything for you.

01:05.220 --> 01:05.948
Mom.

01:05.950 --> 01:06.951
-What are you doing?

01:06.960 --> 01:08.848
-What are you doing?

01:08.850 --> 01:09.805
-Laundry.

01:09.810 --> 01:11.437
-You're doing laundry in
the middle of the night?

01:14.080 --> 01:16.935
-We know that we're looking
for a Caucasian man and woman.

01:16.940 --> 01:17.816
It's a couple.

01:17.820 --> 01:20.482
-Take them out.

01:23.050 --> 01:23.744
-It's OK.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.444
Look at me.

01:24.450 --> 01:25.451
Look at me.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.381
-Her great aunt?

01:26.390 --> 01:27.721
She fell
down the stairs.

01:27.730 --> 01:30.096
Elizabeth may stay up for a
while and take care of her.

01:54.010 --> 01:55.079
-I wish they'd listen to me.

01:55.090 --> 01:56.079
-I'll be all right.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.487
-Hey, if you ever
need me again--

03:02.890 --> 03:04.915
-We let them have Kabul for now.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.502
Attack their supply
routes using small units,

03:07.510 --> 03:08.351
always moving fast.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.840
-Right.

03:10.850 --> 03:13.239
Well, I told the Coordinating
Committee what you asked for,

03:13.250 --> 03:15.992
and the response
was very positive.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.230
Of course, they need to clear
about 15 other committees

03:18.240 --> 03:19.992
every time we go over
a million dollars.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.219
Look, boys, we know
you're good in Herat.

03:23.230 --> 03:26.461
The question is how do we
help you out in Tangier?

03:29.950 --> 03:31.269
-We have a route on the Ruha.

03:32.450 --> 03:33.712
-On the Sahar road.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.876
-You get the weapons to
us from across the border,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.495
we do the rest.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.421
-Right.

03:42.410 --> 03:43.434
-We love America.

03:45.190 --> 03:47.499
-With your guidance and
with the help of Allah,

03:47.500 --> 03:50.583
we will drive the godless
Soviets from Afghanistan.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.718
-And we are going to be there
for you every step of the way.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.711
Money, guns, America's going
to get you whatever you need,

03:55.720 --> 03:56.414
Salar.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.289
-It's good to have
the same enemy.

04:03.290 --> 04:04.222
-Yes, it is.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.280
-This blade is my gift to you.

04:10.290 --> 04:12.394
I killed a Russian
soldier with it.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.391
It was the first
man I ever killed.

04:14.400 --> 04:19.815
It was hard, but it
has gotten easier.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.152
We've killed every heathen
come to humiliate us

04:22.160 --> 04:24.958
on our own land.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.654
-Really?

04:30.930 --> 04:33.012
-You tell your brothers
back in Afghanistan

04:33.020 --> 04:36.740
there's a message for him.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.217
America can't protect you.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.892
Allah can't protect you.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.288
And the KGB is everywhere.

04:54.490 --> 04:57.015
-You Russians have
no Idea who you're--

05:28.960 --> 05:29.949
-It's OK.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.669
-You ready?

07:48.890 --> 07:49.584
-mom!

07:49.590 --> 07:51.569
-Happy Birthday, Henry.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.468
-Don't jump on your mother.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.720
You're getting too big now.

07:54.730 --> 07:57.176
-I miss being jumped on.

08:01.970 --> 08:03.267
You look older to me.

08:03.270 --> 08:04.419
-I am.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.285
-Does our house look the same?

08:06.290 --> 08:08.087
-Yeah, we painted the
living room black.

08:08.090 --> 08:08.784
-Stop it.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.257
You did not.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.238
-Yeah, we did.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.218
Happy birthday!

08:12.220 --> 08:12.914
Thanks.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.653
-I'm just thinking of something
like real food instead of cake.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.490
-OK, OK.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.319
-What do you want?

08:18.320 --> 08:19.264
-I'll have a hot dog.

08:19.270 --> 08:19.952
-OK, one hot dog.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.654
-Thanks.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.775
For the birthday boy.

08:21.780 --> 08:22.838
-OK, here you go.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.034
-Well, maybe next
year, you know?

08:24.040 --> 08:26.224
-We||, hopefully
you can afford it,

08:26.230 --> 08:30.974
because this is
your 100% refund.

08:30.980 --> 08:34.279
-Aw, I really wasn't
expecting anything back.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.099
Definitely not all of it.

08:35.110 --> 08:38.147
-I'm just sorry it took
so long, but the airline

08:38.150 --> 08:40.710
has this whole voucher
BS, so it takes forever.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.529
But there's no reason
to pay for a trIp

08:42.530 --> 08:43.428
you're not going to go on.

08:43.430 --> 08:44.169
-Thanks.

08:44.180 --> 08:45.511
I definitely owe you one.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.136
It's great
she's back, huh?

08:50.140 --> 08:53.041
-You have no idea.

08:53.050 --> 08:54.620
-It's good to see you
guys together again.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.688
Just give it time.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.646
I'm sure you'll get there.

09:05.380 --> 09:06.074
-Yeah.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.776
It's 12 times more
powerful than your old one.

09:15.780 --> 09:19.022
-Oh, it's great.

09:19.030 --> 09:20.543
-Well, that didn't
sound very convincing.

09:20.550 --> 09:21.244
-No.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.194
-No, no, it is.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.076
It is.

09:23.080 --> 09:23.774
Thank you.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.008
-It's just not Intellivision.

09:25.020 --> 09:25.714
-Wait.

09:25.720 --> 09:26.709
What are you talking about?

09:26.710 --> 09:29.156
-Henry keeps begging
Dad for this video game.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.368
-Yeah, which rots your brain
and turns it into this.

09:32.370 --> 09:33.906
And you wanted a new telescope.

09:33.910 --> 09:36.708
-I know.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.948
Let's go set it up in my room.

09:37.950 --> 09:39.986
-Oh, you know what?

09:39.990 --> 09:41.662
Uh, maybe tomorrow night.

09:41.670 --> 09:43.831
Abby's going to be
here in 15 minutes.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.125
-Why?

09:45.130 --> 09:46.984
-I'm going to take
your mom out on a date.

09:46.990 --> 09:47.877
-Tonight?

09:47.880 --> 09:49.233
It's my birthday.

09:49.240 --> 09:49.990
-I know.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.763
-We're going to do a whole
Henry weekend, sweetheart.

09:51.770 --> 09:52.464
-Yeah.

09:52.470 --> 09:53.596
It'll be really fun.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.294
Promise.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.892
-We just need a little time.

09:55.900 --> 09:57.856
-Don't you want mom and
dad to go out on a date?

09:57.860 --> 10:00.272
Yeah, I
missed her, too, pal.

10:00.280 --> 10:03.408
I did.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.888
Oh, gross.

10:05.890 --> 10:07.858
Come on, Paige.

10:40.420 --> 10:41.114
-Airport security.

10:41.120 --> 10:41.814
-Don't move.

10:41.820 --> 10:42.639
-Let's see your hands.

10:42.650 --> 10:43.344
-Nice and slow.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.544
Nice and slow.
-Get your clothes.

10:44.550 --> 10:45.949
_ -Move.
-NIce and slow, easy, easy.

10:45.950 --> 10:46.848
-Come on, this way.

10:46.860 --> 10:47.554
Move.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.845
Move.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.067
Back it up.

10:50.070 --> 10:50.889
Roy Oatway.

10:50.890 --> 10:52.790
Roy Oatway.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.494
Airport security.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.216
-Come on.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.221
-Take a breath.

10:55.230 --> 10:56.151
You're fine.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.548
Calm down.

10:57.550 --> 10:58.562
Roy, your fine.
Look at me.

10:58.570 --> 10:59.264
Look at me.

10:59.270 --> 11:00.089
-Take him to lockup.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.455
Nobody interrogate
him until we get back.

11:08.540 --> 11:09.359
-I haven't done anything.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.975
-Let me ask you a question, Roy.

11:11.980 --> 11:14.403
When you were in high
school in Topeka,

11:14.410 --> 11:15.991
did two cheerleaders
ever ask you

11:16.000 --> 11:18.434
to go at it with them
under the bleachers?

11:18.440 --> 11:21.159
When you were at MIT, did two
gorgeous women ever pick you up

11:21.160 --> 11:24.800
at a bar, take you home,
and screw your brains out?

11:24.810 --> 11:26.038
-It's a question, Roy.

11:26.050 --> 11:26.812
It's a real question.

11:29.550 --> 11:30.619
-No.

11:30.620 --> 11:32.747
-What about when you were
chief budget officer for Bendix

11:32.750 --> 11:35.139
Corporation overseeing
anti-lock break technology,

11:35.140 --> 11:36.562
how many babes were
you banging then, Roy?

11:40.440 --> 11:42.590
-Uh, not a lot.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.216
-So what do you think's so
different about tonight, Roy?

11:45.220 --> 11:46.881
New cologne?

11:46.890 --> 11:48.869
-Or is it just since you
started working for Lockheed?

11:53.200 --> 11:55.577
Do you think it could have some
connection to your security

11:55.580 --> 11:57.434
clearance, and the
SkunloNorks project

11:57.440 --> 11:59.055
they're working on for the DOD?

12:02.650 --> 12:07.440
-I didn't tell them anything.

12:07.450 --> 12:08.519
-You're luclq we got here.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.255
-Am I under arrest?

12:15.260 --> 12:17.296
-No, Roy, you're
not under arrest.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.392
We're not here to arrest you.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.858
We're here to protect
you, and your company,

12:21.860 --> 12:23.725
and the interest of the
United States military.

12:23.730 --> 12:27.439
But you're going to have to
be more careful from now on.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.249
So this is what
we're going to do.

12:29.250 --> 12:33.300
We're going to take apart, we're
going to reconstruct every step

12:33.310 --> 12:36.404
of your security protocol
starting right here, right now.

12:36.410 --> 12:39.061
-You are going to be scrupulous
about your phone logs,

12:39.070 --> 12:41.265
report every new suspicious
social encounter,

12:41.270 --> 12:42.737
especially when
you're travelling.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.822
And you're going to switch out
the codes on your office safe

12:44.830 --> 12:47.446
and briefcase to a rotating
number system we give you

12:47.450 --> 12:49.020
that's going to change
every six weeks.

12:49.030 --> 12:50.839
-OK?

12:50.840 --> 12:52.410
You're fine.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.899
Put your clothes on.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.121
Well,
you'd never know it.

13:09.130 --> 13:11.189
Now, John,
don't worry about it.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.316
You're certainly
never going to be

13:12.320 --> 13:14.185
replaced by a syndicated show.

13:14.190 --> 13:16.522
You are el numero one.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.202
Now haven't I always said that?

13:18.210 --> 13:20.087
Every time
you want something, yeah.

13:20.090 --> 13:20.784
Hah.

13:20.790 --> 13:22.883
VVhat
do you want, Herb?

13:22.890 --> 13:26.018
Just use of _ _
that, oh, so persuaswe vonce

13:26.020 --> 13:29.569
of yours for just three
little 60-second spots.

13:29.570 --> 13:30.605
Forget it, pal.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.224
I'm outta here.

13:31.230 --> 13:32.754
The The
guy asked for you, John.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.840
Aah!

14:24.850 --> 14:26.101
-What the hell?

14:26.110 --> 14:27.998
-What are you doing?

14:28.000 --> 14:28.944
-I'm checking mom's laundry.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.111
-You're checking her laundry?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.166
-I'm doing it.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.967
I'm doing mom's laundry for her.

14:33.970 --> 14:34.789
-Why?

14:34.790 --> 14:38.419
-As a surprise.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.899
-Whatever, weirdo.

14:47.910 --> 14:49.764
-That's a long time to be away.

14:49.770 --> 14:53.183
-Yeah, well, I mean,
I was pretty torn up.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.203
-How did the kids do?

14:55.210 --> 14:57.508
-Uh, you know, we
talked ever week.

14:57.510 --> 14:59.398
They wondered why I wasn't
coming home on weekends.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.391
But I just told them
my aunt was too sick.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.094
I couldn't leave.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.261
-It must have been
strange not seeing them.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.238
-It was hard.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.720
But everyone's OK.

15:08.730 --> 15:11.437
-And you and Philip?

15:11.440 --> 15:14.193
-We're better.

15:14.200 --> 15:14.894
Yeah.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.239
-Good?

15:28.240 --> 15:30.208
-Yeah.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.212
-When you guys head back?

15:32.220 --> 15:34.245
-I pick up my guy's
drop on Saturday

15:34.250 --> 15:35.808
Then the Air and Space Museum.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.436
Then drive late Sunday
night for school Monday.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.759
-Jared's a senior?

15:39.770 --> 15:42.807
-He's going to Carnegie
Mellon next year, engineering.

15:42.810 --> 15:45.426
-Oh, wow, I mean, the
last time we saw you guys,

15:45.430 --> 15:46.749
you were worried
he was spending too

15:46.750 --> 15:48.570
much time building
model airplanes.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.320
-I guess he was an
engineer after all.

15:50.330 --> 15:52.844
-Mechanical like his dad.

15:52.850 --> 15:53.919
-And Amelia?

15:53.930 --> 15:54.954
Ninth grade, cheerleading.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.211
-Oh, my god, no.

15:56.220 --> 15:56.914
-Yes.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.410
Most of our
mother/daughter team has

15:58.420 --> 15:59.887
been cooking for the bake sales.

15:59.890 --> 16:02.415
And then, there's boys, boys.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.196
-Nothing much else to
worry about, these kids.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.864
-Nothing prepares you
for them growing up here.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.155
-You guys are staying
in Alexandria, right?

16:17.160 --> 16:17.888
-Mhm.

16:17.890 --> 16:20.199
-You know, uh, we're
taking the kids

16:20.200 --> 16:22.077
to the rides at the
park on Saturday.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.548
-I'd love to get a look
at Paige and Henry.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.131
-Well, then, we'll
see you there.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.960
We'll be there all day.

16:27.970 --> 16:30.484
-Listen, Claudia
sends her regards.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.946
-She's glad you're OK.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.488
She told us about what
happened between you.

16:35.490 --> 16:36.991
-She still here?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.024
-You know those old war horses.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.305
They don't get pushed
around so easily.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.669
-You OK?

17:00.170 --> 17:03.333
At least you got to be
here for Henry's birthday.

17:03.340 --> 17:05.558
-Yeah, that worked out.

17:05.570 --> 17:06.264
-Yeah.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.410
-You OK?

17:12.420 --> 17:13.114
-Yeah.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.838
I had a thing last night.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.808
I finished up an operation
with some Afghans.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.289
It went bad.

17:43.870 --> 17:44.552
-Henry?

17:49.280 --> 17:52.044
Henry, I don't think
mom and dad came home.

17:52.050 --> 17:53.096
-I don't care.

18:27.810 --> 18:29.949
-Oh, my god.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.212
-Get back in your room, Henry.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.479
So he got the whole apple
in his mouth, but it got stuck.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.937
And Lewis and Jeremy
started tickling him,

18:45.940 --> 18:47.510
and I got worried he might choke.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.602
I mean, you can
choke on an apple,

18:49.610 --> 18:51.805
and he was laughing really hard.

18:51.810 --> 18:54.290
So I made them stop,
and we had to cut

18:54.300 --> 18:56.256
the apple out of his mouth.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.727
In pieces.

18:57.730 --> 19:01.006
He said the next night
his jaw really still hurt.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.227
-I bet.

19:02.230 --> 19:04.403
-Oh, Paige, we gotta go.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.707
-Oh, uh, sweetheart.

19:05.710 --> 19:06.779
Hang on a second.

19:10.860 --> 19:17.789
Uh, privacy and respect, this
is why we have those rules.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.199
-I know.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.610
Why would
you open a closed door?

19:21.620 --> 19:23.588
-Because I missed you, Mom.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.899
And I'm sorry.

19:25.910 --> 19:27.866
-Well, I missed you, too, honey.

19:27.870 --> 19:29.588
And things are going to
get back to normal now.

19:29.590 --> 19:30.284
They are.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.064
Yeah.

19:32.070 --> 19:36.439
But we have to be
able to trust each other, OK?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.089
-I know, I'm sorry.

19:38.090 --> 19:39.626
-It's OK.

19:39.630 --> 19:41.211
It is OK.

19:41.220 --> 19:45.577
Go get your things for school.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.445
-Thank you for doing my laundry.

19:47.450 --> 19:48.769
Let's go, Paige.

19:48.780 --> 19:49.769
Come on.

19:53.270 --> 19:54.464
-What do you think?

19:57.480 --> 20:01.177
-Who knows what's going
on in that little head?

20:01.180 --> 20:05.241
-Probably be a while before
she walks in on us again.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.786
-Based on what she
saw last night,

20:06.790 --> 20:08.929
I'm surprised she even came
downstairs this morning.

20:08.940 --> 20:09.634
-Yeah.

20:13.310 --> 20:16.188
Do we even know if this is the
first time she's checked on us?

20:43.610 --> 20:44.622
-Do you need to switch seats?

20:44.630 --> 20:47.690
-I'm OK.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.089
-Trai|s grow cold, Stan.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.601
Especially when the
people you're chasing

20:51.610 --> 20:52.679
are dead or gone.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.250
-Yeah, I don't know.

20:54.260 --> 20:58.367
-Do you trust your source?

20:58.370 --> 20:59.758
-Yes.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.241
-So she died.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.148
And he's been exfiltrated.

21:06.790 --> 21:09.281
It's just been a
couple of months.

21:09.290 --> 21:10.928
We have to wait
for the next break.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.603
-I've never been very
good at waiting, sir.

21:19.410 --> 21:20.843
-He's here again.

21:20.850 --> 21:23.159
Said he wouldn't leave
until he talked to you.

21:23.170 --> 21:24.762
I had them send him up.

21:24.770 --> 21:26.829
You _want me to have
security throw him out?

21:26.840 --> 21:28.068
-No.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.389
I'll meet him by the elevators.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.583
I'll be right back.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.209
-You promised me.

22:01.210 --> 22:02.086
We had a deal.

22:02.090 --> 22:02.784
It was signed.

22:02.790 --> 22:03.484
-First, shut up.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.640
-I'm not going to
shut up. $500,000.

22:05.650 --> 22:06.594
I did my part.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.430
I want my money.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.419
-The thing is you didn't
do your part, Sanford.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.001
Not one of your
leads panned out.

22:11.010 --> 22:12.329
We got nothing from you.

22:12.330 --> 22:13.695
-I gave-- I gave
you the illegal.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.053
I gave you Colonel Rennhull.
I gave you everything.

22:15.060 --> 22:15.754
-Listen to me.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.979
Your illegal with the Morticia
Addams hair and the hot skirts

22:18.980 --> 22:21.813
is a fantasy you've been jerking
off to as far as we can tell.

22:21.820 --> 22:22.787
She doesn't exist.

22:22.790 --> 22:23.609
No, she's real.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.417
And Colonel Rennhull
reported your approach

22:25.420 --> 22:27.411
to airport security
the following day.

22:27.420 --> 22:29.308
She said a creepy
guy from the Pentagon

22:29.310 --> 22:31.790
asked them if he'd be interested
in meeting with the KGB.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.494
-That's bullshit.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.819
-He described you to a T.

22:33.830 --> 22:34.524
-That's bullshit.

22:34.530 --> 22:35.713
He was covering his tracks.

22:35.720 --> 22:36.664
He went for--

22:36.670 --> 22:40.424
-Well, maybe, but you're
a compulsive gambler

22:40.430 --> 22:42.443
with a very dubious
record at DOD.

22:42.450 --> 22:45.044
And he is clean as a whistle.

22:45.050 --> 22:47.154
So read the agreement.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.664
It's contingent on us getting
something firm for our money.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.195
-I gave you everything I had.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.408
You people betrayed me.

22:57.900 --> 23:01.233
-Don't come back here, Sanford,
unless it's to thank me

23:01.240 --> 23:04.038
for keeping your
ass out of lockup.

23:14.380 --> 23:15.415
I believe him.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.342
-Mi|itary Intelligence
doesn't agree.

23:17.350 --> 23:19.864
-Well, that's because he's a
scumbag traitor who's personal

23:19.870 --> 23:21.986
life is a mess, but
that doesn't mean--

23:21.990 --> 23:23.787
-But it goes down.

23:23.790 --> 23:25.326
If the Colonel
stays there in his office

23:25.330 --> 23:29.016
with his clearance, it's
going to come back on us, bad.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.238
-The Colonel is off limits.

23:31.250 --> 23:34.504
My rope is more than used up.

23:34.510 --> 23:36.125
This is how it works.

23:36.130 --> 23:37.848
When they want you
to do something,

23:37.850 --> 23:40.034
but they can't ask you to do it.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.689
It goes wrong.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.612
They start investigating you.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.906
Soviet foreign
minister wasn't pleased

23:46.910 --> 23:49.549
that one of his diplomats got
shot in the back of the head.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.371
Sir, his body was
found in a dumpster.

23:52.380 --> 23:53.449
DC's a dangerous place.

23:53.460 --> 23:56.099
-The State keeps
asking questions.

23:56.110 --> 23:58.089
I can't really give any answers.

23:58.090 --> 23:59.899
Someone may have
to take the fall.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.357
Someone always takes the fall.

24:05.820 --> 24:06.730
-Agent Gaad's office.

24:06.740 --> 24:10.369
For
now, be smart with the colonel.

24:10.370 --> 24:13.032
The less attention we
attract, the better.

24:13.040 --> 24:13.984
Yes, sir.

24:13.990 --> 24:14.979
-I don't suppose that's ready.

24:14.990 --> 24:15.684
-Uh-hmm.

24:15.690 --> 24:18.147
-It is?

24:18.150 --> 24:21.017
Philip, you want to take
these home for the kids?

24:21.020 --> 24:23.295
Can you just wrap
two slices, and then

24:23.300 --> 24:24.870
you and Barb can split the rest.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.381
-Oh, my roommate is on a diet.

24:26.390 --> 24:28.164
He'd kill me ifI
bring home cake.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.503
-You had a good
couple of months.

24:34.510 --> 24:36.444
-Yeah, we did.

24:36.450 --> 24:39.533
-This is Stan here, right?

24:39.540 --> 24:40.256
This one?

24:40.260 --> 24:40.954
-Yeah.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.827
-I thought we got him a refund.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.388
-No, I got him the voucher.

24:45.390 --> 24:46.527
Trade in 40%.

24:46.530 --> 24:47.758
We pay the difference.

24:47.770 --> 24:48.839
I figure in the long run--

24:48.840 --> 24:49.534
-Good.

24:55.050 --> 24:57.234
-Agent Beeman, what I'm showing
you, not a lot of people

24:57.240 --> 24:58.423
know about.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.557
You know, if word gets out--

25:00.560 --> 25:01.401
-Oh, you can trust me.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.355
-You know, it's evidence.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.452
-I-- I understand.

25:08.680 --> 25:12.707
So these guys are pirating new
stuff out in the theatres now?

25:12.710 --> 25:14.814
-Yep.

25:14.820 --> 25:15.980
We already had three raids.

25:15.990 --> 25:18.970
I'm expecting another
shipment next week.

25:18.980 --> 25:20.049
-What's this one?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.982
-Guys on motorcycles after
the world's destroyed.

25:21.990 --> 25:23.139
It's pretty good.

25:23.140 --> 25:27.224
But, if you want to make
her cry, show her this.

25:27.230 --> 25:31.803
It will bore you to tears,
but your wife will love it.

25:31.810 --> 25:36.395
I have set
myself beyond the pale.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.628
I am nothing.

25:40.510 --> 25:45.095
I am hardly human anymore.

25:45.100 --> 25:49.582
I am the French
Lieutenant's whore.

25:55.660 --> 25:57.104
-You don't like it?

25:57.110 --> 26:00.557
-No, I think it's good.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.606
You believe her?

26:01.610 --> 26:02.998
-The woman?

26:03.000 --> 26:03.898
-The actress.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.491
-Well, that's Meryl Streep.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.150
What?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.162
You think she's too what?

26:11.170 --> 26:14.583
-I think she's too much of
what a man thinks a woman is.

26:14.590 --> 26:16.592
What she wants her to be.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.400
Why, if she loves him,
does it make her a whore?

26:20.410 --> 26:22.150
Was Anna Karenina
a whore because she

26:22.160 --> 26:25.277
gave her heart, her
life to Vronslq?

26:27.860 --> 26:30.294
"Anna Karenina"-- you
heard of this book?

26:30.300 --> 26:31.164
-Yeah, I heard of it.

26:31.170 --> 26:34.458
I never had the pleasure.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.020
-Is that how you see me?

26:37.020 --> 26:41.400
What I am to you, a whore?

26:41.410 --> 26:42.229
-Oh, it's a movie, Nina.

26:42.230 --> 26:44.039
I thought-- I thought
you'd like it.

26:44.050 --> 26:45.608
-You thought it
would make me cry.

26:45.620 --> 26:46.314
-No.

26:46.320 --> 26:50.450
I-- I thought it would move you.

26:50.460 --> 26:53.099
-Oh, you see, I'm very moved.

26:53.100 --> 26:54.488
Are you happy now?

26:54.490 --> 26:55.184
-Nina.

27:01.130 --> 27:05.738
-We have a new arrival
at the Rezidentura.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.014
-Really?

27:07.020 --> 27:10.092
-Oleg Igorevich Burov.

27:10.100 --> 27:12.614
First tour officer,
but in charge

27:12.620 --> 27:16.761
of Line X Science
and Technology.

27:16.770 --> 27:19.785
-What do you think of him?

27:19.790 --> 27:26.354
--He's a bad mattress.

27:26.360 --> 27:27.190
Too soft.

27:38.540 --> 27:43.500
-You think you can find
out a specific target?

27:43.510 --> 27:49.119
-I can listen, maybe
ask a few questions.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.109
-Be careful.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.610
-Oh, my god.

28:15.620 --> 28:16.609
-Ah-ha-ha-ha!

28:20.610 --> 28:22.589
-Was that fun?

28:22.600 --> 28:25.091
-Yeah.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.089
Aaaagh.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.579
-Make him stop.

28:30.590 --> 28:32.569
-Come on!

28:32.580 --> 28:34.070
Go!

28:34.080 --> 28:35.877
Ah!

28:35.880 --> 28:36.574
Go!

28:39.570 --> 28:40.559
-Do you like this side?

28:40.570 --> 28:41.298
I got, like, a flower.

28:41.300 --> 28:42.062
-I do.

28:42.070 --> 28:42.752
-Do you like it?

28:45.560 --> 28:47.050
-GOI gO, gO, go, 90!

28:47.060 --> 28:48.345
Go, go, go!

28:49.750 --> 28:50.546
-Oh, yes!

28:53.540 --> 28:55.792
-Hey, Dad, you want this?

28:55.800 --> 28:58.086
-Oh, sure, it's going to
look great in her bedroom?

28:58.090 --> 29:00.991
-Oh, can-- can go back to the
hotel so I can go swimming?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.423
-We'll go back in
a little while.

29:06.820 --> 29:07.787
-Come on, guys.

29:07.790 --> 29:09.724
I wanna go on the bumper cars.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.454
-Oleg Igorevich.

31:54.330 --> 31:55.024
-Beeman.

31:57.590 --> 31:58.602
We need to take a drive.

31:58.610 --> 31:59.520
-A drive?

31:59.530 --> 32:00.667
-To the Colonel's house.

32:19.930 --> 32:21.545
Colonel Rennhull.

32:21.550 --> 32:22.824
-Agent Gaad.

32:22.830 --> 32:23.524
Agent Beeman.

32:23.530 --> 32:24.679
Thank you both for coming.

32:24.690 --> 32:26.499
-Are you all right?

32:26.510 --> 32:28.580
-I guess.

32:28.590 --> 32:30.285
Uh, he just showed up.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.326
And he started screaming
I'm going to kill you.

32:32.330 --> 32:33.024
You ruined my life.

32:33.030 --> 32:34.782
Something about $500,000.

32:34.790 --> 32:37.315
He's crazy.

32:37.320 --> 32:40.073
My wife's inside.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.559
He just started coming at me.

32:41.560 --> 32:45.075
-You had the weapon on you?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.082
-I got it when I saw
him pull in the drive.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.426
I mean, he's the guy.

32:53.430 --> 32:56.445
He's the one who approached
me that I reported.

32:56.450 --> 32:59.567
-Yes, he is.

32:59.570 --> 33:01.413
-I really should
get back inside.

33:01.420 --> 33:02.478
My wife is not good.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.174
-Of course.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.249
-You take care.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.861
Give me a minute, guys.

33:10.870 --> 33:11.757
-Yes, sir.

33:17.660 --> 33:20.652
-You'd think one in the
head would have been enough.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.354
-Yeah.

33:24.650 --> 33:27.039
-Oh, my god, mom, it's
like she knows you.

33:27.050 --> 33:28.529
-Yeah, can she do me next?

33:28.540 --> 33:30.576
-Well, I'll read
you palm, Henry.

33:30.580 --> 33:32.024
Oh, you're short--

33:35.890 --> 33:38.108
-I'||, uh, I'll see you
at the balloon dart.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.997
I'm gonna grab some water.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.669
-An agent called the service.

33:46.670 --> 33:47.534
Surveillance tightened.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.349
We can't do a dead drop.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.793
I had to change things up.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.267
I have them coming
here to do a pass.

33:52.270 --> 33:53.134
It can't be me.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.676
I've been on for
the last two days.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.738
His tails might have seen me.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.434
-When?

33:56.440 --> 33:59.000
-About three minutes.

33:59.010 --> 34:02.901
He's in grey pants, grey blazer,
a green tie with white pattern.

34:02.910 --> 34:04.389
He's going to be
looking for a blue hat,

34:04.390 --> 34:06.779
and an 11-year-old boy.

34:06.790 --> 34:08.473
-We don't use our kids.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.038
-Nah, it's just a brush pass.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.836
He's got two tails and
a surveillance team

34:11.840 --> 34:12.841
about five feet behind him.

34:12.850 --> 34:15.057
They won't look twice at
a father with his child.

34:15.060 --> 34:16.357
But you alone,
they might notice.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.476
We need the cover.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.799
We have to move.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.949
Leanne'll block for you.

34:20.950 --> 34:22.815
After you get it, do 45 minutes
of clearing on your own.

34:22.820 --> 34:26.176
Then bring the package
to my hotel, Room 1123.

34:26.180 --> 34:28.967
I may have to run
the kids somewhere.

34:28.970 --> 34:30.790
So wait for me if
I'm not back yet.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.131
Because operational
report sounds bad,

34:32.140 --> 34:33.539
I'm going to need your
guys' help take out

34:33.540 --> 34:35.849
a surveillance team,
so I can get him out.

34:35.850 --> 34:36.669
-Take out?

34:36.670 --> 34:38.877
We have our children here.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.245
-So do we.

34:40.250 --> 34:40.944
Two minutes.

34:54.050 --> 34:54.800
-Do you mind?

34:54.810 --> 34:56.107
Let's get some ice
cream for the girls.

34:56.110 --> 34:56.974
-All right.

34:56.980 --> 35:00.404
-I want the duck.

35:36.410 --> 35:39.390
-You promised to play
another game with me.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.881
-You can make friends with them.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.379
-Oh, there you are.

35:59.390 --> 36:02.188
Listen, last ride and then
back to the hotel, OK?

36:05.130 --> 36:07.576
-What the hell was
that all about?

36:07.580 --> 36:08.558
-I'll tell you on the way.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.006
Let's go.

36:11.010 --> 36:12.568
-I'll give the kids
money for more rides.

36:39.370 --> 36:40.064
-Emmett.

37:03.260 --> 37:04.909
Paige and Henry, go.

38:14.130 --> 38:16.109
-No,no.

38:20.110 --> 38:21.896
Henry!

38:21.900 --> 38:22.594
Henry!

38:25.510 --> 38:26.204
Hen!

38:26.210 --> 38:27.609
What?

38:27.620 --> 38:29.030
-Wait, where's Paige?

38:29.040 --> 38:31.383
-Um, she just took off.

38:31.390 --> 38:32.789
-OK, come with me.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.745
-Uh, but mom, I
wanted to ride again.

38:34.750 --> 38:35.751
-Look, no, I'm sorry.
It's time to go.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.239
We just have to
find your sister.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.149
Paige!

39:01.150 --> 39:04.130
-Hi, mom.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.563
-Why didn't you stay
with your brother?

39:06.570 --> 39:09.368
-I just wanted to
get my face painted.

39:09.370 --> 39:10.917
-Guys, come on.

39:10.920 --> 39:11.648
It's getting late.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.311
Sorry.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.662
Let's go.

39:14.670 --> 39:16.149
-Are you guys OK?

39:16.160 --> 39:17.149
-Yeah, yeah.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.502
There's nothing
in the operation report.

40:46.510 --> 40:49.240
Just routine surveillance, but
there's an address in Virginia

40:49.250 --> 40:50.740
two hours south
of the naval base.

40:50.750 --> 40:52.638
And these sketches,
looks like a propeller,

40:52.640 --> 40:53.857
machine tool, something.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.669
-We||, whatever it
is, Emmett and Leeanne

40:55.670 --> 40:57.206
were in a hell of
a hurry to get it.

40:57.210 --> 41:00.646
-I know.

41:00.650 --> 41:01.867
-I'll go-- I'll go signal now.

41:01.870 --> 41:02.609
-No,no.

41:02.610 --> 41:03.531
You, uh, you rest up.

41:03.540 --> 41:04.825
I'll do it.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.768
I should have done
it without Henry,

41:09.770 --> 41:11.328
even if I was more exposed.

41:11.330 --> 41:14.003
-You didn't have time to think.

41:14.010 --> 41:16.092
You're supposed to be
with Martha tonight?

41:16.100 --> 41:18.193
-No, no, I'm not going
to make an excuse.

41:18.200 --> 41:21.226
-No, If the FBI were part of
this, if they knew about this,

41:21.230 --> 41:22.652
we need to find out.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.592
You need to go.

41:23.600 --> 41:24.419
I'll stay up.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.149
Who would do this?

41:30.150 --> 41:32.061
-You want the list?

41:35.440 --> 41:36.498
Someone who knows us?

41:36.500 --> 41:37.683
Every single one of us.

41:37.690 --> 41:39.829
Someone who knows the
operation, In which case,

41:39.840 --> 41:41.796
they may or may not have
caught at the end of it.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.519
Like surveillance on_ the
operation that we missed.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.680
-It's half the list.

41:45.690 --> 41:48.045
-You want me to finish it?

41:48.050 --> 41:51.508
-Not really.

41:51.510 --> 41:55.469
Elizabeth, 1'”
be back as soon as I can.

41:55.470 --> 41:56.459
-I know.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.694
Somewhere along the line,

42:03.700 --> 42:05.304
encounter yourself.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.289
Shake hands and say,
hi, where the hell

42:07.290 --> 42:09.258
have you been all these years?

42:09.260 --> 42:12.240
Well, now that we're together,
we can go our separate ways.

42:12.250 --> 42:13.581
-Stan?

42:13.590 --> 42:14.386
-Hey.

42:14.390 --> 42:17.268
-What are you doing here?

42:17.270 --> 42:20.216
-Oh, I had to talk to
somebody in Arlington.

42:20.220 --> 42:24.020
It wasn't worth driving
back to the office.

42:24.030 --> 42:24.849
Where's Matthew?

42:24.850 --> 42:27.933
-Uh, he's having
dinner at Craig's.

42:27.940 --> 42:28.964
I didn't know you'd be home.

42:28.970 --> 42:31.700
I made plans to see a
movie with Trish and Marie.

42:31.710 --> 42:32.472
-It's OK.

42:35.510 --> 42:37.375
-I can heat up
leftovers before I go.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.473
Or there's French bread
pizza In the freezer.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.174
-That's all right.

42:40.180 --> 42:42.136
I'm not really hungry.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.313
Touch like you've

42:45.320 --> 42:46.685
never touched before.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.214
Look like you never
looked before.

42:48.220 --> 42:49.744
Hear like you've
never heard before.

42:51.430 --> 42:53.102
Who is that?

42:53.110 --> 42:54.759
-Leo Buscaglia.

42:54.760 --> 42:59.140
He's-- well, they call
him the Love Doctor.

42:59.150 --> 43:02.358
He says he can change the
whole world with a hug.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.099
Really?

43:03.110 --> 43:03.804
-Mhm.

43:03.810 --> 43:05.141
-It looks like he's
trying to change

43:05.150 --> 43:08.278
his world with a pledge drive.

43:08.280 --> 43:11.101
-It's for PBS, not him.

43:11.110 --> 43:11.804
Mm.

43:16.120 --> 43:22.229
-You know, he says that
the greatest hazard in life

43:22.240 --> 43:24.174
is to risk nothing.

43:24.180 --> 43:24.874
-OK.

43:29.070 --> 43:32.312
-He says that loves
always open arms.

43:32.320 --> 43:37.189
That if you close your arms to
love that you'll find you're

43:37.190 --> 43:38.782
left just holding only yourself.

43:54.170 --> 43:57.219
Anyway, that's what
he's famous for.

44:02.040 --> 44:05.373
Do you want to come with us?

44:05.380 --> 44:06.199
To the movies?

44:09.200 --> 44:10.679
-Uh, sure.

44:19.660 --> 44:21.799
I knew it was
ordained that I should never

44:21.800 --> 44:26.851
marry an equal, so
I married shame.

44:26.860 --> 44:30.193
It is my shame that has
kept me alive by knowing

44:30.200 --> 44:34.216
that I am truly not
like other women.

44:34.220 --> 44:37.519
I shall never, like
them, have children,

44:37.520 --> 44:40.262
a husband, the
pleasures of a home.

44:40.270 --> 44:42.647
Sometimes I pity them.

44:42.650 --> 44:46.165
I have a freedom they
cannot understand.

44:46.170 --> 44:49.048
No insult, no
blame, can touch me.

44:55.050 --> 44:58.383
It's just
hard, this job.

44:58.390 --> 45:00.836
This life.

45:00.840 --> 45:05.140
It gets to you in ways
you didn't think it would.

45:05.150 --> 45:08.039
And it isn't easy for
me to talk about this,

45:08.040 --> 45:13.228
but I sometimes wonder
if I'm cut out for this.

45:16.910 --> 45:17.820
I don't know.

45:17.830 --> 45:18.876
I can't get into it.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.451
It was just a--
it was a hard day.

45:21.460 --> 45:24.293
It was a bad day.

45:24.300 --> 45:26.291
-It's OK, sweetie.

45:26.300 --> 45:28.734
Just relax.

45:28.740 --> 45:31.709
No, relax.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.709
Mm?

45:32.710 --> 45:33.699
You're home now.
