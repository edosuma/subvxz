WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.141
- Thoughts on Passover.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.744
You wake up.

00:10.811 --> 00:15.049
Two words emblazoned
 on your chest.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.617
It's time.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.552
You're gonna
 make a break for freedom.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.489
You will not be
 a slave anymore.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.024
You get out of bed,
 you grab your things,

00:24.092 --> 00:26.060
you run outside,

00:26.127 --> 00:28.796
and then...

00:28.862 --> 00:30.531
there you are.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.267
Free.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.303
First light of day.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.604
Behind you is your past.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.306
Everything you came from.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.774
Everything that you
 thought you knew.

00:40.841 --> 00:41.809
You start running.

00:44.912 --> 00:48.149
As you run, you listen for
 the voice of the divine.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.984
But you hear nothing.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
So you stop.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.355
You listen closer.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.227
What-- what is that?
 Is it nothing?

00:59.293 --> 01:01.529
No. It is stillness.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.370
Oh, there's my purse.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.304
How you doin'
 this morning?

02:50.371 --> 02:51.739
I'm good.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.141
I just said a u revoir
to your love.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.343
- Oh, yeah?
 - Yeah.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.910
That's a pretty shawl.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.946
Yeah.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.648
It's pashmina.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.715
Blue. You like?

03:01.782 --> 03:02.816
It's a nice color.

03:02.883 --> 03:03.884
- Yeah?
 - Looks good on you.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.753
- Really?
 - Uh-huh.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.266
You okay?

03:18.332 --> 03:19.867
Yeah. I'm all right.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.134
Yeah.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.537
Everything's great.
Vicki loves me.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.607
And she's--
 she's great.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.878
And, uh, my kids
 are doing great.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.847
I mean, they love me and
 they accept me for who I am.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.285
You got--
 the kids invited you

03:37.351 --> 03:38.652
to the birthday
party Saturday?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.687
- They did.
 - You coming?

03:39.753 --> 03:42.022
- I am coming.
 - Oh, my--

03:42.089 --> 03:45.526
my thing I do at
 the LGBT call center
 is wonderful.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.194
I'm just getting started,

03:47.261 --> 03:49.430
but I'm excited to learn
 about that whole world.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.567
I've got everything I need.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.641
So...

04:03.477 --> 04:05.313
why am I so unhappy?

04:16.223 --> 04:18.091
- Does anyone want
 the sprinkles?
 - No, you take it.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.793
- How about we split it?
 - You want the sprinkles?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.028
- No, no.
- Do you want-- Yeah,
I want the sprinkles.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.029
Why are you spitting?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.564
'Cause I'm vegan.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.367
Can I just say that
 I have really enjoyed

04:26.434 --> 04:28.101
sharing the transbrella
with all of you.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.303
I'm not trans.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.471
- You're not?
 - No.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.239
- Baxter's intersex.
 - Ohh.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.375
I was born with,
 quote-unquote,
 ambiguous genitalia.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.143
- Oh.
- And I'm one of those.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.978
- Oh, yes.
 - You've heard me--
 Seen me on "Oprah."

04:38.045 --> 04:39.680
- Mm-hm.
 - Not me but, like,
 my people.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.682
I have seen one of you
 on "Oprah."

04:41.749 --> 04:43.817
The book that I read
 was from 2014,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.186
and it had--
 it had a graphic--

04:46.253 --> 04:47.120
- Ooh, that's me.
 It's my turn.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.722
- Okay.
- No.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.324
- I thought it was--
 - It's her turn.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.425
- Oh, yeah, it's my turn.
 - I thought it was MOBS.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.060
Maura goes first.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.362
What's MOBS?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.430
Maura, Omar,
 Baxter.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.265
No, I think I'm next,
 though.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.633
I think I'm before you.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.701
No. I'm gonna
 take this call.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.969
- It's me.
 - No.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.604
- I think it's me.
 - I think--

05:03.671 --> 05:05.172
LA Call Line.
 I'm here to help.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.774
- I think he likes
 hearing sad things.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.510
- Oh, man.
 It was just a hang up.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.780
- Oh, that's all I get.
 - That's all I've ever had
 is crank call,

05:12.846 --> 05:15.349
- wrong call.
 - Most of us just get
 crank calls.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.051
- That's you now.
 - Go ahead, Maura.
 - C'est moi.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.259
LA Call Line,
 I'm here to help you.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.061
How can I help?

05:31.432 --> 05:34.935
I'm sorry, can you speak up?
 I can-- I can hardly hear you.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.337
- I said today was
 really fuckin' hard.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.873
And I know there's gonna be,
 like, hard days and stuff,

05:39.940 --> 05:43.444
but today was
 really fuckin' hard.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.878
I got up at 5 a.m.,

05:44.945 --> 05:47.481
and I took the bus
 all the way across town

05:47.548 --> 05:49.383
to go to the
 stupid fuckin' clinic,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.452
and I waited
 for five hours

05:51.519 --> 05:52.686
all for the doctor to say
 I'm not old enough,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.121
and I'm not in the system,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.490
and I need my fuckin'
 foster parents

05:56.557 --> 05:59.860
who won't do shit but
 take the check they get
 every single month.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.161
Mm-hm.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.096
I just feel like
 I'm drowning,

06:03.163 --> 06:06.366
like, I just don't
 want to do this anymore.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.235
So, you know,
 you're asking me how
 you're gonna help me,

06:08.301 --> 06:09.770
like, why don't you just
 tell me why

06:09.837 --> 06:13.006
I shouldn't just
 kill myself.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.608
Um...

06:14.675 --> 06:15.876
No, you said you were
 gonna help me,

06:15.943 --> 06:18.512
so what am I
 supposed to do now?

06:18.579 --> 06:22.049
Um... sounds
very difficult.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.718
Difficult. That's a good
 fuckin' word for it.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.386
- Have you been drinking?
 - What?

06:26.454 --> 06:28.422
Just scratch that.
Uh, I'm sorry.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.958
Um, have you
 felt this way before?

06:31.024 --> 06:34.862
Where the fuck are you
 getting these questions
 from, man, seriously?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.367
Well, I'm not a man,
 actually,

06:40.434 --> 06:43.403
I'm-- I'm--
I'm trans.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.874
Oh. Well, shit.
 I'm trans, too.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.080
Hey, uh,
 what's your name?

06:53.146 --> 06:55.282
Elizah.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.117
My name is Maura.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.652
Where are you right now?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.253
At St. Christopher's,
 the clinic.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.955
St. Christopher's?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.624
- Yes.
 - Hold on one second.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.892
Um, can I ask you,
 are you, um--

07:04.958 --> 07:06.927
Do you have, um--
Is your mom around?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.129
Look, my mom doesn't give
 a shit about me, all right?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.565
Mom.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.201
You wouldn't get it, okay?
You wouldn't get it.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
I would get it, actually.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.304
Um, I-- I wasn't raised
by my mom.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.808
My mom was never around.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.243
Mm-mm. Both my sister
 and me were--

07:23.310 --> 07:25.378
We were raised by--

07:25.445 --> 07:27.581
We were raised by
 my grandparents.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.182
My mom didn't care.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.619
I bet it was nothin' like
 what I got.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.554
This is my fourth
 foster family.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.523
I bet you don't even
 fuckin' understand
 what it's like.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.457
Have you ever been to
 South L.A.?

07:37.525 --> 07:38.992
Probably not,
 so you wouldn't even
 fuckin' get it,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.794
so this conversation
 is pointless,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.963
so I'm just gonna
 fucking go now

07:43.030 --> 07:45.265
- and I don't want to
 - All right, all right,

07:45.332 --> 07:46.767
- hold on, hold on, hold.
 - You don't understand.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.235
- Hey, Elizah, hold on.
- It's just too much.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.838
Hold on, hold on.
 Just hold on for a second.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.674
Can you do me a favor?
 Can you breathe?

07:53.741 --> 07:55.442
No, hell, no,
 fuck this shit.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.244
- W hat are you,
 a fuckin' therapist? No.
- No, no, no.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.246
- Just walk to a safe place.
 - Fuck this.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.413
- Wherever you are just--
- Where the fuck am
 I supposed to go?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.982
I'm at a fuckin' clinic.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.684
Find somewhere there's space,
 where you're alone.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.085
Just-- Please?

08:12.425 --> 08:14.695
Are you walking?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.497
- Yes.
- Yeah?

08:23.103 --> 08:24.772
You there?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.074
I want you to breathe
 with me, okay?

08:27.140 --> 08:28.508
I'm doing it with you.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.612
All right,
 just breathe in
 through your nostrils

08:31.679 --> 08:36.616
- And-- and now breathe out
 through your mouth.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.854
- Let's breathe in

08:40.921 --> 08:43.222
And breathe out
 through your mouth, okay?

08:53.601 --> 08:56.503
Oh, sweetie, okay, okay.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.372
- I'm here.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.841
- All right.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.584
I'm here.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.296
I can't, I have to go.

09:28.035 --> 09:28.902
Elizah?

09:32.539 --> 09:34.074
Elizah?

09:34.141 --> 09:37.344
Uh, TV dinners.
Probably those
Lean Cuisines,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.647
but, you know, you need
like three of them
for them to fill you up.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.181
- Oh.
- I don't eat that shit.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.851
I just had a call that
 just went way wrong.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.052
I mean, way wrong.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.120
I think I really
 screwed up.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.622
- It's okay, boo.
 - What happened?

09:50.390 --> 09:53.560
- I have to go.
- I mean, all you
can do is your best.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.828
I mean, we can't
 save everyone,

09:54.895 --> 09:57.030
we're not therapists
 or case managers.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.668
You're just here
 to provide support and--

10:15.949 --> 10:17.584
- To keep yourself warm,

10:17.651 --> 10:20.287
you re-tell your story
 of escape.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.124
You repeat it to yourself
 over and over again.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.192
I got out.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.432
Now you look over
 your shoulder.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.834
Is someone coming after me?

10:33.901 --> 10:36.203
Or is someone
 coming to save me?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.503
- Thank you.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.706
Sign at the bottom.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.441
- I take it
 Darryl's been absent.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.675
I don't know much
 about him.

11:15.743 --> 11:20.413
- Yeah, well, uh--

11:20.480 --> 11:22.916
I haven't really been
 talking with him.
 Do you have your I.D.?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.585
- He's got how many
 strikes now?

11:25.652 --> 11:26.820
- Honestly,
like, strike 67.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.321
- Yeah.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.890
- Excuse me. Um--
- Which is good,
though.

11:29.957 --> 11:30.858
Hi. Just sign your name
 at the bottom.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.193
Oh, I'm not a patient.

11:33.260 --> 11:39.099
Um, this person here,
number eight, Elizah P.
Uh, I'm looking--

11:39.166 --> 11:40.533
You're actually not supposed
 to be looking at that.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.602
It's confidential
 information.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.071
Then why do you
have it out?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.839
It's for people to sign,
 not to read.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.578
I'm looking for a friend
 and I think that's her.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.646
Are you planning to
 meet here?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.349
Oh, no, but, uh--
but she's, uh--

11:56.416 --> 11:58.551
She's a friend and, uh, I--
I'm very worried about her.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.654
I was wondering if, uh,
 could you tell me anything
 about her?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.291
- Just anything.
 - I can't give any
 information out.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.859
- I'm sorry.
- It's really important.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.668
You said you were
looking for Elizah?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.105
I am.
 Do you know Elizah?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.273
Are you, like,
from child services
or something?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.842
No, no, I've never
 met her before,

12:21.909 --> 12:23.176
but she's in
 a lot of trouble.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.511
Do you know anything
 about her?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.546
Um, she has
bright green hair.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.782
Okay.
 Do you happen to know
 where she is?

12:28.849 --> 12:31.218
Yeah.
 She said she was headed to
 the Slauson Swap Meet.

12:31.284 --> 12:34.021
- The Slauson Swap Meet?
- The Slauson Swap Meet.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.023
I have no idea
 what that is.
 What is that?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.959
It's a big mall, it's
 about two blocks that way.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.127
- Two blocks.
 - Yeah.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.528
- Thank you.
 - Uh-huh.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.584
- Soul. Get your soul.
 Get some poetry in your life.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.453
Get the culture.
Want the soul?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.388
Get poetry in your life.
You need some culture.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.090
Slauson soul.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.658
You don't have a soul
 without the soul.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.794
Soul.
 Get your soul.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.658
Damn,
 I wanted some curl.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.927
That's so wrong.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.862
Excuse me.
 Can I ask you a question?

14:22.930 --> 14:25.966
Um... esta familia.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.740
Yo estoy, uh,

14:33.806 --> 14:36.977

14:37.044 --> 14:38.645
- Nice to meet you.
 - Hi. Reyna.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.879

14:39.947 --> 14:41.381
Nice to meet you.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.849
I'm looking for, uh,
 this young girl

14:42.916 --> 14:44.051
who's in, I think,
a lot of trouble.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.318
He names is Elizah.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.220
- Elizah.
- And I'm very worried.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.122
She's also a trans,
and, uh--

14:49.189 --> 14:50.523
What does she look like?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.092
- Well, she has green hair--
 - Uh-huh.

14:52.159 --> 14:55.295
Maybe you've seen her
on the streets, Elizah.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.497
- Q ue, quÃ©?
 - Uh--

14:57.564 --> 14:58.999
What streets?

14:59.066 --> 15:00.968
- You know, uh, well--
 - La calla dijo.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.736
- No, no, no, not, not--

15:03.803 --> 15:05.905
- I was just saying, no--

15:05.973 --> 15:07.941
In general, the streets,
 not, not-- I mean--

15:08.008 --> 15:10.810
Yeah, I'm a student.
 These two are getting their
 nursing licenses.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.512
- Exactly.
 - What street?

15:15.648 --> 15:18.018
I'm-- I'm sorry.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.020
Um, I've offended you
 and I'm sorry.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.454
- C on permiso.
- Yeah.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.523
- Yeah. Bye.
 - Good luck.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.958
How rude.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.394
- Pobrecita.
- The streets.
Like, really?

16:02.829 --> 16:03.696
Oh!

16:10.703 --> 16:12.572
Fuck a fucking duck.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.824
- So--
 - So that sounds--
 it's a trick thing.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.226
I play a mind trick
on your brain.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.461
Excuse me.
 Excuse me.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.595
I need to--
 I need to--

16:35.662 --> 16:36.996
Damn, what happened
 to your shoe?

16:37.064 --> 16:37.997
I, uh, I broke my shoe.
I need to see--

16:38.065 --> 16:39.232
I broke my shoe.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.701
Um, do you have this in,
like, a 12 and a half D?

16:41.768 --> 16:42.969
The biggest size
 we have is 11.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.737
- Okay.
- So--

16:44.804 --> 16:47.140
Um, do you have
 some duct tape?
 Maybe I could do--

16:47.207 --> 16:48.675
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.443
Definitely don't have
 no duct tape, um,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.445
but we may have
 some Scotch tape.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.481
Um, is there some
 Crazy Glue?
 'Cause that might work.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.249
That's not gonna work.
 I got you--

16:56.316 --> 16:59.519
Last thing you want to do,
you do not want Crazy Glue.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.653
Once that Crazy Glue
 opens up,

17:00.720 --> 17:02.489
it's gonna get on
 your finger,

17:02.555 --> 17:04.457
and your finger gonna get
 stuck together like this.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.792
Then you're walkin' around
 saying A-Ok all damn day.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.194
But everything's
 not okay.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.130
People think it's cool.
It's not cool.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.898
Go get the Scotch tape,
 dog. Help me out.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.300
- Thank you.
 - Hold on one second,
 we'll figure it out.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.636
- This--
 - I'm gonna be honest,

17:16.703 --> 17:18.271
I'm gonna tell you
 somethin' right now.
 This ain't gonna work.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.107
Hey, will you
 stop talkin'?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.575
If you don't use your teeth,
 it's not gonna come off.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.976
I'm not gonna use my teeth,
 I got the...

17:24.042 --> 17:25.712
lesbian manicure
 over here.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.714
- You're not
helpin' me, dude.
- How am I-- How am I--

17:27.780 --> 17:29.849
- Okay, there you go.
 There you go.
 - There it is.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.484
- Work, dog.
- Thank you, thank you.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.519
- You got it.
 - Look at it.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.721
- Ahh.
 - Boom. Bam.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.688
- Look at that, look at that.
 - You guys are great.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.090
- Thank you so much.
 - Okay.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.292
- Got you, man.
All right.
- Thank you.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.393
You have a good day.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.138
- Hi.
 How can I help you?

17:51.204 --> 17:53.740
- Yeah, we'll have
 red beans and rice.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.509
- Homemade fries.
- Homemade fries.
All right.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.811
- And a small Coke.
 - And a small Coke.
 Okay, great.

17:58.878 --> 17:59.946
That'll be $7.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.317
- Okay.
 - I'll give you
 your number.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.353
- All right, right on.
 Thank you.
 - All right, great.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.188
Hi. How can I help you?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.224
Chicken tenders meal,
 uh-huh.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.327
Biscuit and
 a small drink.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.662
What kind of drink
 you want?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.730
Pepsi, okay.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.133
You'll be number two.
 Let's get a name so
 I'll call your number.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.334
Okay? All right.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.045
And that'll just be $2.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.148
- Oh.
 - Okay.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.250
Hi. How can I
 help you?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.352
You want a pudding?
All right. They're making--

18:39.419 --> 18:42.255
Oh, shit.
 Oh, shit.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.524
Um, you know what?

18:44.591 --> 18:47.360
I think I forgot--
 I don't have my purse.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.596
I don't have my purse.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.233
I don't have my purse.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.901
Forgive me,
 I was just, uh--

18:54.967 --> 18:57.370
I needed to replenish
 my electrolytes and--

18:59.472 --> 19:00.540
But I think I know
 where it is.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.141
I think I left it
 at the, uh--

19:02.209 --> 19:03.510
I left it at the clinic.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.545
I'll just go and
 get it and, uh--

19:05.612 --> 19:07.013
And I'll just retrieve it
 and I'll--

19:07.079 --> 19:08.515
I'll pay you your money.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.716
That's no problem.
Yeah, just leave the drink,

19:09.782 --> 19:10.717
and I'll just
 hold it for you.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.319
That's not
 a big deal at all.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.320
When I come back,
 of course, I will--

19:13.386 --> 19:15.021
I'll give you
 a healthy tip.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.524
Yeah, but listen,
you don't gotta give me
no tip.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.426
It's totally fine,
 it's just that

19:19.492 --> 19:20.793
when I close out
 I have to zero out

19:20.860 --> 19:22.729
my goods in
 with my cash out,

19:22.795 --> 19:23.630
- and if it doesn't
 match up--
 - Elizah!

19:23.696 --> 19:25.465
- Elizah!
 - Excuse me!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.200
- Elizah!
 - So now you just
 gonna walk away?

19:27.267 --> 19:30.136
- What the hell?
- Hi. It's me.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.938
It's me!
It's Maura.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.706
Don't--
 You're fine,
 it's fine.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.542
It's me, it's Maura.
 Don't be scared.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.544
It's me from--
 from the phone.
 You remember me?

19:37.610 --> 19:38.511
I thought those calls
 were anonymous.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.347
They are anonymous,
but I--

19:40.413 --> 19:41.948
I was really worried
 about you. Okay?
 You all right?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.483
- You steal that Gatorade?
 - What?

19:43.550 --> 19:44.717
- Say yes.
- Did you steal
that Gatorade?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.419
No, I didn't steal
 any Gatorade.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.388
You know you stole it.
 And you drank it.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.357
I didn't steal anything.
 I told you very clearly,
 ma'am,

19:50.423 --> 19:51.991
- that I told you that I
 lost my purse and I was--
 - Okay, so--

19:52.058 --> 19:53.993
I'm gonna get you your money,
 I told you that.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.563
I don't care about the money,
 it's about the principle.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.030
You walk up in my store
 and you take shit because
 you think it's yours.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.866
- No. No! You know what--
 - Come here.

19:59.932 --> 20:02.735
- Can you loan me $2?
 - Call the police on him.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.037
- I didn't have a purse.
 - You need to come with me
 and exit the premises.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.440
Wait a minute, hold on,
I'm not a criminal.
You don't have to--

20:07.507 --> 20:09.276
- You are a criminal because
 you stole that Gatorade.
 - I have to talk to my friend.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.378
- Do you need me to call
the police on this man?
- Hold on, hold on.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.945
- Just hold on.
 - Is he bothering you?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.782
Hey, it's not he.
 Does she look like
 a he to you?

20:15.848 --> 20:19.051
The fumes coming from this
 manicure establishment,

20:19.118 --> 20:21.821
they-- they're strong.
They're too strong for
an indoor environment.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.224
So this is clearly
environmentally wrong.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.694
- Call the police on him.
 - Oh, whoa, whoa.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.796
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Hold on.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.564
You all right?

20:31.631 --> 20:33.366
- Did you call 9-1-1?

20:44.444 --> 20:45.478
- Gurney comin' through.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.447
Whenever you're ready.
 Okay?

20:47.514 --> 20:48.948
- Here we go.
- Take it easy.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.483
- Go slow.
 - On three, okay?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.690
Gurney comin' through.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.495
What's wrong with me?

21:04.464 --> 21:05.665
- Just relax now, ma'am.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.738
- What are we doing?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.105
- I think we're
 looking at a 51-50.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.841
- Seems that way.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.709
County's asked us to stop
 bringing in 51-50s.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.579
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you taking me?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.814
- We have to take you
 to the closest hospital,
 that's county.

21:21.881 --> 21:25.117
Oh, no, no. No,
 you can't take me to county.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.619
- Ma'am, just relax now.
 - No, no, please.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.120
You have to take me
 to Cedars-Sinai.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.156
- It'll be just fine.
 - No, I'm Jewish.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.257
- Please take me to Cedars.
 - It doesn't matter.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.092
All right?

21:33.159 --> 21:34.827
- It'll be fine.
 We have good doctors there.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.630
I-- My name is Pfefferman.
 You understand?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.532
- Pfefferman.
- You'll be fine.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.543
- You're waiting for
 a miracle.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.713
You're waiting for
 the sea to part.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.648
Well, that's an old miracle.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.356
So what about this.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.892
What if the miracle was you?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.995
What if you had to be
 your own Messiah?

22:09.061 --> 22:11.163
Then what?
