WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:06.199
MAN:
I have been sober for two years,
seven months, and 13 days now.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.800
I could... give you
how many hours in seconds,

00:08.840 --> 00:11.536
but then you might think
I'm obsessive. (chuckles)

00:11.570 --> 00:13.674
I guess I just want to say...

00:13.710 --> 00:15.405
thank you.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.078
Uh, without these meetings,

00:17.110 --> 00:19.442
without the support
of people like you,

00:19.480 --> 00:21.368
I just don't know where I'd be.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.638
(people clapping)

00:27.320 --> 00:28.514
MODERATOR:
Thanks, Eric.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.425
Hey.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.257
You okay?

00:32.300 --> 00:34.052
MODERATOR:
All right, we're gonna
wrap things up now.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.294
Uh, tomorrow's meeting...

00:35.330 --> 00:36.558
Sherlock...
Amygdala!

00:36.600 --> 00:39.068
(clears throat)

00:39.100 --> 00:40.328
(smacks lips)

00:41.570 --> 00:43.265
Mm, 6:00.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.709
Excellent.

00:47.410 --> 00:49.571
WATSON:
What do you mean

00:49.610 --> 00:52.215
you put yourself
in a trance?
Hypnotize myself.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.376
Simple, really.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.739
The key is
word repetition.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.748
My word, as you
may have guessed,

00:56.790 --> 00:58.314
is "amygdala."

00:58.350 --> 00:59.817
So you hypnotized yourself

00:59.860 --> 01:01.748
at your first group
support meeting?

01:01.790 --> 01:04.429
Couldn't listen to all those
sob stories, now, could I?

01:04.460 --> 01:06.325
That's the whole point.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.419
And, you know, when
you feel comfortable,
you can share.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.428
You've lived with me
a week now, Watson.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.097
You know I don't share.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.664
Well, then why
can't you listen?

01:13.700 --> 01:15.429
Attic Theory.

01:15.470 --> 01:18.439
I've always believed the human
brain is like... an attic.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.472
A storage space for facts.

01:20.510 --> 01:22.649
But because _that
space IS fInIte,

01:22.680 --> 01:24.341
it must be filled
only with the things

01:24.380 --> 01:26.575
one needs to be the
best version of oneself.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.770
It's important, therefore,
not to have useless facts.

01:28.820 --> 01:31.482
The natterings that comprise
a typical support group meeting,

01:31.520 --> 01:33.351
for example,
crowding out

01:33.390 --> 01:34.357
useful ones.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.516
Just...

01:35.560 --> 01:37.357
Can I borrow this?

01:37.390 --> 01:39.358
WOMAN:
Hey, what are you doing?
He's nuts.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.391
Your brain, hm?

01:42.530 --> 01:45.294
Useful facts.

01:45.330 --> 01:48.333
Useful, viscous, golden.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.667
Natterings.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.540
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.784
That is not even how
the brain works...

02:03.820 --> 02:05.412
It's how my brain works.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.610
Okay, more natterings:

02:06.660 --> 02:08.753
I am going to a dinner
tonight with a friend,

02:08.790 --> 02:10.678
but I will be back
before 10:00,

02:10.730 --> 02:12.391
so I'll be there
at 8:00...

02:12.430 --> 02:14.398
Two whole hours
by my lonesome?

02:14.430 --> 02:16.489
Aren't you worried I'll go
on some sort of binge?

02:16.530 --> 02:18.498
Well, brief
stretches apart

02:18.530 --> 02:20.760
are actually a natur...
A natural progression
in our companionship.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.404
Yes, you mentioned.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.407
But just to be safe,

02:23.440 --> 02:26.432
I will be giving you a drug test
when I get home.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.644
(phone rings)

02:29.680 --> 02:31.500
Captain Gregson...

02:33.380 --> 02:35.473
How may I be of assistance?

02:35.520 --> 02:36.714
GREGSON:
Name's Casey McManus.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.809
Walked through his front door
tonight

02:38.850 --> 02:40.454
and took one right
between the eyes.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.526
Cousin's on the job.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.551
Patrolman assigned
to the 116 in Queens.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.592
That's why
I called you.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.257
Gotta have
my best guys on this.

02:48.300 --> 02:52.259
You said on the phone
he walked in on a burglar.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.439
MAN: He did.
His watch and wallet are gone.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.892
The drawers were tossed, too.

02:55.940 --> 02:56.599
The victim probably startled
the perp

02:56.640 --> 02:57.561
when he came in from the hall.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.931
Holmes, Ms. Watson,
meet Detective Bell--

02:59.980 --> 03:01.971
another one
of my best guys.

03:02.010 --> 03:04.205
Hi.
He's running point
on the case.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.411
You're the
consultant, right?

03:06.450 --> 03:07.712
I heard good things.

03:07.750 --> 03:11.516
Yeah, of course you did.
Who's he?

03:11.550 --> 03:13.711
Neighbor from across the hall.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.888
He's the one who saw the body
through the door and called 911.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.283
Captain.

03:18.330 --> 03:19.695
I'm gonna wait
in the hall.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.425
Why must you
continue to act

03:21.460 --> 03:23.360
like you've never seen
a dead body before?

03:23.400 --> 03:24.719
You were a surgeon.
You went to medical school.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.260
Surely, you worked on cadavers.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.565
Right. Because that's
exactly the same thing.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.285
(sniffing)

03:53.530 --> 03:55.657
Detective Bell!

03:58.600 --> 04:01.489
You would classify this as a
robbery-homicide, would you not?

04:01.540 --> 04:02.768
Yeah.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.038
You would be wrong.

04:04.070 --> 04:05.867
This was a robbery
& a homicide.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.332
Ampersand, not dash.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.302
There were two separate
crimes committed

04:09.350 --> 04:10.703
by two separate perpetrators.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.479
The trajectory of the bullet

04:12.520 --> 04:15.375
that killed Mr. McManus
traces back to this chair.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.581
The killer was seated
when she pulled the trigger.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.315
She?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.612
I can smell "T-Blossom" brand
deodorant on the leather.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.787
It's lady's deodorant.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.889
A woman sat here
qurte recently.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.795
None of your people,
of course.

04:27.830 --> 04:29.593
This_ is an active
crIme scene,

04:29.630 --> 04:30.995
and knowing you, Captain,
they know better.

04:31.030 --> 04:32.634
That leaves the shooter.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.568
Go on.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.398
The second crime, the robbery,
was committed by a man.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.579
A very strong man judging by

04:42.610 --> 04:44.749
the items he removed
from the apartment.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.816
How strong does
a guy have to be

04:46.850 --> 04:48.579
to steal a wallet
and a watch?

04:48.620 --> 04:50.679
You're forgetting
the armoire.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.915
Dust patterns on the wall
and the floor

04:52.960 --> 04:54.712
tell us it stood here,

04:54.760 --> 04:57.649
as do these scratches
on the floor.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.590
You're nuts.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.325
Actually, he's not.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.661
It was a very heavy piece
of furniture, that.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.997
And this building
has no elevator.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.667
Are we to suppose
that the thief got it down

05:10.710 --> 05:12.678
six flights of stairs
before the police arrived?

05:12.710 --> 05:14.837
Of course not.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.371
Yet the scratches on the floor
tell us

05:17.410 --> 05:21.346
it was dragged into
the tiled hallway.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.938
Makes me think
it never left this floor.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.389
What do you think?

05:26.420 --> 05:29.753
Yeah, thought so.
Across the hall you said?

05:29.790 --> 05:31.985
You, you can't go in there.
You need a warrant.

05:32.030 --> 05:36.524
Bureaucracy. One of the many
reasons I'm not a policeman.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.525
GREGSON:
Holmes, halt.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.406
Thief.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.658
Now all you need is your killer.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.139
Casey was already dead
when I found him.

06:26.180 --> 06:28.045
I know I should've called
the cops first,

06:28.080 --> 06:30.412
but things have been so bad
for me lately.

06:30.450 --> 06:34.056
You know, I just...
Freakin' economy, I...

06:34.090 --> 06:36.479
And that armoire
was an antique.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.725
It's worth two grand
at least.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.491
But I, I never laid
a finger on him.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.862
No, you didn't.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.859
You put a bullet
in his brain.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.902
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong, wrong!

06:50.940 --> 06:52.168
What's wrong?

06:52.210 --> 06:53.677
I'm sorry,
I don't think

06:53.710 --> 06:55.177
I could've been much
clearer earlier.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.746
There were two crimes,
two perpetrators.

06:56.780 --> 06:59.146
This guy had all
of the victim's stuff.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.569
But no gun.
Not anywhere in his apartment.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.111
I suspect the GSR test
your people performed

07:04.150 --> 07:06.118
will show that he hasn't fired
one of late.

07:06.150 --> 07:07.981
Also, he isn't wearing
any deodorant,

07:08.020 --> 07:10.079
let alone Lady's "T-Blossom."
Or hadn't you noticed?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.519
You're the only one who could
smell anything on that chair.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.619
The chair, right--
I'm glad you brought that up.

07:14.660 --> 07:17.663
If, per Detective Bell's theory,
the burglar was startled

07:17.700 --> 07:19.793
by the victim's unexpected
return, why was he sitting down?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.967
It's a curious time
to take a load off, no?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.036
You know what, Sherlock?

07:24.070 --> 07:26.538
Hey, do you mind getting me
a bag of chips?

07:26.580 --> 07:29.140
I think there's a vending
machine around the corner.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.811
(door shuts)

07:33.850 --> 07:35.647
He wasn't asked
to consult here

07:35.680 --> 07:37.580
because of his charming
personality.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.715
Was he always like this?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.955
I mean, back when you knew him
in Scotland Yard?

07:42.990 --> 07:44.252
He was a pain in the ass.

07:44.290 --> 07:48.852
But he was also
very, very good.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.959
He said when he
introduced you last week

07:51.000 --> 07:53.969
that you were
his, um, "personal valet"?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.629
That's sort of like
a butler, right?

07:57.670 --> 07:59.035
You must've been
really happy

07:59.070 --> 08:00.628
when he relocated here
in New York.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.240
Actually, he reached out to me

08:03.280 --> 08:05.271
before he left London
two weeks ago.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.915
He called you
from London?

08:07.950 --> 08:13.286
Yeah. Said he was calling
from Heathrow. Why?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.788
Excuse me.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.219
Neighbor just won't cop
to the shooting.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.965
Says he wants
a lawyer.

08:26.000 --> 08:26.967
Smart man.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.059
He didn't kill anyone.
He should get a lavwer.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.261
He's also saying that
he passed a "strange woman"

08:31.310 --> 08:33.631
on the stairwell right before
he found the victim's body.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.238
Excellent! Did he get
a good look at her?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.168
Yeah, he can describe
her to a T.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.940
Probably because she's a product
of his freakin' imagination.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.016
Obviously, he heard
Harry Potter here

08:42.050 --> 08:45.542
say something about a female
shooter back at the scene,

08:45.590 --> 08:47.182
and now he's trying to serve us
one on a platter.

08:47.220 --> 08:49.108
You need to sit him
with a sketch artist.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.650
Circulate an image
of this woman ASAP.

08:50.690 --> 08:51.918
I'm sorry. I got to ask who's
running this investigation?
You indicated

08:51.960 --> 08:53.052
this case was important
to the morale of your men.
I think

08:53.100 --> 08:54.954
this guy's gonna have us
chasing some fictional shooter.

08:55.000 --> 08:55.853
You really want to run the risk

08:55.900 --> 08:56.969
of pinning the murder
on the wrong person?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.195
Call down to headquarters
and get me a sketch artist.

08:59.230 --> 09:01.334
But, Captain...
If he's wrong,

09:01.370 --> 09:04.862
he's wrong, but I want
to know he's wrong.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.578
HOLMES:
That was impressive earlier,

09:14.620 --> 09:16.269
noticing the photograph of the
armoire at the victim's house.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.947
I didn't need it
to prove my pomt,

09:17.990 --> 09:20.015
of course, but it helped.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.584
You're welcome.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.781
Um, I've got to go
meet my friend soon.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.628
You're going to be okay
getting home by yourself?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.968
This, uh, friend
that you're meeting--

09:31.000 --> 09:34.060
when was the_ last_ time
you slept With hIm?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.931
It's quite obvious
it's a he and an ex-lover.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.699
You go out of your way
to avoid gender

09:37.740 --> 09:39.207
every time
you talk about him

09:39.240 --> 09:41.708
and you avert your gaze
every time you say "friend."

09:41.740 --> 09:43.742
As to how I know
it's not a current lover,

09:43.780 --> 09:45.145
your walk speaks
volumes.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.272
My walk?

09:46.310 --> 09:47.618
Study in Belgium showed

09:47.650 --> 09:49.140
that a woman's
recent orgasmic history

09:49.180 --> 09:51.216
can be discerned
from her gait.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.616
Yours would indicate
it's been a while.

09:55.660 --> 09:58.379
Is it sad being wrong
as often as you are right?

09:58.430 --> 09:59.283
My advice:
sleep with him.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.991
Do wonders
for your mood.

10:01.030 --> 10:03.590
(sighs)

10:07.670 --> 10:09.900
Ty, hey, sorry I'm late.
Oh, please.

10:09.940 --> 10:11.737
I'm the one who should
be apologizing.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.408
I'm the one who had
to reschedule twice.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.407
That's true.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.930
DA's keeping you busy?

10:15.980 --> 10:17.948
Ah, if I don't keep
winning cases for him,

10:17.980 --> 10:19.641
how will I ever
take his job?

10:19.680 --> 10:21.739
(laughs)
Uh, how about you?

10:21.780 --> 10:24.317
You, uh, just started
with a client last week, right?

10:24.350 --> 10:25.317
How's it going?

10:25.350 --> 10:28.649
Good, fine, great.

10:28.690 --> 10:30.658
So, what is
she-- a, uh,

10:30.690 --> 10:32.658
alcoholic, addict, both?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.294
You know I don't talk
about my clients, right?

10:35.330 --> 10:36.763
Oh, sorry.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.825
Uh, I know we're not
together anymore,

10:38.870 --> 10:40.098
but I still worry about you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.358
I'm fine.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.938
The thing is, I'm not
the only one who's worried.

10:45.970 --> 10:49.030
Oh, my God, my parents-- tell me

10:49.080 --> 10:51.139
they didn't reach out to you.
They said you're not
returning their calls.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.408
Yeah, well,
I don't need a lecture

10:52.450 --> 10:54.179
every time I speak
to them, so I...

10:54.220 --> 10:55.949
They're confused, Joan.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.811
You used to be a surgeon.
Now you babysit drug addicts.

10:57.850 --> 11:00.956
I know how much it hurt
when you lost that patient,

11:00.990 --> 11:03.356
but if you're doing all this
as some kind of penance...

11:03.390 --> 11:06.427
I am doing this because
I'm actually good at it.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.961
I don't know why that's
so hard to understand.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.446
Hey, I made coffee.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.142
Thank you.

11:27.450 --> 11:31.181
It'll be right here
when you're ready.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.394
Didn't take my advice, I see.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.819
Didn't sleep
with your ex.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.991
What are you working on?

11:46.030 --> 11:47.361
Casey McManus' preliminary
autopsy report

11:47.400 --> 11:49.061
came_in a little
while ago.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.806
Just going through some
of the particulars.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.137
I thought there was
only one particular--

11:52.170 --> 11:54.434
the, uh, gunshot wound
to the head.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.746
Victim also suffered from
endothelial corneal dystrophy.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.771
Oh, that's a gray clouding
of the cornea.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.845
That's a genetic disorder.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.482
But how is that relevant?

12:04.520 --> 12:05.748
How is it not?

12:08.520 --> 12:11.887
Um, can we talk
about Captain Gregson?

12:11.930 --> 12:15.058
He's married, I'm afraid,
quite happily.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.249
(sniffs)

12:16.300 --> 12:17.426
You're funny.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.926
I was talking to him
the other night,

12:18.970 --> 12:21.768
and I wanted to know
why you didn't tell him

12:21.800 --> 12:23.336
where you were
the last six months.

12:23.370 --> 12:25.463
He said you called him
from Heathrow ten days ago

12:25.510 --> 12:26.909
when I know for a fact

12:26.940 --> 12:28.532
that you were in rehab
still in New York.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.548
You're a highly decorated
New York City Police captain.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.377
Would you allow a
recovering drug addict

12:32.410 --> 12:34.048
access to sensitive cases?
I'm not saying that...

12:34.080 --> 12:35.775
I can help him, but
only if he lets me.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.344
Okay, you're not under...
Telling him would be

12:37.390 --> 12:39.017
_ a violation of our
client-companion prIVIlege.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.119
I could sue.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.154
I am not going to tell him
anything, obviously.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.050
I just think it's sad
that you can't be honest

12:47.100 --> 12:48.795
with a man who,
as far as I can tell,

12:48.830 --> 12:49.967
is the closest thing
you have to a friend.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.935
(phone ringing)
That's all.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.289
Sherlock Holmes.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.035
Yeah, it's Bell.

12:56.070 --> 12:57.799
The captain gave me
your number.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.808
Look, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

12:59.840 --> 13:01.376
but I found the woman
from the sketch

13:01.410 --> 13:03.446
that was generated
last night.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.108
The one the neighbor saw leaving
Casey McManus' apartment?

13:06.150 --> 13:07.845
Yeah, look, how fast can you get

13:07.880 --> 13:11.384
to St. Isidora Hospital
on East 93rd?

13:11.420 --> 13:14.014
(siren chirps)

13:14.060 --> 13:15.584
I assume you already
got one of these?

13:15.620 --> 13:18.521
Yeah, dark hair, mid-30$,
approximately 5'4".

13:18.560 --> 13:20.027
Captain Gregson e-mailed me.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.823
Where is she?
I'm getting to that.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.498
First I'm gonna tell
you how I got here.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.589
I was about to put the
sketch out wide last night

13:25.630 --> 13:27.188
when one of my old
uni buddies said

13:27.240 --> 13:28.468
Sketch Girl
looked familiar.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.296
Well, he gave me a name,

13:29.340 --> 13:31.501
and the name got me
to a photograph.

13:31.540 --> 13:33.872
Yvette Ellison--
dark hair,

13:33.910 --> 13:36.071
mid-305.

13:36.110 --> 13:38.840
I slipped her picture into a
photo array for the neighbor,

13:38.880 --> 13:40.211
and he picked it out...
right away.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.219
He said, and I quote,
"There was no doubt about it."

13:43.250 --> 13:46.014
This was the girl he saw
on the stairs last night.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.314
Are you going to make me guess
where she is, Detective,

13:48.360 --> 13:49.588
or are you going
to show me?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.487
I'm gonna show you.

13:52.530 --> 13:56.864
Mr. Holmes, Ms. Watson,
meet Yvette Ellison.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.869
She tried to kill herself
three days ago.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.494
Chased a vial of sleeping pills
with a bottle of vodka.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.633
My buddy was on the scene when
the paramedics took her away,

14:04.670 --> 14:06.433
which is why
he recognized her.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.529
She's been in a coma ever since.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.275
Three days ago?

14:10.310 --> 14:11.971
Yeah, the neighbor lied.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.012
Made up a description
and then ID'd

14:14.050 --> 14:16.075
one of the only people
in the city we know

14:16.120 --> 14:18.509
couldn't have killed
Casey McManus last night,

14:18.550 --> 14:22.452
so thanks
for the, uh, consultation,

14:22.490 --> 14:23.889
but I think I'll take it

14:23.930 --> 14:25.921
from here.

14:31.930 --> 14:32.669
WATSON:
So Detective Bell
was right.

14:32.700 --> 14:33.667
Is it such
a big...?

14:33.700 --> 14:35.565
Shh.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.635
Yvette!

14:36.670 --> 14:38.558
What is wrong
with you?

14:38.610 --> 14:41.272
Closed eyes do not
necessarily a coma make.

14:41.310 --> 14:42.277
You think
she's faking?

14:42.310 --> 14:44.107
(sniffs)

14:44.150 --> 14:45.174
It's T-Blossom deodorant--

14:45.210 --> 14:47.019
_ the same
as in the crime scene.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.985
What are you doing?

14:50.020 --> 14:50.987
Looking for a syringe.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.987
What for?

14:52.020 --> 14:53.612
I'm going to stab it

14:53.660 --> 14:55.651
into the softest part
of Ms. Ellison's thigh.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.282
Lots of nerve endings there--

14:57.330 --> 14:58.649
no one can fake their way
through that.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.920
If you wanted to know

15:00.960 --> 15:02.188
if she was really in a coma,

15:02.230 --> 15:04.323
all you had to do was ask.

15:08.570 --> 15:11.266
That's okay, but I can't
stab her in the thigh?

15:11.310 --> 15:12.607
It's a test for pseudocoma.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.607
When the patient's
hand is released

15:13.640 --> 15:14.971
directly above the face,

15:17.410 --> 15:19.401
Easy to fake.

15:19.450 --> 15:20.678
Yeah, well,

15:20.720 --> 15:23.541
respiration and pupillary
response aren't,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.581
and hers_are consistent with
a patient in a comatose state.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.657
Her coma is real.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.328
She didn't kill
that man last night.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.327
(door opens)

15:31.360 --> 15:33.419
Can I help you?

15:33.460 --> 15:34.722
Your patient?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.728
She is.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.036
Her coma is quite real.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.574
WATSON:
That was a dead end.

15:49.610 --> 15:51.248
Actually it wasn't.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.977
Detective Bell found the right
face, but the wrong girl.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.079
There was a book on
Yvette's nightstand.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.519
Obviously someone's
been reading it to her.

15:58.550 --> 16:00.757
The inscription on
the inside cover said,

16:00.790 --> 16:03.623
"To Yvette and Rebecca
on your fifth birthday."

16:03.660 --> 16:06.458
"Your fifth birthday," as in
the birthday you both share.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.660
Yvette has a twin.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.395
Yvette and Rebecca Ellison
were the only children

16:12.430 --> 16:14.694
of Charles Ellison,
who died several months ago.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.231
Charles Ellison-- why does
that name sound familiar?

16:17.270 --> 16:19.238
Shipping magnate,
multimillionaire.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.329
Two parks and a school
named after him.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.733
According to this,
Rebecca has run

16:22.780 --> 16:25.408
the family's charitable
trust for years.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.008
(elevator bell dings)

16:27.050 --> 16:29.769
So you think
Casey McManus' neighbor

16:29.820 --> 16:31.640
didn't see Yvette last night,
but her sister?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.282
I daresay
you're getting the hang

16:33.320 --> 16:36.255
of deductive reasoning,
Watson.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.429
Excuse me,

16:38.460 --> 16:40.724
could you point us in the
direction of Rebecca Ellison?

16:40.760 --> 16:44.389
I'm Rebecca Ellison.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.365
Uh, she has dark hair,
brown eyes, freckles.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.665
I'm sorry. I think
you might be confusing me

16:50.710 --> 16:52.564
with my sister Yvette.

16:52.610 --> 16:56.239
We're fraternal twins,
not identical.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.645
She's, um,
she's not well right now.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.476
She's in the hospital.

16:58.510 --> 17:00.671
Is there something
I can help you with?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.780
We're good. Thanks.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.398
Having fun?

17:14.430 --> 17:17.297
Can't you tell?

17:17.330 --> 17:19.798
You're still thinking
about the case.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.799
Obviously Yvette Ellison
didn't kill Casey McManus,

17:22.840 --> 17:24.239
but given that his
neighbor picked her

17:24.270 --> 17:25.669
out of a photo array,

17:25.710 --> 17:27.075
it stands to reason
that the real killer

17:27.110 --> 17:28.634
bears a striking resemblance.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.377
The question is: who is she and
what did she have against Casey?

17:32.410 --> 17:34.719
Well, is it possible
that Detective Bell was right

17:34.750 --> 17:36.718
and that the neighbor was lying
about seeing the woman

17:40.120 --> 17:42.213
Hey, I found something in
the hall closet the other day.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.727
Was it the zipper mask?

17:43.760 --> 17:46.422
'Cause I swear I'm just
holding that for a friend.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.597
It's a trophy from an old case.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.722
Forgot I still had it.

17:52.770 --> 17:53.862
Feel free to bin it.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.663
Uh, I-I know it's yours

17:55.700 --> 17:57.736
because it has "S. Holmes"
engraved under the strings.

17:57.770 --> 17:59.863
So I used to play.
What of it?

17:59.910 --> 18:01.571
Well, I just thought
it might be a nice addition

18:01.610 --> 18:03.601
to your post-rehab
regimen.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.743
Playing an instrument can
relieve a lot of stress.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.645
You think I'm stressed?

18:07.680 --> 18:11.684
I think... you have
a lot on your plate

18:11.720 --> 18:13.756
and you're not going
easy on yourself

18:13.790 --> 18:15.781
with all this work
with the police.

18:15.820 --> 18:16.787
I don't play anymore.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.754
Attic theory.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.599
Playing took up too much space
in my brain, so I stopped.

18:20.630 --> 18:21.824
That doesn't even
make any sense.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.828
You can't unlearn something
you already know.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.792
(phone ringing)

18:25.830 --> 18:28.390
Five bucks says
it's the ex-boyfriend.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.503
Answer it.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.837
I'm not going anywhere.

18:31.870 --> 18:35.328
(ringing continues)

18:37.880 --> 18:38.904
Bad time?

18:38.950 --> 18:40.372
Uh, not great.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.819
Is everything okay?

18:41.850 --> 18:44.216
Um, what's up?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.639
I just left work and wanted
to see how you were doing.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.385
I'm fine.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.479
But you said
it wasn't a good time.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.522
Well, I'm just kind of
in the middle of,

18:53.560 --> 18:55.926
you know, something... What...

18:55.960 --> 18:57.791
Oh, my God. What the hell?

18:57.830 --> 18:59.320
Joan?

18:59.370 --> 19:01.463
What is it?
Is everything okay?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.400
Uh, Ty, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.702
You were right about
the stress relief.

19:04.740 --> 19:05.866
I felt like Jimi Hendrix

19:05.910 --> 19:07.275
for a second there.

19:07.310 --> 19:08.868
You didn't have to do that.

19:08.910 --> 19:10.377
Thank you, funny name that.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.901
Noun, verb, nationality.
Stop changing subjects.

19:12.950 --> 19:15.441
Stop mucking with my things.
I wouldn't have to muck
with your things if you would

19:15.480 --> 19:17.948
open up to me. We're supposed
to learn about each other.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.787
(phone ringing)
That's how
companionship works.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.754
Good evening, Captain.

19:23.790 --> 19:24.779
How may I help?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.457
Uh, you can meet me in Queens.

19:26.490 --> 19:28.822
There's been
another shooting death.

19:28.860 --> 19:32.660
Looks like the same gun
that killed Casey McManus.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.191
Well,
given Casey McManus' neighbor

19:35.240 --> 19:36.935
has been in custody
since last night,

19:36.970 --> 19:39.200
I'd say that officially
clears him of the murder,

19:39.240 --> 19:40.935
wouldn't you?
Well, I'm big enough

19:40.980 --> 19:42.675
to admit when I'm wrong.
Doesn't mean he didn't lie

19:42.710 --> 19:44.246
about the neighbor
he claimed to see.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.872
Shooter was seated again.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.468
Any thoughts to why?

19:51.320 --> 19:52.947
(sniffs)

19:52.990 --> 19:55.584
I smell the same deodorant
I smelled at the first scene.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.656
So we know what our killer
smells like.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.488
Too bad we can't put out an APB
on an armpit.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.952
WATSON:
Sherlock?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.262
You said
the first victim suffered

20:03.300 --> 20:05.325
from corneal dystrophy,
didn't you?

20:05.370 --> 20:06.598
What of it?

20:06.630 --> 20:09.337
This medicine
is used to treat it.

20:09.370 --> 20:11.258
News trucks are here.
Perfect.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.676
You want to tell them
we got two Victims

20:13.710 --> 20:14.779
with no discernible link

20:14.810 --> 20:16.277
or should I?

20:16.310 --> 20:19.199
Actually, Captain,
the link is quite discernible.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.316
Both victims suffered
from the same

20:23.350 --> 20:25.284
rare genetic disorder:

20:25.320 --> 20:26.685
clouding of the corneas.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.017
If you ignore skin color
for the moment,

20:28.060 --> 20:29.948
you note the, uh,

20:29.990 --> 20:31.924
the widow's peak,
the bone structure of the face.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.349
You tell me they don't look
the least bit familiar.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.518
Casey McManus and this woman
were more than just linked.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.834
They were brother and sister.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.543
You were right about
the two victims being related.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.707
DNA test showed that
they were half-siblings.

20:52.750 --> 20:53.978
Uh, for what it's worth,

20:54.020 --> 20:56.580
the genetic traits here
suggest that

20:56.620 --> 20:58.485
the parent they had in common
was the father.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.385
Yeah, our ME said
the same thing,

21:00.420 --> 21:01.819
but according to interviews

21:01.860 --> 21:03.623
with the friends
and family members,

21:03.660 --> 21:05.287
neither knew
the other one existed.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.390
Casey McManus' mom
had him out of wedlock.

21:08.430 --> 21:10.489
She never told him
who his real dad was.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.827
Ditto for Anna Webster.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.065
Far as they knew,

21:14.100 --> 21:15.738
they were only children.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.328
Both shared a mystery dad.

21:17.370 --> 21:19.031
Both were murdered
within a day of each other.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.674
Obviously not a coincidence.

21:20.710 --> 21:21.972
Do you think maybe

21:22.010 --> 21:23.739
he was the one
who killlled them?
0.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.338
I still think
the killer's a woman.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.745
But identifying dad

21:26.780 --> 21:28.611
might get us closer
to identifying her.

21:28.650 --> 21:29.810
Surely the victims' mothers

21:29.850 --> 21:30.987
can help on that front.

21:31.020 --> 21:32.442
Yeah, you'd think.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.811
Casey's mom died
in a car accident in '97.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.522
Anna Webster's died
of cancer, 2008.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.028
Neither are talking to anybody.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.527
Just found this.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.597
Anna Webster filed a complaint
a few weeks ago

21:44.630 --> 21:46.791
about a guy she thought
was following her.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.639
Saw him parked outside
her home one morning

21:48.670 --> 21:50.661
and snapped a few pictures
from her window.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.507
Now, I'm thinking

21:52.540 --> 21:53.973
maybe that's the father
we're trying to find.

21:54.010 --> 21:56.001
The age is right.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.349
But there's approximately...

21:58.380 --> 22:00.848
zero family resemblance.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.848
Not dad, not by a long shot.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.019
I'm pretty sure Holmes
is right on this one.

22:05.050 --> 22:06.517
How?

22:06.550 --> 22:10.987
Because believe it or
not, I know this guy.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.679
(tapping on window)

22:12.730 --> 22:14.857
Tommy Gregson,
as I live and breathe!

22:14.900 --> 22:16.356
Ha-ha! How long
has it been, Mike,

22:16.400 --> 22:18.129
four or
five years?
Hey, Mike, how you been?

22:18.170 --> 22:21.037
Eh, take a long around;
you tell me.
Mike and I

22:21.070 --> 22:22.059
came up together
in the department.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.761
Then he got
all high and mighty.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.903
He started working
for the private sector.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.737
Became top investigator for
White Shoe & White Shoe here.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.101
Mike, this is
Detective Bell,

22:30.140 --> 22:31.539
Ms. Watson,
and Mr. Holmes.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.104
MIKE: Yeah,
any of you thirsty?

22:33.150 --> 22:34.447
My girl makes
a killer espresso.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.038
No, actually, we're
sort of on a clock.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.980
We were hoping that

22:38.020 --> 22:39.544
you were able
to tell us why you

22:39.590 --> 22:41.808
were trailing this girl
two weeks ago.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.782
Uh...

22:43.830 --> 22:46.025
I haven't seen her before
in my life.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.522
Mike.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.895
Um, can't talk about it.

22:52.930 --> 22:56.661
It has to do with a case
for one of my firm's clients.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.964
It's protected
by privilege.
Mike,

22:59.010 --> 23:01.979
this girl got killed
last night.
I know.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.739
I saw it on the news
and I think it stinks,

23:03.780 --> 23:05.543
and she seemed like a good kid,

23:05.580 --> 23:08.174
but you know how it is:
rules are rules.
Mike...

23:08.220 --> 23:09.642
Excuse me.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.409
Sorry, could you just--
excuse me a second--

23:11.450 --> 23:13.884
would you mind just telling me
a little bit more

23:13.920 --> 23:16.081
about this
beautiful plant.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.826
You work a lot of
late nights, Mr. McGee.

23:17.860 --> 23:20.420
I can tell by your eyes, but
you know what else I can tell

23:20.460 --> 23:21.825
is that you've turned
to methamphetamines

23:21.860 --> 23:23.191
to stay awake and alert.

23:23.230 --> 23:25.164
You blink excessively.
Your eyes dart.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.589
You also lost a
great deal of weight

23:27.640 --> 23:28.937
over the last few
months, even though

23:28.970 --> 23:30.096
your diet's as
revolting as ever.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.869
And the fact that your
carotid has started

23:31.910 --> 23:33.605
jumping up and down
like a basketball

23:33.640 --> 23:35.574
makes me think that
your stash is nearby.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.168
It's in your desk, perhaps?

23:37.210 --> 23:39.075
Tell us what we need
to know right now,

23:39.110 --> 23:41.078
and I won't start
throwmg your drawers open

23:41.120 --> 23:45.545
in front of Captain Gregson
and Detecti Bell.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.115
Also, um...

23:48.160 --> 23:51.687
when you're ready to get
your life back on track...

23:51.730 --> 23:53.789
Hemdale Rehabilitation Facility

23:53.830 --> 23:56.219
gets my very strongest
recommendation.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.899
Uh, they even have a pool.

23:58.930 --> 24:00.124
Yeah.

24:02.770 --> 24:06.103
Uh, Tommy, uh...
since you and I

24:06.140 --> 24:07.869
go back a ways,

24:07.910 --> 24:09.935
I'm gonna

24:09.980 --> 24:12.904
take this file
and put it on my desk.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.512
I'm gonna go

24:15.550 --> 24:16.710
hit the head.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.116
You know, whatever
happens in here

24:19.150 --> 24:21.983
while I'm gone,
you know... happens.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.124
Appreciate it, Mike.
Yeah. Sure, Tommy.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.151
Sure.

24:32.830 --> 24:35.833
(horns honk in distance)

24:39.170 --> 24:40.808
Casey McManus

24:40.840 --> 24:42.899
and Anna Webster,

24:42.940 --> 24:44.805
you hired your lawyers
to investigate them

24:44.850 --> 24:46.147
several months ago-- why?

24:46.180 --> 24:48.171
Because
you discovered

24:48.220 --> 24:50.643
that Casey and Anna
were your half-siblings.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.817
Your father Charles,
as successful a businessman

24:52.850 --> 24:54.886
as he was potent a philanderer,

24:54.920 --> 24:57.525
sired them out of wedlock
decades ago.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.652
Paid off their mothers
to keep them quiet.

24:58.690 --> 24:59.827
He told you and Yvette

24:59.860 --> 25:01.191
of their existence
on his deathbed.

25:01.230 --> 25:02.595
Now they're both dead.

25:02.630 --> 25:03.961
Coincidence?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.524
I suspect not.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.889
What are you talking about?

25:06.930 --> 25:08.989
What do you mean,
they're both dead?

25:09.040 --> 25:10.564
What he means, Ms. Ellison,
is that you don't

25:10.610 --> 25:12.999
have to worry about them
coming after your money anymore.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.179
HOLMES:
We know that Charles
left his fortune

25:15.210 --> 25:17.906
to you and Yvette, but he failed
to include language in his will

25:17.950 --> 25:19.303
that would exclude
his bastard children

25:19.350 --> 25:20.977
from laying claim
to their share of it.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.214
That made them
pretermitted heirs

25:25.150 --> 25:27.084
if they ever discovered
their father's true identity,

25:27.120 --> 25:28.610
they'd have been able to sue

25:28.660 --> 25:30.309
for a piece
of his considerable estate,

25:30.360 --> 25:32.328
potentially reducing you
and your sister's inheritance

25:32.360 --> 25:34.294
by as much as two-thirds.

25:34.330 --> 25:37.151
That's why you hired your
lawyers to investigate them,

25:37.200 --> 25:38.269
and that's why

25:38.300 --> 25:40.939
I believe you killed them.

25:40.970 --> 25:42.631
I didn't kill anyone.
Can you account

25:42.670 --> 25:44.035
for your whereabouts
the last two nights

25:44.070 --> 25:45.628
between the hours
of 8:00 pm.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.830
and 10:00 pm?

25:46.870 --> 25:48.679
H was... at home.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.109
I was alone.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.346
(whispers):
That means no.

25:51.380 --> 25:52.642
Maybe it's time

25:52.680 --> 25:54.318
we took this
back to the precinct.

25:54.350 --> 25:56.215
REBECCA:
No.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.047
No.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.584
Look, you're right about my dad.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.359
He did tell me and my sister

26:07.390 --> 26:09.699
about Casey and Anna
right before he died.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.266
And yes, we knew
they could lay claim

26:11.300 --> 26:13.188
to at least part of the estate.

26:13.230 --> 26:14.891
It was very difficult for us.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.033
We were very angry with him;
we couldn't believe

26:17.070 --> 26:18.935
he would keep something
like that from us.

26:18.970 --> 26:21.370
But he was very sick, and we...

26:21.410 --> 26:23.037
(sighs)

26:23.080 --> 26:26.049
After he died,
we went back and forth

26:26.080 --> 26:27.616
about what we should do.

26:27.650 --> 26:28.719
Neither of us wanted to have

26:28.750 --> 26:29.614
to keep his secret,

26:29.650 --> 26:31.288
but to give tens of millions

26:31.320 --> 26:35.051
_ of dollars to two _
Virtual strangers seemed insane.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.729
That's why we reached
out to his attorneys.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.284
We wanted them to look
into Casey and Anna

26:39.330 --> 26:42.049
so we could have
all the facts at our disposal.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.318
Where they lived, perhaps;
how one might get
into their homes.

26:44.370 --> 26:45.792
No. Nothing like that.

26:45.830 --> 26:48.094
We just wanted to know
what kind of people

26:48.140 --> 26:49.892
they were.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.261
But then, before we could
make any sort of decision...

26:52.310 --> 26:54.631
Yvette went into a tailspin.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.649
She... started seeing
a married man,

26:57.680 --> 26:59.409
started drinking.

26:59.450 --> 27:02.078
And then she tried
to kill herself.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.247
The "suicide attempt," right,

27:04.290 --> 27:07.043
'cause I'm starting to wonder
if that's what that really was.

27:07.090 --> 27:09.285
I have to assume that
with Yvette out of the way,

27:09.320 --> 27:11.982
you stood to inherit the Ellison
fortune in its entirety.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.396
It wouldn't surprise
me to learn that

27:14.430 --> 27:17.228
you found some way to compel
her to take those pills.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.660
I would never hurt my sister.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.167
BELL:
Ms. Ellison,

27:23.200 --> 27:25.100
if you'll come with us...

27:25.140 --> 27:28.268
HOLMES:
Just one thing.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.403
Why disguise yourself as Yvette
to commit the murders?

27:30.440 --> 27:32.408
The witness saw you
at the first scene,

27:32.450 --> 27:34.771
but he described
your Sister to a T.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.072
I-I know that you're
a fraternal twin,

27:37.120 --> 27:38.417
but with a wig, bit of a makeup,

27:38.450 --> 27:40.008
you bear more than
a passing resemblance.

27:40.050 --> 27:41.415
The question is,
why would you want to?

27:41.460 --> 27:43.280
What was the point
of trying to frame

27:43.320 --> 27:44.924
a woman in a coma?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.222
You even put on her deodorant.

27:46.260 --> 27:48.353
Master stroke,
when you think about it.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.220
You're insane.

27:59.370 --> 28:01.429
(horn beeping nearby)

28:01.480 --> 28:03.436
She really got you, huh?

28:03.480 --> 28:06.278
Lefty. Caught me by surprise.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.471
This one, leathery from slaps.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.374
This one, baby's bottom.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.449
Ty, what the hell
are you doing here?

28:19.490 --> 28:21.799
What do you mean, what
the hell am I doing here?

28:21.830 --> 28:23.457
Dinner, remember?
You said 6:00.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.025
I didn't say anything. How
did you even find this place?

28:26.070 --> 28:27.389
Your e-mail-- you said
your friend's having

28:27.430 --> 28:28.795
a dinner party,
I should come.
Ty!

28:28.840 --> 28:30.193
Such a pleasure.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.128
Joan's told me
so little about you.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.307
You hacked my e-mail?

28:34.510 --> 28:35.477
Joan, what's going on?

28:35.510 --> 28:36.477
What does it look like, Ty?

28:36.510 --> 28:37.477
It's a soiree.

28:37.510 --> 28:38.875
Not sure about this, though.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.400
Bit of a party foul.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.247
Unless...
You know what?
This was a mistake.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.384
I don't understand.
Who is that guy?

28:44.420 --> 28:46.741
He's my...

28:46.790 --> 28:48.519
he's my friend,
and he's a prankster,

28:48.560 --> 28:51.051
(laughs):
and he brought you here
to mess with me.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.387
So...
He's your boyfriend.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.385
No.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.159
Wow. Uh, not even close.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.225
You know what?
I am so sorry.
I'm gonna call you

28:57.260 --> 28:59.364
tomorrow, okay?
I backed out of drinks
with the DA

28:59.400 --> 29:00.492
for this.
Tell your friend

29:00.530 --> 29:03.363
he's lucky I didn't slug him.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.930
(sighs)

29:05.970 --> 29:08.109
(quietly): If you ever do,
swing from the left.

29:08.140 --> 29:11.246
Where's he going?
Was it something I said?

29:11.280 --> 29:14.443
Invading my privacy, not okay.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.016
Said the walking, talking

29:16.050 --> 29:17.415
professional invasion
of privacy.

29:17.450 --> 29:18.986
I am here to work with you.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.544
I thought you
understood that by now.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.114
I'm sorry, wasn't it you
that said we were

29:22.160 --> 29:23.957
supposed to be learning more
about each other?

29:23.990 --> 29:25.355
That's how companionship
works, is it not?

29:25.390 --> 29:26.857
Is this because
of the violin yesterday?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.528
Because I think_
you made your pomt

29:28.560 --> 29:29.959
when you set it on fire!

29:30.000 --> 29:31.092
Well, I haven't made my point

29:31.130 --> 29:32.119
unless you've absorbed it.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.194
Friendship
is not a requirement

29:33.230 --> 29:34.788
of cohabitation.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.262
I'll keep my secrets;
you keep yours.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.961
Provided I'm still sober
in five weeks,

29:38.010 --> 29:39.409
we'll go our separate ways, hmm?

29:40.840 --> 29:43.536
(phone ringing)

29:43.580 --> 29:45.275
Holmes.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.278
It's Captain Gregson.
Just thought you should know

29:47.310 --> 29:48.470
we're letting
Rebecca Ellison go.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.976
What?

29:50.020 --> 29:52.580
Searches of
her home and business

29:52.620 --> 29:54.315
didn't turn up anything

29:54.360 --> 29:56.316
and security cameras
at her apartment

29:56.360 --> 29:59.056
confirm she was there
at the time of each murder

29:59.090 --> 30:00.819
just like she said she was.

30:00.860 --> 30:02.452
She enters before 7:00
both nights

30:02.500 --> 30:05.162
and doesn't leave
until the next morning.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.533
She didn't kill Casey McManus
or Anna Webster.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.009
You guys know being up here
is, uh, it's a big step,

30:19.050 --> 30:20.403
and part of me is...

30:20.450 --> 30:21.849
(quietly):
I can't believe

30:21.880 --> 30:23.416
that with everything
we have to do,

30:23.450 --> 30:25.839
you have dragged me to
another addict festival.

30:25.890 --> 30:28.916
We have nowhere else to be
for the next 45 minutes

30:28.960 --> 30:30.484
but here at this meeting.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.056
She tricked them.

30:32.090 --> 30:34.399
I don't know how yet,
but she tricked them.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.227
Rebecca Ellison.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.864
I still think
she's the one

30:37.900 --> 30:41.563
that murdered Casey McManus
and Anna Webster.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.161
Hmm? Would you rather I put
myself in another trance?

30:45.210 --> 30:47.565
I already thought of that.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.601
Got it off the board over there.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.107
You even think
about zoning out,

30:51.150 --> 30:53.175
it goes into the softest part
of your thigh.

30:53.210 --> 30:55.644
(whispers):
Lots of nerve endings there.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.113
You wouldn't dare.

30:57.150 --> 31:00.381
MODERATOR:
Who'd like to go next?

31:03.420 --> 31:06.127
My name is Elaine,
and I'm an addict.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.559
OTHERS:
Hi, Elaine.
(mumbles)

31:07.590 --> 31:10.195
ELAINE:
I am exactly

31:10.230 --> 31:12.596
360 days sober.

31:12.630 --> 31:15.098
Five more, and I hit
my one-year mark.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.937
I know I-I should be proud.

31:16.970 --> 31:19.609
I know I should be excited,
but I can't be.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.473
Because I'm not the only one

31:22.510 --> 31:25.172
whose life was ruined
by my addiction.

31:25.210 --> 31:26.939
My drug was...

31:26.980 --> 31:29.039
(quietly): I'm playing
the violin again.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.219
The world's smallest.

31:31.250 --> 31:33.480
Well, I thought
you'd be happy.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.586
Which is why I decided
to latch on to a doctor instead.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.026
I met this great guy,

31:43.060 --> 31:45.164
Steven, a GP,

31:45.200 --> 31:48.533
and I acted like I was
all into him, you know?

31:48.570 --> 31:50.231
He was married.

31:50.270 --> 31:52.602
He had three
beautiful daughters.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.403
But I didn't care about that.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.704
All I cared about was me
and what I needed.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.971
When we were together, it was
like I didn't even see him.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.671
All I saw were the drugs.

32:01.720 --> 32:05.713
And eventually, his wife
found out and called the police,

32:05.750 --> 32:07.957
(crying):
and...

32:07.990 --> 32:09.719
even though I was the one
who started it all,

32:09.760 --> 32:12.388
he was the one who went to jail.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.295
You see, he had taken an oath.

32:14.330 --> 32:18.494
He promised to do no harm.

32:18.530 --> 32:21.590
But what about the harm
I did to him?

32:21.640 --> 32:24.962
We have to leave.
What?

32:25.010 --> 32:26.602
You know you're required by your
father to attend these meetings.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.631
I just had a breakthrough
regarding the investigation,

32:28.680 --> 32:31.672
and you want me to sit in a room
and tell stories like a child.

32:31.710 --> 32:32.972
You don't think I know
you'd say anything

32:33.010 --> 32:34.170
to get out of these meetings?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.972
If you think these matter,

32:36.020 --> 32:37.248
then fine, tomorrow
I'll go to two, or ten,

32:37.280 --> 32:39.748
but right now I have
a killer to stop.

32:39.790 --> 32:41.587
Tell me what
your breakthrough is.
What?

32:41.620 --> 32:43.713
You said you had some sort
of breakthrough-- what is it?

32:43.760 --> 32:45.455
Now, look, there isn't
time for this!

32:45.490 --> 32:47.424
We need to find out where
Rebecca Ellison is right now.

32:47.460 --> 32:48.654
You said earlier
we don't need

32:48.700 --> 32:49.997
to be friends,
and you're right.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.691
But we do need
to trust each other.

32:51.730 --> 32:54.039
Tell me what's going on,
and I will try and help you.

32:54.070 --> 32:57.289
Don't, and I will be
the opposite of help.

32:57.340 --> 32:59.535
REBECCA:
"For I consider brains

32:59.570 --> 33:00.662
"far superior to money
in every way.

33:00.710 --> 33:03.178
You may have noticed
that if one..."

33:03.210 --> 33:04.643
Murderer!

33:04.680 --> 33:06.671
You may have
fooled the police.

33:06.710 --> 33:08.075
You didn't fool me.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.519
I know that you're the one

33:09.550 --> 33:10.744
who killed Casey McManus
and Anna Webster.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.248
Get out. Right now.
Nurse!

33:13.290 --> 33:14.780
The surveillance cameras
in your budding.

33:14.820 --> 33:17.755
The ones that support
your so-called "alibi."

33:17.790 --> 33:19.655
You tampered with them somehow.
MAN:
What's going on in here?

33:19.690 --> 33:21.555
HOLMES:
I'm on to you, Ms. Ellison.
Matter of fact,

33:21.600 --> 33:23.056
I'm way ahead of you.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.694
I know all about the third
pretermitted heir.

33:25.730 --> 33:26.697
What?
Daddy's third bastard.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.290
I figured out who she is.

33:29.340 --> 33:33.504
Mary Margaret Phelps.
80-33 West Tremont,
Morris Heights.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.508
Don't pretend like you
don't already know.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.804
You're not that good an actress.
Holmes, back away.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.705
WATSON:
When I couldn't talk you
out of coming,

33:39.750 --> 33:40.808
I texted him.
Yes, that's right.

33:40.850 --> 33:43.171
The opposite of help.
Thank you.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.744
You know what?
It doesn't matter

33:44.790 --> 33:45.779
because as of tonight,

33:45.820 --> 33:48.186
Mary Margaret has
her own personal bodyguard.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.552
Me. I'll be watching her
24/7,

33:50.590 --> 33:52.649
and I won't let you
anywhere near her.

33:52.690 --> 33:54.123
That's enough.
Get off!

33:54.160 --> 33:56.549
BELL: Okay.
(groans)

33:56.600 --> 33:58.090
That's it. Come on.

33:58.130 --> 33:59.688
You just assaulted
a police officer,

33:59.730 --> 34:02.369
which means you

34:02.400 --> 34:04.265
get to spend the night
in jail. Let's go.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.437
You haven't seen the last
of me, Ms. Ellison.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.677
Not by a long shot.

34:08.710 --> 34:10.837
I will not let you hurt
the third heir!
Excuse me.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.440
Do you understand me?
I will not let you hurt her!

34:13.480 --> 34:14.708
BELL:
Let's go.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.663
(door creaks)

35:09.770 --> 35:12.330
(lock clicks open)

35:16.180 --> 35:18.603
(beeping)

35:38.970 --> 35:41.461
Or do you prefer Yvette?

35:42.740 --> 35:44.503
REBECCA:
I don't understand.

35:44.540 --> 35:46.303
She was in a coma.

35:46.340 --> 35:47.602
Now she's fine?

35:47.640 --> 35:49.471
It wasn't a
regular coma.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.308
It was medically induced
by her doctor.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.342
He put her in and
brought her out as needed.

35:55.380 --> 35:58.281
To kill Casey and Anna.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.878
I don't understand.
Why would he...

35:59.920 --> 36:01.285
Because_he was
the married man

36:01.320 --> 36:03.459
with whom _
she was haVIng an affair.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.856
Obviously, she never
introduced you.

36:05.890 --> 36:07.949
Because he was also
part of her plan

36:07.990 --> 36:11.198
to protect her money from her
father's illegitimate children.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.926
When I met him
the other day,

36:13.970 --> 36:16.768
I noticed a pale stripe
of skin on his ﬁnger.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.360
Clearly, he'd recently stopped
wearing his wedding band.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.435
Didn't think anything
of it in the moment,

36:21.480 --> 36:22.902
but then at a, um,

36:22.940 --> 36:24.942
a gathering I attended

36:24.980 --> 36:26.948
this evening,
I heard the story

36:26.980 --> 36:28.743
of a woman
who seduced her doctor

36:28.780 --> 36:31.442
to take advantage
of his medical expertise.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.412
And it got me thinking

36:33.450 --> 36:34.917
about you and your sister's
predicament.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.225
Two heiresses learn
of the eXIstence

36:38.260 --> 36:40.251
of two half-siblings days before

36:40.290 --> 36:43.657
they're set to receive their
rather massive inheritance.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.965
One has a big heart,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.992
the other...
Hmm.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.565
Big heart wants to share.

36:52.610 --> 36:53.929
Get to know these people.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.278
Welcome them as family,

36:55.310 --> 36:57.835
and share with them
her many blessings.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.474
Little heart would
rather see them dead.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.819
Problem is she knows

37:02.850 --> 37:05.648
that only she and
one other person, her sister,

37:05.690 --> 37:07.419
have motive to kill them.

37:07.450 --> 37:08.883
She also knows that this motive,

37:08.920 --> 37:12.822
in time, could easily
be traced back to her.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.999
So what does she do?
She finds herself

37:15.030 --> 37:18.022
an alibi that is
beyond reproach.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.664
She enlists the help
of someone with the knowledge

37:19.700 --> 37:21.361
and the expertise

37:21.400 --> 37:24.267
to not only help her
stage a suicide attempt,

37:24.310 --> 37:27.006
but ease her into a coma.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.770
Yvette's_doctor was arrested
a little while ago.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.277
He confessed to giving
her barbiturates

37:31.310 --> 37:33.005
to keep her unconscious,
not only to trick

37:33.050 --> 37:34.847
the machines
that monitored her,

37:34.880 --> 37:36.609
but also anyone who would want
to examine her

37:36.650 --> 37:38.015
when he wasn't around.

37:38.050 --> 37:41.713
Hmm. It wasn't a perfect
plan, of course.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.409
Between the drugs
and the atrophied muscles,

37:43.460 --> 37:44.927
she was quite weak.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.279
That's why she was seated

37:46.330 --> 37:48.696
when she shot Casey and Anna.

37:48.730 --> 37:51.767
Because, in the moment,
it was too difficult to stand.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.633
I never told you that I wanted
to share the money

37:54.670 --> 37:56.934
and Yvette didn't.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.608
How did you know?

37:58.640 --> 38:01.006
Why else would she go
to these lengths?

38:03.080 --> 38:04.604
And what about the third heir?

38:04.650 --> 38:06.845
The one whose house
Yvette broke into.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.019
Is she okay?
She's fine.

38:09.050 --> 38:11.644
In that she never existed.

38:11.690 --> 38:12.941
I, I made her up.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.480
WATSON:
What you saw
at the hospital,

38:14.520 --> 38:15.851
none of it was real.

38:15.890 --> 38:17.380
It was a trap.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.956
I made a commotion to draw

38:18.990 --> 38:20.526
Yvette's doctor in.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.551
I announced the name and address
of the heir.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.068
Mary Margaret Phelps,
80-33 West Tremont,

38:25.100 --> 38:26.465
so that he'd have them.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.058
I then "assaulted"

38:28.100 --> 38:29.465
Detective Bell

38:29.500 --> 38:30.967
so the good doctor
would think that I,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.036
the only apparent threat
to his and Yvette's plan,

38:33.070 --> 38:35.004
was in jail for the night,
allowing them

38:35.040 --> 38:37.679
a very crucial window
of opportunity.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.371
And they took it.

38:39.410 --> 38:41.719
Because even though

38:41.750 --> 38:43.115
neither of them
had even heard

38:43.150 --> 38:44.686
of the third heir
before tonight,

38:44.720 --> 38:46.642
they couldn't
take any chances.

38:46.690 --> 38:49.079
As for the woman Yvette
trailed to her home...

38:49.120 --> 38:52.419
she's an officer here
at the precmct.

38:56.060 --> 38:59.120
I have to contact
our attorneys.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.126
I need to see if
they can help her.

39:01.170 --> 39:03.764
I know what she did

39:03.800 --> 39:05.563
is unforgivable,

39:05.610 --> 39:08.067
but she is still my sister.
There were only

39:08.110 --> 39:09.975
two pretermitted heirs,
Ms. Ellison.

39:10.010 --> 39:12.046
Yvette killed
the second one yesterday.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.968
So tell me:

39:14.010 --> 39:16.149
Why was she still
in a coma today?

39:16.180 --> 39:20.082
Why didn't she miraculously
wake up this morning?

39:20.120 --> 39:23.851
Who did she have
left to kill?

39:23.890 --> 39:25.778
Do you think, perhaps,
it was someone who stood

39:25.830 --> 39:27.821
between her and the entirety

39:27.860 --> 39:30.351
of the family fortune?

39:36.040 --> 39:38.668
You mind that big heart,
Ms. Ellison.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.804
It'll beat longer.

39:47.110 --> 39:48.839
GREGSON:
You taking off?

39:48.880 --> 39:50.017
Case is closed,
is it not?

39:50.050 --> 39:51.881
It is.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.457
Which is why you should come
join us for drinks in a bit.

39:54.490 --> 39:56.151
Bell here is buying.

39:56.190 --> 39:57.782
I'm under orders.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.185
That said, I, uh,

39:59.230 --> 40:01.528
appreciate the help
you gave us.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.092
GREGSON:
So what do you say?

40:04.130 --> 40:05.825
Drinks?

40:05.870 --> 40:06.996
In about an hour?

40:07.030 --> 40:09.464
Another time, perhaps.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.434
All right.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.539
More malodorous takeout.
How wonderful.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.912
What is this?
Five nights in a row?

40:21.950 --> 40:24.043
It's Mediterranean,
I hope you like garlic.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.980
You'd think
that for what

40:26.020 --> 40:28.181
my father is paying you,
you'd learn to cook.

40:28.220 --> 40:30.609
(chuckles)

40:33.060 --> 40:34.721
What?
You want to talk

40:34.760 --> 40:37.194
about what happened in
the support meeting tonight?

40:37.230 --> 40:38.993
Something happened?

40:39.030 --> 40:40.520
You listened.
You let

40:40.570 --> 40:42.492
someone else's
natterings penetrate

40:42.540 --> 40:43.689
that attic you call a skull

40:43.740 --> 40:45.037
and it helped you
catch a killer.

40:45.070 --> 40:48.437
You want a thank you?
Fine. Thank you.

40:52.780 --> 40:55.044
Do you you close
yourself off to people

40:55.080 --> 40:58.846
and deny yourself things that
might bring you pleasure...

40:58.890 --> 41:02.189
not because it makes you
a better investigator,

41:02.220 --> 41:03.949
but because it's
some sort of penance?

41:03.990 --> 41:05.582
Penance?

41:05.630 --> 41:07.120
For what happened in London.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.821
Being addicted.

41:08.860 --> 41:12.023
_I don't know.
I guess it just occurred to me

41:12.070 --> 41:13.025
that it might be something

41:13.070 --> 41:15.595
that someone might do
and not even know it.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.508
Well, you always know it,
Watson.

41:19.540 --> 41:22.236
If you didn't,

41:22.280 --> 41:24.168
it wouldn't be penance.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.700
* Take

41:25.750 --> 41:27.274
* My hand

41:27.310 --> 41:30.711
* If it gets you through,
then it's all right *

41:32.020 --> 41:35.911
* Take my hand

41:38.060 --> 41:41.791
* But if you're... golden

41:41.830 --> 41:45.664
_ * Then it's
With a sense of regret... *

41:45.700 --> 41:48.533
* Then you'll never know

41:48.570 --> 41:50.697
* How it feels

41:53.240 --> 41:55.231
* To have hope

41:57.180 --> 42:01.002
* To have hope

42:01.050 --> 42:03.177
* To have hope
(unlocks case)

42:03.220 --> 42:05.814
* To have hope...

42:16.860 --> 42:19.829
(violin music starts)

42:23.340 --> 42:26.537
*
