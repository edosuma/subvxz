WEBVTT

00:03.133 --> 00:05.831
Wow, a little bit left.

00:05.918 --> 00:08.138
Mom's slowing down.

00:08.225 --> 00:11.054
And Victoria's picking up
the slack.

00:11.141 --> 00:13.796
[rumbling outside]

00:13.883 --> 00:15.015
Oh, God.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.365
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:17.452 --> 00:19.236
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Ow!

00:19.323 --> 00:21.151
No, no!

00:21.238 --> 00:23.197
Come on!

00:25.112 --> 00:28.245
Where's the key?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.291
[sighs]

00:32.293 --> 00:34.251
[doorbell ringing]

00:40.779 --> 00:42.259
Victoria, wake up!

00:42.346 --> 00:43.782
I'm locked out!

00:43.869 --> 00:45.393
Victoria!

00:45.480 --> 00:46.916
God!

00:47.003 --> 00:49.962
She's probably
in a Chardonnay coma.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.703
Ooh!

00:51.790 --> 00:53.792
Victoria!

01:09.895 --> 01:11.897
Victoria!

01:13.203 --> 01:16.467
Victoria, wake up!

01:16.554 --> 01:18.861
Ooh!

01:18.948 --> 01:20.950
Come on, wake up!

01:22.691 --> 01:24.693
[grunts]

01:29.524 --> 01:31.134
Oh, no, no, no!

01:31.221 --> 01:33.180
[groaning]

01:33.267 --> 01:36.096
Mol, what are you
doing out here?

01:36.183 --> 01:38.098
The door! Get the door!
Get the door!

01:38.185 --> 01:39.273
No!

01:39.360 --> 01:40.535
It's fine.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.102
There's a key
under the gnome.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.668
There should be.

01:43.755 --> 01:44.930
But Drunk Thing One
and Drunk Thing Two

01:45.017 --> 01:47.890
never put it back.

01:47.977 --> 01:48.847
Now, what are we gonna do?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.588
Because I'm freezing.

01:50.675 --> 01:53.374
Just stay calm.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.419
All right? The worst thing...

01:55.506 --> 01:58.074
the worst thing
we can do is panic.

02:09.303 --> 02:12.088
There was no other option.

02:12.175 --> 02:15.265
Better call Mom and tell her
we need a new window.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.440
What? You had a phone?

02:16.527 --> 02:17.572
Yeah, just give me
a minute.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.661
You...!

02:21.053 --> 02:23.795
♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪

02:23.882 --> 02:26.711
♪ La,

02:37.853 --> 02:41.291
♪ I see love.♪

02:47.993 --> 02:51.432
Damn it, this is gonna cost a
couple of hundred bucks to fix.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.390
Oh, I'm sorry,
we could've died out there.

02:53.477 --> 02:57.525
Oh, please! At most you would
have lost a toe to frostbite.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.701
[groans]

02:59.788 --> 03:02.225
And my poor, little gnome!

03:02.312 --> 03:04.227
If it makes you feel better,
he went quick.

03:04.314 --> 03:08.231
What were you
doing out there, anyway?

03:08.318 --> 03:10.146
I was taking out the trash

03:10.233 --> 03:13.280
from you and Victoria's
Alcoholics Unanimous meeting.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.761
Well, why didn't you go
to the neighbor's house?

03:16.848 --> 03:18.154
For the same reason we weren't
invited to the block party.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.242
They hate us.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.159
Well, I hope this is
a lesson for you.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.813
What lesson?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.467
Don't chase a garbage truck
down the street

03:26.554 --> 03:28.991
with a bag
full of your mother's empties?

03:29.078 --> 03:30.732
No.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.734
You break it, you buy it.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.084
That really isn't a lesson,
that's more store policy.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.086
Well, whatever it is,

03:37.173 --> 03:38.740
I know I'm not gonna see a dime.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.263
Well, based on what
you drank last night,

03:40.350 --> 03:42.309
I'm amazed you
can see anything.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.442
I guess I'll just add
a gnome and a window

03:45.529 --> 03:47.836
to the $3,800 you owe me.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.359
Hey, this is not all on me.
Victoria was there, too.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.056
And you're the one
who took the spare key.

03:51.143 --> 03:54.016
I was locked out.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.627
Do you have any idea
how cold it is outside?

03:56.714 --> 03:58.803
Don't worry, Mom,
I'll write you a check

03:58.890 --> 04:00.240
for my part of the window,
but I wanted to use a brick,

04:00.327 --> 04:03.808
so the gnome blood is
on her hands.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.380
I think you're doing
the right thing.

04:10.467 --> 04:11.642
Getting some plywood.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.253
Taking care of the window.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.819
That's 'cause I'm always
doing the right thing.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.821
I'm the only one responsible
in that house.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.955
And yet she holds
that $3,800 debt over my head

04:20.042 --> 04:21.652
like it was
the Sword of Damocles.

04:21.739 --> 04:22.958
Oh, I never saw that.
Is that like

04:23.045 --> 04:25.439
a Jason and the Argonautsmovie?

04:25.526 --> 04:27.397
It's Greek mythology.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.225
My mom dangles that money sword
over my head.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.662
And just...
she's just waiting for me

04:31.749 --> 04:33.360
to make the slightest mistake.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.926
Look, if it's bugging you
that much,

04:35.013 --> 04:36.885
why don't we just get rid
of the debt?

04:36.972 --> 04:38.756
'Cause we can't afford to.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.715
We kind of can.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.369
What?

04:42.456 --> 04:43.500
You remember when
our car insurance increased

04:43.587 --> 04:44.936
and my transmission went out?

04:45.023 --> 04:47.809
Yeah?Those things didn't happen.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.114
[gasps]

04:49.201 --> 04:50.768
Have you been hiding
money from me?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.553
Well, wouldn't you?

04:52.640 --> 04:53.423
God, I love you.[chuckles]

04:53.510 --> 04:55.599
How much do we have?

04:55.686 --> 04:56.992
Well, enough to cover
the $3,800.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.428
Let's just leave it at that.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.082
Can we really do this?
Can we...?

05:00.169 --> 05:02.214
Can I get that little red-headed
monkey off of my back?

05:02.302 --> 05:06.131
Well, we'll be robbing Peter to
pay Joyce, but what the hell?

05:06.218 --> 05:08.177
Thank you.
Oh!

05:08.264 --> 05:10.135
Oh! Sorry!Don't tell it to me.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.877
Tell it to the guy that used
to be on the motorcycle!

05:12.964 --> 05:14.052
Oh, no, he's fine.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.098
He's giving us the finger.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.190
You want the tire tread
inside or out?

05:21.277 --> 05:24.019
Out-- let the neighbors
look at it.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.587
They hate us anyway.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.459
Okay, here is your new gnome.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.679
And a little something extra.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.812
What's this?A check for $3,875.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.379
My debt to you,
plus my portion of the window.

05:36.466 --> 05:40.557
We are clean. Tabula rasa.

05:40.644 --> 05:41.906
Wow, this is unexpected.

05:41.993 --> 05:44.474
I know. And you're welcome.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.215
Well, Molly,
you don't have to do this.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.522
I know you guys can't afford it.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.393
Let's let it ride
a little longer.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.005
No, no, real... I really want
to pay you back what I owe you.

05:54.092 --> 05:55.964
No, I don't feel comfortable
taking money from you right now.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.357
No... it's yours.
Just take the check, Mom.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.881
Don't be ridiculous.
You keep it.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.491
What if you just gave
the money to charity?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.058
Oh, don't.Stay out of it.

06:05.103 --> 06:05.713
The check'll probably
bounce anyway.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.932
I wrote it.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.892
Take the check, Joyce!

06:10.979 --> 06:12.720
Yeah, take the check, Joyce.

06:12.807 --> 06:15.070
I don't want to owe you
anything anymore.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.201
Oh, oh, well, if that's
the case, it's gonna take

06:16.288 --> 06:18.116
a lot more than 3,800 bucks.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.291
Well, what is
that supposed to mean?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.815
Well, you live here for free.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.774
I mean, what about rent,
utilities, property tax,

06:23.861 --> 06:25.733
homeowner's insurance,
water bill?

06:25.820 --> 06:27.125
Yeah, are we gonna
start adding stuff up?

06:27.212 --> 06:28.997
'Cause I do dishes,
I do the laundry,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.173
I pick up dry cleaning,
I pick up your prescriptions.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.088
I pick up all the empty
wine bottles around here

06:33.175 --> 06:34.481
that you're not supposed
to be mixing

06:34.568 --> 06:37.266
with the prescriptions
I pick up!

06:37.353 --> 06:39.094
Well, if you're gonna be
around the house all day,

06:39.181 --> 06:40.312
you might as well
make yourself useful.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.879
Plus, you owe me four grand.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.446
That's what I'm trying to repay!

06:43.533 --> 06:45.709
Why?
You're just gonna need more.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.494
And come crawling back
to the Bank of Mama.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.017
Hey, I don't crawl!

06:49.104 --> 06:51.062
I take your money
with my head held high!

06:51.149 --> 06:53.891
Okay, well,
I can't win with you.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.284
I borrow money from
you, I'm wrong.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.459
I try to pay you
back, I'm wrong.

06:56.546 --> 06:57.547
Oh, here we go again.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.201
What "again"? I have never tried

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
to pay you back before!

07:02.291 --> 07:03.771
Because you're irresponsible.

07:03.858 --> 07:04.467
Me? You pay the kid
that shovels our walk

07:04.554 --> 07:07.078
with beer.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.602
It's called bartering.

07:08.689 --> 07:09.864
Which I do to save money

07:09.951 --> 07:11.431
so my unemployed daughter
can have

07:11.518 --> 07:12.606
a roof over her head

07:12.693 --> 07:14.172
and clothes on her back.Oh!

07:14.259 --> 07:15.347
What would I do
without Mommy, huh?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.392
I bet I couldn't even survive.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.002
JOYCE:
You wouldn't.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.482
Oh, yeah, you want to bet?

07:19.569 --> 07:20.483
Sure, you want me
to loan you the money

07:20.570 --> 07:21.876
so you can make that bet?

07:23.312 --> 07:24.356
Mike, pack your bag.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.489
We're leaving.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.708
Oh, Mom, come on!

07:27.795 --> 07:30.058
Relax, she'll be back in a day.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.451
No, I won't!
We're leaving for good.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.800
And I'll leave
my house key here.

07:32.887 --> 07:33.496
You can shove that
up your gnome.

07:38.588 --> 07:41.069
I guess I'm leaving.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.287
Looks like it.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.333
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.030
Joyce, what's for dinner?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.688
Did you see
the look on her face?

07:51.775 --> 07:54.343
She did not think
I was gonna move out.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.387
I got to be honest.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.346
I didn't think so, either.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.521
I just stuffed a couple towels

07:58.608 --> 08:01.219
in my duffel bag for effect.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.395
I mean, who is she to say
I can't make it out there?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.355
I mean, look at us.
We are making it fine.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.878
Fine? We got no money
and nowhere to go.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.272
And we got to roll
through the stop signs

08:10.359 --> 08:11.578
so the car don't stall.

08:11.665 --> 08:14.015
Mike, there have been
so many people

08:14.102 --> 08:16.800
that started out with less
and ended up in amazing places.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.586
Let's just see
where the road takes us.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.196
[door opens]

08:23.285 --> 08:25.940
I always knew
this day would come.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.334
Come on.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.476
[chuckles]

08:40.563 --> 08:41.738
I love what you haven't
done with the place.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.394
Just a warning.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.396
These walls are paper thin.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.877
If you're planning on playing
grab-ass, just know I can hear

08:49.964 --> 08:51.618
and feel everything
as if I was in the bed with you.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.145
Wow, that's...

08:57.232 --> 08:59.103
that's an effective speech.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.280
Hey, thanks for putting
us up, Ma. Night.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.022
Yeah, thanks, Peggy, and I know
it's last-minute notice,

09:05.109 --> 09:07.459
but it's nice to know
we can count on family.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.026
Well, I love my boy.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.637
[door closes]

09:10.724 --> 09:12.682
You, too!

09:13.814 --> 09:17.426
Kind of fun, huh?

09:17.513 --> 09:18.906
Sleeping in your old bed.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.125
Ah, congratulations,
you're the first girl

09:21.212 --> 09:24.433
to ever make it up here.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.478
You couldn't get them
past the warden, huh?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.219
No, there just weren't
any girls.

09:28.306 --> 09:29.917
Aw!

09:30.004 --> 09:31.571
You know, I've got to say--
pretty generous

09:31.658 --> 09:33.181
of your mom to let us
move in here like this.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.923
Move in? I thought
it was just for one night.
