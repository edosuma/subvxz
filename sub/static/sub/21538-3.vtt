WEBVTT

00:03.470 --> 00:05.171
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:05.205 --> 00:06.606
- WE COULD AGREE TO,
LIKE, 6.5.

00:06.639 --> 00:09.109
- I DON'T WANT TO GO
A DOLLAR OVER 6.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.077
- BUT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS
REAL FAST.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.912
- 6 MILLION,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXCITED.

00:15.415 --> 00:16.683
- DID YOU TALK
TO YOUR CLIENT?

00:16.716 --> 00:19.052
I THINK WE CAN JUST PUT ANGER
ASIDE HERE FOR A SECOND.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.155
DEAL!

00:22.188 --> 00:23.323
SCORE.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.825
- YOU KEEP ON PULLING TOO HARD
ON THE FISH,

00:25.859 --> 00:28.161
HE GETS OFF THE HOOK,
AND HE SWIMS AWAY.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.429
- WE HAVE A DEAL?

00:29.462 --> 00:31.064
- OKAY.
- YES!

00:31.097 --> 00:33.199
CONGRATS TO YOU, TODD.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.467
- DO YOU WANT ME TO CRY
IN FRONT OF YOU?

00:34.501 --> 00:35.468
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
- NO.

00:35.502 --> 00:36.870
IT WAS
THE MOST HUMILIATING THING

00:36.903 --> 00:39.339
ANYONE'S EVER DONE TO ME.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.542
[upbeat music]

00:42.575 --> 00:48.314
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.750
- NEW YORK CITY--
IT'S THE MOST EXCITING CITY

00:50.784 --> 00:52.786
FOR REAL ESTATE,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.355
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.058
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.759
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.827
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:00.860 --> 01:01.828
- I WANTED THIS THING

01:01.861 --> 01:03.263
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:03.296 --> 01:04.597
- IT'S OVER!

01:04.631 --> 01:08.601
* *

01:13.840 --> 01:16.109
- [sighs]

01:16.142 --> 01:17.110
OH.

01:17.143 --> 01:20.280
WHOA!
OOH!

01:20.313 --> 01:21.881
VEGAN.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.284
MY LISTING AT 60 WARREN
IS A BEAUTIFUL,

01:24.317 --> 01:27.620
ALL GREEN PENTHOUSE, BUT IT'S
ALSO BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.456
EVERYONE SAYS
THE SAME PUSHBACK--

01:29.489 --> 01:31.825
THE MONTHLIES,
WHICH INCLUDE EVERYTHING

01:31.858 --> 01:34.627
TO RUN THE BUILDING,
ARE TOO HIGH.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.632
- THE PRICE
HAS TO COME DOWN.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.701
WHEW.
THAT WAS A WORKOUT.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.437
- HEY, FREDRIK, HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.106
- I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU RIDE
A CITI BIKE.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.540
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

01:47.574 --> 01:50.210
- YEAH, I TRY MY BEST TO,
YOU KNOW,

01:50.243 --> 01:51.211
HELP THE WAY THAT I CAN.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.645
- THAT'S GOOD.

01:52.679 --> 01:57.517
- SO, YOU KNOW, I TOOK ON
THIS LISTING, 6 MILLION.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.518
- YEAH.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.186
- AND THE APARTMENT IS GREAT,

02:00.220 --> 02:02.088
BUT THE COMMON CHARGES
AND THE REAL ESTATE TAXES

02:02.122 --> 02:06.493
ARE ASTRONOMICAL--
9,000-PLUS A MONTH.

02:06.526 --> 02:08.828
- BUT, I MEAN, YOU KNEW THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.097
I MEAN,
THIS IS NOT NEW TO YOU.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.932
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.734
- I'M GETTING A LOT
OF PUSHBACK.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.970
IT'S A PROBLEM,

02:17.070 --> 02:21.441
SO I WANT TO CHANGE THE PRICE.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.210
6 MILLION
IS JUST TOO MUCH.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.247
I WANT TO GO
A LITTLE BIT LOWER.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.083
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING
LIKE 5 1/4.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.853
- UM...

02:33.887 --> 02:34.988
ARE YOU OKAY?

02:35.088 --> 02:37.090
- NO, I'M NOT OKAY
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:37.090 --> 02:39.125
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.994
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T,
YOU KNOW--

02:41.094 --> 02:43.296
YOU JUST CAME LEFT FIELD.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.398
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY--

02:45.432 --> 02:47.967
- DON'T KILL THE MESSENGER.
I'M DOING MY JOB.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.436
A LOT OF BROKERS WOULD NOT DARE

02:49.469 --> 02:50.770
TO EVEN TELL YOU
THIS INFORMATION

02:50.804 --> 02:52.105
AND JUST WAIT SEVEN MONTHS.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.540
YOU WANT ME TO WAIT
SEVEN MONTHS, I'LL DO IT.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.908
- NO, I DON'T HAVE SEVEN--
- I'M TELLING YOU.

02:54.941 --> 02:58.111
YOU WANT TO SELL IT--
- I DON'T HAVE SEVEN MONTHS.

02:58.111 --> 03:02.515
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I'M NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH YOU.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.616
- THINK ABOUT IT.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.418
AT $9,000 A MONTH,

03:05.452 --> 03:10.056
THAT'S AROUND 100--
$108,000 A YEAR IN MONTHLIES.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.291
- YEAH.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.226
- IN SOME PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY,
YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE

03:13.259 --> 03:17.597
FOR $100,000, AND HERE YOU HAVE
TO JUST PAY TO LIVE IN IT.

03:19.165 --> 03:22.469
5.5.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.770
NOT A DOLLAR HIGHER.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.213
- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THIS IS FINAL.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.082
- YES, I FEEL MUCH MORE
COMFORTABLE AT 5.5

03:36.082 --> 03:39.085
THAN I DO AT 6.

03:39.085 --> 03:41.521
- OKAY,
SO LET'S DO 5.5, OKAY?

03:41.554 --> 03:42.722
- OKAY.

03:42.756 --> 03:46.126
- OKAY, THEN, GREAT,
'CAUSE I GOT TO GO.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.928
- LIKE, LEAVE?
- THAT'S IT.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.431
- BYE, JOEL. THANK YOU.
YOU WANT TO USE MY BIKE?

03:57.837 --> 04:01.141
- YURI,
LET'S GO OVER TO THE MILAN.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.243
- TODAY I HAVE A LISTING
APPOINTMENT IN MIDTOWN EAST

04:03.276 --> 04:05.178
AT THE MILAN CONDOMINIUM.

04:05.211 --> 04:06.913
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
TRAVEL A LOT LIKE TO BE

04:06.946 --> 04:10.250
IN MIDTOWN EAST BECAUSE THEY CAN
EASILY GET OFF TO THE AIRPORT.

04:10.283 --> 04:14.187
I RECENTLY SOLD AN APARTMENT
ON THE 19TH FLOOR

04:14.220 --> 04:16.523
OF THIS BUILDING,
AND APPARENTLY THE OWNER

04:16.556 --> 04:19.559
WAS SO IMPRESSED,
SHE GAVE ME A CALL.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.794
HI.
- HI.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.362
- RYAN.
- SAM. NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.064
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.165
OOH!
- COME ON IN.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.268
- WOW!

04:28.301 --> 04:30.670
SO YOU HAVE PRETTY KILLER VIEWS
UP HERE, HUH?

04:30.704 --> 04:33.440
- YEAH, CHRYSLER BUILDING
AND EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,

04:33.473 --> 04:34.607
THE RIVER.
- COOL.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.076
YOU WANT TO SHOW ME AROUND
A LITTLE BIT?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.243
- SURE.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.089
- WHOA.
YOU HAVE, LIKE, VERTIGO HERE.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.490
- YEAH, A LOT OF VISITORS

04:50.523 --> 04:52.092
DON'T COME OVER
TO THE WINDOWS.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.893
- COOL!

04:53.927 --> 04:56.329
THIS IS GREAT OUTDOOR SPACE.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.369
AWESOME!

05:02.402 --> 05:06.039
SO WHAT'S YOUR TIMELINE LIKE?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.640
- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
A TIMELINE.

05:07.674 --> 05:12.812
WE BOUGHT AN APARTMENT,
AND WE ARE MOVING UPTOWN.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.614
WE REALLY JUST WANTED
TO BE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER

05:14.647 --> 05:16.082
TO MY KIDS' SCHOOL.
- OKAY.

05:16.116 --> 05:19.819
- BUT I REALLY DO THINK, ONE
DAY, WE NEED TO COME BACK HERE.

05:19.853 --> 05:20.854
- TO THIS ONE.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.722
- I FEEL LIKE THIS IS MY HOME.
- OKAY.

05:22.756 --> 05:26.426
- SO I'M NOT 100% SURE
I REALLY WANT TO SELL.

05:26.459 --> 05:27.894
- UH-HUH.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.730
- MAYBE I WANT TO RENT.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.966
- RENT.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO RENT?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.468
RENTING?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.604
TERRIBLE.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.305
- I LOVE THIS APARTMENT,
RYAN.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.807
- I LOVE IT TOO.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.142
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO--REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY WANT TO SELL IT.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.511
- MY KIDS LEARNED TO WALK
IN THIS APARTMENT.

05:44.544 --> 05:45.879
- RIGHT.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.981
- I HAVE VIDEOS OF THEM LEARNING
TO WALK IN THIS APARTMENT.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.649
- THAT'S GREAT,
SO YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE THAT

05:49.683 --> 05:50.850
TO REMEMBER
IN YOUR NEW APARTMENT.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.185
- [sighs]

05:52.218 --> 05:56.423
I JUST FEEL LIKE
THIS APARTMENT IS MY HOME,

05:56.456 --> 05:58.892
THIS IS WHERE I WAS PREGNANT,
THIS IS WHERE, LIKE,

05:58.925 --> 06:02.162
THE DOORMEN WATCHED MY CHILDREN
GROW UP,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.397
AND MY KIDS ARE SO HAPPY,
LIKE, EVERY SINGLE DAY

06:04.431 --> 06:08.301
WHEN THEY COME HOME
FROM SCHOOL TO SEE THEM.

06:08.335 --> 06:12.038
- OH, MY GOD,
IS SHE GOING TO CRY RIGHT NOW?

06:12.072 --> 06:13.807
OH, GOD.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.141
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HANDLE CRYING WOMEN.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.777
I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.613
- IMAGINE BEING
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY,

06:20.647 --> 06:24.751
AND IMAGINE LETTING SOMEONE
BORROW THAT PERSON,

06:24.784 --> 06:26.419
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?

06:26.453 --> 06:28.221
- I DON'T KNOW IF I REALLY WANT
TO IMAGINE THAT.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.522
- RIGHT, SO DON'T.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.191
RENTING IS A BAD IDEA,

06:31.224 --> 06:32.525
BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE GONNA COME IN HERE.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.160
THEY'RE GONNA PUT
ALL THEIR OWN STUFF IN HERE.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.662
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE
ALL THEIR OWN MEMORIES

06:35.695 --> 06:36.863
WHERE YOU
MADE YOUR MEMORIES.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.365
THEY'RE GONNA PAINT
THE CEILINGS,

06:38.398 --> 06:40.233
DESTROY THE MASTER BEDROOM,
AND THERE'S GOING TO BE ISSUES--

06:40.266 --> 06:41.434
THE BATHTUB'S GONNA BREAK.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.069
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL
WITH IT,

06:43.103 --> 06:44.104
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN,

06:44.137 --> 06:45.805
THIS HOUSE THAT YOU LOVE
SO MUCH

06:45.839 --> 06:47.273
AND YOU MADE
ALL THESE MEMORIES IN,

06:47.307 --> 06:48.575
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT
ANYMORE,

06:48.608 --> 06:50.410
AND ALL THOSE MEMORIES
ARE GOING TO, LIKE,

06:50.443 --> 06:53.246
FADE AWAY AS THEY
SLOWLY DESTROY THE HOME

06:53.279 --> 06:54.681
THAT YOU LOVED
FOR SO LONG.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.884
- YEAH.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.920
- SO, I MEAN,
YOU CALLED ME, RIGHT?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.022
- YES, AND--

07:02.022 --> 07:03.256
- BECAUSE YOU DO NEED
TO DO SOMETHING.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.557
- WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.326
- OKAY, SO IF YOU WERE
GOING TO SELL,

07:06.359 --> 07:08.028
THEN WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

07:08.061 --> 07:09.596
- WELL, I DISCUSSED IT
WITH MY HUSBAND,

07:09.629 --> 07:11.197
SINCE HE COULDN'T BE HERE,
AND WE'VE DECIDED

07:11.231 --> 07:13.466
WE'LL TRY OUR BEST
TO GET 6 1/2,

07:13.500 --> 07:16.069
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
THEN WE'LL RENT,

07:16.102 --> 07:18.471
AND THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO COME BACK HERE EVENTUALLY...

07:18.505 --> 07:19.472
- RIGHT.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.208
- EVEN WITH MY MEMORIES
BEING DESTROYED.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.310
- AND YOU MAY GET
WHAT YOU WANT,

07:24.344 --> 07:27.213
'CAUSE 6 1/2
IS REALLY HIGH.

07:27.247 --> 07:31.317
THAT'S, LIKE,
NEARLY $2,600 A FOOT.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.452
- YEAH.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.387
- I MEAN, WE JUST SOLD
A UNIT DOWNSTAIRS

07:34.421 --> 07:37.357
FOR ABOUT 1,900 A FOOT,
SO LET'S SAY WE ROUND IT UP--

07:37.390 --> 07:39.059
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 1,900
AND 2,000 A FOOT...

07:39.092 --> 07:40.293
- OKAY, SO--

07:40.326 --> 07:41.895
- BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF
THAT THIS APARTMENT HAS

07:41.928 --> 07:44.564
AND NOTHING ELSE HAS,
WOULD PUT THIS APARTMENT

07:44.597 --> 07:47.600
AT ABOUT 5 MILLION, OKAY?

07:47.634 --> 07:49.402
- NO.
- NO?

07:49.436 --> 07:51.204
- NO.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.073
- SO IF SOMEONE CAME
IN HERE RIGHT NOW AND SAID,

07:53.106 --> 07:56.076
"HERE'S $6 MILLION,"
WOULD YOU TAKE IT?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.078
- NO.
- NO.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.813
- NO.
6 1/2.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.614
- I SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING, YEAH.
- 6 1/2.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.649
- 6 1/2.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.017
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.485
- GREAT.
- AND THEN I'M THE GUY TO DO IT.

08:05.518 --> 08:06.786
- OKAY.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.056
- SOMETIMES EMOTIONAL SELLERS
CAN BE A BIT IRRATIONAL

08:10.090 --> 08:12.592
WITH THE PRICE THEY WANT,
AND IF 6.5 IS WHAT

08:12.625 --> 08:15.395
IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR HER
TO RUN FROM HER MEMORIES,

08:15.428 --> 08:17.931
I CAN GO IN THERE AND KIND OF
SHAVE OFF THAT MEMORY

08:18.031 --> 08:21.034
AND SHAVE OFF THAT MEMORY,
UNTIL I GET WHAT I WANT.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.168
- THANK YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.204
- YOU TOO.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.876
[horn honks]

08:29.909 --> 08:31.111
- ALL RIGHT.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.479
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.913
LET'S GO
TO 30 LINCOLN PLAZA.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.416
THAT'S
30 WEST 63RD STREET.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.618
MY NEW LISTING APPOINTMENT
IS ON 30 LINCOLN PLAZA,

08:38.651 --> 08:40.420
WHICH IS OWNED
BY MILSTEIN PROPERTIES.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.821
IT'S LOCATED ON 63RD STREET

08:41.855 --> 08:43.423
BETWEEN BROADWAY
AND CENTRAL PARK WEST,

08:43.456 --> 08:45.191
WHICH IS PRIME UPPER WEST SIDE.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.294
THE LINCOLN CENTER AREA IS
THE CULTURAL CENTER OF THE CITY.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.597
IT'S WHERE YOU GO
TO SEE THE SYMPHONIES,

08:50.630 --> 08:53.400
THE OPERA, THE BALLET.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.302
FOR DECADES, THE MILSTEIN FAMILY
HAS BEEN BUYING, RENOVATING,

08:56.336 --> 08:58.371
AND SELLING APARTMENTS
ALL OVER THE CITY.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.306
WITHIN THE PEOPLE
THAT UNDERSTAND THIS BUSINESS,

09:00.340 --> 09:02.842
THEY HAVE THE BEST REPUTATION
THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.110
JANET!

09:04.144 --> 09:05.211
- HI, LUIS, HOW ARE YOU?
- IT IS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.212
- IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU
AS WELL.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.313
- HOW ARE YOU?
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.749
JANET HAS HER OWN
ON-SITE STAFF OF BROKERS

09:09.783 --> 09:11.651
THAT SELL FOR THE BUILDING,
AND THEY CALL AGENTS

09:11.685 --> 09:13.153
LIKE MYSELF
TO BRING THEM BUYERS.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.221
- I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO REALLY LIKE THIS APARTMENT.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.556
- WELL,
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.491
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BRING A BUYER FOR JANET.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.027
I WANT TO SELL THIS APARTMENT
FOR HER.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.929
SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW THAT YET.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.898
- TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LIGHT.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.467
- OH, MY GOD.
- IS THAT AMAZING?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.069
- I LIKE THE FACT THAT
THE KITCHEN IS OPEN,

09:29.102 --> 09:30.637
BECAUSE NORMALLY,
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE,

09:30.670 --> 09:31.771
YOU HAVE FORMAL DINING ROOMS,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.106
AND EVERYTHING'S
COMPLETELY SEPARATE.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.307
NOW IT'S A BIT
MORE CONTEMPORARY.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.342
- EXACTLY.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.247
TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIEW.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.782
AS YOU KNOW,
THERE'S SOME WONDERFUL THINGS

09:42.816 --> 09:45.285
THAT GO ON AT LINCOLN CENTER,
AND YOU HAVE THE FRONT-ROW SEAT.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.287
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
- [chuckles]

09:49.322 --> 09:51.191
- THIS BUILDING
IS PERFECT.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.626
IT HAS INCREDIBLE AMENITIES.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.195
THE VIEWS ARE BEAUTIFUL.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.363
EVERYTHING IS VERY ELEGANT,

09:56.396 --> 09:58.732
VERY SOPHISTICATED,
VERY REFINED.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.901
I HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE
AN AMAZING, AMAZING PROPERTY.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.069
- THANK YOU.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.504
- NOW, I HAVE TO BE
VERY HONEST WITH YOU.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.874
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO BRING YOU BUYERS.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.275
- HMM.

10:09.309 --> 10:14.547
I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WANT
TO EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENT YOU.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.982
- AH.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.452
YOU DO KNOW, I'M SURE,
THAT WE HAVE ON-SITE BROKERS.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.854
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.189
- SO WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.859
- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE PRICING
THE UNIT AT 7 MILLION.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.728
THAT IS $2,300 A FOOT.
- MM-HMM.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.797
- YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
50 CENTRAL PARK WEST, RIGHT?

10:30.830 --> 10:31.931
- YES.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.266
- THEIR CURRENT APARTMENT
ON THE MARKET

10:33.299 --> 10:35.635
IS AN AVERAGE OF $5,000 A SQUARE
FOOT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:35.669 --> 10:37.570
WE'RE RIGHT NEXT TO IT.
- MM-HMM.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.739
- YOU KNOW WHY THEY CAN
SELL AT THAT PRICE?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.141
PERCEPTION.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.943
MARKETING IS WHERE IT'S AT
RIGHT NOW, AND TODAY,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.179
THAT BUILDING IS
THE TOP BUILDING IN THE CITY.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.681
- THAT'S TRUE.

10:47.714 --> 10:48.982
- I WANT TO BE THE MAN
THAT CREATES

10:49.015 --> 10:50.717
THAT PERCEPTION
FOR THIS BUILDING.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.420
- LUIS, YOU DO HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND--WE DON'T MARKET.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.056
WE DON'T TAKE FULL-PAGE ADS OUT
IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.292
WE DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED IT.
IT'S ALL WORD OF MOUTH.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.728
- I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU HAVEN'T USED IT IN THE PAST,

11:01.761 --> 11:02.762
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.230
TIMES ARE DIFFERENT NOW,

11:04.264 --> 11:06.466
AND RIGHT NOW,
WE ARE IN A VERY CRAZY MARKET.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.567
PEOPLE ARE GOING NUTS.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.369
IT'S NOT ABOUT SELLING UNITS.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.672
IT'S ABOUT SELLING THEM
FOR THE TOP DOLLAR.

11:12.706 --> 11:15.742
I THINK THIS BUILDING
NEEDS A FRESH ENERGY.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.577
I WOULD BRING
A BIG MARKETING TEAM,

11:17.610 --> 11:20.113
PACKAGE THE PRODUCT COMPLETELY,
AND I WANT TO COME IN

11:20.146 --> 11:23.116
AND PRICE THIS UNIT
AT 7.8 MILLION.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.319
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU CAN GET 7.8 MILLION

11:26.353 --> 11:27.320
FOR THAT APARTMENT?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.621
- ABSOLUTELY.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.090
- 'CAUSE THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.359
- VERY CONFIDENT.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.694
BUT IN ORDER FOR ME
TO BRING THOSE BUYERS IN

11:34.728 --> 11:36.763
AND FOR ME TO SPEND
ALL THAT TIME AND MONEY

11:36.796 --> 11:38.164
AND PUT MY TEAM BEHIND IT,

11:38.198 --> 11:39.733
I NEED A COMMITMENT FROM YOU,

11:39.766 --> 11:42.302
AND THAT'S WHY
I NEED AN EXCLUSIVE.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.310
- I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU ONE.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.812
ONE UNIT, SIX MONTHS,

11:52.846 --> 11:54.114
WITH AN OUT.

11:54.114 --> 11:58.418
SO AT ANY POINT HERE
THAT WE COULD END UP DOING THIS,

11:58.451 --> 12:00.053
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BE ABLE TO DELIVER

12:00.053 --> 12:01.888
ON WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU'RE PROMISING.

12:01.921 --> 12:02.889
- YEAH, I WILL.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.924
[bleep], I GOT IT.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.127
I WON'T DISAPPOINT.
- I'M COUNTING ON THAT.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.561
- [laughs]

12:08.595 --> 12:10.163
I AM GOING TO PROVE TO JANET
THAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE

12:10.196 --> 12:12.966
TO BRING IN
ALMOST $1 MILLION MORE

12:13.066 --> 12:14.100
THAN THEIR SALES AGENTS.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.602
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.836
- IT'S A PLEASURE
AND AN HONOR.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.139
THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.306
HUGE!

12:20.340 --> 12:21.908
BIG!

12:21.941 --> 12:25.412
LIKE, BIG.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.081
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE'RE EVEN ARGUING.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.115
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BROKER.
- WE'RE NOT ARGUING!

12:29.149 --> 12:30.917
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WORK FOR ME.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.452
- I'M WORKING FOR YOU.
- YOU'RE WORKING AGAINST ME.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.720
- NO, I'M NOT
WORKING AGAINST YOU.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.089
THIS SITUATION'S WORKING
AGAINST BOTH OF US.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.600
- CAN YOU POP ANOTHER BOTTLE,
AND I'LL START POURING?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.269
- SO WE HAVE CHAMPAGNE
WITH STRAWBERRIES.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.670
DO WE HAVE ANY FOOD OR NO?
NO FOOD?

12:50.704 --> 12:51.805
- NO.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.907
- TYPICALLY WE THROW
AN EXCLUSIVE OPEN HOUSE

12:53.940 --> 12:57.177
WITH VERY HIGH-END BROKERS,
BUT THIS TIME WE'RE DOING THINGS

12:57.210 --> 13:00.447
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY,
AND CASTING A VERY WIDE NET,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.048
BECAUSE I HAVE
AN EMOTIONAL SELLER.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.249
[exhales]

13:03.283 --> 13:04.884
SHE COULD WAKE UP
TOMORROW MORNING AND SAY,

13:04.918 --> 13:06.519
"NO! WHAT?
NO, I LOVE THIS PLACE.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.455
"THIS IS MY BABIES AND
THE FOOTSTEPS AND THE CHEERIOS."

13:08.488 --> 13:10.256
SO I GOT TO GET PEOPLE
IN THERE AND JUST SAY,

13:10.290 --> 13:12.459
"HEY, HEY, MONEY, MONEY!
HERE'S ALL THAT MONEY!

13:12.492 --> 13:13.760
"LIKE, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE
THOSE CHEERIOS

13:13.793 --> 13:15.628
'CAUSE I'M PUTTING
SO MUCH MONEY ON IT!"

13:15.662 --> 13:16.629
HELLO.
- HELLO.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.898
- HI. RYAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

13:18.932 --> 13:20.700
HEY, MAN.
RYAN. HOW ARE YOU?

13:20.734 --> 13:24.237
SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE
GREATEST PENTHOUSE IN THE WORLD.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.605
THE APARTMENT RIGHT NEXT DOOR
IS WHAT THEY USED

13:25.638 --> 13:27.607
FOR<i>WOLF OF WALL STREET,</i>
<i>GOSSIP GIRL.</i>

13:27.640 --> 13:28.875
I THINK IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.
- IT'S FANTASTIC.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.310
- IT'S VERY TIMELESS,

13:30.343 --> 13:32.812
THE CLASSIC MIDTOWN PENTHOUSE

13:32.846 --> 13:35.215
WITH INSANE VIEWS
AND OUTDOOR SPACE.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.249
- ABSOLUTELY.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.551
- THIS BALCONY'S AMAZING.
- YEAH.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.786
HELLO.
- HI, RYAN.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.087
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

13:41.087 --> 13:44.391
- OH, YOU SAW MY HAND.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BLIND.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.392
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.494
WHERE DO YOU WORK?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.462
- "ALATINO"?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.164
- I'M GONNA REMEMBER THAT.
I JUST FORGOT IT.

13:51.197 --> 13:53.400
- UM, I HAVE
A COUPLE OF CLIENTS,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.535
AND ONE OF THEM
IS AN OPERA SINGER.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.137
- OPRAH?
- YEAH, A VERY FAMOUS ITALIAN--

13:57.170 --> 13:58.938
- OH, OPERA SINGER.

13:58.972 --> 14:03.576
- YEAH, AND THE OTHER ONE
IS THE SON OF A DRUG DEALER.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.045
- THE SON OF A DRUG DEALER?
- YES.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.046
- I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.447
[laughter]

14:07.480 --> 14:10.050
SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
WHEN YOU THROW EXCLUSIVITY

14:10.083 --> 14:12.619
OUT THE WINDOW IS YOU'RE GONNA
GET SOME CRAZY PEOPLE.

14:14.754 --> 14:15.722
- TO GO TO THE EAST RIVER?

14:15.755 --> 14:18.491
- GONNA, LIKE, CATCH DINNER.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.593
- UH, JUST LET ME KNOW
BEFOREHAND.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.928
- WELL, I'M COMING IN
FROM THE TOP.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.630
I DO NINJA WORK
ON THE SIDE.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.765
- YOU'RE THE MOST INTERESTING
GUY I'VE EVER MET.

14:25.799 --> 14:27.634
WHEN DID YOU GET
INTO REAL ESTATE?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.837
SIX WEEKS AGO?
- YES.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.605
- ARE WE KEEPING TRACK OF,
LIKE, ALL THEIR ART

14:32.639 --> 14:36.376
AND JEWELRY AND STUFF,
MAKE SURE NOTHING GETS STOLEN?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.712
DID YOU BRING A BUYER?
- SORRY.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.180
- THAT'S THE WAY
YOU GET INTO THE OPEN--

14:40.213 --> 14:42.482
WHO LET YOU IN?
[cork pops]

14:42.515 --> 14:45.618
BUT THE THING IS,
I LIKE CRAZY.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.088
AND IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM,
JOIN 'EM.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.524
[mumbling]

14:51.558 --> 14:52.525
- [laughs]

14:52.559 --> 14:55.095
- DID THAT TURN YOU ON?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.296
- WELL,
YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND ME.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.564
WE'LL PUT SOME STRIPPER POLES
IN THERE.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.932
IT'LL BE GOOD.
- I JUST SMELL, AND I FIND YOU.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.033
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.234
- IT'S A GOOD APARTMENT,

15:01.267 --> 15:02.836
BUT AT ALMOST $3,000
PER SQUARE FOOT--

15:02.869 --> 15:04.037
- IT'S 2,500 A FOOT.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.239
YOU'RE ASIAN.
CAN'T YOU DO MATH?

15:06.272 --> 15:10.377
CLEARLY, EXCLUSIVITY
IS A BETTER WAY TO GO.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.712
[imitates gunshot]

15:16.249 --> 15:17.217
- JOEL!

15:17.250 --> 15:18.618
- HEY, FREDRIK.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.053
HOW ARE YOU?

15:20.053 --> 15:22.288
- JOEL ASKED ME TO COME
AND MEET HIM AT THE PENTHOUSE.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.656
HE SAID IT WAS URGENT,

15:23.690 --> 15:26.626
SO I HOPE HE HASN'T CHANGED
HIS MIND ABOUT PRICE.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.361
SO?

15:28.395 --> 15:31.431
- OKAY,
THERE IS A LITTLE PROBLEM

15:31.464 --> 15:33.867
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION
NEXT DOOR.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.902
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE BUILDING
THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.070
THE CONSTRUCTION.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.505
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

15:38.538 --> 15:41.141
- BECAUSE THEIR BUILDING'S
ACTUALLY GOING TO GO HIGHER

15:41.174 --> 15:44.310
THAN THIS BUILDING,
THEY NEED TO PUT SCAFFOLDING.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.720
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
OKAY, WAIT, BACK UP. BACK UP.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.957
YOU'RE SAYING THE TERRACES
MIGHT GET COVERED?

15:57.991 --> 16:00.894
- YEAH.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.562
- LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.563
- OKAY.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.165
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.100
THIS IS ALREADY
A CHALLENGE APARTMENT,

16:07.133 --> 16:09.703
AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO SELL
BECAUSE OF THE MONTHLIES,

16:09.736 --> 16:13.606
AND NOW HE'S ADDING
YET ANOTHER CHALLENGE?

16:13.640 --> 16:14.808
SO THIS IS THE BUILDING.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.042
- THIS IS THE BUILDING.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.578
- THIS WILL AFFECT OFFERS,
PRICE, EVERYTHING.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.180
- THE BUILDING IS GOING
TO COME UP RIGHT HERE,

16:20.213 --> 16:22.716
AND AS IT GOES UP,
THERE'LL BE A PLATFORM

16:22.749 --> 16:24.317
TO MAKE SURE
THAT IF SOMETHING FALLS,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.086
IT DOESN'T FALL
ON THE PEOPLE HERE.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.355
THERE'LL BE, LIKE,
A CANOPY ABOVE.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.756
- I MEAN, JOEL,
LISTEN TO THE NOISE!

16:29.789 --> 16:31.157
THEY'RE ALREADY
STARTING CONSTRUCTION.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.359
THIS IS WHAT
IT'S GONNA SOUND LIKE,

16:32.392 --> 16:33.827
AND THEN THE SCAFFOLDING
FOR TWO YEARS--

16:33.860 --> 16:35.161
IT'S MY JOB TO TELL YOU--

16:35.195 --> 16:36.696
I WOULDN'T DO MY JOB
OTHERWISE--

16:36.730 --> 16:38.231
IT COULD BE
AS MUCH AS $1 MILLION

16:38.264 --> 16:40.834
DOWN IN THE PRICE.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.302
- THAT'S WHAT WE
LOWERED THE PRICE.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.303
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT--

16:43.336 --> 16:44.704
- NO, WE LOWERED THE PRICE

16:44.738 --> 16:45.939
'CAUSE OF THE COMMON CHARGES
AND REAL ESTATE TAXES.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.475
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
- DO YOUR MAGIC.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.276
BRING ME A GOOD OFFER TODAY,
AND LET'S MOVE ON.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.578
LET'S NOT HAVE
THIS DISCUSSION.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.079
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE'RE EVEN ARGUING.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.514
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BROKER.
- WE'RE NOT ARGUING!

16:54.547 --> 16:56.182
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WORK FOR ME.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.617
- I'M WORKING FOR YOU.
- YOU'RE WORKING AGAINST ME.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.219
- NO, I'M NOT WORKING
AGAINST YOU.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.087
THIS SITUATION'S
WORKING AGAINST BOTH OF US.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.189
IT IS MY JOB TO TELL YOU

17:03.223 --> 17:05.225
THIS IS COMPROMISING THE VALUE
OF YOUR APARTMENT.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.060
THE SITUATION,
IT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

17:07.093 --> 17:10.196
- NO, I THINK YOUR JOB IS REALLY
TO GO OUT AND GET ME--

17:10.230 --> 17:11.564
- GO DOWN AND TELL THESE PEOPLE
TO BE QUIET DOWN THERE?

17:11.598 --> 17:12.932
- NO, NO, NO.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.834
- STOP THE SAWING MACHINE?
- GO OUT AND GET ME THE 5.5.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.336
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHY I HIRED YOU.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.570
I MEAN, YOU'RE SUPER-BROKER.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.039
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE MIRACLES.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.674
- QUIET DOWN THERE!

17:20.707 --> 17:24.244
- FREDRIK, LISTEN, I WANT
TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH YOU.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.679
I ALREADY
LOWERED MY PRICE.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.580
IF YOU CAN'T
GET ME 5.5,

17:27.614 --> 17:29.249
THEN I'LL JUST TAKE IT
OFF THE MARKET.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.184
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT,
PERIOD.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.919
- OH, MY GOD.

17:32.952 --> 17:36.289
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
OH, MY GOD.

17:36.322 --> 17:37.590
IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE IN THE OCEAN

17:37.624 --> 17:39.359
AND THIS HUGE WAVE
COMES OVER YOU,

17:39.392 --> 17:41.361
YOU FALL, AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
AHH, ALMOST DROWNING,

17:41.394 --> 17:42.929
AND THEN YOU STAND UP,
AND YOU THINK, YOU'RE LIKE,

17:42.962 --> 17:45.165
"I ACTUALLY SURVIVED THIS WAVE."

17:45.198 --> 17:47.834
AND HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE,
A BIG, DEADLY WAVE.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.075
- ALL RIGHT,
SO GOOD MORNING, GUYS.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.276
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.977
WE'VE GOT GREAT COPYWRITERS,
PHOTOGRAPHERS,

17:58.078 --> 18:00.914
MARKETING AND FINANCE,
CREATIVE DIRECTORS.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.582
LAST YEAR,
I USED ALL THE TYPICAL TOOLS

18:02.615 --> 18:03.817
TO ADVERTISE A LISTING,

18:03.850 --> 18:05.585
BUT THIS YEAR I WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING GREATER.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.487
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO PUT THE MOST CREATIVE

18:07.520 --> 18:09.823
MARKETING MINDS TOGETHER
AND COME UP WITH A VERY FRESH

18:09.856 --> 18:12.792
AND ORIGINAL STRATEGY
TO MARKET 30 LINCOLN.

18:12.826 --> 18:15.929
I WANT TO CREATE AN EVENT
THAT KEEPS NEW YORK TALKING,

18:16.029 --> 18:17.297
SO I JUST WANT
TO HEAR THE IDEAS,

18:17.330 --> 18:18.865
FIRST THINGS THAT COME TO MIND.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.266
- COHOST AN EVENT
WITH CHRISTIE'S,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.469
AN AUCTION HOUSE
WHERE YOU CAN SHOWCASE

18:22.502 --> 18:24.838
SOME OF THE MATERIAL
THAT'S IN THE BUILDING.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.840
- I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES
WE DO PARTIES,

18:26.873 --> 18:28.942
IT BECOMES ABOUT THE ART,
NOT ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.043
- MM-HMM.
- RIGHT.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.177
- SO I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.912
- A MODEL, RIGHT?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.447
IT'S A DIGITAL TOUR.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.682
- BUT YOU'RE SAYING

18:35.715 --> 18:37.317
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE
IN THE APARTMENT?

18:37.350 --> 18:38.551
- NO, IT'LL BE DIGITAL.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.719
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:39.753 --> 18:41.287
IT'S A $7.8-MILLION INVESTMENT.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.589
I NEED TO TOUCH
THAT MOTHER[bleep].

18:42.622 --> 18:45.492
[laughter]

18:45.525 --> 18:48.561
ONE THING THAT HAS
NEVER GOTTEN OLD ARE STORIES,

18:48.595 --> 18:50.397
AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THINGS
MUCH BETTER

18:50.430 --> 18:51.798
WHEN THERE'S A STORY
BEHIND IT.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.266
- WE CAN ALSO CREATE
AN EXPERIENCE

18:53.299 --> 18:55.969
OF HOW IT IS GONNA BE TO LIVE
IN THIS PLACE,

18:56.069 --> 19:00.006
SO IF WE COULD, LIKE,
FIND A WAY TO MAKE THEM FEEL

19:00.006 --> 19:01.141
HOW IT'S GOING TO BE...

19:01.174 --> 19:03.743
- YES.
- ONCE YOU BUY THAT APARTMENT.

19:03.777 --> 19:06.646
- SORT OF LIKE A DAY-IN-THE-LIFE
KIND OF THING?

19:06.680 --> 19:09.916
- SO, OKAY, SO THERE'S
AN ACTUAL STORY THAT TAKES PLACE

19:10.016 --> 19:12.452
FROM THE MORNING
ALL THE WAY TO THE NIGHT.

19:12.485 --> 19:16.322
MAYBE WE CAN DO, UM...

19:16.356 --> 19:17.323
MAYBE WE CAN DO A BOOK.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.925
- YEAH, MAYBE IT IS A BOOK.

19:19.025 --> 19:22.195
- HOW CAN WE BRING PEOPLE
INTO THE STORY?

19:28.601 --> 19:30.136
A NARRATOR
THAT'S NARRATING A STORY

19:30.170 --> 19:31.604
THAT WE'VE ALREADY WROTE
IN THE BOOK.

19:31.638 --> 19:32.839
- YEAH.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.174
- ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE
GOING TO MAIL THE BOOK.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.542
THEY'RE GOING TO READ
ABOUT THE BOOK.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.210
AFTER THEY COME TO THE EVENT,
THEY LIVE IN THE BOOK.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.045
WE PHYSICALLY TAKE THESE PEOPLE
INSIDE THAT STORY,

19:39.079 --> 19:41.247
INSIDE THAT WORLD
THAT WE'RE CREATING,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.782
SOMETHING
EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED.

19:42.816 --> 19:46.052
I'M TALKING, LIKE, BLACK TIE,
TUXEDOS, CHAMPAGNE, CAVIAR.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.488
- YEAH, THAT'S THE TALE
OF THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.156
- SO INSTEAD
OF A TYPICAL INVITATION,

19:50.190 --> 19:52.058
I'M GOING TO SEND A BOOK,
A HARDBOUND BOOK,

19:52.092 --> 19:54.260
THAT IS GOING TO INVITE PEOPLE
TO COME TO MY OPEN HOUSE.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.795
THE BOOK
IS GOING TO TELL A STORY.

19:55.829 --> 19:59.299
IT'S A FAIRY TALE OF WHAT IT IS
TO LIVE IN 30 LINCOLN PLAZA.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.600
- HOW ABOUT THIS--

20:00.633 --> 20:02.335
THE BOOK THAT WE GIVE THEM
DOESN'T HAVE AN ENDING?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.937
- YOU SIGN THE CONTRACTS,
THAT'S HOW IT ENDS.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.240
BUT I LIKE THAT. YES.
- RIGHT?

20:08.775 --> 20:10.844
- YOU COULD TURN IT INTO,
LIKE, ONE MASSIVE STRIPPER POLE.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.245
- I LIKE THAT.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.781
- HEY, SAM, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT A STRIP CLUB OWNER

20:14.814 --> 20:17.250
BUYING THE APARTMENT WHERE YOUR
BABIES TOOK THEIR FIRST STEPS?

20:17.283 --> 20:19.719
THUG LIFE.
THUG LIFE.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.694
[phone ringing]

20:27.727 --> 20:29.729
- THIS IS RYAN.
- HEY, RYAN. IT'S SAM.

20:29.763 --> 20:31.297
- HEY, SAM.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.400
I HOPE WE DIDN'T DESTROY
YOUR APARTMENT TOO MUCH

20:33.433 --> 20:34.434
AT THE OPEN HOUSE.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.003
IT WAS KIND OF CRAZY.

20:37.037 --> 20:38.271
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:55.155 --> 20:57.457
OF THE NEW APARTMENT?
THAT'S AWESOME.

21:08.168 --> 21:10.170
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT,
THOUGH?

21:10.203 --> 21:13.306
EVEN THOUGH
YOU MIGHT MOVE APARTMENTS,

21:13.340 --> 21:15.809
THE CHRYSLER BUILDING'S
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.182
I--
I TOTALLY GET IT.

21:22.215 --> 21:23.450
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.089
- WHY DON'T WE DO THIS,
'CAUSE I'VE ALREADY TOLD

21:29.089 --> 21:31.524
A FEW PEOPLE FROM
THE BROKERS OPEN

21:31.558 --> 21:33.727
THAT I WOULD SHOW IT TO THEM,

21:33.760 --> 21:36.730
SO WHY DON'T WE GET A COUPLE
OF THESE PEOPLE THROUGH,

21:36.763 --> 21:38.465
AND THEN WE CAN TALK?

21:44.437 --> 21:46.006
AWESOME.

21:46.106 --> 21:47.440
OLIVIA, I NEED YOU TO GET ME
THE NAMES

21:47.474 --> 21:49.242
AND THE PHONE NUMBERS
AND EMAILS FOR EVERYBODY

21:49.275 --> 21:50.276
THAT WAS AT THE BROKERS PARTY.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.411
- OKAY.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.946
- THE DRUG DEALER GUY
WITH THE GLASSES,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.547
THAT GUY, MAYBE HE'S GOT
A REAL GUY.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.749
GET HIM IN, EVERYBODY ELSE.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.550
EVERYBODY.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.288
[horn honks]

22:04.357 --> 22:06.459
- I AM TELLING THE STORY
OF WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE

22:06.493 --> 22:08.595
IN A MILSTEIN BUILDING
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.763
HELLO.
- HELLO!

22:09.796 --> 22:11.064
- HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- I'M AMY.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.566
- FIRST THINGS FIRST,
PRESENTATION.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.368
IN THE PAST, I HAVE DONE THINGS
A LITTLE CRAZY.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.504
I HAVE STAGED APARTMENTS
WITH POKER TABLES

22:17.537 --> 22:19.139
AND SMOKE
AND ALL KINDS OF CRAZY [bleep],

22:19.172 --> 22:21.307
BUT THIS YEAR,
IT'S NOT ABOUT MYSELF.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.776
IT'S ABOUT THE APARTMENTS.

22:22.809 --> 22:23.910
SO THE GUYS
ARE DOWNSTAIRS?

22:23.943 --> 22:25.178
- YES.
- YES, THEY'RE ALL SET TO GO.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.513
- OKAY, LET'S GET ROLLING.
- LET'S DO IT.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.314
- OKAY.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.315
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

22:29.349 --> 22:30.517
LUIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.618
I'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND
LATER.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.852
- I REVIEWED
THE STAGING COMPANY'S

22:32.886 --> 22:34.320
INVENTORY BEFOREHAND...

22:34.354 --> 22:35.789
ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING
THE OTHER ONE IN.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.991
AND I SPECIFICALLY HANDPICKED
EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE...

22:38.091 --> 22:39.793
ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU MOVE THAT
TO THE RIGHT, PLEASE?

22:39.826 --> 22:40.827
BEAUTIFUL.

22:40.860 --> 22:41.928
- TO MAKE SURE
THAT I CREATED

22:41.961 --> 22:43.697
THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
AND ELEGANT LOOK

22:43.730 --> 22:44.898
I COULD POSSIBLY MAKE.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.599
LISTEN, GUYS,
IF YOU NEED HELP, I CAN HELP.

22:46.633 --> 22:47.934
- NO, NO, WE'RE GOOD.
- WE'RE GOOD.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.202
- OKAY.

22:49.235 --> 22:51.204
THIS YEAR, I AM TRYING
TO FOCUS ALL OF MY ENERGY,

22:51.237 --> 22:53.106
BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM--

22:53.139 --> 22:56.543
IT'S JUST I LOVE REAL ESTATE,
YOU KNOW?

22:56.576 --> 22:59.212
I CAN'T CONTAIN MYSELF.
I'M EXCITED.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.680
YOU KNOW, IT'S EXCITING.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.350
[funky music]

23:03.383 --> 23:05.352
BRING IT HERE, PLEASE.
BRING IT OVER HERE.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.054
OH, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL COUCH.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.057
[horn honks]

23:13.893 --> 23:16.262
OH, MY GOD!

23:16.296 --> 23:17.464
- YOU LIKE IT?

23:17.497 --> 23:19.332
- OH, MY GOD.

23:19.366 --> 23:20.567
THIS IS AMAZING, GUYS.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.968
I LIKE VERY, VERY MUCH.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.503
- GREAT.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.876
- THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT,
VERY GRAND.

23:31.344 --> 23:34.514
NOW I JUST HAVE TO LET THE WORLD
KNOW ABOUT THIS APARTMENT.

23:36.349 --> 23:37.317
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, GUYS!

23:37.350 --> 23:38.685
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

23:38.718 --> 23:41.554
OKAY.
NOW LET'S SELL THIS PLACE.

23:47.227 --> 23:50.530
[knocking on door]

23:50.563 --> 23:51.564
- HI!
- HELLO.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.866
- HI. RYAN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

23:52.899 --> 23:53.900
- THE SAME.
- RYAN.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.101
- HELLO.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.903
- LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BRIGHT OUTSIDE, HUH?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.104
- HOW YOU DOING?

23:58.104 --> 23:59.572
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
OUTSIDE, SUNNY.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.607
- YES.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.775
YOUR NAME IS?

24:01.808 --> 24:02.776
- PABLO.
- PABLO?

24:02.809 --> 24:04.210
- YES, SIR.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:04.244 --> 24:07.580
WE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU
AT A BROKERS OPEN HOUSE.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.815
- I HAVE A COUPLE CLIENTS,

24:08.848 --> 24:11.551
AND ONE OF THEM IS THE SON
OF A DRUG DEALER.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.287
- YES.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.256
YES, ACTUALLY.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.091
JUST BEFORE WE START,
'CAUSE I'M GOING TO THINK

24:18.124 --> 24:19.092
ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME,

24:19.125 --> 24:20.160
YOU HAVE A TATTOO ON YOUR HEAD,
HUH?

24:20.193 --> 24:21.361
- IT TALKS TO ME SOMETIMES.

24:21.394 --> 24:24.864
- I HAVE THE SAME THING,
BUT I GREW MY HAIR OUT.

24:24.898 --> 24:25.965
- YEAH.

24:26.066 --> 24:27.267
- WHAT DO YOU DO?

24:27.300 --> 24:28.802
- ENTERTAINMENT.
- ENTERTAINMENT?

24:28.835 --> 24:30.570
ME TOO, WITH REAL ESTATE.

24:30.603 --> 24:33.206
- YEAH, I DO IT
WITH STRIP CLUBS.

24:33.239 --> 24:36.109
- I LIKE YOU ALREADY.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.178
SO THIS IS THE FIRST PENTHOUSE
THAT HAS HIT THE MARKET

24:38.211 --> 24:39.779
SINCE THE BUILDING
FIRST CAME TO MARKET.

24:39.813 --> 24:42.615
IT'S A LITTLE OVER 2,500
SQUARE FEET INTERIOR,

24:42.649 --> 24:46.119
AND YOU COULD TURN THAT THING,
INSTEAD OF A NICE, SQUARE BOX,

24:46.152 --> 24:48.621
YOU COULD TURN IT INTO, LIKE,
ONE MASSIVE STRIPPER POLE.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.323
- I LIKE THAT.

24:50.357 --> 24:53.360
- SOMETIMES YOU NEVER KNOW
WHO YOUR CLIENT'S GOING TO BE.

24:53.393 --> 24:57.364
I MEAN, I ONCE SOLD AN APARTMENT
IN BATTERY PARK TO A MADAM.

24:57.397 --> 24:59.165
THE OWNERS HERE
HAVE KIDS.

24:59.199 --> 25:00.734
DO YOU HAVE KIDS YET?
- I HAVE A DAUGHTER.

25:00.767 --> 25:01.901
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

25:01.935 --> 25:02.902
- SHE DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU,
DOES SHE?

25:02.936 --> 25:03.903
- NO.
- JUST KIDDING!

25:03.937 --> 25:05.438
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

25:05.472 --> 25:07.340
- NAH, SHE'S EIGHT YEARS OLD,
SO SHE'S STILL TOO YOUNG.

25:07.374 --> 25:09.709
- OH, THAT WOULD BE
REALLY WEIRD.

25:09.743 --> 25:11.344
SO THIS IS YOUR TERRACE.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.082
FACING DIRECTLY SOUTH AND EAST,

25:16.116 --> 25:18.284
AND IT'S COOL TOO,
FOR ENTERTAINING, YOU KNOW?

25:18.318 --> 25:19.586
- I WANT TO SEE
WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.054
- YEAH,
LET'S GO AROUND THIS WAY,

25:21.054 --> 25:22.555
SO YOU CAN WALK
INTO THE MASTER BEDROOM

25:22.589 --> 25:25.925
THE WAY YOU WOULD,
MAKING MAGIC.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.429
SO THIS IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM, ALL RIGHT?

25:29.462 --> 25:31.398
IT'S ALL ABOUT VIEWS.

25:32.766 --> 25:34.334
- I ACTUALLY WAS THINKING
OF TURNING THIS

25:34.367 --> 25:37.070
INTO A CHAMPAGNE ROOM.

25:37.070 --> 25:38.071
- THUG LIFE.

25:38.071 --> 25:40.607
- EXACTLY.
- THUG LIFE.

25:42.075 --> 25:44.377
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THE LOOK ON SAM'S FACE.

25:44.411 --> 25:46.079
"HEY, SAM,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

25:46.112 --> 25:49.249
"A TATTOOED STRIP CLUB OWNER
BUYING THE APARTMENT

25:49.282 --> 25:50.950
WHERE YOUR BABIES
TOOK THEIR FIRST STEPS?"

25:50.984 --> 25:52.352
- LET ME TALK
FOR A SECOND WITH RYAN.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.820
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, MAN.
- NO PROBLEM, MAN.

25:53.853 --> 25:54.954
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THANK YOU TOO.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.222
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

25:56.256 --> 25:57.757
- I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH.

25:57.791 --> 25:58.825
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YES.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.126
- WHAT ELSE CAN YOU FIND
OUT THERE

26:00.160 --> 26:02.595
FOR 6 1/2
THAT'S LIKE THIS?

26:02.629 --> 26:04.831
NOTHING.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.132
SO IF HE'S INTERESTED,
YOU KNOW,

26:06.166 --> 26:07.734
I THINK WE SHOULD BRING HIM BACK
AT NIGHT.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.769
GO FROM THERE.
- OKAY.

26:09.803 --> 26:11.638
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
WEAR SUNGLASSES ALL THE TIME.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.872
YOU HAVE
SUCH NICE BLUE EYES.

26:12.906 --> 26:15.675
- IT PROTECTS MY EYES.
- I LIKE IT.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.317
- IT SMELLS LIKE
JURASSIC PARK IN HERE.

26:24.351 --> 26:25.518
HI, I'M FREDRIK.

26:25.552 --> 26:26.720

26:27.754 --> 26:29.389

WITH PARROTS IN AFRICA.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.390
HE LOVES THEM.

26:30.423 --> 26:33.059
MY HUSBAND
LOVES PARROTS.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.627
I'M NOT SO CONVINCED YET,

26:34.661 --> 26:37.063
BUT DO YOU HAVE
ANY PARROTS HERE?

26:37.097 --> 26:38.465
- WE DO.
WE HAVE LOTS.

26:38.498 --> 26:42.068
[birds chirping]

26:42.102 --> 26:47.107
[birds screeching]

26:47.140 --> 26:49.309
- WHY IS HE SCREAMING SO MUCH?
HI, BIRDIE.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.644
[bird screeching]

26:51.678 --> 26:53.580
I MEAN, THAT NOISE...

26:55.982 --> 26:58.318
[screeching]

26:58.351 --> 27:00.220

27:00.253 --> 27:02.022
- AND THEY ACTUALLY PICK UP
ON A LOT OF THINGS,

27:02.022 --> 27:03.423
LIKE OUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS,
SO...

27:03.456 --> 27:05.392
[cell phone ringing]

27:05.425 --> 27:08.728
WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT'S THAT?

27:08.762 --> 27:10.730
WHAT IS THAT?

27:10.764 --> 27:11.765
- HE DOESN'T LIKE YOUR SONG.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.600
- SORRY, BABY,
THIS IS 16 WARREN.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.136
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

27:18.605 --> 27:19.673
- HI, JACK.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.408
JACK IS A BROKER
REPRESENTING A BUYER

27:21.441 --> 27:23.777
WHO'S AWARE
OF THE SCAFFOLDING ISSUE

27:23.810 --> 27:26.046
AND STILL WANTS TO PUT IN
AN OFFER.

27:26.046 --> 27:28.214
I'M HOPING
THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

27:28.248 --> 27:31.751
SO I HEAR THAT
YOU LIKE 16 WARREN.

27:34.354 --> 27:36.723
- 5 1/2 IS EXPENSIVE?
I THINK IT'S A STEAL.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.191
IT'S STILL
ALMOST 3,500 SQUARE FEET

27:38.224 --> 27:39.793
PLUS THE FOUR TERRACES.

27:55.709 --> 27:58.078
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO, JACK, JACK, JACK.

27:58.078 --> 27:59.813
4.850 IS A RIDICULOUS NUMBER.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.147
YOU KNOW THAT
AS WELL AS I DO.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.849
IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW,
AFTER CONSTRUCTION,

28:02.882 --> 28:05.352
AFTER SCAFFOLDING IS GONE,
NORTHEAST TRIBECA

28:05.385 --> 28:07.120
IS GOING TO BE THE HOTTEST AREA.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.022
THIS IS GOING TO BE
AT LEAST 2,000 A FOOT.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.291
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT 7 1/2 MILLION EASILY.

28:11.324 --> 28:12.492
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO COME UP.

28:12.525 --> 28:13.760
IT HAS TO HAVE A 5
IN FRONT OF IT.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.197
OH, GOD.

28:17.230 --> 28:19.399
I MEANT 5,
LIKE, IN FRONT OF IT.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.073
I'LL PRESENT THIS,

28:27.107 --> 28:29.542
BUT LET ME
CALL YOU BACK LATER.

28:29.576 --> 28:33.413
A LOW OFFER, 4.850,
IT BRINGS UP TWO FEELINGS IN ME:

28:33.446 --> 28:36.116
ONE, [bleep].

28:36.149 --> 28:38.618
JOEL'S GOING TO KILL ME.
THE OTHER ONE IS, GREAT.

28:38.651 --> 28:40.220
TRUTHFULLY,
I THINK IT'S THE FIRST OFFER

28:40.253 --> 28:41.721
THIS PROPERTY EVER HAD.

28:43.256 --> 28:46.092
[phone line ringing]

28:46.126 --> 28:47.594

28:47.627 --> 28:49.295
- HI, JOEL.
THIS IS FREDRIK.

28:49.329 --> 28:50.530
I HAVE REALLY GOOD NEWS.

28:50.563 --> 28:53.700
REGARDLESS OF SCAFFOLDING
AND HIGH MONTHLIES,

28:53.733 --> 28:56.836
AND ALL OF THAT STUFF,
I HAVE GOTTEN AN OFFER,

28:56.870 --> 29:01.541

29:07.814 --> 29:09.516
NO, I'M NOT CRAZY.
I'M YOUR BROKER.

29:09.549 --> 29:11.484
I'M A REALLY
CRAZY-GOOD BROKER.

29:15.588 --> 29:19.292
YEAH, WE'RE GOING
TO END UP CLOSER--

29:19.325 --> 29:21.494
JOEL, WE'RE GOING

AAH!

29:23.797 --> 29:25.065
WE'RE GOING TO END UP--

29:25.098 --> 29:26.766
WE'RE GOING TO END UP CLOSER
TO 5.5,

29:26.800 --> 29:28.168
BUT WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.336
WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO TELL THEM?

29:29.369 --> 29:31.504
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?

29:39.045 --> 29:40.380
UGH!

29:40.413 --> 29:42.549
EACH CHALLENGING PROPERTY
IS LIKE AN OPPONENT FOR ME.

29:42.582 --> 29:43.883
IT'S LIKE A BOXING RING.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.552
HE'S HITTING ME--
BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM--

29:45.585 --> 29:47.287
LEFT AND RIGHT,
AND I'M NOT USED TO THAT.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.590
USUALLY, I GO BOOM,
ON THE FIRST HIT,

29:50.623 --> 29:52.759
BUT I THINK
I JUST GOT KNOCKED OUT.

29:54.361 --> 29:56.730
[bird screeches]

29:56.763 --> 29:58.698
NO OTHER BROKER
CAN GET THIS DONE FOR YOU.

29:58.732 --> 29:59.733
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON, HANG ON.

29:59.766 --> 30:01.401
- YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW!
- NO, NO.

30:01.434 --> 30:02.569
- THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

30:02.602 --> 30:04.037
YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO THE PROFESSIONAL HERE.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.706
ALL THAT WORK
THAT I PUT INTO IT IS GONE.

30:12.445 --> 30:14.781
- BABE,
COME AND DANCE WITH ME.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.783
- NO, I CAN'T DANCE.

30:16.816 --> 30:19.085
- COME AND DANCE WITH ME.
WE NEVER DANCE.

30:19.119 --> 30:21.087
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
FROM MY CHILDHOOD

30:21.121 --> 30:24.424
IS TO DANCE WHAT
WE CALL THE "LITTLE FROG" DANCE.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.326
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE
A FERTILITY SONG.

30:26.359 --> 30:29.162
WE DANCE AROUND THE POLE,
PRETENDING WE'RE LITTLE FROGS,

30:29.195 --> 30:31.331
AND THE POLE IS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE...

30:31.364 --> 30:32.332
[squeaks]

30:32.365 --> 30:33.733
PEE-PEE,

30:33.767 --> 30:35.769
AND THEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO HOLD MY TAIL,

30:35.802 --> 30:37.070
WHICH YOU KNOW HOW TO DO.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.439
- WAIT,
YOU'RE NOT A FROG THEN.

30:39.472 --> 30:41.007
- BUT YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE IT.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.409
OTHERWISE,
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

30:42.442 --> 30:44.110
[singing in Swedish]

30:44.144 --> 30:45.845

30:53.253 --> 30:54.220

A SWEDISH FROG.

30:58.658 --> 30:59.826
IT'S YOUR TURN.
SHOW ME.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.528

31:01.561 --> 31:03.930
- YES, YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
AT BEING THE BIG POLE.

31:13.907 --> 31:15.442
- WHAT UP, BEANIE?

31:15.475 --> 31:16.576
- HERE.

31:16.609 --> 31:17.610
- A PACKAGE CAME.

31:22.349 --> 31:24.417

31:24.451 --> 31:26.486

31:29.756 --> 31:33.426
WHAT IS THIS?

- RYAN...
- SERIOUSLY.

31:43.536 --> 31:45.405
- I HATE WHEN YOU SAY STUFF
LIKE THAT.

31:45.438 --> 31:46.473
- HE IS PUERTO RICAN.

31:46.506 --> 31:47.574
- YOU CAN JUST CALL HIM
BY HIS NAME.

31:47.607 --> 31:48.575
HOW ABOUT THAT?

31:48.608 --> 31:50.176
- WHY DID HE SEND ME--

31:50.210 --> 31:54.881
30 LINCOLN PLAZA
AND ITS OPEN HOUSE ON MONDAY.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.884
OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
LAME.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.153
I DON'T WANT TO GO BECAUSE
THERE'S--HE SENDS ME A BOOK.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.454
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH THIS?

32:01.488 --> 32:03.623
- YOU SHOULD RESPECT IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:03.656 --> 32:04.791
- HE'S TRYING
TO BE INNOVATIVE.

32:04.824 --> 32:06.292
HE'S TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

32:06.326 --> 32:07.827
- HE'S TRYING TO BE INNOVATIVE
BY SENDING SOMEONE A BOOK?

32:07.861 --> 32:09.162
NO. WHAT?

32:09.195 --> 32:12.465
- DID YOU EVEN READ
ONE WORD OF THIS?

32:12.499 --> 32:15.135
THIS IS NICE.
HE'S TRYING TO TELL A STORY.

32:15.168 --> 32:17.070
- YOU KNOW, HE COULD HAVE JUST
EMAILED THIS TO ME.

32:17.070 --> 32:19.239
YOU KNOW HOW MANY TREES
HE JUST KILLED?

32:19.272 --> 32:20.306
HE'S NOT GREEN.

32:20.340 --> 32:23.309
I AM GREEN.

32:24.577 --> 32:26.746
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.148
THERE'S SOMETHING
OLD-FASHIONED

32:28.181 --> 32:30.083
ABOUT SENDING AN ACTUAL BOOK.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.952
- I CAN PUT IT
ONTO MY BOOKSHELF?

32:32.986 --> 32:34.754
- PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT
ON THEIR TABLES,

32:34.788 --> 32:36.089
ON THEIR COFFEE TABLES.
- NO ONE READS BOOKS ANYMORE.

32:36.089 --> 32:37.624
DOES HE NOT HAVE, LIKE,
AN IPAD OR A TABLET?

32:37.657 --> 32:38.758
HE NEEDS TO DO MORE DEALS,

32:38.792 --> 32:40.293
SO HE CAN AFFORD
MODERN-DAY TECHNOLOGY.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.327
- AT LEAST HE READS.

32:41.361 --> 32:42.662
- ACTUALLY, COULD YOU
SEND IT BACK

32:42.696 --> 32:45.098
AND ASK HIM TO HAVE IT PUT
ON AN AUDIBLE,

32:45.131 --> 32:46.599
SO I CAN HAVE A BOOK ON TAPE?

32:46.633 --> 32:47.701
- NO.

32:47.734 --> 32:50.303
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
ARE YOU GOING TO GO?

32:53.273 --> 32:56.242
- OKAY.
THEN IT WORKED.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.383
- OH, THE WORM FACTORY.

33:20.333 --> 33:22.702
IT'S BETTER

33:22.736 --> 33:24.137
JOEL ISN'T GOING TO BE HAPPY

33:24.170 --> 33:27.907
SO I'VE BROUGHT

THIS CONVERSATION?

34:05.745 --> 34:07.847
WE AGREED TO LOWER

IS GOING TO BE COVERED.

34:18.925 --> 34:21.528
- LISTEN, LISTEN, ANYBODY
KNOWS THAT IF YOU'RE PATIENT,

34:21.561 --> 34:25.398
AND YOU WAIT TWO YEARS,
THIS IS A BONANZA.

34:25.432 --> 34:27.667
YOU'VE GOT TO BRING ME
SOMETHING CLOSE--

34:27.701 --> 34:29.069
- JOEL, I'M BRINGING YOU
THE BEST--

34:29.102 --> 34:30.403
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
I'VE GONE THROUGH WITH THEM.

34:30.437 --> 34:32.572
NO OTHER BROKER
CAN GET THIS DONE FOR YOU.

34:32.605 --> 34:33.573
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HANG ON, HANG ON, HANG ON.

34:33.606 --> 34:34.741
- LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

34:34.774 --> 34:35.942
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- LET ME EXPLAIN.

34:35.975 --> 34:37.077
YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW!
- NO, NO.

34:37.110 --> 34:39.179
- LISTEN TO ME!
- NO, NO. REMEMBER WHEN--

34:39.212 --> 34:40.347
- THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.948
YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO THE PROFESSIONAL HERE.

34:41.981 --> 34:42.949
- PROFESSIONAL?
- YES.

34:42.982 --> 34:44.718
- OKAY,
WHERE IS MY ASKING PRICE?

34:44.751 --> 34:47.354
WHERE IS IT?
- FORGET THE ASKING PRICE!

34:47.387 --> 34:49.356
THE ASKING PRICE
WAS BEFORE THE SCAFFOLDING!

34:49.389 --> 34:50.724
- YOU CAN'T BLAME IT ON ME...
- LISTEN TO ME, LISTEN TO ME.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.726
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO--
NO.

34:52.759 --> 34:54.728
COME ON, MAN.
DO SOMETHING.

34:54.761 --> 34:57.263
- [sighs]

34:57.297 --> 34:58.465
GIVE ME THE LOWEST NUMBER,

34:58.498 --> 35:00.066
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS NOT--

35:00.100 --> 35:01.501
THIS DANCE BACK AND FORTH,

35:01.534 --> 35:03.169
THESE WORMS,
THE SCAFFOLDING,

35:03.203 --> 35:04.604
ALL OF THIS
IS NOT GOING TO WORK OUT.

35:04.637 --> 35:06.473
YOU'RE NOT MOVING.

35:06.506 --> 35:09.242
YOU GOT TO FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER BROKER.

35:11.077 --> 35:14.147
- I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
MY BOTTOM, BOTTOM PRICE,

35:14.180 --> 35:16.850
AND THAT WILL BE IT--

35:16.883 --> 35:19.419
5,350,000.

35:19.452 --> 35:21.254
- OOH.
- NOT ONE PENNY LESS.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.922
- I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THAT.

35:22.956 --> 35:24.357
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

35:24.391 --> 35:27.160
IF THEY DON'T TAKE
THIS LOWEST OFFER OF 5.350,

35:27.193 --> 35:28.161
IT'S OVER.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.562
JOEL IS TAKING IT
OFF THE MARKET,

35:29.596 --> 35:32.065
AND ALL THAT WORK
THAT I PUT INTO IT IS GONE,

35:32.098 --> 35:33.299
EVAPORATES, ERASED.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.300
IT'S DONE.

35:34.334 --> 35:37.604
[phone line ringing]

35:37.637 --> 35:39.639
- YOU'VE REACHED JACK.
I'M UNAVAILABLE.

35:39.673 --> 35:41.341
- AT THE TONE,
PLEASE RECORD YOUR MESSAGE.

35:41.374 --> 35:42.342
[beep]

35:42.375 --> 35:44.077
- HI, JACK.
IT'S FREDRIK.

35:44.110 --> 35:47.147
I HAD A BIT OF A SCREAMING MATCH
WITH MY CLIENT JOEL--

35:47.180 --> 35:48.782
OH.

35:48.815 --> 35:51.551
HEADS WERE ROLLING
ON THE GROUND, LITERALLY,

35:51.584 --> 35:54.320
BUT THE LOWEST NUMBER
HE'LL TAKE--

35:54.354 --> 35:56.623
5.350.

35:56.656 --> 35:58.692
YOU GO TO YOUR CLIENT,
AND YOU CONVINCE HIM.

35:58.725 --> 36:01.261
CALL ME BACK.

36:03.363 --> 36:09.035
ALL WE CAN DO NOW IS WAIT
AND PRAY.

36:09.035 --> 36:10.770
- ARE YOU COLD
OR SOMETHING?

36:10.804 --> 36:13.773
- NERVOUS.

36:18.945 --> 36:20.747
- DO YOU--ARE YOU COLD?
DO YOU WANT TO--

36:20.780 --> 36:22.515
- NO, I'M NOT COLD.
I'M FINE.

36:22.549 --> 36:24.417
- MM, WELL,
YOU MIGHT BE COLD SOON.

36:24.451 --> 36:26.086
THE SCAFFOLDING
IS COVERING THE SOLAR--

36:26.119 --> 36:27.654
[gasps]

36:29.089 --> 36:30.290
- LET ME SEE.

36:30.323 --> 36:32.692
- WHAT?

36:35.061 --> 36:36.763
"5.350 IS A GO.

36:36.796 --> 36:38.231
WAY TO GO, FREDDY."

36:38.264 --> 36:39.265
- ALL RIGHT!

36:39.299 --> 36:40.934
[cheering]

36:40.967 --> 36:42.569
- WAIT A MINUTE.

36:42.602 --> 36:47.140

THE CURSED PENTHOUSE, IS SOLD.

36:47.173 --> 36:48.975
I'VE DONE IT AGAIN!

36:49.075 --> 36:52.078

36:55.882 --> 36:56.950
- THERE HE IS.

36:56.983 --> 36:58.651
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- GREAT.

36:58.685 --> 37:00.220
- SO I HIRE AN ACTOR
TO READ THE BOOK

37:00.253 --> 37:01.554
THAT I SENT OUT
AS AN INVITATION.

37:01.588 --> 37:03.790
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S START
IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,

37:03.823 --> 37:05.759
AND LET'S PRETEND
THAT I'M YOUR BUYER.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.727
THIS ACTOR IS GOING
TO BRING THIS BOOK TO LIFE

37:07.761 --> 37:09.763
AND REALLY GIVE A SENSE
TO PEOPLE OF WHAT IT IS TO LIVE

37:09.796 --> 37:11.765
IN THE FANTASY
OF 30 LINCOLN PLAZA.

37:11.798 --> 37:14.701
- THE FIRST RAYS OF SUNLIGHT
BEGIN TO CASCADE

37:14.734 --> 37:17.203
INTO YOUR ROOM, ANNOUNCING
THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.371
- LET'S TRY IT
WITH AN ENGLISH ACCENT.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.472
CAN YOU DO
A BRITISH ACCENT?

37:19.506 --> 37:21.941
- AN ENTREPRENEUR,
A PHILANTHROPIST,

37:22.042 --> 37:24.277
WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU'RE THE BEST.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.445
- AN IRISH ACCENT.

37:25.478 --> 37:27.514
- CONSULTANT
OR A PHILANTHROPIST,

37:27.547 --> 37:28.848
ONE THING IS CERTAIN--

37:28.882 --> 37:30.417
YOU'RE A LEADER
AT THE TOP OF YOUR GAME.

37:30.450 --> 37:32.118
- LET'S TRY
A SPANISH ACCENT.

37:32.152 --> 37:33.219
- AY, PAPI, COME ON.

37:33.253 --> 37:34.654

37:34.688 --> 37:36.823
ALL RIGHT,
SO TELL ME WHY THIS PLACE,

37:36.856 --> 37:38.258
IT'S MEANT FOR ME?

37:38.291 --> 37:40.093
SELL ME ON THIS PLACE.

37:40.126 --> 37:43.863

PHILANTHROPIST, WHATEVER IT IS,

37:43.897 --> 37:45.131
YOU'RE THE BEST AT IT,

37:45.165 --> 37:47.934
AND YOU NEED A ROOM
THAT REFLECTS THAT ATTITUDE.

37:47.967 --> 37:49.202
- PEOPLE WANT TO BUY A FANTASY.

37:49.235 --> 37:50.570
THEY WANT TO BUY A DREAM,

37:50.603 --> 37:52.205
AND THAT'S THE REASON
THEY MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY.

37:52.238 --> 37:53.807
- YOU COULD SIT HERE,

37:53.840 --> 37:56.609
AND WORK FEELS
A LITTLE BIT LESS LIKE WORK.

37:56.643 --> 37:57.944
- IT'S ROMANTIC.
IT'S EMOTIONAL.

37:57.977 --> 37:59.646
THE MORE EMOTIONAL IT WILL BE
WHEN SOMEBODY

37:59.679 --> 38:01.147
WRITES A $7.8-MILLION CHECK.

38:01.181 --> 38:03.883
BOOM.

39:11.584 --> 39:13.253
EVERY SINGLE DAY,
THAT CLOCK IS TICKING,

39:13.286 --> 39:15.088
AND IT'S WEIGHING
ON MY SHOULDERS.

39:15.121 --> 39:17.390
I GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET THIS THING SOLD,

39:17.424 --> 39:19.059
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT HER
TO CHANGE HER MIND

39:19.092 --> 39:20.226
AND DECIDE TO RENT IT.

39:20.260 --> 39:23.129
OKAY, ALADINO MOVED ON,
SO NOW I HAVE NOBODY.

39:24.531 --> 39:25.565

NOTHING IS GOING TO MESS THIS UP
FOR ME.

I'VE EVER DONE.

39:52.926 --> 39:54.060
EVERYTHING NEEDS TO LOOK RIGHT.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.128
EVERYTHING NEEDS
TO TASTE RIGHT.

39:55.161 --> 39:56.529
EVERYTHING NEEDS
TO SOUND RIGHT.

39:56.563 --> 39:59.866
[classical music]

39:59.899 --> 40:01.167
EVERYTHING'S LOOKING GREAT.

40:01.201 --> 40:03.370
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING VERY SHARP,
SO LET'S GO!

40:03.403 --> 40:05.939
LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!

40:11.111 --> 40:12.312
IT'S NOT EVEN A PARTY.

40:12.345 --> 40:13.546
IT'S A GALA.

40:13.580 --> 40:16.182
IT'S A STORYBOOK BALL.

40:16.216 --> 40:18.151
IT'S A FAIRY TALE
BROUGHT TO LIFE.

40:19.786 --> 40:20.787
EVEN HOWARD LORBER,

40:20.820 --> 40:22.389
THE OWNER OF DOUGLAS ELLIMAN,
IS HERE.

40:22.422 --> 40:24.124
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CHANCE
FOR ME

40:24.157 --> 40:26.926
TO PROVE MYSELF TO A LOT
OF VERY IMPORTANT PEOPLE.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.030
[classical music,
people chattering]

40:32.065 --> 40:33.867
LUIS. NICE TO MEET YOU.
THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

40:33.900 --> 40:35.068

40:38.204 --> 40:39.639
IN THE COMMON SPACES
OF THE BUILDING

40:48.982 --> 40:50.116
YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN THE UNITS.

40:50.150 --> 40:51.551
I HAVE TO TAKE YOU DOWNSTAIRS
IN A LITTLE BIT.

40:51.584 --> 40:53.486
AND THEN I'M BRINGING
EVERYBODY DOWNSTAIRS IN GROUPS

40:53.520 --> 40:55.889
SO THAT THEY CAN EXPERIENCE
THE APARTMENT ON ITS OWN.

40:55.922 --> 40:57.190
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I THINK IS ONE

40:57.223 --> 41:00.660
OF THE MOST AMAZING APARTMENTS
IN THE UPPER WEST SIDE.

41:00.694 --> 41:02.062
- WELCOME,
