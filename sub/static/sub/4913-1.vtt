Currently looking at a fresh candles. It smells good.

07:32.396 --> 07:35.696
Gus, you had it last.

07:36.197 --> 07:40.097
Never mind, we'll find him. Mrs. Bing wants her brooch as soon as possible.

07:40.198 --> 07:43.198
Can you handle it? -Mrs. Bing?

07:43.359 --> 07:46.599
A lady who used too much perfume.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.500
I do not know. Do not worry, you will know when namirišeš.

07:50.901 --> 07:54.201

07:54.302 --> 07:58.502

I need you.

08:04.704 --> 08:08.000

08:12.002 --> 08:14.602
stupid car blocked ...

08:14.747 --> 08:17.603
If we at least one thing went right.

08:18.004 --> 08:22.504
All right. How? -Jolene, I can not borrow from you again!

08:22.905 --> 08:25.505
Let me at least help restore the car back.

08:25.650 --> 08:28.006
How much?

08:30.291 --> 08:34.140
Old sentence, new sentence, remove the padlock with rubber ...

08:34.241 --> 08:37.642
Around $ 175. Nearly 200!

08:41.443 --> 08:43.940
Here you go. -I'll come back.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.041
I know.

08:46.242 --> 08:49.542
How's it going with that legacy?

08:49.543 --> 08:54.143
Impossible mission. I wonder if all that lost the case.

08:55.144 --> 08:58.344
I live in a different way.

08:58.545 --> 09:02.845
Starting from today! I'll take care of you financial situation,

That's it!

09:09.248 --> 09:12.348
For a change, the next time Find NEKON decent and precious.

09:12.449 --> 09:15.549
He's out there somewhere. -Jolene, nobody knows

09:15.550 --> 09:18.850
you're a good person. Because we are roommates.

09:18.951 --> 09:22.151
Because you are totally mistaken.

09:32.252 --> 09:34.448
Hey, Gus!

09:34.549 --> 09:37.749
Bye. I'm Bernadette, this is Max.

09:43.852 --> 09:46.452
Let Gus alone.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.853
Can we bring back those $ 5 you owe me?

09:50.954 --> 09:53.850
You do not owe him anything! How many times do you have to say?

09:53.951 --> 09:57.451

10:22.551 --> 10:25.747
My dear, where are you?

10:43.108 --> 10:45.344
Venus.

10:45.545 --> 10:48.445
If you do not use social networks, why not use it?

10:48.546 --> 10:51.846
Where are your sites, blogs? Do you know how to present

10:51.897 --> 10:55.147
Twitter, Yelp, conduct a Google? The possibilities are endless

10:55.248 --> 10:58.948
and the point is that if you do not know today how to keep your small business

10:59.049 --> 11:01.549
then do not open.

11:01.650 --> 11:04.750
I want to make a plan. It is your task to Monday.

11:04.900 --> 11:07.251
Tell me your plan. You understand?

11:08.252 --> 11:11.852
If you want an example, you can download it from the website.

11:12.553 --> 11:17.453
I now look at some fresh flowers. It smells good. </ I>

11:17.654 --> 11:20.454
I wonder what kind </ i>

11:20.655 --> 11:24.655

11:24.856 --> 11:31.057
Hey, you do not know me and believe me, I'd never do anything like that. </ i>

11:31.258 --> 11:34.658

11:50.462 --> 11:53.462
I with Jerry talks focused on Molly </ i>

11:53.463 --> 11:57.063
I do not want to discourage. Cvjeæarnica is a good idea

11:57.064 --> 12:00.964
vision but are not well targeted. Think about the competition in the city.

12:00.965 --> 12:05.265
I do not want to throw in something from just anything you will not be able to get away.

12:05.366 --> 12:08.266
What do you know about your intention? Why cvjeæarnica?

12:08.467 --> 12:11.267
Sometimes children make a wish staring at the stars.

12:11.368 --> 12:12.968
I do it trgajuæi petals.

12:13.069 --> 12:16.469
Arranging bouquets someone can brighten your day.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.069
I know that it is not ambitious.

12:19.270 --> 12:24.370
But you is ambitious. Therefore honor it and organize it.

12:55.468 --> 12:58.464
Hi! Good morning!

12:58.665 --> 13:01.465
Glad to see you!

13:02.566 --> 13:05.762
You're late minute!

13:26.663 --> 13:29.061

13:31.590 --> 13:35.460
You want me to come to you? I do not. There's no need. </ I>

13:36.561 --> 13:41.361
Lucy, this is why I moved from California to New Orleans?

13:41.496 --> 13:45.362
Yes, in order to be in a familiar environment. And that I can be with you

13:45.563 --> 13:49.063
whenever you need me. And Jerry.

13:49.264 --> 13:53.664
Thank you for helping me to handle this all in. ..

13:55.665 --> 13:59.161
Helping me. I-What are sisters for? </ i>

13:59.262 --> 14:02.162
Or I Venus </ i>

14:02.293 --> 14:06.863
I wish you a nice day, a nice life. My name is Molly. </ I>

14:07.264 --> 14:11.664
Remember Suzy Watkins from the 5th Grades? She gave you a gift for Valentine's Day.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.865
What does that have to do with .. Or Lily Gazinski, 8th Grades?

14:14.966 --> 14:17.966
She invited you to a little graduation. I had the chance!

14:18.120 --> 14:21.499
Until you have moved to California. 12 years I've watched

14:21.500 --> 14:25.968
how these women fall into your lap. And I? I've always watched TV with popcorn

14:25.969 --> 14:29.469
and my sister. And then I even had a flat stomach.

14:29.570 --> 14:32.970
Even you and Brenda liked more than me.

14:33.371 --> 14:37.271
Who is Molly? Yes, Molly.

14:37.572 --> 14:41.372
I'd say that's a good girl, probably not very much.

14:41.573 --> 14:45.473
Sensitive, generous, with a strange sense of curiosity.

14:45.574 --> 14:48.874
What luðakinja leaves messages to strangers? How do you it seems?

14:48.875 --> 14:52.175
I love it. Just you.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.176
Waiting for my clients and the case that I get.

14:57.077 --> 15:00.077
Come on now! Go! Okay, I'm going.

15:00.278 --> 15:02.878
Yes, go now.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.375
Sorry! -Oh my God!

15:15.576 --> 15:18.376
Sorry, I did not mean to scare you.

15:18.577 --> 15:21.377
Hi, I did not know that you're doing here.

15:21.578 --> 15:24.178
I am. Do you remember me?

15:24.329 --> 15:27.379
You Gus, do not you? I've been waiting for you.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.280
Sorry if I scared the other day. It was one of those days.

15:31.481 --> 15:35.381
In fact, today I was such a day. I sold it.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.082
Pretty expensive. I got it as a gift.

15:39.183 --> 15:42.883
I'm broke so I will accept half of its value.

15:43.384 --> 15:47.984
I'm sorry, but today I can not help it. Then tomorrow? You tell.

15:49.085 --> 15:52.985
No, not really.

15:53.086 --> 15:57.486
Why? Because it is false.

15:58.087 --> 16:01.287
Impossible! -Come, I'll show you.

16:02.288 --> 16:05.288
Let's see. Yes, right there.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.889
Original. Yours.

16:07.990 --> 16:10.790
First, you can feel by touch.

16:10.891 --> 16:15.591
Then you can feel the difference in weight.

16:15.792 --> 16:22.793
And last, the original label that unfortunately out of your way.

16:23.094 --> 16:25.744
Of course! -I'm sorry. Are you okay?

16:25.945 --> 16:28.745
Junk lying fool!

16:30.446 --> 16:33.746

16:53.051 --> 16:56.451
Half kamenèiæa missing. -Yes.

16:56.752 --> 17:00.852
Nevertheless it is very nice. And there are many kamenèiæa in it.

17:01.053 --> 17:03.753
It belonged to my aunt.

17:03.954 --> 17:06.954
She has good taste.

17:07.155 --> 17:09.655
Definitely.

17:09.856 --> 17:13.556
It is a Victorian ring, rarely can find them.

17:17.007 --> 17:20.252
$ 50.

17:21.854 --> 17:25.650
I can not pay that much. Value-at least 50

17:26.451 --> 17:30.051
I think ... I need money.

17:34.352 --> 17:36.948
Here you go.

17:39.349 --> 17:43.645
$ 200? I told 50 -Worth more than 50

17:43.846 --> 17:47.042
No way you can pay less.

17:48.843 --> 17:52.339
I've lived here three years already. I changed two cars,

17:52.540 --> 17:56.340
four apartments, three boy and met countless strangers

17:56.641 --> 18:00.541
and this is one of the most beautiful things that someone did for me.

18:50.036 --> 18:53.936
Drag and bastard and, agreeable and dangerous ... How are you dear?

18:53.937 --> 18:55.937
I think I have a good assessment.

18:56.138 --> 19:00.238
Molly! What? I'm just nice to kind boyfriend.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.339
What's wrong with that? -Take the floral pattern.

19:03.490 --> 19:06.940
In it, you look desperately.

19:20.601 --> 19:23.407
Hi, Sam.

19:23.558 --> 19:27.608
I was looking for, but I think I've never seen a blue diamond.

19:27.609 --> 19:29.309
Gus, we need to find him.

19:29.410 --> 19:32.410
This just came. Someone pushed under the door.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.107
I Dear Gus, thank you for noticing the flowers. You've made my day. Molly. </ I>

19:57.208 --> 20:01.804

20:02.050 --> 20:05.501
Literally and stalking. Send her a message or a call.

20:05.652 --> 20:07.027

send a postcard, you would still need to know?

20:12.204 --> 20:13.570
What else do I need to know?

20:13.605 --> 20:17.905
You had an aneurysm, lost pamæenje, you have suffered a lot.

20:17.906 --> 20:19.606
Be thankful you're still alive.

20:19.607 --> 20:24.507
And to remember the important things before the nervous breakdown. Like me.

20:24.608 --> 20:27.508
Gus, you're not living. We are all experienced trauma.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.709
I am a divorced woman with whom I thought I spend my life.

20:30.860 --> 20:34.410
I know it's not the same, but the call went out. What bad could happen?

20:34.511 --> 20:38.011
Wait ... You and Brenda're divorced?

20:38.212 --> 20:41.712
Yes! Will you go over? You're ruining my lunch.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.709
Hi Molly, Gus here.

20:58.210 --> 21:01.310
I Hi, you've Jolene. And Molly. Saèekajte signal. </ I>

21:01.411 --> 21:04.711

21:09.413 --> 21:15.343

21:21.345 --> 21:28.546
I night. I meant to go to dinner </ i> somewhere.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.047
Perhaps the Cafe Amelie.

21:32.148 --> 21:35.548
They have delicious food.

21:36.349 --> 21:40.449
I If it fits in 19:30 </ i> Meet me there.

21:40.650 --> 21:44.250
To reiterate, here Gus Gillenwater.

21:46.051 --> 21:48.651
Okay, bye.

22:01.302 --> 22:06.448
I Make Payment salaries. And at 19:30 you have a date with Molly Cafe Amelie. </ I>

22:17.549 --> 22:21.945
I Gus? Gus </ i> Hi, stay there.

22:21.946 --> 22:24.846
Hello? -Gus?

22:25.947 --> 22:29.347
Is that you? Bernadette.

22:29.448 --> 22:32.548
My son Max and I live upstairs.

22:34.449 --> 22:38.245
Thank God! That's better.

22:39.046 --> 22:43.146
Sorry, I have problems with memory.

22:43.647 --> 22:46.847
If you again, I asked for the name ... Good going, Gus.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.548
Do you need something?

22:49.849 --> 22:53.649
No, I think not. -Good. Good night.

22:53.750 --> 22:58.350
Good night. -Max? Hi, what are you doing?

23:25.746 --> 23:28.446
Molly?

23:30.747 --> 23:33.743
Where's Molly? -In the back.

23:34.444 --> 23:37.344
Molly!

23:37.445 --> 23:40.345
Molly! Yeah? What are you doing?

23:40.346 --> 23:44.346
I finished. Check the schedule. I work until 19:00. I have a meeting.

23:44.647 --> 23:48.147
Oh, I'm sorry. Compound?

23:48.348 --> 23:52.148
Hard to believe, but yes. -Is it a good boy?

23:52.249 --> 23:56.249
I think so. You're a pretty girl, Molly.

23:56.950 --> 24:00.750
And dear. Irresponsible, but nice.

24:00.851 --> 24:03.551
're Worth. Someday ...

24:03.700 --> 24:07.152
Blurs my mirror. -You look good.

24:07.353 --> 24:10.153
Thank you.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.297
I Hi, Jerry. </ i> Is' ugly?

24:33.398 --> 24:36.398
Do not hang up, just say yes or no.

24:37.999 --> 24:40.495
I Gus, where are you? </ i>

24:40.696 --> 24:43.296
I at home. </ i> Is you serious?

24:43.397 --> 24:46.297
I knew it! I Why are you home? </ i> That's why I live here.

24:46.398 --> 24:49.250
Do not you know what tonight? Nothing special?

24:49.399 --> 24:53.599
Are you dressed? I want you dressed for the compound when I come. I'm coming.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.096
More bread? I do not need.

25:00.297 --> 25:02.497
Thank you.

25:02.549 --> 25:05.798
Did you intentionally blew? Say you are not. Jerry, I did not know!

25:05.950 --> 25:09.199
It is no longer an excuse! It's not an excuse, but a fact.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.700
This is unacceptable, why bother at all?

25:12.849 --> 25:16.701
Because you're my best friend since I was six.

25:16.902 --> 25:20.402
That's it. I'm glad you do not have to write every morning.

25:50.701 --> 25:55.201
Do not call me anymore! Do not send me messages, e-mails or any signals!

25:55.250 --> 25:59.302
I do not want to talk with a man who will only disappoint me!

25:59.403 --> 26:00.603
Goodbye!

26:00.604 --> 26:03.604
What if I'm better off?

26:03.745 --> 26:07.105
Maybe my brain is just protecting. Or maybe you're just a coward.

26:07.350 --> 26:10.906
Come in, look for it, eat something, listen to it ...

26:11.107 --> 26:13.907
Maybe the kiss. Jerry!

26:14.308 --> 26:17.308
If something goes wrong, you will not be anyway to remember in the morning.

26:17.359 --> 26:20.009
A well told.

26:22.910 --> 26:26.406
Flowers? Yes! What do you have?

26:27.107 --> 26:30.107
Yes, $ 10. Thank you.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.104
That's it? -Address the envelope.

27:00.245 --> 27:02.845
Are you sure about this? -You look as if you regret,

27:02.946 --> 27:06.046
Say you're sorry, give her a rose and begged for a second chance.

27:06.047 --> 27:08.647
The fourth floor, apartment 417

27:08.798 --> 27:12.648
Why do you care about this? -Let at least one of us has a love life.

27:13.149 --> 27:16.049
What happened to Brenda? -Get out!

27:21.050 --> 27:23.746
I open it </ i>

27:24.847 --> 27:27.847
You have forgotten your keys?

27:30.708 --> 27:34.244
I just got back. How was it ...

27:34.345 --> 27:37.145
Hi!

27:37.346 --> 27:41.046
This is for you! Sorry!

27:41.947 --> 27:45.447
Probably they need water. I'll put them in water.

27:45.648 --> 27:48.848
Here's the link. I'll ask and receive. </ i>

27:48.949 --> 27:51.949
Otherwise, I'm more organized. I'm really sorry.

27:52.100 --> 27:55.550
I feel terrible, Molly. Okay, what is this?

27:56.451 --> 28:00.251
What? -This. Flowers. I'm Molly.

28:01.752 --> 28:04.648
I know! I know.

28:04.899 --> 28:08.249
I know. Just practicing.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.750
For what? -For Molly.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.751
I'm here.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.748
This is for you! Roses, sunflowers not.

28:28.949 --> 28:31.549
Although they are beautiful.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.550
I did not ... You probably think ...

28:34.751 --> 28:38.351
I do not really know what you mean, just ...

28:38.552 --> 28:45.153
I want to accept these flowers as a sign of sincere repentance.

28:45.454 --> 28:48.354
Or, as a sign of gratitude.

29:01.300 --> 29:06.255
I'm really sorry, Molly, especially because I think you're so ...

29:06.956 --> 29:09.956
Brilliant.

29:17.257 --> 29:20.553
Wow! He just needs to keep.

29:28.354 --> 29:30.850
Molly ...

29:31.751 --> 29:34.851
Molly, do not you dare!

29:35.752 --> 29:38.452
Try it now.

29:41.253 --> 29:44.049
How'd you do that?

29:44.250 --> 29:47.050
I'm good at mechanical things.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.551
It would really be good.

29:52.652 --> 29:56.748
I wanted to thank you for making me stop.

29:56.949 --> 29:59.749
For a long time I did not even skim out.

30:00.050 --> 30:03.350
With my job and everything else ...

30:03.500 --> 30:06.151
Of course, I'm busy.

30:06.310 --> 30:09.710
Trade you doing well? -Shop?

30:09.911 --> 30:13.111
Your jewelry store where doing.

30:13.412 --> 30:17.112
Where are we ... -No.

30:17.313 --> 30:20.913
I mean, I work there, but not my jewelery.

30:21.014 --> 30:24.214
The owner was a neighbor of my parents, before they died.

30:24.265 --> 30:27.215
I've known them since childhood.

30:30.916 --> 30:34.712
You want to go somewhere else? Sure.

30:34.913 --> 30:40.813
Yes, I am studying at the same time, the waiter, can not wait something better.

30:41.114 --> 30:44.214
I moved here three years ago from the northeast.

30:44.215 --> 30:47.615
Thank you. -These are very tasty. Is not it?

30:48.516 --> 30:51.616
Why did you move here?

30:51.817 --> 30:55.317
To go fascinated. To be what I want.

30:55.718 --> 30:59.318
And what would you be? Really?

30:59.719 --> 31:06.920
I imagine a girl who is constantly worried that I would turn on her car,

31:07.900 --> 31:11.321
which does not have hardly make ends meet,

31:11.500 --> 31:14.922
which does not have to live in an apartment tuðem, which can achieve something.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.896
I want to be.

31:17.797 --> 31:19.823
Is jewelry what you really want to know?

31:19.858 --> 31:22.625
In fact, cosmology. -Hair?

31:23.726 --> 31:26.626
No, although it's close.

31:26.927 --> 31:31.127
Stars. Universe. I Cosmos </ i> - cosmology.

31:31.428 --> 31:34.228
Actually, come with me.

31:34.629 --> 31:37.829
A little to the left.

31:38.030 --> 31:42.930
See how the harmonized? You mean like a horoscope?

31:43.001 --> 31:46.231
Wrenched open a little. Sometimes squint you can see the stars ...

31:46.532 --> 31:50.332
Do you see now? That's right there. See?

31:50.533 --> 31:53.733
It is ... Teapot!

31:54.034 --> 31:57.434
No, it's shopping carts. I can see, there are wheels

31:57.935 --> 32:01.835
and that part there, it's pram! Am I right?

32:02.236 --> 32:08.467
No, but nice try. Expertly run, it's Orion.

32:08.568 --> 32:13.568
Right ascension to 5 pm, the deviation at 5 degrees ...

32:13.869 --> 32:16.869
It's very scientific.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.170
Where did you get that idea?

32:20.371 --> 32:24.171
Or may be pram! Looks just like them!

32:24.372 --> 32:27.472
And not just ... Making that up.

32:27.973 --> 32:31.873
If you're curious about the universe, how is it that you do in a jewelry store?

32:32.574 --> 32:35.074
Good question!

32:35.275 --> 32:39.075
I worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.

32:39.276 --> 32:43.076
Before that, the OUR, I graduated at Caltech.

32:43.277 --> 32:47.077
So why do not you do it?

32:47.278 --> 32:50.278
I ...

32:52.279 --> 32:54.979
Science is all around us, right?

32:55.180 --> 32:57.680
For example, diamonds. When you look at them,

32:57.681 --> 32:59.931
seems to have its own galaxy.

32:59.932 --> 33:04.982
The way the light penetrates from them and reflects the ...

33:05.183 --> 33:08.383
It can be wonderful. Sounds that stupid? I have such a feeling.

33:08.384 --> 33:10.984
Not when you're talking about.

33:10.985 --> 33:13.185
Look! See?

33:13.386 --> 33:16.486
A shooting star! Yes! Right.

33:16.487 --> 33:20.387
Technically, it was a meteor. But yes, it was a shooting star. Unbelievable.

33:20.388 --> 33:23.388
How a bunch of stardust looks so

33:23.389 --> 33:26.489
beautifully while burning the Earth's atmosphere.

33:26.990 --> 33:29.190
Yes.

33:30.291 --> 33:34.291
I gotta get back. Tomorrow I have a lot of obligations.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.792
I. ..

33:37.943 --> 33:41.593
On Sunday early raise.

33:43.194 --> 33:47.194
Yes, I'm free on Sunday afternoon.

33:48.595 --> 33:51.795
Will you give me a call on a date or not?

33:52.296 --> 33:56.496
You mean the real date? -Yes. You show up on time,

33:56.697 --> 33:59.797
do something normal, eating, talking ...

34:01.098 --> 34:03.098
Can.

34:03.150 --> 34:06.699
Then invite me on a date?

34:08.400 --> 34:11.000
Sunday.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.400
And this time I can remember, Molly. I promise.

34:14.650 --> 34:16.902
All right.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.299
Molly Brandford.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.300
Tonight you have a date with Molly Brandford.

34:27.801 --> 34:30.701
It was great.

34:32.302 --> 34:35.197
Try to find a way to keep it.

34:44.399 --> 34:47.199
I Molly Brandford. </ i>

34:47.400 --> 34:50.600
Tonight I've had a date with Molly Brandford. </ i>

34:51.701 --> 34:56.001
I was great. Try to find a way to keep it. </ I>

35:06.000 --> 35:09.500
Do I pay you to write? The break-I.

35:10.501 --> 35:12.299
I Cvjeæarnica Molly petals </ i>

35:12.300 --> 35:14.097
It's my job at the university.

35:14.298 --> 35:18.098
My plan. I Molly's lovely petals. </ i>

35:18.299 --> 35:22.199
Good. One day I'll work for you, but right now you're doing for me.

35:22.350 --> 35:26.200
Break's over. Serve customers to third in the table.

35:30.701 --> 35:33.997
I Do, I study at the same time and wait tables, </ i>

35:34.098 --> 35:37.598
I can not wait a better opportunity. I moved before ... </ i> Who is it?

35:40.309 --> 35:42.995
Girl.

35:43.050 --> 35:45.996
A friend ...

35:47.097 --> 35:51.997
With that tomorrow I have a date because we obviously went on a date last night

35:52.150 --> 35:55.398
and it was very nice.

35:56.399 --> 35:58.399
I. ..

35:58.900 --> 36:03.100
I can not explain it, but I think I really like it.

36:05.901 --> 36:09.807
Dressed because we have scheduled an appointment with a doctor.

36:11.608 --> 36:16.008
You understand that your aneurysm destroyed hippocampus?

36:16.209 --> 36:21.409
Yes. My old memories before aneurysms are normal.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.910
Sorry, you probably already ask for the hundredth time,

36:24.090 --> 36:26.190
but what about my new memories?

36:26.191 --> 36:31.012
Otherwise healthy brain using sleep assimilate short-term memory.

36:31.213 --> 36:34.713
When you around. Sleep you lose short-term memory.

36:34.854 --> 36:38.614
With so complicated neurons, it is difficult to say

36:38.790 --> 36:41.815
where information is stored.

36:42.016 --> 36:43.516
Headaches?

36:43.517 --> 36:49.217
I noted two. Lucy we developed a good system.

36:49.418 --> 36:52.218
Excellent. I'm glad you that the system works.

36:52.400 --> 36:56.419
To negotiate a new term? I can not live like this.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.016
I want my brain back. I need it.

37:01.167 --> 37:04.817
It is our goal and Gus. We are testing a promising treatment

37:05.018 --> 37:07.918
and perhaps for a year ... I do not have a year!

37:09.719 --> 37:13.419
Lucy has created this brilliant system and I am very grateful for that.

37:13.490 --> 37:18.320
All of these procedures, which helped me to make my life work, but ...

37:18.371 --> 37:23.121
I have no brief pamæenja not advance, and how could I?

37:23.192 --> 37:25.522
Every time I try to do something new,

37:25.523 --> 37:29.323
can not be given to it. I need this, I need new stuff.

37:29.524 --> 37:32.524
I need to bring me closer to people

37:32.725 --> 37:35.925
and not to forget them every damn day!

37:38.436 --> 37:41.722
Please ...

37:41.923 --> 37:45.423
If using my brain again to work.

37:47.624 --> 37:50.624
Gus, he can not.

37:51.025 --> 37:54.525
Yet. We will not give up.

37:54.726 --> 37:57.322
Everything is possible.

37:57.523 --> 38:00.723
Healed me!

38:00.924 --> 38:03.424
Please!

38:09.725 --> 38:13.121
Soon I will see you again. Are you sure you're okay?

38:13.271 --> 38:17.122
Why would not I be? -Gus?

38:19.923 --> 38:23.519
As for the new girls, if you're serious about it,

38:23.720 --> 38:27.170
you have to tell her the truth. Otherwise it's not fair.

38:29.971 --> 38:32.967
I love you. -Good.

38:33.168 --> 38:36.419
You're gonna tell her? I hardly know her! As the name anyway? Molly?

38:36.569 --> 38:38.419
Lucy is right. I decided.

38:38.420 --> 38:42.120
To tell her that she can not remember the name of the day?

38:42.121 --> 38:43.730
It's true, is not it?

38:43.771 --> 38:46.971
And when her plan to admit? We put a little bit?

38:47.122 --> 38:49.572
I'm gonna puke!

38:51.273 --> 38:54.769
If you plan to tell her and hold her,

38:54.920 --> 38:58.270
First is you have to win. Take the slip.

38:58.420 --> 38:59.845
Skating?

38:59.846 --> 39:03.371
Yes, skating. I took one girl and she was thrilled.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.072
You cheated Brenda?

39:06.193 --> 39:10.073
Brenda has another guy. We're separated!

39:10.274 --> 39:14.474
More than a year ago. More accurately, 14 months and 22 days, but who's counting?

39:15.335 --> 39:17.175
I'm tired of the constant repetition.

39:17.350 --> 39:20.606
But Brenda was great! I know!

39:21.407 --> 39:25.207
Signing the papers for the divorce was my biggest mistake in my life!

39:25.308 --> 39:29.308
Why do you think treime? Give me that your recorder.

39:30.309 --> 39:33.309
I know the perfect place where you'll take her.

39:40.700 --> 39:45.406
The rink I Moonlight Dome </ i> How did you think of this?

39:46.307 --> 39:49.807
A friend had recommended it.

39:50.708 --> 39:56.965
I'm not dressed appropriately, and I really can not ... Watch out!

39:57.666 --> 40:01.966
He was amused. And we can so.

40:02.967 --> 40:06.067
All right. Come on!

40:09.100 --> 40:13.054
Maybe we should try something else.

40:13.355 --> 40:17.055
No, you're doing great. -Through!

40:18.456 --> 40:21.706
Maybe we could get a bite.

40:21.807 --> 40:23.807
It may, of course.

40:25.308 --> 40:30.204
Ladies and gentlemen, the last of the evening is only for couples.

40:30.505 --> 40:34.105
Thus, only couples. Get away from the rink!

40:36.406 --> 40:41.406
OK, a bit of nostalgia for you golupèiæe. Enjoy!

40:51.200 --> 40:54.400
What do you think?

41:06.000 --> 41:09.297
Yes, you're doing good. -Approx.

41:10.598 --> 41:13.498
Forget it, I'm just bad at this.

41:13.699 --> 41:16.999
Molly, nobody cares. Look around you.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.500
This is buffoonery.

41:19.650 --> 41:23.201
Come closer. I promise you that I will not bite. Now the left.

41:23.852 --> 41:27.502
Right, left, right. That's it.

41:27.903 --> 41:31.103
Look, you catch the rhythm.

41:31.244 --> 41:34.204
The upcoming turn. -I got you.

41:36.605 --> 41:39.755
How long kližeš?

41:39.956 --> 41:42.756
I do not know. I always have.

41:42.957 --> 41:46.557
I always? -Wait, painting.

41:51.458 --> 41:54.654
See this turn! You did not turn around.

41:54.855 --> 41:57.455
It was not bad!

42:12.056 --> 42:14.752
Come on!

42:24.800 --> 42:28.049
Excellent're doing. I'm fine.

42:32.250 --> 42:35.346
Today was beautiful.

42:35.647 --> 42:40.647
What would you do if you could choose?

42:41.548 --> 42:44.648
I opened cvjeæarnicu.

42:44.949 --> 42:47.649
You should not be.

42:48.150 --> 42:51.950
Why would I laugh? -People are sometimes not that.

42:52.151 --> 42:55.451
I suppose that sounds ridiculous. Irrelevant.

42:55.752 --> 42:59.852
I do not sounds. Why is not already opened?

43:00.353 --> 43:03.553
I'm waiting on some money.

43:03.854 --> 43:07.154
My Aunt Ruth had no grandchildren

43:07.355 --> 43:11.355
so the property has left me and my daughter.

43:11.556 --> 43:18.657
They should divide the money but my cousin is stalling. -Awful.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.349
Waiting to solve it,

43:21.350 --> 43:25.259
I odugovlaèila is a new beginning in my life.

43:25.460 --> 43:29.060
I'm stuck, and I'm tired of waiting for something to happen.

43:29.861 --> 43:33.661
I do not want to be afraid. Do you understand me?

43:33.792 --> 43:36.662
Yes.

43:54.763 --> 43:57.659
What is it? I tell Molly ... </ i>

43:57.790 --> 44:01.760
Nothing. Nonsense.

44:01.961 --> 44:06.461
But this is what I have done for you in the diner.

44:07.362 --> 44:10.762
The rear part I'm not the best made, but ... Elephant!

44:10.963 --> 44:14.263
It's very nice, thank you. I've seen it izraðuješ.

44:14.464 --> 44:18.264
Another hidden talent. What I do not know about you?

44:20.065 --> 44:23.065
I live here.

44:23.766 --> 44:27.966
What is your apartment? Balcony with a telescope.

44:28.267 --> 44:32.767
Terror. I've never looked through a telescope.

44:33.968 --> 44:37.264
It should.

44:37.865 --> 44:41.265
I mean, one should try.

44:42.966 --> 44:45.562
Yes.

44:48.100 --> 44:52.659
I have to go, but I'll see it. -Good.

45:08.960 --> 45:12.756
Wanna talk about it? No!

45:15.057 --> 45:18.353
I want to. You were right.

45:18.554 --> 45:21.054
I'm furious at myself. Oh impossible.

45:21.295 --> 45:24.255
You really like it? Very.

45:24.396 --> 45:28.056
I literally threw herself at him. And what he did?

45:29.657 --> 45:32.257
Maybe she married.

45:32.458 --> 45:36.458
Do not do that tonight. I can not stand your cynicism.

45:36.659 --> 45:40.359
Perhaps it is better to avoid, let the other pulls him.

45:42.700 --> 45:46.800
42 years and no objection. Have you ever complained? I did not!

45:47.001 --> 45:49.601
I, vièeš! We need to do this.

45:49.802 --> 45:52.802
Blue diamonds do not just disappear!

45:53.703 --> 45:57.103
No, Addie Mae's, when they ...

45:57.304 --> 46:00.104
Great! Thank you, bye.

46:00.251 --> 46:03.105
Hey, is everything okay?

46:03.247 --> 46:06.106
Rehn insurance companies have is here, remember?

46:06.247 --> 46:10.007
Glad to see you again, Gus. -Hi. What is going on?

46:10.143 --> 46:13.608
Mr. Zed has a few questions about the blue diamond.

46:13.750 --> 46:16.609
Where the blue diamond?

46:20.310 --> 46:22.916
Iznenaðujeæe is.

46:23.060 --> 46:27.117
I was not sure he ... I do not know how I should feel.

46:27.318 --> 46:30.118
It's not just one mountain, the mountain already.

46:30.259 --> 46:34.219
I do not understand. What is there to understand?

46:35.060 --> 46:39.721
A man sends you flowers because you want to know that he likes you.

46:42.430 --> 46:44.530
I hope you like tulips. Gus </ i>

46:44.931 --> 46:47.631
This is it? Molly?

46:47.832 --> 46:50.632
It's very beautiful.

46:51.533 --> 46:54.433
Is it serious? I do not know.

46:54.584 --> 46:57.734
That's why I called you to come. Listen to this.

46:57.885 --> 47:00.735
I ... can not wait to start my life. </ i>

47:01.036 --> 47:04.236
I'm stuck, and I do not want to wait for something to happen. </ i>

47:04.237 --> 47:06.587
I do not want to be afraid of. </ i>

47:07.888 --> 47:10.684
I hate that I have to record our conversations but

47:10.800 --> 47:14.085
it will be to remember what we have done and talked,

47:14.126 --> 47:17.786
and I want to remember it. You guys should be to remember such things.

47:17.787 --> 47:23.288
Her favorite flowers, dresses on the first date, ordinary things.

47:23.689 --> 47:27.189
But it's not fair to go out with her.

47:27.390 --> 47:31.190
It is fair to decide if alone. Did you tell her?

47:31.591 --> 47:34.691
I wanted to. I intend to.

47:35.592 --> 47:39.692
I think she really likes you.

47:39.993 --> 47:43.193
What if I tell her and she did not mind at all?

47:43.324 --> 47:46.794
Or if you tell her, and it's all over? -Here's your chance to find out.

47:46.850 --> 47:49.895
That's it, is not it? Molly?

47:53.700 --> 47:57.692
No, no! I'm not on the schedule. -Now it is.

47:57.893 --> 48:00.493
I'm not on the schedule! -Good luck!

48:00.650 --> 48:03.154
I'm not in the notes! What should I do?

48:03.455 --> 48:06.455
Oh, God!

48:19.406 --> 48:22.352
Hi! Hi!

48:24.553 --> 48:27.549
I'm coming! I'm coming!

48:27.750 --> 48:30.650
Just that little poèistim.

48:30.801 --> 48:34.151
Molly, just a moment. -Gus?

48:34.452 --> 48:36.952
Here I am.

48:37.153 --> 48:39.453
Almost.

48:40.800 --> 48:44.750
Bye. -Hi. Sorry, I should have called ahead.

48:44.800 --> 48:48.752
No, I've arrived at the right time. Really? You did not?

48:49.553 --> 48:53.253
Flowers is wonderful, I just wanted to thank you.

48:53.954 --> 48:57.654
Also I have to ask you something. Sure, Come.

48:57.855 --> 49:01.455
Would you like something to drink, a snack?

49:01.756 --> 49:05.256
Or both? Oh whatever. Water?

49:05.357 --> 49:07.757
Yes, the water arrives.

49:15.900 --> 49:19.054
It's very scientific.

49:19.555 --> 49:22.455
Yeah, you know already ... Milk or sugar?

49:22.756 --> 49:25.956
What do you what do I need to bring? -Water.

49:26.057 --> 49:28.057
Exactly!

49:31.000 --> 49:34.354
No way! No way?

49:34.655 --> 49:38.355
No chance of that?

49:38.856 --> 49:42.556
Yeah, no chance. It is Ur.

49:42.857 --> 49:47.257
My sister bought them because I loved Star Wars.

49:48.658 --> 49:52.954
I still love them. You carry in your purse Chewbacca?

49:53.155 --> 49:56.155
Scary! -The grapes are my best for you?

49:56.256 --> 49:59.056
From orange. Excellent-have.

50:00.257 --> 50:02.257
So ...

50:03.758 --> 50:07.054
Your water! Thank you.

50:07.200 --> 50:11.055
I like your apartment. Thank you, nice and mine.

50:11.856 --> 50:15.556
You told me you've got to ask you something? -Yes, I ...

50:16.657 --> 50:20.257
I wanted to ask you a couple of things ...

50:20.400 --> 50:23.058
What is it?

50:23.159 --> 50:26.259
This is the last important project on which I worked.

50:26.260 --> 50:29.060
Remember the robot to explore Mars?

50:29.201 --> 50:33.461
Spirit and Opportunity? -They run autiæi the remote?

50:33.862 --> 50:36.762
They're made? Come on.

50:36.900 --> 50:40.063
You created this new they were sent?

50:40.164 --> 50:43.064
I'll get the coffee.

50:43.265 --> 50:47.365
It says so much. I wish I could read it all.

50:47.510 --> 50:51.366
Take it with you. I've already read many times.

50:53.767 --> 50:57.163
Currently working on this? -For what?

50:57.312 --> 51:04.465
Forbidden lines. New evidence on quintessencelike, Gustaf Gillenwater.

51:04.766 --> 51:08.666
Gustaf? It sounds fancy, it's you? -I was once upon a time.

51:10.767 --> 51:13.963
I was looking to throw something.

51:14.664 --> 51:17.464
For thus?

51:18.465 --> 51:21.965
Some trace. It soon as.

51:23.066 --> 51:27.262
You've done all these amazing things and obviously you liked it.

51:28.063 --> 51:31.763
how could you leave it all and move to New Orleans?

51:35.064 --> 51:38.160
People change, Molly.

51:39.161 --> 51:43.661
Sometimes these things just happen in life that affect your ...

51:45.762 --> 51:48.168
I Visible comets, 19:30 </ i>

51:48.569 --> 51:52.469
Come to show you something! Where are we going?

51:52.570 --> 51:55.170
Watch your head.

51:55.671 --> 51:59.171
All right, look over there. What do you see?

51:59.372 --> 52:03.272
Is it a meteor? No, it's ... see here.

52:03.473 --> 52:05.173
This is a comet.

52:05.174 --> 52:10.874
Frozen gas, ice and dust, which extends the gravity of the Sun.

52:11.025 --> 52:14.075
However, it is interesting to ...

52:15.776 --> 52:20.176
What? -Talking about it as if you had it in you.

52:20.377 --> 52:23.777
You had it in you. Actually, they all have.

52:23.978 --> 52:26.578
It all starts.

52:26.720 --> 52:29.979
All the elements in the universe come from stars.

52:30.680 --> 52:36.881
Since it is made of. The calcium in our bones, the iron in the blood ...

52:37.082 --> 52:40.982
It all kicked off with the explosion.

52:41.283 --> 52:46.283
No star would not see anything, either me or you ...

52:46.884 --> 52:50.284
So, we are stardust.

52:50.285 --> 52:53.085
Yes. We are.

52:53.185 --> 52:56.091
About 93%.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.500
You know, sometimes it looks as if the comet lost.

53:13.001 --> 53:15.897
And then return to orbit.

53:16.110 --> 53:20.698
And when it counted, scientists realize that it is not at all lost.

53:21.099 --> 53:24.699
Were found.

53:24.800 --> 53:27.400
Stop for a moment.

53:27.551 --> 53:30.701
I wish I could freeze this moment

53:30.850 --> 53:33.550
how he would never forget.

53:33.703 --> 53:36.203
Me too.

53:38.604 --> 53:42.500
Molly, I have something ... No!

53:43.101 --> 53:46.501
What does not? -My lecture!

53:46.802 --> 53:50.502
I'm late! I'm done! My plan! Sorry, I'm stupid!

53:50.903 --> 53:53.703
I have an important presentation tonight! I gotta go!

53:59.700 --> 54:02.200
Call me!

54:05.201 --> 54:08.597
I'll call you! I will not forget!

54:08.748 --> 54:11.998
Hi! -I will not forget.

54:12.119 --> 54:16.399
Call Molly. Do not forget! Do not forget!

54:16.550 --> 54:21.100
Do not forget Molly Branford! Arrangements compound to tell her everything!

54:21.701 --> 54:24.301
At all costs!

54:30.850 --> 54:34.399
You think it's a good idea to tell her now? -We will find out.

54:34.550 --> 54:37.600
Not every woman ... Wait a minute. What do you think?

54:37.750 --> 54:41.700
I wrote all about Molly in the folder I Read it to me every morning </ i>

54:41.850 --> 54:45.401
so that I can remember. I want it! -Some things take time.

54:45.450 --> 54:48.202
You can not just tell someone something so important.

54:48.340 --> 54:51.703
They can, if she is the right girl for me. -You say you love her?

54:51.850 --> 54:54.704
I say ... I've recorded,

54:54.850 --> 54:58.405
And after each day spent with her, just as I feel.

54:58.606 --> 55:02.106
So maybe ... Yes, I love it.

55:06.707 --> 55:08.327
Do you ispovraæaju triplets,

55:08.328 --> 55:11.627
drunk girl fell while he goes to the bathroom ...

55:11.628 --> 55:13.304
That's what I call entertainment.

55:13.450 --> 55:16.805
Maybe this job is not for me ... Saèekaj little.

55:16.950 --> 55:19.956
I'll call you later.

55:20.857 --> 55:23.957
Hello? Hey Molly, Gus.

55:24.058 --> 55:27.333
Before you say anything, I'll explain

55:27.334 --> 55:30.609
why I was acting so weird.

55:30.750 --> 55:34.010
And that? It's hard to say over the phone.

55:34.160 --> 55:37.211
I thought I'd take her somewhere special.

55:37.352 --> 55:40.912
Not Molly, Jolene said. Roommate of Molly.

55:41.613 --> 55:44.813
We met when you have me confused with Molly.

55:46.414 --> 55:49.210
How many women hustling?

55:49.260 --> 55:52.760
Call again and leave a message. I do not feel like it bother this.

56:02.700 --> 56:05.907
I Hi, this is Jolene and Molly. Saèekajte signal. </ I>

56:08.846 --> 56:11.704
Molly, Gus. I need to talk to you,

56:11.865 --> 56:15.165
explain some things. Meet me at sundown

56:15.290 --> 56:18.166
zoo Otoban.

56:18.190 --> 56:21.067
I got it? I'm waiting for you there. </ I>

56:21.168 --> 56:23.468
I deleted message. </ i>

56:38.600 --> 56:42.469
Sorry, we close early. Expected storm.

56:42.870 --> 56:45.070
Yes, I do ...

56:45.210 --> 56:48.071
I was waiting for someone.

56:48.472 --> 56:50.972
Maybe she forgot.

56:51.173 --> 56:55.073
I wanted to show her elephants. ELEPHANTS and will be here tomorrow.

57:03.004 --> 57:05.970
You're lying, are not you? Tell me you're imagining!

57:06.071 --> 57:08.871
I know I should not, but it was for your own good.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.272
I will not let you destroy some clown life.

57:12.373 --> 57:15.573
This Read it and tell me whether it's a clown.

57:15.700 --> 57:18.704
Good. I do not know what his problem is.

57:18.845 --> 57:21.445
Maybe you've got a problem. What?

57:21.546 --> 57:24.746
The way you behave ... Would you prefer that I alone

57:24.900 --> 57:28.547
and unhappy than to try to find a good one.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.348
We both know that you bring a bad decision. I was protecting you.

57:31.549 --> 57:34.849
This guy is different. He's nice and polite ...

57:34.900 --> 57:38.150
And spontaneous. If you really think it's not good for me,

57:38.300 --> 57:42.051
Why did you then say the message? You could pretend it was not there.

57:42.452 --> 57:45.652
Because I've never seen something so desire.

57:47.653 --> 57:50.153
Accident.

57:50.454 --> 57:54.154
Cooperate with me, old tank.

57:57.700 --> 58:00.451
Thank you!

58:01.552 --> 58:04.648
You're mad, do not blame you. I'm not angry.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.649
She would go there, not my fault. Roommate wiped message.

58:08.800 --> 58:12.550
Then my car would not start, then rain ... I'm so sorry.

58:12.551 --> 58:16.601
It's okay. Can I get a towel?

58:16.802 --> 58:19.202
Thank you.

58:22.703 --> 58:26.303
This is so sweet. You got our picture in the mirror.

58:26.450 --> 58:29.204
I My girlfriend Molly. </ i>

58:29.605 --> 58:35.105
Really it feel? -Yes.

58:36.806 --> 58:39.802
Molly, I have a confession to make.

58:41.203 --> 58:44.599
You're married. What? -Jolene was right.

58:44.750 --> 58:47.680
Do you have a girlfriend? Tell me the truth.

58:47.820 --> 58:50.481
Please come here.

58:51.110 --> 58:54.182
I do not have a girlfriend. I have no wife. I'm not married.

58:55.183 --> 58:58.083
But I have a problem ...

58:58.220 --> 59:01.184
With memory.

59:01.785 --> 59:04.185
I can not ...

59:06.586 --> 59:10.282
That's your problem? That's your only problem?

59:10.483 --> 59:14.283
Yes, but ... Oh please!

59:14.484 --> 59:17.684
How am only things I forgot!

59:20.005 --> 59:22.981
Sit down.

59:23.082 --> 59:25.586
Bye. -Hi.

59:25.710 --> 59:28.887
Something happened to me ... And me.

59:31.208 --> 59:34.784
No, I mean before ...

59:34.985 --> 59:36.585
Before you, before us.

59:36.586 --> 59:41.786
Gus, I do not care what happened before we met.

59:51.707 --> 59:54.483
Incredibly beautiful.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.600
I do not want to lose. I want to keep it, you want to keep.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:08.101
I want to keep your eyes your lips, your scent.

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:12.002
You smell the tulips.

01:00:15.503 --> 01:00:19.409
What is it? Nothing. I'll let the music.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.906
Are you filming us?

01:00:26.047 --> 01:00:28.607
Just tonight or ...

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:32.208
Each of our meeting? I can not explain.

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:35.709
What are you going to do with it? Published on the internet?

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:39.350
No, why would I do that? I do not know. You're the one who takes us.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.151
Do you have any cameras? I can not believe I did not anticipate.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.100
You misunderstood. I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.001
I wanted to tell you, but you did not listen. Stop it!

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:52.102
My mind is not right. Every morning, I forget everything.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.403
Stop it! I should listen to Jolene! How stupid of me!

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.404
You did not! Molly, you're stupid!

01:01:02.505 --> 01:01:05.101
Oh, my God!

01:01:18.902 --> 01:01:21.598
Molly, stop!

01:02:05.599 --> 01:02:09.595
There is little uncertainty in your life. A little?

01:02:09.796 --> 01:02:12.896
Much uncertainty. Everyone has questions.

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:16.797
Believe me, we all struggle with it. -I do not know where I am when I wake up!

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:22.098
I do not know what to do that day, in which city I live in, what we do.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.749
I need a script that I knew what I was doing yesterday, whom I saw.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.900
What people know whom should I believe?

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:32.101
And it will never change.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.202
What should I do about it?

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:38.603
Try to go slowly.

01:02:38.804 --> 01:02:41.704
With what you need to know to spend the day.

01:02:45.505 --> 01:02:49.001
Is it possible to fall in love with someone every day?

01:02:51.702 --> 01:02:55.598
No, Gustaf. Would not we all like that?

01:02:57.099 --> 01:03:00.095
It's over, is not it?

01:03:38.703 --> 01:03:41.409
Good morning. -Good morning.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.040
I'm early.

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:48.211
I did not sleep well last night. -Today, no flowers?

01:03:48.352 --> 01:03:51.912
Returning to the artificial, Baptiste. You win.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:56.619
Something wrong? What is it?

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.716
You're not as usual.

01:04:00.817 --> 01:04:04.417
You're scaring me! What is going on? -Did you hear about the execution?

01:04:04.518 --> 01:04:05.918
You mean as a decoration?

01:04:06.019 --> 01:04:09.419
As a student loan, like when you take part of government wages,

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.420
before you get.

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.620
I'm sorry, Molly.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.721
This is ... I can not live without a salary!

01:04:23.022 --> 01:04:26.622
I have to work I would go to college.

01:04:27.923 --> 01:04:30.919
What should I do?

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.816
Here you go. I do not ...

01:04:40.317 --> 01:04:43.817
I can not take it. Too.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.114
Thank you, Baptiste!

01:04:51.815 --> 01:04:55.115
It's all right, Molly. It's okay.

01:04:55.416 --> 01:04:58.516
I do not understand. I scheduled.

01:05:00.017 --> 01:05:03.800
The insurance company. Wolves do not want to admit the shelf.

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:07.200
Because of me? I can not work without insurance

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.301
and they will not renew my insurance if you keep.

01:05:12.602 --> 01:05:15.202
Sam, firing me?

01:05:16.903 --> 01:05:22.199
Listen, friends of your parents have a place in a chemical cleaner's.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.600
Can you call them ... Sam, Sam ...

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.601
It's okay. See you.

01:05:31.002 --> 01:05:34.398
I do not want a trainee, I want a real lawyer

01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:36.799
which will deal with my case.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.100
I'm tired of wrangling, it's been for two years.

01:05:41.101 --> 01:05:43.000
I'm dying here.

01:05:43.201 --> 01:05:46.201
Have him call me.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.970
I Hi, this is Jolene and Molly. Saèekajte signal. </ I>

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.371
Molly, Gus. I really ... </ i>

01:05:55.572 --> 01:05:59.572
Do not call me, Gus. Forget you ever met me.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.669
I My girlfriend Molly </ i>

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.366
I do not care that score?

01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:38.967
Not really. This is my last lecture, I give up.

01:06:39.168 --> 01:06:43.268
I'm sorry to hear that. I have no choice, so ...

01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:47.269
Check your work.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.766
Frankly, I was skeptical about you, but that you did a great.

01:06:55.267 --> 01:06:59.167
Plan with cvjeæarnicom could succeed.

01:07:00.168 --> 01:07:03.168
Thank you, Professor. Lawrence.

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:06.169
You'll keep that in mind.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.266
Who is it? Gus, is that you?

01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:38.673
What is it, Gus?

01:07:40.004 --> 01:07:44.370
Your when it flooded my living room, my system, all ...

01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:47.071
I must have fallen asleep on the couch ...

01:07:47.472 --> 01:07:51.372
I am very sorry. I'll take care of everything, as far as cost.

01:07:51.573 --> 01:07:55.073
What is necessary, Gus? Everything is destroyed.

01:07:59.474 --> 01:08:02.180
Sorry!

01:08:08.101 --> 01:08:12.077
Molly Branford from 417 Sign-in here.

01:08:19.008 --> 01:08:21.374
Thank you.

01:08:25.575 --> 01:08:27.970
It has arrived.

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:32.372
You did it! $ 234,000!

01:08:32.473 --> 01:08:35.773
Enough to start a new life.

01:08:35.774 --> 01:08:39.374
You'll go back to college? -No. I want to repay the loans,

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:44.626
find their own apartment, a car that works and rent space for cvjeæarnicu.

01:08:45.327 --> 01:08:49.050
No longer the delayed. No more excuses.

01:08:56.148 --> 01:09:00.548
Hello? -Girl! Profit'll cardiac.

01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:03.249
I'm so sorry. You're Molly.

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:07.550
What happened? -Long story.

01:09:07.751 --> 01:09:11.850
I'm sorry, who are you? Lucy, Gus's sister.

01:09:12.852 --> 01:09:16.352
I came here just to put something back.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:21.053
I wanted to tell him that I'm leaving, I'm moving out.

01:09:21.354 --> 01:09:24.354
Can you tell him goodbye for me ...

01:09:24.555 --> 01:09:27.555
Actually, do not. He's in the hospital.

01:09:27.856 --> 01:09:31.055
Observation. He'll be fine.

01:09:32.357 --> 01:09:35.256
Would you like to sit?

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:40.354
I think I was trying to say.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:43.555
Every day he had to re-learn who I am?

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:48.555
It happened on the 9th March

01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:56.358
His brain has suffered prsnuæe anterior communicating artery in the hippocampus.

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:59.309
In other words, his brain is overheated.

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:02.159
He lost everything, right?

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.656
News Week, The New York Times, London Times,

01:10:08.857 --> 01:10:13.257
The Washington Post, World Conference of scientists ...

01:10:13.658 --> 01:10:17.654
He worked on quintessencelike.

01:10:18.555 --> 01:10:23.755
Still works. He was supposed to be the next Einstein.

01:10:23.856 --> 01:10:26.656
I wish you knew him then.

01:10:26.757 --> 01:10:30.057
When did this happen? In March 2009th year?

01:10:32.658 --> 01:10:35.754
This is the last thing that remembers?

01:10:35.955 --> 01:10:41.656
Old memories of him remain forever losing sleep but new memories.

01:10:41.857 --> 01:10:45.057
At first he tried to stay awake.

01:10:45.258 --> 01:10:47.258
So when he wakes up ...

01:10:48.259 --> 01:10:52.959
It must again learn about everything new in your life. Like you.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.556
I found this morning in the trash.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:10.553
We're out of fine desserts, but I have found you some pudding.

01:11:10.754 --> 01:11:13.554
Thank you.

01:11:13.855 --> 01:11:16.555
This is for you.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.356
Thank you.

01:11:20.007 --> 01:11:22.007
I press play </ i>

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.904
I Hi Gus, Molly here. </ i>

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.905
I do not remember me, but I'm your girl. </ i>

01:11:33.006 --> 01:11:36.206
Or at least I was. We had a misunderstanding. </ I>

01:11:36.347 --> 01:11:39.207
I I've had. But it's over. </ I>

01:11:39.408 --> 01:11:42.408
I think you know better now and I hope we can </ i>

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:45.909
I start again because I fell in love with you. </ i>

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:49.310
I think that you and you feel the same. </ i>

01:11:49.311 --> 01:11:52.811
That's me on the recorder.

01:11:56.002 --> 01:12:00.608
Hi, Molly recorder.

01:12:01.509 --> 01:12:04.509
Please, sit down.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.506
I'm sorry, I do not remember you.

01:12:17.707 --> 01:12:20.803
In fact, somehow and remember.

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:36.100
I made it about you? -Yes.

01:12:36.901 --> 01:12:40.281
To be able to keep things

01:12:40.382 --> 01:12:43.782
although it had every day poèinjati again

01:12:43.983 --> 01:12:47.483
anyway we can develop our story in. .. -To build something.

01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:50.680
Yes.

01:12:52.181 --> 01:12:57.781
I spent a long time waiting for something to happen.

01:13:00.102 --> 01:13:03.378
I may have even blamed some people for their problems,

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:06.479
forgetting that I was alone responsible for their decisions.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.780
But it ended.

01:13:10.381 --> 01:13:13.781
I'm ready to take control of your life in. ..

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.782
I hope I will do that for you.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.499
Shvaæaš to ...

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.900
All you'll ever have a day

01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:34.197
and many old juèerašnjih days.

01:13:34.798 --> 01:13:38.198
No, you got me.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.995
Can you ...

01:13:46.096 --> 01:13:50.296
You can get a little closer? Why? I wrote good?

01:14:02.107 --> 01:14:05.393
How could I forget?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.190
Hi, Molly.

01:14:14.791 --> 01:14:16.991
Bye.

01:14:22.092 --> 01:14:25.588
As I said, it is a special occasion.

01:14:26.589 --> 01:14:29.989
Yes, you started talking. What's going on?

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:33.590
I discovered an exciting opportunity.

01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:36.391
And that is?

01:14:36.492 --> 01:14:39.092
There is a new laser surgery.

01:14:39.293 --> 01:14:42.093
Let me show you.

01:14:42.694 --> 01:14:47.894
This is a photo of the brain, much like what is yours.

01:14:49.895 --> 01:14:53.191
This is a photo of the same brain, but patient.

01:14:57.092 --> 01:15:00.488
They have not perfected the process, but are close.

01:15:00.689 --> 01:15:03.589
Anticipate great success.

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:07.490
Gus, this might help.

01:15:07.791 --> 01:15:11.491
I do not know ... Are you sure? You're the perfect candidate.

01:15:11.692 --> 01:15:15.692
Young, healthy, we just need to fill out paperwork.

01:15:15.993 --> 01:15:19.289
I can not pay. -No.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:23.290
I want nothing more than that, but I can not let you pay.

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:27.991
Before odluèiš, I'd take you to a place.

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.698
Where? -Sunday.

01:15:31.899 --> 01:15:35.329
I want to take you somewhere where we can talk some more about it.

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.830
We'll just leave. Just the two of us.

01:15:40.131 --> 01:15:44.031
Gus, remember Sunday.

01:15:46.732 --> 01:15:49.828
Okay? -I remember.

01:16:00.274 --> 01:16:05.674
Remember to ask for the surgery and remember to ask ...

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.971
Molly? Hi, stranèe.

01:16:14.072 --> 01:16:16.672
Yes, Molly.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.769
So, where are you taking me?

01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:30.170
Sorry, I'm taking you somewhere?

01:16:30.871 --> 01:16:32.871
Here you go.

01:16:32.972 --> 01:16:36.872
Airline tickets to Los Angeles.

01:16:37.373 --> 01:16:41.573
I want to see where you come from. I want to know what proportion taken remember.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.600
So that's it? Here you doing?

01:16:51.801 --> 01:16:54.601
Yes, in that big, with the biggest telescopes.

01:16:56.602 --> 01:17:02.002
I think you can not go in there. I thought I might be able to, but I can not.

01:17:02.037 --> 01:17:03.903
Why?

01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:06.904
Please.

01:17:07.105 --> 01:17:10.905
I can not. I'm so sorry. Can we get back to the hotel?

01:17:11.506 --> 01:17:14.456
I thought you'd want to see this place again.

01:17:14.457 --> 01:17:16.006
You do not have to watch it.

01:17:16.407 --> 01:17:20.007
I see it every morning when wake-up call, every night before bedtime.

01:17:20.108 --> 01:17:23.308
I can not stop watching.

01:17:23.509 --> 01:17:28.610
It represents everything I ever wanted, all whereof I had to give up,

01:17:28.611 --> 01:17:31.010
all I have taken and now I'm alone!

01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:34.111
You are no longer alone.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.400
I was there when it happened.

01:17:41.701 --> 01:17:44.901
That's the last thing I remember, and whereof I always to remember.

01:17:44.902 --> 01:17:46.601
Gus, I'm sorry. I did not know.

01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:51.198
But I should know. If we try together,

01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:54.499
I must be the person to whom you'll be able to tell you.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.500
Please, just a little show.

01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:02.601
Do not ask me, please.

01:18:02.802 --> 01:18:05.802
Then I see myself.

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:30.899
This is incredible!

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.196
This is your office.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.147
That was my life.

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:43.848
Everything I learned about the universe through the big glass.

01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:45.498
Through you watched?

01:18:46.899 --> 01:18:49.795
Who's there? We're all here.

01:18:49.996 --> 01:18:52.496
Bilmos, Lukrey ...

01:18:52.697 --> 01:18:56.197
Welcome back, Dr. Gillenwater. -Welcome home, Gus.

01:18:57.198 --> 01:18:59.573
We're pretty busy lately.

01:18:59.574 --> 01:19:02.248
Ruth was worried whether I want to go back home at all.

01:19:02.949 --> 01:19:06.349
Still not over and there are still a lot of work,

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:10.350
but I think it will be interesting to you. Krida, show the chart.

01:19:10.851 --> 01:19:14.351
Here it comes. -Prepare.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.648
What are you doing? -Wait ...

01:19:22.849 --> 01:19:25.649
Is this verified? For now.

01:19:25.650 --> 01:19:28.850
If it still continues, will definitely change things.

01:19:28.951 --> 01:19:31.651
Gus, this is your report.

01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:35.352
Fast facts?

01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:38.553
Quintessence? Molly gave them to us.

01:19:38.654 --> 01:19:40.804
When she called to make an appointment.

01:19:40.805 --> 01:19:44.955
I sent your note, I thought you were finished, how do I know.

01:19:44.956 --> 01:19:46.755
Putting it mildly.

01:19:46.856 --> 01:19:49.256
If these data are correct, we have just found

01:19:49.257 --> 01:19:51.656
way for the monitoring of dark energy in the universe.

01:19:51.857 --> 01:19:55.057
And if we can ... Then we will know the fate of the universe.

01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:59.058
We call I Gillenwaterov effect. </ I> We hope you do not mind.

01:19:59.259 --> 01:20:03.959
So will the whole world be called. This can not be forgotten.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.506
Thank you, guys. Thank you all.

01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:12.307
Honey, thank you.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:22.105
It used were not so long ago, giants like Hubble, even Einstein

01:20:22.306 --> 01:20:25.106
stood exactly there where you're standing.

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.879
I have used this same telescope to

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:32.508
changed our view of the universe forever.

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:38.005
Shivering! Are you cold? It's not from the cold.

01:20:38.206 --> 01:20:41.906
Oh, yeah. -Maybe a little cold.

01:20:42.907 --> 01:20:45.407
Here you go.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:50.008
Thank you. In what I see now?

01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:53.610
United light of millions of stars.

01:20:54.711 --> 01:20:56.511
I could watch it forever.

01:20:56.512 --> 01:21:02.012
Actually, could it because the universe is not only expanding but also accelerating.

01:21:02.213 --> 01:21:06.013
There is simply no end. We know that now.

01:21:06.214 --> 01:21:10.014
Forever. Comforting, is not it? -Gillenwaterov effect.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.511
I Do not forget to ask. </ i> What? -Gus!

01:21:15.712 --> 01:21:17.462
Thank God you're still here.

01:21:18.163 --> 01:21:21.212
I wanted to sell a few more questions before you go.

01:21:21.213 --> 01:21:23.013
Will take only a few minutes.

01:21:23.014 --> 01:21:25.814
Go ahead, I'll wait in the car. -Good.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.111
Bye. -Hi.

01:21:34.212 --> 01:21:37.112
Have enjoyed the visit? -Yes.

01:21:37.313 --> 01:21:41.813
Everything is wonderful! Telescope ... Unbelievable, is not it?

01:21:42.014 --> 01:21:44.814
More is not used much, but ...

01:21:45.415 --> 01:21:49.315
Good night. -I wanted to thank you.

01:21:49.516 --> 01:21:53.616
Sure. For what? -Because Gus.

01:21:54.017 --> 01:21:57.517
What did you bring him here and helped him.

01:21:57.618 --> 01:22:00.818
I'm Molly Branford. I do not know if we are already acquainted ...

01:22:01.019 --> 01:22:04.819
They told me they'll come today, I just did not want to disturb.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.720
I'm Lauren Reynolds. Did I ever mention that?

01:22:14.321 --> 01:22:18.617
We worked together and we were engaged.

01:22:27.418 --> 01:22:31.414
I assumed that someone had, but I did not know.

01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:35.415
What happened?

01:22:36.216 --> 01:22:40.216
We were in love, then an aneurysm in. ..

01:22:40.617 --> 01:22:43.817
For months I tried.

01:22:44.018 --> 01:22:48.018
His sister had decided to take, and I wanted to go but ...

01:22:48.219 --> 01:22:51.019
In the end I could not.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.720
You left him. But not for him.

01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:59.421
I wanted to have children. We could have just ...

01:22:59.722 --> 01:23:03.722
them he would not be remembered. -Yes.

01:23:07.223 --> 01:23:11.419
Do not tell him to meet you. Better that way.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.120
We're sorry. Molly, I'm glad that I met you.

01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:17.421
Me too.

01:23:29.022 --> 01:23:32.718
Are you okay? What is it? I'm fine.

01:23:36.019 --> 01:23:39.669
Do you wake up every morning expecting that you'll

01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:43.519
be here to work with your friends?

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.126
Every morning I wake up I'm not sure of anything.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.623
Molly, I want to try with that operation. Really?

01:23:59.224 --> 01:24:02.624
Gus, it's ... -Molly!

01:24:04.525 --> 01:24:13.818
If the operation fails, I want to tell me something obeæaš.

01:24:15.619 --> 01:24:18.867
I want you to obeæaš you'd forget me

01:24:18.868 --> 01:24:22.116
and delete it from my life. What? I will not!

01:24:22.317 --> 01:24:25.117
Listen to me!

01:24:25.318 --> 01:24:28.118
When I'm with you all seems fine.

01:24:31.019 --> 01:24:34.415
I wish I would have been enough.

01:24:35.616 --> 01:24:39.012
Never and I'm not going to remember in the morning.

01:24:39.913 --> 01:24:43.109
And you deserve more than that.

01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:47.710
Only on this condition I will go into surgery. Either that or nothing.

01:24:50.611 --> 01:24:53.407
Promise me, Molly.

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:58.304
Will you promise me?

01:25:03.305 --> 01:25:05.805
Thank you.

01:25:18.806 --> 01:25:22.102
Hey sis. -Let me help you.

01:25:23.003 --> 01:25:25.803
Are we supposed to find? -No.

01:25:25.904 --> 01:25:28.054
I knew that you went with her the conductor

01:25:28.055 --> 01:25:30.204
so I decided to update the computer.

01:25:30.405 --> 01:25:34.605
I'll be back tomorrow and I'll explain everything. Where were you?

01:25:35.406 --> 01:25:38.606
The Mount Wilson.

01:25:40.007 --> 01:25:43.807
Will we take this to the car? Green VW Beetle.

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:48.904
Be right back.

01:25:52.805 --> 01:25:56.001
It's not easy to him, but you gotta love it.

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:59.702
And I really love it. I have to warn you.

01:25:59.903 --> 01:26:03.303
Do not count on it that he will be better.

01:26:03.504 --> 01:26:07.504
What is the one brochure for the hospital? -Gus is interested.

01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:11.405
It is a new surgical technique. Yes, they have in LA.

01:26:11.606 --> 01:26:15.606
And it's not exactly new. Are applied to the Gus 2 years ago.

01:26:15.707 --> 01:26:20.007
She was not successful. -Gus is already operated?

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:23.708
Molly, if you really love me, you have to be aware of what you're getting into.

01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:27.409
Because it's possible that will never recover.

01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:31.210
Done!

01:26:32.011 --> 01:26:34.611
Keep yourself.

01:26:34.912 --> 01:26:37.112
See you tomorrow.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:47.409
Hey, Gus! I, Max.

01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:50.410
You owe me five bucks. -Keep your wallet in your pocket.

01:26:51.011 --> 01:26:54.411
Tell him you were kidding, Max. Just kidding.

01:26:54.512 --> 01:26:56.732

Hi, Sam. -We decided that we need to refresh the store.

01:30:25.158 --> 01:30:29.358

In one of the drawers I found this. Blue diamond.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:51.400
He fell behind the drawer. -Whoa! Super.

01:30:51.701 --> 01:30:54.601
Great.

Sometimes it seems that the comet lost

01:35:12.512 --> 01:35:15.812
and then return to orbit and scientists understand

01:35:15.913 --> 01:35:18.813
