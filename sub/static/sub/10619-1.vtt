01:10.560 --> 01:13.131
<i>My story can never be told.</i>

01:14.360 --> 01:16.681
<i>I write it over and over</i>

01:16.840 --> 01:19.127
<i>wherever we find shelter.</i>

01:20.960 --> 01:23.247
<i>I write of what I cannot speak.</i>

01:24.680 --> 01:26.250
<i>The truth.</i>

01:27.600 --> 01:29.364
<i>I write all I know of it.</i>

01:30.400 --> 01:32.721
<i>And then I throw the pages to the wind.</i>

01:35.280 --> 01:37.521
<i>Maybe the birds can read it.</i>

02:32.600 --> 02:34.250
This yours?

02:35.360 --> 02:38.091
I often find them here, these scraps.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.641
Must float down from someone's window.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.649
"She had meant to smother the baby

02:51.800 --> 02:53.450
"as soon as it was born.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.602
"But something made her look at it.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.560
"She heard the thundering heartbeat.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.769
"She smelt the baby's bloodied head.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.570
"And love confounded her."

03:05.720 --> 03:08.326
It's just a scrap, like you say.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.249
But there's a story there.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.850
You can feel it.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.649
Shall we walk a little?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.802
<i>My story starts with Clara.</i>

03:20.160 --> 03:22.128
<i>One day, it will end with her.</i>

03:23.800 --> 03:26.121
<i>Clara,</i>

03:26.280 --> 03:28.009
<i>full of secrets.</i>

03:29.800 --> 03:32.087
<i>My saviour.</i>

03:32.240 --> 03:34.561
<i>My burden.</i>

03:34.720 --> 03:36.245
<i>My muse.</i>

03:52.120 --> 03:53.221
Hey!

03:54.680 --> 03:57.968
- Fuckin' hell. Wendy.
- I'll call you back.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.690
Fuck you!

04:03.400 --> 04:05.164
You bastard! Did you see that?

04:05.320 --> 04:07.129
He fucking attacked me.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.000
- What's she done?
- Really fucked his nose.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.508
Yeah, well, he deserved it.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.966
Ernie. Get him out of here, mate.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.440
My nose! My nose.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.969
Would you care for tea?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.090
Please come in.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.966
I have been working here for 14 nights.
I want my pay!

04:41.120 --> 04:43.088
You're not on the books. What pay?

04:55.040 --> 04:57.884
Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.247
No. Sorry, mate.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.924
Sorry.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.723
No.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.001
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, babe, but they owe me.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.401
- No! You can't take till money!
- They owe me.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.291
Hello, Clara.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.765
We get a lot of bitches in here,

05:23.920 --> 05:25.285
but she took the fucking prize.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.841
Shame- she was morbidly sexy.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.285
Move!

06:13.000 --> 06:15.082
Clara!

06:24.920 --> 06:26.843
Shit! Fuck!

06:42.880 --> 06:45.087
The tedium I have experienced in this pursuit.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.864
My time you have wasted.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.971
You would sell nations
with your whoredoms.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.202
Come on. You know who I'm looking for.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.571
Where is she?

06:55.520 --> 06:56.809
Where is she?!

06:56.960 --> 06:59.406
I was him once.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.125
And that girl...

07:04.360 --> 07:06.966
Love confounded me for her.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.327
I loved her my whole life through.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.322
Your wife?

07:18.960 --> 07:21.201
She was married to my brother John.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.650
Most happily.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.810
She never knew the way I felt.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.530
Nor did he.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.528
There comes a time in life
when secrets should be told.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.085
You've got secrets, haven't you?

07:58.560 --> 08:01.564
There was a story told
when I was a boy...

08:02.600 --> 08:05.001
about the <i>neamh mairbh-</i>

08:05.160 --> 08:07.162
the revenants.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.283
Neither dead nor alive.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.606
The priests used to tell it
to frighten us.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.287
My name is Eleanor Webb.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.044
Eleanor Webb...

08:32.799 --> 08:34.529
I am ready.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.424
Are you sure?

08:41.760 --> 08:44.604
I've spent quite enough time here,

08:44.760 --> 08:46.762
believe me.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.409
I feel a great peace.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.121
As if order is about to be restored.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.569
She is an aberration.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.364
I don't know what that means, sir.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.288
Where do you think you're going?

09:53.440 --> 09:55.886
I was going to clean the wound, sir.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.122
You've been cut. It's conspicuous.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.806
All the time you've had
and you've learnt nothing.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.249
Truly, you're base.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.850
Close your eyes.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.610
- Clara?
- Get out.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.730
How could you bring someone here?

11:29.880 --> 11:31.803
- He was stronger than I thought.
- This is our home!

11:31.960 --> 11:33.689
Eleanor, we have to leave.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.730
- I'm not moving on again.
- I had to do it!

11:36.880 --> 11:38.928
- One day, you'll understand.
- What, when I'm old enough?

11:39.080 --> 11:41.811
You have no idea- no fucking idea-
of what I do for you.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.361
- You did that for me?!
- Pack!

11:44.560 --> 11:46.801
- I liked it here.
- I said pack!

12:15.640 --> 12:17.165
- Who was he?
- No-one.

13:03.320 --> 13:07.006
<i>Mother was bathing her baby one night</i>

13:08.040 --> 13:13.683
<i>Youngest of 10 and a poor little mite</i>

13:14.960 --> 13:19.124
<i>Mother was fat and the baby was thin</i>

13:20.960 --> 13:22.769
<i>It was naught but a</i>

13:22.920 --> 13:27.323
<i>Skellington wrapped up in skin</i>

13:30.360 --> 13:34.604
<i>Mother turned round
for the soap from the rack...</i>

13:36.880 --> 13:38.803
- Thank you.
- Alright, see you, girls.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.282
Shall we have a look in the greenhouse, then?

14:15.440 --> 14:17.010
Alright, then.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.204
We've been here before.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.844
Don't be silly. Come on.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.928
But don't you remember?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.964
It's gonna be good for us here,
I can feel it.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.531
You said that about the last place.

15:25.780 --> 15:28.001
What, that dump that we just left?

15:28.160 --> 15:30.083
I've forgotten it already.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.125
What's the matter?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.931
You can't throw the past away
as if it didn't happen.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.962
My concern is now, OK?

15:43.300 --> 15:44.401
Silly sod.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.646
Why don't you go
and play on the amusements, yeah?

16:02.960 --> 16:04.689
Gonna make us some money.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.729
Go on.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.406
<i>Clara is never alone.</i>

16:14.600 --> 16:17.206
<i>She finds money and company every day.</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:20.443
<i>It comes easily to her.</i>

16:20.640 --> 16:22.005
<i>Like lying.</i>

16:22.160 --> 16:25.528
- Who's that? You know her?
- No...

16:25.680 --> 16:27.648
- Have you seen her?
- No.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.723
<i>But I like solitude.</i>

16:34.040 --> 16:35.405
<i>I walk.</i>

16:35.600 --> 16:37.523
<i>And the past walks with me.</i>

16:38.920 --> 16:40.843
<i>It lives.</i>

18:35.000 --> 18:36.729
Hi.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.531
It's 50 for a blow, 100 for full whack.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.330
Did they hire you?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.729
You're busking.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.405
You can pass a hat around.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.250
I don't mind.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.121
That was great.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.289
Can you speak?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.324
I haven't got a hat.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.891
How do you remember all those notes?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.088
I remember everything.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.810
It's a burden.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.890
So...

19:53.640 --> 19:55.165
you know anything else?

19:56.960 --> 19:59.247
Try and liven them up.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.131
It's the valley of the stiffs in here.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.045
I have to go.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.888
I finish at 10:00.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.930
Come in.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.531
50. Lovely.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.009
So, are you on holiday, then?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.208
- No.
- Oh, you live round here?

20:56.360 --> 20:57.850
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.607
- You fancied a bit of company.
- She...

21:04.240 --> 21:05.810
Who?

21:08.840 --> 21:10.968
Mum.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.770
She died.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.723
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.325
There was a funeral.

21:18.520 --> 21:20.124
I couldn't.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.328
Yeah, I ran away from it.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.648
I've not been out...
I've not been out since.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.762
But your grief, that shows
how much you loved her.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.601
And love is a very good thing.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.808
I bet she'd be proud of you.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.202
A lovely son like you.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.008
No, I never made her proud.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.850
I just...

21:57.000 --> 21:58.764
I don't even answer the phone.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.165
You know?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.005
I messed up the business,
I can't pay her debts.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.128
Found 50 quid in one of her old books,

22:06.280 --> 22:07.850
and what do I spend it on?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.008
Human contact.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.688
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.729
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry, love.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.605
I'm Camilla.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.967
Noel.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.004
So, what sort of a business
did your mum have, then, Noel?

22:39.720 --> 22:42.326
It was a guesthouse. I trashed it.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.931
Was it a big place?

22:48.120 --> 22:49.690
Yeah, it's fairly big.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.730
Well...

22:52.880 --> 22:54.325
Do you...

22:54.520 --> 22:56.522
Shall we go back to your place, then?

22:58.720 --> 23:00.290
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.329
- Be nice.
- Yeah...

23:02.520 --> 23:04.284
- You could come back to mine.
- Yeah.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.765
Glad you waited for me.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.445
I didn't.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.290
How did you learn to play like that?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.084
I practised.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.969
For how long?

23:41.760 --> 23:43.285
200 years.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.689
That's how it feels anyways, doesn't it?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.289
Passed around a teacup.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.209
Raised some cash for you.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.250
It's not much.

24:01.920 --> 24:03.729
Thank you.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.883
And that piece of paper.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.045
That's my phone number.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.170
I don't have a phone.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.288
So...

24:29.440 --> 24:30.851
ni... nice...

24:31.000 --> 24:32.570
nice to meet you.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.770
Goodbye.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.084
Ella! Ella!

25:00.240 --> 25:01.766
Look what I found!

25:02.920 --> 25:05.002
We're damsels in distress.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.121
Do you know what Noel is, Ella?

25:09.280 --> 25:11.726
He's a knight in shining armour.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.302
Come to deliver us from evil, aren't you?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.249
This is my little baby sister.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.045
- Hi.
- Hello.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.645
There we go.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.164
Been looking for you everywhere.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.042
Can't find my keys.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.524
I'll just open up.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.729
Come on, then.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.803
Look, I'm trusting you, Camilla.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.049
- Don't.
- I won't.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.328
Look, I'm not saying it's tidy.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.371
It was a hotel once.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.166
Then a boarding house.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.207
My mum had the top two floors.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.125
Used to do B & Bs, you know?
Families and that.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.851
But then it was more, you know,
the welfare lot.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.571
It's a bit run-down now,
but she wouldn't let it go.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.250
Loved the views, you see.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.524
Fantastic view of the pier from up here.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.091
Lovely.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.288
This is the dining area.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.044
Well...

26:54.200 --> 26:55.770
It's nice.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.564
Yeah, it's lovely.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.848
It's a bit of a state,
like I said, but...

27:01.000 --> 27:02.402
I wasn't expecting company.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.851
Tell my sister where her room is first.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.405
Yeah.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.568
Ella...

27:18.720 --> 27:20.370
I'll show you to your room.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.331
I went round the house and...

27:38.360 --> 27:40.283
smashed things up.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.810
I didn't want to look at myself.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.922
Camilla said that...

27:52.080 --> 27:53.445
you lost your mum too.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.211
She's your legal guardian?

27:58.840 --> 28:00.365
That's brave of her.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.363
Well, I understand what she's had to do.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.445
Do you?

28:10.520 --> 28:12.045
Well, she needs money.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.046
What I'm saying is...

28:21.520 --> 28:23.045
I don't care.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.890
- You can stay.
- Thank you.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.088
<i>Only those prepared to die
will find eternal life.</i>

29:12.040 --> 29:14.361
Go on. Go on.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.768
This is the end.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.161
- Of what?
- Of time.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.643
Good boy.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.125
Who was he?

32:02.280 --> 32:04.169
It's in the past, Ella.
Let it go.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.244
- Who was he?
- He was a fucking monster.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.767
I should get a medal
for what I did to him.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.010
Will we move on today?

32:17.040 --> 32:18.610
Are you tired, my love?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.525
Well...

32:23.680 --> 32:25.205
I reckon that we should

32:25.360 --> 32:27.647
hang on here for a few days, don't you?

32:27.800 --> 32:32.328
Yeah. We can lay low, get some rest.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.682
Get some money.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.605
I could start up one of my old businesses
like in the old days.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.888
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, come on, Ella.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.883
Look at this place- it's perfect.
We'd rake it in.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.930
Why don't we find another way?

32:45.080 --> 32:46.030
It's alright, angel.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.520
I'll make sure you're not involved.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.466
I'm sorry, Noel.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.127
I was worried I dreamt you.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.970
I thought I'd wake up and you'd be gone.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.168
Why would I leave?

33:14.320 --> 33:16.846
You've got everything I need.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.690
Eleanor Webb.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.730
Look at you.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.524
Fair as a lily.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.405
I know your mother.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.288
My mother is dead.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.803
Is that what they told you?

34:35.920 --> 34:38.002
They've fed you on lies.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.650
Your mother...

34:46.800 --> 34:49.326
Your mother stole something from me.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.320
Now I'll steal something from her.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.563
My disease has no cure.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.370
And when I've finished with you,

35:03.560 --> 35:05.961
you'll be a child no longer.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.003
Look at me!

35:14.000 --> 35:16.002
Eleanor?

35:17.760 --> 35:19.285
Are you OK?

35:28.080 --> 35:31.004
Camilla's told me about
how you were in a care home.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.650
She said that...

35:36.280 --> 35:38.328
She said that bad things happened
to you there.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.602
I want you to know
that nothing bad will happen

35:42.760 --> 35:44.285
while you're living here.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.841
I promise. OK?

35:52.520 --> 35:54.409
Her name's not Camilla.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.966
- And she's not my sister.
- My name's Claire.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.690
It's Clara.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.002
- She was born Clara.
- But I prefer Claire.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.205
Claire.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.162
- Don't.
- You lie about me all the time.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.084
If you tell him, I will kill him.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.840
Don't you sometimes crave
to tell the truth?

36:16.880 --> 36:20.362
There is a code that we survive by,
Eleanor. Keep it.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.610
So, in a week, say,
how much would your mum make?

36:32.640 --> 36:34.847
Uh, high season?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.525
About a thousand.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.409
We could make that in a night.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.408
You could clear all your debts, Noely.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.366
Yeah, but... I want to save you
from that life.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.325
Well, it wouldn't have to be me.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.170
You could get some girls in.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.129
But...

36:52.280 --> 36:53.930
Well, this is my mother's house.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.088
<i>He's so fair</i>

37:00.360 --> 37:03.523
<i>None can compare</i>

37:04.560 --> 37:10.169
<i>Oh, but his blood runs ruby...</i>

37:12.400 --> 37:15.404
<i>Come, rosy day</i>

37:17.120 --> 37:21.045
<i>Come quick, I pray</i>

37:22.280 --> 37:26.285
<i>Let dreams of love</i>

37:27.320 --> 37:30.085
<i>Be over</i>

37:31.880 --> 37:35.168
<i>Once upon a time,
there was nothing here.</i>

37:37.080 --> 37:39.321
<i>There was no hotel,</i>

37:39.520 --> 37:41.045
<i>no promenade.</i>

37:42.920 --> 37:45.048
<i>Just a beach.</i>

37:45.200 --> 37:47.202
<i>Nets hanging out to dry.</i>

37:48.760 --> 37:50.842
<i>Great warships in the bay.</i>

37:52.160 --> 37:54.845
<i>And children picking cockles
for their bread.</i>

37:57.000 --> 37:59.128
<i>My mother was one of those children.</i>

38:00.160 --> 38:01.844
<i>Barefoot in the sand.</i>

38:02.000 --> 38:03.571
Can you hear me?

38:11.120 --> 38:14.090
My mother lives on human blood

38:14.240 --> 38:16.686
and has done for two centuries.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.723
<i>But once, she was a girl like you.</i>

38:24.400 --> 38:27.085
<i>She's never spoken of her family.</i>

38:27.240 --> 38:29.322
<i>They're in the store of things
she must forget.</i>

38:31.200 --> 38:32.645
<i>So her tale begins</i>

38:32.800 --> 38:35.041
<i>with two officers waiting
to be called to war.</i>

38:35.200 --> 38:37.123
Are they sweet?

38:37.280 --> 38:38.691
May I try one?

38:38.840 --> 38:40.763
<i>One was Midshipman Darvell.</i>

38:50.840 --> 38:52.285
Here.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.930
A pearl for a pearl.

38:57.080 --> 39:01.404
<i>And the other, his superior,
was Captain Ruthven.</i>

39:02.440 --> 39:04.249
May I offer you a ride?

39:05.360 --> 39:07.169
She's only a child, Ruthven.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.129
She knows how to ride, I dare say.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.010
Don't go with him.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.650
<i>The pearl stays pure forever</i>

39:23.800 --> 39:26.610
<i>while the oyster's flesh
rots around it.</i>

39:29.560 --> 39:31.562
I have a gift for you.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.603
Captain Ruthven!

39:44.840 --> 39:47.889
Here's a treasure I found on the beach.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.641
Welcome, my dear.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.165
There's nothing to be afraid of.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.970
Come on.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.885
Let me show you to the captain's
favourite room.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.883
You'll find only friends here.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.284
You gave me nothing, sir.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.010
You took.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.321
I've given you your profession.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.724
Welcome to your adult life.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.762
<i>How many stories start that way?</i>

40:18.920 --> 40:20.285
Whore.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.249
<i>Thousands upon thousands.</i>

40:23.720 --> 40:25.245
I shall return...

40:27.240 --> 40:29.561
to see what you have learnt.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.644
Come, now. Why do you cry?

40:39.360 --> 40:40.850
I have a gentleman here

40:41.000 --> 40:43.002
who will soon have you smiling again.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.806
No children in this household.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.410
You know the rule.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.843
<i>Once upon a time, I was born.</i>

41:02.040 --> 41:04.361
<i>It is still a fact
that the day you are born</i>

41:04.560 --> 41:07.086
<i>is the day you are most likely
to be murdered.</i>

41:08.720 --> 41:11.690
<i>More human souls are killed
by mothers' hands</i>

41:11.840 --> 41:13.683
<i>than by the hands of strangers.</i>

41:15.640 --> 41:17.642
<i>My mother tried to murder me.</i>

41:19.280 --> 41:21.123
<i>But love confounded her.</i>

41:31.760 --> 41:36.049
<i>Her note said,
"This is my daughter, Eleanor Webb.</i>

41:37.200 --> 41:39.931
<i>"I wish her to live a clean life.</i>

41:40.080 --> 41:42.686
<i>"I shall pay for her upkeep with gold,</i>

41:42.840 --> 41:45.684
<i>"which I will leave every month
that she lives.</i>

41:47.360 --> 41:49.806
<i>"I wish to spare her a life
like my own,</i>

41:49.960 --> 41:52.247
<i>"which has been despoiled from the start.</i>

41:54.120 --> 41:55.849
<i>"Please tell her I'm dead."</i>

42:23.280 --> 42:25.601
<i>So I led that clean life.</i>

42:27.000 --> 42:28.889
<i>I sang the orphan's song.</i>

42:30.560 --> 42:32.722
<i>I learned that virtue and modesty</i>

42:32.880 --> 42:34.530
<i>would be my path to bliss.</i>

42:36.160 --> 42:39.209
<i>North Haven Private Orphanage
was my abode.</i>

42:42.040 --> 42:44.122
<i>I wish I could have called it home.</i>

43:01.360 --> 43:03.647
- Damn!
- I'm sorry!

43:05.080 --> 43:06.445
Fuck.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.005
Oh, that's gross.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.924
There. There.

43:12.180 --> 43:13.444
Shit, I've got to get home.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.324
Well, let me get help.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.889
I've got your bicycle. Don't worry.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.207
You need stitches.

43:25.360 --> 43:27.283
Were you there to enrol?

43:27.440 --> 43:28.529
What?

43:30.560 --> 43:33.689
- Have you joined the college?
- I don't know.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.365
Leave the bike there.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.249
Oh, I hate blood.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.971
Could you get the doorbell, please?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.325
Come on.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.128
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- He fell.

43:56.280 --> 43:58.248
Oh, my God! Oh... Mark!

43:58.400 --> 44:00.448
<i>Mark! He's bleeding!</i>

44:00.640 --> 44:01.969
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

44:08.680 --> 44:11.411
- <i>Mark!
- <i>It's OK. I got him. I got him.</i></i>

44:11.600 --> 44:13.728
<i>Get the keys.</i>

44:13.880 --> 44:16.326
<i>Are you his girlfriend?</i>

44:16.520 --> 44:18.443
<i>Where are the keys?!</i>

44:23.920 --> 44:25.000
<i>Has he told you?</i>

44:27.920 --> 44:30.002
- <i>Got the keys?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

44:32.320 --> 44:34.402
<i>Keep it up, keep it up, Frank.</i>

44:37.800 --> 44:39.723
<i>Go, go! Frank!</i>

45:28.120 --> 45:29.849
You could do so much better.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.250
- Oi.
- Would you like to kiss me?

45:46.400 --> 45:48.129
What the fuck? Why?

45:48.280 --> 45:51.887
In celebration... of my wickedness.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.165
The world'll be more beautiful without you.

47:07.800 --> 47:11.043
It's alright. I gotcha. It's OK.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.770
It's OK.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.406
- I want to die.
- No, you don't.

47:16.600 --> 47:18.568
Not today.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.803
If you still want to die tomorrow,
I'll finish you off myself.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.731
Hello? Oh, hi.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.325
Is it still visiting?

48:48.840 --> 48:50.604
Thanks for bringing him home.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.884
He hasn't told me anything about you.

48:57.040 --> 48:59.361
That's boys for you, isn't it?

49:00.400 --> 49:02.164
Have you been going out for long?

49:02.320 --> 49:03.969
We just met.

49:06.840 --> 49:10.128
I'm glad. What's your name?

49:10.280 --> 49:12.248
Eleanor.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.129
Gabi.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.367
He takes anticoagulants.

49:25.560 --> 49:28.450
That's why he bled so much.
I expect you're wondering.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.881
He's been fighting leukaemia for years.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.728
It's in remission now, so...
we're hoping it's all over.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.329
So full of life.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.770
Please don't tell him I was here.

50:41.320 --> 50:43.129
Angel.

50:53.400 --> 50:54.970
Peace be with you.

50:56.680 --> 50:59.331
May light shine upon you.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.603
You came for me.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.766
Forgive me for what I must do.

51:30.640 --> 51:33.803
- Oh, hi!
- Hi!

51:36.400 --> 51:37.971
You speak?

51:40.080 --> 51:43.687
Speak English, you schoolgirl thing?

51:47.400 --> 51:50.847
She better pay like she say
or I'll say no further.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.606
Maybe we do lesbian thing.

51:53.760 --> 51:55.125
I don't mind.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.009
That's my little baby sister.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.924
She doesn't drink, she doesn't join in.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.809
You leave her be. Do you understand?

52:00.960 --> 52:03.611
Now, your gentlemen are waiting for you.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.569
Now, you be professional, OK,

52:05.720 --> 52:07.370
otherwise you're back
sucking cocks on the street.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.085
Out!

52:10.720 --> 52:12.609
I'll try and keep you out of this, OK?

52:12.760 --> 52:14.524
- In case you shock me?
- Look, we need the money.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.045
I'm not complaining.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.929
Well, then, wipe that prissy look
off your face.

52:18.080 --> 52:21.323
How can I be prissy when I've seen it all
a thousand times before?

52:21.520 --> 52:23.249
Well, what else are we supposed to do?

52:24.320 --> 52:25.731
I know I won't get your thanks

52:25.880 --> 52:27.245
or your gratitude or your respect.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.767
- You could do so much better.
- I put money on the table.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.721
- That's what mothers do.
- Mothers care about

52:31.760 --> 52:33.842
the lives their children live.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.843
What kind of life is this?

53:09.120 --> 53:11.441
<i>Humans need to tell stories.</i>

53:11.640 --> 53:16.168
It's a fundamental and uniting thing.

53:16.320 --> 53:20.689
It's through stories
that we come to understand ourselves

53:20.840 --> 53:23.047
and we come to understand the world.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.962
So close your eyes.

53:29.520 --> 53:32.410
It's our own experience
that is the starting point

53:32.600 --> 53:35.001
for all our creativity.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.728
Think about your early childhood.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.363
And when I say your name...

53:45.600 --> 53:46.965
give me a memory-

53:47.120 --> 53:51.364
a detail, a sensation, a feeling.

53:51.560 --> 53:54.245
<i>The first thing that comes
into your mind. OK?</i>

54:19.720 --> 54:22.371
- <i>Eleanor.</i>
- Mother.

54:23.640 --> 54:25.165
What about her?

54:27.320 --> 54:29.448
She would come to the skylight at night.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.890
I was afraid.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.849
Why?

54:37.200 --> 54:40.090
They told me since infancy
that she was dead.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.090
And then?

54:48.560 --> 54:49.925
<i>The face at the window</i>

54:50.080 --> 54:51.445
<i>had more substance than a ghost.</i>

54:51.640 --> 54:53.005
OK, thanks.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.844
- <i>And yet...</i>
- Frank.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.570
<i>I knew it could not live.</i>

54:56.720 --> 55:00.566
Yeah... my friend...

55:00.720 --> 55:02.768
David Atkinson.

55:04.920 --> 55:07.400
I'm the only person who can see him.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.601
I was probably too much alone, whatever,

55:12.760 --> 55:18.005
and David Atkinson used to appear

55:18.160 --> 55:19.810
in my room.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.570
And we'd play.

55:23.680 --> 55:25.808
And I guess I grew out of him.

55:25.960 --> 55:30.010
He came till I was about seven or eight.

55:31.600 --> 55:33.967
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.570
- OK...
- The really funny thing

55:36.720 --> 55:38.245
is that...

55:40.400 --> 55:42.323
years later,

55:42.520 --> 55:44.841
I found out that the family
before us in the house

55:45.000 --> 55:46.570
were called Atkinson.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.241
They lost a baby, like, a cot death.

55:52.120 --> 55:54.407
And the baby's name...

55:54.600 --> 55:56.011
was David.

55:58.120 --> 56:00.043
Good story.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.684
So, everyone up.

56:02.840 --> 56:08.085
Now, I want you to think about
who you are.

56:09.360 --> 56:14.366
And next time, I would like an essay...

56:15.600 --> 56:17.125
entitled...

56:20.200 --> 56:23.204
'I Am'.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.364
And there's only one rule.

56:29.280 --> 56:31.009
It has to be true.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.766
You don't belong here.

56:37.320 --> 56:40.005
This is my mum's home town.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.970
We came when I got ill.

56:45.800 --> 56:51.045
The health care over here is free,
and I was...

56:53.120 --> 56:54.263
something of a...

56:56.280 --> 56:59.807
a drain on our limited resources.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.325
My dad commutes.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.642
I don't think he likes it much, but...

57:11.000 --> 57:12.764
what are you gonna do?

57:21.680 --> 57:25.924
My mum said you came to see me
when I was in hospital.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.864
She...

57:32.560 --> 57:34.085
she thinks...

57:35.160 --> 57:38.607
that... that you're my girl.

58:07.320 --> 58:08.890
Would that be so bad?

58:09.920 --> 58:12.048
- Because I...
- It would be fatal.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.650
Look...

58:21.080 --> 58:23.321
I know I'm... I'm ill and all, but...

58:23.520 --> 58:25.045
No.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.730
For me.

58:39.280 --> 58:42.011
If you lived with a secret...

58:44.120 --> 58:48.728
and the secret meant
that you must always lie

58:48.880 --> 58:51.042
or be alone,

58:51.200 --> 58:52.850
and you'd always lived that way

58:53.000 --> 58:54.809
and yet you longed for change...

58:56.200 --> 58:57.804
what would you do?

59:05.360 --> 59:07.203
I'd tell the secret.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.084
Tell me.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.687
<i>My mother did three things for me.</i>

59:54.920 --> 59:57.969
<i>One, she spared my life
the day that I was born.</i>

59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.525
<i>Two, she paid for my upkeep
on her knees and on her back.</i>

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.729
<i>And three,</i>

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.724
<i>she gave me the story
I can never tell.</i>

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.450
<i>By the time I was six,</i>

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.404
<i>she was dying.</i>

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.444
<i>Girls like Clara didn't last.</i>

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.563
<i>Her lungs were rotting.</i>

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.644
<i>But she clung steadfastly
to her brutal life.</i>

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.124
Where have you been?

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.009
The captain's been waiting.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.446
<i>Captain Ruthven had returned from the wars.</i>

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.847
Make sure you punish her, sir.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.241
<i>Of all the harlots he had ever made...</i>

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.084
<i>Clara was his favourite.</i>

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.445
You'll like this one. She fights.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.450
<i>Then, one winter dawn...</i>

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.125
<i>a stranger came.</i>

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.610
Are you unwell?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.644
No, sir.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.405
I remember you.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.810
I'm much changed, sir.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.930
And what of me?

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.205
Have I changed?

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.965
I have.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.690
More than you could imagine.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.570
Open the curtains.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.881
Oh, curse you, whore.
Give me the dark!

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.684
Does the light offend you?

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.650
Darvell.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.285
My friend.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.684
But I was with you.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.929
I saw you dead.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.849
And I thank you for your service.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.285
What do you want?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.328
I have not come to take from you.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.930
I come to give.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.168
I'll return at nightfall.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.290
Like you, I prefer the dark.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.771
- No!
- Bitch!

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.003
<i>He answered her questions with blows.</i>

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.686
<i>As usual, she endured them.</i>

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.049
<i>And she waited for the storm to pass.</i>

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.770
What kind of time do you call this?

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.061
Linear time.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.329
<i>As the relentless day crept on,
the captain told his tale</i>

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.807
<i>of events beyond his understanding.</i>

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.888
<i>There was a rebellion in Ireland.</i>

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.008
<i>We were sent to crush it.</i>

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.451
Both of us were wounded
by the beggarly horde.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.567
My wounds were superficial,
but Darvell developed fever.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.882
<i>It decimated him.</i>

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.604
<i>I tried to persuade him to come home.</i>

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.683
<i>That was good of you.</i>

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.286
I knew the journey would quicken his decline.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.683
Darvell was rich,

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.205
naive.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.328
<i>He had no heir.</i>

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.023
<i>I had begun to wish him dead.</i>

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.208
<i>But before the grave took him,
two men entered his life.</i>

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.603
<i>Scholars, I presumed, of dead languages</i>

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.331
<i>and aged manuscripts.</i>

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.849
<i>As if ancient knowledge
might keep his death at bay.</i>

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.166
You have been looking
in the wrong place, my son.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.205
Here it is.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.890
Thank you.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.405
Thank you.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.203
<i>He told me we must find a shrine.</i>

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:22.170
An ancient myth said it had healing powers.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.130
It was on an empty island
off a barren coast.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.600
<i>I thought it the desperate quest
of a dying man.</i>

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.050
<i>It was a sinister black thumbnail</i>

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.362
<i>sticking out of the ocean,</i>

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.642
<i>more rock than island.</i>

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.286
<i>The oarsmen wouldn't set foot on the place.</i>

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.522
Said it was cursed.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.644
<i>The way was steep,
but Darvell kept on climbing regardless.</i>

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.127
<i>I thought, or maybe I hoped,</i>

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.691
<i>his heart would give way.</i>

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.848
Is this what you've dragged us here to find?

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.450
A hermit's hut?

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.768
<i>I hated that place.</i>

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.687
There were so many birds in the sky,
almost darkened the sun.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.167
<i>They seemed to know something we didn't.</i>

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.962
<i>He sent me to fetch water.</i>

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.167
<i>That was just a ruse.</i>

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.001
<i>I found the corpse.</i>

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.810
<i>His breath had gone.</i>

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.962
His soul had fled.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.250
And I ran.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.087
<i>I've never spoken of it since.</i>

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.850
<i>I took his rings.</i>

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.450
Hey!

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.161
<i>And when I returned, I took his property.</i>

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.962
Everything I own is his.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.407
What will he do?

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.885
<i>Bear in mind, Mr Kent,</i>

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.644
<i>this woman is not your sister-in-law.</i>

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.041
<i>She's dead. This is a shell.</i>

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.811
<i>And what it contains is pure evil.</i>

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.071
Oi!

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.044
<i>When we destroy it,
we destroy only the evil.</i>

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.681
- I'll go.
- No, no, no, no.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.365
I'll get it.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.166
Aren't you a little young?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.964
Eleanor, is she in?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.650
Why? What's it to you?

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.566
I read her story.
Can you tell her, please?

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.364
She's not in.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.085
Go on.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.089
Off you go.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.250
Ella.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.842
Look, I understand what Claire's
had to do, right,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.520
'cause there's money to be made, but...

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.881
If you don't like what Clara's doing,
tell her.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.321
You don't like it either.
Do you, hey?

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.525
Why's she like that?
Why's she so...

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.883
What happened to her, Ella?

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.125
- She got bitten by a vampire.
- Did I?

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.802
There was a boy for you at the door.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.724
I sent him on his way.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.609
He says he's read your story.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.331
- What story, Ella?
- The one we always tell.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.602
About the care home
and how my sister rescued me.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.330
It's homework.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.809
You frighten me sometimes.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.965
Don't.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.690
I won't.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.402
Fucking brilliant story.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.841
Thank you.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.446
But the assignment asked for truth.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.642
I didn't write it as an assignment.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.245
I wrote it for you.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.444
I don't want to lie anymore.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.045
Something has to change.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.929
But this...

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.770
It's crazy.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.930
I thought...

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.610
if I told...

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.762
all the walls would come tumbling down.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.604
Yes.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.169
I think... I get that you're using the story

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.766
to say that bad things happened.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.603
But... why don't you just say the truth?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.684
I am Eleanor Webb.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.969
I've given you my secret.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.284
I've told you how I live.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.522
Hello.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.331
Would you put the record on?

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.362
It's called <i>'Nacht und Träume'.</i>

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.684
Peace be with you.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.363
May light shine upon you.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.889
I think you should read this.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.847
I set this every year.
It's this simple autobiography.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.571
And then I get this amazing piece.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.405
It's as if Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:18.400
had got together and had
a very strange little child.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.204
"A true account of my making

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.002
"and my life and death
from the year of my birth, 1804."

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.324
You're kidding.

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:30.686
If that was a piece of fiction,
you'd say it was... it was...

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.880
dark, passionate, violent, sick,
brilliant bit of writing.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.407
But she's saying,
"This is who I am."

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.251
Which makes me think
there's something going on with her.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.323
She's a very closed-off kid.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.568
Well, she wants to communicate, obviously.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.245
I mean, look at the effort she's made.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.801
Her handwriting. Turn of phrase.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.804
I mean, who writes like this these days?

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.804
"As darkness fell,

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.247
"the soucriant returned."

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.324
<i>And Captain Ruthven prepared for the worst.</i>

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.129
I took these for safekeeping.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.004
Forgive me, my friend.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.131
Forgiveness is a Christian value, Ruthven.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:21.683
My gods are older.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.163
More ruthless.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.970
You died.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.327
How else does one find life eternal?

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.929
I sent you to fetch water.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.128
<i>And I met the nameless saint.</i>

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.449
This is what happens.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.244
When?

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.209
When you pray for it.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.566
<i>I rose and saw with different eyes.</i>

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.806
<i>Everything I looked on
was a source of wonder.</i>

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.123
<i>But my vision had a price.</i>

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.569
<i>My soul was lost.</i>

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.850
The price of my existence is this sacrifice.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.843
It flows from...

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.724
<i>It flows from blood.</i>

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.609
His blood is yours.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.165
Drink, my son.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.649
Mine is a cruel existence.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.641
But you do have the qualities one needs.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.806
You are ever...

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.445
a survivor.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.291
I would give my soul to be
as you are now.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.610
So be it.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.045
Eternal life...

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.447
will only come to those
prepared to die.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.640
- Hello.
- You want up?

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.325
Thanks.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.404
Have some fun now.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.690
Hello?

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.651
- Mr Minton.
- Hello, Noel.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.165
How are you?

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.960
What, have I got a detention or something?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.365
No.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.562
I'm actually trying to get some information

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.451
on one of our current students,
Eleanor Webb?

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.967
- She gave this as her address.
- Eleanor? Is everything OK?

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.771
We're trying to set up a meeting

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.843
with all the parties
interested in her welfare.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.604
Sure.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.245
Are her parents here?

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.364
No, you need to speak to Claire.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.562
She's Eleanor's big sister.
Claire's her legal guardian.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.249
- Is Claire here?
- No, she's...

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.061
busy.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.165
It's not what you think.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.845
It's Claire's business, right?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.162
She saves girls from the streets.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.971
The thing is, Noel,
Eleanor's written a story.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.569
And in her story, she says
that she lives with vampires.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.849
So can you please pass this letter on

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.209
and tell Claire that
if I don't hear from her today,

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.967
then I'll be in touch with Social Services

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.724
and the police.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.205
Shit.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.331
So Darvell gave the map and passage
to your mother?

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.442
No, to Captain Ruthven.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.561
<i>My mother saw her chance and took it.</i>

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.122
Bitch!

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.568
Bitch! Bitch!

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.281
<i>She stole the map and rode into the night...</i>

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.442
<i>towards her unknown future.</i>

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.164
And she made her way to where?
To this ruin?

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.245
And this 'soucriant' thing took her?

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.086
I didn't give you my story.
I've been betrayed into this.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.369
You can leave any time you like.

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.361
So when did Clara come back for you?

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.769
When I was 16.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.968
And what did she do in the meantime?

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.964
- She's never talked about it.
- Really?

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.609
She says she can't recall,
but I expect she's lying.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.289
Lying is a way of life to her.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.731
But I was raised in an orphanage

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.689
where I was taught to tell the truth.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.842
Are there others like you?

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.770
I've never met one.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.768
And Clara never speaks of any.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.882
I think we're the only two
who still endure.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.241
- How often do you feed?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:45.849
Thank you.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.765
That's the distasteful part
of being an immortal, isn't it?

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.247
If you don't believe a word I say,
why this pretence?

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.845
Eleanor.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.890
How can you be two centuries old?

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.647
By... by what miracle of science?

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.205
You see...

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.164
that's the tricky thing.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.323
Because it's only over time
that I can prove it.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.884
30, maybe 40 years from now,

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.249
when you're pruning roses
from your wheelchair...

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.123
I'll stroll by your garden gate

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.204
and say, "Hello, Morag."

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.729
And nothing will have changed.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.122
I am 16 forever.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.171
And you'll realise this,

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.687
and it will hurt your heart,

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.640
and I'll say,
"May peace be with you."

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.047
And I'll help you with the pain.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.125
Why don't you do it now?

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.362
I'm not strong.
You could overpower me.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.044
You're not ready.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.445
How do you do it?

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.571
Where are your fangs?

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.326
Why don't you die in the daylight?

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.648
How could you give my story
to those people?

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.445
- I wrote it for you.
- How do you kill?

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.290
I never.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.811
People have to consent.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.849
They have to want.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.889
Want death?

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.201
- It has to be an act of...
- Who the fuck wants death?

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.044
Sometimes it releases people.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.964
- So you're moral?
- No.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.287
- I'm ruthless.
- Bullshit.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.005
All this, "I'm 206, I remember everything,
and it's a burden."

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:13.610
It's pathetic.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.046
My mum's giving me a birthday party.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.689
It's not really a party
'cause I'm only inviting you.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.609
- Will you come?
- Yes.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.524
Good.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.043
Hi.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.884
Happy birthday.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.890
For you.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.009
Do I have to invite you in?

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.165
You'd better come in.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.885
Hello again, Eleanor.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.610
Hello.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.208
Seriously, you can try if you like.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.887
I was hoping to arrange
a more official meeting,

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.644
Ideally with the school counsellor

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.370
and with Eleanor herself.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.925
Well, what's the problem?

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:14.004
'Cause, you know, usually
she sails through school.

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.050
Well, Eleanor wrote her life story...

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.686
and she's quite insistent
that it's true.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.968
I don't expect you to be flattered by this,

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.884
but in it, she describes you
as a soucriant,

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.168
which I believe is a sort of vampire.

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.084
Well!

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.449
She has got a great imagination.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.803
I hope she gets top marks.
Who else has read it?

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.769
You have sole care of her, don't you?

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:40.400
That boy, Frank. I bet he's read it.

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.360
Quite a responsibility for somebody so young.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.126
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.770
So, I shoot the bastard Ruthven

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.729
and I nick the map, and then what?

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.609
Well, it ends.
She doesn't say, does she?

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.330
That's 'cause I never told her.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.684
Shall we arrange a more formal meeting?

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:05.280
I saw that Ruthven wasn't dead.
I should have killed him then.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.130
But I had mercy on the cunt.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.443
Now, hold that thought,
because I'll tell you what he did.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:16.202
But first, shall I tell you
what it was like for me?

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.805
OK.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.281
It was wonderful.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.523
I had eyes that cut through lies,

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.001
lungs that breathed eternity.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.369
I felt I'd lived my whole wretched life

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.801
just to prepare me for that moment.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.890
It was easy.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.050
Where's Ruthven?

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.090
He wasn't worthy of your gift.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.049
You stole it?

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.890
Are we thieves now?

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.963
Do we steal time?

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.809
We buy it.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.530
With blood.

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:50.289
We are a brotherhood.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.602
There are no women amongst us.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.811
<i>What is her parentage?</i>

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:59.089
- It is low.
- And her life before?

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.088
- She made ends meet...
- I was a harlot.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.961
But that is in the past.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.531
Some things are eternal.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.409
You were to find a man of good blood

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.762
who appreciates this brotherhood
and what we do.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.445
What is it you do?

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.045
We are the pointed nails of justice.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.249
How will you use this gift?

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:25.369
To punish those who prey on the weak,

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.403
to curb the power of men.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.327
We should not permit her to survive.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.964
We have no choice.

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.043
Unless she breaks our code.

01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:38.965
You have no part in our order.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.690
Truly, you're base.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.127
Will you not speak for me?

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.087
<i>They banished me.</i>

01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:59.164
<i>I learnt that immortality
is unendurable alone.</i>

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.209
<i>So I came back.</i>

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.607
<i>I watched my daughter grow.</i>

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.331
<i>She was my only link
with everything alive.</i>

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.285
Back to sleep.

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.084
Back to sleep.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.890
You.

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.684
Come on.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:35.087
It was because of Eleanor
I broke their code.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.811
How did you do that?

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.281
A woman's not permitted to create.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:44.368
I took my darling to the nameless isle

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:46.927
and I let the thing save her.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.851
And for that,
they would annihilate us both.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.564
You see, I had made a fatal error.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.291
I'd been merciful.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.731
I'd let Ruthven live.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.211
<i>Eleanor!</i>

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.011
Eleanor!

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.362
Give my regards to your mother.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.009
And welcome to a slow death.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.605
Eleanor!

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.761
Welcome, whore.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:19.968
No!

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.408
Die! Die!

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.688
Now you know everything.

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.808
I'm never merciful.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.406
And knowledge is a fatal thing.

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.924
When I was born,
there were only seven planets.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:54.243
Neptune hadn't been discovered,
so nobody believed in it.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.729
Heaven and earth are full of things
we don't yet understand.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.570
I had a year of chemotherapy.

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.290
Which was too much time lying in my bed.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.090
So...

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.449
I made this.

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.285
That's you.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.648
Near the sun.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.802
Where it's warm and bright.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.404
And that's me.

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.361
Where light barely penetrates.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.524
And it's cold.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:52.804
And time moves so slowly.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.690
You're not cold.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:10.688
Everything outside of time is cold.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.567
If you kiss me right now...

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.729
will I live forever?

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.570
I'm sorry.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.165
Wait!

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.085
Stop!

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.209
Why do you always run away from me?

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.771
If you stay with me, you'll die.

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.809
I'm dying anyway.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:34.850
It isn't life I offer you.
Do you understand that?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.604
You'll take life.

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.762
By consent, like you do.

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.127
It's still monstrous.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.169
You'll leave everything behind.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.405
Except you.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.250
Come here.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.208
The gift I gave you, open it.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.249
Wait until I knock.

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.690
Kevin?

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.324
Do you want to come to...

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.122
There you are.
I've been worried sick.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.931
Look. Claire's not happy.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:40.889
I've made changes,
sent the girls home,

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.883
bought 'em tickets on the Eurostar.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.644
It's gonna be a clean house now.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.644
- Noel, I'm leaving.
- What are you talking about?

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.165
What do you think you're doing,

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.840
telling that fucking school who we are?

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.803
I hate the way you speak.
It makes me sick!

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.564
How dare you put us in such danger?

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.882
You told that fucking teacher our story!

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.281
I listened to his crap
about your fantasies of death,

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:02.046
and all the while,
he was implying my neglect.

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.044
- Neglect, Eleanor, of you!
- Stop it, Claire!

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.249
There is a rule that we live by!
And you broke it!

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:10.448
- What if I broke free?
- No!

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.005
To tell another is forbidden.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.571
Those with knowledge have to die.

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.449
You made that rule
so you could isolate me.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.085
No, I've kept you safe!

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.403
You stupid fucking cunt, Mother!
I hate you!

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.410
- No, no, no, no, no! Leave her!
- Ella! Get off me!

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.570
- Come back, Ella! Ella!
- Can't you leave her alone?

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.449
- Just...
- Eleanor!

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.847
- Claire!
- No, you can't leave!

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.048
- You're making it worse!
- It's not safe, Eleanor!

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:37.850
You can't leave!

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.650
Claire, just leave her be!

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.527
- No!
- Clara?

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.762
- You can't leave! It's not safe!
- Clara.

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.063
She has every right to go!

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.006
No!

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.802
- <i>Know where she lives?</i>
- Yes.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.123
I believe it's a hotel on the seafront.

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.089
- Does she trust you?
- Maybe.

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.766
- I've never lied to her.
- That's good.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.763
What will happen?

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.570
She'll be taken somewhere safe.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.125
We just want to talk to her.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.885
You've told your little boyfriend

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:17.405
- all about us, haven't you?
- No!

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.648
You know what happens
to those with knowledge, Ella!

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:21.689
- No, Clara, don't!
- It's like a virus.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.888
It's deadly, needs to be stamped out.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.281
- Clara, please, don't!
- I know where he lives!

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.841
Don't! Clara, don't go!

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.326
Clara! Clara!

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.451
Hello...

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.244
Frank.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.084
Where's Eleanor?

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.561
She's got a message for you.
Can I come in?

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.966
Well, you're gonna have to come out here,
then, aren't you?

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.449
I must say, you are definitely Ella's type.

01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.645
Earnest, clueless, about as sexy
as a pair of shoes.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.406
I knew you wouldn't let her go
without a fight.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.321
Is that what you're suggesting, Frank?

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:18.930
A fight?

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.401
Go on. Finish me.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.046
I still have the advantage.

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.647
She's going to leave you anyway.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.121
<i>Frank, Clara's coming.</i>

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.647
Don't answer the door.
Don't let her in.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.165
I'm trapped here.
She caught me.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.731
<i>Just don't let her get you.</i>

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.723
It's too late, my love.

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.245
I will never forgive.

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.687
I will never, ever forgive!

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.089
Eleanor! What the hell is going on?

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.890
It's Clara. You have to stop her.

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.565
These men are looking for her.
Where is she?

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.006
- <i>She's here.</i>
- Ella.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.128
Eleanor, you have to tell us the truth.

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.691
Something terrible has happened to Kevin.

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.241
- Clara Webb?
- Who is this?

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.243
<i>You know who we are, whore mother.</i>

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.811
I will take care of Eleanor now.

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.328
Ella! Ella!

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:27.967
These men are from the police, Eleanor.
They've come to help.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.362
- We have to get to Frank.
- We will get to Frank.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.722
We need to get you to a doctor, Eleanor.
Don't run!

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.848
What are you doing?
We need to get to Frank.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.765
You don't need handcuffs!
She's a child.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.241
- Eleanor, I'm coming with you.
- Be calm.

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.770
I will be with you whatever happens.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.251
There's no need to be afraid.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.323
Of course not.

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.170
It's a privilege to meet you, Eleanor.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.807
I thought Clara and I
were the only ones.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.008
Surely she told you of the brotherhood.

01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:20.088
Excuse me? What are you saying?

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.722
Darvell. You're just as I imagined.

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.245
Help me.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.920
Where exactly are you taking us?

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.122
Because we've just gone
right past the police station

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.203
and the hospital.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.771
Seriously, where are we going?

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.063
Eleanor!

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.968
Eleanor!

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.521
- Ella! Ella!
- Mother!

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.445
They'll destroy you, Ella!
They'll destroy you!

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.281
Darvell, let her go!

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:48.685
Mother!

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.081
- Darvell, let her go!
- Mother!

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.642
Now I'm going to show you,
piece of whore.

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:00.324
Yes!

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:03.361
Oh, my God, you killed her.

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.325
Nothing is that easy.

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.805
Mother!

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.371
- Mother!
- With this act,

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:14.889
I cleanse the earth!

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.966
- Mother!
- No!

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:26.851
Be calm. Be calm.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.650
Who are you people?

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.848
I said be calm!

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.924
I hate these crying women.

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.970
Damn you.

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.127
I've followed you for many years.

01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.931
You take only those who are ready.

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.208
And that has a certain grace.

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.611
You have been condemned
from the moment Clara made you.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.888
Our code does not permit women to create.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.163
In her stories, you were wonderful.

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.130
You had compassion and respect.

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.044
You gave her life.

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.850
She stole her life.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.927
Please. Please stop him.

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.811
She killed one of the brethren,
and that's unforgivable.

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.530
Don't go.

01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.808
Amazing how two little girls
with no money and learning

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.201
slipped through your fingers
for an eternity.

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.965
- Hold her down!
- Ella!

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.521
- Hold her down.
- No! No! No!

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.569
No!

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:12.404
No! Ella!

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:15.729
Ella! Ella!

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.564
Eleanor!

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:20.166
- Stop it!
- Bring it here.

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:23.005
Bring it here.
Isn't the present everything?

01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.201
Ella!

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.089
This is your last night, witch.

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.163
- Darvell!
- Last night!

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.084
Eleanor!

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:55.689
This blade is from Byzantium.
My souvenir of the Crusades.

01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.722
May it send you to eternity.

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.167
It was on a beach like this
that we first met.

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:05.127
But I went with Ruthven,
for all my damnation.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.289
But it was you.

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.602
You were the pearl.

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.889
See how the bitch uses her arts
to the last?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.241
The honour is yours.

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.090
Do what you like with me,
but let her go, please!

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.561
- Hold her still.
- Please! I beg you, Darvell!

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:27.563
- Still, I said.
- She's going to die anyway.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.563
She can't survive on her own.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:31.449
Eleanor!

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.608
My baby!

01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.683
You truly are a wonder.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.530
I've been following you for years,
so assiduously.

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.564
Because if I wasn't the one to find you,

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.245
they certainly would have killed you.

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.283
What will they do, the others?

01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.607
The brotherhood is strong.

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.125
Unchanging.

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.248
They will come.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.687
With their pointed nails of justice.

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.766
Will he travel with us now?

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.529
You're not coming with us.

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.650
What?

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.330
I'm cutting you loose.

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.291
You can't stay with your mother
all your life, can you?

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:19.690
Come on.

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.804
Come here.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.530
Go on.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.444
Look forward, not back.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.844
Always.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.770
Your instinct is to hunt the powerful
and protect the weak.

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.766
I'd like to try and live that way.

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:13.526
Live your life how you choose.
It's no concern of mine.

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.970
If you could have anything,
what would it be?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.889
Your pardon.

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.850
In time. Maybe.

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.329
Your company, then?

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.044
We have time.

01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.004
I'm afraid.

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.610
Don't be.

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.522
<i>I am Eleanor Webb.</i>

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:10.645
<i>I throw my story to the wind,
and never will I tell it more.</i>

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.122
<i>Another one begins.</i>

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:59.000
<i>Lully, lullay
Thou little, tiny child</i>

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:09.120
<i>Bye-bye, lully, lullay</i>

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:17.960
<i>O sisters too
How may we do</i>

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:27.640
<i>For to preserve this day?</i>

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:37.160
<i>This poor youngling
for whom we do sing</i>

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:46.408
<i>Bye-bye, lully, lullay.</i>

01:55:47.305 --> 01:55:53.278
