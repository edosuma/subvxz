00:00.789 --> 00:01.900
I think you were right.

00:01.924 --> 00:03.789
Danny was murdered, and not just Danny.

00:03.939 --> 00:05.531
- All those people.
- So what do we do?

00:05.556 --> 00:08.456
- We need Alex on our side.
- That is all confidential.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.726
People are dying. I'm not
prepared to ignore that.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.568
If we can get the staff rotas,

00:12.593 --> 00:14.520
see who was on shift when
the deaths occurred...

00:14.726 --> 00:16.720
These terminals are strictly staff only.

00:16.745 --> 00:19.265
You haven't seen my ID card, have
you? I can't find it anywhere.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.126
Sharp scratch.

00:22.788 --> 00:24.955
You have been stealing
medication from the ward.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.999
I am going to tell you
what we are going to do,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.631
otherwise all of this is going
to get very complicated for you.

00:30.851 --> 00:32.453
- Zoe...
- I can't talk to you.

00:33.047 --> 00:34.095
This is three or four times

00:34.119 --> 00:36.156
the recommended dose of
a powerful anti-psychotic.

00:36.324 --> 00:37.484
I'm removing this now.

00:37.509 --> 00:39.844
I have the full support of
the clinical lead on this.

00:40.005 --> 00:42.445
If enemy combatants
were killed unlawfully,

00:42.617 --> 00:43.977
then a crime has been committed,

00:44.102 --> 00:45.906
which is why this
investigation continues

00:45.931 --> 00:47.329
with a view to a possible court martial.

00:47.509 --> 00:49.060
You're telling me you
only just noticed this?

00:49.084 --> 00:51.342
I'll write up the antibiotics
and fluids for you now.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.267
Zoe...

00:53.729 --> 00:54.838
Shit!

00:55.877 --> 00:57.815
I've got nothing. Get some help!

- Right arm's just blown. No access.
- Shit!

01:10.834 --> 01:11.840
That's two minutes.

01:12.493 --> 01:14.653
OK, white needle.

01:17.402 --> 01:19.024
- Back on the chest?
- Wait.

01:27.493 --> 01:28.815
We should restart CPR.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.081
Zoe...

01:32.435 --> 01:33.612
Doctor!

01:38.281 --> 01:40.640
OK, there's an output.
We're back in business.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.946
Get me a BM, manual BP
and one litre of dextrose IV.

01:45.086 --> 01:46.664
We're going to need more 10% glucose.

01:46.776 --> 01:48.050
All the glucagon we have in the fridge.

01:48.074 --> 01:49.416
Call ITU for more if we need it.

02:34.661 --> 02:36.021
Are you OK?

02:40.161 --> 02:41.222
How is he?

02:42.712 --> 02:44.151
It was a massive overdose.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.519
Took all the glucagon we had
just to get his sugars detectable.

02:49.089 --> 02:51.105
Someone knew exactly
what they were doing.

02:51.573 --> 02:52.596
Same pattern...

02:52.995 --> 02:55.676
would have been the same result
if I hadn't been there to save him.

02:56.909 --> 02:58.189
Say I buy it.

02:59.636 --> 03:01.253
We have a murderer in our midst.

03:02.369 --> 03:03.496
Then who?

03:07.557 --> 03:09.074
Who's blocked this at every turn?

03:09.718 --> 03:11.699
Refused to take my concerns seriously,

03:11.724 --> 03:13.691
then tried to pressure
me into keeping quiet?

03:14.656 --> 03:15.722
Archie Watson?

03:17.684 --> 03:18.863
Killing his own patients?

03:19.168 --> 03:23.777
- Why not? Because he's one of us?
- No, but... Jesus.

03:27.443 --> 03:30.308
You do know absolutely
none of this makes sense?

03:30.736 --> 03:31.949
Not to you, maybe.

03:33.495 --> 03:35.820
I stink. I need a shower.

03:51.427 --> 03:53.773
- How's he looking?
- Good.

03:54.286 --> 03:56.989
Amazing really, considering.
He's a tough guy.

03:57.831 --> 03:59.754
Mm-hm. So people keep telling me.

04:00.638 --> 04:01.638
Chest?

04:02.789 --> 04:03.795
I'll have a listen.

04:59.850 --> 05:00.951
What are you doing?

05:02.164 --> 05:04.891
Drip's tissued. Thought
I'd give it a flush.

05:06.725 --> 05:08.179
It's just salty water.

05:09.660 --> 05:10.953
There, all done.

05:11.556 --> 05:12.562
Where's Zoe?

05:13.992 --> 05:15.937
Taking a shower after saving your life.

05:17.257 --> 05:18.351
You've had a tough time.

05:19.869 --> 05:21.820
You take it easy, you hear?

05:23.045 --> 05:24.062
We can talk later.

05:25.703 --> 05:27.414
Yeah, I agree. Much better.

05:27.638 --> 05:30.398
In fact, I think we can move him back
to the main ward now, don't you?

05:35.371 --> 05:37.652
- At least he's alive.
- Oh, thank God for that.

05:38.823 --> 05:40.456
What the hell is going on here?

05:40.862 --> 05:42.612
Matt, Danny, and now this?

05:43.939 --> 05:46.464
Do you know how hard I have
worked to build this place up?

05:46.863 --> 05:49.323
I know, I've watched you.

05:49.489 --> 05:52.675
Dr Watson, can I have a
word with you in private?

05:53.495 --> 05:55.038
I-I've got work to do.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.438
She hadn't even checked the level.

06:06.922 --> 06:09.079
Almost as if she already
knew it was going to be low.

06:10.957 --> 06:12.996
And it was Zoe who signed
out the last saline bag

06:13.021 --> 06:15.118
before he arrested. I double checked.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.462
You're not suggesting that Zoe had
anything to do with this, are you?

06:20.747 --> 06:22.462
It just seems strange, that's all.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.282
Thank you. I'll look into it.

06:42.721 --> 06:43.755
Hi.

06:47.402 --> 06:48.552
So what happened?

06:49.834 --> 06:51.193
Someone tried to kill you.

06:54.550 --> 06:56.186
You say it like it's a bad thing.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.537
Shouldn't you be at home?

07:04.423 --> 07:05.537
Not tonight.

07:06.893 --> 07:07.896
You need to sleep.

07:08.686 --> 07:09.709
Doctor's orders.

08:08.216 --> 08:09.776
Sorry, bud, nothing for you.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.879
Everything OK?

08:13.574 --> 08:14.582
Long shift.

08:24.196 --> 08:25.411
I'm awake.

08:33.717 --> 08:35.582
God, I need a cigarette.

08:37.014 --> 08:38.207
You told Alex?

08:39.001 --> 08:40.020
And he believes you?

08:40.534 --> 08:43.926
Honestly, I don't know
what he believes, or who.

08:45.383 --> 08:46.418
So what do we do?

08:47.778 --> 08:48.938
You nearly died.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.336
If I hadn't been there, you...

08:53.156 --> 08:55.590
Whatever it takes, we
have to stop this now.

08:57.087 --> 08:59.825
I'll go, with the evidence,
and talk to the police.

09:00.684 --> 09:03.200
- You think they'll take us seriously?
- No idea.

09:03.701 --> 09:05.832
But I don't think we
have a choice. Do you?

09:15.642 --> 09:16.825
Here's Dr Wade now.

09:19.714 --> 09:20.832
Dr Wade?

09:21.626 --> 09:22.641
Yes?

09:22.863 --> 09:24.672
Can we talk to you, in private?

09:26.139 --> 09:27.148
Sure.

09:49.128 --> 09:50.141
What's going on?

09:50.360 --> 09:51.414
Dr Wade,

09:51.583 --> 09:53.481
we're investigating a report of a series

09:53.506 --> 09:55.465
of suspicious deaths at this hospital.

09:56.101 --> 09:58.051
We need to interview you under caution.

09:58.804 --> 10:00.601
Why? Why me?

10:01.193 --> 10:04.112
I know this is a shock for you, Zoe.
If you cooperate with the police,

10:04.137 --> 10:05.777
I'm sure that would
be best for your case.

10:06.530 --> 10:07.562
I'm a suspect?!

10:07.587 --> 10:09.507
We are genuinely concerned for you.

10:09.787 --> 10:11.351
All any of us want is the truth.

10:12.842 --> 10:14.121
No. No, you can't do this.

10:15.343 --> 10:18.569
- Talk to him, it's him.
- Just take it easy, love, OK?

10:18.594 --> 10:20.483
Don't you see? It's
him that's doing this.

10:20.799 --> 10:21.992
He's doing this!

10:39.846 --> 10:40.898
Name, please.

10:44.092 --> 10:47.547
Look, love, it's easier for
all of us if you cooperate.

10:50.672 --> 10:51.672
Zoe Wade.

10:52.256 --> 10:53.922
Is that Miss or Mrs?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
Doctor.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.022
I want to call Alex. He's my fiance.

10:59.175 --> 11:00.451
Yeah, yeah. We'll get to that.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.461
Permanent address?

11:04.729 --> 11:07.588
So you gave James McCain
a shot of glucose?

11:08.324 --> 11:09.611
That's just simple sugar, right?

11:10.324 --> 11:12.245
Well, it's a little bit
more complicated than...

11:14.532 --> 11:15.946
- Yes.
- And in doing so,

11:15.971 --> 11:17.157
you've saved his life?

11:17.586 --> 11:18.602
I did my job.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.259
According to the nurses,

11:21.326 --> 11:23.891
you didn't actually check a
sugar level during the arrest,

11:24.445 --> 11:26.485
so you had no way of knowing
it was going to be low.

11:26.631 --> 11:28.016
There have been other cases,

11:28.215 --> 11:30.016
patients with low blood sugar arresting.

11:30.793 --> 11:33.933
I've reported it. To... Dr Watson.

11:34.197 --> 11:36.269
He's my consultant. My boss.

11:36.492 --> 11:40.613
Because you believed someone as
deliberately harming patients?

11:42.261 --> 11:43.917
I thought it was a possibility.

11:44.185 --> 11:45.933
Then why not go directly to the police,

11:46.259 --> 11:48.066
if you had such significant concerns?

11:49.647 --> 11:54.646
I was advised not to by Dr Watson.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.636
I raised all my concerns with
him. You should talk to Dr Watson.

11:57.711 --> 12:00.195
We did. Actually, he's
been very helpful.

12:01.273 --> 12:04.437
I understand you recently
had some issues.

12:05.969 --> 12:07.186
Mental health issues.

12:08.343 --> 12:10.351
I mean, obviously, there's
absolutely no stigma

12:10.376 --> 12:11.696
- attached to that...
- Obviously!

12:11.764 --> 12:13.085
Perhaps you'd like to
tell us a little more.

12:13.109 --> 12:14.140
That's my business.

12:14.957 --> 12:15.992
It's not relevant to this.

12:16.016 --> 12:18.468
Even when you've been stealing
prescription medication

12:18.493 --> 12:19.853
and using it while on duty?

12:23.712 --> 12:24.741
That was a mistake.

12:25.554 --> 12:26.569
I've...

12:27.323 --> 12:29.643
I've been under a lot of pressure.
I've not been sleeping.

12:30.643 --> 12:32.119
I'm supposed to be getting married.

12:36.037 --> 12:37.408
Like I said, it was a mistake.

12:37.595 --> 12:39.994
- Do you make many mistakes, Dr Wade?
- No!

12:40.766 --> 12:42.305
I don't think so. I hope not.

12:42.624 --> 12:45.083
The hospital records confirm
that you were on duty when

12:45.108 --> 12:48.641
James McGill suffered a cardiac
arrest and died shortly afterwards.

12:49.110 --> 12:52.225
There's Matthew Helm who was
injured and still remains in a coma.

12:52.351 --> 12:54.484
Also when Danny Adams
suffered a similar fate.

12:55.364 --> 12:56.797
I wasn't there when Danny died.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.836
We've tracked your electronic
ID card and it confirms

12:59.869 --> 13:02.492
you were on the unit at the time
of all the relevant incidents.

13:02.904 --> 13:04.312
My ID card went missing.

13:04.631 --> 13:07.562
Did you administer a fatal
overdose to Danny Adams?

13:08.547 --> 13:11.437
Danny was my patient and my friend.

13:11.605 --> 13:14.953
And Jamie McCain, is he a friend too?

13:16.700 --> 13:18.381
You're friends with a
lot of your patients.

13:19.509 --> 13:20.828
I work in rehabilitation.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.031
Relationships develop, it's what we do.

13:23.696 --> 13:26.133
So, yes, and I'm proud of it.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.651
More doctors should care
about the people they treat.

13:29.230 --> 13:32.309
Have you heard of the
saviour complex, Dr Wade?

13:32.568 --> 13:33.568
No.

13:33.593 --> 13:36.310
It seems that there are some
health care professionals

13:37.045 --> 13:39.787
who become addicted to
saving their patients' lives.

13:40.271 --> 13:43.388
The only problem is that
means risking them first.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.029
Sometimes it goes wrong
so innocent people die.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.598
This is ridiculous!

13:51.138 --> 13:53.505
I was the one who raised it,
I've been trying to stop it!

13:54.313 --> 13:56.810
I'm being set up, don't
you see? It's obvious!

13:57.954 --> 14:00.141
It's Watson who's doing
this, you should talk to him.

14:00.217 --> 14:02.118
Get him in here! Talk to Watson!

14:03.223 --> 14:04.321
What the hell's going on?

14:05.242 --> 14:06.500
I was acting on information

14:06.525 --> 14:08.680
I felt duty bound to pass
on to the authorities.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.367
- What information?
- It's confidential.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.950
They've just had my
fiancee arrested for murder.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.466
Don't tell me it's fucking confidential.

14:20.462 --> 14:22.200
We all make bad choices in life, Alex.

14:22.225 --> 14:23.927
We want to help people
who can't be helped,

14:24.461 --> 14:26.513
protect people who
aren't worth our shelter.

14:27.389 --> 14:29.989
The trick is knowing
when to cut and run.

14:37.786 --> 14:38.793
Hiya.

14:43.158 --> 14:45.036
You know, I admire you.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.286
You're a very resilient
young man, Jamie.

14:53.157 --> 14:54.408
Why have they taken Zoe?

14:55.149 --> 14:56.384
I want to speak to her.

14:58.156 --> 15:00.597
I imagine when you first met
me, you didn't like me very much.

15:01.055 --> 15:03.791
A lot of patients transfer
their anger from their condition

15:03.962 --> 15:05.642
to the people that are
trying to help them.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.236
I know you've become close to Dr Wade.

15:10.259 --> 15:12.853
That makes what I'm
about to say even harder.

15:14.558 --> 15:16.001
Unfortunately...

15:16.896 --> 15:18.872
we now suspect she's
the one who's been...

15:19.333 --> 15:20.708
harming some of her patients.

15:20.744 --> 15:21.810
No! That's bullshit.

15:22.711 --> 15:24.710
She's been trying to
stop it. We both have.

15:24.954 --> 15:27.474
The police are now involved and
we're leaving it in their hands.

15:27.987 --> 15:30.240
The evidence strongly suggests she's...

15:31.327 --> 15:32.927
a very disturbed young woman.

15:33.046 --> 15:35.022
No, that's not true.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.529
I need to talk to her.

15:37.724 --> 15:39.139
I'm afraid...

15:39.400 --> 15:42.391
that's both impossible...

15:43.008 --> 15:44.656
and counterproductive.

15:45.302 --> 15:48.100
When a doctor betrays a patient's
trust, well, I for one think

15:48.125 --> 15:49.231
there's no worse crime.

15:49.731 --> 15:50.903
You can't do this to her.

15:52.086 --> 15:53.114
I'm leaving now.

15:53.861 --> 15:55.700
I'll sign something. I don't care.

15:55.901 --> 15:58.372
I want to get out of here
now and you can't stop me.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.231
I understand you're scared and confused.

16:02.301 --> 16:04.278
But I'm afraid that's impossible.

16:04.605 --> 16:05.636
You're under section,

16:06.084 --> 16:07.476
and under the terms of
the Mental Health Act...

16:07.500 --> 16:08.500
Fuck that!

16:09.311 --> 16:12.420
If it's all true, if someone's doing
this, then I'm not crazy, right?

16:12.445 --> 16:13.804
So you can't keep me here.

16:14.356 --> 16:16.235
I know it's not easy sometimes,

16:16.291 --> 16:18.248
but we're all just here
to try and help you.

16:22.294 --> 16:24.214
I believe the police will
want to speak with you.

16:26.299 --> 16:27.623
If Jamie wasn't deluded,

16:27.648 --> 16:30.021
we have no grounds to
either treat or detain him.

16:30.641 --> 16:31.834
I'll examine him again.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.475
If I believe he should no
longer be under section,

16:34.500 --> 16:36.146
then that's what I'm going to recommend.

16:36.950 --> 16:37.959
Thank you.

16:38.457 --> 16:42.170
But as lead clinician in this
unit, I've made my decision.

16:43.195 --> 16:45.928
We'll review the section again
in 30 days as is customary.

16:46.509 --> 16:49.193
Until then, he stays
exactly where he is.

16:49.419 --> 16:50.899
And if I don't agree?

16:52.111 --> 16:54.389
I just don't see how that's
relevant now. Do you?

17:26.079 --> 17:27.102
Come on, Doc.

17:35.733 --> 17:36.743
Hi.

17:37.380 --> 17:38.524
It's OK, I'm here.

17:39.578 --> 17:40.617
Thank you.

17:41.043 --> 17:42.110
Don't thank me.

17:46.895 --> 17:49.019
- You called Bobby?
- He's the only lawyer I know.

17:49.976 --> 17:50.980
Christ!

17:52.993 --> 17:54.191
I want to go home.

17:54.470 --> 17:57.349
RADIO: Today police were called
to a local rehabilitation unit

17:57.420 --> 17:59.972
in response to a series
of unexplained deaths.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.138
There are unconfirmed
reports that a member of staff

18:03.258 --> 18:04.841
has already been detained.

18:05.604 --> 18:08.771
Police have declined to name the
suspect but social media sources

18:08.796 --> 18:11.404
have identified a female
doctor in her 20s.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.278
The investigation is ongoing.

18:28.793 --> 18:31.933
The two of you had developed
a relationship of sorts.

18:32.343 --> 18:34.144
I just told her about what Danny said.

18:35.271 --> 18:38.333
He had evidence, statistics.
I didn't understand them.

18:39.483 --> 18:43.192
At first she didn't believe me but
then she agreed it checked out.

18:43.479 --> 18:44.999
And, so, you then informed the police?

18:46.164 --> 18:47.164
No.

18:48.430 --> 18:49.789
Zoe wanted to handle it.

18:50.654 --> 18:51.664
Check it was real.

18:52.552 --> 18:54.336
I think she was nervous,
you know, about...

18:55.619 --> 18:56.666
blowing the whistle.

18:57.518 --> 18:59.627
So you're saying she
encouraged you to say nothing?

19:00.237 --> 19:02.166
No, not exactly. I think she just...

19:03.614 --> 19:04.614
wanted to be sure.

19:11.243 --> 19:12.483
This isn't her.

19:14.310 --> 19:17.162
Whoever is doing this, it isn't Zoe.

19:17.726 --> 19:20.841
The serious incident with Matthew Helm.

19:22.253 --> 19:24.146
A sharp object had
been placed in his bed.

19:24.574 --> 19:26.763
He had a seizure. She tried to help him.

19:26.788 --> 19:28.028
But she was first on the scene?

19:30.606 --> 19:31.615
Yes.

19:33.587 --> 19:34.826
Need some help here!

19:35.508 --> 19:37.458
- This was an accident?
- Sure, of course.

19:43.055 --> 19:44.101
DC Crockett.

19:45.105 --> 19:46.133
Uh-huh...

19:46.769 --> 19:50.273
I think both you and Danny
Adams got close to the truth.

19:52.428 --> 19:55.289
The only mistake you made
was trusting the person

19:55.314 --> 19:57.125
who was in fact committing the crimes.

20:00.290 --> 20:01.290
No.

20:02.246 --> 20:05.369
You're saying Danny Adams
was collecting mortality data.

20:06.157 --> 20:08.720
I really can't let you keep
another patient's property.

20:09.151 --> 20:11.970
Trust me and don't talk
to anyone else about it.

20:12.182 --> 20:13.689
You know the truth can't hurt you.

20:14.168 --> 20:15.769
Unless you really
have something to hide.

20:16.859 --> 20:17.996
You're lying to me.

20:18.277 --> 20:19.402
She's a pretty girl.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.183
Clever too, right? A bit special.

20:25.487 --> 20:26.800
It's forensics. We've got her.

20:27.461 --> 20:28.862
Right. We're still at the hospital.

20:30.589 --> 20:31.789
Thank you.

20:59.503 --> 21:02.355
- Soup's up.
- I'm fine.

21:03.317 --> 21:04.638
You should try and eat something.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.839
Doctor's orders.

21:08.998 --> 21:10.651
Did you talk to Bobby about a barrister?

21:12.055 --> 21:13.072
Not yet.

21:15.204 --> 21:17.651
I mean, we don't even know
what's going to happen with this.

21:18.546 --> 21:21.420
It's Watson. He's set me up. I know it!

21:22.488 --> 21:24.728
That's why we need to fight
this with everything we have.

21:26.158 --> 21:27.798
You know you can always
be honest with me.

21:28.545 --> 21:32.405
- Hope so.
- No, what I mean is, I'd prefer it.

21:33.967 --> 21:36.818
Whatever the truth,
you won't be abandoned.

21:38.780 --> 21:40.482
What we've had has
meant too much for that.

21:41.456 --> 21:43.816
- Had.
- You know, the two of us.

21:45.022 --> 21:46.620
There will be grounds for mitigation.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.198
Bobby's already confirmed that.

21:51.957 --> 21:53.596
I'm just asking you for your honesty

21:54.245 --> 21:58.346
so that we can deal with
this... thing together.

22:04.925 --> 22:07.431
Leave it. More bloody reporters.

22:12.182 --> 22:14.516
And I want to know what's changed.

22:14.623 --> 22:15.824
You've already questioned her.

22:16.023 --> 22:18.422
Well, like I said, new forensic
evidence has come to light.

22:18.892 --> 22:20.571
So, what, now she's being charged?

22:20.647 --> 22:22.712
That's a decision that'll
be made in custody.

22:23.308 --> 22:25.782
Dr Wade, you can either
cooperate or we will arrest you.

22:26.156 --> 22:27.368
It's OK. I'll talk to you.

22:28.584 --> 22:30.225
Call Bobby. Get him
to meet us over there.

22:30.777 --> 22:31.786
Sure.

22:32.146 --> 22:33.826
I just need to use the
bathroom first. OK?

22:33.900 --> 22:34.935
No problem.

22:38.908 --> 22:40.689
- Don't lock it.
- OK.

23:08.766 --> 23:09.908
OK. Let's go.

23:21.311 --> 23:22.611
Call it in! She's running!

23:32.424 --> 23:35.314
The forensic lab found two
needle holes in the saline bag,

23:35.339 --> 23:37.337
enough to deliver a fatal dose,

23:37.648 --> 23:39.568
and apparently her
fingerprints were all over it.

23:40.082 --> 23:42.025
When the police came, she absconded.

23:42.931 --> 23:45.197
They tell me her ID badge
data checked out too.

23:45.610 --> 23:48.305
Every instant, every suspicious
death, Zoe was there.

23:48.742 --> 23:52.499
Look, this needn't reflect
badly on you, Alex. It's just...

23:53.809 --> 23:56.210
It's a desperately sad
situation for everybody.

23:57.149 --> 23:58.790
I know you've tried
to do the right thing.

23:59.343 --> 24:01.312
You'll continue to have my full support

24:01.542 --> 24:03.182
when the great and
the good come knocking.

24:04.733 --> 24:06.854
You've a great career ahead
of you never forget that.

24:07.609 --> 24:10.967
In the meantime, my advice to you
is to look after number one. Hmm?

24:25.859 --> 24:27.374
There you go, captain, one for you.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.999
First time for everything, eh?

25:07.232 --> 25:08.577
Danny was murdered.

25:09.345 --> 25:10.366
I don't trust them.

25:11.664 --> 25:12.842
All those people.

25:18.828 --> 25:20.828
I need some time to
decide how to handle it.

25:24.685 --> 25:25.874
Do you think I'm right?

25:27.647 --> 25:29.170
Either that, or we're both nuts.

27:21.383 --> 27:22.647
I thought you weren't coming.

27:30.602 --> 27:32.210
So does this mean you believe me?

27:33.573 --> 27:35.428
Or are you convinced I'm a psycho, too?

27:36.597 --> 27:37.597
Are you?

27:40.969 --> 27:42.401
They were going to arrest me again.

27:42.896 --> 27:45.401
I ran. Watson set me up.

27:46.489 --> 27:47.612
I took it all to him.

27:47.770 --> 27:49.659
All the evidence, and
he used it to set me up.

27:49.913 --> 27:51.113
And then he tried to kill you.

27:53.493 --> 27:54.493
It's the truth.

27:57.475 --> 27:58.540
Well?

28:02.539 --> 28:03.868
He's lying.

28:05.362 --> 28:06.548
I'm not!

28:09.595 --> 28:11.790
I could go to where he used to work.

28:12.352 --> 28:13.438
See if that happened there.

28:14.762 --> 28:18.376
I need you to check his office,
see if you can find anything there.

28:31.713 --> 28:32.713
All right.

30:32.324 --> 30:34.644
HE GRUNTS

30:39.204 --> 30:40.684
Hello, Jamie.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.415
Please don't be alarmed, but
I've already called security.

30:47.381 --> 30:50.007
I don't know what you're doing in
my office, but I'd like you to stop.

30:50.031 --> 30:51.076
She didn't do it.

30:51.902 --> 30:53.742
- Zoe.
- You may be right.

30:55.222 --> 30:56.481
Why don't we discuss it in the morning?

30:56.505 --> 30:57.581
I think you killed Danny.

31:00.139 --> 31:01.139
I know you do.

31:02.333 --> 31:05.453
But that's because you've always
been a very unhappy young man.

31:07.704 --> 31:09.897
Still kicking myself that
I didn't spot it sooner.

31:11.899 --> 31:14.592
But, now, with the correct
anti-psychotic treatment,

31:14.617 --> 31:15.928
we can help you.

31:16.160 --> 31:17.160
I don't want your help.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.902
Listen to yourself.

31:20.691 --> 31:24.339
You're paranoid, Jamie, you're
imagining things that aren't there.

31:24.727 --> 31:26.519
You're allowing yourself
to be manipulated

31:26.544 --> 31:30.332
by a disturbed woman, one, I
fear, as equally vulnerable.

31:30.357 --> 31:34.045
No. You killed Danny
and you tried to kill me.

31:34.592 --> 31:35.592
Oh, come on.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.240
Doctors like me kill
people all the time.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.295
They don't talk about it, but they do.

31:45.358 --> 31:47.341
Single stroke of the
pen is all it takes.

31:47.619 --> 31:50.170
"Make comfortable,"
I think the phrase is.

31:53.206 --> 31:55.216
If I'd wanted to kill you,
you'd already be dead.

31:58.270 --> 32:00.721
Lucky for you, I only have
your best interests at heart.

32:02.519 --> 32:03.885
- Through here.
- Right.

32:13.919 --> 32:16.706
I've been racking my brains trying
to figure out what's gone wrong.

32:17.129 --> 32:19.752
You must absolutely not blame yourself.

32:20.047 --> 32:21.047
OK?

32:22.258 --> 32:25.375
Promise me? You don't
deserve any of this.

32:25.979 --> 32:27.039
Thank you.

32:33.211 --> 32:34.650
Hi, darling.

32:36.192 --> 32:38.794
It won't be long now. You know
how things are at the moment.

32:39.532 --> 32:40.911
How's Margaret?

33:27.758 --> 33:28.758
Hi.

33:32.340 --> 33:33.583
Are you feeling better today?

33:36.581 --> 33:38.614
Do you really think Zoe did any of this?

33:40.635 --> 33:43.012
What do I think? Um...

33:45.909 --> 33:49.864
I think she's always
been an unhappy and...

33:50.718 --> 33:52.450
very disturbed young woman.

33:53.941 --> 33:57.106
Sometimes, people can hide
those things really well.

33:58.255 --> 34:02.036
And she refused to admit
any weakness, but...

34:03.640 --> 34:07.210
well, these sort of problems,
they don't just go away, do they?

34:08.795 --> 34:10.342
Not if they're inside you.

34:20.821 --> 34:22.405
Oh, I'm sick of lying here.

34:23.071 --> 34:25.190
Well, I think it's about time that

34:25.761 --> 34:27.632
we got back to business, don't you?

34:28.721 --> 34:29.721
Hm?

34:38.588 --> 34:39.628
Right.

34:41.092 --> 34:43.056
No. I want to walk.

34:44.402 --> 34:45.516
Are you sure?

34:48.534 --> 34:49.775
OK.

34:55.621 --> 34:57.502
Right. Skoosh your bum to the edge.

35:01.106 --> 35:03.517
That's it. Hands on here.

35:04.877 --> 35:05.917
Strong arms.

35:07.012 --> 35:09.126
OK, weight forward.

35:10.134 --> 35:11.251
On the count of three.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.423
Are you ready?

35:12.785 --> 35:16.556
One, two, three.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.986
There. Good boy!

35:19.299 --> 35:21.462
That's it. OK.

35:22.124 --> 35:24.936
I want you to move one
foot forward. One at a time.

35:25.024 --> 35:26.030
Come to me.

35:28.912 --> 35:30.226
One foot at a time.

35:45.254 --> 35:46.483
That's it.

35:54.338 --> 35:56.655
That's it. Well done.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.968
And again. Come on!

36:01.857 --> 36:02.866
You're doing great.

36:08.407 --> 36:09.593
You're doing great.

36:13.793 --> 36:15.061
Come on, Jamie.

36:21.598 --> 36:26.926
Hey, hey, hey, it's OK. I know, I know.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.926
I understand.

36:33.384 --> 36:35.254
You know you can talk to me, lovey.

36:36.059 --> 36:37.129
I won't judge you.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.387
I'm here to help you.
You know that, don't you?

36:43.347 --> 36:45.387
Whatever's going on in there,

36:45.760 --> 36:47.168
whatever your pain is...

36:50.245 --> 36:51.432
I'm here.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.456
I was married once, you know.

37:10.332 --> 37:13.721
His name was Mark and we
used to go running together,

37:13.911 --> 37:15.511
you know, marathons, that kind of thing.

37:16.417 --> 37:18.854
This was before the world and
his wife were all doing it.

37:20.850 --> 37:23.810
We travelled all over. New York, Berlin.

37:25.471 --> 37:27.431
Of course, he always beat me.

37:28.736 --> 37:29.943
Except this once.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.617
When I teased him about that...

37:34.617 --> 37:35.657
God, did I!

37:37.287 --> 37:38.311
And, then,

37:39.325 --> 37:40.845
a few weeks later, he...

37:41.269 --> 37:44.448
started dropping things
all over the place

37:44.570 --> 37:47.502
and I just laughed at him,
clumsy oaf that he was.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.385
That was just the start of it.

37:53.167 --> 37:56.299
Turns out he had MND.

37:57.227 --> 37:58.471
Motor Neurone Disease.

38:00.524 --> 38:01.524
I'm sorry.

38:01.971 --> 38:02.971
Yeah.

38:04.271 --> 38:06.185
It was cruel, you know.

38:07.210 --> 38:09.021
To see a man like that, a big,

38:09.524 --> 38:12.092
you know, strong, healthy man...

38:13.137 --> 38:14.709
just wasting away.

38:16.236 --> 38:21.236
That was what really hurt
him cos he was so proud.

38:23.558 --> 38:25.715
Some folk can deal
with it, I know. But...

38:26.777 --> 38:27.870
In the end he just...

38:28.764 --> 38:30.244
he wanted to die.

38:32.273 --> 38:33.473
He welcomed it.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.764
I know that.

38:41.614 --> 38:42.920
Is that how you feel?

38:46.979 --> 38:47.990
Sometimes.

38:51.132 --> 38:52.256
Well...

38:56.144 --> 38:57.800
you still have a choice.

38:59.305 --> 39:00.345
We all do.

39:05.526 --> 39:07.800
What if I don't deserve to...

39:10.508 --> 39:11.828
live, I mean?

39:15.066 --> 39:16.726
And is that how you really feel?

39:19.554 --> 39:20.859
Sometimes, yeah.

39:25.357 --> 39:26.422
I want to die.

39:27.141 --> 39:29.061
Oh, sweetheart.

39:30.247 --> 39:31.265
But why?

39:32.376 --> 39:35.054
You know, you are
getting so much stronger.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.319
I know in there was hard, but we...

39:37.546 --> 39:39.647
we're going to get there, I promise.

39:40.935 --> 39:43.952
Debbie always gets there
with her boys, you know?

39:44.298 --> 39:46.498
Even the stubborn ones.

39:49.567 --> 39:50.842
Come on, talk to me, darling.

39:52.189 --> 39:53.469
Talk to Debbie.

39:54.519 --> 39:56.827
I promise you, it will
make you feel better.

40:02.733 --> 40:03.733
I killed him.

40:07.102 --> 40:08.256
He was just a kid.

40:25.707 --> 40:26.764
Jamie!

41:33.463 --> 41:34.503
Please!

41:36.950 --> 41:38.150
Please.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.323
Shoot me.

41:42.301 --> 41:43.501
Please!

41:58.307 --> 41:59.432
He wanted me to.

42:02.665 --> 42:04.923
I understand. I do.

42:06.662 --> 42:07.931
You just wanted to help him.

42:08.866 --> 42:11.673
You just wanted to put the
wee soul out of his misery.

42:13.533 --> 42:15.580
I shouldn't have done it. It was wrong.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.318
That's what I have to live with.

42:22.660 --> 42:24.033
And I'm not sure I can.

42:24.803 --> 42:27.001
Oh, darling.

42:27.840 --> 42:32.039
Oh, it's OK. Everything's
going to be OK.

42:32.064 --> 42:33.984
I knew there was something.

42:35.030 --> 42:38.865
Hey. I know what you need. I can
make this right. Make it all go away.

43:10.692 --> 43:11.831
Thanks.

43:19.568 --> 43:21.666
Hiya. I'm the new locum doctor.

43:21.897 --> 43:24.618
I'm looking for the consultant offices.
I need to get my form signed.

43:24.812 --> 43:27.131
Oh, right. Just down there,
love, second on the right.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.272
Great. Thank you.

44:30.115 --> 44:31.115
OK.

44:33.401 --> 44:35.693
Hi, there. Did you find it OK?

44:37.119 --> 44:38.700
Yeah. Thanks.

44:39.371 --> 44:41.723
So, how long are you here
for? A week? A month?

44:41.765 --> 44:43.205
God knows we could do with the help!

44:43.576 --> 44:44.584
That's what they all say.

44:44.927 --> 44:47.132
No, I'm getting married.
I need the cash.

44:47.303 --> 44:49.161
Oh, expensive business these days.

44:49.466 --> 44:51.669
- So, have you got a permanent post?
- Not yet.

44:52.115 --> 44:54.324
I'm thinking about a job at
the North Glasgow Infirmary.

44:54.460 --> 44:55.504
The James Stewart?

44:56.403 --> 44:58.379
Dr Watson, didn't he used to work here?

44:58.705 --> 45:00.981
Archie? Oh, God, yes.

45:01.604 --> 45:02.746
Good old Archie.

45:03.258 --> 45:06.410
Anything I should know before
I sign on the dotted line?

45:07.012 --> 45:08.989
Always a bit of a ladies'
man, our Archie.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.480
He'll brush past you in the
lift, that sort of thing.

45:11.669 --> 45:13.468
Most of us get wise to him pretty quick.

45:13.579 --> 45:14.731
Word gets around.

45:15.409 --> 45:18.129
Top buttons and M&S
knickers girls, you know?

45:20.246 --> 45:21.254
And his patients?

45:21.279 --> 45:23.317
He was a good doctor?
You didn't notice anything?

45:23.780 --> 45:26.939
No, they loved him. Believed the
Sun shone out of his skinny backside.

45:27.338 --> 45:28.380
So, why'd he leave?

45:28.911 --> 45:30.302
I mean, this is a good unit.

45:30.991 --> 45:33.193
New challenges, apparently.

45:33.597 --> 45:34.840
But we all knew that his wife had

45:34.864 --> 45:36.464
caught him at it with a member of staff.

45:37.065 --> 45:38.386
Gave him an ultimatum.

45:39.107 --> 45:40.894
And he always was a
gutless, little weasel.

45:42.112 --> 45:44.901
Do you remember her name, the mistress?

45:44.999 --> 45:46.519
Er, what was she called?

45:46.947 --> 45:48.261
I remember she was a physio.

45:49.224 --> 45:50.620
Debbie. Debbie something.

45:55.266 --> 45:57.713
You did the right thing. I
would have done the same.

45:58.745 --> 46:00.547
Sometimes I feel as if
I'm the only one here

46:00.572 --> 46:02.805
who really cares about the patients.

46:03.372 --> 46:06.898
The doctors say they do, but
truth is they let people down.

46:06.985 --> 46:09.906
I mean, I ask you! I mean,
would you let an animal suffer

46:09.931 --> 46:12.601
like some of the poor souls
in here? No, you wouldn't.

46:16.935 --> 46:18.060
The Glasgow Infirmary.

46:18.061 --> 46:19.552
- James Stewart unit.
- No problem.

46:21.561 --> 46:25.655
Sometimes... you just have
to do what's for the best.

46:27.209 --> 46:29.304
And that's what you
did for that poor soul.

46:30.652 --> 46:32.343
He asked for your help and you gave it.

46:33.265 --> 46:34.319
That's all.

46:37.306 --> 46:38.952
You see, that's what we have in common.

46:39.138 --> 46:42.132
When someone needs us,
we are there to help.

46:43.929 --> 46:44.929
Here.

46:47.338 --> 46:48.593
It's called empathy.

46:52.173 --> 46:56.077
You understand what
a person really needs

46:56.827 --> 46:59.233
and make it happen for them.
It's all part of the job.

46:59.958 --> 47:02.663
You take those poor, wee
souls under your wing.

47:03.339 --> 47:04.702
Angel of death.

47:07.496 --> 47:08.655
You killed him.

47:09.549 --> 47:10.561
You killed Danny.

47:13.679 --> 47:15.374
Danny needed my help.

47:16.580 --> 47:18.780
All my boys need my help.

47:37.966 --> 47:39.509
Debbie. Debbie!

48:52.595 --> 48:54.165
- Where's Jamie?
- He's in hydro.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.860
You know you can't be here.

49:18.108 --> 49:19.108
Hey!

49:19.425 --> 49:20.803
- Deb!
- Hey!

49:53.686 --> 49:54.834
Help her.

50:01.951 --> 50:03.155
Debbie, are you all right?

50:05.433 --> 50:08.042
That's it. Easy now.

50:29.018 --> 50:30.480
They all needed my help.

50:32.490 --> 50:36.401
Well, apart from nosey,
wee Danny, but he was...

50:39.284 --> 50:40.987
He wasn't right. Was he?

50:42.944 --> 50:45.808
It was more important to
me that I continued my work.

50:46.948 --> 50:49.469
No-one else in that place was
going to make the tough decisions.

50:52.519 --> 50:53.597
You see,

50:54.476 --> 50:55.819
after my husband died,

50:57.284 --> 50:58.565
a lot of things just...

50:59.771 --> 51:02.851
sort of made sense to me.

51:04.390 --> 51:08.458
And that death doesn't
have to be a bad thing.

51:10.534 --> 51:11.894
We all have our time.

51:13.872 --> 51:17.476
It's just sometimes God gets
that time a wee bit wrong.

51:19.995 --> 51:21.093
Lets people suffer.

51:22.139 --> 51:23.139
Needlessly.

51:26.005 --> 51:27.165
So...

51:29.000 --> 51:30.256
there has to be a correction.

51:31.447 --> 51:32.476
You know?

51:34.340 --> 51:35.740
Someone to just...

51:37.515 --> 51:40.595
snip the loose ends, as it were.

51:44.530 --> 51:45.690
And that was me.

51:48.612 --> 51:49.929
I mean, don't get me wrong.

51:50.758 --> 51:52.390
It wasn't easy.

51:55.531 --> 51:57.741
But my patients needed my help.

51:58.437 --> 51:59.772
They were lonely,

52:00.098 --> 52:01.444
they had been abandoned,

52:02.051 --> 52:06.331
and I was the only person that
was there to look after them.

52:07.898 --> 52:09.874
So, believe me when I say that...

52:11.755 --> 52:13.155
it wasn't easy.

52:17.592 --> 52:20.364
But Debbie always got there in the end.

53:12.019 --> 53:13.262
You don't have to do this.

53:24.580 --> 53:26.140
You were sleeping with her.

53:28.720 --> 53:29.960
We had...

53:31.692 --> 53:32.972
an understanding.

53:38.041 --> 53:40.454
You ignored legitimate concerns
when they were brought to

53:40.479 --> 53:43.398
your attention, choosing
instead to victimise

53:43.423 --> 53:46.227
a junior colleague. Dr Karimi
questioned you about the

53:46.252 --> 53:48.673
use of the Mental Health Act,
which you also ignored...

53:49.310 --> 53:51.060
Obviously, you'll all have
heard that Dr Watson

53:51.084 --> 53:53.563
is on indefinite leave,
pending investigation.

53:53.875 --> 53:57.263
I'd like to start by encouraging
anyone with further evidence

53:57.288 --> 53:59.974
of inappropriate behaviour
to come forward and speak out.

54:00.043 --> 54:01.808
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

54:02.384 --> 54:03.402
Good.

54:03.818 --> 54:05.769
I know many of you have
already taken advantage

54:05.794 --> 54:07.873
of the counselling that we've provided.

54:08.261 --> 54:10.644
I'm hoping that we can
put the past behind us

54:11.271 --> 54:12.982
and all make a fresh start.

54:14.981 --> 54:15.981
OK.

54:17.074 --> 54:19.879
So, shall we do it to them
before they do it to us?

54:22.061 --> 54:23.061
First patient.

54:45.729 --> 54:46.783
We could just do it.

54:47.619 --> 54:48.619
Go anywhere.

54:55.429 --> 54:56.510
Well?

55:11.896 --> 55:12.947
They're ready for you.

55:19.657 --> 55:20.657
You sure?

55:23.130 --> 55:24.130
I did it.

55:25.812 --> 55:27.106
I need to tell them the truth.

55:31.710 --> 55:32.746
I'll be here.
