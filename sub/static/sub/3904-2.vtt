WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:11.214
Yeah, so we out on Carrollton,

00:11.215 --> 00:13.814

and his wife roll up,

00:13.815 --> 00:16.814
he's like, "young man, you know
where the Poe House is?"

00:16.815 --> 00:19.215
I'm like,
"Unc, you kiddin' me?

00:19.216 --> 00:21.215
Look around, take your pick. "

00:25.196 --> 00:26.294
So, the old man,

00:26.295 --> 00:27.794
he's like, "the Poe House.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.695
The Edward Allen Poe House... "

00:29.995 --> 00:31.675
shit, you back already?

00:32.445 --> 00:34.065
First of the month, yo...

00:34.306 --> 00:36.775
I'm like, "I don't know no
Edward Allen Poe. "

00:36.926 --> 00:39.956
The man look at me all sad
and shit like I let him down...

00:42.614 --> 00:44.734
I know you know
you ain't comin' in here.

00:44.864 --> 00:45.604
What?

00:45.644 --> 00:47.184
Shorty, I don't know you.

00:47.365 --> 00:50.033
You know Miss Elaine
in the back room, right?

00:50.034 --> 00:52.134
This her brother,
Earl from the V.A. Hospital.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.934
He supposed to stay with her.

00:54.656 --> 00:56.324
Can you help me inside?

00:56.325 --> 00:57.724
I'm Chantal.

So, what's good?

01:24.974 --> 01:26.643
Thank you, young man.

01:30.713 --> 01:32.213
Oh shit.

01:32.613 --> 01:34.273
Oh shit.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.734
Nah, nah, nah...

01:47.173 --> 01:48.452
Hey, yo, Omar.

01:48.643 --> 01:50.221
Yo, all due respect,

01:50.222 --> 01:51.822
but this right here,

01:51.992 --> 01:54.112
this a Barksdale joint, man.

01:56.112 --> 01:57.212
Do tell.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.345
All Due Respect

03:34.589 --> 03:36.988
You think this boy
woke up yesterday morning,

03:36.989 --> 03:38.589
sat on the edge of his bed

03:38.591 --> 03:40.690
and said:
"Today's my day to die?"

03:41.920 --> 03:43.969
You don't think
this can happen to you?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.460
Doc, hold that up.

03:51.978 --> 03:53.979
Look at what that bullet
did to his heart.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.299
That's his heart.

03:59.169 --> 04:01.037
What was that,
scared straight?

04:01.038 --> 04:03.039
More like bored stiff.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.067
What's the deal with this?

04:05.068 --> 04:08.367
I go down to M.C.I. Jessup hoping
to pull up a fella with some years on him,

04:08.368 --> 04:10.147
see if he's ready
to share his feelings.

04:10.148 --> 04:13.848
Turns out Barksdale D'Angelo
got himself rung up as a suicide.

04:13.849 --> 04:16.348
D.O.D. of 72103.

04:16.428 --> 04:17.757
Who worked it?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.058
State police.

04:19.588 --> 04:21.397
You want me to pull
the postmortem on this?

04:21.397 --> 04:23.304
Yeah, he's kind of
our made guy down there.

04:23.315 --> 04:25.898
I just want to make sure
that nobody did the suicide to him.

04:26.938 --> 04:29.838
Ain't nuthin' but dust
an' bricks over there now.

04:29.918 --> 04:33.337
Shit, all that battlin'
we did to take them towers.

04:33.577 --> 04:36.551
You're tryin' to tell me we back
on the street with the rest of 'em.

04:36.578 --> 04:40.656
Anyway, b, now that the towers is gone
everybody knows how it gotta go down.

04:40.657 --> 04:43.043
I say we send our people
over there early.

04:43.057 --> 04:45.258
Corner chiefs like:
"Yo, we here now,

04:45.768 --> 04:48.466
"you know what I mean,
but we bringing something to the table. "

04:48.478 --> 04:50.196
Lay it out like
it's their lucky day.

04:50.197 --> 04:53.496
No flexin', no threats.
Just be like, this a good thing.

04:54.257 --> 04:56.596
But you know
we gonna need good corners,

04:56.597 --> 04:58.981
that's what we're gonna need.
Close to downtown.

04:58.996 --> 05:00.696
Get the workaday trade.

05:00.847 --> 05:03.196
- Come out like Freemont
- Fayette.

05:03.197 --> 05:07.288
Yeah, like 40,
$50,000 a day, easy.

05:07.296 --> 05:08.289
Yeah, I'm on it.

05:08.297 --> 05:10.795
You know everyone
watchin' us on this, man.

05:10.796 --> 05:13.802
They wanna see if we're gonna fuck this up
now that the towers are down.

05:13.846 --> 05:15.797
You know what I'm sin'?
They measurin' us up.

05:15.947 --> 05:18.296
They wanna see
if we're gonna be weak or real.

05:18.436 --> 05:21.075
If a fool step to us, man,
we gonna do what we gotta do.

05:21.076 --> 05:23.476
But it's them bodies
that got you in here.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.226
If we can do this without the bodies,
we should.

05:26.536 --> 05:27.734
You know what I mean?

05:27.735 --> 05:29.535
Especially now
we light on muscle.

05:29.536 --> 05:32.191
Speakin' of muscle, man,
you heard from that man I sent you?

05:32.215 --> 05:34.834
Yeah, Cutty from the cut.
He rang, we took care of him.

05:34.836 --> 05:36.136
Good, good.

05:36.976 --> 05:38.375
How you fixed for the hearing?

05:38.376 --> 05:40.175
It's all good, man.

05:40.176 --> 05:41.376
Shit.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.554
Levy got everything
straightened up tight for me, man.

05:44.555 --> 05:46.355
I'll be home
before it get cold.

05:49.045 --> 05:50.555
Towers came down.

05:51.215 --> 05:52.116
So?

05:52.746 --> 05:54.015
So, we're comin' in.

05:54.385 --> 05:55.674
To my corners?

05:55.754 --> 05:57.025
I don't think so.

05:57.026 --> 05:59.923
Hold on now.
This is gonna be good for you too...

05:59.924 --> 06:00.824
Yeah?

06:01.164 --> 06:02.631
Now, how you figure that?

06:02.645 --> 06:06.245
Yo, what you payin' now, 37, 38?

06:07.524 --> 06:09.569
Yo, we can go 31, 32 shots.

06:09.595 --> 06:11.594
Man, this shit's so John Blaze

06:11.594 --> 06:15.594
you can step on it seven, eight times
and still take the cake...

06:16.154 --> 06:17.273
Spider bags!

06:17.794 --> 06:19.094
Spider bags!

06:23.284 --> 06:23.847
Damn!

06:25.495 --> 06:27.194
Yo, y'all seen Marlo?

06:31.353 --> 06:32.833
Y'all ain't seen him?

06:33.923 --> 06:35.144
Y'all know him?

06:36.064 --> 06:37.193
Marlo?

06:37.994 --> 06:39.974
Yeah, yeah, he was here.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.663
Now he ain't.

06:43.873 --> 06:46.884
<i>Get those spider bags,
spider bags!</i>

06:49.683 --> 06:53.152
Jesus, Tommy, I like to shit

06:53.153 --> 06:57.852
when I looked up and saw you
on the news, givin' it to Erv.

06:59.723 --> 07:02.237
you fucker,
you're up to something.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.253
I'm up to nothing,
I'm telling you.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.492
I can help him,
he can help me.

07:06.862 --> 07:09.752
A little itch here,
a little scratch there.

07:10.673 --> 07:13.172
This is a win-win
for you, ain't it?

07:13.512 --> 07:17.452
He won't play? You beat the shit
outta him because crime is up.

07:18.283 --> 07:20.422
Press loves it and you score.

07:21.032 --> 07:23.432
Flip-side is that if he caves,

07:23.433 --> 07:26.832
you get yourself a snitch
in the Mayor's inner-circle.

07:29.772 --> 07:31.261
So um...

07:31.741 --> 07:33.829
what's my role
in your little drama?

07:33.842 --> 07:35.842
I thought you might
broker a meeting.

07:36.252 --> 07:37.052
You know,

07:38.372 --> 07:41.666
help your fearless leader see the light
about his new friend on the council.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.151
And I should tell him, what?

07:44.152 --> 07:47.626
Make nice or invest heavily
in petroleum jelly?

07:47.651 --> 07:50.551
Hey, his ass, his choice.

07:55.681 --> 07:57.251
You didn't talk to him?

07:57.901 --> 07:59.881
I couldn't find
the motherfucker.

08:00.978 --> 08:02.974
Man, we just walk up,
we gonna bump.

08:08.633 --> 08:11.496
There.
Middle of the block, right there.

08:57.216 --> 08:58.440
Yo, where the whistle at?

09:07.196 --> 09:08.103
Hold on.

09:10.621 --> 09:11.325
Wait for Marlo.

09:26.439 --> 09:29.000
<i>Yo, Cheese.
Where you been at, man?</i>

09:36.957 --> 09:38.850
Nigger, that ain't
nothin' but bait.

09:39.132 --> 09:40.430
Just soap your bitch.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.252
Who my dawg?
You my dawg.

09:47.901 --> 09:49.840
Who's my Dawg?
Who's my baby?

09:50.293 --> 09:52.405
You make daddy some money, alright?
Yeah.

10:01.466 --> 10:03.486
25 large on Dawg.

10:05.770 --> 10:06.363
<i>Cheese!</i>

10:08.337 --> 10:09.072
Yeah.

10:26.278 --> 10:27.154
<i>Anybody I want?</i>

10:28.688 --> 10:29.312
Anybody.

10:31.315 --> 10:32.598
I want more than one.

10:33.301 --> 10:34.397
I want the Olsen twins.

10:35.008 --> 10:35.648
You got 'em.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.214
Slaves.

10:37.589 --> 10:39.216
All they live for
is to get you off.

10:40.225 --> 10:41.985
But so now who
you gonna do for 'em?

10:42.635 --> 10:44.825
One guy, one act, one time.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.952
Right.
And the minute I name a guy

10:47.296 --> 10:49.587
you're gonna be like,
"I knew you were a cocksucker

10:49.588 --> 10:51.242
"from the first time
I laid eyes on you.

10:51.273 --> 10:54.058
Steve McQueen, huh?
That's your fantasy?

10:54.075 --> 10:55.987
You fuckin'
closet-case motherfucker.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.053
Steve McQueen?

10:58.381 --> 10:59.790
Fuck you, it's a set-up.

11:01.088 --> 11:02.418
Both Olsen twins.

11:03.247 --> 11:03.840
Ashley.

11:05.169 --> 11:06.562
- Kate.
- Mary-Kate.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.302
And yeah, I admire
their body of work.

11:09.863 --> 11:10.707
They're yours.

11:11.522 --> 11:12.884
All you gotta do
is name a guy.

11:16.351 --> 11:17.666
I'm not catching,
I'm pitching.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.026
No problem.

11:28.874 --> 11:30.767
Cornermen out of the pit.

11:38.399 --> 11:39.855
Release your dogs.

11:58.974 --> 12:00.946
I got that!
Yeah! I got that!

12:18.908 --> 12:20.238
Break your dogs!

12:40.907 --> 12:41.392
Bait...

13:19.126 --> 13:20.502
<i>Oh shit, there it is. </i>

13:21.675 --> 13:22.879
<i>Can it just be like... </i>

13:23.495 --> 13:26.156
<i>like this unbearable-looking woman?</i>

13:26.735 --> 13:29.053
You know like that old tune
from "The Golden Girls"

13:29.346 --> 13:31.364
the short one with
the coke-bottle glasses...

13:33.013 --> 13:33.561
A guy.

13:36.751 --> 13:38.003
<i>Hey, yo. </i>

13:38.723 --> 13:39.098
Huh?

13:39.505 --> 13:40.668
Let me ask you a question.

13:41.431 --> 13:44.705
Where do you guys get those hats
with the bills over the ears like that?

13:44.861 --> 13:47.534
I go into all the city stores
and the only ones I can find

13:47.535 --> 13:49.414
are the ones with
the bills in the front.

13:50.022 --> 13:53.036
Naw, it's the same.
Just turn it sideways on your head.

13:54.971 --> 13:56.741
Thanks. Thank you.

14:02.485 --> 14:04.785
That's a knucklehead from
the low-rises, right there.

14:04.894 --> 14:06.114
Terrace's spreading out.

14:07.241 --> 14:08.868
They got to go
somewhere, I guess.

14:14.613 --> 14:16.476
Don't think you ought
needed to do that.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.339
He turned cur on me, man...

14:20.923 --> 14:21.563
Nah.

14:22.878 --> 14:24.067
I think you got played.

14:49.809 --> 14:54.016
So, I'm guessin' from the Terrace
being all cute about the property line.

14:55.439 --> 14:58.349
<i>I just wanted to wait and see
what you wanted us to do about it. </i>

14:59.860 --> 15:02.598
So, what you want us to do?

15:03.943 --> 15:04.945
Get back to work.

15:06.338 --> 15:06.900
Alright.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.027
<i>Your boy really jammed me,
that little prick. </i>

15:26.652 --> 15:28.527
<i>It was all over the news. </i>

15:28.878 --> 15:32.007
You did not look particularly
commissioner-like.

15:32.039 --> 15:33.713
Mayor told me the same thing.

15:36.138 --> 15:37.673
You can't have that shit
every week,

15:38.756 --> 15:41.430
not if you want His Honor
to give you the job permanent.

15:42.870 --> 15:44.747
Tommy's a good kid, usually.

15:45.327 --> 15:47.047
An asspain when
he wants something,

15:47.626 --> 15:48.892
but mostly good people.

15:49.087 --> 15:51.058
I don't give a shit
what he is.

15:51.074 --> 15:53.313
Well, you can't have him
pounding on you, Erv.

15:54.424 --> 15:55.925
Throw him a bone,

15:58.052 --> 15:59.084
he'll take care of you.

16:01.307 --> 16:01.902
Alright,

16:03.189 --> 16:06.879
but I draw the line at going behind
the Mayor for this guy.

16:07.928 --> 16:12.279
You can't sit where I'm sitting
and backdoor the fucking Mayor.

16:12.357 --> 16:13.473
Sorry I'm late, guys.

16:14.739 --> 16:17.211
My kid had a little league game.
It started late.

16:17.445 --> 16:19.089
Well, I'll leave
you boys to it.

16:21.137 --> 16:25.206
And what I have brought together,
let no man tear asunder.

16:28.586 --> 16:29.744
- He win?
- Who?

16:30.150 --> 16:31.621
Your kid, his team.

16:32.434 --> 16:33.763
Oh shit, who keeps score?

16:37.165 --> 16:38.759
Yeah, it's a little hectic,

16:38.760 --> 16:41.077
but everybody steppin' off
at the right time.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.236
These corner boys
we dealin' with?

16:43.581 --> 16:45.911
I don't think they even
listen to their own people.

16:46.193 --> 16:47.625
Yeah, I'm gonna
talk to peoples.

16:48.970 --> 16:51.114
- Where you at?
- Marlo?

16:51.865 --> 16:53.210
I can't find 'im.

16:53.976 --> 16:57.495
And you told us not to start nothin',
so I set-up in the middle of the block.

16:58.354 --> 17:01.329
You know, even that got hard stares.
I don't know.

17:02.204 --> 17:03.776
It ain't gonna hold, I don't think.

17:03.910 --> 17:04.847
This Marlo.

17:05.801 --> 17:07.211
How hard you lookin' for him?

17:09.756 --> 17:12.946
Like, why ain't you out there
looking for this motherfucker right now?

17:12.963 --> 17:14.606
'Cause you called
this meeting here.

17:22.619 --> 17:23.528
Shut the door.

17:27.657 --> 17:28.753
What's your good news, man.

17:29.183 --> 17:30.874
Omar right inside the stash.

17:31.092 --> 17:34.995
Couple ounces of raw
already vialed, 600.

17:35.683 --> 17:37.403
Cocksuckers even took
my watch.

17:37.888 --> 17:40.470
Second stash this month
they did got to.

17:40.814 --> 17:44.255
I mean, he, um,
he called you by name, String.

17:45.115 --> 17:48.510
I mean, all due respect, but
do like unless you step to him.

17:48.823 --> 17:49.855
It's gonna be like this.

17:55.184 --> 17:57.703
Alright, man.
Double the muscle on every stash we got.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.362
And if the man comin',

18:01.160 --> 18:02.365
make ready for the man.

18:02.943 --> 18:04.196
It's not personal.

18:04.744 --> 18:07.467
I swear to God,
it's never personal with me.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.662
Truth is,

18:13.552 --> 18:15.884
I've been a councilman
for almost three years now.

18:16.009 --> 18:18.221
And that's a long
fucking time to be ignored.

18:19.552 --> 18:20.647
And this being Baltimore,

18:20.663 --> 18:22.962
a whiteboy doesn't stand
much chance running citywide.

18:22.994 --> 18:25.262
Maybe the legislature,
if the right seat opens up.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.764
But until then, I'm stuck
in a job with no power

18:27.859 --> 18:29.730
except getting
potholes filled.

18:31.514 --> 18:33.562
All due respect, Councilman,

18:33.563 --> 18:37.021
you're fucking with me because,
what, you're bored?

18:37.412 --> 18:38.304
A little, yeah.

18:39.961 --> 18:40.749
And what the fuck.

18:40.765 --> 18:42.562
I mean, when it comes
to the crime thing,

18:42.563 --> 18:44.784
this city can use all
the fucking help it can get.

18:44.817 --> 18:47.163
If you're looking for dirt,
there isn't any.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.680
There's always fucking dirt.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.438
But right now, I'm just looking to know
how we could do better.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.239
You give me that much.

18:54.786 --> 18:57.039
I can try and get you
what you need privately.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.292
No hearings, no press,
no grandstanding.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.659
And if I don't play ball?

19:01.301 --> 19:02.412
You're gonna have my ass

19:02.427 --> 19:04.758
every time I'm in front
of your committee, right?

19:09.812 --> 19:11.273
One thing comes to mind.

19:11.710 --> 19:12.195
Shoot.

19:12.805 --> 19:16.842
I can't get my marked units
back from Dickman Street to save my life.

19:17.688 --> 19:20.456
Cars that are shopped for service
don't come back for weeks.

19:21.063 --> 19:21.971
You tell the Mayor?

19:24.505 --> 19:26.337
Not that you heard it from me.

19:26.649 --> 19:27.495
Of course not.

19:30.895 --> 19:32.787
- How much these?
- 10,000 a set.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.450
Nigger show that on a ride,
he hangin' a sign on himself.

19:38.888 --> 19:39.874
Lock my ass up.

19:40.983 --> 19:41.687
No, shit.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.324
So how you gonna play it?

19:45.566 --> 19:48.274
If they from the Terrace,
that's Avon.

19:49.368 --> 19:49.868
I know.

19:50.370 --> 19:51.731
And Avon, he comin' home, too.

19:54.391 --> 19:57.582
Well, if you inclined to work
something out, that's one thing.

19:58.476 --> 19:59.116
If not?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.446
Avon can seriously handle up.

20:02.808 --> 20:03.392
I know.

20:03.706 --> 20:07.023
So if you want to hold onto what's yours,
you best be ready.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.893
You remember
that Barksdale kid?

20:12.940 --> 20:14.616
The one who took
all the weight?

20:16.040 --> 20:19.481
Tied his neck to a doorknob
in the prison library and sat his ass down.

20:20.543 --> 20:21.280
I dunno.

20:22.962 --> 20:24.917
Men of color usually don't do themselves.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.296
I mean, take me,
for instance...

20:29.437 --> 20:31.723
Yeah, I mean.
You got all the reason in the world...

20:31.738 --> 20:35.133
And yet here I am,
still standing.

20:35.587 --> 20:36.243
Give or take.

20:40.969 --> 20:42.799
You looked at
the scene photos?

20:43.386 --> 20:44.384
Nah, there ain't none.

20:45.389 --> 20:46.562
State police dogged it.

20:53.896 --> 20:55.023
My turn, Bunk.

20:57.073 --> 20:59.826
Come on, come on.
Go with number three.

21:08.646 --> 21:10.132
You gonna play
my song, darling?

21:10.758 --> 21:11.118
Huh?

21:13.075 --> 21:14.874
- You play the right song...
- Hey, Bunk.

21:14.904 --> 21:16.580
I can make you hit
the high notes, baby.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.033
Hey, Bunk.

21:17.065 --> 21:18.708
Hey, look,
I saw her first, Jimmy...

21:18.738 --> 21:20.023
Bunk, man,
what are you doing?

21:20.054 --> 21:21.649
I got a place
right here in Canmden.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.775
Be a gentleman, come on.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.043
I'm bein' a gentleman, man.

21:24.434 --> 21:26.091
I'm really
not interested, okay?

21:26.124 --> 21:27.420
Come on, let's go.

21:27.467 --> 21:28.767
You're all pink, baby.

21:30.097 --> 21:32.834
I'm really sorry, he's had a bit
too much to drink, you know?

21:32.866 --> 21:34.914
It's okay, thank you, thanks.

21:36.658 --> 21:38.456
- You alright?
- Yeah.

21:39.192 --> 21:40.583
You get yourself home?

21:41.459 --> 21:41.897
Yeah.

21:43.697 --> 21:44.386
Knock it out.

21:50.119 --> 21:52.046
Naw, the baddest nigger
of all time?

21:52.092 --> 21:52.483
Who?

21:52.530 --> 21:54.830
This nigger from New York
from the olden days,

21:54.861 --> 21:56.352
- Bumpy something...
- Bumpy?

21:56.399 --> 22:00.153
Yo, he do shit like, run up
to a police station by himsself.

22:00.527 --> 22:00.921
Nah.

22:01.062 --> 22:04.096
You know what I'm sayin'?
Shit like that. Cops be like hidin', like,

22:04.112 --> 22:08.404
"Yo, Bumpy, we sorry, man, we sorry.
Please go away, please, please!"

22:09.514 --> 22:10.203
Woof.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.191
And obtain gainful employment

22:24.192 --> 22:26.431
and refrain from associating
with known criminals,

22:26.447 --> 22:28.605
and keep this office
informed of your residence

22:28.621 --> 22:30.060
and any change in that residence.

22:30.170 --> 22:32.609
So I gather you're not working
at this particular time.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.499
They still doin' the morning
shape-ups down at the market?

22:35.920 --> 22:39.251
I don't know and I don't care.
Just get a job, any job.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.758
- "Woof"?
- "Woof", like a dog.

22:44.149 --> 22:45.803
Oh shit, it was like blaow!

22:46.257 --> 22:47.634
It was Cheese's boy, Tri.

22:53.236 --> 22:54.799
So you gonna
hit back or what?

22:58.189 --> 22:59.909
You got a better shot
of the ligature?

23:00.034 --> 23:00.879
Yeah, inside.

23:08.395 --> 23:09.864
What he do,
hang himself twice?

23:10.178 --> 23:13.605
He could have been leaning straight forward
until he blacked out then slid down

23:13.636 --> 23:15.174
which would give you the vertical.

23:15.206 --> 23:17.594
Or how about I come up
at him from behind...

23:18.975 --> 23:21.555
and then set him down, make it
look like goodbye cruel world.

23:22.072 --> 23:23.543
What do the scene shots show?

23:24.091 --> 23:24.983
None taken.

23:25.573 --> 23:27.723
The troopers really fucked
the pooch on this one.

23:27.746 --> 23:29.466
All I have is some
half-assed report

23:29.952 --> 23:32.112
reads like the investigator
went off his ritalin.

23:33.003 --> 23:34.306
What's a large eckee...

23:34.338 --> 23:37.091
No, large ecchymotic area,
or mid-back.

23:38.045 --> 23:38.655
Bruising.

23:40.282 --> 23:41.926
What, mid-back... as in...?

23:43.817 --> 23:46.164
Or he banged himself a few
days earlier in the shower.

23:46.180 --> 23:46.758
Yeah, maybe.

23:47.650 --> 23:48.996
Nothing like a definite maybe.

23:49.809 --> 23:51.732
<i>Tri finally got that m?</i>

23:51.936 --> 23:53.422
<i>Done it on foot too. </i>

23:54.130 --> 23:54.943
Caroline?

23:55.946 --> 24:00.576
<i>Nigger lyin' in chalk but my boy Tri
got the dapple all up his sleeve. </i>

24:00.650 --> 24:02.136
<i>Looks like polka dots. </i>

24:02.167 --> 24:04.782
<i>But that's just something
you got to know from experience,</i>

24:04.813 --> 24:06.173
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

24:06.204 --> 24:09.552
<i>I even had to school him on the whistle,
still walkin' around with it. </i>

24:10.130 --> 24:14.053
<i>"Yo Tri, stash that shit up at Neesey'S.
What's wrong with you?"</i>

24:14.837 --> 24:17.641
<i>Aw, you know them niggers
is gonna get mad busy over this</i>

24:17.642 --> 24:19.239
<i>so we gettin' busy too. </i>

24:19.270 --> 24:21.257
<i>So what time
you comin' over?</i>

24:21.774 --> 24:24.730
<i>Damn, bitch,
ain't you even listenin'?</i>

24:27.062 --> 24:27.971
<i>You still there?</i>

24:37.188 --> 24:37.706
Time-out!

24:47.389 --> 24:48.188
Do that again.

24:48.564 --> 24:50.612
- Do what again?
- Do that thing with your hand.

24:50.644 --> 24:51.426
Do it in my face.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.506
Fuck you talkin' about?

24:58.211 --> 24:59.728
Got a lot of room in here.

25:11.419 --> 25:12.515
Fuck the police!

25:13.000 --> 25:15.440
Naw, man,
we was just hangin'.

25:15.971 --> 25:16.911
Just slingin'.

25:18.194 --> 25:20.122
How'd you work it out
with the corner crews,

25:20.153 --> 25:22.281
all you guys from the Terrace
coming in like this?

25:22.313 --> 25:23.877
I don't know
what you talkin' about.

25:23.893 --> 25:26.491
Well, you best watch your ass.
'Cause the slingers out here?

25:26.585 --> 25:28.227
They're like the
crack babies' babies.

25:28.289 --> 25:30.582
Man, every year
everybody's like:

25:30.583 --> 25:33.211
"Yeah, these kids out here,
they're a new breed. "

25:33.493 --> 25:35.557
"I ain't never seen
nothing like this before. "

25:35.558 --> 25:36.942
"This the end
of the world now. "

25:36.973 --> 25:37.932
Look around, fuckhead.

25:37.948 --> 25:40.029
This seem like the dawn
of a new day to you?

25:41.250 --> 25:42.252
Can I go now?

25:42.878 --> 25:44.708
Or you want to slap me up
some more first.

25:50.754 --> 25:52.005
Get the fuck out of here.

25:59.953 --> 26:00.939
How about a handjob?

26:01.829 --> 26:02.158
Huh?

26:04.333 --> 26:06.890
Aw, man, you don't even get
Weezy Jefferson for a handjob.

26:06.906 --> 26:07.375
Come on.

26:08.475 --> 26:09.116
Dozerman.

26:09.148 --> 26:10.164
Wanna call it a day?

26:17.487 --> 26:19.036
<i>They came back
on us this time. </i>

26:19.247 --> 26:21.186
<i>Dazz an' them.
They got Peanut. </i>

26:21.718 --> 26:23.221
<i>Oh, shit, is Peanut dead?</i>

26:23.581 --> 26:25.034
<i>Naw, he's okay. </i>

26:25.035 --> 26:28.022
<i>His brains all over
the sidewalk but he's okay. </i>

26:28.241 --> 26:29.603
<i>What the hell
do you think?</i>

26:29.823 --> 26:32.217
<i>Ah, shit, I gotta call Tony.
I'll get back Atchya. </i>

26:32.530 --> 26:33.156
<i>Alright. </i>

26:34.602 --> 26:36.118
Well, that's two
we heard about.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.933
What the hell's going on?

26:38.074 --> 26:39.139
Drug war maybe?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.264
<i>S'up?</i>

26:41.344 --> 26:42.610
<i>Nothing good, man. </i>

26:43.346 --> 26:45.427
<i>I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. </i>

26:46.143 --> 26:50.243
<i>Close my eyes, see him layin'
there all bloody and shit. </i>

26:50.822 --> 26:53.434
<i>Cheese, man,
you did what you had to do. </i>

26:54.325 --> 26:55.863
<i>What I thought I had to do. </i>

26:56.005 --> 26:56.770
That's Cheese?

26:57.005 --> 26:58.366
<i>He was my Dawg, yo. </i>

26:58.742 --> 27:00.681
<i>Had much love for me,
even then. </i>

27:01.307 --> 27:03.937
<i>I ain't never gonna find
another Dawg like that... </i>

27:05.389 --> 27:07.046
<i>well, they payin' for it now. </i>

27:07.611 --> 27:08.565
<i>Mos' def. </i>

27:11.411 --> 27:14.353
For months, these assholes
show perfect phone discipline.

27:14.946 --> 27:16.371
Now, they're
talking up murders?

27:16.403 --> 27:18.594
Cheese is only a level
below Proposition Joe.

27:19.329 --> 27:21.004
All of a sudden,
this case has legs.

27:21.379 --> 27:22.087
<i>Homicide... </i>

27:22.365 --> 27:24.133
This is Freamon, major-case.

27:24.274 --> 27:25.463
Who's the O.I.C. tonight?

27:25.697 --> 27:26.663
<i>Hold on for Norris. </i>

27:28.411 --> 27:29.725
<i>Yo, T., T., Man. </i>

27:30.022 --> 27:30.566
<i>S'up?</i>

27:31.008 --> 27:33.371
<i>I'm shot, I'm shot. </i>

27:33.698 --> 27:36.627
<i>Aw shit, shit,
they comin' back. </i>

27:38.263 --> 27:39.060
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

27:45.177 --> 27:46.099
<i>Who this?</i>

27:46.714 --> 27:47.371
<i>Damn. </i>

27:48.654 --> 27:49.687
<i>Detective Norris. </i>

27:49.828 --> 27:51.314
Ed, this is Lester.

27:51.422 --> 27:53.584
<i>I hear you're catchin'
bodies on the east side. </i>

27:53.585 --> 27:56.087
You "hear" it?
Like what, "probable cause," hear it?

27:56.212 --> 27:58.095
Like, "I got something
concrete," hear it?

27:58.142 --> 27:59.643
Or just,
"gas up my head," hear it?

27:59.674 --> 28:02.803
<i>Like, "I got all the fucking time
in the world to jaw with you," hear it?</i>

28:02.835 --> 28:04.196
How many bodies you got, Eddie?

28:04.242 --> 28:05.353
"How many you got, Eddie?"

28:06.249 --> 28:06.764
Asshole.

28:10.729 --> 28:13.357
- You want me to go up to homicide?
- No, I got it, I got it.

28:13.403 --> 28:15.422
You're the early man
on tomorrow, so go home.

28:15.436 --> 28:16.093
See your kid.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.912
I'm telling you, this kid
Berman's a fucking wizard.

28:20.334 --> 28:21.632
I mean check it out, right?

28:21.977 --> 28:23.790
Six reported auto thefts,

28:24.338 --> 28:27.255
two of which state,
"not impossible car was borrowed"

28:27.694 --> 28:30.118
making four auto thefts,
with two unfounded.

28:30.446 --> 28:32.855
And the prizewinner?
Four armed robberies,

28:33.089 --> 28:35.926
two of which complainants state,
"too dark to I.D. weapon,

28:36.082 --> 28:38.429
not impossible
knife wasn't a com.. "

28:38.584 --> 28:40.571
- He mighta groomed 'em to death.
- Yeah...

28:40.696 --> 28:42.295
Wine into water.

28:43.170 --> 28:44.280
There he is.

28:44.891 --> 28:45.920
Abbadabba Berman.

28:46.004 --> 28:47.395
The Doctor Atkins of crime.

28:48.349 --> 28:49.586
Just doing what I'm told.

28:54.392 --> 28:55.846
God, what a beautiful film.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.426
I couldn't understand a word.

28:57.457 --> 28:59.197
Oh, honey,
you gotta read the subtitles.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.166
Oh shit.

29:02.434 --> 29:03.824
Y'all go to the movies?

29:06.484 --> 29:08.188
And you must be
the lovely Mrs. Herc.

29:09.737 --> 29:10.942
How'd you like your movie?

29:12.114 --> 29:12.803
Okay.

29:13.569 --> 29:17.049
Herc and Carver here?
They try to snatch us up everyday like...

29:17.722 --> 29:19.395
where the shit, who got the shit...

29:20.490 --> 29:21.725
but they never get nothing.

29:22.821 --> 29:24.336
So y'all go to the movies.

29:25.978 --> 29:26.447
Damn.

29:28.669 --> 29:30.656
Alright then. See ya tomorrow.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.010
Is everything okay?

29:43.794 --> 29:44.404
On two.

29:46.438 --> 29:46.988
Pick up!

29:48.834 --> 29:49.350
Pick up!

29:49.397 --> 29:51.414
- Ed, you gotta help me.
- I can't, now now.

30:23.321 --> 30:23.633
So.

30:26.164 --> 30:26.617
So?

30:29.903 --> 30:30.732
Everything good?

30:35.533 --> 30:36.858
How's that fontanette?

30:39.486 --> 30:40.347
Fontanelle.

30:45.338 --> 30:46.307
Is it closing up?

30:48.410 --> 30:49.568
Won't close for a while.

30:51.396 --> 30:51.788
Good.

30:54.683 --> 30:55.169
Good?

31:01.009 --> 31:02.417
I'm just, I'm just sayin'.

31:17.487 --> 31:22.144
Seis hombres, seis dolares.
Seis hombres...

31:39.405 --> 31:41.360
<i>I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. </i>

31:42.285 --> 31:46.431
<i>Close my eyes an' see him layin'
there all bloody and shit?</i>

31:47.791 --> 31:50.370
- Cheese.
- Cheese on a platter.

31:50.933 --> 31:52.576
He never talks like that.

31:53.951 --> 31:54.715
Now, why would...

31:54.734 --> 31:57.660
because all good things
come to those who wait.

31:58.271 --> 31:59.319
Does McNulty know?

31:59.491 --> 32:00.789
I'll raise his ass.

32:01.924 --> 32:05.147
We'll keep our ears to the wire
keep gathering String, no problem.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.089
But if bodies keep falling
in the Eastern District,

32:08.635 --> 32:10.450
we might have to give up
this wire tap.

32:14.206 --> 32:15.442
Now you comin' around?

32:16.318 --> 32:17.787
Been more than a dam year.

32:19.915 --> 32:21.261
Looks just like his dad, huh?

32:31.582 --> 32:32.316
Let me ask you.

32:33.666 --> 32:36.091
When you heard Dee was
a suicide, what'd you think?

32:40.487 --> 32:42.645
Hey, little fellow.
Come here.

32:51.016 --> 32:54.145
Here's the thing: we got a tip.
And the autopsy report it backs us up.

32:54.756 --> 32:56.164
Can you put him down please?

32:58.041 --> 32:58.452
Sure.

33:06.070 --> 33:07.823
You know,
I'm sorry about your loss.

33:08.761 --> 33:11.438
He seemed like a pretty decent
guy, all things considered.

33:15.129 --> 33:16.896
So when I found out about this,

33:17.804 --> 33:19.618
I felt like I owed him...

33:22.215 --> 33:25.922
the last thing I wanted to do was upset you
if there was no point to it, so...

33:33.921 --> 33:37.145
if there's anything I can help with
or any questions you need answered...

33:37.943 --> 33:38.709
or whatever.

33:51.091 --> 33:53.154
Major, how many people
are under your command?

33:53.361 --> 33:55.036
278, Sir.

33:55.614 --> 33:56.537
278.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.807
And how many felony arrests
they make last month?

34:01.297 --> 34:01.954
Don't bother.

34:03.221 --> 34:04.035
You made 16.

34:05.067 --> 34:06.307
16.

34:07.445 --> 34:08.007
In a month.

34:09.745 --> 34:11.985
Same time period.
How many handguns you pick up?

34:12.049 --> 34:13.552
All shifts, all sectors...

34:16.083 --> 34:18.275
once again, don't bother.
The answer is none.

34:19.652 --> 34:20.053
None.

34:21.804 --> 34:24.275
You had four bodies last
night in how many hours?

34:25.467 --> 34:27.592
Shut the fucking book,
how many hours?

34:27.687 --> 34:28.158
Seven.

34:31.123 --> 34:31.764
Try five.

34:34.893 --> 34:35.926
Tell me about this kid.

34:39.821 --> 34:41.982
- I believe his name is James...
- James Toney.

34:42.659 --> 34:44.194
When's the last time
he was arrested?

34:44.866 --> 34:45.429
With who?

34:46.493 --> 34:47.397
Where's he sling?

34:49.043 --> 34:49.904
How about this guy?

34:53.181 --> 34:54.902
Or him? Or him?

34:56.654 --> 34:57.391
You know what?

34:57.406 --> 34:59.879
You got four bodies, all within
two blocks of each other

34:59.926 --> 35:02.788
and you can't even start
to connect the fucking dots.

35:03.665 --> 35:07.186
You got eight hours to get a grip
on this mess or you're done. You hear me?

35:07.389 --> 35:07.718
Done.

35:42.771 --> 35:43.242
Marlo?

35:50.609 --> 35:52.000
You know I'm with Avon, right?

35:53.924 --> 35:54.660
Stringer Bell?

35:58.835 --> 35:59.414
Can we talk?

36:02.731 --> 36:05.313
I need you to walk back up
there and pack up your people.

36:11.595 --> 36:13.675
I'm being a gentleman
about it for the moment.

36:24.536 --> 36:27.978
You offer up what you have on this,
you start the clock running on yourselves.

36:28.119 --> 36:30.012
The wiretap has to surface in court.

36:30.294 --> 36:31.226
No way around it.

36:31.461 --> 36:32.039
She's right.

36:33.181 --> 36:34.980
We finally got something
worth listening to

36:34.995 --> 36:36.953
and you're talking
about giving up the wire?

36:36.968 --> 36:37.688
Makes no sense.

36:37.703 --> 36:38.736
There's a war going on.

36:39.659 --> 36:41.276
We might have
four more bodies tonight.

36:41.588 --> 36:43.262
This is Baltimore,
we might have six.

36:43.747 --> 36:45.670
I watched Marvin Taylor
from the Eastern

36:45.672 --> 36:48.754
get his asshole ripped today
because he has no fucking clue.

36:48.816 --> 36:49.817
I don't believe this.

36:50.631 --> 36:52.576
We got top lieutenants
talking about murders,

36:52.592 --> 36:54.970
and we can't figure out just
to shut up and take notes?

36:55.002 --> 36:58.005
We got bodies on the ground, Jimmy.
That's gotta matter for something.

36:58.036 --> 37:00.419
Look, if we're at Cheese
then we're close to Prop Joe,

37:00.434 --> 37:02.858
and if we're close to Joe,
then we're close to Stringer.

37:02.890 --> 37:03.923
That has to matter.

37:03.970 --> 37:07.290
Look, I was right there with you
when we left Stringer on the street

37:07.291 --> 37:08.951
and it grinds me, too.

37:10.030 --> 37:13.816
But the fact is, we didn't create
this unit just to lock up dope dealers.

37:13.845 --> 37:15.910
There's a narcotics unit
downtown for that.

37:16.301 --> 37:18.632
We're about violence.
Have been from the jump.

37:19.211 --> 37:20.666
Barksdale was violent.

37:20.855 --> 37:24.578
But right now, Stringer's quiet,
and over on the eastside, we got bodies.

37:25.399 --> 37:29.842
Jimmy, we got enough from the tap
to take a real good shot at Cheese.

37:29.874 --> 37:31.578
You put a murder case
or two together,

37:31.579 --> 37:34.379
you may be able to roll someone up
at Proposition Joe or Stringer.

37:34.411 --> 37:36.404
As far as bodies go,
four's a big number.

37:41.130 --> 37:41.615
Okay then.

37:42.007 --> 37:44.901
As of now, we use the phones
to work these murders.

37:56.946 --> 38:01.461
Yo quiero mucho menos
pastillas de secoya en eso.

38:01.463 --> 38:04.777
Y muy mas ancho un poco.

38:05.107 --> 38:05.623
Si?

38:06.234 --> 38:06.844
Gracias.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.520
<i>Yo, we bracin' up, son. </i>

38:17.676 --> 38:18.144
<i>Hanh?</i>

38:18.177 --> 38:20.573
<i>Gather yo'self, nigga.
We gotta bead on Dazz. </i>

38:20.574 --> 38:21.966
<i>Be at Neesey's crib
in a hour. </i>

38:22.137 --> 38:24.460
<i>Dazz be with neesey?
I thought she was your girl. </i>

38:24.890 --> 38:25.915
Neesey, huh?
Got it.

38:25.946 --> 38:27.886
<i>We just hook up there,
then goin' to battle. </i>

38:27.934 --> 38:29.608
<i>Bring your whistle,
in a hour, one. </i>

38:32.022 --> 38:32.914
Mount up.

38:36.041 --> 38:39.670
Caroline, call qrt with
that 20 and stay on the wire.

38:40.021 --> 38:41.991
- We're on channel two.
- Alright.

38:53.006 --> 38:55.088
Yo, Tri,
what size fries you want?

38:55.181 --> 38:55.556
What?

38:56.729 --> 38:57.168
Go!

38:57.543 --> 39:03.145
Police! Freeze! Hands up!

39:07.440 --> 39:08.728
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

39:08.790 --> 39:10.938
Put your hands up!
Hands on your head!

39:13.706 --> 39:16.452
Okay, Mary Tyler Moore.
Buck-naked.

39:16.681 --> 39:18.430
Open the door, here I come,

39:19.385 --> 39:21.933
drop my attache case down,
bend her over,

39:22.203 --> 39:24.296
give it to her on the ottoman,
and she's like,

39:24.323 --> 39:26.501
"Oh Rob, oh Rob... "

39:27.228 --> 39:27.767
Who's Rob?

39:29.121 --> 39:30.458
From the show. Done.

39:31.155 --> 39:33.703
Mary-Kate and Ashley...
I don't want to say.

39:33.731 --> 39:36.209
Just accept whatever pictures
are on my mind right now.

39:36.351 --> 39:37.135
Anybody else?

39:38.274 --> 39:40.393
Yeah, Dozerman's girl,
what's her name?

39:41.005 --> 39:42.272
She's baking a cake.

39:42.784 --> 39:43.511
Naked.

39:43.909 --> 39:46.869
White flour splotches all
over her fine brown skin.

39:47.381 --> 39:50.149
I come in, in a chef's hat,
nothing else on,

39:50.378 --> 39:54.835
johnson out to here and say,
"that's no way to stir a batter.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.496
Here, let me try to get... "
Hey, Doze,

39:58.820 --> 39:59.490
what's up?

39:59.875 --> 40:00.971
Done, now the guy.

40:02.849 --> 40:04.969
This is a hard one for
anybody to understand.

40:04.999 --> 40:07.419
I mean it's got
nothing to do with sex.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.479
It's about... sympathy.

40:10.879 --> 40:13.486
- It's about giving a guy a break.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

40:16.703 --> 40:17.699
Gus Triandos.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.456
Who's Gus Triandos?

40:21.698 --> 40:23.817
A catcher with the Orioles
back in the day.

40:24.202 --> 40:25.698
Me and my brother had his card,

40:26.209 --> 40:27.874
sorry lookin' motherfucker, man.

40:27.875 --> 40:29.781
I mean, he looked
like this little kid

40:29.795 --> 40:32.415
who got left at a bus station
by his parents.

40:33.686 --> 40:34.511
You know why?

40:35.990 --> 40:38.196
Because he had to catch Hoyt
Wilhelm's knuckle ball.

40:38.467 --> 40:41.557
Five fucking years,
the worst gig in baseball.

40:41.842 --> 40:44.232
It was like trying to catch
a greased pig with wings.

40:44.247 --> 40:47.647
He even told a reporter once
"Wilhelm nearly ruined me. "

40:48.801 --> 40:49.954
Gus Triandos.

40:50.666 --> 40:51.875
Big slow guy.

40:52.757 --> 40:54.589
- Good choice.
- Go ahead, say it.

40:55.428 --> 40:58.149
- I know you want to say it.
- Say what? There's nothing to say.

40:58.176 --> 41:00.398
- Nothing?
- You put a lot of thought into it.

41:00.754 --> 41:01.301
It's cool.

41:01.814 --> 41:02.198
Okay.

41:04.318 --> 41:04.903
Okay.

41:05.287 --> 41:06.990
Tonight, three things.

41:07.289 --> 41:07.958
Number one.

41:08.428 --> 41:12.028
Keep your incident numbers sequential
or it's gonna be a stone mess tomorrow.

41:12.441 --> 41:13.238
Number two.

41:13.523 --> 41:15.631
We'll be photographing
evidence at the scene.

41:16.265 --> 41:20.021
That means don't bag anything
until you get the shot off.

41:20.818 --> 41:21.772
And number three,

41:22.200 --> 41:23.680
don't embarrass yourselves...

41:26.042 --> 41:28.097
make sure your camera's
loaded with film.

41:29.465 --> 41:30.490
Okay, mount up.

41:33.196 --> 41:34.121
So Cheese,

41:34.690 --> 41:35.530
who's your Dawg?

41:37.072 --> 41:37.955
You my Dawg.

41:40.189 --> 41:42.451
I just wanna know
who's your Dawg, Dawg.

41:42.979 --> 41:44.913
What's this some psychology, huh?

41:45.840 --> 41:50.743
Yeah, okay, uh, "yo, please stop, stop.
I'll tell you everything I know. "

41:51.430 --> 41:53.010
C'mon, Cheese.

41:55.416 --> 41:56.314
Who's your Dawg?

41:59.745 --> 42:03.446
Aw, hell no.
You ain't layin' no bodies on me, man.

42:03.559 --> 42:04.530
Lawyer time.

42:05.184 --> 42:07.181
"He was my Dawg, man. "

42:08.862 --> 42:10.940
"I ain't sleep since
I capped his ass. "

42:11.360 --> 42:15.017
"Lookin' up at me
all bloody and shit?"

42:16.333 --> 42:19.208
"Had much love for me
even then. "

42:20.190 --> 42:22.256
"I ain't never
gonna find another... "

42:27.034 --> 42:29.169
Man, you all some
cold-ass motherfuckers, man.

42:31.517 --> 42:32.441
We got you on tape.

42:38.068 --> 42:39.149
So what happen, Cheese?

42:42.409 --> 42:45.130
I thought he punked me, alright?
So I did what I had to do.

42:46.415 --> 42:47.284
Which was...

42:48.635 --> 42:49.357
Lit him up.

42:53.629 --> 42:54.924
Well, he's talking anyway.

42:59.882 --> 43:01.176
Well, what's done is done.

43:02.897 --> 43:04.392
But, maybe we can
help you on this.

43:05.743 --> 43:06.100
How?

43:06.584 --> 43:07.822
You gonna bring him back?

43:08.221 --> 43:09.802
No, on the consequences.

43:10.329 --> 43:11.396
Help us help you.

43:12.350 --> 43:14.015
- What?
- Maybe we can trade up.

43:15.068 --> 43:17.574
Trade up for what, man?
For this?

43:17.787 --> 43:19.480
- The fuck...
- Proposition Joe.

43:20.875 --> 43:22.152
You give us Prop Joe and maybe

43:22.180 --> 43:24.429
we look at this whole thing
with Dawg differently.

43:24.885 --> 43:27.862
Now, why would I be talkin'
about Prop Joe behind...

43:28.445 --> 43:31.091
You know what, man?
I don't even know no Prop Joe.

43:31.926 --> 43:33.521
Okay, Dawg...

43:34.659 --> 43:36.552
which one of these is he?
Where's that body?

43:37.605 --> 43:39.143
Where I left it most likely.

43:40.096 --> 43:42.218
- Warehouse on the east side.
- And he still there?

43:42.948 --> 43:45.895
Far's I know.
'Less the SPCA come around.

43:49.335 --> 43:49.710
What?

43:51.336 --> 43:52.541
Looks like they broke him.

43:54.339 --> 43:57.265
I got to say.
You really showed me something on this.

44:01.698 --> 44:05.281
What can I possibly add to that
except I owe you one, Cedric.

44:14.014 --> 44:17.205
You ever have one of those
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too days?

44:18.457 --> 44:19.896
I believe this could be my first.

44:24.426 --> 44:25.567
Tell me something good.

44:26.788 --> 44:27.726
We're charging him.

44:28.164 --> 44:32.014
Improper disposal of an animal.
Discharging a firearm in city limits.

44:32.357 --> 44:34.551
Animal cruelty, if you
wanna run wild with it.

44:40.714 --> 44:42.576
Go ahead.
Call me a cocksucker.

44:43.530 --> 44:45.301
- You know you wanna.
- Excuse me?

44:45.740 --> 44:49.151
You know, I actually looked up
the stats on Gus Triandos.

44:49.793 --> 44:50.778
Power hitter, right?

44:53.799 --> 44:54.925
Fuck the both of you.

45:09.584 --> 45:10.585
Later, dawg.

45:11.258 --> 45:12.463
Kiss my ass.

45:15.606 --> 45:16.263
Night, Bunk.

45:20.099 --> 45:20.773
Funny day...

45:22.806 --> 45:25.513
I'm the new departmental pet
for shutting down a drug war,

45:26.859 --> 45:28.896
but I blew my wire
for a dead terrier.

45:35.014 --> 45:40.015
You remember how you said you
hoped today would be your first

45:41.000 --> 45:43.020
have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too day?

45:44.553 --> 45:45.444
What about it?

46:11.528 --> 46:12.670
Okay, gents.

46:12.701 --> 46:16.598
You see the brake lights pump twice,
you know we got a clean hand-to-hand.

46:21.445 --> 46:26.203
So I get in this morning and I'm
looking at three phone messages

46:26.249 --> 46:28.033
from Buddy Ferraro over at D.P.W.

46:28.753 --> 46:32.661
All assuring me that I'll have
20 radio cars back in service

46:33.709 --> 46:34.913
at the end of the week.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.459
Buddy and my old man go way back.

46:37.413 --> 46:39.822
Made their first communion
together at St. Leo's.

46:44.100 --> 46:44.616
So...

46:46.571 --> 46:47.650
what else do you need?

46:48.920 --> 46:50.812
You didn't go to
the Mayor with it?

46:50.858 --> 46:52.313
Did you get your cars?

46:53.407 --> 46:54.893
Did anyone get fucked over it?

46:54.910 --> 46:57.069
Or did your job
just get a little easier?

47:02.239 --> 47:05.150
I got 70 cops retiring
at the end of the year.

47:05.181 --> 47:09.169
That I know of and no money for
an academy class.

47:09.174 --> 47:12.366
The Mayor fucked you 'cause
I know that money was in the budget.

47:12.538 --> 47:15.073
The Mayor delayed it
till next summer.

47:15.404 --> 47:18.095
Less troops, less salary,
less bennies.

47:18.595 --> 47:22.977
Even a six-month delay saves the city
two, three million.

47:23.617 --> 47:24.885
Lemme talk to some people.

48:34.464 --> 48:34.902
Yeah.

48:35.966 --> 48:36.744
<i>Major Colvin?</i>

48:36.764 --> 48:37.060
Yeah.

48:40.097 --> 48:41.633
<i>I'm sorry to call you this late,</i>

48:41.634 --> 48:44.029
<i>but we have an officer
down in your district. </i>

48:46.656 --> 48:47.532
Which hospital?

48:54.816 --> 48:57.507
I, ah, just got the lease, so...

49:09.514 --> 49:11.157
Fucking solo cars!

49:11.802 --> 49:13.444
I shoulda teamed him.
I fucked up.

49:13.898 --> 49:15.197
Dead-ass motherfucker's dead.

49:16.401 --> 49:18.357
We catch up to him,
he don't come in alive.

49:20.423 --> 49:20.813
Right?

49:31.877 --> 49:34.326
Nicked jugular, shattered jaw.

49:36.611 --> 49:37.267
He'll live.

49:45.918 --> 49:47.294
Hand me one of those.

49:52.380 --> 49:54.351
I just got back
from shock-trauma.

49:56.077 --> 49:59.003
You guys saved his ass getting
him down as fast as you did.

50:00.786 --> 50:02.148
So what we got for a suspect?

50:03.226 --> 50:07.057
Number one male, white t-shirt.
Baggy jeans, tennis shoes.

50:07.267 --> 50:09.959
In the wind, but we're
locking it down out there.

50:11.538 --> 50:13.260
So what's this
I hear about the gun?

50:15.497 --> 50:17.703
Doze tried to return fire,
he dropped his piece.

50:17.735 --> 50:20.174
Some fuck picks it up and books.

50:20.989 --> 50:22.427
I mean I can't
believe this shit.

50:25.516 --> 50:26.626
I'll take it.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.027
No, no, no...

51:10.062 --> 51:12.018
It'll be nicer when
I fix the place up.

51:13.129 --> 51:14.191
Cedric...

51:15.287 --> 51:16.523
I don't care.

51:27.701 --> 51:28.828
No, tell him I'm cooked.

51:28.859 --> 51:30.784
I just got done at
the hospital, I'm all in.

51:30.798 --> 51:33.349
<i>Well, he was askin' if you could
maybe talk to the reporters. </i>

51:33.381 --> 51:35.618
He doesn't want me talking
to reporters right now.

51:35.649 --> 51:36.025
<i>Alright. </i>

51:36.041 --> 51:37.528
That would truly be unwise.

51:37.559 --> 51:38.965
<i>Alright, alright,
I'll tell him. </i>

51:38.986 --> 51:39.424
Alright.

51:43.398 --> 51:43.805
Bunny.

51:44.525 --> 51:45.666
You look hellacious.

51:47.257 --> 51:48.634
You got coffee going in there?

51:51.325 --> 51:52.608
You know what I was thinking?

51:54.251 --> 51:55.378
Tonight's a good night.

51:56.394 --> 51:56.911
Why?

51:58.209 --> 51:59.646
Because my shot cop didn't die.

52:02.713 --> 52:03.448
And it hit me...

52:05.951 --> 52:08.001
this is what makes
a good night on my watch:

52:09.174 --> 52:10.424
Absence of a negative.

52:11.503 --> 52:12.520
That was a good night.

52:14.741 --> 52:15.478
Here's the thing.

52:17.824 --> 52:18.840
Six months from now?

52:19.575 --> 52:20.123
I'm gone.

52:22.181 --> 52:23.293
I put in my 30

52:24.091 --> 52:26.813
and the only thing that'll be left of me
on that job is an

52:27.360 --> 52:29.894
eight-by-eleven framed picture
in the western hallway.

52:31.831 --> 52:32.722
But you know what?

52:34.130 --> 52:35.163
The shit out there,

52:36.883 --> 52:37.650
the city,

52:38.494 --> 52:40.045
is worse than
when I first came on.

52:41.578 --> 52:43.268
So what does that say about me?

52:46.037 --> 52:46.959
About my life...

52:48.384 --> 52:50.433
Aw, c'mon, man.
You're talking about drugs.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.061
That's a force of nature.

52:53.358 --> 52:56.332
That's sweeping leaves on a windy day
whoever the hell you are.

52:57.582 --> 52:59.011
You fought the good fight...

53:13.333 --> 53:15.556
Not a call since
we gave it up to Cheese.

53:16.560 --> 53:17.531
What did you expect?

53:20.800 --> 53:21.441
<i>Attention. </i>

53:32.964 --> 53:33.543
Be seated.

53:41.796 --> 53:43.313
Regarding officer Dozerman,

53:44.987 --> 53:47.793
His condition has been
upgraded to guarded.

53:49.436 --> 53:50.922
'Till he can receive visits,

53:51.517 --> 53:53.097
he's beemoved to the recovery unit.

53:55.569 --> 53:56.712
As of this tour,

53:57.870 --> 54:01.188
all hand-to-hand
undercover buys of C.D.S.

54:02.219 --> 54:03.909
Are suspended
in the Western District.

54:09.002 --> 54:09.973
Somewheres

54:11.709 --> 54:13.007
back in the dawn of time

54:15.057 --> 54:17.183
this district had
itself a civic dilemma

54:17.810 --> 54:18.729
of epic proportions.

54:20.795 --> 54:22.688
The city council
had just passed a law

54:22.720 --> 54:26.302
that forbid alcoholic
consumption in public places.

54:27.277 --> 54:28.044
On the streets

54:29.279 --> 54:30.281
and on the corners.

54:32.157 --> 54:35.676
But the corner is, and it was
and it always will be

54:36.774 --> 54:37.806
the poor man's lounge.

54:38.944 --> 54:41.352
It's where a man wants to be
on a hot summer's night.

54:41.759 --> 54:43.027
It's cheaper than a bar,

54:43.464 --> 54:45.529
catch a nice breeze,
watch the girls go by.

54:47.124 --> 54:49.501
But the law's the law

54:50.853 --> 54:52.307
and the western cops rollin' by,

54:53.091 --> 54:54.280
what were they gonna do?

54:55.531 --> 54:58.384
If they arrested every dude out there
for tipping back a high life

54:58.399 --> 55:01.230
there'd be no other time
for any other kind of police work.

55:01.981 --> 55:03.623
And if they looked
the other way?

55:04.546 --> 55:08.051
They'd open themselves
to all kinds of flaunting,

55:09.479 --> 55:10.700
all kinds of disrespect.

55:14.780 --> 55:16.954
Now, this is before
my time when it happened but,

55:18.345 --> 55:20.801
somewheres back
in the 50s or 60s,

55:22.069 --> 55:23.743
there was a small moment of

55:24.432 --> 55:27.283
goddamn genius by some
nameless smokehound

55:27.284 --> 55:29.219
who comes out
the cut-rate one day

55:29.959 --> 55:31.430
and on his way to the corner,

55:32.385 --> 55:34.871
he slips that just-bought
pint of Elderberry

55:36.756 --> 55:37.616
into a paper bag.

55:39.588 --> 55:43.140
A great moment
of civic compromise.

55:43.923 --> 55:46.770
That small wrinkled-ass paper bag

55:47.636 --> 55:50.233
allowed the corner boys
to have their drink in peace

55:51.734 --> 55:53.219
and gave us permission

55:54.424 --> 55:57.165
to go and do police work.

55:59.308 --> 56:02.517
The kind of police work
that's actually worth the effort,

56:05.067 --> 56:08.585
that's worth actually
taking a bullet for.

56:11.526 --> 56:12.418
Dozerman,

56:13.639 --> 56:15.546
he got shot last night
trying to buy...

56:16.142 --> 56:16.998
three vials.

56:18.216 --> 56:18.826
Three!

56:29.134 --> 56:30.870
There's never been a paper bag...

56:32.150 --> 56:33.028
for drugs.

56:41.653 --> 56:42.529
Until now.

56:50.696 --> 56:53.137
If we ain't doing hand-to-hands,
then what the fuck?

56:54.951 --> 56:56.359
And that shit with the bag?

56:56.875 --> 56:58.220
What the fuck is that?
