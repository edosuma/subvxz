00:39.828 --> 00:41.107
And cut!

00:41.108 --> 00:43.987
- Wow. That was so amazing!
- Walter, you did a wonderful job.

00:43.988 --> 00:45.467
Thank you, Kermit. Did we get that?

00:45.468 --> 00:46.908
- We got it.
- We got it, yup.

00:47.068 --> 00:52.195
<i>Movie's over, people.
Go home. That is a wrap.</i>

00:52.708 --> 00:54.907
Okay, nice work, everyone.

00:54.908 --> 00:57.918
Make sure to fill out your I-9s,
and we'll see you on the next one.

01:03.668 --> 01:06.747
So... What do we do now?

01:06.748 --> 01:08.987
Well, we're together again.

01:08.988 --> 01:10.787
We got the theater
and all our fans are back.

01:10.788 --> 01:12.035
Yeah!

01:12.748 --> 01:14.507
Actually, those were extras.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.387
I saw a few tapping their toes.

01:16.388 --> 01:18.027
Yeah, those were paid dancers.

01:18.028 --> 01:19.307
Or...

01:19.308 --> 01:22.159
Maybe since we're all here,

01:22.188 --> 01:24.994
now could be the perfect time for
you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!

01:25.188 --> 01:27.187
Well, I mean, maybe I could.

01:27.188 --> 01:30.187
Hey, what's the camera
still doing here?

01:30.188 --> 01:34.187
Oh, no. Disaster! That
can only mean one thing.

01:34.188 --> 01:37.471
Doggone it, you're right! It looks
like they've ordered a sequel.

01:38.788 --> 01:41.587
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

01:41.588 --> 01:45.387
<i>We're back by popular demand</i>

01:45.388 --> 01:48.907
<i>Come on, everybody,
strike up the band!</i>

01:48.908 --> 01:50.907
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

01:50.908 --> 01:53.467
<i>That's what we do in Hollywood</i>

01:53.468 --> 01:55.347
<i>And everybody knows</i>

01:55.348 --> 01:57.707
<i>That the sequel's
never quite as good</i>

01:57.708 --> 02:01.987
<i>A sequel
Another feature attraction</i>

02:01.988 --> 02:03.587
<i>Places, please
Light the lights</i>

02:03.588 --> 02:05.438
<i>Roll camera, "Action!"</i>

02:05.548 --> 02:07.307
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

02:07.308 --> 02:09.667
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

02:09.668 --> 02:11.438
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

02:11.868 --> 02:13.947
<i>Do it all again</i>

02:13.948 --> 02:15.427
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

02:15.428 --> 02:17.227
<i>We got another go to show them</i>

02:17.228 --> 02:19.590
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

02:21.788 --> 02:25.547
<i>We're doing a sequel
There's no need to disguise</i>

02:25.548 --> 02:29.427
<i>The studio considers us
a viable franchise</i>

02:29.428 --> 02:33.387
<i>We're doing a sequel
The studio wants more</i>

02:33.388 --> 02:35.227
<i>While they wait for Tom Hanks</i>

02:35.228 --> 02:36.953
<i>To make Toy Story 4!</i>

02:37.668 --> 02:39.187
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

02:39.188 --> 02:41.227
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

02:41.228 --> 02:43.827
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

02:43.828 --> 02:45.747
<i>Do it all again!</i>

02:45.748 --> 02:47.307
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

02:47.308 --> 02:49.387
<i>We've got another go to show them</i>

02:49.388 --> 02:51.716
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

02:57.108 --> 02:59.507
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

02:59.508 --> 03:01.631
<i>Let's give it a go</i>

03:01.708 --> 03:02.909
<i>With Hollywood stars</i>

03:03.068 --> 03:05.507
<i>And more one-liner cameos</i>

03:05.508 --> 03:07.039
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

03:07.508 --> 03:09.667
<i>I don't mean to be a stickler</i>

03:09.668 --> 03:11.507
<i>But this is the seventh sequel</i>

03:11.508 --> 03:12.947
<i>To our original motion picture</i>

03:12.948 --> 03:15.307
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

03:15.308 --> 03:17.237
<i>Let's give it a shot</i>

03:17.828 --> 03:21.475
<i>All we need now is
a half-decent plot</i>

03:22.148 --> 03:23.907
Got it. An epic love story

03:23.908 --> 03:26.987
between a very handsome,
long-nosed purple thing

03:26.988 --> 03:28.427
and a beautiful chicken.

03:28.428 --> 03:30.787
<i>Gonzo with the Wind.</i>

03:30.788 --> 03:31.987
Does anybody have any other ideas?

03:31.988 --> 03:34.907
It's about getting the
Muppets back together again

03:34.908 --> 03:38.987
to stop an evil oil baron from
demolishing the old studio!

03:38.988 --> 03:40.792
Fozzie, did you even
watch our last film?

03:41.148 --> 03:45.267
It's about a frog who marries
a beautiful, perfect pig.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.835
And they have to kiss
each other a lot!

03:53.468 --> 03:57.559
I don't think Americans
watch subtitled films.

03:58.548 --> 04:01.638
Kermit, how about the
Muppets go on a world tour?

04:01.788 --> 04:03.319
That's perfect!

04:03.348 --> 04:04.787
<i>I thought it was the end</i>

04:04.788 --> 04:06.747
<i>But no, my friends, this is when</i>

04:06.748 --> 04:09.713
<i>We get to do it all again!</i>

04:11.508 --> 04:12.867
<i>Until the credits roll</i>

04:12.868 --> 04:14.987
<i>We've got another go to show them</i>

04:14.988 --> 04:16.872
<i>We can do it all again!</i>

04:20.588 --> 04:23.107
<i>We're doing a sequel</i>

04:23.108 --> 04:26.627
<i>It's more of the same
Let's give it a name</i>

04:26.628 --> 04:28.827
<i>How about The Muppets Again?</i>

04:28.828 --> 04:33.033
<i>It's the Muppets again
with The Muppets Again</i>

04:33.388 --> 04:35.590
<i>It's the</i>

04:37.389 --> 04:39.478
<i>Muppets</i>

04:41.069 --> 04:42.600
<i>Again!</i>

04:42.629 --> 04:43.988
- Okay?
- I'm okay!

04:43.989 --> 04:45.350
Okay!

04:48.909 --> 04:52.352
Booma-booma!

04:52.389 --> 04:54.114
Hey! Pepperoni!

05:39.109 --> 05:40.834
Come on!

05:45.109 --> 05:46.549
Let's dance.

06:10.989 --> 06:13.840
It's time to light the lights.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.148
<i>Muppet news flash.</i>

06:20.149 --> 06:23.148
<i>Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog,</i>

06:23.149 --> 06:25.548
<i>has escaped from
a maximum security gulag</i>

06:25.549 --> 06:27.388
<i>in Siberia, Russia.</i>

06:27.389 --> 06:29.828
<i>This move has
leapfrogged Constantine</i>

06:29.829 --> 06:32.668
<i>to the number one most wanted
criminal in the world,</i>

06:32.669 --> 06:36.032
<i>one place ahead
of the mysterious Lemur.</i>

06:36.629 --> 06:37.988
Wow.

06:37.989 --> 06:40.510
Thanks for seeing me at my
regular booth, Muppets.

06:40.989 --> 06:43.188
Big fan. Huge.

06:43.189 --> 06:45.708
Dominic. International
tour manager.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.468
"Dominic Badguy"?

06:47.469 --> 06:50.400
It's pronounced
"Bad-gee." It's French.

06:51.109 --> 06:54.308
It means "good man."

06:54.309 --> 06:55.668
Oh, yes.

06:55.669 --> 06:57.109
Listen up.

06:57.349 --> 06:59.828
You're hot. You're having a moment.

06:59.829 --> 07:02.628
But what is inevitable
about a moment? It ends.

07:02.629 --> 07:04.388
I don't want this moment to end!

07:04.389 --> 07:05.948
That's why we got to
get out there now

07:05.949 --> 07:08.348
and capitalize on this
moment with a capital yeah?

07:08.349 --> 07:10.788
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.

07:10.789 --> 07:13.068
Show a global audience
what you can do.

07:13.069 --> 07:15.868
Yeah, that sounds great
but I'm just not sure...

07:15.869 --> 07:18.668
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.

07:18.669 --> 07:21.508
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.

07:21.509 --> 07:25.508
Okay, I am inundated with offers
of management at the moment.

07:25.509 --> 07:31.308
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.

07:31.309 --> 07:33.868
Wow, that's a good list!

07:33.869 --> 07:36.868
And now, I wanna tour
manage you guys.

07:36.869 --> 07:39.228
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.

07:39.229 --> 07:41.428
We would share our managerial roles

07:41.429 --> 07:45.028
because you've got a special
bond with these little guys.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.515
Sure.

07:48.229 --> 07:49.388
President Clinton?

07:49.389 --> 07:50.708
What?

07:50.709 --> 07:54.028
I'm on my way, Number Two.

07:54.029 --> 07:55.588
Great, they're taking the bait.

07:55.589 --> 07:57.788
- Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.

07:57.789 --> 07:59.668
Humble and honest.

07:59.669 --> 08:02.908
I just... I think we have to
get settled first, you know?

08:02.909 --> 08:06.428
Hone the show, get some new material,
and then maybe go on a world tour.

08:06.429 --> 08:07.748
See you in Berlin.

08:07.749 --> 08:09.788
Yes. Auf Wiedersehen,

08:09.789 --> 08:12.276
Number Two.

08:20.469 --> 08:21.828
So...

08:21.829 --> 08:23.788
What's it gonna be, Muppets?

08:23.789 --> 08:25.268
Ready to be world famous?

08:25.269 --> 08:27.517
No pressure, but I
am a very busy man.

08:28.589 --> 08:30.837
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.

08:34.589 --> 08:36.148
World tour! World tour!

08:36.149 --> 08:37.948
Well, I mean...

08:37.948 --> 08:42.948
I guess we could always hone our acts
on the road, and that would be okay.

08:42.948 --> 08:44.308
Wouldn't it, Kermit?

08:44.309 --> 08:47.991
World tour! World tour!
Come on, froggy!

08:50.789 --> 08:51.990
Okay, let's do it.

08:52.149 --> 08:54.158
Dominic, you're hired.

08:55.949 --> 08:59.148
Thanks, Kermit. I mean, boss.

08:59.149 --> 09:01.397
You won't regret this.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.749
Is everybody here? Yeah?

09:07.750 --> 09:10.469
Okay, guys, guys. Get them
up and move them out.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.429
All aboard, Dominic.

09:12.430 --> 09:14.509
I didn't know there was
still third class.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.951
Third class? How about no class?

09:18.910 --> 09:20.829
Watch the heels!

09:20.830 --> 09:22.829
Piggy. Why do you need
so much luggage?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.509
For our honeymoon, of course!

09:24.510 --> 09:25.711
For our what?

09:26.350 --> 09:28.314
Let's go, guys!

09:30.670 --> 09:33.309
That must be reverse.

09:33.310 --> 09:36.320
Oh, well. This way looks good, too.

09:40.870 --> 09:44.629
<i>Okay, Dominic, I thought we could
start our world tour in London.</i>

09:44.630 --> 09:47.589
<i>Or how about the world
capital of comedy?</i>

09:47.590 --> 09:49.315
<i>Berlin, Germany.</i>

09:49.710 --> 09:50.911
<i>Germany!</i>

10:00.870 --> 10:03.072
Was that supposed to happen?

10:06.790 --> 10:09.675
<i>You guys are gonna love this place.</i>

10:12.150 --> 10:13.509
Okay, here we are, guys.

10:13.510 --> 10:15.069
The Hole in the Wall Club!

10:15.070 --> 10:16.229
"Die Muppets"?

10:16.230 --> 10:18.229
Looks like they put
the reviews up early.

10:18.230 --> 10:20.592
Yeah, or is that the
suggestion box?

10:23.630 --> 10:25.669
"Hole in the Wall Club"?

10:25.670 --> 10:27.389
More like "Hole in
the Ground Club."

10:27.390 --> 10:28.469
Okay, everybody.

10:28.470 --> 10:31.069
So, we'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.

10:31.070 --> 10:34.069
I've booked us into cabaret
bars and coffee houses

10:34.070 --> 10:36.716
all across the industrial
cities of Northern Germany.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.909
Dusseldorf, Hamburg,
Mudburg, Vomitdorf.

10:39.910 --> 10:41.509
Poopenburgen?

10:41.510 --> 10:44.554
Fozzie, we have a solid week
booked in Poopenburgen.

10:45.510 --> 10:46.589
This looks great.

10:46.590 --> 10:50.476
And I think we should commend
Kermit on his efforts.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.429
Thank you, Dominic. Thanks.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.869
Or, if I might be so bold,

10:54.870 --> 10:58.313
maybe we could consider
another venue.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.871
Another venue?

11:00.270 --> 11:03.349
To be precise, this other venue.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.069
Look at that theater!

11:05.070 --> 11:06.949
What? No, no.

11:06.950 --> 11:09.709
We don't have the money to rent
the Berlin National Theatre!

11:09.710 --> 11:11.949
We'll make our money back
when we sell it out.

11:11.950 --> 11:16.949
Kermie, I've always dreamed of
playing the Berlin National Theatre.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.629
<i>"Ich bin ein Berliner."</i>

11:19.630 --> 11:22.389
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!

11:22.390 --> 11:23.949
Watch it, buster.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.309
Guys, I'm not sure
we can do this, you know?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.909
Okay, let's put this to the vote.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.109
All those in favor
of believing in ourselves,

11:30.110 --> 11:31.516
raise your hands.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.749
That's not what I'm saying.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.521
And all those in favor
of just giving up.

11:38.150 --> 11:40.069
I can't believe I'm
voting for giving up.

11:40.070 --> 11:43.513
Good. Well, I'm glad
we made this decision.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.109
Wonderful!

11:45.110 --> 11:46.149
So cool!

11:46.150 --> 11:49.479
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.

11:53.390 --> 11:55.429
All right, gather round,
troops. Everybody?

11:55.430 --> 11:56.829
Okay, guys.

11:56.830 --> 12:00.069
Since we're playing such a big theater,
let's stick with what we know.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.669
We'll open with a cabaret number...

12:01.670 --> 12:04.237
Kermit, when do I do the
indoor running of the bulls?

12:06.670 --> 12:08.109
Mr. Kermit, sir?

12:08.110 --> 12:12.156
I would very much like to demonstrate
my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.309
Bunsen, why would you even
invent one of those?

12:15.310 --> 12:18.161
Why did I invent the
unexpectedly exploding cupcake?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.429
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?

12:22.430 --> 12:24.669
Muppet Ladder? That's
never, ever worked, Gonzo.

12:24.670 --> 12:26.829
Last time we all tried that
was 20 years ago

12:26.830 --> 12:28.869
and you ended up
in a cast for six months.

12:28.870 --> 12:30.189
Yeah, good times.

12:30.190 --> 12:34.509
Kermit, what if I do four
or five Celine Dion songs?

12:34.510 --> 12:36.109
You know Celine Dion,
she works in Vegas.

12:36.110 --> 12:37.469
No, Piggy, there's
no time for that.

12:37.470 --> 12:39.829
What about the band's
marathon jam session?

12:39.830 --> 12:42.069
Drum solo! Drum solo!

12:42.070 --> 12:43.635
No drum solo!

12:44.870 --> 12:46.071
Guys, guys, guys!

12:46.470 --> 12:48.309
We can't just do whatever we want.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.949
This is our opening night.

12:49.950 --> 12:52.517
Let's play to our
strengths, because...

12:53.550 --> 12:54.789
Well...

12:54.790 --> 12:57.349
Look, I didn't want
to worry you guys

12:57.350 --> 13:00.949
but if we don't sell this theater out,
it would mean the end of the tour.

13:00.950 --> 13:02.309
What?

13:02.310 --> 13:03.549
And maybe the end of us.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.029
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.

13:06.030 --> 13:07.277
What?

13:09.710 --> 13:11.029
Fine.

13:11.030 --> 13:13.389
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.989
Hey, I have an amazing
idea for an act.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.909
It's called "The Indoor
Running of the Bulls."

13:17.910 --> 13:20.749
Gonzo, I've told you, that
act is far too dangerous.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.396
Actually, Kermit, I was asking
Dominic what he thinks.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.029
Good grief.

13:25.030 --> 13:27.153
Dominic, Dominic! Five songs.

13:31.551 --> 13:35.278
"Sold out." Like we've
sold out a show in 30 years.

13:36.271 --> 13:39.270
Is this a good time to discuss
our upcoming European wedding?

13:39.271 --> 13:40.670
No, actually, I'm kind
of busy right now.

13:40.671 --> 13:41.750
Perfect!

13:41.751 --> 13:44.230
I have 23 swatches for the
seat covers for the reception,

13:44.231 --> 13:45.550
eight font choices for the menu,

13:45.551 --> 13:48.030
which, by the way,
we are not serving flies.

13:48.031 --> 13:49.670
Piggy, what are you talking about?

13:49.671 --> 13:53.350
I'm just trying to involve you in
some of the decision-making, dear.

13:53.351 --> 13:55.070
What about being involved
in the decision

13:55.071 --> 13:56.950
to get married in the
first place, huh?

13:56.951 --> 13:58.910
Kermit, you never let
me do what I want!

13:58.911 --> 13:59.950
Oh, yeah?

13:59.951 --> 14:02.070
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?

14:02.071 --> 14:03.750
I haven't even proposed yet.

14:03.751 --> 14:06.190
- You can do that on our honeymoon.
- What?

14:06.191 --> 14:08.710
That's insane! Do you hear
what you're saying?

14:08.711 --> 14:10.750
Insane? How dare you call
your fiancée insane?

14:10.751 --> 14:13.630
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!

14:13.631 --> 14:14.870
And, as a matter of fact,

14:14.871 --> 14:18.230
the way this particular conversation
is going right now... Well...

14:18.231 --> 14:19.637
I'm fine with that!

14:21.791 --> 14:24.597
Piggy. Wait! I'm sorry!

14:24.991 --> 14:26.397
Get out!

14:43.471 --> 14:46.950
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.

14:46.951 --> 14:48.430
They just prefer me now.

14:48.431 --> 14:50.670
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.

14:50.671 --> 14:53.510
Do you know what I think helps
sometimes in situations like this?

14:53.511 --> 14:54.670
What?

14:54.671 --> 14:57.310
A walk alone in the fog
in former East Berlin.

14:57.311 --> 14:59.275
Maybe along a deserted canal.

15:00.511 --> 15:03.601
Well, I guess a quiet stroll
is not a bad idea.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.710
Let the others know
I've gone, will you?

15:05.711 --> 15:07.470
Sure. I promise.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.639
Thanks.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.401
Corrine, come here!

16:00.231 --> 16:01.762
Boo.

16:11.711 --> 16:13.276
What just happened?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.112
What?

16:31.511 --> 16:33.315
Wait a second.

16:34.951 --> 16:37.270
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!

16:37.271 --> 16:39.510
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!

16:39.511 --> 16:41.990
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.

16:41.991 --> 16:43.317
Who?

16:45.111 --> 16:47.750
No, no! Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!

16:47.751 --> 16:50.477
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!

16:51.751 --> 16:54.230
Hey, hey! Hello! Somebody!

16:54.231 --> 16:56.790
Open up!

16:56.791 --> 16:59.039
I'm an Amphibian-American!

17:09.631 --> 17:13.631
It's not easy being mean.

17:17.590 --> 17:20.476
Has anyone seen Kermit?

17:21.631 --> 17:22.832
It's 15 minutes to curtain.

17:22.991 --> 17:27.037
Hi, guys. Look, it's Kermit, just
back from his afternoon stroll.

17:27.550 --> 17:30.470
Hi-lo! I am Kermit.

17:30.471 --> 17:31.670
What...

17:31.671 --> 17:33.310
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice

17:33.311 --> 17:35.513
sounds a little bit
different at the moment.

17:36.991 --> 17:39.510
See? Just calm down. Just relax.

17:39.511 --> 17:42.317
You are right. Dominic is terrific!

17:42.831 --> 17:45.310
From now on, let's
do whatever he says.

17:45.311 --> 17:47.070
All right. Yeah.

17:47.071 --> 17:49.310
Wow, that walk
must have really helped.

17:49.311 --> 17:51.470
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.910
I humbly beg your forgiveness.

17:53.911 --> 17:56.190
You're not getting off
that easy, bucko.

17:56.191 --> 17:58.041
Come on, Foo Foo.

17:58.791 --> 18:00.915
Bad frog! Bad frog!

18:02.272 --> 18:04.351
What is this? Let go, dog!

18:04.352 --> 18:06.431
Animal, stop it!

18:06.432 --> 18:10.071
Kermit has agreed that Dominic
is right all the time, man.

18:10.072 --> 18:11.191
Good.

18:11.192 --> 18:14.551
So, now that Kermit agrees
with me on everything...

18:14.552 --> 18:16.471
- I am Kermit.
- Definitely.

18:16.472 --> 18:19.191
Let's go and hang out
backstage, yeah?

18:19.192 --> 18:20.757
Okay, all right.

18:21.512 --> 18:23.391
Come, little friend.

18:23.392 --> 18:27.031
Let us get on with the show and
enjoy our family-style adventure

18:27.032 --> 18:31.231
during which we shall bond and
learn heartwarming lesson.

18:31.232 --> 18:33.791
Perhaps about sharing,
or waiting your turn,

18:33.792 --> 18:36.040
or the number three.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.762
Right, Kermit.

18:40.952 --> 18:42.153
Sure.

18:43.672 --> 18:46.391
Flawlessly executed. Bravo.

18:46.392 --> 18:50.391
What did you expect from
world's most dangerous frog

18:50.392 --> 18:53.391
and number one criminal,
Number Two?

18:53.392 --> 18:55.231
Yeah, I know. You're number
one, I'm number two.

18:55.232 --> 18:56.911
I think you mentioned that before.

18:56.912 --> 18:59.831
Now that we control
the Muppet tour, Number Two,

18:59.832 --> 19:02.433
phase one of our plan is complete.

19:02.672 --> 19:05.557
We are now positioned
to carry out greatest...

19:11.912 --> 19:13.271
- "Burglary."
- Yes.

19:13.272 --> 19:17.911
of all time, and pin it
on those gullible Muppets,

19:17.912 --> 19:22.800
who will spend the rest of their
miserable lives behind bars.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.238
Tonight,

19:24.592 --> 19:26.551
we steal the painting

19:26.552 --> 19:28.591
and then we'll have all we need

19:28.592 --> 19:33.958
to steal the unstealable,
the Crown Jewels of England.

19:34.192 --> 19:37.111
Ensuring that my name
goes down in history

19:37.112 --> 19:39.471
as greatest thief of all time!

19:39.472 --> 19:40.951
You mean our names, right?

19:40.952 --> 19:42.631
Of course.

19:42.632 --> 19:46.351
My name first, then spacebar,
spacebar, spacebar, your name.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.431
Sure.

19:47.432 --> 19:50.442
<i>I'm number one
You're number two</i>

19:51.472 --> 19:55.313
<i>We're criminals at large
But I'm at larger than you</i>

19:55.432 --> 19:57.231
<i>I'm number one</i>

19:57.232 --> 19:59.551
<i>You're number two</i>

19:59.552 --> 20:01.951
<i>I believe in equality</i>

20:01.952 --> 20:04.151
<i>As long as you get less than me</i>

20:04.152 --> 20:05.471
<i>- I'm one
- You're one</i>

20:05.472 --> 20:06.631
<i>You're number two</i>

20:06.632 --> 20:07.791
I'm number two.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.951
<i>You may think that you're smarter</i>

20:09.952 --> 20:11.551
<i>But I'm smarterer than you</i>

20:11.552 --> 20:15.473
<i>I'm number one
You're number two</i>

20:15.832 --> 20:18.511
<i>You're lucky to be number two</i>

20:18.512 --> 20:19.918
<i>Not number three</i>

20:20.592 --> 20:23.671
<i>I can see by the look in your eye</i>

20:23.672 --> 20:27.877
<i>You want to get a bigger
piece of the pie</i>

20:28.512 --> 20:31.351
<i>One day you'll get your chance</i>

20:31.352 --> 20:33.231
<i>But in the meantime</i>

20:33.232 --> 20:36.163
<i>You've got to dance, monkey, dance!</i>

20:36.312 --> 20:38.431
Really? I hate dancing.

20:38.432 --> 20:39.511
Do it!

20:39.512 --> 20:42.033
<i>Dance, monkey, dance!</i>

20:47.352 --> 20:50.635
<i>I'm number two
He's number one</i>

20:51.872 --> 20:55.271
<i>I can't believe I'm
working for an amphibian</i>

20:55.272 --> 20:58.431
<i>I'm number two
He's number one</i>

20:58.432 --> 20:59.631
I'm number one!

20:59.632 --> 21:01.631
<i>You know life's gone to the dogs</i>

21:01.632 --> 21:04.073
<i>When your boss is a frog</i>

21:04.472 --> 21:07.431
<i>I can see it's just
a matter of time</i>

21:07.432 --> 21:08.991
<i>Before he's gone</i>

21:08.992 --> 21:11.240
<i>And I'm at the front of the line</i>

21:12.512 --> 21:15.511
<i>It won't be long
till I get my chance</i>

21:15.512 --> 21:17.431
<i>But in the meantime</i>

21:17.432 --> 21:19.999
<i>I've got to dance, monkey, dance</i>

21:23.712 --> 21:25.277
<i>Dance, monkey, dance</i>

21:28.512 --> 21:30.441
Now, watch me.

21:39.592 --> 21:41.591
<i>- I'm number one
- He's number one</i>

21:41.592 --> 21:43.751
<i>- You're number two
- I'm number two</i>

21:43.752 --> 21:45.951
<i>That's it, kid
There you go</i>

21:45.952 --> 21:48.031
<i>Now step aside
This ain't your show</i>

21:48.032 --> 21:49.431
<i>- I'm one
- "I'm one"</i>

21:49.432 --> 21:50.751
<i>I'm number one</i>

21:50.752 --> 21:51.951
<i>Yes, we know</i>

21:51.952 --> 21:54.071
<i>- I'm...
- He's...</i>

21:54.072 --> 21:58.800
<i>Number one!</i>

22:02.272 --> 22:03.917
That's how it's done.

22:06.232 --> 22:09.083
15 seconds to curtain... Kermit?

22:09.952 --> 22:11.392
Sure.

22:12.152 --> 22:13.353
Okay.

22:15.112 --> 22:16.711
Have you studied
your Kermit tapes yet?

22:16.712 --> 22:21.156
Of course not. This is child's
play for frog of my talent.

22:25.632 --> 22:27.912
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

22:27.913 --> 22:31.162
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.

22:31.353 --> 22:32.554
It's...

22:34.113 --> 22:35.314
Oh, no.

22:39.273 --> 22:41.953
Kermit! Introduce the show.

22:47.313 --> 22:48.632
It's the Muppet Show!

22:48.633 --> 22:52.758
With our very special guest
star, Christoph Waltz!

22:59.473 --> 23:02.517
What is happening? Why am I flying?

23:06.313 --> 23:09.198
- What the...
- We gotta do something!

23:16.513 --> 23:18.752
Please welcome our first act,

23:18.753 --> 23:22.162
<i>Herr</i> Christoph Waltz
dances the waltz!

23:42.353 --> 23:46.274
Darling, you set my world on fire.

23:46.553 --> 23:49.404
Did somebody say "explosion"?

23:49.873 --> 23:53.592
No! He says I set
his world on fire.

23:53.593 --> 23:55.318
There it is again!

23:57.713 --> 23:59.756
Wait for me! Please! Wait for me.

24:07.073 --> 24:08.512
One more!

24:08.513 --> 24:10.044
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!

24:11.073 --> 24:12.274
Hey!

24:12.713 --> 24:14.912
It was vertigo.

24:14.913 --> 24:17.912
Not stage fright, if that's what
you're thinking, Number Two.

24:17.913 --> 24:19.114
Sure.

24:57.753 --> 25:00.160
Right, now to cover our tracks.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.159
Let's get out of here!

25:29.113 --> 25:30.272
CIA.

25:30.273 --> 25:31.552
Interpol!

25:31.553 --> 25:34.112
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.

25:34.113 --> 25:35.592
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.

25:35.593 --> 25:37.272
One of the stolen
paintings was on loan

25:37.273 --> 25:39.152
from the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

25:39.153 --> 25:42.112
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.

25:42.113 --> 25:43.832
Also, this is my travel badge.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.952
Here's my real badge.

25:45.953 --> 25:47.792
You must have been
looking at the wrong...

25:47.793 --> 25:49.154
- Badge!
- What?

25:49.793 --> 25:51.832
You've won this round, Pierre.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.832
- My name is "Jean."
- Okay, Shawn.

25:53.833 --> 25:55.152
It looks like we're gonna
be working together.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.632
But that doesn't mean
I have to like you.

25:57.633 --> 25:58.992
I didn't like you first.

25:58.993 --> 26:00.683
I didn't like you before I met you.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.592
So, what have we got?

26:03.593 --> 26:05.632
Two priceless paintings stolen

26:05.633 --> 26:09.952
and one average painting of
an obscure English colonel.

26:09.953 --> 26:13.432
This has all the markings
of the work of the Lemur.

26:13.433 --> 26:14.512
What's a lemur?

26:14.513 --> 26:17.632
Only the second most wanted
criminal in the world.

26:17.633 --> 26:20.192
And my personal nemesis.

26:20.193 --> 26:22.992
Unfortunately for me,
his identity is a mystery.

26:22.993 --> 26:25.712
No, literally, what is a lemur?

26:25.713 --> 26:28.041
It is also a rat-monkey
from Madagascar.

26:30.353 --> 26:32.078
Just as I suspected.

26:32.193 --> 26:34.475
This coin is his calling card.

26:34.633 --> 26:37.512
The Lemur, he is playing with us.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.392
I have a delivery
here for Mr. Eagle.

26:39.393 --> 26:40.594
Right here.

26:42.553 --> 26:45.563
And here's your rope.

26:47.313 --> 26:49.083
You were saying?

26:51.313 --> 26:52.872
Look at that.

26:52.873 --> 26:56.521
"Muppets sell out in
Berlin." Five stars!

26:57.674 --> 27:01.435
Kermit the Frog is
liking this news.

27:03.234 --> 27:04.845
Choo-choo, yeah!

27:05.194 --> 27:06.964
Tunnel.

27:28.234 --> 27:29.553
It's not there.

27:29.554 --> 27:30.793
You were wrong!

27:30.794 --> 27:32.833
Not so fast.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.957
Oldest trick in the book.

27:36.394 --> 27:38.033
Write it in lemon juice,

27:38.034 --> 27:40.193
then simply apply heat

27:40.194 --> 27:43.637
to reveal Colonel Blood's map.

27:47.234 --> 27:49.433
Of course, today,
the Crown Jewels lie behind

27:49.434 --> 27:52.604
the most sophisticated
security system on the planet.

27:53.274 --> 27:57.113
And this map, along with
Blood's key and locket,

27:57.114 --> 27:59.793
is the only way to
get close to them.

27:59.794 --> 28:02.193
Good work, Number Two.

28:02.194 --> 28:04.753
What does it say about
location of Blood's key?

28:04.754 --> 28:05.833
Right.

28:05.834 --> 28:08.113
Something, something.

28:08.114 --> 28:09.753
"Finest wooden teeth."

28:09.754 --> 28:11.240
That is not helpful.

28:13.074 --> 28:14.605
Wait.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.644
There's the name of a city here.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.964
Madrid.

28:29.314 --> 28:31.676
You've got the wrong frog!

28:40.514 --> 28:42.045
Hey, hey, hey!

28:54.594 --> 28:55.993
It's Constantine.

28:55.994 --> 28:57.719
- What?
- He's back.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.513
What are you doing?

29:00.514 --> 29:02.553
I'm not Constantine.
My name is Kermit.

29:02.554 --> 29:05.234
Constantine, always with the jokes!

29:07.314 --> 29:11.803
Good old Constantine. Always
trying to pull a fast one.

29:15.034 --> 29:16.315
Old friend.

29:16.514 --> 29:17.873
Since you are back,

29:17.874 --> 29:20.553
I guess you are in charge
of prison again.

29:20.554 --> 29:23.713
Here, take prison crown.

29:23.714 --> 29:26.953
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.

29:26.954 --> 29:28.599
Take, take.

29:32.914 --> 29:34.161
Thank you.

29:39.874 --> 29:41.405
Wait a minute.

29:41.674 --> 29:44.553
I've known Constantine for years.

29:44.554 --> 29:45.793
And he has never...

29:45.794 --> 29:46.953
Ever...

29:46.954 --> 29:49.233
Said, "Thank you."

29:49.234 --> 29:52.597
Because I am not Constantine.

29:55.914 --> 29:58.673
- How dare you?
- He's not Constantine!

29:58.674 --> 30:01.833
Let's throw him
in the recycling compacter!

30:01.834 --> 30:03.365
Yeah!

30:03.714 --> 30:04.873
Throw him in the compacter!

30:04.874 --> 30:06.073
But I'm already green!

30:06.074 --> 30:07.400
Squash that frog!

30:08.594 --> 30:11.559
Put the frog down.

30:13.274 --> 30:15.681
Or I will deploy.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.593
Where am I?

30:24.594 --> 30:25.953
The Gulag.

30:25.954 --> 30:27.393
A gulag?

30:27.394 --> 30:29.642
Gulag. The Big House.

30:31.394 --> 30:32.953
The Big House!

30:32.954 --> 30:34.201
Hit it, boys.

30:35.114 --> 30:39.114
<i>This is Russia's premier
state-funded hotel</i>

30:39.874 --> 30:44.398
<i>We're very proud
of our eclectic clientele</i>

30:44.634 --> 30:48.919
<i>Excellence in service since 1932</i>

30:49.394 --> 30:53.473

30:53.474 --> 30:57.113
<i>It's the Big House

<i>Welcome into the Big House</i>

30:59.154 --> 31:01.753
<i>You'll never get away</i>

31:01.754 --> 31:07.199
<i>It's no Hilton or no Hyatt

31:07.554 --> 31:11.679
<i>So please enjoy your stay</i>

31:12.914 --> 31:16.721
<i>Here's the dining room
The menu is minimal</i>

31:17.914 --> 31:22.073
<i>What the cook does
to the food is criminal</i>

31:22.074 --> 31:23.834
<i>Pull up a seat, frog</i>

31:23.835 --> 31:25.924
<i>Grab yourself a stool</i>

31:26.835 --> 31:28.874
<i>May I recommend</i>

31:28.875 --> 31:30.794
<i>You try our famous gruel?</i>

31:30.795 --> 31:32.034
<i>In the Big House</i>

31:32.035 --> 31:34.314

31:34.315 --> 31:37.074
<i>Life ain't bad in the Big House</i>

31:37.075 --> 31:38.954
<i>No, froggy, no</i>

31:38.955 --> 31:41.354
<i>Check out after 10</i>

31:41.355 --> 31:43.842
<i>Or 11 years</i>

31:45.115 --> 31:48.319
<i>Make yourself at home</i>

31:50.395 --> 31:54.566
<i>Accommodation here is far superior</i>

31:54.675 --> 31:56.474

31:56.475 --> 31:59.834
<i>You Will find in Siberia</i>

31:59.835 --> 32:03.634
<i>Let me know if

32:03.635 --> 32:05.514
<i>Everything is free</i>

32:05.515 --> 32:07.794
<i>Money back, guaranteed</i>

32:07.795 --> 32:09.714

32:09.715 --> 32:11.714
<i>You will not survive</i>

32:11.715 --> 32:13.954

32:13.955 --> 32:17.602
<i>Run for your life</i>

32:36.075 --> 32:39.594
<i>It's the Big House

32:39.595 --> 32:41.994
<i>Welcome into the Big House</i>

32:41.995 --> 32:43.954

32:43.955 --> 32:45.645

32:46.755 --> 32:48.445
<i>I'll keep the only key</i>

32:50.155 --> 32:54.644
<i>Now, please enjoy your stay</i>

32:57.075 --> 32:59.594
Listen, I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong frog!

32:59.595 --> 33:03.754
If you are not Constantine,
why do you have that mole?

33:03.755 --> 33:05.754
It's not real. Someone
glued it to my lip.

33:05.755 --> 33:09.554
As far as authorities are
concerned, you are Constantine.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.644
Glue or no glue.

33:12.035 --> 33:13.954
Make yourself comfortable.

33:13.955 --> 33:16.114
You're going to be here a while.

33:16.115 --> 33:18.914
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!

33:18.915 --> 33:20.480
Now, lights out!

33:23.795 --> 33:26.157
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.

33:28.635 --> 33:31.394
You have to wait until I'm,
like, out of the hallway.

33:31.395 --> 33:33.120
It's figure of speech.

33:41.115 --> 33:42.474
Okay.

33:42.475 --> 33:45.114
It seems that Blood's key
is hidden in a marble bust

33:45.115 --> 33:47.594
of his accomplice,
Godfrey the Unknown,

33:47.595 --> 33:51.834
which is kept in the Statue
Room at the Prado Museum.

33:51.835 --> 33:52.994
Perfect.

33:52.995 --> 33:56.514
We break in, steal the bust,
destroy it and grab key.

33:56.515 --> 33:59.234
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows

33:59.235 --> 34:00.954
what Godfrey the
Unknown looked like.

34:00.955 --> 34:05.080
Of course not. He was second
in command, so no one cared.

34:06.235 --> 34:08.674
And there's 250
statues in that room.

34:08.675 --> 34:13.039
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.

34:15.955 --> 34:18.554
<i>Excusez-moi</i>, Kermie.
Do you have a moment?

34:18.554 --> 34:19.995
Kermit.

34:21.034 --> 34:23.833
I just wanted to say
that I accept your apology

34:23.835 --> 34:25.514
and I'm ready to put
our little disagreement

34:25.514 --> 34:27.954
or whatever it was, behind us.

34:27.955 --> 34:31.594
And, perhaps, I was a little
too eager about our wedding...

34:31.594 --> 34:33.754
Pig, I have question.

34:33.755 --> 34:37.197
Am I wearing sign
that says "Bother Me"?

34:39.355 --> 34:41.762
What was that? What was that?

34:43.315 --> 34:45.674
I was in the middle
of evilly plotting.

34:45.675 --> 34:48.674
I do not like to be interrupted
while evilly plotting.

34:48.675 --> 34:51.074
If we're to get away with this,
you've got to keep up appearances.

34:51.074 --> 34:52.194
I am keeping up appearances.

34:52.195 --> 34:54.074
If you want the Crown
Jewels, stick to the plan.

34:54.074 --> 34:57.245
Do whatever the pig wants. Keep her
happy. Whatever she asks of you.

34:57.995 --> 34:59.765
Stupid frog!

35:01.555 --> 35:03.041
Stupid train!

35:03.995 --> 35:05.685
I don't want to talk
to you, Kermit.

35:06.755 --> 35:08.874
I said, I want you out!

35:08.875 --> 35:11.154
I don't think you
know what you want.

35:11.155 --> 35:12.434
Yeah, I do. I just told you, I...

35:12.435 --> 35:14.594
You're my lady

35:14.595 --> 35:17.434
and I'm your man, baby.

35:17.435 --> 35:21.034
And that's why,
if you stick with me,

35:21.035 --> 35:24.159
I can give you what you want.

35:27.195 --> 35:28.999
<i>Baby, stop right there</i>

35:29.195 --> 35:31.274
<i>Let me clear the air</i>

35:31.275 --> 35:35.446
<i>Baby, look into these eyes
Let me apologize</i>

35:35.835 --> 35:37.674
<i>I know what you're thinking of</i>

35:37.675 --> 35:40.274
<i>You're thinking,
"Where's the love?"</i>

35:40.275 --> 35:44.474
<i>Babe, the love ain't gone
It's here where it belongs</i>

35:44.475 --> 35:48.714
<i>I know what you're waiting for</i>

35:48.715 --> 35:52.755
<i>Well, you don't need
to wait no more</i>

35:52.756 --> 35:55.075
<i>I can give you anything you want</i>

35:55.076 --> 35:58.475
<i>Give you anything you need</i>

35:58.476 --> 36:01.156
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

36:01.396 --> 36:04.035
<i>Give you anything you want</i>

36:04.036 --> 36:07.235
<i>Fulfill your fantasies</i>

36:07.236 --> 36:10.555
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

36:10.556 --> 36:12.595
<i>You want a unicorn
I'll give it to you</i>

36:12.596 --> 36:14.875
<i>You want a puppy dog
I'll give it to you</i>

36:14.876 --> 36:17.075
<i>You want an ice cream cone
I'll give it to you</i>

36:17.076 --> 36:19.195
<i>You want a mortgage loan
I'll give it to you</i>

36:19.196 --> 36:21.315
<i>You want a satin pillow
I'll give it to you</i>

36:21.316 --> 36:23.635
<i>You want an armadillo
I'll give it to you</i>

36:23.636 --> 36:25.755
<i>You want a diamond ring
I'll give it to you</i>

36:25.756 --> 36:28.275
<i>You want a thingy-thing
I'll give it to you</i>

36:28.276 --> 36:32.162
<i>I know what you're waiting for</i>

36:32.316 --> 36:36.555
<i>Well, you don't need
to wait no more</i>

36:36.556 --> 36:38.755
<i>I can give you anything you want</i>

36:38.756 --> 36:42.235
<i>Give you anything you need</i>

36:42.236 --> 36:45.315
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

36:45.316 --> 36:50.647
<i>Give you anything you want
Fulfill your fantasies</i>

36:50.956 --> 36:55.241
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

36:59.196 --> 37:01.160
<i>- I'm singing
- Cockatoo</i>

37:01.236 --> 37:03.245
<i>- Yeah
- Kangaroo</i>

37:03.956 --> 37:05.475
<i>In Malibu</i>

37:05.476 --> 37:06.675
<i>I'll give it to you</i>

37:06.676 --> 37:08.795
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

37:08.796 --> 37:10.835
<i>- Cockatoo
- Cockatoo</i>

37:10.836 --> 37:12.795
<i>- Kangaroo
- Kangaroo</i>

37:12.796 --> 37:14.915
<i>In Malibu</i>

37:14.916 --> 37:18.677
<i>I'll make your dreams come true</i>

37:19.116 --> 37:21.115
Kermie.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.478
You are what I've always wanted.

37:23.636 --> 37:25.195
Excuse us.

37:25.196 --> 37:28.355
But we are all wondering, what's
the set list for tomorrow, chief?

37:28.356 --> 37:30.395
I don't care. Do whatever you want.

37:30.396 --> 37:31.515
What?

37:31.516 --> 37:33.002
Is he serious?

37:34.156 --> 37:36.675
Kermit, could I do
indoor running of the bulls?

37:36.676 --> 37:38.915
Sure, Zongo. Who cares?

37:38.916 --> 37:40.795
Wow! Thank you, Kermit!

37:40.796 --> 37:43.675
Kermie, if he can do his thing,
why can't I sing my five songs?

37:43.676 --> 37:45.435
Well...

37:45.436 --> 37:47.475
You can. Who cares?

37:47.476 --> 37:49.475
We don't have time
for all this stuff.

37:49.476 --> 37:52.035
We're up to a three-hour
show, Kermit.

37:52.036 --> 37:56.082
You are forgetting one thing,
small man with glasses.

37:56.556 --> 37:59.395
I can give you what you want.

37:59.396 --> 38:00.795
All right!

38:00.796 --> 38:02.595
Okay. Indoor running the bulls.

38:02.596 --> 38:05.083
Won't the show be terrible? Guys?

38:07.476 --> 38:08.677
I'm so confused.

38:23.116 --> 38:25.595
Where are you guys?

38:25.596 --> 38:29.118
Looks like I'm gonna have to
break out of here myself.

38:45.236 --> 38:46.475
It's The Muppet Show,

38:46.476 --> 38:49.407
<i>with our very special
guest star, Lynn Redgrave.</i>

38:51.756 --> 38:54.482
Yes!

38:57.116 --> 38:59.603
<i>Hi-ho! Kermit the Frog, here.</i>

39:00.516 --> 39:01.915
Hi-lo.

39:01.916 --> 39:06.280
Kermit the Frog here.

39:07.476 --> 39:12.115
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and me</i>

39:12.116 --> 39:18.562
<i>The lovers, the dreamers and cheese</i>

39:20.316 --> 39:22.518
Nailed it.

39:25.236 --> 39:26.555
It's <i>El Muppet Show</i>,

39:26.556 --> 39:29.475
with our very special guest,
Salma Hayek.

39:29.476 --> 39:31.440
Hey!

39:52.636 --> 39:55.115
- Would you look at that?
- No.

39:55.116 --> 39:56.806
Good idea.

40:20.517 --> 40:24.516
Yes! Hello and welcome
to <i>El Muppet Show</i>.

40:24.517 --> 40:28.756
Please welcome our opening
act, the Great Gonzo

40:28.757 --> 40:32.404
and the indoor running
of the bulls!

40:34.237 --> 40:37.600
Gonzo? Gonzo, I don't
want to do this.

40:37.797 --> 40:39.476
What? This is gonna be great.

40:39.477 --> 40:40.756
Are you sure about this?

40:40.757 --> 40:43.528
Nope. Come on. Let's go.

40:47.237 --> 40:49.716
- Where have you been?
- On stage.

40:49.717 --> 40:50.964
Why did the...

41:02.197 --> 41:04.996
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?

41:04.997 --> 41:07.876
Me. I did.

41:07.877 --> 41:10.239
Here they come again!

41:10.717 --> 41:12.596
Okay. Sorry about that, folks,

41:12.597 --> 41:17.325
but now put your hands
together for Miss Piggy.

41:38.197 --> 41:39.636
I don't believe it.

41:39.637 --> 41:41.956
They've managed the impossible.
What an achievement!

41:41.957 --> 41:43.316
Bravo! Bravo!

41:43.317 --> 41:45.676
What? You mean you actually
like this show now?

41:45.677 --> 41:48.642
No! They've made the show
even worse!

41:49.797 --> 41:51.806
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Amazing!

41:52.197 --> 41:53.356
Where is it?

41:53.357 --> 41:55.276
It's got to be here somewhere.

41:55.277 --> 41:57.276
Keep smashing, Number Two.

41:57.277 --> 41:58.876
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.

41:58.877 --> 42:01.045
Where is that key?

42:04.637 --> 42:07.124
The last one. It better be in here.

42:07.317 --> 42:10.999
He looks a little bit
like you, Number Two.

42:14.877 --> 42:16.436
Colonel Blood's key.

42:16.437 --> 42:18.162
Nice of him to label it.

42:18.357 --> 42:20.924
- So, where is the locket?
- There's more.

42:26.757 --> 42:29.636
Of course. That's where
Blood's locket is.

42:29.637 --> 42:32.196
In the vaults of the
Irish National Bank.

42:32.197 --> 42:37.642
Then I know where Muppet
tour must stop next. Dublin.

42:44.677 --> 42:46.686
Drum solo!

43:15.157 --> 43:16.996
A standing ovation?

43:16.997 --> 43:18.676
I am Kermit.

43:18.677 --> 43:21.608
I hope you enjoyed my show.

43:22.877 --> 43:25.916
I love you, Madrid!

43:25.917 --> 43:29.564
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!

43:30.677 --> 43:33.403
They loved me, Kermie!
They loved me!

43:33.637 --> 43:34.756
Guys?

43:34.757 --> 43:36.556
I'm not sure that was
such a great show.

43:36.557 --> 43:38.116
Like, what are you talking about?

43:38.117 --> 43:40.396
That jam was, like, totally epic.

43:40.397 --> 43:41.676
Exactly.

43:41.677 --> 43:43.436
And I'm glad to say
the Spanish reviewers

43:43.437 --> 43:44.836
disagree with you as well, Walter.

43:44.837 --> 43:46.276
They loved us.

43:46.277 --> 43:49.516
Five out of five <i>jamón serranos.</i>

43:49.517 --> 43:51.556
Those reviews really came out fast.

43:51.557 --> 43:53.596
And Citizen Kane only got
four <i>jamón serranos.</i>

43:53.597 --> 43:54.676
And more good news.

43:54.677 --> 43:57.916
Pack up, everyone. I've booked
our next gig. In Dublin.

43:57.917 --> 44:02.116
Oh, great! Now we all
have time to rehearse.

44:02.117 --> 44:04.116
Rehearse? Let's celebrate.

44:04.117 --> 44:05.236
Yeah!

44:05.237 --> 44:07.796
Yes! You deserve it, comrades!

44:07.797 --> 44:11.001
Go do whatever you want.

44:21.477 --> 44:24.442
Looks like we are busted.

44:34.917 --> 44:37.316
Exactly what are we doing today?

44:37.317 --> 44:39.916
I am doing my job.

44:39.917 --> 44:44.236
All we need to do is look at the map
with the blinky lights, and wait.

44:44.237 --> 44:46.117
This is how it is
done here in Europe.

44:46.118 --> 44:49.917
In America, we use 3-D
satellite LED displays.

44:49.918 --> 44:52.769
Not cardboard with Christmas
lights stuck through it.

44:53.038 --> 44:55.161
A blinky light!
She is blinking! Let's go.

44:58.318 --> 45:00.717
What is this? A toy?

45:00.718 --> 45:04.197
This is my car, Le Maximum.

45:04.198 --> 45:08.926
It is illegal now in most of
the EU for its massive size.

45:10.998 --> 45:13.804
It's so needlessly
spacious, I feel guilty.

45:18.638 --> 45:21.364
I hate Europe.

45:22.238 --> 45:25.442
<i>Madrid, here we come!</i>

45:26.798 --> 45:29.157
- Get out of the way.
- Stay on the road!

45:29.158 --> 45:30.769
Interpol!

45:31.998 --> 45:33.438
Watch out, everyone!

45:33.678 --> 45:36.040
37 hours. Not bad.

45:38.878 --> 45:40.397
The Lemur. I knew it.

45:40.398 --> 45:41.877
This doesn't make any sense.

45:41.878 --> 45:44.677
Why break in,
smash some priceless busts

45:44.678 --> 45:46.637
and then not steal anything?

45:46.638 --> 45:48.597
There must be something
bigger going on.

45:48.598 --> 45:49.717
But what?

45:49.718 --> 45:51.077
I've got it!

45:51.078 --> 45:53.929
Sorry. 2:00 PM. My day is over.

45:56.398 --> 45:59.757
Wait. Those weirdos, the Muppets,

45:59.758 --> 46:01.837
were performing next to the
crime scene in Berlin.

46:01.838 --> 46:02.877
And here they are,

46:02.878 --> 46:05.677
performing right next to
the crime scene in Madrid!

46:05.678 --> 46:07.677
You know what that means.

46:07.678 --> 46:09.997
- Yes, they love museums!
- No!

46:09.998 --> 46:11.197
They're suspects!

46:11.198 --> 46:13.157
Okay. Overtime.

46:13.158 --> 46:15.837
We must find these Muppets
before they flee the country.

46:15.838 --> 46:17.528
To the train station!

46:22.598 --> 46:25.278
Hey, Larry, want a
bite of my bocadillos?

46:27.958 --> 46:29.364
What the...

46:29.958 --> 46:33.128
Are you all <i>Les Muppets?</i>

46:34.278 --> 46:36.162
Wow, those are big badges!

46:36.438 --> 46:38.083
Thank you.

46:39.078 --> 46:42.680
Come, come. You must come with
us to answer some questions.

46:45.638 --> 46:49.037
<i>Kermit, let's begin
Describe the day you played Berlin</i>

46:49.038 --> 46:51.277
<i>We rehearsed,
and then we walked about</i>

46:51.278 --> 46:53.877
<i>We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut</i>

46:53.878 --> 46:55.677
<i>That night at 10:03</i>

46:55.678 --> 46:57.957
<i>Were you inside the
portrait gallery?</i>

46:57.958 --> 47:00.277
<i>My alibi is watertight</i>

47:00.278 --> 47:02.606
<i>The audience saw me sing all night</i>

47:02.718 --> 47:04.837
<i>Monsieur, we know you did the crime</i>

47:04.838 --> 47:06.997
<i>I was on stage that whole time</i>

47:06.998 --> 47:09.277
<i>Ask who sang Rainbow Connection</i>

47:09.278 --> 47:12.288
<i>Thank you, Kermit,
no more questions</i>

47:14.838 --> 47:18.077
I think it's time for
good cop/romantic cop.

47:18.078 --> 47:20.360
<i>Miss Piggy, you could
end up locked inside</i>

47:20.478 --> 47:23.197
<i>And now's your chance
to save your hide</i>

47:23.198 --> 47:25.117
<i>Gentlemen, I did not know</i>

47:25.118 --> 47:27.557
<i>It's a crime to steal the show</i>

47:27.558 --> 47:29.637
<i>Tell us how the art was taken</i>

47:29.638 --> 47:32.117
<i>If you want to save your bacon</i>

47:32.118 --> 47:33.957
<i>I haven't seen your missing art</i>

47:33.958 --> 47:36.317
<i>All I've stolen is audience hearts</i>

47:36.318 --> 47:37.717
<i>We'll catch the swine</i>

47:37.718 --> 47:39.437
<i>That did this job</i>

47:39.438 --> 47:40.917
<i>Give up the pig puns, creep!</i>

47:40.918 --> 47:42.997
<i>Go jump in a lake,
that's my suggestion</i>

47:42.998 --> 47:46.042
<i>Thank you, Piggy, no more questions</i>

47:46.318 --> 47:47.757
I think she likes me. Huh?

47:47.758 --> 47:50.437
I don't think your puns are
helping the investigation.

47:50.438 --> 47:52.277
<i>- You know, I think they did it
- No, they didn't</i>

47:52.278 --> 47:53.997
<i>Yes, they did and we can pin it</i>

47:53.998 --> 47:55.077
<i>If they did how did they do it?</i>

47:55.078 --> 47:56.157
<i>If they didn't how did they didn't?</i>

47:56.158 --> 47:58.437
<i>If they didn't then it's easy
'cause they simply didn't do it</i>

47:58.438 --> 48:03.037
<i>If they did it, then I knew it but
we've nothing that can prove it</i>

48:03.038 --> 48:04.239
Excuse me.

48:07.878 --> 48:09.877
<i>Let's go from the start</i>

48:09.878 --> 48:12.037
<i>What do you know
about the stolen art?</i>

48:12.038 --> 48:14.437
<i>I didn't know there was a plan</i>

48:14.438 --> 48:16.717
<i>Your accusation's far out, man</i>

48:16.718 --> 48:21.480
<i>The chances of us committing
a crime are less than .009</i>

48:29.758 --> 48:31.847
<i>I can do an Elvis impression</i>

48:32.478 --> 48:35.602
<i>Thank you, Muppets
No more questions</i>

48:36.678 --> 48:37.717
<i>- They didn't
- No, they didn't</i>

48:37.718 --> 48:38.837
<i>There's no way they did the crime</i>

48:38.838 --> 48:41.237
<i>- They couldn't, they're too stupid
- Not criminal masterminds</i>

48:41.238 --> 48:43.197
<i>We do not know who did it
But we know who didn't do it</i>

48:43.198 --> 48:44.477
<i>So we know who didn't do it</i>

48:44.478 --> 48:48.239
<i>Yes, we know who didn't do it</i>

48:48.598 --> 48:51.119
They're incapable
of being culpable!

48:51.718 --> 48:52.797
Hi!

48:52.798 --> 48:55.205
Come on. Let's go
over the files again.

49:15.719 --> 49:17.762
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.

49:17.959 --> 49:19.398
How did you know?

49:19.399 --> 49:21.727
It's the first escape
everyone tries.

49:28.319 --> 49:30.726
That's the second
escape people try.

49:37.119 --> 49:38.559
Oh, boy.

49:44.039 --> 49:45.240
Third way!

49:46.599 --> 49:48.238
Give up, frog.

49:48.239 --> 49:49.558
I have Netflix account

49:49.559 --> 49:52.158
with search keywords
"prison escape."

49:52.159 --> 49:54.198
I have seen every
prison movie ever made.

49:54.199 --> 49:56.208
Even the ones in space.

49:57.639 --> 49:59.598
Yeah, well... Hey, wait a second.

49:59.599 --> 50:01.558
That's them! That's my friends!

50:01.559 --> 50:02.806
What happened to them?

50:04.439 --> 50:06.238
"Dominic Badguy.

50:06.239 --> 50:08.278
"An interview with
the brains behind

50:08.279 --> 50:10.958
"the Muppets' triumphant
comeback world tour."

50:10.959 --> 50:12.160
What?

50:12.399 --> 50:15.918
It seems your friends
do not need you anymore.

50:15.919 --> 50:18.038
They have forgotten about you.

50:18.039 --> 50:19.764
No, no, no.

50:20.759 --> 50:22.927
They wouldn't.

50:24.479 --> 50:26.798
They couldn't.

50:26.799 --> 50:28.198
We're a family.

50:28.199 --> 50:29.278
"Family"?

50:29.279 --> 50:32.358
No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.

50:32.359 --> 50:36.359
People are only
ever out for themselves.

50:42.959 --> 50:44.758
Listen, Kermit.

50:44.759 --> 50:48.038
We have annual lighthearted
Gulag Revue coming up.

50:48.039 --> 50:49.558
It is that, or they riot.

50:49.559 --> 50:51.682
I thought you might help me.

50:53.039 --> 50:54.758
The thing is, Nadya,

50:54.759 --> 50:57.518
I'm sort of done doing that,
but thanks for the offer.

50:57.519 --> 51:00.038
This is not offer. This is prison.

51:00.039 --> 51:01.678
You are going to help me.

51:01.679 --> 51:04.518
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.

51:04.519 --> 51:07.643
Or I put you on The Wall.

51:07.999 --> 51:09.078
"The Wall"?

51:09.079 --> 51:11.805
Why would I be afraid of a wall?

51:18.159 --> 51:22.569
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.

51:27.279 --> 51:29.720
What time did you say
that rehearsal was?

51:37.599 --> 51:39.718
Okay. What about
this comedian bear?

51:39.719 --> 51:43.844
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.

51:44.759 --> 51:48.884
Maybe your "Lemur"
hunch is correct.

51:51.359 --> 51:53.198
Except for the fact
that <i>Les Muppets</i>

51:53.199 --> 51:56.278
play tomorrow night
at the Dublin Theatre.

51:56.279 --> 52:00.158
Which just happens to be next
door to the Irish National Bank!

52:00.159 --> 52:02.487
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...

52:03.759 --> 52:05.398
Correct.

52:05.399 --> 52:07.358
It's almost as if we're...

52:07.359 --> 52:08.878
Not so different

52:08.879 --> 52:10.126
after

52:11.079 --> 52:12.644
all.

52:12.839 --> 52:14.638
Come, come, <i>mon ami!</i>

52:14.639 --> 52:16.398
We must follow <i>Les
Muppets</i> to Dublin!

52:16.399 --> 52:17.805
To Dublin!

52:21.959 --> 52:23.285
Kremlin!

52:25.679 --> 52:26.926
Putin!

52:29.479 --> 52:32.489
No, what are you doing?

52:32.919 --> 52:35.158
- Okay, number five, baby. Blow.
- Come on.

52:35.159 --> 52:38.438
- There you go. You know the routine.
- Come on, Diddy Daddy!

52:38.439 --> 52:40.767
Hey, guys? Fellas?

52:41.719 --> 52:43.409
Whoa, man!

52:43.479 --> 52:45.090
Hey, did you see that?

52:47.039 --> 52:50.925
Do you guys think that Kermit's
been acting a little weird lately?

52:51.119 --> 52:53.003
No.

52:54.439 --> 52:57.688
You're probably right.
It's just me.

52:57.919 --> 53:00.520
Bad frog.

53:20.479 --> 53:21.919
Enough!

53:22.239 --> 53:24.238
You're all terrible.

53:24.239 --> 53:27.124
Fix this. Or it's The Wall.

53:29.119 --> 53:30.320
Of course.

53:30.679 --> 53:32.518
Guys...

53:32.519 --> 53:35.558
It's always good to start with
an up-tempo song and dance

53:35.559 --> 53:37.318
and then go into a comedy routine.

53:37.319 --> 53:39.278
But we like Boyz II Men!

53:39.279 --> 53:43.119
It is Big Papa's favorite song. Lot
of emotions in that song for him.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.399
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!

53:46.400 --> 53:49.410
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!

53:50.200 --> 53:52.439
There you go. How do you like that?

53:52.440 --> 53:53.719
Drum solo! Drum solo!

53:53.720 --> 53:55.239
When do I do the indoor
running of the bulls?

53:55.240 --> 53:58.039
What about the band's
marathon jam session?

53:58.040 --> 54:00.199
Four or five musical numbers.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.839
Quiet!

54:01.840 --> 54:04.839
Now, look! We are holding
auditions tomorrow.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.679
And if any of you
have a problem with that,

54:06.680 --> 54:10.726
any of you,
then my door is always open!

54:13.440 --> 54:15.159
Thank you, Kermit.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.761
This is what we've all
been waiting to hear.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.039
Teach us, Kermit.

54:20.040 --> 54:23.050
We will do whatever frog say.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.123
Put it there.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.839
Good night, frog. Nice work today.

54:33.840 --> 54:35.239
Thanks, Nadya.

54:35.240 --> 54:39.365
Even if your friends don't
need you, we certainly do.

54:39.600 --> 54:40.881
Good night.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.439
- Good night, Big Papa.
- 'Night, Nadya.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.679
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Nadya.

54:47.680 --> 54:50.159
- Good night, Prison King.
- Good night, Nadya.

54:50.160 --> 54:52.479
- Good night, Skullcrusher.
- Good night.

54:52.480 --> 54:56.287
- Good night, Danny Trejo.
- Good night, Nadya.

54:57.880 --> 55:01.879
<i>No one believes in family
in the Gulag, frog.</i>

55:01.880 --> 55:05.482
<i>People are only

55:39.880 --> 55:42.321
Well, well, well.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.284
What's he up to?

56:16.840 --> 56:18.121
Gentlemen.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.799
I need this review
to go into Friday's paper.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.799
Super positive. Five stars.

56:23.800 --> 56:27.447
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.

56:27.920 --> 56:30.202
I'm joking, of course.
Cash or credit?

56:32.320 --> 56:34.921
- What was that?
- Rats.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.004
Who cares?

56:41.360 --> 56:43.399
Hand these tickets out to
anyone who will take one.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.199
In fact, you may have to
actually pay people to come.

56:46.200 --> 56:48.839
It's the Muppets.
It's not gonna be easy.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.246
And I want a standing ovation.

56:51.360 --> 56:52.599
Oh, dear.

56:52.600 --> 56:56.202
Where does he keep
all those suitcases?

57:02.720 --> 57:04.126
Let's see here.

57:07.360 --> 57:09.483
What's Kermit doing on the
cover of this newspaper?

57:16.400 --> 57:17.931
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!

57:18.120 --> 57:19.199
Fozzie!

57:19.200 --> 57:22.239
Dominic's the reason we've
been selling out our shows!

57:22.240 --> 57:23.799
He's been giving away tickets

57:23.800 --> 57:26.399
and bribing journalists
to write great reviews!

57:26.400 --> 57:29.046
Why didn't we ever
think of doing that?

57:30.120 --> 57:33.079
I mean, that's terrible!

57:33.080 --> 57:34.639
The question is, why?

57:34.640 --> 57:36.239
And could it have
anything to do with

57:36.240 --> 57:39.399
why Kermit's been
acting so weird lately?

57:39.400 --> 57:40.559
Hey, wanna see something funny?

57:40.560 --> 57:42.999
Yes, Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.159
Fozzie, what does he have to
do with what I just told you?

57:45.160 --> 57:48.011
Nothing, but check this out.

57:48.600 --> 57:50.290
Look, it's Kermit.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.566
What did you do with Kermit?

57:55.840 --> 57:57.451
Wait a minute.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.287
Fozzie...

58:00.080 --> 58:03.519
What if Kermit has been replaced

58:03.520 --> 58:06.644
by this Constantine guy?

58:08.440 --> 58:11.963
Nah, that's impossible.
We'd all notice!

58:12.841 --> 58:14.042
Wouldn't we?

58:15.441 --> 58:16.802
Kermit?

58:17.681 --> 58:19.610
Are you there?

58:20.921 --> 58:22.200
Hello?

58:22.201 --> 58:23.641
Kermit?

58:24.601 --> 58:26.520
Everything's fine.
Let's get out of here.

58:26.521 --> 58:28.166
Wait!

58:29.281 --> 58:31.609
We should look around.

58:36.241 --> 58:38.842
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.

58:42.241 --> 58:45.440
Looks like he's planning some
sort of comedy heist bit.

58:45.441 --> 58:47.609
I hope not. Those never work.

58:48.961 --> 58:50.686
What's that?

59:00.001 --> 59:01.120
Oh, no.

59:01.121 --> 59:02.846
What, what, What? What?

59:03.441 --> 59:05.006
Oh, no.

59:18.121 --> 59:20.528
- We got to get out of here!
- Yeah!

59:20.681 --> 59:23.120
Not so fast.

59:23.121 --> 59:24.320
Where's Kermit?

59:24.321 --> 59:25.600
What do you want?

59:25.601 --> 59:30.125
You have wocka-ed
your last wocka, bear.

59:33.841 --> 59:36.040
- Bad frog!
- Animal!

59:36.041 --> 59:37.360
- Oh, good boy!
- Great job!

59:37.361 --> 59:38.801
Thank you.

59:43.001 --> 59:44.280
Quick! The freight train!

59:44.281 --> 59:45.687
Go, go, go!

59:55.881 --> 59:57.760
We got to go back! Warn the others!

59:57.761 --> 59:59.960
I tried. They didn't believe me.

59:59.961 --> 01:00:03.880
It's our word against his and,
well, he's fooled them all.

01:00:03.881 --> 01:00:05.720
Should we go to the police?

01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:07.560
We don't have any evidence!

01:00:07.561 --> 01:00:09.520
I feel terrible.

01:00:09.521 --> 01:00:12.960
I'm the one who talked Kermit into
doing this tour in the first place.

01:00:12.961 --> 01:00:16.449
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.

01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:19.560
You're right.

01:00:19.561 --> 01:00:22.400
There's only one guy in
this world who can save us.

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:25.360
Only one frog who
can restore order,

01:00:25.361 --> 01:00:27.200
bring justice,

01:00:27.201 --> 01:00:29.449
and set things right!

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.800
You are talking about
Kermit, right?

01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:35.685
Yes, Fozzie. Kermit.

01:01:19.641 --> 01:01:21.400
Good!

01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:22.762
Great!

01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:25.490
That's it, guys, that's it!

01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:28.441
That's good, guys! Come on!
And hit it hard!

01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:52.960
Okay. All right. Yes.

01:01:52.961 --> 01:01:54.287
Nadya?

01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:58.686
I think perhaps we should,
perhaps, keep it prisoners only.

01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:03.400
Of course. I just love Broadway.

01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:07.048
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.

01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:10.523
Okay. Thank you.

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.322
Okay, fellas, listen up.

01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:15.491
Here's who made the cut.

01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:18.651
Sergei! King! That's you.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:25.326
You are always right, my
beautiful amphibian prince.

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:29.166
I will never let you go.

01:02:37.442 --> 01:02:39.053
This is better.

01:02:40.242 --> 01:02:42.881
What's wrong? You only ever
knit when you're stressed.

01:02:42.882 --> 01:02:43.961
The bear,

01:02:43.962 --> 01:02:48.961
the little guy and their
dog, they are onto us.

01:02:48.962 --> 01:02:51.085
They got away.

01:02:52.882 --> 01:02:55.084
How are we gonna spin this?

01:03:00.482 --> 01:03:04.481
Comrades, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

01:03:04.482 --> 01:03:09.404
Walter and Fonzie
have quit the Muppets.

01:03:09.762 --> 01:03:10.921
Wait.

01:03:10.922 --> 01:03:12.841
You can quit the Muppets?

01:03:12.842 --> 01:03:15.521
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?

01:03:15.522 --> 01:03:18.081
We just did a whole movie
where he joined the Muppets.

01:03:18.082 --> 01:03:20.921
Yeah, we sure spent a
lot of time on it.

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.001
I'll say.

01:03:22.002 --> 01:03:26.332
Maybe even at the expense of other
long-standing, beloved Muppets.

01:03:27.162 --> 01:03:28.807
Come on, Robin.

01:03:30.242 --> 01:03:31.801
Coming.

01:03:31.802 --> 01:03:34.081
Well, as the old saying goes...

01:03:34.082 --> 01:03:37.092
The show must continue,

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.565
- in a timely fashion.
- Wait.

01:03:39.922 --> 01:03:42.521
Fozzie and Walter are
part of our family.

01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:44.921
We can't let them
go without a fight.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.241
Right, Kermit?

01:03:46.242 --> 01:03:48.201
I know this is hard, Gonzo.

01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:50.441
Walter and Fonzie
were my best friends.

01:03:50.442 --> 01:03:51.643
Kermit...

01:03:52.242 --> 01:03:53.761
Are you sure you're okay?

01:03:53.762 --> 01:03:55.281
Yes, I'm fine, pig.

01:03:55.282 --> 01:03:57.450
I could never lose you.

01:03:57.762 --> 01:03:59.241
You complete me.

01:03:59.242 --> 01:04:00.601
Kermie.

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:02.121
Guys, come on!

01:04:02.122 --> 01:04:04.401
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!

01:04:04.402 --> 01:04:08.163
Yes. Remember, I can
give you what you want.

01:04:08.722 --> 01:04:10.162
- Yeah?
- Yeah, right.

01:04:10.882 --> 01:04:13.688
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Say, has anyone seen Animal?

01:04:37.442 --> 01:04:40.930
Does anybody else feel like
we're traveling in circles?

01:04:42.602 --> 01:04:44.133
There it is!

01:04:44.242 --> 01:04:45.443
Finally!

01:05:03.522 --> 01:05:05.963
Do you have evidence
to frame the bear?

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.372
Excellent.

01:05:09.362 --> 01:05:10.848
Where are the guards?

01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:27.483
Stay here. I'm going
to check on the vault.

01:05:30.002 --> 01:05:31.249
Stop it!

01:05:44.562 --> 01:05:46.081
Colonel Blood's locket.

01:05:46.082 --> 01:05:49.092
Of course. Now grab it.

01:05:49.962 --> 01:05:51.201
Shawn.

01:05:51.202 --> 01:05:52.767
Someone's coming. Abort!

01:05:57.202 --> 01:06:00.690
I think I just saw something. It's
headed back towards the theater!

01:06:10.682 --> 01:06:12.841
- That was close.
- Too close.

01:06:12.842 --> 01:06:15.329
We need to move to
final phase three. "Wedding."

01:06:19.482 --> 01:06:23.732
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.

01:06:28.602 --> 01:06:29.921
Did you see anything?

01:06:29.922 --> 01:06:33.641
Not a thing. It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.

01:06:33.642 --> 01:06:35.173
Excuse me.

01:06:35.882 --> 01:06:37.761
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:06:37.762 --> 01:06:39.961
I have an announcement!

01:06:39.962 --> 01:06:41.209
What?

01:06:42.042 --> 01:06:43.243
Kermit,

01:06:43.682 --> 01:06:45.961
I'm in the middle of a song here!

01:06:45.962 --> 01:06:47.361
Miss Piggy.

01:06:47.362 --> 01:06:50.801
I have very important
question for you.

01:06:50.802 --> 01:06:53.243
Yeah? What are you doing?

01:06:54.962 --> 01:06:58.325
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:01.328
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?

01:07:02.802 --> 01:07:05.722
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!

01:07:05.723 --> 01:07:07.242
So?

01:07:07.243 --> 01:07:08.933
What do you say?

01:07:09.723 --> 01:07:11.362
It's beautiful.

01:07:11.363 --> 01:07:14.692
Yes! Yes! Of course! Yes!

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.933
I can't believe this!
After all this time,

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:19.645
it was finally just so easy!

01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:24.002
That's right, folks,
it's the Muppet wedding

01:07:24.003 --> 01:07:26.762
the world has been waiting for.

01:07:26.763 --> 01:07:28.762
We're putting our tour on hold...

01:07:28.763 --> 01:07:30.002
What?

01:07:30.003 --> 01:07:32.202
to be married in two days' time

01:07:32.203 --> 01:07:35.322
at the world's most
romantic location,

01:07:35.323 --> 01:07:38.333
the Tower of London.

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:42.842
<i>Here's a Muppet newsflash.</i>

01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:44.842
<i>The years of waiting are over.</i>

01:07:44.843 --> 01:07:47.362
<i>The biggest "Will they,
won't they?" of all times</i>

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:50.202
<i>has been answered
with a firm, "They will. "</i>

01:07:50.203 --> 01:07:53.602
<i>Kermit the Frog and Miss
Piggy are to be married!</i>

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:56.727
<i>That's right, folks. They're
finally tying the knot.</i>

01:07:59.763 --> 01:08:02.642
Well, at least they didn't
get the pot of gold.

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.686
No, they did not.

01:08:05.203 --> 01:08:09.408
I have never been to a more
ridiculous crime scene.

01:08:11.443 --> 01:08:13.362
The comedian bear, he was here.

01:08:13.363 --> 01:08:15.850
The Lemur. He, too, was here.

01:08:16.323 --> 01:08:21.042
Could the comedian bear and the
Lemur be one and the same?

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:24.402
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.

01:08:24.403 --> 01:08:27.282
But why would he steal
a bunch of old bones?

01:08:27.283 --> 01:08:30.721
The bones apparently belonged
to one Colonel Thomas Blood.

01:08:30.723 --> 01:08:34.562
He was the only man to ever nearly
steal the Crown Jewels of England.

01:08:34.563 --> 01:08:37.881
Wait! Where did the frog say
he was getting married?

01:08:37.883 --> 01:08:40.442
The Tower of London.

01:08:40.443 --> 01:08:43.082
The comedian bear
is planning on stealing...

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:44.322
- The Tower of London!
- The Crown Jewels!

01:08:44.323 --> 01:08:46.127
The Crown Jewels.

01:09:01.643 --> 01:09:02.921
Sir, where would you
like the flowers?

01:09:02.923 --> 01:09:04.522
Who cares?

01:09:04.523 --> 01:09:05.602
Hey, chief.

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:06.921
Hi-lo.

01:09:06.923 --> 01:09:08.761
We've all been thinking, and...

01:09:08.763 --> 01:09:12.682
Well, after you and
Miss Piggy get married,

01:09:12.683 --> 01:09:14.082
what's gonna happen to the tour?

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.602
And to us?

01:09:15.603 --> 01:09:20.402
Well, now you guys have
all the freedom you want.

01:09:20.403 --> 01:09:22.841
You don't need me.

01:09:22.843 --> 01:09:24.772
I'm done with Muppets.

01:09:26.843 --> 01:09:30.126
But, hey, it's been
a good run, right?

01:09:31.523 --> 01:09:33.612
Good luck.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:35.283
Kermit!

01:09:36.363 --> 01:09:39.772
Did he just say what
I thought he said?

01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:45.006
What are we gonna
do without Kermit?

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:48.250
The only thing we can do.

01:09:48.723 --> 01:09:52.291
Pack up, go to the wedding,

01:09:52.763 --> 01:09:55.364
and head back home.

01:09:58.203 --> 01:10:02.082
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:07.847
But this is so easy,
it just doesn't feel right.

01:10:10.003 --> 01:10:12.282
<i>This is my dream come true</i>

01:10:12.283 --> 01:10:15.722
<i>The day has come for
us to say "I do"</i>

01:10:15.723 --> 01:10:18.682
<i>There's nowhere else I'd rather be</i>

01:10:18.683 --> 01:10:22.002
<i>Nothing in the world means
more to me than you</i>

01:10:22.003 --> 01:10:24.602
<i>I've waited so patiently</i>

01:10:24.603 --> 01:10:28.122
<i>I knew you were the
only frog for me</i>

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.682
<i>Always knew this day would come</i>

01:10:30.683 --> 01:10:34.362
<i>It's written in the stars
It's destiny</i>

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:38.562
<i>So how can something so right</i>

01:10:38.563 --> 01:10:43.769
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

01:10:46.963 --> 01:10:51.202
<i>After all we've been through</i>

01:10:51.203 --> 01:10:56.045
<i>Why do I feel I don't know you?</i>

01:10:56.723 --> 01:10:59.802
<i>We'll settle down
and start a family</i>

01:10:59.803 --> 01:11:03.485
<i>Have a mini you and a mini me</i>

01:11:04.443 --> 01:11:08.364
<i>A little pink frog and
a little green piggy</i>

01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:11.654
<i>They'll learn to say hello
and say goodbye</i>

01:11:11.843 --> 01:11:13.090
<i>We'll grow gray and old</i>

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:15.651
<i>And live the quiet life</i>

01:11:16.763 --> 01:11:19.364
<i>Just you and I</i>

01:11:20.723 --> 01:11:23.562
<i>Hand in hand we'll stay together</i>

01:11:23.563 --> 01:11:24.682
Hey. Look at that sky.

01:11:24.683 --> 01:11:26.487
<i>Forever and ever</i>

01:11:28.323 --> 01:11:32.443
<i>So how can something so right</i>

01:11:32.444 --> 01:11:38.174
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

01:11:40.684 --> 01:11:43.455
<i>After all we've been through</i>

01:11:45.004 --> 01:11:49.843
<i>Why do I feel I don't know you?</i>

01:11:49.844 --> 01:11:52.723
<i>How can something so right
feel so wrong inside?</i>

01:11:52.724 --> 01:11:55.643
<i>How can something so good
leave me feeling so bad?</i>

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.323
<i>How can my dreams coming true</i>

01:11:57.324 --> 01:11:58.923
<i>Leave me lonely and blue?</i>

01:11:58.924 --> 01:12:01.723
<i>How come the happiest day
of my life is so sad?</i>

01:12:01.724 --> 01:12:04.763
<i>How can I feel the high
when I feel so low?</i>

01:12:04.764 --> 01:12:07.723
<i>After all we've been through
After coming so far</i>

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.653
<i>Is this my destiny?</i>

01:12:10.644 --> 01:12:12.763
<i>Where is the love that's written</i>

01:12:12.764 --> 01:12:17.128
<i>In the stars?</i>

01:12:17.244 --> 01:12:22.245
<i>How can something so right</i>

01:12:24.004 --> 01:12:29.529
<i>Feel so wrong tonight?</i>

01:12:32.324 --> 01:12:36.803
<i>After all we've been through</i>

01:12:36.804 --> 01:12:41.214
<i>Why do I feel I don't</i>

01:12:42.284 --> 01:12:44.486
<i>Know you?</i>

01:12:51.764 --> 01:12:53.728
Oh, Kermie.

01:13:02.204 --> 01:13:04.372
- Hey, the show's starting.
- Yeah!

01:13:06.204 --> 01:13:07.643
Lady and gentlemen,

01:13:07.644 --> 01:13:11.894
good evening and welcome to
the Gulag Annual Revue Show!

01:13:16.564 --> 01:13:19.290
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.

01:13:19.564 --> 01:13:21.129
Okay.

01:13:23.044 --> 01:13:25.363
Kermit! Kermit!

01:13:25.364 --> 01:13:26.645
Kermit.

01:13:28.324 --> 01:13:31.243
Fozzie. Walter. Animal.

01:13:31.244 --> 01:13:33.003
We're here to rescue you.

01:13:33.004 --> 01:13:34.563
Yes! And we've got to go right now!

01:13:34.564 --> 01:13:35.890
Yeah!

01:13:50.004 --> 01:13:51.083
Hey!

01:13:51.084 --> 01:13:53.283
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!

01:13:53.284 --> 01:13:54.363
Kermit, listen.

01:13:54.364 --> 01:13:56.323
An evil frog named Constantine

01:13:56.324 --> 01:13:58.803
has taken over the Muppets
and replaced you!

01:13:58.804 --> 01:14:00.603
What? Constantine replaced me?

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:01.683
Yeah.

01:14:01.684 --> 01:14:03.932
And he was working
together with Dominic.

01:14:04.604 --> 01:14:07.774
They're planning something
terrible, but we don't know what.

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:10.043
But...

01:14:10.044 --> 01:14:13.363
How could you not have noticed
that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?

01:14:13.364 --> 01:14:15.843
He looked like you
and he talked like you.

01:14:15.844 --> 01:14:17.883
Okay, he didn't talk that much
like you, come to think of it.

01:14:17.884 --> 01:14:19.483
But he said he had a cold.

01:14:19.484 --> 01:14:21.683
Animal know.

01:14:21.684 --> 01:14:23.283
"Animal know"?

01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:26.083
You mean, all this time, I've
been locked in a Russian gulag,

01:14:26.084 --> 01:14:28.243
no one, not one single person

01:14:28.244 --> 01:14:29.923
from the Muppets except Animal

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.809
noticed I'd been replaced by
an evil criminal mastermind?

01:14:33.004 --> 01:14:35.323
It sounds worse than it was.

01:14:35.324 --> 01:14:38.607
No. It's as bad as it sounds.

01:14:42.284 --> 01:14:44.486
I thought you guys
had forgotten about me.

01:14:45.844 --> 01:14:48.643
That you didn't need me anymore.

01:14:48.644 --> 01:14:51.123
We'd never forget about you.

01:14:51.124 --> 01:14:53.683
We need you more than ever, Kermit.

01:14:53.684 --> 01:14:56.091
Good frog.

01:14:57.444 --> 01:15:00.203
Late extra! Late extra!
Read all about it!

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.611
Kermit and Miss Piggy
to be married in London!

01:15:05.444 --> 01:15:06.805
What?

01:15:07.124 --> 01:15:08.485
Piggy?

01:15:08.844 --> 01:15:12.014
Piggy's gonna marry the world's
most dangerous frog tomorrow?

01:15:12.204 --> 01:15:14.163
Piggy and the gang are in danger!

01:15:14.164 --> 01:15:15.283
To London!

01:15:15.284 --> 01:15:17.009
No. Kermit!

01:15:19.124 --> 01:15:21.643
Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'm in a gulag.

01:15:21.644 --> 01:15:22.803
Sorry about that, Ivan!

01:15:22.804 --> 01:15:24.123
It's okay!

01:15:24.124 --> 01:15:27.083
No problem, Kermit.
It's easy mistake.

01:15:27.084 --> 01:15:28.763
Right. Thanks for not shooting me!

01:15:28.764 --> 01:15:31.483
Sure. No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.

01:15:31.484 --> 01:15:33.843
We have to escape, guys. Tonight!

01:15:33.844 --> 01:15:35.375
But how?

01:15:35.524 --> 01:15:37.010
Kermit.

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:38.803
Do you know where these prop
pickaxes and shovels

01:15:38.804 --> 01:15:40.123
are supposed to go
for this big mining number?

01:15:40.124 --> 01:15:41.689
Wait!

01:15:43.004 --> 01:15:44.803
I've got it!

01:15:44.804 --> 01:15:48.975
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!

01:16:02.845 --> 01:16:04.285
Oh, no, you don't.

01:16:06.445 --> 01:16:08.284
Nice try, Escapo.

01:16:08.285 --> 01:16:10.004
I sure hope this works, Walter.

01:16:10.005 --> 01:16:11.684
I have tried a lot of ways
to get out of here.

01:16:11.685 --> 01:16:14.484
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.

01:16:14.485 --> 01:16:15.604
Okay!

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:17.045
Gosh, I hope this works.

01:16:17.325 --> 01:16:20.444
Thank you, thank you,
everybody. And now,

01:16:20.445 --> 01:16:24.286
we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!

01:17:26.085 --> 01:17:27.810
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Bravo!

01:17:32.045 --> 01:17:33.770
Oh, no.

01:17:35.245 --> 01:17:40.406
Kermie!

01:17:40.565 --> 01:17:41.844
I can't believe that worked!

01:17:41.845 --> 01:17:43.604
We did it! Great work, guys!

01:17:43.605 --> 01:17:46.564
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!

01:17:46.565 --> 01:17:47.891
Yeah!

01:18:04.605 --> 01:18:07.012
That's a nice venue.

01:18:10.285 --> 01:18:12.164
The main entrance is
too well-guarded.

01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:15.016
I'm gonna need to get in
some other way.

01:18:17.885 --> 01:18:19.814
Here you go.

01:18:21.685 --> 01:18:22.804
You're the new guy?

01:18:22.805 --> 01:18:24.164
Yes, I am.

01:18:24.165 --> 01:18:25.484
Next time, wear a uniform.

01:18:25.485 --> 01:18:26.686
Right.

01:18:33.725 --> 01:18:36.804
Wow, Kermit, you were like
James Bond back there.

01:18:36.805 --> 01:18:38.764
Thanks, Fozzie. Okay, listen, guys.

01:18:38.765 --> 01:18:40.604
Walter, you and Animal
go look in the chapel.

01:18:40.605 --> 01:18:41.684
Right.

01:18:41.685 --> 01:18:43.924
- Fozzie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:43.925 --> 01:18:46.287
- Good luck, guys.
- You, too, Kermit.

01:18:48.965 --> 01:18:50.724
Piggy?

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:52.495
Where is she?

01:18:54.125 --> 01:18:57.454
Kermit, these are your clothes.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:00.604
This tuxedo is too tight.

01:19:00.605 --> 01:19:03.092
Someone's coming! Hide! Hide!

01:19:03.685 --> 01:19:05.410
Which room am I supposed to be in?

01:19:06.085 --> 01:19:07.935
Here it is.

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:11.847
I hate weddings.

01:19:42.925 --> 01:19:44.331
What the...

01:19:45.245 --> 01:19:46.364
There you are.

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:49.204
Well, don't just stand there
gawping, Number Two.

01:19:49.205 --> 01:19:50.804
Come in.

01:19:50.805 --> 01:19:55.886
Let us take this convenient
opportunity to review our plans.

01:19:56.085 --> 01:19:59.884
Once you've stolen the Crown
Jewels and framed the Muppets,

01:19:59.885 --> 01:20:03.404
ring the tower bell five times and
we will rendezvous on the roof.

01:20:03.405 --> 01:20:05.204
But what will you do
when you're married?

01:20:05.205 --> 01:20:06.884
Because the pig will
know everything.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.736
Once she's served her
purpose, kaboom.

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:13.133
It will be bacon for breakfast.

01:20:17.645 --> 01:20:18.924
Champagne fridge delivery.

01:20:18.925 --> 01:20:22.129
Put it over there on
the bear-skin rug.

01:20:25.885 --> 01:20:27.485
Thank you!

01:20:27.486 --> 01:20:29.370
It's show time.

01:20:31.646 --> 01:20:33.285
Fozzie, are you okay?

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:36.205
Yeah, I think so. How do I look?

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:37.805
You look fine. You look fine.

01:20:37.806 --> 01:20:39.565
Come on, we have to
go rescue Miss Piggy!

01:20:39.566 --> 01:20:40.845
Right! Let's go!

01:20:40.846 --> 01:20:43.525
The Lemur! I have you finally!

01:20:43.526 --> 01:20:46.045
And Constantine, the world's
most dangerous frog!

01:20:46.046 --> 01:20:47.125
No, no, no.

01:20:47.126 --> 01:20:50.845
As you might say, case sol-ved!

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:54.493
Perfect! Time for my annual
eight-week paid vacation.

01:20:55.446 --> 01:20:56.485
No, wait!

01:20:56.486 --> 01:21:00.005
What am I supposed to do with them
until the mobile holding unit arrives?

01:21:00.006 --> 01:21:01.085
On holiday!

01:21:01.086 --> 01:21:02.685
No, you've got the wrong frog.

01:21:02.686 --> 01:21:04.615
And stay there!

01:21:08.846 --> 01:21:12.448
And so you know, Number Two,
I have hired us help.

01:21:12.726 --> 01:21:16.205
The world's smallest team
of jewel thieves.

01:21:16.206 --> 01:21:18.885
Babies, meet your new boss.

01:21:18.886 --> 01:21:24.525
Genius, I know! Who would suspect
babies of stealing Crown Jewels?

01:21:24.526 --> 01:21:27.491
Look at their sweet faces.

01:21:29.126 --> 01:21:30.965
Let's see. Where am I seated?

01:21:30.966 --> 01:21:33.692
I'll need an usher.
Usher? Is there an usher?

01:21:34.486 --> 01:21:36.925
Yes. I'm the Usher.

01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:38.485
Pig or frog?

01:21:38.486 --> 01:21:39.725
What do you think?

01:21:39.726 --> 01:21:41.285
I don't know, man. Pig?

01:21:41.286 --> 01:21:44.045
No. Frog. I'm related
through marriage.

01:21:44.046 --> 01:21:45.486
What kind of an usher are you?

01:22:08.886 --> 01:22:10.205
You're up, little dudes.

01:22:10.206 --> 01:22:11.771
Go, go, go.

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:18.813
Down.

01:22:25.886 --> 01:22:27.247
Tip.

01:22:28.806 --> 01:22:30.007
Come on! What the...

01:22:34.606 --> 01:22:37.252
Dominic. Hey, Dominic.

01:22:37.566 --> 01:22:38.767
Shut up.

01:22:42.246 --> 01:22:44.653
The wedding, it's starting.

01:22:46.766 --> 01:22:48.775
She looks beautiful.

01:22:50.006 --> 01:22:51.285
Fozzie, we got to do something.

01:22:51.286 --> 01:22:53.445
This is so frustrating!

01:22:53.446 --> 01:22:55.045
Wow, would you look at that?

01:22:55.046 --> 01:22:56.816
Now that's a poorly made car.

01:22:57.766 --> 01:22:59.013
Let's get out of here!

01:23:27.886 --> 01:23:31.365
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.

01:23:31.366 --> 01:23:34.092
- Would you please stop talking?
- Okay.

01:23:47.566 --> 01:23:49.052
Dearly beloved...

01:23:52.326 --> 01:23:54.528
What! Code Red! Code Red!

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.765
Oh, come on.

01:23:59.766 --> 01:24:01.725
- Not a laser web.
- Pretty.

01:24:01.726 --> 01:24:04.565
Right. Go and get
the suspend-y ropey thing.

01:24:04.566 --> 01:24:07.005
- And my really cool skintight outfit.
- Yep.

01:24:07.006 --> 01:24:09.165
Shawn, come back from vacation!

01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:11.045
Constantine and the Lemur
have escaped.

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.930
The Crown Jewels are in danger!

01:24:30.806 --> 01:24:34.325
We are gathered here today
to witness the union

01:24:34.326 --> 01:24:37.605
of this pig and this frog

01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:42.209
in Holy Matrimony
before the presence of God.

01:25:09.967 --> 01:25:12.206
Do you, Kermit the Frog,

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:15.536
take Miss Piggy to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

01:25:15.807 --> 01:25:19.046
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:21.046
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:25:21.047 --> 01:25:24.046
And do you, Miss Piggy,

01:25:24.047 --> 01:25:28.006
take Kermit the Frog to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

01:25:28.007 --> 01:25:31.370
in sickness and in health,
so help you God?

01:25:32.767 --> 01:25:33.968
I...

01:25:36.087 --> 01:25:37.288
I...

01:25:41.047 --> 01:25:42.646
Just say "I do."

01:25:42.647 --> 01:25:44.690
This is what you've
always wanted, right?

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:47.886
I do?

01:25:47.887 --> 01:25:49.526
I'm sorry, is that a question?

01:25:49.527 --> 01:25:51.695
No, it was not a question.

01:25:53.087 --> 01:25:54.406
We have to do something, guys.

01:25:54.407 --> 01:25:57.366
Kermit, we've got to get
you close to Miss Piggy!

01:25:57.367 --> 01:25:59.251
What does this do?

01:26:04.487 --> 01:26:06.166
- What the...
- Piggy, it's me, Kermit.

01:26:06.167 --> 01:26:08.126
Come on, we have to get out
of here! The wedding is off.

01:26:08.127 --> 01:26:09.446
Oh, wow!

01:26:09.447 --> 01:26:12.332
Like, I kind of knew
he'd get cold flippers.

01:26:14.887 --> 01:26:16.293
Excuse us.

01:26:17.367 --> 01:26:19.886
No, Kermit! What are you doing?

01:26:19.887 --> 01:26:22.006
- Piggy, I will explain later.
- I cannot believe...

01:26:22.007 --> 01:26:23.686
Come here, frog!

01:26:23.687 --> 01:26:25.013
Where you going?

01:26:26.087 --> 01:26:28.406
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.

01:26:28.407 --> 01:26:30.486
What is going on at my wedding?

01:26:30.487 --> 01:26:32.132
- Gotcha!
- What?

01:26:33.447 --> 01:26:34.486
Animal, pull!

01:26:34.487 --> 01:26:36.806
What is happening here?

01:26:36.807 --> 01:26:39.086
Catch froggie! Catch froggie!

01:26:39.087 --> 01:26:41.486
Well, this is the best
Muppet wedding ever!

01:26:41.487 --> 01:26:44.054
Piggy, listen!
That's not me! I'm me!

01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:47.495
He's Constantine, the
world's most dangerous...

01:26:56.047 --> 01:26:58.136
Two Kermits?

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:00.246
Well, that explains a lot.

01:27:00.247 --> 01:27:03.366
How can there be two Kermits?

01:27:03.367 --> 01:27:06.646
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding,
this has got to be the most creative.

01:27:06.647 --> 01:27:07.846
Two Kermits!

01:27:07.847 --> 01:27:10.486
No, just one Kermit. Me.

01:27:10.487 --> 01:27:12.926
No, no, no. Do not listen to him!

01:27:12.927 --> 01:27:14.926
I am the real Kermit.

01:27:14.927 --> 01:27:16.966
That's ridiculous!
I am Kermit the Frog!

01:27:16.967 --> 01:27:19.366
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hi-lo, Kermit the Frog, here.

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:20.726
"Hi-lo?" It's "Hi-ho!"

01:27:20.727 --> 01:27:22.213
Would every Kermit be quiet!

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:25.726
Well, there's only one
sure way to settle this.

01:27:25.727 --> 01:27:26.928
First Kermit.

01:27:27.927 --> 01:27:31.526
Will you marry me?

01:27:31.527 --> 01:27:33.966
Yes, of course, let's go!

01:27:33.967 --> 01:27:36.366
The helicopter is waiting, my love!

01:27:36.367 --> 01:27:39.093
And you, the other Kermit...

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:42.366
Will you marry me?

01:27:42.367 --> 01:27:44.686
Well, I mean, I...

01:27:44.687 --> 01:27:47.206
I would. I mean, I could. It's...

01:27:47.207 --> 01:27:49.057
That's my Kermit!

01:27:51.087 --> 01:27:52.368
That's our frog!

01:27:53.567 --> 01:27:54.893
Kissy-kissy!

01:28:04.647 --> 01:28:07.418
That is right, Muppets!

01:28:07.727 --> 01:28:10.771
I am Constantine,

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:14.926
the world's most dangerous
frog and number one criminal!

01:28:14.927 --> 01:28:21.089
And a thousand times more
frog than this Kermit person!

01:28:21.967 --> 01:28:24.206
And now,

01:28:24.207 --> 01:28:28.969
I have only one thing
to say to you fools!

01:28:30.647 --> 01:28:32.337
Good night, folks!

01:28:36.847 --> 01:28:38.486
What is that?

01:28:38.487 --> 01:28:39.966
It's a bomb!

01:28:39.967 --> 01:28:43.926
This is where my patented magnetic
bomb-attractor vest can aid us,

01:28:43.927 --> 01:28:46.414
that Beaker is
conveniently wearing.

01:28:51.967 --> 01:28:54.329
What? What's going on?

01:28:58.607 --> 01:29:01.617
Wait! Miss Piggy's
ring is the bomb!

01:29:03.407 --> 01:29:06.366
Some of you guys grab Piggy,
and some of you guys grab me.

01:29:06.367 --> 01:29:07.648
Pull!

01:29:18.847 --> 01:29:21.129
That's only 800 years old.

01:29:30.648 --> 01:29:32.418
Nicely done, Beaker!

01:29:34.648 --> 01:29:37.127
Kermit! Help!

01:29:37.128 --> 01:29:38.367
- Piggy!
- Help!

01:29:38.368 --> 01:29:39.807
She's on the roof!

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:43.217
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!

01:29:45.768 --> 01:29:47.607
Number Two, you look ridiculous.

01:29:47.608 --> 01:29:49.327
Why are you wearing that?

01:29:49.328 --> 01:29:51.007
Because I am the Lemur.

01:29:51.008 --> 01:29:53.647
And the world's
new number one criminal.

01:29:53.648 --> 01:29:54.767
That's right.

01:29:54.768 --> 01:29:56.447
This is where I double-cross you.

01:29:56.448 --> 01:29:58.367
First rule of double-cross.

01:29:58.368 --> 01:30:01.687
You don't announce the double-cross
before you double-cross.

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:04.539
It's not even a rule
because it is so obvious.

01:30:07.448 --> 01:30:12.327
The Lemur is literally the worst
bad guy name I have ever heard!

01:30:12.328 --> 01:30:13.529
Let's go!

01:30:17.888 --> 01:30:19.207
Oh, no!

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:21.327
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?

01:30:21.328 --> 01:30:23.257
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.

01:30:25.528 --> 01:30:27.527
We're coming! Hang on, Miss Piggy!

01:30:27.528 --> 01:30:29.253
Jump!

01:30:30.128 --> 01:30:31.367
Shut up, pig!

01:30:31.368 --> 01:30:32.687
Kermit!

01:30:32.688 --> 01:30:33.887
We have to do something!

01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:34.967
I got it!

01:30:34.968 --> 01:30:36.847
There's only one way
we can reach him up there!

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:38.209
Muppet Ladder!

01:30:38.848 --> 01:30:41.619
- What the...
- Kermit!

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:45.054
Come on up, Chef!

01:30:45.528 --> 01:30:47.617
Watch the hair, bear.

01:30:48.368 --> 01:30:50.887
Give up, Constantine.
I've got you now!

01:30:50.888 --> 01:30:53.455
Bad move, frog.

01:30:53.928 --> 01:30:55.087
Kermit!

01:30:55.088 --> 01:30:57.647
Okay, Kermit, we're
coming to get you.

01:30:57.648 --> 01:30:58.849
Now!

01:31:01.728 --> 01:31:03.087
No, something's wrong.

01:31:03.088 --> 01:31:04.813
We're not moving.

01:31:09.408 --> 01:31:11.451
You're ruining my getaway!

01:31:15.248 --> 01:31:16.927
Hang on, Piggy! I'm coming!

01:31:16.928 --> 01:31:18.698
Go get 'em, Kermit!

01:31:20.248 --> 01:31:21.449
Kermie!

01:31:22.248 --> 01:31:25.007
Welcome aboard, Kermit.

01:31:25.008 --> 01:31:27.927
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

01:31:27.928 --> 01:31:30.495
I am the world's
most dangerous frog.

01:31:30.768 --> 01:31:32.287
Oh, brother!

01:31:32.288 --> 01:31:34.527
You may be the world's
most dangerous frog,

01:31:34.528 --> 01:31:36.093
but you're still a frog!

01:31:37.608 --> 01:31:42.127
No one tricks me into marrying them

01:31:42.128 --> 01:31:46.014
and then hurts my Kermie!

01:31:52.448 --> 01:31:54.367
What a woman!

01:31:54.368 --> 01:31:56.087
Yeah. My woman.

01:31:56.088 --> 01:31:59.132
And I believe this belongs to you.

01:32:06.328 --> 01:32:08.647
Well, I'm sorry I
ruined your wedding.

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:10.373
Oh, Kermie.

01:32:11.328 --> 01:32:13.610
I'm so glad you did.

01:32:21.328 --> 01:32:23.974
Okay. Can we get down now?

01:32:24.128 --> 01:32:25.534
We did it, guys!

01:32:28.488 --> 01:32:30.127
What an action sequence!

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:31.647
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.

01:32:31.648 --> 01:32:33.007
Thank you.

01:32:33.008 --> 01:32:36.527
Congratulations, weirdos,
you've saved the Crown Jewels!

01:32:36.528 --> 01:32:38.847
And you've caught my
nemesis, the Lemur.

01:32:38.848 --> 01:32:41.287
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!

01:32:41.288 --> 01:32:43.367
- I'm not adorable.
- He is adorable.

01:32:43.368 --> 01:32:44.687
You're adorable!

01:32:44.688 --> 01:32:46.167
Did you make that kitty-cat outfit?

01:32:46.168 --> 01:32:49.611
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!

01:32:50.008 --> 01:32:54.577
Well, <i>mon ami</i>, I guess
this is where we say goodbye.

01:32:54.848 --> 01:32:57.494
You go your way, and I go mine.

01:32:57.808 --> 01:33:00.647
Here comes the rain. Oh, boy.

01:33:00.648 --> 01:33:02.647
And I said I wasn't
going to do this.

01:33:02.648 --> 01:33:05.047
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.

01:33:05.048 --> 01:33:08.138
We're only saying
our final farewell.

01:33:08.888 --> 01:33:11.847
Goodbye forever!

01:33:11.848 --> 01:33:13.367
I'm going to miss you so much!

01:33:13.368 --> 01:33:16.253
I'm going to miss you,
my French friend.

01:33:17.328 --> 01:33:18.939
Whenever you're ready.

01:33:19.328 --> 01:33:20.768
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

01:33:21.568 --> 01:33:23.487
- Take them away!
- Take them away!

01:33:23.488 --> 01:33:25.567
- Thank you.
- <i>Au revoir</i>, Muppets.

01:33:25.568 --> 01:33:28.009
- Bye-bye.
- See you!

01:33:28.848 --> 01:33:30.047
<i>You're number two</i>

01:33:30.048 --> 01:33:31.247
- Sam.
- Shut up.

01:33:31.248 --> 01:33:32.688
Sam! Wait for me!

01:33:37.688 --> 01:33:41.087
You know, I missed
all of you so much.

01:33:41.088 --> 01:33:43.047
There he is, right there!

01:33:43.048 --> 01:33:45.887
Arrest him! Arrest that frog!

01:33:45.888 --> 01:33:47.927
Nadya? Wait. For what?

01:33:47.928 --> 01:33:51.608
For leading the largest mass
break-out in Gulag history.

01:33:51.609 --> 01:33:54.928
You will get 30 years. Maybe 50.

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:57.609
- But“
- No "buts," Kermit.

01:33:58.409 --> 01:34:02.528
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue,
and you didn't even say goodbye.

01:34:02.529 --> 01:34:03.928
- What?
- What?

01:34:03.929 --> 01:34:06.208
You are coming with me. Now, move!

01:34:06.209 --> 01:34:08.248
Fellas, listen. Easy.

01:34:08.249 --> 01:34:10.816
No, no, no! Kermit!

01:34:11.049 --> 01:34:12.739
Wait!

01:34:15.289 --> 01:34:17.288
We're sorry, Kermit.

01:34:17.289 --> 01:34:19.289
We're sorry that we didn't
notice you were missing.

01:34:19.769 --> 01:34:21.608
We're sorry we didn't
tell you often enough

01:34:21.609 --> 01:34:24.335
how much you mean to all of us.

01:34:25.289 --> 01:34:28.299
We're sorry we ever
took you for granted.

01:34:30.689 --> 01:34:34.408
But that's never going
to happen again.

01:34:34.409 --> 01:34:38.614
Because if Kermit has to
go back to the gulag,

01:34:40.649 --> 01:34:42.658
you'll have to take me, too.

01:34:43.369 --> 01:34:44.488
No.

01:34:44.489 --> 01:34:49.411
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.

01:34:50.649 --> 01:34:52.851
You'll have to take me, too.

01:34:53.649 --> 01:34:54.850
And me.

01:34:55.649 --> 01:34:59.171
Kermit, we convinced ourselves
that evil frog was you

01:34:59.449 --> 01:35:02.088
because he gave us
what we thought we wanted.

01:35:02.089 --> 01:35:04.132
When what we really wanted...

01:35:04.249 --> 01:35:06.008
What we really needed...

01:35:06.009 --> 01:35:08.008
Was you, Kermit.

01:35:08.009 --> 01:35:12.134
The actual, real you.

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:24.211
It would appear you
were right, Kermit.

01:35:25.409 --> 01:35:27.338
I guess this is your family.

01:35:33.169 --> 01:35:35.019
And families belong together.

01:35:37.689 --> 01:35:39.175
You are free to go.

01:35:39.689 --> 01:35:41.015
Forever.

01:35:42.209 --> 01:35:44.768
Kermit, did you hear that?
We're free!

01:35:44.769 --> 01:35:47.128
Nadya, thank you! Great!

01:35:47.129 --> 01:35:48.979
That's wonderful!

01:35:50.369 --> 01:35:51.695
Wait!

01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:56.528
Hey, guys, listen. We still
have to finish our world tour.

01:35:56.529 --> 01:35:59.128
And I know where we
need to play next.

01:35:59.129 --> 01:36:00.888
For one night only,

01:36:00.889 --> 01:36:02.932
Siberia, Russia!

01:36:05.369 --> 01:36:08.413
Yes, yes! I'll pack my
swimsuit right away!

01:36:09.729 --> 01:36:11.728
Wonderful!

01:36:11.729 --> 01:36:15.092
It's terrible. You will hate it.
You will hate it.

01:36:23.089 --> 01:36:26.208
Okay, guys, this is it.
The Gulag Finale!

01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:27.368
Here we go!

01:36:27.369 --> 01:36:29.697
A-one, two, three, four!

01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:35.568
<i>Together again, again</i>

01:36:35.569 --> 01:36:39.979
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

01:36:40.769 --> 01:36:44.488
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

01:36:44.489 --> 01:36:48.368
<i>It's not starting over
It's just going on</i>

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.848
<i>Together again, again</i>

01:36:50.849 --> 01:36:51.928
<i>Now we're here</i>

01:36:51.929 --> 01:36:55.888
<i>And there's no need
remembering when</i>

01:36:55.889 --> 01:36:59.935
<i>Because no feeling
feels like that feeling</i>

01:37:00.769 --> 01:37:02.608
<i>Together again</i>

01:37:02.609 --> 01:37:05.130
<i>Again, again, again</i>

01:37:08.409 --> 01:37:10.208
<i>Together again, again</i>

01:37:10.209 --> 01:37:14.494
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

01:37:14.969 --> 01:37:18.048
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

01:37:18.049 --> 01:37:19.768
<i>It's not starting over</i>

01:37:19.769 --> 01:37:21.608
<i>It's just going on</i>

01:37:21.609 --> 01:37:23.648
<i>Together again, again</i>

01:37:23.649 --> 01:37:24.888
<i>Now we're here</i>

01:37:24.889 --> 01:37:27.660
<i>And there's no need
remembering when</i>

01:37:27.889 --> 01:37:31.696
<i>'Cause no feeling feels
like that feeling</i>

01:37:32.089 --> 01:37:33.768
<i>Together again</i>

01:37:33.769 --> 01:37:35.016
<i>Again</i>

01:37:50.809 --> 01:37:55.088
<i>I just can't imagine
that you've ever been gone</i>

01:37:55.089 --> 01:37:59.128
<i>It's not starting over
It's just going on</i>

01:37:59.129 --> 01:38:00.848
<i>Together again, again</i>

01:38:00.849 --> 01:38:05.288
<i>Gee, it's good to be
together again, again</i>

01:38:05.289 --> 01:38:09.130
<i>'Cause no feeling feels
like that feeling</i>

01:38:09.329 --> 01:38:12.928
<i>Together a-...</i>

01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:16.690
<i>Together again!</i>

01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:31.653
Okay, Nadya, this is it. Your solo.

01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:41.137
<i>Kermit!</i>

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:03.656
Oh, boy.

01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:06.696
- Hey, pull the rope!
- Oh, right.

01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:12.493
This cast is really heavy.

01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:14.249
Rowlf, come here.
Come here, come here.

01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:15.329
Yeah, what do you got there?

01:41:15.330 --> 01:41:16.577
Take this.

01:41:20.010 --> 01:41:22.577
You should have negotiated
a smaller font size.

01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:37.969
I believe I may have
something that could help.

01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:41.409
This is my automated
end-crawl operating machine.

01:41:41.410 --> 01:41:46.013
All I have to do is push this button
and it will crawl all by itself.

01:41:51.570 --> 01:41:53.260
Let's try this.

01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:58.421
Another qualified success.

01:44:54.371 --> 01:44:55.697
Check this out.

01:47:06.491 --> 01:47:09.900
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
