00:04.302 --> 00:07.184
Hi, honey. Welcome
home from work.

00:07.218 --> 00:09.432
Oh, god, I
love saying that.

00:09.468 --> 00:13.924
It's much better than saying, welcome
home from loitering at the head shop.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.927
Oh, my god, hyde. Five seconds have gone
by, and you haven't ripped off your tie,

00:17.960 --> 00:21.517
or as you refer to it,
"the yoke of oppression."

00:22.096 --> 00:23.596
Yeah, forgot
I was wearin' it.

00:23.647 --> 00:25.248
Would you look at that?

00:25.383 --> 00:28.720
The dancing bear has become
accustomed to his cage.

00:29.850 --> 00:32.783
Why would you put
a dancing bear in a cage?

00:33.684 --> 00:36.971
He's entertaining you,
give him some room.

00:37.670 --> 00:42.460
No, fez, what she's saying is that hyde is
becoming a money-grubbing corporate zombie.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.650
Did you hear that, steven?
We're gonna be rich!

00:46.130 --> 00:47.730
No, we're not, jackie.

00:47.770 --> 00:51.310
I hate the man. I'm still
dedicated to kicking his ass.

00:51.479 --> 00:55.929
I'm just doing it from the inside, where
I get a pension and dental and stuff.

00:56.372 --> 00:59.052
Oh, don't worry, honey.
You're still a rebel.

00:59.086 --> 01:02.895
Give me two years, I'll have him speaking
french and writing thank-you notes.

01:05.474 --> 01:08.106
hyde's growin'
up so fast.

01:08.679 --> 01:13.635
It seems like just yesterday, we were swipin'
"playboys," trenchin'old man shinsky's yard

01:13.669 --> 01:16.793
and cuttin' the brakes
on fat marvin's bike.

01:17.299 --> 01:20.086
I don't remember trenching
old man shinsky's yard.

01:20.136 --> 01:22.052
Oh, that's 'cause
you didn't approve.

01:22.092 --> 01:27.553
I think your exact words were,
"that guy's worked hard on his yard."

01:28.885 --> 01:30.183
What's wrong with me?

01:30.211 --> 01:35.302
Yeah, I don't want to wake up in 20 years and
realize that I haven't harassed enough grouchy old men.

01:35.892 --> 01:40.409
And I don't want to wake up in 20 years
and realize this was all a dream.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.687
Wouldn't that be weird,

01:45.053 --> 01:47.682
if none of this was real?

01:49.806 --> 01:52.385
Okay, now I'm starting
to freak out a little.

01:53.099 --> 01:55.863
You know what?
I want to trench a yard.

01:55.897 --> 01:58.847
Just not if it's one of those pranks
that involves heights or

01:58.898 --> 02:01.493
touching bugs.
I'm not--I-I...

02:01.881 --> 02:03.758
I won't touch a bug.

02:04.517 --> 02:10.197
No, you just park your car on someone's yard, and then
you step on the gas, throw it in drive, and tear up the lawn.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.653
Then you go get fries and talk
about how awesome it was.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.561
You know what, you guys?

02:15.612 --> 02:18.697
I'm gonna trench old man shinsky's yard.
In fact, I'm gonna trench that yard

02:18.730 --> 02:22.439
like no yard has been trenched
in the history of yard trenching.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.276
Are you with me?

02:24.343 --> 02:26.148
- Whatever.
- Yeah.

02:26.654 --> 02:30.261
I said, are you with me?!

02:30.312 --> 02:31.947
- Whatever.
- Yeah.

02:32.031 --> 02:34.846
yeah! That's what
I like to hear.

02:37.395 --> 02:40.632

What are those for?

03:19.148 --> 03:21.668
oh, no.
What did you do?

03:24.247 --> 03:28.770
Why did you have to wear something so revealing?
It's just a friendly party, for pete's sake.

03:28.820 --> 03:32.399
This party's not for pete.
It's for kitty, dummy.

03:33.742 --> 03:35.934
They've been arguing
all the time lately.

03:35.984 --> 03:40.198
Last night they did two hours on
"I know you are, but what am I"?

03:40.603 --> 03:42.592
Did someone say party?

03:42.642 --> 03:46.435
There's no party.
Right, kitty?

03:47.463 --> 03:49.576
Yes, there is
a party, red.

03:49.626 --> 03:53.062
Didn't you wonder why
I bought all that liquor?

03:53.806 --> 03:55.947
Honestly, no.

03:57.296 --> 04:00.484
Hey, thanks for inviting us
to your party, Mrs. Forman.

04:00.535 --> 04:03.586
We can't stay, though,
'cause eric's gonna trench...

04:04.783 --> 04:06.367
a coat.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.840
A trench coat.

04:11.121 --> 04:14.252
Kitty, how could you have
a party without telling me?

04:14.286 --> 04:17.488
Maybe it's because every time she
tells you, you go through five stages

04:17.522 --> 04:21.051
anger, fury, rage,
super rage, and, finally,

04:21.101 --> 04:23.394
cursing god for bringing
you into this world.

04:24.388 --> 04:26.046
I've been there.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.024
Why did you do it?!

04:31.389 --> 04:34.187
So what's the
occasion, kitty?

04:34.238 --> 04:36.885
According to
"cosmo"'s latest quiz,

04:36.936 --> 04:40.981
I have medium
to lowself-esteem.

04:41.076 --> 04:42.274
So

04:42.532 --> 04:47.831
the article suggested that I should
throw a party in celebration of me.

04:48.370 --> 04:50.072
I've done that.
I've done that.

04:50.578 --> 04:51.949
- You've have, too?
- Isn't it fun?

04:51.983 --> 04:53.416
- Yeah.
- I know.

04:59.096 --> 05:03.373
okay, guys, I've been thinking about this
trenching thing, and it's a little boring.

05:03.407 --> 05:06.306
But I think I've figured out
a way to forman-ize it.

05:06.728 --> 05:09.273
You mean, make
it more boring?

05:10.436 --> 05:11.807
No, I don't.

05:12.060 --> 05:14.167
I mean, I'm going
to get out of the car,

05:14.201 --> 05:18.212
moon old man shinsky
and then trench the yard.

05:18.381 --> 05:23.427
That's right. You've all now been witness
to the invention of the "moon 'n' trench."

05:24.067 --> 05:26.073
I don't know, eric.
It seems risky.

05:26.141 --> 05:30.326
I mean, you're not fast, you're
uncoordinated, and you're easily tripped.

05:31.877 --> 05:34.860
I mean, if you get out of
the car, you're a dead man.

05:35.096 --> 05:39.908
Not with me backin' him up
as his first lieutenant.

05:40.127 --> 05:45.471
Oh, um, actually, you're not my first
lieutenant. Donna's my first lieutenant.

05:46.195 --> 05:48.892
I went from fiancée
to first lieutenant?

05:49.145 --> 05:50.747
What a year.

05:52.414 --> 05:55.971
How could you
pick a girl over me?

05:56.258 --> 06:00.758
Kelso, remember when we put eggs
in sister mary catherine's mail slot,

06:00.809 --> 06:02.940
and you were
the getaway driver?

06:03.278 --> 06:05.587
And when we needed
to get away,

06:05.823 --> 06:08.250
you had left to
get ice cream?

06:09.447 --> 06:13.483
I was the getaway driver,
and I got away.

06:14.057 --> 06:18.861
Man, you've got forman, kelso,
an old man and a naked butt.

06:19.535 --> 06:22.754
This could go the kind of wrong
people write books about.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.886
I can't believe
I'm not goin'.

06:25.936 --> 06:31.819
Oh,  that's right. See, steven decided he'd rather hang
out with his father at kitty's grown-up cocktail party.

06:32.780 --> 06:37.316
I'm hyde. I'm goin'
to a cocktail party.

06:37.704 --> 06:42.002
I'm hyde. I'm going to a
party with cocktails.

06:47.801 --> 06:49.722
what the hell are
you guys doing?

06:49.874 --> 06:52.082
I don't know,
but it's funny.

06:58.157 --> 06:59.219
Kitty,

06:59.455 --> 07:00.922
who are all
these people?

07:01.124 --> 07:02.793
Well, they're
my friends.

07:02.877 --> 07:06.687
I never introduced you
because I know you don't care.

07:07.369 --> 07:08.667
Thanks.

07:10.251 --> 07:12.038
Hey,  W.B.,
Come on in.

07:12.089 --> 07:14.196
Hey, steven. I thought I
had the wrong night.

07:14.229 --> 07:17.050
You white folks throw
a really quiet party.

07:17.421 --> 07:20.606
Yeah, wait till they bring out the
onion dip. All hell breaks loose.

07:20.927 --> 07:22.730
I want you guys
to meet my dad.

07:22.770 --> 07:26.513
This is william barnett. He owns
a chain of record stores.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.433
He's rich.

07:28.602 --> 07:32.670
Jackie, I don't know if I'd say--
ah, what the hell, yeah, I am.

07:32.721 --> 07:36.142
And, W.B., This is bob, who's
also done some work in retail,

07:36.176 --> 07:42.001
and midge, who's also been to...
some stores.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.210
It's true.

07:44.732 --> 07:49.233
Steven, you didn't tell me
your father was so handsome.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.186
Hey, what about me?

07:51.237 --> 07:53.799
Well, you didn't
tell me either.

07:54.979 --> 07:56.917
Okay, hello. Hello.

07:56.951 --> 08:00.558
Let's kick off kitty fest
with a little game.

08:00.888 --> 08:03.467
How about
hide-and-go-to-sleep?

08:03.906 --> 08:05.793
When I blow
this whistle...

08:06.788 --> 08:09.940
pair up with someone and
tell an anecdote about me.

08:09.974 --> 08:11.868
When I blow it again...

08:12.761 --> 08:14.767
pair up with someone
else, and

08:14.817 --> 08:21.218
the person who tells the cutest story will get
a special mention in my christmas newsletter.

08:22.061 --> 08:24.083
That's a prize?

08:25.044 --> 08:28.331
Now since there are
an odd number of people here,

08:28.382 --> 08:32.317
I'm afraid one unlucky person
is going to get left out of the fun.

08:32.351 --> 08:35.333
I'll fall on that grenade.
Good night, everybody.

08:42.431 --> 08:45.290
Okay, you guys, let's see if I have
everything I need for the moon 'n' trench.

08:45.340 --> 08:48.560
Car, check.
Lawn, check.

08:48.947 --> 08:51.341
Creamy white
butt,check.

08:52.167 --> 08:54.072
eric, wait.

08:54.848 --> 08:57.983
If you moon old man shinsky, you're
not gonna have time to pull up your pants.

08:58.017 --> 09:00.360
You can't run back to the car
with them around your ankles.

09:00.410 --> 09:02.754
- You think I shouldn't do it?
- No, hell, no.

09:02.905 --> 09:05.582
I think you should
do it pantsless.

09:05.810 --> 09:09.790
Eric, he's right. I mean, you can
barely run with your pants on.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.810
The pants
come off.

09:12.860 --> 09:16.110
Oh, great. Everybody's on board
when eric wants to take his pants off,

09:16.168 --> 09:19.448
but when I do it, we have
to leave the restaurant.

09:20.194 --> 09:22.166
It's go time.

09:27.138 --> 09:28.655
What's going on here?

09:28.723 --> 09:31.706
That's my butt!
Whoo!

09:32.819 --> 09:34.370
Lock, donna.

09:34.679 --> 09:36.921
Now for the trench.

09:44.935 --> 09:45.963
what--

09:46.014 --> 09:47.834
what's goin' on?
We're not movin'.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.700
Oh, man, you dropped
your transmission.

09:50.751 --> 09:53.633
In english, donna,in english.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.539
Your car no go.

09:56.606 --> 09:59.438
I'm calling
the police!

09:59.877 --> 10:01.680
Wait, I am
the police.

10:01.714 --> 10:04.091
They can't catch me
here. We gotta go.

10:04.124 --> 10:05.967
I gotta stay with the car.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.293
We don't.

10:10.316 --> 10:12.541
Oh, man. Donna,
what are we gonna do?

10:15.129 --> 10:17.168
I love you, eric.

10:17.236 --> 10:19.191
No, don't leave me.

10:19.242 --> 10:21.719
Oh, kelso. Buddy, thanks.
I knew you'd come back.

10:21.753 --> 10:25.794
Oh, I'm not really back. Since you didn't make
me first lieutenant, I'm just here to say,

10:25.827 --> 10:28.103
I got his pants!

10:33.328 --> 10:37.531
you are right, phyllis,
I am a talented mimic.

10:38.357 --> 10:41.678
"hi, I'm johnny carson,
and I'm on tv."

10:42.773 --> 10:45.796
Uh-oh, time to switch.

10:48.628 --> 10:52.067
well, it's you and me.
This should be fun.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.633
So, hum...

10:58.516 --> 11:00.909
you take out the trash.

11:02.477 --> 11:03.404
No.

11:03.449 --> 11:05.337
I gotta do that, then.

11:05.556 --> 11:09.534
Oh, this is terrible. Have we
run out of things to talk about?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.681
Oh, no, no.

11:11.732 --> 11:13.468
Let me see...

11:14.024 --> 11:16.704
I saw a squirrel in
the yard today.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.020
I love that squirrel.
I've been feeding him peanuts

11:21.660 --> 11:26.156
Well, that explains why he
took the poison right out of my hand.

11:30.522 --> 11:34.109
Jackie, I don't know what's going on with me.
I just got paired up with this book keeping guy

11:34.143 --> 11:36.687
who told me a story
about accounts receivable.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.809
Not only did I know
what he was talking about,

11:38.859 --> 11:41.470
I suggested he
make a flowchart.

11:43.712 --> 11:46.993
Oh, my god, you are
so sexy right now.

11:48.558 --> 11:50.835
Say "flowchart" again.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.702
Kitty, kitty,

11:57.735 --> 12:01.535
that was the third whistle, and
midge and W.B. Still haven't switched.

12:01.585 --> 12:05.016
Look at her laughing at him.
He's not even funny.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.771
I haven't once heard
him say,"knock knock."

12:08.039 --> 12:11.052
Okay, wait, I have a
good one. "Knock knock."

12:12.140 --> 12:13.629
Damn it.

12:14.366 --> 12:17.611
I'm not gonna stand for you throwing
yourself at every guy you meet. Midge,

12:17.661 --> 12:18.916
We're goin' home.

12:18.950 --> 12:21.812
Until you're ready to trust me,
I'm not goin' anywhere.

12:21.845 --> 12:24.748
In fact, I'm leaving.

12:26.522 --> 12:27.610
Where are you going?

12:27.665 --> 12:29.423
To  lock myself
in your bathroom.

12:29.456 --> 12:31.147
What's wrong
with your bathroom?

12:31.197 --> 12:36.385
I can't go there. There's too many painful
memories of sexy showers with bob.

12:37.699 --> 12:40.962
See, I told you
people do that.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.308
look,

12:53.459 --> 12:55.417
man, please
don't call my dad.

12:55.484 --> 13:00.691
If he hears about this, he's gonna kill me. And I don't mean
figuratively. He will literally kill mewith his bare hands.

13:00.842 --> 13:02.733
He will kill me
like he has killed

13:02.767 --> 13:04.926
oh-so-many
squirrels.

13:05.545 --> 13:07.570
Settle down.
You're 18.

13:07.604 --> 13:09.160
I'm not gonna
call your dad.

13:14.555 --> 13:16.630
I want my daddy.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.716
Donna.

13:26.750 --> 13:30.212
- They said I could visit you for ten minutes.
- It's good to see a friendly face.

13:30.298 --> 13:32.607
Jail's no place for me, Donna.

13:33.837 --> 13:35.728
I'm too pretty.

13:37.105 --> 13:39.113
Eric, you're gonna be fine.

13:39.163 --> 13:41.506
Plus, I brought something
that you really need.

13:41.573 --> 13:44.117
- Tell me it's pants.
- Ooh,

13:45.623 --> 13:48.708
Crap. I knew I
forgot something.

13:49.477 --> 13:50.867
But...

13:51.067 --> 13:53.092
how do "milk duds" sound?

13:53.210 --> 13:56.272
Kinda like they won't cover
the lower half of my body.

13:57.598 --> 13:59.322
All right,

13:59.355 --> 14:01.012
visiting hours are over.

14:01.062 --> 14:03.774
Fine. He's
cranky anyway.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.329
All right, kelso, awesome,
get me out of here.

14:08.379 --> 14:10.488
Shut up, punk.

14:12.915 --> 14:15.040
You know, around here
we have a saying.

14:15.074 --> 14:18.459
Is it, "everyone down.
Kelso's got a gun"?

14:20.467 --> 14:21.840
No.

14:22.442 --> 14:25.890
It's "kelso gets to be
first lieutenant."

14:26.983 --> 14:29.644
But now, sir,
you are a criminal,

14:29.677 --> 14:35.201
and you will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of my imagination.

14:39.870 --> 14:42.958
Midge? Please come out
so you can talk to bob.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.050
I can't do that, kitty.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.762
You mean you
don't know how?

14:51.393 --> 14:55.748
The lock is on
the doorknob.

14:58.025 --> 15:01.355
No, I mean I'm
not coming out,

15:01.556 --> 15:04.641
but thank you,
I see it now.

15:05.645 --> 15:08.774
- I want to go to sleep.
- Me too.

15:08.825 --> 15:13.817
Well, I wanted one night that was just about
me, and now everything's about midge.

15:13.850 --> 15:17.080
It's not enough that she's got
legs up to here, and the

15:17.130 --> 15:20.444
you-know-what's out
to you-know-where.

15:20.494 --> 15:23.478
Now she's gotta upstage
me on my big night. Well,

15:23.528 --> 15:26.792
you just get over
yourself, lady.

15:28.147 --> 15:30.758
You know, I never thought
I'd be saying this.

15:30.808 --> 15:33.842
But how's about you and
me get a motel room?

15:35.432 --> 15:37.256
I'd like that.

15:43.399 --> 15:46.801
okay, I'm starting to shake off
this whole flowchart thing.

15:47.304 --> 15:49.613
I can't remember
what a flowchart is.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.626
Can't even remember
what I just said.

15:54.032 --> 15:55.304
Hey,

15:55.922 --> 15:58.299
which one of you jerks
put this tie on me?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.730
Steven, focus.
You're a businessman.

16:01.780 --> 16:04.123
You love work and money

16:04.173 --> 16:05.818
and me.

16:05.902 --> 16:07.559
Hold on to that.

16:07.609 --> 16:11.659
Oh, you know what? You're
gonna forget. I'll write it down.

16:11.949 --> 16:13.991
Oh, you guys missed
a glorious trenching.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.337
Eric's tiny butt gleaming
in the moonlight,

16:16.384 --> 16:18.259
shining brighter than
the brightest star.

16:18.309 --> 16:20.736
It was like a Disney movie.

16:21.171 --> 16:22.448
Yeah,

16:22.565 --> 16:24.657
eric's rear end
is white.

16:24.841 --> 16:27.887
I can't even tell
if he's wearing underwear.

16:28.339 --> 16:30.515
Tonight,
in that jail cell,

16:30.582 --> 16:33.687
he's gonna glow like
a little lightning bug.

16:34.239 --> 16:37.536
Forman's in jail, and I spent
my entire night at a cocktail party?

16:37.837 --> 16:40.967
I gotta go break some laws
or I'm never gonna forgive myself.

16:41.620 --> 16:42.672
Hey,

16:42.723 --> 16:44.932
which one of you jerks
put this tie on me?

16:49.903 --> 16:52.352
I know what you're
thinkin', punk.

16:54.008 --> 16:56.536
Is that gun real or fake?

16:56.988 --> 16:59.515
Well, the
gun is green.

16:59.997 --> 17:02.875
But it's also
plastic, so...

17:03.009 --> 17:05.050
it's anyone's guess.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.411
Well...

17:07.846 --> 17:11.461
then you have to ask yourself
one question, punk--

17:11.493 --> 17:15.159
do I like being squirted
with grape juice?

17:15.326 --> 17:17.770
- Well, do you? Yeah?
- Okay, quit it.

17:19.059 --> 17:21.502
- You're gonna be all sticky.
- Thank you.

17:22.210 --> 17:23.800
Okay, Mr. Shinsky,

17:23.851 --> 17:26.553
Once you've identified the culprit,
you can file a formal complaint.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.788
Oh, that's him. I'd recognize that
creamy-assed moron anywhere.

17:31.644 --> 17:33.921
Oh, yeah, he was there, too.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.762
What, me?
No,

17:35.812 --> 17:37.753
no, no, no.

17:37.837 --> 17:39.879
I was undercover,

17:39.912 --> 17:44.406
infiltrating the underworld
trenching world.

17:44.440 --> 17:49.410
And it goes a lot deeper than you might think.
The whole middle school might be involved.

17:49.461 --> 17:51.285
Okay.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.591
In you go, kelso.

17:56.394 --> 17:57.883
Aw, no, you're
putting me in jail?

17:57.934 --> 18:00.645
Maybe a few hours in the can will
give you a new respect for the law.

18:00.678 --> 18:03.500
But that's the
thing, it won't.

18:10.824 --> 18:14.558
I hope midge isn't going
through my medicine cabinet.

18:15.228 --> 18:19.267
I've got some pills in there,
and they are not for amateurs.

18:23.339 --> 18:24.781
What's going on?

18:24.831 --> 18:28.183
Your loony mother has locked
herself in my bathroom.

18:29.021 --> 18:30.445
I'll  handle this.

18:32.566 --> 18:33.806
Mom,

18:33.857 --> 18:36.924
the lock is on
the doorknob.

18:39.756 --> 18:43.762
That's it, midge. Come out now
or I'm kickin' down the door.

18:43.810 --> 18:47.648
If you kick down that door,
you're gonna have to put it back up.

18:48.268 --> 18:51.268
You take the fun out
of everything, red.

18:52.139 --> 18:56.829
Mom, if you won't come out, will
you at least let dad come in there?

19:02.217 --> 19:05.804
how could you think I was
flirting with another man?

19:05.938 --> 19:09.096
maybe I overreacted.
You're a beautiful woman.

19:09.146 --> 19:11.861
So are you, bob.

19:19.668 --> 19:21.931
What the hell are
they doing in there?

19:31.676 --> 19:32.850
All right,

19:32.883 --> 19:39.527
I'm sorry about tonight. You just really hurt my feelings
when you didn't make me first lieutenant on the shinsky job.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.890
I'm sorry, too.

19:42.191 --> 19:47.798
I guess I never realized how seriously you take
imaginary ranks assigned by your friends.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.642
Well, now you know.

20:00.525 --> 20:01.798
Well,

20:01.849 --> 20:03.917
after a long night
of hashing things out,

20:03.951 --> 20:06.448
we all decided that my
parents are better off apart,

20:06.498 --> 20:08.995
so we took my mom
to the airport this morning.

20:09.264 --> 20:11.375
She headed
back to california?

20:11.543 --> 20:13.408
I hope so.

20:14.721 --> 20:17.252
I taped the ticket
to her purse.

20:26.512 --> 20:29.598
You're coming home
in your underwear again?

20:32.062 --> 20:35.146
I'm gonna paint some
damn pants on you.

20:35.783 --> 20:38.464
Okay, but in
my defense,

20:38.515 --> 20:41.923
this time I took off
my pants by choice.

20:43.615 --> 20:45.845
I don't know where
we went wrong with you.

20:46.264 --> 20:50.841
We take you to church, we try to
raise you to be a decent human being,

20:50.875 --> 20:54.914
and yet you turn out to be
a bottomless deviant.

20:57.093 --> 21:00.076
Okay, red, the
shower's running.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.768
You promised.

21:10.790 --> 21:14.588
Stick my eggs in the oven.
I'll be back in five minutes.

21:17.722 --> 21:20.907
Freeze, punk, freeze!

21:26.060 --> 21:27.334
Hi.

21:28.708 --> 21:29.931
What are you in for?

21:29.965 --> 21:34.166
Let's just say old man shinsky's yard
has been professionally trenched.

21:35.138 --> 21:38.373
Did the rose bushes, too.
It's sort of my calling card.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.222
Ah....

21:41.969 --> 21:43.847
This feels good.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.165
This feels right.
