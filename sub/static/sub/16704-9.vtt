00:22.144 --> 00:24.545
Okay.
Burn unit, commence.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.414
You go first.

00:26.482 --> 00:29.300
Oh, I play soccer, 'cause
I forgot I have hands.

00:29.368 --> 00:31.619
Burn! I'm on the news,
because I have a huge head.

00:31.704 --> 00:33.821
Burn!

00:33.906 --> 00:35.707
I can't outrun a lawnmower

00:35.774 --> 00:37.458
'cause my dress is so tight.

00:37.526 --> 00:38.993
Oh! I'm dead.

00:39.061 --> 00:40.061
Burn.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.381
<i>Whoa.
It's Banjo.</i>

00:43.448 --> 00:45.600
Oh, I'm a cowboy, and I got...
Wait, wait, wait.

00:45.668 --> 00:47.669
Suspend burn unit.
This is a great movie.

00:47.736 --> 00:49.370
It's a Spaguetti Western,

00:49.438 --> 00:51.572
the best one, underappreciated.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.007
He plays a Banjo.

00:53.075 --> 00:54.208
Yeah, I can see that.

00:54.276 --> 00:55.643
And they made a
whole bunch of these.

00:55.711 --> 00:57.829
Dad. Do we have anything
bigger than this?

00:57.896 --> 00:59.330
Oh, Gene, what'd you do?

00:59.398 --> 01:01.549
Nothing, yet. Just
planning ahead.

01:01.617 --> 01:03.334
What are you guys watching?

01:03.402 --> 01:04.885
Nothing.
Go back to bed.

01:04.953 --> 01:07.438
The burn unit is just me and dad.

01:08.891 --> 01:11.109
Whoa! Did he just shoot
bullets out of his Banjo?

01:11.176 --> 01:13.077
Yes.
Damn!

01:13.145 --> 01:15.446
Oh, you like that, Gene? 'Cause
we're changing the channel.

01:15.514 --> 01:16.848
No, no. Let's watch it.

01:16.915 --> 01:18.416
This is pretty much
the beginning.

01:18.484 --> 01:20.785
What? What?!
Gene, sit here.

01:20.853 --> 01:24.405
It's like pushing
a couch off the couch!

01:24.473 --> 01:26.424
Yah!

01:26.492 --> 01:27.892
Here.
Hold my plunger.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.327
- Yah!
- Ow!

01:30.562 --> 01:31.462
Oh!

01:31.530 --> 01:33.314
We are just so thrilled

01:33.382 --> 01:35.199
that you chose us
to cater the event.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.834
Mom, mom... fill me up.

01:36.902 --> 01:39.520
I just hope we can live up
to last year's event. Mom.

01:39.588 --> 01:41.372
That Colleen Caviello, mom...

01:41.440 --> 01:42.840
She really outdid herself.

01:42.891 --> 01:44.559
And never lets anyone
forget about it.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.561
Just fill up the little mug.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.730
Ouch.
Right. Right, right.

01:48.814 --> 01:49.781
Okay, Mr. Frond.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.816
Good-bye. Good-bye.

01:51.867 --> 01:53.835
So what are we catering?
That sounded promising.

01:53.902 --> 01:55.870
Oh, it's a real big deal, Bobby.

01:55.938 --> 01:59.240
It's a fund-raiser for Tina's
conflict resolution club.

01:59.324 --> 02:01.492
Colleen Caviello made
the food last year.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.245
This year she can go...
Blow a balloon.

02:04.313 --> 02:06.514
Yay! You're catering
our fund-raiser.

02:06.582 --> 02:08.299
That's great.
How much does it pay?

02:08.366 --> 02:09.500
Nothing.
Nothing?

02:09.550 --> 02:11.736
It's a benefit, Bobby.

02:11.804 --> 02:14.172
It's a spaghetti dinner.
But we don't make spaghetti.

02:14.239 --> 02:17.141
This is school fund-raising,
Bob... it's a pasta game.

02:17.209 --> 02:19.210
You make spaghetti,
or you go home.

02:19.278 --> 02:21.696
Besides, it's for a good cause.

02:21.764 --> 02:23.948
Oh, yeah... to one-up
Colleen Caviello.

02:24.016 --> 02:25.466
That's a, that's a great cause.

02:25.534 --> 02:26.884
You weren't there, Bob!

02:26.935 --> 02:28.319
You don't know how awful it was.

02:29.938 --> 02:32.924
This is delicious.

02:32.991 --> 02:35.493
Oh my God,

02:35.561 --> 02:39.731
I love this ziti.

02:45.754 --> 02:50.675
They love my ziti.

02:52.244 --> 02:55.163
And that was the worst
day of my life.

02:55.230 --> 02:58.916
Anyway, this isn't about
Colleen, this is about Tina.

02:58.984 --> 03:01.402
We're raising money to buy
a bulletproof trash can

03:01.470 --> 03:04.655
so gang members can finally
throw out their guns. Aw.

03:04.723 --> 03:06.424
And we're teaching conflict
resolution skills

03:06.492 --> 03:07.759
you can use in your own lives.

03:07.826 --> 03:09.227
That's right, Tina.

03:09.294 --> 03:10.745
And Mr. Frond is running
the whole thing.

03:10.813 --> 03:12.363
Ugh, Mr. Frond?

03:12.431 --> 03:14.232
He's a tall drink of...
Annoying.

03:14.299 --> 03:16.768
That may be true, but you're
gonna drink that drink, mister.

03:16.835 --> 03:17.852
I don't want to.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.287
I have worked too hard

03:19.354 --> 03:20.471
to get us this event,

03:20.539 --> 03:21.806
so you'll be nice to Frond,

03:21.874 --> 03:23.441
and you'll make spaghetti
and meatballs!

03:23.509 --> 03:24.725
No... no...
Yes... yes!

03:24.793 --> 03:26.494
Fine, but I'm gonna half-ass it.

03:26.562 --> 03:27.628
Yay.

03:27.696 --> 03:28.629
Dad, check it out.

03:28.697 --> 03:30.281
Little princess guitar.

03:30.349 --> 03:31.482
Gene, that's mine!

03:31.550 --> 03:32.617
You never use it.

03:32.684 --> 03:34.001
I'm like Banjo.

03:34.069 --> 03:35.403
What's the bad guy's name?

03:35.471 --> 03:37.789
Ceviche.
Ceviche, yeah.

03:37.856 --> 03:40.641
He reminds me of this kid
at school... Choo-Choo.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.010
Choo-Choo?
Yeah. He's kind of my Nemesis.

03:43.095 --> 03:46.664
If I'm telling a joke, he'll say
the punch line before I do.

03:46.732 --> 03:48.516
A vampire walks
into a bar and says

03:48.600 --> 03:49.784
I'll have a...
I'll have a blood lite.

03:49.852 --> 03:51.002
Huh?

03:51.069 --> 03:52.470
What do you call a Spanish guy

03:52.538 --> 03:53.738
with a rubber toe?

03:53.805 --> 03:55.490
Roberto! Rober...

03:57.292 --> 03:58.776
What kind of bees make milk?

03:58.827 --> 03:59.744
Boo-bees!
Boo-bees!

04:01.013 --> 04:03.447
So, I'm gonna use this guitar

04:03.515 --> 04:06.534
to stand up to Choo-Choo
like Banjo.

04:06.602 --> 04:08.302
That's, uh...
That's great, Gene.

04:08.370 --> 04:09.637
But I think your face is wrong.

04:09.705 --> 04:11.873
My face is wrong?!

04:11.940 --> 04:14.242
Yeah, you should
do the Banjo icy stare.

04:14.309 --> 04:16.410
Like this?

04:16.478 --> 04:18.296
No. Not like that.

04:19.363 --> 04:20.281
No, no, no.

04:20.349 --> 04:21.498
Don't growl. That...

04:21.550 --> 04:23.301
Like this?
Hmm.

04:23.368 --> 04:24.735
Maybe try that.

04:24.803 --> 04:26.454
Is Choo-Choo scared
of stroke victims?

04:26.522 --> 04:27.588
Terrified.

04:30.626 --> 04:31.759
Hey, Gene, Gene.

04:31.827 --> 04:32.927
How do you plead?

04:32.995 --> 04:34.629
I'm innocent.

04:34.696 --> 04:37.331
Your fingerprints
were all over the murder weapon.

04:37.399 --> 04:38.900
I don't have fingers.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.334
Your honor!

04:40.402 --> 04:41.769
I don't have time for this.

04:41.837 --> 04:43.871
What?! You don't have time
for food court?

04:43.939 --> 04:45.339
Where are you going?

04:45.407 --> 04:47.608
Hey. Wanna hear
a good one?

04:48.710 --> 04:50.478
What's green and sings?

04:50.546 --> 04:53.064
Go ahead. Do it.
El...

04:53.131 --> 04:54.916
Ah.

04:54.983 --> 04:56.517
Elvis P...

04:56.585 --> 04:58.419
Elvis Par...

04:58.487 --> 04:59.036
Ah!

04:59.104 --> 05:00.922
Forget it.

05:01.006 --> 05:02.523
I'll tell you
what's green and sings...

05:02.591 --> 05:04.592
Elvis Parsley.

05:06.878 --> 05:10.548
You don't say the punch lines
to other people's jokes anymore.

05:10.616 --> 05:12.383
You got that, Poo-Poo?

05:13.769 --> 05:15.036
What the hell?

05:15.103 --> 05:16.420
Thank you. Thank you.

05:16.488 --> 05:17.838
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

05:17.906 --> 05:19.640
Anyway... Gene, look.

05:19.708 --> 05:20.708
They're about
to announce the verdict.

05:20.776 --> 05:21.976
Guilty.

05:22.044 --> 05:23.344
No!

05:23.412 --> 05:24.996
Take him away.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.048
Gene, where are you going?

05:27.115 --> 05:28.683
What's up with Gene?

05:28.750 --> 05:29.834
I don't know, Lasagna.

05:29.902 --> 05:32.069
I don't know.

05:32.137 --> 05:34.572
You know, cooking spaghetti
isn't even cooking.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.057
It's just, like, boiling water.

05:36.124 --> 05:37.491
Hey, Bobby, can I
come to this thing?

05:37.559 --> 05:38.859
Uh, I don't think so.

05:38.927 --> 05:39.860
Why not? Some
of these moms

05:39.928 --> 05:41.178
are divorced, right?

05:41.246 --> 05:43.397
They meet me, I meet their kids.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.900
Maybe throw the ball around.
Not inside, but...

05:45.968 --> 05:48.469
uh, we agreed no more
school events for you, Teddy.

05:48.537 --> 05:50.171
Hey, dad. Guess what?
What?

05:50.239 --> 05:52.907
I acted like Banjo
and took Choo-Choo down.

05:52.975 --> 05:54.375
Everyone laughed.

05:54.443 --> 05:56.911
Well, one kid laughed.
Peter Pescadero.

05:56.979 --> 05:58.813
He has a learning disability.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.414
Yeah, but he knows what's funny.

06:00.482 --> 06:02.550
Now that you
stood up for yourself...

06:02.618 --> 06:04.402
Oh, congratulations, Gene...

06:04.469 --> 06:06.637
Can we stop talking about it?

06:06.705 --> 06:08.873
Okay, tonight, I propose,

06:08.940 --> 06:13.544
dad, that after everyone else
goes to bed... Gene...

06:13.612 --> 06:16.964
<i>We fire up the burn unit
and we watch Canine Criminals,</i>

06:17.049 --> 06:19.200
and then that stretching show,

06:19.268 --> 06:23.271
<i>and then maybe a little
Beetlejuice in Espa√±ol,</i>

06:23.338 --> 06:24.772
<i>Beetlejugo. Beetlejugo.
Beetlejugo.</i>

06:24.840 --> 06:26.590
Ay, ay, ay, ay!

06:26.658 --> 06:29.927
I would, except a certain
best dad in the world

06:29.995 --> 06:32.163
went out and got this!

06:32.230 --> 06:34.665
<i>It's the complete Banjo box set!</i>

06:34.733 --> 06:38.653
All 12 DVDs and over
28 hours of extras.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.620
Yeah!

06:39.688 --> 06:41.589
28 hours?!

06:41.657 --> 06:43.858
Dad, can I... see that
fork for a minute?

06:43.925 --> 06:45.059
Um... here.

06:45.127 --> 06:46.694
Thank you.
And I just want to...

06:48.814 --> 06:50.665
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!

06:50.732 --> 06:51.832
No!

06:56.313 --> 06:57.897
Best part right here, Gene.

06:57.964 --> 06:59.632
There's only gonna be two shots,

06:59.700 --> 07:01.217
me shooting you,

07:01.284 --> 07:03.019
and then me drinking
this shot of whiskey.

07:04.287 --> 07:07.173
Wow.
Oh, what a line.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.275
Go ahead,
watch your stupid movie.

07:09.342 --> 07:12.244
There are other people for me
to hang out with around here.

07:12.312 --> 07:14.747
Tina, get up.
Let's hang out.

07:14.815 --> 07:17.717
Okay. Maybe we can
practice conflict resolution.

07:17.784 --> 07:20.219
Say something mean to me
so I can not react.

07:20.287 --> 07:21.287
Anything I want?

07:21.354 --> 07:23.389
Yeah.
Ha-ha!

07:23.457 --> 07:25.925
Well, uh, your room looks
like it was decorated

07:25.992 --> 07:27.693
by a perverted jockey.

07:27.761 --> 07:29.962
When you say that, what I feel

07:30.030 --> 07:31.897
is that you're trying
to hurt my feelings.

07:31.965 --> 07:34.166
Oh, my God.
Why do you talk so...

07:34.234 --> 07:37.219
Slow?
When you say that, what I feel

07:37.287 --> 07:39.321
is that you're trying to hurt...
Oh man, Tina.

07:39.389 --> 07:42.024
This is really, really boring.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.159
Okay, well...

07:43.226 --> 07:44.794
Hey, mom, you want to hang out?

07:44.861 --> 07:47.663
Oh, I'd love that!

07:47.731 --> 07:50.800
Oh, mother-daughter
bonding time.

07:50.867 --> 07:52.802
Just like me and my mother.

07:52.869 --> 07:54.854
Ooh! Makeover!

07:54.921 --> 07:57.106
Hmm...

07:59.126 --> 08:01.243
Okay, my little cowpokes.

08:01.311 --> 08:02.711
Time for school.

08:02.779 --> 08:04.613
You can watch the rest tonight.
Mom!

08:04.681 --> 08:05.748
How could you?

08:05.816 --> 08:06.782
How could I what?

08:06.850 --> 08:08.434
How could you encourage this?

08:08.502 --> 08:10.336
Oh, Louise, don't be a pill.

08:10.403 --> 08:12.154
A little father-son bonding
is going on here

08:12.222 --> 08:13.656
and that's a good thing.

08:13.723 --> 08:15.641
These two don't
always do it so well.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.526
Tambourine solo!

08:18.929 --> 08:20.196
Sheesh.

08:25.352 --> 08:26.986
All right, this is how
you throw a spiral.

08:27.053 --> 08:28.370
You ready?
Here comes a bullet.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.738
Hmm.

08:29.806 --> 08:31.006
Oh, stupid ball!

08:31.074 --> 08:32.256
It's 'cause there's no laces.

08:32.308 --> 08:33.793
I'm hungry.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.193
All right, we're done.
Go inside.

08:35.261 --> 08:37.229
I want peanut butter!

08:37.297 --> 08:40.265
It turns out we bond
better over movies

08:40.332 --> 08:42.668
that I like to watch,
that I make Gene watch.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.068
Yeah.

08:44.136 --> 08:46.005
Oh, that's...
That's adorable.

08:46.072 --> 08:47.473
I'm going to school.

08:47.541 --> 08:49.041
Good.
Great.

08:49.109 --> 08:50.860
Why don't you learn something
and become a lawyer.

08:52.262 --> 08:55.080
Abs: The conflict
resolution program

08:55.148 --> 08:56.649
sweeping our school.

08:56.716 --> 08:58.017
You all know my system,

08:58.084 --> 08:59.451
and at the spaghetti dinner,

08:59.519 --> 09:01.353
so will your parents
or legal guardians,

09:01.421 --> 09:03.789
um, Becky,
'cause your mom's in jail.

09:03.857 --> 09:06.408
Tina, Jocelyn, Jimmy junior...
let's rehearse.

09:06.476 --> 09:08.210
Becky, you just watch.

09:08.278 --> 09:10.830
Tina here just found out
that her best friend Jocelyn

09:10.897 --> 09:14.033
told Jimmy junior
that Tina, is "whack."

09:14.100 --> 09:16.468
And... acting.

09:16.536 --> 09:19.205
Tina, Jocelyn
told me you are whack.

09:19.272 --> 09:21.240
Jocelyn, you skank.
I hate you.

09:21.308 --> 09:23.309
Whatever. It's true.

09:23.376 --> 09:24.810
You are whack.

09:26.947 --> 09:29.582
And... freeze!

09:29.649 --> 09:32.751
Well, that resolved nothing.

09:32.819 --> 09:35.154
Let's rewind, shall we?

09:38.425 --> 09:41.460
Let's work out
our abs. A!

09:41.528 --> 09:43.095
Access your feelings!

09:43.163 --> 09:45.698
When you gossiped about
me to Jimmy junior,

09:45.765 --> 09:47.199
it hurt my feelings.

09:47.267 --> 09:49.235
B: Be apologetic!

09:49.302 --> 09:50.402
Sorry.

09:50.470 --> 09:52.004
S: Slap it!

09:52.072 --> 09:54.139
Well done.
Do it just like that

09:54.207 --> 09:55.140
at the dinner.

09:55.208 --> 09:58.761
Oh, enjoy your lunch, everyone.

09:58.828 --> 10:01.897
If you ever gossip about me
to Jimmy junior outside

10:01.965 --> 10:04.500
of a conflict resolution skit,
I'll punch you in the face.

10:04.568 --> 10:06.835
It was just a skit, Tina.

10:06.903 --> 10:08.270
I will punch you.

10:08.338 --> 10:11.824
Again and again,
and again and again...

10:11.875 --> 10:13.192
My God, what a psycho.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.895
And again and again...

10:15.962 --> 10:17.763
And again and again and...

10:19.232 --> 10:20.332
Well, the important thing is,

10:20.400 --> 10:22.101
I shared this movie with Gene

10:22.168 --> 10:23.869
and it helped him stand up
for himself at school.

10:23.937 --> 10:26.922
Eh, I beat up a lot of kids
like Gene when I was his age.

10:27.007 --> 10:29.775
Not that I was a bully...
just kids like Gene, you know?

10:29.843 --> 10:31.210
That get beat up.

10:31.278 --> 10:33.212
Bob, how are
the meatballs comin'?

10:33.280 --> 10:34.947
Because they need to be perfect.

10:35.015 --> 10:38.167
Hey, it's just like your
burgers, only spherical!

10:38.235 --> 10:39.101
Hey!
Hey, what?

10:39.169 --> 10:40.886
They're not for you.

10:40.954 --> 10:42.838
They're for me to show off
in front of the other moms

10:42.906 --> 10:43.906
at the fund-raiser.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.541
Bobby, make one extra-big

10:45.609 --> 10:48.244
for Colleen Caviello to choke on.

10:48.311 --> 10:49.378
Okay.

10:51.047 --> 10:53.449
All right, looks like
I'm sitting with you today.

10:53.516 --> 10:56.669
Me, then either of you.

10:56.736 --> 10:58.537
Which sticker do you like better,

10:58.605 --> 11:01.757
my purple ladybug
or Susie's red one?

11:01.825 --> 11:03.058
And good-bye.

11:04.711 --> 11:07.012
Hey there,
Spew-Spew.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.380
Funny seeing you here.

11:08.448 --> 11:10.649
In the cafeteria during lunch?

11:10.717 --> 11:12.501
Yeah.

11:12.569 --> 11:14.103
Why do you keep doing that?

11:14.170 --> 11:15.304
Keep doing what?

11:16.439 --> 11:17.873
You're weird!

11:17.941 --> 11:19.992
Weird? I think you mean
anti-hero.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.360
Look at the hat.

11:21.428 --> 11:23.312
It's mom's sun hat, you dork.

11:24.731 --> 11:27.466
You like finishing my jokes.

11:27.534 --> 11:29.585
Well, finish my food.

11:29.653 --> 11:33.088
Gene, you are being
a class act jerk.

11:33.156 --> 11:35.958
This is all about jokes
from your stupid joke book.

11:36.026 --> 11:39.128
<i>You've insulted Jokes for
Blokes for the last time.</i>

11:40.747 --> 11:43.132
Oh, don't you even
think about it, Gene.

11:52.309 --> 11:53.809
Food fight!

12:00.233 --> 12:03.869
No...!

12:06.990 --> 12:09.274
And these two, Bob, were
throwing at each other.

12:09.342 --> 12:10.259
I hate you.

12:10.327 --> 12:11.310
I hate you.

12:11.378 --> 12:13.712
They seem to be in conflict.

12:13.780 --> 12:16.148
I'm sure we can,
uh, work through it.

12:16.216 --> 12:19.101
I'd like you to take
a look at my abs.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.170
Um, no thank you.

12:21.237 --> 12:23.188
Show him your abs, Mr. Frond.

12:23.256 --> 12:24.873
We'd all like to see your abs.
Okay.

12:24.941 --> 12:26.008
I really don't.

12:26.076 --> 12:26.975
And your ding-dong.
Gene.

12:27.043 --> 12:29.311
Gene, why don't you access

12:29.379 --> 12:32.281
how it makes you feel
that Louise is angry with you.

12:32.349 --> 12:33.332
Fine.

12:34.384 --> 12:35.984
That's all I'm gonna say.

12:36.052 --> 12:37.503
Well, this is all I'm gonna say.

12:37.570 --> 12:38.554
Hi-yah!

12:39.706 --> 12:41.340
Let go of my...

12:41.408 --> 12:43.459
H-hey.
L-Louise, Louise, Louise.

12:43.526 --> 12:45.644
You're not using your abs.

12:45.695 --> 12:47.262
Um, this is dumb.

12:47.330 --> 12:49.131
Bo... Bob.
Yes.

12:49.199 --> 12:51.100
When you say "this is dumb,"

12:51.167 --> 12:55.320
it makes me feel like
pinching you in the eye.

12:55.388 --> 12:57.072
Why did you do that?

12:57.157 --> 12:58.407
So we can resolve this

12:58.475 --> 13:01.060
and set a good example
for your children.

13:01.127 --> 13:02.294
Okay.

13:02.362 --> 13:03.929
I will now kick you in the shin.

13:04.964 --> 13:06.331
Okay. Okay.

13:06.399 --> 13:07.950
All right.

13:08.017 --> 13:09.284
Hey!

13:09.352 --> 13:11.036
Don't throw
repressed memory Emily!

13:11.104 --> 13:12.571
She won't remember this.

13:12.639 --> 13:14.239
Well, this is really
working out, Mr. Frond.

13:14.307 --> 13:16.075
Your system is amazing.

13:16.142 --> 13:17.976
Ho. No, no, no, no, no.
We're gonna go.

13:18.044 --> 13:20.012
You know what I forgot to say?

13:20.080 --> 13:21.947
Detention! Detention!

13:22.015 --> 13:22.681
And you,

13:22.749 --> 13:24.550
I am gonna cut you!

13:24.617 --> 13:26.402
I am gonna cut you out of

13:26.469 --> 13:28.270
the conflict resolution
spaghetti dinner!

13:28.354 --> 13:30.089
Wha... oh, come on, you can't...

13:30.156 --> 13:32.825
Too late! The conflict
resolution spaghetti dinner

13:32.892 --> 13:35.761
will now be
a conflict resolution fast.

13:35.829 --> 13:37.563
Well, that didn't go so well.

13:37.630 --> 13:39.031
Mm-mm.

13:39.099 --> 13:40.432
Yeah, he seemed angry.
Frothy.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.334
And kind of bloated, right?

13:42.402 --> 13:44.169
Mm.
Maybe he's dehydrated.

13:44.237 --> 13:45.737
Your mother's gonna kill me.

13:45.805 --> 13:48.240
So glad we had
a chance to talk this out!

13:49.542 --> 13:50.609
Emily, I'm sorry!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.116
Detention?!
And we're banned from

13:56.201 --> 13:57.501
catering the peace club dinner!

13:57.569 --> 13:59.203
Bobby!
I'm sorry, Lin, I...

13:59.270 --> 14:00.871
I can't even tell you

14:00.939 --> 14:03.307
how many favors I had to
call in to cater that thing.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.408
How many?

14:04.476 --> 14:06.143
Two!
Tina, you're supposed

14:06.211 --> 14:07.878
to be watching the restaurant.

14:07.946 --> 14:09.646
I'm too upset to serve food.

14:09.714 --> 14:11.415
W-what'd you do?
Did you lock up?

14:11.483 --> 14:13.384
Yes.
Were there customers inside?

14:13.451 --> 14:14.485
I don't know.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.820
No one's gonna come

14:16.888 --> 14:17.888
to the fund-raiser now.

14:17.956 --> 14:19.189
Good job, Bobby!

14:19.257 --> 14:20.457
It's not my fault, Lin.

14:20.525 --> 14:21.625
It was
Mr. Frond's fault.

14:21.693 --> 14:23.644
And Louise's.
And Gene's!

14:23.712 --> 14:26.330
And most of all,
that stupid movie.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.898
Hey!
Hey, don't blame the movie.

14:27.966 --> 14:29.333
All right.
Leave bingo out of this!

14:29.401 --> 14:30.267
Shut up!

14:30.335 --> 14:31.468
All of you!

14:31.536 --> 14:32.870
I'm locking these movies

14:32.937 --> 14:33.987
in my jewelry drawer.

14:34.055 --> 14:34.905
Aw, come on.
Unfair!

14:34.973 --> 14:35.973
'Bout time.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.274
You're overreacting, Lin.

14:37.342 --> 14:38.492
The hell I am!

14:38.560 --> 14:40.411
I'm in charge of
a spaghetti dinner

14:40.478 --> 14:42.296
that's not gonna have
any spaghetti!

14:42.364 --> 14:43.831
If we all just
worked on our abs...

14:43.915 --> 14:45.499
Not now with that crap, Tina!

15:01.149 --> 15:03.250
I can't believe I got detention.

15:03.318 --> 15:04.685
I can't believe I got detention.

15:04.769 --> 15:07.004
If I were you,
I would teach Gene a lesson

15:07.072 --> 15:08.155
he'll never forget.

15:08.239 --> 15:11.275
I had a perfect record.

15:11.342 --> 15:13.310
And then you tainted it.
Taint.

15:13.378 --> 15:15.412
Looks like you got Choo-Choo
right where you want him.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.147
Just give him that icy stare

15:17.215 --> 15:19.516
with some little princess
and finish him.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.452
You want a little of this?

15:23.455 --> 15:25.339
Oh. Oh, yeah, he wants it.

15:25.407 --> 15:26.874
Now give him the icy stare.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.610
Put him in his place.

15:29.677 --> 15:31.178
You're dead!

15:31.262 --> 15:33.130
Quiet!

15:33.198 --> 15:34.631
‚ô™ Sexual, sexual ‚ô™

15:37.535 --> 15:38.469
Okay, well, I'm gonna go get

15:38.536 --> 15:39.903
Gene and Louise from detention.

15:39.971 --> 15:42.072
Great! Bring some meatballs.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.373
Got plenty of meatballs.

15:43.441 --> 15:45.509
All dressed up and nowhere to go.

15:45.577 --> 15:46.910
Mmm.

15:46.978 --> 15:48.679
Meatball. Mmm.

15:48.746 --> 15:49.646
All right.

15:49.714 --> 15:51.281
I'm gonna leave.

15:53.318 --> 15:55.586
Gene, this happens now!

15:55.653 --> 15:58.655
Uh, how are we doing this?

15:58.723 --> 15:59.957
Staring contest?

16:01.426 --> 16:02.326
Joke-off?

16:02.393 --> 16:03.560
Kick his ass,
Choo-Choo!

16:05.547 --> 16:08.098
Why are their shirts off?
Oh, boy.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.583
I didn't want to do this.

16:09.651 --> 16:11.285
I haven't even pressed
the blue button yet.

16:11.352 --> 16:12.653
I don't even know what sound...

16:14.539 --> 16:16.206
Fight! Fight!
Fight...! Stop.

16:16.274 --> 16:18.525
There's not gonna be a fight.
Oh, thank God.

16:18.593 --> 16:21.128
Let me go!
This train is off the tracks.

16:21.196 --> 16:23.347
Choo-Choo!

16:23.414 --> 16:25.716
Oh, I get the name now.

16:25.783 --> 16:28.185
I always thought
it was 'cause of how he chewed.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.453
'Cause he chews like a train.

16:29.521 --> 16:30.387
Hey, calm down.

16:33.508 --> 16:34.875
Let's go home, Gene.

16:34.943 --> 16:36.527
You touching my kid?
Sorry. What?

16:36.578 --> 16:38.061
I said, you touching my kid?

16:38.129 --> 16:40.080
Oh, he was attacking my kid.

16:40.148 --> 16:41.331
Oh, yeah? Good.

16:41.399 --> 16:43.066
What is going on with the shirts?

16:43.134 --> 16:44.334
I'm gonna beat your ass so bad

16:44.402 --> 16:46.170
I can skip the gym tonight.

16:46.237 --> 16:47.337
- Dad, this is bad.
- Fight! Fight!

16:47.405 --> 16:48.372
Thank you, Louise.
Fight! Fight...!

16:48.439 --> 16:49.339
I have it under control.

16:49.407 --> 16:50.774
This happens now!

16:50.842 --> 16:52.025
Kill him!

16:53.344 --> 16:55.012
Run!
I can't.

16:55.079 --> 16:57.097
I've got this friggin'
guitar around my neck!

16:57.182 --> 16:59.299
Ha!

17:10.513 --> 17:12.531
Oh, Gene, push down.
I'm trying.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.099
- All right.
- Ow.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.801
All right, just so we're clear,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.336
we're not hiding from those guys.
We're respectfully

17:17.404 --> 17:19.806
declining their invitation
for a fight, okay?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.324
Right.
No, thank you.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.358
I would absolutely
get into a fight

17:23.426 --> 17:25.595
under the right
circumstances, if...

17:25.662 --> 17:27.780
What's that smell?

17:27.848 --> 17:29.882
Oh, Gene!
Gene!

17:29.950 --> 17:32.268
I'm sorry! Hey, shh, shh.
I hear them.

17:32.336 --> 17:34.137
They're coming.

17:34.204 --> 17:35.638
Real...?
You-you hear them?

17:35.706 --> 17:38.307
Gotcha.
Louise, enough.

17:38.375 --> 17:39.625
You've been stirring the pot

17:39.693 --> 17:41.160
for three days,
and acting like a baby.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.261
Now you owe your brother
an apology

17:42.329 --> 17:43.379
for getting him in trouble.

17:43.447 --> 17:44.914
Me?!

17:44.982 --> 17:46.449
Both of you owe me an apology.

17:46.517 --> 17:47.850
Both of us? Why?

17:47.918 --> 17:49.602
<i>Because we wanted to watch Banjo?</i>

17:49.670 --> 17:52.338
Because you stopped
hanging out with me.

17:52.406 --> 17:55.274
What? Shh.
Use your slide voices.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.910
First, the burn unit
stopped hanging out.

17:57.978 --> 18:00.646
Then, the lunch bunch
stopped hanging out.

18:00.714 --> 18:02.198
God, we have lame names.

18:02.266 --> 18:03.749
Who the hell am
I gonna hang around,

18:03.817 --> 18:05.418
if not you two?

18:05.486 --> 18:08.321
Mom and Tina... the
menstruation nation?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.156
Ugh! That's a really
bad name.

18:10.224 --> 18:11.791
You're all I've got.

18:11.859 --> 18:13.359
Louise, I'm sorry.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.127
Me, too. Don't cry.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.496
Ha! Got you.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.965
You thought I was really crying.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.566
Gross.

18:20.634 --> 18:22.335
Gene, stop.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.803
Oh, my God.

18:23.871 --> 18:25.872
I can't help it.
It's anxiety.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.406
And turkey jerky.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.575
It's so incredible.

18:29.643 --> 18:31.811
Your farts smell like mine.
Really?

18:31.879 --> 18:33.513
Oh, great. Are you
guys bonding again?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.681
I'm sorry, but that's
a huge discovery.

18:35.749 --> 18:37.517
A fart is like a fingerprint,

18:37.584 --> 18:39.118
and we have the
same fingerprints.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.686
High-five.

18:40.754 --> 18:42.388
Ugh! Put your hand up.
All right.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.790
I swear my farts smell
like your farts, dad.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.526
I don't think so, Louise.
Oh, wait.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:48.028 --> 18:49.662
Huh?

18:49.730 --> 18:52.131
No. That smells
like your mom's.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.666
No!

18:53.734 --> 18:55.501
Oh, your mom.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.537
What are we gonna do
about mom and Tina?

18:57.604 --> 18:58.938
They could live in here with us!

18:59.006 --> 19:00.439
I think I know a better way.

19:04.378 --> 19:06.395
I'm starving.
How embarrassing.

19:06.463 --> 19:07.980
Guess people will be talking

19:08.065 --> 19:10.366
about my baked ziti
for another year.

19:10.434 --> 19:11.817
Guess people will be talking

19:11.885 --> 19:13.703
about my baked ziti
for another year.

19:13.770 --> 19:15.271
Oh, Linda, I didn't see you.

19:15.339 --> 19:16.872
Hi, Coll.
How are you?

19:22.979 --> 19:25.898
Uh...

19:25.966 --> 19:27.800
Thank you.

19:27.868 --> 19:31.304
Tonight, with your help,
we raised over $100.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.205
It was $110.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.174
I warned you, skank!

19:37.628 --> 19:40.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Girls, please.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.514
It's not time for the skit.

19:41.582 --> 19:42.715
This isn't a skit. It's...

19:42.783 --> 19:43.816
This is real life.

19:43.884 --> 19:45.484
Last year,

19:45.552 --> 19:47.653
the only fighting was to
get seconds on my ziti!

19:47.721 --> 19:49.455
Okay, that's it, Colleen.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.207
Let me tell you about that ziti.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.644
That sauce was store-bought,
and you know it.

19:55.545 --> 19:56.746
Ladies, please!

20:06.923 --> 20:08.608
I thought I told you, Bob.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.142
You and your spaghetti
aren't welcome here.

20:13.747 --> 20:14.947
But I want to say something.

20:15.015 --> 20:16.582
No, thank you.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.517
I've had enough
of your hurt speech.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.869
Would it make
a difference if I...

20:19.936 --> 20:21.971
Worked on my abs?

20:22.039 --> 20:22.972
Oh.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.541
I want to... a...

20:25.609 --> 20:26.942
What was a again?

20:27.010 --> 20:29.228
Anus.
Amyl nitrate.

20:29.313 --> 20:31.330
- Access... I want to access my feelings.
- Mm.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.666
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
enough, enough, enough, enough.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.518
Everyone's about
to kill each other here.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.103
Let's... let's eat!

20:37.170 --> 20:39.572
All right!

20:39.656 --> 20:41.590
Meatballs! Meatballs!

20:41.658 --> 20:42.958
Get your meatballs here.

20:43.026 --> 20:44.527
And spaghetti.

20:54.154 --> 20:58.190
Here, Colleen, why don't you
put these balls in your face?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.730
- Food fight!
- No, no, no...!
