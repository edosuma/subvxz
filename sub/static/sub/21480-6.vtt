00:39.278 --> 00:40.359
We are not a threat

00:40.361 --> 00:41.723
we are salvation

00:41.836 --> 00:44.243
the worid will have to deal with us

00:46.000 --> 00:48.265
Previously on the 4400...

00:48.300 --> 00:50.465
you know those visions that maia used to have?

00:50.500 --> 00:53.000
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.

00:53.035 --> 00:53.965
How long have you known?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.800
Not long.
I only found out because I read her diary.

00:56.835 --> 00:58.700
You're one of those 4400 guys. Huh?

00:58.735 --> 00:59.665
One day.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.950
All of this will be yours.

01:00.985 --> 01:02.200
But you're not going anywhere.

01:02.235 --> 01:04.165
Whatever you do. Shawn.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.300
Don't reveal your healing ability.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.950
Because if you heal one of them.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.400
You'll have to heal them all.

01:09.435 --> 01:10.400
I'm blacking out.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.165
If you're losing chunks of time.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.565
You should talk to your dad about it.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.200
What's he going to do.
Turn me over to ntac medical?

01:16.400 --> 01:17.500
Can I help you?

01:17.600 --> 01:18.700
Heidi. It's mommy.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.900
Who?

01:20.100 --> 01:21.700
That's okay. Sweetie. I got it.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.400
She's my daughter.

01:23.435 --> 01:24.465
She doesn't know that.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.150
She thinks carol is her mother.

01:26.185 --> 01:27.892
Brian. Iook. I need your help.

01:27.927 --> 01:29.565
Richard. He's been arrested.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.100
Okay. I'll make a few calls and do whatever I can.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.165
Hello. Richard.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.500
I want you to come home.

01:34.535 --> 01:35.465
If I'm lying.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.300
Isabelle will punish me accordingly.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.765
If isabelle accepts me.

01:39.800 --> 01:44.200
Well. Then I can offer you and lily and the child a new life.

01:44.235 --> 01:46.000
Let her judge me.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.400
Hush-a-bye.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.700
Hush-a-bye

01:55.500 --> 01:59.600
go to sleep little baby

02:00.600 --> 02:05.100
when you wake I'll give you cake

02:05.135 --> 02:09.600
and all the pretty little horses

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
and go to sleep-y little baby

02:17.200 --> 02:18.965
who's a special girl?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.600
Is isabelle a special girl? Is she?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.100
Come here.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.165
Look at him with isabelle.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.600
This keeps up.
We're going to have to start calling him "uncle jordan.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.500
"There's something so wrong about that.
Isn't there?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.600
A week ago.
He was the one guy we were trying to keep away from her.

02:34.635 --> 02:37.000
- And now it's like...
- they've bonded.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.800
She's really taken to him.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.700
Is that the couple of the hour?

02:43.735 --> 02:44.665
Hi.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.400
Richard. What's up. Man?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.900
It's good to see you.

02:49.700 --> 02:53.300
Look at you. Oh.
You look great. You look great.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.800
So how long do you guys think you're going to be staying?

02:57.400 --> 02:58.800
We're not sure.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.000
Collier said we could stay at the center
till we get back on our feet.

03:02.035 --> 03:03.600
Did he get you squared away with ntac?

03:03.635 --> 03:04.665
Started to.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.265
His lawyers took our statements.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.000
I guess we're looking at back fines for not reporting in.

03:09.035 --> 03:11.365
Well. Hey.
I'm sure jordan will take care of it.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.600
He offered to.
But I think we're going to try and swing it ourselves.

03:14.635 --> 03:16.367
Well. Hey. You picked the right week to come.

03:16.402 --> 03:18.065
This reunion thing's going to be big. Huh?

03:18.100 --> 03:22.100
We've got 4400s coming in from 27 different countries.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.465
Three more maybes.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.400
There haven't been this many of us in
the same place since quarantine.

03:26.435 --> 03:27.865
What's happened since we left town?

03:27.900 --> 03:31.700
I mean. Suddenly it seems like
everyone's dying to meet a real. Live 4400.

03:31.735 --> 03:34.300
Yeah. Well. What happened? Jordan happened.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.300
Welcome to the revolution. Little lady. Huh?

03:46.800 --> 03:49.900
He's going to die! I saw it.
He's going to die.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.600
Sweetheart. Are you okay?

03:51.635 --> 03:53.165
Did you have a nightmare?

03:53.200 --> 03:56.300
No. I was awake. And I saw it.

03:56.335 --> 03:57.165
Tell us what you saw.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.300
That man we watched on tv once.

03:59.335 --> 04:00.600
What man?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.100
Him.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.600
Jordan collier?

04:13.300 --> 04:15.600
Someone's going to kill him.

04:28.804 --> 04:33.834
<i>So long ago, another life</i>

04:33.922 --> 04:37.822
<i>I can feel your heart beat</i>

04:38.304 --> 04:43.160
<i>it's not a dream remember us</i>

04:43.529 --> 04:47.416
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

04:47.424 --> 04:50.928
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

04:50.939 --> 04:55.556
<i>our place in time beyond the sun</i>

04:56.566 --> 05:00.461
<i>we'll find our place in time</i>

05:00.473 --> 05:05.527
<i>our place in time to call our own</i>

05:23.200 --> 05:25.050
As far as this department knew.

05:25.085 --> 05:26.900
Maia wasn't having visions anymore.

05:27.100 --> 05:27.865
Right?

05:27.900 --> 05:29.700
Well. She was keeping them secret from me

05:29.735 --> 05:31.717
and writing everything down in a diary.

05:31.752 --> 05:33.700
But I'm not here to talk about my daughter.

05:33.735 --> 05:35.200
We're here to talk about collier.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.300
We could talk about him all you want.

05:37.335 --> 05:38.065
But if I was collier.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.869
I'd be bringing all my books back to the library.

05:39.870 --> 05:40.805
If you know what i'm mean.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.400
The kid's never wrong. Right?

05:42.700 --> 05:44.450
Look. As far as I can tell.

05:44.485 --> 05:46.165
Maia has two kinds of visions.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.600
If she can see an event clearly enough in her head.

05:48.635 --> 05:51.000
She can sometimes influence the course of the future.

05:51.035 --> 05:53.600
But mostly her visions are abstract.

05:53.635 --> 05:54.700
They're more like...

05:55.100 --> 05:56.365
certainties.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.800
Prophecies.
I guess you could call them.

05:58.835 --> 06:00.367
Now. This is one of those.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.900
And as far as I can tell.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.750
They're never wrong.

06:03.785 --> 06:05.000
Well. Not yet. Anyway.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.400
But nobody's made a concerted effort
to stop one of them from happening.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.900
So we could always offer collier a suite in the basement.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.265
24-hour surveillance. And a food taster.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.100
Sure. We just tell the guy
he needs to stay isolated for what.

06:16.135 --> 06:16.867
A week?

06:16.902 --> 06:17.565
A year?

06:17.600 --> 06:20.265
When it comes to the prevention of future crime.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.400
There are no time limits... and everyone's a suspect.

06:22.435 --> 06:24.365
I mean. Literally everyone.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.100
So how to stop the inevitable from happening?

06:26.135 --> 06:27.165
Stopping the inevitable...

06:27.200 --> 06:28.565
isn't that what we deal with every day?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.200
I mean. That's why the 4400 were sent back. Right?

06:31.500 --> 06:33.200
I like the "can-do" attitude.

06:33.235 --> 06:34.665
But I have to ask...

06:34.700 --> 06:36.650
do we even want to save collier?

06:36.685 --> 06:38.565
Well. He is kind of the bad guy.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.065
Maybe that's the way the future wants it.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.500
Unless they gave us this message as a way 
to stop collier's death from happening.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.565
Fascinating.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.065
What an extraordinary gift.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.900
You are clear on what we're telling you?

06:49.700 --> 06:50.865
Your daughter

06:50.900 --> 06:53.800
has quite a track record when it comes to seeing the future.

06:53.835 --> 06:56.700
Her latest visión involves my death.
I leave anything out?

06:57.400 --> 06:58.865
No. That about covers it.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.165
Ntac is offering you all its resources.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.500
That means round-the-clock protection. Threat assessment

07:03.535 --> 07:06.000
and I'm meant. Of course. To isolate myself?

07:06.035 --> 07:08.100
Well. That would be the safest move.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.665
Let's say I'm willing to assume good faith on your part... which.

07:11.700 --> 07:15.600
Given your exploitation of the 4400 to get to me.
Is rather generous...

07:15.635 --> 07:17.467
what. You think we made this up?

07:17.502 --> 07:19.265
I'm not sure you're that creative.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.900
But your plan does call for my total 
withdrawal from the public eye

07:22.935 --> 07:25.400
and cancellation of a celebration of the public interest

07:25.435 --> 07:28.200
in the 4400 that's been months in the planning.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.800
Our history with each other is what it is.

07:30.835 --> 07:32.100
But this is real.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.600
And denial is not a luxury you can afford.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.900
Thank you for the information.
I'll keep it in mind.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.700
Maia is never wrong.

07:41.900 --> 07:45.100
Whatever protection you can afford me.
I can afford myself.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.300
Pick up some of the reunion literature on your way out.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
The foreign returnees' stories are particularly inspirational.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.700
Still come here every thursday. Huh?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.900
Thought I might get lucky.

08:17.800 --> 08:18.700
Lily.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.100
What are you doing here?

08:21.135 --> 08:22.600
I'm back in seattle.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.150
I just wanted to thank you for helping richard.

08:25.185 --> 08:27.200
Just a couple of phone calls.
It was no big deal.

08:27.235 --> 08:28.465
We were in a bad spot.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.400
You did what you could. It meant a lot.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Well. You really didn't have to get me anything.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.650
It's actually for heidi.

08:34.684 --> 08:35.900
Her birthday's coming up.

08:35.934 --> 08:36.565
Oh. Lily...

08:36.600 --> 08:38.465
it's just a cool little handbag.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.299
You don't have to tell her it's from me.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.400
I don't want to mess with your life. Brian.

08:45.435 --> 08:47.200
I'm just trying to say "thank you."

08:47.700 --> 08:49.700
Okay.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.465
You're looking well. Lily.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.900
I'm glad things are working out.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.965
I can't talk to first keys today.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.500
There's too much going on with this party.

08:59.535 --> 09:01.000
But class starts in 10 minutes.

09:01.035 --> 09:02.300
I can't do it. Lucy.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.400
You're just going to have to tell them 
to think of it as a study hall.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.900
Um... this is outgoing. Thank you.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.700
You guys come for the tour?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.600
Could we talk to you outside?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.200
Kind of a bad day.
It's pretty crazy around here.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.200
Told you he'd blow us off.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.400
What's up?

09:28.600 --> 09:29.800
Oh. Liv.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.900
They were too embarrassed to come inside.

09:31.935 --> 09:33.165
I can'T. I can'T.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.300
But I saw what you can do.

09:34.335 --> 09:35.565
We all did.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.665
You can heal people.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.500
Listen. It's not that simple.
I can't heal everyone.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.200
I'm not asking you to heal everyone.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.665
Just them.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.800
You don't understand. It's like it drains me.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.700
I can do it for maybe one. Maybe.

09:47.735 --> 09:48.865
One is better than none.

09:48.900 --> 09:52.700
And who chooses that one. Way? You? Me?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.700
I can't heal the worid. I'm sorry.

09:57.735 --> 09:58.500
What'd I tell you?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.600
Waste of time...

10:05.200 --> 10:06.500
don't look at me like that.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.200
Kyle?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.900
Hey. You with us. Buddy?

10:17.400 --> 10:18.700
What?

10:19.700 --> 10:21.100
I thought you were...

10:21.200 --> 10:22.500
you know. Elsewhere.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.100
No. I'm right here with you.
Was just thinking. Relax.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.300
I haven't had one of those blackouts in a couple of days.

10:29.335 --> 10:30.700
I'm hoping that's all done.

10:30.735 --> 10:31.865
Yeah. I do too.

10:31.900 --> 10:34.600
But I still think you should tell your dad 
about it and get yourself checked out.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.100
You want to go with me to see the kills?

10:37.200 --> 10:40.300
Okay.
So we're ignoring the whole blackout thing. Or...

10:40.335 --> 10:41.265
pretty much.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.700
They go on at 8:00.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.400
You should come.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.900
The TSA is putting a flag on Ian Dravitt and his known associates.

10:50.935 --> 10:52.765
They'll call us if anyone shows up in seattle.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.700
This whole dravitt thing is just collier's latest deal gone south.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.650
Collier had his name on the side of a 
skyscraper by the time he was 30.

11:00.685 --> 11:04.492
You pursue power that ruthlessly.
You pick up some enemies along the way.

11:04.527 --> 11:08.300
So we find the one who seems most
 like John Hinckley or Sirhan Sirhan.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.465
And then do what?

11:09.500 --> 11:11.700
Follow him around for the rest of his natural life?

11:11.900 --> 11:15.300
We could spend the next year looking at 
Collier's moves since he founded the center.

11:15.335 --> 11:17.265
The guy had a whole career before he got abducted.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.400
Or maybe it is coming from someone who collier's never met.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.465
I mean. If you hate the 4400.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.900
Killing their figurehead's a good way to make them suffer.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.665
But what are we supposed to do?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.600
The potential victim has refused our help.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.100
No one said stopping the future was going to be easy.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.700
Diana. Iook at this.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.265
His name is miles quinlan.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.000
Claims collier bankrupted him.
Then kicked him out of the center.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.500
Lives with his parents

11:44.700 --> 11:45.765
What.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.700
Nursing a persecution complex?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.600
Pretty much a póster boy for the lone gunman theory.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.750
Come on. Maia.
I've named every guy

11:56.785 --> 11:58.800
I've dated for like the last five years.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.700
Are you telling me I don't have a future with any of them?

12:02.600 --> 12:03.700
I wouldn't worry about it.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.200
Seems like you meet a lot of boys.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
Yeah. Well. That's the trouble.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.700
I'm tired of meeting boys.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.400
I want to meet a man.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.700
You will.

12:11.900 --> 12:13.100
When?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.265
Aunt april.

12:14.300 --> 12:18.000
Just because I don't see it doesn't
 mean it's not going to happen.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.900
Oh. That's probably mrs. Bradshaw from upstairs.

12:20.935 --> 12:22.700
She's going to watch you tonight while I go to work.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.765
I'm sorry.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.400
It's not my fault.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.600
You recognize me.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.500
You're jordan collier.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.400
I didn't mean to frighten her.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.500
I just wanted to talk to her for a minute.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.300
Yeah. Well.
Doesn't look like that's going to happen.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.000
She believes I'm going to die.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.600
Please give her my apologies.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.400
I brought this for her.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.600
I hope she doesn't already have one.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.200
Thanks.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.165
Hi. I'm lily tyler.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.500
- I think someone was asking for me-
- excuse me.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.200
Heidi...

13:37.000 --> 13:38.400
are you my mother?

13:45.300 --> 13:46.900
I heard them fighting about you.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.000
My mom and dad... Carol.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.400
It's okay that I still call her "mom." right?

13:53.435 --> 13:55.465
I know it's confusing. Baby.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.500
Just 'cause they're talking in the other 
room doesn't mean I can't hear them.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.600
They said you were one of the 4400.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.200
That's why I was gone.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.000
That's why we don't know each other.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.500
Didn't you come to our house once?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.900
It's the first thing I did when I got back.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.000
I wanted to see you.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.800
But your dad and I.
We weren't sure it was a good idea.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.500
Sweetie. Does your father know you came down here?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.065
No.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.400
I didn't tell them I heard.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.000
I didn't go to school today.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.050
I came here instead.

14:35.085 --> 14:35.900
I'm glad you did.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.065
Was it hard for you not to see me?

14:38.100 --> 14:40.400
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.800
I think about you every single day.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.100
Look at this.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.065
Is that me?

14:55.100 --> 14:57.200
That was the day we brought 
you back from the hospital.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.100
You look the same as you do now.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.300
I was gone so long. But...

15:03.200 --> 15:04.565
to me...

15:04.600 --> 15:06.800
this feels like yesterday.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.665
You want to talk about collier?

15:14.700 --> 15:16.700
He uses people up and leaves them on the curb.

15:16.735 --> 15:18.167
Is that why you left the center?

15:18.202 --> 15:19.565
I didn't leave. They threw me out.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.100
That's what happens when you run out of money.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.600
They have all these different levels.
They call them keys. Right?

15:23.635 --> 15:25.365
You make seventh key. You're unlocked.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.965
"Unlocked"...meaning you've got your own 4400 ability?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Well. That's the big prize.
Only they set it up so no one ever gets there.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.600
There's mid-levels and side seminars you have to pass.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.500
If you're not one of the 4400. each one costs.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.165
First I ate up my savings.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.200
Then I cashed out the equity in my house.

15:40.900 --> 15:41.965
And they didn't deliver.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.265
Soon as the first check bounced.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.200
They told me I'd reached maximum 
potential and sent me on my way.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.200
Is that why you applied for a handgun permit?

15:49.500 --> 15:51.300
We ran a vicap check on you this morning.

15:51.335 --> 15:52.465
So I bought a gun. So what?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.265
I need to protect myself from collier.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.100
Yeah. Well.
I hope self-defense is all you have in mind.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.665
Because if you're planning anything else.

15:58.700 --> 16:02.100
We will be all over you the minute you approach the 4400 center.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.100
You want something to be paranoid about? Think about that.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.200
You're simplifying the issue.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.000
Canceling the gala is no guarantee of my safety.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.800
It's a start.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.000
Jordan. You just told me there's a little girl out there

16:20.035 --> 16:22.300
who can see the future and she saw you dead.

16:22.335 --> 16:24.000
It's time to make yourself scarce.

16:24.035 --> 16:25.400
And where does it stop?

16:27.500 --> 16:29.200
Do I stay away from the center?

16:29.235 --> 16:30.967
I cut myself off from our work?

16:31.002 --> 16:33.201
Yeah. If it means staying alive.

16:33.236 --> 16:35.400
I am not going to become a hermit.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.600
That is not a win for us.

16:38.300 --> 16:41.465
Look. The center is significantly safer than it seems.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.600
Half the people you see in workmen's 
uniforms are bodyguards.

16:44.635 --> 16:45.865
Are you looking to die in public?

16:45.900 --> 16:47.665
You're developing a real flair for drama.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.800
You know. This is hanging over my head.
Not yours.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.550
Look. I'm sorry. Jordan. I'm just-

16:55.585 --> 16:58.100
I am not ready to become a martyr.

16:58.135 --> 17:00.200
And you don't have to be.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.200
I know you've been looking forward 
to this weekend for a long time.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.065
Bringing all the 4400 together.

17:06.099 --> 17:09.400
It's like a validation for everything you've done so far.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.500
But if something happens to you.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It could undo everything that we've started.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.000
The movement's not ready for you to be a martyr. Either.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.150
Just...

17:30.185 --> 17:31.400
Go. Go.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.500
Where'd you go? I was about to have them page you.

17:45.535 --> 17:47.600
Richard. There's someone I want to introduce to you.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.800
This is my daughter.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.400
Heidi.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.400
She came to the center to meet me. We've been talking.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.765
Well.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.565
It's very nice to meet you.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.600
I'm richard tyler. I'm married to lily-

18:01.900 --> 18:03.200
- your mother.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.265
She told me.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.400
It's nice to meet you. Too.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.050
Is that...

18:08.085 --> 18:09.000
isabelle.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.100
This is your half-sister.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.000
Don't be scared.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.665
I'm sorry.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.200
She must be hungry.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.800
It's okay.

18:26.300 --> 18:27.900
I should probably get home anyway.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.500
Well. I hope I can see you again.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.200
I hope so. Too.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.500
Maybe next time I can hold isabelle.

18:34.535 --> 18:36.100
I bet we could make that happen.

18:36.135 --> 18:37.400
I'll walk you out.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.400
No more cutting school. Okay?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.600
What's the matter?

18:47.800 --> 18:51.065
All I'm saying is he was taller than I pictured him.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.700
Well. Tall or short.
Collier had no business showing up here.

18:54.735 --> 18:56.700
I totally agree. Di.
I didn't let him in.

18:56.735 --> 18:59.100
Aunt april likes tall boys.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.600
Oh. So you're talking about men to my daughter?

19:03.635 --> 19:04.700
She's a child.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.900
It might have come up in passing.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.400
Hey. Mom?
How come you never go out on dates?

19:12.700 --> 19:15.065
Well. I wouldn't say never.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.965
But aunt april Goes out all the time.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.900
Well. I think your aunt's an extreme example.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.800
How do I know which one is right?

19:22.100 --> 19:23.965
Not many or lots?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.700
I think that you should probably shoot 
for somewhere in the middle.

19:27.735 --> 19:28.865
I'll try.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.100
But do dates always have to be with boys?

19:31.135 --> 19:32.500
They're so gross.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.265
You get used to them.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.700
Can we have this conversation. Like in two or three.

19:37.735 --> 19:39.200
Maybe 10 years?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.000
What's that?

19:42.200 --> 19:44.400
Oh. A lady dropped it off today.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.900
Oh It's a subpoena.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.065
What's that?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.600
Well. It's when someone wants you 
to give them something.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.400
Who's it from?

19:56.100 --> 19:57.900
It's from my bosses.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.300
What do they want?

20:02.500 --> 20:03.800
Your diary.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.300
Kyle! You okay. Man?

20:22.300 --> 20:24.100
You didn't have a drink. Did you?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.000
Just diet coke.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.100
It's really loud in there. Huh?

20:30.135 --> 20:31.500
Yeah. But they're great. Huh?

20:31.535 --> 20:32.800
You want to go back in?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.700
Come on. My buddy's saving us a spot by the stage.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.000
Do you know what time it is?

21:15.300 --> 21:16.700
What are you doing here?

21:17.200 --> 21:19.300
Kyle! Do you know what time it is?

21:20.900 --> 21:23.300
What are you doing outside my apartment?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.500
I don't know. I was at the pub.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.400
You're scaring me.
How long have you been out here?

21:33.600 --> 21:35.500
I don't know...
I think I was digging or something.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.365
Look. Kyle. I think you should go.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.465
- We can talk about this-
- I'm sorry.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.600
I didn't mean to scare you.
It just happened again.

21:45.900 --> 21:46.700
Let me in.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.100
Get your hands off of me! You don't understand.

21:50.135 --> 21:52.600
He's a fraud. All of you.
Do you hear me?

21:52.635 --> 21:54.767
Your golden boy is a big fraud.

21:54.802 --> 21:56.900
Liv. You need to calm down.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.100
It's okay. Guys. I got it.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.500
My whole life.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.700
I have been looking for just one thing.

22:05.735 --> 22:08.200
Just one thing to believe in.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.100
I thought it was you.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.900
How long ago did you get high?

22:26.300 --> 22:28.465
You gonna help me up. Or what?

22:28.500 --> 22:30.500
Are you going to stop yelling at me?

22:30.535 --> 22:34.800
I am done with you altogether.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.800
Go back to your penthouse.

22:37.835 --> 22:39.700
Pretend we don't exist.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.500
Everyone else does.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.400
Why not you?

22:45.100 --> 22:46.100
Listen...

22:47.000 --> 22:48.300
easy.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.600
I'm not going to sen d youoff into the night like this.

22:52.635 --> 22:54.100
You can sleep on my couch.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
I got you.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.800
It's okay.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.100
You started all this. You know.

23:27.500 --> 23:31.000
Everything around you took shape 
after you showed me where to go.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.400
I don't know what to do. Though.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.900
I could count the number of times I've 
said that on one hand.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
But right now it's true.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.365
That's right. If you know anything...

23:45.400 --> 23:48.900
now would be a good time to tell uncle jordan. Huh?

23:50.500 --> 23:51.400
Oh...

24:32.500 --> 24:34.100
thank you.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.200
Thank you.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.600
The reunion goes forward.

25:27.700 --> 25:31.000
Diana. One of dravitt's hired guns 
flew into town last night.

25:31.035 --> 25:32.467
His name is laurent ganning.

25:32.502 --> 25:33.865
Tsa had his alias flagged.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.465
Well. Do we have a present whereabouts?

25:35.500 --> 25:39.200
He just checked into a motel in first hill 
under the name "lawrence gawain"

25:53.900 --> 25:55.500
It's clear.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.000
Tom...

26:10.700 --> 26:12.000
he's on the move.

26:37.100 --> 26:40.365
Wendy. Wait. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.900
You were waiting in the hallway 
outside my apartment last night.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.265
Do you know how weird that is?

26:44.300 --> 26:47.000
I don't know how I got there. Please. 
Believe me. I...  l...

26:47.035 --> 26:49.067
I had another blackout last night.

26:49.102 --> 26:51.065
Look. Kyle. This is getting bad.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.000
And I can't give you tHe kind of help that you need.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.800
So you want me to just go away?

26:55.900 --> 26:57.100
No. I...

26:57.600 --> 26:59.300
I want you to talk to someone.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.700
Someone qualified.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.000
I'm scared for you.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.900
Scared for me or scared of me?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.665
And we are humbled by the bravery 
of our foreign guests.

27:19.700 --> 27:23.700
Many of whom risked so much to be here today...
you know. Glen.

27:23.735 --> 27:25.265
I'm getting some nasty echos.

27:25.300 --> 27:28.300
Can we adjust the levels on the speakers in the back?

27:28.800 --> 27:31.700
Testing. Testing. One. Two. Three. Testing.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.700
You know. That's a lot better.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.665
Nobody moves!

28:01.700 --> 28:04.000
Everyone stay right where you are.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.300
Don't move. Don't move!

28:09.100 --> 28:10.265
Get your hands on your head.

28:10.300 --> 28:13.500
Get them up. Turn around. Turn around!

28:13.800 --> 28:16.200
Get down. Down. Down!

28:25.700 --> 28:28.400
Ganning's pistol was made from synthetic polymers.

28:28.435 --> 28:29.465
The bullets. Too.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.700
He walked it right through your metal
detectors without so much as a peep.

28:32.735 --> 28:33.717
You were Round to get him.

28:33.752 --> 28:34.665
He never would have killed me.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.300
He was standing two feet away 
from you with a loaded firearm.

28:37.335 --> 28:39.567
The whole thing was put in motion by maia.

28:39.602 --> 28:41.765
Your daughter's visión was a gift to me.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.700
A prescription. If you will.
For changing the future.

28:44.735 --> 28:47.565
In one chain of events.
Ganning's bullet killed me.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.300
I can only assume that somebody 
has a different plan for me.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.450
Well. I wouldn't be putting my feet up by the fire just yet.

28:54.485 --> 28:57.165
I have no intention of canceling the extra security measures.

28:57.200 --> 29:01.300
The same extra measures that just allowed 
an assassin to walk right up to you.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.600
Would ntac like a presence at the gala tomorrow?

29:03.635 --> 29:04.465
Yes.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.600
Mr. Collier. We don't stand off to the side and watch.

29:07.635 --> 29:08.900
We take command.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.700
I'll issue credentials.

29:11.300 --> 29:15.400
That was a rather dramatic demonstration 
of competence just now.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.300
What time is it?

29:24.700 --> 29:26.300
It's about 2:00.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.100
How'd I end up here. Anyway?

29:33.300 --> 29:34.765
Liv. You were pretty far gone last night.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.600
But are you really telling me you don't remember?

29:38.600 --> 29:40.400
I remember.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.300
You don't have to hover over me.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.300
I'm not going to steal anything.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.000
The maid can come in and clean the 
couch as soon as I'm gone.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.100
How many of these nights do you 
think you have left in you?

29:54.300 --> 29:55.900
Hopefully not too many.

29:55.935 --> 29:57.500
You've seen my life.

29:57.535 --> 29:58.665
When I O. D...

29:58.700 --> 30:00.400
It's not gonna be any big loss.

30:00.435 --> 30:01.365
That is not true.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.800
How's it going to change?

30:03.900 --> 30:05.500
I used to feel the same way.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.700
I meant what I told you.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.165
I can't save the whole worid.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.400
And I can't even save your friends.

30:14.435 --> 30:15.665
And I'm sorry.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.900
But if you're serious about wanting a change.

30:18.300 --> 30:19.900
Maybe I can save you.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.500
How?

30:24.700 --> 30:28.700
By giving you the same thing that saved me.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.500
He's here.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.300
Hi. Good to see you.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.700
Excuse me.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.150
Hello. My love.

31:14.185 --> 31:15.400
Here we go.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.800
I think I have to...

31:21.900 --> 31:23.300
nice to meet you

31:25.600 --> 31:26.800
Pleasure to see you.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.000
Excuse me. Sir.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.100
All the guestscheck out so far.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.900
Yeah. We secured the surrounding rooftops.
Did a bomb sweep.

31:39.935 --> 31:42.500
So now it's cross-our-fingers time.

31:43.400 --> 31:44.600
Yeah.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.465
Good afternoon.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.150
Thank you for coming to the center.

31:50.185 --> 31:51.800
We have a great day planned for you.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.265
But before we get started.

31:54.300 --> 31:57.250
I'd like to thank the man that made this all possible.

31:57.285 --> 32:00.200
I mean that literally... he didn't just pay for the food.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.900
He built this place.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.565
And this movement.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.000
So I'd like you to please welcome my mentor.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.300
My friend... mr. Jordan collier.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
Thank you.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.300
And thank you. Shawn.
For that introduction.

32:25.400 --> 32:30.600
We are humbled by the bravery of our foreign guests.

32:30.635 --> 32:33.500
Many of whom risked so much to be here today.

32:34.700 --> 32:35.665
Let's go.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.200
I just want to hear what the man has to say for himself.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.100
Jordan?

33:08.400 --> 33:10.000
He's up there! Go!

33:11.200 --> 33:12.800
Everybody stay down!

33:16.700 --> 33:17.900
We've got a shooter.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.400
Everyone calm down! Just stay down. Stay down!

33:21.800 --> 33:27.800
We've got a shooter.

33:27.835 --> 33:29.000
Let me go.

33:30.500 --> 33:34.300
Jordan! Oh. My god!

33:38.000 --> 33:39.800
Oh. God...

34:06.800 --> 34:08.400
please let me go. Please!

34:21.100 --> 34:22.699
Get that stretcher ready.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.400
Pulse is weak and thready come on let's go harry up!

35:00.800 --> 35:01.950
Breathing's stopped.

35:01.985 --> 35:03.100
We're losing him again.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.500
No! You're not going anywhere yet.

35:11.700 --> 35:16.900
Shawn! She told me to go through with it.

35:16.935 --> 35:17.900
Who did?

35:19.400 --> 35:20.800
She lies.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.165
No...

35:23.200 --> 35:25.900
don't go anywhere no...

35:39.800 --> 35:41.800
- Lily. I need to-
- brian. I don't have much time.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.800
I did not violate our agreement.

35:43.835 --> 35:44.900
Heidi found me.

35:44.935 --> 35:45.665
Lily.

35:45.700 --> 35:46.800
Heidi's sick.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.400
She's in the hospital.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.200
It happened yesterday.

35:50.700 --> 35:51.865
Something with her spleen.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.600
They had to operate right away.

35:53.635 --> 35:55.000
Is she okay?

35:55.300 --> 35:56.200
Can I see her?

35:56.235 --> 35:57.065
She's okay.

35:57.100 --> 36:00.000
She's still recovering from the anesthesia.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.200
She's been asking for you.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.865
She's still in recovery now.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.900
But Carol thinks it's all right if you 
want to get in there tomorrow.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.800
Brian. What happened?

36:10.300 --> 36:12.900
Her spleen? She's 12 years old.

36:12.935 --> 36:14.100
It just ruptured.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.700
Her doctors said they've never seen anything like it.
Even they can't tell us why.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.800
Where you been?
The funeral's about to start.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.500
Lily. What's wrong?
What is it?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.300
Heidi's sick.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.900
And I think isabelle's responsible.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.200
I think they're ready for you.

37:33.700 --> 37:39.100
You are going to read a lot about 
Jordan Collier in the next few weeks.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.950
Some of it good.

37:41.985 --> 37:43.400
A lot of it bad...

37:44.400 --> 37:46.700
I will be ignoring all of it.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.200
Just like jordan would have.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.565
Because jordan may have used the media.

37:52.600 --> 37:56.900
But he never allowed himself to be seduced by it.

37:57.700 --> 38:02.200
I could tell you how much I owe the man.

38:02.700 --> 38:09.200
He took me in when I was feeling lost and alone. Confused.

38:09.235 --> 38:12.300
I'm sure many of you have similar stories.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.700
The fact is that everyone alive today.

38:17.100 --> 38:20.300
Whether they know it or not.
Owes jordan collier.

38:20.335 --> 38:23.200
He had a visión to save the future.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.100
And he gave us that visión.

38:27.400 --> 38:32.100
And now he won't be here to see us achieve it...

38:33.700 --> 38:35.900
but we will achieve it.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.100
I promise you.
We will achieve it.

38:41.300 --> 38:44.400
We have all suffered a tremendous loss.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.500
We are heartbroken and bleeding on the inside.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.700
But we will not let that stop us.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.800
And I will not let that stop me.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.565
We will honor jordan collier.

39:06.600 --> 39:13.000
And we will create the better future that he died building.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.100
Thank you for coming.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.600
Goodbye.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.900
Nice words. Shawn.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.300
I think collier would have approved.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.200
Yeah. I hope so.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.900
He would have liked that you came.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.700
Oh. I don't think I was that high on his radar.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.050
Don't be too sure.

39:35.085 --> 39:36.165
You guys bumped heads.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.565
But you believed the same thing.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.700
That the 4400 are the key to the future.

39:40.100 --> 39:41.365
Your goals were identical.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.150
But our methods were different.

39:43.185 --> 39:44.900
Not as different as you think.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.800
See. That's where your view of 
Jordan Collier splits from mine.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.700
Well. At least we have some common ground.

39:54.400 --> 39:59.500
Maybe your side and my side can work together 
now that I'm assuming new duties around here.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.400
You're becoming quite the little politician. Shawn.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.100
Now I know collier would have been proud of you.

40:07.900 --> 40:08.965
He's gone.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.900
Is body.
It's not there.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.800
Someone stole the body.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.300
There's only one way out.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.400
And we were standing right in front of it.
Stole it how?

40:26.435 --> 40:28.200
Then what happened?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.650
<i>All lying across the ground</i>

41:01.685 --> 41:04.265
<i>try not to make no sound</i>

41:04.300 --> 41:07.000
<i>to make or break you down I said</i>

41:07.035 --> 41:09.700
<i>to make or break you down I break</i>

41:10.000 --> 41:15.100
<i>all lying across the ground try not to make no sound</i>

41:15.135 --> 41:17.967
<i>to make or break you down I said</i>

41:18.002 --> 41:20.800
<i>to make or break you down I break</i>

41:31.600 --> 41:34.000
<i>I take down what I need</i>

41:34.200 --> 41:36.750
<i>'cause you know I need to breathe</i>

41:36.785 --> 41:39.592
<i>I'm tired of walking on another plane</i>

41:39.627 --> 41:42.400
<i>another plane 'cause I feel insane</i>

41:42.435 --> 41:44.900
<i>I step back to get to you</i>

41:45.200 --> 41:47.500
<i>cut back I'm falling through</i>

41:47.800 --> 41:49.865
<i>another day I feel the same</i>

41:49.900 --> 41:53.300
<i>I'm cutting and I'm bleeding here with you</i>
