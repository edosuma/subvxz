WEBVTT

00:00.340 --> 00:02.501
Do you enjoy ransacking the church?

00:02.542 --> 00:06.308
I don't call searching
for IRA weapons ransacking.

00:07.846 --> 00:10.509
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a wraith.

00:10.550 --> 00:12.677
You just kind of look like someone I know.

00:12.719 --> 00:15.085
May the saints preserve him.

00:16.522 --> 00:18.581
He's my half-brother.

00:18.624 --> 00:20.421
What are you up to, Father?

00:20.460 --> 00:23.020
You stole the ashes of the Crozier of St Patrick

00:23.062 --> 00:25.257
from me poor church and I want 'em back.

00:25.298 --> 00:29.701
To think I hold the very crown Henry Vlll
placed on Anne Boleyn's head.

00:29.736 --> 00:31.931
And while she still had it, I hope.

00:37.076 --> 00:40.273
I'm not an investigator
who takes pictures through keyholes.

00:40.313 --> 00:43.908
I told your manager when he hired me.
I don't even peek through them.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.407
Get closer.

00:46.452 --> 00:49.080
Hey, man, this is a helicopter. It makes noise.

00:49.122 --> 00:52.683
Your wife is having an affair.

00:54.127 --> 00:59.030
Isn't this exciting?
Just like an Agatha Christie novel.

03:01.087 --> 03:04.921
The Crozier of St Patrick
is typical of the small Catholic churches

03:04.957 --> 03:07.425
found throughout Northern Ireland.

03:07.460 --> 03:13.490
That particular edifice was founded by
a young Irish monk in the mid 1500s.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.831
1538.

03:15.868 --> 03:20.567
The priest supposedly collected
the ashes of St Patrick's Crozier,

03:20.606 --> 03:23.598
or shepherd's crook,
when it was burned in Dublin.

03:23.643 --> 03:26.111
There's no supposing about it.

03:26.145 --> 03:32.516
This particular incident occurred
when a few overzealous Anglo-Irish

03:32.552 --> 03:39.549
exceeded the intent of Henry VIII's edict
to unify and anglicize the Irish Church.

03:39.592 --> 03:41.822
What the lass is trying to say...

03:43.095 --> 03:45.256
is that like most Englishmen...

03:46.265 --> 03:49.598
fat Henry thought he was above God.

03:49.635 --> 03:52.069
Not God, the Pope.

03:52.104 --> 03:55.335
You wouldn't be Anglican now, would you?

03:55.374 --> 03:59.208
In any case, I won't argue the point
in front of these good tourists,

03:59.245 --> 04:04.182
who I'm sure are dying to drop
an American dollar or two in the poor box

04:04.217 --> 04:08.119
for the privilege of glimpsing
the ashes of the Crozier of St Patrick.

04:08.154 --> 04:12.557
All fees for the sights we visit
are included in the tour.

04:12.592 --> 04:14.184
Aye, she's Anglican.

04:16.562 --> 04:22.228
This is just one of four churches claiming
to have the ashes of St Patrick's Crozier.

04:22.268 --> 04:25.965
It was a big staff. Had to be
to get rid of all those snakes.

04:26.706 --> 04:32.804
You'll find this part of the British Isles
full of legends and tales,

04:32.845 --> 04:37.214
most of which, I'm afraid, are pure blarney.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.242
I'll wager she doesn't believe
in leprechauns either.

05:05.211 --> 05:07.679
That's bloody disgusting, Paddy.

05:07.713 --> 05:09.704
Not if you're poor, it's not.

05:10.883 --> 05:13.181
Why don't you have a new one?

05:13.219 --> 05:15.210
No thanks, Brigadier.

05:17.123 --> 05:20.251
- You're smoking butt ends?
- Dropped by a Yank.

05:20.293 --> 05:22.284
Not a Brit.

05:23.496 --> 05:25.964
Did you enjoy ransacking me church?

05:26.632 --> 05:31.262
I don't call searching for
IRA weapons ransacking, Father.

05:31.304 --> 05:34.205
And did you find any?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.901
Not this time.

05:35.941 --> 05:40.435
But when I do, neither the cloth
nor the collar will protect you.

05:40.479 --> 05:44.779
Being a priest hasn't protected
an Irishman since fat Henry.

05:46.519 --> 05:50.353
Yes, that's as maybe.
Good day to you, Father McGuinness.

05:50.389 --> 05:52.220
Brigadier.

06:07.306 --> 06:09.365
Aah.

06:09.408 --> 06:10.898
Father McGuinness!

06:11.977 --> 06:13.467
What are you up to?

06:13.512 --> 06:16.504
I was just taking a drop
of medicine for me cold.

06:16.549 --> 06:20.280
I'm not talking about
your bloody Irish whiskey.

06:20.319 --> 06:24.153
I'm talking about the ashes
of St Patrick's Crozier.

06:24.190 --> 06:27.523
They're gone.
I don't know what you're trying to pull.

06:27.560 --> 06:32.259
If this is some sort of Irish trick
to get more money from us, it won't work.

06:32.298 --> 06:36.997
As far as I'm concerned, this abrogates
our contract with your church.

06:37.937 --> 06:42.340
The tourist business isn't exactly
booming in Northern Ireland, you know.

06:47.046 --> 06:50.743
<i>Even though Hawaii is visited
by four million tourists a year,</i>

06:50.783 --> 06:53.251
<i>the islanders have a way
of making each one feel</i>

06:53.285 --> 06:56.618
<i>as if he or she is the first
to discover their island paradise.</i>

06:56.655 --> 06:59.249
<i>That's what they call the aloha spirit</i>.

07:03.796 --> 07:07.459
<i>Tri Island Airways flight 10
now arriving at gate 17.</i>

07:07.500 --> 07:11.459
<i>Tri Island Airways flight 10
now arriving at gate 17.</i>

07:21.147 --> 07:24.173
<i>First thing
a good private investigator learns</i>

07:24.216 --> 07:26.810
<i>when tailing a suspect
is to blend with the crowd,</i>

07:26.852 --> 07:30.788
<i>especially if that suspect
is a suspicious woman.</i>

07:31.524 --> 07:36.086
<i>It isn't as easy as it looks. One has to be
constantly on guard for the unexpected.</i>

07:49.708 --> 07:52.302
<i>Second thing
a good private investigator learns</i>

07:52.344 --> 07:55.074
<i>is to act perfectly natural if spotted</i>.

07:55.114 --> 07:59.448
<i>I had to give Legs</i> - <i>that's what</i>
<i>I code-named my client's wife</i> -

07:59.485 --> 08:03.888
<i>the impression that I just happened to be
heading for the same bar she was.</i>

08:03.923 --> 08:05.720
<i>This works on everyone,</i>

08:05.758 --> 08:08.454
<i>except paranoids like Legs</i>.

08:08.494 --> 08:13.557
<i>Which means, to walk into that bar,
I had to get very creative.</i>

08:26.846 --> 08:28.677
Aloha.

08:30.916 --> 08:32.577
May I join you?

08:32.618 --> 08:36.110
Well, that depends, now. Are you buying?

08:36.155 --> 08:39.181
Bartender, another drink for my friend here

08:39.225 --> 08:41.818
and I'll have a Virgin Mary.

08:41.861 --> 08:44.056
Well, now, are you a religious man?

08:44.864 --> 08:46.525
Not exactly.

08:46.565 --> 08:48.726
<i>O</i> h, Virgin Mary!

08:48.767 --> 08:50.860
That's a drink without liquor in it.

08:51.704 --> 08:53.695
Blasphemy.

08:59.712 --> 09:01.873
Can't afford the filthy habit.

09:01.914 --> 09:03.745
Not on a priest's pittance.

09:05.484 --> 09:11.548
<i>O</i> h! I'm sorry, Father.
It's so dark in here that I didn't notice.

09:11.590 --> 09:14.320
My name's Magnum. Thomas Magnum.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.954
Father Paddy McGuinness, County Armagh.

09:16.996 --> 09:19.157
- Ireland?
- Northern Ireland.

09:26.539 --> 09:29.906
- Did I say that right?
- You said it just fine.

09:32.711 --> 09:34.702
Bingo.

09:38.651 --> 09:41.677
It's him. It's the same Suntan
that she met in the movies.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.745
<i>O</i> h, no.

09:43.789 --> 09:49.284
- That's sad. Your wife, is it?
- <i>O</i> h, I'm not married.

09:49.328 --> 09:51.626
You're not living in sin, are you?

09:51.664 --> 09:53.825
I don't believe in it, Father.

09:53.866 --> 09:57.962
Why are you hiding behind me
and spying on that lass?

10:00.239 --> 10:05.404
Normally I couldn't say but you being
a priest and all, I guess it's <i>O</i> K.

10:06.245 --> 10:10.648
I'm a private investigator
and her husband hired me to follow her.

10:11.483 --> 10:17.149
A big, strapping lad like you spending
your time spying on unfaithful wives?

10:17.189 --> 10:20.317
- That's not all I do.
- It is a sad thing.

10:20.359 --> 10:21.917
Father, you don't understand.

10:21.961 --> 10:24.725
Probably the only good to come of it

10:24.763 --> 10:29.132
is this glass of Irish whiskey
you so generously purchased for me.

10:30.603 --> 10:32.537
Bartender.

10:32.571 --> 10:38.237
<i>O</i> n the other hand I suppose a man
is entitled to earn a living as best he can

10:38.277 --> 10:41.576
and committing adultery is
breaking the eighth commandment.

10:43.415 --> 10:47.283
Eighth commandment?
I thought that was "Thou shalt not steal".

10:47.319 --> 10:51.585
Is it, now? I always get those two confused.

10:57.463 --> 10:59.761
What if they're getting on a plane?

10:59.798 --> 11:04.497
Well, she didn't have any luggage.
He did, so I figure he just flew in.

11:06.839 --> 11:09.637
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a wraith.

11:10.342 --> 11:13.311
<i>O</i> h, uh... it's nothing.

11:13.345 --> 11:15.643
You just kind of look like someone I know.

11:16.281 --> 11:18.340
May the saints preserve him.

11:21.387 --> 11:26.290
- Here they come. Sure you don't mind?
- It'll add a little excitement to me dull life.

11:29.194 --> 11:31.662
I want a good one for your Aunt Katie.

11:31.697 --> 11:36.100
She's always complaining
there'll be nothing for me tombstone.

11:36.135 --> 11:42.165
<i>Inter-island Airways
Flight 844 is now arriving at Gate 18.</i>

11:43.609 --> 11:48.308
Terrific, Uncle Paddy. Come on.
We got to hurry or you'll miss your plane.

11:49.748 --> 11:51.477
Nothing for your tombstone?

11:51.517 --> 11:54.213
I couldn't think of anything else to say.

11:58.190 --> 12:01.455
Although this chart only
goes back to William and Mary,

12:01.493 --> 12:04.018
we can trace our roots to Henry VIII.

12:04.063 --> 12:07.829
My Great Aunt Matilda, who was
lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria

12:07.866 --> 12:10.391
claimed we went back to Richard I,

12:10.436 --> 12:14.099
or Richard the Lionheart
as you lads probably know him.

12:15.040 --> 12:19.739
Unfortunately, she never actually
authenticated the line with papers.

12:19.778 --> 12:24.112
I suppose if one goes back far enough,
anyone can lay claim to some peerage.

12:24.149 --> 12:26.310
Higgins!

12:26.351 --> 12:28.012
Well, almost anyone.

12:29.722 --> 12:32.555
You are not gonna believe this.

12:32.591 --> 12:35.185
I met this priest in a bar
while I was tailing Legs.

12:35.227 --> 12:37.695
- I already find it preposterous.
- Guess what?

12:37.730 --> 12:40.756
- I'd really rather not.
- What is that?

12:40.799 --> 12:42.960
I should think it's rather obvious.

12:43.001 --> 12:45.799
Are you tracing the lads' pedigree?

12:45.838 --> 12:48.932
It's the genealogical history
of the Higgins family.

12:48.974 --> 12:52.535
- <i>O</i> h, No offence, lads.
- Magnum, what do you want?

12:52.578 --> 12:55.445
- Like I said...
- You were tailing someone called Legs

12:55.481 --> 12:57.108
and you met this priest.

12:57.149 --> 13:00.880
Not just a priest, Higgins,
an Irish priest. And guess what?

13:00.919 --> 13:02.910
I said I'd really rather not.

13:03.622 --> 13:05.556
He looked like you.

13:05.591 --> 13:09.687
How delightful.
An Irish priest is in the islands who...

13:14.399 --> 13:15.730
looks like me.

13:15.768 --> 13:17.463
Ha!

13:17.503 --> 13:22.566
I knew it would get to you.
How many people in the world look like... you?

13:22.608 --> 13:25.372
- <i>O</i> f course he wasn't exactly like you.
- He wasn't?

13:25.410 --> 13:27.401
He had curly hair and a beard.

13:29.148 --> 13:31.844
Higgins! Don't take it so hard.

13:31.884 --> 13:34.648
I mean, we all have people who look like us.

13:34.686 --> 13:38.349
I've heard that in the world
there's an exact double for each of us.

13:38.390 --> 13:40.051
What is this priest's name?

13:40.092 --> 13:42.560
Father Paddy... Paddy...

13:42.594 --> 13:44.494
McGuinness.

13:44.530 --> 13:47.124
That's it! How did you know?

13:48.133 --> 13:51.261
He's my half-brother.

13:56.558 --> 14:02.622
Higgins, if Father Paddy is your half-brother,
why isn't his name on here?

14:03.831 --> 14:07.631
Because he's... illegitimate.

14:08.336 --> 14:11.828
- You mean like your brother Elmo?
- No, not like Elmo.

14:11.873 --> 14:15.400
I mean, yes, like Elmo
but the circumstances were different,

14:15.443 --> 14:17.911
I assure you.

14:17.946 --> 14:21.939
As I recall, it was during World War I.

14:21.983 --> 14:26.181
Your father was pulled from the trenches
desperately ill with influenza.

14:26.220 --> 14:29.519
He was taken to a field hospital
where Elmo's mother,

14:29.557 --> 14:31.115
a Red Cross nurse from Texas...

14:31.159 --> 14:34.595
Magnum, some things are better left unsaid.

14:34.629 --> 14:36.290
Of course.

14:37.098 --> 14:39.692
It was just after the Great War.

14:39.734 --> 14:42.635
Father, a major in
the Prince of Wales' Own Light Horse,

14:42.670 --> 14:45.264
was dispatched to Ireland
to quell the rebellion.

14:45.306 --> 14:49.766
Not the kind of officer to keep to table
and hearth, even in a bitter Irish winter,

14:49.811 --> 14:53.008
Father was leading a patrol
delivering milk to an orphanage.

14:53.047 --> 14:56.175
He was ambushed by the IRA.
Desperately wounded,

14:56.217 --> 14:59.709
he managed to hold the rebels off
until his men could safely escape,

14:59.754 --> 15:03.417
then he crawled into a bog
and hid in a snowbank.

15:03.458 --> 15:07.292
Early the next morning,
a young widow woman, foraging for fuel,

15:07.328 --> 15:10.092
found him and took him to her cottage.

15:10.131 --> 15:13.157
Those were hard times in Ireland
and peat was scarce,

15:13.201 --> 15:15.499
especially to a woman with no husband.

15:15.536 --> 15:18.061
Father was near frozen to death.

15:18.106 --> 15:21.598
So she... did the only thing
she could to get him warm.

15:21.643 --> 15:23.372
Of course.

15:23.411 --> 15:26.869
Being delirious, naturally Father
had no idea what she was doing.

15:26.914 --> 15:28.541
He told my mother the only thing

15:28.583 --> 15:32.610
that kept him going through that terrible ordeal
was the thought of her.

15:32.654 --> 15:34.485
- Of your mother?
- Yes!

15:37.492 --> 15:43.658
After he'd thawed out sufficiently,
he found his way back to his regiment

15:43.698 --> 15:45.495
and nine months later...

15:45.533 --> 15:48.696
Father Paddy was born!

15:48.736 --> 15:51.034
Well, he wasn't Father Paddy then.

15:51.072 --> 15:53.370
No, of course not, Higgins. Look.

15:53.408 --> 15:55.876
I don't want to cast aspersions on your father

15:55.910 --> 16:01.439
but considering how Elmo
and Father Paddy were, uh, sired,

16:01.482 --> 16:04.974
I mean, did it ever occur to you
that your father may be...

16:05.019 --> 16:06.680
No.

16:06.721 --> 16:08.814
I didn't think so.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.553
- What's he doing here?
- He didn't say, Higgins.

16:14.595 --> 16:18.122
I assumed he was on vacation.
I dropped him off at the Low Surf hotel.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.656
- How fitting.
- Come on.

16:19.701 --> 16:22.534
Everyone can't afford a beach front on Waikiki.

16:22.570 --> 16:25.698
- Of course, now he'll be staying here.
- Here? Here?

16:25.740 --> 16:29.232
Magnum, have you gone mad?
The opening of the Queen Mother's wing

16:29.277 --> 16:31.575
of the Hawaiian British Museum is this week.

16:31.612 --> 16:36.015
As president of the Anglo Society,
I'm in charge of the festivities.

16:36.050 --> 16:40.680
There will be a formal ball, famous personages
will be staying on the estate.

16:40.722 --> 16:43.190
I'm even making a phone call
to the Queen Mother

16:43.224 --> 16:45.055
to thank her for her contributions.

16:45.093 --> 16:50.326
And you expect me to play host
to a slovenly, alcoholic, illegitimate Irish priest?

16:50.364 --> 16:54.357
- Higgins, you're a bigot.
- <i>O</i> f course I am. Isn't everybody?

16:54.402 --> 16:57.530
- He's your brother.
- My illegitimate half-brother.

16:58.406 --> 17:02.809
You can call him anything you want, Higgins.
He is still your father's son.

17:09.483 --> 17:12.180
<i>I left Higgins to wrestle with his conscience</i>

17:12.220 --> 17:14.688
<i>and wrestled with a problem of my own</i> -

17:14.722 --> 17:18.818
<i>how to tell my client that his wife
was probably having an affair.</i>

17:19.993 --> 17:24.693
So, Clarence, I think that
maybe your wife is having...

17:26.501 --> 17:32.167
is not being quite as faithful
as you'd like her to be.

17:32.206 --> 17:36.575
Of course I could be wrong.
I don't really have any proof yet.

17:36.611 --> 17:38.636
I mean, like photos.

17:38.679 --> 17:44.515
Well, I got photos but nothing
of the two of them, you know, uh...

17:45.787 --> 17:50.121
Look, I'm not the kind of investigator
who takes pictures through keyholes.

17:50.158 --> 17:53.889
I told your manager that when he hired me.
I don't even peek through them.

17:53.928 --> 17:57.056
So I can't really know for sure whether Legs...

17:58.666 --> 18:03.729
your wife is really having...

18:06.107 --> 18:07.938
an affair.

18:09.177 --> 18:12.305
Why don't I just mail you the rest of my
report?

18:13.781 --> 18:17.444
On second thought,
maybe I ought to read it to you right now.

18:27.862 --> 18:31.457
"Last night she left your apartment
at seven and went to the movies."

18:31.499 --> 18:34.696
I'll bet you she told you
she went to the movies, am I right?

18:34.735 --> 18:37.033
Well, that's what she did.

18:37.071 --> 18:39.198
She even got one of those jumbo popcorns.

18:39.240 --> 18:44.507
You know, the big barrels with all the creamy
butter on top of it. That's what she did.

18:44.545 --> 18:46.536
Then she got...

18:47.515 --> 18:49.506
two soft drinks.

18:52.887 --> 18:56.550
Maybe she was thirsty.
Hey, popcorn'll do that to you.

18:56.591 --> 19:00.994
Especially if you use too much salt
and she salted the hell out of it.

19:01.028 --> 19:04.156
You really ought to talk to her
about that. It's not healthy.

19:04.198 --> 19:07.258
Oh. Yeah, OK. Yeah.

19:07.301 --> 19:11.135
Clarence, I don't think I can remember
all those details without my notes.

19:11.172 --> 19:13.333
But I'll try. Here we go.

19:14.342 --> 19:17.937
See, I followed her into the theater
and she sat down next to this guy.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.939
But she didn't act like she knew him.

19:20.982 --> 19:24.110
See, Clarence, I've got this theory.
You go to bed early.

19:24.151 --> 19:29.487
You wake up early and I understand
that fighters in training practice celibacy.

19:29.523 --> 19:31.821
Well, maybe... Clarence, just maybe,

19:31.859 --> 19:36.660
your wife is releasing
some pent-up libido by going to a film.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.358
Like...

19:39.200 --> 19:40.861
Leather Lovers.

19:41.769 --> 19:45.261
Clarence, where is your manager?
I'm not the guy for this.

19:45.306 --> 19:48.002
Do you know my time is costing you 300...

19:48.042 --> 19:52.274
250 a day, plus expenses,
which I'm holding to a minimum.

19:52.313 --> 19:56.716
All I've spent so far is a little gas money,
a movie ticket, some film

19:56.751 --> 19:59.276
and a couple of Irish whiskeys for a priest.

20:00.187 --> 20:02.883
No, wait. I can explain that.

20:05.092 --> 20:06.150
Um...

20:06.193 --> 20:09.685
This priest, he helped me
get a picture of your wife

20:09.730 --> 20:13.894
and the guy,
so that they wouldn't get suspicious.

20:13.935 --> 20:16.403
- Name?
- Father Paddy.

20:18.172 --> 20:21.608
Oh, the guy.
You want the name of the guy. I don't know.

20:21.642 --> 20:23.633
Find out.

20:29.083 --> 20:32.109
Clarence, I don't even know if this guy is...

20:35.890 --> 20:37.585
I'll get right on it.

21:27.808 --> 21:31.904
Room's 100 a week, 20 a day,
12.50 a half day, $5 an hour,

21:31.946 --> 21:34.107
2.50 extra if you want clean sheets.

21:34.148 --> 21:38.949
That's cash in advance and no swimsuits
or bare feet allowed in the lobby.

21:40.054 --> 21:43.217
My good man, I wouldn't be
caught dead in one of your rooms.

21:46.894 --> 21:49.454
No suicides either.

21:49.497 --> 21:52.159
I'm looking for Father Patrick McGuinness.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.865
Try the beach bar.

21:55.736 --> 21:57.067
Beach bar?

21:58.506 --> 22:00.497
On the roof.

22:09.517 --> 22:11.178
It don't work.

23:13.681 --> 23:16.377
Why would anyone call this the beach bar?

23:33.767 --> 23:37.134
Faith and begorrah. Johnny.

23:37.771 --> 23:40.535
It is you, me brother.

23:40.574 --> 23:42.132
Half-brother.

23:43.577 --> 23:46.102
It's been 15 years.

23:47.114 --> 23:50.379
- 17, to be precise.
- Let me look at you.

23:50.417 --> 23:51.907
You're fat as a fiddle.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.647
That's fit as a fiddle.

23:55.589 --> 23:58.285
Barkeep, give me brother whatever he wants.

23:58.325 --> 24:00.316
Glencadam on the rocks.

24:01.462 --> 24:05.330
That's Scotch. You do have Scotch, don't you?

24:05.366 --> 24:07.163
Yeah, sure we do. Uh...

24:07.201 --> 24:11.297
Bonnie Hawaii, made right here
in the islands, 3.50 a bottle.

24:12.139 --> 24:14.607
Pour him a spot of mine.

24:14.642 --> 24:18.738
They didn't have any Irish,
so I went out and bought me some.

24:18.779 --> 24:21.247
How did you know I was here?

24:21.282 --> 24:23.807
A rather bizarre coincidence.

24:23.851 --> 24:27.343
You met one of the guests
at Robin Masters' estate, Thomas Magnum.

24:27.388 --> 24:29.720
- The lad at the airport.
- Yes.

24:29.757 --> 24:33.420
Well, he said he dropped you off... here.

24:34.228 --> 24:37.254
Patrick, what are you doing in Hawaii?

24:43.804 --> 24:47.137
Hotel policy, I've got to put 'em in all the drinks.

24:50.244 --> 24:52.235
To Father.

24:55.716 --> 24:56.876
To Father.

25:03.857 --> 25:05.848
Now, what are you doing here?

25:05.893 --> 25:09.385
Well, Johnny, it's a long tale
and I don't want to bore you.

25:09.430 --> 25:11.864
You always did have
a tendency to run on a bit.

25:11.899 --> 25:15.266
Me, run on?

25:15.769 --> 25:19.261
You could put a leprechaun
to sleep on St Patrick's Day.

25:19.306 --> 25:23.709
Leprechauns and St Patrick's Day,
what sort of a metaphor is that?

25:23.744 --> 25:25.268
An Irish one.

25:26.146 --> 25:31.209
That's always been your problem, Patrick.
You can't shake those Gaelic roots.

25:33.020 --> 25:35.011
To the Queen.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.719
What's so humorous?

25:39.760 --> 25:43.093
Toasting the Queen with good Irish whiskey.

25:47.301 --> 25:49.826
I had hoped the years
might have changed you.

25:49.870 --> 25:53.362
I came here intending to remove you
from these squalid surroundings

25:53.407 --> 25:56.399
to offer you the hospitality
of Mr. Masters' estate.

25:56.443 --> 25:58.274
I should have known better.

25:58.312 --> 26:01.440
That you should have, Brit.

26:06.220 --> 26:10.520
I really must be going. With the new wing
of the museum opening on Sunday

26:10.557 --> 26:14.220
and my old brigadier arriving tomorrow,
I have a million things to do.

26:14.261 --> 26:16.286
Perhaps in another 17 years, Patrick.

26:17.831 --> 26:19.822
Goodbye.

26:20.968 --> 26:24.199
May the saints preserve me, what am I doing?

26:24.238 --> 26:26.399
Here my own flesh and blood seeks me out

26:26.440 --> 26:29.136
with nothing but brotherly love in his heart

26:29.176 --> 26:32.304
to offer me the hospitality
of his home and hearth

26:32.346 --> 26:34.814
and I treat him like a Dublin dustman.

26:34.848 --> 26:37.749
I would not blame you
if you withdrew your gracious offer

26:37.785 --> 26:40.413
and never spoke to me again, brother darling.

26:44.191 --> 26:45.522
Well, I...

26:45.559 --> 26:49.290
I'll pack me things and be with you
in three shakes of a leprechaun's leg.

27:00.808 --> 27:02.799
He's only my half-brother.

27:19.678 --> 27:22.203
What are they doing?

27:22.228 --> 27:24.389
That's pretty obvious, isn't it?

27:24.430 --> 27:26.421
Standing on their heads?

27:26.466 --> 27:30.197
Don't knock it until you've tried it.
Come on, get closer.

27:30.236 --> 27:33.000
Hey, man, this is a helicopter, it makes noise.

27:33.039 --> 27:36.065
They are so preoccupied, they'll never hear us.

27:36.109 --> 27:37.098
Uh-huh.

27:40.713 --> 27:42.772
Come on. Closer.

27:46.185 --> 27:48.176
Closer.

28:09.208 --> 28:10.903
This is great.

28:14.180 --> 28:17.013
To think that some countries still hunt them.

28:17.917 --> 28:19.908
Yeah.

28:24.157 --> 28:28.253
I told you they'd hear us.
What do you think they were doing?

28:28.294 --> 28:31.957
I don't know. Some kind of a mating dance?
Where's Legs' boat?

28:31.998 --> 28:35.559
Don't worry.
They're probably still in their cabin,

28:35.601 --> 28:37.398
doing their mating dance.

28:38.771 --> 28:40.261
What did you expect?

28:40.306 --> 28:43.332
The husband hired you
because he was suspicious.

28:43.376 --> 28:46.834
That doesn't mean he's right.
I was hoping he was wrong.

28:46.879 --> 28:51.839
You know, that Suntan would maybe
turn out to be her long-lost baby brother.

28:52.585 --> 28:56.112
Baby brother?
Man, you are really reaching.

28:57.890 --> 29:00.882
- He's a mean one, huh?
- Who?

29:00.927 --> 29:04.761
- Legs' husband.
- I wouldn't say he's mean exactly.

29:04.797 --> 29:08.893
I can't blame you. It's usually
the bearer of bad tidings that gets buried.

29:10.837 --> 29:13.362
- They came up for air.
- The whales?

29:13.406 --> 29:15.397
No, Legs and Suntan.

29:22.849 --> 29:24.840
- That's great.
- What?

29:24.884 --> 29:28.012
- They're fighting.
- What's so great about that?

29:28.054 --> 29:31.182
Don't you see? It hasn't worked out.

29:31.224 --> 29:33.749
She thought
she could have an affair with Suntan

29:33.793 --> 29:36.660
but now she realizes
she's still in love with Clarence.

29:37.363 --> 29:40.127
- Clarence?
- Yeah, her husband.

29:40.166 --> 29:46.036
She realized a few stolen moments of passion
aren't worth a lifetime of regret.

29:46.072 --> 29:49.303
She was probably
faithful to Clarence all along.

29:50.042 --> 29:53.910
- Do you really believe that?
- That's what I'll tell Clarence.

29:53.946 --> 29:56.506
He is a mean one, huh?

30:01.087 --> 30:05.080
- It's magnificent.
- I'm relieved it's finally in your hands.

30:05.124 --> 30:10.323
I must confess I felt a bit uncomfortable,
carting it about like a delivery boy.

30:10.363 --> 30:14.766
To think I hold the very crown Henry Vlll
placed on Anne Boleyn's head.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.961
And while she still had it, I hope.

30:17.003 --> 30:18.334
What?

30:18.371 --> 30:20.896
Oh, yes. Quite good.

30:22.174 --> 30:24.472
I'm a descendant of Henry's, you know.

30:24.510 --> 30:26.341
- Really?
- Yes.

30:26.379 --> 30:30.475
My father's great grandfather's aunt
was the Duchess of Clyde

30:30.516 --> 30:33.508
whose uncle on her mother's side
was Earl of Westchester,

30:33.553 --> 30:37.455
second cousin to Lord Throckmorton,
the nephew of Edward VI,

30:37.490 --> 30:41.950
who was the only issue of Henry VIII's
third marriage to Jane Seymour.

30:41.994 --> 30:44.929
Oh, yes. Yes. I see.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.394
Oh, thank you.

30:49.435 --> 30:52.427
The Society will be forever
indebted to the Queen Mother

30:52.471 --> 30:56.134
for loaning the tiara to us
to open the wing of the museum

30:56.175 --> 30:59.906
and to you, Brigadier,
for so very kindly delivering it to us.

30:59.946 --> 31:01.709
Nonsense, Sergeant Major,

31:01.747 --> 31:05.012
I was coming out to the islands
on holiday anyway.

31:06.018 --> 31:07.610
To the Queen Mother.

31:07.653 --> 31:09.416
To the Queen Mother.

31:13.492 --> 31:16.984
How did you get Irish
in your Scotch decanter?

31:22.168 --> 31:24.762
Patrick, why the bloody hell did you...

31:28.374 --> 31:31.468
Is something wrong, brother darling?

31:31.510 --> 31:34.843
Did you put Irish whiskey
in my crystal Scotch decanter?

31:34.880 --> 31:38.008
Aye. I did not see any for Irish

31:38.050 --> 31:41.178
and I thought Scotch
would be closer than gin.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.017
You thought Scotch...

31:43.055 --> 31:44.488
Did it cause a problem?

31:44.523 --> 31:47.424
My old brigadier arrived
and we toasted the Queen Mother

31:47.460 --> 31:50.588
- with your bloody Irish whiskey!
- Think nothing of it.

31:50.630 --> 31:54.794
With all you've done for me, sharing
me whiskey with you is the least I can do.

31:55.901 --> 31:59.997
Now, if you'll excuse me, brother darling,

32:00.039 --> 32:02.200
I've me evening vespers to complete.

32:15.354 --> 32:20.724
Forgive me.
Sometimes I just cannot help myself.

32:38.944 --> 32:42.937
That's Clarence?
Boy, no wonder you're terrified.

32:42.982 --> 32:45.143
I'm not terrified.

32:48.988 --> 32:50.478
You should be.

32:52.258 --> 32:55.022
Hi, Clarence. Is your manager here?

32:57.363 --> 33:00.855
Guess not. I just stopped by
to give you the good news.

33:03.703 --> 33:07.366
- Does it talk?
- In one syllable sentences.

33:07.406 --> 33:10.307
- Clarence, this is T.C.
- You ain't got to introduce me.

33:10.342 --> 33:12.037
- He's my partner...
- Partner?

33:12.078 --> 33:14.876
And we decided
that we can just about assure you

33:14.914 --> 33:18.179
that your wife isn't doing anything
you wouldn't want her to do.

33:18.217 --> 33:21.209
- What is with this "we" stuff?
- You get 50%/% of the net.

33:21.253 --> 33:23.619
For what, 50%/% of the bruises?

33:25.257 --> 33:28.590
Clarence, look,
maybe I'd better talk to your manager.

33:28.627 --> 33:30.788
After all, he's the one who hired me. Us.

33:30.830 --> 33:33.924
- I think you'd better tell Clarence.
- Of course.

33:33.966 --> 33:37.458
Well, T.C. and I were
following your wife in a boat.

33:37.503 --> 33:40.097
She was in a boat
and we were in a helicopter.

33:40.139 --> 33:42.733
Well... Hey, we saw some whales.
Two of 'em.

33:42.775 --> 33:46.871
They had their heads in the water
and they were flapping their tails...

33:46.912 --> 33:49.278
I don't think he wants to hear about whales.

33:49.315 --> 33:51.283
- Will you let me tell this?
- Name.

33:53.319 --> 33:55.617
What did he say?

33:55.654 --> 33:58.122
- He wants Suntan's name.
- Well, give it to him!

33:58.157 --> 34:00.455
I can't give it to him, I don't know it.

34:00.493 --> 34:05.192
And you don't have to know it either
because your wife is not having

34:05.231 --> 34:07.222
an affair with Suntan.

34:07.266 --> 34:10.167
As a matter of fact, she hates the guy.

34:10.202 --> 34:13.728
Yeah, that's right. In fact,
when they came out of the cabin...

34:14.373 --> 34:16.034
she was just... Thomas.

34:16.074 --> 34:17.906
See, Clarence, I got this theory.

34:17.943 --> 34:21.674
I think Suntan is a reporter
for one of those trashy scandal sheets

34:21.714 --> 34:24.181
and he's trying to create a story...

34:25.184 --> 34:27.208
That's it! That's enough! I've had it!

34:27.253 --> 34:32.623
You may be able to kill us but I'm not gonna
let you intimidate me any longer.

34:33.391 --> 34:37.260
I apologize for that
but I have an image to uphold.

34:38.130 --> 34:44.159
Mr. Magnum, T.C., Angie - or Legs,
as you have so aptly nicknamed her -

34:44.203 --> 34:48.435
is not only promiscuous,
she's the one who wants the divorce.

34:48.474 --> 34:52.570
She's maintaining this facade of faithfulness
until I win the championship,

34:52.610 --> 34:54.772
then she's gonna file for a divorce

34:54.813 --> 34:57.942
and if you don't procure proof
of Angie's infidelities,

34:57.983 --> 35:01.111
then I'll have to give her
half of my share in the purse.

35:01.153 --> 35:03.314
That could be a couple of million dollars,

35:03.355 --> 35:07.018
so please, gentlemen,
ferret out Suntan's real name

35:07.059 --> 35:10.187
and find me some acceptable evidence.

35:15.167 --> 35:18.000
I can't imagine what's delaying my half-brother.

35:18.037 --> 35:20.505
I'm in such a flutter, Jonathan.

35:20.539 --> 35:24.635
Think of it, the opening of
the Queen Mother's wing at the museum

35:24.677 --> 35:28.670
and meeting your own flesh and blood,
all in the same week.

35:28.714 --> 35:31.046
It's almost more than one can bear.

35:32.852 --> 35:34.843
Yes, quite.

35:34.887 --> 35:39.950
You said your brother was part Irish.
What part of Ireland does he come from?

35:39.992 --> 35:42.688
Northern, Brigadier Ffolkes.

35:42.728 --> 35:44.719
Northern.

35:44.763 --> 35:47.357
- Father McGuinness?
- You two know each other?

35:47.399 --> 35:51.495
Aye, brother darling, the Brigadier and I
are old acquaintances.

35:51.537 --> 35:54.665
Isn't this a wonderful coincidence?

35:54.707 --> 35:58.199
The Lord works in mysterious ways, lass.

35:58.244 --> 36:02.044
Not this mysterious, I fancy.
What are you up to, Father?

36:02.081 --> 36:04.276
It's quite simple, Brigadier.

36:04.817 --> 36:08.309
You stole the ashes of the Crozier
of St Patrick from me poor church

36:08.354 --> 36:09.412
and I want 'em back.

36:09.455 --> 36:12.219
Patrick, apologize to the Brigadier at once.

36:12.258 --> 36:14.556
No, that's not necessary, Sergeant Major,

36:14.593 --> 36:18.791
because I haven't the faintest idea
what the good Father's talking about.

36:18.831 --> 36:20.822
Well, you'd better, Brigadier,

36:20.866 --> 36:24.358
or you'll never see the tiara fat Henry crowned
his tart with again.

36:48.326 --> 36:51.818
<i>After leaving Clarence, it took T.C.
and me an hour to realize</i>

36:51.863 --> 36:54.991
<i>we were walking around
with our mouths still hanging open.</i>

36:55.033 --> 36:57.331
<i>So we drove to the club
where Rick closed them</i>

36:57.368 --> 37:01.395
<i>with a couple of steaks
and a bottle of Bordeaux on the house.</i>

37:01.439 --> 37:04.101
<i>Of course, there was a price to pay</i>.

37:04.142 --> 37:06.610
<i>Rick was still laughing when we left</i>.

37:09.214 --> 37:12.012
You used me, your own half-brother!

37:12.817 --> 37:16.878
- I'm sorry about that, brother darling.
- Stop calling me that.

37:16.921 --> 37:20.186
I suppose I shouldn't
blame you for being upset.

37:20.225 --> 37:21.783
Upset! Upset!

37:21.826 --> 37:25.489
Jonathan, your blood pressure.

37:25.530 --> 37:27.521
Of course...

37:29.100 --> 37:31.568
you wouldn't have been involved...

37:33.338 --> 37:37.240
if I hadn't met that big strapping friend
of yours at the airport.

37:38.076 --> 37:39.441
Magnum.

37:41.045 --> 37:45.880
Why didn't you report this theft
to the police in Armagh?

37:45.917 --> 37:49.409
- How do you know I didn't?
- Because I'd have been informed.

37:49.454 --> 37:53.288
To tell you the truth, Brigadier,
the Bishop told me to

37:53.324 --> 37:56.452
but I got to thinking, going to the police

37:56.494 --> 38:00.794
would be like the mouse going to the cat
to tell him the dog stole the cheese.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.663
So you decided to steal the tiara instead?

38:05.703 --> 38:06.897
Tit for tat.

38:06.938 --> 38:09.634
And we're to believe
that this is all a coincidence?

38:09.674 --> 38:15.340
That the ashes of the Crozier disappeared,
or were stolen from your church

38:15.380 --> 38:19.214
just a few days before I was
to escort the tiara to Hawaii.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.242
The creator moves in mysterious ways.

38:22.287 --> 38:25.779
- So does the IRA, Father.
- And what do you mean by that?

38:25.823 --> 38:29.156
It's obvious that the IRA
has orchestrated this whole incident

38:29.193 --> 38:33.653
to besmirch the reputation of
the British soldier in Northern Ireland.

38:33.698 --> 38:37.361
You don't need the IRA to do that.

38:37.402 --> 38:41.361
Do you really expect anybody to believe
that we would steal a church relic?

38:41.406 --> 38:45.206
Who, pray tell, burned the Crozier
of St Patrick in the first place?

38:45.243 --> 38:47.837
That was 500 years ago.

38:47.879 --> 38:50.177
When are you bloody Irish going to forget?

38:50.214 --> 38:52.375
When Cromwell gets out of hell!

38:52.417 --> 38:55.750
I'm beginning to see
why Northern Ireland's in such a mess.

38:55.787 --> 38:58.085
Magnum, this is all your fault.

38:58.122 --> 39:00.420
Good, then you won't mind if I butt in.

39:00.458 --> 39:04.451
- Good evening, everybody.
- You've no idea what's involved here.

39:04.495 --> 39:08.158
Well, I think I may have
heard enough to give me a clue.

39:08.199 --> 39:12.829
Father Paddy thinks that the British here
have stolen a relic from his church

39:12.870 --> 39:16.966
and the British think that Father Paddy
is part of an IRA plot to discredit them.

39:17.008 --> 39:18.669
Is that close enough?

39:18.710 --> 39:22.908
Well, I figure you're both wrong.

39:22.947 --> 39:24.437
Thank you, Agatha.

39:24.482 --> 39:27.918
I have known the Brigadier here
for several years.

39:27.952 --> 39:31.854
Not well but well enough to know that
he would shoot you in the line of duty

39:31.889 --> 39:34.050
but he wouldn't steal your shoes.

39:34.092 --> 39:37.027
Rather crudely put, but thank you.

39:37.061 --> 39:40.929
And although I don't know Father Paddy
any better, I do know his brother.

39:40.965 --> 39:42.489
Half-brother.

39:42.967 --> 39:45.094
Half-brother.

39:47.138 --> 39:50.266
Thank you. I assume
the same blood runs in their veins,

39:50.308 --> 39:52.299
therefore they share the same traits.

39:52.343 --> 39:56.177
Higgins would rather be drawn
and quartered than tell a lie.

39:57.382 --> 40:00.909
- Besides, despite Father Paddy's vices...
- Vices?

40:01.986 --> 40:05.786
He is a man of the cloth
and I don't think they take to lying too easily.

40:05.823 --> 40:08.121
So what's your point, Magnum?

40:09.360 --> 40:14.423
My point is that if you two could bury
your chauvinistic hatchets for a minute,

40:14.465 --> 40:17.730
the two of you together
might be able to figure out

40:17.769 --> 40:20.533
who else could have benefited
by stealing the relic.

40:20.571 --> 40:23.096
Good night and thanks for the cigar.

40:31.949 --> 40:34.247
Isn't this exciting?

40:34.285 --> 40:37.083
Just like an Agatha Christie novel.

40:37.121 --> 40:42.115
Now, all we have to do
is to figure out who did it.

40:48.032 --> 40:50.398
We'll be leaving here at seven o'clock sharp

40:50.435 --> 40:54.201
for a delightful breakfast
at the Hog & Hound

40:54.238 --> 40:56.706
followed by a tour of the countryside

40:56.741 --> 41:00.074
where you'll see the ruins
of the abbey of Loughgall,

41:00.111 --> 41:04.571
the old wall at Concannon and...

41:04.615 --> 41:11.544
I'm afraid we'll have to cross
the Crozier of St Patrick's off our itinerary

41:11.589 --> 41:15.457
as the ashes are no longer there.

41:16.327 --> 41:18.318
The church was a little out of our way

41:18.362 --> 41:21.854
but I selected a lovely little church
here in Armagh.

41:21.899 --> 41:25.892
So have a lovely evening
and do be on time in the morning.

41:25.937 --> 41:27.802
May we have a word with you, Miss?

41:27.839 --> 41:30.000
Yes, there's plenty of room on the tour bus.

41:30.041 --> 41:34.000
- A full day's tour is five pounds...
- We're not interested in the tour, Miss.

41:34.045 --> 41:37.708
We'd like to discuss the ashes
of St Patrick's Crozier.

41:40.551 --> 41:42.542
<i>Confronted by the constabulary,</i>

41:42.587 --> 41:46.250
<i>the tour guide broke down and led them
to where she'd hidden the relic.</i>

41:46.290 --> 41:49.782
<i>Hearing of its safe return,
Father Paddy gave the tiara to Higgins</i>

41:49.827 --> 41:52.295
<i>and, in a conciliatory gesture,</i>

41:52.330 --> 41:55.356
<i>insisted on flying home with the Brigadier</i>.

41:55.399 --> 41:58.891
<i>All I could think was
God help the passengers.</i>

41:58.936 --> 42:01.234
And what about the plantation of Ireland?

42:01.272 --> 42:04.173
Father McGuinness,
do you realize when that happened?

42:04.208 --> 42:06.733
Aye, with the coming
of the crossbow in 1169.

42:06.777 --> 42:09.302
How can you hold us
responsible for something

42:09.347 --> 42:10.871
that happened 800 years ago?

42:10.915 --> 42:15.011
That's the trouble with you Brits,
you have too short a memory.

42:15.987 --> 42:18.888
Sergeant Major,
I shall see you on my next visit, I hope.

42:18.923 --> 42:20.220
So do I, sir.

42:22.593 --> 42:25.061
I always seem to end up in your debt.

42:25.096 --> 42:27.690
Better than the other way around.
Goodbye, sir.

42:32.770 --> 42:36.433
Don't you go taking
too many of those divorce cases.

42:36.474 --> 42:38.635
It'll sour you on marrying.

42:38.676 --> 42:40.974
I'll try and remember that, Father.

42:43.915 --> 42:47.578
17 years is a long time.

42:48.519 --> 42:50.180
Yes, it is.

42:51.422 --> 42:54.914
- If you're ever in Northern Ireland...
- I'll call first.

43:03.668 --> 43:06.796
It's been grand seeing you.

43:06.837 --> 43:08.668
You too...

43:09.874 --> 43:11.865
brother.

43:16.881 --> 43:18.815
God bless you, brother darling.

43:40.071 --> 43:43.063
You know, we ought
to have a family reunion,

43:43.107 --> 43:45.575
get all of Dad's kids together.

43:45.610 --> 43:49.102
You, me, Elmo, Soo-Ling.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.876
Soo-Ling?

44:00.224 --> 44:03.557
I don't suppose you'd have
the decency to drop it.

44:07.031 --> 44:09.022
That's what I thought.

44:10.901 --> 44:15.565
In 1928, my father was military attaché
to the embassy in Peking.

44:15.606 --> 44:19.064
He was asked to escort a contingent
of Episcopal nuns to Hentiy,

44:19.110 --> 44:21.101
where they were to establish a mission.

44:21.145 --> 44:24.080
Along the way, they were ambushed
by Mongolian bandits

44:24.115 --> 44:26.709
led by a beautiful, raven-haired woman.

44:26.751 --> 44:30.847
She had never seen an Englishman before
and found my father fascinating,

44:30.888 --> 44:34.016
so fascinating that she was willing
to let the nuns go on

44:34.058 --> 44:37.994
in exchange for certain favors, so to speak.

44:38.929 --> 44:43.332
<i>She took my father to a cliff
overlooking the sea and...</i>

44:43.367 --> 44:45.198
What is she doing to him now?

44:46.037 --> 44:47.527
Snap off a couple.

44:47.571 --> 44:50.039
How do we prove
Clarence's wife is unfaithful

44:50.074 --> 44:52.235
with us taking pictures of her fighting?

44:52.276 --> 44:54.437
I don't know. Just snap a couple.

45:02.186 --> 45:04.017
I don't know how Thomas does this.

45:04.055 --> 45:06.819
Can you imagine spending
all your time doing this?

45:06.857 --> 45:09.382
- Maybe it gets interesting.
- When?

45:09.427 --> 45:11.122
What are they doing now?

45:11.162 --> 45:14.893
What they've been doing
for the last 30 minutes - arguing.

45:14.932 --> 45:16.866
Some pair of lovebirds.

45:16.901 --> 45:20.029
I had a relationship like that once,
fought all the time.

45:20.071 --> 45:23.563
Man, it was terrible... until we made up.

45:23.607 --> 45:26.735
Yeah, well, these two ain't
never gonna make up.

45:26.777 --> 45:30.873
They'd better or else Clarence won't
stand a chance in divorce court.

45:33.317 --> 45:34.682
This is boring.

45:34.719 --> 45:36.914
Maybe something interesting'll happen.

45:36.954 --> 45:38.888
- Like what?
- I don't know.

45:38.923 --> 45:42.882
Whenever Thomas has a case,
you can never tell what'll happen.
