USE THE VETO ON RICKY.

38:45.310 --> 38:48.379
RICKY OUT OF HERE.

38:48.413 --> 38:52.068
BUT I'M EXCITED THAT HE SEES
THINGS MY WAY AND IS KEEPING

38:52.103 --> 38:53.551
NATALIE ON THE BLOCK.

38:53.586 --> 38:57.068

HER.

40:16.758 --> 40:18.655
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN MY
POSITION?

40:18.689 --> 40:24.827
>> I WOULD GO TALK TO DINA AND I
WOULD TALK TO RICK.

40:24.862 --> 40:27.620
ASK THEM STRAIGHT UP, "DO I HAVE
YOUR VOTE OR NOT?

40:27.655 --> 40:29.034
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO STAY.

40:29.068 --> 40:30.551

THEY PETITIONED AGAINST HER?

40:45.000 --> 40:49.034
>> YOU'RE NOT PETITIONING
AGAINST HER.

40:49.068 --> 40:49.896
YOU'RE ASKING DO YOU HAVE VOTES?

40:49.931 --> 40:52.724
>> I'M ASSUMING I WOULD HAVE
YOUR VOTE.

40:52.758 --> 40:56.034

FEEL LIKE WE REALLY CAN CONNECT.

1:20:08.896 --> 1:20:09.413
IT WAS INTENSE.

1:20:09.448 --> 1:20:10.482
>> OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH.

1:20:10.517 --> 1:20:12.551
>> Julie: OUT OF EVERYONE
LEFT IN THE GAME, ARE YOU

1:20:12.586 --> 1:20:14.482
ROOTING FOR-- WHO ARE YOU
ROOTING FOR RIGHT NOW?

1:20:14.517 --> 1:20:19.931
>> YOU KNOW, I-- I THINK I WOULD
SAY THAT I AM VOTING FOR LOLO.

1:20:19.965 --> 1:20:20.620
YUP.

1:20:20.655 --> 1:20:21.034
>> Julie: I DIDN'T SAY VOTE.

1:20:21.068 --> 1:20:22.000
I SAID ROOTING.

1:20:22.034 --> 1:20:25.068
>> ROOTING, ROOTING, ROOTING.

1:20:25.103 --> 1:20:26.517
>> Julie: THINGS COULD
CHANGE.

1:20:26.551 --> 1:20:28.034
>> ROOTING.

1:20:28.068 --> 1:20:30.620
SORRY, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE I'M
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

1:20:30.655 --> 1:20:31.586
>> Julie: I KNOW.

1:20:31.620 --> 1:20:34.000
>> I DON'T THINK I EVEN HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID.

1:20:34.034 --> 1:20:37.000
I WAS LIKE, "OH, LOOK, THERE ARE
PEOPLE.

1:20:37.034 --> 1:20:38.413
>> Julie: YOU WERE ON A ROLL.

1:20:38.448 --> 1:20:42.137
YOU WENT FROM BEING H.O.H., THE
VETO WINNER, EVICTEE.

1:20:42.172 --> 1:20:45.689
WHAT DO YOU-- IN YOUR WORDS,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR GAME?

1:20:45.724 --> 1:20:46.931
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

1:20:46.965 --> 1:20:49.275
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I FELT LIKE
THE ODDS WERE A LITTLE AGAINST

1:20:49.310 --> 1:20:50.655
ME IN THE BEGINNING.

1:20:50.689 --> 1:20:56.379
I MADE CLOSE SORT OF ALLIANCE
WITH ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, THE

1:20:56.413 --> 1:21:00.310
MOOCH, AND KATO, AND WHEN HE
LEFT SUDDENLY IT WAS ME AND

1:21:00.344 --> 1:21:00.758
KATO.

1:21:00.793 --> 1:21:02.034
WE WERE OUR OWN.

1:21:02.068 --> 1:21:05.965
YOU KNOW, SO I HAD TO FIGHT FOR
THOSE COMPETITION, WON H.O.H.

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.241
TWICE.

1:21:07.275 --> 1:21:09.689
IT WAS-- I THINK THAT'S PRETTY
COOL TO SAY-- NOW I CAN SAY NOT

1:21:09.724 --> 1:21:12.172
ONLY HAVE I BEEN ON "BIG
BROTHER."

1:21:12.206 --> 1:21:13.482
I'VE WON H.O.H. TWICE.

1:21:13.517 --> 1:21:15.068
I'VE WON TWO VETOES.

1:21:15.103 --> 1:21:18.241
BUT THEY THINK KIND OF CAUSED A
LITTLE BIT OF DRAMA IN THE

1:21:18.275 --> 1:21:19.448
HOUSE.

1:21:19.482 --> 1:21:23.931
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, WHEN THEY KNOW
YOU HAD THAT-- THAT H.O.H.

1:21:23.965 --> 1:21:27.793
POWER, YOU KNOW, REALLY I THINK
IT MADE SOME PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT

1:21:27.827 --> 1:21:29.000
SCARED.

1:21:29.034 --> 1:21:30.551
>> Julie: WHEN YOU BONDED
WITH KATO IN THE HOUSE, THE TWO

1:21:30.586 --> 1:21:33.965
OF YOU DECIDED TO TARGET ALL THE
MEN.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:35.206
WHY TAKE THAT STRATEGY?

1:21:35.241 --> 1:21:40.517
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, HINDSIGHT IS
20/20.

1:21:40.551 --> 1:21:44.275
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD DO THAT
KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW.

1:21:44.310 --> 1:21:46.206
BUT --
>> BUT AT THE TIME, WHY?

1:21:46.241 --> 1:21:50.241
>> AT THE TIME, THEY HAD SORT
OF-- EVERYONE GOES OFF INTO

1:21:50.275 --> 1:21:56.034
THEIR LITTLE CLIQUES, AND WHEN
ANTHONY LEFT, I KIND OF REALIZED

1:21:56.068 --> 1:21:58.931
THAT, YOU KNOW, JOEY AND
JONATHAN AND RYAN WERE KIND OF

1:21:58.965 --> 1:22:02.103
OFF IN THEIR ELECTION SECTION,
AND IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE IN

1:22:02.137 --> 1:22:04.896
AN ALLIANCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE
AND NOT US AND IT FELT LIKE THEY

1:22:04.931 --> 1:22:07.068
WERE AGAINST US SO WE WENT
AGAINST THEM.

1:22:07.103 --> 1:22:11.103
>> Julie: YOU PLAYED THIS
HARD PUP PLAYED IT PRETTY GOOD.

1:22:11.137 --> 1:22:12.448
YOU WON COMPETITIONS.

1:22:12.482 --> 1:22:14.724
WHAT'S THE BEST THING YOU'RE
TAKING AWAY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE

1:22:14.758 --> 1:22:15.965
IN THE HOUSE?

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:20.241
>> YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK THAT I
LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE WAY

1:22:20.275 --> 1:22:20.758
HUMANS BEHAVE.

1:22:20.793 --> 1:22:21.896
>> Julie: WHICH IS?

1:22:21.931 --> 1:22:25.206
>> WE REALLY DO-- YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE REALLY CHANGE VERY

1:22:25.241 --> 1:22:31.482
QUICKLY ON A DIME WHEN SOMEBODY
WINS A COMPETITION, ALL OF A

1:22:31.517 --> 1:22:34.517
SUDDEN YOUR BEST FRIEND ONE DAY
IS YOUR WORST ENEMY THE NEXT.

1:22:34.551 --> 1:22:38.275
AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF A SAD
THING TO LEARN, BUT, ALSO, I

1:22:38.310 --> 1:22:40.482
THINK I'LL CARRY THAT WITH ME IN
LIFE.

1:22:40.517 --> 1:22:45.965
AND HOPEFULLY, BE ABLE TO USE IT
IN SOME WAY WHEN NAVIGATING

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.448
THROUGH THIS CRAZY WORLD WE'RE
FLIFG.

1:22:48.482 --> 1:22:49.241
SO.

1:22:49.275 --> 1:22:49.758
>> Julie: TOM, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.

1:22:49.793 --> 1:22:50.758

POWERFUL HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD OF

1:23:50.758 --> 1:23:56.344
THAT IS BECAUSE THIS H.O.H. WILL

1:23:56.379 --> 1:24:01.379
HOUSEGUESTS, AND IN DOING SO,
CHOOSE WHO HE OR SHE WANTS TO BE
