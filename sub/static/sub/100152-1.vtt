WEBVTT

00:10.260 --> 00:14.806
I believe that this nation should
commit itself to achieving the goal

00:14.890 --> 00:18.393
before this decade is out
of landing a man on the moon

00:18.477 --> 00:20.521
and returning him safely to the Earth.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.192
I don't think that we can exaggerate
the great advantage

00:25.275 --> 00:29.613
which the Soviet Union secured in the '50s
by being first in space.

00:30.739 --> 00:34.701
They were able to give prestige
to their system.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.788
They were able to give force
to their argument

00:37.871 --> 00:39.581
that they were an advancing society...

00:39.665 --> 00:40.707
[cheering, applause]

00:41.208 --> 00:42.709
...and that we were on the decline.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.587
[protesters shouting, clamoring]

00:47.422 --> 00:50.259
Our great system will be judged

00:50.342 --> 00:52.719
by how we do in the field of space...

00:54.263 --> 00:55.806
and therefore this country.

00:56.765 --> 01:01.436
Both political parties have determined
that the United States shall be first.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.986
Quite obviously, if we fail,
we're humiliated,

01:09.069 --> 01:10.654
here and around the world.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.662

01:27.462 --> 01:29.631
[man, in Spanish]
Aleida, my dear. Your mamma wants you.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.970
[man speaks Spanish]

01:35.053 --> 01:38.765
[TV anchor, in English] Still no further
word on the progress of the spacecraft

01:38.849 --> 01:40.475
toward the surface of the moon.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.938
But we believe that
it will be touching down any minute now.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.524
The last official report we have said

01:47.608 --> 01:49.776
that the landing vehicle was descending
toward the surface...

01:49.860 --> 01:51.111
Mama.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.280
[in Spanish]
How long do we have to watch this?

01:53.363 --> 01:54.364
Shh.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.825
They just talk, talk, talk...

01:56.909 --> 01:59.369
Aleida. This is special.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.748
You'll remember this
the rest of your life.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.626
This is the beginning of the future.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.753
You can be part of that.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.297
Maybe even go to the moon one day.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.298
[man speaks Spanish]

02:11.381 --> 02:13.550
You should be in bed.
The doctor says you need rest--

02:13.634 --> 02:15.719
Never mind the doctor.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.638
I want to be here for this.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.640
With her.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.017
So she'll remember.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.644
[TV anchor]
...the spacecraft has landed.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.980
Can we confirm that?

02:27.648 --> 02:28.857
Yes.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.193
They are on the moon,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:34.071 --> 02:37.449
Radio and television signals from the moon

02:37.533 --> 02:40.536
take less than two seconds
to reach us here on Earth.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.704
So if we do get television pictures,

02:42.788 --> 02:45.832
they'll be essentially broadcasting live.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.960
That's right.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.837
Live from the moon.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.934
In the United Kingdom, we're told
that Queen Elizabeth II was awakened...

03:04.017 --> 03:05.769
[door opens, closes]

03:05.853 --> 03:09.231
...when first reports
of the pending moon landing was received.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.358
And in Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito...

03:11.441 --> 03:13.569
Are they down?
The radio wasn't sure if they landed or--

03:13.652 --> 03:15.237
They're down. They're down.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.656
There's no video yet, but they're down.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.534
At the Vatican, Pope Paul VI positioned--

03:20.617 --> 03:23.328
[man on radio] One of the most shocking
events of my lifetime.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.748
This will shake things up in this country.
I'll tell you that right now.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.458
Things will never be the same.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.441
...are little more than guesswork.

03:52.524 --> 03:56.111
But experts have long anticipated
a possible viewership

03:56.195 --> 03:58.697
of over 500 million people.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.199
Is this really happening?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.203
I'm hearing we're getting a picture.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.164
Is that right? We have a picture?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.249
Sid, can we patch into...

04:10.417 --> 04:11.835
Got it.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a live signal from the moon.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.091
Having some trouble seeing it.

04:19.635 --> 04:22.429
Uh... There, I see it. There it is.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.140
Amazing.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.976
Just unbelievable.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.147
The shock across the nation at this event.

04:32.231 --> 04:37.778
Indeed, the shock across the world
is just indescribable.

04:37.861 --> 04:41.281
What was considered a fantasy
just a short time ago

04:41.365 --> 04:44.159
is coming true right before our eyes.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.244
[whispering]

04:45.327 --> 04:49.289
I believe we're looking at the legs
of the lunar lander.

04:50.165 --> 04:54.753
There at the bottom of your screen
is what appears to be a ladder.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.590
No word yet on when someone will be
climbing down that ladder, but--

04:58.674 --> 05:01.134
Wait, wait. Here we go.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.427
I see something.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.681
There he is. We have him.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.684
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.103
Can you believe it?

05:12.145 --> 05:15.399
After thousands of years,
ladies and gentlemen,

05:15.482 --> 05:18.735
gazing up in the heavens
and dreaming of this day,

05:19.736 --> 05:23.282
a man is about to set foot on the moon.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.580
[cosmonaut speaking Russian]

05:39.214 --> 05:42.134
Don't know what he's saying, obviously,

05:42.217 --> 05:45.304
but we'll get a translation of his words,

05:46.180 --> 05:50.517
man's first words from the moon,
in just a minute.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.356
Okay, we have the translation now,

05:56.440 --> 06:01.695
and these are the words
that Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov,

06:01.778 --> 06:04.448
the first man to set foot on the moon,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.408
spoke just moments ago.

06:06.992 --> 06:10.913
"I take this step for my country,
for my people,

06:10.996 --> 06:14.208
and for the Marxist-Leninist way of life.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.294
Knowing that today is but one small step

06:17.377 --> 06:22.007
on a journey that someday
will take us all to the stars."

06:30.265 --> 06:31.934
I'm not sure what to say.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.478
Perhaps there are no words.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.147
So, for now,

06:37.231 --> 06:39.816
we'll let you soak in
this historic moment...

06:41.193 --> 06:44.279
and reflect on what it means
for our country...

06:45.489 --> 06:47.074
and for the world.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.955
[Richard Nixon]
How the hell did this happen?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.918
Those bastards at NASA have been acting
like they had everything under control,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.003
and then they fumble the ball
right at the goddamn goal line.

08:23.086 --> 08:23.921
Right at the goal!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.797
Yes, sir, it sure looks that way.

08:25.881 --> 08:29.426
CIA is working up a review of their intel
over the last year

08:29.510 --> 08:31.720
to see if they missed any signs
of Soviet advances that--

08:31.803 --> 08:33.472
[Nixon] They missed
the whole goddamn thing!

08:33.554 --> 08:34.890
The whole match!

08:34.972 --> 08:36.808
You know how the press is gonna play this,
don't you?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.477
The New York Times is going to say that

08:38.558 --> 08:40.145
Kennedy started the moon race,

08:40.354 --> 08:41.188
Johnson ran it,

08:41.270 --> 08:42.981
and then Nixon tripped at the goal line.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.024
That's what it's gonna be.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.777
They're gonna try and hang this
around my neck,

08:47.277 --> 08:48.278
but they're not gonna succeed.

08:48.570 --> 08:49.363
No, sir.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.156
I'll tell you that right goddamn now.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.616
Not Nixon.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.967
Shane, let's go.
Shake a leg. Bus is almost here.

-I mean, yes, sir.
-That's right.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.524
[Shane] They shoulda let you land,

09:26.358 --> 09:27.776
then we woulda been first.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.864
[chuckles]

09:31.947 --> 09:34.575
Yeah. Well, that wasn't my mission, buddy.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.619
Hey. Here's your lunch, okay?

09:37.703 --> 09:39.288
-Let's get going.
-Thank you.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.664
Hey, you have a good day, okay?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.249
-Yeah. Bye, Dad.
-Bye-bye.

Love you, sweetie. Have a good day.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.336
-Thank you.
-Okay.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.636
So, how do you think
it's gonna affect the program?

09:56.638 --> 09:59.266
I don't know. Deke's called
an all-hands meeting this morning.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.351
So, I guess we'll find out then.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.690
I hope they still fly Apollo 15.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.984
Yeah. [kisses]

10:11.403 --> 10:13.864

to save this or toss it?

10:13.947 --> 10:14.948
Toss it.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.202
Okay.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.411

11:46.164 --> 11:49.084
Apollo 11 is scheduled to fly
in two and a half weeks.

11:49.168 --> 11:53.589
Neil, Buzz, Mike and their backup crew
will continue training as planned.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.632
Beyond that,
there's been no word from the top.

11:55.716 --> 12:00.929
So, training for Apollos 12 to 20
will also continue as planned...

12:02.264 --> 12:03.599
but not today.

12:07.853 --> 12:10.480
I was at the Cape
with the rest of the Mercury astronauts

12:10.564 --> 12:15.152
when Jim Webb came down and told us
the Russians put the first man in space.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.280
Webb wanted us
to put a good face on for the press.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.241
So we did, but not for a while.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.911
First, we had to be pissed off,

12:23.994 --> 12:25.370
and we were.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.124
Gus could hardly speak. And Al...

12:30.000 --> 12:31.668
Glad Al Shepard's not here today.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.630
Al was really pissed. Even Glenn.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.131
Yes, believe it or not, gentlemen,

12:36.215 --> 12:38.383
John Glenn actually said the word "fuck."

12:38.467 --> 12:39.885
[laughter]

12:44.139 --> 12:47.392
So before we go back to work,
it's time to be pissed!

12:49.603 --> 12:52.481
All training evolutions for today
have been canceled.

12:54.316 --> 12:58.737
I suggest you all take the weekend
to go out, get drunk,

12:58.820 --> 13:01.114
kick your dog,
gnash your teeth, howl at the moon,

13:01.198 --> 13:03.200
or do whatever suits your purpose.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.996
Come Monday morning...

13:12.125 --> 13:13.335
we're back to work.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.297

We at NASA were given no indication
the Soviets were so close to a landing.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.983
The intelligence provided by the CIA
was faulty and inaccurate.

of the Soviet N-1 rocket.

One launch in January,
and then one this past week.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.411

in our intel reports to you.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.288

We said we had a 95% confidence level
the January vehicle was unmanned.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.920
But we only had 80% confidence
on the second launch.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.588

that our technology is vastly superior

The vehicle could be ready,

17:08.278 --> 17:10.030
but the phase of the moon
would not be correct.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.324
The phase of the moon? Come on.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.617
He's right.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.827
If the phase of the moon is not correct,

17:15.911 --> 17:18.204
there won't be enough light
on the surface.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.374
And we cannot land in darkness.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.376
Shit.

17:23.416 --> 17:27.130
Our program is much more robust,
more capable in every way.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.968
We will not only match the Soviets,
we will surpass them.

17:31.927 --> 17:36.306
NASA is prepared to extend
manned exploration beyond the moon.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.269
Mankind's journey into the cosmos
has only just begun.

17:40.352 --> 17:41.854
-[clamoring]
-Yes?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.606
Deke, just last month you sent Apollo 10
all the way to the moon

17:44.690 --> 17:47.276
for what you called a "dress rehearsal"
for the landing.

17:48.110 --> 17:51.196
But Ed Baldwin and Gordo Stevens
actually piloted the lunar module

17:51.280 --> 17:53.991
down to within eight miles of the surface.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.284
They were so close.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.910
Why didn't they just land?

17:56.994 --> 17:59.371
If they had, we'd have beaten the Russians
by a full month.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.832
Landing wasn't in the mission plan.

18:01.915 --> 18:06.336
Apollo 10 was intended to test equipment
and procedures for the actual landing.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.921
And it was a complete success.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.090
But they could've landed, right?

18:10.716 --> 18:11.884
They could've been first.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.596
An American, Edward Baldwin,
could have been the first man on the moon.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.097
No, this is not true.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.517
There was insufficient fuel
for such an attempt.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.187
And the spacecraft weighed too much
for a landing.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.189
It was never considered. Never.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.440
Yes?

18:26.523 --> 18:27.733
[chattering]

18:27.816 --> 18:29.610
[rock 'n' roll playing on jukebox]

18:29.693 --> 18:30.694
[man] How we doin'?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.495
George, good to see ya.

18:40.579 --> 18:41.663
-How ya feelin'?
-Hey.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.751
How we doing today, fellas? Huh?

18:45.834 --> 18:48.504
Not at all? You don't have a comment
at all about any of this?

18:48.587 --> 18:49.588
No comment.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.465
-Zero?
-Zero comment.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.300
-That's...
-What's there to talk about?

18:53.383 --> 18:55.010
[reporter] I couldn't think of a thing.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.429
All right, I'll buy the next round,
okay? Thanks.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.099
What's up, big man?

19:01.934 --> 19:03.769
-Hey, how we doing today?
-Good, man.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.896
Good to see you again. Good to see you.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.314
-It's kinda shitty.
-Kinda shitty. Right.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.149
That's what I've been hearing
from everyone else.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.234
Can you give me something?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.361
You don't need that.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.488
Well, what about you two?

19:14.571 --> 19:17.741
Any thoughts from the crew of Apollo 10
on this dark day?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.202
Not a one.
We're just here blowing off some steam.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.746
Come on. You guys were pretty close.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.874
Got eight miles above the surface.

19:26.959 --> 19:30.546
So close you just reach out
and grab a handful of moondust.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.923
[reporter] And then NASA decides
to bring you home.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.342
That must sting.

19:37.636 --> 19:38.637
Don't matter.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.098
[mutters]

19:42.474 --> 19:45.060
That was our mission.
It was a practice run.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.353
Dress rehearsal.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.689
Wasted opportunity?

19:51.775 --> 19:52.901
Wouldn't go that far.

19:53.819 --> 19:57.114
Well, you were there. Are you saying
there wasn't an opportunity to land?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.699
Not in the mission plan.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.452
Yeah, okay. Fair enough.
But in retrospect, should it have been?

20:02.536 --> 20:04.121
I mean, knowing what you know now,

20:04.204 --> 20:07.082
wouldn't the smart move have been
for Apollo 10 to land on the moon?

20:12.838 --> 20:14.089
It's not a matter of smarts.

20:15.716 --> 20:16.717
Yeah.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.761
Yeah, I guess not.
NASA's full of smart people.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.931
[sighs] Of course,
I guess it's a moot point

20:23.015 --> 20:26.560
since there wasn't enough fuel on board,
and the LEM was too heavy to land anyway.

20:26.643 --> 20:27.811
Bunch of bullshit.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.897
Snoopy was heavier than Eagle.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.857
Had a little less fuel.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.776
But all that means is we woulda had
a little narrower safety margin

20:34.860 --> 20:36.403
if we'd gone for the landing.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.488
-Ain't that right, Ed?
-That's a fact.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.033
[Gordo] I gotta hit the head.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.584
[reporter sighs]

20:50.667 --> 20:52.711
So, Ed,

20:52.794 --> 20:54.796
if you had the right equipment

20:54.880 --> 20:56.548
and you had the opportunity,

20:56.632 --> 20:58.717
and NASA is full of smart people,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.677
what I can't figure is...

21:02.054 --> 21:06.808
why they didn't have the guts
to let you land.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.519
-[scoffs]
-Huh?

21:08.602 --> 21:10.020
You got some balls, man.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.396
I'm just saying.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.441
I mean, NASA's always been known
for its willingness to push the envelope.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.079
I wanna just reach down there.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.165
Scoop up a handful of moondust.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.134
Not anymore. [sighs]

21:43.345 --> 21:45.472
Come on. I've been around you guys a lot.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.350
You like being
on the bleeding edge of things.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.185
[Ed] Abort Descent Stage.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.772
Three, two... one...

22:07.703 --> 22:08.871
We used to.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.415
We used to be like that.

22:11.832 --> 22:13.458
I mean, hell, in Mercury and Gemini,

22:13.542 --> 22:17.212
we hung it out there over the edge
every single time we went up.

22:17.296 --> 22:20.048
But those days are over.

22:23.093 --> 22:26.305
You're right.
We don't have guts at NASA anymore...

22:29.641 --> 22:30.809
since the fire.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.104
The Apollo 1 fire.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.067
Okay, I loved those guys, all right. I...

22:40.277 --> 22:43.947
Gus and Roger and Ed...

22:47.409 --> 22:49.786
I think about them every day.
I mean, we all do.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.163
They were good men.

22:52.664 --> 22:56.293
[sighs] That's the thing.
Good men die in test planes all the time.

22:56.376 --> 23:00.797
But we don't change the whole culture
of flight test 'cause good men die.

23:02.299 --> 23:05.010
We still get up there
and push the envelope every single day,

23:05.093 --> 23:06.970
and maybe,

23:07.763 --> 23:10.557
maybe today's the day you don't come back.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.227
We all know that. It's always there.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.896
But we get up there anyway,
and we keep taking the risks.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.858
But we stopped taking risks at NASA.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.740
And that's why we lost the moon.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.251
Thanks, Ed.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.171
[match strikes]

24:05.863 --> 24:06.905
[father] Aleida!

24:07.948 --> 24:09.283
[speaking Spanish]

24:09.366 --> 24:10.784
It's time to go!

24:16.373 --> 24:17.624
[speaking Spanish]

24:21.253 --> 24:22.296
[speaking Spanish]

24:41.982 --> 24:43.734
[alarm beeping]

24:44.610 --> 24:47.029
[astronaut on radio] Houston, Eagle.
We have a program alarm.

24:50.616 --> 24:51.950
It's a 12-02.

24:53.285 --> 24:55.037
Copy that. 12-02.

24:58.457 --> 25:00.584
[CAPCOM] Stand by, Eagle. We're checking.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.838
In the meantime, yaw the antenna
around minus niner, yaw plus 18.

25:04.922 --> 25:07.674
Copy. Minus nine, plus 18.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.644
GUIDO, what's the story with that alarm?

25:18.727 --> 25:21.396
Uh, checking on it, Flight.
Get right back to ya.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.689
[beeping continues]

25:48.882 --> 25:51.718
GUIDO, this is Margo.
I think I recognize that alarm.

25:51.802 --> 25:53.595
It's okay. They can still land.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.557
Margo, you're outta your lane.
This is a GUIDO issue.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.561
I know the code.

26:01.395 --> 26:05.357
Twelve-02 is a program alarm for the AGC
signaling "Executive overflow, no VAC."

26:06.024 --> 26:09.027
The computer is rebooting itself,
but it's not a problem.

26:16.952 --> 26:18.871
Houston, we need a reading on the 12-02.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.623
-GUIDO!
-Still don't have it, Flight.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.963
Okay, I'm calling it.

26:28.922 --> 26:29.923
Abort the landing.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.050
Eagle, Houston, abort.
Repeat. Abort landing.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.611
[footsteps approaching]

27:00.913 --> 27:02.289
The fault is yours.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.750
Why? Because I wasn't in my lane?

27:04.833 --> 27:06.251
Because you hesitated.

27:07.503 --> 27:09.505
I wanted to double-check my answer.

27:09.588 --> 27:11.006
You knew the answer,

27:11.590 --> 27:13.926
you hesitated,
and the landing was aborted.

27:14.426 --> 27:17.471
You're always telling me that
I have to respect the chain of command.

27:17.554 --> 27:18.847
-Yes.
-Well, in this situation,

27:18.931 --> 27:20.224
I felt the chain of command--

27:20.307 --> 27:23.227
No, not "feel."
This is not a place for feelings.

27:23.310 --> 27:25.896
Something is or it is not.
That is science.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.272
It's about fact.

27:27.356 --> 27:31.902
You had the facts on your side,
but you felt intimidated.

27:33.487 --> 27:34.488
Yes?

27:35.948 --> 27:37.115
-Yes?
-Yes.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.869
Well, that is the problem.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.331
You want to be a flight controller,

27:45.040 --> 27:46.917
to be FIDO on a real mission?

27:48.961 --> 27:52.256
Then you must only do
that which advances the work.

27:53.257 --> 27:54.258
Understand?

27:56.885 --> 27:58.762
[inhales deeply]

28:03.934 --> 28:06.895
Yes, Herr Doktor.

28:08.105 --> 28:09.106
Good.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.150
Tell your father
I'm sending something for his birthday,

28:12.234 --> 28:14.528
but he won't get it until after.

28:15.654 --> 28:16.780
I will.

28:16.864 --> 28:19.491
[sighs]

28:19.950 --> 28:21.076
[Deke] "We were right there.

28:21.159 --> 28:25.497
So close you felt like you could reach out
and grab a handful of moondust.

28:25.581 --> 28:27.291
All it would've taken was some guts.

28:27.374 --> 28:29.710
But we don't have guts at NASA anymore.

28:29.793 --> 28:32.379
That's why we didn't beat the Russians
to the moon."

28:38.051 --> 28:40.053
You are in the shit now, my friend.

28:40.804 --> 28:41.930
How deep?

28:42.014 --> 28:43.515
Above your eyeballs.

28:45.559 --> 28:48.896
Von Braun wants you reassigned
to the Apollo Applications Project

28:48.979 --> 28:50.731
effective immediately.

28:50.814 --> 28:52.941
Are you taking me off Apollo 15?

28:53.650 --> 28:56.403
You took you off 15.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.865
Von Braun wanted you
outta the program completely,

28:59.948 --> 29:01.658
but I wouldn't let him go that far.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.456
Apollo Applications.

29:09.333 --> 29:12.503
Apollo Applications is Siberia
with a desk.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.255
I didn't say anything in that article

29:15.339 --> 29:17.508
that you and I haven't talked about
in this very office.

29:17.591 --> 29:20.511
-Jesus Christ.
-We have gotten too timid since the fire.

29:20.594 --> 29:23.430
We should be leaning forward instead
of worrying about every little goddamn--

29:23.514 --> 29:25.015
Pull your head outta your ass, Ed!

29:26.016 --> 29:27.184
Look around!

29:27.684 --> 29:30.646
You wanna cry about Apollo 15?
Let me tell you something.

29:30.729 --> 29:33.273
There may not be an Apollo 12,
much less 15.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.442
What the hell are you talking about?

29:36.860 --> 29:39.196
The country's in shock, Eddie.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.573
Like Pearl Harbor shock.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.326
American people thought
we had this thing in the bag,

29:44.409 --> 29:47.329
then the Russians come along
and snatch it away at the last minute.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.457
Congress is talking about hearings,

29:50.541 --> 29:52.584
the president is looking
for someone to blame,

29:52.668 --> 29:55.420
and you just served up
the whole goddamn agency

29:55.504 --> 29:56.964
for a necktie party.

29:58.632 --> 30:02.427
They really might
cancel everything after 11?

30:03.262 --> 30:05.848
That's usually what happens
when the race is over.

30:05.931 --> 30:07.891
Winner collects their prize,

30:07.975 --> 30:09.351
loser goes home.

30:12.396 --> 30:15.691
[newscaster] Senator Edward Kennedy
of Massachusetts announced today

30:15.774 --> 30:19.736
that he was canceling a weekend party
on Chappaquiddick Island

30:19.820 --> 30:24.616
in order to return to Washington
and confer with congressional leaders

30:24.700 --> 30:26.118
on the need for hearings

30:26.201 --> 30:30.122
into how the United States
lost the race to the moon.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.917
[Nixon] You know what Teddy's
really doing, don't you?

30:34.501 --> 30:36.336
That goddamn pissant's
gonna use these hearings

30:36.420 --> 30:38.255
to grandstand against the administration.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.464
[man] Yep...

30:39.548 --> 30:42.759
[Nixon] Gonna get up there and say
how NASA was bolder under his brother...

30:42.968 --> 30:44.803
How they've lost their edge under Nixon...

30:44.887 --> 30:45.804
[man] Uh-huh.

30:45.888 --> 30:47.347
[Nixon] This is the opening
of the campaign,

30:47.890 --> 30:50.184
Kennedy for President in '72 --
just you watch.

30:50.601 --> 30:52.436
[man] God help us all.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.479
[cheering, applause]

31:01.737 --> 31:03.864
I guess I'll start packing.

31:05.657 --> 31:06.700
Right?

31:07.701 --> 31:10.871
I mean, if you can't fly for NASA,
you'll go back to the navy.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.666
I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

31:16.126 --> 31:17.794
Well, are you gonna sit behind a desk?

31:20.297 --> 31:21.882
-Hell no.
-Exactly.

31:21.965 --> 31:24.885
So, you'll go back to the navy,
which means we're moving.

31:24.968 --> 31:27.137
The next question now is where.

31:28.722 --> 31:31.016
[sighs] I don't know,
are you gonna ask for Pax River?

31:31.099 --> 31:33.268
I mean, Maryland's fine.

31:34.186 --> 31:35.354
It beats Texas, I suppose.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.814
I'm sure that Shane will grow to love it.

31:38.732 --> 31:41.360
Look, I doubt they're gonna have
an open slot on the flight test

31:41.443 --> 31:43.195
just waiting for me to waltz in.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.575
Okay, and if that's the case...

31:50.702 --> 31:53.580
you'll ask for carrier duty then, right?

31:53.664 --> 31:55.499
Commander of your own fighter squadron?

31:55.582 --> 31:58.293
Which means, based on your past,

31:58.377 --> 32:00.295
they will send you back to Seventh Fleet,

32:00.379 --> 32:02.005
which means we'll be based out of Pearl.

32:02.089 --> 32:04.132
I mean, housing isn't great,

32:04.216 --> 32:07.010
but it's Oahu,
so you can't complain, right?

32:07.094 --> 32:08.554
Not that you'll see much of Oahu,

32:08.637 --> 32:12.474
because you'll be commanding your squadron
on your carrier on Yankee Station,

32:12.558 --> 32:14.309
flying strike missions over Vietnam.

32:14.393 --> 32:15.644
It's what I do, Karen.

32:15.727 --> 32:17.980
That is a goddamn useless thing to say.

32:21.733 --> 32:22.734
[Ed sighs]

32:28.490 --> 32:30.868
I didn't know
it was gonna blow up like this.

32:31.952 --> 32:35.205
[stammers] Why? Because you were
just two guys in a bar

32:35.289 --> 32:36.999
talking and telling it like it is?

32:37.082 --> 32:38.834
-Something like that.
-To a reporter!

32:40.043 --> 32:43.297
I thought there was
supposed to be this code.

32:44.006 --> 32:47.843
The pilot's code that says you're not
supposed to talk about your feelings.

32:48.343 --> 32:51.597
Like, how you might feel
about not landing on the moon,

32:51.680 --> 32:55.309
or, I don't know, how you feel
about the whole damned space program.

32:56.059 --> 32:58.729
The code says you're not supposed
to talk about those things.

32:59.438 --> 33:01.106
That's what you said.
Not with your buddies,

33:01.190 --> 33:03.483
not with your family, not with your wife.

33:03.567 --> 33:05.444
-This has nothing to do--
-I mean, who knew?

33:06.653 --> 33:09.656
Who knew that all it took
was a couple of drinks in a dive bar

33:09.740 --> 33:11.200
for you to break that code?

33:12.034 --> 33:13.702
I'm gonna learn to drink with the guys.

33:13.785 --> 33:16.997
Yeah, 'cause then I can find out
how my husband really feels about his job.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.000
Or I'll just read about it
in the newspapers with everyone else!

33:20.959 --> 33:22.503
[door opens]

33:22.586 --> 33:23.587
Right?

33:24.129 --> 33:25.339
[door closes]

33:28.175 --> 33:30.093
[sighs, sniffs]

33:54.785 --> 33:56.078
[sighs]

34:17.056 --> 34:18.684
[Ed groans, sighs]

34:21.687 --> 34:22.688
Your neck?

34:22.771 --> 34:25.690
Yeah. Couch is too damn small.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.569
I like it that way.

34:30.779 --> 34:31.864
Why is that?

34:34.366 --> 34:35.868
So there's no other choice.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.804
[chattering]

35:03.562 --> 35:04.730
[door opens]

35:11.320 --> 35:13.030
[chattering stops]

35:20.204 --> 35:21.538
The hell y'all looking at?

35:23.916 --> 35:26.877
You never seen a lowly pudknocker
from Apollo Applications?

35:37.012 --> 35:38.180
[chuckles]

35:38.764 --> 35:39.890
Look, uh,

35:39.973 --> 35:45.604
I know there was some dumb son of a bitch

35:45.687 --> 35:50.275
that shot his mouth off in the press
and made the whole agency look bad.

35:52.528 --> 35:54.071
But I also know that

35:54.154 --> 35:57.824
the crew of Apollo 11 is gonna make
everyone forget about all that.

35:58.534 --> 36:01.662
Because Neil, Buzz, Mike,

36:01.745 --> 36:06.500
they're the kind of guys
who don't fold when things get tough.

36:09.628 --> 36:12.756
They're the kinda guys
that might get knocked down...

36:14.550 --> 36:19.513
but then they just pick themselves up
and get back to work.

36:22.224 --> 36:23.934
[sighs]

36:29.314 --> 36:33.402
So, I'm here to help you boys
get back to work.

36:33.485 --> 36:34.778
Any way I can.

36:34.862 --> 36:37.614
From Siberia...

36:39.741 --> 36:44.538
I bring you adjusted fuel
and payload calculations for the S-IVB.

36:58.051 --> 37:00.721
I think Siberia...

37:03.182 --> 37:04.558
sits over there.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.518
[laughter]

37:11.523 --> 37:14.359
[chattering resumes]

37:18.488 --> 37:19.740
[door opens]

37:27.539 --> 37:29.082
Two weeks to launch, gentlemen.

37:29.708 --> 37:32.127
This will be our last meeting
before 11 heads for the Cape,

37:32.211 --> 37:34.004
so I want final checklists on my desk.

37:42.513 --> 37:44.097
[Deke] So, will he make the call?

37:44.932 --> 37:45.933
[administrator] I don't know.

37:46.016 --> 37:48.602
Ziegler said the president wants to call
the astronauts on the moon,

37:48.685 --> 37:51.480
but I think they're
leaving themselves some wiggle room.

37:51.563 --> 37:55.025
But it's another chance to demonstrate
the superiority of our technology.

37:55.776 --> 37:57.319
The Russian audio was terrible.

37:57.819 --> 38:01.323
We will call a man on the moon
from a telephone. I mean, it's amazing.

38:01.406 --> 38:03.534
I told them. You know what Ziegler said?

38:04.409 --> 38:07.287
"The president doesn't usually call
the silver medalist."

38:07.371 --> 38:08.372
[engineer] Got it!

38:08.455 --> 38:10.958
[wind whooshing]

38:11.041 --> 38:13.001
It wasn't easy, but I got it.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.338
Just glad we remembered.

38:16.964 --> 38:20.092
Just as well. It was always extra weight.

38:20.175 --> 38:22.302
[jets approaching]

38:22.386 --> 38:24.304
[jets pass overhead]

38:26.974 --> 38:28.058
Pilots.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.644
We should have stuck with the monkeys.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.396
[administrator chuckles]

38:35.482 --> 38:37.025
[newscaster] Almost a month has passed

38:37.109 --> 38:40.654
since the historic landing
of a Soviet cosmonaut on the moon

38:40.737 --> 38:42.155
shocked the world.

38:42.239 --> 38:46.910
During that time, the crew of Apollo 11
has continued to train and prepare

38:46.994 --> 38:49.955
for their own historic landing
on the lunar surface.

38:51.081 --> 38:53.792
While the Nixon administration has made
no public commitment

38:53.876 --> 38:55.544
to any landing beyond this one,

38:55.627 --> 38:58.088
multiple anonymous sources
in the White House have said

38:58.172 --> 39:00.465
that if Apollo 11 were to end in failure,

39:00.549 --> 39:03.260
the entire program
would probably be canceled.

39:03.343 --> 39:05.179
["It's Your Thing" playing]

39:29.828 --> 39:32.247
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.

39:32.331 --> 39:34.917
The crew are aboard the spacecraft,
the hatch is closed,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.794
and everything seems
to be proceeding satisfactorily.

39:38.253 --> 39:41.256
In just a few moments, there will be
a scheduled hold in the count

39:41.340 --> 39:44.009
at exactly T-minus two hours.

39:44.092 --> 39:47.554
[flight director]
Built-in hold in five, four,

39:47.638 --> 39:51.183
three, two, one.

39:51.266 --> 39:52.267
Holding.

39:52.351 --> 39:55.229
The count has been held
at T-minus two hours.

39:55.312 --> 39:57.689
Flight Director Gene Kranz
is now giving last-minute...

39:57.773 --> 40:00.192
Jim, I want you to bring in the backups
and lock the doors.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.402
-Cut the video and the mics.
-You got it, Flight.

40:21.672 --> 40:24.633
Till a few weeks ago,
I thought I knew what today was all about.

40:26.593 --> 40:28.512
I thought it was about being first.

40:30.138 --> 40:32.349
Turns out
the stakes are much bigger than that.

40:33.934 --> 40:36.478
Today is about the future of our country.

40:37.229 --> 40:38.397
The future of the world.

40:39.690 --> 40:42.526
Because if we fail in our mission today,

40:42.609 --> 40:45.362
the United States will
turn away from space,

40:46.363 --> 40:47.823
turn away from the future.

40:48.699 --> 40:52.286
Bogged down by war, poverty, hatred.

40:54.705 --> 40:55.998
And the future?

40:57.332 --> 40:59.376
Well, the future will belong
to the Soviet Union.

41:00.043 --> 41:03.589
They will be the ones
reaching into space for all of mankind.

41:05.632 --> 41:08.093
Now, I want you all to think about that
for a moment.

41:10.679 --> 41:13.182
What that means for the future,

41:13.265 --> 41:16.351
to look like
the "Marxist-Leninist way of life."

41:20.564 --> 41:22.316
But if we succeed,

41:23.525 --> 41:26.904
if we succeed
in putting Apollo 11 on the moon,

41:27.905 --> 41:29.239
we're still in this thing.

41:29.323 --> 41:31.450
Still in the race.

41:31.533 --> 41:35.454
The future will be ours
to fight for and to win.

41:37.414 --> 41:39.208
We put a man on the moon today,

41:39.291 --> 41:41.835
I guarantee we are not stopping there.

41:42.961 --> 41:45.756
We'll go to Mars. Saturn.

41:46.173 --> 41:49.176
The asteroids, the stars, deep space.

41:49.968 --> 41:51.094
The galaxy.

41:52.638 --> 41:56.517
And then, then we're getting answers
to the big questions.

41:58.268 --> 42:01.438
Are we alone? Is there life out there?

42:04.566 --> 42:08.529
I am proud to be a member of this team,

42:09.947 --> 42:12.866
and I know that we will succeed today
in our mission...

42:13.951 --> 42:18.038
in putting two Americans on the moon.

42:18.830 --> 42:23.085
Because in this room, in this agency,

42:23.669 --> 42:25.254
in this country...

42:27.339 --> 42:29.132
failure is not an option.

42:43.146 --> 42:45.566
Kennedy Launch Control,
we are go for launch.

42:46.233 --> 42:49.111
Copy, Houston.
We are resuming the countdown.

42:49.194 --> 42:51.321
[chattering]

43:11.842 --> 43:14.094
[radio newscaster in Spanish]
Flying for almost four days,

43:14.178 --> 43:19.808
the American spacecraft known as the Eagle
is on course toward the lunar surface.

43:19.892 --> 43:25.189
The spacecraft carrying
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin

43:25.272 --> 43:27.399
is now now flying on its own power.

43:27.858 --> 43:32.404
It should start its descent
in approximately one hour.

43:39.036 --> 43:41.538
[newscaster on TV] Why don't you
give us an idea of the landing stage

43:41.622 --> 43:43.540
of the lunar module in the Eagle?

43:44.082 --> 43:47.878
After separation,
the LEM will perform a pitch-up maneuver,

43:47.961 --> 43:50.547
then the two spacecraft will
back away from one another...

43:50.631 --> 43:52.674
Don't get too rowdy with the boys, okay?

43:52.758 --> 43:54.384
Try to behave.

43:54.468 --> 43:56.970
Well, hey, Shane. Have a seat. Welcome.

43:57.846 --> 43:59.556
-Hey. Come on in.
-Thanks.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.517
-Can I take your purse?
-No. I'll set it down.

44:02.142 --> 44:06.313
...a short burn, which will send them
down towards the surface.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.358
...attempting this dangerous landing.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.161
Cheers.

44:21.912 --> 44:24.122
To Snoopy and what might have been.

44:29.962 --> 44:33.131
You ever think about
what you would have said if it'd been you?

44:35.133 --> 44:38.303
-What's that?
-If you were the first man on the moon.

44:39.304 --> 44:40.681
Probably something better than

44:40.764 --> 44:43.934
"I'm here for the Marxist-Leninist
way of fucking life," I'm sure.

44:46.478 --> 44:47.688
Never thought about it.

44:49.273 --> 44:50.566
Come on. Never?

44:51.859 --> 44:53.694
-Never once.
-Oh.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.114
I thought about it a lot.

44:57.823 --> 44:59.199
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm.

45:00.242 --> 45:01.785
So, what would you have said, Gordo?

45:02.286 --> 45:03.495
-Thanks, Pam.
-Anytime, Ed.

45:03.579 --> 45:06.915
Well, first I thought, you know,
maybe quote one of the classics.

45:06.999 --> 45:09.376
Aristotle, Plutarch, Voltaire.

45:09.459 --> 45:10.502
Dean Martin.

45:12.504 --> 45:16.216
But then I thought, no,
it should be about today. Now.

45:16.300 --> 45:20.345
You know, the whole world seems
like it's tearing itself apart.

45:20.429 --> 45:23.682
War, death, hate.

45:25.100 --> 45:26.768
Chicago, last year.

45:27.394 --> 45:29.479
Man, Chicago last year.

45:30.022 --> 45:32.191
I never seen anything like that before.

45:33.150 --> 45:36.820
I love that city. I went to school there.
I had a bunch of friends, you know?

45:36.904 --> 45:39.615
And to be back there on those streets
where I went to school

45:39.698 --> 45:41.325
and see it all go down like that?

45:41.408 --> 45:44.119
You know,
the cops just beating on those kids?

45:44.912 --> 45:47.122
You remember? You know?

45:47.789 --> 45:50.167
Just crushing their heads
with their batons

45:50.250 --> 45:52.127
and just blood everywhere and they--

45:52.211 --> 45:53.879
I just never seen that before.

45:56.131 --> 46:00.135
To see the hate in their eyes.

46:01.220 --> 46:04.806
You know, they wanted to kill those kids.
They wanted to crush them.

46:04.890 --> 46:07.434
Right? Like they were just bugs.

46:08.101 --> 46:10.395
And I thought to myself, "You know, maybe,

46:10.479 --> 46:13.398
maybe a man being up on the moon...

46:15.400 --> 46:19.947
might make people like that
just lift their eyes for a moment

46:20.030 --> 46:23.408
and look past that hate
and see something bigger.

46:25.285 --> 46:26.411
Bigger like...

46:28.580 --> 46:29.665
hope."

46:34.002 --> 46:35.546
So, what would you have said, Gordo?

46:36.922 --> 46:38.882
-Hmm?
-What would you have said?

46:39.633 --> 46:40.801
Um...

46:42.386 --> 46:43.387
Uh...

46:44.263 --> 46:45.472
I would've said...

46:46.765 --> 46:49.268
I'm Gordo Stevens and I come in peace.

46:54.690 --> 46:56.191
Three times a night.

46:56.692 --> 46:59.236

47:03.657 --> 47:05.534
-[Ed] You're a stupid idiot.
-[Pam laughs]

47:07.327 --> 47:10.247
You're a stupid, stupid man.

47:10.330 --> 47:11.498
You had me.

for going over the hill.

[man on PA] Loss of signal of Apollo 11.
Reacquisition in 48 minutes.

47:53.081 --> 47:54.583
Good time for a head call.

47:56.960 --> 47:57.961
[grunts]

47:59.713 --> 48:02.841
It's pretty disturbing,
but it was really good.

48:03.217 --> 48:04.968
-Mmm.
-You know, it sticks with you.

48:06.303 --> 48:07.471
Jon Voight is amazing.

48:08.680 --> 48:10.599
[sighs] What did Gordo think
of this movie?

48:10.682 --> 48:13.435
Oh, he was just upset
that it wasn't that kind of X-rated film.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.603
Of course he was.

48:14.686 --> 48:17.022
Marge. It's so good to see you.

48:17.481 --> 48:18.690
Well, well, well.

48:19.274 --> 48:20.984
The queen has arrived.

48:21.068 --> 48:23.820
-I thought you said she wasn't coming.
-I assumed she wasn't.

48:23.904 --> 48:25.781
If I had known
Deke's wife was gonna show up,

48:25.864 --> 48:27.866
I would've had the butler
bring out the good silver.

48:27.950 --> 48:30.410
-Hello, Karen.
-Hello.

48:30.494 --> 48:31.787
-Tracy.
-Marge.

48:32.287 --> 48:33.413
Are you busy right now?

48:34.331 --> 48:35.332
Not at all.

48:35.415 --> 48:36.917
Good. Excuse us.

48:38.919 --> 48:40.504
-Napkin.
-Thanks.

48:41.088 --> 48:44.132
[Fred on TV] It's a small spacecraft
for three grown men to live in full-time.

48:44.842 --> 48:46.468
-Should we sit down?
-[Karen] Sure.

48:47.302 --> 48:48.303
[door closes]

48:53.433 --> 48:54.434
[Marge sighs]

48:58.397 --> 49:02.234
Everyone believes it would be
in the best interests of the agency...

49:03.485 --> 49:05.153
and the country

49:05.237 --> 49:07.865
for Edward to make a public denial,

49:08.574 --> 49:13.954
stating emphatically that
he was grossly misquoted by that reporter

49:14.037 --> 49:17.916
and strongly disassociating himself
from those remarks.

49:23.505 --> 49:26.300
I also think, in that instance,

49:27.926 --> 49:31.805
Deke would be able to persuade
Dr. von Braun to reinstate him on 15.

49:35.559 --> 49:39.104
-[chuckles] It's not that simple, Marge.
-Mmm.

49:44.193 --> 49:45.944
Eddie would never get up and lie.

49:46.028 --> 49:48.113
He went to Annapolis. Right?

49:48.197 --> 49:51.241
Duty, honor, country.
Those things matter to him.

49:52.784 --> 49:55.704
You don't have to go to Annapolis
to have integrity, Karen.

49:55.787 --> 49:58.957
No, I don't mean to imply that,
but I know my husband--

49:59.041 --> 50:00.626
Duty, honor, country.

50:02.085 --> 50:03.420
I believe in those things.

50:05.005 --> 50:06.298
[extinguishes cigarette]

50:06.381 --> 50:07.424
Sometimes...

50:08.842 --> 50:10.427
you have to pick two.

50:19.102 --> 50:21.897
[radio newscaster in Spanish]
This is a very exciting time.

50:22.272 --> 50:25.567
Just one month ago,
Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov

50:25.651 --> 50:27.861
became the first man
to step foot on the moon.

50:28.779 --> 50:32.074
Now, American astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin

50:32.533 --> 50:34.117
hope to do the same.

50:34.493 --> 50:38.121
Much preparation has been made
for this moment.

50:38.580 --> 50:42.209
Millions of people around the world
await their landing.

50:43.293 --> 50:45.712
Once they are on the moon's surface...

50:49.925 --> 50:51.468
Your father says he misses you.

50:53.053 --> 50:56.390
-[Margo sighs]
-He says you don't call. You don't write.

50:57.850 --> 50:59.518
You should go home and see him.

50:59.601 --> 51:00.644
I'll call.

51:01.603 --> 51:03.230
Have you no wish to go home?

51:03.772 --> 51:06.733
No sentimental attachments to Huntsville?

51:08.235 --> 51:10.070
To paraphrase a great man,

51:11.071 --> 51:15.075
-"Alabama is not a place for feelings."
-[laughs]

51:15.993 --> 51:18.829
Your tongue will get you in trouble
one day, Margo.

51:19.454 --> 51:20.706
So I've heard.

51:24.126 --> 51:27.337
[man on PA] One minute
to reacquisition of signal from Apollo 11.

51:27.421 --> 51:28.922
One minute to reacquisition.

51:29.965 --> 51:33.010
All the work was for this moment.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.097
We are about to land a man on the moon.

51:42.477 --> 51:43.478
Come.

51:50.944 --> 51:52.279
Godspeed, Eagle.

51:54.364 --> 51:56.325
Eagle has begun its final descent...

51:56.408 --> 51:57.451
Final approach!

51:59.953 --> 52:00.996
Come on now, Neil.

52:01.079 --> 52:03.540
You got this, buddy! Right down the pipe!

52:04.249 --> 52:06.585
Okay. Gather round, gather round.
Come on, kids. Come on.

52:06.668 --> 52:08.962
-[Karen] Come on. Sit down, Shane.
-They're heading for the landing.

52:09.379 --> 52:10.589
Isn't this exciting?

52:10.672 --> 52:14.176
...two men to descend from orbit
to the moon's surface

52:14.259 --> 52:15.636
and then back up again.

52:15.719 --> 52:16.762
Cheers.

52:16.845 --> 52:18.514
It is a marvel of modern engineering.

52:18.597 --> 52:22.059
[radio newscaster speaking Spanish]

52:25.312 --> 52:26.480
[guide, in Spanish] There it is.

52:27.856 --> 52:29.900
There is a crossing
half a mile to the east.

52:36.031 --> 52:37.157
This way.

52:40.035 --> 52:41.703
-Turn that off!
-[radio switches off]

52:41.787 --> 52:43.288
Silence from now on!

52:51.129 --> 52:53.423
[astronaut 2 on radio]
Beta ARM. Altitudes are a little high.

52:57.928 --> 53:00.973
Houston, I'm getting a little fluctuation
in the AC voltage now.

53:02.933 --> 53:05.394
Roger. Looks good to us.
You're still looking good at three.

53:05.477 --> 53:06.603
Coming up three minutes.

53:08.981 --> 53:11.942
[Neil on radio] Our position checks
downrange show us to be a little long.

53:21.493 --> 53:24.288
AGS has gone about two feet per second
greater than it should be.

53:26.206 --> 53:29.835
Roger. That still looks good to us.
You are go. You are go for landing.

53:29.918 --> 53:32.379
Roger. Understood. Go for landing.

53:34.631 --> 53:35.924
Three thousand feet.

53:37.050 --> 53:38.635
Eight hundred feet.

53:38.719 --> 53:41.054
Eight hundred feet.
Into the AGS, 47 degrees.

53:41.972 --> 53:43.724
[CAPCOM]
Eagle, looking great. You're go.

53:45.058 --> 53:46.351
Thirty-five degrees.

53:47.728 --> 53:52.107
Thirty-five degrees.
750. Coming down to 23.

53:52.191 --> 53:53.400
Copy.

53:54.151 --> 53:56.612
Three hundred feet,
down three and a half, 47 forward.

53:58.238 --> 53:59.823
Altitude velocity light.

54:00.782 --> 54:01.992
Watch your shadow out there.

54:04.244 --> 54:05.579
I see the shadow.

54:06.455 --> 54:09.041
Wait. Got some boulders up ahead.

54:09.666 --> 54:10.667
Right in our path.

54:11.293 --> 54:13.879
I'm going long, looking for a better site.

54:14.379 --> 54:15.380
Thrusting forward.

54:16.632 --> 54:19.051
One hundred feet,
three and a half down, nine forward.

54:19.134 --> 54:20.302
Five percent.

54:20.761 --> 54:22.429
Control, how much fuel does he have left?

54:22.930 --> 54:24.014
Twenty seconds, Flight.

54:25.390 --> 54:26.433
Seventy-five feet.

54:27.100 --> 54:29.645
Rocks everywhere.
Still looking for a spot to set down.

54:30.312 --> 54:31.730
He's outside the safety margin.

54:33.565 --> 54:34.733
Should we abort?

54:37.069 --> 54:39.905
Neil knows the situation.
It's his spacecraft now.

54:42.407 --> 54:44.201
Lights on. Twenty feet.

54:45.244 --> 54:46.537
Kicking up some dust.

54:46.620 --> 54:48.455
-Lot of dust.
-Drifting right.

54:48.539 --> 54:49.540
Watch that one!

54:50.415 --> 54:51.458
Watch it!

54:52.167 --> 54:53.252
We've lost telemetry.

54:53.919 --> 54:54.920
No bioreadings!

54:55.796 --> 54:56.755
Lost contact.

54:56.839 --> 54:59.341
AGC is negative.
And no data from the onboard computer.

54:59.424 --> 55:00.801
Flight, I've got nothing here.

55:00.884 --> 55:02.427
-I've lost the whole board!
-No signal!

55:08.809 --> 55:10.894
Settle down, people. Settle!

55:12.980 --> 55:14.773
CAPCOM, see if you can raise the LEM.

55:15.858 --> 55:17.734
Eagle, Houston. Do you read?

55:20.028 --> 55:22.155
Eagle, this is Houston. Do you read?

55:27.828 --> 55:29.872
Eagle, this is Houston, do you copy?

55:31.456 --> 55:33.584
Eagle, Houston. Do you read?

55:33.667 --> 55:35.127
CAPCOM, see if Columbia can reach them.

55:35.878 --> 55:39.173
Columbia, Houston. We've lost contact
with the Eagle. See if you can raise them.

55:39.715 --> 55:41.175
Roger that, Houston.

55:41.258 --> 55:43.552
Eagle, Columbia. Do you read? Over.

55:45.804 --> 55:49.266
Eagle, this is Columbia.
Can you copy my transmission? Come back.

55:53.145 --> 55:54.396
Eagle, this is Columbia.

55:54.855 --> 55:56.064
How do you read?

56:02.696 --> 56:05.324
Eagle, this is Houston. Do you copy?

56:05.908 --> 56:06.909
Over.

56:12.998 --> 56:15.167
Is it possible the spacecraft exploded?

56:16.126 --> 56:17.878
Unlikely.

56:17.961 --> 56:19.379
If the LEM had exploded,

56:19.463 --> 56:21.340
we would have seen some precursor events

56:21.423 --> 56:23.342
in the telemetry stream
before we lost signal.

56:23.425 --> 56:26.386
They're outta fuel,
so they're definitely down.

56:26.470 --> 56:28.055
Maybe it was just communications.

56:28.138 --> 56:29.640
And all telemetry? No.

56:30.682 --> 56:32.434
These are independent systems.

56:32.518 --> 56:37.648
They could not fail simultaneously
unless there was a catastrophic event.

56:39.733 --> 56:40.859
So they crashed?

56:41.860 --> 56:43.153
Most likely.

56:44.947 --> 56:46.532
[Kranz] The skin on the Eagle is so thin,

56:46.615 --> 56:49.034
you could punch a hole in it
with a screwdriver.

56:52.579 --> 56:54.998
At least they were in their suits.

56:55.082 --> 56:57.876
So, they could've survived
a breach of the LEM's hull.

57:02.798 --> 57:05.676
If they are alive,
what's our contingency plan?

57:06.009 --> 57:07.845
There is no contingency plan.

57:07.928 --> 57:11.056
There is no way to effect a rescue
from the lunar surface.

57:11.974 --> 57:15.769
Columbia will pass over Tranquility
in 54 minutes.

57:16.562 --> 57:18.146
There's a telescope on board.

57:18.647 --> 57:20.357
Maybe Mike can see something from orbit.

57:21.441 --> 57:24.319
Eagle, this is Houston. Do you copy? Over.

57:33.412 --> 57:36.498
[Mike on radio] I'm coming up
on the Sea of Tranquility now.

57:36.582 --> 57:38.792
I'm following the surface terrain.

57:39.751 --> 57:42.337
I think the landing site
should be coming up soon.

57:43.046 --> 57:45.966
Can't see anything yet. Nothing.

57:47.217 --> 57:50.345
Can't see-- Wait. There.

57:50.429 --> 57:52.097
Don't know if you can see this.

57:52.181 --> 57:53.473
I don't see anything.

57:53.557 --> 57:55.142
Mike's got a better view
through the scope.

57:55.225 --> 57:57.144
We're just looking at a shitty TV screen.

57:57.519 --> 57:59.605
[gasps] I see Eagle.

58:00.022 --> 58:05.068
I'd say she's about six to eight miles
southwest to the targeted landing site.

58:05.152 --> 58:08.280
Seems to be in a pretty rocky area.

58:08.363 --> 58:10.324
Can't see any movement or activity.

58:10.407 --> 58:12.075
He wouldn't be able to from that altitude.

58:12.743 --> 58:14.411
At least we know where they are.

58:15.287 --> 58:17.956
Eagle, this is Houston. Do you copy? Over.

58:18.665 --> 58:21.543
[newscaster] Thousands have gathered
in cities across the world,

58:21.627 --> 58:26.048
waiting with bated breath for any word
on the fate of Apollo 11 and its crew.

58:26.131 --> 58:29.968
But as more time passes,
hope is beginning to fade.

58:30.052 --> 58:34.598
In Rome, Pope Paul led the faithful
in prayers for the return of the men,

58:34.681 --> 58:36.099
quoting the Ninth Psalm,

58:36.183 --> 58:39.728
"The Lord is a stronghold
in times of trouble."

58:42.231 --> 58:48.195
To recap: It's been over four hours since
radio contact with the Eagle was lost...

58:48.737 --> 58:51.490
Karen, you and Louanne
head over to the Aldrin house.

58:51.573 --> 58:53.617
Betty and Jackie, to the Collins.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.994
Linda, you come with me
over to the Armstrongs.

58:56.078 --> 58:57.746
There's gonna be a lot of press out there,

58:57.829 --> 58:59.790
but you just push past them
and say "No comment."

58:59.873 --> 59:01.625
Everyone else,
stay here with Tracy and the kids

59:01.708 --> 59:03.335
and hold down the fort, please.

59:03.836 --> 59:05.295
Stay by your phones.

59:06.129 --> 59:07.631
I think it's gonna be a long night.

59:09.716 --> 59:10.717
Let's go.

59:17.599 --> 59:18.433
Mr. President,

59:18.517 --> 59:20.978
after running various simulations

59:21.061 --> 59:22.104
it is our judgment

59:22.187 --> 59:24.231
that the likelihood of the astronauts

59:24.314 --> 59:26.859
having survived a crash of this nature

59:27.359 --> 59:28.986
...is very low.

59:29.069 --> 59:30.988
[Nixon sighs] It's...

59:31.405 --> 59:32.656
such a tragedy.

59:32.739 --> 59:36.952
[Paine] There is a statement that was
prepared for you in just this eventuality.

59:37.035 --> 59:38.078
[Nixon] Yeah, I've read it.

59:38.620 --> 59:39.454
I'll...

59:40.455 --> 59:43.417
alert the networks that I want
airtime to address the nation.

59:47.254 --> 59:48.839
"In ancient days..."

59:50.132 --> 59:51.592
--better ancient times, I think.

59:52.092 --> 59:53.844
"In ancient times..."

59:54.178 --> 59:58.599
"men looked at stars and saw their
heroes in the constellations."

59:59.558 --> 1:00:01.977
"In modern times we do much the same..."

1:00:02.728 --> 1:00:05.772
"but our heroes are epic men
of flesh and blood..."

1:00:07.024 --> 1:00:10.027
"and these men will remain
the foremost in our hearts."

1:00:10.777 --> 1:00:15.199
"For every human being who looks up
at the moon in the nights to come..."

1:00:16.116 --> 1:00:18.869
"will know that there is some corner
of another world..."

1:00:19.536 --> 1:00:21.413
"that is forever mankind."

1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:26.001
Okay, that's great.
We'll do it just like that.

1:00:26.084 --> 1:00:28.003
[both speaking Spanish]

1:00:59.159 --> 1:01:02.162
There's nothing left
for us to do in the back,

1:01:03.163 --> 1:01:04.540
so they let us go.

1:01:06.416 --> 1:01:08.126
There is an old superstition.

1:01:09.461 --> 1:01:12.256
Never drink to a success
before it happens.

1:01:12.881 --> 1:01:16.009
Not very scientific, but good advice.

1:01:16.093 --> 1:01:18.470
Doctor, we have a problem.

1:01:22.266 --> 1:01:24.893
Mike, I think we all understand
how you feel, but...

1:01:24.977 --> 1:01:28.355
All due respect, Houston,
I don't think you do understand.

1:01:28.438 --> 1:01:31.233
I decided a long time ago that
if something like this were to happen,

1:01:31.316 --> 1:01:33.026
that I wasn't coming home alone.

1:01:33.443 --> 1:01:35.070
I'm staying right where I am.

1:01:35.153 --> 1:01:36.572
Columbia, out.

1:01:37.155 --> 1:01:39.408
[stammers]
He doesn't get to make that decision.

1:01:39.491 --> 1:01:40.951
Give him a direct command. An order.

1:01:41.034 --> 1:01:43.996
The man's 200,000 miles away.
How you gonna enforce it?

1:01:44.079 --> 1:01:46.498
I am not calling the president
and telling him

1:01:46.582 --> 1:01:49.877
that Michael Collins refuses
to come home alone.

1:01:50.377 --> 1:01:52.004
Find his wife. Get her to talk to him.

1:01:52.087 --> 1:01:55.924
Oh, Jesus Christ. Please tell me
we are not gonna bring this man's wife in.

1:01:56.008 --> 1:01:58.468

[astronaut on radio, indistinct]

1:02:05.726 --> 1:02:08.729
Houston. Tranquility Base here.
Do you read? Over.

1:02:08.812 --> 1:02:10.772
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Neil, is that you?

1:02:11.190 --> 1:02:12.816
That's affirmative, Houston.

1:02:13.233 --> 1:02:16.236
Just wanted to let you know
that the Eagle has landed.

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:18.447
She might have clipped a feather or two
on the way down,

1:02:18.530 --> 1:02:21.533
but she's still here, and so are we.

1:02:21.617 --> 1:02:23.535
[cheers, shouting]

1:02:24.661 --> 1:02:26.455
[all cheering]

1:02:26.538 --> 1:02:28.040
[screams, cheers]

1:02:28.123 --> 1:02:29.750
[laughing]

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:32.252
[cheering continues]

1:02:34.213 --> 1:02:35.589
[CAPCOM] Copy that, Tranquility.

1:02:35.672 --> 1:02:38.300
You just made a whole lot of people
very happy down here.

1:02:39.051 --> 1:02:40.636
[Neil] Glad to hear it, Houston.

1:02:40.719 --> 1:02:43.472
We're pretty happy up here too,
to tell you the truth.

1:02:44.681 --> 1:02:46.683
[Buzz]
I think I got this camera working, Neil.

1:02:49.603 --> 1:02:51.188
[CAPCOM]
We have a picture, Eagle.

1:02:54.316 --> 1:02:55.651
[Neil] Not one of my better landings.

1:02:56.568 --> 1:02:58.946
But like we used to say in the navy,

1:02:59.029 --> 1:03:01.532
any landing that you can walk away from
is a good one.

1:03:03.075 --> 1:03:04.243
We had a rough start,

1:03:04.326 --> 1:03:07.663
but we've decided to pick ourselves up
and get back to work.

1:03:13.043 --> 1:03:14.878
Well, we did it.

1:03:15.504 --> 1:03:16.922
We're on the moon.

1:03:18.090 --> 1:03:19.675
Now we gotta get 'em home.

1:03:25.430 --> 1:03:29.810
