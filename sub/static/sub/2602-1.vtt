08:39.543 --> 08:40.842
Bang, bang.

08:40.876 --> 08:42.712
Great work, Detective.

08:42.712 --> 08:44.313
You get a tie.

08:44.314 --> 08:45.715
Hey, that's mine.
You took it from my desk.

08:45.716 --> 08:46.818
That's right, Charles.
Good solve.

08:46.850 --> 08:48.150
- Tie for you.
- Thanks!

08:48.151 --> 08:49.652
Now everyone be sure
to put those on

08:49.653 --> 08:51.053
because it's impossible
to solve crimes

08:51.054 --> 08:53.823
- unless you're wearing a tie.
- Lay off the Captain.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.524
That man is gonna be
my rabbi.

08:55.559 --> 08:57.226
Okay, first of all,
when you use the word "rabbi,"

08:57.227 --> 08:58.728
you know that turns me on

08:58.729 --> 09:00.062
and that's unfair
in the work environment.

09:00.063 --> 09:02.665
Secondly, your rabbi
is a pain in my ass.

09:02.699 --> 09:04.400
Yeah, he's a little
too serious.

09:04.401 --> 09:05.901
- What do you think, Rosa?
- He seems cool.

09:05.902 --> 09:07.536
Yeah, he seems cool.
I agree.

09:07.571 --> 09:10.372
Looks like the perp stole
a computer, a watch,

09:10.407 --> 09:14.043
and a Jamon Iberico ham,
valued at... what!

09:14.044 --> 09:15.611
$6,000.

09:15.612 --> 09:17.613
$6,000 for a ham?

09:17.614 --> 09:21.117
Jamon Iberico is an amazing
cured ham from Spain.

09:21.118 --> 09:22.718
They had it
at my uncle's funeral.

09:22.719 --> 09:25.054
I gorged myself
at that funeral.

09:25.055 --> 09:26.722
I mean, I was constipated
for three days.

09:26.757 --> 09:29.091
Wow, that's a great story,
Charles, thank you.

09:29.126 --> 09:30.926
[Laughing] <i>All right,
listen up, everybody.</i>

09:30.961 --> 09:32.328
Better contact Captain Holt,

09:32.329 --> 09:33.629
let him know
we got a ten-tie situation.

09:33.630 --> 09:36.565
Speaking of ties,
where's yours, meep morp?

09:36.566 --> 09:37.800
This is fantastic.

09:37.801 --> 09:39.468
Captain!
Hey!

09:39.469 --> 09:41.837
Welcome to the murder.
What are you doing here?

09:41.872 --> 09:43.239
I like to know
what my detectives are up to.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.074
- That okay by you?
- Yep.

09:45.075 --> 09:46.542
Take Santiago
and knock on doors.

09:46.543 --> 09:47.943
See if the neighbors
heard anything.

09:47.944 --> 09:49.378
Door duty?
It's a waste of time.

09:49.379 --> 09:51.213
Diaz and Boyle.
Check in the coroner.

09:51.214 --> 09:54.049
<i>Report back to me
in an hour.</i>

09:54.050 --> 09:56.919
- [Sighs] That went well.
- <i>No, it didn't.</i>

09:56.920 --> 09:59.588
He's got like super hearing.

09:59.623 --> 10:01.490
Hey, Rosa!
Rosa. Rosa!

10:01.491 --> 10:05.227
Um, I just happened
to notice

10:05.228 --> 10:06.896
that there's
an old movie festival

10:06.897 --> 10:09.832
playing at the film forum
this week.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.400
Wanna go?

10:11.434 --> 10:12.635
Sure.

10:12.669 --> 10:14.470
Cool! Awesome.

10:14.504 --> 10:16.272
<i>There's a bunch
of movie options.</i>

10:16.273 --> 10:19.475
<i>I'll probably just go
with something classic</i>

10:19.509 --> 10:21.143
like <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

10:21.144 --> 10:23.078
<i>Citizen Kane</i> is terrible.
Pick a good movie.

10:23.079 --> 10:25.614
<i>Good call. Smart.</i>

10:25.615 --> 10:27.116
<i>I'll do it.</i>

10:27.150 --> 10:30.753
I'll pick a better movie
than <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

10:30.754 --> 10:32.454
<i>(Holt)
So Gina...</i>

10:32.489 --> 10:34.490
Civilian administrators
like yourself

10:34.491 --> 10:36.292
often have their ear
to the ground.

10:36.326 --> 10:37.827
What do Santiago and Peralta

10:37.828 --> 10:39.228
have riding
on this bet of theirs?

10:39.262 --> 10:41.831
I will tell you
on six conditions.

10:41.865 --> 10:43.866
<i>Number one, you let me
use your office</i>

10:43.867 --> 10:45.367
to practice my dance moves.

10:45.368 --> 10:46.502
Second...
How about this?

10:46.536 --> 10:48.337
- If you tell me...
- Mm-hmm.

10:48.338 --> 10:50.105
I won't
have you suspended...

10:50.106 --> 10:51.240
Without pay.

10:51.274 --> 10:52.675
Oh, that sounds great.

10:52.676 --> 10:55.644
Okay, the deal is
if Amy gets more arrests,

10:55.645 --> 10:57.613
Jake has to give her
his car.

10:57.614 --> 10:59.882
It's an old Mustang,
and it's pretty sweet.

10:59.883 --> 11:01.550
If he gets more arrests,

11:01.551 --> 11:04.286
she has to go
on a date with him.

11:04.287 --> 11:07.790
He guarantees
it will end in sex.

11:07.824 --> 11:10.826
I bet on at least
some over-the-clothes action.

11:10.827 --> 11:12.494
At the very least,
some touching...

11:12.529 --> 11:13.863
- No, that's enough, Gina.
- Caresses.

11:13.897 --> 11:16.131
I could see him showing up
in a silk robe.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.233
- That's enough, Gina.
- All right.

11:17.234 --> 11:18.701
Thank you.

11:18.735 --> 11:21.136
<i>(Jake)
Let the wasting of time begin.</i>

11:21.137 --> 11:23.305
[Knock on door]

11:23.306 --> 11:24.807
Hello, sir.

11:24.808 --> 11:26.175
Can we ask you
a few questions?

11:26.176 --> 11:27.910
Definitely.
Yeah.

11:27.911 --> 11:29.845
I'm actually... I'm super glad
you guys are here right now.

11:29.846 --> 11:31.547
Are you smelling
that weed smell?

11:31.581 --> 11:32.681
(Both)
Yeah.

11:32.682 --> 11:33.682
'Cause a dude broke in,

11:33.717 --> 11:35.651
smoked weed,
and bolted.

11:35.652 --> 11:37.019
[Laughing]
It's...

11:37.053 --> 11:38.520
Do you think
it's the same dude

11:38.521 --> 11:40.256
that left that bong there
on the floor?

11:41.391 --> 11:42.825
Yes.

11:42.859 --> 11:46.028
Police!

11:46.029 --> 11:48.197
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:48.231 --> 11:49.331
What's your name?

11:49.332 --> 11:50.599
- My name?
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.401
- Mlepnos.
- Can you spell that, please?

11:52.402 --> 11:57.239
M-l-e-p...

11:57.240 --> 11:58.507
Clay.

11:58.508 --> 11:59.675
Did you say "Clay"?

11:59.676 --> 12:01.043
Yes, the "Clay" is silent.

12:01.077 --> 12:02.778
All right, got it.

12:02.779 --> 12:06.215
Have you seen this man before?
He was shot last night.

12:06.216 --> 12:08.951
Oh. Thank you.

12:08.952 --> 12:10.686
No, sir, that's ours.
We need that.

12:10.687 --> 12:12.688
- We...
- And he kept it.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.390
Wall Street journal
<i>on the doormat...</i>

12:14.424 --> 12:15.891
Top floor apartment.

12:15.892 --> 12:18.427
20 bucks says this guy's
like a hot, eligible bachelor.

12:18.428 --> 12:19.695
I'll take that action.

12:19.696 --> 12:22.631
Police! Open up!

12:22.632 --> 12:24.600
Hello.

12:24.634 --> 12:26.201
[Laughing]
Oh! Hello, sir!

12:26.202 --> 12:27.603
How are you today?

12:27.604 --> 12:29.238
I am Detective
Right-All-The-Time,

12:29.239 --> 12:32.541
and this is my partner
Detective Terrible Detective.

12:34.477 --> 12:35.945
No surprises from the coroner.

12:35.946 --> 12:37.646
A few gunshots,
shoulder and chest.

12:37.647 --> 12:39.815
None of the neighbors heard
or saw anything.

12:39.816 --> 12:43.052
And what's worse, Santiago
struck out with a 92-year-old.

12:43.086 --> 12:44.386
That is not accurate, sir.

12:44.421 --> 12:46.255
Wait, you hooked up
with him? Ugh!

12:46.256 --> 12:48.057
All right, hit the pawn shops
and canvass the neighborhood.

12:48.091 --> 12:49.491
And while you're out,
you can buy yourself a tie.

12:49.492 --> 12:50.960
<i>(Jake)
Oh, actually, sir...</i>

12:50.994 --> 12:52.928
I'm wearing a tie right now.

12:52.929 --> 12:54.496
Check it out.

12:54.497 --> 12:56.899
Secret tie.

12:56.933 --> 12:58.267
First of all, I think
you're kind of overdoing it

12:58.268 --> 12:59.668
with the manscaping.

12:59.669 --> 13:01.136
<i>But more importantly,
Detective,</i>

13:01.137 --> 13:03.305
why do you refuse to
take my orders seriously?

13:03.340 --> 13:05.107
Does anyone here know why
it's so important to me

13:05.141 --> 13:07.743
that you all dress
appropriately?

13:07.744 --> 13:09.997
<i>Hmm. Four highly trained
detectives</i>

13:10.013 --> 13:12.348
<i>and not one of you
can solve this simple mystery.</i>

13:12.349 --> 13:14.850
I wanna be briefed
on any new developments.

13:14.851 --> 13:16.285
Any questions?

13:16.286 --> 13:17.619
I was gonna ask you
if you thought I was doing

13:17.620 --> 13:19.121
too much manscaping,
but we solved that one.

13:19.122 --> 13:20.656
So I'm good.

13:20.657 --> 13:21.991
<i>Hey, Boyle.</i>

13:22.025 --> 13:23.759
- Yep.
- What about this fancy ham stuff?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.327
- Jamon Iberico.
- Yes.

13:25.362 --> 13:26.762
The perp left
a really expensive TV

13:26.763 --> 13:29.164
but then stole ham?
It doesn't make sense.

13:29.165 --> 13:31.667
Is there a place nearby
the crime scene that sells it?

13:31.668 --> 13:33.635
- Beneficio's might.
- Let's go.

13:33.636 --> 13:35.137
You gotta brief
the C.O. first.

13:35.138 --> 13:38.040
We'll brief him
after we catch the guy.

13:40.176 --> 13:42.177
My name is Ratko.
I don't know anything.

13:42.178 --> 13:43.679
Oh, okay.

13:43.713 --> 13:45.047
You recognize this guy?

13:45.048 --> 13:48.450
- Henry Morgenthau?
- No.

13:48.451 --> 13:51.020
Maybe actually look
at the picture.

13:51.054 --> 13:53.055
I don't know him.
I don't know what happened.

13:53.056 --> 13:54.656
No more questions.

13:54.657 --> 13:56.458
Well, why don't I run
a scenario past you, Ratko,

13:56.459 --> 13:57.793
and you tell me
what you think?

13:57.827 --> 13:59.194
You do know Morgenthau.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.462
He came in here and tried
to sell you some hams.

14:00.463 --> 14:01.663
You knew they were worth
a lotta money,

14:01.664 --> 14:02.798
so you tried to steal them
from him

14:02.799 --> 14:03.966
when he wasn't home.

14:03.967 --> 14:05.167
Only he was home,
so you shot him.

14:05.201 --> 14:07.236
Does that sound familiar?

14:07.237 --> 14:08.837
Uh, maybe some role play
will jog your memory?

14:08.838 --> 14:10.005
- Great idea.
- Okay, yeah.

14:10.006 --> 14:11.040
Okay.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.509
- So I'm... I'm Ratko.
- No, no, I'm Ratko.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.077
Come on.
I'm always the victim.

14:15.078 --> 14:16.712
Look, I'm doing this
with you right here.

14:16.746 --> 14:17.880
Fine, fine.

14:17.914 --> 14:19.715
Oh! I'm Henry Morgenthau,

and expensive hams.

14:22.352 --> 14:23.852
Don't I know you
from the grocery store?

14:23.853 --> 14:26.088

And scene.

14:27.891 --> 14:30.392
<i>(Jake)

14:30.427 --> 14:31.860
Ma'am, if you could
just get down,

14:31.861 --> 14:33.662
or... ignore me
and continue shopping.

14:33.663 --> 14:36.198

14:56.219 --> 14:57.286
I'm getting mad!

14:57.287 --> 14:58.821
That's a waste of manchego!

How are you still here?

anywhere, Jake!

15:10.533 --> 15:12.034

15:12.035 --> 15:15.304
Don't worry!

15:15.305 --> 15:18.207
(Jake)
So no, I did not brief you.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.975
<i>And yes, he did get away.</i>

15:19.976 --> 15:22.945
But some bonus good news...

15:22.946 --> 15:25.214
I got you hazelnut.

15:25.248 --> 15:27.549
[Whispering] And...

15:27.550 --> 15:30.552
A little spoon
there for you.

15:32.763 --> 15:34.167
[Scoffs] Is he seriously
assigning me

15:34.168 --> 15:35.669
to the records room?

15:35.670 --> 15:37.504
I mean, why do we even have
a records room?

15:37.505 --> 15:39.005
Computer's been invented, right?
I didn't dream it?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.440
You're lucky, man.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.943
I wish I could get
assigned here full-time.

15:42.944 --> 15:46.646
You could not be farther
from the action.

15:46.681 --> 15:48.848
Sergeant, you know me.
I have more arrests than anyone.

15:48.849 --> 15:50.417
Will you please tell the Captain
how dumb it is

15:50.418 --> 15:52.493
to lock his best Detective
in a file cabinet?

15:52.520 --> 15:54.587
Second best.
You're wrong about Holt.

15:54.622 --> 15:55.989
That man has forgotten more
about being a cop

15:56.023 --> 15:58.158
than you will ever know.

15:58.159 --> 16:01.494
In 1981, he caught
the disco strangler.

16:01.529 --> 16:03.530
[Light disco music]

16:03.531 --> 16:05.098
It's over, disco man!

16:05.099 --> 16:08.001

and back away from the girl.

16:10.204 --> 16:11.604
Wow.

16:11.605 --> 16:14.941
The man is the real deal.
You need to listen to him.

16:14.976 --> 16:16.609
Gonna be hard to win our bet

16:16.644 --> 16:18.378
when you're
on the bench, Peralta.

16:18.379 --> 16:21.781
Although I did start
a new category.

16:21.782 --> 16:23.416
"Murderers we let go."

16:23.451 --> 16:24.851
And look at that.

16:24.885 --> 16:27.587
You're winning.

16:27.621 --> 16:29.155
Have fun with your files.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.623
Yeah, you know what,
