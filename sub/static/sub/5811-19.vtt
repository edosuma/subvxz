00:02.200 --> 00:03.122
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.280 --> 00:05.487
- These people. They're volunteers?
- True believers.

00:05.640 --> 00:09.884
Thank you for your service,
your mind and your belief in me.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.288
- What happened?
- Prisoners were out of their cells.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.327
<i>"DARHK". Ms. Lance.</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:21.329
I want you to give your father a message.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.407
Help! Help in here, please!

00:26.600 --> 00:29.365
Ollie, I know
that I am not the love of your life,

00:30.240 --> 00:32.083
but you will always be the love of mine.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.611
Out of the Way!

00:35.000 --> 00:36.161
- What happened?
- I don't know. She was fine.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.883
<i>Time Of death, 11:59.</i>

00:58.560 --> 01:01.484
A life that hasn't had a chance
to fully grow

01:02.800 --> 01:04.404
and live out its purpose in this world

01:04.599 --> 01:08.241
is a life that has been
taken from this earth too soon.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.688
Oliver Queen,

01:10.920 --> 01:14.561
whom I'm told is practically family,
will be delivering the eulogy.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.847
Mr. Queen?

01:17.440 --> 01:19.044
Mr. Queen, are you ready?

01:22.640 --> 01:24.688
I could probably say a few words.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.687
Tommy Merlyn was one of the
greatest people that I've ever known.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.803
He was... He was so much more than just

01:48.840 --> 01:50.524
a billionaire playboy.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.085
I loved him.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.284
I loved him in every way
you could possibly love someone.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.041
So did Oliver.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.569
And I'm sure if Oliver could be here today
he would say so.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.404
But clearly it's too painful.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.004
I don't understand.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.931
I'm sorry. I...

02:51.520 --> 02:53.648
Where is she?

03:02.080 --> 03:04.048
- Excuse me, are you a relative...
- Doctor.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.001
It's her father.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.331
<i>I'm, um, terribly sorry
for your loss.</i>

03:12.800 --> 03:14.768
Uh, these are her belongings.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.126
I can take care of those.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.127
Laurel.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.441
Baby-

03:32.120 --> 03:33.963
We should get you out of here.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.085
I love you, too.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.766
Give that baby girl a kiss for me.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.164
Didn't expect to see you standing there.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.966
Where else would I go?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.206
How's Lyla?

04:00.320 --> 04:03.847
She and baby Sara
are at a A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.451
I have an army buddy
looking after Carly and Andy Jr.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.006
You worried about your brother?

04:09.280 --> 04:11.681
I don't think he would do anything
that hurt my family,

04:13.120 --> 04:14.326
but I don't know.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.084
Clearly I never knew him.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.247
All right, John.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.724
As the world's leading expert
in blaming yourself,

04:24.080 --> 04:25.081
please don't do it.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.810
You warned me, Oliver.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.486
Straight up. You warned me.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.722
If I had listened to you
instead of trusting my brother,

04:33.960 --> 04:35.450
Laurel would be alive right now.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.724
You can't know that.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.209
<i>On behalf of Mayor Adams
and everyone in City Hall,</i>

04:41.400 --> 04:46.281
<i>I am very sorry to announce the death of
Assistant District Attorney Laurel Lance.</i>

04:46.480 --> 04:49.962
<i>Ms. Lance was conducting
a deposition of Damien Darhk</i>

04:50.160 --> 04:52.811
<i>prior to tonight's incident
at Iron Heights Correctional Facility.</i>

04:53.000 --> 04:57.005
<i>I'm informed by the Department of
Corrections Mr. Darhk remains at large</i>

04:57.200 --> 05:00.090
<i>and is the leading suspect
in Ms. Lance's death.</i>

05:00.320 --> 05:02.049
I'm gonna get some air.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.010
John.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.683
Smith & Wesson 460XVR revolvers,

05:13.880 --> 05:18.249
Fifty-cal Desert Eagles,
Boberg 9-mil semi-autos.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.683
Fifteen large and they're all yours.
How about it?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.206
(%SCREECHES)

05:42.600 --> 05:44.523
Hey, I didn't know that...

05:44.720 --> 05:46.324
You called for the team.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.841
What's going on, Oliver?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.488
Well, Darhk is out there
and he has his magic back.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.890
As much as I'm sure all of us want to
climb up inside of our own grief...

05:58.120 --> 05:59.246
We have to get that son of a bitch.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.646
<i>"THEA". Definitely. But...</i>

06:01.840 --> 06:04.047
We haven't even put her in the ground yet.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.885
- Uh, Captain?
- Page three.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.208
This was last night, after Iron Heights.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.844
This article says that she used her
sonic weapon against a dealer and a buyer.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.246
Guys,
CCTV footage from last night's attack.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.362
So Sara came back...
All the crazy things that we've seen,

06:25.560 --> 06:27.562
maybe my baby, my baby girl,
maybe she's not gone.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.729
I mean, we... We saw her.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.165
Yeah, but you know, I mean.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.442
Everyone thought Oliver
was dead when the Gambit went down.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.166
Everybody thought Ray Palmer was dead.
Your brother?

06:40.360 --> 06:43.409
Captain, I know, I know,
but this is different.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.524
John's right. This bag from the hospital

06:46.760 --> 06:48.649
was supposed to contain
all of Laurel's belongings.

06:48.880 --> 06:49.881
<i>Supposed to.</i>

06:50.080 --> 06:51.366
Her sonic device is missing.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.766
You know, that explains it.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.008
There were people
in and out of Laurel's room.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.929
Doctors, nurses, orderlies...

06:57.160 --> 06:59.527
You think someone took it?

06:59.720 --> 07:00.881
Yeah.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.201
Laurel.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.485
Captain, let's not go there just yet.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.444
Now, you don't think that
with everything that we have seen,

07:07.640 --> 07:10.928
that we have all seen, that there is
a chance that Laurel is back?

07:11.120 --> 07:14.169
<i>Cisco keyed the sonic device
to Laurel's vocal chords.</i>

07:14.360 --> 07:15.930
No one else
is supposed to be able to use that.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.889
Right, right.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.009
What are you thinking?

07:44.240 --> 07:45.969
Quentin?

07:50.440 --> 07:51.680
Yeah.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.007
Dr. Schwartz...

08:04.160 --> 08:09.644
I'd like to thank you for your discretion
throughout all of this.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.930
Doctor/patient privilege.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.329
And in any case,
she, um, helped this city.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.243
The least I can do is help her and you.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.209
At least 12 staffers saw me
bring her into the hospital last night.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.731
And they saw the Black Canary.

08:33.919 --> 08:37.129
But we operated on Laurel Lance,

08:37.320 --> 08:41.450
who, I believe, was injured
during an Iron Heights prison riot.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.171
There was a Black Canary sighting
last night.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.686
This person was wearing a sonic device.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.289
The same sonic device that was taken
from Laurel's belongings in her room.

08:53.640 --> 08:54.607
Are you saying..-

08:54.840 --> 08:59.129
I have reason to believe that someone
walked into her room and took it.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.524
Now can you put me on a path?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.200
There's a frequent flyer...

09:09.520 --> 09:10.806
Frequent flyer? What does that mean?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.482
A patient who pays repeated visits
to the ER.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.685
Now I've treated her a few times
and there's something...

09:18.960 --> 09:20.803
- There's something off about her?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.563
Would you give me her name?

09:25.200 --> 09:29.091
Doctor/patient privilege
applies to all my patients, Mr. Queen.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.005
Yeah.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.329
Oliver.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.605
I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.365
Do you want to come inside?

09:52.160 --> 09:55.004
I don't think that it's the best idea.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.842
I'm sorry they didn't let your mom
attend the funeral.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.364
It was a nice service.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.364
Tommy would've liked it.

10:10.640 --> 10:13.166
He would've liked it more
if you would have said a few words.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.809
Stayed up all night.
I was working on the eulogy.

10:22.040 --> 10:27.729
I just filled page after page
with stories of us.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.522
But then I realized that I just didn't
have the right to say any of those things.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.681
What are you talking about?

10:38.880 --> 10:41.690
Oliver, Tommy loved you.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.489
Laurel, I failed him.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.688
I came back from that island
with another chance.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.848
It was a chance to help people.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.051
It was a chance to make this city better

11:05.360 --> 11:06.930
and I couldn't.

11:08.240 --> 11:11.005
And now Tommy's dead.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.605
Oliver,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.684
you can't blame yourself.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.206
You'd blame me, too,
if you knew the truth.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.284
What truth?

11:28.520 --> 11:32.684
That was Oliver.
Laurel's still, you know, there.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.249
But he thinks he has a lead on some woman

11:35.440 --> 11:38.046
who recently visits
the emergency room a lot.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.130
I'm gonna try and cross-reference
facial recog from last night's attack

11:41.280 --> 11:43.442
with the hospital's security footage.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.721
Hey-

11:49.040 --> 11:52.283
At the hospital, you said that you'd
never forgive yourself for what happened.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.487
Andy's working with Darhk.
Has been the entire time.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.327
He helped him find the idol,
helped him out ofjail.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.891
Oliver warned me
but I pretty much told him to go to hell.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.964
Laurel's dead because of me.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.004
<i>I don't know what happened.
I wasn't there.</i>

12:13.800 --> 12:14.926
I don't know what to say.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.730
There's nothing to say.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.090
Thank you for everything at the hospital.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.404
I don't think any of us
were ready to talk to the media.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.969
One of the few advantages
of dating a political operative, I guess.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.441
Sorry, I didn't mean to joke.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.603
Please, I could... I could use some jokes.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.363
Anything to keep my mind off of

12:50.120 --> 12:51.167
everything.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.286
Speaking of, actually, you've...

12:57.120 --> 13:02.160
You never told me why you became
a political operative anyway.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.286
<i>Alex Davis.</i>

13:13.960 --> 13:15.689
You work for them!

13:17.280 --> 13:19.282
What are you talking about?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.845
<i>- Ollie.
- What's going on?</i>

13:51.040 --> 13:54.601
Alex just got attacked by some girl
wearing Laurel's sonic device.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.001
<i>Do you know where she went?</i>

14:17.240 --> 14:19.368
You're dressed like a friend of mine. Why?

14:23.280 --> 14:24.691
Why did you abandon us?

14:25.240 --> 14:28.130
We needed your help
and all you cared about were your friends.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.410
You didn't care about any of us.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.641
What are you talking about...

14:34.040 --> 14:37.362
You left us. You left us at Reddington!

14:38.080 --> 14:39.605
You left us there to die!

14:40.760 --> 14:42.649
You failed this city.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.650
It wasn't Laurel,
but it was sure like seeing a ghost.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.326
And hearing one.
That sonic device has been modified.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.448
My earplugs did not do a thing.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.768
The sonic device is what
shouldn't have done the damn thing.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.247
But you said Cisco keyed it
specifically to Laurel.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.442
It should have only worked with Laurel.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.170
The crazy part is that
this girl is using it

15:15.320 --> 15:17.243
at much higher decibels
than Laurel ever did.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.851
Okay, so who is this girl?

15:19.080 --> 15:21.924
Well, when she attacked Alex,
she accused him of working for someone.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.690
Ruvé Darhk?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.841
HIVE.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.480
<i>She said the Green Arrow
left them at Reddington to die.</i>

15:27.800 --> 15:29.484
- What's Reddington?
- Reddington Industrial

15:29.680 --> 15:31.967
is where Darhk held you all hostage
over the holidays.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.924
You think this girl was one of
HIVE's prisoners?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.685
They weren't prisoners, remember?
They were volunteers.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.446
Right, but still,
let's check missing persons

15:38.640 --> 15:42.361
for a family with at least one teenage
daughter who went missing over Christmas.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.043
The Sharp family.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.681
Mom and Dad's bodies
were found two days after Christmas.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.211
Cause of death, hypoxia.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.329
Could be HIVE's gas chamber...

15:53.520 --> 15:55.045
What about the daughter?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.004
Class president. Academic decathlete.
Gymnast.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.282
Basically, a 16-year-old badass
in the making.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.681
She never even missed a day of school.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.042
Until her parents met Damien Darhk,
I'm guessing.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.403
She said we left them there to die.
And we did.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.563
- What do you mean?
- All those people at Reddington...

16:13.800 --> 16:14.881
Were there of their own choosing, Oliver.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.408
And we know that HIVE drugs people
to make them susceptible to suggestion.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.564
She told me that we've failed this city

16:21.800 --> 16:23.564
and she's not wrong.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.402
Thanks for coming.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.480
I fear I lack the words
to convey the true depths of my sympathy.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.200
To lose a child once is unimaginable.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.323
But for it to be both children...

16:43.680 --> 16:46.604
Listen, I know you and I haven't always
been on the same side of things,

16:46.840 --> 16:49.525
but, uh, Laurel, you know,
she thought of you as a friend...

16:50.680 --> 16:52.728
Just as I thought of her.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.606
She brought me comfort
during a difficult time period.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.729
The world will be a darker place
without her.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.571
Yeah. Well, not for long.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.603
Okay, I got all her things.
What else do I need?

17:02.920 --> 17:04.126
I'm afraid I don't understand.

17:04.359 --> 17:05.281
What else do I have to bring for her

17:05.520 --> 17:08.251
when she comes out of this, you know,
Lazarus Pit thing.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.968
I would do anything for your daughter.

17:12.119 --> 17:14.202
But I destroyed the Pit months ago.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.601
Um...

17:16.200 --> 17:18.726
Okay, well,
there's got to be something else.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.405
I am so very sorry.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.369
So you don't wanna help me?

17:25.440 --> 17:26.566
Fine.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.803
I'll find some other way
to bring her back.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.651
Just scouring traffic cameras for Evelyn,
but I keep striking out.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.405
What are you doing here?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.090
Thinking.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.489
Which is Oliver-speak
for beating yourself up.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.891
I thought you were reformed from that.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.522
Feels like as good a time as any
to bring it back.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.723
Because of Laurel
or because of what that girl said?

17:57.960 --> 17:59.166
Bit of both.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.170
I tried to do the right thing
and I came up short.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.209
I came up short for that girl

18:10.480 --> 18:11.811
and for Laurel.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.531
I mean, maybe I shouldn't
feel responsible, but I do.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.527
Yeah. It's going around.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.165
You mean John?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.326
No, I mean me.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.721
John was looking for someone
to absolve him,

18:25.680 --> 18:30.163
reassure him that what happened
wasn't his fault and I couldn't do it.

18:31.800 --> 18:36.203
I think for a second,
I let him blame himself because

18:36.360 --> 18:38.488
for a minute it saved me from blaming me.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.845
I should have been there.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.762
I wasn't there,
with the team in the bunker.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.844
I know I would have just been behind a
keyboard and I know it seems like hubris,

18:49.040 --> 18:50.326
but I've made a difference before

18:50.560 --> 18:53.245
and I can't help but think
that if I was there...

18:53.520 --> 18:55.443
You know,
maybe she'd still be here.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.522
Do you know why

18:59.720 --> 19:03.611
I always blame myself
in situations like this?

19:05.880 --> 19:07.928
Because at least it's an answer.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.123
Sometimes we just need a reason

19:13.920 --> 19:17.367
when a situation
is completely unreasonable.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.122
<i>- Hello?
- Lyla called asking for John.</i>

19:28.360 --> 19:31.091
Except he's supposed to be
checking in on her.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.810
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.725
I have trackers on all of you.
I'll check and I'll get back to you.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.162
<i>Well, tell those curious</i>

19:44.400 --> 19:48.086
that the city has undertaken to do
a massive upgrade of the sewage system.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.409
I mean, what happens below ground
is simply not their concern.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.160
Why are we stopping?

19:59.400 --> 20:00.561
Get down.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.801
Get out!

20:06.960 --> 20:10.123
What do you think you're doing?
I am the mayor of this city.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.287
I don't care who you are.

20:11.520 --> 20:16.082
You're gonna be a lot less if you don't
get out of that limo right now. Move.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.808
Can I help you with something?

20:22.000 --> 20:25.083
I mean, I always enjoy spending time
with my constituents.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.526
Shut up!

20:26.760 --> 20:27.807
You know who I am.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.368
You know exactly who I am
and you know who my brother is.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.681
I don't know what you're talking about...

20:32.960 --> 20:34.166
Stop lying!

20:35.600 --> 20:37.170
Fine, we'll do this your way.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.842
Maybe you can give your husband
a message for me.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.203
Let him know I'm not playing games
with him anymore.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.880
Argh!

20:45.520 --> 20:47.363
Get away from her, John.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.280
Stay out of my way.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.209
What the hell do you think you're doing?

20:51.440 --> 20:52.362
Trying to find Andy.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.369
By attacking the mayor of the city?

20:54.640 --> 20:56.165
By going after Damien Darhk's wife.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.131
It doesn't matter if she's Darhk's wife.
She is the mayor.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.203
She has the media. She has the police!

21:01.480 --> 21:04.006
I don't give a damn!

21:06.000 --> 21:07.684
I'm so angry, I can hardly breathe.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.167
Every minute he's out there is a...

21:15.680 --> 21:18.081
ls another minute
he can hurt someone I love.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.560
John,

21:20.640 --> 21:21.687
I know.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.891
But this isn't who you are.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.086
I don't know.
I don't know who I am anymore.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.685
Oliver,

21:32.760 --> 21:35.889
all I know is...
All I can hold on to is that...

21:38.320 --> 21:39.526
I have to find my brother.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.723
And do what?

21:42.040 --> 21:46.762
Laurel's gone, and finding Andy
and whatever you're gonna do to him,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.446
it's not gonna bring her back.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.682
But, if she were here,

21:52.080 --> 21:54.560
she'd tell you the same thing
that I'm going to tell you.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.250
You cannot forget who you are.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.249
And we,

22:01.720 --> 22:03.927
we can never become them.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.445
Where have you guys been?

22:32.600 --> 22:33.601
Doesn't matter.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.121
Have we had any luck
tracking down Evelyn Sharp?

22:36.400 --> 22:39.768
No, I keep hitting dead ends.
Not the best choice of words.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.727
News alert.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.362
<i>Tonight, my security detail and I
were attacked</i>

22:46.000 --> 22:51.291
<i>by one of these lawless vigilantes
who claim to protect this city.</i>

22:51.760 --> 22:57.529
<i>This attack came less than 24 hours
after another vigilante,</i>

22:57.760 --> 23:02.607
<i>named the Black Canary,
assaulted my Chief of Staff, Alex Davis.</i>

23:03.800 --> 23:09.807
<i>Now these same masked criminals
were confirmed to be at Iron Heights</i>

23:10.280 --> 23:12.362
<i>when one of this city's</i>

23:12.760 --> 23:13.966
<i>beloved civil servants,</i>

23:14.240 --> 23:17.403
<i>Laurel Lance, was fatally injured.</i>

23:17.600 --> 23:20.251
<i>Well, tonight, I say, no more.</i>

23:20.440 --> 23:23.762
<i>Tonight I asked District Attorney Wallace</i>

23:24.000 --> 23:28.164
<i>to issue arrest warrants
for these so-called vigilantes.</i>

23:28.400 --> 23:32.689
<i>Beginning with Mr. Davis' attacker,
the Black Canary.</i>

23:38.800 --> 23:42.327
<i>We will dedicate
the arrest and prosecution</i>

23:42.520 --> 23:45.285
<i>of this so-called "Black Canary"</i>

23:46.160 --> 23:52.770
<i>to A.D.A. Laurel Lance,
one of this city's brightest lights...</i>

23:53.000 --> 23:54.126
Turn it off.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.321
<i>"RLNE". Thank you.</i>

23:56.320 --> 23:57.606
She knows Laurel was the Black Canary.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.211
And now she has the whole police force

23:59.360 --> 24:02.011
gunning for a scared,
frightened teenage girl.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.043
I'll call Alex.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.130
Okay.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.527
We need to find Evelyn
before the SCPD does.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.961
Yes.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.567
Yeah.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.691
Mr. Lance's agony is understandable,

24:25.880 --> 24:28.963
but its pain is sharpened by denial.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.561
I fear that...
That refusal to accept reality

24:31.720 --> 24:33.563
will lead Mr. Lance
to take desperate action.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.405
Thank you for letting me know.
I will keep an eye on him.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.846
Oliver,

24:39.680 --> 24:41.489
are you all right?

24:43.560 --> 24:47.406
Our friend was killed at the hands of a
man that I am currently powerless to stop

24:48.240 --> 24:52.006
and his wife is dragging her legacy
through the mud.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.842
And after everything she's done,
everything she's stood for,

24:56.080 --> 24:57.525
it just doesn't seem right.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.451
I'm glad you finally decided to come over.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.409
Oh, it's been a week.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.445
I feel like Tommy would be pissed at me

25:14.680 --> 25:17.286
if I didn't eventually
come out of my self-pity.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.522
Yeah.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.521
You know, he loved you so much.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.965
This was right after you won
student body president our senior year.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.442
Do you remember how I won?

25:33.600 --> 25:36.524
Of course. You were
the most deserving candidate by far.

25:38.120 --> 25:42.967
Well, the gift baskets encouraging people
to vote for me, that didn't hurt either.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.925
That was Tommy's idea.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.971
No, but,

25:50.760 --> 25:55.049
seriously, it's easy to buy people off
with money that you didn't even earn.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.722
- You did all the hard work.
- Hmm.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.282
We always did make a great team.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.004
You know, I was thinking about what you
said in the hallway after Tommy's funeral

26:12.240 --> 26:15.847
and wanting to help
make the city a better place.

26:18.680 --> 26:19.920
We still can.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.163
Laurel Lance.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.243
Always trying to save the world.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.640
Yeah, but it doesn't have to be just me.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.081
You can, too.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.851
We can do it together.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.764
I'm really excited
about the future, Ollie.

26:55.800 --> 26:56.961
What do you...

26:57.200 --> 26:58.326
There's no one in there.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.443
It's where the League of Assassins
hang their black hoods.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.524
No, that's right, but there is no
Lazarus Pit and no League in there.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.564
No, but it might be something, just some
clue, all right? Next step on the trail.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.962
There's no trail! Quentin,

27:09.160 --> 27:11.208
Laurel is gone
and there is no bringing her back.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.641
No, no. To hell with that.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.888
And if you don't wanna help me,
to hell with you, too!

27:15.120 --> 27:17.566
- I am helping you.
- No, you're not. Because, you know why?

27:17.720 --> 27:21.042
'Cause you do not know what it is like
to lose a child. No idea.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.890
But I have lost a father.

27:23.160 --> 27:27.370
I have lost a mother
and I have lost Laurel! We have lost her!

27:29.880 --> 27:32.008
We have.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.084
If there was a way, if there was any way

27:37.480 --> 27:41.007
to bring her back,
I would find it and I would do it.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.602
But there isn't, for either of us.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.401
You don't understand.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.602
Right when we lost Sara,
when I became a drunk,

27:56.760 --> 27:58.091
when no one else believed in me, she did.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.601
She's always been there. She's my rock!

28:01.000 --> 28:02.445
All right.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.603
She was my rock.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.770
<i>I can't do this.</i>

28:10.920 --> 28:13.571
Oh, God! Oh, no.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.284
I can't do this.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.450
- John?
- You got something?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.365
Yeah. An apology.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.646
I never should have let you think

28:35.400 --> 28:38.563
that you could have prevented
what happened to Laurel.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.287
Not even for a second. I was just dealing
with my own guilt for not being there.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.324
You have nothing
to be sorry about, Felicity.

28:47.440 --> 28:52.162
If I had listened to Oliver and not
trusted my brother, Laurel would be alive.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.004
No, you don't know that.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.400
Oliver keeps saying the same thing.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.843
Except I keep going through this
over and over again in my head and it...

29:00.560 --> 29:02.005
It's true.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.323
Only thing I don't quite get
is how I could have been so blind.

29:05.480 --> 29:09.451
Well, Andy's your brother, you know?
We make exceptions for family.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.681
Yeah.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.362
And I'm the one constantly telling Oliver
not to have a blind spot for family.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.285
And here you are, taking the blame
for something that's not your fault.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.082
You're just one illegitimate child away

29:22.320 --> 29:24.971
from a really awesome
Oliver Queen impersonation.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.970
Butjust like we tell Oliver,
what happened was not your fault

29:32.080 --> 29:34.082
and Laurel would have wanted you
to know that.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.567
What's that?

29:38.760 --> 29:42.287
Evelyn Sharp. Facial recognition picked
her up outside of Star City Plaza Hotel.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.201
What's she doing there?

29:44.440 --> 29:48.411
That's where Ruvé Darhk is.
She's getting revenge for her family.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.483
Well, if she's gonna kill Ruvé Darhk,
my vote is yes.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.923
It's not just killing Ruvé Darhk.
In that mask, in that costume,

29:54.120 --> 29:55.565
she'd be killing Laurel's legacy.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.805
Hello, pleasure to meet you.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.803
- Excuse me.
- Not right now.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.922
Keep your eyes peeled.
She's out there somewhere.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.610
I'm on site.

30:23.280 --> 30:28.081
Yeah, so is the Anti-Vigilante Task Force
and they've come ready to play.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.645
We need to find that girl before they do.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.371
Hey!

30:32.600 --> 30:33.886
Heading in.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.889
Ma'am. You shouldn't be in here.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.209
Funny,
I was going to tell you the same thing.

30:53.160 --> 30:57.131
The Black Canary is in the building.
I need to get you to a secure location.

30:57.320 --> 31:01.166
Oh, you'll do no such thing. Let her come.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.124
Let her try.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.647
I found her. Second floor. Two hundred
feet from the Liberty Ballroom,

31:06.880 --> 31:08.484
Ruvé Darhk and a lot of innocent people.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.281
On it.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.045
Don't.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.411
Don't go in there.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.846
Get away.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.890
I can't do that.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.561
And you can't do this.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.809
Now, I know you want revenge on HIVE
for what they did to your parents.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.161
But this isn't the way.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.203
It's the only way I have left.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.531
Evelyn, don't.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.121
Argh!

31:55.080 --> 31:56.605
You've failed this city...

31:58.560 --> 32:00.767
I understand that you're trying
to make things right.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.762
<i>That is not how you get justice done.</i>

32:05.000 --> 32:07.321
What did you know
about the real Black Canary?

32:08.520 --> 32:10.807
What did you know
about what she stood for?

32:11.080 --> 32:14.084
She was there that night.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.481
I saw her.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.808
<i>Then you saw what kind of person she was.</i>

32:18.240 --> 32:19.480
She was a hero.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.524
<i>Now, maybe you were wearing that mask
for a reason.</i>

32:25.720 --> 32:28.326
<i>But right now I need you to ask yourself,</i>

32:28.720 --> 32:31.371
what would the Black Canary
want you to do?

32:46.080 --> 32:47.081
<i>Come on.</i>

32:57.800 --> 32:58.847
Arrest him.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.162
I've seen this movie before.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.125
No sign of Evelyn.
Kid must've found out I was tracking her.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.322
I really missed her out there tonight.

33:21.560 --> 33:25.770
In a way, she was out there. In spirit,
I mean. Not in a Lazarus Pit kind of way.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.248
And ultimately, she made the right choice.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.529
I think Laurel would've liked
that she inspired someone.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.006
How can you say that?

33:32.520 --> 33:36.445
Evelyn Sharp just destroyed
Laurel's memory out there tonight.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.803
Now the Black Canary is only gonna be
remembered for whatever Evelyn's done.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.082
Evelyn's not the Black Canary.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.362
Oh, well, to every reporter and person

33:45.560 --> 33:47.449
with a camera in that room tonight,
she was.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.729
Ruvé Darhk's gonna make sure
everybody sees that footage.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.169
As far as
the rest of the world is concerned,

33:54.360 --> 33:58.285
the Black Canary is now a gun-toting,
would-be murderer.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.564
I'm not going to let that happen.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.810
Oh, Quentin,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.128
I never thought we'd be here again.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.206
Me neither.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.409
I figured we were punished enough
first time around.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.043
We were, oh,

34:17.320 --> 34:21.803
at least for a while,
and then Sara came back to us.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.206
I don't think
that's going to happen this time.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.641
How can you say that?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.971
Our girls always come back to us, Quentin.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.248
Yeah, maybe before, but not this time.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.047
I'm sorry, Di, but she's gone.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.608
She's never coming back.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.043
She's...

34:47.400 --> 34:50.563
Mr. Queen has requested
to say a few words.

35:03.480 --> 35:07.041
This, uh...
This doesn't seem right. Uh...

35:08.640 --> 35:11.325
I knew Laurel Lance for

35:13.560 --> 35:15.085
almost her entire life.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.721
She was my friend and I loved her.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.483
Before she died, I was...

35:21.920 --> 35:25.766
I was lucky enough to hear her tell me
that she loved me, too.

35:27.400 --> 35:31.962
Laurel Lance became a lawyer to help
people who may have appeared helpless.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.601
She wanted to give a voice to the silent.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.290
Butjust being a lawyer wasn't enough.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.886
She wanted to do more,

35:41.080 --> 35:43.970
for those people and for this city,

35:44.960 --> 35:46.883
because she loved this city so much.

35:47.760 --> 35:52.288
By now, everyone knows that Laurel was
killed in the Iron Heights prison riot.

35:53.280 --> 35:57.444
And while it's true that she was
an Assistant District Attorney,

35:59.920 --> 36:01.763
that's not what she was doing there
that night.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.289
Before she died, Laurel told me the truth.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.968
Laurel Lance was the Black Canary.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.523
<i>And for the past few days,</i>

36:15.760 --> 36:20.607
I have had to sit and listen to people try
and paint the Black Canary as a criminal.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.121
She was not a criminal. She was a hero.

36:23.800 --> 36:27.725
She was a hero in every way
that a person can be.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.929
<i>And if Laurel were here,</i>

36:31.200 --> 36:35.922
I know that she would expect all of us
to live up to the example that she set.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.923
She'd want us to save our city.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.322
<i>Dear Laurel, I wrote this letter</i>

37:10.520 --> 37:13.683
<i>because I don't have the courage
to see the disappointment on your face.</i>

37:14.200 --> 37:16.362
<i>I know you're going to go on
to do amazing things,</i>

37:16.560 --> 37:18.767
<i>to help people and to raise this city up.</i>

37:19.000 --> 37:21.321
<i>Because that's who you are,
it's who you've always been.</i>

37:21.760 --> 37:23.649
<i>And that's why I have to go</i> away.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.405
<i>I would only hold you back.</i>

37:25.600 --> 37:27.045
<i>You're the hero, Laurel.</i>

37:27.240 --> 37:28.765
<i>Maybe I'll come back eventually,</i>

37:28.960 --> 37:31.645
<i>but for now I have to spend
some time alone.</i>

37:31.840 --> 37:34.161
<i>I hope someday
you'll understand my decision.</i>

37:34.520 --> 37:36.170
<i>Never doubt my love for you.</i>

37:36.360 --> 37:38.203
<i>You've always seen the best in me</i>

37:38.440 --> 37:40.568
<i>because you've always been the best of me.</i>

37:41.040 --> 37:42.565
<i>All my love, Oliver.</i>

38:03.760 --> 38:05.250
I'm sorry I missed the funeral.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.411
- Zoom?
- Yeah.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.603
There was a time,
I would have thought this was my fault.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.208
That I brought this darkness upon us.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.609
<i>Now I know it's not my fault.</i>

38:15.880 --> 38:17.291
It's my responsibility.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.761
Responsibility to do what?

38:20.200 --> 38:21.201
To end it.

38:22.320 --> 38:23.731
I'm gonna kill him.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.365
Is there anything I can do?

38:26.280 --> 38:27.930
I want to be left alone.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.485
Are you okay?

39:28.000 --> 39:29.001
Are you?

39:33.280 --> 39:34.441
No.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.608
You know what you have to do, right?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.444
You have to kill
this son of a bitch.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.850
I know.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.450
I don't know how.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.046
Because of his magic.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.926
His... It's too strong.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.045
I've seen it before,

39:58.880 --> 40:03.920
back on Lian Yu, and it is not just magic.

40:06.520 --> 40:07.681
It's darkness.

40:08.280 --> 40:12.524
And whenever I have come up against it,
I have gone nowhere.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.724
He feels unstoppable.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.610
I refuse to believe that.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.531
And I refuse to let you believe that.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.927
If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.051
I fell in love with you for many reasons
and one of those reasons is,

40:32.280 --> 40:37.241
is that you always find a way,
and you have to find a way now.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.364
<i>For Laurel. For the city.</i>

40:44.800 --> 40:45.801
For all of us.
