WEBVTT

00:46.000 --> 00:47.879
What are you doing?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.119
Oh, hello.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.359
Routine maintenance.
It'll just take a mo.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.239
Hang on.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.039
We do
our own maintenance.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.799
What are you doing
at Ian's computer?

01:08.880 --> 01:11.319
That normally works.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.279
You're smart.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.639
DCI Taylor.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.639
We need access to this terminal
under the Terrorism Prevention Act 2011.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.599
This is a warrant...

01:26.880 --> 01:32.119
... and this is a document
pertaining to the Official Secrets Act...

01:32.200 --> 01:34.879
- ... which I'm... I'm gonna need you to sign.
- What?

01:34.960 --> 01:37.319
Terrorism Prevention...

01:38.160 --> 01:41.879
- And if I call the police...?
- Yeah... Of course.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.439
Here...

01:44.440 --> 01:46.279
... use my phone.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.919
The number's 999.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.439
No.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.719
Actually...
I'll use our phones.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.279
If you think that's best.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.879
Yeah.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.639
Yeah, I do!

02:15.320 --> 02:17.479
Knew I'd find it somewhere.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.319
Yeah, it's me.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.239
Things have gone a bit awry.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.279
Yeah. Just one.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.239
I dealt with it.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.759
Well, we could say suicide,
but...

02:56.960 --> 03:00.359
... it'll be a bit of a stretch.
Hold on.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.399
Yeah, suicide's not gonna work.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.759
Becky! It's a long way down, Becky.
I don't think you should jump.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.839
My mum, my mates,
everyone I know...

04:03.920 --> 04:06.719
... they all think I fucking killed myself
cos of you and that bitch Milner!

04:06.800 --> 04:08.799
What have I done to you,
Jessica?

04:08.880 --> 04:12.879
- Mi-e foame. Nu ai de mancare?
- Anton, let's get you out.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.719
- Support V Day.
- It's political suicide.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.279
If you say no-one gets the vaccine
until we all do... so be it.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.919
There's someone they want got rid of.
They want you to do it.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.399
I want to help you, and I believe this is
right, it's just, uh, I don't think I can.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.999
Do you think
I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.599
I've come to find you.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.919
Why?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.919
We need to run.
All of us. Right now.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.119
I made breakfast.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.919
It's brown rice
with pulses and nuts.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.679
It's healthy.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.679
Well, I'm not eating
your food.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.319
It's good you think like that.

05:30.320 --> 05:34.959
No, mate. I'm not eating that,
cos it's fucking pigeon food.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.559
So, you said
they wanted him?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.159
So we can all just go, then?

05:42.240 --> 05:44.039
What? Becky!

05:44.120 --> 05:46.879
They'll have found your DNA
at the factory.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.079
So, what do we do, then?

05:50.480 --> 05:54.159
He knows something.
If we want to live...

05:54.240 --> 05:58.559
- ... we need to find out what he knows.
- And why are you helping us?

05:58.640 --> 06:01.439
I'm turning over a new leaf.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.479
Ti-am facut tie...
mamei tale...

06:07.560 --> 06:10.159
Oh, just fuck off,
you dirty old nodger!

06:10.240 --> 06:13.159
- He likes you. It's good.
- Yeah? And you're a psycho, mate.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.479
Are you sure it's not Anton
they wanted dead?

06:15.560 --> 06:19.319
He knows all about Deel's.
You. Sprechen Sie Deutsch?

06:19.960 --> 06:22.519
- FranÃ§ais?
- They knew nothing about him.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.439
They would've taken the decision
to neutralise you within days.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.799
- Please don't say "neutralise".
- What have you done in that time?

06:29.880 --> 06:31.319
What have you done
in the last few days?

06:31.400 --> 06:33.319
- What have you been up to?
- Look, I'm not an idiot.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.319
I've kept my head down.
I haven't done anything that...

06:40.760 --> 06:43.719
Well, I did see someone.
But he was drunk.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.399
His name is Gorski, Dobry Gorski.
My old professor.

06:50.480 --> 06:55.119
I went to see him on Tuesday
to ask about Tony, but he was totally drunk.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.359
- Was he ever with The Network?
- Yeah, but he was out years ago.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.999
He's dead.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.439
Dobry Gorski.
I just googled him.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.079
Was hit-and-run
this morning.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.799
What did he say to you?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.519
Nothing that made any sense.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.559
What did he say?

07:32.160 --> 07:33.919
He just said...

07:34.800 --> 07:36.919
... "Jimmy Deeshel...

07:37.000 --> 07:39.079
... is a fat man."

07:39.600 --> 07:41.239
What?

07:41.840 --> 07:45.159
"Jimmy Deeshel is a fat man."

07:47.080 --> 07:50.879
- That's it.
- Who the fuck is Jimmy Deeshel?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.119
No-one.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.439
There's no Jimmy Deeshel.
It's not even a name.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.359
I googled it!

07:56.440 --> 07:58.439
You googled it?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.999
And someone
tried to kill you?

08:02.640 --> 08:08.039
I would suggest no-one googles anything
from now on.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.239
I know someone who can help us.
Let's clean up and go.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.479
This is insane.
It's fucking nuts.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.479
Becky?

08:42.360 --> 08:44.839
Look, what the fuck
do you want?

08:52.840 --> 08:55.719
Right, that's everything back in place
as best it can be.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.679
- We're ready to go.
- I missed you.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.559
I fucking missed you.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.759
I used to check CCTV feeds,
missing persons...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.439
I'd walk out of the office
in the middle of a meeting...

09:10.520 --> 09:13.119
... just in case
you happened to be passing.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.439
Every second I missed you.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.679
And what do you say
when you see me?

09:17.760 --> 09:19.559
"What the fuck
do you want?"

09:19.640 --> 09:24.519
- Right, well, when you put it like that...
- Where is Jessica Hyde?

09:28.840 --> 09:30.359
We don't know.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.159
She had the manuscript,
she took it to Milner.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.759
- That's the last we saw of her.
- Who's Milner?

09:34.840 --> 09:36.719
Ml5. She was on our side.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.999
There are no sides, just people
who help you and people who don't.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.319
Yeah?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.599
And which one are you?
Why the fuck are we trusting you?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.639
- Ian, I don't...
- We don't know who he is!

09:48.720 --> 09:51.319
He killed four men yesterday.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.959
How do we know they weren't there
to rescue us from him?

09:54.040 --> 09:55.879
All this is over,
The Network is finished...

09:55.960 --> 09:58.439
... and now you come along
and you say that they're after us?

09:58.520 --> 10:02.639
But how do we know that?
How do we really fucking know that?

10:02.720 --> 10:05.879
Um... I think
I can answer that.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.799
Police have identified
the suspect as Ian Johnson.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.999
The victim, Joe Ducasor,
an office manager from Peckham...

10:14.080 --> 10:18.279
... was brutally murdered in what police
are describing as "a frenzied attack".

10:18.360 --> 10:21.679
CCTV footage shows
Johnson slashing the victim's throat...

10:21.760 --> 10:24.039
... before fleeing the scene.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.959
You okay?

10:52.040 --> 10:53.959
Joe was a cock.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.919
He was a real cock.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.639
- So...
- We've got a car.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.479
It's nice.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.879
- You can sit with me, Becky.
- Yeah.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.319
Or I could just fucking not.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.279
I can't explain that.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.159
All right.
All right, I can explain it.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.279
I slept with him.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.839
Once.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.359
I'd just found out
I had Deel's...

11:29.440 --> 11:32.519
... he knew all about it,
I was at a very low ebb.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.959
It will never happen again...

11:35.040 --> 11:37.679
... and just thinking about it
makes me want a vagina transplant.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.559
So I'm just fucking telling you,
all right?

11:49.840 --> 11:52.239
It means us waiting
a few months for the vaccine...

11:52.320 --> 11:54.919
.... so that they
don't have to wait decades.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.599
Isn't that worth it?
Support V Day.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.919
Say, "No, not this time."

12:05.840 --> 12:08.719
I asked to see her.
Why can't I see her?

12:08.800 --> 12:13.319
- Because you're seeing me, dear.
- V Day is political suicide.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.599
I'm on my way to be...

12:18.240 --> 12:21.239
I can be PM.

12:21.320 --> 12:26.559
- Now, imagine how useful I could be if...
- We don't need you to be PM, Geoff.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.639
We need you to announce
that you're backing V Day.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.759
We need it tonight.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.239
Just do what you're told.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.479
- Please.
- What is going on?

12:37.560 --> 12:40.319
Where in God's name is she?
Why isn't she here?

12:40.400 --> 12:42.119
She's...

12:43.240 --> 12:45.039
... busy.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.079
She's not moved.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.079
It's been eight hours
and she's not moved a muscle.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.999
We have fabricated
a worldwide flu scare.

13:06.080 --> 13:11.079
We are about to manufacture
enough vaccine to inoculate the planet.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.999
But because
you have kept us waiting...

13:14.080 --> 13:17.839
... we now have just under three months
in which to do that.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.519
It's just about...
just about possible.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.759
I wanted her to talk.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.759
- I thought she...
- Geoff announces V Day at 9pm.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.479
It's a starting pistol.
It's a big red button with "go" on it.

13:33.560 --> 13:38.639
If Philip made an adjustment to Janus,
we must know today.

13:39.720 --> 13:43.559
Let us operate.
Let us go inside her brain.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.679
Tomorrow will be too late.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.439
She's all I have left of him.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.319
Jessica...

14:04.800 --> 14:07.279
We're taking you
somewhere else.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.519
I think we should be taking
pieces of the optic nerve and chiasma...

14:34.600 --> 14:37.039
... and the medulla
and the brain stem.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.559
The optic nerve? Really?

14:39.640 --> 14:42.039
I mean, if we're going to be
in there anyway.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.359
We could even take
the dorsal surface of the thalamus.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.199
So, this is a very powerful sedative,
Jessica.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.159
- Why am I bothering?
- Oh, no, no, no.

14:56.240 --> 15:00.039
I'm not using these haemostats.
These are a mess.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.599
- Do you want me to call the guard?
- Why wake him?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.399
I just think the basic standards
of hygiene in this place...

15:28.480 --> 15:31.119
... are not at all
what they should be.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.839
Did you see what I did to him?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.919
He's drowning in there.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.439
I didn't need to go that far.

15:58.280 --> 16:03.199
But I did to show you what I'm willing
to do if you don't co-operate.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.319
Are you going to co-operate?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.439
Yeah.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.319
I need a back way.
Is there one?

16:15.360 --> 16:17.319
Are you thinking?
Think fast.

16:19.960 --> 16:24.559
It's through those doors there,
at the top of the stairs.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.719
- Go on, then.
- What...?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.679
What's down there?

16:57.760 --> 16:59.799
It's medical waste.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.759
You know,
blood, tissue, body parts...

17:06.600 --> 17:07.679
... soil pans.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.719
No, no, no.
Please, please, please...

17:09.800 --> 17:12.679
The-the dose, it has to be precise.
It's very strong.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.279
Please...

17:14.360 --> 17:17.839
What part of my brain
were you going to take again?

18:19.240 --> 18:23.999
Oh, look, it's that one-eyed freak
who shot me in my lung.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.399
Yeah, well,
you pulled my eye out...

18:29.480 --> 18:31.399
Just doing my job.

18:34.920 --> 18:39.559
Besides, you've got a nice,
new, pirate-y look out of it.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.719
All I got was partial paralysis.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.759
- So we're even, then?
- Even?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.519
Oh, no.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.599
Not by a long shot.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.519
Christian Donaldson is on the run
with Becky, Ian and Grant.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.439
- What?
- You need to go with Lee, find them.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.999
Me, with him?
Are you insane?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.799
You know them. Besides,
they may come to you, you were friends.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.519
We're not friends now.
And he is a fucking psychopath!

19:09.600 --> 19:11.719
- Wilson...
- But me, with him?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.919
Wilson, please!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.199
Take care of this for me.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.999
I have other things
to focus on.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.999
- Don't worry, Wilson.
- Whoa!

19:23.080 --> 19:25.119
We'll make a great team,
you and me.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.639
I can do stuff,
and you can keep an eye out.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.759
Are you all right driving,
Wilson?

19:34.840 --> 19:39.119
Only one eye...
Don't you need to re-apply for your licence?

19:39.200 --> 19:41.559
That's not how it works.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.919
You need to inform the DVLA
if you have a visual impairment...

19:45.000 --> 19:46.519
... and they will test you...

19:46.600 --> 19:49.199
... and decide whether or not
you are fit to drive.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.559
In the majority of cases,
it doesn't affect your licence.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.519
- You did all that, then?
- No.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.319
I've never had a licence.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.959
What I like about you, Wilson,
is the amount of stuff you know.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.919
- All of it fucking useless.
- Knowledge is never useless.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.759
Weren't much use
when I got my spoon out, was it?

20:11.080 --> 20:13.519
Or when I killed your dad.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.919
This person will help us
if he doesn't know I'm out.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.919
If he does know,
he'll try and call them.

20:59.000 --> 21:03.919
If that happens, get the boy out.
There's things he shouldn't see.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.759
Is Ben home, please?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.639
Ben!

21:14.720 --> 21:17.079
Some friends for you!

21:18.040 --> 21:22.239
- Are you all friends of Ben, then?
- Yes. Friends.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.719
Right...
Yeah, we're... we're doing that thing.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.879
Perhaps we should talk
in private.

21:38.760 --> 21:43.559
- Mum, have you seen my phone?
- Well, where did you leave it, then?

21:44.360 --> 21:45.679
Here it is!

21:51.080 --> 21:54.799
An honour.
The inner sanctum.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.439
You're so
fucking embarrassing!

22:13.400 --> 22:16.039
- He's a kid!
- A smart kid.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.879
He's with a hacking collective
and he'll help us.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.639
We're popping out now, love.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.359
We've left some food
on the table downstairs.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.919
- It's just cold...
- Just leave us the fuck alone!

22:30.600 --> 22:33.239
- Is there food down there?
- Help yourself, blood.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.119
Thanks... blood.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.839
Oh, by the way,
if you want to steal anything -

22:38.920 --> 22:42.199
... money, jewellery, TV -
go for it.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.479
I fucking hate them!

22:46.160 --> 22:49.639
We're looking for someone.
Jimmy Deeshel.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.119
What? What did you say?

22:54.200 --> 22:56.719
It's not Jimmy Deeshel.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.279
It's Jimmy Deesh...L.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.439
The letter L.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.119
Jimmy Deesh was the nickname
for a bio-weapons programme...

23:04.200 --> 23:07.119
... the Americans had in the '60s.
Very top secret.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.719
L equals a project.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.799
Jimmy Deesh A, Jimmy Deesh B.

23:11.880 --> 23:15.239
What you're looking for
is Jimmy Deesh, Project L.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.279
And can you find out
what it is?

23:18.360 --> 23:22.439
Well... that is some
real dark-web infiltrating...

23:22.520 --> 23:24.879
... deep underground...

23:27.400 --> 23:29.359
Yes. Yes, I can.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.239
This is deep.

23:38.840 --> 23:42.559
This project... I can't get near this.
This Project L is...

23:43.640 --> 23:45.399
Oh, my God.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.399
Oh my...

23:47.480 --> 23:49.199
Oh, my God!

23:51.600 --> 23:53.719
Who the fuck
are you people?

23:56.240 --> 23:59.239
Oh, I gotta get me
some more of this.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.279
- It's beautiful.
- Oscar, this is slowing us down.

24:14.360 --> 24:19.079
Hey, sexy, how would you like
an all-access pass to my bedroom?

24:19.160 --> 24:21.159
Care to find out
if those kinky...

24:21.240 --> 24:24.079
... naughty, dirty, nasty things I do
behind closed doors...

24:24.160 --> 24:27.479
- Oh, no, not you again!
- Come and meet my new friend.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.759
- Isn't she gorgeous?
- Oi!

24:31.760 --> 24:34.279
What are you doing,
you dickhead?

24:45.240 --> 24:46.639
Got it!

24:46.720 --> 24:48.879
Fuck me, I got it!

24:49.840 --> 24:51.759
This is some big-shit stuff,
you know?

24:51.840 --> 24:54.999
I mean, that was buried, man!
That was really...

24:55.080 --> 24:56.679
Okay. Um...

24:56.760 --> 25:01.439
Project L was something
Jimmy Deesh was working on in 1968.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.999
Now, bear in mind these are the same
psychos that weaponised Ebola.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.759
But whatever Project L was,
it scared them so much...

25:08.840 --> 25:10.479
... they didn't even test it.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.079
I mean, once they created it,
they just shit themselves.

25:13.160 --> 25:18.479
- And what was Project L?
- All I know is it was an H1N5 virus.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.559
So... flu, I guess.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.919
Mate, you people are serious.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.479
I totally need a shit.

25:27.560 --> 25:31.159
Did your friend say,
"Is a fat man," or, "Is fat man"?

25:31.240 --> 25:33.319
What does that matter?

25:33.400 --> 25:36.959
Did he say Jimmy Deesh L
"is a fat man" or just "is fat man"?

25:37.040 --> 25:38.799
Er, no, he said,
"Is fat man."

25:38.880 --> 25:41.159
But so what? He's Polish.
They don't use prepositions.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.399
Ian? What is it?
What is "fat man"?

25:44.480 --> 25:47.999
"Fat Man" was the name of the bomb
they released on Nagasaki.

25:48.680 --> 25:53.319
Of course,
with so many videos going viral...

25:53.400 --> 25:57.159
... many ad agencies are trying
to cash in on the phenomenon.

25:57.240 --> 26:01.359
What was once seen as the preserve
of geeks and internet humorists...

26:01.440 --> 26:04.079
... is now becoming
big business...

26:08.440 --> 26:09.839
Pansh familii!

26:11.760 --> 26:13.879
- Anton?
- Pansh familii!

26:14.560 --> 26:16.559
Acesta este Ã®nceputul!

26:17.360 --> 26:19.079
Pansh familii!

26:21.240 --> 26:24.399
Janus...
You're all going to die.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.759
I didn't do nothing, Becky!
He's mental.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.879
He turned on the news
and he just flipped.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.639
What?

28:18.240 --> 28:20.079
Jessica's gone.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.439
But... we have to find her.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.479
We've got to get her back.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.639
We're not going to find her.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.719
It took me 35 years
to find her.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.719
We are never, ever
going to find Jessica Hyde!

28:36.080 --> 28:37.599
You had her.

28:37.680 --> 28:42.599
You had her for five months
and you did nothing, because of what?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.839
- Sentiment.
- Don't push me, Leah.

28:44.920 --> 28:49.199
Because of who her father was
and how you felt about him.

28:56.040 --> 28:56.679
What are you doing?

28:56.760 --> 28:58.879
- I'm calling Geoff.
- I can fix this, please.

28:58.960 --> 29:02.839
- I'm telling him not to announce.
- No. No, wait. Let me think.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.119
What is there to think about?

29:04.200 --> 29:06.199
There isn't another version of this
waiting in the wings!

29:06.280 --> 29:10.559
There isn't another Geoff or another
flu scare or another vaccine or virus!

29:10.640 --> 29:12.519
This is it!

29:29.520 --> 29:31.599
- Are you all right, Michael?
- Oh, hi, Bridget.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.319
You look like
a dog ate your sandwich.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.999
Got no idea
what I'm doing here.

29:36.880 --> 29:40.079
Well, I think you're doing...

29:40.160 --> 29:42.359
... really, really well.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.559
Um... the Russian flu vaccine...

29:48.640 --> 29:51.199
Remember last week
we had to postpone the tests...

29:51.280 --> 29:53.639
... because there was an issue
with the SOPs?

29:53.720 --> 29:57.079
Well, the results have all come back,
and they are all stamped and dated...

29:57.160 --> 29:58.519
... everything is fine,
blah, blah, blah.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.799
But the watermark dates
say Wednesday.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.119
And the tests
happened on Thursday.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.239
Oh. They must've got
the dates wrong.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.679
Well, that's not possible because
the system is linked to an atomic clock.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.199
It was a big publicity thing
about a year ago.

30:14.280 --> 30:18.239
- So they just can't be wrong.
- So... why is it wrong?

30:18.320 --> 30:21.359
Well, that's why
you're paid the big bucks.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.439
This vaccine thing...
it's sorted.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.999
I mean,
I've got somebody onto it, so...

30:36.080 --> 30:38.079
You know, let's not...

30:39.240 --> 30:41.159
Let's leave it.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.639
You and me.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.359
I mean, until I... know more.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.879
Right.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.679
But I... I do know more.

30:51.760 --> 30:57.199
I pulled the previous reports
on the vaccine over the last 18 months.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.039
Specifically
the thermal stability observation.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.719
And it's weird.

31:02.800 --> 31:07.759
Okay? So it's represented
by a number between 1 and 900...

31:07.840 --> 31:11.639
... taken every 18 days, right?

31:11.720 --> 31:14.199
So it's all... fine.

31:14.280 --> 31:18.159
It's just that when I compared it
to other vaccines...

31:18.240 --> 31:20.959
... there was an exact match.

31:21.040 --> 31:24.319
Hong Kong flu, 1969.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.519
- So, what, is that unusual?
- No. It's impossible!

31:30.600 --> 31:33.879
Someone must have taken
the Hong Kong flu results...

31:33.960 --> 31:36.639
... and used them to fake the results
for the Russian flu.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.359
This is... serious, Michael.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.399
- This is really serious.
- Wait. Hang on.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.599
- Let me... Let me look at that.
- Okay.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.399
Ah, right, well...

31:50.480 --> 31:52.839
I see what's happened here.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.599
I-I hate to tell you, but, er,
you're mistaken.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.079
- Oh. Am I?
- Yes.

32:06.160 --> 32:11.359
This... this actually is
the same, er, vaccine.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.159
See, you've-you've...

32:15.240 --> 32:19.359
... you've pulled the observations
for Hong Kong flu.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.719
Oh, yes.

32:29.800 --> 32:33.039
My mistake.
W-What an idiot!

32:44.320 --> 32:47.439
I want you
to stay away from this!

32:47.960 --> 32:50.399
You're scaring me, Michael.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.519
But, please, j-just...

32:53.080 --> 32:56.279
Look, there are things going on.
I can't tell you.

32:56.360 --> 33:00.799
Just...
don't get involved, please?

33:00.880 --> 33:03.319
Okay. Um... That...

33:04.240 --> 33:06.159
... might be a bit late.

33:06.240 --> 33:11.799
I managed to get a sample of the vaccine,
and I'm running tests on it now.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.839
How the fuck
did you get a sample?

33:16.920 --> 33:18.879
Cleverness?

33:27.760 --> 33:29.479
Breadcrumbs.

33:33.880 --> 33:36.159
I know where he's going.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.279
So...

33:43.360 --> 33:45.319
... you can pickpocket.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.879
Handy.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.879
And I can see this time.

33:48.960 --> 33:52.679
And I can put a bullet
right in your head.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.039
Did you really kill my dad?

34:07.680 --> 34:10.799
Oh, yeah.
It was me, all right.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.839
Why are you
telling me that?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.679
I put it somewhere.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.159
Oh, there it is.

34:20.240 --> 34:21.879
Right.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.799
You know what you are?

34:36.880 --> 34:38.999
You're a believer.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.839
That's why she likes you.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.759
It's not
that you can't take life...

35:12.520 --> 35:16.279
... I reckon you could take billions,
but...

35:17.160 --> 35:19.959
... it would have
to be necessary.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.039
Killing me just...

35:22.640 --> 35:25.279
... isn't necessary.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.479
No... No, don't...

35:31.560 --> 35:33.239
Don't!

35:33.320 --> 35:35.799
Don't hurt them!

35:54.000 --> 35:56.399
There are things
I need to see to.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.679
Meet me here... tonight.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.719
Be careful.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.519
He is just... charming.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.439
I need new identities
for three people.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.959
Old identities totally erased.
Can you do that?

36:32.040 --> 36:33.999
Me? Er...

36:34.080 --> 36:36.559
I can do birth certs.
I can do passports...

36:36.640 --> 36:40.879
... I have a programme that plunders
databases so thoroughly...

36:43.760 --> 36:45.479
Sure.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.399
Come back tonight.

36:50.840 --> 36:54.639
So all this time
they had a real virus?

36:54.720 --> 36:57.839
- Russian flu is real?
- Yes, it's real.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.919
And they're going
"Fat Man" on it...

37:00.000 --> 37:02.879
.... which is how they get a whole planet
to take their vaccine.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.999
And if the results of the fake outbreak
are modelled on the real thing...

37:06.080 --> 37:08.199
... think Spanish flu or worse.

37:08.280 --> 37:10.359
And was that one bad?
The Spanish one?

37:10.440 --> 37:13.279
It killed
50 million people, Grant.

37:13.360 --> 37:17.079
Besides, we ought to be working
on the bigger question here, hm?

37:17.160 --> 37:19.279
Who the fuck's he?

37:19.360 --> 37:21.639
Grant, you said he spoke English.
Does he speak English?

37:21.720 --> 37:23.279
Hey, you.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.679
Why are we going to die?

37:28.760 --> 37:31.199
Nai manush san!

37:31.280 --> 37:33.319
It's lovely, fantastic!

37:33.400 --> 37:35.599
Who are you?
What do you mean...

37:35.680 --> 37:40.359
- "Janus. You're all going to die"?
- Oi! He's old!

37:40.440 --> 37:42.119
No, he's someone, okay?
He knows stuff!

37:42.200 --> 37:46.079
- Why don't you just leave him alone?
- Because people are trying to kill me.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.399
Because they're going to do
a Nagasaki with a flu virus!

37:48.480 --> 37:52.479
You were told to leave it,
so back the fuck off.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.479
I see.

37:56.560 --> 38:00.479
Fine, it's fine, perfectly fine.
I'll just go and stand over here, shall I?

38:00.560 --> 38:03.079
Wait for someone to kill me,
shoot me in the fucking face...

38:03.160 --> 38:05.159
... because you're all pals?

38:27.720 --> 38:30.199
Ian! Ian, quick!

38:33.920 --> 38:35.599
What?

38:37.920 --> 38:39.999
Did he do those?

38:51.160 --> 38:52.519
Did he see it?
Is he copying them?

38:52.600 --> 38:55.639
No. No, he's not copying,
he's...

38:55.720 --> 38:58.719
This is the house
we were at this morning...

38:58.800 --> 39:02.399
... and that one's Grant.
And... look at this.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.839
Fucking hell.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.959
Is he...?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.839
Philip?

39:15.920 --> 39:18.519
Philip Carvel?

39:25.520 --> 39:27.839
Oh, my fucking fuck!

39:35.120 --> 39:37.159
But I thought he was dead.

39:37.720 --> 39:42.439
- Everyone thinks he's dead.
- Well, he's not, is he?

39:42.520 --> 39:45.799
He's here, sat in our car,
sketching.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.599
It's not our car.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.439
- Well, I'm just saying. It's...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

39:50.520 --> 39:52.999
You're getting pedantic now?

39:53.080 --> 39:55.199
Should we call Milner?

39:55.840 --> 39:59.359
- Becky, should we call Milner?
- Listen, I don't know what's going on...

39:59.440 --> 40:03.959
... but Milner said that all this was over,
and it turns out that that's bullshit.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.959
And him...

40:06.040 --> 40:08.399
... he made my disease.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.919
He created it.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.999
I don't wanna give him to anyone
unless I'm sure.

40:16.360 --> 40:20.239
I think we should keep this
between us, Ian.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.399
Me and you.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.039
For now.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.119
All right, then.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.599
Just me and you.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.999
And I did miss you.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.959
It fu... it fucking hurt,
actually.

40:40.600 --> 40:44.479
Getting on that train
was the worst decision that I ever made.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.879
I just wanted to say...

41:12.640 --> 41:14.759
... very big of you.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.479
Understanding me and Becky.
Our past.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.199
Becky has told me everything.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.359
And if you think some sordid little
bunk-up years ago means anything to me...

41:23.440 --> 41:27.639
- ... you've seriously misjudged me.
- Oh, I wasn't talking about the "bunk-up".

41:28.240 --> 41:30.599
No, I was talking about
the way...

41:30.680 --> 41:32.839
... Becky was trying to get
the manuscript to me, you know?

41:32.920 --> 41:35.519
Um, when she was with you
all that time.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.799
The way she was secretly
working with me...

41:37.880 --> 41:41.839
... to try and get the manuscript
away from you.

41:41.920 --> 41:46.639
I just think it is great
that you can forgive her, that's all.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.839
- So you got it from this?
- Yeah.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.239
It's just a nut from the machine
that moves the tubs...

42:05.320 --> 42:07.679
... but because it doesn't come into contact
with the vaccine...

42:07.760 --> 42:09.919
... it's not subject
to the same security.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.919
And there was a study done last year
that said that it was possible...

42:13.000 --> 42:17.479
... for vaccine aerosols
to contaminate mechanical workings.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.319
So I had a look,
and we were lucky.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.079
And you can test it here?

42:24.160 --> 42:27.119
Yeah.
I've always had a home lab.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.519
I was born geek!

42:33.600 --> 42:35.239
I'm sorry, Bridget.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.519
I-I'm sorry
you got caught up in this.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.639
You seem like such a...

42:43.200 --> 42:47.399
- ... good person.
- Shut up. You'll make me blush!

42:49.280 --> 42:53.959
Actually, don't shut up.
I really like it when you say nice things to me.

43:02.080 --> 43:06.439
Saved by the haemagglutinin-sensitised
erythrocytes!

43:08.680 --> 43:12.399
Right...
Let's see, let's... see...

43:12.480 --> 43:17.199
Okay, yeah, yes.
That's all good...

43:18.160 --> 43:20.519
Fuck, what's this?

43:20.600 --> 43:22.799
I think
there's something in here.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.439
What?

43:24.960 --> 43:28.639
What's in there?
There shouldn't be anything in there.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.199
Well... there is.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.999
I think it's... a protein,
but it's not one I've seen before.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.559
Oh, my God.
There is something in here.

43:43.440 --> 43:46.159
Right. Right, you just...
you just wait here.

43:46.240 --> 43:50.359
You... Don't call anyone, don't go online.
You just... just wait there for me.

43:50.440 --> 43:53.439
D-D... But... Michael?

43:53.520 --> 43:55.799
Are we gonna be okay?

44:31.920 --> 44:34.359
We can't just sit here.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.919
Hello?

44:44.520 --> 44:45.919
Milner, it's me.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.239
Ian?

44:49.080 --> 44:51.759
- Ian, are you okay?
- I don't know who to trust.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.279
- I thought I could trust...
- Ian, listen.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.239
This phone isn't set up
to trace calls.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.439
I can't help you
unless you tell me where you are.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.439
Ian?

45:02.480 --> 45:06.199
Please!
The Network are running again.

45:06.280 --> 45:09.159
They've just started
manufacturing the vaccine.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.159
- Dugdale's with them.
- Dugdale?

45:14.800 --> 45:16.399
We have Philip Carvel.

45:16.480 --> 45:20.959
- Carvel's dead...
- No, he's alive and he's here.

45:22.400 --> 45:26.599
- No. No, no. That can't be...
- Philip Carvel is alive!

45:31.120 --> 45:32.999
Philip's alive?

45:38.680 --> 45:40.999
Ian, let me protect you.

45:41.920 --> 45:44.359
You're in great danger
where you are.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.359
You, Becky, Grant.
You're all in danger.

45:46.440 --> 45:49.159
- Let me help you.
- What do you mean, "Becky"?

45:52.320 --> 45:54.559
I didn't say Becky was with us.

45:54.640 --> 45:57.759
Yes, you did.
You said, "Becky".

46:09.920 --> 46:12.359
Tell Geoff to announce V Day.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.759
Everything's going to be fine.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.839
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much for coming.

46:29.920 --> 46:30.919
Please do have a seat.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.759
I have an important
and an exciting announcement to make.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.759
... American Secretary of State
said...

46:46.840 --> 46:50.959
... that China must not be allowed to turn
its wheat crisis into a military crisis.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.359
But extended rain
coupled with...

47:14.400 --> 47:16.439
Well, I'm alive.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.719
So I'm assuming
this is a negotiation?

47:20.800 --> 47:22.719
I want to trade.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.079
I have Christian Donaldson
and the others.

47:28.240 --> 47:32.199
But I want
Amanda and Tess safe.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.719
Really?

47:35.200 --> 47:37.719
This is about those two?

47:37.800 --> 47:41.599
I've new identities.
Only I know them now.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.239
When it's done...

47:45.320 --> 47:47.079
... I'm coming for you.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.839
Fair enough, matey.

47:48.920 --> 47:52.799
But you should know,
I'm more important than I was.

47:52.880 --> 47:55.159
I can bring you back in.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.359
That's all this is about.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.399
Bringing you home.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.159
We need to talk.
