00:02.042 --> 00:03.500
It's great to have
you back, captain.

00:03.583 --> 00:05.833
Thanks. It's good to be back.

00:05.917 --> 00:06.917
You know, I was
starting to think

00:07.000 --> 00:08.708
I'd never get out of that place.

00:08.792 --> 00:11.417
Well, I wasn't worried.
I knew they couldn't hold you.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.333
Well, that makes one of us.

00:14.417 --> 00:17.583
So you never told me
how you got back here

00:17.667 --> 00:20.000
after you escaped.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.250
What's to tell?

00:21.333 --> 00:23.208
I sent word
to the Mars Resistance

00:23.292 --> 00:25.083
arranged for a pickup.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.625
'Who did you work through?'

00:28.708 --> 00:32.417
- My contact?
- Yes, your contact.

00:34.292 --> 00:36.208
Uh, it's, uh..

00:39.500 --> 00:41.542
We-we don't use names.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.875
Codes, then?

00:45.625 --> 00:46.917
Just..

00:48.292 --> 00:50.458
...numbers.

00:50.542 --> 00:52.875
(Stephen)
It must be difficult
having a conversation.

00:52.958 --> 00:56.042
How you doing, Number One?
Have a good sleep, Number Two?

00:56.125 --> 00:59.667
It's a necessary evil, uh,
but you should know that.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.125
You were there.

01:01.208 --> 01:03.292
You know..

01:03.375 --> 01:05.000
...I can't believe
that they really think

01:05.083 --> 01:08.167
that this whole campaign
against Earth was our idea.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.375
Why shouldn't they?

01:09.458 --> 01:10.875
You weren't really to blame.

01:10.958 --> 01:13.750
It was the alien governments
who influenced you.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.542
No.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.292
That's, that's not
what happened.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.042
Well, as you can see

01:23.125 --> 01:25.500
even though we've distorted
his sense of reality

01:25.583 --> 01:29.333
he still remains uncooperative
despite the drugs.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.167
I'm going to increase
the dosage by 10%

01:31.250 --> 01:32.792
and see if that
makes a difference.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.792
- What about his father?
- What about him?

01:35.875 --> 01:38.042
If we bring him in and threaten
to put a bullet in his head

01:38.125 --> 01:39.792
it might encourage him
to cooperate.

01:39.875 --> 01:42.125
No, it doesn't work.

01:42.208 --> 01:44.333
If he doesn't turn
and we kill his father

01:44.417 --> 01:46.958
it only strengthens his resolve.

01:47.042 --> 01:48.917
'If we threaten to kill
his father and we don't'

01:49.000 --> 01:50.583
'it only weakens our position.'

01:51.833 --> 01:54.917
Besides, we don't
want cooperation.

01:56.292 --> 01:57.792
We want conversion.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.708
'We want repentance.'

02:00.792 --> 02:02.458
(male #1)
'The information
on the Resistance'

02:02.542 --> 02:04.458
we can pick up later.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.750
We have to stay focused
on the goal

02:06.833 --> 02:09.708
just to make him admit
that his campaign against Earth

02:09.792 --> 02:11.958
was the result
of alien influence.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.042
And to ask forgiveness.

02:16.125 --> 02:18.333
'If we're gonna put
an end to this war'

02:18.417 --> 02:20.917
we've got to break
the resistance in his heart.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.958
And the most efficient way
to do that is to break him.

02:26.250 --> 02:30.083
To break his mind,
his spirit and his body.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.667
It's only a matter of time,
effort and patience.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.208
Yeah.

02:41.958 --> 02:45.167
He's almost there.
This should help.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.708
More coffee?
It'll make you feel better.

02:49.042 --> 02:50.500
Love to.

02:54.417 --> 02:57.000
[instrumental music]

03:29.417 --> 03:30.875
It's about time.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.042
I was starting to get nervous.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.208
I was worried
you didn't get through.

03:34.292 --> 03:36.000
It took me a while
to make contact.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.583
The Resistance didn't stay alive
this long by being sloppy.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.208
Alright. So what'd they say?

03:40.292 --> 03:42.500
I had to do some
pretty fancy talking.

03:42.583 --> 03:43.875
They heard about
what you did to Sheridan.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.458
Did you tell them
it wasn't my fault?

03:45.542 --> 03:47.958
- I told them.
- And?

03:48.042 --> 03:50.000
They didn't believe me.

03:50.083 --> 03:51.500
No.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.083
[grunts]

03:54.167 --> 03:55.375
What?

04:02.083 --> 04:04.458
[theme music]

04:04.542 --> 04:06.625
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

04:06.708 --> 04:08.458
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

04:08.542 --> 04:11.542
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.292
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.583
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.167
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.833
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

04:18.917 --> 04:20.625
(Londo)
It was a new age.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.583
(Stephen)
It was the end of history.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.250
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.667
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.625
(Sheridan)
The place, Babylon 5.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.750
[theme music]

05:32.333 --> 05:34.958
[indistinct chatter]

05:36.667 --> 05:37.917
[grunts]

05:54.125 --> 05:57.042
Go on. It's your right.
It was your guy he set up.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.833
- I can't.
- 'Stephen?'

06:02.917 --> 06:04.458
[grunts]

06:05.792 --> 06:07.625
I wanna hear his side
of the story.

06:07.708 --> 06:09.583
What side? He set Sheridan up.

06:09.667 --> 06:12.750
We have 30 witnesses.
Now he wants to set us up too.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.292
I still wanna hear
his side of the story.

06:24.458 --> 06:27.292
- Thanks.
- No, don't thank me.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.417
Why did you do it?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.958
It was Bester.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.208
It was him all along. He..

06:36.292 --> 06:37.958
He altered me
when I was missing.

06:38.042 --> 06:39.125
He messed with my mind.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.500
He made me turn against
everybody I knew

06:40.583 --> 06:42.083
because he was
trying to find out

06:42.167 --> 06:44.458
who was behind a conspiracy
against the Psi-Corps.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.292
Yeah, and a dog
ate your homework.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.958
Get this over with.
We've got work to do, remember?

06:49.042 --> 06:50.292
Look, I-I-I--

06:50.375 --> 06:53.500
Sheridan promised he'd free Mars
when this was over.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.125
By turning him over,
this creep screwed us

06:55.208 --> 06:56.458
as much as he did you.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.458
So if you don't wanna
do it, let us.

06:59.542 --> 07:00.833
You got any proof?

07:00.917 --> 07:02.625
Anything to back up
this story of yours?

07:02.708 --> 07:04.583
- Anything?
- Yeah.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.500
I got a receipt from
the Psi-Corps certifying that

07:06.583 --> 07:08.792
my brain's been dry cleaned,
pressed and starched.

07:08.875 --> 07:10.917
Come on, Stephen. This is Bester
we're talking about here.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.125
Do you think he's gonna
leave any evidence?

07:14.042 --> 07:16.083
Damn it, it's true.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.208
Alright, look,
I got a pretty good idea

07:19.292 --> 07:20.750
where they're holding Sheridan.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.500
I think we can get him out,
but we gotta get to him

07:22.583 --> 07:23.875
before they ship him Earthside.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.167
You tried that line
with Sheridan

07:25.250 --> 07:26.542
and we saw where that ended.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.375
We're not falling for it
a second time.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.833
Once they get him off Mars,
we'll never get him out.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.542
Now come on.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.542
Stephen, we've worked together
for four years.

07:35.625 --> 07:36.917
That's gotta
count for something.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.750
Yeah, I thought so.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.917
But right now,
I don't know anymore.

07:43.292 --> 07:44.667
You can't do this to me.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.625
You can't let Bester
screw up my entire life

07:46.708 --> 07:49.292
and not give me
a chance to fix it.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.458
I-I can't go out this way.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.708
Ly-Lyta, Lyta, you can scan me.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.750
You-you can tell them
what I'm saying is the truth.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.375
I'm afraid they don't like
or trust telepaths around here.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.542
My word's not gonna
count for much.

08:10.625 --> 08:14.000
I agree, but I sure
would like to know.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.708
Wait a minute.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.750
So you're saying that
if this story of his is true

08:19.833 --> 08:22.250
she can verify it, so we'll know
it wasn't really his fault.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.500
- Is that it?
- That's it, yes.

08:24.583 --> 08:28.000
I have an obligation to him, the
same as you do to your people.

08:28.083 --> 08:31.750
Now what if it was one of yours?
What would you do then, huh?

08:31.833 --> 08:33.250
I mean, after all that's
happened, wouldn't you want

08:33.333 --> 08:35.292
to give him a chance
to prove himself?

08:37.708 --> 08:39.875
- No.
- No.

08:39.958 --> 08:41.083
(Lyta)
No!

08:41.167 --> 08:43.000
[gunfire]

08:44.667 --> 08:46.042
I mean it.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
You're making
a very big mistake.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.042
Yeah, well, it won't be
the first time, that's for sure.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.750
- Stephen.
- Shut up.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.917
This damn well
better be worth it

08:57.000 --> 08:58.625
because if this story of yours
turns out to be bogus

08:58.708 --> 09:01.250
I'm gonna kill you twice.
Now you got that?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.625
I got it.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.042
Can you still do it?

09:06.250 --> 09:08.125
Alright. Give me the rifle.

09:09.292 --> 09:10.958
Go ahead.

09:11.042 --> 09:13.000
Now he's gonna get his chance.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.750
Well?

09:20.208 --> 09:22.375
I can sense
you believe it's true.

09:23.792 --> 09:26.833
The core memory is closed.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.833
You've got blocks all over
the place. I can't get in.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.000
- It's all a jumble.
- Then push.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.333
Michael, if I do a deep scan,
it could damage you.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.958
And if you don't,
they're gonna kill me.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.750
Now a headache I can get over.

09:38.833 --> 09:41.542
I'm not sure I'm gonna get over
being dead any time soon.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.417
[instrumental music]

09:55.333 --> 09:58.167
Those are level 12 blocks.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.083
Only a Psi Cop can put them in

10:01.167 --> 10:03.417
or break them.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.000
You can do it.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.250
Come on, Lyta.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.292
I know you got it in you.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.833
Yes.

10:20.583 --> 10:23.125
[instrumental music]

10:41.333 --> 10:43.417
Michael, are you okay?

10:44.167 --> 10:46.667
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.250
I just realized I need
a lot more fiber in my diet.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.500
It's true.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.167
What he told us,
it's all, all true.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.792
Like that means a damn.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.708
How the hell do we know
what you saw?

10:58.792 --> 11:01.083
Why the hell should I believe
anything you have to..

11:03.083 --> 11:05.625
What do you know
about hell, hmm?

11:05.708 --> 11:08.167
Would you like me
to show it to you?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.125
Mine and his.

[dramatic music]

11:22.042 --> 11:23.292
It's true.

Damn.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.417
It's true.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.583
I saw it. How did--

11:31.667 --> 11:34.167
The truth speaks for itself.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.333
I'm just a messenger.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.125
Let him go.

11:56.292 --> 11:58.125
To the Damocles and the Orion

11:58.208 --> 11:59.958
you will surrender your vessels
and stand trial

12:00.042 --> 12:03.125
before a war crimes tribunal
on charges of murder.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.458
Failure to surrender will be met

and lethal response.

an evacuation order.

Estimate they can last..

12:56.917 --> 12:58.917
...another hour, maybe two.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Good. It's enough time
to get to the life pods.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.833

13:04.917 --> 13:06.500
Pick up any survivors
as they come out

13:06.583 --> 13:08.750
and deliver them to the proper
authorities on Beta 9.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.667
Susan, isn't this
slowing us down?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.542
Once we take care of Clark--

13:13.625 --> 13:14.875
His accomplices
will go to ground

13:14.958 --> 13:16.292
and we'll never find them.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.708
Look, we have to
make them understand

13:17.792 --> 13:19.500
that if they target
innocent people

13:19.583 --> 13:21.792
they can't run, they can't hide.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.333
I mean, President Clark
is issuing the orders

13:23.417 --> 13:24.875
but they're pulling the trigger.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.625
Besides every time
we engage the other side

13:26.708 --> 13:29.417
we get one or two
defectors to join up.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.958
When we get to Earth, we're
gonna need every ship we've got.

13:33.417 --> 13:34.917
Any word from Delenn yet?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.500
She'll join us
at the rendezvous point

13:36.583 --> 13:38.292
as soon as she can get away.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.833
Good.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.875
Put us on course
for the next target.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.917
(Garibaldi)
Well, I can't be positive

14:00.000 --> 14:01.583
but I'm pretty sure
the captain's being held

14:01.667 --> 14:04.708
in a staging area here
on Solis Planna.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.125
Based on what?

14:06.208 --> 14:08.083
I still got some contacts
from the old days.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.375
Besides, ISN has been
having a field day making me

14:10.458 --> 14:13.250
into the hero of the hour
since I turned him in.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.917
And since the local police
know that I set him up

14:15.000 --> 14:17.375
they're not too worried
about me knowing where he is.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.583
Okay, well, what's the plan?

14:20.667 --> 14:22.125
I don't have one.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.083
I mean, once we get inside,
I think I can get him out.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.083
It's getting inside
that's the problem.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.583
It's possible.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.167
We've cracked some
of their access tunnels.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.417
The ones they use to bring
in water, take out waste.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.583
They've also got
an independent air supply

14:33.667 --> 14:35.000
in case there's an attack
on the dome

14:35.083 --> 14:36.750
and air pressure's compromised.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.625
How fast can you
put together a team?

14:38.708 --> 14:40.958
That's the problem,
we're stretched thin these days

14:41.042 --> 14:43.500
and not all my people
know that area real well.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.958
The ones who do are on patrol.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.583
They won't be back
for another two days.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.125
Two days?

14:48.208 --> 14:50.375
But, well, the captain
has been in custody

14:50.458 --> 14:51.792
for almost a week.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.125
What if he can't
hold out that long?

14:53.208 --> 14:54.875
Then he'll be dead or broken.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.292
Which is why I can only afford
to give you a skeleton crew.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.000
Just enough to get you inside.
After that, you're on your own.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.083
- But you can't--
- Yes, I can.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.292
We're up to our eyes
in troops around here, Stephen

15:04.375 --> 15:06.958
and I'm not risking any more
on this than I have to.

15:07.042 --> 15:08.708
If you have a problem with that,
you can go somewhere else

15:08.792 --> 15:10.875
but that's my final offer.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.667
[intense music]

15:17.542 --> 15:19.917
[intense music]

15:26.792 --> 15:28.167
Delenn.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.208
Thank Valen, I found you
before you left.

15:30.292 --> 15:32.083
Ambassador Mollari
has convened a meeting

15:32.167 --> 15:33.708
of the League
of Non-Aligned Worlds

15:33.792 --> 15:35.083
and it's already started.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.083
What? Why wasn't I informed?

15:37.167 --> 15:38.667
I don't know,
but knowing the ambassador

15:38.750 --> 15:40.625
I'm already depressed
by the options.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.250
The situation
has become intolerable.

15:43.333 --> 15:47.667
We must take swift,
firm and decisive action.

15:47.750 --> 15:51.292
The Centauri will lead the way
as we have always done.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.625
'Toward that end,
we will mobilize'

15:53.708 --> 15:55.583
every ship at our disposal.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.958
Now I must call for a vote.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.458
A vote on what?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.167
Delenn, you shouldn't be here.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.000
The League cannot vote
without the presence

16:03.083 --> 16:04.667
of a representative
of Earth or Minbar.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.292
Well, in that case,
since you are here

16:07.375 --> 16:08.958
we can vote.

16:09.042 --> 16:10.625
All in favor?

16:12.208 --> 16:13.458
'Opposed?'

16:15.458 --> 16:17.500
There you are.

16:17.583 --> 16:19.417
It is done, Delenn.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.750
What is done?

16:20.833 --> 16:23.417
Sheridan has been captured
by his own people.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.292
We know that he is
being interrogated.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.375
Perhaps, even tortured.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.750
During the Shadow War

16:30.833 --> 16:33.583
Sheridan risked his life

16:33.667 --> 16:36.250
and the lives of every human
on this station

16:36.333 --> 16:39.167
to help save our worlds.

16:39.250 --> 16:42.458
Would the Gaim have done
that for the Pak'ma'ra?

16:43.833 --> 16:48.042
Would the Drazi have done
that for, for the Narn?

16:49.667 --> 16:51.000
'No.'

16:52.792 --> 16:55.333
That sacrifice must be rewarded.

16:55.417 --> 16:58.125
Since the war,
we have begun working together

16:58.208 --> 16:59.917
as never before.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.583
In the past, we had
nothing in common.

17:01.667 --> 17:05.917
But now the humans have become
the glue that holds us together.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.875
If Sheridan's forces
are defeated

17:07.958 --> 17:10.750
then Earth will turn in
upon itself.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.083
They will become isolated

17:12.167 --> 17:14.500
or they'll turn
against the rest of us.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.875
Politically, it is very wise.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.917
Morally, it is even wiser.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.917
Politics and morality
on the same side?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.125
That doesn't happen
every day, Delenn.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.167
If someone doesn't
begin making sense here

17:29.250 --> 17:31.292
I'm going to become
most annoyed.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.250
The League worlds have agreed

17:33.333 --> 17:35.792
to provide warships
to Ivanova's fleet.

17:35.875 --> 17:39.458
We will do whatever it takes
to help free Sheridan.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.125
It is right that
humans lead the battle.

17:41.208 --> 17:42.875
'It is their world, after all'

17:42.958 --> 17:44.375
but we can support them.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.167
Fight beside them
as they fought beside us.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.333
But why the secret ballot?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.375
Why were we not informed
about this meeting?

17:52.458 --> 17:53.792
To protect you.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.500
Some might accuse you of, of
organizing military support.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.792
Not because it is
the right thing to do

17:59.875 --> 18:02.458
but because of your relationship
with Sheridan.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.792
Others might say
the council approved it

18:04.875 --> 18:06.333
for the very same reason.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.333
We wanted to send a message

18:08.417 --> 18:11.667
that the council speaks as one
for the right reasons

18:11.750 --> 18:14.042
not out of any personal agenda.

18:14.125 --> 18:18.333
Sheridan is not alone
and you are not alone.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.208
The League stands with you.

18:20.292 --> 18:21.958
We all stand with you.

18:24.917 --> 18:27.458
[instrumental music]

18:42.667 --> 18:43.917
Alright, whoa.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.500
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

18:45.583 --> 18:47.958
Any time you wanna head back,
just say the word.

18:48.042 --> 18:50.125
I'll go with you.

18:50.208 --> 18:51.708
Okay.

18:51.792 --> 18:53.208
Every inch of the ground
above our heads

18:53.292 --> 18:55.292
is covered
by Earth military forces.

18:56.292 --> 18:57.708
They find you in this sector

18:57.792 --> 18:59.917
they don't even pretend
to question you.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.500
It's shoot on sight all the way.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.750
Why can't we ever
go anyplace nice?

19:04.833 --> 19:06.875
[rumbling]

19:08.167 --> 19:11.125
- What was that?
- Marsquake.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.542
(female #1)
'We've been getting them
in this area'

19:12.625 --> 19:14.417
'for the last couple of years.'

19:14.500 --> 19:17.458
Earth gov's been expanding
their underground facilities.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.708
Blasting to open up
more usable areas.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.417
Half the tunnels around here
have collapsed

19:22.500 --> 19:25.042
in the last couple of months.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.708
I'll go ahead,
check out the tunnel

19:26.792 --> 19:28.083
make sure it's clear.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.000
You wait here.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.292
This is gonna take forever.
Do you know that?

19:33.375 --> 19:35.333
Yeah, I know,
but it's the only way

19:35.417 --> 19:37.750
that we're gonna be able
to get inside the perimeter.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.958
I just hope the captain's still
alive by the time we get to him.

19:40.042 --> 19:42.167
They've been working him
over for more than a week.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.250
I wouldn't worry about that.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.583
They're not gonna kill him.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.833
They need him alive
as long as possible.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.208
Thanks.

19:50.292 --> 19:51.833
Alright, who gulped?
Somebody gulped.

19:51.917 --> 19:53.292
Look, we have got
a long way to go.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.375
We're supposed to sip, not gulp.

19:54.458 --> 19:55.542
- I didn't gulp.
- No?

19:55.625 --> 19:57.333
- I sipped.
- You, I believe.

19:57.417 --> 19:59.208
Well, now why do you
believe her and not me?

19:59.292 --> 20:00.875
Because when you lie,
it's all over your face.

20:00.958 --> 20:02.292
She's a much better liar
than you are.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.958
Thank you. Wait a minute--

20:04.042 --> 20:05.375
Look, the next time,
it's your turn to carry

20:05.458 --> 20:06.667
the canteen, I'm gonna gulp.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.250
You are so petty.
Do you know that?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.833
What do you mean
I'm a, I'm a good liar?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.125
- Survival of the fittest.
- Oh, here she comes.

20:13.583 --> 20:16.750
- The way's clear. Let's go.
- Okay.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.125
But I-I don't like
what I'm hearing here.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.667
I'm not a great liar.
I'm a, I'm a terrible liar.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.417
You know, I don't know
who's been saying these things

20:24.500 --> 20:26.083
but I want you to know
when we get back

20:26.167 --> 20:27.542
I am gonna sue somebody.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.375
I don't know who
and I don't know how

20:29.458 --> 20:32.792
but, by God, I am
gonna sue somebody.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.833
(Garibaldi)
'Would you come on already?'

20:34.917 --> 20:36.625
[grunts]

20:36.708 --> 20:39.292
[instrumental music]

20:48.417 --> 20:50.083
Hold this.

20:55.958 --> 20:57.333
Hold on.

20:57.417 --> 20:59.083
This is as far
as I can take you.

20:59.167 --> 21:01.667
This tunnel runs under
the main staging area.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.458
From here on out,
you're on your own.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.542
- Now wait a minute--
- I can't risk it.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.625
Not even for Sheridan.

21:07.708 --> 21:10.708
They've got patrols that sweep
the area every couple of hours.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.750
And try not to fire any PPGs.

21:12.833 --> 21:16.000
The heat sensors will
pick up any weapons fired.

21:16.083 --> 21:18.458
I'll wait for you back
at the first big tunnel.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.750
[music continues]

21:39.667 --> 21:41.667
I thought you might
wanna hear this.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.375
He was in one of the life pods
picked up by the Agamemnon.

21:44.458 --> 21:45.750
You were aboard the Damocles?

21:45.833 --> 21:47.708
Duty Officer David Eisensen.

21:47.792 --> 21:49.208
I want you to know
that a lot of us opposed

21:49.292 --> 21:50.875
the captain's order
to attack Beta 9.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.708
Tell that to the men, women
and children that you killed.

21:52.792 --> 21:53.958
It wasn't my fault.

21:54.042 --> 21:55.333
The extent of your guilt
will be determined

21:55.417 --> 21:56.875
by the war crimes tribunal.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.750
- It has nothing to do with me.
- What if I had information?

21:59.833 --> 22:01.417
Would that make a difference
with the tribunal?

22:01.500 --> 22:04.542
Depends what kind
of information.

22:04.625 --> 22:07.375
President Clark knows
you're heading to Mars next.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.042
'He knows you're gonna
rendezvous with the rest'

22:09.125 --> 22:11.958
'of your ships in Sector 300
and go in from there.'

22:12.042 --> 22:13.542
How?

22:13.625 --> 22:17.083
Not everyone who defects
to your side really defects.

22:17.167 --> 22:19.750
'Some of them are playing
both sides against the middle.'

22:19.833 --> 22:22.417
They're gonna lay a trap
for this fleet of yours.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.875
I know some of the details

22:24.958 --> 22:26.708
enough to think that
you should be very worried.

22:26.792 --> 22:27.875
Why?

22:27.958 --> 22:29.167
'The ships being sent
to ambush you'

22:29.250 --> 22:30.417
aren't Earthforce regulars.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.750
These are advanced
model destroyers.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.208
Part of an elite force
Clark has put together.

22:34.292 --> 22:36.667
They're loyal to the new order.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.625
They won't defect.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.292
And they won't give up.

22:42.333 --> 22:46.083
- How many ships?
- I don't know.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.917
A lot.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.667
- This isn't good.
- Definitely.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.625
We could try going around them.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.292
Well, that would save us,
but what about the rest

23:03.375 --> 23:05.167
of the ships that are
supposed to meet us there?

23:05.250 --> 23:06.792
I mean, even if we try
and change the rendezvous

23:06.875 --> 23:09.458
we can't get through
to them in time.

23:09.542 --> 23:12.125
You know, Clark wouldn't risk
exposing his advanced destroyers

23:12.208 --> 23:14.417
like this unless he was
pretty sure of them.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.792
If they're a new design,
he'll probably use them

23:16.875 --> 23:19.875
against the other
Earth destroyers first.

23:19.958 --> 23:22.542
Combined with the fact that
the enemy almost certainly knows

23:22.625 --> 23:25.333
their weak spots,
they'd be wiped out.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.833
Which could be his intention.

23:27.917 --> 23:30.000
If he gets rid of the rest
of the Earth ships

23:30.083 --> 23:32.458
and weakens our forces, he could
convince the folks back home

23:32.542 --> 23:35.833
that it's just aliens
making trouble.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.250
I won't let our forces get
caught in an ambush, Marcus

23:38.333 --> 23:40.167
no matter what.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.625
Can we handle them?

23:41.708 --> 23:44.333
Hard to say without knowing
their capabilities.

23:44.417 --> 23:47.167
But we have a better chance
than anybody else.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.167
That's enough for me.

23:59.958 --> 24:02.292
- 'You check in here?'
- 'That corner's been cleared.'

24:02.375 --> 24:04.333
(male #2)
'Let's move ahead.'

24:15.458 --> 24:17.458
[grunts]

24:19.458 --> 24:20.917
[grunts]

24:22.792 --> 24:24.542
- Are you alright?
- You alright?

24:24.625 --> 24:27.750
[groans]
Oh, I don't think so.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.542
[groaning]

24:36.625 --> 24:38.625
I still think
you should stay here.

24:39.875 --> 24:42.208
Not a chance.

24:42.292 --> 24:44.958
You lost a lot of blood
and if there's any more fighting

24:45.042 --> 24:47.708
I can't guarantee that
these sutures are gonna hold.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.250
Well, then you're just gonna
have to give me my money back.

24:52.292 --> 24:54.625
You didn't pay me any money.

24:54.708 --> 24:57.042
That's just my luck, isn't it?

24:57.125 --> 24:59.792
Hey, you hid the bodies?

24:59.875 --> 25:01.625
Yeah.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.333
Alright, a couple more seconds,
we'll be done.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.792
- Alright.
- Okay.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.042
- Yeah?
- All done.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.125
Ah, good. Thank you.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.375
Alright.

25:13.375 --> 25:15.208
Let's get going, huh?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.208
Oh.

25:21.625 --> 25:24.000
(Captain James)
Commander, I have to say
I disagree with this.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.750
(Ivanova)
I thought you might.
Nonetheless, I insist.

25:26.833 --> 25:29.500
We know that Clark has set up
an ambush for us in Sector 300.

25:29.583 --> 25:30.917
The White Stars
can get there faster

25:31.000 --> 25:32.542
than anything else we've got.

25:32.625 --> 25:34.917
If our information is right and
those are advanced destroyers

25:35.000 --> 25:37.500
waiting for us, we're the best
suited to take care of them.

25:37.583 --> 25:39.667
All the more reason
for us to go with you.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.708
I don't want to endanger
the rest of the fleet.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.125
Especially the other
Earth destroyers.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.792
Y-you're an important symbol.

25:44.875 --> 25:48.208
Proof that it's not just us and
a few other alien troublemakers.

25:48.292 --> 25:51.208
Look, captain,
until Delenn gets here

25:51.292 --> 25:52.792
Captain Sheridan
left the White Star fleet

25:52.875 --> 25:54.250
under my authority.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.292
I have to do what's right.

25:56.375 --> 25:59.250
Alright. If there's no way
to convince you.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.708
There isn't.
Just stay ready.

26:01.792 --> 26:05.167
If we should fall, we need you
to clean up what's left.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.625
Will do.
Good luck, commander.

26:07.708 --> 26:09.042
We'll see you on the flip side.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.792
Count on it.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.583
[dramatic music]

26:14.375 --> 26:17.333
Now that we're en route,
I suggest you get some sleep.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.125
You've been up for almost
20 hours straight.

26:21.208 --> 26:24.500
Even at top speed, we won't be
there for another five hours.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.208
At least you could get
in a catnap.

26:27.292 --> 26:29.458
We're about to go into battle
against an enemy force

26:29.542 --> 26:32.667
whose numbers and capabilities
we don't know.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.667
- Could you sleep?
- No.

26:35.583 --> 26:37.708
But you could rest.

26:37.792 --> 26:39.292
Well, let me put it
to you this way.

26:39.375 --> 26:42.333
You can either get four hours
and 59 minutes rest

26:42.417 --> 26:46.333
or four hours and 59 minutes
of me bothering you about it.

26:46.417 --> 26:49.625
- Uh, you wouldn't.
- Rangers never bluff.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.208
[sighs]

26:52.292 --> 26:54.000
Alright, I'll take two
and a half hours

26:54.083 --> 26:55.583
if you take two
and a half hours.

26:55.667 --> 26:57.833
Done. You go first.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.875
- Hey there.
- Yes, sir.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.583
- We need to see the prisoner.
- Which prison..

27:30.667 --> 27:33.042
Hey, I know you.
I saw you on ISN.

27:33.125 --> 27:34.875
You're the one
that turned in Sheridan.

27:34.958 --> 27:37.500
- The one and only.
- Yeah. Good work.

27:37.583 --> 27:39.208
So what's up?

27:39.292 --> 27:40.875
Well, we need to check
on his condition.

27:40.958 --> 27:42.917
Uh, this is Dr. Stephens

27:43.000 --> 27:45.375
and his assistant,
Miss Alexander.

27:45.458 --> 27:47.375
I didn't get anything
about this.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.208
They, uh, they want deniability.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.417
Now like I said, we're here
to check on his condition.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.042
But what we're really
supposed to do is

27:53.125 --> 27:54.250
give him a little walk
around the block

27:54.333 --> 27:55.583
if you get my meaning.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.375
Yeah, and if he falls down
a few times--

27:57.458 --> 28:00.667
Then we need a doc to make sure
he doesn't fall too hard.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.750
Got it.

28:02.833 --> 28:05.875
From anybody but you, well..

28:05.958 --> 28:08.625
Okay. Go on in, but you'll have
to check with the cell guards.

28:08.708 --> 28:10.750
'They have final authority
over visitors.'

28:10.833 --> 28:12.500
Thank you.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.250
Good afternoon.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.583
We understand you got
Sheridan in there.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.833
I'm the one who turned him in.
Maybe you saw me on ISN.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.500
I don't watch TV.

28:31.583 --> 28:33.792
It's a cultural wasteland filled
with inappropriate metaphors

28:33.875 --> 28:35.333
and an unrealistic portrayal
of life

28:35.417 --> 28:37.208
created by the liberal
media elite.

28:37.292 --> 28:38.708
I couldn't agree more.
Dr. Stephens?

28:38.792 --> 28:40.083
- Absolutely.
- 'Good.'

28:40.167 --> 28:41.292
(Garibaldi)
'Now that we've established'

28:41.375 --> 28:42.292
some common ground

28:42.375 --> 28:44.083
we'd like to see the prisoner.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.583
I'm gonna have to ask
for your authorization.

28:46.667 --> 28:48.125
Of course.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.125
Then once we get the codes,
we're in, right?

28:50.208 --> 28:51.875
'Dr., uh, Stephens?'

28:52.958 --> 28:55.250
Uh, yeah, I've, uh..

28:56.375 --> 28:58.792
It's here somewhere.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.042
[softly]
Pain.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.375
[groans]

29:05.250 --> 29:06.333
Did you get the code?

29:06.417 --> 29:07.958
He thought it as soon
as you said it.

29:08.042 --> 29:12.083
7-12-54-50-19.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.708
- Here.
- Here you go.

29:14.792 --> 29:16.167
Captain.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.792
Captain, can you hear me?
Captain.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.125
Michael.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.500
'Why, I was gonna
kick your butt'

29:24.583 --> 29:27.250
for something that I..

29:27.333 --> 29:29.708
...I don't remember.

29:29.792 --> 29:32.042
- Drugged up pretty bad.
- No kidding.

29:32.125 --> 29:33.708
Look, we need him
ready to travel.

29:33.792 --> 29:36.542
- I'll do my best.
- Just do better, alright?

29:36.625 --> 29:38.250
[groans]

29:40.500 --> 29:43.042
[intense music]

29:59.833 --> 30:01.750
You'll never know.

30:03.750 --> 30:05.208
You slept well.

30:05.292 --> 30:07.292
'Last time you couldn't sleep
at all in these things.'

30:07.375 --> 30:09.375
Oh, I still hate them.

30:09.458 --> 30:11.625
- How long did I sleep?
- Four hours.

30:11.708 --> 30:13.083
Four hours.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.750
We're still 45 minutes
from the target.

30:14.833 --> 30:16.875
More than enough time
to wake up.

30:16.958 --> 30:18.375
You needed the rest.

30:18.458 --> 30:20.125
That's the last time
I'll ever trust you.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.708
Also the first.

30:21.792 --> 30:23.375
Hey.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.625
The last time
that we were in this room

30:25.708 --> 30:27.375
you said something to me
in Minbari.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.458
I happen to have
an eidetic memory.

30:29.542 --> 30:31.333
It went, uh..

30:31.417 --> 30:33.458
[speaking Minbari]

30:35.625 --> 30:38.042
You told me
it was just a greeting.

30:38.125 --> 30:39.250
Yes.

30:39.333 --> 30:40.750
Well, in case
you haven't noticed

30:40.833 --> 30:43.458
I've, uh, learned
a little Minbari since then.

30:45.583 --> 30:47.125
Thank you.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.125
[speaking Minbari]

30:55.458 --> 30:57.083
Hey, good news.

30:57.167 --> 30:58.417
He's decided to give
a full confession.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.583
I figure we'll just
take him on in--

30:59.667 --> 31:00.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:00.792 --> 31:01.958
'You're not taking him anywhere'

31:02.042 --> 31:03.625
without the proper
authorization.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.208
'How'd you get him out of there,
anyway? You're not--'

31:05.292 --> 31:07.500
Look, there's no
problem, alright?

31:07.583 --> 31:09.667
What's wrong with your back?

31:11.667 --> 31:14.458
- Nothing.
- Step away from the prisoner.

31:14.542 --> 31:16.417
[gunfire]

31:19.250 --> 31:21.417
(Garibaldi)
'Alright, come on. Let's move.'

31:26.667 --> 31:27.917
Whoo!

31:28.000 --> 31:29.500
(Lyta)
'You alright, captain?'

31:29.583 --> 31:31.875
I'm fine. Just fine.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.750
(Ivanova)
'Where's the rendezvous point?'

31:36.833 --> 31:38.250
Are you picking up
any transmissions?

31:38.333 --> 31:41.083
Negative.
Shall we go in?

31:47.875 --> 31:49.792
Anything on the scanners?

31:49.875 --> 31:52.292
Nothing.
Maybe the information was wrong.

31:52.375 --> 31:53.875
No, we're not that lucky.
Check the--

31:53.958 --> 31:57.083
W-wait a minute.
I'm getting something.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.625
Is that what I think it is?

32:11.792 --> 32:14.750
Confirmed. Scanners indicate
that the destroyers

32:14.833 --> 32:17.458
are using a semi-organic
hull design.

32:17.542 --> 32:20.208
- Shadow technology.
- Exactly.

32:20.292 --> 32:22.042
We knew they'd got their hands
on a Shadow vessel

32:22.125 --> 32:23.458
but who'd have thought
they could've adapted

32:23.542 --> 32:25.875
the technology this quickly?

32:25.958 --> 32:27.500
(Thompson on computer)
'This is Captain J. Thompson'

32:27.583 --> 32:30.167
'of the advanced destroyer
group to enemy vessels.'

32:30.250 --> 32:31.833
'We have you surrounded.'

32:31.917 --> 32:35.208
'You are ordered to surrender
your vessels or be destroyed.'

32:35.292 --> 32:38.333
'I say again,
surrender or be destroyed.'

32:40.250 --> 32:42.042
Put me on with him.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.042
And give me firing control.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.542
This is the White Star fleet.

32:48.625 --> 32:51.250
Negative on surrender.

32:51.333 --> 32:54.042
We will not stand down.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.333
(Thompson)
'Who is this?
Identify yourself.'

32:57.792 --> 32:59.417
Who am I?

33:00.792 --> 33:02.875
I am Susan Ivanova.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.583
Commander.

33:04.667 --> 33:08.458
Daughter of Andrei
and Sophie Ivanov.

33:08.542 --> 33:11.833
I am the right hand
of vengeance

33:11.917 --> 33:13.958
and the boot that is gonna
kick your sorry ass

33:14.042 --> 33:16.208
all the way back
to Earth, sweetheart.

33:17.625 --> 33:20.375
I am death incarnate.

33:20.458 --> 33:24.750
And the last living thing
that you are ever going to see.

33:27.458 --> 33:29.500
God sent me.

33:31.042 --> 33:34.083
[gunfire]

33:36.042 --> 33:38.583
[dramatic music]

33:46.000 --> 33:47.792
They're launching fighters.

33:57.208 --> 33:58.458
Tell the others to form up.

33:58.542 --> 34:00.292
I need a flying wedge
and cover from the fighters.

34:00.375 --> 34:01.625
We're faster
and more maneuverable

34:01.708 --> 34:03.833
than the destroyers.
Let's take advantage of it.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.208
Forming up.

34:06.708 --> 34:09.750
[gunfire]

34:15.000 --> 34:16.417
Go.

34:16.500 --> 34:18.500
[gunfire]

34:32.750 --> 34:35.333
[music continues]

34:42.875 --> 34:45.333
Enemy ships closing in,
trying to surround us.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.167
Stand by for high velocity bank.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.417
Break and come around
on my mark.

34:52.333 --> 34:55.833
Stand by...stand by.

34:55.917 --> 34:57.333
Break!

35:01.833 --> 35:03.083
[explosion]

35:05.750 --> 35:07.958
[gunfire]

35:12.542 --> 35:14.208
- Keep firing.
- 'Collision in 30 seconds.'

35:14.292 --> 35:15.833
- Keep firing!
- Susan.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.917
If we let it get away, they'll
bring back reinforcements.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.458
Stay on course.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.333
[gunfire]

35:25.583 --> 35:27.250
[explosion]

35:40.208 --> 35:42.583
Navigational control damage!
Working to repair.

35:42.667 --> 35:44.167
- How many left?
- Just one.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.375
White Stars 4 and 9
are on it.

35:46.458 --> 35:47.708
Susan!

35:53.208 --> 35:54.417
[explosion]

35:54.500 --> 35:56.375
[electrical crackling]

35:56.458 --> 35:59.000
[machines beeping]

36:04.542 --> 36:05.667
Susan.

36:05.750 --> 36:07.542
[woman coughs]

36:07.625 --> 36:09.125
[man groans]

36:14.833 --> 36:17.375
[intense music]

36:41.500 --> 36:43.333
[explosion]

36:47.000 --> 36:49.083
[instrumental music]

37:06.375 --> 37:07.833
John.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.458
[sighs]

37:21.750 --> 37:24.792
Oh, I saw you standing..

37:24.875 --> 37:27.792
...so many times,
just like that.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.542
I-I've told my personal
physicians to look at you.

37:30.625 --> 37:33.375
No. It-it can wait.

37:33.458 --> 37:34.917
I wanna see her.

37:36.208 --> 37:39.667
- Are you sure you're--
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.833
It wasn't that bad.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.958
Well, look, I-I'll..

37:47.583 --> 37:49.542
I'll talk about it
when I'm ready.

37:49.625 --> 37:51.958
It's just gonna take a while.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.667
Alright?

37:59.917 --> 38:02.000
I'll take you to her.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.083
[instrumental music]

38:26.542 --> 38:28.750
I got the bed just how
she likes it.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.333
Nice and flat.

38:31.417 --> 38:33.792
They didn't want to.

38:33.875 --> 38:35.958
They thought it was bad luck.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.000
Didn't know what else to do.

38:43.375 --> 38:46.125
- Can I..
- If she will hear you.

38:47.083 --> 38:49.208
She's been fading in and out

38:49.292 --> 38:51.375
since we brought her aboard.

39:03.167 --> 39:05.042
Hi.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.750
Hi.

39:08.417 --> 39:10.500
How are you feeling?

39:12.333 --> 39:14.375
Not so good, John.

39:16.292 --> 39:17.958
'Not so good.'

39:21.417 --> 39:24.875
We, we got them.
Did they tell you?

39:24.958 --> 39:26.625
They told me.

39:27.917 --> 39:29.792
'There were..'

39:29.875 --> 39:32.417
...more of them than us

39:32.500 --> 39:34.792
and they fought like hell.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.125
But we got them.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.458
Didn't we, Marcus?

39:42.417 --> 39:43.875
We got them.

39:47.292 --> 39:49.875
We cleared the way
for you, John.

39:51.417 --> 39:53.500
All the way to Mars.

39:56.292 --> 39:58.167
No ambushes.

39:58.833 --> 40:00.083
No..

40:04.125 --> 40:06.625
We should go.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.042
Marcus will stay with her.

40:10.417 --> 40:12.167
Alright.

40:12.250 --> 40:13.667
John?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.250
I'm here. What?

40:20.833 --> 40:22.500
They won't..

40:23.875 --> 40:25.167
...tell me..

40:26.375 --> 40:28.417
...the truth.

40:31.417 --> 40:33.500
You're my friend, John.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.875
Tell me..

40:37.958 --> 40:39.833
...the truth.

40:44.917 --> 40:47.625
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

40:49.708 --> 40:52.250
[mellow music]

41:02.417 --> 41:04.042
No.

41:05.625 --> 41:08.583
'No, they say the damage is..'

41:12.125 --> 41:14.042
I'm sorry, Susan.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.208
It's okay.

41:22.125 --> 41:24.000
Don't be.

41:25.958 --> 41:27.375
You've..

41:27.458 --> 41:31.125
You've carried so much
guilt around in your life.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.042
'Don't carry..'

41:35.958 --> 41:38.375
'...any more for me.'

41:40.958 --> 41:43.250
Or I'm gonna..

41:43.333 --> 41:45.083
...come back and kick your ass.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.708
How long?

41:55.250 --> 41:57.208
Our doctors say..

41:57.292 --> 41:59.875
...they can promise
only a few days.

41:59.958 --> 42:01.833
Maybe a week.

42:03.667 --> 42:05.292
You see?

42:06.958 --> 42:08.833
It's not so bad.

42:14.292 --> 42:15.917
John.

42:17.250 --> 42:19.333
Do something for me?

42:21.167 --> 42:22.625
Anything.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.125
What is it?

42:26.750 --> 42:28.625
It's not what.

42:30.333 --> 42:32.167
Where.

42:38.958 --> 42:40.625
Captain on deck.

42:49.375 --> 42:52.208
With the permission
of Captain James..

42:54.042 --> 42:56.958
...I'm assuming the command
of the Agamemnon.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.792
A friend..

42:59.875 --> 43:02.958
...asked me to command
the last battle from here.

43:04.625 --> 43:07.250
[instrumental music]

43:09.750 --> 43:11.458
Put us on course..

43:12.583 --> 43:13.667
...for Mars.

43:13.750 --> 43:15.083
(male #3)
'Aye aye, sir.'

43:15.167 --> 43:18.542
'Set for Mars.
Peak at M9915 Alpha.'
