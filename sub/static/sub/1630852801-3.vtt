WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.481
- Previously,
on the Kings of Napa.

00:03.525 --> 00:06.354
- I know this recent revelation
about Dad has been rough.
- And remember,

00:06.397 --> 00:10.488
the House of Kings
is about Black excellence
and infidelity.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.491
- What were you thinking,
Melanie? You were supposed
to take that to your grave.

00:13.535 --> 00:17.017
- She hasn't called you,
has she?
- I'm here for you and only you.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.193
- Wake up, Christian!
You got big shoes to fill!

00:19.236 --> 00:22.718
- If I bring you back,
Dana will have
all the ammunition he needs.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.589
This is my legacy now!

00:24.633 --> 00:27.027
- It's mine too!
- This new wine
could revolutionize us.

00:27.070 --> 00:31.031
We must continue to show
the world that we are Kings.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.262
Listen, Bridgette.
I know you're mad at me.

00:45.306 --> 00:48.091
I've only left you, like,
I don't know, 100 messages.

00:48.135 --> 00:52.139
I just... We're family.
We are supposed to make wine
together.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.837
I just need some time
to make it all right.
Please call me back.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.405
Grace!
[chuckling]

00:57.448 --> 00:59.494
- Oh, this place.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.062
Always been magical.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.499
- Well, you know we missed you.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.196
- Thank you for calling
about my ring.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.980
I couldn't remember
where I lost it.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.982
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

01:10.026 --> 01:14.726
- I have a little favour
to ask of you first.
- The answer's no.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.425
Making wine leaves a void
in my soul.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.992
- But Grace, wine is your soul.

01:20.036 --> 01:25.781
- Was. I don't have the energy
to fight the naysayers anymore.

01:25.824 --> 01:30.133
- Okay, well, do you have the
energy to make one last farewell
blend for my dad?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.701
For me, for House of Kings?

01:32.744 --> 01:35.225
- I hope you weren't lying
about finding my ring.

01:35.269 --> 01:38.141
- Okay, I don't have it, but...

01:38.185 --> 01:42.145
I did find this duplicate.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.583
- That's fool's gold,
and so is this endeavour.
No, thank you.

01:45.627 --> 01:49.544
- Listen. Listen, Grace.
We're in trouble.

01:49.587 --> 01:53.374
I stand to lose everything
my father ever worked for.

01:53.417 --> 01:58.205
The only way to save this place
is to make a dessert wine unlike
anything else on the planet,

01:58.248 --> 02:01.904
win some awards and make it hard
to keep on the shelves.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.167
And I only have six months.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.169
- I'm sorry,
but I can't help you.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.303
- Okay. Is this what one bad
Wine Spectator review can do

02:09.346 --> 02:11.740
to one of the best winemakers
in the past decade?

02:11.783 --> 02:15.047
Remember that brilliant blend
you made for the Obamas?

02:15.091 --> 02:17.137
Yeah, they just ordered another
case for Michelle's birthday.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.313
- Queen Michelle?
- Yes, girl!

02:19.356 --> 02:23.447
It is time to boss up
like the wine queen you are.

02:23.491 --> 02:26.711
The setback is nothing
like the comeback. Trust.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.496
Can't you smell the grapes?

02:28.539 --> 02:31.499
- Don't.
- Taste them on your tongue?
- Don't do this.

02:31.542 --> 02:35.938
- You old workspace is saged
and filled with crystals.

02:35.981 --> 02:38.245
I even ordered those African
violets you like,

02:38.288 --> 02:41.596
and we can go back to having
our lunchtime dance parties.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.251
Come on! What do you say?

02:48.733 --> 02:51.258
[theme music]

03:29.296 --> 03:31.863
These are the Grenache grapes
we'll be using.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.561
Consider them yours.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.435
We cannot tell you how special
it is to have you back here
with us again.

03:38.479 --> 03:42.265
- Absolutely. This project is my
sister's brainchild, her baby.

03:42.309 --> 03:47.009
And as her brother and ally,
I'll do whatever she needs.

03:47.052 --> 03:50.752
- Well, in order
for these grapes to be ready
for production in four months,

03:50.795 --> 03:54.582
there must be a second phase of
leaf stripping on the clusters.

03:54.625 --> 03:58.020
- Okay.
- I texted you a list
of the items that I'll need.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.022
[phone beeping]

04:02.067 --> 04:05.462
- You must be out your goddamn--
- Anything you need, Grace.

04:08.726 --> 04:12.077
- We can't afford a boujee wine
aficionado and an extortionist.

04:12.121 --> 04:15.298
- We can't put a price tag
on protecting my vision
for this place.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
Both are important right now.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.302
What's the ETA
on your PI friend?

04:19.346 --> 04:22.523
- He'll be here later.
Until then,
keep your wallet shut.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.528
- Alright, Ma. I see you
in your bounce-back swag.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.356
You look beautiful.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.445
- Thank you.
- Mm.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.495
Taking it to the head, huh?
Are you sure you're cool?

04:38.539 --> 04:42.369
- Y-yes. Why wouldn't I be?
- I thought you'd be going
"All About Eve,"

04:42.412 --> 04:45.763
cutting Aunt Melanie outta
all the family photos by now.
[laughing]

04:45.807 --> 04:50.072
- No.
Because of that little pen-pal
situation she and your dad had?

04:50.115 --> 04:53.336
Never mind. Your father and I,
we were on a whole different
level.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.208
Besides,
I can't just fall to pieces.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.647
This place is what it is
because I am who I am.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.084
- True.
- It's my special touch.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.260
- I hear that.
- Yes.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.829
- And you know I'm about to be
the GOAT of vineyard managers,
right?

05:07.872 --> 05:11.049
- Listen to me. For a brother
who got off to a rocky start,
just pace yourself.

05:11.093 --> 05:16.228
- Don't listen to the haters.
- It's just you're my baby and
I know how stressed you can get.

05:16.272 --> 05:19.667
- If you can get over
what Auntie Melanie and Dad did,
I can handle this.

05:19.710 --> 05:23.366
Trust, the bipolar is real,
but I'm working on keepin' it
together.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.716
This is too important
to our family.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.980
I need to be clear and present
so August and Dana
don't gotta do all the work.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.070
I'm gonna show people that
the King blood runs in me too.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.768
- My incredible baby boy.

05:33.811 --> 05:38.686
I love you and I'm in that ring
fighting with you.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.776
Trust.
- Trust?
[chuckling]

05:41.819 --> 05:43.647
- Isn't that how you all say it?
Trust.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.823
- You gotta put a little
more swag on it. Trust.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.043
- Trust. Trust.
- Trust. There you go.
- Trust.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.700
- We've got a lot going on,
so we appreciate the help,
Quincy.

05:52.743 --> 05:56.486
- We need to find out
who's shaking down my father.
- Extortion is my specialty,

05:56.530 --> 06:01.012
along with breeding
Pembroke Welsh Corgis and
reading anything by Hilton Als.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.712
- Let's just make sure
whatever's discussed
in this room stays in this room.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.062
- We're gonna tell everyone
you're our new head of security.

06:07.105 --> 06:10.370
- Keeping this on the low-low
is gonna cost
an extra grand-grand.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.154
[buzzing]
[sighing]

06:12.937 --> 06:15.810
- Grace needs another five Gs
to blend a sample port. So?

06:15.853 --> 06:18.073
- She's gonna suck us dry.
- Relax.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.945
- Listen, we can't afford
to pay you an extra thousand

06:20.989 --> 06:23.731
because we have other
extortionists on the list
ahead of you.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.821
- I'll tell you what.
Since you're my frat brother,
I'll hook you up

06:26.864 --> 06:30.477
with the red-and-white special,
but I want to be very clear
on something.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.350
- What's that, bro?
- People who extort
usually kill.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.702
Y'all better buck up, 'cause
things are about to get bloody.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.183
[sniffing]
I can smell it.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.926
[smooth R&B]

06:50.801 --> 06:53.543
- Damn, girl, you gotta close
your eyes if you want to have
some epiphanies.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.980
- Ugh. My plate is full
of epiphanies right now.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.113
I keep trying to patch
things up, but you know
how Bridgette is.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.768
- Oh, I know how you are:
blinded by the truth at times.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.248
[scoffing]
- Way to have my back.

07:03.292 --> 07:06.077
- If you wanted an echo chamber,
you called the wrong friend
over, boo.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.210
After all, you fired Bridgette.

07:08.253 --> 07:11.300
- Hey there.
- Kelvin!
- Hi.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.868
I'm Maddi. Dr. Maddi Brewer.

07:13.911 --> 07:17.480
Ahem. I'm a bit thirsty.
I'm gonna go
and get some lemonade.

07:19.003 --> 07:22.442
Girl, no wonder
you're hallucinating
about high-school homecoming.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.357
He is fine as hell. Now go.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.055
- Okay, okay.

07:29.797 --> 07:33.104
I wish I knew you were coming.
I would've had Marcie
make you some lunch.

07:33.148 --> 07:35.629
- Oh, it's all good, I just came
to talk about a few things.

07:35.672 --> 07:40.155
- Everything okay?
- August, we negotiated
and agreed on the terms

07:40.198 --> 07:42.549
to accept a monthly payment
from your Aunt Melanie.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.986
And then you switched it up
before the ink was dry.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.249
You made me look
like a bad lawyer to my client.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.033
- I didn't mean to put you
in an awkward position,

07:49.077 --> 07:52.384
but it was that or have my mom
picked up on a 5150.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.517
- She's really having
a hard time?
- Yes.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.955
And the last thing I would ever
wanna do is leave you hanging.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.870
I'm sorry. I should've called.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.048
Can I make it up to you
over drinks?

08:04.092 --> 08:05.920
Martinis? Lots of olives?

08:05.963 --> 08:08.357
- An olive branch.
- Without the branch.

08:08.879 --> 08:12.404
- Ah, so a date?
- You asking me, or telling me?

08:12.448 --> 08:16.539
- Both. But... we've gotta
promise each other something.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.456
If we're gonna open this door
back up, we gotta be honest
with each other.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.197
- I can do that.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.853
- So... how's Friday night?

08:25.896 --> 08:27.811
- Mm.
- Hmm?

08:27.855 --> 08:29.552
- Friday could work.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.339
[chuckling]

08:34.383 --> 08:35.906
Okay.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.736
[birdsong]

08:53.097 --> 08:55.796
- What the hell was going on
between you and my sister?

08:55.839 --> 08:58.102
Tsk. Dammit.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.934
Why can't I remember
the password? Why?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.415
Christian! August!

09:14.031 --> 09:15.380
Jesus.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.517
[funky music]

09:23.301 --> 09:25.303
- I hope you taste like vinegar.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.176
- Trouble in King paradise?
- Ugh!

09:28.219 --> 09:31.309
I haven't worked
at that hellhole
in at least a month now.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.530
Do you ever wonder what it was
like back then, Groesbeck,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.532
when your grandfather took care
of the vines?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.839
I bet the soil was richer
and the grapes were sweeter.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.276
- By the taste of your wine,
you guys are doing okay.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.887
Don't look. Here comes one
of the royals now.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.412
- Bridgette!
It's so good to see you.
- Oh...

09:48.588 --> 09:51.591
- How've you been?
- Ugh.
Trying to find my footing.

09:52.243 --> 09:54.681
Finding out you have a sister,
brothers,

09:54.724 --> 09:56.770
and losing your job
in the same day

09:56.813 --> 09:59.555
just kind of throws you
off your balance.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.123
- Honey, you and August
will be thick as thieves again
in no time.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.648
And you know Vanessa.
She's like a jigsaw puzzle.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.695
Could break into pieces
or be framed at any time.

10:08.738 --> 10:12.133
- Vanessa I get,
but August I can't believe.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.831
She and I were gonna develop
a specialty wine together,

10:14.875 --> 10:17.138
expand the vineyard to Italy.

10:17.181 --> 10:20.402
I even have a rare hybrid grape
growing in the back

10:20.445 --> 10:24.232
that I was gonna surprise her
with and name after us. No.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.147
- I'm so sorry
you're going through this.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.410
But how's the job search going?

10:28.453 --> 10:30.107
- I've got an interview
at Sean & Shawn.

10:30.151 --> 10:33.197
- Didn't the one who drinks
three bottles a day say

10:33.241 --> 10:35.591
our Merlot tasted
like Two Buck Chuck?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.375
- Maybe I should just cancel.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.074
I'm not looking to make a bigger
wedge between me and August.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.163
- No. You keep it.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.557
August made a boss move
to save her own ass.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.038
You both have keys
to each other's houses,

10:48.082 --> 10:50.127
yet she didn't give a damn
about you.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.044
Just do your thing,
but don't be a stranger.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.133
[laughter]

10:58.832 --> 11:01.399
- Hey. Do you wanna...
get together soon?

11:01.443 --> 11:03.053
Drinks? My place?

11:03.097 --> 11:06.274
- I'd love that.
Text me a time, I'll be there.

11:10.017 --> 11:12.759
[Yvette]: Quincy, I'm so glad
you are heading up security.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.152
And you're a quirky fellow too.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.806
[laughter]

11:16.850 --> 11:19.243
- This is a dope house.
[laughter]

11:19.287 --> 11:22.986
- Yeah, but I like furniture
I can actually sit on.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.901
- I hear you.
[laughter]

11:24.945 --> 11:27.687
So what was the key to success
for your brother?

11:27.730 --> 11:31.081
- Worked his ass off.
He had a vision.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.432
I remember when I was working
at the Social Security office,

11:34.476 --> 11:37.479
this woman came in
and her hair was jacked.

11:37.522 --> 11:41.744
That's when I knew
God was sending me a sign.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.746
I started my wig company.

11:43.790 --> 11:48.577
I work harder than anyone
to make Black women
feel beautiful.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.928
- Well, you don't have to work
too hard to make yourself
beautiful.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.582
Want some chocolate?
- Oh.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.540
- Ooh. What's this?

11:55.584 --> 11:59.370
- That's a Yoruba king's crown,
worn for special ceremonies.

11:59.414 --> 12:03.505
My brother and the collector
almost went to blows over it
at an auction.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.464
- Oh. He's a bit of a fighter.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.511
Wouldn't doubt if he left
a few enemies in his wake.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.861
- My brother was loved. Huh.

12:11.905 --> 12:16.170
When necessary, he could be
an equal-opportunity asshole.
[laughter]

12:16.213 --> 12:18.259
Once, last year,

12:18.302 --> 12:21.610
he had a major blow-up
with one of our distributors.

12:21.653 --> 12:25.875
Reggie was intent on crippling
their company and putting them
out of business.

12:25.919 --> 12:30.314
- Hey, Quincy.
Keeping House of Kings safe
as our new head of security?

12:30.358 --> 12:33.448
Can I talk to you for a second?
Uh, alone.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.146
- Oh.
- Thank you. Thanks.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.542
So you find any skeletons
in my daddy's walk-in closet?

12:40.585 --> 12:44.285
As a matter of fact, I have
a list of three strong suspects

12:44.328 --> 12:45.939
who could've been
extorting your father.

12:45.982 --> 12:48.028
- My dad didn't have
three enemies.

12:48.071 --> 12:51.074
- We all have at least
three people who don't like us.
- Uh...

12:51.118 --> 12:55.122
- Your father was a CEO
and top surgeon.
He probably had a stadium full.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.386
First, there's Larry Samuels,

12:58.429 --> 13:00.214
that guy behind
the Ponzi scheme.

13:00.257 --> 13:03.217
Reginald pissed him off when
he threatened to expose him.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.872
Then there's Otis,
the groundskeeper.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.743
- Otis worshipped my dad.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.225
- I wouldn't be so sure
about that.
- And the third?

13:11.268 --> 13:13.967
- Your mom mentioned
a malpractice suit?

13:14.010 --> 13:17.231
- Yes. My dad had a patient;
they died of natural causes,

13:17.274 --> 13:19.581
but the family did not see
the death that way.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.366
So they sued, they lost.
And we got
a couple hate letters.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.240
Listen, whoever's behind this,
they're gonna strike again
at the end of the month,

13:26.283 --> 13:29.156
so I want some concrete leads
in the next few days.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.898
- I'm not putting up with this!
- Good.

13:31.941 --> 13:35.945
Pack up your crystals
and pedal on back to the grape
juice factory where you belong.

13:37.294 --> 13:41.255
- Dana! What's going on?
- Getting rid of a line item
in my budget.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.171
- Why has he hired
another winemaker?
- He wouldn't do that.

13:44.214 --> 13:48.610
- Then who is the dapper man
in the knock-off Saint Laurent

13:48.653 --> 13:51.961
creeping around my workspace,
sniffing on my grapes?

13:52.005 --> 13:54.181
- Dana?
- He's not in your space.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.792
He's working in an extra room
in the production facility
until you leave.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.187
- Are you insane?
- She's costing us a fortune.

14:00.230 --> 14:03.494
I had to stop the bleeding
because you wouldn't.
I hired Preston,

14:03.538 --> 14:06.715
an up-and-coming savant
who everyone in town
is buzzing about,

14:06.758 --> 14:08.325
and who comes in
at half her price.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.588
- No, no, no.
Grace is a legend.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.026
- A past-her-prime legend.
- Did he just call me old?

14:13.069 --> 14:15.419
- Grace, just give me a minute.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.509
- You get one minute!
On the second, I'm out of here!

14:18.553 --> 14:21.556
- Dana, we can't lose Grace
and Bridgette.
The company will fall apart.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.428
We made a deal to work together
as a team.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.691
And then, you go and hire
another winemaker
behind my back?

14:26.735 --> 14:28.737
What happened
to "I'm your ally"?

14:28.780 --> 14:32.436
- This is business.
- You're undermining me.
- I'm finding solutions.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.918
Grace can't just keep texting us
asking for another $5,000.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.660
- You fire that wannabe savant
or I will.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.445
- Hold up. First let's find out
who's better.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.795
What's wrong with a little
Top Chef in this bitch?

14:43.839 --> 14:48.061
- Uh, in case you forgot,
I'm in charge of this rodeo.
This is my wine.

14:48.104 --> 14:51.934
- In case you forgot,
Dad didn't run this winery
like a dictatorship.

14:51.978 --> 14:55.329
The bylaws state that we put it
to a family vote if there's
a creative conflict.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.114
- That's in case of emergencies.
- What do you call this?

14:58.158 --> 15:00.725
Have cuckoo over there whip up
her best sample.

15:00.769 --> 15:04.077
We'll put it against Preston's,
have everyone taste and decide.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.863
If Grace is still the badass
that she used to be,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.865
you'll have nothing
to worry about.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.313
- Open up,
Melanie Octavia Pierce!

15:25.011 --> 15:27.927
What else was going on
with you and my husband?!

15:29.406 --> 15:31.104
Open the goddamn door!

16:23.765 --> 16:26.942
[chuckling]
Of course it's her birthdate.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.858
Not a creative bone
in her body.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.384
We never went to the beach.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.302
You said you hated sand.
You liar!

16:39.824 --> 16:42.349
[door opening]
[laughter]

16:45.091 --> 16:46.527
Oh!

16:47.397 --> 16:50.009
[indistinct chatter]
[laughter]

16:50.052 --> 16:52.359
- ...look at you.
[laughter]

16:52.794 --> 16:55.840
- Oh! Oh, no, she was mad.
- Oh.

16:55.884 --> 17:00.019
- She thought we were gonna
spend so much more.
- Oh, I spent a lot.

17:00.062 --> 17:05.067
- We need to have a night out
so we can wear some
of these beautiful clothes.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.462
- I'm thinking me,
you and Bridgette
could go out for drinks

17:08.505 --> 17:10.681
and shake our asses
down at the club.

17:10.725 --> 17:15.164
- I don't think so, girl.
Bridgette snapped on me
like a twig yesterday.

17:15.208 --> 17:19.603
- Honey, I'm afraid Vanessa's
going in the same direction.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.431
And I don't want to be there
when it happens,

17:21.475 --> 17:24.869
because baby, it'll be like
the devil was let loose.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.785
- In a pair of Pradas?
[laughter]

17:29.222 --> 17:33.356
- I wish Reggie was here.
He knew how
to keep the family in check.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.142
- But if he were here,
we wouldn't be dealing
with this mess right now.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.058
- I just wish
y'all never got together.

17:39.536 --> 17:43.018
- Sometimes I think that too,
but then,
we wouldn't have had Bridgette.

17:43.801 --> 17:47.544
- I feel guilty
about back in the day
every time I look at her,

17:47.588 --> 17:49.894
'cause you two probably
made her at my house.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.636
- Mm-hmm. And had fun doing it.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.464
[laughter]
- Nasty.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.815
- Ooh, you nasty,
you nasty girl.
[laughter]

17:57.859 --> 18:00.035
- This family will end up
in bankruptcy court

18:00.079 --> 18:02.342
if we don't create
a cheaper dessert wine.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.257
That's why I need your vote.

18:05.388 --> 18:09.000
- Can we just talk about how
you layer in what's unique
about your blend?

18:09.044 --> 18:11.525
- I'm unique and special.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.527
Besides, it's not about
how you market it;

18:13.570 --> 18:15.442
just smile and tell them
your husband made it.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.531
- Dana, don't you want it
to mean something?

18:17.574 --> 18:20.751
- Just do what you always do
and be my rah-rah girl.

18:20.795 --> 18:24.973
We're going to do this.
I can feel it. Ooh. Can't you?

18:25.016 --> 18:27.018
- Of course.
[chuckling]

18:28.890 --> 18:31.675
- Christian,
my favourite brother.

18:31.719 --> 18:35.114
- Who's fine as hell
and could be the next James Bond
or Superman,

18:35.157 --> 18:36.724
but no one's checking
for him yet?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.943
- Yeah.
- And yes, I got your message.

18:38.987 --> 18:41.990
- You know I need you to have
my back on this dessert wine,
though.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.557
I need to beat Dana.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.472
- My wine is like
an affordable wig.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.388
You can luxuriate in it without
spending all the extra money.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.173
- I only fool
with expensive Indian hair.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.262
I don't do
that cheap synthetic mess.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.395
- Grace worked
on Jay-Z's Armand De Brignac.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.440
She worked
on John Legend's Rosé.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.703
[kissing sound]
Everything.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.705
- I cannot deal with this
right now, August.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.881
- But Mom, it's important
I get your vote.

19:03.925 --> 19:06.623
- Yes, and it's important that
you give me some grand-babies.

19:06.667 --> 19:10.366
- Your brother already chased me
down about his blend.
- Okay, well, mine is better.

19:10.410 --> 19:14.675
[sighing]
- The competitive nature
in this family is not healthy.

19:14.718 --> 19:17.504
- Aren't you the one who used
to trip my father in races

19:17.547 --> 19:19.375
just so you could beat him
to the finish line?

19:19.419 --> 19:24.467
[laughing]
- I whooped that ass every time!
- You did!

19:24.511 --> 19:27.470
- Why do I have to tell you
my vote now?
- Because I need to win.

19:27.514 --> 19:31.518
[laughing]
I've had big dreams
for our vineyard for years.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.476
And now's our chance
to do something great.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.610
So what do you say?
Do I have your vote?

19:36.653 --> 19:40.048
- I gotta go.
- Okay, but do I have your vote?

19:40.091 --> 19:43.051
- I need to pray on it.
- Let the Holy Spirit lead you!
[sighing]

19:43.094 --> 19:45.575
- You and Dana
can't work this out by talking?
Humans talk.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.317
- Uh, not in this family.
And you know how ornery he is.

19:48.361 --> 19:52.016
- This patio needs sweeping.
Why is there pebbles
on the ground?!

19:52.060 --> 19:54.410
- Mom? Mom!
What do you think?

19:54.454 --> 19:58.936
- I cannot have tourists
coming in seeing wilted lilies
and dried-up orchids.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.941
Let me know when you want
to discuss my grand-babies.
Got some names picked out.

20:06.030 --> 20:09.077
- Can I count on your vote?
- You know,
I gots to pray on it.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.558
- Look into my eyes.
What do you see?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.953
- A manipulator.
- What?

20:15.997 --> 20:19.305
- People don't change.
They become more
of what they are.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.830
We need you and your brother
to work as one.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.875
You guys used to be inseparable.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.487
You used to tag-team
your parents and convince them

20:27.530 --> 20:31.142
to let you take the company jet
to Jamaica.
What happened?

20:31.186 --> 20:33.014
- We got older
and the stakes got higher.

20:33.057 --> 20:36.844
- All the more reason
for you guys to work together.

20:36.887 --> 20:41.022
You're on opposite sides.
What are y'all gonna do
if there's a tie?

20:41.849 --> 20:43.981
- That's a...
that's a good question.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.070
Hey, Paul?

20:46.114 --> 20:50.858
- Oh, hey, Paul.
- How do we resolve a tie
with the dessert-wine vote?

20:50.901 --> 20:55.950
- Well, after your father died,
his vote automatically passed
to Brigitte.

20:55.993 --> 21:00.607
If there's a split,
you need to talk to her.
She's the deciding factor.

21:02.565 --> 21:06.003
- She'll side with me
because you fired her!
- That's not how it went down!

21:17.580 --> 21:19.626
[knocking]

21:19.669 --> 21:22.150
[knocking]
[sighing]
- She's coming. Just relax.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.588
- I'm relaxed.
- I didn't fire her.
I didn't fire her.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.069
- Hi! I left, like,
five messages.

21:28.112 --> 21:31.333
- Why are you both here?
- She followed me to your place.

21:31.377 --> 21:35.424
Bridgette, sister,
formerly known as cousin,

21:35.468 --> 21:38.035
our dad gave you a vote
in a family matter

21:38.079 --> 21:42.170
and we're having
a little dispute
that we need your help to solve.

21:42.213 --> 21:47.436
- Oh, y'all are swingin'
from the cheap seats today.
First, you fire me,

21:47.480 --> 21:50.874
and now y'all need my vote?
- I know it's a lot,
but this dessert wine

21:50.918 --> 21:53.355
is how we're gonna pay off
the extortionist
and right this ship,

21:53.399 --> 21:55.270
and Dana wants me to fire Grace.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.490
- Wait. Grace is back?

21:57.533 --> 22:01.624
- I want to bring in a young cat
with fresh ideas
who won't break our pockets.

22:01.668 --> 22:05.846
- Y'all won't give me
my job back, but you need my
opinion on who you should hire?

22:05.889 --> 22:10.111
- It's nuanced, I know,
but go with me.
- It's not nuanced, it's insane!

22:10.154 --> 22:13.854
- Listen, if we ever want
to get this out, we just need
to settle the flavours ASAP.

22:13.897 --> 22:17.336
- I'm gonna vote for whatever
is best for me. Now get out.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.164
Out!
- Okay.

22:28.259 --> 22:31.132
- Hey, girl. Where is everyone?

22:31.175 --> 22:34.222
- They're getting their wines
together for this vote, but...

22:34.265 --> 22:36.964
let's get started.
[Yvette chuckling]

22:37.007 --> 22:41.316
- Child, I wish I had time for
those young-folks shenanigans.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.711
I've been too busy
getting my hustle on.
- Hmm.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.539
Oh, is that so?

22:46.582 --> 22:50.194
- Yes. I've been meeting
with distributors all day.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.153
Got a few next week.

22:52.196 --> 22:55.983
I'm about to take our sales
game to the next level.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.856
- And how about selling
your soul?

23:01.336 --> 23:02.598
- Uh...

23:03.469 --> 23:06.602
I better get going.
I got back-to-backs.

23:06.646 --> 23:09.605
I'm a very busy--
- No, wait. Stay. Sit.

23:09.649 --> 23:13.130
Let's talk about your
sister-girl sell-out soul.

23:13.174 --> 23:16.003
It's actually
a very layered topic.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.485
- My soul is good, really.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.574
- Yes, I know your soul, Yvette.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.402
[laughing]: You know, at first,

23:23.445 --> 23:27.406
I was gonna cause a scene
and yell and embarrass you,

23:27.449 --> 23:30.539
but I am going high.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.759
Isn't that
what our First Lady said?

23:32.802 --> 23:35.936
When they go low,
we go high.

23:37.503 --> 23:42.333
- Oh... this wasn't really
a family dinner.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.728
[loud footsteps]
- Do you hear that?

23:45.772 --> 23:47.600
- Sounds like people
going up and down the stairs.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.907
- They are called movers.
- Who's going where?

23:50.951 --> 23:53.780
- They're moving your stuff
outta your room.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.086
- Why the hell
are they touching my stuff?

23:56.130 --> 23:58.480
- Because you're leaving.
- Me?! Why?!

23:58.524 --> 24:00.700
- See, this is what happens
to little wenches

24:00.743 --> 24:04.399
who knew my husband
was sleeping with my sister
and never said a word.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.401
See, that kind
of clandestine behaviour

24:06.445 --> 24:08.534
is saved for Victorian novels
and corsets.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.188
But today, in the 21st century,

24:11.232 --> 24:16.193
we handle things
with badass vigour,
tenacity and vengeance.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.936
It's not enough for me
to block you on Instagram.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.025
I must thoroughly let you know

24:22.069 --> 24:25.072
that I'm gonna drag you
to hell and back!

24:25.115 --> 24:26.769
- Vanessa, I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.205
- I was in Melanie's closet!

24:29.816 --> 24:32.122
I heard everything.
- It's not my fault

24:32.166 --> 24:35.038

- Get out!

24:35.082 --> 24:37.301
- You know I always keep my
mouth shut about the big stuff.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.913
I never told anyone
about the surgery,

24:39.956 --> 24:41.958
or when you got scammed

24:42.002 --> 24:43.960
on that waterfront property
in Kingston.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.964
And I never told anyone
about how you wanted
to abort Dana.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.923
- What?
- Honey.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.490
- What is she talking about?

24:52.578 --> 24:55.276
- Dana, your Aunt Yvette
is lying, honey.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.886
- You wanted to abort me?

24:56.930 --> 24:59.976
- Dana, I can explain
everything. Dana, honey...

25:00.020 --> 25:02.370
Do you see what you did?

25:02.413 --> 25:04.328
Get out of my house!

25:04.372 --> 25:06.026
- What about my job?

25:06.069 --> 25:08.071
- Oh, you will still be
head of sales,

25:08.115 --> 25:11.553
but I will be damned
if I will ever let you lay
your satin bonnet

25:11.597 --> 25:13.773

cotton sheets again!

Who's your favourite artist?

- Mickalene Thomas.
I love her paintings
and her use of material.

25:44.934 --> 25:47.937
- The rhinestones.
- You know her work?

25:47.981 --> 25:49.765
- What?

25:49.809 --> 25:53.116
Oh, you think I'm living under
that 15,000-square-foot roof

to the world?

Was it your dream?

Far from it.
I wanted to write.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.044

- Mm.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.306
- I never knew that.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.395
- Yeah, when Dana and I met,

26:11.439 --> 26:15.748
I was working on a novel.
Part novel, part memoir,
about my childhood,

26:15.791 --> 26:18.315
growing up as a Black
bisexual woman in the West End.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.317

26:21.667 --> 26:24.191
Do you like writing
or PR better?

26:24.234 --> 26:25.888
- I love PR.

26:25.932 --> 26:29.152
Yeah, travelling the world,
meeting with people...

26:30.240 --> 26:32.025
It's just not...

you have.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.818

26:42.862 --> 26:46.953
I did this piece
with Black girls against
baroque backgrounds.

it looked like Kehinde Wiley.

Okay, who am I?

What am I trying to say?

26:55.091 --> 26:57.050
- What did you do?

26:58.051 --> 27:00.923
- I... went to the vineyard,
smoked a blunt,

27:00.967 --> 27:03.099
walked around the vines.

27:03.143 --> 27:06.494

something special to say,

to approach your work
with the vines?

what I'm working with,

32:24.638 --> 32:26.248
like the amount
of pruning required,

32:26.292 --> 32:30.209
soil-sampling frequency,
allocating water to the vines,

32:30.252 --> 32:32.646

a harvest,

32:32.689 --> 32:35.040

that should be harvested.

on handpicking

32:38.086 --> 32:39.609

I prefer handpicking,

32:42.221 --> 32:45.224
where each grape is
attended to specifically.

32:45.267 --> 32:48.488
Honestly, it makes
for a great wine.

No tea, no shade.

my own path.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.329
- I love that.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.852
What you envision
is what you create,

33:04.895 --> 33:06.723

something good.

little differently around here.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.030
shared something in common.

35:20.074 --> 35:23.208
We both believed that quality
doesn't have to be expensive,

35:23.251 --> 35:27.168
that the greatest
pleasures on earth don't have
to cost a fortune.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.431
This dessert wine
should be no different.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.520
Everyone should be able
to enjoy it.

35:31.564 --> 35:35.176
I've created something
that isn't bougie or overpriced.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.484
- Ooh, the shade of it all.

35:39.485 --> 35:43.184
- My dessert wine
is lower-priced,
but it tastes better.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.839
And unlike my sister's wine,

35:45.882 --> 35:51.627
the consumer can relish
in ordering two glasses
at the fancy restaurants.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.327
Enjoy.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.505
[crickets chirping]

36:00.680 --> 36:03.204
- We're ready
for the big moment.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.033
It's time for everybody
to cast their vote.

36:08.035 --> 36:12.082
- So exciting.
I feel like I'm on Big Brother.

36:12.126 --> 36:16.217
- Yeah, except you're the one
who's already booted
out of the house.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.959
- So we know who August and Dana
are voting for.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.527
So Christian, you're up first.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.402
[sighing]
- Sorry, D,

36:27.446 --> 36:30.318
but I gotta go with August's.
Hers was straight fire,

36:30.362 --> 36:32.277
and the coin landed on heads.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.235
- Yvette, your turn.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.803
- Uh, Dana...

36:36.846 --> 36:42.678
I want to apologize
for hurting your feelings
yesterday with my slippage,

36:42.722 --> 36:44.898
which was totally uncalled for,

36:44.941 --> 36:47.814
but August brought
that smoke tonight

36:47.857 --> 36:49.511
and my vote goes to her.

36:49.555 --> 36:53.515
Plus, real talk,
I like smooth wine.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.563
- After that stunt,
you still vote for her?

36:57.606 --> 37:00.218
I see how you are, Yvette.

37:00.261 --> 37:04.309
- I have to separate family
from business, baby.

37:04.352 --> 37:07.486
- Vanessa, what do you say?

37:07.529 --> 37:09.270
- Ahem.

37:09.314 --> 37:13.535
Well, you all I know
I love both of my children.

37:13.579 --> 37:16.756
- Both?
- All of my children.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.716
But the taste and the flavours
in Dana's were impeccable.

37:20.760 --> 37:24.154
So I'm going with
the brilliant genius of Dana,

37:24.198 --> 37:26.983
the son that I've always
cherished and adored.

37:27.027 --> 37:30.726
- Thought that was me.
- Yes, you too, baby. You too.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.729
- And Bridgette, it's your turn.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.949
And it looks like
you're the deciding vote.

37:35.992 --> 37:39.822
- Come on, sis.
Like Stacey Abrams,
you flip that shit.

37:43.739 --> 37:47.439
- Since I've worked
on these vines for many years,

37:47.482 --> 37:49.832
I know what it takes
to make a great wine.

37:49.876 --> 37:53.358
And while I loved both of them,

37:53.401 --> 37:57.971
only one really...
got me here.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.626
This isn't about friendship,

38:00.669 --> 38:04.369
or sisterhood or family,
for that matter.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.240
I voted for Dana.

38:06.284 --> 38:11.637
His was just... better,
point, blank and period.

38:15.205 --> 38:18.818
- Ah, yes! I won!
I got four votes,

38:18.861 --> 38:21.342
and my dessert wine
will lead us to the finish line!

38:21.386 --> 38:24.171
[applause]
- Good job, bro.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.739
- Congratulations, Dana.
[sighing]

38:26.782 --> 38:30.351
- Wait a second.
Have we counted Rose's vote?

38:30.395 --> 38:32.527
- She always sides with Dana.

38:32.571 --> 38:35.138
- Of course she does.
Right, baby?

38:36.618 --> 38:39.447
- Your presentation
was incredible, Dana, really.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.494
It relies on cheaper costs,
higher volume.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.409
But as this company's publicist,

38:44.452 --> 38:48.369
who's successfully had our wines
featured in high-end magazines,

38:48.413 --> 38:51.372
this needs to be an extension
of our label,

38:51.416 --> 38:54.114
something I can fully
get behind and promote.

38:54.157 --> 38:58.336
And, I must say, Grace's blend
is... truly extraordinary.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.512
It has the potential
to give this company

39:00.555 --> 39:03.689
the exclusivity that
Reginald King always desired.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.473
- Land your plane, Rose.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.522
- My vote's going to August.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.221
- Huh.
- Whew.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.396
- Oh!

39:15.440 --> 39:18.530
- Oh, snap, crackle and pop!

39:20.053 --> 39:23.273
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Could you just confirm...

39:23.317 --> 39:26.451
that you're voting against Dana?

39:26.494 --> 39:31.107
- I'm voting my choice,
using my voice.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.545
- Your choice, your voice?

39:33.588 --> 39:35.416
This isn't a feminist
nursery rhyme.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.287
You can't just pop this up
on me now

39:37.331 --> 39:38.724
like you had a conference call
with Dorothy Pittman Hughes!

39:38.767 --> 39:41.640
- I tried talking
to you yesterday

39:41.683 --> 39:43.642
about making your blend unique,

39:43.685 --> 39:46.079
but you're hard-headed, Dana.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.560
You were being very myopic
and you weren't listening to me.

39:48.603 --> 39:50.300
- First my mother tries
to abort me,

39:50.344 --> 39:51.954
and now my wife is throwing me
under the bus?!

39:51.998 --> 39:53.478
- Dana, that's not fair.

39:53.521 --> 39:56.698
- August's wine will help
the company globally.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.439
That's what we've got
to keep our eye on.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.573
- It's one thing for half
my family to not support me.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.966
I'm used to that.
But my own wife?

40:04.010 --> 40:06.099
I'm the reason you're a King!

40:06.142 --> 40:07.970
In fact, I'm the only reason
you're a King!

40:08.014 --> 40:10.233
You were spraying CK One
at the mall when we met.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.584
I only bought a bottle
because I felt bad for you!

40:12.627 --> 40:15.848
- Dana, stop. I understand
you're going through a lot,
but this is too much.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.459
- No, no, no!
She needs to hear this.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.635
This not how our family
does things!

40:21.810 --> 40:23.769
We're about loyalty!

40:23.812 --> 40:26.772
- Stand your ground.
- And legacy.

my love for our wines goes.

40:49.969 --> 40:53.625
And with Grace's
brilliant flavours,

we will finally be able

on some folks.

The ex-patient's family
and your groundskeeper

I need you to dig up every
last bit of dirt on her you can.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.935
I've had enough of her.
