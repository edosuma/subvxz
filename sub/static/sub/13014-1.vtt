00:35.042 --> 00:37.083
Mama, it's so cold.

00:37.125 --> 00:42.708
It's very, very cold, Will.
Put another log on the fire, lad.

00:42.750 --> 00:46.750
There isn't any more firewood, Mama.

00:48.708 --> 00:51.875
Don't worry, Ma.
Jake'll be back soon.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.542
He'll have money for a doctor.

01:02.750 --> 01:05.292
- Did you sell the cow?
- You'll never believe it.

01:05.333 --> 01:09.583
- How much did you get?
- I met a stranger on the road.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.375
Beans?

01:11.417 --> 01:13.083
Magic beans.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.757
- Oh, Jacob.
- Beans?!

01:15.792 --> 01:19.708
He said that they'd make Lotte better
and we'd live happily ever after.

01:19.750 --> 01:23.958
And you believed it? You believed it?!
You idiot! You idiot, Jake!

01:23.993 --> 01:28.167
- She's gonna die because of you!
- Boys, think of your poor sister!

02:14.958 --> 02:16.632
<i>Arrêtez!</i>

02:16.667 --> 02:19.167
Where do you come from, mein Herr?

02:19.202 --> 02:21.708
Kassel, near Frankfurt.

02:23.083 --> 02:26.167
Monsieur, we're looking
for food and lodging.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.257
<i>Passez.</i>

02:30.292 --> 02:32.298
<i>Merci à vous.</i>

02:32.333 --> 02:34.583
<i>Au revoir. Monsieur.</i>

02:44.000 --> 02:49.250
A little something, sir?
Help an old soldier. Help an old soldier, sir.

02:49.292 --> 02:51.708
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.083
God bless you, sir.
God bless you.

02:54.118 --> 02:56.298
Ah!

02:56.333 --> 02:58.208
Oh, God bless you.

03:01.042 --> 03:04.750
- Groom your horses for half a franc.
- Do you know the mayor of this town?

03:04.792 --> 03:06.750
Only groom for the best, sir.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.708
Then give him this.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.167
The Brothers Grimm?

03:15.208 --> 03:17.542
Every second counts.

03:17.583 --> 03:23.542
The witch comes in the dead
of night, when the moon is well-hid.

03:23.583 --> 03:28.792
She comes out of
the darkest, coldest blackness.

03:33.292 --> 03:37.667
Her cry would freeze
the very blood in your veins.

03:37.702 --> 03:40.125
You were right to send for us.

03:41.208 --> 03:45.208
- How many here have seen her?
- Everyone who lives by the mill stream.

03:45.250 --> 03:51.250
It was a hundred years ago. The miller's
wife was burned at the stake for witchcraft,

03:51.292 --> 03:53.715
and they tossed her charred bones
into the river.

03:53.750 --> 03:57.000
Her remains should have been
sealed in a mirror-lined box.

03:57.042 --> 04:03.167
Well, for nights thereafter children saw her
walk the riverbank, beckoning them to her.

04:03.202 --> 04:07.250
- Many did. The mill witch of Karlstadt.
- Yes. We know the legend.

04:07.292 --> 04:11.292
- Then you believe us?
- I'd believe anything you choose to tell me.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.625
Come to my mill.
Such ungodly horrors!

04:14.667 --> 04:18.791
Such banshees screeching.
And if you dare set eyes upon...

04:18.833 --> 04:20.916
Shut up!
Give him his medicine.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.250
Brothers Grimm, we're at our wit's end.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.833
What can you do for us?

04:26.875 --> 04:29.333
It's difficult. Jake?

04:29.375 --> 04:32.417
When you burn a witch,
her soul burns eternally,

04:32.458 --> 04:36.958
so the exorcism of witches
requires a very special method.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.132
- And expensive.
- Only an arrow of innocent tears,

04:40.167 --> 04:44.417
that is child's tears, shot directly
through the heart can put out that fire.

04:44.458 --> 04:48.792
That's the theory.
This is no ordinary witch.

04:48.833 --> 04:53.458
But we've got no one else to turn to.
Can't you help us?

05:01.792 --> 05:04.542
How much?

05:10.375 --> 05:13.292
- You're doing the right thing.
- I hope so.

05:41.417 --> 05:44.007
Whatever happens,
stay behind that shield.

05:44.042 --> 05:48.125
The armor was forged by Prince Richard
the Charming, who awoke Brier-Rose.

05:48.167 --> 05:52.333
- Thank you.
- It reflects the powers of evil.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.417
- Most of the time.
- Right.

05:54.458 --> 05:57.875
- Surprise is critical.
- She mustn't detect us until we're...

06:02.333 --> 06:05.048
...ready for her.

06:05.083 --> 06:07.292
- Hold that.
- Positions.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.062
- Will?
- Ready.

06:12.097 --> 06:13.750
Three, two, one.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.083
Huh?

06:22.333 --> 06:25.875
She's trying to bring the whole place down.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.083
Run!

06:33.458 --> 06:35.708
Take a shot, Jake!

06:35.750 --> 06:38.625
She's here!
She's here! She's here!

06:38.667 --> 06:41.667
- I can't see the heart, Will.
- Lucifer!

06:41.708 --> 06:44.208
Get ahold of yourself, man.

06:47.500 --> 06:51.083
The Brothers Grimm do not fear you.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.375
Reload, Jake.
Don't look her in the eyes.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
- Shoot, Jake.
- Something's wrong.

07:03.042 --> 07:05.417
Hit her in the heart.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.625
- It won't release!
- Don't look in her eyes.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.167
- What?
- Not the eyes.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.833
She's got control over it, Will.

07:18.458 --> 07:21.250
- Fight her, Jacob.
- I can't, Will!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.583
We're brothers, dammit.

07:25.542 --> 07:28.333
Be a Grimm and fight.

07:28.375 --> 07:32.625
We've killed worse than you!

07:32.660 --> 07:34.417
Argh!

07:39.083 --> 07:41.958
Down! Down!
Down! Down! Down!

07:59.250 --> 08:02.750
Stay back.
Back. She's trying to escape.

08:03.667 --> 08:09.500
All souls take corporeal forms,
and when they fail they find places to hide.

08:10.292 --> 08:15.125
Seal these in a mirror-lined box
and bury them far from any river,

08:15.167 --> 08:17.083
and your witch will be gone for good.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.750
You're a brave man.

08:18.785 --> 08:20.958
Take the bag.

08:21.792 --> 08:25.257
Bless you, brothers.
Bless you.

08:25.292 --> 08:29.125
Whoa. We had
a legally binding agreement.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.958
Oh, yes. Yes.
Of course.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.792
Thank you. Thank you.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.298
She... She is dead?

08:38.332 --> 08:40.375
- Yeah, very.
- Course she is.

08:40.457 --> 08:44.625
She's dead.
I must tell the whole town.

08:44.667 --> 08:48.708
She's dead.
Our witch is dead!

08:53.750 --> 08:57.125
That one was a bit of a nightmare.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.340
Don't give me that look.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.500
- I was a scholar once, Will.
- Yeah, now you're famous.

09:04.542 --> 09:07.625
All the girls know your name.
What do you want? An apology?

09:11.958 --> 09:13.708
Blithering idiot!

09:13.750 --> 09:16.708
Your mother was a toothless cow!

09:16.750 --> 09:19.583
Get me down.
Get me down!

09:20.042 --> 09:22.333
Sorry, Hidlick. Slipped.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.917
Fat Christ! What are you doing?
Trying to kill us?

09:24.958 --> 09:27.500
Weren't we supposed to?

09:35.042 --> 09:38.000
God-awful smoke!
You know, just once...

09:38.042 --> 09:41.667
Just once, I'd like to sell it
on the strength of my performance.

09:41.702 --> 09:43.708
Bunst.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.083
Watch out for the...

09:46.125 --> 09:48.667
snap boards.

09:48.708 --> 09:52.750
We do all the flying, the burning, the
scaring, what do we have to show for it?

09:52.792 --> 09:54.048
Talk to Will.

09:54.083 --> 09:57.458
- One tenth. Just like God.
- Exactly, one tenth.

09:57.500 --> 10:01.292
And for the rest, all you have to do
is ride into town and smile.

10:01.333 --> 10:05.083
Yes, well, talk to Napoleon.
Organize your labor, start a guild.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.083
There are two of us. Hm?

10:08.118 --> 10:10.132
Two times ten. Hm?

10:10.167 --> 10:12.208
- We want a twentieth.
- A twentieth?

10:12.243 --> 10:14.250
Each.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.625
Done.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.292
Shrewd thespians.
Now, here's the plan.

10:22.333 --> 10:25.042
Have a couple of days' rest
then meet us in Hamburg.

10:25.083 --> 10:30.625
- Jake knows a legend of a bridge troll.
- Bridge troll. Yes!

10:30.667 --> 10:34.292
How comes he does the monsters,
I play the girlie ghosts?

10:34.375 --> 10:37.958
Because you, my friend, have talent.
You've got range.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.833
What do I have, Will?

10:39.875 --> 10:43.083
You, my handsome friend, have heart.

10:43.125 --> 10:48.583
You, bro, have enough bullshit
to fill the palace of Versailles.

10:49.708 --> 10:54.667
Right. You want the truth of it, boys?
It's a short, brutish struggle, then you die.

10:54.750 --> 10:58.458
Life's little subterfuges
make it all worthwhile.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.417
Well...

11:04.208 --> 11:06.125
Your half, Professor.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.125
Oh.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.292
Would you prefer this in magic beans?

11:11.458 --> 11:14.583
I'll take the beans, thanks, Will.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.625
Stupid!

12:52.917 --> 12:54.625
Who's there?

12:57.958 --> 13:00.132
Hey!

13:00.167 --> 13:02.375
Can you hear me?

13:06.292 --> 13:08.375
Where are you?

13:16.375 --> 13:19.625
Yes, we stood together.
Honestly.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.958
And you were very, very brave,
weren't you?

13:22.993 --> 13:25.750
Who's a brave miller?
You are.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.500
Drink up, dear boy.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.750
Will Grimm. Shall we?

13:37.792 --> 13:41.333
Nothing comes between us brothers.
Not wicked witches.

13:41.375 --> 13:45.500
No. And not vicious beasts in disguise.

13:45.542 --> 13:49.333
And not murderous queens.
No.

13:49.375 --> 13:52.625
Not even Godfather Death.

13:52.667 --> 13:58.958
Because only the truest of truthful love
could ever beat the Grim Reaper.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.833
- Isn't that right, Will?
- Absolutely!

14:01.917 --> 14:03.708
The Grim Reaper!

14:03.750 --> 14:07.583
Oh, I've got a story, I've got a story.
Shush. Shush.

14:07.625 --> 14:11.375
Once upon a time there was an imp
whose name we had to guess.

14:11.417 --> 14:15.042
We had to go right down to
the flaming belly of hell to find out.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.500
But we did it. We did it!

14:17.542 --> 14:21.708
I can tell you what. This business is quite
a lucrative one. Know what I mean?

14:21.750 --> 14:25.167
There is definitely money
to be made in witches.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.875
Jake!

14:26.917 --> 14:31.000
- He can't hold his ale.
- I can't hold my ale!

14:44.000 --> 14:46.208
German pigs!

14:50.750 --> 14:52.542
Bloody French.

14:53.583 --> 14:57.042
Oh, kiss a froggie
and he'll turn into a prince.

14:57.083 --> 14:58.548
Stop it, Jake.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.042
Stop it. You're drunk.
Shut up.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.250
<i>Hello. Bonsoir.</i>

15:09.167 --> 15:11.257
Something full-blooded.

15:11.292 --> 15:13.958
Perhaps a gorgeous
Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.958
Come on. 1792.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.292
A very good year.

15:19.333 --> 15:24.042
<i>Vive la révolution.</i>

15:24.083 --> 15:27.125
On the house.
Oh, no. Don't be too hasty, my friend.

15:27.167 --> 15:30.917
Better to let something like that breathe.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.417
That's the weak piss
Hans brews in the basement.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.958
Nice one. Nice one. So... Ow!

15:39.042 --> 15:42.007
Well, the music seems
to have turned horribly French.

15:42.042 --> 15:46.667
Shall we continue
our little philosophical discussion upstairs?

15:46.750 --> 15:49.812
What do you say, Jake?
A little chit, a little chat.

15:49.847 --> 15:52.875
A little huff, a little puff,
thank you very much, Will.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.750
There he goes.

15:54.833 --> 16:01.083
Mythical damsels and princesses
are all he's really concerned with.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.173
Very well, then. Magic awaits.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.417
I know, we can play my favorite game.

16:06.458 --> 16:10.292
It's called Who's the Fairest of Them All?

16:10.333 --> 16:13.000
Beans, Jake. Beans.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.583
Beans!

16:15.625 --> 16:17.333
Ah, you're an idiot!

16:17.375 --> 16:20.958
Wait for me, now, ladies.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.007
Beans.

16:27.042 --> 16:29.833
Will, they're magic beans.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.507
No, they're magic beans, Will.

16:32.542 --> 16:38.042
And the giants will crush you
and rip out your heart.

16:39.833 --> 16:40.882
Shh!

16:40.917 --> 16:43.167
<i>Gute Nacht. Herr Grimm.</i>

16:47.917 --> 16:50.167
Grimm!

16:50.208 --> 16:52.958
Ik, ik, ak, ek, ek.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.583
- What's going on?
- How can you speak in this language?

16:56.625 --> 17:00.667
Every word is like an execution.

17:02.167 --> 17:04.666
<i>Benne. Benne.</i>

17:04.708 --> 17:07.250
Your horses are ready.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.750
<i>Avanti!</i>

17:14.583 --> 17:18.333
You've got a rope
tied around your foot.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.166
<i>Ciao.</i>

17:39.333 --> 17:41.750
- Run!
- Will! Will, wait!

17:41.792 --> 17:44.333
- Never fear, Jake.
- Will!

17:44.375 --> 17:45.375
Will!

17:45.417 --> 17:47.792
I shall return for you.

17:51.042 --> 17:52.542
Nice try.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.750
Hey, hey! Heagh!

18:00.667 --> 18:04.417
Signore, with bounteous pleasure,

18:04.458 --> 18:08.167
I, Mercurio Cavaldi, present to you

18:08.208 --> 18:10.750
the renowned, the legendary,

18:10.792 --> 18:13.250
the General Vavarin Delatombe,

18:13.292 --> 18:18.583
the military commander of the kingdom
of Westphalia, formerly known as...

18:18.618 --> 18:20.792
- No, no, no.
... Hesse.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.792
Exactly what am I enduring here?

18:25.875 --> 18:29.583
Can someone please tell me
who gave birth to this?

18:29.625 --> 18:33.167
It's Bavarian blood sausage,
with sauerkraut.

18:33.208 --> 18:35.333
I gutted the pig myself.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.667
- I bet you did.
- Grimmy,

18:39.708 --> 18:42.667
you are to have to stand trial

18:42.750 --> 18:46.042
for subterfuge, theft,

18:46.083 --> 18:48.292
and buggery.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.458
I'm sorry?

18:50.500 --> 18:54.500
For which the minimum sentence is...

18:57.042 --> 19:00.167
- Death.
- Oh, no, no. Hang on.

19:00.208 --> 19:04.208
- That's absolutely unnecessary.
- There's been a mistake here.

19:06.167 --> 19:09.583
These country people, they believe things.

19:09.625 --> 19:13.000
We do this just to test them for science.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.750
- Stop. Stop it.
- Ow.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.792
No, no, no.

19:35.292 --> 19:37.667
Are those... snails?

19:37.708 --> 19:41.208
- Snails.
- Your friends have told us everything.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.542
Everything except one thing.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.708
Where are the children of Marbaden?

19:46.750 --> 19:53.208
<i>- What children?
- Nine cute little bambini gone! Vanished.</i>

19:53.250 --> 19:55.083
- We've never been to Marbaden.
- No.

19:55.125 --> 19:58.000
Open up the cauldron.

20:00.375 --> 20:03.000
- No, no. Wait, no!
- Wait, wait!

20:03.083 --> 20:05.375
- I haven't done anything. Please.
- Please!

20:05.417 --> 20:08.667
- By my honor I swear. I swear!
- We didn't do it!

20:08.708 --> 20:10.542
Of course you didn't.

20:10.583 --> 20:13.000
We have been observing you
for some time.

20:13.035 --> 20:14.917
Cavaldi, stop.

20:14.958 --> 20:16.458
Huh?

20:18.375 --> 20:20.750
Please.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.542
No, he said stop it!

20:33.958 --> 20:38.208
However, someone in Marbaden
is working as you.

20:38.250 --> 20:41.375
Same talents, same tricks.

20:41.417 --> 20:44.500
It is a thorn in my toe.

20:45.083 --> 20:50.000
You pull it out,
I might be persuaded to offer you amnesty.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.708
So you mean, if we work for you...

20:53.750 --> 20:56.542
- That's right, Jacob.
... French?

20:56.583 --> 20:58.708
<i>Bien sûr.</i>

20:58.750 --> 21:00.840
Go to Marbaden.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.521
Unmask these villains.

21:03.556 --> 21:06.167
Find the missing children.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.167
Hans, we have to stay
where we can still see the village.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.500
Not if we're going to find the missing girls.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.542
We're going too far.

21:17.583 --> 21:21.083
Greta, nothing has ever happened
to anyone in daytime.

21:21.125 --> 21:27.333
And in the very middle of the wood
was the witch's gingerbread house.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.625
Hans!

22:08.958 --> 22:11.500
Hey! Come back!

22:16.625 --> 22:18.708
Got ya!

22:30.375 --> 22:33.167
Greta! Greta!

23:58.292 --> 24:02.000
Lieutenant, keep your eyes open.

24:02.042 --> 24:04.875
Sergeant, they are mine.

24:09.125 --> 24:13.083
You go and sell

24:13.125 --> 24:15.708
your oil of snake, Grimmy.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.750
Good people of M... Agh!

24:28.792 --> 24:30.542
It was a long trip.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.146
People of Marbaden.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.542
Hello. Anyone there?

24:38.708 --> 24:40.917
Anybody there?

24:42.292 --> 24:43.632
Say, brother.

24:43.667 --> 24:47.792
Why don't you have a look round? Make
sure there's no French soldiers anywhere.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.167
We wouldn't want to run into any French...

24:50.202 --> 24:52.083
Oh. Hey, morning. Hello.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.458
Will, there's a...

24:54.493 --> 24:56.125
Ah. Morning.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.417
- What..?
- Hello.

25:04.792 --> 25:06.417
Who are you?

25:06.458 --> 25:08.833
- Allow me.
- Uh...

25:09.250 --> 25:12.417
<i>Grimm is the name. Two ms.</i>

25:13.167 --> 25:15.333
We are the Brothers Grimm.

25:18.375 --> 25:22.167
- They don't know who we are.
- Stand aside, Gregor.

25:22.208 --> 25:24.125
I'll deal with this.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.042
What's your business?

25:26.083 --> 25:29.042
We're here to save your land
from evil enchantments.

25:30.292 --> 25:34.292
Too late.
The old ways have returned.

25:37.125 --> 25:39.292
You handle it, Jake.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.840
Uh...

25:40.875 --> 25:44.208
Well, we're from Kassel, near Frankfurt.

25:45.125 --> 25:48.542
- We've heard about your missing children.
- Food for trolls.

25:48.583 --> 25:52.042
Hold your tongue, you old witch,
or you'll get another ducking.

25:52.083 --> 25:54.625
Papa, Papa!
They can help us.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.583
Stay back.

25:57.625 --> 26:02.292
It's all right. They're the Brothers Grimm.
People talk about them in Malsburg.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.167
Right you are, son.
The famous Brothers Grimm.

26:05.202 --> 26:07.250
Look at this strapping young lad.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.500
"He" is my daughter.

26:11.250 --> 26:14.250
And a fine wife he'll make some lucky man.

26:14.292 --> 26:18.542
- They kill trolls and giants, Papa.
- That's right. Of course we do, darling.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.750
Jake, me...

26:20.792 --> 26:22.958
the team.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.792
Team Grimm at your service.

26:27.833 --> 26:31.632
We were trying to find
and rescue the others.

26:31.667 --> 26:36.542
Greta was afraid. She thought there really
was a witch in the gingerbread house.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.458
Then birds stole our trail of crumbs.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.417
It was a trap.
The forest made it.

26:42.458 --> 26:45.375
Yes. Yes, it took my daughter too.

26:45.417 --> 26:47.048
- Mine too.
- And mine.

26:47.083 --> 26:51.250
- Ten girls are missing.
- Trees themselves set upon her.

26:51.292 --> 26:55.417
Up and snatched her away.
Just left her little riding cape.

26:55.458 --> 26:56.798
Like a wolf.

26:56.833 --> 26:59.875
And when my daughter ran, it took flight.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.750
Do you understand?
It flew!

27:02.792 --> 27:04.590
Flying beast.

27:04.625 --> 27:09.000
Rope pulley. Snap boards.
Fishing line. Wolf pelt. It's expensive.

27:09.042 --> 27:13.417
Our people always knew
that the forest was enchanted.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.340
But it's never turned against us.

27:15.375 --> 27:19.000
- Until now.
- Until the French occupation.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.583
And it's all
the fault of the French!

27:33.333 --> 27:35.750
<i>Silenzio!</i>

27:41.833 --> 27:44.792
Good citizens,

27:44.833 --> 27:47.750
you have nothing further to fear.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.708
The Brothers Grimm are with you now.

27:50.750 --> 27:54.000
Your salvation is at hand.

27:55.208 --> 27:59.083
Now, we need a guide.
Someone who knows the forest.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.667
- There is one.
- Who?

28:04.708 --> 28:07.458
- Who?
- Who?

28:07.500 --> 28:10.417
- The trapper.
- The cursed one.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.000
Perfect.

28:25.125 --> 28:28.042
Excuse me, Herr Krauss?

28:29.333 --> 28:31.042
Um...

28:32.042 --> 28:35.542
Hello, there. We've come
to help find the missing children.

28:35.577 --> 28:38.792
We'll only need a few hours of your time.

28:40.292 --> 28:41.375
Oh.

28:41.417 --> 28:44.500
Sorry. Is your father here?

28:46.583 --> 28:48.625
Husband?

28:50.375 --> 28:53.083
Is there a man of any..?

28:54.792 --> 28:56.833
Cursed.

28:59.792 --> 29:05.125
Miss Krauss, perhaps you don't realize
who we are. We're the Brothers Grimm.

29:05.167 --> 29:08.625
We vanquished the mill witch of Karlstadt,
the frog boy of Glutenhof,

29:08.667 --> 29:14.833
and the cannibal chef of the Schwarzwald
in the gingerbread house of terror.

29:14.875 --> 29:19.125
Miss, we need a guide, someone
who knows the paths through the forest.

29:27.042 --> 29:29.250
We'll pay you money.

29:31.083 --> 29:36.042
Well, beads and... pretty shiny things
from the big city.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.167
Oh...

29:38.250 --> 29:42.833
Miss, we believe your village
may be under some kind of curse.

29:42.875 --> 29:45.000
Think I care about the village?

29:51.958 --> 29:53.292
<i>Scusi.</i>

29:53.333 --> 29:57.292
But he was trying to run away.

30:05.917 --> 30:09.417
Are you aware that ten girls in this village
have gone missing?

30:09.458 --> 30:12.875
Two of those girls were my sisters.

30:12.917 --> 30:18.375
If your sisters are lucky sisters,
they are dead sisters.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.958
Who's your friend?

30:20.993 --> 30:23.080
- Um...
- I?

30:23.115 --> 30:25.167
Who am I?

30:25.208 --> 30:29.458
I am Mercurio Cavaldi,
of the great Cavaldis of Parma,

30:29.500 --> 30:33.250
the master of the torturing arts.

30:33.285 --> 30:35.625
Steady, Cavaldi.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.167
We need her warm and breathing.

30:44.667 --> 30:50.042
Good people of Marbaden,
your daughters will be returned.

30:50.077 --> 30:56.250
And you shall regain
your courage and your joy.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.625
To the forest!

31:02.667 --> 31:04.250
Hah! Hah!

31:11.375 --> 31:12.417
Cursed!

31:29.667 --> 31:32.542
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.

31:32.583 --> 31:34.708
That's my brother Jake.

31:38.375 --> 31:41.083
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.

31:41.118 --> 31:42.875
- That's my brother...
- Angelika.

31:42.917 --> 31:45.375
Lovely.
Whatever trickster we're hunting -

31:45.417 --> 31:49.542
and by "trickster" of course I mean
"demon" - he's got to have a hideout.

31:49.583 --> 31:52.000
He's got to have a base of operations.

31:52.035 --> 31:55.167
For example, these caves here.

31:55.250 --> 31:58.750
Nothing there.
Just animal bones and old drawings.

31:58.792 --> 32:02.250
Nine times out of ten,
there's a human perpetrator.

32:03.708 --> 32:06.125
Apparently we're on foot from here.

32:06.167 --> 32:08.500
Why?
Why we go this way?

32:08.542 --> 32:10.340
Why?

32:10.375 --> 32:14.292
Because even the animals
would never come this way.

32:17.833 --> 32:21.417
- No weapons?
- Weapons, uh...

32:21.458 --> 32:24.042
We keep the weapons.

32:24.083 --> 32:27.542
We work with other tools, Angelika.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.208
Don't be afraid.

32:50.250 --> 32:53.958
I know this sophisticated technology
must look very strange to you.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.792
- What exactly is it meant to do?
- Shh!

33:07.167 --> 33:08.882
Right.

33:08.917 --> 33:11.167
I feel it's safe to proceed.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.417
You understand,
this really is exciting for us.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.542
Our folk tales
sprang from places just like this.

33:23.583 --> 33:29.875
I mean, it's funny, everywhere you look
you can feel the forest's ancient power.

33:34.042 --> 33:35.673
I mean... Ough!

33:35.708 --> 33:38.833
I mean, to our ancestors
this place was sacred.

33:38.875 --> 33:42.833
Till the Christians invaded.
Now it's just territory.

33:42.868 --> 33:45.125
Territory?

33:50.250 --> 33:51.882
Oh. Oh!

33:51.917 --> 33:53.548
Heavens above!

33:53.583 --> 33:56.125
Will. Will, look at this.

33:56.167 --> 34:00.917
- So the Christian king built all this?
- In the middle of the forest?

34:00.958 --> 34:02.958
They cut it down.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.958
It grew back.

34:18.667 --> 34:21.125
I thought you said
the animals don't come here.

34:21.167 --> 34:24.583
The animals don't drink from the spring.

34:25.167 --> 34:27.208
<i>Merde!</i>

34:28.375 --> 34:30.090
I mean...

34:30.125 --> 34:32.000
<i>Scheiße. Urgh!</i>

34:32.042 --> 34:33.792
<i>Scheiße!</i>

34:37.500 --> 34:42.542
Are you feeling it, Will? I sense, so far,
dread. It's almost like a smell.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.625
Of death.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.833
Excuse me. Sorry.

34:49.750 --> 34:54.167
You're not afraid, are you?
Not like the villagers.

35:02.583 --> 35:04.375
Ah, so, um...

35:05.292 --> 35:06.840
What happened here?

35:06.875 --> 35:10.375
The Christian king
destroyed the forest people.

35:10.417 --> 35:13.083
Burnt them to death in the caves.

35:13.125 --> 35:15.500
What an awful story.

35:15.542 --> 35:17.958
They were the lucky ones.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.250
A year later the plague came.

35:20.292 --> 35:23.958
Jake, we really should search the tower.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.083
There's no way in.

35:29.042 --> 35:30.833
Never was.

35:30.917 --> 35:32.271
<i>Angelika.</i>

35:32.306 --> 35:33.590
Angelika.

35:33.625 --> 35:38.375
Look. You see that window?
Way, way up high.

35:38.417 --> 35:43.208
Many centuries ago,
that's where the queen lived.

35:44.208 --> 35:47.479
<i>She was treasured by all of Europe.</i>

35:47.514 --> 35:50.750
<i>Famed for her incredible beauty.</i>

35:50.792 --> 35:53.625
<i>But also vain and selfish.</i>

35:53.667 --> 35:57.500
<i>Her world was her own reflection.</i>

35:57.542 --> 36:02.292
<i>It was on the queen's wedding day
that the plague arrived.</i>

36:04.708 --> 36:07.958
<i>The king was the first to die.</i>

36:08.833 --> 36:11.417
<i>His bride built a tower.</i>

36:12.292 --> 36:16.208
<i>She locked herself away.
Safe from the horrors below.</i>

36:16.250 --> 36:21.542
<i>But what she forgot was that
plague is carried on the winds.</i>

36:22.958 --> 36:30.333
When she first fell sick and
her gorgeous flesh began to rot away,

36:30.375 --> 36:35.417
they say you could hear her screams
across the oceans.

36:37.417 --> 36:40.833
My princess isn't afraid, is she?

36:41.708 --> 36:44.208
It's just an old story.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.708
Papa's here to protect you.

36:52.125 --> 36:54.840
<i>The Cursed Ruins.</i>

36:54.875 --> 36:59.042
<i>Oh, yeah. Now, that's good. Uh-huh.
The Cursed Ruins.</i>

37:00.167 --> 37:02.292
<i>Ruins. By Ja...</i>

37:06.042 --> 37:07.083
Hm.

37:08.083 --> 37:11.917
<i>Cursed Ruins by Jac...</i>

37:15.292 --> 37:18.042
Mm-hm. Hm.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.583
By Jacob Grimm.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.750
Will.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.250
Will. Will!

37:57.333 --> 37:59.875
Argh! Ha!

38:07.167 --> 38:08.333
Oh!

38:15.292 --> 38:18.875
I'll kill you and take your eggs
and smash them all in and...

38:29.500 --> 38:32.875
Spooky, spooky, spooky.

38:41.708 --> 38:45.417
I'm afraid my instruments
aren't detecting much.

38:45.458 --> 38:49.083
Let's call it a day before it gets,
you know, too dark.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.583
- We should leave.
- Angelika.

38:51.625 --> 38:54.500
Excuse me, uh...

38:54.542 --> 38:57.875
- We came from that direction.
- That's not the way.

38:57.917 --> 39:00.417
We walked right past those birds' trees.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.417
- It's this way.
- That's the way we are walking out.

39:03.750 --> 39:07.083
Don't trust the trees.

39:11.875 --> 39:13.792
Hello, Grandmother Toad.

39:15.250 --> 39:18.333
- Show us the path.
- Oh, God.

39:18.375 --> 39:21.458
Show us the way and I'll give you a kiss.

39:23.250 --> 39:26.542
Oh, my, that's just not right.

39:27.583 --> 39:29.833
Sh, sh, sh.

39:34.625 --> 39:36.292
That way.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.167
You're sure, Grandmother?

39:39.208 --> 39:41.333
As I thought.

39:42.542 --> 39:44.833
- Yeah, right.
- You don't believe me?

39:44.875 --> 39:46.917
Well...

39:46.958 --> 39:49.167
Taste for yourself.

39:58.833 --> 40:02.000
- We did not come this way.
- What's her game?

40:02.042 --> 40:04.417
I don't think she's putting it on, Will.

40:04.452 --> 40:06.792
There was some kind of
presence back there.

40:06.833 --> 40:08.757
Oh, shut up, Jacob!

40:08.792 --> 40:12.167
Did you fall for this spooky dance number?
You mooncalf.

40:12.208 --> 40:13.417
Mooncalf?

40:13.458 --> 40:18.208
She is up to something. I don't trust her.
I'd slip her the goldfish but I...

40:18.250 --> 40:20.333
And here we are.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.333
Nicely done, Angelika.
Knew you'd find it.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.465
Hey, hey.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.708
Here, boy. Whoa.

40:30.625 --> 40:32.667
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

40:32.702 --> 40:34.667
Calm down.

40:38.208 --> 40:39.625
Oh.

40:41.250 --> 40:43.833
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

40:43.868 --> 40:46.500
Whoa.

40:58.583 --> 41:03.875
Fruitful expedition. Many things
learned. Many things learned indeed.

41:03.917 --> 41:05.625
Won't be long now.

41:05.667 --> 41:07.708
Sasha.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.917
Shall we regroup at dawn tomorrow?

41:10.958 --> 41:13.979
Give you boys enough time
for your beauty sleep.

41:14.014 --> 41:17.000
- You're on your own tomorrow.
- Sorry. What?

41:17.042 --> 41:19.000
I said, you're on your own tomorrow.

41:19.042 --> 41:21.458
- What's she say?
- She said we're on our own.

41:21.500 --> 41:24.208
You forced me to show you the forest.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.375
I showed you the forest.

41:27.292 --> 41:30.375
It's all right.
I'll handle this one.

41:31.375 --> 41:33.958
Would you hitch my horse, Will?

41:36.458 --> 41:38.708
Are you all right?

41:39.500 --> 41:41.708
Can I come in?

41:45.125 --> 41:47.542
These drawings are very good, you know.

41:47.583 --> 41:50.083
I do a bit of drawing myself.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.208
I'm not bad.

41:55.083 --> 41:56.875
Angelika,

41:56.917 --> 42:01.583
there was power in that place,
wasn't there? The tower.

42:02.292 --> 42:04.958
Father used to take us there.

42:05.292 --> 42:07.917
And where is he now?

42:07.958 --> 42:10.417
- He died.
- Oh.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.458
Last winter.
They say the wolves took him.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.458
The wolves?

42:15.500 --> 42:18.708
Look, if you won't guide us,
would you at least give us a map?

42:18.750 --> 42:22.667
- A map wouldn't do you any good.
- A lot more good than it would do you.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.875
At least we can read.
Come on, Jake.

42:24.917 --> 42:28.625
You people think you know everything.
I've been to the city.

42:28.667 --> 42:32.667
My father saved every penny he earned
to buy me a proper education.

42:32.708 --> 42:34.917
Ah, money down the drain, if you ask me.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.382
You're right.

42:36.417 --> 42:41.125
After he died, my sisters were left alone.
They were the first to be taken.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.750
That's why they call you cursed.

42:44.667 --> 42:46.708
Yeah.

42:49.333 --> 42:55.333
So tell me again, famous Brother Grimm,
how exactly do you intend to save us?

43:01.292 --> 43:04.000
I think I'll do my own searching.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.625
I thought that went rather well.

43:16.167 --> 43:18.542
Gift. For surprise.

43:20.083 --> 43:22.625
For you. Tasty.

43:22.667 --> 43:24.667
Argh!

43:26.917 --> 43:30.000
Such German hospitality.

43:30.083 --> 43:34.167
The Brothers Grimm will thank you
for your kindness.

43:34.208 --> 43:36.083
Oh!

43:44.333 --> 43:46.667
I'm starving.

43:47.625 --> 43:52.708
No, no, no, no, no.
Not for you, my little Cinderellas.

44:08.042 --> 44:10.083
Help me.

44:37.583 --> 44:40.125
There, there.

44:40.167 --> 44:42.667
It's all right.

44:42.708 --> 44:45.375
What a pretty horse you are.

44:46.292 --> 44:48.875
Such big eyes you have.

44:49.792 --> 44:52.625
And big ears you have.

44:52.667 --> 44:57.167
And such a pretty, pretty mouth.

44:58.625 --> 44:59.917
Ugh!

45:23.917 --> 45:26.750
Sorry.

45:28.500 --> 45:30.292
Huh? Where'd that come from?

45:36.917 --> 45:38.583
Ho, hey!

45:38.625 --> 45:40.562
Easy, easy.

45:40.597 --> 45:42.500
Steady, easy.

45:48.750 --> 45:50.875
- Elsie!
- Help!

45:54.125 --> 45:56.937
They could mechanize the horse,
put it on tracks.

45:56.972 --> 45:59.750
- There were no tracks.
- Get out of the way.

45:59.792 --> 46:02.083
Angelika.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.798
- What about mirrors?
- Elsie!

46:03.833 --> 46:06.417
You use a real animal
and a warped mirror.

46:06.458 --> 46:08.917
That as my horse.
That was Pepper.

46:08.958 --> 46:13.423
What is happening?

46:13.458 --> 46:16.083
- I should catch that horse.
- Grimmy?

46:16.125 --> 46:18.375
- You're wearing a bonnet.
- So are you.

46:22.792 --> 46:24.542
Heagh! Heagh!

46:26.833 --> 46:28.750
Heagh!

46:28.792 --> 46:30.958
Faster! Faster, Will.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.250
Dax, Letorc,
don't lose sight of the Grimmy.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.792
Go on. Kick him, kick him, Will!

46:44.083 --> 46:46.000
Ugh!

46:47.708 --> 46:50.042
Tripwires!
There's someone in the woods.

46:50.077 --> 46:52.083
Watch out!

47:02.458 --> 47:06.083
- Will, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- I most definitely am not.

47:17.208 --> 47:19.583
They've put the woods on wheels.

47:20.208 --> 47:23.167
- Those trees on tracks.
- Will...

47:23.208 --> 47:25.833
Pulley system. Expensive.

47:27.792 --> 47:30.333
Control your horses.

47:30.375 --> 47:34.458
<i>Don't lose sight of the Grimmy.
Go, go. Idioti!</i>

47:34.917 --> 47:38.042
I've been looking for you.

47:47.542 --> 47:50.167
Stralda, what's happening?

47:50.202 --> 47:52.792
<i>Avanti. Avanti. Avanti!</i>

47:52.833 --> 47:53.792
Gie, gie, gie!

48:06.917 --> 48:09.167
You can see they're on tracks.

48:11.375 --> 48:14.208
- Show yourselves!
- There, there, there!

48:14.833 --> 48:17.083
Can you hear me?

48:20.458 --> 48:23.375
What is this, Grimms?
What is happening?

48:23.417 --> 48:26.375
These people are
much better funded than we are.

48:29.458 --> 48:32.000
Get down! Get down.

48:45.292 --> 48:46.500
Wait!

48:49.125 --> 48:51.458
Stop, Will.

48:55.250 --> 48:57.542
Help me!

48:57.583 --> 48:59.833
Help!

48:59.875 --> 49:03.667
<i>Aschenputtel!</i>

49:11.125 --> 49:13.292
Run! Run!

50:08.500 --> 50:10.667
His eyes.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.625
His eyes.

50:18.958 --> 50:21.208
My hair.

50:29.542 --> 50:31.458
Letorc?

50:31.500 --> 50:33.333
Dax?

50:33.375 --> 50:38.958
Can you hear my voice?
I command you, fall in.

50:41.542 --> 50:44.667
How many times do I have to tell you?

51:00.375 --> 51:03.083
There you go. Can't breathe.

51:03.125 --> 51:06.333
This is so incredible.

51:06.375 --> 51:09.833
This changes everything.
Gotta write this down. That was real.

51:09.917 --> 51:14.833
Beans, Jake. Magic beans. There is
a rational explanation for all of this.

51:14.875 --> 51:17.833
What do you mean?
Rational explanation? The bugs were...

51:17.875 --> 51:19.875
And the forest was sweeping down on us.

51:19.917 --> 51:21.382
Stop it, Jake!

51:21.417 --> 51:24.000
- It was like everything was under a spell.
- Or curse.

51:24.035 --> 51:27.458
- What?
- My whole family's cursed.

51:28.333 --> 51:31.208
My father...
Father...

51:32.208 --> 51:34.917
- What about your father?
- I have to go back.

51:34.952 --> 51:37.292
Angelika...

51:38.167 --> 51:41.292
<i>On the ground.
On the ground, crucchi bastardi!</i>

51:41.327 --> 51:45.708
Go down, now!
On the ground.

51:45.750 --> 51:50.083
Now, who killed my men, huh?

51:50.125 --> 51:52.333
You tell me, Grimmy.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.542
Who? Or she will die.

51:54.583 --> 51:57.167
It was the forest.

51:57.208 --> 51:59.625
German peasant.

52:00.250 --> 52:03.458
And if you stay it will destroy you too.

52:05.542 --> 52:07.417
<i>Mesdames et messieurs.</i>

52:07.458 --> 52:12.000
The emperor honors me with a visit
from you, his most trusted advisors.

52:15.750 --> 52:17.583
I salute you.

52:17.625 --> 52:22.708
Your shining examples illuminate
this dark German forest of ignorance and...

52:22.750 --> 52:25.458
<i>Dov'è il generale?</i>

52:26.917 --> 52:28.917
<i>Ah! Il generale!</i>

52:28.952 --> 52:30.917
Finally, finally!

52:33.375 --> 52:34.583
General... Ah!

52:34.625 --> 52:37.167
<i>Guten Tag. Buongiorno.</i>

52:37.208 --> 52:38.958
<i>Bonjour.</i>

52:39.000 --> 52:41.708
<i>Bonjour.</i>

52:42.708 --> 52:47.167
General, your soldiers...

52:47.208 --> 52:48.257
<i>finito.</i>

52:48.292 --> 52:50.375
They are dead.

52:50.417 --> 52:53.125
I'm lucky survived. See?

52:53.167 --> 52:56.792
Here, just this little wound.

52:56.833 --> 53:00.458
Just a little, little itchy scratch.

53:18.417 --> 53:21.417
We begin with lobster bisque.

53:21.458 --> 53:22.417
Ah!

53:22.458 --> 53:24.417
You embarrass me.

53:24.458 --> 53:26.333
You ridicule me!

53:26.375 --> 53:29.667
You insult me in front of my guests.

53:29.702 --> 53:32.375
These people are Parisians.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.333
No, no! Argh!

53:34.417 --> 53:37.292
They tried to blind Cavaldi

53:37.333 --> 53:41.875
with their fairy tales
and devouring trees and flying wolves.

53:41.917 --> 53:44.833
But I use my logical brain, Generale.

53:44.875 --> 53:47.750
I can make this as clear as crystal.

53:47.792 --> 53:51.208
I am in no way responsible.

53:51.250 --> 53:54.625
It is them.
They are the ones.

53:54.667 --> 53:56.917
The Grimmy!

53:59.167 --> 54:02.292
The plan is very simple.

54:02.333 --> 54:05.250
They use the little girls as bait,

54:05.292 --> 54:09.375
they lure your soldiers
into the forest, and, uh...

54:10.292 --> 54:12.333
- Bingo.
- Bingo?

54:12.368 --> 54:14.583
Yes. Shh.

54:14.625 --> 54:16.750
It's bingo.

54:16.792 --> 54:20.771
General, we are outmaneuvered,
outflanked, outnumbered

54:20.806 --> 54:24.750
by some German force
which threatens your superiorit...

54:26.208 --> 54:27.548
Grimms.

54:27.583 --> 54:31.167
What precisely happened in the forest?

54:31.208 --> 54:35.667
General, I believe we witnessed
a case of authenticated enchantment.

54:35.708 --> 54:38.833
We're not saying that.
That is not our official position.

54:38.868 --> 54:40.917
But it's true.

54:41.875 --> 54:43.583
Kill them.

54:43.625 --> 54:45.875
I will deal with you later.

54:45.917 --> 54:48.083
No, monsieur.

54:49.875 --> 54:51.917
Don't kill.

54:51.958 --> 54:56.250
I can make them speak.

54:58.417 --> 55:00.125
<i>Musica.</i>

55:03.792 --> 55:05.000
Huh?

55:09.667 --> 55:11.833
Wait! No! Stop!

55:11.868 --> 55:14.000
No, no, no, no, no!

55:17.833 --> 55:21.000
This is nothing to do with me.
He forced...

55:21.042 --> 55:24.000
- She's innocent. Let her go.
- Stop!

55:24.042 --> 55:29.125
General, you keep working with Cavaldi,
this country won't be yours much longer.

55:29.167 --> 55:34.667
- He panics.
- The great Cavaldi never panics.

55:39.375 --> 55:41.417
Uh...

55:45.333 --> 55:47.208
Hm.

55:47.250 --> 55:49.083
<i>À point.</i>

55:49.792 --> 55:52.417
<i>Bon appétit. Mes chiens.</i>

55:54.458 --> 55:56.542
- Stop!
- General!

55:56.583 --> 55:58.708
Cavaldi was right.

55:58.917 --> 56:01.125
Cavaldi was right.

56:01.458 --> 56:03.333
We saw them. We did.

56:03.625 --> 56:06.500
There was three in the trees,
two in the caves.

56:06.542 --> 56:08.292
Huge men. With weapons.

56:08.333 --> 56:12.542
My masterpiece is working.
Truth comes out.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.917
These are backward people. They cling to
folklore because it gives them strength.

56:17.952 --> 56:20.125
Stop. You're giving them what they want.

56:20.167 --> 56:22.923
The longer this goes on,
the more Germans will talk like her.

56:22.958 --> 56:27.542
- Then arm themselves, organize...
- Then the problem won't be just a forest.

56:27.583 --> 56:29.292
- It shall be a nation!
- Yes!

56:29.333 --> 56:31.000
- Let us do it our way.
- Yes!

56:31.042 --> 56:34.167
- Send us back into the forest.
- Ye... What?

56:35.167 --> 56:37.500
We'll lie in wait
with our men, our equipment.

56:37.542 --> 56:39.917
- No, no...
- General, trust me.

56:39.958 --> 56:42.250
Let us rig a surprise for them.

56:49.250 --> 56:51.333
Cavaldi, stop.

56:52.333 --> 56:54.542
- Huh?
- Stop!

57:13.792 --> 57:16.292
Very well, Grimms.

57:16.333 --> 57:19.625
You shall return to the forest.

57:19.667 --> 57:22.917
But I warn you,
attempt to escape

57:22.958 --> 57:26.000
and I shall raze every tree,

57:26.042 --> 57:28.965
demolish every building,

57:29.000 --> 57:33.042
slaughter every innocent in search of you.

57:33.917 --> 57:35.500
You understand?

57:39.083 --> 57:40.333
<i>Bon.</i>

58:12.375 --> 58:14.583
Mind his head.

58:18.625 --> 58:22.000
Pack the horses with as much gear
as they can carry, all right?

58:22.042 --> 58:26.083
I'm a little unclear
as to who exactly we're up against.

58:26.125 --> 58:29.583
Just stay close to your horse.

58:35.125 --> 58:37.257
Jake. Jake.

58:37.292 --> 58:38.375
- Listen.
- What?

58:38.458 --> 58:40.875
Go and get back on your horse.

58:40.917 --> 58:44.375
- We're gonna make a run for it.
- I remember the rest of the story.

58:44.417 --> 58:46.048
What are you talking about?

58:46.083 --> 58:48.667
- It's an ancient folklore, passed down...
- Jake!

58:48.750 --> 58:52.125
The tower, the queen, her story, it's...

58:52.167 --> 58:53.875
- Before the plague...
- Jacob.

58:53.917 --> 58:59.000
...the queen killed all the villagers'
ancestors to get her hands on their spells.

58:59.042 --> 59:03.417
- And one was a spell for eternal life.
- Give me that stupid book!

59:03.458 --> 59:06.333
- She's still in the tower. She's there now.
- Jake.

59:06.500 --> 59:10.500
You've got to understand something.
This is not about the story.

59:10.542 --> 59:14.208
It's about you and her.
You want to rescue her.

59:14.250 --> 59:16.042
That's right, Will.

59:16.083 --> 59:18.833
Because she's part of the story.

59:24.750 --> 59:28.125
She's still there. Isn't she?
The queen. She's still in the tower.

59:28.167 --> 59:31.083
She's been there for centuries now,
waiting for someone.

59:31.118 --> 59:34.000
To serve her and find
the one spell they kept hidden.

59:34.042 --> 59:37.125
It's just a story to scare children.

59:37.167 --> 59:41.125
Well, now, that's not the truth, Angelika.
I know you believe.

59:41.167 --> 59:45.125
Ignore him. He wishes his whole life
was something out of a book.

59:45.167 --> 59:47.583
- Now he thinks he's in love.
- Shut up, Will!

59:47.625 --> 59:50.000
Angelika, do what your father wanted,
leave now.

59:50.042 --> 59:53.333
- No. I'm going to find my sisters.
- Will doesn't care about them.

59:53.375 --> 59:55.708
Will doesn't care about
anything but himself.

59:55.750 --> 59:58.042
This isn't a fairy tale.
They won't come back.

59:58.083 --> 01:00:01.292
This is not your world, Will!

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:05.125
Angelika.

01:00:05.167 --> 01:00:07.375
You know, don't you?

01:00:08.458 --> 01:00:12.298
The story, it's happening to us now.

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:17.417
We're living it.
It's alive, it's real, it's breathing.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:22.417
And we can give it a happy ending.

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:24.708
Jake...

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:29.000
Angelika, we'll find your sisters.
All right? We'll bring them back.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:32.375
Bring back her sisters?

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.833
Bring them back?

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:39.333
Bring them back with what?
Magic beans?

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:44.583
- Why do you say that?
- Magic beans don't work!

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:49.625
They don't bring people back to life.
They did not then and they will not now.

01:00:49.667 --> 01:00:52.000
You go wait by the horses.

01:00:52.042 --> 01:00:54.292
Jacob, wait by the horses.

01:00:56.167 --> 01:01:00.208
- Sorry.
- He was doing what he thinks is right, Will.

01:01:00.243 --> 01:01:02.167
He was trying to help.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:06.375
- We can not fight the entire forest.
- You're just scared.

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:09.042
Just scared?

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.667
I'm terrified.
You should be too.

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:16.750
Don't you understand? The idea of going
back in there - nothing makes sense there.

01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:20.125
It's like being inside Jake's head.

01:01:22.792 --> 01:01:25.750
God, I hate him.
He makes me...

01:01:25.792 --> 01:01:27.875
He drives me mad.

01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:31.750
He makes you feel weak, doesn't he?

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:35.875
Yeah. He always has done.

01:01:38.375 --> 01:01:40.875
The thing is, I can't...

01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:43.042
Protect him.

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:50.000
My father thought
he could protect his family too, Will.

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:01.542
Pah!

01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:03.667
Jake. Jacob, come back.

01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:05.465
Jake!

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.917
Come back, Jake!

01:02:11.792 --> 01:02:14.083
You're a fool!

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:17.125
Now do you see?
I made that armor.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:20.167
It's not magic, it's just shiny.

01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:25.125
Oh, no!

01:02:27.292 --> 01:02:34.000
<i>This lovely Fräulein
will not be coming with you, caro storyboy.</i>

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.917
She will be staying here with me.

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:39.833
It's all right, Will.
Just go. Go.

01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:53.042
What's this?
It's a mess, that's what it is.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:57.666
It was hardly a snap, was it?

01:02:57.701 --> 01:03:01.083
More tension in the snap board.

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:04.583
- We need the trunks here now.
- What do you suppose I'm doing?

01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:08.042
And this is the last time I'll ask you,
is the chuck basket secure?

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:10.125
- Yes, it's secure.
- It's secure.

01:03:10.167 --> 01:03:12.250
Cor!

01:03:13.167 --> 01:03:18.965
So, if we find these 11 girls,
we don't get guillotined.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Can you believe, these bumpkins actually
think they were devoured by the forest?

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.958
And what exactly do we think?

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.500
- All right. Positions, lads.
- Jake?

01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:42.208
- Check for takeoff.
- Jake!

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.667
- Right, you ready? Steady it.
- Jake!

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:48.042
And three, two, one. Takeoff.

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:51.458
- Woo-hoo!
- No!

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.208
Gargh! Oh!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.625
Jake? Jake?

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:02.271
Jake?

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:03.917
Jacob?

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:09.667
Dammit. Every time.

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:15.125
We need more height. And can we check
the alignment? The alignment is crucial.

01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:17.632
Stop this now, Jacob.
You're going to kill yourself.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:21.583
Oh, good. That's just great,
because then it will just be you, Will,

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:24.708
and you can have anything
and everything that you want.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.125
What is it exactly you do want, Will, huh?

01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:29.417
What? Is it Angelika?
You want her?

01:04:29.452 --> 01:04:31.298
Fine. Take her, she's yours.

01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:36.500
Is it the money? Take that. That's all you
seem to do these days, is take and take.

01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:39.667
Jacob Grimm, you petulant child!

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:44.500
Argh! Oh!

01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:46.792
Ow!

01:04:47.625 --> 01:04:51.375
What was that? Something moved.
I saw something move. Did you?

01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:55.458
D- d-d-don't ask.
Please don't ask me to look.

01:04:56.708 --> 01:05:03.292
All my life I've studied these folk tales, Will,
and now I find one that's for real.

01:05:03.327 --> 01:05:05.375
It's not beans.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.542
It's real.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.208
I mean, don't you understand?

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:16.917
I have to do this.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.833
Ow! Agh!

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.958
All right, Jake.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:31.583
What do you want me to do?

01:05:31.618 --> 01:05:33.792
What? Honestly?

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.042
You're my brother.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.500
I want you to believe in me.

01:05:40.625 --> 01:05:43.000
I need you to help me.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:49.042
All right, lads. Let's launch me off
into the flaming belly of hell.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:52.083
Wait. I think you're overcomplicating it.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:55.042
- What?
- A catapult's not gonna work.

01:05:55.083 --> 01:05:56.507
Yeah, you're right.

01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:58.750
- What other gear do we have?
- Uh...

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.500
- Huh!
- Well, there's the...

01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:05.708
What about the flying-witch rig, with
a grapple and a hook to catch the window?

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.083
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:09.417
We haven't got a hook and grapple.

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:13.042
They'll have hooks at the village.
We'll ride like the wind.

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:16.708
- Will, we've got the hooks, right?
- We'll be no time at all.

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:19.500
No, I've got it.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.042
Huh!

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:23.042
Oh, great!

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:25.292
This is suicide.

01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:28.417
Probably.

01:06:29.292 --> 01:06:32.750
Bring some water, Sasha.

01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:48.583
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:55.375
Sasha.

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:06.875
The great Cavaldi.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:12.167
Children in danger
and here he is, hiding out.

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.208
<i>Scusa.</i>

01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:24.458
Ah, poor birdie.

01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:33.792
Huh?

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:02.458
What is ha..?

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:15.917
- Cavaldi.
- Huh?

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:30.917
Sasha!

01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:33.582
Sasha, run to my voice.
Sasha, this way.

01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:39.042
Got you.

01:08:40.167 --> 01:08:42.354
Cavaldi.

01:08:42.389 --> 01:08:44.542
Get inside.

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.457
It will be fine.

01:09:06.832 --> 01:09:08.082
I...

01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:10.292
I do believe I've soiled myself.

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:13.125
Oh, good.
I thought it was me.

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:18.917
Hm. I taste good.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:20.957
Sasha!

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.957
Can't catch me,
I'm the gingerbread man. Ha ha!

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.667
- Sasha!
- Sasha!

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.750
And one...

01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:38.250
We're doing fine, Will.

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:46.667
That's good. Steady.

01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:52.292
Will! Come on,
keep it together down there.

01:09:52.332 --> 01:09:55.292
We're almost there.
Put some muscle into it.

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.917
Life without Jake.

01:09:56.958 --> 01:09:59.048
Will, concentrate.

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:01.292
Only a matter of seconds now.

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:05.042
That's good, Will.
Keep going.

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:32.083
Hah! Oh!

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:33.708
Oh.

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:36.375
Where was I? Oh, yes.

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:40.250
Settling down.
Honest labor.

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:53.333
Crypts. There's, uh...

01:10:53.368 --> 01:10:56.542
One, two, three, four.

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:58.875
Five, six.

01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:02.458
Seven, eight. Nine, ten.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:04.792
Eleven, twelve.

01:11:04.833 --> 01:11:06.875
Uh... Will!

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:11.042
Will, it's strange,
there's twelve crypts.

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:15.833
And they're evenly spaced in a circle.

01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:18.333
Yeah, it's like a clock face.

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:24.167
Easy. Easy.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
All right, Will.
I'm going in, Will.

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:30.167
He's going in.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.708
That was lucky.

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:03.625
It's...

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:07.000
What's this? It's a crown.

01:12:07.042 --> 01:12:09.167
It's a...

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:14.917
Oh!

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:29.750
It's a book of spells.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:48.500
Jake?

01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:51.500
It's a book of spells. Huh.

01:12:56.875 --> 01:12:59.500
That's the blood moon.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.625
Twelve crypts.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:08.833
Eleven girls.

01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:16.167
I'm new at this, darling.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:22.458
If I'm doing it wrong or if there's a certain
way you like it, Grandmother Toad...

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:26.250
I'll just try to be gentle.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:32.500
Now show me
the way back to Angelika's house.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.625
Make up your mind.

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:56.042
Sasha?

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.625
For you, my queen.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.083
Oh!

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:43.583
Sleep.

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:50.625
Jake.

01:15:50.667 --> 01:15:52.708
Oh.

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:11.208
Huh!

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.458
Ha! Will!

01:16:49.167 --> 01:16:51.167
Jacob.

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.833
What? Huh!

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:55.292
Jacob.

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:58.167
Look at me, Jacob.

01:17:03.542 --> 01:17:06.167
Look at me, Jacob.

01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:09.833
Am I still the fairest of them all?

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:15.958
Tell me I am the fairest of them all.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.250
Jacob.

01:17:18.292 --> 01:17:23.500
And I will make
your dreams come true.

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:27.917
I've got you, Sasha.

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:44.625
What do you desire, Jacob?

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:48.833
Fame?

01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:51.708
Power?

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:55.583
Angelika?

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.750
You love her,

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:03.000
not him.

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:07.833
He doesn't love her.

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:13.833
Not like you, Jacob.

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:15.833
Jake!

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.375
Jake!

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500
- Argh!
- Oh!

01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:28.625
Jacob Grimm, you bedwetting piss bucket!

01:18:32.417 --> 01:18:34.792
Ha ha!

01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:36.375
Look at me, Jacob.

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:38.708
No, no. Don't look at her.

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:43.042
Jacob. Jacob.
Look at me, Jacob. Jacob!

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:51.750
Rapunzel!

01:18:59.042 --> 01:19:01.917
Good timing. Nice disguise.

01:19:01.958 --> 01:19:05.708
She's still there, Will.
She's still alive. She's up in the tower.

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:09.250
- For 500 years?
- Yeah, but they haven't been kind.

01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:11.667
- Grab the ax.
- Huh? Right.

01:19:11.708 --> 01:19:14.375
They tricked her, Will.
They tricked her.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:18.583
Because she has the spell for eternal life,
but not for youth, not youth.

01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:22.792
So she'll rot for eternity, waiting for
someone to come and rescue her.

01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:25.667
- Come on.
- Was that Sasha?

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:28.000
- It's this way, Will.
- No, no, it's not.

01:19:28.042 --> 01:19:31.167
- It's that way. Grandmother Toad told me.
- What?

01:19:31.202 --> 01:19:34.042
Trust the toad!

01:19:34.077 --> 01:19:36.083
Come on!

01:19:36.833 --> 01:19:39.083
Stand aside, Will.

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:55.542
It's the ax, Will.
It's enchanted as well.

01:19:55.583 --> 01:19:57.625
Stop them!

01:19:57.667 --> 01:19:59.667
Jacob!

01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:09.375
To the horses. Run!

01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:22.167
Stop them!

01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:28.792
Sasha!

01:20:28.833 --> 01:20:31.500
Sasha! Sasha.

01:20:34.667 --> 01:20:36.215
She's not breathing.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:40.958
- How can she not be breathing?
- It's impossible. I saw her walk.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.333
There's no breath.
No pulse.

01:20:44.708 --> 01:20:47.708
- Sasha.
- Cursed forever!

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:53.375
They shall all perish
beneath the blood moon.

01:20:53.917 --> 01:20:56.417
The drawings. The spells.

01:20:56.458 --> 01:21:00.375
The blood moon comes tonight.

01:21:04.375 --> 01:21:07.500
It has to do with the eclipse.

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:09.542
It has to do with the eclipse.

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:13.333
Listen to me.
We know why your forest is enchanted.

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:17.465
It's under the power of
the Thuringian queen.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.500
She's stolen your girls for their youth,
for their beauty.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.292
She needs twelve.
Sasha was meant to be the twelfth.

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:26.000
The queen needs one more
to make her spell work.

01:21:26.042 --> 01:21:30.667
You're right. Clear out these children.
Get them to Malsburg or Frankfurt.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.958
Leave before the eclipse.

01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:39.667
Listen!

01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:05.250
People of Marbaden,

01:22:05.292 --> 01:22:07.500
citizens of France,

01:22:07.542 --> 01:22:14.333
all honor and glory be
to General Vavarin Delatombe.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.500
He rides to the aid of his people.

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:24.208
<i>Où est Cavaldi?</i>

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:27.125
<i>Generale! Generale!</i>

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:30.125
<i>Generale!</i>

01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:34.625
<i>Ecco Cavaldi!</i>

01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:43.875
What are you wearing?

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:46.208
Ah, this.

01:22:46.292 --> 01:22:48.792
Precautionary measure.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.715
<i>Generale.</i>

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:55.500
All is well. Everything is in the hands
of your most devoted...

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:57.833
Argh!

01:22:57.875 --> 01:22:59.590
If all is well,

01:22:59.625 --> 01:23:04.167
why were two compatriots of these men
arrested on the road to Malsburg?

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:09.792
And why would they not stop telling tales

01:23:09.833 --> 01:23:14.167
of extraordinary occurrences
in the Thuringian Forest,

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:18.542
spreading superstition and rumors
amongst my troops?

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:21.583
These Grimms are thieves and liars.

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:25.083
Every demon they have killed
they have created.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.625
- No, no, that's not true.
- That's a lie.

01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:29.917
But I have confessions.

01:23:35.167 --> 01:23:39.083
<i>- Arrest them.
- Baissez-le! Baissez-le!</i>

01:23:39.333 --> 01:23:40.792
<i>Vite. Vite!</i>

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.333
You see?
You German people,

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:52.125
what you think of as heroes.

01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:55.958
New citizens of France,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.750
vanquish your darkest fears.

01:23:59.292 --> 01:24:01.917
Burn the forest.

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:07.965
And with it...

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.500
the Brothers Grimm.

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:24.792
Adieu, Grimm.

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:28.083
And farewell to your tales.

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:31.000
They will not be remembered.

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:35.042
Burn them.

01:24:39.667 --> 01:24:42.583
I, uh, sorry.

01:24:45.833 --> 01:24:46.833
Bye.

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:08.917
Elsie! Elsie!

01:25:13.333 --> 01:25:15.583
- Jacob.
- Will.

01:25:16.167 --> 01:25:18.208
Fire.

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.708
Bingo.

01:25:43.542 --> 01:25:45.583
Will.

01:25:45.625 --> 01:25:47.458
Angelika!

01:25:49.708 --> 01:25:52.333
The feet. The feet.

01:25:58.375 --> 01:26:00.917
Where did you find this?
Where did you find it?

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:10.208
- Run, Jake.
- Wait. My book. My book!

01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:12.833
Forget the book, Jacob! Run!

01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:18.125
This is the life, eh, Cavaldi?

01:26:18.167 --> 01:26:21.042
To be victorious in the field,

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:23.917
with one's troops around you,

01:26:25.042 --> 01:26:28.333
enjoying a simple meal,

01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:31.042
a soldier's meal,

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:35.458
by firelight.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
Romantic, huh?

01:26:40.792 --> 01:26:43.042
Wait!

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.875
Father?

01:27:20.292 --> 01:27:22.500
Where have you been?

01:27:27.958 --> 01:27:30.708
Cold. So cold.

01:27:32.375 --> 01:27:36.542
Come to me, my frozen prince.

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:38.375
Be mine...

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:42.458
...now and forever...

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:46.042
...in love.

01:27:48.125 --> 01:27:50.917
- No!
- Angelika.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:58.875
- It's my father.
- Stop looking. He was trying to kill you.

01:27:58.917 --> 01:28:00.500
Jake!

01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:21.458
Angelika!

01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:29.208
Angelika.

01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:33.500
Angelika!

01:28:39.042 --> 01:28:41.208
Will, Angelika's the twelfth.

01:28:44.833 --> 01:28:47.083
The twelfth.

01:29:20.542 --> 01:29:22.750
What the devil?

01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:28.208
What kind of magic, huh?

01:29:29.083 --> 01:29:31.833
What tricks?

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:35.542
Where are you going?
Come back here!

01:29:35.792 --> 01:29:39.875
You, stand your ground.
That is an order!

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:42.542
I command you. You traitors!

01:29:45.667 --> 01:29:47.875
Come back here!

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.875
Argh!

01:29:52.833 --> 01:29:55.458
<i>Generale. Generale.</i>

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:58.167
<i>Grimmy. Miracolo!</i>

01:30:03.667 --> 01:30:05.917
How is this possible?

01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:13.542
Run, Will.

01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:35.167
Sleep well, princess.

01:31:08.667 --> 01:31:12.292
It's started, Will.
It's started.

01:31:14.042 --> 01:31:18.250
- Yes.
- The blood of the twelfth, my queen.

01:31:28.292 --> 01:31:30.792
Wake up, please.
Will, push!

01:31:30.833 --> 01:31:32.583
I am.

01:31:32.917 --> 01:31:36.083
Will, try the magic ax.
Try the ax!

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.250
Ha!

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Give me that.
Back, back!

01:31:51.167 --> 01:31:56.042
- I held the ax the same way you do.
- Concentrate on getting up in the tower.

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.458
I don't have time...

01:32:03.167 --> 01:32:05.708
- We found the missing girls.
- They're in the crypts.

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:08.792
I mean, they're in the crypts.

01:32:08.875 --> 01:32:11.833
Grimms, story time is over.

01:32:12.458 --> 01:32:16.750
- Execute them.
- No, no. That's who you want. Up there.

01:32:16.792 --> 01:32:19.167
I said execute them.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.958
<i>Generale.</i>

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.542
I wish to resign my...

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:46.500
Resignation accepted.

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:51.792
Italian never agrees with me.

01:32:53.417 --> 01:32:55.333
Mild indigestion.

01:32:57.167 --> 01:32:59.542
It will soon pass.

01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:07.583
Is this one of your tricks, Grimms, huh?

01:33:12.792 --> 01:33:15.000
- Run, Will.
- Jake?

01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:21.083
Be a soldier!

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:38.125
How dare you insult my general?

01:33:54.458 --> 01:33:57.333
Die, barbarian.

01:34:08.458 --> 01:34:11.125
Heagh!

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:25.292
Oh, wait. No. Oh!

01:34:31.667 --> 01:34:32.917
Huh!

01:34:33.542 --> 01:34:36.167
- Bingo.
- You killed my friends.

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:39.125
I only wish you had more.

01:34:40.583 --> 01:34:43.292
Still, there is always your brother, hm?

01:34:46.083 --> 01:34:48.333
Where is Jacob, by the way?

01:35:08.958 --> 01:35:10.875
Beg.

01:35:10.917 --> 01:35:12.708
Argh!

01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:14.875
No!

01:35:19.292 --> 01:35:21.667
I want you to beg.

01:35:25.292 --> 01:35:27.917
Oh, God, no, no.

01:35:27.958 --> 01:35:32.167
Brave general, don't kill me.

01:35:32.208 --> 01:35:34.000
Argh!

01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:44.167
All I wanted was a little order.

01:35:44.208 --> 01:35:47.833
A slice of quiche would be nice.

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:09.792
Soon we shall be one, my love.

01:36:21.292 --> 01:36:23.250
Ah!

01:36:23.292 --> 01:36:26.125
- Yes.
- My queen.

01:36:30.792 --> 01:36:32.542
Stop!

01:36:34.167 --> 01:36:35.792
- Huh!
- No.

01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:39.625
Finish the spell, my love.

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:50.500
Agh!

01:36:58.542 --> 01:37:01.125
Argh!

01:37:30.375 --> 01:37:32.542
Where am I?

01:37:40.625 --> 01:37:42.250
I'm exhausted.

01:37:42.292 --> 01:37:43.917
Stop her, Will.

01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:50.083
No. Not the knife, Will.
Not the knife!

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:06.125
She's got control of them.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.833
When the moon again becomes full,
so will I.

01:38:14.208 --> 01:38:20.708
And your kingdom will once again be mine.

01:38:30.708 --> 01:38:33.708
- You can stop her, Jake.
- I can't, Will.

01:38:38.833 --> 01:38:41.583
This is your world, Jake.
It's just you.

01:38:41.625 --> 01:38:44.292
- Finish the story.
- Yes!

01:38:44.333 --> 01:38:46.667
I don't know how.

01:38:49.125 --> 01:38:52.875
Am I beautiful?

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.083
I can't hold on.
I can't hold on.

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:02.208
Ah!

01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:05.875
Who's the fairest of them all now?

01:39:05.917 --> 01:39:08.542
- You can stop it, you know the story.
- No, I'm weak.

01:39:08.577 --> 01:39:10.583
- It's you. It's you.
- I can't.

01:39:16.458 --> 01:39:17.458
Oh!

01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:21.500
Will. Will!

01:39:27.542 --> 01:39:29.583
Will, Will.

01:39:31.708 --> 01:39:33.132
Argh!

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:35.375
I'm sorry.

01:39:36.292 --> 01:39:39.917
Come here. All right, now.
All right, Will.

01:39:39.952 --> 01:39:42.250
Um... OK.

01:39:42.292 --> 01:39:44.542
All right.

01:39:50.792 --> 01:39:54.042
Such brotherly love.

01:39:54.958 --> 01:39:58.500
- Such sacrifice.
- Will. Will.

01:39:58.542 --> 01:40:01.542
Don't look her in the eyes.
Don't look her in the eyes.

01:40:01.583 --> 01:40:05.417
- He's dying, Jacob.
- Leave him alone!

01:40:07.042 --> 01:40:09.250
Because of you.

01:40:10.958 --> 01:40:14.257
Can you save him?

01:40:14.292 --> 01:40:17.708
Do you have your magic beans?

01:40:20.833 --> 01:40:24.542
Because I do.

01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:48.458
What a beautiful bedtime story this will be.

01:40:49.083 --> 01:40:51.798
Did you not know, Jacob?

01:40:51.833 --> 01:40:57.333
Truth is much more terrible than fiction.

01:40:58.083 --> 01:40:59.417
Will.

01:41:00.792 --> 01:41:03.458
Do you want to live?

01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:08.458
No.

01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:10.583
No, my queen.

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.750
Oh, no. No, my queen.

01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:22.458
I am here.

01:41:31.542 --> 01:41:37.375
Complete the spell, my sweet new prince.

01:41:38.667 --> 01:41:44.292
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

01:41:47.208 --> 01:41:49.417
Say it.

01:41:49.458 --> 01:41:51.833
You are the fairest of them all.

01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:54.125
No! Don't kiss her!

01:42:09.333 --> 01:42:10.875
So cold.

01:42:14.333 --> 01:42:17.250
Look what you have done!

01:42:21.917 --> 01:42:24.500
Angelika?

01:42:25.583 --> 01:42:28.167
You killed my daughters!

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:30.917
- My queen.
- Stop him!

01:42:30.958 --> 01:42:33.667
- You must die!
- Stop him!

01:42:33.708 --> 01:42:36.208
No, Will. No!

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:37.958
Argh!

01:42:39.083 --> 01:42:41.500
Who is the fairest of them all?

01:42:43.083 --> 01:42:45.875
No!

01:42:51.417 --> 01:42:53.500
Grimmy.

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.750
Signor Grimmy.

01:42:56.708 --> 01:42:59.833
Please. No, please.

01:43:01.125 --> 01:43:03.917
Tell me what to do.

01:43:04.958 --> 01:43:07.292
Serve my queen.

01:43:08.208 --> 01:43:11.042
No. Grimmy?

01:43:14.792 --> 01:43:18.750
Demon queen, hear me.

01:43:20.042 --> 01:43:27.792
Swallow my curse from
the dark heart of my ancestors.

01:43:30.042 --> 01:43:32.167
<i>Maledetta.</i>

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:36.333
<i>Maledetta!</i>

01:44:28.292 --> 01:44:30.542
Hello!

01:44:33.167 --> 01:44:37.292
Can anybody hear me?

01:44:38.292 --> 01:44:40.375
Hello!

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.542
Hello.

01:44:55.375 --> 01:44:57.458
Jacob!

01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:03.292
Jacob, it is I, Cavaldi.

01:45:03.333 --> 01:45:05.250
Jacob.

01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:07.792
Where's Will?

01:45:08.667 --> 01:45:10.750
Will.

01:45:14.542 --> 01:45:17.625
Oh, God, Will.

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.708
No. God, no.

01:45:35.125 --> 01:45:37.125
Wait.

01:45:37.167 --> 01:45:40.417
I know this story,

01:45:40.458 --> 01:45:43.625
from my childhood.

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.125
There is still time, Jacob.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:49.083
Look.

01:45:49.125 --> 01:45:51.333
See? Hurry, Jacob.

01:45:51.375 --> 01:45:54.625
The spell can be broken with a kiss...

01:45:54.667 --> 01:45:58.917
- Yes, a kiss. A kiss, yes.
... of true love.

01:46:02.208 --> 01:46:07.042
Make sure, in your heart, true love.

01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:14.625
Or the kiss will be the kiss of death.

01:47:01.167 --> 01:47:03.500
Yes.

01:47:11.917 --> 01:47:14.917
- Eva!
- Heidi!

01:47:14.958 --> 01:47:16.375
Bingo!

01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:18.333
- Lily!
- Elsie!

01:47:18.417 --> 01:47:20.792
Angelika!

01:47:20.833 --> 01:47:23.833
<i>- Will.
- Hurry, bambini. Hurry.</i>

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:32.667
Will. Come on, it's over now.
You can get up.

01:47:32.708 --> 01:47:35.042
Will, the spell's broken.

01:47:35.375 --> 01:47:37.208
Will?

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:39.458
We did it.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.083
Will?

01:47:44.833 --> 01:47:45.917
Will.

01:47:45.958 --> 01:47:49.125
Perhaps another kiss.

01:47:54.250 --> 01:47:57.458
Not you.

01:47:58.458 --> 01:48:00.500
Hm?

01:48:03.208 --> 01:48:05.708
Maybe you should give it a try, Angelika.

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:26.375
I just had to know what that was like
before the story ended.

01:48:26.410 --> 01:48:26.875
Will!

01:48:41.583 --> 01:48:46.083
Good people of Marbaden,
you have nothing further to fear,

01:48:46.125 --> 01:48:49.542
because I and the Grimmies,

01:48:49.583 --> 01:48:55.167
we have destroyed the dark heart of evil.

01:48:55.202 --> 01:48:57.500
You are free!

01:48:57.542 --> 01:49:00.333
<i>Grazie! Musica!</i>

01:49:07.375 --> 01:49:11.208
I would like to keep this.
It saved my life.

01:49:11.243 --> 01:49:12.833
<i>- Of course.
- Grazie.</i>

01:49:12.875 --> 01:49:16.250
And this, you should be
more careful about this.

01:49:16.292 --> 01:49:20.500
- It's very good, but I think it'll...
- Is that mine?

01:49:29.333 --> 01:49:34.458
- Sorry I never believed in you.
- Well, I never believed in you either.

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.542
<i>So you are brothers.</i>

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:49.750
You're welcome here any time,
any time at all, Grimms. This is your home.

01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:55.542
- I thought you ended up with the girl.
- You see that?

01:49:55.583 --> 01:49:57.250
What? The sun?

01:49:57.292 --> 01:49:59.542
- The day's not over yet.
- Yeah, right!

01:50:04.417 --> 01:50:08.208
- Would you call this a turning point?
- I'd say we're on the verge.

01:50:08.292 --> 01:50:09.958
- Really?
- The verge, Will.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.833
That's fantastic.

01:50:11.875 --> 01:50:14.687
Cos I've been thinking
of an alternative career path.

01:50:14.722 --> 01:50:17.500
- One that uses all of our new expertise.
- Will.

01:50:17.542 --> 01:50:20.583
- I haven't sorted it yet...
- Will, this is the real world.

01:50:20.625 --> 01:50:23.583
We're men without a country,
we're enemies of the state,

01:50:23.625 --> 01:50:25.875
and worst of all we haven't a single bean.

01:50:25.917 --> 01:50:29.792
- It's a good name, though, isn't it?
- It's a damn good name.

01:50:29.827 --> 01:50:31.917
Let's dance. Come on.
