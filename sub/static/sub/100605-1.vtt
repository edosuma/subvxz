01:49.574 --> 01:52.778
Today we are going to pretend
to be trees.

01:53.045 --> 01:56.378
We're gonna be tall, wonderful,
green trees

01:56.380 --> 01:59.916
with really long branches
and lush leaves.

01:59.918 --> 02:01.486
So, if you'll stand up for me.

02:03.354 --> 02:04.923
[imitates wind blowing]

02:06.524 --> 02:08.392
What's that noise?
Can anybody hear it?

02:08.794 --> 02:11.494
- Wind.
- [gasps] Wind.

02:11.496 --> 02:13.866
[all imitate wind blowing]

02:17.368 --> 02:18.469
And then suddenly...

02:18.737 --> 02:21.840
- there's a storm.

02:30.949 --> 02:32.448
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.582
- [woman] Hey.
- Hi.

02:33.584 --> 02:34.552
How's the house hunting going?

02:35.788 --> 02:37.586
Yeah, uh, it's okay, I mean,
it's just been going on and on.

02:37.588 --> 02:38.955
Well, take my advice,
pounce now,

02:38.957 --> 02:40.157
market's going through the roof.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.793
Yeah, we're gonna drop and see
estate agents later, so...

02:42.795 --> 02:44.127
[woman] Well, don't get
left behind, Gemma.

02:44.129 --> 02:45.429
[chuckles]
Okay, bye.

03:00.779 --> 03:03.347
Who did that
to the poor baby birds?

03:03.982 --> 03:04.983
I don't know.

03:06.551 --> 03:07.953
Maybe it was a cuckoo.

03:08.519 --> 03:09.520
Why?

03:10.656 --> 03:11.957
Because it needed a nest.

03:12.624 --> 03:15.727
Why doesn't it just make
its own nest?

03:16.995 --> 03:20.364
Because that's nature,
that's just the way things are.

03:21.599 --> 03:24.335
I don't like the way things are.
They're terrible.

03:25.536 --> 03:28.805
Well...
it's only horrible sometimes.

03:28.807 --> 03:29.808
[woman] Molly.

03:31.509 --> 03:33.477

Come a little closer.

[chuckles]

03:51.129 --> 03:52.731
Nah-ah! Come on, Mr. Tree
wants to get to know you.

04:06.577 --> 04:07.946
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:09.147 --> 04:10.847
Mm. So, how am I
at the tree game?

04:10.849 --> 04:12.818
- Yeah, you're pretty mediocre.
- That's good.

04:13.551 --> 04:16.420
[sighs]
Sad little things.

04:16.954 --> 04:17.956
It's cruel.

04:19.124 --> 04:20.125

Hey, come on.
Show some respect.

04:43.048 --> 04:45.115
- Did you knock them down?
- No, I did not knock them down.

04:45.117 --> 04:46.783
I am a professional.
Come on. How dare you?

04:46.785 --> 04:48.752
- Professional weirdo.
- Yeah, but professional.

04:48.754 --> 04:51.587
Professional.
[continues chanting]

04:51.589 --> 04:53.790
[Tom] I'm gonna get
my own wheels one day.

04:53.792 --> 04:56.226
Just you wait, I'm gonna have,
like, a big, you know,

04:56.228 --> 04:57.694
muddy gardener's van.

04:57.696 --> 04:59.131
- [Gemma] Sounds delightful.
- [Tom] Yeah.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.465
Are you gonna change
your T-shirt?

05:01.934 --> 05:03.434
- What?
- Your T-shirt.

05:04.136 --> 05:05.268
- [Tom] Seriously?
- Yeah.

05:05.270 --> 05:06.705
- [Tom] Shit.
- [Gemma] You stink.

- [shop bell rings]
- [indistinct chatter]

05:29.161 --> 05:32.028
[Tom] Yo, seriously. Your mom,
she's the worst offender, too.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.163
[Gemma] She's hardly over there.

05:33.165 --> 05:34.130
[Tom] She's there all the time.

05:34.132 --> 05:35.865
[Gemma] Well, she came
with the apartment.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.769
- [Tom chuckles] Yeah.
- [footsteps approaching]

05:46.178 --> 05:47.179
Hello.

05:47.813 --> 05:48.814
We're just, um...

05:49.580 --> 05:50.947
- looking...
- Yeah.

05:50.949 --> 05:52.516
- ...for something...
- And you are?

05:52.918 --> 05:56.054
I'm Gemma.
This is my boyfriend, Tom.

05:57.055 --> 05:58.056
Hey, what's up?

05:59.291 --> 06:02.794
Gemma and Tom,
lovely to meet you.

06:04.162 --> 06:06.530
It's lovely to meet you too,
Martin.

06:08.233 --> 06:11.001
Yonder
is a wonderful development.

06:11.003 --> 06:13.136
Both tranquil and practical,

06:13.138 --> 06:15.707
it has all you'd need
and all you'd want.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.275
And as for the prices,

06:18.509 --> 06:20.677
it's no wonder these houses
are getting snapped up. [laughs]

06:20.679 --> 06:21.680
[Tom snickers]

06:23.348 --> 06:25.083
I know what you guys
are thinking.

06:26.051 --> 06:27.152
Suburbia.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.721
But there's more to Yonder than
what you see in these images.

06:31.723 --> 06:33.025
We've lovely people,

06:33.225 --> 06:35.827
all sorts of people
ready to move in.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.830
It's going to be
a diverse community.

06:39.297 --> 06:41.599
Something different,
a nice blend.

06:42.334 --> 06:43.769
Where's it located?

06:44.603 --> 06:45.604
Near enough.

06:47.005 --> 06:48.140
And far enough.

06:49.007 --> 06:50.642
Just the right distance.

06:51.109 --> 06:53.777
[gasps] We could
take a look if you like.

06:53.779 --> 06:55.614
- [Tom] Hmm.
- Do you have a vehicle?

06:56.081 --> 06:58.750
- Ah, shit. Unfortunately...
- Yes, we do, outside.

06:59.885 --> 07:02.287
Good. I'll get my keys.
You can follow me.

07:03.221 --> 07:04.122
[Tom sighs]

07:05.390 --> 07:09.127
We could arrange an appointment
at a later date if you'd prefer.

07:10.028 --> 07:11.861
But like I said, homes at Yonder

07:11.863 --> 07:13.765
may not be available
for much longer.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.666
- [Tom] All right.
- It's not exactly

07:16.668 --> 07:19.304
what we're looking for,
but, um...

07:20.005 --> 07:22.007
- I suppose it's...
- Worth a look?

07:24.109 --> 07:26.211
Good. We're all happy, then.

07:26.878 --> 07:27.913
[chuckles]

07:29.414 --> 07:31.181
[snickers]
Jesus.

07:31.183 --> 07:33.685
Martin, you are one strange
and persuasive motherfucker.

07:34.019 --> 07:34.951
- Oh.
- Ready.

07:34.953 --> 07:36.321
- [Tom] Yeah, ready, yeah.
- [Gemma] Ready.

Right out

Ah

Rudy

08:06.017 --> 08:09.621
A message to you, Rudy

08:10.388 --> 08:12.691
A message to you

[humming]

08:31.910 --> 08:34.246
Okay. Here we go.

08:44.990 --> 08:48.426
A message to you, Rudy

08:49.294 --> 08:51.429
A message to you

09:00.472 --> 09:02.874
You're growing older
Each day

09:04.910 --> 09:07.445
You want to think
Of your future

09:09.281 --> 09:11.347
Or you might
Wind up in jail...

- Okay.

09:15.854 --> 09:17.322
- Let's get this over with.

Number nine.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.151
[door closes]

09:48.453 --> 09:51.723
Many homes have the pretense
of being ideal.

09:52.057 --> 09:54.726
But these homes
really are ideal.

09:56.962 --> 09:57.963
Please go through.

10:03.935 --> 10:05.068
Toasty.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.404
- It's...
- [Tom] Yeah.

10:07.072 --> 10:08.073
Oh.

10:09.407 --> 10:12.811
The living room.
A room to live in.

10:13.812 --> 10:16.181
Memories will be made
in the ample spaces

10:16.514 --> 10:18.516
between these walls.
[chuckles]

10:20.051 --> 10:21.217
Come.

10:21.219 --> 10:22.087
[Tom snickers]

10:23.321 --> 10:24.587
- It's good, it's good.
- [Gemma chuckles]

10:24.589 --> 10:27.092
I love it.
I love the single hue.

10:36.835 --> 10:38.436
- A welcome tipple.
- [chuckles]

10:38.870 --> 10:40.939
- I'm... I'm driving.
- [Tom] Mm.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.277
- Perhaps a strawberry.
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm driving.

10:59.357 --> 11:00.525
Blue for a boy.

11:01.627 --> 11:03.128
You've got it all worked out.

11:04.095 --> 11:06.031
Number nine
is not a starter home.

11:07.165 --> 11:09.198
- This house is forever.
- [Tom] Hmm.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.303
A perfect environment
for a young family.

11:13.071 --> 11:14.306
Do you have children?

11:14.572 --> 11:16.041
[Gemma]
No. Not yet.

11:16.541 --> 11:17.976
[imitates Gemma]
No. Not yet.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.221
The master bedroom.

11:31.489 --> 11:32.490
[Tom] Yeah.

11:34.959 --> 11:36.828
[Martin] If you follow me
to the back garden.

11:37.462 --> 11:38.963
A haven of nature.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.249
It's good, it's nice here.

11:58.483 --> 11:59.584
- [Gemma] Yeah.
- If you wanna...

12:01.086 --> 12:02.520
live here, it's a lot of space.

12:12.330 --> 12:13.998
So, when're people due
to move in?

12:20.372 --> 12:21.373
[Tom] Huh?

12:23.609 --> 12:24.610
[Gemma] Martin?

12:26.211 --> 12:27.212
Martin?

12:34.185 --> 12:35.186
Hello?

12:37.021 --> 12:38.123
[Tom] Nope.

12:46.998 --> 12:48.266
- His car's gone.
- Huh?

12:49.702 --> 12:50.634
His car's gone.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.537
Good. Now,
let's get the fuck out of here.

12:57.409 --> 12:58.410
[car door opens]

13:00.545 --> 13:01.546
[car door closes]

13:04.482 --> 13:06.518
- Okie dokes.
- [car engine starts]

13:27.172 --> 13:28.173
Buh-bye.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.647
- That guy was so strange.
- Yeah.

13:35.547 --> 13:37.582
Wait. No, no, I don't think
this is the right way.

13:39.350 --> 13:40.717
Yeah, this is the way
we came in.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.086
[Tom] No, is it?

13:43.154 --> 13:44.155
[Gemma] Yeah.

13:50.195 --> 13:51.196
Wait.

13:51.596 --> 13:52.729
What? You think
it was back there?

13:52.731 --> 13:53.866
Yeah, I think it was back there.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.337
Let me just see
what's around here, though.

14:08.413 --> 14:09.514
[Tom] Number nine again.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.347
Did we just do
some kind of loop?

14:11.349 --> 14:12.250
[Gemma] What the fuck?

14:14.219 --> 14:16.488
Wait, did we...
Did we leave the door open?

14:20.726 --> 14:21.727
How've we just...

14:35.674 --> 14:36.742
You want me to drive?

14:38.777 --> 14:41.143
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah? You're good?

14:41.145 --> 14:43.381
'Cause I think we're literally
going in a circle.

14:50.221 --> 14:51.289
[Gemma] Tom.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.792
All right.

14:54.693 --> 14:55.694
Give me the wheel.

14:56.294 --> 14:57.295
What?

14:58.429 --> 15:00.231
What difference
is that gonna make?

15:00.866 --> 15:02.565
Okay. Come on. Give me a go.

15:02.567 --> 15:03.767
- [Gemma] You wanna go?
- Yeah.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.468
- You wanna go on the car?
- [Tom] Yeah.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.403
- What are you? Six?
- Yeah, I'm six.

15:07.405 --> 15:09.675
- Come on, just move over.
- [Gemma sighs]

15:11.109 --> 15:12.711
Fine. [grunts]

15:13.545 --> 15:16.114
[grunting]
I'll give you a go.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.516
A little go of the car.

15:20.318 --> 15:22.053
- [seatbelts fastens]
- Okay. Let's go.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.768
Do you have your phone?

15:36.200 --> 15:37.201
Yeah.

15:39.470 --> 15:40.403
[Tom] Anything?

15:40.405 --> 15:42.473
No, there's no coverage
on either of them.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.109
Great.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.220
- Tom.
- What?

15:56.655 --> 15:58.657
[Gemma]
Number fucking nine again.

16:03.328 --> 16:04.495
- Hmm.
- Fuck this.

16:07.365 --> 16:09.233
Ooh, you're not doing that
in my car.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.170
- I'm opening the window.
- [window opens]

16:13.237 --> 16:14.272
You're such a jerk.

16:15.206 --> 16:16.240
- One second, I'm stressed.
- [Gemma scoffs]

16:18.644 --> 16:19.510
[Tom inhales]

16:23.514 --> 16:25.851
- [window closes]
- Okay, let's go. Thank you.

16:29.187 --> 16:30.121
[chuckles]

16:35.226 --> 16:36.227
[Tom] Number nine.

16:37.195 --> 16:38.762
Why the fuck do we keep seeing
number nine?

16:38.764 --> 16:40.198
I haven't seen a single car.
There's nobody here.

16:41.566 --> 16:42.799
- [Gemma] If I see another row...
- [Tom] Okay, who the fuck...

16:42.801 --> 16:43.466
- ...of green houses...
- ...would live in this place?

16:43.468 --> 16:43.501
...I'm gonna lose my mind.

16:45.536 --> 16:45.570
[Tom] This shit is not possible,
okay?

16:46.805 --> 16:47.336
- It's not possible.

16:49.273 --> 16:51.675
[Gemma]
Tom, we have gone this way.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.509
- I have gone this way that's...
- [Tom] All right, no, no, just...

16:53.511 --> 16:55.378
- Just let me figure this out...

16:55.380 --> 16:56.512
[overlapping speech]

16:56.514 --> 16:57.981
[Gemma] Please,
can you just listen to me once

16:57.983 --> 16:58.884
I think we should take a left.

17:00.151 --> 17:01.283
- [Tom] I know what I'm doing.
- [Gemma] You've done this, like,

17:01.285 --> 17:02.418
- five or six times now.
- [Tom] I know what I'm doing.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.723
- I know what I'm doing.
- [overlapping speech echoes]

17:05.289 --> 17:07.693
[Gemma] It just goes on
and on and on.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.648
- [sputtering continues]
- [fuel indicator dings]

17:31.817 --> 17:32.785
It's empty.

17:34.318 --> 17:35.520
- Oh, my God.

18:02.948 --> 18:03.949

18:18.630 --> 18:21.734
[footsteps approaching]

18:27.538 --> 18:28.674
Let's go inside.

19:06.712 --> 19:07.713
No taste.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.665
[whispering]
I've never heard such silence.

19:29.601 --> 19:30.468
Well...

19:41.013 --> 19:42.014
Come here.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.918
All right.
Hold the base with your foot.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.925
Be careful.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.460
[Tom] Okay.

Well, what do you see?

20:31.029 --> 20:32.463
Tom, what do you see?

20:34.199 --> 20:36.534
Hey, maybe...
Maybe we should follow the sun.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.736
We'll...
We'll cut through gardens,

20:39.738 --> 20:41.907
we'll jump over fences, what...
Whatever it takes, all right?

20:42.841 --> 20:44.109
We're...
We're gonna get out of here.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.111
- Tom, there's a light.
- [panting] A light?

22:26.544 --> 22:27.545
There's a light.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.219
[both pant]

22:34.653 --> 22:35.952

[Tom panting]

23:02.781 --> 23:04.082
What the fuck?

23:13.125 --> 23:14.525

Come back!

23:57.969 --> 23:58.970
What have you done?

23:59.638 --> 24:01.073
I'm sending out a smoke signal.

Someone must be watching.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.576
[imitates Tom] There must be
someway out of here,

27:26.578 --> 27:28.011

[imitates Gemma's cry]

27:31.549 --> 27:33.082
[boy imitating Tom]
Yeah, well, maybe, Gemma,

27:33.084 --> 27:35.318
if you didn't say no to every
other goddamn house

27:35.320 --> 27:37.355
we looked at,
we wouldn't have ended up here.

27:37.555 --> 27:38.988
[imitates Gemma]
So, I'm to blame?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.890
How is this my fault, Tom?

27:40.892 --> 27:44.160
I'm sorry, Gem, it's just
this place is making me crazy.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.532
[imitates Gemma] The food here
makes me feel sick.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.376
Creepy little mutant.

27:59.612 --> 28:02.080
Measure me.
Measure me, measure me.

28:16.594 --> 28:18.063
Am I bigger today?

28:18.596 --> 28:20.532
Yes. You're bigger today.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.901
I grow fast as a dog.

28:23.401 --> 28:24.569
[Gemma] That's right.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.338
What is a dog?

28:27.072 --> 28:29.172
We already told you
what a dog is.

28:29.174 --> 28:32.877
- Woof, woof, woof!
- Yes. Woof, woof, woof, woof.

28:33.078 --> 28:38.016
[boy imitates barking]

28:49.127 --> 28:52.197
Are you overwhelmed again,
Mother?

28:53.064 --> 28:54.466
I am not your mother.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.501
Who is my mother?

28:58.303 --> 28:59.304
God knows.

29:00.271 --> 29:03.174
Dog knows. Dog knows.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.630
[Gemma] I don't know
why we do this.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.096
They never seem to come
when we're waiting

30:34.098 --> 30:35.467
to bash their brains out
with a pick.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.236
- It's futile.
- Yeah.

30:40.238 --> 30:41.805
Like putting an SOS on the roof

30:41.807 --> 30:43.642
when planes never seem
to pass, right?

30:46.144 --> 30:47.245
Yep.

30:57.656 --> 30:58.657
Watching.

31:00.258 --> 31:04.529
That boy is always watching.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.065
That's not a boy.

31:11.436 --> 31:12.403

Did you... Did you move the box?

33:10.923 --> 33:12.455
- Tell me.
- [Tom] Where're the roots?

33:12.457 --> 33:14.290
- [Gemma] Tom.
- Where's the subsoil?

33:14.292 --> 33:15.759
- Where's anything?
- [Gemma] It's gone.

33:15.761 --> 33:16.662
I was right here.

33:17.796 --> 33:18.631
I was standing right here.
I was looking at the road.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.264

Tom.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.767
- Stop!
- Gemma, please,

33:23.769 --> 33:25.236
just let me dig, okay?

- Yeah.

34:07.613 --> 34:08.614
Why?

34:10.949 --> 34:12.483
It's got to have a bottom.

34:14.252 --> 34:15.619
It's gotta... It's gotta lead

34:15.621 --> 34:16.822

- Where?

34:17.522 --> 34:18.523
I don't know.

34:21.259 --> 34:22.661
- Australia.

Oh, well, wait for me,
I'll come with you.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.285
No, you know what? We only
got the... the one spade.

35:54.720 --> 35:55.988
Well, I could use the pick.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.024

You will leave it there,

01:12:21.539 --> 01:12:22.941
- Tom.
- [Tom grunts]

01:12:23.809 --> 01:12:24.810
Shit.

01:12:32.918 --> 01:12:33.885
Please.

01:12:34.853 --> 01:12:37.089
Please, please, please.
You need to help us,

01:12:37.322 --> 01:12:39.091
'cause he's getting sicker
and sicker.

01:12:40.192 --> 01:12:41.827
Please, you can't leave him
this way.

01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:46.530
You know, maybe it's time
he was released.

01:13:36.782 --> 01:13:37.716
[lighter clicks]

01:14:03.975 --> 01:14:04.976
[exhales]

01:14:12.284 --> 01:14:13.285
Do you remember...

01:14:14.886 --> 01:14:15.887
the wind...

01:14:16.888 --> 01:14:17.823
Gemma?

01:14:19.357 --> 01:14:20.659
Before we got here.

01:14:23.829 --> 01:14:24.830
Yeah.

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:26.631
The wind was great.

01:14:28.133 --> 01:14:29.968
I never realized
how much I liked it.

01:14:51.123 --> 01:14:52.958
I'm glad that guy stood you up.

01:14:55.026 --> 01:14:57.129
You looked so glum.

01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:00.230
I didn't know if it was okay

01:15:00.232 --> 01:15:02.134
for me to go over
and, like, talk to you.

01:15:04.169 --> 01:15:06.271
You looked so glum, so cute.

01:15:07.939 --> 01:15:10.008
I can't even remember
what I said.

01:15:10.408 --> 01:15:12.978
You didn't say anything,
you just...

01:15:14.746 --> 01:15:15.847
stood next to me.

01:15:16.281 --> 01:15:17.349
Oh, shit.

01:15:18.783 --> 01:15:19.784
That's creepy.

01:15:25.757 --> 01:15:27.425
You told me I looked like
I needed a drink.

01:15:29.461 --> 01:15:31.029
- You did.
- [Tom] Mm-hmm.

01:15:32.731 --> 01:15:34.964
You said I looked like
I needed one too.

01:15:34.966 --> 01:15:35.967
[Tom] Mm.

01:15:38.203 --> 01:15:39.371
And then I can't...

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.242
I can't remember what happened
after that.

01:15:45.177 --> 01:15:46.178
I guess we drank.

01:15:47.012 --> 01:15:48.013
[Gemma] Yeah.

01:15:49.114 --> 01:15:50.115
We drank and...

01:15:51.183 --> 01:15:52.150
we drank.

01:15:57.989 --> 01:15:58.990
Tom.

01:16:04.863 --> 01:16:07.933
Tom... what happened then?

01:16:11.236 --> 01:16:12.237
Then I...

01:16:13.805 --> 01:16:15.106
I must have fallen over...

01:16:16.308 --> 01:16:18.810
and woken up on...
on your couch.

01:16:21.413 --> 01:16:24.182
The sun was in my eyes,
I couldn't see anything.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:26.851
I didn't know where I was.

01:16:32.557 --> 01:16:34.326
You looked like you came
out of the sun.

01:16:37.262 --> 01:16:38.964
I could just
see your silhouette.

01:16:41.132 --> 01:16:43.101
And then when I...
I finally saw you...

01:16:44.836 --> 01:16:46.137
I realized where I was.

01:16:48.506 --> 01:16:49.908
And then you spoke to me.

01:16:52.277 --> 01:16:53.278
[Gemma] What did I say?

01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:01.219
You asked me if I wanted
some scrambled eggs.

01:17:04.422 --> 01:17:05.423
And?

01:17:06.291 --> 01:17:07.292
And that was that.

01:17:13.365 --> 01:17:14.366
Yeah.

01:17:16.868 --> 01:17:17.869
That was that.

01:17:24.843 --> 01:17:26.444
I kinda felt like I was home...

01:17:31.483 --> 01:17:32.484
because of you.

01:17:37.255 --> 01:17:39.190
I'm... I'm home right now.

01:17:50.869 --> 01:17:51.870
Tom?

01:17:54.205 --> 01:17:55.206
Tom?

01:18:00.245 --> 01:18:01.246
Tom?

01:18:06.117 --> 01:18:07.252
Tom?

01:18:14.993 --> 01:18:17.262
[cries]

01:18:19.497 --> 01:18:20.498

01:19:47.318 --> 01:19:48.420

01:25:45.911 --> 01:25:47.045
What is this?

01:25:49.547 --> 01:25:51.049
What am I in this?

01:25:53.652 --> 01:25:54.920
[boy] You are a mother.

01:25:56.054 --> 01:25:58.322
- [Gemma] A mother?
- [boy] Yes.

01:25:59.091 --> 01:26:01.727
Someone who prepares her son
for the world.

01:26:03.762 --> 01:26:06.799
[Gemma] What does a mother
do then?

01:26:09.567 --> 01:26:10.568
[boy] She dies.

01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:14.572
You go to sleep now.

01:26:15.573 --> 01:26:16.775
Have a nice dream.

01:26:17.508 --> 01:26:18.877
All we wanted...

01:26:20.712 --> 01:26:22.413
- was a home.
- [boy scoffs]

01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:23.882
Silly Mother.

01:26:25.684 --> 01:26:26.685
You are home.

01:26:33.091 --> 01:26:35.426
[muffled]
I'm not your fucking mother.

01:26:36.527 --> 01:26:37.528
Pardon?

01:26:38.697 --> 01:26:39.798
I said...

01:26:40.933 --> 01:26:44.736
I am not your fucking mother.

01:26:54.079 --> 01:26:55.080
[sighs]

01:26:55.914 --> 01:26:56.915
Whatever.

01:27:07.826 --> 01:27:09.393

["007 Shanty Town"

01:28:47.259 --> 01:28:48.627
A shanty town

01:28:50.062 --> 01:28:52.028
Dem rude boys
Get a probation

01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:53.564
A shanty town...

[air hissing]

01:31:03.929 --> 01:31:07.866
I ask myself, should I put
My finger to the left?

01:31:09.234 --> 01:31:10.869
No

01:31:11.203 --> 01:31:15.006
I ask myself, should I put
My finger to the right?

01:31:16.341 --> 01:31:17.943
No

01:31:19.244 --> 01:31:21.845
Does it really matter
Where I put my finger?

01:31:21.847 --> 01:31:24.147
Someone else will come along
And move it

01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:25.984
And it's always
Been the same

01:31:27.319 --> 01:31:34.059
It's just a complicated

Should she part her hair

Should she part her hair
Upon the right, no

01:31:58.049 --> 01:31:59.949
I said
It really doesn't matter

01:31:59.951 --> 01:32:00.986
Where you part your hair

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.253
For someone else will come
Along and move it

Doesn't matter

01:32:42.127 --> 01:32:43.159
'Cause someone else will come
Along and move it

01:32:53.438 --> 01:33:00.345
Oh, it's just
A complicated game

01:33:03.181 --> 01:33:06.151
They wanted Tom
They wanted Joe

01:33:06.351 --> 01:33:10.220
To dress 'em up
And stick 'em out on show

01:33:10.222 --> 01:33:14.259
They were only arrows
In a very bad aim

01:33:16.161 --> 01:33:20.865

Put his world
on the right, no

I said
It doesn't really matter

01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:05.375
Where you put your world

01:34:05.377 --> 01:34:07.477
Someone will come along
and move it

01:34:07.479 --> 01:34:11.416

Been the same

01:34:14.919 --> 01:34:18.223
