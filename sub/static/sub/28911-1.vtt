02:21.809 --> 02:23.775
If somebody's in here,
you better come out now!

02:25.212 --> 02:26.445
Who's in here?

02:32.686 --> 02:33.752
Where are you?

02:42.062 --> 02:43.829
Come out!

02:59.914 --> 03:00.914
No, get out!

04:13.621 --> 04:14.587
Hey Robert.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.822
Listen, we need to talk.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.990
Lynn's attorney just called,

04:17.992 --> 04:20.024
and she's not budging
on the alimony,

04:20.027 --> 04:21.959
so we need to discuss
some other options

04:21.962 --> 04:24.730
and liquidation of any
assets under your name.

04:24.732 --> 04:28.300
Give me a call and we'll
figure out a plan, okay?

06:32.860 --> 06:33.860
Hey, ma.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.295
I hope you don't mind
me crashing for a bit.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.616
Okay.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.391
Yes!

08:28.509 --> 08:29.509
Cheers, Edna.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.593
Where the hell
did you come from?

08:58.539 --> 08:59.539
Hello?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.082
Hello there, Tommy.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.209
Where did you come from?

09:49.523 --> 09:50.655
Raccoons.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.791
Forgot about them, Tommy.

09:52.793 --> 09:53.825
I love this place.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.295
Put you over here with
your buddies, huh?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.136
Jesus.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.007
Y'all be cool.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.329
Goddammit!

12:47.701 --> 12:49.667
Sorry, doorbell
doesn't seem to work.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.640
You're not
supposed to be here.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.741
Neither are you.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.310
I want you to call
your mother right now

12:59.312 --> 13:00.945
and have her come pick you up.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.614
Why would I do that?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.917
Because I told you to,

13:05.919 --> 13:09.921
and you don't need
to see me like this.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.224
Well maybe you need me to.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.425
Maybe that's the only thing

13:14.427 --> 13:16.628
that will keep you from
destroying yourself.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.031
I already crossed
that bridge, Sammey.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.201
And I failed, okay.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.503
I don't want you to
be any part of this.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.473
I already crossed
that bridge too.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.643
I'm calling your mother.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.178
I'm not living with
that bitch anymore.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.446
Hey, don't you talk
about her like that.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.681
That's my job.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.683
I don't care how mad
you think you are.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.686
Sammey, I screwed up, okay?

13:41.688 --> 13:42.520
It was me.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.388
Someday you'll get it.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.455
I get it fine!

13:44.457 --> 13:47.425
I am 17, not seven!

13:48.328 --> 13:49.360
Sammey, you just,

13:52.299 --> 13:53.364
seeing me like this,

13:55.569 --> 13:56.935
it's just,

13:56.937 --> 13:58.169
you feeling sorry for me,

13:58.171 --> 13:59.771
it's just gonna
make you resent me.

14:00.774 --> 14:01.894
Okay, and I don't want that.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.711
You're too young to understand.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.747
When Lynn finds out you're here,

14:11.318 --> 14:13.084
she's gonna shit a brick.

14:13.086 --> 14:17.789
Well, I'm not leaving, so you
might as well quit bitching.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.494
I'm going to bed.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.337
So you're not gonna call Mom?

14:32.339 --> 14:33.605
No need to.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.007
She's not an idiot
like your father.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.290
Weird.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.343
Attic Dolls.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.412
Good morning.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.381
Good morning, Sammey.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.953
You dumped my booze?

16:28.955 --> 16:29.955
Don't get mad.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.692
Sammey, I know
you're trying to help,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.829
but uh, I really
need that to write.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.064
I've gotta get this book out.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.232
Attic Dolls?

16:43.937 --> 16:44.869
Have you seen my keys?

16:44.871 --> 16:46.337
Just eat something.

16:50.777 --> 16:51.809
There she is.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.049
Robert?

16:58.385 --> 16:59.385
Sammey?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.025
Hello?

17:15.335 --> 17:16.567
Really?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.536
Don't look at me.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.637
Gee Mom, I'm sorry
some of us don't just

17:20.640 --> 17:22.906
throw each other
away like garbage.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.142
Sammey.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.444
No, Dad, I am
nothing like her.

17:26.445 --> 17:27.979
So what is it?

17:27.981 --> 17:29.747
You just wanna stay here and
booze all day with your dad?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.650
I see where she gets
the judgmental thing from.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.751
I'm not judgmental.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.019
She's just a bitch.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.755
Sammey, that's enough.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.224
It's fine, I'm, I'm
used to being the bad cop.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.827
Sammey, I know this
was hard on you,

17:42.829 --> 17:45.363
but this is not the right
environment for you.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.498
Yeah, no, it's
way better for me

17:47.500 --> 17:48.332
to be around a cheating slut!

17:48.334 --> 17:49.334
Hey!

18:00.046 --> 18:01.512
Shit.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.882
You know, it's gonna take
everything that we have

18:04.884 --> 18:06.117
to get us out of debt

18:06.119 --> 18:08.252
and pay for Sammey's
college right now.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.555
Was that my doing?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.390
No, and that's what
I'm doing here, okay.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.591
I'm gonna make it right.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.927
Right, we've seen
how you do that.

18:15.929 --> 18:20.264
Look, Lynn, just let her
stay here a couple of days.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.266
Okay?

18:22.368 --> 18:24.368
She's on vacation anyway.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.370
I'll talk to her.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.606
She's been really upset.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.576
Don't talk to me like
I wouldn't know that.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.978
You're not even on
the wagon right now.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.379
I didn't know she
was showing up, okay,

18:35.381 --> 18:36.581
and she dumped out
everything I have,

18:36.583 --> 18:37.849
so you can relax on that.

18:37.851 --> 18:38.851
Yeah?

18:39.853 --> 18:42.587
Sammey also stopped
taking her medication.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.755
I didn't want her on
that anti-anxiety bullshit

18:44.757 --> 18:45.756
in the first place.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.592
Still, I think it's dangerous

18:47.594 --> 18:51.262
to leave the two of you alone
when you're both unstable.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.397
Thank you, Dr. Phil.

18:53.399 --> 18:57.135
Robert, I don't
think it's a good idea

18:57.137 --> 18:59.704
for either of you to stay here.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.740
The way your mother
died was so...

19:02.742 --> 19:05.243
It was an accident, okay?

19:05.245 --> 19:06.177
And we're both adults.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.212
Maybe her more than me.

19:08.214 --> 19:12.183
But we need this time
together, okay, Lynn?

19:12.185 --> 19:15.987
And I promise, I won't drink
a drop while she's here.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.957
You should probably make
that a promise for everyone.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.793
Planning on it.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.997
I need her home in two days,

19:25.999 --> 19:27.832
and I want her to
call me tomorrow.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.902
That's a deal.

19:30.904 --> 19:31.869
Is there anything else?

19:31.871 --> 19:32.937
Please be careful.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.112
I got that.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.048
Sticks a little bit.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.589
Bitch.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.832
Can I come in, Monkey?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.135
Not if you call me Monkey.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.003
You used to love it
when I called you Monkey.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.438
That was a long time ago.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.008
I don't know, you
still look pretty

20:11.010 --> 20:13.578
monkey-like to me with
your little monkey head.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.717
That was God awful and
I need you to stop it.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.291
Mom says you stopped
taking the pills.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.027
I feel better without them.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.429
You probably are

20:31.431 --> 20:34.332
and I think that was the
correct Monkey decision to make.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.603
I know.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.140
Look, no one ever told
me how to be a dad.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.711
I didn't exactly do the
greatest job teaching myself.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.849
I was always just a
better friend to you.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.420
What you really
needed was a real Pop.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.626
And I should've fixed
things when they mattered.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.698
Sammey, you know I love you.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.034
I have a problem, I know.

21:11.571 --> 21:12.703
I'm trying to fix it.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.608
Being around somebody
going through withdrawals

21:17.610 --> 21:21.078
is not a pretty sight,
it gets kinda hairy

21:21.080 --> 21:22.980
and I didn't want
you around that but,

21:22.982 --> 21:24.715
now that plan's screwed,

21:26.085 --> 21:28.119
I'm actually gonna have
to ask you for your help.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.423
With what?

21:32.425 --> 21:34.425
Well if you won't leave my
alone to stew in my own funk,

21:34.427 --> 21:37.528
I'm gonna need someone to help
me with coloring and shading.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.796
Seriously?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.464
But your mom wants you
back in a couple of days

21:40.466 --> 21:42.867
and it might take a little
longer than that but,

21:42.869 --> 21:44.302
you let me worry about that.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.606
Once we're finished here,
you gotta be a team player.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.928
You're gonna promise me you're
gonna do what she wants, OK?

21:51.878 --> 21:52.878
We have a deal?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.746
Tell me about Attic Dolls.

21:55.748 --> 22:00.751
Come on, let's go look.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.457
Come on.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.165
And I'm getting rid
of all this stuff,

22:14.167 --> 22:16.000
so please, feel
free to dig around.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.370
Alright.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.841
Sammey, I wanted to introduce
you to my new friends.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.645
That big guy there,
he's Matthew.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.046
And the little lady is Chia

22:29.949 --> 22:31.949
and that's my friend, Tommy.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.651
OK, that's a little creepy.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.721
Listen, not everybody can
stay cute forever, ya know?

22:37.857 --> 22:40.057
Well, I never thought
dolls were cute.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.492
Well, you better
help me make em cute.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.361
I don't wanna scare
away the kids.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.329
Did you play with them
when you were little?

22:45.331 --> 22:46.530
Oh hell no.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.898
I don't even know
where these came from.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.067
Ya know, it's funny,
earlier when I got here,

22:50.069 --> 22:53.104
little Tommy there,
I found him standing

22:53.106 --> 22:55.439
in the middle of the
hall just by himself

22:55.441 --> 22:57.174
like he got there on his own.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.476
Whatever dude.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.777
No, it's like he got
there all by himself.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.579
I'm serious, you keep
an eye on these three.

23:01.581 --> 23:05.383
I don't want em creeping up on
you in the dark of the night.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.185
God, you realize your
jokes are terrible, right?

23:09.655 --> 23:11.055
I gotta take this,
it's the publisher.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.323
Hold on, be right back.

23:14.627 --> 23:18.262
What's up, guys?

23:19.132 --> 23:21.799
Tommy, you don't look so bad.

23:23.603 --> 23:27.838
You, on the other hand,
didn't age so well.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.213
What's wrong with you, girl?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.448
You scared the shit outta me.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.682
Sorry, it doesn't
mean you gotta go

23:38.684 --> 23:40.384
tossing my dolls all around.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.352
What'd she ever do to you?

23:41.354 --> 23:43.354
I don't care what you say,

23:43.356 --> 23:45.222
those things give me the creeps.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.491
Well, I think
they're a good concept

23:47.493 --> 23:48.592
and we're rolling with it.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.927
So, the dolls stay.

23:49.929 --> 23:50.929
Get used to em.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.863
Fine.

23:52.865 --> 23:53.798
Now, I gotta get
ready for that meeting

23:53.800 --> 23:55.065
with the publisher and honestly,

23:55.067 --> 23:56.801
take anything you
want outta here.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.010
Nope.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.420
Fuckin' great.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.093
Coffee?

24:23.095 --> 24:23.928
You're the best.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.262
I found my keys.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.064
Okay, what about breakfast?

24:27.066 --> 24:28.899
I'll pick
something up later.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.701
Coffee is not breakfast.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.205
I'm gonna be at the
publisher's for a couple hours

24:34.207 --> 24:35.673
at these meetings.

24:35.675 --> 24:36.607
You gonna be OK to take
care of yourself, yeah?

24:36.609 --> 24:38.108
Might even make myself useful.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.076
That's the spirit.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.878
We need some light in here.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.448
What the hell is that?

24:45.318 --> 24:46.484
Don't know.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.559
Good morning, can I help you?

24:56.395 --> 24:57.728
I don't know.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.331
I'm looking for Edna.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.067
Are you a friend of hers?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.535
Yes.

25:04.537 --> 25:08.906
Well, my brother was a
patient of hers years ago.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.142
She's the only one that
could ever help him

25:13.779 --> 25:15.546
and he passed away recently.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.048
I'm so sorry to hear that.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.917
Do you know where
I can find Edna?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.152
I'm sorry to tell ya this,

25:22.154 --> 25:24.788
but she passed
away recently too.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.627
Oh dear.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.362
Let me get you inside.

25:31.364 --> 25:35.032
We can sit down
for a minute, OK?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.668
There you go.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.602
Thank you.

25:38.604 --> 25:39.604
Sure.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.177
I'm sorry.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.848
She was important to us.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.753
I wanted to tell her
about Henry in person.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.956
And Henry,

26:00.059 --> 26:01.559
that was your brother?

26:04.096 --> 26:05.096
What's your name?

26:06.465 --> 26:08.666
Margaret, dear, yours?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.969
I'm Sammey and my dad, Robert.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.637
Oh, you're Robert.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.339
That's me, Edna's son.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.142
Yes, she often spoke of you.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.410
The artist.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.778
That's right.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.914
Margaret, I am truly
sorry for your loss

26:23.916 --> 26:27.017
and to add the shocking
news on top of it

26:27.019 --> 26:29.386
but I was just on my
way out to a meeting.

26:29.388 --> 26:30.387
If there's anything
we can do for you,

26:30.389 --> 26:31.789
please just let us know.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.358
Oh, please don't
let me keep you.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.327
I'm sorry to disturb you.

26:36.329 --> 26:38.095
Oh no, it's completely fine.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.463
You're not
disturbing us at all.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.365
Yeah, why don't
you stay a while?

26:41.367 --> 26:42.299
I'm not doing anything.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.801
You can hang out for a bit.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.569
We're clearing out some of
my grandma's old things.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.638
You could see if it's
anything you wanna keep.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.974
Well, I don't wanna
intrude on the two of you.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.910
It's no intrusion, not at all.

26:52.912 --> 26:56.313
Sammey, why don't you make
some lemonade for Margaret

26:56.315 --> 26:58.315
and I'll be back in
a little bit, OK?

26:58.317 --> 26:59.550
You're very kind.

27:00.686 --> 27:03.120
I am very
sorry for your loss.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.455
And you too.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.024
Back in a flash.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.405
My dad wasn't
close to his mom so,

27:21.407 --> 27:23.774
I never really got to know Edna.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.043
May I ask how she helped
you brother, Henry?

27:27.146 --> 27:30.247
Well, do you know
that your grandmother

27:30.249 --> 27:33.751
spent her career helping folks

27:33.753 --> 27:36.186
with serious mental illnesses?

27:36.188 --> 27:38.188
I've heard a
little bit about it.

27:38.190 --> 27:42.760
My brother has dissociative
identity disorder.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.662
Is that multiple
personalities?

27:44.664 --> 27:45.896
Yes, that's right.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.933
He believed he was
possessed by demons.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.470
And he...

27:54.006 --> 27:55.339
He was like a monster,

27:56.409 --> 27:58.909
but then, Edna
worked with him and

28:00.312 --> 28:02.713
he was just Henry,

28:04.183 --> 28:06.784
the brother I knew
when we were kids.

28:06.786 --> 28:09.887
Well, it's nice to know
she was able to help him,

28:10.856 --> 28:12.423
make his life a little better.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.762
Ya know, there's some interesting
things upstairs as well.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.998
Let me go grab a box.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You won't believe
these dolls we found.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.903
Dolls?

28:25.905 --> 28:27.771
Yeah, these three
dolls up in the attic.

28:27.773 --> 28:30.441
They're pretty cool but we're
using them for a project.

28:30.443 --> 28:32.409
You should still
see them though.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.477
Stay right there.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.598
I guess my dad must've
moved em somewhere.

28:55.868 --> 28:56.868
Hello?

28:58.804 --> 29:02.740
Margaret?

29:02.742 --> 29:03.742
Margaret?

29:05.811 --> 29:06.811
You still here?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.105
Now that, I can do.

30:06.639 --> 30:07.639
Dad?

30:42.808 --> 30:43.907
Jesus Christ.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.978
Everything's fine,
everything's fine.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.982
Don't be a basic bitch.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.254
We're not afraid of ghosts.

30:57.256 --> 30:58.956
No ghosts, not real.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.773
Oh, so you're the
little punk that's been

31:16.775 --> 31:18.242
thumping around on the roof.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.913
There, see Sammey?

31:22.915 --> 31:23.915
No ghosts.

31:52.611 --> 31:53.611
Excuse me, Miss?

31:54.513 --> 31:55.746
Hey, hey, excuse me.

31:55.748 --> 31:56.748
Oh!

31:57.549 --> 31:58.582
Shit!

31:58.584 --> 31:59.750
Who the hell are you?

31:59.752 --> 32:01.218
I'm James.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.654
I did not mean to
scare you, I'm sorry.

32:03.656 --> 32:04.588
Damn, I'm sorry.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.822
I did not mean to smack you

32:05.824 --> 32:07.391
but what the hell
are you doing here?

32:07.393 --> 32:09.359
I do Edna's yard work.

32:09.361 --> 32:10.294
She around?

32:10.296 --> 32:12.029
Yeah, did no one get the memo?

32:13.198 --> 32:14.464
What do you mean?

32:14.466 --> 32:16.166
I'm sorry if you
guys were friends

32:16.168 --> 32:19.736
or hopefully not related
but, she bit the dust man.

32:20.773 --> 32:21.672
Seriously?

32:21.674 --> 32:22.674
Afraid so.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.342
Did not hear about that.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.077
Apparently no one did.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.211
Were you close?

32:28.213 --> 32:29.880
No, no, no, we weren't close.

32:29.882 --> 32:31.381
I've done her yard
work for the last

32:31.383 --> 32:33.350
three something years, but
I didn't know her very well.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.384
Me neither.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.619
She was my grandma.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.888
Damn, that blows, I'm sorry.

32:37.890 --> 32:40.023
Eh, life goes on
til it doesn't, right?

32:40.793 --> 32:42.025
Yeah.

32:42.027 --> 32:43.160
So you wanna smoke?

32:45.564 --> 32:47.664
I don't usually
smoke with strangers.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.666
Smacked by em?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.268
Not very often, no.

32:51.270 --> 32:52.636
My name's Sammey.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.171
And how old are you, Sammey?

32:55.174 --> 32:56.174
21.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.913
Sorry I hit you all
up in your face.

33:02.915 --> 33:04.414
It's all good.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.416
Was a good hit.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.819
Now that's a good hit.

33:08.821 --> 33:09.821
Yeah.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.157
I wish I knew Edna had
such a cool granddaughter.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.761
It's a good thing she's dead.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.162
Otherwise we would've never met.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.498
Wow, that's messed up.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.780
What are you going
to school for?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.168
I don't know yet.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.337
I'm only going to
make my mom happy,

33:27.339 --> 33:29.773
but I wanna be an
artist like my dad,

33:29.775 --> 33:31.241
even though his life sucks.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.743
Your dad's a artist?

33:32.745 --> 33:34.778
Why, you actually like art?

33:34.780 --> 33:38.015
Yeah, I actually
like art, smartass.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.282
Let me see what he does.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.386
Alright.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.856
Alright, so we
talking paint art?

33:45.858 --> 33:47.157
Drawing, what's he do?

33:47.159 --> 33:48.792
Eh, some of both.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.671
Is it weird staying
here after your grandma...

34:01.673 --> 34:03.507
Paled her head?

34:03.509 --> 34:04.509
Little bit.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.571
Still better than staying
with my mom though.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.746
Gingerbread Bears?

34:10.748 --> 34:12.916
Oh shit, I used
to love this book.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.150
Yeah?

34:14.152 --> 34:15.385
Yeah.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.520
Wanna see what
we're working on now?

34:16.522 --> 34:17.522
Yeah!

34:18.757 --> 34:20.290
Attic Dolls.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.425
That is so cool.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.897
When the hell
did he draw this?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.032
What do you mean?

34:29.034 --> 34:30.500
Nothing, I just didn't
know he had the time

34:30.502 --> 34:31.601
to finish this much.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.172
Can we read it?

34:35.974 --> 34:37.706
Go for it.

34:37.708 --> 34:38.909
Alright.

34:38.911 --> 34:41.078
The Attic Dolls
live up the stairs.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.045
You'll hear them laugh
and run up there.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.348
But when you go
upstairs to play,

34:45.350 --> 34:47.184
they'll be standing
still each day.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.654
If you turn your back on them,

34:50.656 --> 34:52.688
you'll hear them
run around again

34:52.690 --> 34:55.125
and if you get to see them move,

34:55.127 --> 34:56.860
that's when they'll
come for you.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.530
Shit, that's my dad.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.767
Um, we should probably, yeah.
- Absolutely.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.268
Wow, that's awful.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.209
Hey Dad.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.643
This is James.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.113
He came by to do some yardwork
for Grandma, go figure.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.481
Hey Mr. Holbrook.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.715
I'm sorry for your loss.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.584
I'm a big fan of
your books for kids.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.452
Must be a big fan of kids too

35:22.454 --> 35:24.788
seeing as how you're
hanging around 17 year olds.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.289
Dad.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.757
Sammey, being too young
to buy a pack of cigarettes

35:27.759 --> 35:30.127
is nothing to be ashamed
of, isn't that right, James?

35:30.129 --> 35:32.229
Oh my God, you
are such an ass!

35:41.573 --> 35:42.939
Um, Mr. Holbrook?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.509
You're still here?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.144
Uh yeah.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.446
Um, I just wanted to
see if maybe you'd

35:49.448 --> 35:51.615
still want the yard work done

35:51.617 --> 35:54.551
and Edna wanted the garage
and the deck painted as well.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.287
I was kinda counting on this
job to go on a trip next week.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.389
It's my last chance
to get up cash, so...

35:59.391 --> 36:03.326
Look son, I'm kind of in the
middle of a mess right now.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.895
No worry, I just
thought I'd ask 'cause

36:04.897 --> 36:06.563
I haven't seen my
family in a while.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.498
They live in Germany now and

36:08.500 --> 36:10.367
all my friends around
here moved away.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.903
So it's kinda just me.

36:12.905 --> 36:15.338
But sorry to bug you guys.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.940
Wait a minute.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.542
How long will it take you?

36:18.544 --> 36:21.144
Uh, couple days.

36:21.146 --> 36:22.146
100 bucks a day.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.882
How bout 60 a day
and you're hired.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.252
OK, yeah, that sounds great.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.820
Great and James,

36:31.690 --> 36:32.956
she's not an adult.

36:33.825 --> 36:34.958
Do you understand me?

36:36.261 --> 36:37.494
You got nothing to
worry about Mr. Holbrook.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.029
I am a responsible young man.

36:39.031 --> 36:42.032
Thanks to the lessons I
learned in your books.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.467
Great, now get outta here
before I chance my mind.

36:44.469 --> 36:47.103
Yes sir, I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.044
Oh my God, I need a drink.

36:58.650 --> 36:59.983
Don't be mad at me, Monkey.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.585
Don't be an ass to people.

37:03.989 --> 37:07.157
Sammey, you're still a
teenager and I am your father.

37:07.159 --> 37:10.627
Therefore, I am obligated by
law to be an ass sometimes.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.396
Whatever.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.432
What happened to
that lady earlier?

37:15.434 --> 37:16.666
Margaret?

37:16.668 --> 37:18.068
Mmhmm.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.269
Did you know that Grandma
treated her brother?

37:19.271 --> 37:20.503
No, I had no idea.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.173
Anyway, I went up
to show her the dolls

37:23.175 --> 37:25.442
but when I came back
down, she was gone.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.910
Where'd you put them anyway?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.078
What?

37:28.080 --> 37:29.479
The dolls, I
couldn't find them.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.947
I didn't move them.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.449
Well, they're not where
you had them earlier.

37:32.451 --> 37:37.520
What are you talking about?

37:39.725 --> 37:42.359
See that, they're right there.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.960
No but you...

37:43.962 --> 37:44.962
how could...

37:45.931 --> 37:47.530
they were not there
when I came up.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.636
Well, did anyone else
come up here today?

37:52.638 --> 37:54.037
No.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.905
Did Zac Efron
come upstairs today?

37:55.907 --> 37:57.274
Nobody's been up
here but you and me.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.342
They just, they weren't.

38:01.146 --> 38:02.078
You feelin' alright, honey?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.613
I'm not making this up!

38:03.615 --> 38:05.782
Fine, I believe you, but if
you're feeling a little foggy,

38:05.784 --> 38:07.417
it might be a withdrawal
from the medication.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.785
I understand.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.987
I'm not foggy
from withdrawal Dad.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.155
Quit projecting on me.

38:14.026 --> 38:16.359
I'm gonna go get some
sun before it goes down.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.792
Wait a minute.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.640
Okay.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.279
The Attic Dolls
live up the stairs.

39:43.281 --> 39:46.282
You'll hear them laugh
and run up there.

39:46.284 --> 39:49.819
But when you go
upstairs to play,

39:49.821 --> 39:52.088
they'll be standing
still each day.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.698
If you turn your back on them,

40:01.700 --> 40:03.466
you'll hear them
run around again.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.771
And if you get to see them move,

40:07.773 --> 40:11.508
that is when they'll
come for you.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.578
You can't hide from
the Attic Dolls.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.314
They'll watch you
from inside the walls.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.352
When you try to run from them,

40:22.354 --> 40:23.354
that's...

40:24.055 --> 40:27.223
Help me.

40:27.225 --> 40:30.059
You'll wish
you hadn't come to stay.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.962
When you look away, they play.

40:36.701 --> 40:37.834
Dad?

40:37.836 --> 40:38.836
Sammey?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.973
Sammey, I'm going to bed.

41:49.975 --> 41:50.975
Congrats.

43:00.779 --> 43:01.779
Dad?

43:13.325 --> 43:17.794
Dad!

43:21.066 --> 43:22.066
Dad?

43:28.540 --> 43:33.610
Dad!

43:47.058 --> 43:48.058
Dad?

43:58.003 --> 43:59.235
Calm down, what's wrong?

43:59.237 --> 43:59.902
Dad, I think
somebody broke in.

43:59.904 --> 44:01.137
I heard running.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.238
Honey, you heard me.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.473
I was looking for the breaker.

44:03.475 --> 44:04.273
No Dad, I swear, it
was something else.

44:04.275 --> 44:05.308
I heard it in the hall!

44:06.177 --> 44:07.410
What you heard was me, OK?

44:07.412 --> 44:09.278
Now calm down, we'll
go turn the lights on

44:09.280 --> 44:10.880
and go look.
- Dad, Dad, I'm not lying.

44:10.882 --> 44:11.848
It was something in...

44:11.850 --> 44:13.149
really?
- Come on.

44:13.151 --> 44:14.283
We can fix this.

44:17.589 --> 44:20.056
There, you see?

44:20.058 --> 44:21.257
All better.

44:21.259 --> 44:23.426
It is not all better, Dad.

44:23.428 --> 44:24.961
I keep hearing sounds
up in the attic.

44:24.963 --> 44:26.229
There's all these hiding places.

44:26.231 --> 44:27.597
I mean, some pervert
could be living here

44:27.599 --> 44:28.531
and we'd never know.

44:28.533 --> 44:30.600
Sammy, there's no pervert.

44:31.436 --> 44:32.436
There, you see?

44:33.938 --> 44:34.871
Alright, come on.

44:34.873 --> 44:36.472
Wait, where are we going?

44:36.474 --> 44:38.474
I'm gonna show you
that it's not bad.

44:38.476 --> 44:43.546
Okay?

44:45.283 --> 44:47.116
You can see there's
nobody up here.

44:48.219 --> 44:51.120
Maybe the perverted
raccoons on the roof.

44:51.122 --> 44:52.789
You think I'm
imagining things again.

44:52.791 --> 44:54.724
No, not at all.

44:54.726 --> 44:57.093
Look, you said
you saw a raccoon.

44:57.095 --> 44:59.095
Dad, it's not
just up here, OK?

44:59.097 --> 45:00.930
Those smaller doors, I
swear I've been seeing them

45:00.932 --> 45:02.098
shutting and moving.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.901
Crawl space doors.

45:04.903 --> 45:07.336
You know how tight those
spaces are in there?

45:08.940 --> 45:11.240
Oh and you want me to
go in there and look.

45:12.444 --> 45:13.444
Mmhmm.

45:14.713 --> 45:17.880
Ugh, you're tearing
me apart, Sammey.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.552
Be careful.

45:22.554 --> 45:23.554
Huh,

45:24.856 --> 45:27.090
careful is my middle name.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.793
No it's not.

45:30.795 --> 45:31.861
It's Arthur.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.099
Hold on.

45:36.134 --> 45:38.101
Dad!

45:40.672 --> 45:41.672
All clear.

45:44.008 --> 45:46.442
Grandma liked to fish?

45:46.444 --> 45:47.510
Oh no, I did.

45:48.613 --> 45:51.013
Made me think my old
man was still around.

45:51.015 --> 45:52.582
Speaking of the old man,

45:55.487 --> 45:57.320
I had a bunch of old
photos I put in there.

45:57.322 --> 45:58.654
You see em?

45:58.656 --> 45:59.589
The ones of your parents?

45:59.591 --> 46:01.524
Yeah, where'd you put em?

46:01.526 --> 46:02.759
I didn't put em anywhere.

46:02.761 --> 46:04.994
I saw them but I
didn't move them.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.929
Well if you didn't
move them, who did?

46:06.931 --> 46:08.998
Probably whoever
is hiding up there.

46:10.335 --> 46:12.335
OK Sammey, we have been
through every nook and cranny

46:12.337 --> 46:13.736
of this house.

46:13.738 --> 46:16.005
Well then I guess I'm
losing my shit, Dad.

46:17.342 --> 46:19.742
Look, I just don't wanna
talk about this any more, OK?

46:19.744 --> 46:23.079
If someone broke into our
house, stole the pictures,

46:23.081 --> 46:24.514
great, good luck to them.

46:24.516 --> 46:26.082
I hope they enjoy them.

46:26.084 --> 46:27.850
Right now, I'm just
gonna get some sleep.

46:28.887 --> 46:30.119
Goodnight Sammey.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.325
Got a meeting with the
sales team this morning,

47:09.327 --> 47:10.993
so I'm gonna be out for a while.

47:12.230 --> 47:14.096
Know how to feed
yourself and all that?

47:14.098 --> 47:14.964
I'm not a pet.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.332
I think I'll live.

47:16.334 --> 47:17.900
Oh wow, these are really nice.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.735
Thanks, I figured
I'd do some mock ups.

47:19.737 --> 47:21.237
Oh no, don't even bother.

47:21.239 --> 47:22.071
Yeah, you like the style?

47:22.073 --> 47:23.573
Yeah, just keep going.

47:23.575 --> 47:26.075
I'm almost to the end, so we
can knock this out real quick.

47:26.077 --> 47:29.212
And hey, no flirting
with Justin Bieber today.

47:29.214 --> 47:30.246
It's a work day.

47:30.248 --> 47:31.948
Go to your meetings, dork.

47:31.950 --> 47:32.950
I'm serious.

48:07.819 --> 48:10.319
What happened to your face?

48:18.763 --> 48:19.896
dummy, dummy.

48:47.992 --> 48:50.626
I need to get outta this house.

48:55.133 --> 48:56.666
You have to get
rid of those things!

48:56.668 --> 48:57.600
What things?

48:57.602 --> 48:59.335
The dolls, they're evil!

48:59.337 --> 49:00.836
What are you talking about?

49:00.838 --> 49:04.507
Your grandmother, she's the
one who made them that way.

49:04.509 --> 49:06.108
I don't understand.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.544
It all started with Henry.

49:12.417 --> 49:14.383
Henry had multiple
personalities.

49:16.187 --> 49:19.555
One was the soul of
a lost little boy.

49:20.758 --> 49:22.725
The other two were demons.

49:24.662 --> 49:26.762
Edna got the demons
to speak to her.

49:26.764 --> 49:31.434
They were using Henry's
body as a vessel

49:31.436 --> 49:34.370
where they could keep the
little boy's soul trapped

49:34.372 --> 49:37.206
and feel off his
terror and suffering.

49:38.576 --> 49:42.545
But no doctor or priest
could free Henry of these

49:42.547 --> 49:46.816
three entities until
one day when Edna

49:46.818 --> 49:49.185
tried a different approach.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.187
Henry,

49:51.723 --> 49:56.792
I want you to meet some
new friends of mine.

49:58.730 --> 50:00.162
Those are dolls.

50:00.164 --> 50:04.467
You're right but these
dolls are very special.

50:06.838 --> 50:10.806
They belonged to a group
of nuns in Latin America

50:10.808 --> 50:15.878
doing mission work for
victims of famines, genocide.

50:19.350 --> 50:24.420
Dolls had powers to absorb
the darkest energies

50:27.625 --> 50:29.692
and bring healing.

50:29.694 --> 50:33.262
Today, they're here to
lighten your darkness.

50:34.399 --> 50:37.666
These entities possess
you because there's a

50:37.668 --> 50:40.036
part of you that needs them.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.542
You don't need them
any more, Henry.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.978
These dolls will be
their vessel now.

50:51.115 --> 50:53.282
Let's move them out of you.

50:54.385 --> 50:55.751
We can start with the boy.

51:00.691 --> 51:02.491
Are you ready, Henry?

51:24.549 --> 51:26.248
Edna was wrong.

51:26.250 --> 51:29.351
Those demons were every
bit as real as the monsters

51:29.353 --> 51:31.987
who terrorized Henry as a child.

51:31.989 --> 51:35.658
She knew deep down that
those dolls carried

51:35.660 --> 51:39.428
something with them,
something dark from all the

51:39.430 --> 51:41.564
pain and horror they'd absorbed

51:42.700 --> 51:45.901
and she was too foolish
to just destroy them.

51:50.908 --> 51:51.908
No!

52:00.618 --> 52:03.319
As far as
the asylum was concerned,

52:03.321 --> 52:04.820
Edna cured Henry.

52:04.822 --> 52:08.691
He never showed signs of
his condition ever again.

52:10.061 --> 52:13.796
By now, Henry was so much
better, he could come home.

52:15.700 --> 52:18.134
Henry was close to
being back to normal,

52:18.136 --> 52:21.337
so what could would
it to upset him?

52:22.340 --> 52:25.541
He seemed to be
getting so much better.

52:26.744 --> 52:29.345
Until one night
when I was at work...

52:50.168 --> 52:53.969
Where are you?

52:58.943 --> 53:02.011
Stop, get out!

53:08.619 --> 53:09.619
Henry?

53:13.591 --> 53:15.991
Oh!

53:19.197 --> 53:20.763
They blamed Edna for taking away

53:20.765 --> 53:22.565
their vessel in this world.

53:24.135 --> 53:26.969
Henry took his own life
so they couldn't take over

53:26.971 --> 53:28.437
his body again.

53:28.439 --> 53:30.306
That's what the note said.

53:31.342 --> 53:33.375
And then they went
after your grandmother.

53:33.377 --> 53:35.644
I know it was them.

53:44.555 --> 53:48.324
You and your father are next
if you don't get rid of them.

53:48.326 --> 53:50.059
I'm sorry Margaret.

53:50.061 --> 53:51.727
This is all just sounding
a little too crazy.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.929
You have to burn them!

53:53.931 --> 53:55.664
And then you have
to get as far away

53:55.666 --> 53:57.333
from this place as possible.

53:57.335 --> 53:58.867
Do you understand?

53:58.869 --> 54:00.502
No, I don't think I do!

54:02.006 --> 54:04.940
Well then, there's nothing
I can do to help you.

54:07.144 --> 54:08.944
Margaret, wait.

54:08.946 --> 54:09.946
Margaret!

54:10.881 --> 54:12.147
Margaret, wait.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.486
What's going on, you alright?

54:17.488 --> 54:19.688
Um, no, not really.

54:19.690 --> 54:21.056
Why, what's up?

54:21.058 --> 54:23.559
This lady who knew my
grandma was just here.

54:23.561 --> 54:24.994
Who, Margaret?

54:26.097 --> 54:27.029
You know her?

54:27.031 --> 54:28.364
Yeah, she's bat shit crazy.

54:28.366 --> 54:29.298
Seriously?

54:29.300 --> 54:31.600
Yeah, she's a total nut job.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.269
Why, what'd she say to you?

54:33.271 --> 54:34.637
She talk to you about
her crazy brother?

54:34.639 --> 54:36.839
Yeah, said he had
multiple personalities.

54:38.276 --> 54:39.775
Look, don't listen to any
of what she says, alright?

54:39.777 --> 54:42.344
You just gotta shew her away.

54:42.346 --> 54:45.214
She kinda freaks me out
about something in the house.

54:45.216 --> 54:48.017
Think you could like,
come in for a minute?

54:48.786 --> 54:50.586
Yeah.

54:50.588 --> 54:51.588
Thanks.

55:00.665 --> 55:01.730
Come check this out.

55:11.309 --> 55:13.642
Is that one of the
dolls from the book?

55:13.644 --> 55:15.778
Yeah, it is one of the
little Attic Dolls.

55:15.780 --> 55:17.046
What are you doing
down here, man?

55:17.048 --> 55:19.248
Don't you live in the attic?

55:19.250 --> 55:20.149
Don't do that.

55:20.151 --> 55:21.151
Just...

55:21.919 --> 55:23.285
What's going on, Sammey?

55:24.121 --> 55:25.521
What'd Margaret say to you?

55:26.624 --> 55:29.825
OK, she told me the
dolls are possessed

55:29.827 --> 55:33.095
or cursed and I swear,
it's like every time

55:33.097 --> 55:35.998
I'm looking away,
they're up to something.

55:36.000 --> 55:36.932
Really?

55:36.934 --> 55:38.767
It was a really freaky story!

55:40.004 --> 55:43.539
OK so, what are you
trying to tell me,

55:43.541 --> 55:47.443
that the dolls are
alive like in the book?

55:48.546 --> 55:51.146
No, I just been
feeling a little off

55:51.148 --> 55:53.349
and she freaks me
out at a bad time.

55:53.351 --> 55:55.184
Well I think you've
got proof that she's nuts

55:55.186 --> 55:57.219
and you've got nothing
to be afraid of.

56:02.893 --> 56:05.094
I, on the other hand,
have to worry about

56:05.096 --> 56:06.628
your unstable father.

56:06.630 --> 56:07.796
He's not that unstable.

56:07.798 --> 56:09.298
Really?

56:09.300 --> 56:11.533
OK, we're both super unstable.

56:11.535 --> 56:13.569
But he's harmless.

56:13.571 --> 56:15.671
Yeah well, not if he
catches us like this.

56:15.673 --> 56:17.706
Look I'm gonna get going.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.441
I got some stuff I
gotta take care of.

56:19.443 --> 56:20.843
Visit me after?

56:20.845 --> 56:23.145
My Dad's not coming
back until later.

56:23.147 --> 56:25.748
Uh, I'll see.

56:26.617 --> 56:27.950
Watch out for those evil dolls.

56:27.952 --> 56:29.017
That's not funny.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.391
I'll come by after.

56:35.393 --> 56:36.393
Dope.

56:43.768 --> 56:46.568
Okay, let's leave you down here.

57:13.264 --> 57:14.396
Sammey?

57:14.398 --> 57:15.330
Sammey?

57:15.332 --> 57:16.398
What are you doing here?

57:18.769 --> 57:20.402
Checking in.

57:20.404 --> 57:22.805
Something came up and
I have to fly to Boston

57:22.807 --> 57:24.440
for a few days.

57:24.442 --> 57:25.442
Neat.

57:27.044 --> 57:29.445
Can I come in for a minute?

57:29.447 --> 57:30.879
Whatever makes you jolly.

57:33.350 --> 57:35.951
Wanna blame me for
everything, is that it Sammey?

57:35.953 --> 57:38.253
No Mom, no it's Dad's fault.

57:38.255 --> 57:40.589
He got so drunk
that you blacked out

57:40.591 --> 57:42.090
and fell on a dick or seven.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.227
We were already
separated, honey.

57:45.229 --> 57:46.229
Right.

57:49.667 --> 57:51.233
God, this place is creepy.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.236
I never liked it here.

57:54.238 --> 57:55.070
Yeah that's great, Mom.

57:55.072 --> 57:55.904
Is there anything else?

57:55.906 --> 57:57.506
Actually yes.

57:57.508 --> 57:59.308
I spoke with Dr. Miller.

57:59.310 --> 58:00.843
Here we go, OK.

58:00.845 --> 58:04.480
And he says it's dangerous
to stop taking your medicine

58:04.482 --> 58:05.547
cold turkey.

58:05.549 --> 58:06.982
Of course he does.

58:06.984 --> 58:08.784
That's where doctors
get all their money.

58:08.786 --> 58:12.254
Uh, no one is forcing you
to take the pills, honey,

58:12.256 --> 58:15.958
but it's safer for you to
ween yourself off of them.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.593
There are serious risks.

58:17.595 --> 58:19.094
This is so naive.

58:19.096 --> 58:21.363
Stop acting like your dad!

58:22.266 --> 58:23.565
This is serious!

58:25.135 --> 58:26.502
Where is your father?

58:26.504 --> 58:28.470
That's none of
your business really.

58:31.242 --> 58:36.311
Look, I know you love
your dad and you should.

58:37.414 --> 58:39.781
He's a good man,
a really good one.

58:40.985 --> 58:44.253
He just hasn't been
able to heal properly.

58:44.255 --> 58:47.055
Yeah, after the way you
treated him, what do you expect?

58:47.057 --> 58:48.824
That's not what
I mean, Sammey.

58:50.427 --> 58:55.297
Look, when your dad was
little, his dad left.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.567
Robert threw himself
into his drawings

58:58.569 --> 58:59.902
as a way to deal with it.

59:01.105 --> 59:04.206
Then his father died and
they never made amends.

59:05.042 --> 59:06.508
So your father has this big,

59:06.510 --> 59:09.244
empty spot inside
of him, Sammey.

59:11.115 --> 59:12.614
It's really hard on him.

59:14.985 --> 59:18.420
I tried to fill that
empty spot but I failed,

59:19.557 --> 59:23.191
so you have every
right to hate me.

59:24.295 --> 59:26.595
I never stopped
loving your father

59:26.597 --> 59:28.564
and I'm not gonna
hang him out to dry.

59:29.667 --> 59:31.567
But he needs to come
through before we can

59:31.569 --> 59:33.201
have that conversation.

59:35.306 --> 59:37.039
So what, you and
your greedy attorney

59:37.041 --> 59:38.307
will lay off of him?

59:39.577 --> 59:43.378
If he can help himself,
I will renegotiate

59:43.380 --> 59:44.479
all of the terms.

59:45.716 --> 59:47.215
And if you can help him,

59:48.752 --> 59:51.853
I fully support that
and I trust you.

59:52.790 --> 59:53.790
Really?

59:55.025 --> 59:57.626
Not only that, I just need
you to be there for him.

01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:01.630
I have to catch a flight.

01:00:04.468 --> 01:00:05.468
Please...

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:11.673
If you get sick or anything
please call me, OK,

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:12.808
please just...

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.810
Yes, OK.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:16.912
What Dr. Miller
said really scared me.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.582
Promise me?

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:21.584
I promise.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:23.753
Thank you.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.322
Tell your dad I came by.

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:00.822
You holding an ax
behind your back?

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.257
How'd you guess?

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.960
Wait a second, what are these?

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:06.928
Damn, so much for
my murder plans

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:10.799
So much for your
murder plans.

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:12.034
Come this way.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.215
What's wrong?

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.651
Uh, just,

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.422
maybe we should slow
down just a little bit.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:35.090
Still worried about my dad?

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:36.958
Well uh, yeah.

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.261
I told him I'd be respectful.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:43.031
He gave me this gig and
he might frown upon this.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.500
Maybe we could
hang out somewhere

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:47.135
a little less provocative.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.337
County fair just started.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:50.572
You like cotton candy?

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:52.607
More of a funnel cake gal.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:53.442
I've never had funnel cake.

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:54.943
You've never had it?

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:56.878
I grew up pretty sheltered.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.181
OK, we need to fix
your childhood right now.

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:00.348
I am down for that.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:01.950
Let's do it.

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:02.784
OK.

01:02:02.786 --> 01:02:04.252
Oh um, I need to change.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:07.022
You should probably
go downstairs.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.024
Yes ma'am.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:15.630
OK.

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:16.565
- Alright bye bye.
- OK.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:17.727
Alright, I'll be down here.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.477
The Attic Dolls
live up the stairs.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.346
You'll hear them laugh
and run up there.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.383
But when you go
upstairs to play,

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:44.252
they'll be standing
still each day.

01:03:45.756 --> 01:03:47.489
If you turn your back on them,

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:50.091
you'll hear them
run around again.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.829
And if you get to see them move,

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:57.566
that is when they'll
come for you.

01:03:57.568 --> 01:04:00.502
You can't hide from
the Attic Dolls.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:03.305
They'll watch you
from inside the walls.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.808
When you try to run from them,

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.744
that's when the real fun begins.

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:11.713
You'll wish you
hadn't come to stay.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.750
When you look away, they play.

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:22.258
James?

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:25.161
James?

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:33.069
James?

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:38.907
Oh my God James, what happened?

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:39.841
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:04:39.843 --> 01:04:41.877
James, James, look at me.

01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:42.879
James no.

01:04:43.847 --> 01:04:46.314
James, James,
James, James, James.

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:47.482
It's OK, shh.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:04:59.561
What do you want?

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.829
Leave me alone!

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:04.366
It's OK, just leave
me alone please!

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:07.802
Please, someone help!

01:05:07.804 --> 01:05:08.970
Dad, help me!

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.340
What do you want?

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:13.508
Leave me alone!

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.243
Dad, please just go!

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.582
Sammey, are you hurt?
Baby, what happened?

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:23.685
It was the dolls.

01:05:23.687 --> 01:05:25.453
What are you
talking about baby?

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:26.488
Did he attack you?

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.322
No, no, it wasn't me.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:28.323
I didn't do that.

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:29.691
I wouldn't do that.

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.192
Slow down.

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:32.994
Margaret came earlier and
she said they were cursed.

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:34.229
She told me they were
cursed and I saw one of them

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:37.699
come alive and she said
they killed your mom.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.301
I think he's dead.

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:41.169
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.138
This isn't real life
on your medication.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.372
I'm so sorry.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:45.974
I know what I
saw, it wasn't me!

01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:47.208
It was the dolls.

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:51.379
They're right out
there right now Dad!

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:53.748
It's OK, I don't wanna hear
any more stories about dolls

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:54.783
or anything.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.419
I need you to help
me with this alright?

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:58.920
I need you to go upstairs.

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:00.355
I need you to get cleaned
up and I need you to change

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:02.190
out of that dress
and bring it to me.

01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:04.025
We're going to burn it.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:05.226
What are you going to do?

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:06.428
Make it right.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:07.990
No one's gonna put
my child into prison.

01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:10.433
You understand me?

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.335
I can take care of this.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:14.169
You gonna trust me?

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.370
You can trust me Sammey.

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:16.738
Yes, yes.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.872
I trust you.

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:19.441
I need you to trust me.

01:06:19.443 --> 01:06:20.875
It's gonna be alright, baby.

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:22.310
It's gonna be alright.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.445
It's gonna be okay.

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:25.480
It's gonna be alright.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:29.184
Just go upstairs and get
cleaned up, sweetheart.

01:07:42.893 --> 01:07:44.926
None of this is your fault.

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:47.328
I need you to do this, OK?

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:49.464
I need to do this.

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:52.934
Alright now, let's go, let's go.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:14.322
Hey, it's Sammey.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:15.924
Leave a message if you're cool.

01:08:15.926 --> 01:08:18.059
Hey, I don't
know why neither of you are

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.127
picking up your phones,
but I missed my flight.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:22.096
I have to catch an early
one and you guys are

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.299
so much closer to
the airport, so...

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:36.444
Thank you ma'am, so much.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:38.645
Have a great night.

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:41.149
Five star rating's appreciated.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.819
Hello?

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:49.557
Hello?

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.328
It's me, I missed my flight.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.497
Don't be scared.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:00.636
Hello?

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:05.274
Hello?

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:09.109
Oh, nice.

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:13.215
Robert?

01:09:15.452 --> 01:09:16.452
Sammey?

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:24.192
Hello, hello?

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.272
Hey, it's Sammey.

01:09:37.274 --> 01:09:39.374
Leave a message if you're cool.

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:41.442
Well obviously
you guys aren't home

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.511
'cause you're not
taking my calls.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.779
By the way, I found a great tub,

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:48.783
so you guys might find me in
it 'cause I am so stressed

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:50.752
from missing my flight.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.921
Okay, see you guys, bye!

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:53.749
Good.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.233
What the fuck!

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:13.334
Robert!

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:15.503
Sammey, that's not funny!

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.317
Mommy.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:33.321
Sammey?

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:35.823
Sammey?

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.027
Mommy.

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:44.632
Let's play.

01:13:40.784 --> 01:13:42.417
Dad.

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:43.751
Dad.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.319
Dad!

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:46.321
Dad!

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:50.324
Dad.

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:51.526
It's OK baby,
we're gonna be OK.

01:13:51.528 --> 01:13:52.927
No Dad, I need
you to listen to me.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:53.761
What is it?

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.096
Please burn them.

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:55.897
Burn what?

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.198
The attic dolls.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.466
I need you to burn
them for me Daddy.

01:13:58.468 --> 01:13:59.734
Margaret's been
trying to tell me.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.035
She said that the only
way is to burn them

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:02.737
and Tommy's been
leaving us messages.

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:04.705
He's been writing
messages on the...

01:14:04.707 --> 01:14:07.108
OK, OK.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.110
Where are they?

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.578
I put one in the closet.

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:13.348
Stay right here.

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:18.487
Be careful.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:22.357
Dad?

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:27.229
Dad?

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:36.571
I got em, all three.

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:38.940
No, I only put one in there.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:40.943
What?

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:42.977
I only put one in there.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.648
Sammey, just open the door.

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:39.300
Thank you.

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:43.871
Sammey, I lied to you.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:50.945
Your grandmother wanted you in
her life more than anything.

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:53.814
I couldn't forgive her,
so I wouldn't allow it.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:55.283
And for that, I'm really sorry.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.987
Dad, ya know, whatever
happened between the two of you,

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:02.924
it'll never happen with us.

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.993
Promise?

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:06.995
Promise.

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:14.669
OK Monkey, get to
bed and get some rest.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:16.704
Night.

01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:17.772
Goodnight.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:36.123
The Attic
Dolls live up the stairs.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:38.426
You'll hear them laugh
and run up there.

01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:43.864
But when you go
upstairs to play,

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:46.033
they'll be standing
still each day.

01:16:48.037 --> 01:16:51.706
And if you turn
your back on them,

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.641
you'll hear them
run around again.

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:56.811
And if you get to see them move,

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:59.246
that's when they
will come for you.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.580
When you try to run from them,

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:35.783
that's when the real fun begins.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:37.852
Sammey?

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:38.854
Dad.

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:42.657
You can't hide
from the attic dolls.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:46.027
They'll watch you
from inside the walls.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:49.031
Dad!

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.565
Sammey.

01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.509
You'll wish
you hadn't come to stay.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:04.078
When you look away, they play.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:06.415
Dad?

01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:18.559
When you reach the story's end

01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:21.295
is when we get inside your head.

01:18:27.637 --> 01:18:28.637
Dad?

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:32.307
Sammey?

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:37.378
Sammey!

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.713
Dad!

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:44.686
Sam!

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:48.323
Sammey?

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:50.825
In here.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.126
Sammey.

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:53.794
In here.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:58.733
Oh Jesus, Lynn.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:14.950
Dad.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.620
Baby.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:03.030
Hello Robert.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:07.268
How you feeling today?

01:20:09.539 --> 01:20:11.205
How am I feeling?

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:15.876
How would you feel

01:20:15.878 --> 01:20:18.479
if you were falsely
convicted of murdering

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:20.114
your entire family?

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.783
Nobody believed me.

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:26.587
I'm convicted of being
criminally insane.

01:20:26.589 --> 01:20:28.222
How would you feel?

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:31.525
You still
don't remember anything

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.160
from that night?

01:20:33.162 --> 01:20:34.762
Best I could.

01:20:34.764 --> 01:20:37.264
Something got inside of me.

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:42.436
It wasn't me, I don't
remember a thing, I don't!

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.942
There's
someone here to see you, Robert.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.511
She says she knows you.

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:53.614
She thinks she can
help you remember.

01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:08.796
Do you remember her?

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:13.100
She suggested a new
form of therapy.

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:25.913
I'm here to help you, Robert.

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:42.096
This time, we're
going to destroy them.

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:45.266
No, you keep them away.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.535
You keep them away!

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:50.170
