WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:04.403
(monitor beeping steadily)

00:06.039 --> 00:08.007
(device beeping rhythmically)

00:08.009 --> 00:11.010
Count, please.
Set to ten times.

00:11.012 --> 00:13.612
30... 150...

00:13.614 --> 00:17.449
160.
Good, that's it.
Mark and cut.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.753
(beeping stops)

00:20.755 --> 00:23.355
So did I hear whispers
about, uh,

00:23.357 --> 00:25.591
You and charlie breaking up?

00:25.593 --> 00:28.594
Are you trying to rattle me?
'cause I am focusing on

00:28.596 --> 00:30.796
Whether or not
her breast cancer has spread.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.631
They're keeping it
professional at work.

00:32.633 --> 00:36.035
Oh, I'll take that as true.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.636
(beeping)

00:37.638 --> 00:40.072
160.
(beeping stops)

00:40.074 --> 00:41.273
Cautery and tonsil clamp.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.342
Okay, well...

00:43.344 --> 00:46.612
I respect that. (grunts)

00:46.614 --> 00:48.313
So he broke up with you?

00:48.315 --> 00:51.083
No.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.151
It wasn't that definitive.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.119
Oh.

00:57.490 --> 01:01.627
Good. Now,
to keep the lines clean,

01:01.629 --> 01:04.196
Just put your hand here,
pinch the other hand,

01:04.198 --> 01:06.065
And pinch, pull down...

01:06.067 --> 01:08.434
You can tug. It's strong.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.702
Okay. All done?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.805
Pinch and pull down.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.074
Is there anything else
I can get you, emilia?

01:15.076 --> 01:18.077
Uh, yeah, is there
any way you can get someone

01:18.079 --> 01:19.711
To fix my tv?

01:19.713 --> 01:23.182
Does she look like
a concierge?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.417
Dr. Reid, let's go.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.421
I'll see what I can do.

01:31.624 --> 01:34.460
What about this patient?
You got the pathology report?

01:34.462 --> 01:36.562
Mm-hmm.

01:36.564 --> 01:39.565
That's a modification
of s.B.R. Cancer grading, right?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.700
So nottingham 7
is a high score.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.202
Considering
the nottingham scale

01:43.204 --> 01:44.837
Only goes to 9,
I'd say so.

01:44.839 --> 01:48.107
Why wasn't this picked up
in earlier mammograms?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.742
Um, she hadn't had one
in a few years.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.812
(scoffs) wow, this woman
is in serious denial.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.380
Why is that?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.749
A 2.5 centimeter tumor
in the lower pole?

01:57.751 --> 01:59.318
If she takes a bath
or puts on a bra,

01:59.320 --> 02:00.352
She would have felt it.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.188
Perhaps she thought
it was benign tissue.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.356
Not at her age.

02:04.358 --> 02:07.259
And what age is that?
16? 75?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.760
Do you have to make
everything a test?

02:10.363 --> 02:13.365
Okay.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.667
See the relationship between
the stroma and the lobules.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.303
They're almost equal, which
means she's not producing milk.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.905
So she's menopausal.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.574
Clever girl.
So what's your recommendation?

02:22.576 --> 02:25.511
A t2 triple negative tumor
with a nottingham 7 grade--

02:25.513 --> 02:27.746
Has to come out fast,
as I'm sure you've told her.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.916
I didn't, but you just did.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.887
Dana...

02:34.889 --> 02:39.791
(types)
turns out wearing a white coat
doesn't make me immune.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.361
(sighs)

02:42.363 --> 02:44.563
(folder rustles)

02:45.798 --> 02:50.869
â™ª

02:52.639 --> 02:56.241
<i>(kate herzig)</i>
<i>â™ª you dare me to dance</i>
<i>(camera shutter clicking)</i>

02:56.243 --> 02:57.643
<i>â™ª you offer your hand</i>

02:57.645 --> 03:00.546
You're kind of young
for a hip implant, aren't you?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.381
Too old to dance...

03:02.383 --> 03:05.617
But just old enough to qualify
for the endura-hip.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.653
How's my star patient?
Joel!

03:07.655 --> 03:09.755
You made it.
(camera shutter continues
clicking)

03:09.757 --> 03:11.890
I did.
Uh, danny,
get a picture of me

03:11.892 --> 03:14.927
And the world's best
hip surgeon.
I'm just here for moral support.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.662
Get your butt over here.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.896
Yeah, go on. Go.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.798
Come on, come on...
Okay, I'm not dancing.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.466
Mm-hmm.
Mm.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.834
Mm-hmm.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.270
Blake, any idea when this
campaign is gonna launch?

03:25.272 --> 03:27.573
I doubt we'd be paying you
for an endorsement if f.D.A.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.375
And health canada approval
wasn't imminent.
(chuckles)

03:30.377 --> 03:33.679
Mm.
All right.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.648
Mm-hmm. (grunts)
(camera shutter continues
clicking)

03:36.650 --> 03:39.918
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did I dip you too low?
Oh, no. No, it's okay.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.387
It's a little achy lately.
It's just...

03:42.389 --> 03:43.822
Probably the flu, karl.
(chuckles)

03:43.824 --> 03:46.625
Honey, I'm karl.
Joel's the pretty one.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.994
Hi, karl.
Mm.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.763
This morning
she called me "jasper."

03:51.765 --> 03:53.365
That's her dog's name.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.566
How about when you're
done here,

03:54.568 --> 03:57.269
You swing by the hospital.
Let me, uh...

03:57.271 --> 03:58.470
Give you the once-over?

03:58.472 --> 03:59.638
Okay.
Okay?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.506
Yeah.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.709
Danny...
Take a picture of us.
(camera shutter clicking)

04:06.246 --> 04:07.779
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.648
But you don't know
what's gonna happen.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.916
No one does.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.684
What is it?
What's wrong?
What?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.253
What's the real problem?

04:14.255 --> 04:16.688
There isn't a problem.
Then let her do her job.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.924
I'm waiting for her.
No, you're complaining.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.559
You know what?
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.661
Dana, what the hell
is going on?

04:22.663 --> 04:27.332
(sighs)
I'm afraid of needles.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.671
(siren wailing in distance)

04:32.673 --> 04:35.874
Good range of motion.
Well, it's not gonna
get me back on stage,

04:35.876 --> 04:38.677
But, uh, I'll be happy
with climbing windows.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.046
Honey, you mean
climb the stairs.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.914
That's what I said.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.916
You should check his hearing.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.918
Well, the hip seems fine.
Um...

04:46.920 --> 04:49.655
Yeah.
I would just like
to get some imaging

04:49.657 --> 04:53.058
And take some blood,
just to rule out infection.
Okay.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.660
Um, take a seat for me.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.364
There is the tumor,

04:59.366 --> 05:02.301
And there are the tiny
radioactive seeds...
(exhales deeply)

05:02.303 --> 05:05.504
Kind of like laying down
a path of bread crumbs.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.339
(clatters)
okay, I've got
to get back to work.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.674
Um...
Here.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.409
A lot of patients
like to keep this.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.477
Do they?

05:12.479 --> 05:15.314
It reminds them
of who their enemy is.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.515
Hopefully, this will
lead your surgeon

05:16.517 --> 05:19.051
Straight to the tumor.
Okay, let's go.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.386
Who is your surgeon,
by the way?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.455
You are.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.795
Dana, I've only done
about 2 dozen lumpectomies.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.897
They were all under
your supervision.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.432
Now, dave rothbarts
at the general--

05:33.434 --> 05:34.800
He's the king
of oncoplastics.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.102
Actually, I am.
(sighs) yes.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.071
But you can hardly
do surgery on yourself.

05:39.073 --> 05:41.573
With you acting as my hands,
doing exactly what I say,

05:41.575 --> 05:42.674
I think I can.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.543
There are other surgeons.
Why me?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.545
Because I trained you,

05:46.547 --> 05:51.717
So I'll know I get
a clean cut and good margins.
Okay.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.586
Maybe with enough time
and preparation, I can--

05:54.588 --> 05:57.422
I booked the o.R. For Thursday.
You've got 48 hours.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.859
(button clicks)

06:07.767 --> 06:11.403
(siren wailing in distance)

06:11.405 --> 06:13.572
(horns honking in distance)

06:13.574 --> 06:16.074
Blake. (sighs)

06:16.076 --> 06:17.943
What are you doing here?

06:17.945 --> 06:20.112
Ever since I sold you
on the endura-hip,

06:20.114 --> 06:23.014
We never seem to find
the time to just hang out.

06:23.016 --> 06:27.419
And so I thought that
maybe... We could do dinner.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.755
You really shouldn't
be looking at those.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.490
I really shouldn't have
slept with you either,

06:31.492 --> 06:34.960
But I did,
and it was fun.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.396
Besides, paulina waived
her privacy rights

06:37.398 --> 06:39.698
When she signed on to do
the implant trial.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.068
And I don't see any signs
of loosening or early wear.

06:44.670 --> 06:48.473
Yeah, those femoral and
acetabular components seem fine.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.176
Yeah.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.178
Hey.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.882
<i>(woman on p.A.) code blue</i>
<i>to the coffee kiosk.</i>

06:56.884 --> 06:58.116
We--we were heading home.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.086
Then she just dropped.
Okay, okay.
Step back, charlie.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.455
Yeah.
I got this.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.891
(karl) can you tell me
what's going on?
Okay, ready?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.926
Do fore and aft.
Here we go.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.796
Okay, starting the first
cycle of compressions.

07:10.798 --> 07:14.733
When we get the crash cart.
No rushing, steady pace.
(gurney clacks)

07:14.735 --> 07:17.002
Let's go! Let's go!
(wheels clacking)

07:17.004 --> 07:19.204
<i>That's my life going away.</i>

07:19.206 --> 07:21.640
(sighs)

07:21.642 --> 07:23.475
Yes, it is.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.651
We gave her the full resus.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.187
Sorry, man.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.756
I was just dancing
with her.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.628
What happened?
That's what I wanna know.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.833
She's 40 years old.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.634
How could this have
happened?

07:51.704 --> 07:57.576
We all want answers, karl.
(joel) absolutely.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.078
That's why we need you
to consent to an autopsy.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.224
My hands are cold.
I want to warm them.
(blows raspberry)

08:12.226 --> 08:13.725
Okay. I'm gonna
touch you now.
Mm-hmm.

08:13.727 --> 08:18.263
I like to tell my patients
in advance.
(inhales deeply)

08:18.265 --> 08:21.500
Just relax.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.268
Oh, hmm.
What?

08:23.270 --> 08:27.072
That's a large mass.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.240
Am I squeezing too hard?

08:28.242 --> 08:30.141
No male doctor
would ever ask me that.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.577
You make being considerate
sound unprofessional.

08:32.579 --> 08:36.848
Not on the patient.
(sighs) the tumor
<i>is</i> part of the patient.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.750
All done.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.955
I want to thank you
for having such faith in me.

08:43.957 --> 08:48.560
Never thank anyone for what
you got by your own talent.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.629
Wow. Using a compliment
to criticize--

08:50.631 --> 08:52.797
I didn't think
it could be done.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.132
Okay, I'd like
to get an m.R.I.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.233
(scoffs) waste of money.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.701
I've had
more than enough imaging.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.103
Well, I don't want
any surprises

08:58.105 --> 08:59.838
That might affect
your oncological management,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.007
Or your reconstructive plan.
So...
(pen clicks)

09:02.009 --> 09:05.777
What's that?
A standard
surgical consent form.

09:09.181 --> 09:12.017
(clacks)
satisfied?

09:12.019 --> 09:15.720
Dana...
That's where I sign.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.922
You sign for the patient.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.897
(clatters)

09:25.899 --> 09:28.934
Thank you.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.913
(thuds)

09:47.653 --> 09:48.920
(clacks)

09:48.922 --> 09:50.221
(clattering)

09:50.223 --> 09:51.723
(sighs)

09:54.293 --> 09:59.097
(whispers) this one. Okay.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.103
Oh, great. You just ruined
a sterile tray.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.707
Sorry. I have
choreographed every move.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.975
My instruments need
to be lined up

10:09.977 --> 10:11.610
In exactly this way.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.712
Alex, look, I--

10:13.714 --> 10:15.880
I know you're going through
some stuff with charlie,

10:15.882 --> 10:18.149
But I know how to lay out
a lumpectomy tray.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.186
This has to be perfect.
And it will be...

10:21.188 --> 10:22.887
On the day.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.389
When exactly
is the surgery?

10:24.391 --> 10:27.993
11:00 a.M. Thursday.
Not in here, I mean,

10:27.995 --> 10:29.828
Kinney has it booked
for some mystery guest.
(cell phone buzzes)

10:29.830 --> 10:34.199
Who broke his nose
on his girlfriend's shoul--
dr. Reid.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.701
What?! That's not
her call to make.

10:39.271 --> 10:41.406
If alex is operating
in here,

10:41.408 --> 10:42.907
Then what's dana doing?

10:44.944 --> 10:46.011
Aren't they supposed
to be here

10:46.013 --> 10:47.679
Every morning at 10:00 a.M.?
Mm-hmm.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.414
Can you make sure that's
gonna happen for me?

10:49.416 --> 10:52.183
Okay, good.
Thank you very much.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.352
So you canceled
your blood tests?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.756
There's zero indication
for b.R.C.A. Gene testing.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.124
If I order a test,
I order it

10:59.126 --> 11:00.692
Because I think
it's clinically relevant.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.961
How? I'm not
of ashkenazi descent.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.764
I know the criteria.
I don't have any first
or second degree relatives

11:05.766 --> 11:07.666
With breast or ovarian cancer.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.267
Didn't you say your mother
was spanish?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.669
From galicia.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.038
Okay, well, there is
a founder c211a mutation

11:13.040 --> 11:15.373
That is associated with--
okay.

11:15.375 --> 11:19.144
There's diligent, and then
there's just plain officious.

11:19.146 --> 11:24.349
I don't need any more tests.
Stop wasting hospital money.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.986
Hey, um, there's still
no sign of the tv guy.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.788
I'll call him.

11:31.824 --> 11:36.261
Oh, for god's sake.
You are a <i>surgeon.</i>

11:36.263 --> 11:37.762
Act like one.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.800
(sighs)

11:45.037 --> 11:47.005
(siren wailing in distance)
hey.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.307
How did the celebrity
photo shoot go?

11:49.309 --> 11:52.077
Paulina durrell--
yeah.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.145
The ballerina who was
part of it--

11:54.147 --> 11:56.281
She was the code blue.
She didn't make it.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.816
What? That's horrible.
What happened?

11:57.818 --> 12:01.419
I have absolutely
no idea.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.756
You know, I should go
to the cut now.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.925
Let's talk about something else.
How was your day?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.293
Mm.
Oy.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.360
I'm a little nervous
about a lumpectomy

12:09.362 --> 12:11.296
That I'm doing on Thursday.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.733
Isn't it?
Yes, but this
particular patient

12:14.735 --> 12:17.268
Is a very controlling,
intimidating type.

12:17.270 --> 12:21.172
Well, um... Talk to dana.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.874
She's pretty good
with tough patients.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.452
Hey.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.287
Thanks for coming, man.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.090
Yeah, well, I know what
it's like to lose a patient.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.992
What can I do?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.828
I really need another
set of eyes on this.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.264
Hello, blake.
What you doing here?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.766
Are you worried about
litigation?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.434
I see you haven't lost
your cynicism, charlie.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.403
Yeah, any, uh,
findings on cause?

12:52.405 --> 12:56.875
I believe the scientific term
for this is "whoa, mama."

12:56.877 --> 12:58.109
That's a crazy big heart.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.477
Yeah, the autopsy report
will indicate

12:59.479 --> 13:01.780
Intrinsic cardiomyopathy.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.315
And sectioning of the brain
revealed neurodegeneration

13:04.317 --> 13:06.551
At a much higher rate
than I'd expect for her age.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.186
Now when you were
with her earlier,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.954
Did she exhibit any
neurological symptoms?

13:09.956 --> 13:13.024
Uh, fatigue
and an odd kind of aphasia.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.459
Uh, she would mix up nouns.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.828
Okay, any common denominator
between brain and heart?

13:16.830 --> 13:19.297
What would you expect
the cobalt ion content

13:19.299 --> 13:23.835
Mm, I'm guessing maybe
1 or 2 micrograms per liter?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.136
Right, well,
this poor woman's

13:25.138 --> 13:27.172
Was higher by
a factor of 6,000.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.107
Suggesting the hip implant
killed her?

13:29.109 --> 13:31.042
That's a big leap, charlie.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.211
Actually, I'm not
suggesting that at all.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.880
Stating a fact.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.882
This is what we suctioned
out of the capsule.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.819
Metallosis.
Right.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.287
And, uh, it didn't
show up on the x-ray,

13:42.289 --> 13:43.488
But, um...

13:46.059 --> 13:48.560
Down there on
the left-hand side of that?

13:48.562 --> 13:51.029
A flaw
in the forging process?

13:51.031 --> 13:54.165
Metal broke down...
Got into her bloodstream,
and it poisoned her.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.034
That is exactly
what I was thinking.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.102
Well, that's one theory.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.171
I'm sure the metallurgists
will have one,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.507
And the hematologists,
yet another.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.409
There's nothing simple
about putting foreign objects

14:04.411 --> 14:06.311
In the human body.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.579
So instead of jumping
to conclusions,

14:07.581 --> 14:10.515
How about we get this right?

14:12.219 --> 14:16.387
First, I will transect
the terminal ducts

14:16.389 --> 14:18.122
And separate
the nipple areola complex

14:18.124 --> 14:19.858
From the underlying tissue.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.292
With what margin
of normal tissue?

14:21.294 --> 14:22.927
1 centimeter.
You're certain?

14:22.929 --> 14:25.063
If I can do it
in .5, I will.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.265
But maintaining the integrity
of the vascular supply

14:27.267 --> 14:30.235
Is my priority.
And how do you
excise the parenchyma?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.904
In a fusiform pattern
towards the n.A.C.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.939
And then?
Then I close.

14:34.941 --> 14:38.109
What about the hemoclips?
Oh! Right!

14:38.111 --> 14:40.211
If we don't put the hemoclips
on dana's pectoralis

14:40.213 --> 14:42.547
And lateral edges, there'll be
no guidance for radiation.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.282
Dana, you're talking
about yourself

14:44.284 --> 14:45.884
In the third person now.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.418
Okay, that's it.
We're done here.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.354
(sighs) you are such
a great surgeon,

14:49.356 --> 14:51.155
But you are
the world's worst patient.

14:51.157 --> 14:55.560
Stop taking it out
on everyone.
You're fired. Go away.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.896
Listen, I know that
you're worried.
I am not worried.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.164
I am angry because
you are not up to the job.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.166
(thuds)
you're not angry,
you're scared.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.468
You know what?
That's why charlie left you.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.303
Really? What was
your husband's excuse?

15:07.907 --> 15:10.008
Oh, you are so fired.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.983
This tumor is not going away
because you say so, dana,

15:18.985 --> 15:20.985
And neither am I.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.326
(paper hits floor)

15:28.328 --> 15:29.661
You know,
when sabian medical

15:29.663 --> 15:33.031
Asked me to participate
in the clinical trials...

15:33.033 --> 15:35.266
I jumped.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.235
I thought, finally we'll have
a hip implant

15:37.237 --> 15:38.369
That never needs replacing.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.438
(pen clicks)

15:40.440 --> 15:43.041
This is the result.
Well, don't beat yourself up.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.176
Everyone wants to believe
in the miracle.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.945
Well, you were smart enough
not to get involved.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.980
(chuckles) yeah.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.683
That's only 'cause I got burned
on the last miracle implant.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.456
(drawer clatters)
how about a drink?

15:58.458 --> 16:02.427
Um... (sighs) I really have
to take this to pathology.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.163
Actually,
that's going with me.

16:05.165 --> 16:09.000
You know the terms
of our clinical trial--

16:09.002 --> 16:10.735
Any implant removed
from participants

16:10.737 --> 16:13.438
Becomes the sole property
of sabian medical devices.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.739
What, is that the only reason

16:14.741 --> 16:16.607
That you wanted to conduct
the autopsy--

16:16.609 --> 16:18.977
Just to get your prosthesis?
(sighs)

16:18.979 --> 16:21.346
If there is a design flaw here,
I want to know about it,

16:21.348 --> 16:22.580
And I want to get it fixed.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.049
Yeah, we all do.
(chuckles) okay.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.684
But let's get some
perspective here.

16:26.686 --> 16:32.223
Just one failure out
of 3,000 implants to date.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.159
That's less than
any prosthesis on the market.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.043
(engine turns off)

16:55.080 --> 16:56.681
(dog barks in distance)

16:58.517 --> 17:01.319
(doorbell rings)

17:04.456 --> 17:07.025
Uh, mom, alex is here!

17:07.027 --> 17:09.560
Molly... I'm surprised
you remember me.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.396
Yeah.
Hey.

17:11.398 --> 17:15.666
Um, I'm at sherri's until 11:00
studying french.

17:15.668 --> 17:19.404
Studying or meeting jason?
'cause I don't see a textbook.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.439
<i>C'est ici, ma belle mÃ¨re.</i>

17:21.441 --> 17:22.707
Good, well, study hard,
because you just called me

17:22.709 --> 17:24.475
Your "mother-in-law."
(groans) oh.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.543
It's <i>"trÃ¨s belle mre."</i>

17:25.545 --> 17:27.745
Yes, love you.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.348
How are you getting home?
Sherri's mom.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.216
God, if that skirt
were any shorter,

17:32.218 --> 17:34.752
It would be a scarf.
I had hem inspection
every morning.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.220
So did I.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.755
Sister valenciaga
with a ruler.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.225
2 1/2 inches
above the knee, max.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.062
You're still fired,
by the way.
I'd quit if I wasn't.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.065
I'm making
carrot and coriander soup.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.635
Or leek and potato,
courgette and mint.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.537
Yes. (sighs) I know.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.272
I've been cooking.
It helps me think.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.274
(clinks)

17:56.276 --> 17:57.842
That's a lot of thinking.
Mm-hmm.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.512
So, doctor...
Making house calls?

18:01.514 --> 18:05.249
Remember the b.R.C.A. Test
you canceled?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.752
Mm-hmm. The one that
saved the hospital $3,000--

18:07.754 --> 18:09.487
What about it?

18:09.489 --> 18:10.822
Well, I guess
they didn't get the facts

18:10.824 --> 18:13.825
Because they sent me
the results.
Oh.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.493
(pot lid clatters)
it's come back positive.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.763
Which means the risk
of a recurrence

18:18.765 --> 18:19.831
Of breast cancer is...

18:19.833 --> 18:22.600
(slams pot lid shut)
80%, yes.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.536
I know the prognosis.
Not great odds.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.506
(chopping)

18:28.508 --> 18:30.608
So they'll have
to come off. Hmm?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.210
Well, I-I think
that's a little hasty.

18:32.212 --> 18:36.380
There may be no need
for a double mastectomy.
Off!

18:36.382 --> 18:39.350
And the ovaries, too.
Just take 'em out.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.286
(chopping continues)

18:45.491 --> 18:48.693
(siren wailing in distance)

18:53.732 --> 18:55.500
<i>Karl thought I was</i>
<i>having an affair</i>

18:55.502 --> 18:57.468
<i>Because I sneak off</i>
<i>thursdays.</i>

19:01.773 --> 19:04.775
Well, we all have
our secrets.

19:04.777 --> 19:08.479
<i>I was gonna tell him</i>
<i>at the recital.</i>

19:08.481 --> 19:11.249
<i>See, I started</i>
<i>teaching this class--</i>

19:11.251 --> 19:12.750
<i>Young kids...</i>

19:12.752 --> 19:15.453
<i>Having their first recital</i>
<i>Thursday.</i>

19:18.490 --> 19:20.825
<i>I thought</i>
<i>maybe you could go.</i>

19:20.827 --> 19:22.860
<i>Be me.</i>

19:22.862 --> 19:25.696
And wear a tutu?
No, thank you.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.400
<i>No.</i>

19:29.402 --> 19:30.935
<i>See, before the kids</i>
<i>go on stage,</i>

19:30.937 --> 19:33.171
<i>We have this secret ritual.</i>

19:35.641 --> 19:37.308
<i>They can't dance without it.</i>

19:37.310 --> 19:40.845
You know, my, um...

19:40.847 --> 19:43.881
FiancÃ©e--

19:43.883 --> 19:48.486
Or I guess, ex-fiancÃ©e--
took me to a ballet once.

19:48.488 --> 19:53.958
(sighs) and I fell asleep.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.502
(strained voice) so why
live with the anxiety

20:04.504 --> 20:07.271
Of the recurrence of cancer
when you can take control?

20:07.273 --> 20:11.375
(cork pops)
but is a double mastectomy
the right way?

20:11.377 --> 20:12.810
I'm an all or nothing
kind of gal.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.846
But you want to keep
your nipples?

20:15.848 --> 20:17.748
Definitely.
(bottle thuds)

20:17.750 --> 20:21.919
Losing them reduces the risk
of recurrence to 1%.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.790
(sighs) where the hell
is that pizza?

20:25.792 --> 20:26.924
Ugh, I don't know.
I mean,

20:26.926 --> 20:28.726
After two bowls of soup,
I'm stuffed.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.495
Wait till you see
our delivery guy.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.631
(chuckles) you're drunk.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.367
(doorbell rings)

20:36.369 --> 20:37.902
(clinks)

20:37.904 --> 20:39.403
(cell phone buzzes)

20:39.405 --> 20:43.975
(chuckles) how are you?

20:43.977 --> 20:45.376
(man)
I'm well. How are you?
Hi.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.578
Well, I'm having a crap day.
How about you?

20:47.580 --> 20:50.715
Oh... (chuckles) stop.
Yeah, my spies told me that.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.516
How is she taking it?

20:52.518 --> 20:55.519
I think she's pretty much
in denial.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.656
Extra special topping...
Listen, I was thinking
about that, uh,

20:58.658 --> 21:00.424
That time you took me
to the ballet.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.461
And I just wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry...

21:03.463 --> 21:06.931
(inhales deeply)

21:06.933 --> 21:09.934
I'm sorry for spoiling it
because I fell asleep.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.670
Charlie...
You can't do this.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.372
You can't just call me.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.475
I know.
Anyways, you got it
backwards,

21:17.477 --> 21:19.577
Like you do everything.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.878
I'm the one who worked
the triple shift.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.480
I fell asleep.
You stayed awake.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.915
You loved it.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.684
(sniffs)

21:26.686 --> 21:29.353
(dana, chuckles)
that's strong.
I gotta go.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.660
Have a good evening.
Yes.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.728
(footsteps depart)

21:37.730 --> 21:40.798
(laughing)

21:44.069 --> 21:46.570
I just scored
some pot and a pizza.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.472
(laughter)

21:48.474 --> 21:50.508
Whoo!

21:50.510 --> 21:51.942
(box thuds)

21:51.944 --> 21:56.514
(chuckles) you are
officially out of control.

21:56.516 --> 22:00.051
Because I'm sick and tired
of being in control.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.053
I've been in control
my entire life.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.522
And where has it gotten me?
Huh?

22:04.524 --> 22:07.491
I'm passed over for chief,
my husband has left me

22:07.493 --> 22:11.896
For his secretary,
and I am paying him alimony.

22:11.898 --> 22:15.866
I'm a single mother
with breast cancer...

22:15.868 --> 22:17.401
Who's terrified
that she's never gonna

22:17.403 --> 22:20.971
Live to see her daughter
grow up.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.041
(whispers) dana.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.944
(sobs and inhales sharply)

22:26.946 --> 22:29.413
Sorry, I don't mean to get
maudlin, I--

22:29.415 --> 22:31.716
It's okay.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.619
It's just...

22:35.621 --> 22:37.421
(sighs)

22:37.423 --> 22:39.924
Remember how we used to pray
for these when we were kids?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.959
And then somehow we forget,
right? We--

22:41.961 --> 22:46.564
We just take them for granted,
but they are so useful...

22:46.566 --> 22:49.800
And pretty...
And they feed babies.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.102
Fun for the whole family.

22:51.104 --> 22:53.070
(sighs) girls...

22:53.072 --> 22:55.406
(inhales deeply)
it's been great.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.408
To the pointer sisters.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.811
So I appreciate you coming in
at the last minute.

23:00.813 --> 23:05.416
I know I wasn't supposed
to see you until next month.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.952
I'm just gonna examine
your range of motion.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.621
Has it ever given out on you?

23:15.694 --> 23:17.795
Very, very impressive, mate.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.563
Uh, how about we get you
down to the lab,

23:19.565 --> 23:22.099
Check out your blood,
just to, uh, be safe?

23:22.101 --> 23:25.169
(sighs)
that's it. Just walk.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.006
(exhales deeply)

23:32.444 --> 23:33.811
I hate to put you
through it again.

23:33.813 --> 23:37.681
Um...

23:37.683 --> 23:39.683
This hip has to come out.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.452
It's my anniversary
next month.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.421
I promised my wife
we'd go dancing.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.423
Well, how about I do it
this Thursday?

23:45.425 --> 23:47.691
(sighs)
I'll replace it with
a ceramic.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.630
(p.A. Tone sounds)

23:52.632 --> 23:55.699
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>on p.A.)</i>

23:57.135 --> 23:59.170
(p.A. Tone sounds)

24:05.744 --> 24:08.045
(grunts) you said you had some
sort of secret magic ritual

24:08.047 --> 24:10.681
For your dancers
for this recital thingy.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.651
<i>I'm not about to tell you</i>
<i>if you're not going.</i>

24:13.653 --> 24:17.955
But it's--it's only magic
that <i>you</i> can do.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.627
<i>Or my emissary.</i>

24:26.097 --> 24:27.898
Me talking to dancers
is stranger than

24:27.900 --> 24:32.036
Me talking to you.
(chuckles)

24:39.010 --> 24:40.544
Tell me what to say.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.683
<i>You'll know what to say.</i>

24:45.685 --> 24:48.752
No leotards, right?
<i>Mnh-mnh.</i>

24:53.091 --> 24:56.594
I'll do it.
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:58.964 --> 25:02.600
(whispers) whoa! Ah, shoot!
(chuckles)

25:02.602 --> 25:05.703
I'm so cold... (blows air)
come on.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.638
(dog barking in distance)
(exhales sharply) okay.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.908
Ah, come on. Don't tell me
we're locked out.
Oh!

25:10.910 --> 25:12.576
No, no, no, no, no, no,

25:12.578 --> 25:15.579
There's a key around here
someplace.
Unbelievable.

25:15.581 --> 25:18.048
Oh, come on.
You had a blast.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.084
You cannonballing
into that pool--

25:20.086 --> 25:23.020
That's the most fun you've had
since this whole charlie thing.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.689
Mm, you don't need to hear
my sad little story.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.291
No, I need to pee.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.759
Pee in a bush.
(whispers) okay.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.294
(wine sloshing in bottle)

25:30.296 --> 25:32.229
Where's the key?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.965
(vehicle approaches,
siren whoops)

25:34.967 --> 25:36.534
Oh, this is not good.
Oh.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.868
(car door closes)
I've got this.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.971
Okay.
(male officer)
evening, ladies.

25:40.973 --> 25:46.243
I had a call--
two naked trespassers.
(police radio chatter)

25:46.245 --> 25:49.179
She said we were allowed to.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.915
Well--
you said we were
allowed to.

25:50.917 --> 25:54.785
Actually...
(chuckles, blows raspberry)
okay, okay.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.587
Officer,
we are not trespassers.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.856
We're actually doctors.

25:58.858 --> 26:02.826
You want a tummy tuck?
I'm your gal.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.595
She lives here.

26:04.597 --> 26:07.865
Great. Let's go with that.
Okay.

26:07.867 --> 26:11.969
Can you tell me
your address?
Oh! Here it is.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.838
Shoot. Empty.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.274
Officer, if you could just
let us in,

26:17.276 --> 26:19.777
She'll be able to prove
that she lives...
(glass breaks)

26:19.779 --> 26:20.978
(radio chatter continues)

26:20.980 --> 26:22.713
Okay.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.282
(handle clicks,
glass shatters)
ooh! We're good to go.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.684
No! I was just--
just please--

26:26.686 --> 26:29.587
Hands on the hood!
Both of you.
(laughs)

26:29.589 --> 26:32.856
(whispers) this is serious.
I know.

26:32.858 --> 26:35.893
(blows raspberry) ooh, hey.
Don't make this a love story.
Okay.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.895
Okay, okay--
anything in your pockets
that could hurt me?

26:37.897 --> 26:40.831
Oh--oh.
Play the card.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.802
No.
Yes, if there was ever a time
to play the card, it's now.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.738
(static, radio chatter)

26:47.740 --> 26:50.741
Officer? Yeah, um...

26:50.743 --> 26:53.243
I-I have cancer,

26:53.245 --> 26:56.814
And so that's medicinal...
For chemo.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.782
I almost have a prescription.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.785
And she's writing me one.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.754
I'm her doctor.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.790
It's--it's fine.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.693
Thanks for calling.

27:09.695 --> 27:13.130
Hey, I need to bring you
up to speed.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.032
I called in all
of our mutual patients.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.401
Um, and I...

27:17.403 --> 27:19.036
You should take a look
at what I discovered.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.270
(purse thuds)

27:22.707 --> 27:24.241
What are those
cloudy bits right there?

27:24.243 --> 27:26.110
My guess is they are
pseudo-cysts.

27:26.112 --> 27:28.112
They are little pieces
of metal that have

27:28.114 --> 27:29.980
Broken away
from the implant.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.149
The immune system
sort of...

27:32.151 --> 27:34.218
Contains them
in the soft tissue.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.887
And, um... It's kind of like

27:36.889 --> 27:38.422
An oyster makes a pearl
out of a grain of sand.

27:38.424 --> 27:41.992
Except these pearls mean
my product is worthless.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.928
Look, if it was only
paulina's hip that had failed,

27:44.930 --> 27:46.230
Then I'd tell you
this is an outlier,

27:46.232 --> 27:50.134
But... To--to have 3
faulty hips out of 2 dozen--

27:50.136 --> 27:52.736
Suggests a catastrophic
design failure.
(alcohol pouring)

27:52.738 --> 27:54.004
It certainly destroys
your chance

27:54.006 --> 27:56.240
Of f.D.A. Approval, yeah.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.308
Mind you, the trouble may not
be with the product.

27:58.310 --> 28:02.079
It may just be the surgeon.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.114
I'm sorry, what did you say?

28:04.116 --> 28:07.151
You're the common denominator
here, joel.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.318
This could be surgical error.

28:08.320 --> 28:12.156
Uh, well, no one
can make that case.

28:12.158 --> 28:15.793
(chuckles) well, it doesn't
have to be true to do damage.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.031
I think you should leave.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.433
Gee, I didn't realize
when we slept together,

28:22.435 --> 28:26.003
That you had such thin skin.
It was one time.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.372
Mm.
It was as night of scotch
and bad judgment.

28:28.374 --> 28:33.043
It was twice,
if you count the elevator...

28:33.045 --> 28:37.081
(chuckles) and I do.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.985
(police radio chatter)
(sighs)

28:41.987 --> 28:43.987
Are you gonna tell molly?

28:43.989 --> 28:47.925
(sighs) why would I put
that anxiety on her?

28:47.927 --> 28:50.994
Right? I mean, her chances
of getting breast cancer,

28:50.996 --> 28:54.465
Even if she has inherited
the b.R.C.A. Gene,

28:54.467 --> 28:57.201
Are almost nil until
she's 35. And...

28:57.203 --> 28:58.736
(radio chatter continues)

28:58.738 --> 29:00.137
(sighs)

29:00.139 --> 29:02.272
(officer speaks indistinctly)

29:02.274 --> 29:05.008
(voice breaking) and I want her
to love her body,

29:05.010 --> 29:06.276
Not fear it.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.846
(police radio chatter)
(officer) okay.

29:08.848 --> 29:12.316
So if I can protect her from
reality a little while longer,

29:12.318 --> 29:15.018
I will.
Well...

29:15.020 --> 29:18.288
My mom never protected me
from anything, so...

29:18.290 --> 29:21.458
Okay.
(sighs)

29:21.460 --> 29:23.427
Everything checks out.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.862
Dr. Kinney,
I'm gonna go next door

29:24.864 --> 29:26.530
And see if I can get
the neighbor to calm down

29:26.532 --> 29:29.199
And forget about this.
So you're not gonna
arrest us?

29:29.201 --> 29:32.269
Um... Ca-can I keep my pot?
(chuckles)

29:32.271 --> 29:36.473
(sighs) my shirley
didn't make it.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.408
Stage 4 ovarian.
(sighs)

29:38.410 --> 29:41.345
You two take care.

29:41.347 --> 29:45.883
(breathes deeply)
good night, ladies.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.085
Good night.

29:50.989 --> 29:54.158
(voice breaking)
alex, please be my surgeon.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.562
(sighs) I can't--
I can't do this alone.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.297
I need to have
a friend in there with me.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.966
Sure, dana, of course.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.835
Mom?

30:04.837 --> 30:07.838
What the hell
is going on here?

30:07.840 --> 30:11.275
(chuckles) oh!
Are you drunk?

30:11.277 --> 30:13.277
(sighs) honey, erase this image
from your mind.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.145
Really, your mother
was possessed by a crazy lady,

30:15.147 --> 30:16.814
But she's back,
and she loves you

30:16.816 --> 30:20.017
Very, very much.
(chuckles) you're drunk.

30:20.019 --> 30:24.454
(sighs deeply)

30:28.359 --> 30:31.161
(monitor beeping steadily,
liquid pouring)

30:31.163 --> 30:34.298
Suctioning now.
(suction gurgling)

30:34.300 --> 30:36.300
Whoa, that is grotty.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.403
(whooshing and gurgling)

30:39.405 --> 30:40.838
How's that looking
for you?

30:40.840 --> 30:44.575
Like we're ready to go,
I think. (chuckles)

30:44.577 --> 30:46.310
Okay, let me loosen
the charnley, charlie.

30:46.312 --> 30:51.315
(clattering)

30:51.317 --> 30:52.916
All right.

30:58.423 --> 31:01.091
(cracks)

31:06.898 --> 31:09.967
(monitor beeps)

31:11.035 --> 31:14.104
(clanks)

31:18.109 --> 31:21.545
(squeaking and clattering)

31:21.547 --> 31:23.313
(joel) ready?

31:23.315 --> 31:26.049
(clanking)

31:30.521 --> 31:33.523
Look at that.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.993
It's in even worse shape
than paulina's.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.532
(thuds)

31:42.534 --> 31:44.101
I think I found
a way to reconcile

31:44.103 --> 31:47.571
With your desire
to keep your nipples.
(scoffs)

31:47.573 --> 31:49.473
Alex, forget my vanity.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.641
All I care about
is being around

31:50.643 --> 31:52.509
To see how molly's life
turns out.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.344
I get that,
but I can save them

31:54.346 --> 31:55.913
And still drop your risk
of recurrence

31:55.915 --> 31:57.547
From 5% down to 1%

31:57.549 --> 31:59.583
If I do
intraoperative radiation

31:59.585 --> 32:01.585
Before reconstruction.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.054
But we don't have
an intrabeam.
We do today.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.589
I called dave rothbarts
at western gen.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.059
His technician is setting it up
in o.R. 3 as we speak.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.161
I'll do the mastectomy,
wheel you next door...

32:11.163 --> 32:13.196
(package rips)
do the radiation,
zip you back over,

32:13.198 --> 32:16.333
And do reconstruction.
I can't believe dave rothbarts

32:16.335 --> 32:18.435
Is lending me
his prized possession.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.170
You have friends, dana...

32:20.172 --> 32:21.571
People who love you.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.341
(inhales sharply)

32:24.343 --> 32:26.310
I was at home,

32:26.312 --> 32:29.179
And someone put this
under my door.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.452
That's a confidential
document, man.
Sir, read it.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.653
Read it.

32:39.257 --> 32:42.059
(sighs)
sabian medical knew.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.328
It's all spelt out
right there. Check the date.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.664
It's last year, before paulina
even had her hip implant.

32:50.468 --> 32:54.538
Have you taken this
to a lawyer?
Of course I have.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.440
But paulina trusted you.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.208
I didn't know anything
about this, man.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.978
I know.
That's why I'm here.

33:02.513 --> 33:03.981
I need your help.

33:05.718 --> 33:09.619
The number two medical device
firm in the world.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.155
What are you, on drugs?
Okay.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.658
Forget I even asked.
Okay, you asked me.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.727
'cause you know that
charlie tilts at windmills,

33:16.729 --> 33:18.362
And you need a sane person
to tell you

33:18.364 --> 33:19.696
That you're gonna
blow up your career.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.698
Oh, come on, dawn.
They knew.
How?

33:21.700 --> 33:24.134
They knew the alloy would fail,
and yet they kept going.

33:24.136 --> 33:27.170
They made a calculation
that profits they would make

33:27.172 --> 33:28.739
Would be ten times what they'd
eventually have to pay out

33:28.741 --> 33:30.574
On the prosthesis that failed.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.110
Paulina durrell was just
a line item to them.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.379
Ten hospitals participated
in this trial.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.715
Seven of those hips
have failed.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.118
Paulina's the first fatality.

33:41.120 --> 33:45.088
Whether we want to or not.
Well, here comes
the drama queen.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.724
Every news story is not
gonna be "dr. Joel goran."

33:47.726 --> 33:51.161
It's gonna be "dr. Joel goran,
chief of surgery at hope zion."

33:51.163 --> 33:52.562
Dawn, they knew
the hip would fail,

33:52.564 --> 33:53.730
And yet,
they sold it anyway.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.233
A woman died here.

33:56.235 --> 33:58.802
My patient died.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.071
I have 2 dozen other patients
out there with the same implant.

34:01.073 --> 34:02.205
I can't do nothing.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.474
And you can't be
an effective chief

34:04.476 --> 34:08.412
If you take this on.
Alex is bringing her down
in five.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.747
Okay?

34:10.749 --> 34:13.450
So the lawyer's
on his way here to meet me.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.186
Just think it through, joel.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.722
Before you agree to anything,
just...
(slides paper, taps table)

34:18.724 --> 34:21.324
Really think it through.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.393
(chair clatters)

34:26.330 --> 34:31.435
(inhales and exhales deeply)

34:33.838 --> 34:37.174
(sighs)

34:37.176 --> 34:41.078
I  <i>love</i>this drug.
Mm.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.345
Mmm...
(chuckles)

34:42.347 --> 34:45.348
Emilia, have you gotten
your tv fixed yet?

34:45.350 --> 34:46.750
Uh, no, but I, uh,
check out tomorrow.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.785
You know what? 'cause I have
a big tv in my room.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.421
So why don't you come down
and watch it there?

34:51.423 --> 34:54.858
Uh, wow, sure. Thank--
thank you.
Okay. Good.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.427
Oh.
Is she stoned?

34:57.429 --> 35:01.498
Oh, my gosh. Oh, you guys.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.469
Dana, you look like you could
use a really awful hat.
Oh. (chuckles)

35:05.471 --> 35:07.471
You're with the best.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.506
The very best.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.241
Yeah.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.342
And hey, at least it's not
on your face, right?

35:12.344 --> 35:14.144
Right.
(laughter)

35:14.146 --> 35:18.682
You just let us know.
Yeah, errands, anything.
I'll see you in there.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.284
Yeah... Yeah, yeah.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.553
You're not losing 'em,
you're just replacing 'em.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.422
And you have a very good
chance of survival.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.158
(laughs)
first year med,

35:28.160 --> 35:31.361
You gave that lecture
on the art of surgery.

35:31.363 --> 35:35.232
(joel) yeah, you make us all
better, dana.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.767
It's time to return the favor.

35:37.769 --> 35:41.705
(sighs) thanks, guys.
Ready?

35:41.707 --> 35:44.774
All right.
(wheels clacking)

35:50.448 --> 35:53.750
(chuckles)

35:53.752 --> 35:56.753
I'm fine.

35:56.755 --> 36:00.490
I'll just hold your hand
while you get the needle.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.227
(exhales sharply
and whispers) okay.

36:04.229 --> 36:10.433
(breathing deeply)

36:13.538 --> 36:14.938
(monitor beeping steadily)

36:14.940 --> 36:18.208
Is she out?
Oh, yeah. She's had
the plat du jour--

36:18.210 --> 36:20.544
A hundred mics of fentanyl,
with a side of propofol.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.180
(inhales deeply) knife.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.584
(exhales deeply)

36:36.427 --> 36:38.828
Okay.

36:40.665 --> 36:42.365
(alex) kocher's.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.303
(instruments clattering)

36:53.377 --> 36:54.778
(whispers) all right.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.479
Retractor.

37:06.524 --> 37:07.624
(beeps)

37:07.626 --> 37:09.726
(instruments continue
clattering)

37:13.331 --> 37:15.832
(instrument clacks)
cautery.

37:19.537 --> 37:22.372
(high-pitched whirring,
searing)

37:22.374 --> 37:25.442
Way to work that superomedial.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.244
I feel like I'm on
the dark side of the moon.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.878
We got just the music
for that.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.780
Not today, victor.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.882
(monitors beeping)

37:42.326 --> 37:46.997
Hey.
(inhales sharply
and exhales deeply)

37:46.999 --> 37:50.834
People need to stop
doing that.

37:50.836 --> 37:54.504
Supposed to hate you.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.440
(scoffs) I want to.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.775
But then I look at you,

37:58.777 --> 38:01.444
And you seem as lost
and heartbroken as she does.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.748
(sighs)

38:04.750 --> 38:06.383
You still love her?

38:06.385 --> 38:10.320
More than sunshine.

38:10.322 --> 38:13.390
Then I can't figure out
why you did it.

38:15.026 --> 38:18.561
Why don't you take alex
to dinner?

38:18.563 --> 38:22.465
Talk to her,
listen to her.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.368
Be her friend.

38:25.370 --> 38:28.405
Just focus on that.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.076
I can palpate the tumor.

38:36.380 --> 38:39.883
(inhales deeply)
here it comes.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.519
(beeps)

38:44.455 --> 38:46.923
Maggie, mark the orientation
with a lateral stitch.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.591
Okay.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.531
It's about 3 centimeters.

38:54.533 --> 38:58.034
Yeah, let's get it to pathology.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.004
(sighs)

39:05.876 --> 39:08.945
<i>Ow!</i>

39:08.947 --> 39:11.648
(grunts and pants)

39:11.650 --> 39:13.350
(groaning) ow.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.119
These drains hurt like hell.
They pull up my skin.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.822
Are they supposed to be
just hanging down like this?

39:18.824 --> 39:20.724
Here, I, um, I--
I brought you this.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.726
It's a, um, it's a--
it's a runner's belt.

39:22.728 --> 39:27.130
They carry water in them,
but it--it works. (chuckles)

39:27.132 --> 39:28.465
Well...

39:28.467 --> 39:31.801
Thank you.
Yeah.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.704
Listen, um,
about the other day, um--

39:34.706 --> 39:37.574
Yeah, you were--
you were really bitchy.

39:37.576 --> 39:41.478
I mean, how are you gonna
survive chemo and radiation

39:41.480 --> 39:43.146
If you don't learn
how to fight?

39:43.148 --> 39:45.982
I'm... Still mad at you.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.785
<i>Good.</i>

39:48.787 --> 39:51.755
Yeah, like... (grunts)

39:51.757 --> 39:54.858
(grunts) yes--
yes, like that.

39:54.860 --> 39:55.925
(chuckles)
good, we're gonna
work on that.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.560
Okay.
Okay. (chuckles)

39:57.562 --> 40:00.630
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

40:04.068 --> 40:07.937
Hey, guys. Uh, I have
a little announcement to make.

40:10.474 --> 40:12.842
I'm afraid
a situation's arisen

40:12.844 --> 40:17.013
That makes my continuing here
as chief of surgery untenable.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.684
I'm therefore resigning
effective immediately.

40:21.686 --> 40:22.819
Wow.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.487
Why? What's going on?

40:24.489 --> 40:28.625
Wow. Kaboom...
(imitates explosion)

40:28.627 --> 40:31.828
(gavin) who's gonna be
the interim chief?
(shahir clears throat)

40:31.830 --> 40:34.097
Well, I-I think it has to be
someone fair, you know,

40:34.099 --> 40:37.100
Tough-minded and...
And objective.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.736
Obviously, that's for
the board to decide.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.539
Well, until that time, I'd like
to take this opportunity

40:42.541 --> 40:44.474
To throw my support
behind dawn.

40:50.748 --> 40:53.683
Okay.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.753
â™ª

41:05.596 --> 41:06.696
Okay.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.231
â™ª

41:08.233 --> 41:10.633
I'm in. Let's do it.

41:10.635 --> 41:14.938
â™ª

41:14.940 --> 41:18.174
Take it easy.
I know. I know.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.175
Nice.
(wheels and lever clack)

41:19.177 --> 41:24.948
The pathology report for
your sentinel node dissection...

41:24.950 --> 41:28.618
Negative.
Mom, that's great.
It is, right?

41:28.620 --> 41:32.088
It means I'm gonna be around
for a while.
Good. (chuckles)

41:32.090 --> 41:34.724
I thought you might want
to go over my pitch

41:34.726 --> 41:36.826
To the tumor board
for staging of chemo.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.796
No. I trust my doctor.

41:39.798 --> 41:43.800
We can go over it tomorrow.
No, no. Don't go.
Don't go.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.635
Stay, it's about to start.

41:45.637 --> 41:48.671
Sorry, I'm late. Popcorn.
Ooh.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.941
I snuck this past
the nurses' station.
(chuckles)

41:51.943 --> 41:53.576
It's a party.

41:53.578 --> 41:55.612
(molly) come on!
Come on!

41:55.614 --> 41:57.113
Come on.
Oh, what the hell.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.549
(laughter)

41:59.551 --> 42:00.850
(molly) it's starting,
it's starting, it's starting.
(dana) oh.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.985
<i>â™ª</i>

42:01.987 --> 42:04.087
(emilia) gimme some of that.

42:04.089 --> 42:07.257
Oh, I love it already.
(mouth full) me, too.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.793
Okay, they're gonna let
the audience in, in a second,

42:10.795 --> 42:13.696
But before they do,
I wanted to share

42:13.698 --> 42:16.866
A message with you from
your teacher--miss paulina--

42:16.868 --> 42:19.936
Who, unfortunately,
couldn't be with us tonight.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.805
Um, and she said,

42:22.807 --> 42:25.275
"tonight...

42:25.277 --> 42:30.113
"you are the keepers
of your own pixie dust.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.815
"so carry it with you.

42:32.817 --> 42:35.552
"and remember
our little secret.

42:35.554 --> 42:39.322
"every night is opening night,

42:39.324 --> 42:41.758
"and every step you take
is magic.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.793
So carry that in your hearts."

42:43.795 --> 42:45.728
Oh, and--
and who's colleen?

42:45.730 --> 42:47.964
Um...

42:47.966 --> 42:52.569
Keep your toe out.

42:52.571 --> 42:56.839
Anyway, one... Two...

42:56.841 --> 42:58.841
Three! Yay!
(girls) yay!

42:58.843 --> 43:00.743
Okay, places, everybody.
Places!

43:00.745 --> 43:03.212
(girls giggling)

43:03.214 --> 43:11.688
(man) â™ª just breathe
