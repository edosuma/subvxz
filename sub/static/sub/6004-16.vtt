J'SON: Distinguished guests
and dignitaries,

00:04.138 --> 00:05.947
thank you for being here
to dedicate this statue

00:05.982 --> 00:07.806
which celebrates the peace

00:07.842 --> 00:11.076
that I, King J'son of Spartax,

00:11.112 --> 00:13.513
continue to forge with
the realm of Asgard,

00:13.548 --> 00:15.098
represented here today

00:15.133 --> 00:19.460
by emissaries Thor and Angela.

00:19.495 --> 00:22.897
But the honor of this dedication
belongs to our newest hero,

00:22.932 --> 00:25.892
my son and heir,
Peter, the Star-Lord.

00:25.927 --> 00:27.393
(CROWD CHEERING)

00:32.892 --> 00:34.067
The Star-Lord.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.654
I'm here, I'm here.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.421
Hey, everyone!

00:39.457 --> 00:42.149
Let's get this party started.

00:42.185 --> 00:44.585
I hereby dedicate this
monument to my dad,

00:45.955 --> 00:47.371
King J'son of Spartax.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.842
Yeah, sorry, Dad.
This jacket is...

00:51.877 --> 00:53.953
Is a piece of clothing.

00:53.989 --> 00:56.072
Getting dressed should
not keep a Star-Lord

00:56.107 --> 00:58.908
from being on time.
Your duty is...

00:58.943 --> 01:02.295
To represent the empire in a manner befitting
the dignity of the blah, blah, blah...

01:02.330 --> 01:04.888
So when are you gonna tell me about
the Cosmic Seed, like you promised?

01:04.925 --> 01:06.457
Peter, now is not the time to...

01:06.492 --> 01:09.319
What do you know
of the Cosmic Seed?

01:09.354 --> 01:12.505
Forgive my sister's
bluntness, son of J.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.283
Angela is new to
her role in Asgard.

01:15.318 --> 01:17.902
But if the Seed is
in your possession...

01:17.937 --> 01:22.139
It would mean war, which
is why I do not have it.

01:22.174 --> 01:24.684
Then why does
your son speak of it?

01:24.719 --> 01:27.344
A misunderstanding,
I assure you.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.196
Had I realized you would
jump to conclusions...

01:29.232 --> 01:32.558
Are you implying something
of my sister, Spartaxian?

01:32.593 --> 01:36.245
We Asgardians take our family's
honor quite seriously.

01:36.281 --> 01:39.173
What are you implying,
prince helmet hair?

01:39.208 --> 01:41.626
Just like a Spartaxian to resort
to childish name-calling.

01:41.661 --> 01:44.162
Half Spartaxian!

01:44.197 --> 01:47.423
Looks like Quill's starting
an interplanetary incident.

01:47.458 --> 01:48.858
Again.

01:48.893 --> 01:49.951
Then we must help him.

01:49.986 --> 01:51.761
Drax, no.

01:51.796 --> 01:53.613
Wait. Let him go, Gamora.

01:53.648 --> 01:55.397
(CHUCKLING) This is
gonna be hilarious.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.600
A neo-maxi-zoomdweebie.

01:57.635 --> 01:59.852
I would keep your distance from
my friend, blonde-haired one,

01:59.888 --> 02:02.872
or you will deal with
Drax the Destroyer.

02:02.907 --> 02:05.975
The Destroyer, you say.

02:06.010 --> 02:08.477
Asgard has a destroyer
of our own.

02:08.512 --> 02:10.437
There is only one destroyer

02:10.473 --> 02:11.563
and it is not an
empty suit of armor!

02:11.599 --> 02:12.599
(GRUNTS)

02:16.237 --> 02:18.179

be hilarious.

02:18.214 --> 02:19.931

02:19.966 --> 02:21.407
Please forgive this outburst.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.342
You will pay the price
for striking my brother!

03:50.698 --> 03:54.241
This ruffian and his ilk
will be dealt with.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.869
There is no need
for alarm, son of J.

03:56.905 --> 03:59.480
The only casualty seems
to be your sculpture.

03:59.515 --> 04:01.549
By sheer luck.

04:01.584 --> 04:04.543
This display was
childish and costly, brother.

04:04.579 --> 04:06.595
And entirely my son's fault.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.848
I have been too
indulgent with him.

04:08.883 --> 04:11.767
Dad, they were just protecting me.
Enough!

04:11.803 --> 04:13.995
I hereby banish the Guardians
of the Galaxy from this palace.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.030
(ALL GASPING)

04:16.023 --> 04:19.033
Fine.

04:19.067 --> 04:19.867
We wouldn't stay another night
in this dump if you begged us.

04:19.902 --> 04:21.802
Come on, Quill.

04:21.837 --> 04:24.163
Ah, here's the thing.

04:24.199 --> 04:28.009
Um, I didn't get banished.
You guys did.

04:28.044 --> 04:31.670
King J'son banished the Guardians
of the Galaxy. You are our leader.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.106
Yeah, no, I mean,
I get that. It's just...

04:34.141 --> 04:36.025
Have you tried the palace beds?

04:36.060 --> 04:38.018
It's like sleeping on a cloud.

04:38.054 --> 04:39.612
After all the units I gave up

04:39.647 --> 04:41.597
so we could find
this Cosmic Seed

04:41.632 --> 04:43.725
and save all of existence,

04:43.760 --> 04:47.220
you're ditching us
for a nice bed?

04:47.255 --> 04:49.539
Look, I'm trying to get my
dad to talk about his quest

04:49.574 --> 04:52.391
for the Cosmic Seed,
so we can find it.

04:52.427 --> 04:55.077
But I kinda have to be in the
same room with him to do that.

04:55.113 --> 04:57.379
Lame excuse.
Even for you, Quill.

05:12.463 --> 05:13.796
(DOOR CLOSING)

05:13.831 --> 05:15.539
The Asgardians have left.

05:15.574 --> 05:17.725
But you might be able
to catch them,

05:17.760 --> 05:20.127
in case you wanted to start
another interplanetary incident.

05:20.162 --> 05:21.895
PETER: This thing
brought me here.

05:21.931 --> 05:23.531
And you may not like my friends,

05:23.608 --> 05:25.074
but they risked everything
to help me follow it.

05:25.109 --> 05:26.734
So I want answers now!

05:29.763 --> 05:31.714
Please.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.290
You must understand,

05:33.326 --> 05:34.992
I was young.

05:35.028 --> 05:36.877
I heard legends of an artifact,

05:36.912 --> 05:38.929
a force for good so powerful

05:38.965 --> 05:41.232
it would bring peace
to the universe,

05:41.267 --> 05:44.360
create a golden age
for all life.

05:44.395 --> 05:48.288
That artifact was
the Cosmic Seed.

05:48.324 --> 05:49.857
My father refused
to let a prince of Spartax

05:49.892 --> 05:51.800
chase after a myth.

05:51.836 --> 05:53.861
But, of course, I went anyway.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.671
And I found it too.

05:55.706 --> 05:58.323
You found the Cosmic Seed?

05:58.359 --> 05:59.474
But you told them
you didn't have it.

05:59.510 --> 06:02.344
And I don't. Not anymore.

06:02.380 --> 06:05.164
I used this CryptoCube
to hold the Seed as

06:05.200 --> 06:08.133
I headed back to Spartax
and record my journey.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.612
Every place I stopped, the Cube must
have emitted some of the Seed's energy.

06:11.648 --> 06:13.547
And every place the map led us,

06:13.583 --> 06:16.125
it absorbed back
some of that energy.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.735
The Cube wasn't
leading me to the Seed,

06:17.770 --> 06:19.695
it was leading me to you.

06:19.730 --> 06:22.165
So, where's the Seed now?

06:22.200 --> 06:26.435
Unfortunately, it was taken from
me by force before I made it home.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.391
J'SON: <i>My ship,</i>
Rora, <i>was damaged.</i>

06:30.516 --> 06:32.241
<i>We crashed-landed on Earth,</i>

06:32.276 --> 06:34.156
<i>where Meredith,
your mother, saved me.</i>

06:36.238 --> 06:38.739
<i>She was an amazing woman.</i>

06:38.775 --> 06:40.775
<i>Nursed me back to
health, single-handed.</i>

06:41.719 --> 06:44.620
<i>She was so beautiful.</i>

06:44.656 --> 06:47.289
<i>Suffice it to say
our romance was brief.</i>

06:47.325 --> 06:48.899
<i>I was called back to Spartax.</i>

06:48.934 --> 06:55.013
<i>War was coming. I had to protect
my home and the empire.</i>

06:55.049 --> 06:57.057
<i>I gave Meredith, my element
blaster and keyed the CryptoCube</i>

06:57.092 --> 06:58.292
<i>to both our DNA patterns.</i>

07:02.648 --> 07:04.648
<i>It was a promise
that I would return.</i>

07:06.368 --> 07:07.784
But my duties to the
empire prevented that.

07:07.820 --> 07:12.364
And then I heard the ravagers
had eliminated you both.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.085
In my anger, I hurled the Cube into
space and tried to forget everything.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.287
But I found it.

07:18.323 --> 07:21.273
Dad, it's destiny.

07:21.309 --> 07:24.652
I can get the Seed back. Just tell
me who stole it. I'll go right now.

07:24.729 --> 07:27.169
No. I won't let you make
the same mistake I did.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.486
You will forget this quest.

07:29.466 --> 07:30.799

<i>You disappoint me, J'son.</i>

07:49.379 --> 07:51.603
<i>We agreed,</i>

07:51.639 --> 07:54.431
<i>your son would find
the Cosmic Seed for me.</i>

07:54.466 --> 07:56.959
<i>Yet, you command him not to.</i>

07:56.994 --> 07:59.712
Of course, I did, Thanos.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.747
The surest way to make my son
do something is to forbid it.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.549
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

08:12.660 --> 08:14.777
Sorry, Pop.

08:14.812 --> 08:16.812
I may be a prince,
but I'm also a Ravager.

08:16.847 --> 08:18.087
And we don't take orders.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.674
Really, Dad?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.310
Don't have hardware
stores on Spartax?

08:31.346 --> 08:33.337
Unless these are
special questing tools.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.273
Guys, guess what we're gonna do?

08:44.308 --> 08:46.175
Watch you behave like a fool?

08:46.210 --> 08:49.411
Oh, wait, we already did.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.122
Okay, I messed up. I should
have stuck with you guys.

08:52.157 --> 08:55.492
It's just been so much pressure on
me with this whole prince thing.

08:58.072 --> 08:59.996
Hey, no sympathizing
with the traitor.

09:00.032 --> 09:03.492
Listen, I've got a plan I know
will get the Seed this time.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.538
And I also brought presents.

09:23.847 --> 09:25.087
I see no hook in Quill.

09:31.288 --> 09:33.539
So, after my dad
told me the story,

09:33.574 --> 09:36.883
I realized, we don't need to know
the Seed's location to find it.

09:36.919 --> 09:39.795
If the Cube's collected enough
energy from the places we've been,

09:39.830 --> 09:41.955
it should be able to restart the
teleporter thingy on Knowhere.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.849
The Continuum Cortex?

09:43.884 --> 09:46.126
Yeah, the teleporter thingy.

09:46.161 --> 09:48.754
Then all we gotta do is set it

09:48.790 --> 09:51.248
to take us to the greatest
concentration of cosmic energy.

09:51.284 --> 09:53.100
Which should be the Seed, right?

09:53.136 --> 09:54.793
COSMO: It is good idea,
Peter Quill,

09:54.828 --> 09:56.386
who is now officially
called Star-Lord.

09:56.422 --> 10:01.042
Although, Cosmo must point out that
Quill broke Cortex in first place.

10:01.077 --> 10:03.969
Me and Thanos.
Emphasis on Thanos.

10:04.005 --> 10:06.029
Remember? Of course.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.765
Is why Cosmo allowed
you to try this.

10:12.739 --> 10:15.814
Cosmo will send you
where most cosmic energy is.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.359
Then just tap wristband

to do about it?

get that tool bag?

12:07.177 --> 12:10.221
Well, the next time you have knockout
powder that can take out an Asgardian,

12:10.256 --> 12:11.496
use that first!

12:15.752 --> 12:16.752
Whoa.

12:23.995 --> 12:25.461
Don't think I don't
love you, Groot,

12:25.496 --> 12:27.704
but that is a tree.

12:27.740 --> 12:30.148
I am Groot.

12:30.183 --> 12:34.294
Looks like it's also the source
of the cosmic energy reading.

12:34.330 --> 12:37.514
Of course, we went to the largest
concentration of cosmic energy.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.232
That's not the Seed,

12:39.267 --> 12:41.494
it's the tree it came from.

12:41.529 --> 12:44.922
This is Yggdrasil,
the world tree.

12:44.957 --> 12:48.383
It's a bridge between
the nine realms of existence.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.994
Some say it's the source of all life in
the universe... (MACHINE POWERING UP)

12:51.029 --> 12:53.063
Sorry, but what did you say?

12:53.065 --> 12:54.839
Something very awe-inspiring
and unimportant.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.725
The Cosmic Seed detector
is pointing down,

12:56.760 --> 12:59.361
so down we go.

12:59.438 --> 13:01.388
Preferably, before any more
helmet heads show up.

13:01.423 --> 13:02.463
Sounds like a plan to me.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.302
Quill, you don't think it's
odd that your dad's bag

13:07.337 --> 13:09.989
just happens to have
the exact tools we need?

13:10.024 --> 13:13.304
It's not true. Look, there's no way
this chain is gonna be long enough.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.729
Oh, wait, cool! Ha-ha.

13:16.764 --> 13:18.522
No matter how much
you pull, it keeps going.

13:18.557 --> 13:20.048
(CHUCKLES) Thanks, genius.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.083
We grasp the concept.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.495
PETER: <i>Okay, here's the plan.</i>

13:24.530 --> 13:26.121
<i>Gamora, you're lookout.</i>

13:26.156 --> 13:28.765
<i>Drax lowers the chain,</i>

13:28.801 --> 13:31.601
<i>Groot climbs down while Rocket
and I hang onto him. Easy.</i>

13:31.636 --> 13:33.704
GAMORA: (ON COMMLINK) <i>Quill, I still
don't think this is a good idea.</i>

13:33.739 --> 13:36.072
<i>The Cosmic Seed
obviously came from here.</i>

13:36.108 --> 13:39.084
Which means your father
stole it from Asgard.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.512
So my dad was
a prince and a pirate?

13:41.547 --> 13:43.380
That's even more awesome.

13:43.415 --> 13:45.507
GAMORA: <i>No, Quill,
it means he's evil</i>

13:45.542 --> 13:48.084
<i>and I know evil fathers.</i>

13:48.120 --> 13:49.328
<i>Stealing the Seed
probably started the war</i>

13:49.363 --> 13:53.690
<i>between Asgard and Spartax
in the first place.</i>

13:53.726 --> 13:55.659
Come on, Gamora. If being
a thief makes you a bad guy,

13:55.695 --> 13:57.535
then none of us would be heroes.

13:58.364 --> 14:00.881
Heimdall, rise quickly. (GASPS)

14:00.958 --> 14:02.741
The intruders were heading
toward the world tree.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.526
Sound the alarm.

14:04.561 --> 14:05.828
HEIMDALL: At once, My Lord.

14:05.863 --> 14:08.023
I do not know what came over me.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.600
GAMORA: <i>Quill, the Cosmic Seed
is part of the world tree.</i>

14:12.636 --> 14:16.045
<i>It belongs to the Asgardians.
We should leave it alone.</i>

14:16.081 --> 14:17.823
PETER: The Cosmic Seed
was stolen from Dad

14:17.859 --> 14:19.792
before he crashed on Earth
and before the war.

14:19.827 --> 14:23.078
If it's here, it will prove
that my dad's innocent, kinda.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.388
Innocent-sminnocent.

14:25.423 --> 14:27.943
We didn't come all the way here
not to steal something, right?

14:28.786 --> 14:30.077
GAMORA: <i>Just make it quick.</i>

14:30.112 --> 14:32.112
Sorry, Gamora. I can't hear.

14:32.147 --> 14:34.081
You're breaking up.
ROCKET: Oh, seriously, Quill.

14:34.158 --> 14:37.517
You're going with the fake
signal glitch excuse?

14:37.553 --> 14:40.193
It's real. Something in the tree
is making our tech go wonky.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.474
I really didn't wanna say this.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.643
Then don't.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.895
PETER: The Seed was here,
but it's not anymore.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.097
You know, like always.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.957
How could you
possibly know that?

15:00.992 --> 15:02.592
That dent could
be from anything.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.182
I am Groot.

15:08.217 --> 15:10.367
That seems like a clue.

15:10.403 --> 15:13.361
I am Groot.

15:13.396 --> 15:15.638
First, it was too small.
Now, it's too big.

15:15.674 --> 15:17.808
Make up your mind.

15:17.843 --> 15:19.885
Ah, I can't believe it
got away from us again.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.504
(RATTLING) Quill?

15:22.540 --> 15:24.364
Just give me a second, Rocket,
I'm feeling stuff here.

15:24.399 --> 15:27.008
Quill, we've got problems!

15:27.044 --> 15:29.453
What? What is so important that it
can't wait one krutacking second?

15:29.488 --> 15:30.728
(GROWLING) Whoa!

15:32.374 --> 15:33.682
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

15:33.717 --> 15:34.924
(BLASTER POWERING UP)

15:34.960 --> 15:36.752
(POWERS DOWN) That's not fair!

15:36.787 --> 15:38.453
Why won't our tech
work down here?

15:38.489 --> 15:39.729
I'll make it work.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.357
(GROWLING)

15:44.753 --> 15:46.911
We gotta leave, like, now.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.613
Argh! What the flarg
are these things?

15:48.649 --> 15:50.974
I am Groot!

15:51.009 --> 15:53.026
ROCKET: Natural defenses?

15:53.061 --> 15:55.101
Didn't wanna mention that
before they attacked us?

15:55.364 --> 15:56.521
I am Groot!

15:56.556 --> 15:57.556
Groot!

15:59.568 --> 16:00.568
(BOTH PANTING)

16:05.574 --> 16:06.574
(BOTH SCREAMING)

16:07.884 --> 16:09.124
(GROWLING)

16:10.379 --> 16:14.230
I am Groot!

16:14.266 --> 16:16.525
Drax, if you can
hear me, pull us up.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.560
(GROWLING)

16:22.907 --> 16:24.224
I knew this would end badly.

16:25.494 --> 16:26.494
(SHOUTING)

16:29.390 --> 16:31.723
(BOTH GRUNTING)

16:31.759 --> 16:34.000
It seems I must defeat
you all over again.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.356
I was not the one defeated!
(GRUNTING)

16:39.617 --> 16:40.617
I am Groot.

16:41.610 --> 16:42.492
(ALL GROWLING)

16:42.527 --> 16:43.527
Ah!

16:45.389 --> 16:48.089
Drax, what part of "Pull
us up" didn't you get?

16:48.124 --> 16:50.409
Gamora, I need cover.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.084
I'm on it. Get them up.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.346
(SHOUTING)

17:06.526 --> 17:10.203
Whatever you are attempting to
remove from the world tree,

17:10.239 --> 17:11.479
you will not succeed, villain.

17:12.374 --> 17:13.522
(GRUNTS)

17:19.130 --> 17:20.329
I will not leave my friends.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.167
Drax, pick a direction!

17:25.203 --> 17:27.369
Okay, time for plan B.

17:27.405 --> 17:29.885
Use the passports to
teleport outta here.

17:31.018 --> 17:32.742
Uh, ain't we supposed to
teleport with them?

17:32.777 --> 17:35.328
Okay, onto plan C.

17:35.363 --> 17:37.530
Yikes. Which is?

17:37.565 --> 17:39.685
Still working on that part.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.384
Fortunately, so is Drax.

17:44.373 --> 17:46.398
You get us out of this one,
Drax, and I'll give back

17:46.433 --> 17:48.714
almost everything
I ever stole from...

17:49.954 --> 17:50.954
Okay, this is bad.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.531
That it is, Star-Lord.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.667
Verily bad.

17:57.703 --> 18:00.636
THOR: With my father
in the Odin sleep,

18:00.672 --> 18:04.749
it falls to me to mete out
punishment for this attempted theft.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.618
Not just theft, brother.

18:06.653 --> 18:11.381
The Star-Lord himself has attacked
the very heart of Asgard.

18:11.416 --> 18:14.767
This is clearly an
act of war by Spartax.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.686
You're listening to this guy?

18:16.722 --> 18:19.456
Last time we met him, he...

18:19.491 --> 18:23.585
Prisoners in Asgard do not speak
unless spoken to, mortal.

18:23.620 --> 18:27.655
And yet, I would
hear his defense.

18:27.691 --> 18:31.751
(SIGHS) Okay. So we
were after the Cosmic Seed,

18:31.787 --> 18:34.112
but only to prove once and for
all that my dad doesn't have it.

18:34.148 --> 18:38.750
You and Spartax have been on the edge
of war for decades over nothing.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.451
(SIGHS) It is true.

18:40.487 --> 18:45.749
We've always harbored suspicions
about the Seed's location.

18:45.784 --> 18:49.243
Even after Heimdall used his all-sight
to search the entire Spartax empire,

18:49.279 --> 18:50.628
he never found the Seed.

18:50.664 --> 18:54.291
Well, maybe you should ask
your brother Loki where it is.

18:54.326 --> 18:59.546
My mind was thoroughly searched
when the Seed was stolen.

18:59.581 --> 19:02.307
This mortal whelp is merely attempting
to deflect his own punishment.

19:02.342 --> 19:07.278
They must all be executed
according to our laws!

19:07.314 --> 19:10.523
You'd have me start
a war, brother.

19:10.559 --> 19:13.852
I would have you acknowledge
that a war's already begun!

19:13.887 --> 19:16.429
How so, Loki?

19:16.465 --> 19:18.807
Nothing was taken and the
world tree is undamaged.

19:18.842 --> 19:20.800
If this was an act of war,

19:20.835 --> 19:22.802
it was a feeble one, indeed.

19:22.838 --> 19:24.813
Too true, sister.

19:24.848 --> 19:27.089
I see no infraction here,

19:27.125 --> 19:28.875
and no reason to create one

19:28.910 --> 19:31.244
for this youthful indiscretion.

19:32.414 --> 19:34.122
I know what it is like

19:34.157 --> 19:36.975
to live in a father's
shadow, Star-Lord.

19:37.011 --> 19:40.278
But in your haste to
outdo his legacy,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.923
never forget that you
are building your own.

19:47.329 --> 19:49.312
I'm shocked to learn
my own son would behave

19:49.347 --> 19:52.174
in such a reckless,
treasonous manner!

19:52.209 --> 19:55.001
Take my word, Thor, son of Odin,

19:55.037 --> 19:59.589
Star-Lord and the rabble he insists
on consorting with will be punished.

19:59.624 --> 20:03.551
I have no doubt
they will, son of J.

20:03.586 --> 20:05.671
Dad, I can explain.
(DOOR CLOSING)

20:05.706 --> 20:07.205
Don't blather, son.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.890
It's unworthy of your station.

20:08.926 --> 20:10.742
Where's the Seed?

20:10.777 --> 20:13.128
No, I mean, I really
don't have it. I...

20:13.163 --> 20:15.546
Wait, you wanted me
to steal the Seed.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.934
Of course, you did! You even
left me the tools to do it.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.927
I did no such thing.

20:20.962 --> 20:23.388
I merely hoped that if my heir

20:23.465 --> 20:26.299
was going to put our planet
on the brink of war,

20:26.334 --> 20:29.010
he'd be competent enough
to get what he was after.

20:29.046 --> 20:31.480
You know what,
I may be your son,

20:31.515 --> 20:33.765
but you can find
yourself another heir.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.809
It's time for me and
my real family to go,

20:35.844 --> 20:36.844
Your Highness.

20:41.759 --> 20:44.367
Thor never even suspected
that I gave the Star-Lord

20:44.402 --> 20:47.329
the tools he needed
to assault Asgard.

20:47.364 --> 20:49.914
By the time he realizes
my part in this,

20:49.949 --> 20:52.942
it will be far too late.

20:52.978 --> 20:57.072
I will have war between
Asgard and Spartax.

20:57.107 --> 21:00.875
A war that will topple that ignorant
hammer-throwing fool off his throne.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.978
I promise you, Odin,

21:04.014 --> 21:07.007
a true king will rule Asgard.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.092
Me.

21:11.863 --> 21:12.470
GAMORA: We're
proud of you, Quill.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.949
Giving up your birthright
couldn't have been easy.

21:15.984 --> 21:19.160
Eh, what does a smelly old
palace have that we don't?

21:19.195 --> 21:22.406
Except spa tubs, free slippers,
those awesome pillows.

21:22.408 --> 21:23.974
Can I get one of those
pillows I gave you guys?

21:24.009 --> 21:25.129
(CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

21:26.862 --> 21:29.371
I am Groot.

21:29.406 --> 21:37.406
