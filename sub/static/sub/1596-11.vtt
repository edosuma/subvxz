COWS AND CHICKENS TOO?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.097

09:15.097 --> 09:17.140

09:17.140 --> 09:21.478
CABLE, UTILITY, RENT.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.618

THAT'S A FELONY.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.620

09:38.620 --> 09:40.748

09:40.748 --> 09:42.792
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

09:42.792 --> 09:45.711
- AH, BUT FIONA'S
AWARE OF YOUR PLANS, I ASSUME.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.962
YOU'RE GETTING CARELESS.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.631
DON'T.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.801
[door opens]
- HEY.

09:51.801 --> 09:53.593
- HEY. UH...
[clears throat]

09:53.593 --> 09:55.262
BAD TIME?

09:55.262 --> 09:58.932
- NO, JUST PUTTING TOGETHER
SOME BABY STUFF WAY PREMATURELY.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.642
- [chuckles]
- WHAT'S UP?

10:00.642 --> 10:03.103
- UM, I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.648
- WELL, IF IT'S ABOUT INFANTS,
COLLEGE, OR TINY DICKS,

10:05.648 --> 10:07.024
I'M THE WRONG GUY.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.734
- UH, NO, IT'S, UM--

10:08.734 --> 10:10.819
IT'S ABOUT CRAZY.
YOU WERE MARRIED TO ONCE.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.655
- WHY, IS MANDY GOING
A LITTLE CUCKOO FOR COCOA PUFFS?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.907
- YEAH, I THINK SHE RAN OVER
KAREN WITH HER CAR.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.494
- WHAT?

10:19.494 --> 10:21.455
- I THINK SHE--SHE RAN OVER
KAREN WITH HER CAR,

10:21.455 --> 10:24.207
AND ALSO SHE--SHE CARRIES THIS
LIKE HUGE STOCKPILE OF ARMS--

10:24.207 --> 10:26.752
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.336
YOUR CURRENT GIRLFRIEND

10:28.336 --> 10:31.548
RAN OVER YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND
WITH A CAR?

10:31.548 --> 10:33.633
- SIGNS POINT TO YES.
I MEAN, I--

10:33.633 --> 10:35.678
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S CAPABLE OF.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.845
- DUDE,
YOU'RE AT DEFCON ONE.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.472
YOU NEED TO GET
THE FUCK OUTTA THERE.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.931
- TELL ME HOW.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.892
- VERY SLOWLY.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.519
YOU NEED TO MAKE HER THINK
IT'S HER IDEA.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.771
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.190
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET
BEHIND THE WHEEL,

10:48.190 --> 10:50.400
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.277
- OKAY. I MEAN, I'M--
I'M--I'M GONE A LOT, YOU KNOW?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.862
THEY NEED A LOT OF HELP
OVER AT KAREN'S, SO--

10:53.862 --> 10:55.363
- WHOA, WHOA, LIP,
WAIT, WAIT.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.074
DOES MANDY KNOW
YOU'RE GOING OVER THERE?

10:57.074 --> 10:59.493
- YEAH.
YEAH, I MEAN, I TOLD HER--

10:59.493 --> 11:01.119
- LIP, YOU CAN'T
TELL HER THAT SHIT!

11:01.119 --> 11:02.872
THAT'S LIKE WAVING THE FLAG
IN FRONT OF THE BULL!

11:02.872 --> 11:04.206
- WELL--
- HIDE THE CAR KEYS,

11:04.206 --> 11:06.666
STOP SHOWERING,
AND YOU TELL HER NOTHING.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.253
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT--LIP.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.380
DO NOT LET HER BONE YOU,

11:12.380 --> 11:15.550
BECAUSE THAT OXYTOCIN STUFF
MAKES THEM ADHESIVE.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.762
YOU GOT IT?

11:17.762 --> 11:18.762
- YEAH.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.267
- I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO YOU.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.144
FIONA AND LIP WILL BE MAD.
- WELL, OF COURSE THEY WILL.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.563
THEY TREAT ME LIKE A LEPER
BECAUSE I'M "A BAD FATHER."

11:28.563 --> 11:29.940
YEAH, RIGHT.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.983
TELL YOU, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN BAD PARENTING

11:31.983 --> 11:34.486
TILL YOU WITNESS MY MOTHER
IN HER GLORY DAYS.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.696
HAD THIS PIECE OF WOOD
SHE CALLED A RETRIBUTION STICK.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.699
FLAT SIDE, SKINNY SIDE.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.743
IF I DID SOMETHING SMALL,
LIKE STEAL AN EXTRA COOKIE

11:41.743 --> 11:44.579
OR PISS IN HER SHAMPOO BOTTLE--
WHACK. FLAT SIDE.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.248
BUT IF I DID
SOMETHING HEINOUS,

11:46.248 --> 11:48.125
LIKE SET FIRE TO HER BED
WHEN SHE WAS NAPPING,

11:48.125 --> 11:50.669
OR RAT HER OUT FOR HER
GARAGE GAMBLING RING,

11:50.669 --> 11:52.045
THE SKINNY SIDE.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.172
LIKE A WHIP.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.674
WHACK! WHACK!
WHACK, WHACK, WHACK!

11:55.674 --> 11:57.134
WHACK! WHACK!

11:57.134 --> 11:59.177
WHACK! BUT DID I
THROW THAT BITCH

11:59.177 --> 12:01.221
INTO THE GUTTER
WHEN SHE NEEDED A HOME? NO.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.099
I BRUSHED HER HAIR.
I WASHED HER SAGGY TITS.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.851
I IRRIGATED HER ULCERS.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.727
I NURSED HER
ALL THE WAY TO THE GRAVE.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.731
BUT YOU PEOPLE, MAKING ME
HOMELESS IN THE DEAD OF AUTUMN?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.401
AFTER I GOT YOU
THROUGH CANCER?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.778
I SLEPT ON A TRAIN
LAST NIGHT!

12:16.778 --> 12:18.530
- COOL. CAN I TRY THAT?

12:18.530 --> 12:21.741
- NO! IT'S BARBARIC.
I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO!

12:21.741 --> 12:24.828
DO YOU GET IT?

12:24.828 --> 12:27.455
- I COULD SNEAK YOU
IN THE VAN TONIGHT.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.960
- YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.546
YOU LITTLE PIKER, YOU.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.614
- YOU MADE IT.

13:00.614 --> 13:04.951
CHAIRS ARE OVER HERE,
AND WATCH OUT FOR SPLINTERS.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.954
YOU KNOW, UM,
LIP IS STILL UP KAREN'S ASS.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.582
IT'S GETTING OLD.

13:10.582 --> 13:11.958
- YEAH.

13:11.958 --> 13:16.254
SO, SVETLANA.
SHE LIKE, UH--

13:16.254 --> 13:17.882
- SHE'S QUIET.

13:17.882 --> 13:19.216
AND SKINNY, WHICH IS WEIRD,

13:19.216 --> 13:20.842
'CAUSE HE USUALLY
BAGS FAT CHICKS.

13:20.842 --> 13:24.013
I DO HIS LAUNDRY.

13:24.013 --> 13:26.514
I APPLY TO COLLEGES FOR HIM,
AND WHAT THE HELL DOES KAREN DO?

13:26.514 --> 13:30.477
DROOLS AND FARTS.
I MEAN, COME ON.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.603
- THINK HE LOVES HER?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.022
- SHE'S BRAIN-DEAD.

13:33.022 --> 13:35.106
- I MEAN MICKEY.
- I DUNNO.

13:35.106 --> 13:37.275
TONS OF GUYS
GET CHICKS KNOCKED UP

13:37.275 --> 13:39.527
AND DON'T GET HITCHED, SO...

13:39.527 --> 13:41.738
DAD'S SUPER EXCITED.
PLANNED THE WHOLE THING.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.741
INVITED HIS BUDS
FROM THE GUN CLUB.

13:44.741 --> 13:49.287
IT'S KIND OF SWEET.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.414
[chair clatters]

13:51.414 --> 13:56.044
[phone playing
animal sounds]

13:58.088 --> 13:59.839
- HEY, LOOK WHAT I
STOLE FROM WORK.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.967
- THREE CHEERS

14:01.967 --> 14:03.886
- TAKE SOME CREAM
WITH THAT HOSTILITY?

14:03.886 --> 14:06.013
- OH, NO, IT'S FINE,
JUST WHISK MY BEST FRIEND OFF

14:06.013 --> 14:07.639
WHEN I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY,
NO BIGGIE.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.016
- WHOA,
WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE ALREADY?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.850
- NOT "PEOPLE." JUST V.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.061
AND MIKE FROM WORK, WHO SAYS
HE'LL LOOK INTO TRANSFERRING ME.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.854
- OH, DON'T GET
YOUR PANTIES IN A WAD.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
I KNOW HOW
TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.400
LOOK, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
I'M JUST SAD FOR ME.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.026
- OH...
DON'T WORRY,

14:20.026 --> 14:23.280
WE'LL COME VISIT
YOUR LI'L PEANUT ONCE A MONTH.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.990
OR YOU COULD COME STAY WITH US.
[cell phone ringing]

14:24.990 --> 14:27.200
I FOUND A COUPLE FOUR- AND FIVE-
BEDROOM HOUSES ONLINE TODAY.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.536
CHEAPER THAN CHICAGO.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.954
PIZZA!

14:30.954 --> 14:35.084
COME GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT!

14:35.084 --> 14:36.876

14:36.876 --> 14:37.877

14:37.877 --> 14:39.921

14:39.921 --> 14:43.008
- CHEW YOUR FOOD LIKE A HUMAN.
[phone whinnies]

14:43.008 --> 14:44.467
SO, MIKE FROM THE OFFICE

14:44.467 --> 14:47.012

CAMPING TRIP THIS WEEKEND,

14:52.350 --> 14:54.019
INTERESTED?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.979
- LOVE CAMPING IN THEORY,
EXCEPT FOR THE BUGS,

14:55.979 --> 14:57.272
AND THE DIRT,
AND THE GROUND-SLEEPING.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.398
BUT YEAH, SOUNDS GREAT.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.191
MWAH.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.569
WELL,

15:07.449 --> 15:09.284

15:09.284 --> 15:11.870
YOU GUYS KNOW
HOW JIMMY'S THINKING ABOUT

15:11.870 --> 15:13.580
MAYBE GOING BACK
TO MED SCHOOL?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.581
- MM-HMM.
- NO.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.291
- OKAY, WELL,

15:16.291 --> 15:18.126
IF HE DOES,

15:18.126 --> 15:22.088
IT WOULD BE IN MICHIGAN.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.256
- HE'D LEAVE US?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.259
- OR WE'D GO WITH HIM.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.012
MAYBE.

15:28.012 --> 15:30.513
- TO MICHIGAN.
WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

15:30.513 --> 15:31.514
- WELL, IT'LL ONLY
BE FOR A YEAR.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.017
AND NOTHING'S DECIDED.

15:33.017 --> 15:34.476
I JUST WANT YOU
TO START THINKING ABOUT IT.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.935
- WHAT ABOUT FRANK?
WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM HERE.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.021
- OF COURSE WE CAN.
- BUT IT'S GETTING COLD.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.315
- HIS THICK LAYER OF BULLSHIT
WILL KEEP HIM WARM.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.734
[cell phone ringing]

15:42.734 --> 15:44.944

MM.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.863
HELLO?

15:46.863 --> 15:49.157

15:49.157 --> 15:51.743
OH, WOW, WHERE IS IT?

15:58.249 --> 16:02.379
I WILL PASS THAT ON.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.259
THE APPLICATION

16:08.259 --> 16:09.803
- WHAT'S A STUDIO?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.221
- IT'S A ONE-ROOM APARTMENT,
DEBS.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.014
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WASN'T DECIDED YET.

16:13.014 --> 16:16.393
- HOW ARE WE ALL
GONNA FIT IN ONE ROOM?

16:21.065 --> 16:22.982
[door opens]

16:22.982 --> 16:25.318

LOOK AT YOU, SWEET GIRL!

16:34.035 --> 16:36.871

16:39.041 --> 16:42.877
OH, MY GOSH, THE COLOR'S

17:10.321 --> 17:12.824
I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T
INSTALL THE RAILS OUTSIDE.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.827
IT'S JUST BEEN SO WET.

17:15.827 --> 17:20.457
UM, ARE YOU HUNGRY?
I MADE SMOOTHIES.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.499
I'LL GET YOU SOME.

17:21.499 --> 17:25.670
[door opens, closes]

17:28.465 --> 17:31.718
HERE WE GO.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.388

17:35.388 --> 17:37.141
- IT'S A SMOOTHIE.

17:37.141 --> 17:40.144
- [slurping]

17:47.066 --> 17:48.818
AHH...

17:48.818 --> 17:50.487
I LIKE THE COLD

17:50.487 --> 17:53.490
AND THE TONGUE-TASTE.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.782
WHAT IS THIS?

17:54.782 --> 17:57.660
- WELL, IT'S A SMOOTHIE.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.370

[inhales]

18:01.581 --> 18:05.001
MM, GOOD NIGHT.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.175
- WHAT DID DR. RON
SAY ABOUT THIS?

18:12.175 --> 18:14.136
- SHE STILL HAS
MOST OF HER OLD MEMORIES,

18:14.136 --> 18:16.888
SHE JUST CAN'T FORM
ANY NEW ONES.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.223
GOT SOME PAMPHLETS
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

18:18.223 --> 18:19.224
- YEAH, THANKS.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.268
UM, WHEN'S IT GO AWAY?

18:22.268 --> 18:24.103
- EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT,
YOU KNOW?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.273
COULD BE PERMANENT,
BUT I SAY WE KEEP HOPE ALIVE.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.441
I GOT FAMILY DOWN IN SEDONA.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.984
THEY HAVE
HEALING VORTEXES OUT THERE.

18:29.984 --> 18:30.985
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS
AND STUFF.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.237
- OH, SHE JUST GOT HOME.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.114
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE NEEDS YET.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.534
SHE SEEMS NICER THOUGH.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.454
- HEY.
