WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:01.600
<i>So here's what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:01.660 --> 00:03.613
<i>Quinn and Puck want their baby back,
but then Puck kissed Shelby,</i>

00:03.621 --> 00:04.630
<i>so now he doesn't know
what side he's on.</i>

00:04.671 --> 00:05.721
Do you want
our baby back or not?

00:05.747 --> 00:06.935
<i>Santana and Brittany have</i>

00:06.969 --> 00:08.416
<i>a secret thing going,
and they quit</i>

00:08.450 --> 00:09.620
<i>the Glee Club with Mercedes
to join the Trouble Tones.</i>

00:09.659 --> 00:11.081
Awesome! More backup for me.

00:12.505 --> 00:13.835
<i>because they're both
running for Congress.</i>

00:13.888 --> 00:15.880
I'm too late to get
on the ballot, but I can still

00:15.921 --> 00:17.672
<i>run as a write-in candidate.
And Kurt and Rachel and Brittany</i>

00:17.711 --> 00:19.000
<i>are all mad
at each other because</i>

00:19.066 --> 00:20.053
<i>they're all running
for class president.</i>

00:20.087 --> 00:20.997
I will see you at the debate.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.354
<i>Everyone's mad at each other.</i>

00:22.393 --> 00:23.143
<i>It's crazy.
No, you're crazy!</i>

00:23.180 --> 00:24.337
Did you airbrush out your jowls?

00:24.391 --> 00:25.479
I can't work with her!

00:25.507 --> 00:26.678
I thought I smelled blue collar.

00:26.731 --> 00:27.984
Stop!
Would you turn that thing off?

00:28.005 --> 00:29.374
<i>And that's what
you missed on Glee.</i>

00:32.940 --> 00:34.177
<i>It's happened.</i>

00:34.212 --> 00:36.469
<i>The Lion King, Puckfasa,
has been caged.</i>

00:36.503 --> 00:38.959
<i>I've been in love before,
but this time feels different.</i>

00:38.993 --> 00:40.976
<i>This time feels grown up.</i>

00:40.996 --> 00:41.969
<i>Don't judge me.</i>

00:42.016 --> 00:43.428
<i>I'm 18; it's legal.</i>

00:43.463 --> 00:45.460
<i>Besides, the age difference
isn't that crazy.</i>

00:45.494 --> 00:47.453
<i>Just look at Ashton and Demi,
Indiana Jones and Ally McBeal,</i>

00:47.487 --> 00:49.457
<i>Woody Allen
and that Chinese girl.</i>

00:49.491 --> 00:51.028
<i>I get that teacher/student
relationships are tricky,</i>

00:51.097 --> 00:52.938
<i>but aren't all relationships?</i>

00:52.981 --> 00:55.917
<i>I'm willing to put in
the work for this one.</i>

00:59.514 --> 01:02.474
<i>When she looks at me, I don't
feel like a boy anymore.</i>

01:02.508 --> 01:05.010
<i>I feel like the man
that I've always wanted to be.</i>

01:05.045 --> 01:06.545
<i>A family man.</i>

01:06.595 --> 01:08.494
<i>I live for fourth period.</i>

01:08.517 --> 01:10.144
<i>Shelby's been subbing for
Mr. Clippenger in Geometry</i>

01:10.178 --> 01:11.515
<i>ever since he ate
that bad cantaloupe.</i>

01:11.543 --> 01:13.107
<i>I know I'm supposed to be
learning about</i>

01:13.168 --> 01:14.986
<i>grammars and stuff,
but all I can think about</i>

01:15.020 --> 01:17.103
<i>is what color underwear
Ms. C is wearing</i>

01:17.149 --> 01:18.723
<i>and if she knows how to dance.</i>

01:25.814 --> 01:27.456
Did you do your homework, dude?

01:32.416 --> 01:35.578
Wait. W-Wait
a second, man.

01:35.580 --> 01:39.002
What do you think the teacher's
gonna look like this year?

01:39.036 --> 01:41.550
Whoa!

01:44.171 --> 01:47.049
¶ T-Teacher,
stop that screaming ¶

01:47.088 --> 01:49.173
¶ Teacher, don't you see?

01:49.207 --> 01:52.677
¶ Don't want to be
no uptown fool ¶

01:52.711 --> 01:55.675
¶ Maybe I should go to hell,
but I am doing well ¶

01:55.709 --> 02:00.268
¶ Teacher needs to see me
after school ¶

02:00.318 --> 02:04.388
¶ I think of all the education
that I missed ¶

02:04.402 --> 02:07.405
¶ But then my homework
was never quite like this ¶

02:10.723 --> 02:14.505
¶ Oh, got it bad,
got it bad, got it bad ¶

02:14.541 --> 02:16.917
¶ I'm hot for teacher

02:18.666 --> 02:22.211
¶ I got it bad, so bad

02:22.245 --> 02:24.764
¶ I'm hot for teacher

02:28.765 --> 02:31.766
Ah, I think the clock
is slow, man.

02:31.802 --> 02:32.772
I don't feel tardy.

02:32.799 --> 02:34.020
Ah, I just been here so long.

02:34.057 --> 02:36.226
I got to get out of here.

02:36.260 --> 02:38.854
Class dismissed!

02:42.059 --> 02:46.733
¶ I heard about your lessons,
but lessons are so cold ¶

02:46.767 --> 02:49.654
¶ I know about this school

02:49.703 --> 02:53.872
¶ Little girl from Cherry Lawn,
how can you be so bold? ¶

02:53.902 --> 02:57.621
¶ How did you know
that golden rule? ¶

02:57.657 --> 03:00.714
¶ I think of all the education
that I missed ¶

03:00.748 --> 03:04.886
¶ But then my homework
was never quite like this ¶

03:07.758 --> 03:11.312
¶ Whoa, got it bad,
got it bad, got it bad ¶

03:11.346 --> 03:13.645
¶ I'm hot for teacher

03:15.228 --> 03:18.678
¶ I've got it bad, so bad

03:18.729 --> 03:21.903
¶ I'm hot for teacher

03:21.935 --> 03:25.569
¶ Whoa, oh, yes, I'm hot

03:25.601 --> 03:28.305
¶ Oh, whoa, oh, yes, I'm hot

03:28.327 --> 03:30.356
¶ Whoa.

03:34.443 --> 03:36.246
Whoo!

03:36.279 --> 03:37.326
Wow!

03:37.364 --> 03:39.506
Puck, guys, spectacular!

03:39.530 --> 03:41.006
What a way
to start off this week!

03:41.038 --> 03:41.918
You guys didn'td

03:41.963 --> 03:43.290
an assignment to work on this.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.710
You just did it.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.852
Mr. Schuester, while
the performance was excellent...

03:46.882 --> 03:48.257
particularly the drumming...

03:48.294 --> 03:49.379
don't you think
that the subject matter

03:49.435 --> 03:50.501
is a little inappropriate?

03:50.503 --> 03:51.637
Well, that depends on

03:51.671 --> 03:53.599
what Puck's intent was
when he chose this song.

03:58.985 --> 04:01.314
I guess I just,
uh, dig Van Halen.

04:01.348 --> 04:02.553
All right!

04:02.620 --> 04:03.949
Rock on!

04:04.983 --> 04:06.461
Yep, good job, guys.

04:06.462 --> 04:07.962
Glee S03E06 "Mash Off"

04:07.963 --> 04:09.629
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

04:09.648 --> 04:11.986
<i>Burt Hummel...
he's running for Congress.</i>

04:12.020 --> 04:13.653
<i>Last year,
he had a heart attack.</i>

04:13.687 --> 04:15.073
<i>He might have had
a heart transplant.</i>

04:15.123 --> 04:16.952
<i>And he might have got it
from a baboon.</i>

04:18.745 --> 04:20.579
<i>Baboons are dangerous killers</i>

04:20.646 --> 04:22.575
who throtheir own feces
when they're not tearing off

04:22.626 --> 04:26.126
people's faces or admiring
their own weird butts.

04:26.161 --> 04:27.545
<i>Congress is bad enough.</i>

04:27.580 --> 04:29.541
<i>If Burt Hummel thinks
what Washington needs is</i>

04:29.549 --> 04:32.226
<i>more baboon parts, then
he needs a brain transplant.</i>

04:32.253 --> 04:34.006
Watch out, baboons.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.508
Burt Hummel
and his baboon heart.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.582
Wrong on the issues,
wrong for Ohio.

04:37.835 --> 04:39.104
I'm Sue Sylvester.

04:39.209 --> 04:41.679
I have a human heart,
and I approve this mes...

04:41.713 --> 04:43.686
The man had angioplasty!

04:43.720 --> 04:45.021
She's telling lies!

04:45.055 --> 04:46.652
She's playing dirty
and she's getting away with it!

04:46.696 --> 04:48.109
Okay. Will, breathe deep,
breathe deep, breathe deep.

04:48.152 --> 04:50.030
We have to play nice.

04:50.064 --> 04:53.287
Because if you win by fighting
dirty, it's not really winning.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.955
That's what we
teach our students.

04:54.957 --> 04:55.928
Right?

04:58.580 --> 04:59.836
What you're doing is appalling.

04:59.873 --> 05:01.841
Do you know
20% of all voters think

05:01.870 --> 05:03.240
my dad actually has
a baboon heart.

05:03.254 --> 05:05.502
It's not personal,
Porcelain, it's politics.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.549
And politics are

05:06.583 --> 05:08.008
all about playing dirty.

05:08.036 --> 05:10.002
You should know.

05:10.039 --> 05:12.358
Your squeaky-clean campaign
for class president

05:12.374 --> 05:14.877
is getting a good ol' fashioned
country shellackin'.

05:14.911 --> 05:16.095
Yo, fellow Americans.

05:16.138 --> 05:17.134
Okay, listen.

05:17.188 --> 05:18.680
A vote for Brittany
is a vote for

05:18.716 --> 05:20.350
root beer water fountains
and robot teachers.

05:20.385 --> 05:21.605
Did you say "robot teachers"?

05:21.641 --> 05:22.599
Yep.
Radical!

05:22.642 --> 05:23.608
I've always wanted one.

05:23.639 --> 05:24.930
And also, listen.

05:24.947 --> 05:28.316
Rachel Berry is still on MySpace
and thus unfit to lead.

05:28.367 --> 05:29.623
That's ridiculous.

05:29.643 --> 05:31.401
Brittany's making promises
shcan't deliver on.

05:31.435 --> 05:34.034
It's lying! And no one is even
on MySpace, not even Rachel!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.045
It doesn't matter.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.382
Brittany's got their attention.

05:36.416 --> 05:38.419
And you're playing all nice,
campaigning for

05:38.453 --> 05:40.208
a salad bar in the cafeteria.

05:40.246 --> 05:42.664
It's boring, it's tired, it's
not going to get you elected.

05:42.712 --> 05:44.410
Well, obesity is a huge problem
at this school.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.625
Especially in the Gleelub.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.171
Have a seat, Yasser.

05:47.173 --> 05:48.550
You know why I fight dirty?

05:48.584 --> 05:50.002
Because I'm fighting

05:50.047 --> 05:51.145
for something.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.792
I have a cause,
several actually.

05:53.822 --> 05:55.448
I hate the arts...

05:55.450 --> 05:56.906
and a bunch of other stuff.

05:56.952 --> 06:00.622
If you want to win, find
yourself a cause, my friend.

06:00.644 --> 06:02.426
Then start flinging poo.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.077
Winning is really about
poo flinging.

06:04.109 --> 06:05.571
I refuse to believe that.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.393
I agree that perhaps
I need a better cause,

06:07.430 --> 06:09.706
but I'm going to win this thing
without having to fling

06:09.708 --> 06:11.103
a single stinky nugget.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.828
Well, good luck with that, son
of Burt "Baboon Heart" Hummel.

06:13.860 --> 06:15.876
It's not personal.

06:19.887 --> 06:21.475
Hey, Shelby, what's up?

06:21.494 --> 06:22.615
We haven't talked since

06:22.755 --> 06:24.713
Mercedes and Santana
and Brittany

06:24.784 --> 06:26.176
left New Directions.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.460
I hope you know, I kept my word.

06:28.494 --> 06:29.637
I know.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.633
You didn't recruit anyone.

06:30.667 --> 06:31.938
It was, it was me.

06:31.981 --> 06:33.098
They left because of me.

06:33.148 --> 06:34.679
No, no, it's not your fault.

06:34.801 --> 06:36.514
They're talented.
They just want a chance

06:36.533 --> 06:38.146
to take center stage
during their senior year.

06:39.169 --> 06:40.403
Did you get your letter today?

06:40.506 --> 06:41.895
About Sectionals? Yeah.

06:41.897 --> 06:43.400
Figures we'd be up against you.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.288
Don't forget
the Dulcet Dazzlers.

06:46.303 --> 06:47.356
So lame.

06:49.734 --> 06:52.800
You know, we may get
along, but the kids won't.

06:52.976 --> 06:55.414
I mean, it's going to
get ugly around here.

06:55.471 --> 06:57.921
It's the last year for a lot
of them and they want to win.

06:57.923 --> 06:59.684
Well, maybe competition will
bring out the best in them.

06:59.718 --> 07:01.252
Or maybe it'll turn
into World War Glee.

07:03.143 --> 07:04.725
We usually do mash-ups
around this time.

07:04.744 --> 07:06.046
It's always my favorite.

07:06.048 --> 07:08.059
Everyone's so happy.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.602
So, you can still do it.

07:09.648 --> 07:11.501
You know, maybe there's a way

07:11.535 --> 07:13.634
to work with
all this fighting spirit.

07:13.681 --> 07:17.886
Get the kids to channel it
into something great.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.135
Talk to me.

07:22.092 --> 07:23.138
What are you doing here?

07:23.175 --> 07:24.838
Shelby told us she had
something to show us.

07:24.872 --> 07:25.878
What are you doing here?

07:25.898 --> 07:27.557
Mr. Shue said the same thing.

07:27.601 --> 07:30.605
Let me guess, he wants to
combine choirs for Sectionals.

07:30.660 --> 07:31.515
Well, it's not gonna happen.

07:31.549 --> 07:32.898
The Trouble Tones
are here to stay.

07:32.943 --> 07:34.236
So why don't you shuffle

07:34.270 --> 07:35.829
your busted choir
off our stage.

07:35.858 --> 07:37.454
Look, you guys, we can compete
without being enemies.

07:37.487 --> 07:38.911
All right?
We don't have to get vicious.

07:38.941 --> 07:40.702
Oh, I think we do, Soft Serve.

07:40.736 --> 07:44.448
fierce, femme, phenomenal.

07:44.504 --> 07:46.778
Oh, and, guys, hurry up,
go get some moist towels.

07:46.831 --> 07:49.083
We have to keep Finn wet before
we can roll him back in the sea.

07:49.116 --> 07:51.697
Okay, you know what, Santana,
Finn is in great shape,

07:51.731 --> 07:53.072
and your meanness
only highlights

07:53.083 --> 07:54.417
your own personal insecurities.

07:54.455 --> 07:56.075
And, Rachel,
your mustache is thicker

07:56.088 --> 07:57.424
than a Middle Eastern
dictator's.

08:01.544 --> 08:04.470
¶ It's been a long time since
I came around ¶

08:04.516 --> 08:08.097
¶ It's been a long time
but I'm backn town ¶

08:08.140 --> 08:12.316
¶ This time, I'm not leaving
without you ¶

08:12.356 --> 08:15.137
Is this what having a stroke
feels like?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.617
Because I like it.

08:16.652 --> 08:19.936
¶ Just you and I

08:19.953 --> 08:23.782
¶ Sharing our love together

08:23.815 --> 08:26.454
¶ And I know in time

08:26.489 --> 08:30.442
¶ We'll build the dreams
we treasure ¶

08:30.456 --> 08:33.873
¶ We'll be all right,
just you and I ¶

08:33.909 --> 08:37.336
¶ Something, something
about this place ¶

08:37.386 --> 08:40.830
¶ Just you and, just you and I

08:40.886 --> 08:43.972
¶ Something 'bout
lonely nights ¶

08:44.008 --> 08:46.173
¶ And my lipstick on your face

08:46.221 --> 08:48.087
¶ Just you and I

08:48.121 --> 08:50.642
¶ Something, somethg about

08:50.684 --> 08:53.566
¶ My cool Nebraska guy

08:53.598 --> 08:54.511
¶ You and I

08:54.563 --> 08:56.484
¶ Yeah, something about

08:56.517 --> 08:58.491
¶ Baby, you and I

09:00.236 --> 09:03.437
¶ Oh, you and I

09:03.471 --> 09:07.077
¶ Remember our first embrace

09:07.107 --> 09:11.244
¶ The smile
that was on your face ¶

09:11.288 --> 09:14.448
¶ The promises that we made

09:14.482 --> 09:16.752
¶ Ooh

09:16.785 --> 09:21.177
¶ And now your love
is my reward ¶

09:21.206 --> 09:24.874
¶ And I love you even more

09:24.934 --> 09:27.265
¶ Than I ever did before

09:27.298 --> 09:31.351
¶ Something, something
about this place ¶

09:31.386 --> 09:34.937
¶ Just you and, just you and I

09:34.969 --> 09:37.613
¶ Something 'bout
lonely nights ¶

09:37.645 --> 09:39.941
¶ And my lipstick on your face

09:39.976 --> 09:42.119
¶ Just you and I

09:42.150 --> 09:45.656
¶ Something, something about

09:45.690 --> 09:48.489
¶ My cool Nebraska guy
¶ I love you, you and I

09:48.523 --> 09:49.866
¶ Put your drinks up

09:49.908 --> 09:51.909
¶ For Nebraska ¶ For Nebraska

09:51.961 --> 09:53.409
¶ For Nebraska, Nebraska

09:53.454 --> 09:54.659
¶ I love you

09:54.693 --> 09:57.992
¶ You and I

09:58.026 --> 10:00.793
¶ You, you and I

10:00.837 --> 10:01.913
¶ Nebraska

10:01.965 --> 10:04.923
¶ I'd rather die

10:04.972 --> 10:09.976
¶ Without you and I

10:10.010 --> 10:11.709
¶ We made it

10:11.722 --> 10:16.982
¶ You and I.

10:18.851 --> 10:21.902
Mr. Shue, Shelby, I
think we can all admit

10:21.935 --> 10:24.193
that that was weirdly amazing.

10:24.227 --> 10:25.867
Buwhat exactly was the point?

10:25.901 --> 10:29.442
That sometimes bringing
together two conflicting things

10:29.499 --> 10:31.119
can create something
totally unexpected.

10:31.176 --> 10:32.791
We're not combining
Glee Clubs, Mr. Shue.

10:32.842 --> 10:34.206
That's not what
I'm talking about.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.865
Shelby and I agree
that with Sectionals

10:35.899 --> 10:38.790
coming up for both of us,
it's time we all got serious

10:38.843 --> 10:40.582
with some friendly competition.

10:40.622 --> 10:41.700
Each group's going to

10:41.734 --> 10:43.187
put together their own mash-up

10:43.215 --> 10:44.174
to perform head-to-head.

10:44.206 --> 10:45.222
For the first annual

10:45.256 --> 10:47.123
McKinley High Mash-Off.
Mash-Off.

10:47.177 --> 10:48.679
Yeah!
Come on, now.

10:50.523 --> 10:52.433
Get you some!
Let's do this!

10:52.474 --> 10:53.889
That's pretty good, right?

10:58.393 --> 11:00.271
¶

11:05.147 --> 11:07.698
They were out of apples in
the cafeteria.

11:07.732 --> 11:10.006
Thank you.

11:10.040 --> 11:10.865
I want you.

11:10.899 --> 11:12.917
I'm your teacher.

11:12.938 --> 11:13.917
You're my sub.

11:13.951 --> 11:15.419
You can't deny the chemistry.

11:17.414 --> 11:19.338
I'm not some kid. I'm 18.

11:19.368 --> 11:21.509
I've already been
with a lot of older women.

11:21.538 --> 11:24.045
Look, Noah, you
are very charming

11:24.079 --> 11:25.299
and surprisingly set.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.370
The kiss was a mistake.

11:27.404 --> 11:29.344
Well, that mistake meant
something to me.

11:29.390 --> 11:31.795
I felt something
I've never felt before.

11:31.866 --> 11:33.378
I'm in love with you.

11:33.380 --> 11:34.296
Oh, God.

11:34.353 --> 11:35.712
Wait. I made a list

11:35.746 --> 11:37.211
of the reasons
we should be together.

11:37.245 --> 11:38.858
you're hot.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.285
I'm hot.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.804
Beth needs a dad.

11:44.882 --> 11:47.124
And why shouldn't it
be her actual dad?

11:47.328 --> 11:50.123
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't feel something, too.

11:50.149 --> 11:51.576
You want a mash-up?

11:51.610 --> 11:53.470
We're the ultimate mash-up;

11:53.504 --> 11:56.759
two things that maybe shouldn't
work together but do.

11:56.793 --> 11:58.446
I would lose my job.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.006
Only if I told,
and I never would.

12:00.054 --> 12:01.090
You have a crush.

12:01.124 --> 12:02.494
It's sweet and it's normal

12:02.544 --> 12:04.003
and you're gonna get over it.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.727
I dream about us
being together.

12:05.924 --> 12:08.661
A real family.
Taking stupid pictures

12:08.718 --> 12:10.008
for our Hanukkah cards,

12:10.089 --> 12:12.109
renting an RV and all of us
hitting Coachella.

12:12.143 --> 12:14.200
What's up with
that crib you ordered?

12:14.317 --> 12:16.604
Is it still in pieces all over
your living room floor? Yes.

12:16.638 --> 12:19.100
See? You need me. I can help you
with stuff like that.

12:19.134 --> 12:20.499
Let me take care of it
this week.

12:20.672 --> 12:23.239
No, that's not gonna happen.
Why?

12:23.278 --> 12:24.980
Because you're afraid you won't
be able to resist me?

12:25.019 --> 12:26.447
I know that's why
you haven't had me

12:26.481 --> 12:28.015
back to babysit
since we made out.

12:31.066 --> 12:33.753
You know this is gonna happen.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.773
Okay, guys, we have our work cut out
for us this week with this mash-off.

12:40.094 --> 12:41.848
And The Trouble Tones have a
lot of powerful voices,

12:41.907 --> 12:44.359
so song selection is key
here. Any suggestions?

12:44.411 --> 12:45.862
What about The Clash?
Uh, The Police?

12:45.905 --> 12:46.944
REM!
No.

12:46.978 --> 12:47.807
Spice Girls.
Jonas Brothers.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.136
Guys, no, no, we can't use

12:49.159 --> 12:50.164
any of those bands.

12:50.196 --> 12:51.209
The only thing
they have in common

12:51.250 --> 12:52.972
is that they all broke up,

12:52.974 --> 12:55.677
and right now the New Directions
need to feel united.

12:55.711 --> 12:57.050
I like what you're saying, Finn.

12:57.084 --> 12:58.600
It's not just about the music,
but where it comes from.

12:58.618 --> 13:00.101
Who do you think we should use?

13:00.103 --> 13:02.629
How about this?
People think Hall and Oates are

13:02.663 --> 13:04.295
famous for their
cool, puffy hair

13:04.329 --> 13:06.257
and that dude's banging 'stache.
Awesome.

13:06.292 --> 13:07.418
But also they're awesome

13:07.463 --> 13:09.200
for staying together
over the long haul.

13:09.234 --> 13:12.453
Just like us, despite
all their differences.

13:12.455 --> 13:15.361
I think we should give
the solo to the new guy.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.939
Get him prepared
for what's in store

13:16.965 --> 13:18.109
when the stakes get high.

13:18.143 --> 13:20.348
Rory, I think
you'll do a good job.

13:20.397 --> 13:24.768
Thanks, Finn, but I don't think I'm
ready for that honor just yet.

13:24.770 --> 13:28.031
Come on.
You're totally ready, Rory.

13:28.065 --> 13:30.703
You'll kill it.
We'll all help you.

13:30.705 --> 13:32.404
It's a great idea, Finn.

13:32.406 --> 13:34.486
Thanks.

13:34.502 --> 13:35.681
I'm losing patience.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.496
Why hasn't Child Protective
Services done anything

13:37.530 --> 13:38.697
to Shelby yet?
I don't know.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.540
Wait. Did you do something
to screw this up already?

13:40.574 --> 13:42.529
You have to be
extra nice to Shelby

13:42.539 --> 13:43.747
so that we can babysit more

13:43.792 --> 13:45.162
because we've hardly
been over there,

13:45.196 --> 13:46.861
and we need to spend
as much time bonding

13:46.888 --> 13:49.225
with our baby as we can
so that when I get her,

13:49.337 --> 13:50.704
she doesn't freak out
when I hold her.

13:50.725 --> 13:51.930
I'm being really nice
to her, believe me.

13:51.978 --> 13:53.999
Look, this isn't a game, okay?

13:54.175 --> 13:55.770
I know Shelby's
threatened by me.

13:55.821 --> 13:58.123
But I am willing to do whatever
it takes to get closer to her

13:58.317 --> 14:00.954
because closer to
her is closer to Beth.

14:08.555 --> 14:10.275
I would like
to join the Trouble Tones.

14:10.343 --> 14:12.777
I have to think about that.

14:12.848 --> 14:14.947
<i>Thanks a million, Finn.</i>

14:15.020 --> 14:17.024
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

14:17.058 --> 14:18.079
I have your back.

14:18.122 --> 14:19.896
Like when that girl
with the lips was saying

14:19.918 --> 14:22.679
you look like a whale, I wanted to
tell her that I think you look fine.

14:22.714 --> 14:23.879
I'm just sick of her

14:23.913 --> 14:25.458
talking smack
about me, you know?

14:25.510 --> 14:27.759
Have you ever heard
of the term "trash talk"?

14:27.803 --> 14:29.588
Is that when you discuss trash?

14:29.618 --> 14:32.078
No. In sports, it's when
one player insults another

14:32.091 --> 14:33.849
to try and get them off
their game.

14:33.876 --> 14:35.210
And Santana's trying
to demean us

14:35.259 --> 14:37.930
to get inside of our heads
so that we remain losers.

14:37.968 --> 14:40.132
Well, it's time to start
getting inside of hers.

14:40.194 --> 14:41.889
Hey there, Orca.

14:41.923 --> 14:45.540
Hey, Santana, you look
like an ass-less J.Lo.

14:45.564 --> 14:47.921
You're skinny
like all the crops

14:47.923 --> 14:49.149
failed on your family's farm.

14:49.216 --> 14:50.424
That is the lamest
thing I didn't

14:50.446 --> 14:52.233
understand a word of.
Not one word.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.287
Is that really all that
you can come up with?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.152
You seriously think that
you can out-insult me?

14:56.200 --> 14:59.283
I'm from Lima Heights.
I was raised on insults.

14:59.285 --> 15:01.243
<i>It's how mi abuela put
me to sleep at night,</i>

15:01.245 --> 15:02.406
and she is not a nice lady.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.263
You know, she tried
to sell me once?

15:04.297 --> 15:05.795
And it wasn't till I got
to kindergarten

15:05.836 --> 15:07.335
that I learned my name
wasn't "Garbage Face."

15:07.337 --> 15:09.319
Then we'll have
to settle this another way.

15:09.353 --> 15:11.737
Uh, today, after school.

15:11.773 --> 15:13.175
Bring your Trouble Tones.

15:13.231 --> 15:15.648
Are you suggesting
what I think you are?

15:15.683 --> 15:16.603
Yeah, I am.

15:16.692 --> 15:17.989
Dodgeball.

15:24.597 --> 15:26.659
Hey, Rachel.

15:26.684 --> 15:27.850
Hi.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.794
As you might have heard,

15:29.822 --> 15:31.659
I'm applying to the New York
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.658
Ugh! All the girls who
beat me out in the auditions

15:33.694 --> 15:35.488
when I was in New York,
they all graduated from there.

15:35.523 --> 15:36.650
Well, my grades are perfect,

15:36.667 --> 15:38.276
and I was the
lead in the school musical

15:38.454 --> 15:40.196
and I plan on winning
the election

15:40.266 --> 15:41.600
for student class president,

15:41.648 --> 15:44.740
so I just need a letter, a
killer letter of recommendation.

15:44.742 --> 15:47.296
Wait. You're asking me
to write it?

15:47.330 --> 15:49.878
Actually, I've, I've
already written it,

15:49.880 --> 15:52.855
so all you would have to do is
just sign, and my resumé's

15:52.889 --> 15:54.378
in there as well
with the letter, so...

15:54.438 --> 15:56.555
I thought that, you know,
your pedigree

15:56.599 --> 15:58.240
as a National Champion
show-choir coach

15:58.274 --> 16:01.054
would just make some noise with
the admissions committee.

16:01.165 --> 16:02.182
Makes sense.

16:04.449 --> 16:06.097
Okay.

16:06.187 --> 16:08.110
Okay. Bye.

16:09.852 --> 16:12.397
I'm so proud of you.

16:13.661 --> 16:16.409
You are truly a star, Rachel.

16:18.097 --> 16:21.225
And it's all stillut
there in front of you.

16:21.227 --> 16:22.870
I'm not going to be
the first person

16:22.994 --> 16:25.155
to be a little jealous
of all the amazing things

16:25.189 --> 16:26.753
you have lying ahead.

16:26.812 --> 16:31.093
I'm just going to be the only
one who's also cheering you on.

16:33.884 --> 16:36.843
Maybe you could come
to my Broadway debut.

16:36.877 --> 16:40.072
Ooh, don't try to stop me.

16:45.620 --> 16:49.250
Maybe you could write your own
version of the letter.

16:54.646 --> 16:57.535
It's such an impressive resumé.

16:57.569 --> 17:02.294
You have the musical and all
the clubs and... maybe even

17:02.328 --> 17:03.715
Student Council president.

17:03.749 --> 17:07.267
I feel bad for all the kids
that don't have these

17:07.303 --> 17:09.589
big-ticket items in their CVs.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.943
They don't have a chance in
hell of getting into NYADA.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.210
This could be deadly.
I mean, facing our foes head-on

17:18.214 --> 17:20.007
without any adult supervision?

17:22.486 --> 17:26.000
So, uh, you know that our NYADA
applications are due next week.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.968
I only need one more letter
of recommendation.

17:28.856 --> 17:30.160
I wrote to Patti
LuPone on her Web site,

17:30.173 --> 17:32.173
but I haven't heard
from her yet, so...

17:36.848 --> 17:40.952
I-I really, I... I really miss
you, Kurt.

17:41.986 --> 17:43.099
And I just...

17:43.101 --> 17:46.036
I just... I really want
to be your friend again.

17:46.096 --> 17:47.662
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

17:47.670 --> 17:48.980
before you walked all over me

17:49.014 --> 17:51.487
in your borderline-sociopathic
climb to the top.

17:54.425 --> 17:55.505
Let's roadhouse!

17:55.516 --> 17:57.465
Oh, it's on,
Pillsbury Dough Turd.

17:57.499 --> 17:58.861
Excuse me.

17:58.897 --> 18:00.428
I've never heard of this game
of dodging balls before.

18:00.469 --> 18:02.891
What's the rules?
Don't die.

18:05.889 --> 18:07.359
Let's do this.

18:13.784 --> 18:16.120
¶ Hit me with your best shot

18:16.159 --> 18:18.514
¶ Why don't you hit me
with your best shot? ¶

18:18.546 --> 18:20.688
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

18:20.700 --> 18:22.685
¶ Hit me with your best shot

18:22.703 --> 18:24.689
¶ Fire away

18:24.704 --> 18:27.156
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

18:27.190 --> 18:31.545
¶ One way or another,
I'm gonna find ya ¶

18:31.585 --> 18:33.697
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

18:33.717 --> 18:38.705
¶ One way or another
I'm gonna win ya ¶

18:38.723 --> 18:40.646
¶ I'll getcha, I'll getcha

18:40.679 --> 18:43.473
¶ You're a real tough cookie
with a long history ¶

18:43.512 --> 18:46.711
¶ Of breaking little hearts
like the one in me ¶

18:46.727 --> 18:50.992
¶ That's okay, let's see
how you do it ¶

18:51.015 --> 18:53.984
¶ Put up your dukes,
let's get down to it ¶

18:54.018 --> 18:56.359
¶ Hit me with your best shot

18:56.393 --> 18:58.890
¶ Why don't you hit me
with your best shot? ¶

18:58.913 --> 19:01.001
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

19:01.032 --> 19:03.172
¶ Hit me with your best shot

19:03.196 --> 19:04.897
¶ Fire away!

19:04.917 --> 19:07.406
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

19:07.418 --> 19:14.404
¶ And if the lights
are all out ¶

19:14.432 --> 19:19.842
¶ I'll follow your bus
downtown ¶

19:19.886 --> 19:25.247
¶ See who's hanging out

19:27.773 --> 19:29.690
¶ Hit me with your best shot

19:29.725 --> 19:32.361
¶ Fire away

19:32.388 --> 19:34.148
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

19:34.197 --> 19:38.127
¶ Hit me with your best shot,
fire away ¶

19:38.148 --> 19:40.898
¶ I'm gonna getcha, getcha,
getcha, getcha ¶

19:40.932 --> 19:43.198
¶ Hit me with your best shot.

19:47.744 --> 19:49.330
Okay. Good game.

19:50.775 --> 19:51.785
Boy, oh, boy,
that was a cracker!

19:51.802 --> 19:53.416
What?

19:53.450 --> 19:54.505
Whoa!

19:57.947 --> 19:59.421
Stop it! Stop it!

19:59.455 --> 20:01.951
For God's sakes, he's bleeding!

20:01.972 --> 20:03.848
Maybe that's how the others
treat us around here,

20:03.893 --> 20:05.759
but we don't do this
to each other!

20:05.793 --> 20:07.014
We're better than this!

20:07.068 --> 20:08.891
God, calm down, Grandma.

20:08.939 --> 20:09.685
The game's over!

20:11.306 --> 20:13.158
We still won.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.783
Ladies,
vocal warm-ups can wait.

20:21.817 --> 20:23.807
Now, I was up half the night
thinking

20:23.831 --> 20:25.165
about our mash-up
for the mash-off,

20:25.200 --> 20:27.159
and it came to me... Adele.

20:27.205 --> 20:28.580
I sound just like her.

20:28.622 --> 20:30.112
Dude, I love her.
She sounds like

20:30.146 --> 20:31.918
what banana cream pie sounds
like when it sings.

20:31.951 --> 20:33.306
I think it's a great idea,
Mercedes.

20:33.340 --> 20:34.872
I think that we could really
kill with that stuff.

20:34.921 --> 20:36.984
Agreed. And now with that
decision out of the way,

20:36.986 --> 20:38.821
I can stay focused on
my one-sided battle

20:38.823 --> 20:40.124
of wits with
the knuckle-dragger.

20:40.158 --> 20:43.023
Santana, the dodgeball thing was
fun, until the end, but enough.

20:43.057 --> 20:44.856
No, honey, I'm
just getting started.

20:44.893 --> 20:47.058
I'm the leader of this group
and I'm telling you

20:47.060 --> 20:48.193
lay off those guys.

20:48.228 --> 20:49.773
I'm sorry.
The leader?

20:49.808 --> 20:52.722
Who died and
made you queen, Aretha?

20:52.776 --> 20:53.942
I brought you guys in

20:53.982 --> 20:56.283
and I came up with the
idea for our mash-up

20:56.310 --> 20:58.139
while you were wasting time
trying to figure out how

20:58.173 --> 20:59.408
to make Finn Hudson cry.

20:59.461 --> 21:02.527
So I nominate myself as
President of the Trouble Tones.

21:02.571 --> 21:04.490
All in favor?

21:04.524 --> 21:06.464
I'm not impressed
by your campaign.

21:06.488 --> 21:07.664
You didn't put any posters up.

21:07.698 --> 21:09.994
Four in favor means
Mercedes gets elected.

21:10.028 --> 21:11.875
And she's right.
We should all be focusg

21:11.906 --> 21:14.322
on winning because
we're better, not meaner.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.170
Mr. Shue and I both agreed on
the ground rules.

21:16.204 --> 21:17.717
We play fair.

21:17.747 --> 21:19.296
I just don't have time
for this kind of thinking.

21:19.337 --> 21:20.750
Well, make time.

21:20.799 --> 21:22.916
Because you are a star member
of this group

21:22.979 --> 21:24.926
and you need to represent.

21:26.432 --> 21:28.550
¶ Stop the violence.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.707
Come on.
Okay. God, okay.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.152
Look, I'll play fair.

21:34.195 --> 21:36.389
From now on, I will be so nice

21:36.404 --> 21:39.034
that cotton candy won't
melt in my mouth.

21:39.068 --> 21:40.739
That's really nice.
That's really nice.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.659
Hey, Tubs, can I talk
to you for a second?

21:44.689 --> 21:45.699
Hey, listen here.

21:45.733 --> 21:47.202
You can't make fun
of Finn anymore.

21:47.236 --> 21:49.543
Shut your potato hole.
I'm here to apologize.

21:49.577 --> 21:51.919
Rachel's right.
I haven't been fair to you.

21:51.946 --> 21:53.883
You're not fat.

21:53.917 --> 21:57.382
I should know, I slept with you.
I mean, at some point,

21:57.416 --> 21:59.345
I must have liked that
you look like a taco addict

21:59.377 --> 22:02.018
who's had one-too-many
back-alley liposuctions. Whoa.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.134
Please stick a sock in it

22:03.173 --> 22:04.526
or ship yourself
back to Scotland.

22:04.554 --> 22:07.019
I'm trying to apologize
to Lumps the Clown.

22:07.079 --> 22:08.062
I am sorry, Finn.

22:08.096 --> 22:09.552
I mean, really, I'm-I'm sorry

22:09.586 --> 22:11.553
that the New Directions
are going to get cshed

22:11.587 --> 22:13.241
by the Trouble Tones.

22:13.275 --> 22:15.255
I'm so sorry
that you have no talent.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.782
I'm sorry that you sing
like you're getting

22:16.815 --> 22:19.562
your prostate checked
and you dance like you've been

22:19.596 --> 22:23.127
asleep for years
and someone just woke you up.

22:23.151 --> 22:24.461
Have fun riding on
Rachel's coattails

22:24.656 --> 22:25.878
for the rest of your life.

22:25.922 --> 22:28.114
Although, you know what,
I would just watch out for her

22:28.159 --> 22:29.446
come holiday time,
if I were him,

22:29.468 --> 22:30.915
because if I were her, I'd stick

22:30.949 --> 22:33.479
a stent in one of those boobs
and let the Finn blubber

22:33.514 --> 22:36.667
light the Hanukkah lamp
for eight magical nights.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.458
Hey, Santana.

22:39.467 --> 22:42.830
Why don't u just
come out of the closet?

22:42.886 --> 22:44.919
You know, I think I know why

22:44.953 --> 22:47.665
you're so good at
tearing everybody else down.

22:47.731 --> 22:49.003
It's because you're constantly

22:49.051 --> 22:51.143
tearing yourself down,
because you can't admit

22:51.171 --> 22:52.921
to everybody that
you're in love with Brittany

22:52.955 --> 22:54.643
and she might not love you back.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.571
That must hurt,
to not be able to

22:57.615 --> 22:59.979
admit to everyone
how you really feel.

23:00.023 --> 23:02.246
You know what I think you are?

23:03.337 --> 23:06.031
A coward.

23:06.033 --> 23:08.029
See you at the mash-off.

23:12.115 --> 23:14.237
<i>Burt Hummel claims he doesn't
have a baboon heart.</i>

23:14.240 --> 23:17.141
<i>He also claims he isn't married
to a donkey.</i>

23:17.190 --> 23:18.521
Well, which is it, Burt Hummel?

23:18.570 --> 23:19.891
<i>Baboon heart or donkey bride?</i>

23:19.925 --> 23:22.041
Donkeys have no place
in politics.

23:22.075 --> 23:25.210
They bite off children's fingers
and pee absolutely anywhere.

23:25.244 --> 23:27.062
Do we really need
another Washington politician

23:27.205 --> 23:28.620
married to a pack animal?

23:28.622 --> 23:31.250
Don't let Burt Hummel
make an ass out of you, Ohio.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.715
I'm Sue Sylvester,
and it's not personal.

23:33.749 --> 23:35.831
Will, you are my
campaign manager.

23:35.891 --> 23:38.043
You have got to do
something about this!

23:38.077 --> 23:39.417
She's killing us!

23:39.451 --> 23:41.629
You are on the right side of
the issues voters care about.

23:41.631 --> 23:43.640
You know what it's like
to run a small business.

23:43.668 --> 23:45.381
When the recession hit,
you took a pay cut

23:45.424 --> 23:47.164
so you didn't have to fire
a single employee.

23:47.199 --> 23:48.804
Will, if you don't start
fighting fire with fire,

23:48.809 --> 23:50.168
we are both going to lose.

23:50.170 --> 23:52.172
I'm going to lose the race,

23:52.207 --> 23:54.109
you're going to lose your job.

23:54.143 --> 23:55.770
Put your thinking cap on.

23:55.804 --> 23:58.708
Oh, who's got your nose?

23:58.745 --> 24:00.444
Where'd it go?

24:00.478 --> 24:01.490
Huh?

24:01.593 --> 24:02.719
There it is!

24:02.721 --> 24:04.915
It's magic!

24:05.124 --> 24:06.811
Yeah.

24:08.861 --> 24:10.811
Sorry, I should probably
be helping more.

24:10.827 --> 24:13.215
I didn't know the directions
were gonna be the foreign kind

24:13.266 --> 24:14.591
with weird pictures
instead of English.

24:14.593 --> 24:16.118
It's okay.

24:17.591 --> 24:20.049
She likes you.
You're good with her.

24:20.083 --> 24:23.501
That's 'cause she's the best
little girl in the whole world.

24:23.608 --> 24:24.692
Whoa!

24:24.726 --> 24:26.991
Oh, where'd it go?

24:28.858 --> 24:30.306
Isn't that right, Monkeyface?

24:32.831 --> 24:33.947
Can I have her for a sec?

24:33.977 --> 24:34.936
Sure.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.332
Go see Mama.

24:36.349 --> 24:37.672
Hi. Hi.
That's a good girl.

24:37.694 --> 24:41.116
Want to play here
and give Mommy a little break?

24:41.143 --> 24:43.247
I got to come clean
about something.

24:43.297 --> 24:46.522
When Quinn and I
babysat for you,

24:46.532 --> 24:48.353
she put a bunch of stuff
around here

24:48.379 --> 24:50.255
to make you look like
an unfit mother.

24:52.062 --> 24:53.811
And then she called
Child Protective Services.

24:53.845 --> 24:55.602
But I came
and got rid of it all.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.848
Why would she do that to me?

24:57.882 --> 24:59.130
Because she wants
to get Beth back again.

24:59.132 --> 25:00.260
I did, too.

25:00.294 --> 25:01.334
I thought we'd be,

25:01.368 --> 25:02.824
you know, good parents.

25:02.858 --> 25:05.575
It was wrong and stupid
and totally selfish.

25:05.643 --> 25:08.583
I'm really, really sorry.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.669
I...

25:14.879 --> 25:18.910
I always thought of Beth
as an accident.

25:18.912 --> 25:20.409
But she's no accident.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.908
Quinn and I gave her life...

25:27.291 --> 25:31.661
but somehow God or nature
or whatever

25:31.663 --> 25:34.872
meant for you and her
to be together.

25:34.906 --> 25:37.589
You were always
meant to be her mother.

25:40.890 --> 25:43.303
And I'd like to be
part of her life, too.

25:47.505 --> 25:50.164
Hi.

25:52.106 --> 25:55.409
Welcome, everyone, to day one
of the first annual

25:55.437 --> 25:57.518
McKinley High Mash-Off!

25:59.821 --> 26:01.974
Okay, a couple of ground rules.

26:02.035 --> 26:03.603
Everyone, therwill be

26:03.776 --> 26:05.272
no heckling of any kind, okay?

26:05.304 --> 26:07.478
Ms. Corcoran, the Trouble Tones
are all fired up.

26:07.529 --> 26:09.541
Fine, fine.

26:09.573 --> 26:11.402
Don't worry, I can do it.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.452
I'm gonna hit
that F below middle C,

26:13.495 --> 26:14.558
just like Adele.

26:14.592 --> 26:16.094
All right, here we go.

26:16.129 --> 26:17.600
Finn will represent
the New Directions;

26:17.618 --> 26:20.482
Santana, the Trouble Tones
for the rock-paper-scissor

26:20.542 --> 26:23.322
face-off to see who will
perform first, all right?

26:23.378 --> 26:25.537
Let's get it going!

26:25.574 --> 26:27.219
Let's do this.

26:27.249 --> 26:29.051
One, two, three!

26:29.090 --> 26:30.917
Yeah! Yeah!

26:30.951 --> 26:31.967
Okay, paper covers rock.

26:32.001 --> 26:33.386
New Directions, take the stage!

26:33.419 --> 26:34.956
A kiss for the winner.

26:38.894 --> 26:41.089
¶ What I want, you've got

26:41.123 --> 26:43.073
¶ It might be hard to handle

26:43.111 --> 26:46.511
¶ Like the flame
that burns the candle ¶

26:46.562 --> 26:48.896
¶ The candle feeds the flame

26:48.938 --> 26:50.136
<i>¶ Eh, eh ¶</i>

26:50.154 --> 26:51.849
¶ What I've got's full stock

26:51.902 --> 26:54.105
¶ Of thoughts and dreams
that scatter ¶

26:54.139 --> 26:56.772
¶ You pull them all together

26:56.806 --> 26:59.283
¶ And how I can't explain

26:59.317 --> 27:01.162
¶ Oh, yeah, well, well, you

27:01.203 --> 27:02.575
¶ I can't go for that

27:02.611 --> 27:04.362
<i>¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>

27:04.410 --> 27:05.832
¶ You make my dreams come true

27:05.864 --> 27:10.034
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

27:10.086 --> 27:11.503
¶ Well, well, well, you

27:11.537 --> 27:13.623
¶ I can't go for that

27:13.625 --> 27:16.592
¶ Oh, yeah, you make my dreams
come true ¶

27:16.627 --> 27:20.601
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

27:20.635 --> 27:25.048
¶ On a night when bad dreams
become a screamer ¶

27:25.101 --> 27:27.765
¶ When they're messing
with the dreamer ¶

27:27.805 --> 27:31.474
¶ I can laugh it in the face

27:31.508 --> 27:33.388
¶ Twist and shout my way out

27:33.445 --> 27:35.606
¶ And wrap yourself around me

27:35.644 --> 27:38.646
¶ 'Cause I ain't the way
you found me ¶

27:38.680 --> 27:41.395
¶ And I'll never be the same

27:41.452 --> 27:42.849
¶ Oh, yeah, well, 'cause you

27:42.869 --> 27:44.874
<i>¶ I can't go for that
¶ Ooh, ooh ¶</i>

27:44.900 --> 27:47.407
¶ Oh, yeah, you make my dreams
come true ¶

27:47.455 --> 27:51.877
¶ I can't go for that,
I can't go for that ¶

27:51.913 --> 27:55.413
¶ Oh...

27:55.470 --> 27:57.888
¶ I'm down on my daydream

27:57.917 --> 28:00.919
¶ But that sleepwalk
should be over by now ¶

28:00.971 --> 28:02.217
¶ I know

28:02.257 --> 28:03.968
¶ Yeah, you

28:04.004 --> 28:05.719
¶ Ah

28:05.758 --> 28:08.183
¶ I'll do anything
that you want me to ¶

28:08.217 --> 28:10.759
¶ Yeah, I

28:10.811 --> 28:12.176
¶ Do almost anything

28:12.210 --> 28:14.348
¶ You make my dreams come true

28:14.382 --> 28:16.013
¶ I can't go for that

28:16.047 --> 28:18.738
¶ Oh, you make my dreams
come true ¶

28:18.772 --> 28:20.243
¶ I can't go for that

28:20.279 --> 28:25.779
¶ You make my dreams
come true. ¶

28:37.904 --> 28:38.900
Burt.

28:38.979 --> 28:40.223
Hey, I was worried you
weren't going to make it.

28:40.225 --> 28:42.032
Are you kidding?

28:42.071 --> 28:43.152
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

28:43.186 --> 28:45.368
Polls have you in first place.

28:45.403 --> 28:47.072
Almost everyone
loves the new ad.

28:47.121 --> 28:48.643
Almost everyone?

28:48.672 --> 28:49.871
Well, that ad was bulletproof.

28:49.893 --> 28:51.925
I accused Burt Hummel
of using his tire shop

28:51.989 --> 28:53.874
to sexually assault automobiles.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.296
What's not to like about that?

28:56.339 --> 28:57.749
Hey, Ms. C.

28:57.811 --> 28:59.390
Quiet, please, children.

28:59.422 --> 29:01.224
Welcome one and all

29:01.272 --> 29:04.566
to McKinley High's senior class
presidential debate.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.123
Such a magnificent
turnout reflects

29:07.175 --> 29:09.451
this school's passion
for democracy.

29:09.485 --> 29:12.735
it is against school policy

29:12.737 --> 29:16.268
to pass gas into jars
to be sold in the cafeteria.

29:16.339 --> 29:21.691
And now, our first candidate,
Rick "The Stick" Nelson.

29:23.890 --> 29:24.940
Stick! Stick! Stick! Stick!

29:26.170 --> 29:28.514
So, I was talking to my dad,

29:28.536 --> 29:30.842
who says that since he pays
taxes and stuff,

29:30.844 --> 29:34.286
like, for teachers, which pretty
much means that we're your boss.

29:34.288 --> 29:36.117
So I think it's time

29:36.221 --> 29:38.222
that the teachers started
doing what we say.

29:38.256 --> 29:40.602
And how about you stop talking
in class, Mrs. Janicek?

29:40.641 --> 29:42.458
Everything you have to say
is boring!

29:43.680 --> 29:45.287
Vote Rick the Stick!

29:45.322 --> 29:49.264
Tornadoes are nature's
most destructive force.

29:49.266 --> 29:51.225
These violent storms
have ravaged America,

29:51.306 --> 29:53.489
crippling communities
all across our land.

29:53.695 --> 29:55.793
Isn't it time we take a stand?

29:55.874 --> 29:57.948
If you honor me with being
your next class president,

29:57.981 --> 30:00.119
I will make tornadoes
illegal at McKinley,

30:00.151 --> 30:01.949
keeping you and your families
at our school

30:01.987 --> 30:04.006
safe from
their murderous rampages.

30:04.008 --> 30:08.163
Also, on Tuesdays, uh,
I pledge to go topless.

30:13.114 --> 30:14.382
Whoo!

30:23.284 --> 30:25.860
Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel.

30:26.099 --> 30:28.264
Um, the past few weeks,

30:28.352 --> 30:31.266
I've tried to address
the real problem

30:31.371 --> 30:34.040
of obesity at this school.

30:34.042 --> 30:39.310
But my opponents chose empty
promises and smear tactics.

30:39.312 --> 30:42.439
Although she knows it to be
untrue, my opponent Brittany

30:42.473 --> 30:44.618
stated that my face
was used as a template

30:44.774 --> 30:48.625
for Hasbro's successful line
of My Little Ponies.

30:48.659 --> 30:50.692
Well, I refuse to be bullied.

30:52.805 --> 30:56.155
In fact, I refuse
to let anyone be bullied.

30:56.379 --> 30:59.552
Today, I want to take it
one step further.

30:59.587 --> 31:03.546
I would like to hereby pledge
to ban dodgeball

31:03.580 --> 31:05.453
at McKinley High.

31:10.282 --> 31:14.554
Since its invention in 1831
by Silas W. Mangold,

31:14.589 --> 31:16.202
dodgeball has been used as

31:16.393 --> 31:18.566
a schoolyard instrument
of suppression.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.040
It's violent, it's painful,
it's humiliating,

31:21.074 --> 31:23.182
and I believe
that it's an equivalent

31:23.296 --> 31:24.415
to modern-day stoning.

31:24.449 --> 31:28.853
Let's end dodgeball
at Minley High

31:28.855 --> 31:32.962
and send a strong message
that violence isn't okay.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.479
Hello, I'm Rachel Berry,

31:38.492 --> 31:41.187
and I have campaigned
for president on a crusade

31:41.221 --> 31:43.185
for school book covers,

31:43.219 --> 31:45.426
a plan to save the school
thousands of dollars.

31:46.806 --> 31:47.893
Knock it off!

31:49.617 --> 31:51.394
While I still consider this plan

31:51.428 --> 31:53.841
an inspired stroke
of political genius,

31:53.875 --> 31:56.765
I hereby withdraw my candidacy

31:56.799 --> 32:00.595
and urge you all to vote
for Kurt Hummel.

32:01.873 --> 32:03.584
He's the only candidate

32:03.599 --> 32:05.082
here today who never
went negative.

32:05.257 --> 32:09.284
He-He's the one who deserves
to be president.

32:11.469 --> 32:14.369
That's why I-I'm casting my vote
for Kurt Hummel.

32:14.403 --> 32:16.669
Vote Hummel, McKinley.

32:18.736 --> 32:20.504
Vote for Kurt.

32:35.085 --> 32:36.116
Why'd you do it?

32:36.148 --> 32:38.817
I should have
withdrawn from the race

32:39.034 --> 32:40.578
when I got the lead
in the musical.

32:40.612 --> 32:42.168
You needed the resumé boost

32:42.202 --> 32:44.126
to get into NYADA.

32:44.173 --> 32:47.344
You're already so spectacular.

32:47.346 --> 32:51.534
But being senior class president
will just put you over the top.

32:51.577 --> 32:55.151
Only Rachel Berrcould perk up
an old boring high school debate

32:55.209 --> 32:56.579
with such a riveting twist.

32:56.613 --> 32:58.659
Drama queen. I know.

32:58.723 --> 33:02.569
But I just... I-I hated
you hating me.

33:02.759 --> 33:05.464
Me, too. Scowling gives
you forehead lines,

33:05.466 --> 33:08.553
and I'm way too
young for Botox.

33:08.602 --> 33:11.642
I guess I was just, you know,
focusing on my dream

33:11.644 --> 33:13.930
of going to New York and
getting into NYADA, but...

33:13.964 --> 33:17.600
then realized that part of that
dream is going there with you.

33:17.681 --> 33:20.241
So, now I am all
about helping you win.

33:20.243 --> 33:22.489
Consider me your
campaign slave.

33:25.245 --> 33:27.240
I'm gonna hug you now, okay?
Okay.

33:27.269 --> 33:28.356
Okay!

33:28.416 --> 33:30.334
Thank you!

33:35.982 --> 33:37.861
So, about the
whole pastie thing...

33:37.916 --> 33:40.164
Let's just quit while
we're ahead, doll.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.000
Hey. I was... I was in
the neighborhood,

33:47.330 --> 33:49.650
so I thought I'd drop this off
for Beth.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.235
- I just got her down so...
- I left a bunch

33:51.300 --> 33:53.863
of voicemails trying to find a
good time to come by.

33:53.896 --> 33:55.804
And you never gave me
a straight answer

33:55.838 --> 33:57.207
about when I can join
the Trouble Tones.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.231
I don't think it's
a very good idea.

33:59.348 --> 34:01.034
Well, Mr. Schuester
won't miss me.

34:01.078 --> 34:04.592
I reached out to you.

34:04.594 --> 34:06.353
I came back here so that you

34:06.355 --> 34:07.857
and my daughter could
have a relationship.

34:07.891 --> 34:11.051
Oh, please, I know all about
the hot sauce and the book

34:11.085 --> 34:12.635
and everything else
you planted here.

34:12.663 --> 34:14.812
You think they were just gonna
come here and find those things

34:14.848 --> 34:17.248
- and hand my baby over to you?
- She's my baby.

34:17.251 --> 34:19.384
You have no idea what it means
to be a mother.

34:19.397 --> 34:21.594
It's not about whose
body she comes out of;

34:21.629 --> 34:24.762
it's about accepting the fact
that you don'tatter anymore...

34:24.869 --> 34:27.679
that your feelings, and that
your life and that your body

34:27.714 --> 34:32.147
they all come second to making sure
that that child is happy and safe.

34:32.187 --> 34:33.690
Is that why you gave yours up
for money?

34:33.725 --> 34:35.790
At least I did what I
thought was best for my baby.

34:35.821 --> 34:38.270
You were just a cash whore!

34:39.827 --> 34:42.577
I don't feel comfortable with
you being around Beth anymore.

34:47.830 --> 34:49.766
Is Puck going to
get to see her?

34:51.498 --> 34:53.556
Was he the one who told you?
We're done here.

34:53.702 --> 34:56.761
I hope you this as a
wake-up call.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.795
Just because you take out
your nose ring

34:58.844 --> 35:02.638
and dye your hair blonde again
doesn't make you any less lost.

35:04.304 --> 35:06.602
I think you need to stop making
fun of Finn.

35:06.637 --> 35:07.800
You're being really harsh.

35:07.851 --> 35:09.884
Manatees have
really thick skin.

35:09.918 --> 35:13.363
Santana, Coach Sue needs you in
her office right away.

35:16.121 --> 35:17.310
What's going on?

35:17.419 --> 35:19.864
Have a seat, Santana.

35:25.121 --> 35:27.716
I'm afraid we have
some bad news,

35:27.756 --> 35:30.625
and I think I
might be to blame.

35:30.673 --> 35:32.741
Oh, you think?
Watch your blood pressure, Bubbles.

35:32.775 --> 35:35.576
In my campaign to become
Ohio's newest congresswoman,

35:35.610 --> 35:38.649
I've said some things
that are not true,

35:38.651 --> 35:41.021
and I don't feel good about it.

35:42.101 --> 35:44.308
I set the tone for this
campaign,

35:44.346 --> 35:47.064
and now I'm afraid
my slanderous chickens

35:47.091 --> 35:49.294
have come home to roost.

35:49.328 --> 35:50.806
Santana, you should know
that I have the phone number

35:50.843 --> 35:52.632
of a counselor who
specializes in this.

35:52.643 --> 35:55.122
It's something that, uh, I've
been through first-hand,

35:55.156 --> 35:57.240
and I'd be willing to talk your
family through it.

35:57.284 --> 35:58.987
What are you... What
are you talking about?

35:59.114 --> 36:01.538
Reggie "the Sauce"
Salazar sent me

36:01.593 --> 36:04.245
an advance copy of his latest
campaign ad.

36:04.271 --> 36:06.944
It turns out he has a niece
who goes to this school,

36:06.993 --> 36:08.953
and she overheard a conversati

36:08.987 --> 36:11.710
a couple of days ago
between you and Finn Hudson.

36:15.385 --> 36:17.570
<i>Sue Sylvester
wants to represent Ohio.</i>

36:17.703 --> 36:19.145
<i>She says she shares your
values.</i>

36:19.179 --> 36:21.255
<i>If that's true, boy do we have
some questions...</i>

36:21.291 --> 36:23.385
<i>If you're so into family
values, why did you promote</i>

36:23.426 --> 36:25.034
<i>a lesbian student to be
your head cheerleader?</i>

36:25.062 --> 36:27.294
<i>And when did you plan on
telling Ohio families?</i>

36:27.328 --> 36:29.967
<i>Why
don't you have a husband, Sue?</i>

36:30.001 --> 36:31.769
<i>Is there something you're not
telling us?</i>

36:31.821 --> 36:34.016
<i>Sue Sylvester.
So many questions.</i>

36:34.018 --> 36:37.487
I can't believe this
is happening.

36:37.521 --> 36:38.556
I'm so sorry.

36:38.575 --> 36:41.476
I haven't even told
my parents yet.

36:51.460 --> 36:55.162
<i>¶ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ¶</i>

36:55.196 --> 36:58.293
¶ She, she ain't real

36:58.329 --> 37:02.578
¶ She ain't gonna be able to
love you like I will ¶

37:02.643 --> 37:06.837
¶ Sure, she's got it all

37:06.871 --> 37:12.931
¶ But baby, is that really what
you want? ¶

37:16.712 --> 37:20.020
¶ Bless your soul, you've got
your head in the clouds ¶

37:20.054 --> 37:22.219
¶ You made a fool out of you

37:22.235 --> 37:24.190
¶ And, boy, she's bringing
you down ¶

37:24.224 --> 37:28.692
¶ She made your heart melt,
but you're cold to the core ¶

37:28.726 --> 37:31.415
¶ Now rumor has it she ain't got
your love anymore ¶

37:31.448 --> 37:33.195
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

37:33.229 --> 37:35.452
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

37:35.500 --> 37:37.417
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

37:37.451 --> 37:39.205
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

37:39.239 --> 37:41.339
¶ Don't forget me

37:41.375 --> 37:43.621
<i>¶ I beg ¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

37:43.681 --> 37:48.382
<i>¶ I remember, you said
¶ Rumor has it ¶</i>

37:48.416 --> 37:51.013
<i>I heard ¶
¶ Ooh... ¶</i>

37:51.049 --> 37:54.969
¶ That you settled down

37:55.020 --> 37:58.851
¶ That you found a girl

37:58.907 --> 38:04.196
¶ And you're married now

38:04.235 --> 38:06.694
<i>¶ I heard
¶ Ooh... ¶</i>

38:06.731 --> 38:11.031
¶ That your dreams came true

38:11.066 --> 38:14.438
¶ Guess she gave you things

38:14.451 --> 38:17.576
¶ I didn't give to you

38:17.610 --> 38:20.658
<i>¶ Whoa!
¶ Rumor has it, ooh</i>

38:20.714 --> 38:22.609
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

38:22.632 --> 38:25.746
<i>¶ Yeah, baby
¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

38:25.780 --> 38:27.834
¶ Don't forget me

38:27.895 --> 38:29.672
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶ ¶ I beg</i>

38:29.721 --> 38:33.393
¶ I remember, you said

38:33.423 --> 38:35.174
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh ¶</i>

38:35.229 --> 38:39.520
¶ Never mind, I'll find someone
like you ¶

38:39.574 --> 38:41.561
<i>¶ Rumor has it, ooh</i>

38:41.600 --> 38:46.239
¶ I wish nothing but the best

38:46.267 --> 38:49.492
<i>¶ For you, too ¶ Rumor has it ¶</i>

38:49.521 --> 38:51.993
¶ Don't forget me

38:52.029 --> 38:53.243
¶ I beg

38:53.279 --> 38:57.652
¶ I remember, you said

38:57.661 --> 38:59.914
¶ Sometimes it lasts in love

38:59.947 --> 39:04.793
¶ But sometimes
it hurts instead ¶

39:04.827 --> 39:09.004
¶ Sometimes it lasts
in love, but sometimes ¶

39:09.023 --> 39:14.499
¶ It hurts instead...

39:15.604 --> 39:17.167
What did you just say to her?

39:18.236 --> 39:20.660
- I said I thought you were great.
- You're lying.

39:20.661 --> 39:22.323
- No, he literally just said that.
- Did you tell her, too?

39:22.570 --> 39:23.102
Santana...

39:23.144 --> 39:24.593
Everyone's gonna know
now, because of you!

39:25.101 --> 39:27.183
The whole school already knows,
and you know what? They don't care!

39:27.185 --> 39:29.085
 Not just the school, you idiot... everyone.

39:29.086 --> 39:30.985
 What are you talking...?
