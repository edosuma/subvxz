01:37.512 --> 01:38.998
Wer...

01:40.579 --> 01:43.191
- ...are you?
- We are three wise men.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.908
- What?
- We are three wise men.

01:46.081 --> 01:49.117
What are you doing creeping around
a cowshed at 2:00 a.m.?

01:49.292 --> 01:51.249
That doesn't sound very wise to me.

01:51.795 --> 01:55.627
- We are astrologers.
- We have come from the East.

01:56.049 --> 02:00.213
- Is this some kind of joke?
- We wish to praise the infant.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.921
- We must pay a homage to him.
- Homage? You're all drunk!

02:04.099 --> 02:06.838
It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!

02:06.977 --> 02:10.262
Bursting in here with tales about
Oriental fortunetellers. Out!

02:10.479 --> 02:13.398
- No, no, we must see him.
- Go and praise someone else's brat!

02:13.567 --> 02:17.481
- We were led by a star!
- Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!

02:17.654 --> 02:20.026
- We must see him. We have presents!
- Out!

02:20.198 --> 02:22.107
Gold, frankincense, myrrh!

02:22.284 --> 02:25.320
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.

02:25.496 --> 02:28.746
Sorry the place is a bit of a mess.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.909
Well, what is myrrh anyway?

02:31.085 --> 02:33.706
- It is a valuable balm.
- A balm?!

02:33.880 --> 02:36.453
What are you giving him a balm for?
It might bite him!

02:37.258 --> 02:39.049
- What?
- That's a dangerous animal!

02:39.218 --> 02:40.926
- Throw it in the trough!
- No, it isn't!

02:41.137 --> 02:44.802
- It's a great big...
- No, no, no, it is an ointment.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.348
Well, there is an animal called
a balm, or did I dream it?

02:49.520 --> 02:53.352
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he then?

02:53.524 --> 02:56.561
What star-sign is he?

02:56.736 --> 03:00.354
- Capricorn.
- Capricorn, eh? What are they like?

03:00.531 --> 03:03.201
Well, he's the Son of God.
Our Messiah.

03:03.409 --> 03:04.524
King of the Jews!

03:04.702 --> 03:07.988
- And that's Capricorn, is it?
- No, no, no, that's just him!

03:08.164 --> 03:11.415
I was gonna say,
otherwise there'd be a lot of them.

03:11.585 --> 03:15.036
- By what name are you calling him?
- Brian.

03:15.214 --> 03:19.377
We worship you, Brian,
who are lord over us all.

03:19.843 --> 03:25.004
Praise unto you, Brian,
and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.

03:25.182 --> 03:26.676
- Do you do a lot of this?
- What?

03:26.850 --> 03:28.926
- This praising.
- No, no. No, no.

03:29.102 --> 03:31.973
Well, if you're dropping
by again, do pop in.

03:32.147 --> 03:34.852
And thanks a lot for the gold
and frankincense...

03:35.025 --> 03:38.192
...but don't worry too much about
the myrrh next time, all right?

03:38.362 --> 03:41.612
Thank you. Goodbye.

03:42.866 --> 03:44.859
Well, weren't they nice?

03:45.035 --> 03:49.329
Out of their bloody minds,
but still, look at that!

03:49.665 --> 03:53.745
Here. Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!

04:08.434 --> 04:10.034
Shut up!

04:18.069 --> 04:21.403
<i>Brian</i>
<i>The babe they called Brian</i>

04:24.742 --> 04:27.542
<i>He grew</i>

04:28.037 --> 04:31.204
<i>Grew, grew and grew</i>

04:31.374 --> 04:35.269
<i>Grew up to be</i>

04:35.369 --> 04:38.955
<i>Grew up to be</i>

04:39.055 --> 04:41.425
<i>A boy called Brian</i>

04:41.594 --> 04:46.458
<i>A boy called Brian</i>

04:46.558 --> 04:49.549
<i>He had arms and legs</i>

04:49.727 --> 04:52.977
<i>And hands and feet</i>

04:53.147 --> 04:56.114
<i>This boy</i>

04:56.214 --> 04:59.482
<i>Whose name was Brian</i>

04:59.862 --> 05:03.390
<i>And he grew</i>

05:03.490 --> 05:06.449
<i>Grew, grew and grew</i>

05:06.619 --> 05:10.368
<i>Grew up to be</i>

05:10.468 --> 05:12.824
<i>Yes, he grew up to be</i>

05:13.000 --> 05:16.535
<i>A teenager called Brian</i>

05:16.712 --> 05:20.211
<i>A teenager called Brian</i>

05:20.382 --> 05:23.586
<i>And his face became spotty</i>

05:23.761 --> 05:27.131
<i>Yes, his face became spotty</i>

05:27.307 --> 05:30.972
<i>And his voice dropped down low</i>

05:31.144 --> 05:34.347
<i>And things started to grow</i>

05:34.523 --> 05:37.689
<i>On young Brian and show</i>

05:37.859 --> 05:41.228
<i>He was certainly no</i>

05:41.404 --> 05:45.023
<i>No girl named Brian</i>

05:45.200 --> 05:51.000
<i>Not a girl named Brian</i>

05:55.752 --> 05:59.002
<i>And he started to shave</i>

05:59.172 --> 06:02.173
<i>And have one off the wrist</i>

06:02.342 --> 06:05.960
<i>And want to see girls</i>

06:06.137 --> 06:09.471
<i>And go out and get pissed</i>

06:09.641 --> 06:12.928
<i>A man called Brian</i>

06:13.104 --> 06:16.437
<i>This man called Brian</i>

06:16.607 --> 06:23.007
<i>The man they called Brian</i>

06:24.532 --> 06:28.835
<i>This man called</i>

06:28.935 --> 06:31.238
<i>Brian</i>

07:19.463 --> 07:22.796
How blessed are those
who know that he's of God.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.338
How blessed are
the sorrowful.

07:26.511 --> 07:29.465
They shall find consolation.

07:30.891 --> 07:34.509
How blessed are those of gentle spirit.

07:35.270 --> 07:38.437
They shall have the earth
for their possession.

07:39.233 --> 07:45.983
How blessed are those who hunger
and thirst to see right prevail.

07:46.449 --> 07:49.154
They shall be satisfied.

07:50.620 --> 07:54.368
How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.829
They shall see God.

07:57.001 --> 07:59.706
- Speak up!
- Quiet, mum!

07:59.879 --> 08:02.964
Well, I can't hear a thing.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.508
Let's go to a stoning.

08:05.885 --> 08:09.135
- You can go to a stoning anytime.
- Come on, Brian.

08:09.347 --> 08:11.838
Will you be quiet?

08:12.141 --> 08:14.051
Don't pick your nose!

08:14.227 --> 08:15.686
I wasn't. I was scratching.

08:15.854 --> 08:18.309
You was picking it while you
was talking to that lady.

08:18.481 --> 08:21.435
- I wasn't!
- Leave it alone. Give it a rest.

08:21.651 --> 08:26.278
- Do you mind? I can't hear a word.
- Don't you "do you mind" me.

08:26.448 --> 08:29.200
- I was talking to my husband.
- Talk to him somewhere else.

08:29.368 --> 08:32.866
- I can't hear a bloody thing.
- Don't you swear at my wife.

08:33.038 --> 08:36.323
I was only asking her to shut up
so we can hear, big nose.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.789
Don't you call my husband "big nose."

08:38.961 --> 08:41.996
- Well, he has got a big nose.
- Could you be quiet, please?

08:42.172 --> 08:44.877
- What was that?
- I was too busy talking to big nose.

08:45.050 --> 08:47.802
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."

08:48.470 --> 08:51.044
What's so special about
the cheese makers?

08:51.223 --> 08:53.180
It's not meant to be taken literally.

08:53.350 --> 08:56.351
It refers to any manufacturers
of dairy products.

08:56.562 --> 08:59.183
If you hadn't been going on,
we'd have heard that, big nose.

08:59.356 --> 09:02.026
Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in!

09:02.193 --> 09:05.193
Listen, might be a bit
about "Blessed are the big noses."

09:05.362 --> 09:06.738
Lay off him.

09:07.114 --> 09:11.029
You're not so bad yourself, conk-face.
Where are you two from? Nose City?

09:11.661 --> 09:14.366
One more time,
I'll take you to the fucking cleaners!

09:14.539 --> 09:16.339
Language!

09:16.791 --> 09:18.998
And don't pick your nose!

09:19.169 --> 09:21.245
I wasn't going to.
I was gonna thump him!

09:21.463 --> 09:23.171
Hear that? Blessed are the Greek.

09:23.381 --> 09:26.833
- The Greek?
- Apparently, he's gonna inherit the earth.

09:27.052 --> 09:29.756
- Did anyone catch his name?
- You won't thump anybody.

09:29.930 --> 09:33.762
- I'll thump him if he calls me "big nose"!
- Shut up, big nose!

09:33.934 --> 09:35.807
Right. I warned you.

09:35.977 --> 09:37.934
I really will slug you so hard...!

09:38.104 --> 09:41.355
It's the meek.
"Blessed are the meek."

09:41.525 --> 09:45.569
That's nice, isn't it? I'm glad they getting
something. They have a hell of a time.

09:45.779 --> 09:49.230
Listen, I'm only telling the truth,
you have got a very big nose.

09:49.407 --> 09:54.154
Your nose is going to be three foot wide
across your face by the time I'm finished!

09:55.373 --> 09:57.200
Who hit yours? Goliath's big brother?

09:57.750 --> 10:01.664
- Right, that's your last warning.
- Do pipe down.

10:03.381 --> 10:06.584
Silly bitch, getting in the way.

10:08.177 --> 10:09.256
Break it up!

10:09.470 --> 10:12.471
- Come on, let's go to the stoning.
- All right.

10:16.269 --> 10:21.014
Blessed is just about everyone with an
interest in the status quo, right, Reg?

10:21.190 --> 10:25.603
What Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.

10:25.778 --> 10:30.239
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.

10:30.616 --> 10:34.116
Come on, Brian, or they'll have
stoned him before we get there.

10:34.287 --> 10:35.864
All right.

10:36.038 --> 10:40.203
Hey, get off her. That's disgusting.
Officer, intervene here.

10:40.377 --> 10:45.205
Attempted rape going on. It's the chap
with the big nose's fault. He started it all.

10:45.507 --> 10:47.963
I hate wearing these beards.

10:48.135 --> 10:52.085
- Why aren't women allowed at stonings?
- It's written, that's why.

10:53.724 --> 10:57.258
- Beard, madam?
- I haven't got time to go to no stonings.

10:57.436 --> 11:00.141
He's not well again.

11:00.522 --> 11:04.022
- Stone, sir?
- They've got them lying on the ground.

11:04.193 --> 11:09.269
Not like these, sir. Look at this. Feel
the quality of that. That's craftsmanship.

11:10.365 --> 11:13.402
All right. We'll have two with points
and a big, flat one.

11:13.577 --> 11:15.404
Could I have a flat one, Mum?

11:15.579 --> 11:16.777
Sorry. Dad.

11:16.955 --> 11:20.371
All right. Two points, two flats
and a packet of gravel.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.740
Packet of gravel.

11:21.919 --> 11:23.627
Should be a good one this afternoon.

11:23.795 --> 11:25.207
- Local boy.
- Oh, good.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.621
Enjoy yourselves.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.314
Matthias, son of
Deuteronomy of Gath...

11:48.488 --> 11:50.646
- Do I say yes?
- Yes!

11:50.865 --> 11:54.483
...you have been found guilty
by the elders of the town...

11:54.661 --> 11:57.531
...of uttering the name of our Lord...

11:57.705 --> 12:00.457
...and so as a blasphemer...

12:01.960 --> 12:05.459
...you are to be stoned to death!

12:05.880 --> 12:09.499
Look, I'd had a lovely supper,
and all I said to my wife was:

12:09.677 --> 12:13.674
"That piece of halibut was
good enough for Jehovah."

12:13.847 --> 12:17.216
Blasphemy! He said it again!

12:17.685 --> 12:20.389
- Did you hear him?
- Yeah! Yes, we did!

12:20.563 --> 12:21.808
Really.

12:25.985 --> 12:27.942
Are there any women here today?

12:33.951 --> 12:37.284
Very well. By virtue of the authority...

12:37.496 --> 12:38.611
...vested in me...

12:38.789 --> 12:41.743
Lay off! We haven't started yet.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.587
Come on! Who threw that?

12:45.504 --> 12:47.497
Who threw that stone? Come on!

12:47.673 --> 12:49.666
She did! She did!

12:49.842 --> 12:52.333
He did! He did! He did!

12:52.511 --> 12:54.635
Sorry, I thought we'd started.

12:54.848 --> 12:57.303
- Go to the back.
- Oh, dear.

12:57.475 --> 13:00.393
Always one, isn't there?

13:00.562 --> 13:03.978
- Now, where were we?
- I don't think it ought to be blasphemy...

13:04.149 --> 13:07.399
...just saying "Jehovah."
- He did! He did!

13:07.611 --> 13:09.769
You're only making it worse for yourself!

13:09.946 --> 13:12.520
Making it worse?!
How could it be worse?

13:12.699 --> 13:15.237
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!

13:15.410 --> 13:19.028
I'm warning you!
If you say Jehovah once more...

13:19.206 --> 13:21.661
Right! Who threw that?

13:23.293 --> 13:25.369
Come on! Who threw that?

13:27.380 --> 13:29.871
Him! Him! Him!

13:30.050 --> 13:31.544
- Was it you?
- Yes.

13:31.885 --> 13:34.376
- Right...
- Well, you did say Jehovah.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.843
Stop. Stop. Will you stop that?

13:41.020 --> 13:42.063
Stop it!

13:42.230 --> 13:47.935
Now, look. No one is to stone
anyone until I blow this whistle.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.486
Do you understand?

13:49.654 --> 13:52.987
Even, and I want to
make this absolutely clear...

13:53.157 --> 13:56.277
...even if they do say Jehovah.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.792
Good shot!

14:15.012 --> 14:18.512
- Have I got a big nose, mum?
- Stop thinking about sex.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.592
- I wasn't.
- You're always on about it.

14:20.768 --> 14:22.143
Morning, noon and night.

14:22.311 --> 14:24.886
"Will the girls like this,
will the girls like that?

14:25.065 --> 14:28.101
Is it too big, is it too small?"

14:31.154 --> 14:33.942
- Alms for a leper.
- Alms for a leper.

14:34.116 --> 14:36.689
Alms for an ex-leper.

14:36.869 --> 14:40.783
Bloody donkey-owners, all the same,
ain't they? Never have any change.

14:40.956 --> 14:42.450
Here's a touch.

14:42.624 --> 14:45.791
- Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
- Buzz off.

14:45.961 --> 14:47.752
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?

14:47.921 --> 14:50.246
A talent? That's more than
he earns in a month.

14:50.424 --> 14:52.297
- Half a talent then?
- No, go away.

14:52.467 --> 14:53.878
- Big nose, let's haggle.
- What?

14:54.052 --> 14:58.880
All right, let's say you open at one
shekel, I start at 2000, we close at 1800.

14:59.057 --> 15:00.100
- No.
- 1750?

15:00.267 --> 15:01.809
- Go away!
- 1740?

15:01.977 --> 15:04.646
- Leave him alone.
- All right. Two shekels, just two.

15:04.813 --> 15:07.849
- Is this fun, eh?
- Look, he's not giving you any money.

15:08.025 --> 15:10.433
Now piss off!

15:13.656 --> 15:16.194
All right, final offer,
half a shekel for an ex-leper?

15:16.367 --> 15:18.823
- Did you say ex-leper?
- That's right, sir.

15:18.995 --> 15:20.869
Sixteen years behind
a bell and proud of it.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.369
- Well, what happened?
- I was cured, sir.

15:23.541 --> 15:26.211
- Cured?
- A bloody miracle, sir. God bless you.

15:26.377 --> 15:28.833
- Who cured you?
- Jesus did, sir.

15:29.005 --> 15:31.081
I was hopping along,
minding my own business.

15:31.257 --> 15:33.582
All of a sudden, up he comes, cures me.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.054
One minute I'm a leper with a trade,
next minute my livelihood's gone.

15:38.223 --> 15:40.760
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody do-gooder.

15:40.975 --> 15:44.427
Well, why don't you go and tell him
that you want to be a leper again?

15:44.604 --> 15:46.727
I could do that sir.
I could, I suppose.

15:46.898 --> 15:50.682
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me
a bit lame in one leg during the week.

15:50.860 --> 15:54.693
You know, something beggable, but
not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.

15:54.865 --> 15:57.487
Brian. Come and clean your room out.

15:58.953 --> 16:00.577
- There you are.
- Thank you. Thank...

16:00.746 --> 16:05.788
- Half a dinare for me bloody life story?
- There's no pleasing some people.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.118
That's just what Jesus said, sir.

16:21.141 --> 16:22.766
Good afternoon.

16:23.644 --> 16:25.683
Hello, officer.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.058
I'll be with you in a few
moments, all right, dear?

16:29.233 --> 16:30.478
What's he doing here?

16:30.651 --> 16:34.269
- Don't start, Brian. Go clean your room.
- Bloody Romans.

16:34.446 --> 16:37.732
Now, look, Brian. If it wasn't for them,
we wouldn't have all this.

16:37.909 --> 16:41.492
- And don't you forget it.
- We don't owe the Romans anything.

16:41.663 --> 16:44.154
That's not entirely true, is it, Brian?

16:44.332 --> 16:45.375
What do you mean?

16:45.542 --> 16:48.543
Well, you know when you
were asking me about your?

16:48.712 --> 16:52.579
- My nose?
- Yes, well, there's a reason it's like it is.

16:52.757 --> 16:54.335
What is it?

16:54.509 --> 16:58.589
Well, I suppose I should have
told you a long time ago, but...

16:58.930 --> 17:00.887
Well, Brian...

17:01.850 --> 17:05.183
...your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
- I never thought he was.

17:05.353 --> 17:07.060
Now, none of your cheek!

17:07.230 --> 17:09.804
He was a Roman, Brian.

17:09.983 --> 17:12.604
He was a centurion in the Roman army.

17:12.777 --> 17:16.941
- You mean you were raped?!
- Well, at first, yes.

17:17.115 --> 17:21.029
- Who was it?
- Naughtius Maximus his name was.

17:21.286 --> 17:23.529
Promised me the known world,
he did.

17:23.705 --> 17:26.624
I was to be taken to Rome,
house by the Forum...

17:26.791 --> 17:28.785
...slaves, asses' milk...

17:28.961 --> 17:31.287
...as much gold as I could eat.

17:31.505 --> 17:35.752
Then he, having his way with me he had:
Like a rat out of an aqueduct.

17:35.927 --> 17:37.172
The bastard.

17:37.345 --> 17:40.464
Yes, and next time you go on
about the "bloody Romans"...

17:40.640 --> 17:43.973
...don't forget you're one of them.
- I'm not a Roman, Mum.

17:44.310 --> 17:48.473
And I never will be.
I'm a kike, a yid, a hebe, a hooknose.

17:48.648 --> 17:53.523
I'm kosher, Mum. I'm a Red Sea
pedestrian and proud of it!

17:57.573 --> 18:00.740
Sex, sex, sex, that's all
they think about, huh?

18:00.910 --> 18:03.615
Well, how are you then, officer?

18:21.265 --> 18:27.219
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest is between...

18:27.396 --> 18:32.307
...Frank Goliath,
the Macedonian baby-crusher...

18:32.484 --> 18:36.185
...and Boris Mineburg.

18:36.363 --> 18:37.905
Thank you, madam.

18:38.115 --> 18:41.116
Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers.

18:41.285 --> 18:45.532
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.

18:45.706 --> 18:48.410
Wolf-nipple chips.
Get them while they're hot. They're lovely.

18:48.584 --> 18:52.166
Dromedary pretzels, only half a dinar.
Tuscany fried bats...

18:52.337 --> 18:56.170
I do feel, Reg, that any
anti-imperialist group like ours...

18:56.342 --> 19:00.174
...must reflect such a divergence
of interest within its power base.

19:00.346 --> 19:04.047
- Agreed. Francis?
- Judith's point of view is very valid...

19:04.225 --> 19:08.140
...provided the movement never forgets
it is the unalienable right of every man...

19:08.313 --> 19:09.641
- Or woman.
...or woman...

19:09.814 --> 19:11.522
...to rid himself...
- Or herself.

19:11.691 --> 19:12.770
- Agreed.
- Thanks, brother.

19:12.942 --> 19:15.267
- Or sister.
- Or sister...

19:16.070 --> 19:17.814
Where was I?

19:18.448 --> 19:20.939
- I think you finished.
- Right.

19:21.117 --> 19:24.568
- It is the birthright of every man...
- Or woman.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.153
Shut up about women, Stan.
You're putting us off.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.119
Women have a perfect right to play
a part in our movement.

19:30.376 --> 19:32.369
Why are you always
on about women, Stan?

19:33.213 --> 19:35.122
I want to be one.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.216
What?

19:37.801 --> 19:39.924
I want to be a woman.

19:40.095 --> 19:44.556
From now on, I want you
all to call me Loretta.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.761
- What?
- It's my right as a man.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.769
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

19:52.149 --> 19:54.391
I want to have babies.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.276
You want to have babies?!

19:56.445 --> 19:59.114
It's every man's right to have
babies if he wants them.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.401
- But you can't have babies.
- Don't you oppress me.

20:02.576 --> 20:06.076
I'm not oppressing you, Stan.
You haven't got a womb.

20:06.247 --> 20:10.659
Where's the fetus gonna gestate?
You gonna keep it in a box?

20:13.671 --> 20:18.249
Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree
that he can't actually have babies...

20:18.425 --> 20:21.841
...not having a womb, which is nobody's
fault, not even the Romans'...

20:22.012 --> 20:26.177
...but he has the right to have babies.
- Good idea, Judith.

20:26.351 --> 20:30.515
We shall fight the oppressors for your
right to have babies, brother. Sister.

20:30.689 --> 20:33.061
- What's the point?
- What?

20:33.233 --> 20:38.689
Why fight for his right to have babies
when he can't have babies?

20:39.447 --> 20:43.908
It is symbolic of our struggle
against oppression.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.497
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.375
- Get out there. Get out.
- It's dangerous out there.

21:19.989 --> 21:24.034
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelots' spleens.

21:24.202 --> 21:25.945
- Got any nuts?
- Haven't got any nuts.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.738
- I've got wrens' livers, badgers' spleens...
- No, no, no.

21:29.916 --> 21:32.407
- Otters' noses?
- I don't want any Roman rubbish.

21:32.585 --> 21:35.669
- Why don't you sell proper food?
- Proper food?

21:35.838 --> 21:41.508
- Yeah, not those rich imperialist tidbits.
- Don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this.

21:41.677 --> 21:44.299
- All right, bag of otters' noses, then.
- Make it two.

21:44.472 --> 21:46.678
- Two.
- Thanks, Reg.

21:46.849 --> 21:49.471
- Are you the Judean People's Front?
- Fuck off.

21:49.685 --> 21:53.518
- What?
- Judean People's Front.

21:53.690 --> 21:55.932
We're The People's Front of Judea.

21:56.151 --> 21:59.816
- Judean People's Front, God!
- Wankers.

22:02.115 --> 22:05.200
- Can I join your group?
- No, piss off.

22:05.410 --> 22:10.452
I didn't want to sell this. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.491
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.

22:14.670 --> 22:16.330
I hate the Romans already.

22:16.547 --> 22:22.632
Listen, if you wanted to join the PFJ,
you'd have to really hate the Romans.

22:22.803 --> 22:23.803
I do.

22:24.638 --> 22:27.888
- Oh, yeah, how much?
- A lot.

22:30.352 --> 22:32.345
Right, you're in. Listen...

22:32.938 --> 22:37.352
...the only people we hate more than
Romans are the Judean People's Front.

22:37.527 --> 22:40.611
- Splitters.
- And the Judean Popular People's Front.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.108
- Oh, yeah.
- Splitters.

22:42.282 --> 22:44.951
- And the People's Front of Judea.
- Yeah. Splitters.

22:45.118 --> 22:47.573
- What?
- The People's Front of Judea. Splitters.

22:47.745 --> 22:50.581
We're the People's Front of Judea.

22:50.748 --> 22:55.541
- I thought we were the Popular Front.
- People's Front.

22:55.712 --> 22:58.748
Whatever happened
to the Popular Front, Reg?

22:58.923 --> 23:00.086
He's over there.

23:02.969 --> 23:04.769
Splitter!

23:12.604 --> 23:16.436
I think I'm about to have
a cardiac arrest.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.476
Absolutely dreadful.

23:34.877 --> 23:38.293
- What's your name?
- Brian. Brian Cohen.

23:39.089 --> 23:42.589
We may have a little job for you, Brian.

24:37.190 --> 24:41.058
What's this then?
<i>"Romanes eunt domus"?</i>

24:41.278 --> 24:44.362
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

24:44.531 --> 24:47.152
It says, "Romans go home."

24:47.325 --> 24:50.659
No, it doesn't. What's Latin for Roman?

24:50.829 --> 24:52.490
- Come on.
<i>- Romanus?</i>

24:52.665 --> 24:53.993
- Goes like?
<i>- Anus?</i>

24:54.166 --> 24:56.788
Vocative plural of <i>anus</i> is?

24:56.961 --> 24:59.997
<i>- Ani?</i>
<i>- Romani.</i>

25:00.256 --> 25:02.628
- <i>"Eunt"?</i> What is <i>eunt?</i>
- Go.

25:02.800 --> 25:08.139
- Conjugate the verb "to go."
<i>- Ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.</i>

25:08.306 --> 25:10.179
So <i>eunt</i> is?

25:10.349 --> 25:13.019
Third person plural, present indicative.
"They go."

25:13.185 --> 25:18.262
But "Romans go home" is an order,
so you must use the?

25:18.441 --> 25:20.813
- Imperative!
- Which is?

25:21.777 --> 25:23.984
- Oh, <i>- i.</i>
- How many Romans?

25:24.155 --> 25:27.939
- Plural, plural. <i>Ite. Ite.</i>
<i>- Ite.</i>

25:28.743 --> 25:31.412
<i>Domus?</i> Nominative?

25:31.579 --> 25:35.446
"Go home." This is motion
towards, isn't it, boy?

25:35.625 --> 25:39.326
Dative! Not dative,
not the dative, sir!

25:40.214 --> 25:43.084
The accusative! Accusative!
<i>Domum,</i> sir. <i>Ad domum.</i>

25:43.258 --> 25:46.129
- Except that <i>domus</i> takes the?
- The locative, sir.

25:46.303 --> 25:47.466
- Which is?
<i>- Domum!</i>

25:47.638 --> 25:50.238
<i>Domum.</i>

25:52.434 --> 25:53.597
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

25:53.769 --> 25:56.972
- Write that 100 times.
- Yes, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar.

25:57.147 --> 25:59.899
If it's not done by sunrise,
I'll cut your balls off.

26:00.108 --> 26:03.394
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.685
Finished.

26:28.388 --> 26:33.465
Right. Now, don't do it again.

26:56.249 --> 26:57.529
Hey. Bloody Romans.

27:32.745 --> 27:35.200
We get in through the underground
heating-system...

27:35.372 --> 27:38.042
...up through into the main
audience chamber here...

27:38.209 --> 27:40.746
...and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

27:41.295 --> 27:43.703
Having grabbed his wife,
we inform Pilate...

27:43.881 --> 27:47.581
...that she is in our custody,
and forthwith issue our demands.

27:47.801 --> 27:50.257
- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?

27:50.471 --> 27:55.015
We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle
the entire Roman imperialist state...

27:55.185 --> 27:57.806
...and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

27:57.979 --> 28:00.186
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.

28:00.398 --> 28:03.814
Send them back on the hour, every hour.
Show them we're not to be trifled with.

28:04.027 --> 28:08.819
And of course, we point out that they bear
full responsibility when we chop her up...

28:08.990 --> 28:12.406
...and that we shall not
submit to blackmail.

28:12.619 --> 28:14.446
No blackmail!

28:14.621 --> 28:18.488
They've bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.

28:18.708 --> 28:22.124
And not just from us! From our fathers,
and from our fathers' fathers.

28:22.295 --> 28:24.502
- And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Yeah.

28:24.673 --> 28:28.622
- And our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
- All right, don't labour the point.

28:28.802 --> 28:32.005
And what have they ever
given us in return?

28:33.974 --> 28:35.598
The aqueduct?

28:36.227 --> 28:38.266
- What?
- The aqueduct.

28:38.437 --> 28:41.107
Yeah, they did give us that.
That's true, yeah.

28:41.274 --> 28:43.266
And the sanitation.

28:43.442 --> 28:46.776
Yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

28:46.946 --> 28:51.026
I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation,
the two things the Romans have done.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.691
- And the roads.
- Yeah, obviously the roads.

28:53.869 --> 28:56.195
I mean the roads go
without saying, don't they?

28:56.372 --> 28:58.661
But apart from sanitation,
aqueduct and roads...

28:58.833 --> 29:01.240
- Irrigation.
- Medicine.

29:01.419 --> 29:04.088
- Education.
- Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.

29:04.297 --> 29:06.289
And the wine.

29:07.425 --> 29:10.342
That's something we'd really miss, Reg,
if the Romans left.

29:10.511 --> 29:11.674
Public baths.

29:11.846 --> 29:14.135
It's safe to walk in the streets
at night now.

29:14.307 --> 29:15.635
They know how to keep order.

29:15.808 --> 29:19.307
Let's face it, they're the only ones
who could in a place like this.

29:20.521 --> 29:25.231
All right, but apart from sanitation,
medicine, education, wine, public order...

29:25.402 --> 29:29.020
...irrigation, roads, the fresh-water
system and public health...

29:29.197 --> 29:32.649
...what have the Romans
ever done for us?

29:32.826 --> 29:37.951
- Brought peace?
- Peace. Shut up!

29:47.716 --> 29:52.425
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
My legs are old and bented.

29:52.596 --> 29:57.009
- It's all right, Matthias.
- It's all clear.

30:04.316 --> 30:06.475
Well, where's Reg?

30:07.278 --> 30:10.861
Reg. Reg. It's Judith.

30:11.032 --> 30:14.650
- What went wrong?
- The first blow has been struck.

30:14.994 --> 30:17.746
- Did he finish the slogan?
- 100 times.

30:17.914 --> 30:21.994
In letters 10 foot high,
all the way around the palace.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.077
Oh, great.

30:24.254 --> 30:29.959
Great. We need doers in our movement,
Brian, but before you join us, know this:

30:30.134 --> 30:32.542
There is not one of us who would not
gladly die...

30:32.720 --> 30:35.093
...to rid this country of the Romans.

30:35.265 --> 30:37.257
Well, one.

30:37.433 --> 30:41.217
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But
otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?

30:41.563 --> 30:42.563
Yes.

30:44.274 --> 30:48.982
From now on, you shall be called,
"Brian, that is called Brian."

30:49.153 --> 30:51.443
Tell him about the raid
on Pilate's palace, Francis.

30:51.615 --> 30:53.857
Right. This is the plan:

30:54.910 --> 30:57.532
<i>Now, this is the palace</i>
<i>in Caesar's Square.</i>

30:57.746 --> 31:00.451
<i>Our commando unit will approach</i>
<i>from Fish Street...</i>

31:00.833 --> 31:03.917
<i>... and make our way</i>
<i>to the northwestern main drain.</i>

31:04.086 --> 31:08.499
<i>If questioned, we are sewage workers</i>
<i>on our way to a conference.</i>

31:08.674 --> 31:11.841
<i>Reg, our glorious leader</i>
<i>and founder of the PFJ...</i>

31:12.011 --> 31:15.462
<i>... will be coordinating consultant</i>
<i>at the drain head...</i>

31:15.639 --> 31:20.135
<i>... though he will not be taking part in any</i>
<i>terrorist action, as he has a bad back.</i>

31:20.311 --> 31:22.884
- Aren't you gonna come with us?
- Solidarity, brother.

31:23.063 --> 31:25.768
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.

31:25.941 --> 31:28.978
<i>Once in the sewer,</i>
<i>timing will be of the essence.</i>

31:29.194 --> 31:31.982
<i>There is a Roman feast later,</i>
<i>so we must move fast...</i>

31:32.156 --> 31:34.611
<i>... and don't wear your best sandals.</i>

31:34.783 --> 31:38.948
<i>Turning left here, we enter</i>
<i>the Caesar Augustus Memorial Sewer.</i>

31:39.122 --> 31:41.660
<i>And from there proceed directly</i>
<i>to the hypocaust.</i>

31:41.833 --> 31:46.875
<i>This has just been re-tiled.</i>
<i>So terrorists, careful with those weapons.</i>

31:47.047 --> 31:50.546
<i>We will now be directly beneath</i>
<i>Pilate's audience chamber itself.</i>

31:50.759 --> 31:54.756
<i>This is the moment</i>
<i>for Habakkuk to get out his prong.</i>

33:13.260 --> 33:14.754
Campaign for Free Galilee.

33:16.763 --> 33:18.922
People's Front of Judea. Officials.

33:20.726 --> 33:24.593
- What's your group doing here?
- We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife.

33:24.771 --> 33:26.052
- So are we.
- What?

33:26.231 --> 33:27.891
That's our plan.

33:28.108 --> 33:29.982
- We were here first.
- What do you mean?

33:30.152 --> 33:32.026
- We thought of it first.
- Oh, yeah?

33:32.195 --> 33:34.318
Yes, a couple of years ago.

33:34.489 --> 33:37.407
- We did.
- You got all your demands worked out?

33:37.576 --> 33:39.568
- Of course we have.
- What are they?

33:39.745 --> 33:42.200
- Well, I'm not telling you.
- Pull the other one.

33:42.372 --> 33:44.863
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

33:45.042 --> 33:46.084
- Did not.
- We did.

33:46.251 --> 33:48.493
- You didn't.
- We bloody did!

33:48.670 --> 33:50.830
Bastards, we've been
planning this for months.

33:51.007 --> 33:53.046
Well, tough titty for you, fish-face.

33:53.218 --> 33:55.044
- All right.
- Why you sly...

33:55.261 --> 33:57.931
Brothers! Brothers!
We should be struggling together!

33:58.139 --> 33:59.539
We are.

34:00.433 --> 34:01.713
We mustn't fight each other!

34:01.893 --> 34:05.060
Surely, we should be united
against the common enemy!

34:05.480 --> 34:07.354
The Judean People's Front?!

34:07.523 --> 34:10.145
No, no, the Romans!

34:10.318 --> 34:12.607
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.315
- Yeah, he's right.
- Look out!

34:14.530 --> 34:16.130
Careful.

34:21.286 --> 34:23.409
- Right! Where were we?
- You were gonna punch me.

34:23.581 --> 34:24.862
Oh, yeah!

34:47.982 --> 34:49.773
Brothers!

34:49.942 --> 34:51.542
Get off!

35:51.588 --> 35:55.206
- You lucky bastard.
- Who's that?

35:55.383 --> 35:58.717
- You lucky, lucky bastard.
- What?

35:58.887 --> 36:02.090
- Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we?
- What do you mean?

36:02.265 --> 36:04.804
You must have slipped him
a few shekels, eh?

36:05.019 --> 36:07.936
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face!

36:08.147 --> 36:12.097
What wouldn't I give
to be spat at in the face?

36:12.276 --> 36:16.938
I sometimes hang awake at night,
dreaming of being spat at in the face.

36:17.156 --> 36:19.908
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They had me in manacles!

36:20.117 --> 36:21.917
Manacles!

36:22.745 --> 36:24.025
My idea of heaven...

36:24.205 --> 36:28.333
...is to be allowed to be put in manacles
just for a few hours.

36:28.542 --> 36:32.587
They must think the sun shines
out of your arse, sonny.

36:32.797 --> 36:34.670
Lay off me, I've had a hard time!

36:34.882 --> 36:37.753
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years...

36:37.927 --> 36:41.378
...they only hung me the right way up
yesterday! So don't you come around...

36:41.597 --> 36:42.842
All right, all right.

36:43.391 --> 36:47.685
They must think
you're Lord God almighty.

36:47.853 --> 36:51.603
- What will they do to me?
- You'll probably get away with crucifixion.

36:51.942 --> 36:54.729
- Crucifixion?!
- Yeah. First offence.

36:54.945 --> 36:58.859
- Get away with crucifixion?! It's...
- Best thing the Romans ever did for us.

36:59.032 --> 37:00.230
- What?!
- Oh, yeah.

37:00.409 --> 37:03.279
If we didn't have crucifixion,
this country would be a mess.

37:03.662 --> 37:06.283
- Guard!
- Nail them up, I say!

37:06.498 --> 37:09.452
- Guard!
- Nail some sense into them!

37:10.252 --> 37:14.830
- What do you want?
- I want you to move me to another cell.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.335
Oh, look at that! Bloody favouritism!

37:18.719 --> 37:21.292
- Shut up, you.
- Sorry.

37:24.433 --> 37:27.054
Now, take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.

37:27.227 --> 37:29.386
Every night they take me down
for 20 minutes...

37:29.563 --> 37:30.843
...then they hang me up again.

37:31.023 --> 37:33.774
Which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

37:34.193 --> 37:38.772
And if nothing else, it's taught me
to respect the Romans...

37:38.948 --> 37:42.483
...and it's taught me that
you'll never get anywhere in this life...

37:42.660 --> 37:47.121
...unless you are prepared to do
a fair day's work for a fair day's...

37:47.332 --> 37:48.932
Shut up!

37:51.377 --> 37:53.536
- Pilate wants to see you!
- Me?

37:53.755 --> 37:56.709
- Come on!
- Pilate? What does he want to see me for?

37:56.883 --> 38:00.583
I think he wants to know which
way you ought to be crucified.

38:02.138 --> 38:04.890
- Nice one, centurion. Like it, like it.
- Shut up!

38:05.391 --> 38:07.135
Right. Right.

38:08.269 --> 38:12.018
Terrific race, the Romans. Terrific.

38:29.667 --> 38:30.995
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail.

38:31.168 --> 38:33.457
Only one survivor, sir.

38:33.629 --> 38:35.420
Throw him to the floor.

38:35.589 --> 38:39.504
- What, sir?
- Throw him to the floor.

38:43.514 --> 38:46.717
Now, what is your name, Jew?

38:47.351 --> 38:49.723
- Brian, sir.
- Brian, eh?

38:49.937 --> 38:51.728
No, no, Brian.

38:54.441 --> 38:56.979
The little rascal has spirit.

38:57.152 --> 38:59.110
- Has what, sir?
- Spirit.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.272
Yes, he did, sir.

39:01.448 --> 39:06.657
No, no, spirit.
Bravado, a touch of derring-do.

39:07.289 --> 39:10.089
About 11, sir.

39:11.167 --> 39:12.167
So...

39:13.545 --> 39:16.118
- You dare to raid us?
- To what, sir?

39:16.298 --> 39:20.082
Strike him, centurion, very roughly.

39:20.260 --> 39:22.929
And throw him to the floor, sir?

39:23.096 --> 39:25.089
- What?
- Throw him to the floor again, sir?

39:25.265 --> 39:28.515
Oh, yes. Throw him to the floor, please.

39:30.061 --> 39:33.347
Now, Jewish rapscallion...

39:33.732 --> 39:35.559
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Roman.

39:35.984 --> 39:38.522
- A Roman?
- No, no, Roman.

39:40.447 --> 39:44.029
So your father was a Roman?

39:44.200 --> 39:45.659
Who was he?

39:45.827 --> 39:49.696
He was a centurion
in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.

39:49.874 --> 39:51.274
Really?

39:51.709 --> 39:56.205
- What was his name?
- Naughtius Maximus.

39:58.841 --> 40:02.886
Centurion, do you have anyone
of that name in the garrison?

40:03.220 --> 40:04.964
Well, no, sir.

40:05.139 --> 40:08.010
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?

40:08.184 --> 40:11.968
Well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.

40:12.146 --> 40:17.603
Like "Sillius Soddus"
or "Biggus Dickus," sir.

40:17.902 --> 40:22.315
What's so funny about Biggus Dickus?

40:22.698 --> 40:25.569
Well, it's a joke name, sir.

40:26.244 --> 40:30.193
I have a very great friend in Rome
called Biggus Dickus.

40:32.041 --> 40:34.913
Silence! What is all this insolence?

40:35.087 --> 40:38.456
You will find yourself
in gladiator school very quickly...

40:38.632 --> 40:40.459
...with rotten behaviour like that.

40:40.676 --> 40:43.380
Can I go now, sir?

40:44.680 --> 40:47.135
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.

40:47.307 --> 40:50.427
- Right! Take him away!
- Sir, he...

40:50.602 --> 40:53.603
No, no, I want him fighting
rabid wild animals within a week!

40:53.772 --> 40:57.188
Yes, sir. Come on, you.

41:00.070 --> 41:05.361
I will not have my friends ridiculed
by the common soldiery!

41:07.244 --> 41:10.529
Anybody else feel like a little...

41:10.706 --> 41:12.200
...giggle...

41:12.374 --> 41:15.541
...when I mention my friend...

41:16.003 --> 41:17.995
...Biggus...

41:19.257 --> 41:21.166
...Dickus?

41:24.429 --> 41:25.923
And what about you?

41:26.097 --> 41:29.548
Do you find it risible...

41:31.269 --> 41:34.638
...when I say the name...

41:34.814 --> 41:36.854
...Biggus...

41:38.151 --> 41:40.060
...Dickus?

41:58.671 --> 42:01.957
He has a wife, you know.

42:02.508 --> 42:05.546
You know what she's called?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.597
She's called...

42:09.767 --> 42:12.139
...Incontinentia.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.602
Incontinentia Buttocks. Shut up!

42:16.774 --> 42:18.351
What is all this?

42:18.525 --> 42:22.108
I've had enough of this rowdy-rebel,
sniggering behaviour!

42:22.279 --> 42:25.529
Silence!
You call yourselves centurion guards?

42:25.741 --> 42:29.406
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!

44:27.157 --> 44:30.692
You lucky bastard.

44:46.260 --> 44:48.797
And the beast's head
shall be huge and black...

44:48.971 --> 44:53.514
...and the eyes. They're of red,
with the blood of living creatures!

44:53.976 --> 44:59.681
And the whore of Babylon shall ride
forth on a three-headed serpent...

44:59.856 --> 45:05.018
...and throughout the land
shall be a great rubbing of parts.

45:05.196 --> 45:09.360
And the demon shall bear
a nine-bladed sword!

45:09.534 --> 45:13.911
Nine-bladed! Not two
or five or seven, but nine!

45:14.080 --> 45:18.789
Which he will wield on all wretched
sinners. Sinners just like you, sir, there.

45:18.960 --> 45:23.171
- And the horns shall be on the head...
- Through Hebediah, his servant...

45:23.339 --> 45:28.334
...there shall in that time be rumours
of things going astray...

45:28.511 --> 45:33.007
...and there shall be a great confusion
as to where things really are.

45:33.182 --> 45:37.263
And nobody will really know
where lieth those little things...

45:37.437 --> 45:41.933
...with the sort of raffia-work base,
that has an attachment.

45:42.358 --> 45:47.483
At this time, a friend shall
lose his friend's hammer...

45:47.656 --> 45:50.693
...and the young shall not
know where lieth...

45:50.868 --> 45:52.825
...the things possessed
by their fathers...

45:52.995 --> 45:56.743
...that their fathers put there only
just the night before, about 8:00.

45:56.957 --> 45:59.875
Yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...

46:00.044 --> 46:03.744
...that in that time shall the turds...

46:12.264 --> 46:14.173
- How much? Quickly.
- What?

46:14.350 --> 46:17.849
- It's for the wife.
- Twenty shekels.

46:18.020 --> 46:19.479
- Right.
- What?

46:19.647 --> 46:21.355
- There you are.
- Wait a minute.

46:21.523 --> 46:23.765
- What?
- Well, we're supposed to haggle.

46:23.943 --> 46:25.769
- No, I've got to...
- What do you mean, "No"?

46:25.945 --> 46:27.439
- I haven't got time...
- Give it back.

46:27.613 --> 46:29.356
- No, no, no, I just paid you.
- Burt.

46:29.531 --> 46:31.607
- Yeah?
- This bloke won't haggle.

46:31.784 --> 46:34.454
- Won't haggle?!
- All right, do we have to?

46:34.621 --> 46:37.408
- Now look, I want 20 for that.
- I just gave you 20.

46:37.582 --> 46:39.990
- Are you telling me that's not worth 20?
- No.

46:40.168 --> 46:42.576
Look. Feel the quality,
that's none of your goat.

46:42.754 --> 46:45.589
- All right, I'll give you 19.
- No, come on, do it properly.

46:45.757 --> 46:48.330
- What?
- Haggle properly, this isn't worth 19.

46:48.510 --> 46:51.261
- Well, you just said it was worth 20.
- Oh, dear, oh, dear.

46:51.429 --> 46:53.552
- Come on, haggle.
- All right, I'll give you 10.

46:53.723 --> 46:57.009
That's more like it.
Ten? Are you trying to insult me?

46:57.185 --> 47:00.103
Me, with a poor,
dying grandmother? Ten?

47:00.272 --> 47:03.023
- All right, I'll give you 11.
- Now you're getting it. 11?!

47:03.191 --> 47:04.899
Did I hear you right? 11?

47:05.068 --> 47:07.939
- This cost me 12, you want to ruin me?
- Seventeen?

47:08.113 --> 47:10.734
- No, no, no, no, "17"!
- Eighteen?

47:10.907 --> 47:13.861
- No, no, you go to 14 now.
- All right, I'll give you 14.

47:14.077 --> 47:17.161
- Fourteen!? Are you joking?
- That's what you told me to say!

47:17.331 --> 47:19.490
- Oh, dear.
- Tell me what to say, please!

47:20.710 --> 47:22.536
- Offer me 14.
- I'll give you 14.

47:22.837 --> 47:25.707
- He's offering me 14 for this!
- Fifteen!

47:25.923 --> 47:29.126
Seventeen. My last word, I won't take
a penny less, or strike me dead.

47:29.343 --> 47:31.003
- Sixteen.
- Done.

47:31.679 --> 47:33.090
Nice to do business with you.

47:33.264 --> 47:35.636
- I'll throw you in this as well.
- I don't want it.

47:35.808 --> 47:37.386
- Burt.
- Yeah.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.636
- All right.
- Now, where's the 16 you owe me?

47:39.812 --> 47:40.975
I just gave you 20.

47:41.147 --> 47:43.982
- That's right, that's four I owe you.
- No, that's all right.

47:44.150 --> 47:47.270
- No, I've got it here.
- It's all right, that's four for the gourd.

47:47.445 --> 47:49.936
Four? For this gourd? Four!?

47:50.114 --> 47:52.272
It's worth 10
if it's worth a shekel!

47:52.491 --> 47:55.611
- You just gave it to me for nothing.
- Yes, but it's worth 10.

47:55.995 --> 47:57.454
All right, all right.

48:00.207 --> 48:03.494
No, no, no, no, it's not worth 10,
you're supposed to argue.

48:03.670 --> 48:06.078
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"

48:08.926 --> 48:12.211
Oh, well. One born every minute.

48:12.679 --> 48:14.339
- Daniel.
- Daniel.

48:14.514 --> 48:15.594
- Job.
- Job.

48:15.766 --> 48:17.260
- Job.
- Joshua.

48:17.434 --> 48:18.679
- Joshua.
- Joshua.

48:18.852 --> 48:19.967
- Judges.
- Judges.

48:20.145 --> 48:21.770
- Judges.
- And Brian.

48:21.939 --> 48:24.394
- And Brian.
- And Brian.

48:24.566 --> 48:28.398
I now propose that all seven
of these ex-brothers...

48:28.570 --> 48:31.820
...be now entered in the minutes
as probationary martyrs to the cause.

48:31.990 --> 48:35.655
- I second that, Reg.
- Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.

48:35.827 --> 48:39.872
Siblings, let us not be down on it.

48:40.040 --> 48:44.832
One total catastrophe like this
is just the beginning!

48:45.003 --> 48:47.922
Their glorious deaths
shall unite us all in a...

48:48.132 --> 48:49.932
Look out!

49:01.187 --> 49:02.387
Hello?

49:03.022 --> 49:04.766
Matthias?

49:05.483 --> 49:08.567
- Reg.
- Go away.

49:09.028 --> 49:13.108
- Reg, it's me, Brian.
- Get off. Get off out of it.

49:13.283 --> 49:14.481
- Stan?
- Piss off.

49:14.659 --> 49:17.115
- Yeah, piss off.
- Bugger off.

49:20.331 --> 49:21.331
Shit!

49:22.500 --> 49:23.900
Coming.

49:29.132 --> 49:32.715
Yea, verily at that time,
which is written in the Book of Obadiah...

49:32.928 --> 49:37.222
...a man shall strike his donkey
and his nephew's donkey...

49:37.391 --> 49:40.641
...and anyone in the vicinity
of either the nephew or the donkey.

49:40.853 --> 49:44.138
My eyes are dim, I cannot see.

49:44.315 --> 49:46.141
- Are you Matthias?
- Yes.

49:46.317 --> 49:49.021
We believe you may
be hiding one Brian of Nazareth...

49:49.194 --> 49:52.528
...member of the terrorist organization
the People's Front of Judea.

49:52.698 --> 49:57.407
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man,
I have no time for lawbreakers.

49:57.578 --> 50:01.825
My legs are grey, my ears are nulled,
my eyes are old and bent...

50:01.999 --> 50:03.197
Quiet!

50:03.375 --> 50:07.539
Silly person. Guards, search the house.

50:16.973 --> 50:21.434
You know the penalty laid down by Roman
law for harbouring a known criminal?

50:21.603 --> 50:24.853
- No.
- Crucifixion.

50:26.274 --> 50:29.809
- Nasty, eh?
- It could be worse.

50:29.986 --> 50:34.280
- What do you mean, "could be worse"?
- Well, you could be stabbed.

50:34.449 --> 50:36.358
Stabbed? It takes a second.

50:36.534 --> 50:40.912
Crucifixion lasts hours.
It's a slow, horrible death.

50:41.081 --> 50:44.913
Well, at least it gets you
out in the open air.

50:45.085 --> 50:47.685
You're weird.

50:54.761 --> 50:57.881
No, sir, couldn't find anything, sir.

50:58.056 --> 51:02.221
Well, don't worry, you've not seen
the last of us, weirdo.

51:02.395 --> 51:04.886
- Big nose.
- Watch it!

51:08.067 --> 51:10.392
That was lucky.

51:13.239 --> 51:17.106
- I'm sorry, Reg.
- Oh, it's all right. Siblings, he's sorry.

51:17.285 --> 51:19.989
He's sorry he led the Fifth legion
to our headquarters.

51:20.162 --> 51:21.822
Well, that's all right then, Brian.

51:21.998 --> 51:25.117
Sit down! Have a scone.
Make yourself at home.

51:25.293 --> 51:26.835
You klutz!

51:27.003 --> 51:32.245
You stupid, birdbrained, flat-headed...

51:35.136 --> 51:37.543
- with a great juicy melon behind.

51:39.140 --> 51:42.591
My legs are old and bent,
my ears are grizzled, yes?

51:42.768 --> 51:45.888
There's one place we didn't look. Guards!

51:46.063 --> 51:52.268
I'm just a poor old man, my sight is dim,
my eyes are poor, my nose is knackered.

51:52.446 --> 51:57.523
- Have you ever seen anyone crucified?
- Crucifixion's a doddle.

51:57.701 --> 52:00.618
Don't keep saying that.

52:04.124 --> 52:06.366
Found this spoon, sir.

52:06.543 --> 52:09.248
Well done, sergeant.

52:09.421 --> 52:13.419
We'll be back, oddball.

52:16.219 --> 52:19.505
- Open up.
- You haven't given us time to hide.

52:44.165 --> 52:48.910
Don't pass judgment on other people,
or you might get judged yourself.

52:49.087 --> 52:50.087
What?

52:50.338 --> 52:52.710
I said, don't pass judgment
on other people...

52:52.882 --> 52:55.551
...or else you might get judged too.

52:55.718 --> 52:57.047
- Who, me?
- Yes.

52:57.220 --> 53:00.838
- Thank you very much.
- Well, not just you, all of you.

53:01.015 --> 53:03.222
- That's a nice gourd.
- What?

53:03.393 --> 53:05.599
- How much do you want for the gourd?
- You can have it.

53:05.770 --> 53:08.475
- Have it?
- Yes. Consider the lilies.

53:08.648 --> 53:10.854
- Don't you want to haggle?
- No. In the field.

53:11.025 --> 53:13.148
- What's wrong with it, then?
- Nothing, take it.

53:13.361 --> 53:16.316
- Consider the lilies?
- Well, the birds, then.

53:16.490 --> 53:18.032
- What birds?
- Any birds.

53:18.200 --> 53:21.284
- Why?
- Well, have they got jobs?

53:21.453 --> 53:23.031
- Who?
- The birds.

53:23.205 --> 53:24.997
Have the birds got jobs?!

53:25.207 --> 53:28.161
- What's the matter with him?
- He says the birds are scrounging.

53:28.335 --> 53:31.621
No, the point is the birds,
they do all right, don't they?

53:31.839 --> 53:34.508
- Well, and good luck to them!
- Yeah, they're very pretty.

53:34.717 --> 53:38.845
Okay. And you're much more
important than they are, right?

53:39.013 --> 53:41.385
So, what are you worrying about?
There you are! See?

53:41.765 --> 53:44.091
I'm worrying about what
you've got against birds.

53:44.685 --> 53:47.176
I haven't got anything against birds.
Consider lilies...

53:47.354 --> 53:50.391
- He's having a go at the flowers now.
- Give the flowers a chance.

53:50.566 --> 53:52.642
- I'll give you one for it.
- It's yours!

53:52.818 --> 53:54.099
Two then.

53:54.278 --> 53:56.899
Look, there was this man,
and he had two servants...

53:57.114 --> 53:58.193
- What were they called?
- What?

53:58.365 --> 54:00.524
- What were their names?
- I don't know.

54:00.701 --> 54:02.113
And he gave them some talents...

54:02.287 --> 54:04.694
- You don't know?
- Well, it doesn't matter.

54:04.873 --> 54:06.782
He doesn't know what they were called!

54:06.958 --> 54:09.081
Oh, they were called
Simon and Adrian. Now...

54:09.252 --> 54:10.628
You said you didn't know!

54:10.795 --> 54:13.465
It doesn't matter,
the point is there were two servants...

54:13.632 --> 54:16.502
- He's making it up as he goes along!
- No, I'm not!

54:16.676 --> 54:19.048
And he gave them...
Wait a minute, were there three?

54:19.220 --> 54:21.509
- He's terrible.
- There were three...

54:21.723 --> 54:25.009
- He's still a traitor!
- Oh, get off!

54:30.982 --> 54:33.853
Now hear this. Blessed are they...

54:34.027 --> 54:38.605
...who convert their neighbour's ox,
for they shall inhibit their girth.

54:38.782 --> 54:44.024
- Rubbish!
- And to them only shall be given...

54:44.204 --> 54:46.447
To them only...

54:47.291 --> 54:50.328
...shall be given...

54:52.255 --> 54:53.255
What?

54:54.006 --> 54:56.841
- Shall be given what?
- Oh, nothing.

54:57.051 --> 54:58.711
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

54:58.886 --> 55:01.093
- You were going to say something.
- I finished.

55:01.264 --> 55:03.505
- Oh, no, no.
- Come on, tell us before you go.

55:03.724 --> 55:05.764
- I wasn't going to say anything.
- No, you hadn't.

55:05.935 --> 55:07.809
- What won't he tell us?
- He won't say.

55:07.979 --> 55:09.389
- Is it a secret?
- No.

55:09.563 --> 55:11.556
- Is it?
- It must be, otherwise he'd tell us.

55:11.732 --> 55:13.274
- Tell us.
- Leave me alone.

55:13.442 --> 55:15.933
- What is the secret?
- Is it the secret of eternal life?

55:16.112 --> 55:17.154
He won't say!

55:17.321 --> 55:19.812
If I knew the secret
of eternal life, I wouldn't say.

55:19.991 --> 55:21.817
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me, please.

55:21.993 --> 55:24.484
- No, tell us, master, we were here first.
- Rubbish!

55:24.662 --> 55:26.370
- Five!
- Go away!

55:26.539 --> 55:28.413
- Tell us, master.
- I can't go above 5.

55:28.583 --> 55:31.538
- Is that his gourd?
- Yes, but it's under offer.

55:31.712 --> 55:34.962
- This is his gourd.
- Ten!

55:35.132 --> 55:40.292
It is his gourd.
We will carry it for you, master.

55:40.470 --> 55:41.870
Master?

55:42.264 --> 55:45.680
He's gone. He's been taken up.

55:45.851 --> 55:49.302
- Oh, he has been taken up!
- Eighteen!

55:49.479 --> 55:51.139
No, there he is. Over there.

56:17.258 --> 56:18.258
Look!

56:19.719 --> 56:23.669
- He has given us a sign.
- He has given us his shoe.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.600
The shoe is the sign!
Let us follow his example!

56:26.768 --> 56:29.389
- What?
- Let us, like him...

56:29.562 --> 56:32.136
...hold up one shoe and let the other
be upon our foot...

56:32.315 --> 56:35.731
...for this is his sign that all who
follow him shall do likewise!

56:35.902 --> 56:40.979
No, no, the shoe is a sign that we must
gather shoes together in abundance.

56:41.157 --> 56:45.985
- Cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
- No, let us gather shoes together.

56:46.162 --> 56:47.740
- Let me!
- Oh, get off!

56:47.914 --> 56:50.037
No, it is a sign that, like him,
we must think...

56:50.208 --> 56:53.043
...not of the things of the body,
but of the face and head!

56:53.211 --> 56:56.081
- Give me your shoe!
- Get off!

56:56.256 --> 56:59.422
Follow the gourd,
the holy gourd of Jerusalem!

56:59.592 --> 57:02.511
- The gourd!
- Hold up the sandal, like he has...

57:02.680 --> 57:05.431
- It is a shoe! It is a shoe!
- It's a sandal!

57:05.599 --> 57:08.600
- No, it isn't! It is a shoe!
- Cast it away!

57:08.769 --> 57:10.228
- Put it on!
- Now clear off.

57:10.396 --> 57:12.472
Take the shoes and follow him!

57:12.648 --> 57:17.987
Come all ye who call
yourselves Gourdenes.

57:18.946 --> 57:20.689
Stop, I say.

57:20.864 --> 57:23.864
Stop. Let us...

57:24.493 --> 57:26.533
Let us pray.

57:26.704 --> 57:33.157
Yea, he cometh to us
like the seed to the grave...

57:54.941 --> 57:56.341
Master!

58:19.799 --> 58:23.844
Hey, is there another way down?

58:24.012 --> 58:27.844
Is there another path down to the river?

58:28.016 --> 58:30.055
Please, please, help me! I've got to get...

58:34.190 --> 58:35.790
My foot!

58:37.026 --> 58:40.609
- Damn! Damn! Damn!
- I'm sorry.

58:40.780 --> 58:44.362
- Damn! Damn and blast it!
- I'm sorry!

58:44.533 --> 58:48.827
Don't you shush me. Eighteen years
of total silence, and you shush me.

58:48.996 --> 58:52.282
- What?
- I've kept my vow for 18 years.

58:52.458 --> 58:56.538
Not a single recognizable,
articulate sound has passed my lips.

58:56.712 --> 58:58.752
Please be quiet
for another five minutes.

58:58.923 --> 59:01.675
It doesn't matter now,
I might as well enjoy myself.

59:01.842 --> 59:05.377
The times in the last 18 years
I wanted to shout and sing...

59:05.554 --> 59:08.970
...and scream my name out!
Oh, I'm alive!

59:16.149 --> 59:20.977
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds! Hello, trees! I'm alive...

59:21.196 --> 59:22.821
Get off! I'm alive!

59:27.536 --> 59:30.536
Master! Master!

59:31.707 --> 59:34.743
The master! He is here!

59:34.918 --> 59:37.326
- The shoe!
- It was the gourd!

59:37.504 --> 59:39.295
The shoe has brought us!

59:39.464 --> 59:42.668
Speak! Speak to us, master!
Speak to us!

59:43.010 --> 59:47.339
- Go away!
- A blessing! A blessing!

59:47.514 --> 59:52.141
- How shall we go away, master?
- Just go away and leave me alone.

59:52.603 --> 59:54.180
Give us a sign.

59:54.354 --> 59:57.770
He has given us a sign,
he has brought us to this place!

59:57.983 --> 01:00:00.653
I didn't bring you here!
You just followed me!

01:00:00.862 --> 01:00:03.567
It's still a good sign,
by any standard.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:06.824
Master, your people have walked
many miles to be with you.

01:00:06.993 --> 01:00:08.820
They are weary and have not eaten.

01:00:09.037 --> 01:00:13.615
- It's not my fault they haven't eaten!
- There is no food in this high mountain.

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:16.917
What about the juniper bushes
over there?

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:20.873
A miracle! A miracle!

01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:24.583
He has made the bush
fruitful by his word!

01:00:24.761 --> 01:00:26.552
They brought forth juniper berries!

01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:29.971
Of course they brought forth
juniper berries, they're juniper bushes.

01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:31.304
What do you expect?!

01:00:31.517 --> 01:00:33.177
Show us another miracle.

01:00:33.353 --> 01:00:35.429
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!

01:00:35.605 --> 01:00:38.392
Is not the miracle
of the juniper bushes enough?

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.350
- I say, those are my juniper bushes.
- They are a gift from God!

01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:45.980
They're all I've bloody got to eat.

01:00:46.158 --> 01:00:50.571
I say, get off of those bushes!
Go on! Clear off, the lot of you.

01:00:50.788 --> 01:00:56.209
- Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
- I'm healed!

01:00:56.377 --> 01:00:59.331
- The master has healed me!
- I didn't touch him!

01:00:59.505 --> 01:01:01.996
I was blind, and now I can see!

01:01:02.174 --> 01:01:06.468
A miracle! A miracle! A miracle!

01:01:08.347 --> 01:01:13.175
Tell them to stop it. I hadn't said a word
for 18 years till he came along.

01:01:13.394 --> 01:01:17.012
A miracle! He is the Messiah!

01:01:17.231 --> 01:01:22.225
- And he hurt my foot!
- Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt mine! Hurt mine!

01:01:22.403 --> 01:01:26.021
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.490
I say you are, Lord.
And I should know, I've followed a few!

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.077
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!

01:01:33.248 --> 01:01:36.451
Would you please listen, I am not
the Messiah, do you understand?

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.286
Honestly!

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:42.746
Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.

01:01:42.966 --> 01:01:46.086
What? Well, what sort of chance
does that give me?

01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:52.264
- All right, I am the Messiah!
- He is! He is the Messiah!

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.682
Now, fuck off!

01:02:02.444 --> 01:02:06.393
- How shall we fuck off, Lord?
- Just go away! Leave me alone!

01:02:06.615 --> 01:02:09.284
You told these people
to eat my juniper berries.

01:02:09.451 --> 01:02:12.368
You break my bloody foot,
you break my vow of silence...

01:02:12.537 --> 01:02:15.112
...and then you try and clean up
on my juniper bushes!

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:19.289
Lay off! This is the Messiah,
the chosen one!

01:02:19.462 --> 01:02:22.416
- No, he's not.
- An unbeliever!

01:02:22.632 --> 01:02:23.830
An unbeliever!

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:29.127
- Persecute! Kill the heretic!
- Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:02:29.764 --> 01:02:32.681
- Kill!
- Leave him alone!

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.009
Leave him alone!

01:02:36.228 --> 01:02:37.343
Leave him alone.

01:02:37.563 --> 01:02:40.398
Put him down. Please!

01:02:44.236 --> 01:02:45.436
Brian?

01:02:45.988 --> 01:02:47.388
Judith?

01:03:34.204 --> 01:03:38.783
Look, there he is!
The chosen one has woken!

01:03:41.044 --> 01:03:42.244
Brian!

01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:45.489
Mother!

01:03:46.009 --> 01:03:49.378
- Brian!
- Hang on, Mother!

01:03:52.265 --> 01:03:55.349
- Hello, Mother.
- Don't you "hello, Mother" me.

01:03:55.518 --> 01:03:58.092
- What are those people doing out there?
- Well, I...

01:03:58.271 --> 01:04:00.310
Come on! What have you
been up to, my lad?

01:04:00.481 --> 01:04:02.770
I think they must have
popped by for something.

01:04:02.942 --> 01:04:08.019
Popped by?! Swelled by, more like.
There's a multitude out there!

01:04:08.197 --> 01:04:09.905
They started following me yesterday.

01:04:10.074 --> 01:04:13.739
Well, they can stop following
you right now.

01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:19.157
Now stop following my son.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

01:04:19.334 --> 01:04:23.996
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!

01:04:24.172 --> 01:04:27.007
- The who?
- The Messiah!

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.420
There's no Messiah in here.
There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.

01:04:31.597 --> 01:04:33.056
Now go away!

01:04:33.265 --> 01:04:35.341
Brian! Brian!

01:04:35.517 --> 01:04:37.843
Right, my lad,
what have you been up to?

01:04:38.062 --> 01:04:39.888
- Nothing, Mum.
- Come on, out with it.

01:04:40.064 --> 01:04:41.890
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.

01:04:42.316 --> 01:04:44.522
- What have you been telling them?
- Nothing, l...

01:04:44.693 --> 01:04:47.647
- You're only making it worse for yourself.
- Look, I can explain...

01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:52.982
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
Your son is a born leader!

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.576
Those people out there are following him
because they believe in him.

01:04:56.747 --> 01:04:58.455
They believe he can
give them hope.

01:04:58.624 --> 01:05:03.582
Hope of a new life,
a new world, a better future!

01:05:04.546 --> 01:05:07.998
- Who's that!?
- That's Judith, Mum.

01:05:08.175 --> 01:05:11.175
Judith, Mother.

01:05:14.474 --> 01:05:16.882
Show us the Messiah!

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:23.850
Now you listen here,
he's not the Messiah!

01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:27.441
He's a very naughty boy! Now go away!

01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:31.568
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother, that's who.

01:05:31.783 --> 01:05:35.995
Behold his mother! Behold his mother!

01:05:36.162 --> 01:05:39.448
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!

01:05:39.624 --> 01:05:43.325
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!

01:05:43.503 --> 01:05:47.880
All things to thee, now and always!

01:05:48.091 --> 01:05:50.962
Now, don't think you can
get around me like that.

01:05:51.136 --> 01:05:54.754
He's not coming out,
and that's my final word.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.300
Now shove off!

01:05:57.517 --> 01:05:58.517
No!

01:05:59.854 --> 01:06:03.437
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes!

01:06:03.899 --> 01:06:07.565
- Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
- Yes!

01:06:08.821 --> 01:06:13.448
All right then, you can see him
for one minute, but not one second more!

01:06:13.618 --> 01:06:16.239
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:06:16.454 --> 01:06:20.498
- Promise?
- Well, all right.

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:24.287
All right, here he is then.
Come on, Brian, come and talk to them.

01:06:24.462 --> 01:06:27.166
- But, Mum, Judith...
- Leave that Welsh tart alone.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.747
I don't really want to, Mum.

01:06:36.766 --> 01:06:40.182
- Good morning!
- A blessing! A blessing!

01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:45.309
No, please. Please, please, listen!

01:06:45.484 --> 01:06:48.189
I've got one or two things to say.

01:06:48.403 --> 01:06:50.811
Tell us! Tell us both of them!

01:06:51.323 --> 01:06:55.949
Look, you've got it all wrong!
You don't need to follow me.

01:06:56.119 --> 01:06:59.654
You don't need to follow anybody!

01:06:59.998 --> 01:07:04.707
You've got to think for yourselves.
You're all individuals!

01:07:04.878 --> 01:07:08.164
Yes, we're all individuals!

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.333
You're all different.

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:13.421
Yes, we are all different!

01:07:13.595 --> 01:07:15.195
I'm not.

01:07:16.556 --> 01:07:20.091
You've all got to work it out
for yourselves!

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:24.390
Yes, we've got to work it
out for ourselves!

01:07:24.648 --> 01:07:26.248
Exactly!

01:07:26.817 --> 01:07:29.984
- Tell us more!
- No, that's the point!

01:07:30.154 --> 01:07:33.239
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!

01:07:33.408 --> 01:07:36.741
- Otherwise... Oh, no!
- That's enough! That's enough.

01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:42.162
That wasn't a minute.

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:46.912
- Oh, yes, it was.
- Oh, no, it wasn't!

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:49.917
Now stop that, and go away.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.172
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

01:07:52.385 --> 01:07:53.713
Are you a virgin?

01:07:54.429 --> 01:07:56.587
I beg your pardon?

01:07:56.973 --> 01:08:01.101
Well, if it's not a personal question,
are you a virgin?

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:06.138
If it's not a personal question?!
How much more personal can you get?

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:08.771
Now piss off.

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:12.525
- She is.
- Must be. Definitely.

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:15.236
Definitely. Definitely.

01:08:18.245 --> 01:08:19.526
Morning, Saviour!

01:08:29.048 --> 01:08:31.171
Lay your hands on me! Quick!

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:34.960
Now, don't jostle the chosen one!
Please!

01:08:35.136 --> 01:08:39.384
Don't push that baby in the
Saviour's face! He'll touch it later!

01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:40.756
I say...

01:08:40.935 --> 01:08:43.176
Could he see my wife?
She has a headache.

01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:44.812
You'll have to wait, I'm afraid!

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:47.305
She's very bad,
and we've got a luncheon!

01:08:47.483 --> 01:08:49.060
Look, the lepers are queuing!

01:08:49.234 --> 01:08:51.856
Her brother-in-law
is the ex-mayor of Gath.

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:55.979
Can I introduce you to the man who's
letting us have the mounts on Sunday?

01:08:56.158 --> 01:08:58.828
- Hello.
- Don't push!

01:08:58.995 --> 01:09:02.115
Now keep the noise down, please!

01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:06.952
Those possessed by devils, try and keep
them under control a bit! Can't you?

01:09:07.127 --> 01:09:10.627
Incurables, you'll just have
to wait for a few minutes.

01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:14.926
Women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:16.295
Brian?

01:09:17.138 --> 01:09:19.712
Brian! You were fantastic!

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:23.094
- You weren't so bad yourself.
- No, what you said just now!

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:26.020
- Quite extraordinary!
- What? Oh, that. Was it?

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:30.353
We don't need leaders! You're so right!
Reg has been dominating us for too long.

01:09:30.527 --> 01:09:34.062
- Well, yes...
- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian!

01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:35.698
You're very attractive.

01:09:35.865 --> 01:09:38.902
It's our revolution!
We can all do it together!

01:09:39.077 --> 01:09:40.120
I think...

01:09:40.287 --> 01:09:43.787
We're all behind you, Brian!
The revolution is in your hands!

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:47.327
What?
No, that's not what I meant at all!

01:09:47.502 --> 01:09:50.752
You're fucking nicked, me old beauty!

01:09:50.923 --> 01:09:52.122
Right!

01:09:58.806 --> 01:09:59.921
Stop it!

01:10:02.768 --> 01:10:05.603
Well, Brian, you've given us
a good run for our money.

01:10:05.771 --> 01:10:07.171
A what?

01:10:07.857 --> 01:10:12.435
And this time,
I guarantee you will not escape.

01:10:12.612 --> 01:10:17.320
Guard!
Do we have any crucifixions today?

01:10:17.491 --> 01:10:20.991
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

01:10:21.162 --> 01:10:26.998
Right! Now we have 140!
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?

01:10:28.378 --> 01:10:30.287
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail!

01:10:30.464 --> 01:10:34.378
The crowd are getting restless, sir.
Permission to disperse them, please.

01:10:35.177 --> 01:10:37.964
Disperse them?
But I haven't addressed them yet!

01:10:38.138 --> 01:10:39.632
No, I know, sir, but...

01:10:39.806 --> 01:10:41.680
My address is a high point
of Passover!

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:45.136
My friend Biggus Dickus has come
all the way from Rome to hear it!

01:10:45.312 --> 01:10:47.933
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:50.979
You're not...

01:10:51.151 --> 01:10:54.602
You're not thinking of giving
it a miss this year, then, sir?

01:10:55.322 --> 01:10:56.733
Give it a miss?!

01:10:56.907 --> 01:11:00.192
Well, it's just that they're
in a rather funny mood today, sir.

01:11:00.369 --> 01:11:01.483
Really, centurion!

01:11:01.662 --> 01:11:05.790
I'm surprised to hear a man like you
rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels.

01:11:06.124 --> 01:11:08.794
- A bit thundery, sir.
- Take him away!

01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:11.796
I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!

01:11:11.964 --> 01:11:15.049
And crucify him well!

01:11:15.468 --> 01:11:16.868
Biggus!

01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:20.510
- I really wouldn't, sir!
- Out of the way, centurion!

01:11:20.682 --> 01:11:25.557
Let me come with you, Pontius. I may be
of assistance if there is a sudden crisis!

01:11:27.438 --> 01:11:31.436
Right! Now, item four: Attainment of world
supremacy within the next five years.

01:11:31.609 --> 01:11:34.694
- Francis, you've done some work on this?
- Yeah, thank you, Reg.

01:11:34.862 --> 01:11:38.113
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

01:11:38.283 --> 01:11:41.319
...unless we can smash the Roman
Empire within the next 12 months!

01:11:41.494 --> 01:11:43.154
- Twelve months?
- Yeah, 12 months.

01:11:43.329 --> 01:11:47.078
And let's face it, as empires go,
this is the big one.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.117
So we gotta get up off our arses
and stop just talking about it!

01:11:51.296 --> 01:11:52.338
Hear! Hear!

01:11:52.505 --> 01:11:56.123
I agree! It's action that counts,
not words, and we need action now!

01:11:56.718 --> 01:12:00.503
You're right. We could sit around here
all day, talking, passing resolutions...

01:12:00.681 --> 01:12:04.548
...making clever speeches,
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!

01:12:04.727 --> 01:12:08.096
So let's just stop gabbing on about it!
It's completely pointless...

01:12:08.272 --> 01:12:10.264
...and it's getting us nowhere!
- Right!

01:12:10.441 --> 01:12:12.896
I agree!
This is a complete waste of time!

01:12:14.236 --> 01:12:15.434
They've arrested Brian!

01:12:15.613 --> 01:12:17.652
- What?
- They've dragged him off!

01:12:17.823 --> 01:12:19.365
They're gonna crucify him!

01:12:19.533 --> 01:12:23.032
Right!
This calls for immediate discussion!

01:12:23.203 --> 01:12:24.246
- What?!
- Immediate!

01:12:24.413 --> 01:12:25.456
- Right!
- New motion?

01:12:25.623 --> 01:12:31.079
Completely new motion!
That there be immediate action...

01:12:31.253 --> 01:12:32.664
Once the vote has been taken.

01:12:32.838 --> 01:12:35.673
Obviously once the vote's been taken.
Can't act on a resolution...

01:12:35.841 --> 01:12:38.130
- Reg, let's go now, please!
- Right! Right!

01:12:38.302 --> 01:12:42.596
In the light of fresh information
from sibling Judith...

01:12:42.766 --> 01:12:44.758
- Not so fast, Reg.
- Reg, for God's sake!

01:12:44.934 --> 01:12:46.974
It's perfectly simple!

01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:50.063
All you've gotta do is to go out
of that door now...

01:12:50.273 --> 01:12:52.847
...and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

01:12:53.026 --> 01:12:54.485
It's happening, Reg!

01:12:54.653 --> 01:12:59.647
Something's actually happening, Reg!
Can't you understand?

01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:08.740
- Yeah, hello.
- Another little ego trip from the feminists.

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:11.490
- What?
- Sorry, Loretta.

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.579
Read that back, would you?

01:13:26.768 --> 01:13:27.768
Next.

01:13:28.396 --> 01:13:29.806
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.

01:13:29.981 --> 01:13:34.726
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

01:13:34.902 --> 01:13:35.902
Next.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.565
Crucifixion?

01:13:37.738 --> 01:13:43.278
Good. Out of the door, line on the left,
one cross each. Next.

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:46.453
- Crucifixion?
- No, freedom.

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:47.867
- What?
- Freedom for me.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.370
They said I hadn't done anything
so I could go free and live on an island.

01:13:53.587 --> 01:13:55.580
That's jolly good.
Well, off you go, then.

01:13:55.756 --> 01:13:58.710
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.

01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:00.711
I see. Very good, very good.

01:14:00.886 --> 01:14:02.049
Well, out of the door.

01:14:02.221 --> 01:14:04.629
Out of the door,
one cross each, line on the left.

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:07.927
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.
Crucifixion?

01:14:08.102 --> 01:14:09.347
- Yes.
- Good.

01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:26.446
People of Jerusalem!

01:14:28.165 --> 01:14:31.119
Rome is your friend!

01:14:36.173 --> 01:14:40.005
To prove our friendship,
it is customary at this time...

01:14:40.177 --> 01:14:44.755
...to release a wrongdoer
from our prisons.

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:52.683
Whom would you have me release?

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:55.656
Release Roger!

01:14:56.026 --> 01:14:59.811
Release Roger! Release Roger!

01:15:02.659 --> 01:15:07.321
Very well, I shall release Roger!

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:12.581
Sir, we don't have a Roger, sir.

01:15:12.752 --> 01:15:16.666
- What?
- We don't have anyone of that name, sir.

01:15:16.839 --> 01:15:19.627
We have no Roger!

01:15:22.595 --> 01:15:25.051
But what about Roderick, then?

01:15:25.223 --> 01:15:28.888
Release Roderick! Release Roderick!

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:33.805
Centurion, why do they titter so?

01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:37.729
Just some Jewish joke, sir.

01:15:39.153 --> 01:15:42.274
Are they ragging me?

01:15:43.867 --> 01:15:46.156
Oh, no, sir!

01:15:47.496 --> 01:15:51.825
Very well. I shall release Roderick!

01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:53.910
Sir, we don't have a Roderick either.

01:15:54.086 --> 01:15:57.206
- No Roger, no Roderick?
- Sorry, sir.

01:15:57.381 --> 01:16:02.173
Who is this...?
Who is this Roderick to whom you refer?

01:16:02.344 --> 01:16:03.922
He is a robber!

01:16:05.306 --> 01:16:07.906
And a rapist!

01:16:08.475 --> 01:16:11.875
And a pickpocket!

01:16:13.605 --> 01:16:15.432
He sounds a notorious criminal.

01:16:15.608 --> 01:16:17.351
We haven't got him, sir.

01:16:18.402 --> 01:16:20.193
Do we have anyone in our prisons?

01:16:20.362 --> 01:16:22.189
- We've got a Samson, sir.
- Samson?

01:16:22.364 --> 01:16:27.360
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Silas the Syrian Assassin.

01:16:27.537 --> 01:16:31.405
Several seditious scribes
from Caesarea.

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:32.626
Sixty-seven...

01:16:32.792 --> 01:16:35.165
- Let me speak to them, Pontius!
- Oh, no!

01:16:35.337 --> 01:16:36.831
Good idea, Biggus!

01:16:37.005 --> 01:16:43.719
Citizens! We have Samson the Sadducee
Strangler, Silas the Assyrian Assassin...

01:16:43.887 --> 01:16:47.885
...several seditious scribes
from Caesarea...

01:16:48.058 --> 01:16:49.058
Next.

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:52.386
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.

01:16:52.562 --> 01:16:56.774
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each. Jailor?

01:16:56.942 --> 01:17:00.607
- Excuse me? There's been a mistake...
- Just a moment, would you? Jailor?

01:17:00.779 --> 01:17:04.728
- How many have come through?
- What?

01:17:04.908 --> 01:17:07.743
How many have come through?

01:17:07.911 --> 01:17:08.911
What?

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.158
You'll have to speak...

01:17:15.044 --> 01:17:18.709
Speak up, sir.
He's... He's d...

01:17:18.881 --> 01:17:22.926
He's deaf... Deaf as a post, sir.

01:17:23.094 --> 01:17:26.878
How many have come through?

01:17:30.142 --> 01:17:32.812
- Oh, dear.
- I make it 90...

01:17:32.979 --> 01:17:34.603
Ninety...

01:17:34.772 --> 01:17:36.314
Ninety...

01:17:37.483 --> 01:17:39.392
Ninety-six, sir.

01:17:39.568 --> 01:17:42.059
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

01:17:42.238 --> 01:17:43.838
No, sir!

01:17:44.573 --> 01:17:48.654
Not with these b...
Bastards, sir!

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:56.868
Crucifixion's too good for them, sir.

01:17:57.045 --> 01:17:59.583
I don't think you could
say it's good, it's nasty!

01:17:59.756 --> 01:18:01.879
It's not as n...

01:18:04.803 --> 01:18:08.172
Not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

01:18:08.348 --> 01:18:11.468
- Now, crucifixion?
- Is there someone I could speak to?

01:18:11.643 --> 01:18:15.012
- Well...
- I know where to get it if you want it.

01:18:15.188 --> 01:18:19.352
- What?
- Don't worry about him, sir. He's de...

01:18:21.945 --> 01:18:24.436
He's deaf and mad, sir.

01:18:24.615 --> 01:18:26.274
Well, how did he get the job?

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:28.822
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!

01:18:28.994 --> 01:18:33.122
Get a move on, big nose! There's people
waiting to be crucified out here!

01:18:33.624 --> 01:18:35.450
Could I see a lawyer or someone?

01:18:35.626 --> 01:18:37.702
- Do you have a lawyer?
- No, but I'm a Roman.

01:18:37.878 --> 01:18:40.285
How about a retrial?
We've got plenty of time.

01:18:40.797 --> 01:18:43.005
- Shut up, you!
- Miserable, bloody Romans!

01:18:43.176 --> 01:18:45.334
No sense of humour.

01:18:45.511 --> 01:18:46.554
Sorry, bit of a hurry.

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:51.182
Can you go straight out,
line on the left, one cross each? Now...

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:03.187
Was it something I said?

01:19:04.864 --> 01:19:06.464
Silence!

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:13.121
This man commands a crack legion!

01:19:17.293 --> 01:19:20.294
He ranks as high as any in Rome!

01:19:24.968 --> 01:19:26.463
Crucifixion party?

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:29.598
Morning.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:34.142
Now, we will be on show as we go through
the town, so let's not let the side down!

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:37.514
Keep in a line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.516
...and a good, steady pace.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:43.476
Crosses over your left shoulders,
and if you keep your backs hard up...

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:47.153
...against the crossbeam
you'll be there in no time.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:48.439
All right, centurion!

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.859
Crucifixion party!

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.029
Wait for it.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:55.577
Crucifixion party!

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:59.877
By the left! Forward!

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:05.664
You lucky bastards!

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:10.795
You lucky, jabby bastards!

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:22.108
Let me shoulder your burden, brother!

01:20:22.277 --> 01:20:24.277
Thank you.

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:28.692
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?

01:20:28.867 --> 01:20:29.946
It's not my cross...

01:20:30.118 --> 01:20:34.282
Shut up and get on with it!
Come on!

01:20:34.456 --> 01:20:38.999
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson!

01:20:39.628 --> 01:20:41.628
All right!

01:20:41.963 --> 01:20:44.252
I will give you one more chance!

01:20:44.424 --> 01:20:50.628
This time I want to hear
no Rubens, no Reginalds...

01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:53.890
...no Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeers.

01:20:54.059 --> 01:20:56.051
No Spencer Tracys!

01:20:56.228 --> 01:20:58.138
Or we shall release no one!

01:20:58.314 --> 01:20:59.974
Release Brian!

01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:01.560
Yeah, that's a good one!

01:21:01.734 --> 01:21:06.443
Release Brian! Release Brian!

01:21:07.406 --> 01:21:09.280
Very well! That's it!

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:11.775
- Sir, we have got a Brian, sir.
- What?

01:21:11.953 --> 01:21:17.195
- You just sent him for crucifixion, sir!
- Wait! Wait! We do have a Brian.

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:20.625
- Well, go and free him, straight away!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:21:23.005 --> 01:21:28.925
Very well. I shall release Brian!

01:21:32.473 --> 01:21:34.964
- Get a move on, there!
- Or what?

01:21:35.142 --> 01:21:36.423
Or you'll be in trouble!

01:21:36.602 --> 01:21:40.979
Oh, dear. You mean I might have to
give up being crucified in the afternoons?

01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:43.522
- Shut up!
- That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

01:21:43.694 --> 01:21:45.651
I wouldn't have nothing to do!

01:21:45.821 --> 01:21:47.279
Thank you!

01:21:50.367 --> 01:21:52.525
Are they gone?

01:21:53.412 --> 01:21:57.659
We've got lumps of it around the back.

01:21:57.833 --> 01:21:58.833
What?

01:21:59.084 --> 01:22:01.789
Don't worry about him sir,
he's ma...

01:22:06.842 --> 01:22:10.293
- He's mad, sir.
- Have they gone?

01:22:19.646 --> 01:22:22.647
- Oh, come on.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:23.275 --> 01:22:27.190
- Anyway, get on with the story.
- Well, I just never really liked them, so l...

01:22:28.323 --> 01:22:31.027
Right! The motion to get on with it
passed with one abstention.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.656
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a second?

01:22:33.828 --> 01:22:35.986
- Let's just go.
- Yeah.

01:22:51.638 --> 01:22:56.299
- Bloody Romans!
- Watch it! Still a few crosses left!

01:22:58.019 --> 01:23:00.592
Up you go, big nose!

01:23:00.772 --> 01:23:02.480
I'll get you for this, you bastard!

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:06.064
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah, don't worry. I never forget a face.

01:23:06.235 --> 01:23:07.813
- No?
- I warn you.

01:23:07.987 --> 01:23:11.238
I'm gonna punch you so hard,
you Roman git!

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:13.567
Shut up, you Jewish turd!

01:23:13.744 --> 01:23:17.824
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!

01:23:17.998 --> 01:23:20.916
A Samaritan? This is supposed
to be a Jewish section!

01:23:21.085 --> 01:23:24.833
It doesn't matter!
You're all gonna die in a day or two!

01:23:25.005 --> 01:23:28.421
It may not matter to you,
but it matters to us. Doesn't it, darling?

01:23:28.592 --> 01:23:29.837
Oh, rather!

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.050
Under the terms
of the Roman occupancy...

01:23:32.262 --> 01:23:35.263
...we're entitled to be crucified
in a purely Jewish area.

01:23:35.432 --> 01:23:37.591
Pharisees separate from Sadducees!

01:23:37.768 --> 01:23:39.891
And Swedish separate from Welsh!

01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:44.973
All right, all right, all right!
We'll soon settle this!

01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:50.690
Hands up, all those who
don't want to be crucified here!

01:23:50.864 --> 01:23:52.691
Right! Next!

01:23:52.866 --> 01:23:55.952
- Look, it's not my cross.
- What?

01:23:56.121 --> 01:23:58.409
It's not my cross,
I was holding it for someone.

01:23:58.581 --> 01:24:03.125
- Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
- Of course. Look, I hate to make a fuss...

01:24:03.295 --> 01:24:06.414
Look, we've had a busy day,
and there's 140 of you lot to get up.

01:24:06.589 --> 01:24:09.045
- Is he Jewish?
- Will you be quiet?!

01:24:09.217 --> 01:24:11.340
We don't want more
Samaritans around here.

01:24:11.511 --> 01:24:12.756
Belt up!

01:24:12.929 --> 01:24:16.512
- Will you let me down if he comes back?
- Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down.

01:24:16.683 --> 01:24:18.307
- Next!
- You don't have to do this!

01:24:18.476 --> 01:24:22.604
- You don't have to take orders!
- I like orders.

01:24:44.378 --> 01:24:47.165
See? Not so bad once you're up.

01:24:48.132 --> 01:24:51.999
- You're being rescued then, are you?
- It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?

01:24:52.178 --> 01:24:54.135
No, we've got a couple of days up here.

01:24:54.305 --> 01:24:56.463
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

01:24:57.683 --> 01:24:59.806
Oh, yeah.
My brother usually rescues me.

01:24:59.977 --> 01:25:02.812
If he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:07.060
Randy little bugger.
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.

01:25:11.864 --> 01:25:14.236
Hello. Your family arrived then?

01:25:14.408 --> 01:25:15.408
Reg!

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.945
- Hello, sibling Brian.
- Thank God you've come, Reg.

01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:23.617
I think I should point out in fairness
that we are not the rescue committee.

01:25:23.793 --> 01:25:26.748
However, I have been asked to read
this prepared statement...

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:28.630
...on behalf of the movement.

01:25:28.799 --> 01:25:32.049
"We, the People's Front of Judea,
brackets, officials, end brackets...

01:25:32.219 --> 01:25:36.715
...do hereby convey our sincere fraternal
and sisterly greetings to you, Brian...

01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:40.140
...on this occasion of your martyrdom."
- What?

01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:43.928
"Your death will stand as a landmark
in the continuing struggle to liberate...

01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:47.605
...the parent land from the hands
of the Roman imperialist aggressors...

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:51.026
...excluding those concerned with
drainage, medicine, roads, housing...

01:25:51.196 --> 01:25:55.657
...education. And any other Romans
contributing to the welfare of Jews...

01:25:55.826 --> 01:25:58.317
...of both sexes
and hermaphrodites."

01:25:58.495 --> 01:26:01.413
Signed, "On behalf of the P.F.J.,
et cetera."

01:26:01.581 --> 01:26:04.701
And I'd just like to add, on
a personal note, my own admiration...

01:26:04.876 --> 01:26:10.252
...for what you're doing for us and what
must be, after all, for you, a difficult time.

01:26:10.425 --> 01:26:14.837
- Reg! What are you going to do?
- Goodbye, Brian. And thanks.

01:26:16.723 --> 01:26:18.715
All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.

01:26:18.891 --> 01:26:21.299
Terrific work, Brian.

01:26:26.607 --> 01:26:28.434
Right. And:

01:26:28.609 --> 01:26:30.816
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:26:30.987 --> 01:26:33.063
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:36.026
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.193
<i>And so say all of us</i>

01:26:38.369 --> 01:26:41.039
<i>And so say all of...</i>

01:26:44.125 --> 01:26:47.292
You bastards! You bastards!

01:26:47.462 --> 01:26:50.581
- Where is Brian of Nazareth?
- You sanctimonious bastards!

01:26:50.757 --> 01:26:54.671
- I have an order for his release.
- You stupid bastards!

01:26:54.844 --> 01:26:56.885
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- What?

01:26:57.056 --> 01:26:58.764
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- Take him down!

01:26:58.932 --> 01:27:00.640
I'm Brian of Nazareth!

01:27:01.268 --> 01:27:03.890
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!

01:27:04.063 --> 01:27:05.936
Look, look, I'm Brian!

01:27:06.106 --> 01:27:09.191
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian and so is my wife!

01:27:12.279 --> 01:27:16.858
- Right! Take him away and release him!
- No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian.

01:27:17.034 --> 01:27:20.237
No, I'm not Brian! I was only...
It was a joke.

01:27:20.412 --> 01:27:22.986
I'm only pulling your leg!
It's a joke!

01:27:23.165 --> 01:27:25.573
I'm not him,
I'm just having you on!

01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:29.452
Put me back!
Bloody Romans, can't take a joke.

01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:41.182
The Judean People's Front!

01:27:42.227 --> 01:27:44.599
The Judean People's Front!

01:27:44.771 --> 01:27:47.371
Forward, all!

01:27:51.736 --> 01:27:56.897
- Look out! The Judean People's Front!
- The Judean People's Front!

01:27:57.075 --> 01:27:59.696
The Judean People's Front!

01:28:03.748 --> 01:28:08.956
We are the Judean People's Front,
crack suicide squad.

01:28:09.129 --> 01:28:13.423
Suicide squad, attack!

01:28:21.975 --> 01:28:24.977
That showed them, huh?

01:28:25.771 --> 01:28:28.262
You silly sods!

01:28:28.441 --> 01:28:29.641
Brian!

01:28:34.196 --> 01:28:35.596
Judith!

01:28:36.407 --> 01:28:42.196
Terrific! Great! Reg explained it to me,
and I think it's great what you're doing.

01:28:42.371 --> 01:28:46.784
Thank you, Brian. I'll never forget you.

01:28:55.092 --> 01:28:57.797
So there you are!

01:28:57.970 --> 01:29:00.212
I might have known
it would end up like this.

01:29:00.389 --> 01:29:04.387
Just think of all the love
and affection I've wasted on you!

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.265
Well, if that's how you treat
your poor, old mother...

01:29:07.438 --> 01:29:10.855
...in the autumn years of her life,
all I can say is:

01:29:11.026 --> 01:29:15.071
Go ahead. Be crucified.
See if I care.

01:29:15.238 --> 01:29:20.280
- I might have known.
- Mum! Mum!

01:29:20.452 --> 01:29:22.610
I don't know what
the world is coming to.

01:29:27.918 --> 01:29:29.460
Cheer up, Brian!

01:29:29.628 --> 01:29:31.834
You know what they say?

01:29:32.005 --> 01:29:34.792
Some things in life are bad.

01:29:34.967 --> 01:29:37.588
They can really make you mad.

01:29:37.761 --> 01:29:41.675
Other things just make
you swear and curse.

01:29:41.848 --> 01:29:44.221
<i>When you're chewing on life's gristle</i>

01:29:44.393 --> 01:29:47.809
<i>Don't grumble</i>
<i>Give a whistle</i>

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:52.392
<i>And this'll help things</i>
<i>Turn out for the best</i>

01:29:52.567 --> 01:29:54.524
<i>And</i>

01:29:54.624 --> 01:30:00.524
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

01:30:02.787 --> 01:30:08.374
<i>Always look on the light side of life</i>

01:30:10.044 --> 01:30:12.120
<i>If life seems jolly rotten</i>

01:30:12.297 --> 01:30:14.088
<i>There's something you've forgotten</i>

01:30:14.257 --> 01:30:17.957
<i>And that's to laugh and smile</i>
<i>And dance and sing</i>

01:30:18.136 --> 01:30:19.963
<i>When you're feeling in the dumps</i>

01:30:20.138 --> 01:30:22.344
<i>Don't be silly chumps</i>

01:30:22.515 --> 01:30:25.551
<i>Just purse your lips and whistle</i>
<i>That's the thing</i>

01:30:25.727 --> 01:30:32.180
<i>And always look on</i>
<i>The bright side of life</i>

01:30:32.358 --> 01:30:33.958
Come on!

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:39.736
<i>Always look on the right side of life</i>

01:30:42.411 --> 01:30:44.202
<i>For life is quite absurd</i>

01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:46.115
<i>And death's the final word</i>

01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:50.038
<i>You must always face</i>
<i>The curtain with a bow</i>

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:52.084
<i>Forget about your sin</i>

01:30:52.254 --> 01:30:54.330
<i>Give the audience a grin</i>

01:30:54.506 --> 01:30:57.591
<i>Enjoy it</i>
<i>It's your last chance anyhow</i>

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:03.465
<i>So always look on</i>
<i>The bright side of death</i>

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:11.436
<i>Just before</i>
<i>You draw your terminal breath</i>

01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:16.437
<i>Life's a piece of shit</i>

01:31:16.612 --> 01:31:18.403
<i>When you look at it</i>

01:31:18.572 --> 01:31:22.273
<i>Life's a laugh and death's a joke
<i>It's true</i></i>

01:31:22.451 --> 01:31:24.159
<i>You'll see it's all a show</i>

01:31:24.329 --> 01:31:26.203
<i>Keep 'em laughing as you go</i>

01:31:26.373 --> 01:31:30.038
<i>Just remember that</i>
<i>The last laugh is on you</i>

01:31:30.210 --> 01:31:36.497
<i>And always look on</i>
<i>The bright side of life</i>

01:31:38.843 --> 01:31:43.838
<i>Always look on the right side of life</i>

01:31:44.015 --> 01:31:46.720
Come on, Brian! Cheer up!

01:31:46.893 --> 01:31:52.480
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

01:31:54.734 --> 01:31:59.527
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

01:31:59.698 --> 01:32:02.615
Worse things happen at sea,
you know?

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:05.904
<i>Always look on the bright side of life</i>

01:32:06.079 --> 01:32:08.487
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing...

01:32:08.665 --> 01:32:10.658
...you're going back to nothing,
what have you lost?

01:32:10.835 --> 01:32:12.210
Nothing!

01:32:16.007 --> 01:32:18.711
Nothing will come from nothing,
you know what they say?

01:32:18.884 --> 01:32:20.462
Cheer up, you old bugger!

01:32:20.636 --> 01:32:23.210
Come on! Give us a grin!
There you are!

01:32:23.389 --> 01:32:28.549
See? The end of the film. Incidentally,
this record is available in the foyer.

01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:32.639
Some of us have got to live
as well, you know?

01:32:32.815 --> 01:32:35.769
Who do you think pays
for all this rubbish?

01:32:35.943 --> 01:32:38.565
They're not gonna make
their money back, you know.

01:32:38.738 --> 01:32:40.481
I told them. I said to him.

01:32:40.754 --> 01:32:44.072
"Bernie," I said,
"They'll never make their money back."
