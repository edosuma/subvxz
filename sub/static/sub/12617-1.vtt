He Played For That Trophy.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.001
He Reminds Me About It
Every Day.

10:37.034 --> 10:39.871
Twice A Day, Whether
I Need To Hear It Or Not.

10:39.904 --> 10:41.139
The Mighty Apple Is Ugly.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.509
Ok, Guys, One More Game.
Winner Pays.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.711
But You Always Win, And
Your Dad Doesn't Charge You.

10:46.745 --> 10:48.214
Nice Arrangement, Huh?

10:53.350 --> 10:55.320
It's All Tied Up, Jeff.

10:55.352 --> 10:57.021
Fun, Huh?

10:57.054 --> 10:58.022
We'll Check The Charter

10:58.056 --> 10:59.658
For The Tiebreaker
Tomorrow, Mayor,

10:59.691 --> 11:01.761
But The Momentum Is Ours.

11:04.696 --> 11:06.498
He Knows Something.
I Can Tell.

11:06.530 --> 11:07.498
Hey.

11:07.532 --> 11:10.002
Now, That Was
A Fantastic Finish, Huh?

11:10.034 --> 11:12.336
Sweet Lou Wants To
Interview You Tomorrow,

11:12.370 --> 11:14.505
 And I've Set Up A Meeting
 With<I> Appleton News</I> Again.

11:14.538 --> 11:16.008
It'll Be Just Like
When You Won

11:16.041 --> 11:19.011
The Baseball Championship
With That Homer! Mmh!

11:19.043 --> 11:20.846
Maybe I'll Call Around

11:20.879 --> 11:22.848
And See If We Can Get
Some Regional Coverage.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.682
Whatever,
But Let's Go Home.

11:24.716 --> 11:25.683
I'm Beat.

11:25.716 --> 11:27.351
Oh, I Am So Proud
Of You!

11:27.384 --> 11:28.352
Thanks, Mom.

11:28.385 --> 11:29.353
Last Ball
In The Tenth Frame,

11:29.386 --> 11:31.022
And Alex Thompson
Needs A Strike

11:31.056 --> 11:32.758
To Win The
U.S. Bowling Open.

11:35.226 --> 11:36.194
Good Release...

11:36.227 --> 11:37.562
Steady And True...

11:40.899 --> 11:43.769
See? I Can Make
The Big Shot, Too.

11:43.802 --> 11:45.204
Maybe You'll
Turn Pro One Day.

11:45.236 --> 11:47.538
Nah. Not Interested.
Thanks.

11:47.572 --> 11:50.241
Come On, Champ.
Let's Go Home.

11:51.442 --> 11:54.045
Alex Voice-Over: I Got My Love
Of Bowling From My Dad,

11:54.078 --> 11:57.215
But Sometimes Love And Money
Don't Go Hand In Hand.

11:57.249 --> 12:00.451
I Would Be Really Sad If We
Had To Close The Place.

12:00.485 --> 12:03.221
Nobody Seems To Want
To Bowl Anymore.

12:03.254 --> 12:04.123
Hey, What's Up?

12:04.155 --> 12:05.123
Right On, Baby.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.125
Right On.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.225
All Right, Todd.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.560
It Was Nothing.
It Was Nothing.

12:08.592 --> 12:10.394
All Right.
Thank You. Thank You.

12:10.427 --> 12:11.462
Hey, Todd.

12:11.495 --> 12:13.231
You Were So Great
Last Night.

12:13.264 --> 12:15.399
We've Been Talking
About You All Day.

12:15.432 --> 12:16.802
Yeah?

12:16.835 --> 12:18.604
So, Are You Coming
To My Party?

12:18.636 --> 12:19.604
Wouldn't Miss It.

12:19.638 --> 12:20.605
We'll Be There.

12:20.639 --> 12:21.606
No Doubt, Man.

12:21.639 --> 12:23.641
Great. See You There?

12:23.674 --> 12:24.943
Definitely.

12:27.846 --> 12:30.249
Ah, Mr. Morris.
So What's Gonna Happen

12:30.282 --> 12:31.416
To The Mighty Apple

12:31.448 --> 12:32.416
Since We Ended Up Tied?

12:32.450 --> 12:33.985
We're Not Gonna Be Tied
For Long.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.120
What, They're Gonna
Finally Throw Out

12:35.153 --> 12:38.090
The Girls' Cross-Country
Score?

12:38.123 --> 12:39.958
Those Slimy
East Appleton People.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.593
They Called, They Spoke.

12:42.626 --> 12:44.129
And What Did They Say?

12:45.996 --> 12:46.964
Bowling.

12:46.998 --> 12:48.467
[Bell Rings]

12:48.500 --> 12:50.870
[Mouths Word]

12:52.136 --> 12:53.271
They Can't Get Away
With This.

12:53.304 --> 12:56.307
We'll Sue The East!
We'll Sue Them!

12:56.341 --> 12:58.610
It's Only A Trophy,
Jeff.

12:58.643 --> 13:00.445
After All Of Todd's
Hard Work This Year,

13:00.477 --> 13:02.480
We're Gonna Lose
The Mighty Apple
Because Of Bowling?

13:02.514 --> 13:03.615
I Can't Allow It!

13:03.648 --> 13:04.649
You Saw The Charter.

13:04.682 --> 13:06.317
Both Schools
Have Bowling Clubs.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.352
And Bowling Is The Only
Tiebreaker Listed

13:08.385 --> 13:10.488
Where We Both Have Teams.
We Have No Choice.

13:10.522 --> 13:11.790
All Right,
We'll Hold Tryouts.

13:11.822 --> 13:12.990
We'll Load The Team
With Talent.

13:13.024 --> 13:14.993
No Tryouts. We Have
To Field Our Team

13:15.025 --> 13:16.828
Based On Who Signed Up
For Bowling Club

13:16.861 --> 13:18.163
At The Beginning Of The Year.

13:18.196 --> 13:19.197
Oh...

13:19.230 --> 13:20.465
On The Plus Side,
We Won The Coin Toss,

13:20.498 --> 13:22.367
And We Get
Home Alley Advantage.

13:22.399 --> 13:25.002
Anyway, Maybe The Team
Will Be Good.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.971
Oh, Yeah, Right.
Think Of Our Alley.

13:27.004 --> 13:28.472
Think Of Kevin Thompson,
For Pete's Sake.

13:28.505 --> 13:30.341
Then Ask Yourself,
What Type Of Losers

13:30.375 --> 13:32.577
Are Members Of
The Bowling Club?

13:36.014 --> 13:37.416
[Groans]

13:43.855 --> 13:45.724
Why Does It Matter Who Else
Signed Up For Bowling Club?

13:45.756 --> 13:47.825
We're The Only Ones
Who Ever Show Up.

13:47.859 --> 13:50.162
The Club List
Is Here Somewhere.

13:50.195 --> 13:52.831
You Guys Don't Think
We Can Beat The East.

13:52.864 --> 13:54.233
Is That What's Going On?

13:54.265 --> 13:55.500
We Never Said That.

13:55.533 --> 13:56.835
We Simply Wish
To Explore

13:56.868 --> 13:58.837
And Find Out
All The Options.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.039
Mr. Morris, We're Good.

14:03.041 --> 14:07.012
Oh, Hurrah, Hurrah,
And Yay!

14:07.044 --> 14:08.613
There's A Fifth Bowler.

14:09.447 --> 14:10.849
Todd Mclemore
Is On The List.

14:10.881 --> 14:13.218
[All Laugh]

14:16.721 --> 14:18.557
Golden Boy's In
The Bowling Club?

14:18.590 --> 14:19.691
I'm In Bowling Club?!

14:19.724 --> 14:22.860
You Signed Up At The
Beginning Of The Year.

14:22.894 --> 14:23.861
Have You Forgotten?

14:23.894 --> 14:26.030
I'm In Bowling Club?!

14:26.063 --> 14:28.432
This Is Fantastic
And Good News.

14:28.466 --> 14:32.236
Maybe We Can
Beat East Appleton
After All, Huh?

14:32.269 --> 14:35.274
I'm In Bowling Club?!

14:36.474 --> 14:38.543
Flip Made Me
Sign You Up.
He Made Me.

14:38.576 --> 14:40.479
It Was Leo's Idea.
Honest.

14:56.094 --> 14:57.963
You Know, This
Is Great News, Alex.

14:57.995 --> 14:59.398
This Is Not
Great News.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.466
Your Mom And Her Dad
Think It Is.

15:01.499 --> 15:03.769
You Know, Grandpa Might
Be Out Of The Hospital

15:03.802 --> 15:04.970
In Time For Them Both

15:05.003 --> 15:06.605
To Make It Back
For The Match.

15:06.638 --> 15:08.907
Plus, It Could Be Big Things
For The Alley Here.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.243
But I Like Bowling Because
It Isn't The Next Big Thing.

15:11.275 --> 15:14.111
Never Has Been
And Never Will Be.

15:14.144 --> 15:15.980
When I Was Your Age,
Bowling Was The Thing To Do.

15:16.014 --> 15:18.649
It's Only Cool
To You Now, My Friend,

15:18.682 --> 15:20.619
Because It Was Cool
To Us Then.

15:30.662 --> 15:31.997
I Guess So.

15:32.029 --> 15:35.466
If It's Good For The Alley,
Then Fine.

15:38.702 --> 15:40.805
Sweet Lou
Back On The Air Here

15:40.839 --> 15:43.475
At Wwap With Todd Mclemore.

15:43.508 --> 15:46.945
Todd, It Appears You Have
No Time To Rest On Your Laurels.

15:46.977 --> 15:48.479
The Mighty Apple Is Gonna Go

15:48.513 --> 15:50.949
To The Town Whose School
Bowls Best.

15:50.981 --> 15:52.985
I've Led Our School To
Victories In Basketball,

15:53.018 --> 15:54.987
Baseball, Tennis,
Football, And Track.

15:55.019 --> 15:56.788
I Don't See Why Bowling
Will Be Any Different.

15:56.821 --> 15:59.490
Ok, Spoken Like
A True Competitor.

15:59.524 --> 16:02.326
But Let Me Ask You,
Can You Bowl?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.695
Do You Bowl?

16:03.727 --> 16:05.463
Have You Bowled?

16:05.496 --> 16:07.966
Come On, Sweet Lou.
Everyone Bowls.

16:07.999 --> 16:10.402
I Can Do This.
Trust Me.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.845
Good Job, Alex.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.146
Another One?

16:21.178 --> 16:22.480
You Gotta Be Kidding Me.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.649
Alex Is Pretty Good
There, Jeff.

16:24.682 --> 16:26.350
Think Your Son
Can Keep Up?

16:26.384 --> 16:28.986
Oh, We Mclemores
Have A Long History

16:29.019 --> 16:30.154
Of Rising
To The Challenge.

16:30.187 --> 16:31.990
Unlike Some People I Know,

16:32.023 --> 16:34.158
Mr. Oops-I-Dropped-The-Ball.

16:34.192 --> 16:36.495
It Was A Bad Throw.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.497
Alex Voice-Over: Do You Know
What They're Talking About?

16:38.529 --> 16:39.663
I Don't.

16:39.697 --> 16:41.232
Every Time My Dad And The Mayor
Get Together,

16:41.265 --> 16:42.833
I Get A Weird Vibe,

16:42.866 --> 16:45.002
Like Something Major
Happened To The Two In The Past.

16:45.035 --> 16:47.004
But You Can't Ask Them
What Happened.

16:47.038 --> 16:48.539
They Never Want
To Talk About It.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.509
Oh, Well, Anyway...

16:50.542 --> 16:51.509
Come On, Todd.

16:51.543 --> 16:52.878
Show Us
What You Got.

17:09.059 --> 17:10.861
[Laughs]

17:10.894 --> 17:13.531
Way To Go, Todd!

17:13.565 --> 17:15.067
Ha Ha Ha.

17:15.098 --> 17:16.867
I Guess
Our Principal

17:16.901 --> 17:18.036
Is Easily
Impressed.

17:18.068 --> 17:19.037
Yeah.

17:19.069 --> 17:22.039
Hey, You Guys Bowl
Strikes Every Time?

17:22.073 --> 17:24.076
No. We're Not That Good.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.710
I Didn't Think So.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.546
10 Frames With All Strikes
Is A Perfect Game.

17:27.578 --> 17:28.712
It's Pretty Rare,

17:28.746 --> 17:30.082
Like Hitting 3 Homers
In A Baseball Game.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.549
That's It?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.451
By The Time We're Done,
I Guarantee You

17:33.484 --> 17:35.419
I'll Have Bowled A 100.

17:35.452 --> 17:38.656
Whoo!

17:35.452 --> 17:38.656
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

17:39.423 --> 17:40.625
Hey, Don't Laugh At Me!

17:40.657 --> 17:42.226
You Know I'm Gonna
Be That Good.

17:42.259 --> 17:45.396
A Perfect Game
Is A 300, Slick, Not 100.

17:45.430 --> 17:46.631
That's Like Hitting A Single.

17:46.663 --> 17:47.731
But You Just Said--

17:47.765 --> 17:48.767
Look, A Strike Scores 10

17:48.799 --> 17:50.067
Plus The Next 2 Balls
You Roll.

17:50.101 --> 17:51.403
So You Could Score
30 Points, See?

17:51.435 --> 17:53.070
Think Baseball.
3 Strikes.

17:53.104 --> 17:54.806
A Spare Is 10 Plus
The Next Ball You Roll.

17:54.838 --> 17:55.973
So If I Said, "Hey,
You Got A Spare Ball..."

17:56.007 --> 17:57.476
Strike 3, Spare 2.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.911
That's How Come 100
Is Nothing Too Special.

17:59.943 --> 18:01.312
Got It?

18:02.646 --> 18:03.748
Whatever.

18:03.780 --> 18:05.783
I Just Need Some Practice.

18:09.019 --> 18:12.290
Well, Things Are Going Well.

18:20.531 --> 18:23.134
He Has No Form,
No Style.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.302
I Think He Was Nervous.
Just Give Him A Chance.

18:25.336 --> 18:28.039
Yeah, Like He'll
Give Us One.

18:29.507 --> 18:30.509
[Door Bell Tinkles]

18:30.541 --> 18:31.609
Hi.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.111
Hey, My Favorite Customers.

18:33.144 --> 18:34.479
Hey, Nancy. Can We
Get The Usual?

18:34.511 --> 18:36.181
I'm Way Ahead Of You.

18:36.213 --> 18:37.615
Come On, Eat Up.

18:37.648 --> 18:39.884
You're Gonna Need Your Strength
To Win The Mighty Apple.

18:41.185 --> 18:43.821
Whoa. I Thought 
The Golden Boy
Only Mattered.

18:44.821 --> 18:46.290
That's What Everybody Else
Is Saying.

18:46.324 --> 18:47.325
Yeah, Some People
Say That.

18:47.357 --> 18:48.993
And Some People Say
The Moon's Made Of Cheese.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.128
It Doesn't Make It True.

18:50.161 --> 18:51.663
The Moon's Not Made
Of Cheese?

18:51.695 --> 18:53.497
Yeah, Well, It Just
Goes To Show You,

18:53.530 --> 18:56.067
You Can Learn Something New
From Everyone.

18:58.502 --> 19:00.838
Hey, Good Afternoon,
Ladies.

19:00.872 --> 19:03.307
Hey, Todd.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.309
Hey, Todd. You Know
That Alex Kid?

19:05.343 --> 19:06.510
What's With Those Clothes?

19:06.544 --> 19:09.480
I Heard He Found Them At
The Back Of A Bowling Alley.

19:09.513 --> 19:10.981
Yeah? Well, I Hear
He's A Great Bowler.

19:11.015 --> 19:12.484
Is That True?

19:12.517 --> 19:13.985
Hey, Bowling Is Not
So Hard, Ok?

19:14.018 --> 19:14.986
Just Leave It Alone.

19:15.019 --> 19:16.988
What Are You Gonna Do?
You Gonna Quit?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.155
Quit? Hah!

19:18.189 --> 19:21.493
No Way. If We Lose This,
Nothing Else Matters.

19:21.526 --> 19:22.693
So I'm Gonna Teach
Those Guys

19:22.727 --> 19:24.329
How To Bowl And Triumph.

19:24.362 --> 19:25.864
But It Will Still
Be Bowling.

19:25.896 --> 19:27.831
Hey, I'm Gonna
Work On That.

19:27.865 --> 19:30.935
I Promise You, I'm Gonna
Win Us The Apple.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.341
So The Mighty Apple's
Fate Is Up To Us.

19:37.375 --> 19:39.344
Hah. You Gotta Admit,
It's Pretty Funny.

19:39.376 --> 19:40.546
No Kidding. 

19:41.613 --> 19:43.248
Maybe This Will Make
People Care For Bowling

19:43.280 --> 19:44.348
Enough To Save
The Alley.

19:44.382 --> 19:45.517
Yeah. I Hope So.

19:45.549 --> 19:48.019
I Mean, Sometimes I Think
The Only Reason Your Dad

29:44.714 --> 29:46.283
Look Like A Bunch
Of Losers, Aren't You?

29:46.317 --> 29:48.786
Uh, No Question.

29:48.818 --> 29:49.787
Ugh!

29:49.819 --> 29:52.289
You're All Right.

29:52.323 --> 29:53.825
Good To Have Bubba
On Your Side.

29:53.857 --> 29:55.192
Oh.

29:55.226 --> 29:56.294
Todd Says
The Mighty Apple

29:56.326 --> 29:57.528
Is Up To
The Two Of You.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.995
If You Both
Do Well,

29:59.028 --> 30:00.298
You're Gonna
Be Heroes.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.500
Todd Would Know.
He Already Is A Hero.

30:02.532 --> 30:04.501
You Want
To Dance, Todd?

30:04.535 --> 30:05.503
I'll Dance.

30:05.536 --> 30:07.172
Nah. Maybe Later.

30:09.506 --> 30:11.175
Do You Want
To Dance, Alex?

30:11.208 --> 30:13.978
Oh, I Don't Really
Know How To Dance To This.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.312
I'll Dance.

30:15.346 --> 30:16.646
Whoa,
Look At The Time.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.149
I--I Gotta Go.

30:18.182 --> 30:20.483
Come On, It's 8:30.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.220
Next Time, Ok?

30:22.252 --> 30:24.154
Thanks For Inviting Me
To Your Party, Lauren.

30:24.188 --> 30:27.158
Friends Of Todd's
Are Always Welcome.

30:27.191 --> 30:28.491
Yeah?

30:28.525 --> 30:30.328
Yeah.

Late Errands And Stuff.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.214
Ok, That's Not
Exactly True.

31:24.248 --> 31:25.216
I Went
To Lauren's Party.

31:25.249 --> 31:27.718
Cheerleader.
Todd's Friend.

31:27.750 --> 31:30.387
[Laughs]
Oh, My Gosh.

31:30.421 --> 31:31.389
Wait A Second.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.623
So You And
The Golden Boy

31:32.655 --> 31:34.291
Were At
The Same Party.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.293
Did You Know

31:35.326 --> 31:36.427
Any Of The Other
People There?

31:36.460 --> 31:37.929
Not Really,

31:37.961 --> 31:40.564
Unless You Count Flip
And Leo As Real People.

31:40.596 --> 31:42.266
I'm Not Gonna
Lose You

31:42.298 --> 31:43.634
To That Whole Crowd,
Am I?

31:43.666 --> 31:46.436
Don't Sweat It.
It Was Just One Party.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.605
Hey, What You Got There?

31:48.638 --> 31:51.641
220? That's Fantastic.

31:51.674 --> 31:52.943
Thanks.
I Was Gonna Pin It

31:52.977 --> 31:53.945
To Your Front Door.

31:53.978 --> 31:55.246
I'm Sorry
I Missed It.

31:55.278 --> 31:56.413
Hey, I Promise
I'll Be There

31:56.446 --> 31:57.414
When You Bowl 300.

31:57.448 --> 31:58.615
Deal.

31:58.648 --> 32:00.984
All Right.

32:26.309 --> 32:29.679
You Got Talent,
But Your Footwork's Terrible.

32:29.712 --> 32:31.281
Like That Matters.

32:31.315 --> 32:32.984
You're Right. I Don't Know
What I'm Saying.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.317
Keep Doing It Your Way.

32:34.351 --> 32:37.154
Well, Actually, If You
Keep Doing It Your Way,

32:37.186 --> 32:40.690
You're Gonna End Up
With Mediocre Scores
And A Bad Bowling Back.

32:40.723 --> 32:41.958
Keep At It, Though.

32:41.991 --> 32:43.626
You're A Natural.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.363
Thanks.

32:50.401 --> 32:52.470
Way To Boost
His Ego, Dad.

32:52.502 --> 32:54.637
I Thought You Were
On My Side.

32:54.671 --> 32:57.540
Alex, I Am
On Your Side.

32:57.574 --> 33:00.344
And Todd's
On Your Side, Too.

33:00.376 --> 33:01.345
You Gotta Remember,

33:01.377 --> 33:03.013
You're Fighting For
The Mighty Apple.

33:07.017 --> 33:08.184
Hello, Dropsy.

33:08.218 --> 33:09.220
Watching Todd
Prepare To Bring

33:09.252 --> 33:10.221
The Apple Back
To West Appleton?

33:10.253 --> 33:11.221
Something
You Certainly

33:11.255 --> 33:12.223
Never
Accomplished.

33:12.256 --> 33:14.992
Right Back At You There,
Error Boy.

33:15.025 --> 33:17.061
Hello, Gang. Todd.

33:18.362 --> 33:20.865
We Just Set The Rules
With The East.

33:20.897 --> 33:23.500
It's A 4-On-4 Match,
One Game Per Person.

33:23.534 --> 33:27.004
Add Up The Score, And The
Highest Total Score Wins.

33:27.037 --> 33:29.539
You Can Also Add
A Substitute Player
On The Bench

33:29.573 --> 33:32.343
For The Current Player
At Any Time.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.676
And Like A Pinch Hitter,

33:33.710 --> 33:35.513
Sub's In For Good.

33:35.546 --> 33:36.547
This Is A Miracle.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.848
I Don't Have To Bowl.

33:38.882 --> 33:40.851
No Way. The Day
Before The Game,
We Should All Bowl.

33:40.884 --> 33:42.420
4 Highest Scores
Get To Play.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.020
Hey, She Doesn't
Want To Bowl.

33:44.054 --> 33:46.257
Uh, For Once,
I Agree With Todd.

33:46.289 --> 33:48.091
Yeah.

33:48.125 --> 33:49.359
Smart Kid.

33:49.393 --> 33:51.929
I Also Spoke With
Mayor Hanburger Of The East,

33:51.961 --> 33:54.198
And We've Made
A New Little Wager.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.865
You're
Betting On Us?

33:55.898 --> 33:59.369
When East Appleton Loses,

33:59.403 --> 34:00.438
They Will Have
To Proclaim It

34:00.471 --> 34:01.538
West Appleton Day

34:01.571 --> 34:04.107
And Hold A Parade
In Our Honor.

34:04.141 --> 34:05.543
And What If We Lose?

34:05.576 --> 34:07.111
What Type
Of Attitude Is That?

34:07.144 --> 34:10.114
Wait, Wait, Wait.
Wait A Minute Here.

34:10.146 --> 34:12.282
Isn't It Enough
Just To Win The Apple?

34:12.315 --> 34:13.917
I Mean, Do We Need
To Put More Pressure

34:13.951 --> 34:15.219
On These Kids?

34:15.251 --> 34:16.554
Look, When You Got
Someone Like Todd

34:16.585 --> 34:17.554
To Lead You
To Victory,

34:17.588 --> 34:19.056
You've Got To Take
Advantage Of It.

34:19.088 --> 34:21.759
It's A Golden
Opportunity.

34:30.800 --> 34:31.902
What Was With
Your Dad, Alex?

34:31.934 --> 34:33.402
He Seemed
Pretty Tense.

34:33.436 --> 34:35.739
I Have No Idea.
Todd?

34:35.771 --> 34:36.739
Who Knows?

34:36.773 --> 34:37.739
Well, I Got
Homework To Do.

34:37.773 --> 34:38.741
What Are You Guys
Gonna Do?

34:38.775 --> 34:39.742
I'm Gonna Go See

34:39.775 --> 34:40.777
East Appleton's
Bowling Team.

34:40.811 --> 34:42.146
Why?
What They Do

34:42.179 --> 34:43.646
Doesn't Affect
What We Do.

34:43.679 --> 34:44.647
There's
No Offense

34:44.681 --> 34:45.815
And Defense
In Bowling.

34:45.849 --> 34:47.952
But Don't You Want To Know
If We Can Beat Them?

34:47.985 --> 34:50.152
What Good Will It Do
To Know In Advance?

34:50.186 --> 34:52.755
Hey, Maybe We Can Relax
Because Maybe They Stink.

34:52.789 --> 34:54.824
East Appleton
Suggested Bowling.

34:54.858 --> 34:56.427
We Know
They Don't Stink.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.463
[Sighs]
Whatever.

34:59.496 --> 35:01.798
Look, I'm Going Home
To Get My Bike.

35:01.831 --> 35:02.799
You Can Join Me,

35:02.833 --> 35:05.635
If You Guys
Want To Be Smart.

35:09.639 --> 35:10.940
See You, Guys.
Hey, Todd, Wait Up.

35:10.974 --> 35:12.210
Alex?

35:15.012 --> 35:17.280
Bye.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.280
What?

35:17.313 --> 35:18.615
Whatever.

35:18.648 --> 35:19.884
What's Up With That?

35:45.909 --> 35:48.378
Oh, Wow.

35:48.411 --> 35:49.980
Look At This Place.

35:50.012 --> 35:52.182
It's Just Bigger,
That's All.

35:52.215 --> 35:54.217
Still,
Pretty Impressive.

35:54.251 --> 35:56.653
Yeah, Well, At Least
The Big Apple Lanes

35:56.686 --> 35:57.889
Have Character.

35:59.856 --> 36:01.659
Character?
If That's What

36:01.692 --> 36:03.094
You Want To Call It.

36:15.871 --> 36:17.507
What?

36:17.541 --> 36:18.676
They've Got
The Nagurski Twins,

36:18.708 --> 36:20.009
Who Whomped
All Over Us In Football,

36:20.043 --> 36:22.846
Baron Mckay, Star
Of The Basketball Team,

36:22.878 --> 36:24.847
And Katie Tanner
From The Tennis Team.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.219
We're In
So Much Trouble.

36:35.224 --> 36:38.027
Oh, Nicely Done.

36:38.061 --> 36:39.896
You're Really
Coming Along.

36:39.929 --> 36:42.699
Some Of Us Still Need
A Little Work.

36:42.733 --> 36:45.402
Whipsaw Mcgraw.

36:45.434 --> 36:46.536
Who's
Whipsaw Mcgraw?

36:46.570 --> 36:49.907
Pba Tour Pro. 2-Time
U.S. Open Champion.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.208
Wait, I Thought
That Was Tennis.

36:52.242 --> 36:54.778
Now Remember--
Consistency Is The Key.

36:54.811 --> 36:57.047
Practice Your Approach
Over And Over,

36:57.079 --> 36:58.548
And You'll Be Ready
For The Big Match.

36:58.581 --> 36:59.882
I Promise You.

36:59.916 --> 37:01.051
Thanks For Coming,
Whipsaw.

37:01.083 --> 37:03.586
Sure Thing, Cousin.
I'm Just Glad

37:03.619 --> 37:05.722
I Had A Few Days Off
From The Tour.

37:05.755 --> 37:07.257
I'll See You Later.

37:08.257 --> 37:10.093
We Don't
Stand A Chance.

37:10.126 --> 37:11.262
They Were All Right.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.097
All Right? They're
Like Machines.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.431
They're Perfect.

37:14.463 --> 37:16.299
Don't Give Up On
The Mighty Apple Just Yet.

37:16.333 --> 37:18.434
They Won't Bowl Strikes
Every Time.

37:18.467 --> 37:20.637
Watch Them With Me.
You'll See.

37:25.809 --> 37:28.312
All Right,
I've Seen Enough.

37:29.478 --> 37:30.947
Suit Yourself.

37:32.983 --> 37:35.251
Well, What Do We
Have Here?

37:35.284 --> 37:37.954
Hi. I Was Just Leaving.

37:37.987 --> 37:39.756
I Don't Like Spies.
You Like Spies, Baron?

37:39.789 --> 37:42.259
Spying? You Didn't
Think I Was--

37:42.291 --> 37:44.627
Hey! There You Are,
You Loser.

37:44.661 --> 37:46.463
Well, Well,
If It Isn't Mclemore.

37:46.496 --> 37:47.798
We Hear You're
Mr. Bowling Now.

37:47.831 --> 37:49.133
I Told You
Not To Come Here.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.634
Where's Your Sense
Of Sportsmanship, Man?

37:50.666 --> 37:53.103
But I Came Here
With You.

37:53.135 --> 37:54.103
Is That A Fact,
Mclemore?

37:54.137 --> 37:55.439
Me? Hang With This Guy?

37:55.472 --> 37:57.341
Guess Again, Boys.

37:57.373 --> 37:58.775
You Gonna
Take Care Of Him?

37:58.809 --> 37:59.777
Well, Don't You
Worry About It.

37:59.809 --> 38:00.777
I'll Make Sure
This Punk

38:00.811 --> 38:02.480
Doesn't Bother
You Again.

38:07.650 --> 38:08.951
What Are You Doing?

38:08.985 --> 38:10.454
This Was All
Your Idea.

38:10.487 --> 38:13.190
[Laughs]
Let's Get Out Of Here.

38:15.157 --> 38:16.659
I Knew What You
Were Doing All Along.

38:16.693 --> 38:17.695
Oh, Yeah, Right.

38:17.728 --> 38:18.695
You're A Horrible
Actor, Then.

38:18.728 --> 38:21.464
Me?
Look Who's Talking.

38:21.498 --> 38:23.166
Unless
You Were Acting
When You Thought

38:23.199 --> 38:24.967
We'd Lose
To The East.

38:25.001 --> 38:26.470
Well, Then,
I Guess You Were
Pretty Good, Too.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.506
Oh, Get Over It.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.643
They Were Pretty Good,
Weren't They?

38:32.675 --> 38:35.211
Look. Meet Me
At The Alley

38:35.244 --> 38:36.480
Tomorrow Morning.

38:36.512 --> 38:39.817
I'll Teach You How
To Bowl With Style.

38:39.849 --> 38:40.983
Then You Won't Be
Too Scared Of Them.

38:41.016 --> 38:42.485
What, Me?

38:42.518 --> 38:43.986
You Were The Scared One.

38:44.019 --> 38:44.987
You Actually Thought

38:45.021 --> 38:46.190
I Was Mad At You,
Didn't You?

38:46.222 --> 38:47.190
No.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.193
Yes, You Did. Admit It.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.179
Hey, Todd.

39:09.211 --> 39:10.347
Man, It's Early.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.347
What Am I Doing Here?

39:11.380 --> 39:12.715
Gotta Move,
Gotta Jive.

39:12.748 --> 39:14.183
What The Heck
Does That Mean?

39:14.217 --> 39:15.352
That's What We're
Doing Today, Todd.

39:15.385 --> 39:17.221
Yep. Time To Get
In The Zone.

39:19.588 --> 39:21.023
Hey.

39:21.056 --> 39:23.226
Delia Isn't Using
Her Lane Today.

39:23.260 --> 39:24.595
Why Don't You
Come Over And Join Us?

39:27.063 --> 39:28.599
All Right,
Let's Get Going.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.599
I Know The Drill.

39:29.632 --> 39:31.367
No, Slick.
You Know Form,

39:31.400 --> 39:32.435
But You
Don't Know Style.

39:32.469 --> 39:33.704
That's What
You're Gonna Learn.

39:33.737 --> 39:35.405

Wait. So Now It's
The Mighty Apple
And The School?

01:02:20.168 --> 01:02:23.404
Look,
Don't Wimp Out On Me,
Guys. We're So Close.

01:02:23.438 --> 01:02:25.273
We're So Good.

01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:29.911
Alex: Oh, That Was It.
That Was The Final Straw.

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:31.247
My Old Friends Hate Me.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.783
 My New Friends Aren't
 My Friends At All.

01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:36.317
All This Just
Isn't Any Fun Anymore.

01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:38.586
Look At This!
They Bet A School On Us,

01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:39.922
And They Give Us
A Piece Of Junk.

01:02:39.954 --> 01:02:41.257
All They Care
About Is Winning.

01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:42.458
They Don't
Understand Bowling,

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:44.259
 And They Don't
 Understand Us.

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.661
Alex, No One
Understands Us.

01:02:45.693 --> 01:02:47.929
This Is Bogus.
I'm So Outta Here.

01:02:47.963 --> 01:02:49.165
What Do You Mean?

01:02:49.197 --> 01:02:51.266
What Do You Think
I Mean? I Quit.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.135
No Way. You Can't Quit.
You Can't Leave Me Now!

01:02:53.168 --> 01:02:54.603
Watch Me.

01:02:54.635 --> 01:02:55.971
Alex,
You Can't Quit Now.

01:02:56.003 --> 01:02:58.807
We're Too Far
Into This Thing.
The Team Needs You!

01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:01.943
We Are Not Having
A Good Day.

01:03:01.976 --> 01:03:02.944
Oh, What A Loser!

01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:05.947
He's Not A Loser.
This Isn't The Real Alex.

01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:07.316
Of Course,
You Must Know That,

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:08.684
Now That You're
His Best Bud.

01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:12.521
[Sighs] At Least
There's Still 4 Of Us.

01:03:12.554 --> 01:03:17.160
4? Me? Bowl?

01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:20.163
Delia.

01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:20.163
Delia.

01:03:18.659 --> 01:03:20.163
Delia.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:23.199
Just Trying
To Lighten The Mood.

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.483
Did You Talk To Him?

01:03:41.516 --> 01:03:43.519
I Tried.
He's Not
Listening.

01:03:44.853 --> 01:03:47.822
So, Uh, Where's
That Thompson Kid?

01:03:47.856 --> 01:03:49.892
Alex Isn't
Feeling Well.

01:03:49.925 --> 01:03:52.228
Well, Son, You're
Still Ready To Lead
The Team To Victory?

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.063
Actually, Sir,
We're Gonna Let Todd
Bowl For All Of Us.

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:57.166
That Way, He Can
Lead And Follow.

01:03:57.199 --> 01:03:59.034
Well, Todd's Been Through
The Fires Before.

01:03:59.067 --> 01:04:01.237
He's A Leader.
Natural-Born.

01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:04.005
He's Kept Us
All Together,
That's For Sure.

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:06.008
Never Steered
Any Of Us Wrong.

01:04:06.041 --> 01:04:08.244
I Rest My Case.

01:04:11.213 --> 01:04:13.015
I'm So Nervous.

01:04:13.047 --> 01:04:14.849
Don't Be.
You're All Good.

01:04:14.882 --> 01:04:16.251
You're All
Really Good.

01:04:16.284 --> 01:04:19.420
But These Uniforms
Are A Fashion Disaster.

01:04:19.454 --> 01:04:22.358
Look, We Have Fun.
We Do The Best We Can.
That's All We Can Do.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.594
Just Doesn't Seem
Like It's Enough.

01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:32.635
Sometimes
It Isn't Enough.

01:04:37.739 --> 01:04:39.742
This Is So
Unlike Alex.

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:43.545
Been So Unlike Himself
For A While Now.
I Miss Him.

01:04:43.577 --> 01:04:45.079
Nancy, I'm Getting
Another Soda.

01:04:45.112 --> 01:04:47.315
Nancy:
Go Right Ahead.

01:04:45.112 --> 01:04:47.315
[Door Chimes]

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:50.419
Can I Join You?

01:04:50.452 --> 01:04:52.255
Where's Your Fan Club?

01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:57.326
I Left Them
At The "Todd Is King"
Rally My Dad Is Hosting.

01:04:58.793 --> 01:05:00.762
Are You Looking
For Sympathy?

01:05:02.664 --> 01:05:04.566
You Don't
Like To Lose,
Do You?

01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:07.336
I Can't Lose.
It's Not Allowed.

01:05:09.003 --> 01:05:13.074
Look, I Just Came Here
'Cause I Wanted To...
You Know.

01:05:13.108 --> 01:05:14.677
No, I Don't Know.

01:05:17.144 --> 01:05:19.949
Elisa, You Can
Bowl The Worst Game
Of Your Life Tomorrow,

01:05:19.981 --> 01:05:23.751
A 5 Maybe, Or A 10,
But At The End Of The Day,

01:05:23.784 --> 01:05:27.956
Your Friends Wouldn't Care,
And That Is Just So Cool.

01:05:27.989 --> 01:05:30.658
I Wanna Win,
You Know.
We All Do.

01:05:30.692 --> 01:05:32.760
It's Nice Having
People Look At Us.

01:05:32.793 --> 01:05:34.963
Actually At Us,
Not Past Us.

01:05:34.996 --> 01:05:37.932
People
Will Always Look At You
After This, Win Or Lose.

01:05:37.965 --> 01:05:40.435
No. People Will
Always Look At You

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:41.603
And Blame Us
For The Loss

01:05:41.635 --> 01:05:44.605
Or Say We Were
Carried By You
To A Win.

01:05:44.639 --> 01:05:46.108
Look, Forget
About The Game.

01:05:46.141 --> 01:05:48.610
What I'm Saying
Is That Eventually
People Will See You

01:05:48.643 --> 01:05:50.846
Because You're There,
And You're Real.

01:05:50.878 --> 01:05:52.114
That's All That Counts.

01:05:52.146 --> 01:05:53.949
Maybe.

01:05:53.981 --> 01:05:56.451
Definitely.
Trust Me On This One.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.454
You Should
Go Talk To Alex.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.789
I Don't Think
He Wants To Talk To Me.

01:06:00.822 --> 01:06:02.657
Well, You Should
Try, Anyway.

01:06:04.992 --> 01:06:06.128
Yeah.

01:06:06.161 --> 01:06:07.896
 Yeah.

01:06:09.197 --> 01:06:11.367
You Know, I Got
Something For You.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.503
But You're Right.
I Should Go Talk
To Alex First.

01:06:21.342 --> 01:06:23.644
Golden Boy Is Human?

01:06:23.677 --> 01:06:25.013
All Right.

01:06:27.048 --> 01:06:29.351
[Doorbell Rings]

01:06:37.025 --> 01:06:38.527
Hey. What Do You Want?

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:42.163
I'm Sorry
Everything Got So
Messed Up, You Know?

01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:44.666
That's
All I Can Say.

01:06:44.699 --> 01:06:48.204
Right.
Probably Wasn't
Even Your Fault.

01:06:49.704 --> 01:06:53.842
You Know,
I Never Thought I'd
Actually Like You.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:56.010
 I Never Thought
 I'd Like Bowling.

01:06:56.043 --> 01:06:58.713
All I Thought About
Was Winning.

01:06:58.746 --> 01:07:01.582
I Always
Wanted To Win, Too.
We All Did, Really.

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:03.184
We Just Didn't Care
The Same Way You Did.

01:07:03.217 --> 01:07:05.920
I Know That Now, Dummy.
That's What I'm Saying.

01:07:05.954 --> 01:07:07.523
You're Not Me. You're
Not The Same As Me.

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.258
No.

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:12.760
You Know What
The Big Difference Is?

01:07:12.793 --> 01:07:14.929
Hair Color?

01:07:14.963 --> 01:07:16.899
[Chuckles] Yeah.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.202
I Played
Every Sport I Can,

01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:22.070
But I'm Not There
Because I Have Fun.

01:07:22.103 --> 01:07:24.205
I'm There Because
That's What I Do,
And I'm Good At It.

01:07:24.239 --> 01:07:27.409
Sure, Sometimes
It's A Blast,

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:30.445
But That's Not
Why I'm There.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.614
Bowling Was Fun.

01:07:32.646 --> 01:07:34.882
Bowling Still Is Fun,
Alex.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:37.052
Tomorrow, Let's Forget
About The Big Stakes.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:38.554
Let's Just
Go Out There And Bowl.

01:07:38.586 --> 01:07:40.889
If We Win, Great,
And If Not, Well,

01:07:40.922 --> 01:07:43.759
 We'll Have Fun,
 And We'll Try.

01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:46.060
But I Want You
There. If I've
Chased You Away,

01:07:46.094 --> 01:07:47.563
I'm Not Gonna
Have Any Fun At All,

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:50.099
And I Really
Want To Have Fun.

01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:52.968
Look.

01:07:58.806 --> 01:08:01.142
It's Yours Whether
Or Not You Play.

01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:02.911
Tex?

01:08:02.943 --> 01:08:05.014
You Look Like A Tex.

01:08:05.813 --> 01:08:08.250
It's Our
New Uniforms,

01:08:08.282 --> 01:08:09.650
And I Think
I'm Gonna Be Dirk.

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.452
[Laughs]

01:08:11.485 --> 01:08:12.653
Just Promise Me
Something.

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.956
Next Time You Bowl,
Whenever It Is,

01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:16.492
Just Have Fun Again.

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:20.328
Good Night, Dirk.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.296
Good Night, Tex!

01:08:33.307 --> 01:08:34.975
Hey.

01:08:36.211 --> 01:08:37.613
Thought I Heard Voices.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:39.715
Nah. It's Just Me.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:44.286
Just Got Off
The Phone With Mom.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.321
She And Grandpa
Are Coming Back
Tomorrow Night.

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:49.992
They Said They Miss You.

01:08:51.326 --> 01:08:56.198
And I Miss Bowling. You Know,
The Way It Used To Be.

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.968
You Know,
Jeff Mclemore And I

01:09:00.001 --> 01:09:03.203
Used To Play
Second Base And Shortstop
On The School Baseball Team.

01:09:03.238 --> 01:09:06.875
Bottom Of The Ninth
Against East Appleton,

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:08.844
We Mess Up A Double Play.

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:11.145
He Says That
I Dropped The Ball,

01:09:11.179 --> 01:09:13.881
And I Say That
He Made A Bad Throw,

01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:16.051
But We Lost The Game.

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:18.487
Later On In The Year,
We Lose The Apple.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.225
And We Decided
It Was Because Of
That Missed Double Play.

01:09:23.256 --> 01:09:26.327
It Became A Huge Thing
Between Us.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:28.564
We Stopped
Having Fun Together,

01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:32.233
And We Stopped
Being Friends.

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:36.069
We Claimed That
The Mighty Apple
Changed Us.

01:09:36.104 --> 01:09:38.673
Of Course, It Wasn't
Really The Apple.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.377
It Was Just Us.

01:09:42.577 --> 01:09:44.578
Letting That Happen
Was The Stupidest Thing

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.948
Either One Of Us
Has Ever Done.

01:09:52.953 --> 01:09:55.123
You Lock Up
When You Come In?

01:09:56.091 --> 01:09:58.026
Yeah? Ok.

01:09:58.059 --> 01:10:00.396
Good Night.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:13.409
[Cheering]

01:10:17.578 --> 01:10:20.081
Let's Go, Guys!

01:10:33.927 --> 01:10:35.596
Surprise. We're Back.

01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:37.099
Hey.

01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:39.768
Oh, My Gosh.
It's Good To See You.

01:10:39.801 --> 01:10:41.436
Hiya, Grandpa.
How Ya Feeling?

01:10:41.469 --> 01:10:42.436
Great.

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.438
Look At This Place.

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:45.439
He's Coming.

01:10:45.472 --> 01:10:47.643
Elisa,
He's Not Coming.

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.077
Yes, He's Coming.

01:10:49.109 --> 01:10:51.512
Well, He Better Hurry.

01:10:52.479 --> 01:10:56.651
Oh, Hanburger.
The School Is Ours.

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:58.320
Heh Heh. You Dream.

01:10:58.353 --> 01:11:01.289
The Apple And The School
Belong To The East.

01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:03.826
We'll See.

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.097
Thank You, Thank You.

01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:12.100
Welcome To
The Big Apple Lanes,

01:11:12.132 --> 01:11:14.636
The Pride
Of West Appleton.

01:11:17.872 --> 01:11:20.442
Now, On Behalf
Of My Colleague,
Mayor Hanburger,

01:11:20.475 --> 01:11:22.778
We Welcome You
To The Last Event

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:26.347
In The History
Of The Mighty Apple.

01:11:26.381 --> 01:11:29.318
Winner Take All.

01:11:34.689 --> 01:11:36.792
Man, There's A Lot
Of People In There.

01:11:36.824 --> 01:11:39.161
Ain't It Great?

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:40.796
And Now, For
The Last Time Ever,

01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:41.962
Mayor Hanburger And I

01:11:41.996 --> 01:11:44.833
Will Unveil
The Mighty Apple.

01:12:01.181 --> 01:12:07.355
It's A Beauty, And Tonight,
We'll Know Where It Resides
For All Eternity.

01:12:10.725 --> 01:12:12.494
We Certainly Will.

01:12:12.527 --> 01:12:14.829
And Now, Without
Any Further Ado,

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.332
Let's Bring Out
Our Teams.

01:12:17.364 --> 01:12:19.166
Representing East Appleton,

01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:23.204
Our Pride And Joy--
The Bowling Wolfpack!

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.210
[Booing]

01:12:37.418 --> 01:12:39.587
Booing In A Bowling Alley?

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:41.056
Look At All Those Cameras.

01:12:41.088 --> 01:12:43.557
Why Would Anyone Wanna
Take A Picture Of This?

01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:46.261
Because Our Uniforms
Are So Darn Cool.

01:12:46.293 --> 01:12:48.262
[Shrieking]

01:12:48.296 --> 01:12:50.766
I'm Sorry.
Let's Have Some Fun.

01:12:50.798 --> 01:12:52.400
[Yells]

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:53.435
Whoo!

01:12:53.467 --> 01:12:55.237
All Right.

01:12:53.467 --> 01:12:55.237
Yeah.

01:12:56.904 --> 01:12:59.106
And Here Comes
The Pride Of The West,

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.610
Today Sporting The Name
The Alley Cats.

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:03.078
Spunky, Yes?

01:13:06.247 --> 01:13:07.883
There's Todd Mclemore,

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:10.652
Looking Confident,
As One Would Expect.

01:13:21.829 --> 01:13:24.399
For Those Of You
Listening At Home,

01:13:24.431 --> 01:13:25.634
Let Me Tell You
What The Rules Are.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:26.802
They're Simple.

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.904
Each Squad Starts
With 4 Bowlers.

01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:30.939
At Any Point In Time
In A Bowler's Game,

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:33.274
A Substitution
Can Be Made,

01:13:33.307 --> 01:13:35.778
And That Bowler
Finishes The Game.

01:13:36.778 --> 01:13:38.413
You're Going Down.

01:13:38.445 --> 01:13:41.149
It's Bowling, Slick.
Mellow Out.

01:13:41.181 --> 01:13:44.618
Mellow Out? The Attitude
Of A True Loser.

01:13:44.652 --> 01:13:47.322
I Don't Think We're Gonna
Be Seeing Much In The Way
Of Substitutions,

01:13:47.354 --> 01:13:50.458
Even Though Both Teams
Have A Sub On The Bench.

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:52.994
But There Is Always
That Chance.

01:13:53.027 --> 01:13:57.765
Anyways, You Add Up
The Total Of The 4 Games,
And That's Your Total.

01:13:57.798 --> 01:13:59.967
The Team With
The Highest Total Wins.

01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:01.269
It's Simple.

01:14:01.301 --> 01:14:05.272
Not Really Head To Head,
But Still Head To Head.

01:14:05.305 --> 01:14:10.611
Oh, My. No One Told Me
That Bowling Could Be
So Exciting.

01:14:10.645 --> 01:14:12.013
[Blows]

01:14:12.046 --> 01:14:13.782
Here Comes The Coin Toss.

01:14:13.814 --> 01:14:15.483
Heads.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.119
We'll Go Second.

01:14:19.153 --> 01:14:21.690
East Appleton Is Gonna
Get The Game Going.

01:14:21.722 --> 01:14:24.458
Our Gang From The West Is
Gonna Start With Ken Long,

01:14:24.492 --> 01:14:27.462
Followed By Elisa Bowers,
Alex Thompson,

01:14:27.494 --> 01:14:30.364
And Batting Cleanup,
For Wont Of A Better Term,

01:14:30.398 --> 01:14:31.867
Todd Mclemore.

01:14:31.899 --> 01:14:37.805
Oh, My, The Tension's So High,
I Can Feel My Spleen Pounding.

01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:42.077
Bobby Nagurski,
Star Of The East,
Is Preparing To Bowl.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.823
It's A Tie Game.

01:14:54.855 --> 01:14:57.826
That's My Boy. Whoo!
That's My Boy.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:59.394
Go, Ken Baby.

01:14:59.426 --> 01:15:02.329
Oh, My,
Ladies And Gentlemen,

01:15:02.363 --> 01:15:03.999
It's Clear Already--

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:08.203
This Is Going To Be
One Fine Bowling Match.

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:45.307
After Bowling 3 Frames Each,
We Have A Tie Ball Game.

01:16:16.003 --> 01:16:18.739
Here We Are At
The Seventh-Frame Stretch,

01:16:18.773 --> 01:16:20.809
And East Appleton
Is Leading By 15.

01:16:20.841 --> 01:16:24.478
This Game Is Closer Than
My Shave This Morning.

01:16:35.856 --> 01:16:38.126
Whoa-Ho-Ho.

01:16:38.158 --> 01:16:40.127
I Am Breathless,
My Friends.

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:42.297
Entering Into
The Tenth Frame,

01:16:42.329 --> 01:16:43.931
And East Appleton Leads.

01:16:43.965 --> 01:16:46.266
But The West Is Working On
More Marks.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.136
They Could Catch Up,

01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:51.805
And Dare I Even Dream It,
Win The Mighty Apple!

01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:54.109
Ok, If I Get 3 Strikes,
We Tie.

01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:55.609
Baron Isn't
Working On A Mark,

01:16:55.643 --> 01:16:57.112
So The Highest He Could Get
Is 30 Points.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:59.114
Todd, You're Working On
A Strike.

01:16:59.146 --> 01:17:00.448
You Can Top 30
In A Heartbeat.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.983
All You Need Is
A Strike Or A Spare--

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:04.118
Not A Problem.

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:04.118
Exactly.

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.185
3 Strikes, Al?

01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:07.288
So Not A Problem.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.489
Right.

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:09.658
All Right, Tex,
Go Get 'Em.

01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:10.992
Come On, Alex. Whoo!

01:17:11.024 --> 01:17:13.661
Man: All Right, Wildcats.

01:17:22.703 --> 01:17:24.139
Sweet Lou: Strike One!

01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:27.474
Ho Ho. I Am
Sweating Bullets, Folks.

01:17:27.507 --> 01:17:30.644
So If I Short Out,
It's Been Good Knowing You.

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:33.814
Should I, You Know, Curve One In
Or Put One Right Up The Middle?

01:17:33.847 --> 01:17:34.983
I Think You Should Not
Mess Around.

01:17:35.015 --> 01:17:37.317
Come On. How About One
Between My Legs?

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:39.487
Alex, There's Fun,
And Then There's Torture.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.889
Go Bowl.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.889
Yeah, Go, Go.

01:17:40.921 --> 01:17:43.891
Come On, Alex.
Come On, Alex.

01:17:51.032 --> 01:17:52.167
Yes!

01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:54.068
All Right!

01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:56.070
And The West
Is Still Alive.

01:17:56.104 --> 01:17:59.173
If He Can't Do It,
No One Can. Go, Alex!

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:00.508
[Screaming]

01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:02.844
Oh, This Is Not
A Bad Way To Live.

01:18:02.877 --> 01:18:04.245
All Right.

01:18:04.278 --> 01:18:05.579
Go, Kid.

01:18:05.613 --> 01:18:10.886
Last Ball. Frame 10.
Alex Thompson.

01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:30.604
Strike 3!
Strike 3!

01:18:30.637 --> 01:18:32.740
Oh, My Goodness!

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:38.246
East's Last Bowler Needs
3 Strikes To Keep The Lead.

01:18:46.787 --> 01:18:50.591
East Appleton Leads By 9 Pins.

01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:51.926
Todd Mclemore,
The West's Last Bowler,

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:55.095
Only Needs A Spare To Win
The Mighty Apple.

01:18:55.128 --> 01:18:58.065
Who Else Would You Rather Have
In This Situation?

01:18:58.099 --> 01:19:00.435
I Know This Is
The Wrong Time
To Say This,

01:19:00.467 --> 01:19:01.903
But I Shouldn't Have
Gone Last.

01:19:01.935 --> 01:19:03.904
It's All Right.
Todd, Man, You Can Do It.

01:19:03.938 --> 01:19:05.105
It's Child's Play, Man.

01:19:05.139 --> 01:19:06.608
Spare, And That's It.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:10.578
Todd Mclemore Needs
At Least A Spare

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:13.280
To Give West Appleton
The Victory.

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:26.628
Oh, Bummer For The West.

01:19:26.661 --> 01:19:30.631
Todd Mclemore Launches
A Perfect Ball, But Is Denied.

01:19:30.664 --> 01:19:32.432
Now He Has A 7-10 Split.

01:19:32.466 --> 01:19:34.302
And He Has To Make
This Spare,

01:19:34.335 --> 01:19:36.503
Or The Apple Goes Home
With The Dreaded Wolfpack.

01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:39.274
I Think I'm Having
Liver Failure.

01:19:39.306 --> 01:19:41.509
It Was A Perfect Ball.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:44.112
You Bowled The
Best Game Of Your Life
Under This Pressure, Todd.

01:19:44.145 --> 01:19:46.514
I Can't Make This Shot,
And We're Gonna Lose.

01:19:46.546 --> 01:19:47.815
No, We're Not.

01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:51.286
I Can Make The Shot.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.954
You Can Make The Shot?

01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:54.622
Yep.

01:19:54.654 --> 01:19:56.990
Todd, They Want You.

01:19:57.024 --> 01:19:58.626
You Can Make The Shot?

01:19:58.658 --> 01:20:00.460
Oh, Yeah.

01:20:00.493 --> 01:20:01.795
[Crowd Chants Todd]

01:20:01.828 --> 01:20:05.500
Then We're Gonna Take
That Substitution.
Referee.

01:20:05.533 --> 01:20:09.637
Leap Out Of Your Chairs, Folks.
We Are Seeing History.

01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:13.173
Todd Mclemore Has
Removed Himself From This Game.

01:20:13.207 --> 01:20:15.210
[Groans]

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:17.811
What Are You Doing, Todd?

01:20:17.845 --> 01:20:19.146
It's Ok, Dad.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.648
You Get Back In There.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.049
No, Dad.

01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:23.518
I'm Ordering You, Son.

01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:25.153
You're Our Best Hope To Win.

01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:28.389
Why? Because You Want Me To Be?
It Doesn't Work That Way, Dad.

01:20:28.421 --> 01:20:32.259
Sometimes I'm Not The Best,
And You Gotta Let That Be Ok.

01:20:34.028 --> 01:20:36.865
Now Why Don't You
Go Back Over There And
Cheer For Our Team, Dad?

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:38.699
Not Just For Me.

01:20:46.873 --> 01:20:49.077
Come On, Delia.
You've Got This Cold.

01:20:49.109 --> 01:20:50.677
Come On, Del.

01:20:50.711 --> 01:20:52.713
Come On, Let's Go.

01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:30.885
It's Moving.

01:21:30.917 --> 01:21:34.622
Have Mercy. That Ball Is Moving.

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:44.399
I Am Having
An Apoplexy Here, Folks.

01:21:44.431 --> 01:21:46.067
If There's A Doctor
Out There Listening,

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.468
Come On Down Here And Help Me.

01:21:47.501 --> 01:21:50.971
You'll Be Here Before
The Ball Hits The Pins!

01:22:10.824 --> 01:22:13.827
You Have Done This Before,
Haven't You?

01:22:14.627 --> 01:22:17.197
Wouldn't You Like To Know?

01:22:40.654 --> 01:22:43.158
Almost There.

01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:46.493
Hold Everything.

01:22:46.527 --> 01:22:49.463
Now Remember--
I'm The One Who Cares
About The Fun Of Bowling.

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.798
I'm Not Into Competition.

01:22:51.832 --> 01:22:54.469
But Did I Care If Delia
Made That Spare,

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:57.138
Thereby Winning The Mighty Apple
For West Appleton?

01:22:57.171 --> 01:22:59.307
Did I Care?

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.476
Did I Ever!

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:04.412
Well, What Do You Know?

01:23:10.184 --> 01:23:11.819
Spare!

01:23:11.851 --> 01:23:13.720
Spare!

01:23:13.753 --> 01:23:17.524
A Spare!
West Appleton Wins!

01:23:17.557 --> 01:23:19.394
Whoo!

01:23:25.032 --> 01:23:29.002
You Were Right, Dad.
Bowling Isn't Just For Fun.
Thank You.

01:23:29.036 --> 01:23:31.405
No. Thank You
For Everything.
You Were Great.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:33.541
I Love Ya, Alex.

01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:35.275
I Love You, Too, Mom.

01:23:37.377 --> 01:23:38.378
You Did It.
You Did It.

01:23:38.412 --> 01:23:39.881
We Did It, Dad.

01:23:39.913 --> 01:23:41.681
[Grunts] Ahem.

01:23:41.715 --> 01:23:44.252
Listen, I'm Sorry.

01:23:44.284 --> 01:23:46.854
Always Thought You Liked
All The Attention.

01:23:46.886 --> 01:23:48.889
I Forgot About
All The Pressure.

01:23:48.922 --> 01:23:51.559
You Know What I Learned, Dad?
I Learned Sports Can Be Fun,

01:23:51.591 --> 01:23:53.527
Not Just An Intense
"Gotta Win" Game.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.563
I Still Want To Win,
But I Really Like This
Having Fun Business.

01:23:56.596 --> 01:23:58.365
I Know. I'm Sorry.

01:23:58.399 --> 01:24:00.101
It Should Always Be Fun.

01:24:00.134 --> 01:24:01.601
It's Just That
You're So Special,

01:24:01.635 --> 01:24:04.539
I Want The Best
For You So Badly.
I'm So Proud Of You.

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.074
Thanks, Dad.

01:24:06.106 --> 01:24:07.574
I'm Proud Of All Of You.

01:24:07.608 --> 01:24:08.576
[Cheering]

01:24:08.609 --> 01:24:11.879
The Apple's Ours.
The School Is Ours.

01:24:11.912 --> 01:24:14.414
 The West Lives On.

01:24:14.448 --> 01:24:17.218
Hey, Dad, It's Not About Ego.
You Didn't Play, We Did,

01:24:17.251 --> 01:24:18.920
So We Should Get
To Decide What's What.

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:23.091
You Don't
Want The School To Be
West Appleton Junior High?

01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:25.059
You Really Think Someone
Should Lose Their Identity

01:24:25.091 --> 01:24:27.761
Over Something As Fun
As Bowling? I Don't.

01:24:27.795 --> 01:24:29.998
Well, Mayor...

01:24:31.832 --> 01:24:33.101
You Won.

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:36.337
No, Uh, The Team Won.

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:40.908
Same Thing.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:45.947
And, Um, Well, We're Not
Gonna Name The School.

01:24:45.979 --> 01:24:47.080
You're Not?

01:24:47.113 --> 01:24:49.250
Yes, We Are.

01:24:49.283 --> 01:24:51.119
You Are?

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:55.523
Yeah. We're Gonna Name It
Appleton Central.

01:24:56.489 --> 01:24:59.126
I Love It.

01:24:59.159 --> 01:25:00.461
Yeah, I Like It.

01:25:00.493 --> 01:25:01.795
It Rocks.

01:25:02.863 --> 01:25:04.332
Yes.

01:25:04.364 --> 01:25:05.932
Hey, You Know What
This Place Needs?

01:25:05.966 --> 01:25:06.934
A Little Fun.

01:25:06.966 --> 01:25:08.235
A Little Music.
