00:28.362 --> 00:29.363
Is it bad?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.073
Is it bad?

00:32.156 --> 00:33.158
Nah.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.710
Stop the car.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.467
Stop the car!

00:53.220 --> 00:54.263
What are you doing?

00:54.847 --> 00:57.140
-Get away! Close the door!
-No! Let me go!

00:57.224 --> 00:59.351
-Get the door! Natalie! Hold on!
-Stop the car!

00:59.434 --> 01:02.020
-Get her back in.
-Close the fucking door!

01:04.690 --> 01:06.024
Get her back in.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.778
Now!

01:13.198 --> 01:15.576
-Please, we have to go back.
-Strap her in.

01:15.659 --> 01:19.454
Please. We have to turn around.
We can't leave her there. Stop the car!

01:19.538 --> 01:21.373
What are you doing? That was mad.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.792
You're okay, just breathe. Just breathe.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.627
-We're gonna get help now.
-Fuck's sake.

01:25.711 --> 01:26.879
Aren't we?

01:27.379 --> 01:28.714
I am help.

01:30.174 --> 01:31.216
Where are we going?

01:34.052 --> 01:35.971
You could drive a bit faster.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.016
I could if I wanted to attract attention.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.769
Yeah, but we need attention, don't we?
Someone tried to kill us. He's been shot.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.605
-People are dead.
-We need to call the police.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.107
You sure that wasn't
who we just left behind?

01:52.779 --> 01:53.989
There's no going back.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.223
Wait. What's happening?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.699
-Follow me.
-Where the fuck are we?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.035
Dude.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.923
Nice and quiet, all right?

03:52.774 --> 03:55.986
Geez. Sorry. Sorry.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.003
You okay?

04:13.962 --> 04:14.963
Yeah.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.324
Turn it off.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.789
Find some candles.
I'll check the rest of the place.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.559
Let's go.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.186
Now. Before he comes back.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.655
Shouldn't we wait to see
what he's got to say?

05:22.614 --> 05:24.032
You've been shot, Eddie.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.367
Yeah. I'm okay.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.078
But he's not. He's a psycho.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.539
This is the only way we get answers.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.251
Come on, give me the keys.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.479
Hey, do you think he knows
what this is all about?

07:19.481 --> 07:20.691
Was he dead?

07:23.318 --> 07:24.486
Who?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.781
The man I shot. Was he dead?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.325
I don't know. It was dark.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.910
That shot would've killed a zombie.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.371
Dude.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.874
But it was an accident, right? Soâ€¦

07:40.711 --> 07:45.841
Anyone find anything with a name
or password on? Bills, receipts, notes?

07:45.924 --> 07:47.009
What are you looking for?

07:47.092 --> 07:50.220
Can you please fill in a few gaps for us?
We're a tiny bit freaked out about--

07:50.304 --> 07:51.388
Everything.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.764
Everything. Thanks.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.392
-How did you find us?
-And why?

07:57.603 --> 07:58.979
Someone tried to kill me.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.608
It makes sense it was
whoever's trying to make it look like

08:02.691 --> 08:03.984
I kidnapped Leo Newman.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.569
You mean, you didn't kidnap him?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.989
I went to find out what she knows.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.076
Saw them get lifted, then I followed.

08:14.536 --> 08:15.621
Well, thank God you did.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.456
I don't think he did it
out of the kindness of his heart.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.499
I did it because you're my best chance

08:19.583 --> 08:23.504
of finding out what the fuck is going on
and why we've been lumped together.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.796
It's your fault.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.010
You're the one who's been texting me.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.179
You were on the motorbike.
This is all you.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.431
You two know each other?

08:34.515 --> 08:35.515
What motorbike?

08:36.265 --> 08:37.893
You shot me yesterday.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.437
I knew if you'd gone to the police
they'd put you in a vest.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.815
I didn't go to the police.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.528
If I'd wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.824
What the hell is going on here?

09:04.127 --> 09:05.379
Who are you?

09:05.462 --> 09:08.340
You know who he is.
The police told us. He's a trained killer.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.883
But I'm not your enemy.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.345
We're the only people that any of us
can trust even a little bit right now.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.807
And we have a couple of hours, tops,
to share what we know.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.643
Whoever sent those guys
already know it's gone bad.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.727
So, who were they?

09:20.811 --> 09:22.938
-Black ops, ex-military.
-How can you be sure?

09:23.021 --> 09:24.147
How do you think?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.194
-Sent by who?
-British authorities, FBI.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.196
Are you really saying
I shot a police officer?

09:31.280 --> 09:33.448
Well, you killed
our best chance of finding out.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.744
So, you think he's definitely dead?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.165
Seriously?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.463
The good news is that
officially it didn't happen.

09:48.547 --> 09:52.426
That scene will be clear by now.
Maybe apart from her sister's body.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.594
Natalie? Natalie!

09:54.803 --> 09:56.138
Natalie!

10:02.519 --> 10:06.148
-No. Get off. Get off me.
-Hey. Stop.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.608
No, I won't leave her there.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.985
They can't get away with this.
It did happen.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.739
Stop.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.873
Anybody else got a phone?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.709
No, they've already taken them off us.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.048
Listen, we're all in this togeth--

10:32.216 --> 10:34.426
She's gone. Do you hear? Gone.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.935
Now, do you want to find out
who did it or not?

10:52.110 --> 10:54.196
So, why us?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.740
Don't get too comfortable.
We haven't got long.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.368
Come on. What do we have in common?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.415
We're all British
and we were all in New York

11:05.499 --> 11:06.959
on the day Leo Newman was kidnapped.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.670
Why were you there?

11:10.671 --> 11:11.797
We've been through this.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.757
For the police, I know.

11:13.841 --> 11:17.010
But this time you can tell the truth.
We all can.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.139
What's said here goes no further.
Are we agreed?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.400
I spoke
at a Cooper Newman Foundation event.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.693
I didn't want to, but I--

11:32.776 --> 11:34.152
Why not?

11:35.654 --> 11:38.490
Four years ago, I questioned
whether Leo Newman should be offered

11:38.574 --> 11:39.616
a place at the university

11:39.700 --> 11:42.244
and the ethics of taking money
from his mother's company.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.538
There was a full investigation.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.748
Everything was found to be aboveboard,
and that was it.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.917
Did you talk to him while he was there?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.753
-No.
-Really?

11:52.421 --> 11:56.008
Yes, really. And this does feel
quite like the police interview, actually.

11:56.091 --> 11:57.634
But you must know him?

11:59.803 --> 12:00.804
Why must I?

12:01.889 --> 12:04.016
Because they're saying
he's a student at Oxford.

12:04.725 --> 12:09.813
Have you ever been to a university?
No, of course. Well, they're big places.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.106
Yeah, with lots of windows. I know.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.859
Uh-huh, and there are
more than 20,000 students at Oxford,

12:13.942 --> 12:14.943
and I'm one of them.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.613
No, more to the point, I'm no one.
That's why this is so mad.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.323
He's a carpet salesman.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.532
No, I'm not.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.576
Quite a coincidence though.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.244
Do we look like kidnappers to you?

12:24.328 --> 12:25.704
What does a kidnapper look like?

12:25.787 --> 12:26.788
You.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.629
You looked more like Lara Croft
than a professor back there.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.796
I'm not a professor.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.256
And I'm not a carpet salesman.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.508
So what are you then?

12:38.175 --> 12:39.718
Yeah, why were you in New York?

12:39.801 --> 12:43.263
I went to meet Cooper Newman PR
about a job. Cybersecurity.

12:43.347 --> 12:46.558
I've got a business.
I'm starting it, soon.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.809
Wait--

12:47.893 --> 12:51.104
A multinational corporation
turning over a billion dollars a year

12:51.188 --> 12:52.397
needs to upgrade security,

12:52.481 --> 12:55.901
so they call
for a West London carpet salesman?

12:55.984 --> 12:58.529
-I'm not a--
-Telling the truth, are you?

12:59.821 --> 13:01.907
Do you all understand how deep you're in?

13:02.741 --> 13:04.618
This isn't just about the Newman kid now.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.370
Who do you think
they'll blame her sister on?

13:09.414 --> 13:11.458
-No.
-Fuck, yeah.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.377
Sorry, why should we believe you?

13:15.003 --> 13:17.548
Tell us what you know.
It's your face all over the news.

13:17.631 --> 13:22.302
And whereas your face
isn't anywhere, student. Why's that?

13:22.386 --> 13:25.556
'Cause I was arrested later,
and I wasn't staying in the hotel.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.643
And my face is all over
the front of every fucking newspaper.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.727
Pixilated.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.606
I don't know. Maybe I did see Leo at uni.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.942
Might've spoken to him. I speak to anyone.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.111
Police might have found out

13:39.194 --> 13:41.280
that we were at the same lecture
or at the same pub once,

13:41.363 --> 13:44.283
and then I happened to be in New York
on the day he's kidnapped.

13:44.366 --> 13:47.536
And suddenly, I'm Baby Driver.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.871
Where you from?

13:48.954 --> 13:50.163
Wales, originally.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.168
-Which part?
-Cardiff.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.338
Your parents married there?

13:58.422 --> 13:59.631
-What?
-Answer.

13:59.715 --> 14:03.260
Enough. Your turn.
Your turn to answer to us. To me.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.928
You've been blackmailing me for two years.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.264
Not me, Natalie.

14:08.056 --> 14:12.186
I know you're angry,
but I was just the collector.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.813
The way I heard it, you stole that money
in the first place. Soâ€¦

14:14.897 --> 14:16.899
Yes, and I paid it back.

14:16.982 --> 14:19.776
But those last two cash drops were
for you, weren't they?

14:19.860 --> 14:22.529
That's the reason
I was in New York, isn't it?

14:22.613 --> 14:23.947
Why didn't you pick up?

14:24.031 --> 14:26.074
Who first contacted you
about the New York drop?

14:26.158 --> 14:28.619
You did. Tell the truth.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.664
The police said that
the company I defrauded are owned by CNPR.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.501
Did you know that? Did they send you?

14:36.168 --> 14:37.794
Honestly, I don't know.

14:39.213 --> 14:42.424
It's in nobody's interest for me to have
too much information, you know?

14:54.937 --> 14:56.396
Who do you work for?

14:56.480 --> 14:58.815
I don't work for anybody,
as discussed. I'm a student.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.359
-Studying what?
-History.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.527
All of it?

15:01.610 --> 15:03.737
-What?
-Which period? Answer.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.906
-Ancient. What is this?
-Ancient British or what?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.157
Oh, fuck you.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.283
Eddie!

15:08.367 --> 15:09.868
Eddie, are you all right?

15:11.245 --> 15:13.539
Hey. Hey, you okay, mate?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.542
Someone find him a clean shirt.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.934
You can see the road from upstairs.
Will you keep an eye out?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.273
Go watch the front of the house.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.484
I'll deal with him.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.030
Oh, shit.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.119
Uh-oh. You're lucky, student.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.583
You're gonna have a proper scar
from this, if you live.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.046
Joke.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.176
Come on, come on. Oh, fuck.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.314
How is he?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.859
Bullet only winged him.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.278
-Didn't hurt anything vital.
-How can you tell?

17:49.361 --> 17:50.612
Fact he's breathing.

17:50.696 --> 17:51.697
Here.

17:52.406 --> 17:53.782
Take that out. Cut a square.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.540
Did you learn all this in the army?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.173
Is that where you first killed someone?

18:11.717 --> 18:13.010
Give me that.

18:14.553 --> 18:15.888
How'd it feel?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.182
The first time.

18:23.562 --> 18:25.689
That might be
the first time you've hit a human,

18:25.772 --> 18:27.691
but it's not the first time
you fired a gun.

18:28.901 --> 18:32.154
Well, you don't grow up on a farm
without knowing how to handle a rifle.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.530
Rifle's not a handgun.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.366
My grandfather collected handguns.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.453
One more.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.046
Right. Help me sit him up.

18:50.464 --> 18:51.548
Okay. Okay.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.594
Okay.

18:55.677 --> 18:56.803
Well, don't worry, it gets easier.

18:59.223 --> 19:00.349
You mean to live with?

19:00.432 --> 19:02.309
No, I mean killing people.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.478
The more you do it, the easier it gets.

19:07.064 --> 19:10.275
Here, drink this.
It's got salt and sugar in it.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.612
Fuck.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.577
Come on.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.506
Shit!

20:14.298 --> 20:16.884
-Good looking out.
-Sam?

20:17.885 --> 20:19.094
Is that you?

20:21.930 --> 20:23.348
I can't see the car.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.940
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:32.024 --> 20:35.360
There's no need for that, all right?
Just-- Let's be quiet and he'll leave.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.654
I thought you were away for a while.

20:58.509 --> 21:00.052
Take your shirt off.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.136
Sam?

21:01.845 --> 21:03.096
Are you home?

21:05.933 --> 21:06.934
Are you there?

21:08.894 --> 21:09.895
Sam?

21:13.065 --> 21:14.066
Geez.

21:15.526 --> 21:16.693
Who are you?

21:16.777 --> 21:20.822
Who are you?
And why are you pointing a gun at me?

21:20.906 --> 21:23.575
Well, I live next door. And I saw a light.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.077
Shit.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.210
Sorry, are you--

21:33.293 --> 21:34.753
David.

21:34.837 --> 21:37.673
David. Right. Okay. I think--

21:38.507 --> 21:40.259
Yeah, I think Uncle Sammy
told me about you.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.303
-Uncle?
-It's a term of endearment.

21:43.387 --> 21:45.097
We met while I was traveling.

21:46.557 --> 21:49.309
Are you the NGO friend of his daughter's?

21:49.393 --> 21:50.978
Married to the journalist?

21:51.061 --> 21:54.606
I've been away a while.
Is everyone armed here now?

21:54.690 --> 21:55.691
Sorry about that.

21:55.774 --> 21:58.402
No, I'm sorry for waking you.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.032
Is your husband with you?

22:06.702 --> 22:10.664
Did you not meet him?
When he was last over?

22:11.415 --> 22:12.416
No.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.627
I thought Sammy said thatâ€¦

22:17.254 --> 22:18.463
Baby?

22:29.183 --> 22:30.184
Yep?

22:31.018 --> 22:33.812
Sweetheart, this is David from next door.

22:33.896 --> 22:34.897
Hi, David.

22:36.148 --> 22:38.525
Good job on the neighborhood watch front.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.236
You must be Harry? A pleasure.

22:42.154 --> 22:45.240
Maybe we did meet.
You look familiar now I see you close up.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.159
I'd remember.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.912
I've read your book, you know.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.790
Did you? Well, I hope you bought it
rather than borrowed it.

22:53.874 --> 22:55.417
What did you think?

22:55.501 --> 22:57.044
Well, I was crying, of course.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.587
Me too. So sad.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.255
With laughter.

23:01.465 --> 23:03.717
-I mean, talk about light and shade.
-She's lying.

23:06.261 --> 23:07.596
She never reads my work.

23:08.222 --> 23:10.891
She thinks I don't know,
but the truth is I don't mind.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.019
I love her for other reasons.

23:14.102 --> 23:18.106
Well, I must--
Should be letting you two get someâ€¦

23:19.775 --> 23:21.151
You've got something on yourâ€¦

23:22.069 --> 23:23.403
Thanks.

23:24.905 --> 23:26.990
How long will you be staying for?

23:28.325 --> 23:30.369
We're gonna play it by ear.

23:31.537 --> 23:32.538
Right.

23:35.707 --> 23:36.917
Come on, Delta.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.419
Thanks, then. Bye.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.674
-You're an excellent liar.
-So are you.

23:43.757 --> 23:45.467
He knows that's blood. He'll be back.

23:46.385 --> 23:47.594
Sorry, guys.

23:49.096 --> 23:51.056
Hey, Eddie. How are you feeling?

23:52.224 --> 23:53.684
Yeah. Better.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.027
Where's my gun?

24:05.571 --> 24:06.613
Where's Natalie?

24:12.160 --> 24:13.161
Natalie?

24:13.996 --> 24:15.289
Natalie, what are you doing?

24:15.372 --> 24:16.957
Stop. Natalie, answer me.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.375
Leave me alone.

24:19.042 --> 24:20.043
Okay.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.173
Natalieâ€¦

24:24.840 --> 24:27.134
Natalie, please. You don't wanna do this.

24:28.886 --> 24:31.638
You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.016
Yes. You're right.

24:34.099 --> 24:37.269
We're strangers. But for some reason,
we're all in the same mess.

24:38.979 --> 24:41.648
How many family members
did you lose tonight?

24:42.941 --> 24:44.693
I have lost people.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.529
And I know how it feels

24:47.613 --> 24:50.324
to blame yourself
for things that aren't your fault.

24:53.118 --> 24:57.539
It is my fault.
I'm the reason she was there.

25:01.084 --> 25:05.297
Mum has already buried
the only man she ever loved,

25:05.380 --> 25:12.012
and Mon-- Monique, she was--
She was the one. She madeâ€¦

25:14.223 --> 25:17.935
She made everything worthwhile for Mum
and for me andâ€¦

25:20.687 --> 25:22.272
She was gonna save the world.

25:23.357 --> 25:24.483
Natalie?

25:25.442 --> 25:29.446
I've got a daughter. She's called Daisy.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.909
And I love her more than I ever thought
I could ever love anything,

25:33.992 --> 25:36.662
and I am telling you, the only thing worse

25:36.745 --> 25:39.039
than your mum finding out
she lost one of her girls

25:39.122 --> 25:41.750
would be finding out she lost both.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.921
She'll never forgive me.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.092
And I'll never forgive myself.

25:51.093 --> 25:52.219
No!

26:00.185 --> 26:01.186
It's okay.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.479
Give that to me.

26:02.563 --> 26:04.565
You didn't kill her. They did.

26:04.648 --> 26:05.899
He's right.

26:05.983 --> 26:07.693
You need to take the safety off.

26:09.111 --> 26:12.030
We've all told lies, okay?

26:12.114 --> 26:13.615
We'll get to the truth.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.708
What did you lie about?

26:37.556 --> 26:41.810
I didn't tell them everything
when they arrested me.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.691
About Leo Newman.

26:50.277 --> 26:53.530
After the college investigation found
no evidence of wrongdoing,

26:53.614 --> 26:54.865
I said I let it go.

26:57.201 --> 26:58.410
But I didn't. Iâ€¦

26:59.912 --> 27:06.126
I thought it must be a cover-up,
so I started a sort of-- a campaign.

27:07.753 --> 27:10.756
Pretended to be other people online,
planted rumors on message boards,

27:10.839 --> 27:13.383
made accusations
about why Leo had got his place.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.845
Then I got a phone call.

27:17.846 --> 27:21.350
I was told if I carried on
smearing Leo Newman and his family,

27:21.433 --> 27:23.268
not only would it cost me my job,

27:23.352 --> 27:25.354
but my reputation would also be destroyed

27:25.437 --> 27:28.232
and I'd lose everything,
including my family.

27:28.315 --> 27:30.526
I was still married then. Soâ€¦

27:32.194 --> 27:33.362
What did you do?

27:35.697 --> 27:38.492
I said, "Fuck you.
How dare you threaten me?"

27:38.575 --> 27:40.577
I was more careful, but I carried on.

27:44.540 --> 27:46.416
Then one day my husband called

27:46.500 --> 27:49.127
to say the school phoned him
while I was in a lecture.

27:52.422 --> 27:55.217
Someone had picked Daisy up
from music practice,

27:55.300 --> 27:57.302
pretending to know me, andâ€¦

28:00.806 --> 28:02.224
and taken her.

28:07.980 --> 28:10.732
We called the police.
I've never been so scared in my life.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.194
Even more than tonight. It wasâ€¦

28:19.741 --> 28:21.952
A few hours later, I got another call.

28:22.953 --> 28:24.246
Saying what?

28:24.329 --> 28:25.914
Where to pick up the kid.

28:27.457 --> 28:30.043
That she'd had a lovely time,
been bought sweets and fizzy drinks,

28:30.127 --> 28:32.171
but don't doubt how serious we are.

28:32.254 --> 28:33.505
Forget about Leo Newman.

28:33.589 --> 28:36.383
Now, not to spoil the ending,
but it'll be light soon.

28:36.466 --> 28:39.636
The guy who phoned with the first warning,
did you get his name?

28:39.720 --> 28:41.930
-How did you know what they said?
-It's classic.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.641
You've done that to people.

28:44.725 --> 28:47.644
You only meet someone like me
if you ignore that one.

28:47.728 --> 28:51.773
I don't get it.
Why won't you tell NCA the whole story?

28:54.818 --> 28:57.696
They were already trying
to say I had a grudge against the Newmans.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.281
It would have made me look more guilty.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.408
But you do have a grudge
against the Newmans.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.118
Yeah, me and a million others.

29:16.089 --> 29:21.094
I took this off the guy
who was sent to kill me.

29:21.178 --> 29:23.472
And he's dead now, isn't he?

29:24.097 --> 29:25.557
If we could get into thisâ€¦

29:34.399 --> 29:35.776
You need a password.

29:40.948 --> 29:42.866
Okay. Okay.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.870
You got something personal of his,
like a phone?

29:47.538 --> 29:48.747
Yeah. I've been through it.

29:50.874 --> 29:53.043
There's nothing
that looks like a password.

29:54.044 --> 29:56.672
That's 'cause
it's not his regular password.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.716
-It's a boot log-in.
-What's that?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.635
Gets you into the BIOS.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.607
Told you I'm not a carpet salesman.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.070
Where's his email?

30:24.950 --> 30:26.118
Empty.

30:27.578 --> 30:31.748
Empty-- Petraeus. Petraeus. Petraeus.

30:35.711 --> 30:39.339
Whoever he was,
he's been emailing someone at CNPR.

30:39.423 --> 30:40.591
How do you know?

30:40.674 --> 30:42.759
Because this stock template was
in the server

30:42.843 --> 30:44.553
they obviously didn't want anyone
to know about.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.431
And if you stop talking for a minute,
I'll tell you more.

30:50.392 --> 30:51.935
-"M. Copeland."
-Who's that?

30:52.769 --> 30:56.398
It's Martin Copeland. He is the COOâ€¦

30:57.816 --> 30:59.902
of Cooper Newman.

31:05.157 --> 31:06.366
Play the latest video.

31:08.076 --> 31:12.998
Okay, listen up. We all appreciate you
keeping this going for Leo's sake,

31:13.081 --> 31:16.043
but Miss Newman will not be making
any statement

31:16.126 --> 31:18.587
-about tonight's communications.
-What is he talking about?

31:18.670 --> 31:21.673
We'll be talking to you
as soon as we have something to say.

31:21.757 --> 31:22.799
What's the connection

31:22.883 --> 31:25.552
between Katherine and the man
in the picture, Eric Cresswell?

31:25.636 --> 31:27.930
We know as much as you do right now, Jill.

31:29.890 --> 31:32.267
-I have nothing more to say. Sorry.
-What "man in the picture"?

31:33.143 --> 31:34.353
Who's Eric Cresswell?

31:35.395 --> 31:37.397
How do you know about the secret server?

31:38.398 --> 31:40.734
-Can somebody tell me what's going on?
-What was that?

31:41.485 --> 31:44.696
-What did you see?
-I don't know. Some movement, I think.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.032
Where?

31:47.115 --> 31:48.951
Over there, between those trees.

31:49.743 --> 31:50.744
Show me.

31:54.498 --> 31:56.333
Just here. Justâ€¦

31:56.875 --> 31:57.876
Hey, hey.

32:16.186 --> 32:17.437
What are they doing?

32:19.565 --> 32:22.192
-Do you think it's the neighbor?
-Or the police.

32:52.764 --> 32:53.765
Yeah.

33:03.775 --> 33:04.985
Who were you phoning?

33:08.197 --> 33:09.198
Fuck you.

33:17.623 --> 33:20.375
Come on. Deep breaths.

33:21.335 --> 33:22.711
Should we go out?

33:22.794 --> 33:23.795
And do what?

33:24.713 --> 33:26.131
And what if they need help?

33:26.215 --> 33:28.342
Sean doesn't seem like the kind of person
who needs your help.

33:28.425 --> 33:30.969
-Thanks. But what about--
-Aadesh is with Sean.

33:36.391 --> 33:40.103
-Did that video say the kidnappers--
-Do you ever stop talking?

33:40.187 --> 33:42.689
I'm sorry to be a pain.
I have been kidnapped and shot tonight.

33:42.773 --> 33:45.901
-So, I am just a little bit fucking tense.
-Which college are you at?

33:47.569 --> 33:48.987
At Oxford, which college?

33:50.197 --> 33:51.490
Wolvesey.

33:52.032 --> 33:54.826
Right. So, you know Professor Cottler?

33:56.578 --> 33:57.704
No.

33:57.788 --> 33:59.164
What the fuck?

34:21.270 --> 34:22.271
What the fuck.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.565
What happened? Jesus.

34:24.648 --> 34:25.732
What's going on?

34:27.234 --> 34:28.235
You all right?

34:31.280 --> 34:32.781
Sean.

34:32.864 --> 34:33.949
Go on.

34:37.077 --> 34:39.788
I found a phone.
I was trying to make a call.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.873
-Who to?
-The police.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.417
-So he says.
-No, it's true.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.085
I was trying to phone that Vanessa woman.

34:46.170 --> 34:50.174
-I really think we can trust her.
-I've told you you can't trust anyone.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.675
Yeah, including you.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.052
Yeah, including you. Exactly.

34:54.136 --> 34:55.804
He says it's not safe to call the police,

34:55.888 --> 34:57.514
but what if it's only him
it's not safe for?

34:57.598 --> 34:58.807
We haven't killed anyone.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.440
You can check if he's telling the truth
from his call history.

35:06.523 --> 35:08.942
Yeah, but I didn't actually
get to dial before he destroyed it.

35:09.026 --> 35:11.778
Swear down, it's true. I just--
I want this to be over, you guys.

35:13.197 --> 35:14.239
I don't buy it.

35:14.323 --> 35:16.742
The Forrest Gump act, yeah.

35:16.825 --> 35:19.620
We know he's smarter
than he looks. He fucking has to be.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.121
I agree.

35:22.080 --> 35:24.791
He ran out as soon as you asked him
about Martin Copeland.

35:25.334 --> 35:27.336
And if you're involved in this,

35:27.419 --> 35:30.005
that means you're part of the reason
Monique's dead,

35:30.088 --> 35:31.507
and you deserve to die

35:31.590 --> 35:34.676
in the middle of nowhere
just like she did.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.178
I'm warming to you.

35:36.261 --> 35:39.431
Okay, Natalie. Okay, okay.

35:45.103 --> 35:46.104
I'll tell you.

35:46.188 --> 35:47.648
Tell us what?

35:51.693 --> 35:52.986
Martin Copelandâ€¦

35:55.072 --> 35:59.284
came to my meeting in New York in person.

36:01.870 --> 36:03.956
-I couldn't believe it.
-Neither can I.

36:04.039 --> 36:06.583
Yeah, but, you see, the thing is
that what I did, right--

36:06.667 --> 36:10.796
One of the strategies I use
to sell my services is basicallyâ€¦

36:12.297 --> 36:13.298
I hacked them.

36:15.592 --> 36:18.220
Yeah, man. I hacked Cooper Newman.

36:18.303 --> 36:21.598
And then I told them what I'd done.
You see, I say,

36:21.682 --> 36:24.434
"Imagine if I wasn't a good guy,
right, who'd done this.

36:24.518 --> 36:28.230
Imagine if it was a baddie.
The damage I could do to your company.

36:28.313 --> 36:32.693
So employ me, and I'll stop the baddies
because only I know all their tricks."

36:32.776 --> 36:35.112
I take it you didn't tell
your friend Vanessa that part.

36:37.114 --> 36:38.532
I didn't tell my wife that part.

36:39.867 --> 36:42.703
He still wouldn't have met you. What else?

36:42.786 --> 36:44.496
What do you mean what else?
There's nothing else.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.164
-I don't believe you.
-Me neither.

36:46.248 --> 36:47.541
No. It's true, guys, I swear.

36:47.624 --> 36:51.211
I can't tell you why he was there,
but he was and that's it.

36:51.295 --> 36:52.796
That's all I know. All right?

36:54.298 --> 36:56.300
-What did you see?
-What do you mean? Where?

36:56.383 --> 36:58.969
You hacked their systems,
found a secret server,

36:59.052 --> 37:01.013
and presumably had a good look around.
What did you see?

37:01.096 --> 37:02.764
All sorts. I can't remember.
That wasn't the point.

37:02.848 --> 37:05.225
-Did you copy anything?
-What? I wasn't trying to blackmail them.

37:05.309 --> 37:08.228
-Although, technicallyâ€¦
-Think, think. We're running out of time.

37:08.312 --> 37:11.231
I don't know. All sorts of strategy stuff.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.400
Client briefs, financial reports.
Mostly boring.

37:13.483 --> 37:14.902
The only interesting things were emails.

37:14.985 --> 37:17.196
-You read people's private emails?
-No. Yeah.

37:17.279 --> 37:19.072
-Copeland's?
-Copeland's, yeah. Katherine Newman's.

37:19.156 --> 37:21.033
I knew about the ambassador thing
before it happened.

37:21.116 --> 37:22.284
Was the son mentioned?

37:22.367 --> 37:23.994
Yeah. They were making
succession plans about--

37:24.077 --> 37:25.913
-Who's doing that?
-Copeland.

37:25.996 --> 37:29.082
There was stuff about it being a new day.
A fresh start. Blah, blah, blah.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.835
-Who were those emails to?
-I don't fucking know!

37:32.503 --> 37:35.130
All right? I don't fucking know!

37:36.256 --> 37:38.675
Okay. What do we know?

37:39.885 --> 37:41.512
At the event I spoke at,

37:42.095 --> 37:46.391
Leo Newman was given formal responsibility
for running the Cooper Newman Foundation.

37:46.475 --> 37:50.687
Yeah. The shell company had me moving
a lot of money the past few months.

37:50.771 --> 37:53.023
Well, even if Copeland's nose was
put out of joint,

37:53.106 --> 37:54.525
how does kidnapping Leo help him?

38:01.448 --> 38:02.908
Anybody got any ideas?

38:10.332 --> 38:11.333
Where are you going?

38:14.294 --> 38:16.088
Sean, where are you going?

38:16.171 --> 38:17.798
It will be light soon. I need to change.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.425
Then I've got a few questions
for the organ-grinder.

38:20.509 --> 38:21.969
You're going to speak to Copeland?

38:22.052 --> 38:24.888
He's the link, isn't he?
He's what we've all got in common.

38:24.972 --> 38:28.141
Except you, student.
What's your connection to Copeland?

38:28.225 --> 38:30.227
I haven't got one as far as I know.

38:30.310 --> 38:34.106
What about your dad?
His business, it's in America, isn't it?

38:34.189 --> 38:35.774
America's massive.

38:35.858 --> 38:37.150
What exactly are you gonna do?

38:37.234 --> 38:40.153
My livelihood's gone.
One way or another, someone has to pay.

38:40.237 --> 38:42.364
But, what--
Are you actually going to New York?

38:42.906 --> 38:46.577
Wait, if Martin Copeland did this
to my family, to me,

38:46.660 --> 38:49.079
then I wanna know why, same as you.

38:50.289 --> 38:51.623
-I'm coming with you.
-No way.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.292
You owe me.

38:53.375 --> 38:56.253
Actually, I'd say we're even.

38:56.336 --> 38:59.882
And given the fact that I'm armed,
I'd quit while you're ahead.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.216
I can help you.

39:02.259 --> 39:03.468
There's more money.

39:05.095 --> 39:07.181
You wouldn't have hung around
if you had cash.

39:07.264 --> 39:08.891
How are you gonna get to America?

39:14.021 --> 39:15.731
NCA will have frozen
everything you've got.

39:16.481 --> 39:17.649
When they released us,

39:17.733 --> 39:21.111
I went to work and moved what was left
of the client account balance offshore.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.197
-They won't trace it in time.
-Why?

39:23.280 --> 39:24.281
What?

39:25.324 --> 39:26.491
Why did you do that?

39:27.576 --> 39:30.704
Because I thought I might still be able
to marry the man I love.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.920
-Hundred K.
-Natalie, what are you doing?

39:42.424 --> 39:44.635
Maybe I'll just torture you
till you transfer the money.

39:45.219 --> 39:46.720
Do I look like I care about dying?

39:54.937 --> 39:56.522
Change fast.

39:56.605 --> 39:59.024
There'll be a shirt or something
that fits you.

39:59.107 --> 40:00.943
Find a hat or glasses. Do your hair.

40:01.026 --> 40:02.861
Anything that alters
the shape of your head.

40:05.614 --> 40:09.201
Confuses facial recognition software.
So he's done this before.

40:09.993 --> 40:11.078
What about you?

40:52.119 --> 40:54.788
The latest communication
from the kidnappers

40:54.872 --> 40:55.998
came yesterday evening.

40:56.081 --> 40:58.792
And in the hours since,
investigators have been desperately trying

40:58.876 --> 41:02.337
to track the man identified
in the kidnapper's latest video

41:02.421 --> 41:04.131
as Eric Cresswell.

41:04.214 --> 41:05.465
A disgraced British scientist,

41:05.549 --> 41:07.634
Cresswell was forced
to resign from his post

41:07.718 --> 41:10.721
at Cambrook University
after an investigation,

41:10.804 --> 41:13.223
but no further details were made available
at the time.

41:13.307 --> 41:17.144
And the university has so far declined
to comment about their former employee.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.815
His connection to Katherine Newman
and what precisely the truth is

41:21.899 --> 41:23.358
remains a mystery.

41:23.442 --> 41:25.652
-Who's he?
-I don't know.

41:27.154 --> 41:29.448
Was there anything aboutâ€¦

41:30.532 --> 41:31.533
No.

41:38.248 --> 41:40.375
Can you help with this?

41:41.251 --> 41:42.252
Yeah.

41:47.299 --> 41:48.967
You sure you know what you're doing?

41:50.135 --> 41:51.136
No.

41:51.762 --> 41:53.388
But I have to do something.

42:00.437 --> 42:02.981
He's dangerous.
You know that better than anyone.

42:03.065 --> 42:04.483
There has to be another way.

42:05.067 --> 42:06.860
Well, I'm all ears

42:06.944 --> 42:10.405
'cause right now, I don't feel like
I've got any other option.

42:13.534 --> 42:14.535
What about you?

42:16.787 --> 42:18.247
I mean, do you know what you're doing?

42:20.374 --> 42:22.751
Like you say, he's dangerous.

42:22.835 --> 42:25.045
Do you really think
he's gonna let you walk out of here

42:25.128 --> 42:26.755
knowing where he's going and why?

42:28.423 --> 42:30.676
-He--
-He only shot me in the chest

42:30.759 --> 42:32.886
because he thought
I might still be useful. He's ruthless.

42:32.970 --> 42:34.596
So how can you trust him?

42:35.806 --> 42:37.516
Who said anything about trust?

42:39.226 --> 42:41.228
Can't go back,
and he's the only way forward.

42:42.479 --> 42:44.898
-What about your mum?
-She's strong.

42:46.316 --> 42:47.484
She's had to be.

42:50.445 --> 42:51.655
It's different for you.

42:52.739 --> 42:53.949
You've got a kid.

42:54.491 --> 42:55.576
As things stand,

42:55.659 --> 42:57.870
I'll lose any chance I had of
getting her back.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.330
I'll lose everything.

43:33.113 --> 43:34.114
Well, frankly,

43:34.198 --> 43:37.492
a scenario in which those responsible
ask for anything other than hard cash,

43:37.576 --> 43:41.538
unless it's politically motivated,
is already highly unusual.

43:41.622 --> 43:44.666
Do you believe then
that Newman's kidnap could be political?

43:44.750 --> 43:48.670
Perhaps even terrorist-related?
There has been speculation--

43:48.754 --> 43:50.506
I think if that's what we're seeing here,

43:50.589 --> 43:52.841
then it's potentially
a new strain of terrorism.

43:53.467 --> 43:55.928
Let's call it ethical terrorism.

43:56.011 --> 43:57.513
Ethical terrorism?

43:59.723 --> 44:00.933
Sounds pretty cool.

44:01.016 --> 44:03.852
"Cool"? My parents are gonna kill me.

44:03.936 --> 44:06.396
I haven't spoken to mine.
God knows what they're thinking.

44:07.189 --> 44:08.565
They might not be that surprised.

44:08.649 --> 44:09.816
They always expected their son

44:09.900 --> 44:13.529
to be hunted down by at least two
international law enforcement agencies?

44:13.612 --> 44:18.825
It is the latest in a long line
of fuckups, headaches, letdowns. For them.

44:21.620 --> 44:22.829
For Sonia.

44:31.797 --> 44:33.173
At least we're consistent.

44:35.384 --> 44:39.596
So, what do we do now, partner?

44:40.222 --> 44:42.432
Surely we can trust that Vanessa.

44:42.516 --> 44:45.644
Yeah, maybe, but even if she believes us,
what about Sonia and her family?

44:46.270 --> 44:49.106
And my parents, the university?
Are they going to take our word for it?

44:50.274 --> 44:54.778
-But if no one can prove that we did it--
-That's different to proving we didn't.

44:54.862 --> 44:56.405
How do you prove a negative?

45:01.535 --> 45:02.536
It's confusing.

45:02.619 --> 45:05.122
Not only for the authorities,
but also for the public.

45:05.205 --> 45:09.835
We're talking about a crime here,
and yet popular support is split

45:09.918 --> 45:13.839
between sympathy for a mother
who's missing her son

45:13.922 --> 45:16.550
and these faces of a growing movement

45:16.633 --> 45:22.472
that is sick and tired of being lied to
again and again by public figures.

45:25.684 --> 45:27.311
-That's us fucked, then.
-Exactly.

45:27.394 --> 45:31.273
Without any proof of our innocence,
the damage is already done, isn't it?

45:31.356 --> 45:33.192
Assuming he lets us leave here.

45:33.817 --> 45:35.569
What, you don't think he's planning to--

45:35.652 --> 45:40.407
Yeah. No. I don't know,
but I do think he's right.

45:40.490 --> 45:41.617
We can't trust anyone.

45:41.700 --> 45:44.912
And even if that goes for the five of us,
at least we know the rules.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.459
Wait, are you suggesting
that we should all go to--

45:50.542 --> 45:51.793
Got to bloody America.

45:51.877 --> 45:53.837
I can't quite believe it either, but yes.

45:55.464 --> 45:59.551
Unless any of you have any better ideas.
But just to remind you, you came to me.

45:59.635 --> 46:06.433
One second. Tara, you're saying
the five most wanted people in the UK

46:07.142 --> 46:11.063
should try to cross one of
the most secure borders in the world

46:11.146 --> 46:17.444
to return to the scene of the crime
they're accused of, in order to confront

46:17.528 --> 46:21.406
the crazy, powerful man
they think might have framed them

46:21.490 --> 46:25.911
for reasons no one seems to be able
to even guess at.

46:26.495 --> 46:27.579
And you're a professor?

46:27.663 --> 46:30.249
I'm not a fucking professor.
I'm a junior research fellow.

46:30.332 --> 46:32.876
I was-- Whatever.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.920
What about your daughter?

46:37.047 --> 46:40.884
She's all I've got,
but I'm not all she's got.

46:43.220 --> 46:45.055
And whatever happens, it's up to me

46:45.138 --> 46:48.308
to show her
you have to challenge injustice.

46:48.392 --> 46:49.601
Whatever it takes.

46:51.144 --> 46:52.479
You can't be taking this seriously.

46:52.563 --> 46:56.483
If they try to grab us again,
we are easier to pick off on our own.

46:57.109 --> 46:59.987
And New York is the last place
anybody expects us to be.

47:00.070 --> 47:01.655
Yes, because it's a stupid idea.

47:02.364 --> 47:06.660
Everything you're saying is true.
It's just-- What else have we got?

47:12.082 --> 47:13.917
He won't agree to it anyway.

47:32.477 --> 47:33.562
The police, please.

47:39.818 --> 47:40.819
Sorry.

47:41.737 --> 47:43.071
I was looking for you.

47:43.155 --> 47:44.156
We've been talking,

47:44.239 --> 47:46.867
and we've decided we should all go
to get the truth from Copeland.

47:46.950 --> 47:49.203
-Really?
-I know how it sounds,

47:49.953 --> 47:51.455
but it does make sense.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.665
-How?
-Because you need us.

47:55.918 --> 47:58.003
Do you really think
they've told you everything?

48:01.757 --> 48:04.218
-What about you?
-I'm an open book.

48:08.764 --> 48:10.307
Natalie would be dead now.

48:10.390 --> 48:11.600
You think?

48:12.726 --> 48:15.145
What do you mean?
She didn't know the safety was on.

48:15.229 --> 48:16.480
Or she did.

48:18.106 --> 48:21.443
Now I see why you're not a professor.

48:21.527 --> 48:23.529
It doesn't take much to fool you, does it?

48:23.612 --> 48:26.073
Maybe, but I'm perceptive in other ways.

48:28.242 --> 48:31.620
We're all a piece of this puzzle, Sean,
and you can't solve it without us.

48:32.287 --> 48:34.206
You've only got this far
because of Aadesh.

48:36.333 --> 48:37.960
At least think about it.

49:41.064 --> 49:42.482
Did you call the police?

49:47.487 --> 49:50.908
Don't lie to me, David, or I will know.

49:58.332 --> 50:01.543
Find a hat, coat, anything you can grab.

50:02.628 --> 50:04.588
We're going. Now.

50:10.010 --> 50:11.011
Come on.

50:23.815 --> 50:25.317
Get in.

50:28.070 --> 50:29.154
Wait, what's the rush?

50:50.425 --> 50:52.427
We need to switch vehicles fast.

50:57.933 --> 50:59.893
Get down. All of you. Now.
