WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:09.511
paw patrol, paw patrol

00:09.509 --> 00:12.809
we'll be there on
the double

00:12.813 --> 00:14.413
whenever there's a problem

00:14.414 --> 00:16.984
round adventure bay

00:16.983 --> 00:18.583
ryder and his team of pups

00:18.585 --> 00:20.015
will come and save
the day

00:20.020 --> 00:22.220
marshall, rubble, chase,

00:22.222 --> 00:23.562
rocky, zuma, skye

00:23.557 --> 00:25.517
yeah, they're on
the way

00:25.525 --> 00:27.385
paw patrol, paw patrol

00:27.394 --> 00:30.064
whenever you're
in trouble

00:30.063 --> 00:31.533
paw patrol, paw patrol

00:31.531 --> 00:33.461
we'll be there on
the double

00:33.466 --> 00:35.526
no job is too big,
no pup is too small

00:35.535 --> 00:39.135
paw patrol,
we're on a roll!

00:39.139 --> 00:41.309
so here we go
paw patrol

00:41.308 --> 00:42.608
whoa-oh-oh

00:42.609 --> 00:43.579
paw patrol

00:43.577 --> 00:45.107
whoa-oh-oh-oh

00:45.111 --> 00:46.611
paw patrol

00:53.887 --> 00:57.117
Goodway:
Magnificent!

00:57.123 --> 01:00.933
Yep, that's one super
duper jake cake.

01:00.927 --> 01:04.527
With a dandy dollop of everest.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.271
No doubt our birthday boy
will be giddy with glee

01:07.267 --> 01:10.127
When he sees it.

01:10.136 --> 01:11.236
Booyah!

01:11.238 --> 01:12.198
(phone ringing)

01:12.205 --> 01:13.435
Ryder:
<i> Hey, mayor goodway.</i>

01:13.440 --> 01:15.170
<i> Just calling to see</i>
<i> if jake's ice cream cake</i>

01:15.175 --> 01:17.305
<i> Is ready for</i>
<i> his surprise party.</i>

01:17.310 --> 01:20.280
This one's ready
for the record books.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.910
Wow! He's going to love it!

01:22.916 --> 01:24.616
You guys are a great
cake-making crew.

01:24.618 --> 01:28.918
<i> Thanks, ryder. We tried to use</i>
<i>all of jake's favourite fruits.</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:31.022
<i> Yes, lots and lots of mangoes.</i>

01:31.024 --> 01:34.364
Now we just need to get it up to
to jake's lodge before sundown.

01:34.361 --> 01:37.501
That's when the big surprise
party happens.

01:37.497 --> 01:38.597
<i> I'll get the van.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:40.158
<i> On our way.</i>

01:40.166 --> 01:42.666
Time to check on everest.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.366
(birds chirping)

01:45.372 --> 01:47.272
Hi, ryder.
I just finished decorating.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.614
<i> Great job. I just hope jake</i>
<i> doesn't know about his party.</i>

01:50.610 --> 01:53.610
Don't worry.
I kept him away from the lodge.

01:53.613 --> 01:58.083
He's busy cleaning the treads
on my snow cat.

01:58.084 --> 02:00.594
Okay, everest, all done.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.087
Your snow cat is ready to roll,

02:03.089 --> 02:05.419
You know, in case you want to
take me some place

02:05.425 --> 02:09.585
'cause it's sort of
a special day.

02:09.596 --> 02:13.126
You're right. I almost forgot.

02:13.133 --> 02:18.103
It's the day, umm, I go to
katie's to get my, uhh,

02:18.104 --> 02:20.004
Fur fluffed.

02:20.006 --> 02:23.336
Oh, okay. See you.

02:23.343 --> 02:23.983
Wait!

02:23.977 --> 02:25.437
You need to come with me
'cause, umm,

02:25.445 --> 02:28.145
There's nothing fun
to do up here.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.518
I guess you're right.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.547
(giggling)

02:38.959 --> 02:40.689
(whistling)

02:40.694 --> 02:41.394
Oh, dear.

02:41.394 --> 02:46.564
I'm afraid we made our great,
big cake too big for your van.

02:46.566 --> 02:47.126
Yep.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.273
Well, then we'll just have to

02:48.268 --> 02:50.998
Carry it up
the mountain ourselves.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.014
(grunting)

02:54.007 --> 02:56.537
Oh, I knew the recipe was wrong.

02:56.543 --> 03:00.083
1,000 mangoes
in a birthday cake is a lot.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.010
It's way too heavy.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.384
We'll never get this
up the mountain in time.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.224
Never say never,

03:05.218 --> 03:09.748
Especially when we have a
determination and paw patrol.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.216
Help!

03:11.224 --> 03:12.494
Ryder:
What's the matter, mayor?

03:12.492 --> 03:15.032
<i> Jake's cake is too big</i>
<i> for mr. Porter's van</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:16.998
And too heavy to carry.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.027
<i> Don't worry, mayor.</i>

03:18.031 --> 03:19.701
<i> We'll get it there in time</i>
<i> to surprise him.</i>

03:19.699 --> 03:23.739
<i> No cake is too big,</i>
<i> no pup is too small.</i>

03:23.737 --> 03:25.337
(beeping)

03:25.338 --> 03:27.038
Paw patrol, to the lookout.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.440
Ryder needs us!
Ryder needs us!

03:29.442 --> 03:31.742
(gasping)

03:31.745 --> 03:34.545
Uh-oh.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.447
Whoa!

03:36.449 --> 03:37.619
Watch out!

03:37.617 --> 03:40.047
(grunting)

03:40.053 --> 03:42.593
Sorry. I'm feeling kind of blue.

03:42.589 --> 03:46.059
And pink and green and orange.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.629
(laughing)

03:50.000 --> 03:56.074

03:57.470 --> 04:00.640
(elevator dinging)

04:03.109 --> 04:05.609
Paw patrol, ready for action,
ryder, sir.

04:05.612 --> 04:09.482
Good, because we've got
a big mission.

04:09.482 --> 04:10.652
We have to deliver jake's

04:10.650 --> 04:13.650
Super-sized surprise birthday
cake up to his party.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.392
And we've got to do it
before sunset.

04:16.389 --> 04:20.119
Rocky, you'll need to rig up
a special cake-towing wagon

04:20.125 --> 04:22.186
From recycled parts.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.125
Don't lose it. Reuse it.

04:24.130 --> 04:27.400
Rubble, you'll use your
powerful construction rig

04:27.400 --> 04:31.370
To tow the heavy cake and wagon
up the steep slope.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.671
Rubble on the double.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.643
All you other pups,

04:34.641 --> 04:37.841
Remember to meet us
up at jake's lodge by sunset.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.814
Yeah, so we can all yell--

04:39.813 --> 04:41.683
"surprise!"
"surprise!"

04:41.681 --> 04:45.381
All right,
paw patrol is on a roll!

04:45.385 --> 04:49.415
(barking)

04:49.422 --> 04:50.692
paw patrol

04:50.690 --> 04:54.290
go, go, go, go, go, go

04:54.294 --> 04:55.434
paw patrol

04:55.428 --> 04:59.828
go, go, go, go, go, go, go

05:06.706 --> 05:07.566
rocky

05:07.574 --> 05:13.214
go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go

05:13.213 --> 05:14.253
paw patrol

05:14.247 --> 05:18.547
go, go, go, go, go, go

05:18.551 --> 05:19.421
rubble

05:19.419 --> 05:24.659
go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go

05:24.657 --> 05:28.287
paw patrol, paw patrol

05:28.294 --> 05:31.334
(tires screeching)

05:46.913 --> 05:50.353
(beeping)

05:52.485 --> 05:55.315
The jake cake wagon
is ready to roll.

05:55.321 --> 05:56.251
Good job, rocky.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.786
Let it down easy, rubble.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.931
Will do, ryder.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.774
The jake cake has landed.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.539
(squawking)

06:11.538 --> 06:14.838
Hitch is secure.
Next stop: Jake's mountain.

06:14.841 --> 06:18.381
You'd better hurry. Jake's party
is supposed to start soon.

06:18.378 --> 06:23.308
We'll lead everyone else up
where jake won't see us.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.352
(grinding)

06:29.656 --> 06:33.216
That cake is heavy.

06:36.329 --> 06:36.929
Go ahead, ryder.

06:36.930 --> 06:41.270
Everest, it may take longer to
deliver the cake than I thought.

06:41.267 --> 06:45.637
<i> Can you keep jake away from</i>
<i> the lodge a little longer?</i>

06:45.638 --> 06:47.738
I'll find something
to keep him busy.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.010
Thanks for the fur fluff, katie.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.678
No problem, everest.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.947
Why don't we go back
to the lodge now?

06:53.947 --> 06:54.807
Maybe go for a hike?

06:54.814 --> 06:58.524
Or do something fun, like,
with balloons.

06:58.518 --> 07:02.618
Sure, jake, right after, umm...

07:02.622 --> 07:03.352
(gasping)

07:03.356 --> 07:06.356
Jake, I think you missed
a spot of dirt on the treads.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.589
Cap'n turbot,
I'm here with jake.

07:08.595 --> 07:13.295
Jake, I think cap'n turbot needs
some help with the flounder.

07:13.299 --> 07:17.899
Uhh, yes, my boat's got a bevy
of barnacles that need brushing.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.844
Did you hear that, jake?
We get to scrape off barnacles.

07:21.841 --> 07:25.911
Barnacles, what a blast.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.287
This cake weighs a tonne.

07:36.289 --> 07:40.019
That's why we can't go
any faster.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.526
(grinding)

07:46.733 --> 07:48.033
See you up at the party.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.704
We'll be waiting for you.

07:49.702 --> 07:50.902
Going to be lots of fun.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.513
Be careful with the cake.

07:54.507 --> 07:55.007
(gasping)

07:55.008 --> 07:59.038
Uh-oh, the sun's melting
ice cream, jake.

07:59.045 --> 08:03.405
Zuma, I need you
to come back fast.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.718
What's wrong, ryder?

08:06.719 --> 08:07.949
The jake cake is melting.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.794
I need your hovercraft vents
to cool it off.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.520
I'll get it totally cool.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.596
It worked.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.065
Okay, let's keep going.

08:34.547 --> 08:40.116
So, these are barnacles.
Definitely not fun.

08:48.795 --> 08:49.525
(grinding)

08:49.529 --> 08:53.399
Come on, engine, you can do it.
You can do it.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.069
You can-- yikes!

08:57.937 --> 09:01.737
(gasping)

09:01.741 --> 09:03.041
Chase, cake on the loose.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.612
We need your speed
and your safety net.

09:05.611 --> 09:08.681
<i> Chase is on the cake case.</i>

09:08.681 --> 09:12.121
(siren wailing)

09:12.118 --> 09:14.788
I caught up to it.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.587
Net!

09:21.594 --> 09:23.894
I got it!

09:23.896 --> 09:25.956
So close.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.025
Cones!

09:30.870 --> 09:33.970
Nice work, chase.
The cake looks fine.

09:33.973 --> 09:38.643
Well, except for that.
The sun is starting to go down.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.114
The party's going to start soon.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.153
We've got to get this cake
up the mountain fast.

09:42.148 --> 09:46.548
But it's too steep.
And the cake's too heavy.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.082
Yeah.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.516
Even my rig's engine doesn't
have enough power to pull it.

09:50.523 --> 09:54.663
Then let's make
a cake-pulling pup train.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.188
Hooray!

09:57.196 --> 09:58.496
Let's do this!

09:58.498 --> 09:59.728
Yeah!

09:59.732 --> 10:03.602
Yeah! Wahoo!

10:06.472 --> 10:08.472
Ryder, we're going to
have to hurry

10:08.474 --> 10:11.444
To beat jake and everest
to the lodge.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.684
Faster, pups.

10:13.679 --> 10:17.479
We can do it!
We can do it!

10:17.483 --> 10:18.753
(grinding)

10:18.751 --> 10:22.721
Ryder, maybe we can't do it.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.492
I bet we can
when we're all here.

10:25.491 --> 10:28.631
Everest, we're almost, uhh,
you know where.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.658
But we need you
for an important rescue.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.034
Off the trail,
everest won't fail.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.933
A rescue? That might be fun.

10:35.935 --> 10:40.635
Ryder:
<i> Actually, this situation</i>
<i> is for pups only.</i>

10:40.640 --> 10:43.970
Everest, you need to come alone.

10:43.976 --> 10:44.936
<i> Sorry, jake.</i>

10:44.944 --> 10:47.784
Uhh, do you mind walking
the rest of the way?

10:47.780 --> 10:52.750
Nah. I don't have
anywhere else to be.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.193
I'm here, ryder. What can I do?

10:55.188 --> 11:01.258
Join our pup train. And give us
all the power you got.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.830
Grapple!

11:10.069 --> 11:11.769
We did it!

11:11.771 --> 11:12.241
Woo!

11:12.238 --> 11:17.808
Well, it's already sundown.
My birthday's almost over.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.082
Surprise!
Surprise!

11:21.080 --> 11:24.080
Wow! So, you did
remember my birthday!

11:24.083 --> 11:29.623
Of course we did, jake.
And check out your cake.

11:31.224 --> 11:35.234
Awesome cake. Dibs on my nose.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.628
(laughing)

11:36.629 --> 11:39.099
Thanks, everybody.
This is the best.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.728
Hey, whenever you need some
birthday fun, yell--

11:42.735 --> 11:45.265
"surprise!"
"surprise!"

11:45.271 --> 11:48.611
(howling)
