WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.836
- <i>Previously on</i> the strain.
- You've grown old,

00:03.838 --> 00:08.707
8230385. Surprised to see me?

00:08.709 --> 00:12.611
- You look exactly the same.
- 206 passengers are dead.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.347
And we don't know why.
4 passengers survived

00:15.349 --> 00:18.684
And we don't know why.
- There's no answer to why us,

00:18.686 --> 00:21.186
It's just random luck.
But I'll take it.

00:22.822 --> 00:25.290
- Why do you want that list,
anyway?

00:25.292 --> 00:27.793
- I'm going to visit their
families. Pay my respects.

00:27.795 --> 00:32.631
- Now that you mention it.
- A-- ooh!

00:32.633 --> 00:35.067
I know a urologist
who might be persuaded

00:35.069 --> 00:37.703
To make an emergency house call.
- You have two bosses now,

00:37.705 --> 00:43.175
Jim kent. The ones you
report to at the cdc and me.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.877
- They paid me a little bit
of money to do 'em a favor

00:44.879 --> 00:46.812
Alright? And then the favors
kept getting bigger and bigger.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.847
- And you waited until now
to tell us?

00:48.849 --> 00:51.817
- I would do anything
to keep my wife alive.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.353
(growling)
- ah!

00:54.355 --> 00:57.322
- You're going to murder
everyone on that list of yours?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.958
(growling)
- yes.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.031
- Of course. You know

01:06.033 --> 01:09.268
The serenade for the eclipse
concert is mr. Bolivar's

01:09.270 --> 01:12.438
Number one priority.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.675
I understand that, sean,
and I will do my best.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.044
I'll let you know as soon
as I have a firm answer.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.747
Thank you.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.016
- I'm doctor evanston.
The urologist.

01:24.018 --> 01:26.518
- Ruby wain, mr. Bolivar's
manager.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.254
Thank you so much for coming
on short notice.

01:31.724 --> 01:34.793
- Dr. Box said it was urgent.
- It is.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.429
The concert is tomorrow,
mr. Bolivar isn't doing well

01:37.431 --> 01:40.132
At all. I don't know if it's
this plane thing,

01:40.134 --> 01:42.768
But it's vital that we get him
on that stage tomorrow.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.870
And this goes without saying -
your discretion is

01:44.872 --> 01:47.773
Of the utmost importance.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.548
Gabe?

01:56.550 --> 01:59.785
Dr. Evanston's here.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.701
(whispers of the master)

02:19.072 --> 02:21.473
- Mr. Bolivar...

02:21.475 --> 02:24.076
I'm dr. Evanston, the urologist.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.812
(quiet growling)

02:26.814 --> 02:28.914
- Can I do three o'clock?

02:28.916 --> 02:31.283
Yes, a full mani-pedi.

02:31.285 --> 02:35.354
Oh, no, no, no. That won't work.
Let me do chiang instead.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.789
Ok, well then how about four?
- Ah! Oh my g--

02:37.791 --> 02:41.160
(thump!)
(wain hangs up.)

02:47.267 --> 02:49.868
- Gabe...?

02:54.140 --> 02:57.676
Dr. Evanston?

02:59.279 --> 03:02.247
Gabe, are you in here?

03:04.150 --> 03:06.652
(dr. Evanston whimpering.)

03:06.654 --> 03:09.021
Gabe are you ok?

03:10.790 --> 03:13.859
- Rrrrhhh...

03:17.197 --> 03:21.200
- Mine!
(dr. Evanston breathes heavily)

03:21.202 --> 03:24.136
- Ah! Ahhh!

03:24.138 --> 03:28.207
- (bolivar): Mine...
- Oh god! Please help me--

03:30.076 --> 03:33.579
- Ow! Shit!
Ahh.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.781
H-- oh!

03:40.853 --> 03:43.288
- (evanston): Ahhhhhh!!!!

03:59.872 --> 04:04.076
(dialing)
- come on. Come on. Answer!

04:06.746 --> 04:09.114
It's-- it's me. It's me.
Something happened.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.484
No, no, no, no.
The concert is cancelled.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.855
(whispering): Sh-- oww

04:16.857 --> 04:19.391
D-- no! Just stop--
listen-- listen, listen to me!

04:19.393 --> 04:22.461
It's gabe I think he's um--

04:22.463 --> 04:25.931
He's hurt someone. Bad.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.934
Like, permanently bad.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.069
Of course I didn't
call the police.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.772
I haven't talked to anyone.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.241
At the townhouse.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.610
He's still there.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.582
Are you sure?

04:43.584 --> 04:47.552
You have somebody
that can do that?

04:47.554 --> 04:51.223
Cause I can't be connected
to this in any way.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.330
- We should call someone.
- Who do you suggest?

04:58.332 --> 05:02.834
The police? I just got out of
jail and have no wish to return.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.570
But if you'd like to spend the
next few vital days in custody

05:05.572 --> 05:08.640
To appease your guilt,
be my guest.

05:10.410 --> 05:14.146
This... Scourge we're now
witnessing

05:14.148 --> 05:16.581
Has existed for millennia.

05:16.583 --> 05:20.652
It is a corruption
of both flesh and spirit.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.423
It ravages what is human
in its victim.

05:24.425 --> 05:28.860
Instills a raging thirst.
That is his goal -

05:28.862 --> 05:31.163
To destroy humanity.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.032
- "his" goal? Who's he?

05:34.034 --> 05:37.002
- The master.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.205
- The master. Is that a...
Proper name?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.774
- I suppose you might call him
"patient zero".

05:42.776 --> 05:46.778
He spreads his virus through
the parasites in his blood,

05:46.780 --> 05:50.549
Driven by his horrible will.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.818
- Do you know why there are
different rates of infection

05:52.820 --> 05:55.554
Between the "dead" passengers
and the survivors?

05:55.556 --> 05:59.491
- Some people get the flu
and have a sniffle. Some die.

05:59.493 --> 06:04.229
- Well this master... Why would
he let four passengers live?

06:04.231 --> 06:08.400
- The media focuses on
the miraculous survival of four

06:08.402 --> 06:11.570
As opposed to the deaths of 200,
allowing the dead

06:11.572 --> 06:14.706
Time to change, return home
and spread the disease.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.143
The master excels at
manipulation and disinformation.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.480
Which is why they created
a scapegoat,

06:21.482 --> 06:23.815
The unfortunate regis ceo.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.685
- So it's a disease,
but it has an intelligence?

06:26.687 --> 06:29.488
- What I can say is that
this was all planned.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.556
Not just the events
on the plane,

06:31.558 --> 06:33.558
But the fallout
surrounding it.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.696
- Ok. Who is he?

06:37.698 --> 06:43.502
- An ancient creature. Who feeds
on the blood of his victims.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.504
- Like a vampire.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.607
- I use the term <i>strigoi .</i>

06:48.609 --> 06:52.244
- Which is what? "vampire" in...
- Romanian.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.680
- Oh.
- Now, take away the cape.

06:55.682 --> 07:00.385
The fangs. The accent.
He's a predator, a leech,

07:00.387 --> 07:03.955
A blemish. And I know it's--
it's hard to believe.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.626
Even I didn't at first.

07:07.628 --> 07:11.296
- How do you know all this?

07:11.298 --> 07:14.132
- When I was a little boy,

07:14.134 --> 07:16.568
My grandmother,

07:16.570 --> 07:21.039
My <i>bubbeh meiseh,</i> told me fairy
stories about the <i>strigoi ,</i>

07:21.041 --> 07:26.645
About the master. I thought
they were only stories

07:26.647 --> 07:31.450
Until I... Saw the devil
with my own eyes.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.455
(train whistle blows)

07:46.265 --> 07:48.066
Once we're there, you'll be able
to stretch your legs,

07:48.068 --> 07:52.070
<i>Bubbeh</i> . Hopefully it won't
be too much longer.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.740
- This train I would not wish
to go any faster.

07:55.742 --> 08:01.246
I don't think we will be happy
to arrive at our destination.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.315
- We don't know that.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.952
- Don't be naive.
- Abraham...

08:06.954 --> 08:11.823
Remember the stories I told you.
Evil lurks in this world

08:11.825 --> 08:14.826
And I fear we are soon
to meet it.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.844
(panicked chatter)

08:34.514 --> 08:37.682
- ... Oout!

08:37.684 --> 08:41.486
Out!
(dogs barking)

08:41.488 --> 08:43.188
(guard yells in german)

08:45.024 --> 08:47.292
- On behalf of the camp
administration,

08:47.294 --> 08:50.962
I bid you welcome.
- (guard): <i>Asta, weiter</i> .

08:50.964 --> 08:54.366
- Just as our soldiers risk
their lives, you will work here

08:54.368 --> 08:58.737
For the welfare of a new europe.
Together, we create a better

08:58.739 --> 09:03.074
World for future generations.
This is a place of order

09:03.076 --> 09:06.011
And discipline. Do your work,

09:06.013 --> 09:09.047
And you shall be treated
accordingly.

09:09.049 --> 09:14.052
After the war, we shall assess
everyone based on his merits

09:14.054 --> 09:17.689
And reassign him.
-  <i>Frauen und kinder</i>...

09:17.691 --> 09:19.891
-  <i>Frauen und kinder</i>...

09:33.406 --> 09:35.407
- No. Wait, please!
Please!

09:35.409 --> 09:37.676
- Abraham, go!
- No!

09:39.445 --> 09:42.213
- Abraham! Leave him!

09:42.215 --> 09:44.783
- You want to die right now?
Let her go.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.552
- I have to protect her.
- And if you try,

09:47.554 --> 09:50.422
You'll be killed also.
You think she wants that?

09:53.960 --> 09:57.429
- You. And you. Over here.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.065
- Skills?

10:00.067 --> 10:02.534
- We are carpenters.

10:02.536 --> 10:05.837
(guard gives orders in german)

10:09.875 --> 10:14.312
- I have six weeks
as an apprentice.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.315
- This is how we live.

10:25.992 --> 10:29.427
- Time to get up!
- We made you breakfast in bed.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.663
I cooked.
- I did.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.633
- Making toast isn't cooking.
- Thanks, guys.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.968
- Okay, you two, slow down.
Mama doesn't feel good.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.304
- No, no, it's okay.
- Any better?

10:39.306 --> 10:42.607
- I'm fine. If you'd just
stop fussing.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.644
My throat is sore and I'm tired.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.646
Regis idiots aren't gonna know
what him 'em

10:47.648 --> 10:50.415
When I'm done with them.
- Yes, miss joan.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.318
Now, drink your tea.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.987
Ooh! Ok, ok, I got it!
- Shit!

10:57.757 --> 10:59.858
(coughing)

10:59.860 --> 11:03.161
- I wish you weren't sick, mom.

11:03.163 --> 11:07.232
- Yeah, me too.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.108
(high-pitched ringing)

11:26.352 --> 11:31.322
Neeva, I... I need some rest.
Thank you guys for breakfast.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.025
Neeva--

11:37.863 --> 11:41.299
- So now what?
I assume you have a plan.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.401
- Of course.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.905
I visit the next person
on the flight manifest.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.874
- And you kill everyone
on that list?

11:49.876 --> 11:51.876
- Remember: They are
no longer people.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.045
And to think they are
is very dangerous.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.383
This early in the infection
they're easier to kill.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.686
Now that I have recruited you,
perhaps at the next house,

12:01.688 --> 12:05.223
We find another person to help.
And maybe at the next, another.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.226
With 20 people, we can cover
10 victims apiece.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.729
- So that you can build
a little army?

12:10.731 --> 12:12.864
- If I can.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.767
- Well I need film of one
of the victims alive

12:15.769 --> 12:18.069
So that my bosses will know how
dangerous and violent they are.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.039
Who's next on the list?
- Ansel barber.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.843
- One of the survivors.
- He's probably turned by now.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.749
Here. It's a nail gun.
Modified it years ago.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.619
Loaded with silver nails.
Silver affects them,

12:34.621 --> 12:37.756
It can even kill them.
For my purposes, it weakens

12:37.758 --> 12:40.859
Them enough to allow me to get
close enough for a final blow.

12:43.095 --> 12:47.031
You think you're taking a risk
in trusting the word

12:47.033 --> 12:49.768
Of a stranger but I'm taking
the greater risk

12:49.770 --> 12:53.972
In trusting you. What we're
dealing with here is the fate

12:53.974 --> 12:58.243
Of the human race. So, I don't
expect you to believe that yet.

12:58.245 --> 13:03.081
You believe you're drafting me
into your cause but truth is,

13:03.083 --> 13:06.718
I'm drafting you into mine.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.456
Just to be clear - if, in your
attempt to film mr. Barber,

13:11.458 --> 13:17.228
He infects you, I will not
hesitate to release you.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.131
- Duly noted.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.469
How long have you
been doing this?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.704
- Long enough.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.247
Interesting vehicle here.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.518
- Oh yeah, esther?
I got her in the congo.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.454
- A long way to go
for a truck.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.423
- It was one of my first
assignments. We were dealing

13:45.425 --> 13:47.959
With an epidemic of human
african trypanosomiasis

13:47.961 --> 13:50.795
That was burning its way through
the orientale province.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.965
I had to get from my camp
to this village that'd been hit.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.936
I traded my rolex for it...

13:57.938 --> 14:00.538
Which was a gift from
my father-in-law

14:00.540 --> 14:04.042
Which was not ideal
for my marriage. Anyway, uh.

14:04.044 --> 14:07.345
She was beat to shit when
I got her. Would hardly run,

14:07.347 --> 14:13.718
But... Just fell in love
with her. Shipped her home,

14:13.720 --> 14:15.720
Restored her, I've been driving
her ever since.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.657
- It's very impractical -
driving on the wrong side

14:19.659 --> 14:22.327
Of the road.
Is there a heater in here?

14:22.329 --> 14:25.396
- I know. It just a reminder.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.066
We saved a lot
of lives back there.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.835
- So you're a romantic
and impractical.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.071
Wonderful.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.642
(dialing)

14:39.478 --> 14:41.412
- (answering machine): <i>This is</i>
<i>dr. Nora martinez. Leave me</i>

14:41.414 --> 14:43.481
<i>A message, and I'll get back</i>
<i>to you as soon as I can.</i>

14:43.483 --> 14:46.317
- Hey, nora. I know you don't
want to talk to me, but just...

14:46.319 --> 14:49.053
Just call me back to let me know
that you're ok.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.423
Please. Just... Just call me.
(beep!)

14:54.360 --> 14:57.562
- You two are close?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.565
- We're friends.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.735
- Nothing more?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.337
- What does it matter?

15:06.339 --> 15:12.543
- Those we hold dear...
If they are turned -

15:12.545 --> 15:16.080
They come back home and destroy
those they love the most.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.293
(growling)

15:39.805 --> 15:42.874
(snoring)

15:55.454 --> 15:57.822
(eating noises)

16:04.596 --> 16:07.165
(crack!)

16:14.673 --> 16:16.641
- Zajak died last night.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.010
Did you see the body?

16:19.012 --> 16:22.613
- I try not to look.
He was sick.

16:22.615 --> 16:26.651
- Not that sick.

16:28.754 --> 16:32.156
Something killed him.
- Being here killed him.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.425
- No, I saw something in
the bunkhouse last night.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.828
- What did you see?

16:38.697 --> 16:41.566
- I saw a creature.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.570
It was feeding on him.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.607
- Sounds like you had
a nightmare.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.011
- It was real.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.614
My <i>bubbeh</i> told me stories
when I was a child.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.685
Stories about a monster who fed
on the blood of men.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.554
She said the monster was drawn
to human misery.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.556
What place is more miserable
than this?

17:05.558 --> 17:09.227
- Well, that part I believe.
- She told me the only way

17:09.229 --> 17:12.530
To kill it was with silver.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.033
If we can get into the metal
shop where they are melting down

17:15.035 --> 17:17.135
The silver--
- stop. Now.

17:17.137 --> 17:20.304
Stop looking for monsters.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.408
We're already surrounded
by them.

17:25.677 --> 17:28.246
- <i>Weiter!</i>

17:41.660 --> 17:43.928
- You're lucky the bossman's
not in yet.

17:45.664 --> 17:49.233
- Small favors.
- He's pretty angry at you.

17:49.235 --> 17:53.037
That rich guy called.
Said you were rude.

17:53.039 --> 17:57.041
- You wonder why there's so many
rat calls lately?

17:57.043 --> 18:00.111
- Mmm... Nope.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.913
You know, I was getting on
the subway today and I did see

18:01.915 --> 18:05.883
Like, ten rats.
Like, on the platform.

18:05.885 --> 18:09.120
Yeah, and then they just ran up
the stairs and outta the station

18:09.122 --> 18:13.458
Ballsy as you please.
- Rats don't migrate like that.

18:13.460 --> 18:17.261
Unless they lose
their food source,

18:17.263 --> 18:19.797
Or something disturbs them.

18:19.799 --> 18:24.435
There's plenty of food
down there.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.904
Something is driving them out
of their nests.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.973
- Like what?

18:28.975 --> 18:31.976
- A bigger predator.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.645
Gah!
- Ah!

18:36.715 --> 18:38.983
Hey.
- Mmm?

18:38.985 --> 18:43.154
What about these calls?
- Give them to mitch.

18:47.893 --> 18:51.229
- (radio): <i>... The eclipse is</i>
<i>one of the most spectacular</i>

18:51.231 --> 18:53.731
<i>Astronomical events that most</i>
<i>new yorkers will ever witness,</i>

18:53.733 --> 18:56.801
<i>But viewing it will be</i>
<i>exceptionally dangerous.</i>

18:56.803 --> 18:59.303
<i>The massive occultation</i>
<i>of the sun will cause</i>

18:59.305 --> 19:01.639
<i>Permanent blindness,</i>
<i>macular damage,</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:04.942
<i>And thermal retinal burn.</i>
<i>Do not view this event directly</i>

19:04.944 --> 19:07.378
<i>Unless you take the proper</i>
<i>precautions...</i>

19:09.648 --> 19:12.350
(phone ringing)

19:14.453 --> 19:16.521
- Dr. Martinez.

19:16.523 --> 19:20.158
Yep-- cellphones haven't been
working.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.960
What? She did?

19:22.962 --> 19:26.030
I'll be right there.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.003
How'd you find her?
- Oh, she walked about six

19:32.005 --> 19:34.472
Blocks, went into a coffee shop,
and ordered a martini.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.175
Fortunately, she was wearing
her id bracelet.

19:37.177 --> 19:40.945
- There she is!
My beautiful daughter.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.980
-  <i>Hola, mama!</i>
<i>- Dr. Martinez...</i>

19:42.982 --> 19:46.384
This is her third incident.
- I understand, but please.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.787
She loves it here.
- I do not!

19:49.789 --> 19:52.156
- Mama, please.

19:52.158 --> 19:55.226
Why don't you go sit down.
I'll be right there.

20:00.232 --> 20:03.568
Please. She has friends here,
people here to talk to.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.970
- We would have to hire someone
to look after her,

20:05.972 --> 20:08.573
It would be... Expensive.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.808
- I'll pay for it.
(phone ringing)

20:10.810 --> 20:13.477
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.

20:31.396 --> 20:35.032
This is my daughter, nora.
She's in medical school.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.535
- Hello, I'm doris.
- Nice to meet you.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.570
So you're studying
to be a doctor?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.439
- Actually I'm already a doctor,

20:41.441 --> 20:44.375
I work for the centers for
disease control.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.611
- My nora is good girl.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.679
She came to help me pack.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.882
- I'm just here to visit, ma.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.919
- I want you to take me home.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.590
- You are home.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.496
- We gotta get her down.
- Wait.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.168
- What are you doing?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.073
- In a silver mirror,
if she's infected,

21:49.075 --> 21:51.742
Her reflection vibrates.
It's one of the signs

21:51.744 --> 21:55.313
Of the <i>strigoi</i> .
- Really?

21:57.683 --> 22:01.519
- Help me with her.
- We have other priorities.

22:09.461 --> 22:13.497
- Here we go. She left
the children with his sister.

22:13.499 --> 22:17.468
"I am so sorry, ansel...

22:17.470 --> 22:21.038
"I can't bear to face this world
without you.

22:22.974 --> 22:27.878
"forgive me... Forgive me...."

22:45.130 --> 22:48.232
(chains rustling)

22:59.511 --> 23:02.980
(banging inside shed.)
(beep!)

23:13.525 --> 23:17.928
- Be careful. Do whatever you
can to avoid the blood.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.731
One worm... Is all it takes.

23:39.384 --> 23:42.086
(clunk! Clink!)

23:57.702 --> 24:00.204
(heavy panting)

24:03.875 --> 24:06.210
- Raah!!

24:06.212 --> 24:08.412
- Did she chain him up in here?

24:08.414 --> 24:11.148
- He chained himself.
To spare his family.

24:11.150 --> 24:14.118
It makes our job easier.
Use the nail gun!

24:14.120 --> 24:16.086
Stun the strigoi!

24:16.088 --> 24:18.989
(squealing)
<i>sabia...</i>

24:18.991 --> 24:22.293
<i>Mea fredoneaza de argint.</i>

24:28.900 --> 24:32.369
Avoid contact with the worms.
Don't touch the blood.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.373
- Guh. Gg--

24:50.322 --> 24:54.425
<i>Stun the strigoi!</i>
<i>- Good enough.</i>

24:59.865 --> 25:03.334
- (ansel): <i>Rahhh!</i>
<i>(squealing from video.)</i>

25:15.213 --> 25:20.017
- Do you believe it now, doctor?
The evil we're facing?

25:39.037 --> 25:41.705
- Rrrr...

25:47.846 --> 25:51.615
- Ghh-- hgg!

25:53.985 --> 25:57.588
Hgh-- hh.

26:03.595 --> 26:06.897
- Unh.
(crack!)

26:13.572 --> 26:17.274
- Nora, just... Call me back.
Please.

26:17.276 --> 26:20.945
I need to know you're safe.
(beep!)

26:20.947 --> 26:24.515
- We must leave. Good luck
with your video, doctor.

26:24.517 --> 26:28.018
- Come with me. Help me get
this quarantine declared.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.722
- You must do what you think
is right, as must I.

26:31.724 --> 26:36.627
I hope you succeed and prove me
wrong. Until then, well...

26:36.629 --> 26:40.431
I know my cause seems hopeless,
but I have seen what happens

26:40.433 --> 26:42.700
When people stand by
and do nothing.

26:44.469 --> 26:48.238
Inaction is the greatest evil.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.108
We both have work to do.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.152
- Please...

27:02.154 --> 27:04.855
Stay with me.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.327
Was I speaking?

27:10.329 --> 27:13.230
- No, sir.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.807
- How am I, doctor?

27:23.809 --> 27:27.077
- Surgery was a success.
Of course, it's too early to say

27:27.079 --> 27:30.147
If there will be
any rejection issues.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.517
- Is there something else
on your mind, doctor?

27:33.519 --> 27:37.988
- It's a fact now, eldritch.
Your body cannot endure

27:37.990 --> 27:40.290
The trauma of another major
operation.

27:40.292 --> 27:45.362
And if the ama gets wind
of this organ harvesting...

27:45.364 --> 27:48.632
- I won't require you
to operate on me again.

27:48.634 --> 27:52.770
The fee you collect for this
procedure will be your last.

27:52.772 --> 27:57.941
- Thank you for understanding.
It isn't always up to us.

27:57.943 --> 28:03.947
- Of course it isn't.
One must rely on a higher power.

29:20.892 --> 29:23.427
(door creaks)

29:25.029 --> 29:28.232
- Mr. Bolivar.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.634
Never sneak up on a working man
like that.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.303
I'm jack noon.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.606
Your manager requested

29:35.608 --> 29:37.875
That I come and do
a little tidying up.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.910
So, you just back off
for a while

29:39.912 --> 29:44.181
And I'm gonna make sure
this never happened.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.623
Ah, some blood.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.758
It's not a big...

29:54.760 --> 29:56.994
Messy...

29:56.996 --> 30:01.565
Disaster like I've seen. So.

30:02.834 --> 30:06.503
Cell phone triangulation
and gps places her here.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.173
We'll just deposit that
on the street.

30:09.175 --> 30:14.578
Now your story is, she arrived,
she administered to you,

30:14.580 --> 30:16.914
And then she mentioned
that she was feeling

30:16.916 --> 30:21.351
A bit under the weather
and then she left soon after.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.254
But for right now,
the less you know the better.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.357
I'm going to have to insist
that you back up.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.863
Ok? Keep some space. I'll be
out of your hair in no time.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.833
<i>Comprende</i> ?
- Rrah!

30:40.004 --> 30:43.073
- That was a serious mistake,
dude. Don't make another.

30:52.283 --> 30:54.318
Fff.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.754
Now who's gonna pay me?

31:01.860 --> 31:05.429
What--
(piercing cry)

31:08.900 --> 31:11.201
Hh---

31:29.554 --> 31:32.656
- I don't know how many times
I have to tell you, I'm fine.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.828
- You need a doctor, miss joan.
- No, I need fresh air.

31:37.830 --> 31:40.664
Not more goddamn tea.
A run's gonna clear this up.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.933
- No, I don't think that's
a good idea.

31:42.935 --> 31:45.602
- I don't think I asked you.
Oh god!

31:45.604 --> 31:48.338
- What's the matter? What? What!
- There's something in my eye.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.276
Do you see it?

31:52.278 --> 31:55.145
What is it?

31:57.448 --> 31:59.416
- Nothing.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.252
- Ok, that's super helpful.
(sighs)

32:22.540 --> 32:25.142
- Where are we going?
Are we going into the city?

32:25.144 --> 32:28.946
- Uh, mama needs some rest,
so we are going on an adventure.

32:28.948 --> 32:31.782
Whoever is the first one out
the door gets a prize.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.686
- Neeva!

32:43.928 --> 32:46.063
- Uh, I was taking the children
to a movie.

32:46.065 --> 32:49.800
- Yes!

33:03.281 --> 33:06.249
(high-pitched static)
(thumping)

33:16.594 --> 33:18.996
- We will back in a few hours.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.935
- Fine. Just not too late,
neeva.

33:24.937 --> 33:27.170
- No, of course not.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.617
(beep! Beep! Beep!)

34:40.011 --> 34:43.280
(squeals of rats)

35:02.266 --> 35:05.502
(low growling)

35:11.876 --> 35:14.111
- Rrrggghh...

35:31.229 --> 35:33.563
(the <i>strigoi</i> screech and growl.)

35:52.083 --> 35:54.985
(squealing)

35:57.655 --> 36:00.924
- Remember how I used to braid
your hair for school?

36:00.926 --> 36:03.860
- Every day.
- Appearances matter, nora.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.963
- I know, ma.
- I'm sorry I have to work

36:06.965 --> 36:10.834
So much. It's just so hard
with your father gone...

36:10.836 --> 36:14.271
When are we going home?

36:14.273 --> 36:16.907
- You are home.

36:18.342 --> 36:23.647
- This is not my home.
I don't know these people.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.682
You force me to live
with strangers.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.119
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry you
have to stay here.

36:29.121 --> 36:33.056
- Why? You always say stay,
but you never say why.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.525
- Please! Please. Don't do this
to me right now...

36:37.328 --> 36:41.064
- Â¿ <i>que te pasa</i> ?

36:41.066 --> 36:43.333
Tell me what's wrong.
Let me help.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.636
Tell me.
- Something bad happened.

36:46.638 --> 36:51.374
At work. We're working on
this case and...

36:51.376 --> 36:54.211
I don't think I can do
what needs to be done.

36:54.213 --> 36:58.081
- You'll figure it out,
my smart girl.

36:58.083 --> 37:03.653
Why do you think I did what
I did to put you through school?

37:03.655 --> 37:09.659
Because I always knew you could
conquer anything in this world.

37:16.867 --> 37:20.503
I don't want to go back to
my room and this isn't my home.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.939
- I'll lie down with you until
you fall asleep.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.343
Just like we used to.
- Rr-- raah!

37:26.345 --> 37:28.778
- What's going on?

37:28.780 --> 37:31.181
(the <i>strigoi</i> growls
and screeches.)

37:31.183 --> 37:33.750
- Hey, what are you doing?

37:38.122 --> 37:39.923
- We have to go, come on!

37:41.592 --> 37:43.860
- Nora, stop!
- We can't!

37:43.862 --> 37:47.897
- Nora, where are we going?
- Home, ma. We're going home.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.600
(police sirens)

38:07.218 --> 38:10.720
- Everett! You and the secretary
wanted proof? Here it is.

38:10.722 --> 38:14.758
- Eph. What are you doing here?
- I'm doing my job.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.494
- I've been following the spread
of this disease. And believe me,

38:17.496 --> 38:20.163
It is a disease. I have video
documenting the physical effects

38:20.165 --> 38:22.799
Of this infection. I also have
video of an infected person in

38:22.801 --> 38:25.602
The full throes of the illness.
Everett, this is moving fast.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.637
- What is it you want?
- What do you mean, what do

38:27.639 --> 38:30.507
I want? I want a broad
quarantine. We need to lock down

38:30.509 --> 38:32.742
Anyone related to the plane
casualties.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.944
- You want to lock down
relatives of dead passengers?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.681
- They're not dead.

38:37.683 --> 38:41.618
They're dormant but infected,
and at a certain point

38:41.620 --> 38:45.655
They all wake up. It's like...

38:45.657 --> 38:50.527
It's like a caterpillar turning
into a butterfly.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.199
The look dead, but... They're
undergoing a metamorphosis.

38:56.201 --> 39:00.003
And when they come out the other
side, they are something

39:00.005 --> 39:02.806
Completely different.
- So you found the bodies?

39:02.808 --> 39:05.175
- No. But I-- I know where
they are, generally...

39:05.177 --> 39:09.279
I performed the autopsy
on captain redfern.

39:09.281 --> 39:14.384
I also have empirical proof that
the victims are returning home

39:14.386 --> 39:17.721
And infecting their families.
I saw gary arnot,

39:17.723 --> 39:22.158
Emma arnot's father.
He was infected. By emma.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.327
- Eph, this is...
- I know it's hard to fathom.

39:24.329 --> 39:27.364
But if we can just contain this
in this next level,

39:27.366 --> 39:31.401
This family level, we might have
a chance to beat this.

39:31.403 --> 39:35.338
I need you to do this,
everett. Please.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.640
- Everybody above me
would be against this.

39:37.642 --> 39:40.076
I would have to move mountains.
- And if you did, you'd be

39:40.078 --> 39:42.078
The man who beat this plague,
wouldn't you, everett?

39:42.080 --> 39:47.884
You'd be right up there
with pasteur, salk...

39:47.886 --> 39:50.920
This event - it's that big.

39:54.024 --> 39:57.727
Please...

39:57.729 --> 40:01.364
Just look at the video.

40:01.366 --> 40:05.935
Once you see the proof,
you'll know it's the right call.

40:07.371 --> 40:09.372
(growling from video)

40:09.374 --> 40:12.609
- (ansel): <i>Raah!!</i>

40:12.611 --> 40:15.211
- (setrakian): <i>... To spare his</i>
<i>family. Makes our job</i>

40:15.213 --> 40:18.515
<i>...Easier. Use the nail gun!</i>
<i>Stun the strigoi!</i>

40:18.517 --> 40:21.451
(shots fired)
(ansel squeals and screeches.)

40:21.453 --> 40:25.789
- (setrakian): <i>Sabia mea</i>
<i>fredoneaza de argint.</i>

40:25.791 --> 40:27.924
- Hang on. I'm gonna cancel
my next appointment.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.860
- Thank you.

40:36.634 --> 40:40.603
- It's spreading?
- Massively.

40:44.942 --> 40:48.578
- (muffled): ... Right now.
Deny it.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.580
- He's not cancelling
his meeting, is he?

40:50.582 --> 40:54.150
- They have you on video
dragging redfern's body

40:54.152 --> 40:56.486
Down the hallway
in the basement.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.988
- I have to get out of here.

41:07.097 --> 41:09.833
He shut down my card.
- Not mine.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.126
- Eph, I'm sorry. I had no idea
that this was gonna happen--

41:37.128 --> 41:39.128
- You want to do the right
thing? Get barnes to declare

41:39.130 --> 41:41.130
That quarantine.
Get every passenger

41:41.132 --> 41:43.566
And their family members
in our control.

41:45.603 --> 41:49.439
- Eph... Drop your phone.
I'll see what I can do.

41:52.877 --> 41:55.478
- I'm trying to email myself
these files.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.614
- The internet is all
screwed up. You gotta drop it.

41:57.616 --> 42:01.017
They can trace you.
- This is my evidence. I can't.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.152
They can't trace me without
the sim card, right?

42:03.154 --> 42:05.622
Gimme a paperclip.

42:21.505 --> 42:23.406
- Eph!

42:23.408 --> 42:26.709
Take this.

42:26.711 --> 42:30.313
Look, whatever I did,
I never did it to betray you.

42:30.315 --> 42:33.249
- You wanna be helpful?
Do your job.
