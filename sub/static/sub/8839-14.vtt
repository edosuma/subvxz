I GOT US SOME GOOD NEWS.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.306
I THINK THERE'S A WAY
TO GET THAT MILL OPEN
AFTER ALL.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.557
HEY, HOW'S THAT?

01:40.725 --> 01:41.892

01:50.568 --> 01:52.069

CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.533
WE'LL HAVE MORE
THAN ENOUGH MONEY

01:57.700 --> 02:00.911
FOR THE NEW GRINDING GEARS
AND THE NEW GRINDING WHEEL.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.413

02:03.581 --> 02:06.250

WE'D GO FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.419
TOMORROW? I GOT TO GET
THAT ROOF FIXED.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.256
I--I GOT A WHOLE CORN FIELD
NEEDS HARVESTING.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.216
CHARLES, YOU CAN'T
TURN THIS DOWN.

02:14.384 --> 02:18.470
THAT'S $50.
FOR THE TWO OF US,
THAT'S $100 CASH MONEY.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.100

02:30.608 --> 02:32.609
NO, YOU GO AHEAD
AND KEEP IT.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.153
Charles: RIGHT.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.617

02:58.469 --> 02:59.678
YEAH, HE JUST
STOPPED BY.

02:59.846 --> 03:00.971
WHAT DID HE WANT?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.472
OH, IT WAS NOTHING.
HE WAS JUST TALKING

03:02.640 --> 03:05.184
ABOUT SOME NEW
TELEPHONE LINES
THAT WERE GOING IN.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.602
OH.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.936

03:13.610 --> 03:15.444
GOING TO MAKE $50.
PRETTY GOOD WAGE.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.280
HMM.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.490
I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.910
WOULD YOU BE
HAPPY FOR US?

03:23.077 --> 03:24.453
OH, CHARLES...

03:24.621 --> 03:25.787
NOW, CAROLINE,
LISTEN TO ME.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.664
IT WOULD BE ONLY
FOR A MONTH, 30 DAYS.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.625
IN 30 DAYS,
I'D MAKE $50.

03:29.792 --> 03:30.959
Charles: NOW, WITH
THAT KIND OF MONEY,

03:31.127 --> 03:32.961
JONATHAN AND I COULD FIX
UP THAT MILL LIKE NEW.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.548
CHARLES, WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO EAT. WE HAVE A ROOF
OVER OUR HEADS. THERE'S--

03:36.716 --> 03:39.593
CAROLINE, DON'T
MAKE THIS HARDER ON ME
THAN IT IS ALREADY.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.346
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE HARD ON YOU?

03:42.513 --> 03:45.682
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK
IT'S HARD ON ME?

03:49.437 --> 03:50.854
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MA?

03:52.357 --> 03:54.608
I SAID SOMETHING
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.737
YOU CHILDREN START
SUPPER WITHOUT ME,
ALL RIGHT?

04:33.648 --> 04:35.899
I'M SORRY
YOU KNOW.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.150
IT WAS A STUPID
THING TO SAY.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.111
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I SAID IT FOR.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.783
HEY, I'M SORRY.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.580
IT'S JUST--

04:52.208 --> 04:55.043
IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN YOU'RE AWAY,

04:55.211 --> 04:57.546
I GET SO TIRED AND...

04:59.340 --> 05:01.717
AT NIGHT, I'M...

05:01.884 --> 05:02.926
LONELY.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.804
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.264
LOOK, I WON'T GO.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.183
I'LL TELL JONATHAN
WHEN HE COMES
TOMORROW MORNING.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.393
YOU WILL?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.686
OF COURSE I WILL.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.563
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU FEEL BETTER?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.231
OKAY.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.945
YOU CAN GO.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.238
BUT YOU
JUST SAID--

05:23.406 --> 05:24.781
I KNOW WHAT I SAID,

05:24.949 --> 05:27.159
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW
THAT YOU'D GIVE IT UP,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.494
YOU CAN GO.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.622
NOW THAT YOU KNOW
I'D GIVE IT UP,
I CAN GO.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.000
CAROLINE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.294
I KNOW.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.171
TIME FOR SUPPER.

05:42.633 --> 05:46.094
NOW, I CAN GO.
BEFORE, I COULDN'T GO.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.637
I DON'T KNOW.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.319
I JUST NEVER GET
USED TO THE IDEA
OF YOU BEING AWAY.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.653
ME NEITHER.

06:03.821 --> 06:04.946
AS HARD AS YOU'LL
ALL BE WORKING,

06:05.114 --> 06:07.783
A MONTH WILL
GO BY FAST.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.160
BESIDES, YOU KNOW,
THIS JOB IS MORE
THAN JUST THE MONEY.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.870
WE'RE GOING TO BE
KIND OF A LITTLE
PART OF HISTORY

06:12.038 --> 06:13.330
HELPING TO PUT
THAT LINE IN.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.084
CAN YOU REALLY
TALK TO SOMEBODY
A HUNDRED MILES AWAY?

06:17.251 --> 06:18.335
MM-HMM.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.503
FURTHER THAN THAT.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.004
LOOK, IT SAYS
RIGHT HERE.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.799
IT SAYS, "THE FIRST
INTERSTATE TELEPHONE
CALL WAS MADE

06:23.966 --> 06:26.843

YOU ABOUT A FAMILY

IN THEIR HOUSE.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.809
HUH. IT'S HARD
TO IMAGINE.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.770
I WONDER WHAT'S LIKE
TALKING TO PEOPLE
SO FAR AWAY.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.980

READ ME FAIRY

06:42.652 --> 06:44.027
OH, SOMEBODY WILL.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.530

BE THE SAME.

JUST AS GOOD AS I CAN.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.204
CAN NOT.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.915

TO MAKE UP FOR THE MONTH
THAT I'M GONE,

06:57.083 --> 07:00.210
I'LL READ YOU AN EXTRA
LONG ONE TONIGHT.
HOW'S THAT?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.504
WILL YOU READ IT
TO ME NOW?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.214
CAN I HELP YOU
WITH THE WASH?

29:19.382 --> 29:21.300
IF YOU LIKE.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.805
I HAD A DREAM,
YESTERDAY.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.557
OH?

29:28.725 --> 29:29.892
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

29:30.059 --> 29:33.270
HA, DREAMS ARE FUN.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.565
IT GOT BAD
AT THE END.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.233
A BUG WAS GOING
TO KILL ME.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.402
OH, CARRIE, HOW
COULD A BUG KILL YOU?

29:40.570 --> 29:42.738
THIS ONE COULD.
IT WAS AS BIG AS ME.

29:42.906 --> 29:43.906
[LAUGHS]

29:44.073 --> 29:45.741
WELL, DREAMS
ARE LIKE THAT--

29:45.909 --> 29:48.076
SOME GOOD, SOME BAD.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.163
I HAD A FRIEND
IN MY DREAM.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.915
SHE LOOKED
JUST LIKE ME.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.459
Caroline:
SHE MUST'VE BEEN
PRETTY, THEN.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.377
SHE WAS.

29:57.545 --> 30:00.088
SHE HAD A CROWN
OF FLOWERS

30:00.256 --> 30:02.925
AND A BEAUTIFUL
DRESS,

30:03.092 --> 30:04.802
AND--
AND SHE TOOK ME

30:04.969 --> 30:07.721
TO WHERE BERRIES
ARE AS BIG AS ME,

30:07.889 --> 30:09.765
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS
MY GODSISTER.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.268
OH, CARRIE,
NO!

30:13.436 --> 30:14.353
OH!

30:14.521 --> 30:16.563
