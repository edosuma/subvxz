00:18.018 --> 00:19.728
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.232
They want us to move into fentanyl.
It's like heroin.

00:22.315 --> 00:24.942
- Where you gonna make it?
- You're standing in it.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.695
<i>Those twins,
they kidnapped my nephew.</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:29.405
I want Reggie back alive.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.033
I want 5 million from the drugs you stole.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.827
I have 30 seconds. You gotta help me.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.745
- My son's been kidnapped.
- What?

00:35.828 --> 00:37.288
This is not what I signed up for.

00:37.372 --> 00:41.083
What would you have done if someone
kidnapped your brothers, Bobby, Twix, Wes?

00:41.167 --> 00:44.503
You see what this animal is doing to us?
This is not what family does.

00:44.587 --> 00:47.298
I'm not putting this gun down
until you tell me where Reggie is.

00:47.382 --> 00:48.842
Do what you think is right.

00:48.925 --> 00:50.760
<i>Why aren't we going to the church?</i>

00:50.843 --> 00:53.680
Because those two Italian freaks
sent people there, Nats.

00:53.763 --> 00:55.140
You think I'm gonna forget this?

00:55.223 --> 00:58.058
<i>You should.
This was me and you fixing their mess.</i>

00:59.185 --> 01:01.645
<i>He had a gun on him.
They say that's intent.</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:03.732
They're charging him
with second-degree murder.

01:03.815 --> 01:06.818
You sent him alone to punish him.
It worked.

01:06.902 --> 01:08.737
<i>Is he in jail because of me?</i>

01:08.820 --> 01:11.197
Nats told me not to call the cops.
I should've listened.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.075
<i>My employer sent me to remind you</i>

01:14.158 --> 01:17.287
that our payment deadline
is still the same date.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.748
I'll be around just to make sure
that you stick to our agreement.

01:28.965 --> 01:31.758
<i>In this business,
no transaction would even happen</i>

01:31.843 --> 01:34.803

of it not happening.</i>

01:57.410 --> 01:59.328
<i>- Do you have our money?</i>
- I do.

01:59.412 --> 02:02.332
Good. I will send the container
and the crate numbers.

02:02.415 --> 02:04.833
Place them as instructed
before the ship leaves.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.212
What if someone finds it on the way?

02:07.295 --> 02:09.547
Don't worry.
We have people in the boat to keep watch.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.382

- No.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.803

Don't mess it up.

02:15.887 --> 02:18.515
<i>♪ It's got to be the way it is ♪</i>

02:55.468 --> 02:57.428
Well, ribs take a while to heal.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.972
Should I get an X-ray?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.765
No, they're probably cracked,

03:01.848 --> 03:03.977
and then there's nothing
you can do about that.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.437
Does it hurt anywhere else?

03:05.520 --> 03:08.940
Yeah, well, whole head, my face.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.858
Well, you are in good spirits,
considering.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.235
You're a good nurse.

03:14.237 --> 03:17.157
In this moment, everything's...

03:17.240 --> 03:18.950
...perfect.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.327
Hi, Reggie. Come on.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.453
I gotta do this thing.
I want you to come with me.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.873
He should probably rest.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.542
I don't want you out of my sight.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.378
- Where are we going?
- The port. Won't be long.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.300
- Maybe he should stay.
- No, no, no.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.385
The sea air will do me good.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.845
It's a river. It's full of piss and oil.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.973
Well, the last time you left me alone,

03:43.057 --> 03:44.392
things didn't go so good.

03:46.937 --> 03:49.105
So, yeah, I'm coming with you.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.068
Stay at my side. Stay quiet.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.868
<i>The hard work was done.
I had the cartel's payment.</i>

04:03.703 --> 04:05.383
<i>Now, it's not the way I planned to get it.</i>

04:05.413 --> 04:08.165
<i>But they don't care.
They just want their money.</i>

04:08.958 --> 04:10.125
<i>And in a few hours,</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:12.128
<i>the cash would be sailing
on the cargo ship</i>

04:12.212 --> 04:15.632
<i>and I would be right back
where I needed to be.</i>

04:23.097 --> 04:24.515
We all set?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.102
All good. Tape, locks.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.728
Yeah.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.605
Leave your car here. I'll walk you in.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.450
I've got an idea.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.618
I was thinking maybe
you could talk to Nats,

04:44.702 --> 04:47.497
you know, make a deal,
and he could tell you stuff.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.500
And then it'll be OK. We'll be OK.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.002
Whoa, what do you mean?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.212
We gotta get him out.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.130
He can't stay inside. That's ridiculous!

04:56.213 --> 04:59.050
I need him. I mean, he's my baby's father.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.258
I can't do it by myself.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.677
- OK.
- I need your help.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.595
- Val...
- I've been giving you my help.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.973
I've been helping you,
and you gotta help me.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.975
Nats killed an innocent civilian.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.935
- I'm telling you...
- I can't help with that!

05:10.018 --> 05:11.103
Listen, listen, listen!

05:11.187 --> 05:13.605
I'm saying, what if

05:13.690 --> 05:15.400
he tells you, you know,

05:15.483 --> 05:17.652
stuff about the family,
about the business?

05:17.735 --> 05:19.570
That'd be great, but even if he did,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.363
I can't cut a deal for his murder charge.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.742
You can! That's bullshit!
Yes, you can. There's a way.

05:23.825 --> 05:26.035
There's always a way. Have you see...

05:26.118 --> 05:28.287
Listen, you talk to a judge, something.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.205
I don't know! I want my husband back!

05:30.288 --> 05:32.875
Let's back it up. What do you have for me?

05:34.585 --> 05:36.212
What? What? What?

05:36.295 --> 05:37.963
Have you heard anything new?

05:38.047 --> 05:40.425
Maybe you overheard
Enzo or Domenic talking.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.093
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

05:43.177 --> 05:45.178
I'm not here

05:45.262 --> 05:47.765
to give you sweet nothing.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.100
You understand?

05:49.183 --> 05:51.310
It is your turn to give something to me.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.020
Nats doesn't deserve this.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.273
This, this monster kidnapped my son.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.025
He took my baby.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.405
Nats was being a father. I didn't help.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.573
You didn't help,
you didn't help, nobody helped.

06:04.657 --> 06:07.910
Nats was the only one who did something.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.995
He was trying to get this son of a bitch!

06:10.078 --> 06:12.038
Nats isn't in prison

06:12.123 --> 06:15.710
because of something you did
or I did or even Declan did.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.755
He's in prison
because this is what happens to criminals.

06:18.838 --> 06:20.673
No one's kidnapping
the kid of the librarian

06:20.757 --> 06:23.885
or the nurse who lives down the street,
just the kids of gangsters!

06:25.887 --> 06:27.430
I'm not telling you shit.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.265
OK, look,
I don't wanna go over this again.

06:29.348 --> 06:32.185
If Nats or Domenic find out
that you've been talking to me...

06:32.268 --> 06:34.020
You wouldn't dare.

06:34.103 --> 06:37.148
Just because Nats is on the inside
doesn't mean our relationship ends.

06:37.232 --> 06:40.735
Your information is what gives you worth,

06:40.818 --> 06:42.820
so get him to talk.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.990
We're done!

07:00.672 --> 07:02.548
What are we doing here?

07:02.632 --> 07:04.550
Gotta deliver this bag to someone.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.137
This will only take a few minutes,
in and out.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.682
Who's the money for?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.102
Reggie, let's just do this.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.605
It's not like I don't know what you do.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.203
Hey. There it is.

07:33.955 --> 07:36.623
Get those red-handle lock cutters.
This bag's going to Mexico.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.250
We're breaking into this thing?

07:38.333 --> 07:40.168
See this tape?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.172
Each one of these containers, Reggie,

07:42.255 --> 07:44.173
is checked by customs.

07:44.257 --> 07:46.175
They tape it up, lock it up,

07:46.258 --> 07:47.968
so that when it gets to where it's going,

07:48.052 --> 07:49.470
those people on the other side,

07:49.553 --> 07:51.472
they notice it hasn't been tampered with.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.685
Yeah, unless you got
more tape and more locks.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.985
277, this is the one.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.318
- Reg.
- Huh?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.028
Lift this with me. Come on, lift.

08:20.585 --> 08:21.793
Hey, guys. What's up?

08:21.877 --> 08:24.588
We've been tasked with a random search
of these here docks.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.882
You're kidding me!
No one told me about that.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.968
Hence the defining characteristic
of "random".

08:30.887 --> 08:33.972
I think I got this.
Money's going to Mexico.

08:34.057 --> 08:35.975
You must got a guy on the other side

08:36.058 --> 08:38.268
who'll get it before
customs even touches it, right?

08:38.352 --> 08:39.352
Right.

08:39.437 --> 08:40.938
But hiding it with baby stuff,

08:41.022 --> 08:43.648
that is the first place
that I would look for drugs or...

08:43.732 --> 08:45.400
Look at that one, DVD players.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.278
That's full of drugs.
Who buys DVD players anymore?

08:48.362 --> 08:49.447
I do!

08:55.410 --> 08:57.580
- Is that bad?
- Nah, it's alright.

09:00.792 --> 09:03.377
So, these containers
were just filled with merchandise.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.005
Why don't you come here
and lift stuff all the time?

09:07.088 --> 09:08.757
Because I'm not a thief,

09:08.840 --> 09:11.843
- and I'm done with baby seats.
- Right, of course.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.239
<i>I got a boat
that's leaving in three hours.</i>

09:15.263 --> 09:18.142
You know what kind of disaster
it'll be if it doesn't go out?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.560
No, I don't. We're gonna round up
everyone on these docks

09:20.645 --> 09:23.022
and cross-reference them
with the union list we got.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.065
Anyone not on that list,
we're bringing 'em in.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.693
Do you have any idea
how long that's gonna take?

09:27.777 --> 09:30.070
Long enough to get me to overtime.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.363
Let's go!

09:35.492 --> 09:36.785
Open it up.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.792
What are you doing?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.377
I got this new coffee maker.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.585
I'm trying to set the timer

09:45.670 --> 09:48.047
so that when I wake up,
the coffee's already made.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.609
- Make it when you wake up.
- I'd like it ready when I wake up.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.468
You can't wait five minutes for a coffee?

09:52.552 --> 09:55.095
I can, but I would rather not.
What's your problem?

09:55.178 --> 09:56.930
My son's in prison!

09:59.017 --> 10:00.183
Ah, I'm sorry.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.977
Oh, I can't sleep.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.813
What you're going through,
nobody should have to suffer.

10:04.897 --> 10:06.107
You want a hug?

10:06.190 --> 10:07.400
Kiss my ass!

10:07.483 --> 10:08.985
Come on.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.820
- Hey.
- It's gonna be OK.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.363
Sorry I'm late.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.240
Hey.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.160
- How's Nats?
- You know. You know.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.122
- Yeah.
- Hey.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.915
I'd offer you a coffee,

10:22.998 --> 10:24.875
except I have no idea
how this machine works.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.002
Sit down.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.715
We wanna talk to you
about the fentanyl business.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.425
Pa, you know what I think.

10:32.508 --> 10:34.218
I don't wanna deal with this right now.

10:34.302 --> 10:35.552
I feel the same.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.972
I can't be in the same room
as the two of them right now.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.973
But we gotta work with 'em.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.727
Now, I know you think
this is a good business opportunity,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.313
which is why I decided
you're gonna be the one in charge.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.982
I want you to get distribution
up and running.

10:49.067 --> 10:50.777
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.362
Now, listen to me.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.613
You gotta be smart here, Luca.
You understand me?

10:55.698 --> 10:58.700
You gotta make sure these two
don't bring any trouble on this family.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.995
- And you tell us everything!
- Of course.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.080
I hate those two
for what they did to Nats.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.875
He's locked up cos of them.
But they want us to do this.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.877
I'm telling you,
it'll bring us a ton of money,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.712
and better we control from the start.

11:09.795 --> 11:13.507
Speaking of pineapples,
they wanna meet at the church.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.300
You call me right after.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.927
I got this.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.637
Yeah, thank you, Pa.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.223
Don't worry. You can trust me.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.392
Just be smart.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.607
Let's go for coffees.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.820
OK, but then I gotta get to church,
a real one.

11:36.072 --> 11:38.323
I'm putting in extra time.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.950
We need all the help we can get.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.162
Hang on, hang on.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.832
Yeah?

11:45.915 --> 11:47.851
<i>The cops are here doing a random search.</i>

11:47.875 --> 11:49.293
Well, shut it down!

11:49.960 --> 11:52.378
I can't.
I've never seen these guys before.

11:52.463 --> 11:53.463
I got no sway with them.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.340
<i>- So, what do we do?
- </i> Just don't move.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.343
<i>Stay on the boat.
I'll try to keep them off of it.</i>

11:58.427 --> 12:00.345
I'll call you when I know more.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.015
OK, we gotta pick it up.
Baby seat, let's go.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.977
- What's up?
- Let's go, let's go!

12:07.562 --> 12:09.272
Gotta move. Gotta clean this all up.

12:09.355 --> 12:11.523
Good, hand it to me. Good, good!

12:14.110 --> 12:17.905
Dissolve ENPP into pyridine and stir.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.448
At room temperature,
we add propionyl chloride...

12:21.533 --> 12:22.910
and stir for one hour.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.078
We pour that mixture into water,

12:25.162 --> 12:27.457
evaporate the solvent under vacuum until...

12:27.540 --> 12:29.583
Wait a second. Why am I watching all this?

12:29.667 --> 12:31.835
You should know everything
about your business.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.087
You think I'm gonna be making the drugs?

12:35.463 --> 12:37.173
What's so funny?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.050
The process of making fentanyl

12:39.135 --> 12:41.762
is highly complicated, very delicate.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.097
Right, yeah, so it would be ridiculous

12:44.182 --> 12:46.600
for someone like me
to even think about making this.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.768
Yes.

12:47.852 --> 12:49.645
Well, great!

12:49.728 --> 12:51.022
Can we go now?

12:51.105 --> 12:52.982
Cos this is boring me to death, really!

12:53.065 --> 12:55.108
Time management, folks!

12:55.943 --> 12:58.320
<i>Andiamo! </i> Time to go!

13:18.882 --> 13:20.425
If you're not serious about this,

13:20.508 --> 13:22.845
we can speak to Domenic
and find someone else.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.095
No, I'm serious.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.642
OK, Luca.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.643
So, it's your turn.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.603
- We want to know your plan.
- My plan?

13:32.855 --> 13:36.775
Unlike you, we like to know
everything about our businesses.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.237
So, tell us, how are you going to manage?

13:39.320 --> 13:42.173
Like I told you from the beginning,
you don't need to worry. I got it covered.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.990
OK. Well, show us.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.203
My distribution network?

13:48.287 --> 13:49.997
Exactly.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.873
We want to see how it all works.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.043
Up close.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.588
You want it, you got it.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.008
Let's go.

14:39.422 --> 14:41.090
Good. Let's go.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.347
Thank you.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.562
Put it on in the middle.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.355
Come on, let's move.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.862
Come on, this way. We gotta go this way.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.447
We're gonna lay low for a minute.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.532
We're gonna lay low.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.585
Hey, <i>bella!</i>

15:19.337 --> 15:21.088
How's the baby? Good?

15:21.172 --> 15:22.338
Good!

15:23.215 --> 15:24.925
Serena, <i>bella bambina!</i>

15:25.008 --> 15:27.343
Why are we here?

15:27.427 --> 15:28.887
What is he doing?

15:29.597 --> 15:33.350
I'll, uh, give you a call sometime, OK?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.435
See you guys later, OK?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.188
Why are we placing any of our business

15:39.272 --> 15:41.317
in the hands of this donkey?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.402
I think he'll surprise us.

15:43.485 --> 15:47.155
My sister, always the optimist.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.618
- Well?
- Well, what?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.245
That is your distribution empire?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.705
One of them.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.042
See the one in the black sweater?
That's Marie.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.918
She's my cousin,
which would make her your family too.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.463
Donna's also a cousin,
by marriage, though.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.048
Then there's Serena.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.425
I've known her since I was about 14.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.428
She took my virginity.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.560
A distribution empire
formed with family and prom dates.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.312
What could go wrong?

16:18.395 --> 16:19.772
And how exactly

16:19.855 --> 16:22.190
are you going to move
a kilo of drugs per week?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.360
Marie. There's a nurse.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.405
She's got a side business
going on worth 50K a week.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.158
Donna's a teacher.
Her husband works in a local college.

16:31.242 --> 16:33.743
Together, they run a string of dealers
in the schools.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.828
Serena's family runs an escort service

16:35.912 --> 16:38.123
out of a massage parlour down town, OK?

16:38.207 --> 16:41.168
All these ladies have been working with us
since they were 16 years old.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.255
They alone bring in 200 grand a month.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.967
While you two were going to
some fancy business school,

16:48.050 --> 16:50.468
I was working with my dad since I was 12.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.678
It's what I do.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.848
Luca, I can appreciate that.

16:54.932 --> 16:57.225
But you do not have enough family

16:57.308 --> 16:59.395
to move the amount of product we plan for.

16:59.478 --> 17:00.687
Look,

17:00.770 --> 17:03.273
my father doesn't think
we should be getting into fentanyl.

17:03.357 --> 17:05.525
And let me tell you,
he's right to be cautious, OK?

17:05.608 --> 17:08.237
Something goes wrong,
and the heat will come down so hard,

17:08.319 --> 17:09.988
it'll bring everything to a stop.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.573
So we gotta be smart, precise.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.617
This is a new product,
and you can't even tell me

17:14.702 --> 17:16.578
if it's gonna kill everyone who uses it.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.122
So we have to roll it out
in a controlled environment.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.625
We start small with people we can trust.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.545
You guys wanna do this yourselves

17:24.627 --> 17:26.672
and drop dime bags from the sky, go ahead.

17:27.882 --> 17:31.302
But you wanna build something that lasts,
you listen to me.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.347
Let's talk more over lunch.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.477
If that was an offer, thank you,

17:39.560 --> 17:41.353
but, uh, I got other plans.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.313
It wasn't an offer.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.902
Siro?

18:00.747 --> 18:02.207
Hey.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.377
Reggie, come on. We gotta sit tight.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.587
We're gonna be out of here
in no time, trust me.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.262
Cockroach. I don't like bugs.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.848
Who does?

18:17.932 --> 18:19.307
I hate bugs.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.062
A lot.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.772
Your mother hated bugs, man.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.273
She was terrified.

18:31.362 --> 18:34.990
She must've been about four,
and I was eight,

18:35.073 --> 18:37.952
and we were living in this real shithole.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.120
And there was floorboards missing.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.663
You could actually see the ground.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.875
Our old man
was on the needle by that point.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.338
Your mum
and I always shared a room together.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.798
I never left her alone.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.675
I never let her out of my sight.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.470
And this one night,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.640
she started to scream.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.933
She was crying. She was freaking out.

19:03.143 --> 19:05.937
She was being bit by all these bedbugs.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.857
She tried to run out the door.
I wouldn't let her.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.652
The old man was on a bender
with all his other loser friends.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.867
I just told her... to come over to my bed,

19:18.783 --> 19:20.202
crawl on my back.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.455
That way the bugs
would bite me and not her.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.253
She slept

19:30.337 --> 19:33.423
so peacefully all night on my back,

19:34.382 --> 19:35.967
her little arms wrapped around my neck

19:36.802 --> 19:38.428
so she wouldn't fall off.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.352
I loved her.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.487
What are you doing home from school?

19:56.322 --> 19:58.532
- I got sent home.
- What the hell?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.410
Sent home?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.913
You've been fighting?

20:04.997 --> 20:07.082
You know what your father says
about fighting.

20:07.165 --> 20:08.917
I don't remember but...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.085
next time I see him in jail,
I'll be sure to ask.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.408
You must be Nats.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.493
I'm Bobby.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.165
Your uncle Domenic hired me.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.875
For your protection.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.767
We got two rules.

21:08.102 --> 21:10.103
We don't protect pigs who touch kids.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.107
And when we decide
we're gonna protect you,

21:13.190 --> 21:14.650
it's written in stone.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.610
No one's gonna touch you
now that we're tight.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.778
Alright.

21:19.738 --> 21:20.905
Thanks.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.575
Domenic told me why you're in.

21:24.827 --> 21:26.285
How old's your kid?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.832
He'll be a year next week.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.083
Ah, missing a birthday.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.335
It's tough.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.510
You got kids?

21:43.428 --> 21:44.637
Son.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.723
14.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.642
What about the mum? She around?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.020
Yeah.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.605
Yeah, she's taking care of him.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.608
Well, at least he's got his mum.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.250
So, guys, are we done here?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.670
No! We got one more boat to walk through.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.088
And, uh, if you could find me a coffee,
that'd be great.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.717
- You want one?
- I'd love one.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.510
Make it two.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.648
It's alright. We'll be out of here soon.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.663
This is ridiculous,
and you know it.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.917
No, I don't. We need this.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.170
You need more than this
if you wanna justify a part six.

22:58.253 --> 23:00.255
And are you seriously
considering placing a bug

23:00.338 --> 23:03.007
- in a prison visitation room?
- I'll arrange it with the warden

23:03.092 --> 23:05.802
that we only monitor
Nats' conversations with his family.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.114
You're coming to me
because if you bring this to a judge,

23:08.138 --> 23:10.033
- he will throw it back in your face.
- Sir, if I may,

23:10.057 --> 23:12.517
One of the things I respect most about you

23:12.600 --> 23:15.312
is how you do it by the book,
but how would this look to the public?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.522
I mean, if they found out after the fact
that we knew

23:17.605 --> 23:20.650
the Cosoletos were manufacturing fentanyl
and we did nothing about it.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.943
I don't think we want
that blood on our hands

23:23.987 --> 23:25.363
or those headlines, sir.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.300
By the book.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.343
Of course.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.478
- You catch more bees with honey.
- Shut up!

24:01.942 --> 24:03.902
You said in and out. Now there's cops?

24:03.985 --> 24:06.445
We gotta wait for my guy
to tell us it's clear, Reg.

24:06.530 --> 24:07.530
We're fine in here.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.240
Come on!

24:10.075 --> 24:11.785
Can we go?

24:11.868 --> 24:13.453
No, we gotta hang tight.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.247
I really need to get out of here.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.707
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah!

24:20.502 --> 24:22.337
What's this date-night thing again?

24:23.630 --> 24:25.715
Once a week,
we get the kids to her parents' house.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.260
we go out, get some dinner,
go for a massage.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.637
What, together?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.347
Yeah, as a couple.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.515
You go to one of those
Asian joints or something?

24:34.598 --> 24:35.725
It's not sexual.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.893
Come on. We gotta move, gotta move.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.653
You don't like us very much, do you?

24:47.737 --> 24:49.322
Nats is in jail cos of you.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.117
Nats is in jail because he lost control.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.118
He's lucky we got his son back.

24:54.202 --> 24:56.872
<i>No, he got his son back, OK?</i>

24:56.955 --> 24:58.915
And you're the ones who are lucky he did.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.417
And why is that?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.752
You wanted to punish him
for pulling a gun on you.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.545
Luca,

25:04.628 --> 25:06.422
you are overthinking this.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.258
A monkey could understand this, OK?

25:08.342 --> 25:10.343
He stood up to you two,
and you didn't like that.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.388
Who keeps calling you, hmm?

25:14.847 --> 25:16.600
Oh!

25:17.475 --> 25:18.893
It's a dating app.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.520
You have a lot of messages here.

25:21.605 --> 25:22.897
Yeah, I do.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.817
She's not bad.

25:26.652 --> 25:28.027
Terrible hat, though.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.362
Delete!

25:30.322 --> 25:32.823
And this one

25:32.907 --> 25:34.492
has nice hips.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.703
Good for a little ride.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.500
Let's check for the prospects.

25:43.793 --> 25:46.462
She is the sexiest, but...

25:49.132 --> 25:50.550
Have a look at her.

25:51.258 --> 25:55.097
Not as pretty,
but you will have more fun with her.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.140
Trust me.

25:57.765 --> 25:58.808
Alright.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.227
And you?

26:01.310 --> 26:04.313
Oh, wait.
No, you don't use a phone to get laid.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.023
No, I don't.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.655
What do you think I do?

26:13.615 --> 26:16.325
Oh, I think when you're hungry, you eat.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.505
You know what?

26:29.588 --> 26:30.798
I'm gonna take your advice.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.343
I'll let you know how this one goes too.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.428
Alright?

26:37.722 --> 26:39.223
Lunch is on me.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.733
Are you serious?

26:54.947 --> 26:56.825
Let's go out tonight.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.705
So, uh, she get
massaged by a guy or a girl?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.123
A guy.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.542
- You?
- A girl.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.670
- Always?
- Always.

27:10.297 --> 27:11.588
Believe me, it's sexual.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.633
You're reading way too much into this.

27:13.717 --> 27:14.800
Mm-hmm.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.468
You know what I think?

27:16.552 --> 27:18.272
I think it's a subtle way
for the two of you

27:18.347 --> 27:20.432
to say you want a little bit more variety.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.725
No, I'm not looking for any variety.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.935
This is therapeutic.

27:24.018 --> 27:25.228
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

27:25.312 --> 27:27.105
Then, next time,
get the guy do the rubbing.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.440
Hey, look at this.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.025
That's not right.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.527
Open it up.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.865
That's us.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.042
What's happening?

27:50.795 --> 27:52.755
Breathe, Reggie. Come on, stay quiet.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.513
Check it out.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.935
That's us! What do we...

28:06.018 --> 28:07.937
Don't make a sound.

28:15.570 --> 28:18.155
You must have friends in high places.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.740
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

28:20.617 --> 28:22.577
Visiting hours are long over.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.463
Hi.

28:35.298 --> 28:37.633
Oh, my God, look at you!
Look at you! Come here!

28:38.468 --> 28:40.345
Oh, baby.

28:41.847 --> 28:43.515
I never wanna let you go.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.727
Ah!

28:47.810 --> 28:49.978
- Hey, have a seat.
- You look good.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.688
Yeah? How was the drive?

28:51.773 --> 28:53.567
- It was good. It was good, yeah.
- Yeah?

28:53.650 --> 28:55.777
You look good. You look real good.

28:55.860 --> 28:59.780
- I need to talk to you, babe.
- Yeah, no doubt. How you doing?

28:59.863 --> 29:01.282
- Oh!
- You OK?

29:01.365 --> 29:02.867
How are you doing? I didn't even ask.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.493
- Me? I'm OK, you know?
- Such a dick.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.913
No, you're not. Don't say that.

29:06.997 --> 29:09.082
Hey! I miss you, OK?

29:09.165 --> 29:10.708
I miss Adamo too.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.627
Yeah, we miss you too, a lot.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.213
I know.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.465
Zio's got good people looking out for me,

29:17.548 --> 29:19.508
with the lawyers
and stuff like that, so...

29:21.593 --> 29:23.763
What's up? Hey.

29:23.847 --> 29:25.848
I'm right here now, OK?

29:25.932 --> 29:28.058
You're still taken care of.

29:28.142 --> 29:31.312
- I love you.
- I love you more than ever.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.608
We're together still. It's gonna be OK.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.448
What's wrong? Hey, Val, what is it?

29:44.075 --> 29:45.910
Babe...

29:49.288 --> 29:50.498
I messed up.

29:50.582 --> 29:53.835
You didn't mess up.
No, you didn't mess up, OK?

29:53.918 --> 29:55.503
Nobody can predict the future...

29:55.587 --> 29:56.753
I cheated on you.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.923
- You what?
- I cheated on you,

29:59.007 --> 30:01.508
and I got caught by this detective,

30:01.592 --> 30:05.053
and she told me if I didn't tell
her stuff, she would tell you.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.435
That you cheated on me?

30:11.685 --> 30:14.188
She wanted to ruin our life.
I didn't know what to do.

30:14.272 --> 30:15.440
You...

30:16.942 --> 30:18.108
With who?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.737
- It doesn't matter.
- No, it matters.

30:20.820 --> 30:21.947
It happened one time.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.198
Who did you cheat on me with, Valentina?

30:24.282 --> 30:25.533
Who?

30:26.575 --> 30:28.285
It doesn't even matter! I swear to God...

30:28.368 --> 30:30.413
Valentina, who did you cheat on me with?

30:30.497 --> 30:31.663
It didn't mean anything.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.625
Who was it? It means something.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.418
You tell me right now.
Tell me his name. With who?

30:36.502 --> 30:38.170
- Who?
- It was Lester!

30:39.630 --> 30:41.507
From Adamo's playgroup?

30:41.590 --> 30:44.552
The one whose wife got the fake tits?
Are you serious?

30:44.635 --> 30:45.928
- No!
- Are you serious?

30:46.012 --> 30:47.513
You...

30:49.515 --> 30:51.183
Babe, I don't know why I did it!

30:51.267 --> 30:54.020
I don't know why I did it.
It was so stupid.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.980
It was... I was depressed.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.648
- Depressed?
- I was sad!

30:57.732 --> 30:59.650
<i>I was sad, and I needed...</i>

30:59.733 --> 31:01.652
<i>I love you so much, babe!</i>

31:01.735 --> 31:04.113
<i>And I was scared, and this witch</i>

31:04.197 --> 31:06.032
<i>started making me say things.</i>

31:06.115 --> 31:07.575
She's started telling me to talk...

31:07.658 --> 31:09.118
Who? Who? Who? Who is she?

31:09.702 --> 31:12.288
<i>Who is this she?
Who is this she that made you talk?</i>

31:13.790 --> 31:16.125
This woman from the RCMP,
Nellie something.

31:17.335 --> 31:19.753
<i>What, what did you say to her?</i>

31:19.837 --> 31:21.755
Hey! What did you say to her?

31:21.838 --> 31:24.092
Nothing. Honestly, nothing.

31:24.175 --> 31:25.593
What did you say?

31:25.677 --> 31:29.888
Just... just about the two,
Christian and Teresa.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.848
Shit.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.393
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

31:34.477 --> 31:37.230
You tell me your exact goddamn words
that you said to her,

31:37.313 --> 31:38.815
exactly what you said to her.

31:38.898 --> 31:42.443
Exactly, word for word,
you tell me what you said to her.

31:42.527 --> 31:44.278
What does she know?

31:46.280 --> 31:47.407
I just...

31:47.490 --> 31:48.950
It's... Just...

31:49.033 --> 31:50.618
Listen, just about the fentanyl,

31:50.702 --> 31:52.542
but that they wanna do it
and you don't want to

31:52.620 --> 31:54.413
and your family doesn't want to.

31:54.497 --> 31:56.790
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, hey, hey!

31:56.873 --> 31:58.877
Calm down! Come on! Settle down!

31:58.960 --> 32:02.047
- <i>Are you kidding me?
- Alright, calm down!</i>

32:02.130 --> 32:04.173
You keep your mouth shut!

32:04.257 --> 32:06.133
Valentina, keep your goddamn mouth shut!

32:06.217 --> 32:09.012
- About your whoring! About everything!
- Hey! Let go of him!

32:09.095 --> 32:11.055
You don't talk to anybody!

32:11.138 --> 32:12.848
- Can you do that, Valentina?
- Yes!

32:12.932 --> 32:14.350
Keep your goddamn mouth shut!

32:14.433 --> 32:15.893
I never should've trusted you!

32:15.977 --> 32:17.228
Let's go! Come on!

32:17.312 --> 32:19.063
I trusted you!

32:19.147 --> 32:20.272
- Come on!
- You stupid...

32:33.912 --> 32:36.014
<i>Hey, Cochrane,
what's going on over there?</i>

32:36.038 --> 32:37.415
We're almost done.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.877
<i>We're gonna watch the game tonight
at Sir Winston's.</i>

32:40.960 --> 32:42.795
<i>- You guys coming?</i>
- Wanna go?

32:43.462 --> 32:44.922
Yeah, we'll be there.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.340
Close it up.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.138
Wait a second.

32:52.222 --> 32:53.765
What's that?

32:55.265 --> 32:56.642
What do you got?

32:59.312 --> 33:01.063
It's maybe nothing.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.107
Just go home, boys.

33:06.277 --> 33:09.988
Don't they pack these
before they load them onto the container?

33:10.072 --> 33:11.657
That's weird.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.785
This crate looks cracked.

33:15.912 --> 33:17.247
What was that?

33:18.663 --> 33:19.790
Quiet, quiet.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.208
You stay put.

33:21.292 --> 33:22.627
Quiet, quiet.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.298
Shhh, shhh.

33:42.147 --> 33:44.148
Hey, Cochrane!

33:51.072 --> 33:52.865
You gotta see this!

34:04.210 --> 34:05.920
Mother Mary of God!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.505
That's a hell of a lot of money!

34:08.588 --> 34:11.092
There's gotta be about
a million bucks in here.

34:12.510 --> 34:13.969
It's a lot more than that.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.223
Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?
Put that down.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.933
- We have to call this in.
- What're you out of your mind?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.395
Look where this is going! Mexico!

34:23.520 --> 34:25.313
This is drug money, pure and simple.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.025
Besides, not as if we're taking
a payoff from anybody, right?

34:29.902 --> 34:31.152
No one needs to know.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.947
You can't seriously
be thinking about keeping this?

34:34.032 --> 34:36.699
We work our asses off.
We put our lives on the line for what?

34:36.783 --> 34:39.745
You keep telling me you gotta get out
of that apartment for the kids

34:39.828 --> 34:41.288
and get into a house, right?

34:41.371 --> 34:42.956
Listen, this...

34:43.040 --> 34:45.250
is a winning lottery ticket
on the sidewalk,

34:45.333 --> 34:46.877
and we just found it.

34:47.837 --> 34:49.088
No.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.672
No!

34:51.757 --> 34:53.675
We have to call this in.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.177
Listen to me!

34:55.260 --> 34:57.847
You remember that Haitian kid

34:57.930 --> 34:59.640
that you arrested last fall?

34:59.723 --> 35:03.560
You beat him up pretty bad.
Poor kid lost his hearing.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.187
I covered for you.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.022
But I can tell 'em the truth.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.192
No more career, no job, no pension.

35:11.527 --> 35:12.820
You son of a...

35:12.903 --> 35:15.030
You know that was an accident.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.242
<i>Hey, you guys all clear?
What's the hold up?</i>

35:17.325 --> 35:19.285
<i>We're heading for the bar.</i>

35:21.287 --> 35:23.413
<i>Uh, guys? Everything OK over there?</i>

35:23.497 --> 35:25.457
Yeah, all clear.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.335
We'll see you there.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.670
You do what you wanna do, but I'm out.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.715
It's an opportunity of a lifetime, kid.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.467
I ain't no rat,
and I'll take this to the grave,

35:36.343 --> 35:38.220
but I want nothing to do with this.

35:39.555 --> 35:40.973
Are we good?

35:42.475 --> 35:44.185
Are we good?

35:44.977 --> 35:46.895
Yeah, we're good.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.315
Tell everyone I wasn't up for it,

35:50.398 --> 35:52.277
and I'll see you
back at the station tomorrow.

36:06.707 --> 36:08.208
Put your hands up, pal.

36:09.502 --> 36:11.212
Stand up slow. You know the drill.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.383
- Drop it.
- Uh-uh.

36:16.467 --> 36:17.385
Put it down.

36:17.468 --> 36:19.220
Why would you do that?

36:19.303 --> 36:20.555
I said put it down.

36:20.638 --> 36:22.557
I was listening to you and your partner,

36:23.598 --> 36:24.850
and it got me wondering.

36:24.933 --> 36:28.395
When did guys like us
lose that youthful idealism?

36:28.478 --> 36:29.897
Drop it now.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.690
I understand, man, this is hard,

36:31.773 --> 36:33.192
letting something like that

36:33.275 --> 36:35.068
slip through your dirty fingers, ain't it?

36:35.152 --> 36:37.153
But I'm doing you a favour.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.365
That money, it's not mine.

36:39.448 --> 36:40.825
We know it's not yours.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.535
But the people it belongs to,

36:42.618 --> 36:44.995
trust me,
you and I do not wanna screw with.

36:46.330 --> 36:47.873
Thanks for the tip.

36:47.957 --> 36:50.585
I'm always looking for detectives
with your perspective.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.253
Leave it, walk away,

36:53.337 --> 36:55.297
and I will make you
so much more, I promise.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.425
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- Can't do it.

36:57.508 --> 37:00.052
- Do it. I'll blow your head off!
- No, you won't do that.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.470
I'm gonna count to three.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.390
One, two...

37:08.893 --> 37:10.145
Hey, hey.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.563
I couldn't let him do that.

37:11.647 --> 37:12.690
I know, I know.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.233
- Come on, come on.
- Oh no.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.652
It's gonna be alright.

37:15.735 --> 37:17.778
Is he OK?

37:19.238 --> 37:20.823
He's gonna be OK, right?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.787
- We'll get him some help!
- He's dead.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.078
No, he's not.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.747
- Yeah, he is.
- No, he's not.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.457
He was gonna shoot you, right?

37:32.125 --> 37:34.628
He was gonna shoot you, yeah?

37:35.378 --> 37:36.797
Oh, my God!

37:37.465 --> 37:40.050
I didn't mean to do that! Oh, my God!

37:40.133 --> 37:41.635
It's OK! It's OK! It's OK!

37:41.718 --> 37:43.220
- I didn't mean to do that!
- It's OK!

37:43.303 --> 37:44.805
- I didn't mean to do that!
- Breathe!

37:44.888 --> 37:47.140
It's OK, it's OK! It was an accident.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.518
Come on, now. Come on, now.
Get it together!

37:49.602 --> 37:50.812
- It was an accident!
- OK.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.858
Reggie, look at that. Cops are gone.

37:55.942 --> 37:59.028
Look, cops are gone, OK?
This boat's leaving soon.

37:59.112 --> 38:01.113
Come on, we're a team. We gotta do this.

38:01.197 --> 38:02.948
We gotta clean this mess up.

38:03.032 --> 38:04.533
I was trying to help you.

38:04.617 --> 38:06.743
- It's an accident.
- We're gonna clean this up.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.538
Then we're gonna get the hell out of here.
OK? We gotta do that now.

38:09.622 --> 38:11.207
What are we gonna do with him?

38:12.082 --> 38:14.085
What are we gonna do with him?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.545
He's going to Mexico.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.613
Wes! Check it out!

38:45.282 --> 38:48.368
I thought you might
wanna play with your friends or with me.

38:48.452 --> 38:50.747
What do you say? Little one-on-one?

38:50.830 --> 38:53.665
I have some free time,
and ten bucks says you can't beat me.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.208
No, thanks.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.670
What the hell are you doing here?

39:40.755 --> 39:43.215
If you'd just answer my calls,
we wouldn't need to be here.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.550
No, we're done. I told him everything.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.845
I told Nats everything, you hear me?

39:47.928 --> 39:49.555
I don't owe you anything anymore.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.348
- Look, I'm worried about you.
- You got nothing on me now.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.058
- You don't get it.
- I don't get what?

39:54.143 --> 39:55.978
They're gonna kill you.

39:56.062 --> 39:58.313
Oh, now you're worried about me?

39:58.397 --> 40:00.273
You know what?

40:00.983 --> 40:02.108
Shove it up your ass!

40:02.192 --> 40:03.735
- Val...
- I'm done!

40:03.818 --> 40:05.863
Don't you ever call me again!

40:05.947 --> 40:07.448
You are not... Val!

40:29.178 --> 40:31.138
What about her in the red dress?

40:33.348 --> 40:35.267
She looks like an escort.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.268
That's never stopped you before.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.357
Her?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.733
Not bad,

40:42.817 --> 40:45.152
but look at that tacky dress. Please.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.447
You're really being difficult tonight,
hmm?

40:48.530 --> 40:50.950
Stop thinking about everyone back home.

40:51.033 --> 40:52.702
It will work out.

40:52.785 --> 40:54.412
Papa gave this to us

40:54.495 --> 40:56.455
because he knew that we could handle it,

40:56.538 --> 40:57.748
and we can.

40:57.832 --> 40:59.667
We'll give Luca a month.

40:59.750 --> 41:02.920
As long as he does what we say,
it will work out.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.797
What do you see in him?

41:05.840 --> 41:07.508
Authenticity.

41:23.023 --> 41:25.358
He looks, um, innocent.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.027
Could be fun!

41:27.110 --> 41:29.028
But it's your turn tonight.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.948
Am I counting?

41:56.807 --> 41:58.683
I want to give you to my brother.

42:36.513 --> 42:38.098
It's not your fault.

42:39.725 --> 42:41.060
Reggie, it's not your fault.

42:43.062 --> 42:44.730
I wanna go home.

42:44.813 --> 42:46.148
Alright.

42:57.367 --> 42:59.118
I saw a lot of police.

42:59.202 --> 43:01.913
Payment's in full. It's on its way.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.040
But there was a little problem.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.668
Get some extra cargo, dead cop.

43:06.752 --> 43:09.003
So you make your problem our problem?

43:09.087 --> 43:10.130
I had to be flexible,

43:10.213 --> 43:11.673
so now you do too.

43:11.757 --> 43:13.508
That's how we get things done.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.680
Actually, Declan,
our deal with you is over.

43:19.682 --> 43:21.933
You're in the middle of a war here,

43:22.017 --> 43:24.102
and that is not good for business.

43:46.292 --> 43:47.877
Who is that guy?

43:54.257 --> 43:56.177
Maybe you should walk away.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.930
Just... Just leave it all.

44:04.308 --> 44:06.395
We could go anywhere, right?

44:08.813 --> 44:10.398
Declan?

44:12.525 --> 44:14.235
What are you thinking?

44:15.570 --> 44:17.572
This would be the right time.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.533
Leave it all.

44:22.703 --> 44:24.287
Just leave it all.

44:28.667 --> 44:31.920
<i>Next time on </i> Bad Blood:
- Eight fentanyl overdoses at the weekend.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.843
<i>A couple of kids
they found on a reserve.</i>

44:33.922 --> 44:35.298
We're shutting it down.

44:35.382 --> 44:37.550
Pop's says we're out, OK,
but I'm still in.

44:37.633 --> 44:39.887
Dealers are mixing fentanyl with cocaine.

44:39.970 --> 44:41.597
Who would put poison in drugs?

44:41.680 --> 44:43.598
Teresa and Christian are who you want.

44:43.682 --> 44:46.060
Well, we want you to only buy from us.
No more Declan.

44:46.143 --> 44:49.688
Right now, a gangster is running
a better investigation than we are.

44:49.772 --> 44:51.065
Tell me everything.

44:51.148 --> 44:52.858
- Hi, Enzo.
- I don't know you.

44:52.942 --> 44:54.818
Nellie Bullock, RCMP.

44:54.902 --> 44:57.278
<i>The only way we win is to get them...</i>

44:57.362 --> 45:00.073
to rip themselves apart from the inside.
