WEBVTT

00:01.780 --> 00:03.554
Previously onSEAL Team...I lied about the shoulder.

00:03.610 --> 00:04.554
You just gonna keep
punishing me for that?

00:04.610 --> 00:05.770
This is _not about me
punishing you,

00:05.830 --> 00:07.434
this is about me
not trusting you.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.435
How am I gonna earn
back that trust

00:08.480 --> 00:09.959
trapped in a
damn classroom?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.307
DAVIS: I reapplied
to Officer Candidate School,

00:11.350 --> 00:12.829
figured you should know.ERIC:
You are a leader.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.484
You get in, you go.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.839
You don't know
when you'll be back?

00:16.880 --> 00:18.438
No, it's just a little spin up.I can live being
afraid for you,

00:20.150 --> 00:21.663
JASON:
I found my own place.

00:21.710 --> 00:22.665
It's not like
you're around anyway.

00:22.710 --> 00:23.972
What do you want from me?

00:24.020 --> 00:26.659
I guess what I really want
is for you not to die.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.449
I'm not gonna die.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.489
I don't believe you.

01:24.950 --> 01:27.032
[muffled shouting
in Arabic]

02:13.430 --> 02:14.738
No.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.116
Look at that--
fresh coffee, huh?

02:48.160 --> 02:50.116
Got the machine to work and all.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.161
Congratulations, you can take it
to your new place.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.461
Someone's mad at me.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.999
No.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.644
Morning. We got to
get moving, Mom.

02:56.690 --> 02:59.250
Uh, honey, a broker's
open in Pungo came up.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.517
Dad's taking you.

03:00.570 --> 03:04.301
Wow. Last time
I saw you that excited

03:04.350 --> 03:06.170
was when we got you

03:06.220 --> 03:07.562
a singing bear for Christmas.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.656
That was Elmo,
not a bear.

03:09.710 --> 03:12.349
If it's not a bear, what is it?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.004
Dad, the tour
starts at 8:00,

03:14.060 --> 03:15.402
and I won't allow your desire
to suddenly understand

03:15.450 --> 03:16.667
Elmo's genus
make me late

03:16.710 --> 03:17.972
for my first
college tour.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.009
Huh.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.584
Can you pour
me one, too?

03:20.630 --> 03:22.541
Look at you, high octane, when
did you start drinking coffee?

03:22.590 --> 03:25.104
Since I had to leave
for a college tour

03:25.160 --> 03:26.411
at the butt crack
of dawn.

03:26.460 --> 03:27.939
Coffee.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.242
What about "please"? "Please
pour me a cup of coffee."

03:30.290 --> 03:32.633
_ Does that not work
In your vocabulary anymore

03:32.690 --> 03:35.113
Coffee, coming up.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.085
SONNY:
Is that Davis?

03:43.130 --> 03:44.563
Davis!

03:44.610 --> 03:48.137
Hey, Davis!

03:48.180 --> 03:50.136
Davis!

03:50.180 --> 03:51.613
Headphones, bro.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.264
SONNY: Oh, yeah.
It's just so strange, you know.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.708
She's not really
a morning person.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.798
So...

03:56.840 --> 03:59.354
what you get your FRAN time
down to

03:59.410 --> 04:00.627
Shoulder's strong as hell.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.183
5:45.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.628
Say what you're
trying to say, Sonny,

04:03.670 --> 04:04.841
save us the time.

04:04.890 --> 04:08.326
Well... you know,
I was in Jason's ear.

04:08.370 --> 04:10.895
Bravo machine,
it's missing a gear.

04:10.940 --> 04:13.374
I appreciate it, brother, but...

04:13.420 --> 04:15.809
with Jason, it's about
more than the shoulder.

04:15.860 --> 04:19.114
Come on, Ray, we've all
played hurt, all right?

04:19.170 --> 04:20.330
You remember
that, uh,

04:20.390 --> 04:23.200
convoy ta kedown
outside Kabul?

04:23.260 --> 04:25.125
Well, the night before,
I sprained my wrist

04:25.170 --> 04:26.341
punching a tree.

04:26.390 --> 04:29.564
Okay, Sonny,
why'd you punch a tree?

04:29.610 --> 04:31.601
I got twisted up on that
green raisin moonshine

04:31.660 --> 04:35.175
that the locals make, you know,
and I swear, there was

04:35.230 --> 04:37.744
this tree that was kind of
looking at me strange.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.963
You know, so we got into it,

04:40.010 --> 04:42.012
and I knocked that sucker
right out of his roots.

04:42.060 --> 04:44.142
My point being,
is that

04:44.190 --> 04:46.920
I didn't tell a damn soul
that I hurt my wrist.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.008
Well, man or tree, no one's
gonna eyeball you, Sonny.

04:51.070 --> 04:52.844
Look, man, I...

04:52.900 --> 04:54.629
Thanks for having my back,

04:54.680 --> 04:57.023
but all of you start
going at Jason, taking my side,

04:57.070 --> 04:58.241
he'll just double down.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.769
It's not about sides, Ray.

04:59.820 --> 05:01.902
It's about getting the wolf pack
back together.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.460
Brother, you know you're gonna

05:05.520 --> 05:07.294
have to wrap your head
around something.

05:09.390 --> 05:11.119
I may not be back.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.261
Give 'em hell, yeah?

05:25.670 --> 05:27.149
Mandy.

05:27.190 --> 05:28.669
Davis, hi.
Hey.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.972
Been a while.
How you doing?

05:30.020 --> 05:32.068
You know,
I'm grinding.

05:32.110 --> 05:35.193
World still stubbornly refuses
to give peace a chance.

05:36.330 --> 05:38.116
How are you?
I'm good, yeah.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.411
How's Jason doing?

05:39.460 --> 05:41.246
Oh, they cleared him.
Yeah, his head's fine.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.679
Good. And Bravo?

05:43.730 --> 05:46.335
Clay's two, so, you know,
he's feeling his oats.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.120
Sonny's Sonny.

05:48.170 --> 05:50.866
Um, oh, you know,
Ray's out at Green Team.

05:50.910 --> 05:52.081
You don't think he's
out for good, though?

05:52.130 --> 05:53.347
I hope not.

05:53.390 --> 05:55.119
You know,
it's above my pay grade.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.260
Oh, damn, I'm late
for my flight.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.789
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, Blackburn told me

05:59.830 --> 06:01.434
you're putting together
a new target package?

06:01.490 --> 06:02.434
Iam.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.572
Something big,
closer to home.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.611
How close?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.228
Hey, you don't have to...

06:08.280 --> 06:09.349
Mexico.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.275
Oh.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.368
Okay, no. Fine.

06:15.410 --> 06:17.412
No, but I never said that.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.418
Ma, I am not giving up
on my doctorate, I just...

06:20.460 --> 06:22.189
Mom! I...

06:24.340 --> 06:26.285
Uh_-huh.
Okay, fIne, then,

06:26.340 --> 06:28.205
j-just-- let's just
drop it, then.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.686
Mm-hmm. All right.

06:31.730 --> 06:35.473
Dinner this weekend?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.078
Oh, you're driving down

06:37.130 --> 06:39.257
to meet Clay.

06:39.310 --> 06:40.652
I don't know, I...

06:40.700 --> 06:41.917
It's fine.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.133
It's fine.

06:44.180 --> 06:45.431
No, you do not
know my parents.

06:45.490 --> 06:46.787
I have to meet
'em sometime.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.876
It's all right, this has
to happen eventually.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.704
[speaking indistinctly
over phone]

06:50.750 --> 06:54.049
No, I heard everything. Yeah,
no, Clay would love to meet you.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.408
He would.

06:55.450 --> 06:57.236
We just, with his schedule,
we can't really...

06:57.280 --> 07:00.408
Of course.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.679
Of course, we will make it work
if we can.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.985
I love you.
Okay, bye.

07:07.030 --> 07:11.239
You do not know what
you're getting yourself Into.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.337
On your right is our state
of the art media complex,

07:16.390 --> 07:19.211
where students produce
everything from news broadcasts

07:19.260 --> 07:22.343
to virtual reality
experiences.

07:22.390 --> 07:24.176
Up ahead is our
campus coffee shop.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.176
Karaoke and pizza

07:26.220 --> 07:28.745
every Tuesday.
Yeah, I'm sure
we can do that.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.223
It seems like our girls
are fast friends, huh?

07:30.270 --> 07:33.797
Yeah.
Nice campus, huh?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.400
Of course this is
a safety for my Katie.

07:36.450 --> 07:39.180
She's really hoping
for Yale or Princeton.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.582
But between
you and me,

07:40.630 --> 07:42.279
her GPA's
only a 4.1.

07:42.330 --> 07:44.104
4.1?

07:44.150 --> 07:47.802
Yeah, better than perfect,
not enough. What a world.

07:47.850 --> 07:50.193
Uh, what about
your daughter?

07:50.250 --> 07:52.673
JASON: Uh... Whatever
choice she makes,

07:52.730 --> 07:54.425
I'm there for her.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.938
She's happy, I'm happy.
Excuse me.

07:56.990 --> 07:58.685
Uh, great talking to you.

07:58.730 --> 08:00.994
I kind of love it here.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.292
Is this a safety school for you?

08:03.350 --> 08:05.568
Safety? I should know
what that is, right?

08:05.610 --> 08:08.215
It means it's a lock
that I'll get in here.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.615
Okay. All right, yeah.
It's nice. I like it.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.651
You know what, hey,
I support any choice you make.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.439
All right?

08:15.490 --> 08:17.094
Just, you know, you end up
at a frat party,

08:17.140 --> 08:18.573
I may have to gather up the boys

08:18.620 --> 08:20.224
and crack some skulls,
you understand?

08:20.280 --> 08:21.929
I'm not joking.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.329
Work?

08:26.370 --> 08:27.405
Yup, work.

08:27.460 --> 08:28.415
Hmm.

08:28.460 --> 08:30.109
Remind me not to pick a career

08:30.160 --> 08:32.242
that can turn my life
upside down at any moment

08:32.290 --> 08:35.509
and screw up my kid's day.

08:35.550 --> 08:38.428
Right.
It's fine.

08:38.470 --> 08:41.428
I'll come back with Mom
to see the rest of the school.

08:41.470 --> 08:42.459
JASON:
Okay.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.742
I'll have what
he's having.

09:04.450 --> 09:06.498
I don't think
she likes you.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.360
That's unfortunate.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.583
That's predictable.

09:10.630 --> 09:12.541
Nobody likes an
arrogant American

09:12.590 --> 09:14.069
who thinks she can
stroll in here

09:14.110 --> 09:16.931
and intimidate us locals.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.503
It's bad manners.

09:18.550 --> 09:21.018
MANDY:
I apologize for offending

09:21.080 --> 09:22.468
your Victorian
sensibilities.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.424
Graham Kowit.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.293
I don't know who that is.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.045
American DEA agent,

09:33.090 --> 09:34.432
went missing a few weeks ago,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.472
and I'm guessing you know
where to, Fausto.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.960
Only friends use my name.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.750
Be careful, it can be
terribly unhealthy

09:48.800 --> 09:52.327
for a foreigner to poke her nose
in the wrong places,

09:52.370 --> 09:53.496
in my world.

09:53.540 --> 09:56.498
My advice:
focus on your own health.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.617
Davis, saw you
working out early.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.481
It's a little
out of the ordinary.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.998
What's out of the ordinary
is that you weren't tied up

10:29.060 --> 10:31.051
with a bunch of strippers
when we got paged.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.362
JASON: Strippers.OTHERS: Ooh!

10:32.410 --> 10:33.923
SONNY:
Hey, don't be judgy, Davis.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.403
Okay, nothing wrong
with bunches of strippers.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.587
Okay, the swarm seems best.

10:38.630 --> 10:40.063
JASON: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
excuse me there,

10:40.110 --> 10:43.159
Mr. GQ, no, no, no, you do
not get to comment, okay?

10:43.200 --> 10:45.543
Stella pulled you out
of that pool, buddy.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.669
Really not loving the
new nickname there.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.072
You're not
feeling it?

10:48.120 --> 10:49.678
Tell you what, why don't you
pick your own, then?

10:49.730 --> 10:51.379
No, it's bad luck to
pick your own nickname.

10:51.430 --> 10:52.909
I learned that
from my good buddy

10:52.950 --> 10:54.429
Fooﬂong.

10:54.470 --> 10:56.119
God rest his
exaggerating soul.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.694
Fooﬂong.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.344
All right,
listen up.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.563
Hope you packed your Ambiens,
gonna be a long flight.

11:01.610 --> 11:02.736
JASON:
Where we headed?

11:02.790 --> 11:06.567
Saudi Arabia.
Three hours ago,

11:06.620 --> 11:10.704
Shia extremists took hold
of the Qanat of Shaqra.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.570
Qanats are ancient
tunnel systems

11:12.620 --> 11:14.440
that access underground
water sources.

11:14.490 --> 11:16.629
This particular qanat

11:16.670 --> 11:18.661
is at the heart of the largest
water source in Saudi Arabia.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.529
They intend to release

11:20.590 --> 11:22.717
anthrax into the water

11:22.760 --> 11:25.376
if their demands are
not met within 24 hours.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.150
What are their demands?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.464
Does it matter?
They're not getting met.

11:30.510 --> 11:33.240
So, the Saudis have asked
for our help on this.

11:33.300 --> 11:36.258
Anthrax is a self-replicating
bacterium.

11:36.300 --> 11:40.555
Released into that aquifer,
no water there

11:40.610 --> 11:42.646
ever again.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.656
God knows how many it
would just plain kill.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.827
Nothing can go wrong here.

12:12.510 --> 12:17.038
MANDY: Doza operates with
impunity and we dig holes.

12:17.080 --> 12:22.029
Corruption and indifference
are his most powerful allies.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.607
You talking to me or yourself?

12:31.310 --> 12:33.562
Hey.

12:40.540 --> 12:43.703
Well, now you found your agent.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.273
Now what?

12:45.320 --> 12:50.235
Now I transform indifference
Into outrage.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.274
Heard Bravo spun up, huh?

13:23.320 --> 13:26.790
You got that twitch.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.536
Operating's not
the only thing, Adam.

13:29.590 --> 13:31.148
But it's the
biggest thing.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.065
Is it?

13:33.110 --> 13:37.854
You know, believe it
or not, I'm good.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.800
Home life is better than ever.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.420
Regular hours. Wife's happy.

13:42.470 --> 13:46.383
Kids are happy.
Yard's looking tip-top.

13:48.430 --> 13:51.388
Told myself the same
lies for a while.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.918
What made you realize
they were lies?

13:56.960 --> 14:00.430
On my way to work,
half awake, for weeks,

14:00.490 --> 14:01.912
I'd drive to my
old squadron.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.309
I've been doing
the same damn thing.

14:10.370 --> 14:14.067
Harder I tried to convince
myself to enjoy shore duty,

14:14.110 --> 14:16.886
harder I wished I
was back out there.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.419
Feels like purgatory
here, brother.

14:18.460 --> 14:19.893
I hear you.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.453
Jason still being stubborn?

14:21.510 --> 14:25.469
I'm cleared hot, but here I am.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.680
Well...

14:29.730 --> 14:32.255
"Well" what?

14:32.300 --> 14:36.304
You hear what's going on
over at Charlie Team?

14:42.050 --> 14:44.006
Right. Our counterparts
in Saudi intelligence

14:44.050 --> 14:47.133
believe that the extremists
are camped out here,

14:47.190 --> 14:50.091
the mother well-- it's
the main source of the water.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.356
How many extremists?

14:51.410 --> 14:53.139
Could be up to 20.
Not really sure.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.055
What are we clear on?

14:55.110 --> 14:57.931
What we do know is that
this modern access tunnel

14:57.980 --> 15:00.619
leads directly
to their encampment,

15:00.680 --> 15:03.023
but the extremists
have collapsed the entrance

15:03.070 --> 15:04.765
right behind them.

15:04.810 --> 15:06.766
Well, why don't we
help them on their way,

15:06.810 --> 15:08.027
blow the damn thing up,
call it early

15:08.080 --> 15:09.763
and hit a happy hour?

15:09.820 --> 15:11.549
That's great,

15:11.600 --> 15:13.204
but the loss of infrastructure

15:13.260 --> 15:14.818
would cripple the region
for decades.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.122
There's no way
we could clear the rubble?

15:17.170 --> 15:18.558
No, not without alerting
them to our presence.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.032
Can't risk it.That's way too rislq.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.125
Tell you what, why
don't we come at 'em

15:21.180 --> 15:22.568
from a different
direction, right?

15:22.610 --> 15:24.396
There's a vertical
access shaft here

15:24.440 --> 15:26.044
on the other side
of the mother well.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.967
I say we rappel in
and we roll in quiet.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.443
Hit 'em here.

15:29.490 --> 15:32.004
That shaft has not
been active in 200 years,

15:32.060 --> 15:35.052
so it's unlikely these guys
even know about it.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.886
And there's gonna be anthrax
canisters they're gonna be

15:36.930 --> 15:38.625
holding onto down there, too. We
don't want to be hitting those.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.059
CLAY: So, based on
some ancient maps,

15:41.110 --> 15:43.283
we're gonna be jumping into an
old hole filled with bad guys,

15:43.330 --> 15:45.286
booby traps,
and poisonous bacterium.

15:45.330 --> 15:46.809
And spiders.

15:46.850 --> 15:49.728
100% there'll be
spiders there.

15:49.770 --> 15:51.203
Them frealq desert kind
that haven't seen people

15:51.250 --> 15:53.298
since Jesus's time. Okay?

15:53.340 --> 15:54.728
What the hell
is this, Goonies?

15:54.770 --> 15:56.294
Yeah, yeah, it's Goonies.

15:56.340 --> 15:57.853
CLAY:
This is all solid rock?

15:57.910 --> 16:00.470
Yeah. Hundreds of meters,
every direction.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.953
All right, well, comms
aren't gonna work then.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.956
Oh, okay, so what's
the solution there?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.820
Line-of-sight relays.

16:05.870 --> 16:08.475
You know, we just position
some men at intervals

16:08.530 --> 16:10.612
and that way
we can ensure

16:10.660 --> 16:13.481
the execution-checklist items
are communicated back to Havoc.

16:13.530 --> 16:14.963
Yeah, we're good?
We're good.

16:15.010 --> 16:16.614
Yeah.
JASON: Sonny's
fully torqued right now.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.399
ERIC:
All right, let's
get some shut-eye.

16:18.450 --> 16:20.884
Riyadh in six hours.Let's go.

16:24.020 --> 16:26.716
Good catch
with the comms, kid.

16:26.760 --> 16:29.365
Uh, just doing my best.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.891
How's Stella?

16:34.120 --> 16:36.076
She good.
Yeah?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.168
Supposed to, uh,

16:38.210 --> 16:39.723
supposed to meet her
parents this weekend.

16:39.780 --> 16:42.123
Oh-ho, meet the parents.

16:42.170 --> 16:45.037
I bet you're hoping this spin up
lasts longer than expected.

16:45.090 --> 16:49.083
Yeah, man. Dude, Stella's
freaking... stressed out.

16:49.130 --> 16:52.008
Starting to think that her
parents maybe aren't real happy

16:52.050 --> 16:54.223
with her choice,
a team guy.
Yeah.

16:54.270 --> 16:56.226
Tell you what,
Stella's opinion

16:56.270 --> 16:58.875
is the only one
that matters. Okay?

17:01.230 --> 17:02.925
My advice to you is, uh,

17:02.970 --> 17:04.528
just-just be you.
Keep it simple.

17:04.580 --> 17:07.401
That's it.
It'll be enough.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.620
Thanks.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.319
Get some sleep, will you?

17:12.330 --> 17:14.059
SONNY:
What's up, Davis?

17:14.120 --> 17:17.203
Dodged my
question earlier.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.117
What was with the early
workout routine?

17:20.160 --> 17:22.333
What's with you creeping
on my workout schedule?

17:22.380 --> 17:24.075
I wasn't creeping.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.519
All right? You jogged
into my line of sight.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.951
I just never known you
as a morning person.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.133
What in the hell?

17:40.010 --> 17:41.739
Kairos.

17:41.790 --> 17:43.576
Kakos!
Hmm?

17:43.620 --> 17:45.884
You try to put some sort
of bewitchment in my boot?

17:45.930 --> 17:47.534
KAIROS:
I wouldn't do that, man.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.322
That type of crystal forms
in natural charcoal layers.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.235
It's an odor eater.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.884
Your boots are malodorous.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.066
CLAY :
It's true, man.

17:55.110 --> 17:57.066
The freaking smell
of those things

17:57.110 --> 17:59.192
make me want to
suckstart a pistol.

18:02.250 --> 18:06.072
I will push you down the stairs
and blame it on the dog.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.382
You understand me?

18:07.430 --> 18:09.990
Keep your hippie
BS to yourself.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.086
JASON:
Oh, wow.

18:13.170 --> 18:15.388
RAY:
Sir?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.783
Senior Chief.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.482
I, um...

18:21.530 --> 18:23.612
wanted to talk to you
about Charlie Team.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.481
So you heard
Drake's getting out

18:26.540 --> 18:28.485
and you want to know
if the position is open.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.189
Close?

18:30.230 --> 18:32.232
Close.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.668
Well, it doesn't help

18:33.720 --> 18:36.712
that you're having a hard time
with Master Chief Hayes.

18:38.070 --> 18:40.061
Doesn't help.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.243
All right, well,
it's not my place to tell you

18:44.290 --> 18:46.155
whether or not
to 10m another team,

18:46.210 --> 18:50.169
but, well, the reason
you haven't quit yet

18:50.210 --> 18:51.859
is 'cause you
don't know how to.

18:51.910 --> 18:54.253
_ It's not
in your skill set.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.689
It may be the right move.

18:56.740 --> 18:58.253
May be the wrong move.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.301
Doesn't really matter
because what does matter

19:00.350 --> 19:02.170
in this particular situation

19:02.220 --> 19:04.131
is a question that
only you can answer:

19:04.180 --> 19:07.308
do you want to teach
yourself how to quit?

19:09.970 --> 19:13.622
May not have a choice... sir.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.185
_ MANDY: _
Flying across eight time zones

19:17.240 --> 19:18.719
will take years off your life.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.228
You haven't aged a day.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.020
Well, turns out that
nonstop, crushing stress

19:24.070 --> 19:27.858
and binge drinking is good
for the complexion.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.720
You should start
a product line.

19:29.770 --> 19:32.637
Once this thing's over,
stay behind a day or two.

19:32.690 --> 19:35.386
I could use your opinion
on a few things.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.606
I'm sure you could.

19:38.650 --> 19:40.606
Excuse me.

19:40.650 --> 19:43.039
Yeah.

19:43.090 --> 19:44.648
Jason, hey.
Hey.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.611
Been a while.
How's the, uh...?

19:46.660 --> 19:48.048
It's good. Perfect.

19:48.090 --> 19:50.046
Sorry I couldn't visit
you in the hospital.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.874
I was, uh...
work's been busy.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.184
Anything you
can talk about?
Soon.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.978
Ibrahim Antar, right?

19:59.020 --> 20:02.399
Yeah, he uncovered the
2010 Transatlantic bomb plot.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.361
JASON: With the help
of one Mandy Ellis.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.411
Can neither
confirm nor deny.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.542
You two seem,
uh, friendly.

20:09.590 --> 20:11.808
Again, I can neither
confirm nor deny.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.634
Attention.

20:17.430 --> 20:19.250
Please be seated.

20:19.300 --> 20:23.259
I would like to extend
a Sincere welcome

20:23.300 --> 20:26.212
to our American counterparts.

20:26.260 --> 20:30.264
The Shia extremist group
Asbat Al-Allah

20:30.310 --> 20:31.789
are threatening to poison
the water supply

20:31.830 --> 20:33.912
to a million Saudis.

20:33.970 --> 20:35.779
Within 48 hours,

20:35.840 --> 20:38.707
a quarter of our population

20:38.750 --> 20:41.230
will be at risk
of contamination.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.933
The extremists are demanding
that we release dozens

20:45.980 --> 20:48.107
of high-ranking
Iranian prisoners.

20:48.150 --> 20:49.492
This will not happen.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.415
Like the United States,

20:51.460 --> 20:53.280
we don't negotiate
with terrorists.

20:53.330 --> 20:56.629
Elimination of the_ threat
is the only option.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.000
The checkpoint is from a
popular movie called Goonies,

21:21.060 --> 21:22.618
a kids' movie, Spielberg.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.418
How far down is that, you think?400 feet.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.589
That thing seriously not
at the bottom yet?

21:39.640 --> 21:40.595
Havoc, this is 1.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.949
Standing by.

21:42.990 --> 21:45.686
Havoc to Bravo 1.
We read you, Lima Charlie.

21:45.730 --> 21:46.901
Good luck down there.

21:46.950 --> 21:50.989
Bravo Team, friendly reminder,

21:51.040 --> 21:53.383
we have 55 minutes until
the extremists' deadline.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.738
We're operating
with only a line of sight.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.917
Comms win_dows
every five minutes.

22:01.140 --> 22:02.653
FULL METAL:
Yo, Hayes.

22:02.710 --> 22:04.223
Yeah?Don't die, man.

22:04.270 --> 22:06.409
Yeah, I'll do my best,
all right?

22:09.890 --> 22:12.404
SONNY:
Hey, Abdul.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.897
Makes you feel any better,
a fall from 200 feet

22:16.940 --> 22:19.329
will kill you just as good
as a fall from 400 feet.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.630
Shouldn't have
told you that, huh?

22:48.670 --> 22:51.013
Havoc, this is 1.
Passed the Chunk.

22:51.060 --> 22:54.314
Roger that, 1, we copy, Chunk.

22:54.370 --> 22:56.406
CLAY:
Bravo 2 to Havoc.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.416
We are proceeding
to enter the tunnel system.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.068
ERIC:
Copy that.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.948
How's your team feeling?

23:08.990 --> 23:10.161
Conﬁdent

23:10.210 --> 23:11.074
Basara, too?

23:13.170 --> 23:15.422
Basara doesn't like uncertainty.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.563
As long as your men make
the comms windows on time,

23:18.610 --> 23:19.861
he'll be fine.

23:22.050 --> 23:24.689
DAVIS: Bravo Team,
mission deadline: 34 mikes.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.141
Repeater, here.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.854
Repeater, here.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.336
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.
I passed Sloth.

23:56.390 --> 23:57.903
CLAY: I passed Sloth.
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.

23:57.950 --> 24:02.603
I passed Sloth.Roger, 2, Havoc copies Sloth.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.365
JASON: Hold up.
Kairos, what's he got?

24:28.460 --> 24:30.155
Look, we don't got time
to meditate, Siddhartha.

24:33.210 --> 24:37.169
Yep. Well, I was just
about to tell you that.

24:37.210 --> 24:38.984
Covering their bases.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.553
Havoc, this is 1.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.682
Go for Havoc.We've stopped.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.514
_We've come across _
a Sowet Claymore and trip Wire.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.640
Bravo 7's on it.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.211
The charge is old,
blasting cap is unstable.

24:50.270 --> 24:51.521
Might take a few.

24:51.570 --> 24:52.821
We don't have a few.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.177
All right.

24:54.230 --> 24:57.051
Havoc, this is 1.
Leaving EOD here.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.488
Moving forward.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.280
Give me some space?

25:21.080 --> 25:22.684
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.
We got troops in contact.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.163
I repeat: troops in contact.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.303
Cover!

25:39.100 --> 25:41.056
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Radio check, over.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.658
What just happened?

25:47.150 --> 25:48.538
Jace!

25:50.240 --> 25:52.231
Bravo 1, Bravo 1. Radio check.

25:52.280 --> 25:55.283
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Radio check, over.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.153
CLAY:
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.373
Loud and clear, 2.
Give me a sitrep.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.240
We're down
one Saudi counterpart.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.292
Bravo 1, Bravo 3, and Bravo 5

26:04.340 --> 26:06.160
are on the other side
of a tunnel collapse.

26:06.210 --> 26:08.258
Their status is unknown.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.995
We got zero comms
with the rest of the team.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.383
Bravo 2, radio check.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.820
Bravo 2, do you copy?SONNY:
Jace.

26:15.870 --> 26:17.132
They had to hear
that explosion.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.659
They're gonna dump
that anthrax.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.395
Don't have a choice.
Press forward.

26:31.190 --> 26:35.365
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.
Radio check, over.

26:35.410 --> 26:38.800
Cannot confirm contact
with the men on the other side?

26:38.850 --> 26:40.112
Negaﬁve.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.151
How will they complete
their comms windows?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.679
They can't until
they clear the cave-in.

26:43.730 --> 26:46.369
Asbat Al-Allah is now
alerted to our presence.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.558
We can't_ risk the lives
of one million CIVIlians.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.819
You failed to set our
conditions. We have no choice.

26:52.870 --> 26:55.430
Commander, evacuate
the rest of your team.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.516
Not until they get
to my other men.

26:57.570 --> 27:00.789
We don't know if they're alive.

27:00.830 --> 27:02.786
And we have_little time
to confirm.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.047
What is your plan, General?

27:11.230 --> 27:12.709
They're enacting a fail-safe.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.057
Why weren't we
aware of this?

27:14.110 --> 27:15.498
I wasn't
until just now.

27:15.540 --> 27:17.496
Basara is scrambling two F-16s.

27:17.540 --> 27:18.848
A thermobaric bomb.

27:18.890 --> 27:20.801
If your team misses
the next comms window,

27:20.850 --> 27:22.670
they're gonna vaporize
the entire structure.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.244
How much time do we have?

27:24.290 --> 27:25.678
Seven minutes.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.878
Down. Get down,
get down!

28:30.620 --> 28:32.042
SONNY: One-eyed
Willy's down.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.091
Sonny, secure the anthrax.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.625
I'd rather be holding spiders
right now.

28:41.670 --> 28:43.058
So, that's jackpot.

28:43.110 --> 28:44.839
That's the jackpot.
Mission complete.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.846
Now we just got to figure out
a way how to communicate it.

28:46.890 --> 28:47.845
What do you mean?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.936
We missed two comm windows.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.720
Basara's not gonna
be happy about that.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.635
They'll have contingencies.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.240
Yes, they will.

28:56.290 --> 28:58.770
Let's go.

29:12.790 --> 29:14.746
ERIC:
Bravo 2, our Saudi counterparts

29:14.790 --> 29:16.963
are requesting
that you exfil immediately.

29:17.010 --> 29:19.183
Havoc Base, Havoc Base,
say again your last?

29:19.230 --> 29:20.788
Saudi command is unwilling

29:20.840 --> 29:22.569
to risk the poisoning
of the aquifer.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.791
Need a status report,
immediately.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.715
They're gonna bomb it.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.273
KAIROS:
Thermobaric, for sure.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.753
Bomb like that will turn
every bit of oxygen down here

29:30.810 --> 29:32.414
into heat as hot as the sun.

29:32.460 --> 29:36.373
It'll boil the water, vaporize
everything, including us.

29:38.420 --> 29:39.728
Keep working.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.726
Yeah.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.553
Havoc,
this is Bravo 2.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.204
Myself, the rest of Bravo,

29:46.260 --> 29:48.160
we're gonna sit tight.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.869
Go ahead and Charlie Mike.

29:49.910 --> 29:52.731
Any chance you can send us down
some shovels and pickaxes?

29:52.790 --> 29:56.009
Bravo 2, tools inbound.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.610
DAVIS:
Bravo 2, tools inbound.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.218
Bravo 2, tools inbound.

30:00.270 --> 30:03.228
Alpha 1, we need some
manual tools down there ASAP.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.352
Anything that can crush rock,
move soil.

30:05.410 --> 30:07.401
Roger that. Moving. Let's go.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.888
Bravo 2, you got five minutes

30:11.940 --> 30:14.408
till your final comm window.Havoc, this is Alpha.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.928
Alpha 1 and 2, headed down
with manual tools.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.856
Bravo 2, radio check.

30:25.910 --> 30:28.686
Bravo 2, radio check.

30:28.730 --> 30:31.255
Radio check, radio check,
Bravo 2.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.386
This right here.Yeah.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.045
Maybe it runs under the cave
into the other side.

30:39.090 --> 30:42.355
Know what? That's a good idea,
Sonny. That's a good idea.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.186
WWRD.

30:44.230 --> 30:46.698
"What Would Ray Do?"

30:53.850 --> 30:56.102
FULL METAL: Damn. I thought
you guys could use some help.

30:56.150 --> 30:58.801
CLAY: Well, you
thought right.

31:00.030 --> 31:02.021
Got it?Thanks.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.599
You getting it?Litt|e bit...

31:09.650 --> 31:13.381
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.

31:13.430 --> 31:15.898
I need at least
three more mikes.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.905
We're making some headway here.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.179
Negative, Bravo 2.
You don't have any more time.

31:25.970 --> 31:28.131
Oh. Hey. Hey!

31:28.190 --> 31:30.055
Hey, you guys,
shut off your lights.

31:31.670 --> 31:33.831
JASON: Keep shoving those
in there, Sonny. Let's go.

31:37.150 --> 31:39.402
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.416
Bravo 1 and Bravo 3 are alive,
they're sending us a signal

31:41.460 --> 31:43.928
over here with some chem lights
underneath this cave-in.

31:43.980 --> 31:45.413
We're gonna proceed
with the dig.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.418
Copy that, Bravo 2.

31:48.470 --> 31:49.983
BASARA: Lights are
a confirmation of nothing.

31:50.030 --> 31:51.372
They could've fallen off a body.

31:51.430 --> 31:54.206
With respect, sir,
these are Tier One operators,

31:54.260 --> 31:55.989
the best soldiers in the world.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.735
Including one
of your own, Kahlil...

31:57.780 --> 32:00.089
I know Kahlil's name.
He is my best friend's son.

32:00.130 --> 32:02.086
I also know I
can't exchange

32:02.130 --> 32:04.086
the lives of a million
for the lives of a few.

32:04.130 --> 32:07.088
I'm sure you understand
these calculations.

32:07.140 --> 32:09.654
In particular,
being CIA.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.132
We proceed with fail-safe,

32:11.190 --> 32:13.055
because we have no choice,
at all.

32:16.190 --> 32:18.101
They're alive.
I need more time.Not possible.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.970
I trusted your gut once.Don't...

32:20.020 --> 32:22.454
UPS Flight 232. I trusted you.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.013
You were right.
If you had been wrong,

32:24.070 --> 32:25.844
my whole career
would have been over.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.845
And if you're wrong here,
my career will be over.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.982
Without di_rect
confirmation,

32:30.030 --> 32:31.986
Basara will not call off
the strike.

32:32.030 --> 32:35.943
The best you can do is buy time.

32:35.990 --> 32:38.129
Make a comms window.

32:49.220 --> 32:50.653
Switch to channel two.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.179
That's gonna take us off
of comms...

33:00.930 --> 33:02.886
ERIC :
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 1.

33:02.930 --> 33:04.978
In the blind, I pass Data.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.191
I say again, I pass Data.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.367
Good copy, Bravo 1.
I copy Data.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.036
Bravo 1 just
passed Data.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.686
Let's wait to see if they make
their next comm window.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.991
Five minutes.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.122
Five minutes.

33:40.010 --> 33:41.443
PILOT:
Target is in range.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.094
Weapon is hot.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.186
Bravo 2, give me a sitrep.

33:45.240 --> 33:48.880
Bravo 2, give me a sitrep.

33:48.930 --> 33:50.329
Come on, come on.

33:50.370 --> 33:51.712
Give me a minute,
Blackburn, all right?

33:51.760 --> 33:53.022
We're trying to hurry. Come on.

33:53.070 --> 33:54.628
ERIC:
Bravo 2, you got a minute left.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.284
You're taking this
down to the wire.

33:56.330 --> 33:57.592
Got a big piece here.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.549
I got this.

34:11.780 --> 34:12.997
Jace!

34:16.480 --> 34:17.822
Shh, shh, shh.
Let's listen, let's listen.

34:24.620 --> 34:25.928
Bravo 2.

34:25.970 --> 34:27.528
Jace!

34:29.630 --> 34:31.586
Bravo 2.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.586
Jackpot. We're good.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.678
Jackpot, jackpot, jackpot.

34:37.680 --> 34:40.638
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass jackpot.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.807
I say again, pass jackpot.
Mission complete.

34:49.300 --> 34:50.642
Copy that, Bravo 1.

34:52.260 --> 34:55.081
Head to exfil.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.180
Good work, guys.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.143
Not a bad idea.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.158
Wasn't my idea.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.328
Mine was about you staying
behind a couple of days.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.541
What do you think?

35:26.600 --> 35:29.763
I think I heard you got married.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.688
So I'm hearing that, uh,

35:36.740 --> 35:38.696
you can do a pretty good
imitation of me, Blackburn.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.389
Oh, what? I've just been
practicing in the mirror.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.919
Is that right?
Go ahead, let me see it.Yeah.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.564
I'm Jason Hayes...I'm Jason Hayes?
I don't say that.

35:43.610 --> 35:45.009
First of all, I don't say
I'm Jason Hayes.

35:45.050 --> 35:46.392
We're gone before sunup.
That's what we do.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.704
Jason Hayes. Harrington.Yeah.

35:48.750 --> 35:50.524
I heard a better Davis.

35:50.580 --> 35:52.184
Yes, sir.

35:58.060 --> 35:59.846
When was this?

36:02.630 --> 36:04.154
VVhen?

36:06.720 --> 36:08.893
Got it.

36:08.940 --> 36:11.591
Aw, nappy-poo
time, huh?

36:11.640 --> 36:12.891
Get some
beauty sleep

36:12.950 --> 36:15.418
before you deeply disappoint
your future in

36:16.910 --> 36:18.810
You know, I could've left you
in that hole, Sonny.

36:18.870 --> 36:20.258
Yeah.

36:20.300 --> 36:24.600
Well, you know, you may be
a dead ringer for Peter Pan,

36:24.660 --> 36:27.003
and Kairos here is liable

36:27.050 --> 36:30.656
to worship Beelzebub,
but I got to say, uh,

36:30.710 --> 36:33.611
you both got big cojones

36:33.660 --> 36:35.446
for staying down there
like that.

36:35.490 --> 36:36.923
Vaya con Dios,bro.Easy, Kairos.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.888
Oh, there they go.

36:41.930 --> 36:43.409
What's up?

36:43.460 --> 36:45.678
Congrats, guys. I heard it got
a little sticlq down there.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.631
It was good.
Yeah?

36:47.680 --> 36:49.500
Yeah, you know what,
to be honest, Ray,

36:49.550 --> 36:52.064
we were a little shorthanded.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.508
Saying you needed
a little help?

36:53.550 --> 36:57.372
I don't know. Anyone from
Green Team worth a damn?

36:57.430 --> 37:00.331
You ever hear the saying "quit
while you're ahead," Jason?

37:00.390 --> 37:03.257
Quit? That's really funny
coming from a guy like you

37:03.300 --> 37:04.517
'cause what I'm hearing

37:04.570 --> 37:07.209
is that you're
window-shopping other teams.

37:16.320 --> 37:19.699
You know what

37:19.750 --> 37:21.752
I'm done shopping.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.331
Hey, what's wrong?

37:38.380 --> 37:40.336
Nothing in the fridge.

37:40.380 --> 37:44.293
Okay, well, that's easy to fix.
What's wrong?

37:44.340 --> 37:47.298
I could use a beer.

37:47.350 --> 37:51.218
I guess I got too used
to the consistency.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.565
I'm fine.You're clearly not.

37:57.620 --> 38:01.829
Didn't you see what
being home did for you?

38:01.880 --> 38:05.441
You were happy.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.049
You were there
for Emma and Mikey.

38:09.110 --> 38:12.068
Emma came home
from Shawboro beaming,

38:12.110 --> 38:15.637
told me she loved
having you there.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.729
She said that?

38:18.770 --> 38:20.374
But now,

38:20.420 --> 38:25.119
two spin-ups, and we're back to,
"Which Jason is coming home?"

38:25.170 --> 38:28.424
Conquering hero?

38:28.480 --> 38:31.517
Or the angry, turbulent soul
who saw something go sideways?

38:31.570 --> 38:34.084
The mission went fine.

38:34.130 --> 38:36.690
What is it then?

38:36.740 --> 38:40.562
We might not be together, but
I know you better than anyone.

38:42.660 --> 38:46.699
We're still friends... right?

38:46.750 --> 38:48.490
Of course, but...

38:48.540 --> 38:50.701
right now, I don't want
to talk about it.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.455
Ijust want my mind off it.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.809
Okay.

38:57.850 --> 39:02.412
Look, I'm gonna go grab HEB's
finest bottle of $12 red,

39:02.470 --> 39:07.078
a rotisserie chicken, and beer.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.987
When you move into your place,
you might want to have a plan

39:10.040 --> 39:12.383
for keeping
your kitchen stocked.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.260
I'm really sorry again
for being late.

39:21.310 --> 39:22.823
Coming from overseas
and only seven minutes late,

39:22.880 --> 39:24.177
uh, you're good.

39:24.230 --> 39:26.482
Where overseas?I'm not really,

39:26.530 --> 39:28.964
not really allowed
to talk about it.

39:29.010 --> 39:30.056
Well, wherever it was,
it looks like

39:30.100 --> 39:32.091
they had you playing
in the dirt.

39:32.150 --> 39:34.106
STELLA:
Mom.

39:34.150 --> 39:37.449
Uh...

39:37.500 --> 39:41.027
No. Uh, yeah, they did,
in a sense, yeah.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.324
Uh, some wine for anyone?

39:45.380 --> 39:48.634
Uh, yeah, white,
uh, French.

39:48.690 --> 39:52.069
WAITER:
OUI monSIeur.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.559
Merci.

39:58.610 --> 40:00.089
You speak
French, Clay.

40:00.130 --> 40:01.688
Clay speaks six languages.

40:01.740 --> 40:06.655
So how does it work
between you two,

40:06.700 --> 40:09.703
with the amount of time
that Clay is gone, fighting?

40:09.750 --> 40:13.356
Do you have any control
with your schedule, Clay?

40:13.410 --> 40:15.355
Um, no, no, not at all.

40:15.410 --> 40:16.832
My-my team and I
are called and we go.

40:16.890 --> 40:17.879
BRETT:
You just go.

40:17.930 --> 40:19.318
Follow the order.

40:19.370 --> 40:21.622
It is the military, sir.

40:23.550 --> 40:24.892
Doesn't sound like
that would make

40:24.940 --> 40:26.669
for a very stable
home life.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.325
Seems unfair to ask that
of a woman,

40:29.380 --> 40:31.336
all that worrying,

40:31.380 --> 40:32.813
fear of losing you
while you're out

40:32.860 --> 40:34.908
following orders
in the field,

40:34.950 --> 40:37.817
doing whatever craven
politicians tell him to do.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.428
Okay, Dad, I think I told you...

40:39.480 --> 40:42.643
Yeah. No, I mean,
I-I do follow orders.

40:42.700 --> 40:45.601
And it's true
there are some

40:45.660 --> 40:47.469
really terrible people
in our government.

40:47.530 --> 40:50.522
But I do this so...

40:50.570 --> 40:53.004
so the people I love,
like Stella,

40:53.050 --> 40:54.449
never have to
see the things

40:54.490 --> 40:57.050
that I've seen _overseas
here on American son.

40:59.410 --> 41:01.628
I don't, I don't plan on
doing this until I'm dead.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.458
You know, I... I want to have
a-a stable future

41:05.500 --> 41:07.548
with your daughter,
I want to have kids.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.286
I want to try and maybe
run for office one day.

41:10.330 --> 41:12.241
You know, see if I...

41:12.290 --> 41:13.541
see ifI can try and unseat

41:13.600 --> 41:15.556
one of those bad eggs
you're talking about

41:15.600 --> 41:17.591
and maybe make
this country

41:17.640 --> 41:20.074
a little bit better.

41:20.120 --> 41:23.738
Y'all can, y'all can
see me as just a pawn.

41:23.780 --> 41:27.216
That's fine, but...

41:27.260 --> 41:31.651
I'm still gonna love Stella,
and that's not gonna change.

41:39.100 --> 41:41.967
All well and good, Clay,

41:42.020 --> 41:44.705
until you come home in a box.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.711
What about Stella then?

41:57.160 --> 42:00.550
JASON:
I don't understand.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.068
You just have one remote
for the TV.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.906
Can't just have one, right

42:04.950 --> 42:06.508
You got to be kidding,
she's knocking.

42:06.560 --> 42:09.563
Alana, why are you knocking?
What're you knocking for?

42:09.610 --> 42:12.306
It's... You forget your keys?

42:12.350 --> 42:15.877
Technology, I don't understand.
Why can't there just be...

42:15.920 --> 42:17.615
PATROLMAN:
Are you Jason Hayes?

42:17.660 --> 42:20.527
What can I help you with?

42:20.580 --> 42:23.538
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this.

42:23.580 --> 42:27.539
It's your wife.
There's been an accident.

42:27.580 --> 42:29.400
She's being'transported

42:29.450 --> 42:31.190
to Ramston
Medical Center...
