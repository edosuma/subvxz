WEBVTT

00:23.565 --> 00:25.442
Inspector Aames, SFPD.

00:26.652 --> 00:27.861
What happened here?

00:27.945 --> 00:31.990
We had a 911 call.
Officers arrived to find a body.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.535
Neither one is talking.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.208
The deceased is Martin Haywood.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.006
He's former SFPD.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.217
He's a suspect
in the murder of Joshua Keith

00:50.300 --> 00:52.886
and Drew Turney in San Francisco.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.686
Not a word.

01:02.896 --> 01:03.981
Cuff him.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.276
Hey, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

01:07.943 --> 01:09.486
He just--

01:09.570 --> 01:11.196
I'll call Mitri.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.241
I'll follow you.
I'm right behind you, Daddy.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.534
I love you.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.091
Aames, what's up?

01:31.175 --> 01:33.969
Martin Haywood is dead. At The Knock.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.554
What the fuck? What happened?

01:35.637 --> 01:37.181
He was stabbed.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.392
Shreve's been taken in for questioning.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.728
Neither he nor Poppy are talking.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.106
Wait, hold on. Poppy was there?
Is she okay?

01:46.190 --> 01:50.277
She's fine. She's-- Well, she's in shock.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.114
All right, look. I'll meet you downtown.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.159
And hey, thanks for the call.

01:59.870 --> 02:00.871
Trini?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.081
What? What's going on?

02:03.165 --> 02:06.376
-Listen, sweetheart. I gotta go out, okay?
-What?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.211
Now, when I leave,
I want you to lock the door

02:08.294 --> 02:10.172
-and make sure you put on the alarm.
-Yeah, I know.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.883
And I'll text your mom
and let her know I had to go.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.384
-Okay.
-You good?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.179
Yeah. I have crew in the morning,
so I'm just going to bed.

02:17.262 --> 02:21.600
Okay. Well, I'll be back shortly.
I'm on my cell phone, okay?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.728
You need anything, obviously you call.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.896
Dad.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.397
Yeah?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.316
Just be careful.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.485
Please.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.535
Baby, I promise, all right?

02:39.618 --> 02:42.412
Come here. I promise.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.915
-I love you.
-I love you too.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.876
Now you lock that door.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.713
-Lock the door now, please.
-Okay, I'm coming.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.642
Hey. You wanna tell me what happened?

03:04.309 --> 03:07.104
You or official you?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.106
I'm always a cop, Pop.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.026
I'm always my father's daughter.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.612
I'll wait till his lawyer gets here.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.281
All right.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.411
But if Martin Haywood was all the way
out in Oakland at your family's bar,

03:23.203 --> 03:26.206
I am going to assume he wasn't there
to spread the word of God.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.256
-Hey.
-Watch it, man.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.885
-Give us a minute?
-Yeah.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.637
Come on. Let's talk outside.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.722
Hey.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.308
You all right?

03:47.978 --> 03:49.229
He came at me.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.939
Pinned me down.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.360
Then Daddy came from out of nowhere
and picked up the knife that I dropped.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.404
He was definitely coming after you.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.115
He would have killed me and Daddy both.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.701
I know it. He reached for his gun.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.663
You can work that, right?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.081
I can work the fuck out of that.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.292
This was self-defense.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.086
Let me get in there and see what I can do.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.505
Everything will be fine.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.301
-It's gonna be all right.
-Officer Sanchez,

04:19.384 --> 04:20.552
please report to the front desk.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.263
Officer Sanchez,
please report to the front desk.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.640
There's Daddy.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.315
Wait. What's going on?

04:33.398 --> 04:34.399
Shit.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.945
I thought this might happen.
It's called a probable cause arrest.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.406
They can hold him for 48 hours.
Even on Thursdays, it's--

04:41.490 --> 04:45.661
Thursday's the worst day to be detained.
He might not see a judge until Tuesday.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.539
So is he being transferred to Santa Rita?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.166
-You know it.
-Fuck.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.712
That's some bullshit.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.590
And it has nothing to do
with the case itself.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.343
None of you have fans,
but you have a lot of enemies.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.880
Anything we can use to help Daddy?
Mitri's already called twice.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.049
Not yet. But Aames came through

06:22.591 --> 06:24.384
with the Haywood phone records
and cell towers.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.220
Look at this.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.639
He followed you here, across the bridge.

06:28.722 --> 06:32.226
And it looks like he was on our tail
after we left his house.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.394
He hunted me.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.146
Pop,

06:36.730 --> 06:39.399
I found tower pings that put him in range

06:39.483 --> 06:42.110
of Joshua and Drew's murders the night of.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.906
But it's too clean.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.117
Something's missing.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.957
That's Shelter's main line,
the morning after the murders.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.045
Why the hell would he call Shelter?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.005
What?

07:03.674 --> 07:05.342
-Micah.
-Shit.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.636
She always seemed shady to me, Pop.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.347
And that would explain the Shelter
products at Haywood's house.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.933
I need you to confirm he called Micah.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.352
We can't just accuse.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.479
Even better,
if we knew what they talked about.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.564
All right.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.775
It would help to have eyes and ears
inside the place,

07:21.859 --> 07:24.111
-but we'll see if Markus still has an in.
-Okay.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.287
-Hey.
-Just spoke to Lillian.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.623
Daddy called from Santa Rita this morning.
He's fine.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.750
She's trying to get his meds to him.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.879
I took the day off.
Let me know what you need me to do.

07:43.213 --> 07:47.050
Well, I'm going to see Daddy later.
You want to come with me?

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
No.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.305
Cydie.

07:51.388 --> 07:56.059
No. There is no part of me
that wants to see Daddy like that.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.979
I will see him when he comes home.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.369
You're clear. Go.

08:15.621 --> 08:16.622
Next.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.255
Proceed to the counter.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.684
What are you doing here?

08:41.104 --> 08:42.356
I came to see Shreve.

08:45.317 --> 08:48.862
Look, no matter what's happening between
you and I, you know I still love him.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.822
I don't know you at all.

08:52.950 --> 08:53.951
Yes, you do.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.619
Next.

08:57.538 --> 09:01.375
Martin Haywood… Did he kill Joshua?

09:01.458 --> 09:02.668
Next.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.601
Right this way.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.774
I hate seeing you in here.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.651
I'd stay here if it means saving you.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.528
Don't say that, Daddy.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.614
Micah came to see me.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.616
I saw her.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.787
Let her tell her story.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.458
-I don't trust her.
-Not for her. For you.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.086
See what she has to say.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.713
You don't have to forgive her.

09:47.796 --> 09:52.259
You don't have to understand her
or trust her, but you…

09:52.342 --> 09:54.261
you do have to put this all to bed.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.932
I don't wanna open a door
for her to come back through.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.101
Listen to me, baby girl.

10:01.185 --> 10:04.646
I've made mistakes.
Some big, some small. And so have you.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.401
But you've dragged them behind you
your whole life.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.738
Everything you've done has been
because of the year I went to jail.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.031
The year I abandoned you.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.407
-Daddy.
-Uh-uh-uh. Just…

10:20.537 --> 10:23.457
Killing that man, saving you.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.836
I would kill him a million times
if it would help ease some of your pain.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.297
So I need you to ask yourself,

10:31.632 --> 10:34.760
what in Micah's life made her who she is?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.472
If you don't hear what she has to say,

10:38.555 --> 10:41.225
it'll be the new thing
that you carry with you.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.603
Don't replace one burden for another.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.357
Do you feel me?

10:54.947 --> 10:56.740
God, I love you.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.492
Hey, no touching.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.915
Hey, Shae. This is Markus Killebrew.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.708
Hey, Markus. How you holding up?

11:06.792 --> 11:09.127
Listen, I really need
your help with something.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.212
Okay.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.423
A call came in
the day after Josh and Drew were killed.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.468
8:07 in the morning.
To Shelter's main line.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.429
I need to know where you sent that call,
you understand?

11:19.513 --> 11:21.014
Okay, 8:07 in the morning.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.267
-Let me see what I can do.
-Thank you.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.810
Talk soon.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.816
He didn't deserve this.

11:30.899 --> 11:35.487
A lie Micah told long before
she even met him led to his death.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.534
There's no satisfaction in the answers
if she doesn't admit to that.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.870
Or her involvement.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.541
A single deception destroyed six lives.

11:48.250 --> 11:52.171
Josh, Drew, Rose, Holt, Ramon…

11:53.839 --> 11:56.258
Even that lunatic, Martin Haywood.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.219
Seven…

12:00.387 --> 12:02.681
if we don't get my father out of jail.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.892
Eight, if you include her own.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.727
Shelter's struggling.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.438
And if she's the alley cat
I believe her to be…

12:09.813 --> 12:12.774
...that leaves her
with one of her nine lives.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.279
I want her to admit to her lies.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.948
I wanna hear her own it.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.358
This is what you reap, Micah.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.485
What do you want, Poppy?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.573
Why did you steal Rose's life?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.367
You built your empire on her back.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.537
You took her voice. Erased her name.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.913
You're such a hypocrite.

13:49.997 --> 13:54.626
You-- You wanna talk about erasing names?
What about you?

13:55.377 --> 14:00.549
You moved to New York and shed any link
to your roots, to your family.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.681
Why did you drop the name Scoville
when you became a journalist?

14:07.764 --> 14:10.851
I took Parnell to feel close to my mother.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.645
Poppy Parnell.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.357
Everyone takes a back seat to that name.

14:17.441 --> 14:18.817
That's a lie.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.027
Ingram was right.

14:20.110 --> 14:24.364
He knew you could never fully
commit to him. Only to yourself.

14:25.449 --> 14:26.950
That's why you're alone.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.872
Just like me.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.498
Wow.

14:34.875 --> 14:38.504
Rose told me you'd fight
like a trapped animal if you got cornered.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.548
Who else is gonna do it for me?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.736
Well, not everything was a lie.

15:04.905 --> 15:05.906
I had no family.

15:05.989 --> 15:10.202
My blood family abandoned me.

15:11.662 --> 15:13.497
But Shreve, he was…

15:15.624 --> 15:17.584
a father to me.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.421
And you, my sister.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.928
I felt safe with you guys.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.688
Do you have any idea
what that meant to me?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.280
Just accepted me for me.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.123
I thought we found family in each other.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.921
But, you know,
I've been chasing that my whole life.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.508
I'm just searching everywhere to…

16:11.138 --> 16:12.347
find that.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.686
Stop trying to manipulate me.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.735
There's that mask again.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.488
-I don't have a mask.
-Yeah, you do.

16:29.615 --> 16:31.408
I saw it the first time in New York

16:31.491 --> 16:35.829
when I spent every last dollar of mine
trying to find you.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.040
When you gave me your manuscript.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.376
Rose's manuscript.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.296
I saw you with your new friends.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.760
You thought they were better than me.
Better than you.

16:50.969 --> 16:55.098
With your cheap shoes
and your cheap accent. Your history.

16:55.766 --> 16:58.435
You had inferiority written all over you,

16:58.519 --> 17:00.979
and you were embarrassed of me.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.105
You caught me off guard.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.942
You only remembered that you loved me
when your friends left.

17:05.025 --> 17:09.905
I saw the real you that day. The climber.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.660
Changing colors,
depending on who you were with.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.079
A different face for everybody.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.040
But I still loved you.

17:23.585 --> 17:25.796
You have no idea

17:26.463 --> 17:28.339
what it was like for me in that world.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.051
No idea.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.430
And you're right.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.559
We are alike.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.311
We're survivors.

17:42.813 --> 17:47.192
But unlike you, I survived
without tearing down everyone around me.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.695
You use people, Micah.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.240
Just like you used Martin Haywood.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.618
Excuse me?

17:56.702 --> 17:59.705
He called the Shelter main line
the morning after the murders.

18:00.289 --> 18:03.125
What are you talking about? I was home.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.545
You used Martin Haywood to kill Josh
to protect yourself.

18:06.628 --> 18:11.508
You still think
I had something to do with this?

18:14.511 --> 18:16.180
Oh, my God.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.395
That you think I could hurt him.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.963
You still suspect me.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.969
I don't want to. But I do.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.642
You were at my wedding.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.520
You were at mine.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.406
I'll give you all the answers you want.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.621
And you can record it.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.832
We can set it all straight.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.889
Hey. I just heard back from Shae.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.016
She sent over the phone records
from Shelter.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.643
Why don't you take a look at your text?

19:49.606 --> 19:52.109
A full confession
would make all our lives easier.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.403
But yeah, I can work with this.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.198
Hey, Markus,
let me-- let me call you back.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.366
All right, bet.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.873
What the fuck are you looking at?

20:11.420 --> 20:16.008
So, Micah. Who were you before we met?

20:16.633 --> 20:17.968
Where did it all start?

20:18.886 --> 20:21.847
My mother, Fawn. That was her name.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.098
Where is she?

20:23.182 --> 20:25.434
Dead. Five years ago.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.853
She was alive all this time?

20:29.313 --> 20:31.773
If you can call it that.

20:32.774 --> 20:37.237
I hadn't seen her or heard from her
for over 15 years.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.992
They found her body
out near Russian River.

20:42.784 --> 20:46.330
Natural causes,
after years of abusing herself with drugs.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.417
Just went to sleep in the redwoods,
under a tree.

20:51.710 --> 20:52.794
They found…

20:53.462 --> 20:57.090
the author photo from Discard
tucked into her bra.

20:57.174 --> 20:59.134
And she had written "my daughter" on it.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.595
Police tracked me down
through my publisher.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.348
I'm sorry.

21:06.183 --> 21:07.559
And your father?

21:08.477 --> 21:09.895
Could have been anyone.

21:10.896 --> 21:12.523
Fawn used to love the Greek myths.

21:12.606 --> 21:16.276
She read them to me. One of my only
fond memories of being with her.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.154
And when I would ask about my father,
she would say,

21:20.113 --> 21:23.158
"Goddesses didn't need men
to have daughters."

21:25.869 --> 21:28.413
-Did you run away from her?
-I had to.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.707
I knew I had to get away,
even as a little kid.

21:30.791 --> 21:35.420
I mean, I tried it in spurts to see
if she noticed my absences getting longer,

21:35.504 --> 21:37.089
but she-- she didn't.

21:37.923 --> 21:42.177
I was alone in an abandoned building
near the post office in West Oakland.

21:42.261 --> 21:46.223
And I hid in a crawl space to sleep.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.184
The last time she came back,
she came back for me.

21:49.268 --> 21:51.103
She had this guy with her.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.607
And I ran before I could find out
what that meant for me.

21:55.691 --> 21:57.568
It was not hard to guess.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.405
Where'd you go?

22:01.488 --> 22:04.032
I was at Bushrod Park.
I'd been sleeping there.

22:05.117 --> 22:08.078
And I saw you and your sisters
with Shreve.

22:09.913 --> 22:14.084
And this dog got off a leash,
and he made a beeline right for you,

22:14.168 --> 22:15.711
and I was on the jungle gym.

22:16.753 --> 22:20.591
Shreve saw the dog, and he tossed
the three of you on that chain-link fence

22:20.674 --> 22:22.551
and told you to keep climbing to the top.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.095
Yelling, like, "Keep climbing
and get to the top, out of reach."

22:25.179 --> 22:26.555
I remember that.

22:26.638 --> 22:28.974
I've never forgotten it.

22:31.768 --> 22:35.689
I had just run from someone
who didn't know how to protect me,

22:36.857 --> 22:41.111
and I saw that his instinct wasn't
for himself, but for you three girls.

22:43.697 --> 22:44.990
I wanted that.

22:46.617 --> 22:50.037
Wanted to feel protected. Safe.

22:55.918 --> 22:57.669
For a while, I did.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.091
With Joshua.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.582
So how's this gonna go?

23:45.259 --> 23:47.553
You know, it's lucky
I-- I just washed my hands.

24:07.656 --> 24:08.657
Hey, T.

24:10.284 --> 24:11.285
Hey.

24:14.413 --> 24:15.789
Wait. What are you doing here?

24:15.873 --> 24:17.416
Thought I'd surprise you.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.460
Here. Let me take that.
My cousins, they just got in from Atlanta.

24:20.544 --> 24:22.713
Haven't seen them in a while.
Gonna show them around town.

24:23.380 --> 24:26.008
-Want to come?
-Yeah, yeah. I'd love to.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.510
My-- My parents won't be home
for a couple of hours. So…

24:28.594 --> 24:30.012
Cool.

24:31.763 --> 24:34.308
-That them?
-Yeah, that's them.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.227
Hi.

24:39.104 --> 24:42.399
-So, now I get to meet your family.
-Yeah, you do.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.631
-Hey.
-Hey, you got a sec?

25:05.714 --> 25:09.009
-Yeah. Micah just left.
-Where are you?

25:09.092 --> 25:10.093
The Orpheum.

25:10.177 --> 25:11.553
I just interviewed her.

25:11.637 --> 25:14.431
-Well, I got the phone logs from Shelter.
-And?

25:14.515 --> 25:16.475
Well, turns out

25:16.558 --> 25:21.063
Martin Haywood called Ivy Abbott's phone
the morning after the murders.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.981
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

25:23.065 --> 25:27.027
Check this out.
I compared Martin's phone records

25:27.110 --> 25:30.572
with Ivy's,
and it shows Haywood and Ivy together

25:30.656 --> 25:34.868
at a warehouse in Vallejo the morning
that Joshua and Drew were killed.

25:34.952 --> 25:37.162
If this is true,
then it could clear Micah.

25:37.246 --> 25:38.539
Just hang on.

25:38.622 --> 25:41.583
We still need the proof that they actually
planned the murders together.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.252
If Ivy stole the code

25:43.335 --> 25:45.754
to Josh's lockbox,
she could have given him Josh's gun.

25:46.672 --> 25:47.714
Yeah.

25:47.798 --> 25:50.425
Look.
Text me the address to the warehouse.

25:50.509 --> 25:51.510
I'll ask Noa

25:51.593 --> 25:53.637
to see if she can find
some security footage.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.514
Okay, cool.
Have her meet us at the theater.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.225
-I'm on my way to you. See you soon.
-Okay.

26:02.521 --> 26:03.730
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:03.814 --> 26:08.026
You're not gonna believe this.
Dead to rights. Martin Haywood.

26:08.735 --> 26:12.865
On camera at the warehouse in Vallejo.
And look who's with him.

26:15.158 --> 26:18.078
Damn, those motherfuckers.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.497
She murdered my friend.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.001
I need to be there when she's arrested.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.305
Josh was my friend…

26:38.056 --> 26:39.266
…and I loved him.

26:40.434 --> 26:41.685
What are you talking about?

26:44.563 --> 26:47.524
Ivy Abbott, you're under arrest

26:47.608 --> 26:50.235
for the murders of Joshua Keith
and Drew Turney.

26:50.319 --> 26:53.238
-Hands behind your back, ma'am.
-You have the right to remain silent.

26:53.322 --> 26:56.533
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.635
What's going on?

27:14.718 --> 27:17.763
Ivy, what's happening?

27:20.140 --> 27:21.141
What?

27:27.022 --> 27:28.190
What?

27:29.942 --> 27:31.109
Micah.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.613
What's happening?

27:42.079 --> 27:45.582
So, we found footage
of Ivy meeting with Martin Haywood

27:45.666 --> 27:48.043
the morning of your husband's murder.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.462
Now, she's not saying a word.

27:50.546 --> 27:52.881
She wants to speak to you first.

27:52.965 --> 27:55.759
I don't want to hear
anything she has to say.

27:56.844 --> 28:01.431
Micah, the cleanest way to a conviction
is a confession.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.644
You can do this, Micah.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.188
For Josh.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.706
I just want to know why.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.170
You left me no choice.

29:18.008 --> 29:22.095
You see, Rose told Josh everything.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.307
And Josh wasn't comfortable living a lie.

29:33.190 --> 29:38.237
Exposing the truth about you would
have destroyed you, destroyed Shelter.

29:39.947 --> 29:41.865
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.786
Haywood had his own bone to pick
with Joshua

29:45.869 --> 29:48.413
over the fallout from their documentary.

29:50.082 --> 29:51.875
So it wasn't hard to convince him.

29:53.043 --> 29:54.419
Okay.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.929
I had spent years
architecting Shelter's brand.

30:04.721 --> 30:09.810
Pouring my own money and everything
that I had into making it a success.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.817
Josh arrived right on time.

30:17.609 --> 30:18.610
Alone.

30:20.028 --> 30:22.906
This was my chance to change the future.

30:23.490 --> 30:26.368
To write myself into the story of Shelter.

30:30.414 --> 30:33.208
And I wanted it done the right way.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.137
The plan was perfect.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.349
The combination to the lockbox,
Josh's gun.

30:53.979 --> 30:55.689
We had it all worked out.

31:03.989 --> 31:05.991
But there was one thing
we didn't anticipate.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.242
Hey.

31:10.787 --> 31:12.289
Shit.

31:29.932 --> 31:31.350
Oh, fuck.

31:41.235 --> 31:43.278
You did all that to protect me?

31:46.657 --> 31:48.575
To protect Shelter?

31:48.659 --> 31:49.660
You're unbelievable.

31:55.457 --> 31:59.628
You still can't see me.

32:04.842 --> 32:07.928
I considered calling it off
when you decided to go to dinner

32:08.011 --> 32:09.555
with Poppy.

32:12.224 --> 32:14.726
Because I wanted you to be there.

32:20.399 --> 32:22.860
We were going to kill Josh,

32:23.944 --> 32:25.988
and then we were going to kill you.

32:36.164 --> 32:39.209
It was just supposed to be
just you and me together.

32:42.171 --> 32:45.674
God, when it was just the two of us,
there was really nothing we couldn't do.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.262
Because I believed…

32:55.184 --> 32:57.519
I believed everything that you said.

32:59.688 --> 33:01.190
I trusted you.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.861
I gave everything to you.

33:09.573 --> 33:12.534
Gave you my money. Gave you my time.

33:12.618 --> 33:15.704
I gave you my life.

33:18.624 --> 33:20.918
I bled for you.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.755
I loved you.

33:29.051 --> 33:31.803
I loved you more than
I've loved anyone in my whole life.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.809
God, Josh could never understand that.
He could never.

33:39.311 --> 33:43.524
Killing you would have saved you.

33:45.317 --> 33:47.361
Would have turned you into a martyr.

33:56.245 --> 33:59.373
You know what? You don't deserve Shelter.

33:59.456 --> 34:02.835
And you don't deserve
all the love that we gave to you.

34:02.918 --> 34:07.047
You don't deserve the devotion
and the respect that we gave to you.

34:07.130 --> 34:10.759
'Cause you're a con artist.
Your lies are what led us here.

34:10.842 --> 34:13.344
And I hope you are left with nothing!

34:13.428 --> 34:15.597
And I hope you're left with no one!

34:16.223 --> 34:17.224
No one!

34:18.641 --> 34:19.976
Nobody!

34:23.355 --> 34:25.858
I am the cornerstone of my life.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.360
I can rebuild, I can start fresh.

34:28.443 --> 34:30.487
Brick by brick. Brick by brick.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.322
From the chaos of my grief.

34:33.407 --> 34:35.617
Brick by brick. Brick by brick.

34:35.701 --> 34:39.788
Brick by brick. Brick by brick.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.123
Micah?

35:01.310 --> 35:02.477
Micah.

35:05.022 --> 35:06.773
You tried to warn me.

35:09.109 --> 35:11.820
That we'd find out
more than we'd want to know.

35:13.363 --> 35:17.242
And now, with the recording,
I guess, so will the whole world.

35:17.868 --> 35:18.869
Look…

35:19.703 --> 35:24.583
no child should ever have to endure
what you did.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.670
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.674
But Rose was a discard, just like you.

35:34.051 --> 35:35.886
If I let this go,

35:35.969 --> 35:40.098
it means your pain
was more important than hers.

35:43.143 --> 35:44.686
That can't be.

35:47.189 --> 35:48.565
I know.

35:52.528 --> 35:56.240
"When you find that patch of pavement
in the morning sun

35:57.241 --> 36:01.245
and a shadow passes
as someone has to step around you…"

36:01.328 --> 36:05.290
"…at least you know you still exist."

36:05.999 --> 36:09.169
Those are the first lines of Discard.

36:09.253 --> 36:11.463
Rose's lines.

36:12.965 --> 36:13.966
I love you.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.556
And I always will.

36:28.897 --> 36:31.108
I didn't know how to do it any other way.

36:40.409 --> 36:42.327
I love you too.

37:24.786 --> 37:28.332
When we think about things
that get passed down from generations,

37:28.957 --> 37:31.585
we often think of physical traits.

37:31.668 --> 37:36.965
You may have your mother's eyes
or your father's smile.

37:37.883 --> 37:40.469
Maybe we think of family heirlooms.

37:40.552 --> 37:44.473
Treasured items,
collected and passed down over time.

37:45.807 --> 37:47.351
But we can also

37:48.352 --> 37:50.395
inherit their pain.

37:51.230 --> 37:52.940
Their mistakes.

37:54.066 --> 37:55.067
Their trauma.

37:55.943 --> 38:01.615
And the pain of the past often writes
our future before we've even realized how.

38:01.698 --> 38:05.244
Like some silent inexorable punishment.

38:06.286 --> 38:10.290
I've talked about the year
that has defined my whole life.

38:10.374 --> 38:12.167
My lost year.

38:12.876 --> 38:17.881
I've been alive three times past that,
and here it is.

38:18.799 --> 38:21.760
Still, my choices,

38:22.386 --> 38:26.390
the consequences for my choices.

38:28.225 --> 38:32.938
The consequences of the murders
have had far-reaching ripples.

38:33.522 --> 38:35.983
Shelter has been shuttered.

38:36.859 --> 38:41.905
And the light of the truth
has been let into its dark corners.

38:42.990 --> 38:45.325
Where Micah Keith will go from here,

38:46.201 --> 38:48.078
only time will tell.

38:48.704 --> 38:53.542
But I'd venture to guess
that the truth will set her free.

38:54.334 --> 38:58.255
We are people of substance.

38:58.922 --> 39:01.008
Of flesh and bone.

39:01.675 --> 39:04.261
Fiber and liquids.

39:05.262 --> 39:10.267
We are only invisible
when people refuse to see us.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.019
And I'll add,

39:13.353 --> 39:16.690
when we refuse to see ourselves.

39:18.483 --> 39:23.989
Unfortunately, the world is filled
with invisible souls.

39:26.408 --> 39:31.038
Rose Gil was invisible her entire life.

39:31.997 --> 39:34.791
We now know that it was her words,

39:34.875 --> 39:39.171
her experiences that inspired thousands.

39:39.254 --> 39:42.007
Words that Micah claimed as her own.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.886
Why did you take Rose's journals?

39:47.387 --> 39:49.264
When Rose and Holt got caught,

39:49.848 --> 39:52.935
I took the backpack to keep it for her.
To keep it with me.

39:53.602 --> 39:58.065
And when I looked inside, I found
all her writings, her drawings, her life.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.859
I knew-- I knew it was special.
I could feel it.

40:02.069 --> 40:05.239
And I knew it was my way out.

40:05.781 --> 40:07.115
But it was a lie.

40:08.158 --> 40:11.036
I never expected the book
to shake the world.

40:14.498 --> 40:16.625
It grew beyond anything I ever imagined.

40:18.418 --> 40:23.006
But the only way I could make up
for what I've done to Rose,

40:23.090 --> 40:25.008
to reconcile the theft, was to do good.

40:25.092 --> 40:27.469
And I did.
I helped more people than I hurt.

40:27.553 --> 40:28.846
That's not enough, Micah.

40:28.929 --> 40:30.806
It has to be.

40:35.811 --> 40:38.188
But now the world knows Rose Gil's name.

40:38.272 --> 40:42.150
She told me, in her own words,
what it meant.

40:43.652 --> 40:46.280
Micah returned all my original journals.

40:47.030 --> 40:50.492
It was like reuniting with an old friend.

40:51.368 --> 40:53.954
Seeing how I used to be,
how far I've come.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.001
I can breathe again.

41:00.169 --> 41:02.212
The truth is known.

41:03.797 --> 41:05.299
And so am I.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.969
I'll probably never see her again,

41:09.052 --> 41:11.972
but we're always linked

41:12.890 --> 41:14.433
by the story

41:15.475 --> 41:17.519
and what we survived as kids.

41:22.649 --> 41:24.693
Micah Keith, on the other hand,

41:25.444 --> 41:28.530
was never seen for who she truly was.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.700
Not by her devoted fans…

41:33.994 --> 41:36.079
or even her closest friend.

42:40.644 --> 42:45.065
But the stories we tell
about ourselves carry consequences.

42:45.148 --> 42:49.194
For those of us
privileged enough to have a platform,

42:49.862 --> 42:52.781
why waste our voices on a myth?

44:33.215 --> 44:35.676
I spent my life

44:36.426 --> 44:39.471
crafting the image of Poppy Parnell.

44:40.138 --> 44:42.808
I chose a name that linked me to my mother

44:42.891 --> 44:47.521
and differentiated me
from the family that raised me.

44:48.272 --> 44:49.606
The Scovilles.

44:51.483 --> 44:52.901
But my own myth

44:53.986 --> 44:56.071
no longer serves me.

44:57.114 --> 44:58.699
The further I ran,

44:59.283 --> 45:02.369
the further I got from my own truth.

45:06.623 --> 45:09.585
I let pain define me.

45:10.210 --> 45:13.547
But now I'm going home.

46:36.588 --> 46:39.758
I'm following my heart back to Oakland.

46:39.842 --> 46:44.012
To a family who will always ride with me.

46:44.096 --> 46:48.767
And I am free to ride with them.

46:50.185 --> 46:51.979
As Ellison wrote,

46:53.564 --> 46:56.441
"When I discover who I am,

46:57.568 --> 46:59.361
I'll be free."

47:01.238 --> 47:02.322
Those words

47:02.990 --> 47:05.617
teach me how to go home again.

47:07.202 --> 47:08.996
How to see myself.

47:10.038 --> 47:12.124
And how to be visible

47:12.833 --> 47:15.252
to those who truly matter.

47:17.171 --> 47:20.966
So, thank you for listening.

47:23.927 --> 47:26.930
I am Poppy Scoville,

47:28.348 --> 47:31.977
and I'd like you to reconsider.
