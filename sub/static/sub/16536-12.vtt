WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:03.963
<i>- Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>
- Gun!

00:04.088 --> 00:06.090
No!

00:07.550 --> 00:09.468
Several bullet
fragments lodged in your chest.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.554
We need to operate
as soon as possible.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.306
Sir, you're now the acting president
of the United States.

00:14.432 --> 00:15.975
They found the shooter.
They're waiting for you at Command Ops.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.102
President Kirkman would have
wanted to take him alive.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.229
That's a mistake.
Give the order. Shoot to kill.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.647
<i>Execute.</i>

00:21.772 --> 00:23.566
<i>Target neutralized.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:25.151
Mr. Atwood, your son will be safe

00:25.276 --> 00:27.486
as long as you do
everything I tell you to do.

00:27.611 --> 00:31.407
Hannah Wells? That's who they have
in custody? Find out what she knows.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.827
And if the president wants answers,
I'll give them to one person.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.412
The president himself.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.872
Clear the floor!

00:39.415 --> 00:40.916
I understand
you have some things

00:41.042 --> 00:42.918
you want to tell me
about Peter MacLeish.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.962
Yes, sir. I do.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.844
MacLeish was hiding
in a bomb shelter?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.637
Moments before the explosion,

00:53.763 --> 00:56.974
there was a 34-second gap
in the broadcast feed.

00:57.099 --> 00:59.602
He knew exactly
when to leave his seat.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.105
He was involved
from the very beginning.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.482
What a monster.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.359
The man who shot him,
MacLeish knew him?

01:07.485 --> 01:09.445
Yes. They served together
in Afghanistan.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.365
Former CIA operative Nestor Lozano,
code name "Catalan."

01:13.491 --> 01:17.495
Sir, I don't have all the pieces,
but I did feel I had enough to go

01:17.620 --> 01:19.663
to Speaker Hookstraten
before MacLeish was confirmed.

01:19.789 --> 01:22.625
Damn right you did.
What exactly happened there?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.127
I was attacked on the way
to the hearing.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.879
I was on my way to meet
Speaker Hookstraten

01:27.004 --> 01:28.172
at the Rayburn Building.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.384
Someone T-boned my car,
tried to strangle me.

01:32.510 --> 01:35.888
I got away,
but he took my file.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.683
Luckily, Agent Ritter was able to secure
another copy from the agency.

01:40.476 --> 01:42.686
I feel so stupid.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.022
MacLeish fooled everyone, sir.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.983
Not her. She saw right through him.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.738
Mr. Vice President.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.074
- Seth, I thought you'd be at the hospital.
- Just got back.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.408
- How is he?
- Recovering rapidly.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.245
The president should be back
in the residence by the end of the week.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.371
Great news.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.914
Speaking of news, sir,
we noticed your team...

02:02.039 --> 02:04.416
uh, that your team scheduled
a press conference for later today.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.418
Yeah, I think the people
need reassurance

02:06.544 --> 02:08.419
that their country remains
in capable hands

02:08.545 --> 02:11.423
with President Kirkman in charge.
- It's an admirable sentiment.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.217
Just, uh, curious about the timing.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.010
Perhaps we could take
a look at your remarks.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.304
It's handled.
Thank you, Seth. Thank you.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.019
So, MacLeish was working with Al-Sakar.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.650
Al-Sakar isn't behind the bombing.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.569
I beg your pardon?

02:33.028 --> 02:35.114
When I interviewed Majid Nassar,
he told me

02:35.239 --> 02:37.449
that he took responsibility
for the attack

02:37.575 --> 02:39.743
in order to divert us
from the real conspirators.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.456
Well, if it wasn't Al-Sakar--

02:44.582 --> 02:46.625
I mean, MacLeish couldn't have
done this on his own.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.586
- Who is he working with?
- We don't know yet.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.421
Charles Langdon is involved.

02:51.172 --> 02:54.717
President Richmond's Chief of Staff?
I thought he died in the bombing.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.136
I can personally verify
that he survived the explosion.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.764
I saw him myself.
In fact, he's hiding out in some--

03:01.515 --> 03:03.100
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.436
Agent Wells, this is my wife, Alex.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.813
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ma'am.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.273
Please continue.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.320
Respectfully, sir, this information
is only for you and your security team.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.488
- Agent Wells, I promise you--
- No, no, it's okay, Tom.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.032
I'll come back.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.786
I assure you that wasn't necessary.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.413
- Mike, please--
- I'm sorry, Mr. President,

03:24.538 --> 03:26.207
but I have to agree
with Agent Wells.

03:27.124 --> 03:29.251
The First Lady isn't a part
of your security team.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.920
She doesn't have
code-word clearance.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.630
She knows about
the threat assessment--

03:32.755 --> 03:34.048
And that was a mistake, sir.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.508
You didn't say that at the time.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.093
I'm saying it now.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.763
Mr. President,
we're dealing with a conspiracy

03:40.888 --> 03:44.808
that's so deep, so dangerous
that nobody's safe.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.478
And not only is sharing information

03:47.603 --> 03:50.439
with outside personnel
a threat to national security.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.108
It also puts the people
you confide in at risk.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.445
Sir, you need to tighten your circle.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.785
Okay.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.496
What do we do now?

04:05.621 --> 04:07.915
I want MacLeish in custody
as soon as possible.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.293
Ordinarily, I'd say we consult
with the Attorney General.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.045
But we don't have
an Attorney General.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.714
I know someone we can trust.
Can I reach out to him?

04:15.839 --> 04:16.798
Okay, good.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.216
I've got an office you could use.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.636
We can get you in and out
through covert access

04:20.761 --> 04:23.555
and maintain your cover story
you're still in police custody.

04:23.681 --> 04:26.058
- You need to stay in the shadows.
- Okay.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.645
I want you to come back to me
with a plan on how to get MacLeish.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.856
The son of a bitch is gonna pay.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.825
You can't stop him?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.995
The vice president has the authority
to schedule his own press conferences.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.372
Hey, what's this about
a MacLeish press conference?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.040
The vice president
has the authority to schedule

04:50.165 --> 04:52.209
- his own press --
- I understand that, but why now?

04:52.334 --> 04:53.919
You'd have to take that up
with MacLeish.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.755
I'd like to, but I have a laundry
list of action items from POTUS.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.841
- When did you speak to him?
- About an hour ago.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.677
No, he didn't say why you were
looking into the phone calls I made

05:01.802 --> 05:05.222
2 1/2 years ago. And, frankly, I didn't
think it was the right time to ask.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.559
- Keep me posted, all right?
- Am I missing something here?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.146
Anyone?

05:13.647 --> 05:14.773
Why me?

05:14.898 --> 05:16.442
Because you're a former U.S. attorney.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.943
You're a man of absolute integrity.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.030
And right now, the president needs
a legal advisor who's above reproach.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.284
What you're asking is just
a little above my pay grade.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.244
Well, it's above
all of our pay grades.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.080
What we're talking about
is completely unprecedented.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.082
But the president needs counsel,

05:32.207 --> 05:35.544
and I might have already told him
that we can count on you.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.048
So... can we?

05:40.924 --> 05:44.053
Well, when you sweet-talk a guy
like that, how can I refuse?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.974
Through these past weeks,
President Kirkman

05:49.099 --> 05:52.478
has shown himself
to be a leader we can trust,

05:52.603 --> 05:54.646
a leader who has
the virtue and strength

05:54.772 --> 05:58.317
to keep this nation united,
and I couldn't be more thrilled

05:58.442 --> 06:00.652
<i>to be welcoming him back
to the helm.</i>

06:00.778 --> 06:03.655
<i>The assassination attempt
and the Capitol bombing</i>

06:03.781 --> 06:06.158
<i>were attacks
on the very foundations</i>

06:06.283 --> 06:08.827
<i>of this democratic republic,
and they failed...</i>

06:08.952 --> 06:11.830
- Did you know about this?
- Seth gave me a heads-up.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.123
<i>- ...time and time again...</i>
- Wow...

06:13.248 --> 06:15.918
He's got some nerve going
out on his own like that.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.338
<i>...woven together
through common values.</i>

06:19.463 --> 06:21.965
<i>I'd like to thank the brave
law-enforcement officers</i>

06:22.091 --> 06:23.133
<i>who brought the--</i>

06:26.136 --> 06:27.846
I need to go back
to the White House.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.182
Yeah, well, you'll be out
of here soon enough.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.518
No. I mean now.
I can't just sit here.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.354
Tom, you just got shot.
You are lucky to be alive.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.523
Alex, the people that are behind this
are still out there.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.984
There's a traitor in the White House. I'm
not gonna find them by just sitting here.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.364
Okay, Tom,
I need to tell you something.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.782
What?

06:47.491 --> 06:50.869
Minutes before you got shot,
Emily found out that it was Aaron

06:50.994 --> 06:54.164
- who made that call to the Pentagon.
- What?

06:54.998 --> 06:56.875
Why the hell is Emily

06:57.000 --> 06:59.336
talking to you about stuff like this?
Why didn't she come to me?

06:59.461 --> 07:01.296
This is the first opportunity
that we've had.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.216
And with regards to Aaron,

07:04.341 --> 07:05.968
there has to be some kind
of explanation.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.388
I mean, any number of people
could have asked him to make that call.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.391
Okay, but we have to consider
the possibility that it is him.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.560
Fine, then I'll talk to him,
confront him with the evidence,

07:14.685 --> 07:16.562
- and he can explain himself.
- You can't.

07:16.687 --> 07:20.941
Tom, you yourself said just the other day
we can't trust anyone.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.196
I watched Aaron fight tooth and nail
to protect and secure my presidency.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.489
I know. I know.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.826
If Aaron is involved
with the terrorist - if -

07:30.951 --> 07:34.246
and you confront him
and you show him your hand,

07:34.371 --> 07:36.665
you're putting yourself
at even more risk.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.085
It's not exactly like I can freeze
him out until I get to the bottom of this.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.044
I need his help.

07:41.170 --> 07:43.714
But there has to be a way
to keep him at arm's length

07:43.839 --> 07:45.799
without arousing suspicion.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.513
This is unbelievable.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.225
I mean, the resources involved
and the planning...

07:56.310 --> 07:58.979
a conspiracy that reaches
all the way to the vice president.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.568
I'm sorry I doubted you.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.364
It's not just the Bureau. The whole
country owes you a great debt.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.202
Thank you, sir.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.580
Unfortunately, this isn't enough.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.415
What? Why?

08:18.540 --> 08:22.085
It's one thing to know MacLeish is guilty.
It's another one to nail him for it.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.421
What more do we need?
I have the photos.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.089
- I have the--
- You're talking about accusing

08:26.215 --> 08:27.925
the vice president of the United States

08:28.050 --> 08:30.093
of being involved in one of
the greatest crimes in history.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.804
We need direct evidence
tying him to the conspiracy.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.974
We don't even have enough to detain him,
much less make him sweat.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.144
Then we find grounds.
We... We get someone

08:39.269 --> 08:41.145
to apply the heat,
and we flush him out.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.438
Who?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.775
The gunman was our best bet.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.443
He's dead.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.905
MacLeish has other partners.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.287
Right. I thought you said
you didn't have a lead on her.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.249
I don't. But Jason Atwood might.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.214
Jason.

09:07.714 --> 09:08.757
Hannah.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.968
Leave us now.
Thank you.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.680
I had them turned off.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.515
No eyes, no ears,
just you and me.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.977
It's good to see you.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.940
How... How are you?
What happened to you?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.192
It's nothing. I'm okay.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.485
How are you?

09:29.987 --> 09:31.947
How's my family? How's Luke?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.829
- Nobody told you?
- Tell me what?

09:38.954 --> 09:40.372
I've been in solitary.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.165
What happened?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.210
Jason, Luke is still missing.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.670
What?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.339
Oh.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.342
No, that wasn't the deal.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.511
- Jason, listen to me.
- No.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.347
I told the president everything
about MacLeish,

09:57.472 --> 09:58.974
Catalan, the blueprints.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.727
There is nothing left
for you to protect.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.854
Tell me what you know about her.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.188
Jason?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.566
Where did you get that?

10:07.691 --> 10:09.735
I took it.
You gave me the lead, remember?

10:09.860 --> 10:12.321
The Weddle case.
I knew they had Luke.

10:12.446 --> 10:16.033
I also knew this is how they got you
to confess to Nassar's murder.

10:16.158 --> 10:20.245
Jason, take your statement back.
Tell me everything you know.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.247
Listen to me, if they know

10:22.372 --> 10:24.666
- that I'm cooperating with you--
- They won't.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.544
They had Nassar in a federal
maximum-security prison

10:27.669 --> 10:28.670
and still got to him.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.340
They're exposed now.
We know about MacLeish.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.383
- Jason...
- Hannah...

10:35.344 --> 10:37.804
Please. We need your help.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.016
You want to help me...

10:41.808 --> 10:43.560
...find my son.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.113
All I know is what the White House
switchboard operator told me.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.115
That Aaron made the call
to the Secretary of Defense

10:57.240 --> 10:58.784
right before
the threat-assessment memo

10:58.909 --> 11:02.287
- was recalled by the Pentagon.
- And he confronted you?

11:02.412 --> 11:04.790
Yes. He found out
I was making inquiries.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.125
He was very upset.
He asked what I was doing.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.960
I told him he needed to talk to you.

11:09.086 --> 11:12.130
Okay, I'm sorry
I put you in this position,

11:12.255 --> 11:14.132
but I'll handle it from here.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.967
Are you sure you don't want me
to follow up?

11:16.093 --> 11:17.636
No, I've got it. Thank you.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.598
Emily.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.395
I need you to keep this conversation
between us. Understood?

11:27.437 --> 11:29.564
- Of course.
- Thank you.

11:35.237 --> 11:38.907
Sir, you don't really think
he's a traitor, do you?

11:40.617 --> 11:41.868
No.

11:42.619 --> 11:43.954
No, I don't.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.209
But until I can prove that definitively,
I have to keep my guard up, and so do you.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.297
We're living in a different world today
than we were yesterday.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.099
- Yeah?
<i>- Speaker Hookstraten is here, sir.</i>

12:04.474 --> 12:05.726
All right, send her in.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.979
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

12:09.104 --> 12:09.980
Of course, Madam Speaker.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.107
As I said before, I can
only give you a few minutes.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.359
This will take 30 seconds.
I need to see the president.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.444
Ma'am--

12:15.569 --> 12:17.529
I wouldn't be asking
if it wasn't important.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.532
I understand, but the president's
still in recovery right now.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.534
Clearly, he's still
conducting business.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.535
Yes, but--

12:23.660 --> 12:26.413
So... I need to see him.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.708
Why don't you tell me what
it's regarding? And I'll relay it to him.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.711
What this is regarding is strictly
between me and the president.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.296
All right.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.299
Respectfully, Madam Speaker,
I'm his Chief of Staff.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.884
It's my job to know
what's going on.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.887
Perhaps, but not from me.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.430
He'll know what this is about.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.851
He can tell you if he wants,
but I'm not gonna betray his confidence.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.312
I'll try and schedule you in.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.022
Thank you.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.359
Try hard.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.989
Absolutely not.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.407
I can help find Luke Atwood.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.367
- Let me liaise with state police --
- Don't make this personal.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.203
It is personal.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.079
I promised Jason I would do
everything I can.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.208
Yes, and the boy has been a state-wide
priority since he was taken.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.418
You just saw me put
three more agents on it myself.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.296
Now, each one of them is more qualified
in missing persons than you.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.593
Your job right now is to come up
with a plan for the president.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.553
You can't afford to have feelings.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.057
I'm right. And you know it.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.892
Now let's get back to work.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.394
Mr. President, let me say again

13:31.520 --> 13:34.272
how relieved Beth and I are
to know you're okay.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.607
That means a great deal.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.192
You catch my remarks
this morning?

13:37.317 --> 13:40.570
Yes, I did, and I appreciated them.
Thank you.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.906
In regards to last night,
you may have heard

13:43.031 --> 13:44.574
that there was some
internal disagreement.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.452
I gave the shoot-to-kill order

13:47.577 --> 13:49.704
'cause I didn't want to see more
innocent people get hurt.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.249
All the intel suggested
this guy was a pro,

13:52.374 --> 13:53.500
he wasn't gonna be taken alive.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.795
I understand.
I might have handled it differently.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.296
But if there's one thing
I've learned

13:58.421 --> 14:00.799
since becoming president,
it's how difficult it is

14:00.924 --> 14:04.427
to make life-and-death decisions
under extreme pressure.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.930
Thank you, sir.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.933
You know,
I only held the job for a day,

14:10.058 --> 14:11.935
but it did make me appreciate

14:12.060 --> 14:13.603
everything you've done for this country.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.445
And then what did he say?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.114
He thanked me.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.449
Then he told me
he wants me to take over

14:26.575 --> 14:28.285
his public schedule
for the rest of the month,

14:28.410 --> 14:30.954
- till he's back at full strength.
- Ah, that's excellent.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.956
- That's what you'll do.
- Yeah.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.209
And for the moment, we lay low
until further instruction.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.091
What kind of instructions?

14:43.216 --> 14:44.259
Another attempt?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.802
I doubt it.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.513
I think we consolidate our gains
in the short term.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.141
Beth, there are so many loose ends.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.477
And the loose ends
are being attended to, Peter.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.481
Catalan is dead.
Agent Wells is in custody.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.317
She'll be taken care of.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.320
We'll get through this.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.821
We always do.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.286
I've never felt anger
like this before.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.999
You know, I've never even hit
someone in my entire life,

15:16.833 --> 15:18.627
not even in grade school.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.837
I was always the peacemaker.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.675
But when I saw him
just standing there, smiling,

15:26.301 --> 15:28.678
I wanted to reach out
and strangle him.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.682
Honestly, I think
I could have killed him.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.685
You hid it well, sir.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.563
He thinks he's playing you,
but in reality,

15:38.688 --> 15:42.317
he's a prisoner in plain sight,
in full view of the American public,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.903
not to mention a phalanx
of Secret Service agents.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.905
We just got to be patient.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.366
He'll make a mistake,
lower his guard.

15:50.659 --> 15:51.826
And when he does...

15:51.952 --> 15:53.703
He's mine.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.001
How are you feeling, Mr. President?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.711
Much better. Thank you.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.880
All right.
Where would you like to start?

16:04.005 --> 16:05.548
Let me begin.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.801
I understand there's some
tension between you and Emily.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.097
She's been looking
into my phone records.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.099
At my direction.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.726
I also asked her
to keep you out of the loop.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.228
May I ask why?

16:18.353 --> 16:22.023
Of course. You... You deserve
an explanation. You're my Chief of Staff.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.025
The truth is, at the request
of the Secret Service,

16:24.150 --> 16:26.111
I have had to re-vet
my entire inner circle.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.445
Because of the bombing.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.406
A thousand people
died that night, and...

16:29.531 --> 16:31.741
and it left more questions
than answers.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.744
- I hope you understand.
- Yeah. Of course, sir.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.080
I asked Emily to coordinate
your background check.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.082
So naturally,
she couldn't divulge

16:39.207 --> 16:40.750
what she was doing
because it was classified.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.253
Understood.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.089
And I apologize for any confusion,

16:46.214 --> 16:48.466
but it was my call, not Emily's.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.260
Mr. President,
there's no need for apologies.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.928
It all makes perfect sense now.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.223
Okay. Great.
What have you got?

16:55.348 --> 16:59.060
Um... Speaker Hookstraten
came to see me,

16:59.185 --> 17:01.104
and she said she needed
to talk to you,

17:01.229 --> 17:02.939
that you would know
what it's about.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.317
Something's here.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.778
We shake this tree hard enough,
it'll fall out.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.946
How can you be so sure?

17:12.115 --> 17:14.159
The eight surviving members
of MacLeish's army unit

17:14.284 --> 17:16.161
have all been lying for a decade.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.496
There's got to be a weak link
in here somewhere,

17:18.621 --> 17:21.415
someone with personal problems,
drugs, booze, something.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.126
So what are you thinking?

17:23.251 --> 17:26.128
We find that person
and break him, but carefully.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.797
We can't afford
to tip MacLeish off.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.801
We need to rattle his cage,
not shatter it.

17:31.926 --> 17:32.969
Right.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.153
No! Help!

18:20.350 --> 18:21.518
No!

18:23.812 --> 18:25.021
Hey.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.524
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.359
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:29.484 --> 18:33.571
- Are you okay, Daddy?
- Yeah.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.532
I just, uh...

18:35.657 --> 18:36.991
I had a bad dream.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.577
What do you got there?

18:39.702 --> 18:41.496
I drew it for you.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.289
For me?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.292
Wow.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.587
It's beautiful.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.756
Did you steal it
from a museum?

18:51.881 --> 18:53.883
No. I drew it.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.427
Daddy screamed.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.346
He did not.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.794
Hi. Uh, how...

19:29.919 --> 19:31.421
how long have you
been standing there?

19:31.546 --> 19:33.423
Long enough to hear
how good you are.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.633
I didn't even know you played.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.721
I was serious about it for a while,
but now I just play to release stress.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.681
And does it work?

19:42.765 --> 19:44.225
Sometimes.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.315
So, I just got back
from the hospital.

19:50.440 --> 19:54.611
Listen, I-I get why
you're being so cagey.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.613
It was a matter
of national security.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.281
Aaron, he asked me to vet you.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.408
It was strictly classified,
so when you confronted me,

20:00.533 --> 20:04.829
- I couldn't tell you what was going on.
- I know. No, he told me.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.581
I'm...

20:07.957 --> 20:10.919
I'm sorry.
I-I was a bit of a jerk.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.380
I get it. It was stressful
for both of us.

20:14.881 --> 20:15.924
Yeah.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.554
So, you, uh--
you take any requests?

20:23.473 --> 20:25.183
I should get back.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.392
Yeah.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.811
Yeah, me too.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.439
See you around.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.816
Yeah.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.506
XL1200C Sportster.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.049
That's a nice ride.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.468
I can get you a good price
on her once I'm through.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.054
I think it's a little bit
too much bike for me.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.808
- Alvin Joyner?
- Yeah.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.601
Special Agent Johnson, FBI.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.188
I already talked to the FBI, weeks ago,

21:12.313 --> 21:13.398
about Captain MacLeish.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.150
Oh, it's just a routine follow-up
on our background check, Alvin.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.735
The Bureau doesn't like
to get anything wrong,

21:17.860 --> 21:20.738
especially when it involves
the vice president of the United States.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.366
But I need to cross
a few T's and dot a few I's

21:23.491 --> 21:26.035
before we can officially close the file.
Is that okay?

21:26.494 --> 21:27.870
Yeah, sure. Shoot.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.039
About this mission to Kunar Province,

21:30.164 --> 21:33.209
November 14, 2005,
your after-action report

21:33.334 --> 21:36.546
says you set out with 20 men.
Is that correct?

21:36.671 --> 21:39.549
Yeah. Three squads.
But we weren't full strength.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.385
Uh, Morrow had a bad knee,
and Rodriguez...

21:42.510 --> 21:44.554
...was on family leave.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.390
Okay, uh, so, why does
the outbound-helicopter manifest

21:47.515 --> 21:49.684
say 21 troops?

21:50.476 --> 21:51.728
I don't know.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.732
Maybe somebody made a mistake.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.400
You know, I thought that, so I asked

21:57.525 --> 22:00.111
the warrant officer involved,
and he said absolutely not.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.405
He said they can't afford
to make mistakes like that.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.240
Lives depend on it.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.451
I don't know what to tell you.

22:06.576 --> 22:09.412
Is it possible someone else
joined your mission that night, Alvin?

22:10.246 --> 22:13.624
- No. No. No way.
- You sure?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.418
Because the warrant officer
said that sometimes

22:15.543 --> 22:17.920
outside personnel
will be assigned to missions.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.423
Intelligence officers, CIA,
stuff like that.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.258
Nope. Never happened.

22:23.718 --> 22:24.927
All right.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.638
Well, I guess we're done here then.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.099
- Good luck.
- Thanks for your time.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.574
Tell the president it's game on.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.912
He's gonna run to MacLeish.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.421
Mr. President, I appreciate
that you have a job to do,

23:00.546 --> 23:02.632
but I wouldn't be doing mine
if I didn't advise you

23:02.757 --> 23:04.842
against leaving the hospital
so soon after surgery.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.969
Captain, I understand completely.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.014
But I really do have to get back.
It's a matter of national security.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.850
And you were the one who said you were
really happy with my progress.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.478
True, but I also cautioned
against undue stress.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.481
Well, I'm afraid I've got
the wrong job for that.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.316
See? You're not gonna win with him.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.443
- So I'm discovering.
- Look, I promise you,

23:22.568 --> 23:24.487
I will do everything I can
to take it easy.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.697
Besides, last time I checked,
I think I outrank you.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.873
Alex, I know you're mad at me,
but I really do need to get back.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.208
You're gonna have to trust me.

23:37.333 --> 23:42.171
Tom, I saw the way you looked
watching that press conference.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.840
What is going on?

23:45.007 --> 23:47.468
- Is it MacLeish?
- I can't tell you.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.054
- I can handle it.
- Alex, you're not hearing me.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.140
I <i>can't</i> tell you.

23:54.142 --> 23:57.395
You mean the president can't tell me.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.021
Right now, we're one and the same.

24:04.444 --> 24:07.155
Yeah, we're just coming back
from Norfolk now.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.531
Oh, it was fine.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.701
Shook a lot of hands, broke a champagne
bottle on a destroyer's bow.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.828
It was strictly routine.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.707
Yeah, I love you, too.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.620
<i>Hey.</i>

24:55.745 --> 24:57.705
I saw your chalk mark.
What's up?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.707
<i>It's Joyner.
He wants to see you.</i>

24:59.832 --> 25:01.209
Why?

25:01.334 --> 25:03.878
<i>The FBI came to see him again today.</i>

25:04.003 --> 25:06.255
Again? What about?

25:06.672 --> 25:09.050
<i>Said it was a routine follow-up,
something to do</i>

25:09.175 --> 25:11.677
<i>with a helicopter manifest
on the Kunar mission.</i>

25:12.345 --> 25:14.388
Helicopter manifest?

25:14.514 --> 25:17.225
<i>Yeah. It sounds like
bureaucratic busywork to me.</i>

25:17.350 --> 25:19.060
Well, it sounds like
the end of it then.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.811
<i>Yeah, except for Joyner.
You know Alvin, Cap.</i>

25:20.937 --> 25:23.981
<i>He took it harder than the rest of us.
He's been in and out of rehab.</i>

25:24.106 --> 25:25.775
<i>Wouldn't take much
to push him over the edge.</i>

25:25.900 --> 25:27.401
<i>I hate to put you
in this position,</i>

25:27.527 --> 25:29.654
<i>but he wouldn't listen to me,
insisted that he had to--</i>

25:29.779 --> 25:32.114
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Of course I'll see him.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.741
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

25:34.242 --> 25:35.451
It's okay.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.912
Improvise, adapt, overcome, right?

25:38.579 --> 25:40.623
Tell him I'll, uh...
Yeah.

25:40.748 --> 25:45.294
I'll meet him at the, uh, same place
as last time, tonight, 21:00.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.629
<i>Roger that.</i>

25:46.754 --> 25:48.297
Okay.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.679
I told the president
you wanted to see him.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.180
And?

25:56.305 --> 25:58.349
And he said he'd get back to you
when he can.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.017
Not good enough.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.352
The president just changed
his plans, ma'am.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.812
He's getting out
of the hospital tonight.

26:02.937 --> 26:04.814
- Tonight? Why?
- Because he wants to get back to work.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.857
Now, listen, if what
you want to share with him

26:06.983 --> 26:09.151
- is time-sensitive, just tell me.
- It's about the gunman.

26:10.736 --> 26:11.862
What about the gunman?

26:11.988 --> 26:15.533
I want to know why the FBI blew away
our own Lee Harvey Oswald.

26:15.658 --> 26:18.619
The suspect posed an immediate
threat to law enforcement.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.706
Oh, come on.
It was a cluster of epic proportions.

26:21.831 --> 26:24.375
Was the shooter a lone wolf,
part of a group?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.043
We'll never know now.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.838
But there was Vice President MacLeish
this morning

26:28.963 --> 26:30.715
turning it into a victory lap.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.009
- Why?
- You weren't in the room, ma'am.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.928
But you were, Aaron.
What happened?

26:36.679 --> 26:39.682
Was MacLeish involved,
yes or no?

26:43.185 --> 26:45.354
Even the President has
his suspicions about MacLeish.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.190
He told me so himself.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.568
Or didn't he fill you in?

26:50.693 --> 26:53.237
What are you talking about?
Of course he told me.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.532
Well, then you know that he asked me
to keep an eye on MacLeish.

26:56.657 --> 26:59.160
- I need to be in the loop, Aaron.
- I'm sorry. I can't--

26:59.285 --> 27:01.579
If the White House
doesn't cooperate,

27:01.704 --> 27:04.373
I'll just call a congressional hearing...

27:05.166 --> 27:06.709
or maybe a press conference.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.085
You can't go public with this.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.296
What are you trying to protect?

27:11.380 --> 27:14.842
Or should I say <i>who</i>
are you trying to protect?

27:14.967 --> 27:18.679
After all, it was you
who pushed MacLeish for V.P.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.265
- more than anyone else.
- Now, that's low.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.558
But accurate.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.019
What happened last night?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.233
Fine.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.570
I'll see you in committee.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.406
We had the shooter contained.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.244
FBI was ready to apprehend,

27:42.828 --> 27:44.246
but MacLeish overruled them.

27:45.039 --> 27:45.873
Why?

27:45.998 --> 27:49.919
He said he wanted to protect
the lives of the men on the ground.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.382
I told him the president
would want to take him alive,

27:54.507 --> 27:57.093
but he... he gave the order anyway.

27:57.927 --> 27:58.886
What order?

28:00.096 --> 28:01.430
Shoot to kill.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.268
And that's for your ears only, all right?

28:06.686 --> 28:09.480
Of course.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.317
<i>We start by limiting
his access</i>

28:13.442 --> 28:16.320
to national-security documents
and intelligence briefings.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.490
We do it under the guise
of a staff-wide security review.

28:19.615 --> 28:20.825
Aaron won't know
he's being targeted.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.827
Okay, good.
I want to keep it that way.

28:22.952 --> 28:25.663
I also recommend we renew
his TS/SCI clearance.

28:25.788 --> 28:29.500
That'll give us access to his finances,
recent travel, personal contacts.

28:29.625 --> 28:33.254
Okay, just remember,
we want to clear him, not bury him.

28:33.879 --> 28:34.922
Affirmative, sir.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.507
Where does that put us
with MacLeish?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.217
Trap has been set.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.345
Agent Wells is sitting on one of
MacLeish's old Army buddies,

28:41.470 --> 28:42.930
just waiting for him to make a move.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.015
In the meantime, I've filled in
his security detail,

28:45.141 --> 28:48.352
told them to give the vice president
a wide berth, should he request it.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.771
I guess the only thing
left to do is wait.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.606
It's always the hardest part, sir.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.899
Yeah.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.986
You can't be serious.

28:57.111 --> 28:59.488
I told you every move we make now
has to be cautious.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.199
Exposing yourself like this,
it's too risky.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.160
We've been down this road
with Joyner before.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.495
- It's not--
- It's not worth it, Peter.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.789
You're a heartbeat away
from the presidency.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.916
Let someone else fix the problem.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.335
I'm the only one he'll talk to.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.671
That's not what I mean.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.137
No.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.515
If he's in as much pain as you say,
we'll be doing him a favor.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.477
- No.
- You're not in the army anymore, Peter.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.645
We pledged ourselves
to a higher cause.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.315
Beth, he's one of my men.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.691
We've been through hell together.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.861
And now he becomes
another casualty of war.

29:39.695 --> 29:43.073
A casualty of war?
Are you hearing yourself?

29:43.199 --> 29:44.533
Are you?

29:44.658 --> 29:47.828
- The FBI came to see him.
- On a routine follow-up.

29:47.953 --> 29:51.624
The guy just needs some reassurance.
I can give it to him.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.006
Fine.

29:59.673 --> 30:02.051
Talk to him this once.

30:02.802 --> 30:06.555
But if it doesn't work,
the problem has to be eliminated.

30:07.640 --> 30:11.143
No victory without sacrifice, remember?

30:13.813 --> 30:15.564
I remember.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.284
Atwood.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.912
I got nothing to say to you.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.915
Jason, it's about Luke.

30:49.765 --> 30:50.975
Jason.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.059
Wait.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.895
Sir. Sir!

30:55.020 --> 30:56.063
No! Let him go!

30:56.188 --> 30:57.731
Let him...

31:14.790 --> 31:16.458
Yeah?

31:17.459 --> 31:18.794
Car's ready, Mr. Vice President.

31:18.919 --> 31:20.796
Thanks, Rich.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.966
- It's just the two of you, right?
- As you requested, sir.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.801
I'll be right down.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.186
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.856
- You okay?
- You got anything to drink?

31:38.981 --> 31:40.733
That good, huh?

31:52.494 --> 31:53.829
Go ahead.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.877
I mean, that-- Okay.

32:00.002 --> 32:03.213
That's an 18-year Macallan,
but, yeah, help yourself.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.840
Thank you.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.967
Is this about Aaron?

32:07.927 --> 32:11.221
Okay. I'll take "political malaise"
for $20.

32:11.347 --> 32:13.891
- Oh, you suck.
- Thank you.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.226
I thought I knew
how this town worked,

32:16.352 --> 32:18.896
but it doesn't
make sense anymore.

32:19.021 --> 32:22.566
You know, every-- everyone
I thought I could count on,

32:22.691 --> 32:24.652
everything,
it doesn't matter.

32:24.777 --> 32:27.488
The system wins
in the end, right?

32:28.322 --> 32:29.573
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.743
Maybe I'm naive. Maybe I'm both.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.036
Who knows?

32:34.536 --> 32:37.581
Did I ever tell you about how I got
my first job at the White House?

32:37.706 --> 32:38.874
Harvard Lampoon connection.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.376
I told you?

32:40.501 --> 32:42.753
Seth, nobody can have
a personal conversation with you

32:42.878 --> 32:45.172
without Harvard coming up,
usually within the first 30 seconds.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.341
Not true. I always say
I went to school in Cambridge.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.051
Anyway, I'm ignoring that.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.845
My point is that
when I first started here,

32:51.971 --> 32:53.555
I mean, I was floored, all right?

32:53.681 --> 32:56.058
I couldn't walk more
than 50 feet without stopping.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.227
Here I was at the White House, right?

32:58.352 --> 33:00.688
The son of immigrants.
I mean, I couldn't believe--

33:00.813 --> 33:03.107
Wait. Hold on. I thought your dad's
a successful engineer.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.526
Don't interrupt. What I'm saying was
I couldn't believe that I was here.

33:06.360 --> 33:11.156
And then work took over,
and reality reared its ugly head.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.910
And I started to realize
why Washington is the way it is.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.874
And then I bump into
Tom Kirkman in the bathroom

33:21.000 --> 33:22.543
after the entire government's
been blown up,

33:22.668 --> 33:25.546
and he's nothing
but decency and compassion.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.966
I mean, this guy is
service over ambition,

33:29.091 --> 33:31.593
integrity above expedience.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.096
And it reminded me what it felt like

33:34.221 --> 33:36.390
to be part of something
bigger than yourself...

33:39.727 --> 33:43.230
...what it felt like to
be part of the kind of America

33:43.355 --> 33:45.691
that you want to believe in.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.028
I still feel that way tonight.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.822
So how come I don't?

33:51.947 --> 33:53.574
'Cause you're a perfectionist.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.827
And suddenly
things don't seem so perfect.

33:56.952 --> 34:00.330
No. I'm not a child, Seth.
I know things aren't perfect.

34:00.456 --> 34:02.916
Yes, but you think
you can make things perfect.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.752
Well...

34:04.877 --> 34:07.921
It's not that I--
Maybe.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.297
Maybe.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.550
Emily, come on.
You're doing a great job.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.927
Even perfectionists
have their ups and downs.

34:14.053 --> 34:17.931
Not to oversimplify it,
but I think you're probably sad.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.643
We're all really sad.
There's nothing wrong with that.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.146
You need to go home,
get home safely,

34:24.271 --> 34:26.482
get a really good night's sleep.

34:26.607 --> 34:30.652
That is all of my advice at this hour.
You get more tomorrow.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.616
- Thank you.
- No, no, no.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.451
Shut up. Good night.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.659
Good night.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.682
Yes, ma'am, can I help you?

35:00.808 --> 35:01.934
I hope so.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.520
My name is Angela Lindsay.

35:04.645 --> 35:07.523
I'm an attorney with Payton,
Stein, and Gossett.

35:07.648 --> 35:11.026
You have an FBI agent
in custody, Hannah Wells.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.737
We've been retained
by her family.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.490
I need to see her
immediately, please.

35:36.552 --> 35:37.761
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- It's Beth.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.346
<i>You shouldn't be calling me.</i>

35:39.471 --> 35:41.181
The FBI agent who questioned Joyner,
who was it?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.934
<i>- I don't know. Joyner didn't say.</i>
- Well, was it a man or a woman?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.894
<i>A woman, Asian woman,
I think he said. Why?</i>

35:50.482 --> 35:52.818
Come on, Peter. Pick up.

35:55.362 --> 35:58.323
- <i>The subscriber you are trying--</i>
- Damn it.

36:41.867 --> 36:45.454
Alvin, these are Agents Damashek
and Palmer.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.956
Hold your arms out, please, sir.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.384
Thanks, gentlemen.
Be with you in a few minutes.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.393
Let's take a walk.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.117
I'm-- I'm sorry, Cap.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.662
No, no, no, don't be sorry.

37:26.787 --> 37:27.704
What's going on?

37:27.829 --> 37:29.206
I get nervous, you know?

37:29.331 --> 37:30.958
Someone's gonna find out.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.793
<i>The FBI--
they got this manifest.</i>

37:32.918 --> 37:34.795
<i>It's paperwork, red tape.</i>

37:34.920 --> 37:37.798
<i>- You know the army.
- I know, Cap, but the truth --</i>

37:37.923 --> 37:41.802
<i>The truth got buried
a long time ago, Alvin.</i>

37:41.927 --> 37:44.763
Not for me, not in here.

37:45.639 --> 37:48.308
I still see all their faces, what we did.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.018
You got to pull yourself together, man.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.228
I wish I'd died there, Captain.

37:51.353 --> 37:52.521
- Oh, come on.
- I swear.

37:52.646 --> 37:53.981
<i>I wish I never came back.</i>

37:54.106 --> 37:57.651
<i>What happened that day
was not your fault.</i>

37:57.776 --> 38:00.320
<i>We were betrayed, remember?</i>

38:00.445 --> 38:01.989
<i>We had to defend ourselves.</i>

38:02.114 --> 38:05.534
<i>We did what we had to do
to save each other.</i>

38:06.660 --> 38:08.912
This new office I'm in, I mean,

38:09.037 --> 38:11.248
I can't be making visits
like this anymore,

38:11.373 --> 38:13.292
so I need to know...

38:14.459 --> 38:16.086
...can I count on you?

38:16.211 --> 38:19.423
- John 8:32.
- Oh.

38:19.548 --> 38:21.341
<i>Alvin, no. Alvin.</i>

38:21.466 --> 38:23.593
<i>- "And you will know the truth."
- This is important.</i>

38:23.719 --> 38:26.013
<i>- "And the truth will set you free."
- You don't know how important.</i>

38:26.138 --> 38:27.514
<i>That's the Bible.
It's not the government.</i>

38:27.639 --> 38:29.016
<i>The government's
not interested in truth.</i>

38:29.141 --> 38:32.102
<i>It's the government that lies.
They sent us</i>

38:32.227 --> 38:33.353
into a slaughterhouse,

38:33.478 --> 38:35.022
and then they covered it up.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.232
They used us, so we used them.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.527
Yes, you lied. We all did, Alvin.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.113
I lied to Congress to protect
the unit, to protect you.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.906
You got to live up to your end...

38:45.032 --> 38:46.867
- That's it. Go.
<i>- ...of the bargain and protect us.</i>

38:46.992 --> 38:49.411
'Cause if you fail to do that,
you're not only gonna destroy us --

38:49.536 --> 38:52.247
FBI! Freeze! Don't move!

38:52.372 --> 38:55.208
Vice President MacLeish,
I'm arresting you for perjury

38:55.334 --> 38:57.461
in front of
the United States Congress.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.921
Put your hands on your head.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.050
- Now.
- Run, Cap!

39:09.723 --> 39:12.017
Let's go.
Target is 200 yards out.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.903
The next one counts.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.490
You're not gonna shoot me.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.116
Put your hands on your head.

39:28.241 --> 39:29.910
You got nothing, Wells.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.286
On your knees.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.083
On your knees.

39:36.208 --> 39:40.003
I'm the vice president
of the United States.

39:40.128 --> 39:42.047
You're just a cop.

39:47.094 --> 39:48.637
No!

40:11.159 --> 40:12.869
Thank you.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.037
Don't work too hard.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.373
Thank you.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.959
Take care.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.232
I have to meet you at the car.
