I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MY ACTIONS.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.620
NO, <i>I'LLBE FIRED.</i>

08:56.720 --> 08:59.640
FOR ONCE, I'LL HAVE A SPINE
AND CHANGE MY LIFE.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.740
( TICKING )

09:05.840 --> 09:10.380
WHERE ARE THEY?!

09:10.480 --> 09:13.460
Benson: "DEAR MR. MAELLARD,
WE ACCEPT THAT WE MESSED UP.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.140
BUT YOU'RE CRAZY
TO MAKE ONE OF US

09:15.240 --> 09:16.740
WRITE A RESIGNATION LETTER.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.620
YOU SEE US
AS YOU WANT TO SEE US.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.860
IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.980
YOU SEE US AS AN ANGRY,
UPTIGHT BOSS..."

09:22.080 --> 09:23.380
â"AN IRRESPONSIBLE SLACKER."

09:23.480 --> 09:24.980
"A GUY WHO HAS NO FUN."

09:25.080 --> 09:27.340
â"A GUY WHO HAS TOO MUCH FUN."

09:27.440 --> 09:28.540
( HONKâHONK )

09:28.640 --> 09:30.500
"A GUY WHO'S ESTRANGED
FROM HIS FATHER."

09:30.600 --> 09:33.020
DAD, WE NEVER TALK.

09:33.120 --> 09:35.620
"SO, IF ONE OF US RESIGNS
FROM YOUR PRECIOUS PARK,

09:35.720 --> 09:37.220
WE BOTH RESIGN.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.420
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

09:39.520 --> 09:42.740
SINCERELY, THE LUNCH CLUB.

09:42.840 --> 09:47.020
P.S. SHOVE IT,
YOU DECREPIT OLD FART."

09:47.120 --> 09:49.540
AH, IT'S NO USE.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.900
I CAN'T READ THIS
AT ALL.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.660
POPS!
READ THIS FOR ME.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.540
I CAN'T FIND
MY GLASSES.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.660
UM, IT SAYS,

09:58.760 --> 10:01.260
"WE LOVE THE PARK AND
DON'T WANT TO BE FIRED.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.700
WE'RE SORRY.
LOVE, BENSON AND RIGBY.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.020
P.S." AHâHUVVV!

10:07.120 --> 10:08.580
NICE THINGS!

10:08.680 --> 10:10.660
( LAUGHS NERVOUSLY )

10:10.760 --> 10:13.060
WELL,
WHAT A LOVELY LETTER!

10:13.160 --> 10:16.260
ESPECIALLY THE NICE THINGS
THEY SAID AT THE END.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.540
I FORGIVE THEM.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.300
THOSE TWO ROUND OUT
THE WHOLE DYNAMIC HERE.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.540
WHERE WOULD WE BE WITHOUT
A BENSON OR A RIGBY?

10:24.640 --> 10:27.300
HEH HEH. WHERE, INDEED?
HEH HEH.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.340
HA!
