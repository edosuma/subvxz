FEMALE OFFICER: Turn.

00:04.545 --> 00:06.127
(BAD TO THE BONE PLAYING)

00:08.259 --> 00:10.221
Geez, look at me.

00:10.221 --> 00:12.343
And I thought
my yearbook photo sucked.

00:13.184 --> 00:14.515
ABIGAIL: And that's me.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.478
Man, that dress does not
look good on anybody.

00:18.439 --> 00:19.230
FEMALE OFFICER: Turn.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.692
"Turn"? What if
I don't wanna turn?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.105
Who's gonna
turn me, you?

00:24.105 --> 00:25.776
Why don't you turn this?

00:25.776 --> 00:27.027
Something you should
know about me,

00:27.948 --> 00:29.410
I have a little problem
with authority.

00:29.410 --> 00:30.821
FEMALE OFFICER: Turn.

00:30.821 --> 00:33.414
In second grade,
I told our music teacher,
Mrs. Florentine,

00:33.414 --> 00:35.496
that if she wanted us
to sing like birds,

00:35.496 --> 00:38.209
she should get herself
some freakin' birds.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.121
I laughed so hard I peed.

00:40.121 --> 00:42.213
And then we had to
sit facing the corner
during recess.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.217
BOTH: We've been friends
ever since.

00:47.218 --> 00:49.090
PARKER: And that's Rachel.
FEMALE OFFICER: Turn.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.721
PARKER: Sweet Rachel.

00:52.133 --> 00:53.554
The only nice one
of the bunch of us.

00:54.175 --> 00:56.137
I feel so bad we
dragged her into this.

00:56.137 --> 00:58.559
But the thing is,
we did it all for her,
really we did.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.681
That was the idea, anyway.

01:01.182 --> 01:02.483
You know what,
maybe I better explain.

01:03.144 --> 01:04.144
We're bridesmaids.

01:05.396 --> 01:07.488
Not the good kind
who love the bride
like a sister

01:07.488 --> 01:11.242
and want to make her wedding
the most special day ever. No.

01:11.242 --> 01:12.653
PARKER: We're more like
the "Avenging angels

01:12.653 --> 01:16.157
"who are gonna give you
what's coming to you"
type of bridesmaid.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.750
You know what,
you're coming in
in the middle of things.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.753
So maybe I should
back up a bit.
Say, 20 years.

01:23.294 --> 01:26.797
So you can meet
the fourth member of
our little sisterhood.

01:29.210 --> 01:31.592
ABIGAIL: This is
where she lived.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.843
Still lives.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.176
It's such
an amazing house,
it has its own name,

01:35.176 --> 01:36.557
Bellefontaine.

01:38.889 --> 01:41.222
Caitlyn McNabb lives here
with her mother

01:41.222 --> 01:42.603
and occasional
stepfather.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.645
(GASPS) Oh, and servants,
of course.

01:44.645 --> 01:46.897
You need servants
when your house has
its own zip code.

01:46.897 --> 01:48.779
And by the way,
"Bellefontaine" is French

01:48.779 --> 01:52.533
for "My house is so much
nicer than your house
will ever be."

01:53.614 --> 01:55.616
It's a good thing
Caitlyn was an only child.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.868
She didn't
do sharing very well.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.241
She was much better
at taking.

02:00.241 --> 02:01.742
But we didn't mind.

02:01.742 --> 02:05.796
We were just little girls
blinded by the magic
of Bellefontaine.

02:05.796 --> 02:07.628
Could you blame us?

02:07.628 --> 02:11.252
There were tea parties
on the lawn with
homemade biscuits.

02:12.303 --> 02:14.425
And a secret staircase.

02:14.425 --> 02:17.558
You got to it from inside
of this huge wardrobe.

02:18.219 --> 02:19.139
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

02:19.139 --> 02:21.602
And it led all the way
to the backyard.

02:21.602 --> 02:22.813
Coast's clear.
Come on.

02:22.813 --> 02:25.226
We felt so lucky
to be there.

02:25.226 --> 02:26.817
Oh, and when we didn't,
Caitlyn would remind us

02:26.817 --> 02:29.230
how lucky we were
to be there.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.482
YOUNG CAITLYN:
...eight, nine, ten.

02:31.482 --> 02:33.534
Ready or not,
here I come.

02:33.534 --> 02:35.736
So, then we play
our own little version
of hide-and-seek.

02:35.736 --> 02:36.827

(GIGGLING)

02:36.827 --> 02:39.870
Rachel! Abigail! Parker!

02:40.371 --> 02:43.834
And we called it
"I know a place where
Caitlyn can't find us."

02:43.834 --> 02:46.837
It was a pretty spot
and under a cherry tree.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.290
But then,
Rachel would feel guilty
and we'd all go back...

02:49.290 --> 02:52.963
CAITLYN: Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful
princess that lived...

02:52.963 --> 02:54.555
...and listen to Caitlyn

02:55.846 --> 02:58.509
talk about Caitlyn
and make up stories
about Caitlyn.

02:58.509 --> 03:02.303
Got married, and lived
happily ever after.

03:02.303 --> 03:05.436

her rules, her ego.

Wait.

03:18.579 --> 03:19.700
What's that?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.242

03:21.242 --> 03:22.533
No, you're all bridesmaids.

There has to
be a groom.

Of course it does.

like most normal
nine year olds

03:37.007 --> 03:38.969

Right now we're playing

03:51.402 --> 03:52.903
there has to
be a groom.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.409
Well, doesn't there?
OLIVIA: Well, yes.

03:58.409 --> 04:00.911
Technically, dear.
But it's not
very important.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.703
Here,
let's use this chair.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.246
Thank you, Abigail.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.420
There. Isn't he handsome?

04:09.420 --> 04:11.792
And from a wealthy family,
I understand.

our life with Caitlyn...

04:25.936 --> 04:26.847
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

04:26.847 --> 04:29.600
...pretty much
through high school.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.944
She called the shots
and we played the parts.

Why? It's a small town.
You take what you can get.

04:37.488 --> 04:40.951
And in Lambert, Louisiana,
we got Miss Caitlyn McNabb.

04:41.612 --> 04:43.574
After college,
my folks moved out west,

04:43.574 --> 04:45.616
and Parker and I
both headed for New York.

04:45.616 --> 04:46.907
I got a book published.

04:46.907 --> 04:50.581
(CHUCKLING) It sold okay,
you know, for a first novel.

04:50.581 --> 04:54.965
The second one is
coming along slowly,
very slowly.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.589
Meanwhile, Parker went
the acting route.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.721
She did a bunch
of plays off Broadway.

05:00.721 --> 05:04.635
Well, off, off, off Broadway.

05:05.686 --> 05:07.137
I mean, she was good.

05:07.728 --> 05:11.522
But we always
kept in touch with Rachel,
who never left Lambert.

05:11.522 --> 05:15.396
She was going out
with this guy Tony
she was crazy about.

05:15.396 --> 05:16.937
And that seemed
to be enough for her.

05:16.937 --> 05:18.489
I mean,
from what I knew.

05:18.489 --> 05:19.820
I don't get
back home much.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.782
Parker goes back a lot.

05:22.403 --> 05:24.575
She actually likes
her parents.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.867
And that's how we ended up
in Lambert last week.

05:26.867 --> 05:30.080
Her parents' 30th anniversary,
and she dragged me along.

05:31.412 --> 05:34.455
Parker's dad was taking
her mom on the cruise
she'd always wanted.

05:34.455 --> 05:37.838
But first, the mandatory party
where every living relative

05:37.838 --> 05:41.011
can ask us why
we aren't married
or famous yet.

05:41.011 --> 05:43.554
And Parker does plays
in New York all the time.

05:43.554 --> 05:45.015
Don't you, dear?

05:45.015 --> 05:48.429
Uh, well, I...
I audition all the time.

I don't get back much.

05:52.563 --> 05:54.064
Sometimes I get callbacks.

05:54.064 --> 05:57.438
Which is sort of
like a chance to
audition again.

05:57.438 --> 05:59.109
You know what,
she's constantly in plays,

05:59.530 --> 06:00.901

to hear.

coming out. (CHUCKLES)

by her publisher.

I'm going to go check
my voicemail.

understand you.

invite y'all,

she couldn't find
your addresses anywhere.

I'm sure if you called
Parker's parents...

What's that, Parker,
like 30 years
in the same house?

have told you.

named Ashley.

she spells it "ey."

get confused.

to the wedding.

be there, right?

you haven't talked to
her in a while.

go out with.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.642
Although we can't
officially acknowledge
that ever happened.

09:21.642 --> 09:23.063
So, this is me
not acknowledging.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.236
You're Henry Kent.
You used to have big ears
and a slutty sister.

09:27.107 --> 09:28.949
I grew into my ears.

09:28.949 --> 09:30.741
And I'll tell Carol
you said hi.

09:30.951 --> 09:32.192
Thank you.

09:32.192 --> 09:34.244
I don't remember you.
Really?

09:34.905 --> 09:37.577
We only had
Bio together twice and
I asked you to prom.

09:38.038 --> 09:39.620
What?
No, I'm just kidding.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.871
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
I was two years older

09:40.871 --> 09:44.084
and I spent most of
high school tripping
over my ears.

09:44.915 --> 09:46.256
So, you still live
in Lambert?

09:46.256 --> 09:48.048
Yeah, still live
in Lambert.

09:48.048 --> 09:50.090
I'm sorry, no,
I didn't mean it
like that.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.802
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, you did.
Let's go find Rach.

09:51.802 --> 09:52.883
Okay.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.134
See you around.
Bye.

09:54.765 --> 09:55.766
Cute!
I know.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.181
Now, you two
just have to stay
for the wedding.

10:01.181 --> 10:02.813
Oh, we would love to,

10:02.813 --> 10:04.895
but I have
this big audition.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.817
And I have to
re-curl my weave.

10:06.817 --> 10:08.819
(LAUGHS) You...
Listen to you.

10:09.069 --> 10:10.861
Y'all know
you want to come
to this wedding.

10:10.861 --> 10:13.113
And Mother and I
would just adore
to have you.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.284
Mother!

10:14.735 --> 10:16.616
Have a safe trip back.

10:16.947 --> 10:18.118
Well, we would.

10:18.739 --> 10:20.080
Please think about it.

10:20.290 --> 10:21.291
Okay.

10:23.704 --> 10:25.245
Just let's go
find Rachel.

10:26.046 --> 10:26.957
(RACHEL SOBBING)

10:26.957 --> 10:28.959
Rach!
Rachel!

10:30.010 --> 10:31.301
Rachel, honey,
are you in there?

10:31.301 --> 10:32.923
RACHEL: It's okay,
I'm doing fine.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.054
(RACHEL BLOWING NOSE)

10:34.054 --> 10:35.886
You have been
dating Tony
for like ever.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.307
You said
he was the one.
What happened?

10:37.307 --> 10:38.889
Yeah, why the hell
didn't you call us?

10:38.889 --> 10:41.061
'Cause you would've
been mad and
yelled at me.

10:41.061 --> 10:43.103
You're damn right!

10:43.103 --> 10:43.894
(SNIFFLING)

10:44.765 --> 10:46.186
She stole him from you,
didn't she?

10:46.186 --> 10:48.108
No, no.
Caitlyn's a good friend.

10:48.108 --> 10:50.150
After all, she asked me
to be her bridesmaid.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.982
And why did you
say yes?

10:51.982 --> 10:53.153
Because I was
brought up well.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.195
Oh, honey,
what are you gonna do?

10:55.195 --> 10:57.828
I'm going to put on
that ugly fuchsia dress

10:58.038 --> 10:59.489
and march in that
bridal procession

10:59.489 --> 11:03.994
and show the whole world
that I'm completely and
totally over Tony Penning.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.126
Oh, my God.

11:06.837 --> 11:08.168
That's an air-tight plan.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.169
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

11:11.962 --> 11:14.054
Holy smokes!

11:14.054 --> 11:14.925
ASHLEY: What's wrong?

11:14.925 --> 11:17.177
Um, you know what?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.179
Rachel just found out

11:19.179 --> 11:22.142
that she signed up
for a phone plan that
doesn't have texting.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.805
Three years, no refund.
(BOTH GASP)

11:25.015 --> 11:26.857
Oh, you should've
asked me.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.979
Yuh-huh. Ashley knows
all the phone plans.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.983
I do. But Ashlie knows
where to find the best
frozen yogurt anywhere.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.154
ABIGAIL: So, wait,
let me get this straight.

11:34.154 --> 11:35.946
One of you guys fills in
what the other doesn't know.

11:37.778 --> 11:38.909
BOTH: Mmm-hmm.

11:38.909 --> 11:40.280
That's pretty awesome.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.282
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

11:44.084 --> 11:45.455
ABIGAIL:
Can you believe Caitlyn?

11:46.086 --> 11:47.878
PARKER: Poor Rachel.
I know.

11:47.878 --> 11:48.999
I mean, it's crazy!

11:48.999 --> 11:49.960
Tell me about it.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.793
PENNY: Lou, I still need
the big suitcase.

11:52.793 --> 11:55.005
Well, that's why
I'm getting it.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.097
What could Tony
possibly see in Caitlyn?

11:57.097 --> 11:58.839
Boobs. He's a guy.

11:59.099 --> 12:01.051
It's a business
transaction.

12:01.051 --> 12:02.392
What?
A business transaction?

12:02.392 --> 12:03.894
I really shouldn't
say anything.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.475
Have some wine, Lou.

12:05.896 --> 12:08.228
Did you hear something
down at the bank?

12:09.059 --> 12:10.190
Daddy?

12:11.521 --> 12:17.067
Well, three months ago,
Olivia put Bellefontaine
up for sale.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.949
What?
They've owned it forever.

12:19.279 --> 12:20.861
Olivia ran through
a third husband's money,

12:20.861 --> 12:22.783
was having trouble
finding number four.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.915
Gold-diggin' is
a young person's game.

12:24.915 --> 12:26.746
And Tony's family?
Loaded.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.078
A day after
the engagement,

12:28.078 --> 12:30.080
Olivia took the place
off the market.

12:30.420 --> 12:31.421
PENNY: Lou!

12:31.962 --> 12:33.924
Sex for money?

12:33.924 --> 12:35.876
It's good to see
traditional marriage
is alive and well.

12:35.876 --> 12:38.088
(EXCLAIMS) Poor Rachel.
We should tell her.

12:38.088 --> 12:40.090
Tell her a she-witch
stole the love of her life?

12:40.090 --> 12:40.971
I think she knows
that, Parker.

12:40.971 --> 12:43.093
Okay, but it's wrong!
It's evil, okay?

12:43.093 --> 12:44.144
We can't just drop it
like...
(RINGING)

12:44.434 --> 12:46.937
Oh, it's my agent.
I've got to take it.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.438
Hello?
ALICE: Parker darling?

12:48.438 --> 12:50.480
Oh, hey, Alice.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.233
Oh! The audition.
I almost forgot about it.

12:53.233 --> 12:54.774
When do they want
to see me?

12:55.105 --> 12:57.487
Oh, okay. I see.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.321
(STAMMERING) Not...
Okay. Love you, too.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.614
Good news?

13:04.614 --> 13:06.116
Not even a reading.
Nothing.

13:06.366 --> 13:08.078
You know what,
the play was flawed.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.040
The female characters
were completely
underwritten.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.411
It really wasn't even
worth my time.

13:11.411 --> 13:12.963
You wanted it bad,
didn't you?
So much.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.915
Yeah, I know.
Here, babe,
take this,

13:14.915 --> 13:17.007
and I'll get
some more for me.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.011
WOMAN ON TV:
Well, how was I supposed
to know, silly?

13:21.011 --> 13:23.423
A girl's not a mind reader,
you know.
MAN: Darling...

13:23.633 --> 13:25.976
PARKER: How could
Rachel and Tony
have mucked this up?

13:25.976 --> 13:27.137
They were perfect
for each other.

13:27.137 --> 13:29.139
You never met him.
I'm highly intuitive.

13:29.139 --> 13:30.640
They were meant
for each other,

13:30.640 --> 13:33.063
and now Tony is
gonna marry Caitlyn.
(BRIDAL MARCH PLAYING ON TV)

13:33.063 --> 13:34.985
And Rachel's gonna have
her heart broken forever.

13:34.985 --> 13:36.066
(SWITCHES OFF TV)

13:36.066 --> 13:38.358
Three thousand years of
watching romantic comedies

13:38.358 --> 13:40.030
and it's just
one big stinking lie.

13:40.030 --> 13:41.611
I mean,
the couple stumbles
around for two hours

13:41.611 --> 13:43.864
and then miraculously,
five minutes before
the credits roll,

13:43.864 --> 13:45.325
they realize that
they're meant
to be together?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.536
(LAUGHS)

13:46.536 --> 13:49.159
That is not how
life works, my friend.

13:49.409 --> 13:51.041
Action movies
have it right.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.332
You hate
action movies.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.214
I hate them
because they're right.

13:54.214 --> 13:58.008
In action movies,
some psychopath takes
25 sweet people hostage

13:58.008 --> 13:58.838
and he's gonna
kill 'em all.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.921
And then
Bruce Willis...
Or Denzel.

14:00.921 --> 14:03.013
Also good.
He puts together
an elite SWAT team

14:03.013 --> 14:05.095
of Navy SEALs,
and they go behind
enemy lines

14:05.095 --> 14:06.636
and they do
what has to be done.

14:06.636 --> 14:08.098
They wipe out
the henchmen,

14:08.098 --> 14:10.060
the psychopath dies
a spectacular death,

14:10.060 --> 14:11.641
and the sweet people
go free.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.023
That's what you need
to make love work,

14:13.023 --> 14:15.315
a ruthless SWAT team
with guns.

14:16.686 --> 14:18.278
Gavin still
hasn't called yet?
No.

14:18.278 --> 14:20.030
He went to LA
for pilot season

14:20.030 --> 14:21.191
with his cute
scene partner...

14:21.191 --> 14:23.073
BOTH: ...that he swears
he's not sleeping with. Ha!

14:24.244 --> 14:25.405
You should not
date actors.

14:25.405 --> 14:26.486
Who else do I meet?

14:26.486 --> 14:28.078
Oh, you met that
really cute guy
Henry today.

14:28.078 --> 14:29.199
And he liked you.

14:29.199 --> 14:30.540
No. He did not like me.

14:31.661 --> 14:34.374
Okay, yeah,
he did like me.
But he is a trap.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.997
There's like 300 of them
in every hometown.

14:36.997 --> 14:39.339
Nice, regular guy,
unpretentious.

14:39.339 --> 14:40.630
You go out on
one date

14:40.630 --> 14:42.382
and all of a sudden
you wake up 10 years later

14:42.552 --> 14:45.385
with six kids, a fat ass,
and ugly pink sweatpants.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.217
You like him.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.639
You really, really
like him.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.471
(STAMMERS) I do not.

14:51.471 --> 14:52.722
What are you going to do
when he calls?

14:52.722 --> 14:55.065
He's not going to call
because nice guys
don't call me.

14:55.065 --> 14:57.227
Just selfish actors who
screw their scene partners.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.069
And what are we going
to do about Rachel?

14:59.069 --> 15:00.570
I say we go
full bore SWAT team

15:00.570 --> 15:02.072
and break up
Caitlyn and Tony.

15:02.072 --> 15:03.613
Okay, no more
wine for you.

15:04.484 --> 15:05.575
No, I'm serious, right?

15:05.575 --> 15:07.077
That's what Will Smith
or Matt Damon

15:07.077 --> 15:09.409
or any of those
hot action guys
would've done.

15:09.619 --> 15:13.203
We sneak into the compound,
we bust stuff the hell up.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.296
What are we gonna do,
disguise ourselves
as German officers?

15:17.377 --> 15:18.458
Exactly.

15:19.749 --> 15:21.541
(CHUCKLES) All right.
What the hell
are you talking about?

15:21.541 --> 15:24.424
I'm saying,
we wear the uniform
of the enemy.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.256
Bridesmaids.

15:26.546 --> 15:28.098
She already has
her bridesmaids.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.310
Okay, then two of them
"have a little accident."

15:30.680 --> 15:32.142
Parker,

15:32.142 --> 15:34.975
if anyone deserves to be
knocked down a couple
of pegs, it's Caitlyn.

15:34.975 --> 15:38.478
Rachel had one thing
she loved in life
and Caitlyn took it.

15:39.059 --> 15:40.520
Are you really gonna
let her get away
with that?

15:41.021 --> 15:43.113
Do you really think
we could take down
Caitlyn?

15:43.984 --> 15:45.485
And do you think
we could stop
this wedding?

15:45.485 --> 15:46.616
We can do anything. Why?

15:46.616 --> 15:48.948
Because we're
sophisticated babes
from New York.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.070
Or as Miss Olivia
would put it,

15:50.570 --> 15:53.413
"You girls are just
a little too thinky."

15:53.413 --> 15:54.494
All right.

15:55.035 --> 15:56.956
I'm starting to like it.

15:57.667 --> 15:58.788
Caitlyn is going down.

15:58.788 --> 16:00.130
Yes!

16:00.130 --> 16:02.132
The Thinky Girls
are back.
Yes!

16:02.132 --> 16:03.423
To love.
To Rachel.

16:03.423 --> 16:05.085
To the defeat of
the Third Reich!

16:05.085 --> 16:06.466
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:17.857 --> 16:20.690
Mmm.
Girls, you're so right.

16:20.690 --> 16:23.863
This is the best
frozen yogurt
in all of Lambert.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.865
Told you.

16:27.107 --> 16:29.369
Aren't you glad
you called us?

16:29.739 --> 16:30.990
So glad.

16:31.531 --> 16:34.034
We owe you Ashleys.
We really owe them.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.747
Yeah, but what can
we give them that
they don't have?

16:38.788 --> 16:41.461
(SIGHS) Huh... Well...

16:41.881 --> 16:42.962
How's it going up
at the house?

16:42.962 --> 16:45.715
You guys getting along
with Olivia?

16:45.715 --> 16:46.796
It's okay.

16:46.796 --> 16:48.048
Yeah. Not so bad.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.010
Ashleys! Come on.
We're yogurt pals now.

16:51.891 --> 16:52.842
Share.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.225
We can't do
anything right.

16:55.225 --> 16:56.846
She's always
on our case.

16:56.846 --> 16:58.768
And she treats us
like we're big dopes.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.400
Can you believe that?

17:02.142 --> 17:03.903
This is how
we can help them.

17:03.903 --> 17:05.605
You mean
our secret Olivia tip?

17:06.445 --> 17:08.738
You're right.
Yeah, she always liked us.

17:08.738 --> 17:09.608
Really?

17:09.608 --> 17:10.780
Look, girls,
you have to understand.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.532
I mean, Olivia's
under a lot of
pressure right now,

17:13.532 --> 17:15.075
wedding
and everything.
BOTH: Uh-huh.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.705
Is she drinking?

17:16.705 --> 17:17.747
Yes. Constantly.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.749
That's what happens.
ABIGAIL: Yeah,
here's the trick.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.662
When she's drinking,
tell her to slow down.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.795
Like, in front
of everybody?

17:25.795 --> 17:26.965
That's the only way
it works.

17:28.428 --> 17:30.800
What we used to do
is we would count her drinks
and then we'd let her know.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.801
Mmm-hmm.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.633
PARKER: She'd always
thank us in the morning.

17:33.633 --> 17:34.764
We could do that.
Yeah, we could.

17:34.764 --> 17:36.766
Do it, you'll be golden.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.768
How's the frozen yogurt?

17:38.768 --> 17:40.140
It's really cold.
(LAUGHS)

17:40.140 --> 17:41.771
If I eat it too fast,
my brain freezes.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.143
(BOTH ASHLEYS CHUCKLE)

17:43.143 --> 17:44.604
How can you tell?

17:47.607 --> 17:48.948
And the trap is set.

17:48.948 --> 17:51.030
Their poor frozen brains
never stood a chance.

17:51.030 --> 17:53.493
Well, you pick up
a few skills when
you live in the big city.

17:53.493 --> 17:55.074
How the world works.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.866
Oh, my God,
they're towing
my mom's car!

17:56.866 --> 17:57.697
No! Hey!

17:59.619 --> 18:00.790
Hey, what are you doing?

18:04.874 --> 18:06.126
Where did that
come from?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.797
Been up there
for about three years.

18:07.797 --> 18:10.800
Okay, well, we didn't
know 'cause we don't
live here anymore.

18:10.800 --> 18:11.881
We live in New York City.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.180
Hey, Dougie,
how's it going?

18:20.890 --> 18:22.772
Livin' the dream, Henry.
How about you?

18:22.772 --> 18:25.145
I'm good.
Can you give me a sec?

18:25.685 --> 18:26.686
(SIGHS)

18:28.528 --> 18:29.989
There's your boy.
Okay.

18:29.989 --> 18:31.821
(INAUDIBLE)

18:33.323 --> 18:34.614
My mistake.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.736
It turns out
you can park here

18:36.736 --> 18:38.538
if you're back in town for
your parents' anniversary.

18:39.329 --> 18:40.870
So cute.
Okay.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.124
So cute.

18:47.747 --> 18:49.008
Hi.
Hi.

18:55.014 --> 18:57.177
You know, I think I lost
something somewhere.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.260
I'm gonna go look for it
in case I did.

19:02.021 --> 19:03.183
I like your friend.

19:04.814 --> 19:05.935
How did you do that?

19:05.935 --> 19:07.727
I pulled a thorn
out of his paw
a few years back.

19:08.358 --> 19:10.770
Or I'm a cop and
Dougie owes me a favor.

19:10.770 --> 19:11.861
You're a cop?

19:12.862 --> 19:14.614
Wow, that sounded awful.
I'm...

19:15.154 --> 19:16.196
Let me try that again.

19:16.696 --> 19:18.198
Oh, so you're in
law enforcement?

19:18.198 --> 19:19.869
That sounds like
very important work.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.242
That wasn't
much better either.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.833
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

19:23.833 --> 19:25.995
I like seeing
you rattled. It's cute.

19:27.247 --> 19:28.288
So, listen, Parker...

19:28.708 --> 19:29.709
Look, I...

19:29.999 --> 19:31.170
I think you're
really nice

19:31.170 --> 19:32.882
and I so appreciate
what you just did
right there,

19:32.882 --> 19:34.133
but I don't think
it would be smart for...

19:34.133 --> 19:35.925
Take it easy.
Nobody's asking
anybody out.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.217
Oh.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.678
Just wanna say
be sure you read

19:38.678 --> 19:41.060
all of our small-town
parking signs,

19:41.221 --> 19:43.893
and you have
yourself a safe trip
back to the big city.

19:45.265 --> 19:46.266
Okay?

19:49.359 --> 19:50.770
That's it?

19:54.073 --> 19:57.737
My mother's
great grandfather
built Bellefontaine

19:57.737 --> 19:59.239
with his own
two hands.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.702
Oh, Mr. Woodward,
it would be such
an honor

20:02.702 --> 20:03.993
to have it grace
the cover of your magazine.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.746
Now, I'm just
writing the article,
Miss Caitlyn.

20:06.746 --> 20:08.998
I can't
guarantee you a cover.

20:08.998 --> 20:10.920
Well, I see there are
no weight restrictions

20:10.920 --> 20:12.211
on the brides
you feature.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.134
That gown must've
taken all the lace
in England that year.

20:15.134 --> 20:17.337
That's the Governor's
niece you're referring to.

20:17.927 --> 20:19.259
She has a lovely
complexion.

20:19.929 --> 20:20.930
Mmm.

20:22.762 --> 20:23.803
(CLEARING THROAT)

20:23.803 --> 20:25.345
Did you know,
Mr. Woodward,

20:25.345 --> 20:27.897
that all the bridesmaids
are living here
at Bellefontaine

20:27.897 --> 20:28.768
right up until
the wedding?

20:29.689 --> 20:31.271
And staying at such
a magnificent home,

20:31.651 --> 20:34.354
why, it's like living
in a fairyland.

20:34.354 --> 20:35.985
(ALL CHUCKLING)

20:37.777 --> 20:39.118
(WHISPERS) Now you.
Oh, yes.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.912
You know, all the girls
are staying right here
at Bellefontaine

20:42.912 --> 20:43.783
up until the wedding.

20:47.867 --> 20:49.709
I said that part.
And um...

20:51.040 --> 20:52.211
Snowglobe.
Yes.

20:53.132 --> 20:55.795
This home is so beautiful,
isn't it?

20:55.795 --> 20:57.377
It's like an idyllic scene
in a snowglobe.

20:57.837 --> 20:58.548
Oh!

20:58.548 --> 21:01.090
That is so sweet
of you to say.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.302
More sherry, anyone?

21:02.302 --> 21:04.093
Oh, yes, precious,
I believe I will.

21:04.684 --> 21:05.725
Number three!

21:06.686 --> 21:07.887
I beg your pardon?

21:07.887 --> 21:09.389
Oh, that's your
third glass of sherry.

21:09.389 --> 21:10.890
Actually,
it's her fourth.

21:10.890 --> 21:12.812
She had a little nip
in the kitchen.

21:13.152 --> 21:14.654
But I think
that was scotch.

21:16.155 --> 21:17.397
What are you doing?

21:17.397 --> 21:18.698
Helping.

21:18.698 --> 21:19.779
We know you're under
a lot of pressure,

21:19.779 --> 21:21.901
and we certainly don't
want to see you
get hammered

21:21.901 --> 21:23.282
like you did
Wednesday night.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.864
When you fell
into the duck pond.

21:24.864 --> 21:26.326
And told the gardener
your hedge needed trimming.

21:26.996 --> 21:29.909
So, we'll be here
counting your drinks
every day.

21:29.909 --> 21:32.332
And night,
when you really
go to town.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.874
How thoughtful of you.

21:37.717 --> 21:38.878
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

21:43.222 --> 21:45.845
I think those girls
gave us bad advice.

21:45.845 --> 21:47.887
Boy, I think
you're right.

22:03.282 --> 22:06.245
Well, apparently,
some of Caitlyn's
old rivals

22:06.245 --> 22:09.038
were pulling some
silly sorority stunt.

22:09.038 --> 22:12.372
(LAUGHING) Oh,
why thank you, Mr. Woodward,
I knew you'd understand.

22:12.372 --> 22:15.294
So, we'll see you
and your photographer
tomorrow morning?

22:15.294 --> 22:18.007
Wonderful. Okay.
Bye, now.

22:18.007 --> 22:19.008
Oh! Mama!

22:19.258 --> 22:21.801
(EXCLAIMING)
Fantastic news!

22:21.801 --> 22:23.763
Abby and Parker have
changed their plans.

22:23.763 --> 22:26.466
Because of me!
They're going to stay
in town for the wedding.

22:26.466 --> 22:28.267
Isn't that
just the best?

22:28.267 --> 22:29.178
Mmm.

22:29.178 --> 22:30.520
Oh, don't worry,
we'll sit in the back.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.731
We're not going to
make a peep.

22:31.731 --> 22:33.312
PARKER: Yeah,
we don't even need
to be in the photos.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.314
(LAUGHING) It's not like
we're bridesmaids
or anything.

22:35.314 --> 22:36.816
Oh, my gosh.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.778
Lightbulb!

22:38.778 --> 22:40.780
What if you
were bridesmaids?

22:41.070 --> 22:42.321
No!
I mean, it would...

22:42.321 --> 22:44.444
Yes!
It would be a dream
come true.

22:44.444 --> 22:45.825
PARKER: Yeah.

22:45.825 --> 22:48.157
Caitlyn, may I have
a word with you?

22:50.910 --> 22:51.911
(GIGGLES)

22:56.295 --> 22:58.297

They are not
bridesmaid material.

22:58.297 --> 22:59.499
Mom, it's okay.

22:59.499 --> 23:01.841

It's my wedding and
I want my bridesmaids.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.886

23:09.098 --> 23:10.309
Mother?

23:10.850 --> 23:13.813
We would be
honored if you would...

23:16.896 --> 23:19.398
Oh, for gosh sakes.
You're my new bridesmaids!

23:20.069 --> 23:21.110
No way!

23:21.110 --> 23:22.111
Yay!
Shut up!

23:23.112 --> 23:25.074
Yes, yes, yes!
Amazing!

23:26.446 --> 23:28.528
PARKER: Okay, here we are.

23:31.581 --> 23:33.202
Got cherubs?

23:34.163 --> 23:36.295
There's something
I've learned in life,

23:36.295 --> 23:37.917
you can never have
too many cherubs.

23:39.629 --> 23:42.632
All right, Sarge,
we're behind
enemy lines. What's next?

23:42.632 --> 23:43.883
Why are you asking me?

23:44.343 --> 23:45.885
Because you're the plotter.

23:45.885 --> 23:47.426
Didn't Publishers Weekly
call you inventive?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.809
"Abigail Scanlon
is in full command
of her narrative."

23:50.470 --> 23:51.811
I will give you that one.

23:51.811 --> 23:56.225
All right, break up
the couple. Break up
the wedding couple.

23:56.225 --> 23:59.438
(GASPS) I got it!
You sleep with the groom.

23:59.649 --> 24:01.981
Huh, yeah. We help
our friend Rachel

24:01.981 --> 24:03.983
by me sleeping
with the love
of her life.

24:04.233 --> 24:06.826
Hey, I never said
there wouldn't be
any casualties.

24:07.406 --> 24:10.159
(GASPS) Uh...
You sleep with Caitlyn.

24:10.409 --> 24:12.532
Why do all of your plans
have me sleeping
with someone?

24:12.532 --> 24:13.663
Is this how you see me?

24:13.663 --> 24:14.624
A little bit.

24:14.624 --> 24:17.036
All right. Well,
if Tony's like most guys,

24:17.036 --> 24:20.249
me and Caitlyn
in bed together
will not be a deal breaker.

24:20.249 --> 24:21.460
I wonder where
they have Rachel stashed?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.883
Probably in the
"Ha, ha, stole
your boyfriend" room.

24:23.883 --> 24:25.214
No, she's
in the Persimmon Room.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.175
How do you know?

24:26.175 --> 24:29.008
Oh, it's right here,
under "Room Assignments"

24:29.008 --> 24:30.930
in the Bridesmaids' News.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.642
Oh, of course.

24:32.642 --> 24:36.435
An in-home published
newspaper about
your very own wedding.

24:36.435 --> 24:37.687
Guess who made
the cover? Caitlyn.

24:37.687 --> 24:40.189
You know,
I really think that
we're over-thinking this.

24:40.189 --> 24:41.561
If we want to get
Rachel and Tony
back together,

24:41.561 --> 24:43.693
well, let's just get
Rachel and Tony
back together.

24:43.693 --> 24:45.525
We can fix her up a bit,

24:45.525 --> 24:47.987
boost her confidence,
and then throw 'em
in a room together.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.660
They were cooking before.
Come on, let's turn up
the flame a little bit,

24:50.660 --> 24:53.032
and then I do not
have to sleep
with anyone.

24:53.032 --> 24:54.203
You okay with that?

24:54.203 --> 24:56.415
Oh, behold!

you guys doing here?

with your room, girls?

No, I just wanted to
check out the
Persimmon Room.

the newsletter that
lights out is 11:00 p.m.

Mmm-hmm.

I know why you're here.
I know exactly
what you're planning.

25:37.657 --> 25:40.209
You think being
a bridesmaid
is a little game.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.582
You're here to
laugh at our expense.

25:42.582 --> 25:46.085

what we're doing here
very seriously.

the sacred trust that Caitlyn
has bestowed upon you.

We do understand
each other, don't we?

Yeah.
Good.

we've had this little talk.

get to bed.

Oh, and there's
so much more after that.

27:00.950 --> 27:02.792
Y'all need to
get moving, okay?

27:02.792 --> 27:04.834
Let's go! Chop-chop! Bye!

27:05.835 --> 27:09.919
She keeps this up,
this is gonna need
an obituary page.

27:10.169 --> 27:11.170
(SIGHS)

27:13.843 --> 27:16.926
Well, being selected
Caitlyn's maid of honor

27:16.926 --> 27:19.759
is so completely
the most important thing

27:19.759 --> 27:22.021
that has ever happened
in my entire

27:23.352 --> 27:24.603
life.

27:24.603 --> 27:25.604
Oh!

27:25.855 --> 27:27.106
I'm sorry.

27:27.106 --> 27:30.860
It's just ever since
we were freshmen rushes
at Gamma Kappa,

27:32.862 --> 27:35.324
Caitlyn and I
have been like sisters.
More than sisters.

27:35.324 --> 27:39.538
We're like two big halves
of one big Siamese twin.

27:41.701 --> 27:42.661
(LAUGHS)

27:42.661 --> 27:44.283
The funny thing is,
she's happier than we are.

27:45.584 --> 27:46.706
Morning, ladies.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.207
Hey.
Oh, okay.

27:49.879 --> 27:51.670
(IN SINGSONG VOICE)
Okay, girls.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.883
The better the interviews,
the more likely we are
to get the cover.

27:54.093 --> 27:56.796
I hope you're both thinking of
lots of colorful anecdotes.

27:56.796 --> 27:58.177
Yeah, that's what
we're doing over here.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.890
Yeah, I tried a couple of
jokes on the butler.
Freakin' killed.

28:00.890 --> 28:06.185
(LAUGHS) Oh, Abigail,
you're just a regular, old
Dane Cook sometimes.

28:06.856 --> 28:09.148
But seriously,
when it's your turn
to be interviewed,

28:09.148 --> 28:13.022
please, no frowny faces,
no sassy attitude,

28:13.022 --> 28:14.693
and remember,
you are the bridal support.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.695
And, oh, dear God,
please, none of that
other thing you do.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.987
Oh, you mean sarcasm?

28:17.987 --> 28:18.818
None of that.

28:19.869 --> 28:21.200
Caitlyn, I could never be
sarcastic with you.

28:22.081 --> 28:23.242
Thank you.

28:23.242 --> 28:26.085
Here we are, ladies.
Eggs Benedict

28:26.085 --> 28:28.828
with a rasher of applewood
smoked bacon for Miss Parker.

28:29.288 --> 28:34.213
And for Miss Abigail,
spelt toast, dry,
and soy bacon bits.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.215
This spelt toast,
what, that means
somebody ate it already?

28:36.215 --> 28:37.757
OLIVIA:
I'll take care of this.

28:37.757 --> 28:43.102
Abigail, our bridesmaids
dresses aren't going to
impress in the plus sizes.

28:43.102 --> 28:44.894
And we think,
with a little work,

28:44.894 --> 28:46.055
you could lose
10 pounds this week.

28:46.846 --> 28:47.937

28:48.938 --> 28:50.269
Now, it's not just diet,

28:50.269 --> 28:52.691
we're bringing in
a personal trainer for you.

28:52.691 --> 28:55.274
And trust me,
she is a miracle worker.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.156
I need a miracle?

28:57.156 --> 28:58.697
Look, I know
you don't want to
hear this right now,

28:58.697 --> 29:00.990
but this is seriously
the best eggs Benedict
that I've ever had.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.783
RACHEL:
We've been best friends
since kindergarten.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.624
Abigail, Parker and Caitlyn.

29:08.828 --> 29:11.831
We used to play wedding,
right there on that lawn.

29:12.792 --> 29:13.963
And now
it's a real wedding.

29:13.963 --> 29:14.964
Yes. It is.

29:15.294 --> 29:18.137
When you see
Caitlyn and Tony together,

29:18.137 --> 29:20.759
bride and groom,
how does that
make you feel?

29:21.971 --> 29:23.092
Um...

29:24.303 --> 29:25.304
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

29:32.271 --> 29:33.853
I'm so, so sorry.

dear friend she is.

They used to run after
each other like that
when they were children.

Hey, how those
eggs Benedict
treating you right now, huh?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.140
Oh, I figured
they'd ask me
about Caitlyn,

30:11.140 --> 30:13.522
but I did not think
they would ask me
about Tony.

30:13.522 --> 30:14.693
(WHIRRING)

30:14.693 --> 30:17.236
Look, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna fix everything.

30:17.236 --> 30:20.149
Excuse me! We're trying
to have a conversation!

30:20.149 --> 30:21.280
Can you wrap it up?

30:21.530 --> 30:22.862
(WHIRRING STOPS)

30:22.862 --> 30:24.864
Thank you.
You're a prince.

30:25.534 --> 30:27.116
What do you mean
you're gonna
fix everything?

30:27.116 --> 30:29.208
That's why the Ashleys
are gone and we're here.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.369
You did that?
Yes,
we did.

30:30.369 --> 30:32.451
And we did it for you.
We're gonna help you
get Tony back.

30:32.451 --> 30:34.753
So spruce it on up, girl.
You gotta look pretty.

30:34.753 --> 30:36.255

fall in love with you
all over again.

30:36.255 --> 30:37.216
No, he can't.

30:37.216 --> 30:39.458
Yes, he can. Come on,
there's still plenty...

30:39.458 --> 30:40.960
No, they have to
get married.

30:40.960 --> 30:41.760
Whose side are you on?

30:41.760 --> 30:42.882
It's a secret.
It's a big secret.

30:42.882 --> 30:44.513
I'm not supposed to
tell anyone, so I can't!
Spill it!

30:44.513 --> 30:45.804
Caitlyn's pregnant.

30:46.225 --> 30:47.266
What?

30:47.967 --> 30:49.058
And it's Tony's.

So they have to get married.

cannot grow up
without a daddy.

30:59.478 --> 31:02.441
RACHEL: It always felt weird
with me and Tony's family.

31:02.441 --> 31:05.574
They think anybody
who isn't rich like them
is some sort of gold-digger.

31:05.574 --> 31:06.906
But that isn't me.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.157
Oh, we know, honey.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.409
They made me feel
so uncomfortable.

31:10.409 --> 31:12.541
Then one day,
Tony made this joke

31:12.541 --> 31:15.915
about how I liked
their big sailboat,
and I lost it.

31:15.915 --> 31:19.418
I said, "If that's what you
think I am, then we should
just break up right now."

31:19.418 --> 31:22.881
I didn't mean it.
I was just upset and mad.

31:23.422 --> 31:26.926
When I finally got up
the nerve to call
and say I was sorry,

31:26.926 --> 31:28.968
somebody else
had swooped in
and grabbed him.

31:28.968 --> 31:32.011
Hmm. Yeah, let me guess.
Our lifelong friend
Caitlyn.

31:32.011 --> 31:33.973
Yeah. She threw
herself at him.

31:33.973 --> 31:35.474
Under him,
more likely.

31:35.474 --> 31:38.227
He only slept
with her once,
but that was enough.

31:38.227 --> 31:39.358
Mmm-hmm.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.570
Yeah, just like my mom
always said.

31:41.570 --> 31:42.651
How do you know
she was pregnant?

31:42.651 --> 31:45.904
She told me.
She said she went
to Dr. Wallach.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.027
They did a test. Baby.

31:48.027 --> 31:49.828
So now they have to
get married.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.411
Tony's doing
the right thing.

31:53.832 --> 31:55.414
He always does
the right thing.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.297
Except playing
that game of
happy-slappy with Caitlyn.

you will not
break up this wedding.

we promise.

that gold-digger's pregnant

32:12.431 --> 32:13.892
and it's a shotgun wedding?

more traditional
all the time.

32:16.315 --> 32:17.816

Nothing. We just buck up
and be sweet little

and his groomsmen.

Your mother never kept
her husbands for very long,

32:41.500 --> 32:44.003

how to get them
to show up on time

37:29.498 --> 37:30.579
Cold spaghetti?

37:30.579 --> 37:31.790
Give it to me.

37:33.582 --> 37:35.714
Mmm.
Mmm-hmm. Nuh-uh.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.296
Okay.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.299
Remember when
we used to sneak down
that secret passageway

37:40.299 --> 37:41.550
and make snacks
for movie night?

37:41.550 --> 37:43.552
(LAUGHS) Always
the same snacks,
right?

37:43.552 --> 37:46.435
It was s'mores
and pink lemonade.

37:46.725 --> 37:47.646
And always the same movie.

37:47.646 --> 37:49.768
BOTH: An Officer
and a Gentleman.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.851
For two years,
that's the only movie Caitlyn
would ever let us watch.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.354
Oh, my God, that's it.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.567
Okay,
Caitlyn's not pregnant.

37:58.857 --> 38:01.700
Ready?
Officer and a Gentleman,

38:01.700 --> 38:03.902
Lisa Eilbacher
pretended to be pregnant

38:03.902 --> 38:06.495
so that David Keith
will marry her.

38:06.825 --> 38:10.959
Caitlyn is Lisa Eilbacher.
Oh, it's so obvious.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.792
She went to
Dr. Wallach, Abigail.
She got a test.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.003
No. Mmm-mmm.
I don't think she did.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.795
I think Caitlyn is lying.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.046
Okay, you might need
a little proof of that.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.799
I'll get you some proof,
Little Miss Skeptical No Butt.

38:21.470 --> 38:22.881
We move at dawn.

38:22.881 --> 38:24.843
Let's get going,
we need our sleep. Let's go!

38:24.843 --> 38:26.425
And I need my spaghetti.

38:27.726 --> 38:28.767
Oh, yeah.

38:30.849 --> 38:31.850
PARKER: Oh!

38:39.698 --> 38:41.700
KELTON: Well,
good morning, bridesmaids.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.612
What are you ladies up to?

38:43.942 --> 38:46.745
Uh, we were just
gonna go into town.

38:46.745 --> 38:47.866
Yeah, I need to
run an errand.

38:47.866 --> 38:50.078
You know,
Miss Olivia doesn't like
people driving off,

38:50.078 --> 38:51.329
doing their own thing, now.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.791
I need tampons.

38:54.292 --> 38:56.044
Well, have a good day.

39:02.761 --> 39:03.882
ABIGAIL: Bye!

39:07.175 --> 39:08.847
Hi, how are you?

39:09.347 --> 39:10.348
Come on.

39:16.184 --> 39:18.687
Hi, we're here from, uh...

39:20.238 --> 39:21.480
Filex Cabinets.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.280
Uh-huh.

39:22.941 --> 39:25.904
Yes. You obviously
got the recall notice.

39:26.154 --> 39:27.245
The what?

39:27.245 --> 39:29.828
The recall notice, sweetheart.
Don't you read the news?

39:29.828 --> 39:32.831
Yeah, a lot of
our filing cabinets
have been collapsing.

39:32.831 --> 39:36.705
Apparently the titanium
brackets have a little
too much alloy in them.

39:36.705 --> 39:37.706
Yeah, way too much.

39:38.707 --> 39:40.709
These cabinets
were purchased
after 1970?

39:40.919 --> 39:42.761
Um, I started here in June.

39:43.842 --> 39:45.844
Then we need to
check those, don't we?

39:49.177 --> 39:50.889
Okay. Let's go.
(DOOR BUZZING)

39:51.510 --> 39:53.351
I'm gonna pick
a file at random.

39:53.351 --> 39:54.853
You know what,
how about "M"?

39:54.853 --> 39:57.315
"M." Middle letter.
Very wise.

39:57.516 --> 40:01.860
Oh, my God.
Those glasses are so cute.

40:01.860 --> 40:02.901
Thank you.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.322
They must have been
really expensive.

40:04.322 --> 40:05.944
No, I bought them online.

40:05.944 --> 40:07.155
$20.

40:07.155 --> 40:11.079
Get out of here!
Would it be okay
if I tried them on?

40:11.790 --> 40:12.791
Oh.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.242
Thanks.

40:16.875 --> 40:20.298
Oh. Wow, they're so comfy.
How do I look?

40:21.880 --> 40:24.132
Blurry.
I can't see a thing
without my glasses.

40:24.132 --> 40:25.884
(BOTH LAUGHING)

40:26.214 --> 40:28.046
Have you ever tried contacts?

40:28.046 --> 40:30.929
Because, you know,
your eyes are really pretty.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.391
Oh, I did,
but don't they hurt?

40:33.892 --> 40:35.894
Beauty is pain, girlfriend!

40:36.855 --> 40:37.856
(EXCLAIMING ANGRILY)
She's pregnant!

40:40.819 --> 40:42.861
That's just an expression
that we use to mean

40:42.861 --> 40:46.274
that this cabinet is
crazy full and
it's about to go.

40:46.274 --> 40:48.827
So, we need to
get that report in
right away.

40:48.827 --> 40:50.368
Absolutely.
Okay.

40:50.368 --> 40:51.910
Here are your glasses.
Thank you.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.496
Stay clear of those.

What about
An Officer and a Gentleman?

41:13.972 --> 41:17.936
Just like every other
romantic movie, okay?
It let us down.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.483
ALL: Mmm. Mmm.

41:27.025 --> 41:28.777
That was the orange ginger.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.913
Bitsy, don't copy off me.

41:36.034 --> 41:37.035
I wasn't!

41:37.035 --> 41:39.538
Girls, do I have to
separate the two of you?

41:39.538 --> 41:42.040
This next one
is red velvet.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.882
Very daring
for a wedding.

41:47.085 --> 41:48.386
What do you think, honey?

41:48.386 --> 41:49.548
It's really good.
I like it.

41:50.889 --> 41:52.841
Men. Put food
in their mouths
and that's all they need.

41:53.301 --> 41:55.513
Not all. At least not
in my experience.

41:55.934 --> 41:57.435
Which is no doubt
extensive.

41:58.847 --> 42:02.561
You like it? Sweetheart,
that's what you said
about the last three.

42:03.141 --> 42:05.313
I like cake. All cake.

42:05.604 --> 42:07.525
Cake and me,
we just get along.

42:09.147 --> 42:12.911
Tony-Bear, participate.

42:12.911 --> 42:14.913
Come on, we need
an opinion from the groom.

42:22.080 --> 42:25.333
Look, Caitlyn,
I'm doing what
everybody wants here.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.164
It's just cake.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.548
Yes, you do like milk
with your cake.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.380
Why don't you go
get some milk, hmm?

42:32.671 --> 42:33.882
I think I will.

42:35.974 --> 42:37.225
He's just getting
some milk.

42:41.309 --> 42:42.891
OLIVIA: Well, if he's
going to have milk,

42:42.891 --> 42:44.352
I think we should all
have a sherry.

42:45.183 --> 42:46.184
Mmm.

42:51.279 --> 42:52.490
Oh. Uh...
Oh.

42:52.490 --> 42:54.192
Sorry. Bye.
(STAMMERING)

42:54.192 --> 42:56.865
Rach, don't go.

43:01.539 --> 43:04.542
It's okay. We can be
in the same room together.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.877
No, I don't think we can.

43:09.417 --> 43:10.629
Do you hate me that much?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.211
Is that what you think?

43:15.093 --> 43:17.716
I'm trying not to
think anymore.

43:17.716 --> 43:20.889
I'm just doing
what I have to do.

43:23.221 --> 43:24.933
One stupid mistake,

43:24.933 --> 43:27.275
and I'm gonna be
paying for it
for the rest of my life.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.115
I miss you so much.

43:39.537 --> 43:43.501
And I'm the one
who messed this up,

43:43.501 --> 43:45.704
and I wish
I could go back.
But it's too late.

43:45.704 --> 43:46.915
Rachel.

43:48.707 --> 43:49.918
I love you.

43:52.420 --> 43:53.591
I always will.

43:53.591 --> 43:55.253
(SOFTLY)
I love you, too.

43:56.464 --> 43:58.927
There's not much
we can do about it, though.

44:00.058 --> 44:01.519
It's just nice to know.

44:02.681 --> 44:06.644
CAITLYN: Tony-Bear!
This carrot cake
is to die for!

44:19.617 --> 44:22.781
And then we both said
we still love each other.

No, no.
It's not wonderful.

of wonderful.

there are some
little kids playing outside,

44:42.260 --> 44:44.302
why don't you go out there
and tell 'em they're
all gonna die someday?

44:45.063 --> 44:47.435
Okay. What are we all
doing here, seriously?

44:47.435 --> 44:49.687
We're miserable.
We should just crash
the gate and go.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.359
No! You can't go.

44:51.359 --> 44:52.610
If you all left,
I'd be a mess.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.983
We don't want that
to happen now, do we?

44:56.694 --> 44:57.615
Go wash your face.

44:57.615 --> 44:58.616
Okay.

45:01.239 --> 45:02.490
We cannot leave her.

45:02.490 --> 45:03.822
Then what
are we gonna do?

45:03.822 --> 45:05.623
We can't break up
a wedding if we can't
break up the couple.

45:05.623 --> 45:08.206
Oh, don't worry
about it, okay?
I will find a way.

45:08.206 --> 45:12.670
Why? Because
I'm Abigail Scanlon,

49:03.561 --> 49:04.652
(BOTH LAUGHING)

49:04.983 --> 49:06.324
Do that move again.

49:06.324 --> 49:07.325
(BOTH LAUGHING)

49:08.366 --> 49:10.368
CAITLYN: Yay!
Abigail's here.
BITSY: Yay!

49:11.949 --> 49:13.621
RACHEL: Uh-oh!

49:14.993 --> 49:16.534
(IN SINGSONG VOICE)
I have a date.

49:19.707 --> 49:21.419
WOMAN: ♪ Want to ask you
something, man

49:25.083 --> 49:26.464
MAN: ♪ Here we go! ♪

49:27.755 --> 49:29.797
If you hadn't called me,
right now I'd be
pasting baby pictures

49:29.797 --> 49:31.759
of Caitlyn on a page
called, "Cute as a Button."

49:31.759 --> 49:33.721
They're pretty hard-core
up there, huh?

49:33.721 --> 49:35.393
We wear matching pajamas.

49:35.393 --> 49:36.394
Ooh.

49:37.685 --> 49:40.018
So, I'm still a little curious
as to why you stuck around
in town.

49:40.018 --> 49:41.769
I quickly ruled out
interest in me.

49:42.690 --> 49:45.063
Because we're worried
about Rachel.
This is awful for her.

49:45.063 --> 49:47.025
She's not even close to
being over Tony.

49:48.776 --> 49:51.279
Sort of a sensitive area
for a friend of the groom.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.531
Sorry. You wanna
change the subject?

49:53.741 --> 49:55.703
Nah. I mean,
I know what's going on.

49:55.703 --> 49:56.994
I know why
they're really
getting married.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.786
Oh, yeah,
secretly pregnant bride.

49:58.786 --> 50:00.788
What a cliche.
What?

50:01.379 --> 50:02.420
She's pregnant?

50:02.420 --> 50:04.962
Oh, no.
No, please don't tell
anyone I told you.

50:04.962 --> 50:08.386
It's okay.
'Cause I'm joking.
Everybody knows.

50:09.087 --> 50:10.678
I'm serious.
The busboy knows.

50:10.678 --> 50:12.680
Hey, Javier!
Who's pregnant?

50:12.680 --> 50:13.841
Miss Caitlyn.

50:17.805 --> 50:21.399
All right, well,
I told you about Rachel.

50:21.399 --> 50:23.481
So what's Tony's story?

50:23.481 --> 50:25.643
Tony's a stand-up guy.

50:25.643 --> 50:26.694
He's doing
what he has to do.

50:27.565 --> 50:29.407
But is he happy
about it?

50:29.407 --> 50:31.739
Um, let's see. No.

50:33.571 --> 50:34.702
When he found out
she was pregnant,

50:34.702 --> 50:35.913
he put his fist
through a wall.

50:36.994 --> 50:39.617
But then he realized
this is Lambert,
Louisiana,

50:39.617 --> 50:43.791
it's 1870, and the options
are "get married"
or "get married now."

50:44.001 --> 50:46.084
So he's biting his lip
and taking his punishment.

50:46.504 --> 50:48.166
This is just one big
misery fest, isn't it?

50:48.166 --> 50:49.797
Yeah.

50:49.797 --> 50:52.760
In fact, I would
probably have to say
that meeting you

50:53.841 --> 50:55.933
is the only good thing
to come out of this
whole lousy wedding.

50:56.174 --> 50:57.805
Look, Henry,

50:57.805 --> 50:59.677
I leave for New York
the day after the wedding.

50:59.677 --> 51:01.349
And there's not much time.
And I sort of have this rule

51:01.349 --> 51:02.520
where I don't
sleep with a guy

51:02.520 --> 51:03.561
until I've known him
for three weeks.

51:03.561 --> 51:04.562
Parker?

51:04.812 --> 51:05.943
Yeah?

51:05.943 --> 51:06.984
It's just dinner.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.899
Although, if I happen
to find myself in New York

51:11.899 --> 51:14.652
in, I don't know,
exactly three weeks, then...

51:26.704 --> 51:27.705
Hey!

51:28.045 --> 51:29.837
How was the date
with the cop?

51:29.837 --> 51:32.470
Did he frisk you?
Did he find anything?

51:32.470 --> 51:33.471
It was awful.

51:34.472 --> 51:35.633
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I thought that was solid.

51:35.633 --> 51:39.096
No, he's great.
Possibly better than great.

51:39.096 --> 51:41.719
And he likes me.
Oh, God.

51:41.979 --> 51:45.062
Well, why don't
you stick around
and see what happens?

51:45.563 --> 51:47.725
Because I live
in New York City.
My career is there.

51:47.725 --> 51:49.106
Which I don't even have.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.729
I didn't tell you this,
but my agent, Alice,
dumped me yesterday

51:51.729 --> 51:54.782
in an email
which she signed
"Love." (LAUGHS)

51:55.653 --> 51:56.734
So I'm going home
to nothing

51:56.734 --> 51:59.497
and I'm leaving
this adorable guy here.

52:00.538 --> 52:01.829
Olivia has me
so carb-starved

52:01.829 --> 52:03.951
that if you put
your sweet hand
on a kaiser roll,

52:03.951 --> 52:05.873
I'd eat it in three bites.

52:07.705 --> 52:09.797
Out of the two of us,
who do you think
is more pathetic?

52:09.797 --> 52:11.088
I need BAND-AIDs.

52:11.088 --> 52:14.011
We were scrapbooking
last night and I got
all these paper cuts.

52:14.011 --> 52:15.092
We have a winner.

52:15.092 --> 52:17.925
(SIGHS) What a
super morning it is!

52:17.925 --> 52:20.178
I just saw a redbird
outside my window.

52:21.018 --> 52:23.931
You know, Bitsy.
I hope we all
stay in touch

52:23.931 --> 52:25.062
when this week is over.

52:27.104 --> 52:29.687
Girls, breakfast
is on the patio,
not in the kitchen.

52:30.478 --> 52:31.529
Is Caitlyn out there?

52:32.860 --> 52:34.402
No. Our bride-to-be
is not feeling at all
well this morning.

52:34.692 --> 52:37.114
I thought I heard her
throwing up. Is she okay?

52:37.775 --> 52:38.826
Well, these things happen.

52:38.826 --> 52:40.618
Mmm, morning sickness.

52:40.618 --> 52:41.909
Oh, yeah.

52:41.909 --> 52:44.582
Or somebody and her
maid of honor were
up late last night

52:44.582 --> 52:46.744
doing mucho, mucho
tequila shots.

52:49.046 --> 52:51.048
Pregnant girls
don't do tequila shots.

52:52.790 --> 52:54.212
Unless they're
not pregnant.

53:02.139 --> 53:05.353
Bitsy, you need
to tell us the truth.

53:06.434 --> 53:07.605
Mmm-mmm.

53:07.605 --> 53:10.308
It'll be much easier
on you if you just talk.

53:10.478 --> 53:11.979
Anything yet?
No.

53:12.770 --> 53:13.981
Not gonna happen.

53:16.814 --> 53:18.986
Oh, what is this?

53:18.986 --> 53:20.818
(GASPS) Ooh!

53:21.869 --> 53:22.740
Oh, my.

53:22.740 --> 53:25.493
Those are mine!
Where did you get those?

53:25.493 --> 53:27.665
From your room.
Is that cashmere?

53:27.665 --> 53:28.786
I think so.

53:28.786 --> 53:29.827
And there's not
a spot on it.

53:29.827 --> 53:32.460
It would be a shame
if anything happened to it.

53:32.460 --> 53:33.671
Don't you dare.
Mmm!

53:33.671 --> 53:34.752
(GASPS)

53:34.752 --> 53:35.883
What do you got there,
Abigail?

53:35.883 --> 53:39.096
You know, just a few things
that spill on fine garments.

53:39.096 --> 53:40.388
Like

53:41.389 --> 53:42.640
marinara sauce.

53:42.640 --> 53:44.392
Club soda.
Gets it right out.

53:46.894 --> 53:48.476
Soy sauce.

53:48.476 --> 53:49.937
(GASPS)
White vinegar and peroxide.

53:56.854 --> 53:59.567
Oh, well, look
what I have here.

53:59.907 --> 54:00.908
Mmm.

54:01.859 --> 54:03.451
Fruit preserves.
And I think that's... (SNIFFS)

54:03.451 --> 54:05.703
Yeah, that's blueberry.

54:07.034 --> 54:08.786
You wouldn't.

54:28.556 --> 54:31.058
(GASPS) She's not pregnant,
she never was!

54:31.058 --> 54:32.350
Please don't
hurt my sweaters.

54:32.350 --> 54:35.893
Okay, but what about
the pregnancy test?
We saw the lab results.

54:35.893 --> 54:37.395
That was my sister's urine.

54:38.736 --> 54:40.568
Muffy married
an Irish Catholic guy,
so she's always pregnant.

54:41.659 --> 54:43.661
Caitlyn asked me
to get a cup
of her pee, so I did.

54:45.953 --> 54:47.825
Please don't tell her
I blabbed.

54:47.825 --> 54:50.908
We're Gamma Kappa Nus.
Forever.

54:52.870 --> 54:55.543
It's okay, Bitsy. It's over.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.044
Can I go now?
Sure.

54:59.587 --> 55:00.628
(EXCLAIMING)

55:03.090 --> 55:04.512
I can't believe it.

55:04.512 --> 55:09.977
Caitlyn lied about
being pregnant to trick
Tony into marrying her.

55:11.098 --> 55:14.021
That bi...
That...

55:14.021 --> 55:15.933
Say it.
Yeah, it'll make
you feel good.

55:15.933 --> 55:17.935
No, I can't.
I just can't.
That bitch!

(ABIGAIL AND PARKER LAUGH)

55:22.069 --> 55:23.821
Careful, sweetheart.
Don't hurt yourself.

55:23.821 --> 55:24.822
Sorry.

55:25.863 --> 55:27.535
Okay, well, you know what?
This changes everything.

55:27.535 --> 55:28.906
Sure does.
We gotta tell Tony.

55:28.906 --> 55:31.118
Yeah, we have to. When?

55:31.118 --> 55:32.119
(CAITLYN GIGGLING)

55:32.790 --> 55:33.831
Tony, baby.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.163
How about right now?
He's here.

55:37.084 --> 55:39.046
We'll distract Caitlyn,
and you go tell Tony.

55:39.046 --> 55:40.257
Me tell him?
I don't think I can.

55:40.257 --> 55:41.839
After what
she did to you?

55:41.839 --> 55:42.800
After what
she did to us?

55:42.800 --> 55:44.922
Yeah, you're right.
I'll tell him.
I have to.

55:47.805 --> 55:50.558
Okay. Here goes.

55:50.968 --> 55:52.680
I'm taking my life back.

55:53.641 --> 55:54.812
Wish me luck!

55:57.935 --> 55:59.977
Bye, boys! Have fun!

56:00.818 --> 56:03.821
Be careful.
Don't you do anything
I wouldn't do.

56:05.903 --> 56:06.864
Oh!

56:06.864 --> 56:09.036
Isn't that cute?
They're going on a canoe trip.

56:09.286 --> 56:11.829
Male bonding.
Three days out
in the woods.

56:11.829 --> 56:13.991
No laptops,
no cell phones,

56:13.991 --> 56:15.623
no strippers,
thank you very much.

56:15.623 --> 56:16.664
So when are they
gonna be back?

56:16.664 --> 56:19.296
Just right
before the wedding,
which is fine by me.

56:19.296 --> 56:20.998
All he has to do is shave
and put on a tux.

56:20.998 --> 56:23.841
Men are not
very complicated,
are they?

56:40.017 --> 56:43.020
I got it. Why don't we
just find out what river
they are on,

56:43.020 --> 56:45.903
rent a canoe
and some maps and stuff,

56:46.824 --> 56:48.195
and just hunt them down?

56:48.195 --> 56:51.869
Excellent. A plan
that utilizes our vast
wilderness skill set.

56:51.869 --> 56:52.990
Okay, well, what do you got?

56:52.990 --> 56:55.703
A headache.
And I'm hungry, too.

56:55.703 --> 56:56.874
BLUTMAN: Careful now.

56:56.874 --> 56:58.996
Is that Caitlyn's dress?
BLUTMAN: Oh. Okay.
Got it there?

56:58.996 --> 57:00.037
Oh, I was at the fitting.

57:00.037 --> 57:02.590
It is an absolutely
beautiful gown.

57:03.090 --> 57:04.882
Do you realize what
we're trying to do here?

57:05.633 --> 57:06.594
You're right.
I was just...

57:06.594 --> 57:08.716
You're Southern, sweetie.
It's not your fault.

57:08.716 --> 57:10.097
ABIGAIL: We have to
figure out a way to bring

57:10.097 --> 57:10.928
this entire wedding
to its knees.

57:10.928 --> 57:13.721
And when we do,
it is not going to be pretty.

57:13.931 --> 57:15.683
Okay, well, we might
need an actual plan.

it's all wrong!

Caitlyn, honey,
what's all wrong?
What's the matter?

57:39.877 --> 57:41.749
Calm down.
Oh, I will not!

57:41.749 --> 57:42.920
Those idiots,
they ruined it!

57:42.920 --> 57:44.962
Look, look at it! See?
What? What am I
looking at?

57:44.962 --> 57:46.964
Oh, God!
My mother is blind!

57:46.964 --> 57:49.637
Look, blind Mother.
It's Summer Pearl.

57:49.637 --> 57:52.720
And what did I order?
What color did I specify?

57:54.011 --> 57:55.142
Burnished Eggshell!

57:56.353 --> 57:58.856
It's true. I was there.
Burnished Eggshell.
It was lovely.

57:58.856 --> 58:00.307
Are you kidding me?

58:00.858 --> 58:02.980
It's ruined,
the wedding is ruined.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.942
Oh, now, honeybelle,
we've got time.

58:05.442 --> 58:08.866
We can fix it.
I'm gonna get on the phone
straightaway to Jean-Louis.

58:08.866 --> 58:11.108
Oh, well, you better.

58:12.029 --> 58:14.371
You promised me.

58:14.872 --> 58:18.455
Every detail of this wedding
has to be exactly right.

58:18.455 --> 58:21.919
I'm only marrying this guy
because of all the money
you went through.

58:22.790 --> 58:24.461
I don't mind
a loveless marriage,

58:24.461 --> 58:29.006
but I will not tolerate
anything less than
a perfect wedding.

58:31.929 --> 58:33.010
If it is not
the wedding I want,

58:33.010 --> 58:35.012
I am not walking down
your aisle. Period.

58:36.053 --> 58:39.807
It'll be perfect, honeybelle.
It'll be perfectly perfect.

58:42.189 --> 58:44.942
Man, it'd sure
be a shame if
anything happened

58:44.942 --> 58:46.984
in the next couple
of days that would
make this wedding

58:46.984 --> 58:48.696
less than perfect.
Mmm-hmm.

58:48.696 --> 58:51.238
Ooh, I just
got chills.

58:58.576 --> 59:01.619
Yes, is this the
florist in charge of
the McNabb wedding?

59:02.419 --> 59:04.752
Who am I?
Caitlyn.
You can do Caitlyn.

59:05.753 --> 59:09.126
Well, this is
Miss Caitlyn McNabb,
bride-to-be.

59:09.126 --> 59:10.758
I would like to make
a few changes to my
floral arrangements...

59:11.799 --> 59:13.801
I would never
order lilies.

59:13.801 --> 59:16.263
Ever since I was
six years old...

59:16.263 --> 59:18.726
Do you know what
they do to her?
Her eyes water.

59:18.726 --> 59:20.728
And I get these
awful hives
all over my body.

59:20.728 --> 59:24.231
Mother, I need my ointment!

59:25.272 --> 59:27.605
Mother and I think
a white tent
is just so blah,

59:27.605 --> 59:29.186
so I was wondering
if you had anything
