00:16.047 --> 00:17.949
No!

01:18.077 --> 01:19.777
<i>Hayes Morrison's
rant about privilege</i>

01:19.812 --> 01:21.479
<i>could not have been more fun to watch,</i>

01:21.513 --> 01:23.821
<i>for everyone except her mother,
Harper Morrison.</i>

01:23.846 --> 01:27.051
<i>I screw up. Because of my last
name, the cops call the D.A.</i>

01:27.086 --> 01:28.453
<i>He calls my mom.</i>

01:28.487 --> 01:29.540
<i>Strings are pulled.</i>

01:29.565 --> 01:32.600
<i>I'm out on the street in an hour
with a new job.</i>

01:32.625 --> 01:34.626
<i>Harper's poll numbers have taken a hit</i>

01:34.660 --> 01:36.394
<i>since Hayes revealed
her mother helped her</i>

01:36.428 --> 01:38.463
<i>escape punishment for cocaine possession</i>

01:38.497 --> 01:41.165
<i>with the assistance
of District Attorney Conner Wallace.</i>

01:41.200 --> 01:43.901
Hi, Jax. It's me.

01:43.936 --> 01:45.870
Again.

01:45.904 --> 01:48.806
I bet the apartment's
really lonely without me.

01:50.576 --> 01:53.511
I'm sorry about the interview.

01:53.545 --> 01:55.680
Feel free to call and yell at me.

01:55.714 --> 01:59.050
Just call me back.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.352
Please.

02:12.431 --> 02:14.899
Give me your poor, your tired,

02:14.933 --> 02:17.602
your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free.

02:17.636 --> 02:19.663
How come your suitcases
and toiletries bag

02:19.688 --> 02:21.132
- are in your office?
- No reason.

02:21.157 --> 02:23.841
Our next case,
I want a worldclass underdog.

02:23.876 --> 02:26.073
Disadvantaged, deprived,
hapless in every way.

02:26.098 --> 02:27.612
Her brother kicked her out
after the interview,

02:27.646 --> 02:29.664
and moving into the
Four Seasons wouldn't

02:29.689 --> 02:31.683
be self-punishing enough.
How am I doing?

02:31.717 --> 02:33.918
A David who got kicked
in the ass by Goliath.

02:33.952 --> 02:34.952
Someone? Anyone?

02:34.987 --> 02:36.521
Jacob Atkins.

02:36.555 --> 02:37.755
In prison for murder.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.924
Atkins was on LSD
during the interrogation.

02:39.958 --> 02:41.592
The cops convinced him he was guilty.

02:41.627 --> 02:43.224
Public or private defense attorney?

02:43.249 --> 02:44.696
- Private.
- Not poor enough. Next.

02:44.730 --> 02:45.797
Nicole Sanders.

02:45.831 --> 02:47.906
Convicted of violating the Clean Air Act

02:47.931 --> 02:49.634
- when her asbestos-removal firm...
- Clean Air Act...

02:49.668 --> 02:53.004
a hot-button topic for
America's underclass. Next.

02:53.038 --> 02:54.806
I'm sorry, are we
supposed to pick a case

02:54.840 --> 02:56.808
that soothes your privileged guilt?

02:56.842 --> 02:57.942
There are worse things.

02:57.976 --> 02:59.777
Glad you could make it, Frankie.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.212
Sorry I'm late.

03:01.246 --> 03:02.447
Case you want to pitch?

03:02.481 --> 03:03.614
No.

03:03.649 --> 03:05.793
- No, I'm good.
- Will Jarrett.

03:05.818 --> 03:07.785
Passed around by six
court-appointed attorneys

03:07.820 --> 03:09.921
before being sentenced
to 40 years for murder.

03:09.955 --> 03:11.756
Six court-appointed lawyers?

03:11.790 --> 03:14.225
I can smell the deprivation from here.

03:14.259 --> 03:15.493
Who's Will accused of offing?

03:15.527 --> 03:16.627
Debra Porter.

03:16.662 --> 03:18.763
Wealthy wife and mom
of a friend of Will's.

03:18.797 --> 03:20.665
Stabbed to death in her mansion
in Forest Hills Estates.

03:20.699 --> 03:22.600
The haves versus the have-nots.

03:22.634 --> 03:23.901
Perfect.

03:33.756 --> 03:36.114
Debra Porter, wife of
David Porter, mother of Sean,

03:36.148 --> 03:38.082
head of her neighborhood association,

03:38.117 --> 03:39.851
and active in numerous charities.

03:39.885 --> 03:42.253
According to the neighbors,
they were the perfect family.

03:42.287 --> 03:46.090
And the lies start right away.
Perfect family, perfect B.S.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.125
I remember this case.

03:47.159 --> 03:50.295
Every detective in Queens worked double
shifts until that kid was caught.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.997
Nothing frees up overtime money
like a rich, white family

03:53.031 --> 03:54.999
and their manicured lawn
being under attack.

03:55.033 --> 03:58.202
October 7, 2007... Debra's son
was away at boarding school.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.938
David Porter came home from his
hedge-fund job to find this...

04:00.973 --> 04:03.841
Debra had been stabbed
seven times, throat slashed.

04:03.876 --> 04:04.976
It's so brutal.

04:05.010 --> 04:07.011
What's the connection between
the poor kid and the rich family again?

04:07.045 --> 04:09.280
Will met the Porters through
one of Debra's charities,

04:09.314 --> 04:11.182
an organization for disadvantaged youth.

04:11.216 --> 04:12.784
The prosecution must
have had a field day.

04:12.818 --> 04:13.851
How did they spin in?

04:13.886 --> 04:16.600
Wealthy suburban family
opens door to Oliver Twist,

04:16.625 --> 04:18.810
- only to be repaid by murder?
- Pretty much.

04:18.836 --> 04:19.857
The murder weapon was never found,

04:19.892 --> 04:21.659
but it was believed to have been
a serrated steak knife

04:21.692 --> 04:23.694
missing from the Porters' kitchen.

04:23.729 --> 04:24.896
When Will was questioned by the police

04:24.930 --> 04:26.697
if he was at the Porters' house
on the day of the murder,

04:26.732 --> 04:28.699
he said no, which proved to be a lie.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.701
His skin cells were found

04:30.736 --> 04:32.036
underneath Debra's fingernails.

04:32.070 --> 04:34.305
Lying to the cops... generally
not a sign of innocence.

04:34.339 --> 04:35.873
Or of not trusting the police...

04:35.908 --> 04:38.910
pretty much a default state
when you're not white, wealthy, or both.

04:38.944 --> 04:41.546
None of which changes Will's DNA
tying him to the crime.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.881
Let's go see if the "Blind Side"
has an explanation.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.249
Notify the Porter family.

04:45.284 --> 04:46.884
Read up on the case,
review the evidence,

04:46.919 --> 04:49.187
and see if Will got
the short end of the stick.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.727
Of course
I didn't kill Mrs. Porter.

04:56.762 --> 04:58.996
The Porters were the closest
thing to family I ever had...

04:59.031 --> 05:00.031
<i>ever will have.</i>

05:01.767 --> 05:03.734
I never would have done
anything to hurt her.

05:03.769 --> 05:05.870
So, how did your skin get
under her fingernails?

05:07.105 --> 05:09.907
She was changing a light bulb
and tripped,

05:09.942 --> 05:11.075
and I caught her,

05:11.109 --> 05:13.778
but she scratched my neck.

05:13.812 --> 05:15.213
I know.

05:15.247 --> 05:17.682
I wouldn't believe me, either,
but it's the truth.

05:17.716 --> 05:20.685
Unlike when you told the cops
you didn't see Mrs. Porter that day.

05:20.719 --> 05:22.086
I didn't mean to lie.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.789
The cops asked me
when I was last over there,

05:24.823 --> 05:26.691
and I got the days mixed up.

05:27.893 --> 05:31.095
I still can't believe Hayes Morrison
is working on my case.

05:31.129 --> 05:33.965
Maybe there's some hope
for me after all.

05:33.999 --> 05:36.701
If you're innocent, isn't there always?

05:38.136 --> 05:41.239
I'm thinking you and I didn't
grow up in the same place.

05:41.273 --> 05:44.075
For me, there's never been much hope.

05:44.109 --> 05:47.211
But the Porters changed all that.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.947
They were always making up jobs for me

05:49.982 --> 05:51.148
and then overpaying me for them.

05:51.183 --> 05:52.530
They knew I had nothing.

05:52.555 --> 05:54.118
Are you sure
you weren't helping yourself

05:54.152 --> 05:56.287
to more than they were offering?

05:56.321 --> 06:00.391
The cops discovered missing valuables
from the house after the murder.

06:00.425 --> 06:02.827
Maybe Mrs. Porter
caught you stealing, you...

06:02.861 --> 06:03.861
Why would I risk that?

06:03.896 --> 06:06.230
It would just mean I'd have to spend
more time at my aunt's place.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.065
Is that who you were
living with... your aunt?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.634
Officially, yeah.

06:09.668 --> 06:11.969
My dad split before I was two,

06:12.004 --> 06:15.273
and she took me in when
my mom got busted for drugs.

06:15.307 --> 06:18.809
But she had four kids.

06:18.844 --> 06:20.444
And we were in this rat trap

06:20.479 --> 06:23.080
in the Corona projects
just outside of Forest Hills.

06:23.115 --> 06:25.683
So close, yet so far away.

06:25.717 --> 06:28.019
I got used to going to bed hungry.

06:28.053 --> 06:30.288
But over at the Porters,
there was always food,

06:30.322 --> 06:31.088
tons of it.

06:31.123 --> 06:35.426
And... Mrs. Porter was a great cook.

06:35.460 --> 06:38.963
And she made Thanksgiving
and invited me.

06:38.997 --> 06:43.267
And me and Sean and his dad
watched the game,

06:43.302 --> 06:46.203
and we all had dinner together.

06:46.238 --> 06:48.673
Best holiday of my life.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.841
It was like,

06:50.876 --> 06:55.813
for once, I had a family.

06:58.183 --> 07:00.785
Any idea who else might have
killed Mrs. Porter?

07:00.819 --> 07:04.322
All I know is it wasn't me.

07:06.983 --> 07:08.459
Thank you both
for meeting with me.

07:08.493 --> 07:11.228
Anything to accommodate
the District Attorney's Office.

07:11.263 --> 07:13.030
We can never repay you

07:13.065 --> 07:14.832
for putting my wife's killer away.

07:14.866 --> 07:16.801
Actually, the Conviction Integrity Unit

07:16.835 --> 07:19.403
is taking another look
at the case against Will Jarrett.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.793
Why?

07:20.818 --> 07:24.208
The... That animal's in prison,
where he belongs.

07:24.242 --> 07:26.473
I promise you, if the case holds up,
that's where he'll stay.

07:26.498 --> 07:28.559
I don't understand.
Are you... Are you saying that

07:28.584 --> 07:30.014
maybe Will didn't kill my mom?

07:30.048 --> 07:32.149
That's a possible outcome of our review.

07:32.184 --> 07:34.986
Mr. Jarrett may not have
received an adequate defense.

07:35.020 --> 07:38.022
"Mr. Jarrett," as you call him,

07:38.056 --> 07:41.325
conned my entire family
into trusting him.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.927
Sean treated him like a brother,

07:42.961 --> 07:44.528
Debra and I like a son.

07:44.563 --> 07:47.231
Tell me more about Debra.

07:52.537 --> 07:55.239
Well, she was so smart, driven.

07:55.273 --> 07:57.208
Youngest partner at her law firm.

07:57.242 --> 08:01.912
But she gave all that up
after Sean was born.

08:01.947 --> 08:04.348
We were lucky my success
allowed her to stay home

08:04.383 --> 08:06.283
and focus on the family
and her charity work.

08:06.318 --> 08:08.052
And that's how you met Will.

08:08.086 --> 08:08.886
Yes.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.922
Through the Youth Outreach Program
my mom helped run.

08:11.957 --> 08:13.924
- Were you two close?
- We hung out.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.559
I mean, he seemed nice.

08:15.594 --> 08:17.261
I guess I felt bad

08:17.295 --> 08:19.230
that he didn't have
all the things that I did.

08:19.264 --> 08:20.364
We wanted Sean to understand

08:20.399 --> 08:23.434
that not everyone had
the same privileges that he had.

08:23.468 --> 08:26.270
So we opened our home to Will...

08:26.304 --> 08:29.273
fed him, clothed him,
made him part of the family.

08:29.307 --> 08:32.043
And in return...

08:32.077 --> 08:34.745
he destroyed us.

08:37.115 --> 08:38.982
I think you've given me and Sean

08:39.017 --> 08:40.551
more than enough to process.

08:40.585 --> 08:41.785
Of course.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.990
Eight more years?

08:46.024 --> 08:47.324
I'm not gonna make it.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.926
Do the time.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.227
Don't let it do you.

08:50.262 --> 08:52.463
I really thought I had a shot
with my appeal.

08:52.497 --> 08:55.299
I only got one left now.

08:55.333 --> 08:58.135
Maybe your boss can help
on my next appeal?

08:58.170 --> 09:00.504
Hotshot lawyer and the First Daughter?

09:00.539 --> 09:02.840
That's some serious cred.

09:02.874 --> 09:05.309
That's a big favor.

09:05.343 --> 09:08.379
The job's still new.
I feel weird asking.

09:10.549 --> 09:11.982
Wouldn't want you to feel weird.

09:12.017 --> 09:14.118
Come on, Rey, man.

09:16.354 --> 09:17.865
You're right.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.924
You're out.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.026
You got a shot at a new life.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.029
I want you to have it.

09:25.063 --> 09:27.631
No. No, no. I'll...

09:27.666 --> 09:30.234
I'll ask her about the appeal.

09:31.503 --> 09:33.337
All right?

09:37.375 --> 09:39.844
I-I got to go.

09:53.091 --> 09:55.377
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:59.948 --> 10:02.066
That's the case you had earlier.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.367
How come you didn't pitch it?

10:03.401 --> 10:05.536
It's not really a CIU case.

10:05.570 --> 10:08.139
My friend has only one appeal left.

10:08.173 --> 10:10.141
I told him I'd ask Hayes to take a look.

10:10.175 --> 10:12.409
Someone you knew from prison.

10:12.444 --> 10:14.211
My cell mate.

10:14.246 --> 10:17.515
Well, if he's important to you,
definitely ask Hayes.

10:19.265 --> 10:21.950
You requested all files and evidence
on the Debra Porter case?

10:21.975 --> 10:23.220
It's just that one box?

10:23.255 --> 10:25.289
Not exactly.

10:29.636 --> 10:31.673
If you're nervous about showing Hayes,

10:31.698 --> 10:34.165
I could take a look,
see if there's an angle for appeal.

10:36.234 --> 10:37.434
Okay.

10:37.469 --> 10:40.004
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

10:40.038 --> 10:41.505
Just sign here.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.242
Those are all for the Porter case?

10:45.277 --> 10:46.510
Where do you want them?

10:46.545 --> 10:48.579
Um, conference room.

11:03.762 --> 11:05.429
You here to fill me in
on your next case?

11:05.463 --> 11:06.697
Nope.

11:06.731 --> 11:07.698
Then you can go.

11:07.732 --> 11:09.066
I got you something.

11:20.078 --> 11:21.979
A huge bottle of Ibuprofen?

11:22.013 --> 11:23.614
For the agony of me.

11:27.018 --> 11:28.285
Seriously?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.054
I get that you're mad at me,

11:30.088 --> 11:32.763
but how was I supposed to know
that the U.S. Attorney investigation

11:32.791 --> 11:34.592
was gonna happen?

11:34.626 --> 11:36.393
I'm not mad, Hayes.

11:36.428 --> 11:37.428
I'm done.

11:38.670 --> 11:42.399
When you went off the rails during
that interview, I wasn't surprised.

11:42.434 --> 11:47.104
Upset, sick to my stomach,
pissed off... yeah.

11:47.138 --> 11:48.771
But somewhere, deep inside,

11:48.796 --> 11:51.008
I knew there was a chance
you'd blow things up.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.743
That's what you do.

11:52.777 --> 11:54.578
It's who you are.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.005
And I'd be lying if I said
that doesn't turn me on,

11:57.030 --> 11:58.148
but I don't need it in my life.

11:58.183 --> 11:59.919
You blackmailed me into this job.

11:59.944 --> 12:01.544
I'm only here because you forced me.

12:01.569 --> 12:03.515
That was a mistake...

12:04.772 --> 12:06.457
personally.

12:06.491 --> 12:08.292
Professionally, making you Head of CIU,

12:08.326 --> 12:09.360
that was smart.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.663
That part of our relationship...
that'll continue.

12:37.155 --> 12:40.491
Frankie, it's a bloody shoeprint
from the crime scene.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.627
It's a size 9.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.837
Well, Will Jarrett was
a size 11 back then, right?

12:45.862 --> 12:47.119
I read the trial transcripts.

12:47.144 --> 12:50.301
No shoeprint evidence was
introduced by his lawyers.

12:50.335 --> 12:53.072
That's reasonable doubt
you could drive a truck through.

12:53.097 --> 12:56.040
But who left the print, and why wasn't
it a part of Jarrett's defense?

13:02.970 --> 13:04.516
_

13:12.251 --> 13:14.218
Sorry, Ms. Morrison.
Did I wake you?

13:14.253 --> 13:16.888
What gave you that idea?

13:22.201 --> 13:23.501
Hi, Jackson.

13:23.529 --> 13:25.396
It's me again. Again.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.899
Calling like I'm gonna
call you every morning

13:27.933 --> 13:29.593
until you let me apologize,

13:29.618 --> 13:31.402
because I miss you.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.938
This case we're working on...

13:33.972 --> 13:36.908
there's a... a family
at the center of it.

13:36.942 --> 13:41.212
Anyway, give me a call, text.

13:41.246 --> 13:44.115
Use all the repulsive emojis you want.

13:44.149 --> 13:46.017
I deserve it.

13:48.454 --> 13:50.395
How the hell does a boot print
pointing to another killer

13:50.420 --> 13:51.748
not get used at trial?

13:51.773 --> 13:53.958
That's exactly what I've been wondering.

13:55.594 --> 13:57.095
You never heard of Casual Tuesday?

13:57.129 --> 13:59.931
Jeans are casual. This is slumber party.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.467
Later, I thought we could
braid each other's hair,

14:02.501 --> 14:04.202
do a slam book.

14:04.236 --> 14:07.205
You touch my hair, I will kill you.

14:07.239 --> 14:10.274
Someone edify me on the saga
of the mysteriously-missing boot print.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.910
I tracked down the ADA
who prosecuted the case.

14:12.945 --> 14:14.112
They turned it over to the defense

14:14.146 --> 14:16.214
and were totally shocked
they didn't use it.

14:16.248 --> 14:18.950
So, the cops find a bloody
boot print at a crime scene

14:18.984 --> 14:20.451
that doesn't belong to the accused,

14:20.486 --> 14:22.120
and they don't have to tell anyone?

14:22.154 --> 14:23.921
Prosecutors tell the jury

14:23.956 --> 14:25.725
whatever story of the crime they want.

14:25.750 --> 14:26.881
Same as the defense.

14:26.922 --> 14:29.060
The details they include or omit
is up to them.

14:29.094 --> 14:31.462
As long as they gave the defense
access to those details.

14:31.497 --> 14:33.297
Which they did... supplied the defense

14:33.332 --> 14:35.602
with copies of every
lab report and stitch

14:35.627 --> 14:36.901
of evidence. Got the
receipts to prove it.

14:36.935 --> 14:39.003
So why didn't the defense
counsel bring the print?

14:39.037 --> 14:42.440
The ADA handed over
all 24 boxes of case materials

14:42.474 --> 14:44.575
to Will's first
court-appointed attorney.

14:44.610 --> 14:47.311
After Will's case
was reassigned five times,

14:47.346 --> 14:50.613
only 23 boxes made
it to lawyer number 6.

14:50.638 --> 14:51.809
So that missing box

14:51.834 --> 14:53.918
probably had the lab report
with the boot print.

14:53.952 --> 14:56.848
One simple, human mistake,
and Will goes to jail.

14:56.873 --> 14:58.089
What about the boot itself?

14:58.123 --> 14:59.991
I confirmed the crime-lab results.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.494
Boot tread belonged to
a Bruno Costa work boot, size 9.

15:03.529 --> 15:06.097
Retails for around $1,200.

15:06.131 --> 15:08.026
- For a pair of boots?
- That's moronic.

15:08.050 --> 15:10.134
- That's crazy.
- That's my rent.

15:10.169 --> 15:12.170
Any idea where they sell these bad boys?

15:12.204 --> 15:14.472
We checked every high-end
shoe store in the area,

15:14.506 --> 15:16.107
found three that sold the Costa.

15:16.141 --> 15:18.342
Only 73 pairs purchased in that size

15:18.377 --> 15:21.012
the five years prior
to Debra Porter's death.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.014
One of them sold to David Porter,

15:23.048 --> 15:25.383
the victim's husband, in 2009.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.018
In the detectives' notes on the case,

15:27.052 --> 15:29.165
they mentioned David had
consulted a divorce attorney

15:29.190 --> 15:30.649
a couple months before the murder.

15:30.674 --> 15:33.477
Imagine... scratch the perfect marriage,

15:33.502 --> 15:36.027
find festering misery underneath.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.395
I'll go back and talk to David Porter.

15:37.429 --> 15:38.896
I got this.

15:38.931 --> 15:42.533
Destroying the illusion of familial
bliss is a specialty of mine.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.210
I loved my wife.

15:52.244 --> 15:55.146
I consulted a divorce attorney
because we'd hit a rough patch.

15:55.180 --> 15:57.014
We decided to try counseling together.

15:57.049 --> 15:59.083
What'd you two fight over?

15:59.117 --> 16:02.220
Lots of things, but mainly Sean.

16:02.254 --> 16:05.489
She spearheaded sending him
off to boarding school,

16:05.524 --> 16:06.657
thought he could use the discipline.

16:06.692 --> 16:09.927
I learned a ton at boarding school...

16:09.962 --> 16:14.165
ritual hazing, keg stands,
advanced hydroponics.

16:14.199 --> 16:15.666
Discipline, not so much.

16:15.701 --> 16:17.001
How about Sean?

16:17.035 --> 16:18.936
It helped.

16:18.971 --> 16:22.106
Though probably not enough
for Debra's liking.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.608
Must have been hard on him,

16:23.642 --> 16:27.245
having two such highly
accomplished and driven parents

16:27.279 --> 16:28.946
as you and Debra.

16:28.981 --> 16:31.115
Well, I bet you know
a thing or two about that.

16:31.149 --> 16:32.617
There are pluses and minuses.

16:32.651 --> 16:35.953
Debra did lean on Sean pretty hard...

16:35.988 --> 16:38.256
but it was completely out of love.

16:39.358 --> 16:42.059
Maybe you felt like
you needed to protect Sean.

16:47.165 --> 16:49.300
Are you insinuating
that I killed my wife?

16:49.334 --> 16:51.135
He's insinuating. I'm asking.

16:51.169 --> 16:52.236
Did you kill her?

16:52.271 --> 16:53.704
No.

16:53.739 --> 16:55.706
And I couldn't have.

16:55.741 --> 16:57.441
I was with 10 other people
at the office.

16:57.476 --> 16:58.643
The police confirmed that.

16:58.677 --> 17:01.045
Mr. Porter, do you recognize these?

17:04.148 --> 17:05.549
Yeah.

17:05.584 --> 17:08.118
I... bought a similar pair
seven or eight years ago.

17:08.153 --> 17:11.589
Yeah, we found a matching
boot print in your wife's blood.

17:11.623 --> 17:13.758
Puts you at the scene of the murder.

17:13.791 --> 17:16.627
It wasn't me.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.561
I'd already given
those boots away by then.

17:18.597 --> 17:20.998
Do you remember who you gave them to?

17:21.032 --> 17:22.266
Of course.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.101
Our gardener... Luis.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.005
Luis Torres.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.273
We're from
the Conviction Integrity Unit.

17:29.308 --> 17:31.342
We just want to ask you a few
questions about Debra Porter.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.144
What about her?

17:33.178 --> 17:35.446
Were you working at the Porters'
the day that she was murdered?

17:35.480 --> 17:38.516
That... That was a long time ago.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.618
I would think it's a day
you wouldn't easily forget.

17:40.652 --> 17:43.187
Look, um...

17:43.221 --> 17:44.412
I don't want to get in any trouble.

17:44.437 --> 17:45.654
No one said anything about trouble.

17:45.679 --> 17:47.358
Those are some nice boots, man.

17:47.392 --> 17:49.260
Bruno Costa, size 9, right?

17:49.467 --> 17:50.534
You had 'em a long time?

17:50.559 --> 17:51.996
A few years.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.350
I think you need to come with us.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.072
Well, that doesn't look
too guilty, now, does it?

18:07.637 --> 18:09.465
_

18:12.390 --> 18:15.158
Hi, Jackson. Hayes Morrison.

18:15.192 --> 18:17.660
Yesterday, I left a message saying

18:17.695 --> 18:19.662
that I would be calling you
every morning

18:19.697 --> 18:20.964
until you let me apologize.

18:20.998 --> 18:23.800
Well, this is that call.

18:23.834 --> 18:27.637
I really, really, really am sorry.

18:27.671 --> 18:28.838
I miss you.

18:28.873 --> 18:30.540
I love you.

18:30.574 --> 18:31.808
Call?

18:31.842 --> 18:33.977
Let me grovel.

18:34.011 --> 18:36.946
You know you want to.

18:41.252 --> 18:43.953
I didn't kill Mrs. Debra.

18:43.988 --> 18:45.187
I tried to help her.

18:45.212 --> 18:48.191
You just left a bloody boot print
while you gave her CPR?

18:48.225 --> 18:49.187
I saw her.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.860
I-I bent down to check her pulse.

18:50.895 --> 18:52.290
She was already dead.

18:52.315 --> 18:54.440
So you just walked right back out,

18:54.474 --> 18:57.467
went about your day like you hadn't just
found your boss stabbed to death?

18:57.501 --> 18:59.302
I know I should have called the police,

18:59.337 --> 19:02.472
but I was afraid if they
knew I'd been in the house,

19:02.506 --> 19:04.741
they'd... well, they'd look at me

19:04.775 --> 19:07.277
like the way you two are right now.

19:07.311 --> 19:08.812
I didn't kill her.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.480
No, you were just inside

19:10.514 --> 19:12.549
the day that Debra Porter
was brutally murdered.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.617
I was in the house more than once.

19:14.652 --> 19:15.820
And why's that?

19:15.845 --> 19:17.520
Don't gardeners usually work outside?

19:19.256 --> 19:22.559
They would leave money just
lying around on the counter.

19:22.593 --> 19:26.262
Or in their clothes pockets.

19:26.297 --> 19:27.731
More money than I'd make in a week.

19:27.765 --> 19:29.165
You stole from them.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.600
What else did you take?

19:30.634 --> 19:32.502
The police listed
a number of items missing.

19:32.536 --> 19:34.738
They never missed any of it.

19:34.772 --> 19:37.741
They never even noticed
anything was gone.

19:37.775 --> 19:39.776
Her husband gave you
his $1,000 work boots.

19:39.810 --> 19:42.245
Is that what he told you?

19:43.514 --> 19:45.915
I saw them in the trash.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.817
I asked if I could have them.

19:47.852 --> 19:49.574
That must have made you so angry,

19:49.599 --> 19:51.092
seeing the Porters toss money around

19:51.117 --> 19:53.256
while you had to work so hard
just to get by.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.191
Maybe you got so angry,
you killed Debra Porter.

19:55.226 --> 19:56.659
I didn't do it.

19:56.694 --> 19:59.662
But that... that Jarrett kid
the police arrested...

19:59.697 --> 20:00.797
He's your killer.

20:00.831 --> 20:01.865
I can prove it.

20:01.899 --> 20:03.500
I thought you told the cops
that you didn't see

20:03.534 --> 20:04.768
anyone else around the house that day.

20:04.802 --> 20:06.336
It wasn't that day.

20:06.370 --> 20:07.604
He did this to me.

20:07.638 --> 20:08.505
Will Jarrett?

20:08.539 --> 20:10.507
He came at me for no reason.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.709
Broke my arm in three places.

20:12.743 --> 20:14.477
Why didn't you tell anyone?

20:14.512 --> 20:17.213
He said
he would kill me if I did.

20:20.384 --> 20:24.287
<i>Luis said I threatened him?</i>

20:24.321 --> 20:25.288
That's a lie.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.223
So, what actually happened?

20:27.258 --> 20:28.992
I was working in the Porters' backyard,

20:29.026 --> 20:30.627
painting the guesthouse.

20:30.661 --> 20:32.796
I saw Luis sneaking out
of the main house.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.138
I confronted him,

20:34.163 --> 20:35.665
said I was gonna tell the Porters.

20:35.699 --> 20:38.368
He got angry and came at me.

20:38.402 --> 20:39.702
He said you broke his arm.

20:39.737 --> 20:42.472
I was defending myself, and he fell.

20:42.506 --> 20:44.808
Why didn't you tell anyone about this?

20:44.842 --> 20:47.544
Luis begged me not to.

20:47.578 --> 20:51.214
Said if he got fired by the Porters,
he'd lose all his other clients.

20:52.683 --> 20:54.684
I actually felt bad for the guy.
You believe that?

20:54.718 --> 20:56.419
So you never threatened to kill him?

20:56.454 --> 20:58.388
If I had,

20:58.422 --> 21:01.958
why didn't he tell the police
when he was questioned about the murder?

21:04.261 --> 21:06.630
I'm not a killer.

21:07.731 --> 21:08.998
Hey.

21:09.181 --> 21:10.047
Hey.

21:10.072 --> 21:12.502
So, I looked into your friend's file.

21:12.536 --> 21:15.351
<i>Definitely echoes
of U.S. vs. Rivera Rodriguez.</i>

21:15.376 --> 21:17.340
An appeals court overturned a conviction

21:17.374 --> 21:18.441
for a judicial bias.

21:18.476 --> 21:20.043
The judge improperly intervened

21:20.077 --> 21:22.278
during testimony and closing arguments,

21:22.313 --> 21:23.780
bolstering the prosecution's case.

21:23.814 --> 21:25.715
So you think he's got a shot on appeal.

21:27.051 --> 21:28.952
No, actually.

21:28.986 --> 21:31.254
The judge might have overstepped,

21:31.288 --> 21:33.923
but a security video shows
Rey beating up a store clerk

21:33.958 --> 21:35.859
during the commission of a robbery.

21:35.893 --> 21:37.760
He's not a good guy.

21:37.795 --> 21:39.395
Yeah, you don't know him.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.464
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

21:41.499 --> 21:43.466
You know, me and Rey, we got history.

21:43.501 --> 21:46.469
Okay, that doesn't just stop
because I got out.

21:46.504 --> 21:48.624
- Frankie...
- Thanks for taking a look, though.

21:49.974 --> 21:51.040
I don't know who to believe.

21:51.075 --> 21:53.361
Either Will threatened Luis,
or Luis threatened Will.

21:53.386 --> 21:55.609
- One of them is lying.
- But which one... Will or Luis?

21:55.634 --> 21:57.007
I think I might
have your answer.

21:57.032 --> 21:59.937
You'll never guess what we uncovered
in our search of the gardener's truck.

21:59.962 --> 22:01.110
Try me.

22:01.135 --> 22:03.453
Steak knife... serrated blade.

22:03.487 --> 22:05.088
Matches the one that went
missing in the Porter kitchen.

22:05.122 --> 22:06.489
You just found our murder weapon.

22:06.524 --> 22:08.424
And our murderer.

22:14.528 --> 22:16.435
_

22:16.592 --> 22:17.793
You know the drill.

22:17.827 --> 22:19.669
I leave a message expressing my regret,

22:19.694 --> 22:21.630
which is sincere.

22:21.664 --> 22:24.733
And I tell you I need things
to be right between us.

22:24.767 --> 22:28.224
Which is totally selfish, but true,

22:28.249 --> 22:30.192
because without you...

22:32.036 --> 22:33.375
Listen, you have
every right to feel mad.

22:33.409 --> 22:35.210
I betrayed you.

22:35.244 --> 22:37.679
Like the time when we were kids
and at Thanksgiving,

22:37.714 --> 22:40.382
I lied and told Aunt Kate
that you were the one

22:40.416 --> 22:43.285
that broke the ugly collectible plate
that she loved so much.

22:43.319 --> 22:45.854
You... You said you'd never
speak to me again.

22:45.888 --> 22:48.256
But you did, eventually.

22:50.393 --> 22:53.495
Can we just fast-forward to eventually?

22:53.529 --> 22:56.264
Are we sure that's the knife
that killed Debra Porter?

22:56.299 --> 22:57.666
100%.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.434
Microscopic traces
of Debra Porter's blood

22:59.469 --> 23:01.169
were found on the inside of the handle.

23:01.204 --> 23:02.237
It's the missing steak knife.

23:02.271 --> 23:03.271
So, wait.

23:03.306 --> 23:06.341
The murder weapon is
a "Porter house" steak knife?

23:08.611 --> 23:11.713
Like a Porterhouse steak.

23:13.609 --> 23:16.211
Add to that
Luis' bloody boot print

23:16.236 --> 23:18.953
plus his habit of stealing
from the Porter household.

23:18.978 --> 23:21.690
Maybe Debra caught him in the
house and he killed her.

23:21.724 --> 23:23.759
Well, we have more than enough
probable cause to arrest him.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.427
- I'll get a warrant.
- Not so fast.

23:25.461 --> 23:27.896
Swapping out one underprivileged
defendant for another...

23:27.930 --> 23:30.365
I'm sorry if the truth doesn't play into
your "Eat the Rich" fantasy, but...

23:30.390 --> 23:31.608
It's just too neat.

23:31.768 --> 23:33.869
Luis pops up on our radar as a suspect,

23:33.903 --> 23:36.772
and then a couple of days later,
the murder weapon turns up in his truck?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.306
You think the knife was planted...

23:38.341 --> 23:39.408
maybe by the real killer.

23:39.442 --> 23:40.442
Will's already in prison.

23:40.476 --> 23:42.059
Maybe he's not the real killer.

23:42.084 --> 23:44.446
So, why would someone who
literally got away with murder

23:44.480 --> 23:46.214
hang on to the knife all these years

23:46.249 --> 23:48.550
and then frame a second innocent man?

23:48.584 --> 23:50.101
I don't know yet, but whoever it was

23:50.126 --> 23:51.887
had to know Luis was a suspect.

23:51.921 --> 23:54.029
Yes. Our best and only suspect.

23:54.054 --> 23:55.624
We should have the NYPD pick him up.

23:55.658 --> 23:56.625
If you're wrong,

23:56.650 --> 23:58.260
you know what this arrest
will do to him.

23:58.294 --> 23:59.664
He'll lose all his clients.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.396
He'll never work in Forest Hills again.

24:01.431 --> 24:02.731
Frankie's right.

24:02.765 --> 24:05.467
Luis doesn't have the kind of safety net
some of us have.

24:05.501 --> 24:07.169
Even if he's innocent, he'll be ruined.

24:07.203 --> 24:08.904
But he's our prime suspect.
We can't let him get away.

24:08.938 --> 24:11.606
Well, he could be held for
24 hours without charging him.

24:11.641 --> 24:12.707
48, tops.

24:12.742 --> 24:16.311
Sam, go be the great lawyer
Maxine always says you are

24:16.345 --> 24:19.815
and get the cops to give us a full
48 hours before they arrest him,

24:19.849 --> 24:23.418
while we look into the
conveniently-appearing knife.

24:23.453 --> 24:26.263
Retrace Luis' steps
since he's become a suspect.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.931
Wallace isn't talking to me.

24:35.965 --> 24:38.800
<i>Jackson really isn't talking to me.</i>

24:38.835 --> 24:43.505
And the case we're on now,
a family lost their mom.

24:43.539 --> 24:47.843
Somehow, all the signs pointed to you.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.978
Desperate times.

24:50.012 --> 24:51.947
I was surprised you picked up the phone.

24:51.981 --> 24:53.715
I was curious.

24:53.749 --> 24:57.185
A phone call from you
is a rare occurrence.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.854
I thought you'd be pissed.

25:00.022 --> 25:02.390
I'm not completely un-pissed.

25:02.425 --> 25:04.359
But you needed to talk.

25:09.565 --> 25:12.534
I'm sorry about what I said.

25:12.568 --> 25:15.637
I know you are.

25:15.671 --> 25:18.406
I didn't mean to hurt you.

25:18.441 --> 25:19.541
Or anyone else.

25:19.575 --> 25:22.410
Just because you didn't mean it...

25:22.445 --> 25:24.646
doesn't lessen the damage done.

25:25.748 --> 25:28.316
How do I make things right
with Wallace and Jackson?

25:28.351 --> 25:31.720
With your brother,

25:31.754 --> 25:34.356
he'll be fine in time.

25:34.390 --> 25:36.758
I mean, as soon as my numbers recover,

25:36.792 --> 25:39.427
it'll be yesterday's news.

25:39.462 --> 25:41.563
As to Wallace...

25:44.600 --> 25:46.735
...go with your weapon of choice.

25:46.769 --> 25:48.236
What's that?

25:48.271 --> 25:49.571
The truth,

25:49.605 --> 25:52.345
which you wield
with a skill and precision

25:52.370 --> 25:55.944
which is breathtaking to watch.

25:55.978 --> 25:58.847
Except with the people closest to you.

25:58.881 --> 26:01.016
Well, I haven't exactly pulled punches

26:01.050 --> 26:02.751
with you and Jackson and Dad...

26:02.785 --> 26:05.520
I'm not talking about your opinions.

26:05.555 --> 26:07.889
I'm talking about your feelings

26:07.924 --> 26:11.393
towards the people who matter to you.

26:11.427 --> 26:14.529
Have you told Wallace
how you feel about him?

26:16.465 --> 26:19.067
He doesn't want anything to do with me.

26:19.101 --> 26:21.403
And you're okay with that?

26:26.409 --> 26:27.976
So tell him.

26:28.010 --> 26:29.911
Tell him why.

26:29.946 --> 26:32.247
See what happens.

26:39.755 --> 26:41.323
I got to go. Work stuff.

26:41.357 --> 26:43.091
Go.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.060
I know my way out.

26:45.094 --> 26:46.394
Feelings will have to wait.

26:47.630 --> 26:50.932
Just... don't let them wait too long.

26:59.775 --> 27:01.509
I went to
all the homes Luis worked at

27:01.544 --> 27:04.512
since he became a target of
our investigation two days ago.

27:04.547 --> 27:06.815
Got security-camera footage
from all of them.

27:06.849 --> 27:08.016
It's a good thing the high-and-mighty

27:08.050 --> 27:09.818
are afraid of the low and impoverished.

27:11.654 --> 27:13.922
He could just be looking
to rip off some tools.

27:15.688 --> 27:16.889
Or not.

27:16.914 --> 27:18.241
The knife was planted.

27:18.266 --> 27:19.361
Luis was set up.

27:19.395 --> 27:20.829
Could we get a better look at this guy?

27:22.665 --> 27:25.133
It's Sean Porter. Do you think he...

27:25.167 --> 27:26.601
Killed his mother?

27:26.636 --> 27:28.003
Sure looks like it.

27:35.164 --> 27:37.069
_

27:40.176 --> 27:41.710
The video speaks for itself.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.646
Really? Because I see a lot
that's open to interpretation.

27:44.681 --> 27:47.482
This isn't an inkblot test, counselor.

27:47.517 --> 27:50.419
We're charging your client with
planting evidence, for starters.

27:50.453 --> 27:51.887
We believe Sean murdered his mother

27:51.921 --> 27:53.088
and let Will Jarrett take the fall.

27:53.122 --> 27:54.656
That's impossible.

27:54.691 --> 27:57.059
Sean was at boarding school,
125 miles away.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.727
That's where he was supposed to be.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.530
Turns out, Sean paid off his proctor
to let him leave school grounds.

28:01.564 --> 28:02.998
He'd done it a lot that semester.

28:03.032 --> 28:05.012
I tried it with the Secret Service.
They never bit.

28:05.037 --> 28:06.168
That doesn't prove anything.

28:06.193 --> 28:08.070
We thought you could help us
flesh that out.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.705
Tell us what really happened,

28:09.739 --> 28:12.184
and you'll be out of Sing Sing
in time for your midlife crisis.

28:12.209 --> 28:15.777
Sean's not going to prison,
because he didn't kill Debra Porter.

28:15.812 --> 28:17.356
He happened to have the murder weapon,

28:17.381 --> 28:19.181
but had nothing to do with the murder?

28:19.215 --> 28:20.749
Where'd you keep it
all these years, Sean?

28:20.783 --> 28:22.117
Not a word, Sean.

28:22.151 --> 28:23.151
This interview is over.

28:23.186 --> 28:24.920
Then we'll have the police
arrest your client.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.121
On trumped-up charges.

28:26.155 --> 28:28.536
Charges that carry a term
of a life sentence without parole.

28:28.561 --> 28:29.746
That's enough.

28:29.771 --> 28:30.959
I have something to say.

28:30.994 --> 28:32.928
- David.
- You're here because I pay you.

28:34.958 --> 28:36.832
We'll give you what you want.

28:38.735 --> 28:39.706
Sean did plant the knife,

28:39.731 --> 28:42.204
but only after Will Jarrett
told him where to find it.

28:42.238 --> 28:44.806
Sick bastard must have
held onto it as memento.

28:44.841 --> 28:49.611
Then he ordered Sean
to plant it in Luis' truck.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.046
Why would Sean go along with that?

28:51.080 --> 28:52.247
Because Will threatened him.

28:52.281 --> 28:53.882
From behind bars?

28:53.916 --> 28:55.617
Will is a psychopath.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.787
He's been manipulating my son
since Day 1,

28:58.821 --> 29:01.223
taking advantage
of his generosity and naivete.

29:01.257 --> 29:05.627
Good news is, you'll have plenty
of time before Sean's trial

29:05.662 --> 29:06.962
to come up with a better story.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.540
And if we find out

29:08.565 --> 29:11.066
that Sean was involved
in your wife's death,

29:11.100 --> 29:12.525
there won't be enough money in the world

29:12.550 --> 29:14.062
to keep him out of an orange jumpsuit.

29:14.087 --> 29:17.174
Well, you've managed to avoid
wearing one, Ms. Morrison.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.776
I think Sean will be just fine.

29:26.683 --> 29:29.585
We have a new suspect
in the Debra Porter murder.

29:29.619 --> 29:31.053
That's great.

29:31.087 --> 29:32.721
Did Luis confess?

29:32.755 --> 29:33.689
Not exactly.

29:33.723 --> 29:35.824
We're looking at Sean Porter.

29:35.858 --> 29:38.860
Sean?

29:38.895 --> 29:40.062
Why?

29:40.096 --> 29:42.598
'Cause he planted the murder
weapon on the gardener.

29:42.632 --> 29:45.067
We think Sean killed his mother,

29:45.101 --> 29:47.769
but he says that's not true.

29:47.804 --> 29:49.171
What does he say?

29:49.205 --> 29:51.907
He says that you told him
where to find the knife

29:51.941 --> 29:54.176
and threatened to hurt him
if he didn't plant it.

29:59.649 --> 30:01.516
Sean really said that?

30:01.551 --> 30:04.620
His dad did, but Sean didn't disagree.

30:04.654 --> 30:06.788
Is it true, Will?

30:06.823 --> 30:08.557
Did you threaten Sean?

30:11.794 --> 30:14.529
Or was he involved in some way?

30:14.564 --> 30:17.933
Did he kill his mother and then
convince you to take the fall?

30:24.907 --> 30:27.209
No.

30:27.243 --> 30:30.579
Sean's telling the truth.

30:30.613 --> 30:32.147
I told him to plant the knife.

30:32.181 --> 30:33.782
Will, think about what you're saying.

30:33.816 --> 30:36.118
I killed Debra Porter.

30:36.152 --> 30:38.553
It was me.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.489
On my own.

30:40.523 --> 30:42.624
I was hoping you could get me out,

30:42.659 --> 30:46.595
but I don't deserve it.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.767
I'm guilty.

30:56.673 --> 30:58.083
Why the sudden 180?

30:58.108 --> 30:59.675
I really thought
he was gonna rat Sean out.

30:59.709 --> 31:01.677
Me, too, and then it was like
he wanted to protect him.

31:01.711 --> 31:02.973
But why? Why would he do that?

31:02.998 --> 31:05.528
Money? Maybe Sean paid him
to kill his mother.

31:05.553 --> 31:07.326
But why stay quiet all this time?

31:09.686 --> 31:11.119
Love.

31:11.154 --> 31:13.904
Did you see his reaction when you
told him Sean had laid him out?

31:13.929 --> 31:16.170
He wasn't angry. He was hurt.

31:16.195 --> 31:17.659
You think they were in a relationship?

31:17.694 --> 31:20.662
Maybe Debra objected
to her son's sexuality.

31:20.697 --> 31:22.764
It didn't square
her perfect family portrait.

31:22.799 --> 31:25.801
So Sean killed her, but Will
took the fall. That's crazy.

31:25.835 --> 31:27.703
It would explain
why Sean planted the knife.

31:27.737 --> 31:29.376
I mean, he wanted
his boyfriend out of jail.

31:29.401 --> 31:32.013
One of them killed her. It's just a
question of figuring out which one.

31:32.041 --> 31:34.476
I might be able to get you an answer.

31:36.179 --> 31:38.013
First officers found
Debra Porter in this room...

31:38.047 --> 31:40.015
throat slashed, stab wounds
to her chest and abdomen.

31:40.049 --> 31:42.017
Tell me how she got here.

31:42.051 --> 31:43.919
It started in the foyer.

31:46.322 --> 31:48.724
Debra had come home from a workout.

31:48.758 --> 31:50.792
Homicide found her compact
on the ground.

31:50.827 --> 31:53.628
She was probably fixing her makeup,
never saw it coming.

31:54.897 --> 31:57.199
The high-velocity spatter
on the painting

31:57.233 --> 31:59.201
came from the cut on her arm.

32:01.070 --> 32:04.873
Scalloping blood trail indicated
that she fled towards the stairwell.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.348
She was going for the phone,
on the credenza.

32:13.382 --> 32:14.850
That's why there was
blood on the handset.

32:14.884 --> 32:16.017
Will followed her.

32:16.052 --> 32:17.626
She tried to defend herself,

32:17.651 --> 32:19.988
which is why Will's skin
was under her fingernails.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.591
And then he stabbed her... seven times.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.594
But all of Debra's wounds
were on the left side of her body.

32:25.628 --> 32:27.229
Doesn't that mean
the killer was righthanded?

32:27.263 --> 32:28.330
Most likely, yeah.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.198
But Will is left-handed.

32:30.233 --> 32:31.933
Sean is the righty.

32:31.968 --> 32:36.238
Okay, so Sean sliced
his mom's arm in the foyer,

32:36.272 --> 32:38.707
then followed her here,
where he killed her.

32:38.741 --> 32:41.497
Then he slit his own mother's throat,
made sure she was dead.

32:41.522 --> 32:44.246
All right, but it doesn't explain
the difference in stab wounds.

32:44.280 --> 32:46.782
I mean, the ones in her stomach
were deep and angry.

32:46.816 --> 32:49.251
The ones in her chest
were shallow, almost reluctant.

32:49.285 --> 32:52.053
I think I might know why.

32:52.088 --> 32:54.756
What if Will attacked her first?

32:54.791 --> 32:57.592
He let her run because he knew
she wasn't gonna get very far.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.761
Debra ran into Sean, her son.

32:59.796 --> 33:02.230
Probably thought she was safe,
but she wasn't.

33:02.265 --> 33:04.399
And maybe he grabbed her, held her.

33:04.433 --> 33:06.101
It would explain
the bruises on her wrist.

33:06.135 --> 33:08.136
And then Will stabbed her from behind.

33:08.171 --> 33:09.137
But he couldn't get the job done,

33:09.172 --> 33:11.206
which is why the chest wounds
were hesitant.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.108
Unlike the stomach,
which were anything but.

33:13.142 --> 33:14.943
Because Sean took over.

33:14.977 --> 33:18.980
And stabbed his mother deeply
and savagely from the front.

33:19.015 --> 33:22.511
And because Will came from behind,
the stab wounds looked like

33:22.536 --> 33:24.394
they'd been inflicted
by the same person...

33:24.419 --> 33:26.655
a single right-handed attacker.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.723
- Which means...
- Debra Porter was killed

33:28.748 --> 33:30.892
by her son and his boyfriend.

33:30.927 --> 33:32.928
They did this together.

33:34.884 --> 33:38.262
The M.E. confirms Frankie's theory
of right- and left-handed killers.

33:38.287 --> 33:40.277
Sean and Will murdered Debra together.

33:40.302 --> 33:41.388
We already have Will in custody.

33:41.412 --> 33:43.024
The only question is, how do we get Sean?

33:43.025 --> 33:45.460
We have him on video
planting the murder weapon.

33:45.494 --> 33:47.963
Both Sean and Will say
that Sean was coerced into that.

33:47.997 --> 33:51.466
And once Sean's father's fleet
of high-priced lawyers are done,

33:51.500 --> 33:53.535
Sean might not even see
the inside of a jail cell.

33:53.569 --> 33:56.838
The problem is, we have no physical
evidence tying Sean to the murder.

33:56.872 --> 33:58.540
Maybe we don't need it.

33:58.574 --> 34:01.509
You think you can get Will to talk?

34:01.544 --> 34:03.345
If I push the right buttons.

34:05.281 --> 34:08.216
I already told you, I killed her.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.717
I did it alone.

34:09.752 --> 34:11.686
The evidence tells us
you had an accomplice.

34:11.721 --> 34:13.388
You can't prove it was Sean.

34:13.422 --> 34:15.322
I can prove you're making a big mistake

34:15.358 --> 34:16.858
trying to protect your boyfriend.

34:18.761 --> 34:21.763
You fell hard for Sean, didn't you?

34:21.797 --> 34:23.331
Who wouldn't?

34:23.366 --> 34:25.433
He's handsome, charming, wealthy.

34:25.467 --> 34:28.870
He was your ticket into a world
you didn't even know existed.

34:28.904 --> 34:31.406
Too bad he didn't
feel the same about you.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.873
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:32.908 --> 34:34.409
I think I do.

34:34.443 --> 34:36.277
I grew up just like Sean.

34:36.312 --> 34:37.746
I learned how to use my privilege

34:37.780 --> 34:39.347
to get what I wanted.

34:39.382 --> 34:40.748
Just like Sean was using you.

34:40.783 --> 34:43.885
I bet he was the one that talked
you into killing his mom, right?

34:43.918 --> 34:45.853
- No, that's...
- He knew you had a terrible childhood,

34:45.888 --> 34:49.244
so he used his wealth
to make you feel special,

34:49.268 --> 34:50.815
and then he manipulated you...

34:50.840 --> 34:52.813
- used you, treated you like hired help,
- No. Stop.

34:52.838 --> 34:54.088
which is all you really were, anyway.

34:54.112 --> 34:55.768
You're wrong. It wasn't like that.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.428
No? What was it like?

34:57.566 --> 34:58.833
We...

35:04.525 --> 35:08.166
We... were... in love.

35:08.644 --> 35:11.002
<i>You were in love.</i>

35:11.447 --> 35:12.947
Sean didn't care about you.

35:12.982 --> 35:15.363
- You were his patsy.
- That's a lie.

35:15.388 --> 35:17.819
He let you rot in prison because
he never really cared about you.

35:17.853 --> 35:20.213
Stop saying that.
I know that he loved me.

35:20.238 --> 35:22.057
- You're delusional.
- That's not true.

35:22.091 --> 35:23.091
Prove it!

35:27.830 --> 35:30.298
<i>- Tell me you love me.
- I do.</i>

35:30.332 --> 35:32.400
<i>You never say it.</i>

35:32.435 --> 35:34.987
<i>I told you I'd say it
when we got rid of our problem.</i>

35:37.573 --> 35:38.740
<i>Can't we just run away?</i>

35:38.765 --> 35:40.753
<i>She'd cut me off financially if we did.</i>

35:40.778 --> 35:43.019
<i>We wouldn't be able to do
all the things we talked about.</i>

35:43.126 --> 35:46.698
<i>All I want... is this.</i>

35:48.300 --> 35:50.435
<i>And we can have this, all the time.</i>

35:50.469 --> 35:51.936
<i>No more hiding.</i>

35:51.971 --> 35:53.772
<i>What about your dad?</i>

35:53.806 --> 35:56.274
<i>He'll come around eventually.</i>

35:56.308 --> 35:57.976
<i>Will you help me?</i>

35:58.010 --> 36:00.445
<i>I can't do it without you.</i>

36:03.816 --> 36:05.430
<i>Yes.</i>

36:09.455 --> 36:10.455
Where'd you get this?

36:10.489 --> 36:12.323
The video was saved on a clone phone

36:12.358 --> 36:13.925
that Will kept hidden in his cell.

36:13.959 --> 36:14.926
He gave it to us.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.628
He had a phone in prison?

36:16.662 --> 36:18.463
Yeah, cellphones are
one of the most-smuggled items

36:18.497 --> 36:19.731
into prisons. I had one.

36:19.765 --> 36:22.000
We pulled the video
from the phone's SD card.

36:22.034 --> 36:23.802
Will had this, Sean had the knife

36:23.836 --> 36:25.637
as a reminder of their connection...

36:25.671 --> 36:28.807
a reminder that Will
would do anything for him.

36:28.841 --> 36:31.743
Because he was in love.

36:47.660 --> 36:48.660
<i>You're never
gonna give up, are you?</i>

36:48.694 --> 36:50.128
No!

36:50.162 --> 36:52.376
We closed another case.
I want to tell someone about it.

36:52.401 --> 36:54.332
<i>Well, I'm... I'm sure
you'll have no problem</i>

36:54.366 --> 36:55.834
<i>finding "someone" to tell about it.</i>

36:55.868 --> 36:56.901
<i>Goodbye, Hayes.</i>

36:56.936 --> 36:58.837
Wait, no, I... I didn't
want to tell "someone."

36:58.871 --> 37:01.005
<i>I want to tell you.
I want to tell my brother.</i>

37:01.040 --> 37:02.674
<i>Please, talk to me.</i>

37:02.708 --> 37:04.109
I'm gonna need more groveling.

37:04.143 --> 37:05.009
<i>Of... Of course.</i>

37:05.044 --> 37:06.377
You're right.

37:06.412 --> 37:08.113
I...I screwed up.

37:08.147 --> 37:10.849
Me. I. Screwed. Up.

37:10.883 --> 37:12.350
How?

37:12.384 --> 37:13.852
I screwed up by thinking

37:13.886 --> 37:15.653
that just because
I was telling the truth,

37:15.688 --> 37:17.489
it didn't matter
who I hurt along the way.

37:17.523 --> 37:19.524
<i>- And?
- ...</i>

37:19.558 --> 37:23.862
I have always accepted
who you are personally,

37:23.896 --> 37:26.364
and I should have done the same
with your career.

37:26.398 --> 37:28.032
That's who you are, too.

37:28.067 --> 37:30.401
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

37:30.436 --> 37:32.871
The other night, I didn't respect that.

37:34.707 --> 37:36.808
Never have, probably.

37:36.842 --> 37:37.742
Nope.

37:37.776 --> 37:41.546
I'm sorry for every time
I didn't tell you

37:41.580 --> 37:46.484
how much I needed you,
admire you, love you,

37:46.519 --> 37:48.019
because I do.

37:48.053 --> 37:49.888
Please forgive me.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.024
<i>So...</i>

37:55.049 --> 37:57.896
Tell me about this big case
that you just cracked.

38:00.232 --> 38:01.599
Dad!

38:01.634 --> 38:04.584
Stop! Get those off my son!

38:13.112 --> 38:15.180
This is Will Jarrett's fault.

38:15.214 --> 38:16.581
He manipulated Sean!

38:16.615 --> 38:18.612
We both know that's not true.

38:29.628 --> 38:31.529
Is that why Debra sent him
to boarding school...

38:31.564 --> 38:32.830
to break up their relationship?

38:35.634 --> 38:37.936
Debra just wanted
what was best for Sean.

38:37.970 --> 38:40.104
As long as he wasn't in love with a man?

38:40.139 --> 38:41.940
No.

38:41.974 --> 38:45.743
Neither of us had a problem
with Sean being gay.

38:45.778 --> 38:47.979
So what was the issue?

38:48.013 --> 38:51.115
Debra didn't approve of Will.

38:51.150 --> 38:55.220
She felt that he wasn't... like us.

38:55.254 --> 38:57.488
Because he was poor?

38:58.857 --> 39:00.091
Was that a deal-breaker for you, too?

39:00.125 --> 39:03.127
No, but Debra was so adamant...

39:03.162 --> 39:06.097
that he just wasn't
good enough for Sean,

39:06.131 --> 39:08.800
that they were
from two different worlds.

39:08.834 --> 39:12.437
Well, now they'll
be sharing the same one.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.428
Thanks for your help, guys.

39:28.621 --> 39:31.089
What part of "I'm done"
did you not understand?

39:31.123 --> 39:32.490
Just giving you an update.

39:32.524 --> 39:34.125
We closed another case.

39:34.159 --> 39:35.760
Could have told me that over the phone.

39:35.794 --> 39:38.997
Any news from the U.S. Attorney
investigation?

39:39.031 --> 39:40.832
I've hired outside counsel.

39:40.866 --> 39:42.967
Great. Anyone I know?

39:43.002 --> 39:45.103
Naomi Golden.

39:45.137 --> 39:46.938
Out of Chicago.

39:48.340 --> 39:50.241
You have a problem with that?

39:51.844 --> 39:53.177
She's my ex-girlfriend.

39:54.116 --> 39:55.983
Mine, too.

39:56.715 --> 39:58.553
She's also a former U.S. Attorney,

39:58.578 --> 40:02.020
not to mention one of the top
criminal litigators in the country.

40:02.054 --> 40:04.289
I'm going to need her expertise.

40:04.323 --> 40:06.844
I'm sure you will.

40:07.893 --> 40:10.194
Legally and otherwise.

40:23.008 --> 40:25.276
I was wondering when you were
finally gonna give me that.

40:27.046 --> 40:30.348
His name's Rey Armas.

40:30.382 --> 40:32.216
We were inside together.

40:32.481 --> 40:34.052
A friend of yours?

40:35.773 --> 40:37.174
Yeah.

40:39.224 --> 40:41.495
Okay, leave it, and I'll take a look.

40:42.471 --> 40:44.487
It's more than that.

40:45.049 --> 40:47.706
Me and Rey, we...

40:51.270 --> 40:52.723
I love him.

40:53.004 --> 40:55.012
Or I did. I don't...

40:58.403 --> 41:00.614
He helped me get through...

41:01.814 --> 41:03.479
being locked up.

41:05.744 --> 41:07.119
So...

41:07.307 --> 41:08.773
I... I'll take a look.

41:11.894 --> 41:13.943
I don't know if he should get out.

41:16.006 --> 41:18.701
I thought that's what I wanted,

41:20.271 --> 41:22.095
but I don't know what's right.

41:23.079 --> 41:26.196
For him, or for you?

41:31.290 --> 41:33.275
I'm not sure.

41:34.861 --> 41:37.314
Well, let me know when you are.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.572
Or not.

41:40.119 --> 41:41.152
It's your call.

41:43.947 --> 41:46.158
Yeah.
