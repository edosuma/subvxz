00:57.167 --> 00:59.433

01:04.733 --> 01:05.900
AND THEY'LL MEET A GIRL
OR SOMETHING.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.300

01:07.333 --> 01:08.500
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO,
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE HAT OFF,

01:08.533 --> 01:09.967

PSYCHOLOGICALLY

01:27.067 --> 01:28.500
PSYCHOLOGICALLY
WRONG WITH THEM,

01:39.467 --> 01:41.767
I'M SURPRISED HITLER DIDN'T

I MEAN, IF I'M GOING
TO BE A SICK MEGALOMANIAC.

01:44.067 --> 01:47.367
TO ROUND UP PEOPLE WHO I HATED,
THEY WOULD BE ON MY LIST.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.867

02:39.767 --> 02:42.900

02:42.933 --> 02:45.600
HE'S ALWAYS WANTED A DOG,
AND WE KEEP PUTTING HIM OFF.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.867
HE WANTS A DOG, WE CAN'T
PUT HIM OFF ANYMORE.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.100
NO FREAKING PUPPY.

02:49.133 --> 02:51.567
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT THE PEEING,

02:51.600 --> 02:52.767
I DON'T WANT
THE CHEWING.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.133
I WANT A GOOD, SMART,
TRAINED DOG.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.367
JEFF'S GOT THAT
GERMAN SHEPHERD.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.300
OH, RIGHT.

THEY'RE LOOKING
TO GET RID--

03:00.067 --> 03:02.067
OH MY GOD, THIS WOULD
BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.333
HOW OLD IS THE DOG ?

03:03.367 --> 03:06.233
HE'S, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE FOUR.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.267
I HAD A GERMAN SHEPHERD
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.167
YEAH, YEAH.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.300
HE KEEPS
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.500
YOU CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS DOG.

03:11.533 --> 03:13.467
IT'S A CORPSE-SNIFFING DOG.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.800
THEY GOT IT FROM
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

03:14.833 --> 03:15.767
A WHAT ?

03:15.800 --> 03:16.933
IT'S A CORPSE-SNIFFING ?

03:16.967 --> 03:18.733
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS AN AMAZING DOG.

03:18.767 --> 03:19.667
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.667
OSCAR.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.633
OSCAR.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.333
OSCAR.

03:23.367 --> 03:26.100
WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
THEY SEPARATED, AND, UH...

03:26.133 --> 03:28.467
JEFF AND HIS WIFE.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.700
SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
IN THE HOUSE

03:30.733 --> 03:34.467
AND WAS WORRIED, SO SHE GOT
A DOG FOR SECURITY, AND...

03:34.500 --> 03:35.500
AND SHE GOT A SHEPHERD.

03:35.533 --> 03:37.067
RIGHT, AND NOW...

03:37.067 --> 03:39.067
WELL, NOW THEY RECONCILED
AND HE'S MOVED BACK,

03:39.100 --> 03:40.633
BUT HE'S ALLERGIC
TO THE DOG,

03:40.667 --> 03:42.633
AND HE'S SNIFFING
AND SNEEZING ALL THE TIME,

03:42.667 --> 03:43.867
AND HE'S A WRECK.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.967
BUT THE DOG
IS SO GREAT.

03:47.067 --> 03:50.233
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE HAVING
A PERSON THERE WHO BARKS.

03:50.267 --> 03:51.567
HE UNDERSTANDS
EVERYTHING.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.633
HOW'S THE DOG
WITH KIDS ?

03:52.667 --> 03:54.167
GREAT, THEY HAVE
A LITTLE GIRL.

03:54.200 --> 03:58.400
BUT THE DOG IS
FABULOUS WITH HER.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.167
WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.633
SOUNDS PERFECT.

04:01.667 --> 04:03.500
YOU KNOW WHAT,
HOW DO WE DO THIS,
HOW DO WE DO THIS ?

04:03.533 --> 04:05.367
ALRIGHT, SO,
YOU'RE INTERESTED ?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.367
ABSOLUTELY.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.167
YES, YES, VERY.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.833
THAT COULD BE
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

04:09.867 --> 04:12.167
IT'S JUST LIKE AN ELEPHANT
STICKING HIS HEAD IN A POND.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.267
WHAT ARE YOU
WATCHING ?

04:15.300 --> 04:17.967
THIS ROUTINE.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.067
STOP IT.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.733
MM-MM.

04:21.767 --> 04:25.067
NO, I'M SORRY, NO.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.067
THE CORK IS DRY.

04:26.067 --> 04:27.167
WE NEED TO SEND
THIS BACK.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.067
WHAT ?
DON'T SEND THIS BACK.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.967
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO TASTE IT.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.133
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST GO TELL THE MANAGER.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.967
HAVE HIM TASTE IT,
AN ACTUAL BORDEAUX GLASS.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.600
CAN YOU PLEASE
POUR SOME FOR ME ?

04:36.633 --> 04:38.067
YOU CAN'T SEND
THIS BACK.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.833
YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN WINE,
GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD, TASTE IT.

04:39.867 --> 04:41.700
LARRY, COME ON.

04:43.067 --> 04:44.300
FINE.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.633
IT'S FINE,
IT'S DELICIOUS.

04:45.667 --> 04:48.133
AT $140 A BOTTLE,
I DON'T WANT FINE.

04:48.167 --> 04:50.067
LARRY COULDN'T POSSIBLY
TELL THAT THESE...

04:50.067 --> 04:52.167
NO, LARRY, LARRY,
COME ON, YOU CAN'T.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.300
SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH
TO KNOW...

04:54.333 --> 04:56.100
( Stu Braudy )
IT'S NOT A MATTER
OF SOPHISTICATION,

04:56.133 --> 04:57.467
IT'S A DELICATE THING.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.933
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DRINK IT.

04:58.967 --> 04:59.867
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DRINK IT.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.933
WE'LL ORDER
SOMETHING ELSE.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.100
I'LL GET YOU
A NICE SPRITZER.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.067
A SPRITZER.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.100
THAT'S GREAT.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.300
DIDN'T I SAY LAST TIME
WE WERE HERE

05:08.333 --> 05:11.500
I WASN'T GONNA
HAVE DESSERT ?

05:11.533 --> 05:13.733
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR RESTAURANT ?

05:13.767 --> 05:14.733
YOU HAVEN'T
SAID A WORD.

05:14.767 --> 05:15.933
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.533
I'M NOT REALLY ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.500
SHE DOESN'T
REALLY LIKE IT,

05:18.533 --> 05:22.833
SHE'S BORED WITH
RESTAURANT TALK.

05:22.867 --> 05:23.733
NO, YOU TELL IT.

05:23.767 --> 05:24.933
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
ON "SEINFELD"

05:24.967 --> 05:26.500
I WASN'T ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT "SEINFELD".

05:26.533 --> 05:29.867
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT
ANYTHING I'M DOING, YOU KNOW.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.167
I BORE HER,
SHE BORES SO EASILY.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.500
WE'RE OPENING
NEXT WEEK.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.133
THIS NEW CHEF WE GOT,
HE'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.567
GREAT, WHERE
DID YOU FIND HIM ?

05:38.600 --> 05:41.633
OKAY, LARRY ONLY LIKES HIM
BECAUSE HE'S BALD.

05:41.667 --> 05:45.333
NO, THAT'S
TRUE BECAUSE...

05:45.367 --> 05:46.967
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY
THAT, CHERYL, WHY ?

05:47.067 --> 05:49.300
BECAUSE HE TOLD ME, HE GOES,
I FOUND THIS GUY, HE'S GREAT.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.300
HE'S BALD.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.867
DON'T SAY THAT,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.967
IS THAT ?

05:54.067 --> 05:56.467
OH, YEAH, I HIRED,
YEAH, I DID HIRE A BALD MAN.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.633
AND ONLY
BECAUSE HE'S BALD.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.733
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

06:01.767 --> 06:04.233
NO, NO, NO,
NO SPLITTING.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.067
NO SPLITTING.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.733
YOU PICKED UP
THE LAST ONE.

06:07.767 --> 06:08.700
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM ?

06:08.733 --> 06:09.867
HUH ?

06:09.900 --> 06:11.600
YEAH, I GOT TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM, RIGHT.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.767
GO TO THE BATHROOM,
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.467
THANK YOU, STU.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.100
ANYWAY, THANKS STU, THAT'S VERY
NICE OF YOU, THANK YOU.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.667

06:20.700 --> 06:23.400
WHAT ABOUT ME,
YOU GONNA THANK ME TOO ?

06:23.433 --> 06:25.100
AND THANK YOU, SUSAN.

06:25.133 --> 06:26.167
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.233
WHY DO I HAVE
TO THANK YOU ?

06:33.267 --> 06:35.567
FOR DINNER.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.300
THAT MY HUSBAND
AND I TREATED YOU TO.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.333
OH, I THOUGHT
HE TREATED ME TO IT.

06:40.367 --> 06:45.533
STU PULLED OUT THE CREDIT CARD
AND PUT IT DOWN, YES.

06:45.567 --> 06:46.767
YEAH.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.567
SO, I THANKED HIM.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.967
AND HE'S USING OUR MONEY
TO PAY FOR IT.

06:52.067 --> 06:54.767
SO, YOU COULD THANK US,
WE'RE TAKING YOU OUT TO DINNER.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.933
WELL, YOU CAN
CALL IT OUR MONEY,

06:56.967 --> 06:58.333
BUT JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF DISCUSSION,

06:58.367 --> 07:01.067
HE'S THE ONE WHO GOES TO WORK
AND THEN EARNS THE MONEY.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.067
YOU DON'T WORK.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.067
ALRIGHT, WHAT ABOUT,
CHERYL ?

07:04.100 --> 07:07.133
YOU DON'T
WORK YOURSELF.

07:07.167 --> 07:09.233
WHOSE MONEY IS IT
IN YOUR HOUSE ?

07:09.267 --> 07:11.900
HONEY, IT'S OUR MONEY.

07:11.933 --> 07:13.233
NO, IT'S NOT.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.467
I'VE EARNED
THE MONEY.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.233
OH, SO, WHAT DO YOU DO,
YOU PAY HER A SALARY ?

07:16.267 --> 07:17.467
HOW DOES
SHE BUY THINGS ?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.467
SHE SPENDS THE MONEY
THAT I'VE EARNED.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.467
SHE DIDN'T WORK,
I EARNED THE MONEY.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.633
LOVING YOU
IS MY JOB, LARRY.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.300
I EARNED THE MONEY,
IT'S JUST A FACT.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.167
STU, IS IT OUR,
IT'S OUR MONEY.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.633
OUR MONEY.

07:30.667 --> 07:31.500
I, YOU KNOW,
AND, UH...

07:31.533 --> 07:32.433
RIGHT ?

07:32.467 --> 07:33.500
HE WORKS,
HE GETS THE MONEY.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.100
AND IT BECOMES...

07:35.133 --> 07:37.533
IT'S NOT THEIR MONEY,
IT'S MY MONEY.

07:37.567 --> 07:39.333
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHERE
IT'S COMING FROM,
IT'S WHAT IT BECOMES.

07:39.367 --> 07:42.567
NO, IT'S COMPLETELY ABOUT
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.467
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT,
WHERE DOES IT COME FROM ?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.767
WELL, I MUST SAY
THAT I AM JUST GLAD THAT,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.900
IN MY MARRIAGE,
THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE.

07:48.933 --> 07:51.233
THAT STU CONSIDERS IT...

07:51.267 --> 07:54.867
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE
IN OUR MARRIAGE EITHER.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.700
IT'S JUST A FACT OF
WHERE THE MONEY CAME FROM.

07:56.733 --> 07:59.567
HAVIN' A GREAT,
I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.700
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

08:01.733 --> 08:03.200
THIS IS NICE.

08:09.300 --> 08:13.500
HEY, YOU KNOW ME,
I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN.

08:13.533 --> 08:14.900
OH, YEAH, YES, YES.

08:14.933 --> 08:17.433
I THINK YOU KNOW ME
WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT BY NOW.

08:17.467 --> 08:18.667
WHAT ?

08:18.700 --> 08:20.767
HOW COME THERE'S NO PARTITIONS
IN THE BATHROOM,

08:20.800 --> 08:21.767
BETWEEN THE URINALS ?

08:21.800 --> 08:25.100
HERE ?
YEAH.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.467
I DON'T KNOW.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.767
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA HAVE THAT.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.367
DO WE HAVE,
IS IT IMPORTANT ?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.067
I MEAN,
IT LOOKS NICE NOW.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.867
WE WANT A LITTLE PEE PRIVACY,
DO WE NOT ?

08:33.900 --> 08:35.067
I'M ABSOLUTELY
WITH YOU.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.800
YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE
LOOKING DOWN AT YOUR THING.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.400
THIS ISN'T A BUS STATION,
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

08:39.433 --> 08:40.767
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE THAT
KIND OF CROWD, BUT...

08:40.800 --> 08:42.533
THIS IS A HIGH CLASS
RESTAURANT, LARRY ?

08:42.567 --> 08:44.667
STILL PEOPLE GO OFF
TO THE SIDE.

08:44.700 --> 08:48.600
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT
THE 45 DEGREE ANGLE THINGS.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.333
BUT IS IT REALLY
IMPORTANT, LARRY ?

08:50.367 --> 08:52.533
YES, MICHAEL,
IT IS IMPORTANT, YES.

08:52.567 --> 08:53.700
HUH ?

08:53.733 --> 08:55.433
ALRIGHT, SO WE'LL HAVE IT,
WE'LL GET THEM.

08:55.467 --> 08:56.767
I STAND CORRECTED.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.667
WHAT ARE
THEY CALLED ?

08:57.700 --> 08:58.867
SPLASH GUARDS.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.333
GUYS, WE CAN'T
GET IT IN TIME.

09:00.367 --> 09:01.867
WE OPEN IN THREE DAYS.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.933
WE CAN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE THE BATHROOM
FIXED IN THREE DAYS.

09:04.967 --> 09:07.567
SO, WE'LL PEE AT HOME
FOR A WHILE BEFORE WE COME.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.233
HEY, EVERYBODY.

09:10.267 --> 09:11.600
WHO'S THIS ?

09:11.633 --> 09:12.667
IT'S OSCAR.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.267
MY FAMILY'S DOG,
NOT MY DOG.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.533
THIS DOG KILLS ME,
I'M SO ALLERGIC TO IT.

09:17.567 --> 09:20.067
I HAVE TO HANG WITH IT TODAY
'CAUSE SUSIE'S GOT SOME STUFF

09:20.067 --> 09:22.067
TO DO WITH TILING
AT THE NEW HOUSE.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.067
IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC,
WHY DO YOU HAVE THE DOG ?

09:24.067 --> 09:26.500
BECAUSE MY WIFE AND I WERE
SEPARATED FOR A WHILE,

09:26.533 --> 09:28.700
AND WHILE WE WERE SEPARATED,
SHE GOT THIS DOG,

09:28.733 --> 09:31.533
AND NOW, I'M BACK AND THE DOG
AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.133
YEAH, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.667
DON'T TOUCH YOUR EYES,
LIKE, DON'T...

09:34.700 --> 09:35.867
I'M NOT TOUCHING
ANYTHING.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.067
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

09:37.067 --> 09:38.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
OSCAR ?

09:38.300 --> 09:39.467
OSCAR !

09:39.500 --> 09:42.200
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH IT ?

09:42.233 --> 09:42.967
REALLY ACTING UP.

09:43.067 --> 09:43.767
NOT IN THE KITCHEN.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.900
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
OSCAR ?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.067
( growling )

09:51.100 --> 09:53.200
WHAT'S HE GOT ?

09:53.233 --> 09:55.533
DID SOMEBODY DROP
SOME MEAT OR SOMETHING ?

09:55.567 --> 09:58.700
NO, THAT FLOOR IS SPOTLESS
FOR THE HEALTH INSPECTION.

09:58.733 --> 10:02.100
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
HE SMELLS SOMETHING.

10:02.133 --> 10:04.267
ISN'T HE
A CORPSE-SNIFFING DOG ?

10:07.567 --> 10:09.200
( barking )

10:12.867 --> 10:14.300
WELL, FOLKS.

10:14.333 --> 10:18.000
THIS RESCUE CANINE
IS WELL-CREDENTIALED,

10:18.033 --> 10:21.167
AND I THINK THERE'S
A REAL STRONG POSSIBILITY

10:21.200 --> 10:23.667
THAT THERE'S A DEAD BODY
UNDERNEATH THAT FLOOR.

10:23.700 --> 10:28.167
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE
AN INVESTIGATION,

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
AND WE'LL HAVE
TO TEAR UP THE FLOOR.

10:30.133 --> 10:31.767
OH, COME ON,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.700
HOW LONG WILL
THAT TAKE ?

10:34.733 --> 10:35.800
I DON'T KNOW.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.233
OH, THIS IS
A NIGHTMARE.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.867
I'M TELLING YOU, I'M GONNA TAKE
MY MONEY OUT OF THIS PLACE.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.800
WELL, WHAT IF THERE'S
A DEAD BODY UNDER THERE ?

10:46.833 --> 10:48.700
WE'RE FUCKED, NO ONE WILL
EVER COME TO THEESTAURANT

10:48.733 --> 10:49.800
WHERE THEY FOUND
A DEAD BODY.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.300
IT'LL BE IN THE PAPERS,
WE'RE FUCKED.

10:51.333 --> 10:54.667
IF THERE'S A DEAD BODY
UNDERNEATH THERE,
WE ARE FUCKED.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.033
I CAN'T LIVE WITH THIS DOG,
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

10:57.067 --> 10:59.300
I MEAN,
MY EYES ARE BURNING.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.133
RIGHT HERE, I HAVE A PAIN
THAT IS SO SEVERE,

11:02.167 --> 11:03.500
FROM THAT
FREAKING DOG.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.633
I AM HIGHLY
ALLERGIC TO DOGS.

11:05.667 --> 11:07.233
YOU KNOW THE BRAUDYS ?

11:07.267 --> 11:10.500
THAT GUY WHO SMASHED
INTO ALANIS MORRISETTE ?

11:10.533 --> 11:11.533
OH THAT IDIOT.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.567
YEAH, THAT GUY.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.100
WE HAD DINNER WITH THEM
THE OTHER NIGHT.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.967
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A DOG FOR THE KIDS.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.600
AND I MENTIONED
TO OSCAR,

11:18.633 --> 11:21.633
THEY WOULD TAKE THAT DOG
OFF YOUR HANDS TOMORROW.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.400
MY DAUGHTER'S IN LOVE
WITH THAT DOG, WHAT DO I DO ?

11:24.433 --> 11:26.500
YOU'VE GOT TO SIT DOWN
AND TALK TO HER.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.433
AND TELL HER DADDY
CAN'T LIVE IN THIS HOUSE

11:28.467 --> 11:30.733
BECAUSE THE DOG
MAKES DADDY SICK
AND SHE'LL UNDERSTAND,

11:30.767 --> 11:31.600
DON'T YOU THINK ?

11:31.633 --> 11:34.067
YEAH, I THINK
SHE WOULD.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.400
I MEAN, EXPLAIN IT TO HER,
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:36.433 --> 11:38.600
IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL HER.

11:38.633 --> 11:39.700
TELL HER,
TALK TO HER.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.433
HOLD ON.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.700
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S OSCAR !

11:44.733 --> 11:47.467
LOOK AT THAT, HE CAME,
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.633
WHAT A GOOD BOY,
YEAH, IT'S NICE

11:48.667 --> 11:50.200
TO BE AFFECTIONATE
TO SOMETHING GERMAN.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.433
YOU DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY
THAT OFTEN, YOU KNOW ?

11:52.467 --> 11:53.867
GOOD BOY.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.433
DADDY DOESN'T
FEEL GOOD.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.367
SNEEZING.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.667
UP ALL NIGHT.

12:02.700 --> 12:03.933
IT HURTS RIGHT HERE.

12:03.967 --> 12:06.200
RIGHT HERE I HAVE A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE PAIN.

12:06.233 --> 12:07.933
AND MY EYES
ARE WATERING.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.967
AND I FEEL HORRIBLE.

12:10.067 --> 12:11.600
AND THE REASON THIS
IS ALL HAPPENING

12:11.633 --> 12:13.867
IS BECAUSE OF
YOUR PAL, OSCAR...

12:13.900 --> 12:15.500
ALRIGHT ?

12:15.533 --> 12:17.567
SO, YOU HAVE
TO DECIDE BETWEEN

12:17.600 --> 12:21.267
WHETHER YOU WANT
DADDY OR OSCAR.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.067
MM, OSCAR.

12:24.100 --> 12:28.067
NO, NO, WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
THAT IF YOU SAY OSCAR,

12:28.067 --> 12:29.467
DADDY WON'T BE HERE.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.167
I KNOW.

12:31.200 --> 12:31.867
YOU KNOW ?

12:31.900 --> 12:33.067
MM-HMM.

12:33.067 --> 12:36.567
BUT YOU'RE CHOOSING OSCAR,
I'M YOUR DAD.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.933
I JUST LOVE THAT DOG.

12:40.700 --> 12:43.533
MM-HMM.

12:43.567 --> 12:46.967
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.133
WE OPEN
IN THREE DAYS.

13:03.167 --> 13:04.533
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

13:04.567 --> 13:05.933
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
CALLED THE COPS.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.267
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN
BROUGHT THE DOG IN HERE

13:08.300 --> 13:09.200
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.933
( barking )

13:10.967 --> 13:12.967
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON ?

13:13.067 --> 13:15.100
HE FOUND SOMETHING,
HAS HE GOT SOMETHING ?

13:15.133 --> 13:16.800
WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND, HOLD ON.

13:16.833 --> 13:18.500
I THINK HE'S FOUND
SOMETHING.

13:18.533 --> 13:20.067
WHAT DO YOU
GOT THERE ?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.667
HOLY SHIT.

13:25.433 --> 13:28.133
WHAT DOES HE GOT ?

13:32.733 --> 13:36.200
A BRA ?

13:36.233 --> 13:38.067
IS THAT IT,
IS THERE MORE ?

13:38.100 --> 13:39.133
IS THERE, IS THERE
A BODY WITH IT ?

13:39.167 --> 13:41.267
NOTHING ELSE DOWN HERE,
THAT'S IT.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.667
THAT'S IT,
A BRA ?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.767
THAT'S IT FOLKS,
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE IN THERE.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.333
OH, MY GOD.

13:48.367 --> 13:52.267
WELL, HE'S
A BRA-SNIFFING DOG.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.267
HE'S A GOOD
BRA-SNIFFING DOG.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.767
TERRIFIC.
GREAT.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.300
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.333
ALL THIS FOR THAT ?

13:59.367 --> 14:00.900
MYSTERY IS SOLVED.

14:00.933 --> 14:03.133
HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE
TO GET ALL THIS BACK ?

14:03.167 --> 14:06.067
WELL, WITH WHAT YOU GOT
GOING ON HERE, IT'S A MESS.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.100
THEY DUG UP THE ELECTRIC,
THE GAS, THE PLUMBING, IT'S...

14:09.133 --> 14:10.167
SO, HOW LONG ?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.467
IT'S THREE WEEKS
TO A MONTH, LARRY.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.933
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
ON THE SAFE SIDE.

14:12.967 --> 14:14.667
THINGS COULD ARISE, YOU GOT
THE CITY INVOLVED NOW.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.800
LARRY, I'M SORRY, BUT.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.400
HEY, LET ME
ASK YOU THIS ?

14:18.433 --> 14:21.967
CAN WE GET THE SPLASH GUARDS
IN THE URINAL NOW ?

14:22.067 --> 14:23.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

14:23.067 --> 14:24.667
I'LL APPLY FOR THAT,
THAT'S GOOD, LARRY.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.933
WE'LL GET
THE SPLASH GUARDS.

14:25.967 --> 14:28.400
BLESSING IN DISGUISE.

14:30.567 --> 14:31.800
LARRY !

14:31.833 --> 14:33.667
A DOG !

14:33.700 --> 14:37.367
SHE CHOSE A FUCKING DOG
OVER HER OWN FATHER.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.233
YOU SAT DOWN,
YOU LAID IT OUT,
YOU TOLD HER ?

14:39.267 --> 14:41.133
I TOLD HER,
DADDY'S SICK.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.233
HE CAN'T STAY IN
THE SAME HOUSE WITH OSCAR.

14:43.267 --> 14:45.433
SHE WANTS OSCAR,
SHE WANTS THE DOG !

14:45.467 --> 14:46.467
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.067
WHERE IS THE DOG ?

14:48.100 --> 14:50.067
THEY TOOK HIM BACK
TO YOUR HOUSE.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.400
MY HOUSE ?

14:51.433 --> 14:54.967
NO, NO, HIS HOUSE, HIS HOUSE,
I LIVE AT THE W. HOTEL.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.367
IT'S HIS HOUSE NOW.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.600
BY THE WAY,
HE TURNED UP A BRA TODAY.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.100
THERE'S NO CORPSE.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.267
A BRA ?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.767
WHAT THE FUCK'S
WRONG WITH THAT DOG ?

15:04.800 --> 15:06.167
HE'S A BRA-SNIFFING DOG.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.567
A BRA-SNIFFING DOG,
WHAT THE FUCK ?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.167
HE'S CLOSING US DOWN
FOR THREE WEEKS NOW.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.233
BECAUSE OF A BRA ?

15:11.267 --> 15:12.567
YEAH, THEY DUG UP
THE WHOLE PLACE IN THE...

15:12.600 --> 15:14.067
THAT FUCKING DOG !

15:14.100 --> 15:16.333
HEY, TAKE IT,
TAKE IT EASY.

15:16.367 --> 15:20.200
I GOT TO CALL THAT
BALD CHEF AND TELL HIM.

15:20.233 --> 15:20.900
HE'S GONNA
BE DISAPPOINTED.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.100
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

15:22.133 --> 15:23.933
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

15:23.967 --> 15:26.067
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA BE,
AT THE W. HOTEL ?

15:26.067 --> 15:26.867
W. HOTEL.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.267
YOU'RE GONNA
HEAR FROM ME SOON.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.300
YOU'RE GONNA
HEAR FROM ME.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.267
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ?

15:31.300 --> 15:33.133
I GOT SOMETHING
TO TAKE CARE OF.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.767
FUCK !

15:44.800 --> 15:46.067
HI, LARRY.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.600
HI, SAMMI.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.133
MY MOMMY'S NEXT DOOR.

15:49.167 --> 15:50.367
SHE'LL BE HOME SOON.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.467
AND MY DADDY'S
AT A HOTEL.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.367
CAN I COME IN ?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.133
MM-HMM.

15:54.167 --> 15:55.433
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING ?

15:55.467 --> 15:56.733
GRAPE JUICE,
WANT SOME ?

15:56.767 --> 15:58.733
OH, POSITIVELY.

16:00.233 --> 16:05.967
ANYWAY, I ACTUALLY,
CAME TO TALK TO YOU.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.467
HMM.

16:14.567 --> 16:18.633
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK
I'M GONNA HAVE THIS INSTEAD.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.300
OKAY.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.733
I JUST WANT
TO TRY THIS WINE.

16:24.133 --> 16:28.233
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT
THIS STUFF AS THE NEXT GUY.

16:28.267 --> 16:29.700
COME ON.

16:37.933 --> 16:38.833
NO.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.633
TOO FRUITY.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.667
AND A TAD
ON THE OAKY SIDE.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.900
WHAT DOES OAKY MEAN ?

16:46.933 --> 16:48.700
IT TASTES LIKE A TREE.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.567
IT TASTES A LITTLE
LIKE A TREE.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.300
LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.733
OKAY ?

16:57.767 --> 17:00.633
ISN'T THERE ANOTHER ANIMAL
THAT WE COULD INTEREST YOU IN ?

17:00.667 --> 17:03.267
PERHAPS A LITTLE
PUSSY CAT ?

17:03.300 --> 17:05.100
I DON'T LIKE CATS.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.167
HOW ABOUT A RABBIT ?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.433
MM-MM.

17:08.467 --> 17:09.800
PONY ?

17:09.833 --> 17:12.267
I NEVER HEARD OF A LITTLE GIRL
THAT DIDN'T WANT A PONY.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.333
TURTLE ?

17:13.367 --> 17:14.500
TURTLES SCARE ME.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.067
HAMSTER.

17:16.067 --> 17:19.200
PUT HIM IN A CAGE AND YOU CAN
TORTURE THEM A LITTLE BIT.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.200
THEY'RE BORING.

17:20.233 --> 17:21.200
NO, BUT YOU TORTURE THEM.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.600
IT'S NOT BORING
IF YOU TORTURE THEM.

17:22.633 --> 17:25.333
I LIKE OSCAR BETTER.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.733
OH, WHAT IS THAT,
THAT DOG WHISTLE ?

17:28.767 --> 17:30.333
IS THAT OSCAR'S WHISTLE ?

17:30.367 --> 17:31.433
UH-HUH.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.167
I WOULDN'T BLOW IT,
HE'S ASLEEP.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.333
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.067
I SAW YOUR DADDY
USE IT THE OTHER DAY.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.833
HE CAME RUNNING OUT
OF THE RESTAURANT.

17:39.867 --> 17:44.067
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
THING WORKS ACTUALLY.

17:44.067 --> 17:46.467
WHERE'S THE WHISTLE PART ?

17:50.967 --> 17:54.100
ANYWAY, THAT'S MY SPIEL.

17:54.133 --> 17:58.167
SO, COME ON, SAMMI.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.867
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

17:59.900 --> 18:03.567
I DON'T WANT OSCAR.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.300
I WANT DADDY.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.267
GO HOME !

18:12.300 --> 18:14.633
IT'S ALL
TAKEN CARE OF.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.167
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.267
WE HAD A LITTLE CHAT.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.467
I'M TAKING HIM
TO THE BRAUDYS.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.100
HE'S SITTING RIGHT
NEXT TO ME.

18:24.133 --> 18:26.133
YOU'RE MORE
THAN WELCOME.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.667
ALRIGHT, MY FRIEND.

18:27.700 --> 18:28.433
GOOD-BYE.

18:31.167 --> 18:33.300
WELL, OSCEY BOY.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.300
HUH ?

18:34.333 --> 18:35.667
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
OSCEY BOY ?

18:35.700 --> 18:37.800
WE'RE GOING TO THE BRAUDYS,
YOU EXCITED ?

18:37.833 --> 18:38.900
ARE YOU EXCITED
ABOUT THE BRAUDYS ?

18:38.933 --> 18:40.300
COME HERE,
GIVE ME A KISS.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.933
GIVE ME A, GIVE UNCLE LARRY
A KISSY, THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

18:43.967 --> 18:44.867
OOH.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.067
ALRIGHT, LOOK AT
YOUR NEW HOME.

18:49.067 --> 18:52.433
YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD BOY.

18:52.467 --> 18:55.200
YEAH, YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD BOY !

18:57.467 --> 18:58.900
HELLO.

18:58.933 --> 19:00.167
HI.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.333
WELL ?

19:01.367 --> 19:03.367
HERE'S OSCAR.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.067
THIS IS
THE CORPSE-SNIFFING DOG

19:06.067 --> 19:07.167
I WAS TELLING YOU
ABOUT AT DINNER.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.100
RIGHT.
OSCAR.

19:08.133 --> 19:08.867
I REMEMBER DINNER.

19:08.900 --> 19:11.833
YEAH, ALL YOURS.

19:13.933 --> 19:16.267
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY TO ME, LARRY ?

19:16.300 --> 19:18.733
YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.

19:18.767 --> 19:22.167
NO, I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE TO SAY TO ME FROM DINNER ?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.900
I ENJOYED THE CHICKEN
VERY MUCH.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.867
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED
AT HOW GOOD IT WAS ACTUALLY.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.500
VERY FUNNY,
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

19:31.533 --> 19:34.433
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT,

19:34.467 --> 19:36.867
BUT YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW I FEEL
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT DINNER.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.067
LARRY, I'M WAITING,
I'M JUST WAITING.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.200
I'M STILL WAITING.

19:41.800 --> 19:46.800
WELL, I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE
TO CONTINUE TO WAIT

19:46.833 --> 19:50.367
IF IT'S A THANK YOU
THAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR.

19:50.400 --> 19:54.767
BECAUSE A THANK YOU IS JUST A
LITTLE MORE THAN YOU CAN HANDLE.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.633
NO, IT'S NOT MORE
THAN I CAN HANDLE.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.700
IF YOU HAD PAID
R THE MEAL,

19:58.733 --> 20:00.900
I WOULD'VE THANKED YOU
AS I TOLD YOU.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.033
OKAY.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.067
EXTRAORDINARY.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.367
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY,
IT'S A SHAME.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.933
SO, AM I TO ASSUME THAT
YOU DO NOT WANT THE DOG ?

20:07.967 --> 20:08.967
IS THIS WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME ?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.600
LARRY, IF YOU WANT
TO THANK ME FOR DINNER,

20:10.633 --> 20:12.433
THEN I WILL
LOOK AT YOUR DOG.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.233
I THANK PEOPLE WHEN
THEY DESERVE TO BE THANKED.

20:14.267 --> 20:15.600
MM-HMM.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.867
IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE, YOU
DO NOT DESERVE TO BE THANKED.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.233
BECAUSE A MAN
AND A WOMAN ARE MARRIED--

20:19.267 --> 20:22.133
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T WORKED A DAY
SINCE YOU GOT OUT OF COLLEGE,

20:22.167 --> 20:23.700
YOU'VE NEVER
HELD A JOB.

20:23.733 --> 20:24.967
HEY, LOOK IT'S A DOG.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
DOGGIE !

20:26.033 --> 20:27.767
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.400
LEAVE THE DOGGIE ALONE,
HE'S NOT OUR DOG.

20:29.433 --> 20:30.533
HIS NAME'S OSCAR.

20:30.567 --> 20:31.500
THAT'S LARRY'S DOG.

20:31.533 --> 20:32.967
I WANTED TO GIVE
THIS DOG TO YOU,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.333
BUT YOUR MOMMY
DOESN'T WANT IT.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.967
DON'T BE SILLY, YOU WEREN'T
GONNA GIVE HIM TO ME.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.100
IT'S YOUR DOG, LARRY.

20:38.133 --> 20:41.233
AT SOME POINT
WE'RE GONNA GET A DOG.

20:41.267 --> 20:42.633
DADDY AND I WERE
TALKING, BUT...

20:42.667 --> 20:43.700
OH, HE'S SUCH A GOOD DOG.

20:43.733 --> 20:44.967
NOT THIS DOG.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.233
WE'LL GO LOOK FOR A DOG
SOME PLACE ELSE.

20:47.267 --> 20:49.633
WHY GO LOOK FOR ONE
WHEN THERE'S ONE RIGHT HERE ?

20:49.667 --> 20:50.700
YEAH.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.000
PLEASE ?

20:52.033 --> 20:53.433
PLEASE ?

20:53.467 --> 20:56.400
OKAY, OKAY,
ALRIGHT.

20:56.433 --> 20:57.667
HERE YOU GO, BOYS.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.533
LET'S GO.
COOL.

20:59.567 --> 21:00.733
HEY, HEY,
WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

21:00.767 --> 21:01.733
( boys )
THANK YOU !

21:01.767 --> 21:03.800
YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:03.833 --> 21:06.567
HE SLEEPS ON MY BED.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.333
ENJOY.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.200
OH, SHIT.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.433
YOU SICK FUCK,
LARRY DAVID !

21:35.467 --> 21:37.633
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING

21:37.667 --> 21:39.167
GETTING MY KID DRUNK ?!

21:39.200 --> 21:41.067
DRUNK, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

21:41.067 --> 21:43.967
SHE'S SLURRING HER WORDS,
SHE'S BUMPING INTO THINGS.

21:44.067 --> 21:46.967
SHE STINKS LIKE
A FUCKIN' WINO !

21:48.600 --> 21:52.167
OH, I POURED SOME OF YOUR--
I HAD POURED SOME WINE.

21:52.200 --> 21:56.933
OH, SHE MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY,
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD KID,

21:56.967 --> 21:58.067
DRANK SOME WINE ?

21:58.067 --> 21:59.800
IT WAS A,
THE GLASSES GOT...

21:59.833 --> 22:02.667
DO I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT,
THAT I'M GON BELIEVE YOU ?

22:02.700 --> 22:05.500
YOU GOT HER DRUNK AND YOU STOLE
THE FUCKING DOG, ALRIGHT ?!

22:05.533 --> 22:08.133
NO, SHE TOLD ME
I COULD HAVE THE DOG.

22:08.167 --> 22:09.767
SHE TOLD YOU
YOU COULD TAKE THE DOG

22:09.800 --> 22:12.900
AFTER YOU GOT HER
ALL FUCKED UP ON ALCOHOL.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.333
ALL LIQUORED UP.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.133
I THOUGHT SHE HAD
A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.

22:16.167 --> 22:18.600
YOU'VE KNOWN THE KID
SINCE SHE WAS BORN,

22:18.633 --> 22:21.967
AND SHE SUDDENLY DEVELOPS
A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.

22:22.067 --> 22:23.867
THAT'S WHAT WAS
SO PUZZLING TO ME.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.067
OH, LISTEN,
YOU FOUR-EYED FUCK.

22:25.067 --> 22:26.267
YOU STOLE THE DOG !

22:26.300 --> 22:29.867
SHE'S AT HOME HYSTERICAL
THAT HER DOG IS GONE !

22:29.900 --> 22:31.300
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU DID TO HIM.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.300
MAYBE YOU BROUGHT HIM FOR SOME
ANIMAL TESTING OR SOMETHING,

22:34.333 --> 22:37.433
YOU SICKO
FUCKO ASSHOLE.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.500
GET ME THE FUCKING DOG !

22:55.600 --> 22:57.533
FIRST OF ALL,

22:57.567 --> 23:02.067
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.533
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT GOT INTO ME.

23:08.567 --> 23:11.367
I WAS SO WRONG
ABOUT THAT.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.467
YOU'RE MARRIED,
YOU'RE A COUPLE.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.800
OF COURSE
YOU GET THANKED.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.900
IT'S A 50/50 THING.

23:17.933 --> 23:19.600
SO, WHAT IF HE WORKS
AND YOU DON'T ?

23:19.633 --> 23:21.267
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.167
YOU'RE A HOUSEWIFE,
YOU RAISE THE KIDS.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.667
YOU'VE GOT KIDS,
THAT'S A FULL TIME JOB.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.700
AND YOU DESERVE
A THANK YOU.

23:28.733 --> 23:30.933
AND I WAS DEAD WRONG.

23:30.967 --> 23:33.267
AND I'M SORRY.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.800
THANK YOU.

23:34.833 --> 23:37.133
I...

23:37.167 --> 23:38.767
THAT'S GREAT.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.700
THAT WASN'T EASY TO DO
AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.

23:42.733 --> 23:46.500
YOU KNOW WHAT, ONCE
I REALIZED THE SITUATION

23:46.533 --> 23:49.333
AND HOW WRONG I WAS,
IT WAS EASY TO DO.

23:49.367 --> 23:52.200
I'M VERY,
I AM IMPRESSED.

23:52.233 --> 23:56.900
AND LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE WRONG,
YOU'RE WRONG, YOU KNOW ?

23:56.933 --> 23:59.400
I JUST DIDN'T,
BUT THANK YOU.

23:59.433 --> 24:02.900
GOOD, GOOD.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.500
HOW'S THE DOG
WORKING OUT ?

24:06.533 --> 24:08.500
THE DOG IS
ACTUALLY GREAT.

24:08.533 --> 24:09.333
REALLY ?

24:09.367 --> 24:10.733
YEAH, THE KIDS
ARE LOVING HIM.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.800
THEY'RE LOVING HIM,
HE'S SWEET AS CAN BE.

24:12.833 --> 24:14.867
AND WELL TRAINED, JUST LIKE
YOU SAID, HE'S TERRIFIC.

24:14.900 --> 24:16.500
I'LL TELL YOU
WHY I'M ASKING,

24:16.533 --> 24:20.567
BECAUSE SOMETHING'S
COME UP AND...

24:22.433 --> 24:27.067
THE OWNER OF THE DOG,
ACTUALLY WANTS THE DOG BACK.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.167
I JUST LEFT HER, AND...

24:30.200 --> 24:33.333
HER KID'S PRETTY
BROKEN UP ABOUT IT.

24:33.367 --> 24:36.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

24:36.233 --> 24:40.567
WELL, IT'S A LONG STORY,
BUT WHEN HER DAUGHTER TOLD ME

24:40.600 --> 24:41.733
I COULD HAVE THE DOG.

24:41.767 --> 24:44.367
SHE WAS QUITE DRUNK AT
THE TIME, UNBEKNOWNST TO ME.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.067
SHE'S DRUNK,
HOW OLD IS THIS GIRL ?

24:46.100 --> 24:47.900
SEVEN.

24:47.933 --> 24:49.600
ANYWAY.

24:49.633 --> 24:51.633
SO, WHEN SHE SAID
I COULD HAVE THE DOG

24:51.667 --> 24:53.233
SHE WASN'T IN HER...
DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF HER SENSES.

24:53.267 --> 24:54.467
ALRIGHT, OKAY, OKAY.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.567
ALRIGHT, SO NOW
I UNDERSTAND.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.100
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

24:59.133 --> 25:01.433
NO, I CAME TO THANK YOU
FOR DINNER.

25:01.467 --> 25:04.067
GOD, I JUST KNEW IT,
I KNEW IT.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.400
AND AS LONG AS I'M HERE
I'LL TAKE THE DOG.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.833
AS LONG AS YOU
HAPPEN TO BE HERE,
YOU'LL TAKE THE DOG BACK.

25:08.867 --> 25:10.233
WHAT ARE YOU, SICK ?

25:10.267 --> 25:13.167
I'M ONLY ASKING,
I REALLY NEED IT.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.400
I MEAN, SHE WANTS
THE DOG BACK.

25:14.433 --> 25:16.367
IT'S HER DOG,
IT IS HER DOG.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.633
NO, IT'S NOT HER DOG
ANYMORE, LARRY,

25:17.667 --> 25:19.100
BECAUSE YOU
BROUGHT IT HERE.

25:19.133 --> 25:20.767
YOU'VE HAD IT FOR A HALF HOUR
SO, YOU THINK IT'S YOUR DOG ?

25:20.800 --> 25:22.067
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

25:22.067 --> 25:24.067
OSCEY.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.900
JUST GET, LEAVE,
LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

25:26.933 --> 25:29.067
LEAVE OR I AM
CALLING THE POLICE.

25:29.100 --> 25:29.900
I'M SORRY.

25:29.933 --> 25:30.667
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
THE DOG ?

25:30.700 --> 25:31.433
NO, I AM NOT.

25:31.467 --> 25:32.767
I'M NOT GIVING YOU MY DOG.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.400
WELL, YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
DISAPPOINT A LITTLE GIRL.

25:34.433 --> 25:38.467
WELL, LARRY, YOU GO BACK AND
TELL HER TO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.600
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT
GETTING HER DOG BACK, OKAY ?

25:40.633 --> 25:43.333
OKAY, I TAKE BACK
MY THANK YOU, BY THE WAY.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.067
THE ONE THAT YOU NEVER
ACTUALLY GAVE ME ANYWAY.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.300
OKAY, BYE, LARRY.

25:46.333 --> 25:49.067
B'BYE, NOW,
B'BYE, NOW !

25:49.100 --> 25:50.567
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.100
YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
I WILL BE CALLING THE POLICE.

25:53.133 --> 25:54.933
GO, B'BYE.

25:54.967 --> 25:57.200
I HAVE TO GO
WALK MY DOG.

25:57.233 --> 26:00.367
THEN I'M GONNA HAVE HIM
DO A LITTLE FETCHING FOR ME.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.867
WE MIGHT HOP INTO
THE POOL.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.533
BYE, LARRY.

26:03.567 --> 26:06.333
BYE, NO, KEEP GOING.

26:06.367 --> 26:08.167
