SO, I WENT TO SEE HIM.

09:54.554 --> 09:57.888
I WENT OUT THE OTHER NIGHT
TO GRAB A PACK OF SMOKES,

09:57.888 --> 10:00.430
AND SOMEONE
GRABS ME FROM BEHIND

10:00.430 --> 10:03.313
AND PUTS SOMETHING
OVER MY MOUTH.

10:03.313 --> 10:04.815
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I-I-I'M TIED TO A CHAIR

10:04.815 --> 10:06.647
AND THIS GUY
IS SITTING IN FRONT OF ME.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.488
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

10:08.488 --> 10:11.571
I-IT WAS
REALLY BLURRY.

10:11.571 --> 10:13.403
MY GLASSES GOT KNOCKED OFF
WHEN I WAS GRABBED.

10:13.403 --> 10:14.825
THE FBI LADY
LENT ME THESE.

10:14.825 --> 10:17.407
I UNDERSTAND YOU TESTED POSITIVE
FOR HEROIN.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.499
I KNOW
WHAT EVERYONE THINKS.

10:19.499 --> 10:21.952
OKAY,
BUT THIS GUY -- HE'S REAL.

10:21.952 --> 10:24.795
HE WAS THE ONE WHO SHOT ME UP,
OVER AND OVER.

10:24.795 --> 10:27.297
AND EACH TIME, HE'D ASK ME
ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

10:27.297 --> 10:28.799
WHAT QUESTIONS?

10:28.799 --> 10:30.841
I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE --

10:30.841 --> 10:34.755
LIKE HE'S A-A COP
INTERROGATING ME OR SOMETHING.

10:34.755 --> 10:38.018
LOOK, THIS IS NO NICKEL BAG
OF LEMONADE, HERE.

10:38.018 --> 10:39.810
THIS STUFF
IS PURE.

10:42.853 --> 10:45.686
I-I PRETENDED TO PASS OUT,
AND WHEN HE LEFT ME ALONE,

10:45.686 --> 10:47.477
I BUSTED THE HELL
OUT OF THERE.

10:47.477 --> 10:48.899
NEXT THING I KNOW,

10:48.899 --> 10:51.191
A COUPLE OF COPS
ARE WAKING ME UP ON A BENCH.

10:51.191 --> 10:53.613
HIS STORY HAD NONE
OF THE HALLMARKS OF PSYCHOSIS,

10:53.613 --> 10:56.326
SO I TOLD BISHOP
I-I-I THOUGHT SHE WAS RIGHT.

10:56.326 --> 10:57.738
JUSTIN
HAD BEEN ABDUCTED.

10:57.738 --> 10:59.780
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO

10:59.780 --> 11:01.451
WITH THIS DRUG DEALER
OR HIS TRIAL.

11:01.451 --> 11:03.623
WHY NOT?

11:03.623 --> 11:04.955
WHY WOULD A BIG-TIME DEALER
BOTHER TO KIDNAP THIS KID?

11:04.955 --> 11:06.707
I MEAN,
WHY NOT JUST KILL HIM?

11:06.707 --> 11:08.879
WELL, MAYBE THE DRUG DEALER
HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR JUSTIN.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.500
HE HAD MADE HIM
A LOT OF MONEY.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.752
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT BISHOP SAID.

11:11.752 --> 11:13.633
SO IF IT WASN'T
THE DEALER,

11:13.633 --> 11:14.755
WHO ARE YOU SUGGESTING
KIDNAPPED JUSTIN?

11:14.755 --> 11:17.347
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S FIND OUT.

11:17.347 --> 11:18.889
HOLD ON.
SO WE'RE CLEAR --

11:18.889 --> 11:20.560
IT'S YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION
THAT JUSTIN IS TELLING THE TRUTH

11:20.560 --> 11:22.062
ABOUT BEING ABDUCTED,
IS THAT CORRECT?

11:22.062 --> 11:23.683
YES, BUT --

11:23.683 --> 11:24.684
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
DR. PIERCE.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.936
WAIT -- WAIT,
SO THAT'S IT?

11:25.936 --> 11:27.647
I TOLD YOU
AN HOUR OF YOUR TIME.

11:27.647 --> 11:28.979
BUT WAIT, YOU CAN'T JUST
DANGLE A PUZZLE IN FRONT OF ME

11:28.979 --> 11:30.650
AND NOT
LET ME SOLVE IT.

11:30.650 --> 11:34.614
I CALLED YOU IN FOR A CONSULT,
NOT TO PLAY MULDER AND SCULLY.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.657
PLAY WHAT?

11:37.657 --> 11:40.700
A FEW WEEKS LATER, I READ
IN THE PAPER ABOUT THIS
RASH OF OVERDOSES --

11:40.700 --> 11:42.913
PEOPLE TURNING UP DEAD,
NEEDLES STILL IN THEIR ARMS.

11:42.913 --> 11:46.626
THE SYRINGES CONTAIN RESIDUE
OF PHARMACEUTICAL-GRADE HEROIN.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.248
NOW,
ACCORDING TO THE STORY,

11:48.248 --> 11:50.670
SOME OF THESE FATALITIES
WERE FIRST-TIME USERS

11:50.670 --> 11:52.753
AND, LIKE JUSTIN, THEY
DISAPPEARED FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS

11:52.753 --> 11:54.594
BEFORE THEIR BODIES
WERE FOUND.

11:54.594 --> 11:56.636
SO I STARTED
DOING SOME DIGGING ON MY OWN,

11:56.636 --> 11:57.838
TALKED
TO THE FAMILIES.

11:57.838 --> 11:59.970
TURNS OUT
A LOT OF THESE VICTIMS

11:59.970 --> 12:03.603
HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED
WITH SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDERS --

12:03.603 --> 12:05.515
BIPOLAR, BORDERLINE PERSONALITY,
SCHIZOPHRENIA.

12:05.515 --> 12:08.268
SO I WENT TO BISHOP.
I TOLD HER WHAT I HAD FOUND.

12:08.268 --> 12:09.649
A SERIAL KILLER?
YES, YES.

12:09.649 --> 12:10.941
HE'S TARGETING
THE MENTALLY ILL,

12:10.941 --> 12:13.443
SHOOTING THEM UP WITH HEROIN,
AND INTERROGATING THEM.

12:13.443 --> 12:14.815
WHY?
I DON'T KNOW.

12:14.815 --> 12:16.696
MAYBE HE'S SOME SICKO THAT LIKES
CHATTING UP HIS VICTIMS

12:16.696 --> 12:18.568
BEFORE HE KILLS THEM.

12:18.568 --> 12:19.780
IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE POINT IS,
IT'S THE PERFECT MURDER --

12:19.780 --> 12:21.031
LEAVE THE BODIES
IN THE STREET

12:21.031 --> 12:23.123
WITH A NEEDLE FULL OF HEROIN
IN THEIR ARM

12:23.123 --> 12:25.455
AND POLICE JUST THINK
THAT THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF JUNKIES WHO O.D.'d.

12:25.455 --> 12:27.077
OKAY, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THIS?

12:27.077 --> 12:28.668
LOOK, THE CORONER
WON'T RETURN MY CALLS.

12:28.668 --> 12:30.540
JUST ASK HIM

12:30.540 --> 12:32.132
HOW MANY OTHER O.D. CASES
LIKE THIS ARE OUT THERE.

12:32.132 --> 12:34.134
W-W-WE FIND THE PATTERN,
WE FIGURE OUT THIS GUY'S M.O.,

12:34.134 --> 12:35.635
WE CAN CATCH
THE SON OF A BITCH.

12:35.635 --> 12:38.428
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S THIN.

12:38.428 --> 12:41.471
IF THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE
THAT I'M RIGHT ABOUT THIS...

12:41.471 --> 12:43.884
YOU WANT THESE DEATHS
ON YOUR CONSCIENCE?

12:43.884 --> 12:46.726
A WEEK LATER,
BISHOP FINALLY GOT BACK TO ME.

12:46.726 --> 12:48.438
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]
HELLO?

12:48.438 --> 12:49.940
ANNE-MARIE: It's Bishop.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.062
I think there may be something
to your theory after all.

12:52.062 --> 12:55.775
Meet me in the office first
thing so we can talk about it.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.658
BUT SHE NEVER SHOWED.

12:58.658 --> 13:00.610
BECAUSE
SHE WAS ABDUCTED.

13:00.610 --> 13:02.782
I FIGURED
THE KILLER MUST HAVE REALIZED

13:02.782 --> 13:04.164
THAT BISHOP
WAS ON TO HIM,

13:04.164 --> 13:06.666
SO HE GRABBED HER AND WHATEVER
EVIDENCE SHE'D COME UP WITH.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.869
I TRIED TO TELL HER BOSS,
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

13:08.869 --> 13:11.962
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANY SERIAL KILLER.

13:11.962 --> 13:14.504

WITH THE ULRICH PROSECUTION.

13:14.504 --> 13:16.756
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO UPDATE THE PRESS.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.590
THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING.

13:20.590 --> 13:23.053
AS YOU KNOW, FBI SPECIAL AGENT

13:23.053 --> 13:25.515

LAST NIGHT.

TODAY, WE'RE ANNOUNCING
A $1 MILLION REWARD

13:30.140 --> 13:31.852

WITH PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS.

13:34.194 --> 13:35.695

ON HEROIN

13:37.607 --> 13:39.109
HEY!

13:39.109 --> 13:40.700
AND IF THE FBI
DOESN'T WAKE UP,

13:40.700 --> 13:41.992

ARE GONNA DIE!

13:44.444 --> 13:46.616
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE WORKING WITH BISHOP.

13:46.616 --> 13:48.999
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.710
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I DID CALL.

HEARD FROM YOU.

TO AFFORD THAT SUIT.

IF THE KILLER HAD BEEN WATCHING,

14:43.423 --> 14:45.675
I'D BASICALLY TOLD HIM
THAT I WAS ON TO HIM, TOO.

14:45.675 --> 14:48.638

HE COULD CERTAINLY GET TO ME.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.475
MAYBE THERE NEVER WAS
A SERIAL KILLER.

14:56.856 --> 14:58.898
MAYBE AGENT BISHOP WAS TAKEN
BY THAT DRUG DEALER.

WERE ON SABBATICAL.

28:27.496 --> 28:28.788
NO, NOT YET.

28:28.788 --> 28:30.669
WELL, WHEN YOU DO,

28:30.669 --> 28:34.333
AND YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE ANGEL
GETS KNIFED BY A LUNATIC,

28:34.333 --> 28:36.756
THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
MY ANGER.

28:36.756 --> 28:40.760
COLUMBINE, VIRGINIA TECH,
SANDY HOOK --

28:40.760 --> 28:43.012
THAT'S A LOT OF DEAD SONS
AND DAUGHTERS,

28:43.012 --> 28:45.935
MURDERED BY CRAZY PEOPLE
WHO SHOULD'VE BEEN LOCKED AWAY

28:45.935 --> 28:47.726
WHERE THEY
COULDN'T HURT KIDS.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.398
THE WAY
ARTHUR ROSS JOHNSON,

28:49.398 --> 28:52.021
THE SCUMBAG WHO KNIFED
YOUR DAUGHTER, IS LOCKED AWAY?

28:52.021 --> 28:54.443
BECAUSE I HEAR HE'S LIVING IT UP
IN JERSEYVILLE PSYCH,

28:54.443 --> 28:56.235
GETTING THREE HOT MEALS
AND CABLE TV.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.656
WHERE'S THE JUSTICE
IN THAT?

28:57.656 --> 28:59.358
HEY, DAMN RIGHT!

28:59.358 --> 29:00.910
I'M GLAD
SOMEONE'S TAKING A STAND.

29:00.910 --> 29:03.492
THAT SOMEONE
BEING YOU.

29:03.492 --> 29:08.367
WE FOUND THREE KILOGRAMS
OF PHARMACEUTICAL-GRADE HEROIN

29:08.367 --> 29:10.629
TAPED BEHIND
YOUR WATER HEATER.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.426
I WANT A LAWYER.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.685
GREAT WORK,
PAL.

29:26.685 --> 29:28.477
DID [SIGHS]

29:28.477 --> 29:29.849
HEY, HEY.

29:29.849 --> 29:31.851
D-D-DOESN'T IT SEEM
A-A TAD TOO EASY,

29:31.851 --> 29:33.772
THE WAY
HE FELL INTO OUR LAPS?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.024
KILLERS MAKE MISTAKES,
TOO.

29:35.024 --> 29:37.026
I KNOW,
BUT LOOK AT THIS GUY.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.448
HE HATES PEOPLE WITH
MENTAL ILLNESS. IF HE WAS
KILLING THEM, HE'D JUST --

29:39.448 --> 29:41.240
HE'D JUST BASH THEIR
DISEASED BRAINS IN WITH A BRICK.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.863
WHY USE HEROIN?
IT MAKES PEOPLE EUPHORIC.

29:43.863 --> 29:45.404
WE FOUND THE DRUGS.

29:45.404 --> 29:46.956
YEAH, YEAH.
AND --

29:46.956 --> 29:48.747
WHAT ABOUT --
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

29:48.747 --> 29:50.539
WHERE -- WHERE DOES
A GUY LIKE THIS

29:50.539 --> 29:52.671
GET HIS HANDS ON
PHARMACEUTICAL-GRADE NARCOTICS?

29:52.671 --> 29:54.964
WELL, PROBABLY OFF THE INTERNET,
OFF ONE OF THOSE DRUG SITES.

29:54.964 --> 29:56.715
EVERY TIME WE SHUT ONE DOWN,
ANOTHER ONE JUST POPS UP.

29:56.715 --> 29:58.257
O-OKAY,
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR?

29:58.257 --> 30:00.759
WELL, HE PROBABLY DITCHED IT.
BUT WE'LL FIND IT.

30:00.759 --> 30:03.222
BUT WHAT IF THE REAL KILLER
IS FRAMING DUXBURY?

30:03.222 --> 30:04.593
THINK --
THINK ABOUT IT!

30:04.593 --> 30:05.885
THIS GUY'S
THE PERFECT PATSY.

30:05.885 --> 30:08.477
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THAT TASHA LIED?

30:08.477 --> 30:10.769
NO, NO, NO.
I-I-I-I DON'T KNOW.

30:10.769 --> 30:12.311
M-MAYBE THE KILLER
FED HER MISINFORMATION.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.194
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
THE GUY WE'RE LOOKING FOR,

30:15.194 --> 30:17.897
WE'RE DEALING
WITH A BRILLIANT MIND, HERE.

30:17.897 --> 30:19.738
HELL OF A LOT SMARTER THAN YOU,
THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.

30:19.738 --> 30:21.570
WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
EXCUSE ME?

30:21.570 --> 30:23.532
NOT -- NOT --
NOT YOU, KATE.

30:23.532 --> 30:25.534
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

30:25.534 --> 30:28.707
DO I
LOOK ALL RIGHT?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.332
I'M CERTIFIABLE.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.414
SOMEBODY SHOULD GET
A COURT ORDER

30:35.414 --> 30:38.337
AND LOCK ME UP
BEFORE I HURT SOMEONE.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.379
GET THE HELL AWAY
FROM ME.

30:40.379 --> 30:42.761
DANIEL, I THINK
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE YOU HOME.

30:42.761 --> 30:44.093
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU THERE.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.018
LEWICKI'S USELESS,
NATALIE'S GONE.

30:49.018 --> 30:52.471
YOU NEED --
YOU NEED TO SEE ROSENTHAL.

30:52.471 --> 30:54.143
SCREW ROSENTHAL!

30:56.565 --> 30:59.278
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S GO.
LET'S JUST GO.

30:59.278 --> 31:01.440
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GONNA STOP YOURSELF

31:01.440 --> 31:03.482
FROM ENDING UP
LIKE ME.

31:03.482 --> 31:05.694
DANIEL.

31:07.326 --> 31:09.448
HEY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:12.491 --> 31:14.753
I NEED
TO SEE MY DOCTOR.

31:24.133 --> 31:26.715
I'M GLAD YOU CAME BACK,
DANIEL.

31:26.715 --> 31:29.558
YOU'RE REACHING OUT.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

31:31.140 --> 31:34.143
TELL ME WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
SINCE OUR LEST SESSION.

31:34.143 --> 31:36.185
IT'S ALL HERE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

31:36.185 --> 31:39.068
THE SERIAL KILLER ABDUCTED
A WOMAN NAMED TASHA OGDEN,

31:39.068 --> 31:41.360
BUT WHEN THE COPS
SPOTTED HIS S.U.V.,

31:41.360 --> 31:42.901
HE THREW HER OUT
AND ESCAPED.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.154
TASHA KNEW
JUST ENOUGH ABOUT HER ABDUCTOR

31:45.154 --> 31:49.828
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY
A MAN NAMED TED DUXBURY.

31:49.828 --> 31:51.200
THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.

31:51.200 --> 31:55.164
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM --
TED DUXBURY IS NOT THE KILLER.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.746
DANIEL, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE SPIRALING.

31:57.746 --> 31:59.999
YOU JUST SAID THAT THE EVIDENCE
POINTS TO THIS MAN.

31:59.999 --> 32:03.002
YEAH, YEAH, I NEED YOU
TO WORK WITH ME HERE. OKAY?

32:03.002 --> 32:04.753
OKAY.
THE REAL KILLER'S...

32:04.753 --> 32:06.715
IS INGENIOUS.

32:06.715 --> 32:09.138
HE'S SO INGENIOUS THAT HE WAS
ABLE TO KILL PEOPLE FOR YEARS,

32:09.138 --> 32:11.010
AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT

32:11.010 --> 32:13.142
THAT THESE MURDERS
WERE ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES.

32:13.142 --> 32:14.763
YOU SEE,
HE'S, UH...

32:14.763 --> 32:16.815
HE'S -- HE'S SUBTLE.
HE'S SUBTLE.

32:16.815 --> 32:18.727
SO WHY,
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

32:18.727 --> 32:20.980
WOULD HE DO SOMETHING
AS CRASS AND OBVIOUS

32:20.980 --> 32:23.942
AS ABDUCTING A WOMAN
RIGHT AFTER BISHOP WAS FOUND?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.865
IF ANYTHING, HE'D --
HE'D LIE LOW FOR A WHILE.

32:26.865 --> 32:29.408
MAYBE KILLING IS A COMPULSION
HE CAN'T RESIST.

32:29.408 --> 32:31.780
I MEAN, IN THE SAME WAY
THAT YOU FEEL COMPELLED

32:31.780 --> 32:33.993
TO KEEP INVESTIGATING CASES
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLVED.

32:33.993 --> 32:37.786
THE KILLER WANTED US
TO FIND DUXBURY.

32:37.786 --> 32:40.039
DON'T YOU SEE?

32:40.039 --> 32:43.252
DANIEL, I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS,

32:43.252 --> 32:44.843
BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

32:44.843 --> 32:47.386
IT JUST --
IT SOUNDS...IMPLAUSIBLE.

32:47.386 --> 32:50.799
THE KILLER -- THE KILLER
NEEDED SOMEONE WITH A MOTIVE,

32:50.799 --> 32:52.801
AND DUXBURY HAD THAT
IN SPADES.

32:52.801 --> 32:54.223
THE -- THE --
THE ATTACK ON HIS DAUGHTER

32:54.223 --> 32:55.804
IN THE PLAYGROUND,
THAT WAS BIG NEWS.

32:55.804 --> 32:58.057
BUT IT BECAME
EVEN BIGGER WHEN --

32:58.057 --> 33:00.649
WHEN HE TRIED TO TAKE JUSTICE
INTO HIS OWN HANDS, YOU SEE?

33:00.649 --> 33:01.810
SO, ONCE -- SO, ONCE --
ONCE THE KILLER FOUND OUT

33:01.810 --> 33:04.653
THAT WE WERE LOOKING
FOR HIS S.U.V...

33:07.486 --> 33:09.818
THAT DOESN'T --
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

33:09.818 --> 33:12.451
WE DIDN'T RELEASE
THAT INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA.

33:12.451 --> 33:14.663
HOW COULD HE
HAVE KNOWN THAT?

33:14.663 --> 33:17.826
HE COULDN'T.
SO YOUR THEORY MUST BE WRONG.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.002
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE S.U.V.

33:25.624 --> 33:27.926
DANIEL,
WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

33:27.926 --> 33:30.969
[ SCOFFS ]

33:33.222 --> 33:35.844
IT ALL ADDS UP.
I -- YOU...

33:38.267 --> 33:39.808
YOU -- YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD

33:39.808 --> 33:42.811
TO CONVINCE THAT THIS KILLER
WAS A FIGMENT OF MY IMAGINATION.

33:42.811 --> 33:44.693
YOU TOLD ME
I'D NEVER GET HEALTHY AGAIN

33:44.693 --> 33:46.855
UNLESS I COULD
LET IT ALL GO.

33:48.357 --> 33:50.409
YOU'RE THE SERIAL KILLER.

33:50.409 --> 33:54.953
DANIEL, YOU UNDERSTAND THE
PATIENT/THERAPIST RELATIONSHIP

33:54.953 --> 33:56.495
AS WELL AS ANYONE.

33:56.495 --> 34:00.038
YOU'RE PROJECTING YOUR FEELINGS
FOR THE MURDERER ONTO ME.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.830
I MEAN, YOU'RE DRAWING
CONNECTIONS THAT JUST
AREN'T THERE.

34:01.830 --> 34:03.922
NO. NO, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
TALK ME OUT OF IT THIS TIME.

34:03.922 --> 34:07.296
YOU PLANTED -- YOU PLANTED THAT
HEROIN IN DUXBURY'S BASEMENT.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.088
THEN YOU ABDUCTED TASHA

34:09.088 --> 34:11.880
AND FILLED HER HEAD
WITH A BUNCH OF LIES.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.011
SHE NEVER DID
GET A LOOK AT YOU.

34:13.011 --> 34:15.134
AND THEN -- THEN --
YOU DROVE AROUND

34:15.134 --> 34:18.307
WAITING FOR THE COPS
TO SPOT YOUR STOLEN PLATES.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.938
WHEN THEY DID,
YOU THREW HER OUT, KNOWING --

34:19.938 --> 34:22.441
KNOWING THAT SHE WOULD
IMPLICATE DUXBURY. THAT'S...

34:22.441 --> 34:23.892
THAT'S A BRILLIANT PLAN.

34:23.892 --> 34:25.144
THERE ARE, WHAT...

34:25.144 --> 34:28.317
FIVE MILLION PEOPLE
IN THE GREATER CHICAGO AREA?

34:28.317 --> 34:31.110
HOW LIKELY IS IT,
IN A CITY OF THIS SIZE,

34:31.110 --> 34:35.954
THAT THE KILLER JUST HAPPENS
TO BE YOUR THERAPIST?

34:35.954 --> 34:39.288
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:39.288 --> 34:42.541
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT COULDN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.963
I'LL BET
YOU SAW ME ON THE NEWS.

34:44.963 --> 34:46.335
YEAH. [ SCOFFS ]
MUST HAVE BEEN --

34:46.335 --> 34:48.967
MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A RELIEF
WHEN -- WHEN -- WHEN THE FBI

34:48.967 --> 34:51.089
BLAMED A DRUG DEALER
FOR BISHOP'S DISAPPEARANCE.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.921
BUT THEN I STUPIDLY
JUMP UP THERE AND SAY,

34:52.921 --> 34:54.343
"NO, NO, THEY'RE WRONG!
THEY'RE WRONG!

34:54.343 --> 34:56.925
"SHE WAS ABDUCTED
BY A -- BY A SERIAL KILLER,

34:56.925 --> 34:58.137
AND I PROMISE
TO FIND HIM."

34:58.137 --> 35:00.979
TO FIND YOU.

35:00.979 --> 35:03.272
YOU REALIZED
I WAS A THREAT, SO YOU --

35:03.272 --> 35:05.274
YOU MUST HAVE -- YOU MUST HAVE
GONE LOOKING FOR ME.

35:05.274 --> 35:07.316
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT HARD
TO FIGURE OUT WHO I WAS

35:07.316 --> 35:08.777
OR WHERE I WORKED.

35:08.777 --> 35:09.898
AND THEN WHAT?
THEN WHAT?

35:09.898 --> 35:11.940
WHAT'D, YOU --
WHAT'D, YOU STALK ME?

35:11.940 --> 35:13.942
JUST LIKE YOU DID
ALL YOUR OTHER VICTIMS,

35:13.942 --> 35:15.154
WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT MOMENT?

35:15.154 --> 35:18.367
I MEAN, MY GOD, I EVEN --
I EVEN FIT YOUR PROFILE.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.409
YOU WERE
GONNA KILL ME.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.121
BUT YOU WEREN'T ABDUCTED,
DANIEL.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.544
NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO KIDNAP ME.

35:25.544 --> 35:27.166
I CAME TO YOU.

35:27.166 --> 35:30.299
B-BEFORE YOU COULD MAKE YOUR
MOVE, I HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAK.

35:30.299 --> 35:33.382
THE E.M.T.s TOOK ME
TO THE CLOSEST EMERGENCY ROOM

35:33.382 --> 35:35.174
AT COUNTY GENERAL.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.966
BUT THERE WERE NO BEDS AVAILABLE
IN THEIR PSYCH WARD.

35:37.966 --> 35:41.390
AND THEN, MAGICALLY,
ONE OPENED UP RIGHT HERE.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.101
RIGHT HERE AT REXFORD,

35:43.101 --> 35:45.974
A HOSPITAL
WHERE YOU HAD PRIVILEGES,

35:45.974 --> 35:50.529
AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE
THAT YOU WERE ASSIGNED MY CASE.

35:52.981 --> 35:55.153
IT SOUNDS LIKE
AN INGENIOUS PLAN.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.155
[ SCOFFS ]

35:57.155 --> 35:59.988
BUT THIS IS WHERE
YOUR DELUSION REVEALS ITSELF.

35:59.988 --> 36:03.952
IF I WERE
THIS PERSON YOU IMAGINE,

36:03.952 --> 36:05.994
THIS SERIAL KILLER,

36:05.994 --> 36:10.128
WHY WOULD I GO TO THE TROUBLE
TO TAKE YOU UNDER MY CARE?

36:10.128 --> 36:12.631
WHY WOULDN'T I
JUST KILL YOU?

36:12.631 --> 36:16.845
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

36:16.845 --> 36:18.427
MAYBE -- MAYBE ONCE YOU KNEW
MY DIAGNOSIS,

36:18.427 --> 36:20.008
ONCE YOU SAW
HOW CRAZY I WAS,

36:20.008 --> 36:21.470
YOU FIGURED I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE A THREAT.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.061
OR MAYBE --
MAYBE YOU THOUGHT

36:23.061 --> 36:25.354
IT'D BE AN INTERESTING
PROFESSIONAL CHALLENGE

36:25.354 --> 36:27.606
TO SEE IF YOU COULD -- IF YOU
COULD CURE ME OF MY DELUSION.

36:27.606 --> 36:30.859
THE ONE THING I DON'T GET --
HOW SOMEONE LIKE YOU,

36:30.859 --> 36:33.071
WHO'S DEDICATED HIS LIFE
TO THE MENTALLY ILL --

36:33.071 --> 36:37.025
COULD END UP HATING US SO MUCH
THAT YOU'D WANT TO KILL US.

36:37.025 --> 36:39.238
NO ONE KNOWS
BETTER THAN YOU HOW --

36:39.238 --> 36:40.619
HOW TERRIBLY OVERWHELMED

36:40.619 --> 36:43.452
THE MENTAL-HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS
IN THIS COUNTRY,

36:43.452 --> 36:47.085
HOW LITTLE MONEY
IS DEVOTED TO CLINICAL RESEARCH.

36:47.085 --> 36:50.038
SO MANY PEOPLE
FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS,

36:50.038 --> 36:54.883
AND THEY LEAD MISERABLE,
WRETCHED LIVES.

36:54.883 --> 36:57.886
SOME EVEN
TURN VIOLENT.

36:57.886 --> 37:01.219
ONE COULD
MAKE THE ARGUMENT

37:01.219 --> 37:04.893
THAT THESE SO-CALLED VICTIMS
ARE BETTER OFF.

37:04.893 --> 37:08.267
THAT'S WHY
YOU USED HEROIN.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.482
THESE WERE MERCY KILLINGS
TO YOU.

37:13.482 --> 37:16.154
DANIEL,
I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOU

37:16.154 --> 37:18.236
IT'S JUST
ANOTHER PARANOID DELUSION.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.320
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THEORY AND CONJECTURE.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.622
THERE ISN'T A SHRED OF EVIDENCE
TO BACK IT UP.

37:23.622 --> 37:27.536
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.499
YET.
BUT IT'S OUT THERE.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.080
IT'S OUT THERE,
JOSIAH.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.922
I'M -- I'M --
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT

37:33.922 --> 37:35.634
WHERE YOU PURCHASED
THAT HEROIN.

37:35.634 --> 37:38.297
OR I'M GONNA --
I'M GONNA LINK YOU TO THE S.U.V.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.048
YOU KNOW, MAYBE --
I-I-IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME

37:40.048 --> 37:41.300
TO FIND OUT THAT YOU --
THAT YOU HAVE PRIVILEGES

37:41.300 --> 37:43.091
AT COUNTY GENERAL,
TOO.

37:43.091 --> 37:45.514
MAYBE YOU WERE WORKING
IN THEIR PSYCH WARD THAT NIGHT

37:45.514 --> 37:47.145
WHEN LINDSAY CAME IN,

37:47.145 --> 37:49.728
BUT BECAUSE YOU HAD NO
BED FOR HER, BECAUSE
YOU FELT SORRY FOR HER,

37:49.728 --> 37:51.440
YOU FOLLOWED HER
OUT INTO THE STREET

37:51.440 --> 37:54.102

THEY'RE GONNA BELIEVE?

ATTACKED ME.

HE DIDN'T.

THE WHOLE THING.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.878
Daniel: ONE POPULAR DEFINITION
OF INSANITY

40:19.878 --> 40:23.301
IS DOING THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

40:23.301 --> 40:26.304
AND EXPECTING
A DIFFERENT OUTCOME.

40:26.304 --> 40:28.426
WHEN YOU BINGE-EAT
A PINT OF CHUNKY MONKEY,

40:28.426 --> 40:31.259
YOU SEE THE NEGATIVE RESULTS
WHEN YOU STEP ON THE SCALE.

SO, WHEN YOU GO TO THE FREEZER
TO GRAB ANOTHER ONE,

40:33.431 --> 40:37.265
YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE AND RESIST.

40:37.265 --> 40:38.687
BUT YOU DON'T.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.479
WHY?

40:40.479 --> 40:43.692
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FORGET
THE RUSH OF PLEASURE,

THE DOPAMINE THAT FLOODS

40:46.735 --> 40:49.488

FOR THE CLOSEST ONE.

DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR IS EASY.

BREAKING THOSE PATTERNS
IS HARD.

CAN WE AT LEAST RECOGNIZE
THE SYMPTOMS?

ADMIT OUR MISTAKES

41:09.467 --> 41:12.761
AND TRY TO TURN OVER
A NEW NEUROLOGICAL LEAF?

41:14.973 --> 41:20.398
IF THE PAST IS PROLOGUE, IS OUR
SCRIPT WRITTEN IN PERMANENT INK?

41:20.398 --> 41:22.731
CAN WE LEARN
FROM OUR HISTORY...

41:24.693 --> 41:26.735
OR ARE WE DOOMED
TO REPEAT IT?
