WEBVTT

00:00.915 --> 00:02.072
Charges of crookedness

00:02.096 --> 00:04.629
relating to last year's
world series are emerging.

00:04.747 --> 00:05.747
Speculation.

00:05.771 --> 00:07.903
The world series was
months ago, lawyer Fallon,

00:08.004 --> 00:09.812
and the horseshit
hasn't dried yet.

00:10.746 --> 00:12.917
Go wait in the car.

00:16.661 --> 00:18.593
Clifford: Why even put
Van Alden on the stand?

00:18.627 --> 00:20.307
He'll be handy for the
Volstead violations.

00:20.331 --> 00:21.451
We'll rehearse him on those.

00:21.665 --> 00:24.338
He's got Thompson ordering
12 homicides with no proof.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.409
Including his
mistress's husband.

00:26.443 --> 00:29.317
You and your friend Eli responded
to a domestic disturbance

00:29.351 --> 00:32.124
regarding a Hans Schroeder.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.727
Who?

00:33.761 --> 00:36.434
- Angela.
- Louise.

00:38.004 --> 00:40.475
- Call a strike.
- You sure this what you want?

00:40.509 --> 00:43.147
- Doesn't matter to me.
- Go on, give it to 'em.

00:43.181 --> 00:45.118
We want a raise.

00:46.321 --> 00:48.524
See how I'm moving your foot?
Now you do it.

00:48.558 --> 00:50.026
Are you trying?

00:51.664 --> 00:53.233
It's polio, isn't it?

00:53.267 --> 00:55.236
She has all the symptoms.

00:55.270 --> 00:56.553
Thompson sub machine guns.

00:56.577 --> 00:59.009
There are 3,000 sitting in
the Atlantic city armory.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.110
- And what do you want for them, Mr.
Thompson?

01:01.134 --> 01:04.184
- Irish whiskey... all I can get.
- I'll present it to the leadership.

01:04.519 --> 01:08.658
1,000 machine guns for
10,000 cases of whiskey.

01:08.692 --> 01:11.795
I understand you have
government-bonded whiskey to sell.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.565
Al: The five of us are
willin' to kick in

01:13.599 --> 01:16.303
- 60 grand a piece.
- Mickey: We do things right,

01:16.337 --> 01:18.706
- It'll be worth three million.
- Manny Horvitz.

01:18.741 --> 01:20.509
- Pay him - I'll
take care of it.

01:20.544 --> 01:24.782
You lost two men last month.
Manny did the shooting.

Preacher: From the book
of Deuteronomy, 24:14,

04:20.250 --> 04:24.219
"thou shall not oppress
a hired servant"

04:24.254 --> 04:26.488
who is poor and needy,

04:26.522 --> 04:28.790
whether he be of thy brethren,

04:28.824 --> 04:31.392
or of thy strangers
that are in thy land

04:31.426 --> 04:33.793
"within thy gates." Brothers,

04:33.827 --> 04:37.196
the lord knew that
fairness was not something

04:37.231 --> 04:39.698
to be parceled out
by those in power

04:39.733 --> 04:42.567
like so many crusts of bread!

04:42.602 --> 04:46.170
The lord knew that
decency and fairness

04:49.241 --> 04:52.444
to those who served
faithfully that they too

04:52.478 --> 04:55.146
- will be served in turn.
- Amen. - Amen!

04:55.181 --> 04:57.382
- (Shouting)
- So that the strong

04:57.449 --> 04:59.717
and the weak shall
know each other.

04:59.751 --> 05:02.252
Amen. And know the truth.

05:02.286 --> 05:05.154
That the strong
are not as mighty

05:05.189 --> 05:08.391
as they may think. And the weak...
have mercy...

05:08.425 --> 05:11.127
Not as feeble as
they may appear.

05:11.161 --> 05:14.597
The lord knew that civility

05:14.631 --> 05:17.266
was not just an accommodation.

05:17.300 --> 05:21.536
The lord knew, in his
infinite wisdom,

05:21.570 --> 05:24.303
that decency and fairness

05:24.337 --> 05:27.505
was a solemn Christian
duty to those...

05:27.540 --> 05:29.974
(Muffled shouting continues)

05:33.086 --> 05:35.052
Are you the man to see?

05:35.096 --> 05:37.830
Unless there's someone else in
here with his thumb in his ass.

05:38.498 --> 05:42.200
- Striker: We're not moving!
- Nucky Thompson sent me.

05:42.234 --> 05:45.769
I thought he hung 'em up.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.304
A man can't have a hobby?

05:48.339 --> 05:50.640
There's not a lot of call for
oats at the moment. (Scoffs)

05:50.674 --> 05:53.809
Strikers: We got children
at home we go to feed too!

05:59.547 --> 06:02.282
There where would those profit!
Fancy places be without us?

06:02.350 --> 06:05.885
- That real?
- Straight from the old girl's tit.

06:16.395 --> 06:19.463
Strikers: Y'all can afford
to pay us 10 cents more.

06:19.497 --> 06:23.599
$30 a case, it's less
than half the going rate.

06:23.634 --> 06:28.339
- We want fair wages!
- We work just as hard.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.210
- Who's gonna serve it?
- They'll be back.

06:33.245 --> 06:36.080
Are you an expert
on labor relations?

06:36.114 --> 06:39.349
I know what an empty
stomach feels like.

06:39.384 --> 06:42.618
Strikers: We're gonna stay out
here as long as it takes.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.222
Owen: Someday this
strike will end, sir.

06:46.256 --> 06:48.024
And so will our deal on this

06:48.058 --> 06:51.695
fine Irish whiskey.

06:51.730 --> 06:55.099
Strikers: We're gonna stay on
strike till they treat us fair.

06:55.133 --> 06:59.202
- We'll stay together...
- Get me 400 cases.

07:00.638 --> 07:03.907
(Wind chimes ringing,
distant dog barks)

07:07.445 --> 07:09.513
You seem quite at
home with this.

07:09.547 --> 07:13.416
Ja, being the oldest
of seven children,

07:13.450 --> 07:16.017
it's always been.

07:16.052 --> 07:18.386
My mother tells the story

07:18.420 --> 07:20.287
of how when I am six,

07:20.322 --> 07:22.489
I try to feed my baby sister

07:22.523 --> 07:24.691
through my bosom.

07:24.725 --> 07:27.460
I wish I had milk for you.

07:27.494 --> 07:30.196
- (Abigail coos)
- Ja, I do.

07:30.230 --> 07:33.499
Ja, I do.

07:33.533 --> 07:35.234
(Clears throat)

07:36.369 --> 07:38.704
There's some money
for groceries.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.610
Some shortbread cookies would...

07:45.147 --> 07:47.483
When did this me? Why
didn't I get this?

07:47.518 --> 07:50.286
Yesterday. I leave
it for you there.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.056
I am to receive all correspondence
from Mrs. Van Alden immediately.

07:54.091 --> 07:56.994
Ja. I... I thought you see it.

08:01.601 --> 08:04.236
(Abigail fussing)

08:06.105 --> 08:09.139
Oh, come on.

08:09.174 --> 08:11.541
(Abigail wailing)

08:11.575 --> 08:14.243
Shhh.

08:14.278 --> 08:17.679
Give the burp for to me.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.281
Shhh.

08:19.315 --> 08:21.416
- (Wailing continues)
- (Paper crumples)

08:21.451 --> 08:23.885
Shhh.

08:31.592 --> 08:33.626
Mrs. Schroeder.

08:33.660 --> 08:35.895
- Mr. Thompson.
- Dr. Holt

08:35.929 --> 08:39.232
It's nice to see you.
This is Theodore.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.299
- What do you say?
- How do you do, sir?

08:43.335 --> 08:45.268
How is she, doctor?

08:45.302 --> 08:48.103
Sleeping. Bit of
a rough patch...

08:48.138 --> 08:51.205
- Nausea and such.
- Why did no one ring me?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.206
I would've stayed the night.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.950
I know how hard this is for you,

08:54.974 --> 08:57.340
but she's in good hands here.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.952
She'll need your love
and patience later on.

08:59.976 --> 09:02.577
Later when?

09:05.246 --> 09:11.215
You can go on in if you'd like.

09:11.249 --> 09:13.583
Come on, slugger.
But very quiet.

09:13.617 --> 09:15.852
Little cat feet.

09:19.756 --> 09:21.924
Her lungs are sound.

09:21.959 --> 09:26.062
Nerves to the heart and upper
limbs seem unaffected.

09:26.096 --> 09:29.896
But the damage to her
legs could be extensive.

09:30.797 --> 09:32.664
Will she be crippled?

09:32.699 --> 09:34.632
At this stage it's
impossible to say.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.567
I've seen children

09:36.601 --> 09:38.768
worse than her make a
complete recovery.

09:40.136 --> 09:42.837
Mr. Thompson is a man of means.

09:42.872 --> 09:45.006
If there's anything
to be done...

09:45.040 --> 09:47.575
Wish it were as simple as money.

09:47.609 --> 09:51.276
The are things that are
out of our control,

09:51.310 --> 09:53.810
much as I want to
tell you otherwise.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.829
Little girl?

10:05.853 --> 10:07.920
She's nine.

10:07.955 --> 10:11.957
She says a prayer for
these kids every night.

10:11.991 --> 10:13.925
She doesn't know them.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.527
I never taught her to do it.

10:16.562 --> 10:19.730
You're meant to ask God
to intercede for other

10:21.366 --> 10:24.500
Holt: I've always found it
hard not to a for myself.

10:26.269 --> 10:27.736
We'll get the results

10:27.770 --> 10:30.237
from the latest test by Friday

10:30.271 --> 10:32.372
and have an answer then.

10:32.406 --> 10:35.374
Go in and see your daughter.

10:38.278 --> 10:40.611
Woman: Okay, dear, come on.

10:40.646 --> 10:43.914
Right leg first. There you go.

10:43.948 --> 10:47.016
Now isn't that getting easier?

10:47.050 --> 10:48.984
Good boy.

10:54.322 --> 10:57.056
Good morning, my darling.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.758
How are you feeling?

10:59.792 --> 11:02.927
- All right.
- We missed you so much.

11:02.961 --> 11:06.029
And look what I brought.

11:07.098 --> 11:09.698
What happened to miss Wheatley?

11:09.732 --> 11:12.567
This is miss Wheatley's sister.

11:12.601 --> 11:16.237
She's here to visit and she
insisted on seeing you.

11:17.638 --> 11:20.639
Here. Aww.

11:20.673 --> 11:24.008
Do you like her
lovely curly hair

11:24.042 --> 11:26.876
- Is it like yours?
- Nucky: Your hair's prettier.

11:26.911 --> 11:30.212
(Margaret chuckle)
She's very pretty.

11:30.246 --> 11:32.480
(Nucky imitates doll) Hi, Emy.

11:32.514 --> 11:34.648
Margaret: See her lovely bow?

11:34.682 --> 11:36.682
How nice.

11:36.717 --> 11:39.084
(Music playing)

11:40.119 --> 11:42.754
Man: Hey, bring it over here!

11:42.788 --> 11:45.923
Man ♪2: Harvey, that box?
Step on it.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.268
Jesus. Easy.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.436
We're not making popskull here.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.952
Hiya, boys. Checking
up on your investment?

12:08.976 --> 12:10.477
Yeah, try not to
lose this batch.

12:10.511 --> 12:12.646
(Mickey giggles)

12:12.680 --> 12:15.748
"Property of the U.S.
government."

12:15.782 --> 12:17.416
Not anymore, it ain't.

12:19.984 --> 12:22.918
- To George Remus.
- (Al cackles)

12:22.952 --> 12:25.886
- So how long?
- We're halfway done.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.920
A week around the clock
will take care of the rest.

12:27.944 --> 12:28.866
That's too long.

12:28.890 --> 12:31.391
- I just got the 10 guys.
- Hire 50.

12:31.425 --> 12:33.265
You got those spooks
marching on the boardwalk,

12:33.360 --> 12:35.260
- pinch a few of them.
- Chalky will love that.

12:35.295 --> 12:38.196
- I didn't say ask his permission.
- I gotta unload this stuff,

12:38.231 --> 12:40.865
get home. Fuckin'
Torrio's on my ass

12:40.900 --> 12:44.269
Rothstein's sniffing around too.
He knows something's up.

12:44.304 --> 12:46.138
Yeah, we all got
business, right?

12:46.172 --> 12:48.532
- Mickey: There's Manny Horvitz too.
- Yeah, what about him?

12:48.556 --> 12:50.876
He's running a special on
lips and assholes this week.

12:50.910 --> 12:53.078
- What do you think?
- Fuckin' pay him already.

12:53.113 --> 12:55.648
- Cash?
- Booze, whatever.

12:55.682 --> 12:58.958
He's Waxey Gordon's
problem now, not mine.

13:04.293 --> 13:06.794
Luciano: Darmody, hold up

13:06.829 --> 13:09.364
I been wanting to
show you something.

13:11.534 --> 13:14.301
What are youse looking at?
Get back to work.

13:16.439 --> 13:19.641
You can sniff it, smoke
it or inject it.

13:19.742 --> 13:21.974
Nice, Sal. You moving
chink drugs now?

13:22.075 --> 13:23.909
It ain't hop, it's heroin.

13:23.944 --> 13:26.446
And I wouldn't think a
whoremeister'd pass judgment.

13:26.481 --> 13:29.484
- (Chuckles) - Meyer: Heroin
delivers a higher dose of opiates

13:29.518 --> 13:32.621
to the brain than opium... which
makes for a happier customer.

13:32.655 --> 13:34.590
No bottles, no barrels.

13:34.624 --> 13:37.192
A million bucks in a suitcase.

13:37.227 --> 13:38.895
- What's the bank?
- Huh?

13:38.929 --> 13:41.931
- Who's gonna buy it?
- You got your artist types,

13:41.965 --> 13:44.933
- people uptown. I seen this one...
- How many?

13:44.968 --> 13:47.302
Their numbers may be
very small right now,

13:47.336 --> 13:49.572
but they're very enthusiastic.

13:49.606 --> 13:51.741
Here... get a few samples
out to the local

13:51.775 --> 13:55.012
All right, that's great. But
before you start squawking again,

13:55.047 --> 13:57.348
how about getting
this out the locals?

14:01.685 --> 14:03.619
I don't know what
tell you, Nucky.

14:03.654 --> 14:05.588
I'm extremely disappointed.

14:05.623 --> 14:07.490
Okay, try that again.

14:07.524 --> 14:09.192
Only this time
leave out the part

14:09.226 --> 14:10.826
where you sound like my mother.

14:10.861 --> 14:14.363
This Esther Randolph,
she's relentless.

14:14.397 --> 14:17.732
The trial will be in Camden.
I've made calls...

14:17.766 --> 14:19.801
You've made calls?

14:21.103 --> 14:23.438
Worth every penny.

14:23.472 --> 14:26.750
- Daugherty?
- Says he did what he could;

14:26.774 --> 14:29.943
- that you two are square.
- Your desk ready for use.

14:29.977 --> 14:34.178
You hear that, Nicky? My desk
which used to be in my suite

14:34.212 --> 14:36.915
when I ran the fucking city...
Is ready for use.

14:36.949 --> 14:39.384
- Is there gonna be anything else?
- No.

14:41.187 --> 14:43.888
- Thank you, Harlan.
- Mr. Thompson.

14:48.159 --> 14:50.394
Now why don't you tell
me what you have in mind

14:50.428 --> 14:52.541
to keep this trial
in Atlantic county,

14:52.565 --> 14:54.464
where I can work the
judge and jury?

14:54.565 --> 14:56.399
Medical hardship.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.234
You mean this?

14:59.268 --> 15:01.426
This wouldn't even stop
me from jacking off!

15:01.470 --> 15:03.738
You'll get five years.
You'll be out in two...

15:03.772 --> 15:04.772
Eddie!

15:04.907 --> 15:07.575
Call those two Guinea
anarchists from Massachusetts.

15:07.609 --> 15:10.110
Tell them to relax, I've
found them a new lawyer.

15:10.145 --> 15:11.712
The difference being

15:11.746 --> 15:14.280
with Sacco and Vanzetti

15:14.315 --> 15:17.350
that innocence is
still a possibility.

15:19.153 --> 15:21.954
- Did you want something?
- Get the fuck out.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.360
- I was talking to you.
- I realize that.

15:29.394 --> 15:33.230
Good. Then you should also
realize you're fired.

15:34.432 --> 15:36.199
(Sighs)

16:01.819 --> 16:04.153
300 empty rooms,

16:04.188 --> 16:06.822
500 pounds of peaches
darker than the help

16:06.857 --> 16:09.792
and a tourist season that's
slipping through my fingers.

16:09.826 --> 16:11.826
And why? Because no one here

16:11.861 --> 16:13.905
can get the colored
situation under control.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.563
It should've been dealt
with a month ago.

16:15.631 --> 16:17.831
Like your father dealt
with Chalky White.

16:17.866 --> 16:19.178
I don't want to owe
the klan on this one.

16:19.202 --> 16:20.312
They got the job done.

16:20.336 --> 16:22.204
You do you think we're
this mess to begin with?

16:22.238 --> 16:24.278
Man: Because these jigaboos
all think they're Moses.

16:24.302 --> 16:25.841
Half them are named at away.

16:25.876 --> 16:27.810
(Mumbling) No no.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.778
- No!
- Jimmy: It's all right.

16:29.813 --> 16:32.648
- Don't get worked up.
- He's trying to speak.

16:32.682 --> 16:35.584
- God damn it. The...
- I'll take care of it.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.321
Okay, pop?

16:38.355 --> 16:40.323
Yes?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.492
- You're going to negotiate.
- What?

16:43.527 --> 16:45.561
- Settle it, get back to business.
- Ed!

16:45.596 --> 16:48.030
- Hear him out, Dan.
- Nickel raise across the board.

16:48.065 --> 16:51.432
- Are you saying you can't afford it?
- Nobody ever does that, kid.

16:51.466 --> 16:53.500
It's nothing compared
to what you're losing.

16:53.535 --> 16:55.502
And next year? The
year after that?

16:55.536 --> 16:56.748
Where will it end?

16:56.772 --> 16:59.604
Memorial Day, people come;
Labor day, people go.

16:59.705 --> 17:01.018
That's what we've got.

17:01.042 --> 17:02.351
That's where we make money.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.643
- We give in to them now...
- No! No.

17:05.777 --> 17:09.345
- (Commodore stammers)
- Gentlemen, my father needs to rest

17:09.378 --> 17:11.246
- Please.
- Jimmy...

17:11.281 --> 17:14.015
(Stammering continues)

17:21.119 --> 17:22.820
Do what we're
paying you to do...

17:22.855 --> 17:24.954
End this.

17:33.997 --> 17:36.198
I think you're handling
this in the right way

17:36.232 --> 17:38.166
No, you don't.

17:41.871 --> 17:44.105
50 guys with billy clubs.

17:44.139 --> 17:46.640
- Neary: That's the ticket.
- Are you serious?

17:46.675 --> 17:48.675
How do you think these
things get handled?

17:48.710 --> 17:51.444
Look what happened back in '09...
the steeplecase?

17:51.479 --> 17:52.912
Tossed 'em straight
off the pier.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.147
"Look, mammy, I
swimming!" (Laughs)

17:55.182 --> 17:57.262
- I'm not starting a riot.
- Eli: There won't be one.

17:57.286 --> 18:00.018
They're in, they're out; Shines
get something to chew on.

18:00.052 --> 18:02.954
- Right, commodore?
- Neary: Who's your man out there?

18:02.988 --> 18:05.733
- Halloran's on it.
- Neary: Old raging Ray?

18:05.757 --> 18:07.791
What's that mean?

18:07.826 --> 18:09.926
Nothing. I had another
heart-to-heart Ray?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.827
With our lovely lady
lawyer last week,

18:11.862 --> 18:14.263
saw him sitting out there
with his guts in a knot.

18:14.297 --> 18:16.176
- I told him not to talk to her.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.400
"I tell him," Ray, whatever
she asks about the election,

18:18.424 --> 18:21.668
just say Nucky made you do it.
Take your lollipop and go home."

18:21.703 --> 18:23.837
- Sure, that's how you swing it.
- Neary: Jeez.

18:23.871 --> 18:25.572
Some people, huh?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.872
You're intending to
follow this strategy?

18:28.942 --> 18:29.419
Which one?

18:29.443 --> 18:31.620
The billy clubs or
throwing them at the pier?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.344
I can't choose.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.656
Your predecessor knew how
to keep the colored happy.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.780
All right. This is what we got.
I'm not Nucky, ok?

18:38.850 --> 18:40.170
Now at we got that
out of the way,

18:40.194 --> 18:42.587
let's figure how to
end this peaceful...

18:42.624 --> 18:44.258
Why don't you

18:44.558 --> 18:48.058
just show 'em your cunt?

18:52.396 --> 18:54.631
What?

19:02.872 --> 19:05.273
You heard me.

19:05.307 --> 19:07.607
Why don't you just...

19:07.642 --> 19:09.509
Lift up your dress

19:09.543 --> 19:12.244
and let yourself get fucked?

19:18.784 --> 19:22.486
- Get me a fucking drink.
- Yes sir, commodore.

19:27.591 --> 19:30.126
Teddy: When I lay down to sleep,

19:30.160 --> 19:33.195
I pray the lord my soul to keep.

19:33.229 --> 19:35.897
If I should die before I wake,

19:35.931 --> 19:39.167
pray the lord my soul to take.

19:42.737 --> 19:45.505
Shall we say a special
prayer for Emily?

19:51.645 --> 19:55.113
And please make my
sister Emily get better.

20:02.688 --> 20:05.055
Good night, sweet prince.

20:10.127 --> 20:13.029
- Mama?
- Yes dear?

20:13.063 --> 20:16.031
I can't move my legs.

20:16.066 --> 20:17.599
What?

20:17.633 --> 20:19.000
I can't move my...

20:20.536 --> 20:23.404
- Can you feel that?!
- No.

20:26.241 --> 20:28.575
(Giggling)

20:36.381 --> 20:39.082
(Wailing)

20:42.185 --> 20:44.385
You were just praying.

20:56.163 --> 20:58.864
(Crying continues)

21:09.176 --> 21:13.279
God help me, but he's got
his father's cruelty.

21:13.313 --> 21:16.114
He just wants attention.

21:16.149 --> 21:19.117
His sister's lying
crippled in the hospital.

21:19.152 --> 21:21.720
He knows that.

21:21.754 --> 21:23.889
Not the same as understanding.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.359
What am I to do?

21:27.394 --> 21:31.629
Abandon my sick baby girl
to attend my healthy son?

21:31.664 --> 21:35.533
Before anything else you're to
stop running yourself ragged.

21:43.541 --> 21:45.742
I have to be in New
York tomorrow.

21:45.943 --> 21:47.252
Just for the day.

21:47.276 --> 21:49.211
I'll take Teddy with me.

21:49.545 --> 21:51.713
It'll give you a chance to rest.

21:51.747 --> 21:54.448
What will you be doing there?

21:54.483 --> 21:57.184
Hiring a new lawyer.

21:59.487 --> 22:03.289
- You can't leave him alone.
- I won't.

22:04.725 --> 22:07.536
And please see that
he brushes his teeth.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.328
Okay.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.364
And make sure that he keeps
his fingers from his nose.

22:12.398 --> 22:15.199

23:35.138 --> 23:38.103
Mr. Thompson. I've heard
only good things.

23:38.137 --> 23:40.536
Not from me, of course.

23:40.570 --> 23:44.138
Well, at certainly narrows
down the list of suspects.

23:45.374 --> 23:47.841
- You like baseball?
- Yes.

23:48.977 --> 23:51.778
Ty Cobb signed this.
Now it's yours.

23:52.946 --> 23:54.713
What do you say, Teddy?

23:54.748 --> 23:58.650
Ty Cobb is a bad man.

23:58.684 --> 24:01.486
He doesn't like to be
crossed, at for sure.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.955
But if your team's down, he's
the guy you want at bat.

24:04.990 --> 24:07.391
Now go on, kiddo.

24:11.661 --> 24:14.463
Come on, Teddy. How about
a nice glass of milk?

24:19.903 --> 24:22.605
So your case...

24:22.639 --> 24:25.174
Arnold tells me you'd like
to go in a new direction.

24:25.208 --> 24:28.109
Preferably away from jail.

24:28.143 --> 24:31.211
This Ginsburg you had
defending you...

24:31.279 --> 24:33.812
he's lost his main focus

24:33.847 --> 24:36.414
or something he does when
he's not shoeing horses?

24:37.549 --> 24:39.050
I hope the meter's not running.

24:39.084 --> 24:41.519
I'd hate to think I'm paying
to hear what fool I am.

24:41.553 --> 24:43.754
That part's on the house.

24:46.157 --> 24:48.269
Once you get past Mr.
Fallon's charm,

24:48.293 --> 24:50.959
I think you'd find
him quite effective.

24:50.994 --> 24:54.729
Can you get the venue changed
back to Atlantic City?

24:54.764 --> 24:56.674
Probably not. But if there's

24:56.698 --> 24:59.166
a seed of dot to be
sown on your behalf,

24:59.200 --> 25:01.134
I am quite effective
with juries.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.636
And all this farming
will set me back what?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.537
$80 per hour.

25:05.572 --> 25:09.807
Which also buys you my uncanny
ability to make friends with judges.

25:12.143 --> 25:15.379
And if I told you I had
no money for bribes?

25:15.414 --> 25:18.883
Then you'd be relying
solely on my legal acumen.

25:25.523 --> 25:28.023
What would you do, Arnold?

25:35.064 --> 25:38.065
No one likes a long shot
more than a gambler.

25:46.974 --> 25:49.742
(Distant traffic, music playing)

25:53.781 --> 25:57.016
- (Knocks - (Mumbling) Come in.

26:00.253 --> 26:01.953
Eli.

26:14.631 --> 26:16.897
Fresh peas,

26:16.932 --> 26:19.410
from June's garden.

26:19.434 --> 26:22.335
What do I do with them?

26:23.470 --> 26:25.504
Have your landlady boil 'em up.

26:27.141 --> 26:29.874
- How you feeling?
- How do you think?

26:30.308 --> 26:33.676
Yeah. What happened out there?

26:33.711 --> 26:36.756
Two of 'em came up behind me.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.213
Sons of bitches.

26:40.315 --> 26:43.584
I was standing off
by the railings.

26:43.618 --> 26:45.885
What we're gonna do,

26:45.919 --> 26:47.787
you're back on your feet,

26:47.821 --> 26:51.023
we drive around the northside, you
point out these black bastards.

26:51.058 --> 26:53.659
They weren't dinges, Eli.

26:55.427 --> 26:58.228
They were the breakers. I mean

26:58.263 --> 27:01.296
normal white men!

27:02.865 --> 27:05.999
- Really?
- I couldn't believe it.

27:06.034 --> 27:07.834
They think you
were someone else?

27:07.868 --> 27:10.669
Who else would I be?
I'm wearing the brown.

27:10.703 --> 27:14.071
- (Whimpers)
- Well, there's a puzzlement.

27:15.107 --> 27:19.309
You get me. I can
hardly fucking talk.

27:19.343 --> 27:23.813
Well, it ain't like you got anything
else you wanna say, is there?

27:30.086 --> 27:33.857
What I think, Ray, when
things go wrong...

27:35.829 --> 27:38.266
"What did I do?

27:38.300 --> 27:40.870
Why do I deserve this?"

27:42.139 --> 27:44.306
I don't deserve it.

27:49.411 --> 27:51.579
My philosophy...
it goes in here,

27:51.614 --> 27:53.381
it comes out somewhere else.

27:53.416 --> 27:55.650
God?

27:55.684 --> 27:57.619
Fate?

27:57.653 --> 28:00.121
I don't know what you call it.

28:01.990 --> 28:04.523
"What did I do?"

28:06.493 --> 28:09.794
What should I make sure

28:09.829 --> 28:12.063
I never...

28:12.097 --> 28:15.099
ever...

28:15.133 --> 28:17.734
"do again?"

28:19.369 --> 28:22.236
Good time to reflect about it.

28:29.143 --> 28:32.846
Butter, salt... delicious.

28:56.337 --> 28:58.304
(Whimpers)

29:04.075 --> 29:06.510
Get me the post office

29:06.544 --> 29:09.379
over on Illinois.

29:21.291 --> 29:23.459
(Coins jingle)

29:30.830 --> 29:32.763
Mrs. Schroeder.

29:34.499 --> 29:36.400
Father.

29:36.434 --> 29:39.135
Is something wrong?

29:41.338 --> 29:43.639
My youngest...

29:43.673 --> 29:45.807
Emily,

29:45.842 --> 29:48.009
she has polio.

29:49.911 --> 29:51.812
I'm sorry.

29:51.846 --> 29:55.247
She's frightened, father.

29:55.282 --> 29:58.317
It's killing me.

30:06.359 --> 30:08.793
God is with her, my child.

30:10.228 --> 30:12.930
As he was when he let it happen.

30:14.232 --> 30:17.602
There are things I tell children, Mrs.
Schroeder,

30:17.636 --> 30:20.704
because that's all
they can grasp.

30:21.973 --> 30:23.807
You're an adult

30:23.841 --> 30:27.276
and you came here in your need.

30:27.311 --> 30:29.812
I've nowhere else to turn.

30:33.316 --> 30:36.684
You confessed something
to me not long ago

30:38.020 --> 30:39.987
about temptation.

30:40.021 --> 30:42.222
Is that still a burden?

30:44.125 --> 30:47.260
I'd rather not discuss that.

30:47.294 --> 30:49.161
Don't you see the problem?

30:49.195 --> 30:53.899
You ask of God, but what
do you offer in return?

30:55.434 --> 30:57.135
My devotion.

30:57.169 --> 31:00.204
Devotion is an act, Mrs.
Schroeder.

31:00.239 --> 31:02.873
It's something you demonstrate.

31:03.808 --> 31:06.743
How?

31:06.778 --> 31:08.778
That is for you to decide.

31:27.996 --> 31:30.631
(Door opens)

31:33.599 --> 31:36.934
- Mr. White.
- Young James.

31:40.004 --> 31:42.138
How Nucky shoes be
fittin' these days?

31:42.173 --> 31:45.541
- A little tighter than I expected.
- Hmph.

31:45.576 --> 31:48.243
Need some breakin' in, that all.

31:50.046 --> 31:52.246
So what can I do for y'all?

31:52.280 --> 31:54.748
This strike...

31:56.217 --> 31:58.284
It needs to end.

31:59.586 --> 32:01.754
I came here to
work something out

32:01.788 --> 32:04.390
Oh! Now y'all come.

32:04.425 --> 32:08.360
What you think about that, Mr.
Purnsley?

32:08.395 --> 32:10.228
I think that ball
team he sent round

32:10.263 --> 32:13.164
swingin' them bats struck out.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.766
It wasn't my idea, Chalky.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.335
Anthem klan boys shoot
up my warehouse?

32:18.370 --> 32:20.137
Not my idea either.

32:20.171 --> 32:23.506
Jesus, boy, ain't you
got any notion at all?

32:23.541 --> 32:26.108
Yeah.

32:29.245 --> 32:32.080
A plan to make your
murder charge go away.

32:32.214 --> 32:34.249
(Snorts)

32:34.283 --> 32:36.083
How you gonna do that?

32:36.118 --> 32:38.519
I'll talk to the governor.

32:46.292 --> 32:48.593
What else you got?

32:48.627 --> 32:52.162
- What else you want?
- Justice.

32:52.196 --> 32:53.743
Meaning what?

32:53.767 --> 32:55.499
The families of my men
that got killed...

32:55.900 --> 32:58.035
$3,000 a piece.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.472
Okay.

33:03.708 --> 33:07.244
And them three hooded
crackers did the shootin'?

33:07.278 --> 33:10.213
I want them delivered
to me personally.

33:20.254 --> 33:23.056
That's not gonna happen, Chalky.

33:29.198 --> 33:32.600
Well, buck, that's the deal.

33:32.634 --> 33:35.969
Always be next tourist
season, right?

33:44.211 --> 33:46.645
I will.

33:48.147 --> 33:50.782
I will.

33:50.816 --> 33:53.317
Okay, mama.

33:55.453 --> 33:57.754
I got a signed baseball.

33:57.789 --> 33:59.956
Ty Cobb.

33:59.990 --> 34:02.925
Okay, champ, time
to say good night.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.560
Good night, mama.

34:09.465 --> 34:11.732
We'll see you tomorrow.

34:11.766 --> 34:15.368
He is a very famous ballplayer.

34:17.004 --> 34:19.237
Good night, darling.

34:23.976 --> 34:26.077
Your mom sounded in
good spirits, eh?

34:34.886 --> 34:38.420
You know, I had a kid sister.

34:39.422 --> 34:41.690
Her name was Susan.

34:41.725 --> 34:43.525
She was sick too.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.293
Consumption.

34:47.597 --> 34:50.498
And my mother... just like
your mother with Emily...

34:50.532 --> 34:53.467
She spent every waking
moment taking care of her.

34:53.501 --> 34:56.168
And my brother and I would
get pretty jealous.

34:56.203 --> 34:58.338
- You did?
- Sure.

34:58.372 --> 35:00.439
Who wouldn't want
all that attention?

35:00.474 --> 35:04.610
But the thing is, we knew our
mother loved us just the same.

35:05.845 --> 35:07.612
How about your dad?

35:10.482 --> 35:12.516
Sure, of course.

35:12.550 --> 35:15.318
He loved us too.

35:22.659 --> 35:24.626
(Sighs)

35:25.561 --> 35:27.795
Are you in trouble?

35:29.864 --> 35:32.100
No.

35:32.135 --> 35:34.702
Well, a little.

35:35.971 --> 35:38.405
Some people said I
did something wrong,

35:38.440 --> 35:40.274
but it's not true.

35:42.276 --> 35:44.344
That you burned your
dad's house down?

35:47.014 --> 35:49.148
What?

35:49.182 --> 35:51.550
No.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.451
What makes you think that?

35:54.353 --> 35:56.654
I saw you.

35:58.057 --> 36:00.057
No, Teddy.

36:00.092 --> 36:02.593
What you saw...

36:02.627 --> 36:04.662
That was an accident.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.466
Don't worry, dad. I won't tell.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.674
Mickey: Look, I wash
my hands of this.

36:18.709 --> 36:21.077
Meyer: And this is just...
It just happened now?

36:21.111 --> 36:22.890
Yeah, it just happened today.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.323
I don't know where
it all came from.

36:24.347 --> 36:27.149
- This is unbelievable.
- Don't look at me. I just make it.

36:27.184 --> 36:28.884
- How'd you do?
- I didn't sell a drop.

36:28.919 --> 36:31.287
- The whole city's fuckin' drenched.
- Irish whiskey.

36:31.321 --> 36:32.766
Better and cheaper than
what we're sellin'.

36:32.790 --> 36:33.699
It's way cheaper.

36:33.723 --> 36:34.935
Well, who's behind it then?

36:34.959 --> 36:35.868
Nucky.

36:35.892 --> 36:38.894
- You know that?
- In my bones.

36:38.928 --> 36:40.596
So much for steppin' down.

36:40.630 --> 36:43.675
There's a reason why you cut
a snake's head clean off.

36:43.699 --> 36:45.109
Who screwed that up, Al?

36:45.133 --> 36:46.833
But this whiskey,
where's it from?

36:46.867 --> 36:48.747
You said you had the coast
guard in your pocket.

36:48.771 --> 36:50.731
- He says a lot of things.
- Richard: Nucky's man.

36:50.755 --> 36:52.938
He's from Ireland.
They imported it.

36:52.972 --> 36:55.406
So let's pop the fuckin' mick!

36:55.441 --> 36:58.041
That's great for tomorrow.
What do we do today?

36:58.076 --> 36:59.453
I thought you was
runnin' this town.

36:59.477 --> 37:00.187
Yeah, that's right.

37:00.211 --> 37:02.244
Ye? So you're supposed to
be givin' us the answers!

37:02.279 --> 37:04.379
Niggers on strike,
now this shit.

37:04.414 --> 37:07.281
They're still out there, you know.
More of 'em than ever now.

37:07.315 --> 37:08.349
Yeah, I know, Mickey.

37:08.383 --> 37:10.951
So this stuff could be
sittin' here for months.

37:10.985 --> 37:13.420
I said I would take care
of it, God damn it!

37:13.454 --> 37:15.189
Yeah? You should put
that to fucking music.

37:15.223 --> 37:16.701
You know what? Fuck you, Sal.

37:16.725 --> 37:18.958
Or Charlie or whatever
the fuck your name is.

37:19.159 --> 37:22.227
- It's Charlie.
- Is that the issue?!

37:22.962 --> 37:24.963
There's a fortune at
stake, gentlemen.

37:25.098 --> 37:29.833
- This alcohol needs to be sold.
- Yeah, thanks, genius.

37:29.867 --> 37:32.469
- Where?
- I propose

37:32.503 --> 37:35.372
we split up and sell it
in our respective towns.

37:35.406 --> 37:38.740
- This is my town.
- What?

37:38.775 --> 37:41.509
- I said this is my town!
- Philly then.

37:41.543 --> 37:43.511
I wouldn't go there
if I was you.

37:44.646 --> 37:46.880
On account of Manny Horvitz?

37:49.483 --> 37:51.918
All right.

37:51.952 --> 37:55.855
You take Philly.
I'll head north.

37:58.524 --> 38:00.058
Pfft.

38:05.530 --> 38:08.531
Look, let's just sell this shit.

38:08.566 --> 38:10.666
All right?

38:18.675 --> 38:22.276
At which point Enoch Thompson
left the premises with Mr. White.

38:22.311 --> 38:24.679
Randolph: Albert White,
known as "Chalky"?

38:24.713 --> 38:27.347
- That's correct.
- Randolph: Please tell the jury

38:27.382 --> 38:28.892
what happened next.

38:28.916 --> 38:31.918
Presumably they concluded
their deal for the alcohol.

38:31.952 --> 38:33.686
- Certainly I...
- Man: Objection!

38:35.388 --> 38:37.923
Your presumptions,
scintillating though they be,

38:37.957 --> 38:39.457
do not help us. You
are testifying

38:39.492 --> 38:42.326
as to direct knowledge of
Thompson's bootlegging.

38:43.195 --> 38:46.931
- I apologize.
- Just stick to what you know.

38:50.468 --> 38:53.636
Agent Van Alden, what can you
tell us about a Hans Schroeder?

38:55.238 --> 38:58.040
- I beg your pardon?
- Hans Schroeder.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.842
His name is mentioned in
your file quite extensively,

39:00.876 --> 39:02.810
as is his widow's.

39:02.845 --> 39:05.446
Are you baiting me,
miss Randolph?

39:05.480 --> 39:08.181
I'm sure I don't
know what you mean.

39:08.216 --> 39:10.517
In your file it says that

39:10.551 --> 39:12.986
Nucky Thompson ordered
Schroeder murdered.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.754
I have no direct proof of that.

39:14.789 --> 39:17.156
Well, you certainly spent
enough time on it.

39:17.190 --> 39:19.291
It was a theory.

39:19.325 --> 39:22.627
I was told by my supervisor
to focus on alcohol,

39:22.661 --> 39:24.962
as you've directed yourself

39:24.996 --> 39:26.964
in regard to my testimony.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.435
- Off the record?
- Yes?

39:32.470 --> 39:34.971
You think he did it.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.105
Thompson,

39:36.139 --> 39:38.607
ordering Schroeder's murder.

39:40.176 --> 39:43.311
I have no doubt whatsoever.

39:46.081 --> 39:48.982
Let's break for lunch, shall we?

39:55.355 --> 39:58.456
What do you think?
Do we have enough?

40:01.093 --> 40:03.127
Let's bring him in.

40:05.830 --> 40:08.264
(Knocks)

40:12.301 --> 40:14.702
(Knocks)

40:17.806 --> 40:19.939
(Knocks)

40:30.013 --> 40:31.746
Mickey: Munya!

40:31.780 --> 40:34.015
Mr. Doyle.

40:42.723 --> 40:45.458
Oh. What, are you kiddin'?

40:47.028 --> 40:50.063
Better safe than sorry. Sit.

40:54.468 --> 40:56.102
Not there.

40:56.136 --> 40:58.404
My wife will kill me.

40:58.439 --> 41:01.007
(Both chuckle)

41:05.745 --> 41:08.447
So...

41:08.481 --> 41:11.249
The two of us, eh?

41:11.283 --> 41:14.318
The walking wounded,

41:14.352 --> 41:16.120
courtesy of Mr. Darmody.

41:16.154 --> 41:19.622
- I don't follow.
- My shoulder,

41:19.657 --> 41:21.057
your neck.

41:21.092 --> 41:23.026
Jimmy ain't had nothing
to do with that.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.228
You landed at my feet.

41:25.263 --> 41:28.797
Your shoulder, I mean. That
was Waxey all the way.

41:40.609 --> 41:42.743
What have you brought me?

41:42.811 --> 41:44.845
Mmm.

41:44.879 --> 41:46.413
(Giggles)

41:46.447 --> 41:49.783
I'll give you five grand's
worth, to settle Jimmy's debt.

41:52.486 --> 41:55.554
- This is from Darmody?
- Sure. Like I said.

41:55.588 --> 41:58.690
Hmm, and yet he doesn't
bring it himself.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.392
- He's busy, munya.
- Yes.

42:00.426 --> 42:03.261
- (Pops)
- He's a macher now...

42:04.330 --> 42:06.497
who sends you to do his bidding.

42:27.749 --> 42:30.184
- Somethin' in my teeth?
- I took that

42:30.218 --> 42:33.486
from the man who
tried to kill me.

42:33.521 --> 42:36.856
Heilig's chop house.

42:36.890 --> 42:39.291
- So?
- (Buckshot chinks)

42:39.325 --> 42:42.427
(Groans)

42:42.461 --> 42:45.830
Atlantic City...

42:45.864 --> 42:48.231
Mr. Darmody's town.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.933
Munya, he...

42:49.967 --> 42:52.668
He tries to kill me and fails.

42:52.703 --> 42:55.837
And now he sends $5,000
worth of piss water

42:55.872 --> 42:58.206
- to get out of it.
- He's paying his debt is all.

42:59.675 --> 43:01.976
"He who dies

43:02.010 --> 43:04.044
pays all his debts."

43:04.079 --> 43:05.812
Hmm, the Bible, right?

43:05.847 --> 43:09.015
Lotta wisdom there.

43:09.049 --> 43:11.817
Look, you're still in
business, ain't cha?

43:11.851 --> 43:14.186
And you don't have
to deal with him

43:14.220 --> 43:17.322
ever. Just me.

43:18.324 --> 43:20.691
Eh...

43:20.726 --> 43:23.828
I take the payback.

43:23.896 --> 43:26.196
My old pal munya. (Giggles)

43:27.231 --> 43:29.232
(Grunts)

43:29.266 --> 43:32.334
And you tell me where I find Mr.
Darmody

43:32.369 --> 43:34.670
for a quiet chat.

43:34.704 --> 43:37.205
Manny,

43:37.239 --> 43:39.440
we're partners, me and him.

43:39.475 --> 43:42.109
I got an investment to protect.

43:44.779 --> 43:46.680
(Gagging)

43:46.714 --> 43:48.715
What the hell are you doing?

43:48.750 --> 43:50.550
Changing your mind.

43:50.585 --> 43:52.853
(Whimpering)

44:08.999 --> 44:11.733
Sheriff Thompson, good morning.

44:11.768 --> 44:14.135
I asked for a lawyer.

44:14.170 --> 44:17.071
I am a lawyer, just not yours.

44:17.105 --> 44:19.039
Esther Randolph.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.740
I'm an assistant U.S. attorney.

44:20.775 --> 44:23.409
At my house you come arrest me?

44:23.444 --> 44:26.645
Sorry, sheriff, but my
professional courtesies

44:26.680 --> 44:29.415
don't extend to murder suspects.

44:31.284 --> 44:33.485
You're grasping at straws, lady.

44:33.519 --> 44:36.387
Actually I think I've got one.

44:37.757 --> 44:41.425
Your deputy... Raymond Halloran?

44:43.361 --> 44:46.963
He's got a lot to say about you
and a man named Hans Schroeder.

44:48.465 --> 44:51.133
And if you've got
anything to say...

44:51.168 --> 44:53.635
About your brother
for instance...

44:53.669 --> 44:56.737
Please have your
lawyer get in touch.

44:57.873 --> 45:00.007
I'm sure he'll be
along any minute.

45:08.248 --> 45:11.417
(Door clanks)

45:11.451 --> 45:14.586
(Music playing)

45:58.724 --> 46:01.192
(Music continues)

46:06.897 --> 46:10.566
- (Knocks)
- Sorry to bother you, father.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.868
A Mrs. Schroeder to see you?

46:12.902 --> 46:15.203
- What does she want?
- She didn't say.

46:15.238 --> 46:17.571
Should I ask?

46:24.345 --> 46:26.312
Show her in.

46:38.190 --> 46:40.124
I'm disturbing you.

46:40.159 --> 46:41.992
Not at all, Mrs. Schroeder.

46:42.027 --> 46:43.661
Please, sit.

46:50.368 --> 46:52.669
They can very easily
get out of order,

46:52.703 --> 46:54.904
then there's no finding them.

47:02.678 --> 47:04.612
How is your little one?

47:04.647 --> 47:08.415
The doctor's reluctant
to make any predictions.

47:08.450 --> 47:10.584
Doesn't wish to give
you false hope.

47:10.618 --> 47:13.219
Would that be so bad?

47:13.254 --> 47:16.522
It would at least be
something for now.

47:16.556 --> 47:19.558
Wouldn't you rather believe
in something real?

47:19.592 --> 47:22.393
I want to believe
she'll recover.

47:26.965 --> 47:29.433
- Are you looking for a miracle?
- Yes. I am.

47:29.467 --> 47:32.903
I want my daughter
to be made whole.

47:34.004 --> 47:36.639
I want her to live and grow.

47:36.673 --> 47:40.609
I want her to run on the
grass and swim in the sea.

47:40.643 --> 47:43.044
And not suffer for the...

47:43.079 --> 47:45.713
For no reason.

47:47.882 --> 47:51.150
Do you recall what we
discussed earlier?

47:54.689 --> 47:57.524
An act of devotion.

48:17.208 --> 48:18.941
What is this?

48:20.510 --> 48:24.379
For the church... a donation.

48:24.716 --> 48:28.917
I'm not usually handled cash
directly, let alone jewels.

48:31.219 --> 48:33.954
Then tell me the proper method.

48:35.523 --> 48:38.458
Why are you doing this, Mrs.
Schroeder?

48:40.327 --> 48:42.694
It's a weight on me, father...

48:42.729 --> 48:45.463
On my soul.

48:45.498 --> 48:48.499
I want to be free of it,

48:49.968 --> 48:52.870
and show that I'm willing.

48:52.904 --> 48:56.206
Can we just start there?

49:05.348 --> 49:07.949
We can.

49:10.586 --> 49:12.787
Shall we pray?

49:30.203 --> 49:33.204
(Gulls cawing)

49:33.238 --> 49:35.506
What's so fascinating?

49:36.408 --> 49:38.509
That fella.

49:46.250 --> 49:48.517
Not a care in the world.

49:50.186 --> 49:52.754
He certainly doesn't
care what he looks like.

49:54.056 --> 49:56.690
Jimmy: He's on the shore.
It's summer.

49:56.724 --> 49:59.192
If you can't be free here...

49:59.227 --> 50:01.361
Put out a blanket and join him.

50:10.036 --> 50:14.216
- Richard drop you off?
- Yes.

50:14.240 --> 50:17.108
Where's Tommy?

50:17.143 --> 50:19.644
At your mother's.

50:20.713 --> 50:23.781
I have to leave
town for a few days

50:26.718 --> 50:28.786
you're not gonna ask me why?

50:28.820 --> 50:31.121
If you want me to
know, you'll tell me.

50:31.155 --> 50:33.557
- I trust you.
- You don't mean that.

50:33.591 --> 50:36.092
Let's not fight.

50:38.228 --> 50:40.296
I wasn't trying to.

50:47.004 --> 50:50.406
I know you're not happy, Angela.

50:57.579 --> 51:00.214
I know there are things
that you think about me

51:00.248 --> 51:02.315
that you're afraid to say.

51:02.350 --> 51:04.717
I'm gonna make it up to you.

51:04.752 --> 51:08.353
I'm gonna get everything settled...
once and for all.

51:08.387 --> 51:11.355
And you'll see that...

51:13.257 --> 51:16.725
I can be the person
you want me to be.

51:26.066 --> 51:28.667
I heard a joke today.

51:31.571 --> 51:34.105
Where?

51:34.139 --> 51:36.541
The bakery.

51:36.575 --> 51:39.043
You want to hear it?

51:40.145 --> 51:43.500
- Sure.
- A man goes into a hotel

51:43.535 --> 51:46.048
and he says,

51:46.083 --> 51:48.250
"I'd like a room and a bath."

51:48.285 --> 51:50.852
And the clerk says

51:50.887 --> 51:52.955
"I can give you a room,

51:52.994 --> 51:56.361
but you'll have to take
the bath yourself."

51:59.861 --> 52:01.461
Did I tell it wrong?

52:01.695 --> 52:04.155
No. It's funny.

52:04.179 --> 52:07.147
You have to take
the bath yourself.

52:21.947 --> 52:24.415
You sure you have to
leave right away?

52:25.716 --> 52:27.917
I'm not sure of anything.

52:47.568 --> 52:51.204
Unfortunately we didn't get
the results we'd hoped for.

52:51.239 --> 52:53.206
Spinal polio.

52:53.241 --> 52:56.175
The virus invades nerve cells,

52:56.209 --> 52:58.376
causing damage to the
muscles ithe limbs.

52:58.410 --> 53:00.845
If the cells are
completely destroyed,

53:00.879 --> 53:04.181
as in Emily's case,

53:04.215 --> 53:07.450
the paralysis will
mostly be permanent.

53:08.919 --> 53:11.020
You understand what I'm saying?

53:12.455 --> 53:14.322
Margaret?

53:23.998 --> 53:26.766
Did your daughter pray?

53:26.801 --> 53:29.669
- I'm sorry?
- Last night.

53:31.604 --> 53:34.039
You said she prays...

53:34.073 --> 53:36.841
For all the rest of us.

53:38.009 --> 53:40.311
I'm sure she did. Yes.

53:42.513 --> 53:45.514
Then bless her soul.

53:47.350 --> 53:48.751
What do we do now?

53:48.785 --> 53:50.953
We measure Emily for braces.

53:50.987 --> 53:53.188
You'll take her home.

53:53.222 --> 53:55.623
When she's ready,
we'll try therapy

53:55.658 --> 53:57.592
and hope for the best.

53:59.528 --> 54:02.062
I'd say that's good advice.

54:44.263 --> 54:47.730
- (Crickets chirping)
- (Shower running)

55:46.985 --> 55:49.219
(Soft creaking)

56:14.208 --> 56:16.709
(Muffled scream) No!

56:21.781 --> 56:23.916
(Whimpering)

56:27.987 --> 56:30.754
(Water shuts off)

56:39.095 --> 56:42.230
- (Screams)
- What the fuck?

56:42.265 --> 56:44.933
(Sobbing)

56:51.171 --> 56:54.340
Where's Darmody?

56:54.374 --> 56:56.842
He isn't here.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.080
You are his wife?

57:02.114 --> 57:04.082
Yes.

57:06.585 --> 57:09.052
Please...

57:09.087 --> 57:11.221
I have a child.

57:11.255 --> 57:13.556
Please?

57:13.591 --> 57:15.992
(Sobbing)

57:19.037 --> 57:20.971
Do you want money?

57:21.973 --> 57:24.174
He can get it. Lots of it.

57:24.208 --> 57:26.175
I can make him.

57:26.210 --> 57:27.610
(Sobbing)

57:27.644 --> 57:31.190
The most important thing
in life, darling?

57:31.214 --> 57:33.247
Your health.

57:34.716 --> 57:37.184
Your husband did this to you.

58:02.104 --> 58:05.206
