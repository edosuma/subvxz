WEBVTT

00:44.169 --> 00:45.420
(GASPS)

00:46.547 --> 00:48.214
You made me jump.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.300
Daisy, what is the matter with you?
You're all thumbs.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.928
Sorry. I hate this room.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.472
Why? What's the matter with it?

01:03.814 --> 01:05.273
ANNA: Daisy?

01:29.923 --> 01:31.674
Who's that from, Papa?

01:31.759 --> 01:34.594
- You seem very absorbed.
- Your aunt Rosamond.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.930
- Anything interesting?
- Nothing to trouble you with.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.058
Poor Aunt Rosamond.
All alone in that big house.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.978
- I feel so sorry for her.
- I don't.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.273
All alone with plenty of money
in a house in Eaton Square?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.484
I can't imagine anything better.

01:49.568 --> 01:52.111
Really, Mary,
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

01:52.196 --> 01:56.324
There will come a day when
someone thinks you mean what you say.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.951
It can't come soon enough for me.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.579
Carson, I'll be in the library.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.456
Will you let me know
when her ladyship is down?

02:03.540 --> 02:06.542
- Certainly, my lord.
- Sybil, darling. This one's for you.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.426
SYBIL: I saw another opening
for a secretary and I applied.

02:15.677 --> 02:19.514
- But you never said.
- I didn't want you to be disappointed.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.724
I thought you'd given up.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.185
I'll never give up and nor will you.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.395
Things are changing for women, Gwen.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.858
- Notjust the vote but our lives.
- But it's tomorrow! At 10:00.

02:31.235 --> 02:35.071
Last time we waited for weeks
and weeks, and this one's tomorrow!

02:35.239 --> 02:38.366
Then we must be ready
by tomorrow, mustn't we?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.369
I thought I'd write to Edith

02:41.453 --> 02:43.788
- to settle our promised church visit.
- Lfyou want.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.206
We can'tjust throw her over

02:45.290 --> 02:47.250
when she made such an effort
to arrange the last one.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.627
- It's all in your head.
- I don't think so.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.171
Then she's barking up the wrong tree.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.508
Poor Edith. I hope there's a right tree
for her somewhere.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.636
Ma'am, I was wondering if
I might take some time this afternoon

02:58.720 --> 03:01.180
- to help in the village hall.
- Why? What's happening?

03:01.265 --> 03:03.182
It's the flower show, sir, next Saturday.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.768
I'll give my father a hand with his stall,
if I may.

03:05.853 --> 03:09.313
- Ofcourse you must go.
- And so, I'm afraid, must I.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.578
Is Mr Carson about?

03:23.662 --> 03:25.913
I don't think so.
I was just looking for him, myself.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.047
(EXHALES)

03:36.550 --> 03:37.717
Busy?

03:37.843 --> 03:41.345
I'm just trying to sort out
the wretched flower show.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.933
- I've had a letter from Rosamond.
- Don't tell me.

03:46.143 --> 03:50.229
She wants a saddle of lamb and
all the fruit and vegetables we can muster.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.773
She enjoys a taste of her old home.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.276
She enjoys not paying for food.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.278
There's something else...

03:57.362 --> 04:00.364
Apparently, the word is going round London
that Evelyn Napier

04:00.449 --> 04:02.408
has given up any thought of Mary.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.286
That he's going to marry
one ofthe Semphill girls.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.873
She writes as if, somehow,
it reflects badly on Mary.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.460
Your dear sister is always
such a harbinger ofjoy.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.128
No, as if...

04:15.631 --> 04:19.508
As if Mary had somehow been
found wanting. In her character.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.012
I don't believe Mr Napier
would have said that.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.349
- Neither do I, really, but...
- She ought to be married.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.435
- Talk to her.
- She never listens to me.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.021
Lfshe did, she'd marry Matthew.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.357
What about Anthony Strallan?

04:34.483 --> 04:38.277
Anthony Strallan is at least my age
and as dull as paint.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.530
I doubt she'd want to sit next to him
at dinner, let alone marry him.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.200
She has to marry someone, Robert.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.787
And ifthis is what's being said in London,
she has to marry soon.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.379
You shouldn't do that in here.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.465
I don't like being in the pantry all alone.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.550
And Mr Carson won't mind.
He's gone into the village.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.678
He'll mind if I tell him.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.389
- That's pretty.
- Do you think so?

05:06.682 --> 05:10.393
She wants it put onto a new shirt,
but it's a bit old-fashioned to my taste.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.186
Oh, no, it's lovely.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.648
Have you recovered, Daisy?

05:17.067 --> 05:19.568
- What from?
- She had a bit of a turn.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.487
When we were in Lady Mary's room.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.155
- Didn't you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.075
What sort of a turn? Did you see a ghost?

05:26.201 --> 05:28.494
Will you leave her alone,
ifshe doesn't want to talk about it?

05:28.578 --> 05:32.248
I've often wondered ifthis place
is haunted. It ought to be.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.167
By the spirits of maids and
footmen who died in slavery.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.086
But not, in Thomas's case, from overwork.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.421
(O'BRIEN SCOFFS)

05:42.092 --> 05:44.260
Come on, Daisy. What was it?

05:51.351 --> 05:54.270
I don't know. I was thinking...
First we had the Titanic.

05:54.396 --> 05:58.357
- Don't keep harping back to that.
- I know it was a while ago, but we knew 'em.

05:58.442 --> 06:03.946
I think of how I laid the fires for Mr Patrick,
but he drowned in them icy waters.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.364
For God's sake.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.867
And then there was the Turkish gentleman.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.453
Itjust seems there's been
too much death in the house.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.581
But what's that got to do
with Lady Mary's bedroom?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.792
Nothing. Nothing at all.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.973
Afternoon, ma'am.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.810
When do you put that magnificent display
of prizes on show?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.395
Not till the day itself.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.898
I remember a superb cup from last year.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.399
The Grantham Cup.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.652
It was donated by the late Lord Grantham
for the best bloom in the village.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.238
- And who won it?
- I did.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.117
Well done.

06:51.495 --> 06:55.915
- And the year before?
- Her Ladyship won that one, too.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.669
Heavens, how thrilling. And before that?

07:02.214 --> 07:04.131
You've met my father.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.717
Good afternoon, Mr Molesley.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.221
- What are you showing this year?
- Oh, this and that.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.099
MOLESLEY: Only the finest roses
in the village.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.476
Really? What an achievement.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.563
It's a wonderful area for roses.
We're very lucky.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.900
We'll see some beautiful
examples right across the show.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.695
- Won't we, Mr Molesley?
- Lfyou say so, your ladyship.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.047
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

07:45.715 --> 07:49.969
His lordship's blaming Mr Napier
for spreading gossip about Lady Mary,

07:50.053 --> 07:52.847
- but it was you, wasn't it?
- Why do you say that?

07:52.931 --> 07:55.224
Because Napier wasn't in on it.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.768
Only four people know
he was in her room that night.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.187
You, me, Lady Mary and possibly Daisy.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.981
And I haven't said nothing to nobody.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.399
Well, I didn't tell about Pamuk.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.152
I just wrote that Lady Mary
was no better than she ought to be.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.195
- Who did you write it to?
- Only a friend of mine.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.613
Valet to Lord Savident.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.448
Oh, you know what they say
about old Savident.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.909
Not so much an open mind
as an open mouth.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.370
- No wonder it's all round London.
- You won't tell, will you?

08:16.454 --> 08:19.665
- I'm in enough trouble as it is.
- Why? What's happened?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.584
I think Mr Bates saw me nicking
a bottle ofwine.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.586
- Has he told Mr Carson?
- Not yet.

08:23.712 --> 08:27.256
But he will when he's feeling spiteful.
I wish we could be shot of him.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.549
Then think ofsomething quick.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.595
Turn the tables on him,
before he has the chance to nail you.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.058
I thought you went to bed hours ago.

08:38.143 --> 08:41.395
I was writing a note for Lynch.
I need the governess cart tomorrow.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.563
Oh?

08:42.647 --> 08:45.900
- I'm going into Malton.
- Don't risk the traffic in Malton.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.110
Not now every Tom, Dick and Harry
seems to have a motor.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.029
- Hardly.
- Last time I was there,

08:50.113 --> 08:52.364
there were five cars
parked in the market place,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.575
and another three drove past
while I was waiting.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.077
Get Branson to take you in the car.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.831
- Neither of us is using it.
- I thought I'd pop in on old Mrs Stuart.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.292
Will you tell Mama, if I forget?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.179
You're late this morning.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.681
The library grate needed a real going-over.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.143
- Are any ofthem down yet?
- Lady Sybil's in the dining room.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.938
- I'll start with her room, then.
- Daisy?

09:24.981 --> 09:28.275
You know when you were talking
about the feeling ofdeath in the house.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.610
I was just being silly.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.696
I found myselfwondering
about the connection between

09:32.822 --> 09:36.659
the poor Turkish gentleman, Mr Pamuk,
and Lady Mary's room.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.872
Only you were saying how
you felt so uncomfortable in there.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.670
Well, I've got to get on.
I'm late enough as it is.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.221
Hello.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.646
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, hello. I am about to send a telegram.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.855
Oh.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.736
Papa's sister is always nagging
him to send supplies to London,

10:12.862 --> 10:16.865
and then we cable her so her butler
can be at King's Cross to meet them.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.286
- It's idiotic, really.
- Is this Lady Rosamond Painswick?

10:20.370 --> 10:23.747
- You have done your homework.
- She wrote to welcome me into the family,

10:23.873 --> 10:27.251
which I thought pretty generous,
given the circumstances.

10:27.377 --> 10:31.046
It's easy to be generous
when you have nothing to lose.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.342
So are you doing any more
church visiting with Edith?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.261
My mother's trying to set something up.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.888
Watch out. I think she has big plans for you.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.433
Then she's in for
an equally big disappointment.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.945
- Is it all right to do the fire?
- Why are you so late?

10:55.071 --> 10:58.157
I went back to my room
after I'd woken everyone,

10:58.283 --> 11:01.994
and I just shut my eyes for a moment.
I've been trying to catch up ever since.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.496
- ANNA: Have you had any breakfast?
- Not a crumb.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.748
Here.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.085
- Wait! You can't take her biscuits.
- She never eats them. None ofthem do.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.212
They're just thrown away
and changed every evening.

11:12.297 --> 11:16.091
Thanks. She wouldn't mind anyway.
She's nice, Lady Sybil.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.511
(EXCLAIMS)

11:24.934 --> 11:26.477
- Gwen?
- (GASPS)

11:27.437 --> 11:30.773
May I ask why you are sitting
on Lady Sybil's bed?

11:31.274 --> 11:35.819
Well, you see, I had a turn,
like a burst ofsickness, just sudden-like.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.488
I had to sit down.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.616
- It's true.
- Well, you'd better go and lie down.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.161
- I'll tell Mrs Hughes.
- I don't need to interrupt her morning.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.872
I'm sure I'll be fine
if I could just put my feet up.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.458
And how many bedrooms
have you still got to do?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.795
- Just one. Lady Edith's.
- And you can manage on your own?

11:52.962 --> 11:55.964
Well, she's no use
to man or beast in that state.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.299
Go on. Shoo.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.222
Daisy?

12:03.306 --> 12:06.975
May I ask why you are holding
Lady Sybil's biscuitjar?

12:09.979 --> 12:12.981
I was just polishing it before I put it back.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.651
See that you do.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.745
MRS PATMORE: I'm sorry, my lady,
but I can't do more than my best.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.706
Is there some difficulty, your ladyship?

12:30.208 --> 12:31.792
Dear Mrs Hughes, as you know,

12:31.876 --> 12:34.503
we're giving a dinner on Friday
for Sir Anthony Strallan.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.712
Yes, my lady.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.799
Well, it seems he is particularly fond
of a certain new pudding.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.093
It's called apple charlotte. Do you know it?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.637
I'm not sure.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.140
His sister, Mrs Chetwood,
sent me the receipt,

12:46.224 --> 12:48.434
I'm trying to persuade Mrs Patmore
to make it.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.227
And I'm trying to persuade her ladyship

12:50.311 --> 12:54.189
that I have already planned the dinner
with her, and I can't change it now.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.357
Why not?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.818
Because everything's been
ordered and prepared.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.446
Well, there's nothing here
that looks very complicated.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.239
Apples, lemons, butter...

13:02.323 --> 13:05.451
I cannot work from a new receipt
at a moment's notice!

13:05.535 --> 13:07.870
But I can read it to you,
ifthat's the problem.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.288
Problem?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.290
Who mentioned a problem?

13:11.374 --> 13:14.793
How dare you say such a thing
in front of her ladyship!

13:14.878 --> 13:18.422
Very well. We'll try it another time,
when you've had longer to prepare.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.757
We'll stay with the raspberry meringue.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.635
- And very nice it'll be, too.
- I'm sure.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.266
MRS PATMORE:
Have you taken leave ofyour senses?

13:29.350 --> 13:32.394
I'm so sorry about that, my lady.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.855
Never mind. I was asking a lot.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.858
- Do look after that girl.
- Daisy?

13:38.067 --> 13:41.153
- She's used to it. She'll be all right.
- I wonder.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.739
Mrs Patmore looks ready to eat her alive.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.157
I was only trying to help.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.619
Oh, like Judas was only
"trying to help" I suppose,

13:48.703 --> 13:50.746
when he brought the Roman soldiers
to the garden!

14:07.555 --> 14:10.724
I had to let your skirt down a little,
but I can put it back.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.518
No, it's yours.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.145
What will happen
ifone ofthe maids finds your room is empty?

14:15.230 --> 14:17.606
Oh, but it'd only be Anna,
and she wouldn't give me away.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.108
She's like a sister. She'd never betray me.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.570
(CHUCKLES) Then she's not like my sisters.
Walk on.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.830
- Shall I give you a hand?
- Oh, would you?

14:33.915 --> 14:36.333
It takes halfthe time with two.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.339
- I always feel a bit sorry for Lady Edith.
- Me too.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.674
Although I don't know why,

14:43.758 --> 14:46.677
when you think what
she's got and we haven't.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.805
Mrs Hughes said she was after
the other heir, Mr Patrick Crawley.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.140
- The one who drowned.
- That was different.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.434
- She was in love with him.
- What happened?

14:54.519 --> 14:57.854
She never got a look in.
He was all set up to marry Lady Mary.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.108
Then he was a braver man
than I am, Gunga Din.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.822
Sad to think about.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.200
It's always sad when you love someone
who doesn't love you back.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.202
No matter who you are.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.081
No, I mean it's sad that he died.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.293
Oh. Yes.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.088
Very sad. He was nice.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.509
Well, thank you for that.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.637
- Much appreciated.
- My pleasure.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.975
Perhaps Mr Patrick did love her back,
he just couldn't say it.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.605
Why ever not?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.899
Sometimes we're not at liberty to speak.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.485
Sometimes it wouldn't be right.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.713
Take a seat.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.727
(DOOR OPENING)

16:33.743 --> 16:35.744
COUNTESS: The flower show?

16:35.870 --> 16:38.580
Oh, I thought I was in for another
telling off about the hospital.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.957
No. This time it's the flower show.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.835
I've been to see old Mr Molesley's garden.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.798
And his roses are the most beautiful
I've ever laid eyes on.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.092
- Go on.
- You may not know it,

16:50.176 --> 16:53.220
but I believe the committee feel
obliged to give you the cup

16:53.304 --> 16:55.889
for the best bloom
as a kind of local tradition.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.100
No. No, I do not know that.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.312
I thought I usually won the prize
for "best bloom in the village"

17:02.397 --> 17:06.400
because my gardener had
grown the best bloom in the village.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.861
Yes, but you don't "usually" win, do you?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.030
You always win.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.160
Yes. I have been very fortunate
in that regard.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.580
But, surely, when Mr Molesley's garden
is so remarkable

17:20.665 --> 17:23.375
and he is so very proud of his roses...

17:23.501 --> 17:25.919
You talk of Mr Molesley's pride?

17:26.754 --> 17:29.172
What about my gardener's pride?

17:29.674 --> 17:33.260
Is he to be sacrificed on the altar
of Molesley's ambition?

17:33.386 --> 17:37.889
All I'm asking is that you release them
from any obligation to let you win.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.892
Why notjust tell them to choose
whichever flower is best?

17:40.977 --> 17:44.104
But that is precisely what they already know.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.772
And do.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.416
I'm sorry, my lord.
I didn't think you'd be in here.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.961
Are my eyes deceiving me
or is one ofthese missing?

18:08.504 --> 18:11.840
- I don't know them well enough.
- No. Why would you?

18:11.924 --> 18:16.136
But there's a very pretty little blue one,
with a miniature framed in French paste.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.847
It was made for a German prince.
I forget who.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.808
Unless it's been moved for some reason.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.853
But why would it be?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.868
Can you help? I should be so grateful.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.205
Our horse has cast a shoe.
Is there a smithy nearby?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.457
Aye. You can try old Crump
in the next village.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.833
BOTH: Thank you.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.044
See, help's at hand.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.296
And at least it happened on the way home.

18:51.380 --> 18:55.550
Oh, they'll be worried about you.
And ifthey check on me, I'm finished.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.723
- Is her ladyship wearing that now?
- Oh, no. This is for Friday night.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.309
I just thought I'd give it a press
while I had the time.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.561
You don't know what's happened
to Lady Sybil, do you?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.064
I've got the changes ready for the other two,
but there's no sign of her.

19:09.190 --> 19:12.234
Don't you start. I've had Her Majesty
on at me all afternoon.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.487
Mr Carson says he'll fetch the police
ifshe's not back soon.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.990
Sorry, Miss. But Mr Crump's
staying over at the Skelton estate tonight.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.492
He's working there all week.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.245
- Is there anyone else?
- Not that I know of.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.883
SYBIL: Come on, Dragon, come on!

19:41.722 --> 19:45.684
Dragon, ifyou don't move now,
I'll have you boiled for glue!

19:52.066 --> 19:55.694
But what ifshe's overturned?
What ifshe's lying in a ditch somewhere?

19:55.778 --> 19:58.697
I'm sure she'll be back
in the shake of a lamb's tail.

19:58.781 --> 20:02.534
The truth is they're all getting
too old for a mother's control.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.953
- They're growing up.
- They've grown up.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.038
They need their own establishments.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.916
I'm sure they'll all get plenty ofoffers.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.129
No one ever warns you
about bringing up daughters.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.047
You think it's going to be like Little Women,

20:16.132 --> 20:19.259
and instead they're at each other's throats
from dawn till dusk.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.645
You look done in.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.648
I'll bring you some food up later
when we've finished dinner.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.151
Where were you?

20:38.487 --> 20:41.197
- You came up, then?
- Ofcourse I did.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.117
- I had to change for the afternoon.
- Did you cover for me?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.661
What do you think?

20:48.331 --> 20:50.916
I don't suppose this had
anything to do with Lady Sybil?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.668
Oh, Anna, it was a nightmare.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.630
I don't know how I got in
without being seen.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.882
I'm sure I've left a trail of mud up the stairs.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.218
So, did you get the job?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.015
We'll have to wait and see.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.184
(CHUCKLES)

21:18.402 --> 21:20.070
Sorry to bother you, my lady,

21:20.196 --> 21:22.530
but your mother wanted you
to know Lady Sybil's back.

21:22.657 --> 21:25.241
She's changing now,
so dinner won't be late, after all.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.370
- What happened to her?
- The horse went lame.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.210
Is there anything else?

21:36.379 --> 21:39.381
There is something
that's been troubling me.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.677
You remember the Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk?

21:43.761 --> 21:46.513
- The one who died all sudden-like?
- Ofcourse I remember.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.890
Well, it's Daisy, my lady.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.852
The kitchen maid.

21:53.229 --> 21:57.232
Only she's been talking recently as if
she had ideas about Mr Pamuk's death.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.568
What sort of ideas?

22:00.861 --> 22:03.363
Well, I've no proof and maybe I'm wrong.

22:04.031 --> 22:08.076
But I've a sense she knows something,
but won't say what.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.538
Something involving Lady Mary.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.917
How absurd.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.628
Well, what could she know?

22:19.088 --> 22:22.549
Whatever it is, she won't say.
Not to us, anyway.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.595
Have you spoken to Lady Mary about this?

22:27.722 --> 22:32.225
I didn't like to, my lady.
It seemed impertinent somehow.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.270
But I thought someone in the family
ought to know about it.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.605
Quite right.

22:40.109 --> 22:44.279
Bring the girl to my room tomorrow,
after breakfast.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.081
- What did she want?
- Nothing.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.794
Just a message from Mama to say
that Sybil had turned up alive.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.796
Poor darling.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.466
She had to walk for miles.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.302
I don't think I'd have got down,
however lame the horse.

23:07.428 --> 23:10.013
No. I don't believe you would.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.943
I couldn't say, my lady.
I don't know what Miss O'Brien means.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.403
I didn't see nothing.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.865
Well, not much.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.826
O'Brien, I wonder ifyou might leave us?

23:42.004 --> 23:45.715
Now, it's Daisy, isn't it?

23:47.218 --> 23:48.718
Yes, my lady.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.138
I'm sure you see
O'Brien only acted as she did

23:52.223 --> 23:55.350
- because she is concerned.
- I suppose so, my lady.

23:56.227 --> 24:00.146
She seems to think that you are
in possession ofsome knowledge

24:00.231 --> 24:02.816
that is uncomfortable for you.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.234
(SNIFFLING)

24:04.860 --> 24:08.780
Because ifthat is the case,
then I don't think it fair on you.

24:09.031 --> 24:12.117
Why should you be burdened
with Mary's secret?

24:15.121 --> 24:18.456
My dear, my heart goes out to you.
It really does.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.292
There, there.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.467
You've been carrying too heavy a burden
for too long.

24:31.220 --> 24:36.432
Just tell me, and I promise you'll feel better.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.572
COUNTESS: You seem well prepared.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.616
They'll add a few more flowers
before we open in the morning,

24:53.742 --> 24:55.451
but I think we're nearly there.

24:55.578 --> 24:59.122
Do look at Mr Molesley's display.
He's worked so hard.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.543
They're rather marvellous, aren't they?

25:03.627 --> 25:06.504
Lovely. Well done, Mr Molesley.

25:06.589 --> 25:07.755
Thank you, my lady.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.758
I think everyone is to be congratulated.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.802
It's splendid.

25:12.928 --> 25:16.181
But do look at these roses.
Have you ever seen the like?

25:16.265 --> 25:20.518
My dear, Mrs Crawley believes
I am profiting from an unfair advantage.

25:20.603 --> 25:21.769
Oh?

25:21.854 --> 25:24.355
She feels, in the past,
I have been given the cup

25:24.440 --> 25:27.066
merely as a matter of routine
rather than merit.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.445
That's rather ungallant, Mother.
I'm sure when we see Cousin Violet's roses,

25:30.529 --> 25:32.238
it will be hard to think they could be bettered.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.948
Hard. But not impossible.

25:35.451 --> 25:39.871
You are quite wonderful the way
you see room for improvement

25:39.955 --> 25:41.497
wherever you look.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.251
I never knew such reforming zeal.

25:45.336 --> 25:48.296
I take that as a compliment.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.465
I must have said it wrong.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.716
(LAUGHS)

25:55.221 --> 25:58.932
Poor Granny.
She's not used to being challenged.

25:59.016 --> 26:03.186
Nor is Mother. I think we should
let them settle it between them.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.690
So are you interested in flowers?

26:07.775 --> 26:10.026
I'm interested in the village.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.862
In fact, I'm on my way
to inspect the cottages.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.573
You know what all work
and no play did for Jack?

26:16.450 --> 26:19.118
But you think I'm a dull boy anyway.
Don't you?

26:19.578 --> 26:22.455
I play, too. I'm coming up for dinner tonight.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.166
I suspect I'm there to balance the numbers.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.544
- Is it in aid of anything?
- Not that I know of.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.547
Just a couple ofdreary neighbours,
that's all.

26:31.632 --> 26:35.510
- Maybe I'll shine by comparison.
- COUNTESS: Mary! We're going.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.266
Maybe you will.

26:46.981 --> 26:48.773
(CHATTERING)

26:52.278 --> 26:54.529
CARSON: Might I have a word?

26:56.407 --> 26:58.866
I want to say something
before I ring the gong.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.994
I'm afraid it's not very pleasant.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.706
His Lordship is missing
a very valuable snuff box.

27:04.957 --> 27:08.251
It appears to have been taken
from the case in his room.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.129
Ifone ofyou knows anything about this,

27:11.213 --> 27:13.673
will he or she please come to me.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.593
Your words will be heard
in the strictest confidence.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.639
Thank you.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.857
I am sorry, Mr Bates.

27:31.775 --> 27:34.193
What an unpleasant thing to have happened.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.695
Why are you picking on him?

27:35.779 --> 27:38.323
Because he's the only one of us
who goes in there.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.408
But don't worry. I'm sure it'll turn up.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.035
Thank you for your concern.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.213
I hate this kind ofthing.
I hope to God they find it.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.385
Better get a move on.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.891
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

28:05.059 --> 28:07.101
I'm coming.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.230
Does this brooch work? I can't decide.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.815
It's charming.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.660
Oh, dear. Is it another scolding?

28:24.745 --> 28:26.079
Ofcourse not.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.831
You're too grown up to scold these days.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.793
Heavens. Then it's really serious.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.465
I'd like you to look after
Sir Anthony Strallan tonight.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.884
He's a nice, decent man.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.762
His position may not be quite like Papa's

28:42.846 --> 28:45.431
but it would still make you
a force for good in the county.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.016
Mama, not again!

28:47.309 --> 28:50.770
How many times am I to be ordered to
marry the man sitting next to me at dinner?

28:50.854 --> 28:52.939
As many times as it takes.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.649
I turned down Matthew Crawley.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.527
Is it likely I'd marry Strallan
when I wouldn't marry him?

28:57.611 --> 29:00.613
I am glad you've come to think
more highly of Cousin Matthew.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.492
- That's not the point.
- No.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.412
The point is, when you refused Matthew

29:07.496 --> 29:10.581
you were the daughter of an earl
with an unsullied reputation.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.251
Now you are damaged goods.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.295
- Mama...
- Somehow, I don't know how,

29:16.380 --> 29:20.007
there is a rumour in London
that you are not virtuous.

29:20.342 --> 29:24.971
- What? Does Papa know about this?
- He knows it and he dismisses it,

29:25.055 --> 29:28.015
because, unlike you and me,
he does not know that it is true.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.024
Let's hope it's just unkind gossip.

29:37.151 --> 29:39.569
Because if anyone heard about...

29:41.488 --> 29:44.198
Kemal. My lover.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.285
- Kemal Pamuk.
- Exactly.

29:47.703 --> 29:50.204
If it gets around,
and you're not already married,

29:50.289 --> 29:53.749
every door in London
will be slammed in your face.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.502
Mama, the world is changing.

29:57.212 --> 30:00.756
Not that much, and not fast enough for you.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.552
I know you mean to help.
I know you love me.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.513
But I also know what I'm capable of,

30:07.598 --> 30:11.684
and forty years of boredom
and duty just isn't possible for me.

30:11.768 --> 30:12.810
I'm sorry.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.440
I do love you and I want to help.

30:17.900 --> 30:22.612
I'm a lost cause, Mama.
Leave me to manage my own affairs.

30:23.947 --> 30:28.242
Why not concentrate on Edith?
She needs all the help she can get.

30:29.536 --> 30:33.831
You mustn't be unkind to Edith.
She has fewer advantages than you.

30:34.041 --> 30:36.709
MARY: Fewer? She has none at all.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.096
Open the oven.

30:54.228 --> 30:55.603
(SHRIEKS)

30:55.687 --> 30:56.854
What's happened?

30:56.939 --> 30:58.648
It's that bloomin' Daisy!

30:58.732 --> 31:00.942
I said she'd be the death of me,
and now my word's come true!

31:01.026 --> 31:03.277
I didn't do nothing!

31:03.487 --> 31:06.697
Get away! Get back to the stables!

31:06.782 --> 31:08.491
What'll you serve now?

31:08.575 --> 31:11.327
Why, them, ofcourse.
I ain't got nothing else.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.996
Daisy give us a hand, get that cloth.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.339
What's the matter with that?

31:23.423 --> 31:25.675
Are you sure? Shouldn't we tell?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.636
- Certainly not.
- Is the remove ready to go up?

31:28.720 --> 31:29.762
Here we are.

31:29.846 --> 31:31.931
ANNA: Daisy, give him a hand
with the vegetables.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.809
They're up in the servery, in the warmer.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.602
Well, I'm glad I don't have to eat them.

31:36.687 --> 31:40.189
What the eye can't see,
the heart won't grieve over.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.322
Hmm, there's no doubt about it.
The next few years in farming

31:48.407 --> 31:51.033
are going to be about mechanisation.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.995
That's the test,
and we're going to have to meet it.

31:54.079 --> 31:59.959
- Don't you agree, Lady Mary?
- Yes, ofcourse, Sir Anthony. I'm sure I do.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.964
Are we ever going to be allowed to turn?

32:07.426 --> 32:12.680
Sir Anthony, it must be so hard
to meet the challenge ofthe future

32:12.764 --> 32:14.307
and yet be fair to your employees.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.226
That is the point, precisely.

32:17.769 --> 32:22.064
We can't fight progress, but we must
find ways to soften the blow.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.525
I should love to see
one ofthe new harvesters,

32:24.610 --> 32:26.152
ifyou would ever let me.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.280
- We don't have one here.
- I shall be delighted.

32:35.037 --> 32:39.206
I hope they find that snuff box.
What happens ifthey don't?

32:39.333 --> 32:41.334
They'll organise a search, won't they?

32:41.418 --> 32:44.253
I wouldn't be Mr Bates.
Not for all the tea in China.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.590
Wouldn't you, Thomas?
I dare say he feels just the same about you.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.387
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

32:58.894 --> 33:03.230
Oh! Just a minute.
I don't like to put it on earlier.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.692
It sinks in and spoils the effect.

33:12.949 --> 33:15.368
Mama has released me, thank God.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.412
Sir Anthony seems nice enough.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.791
Lfyou want to talk farming
and foxes by the hour.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.337
I'm rather looking forward
to the flower show tomorrow.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.383
Where Mr Molesley's roses
will turn everybody's heads.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.344
But ifyou tell Granny I said so,
I'll denounce you as a liar.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.804
I wouldn't dare.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.722
I'll leave that to my fearless mother.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.015
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

33:39.267 --> 33:41.727
- How were the cottages?
- They're coming on wonderfully.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.479
I'd love to show you.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.482
Obviously, it's an act offaith at this stage.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.110
Good God!

33:49.194 --> 33:50.486
(CHOKING)

33:51.113 --> 33:52.655
What on earth?

33:52.739 --> 33:55.658
I do apologise, Lady Grantham.
But I had a mouthful ofsalt.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.909
What?

33:59.204 --> 34:01.497
Everyone, put down your forks.

34:01.581 --> 34:05.793
Carson, remove this.
Bring fruit, bring cheese,

34:06.086 --> 34:10.798
bring anything to take this taste away!
Sir Anthony, I am so sorry.

34:11.842 --> 34:15.594
Fains I be Mrs Patmore's
kitchen maid when the news gets out.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.723
Poor girl.
We ought to send in a rescue party.

34:18.890 --> 34:22.393
- You must think us very disorganised.
- Not at all.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.645
These things happen.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.855
(LAUGHING)

34:26.022 --> 34:27.356
(CRYING)

34:28.817 --> 34:33.404
Hey! Come on. It's not that bad.
Nobody's died.

34:34.281 --> 34:38.367
I don't understand it!
It must have been that Daisy!

34:38.869 --> 34:41.287
- She's muddled everything up before now!
- But I never...

34:41.371 --> 34:43.914
Don't worry, Daisy.
You're not in the line offire here.

34:43.999 --> 34:47.752
I know that pudding!
I chose it 'cause I know it!

34:47.961 --> 34:50.963
Which is why you wouldn't let her ladyship
have the pudding she wanted.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.923
Because you didn't know it.

34:53.008 --> 34:54.300
Exactly!

34:59.556 --> 35:02.850
I don't see how it happened.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.103
Come on, everyone. Let's give Mrs Patmore
some room to breathe.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.690
- You, too.
- I don't think I should leave her.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.359
Yes, you should.
Mr Carson knows what he's doing.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.030
Don't do that.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.867
Get William or the hall boy to do it.
It's beneath your dignity.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.994
It won't kill me.

35:25.499 --> 35:26.665
Now.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.544
All in your own good time,

35:33.507 --> 35:37.176
I think you've got something to tell me,
haven't you?

35:39.596 --> 35:42.348
ANNA: I think I knowwhere that snuff box is.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.558
Where?

35:45.101 --> 35:47.978
- Hidden in your room.
- You don't think...

35:48.063 --> 35:50.689
'Course I don't, you silly beggar.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.150
- Then?
- I bet Thomas'd like it

35:53.235 --> 35:55.653
ifthey took you for a thief.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.281
Yes, I expect he would.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.575
Go upstairs now and find it.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.620
And when you have, you can
choose whether to put it in Thomas's room

36:04.704 --> 36:07.790
or give it to me,
and I'll slip it into Miss O'Brien's.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.001
- You naughty girl.
- Fight fire with fire.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.003
That's what my mum says.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.886
Poor Mrs Patmore. Do you think
you should go down and see her?

36:20.971 --> 36:24.890
Tomorrow. She needs time
to recover her nerves.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.518
I knew there was something going on.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.521
It seems hard that poor Sir Anthony
had to pay the price.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.439
Good God!

36:32.566 --> 36:34.108
(LAUGHS)

36:34.359 --> 36:38.237
As for your giggling like
a ridiculous schoolgirl with Cousin Matthew!

36:38.321 --> 36:40.614
- It was pathetic.
- Poor Edith.

36:40.782 --> 36:43.951
I am sorry Cousin Matthew's
proved a disappointment to you.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.703
Who says he has?

36:46.037 --> 36:48.163
Matthew. He told me.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.585
Oh, sorry. Wasn't I supposed to know?

36:53.879 --> 36:57.256
You were very helpful, Edith,
looking after Sir Anthony.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.050
- You saved the day.
- I enjoyed it.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.470
We seemed to have a lot to talk about.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.777
- Spare me your boasting, please.
- Now who's jealous?

37:19.279 --> 37:23.240
Jealous? Do you think I couldn't
have that old booby if I wanted him?

37:23.408 --> 37:26.327
- Even you can't take every prize.
- Is that a challenge?

37:27.287 --> 37:28.746
Lfyou like.

37:33.335 --> 37:36.754
I could almost manage for a long time,

37:36.838 --> 37:39.924
knowing the kitchen
and where everything was kept.

37:40.008 --> 37:44.678
- Even with that fool girl.
- I think you might owe Daisy an apology.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.847
Maybe.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.643
I've had a lot to put up with, I can tell you.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.520
And you've not been to a doctor?

37:54.481 --> 37:57.858
I don't need a doctor to tell me
I'm going blind.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.198
A blind cook, Mr Carson.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.367
(EXCLAIMS)
What ajoke.

38:06.993 --> 38:09.328
Whoever heard ofsuch a thing?

38:10.538 --> 38:12.039
A blind cook.

38:18.380 --> 38:21.715
I hope our salty pudding
didn't spoil the evening for you.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.552
- On the contrary.
- I'm glad you and Mary are getting along.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.722
- There's no reason you can't be friends.
- No. No reason at all.

38:28.807 --> 38:32.810
I don't suppose there's any chance
that you could sort ofstart again?

38:32.978 --> 38:34.812
Life is full ofsurprises.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.901
Ah! I've been waiting for you.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.987
I've found a book over here
and I think it's just the thing

38:43.071 --> 38:44.321
to catch your interest.

38:44.406 --> 38:47.324
Oh, really? I'm intrigued. What could it be?

38:47.409 --> 38:49.410
Well, I was looking in the library and I...

38:49.536 --> 38:52.746
I was very taken by
what you were saying over dinner

38:52.872 --> 38:54.415
- about the way we...
- You're so right, Lady Mary.

38:54.541 --> 38:58.085
How clever you are. This is exactly
what we have to be aware of.

39:00.588 --> 39:04.008
There's a section just here
that I was rather unsure about.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.932
It seems we have both been
thrown over for a bigger prize.

39:13.935 --> 39:16.103
Heavens, is that the time?

39:16.688 --> 39:18.022
You're not going?

39:18.106 --> 39:19.940
The truth is my head's splitting.

39:20.066 --> 39:23.402
I don't want to spoil the party,
so I'll slip away.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.281
Would you make my excuses
to your parents?

39:32.287 --> 39:34.371
Excuse me, Sir Anthony.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.547
- Has Mr Crawley left?
- Yes, my lady.

39:43.631 --> 39:44.965
But what about the car?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.051
Branson can't have brought it round
so quickly.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.969
He said he'd rather walk, my lady.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.429
Thank you.

39:52.557 --> 39:55.809
- Mary can be such a child.
- What do you mean, darling?

39:58.438 --> 40:00.981
ROBERT: She thinks if you put a toy down,
it'll still be sitting there

40:01.107 --> 40:03.650
when you wantto playwith it again.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.616
- What are you talking about?
- Never mind.

40:22.504 --> 40:23.962
Mr Carson?

40:24.839 --> 40:27.424
We were wondering about that snuff box.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.636
- Has it turned up yet?
- I'm afraid not.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.806
Well, I think we should have a search.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.182
What?

40:35.683 --> 40:37.684
It doesn't do to leave these things too long.

40:37.852 --> 40:41.855
Mr Carson can search the men's rooms,
Mrs Hughes the women's.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.191
And it should be right away,
now we've talked of it.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.777
So no one has a chance to hide the box.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.529
Don't you agree, Mr Carson?

40:48.613 --> 40:52.866
Well, perhaps it's for best.
Although I'm sure I won't find anything.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.035
I'll fetch Mrs Hughes.

40:56.621 --> 41:00.290
- I think I'll just...
- I'd better check it's tidy.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.795
The bastard's hidden it
in my room or yours.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.381
Why did I ever listen to you
in the first place?

41:10.718 --> 41:12.344
Miss O'Brien?

41:16.558 --> 41:20.227
My, my. You have been busy.

41:27.068 --> 41:31.363
I was expecting you later than this.
I'll tell Molesley to lock up.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.574
Thanks. Good night, Mother.

41:35.243 --> 41:38.579
How was your evening?
Did you enjoy yourself?

41:40.081 --> 41:41.331
Quite.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.918
The thing is, just for a moment I thought...

41:48.214 --> 41:51.550
Never mind what I thought.
I was wrong. Good night.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.775
My word, Molesley, splendid roses as usual.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.611
- Well done.
- Thank you, your lordship.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.697
All the stalls are set out very well this year.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.700
This is enchanting. Do we grow this?

42:16.784 --> 42:19.536
I doubt ifyou've got that one, your ladyship.

42:19.746 --> 42:22.372
- I've only just found it, myself.
- CORA: Is it a secret?

42:22.457 --> 42:26.418
- Or could you tell Mr Brocket?
- I'd be glad to, my lady.

42:26.586 --> 42:30.047
He should come and see the rose garden.
He could give us some ideas.

42:30.131 --> 42:34.051
Old Molesley's a champion.
Or he would be, in a fairer world.

42:34.135 --> 42:35.719
Don't you start.

42:35.803 --> 42:38.722
I'm afraid I've been annoying
Cousin Violet on that score.

42:39.140 --> 42:42.059
If Mr Molesley deserves
the first prize for his flowers,

42:42.143 --> 42:45.395
- the judges will give it to him.
- They wouldn't dare.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.564
Really, Robert. You make me so annoyed.

42:47.649 --> 42:49.900
Isn't it possible
I should win the thing on merit?

42:49.984 --> 42:53.570
I think the appropriate answer
to that, Mama, is, "Yes, dear".

42:56.157 --> 42:57.991
I don't know why we're bothering.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.453
- We'll have missed the speeches as it is.
- Don't be such a grouch.

43:01.955 --> 43:05.123
You should have punished
one ofthem at least.

43:05.917 --> 43:09.086
They know that I know,
that's worth something.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.508
What do you think will happen
to Mrs Patmore?

43:14.926 --> 43:17.761
She'll muddle through with Daisy for help.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.847
In the long term, we'll just have to wait
for the doctor to give his opinion.

43:20.932 --> 43:23.517
I hope there's something they can do.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.269
I hope so, too.

43:25.353 --> 43:28.689
But ifthere isn't,
I hope they tell her there isn't.

43:28.815 --> 43:31.900
Nothing is harder to live with
than false hope.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.361
I wish you'd just come out with it.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.406
With what?

43:37.991 --> 43:39.866
Whatever it is you're keeping secret.

43:45.373 --> 43:46.707
I can't.

43:48.710 --> 43:51.878
- You don't deny it, then?
- No, I don't deny it.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.257
And I don't deny you've a right to ask.

43:55.383 --> 43:56.842
But I can't.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.178
I'm not a free man.

44:02.890 --> 44:05.600
Are you trying to tell me
that you're married?

44:05.727 --> 44:09.187
I have been married, yes.
But that's not all of it.

44:09.439 --> 44:10.897
Because...

44:13.067 --> 44:15.402
Because I love you, Mr Bates.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.780
I know it's not ladylike to say it,

44:19.574 --> 44:22.743
but I'm not a lady and I don't pretend to be.

44:26.622 --> 44:30.625
You are a lady to me.
And I never knew a finer one.

44:35.381 --> 44:38.884
Lfyou want a lift,
I can take one ofyou, but not more.

44:38.968 --> 44:41.386
- One ofthe women.
- No, you must go.

44:41.471 --> 44:44.431
- Then we can all hurry and meet you there.
- Yes, you're right.

44:45.099 --> 44:47.142
I mustn't slow you down.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.729
There's been too much ofthat already.

45:12.502 --> 45:14.920
Have you recovered from our ordeal?

45:15.004 --> 45:16.755
I got a letter this morning.

45:16.839 --> 45:20.008
They must have written it
as soon as I left the office.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.927
They are pleased to have met me,

45:22.011 --> 45:27.641
but I do not quite fit their requirements.
So it was all for nothing.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.476
I don't agree.

45:29.602 --> 45:31.853
Only a fool doesn't know
when they've been beaten.

45:31.979 --> 45:35.482
Then I'm a fool, for I'm a long way
from being beaten yet.

45:42.323 --> 45:45.325
When you ran off last night,
I hope you hadn't thought me rude.

45:45.451 --> 45:49.079
Certainly not. I monopolised you at dinner.
I'd no right to any more ofyour time.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.456
You see, Edith and I had this sort of bet...

45:51.541 --> 45:53.542
Please don't apologise.

45:53.876 --> 45:57.671
I had a lovely evening
and I'm glad we're on speaking terms.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.632
Now, I should look after my mother.

46:04.470 --> 46:07.722
Why was Cousin Matthew
in such a hurry to get away?

46:07.849 --> 46:09.474
Don't be stupid.

46:09.559 --> 46:12.811
I suppose you didn't want him
when he wanted you,

46:12.895 --> 46:15.188
and now it's the other way round.

46:15.356 --> 46:17.566
You have to admit it's quite funny.

46:17.692 --> 46:20.110
I'll admit that if I ever wanted
to attract a man

46:20.194 --> 46:23.321
I'd steer clear ofthose clothes and that hat.

46:23.406 --> 46:26.283
You think yourselfso superior, don't you?

46:26.367 --> 46:27.409
(MARY GROANS)

46:34.876 --> 46:39.379
Well, I think she who laughs last
laughs longest.

46:39.881 --> 46:42.299
CORA: Did that missing box ofyours
ever turn up?

46:42.383 --> 46:43.758
It was a fuss about nothing.

46:43.885 --> 46:46.178
They must've put it back on the wrong shelf
when they were dusting.

46:46.262 --> 46:47.929
Bates found it this morning.

46:48.055 --> 46:51.475
Next time, have a proper look
before you start complaining.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.685
I'm sure the servants
were frightened halfto death.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.270
Mea culpa.

47:04.363 --> 47:08.241
And now, the Grantham Cup
for the best bloom in the village.

47:08.784 --> 47:11.745
And the Grantham Cup is awarded to...

47:26.552 --> 47:28.428
Mr William Molesley

47:30.264 --> 47:33.058
for his Comtesse Cabarrus rose.

47:35.645 --> 47:38.730
Bravo! Well done! Bravo!

47:48.616 --> 47:52.410
- Congratulations, Mr Molesley.
- Thank you, my lady.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.621
Thank you for letting me have it.

47:54.747 --> 47:58.083
It is the judges who decide these things,
not me.

47:58.501 --> 48:00.335
But very well done.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.969
Congratulations!

48:10.304 --> 48:13.640
Bravo, Mama.
That must have been a real sacrifice.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.642
And bravely borne.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.727
I don't know what everyone's on about.

48:17.812 --> 48:20.272
- But I...
- All is well, my dear.

48:20.439 --> 48:21.856
All is well.
