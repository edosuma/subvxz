[Adrian] Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager:

00:03.937 --> 00:07.168
- So, first day of school.
- Yep.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.698
And Ashley's first day of school.
Take care of her.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.404
And forget about Ben. For today.

00:11.444 --> 00:15.881
I feel a little funny about giving you
a car if we're not even friends.

00:15.915 --> 00:18.213
What is this, some kind of a bribe?

00:18.251 --> 00:23.587
If that's the way you wanna look at a
brand-spanking-new SUV, I guess it is.

00:23.623 --> 00:27.821
- How are you, Jack?
- Why are you touching my arm like that?

00:27.861 --> 00:31.558
I'm instilling confidence in you as my
patient. Just something doctors do.

00:31.598 --> 00:34.396
I'm Griffin.
You wanna have lunch with me?

00:34.434 --> 00:37.335
- You make it sounds as if it's a date.
- I'm gay.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.701
Maybe we could be friends.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.399
- Do you trust me?
- No.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.498
I don't trust you.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.510
I guess it's just a matter
of not getting caught, isn't it?

00:44.544 --> 00:48.480
We have to find things to do together
with John as a family. I do love you.

00:50.417 --> 00:53.352
- I told Dad about the car.
- Not bribing my daughter with a car.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.752
- I think that's my baby.
- I think it is, too.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.586
- I love you.
- It's too late.

00:57.624 --> 01:00.559
It's never too late. Let me fix it.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.486
I know what this is about.
This is about the car.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.932
No. I thought about it, and I thought
you were right, I was wrong.

01:07.967 --> 01:11.300
- Amy needs a car. Buy her a car.
- I already bought her a car.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.464
I don't need permission to buy a car.

01:13.506 --> 01:17.567
Anne wanted me to wait until she and I
could talk, and it's been a busy week.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.601
- A lease, or did you buy?
- I don't lease.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.410
- Smart. Neither do I.
- Wait. If this isn't about the car...

01:22.449 --> 01:25.714
It isn't about the car.
It's about the baby. My baby.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.586
I know it's your baby. We figured that
out. Are you just now figuring that out?

01:29.622 --> 01:32.591
- No.
- What happened?

01:32.625 --> 01:34.991
- What happened?
- You two haven't said anything

01:35.028 --> 01:36.757
to each other in, what, six months?

01:36.796 --> 01:39.264
Now that the baby is about to be here,
you wanna talk?

01:39.299 --> 01:41.665
- I do.
- There's nothing to talk about.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.169
- I love Anne.
- Anne wants me to break up with you

01:44.204 --> 01:46.570
- because she's having my baby.
- No.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.097
Yeah. I should know,
'cause I put it there.

01:49.142 --> 01:52.669
See, George, right there. That's
exactly what Anne hates about you,

01:52.712 --> 01:56.148
- that crudeness.
- That crudeness got her pregnant.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.582
I know about the night in the garage.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.848
A night in a garage
does not a lifetime make.

02:00.887 --> 02:03.185
What is that,
iambic pentameter or pig Latin?

02:03.223 --> 02:05.350
Neither.

02:05.391 --> 02:07.757
- What about the vasectomy?
- I lied.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.262
She hates that, too, that you lie.

02:10.295 --> 02:14.790
You know what, George? She hates your
sense of humor. It's so pedestrian.

02:14.834 --> 02:17.325
I see. You and Anne,
you're more intellectual equals

02:17.370 --> 02:20.339
than Anne and myself, or Anne and me,
or Anne and I? Enlighten me.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.136
- Let's see...
- I don't really care.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.871
I ain't got no education
so I'll just have to use my brain.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.106
- You graduated from college.
- Not a good one.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.639
I'm surprised Anne would even want you
to have this conversation with me.

02:30.683 --> 02:34.949
You were a sickly child, weren't you?
Spent time in the house with Legos.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.889
You fantasized what life
would be like outside the estate

02:37.924 --> 02:40.688
you grew up in, but you never
found out, so let me tell you.

02:40.727 --> 02:44.663
Life outside those gates is crap
and it's real and it's messy

02:44.697 --> 02:48.531
and you can't plan it and you can't
control it. All you can do is live it.

02:48.568 --> 02:53.198
And you can't live it with my wife
and my daughters and my baby.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.002
You wanna bet?

02:59.546 --> 03:01.241

03:17.030 --> 03:18.964
Are you finished yet?

03:18.998 --> 03:21.364
Nope. Are you finished
with your homework yet?

03:21.401 --> 03:25.929
I've been finished. Dad, just take
a break and go and see the house.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.530
Hurry, you have to hurry.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.008
It'll be gone if George
ever puts it on the market.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.773
Adrian, it's not on the market,
and even if it were,

03:32.812 --> 03:35.076
I don't know if your mother
and I like the house.

03:35.114 --> 03:38.174
You haven't seen the inside of
the house. It's the perfect house.

03:38.218 --> 03:44.214
And you know what they say: It's all
about location, location, location.

03:44.257 --> 03:47.852
- You couldn't get a better location.
- Yeah, for spying on Ricky.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.362
But I don't think that
has much value as far as resale.

03:50.396 --> 03:55.197
Adrian, I have to make
the decisions about buying a home.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.068
- I'm the one who has to pay for it.
- Just take a look at it.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.971
- George won't mind, come on.
- We will look at the house

04:01.007 --> 04:03.737
when the house is on the market.
That's all I can promise.

04:03.776 --> 04:07.473
[Sighs] All right. Then I'm just
gonna go over to Grace's.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.572
- It's a school night.
- We'll do homework.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.084
You said you were finished
with your homework.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.586
OK, I know you're a DA,
but take the night off.

04:14.621 --> 04:18.148
There's no night off
from being your dad.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.317
What are you up to?
Are you going to Ricky's?

04:20.360 --> 04:23.955
I'm going to Grace's house to get away
from you, and we're not doing homework.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.794
Happy?

04:27.066 --> 04:28.897
[Door opens]

04:28.935 --> 04:31.199
- [Door closes]
- [Sighs]

04:32.939 --> 04:35.407
- So your dad's not home?
- No. Sorry, he's not.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.432
He's next door
if you wanna go over there.

04:37.477 --> 04:41.174
Mom doesn't know he's thinking
about selling, so I wouldn't mention it.

04:41.214 --> 04:45.310
No, of course not, but I don't
wanna bother him if he's with your mom.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.411
- Could we wait?
- We don't have to if you don't want us

04:48.454 --> 04:50.684
- or if it's inconvenient...
- I don't care.

04:50.723 --> 04:52.657
- Thanks.
- By the way,

04:52.692 --> 04:56.184
- how are you doing with school, Ashley?
- Personal space alert, Grace.

04:56.229 --> 04:59.096
- I understand.
- [Adrian] Do you mind if I just see

04:59.132 --> 05:01.862
- what the view is like from the window?
- Go ahead.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.664
Ricky and Amy are in the living room.

05:08.274 --> 05:11.175
I don't feel right about this.
We should have called first.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.838
She didn't call last time,
so don't worry about it.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.610
Adrian, you've already seen the house?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.981
- Yeah, I've seen it.
- You told me you never saw it.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.485
I lied.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.988
Are they fighting?

05:29.595 --> 05:31.859
- I know that you know.
- I don't know, Amy.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.366
- You don't know if Ben had sex?
- No.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.891
- I know that you know!
- Hey! Don't do that.

05:36.936 --> 05:37.960
Whoa!

05:38.004 --> 05:40.871
I don't think Ricky would like
if he knew you watched him argue.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.809
I think that's if he knew you two were
watching him argue with Amy. I'm out.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.335
Me, too. Adrian,
we should be ashamed of ourselves.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.076
- Wanna see the rest of the house?
- That's so nice of you.

05:50.116 --> 05:54.143
We were so rude just to just drop in.
I'd love to, yeah. Thanks. Adrian?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.520
- I've seen it!
- I have to know. I have to.

05:57.557 --> 06:02.085
I'm telling you I don't know.
I don't know if Ben had sex or not.

06:02.128 --> 06:05.427
- What makes you think he had sex?
- Because he's acting all grown up

06:05.465 --> 06:09.595
and reasonable. He wants us to find
something we both have in common,

06:09.635 --> 06:12.661
and spend time
doing activities we both enjoy.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.740
He sounds like someone's parent.
He does not sound like my boyfriend.

06:16.776 --> 06:20.405
- My boyfriend, Ben, wanted to have sex.
- So have sex with him.

06:20.446 --> 06:24.075
I don't want to have sex. I wanna know
if he had sex before I waste my time

06:24.117 --> 06:26.278
finding some stupid activity
we both enjoy.

06:26.319 --> 06:30.119
- Wouldn't you both enjoy sex?
- I didn't find sex that much fun.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.523
- Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
- I didn't have fun.

06:33.559 --> 06:39.020
I think you did. And didn't Ben
tell you he didn't have sex?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.657
What else is he gonna tell me?!

06:46.072 --> 06:49.303
- What?
- Nothing.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.277
You do realize that
once your parents buy the house

06:53.312 --> 06:56.645
that you'll break up with Ricky,
and then you won't be able to get away

06:56.682 --> 06:59.116
because he'll be next door
for the next 18 years.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.121
- I don't care.
- So your dad's over there, too?

07:02.155 --> 07:04.146
He and my mom
are fighting in the kitchen,

07:04.190 --> 07:07.557
but we don't have a direct view of the
kitchen so I'm really only guessing

07:07.593 --> 07:11.996
based on what he went over there for.
We all know it's his baby at this point.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.967
- Good. I guess that's good.
- I don't know if it's good.

07:16.002 --> 07:20.268
It's just what is, and there's
nothing anyone can do about what is.

07:20.306 --> 07:23.742
Yeah. I mean,
no matter what happens, life goes on.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.405
Grace, I hope you don't think
I was referring to your dad.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.645
- I'm sorry about your dad.
- No, I didn't think you were.

07:31.684 --> 07:34.744
But I do miss him.
He was a nice man.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.621
- Yeah, that's what I heard.
- He was. And so is your dad.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.889
- I haven't heard that.
- Really?

07:41.928 --> 07:45.625
I think he is. He's kind of a
well-meaning type of guy.

07:45.665 --> 07:50.659
Well-meaning?
Yeah, I guess he's that.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.967
I thought that's what
you wanted me to do. Fix it.

07:53.005 --> 07:56.497
Why would you think I wanted you
to break up with David for me?

07:56.542 --> 07:57.873
That's not fixing things.

07:57.910 --> 08:01.004
You left it up to me to fix things
between us. I was fixing things.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.710
- I did not leave it up to you.
- OK, I took things into my own hands.

08:04.750 --> 08:09.619
- [Sighs] He said, "You wanna bet?"
- He's so cocky.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.623
He's not cocky. He's confident.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.683
One of the things I always liked
about him was he was confident.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.787
- I wonder what he meant by that.
- Yeah, I wonder, too.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.822
He doesn't have a chance. Does he?

08:20.867 --> 08:22.926
I don't know. [sighs]

08:22.969 --> 08:26.063
I thought he'd be more upset,
but he's been fine with me all week.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.902
Honestly, he's more upset with you.

08:27.940 --> 08:31.899
Huh... If he's more upset
with you than he is with me,

08:31.944 --> 08:34.139
- then maybe he really does love me.
- What?

08:34.179 --> 08:37.910
- Maybe I should just stay with him.
- You're having my baby.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.477
I know, but David's told me that he
doesn't care, that he loves me anyway.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.081
- You don't love him!
- I do love him.

08:44.123 --> 08:46.250
I'm just not in love with him.

08:46.292 --> 08:50.285
Honestly, George, I don't know if I'm in
love with you either. I love you, but...

08:50.329 --> 08:52.422
You're in love with me!
You've always been!

08:52.465 --> 08:54.990
Maybe I just love you
like I just love David.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.902
Come on. You would choose that
building-block weenie over me?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.270
I like that building-block weenie.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.605
That's why I went out with him,
because I like him.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.700
- You like him because he likes you.
- So?

09:05.745 --> 09:08.043
A lot of guys would
if you gave them a chance.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.548
I would, if you gave me a chance.
Another chance.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.780
- Maybe I should have dated more.
- You were pregnant when we broke up.

09:13.819 --> 09:16.413
What? Who's gonna
go out with a pregnant woman?

09:16.455 --> 09:18.946
I don't know. David did.
Maybe other men would.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.755
- What?
- I don't know.

09:21.794 --> 09:25.423
Maybe I gave in too easily,
to both you and to David.

09:25.464 --> 09:28.126
Maybe I don't want either one of you.

09:28.167 --> 09:32.763
Maybe the love of my life is still out
there. Maybe I'll fall in love again.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.256
[Dialing]

09:51.290 --> 09:53.884
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.951
I asked you first.
Are you spying on me?

09:55.995 --> 09:59.988
Why would you be spying on me?
I'm just at Amy's, visiting my son.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.056
Uh-huh.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.398
Don't start following me around.
I don't like that.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.428
I'm not following you around.
I was dropping by to see George.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.236
George is with Anne.
Why would you drop by to see George?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.936
- You have a father now.
- Yeah.

10:10.977 --> 10:15.107
- My father is buying George's house.
- What? So you'd be living next to Amy?

10:15.147 --> 10:17.138
Mm-hmm.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.514
- What's she doing here?
- She's looking at our new house.

10:20.553 --> 10:24.011
- Hi, Ricky. We were just leaving.
- Is she kidding?

10:24.056 --> 10:26.854
- About?
- Buying the house?

10:26.892 --> 10:30.350
- I don't think so.
- Where are George and Ashley moving?

10:30.396 --> 10:32.023
Hey, guys.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.130
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

10:36.168 --> 10:38.864
I asked him to pick me up
so Adrian could talk to you.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.201
- [Jack] Hey, Adrian.
- Hi, Jack.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.969
- Ricky.
- Did you know about this?

10:43.009 --> 10:44.340
About?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.709
Adrian's parents
are buying Amy's dad's house.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.907
- That's convenient.
- Convenient for what?

10:48.948 --> 10:52.076
You seeing Adrian
after you see Amy and John?

10:52.118 --> 10:54.678
This will give you two
more time together.

10:55.721 --> 10:58.747
OK, well, this has been fun. Good night.

11:03.796 --> 11:04.820
[Door closes]

11:07.199 --> 11:08.666
Oh!

11:08.701 --> 11:12.034
- Look who's here.
- What's going on?

11:12.071 --> 11:14.801
Did you know Adrian's dad
is buying your dad's house?

11:14.840 --> 11:18.537
- [Scoffs] No, he isn't.
- Yes, he is. Adrian says he is, anyway.

11:18.577 --> 11:20.545
Ridiculous. My dad's not selling.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.207
Your dad is getting
back together with your mom,

11:23.249 --> 11:26.343
so someone's buying the house.
Might as well be my family.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.876
No. No one is buying my dad's house.
He's not moving.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.151
He's certainly not
moving back in with us.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.681
- It's his baby.
- Yeah, so?

11:33.726 --> 11:35.250
So he's moving back over there.

11:35.294 --> 11:40.459
There's not room for him over there.
There's not room for her, either.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.057
Says who?

11:42.301 --> 11:45.270
You could stay with us.
I'd hate for you to have to endure her.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.602
Interesting proposition.
Let me think about it.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.404
You're gonna live with
Adrian and her mom and her dad.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.606
- You're not gonna do that.
- You're not telling me what to do.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.705
No, I'm telling you what to do.

11:55.748 --> 11:59.081
Stay in this house with Dad because
I need your room for the nursery.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.609
Mom can move over there
with you and Dad and her baby,

12:01.654 --> 12:03.417
- if they get back together.
- Right.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.890
- You'd get the whole house?
- I could use a house.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.723
Please, they're not gonna
give you the house. Get real, Amy.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.628
I'm gonna need my room,
John'll move into your room with you.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.531
- He's in there all the time.
- Mom is not getting back with Dad

12:14.567 --> 12:17.593
- because she's having his baby.
- I know what you're thinking.

12:17.636 --> 12:20.628
If you can keep Mom with David awhile,
you can get that new car.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.574
- He's buying you a new car?
- SUV.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.737
It's a bribe. He just wants you
to get your mother to choose him.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.077
- That's not gonna happen, is it?
- Probably not.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.276
Butt out. My SUV
is none of your business.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.649
- You butt out.
- I wasn't butting in.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.712
Butting in about the house.
If Dad wants to sell the house, he can.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.020
- Mom's not gonna let him!
- Guys.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.492
You think you know everything
'cause you had a baby.

12:41.527 --> 12:45.759
- No, I don't. Do I, Ricky?
- Kind of.

12:45.798 --> 12:46.958
[Laughs]

12:46.999 --> 12:49.399
Thanks a lot, Mr. Father of My Baby.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.130
Ricky is the father of my baby,
and he not moving in with us.

12:55.174 --> 12:58.905
So why would my dad move back
into the house with my mom

12:58.944 --> 13:00.935
just because he's
the father of her baby?

13:07.286 --> 13:11.814
[Laughs] You know, actually,
this is kind of fun,

13:11.857 --> 13:14.587
everyone in my future kitchen
all together like this.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.494
- No, it isn't.
- Well, I think it is.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.159
I can't wait to move in. Good night.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.365
I do not want Adrian
living next door to Amy.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.533
She'll catch you
lying about where you are?

13:29.575 --> 13:32.703
- You think I'm afraid of her?
- Ah. Question, not an answer.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.713
I don't care if she catches me cheating.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.612
I wish she would.
She'd break up with me.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.846
That why you want her to catch you?
You want her to break up with you,

13:39.885 --> 13:43.048
or you just want her to somehow
stop you from cheating on her?

13:43.088 --> 13:44.453
I can't stop.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.549
You can do a lot
you never thought you could.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.526
- Like what?
- You never thought

13:48.561 --> 13:50.552
you could be a good father, but you are.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.227
Maybe you could be
a good guy for a change.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.724
- Maybe I don't want to.
- Maybe you do.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.674
You're late. Bye.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.874
Fortunately, the judge
has an appointment,

14:09.915 --> 14:12.076
- so we're starting late.
- Have a nice day.

14:12.117 --> 14:15.917
You, too. I'm working
on finding us a house, Adrian.

14:15.955 --> 14:20.085
- I am, promise.
- Thanks. I'm sure you are.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.753
- I am.
- Bye.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.695
Bye.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.631
[Phone rings]

14:27.666 --> 14:29.190
- Hello?
- Ruben, it's George.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.102
Adrian gave me your number.
You're in the market for my house?

14:32.137 --> 14:34.867
- Is your house on the market?
- It might be.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.499
- Might?
- Is.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.567
I guess Adrian came by there last night.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.273
Yeah, I guess she did.
She's a smart girl, that Adrian.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.611
She just wants the house
so she can spy on Ricky.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.810
She can spy,
she's not gonna see anything.

14:45.851 --> 14:48.877
- He's not doing anything with Amy.
- Is he with anyone else?

14:48.921 --> 14:51.219
- How would I know?
- You know.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.522
You answered the question with
a question. He's cheating on Adrian?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.551
He might be.
You wanna see the house or not?

14:56.595 --> 14:59.462
- Again, the question.
- How would I know if Ricky is cheating?

14:59.498 --> 15:02.023
You sure he and Amy
aren't doing anything?

15:02.067 --> 15:05.662
Having Adrian next door would stop them?
Is that what this is about?

15:05.704 --> 15:09.435
Ricky and Amy? Come on. Amy? She's
never gonna go near that guy again.

15:09.475 --> 15:13.206
- Are you interested in the house?
- Yeah, I guess so.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.907
We haven't found anything
in the school district.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.143
But I'd like to see it before I buy it.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.708
- Great. When do you wanna see it?
- When can I see it?

15:20.819 --> 15:23.447
- Whenever you want.
- I got a little time this morning,

15:23.489 --> 15:26.652
- but Cindy won't be back till tonight.
- Take a look at it first,

15:26.692 --> 15:28.785
and if you hate it,
tell her I'm not selling.

15:28.827 --> 15:32.923
- No harm, no foul. Just between us.
- No foul? We'd be lying.

15:32.965 --> 15:36.093
But I'll be there in 15 minutes.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.126
- Thanks, George.
- You're welcome.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.207
Ricky and Amy? Nah.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.573
Hey, Amy said Mom wants you
to take us to school.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.204
I can't. Your mom will have to.
I'm showing the house.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.612
Shouldn't you make sure
you have a place to live?

15:49.648 --> 15:52.742
I'm going back whether Mom
likes it or not. I'm gonna be a daddy.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.754
- And a husband?
- Yeah. Sure, we'll get married again.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.449
- Of course we will.
- [Door opens]

16:00.092 --> 16:01.992
Good morning.
Go back to the house.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.518
Your mother has to take you.
I'm showing the house.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.531
- To?
- Someone who wants to buy it.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.159
Dad, you cannot sell
this house to Adrian's parents.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.135
I can sell this house
to whomever I want.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.899
I'm not sure Mom'll let you back in.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.168
- Where are you gonna go?
- She'll let me back in.

16:15.207 --> 16:16.731
- No, she won't.
- She will.

16:16.775 --> 16:20.267
And don't take David's side. I already
told him he could give you the car.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.007
- Really?
- Really.

16:22.047 --> 16:25.107
- Thanks.
- Amy, even if Dad says he can,

16:25.150 --> 16:27.618
David's not gonna give you the car
once Mom breaks up with him.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.644
Maybe she's not gonna
break up with him.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.486
Mom's not gonna marry David
and move into the Big Green House

16:32.524 --> 16:35.493
and become some environmental
expert married to an architect

16:35.527 --> 16:38.621
- who worships her. That was a dream.
- She's got her dream catcher,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.029
- so you never know.
- Clever.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.226
- Shut up.
- You two miss each other, don't you?

16:42.267 --> 16:44.667
- [Both] No.
- [George] You're not fooling me.

16:44.703 --> 16:47.763
You want your mother and me back
together, all of us under one roof

16:47.806 --> 16:50.104
with the new baby
like nothing ever happened.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.576
Now who's dreaming?
She's not gonna take you back

16:52.611 --> 16:56.172
because she's having your baby.
Mom can take care of a baby by herself,

16:56.215 --> 16:58.410
without you, without David,
without anyone.

16:58.450 --> 17:02.978
Yeah, just like you can take care of a
baby without Ricky or Ben or Mom or Dad

17:03.022 --> 17:06.013
or me or anyone else.
You're doing it all by yourself, too.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.923
I did pretty well by myself this summer.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.928
I bet Ricky was over there every night.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.227
Yeah, for an hour. The rest of the time,
I did everything myself.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.492
An hour? Come on.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.058
He never kept you company
while Mom was with David?

17:17.102 --> 17:19.093
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
- Did he?

17:20.271 --> 17:25.436
- Where's the baby? Where's John?
- Oh, no!

17:27.413 --> 17:31.144
Tell me something. Ricky and Amy, this
summer, you think he stayed all night?

17:31.183 --> 17:32.980
- What do you think?
- He might've,

17:33.018 --> 17:36.317
but they would never have sex
or anything like that, would they?

17:36.355 --> 17:38.823
- What's anything like sex?
- Answer the question.

17:38.857 --> 17:42.884
I don't know. Amy thought that
Ben was having sex, so she might have.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.897
- What?!
- We were away, so who knows.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.991
It's definitely a possibility
at some point.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.730
But it's less of a possibility
if Adrian's living here.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.105
Yeah. You're smart.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.940
- Who are you looking for?
- You. I was looking for you.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.746
Didn't you hear me yelling for you
when we left the field?

18:06.785 --> 18:10.186
Uh, I did. But I didn't feel like
talking to you in front of everyone.

18:10.222 --> 18:14.056
- What do you want?
- Adrian, I have to tell you something.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.493
No, you don't.
You don't have to tell me anything.

18:16.528 --> 18:19.691
- I think I do.
- No. Not now. Not anytime.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.529
- I don't want to know. Ever.
- Well, you're gonna know,

18:22.568 --> 18:25.128
so I'm gonna tell you.
And if you don't wanna know,

18:25.170 --> 18:28.071
why would you go to all the trouble
to have your dad buy a house

18:28.107 --> 18:30.200
just so you can spy on me?

18:31.877 --> 18:35.176
- Ben!
- Oh! Hey, guys. What's up?

18:35.214 --> 18:36.841
- You're here early.
- Yeah.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.578
I just wanted to get a book
from the library. Cribbage.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.451
I learned to play this summer.
Hopefully, Amy likes it.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.513
Do you mind?
I was trying to talk to Adrian.

18:44.556 --> 18:48.549
You know, we can talk later. So how
are you, Ben? How are you and Amy?

18:48.594 --> 18:51.154
We're good.
Friday night date night tonight.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.255
So you worked everything out,
you and Amy?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.994
- Who cares?
- We did, actually. Yeah, thank you.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.764
It was a little rocky at first,
but now we're fine.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.635
And tonight, cribbage.

19:00.672 --> 19:04.130
Which, hopefully, will become
a pastime for a lifetime.

19:04.176 --> 19:07.407
- Wait, so, cribbage. What is that?
- Adrian, I don't care

19:07.446 --> 19:09.676
and you don't care.
I doubt if Amy even cares.

19:09.715 --> 19:13.378
You know what? Amy thinks this whole
find-something-in-common routine

19:13.418 --> 19:15.784
is a cover for your trying
to be interested in her.

19:15.821 --> 19:20.019
But you're not because you had sex with
some other girl or girls this summer.

19:20.058 --> 19:23.994
She's hounding me to tell her that
you had sex with some girl or girls.

19:24.029 --> 19:27.294
- So why don't you just tell her.
- Because I didn't.

19:27.332 --> 19:32.133
And even if he did,
he shouldn't tell Amy,

19:32.171 --> 19:37.575
because if he does, she will
never ever feel the same for him.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.513
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Nothing is going on.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.813
Nothing that anyone
wants to know, anyway.

19:51.990 --> 19:55.255
- I almost left John at home.
- Hey. Good morning.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.023
I almost left John at home.

19:57.062 --> 20:01.465
I had the baby seat and the baby bag
and the baby everything else,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.730
but I didn't have the baby.

20:03.769 --> 20:09.366
I'm losing it with everything going on
between my dad and my mom and babies.

20:09.408 --> 20:14.209
I still can't believe she's
having a baby. It's unbelievable.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.847
Maybe I slept five minutes last night.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.750
I can barely keep my eyes open.

20:21.787 --> 20:24.381
Did you ask Ricky
if I had sex this summer?

20:24.423 --> 20:27.290
- What?
- Is that a yes?

20:27.326 --> 20:29.760
- No.
- Amy, I love you.

20:29.795 --> 20:34.357
I really love you.
And I only wanna be with you.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.889
For the rest of my life.

20:38.036 --> 20:43.440
I'm sorry, Ben.
I just get so jealous of you,

20:43.475 --> 20:47.571
and wondering what happened
this summer is making me crazy.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.714
- What?
- Amy, I didn't do anything.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.083
- I'm wondering why you're so jealous.
- Because I love you!

20:55.120 --> 20:57.111
I really love you.

20:57.155 --> 21:00.613
And I only want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.651
- OK.
- OK?

21:03.695 --> 21:07.461
Yeah. It's just... that was my answer.

21:07.499 --> 21:10.127
Your answer was good enough for me,
why not for you?

21:10.168 --> 21:15.231
- I caught Ricky sleeping at your house.
- We are not going back to this, are we?

21:15.274 --> 21:20.473
No, we're not. We're not. So, hey,
ready to play a little cribbage?

21:20.512 --> 21:23.174
- Can't wait.
- You'll love it.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.615
- Yeah, sure.
- If you don't want to play cribbage,

21:25.651 --> 21:28.916
maybe Ricky could take John tonight
and we could do something else.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.946
- Like?
- Like go out to dinner

21:31.990 --> 21:35.790
and then make out in the car
for an hour or two.

21:35.827 --> 21:39.456
Or, again, we could play cribbage.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.162
It's a nice house.
It's perfect for Adrian's family.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.000
That would be crazy, wouldn't it?
If Adrian and her family

21:47.039 --> 21:49.473
moved in next to Amy
so she could spy on him?

21:49.508 --> 21:53.842
It's not so she can spy on him. She's in
love with him. She wants to be near him.

21:53.879 --> 21:58.009
She wants to be around John.
Ricky won't let her around John.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.450
It could be a good thing
for everyone, the family.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.385
Could be a chance
to forgive and forget.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.787
- Forgive and forget?
- That Mr. Juergens cheated

22:04.823 --> 22:08.884
- on Mrs. Juergens with Adrian's mom.
- Didn't Mrs. Juergens also cheat?

22:08.927 --> 22:12.693
- No. That was my mom.
- No, it was Amy's mom, too.

22:12.731 --> 22:16.724
She has that boyfriend everyone thought
got her pregnant, only he didn't.

22:16.768 --> 22:19.134
- She cheated before the boyfriend?
- What I heard.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.365
- From?
- Madison.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.202
- Madison?
- Yeah, Madison.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.800
- When did you talk to Madison?
- Last summer.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.937
- Did you see Madison a lot last summer?
- It was nothing.

22:27.979 --> 22:30.140
We had a few meetings
of the Dead Parents Club.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.744
Without me and without Ben? Just you
and Madison? How many is a few?

22:34.786 --> 22:38.313
Three? Four? I don't know. I spent
most of my summer on the field.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.655
You didn't spend
your summer playing the field?

22:40.692 --> 22:43.559
- What?
- You never said anything about Madison.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.529
- I didn't?
- No, you didn't.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.863
I told you Jason broke up with her,
you acted like you didn't know. Did you?

22:48.900 --> 22:52.028
Um... Yeah. I think I did,
I just didn't care.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.039
I guess I forgot. Maybe
I got hit in the head too many times.

22:55.073 --> 22:58.065
You been doing those groin
exercises I told the coach about?

22:58.110 --> 23:00.340
- The whole team's been doing them.
- Good.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.371
- Good?
- Have an urge to inflict groin injury.

23:03.415 --> 23:08.944
Wait, wait, wait. You?
You, Dr. Grace Bowman, are jealous?

23:10.489 --> 23:14.516
I kinda like that.
Makes you less doctor and more woman.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.660
- Ben! Hey, wait up!
- Hi, Grace. What's up?

23:21.700 --> 23:23.930
I was wondering
if you wanted to get together,

23:23.969 --> 23:26.904
since we didn't see each other
all summer and Jack and Madison

23:26.938 --> 23:29.702
- went on with Dead Parents meetings.
- Really? They did?

23:29.741 --> 23:33.837
Yeah, they did. So I didn't know
if you wanted to get together,

23:33.879 --> 23:37.645
just the two of us, and talk about our
dead parents without Jack or Madison.

23:37.682 --> 23:40.378
Uh... Yeah.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.321
Yeah, that would be interesting.
Just let me know when. See ya.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.380
Bye.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.895
You don't want to come to my house
and watch Twilight Zone.

23:54.933 --> 23:58.664
No, of course not. I wanna
see your crazy family in action.

23:58.703 --> 24:02.139
Everyone else gets to come over.
Come on. What, are you ashamed of me?

24:02.174 --> 24:05.769
Yeah, I would be ashamed to have you as
my friend when I lived with my family.

24:05.811 --> 24:09.406
Hey. I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm Mark.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.075
Hi, Mark.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.210
Bye, Mark. Get away.
She's not interested.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.755
OK, I admit, he was kind of tempting,
so I guess I owe you.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.356
- You can come over.
- You do owe me.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.230
Don't you have a guy to go out with?

24:29.267 --> 24:31.963
I thought we made a pact:
No dating in high school.

24:32.003 --> 24:35.700
- Well, pacts can be broken.
- Yeah, well, not tonight.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.038
I'll drop by at what?
Eight? 8:30? Nine?

24:38.076 --> 24:42.809
Hi. I don't think we've met before.
I just wanted to introduce myself.

24:43.882 --> 24:47.113
- To her or to me?
- To you.

24:47.152 --> 24:51.486
- We'll talk later.
- What, after high school?

24:51.523 --> 24:55.789
- No dating in high school, remember?
- Yeah, I forgot.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.319
- So nine?
- Yeah, OK.

25:03.635 --> 25:07.264
- Hey, Ricky, can we talk?
- About?

25:07.305 --> 25:09.830
This is kind of awkward.
It's about Adrian.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.342
What about Adrian?

25:11.376 --> 25:14.209
I was just wondering,
are you two together or not?

25:14.246 --> 25:16.737
- Why do you want to know?
- Why do I want to know?

25:19.017 --> 25:20.177
Never mind.

25:26.825 --> 25:29.419
We're home!

25:29.461 --> 25:31.827
You like coming over
to Daddy's house, don't you?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.956
[John cooing]

25:33.999 --> 25:35.933
[Ricky laughs]

25:35.967 --> 25:39.061
Come on, let's put you
in your high chair.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.801
Here you go.

25:44.142 --> 25:47.441
And you can drum
while Daddy heats up your bottle.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.073
[Phone rings]

25:57.088 --> 25:58.453
Come on. You try.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.988
- [Laughing]
- [Cooing]

26:06.197 --> 26:10.190
- Not going out tonight?
- Maybe later.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.398
Maybe later if Ricky calls you later?

26:15.407 --> 26:19.309
- What is that?
- That is how things are right now.

26:19.344 --> 26:23.280
Adrian, your father wants me to take
a look at George's house tonight.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.442
- Great.
- Great?

26:25.483 --> 26:30.284
Yeah. Only because it's a great house
and it's in my school district.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.984
I'm not interested
in spying on Ricky anymore.

26:33.024 --> 26:36.755
- Because?
- Because I don't have to.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.423
- I already know he's cheating on me.
- He told you that?

26:39.464 --> 26:42.297
- No.
- Then what makes you think that?

26:42.334 --> 26:45.735
He tried to tell me he cheated on me.

26:51.643 --> 26:54.305
Haven't you two
always cheated on each other?

26:54.346 --> 26:58.544
Yeah, but this time it's different.

26:58.583 --> 27:00.551
This time, I really care about him.

27:00.585 --> 27:03.053
If you care about him,
why would you cheat on him?

27:03.088 --> 27:04.783
Because he cheats on me.

27:04.823 --> 27:07.053
If you already know,
why would he tell you?

27:07.092 --> 27:09.458
He wants me to know
so I'll break up with him.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.429
- So you can break up with him?
- Why else would he want me to know?

27:12.464 --> 27:17.333
I don't know! Maybe because
he regrets doing whatever he did,

27:17.369 --> 27:20.463
and he's decided he wants to have
an honest relationship with you?

27:20.505 --> 27:21.597
Ricky?

27:25.543 --> 27:28.979
Maybe it's time you and Ricky
both admit that you love each other.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.547
Maybe it's time you and Ricky both admit
that even though you love each other,

27:34.586 --> 27:37.953
you cheat on each other
because you're afraid to be loved.

27:37.989 --> 27:42.119
- Why would we be afraid to be loved?
- Because you're afraid of being hurt.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.927
So you just hurt each other
and you hurt yourselves

27:46.965 --> 27:49.456
because you know that's
how it's going to be anyway.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.628
You think that's what we're doing?

27:51.670 --> 27:55.629
- I think it's a possibility.
- Really?

27:57.208 --> 27:59.073
Been there.

27:59.844 --> 28:03.075
Sorry. Had to take a call.
Going with us, Adrian?

28:03.114 --> 28:05.878
No, I've seen the house.
Is George gonna be there?

28:05.917 --> 28:08.852
George is leaving it unlocked
so we can take a look without him.

28:10.388 --> 28:11.946
Not a bad guy, George.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.857
I could live next door
to him without being too jealous.

28:16.194 --> 28:19.163
I hope I can live next to Amy
without being too jealous.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.665
Tell me you're not
changing your mind at this point.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.567
No, she's not.

28:25.937 --> 28:27.063
Talk to Ricky.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.591
I missed you this summer. I missed this.

28:57.435 --> 29:00.802
I did, too. But remember,
this is as far as we're going.

29:00.839 --> 29:04.366
This is fine with me.
I could do this all night.

29:07.679 --> 29:10.307
- [Knocking]
- Who could that be?

29:10.348 --> 29:14.148
Oh. I told a friend of mine
she could drop by. Can you get it?

29:14.185 --> 29:17.382
- Yeah, I guess. If I have to.
- OK. Thanks.

29:22.761 --> 29:27.164
- Hey, Madison. Come on in.
- Hey, Grace. Hey, Jack.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.635
I invited her. I thought we'd have
a Dead Parents Club meeting

29:31.669 --> 29:33.660
even though Ben is out with Amy tonight.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.731
- Sorry if we left you out this summer.
- We?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.175
It's OK, Madison.
I felt kind of jealous at first,

29:39.210 --> 29:42.111
but I'm glad we talked.
I don't wanna be jealous of anyone.

29:42.147 --> 29:45.082
- Jealous of her?
- It did make me feel good

29:45.116 --> 29:49.450
that you were jealous of me,
especially with Jason and I breaking up.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.684
- I just feel like such a loser.
- You and Jason broke up?

29:52.724 --> 29:56.182
Jack, it's OK. I know you two talked
about Jason and everything else.

29:56.227 --> 30:00.061
I know that losing a boyfriend,
any kind of loss, takes you right back

30:00.098 --> 30:03.898
to that feeling of loss and death
and all those bad things, Madison.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.994
Yeah, unfortunately.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.938
[Grace] I was jealous you didn't tell me
the you two were talking.

30:08.973 --> 30:12.739
Madison is beautiful and smart, and I
don't want you to be interested in her,

30:12.777 --> 30:14.938
but the three of us
should try to be friends,

30:14.979 --> 30:17.743
just like Adrian and Ricky
and Amy are trying to be friends.

30:17.782 --> 30:22.549
- I don't think that's gonna happen.
- It could happen. God willing.

30:24.389 --> 30:28.485
- Even then.
- It could still work. It could.

30:28.526 --> 30:31.859
It could, but I'm having a baby.

30:31.896 --> 30:34.091
George's baby.

30:34.132 --> 30:36.623
We both know that you didn't
really wanna marry me.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.899
You were willing to marry me,
and I love you for that.

30:39.938 --> 30:43.567
You're really the nicest guy, David.

30:43.608 --> 30:47.772
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- We could still work together.

30:47.812 --> 30:50.713
- Really?
- Would that make you happy?

30:50.748 --> 30:53.649
Yeah, make me really happy.

30:53.685 --> 30:58.281
Well, then I don't know why we couldn't
continue working together. Let's do it.

30:58.323 --> 31:01.315
Yeah, let's.

31:01.359 --> 31:06.296
- Thanks. Wow.
- I'm still gonna move to the house.

31:06.331 --> 31:11.633
I wish it was gonna be the three of us,
but if it's not, I'm still gonna move.

31:11.669 --> 31:15.105
You can work out of the office
I have here when you're ready.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.107
I'm only gonna be
in there once in a while.

31:17.141 --> 31:20.941
- So you're moving anyway?
- Yeah, I am.

31:20.979 --> 31:23.675
I need to make a change in my life.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.775
I wish that we were
making it together, but...

31:26.818 --> 31:29.309
- But we're not.
- Do yourself a favor.

31:30.054 --> 31:35.219
Don't just go back with George.
Have the baby. See what happens.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.058
Don't get married again
if you don't wanna get married.

31:38.096 --> 31:42.294
You don't have to marry George again.
You can do whatever you want.

31:42.333 --> 31:47.396
After the baby comes, and you're feeling
ready to taking on a project or two,

31:47.438 --> 31:51.465
- call me, OK?
- Thanks, David, that's unbelievable.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.103
And I will. I will definitely call you.

31:54.145 --> 31:57.308
And I'm sorry that Amy's
not here to say goodbye.

31:57.348 --> 32:00.875
She and Ben got to go out
because Ricky took John for tonight.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.479
I'll just have
to talk to her another time.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.751
That's something else
I'm gonna have to face.

32:05.790 --> 32:08.350
Amy and I just were never
really that close.

32:08.393 --> 32:11.590
And Ashley, I hardly even know Ashley.

32:11.629 --> 32:15.326
- So about the car...
- You're not giving Amy an SUV.

32:15.366 --> 32:17.527
- That was a crazy idea.
- You're right.

32:17.568 --> 32:22.369
So I'm gonna give it to you, and if you
wanna give it to her, give it to her.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.500
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

32:24.542 --> 32:29.605
I'm gonna leave before you can say
anything, so... I will see you around.

32:29.647 --> 32:31.706
- Call me.
- Wait. David, you can't.

32:31.749 --> 32:35.685
I didn't pay you anything for your input
on the house that we renovated together.

32:35.720 --> 32:39.315
You didn't get anything
for all your hard work, so take the car.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.154
Please, take the car.

32:47.899 --> 32:51.266
Goodbye, Anne. I'll see you later.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.599
Good luck with the baby.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.305
Bye, David.

33:07.151 --> 33:12.453
- Hey, how'd it go?
- It went really well.

33:12.991 --> 33:18.122
After the baby comes, Anne's gonna
call me and go back to work with me.

33:18.162 --> 33:23.964
I decided to give her the new car. She
decides if she wants Amy to drive it.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.630
Night, George.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.506
Oh. And there wasn't any time limit
on that bet, was there?

33:39.384 --> 33:42.012
[Knocking]

33:45.656 --> 33:48.022
- Hi.
- John's here.

33:48.059 --> 33:50.357
Oh. I didn't know you had John tonight.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.523
But how would I
since you wouldn't take my calls?

33:53.564 --> 33:56.192
You wouldn't talk at school,
so why should I talk to you?

33:56.234 --> 34:00.364
Would it be possible
for me to actually come inside?

34:00.405 --> 34:03.806
I know you don't want me
around John, for whatever reason,

34:03.841 --> 34:06.241
but I promise I won't go near him.

34:07.779 --> 34:11.442
I think, maybe, we should talk.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.541
At least, I hope
you still wanna talk to me.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.643
You wanna come in, come in.

34:23.928 --> 34:27.920
- He's cute. He looks like you.
- You think so?

34:27.965 --> 34:30.092
Everyone thinks
he looks more like Amy.

34:30.134 --> 34:33.262
Really? No, I don't.

34:33.304 --> 34:37.263
So, what did you wanna tell me?

34:38.708 --> 34:41.199
- Nothing.
- No?

34:41.245 --> 34:45.579
No. What'd you
come over here to tell me?

34:45.616 --> 34:48.050
Nothing.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.078
Friend of yours stopped me
in the hallway at school today.

34:51.121 --> 34:54.819
Well, no friends of yours stopped me
in the hallway at school today,

34:54.859 --> 34:57.293
and yet I know you have friends, too.

34:58.863 --> 35:01.229
Is there any way you and I
could see each other

35:01.265 --> 35:03.927
without having any friends?

35:03.968 --> 35:08.268
'Cause I just want a chance to see if
there really is anything real between us

35:08.306 --> 35:10.240
without always trying to even the score.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.175
I told you I didn't want you
to see other guys, Adrian.

35:13.211 --> 35:17.705
You said Ben and Jack.
But I knew what you meant.

35:17.748 --> 35:20.842
And you were and still are
seeing other girls, Ricky.

35:20.885 --> 35:24.321
- That's how I am.
- And that's how I am.

35:24.355 --> 35:27.017
But what I'm asking is...

35:27.058 --> 35:29.891
Is it possible that
we could be some other way?

35:30.728 --> 35:32.958
Is it possible for us to be different?

35:32.997 --> 35:35.557
Is it possible for us to change?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.830
Because I know
you have to care about me

35:37.869 --> 35:41.202
because you don't usually go back
to the same bed over and over again.

35:42.340 --> 35:46.174
I know I'm the one
you always come back to.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.179
And this time,
I wanna be the one you never leave.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.545
Never?

35:51.582 --> 35:54.710
Adrian, we're in high school.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.344
And I'm me.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.891
Ames?

36:13.171 --> 36:17.107
Oh, no. Am I asleep?

36:17.141 --> 36:18.802
You were, yeah.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.937
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.537
It's not OK.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.443
Thank you for always being
so understanding.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.888
I'm not always so understanding.

36:32.924 --> 36:36.883
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.555
When aren't you understanding?

36:38.596 --> 36:41.759
I feel like there's some
unfinished business about this summer,

36:41.799 --> 36:43.733
and I just wanna clear the air.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.731
Ben, you know Ricky
was over every day this summer.

36:49.774 --> 36:51.935
He's been over every day
since John was born.

36:51.976 --> 36:54.376
That's not exactly where I was headed,

36:54.412 --> 36:59.850
but... Did Ricky ever sleep over again,

36:59.884 --> 37:02.785
other than the time
that I caught him sleeping over?

37:02.820 --> 37:04.981
- What?
- I'm sorry.

37:05.022 --> 37:09.118
I've been thinking about that all night.
And that was a "what," not a "no."

37:09.160 --> 37:11.458
Yes.

37:11.495 --> 37:17.092
- He did sleep over. Sleep.
- All right. It's good to know.

37:19.136 --> 37:20.797
Did you have sex this summer?

37:21.839 --> 37:24.239
- [Sighs heavily] No.
- You didn't?

37:24.275 --> 37:27.039
No.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.673
You know, Ben, I used to think
that you would never lie to me.

37:30.715 --> 37:33.240
And now, for some reason,
I'm just not so sure.

37:35.119 --> 37:39.488
All right, Amy. I lied. Confession.

37:41.192 --> 37:45.185
No, no. Adrian told me that Ricky
slept over a few times this summer,

37:45.229 --> 37:48.164
and you never told me.
I've been waiting for you to tell me.

37:48.199 --> 37:51.134
Have you? That's what's
been bugging you all summer?

37:51.168 --> 37:53.659
Yeah, that's one thing.

37:53.704 --> 37:58.437
So I guess Ricky told Adrian
and Adrian told you?

37:58.476 --> 38:00.000
Yes.

38:00.044 --> 38:03.309
He promised he wouldn't
say anything to anyone.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.913
- Are these wings paid for?
- Uh-huh.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.977
- I wanna go.
- All right. I'll take you home.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.184
I don't wanna go home. I wanna
go over to Ricky's and get my son.

38:13.224 --> 38:15.988
- Amy.
- I hate him.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.722
And I hate her, Adrian!

38:21.899 --> 38:24.197
You tell Ruben and Cindy
they can spend the night?

38:24.235 --> 38:27.568
No. But this is a good thing.
It means they want the house.

38:27.605 --> 38:30.870
I should be getting an offer any minute,
I'm the owner, no commission.

38:30.908 --> 38:33.103
It's a beautiful thing.

38:33.744 --> 38:34.972
[Knocking on window]

38:36.247 --> 38:38.807
- [George] We know him?
- Kind of. Roll down the window.

38:38.849 --> 38:42.285
Hi. I'm Griffin, Ashley's friend.

38:42.320 --> 38:46.347
- Her gay friend.
- Really? You're gay? Hallelujah.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.790
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.626
- You could have told me.
- Using me as the fake boyfriend, huh?

38:52.663 --> 38:55.393
- No, just a fake friend.
- We're friends.

38:55.433 --> 38:58.834
I know you never had one before,
but we're friends. Take my word for it.

38:58.869 --> 39:02.202
- Mm-hmm. We'll see.
- I'm looking after her, Mr. Juergens.

39:02.239 --> 39:06.141
- Every guy in that school wants Ashley.
- That's not what I want to hear.

39:06.177 --> 39:10.136
It's the truth. But, don't worry,
I won't let anyone near her.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.978
- I'm a black belt.
- No kidding?

39:12.016 --> 39:14.746
Nah, I'm kidding. But still,
I am looking after her.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.310
- I'll call you if I sense any trouble.
- Good man.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.290
We're gonna be friends,
at least for the next four years.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.220
So what are we doing?

39:23.260 --> 39:27.253
My dad's just letting a couple
look at the house, Adrian's parents,

39:27.298 --> 39:32.258
and we were waiting for my mom's
boyfriend to leave, but he left already.

39:32.303 --> 39:35.830
- Wow! So I missed the good part?
- No, not really.

39:35.873 --> 39:40.936
This pretty much the way you pictured
Friday night dates in high school?

39:40.978 --> 39:44.709
Sitting in the driveway in your car
with your gay friend and your dad?

39:44.749 --> 39:48.185
I've learnt to have no expectations
and no disappointments.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.617
And at least I'm not having a baby.

39:56.994 --> 39:59.258
[John cooing]

39:59.296 --> 40:03.198
- You look really comfortable with him.
- I wanna have a baby someday.

40:03.234 --> 40:07.568
But not anytime soon. I wanna go to
college and then work at my career,

40:07.605 --> 40:11.063
and then get married
and then have a baby.

40:11.108 --> 40:14.043
- Yeah, good plan. Stick to it.
- It's kind of hard.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.775
I think about getting pregnant sometimes
just to compete with Amy.

40:17.815 --> 40:21.478
But, don't worry, I'm smart enough
to know that not getting pregnant

40:21.519 --> 40:24.613
is the way to compete with Amy.
Don't think you'd go for this twice.

40:24.655 --> 40:28.523
- You're right.
- [Knock on door]

40:28.559 --> 40:30.754
[Amy] Ricky, open up. It's me

40:32.830 --> 40:34.695
[knocking]

40:37.301 --> 40:40.600
- You put him down this minute.
- Don't get upset. I was holding him.

40:42.072 --> 40:45.132
You are never
bringing him over here again.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.940
- Thanks for calling.
- Sorry. She insisted.

40:47.978 --> 40:50.776
You can take him home,
but he's coming over here again.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.477
Adrian can hold my son
if and when I want her to hold him.

40:53.517 --> 40:55.951
- I don't want that... that...
- Slut?

40:55.986 --> 40:58.318
Yeah, that's the one.
I don't want that...

40:58.355 --> 41:00.550
- Slut.
...touching my baby.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.730
And you're not going
to move into my dad's house.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.790
I am not going
to be living next door to you.

41:11.068 --> 41:15.164
I'm afraid you are. My dad called.
Your dad accepted the offer.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.664
