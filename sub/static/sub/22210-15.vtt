00:01.960 --> 00:06.170
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.256 --> 00:09.124
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.218 --> 00:12.211
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S. T.A.R. Labs</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:15.047
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:17.348
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:20.177
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:23.559
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.649 --> 00:26.107
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

00:26.193 --> 00:28.310
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.488 --> 00:30.979
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.073 --> 00:33.656
The Quark Sphere, filled with
Barry's unique genetic marker,

00:33.742 --> 00:35.483
and programmed to track his specific DNA

00:35.577 --> 00:37.364
using the electrical current
of the Speed Force.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.411
Once we track Barry
and we pull him out,

00:39.498 --> 00:41.740
the Quark Sphere will trick
the Speed Force

00:41.833 --> 00:42.823
into thinking he's still there.

00:42.918 --> 00:43.999
What's happening?

00:44.086 --> 00:46.999
We're moving so quickly
that everyone else is still.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.126
- Flash?
- Flash.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.707
I'm your father's doppelganger.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.090
- Jesse, you're a speedster.
<i>- Yeah. It's pretty cool, right?</i>

00:55.180 --> 00:56.466
- Everything okay with Jesse?
- Yes.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.391
I just spent the summer
assembling a support staff for her,

00:59.476 --> 01:01.433
but then Jesse goes
and kicks me off the team.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.977
They took a vote, I'm out.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.599
I don't even have
a home to return to now.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.671
- Oh, Barry. What...
- Iris.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.015
- I'm...
- You're moving with me, okay.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.512
- What?
- You're moving as fast as I am,

01:42.603 --> 01:43.844
like in the courtroom.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.927
Why? Didn't you...

01:46.148 --> 01:49.482
- I can't. I can't.
- What's wrong? What?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.478
I can't save us this time.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.662
Ready when you are, Barry.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.964
<i>- I'm ready.</i>
- Are you serious?

02:13.050 --> 02:15.337
Come on, Cisco, just one more.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.884
"She said, two hours ago."

02:16.970 --> 02:19.587
Look, you know he's not gonna stop
until he makes it through.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.631
Come on. You know how Barry gets.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.224
- One more.
- Thank you.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.427
All right. Here we go.

02:30.692 --> 02:35.608
Three, two, one. Now!

02:36.865 --> 02:39.653
- Damn it! One more.
- Iris.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.405
Uh, Barry. Look, why don't we take five?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.278
No. Not until I get this. All right?
Come on.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.533
- Listen, Miyagi.
- What?

02:44.623 --> 02:46.660
I've been here all day
opening breaches, all right?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.707
So unless you wanna
rub your hands together

02:48.794 --> 02:50.001
and do some magic shoulder pop...

02:50.087 --> 02:52.579
- I'm not rubbing your shoulder.
- That's what I thought. I'm taking five.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.835
- Hey, come on.
- I'm taking five!

02:57.844 --> 02:59.961
I don't understand
why I can't get this.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.468
Well, probably because
you've been up all night.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.638
But that shouldn't matter.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.138
Look, Barry.
A breach closes in three picoseconds.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.595
DeVoe's could shut even faster.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.979
Look, I'm just saying that this
might not even be

03:11.066 --> 03:12.648
the best plan to catch him anyway.

03:12.734 --> 03:13.724
It's a plan, you know.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.855
It's the only one we have, right now.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.186
And what if he uses his force field
against you?

03:17.364 --> 03:18.480
You don't know how to get out of it yet.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.610
I don't know, Iris, but, I mean,
we need something.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.281
We have no leads
on the next three bus metas.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.203
No way to track DeVoe.
No way to stop him.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.871
I mean, he can't be this smart.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.168
I'm sorry, but, I mean,
we've been at this for months,

03:32.254 --> 03:33.586
and we have nothing.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.747
I mean, maybe that's the problem.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.043
You know,
sometimes you have to take a breather

03:40.137 --> 03:41.924
and let the answer come to you.
Do something else for a bit.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.254
Like what?

03:44.599 --> 03:48.058
Like date night, for starters?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.897
You know,
we haven't had any quality time,

03:53.984 --> 03:56.522
just you and me, since our honeymoon.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.193
Which was severely cut short.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.359
- I know we're the Flash, but...
- We're also Barry and Iris.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.369
No, you're right.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.785
All right. I'm gonna make
a reservation, tonight.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.413
Someplace very romantic.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.539
Mmm.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.666
Sounds perfect.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.916
How is it we live together,
work together,

04:21.011 --> 04:23.424
sleep in the same bed together,
but it still feels like

04:23.513 --> 04:26.005
we don't spend any real time
as husband and wife?

04:26.349 --> 04:30.093
<i>Allen. West-Allen.
Cortex, now!</i>

04:30.645 --> 04:32.682
I have no idea.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.645
Let's go.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.733
What is this?

04:45.827 --> 04:48.490
This is a signature field
mapping every time

04:48.580 --> 04:51.448
DeVoe's gone in and out of his lair
in a pocket dimension.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.533
- All of these?
- All of them.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.868
So, how did you do this?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.623
I didn't do it, actually. Ramon did.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.423
But all I did was just come up with
a really complex and eloquent algorithm

05:00.509 --> 05:01.545
to track the warping signatures...

05:01.635 --> 05:02.625
Don't do that, all right? Don't do that.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.176
Don't be modest, all right?
It's unbecoming.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.798
- You're unbecoming.
- You wish I was unbecoming.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.050
Do you know that these are DeVoe?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.472
These are DeVoe, all right?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.424
This is when Marlize
grabbed him from Izzy at Lawrence Hills.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.976
This is when he showed up
at Iron Heights Prison...

05:12.062 --> 05:13.269
This is DeVoe's house.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.891
And this is the alleyway
in the city center

05:14.981 --> 05:15.971
where he abducted you.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.275
- How long has this been going on?
- Wait for it.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.444
- The past three years.
- Three years?

05:21.530 --> 05:24.113
DeVoe orchestrated everything
to get the people he wanted on the bus.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.031
He's been planning this a long time.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.325
We've got a planner, just like Thawne.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.365
Just like Thawne.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.536
So, how do we use this?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.034
All we can do right now

05:33.124 --> 05:34.331
is just wait for the next marker
to appear.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.407
Try to get the jump on him.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.119
That, and keep an eye on Ralph,
using the old buddy system.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.374
Has anyone seen Ralph today?

05:39.464 --> 05:42.502
No, he's downstairs moving in.
He's very nervous.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.049
- I don't know why.
- I don't know why either.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.296
He's a superhero.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.174
People with powers
are ready for anything.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.505
God! Son of a breach!

05:48.598 --> 05:50.134
- Sorry.
- Jesse?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.807
Just came in through the breach room.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.135
Hey, Jesse. Welcome back.
What are you doing here?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.351
Wally's not here.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.989
Uh, you know an apology cube
usually works better

06:11.079 --> 06:12.866
when there's an actual apology on it?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.621
You get the sentiment.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.707
What's this?

06:17.794 --> 06:20.537
That is a mental activity dampener.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.250
It's for DA Cecile Horton.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.047
It keeps her from hearing
other people's thoughts.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.758
Kinda clunky.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.757
That's what she said.
Literally, that's what she said.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.554
The second version is more streamlined.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.303
- And what's all this?
- Those are thoughts.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.010
Musings how to stop DeVoe.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.721
Wow. He's really in your head, isn't he?

06:38.815 --> 06:42.149
Yeah. A lot of people are nowadays.
Thanks to you.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.060
Look, I thought you wanted me
to come here

06:44.154 --> 06:45.144
so we could talk about this.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.321
No, I want you to stop
bringing up your mother.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.320
I will, once you deal with her death.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.526
- I have.
- No, you haven't.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.986
Yes, I have. She died!

06:53.538 --> 06:55.154
Years ago, she died.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.455
There's nothing I could do to save her.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.873
End of story. Life goes on.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.075
Yeah, for everyone but you.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.246
Look, Dad, when Mom died,
you didn't talk about it.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.922
- There's nothing...
- Ever.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.544
And you've been upset
ever since.

07:06.635 --> 07:07.625
You've been miserable.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.381
You make everyone around you miserable.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.928
I mean, why do you think
I asked you to leave my team?

07:11.014 --> 07:12.004
Your team is a bunch of idiots.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.134
- Okay.
- No offense.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.590
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.095
I came here to stop DeVoe.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.802
No, you stayed because of DeVoe.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.057
A distinction without a difference.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.935
Dad, there's always going to be
some bad guy to stop,

07:22.025 --> 07:23.015
or algorithm to write,

07:23.109 --> 07:24.441
- Yeah.
- or problem to solve.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.768
Yeah. That's my point exactly.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.691
Look...

07:29.074 --> 07:33.284
I didn't want to talk about her death,
but I did.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.236
And it helped a lot.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.955
Trust me. You're never
going to be able to move on

07:38.041 --> 07:39.532
with your life
until you talk about this.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.745
Jesse! I can't! I...

07:51.262 --> 07:52.423
Look, Jesse.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.351
Your mother...

08:04.818 --> 08:06.150
You'll never understand.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.237
Yeah. I guess I won't.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.005
What?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.059
Get down!

09:07.547 --> 09:09.288
- You all right, Jonesy?
- I'll live.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.045
Here, put pressure on it.
Help's on the way.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.585
Who the hell are these guys?
They came out of nowhere.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.387
I don't know. But they want
whatever is in that container.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.090
Where is that?

09:20.185 --> 09:22.472
One of the hangars out at Wade airfield.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.552
My Dad said

09:23.646 --> 09:25.933
CCPD was escorting A.R.G.U.S. there
this morning for something.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.936
- He's there, Barry.
- Yeah. We gotta go.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.437
- We'll meet you there?
- Cool.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.517
I'll come, too.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.857
I could use the distraction.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.608
Come on, Flash.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.132
Guys, seven officers
and A.R.G.U.S. agents down.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.051
They just blew open
an A.R.G.U.S. transport container.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.379
West side of the hangar,
one armed assailant inside.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.463
<i>Got it.</i>

10:06.856 --> 10:07.846
Come on.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.107
It's ready.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.283
Stay down! Hands, head!

10:31.339 --> 10:33.456
Move, move!

10:42.016 --> 10:43.257
Just you and us now.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.723
Nice work, everyone.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.803
It's over.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.062
For all of Central City.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.776
No.

11:15.842 --> 11:16.832
Barry?

11:20.096 --> 11:21.086
We're too late.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.393
- That's a nuclear bomb.
- I know.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.065
And its core
has already gone critical.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.142
I know.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.602
The second we slow down, it's over.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.187
I know. That's not helping.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.199
Well, how long do you think we have?

11:43.870 --> 11:46.738
We just have to keep moving
until we figure out a way to stop it.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.831
Okay, we could run it to the Badlands.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.205
No. If we run that long,
it will speed up the reaction.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.082
We won't make it outside the city
before it explodes.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.708
But we can't run everyone
outside the city.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.879
I know.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.252
We're talking
hundreds of thousands of people.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.800
Even if there were
more than just the two of us,

11:59.886 --> 12:00.876
there's not enough time.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.175
Wait, that's it. Jay Garrick.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.473
- What about him?
- He might know what to do.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.016
Go to Earth-3, get him,

12:08.102 --> 12:09.434
bring him back here as fast as you can.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.510
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.751
I need you right now, man.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.671
Hey.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.716
Whoa. What is going on?

12:48.810 --> 12:50.551
You're moving with me at super-speed.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.353
What? Is this what it looks like
when you run?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.429
More or less.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.015
I have to say, it's a little uneventful.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.941
Hey. Come with me.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.449
I'm guessing
this is our Ark of the Covenant.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.071
Something like that, yeah.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.990
Whoa.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.160
Yeah, that will definitely
melt your face.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.293
That looks like

13:16.379 --> 13:19.338
an experimental fission engine,
deuterium isotopes.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.791
That would make this
an inertial confinement cage

13:21.884 --> 13:22.965
to stop the radiation.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.337
But with enough pressure,
the isotopes inside, they split,

13:26.431 --> 13:27.842
they produce heat, they produce light.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.016
Starts out blue, turns yellow,

13:31.102 --> 13:33.685
turns purple and then it's game over.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.307
Just please tell me
there's a way we can undo it.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.640
I think we are way past that point.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.226
- We have to do something.
- I...

13:41.529 --> 13:42.940
What if...
what if I breach it to a dead Earth?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.647
- Like I did with Fallout.
- Of course. Yeah.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.777
That's a great idea.

13:45.867 --> 13:46.857
All right. Do it.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.824
What's wrong?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.332
I think I might be all breached out.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.256
I don't know. I think I breached
one too many times today.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.086
No, that's not it. The breach is
a folding of space-time, right?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.340
So when we're moving this fast...

14:07.430 --> 14:10.138
When we're moving this fast,
when we're moving in Flashtime,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.718
then we don't have the time necessary
for a breach to form.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.928
- Exactly.
- Then that means I can't...

14:16.856 --> 14:19.269
That means I can't...

14:19.650 --> 14:22.734
Hey, hey. What's wrong?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.903
I don't know.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.940
You're not a speedster.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.071
Your body can't handle
moving this fast very long.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.244
I gotta let go, all right? Come here.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.659
All right.

14:34.749 --> 14:38.618
Wait. Ask Harry. He'll know.

14:39.504 --> 14:40.494
All right.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.372
I hope so.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.186
- Wells...
- How...

15:05.279 --> 15:07.771
- Allen. Why are you touching me? The...
- Hey.

15:07.865 --> 15:08.855
Listen.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.940
Am I in... Am I in...

15:10.034 --> 15:11.991
- Yes, you're in Flashtime. Yes.
- "Flashtime"?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.489
- What is Flashtime?
- Cisco just came up with it.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.787
Wait. You did this with Ramon
before you did this with me?

15:15.873 --> 15:17.205
- Hey, hey, we don't have time!
- Listen, the alarm...

15:17.291 --> 15:18.327
Yes, the alarm that we left for

15:18.418 --> 15:20.580
was an A.R.G.U.S. transport,
it had a fission engine in it.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.285
And it exploded?

15:22.380 --> 15:24.167
That's why I'm in this Flashtime...

15:24.257 --> 15:26.624
Wait. Jesse. Where is Jesse?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.299
No, she's fine. She left. She went to...

15:28.386 --> 15:29.422
Okay, Allen. That's great.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.174
Because if this city is gonna explode,
you need to send her

15:31.264 --> 15:32.550
as far away from here as possible.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.097
Listen. Listen. She went to Earth-3
to get Jay Garrick.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.469
- She's coming back?
- Yes. We need his help.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.394
- Allen, no, no, no. You cannot let her...
- Right now, I need your help, okay?

15:38.479 --> 15:41.142
- How do I stop the reaction?
- You can't stop it, this.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.222
What do you mean? Then what do I do?

15:42.316 --> 15:43.557
You have to send it away from here.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.641
- I can't. We tried.
- Cisco...

15:44.735 --> 15:46.897
- Open... open a...
- Cisco can't open a breach. He can't.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.104
- Because there's no time.
- Exactly.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.358
- But you can.
- What do you mean?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.439
- Allen, you can.
- No, I can't.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.608
- Listen to me. Allen, listen to me!
- What are you talking about?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.445
Space-time breaches
and the portal to the Speed Force

15:55.538 --> 15:56.619
operate under different physics.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.244
You open a portal to the Speed Force,

15:59.333 --> 16:00.869
you send it there.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.368
What will it do to the Speed Force?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.671
- What is... Why am I weak?
- Wells. I know. Wells...

16:05.756 --> 16:07.292
- It's the speed.
- Hey. Listen to me.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.794
- Will an explosion that... I know.
- The speed's affecting...

16:08.885 --> 16:10.672
Will an explosion that big
affect the Speed Force?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.253
I don't think so.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.009
What? What do you mean,
you don't think so?

16:15.099 --> 16:16.715
- Wells, hey...
- What the heck?

16:20.771 --> 16:23.479
Get her out of here. Allen. Allen...

16:23.983 --> 16:25.144
How'd you do that?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.224
Um, I'm not sure.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.686
I've been able to do it ever since
I came out of the Speed Force.

16:28.779 --> 16:29.895
That's a hell of a new trick.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.571
- Look, right now...
- I know.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.148
Jesse showed me the nuke.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.657
We're in trouble, kid.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.701
Well, I don't know. Wells has an idea
that he thinks might work.

16:36.787 --> 16:37.777
Yeah, what is it?

16:37.872 --> 16:39.659
We send the bomb into the Speed Force.

16:39.749 --> 16:40.990
Let it detonate in there.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.541
- Like hell, you will.
- What do you mean? Why not?

16:43.628 --> 16:45.870
Because, Flash, if you do that,

16:45.963 --> 16:47.829
we may lose the Speed Force forever.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.093
What do you mean,
we might lose the Speed Force?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.425
An explosion of that size
could destroy it completely.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.603
If that were to happen,
every speedster across space and time

17:02.688 --> 17:04.520
would lose access
to their speed instantly.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.598
Every speedster?

17:08.152 --> 17:10.940
Even if it got rid of Thawne
and every other evil speedster

17:11.030 --> 17:13.238
in the multi-verse, you cannot do this.

17:14.157 --> 17:15.147
I won't let you.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.193
Well, I'm sorry, Jay.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.280
If this is the only way to save
everyone in the city, I have to.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.884
Barry, listen to me.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.674
Harry didn't know anything
about the Speed Force, okay?

17:40.768 --> 17:44.136
None of us really do
and this isn't just about speed.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.971
You're talking about destroying
an essential element

17:46.065 --> 17:47.181
of the multi-verse.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.858
Nobody knows
what the consequences will be.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.936
You were trapped in there
longer than I was.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.270
If anyone can understand...

17:53.364 --> 17:55.071
Then what, Jay?
What's your idea?

18:01.455 --> 18:04.323
Okay, look. I mean,
did my dad have any other ideas?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.330
No, but we couldn't talk
for very long.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.626
Jay, I'm sorry. I just...

18:11.716 --> 18:13.457
No. That's all right, kid. I get it.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.093
All right. Back to basics.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.843
In nuclear fission,
enormous energy is created

18:20.933 --> 18:24.097
by a chain reaction of atoms
splitting and releasing neutrons.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.892
It's nearly impossible
to reverse this process.

18:27.982 --> 18:32.192
But theoretically,
you could restore stability.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.102
How?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.610
One way is to offset the loss
of mass by nuclear fusion.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.192
Great.
You have some sort of machine

18:40.286 --> 18:41.993
lying around here
that can generate that kind of energy?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.321
- No, we don't.
- But the other way,

18:44.415 --> 18:47.328
considering our predicament,
seems more promising.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.499
Which is what?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.703
Cooling it down.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.210
We need to hurry.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.509
Hey.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.851
I see all these frozen people
around me, Flash,

19:09.940 --> 19:11.522
and this time it's not my fault.

19:11.609 --> 19:12.816
We need your help.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.689
Three of you, now. What's going on?

19:14.779 --> 19:17.271
- The cargo in this container...
- It's a nuclear bomb.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.776
Yeah, and it went kaboom.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.865
- Dandy.
- Come here.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.945
It's toasty in here.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.450
We need you to cool it down.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.203
You want me to cool down
a nuclear reaction

19:29.293 --> 19:32.001
that's already gone critical?

19:34.423 --> 19:37.382
- You're serious?
- Quickly, please, Miss Frost.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.759
All right. Let's give it a whirl.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.180
Didn't go quite how I expected.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.686
Try... try again.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.194
No, no.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.072
So that's what heat feels like.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.123
You're burning up. Come on.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.373
All right. It's okay. All right.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.089
I have to let you go. All right?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.042
Barry...

20:21.887 --> 20:23.378
Don't let Caity die.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.090
Okay.

20:29.812 --> 20:30.802
Now what?

20:30.896 --> 20:33.479
Guess we have to find
that fusion machine after all.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.856
- Wait a second.
- What?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.355
What if we're the machine?

20:41.532 --> 20:42.522
How so?

20:44.118 --> 20:46.906
Well, you said that we could
offset the energy of the bomb

20:46.996 --> 20:48.282
with the energy from nuclear fusion.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.408
Theoretically.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.956
Right, and the reaction
that container is giving off,

20:52.042 --> 20:54.079
I don't know,
three million tons of energy?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.331
Give or take.

20:55.421 --> 20:59.415
So, three megatons of energy,
that's three billion joules.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.000
Each lightning bolt gives off
roughly one billion joules, so...

21:02.094 --> 21:03.960
So if we all throw a lightning bolt
at the same time...

21:04.054 --> 21:05.135
It could be enough.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.931
That's enough.
That will work. Let's do it.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.817
Jay! Hey.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.861
Hey.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.233
I'm not used to going this long.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.650
- Hey, hey. It's okay. It's all right.
- Damn legs.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.201
Don't work like they once did.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.277
It's okay.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.862
I'm not gonna be able
to finish this one, Flash.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.572
- I'm sorry.
- Just rest.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.959
I'm so sorry.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.726
Barry, the two of us can't produce
enough lightning power

21:53.813 --> 21:55.600
to offset the energy from that bomb.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.729
I mean, even if we had full speed,
which we don't... At least, I don't.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.895
We have to send it into the Speed Force.

22:04.782 --> 22:05.943
You heard what Jay said.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.319
And Harry said it would be fine.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.492
No, he said he thinks it would be fine.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.036
Barry, my dad never thinks anything,
he knows.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.747
Jay was right. We can't do it.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.285
Damn it!

22:23.008 --> 22:24.920
Okay, what if... I don't know,

22:25.010 --> 22:26.376
what if we run back in time

22:26.470 --> 22:28.302
and stop this bomb from ever going off?

22:28.389 --> 22:29.880
No, Jesse. We can't do that.

22:29.974 --> 22:30.964
Yeah, well,
it's kind of our only option.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.048
It's not an option.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.724
Even if it saves the city
and everyone in it?

22:33.811 --> 22:35.097
It's not saving them, okay?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.473
The second you alter the timeline,

22:36.564 --> 22:39.272
everything changes,
especially the people you love.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.441
Trust me. I learned that the hard way.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.019
Well, maybe a new version of my dad
isn't the worst thing in the world.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.656
Look, Jesse,
whatever problems you two have,

22:47.741 --> 22:48.982
they're not gonna get solved
by forcing him

22:49.076 --> 22:51.068
to do something he doesn't want to.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.572
He has to make that decision.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.493
Oh, God.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.541
The reaction's combustion's
reached its final phase.

23:06.427 --> 23:07.713
I think we're slowing down.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.920
So everything else is speeding up.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.214
Barry, I don't have any more ideas.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.298
Me either.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.846
I don't know how much longer I can run.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.352
You have to get out of here.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.642
Use the speed you have left
to get back to Earth-2.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.895
- Your dad wanted you to leave.
- Yeah, I heard.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.018
So you'd be safe, Jesse.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.021
He loves you, all right?
More than anything.

23:28.699 --> 23:29.689
Go.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.615
- No, I can't just...
- Go.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.958
I'm sorry.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.894
I wish I could tell you this
while you could still hear me.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.151
I know how happy Mom made you,

24:52.616 --> 24:54.653
and how sad you are now that she's gone.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.703
But I just... I don't know why
you won't talk about it.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.035
I don't know, maybe you don't need to.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.035
I just want you to be happy again.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.789
That's all I've ever wanted.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.203
<i>And I don't know
the PSI...</i>

25:41.206 --> 25:42.287
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

25:42.708 --> 25:44.665
<i>No, this won't work. Damn!</i>

25:57.139 --> 25:59.347
<i>Oh, God,
I think it's happening.</i>

26:38.097 --> 26:40.214
- Oh, Barry. What...
- Iris.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.299
- I'm...
- You're moving as fast as I am,

26:42.392 --> 26:43.633
like in the courtroom.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.968
What? Why, didn't you...

26:45.062 --> 26:46.644
- I can't.
- Oh, my God. What?

26:46.730 --> 26:47.720
I can't.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.396
I can't save us this time.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.449
What do you mean you can't save us?

27:07.543 --> 27:08.875
- There's a bomb.
- What?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.044
A nuke. It's already gone off.
I can't stop it.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.962
Wait... but... there's got to be
something that you can do...

27:13.048 --> 27:14.414
No, I tried. We tried everything.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.091
We tried lightning,
we tried cooling it down,

27:17.177 --> 27:20.090
breaching it to a dead Earth.
There's nothing that would work.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.181
- I don't know what to do.
- Okay.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.384
- As soon as I stop, it's gonna...
- I know. I know.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.310
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.480
I don't know how much longer
I can hold out.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.063
- I'm so tired.
- Okay. It's okay, Barry.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.644
Oh, my God, you're burning up.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.774
- I've been at this for a while. For me.
- Okay.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.737
- Hey. Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm sorry.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.614
No, don't be sorry.
Look at me, be here with me.

27:43.704 --> 27:47.038
- I'm...
- I love you. Okay?

27:49.835 --> 27:53.419
This isn't exactly the quality time
I was imagining,

27:56.008 --> 27:57.465
but it's still nice.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.924
Every moment with you, Barry,
has always been nice.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.175
Every moment.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.058
You're my lightning rod, Iris.

28:11.273 --> 28:12.263
What?

28:13.400 --> 28:14.390
What?

28:15.027 --> 28:17.189
You said
you tried to use lightning. How?

28:17.279 --> 28:18.611
We tried. It didn't work.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.315
If it was powerful enough,
it could've fused the split atoms,

28:22.409 --> 28:23.945
it could've negated the effects
of the bomb.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.238
But I can't do it alone.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.695
I can't generate that kind of energy.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.622
No, you can't, but the Speed Force can.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.745
What?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.703
When you went into the Speed Force,
the lightning from the storm...

28:35.672 --> 28:37.664
One of those bolts would be
more than enough,

28:38.592 --> 28:40.379
but I can't...
How could I draw that out?

28:40.469 --> 28:42.301
No, listen. When we freed you,

28:42.387 --> 28:44.549
Cisco and Caitlin,
they used a Quark Sphere

28:44.640 --> 28:45.630
programmed with your genetic marker

28:45.724 --> 28:48.137
to trick the Speed Force into thinking
that you were still in there.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.468
- I just need to get that sphere.
- Yeah.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.394
The storm will chase me.

28:52.940 --> 28:53.930
It's like you said.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.273
A lightning rod
to bring out the lightning.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.614
- Come back to me.
- As fast as I can.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.133
Here we go.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.299
Jesse.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.010
You're here.

31:38.897 --> 31:39.887
I'm here.

31:50.659 --> 31:55.779
Barry? Barry! Barry!

32:02.170 --> 32:05.163
Flash! Flash!

32:09.261 --> 32:10.377
Flash.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.048
Are we dead?

32:18.145 --> 32:21.058
- No.
- That's good.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.278
<i>Today, I showed you
how easy a city can fall.</i>

32:34.077 --> 32:35.238
<i>Mark my words.</i>

32:35.871 --> 32:38.579
<i>Nuclear power will bring
only destruction to the world.</i>

32:39.374 --> 32:40.910
<i>You'll see it again.</i>

32:41.001 --> 32:42.333
<i>And when you do,</i>

32:42.419 --> 32:45.002
<i>you'll all remember
the name Veronica Dale,</i>

32:45.088 --> 32:47.421
<i>and fully understand my actions.</i>

32:48.175 --> 32:51.134
<i>Eden Corps. Eden Corps!</i>

32:51.261 --> 32:52.843
<i>Eden Corps!</i>

32:53.972 --> 32:55.884
I feel like she's saying, "Eden Corps."

32:56.933 --> 33:00.017
As in blasting everybody back
to the days of the Garden of Eden.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.311
This was to air after the city fell.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.184
Found her manifesto at her apartment.

33:04.274 --> 33:06.516
Environmental activist
turned animal-liberator,

33:06.610 --> 33:07.771
turned domestic terrorist.

33:07.861 --> 33:08.851
Turned cray-cray.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.441
How did she find out about
the A.R.G.U.S. drop, anyway?

33:11.531 --> 33:12.897
Somebody must have tipped her off.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.148
DeVoe.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.858
But why would he, or she, whoever...

33:15.952 --> 33:17.568
Why blow up the whole city?

33:17.662 --> 33:18.698
Why kill nearly everyone here?

33:18.788 --> 33:20.404
Maybe there is no method to the madness.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.742
Well, this was fun, as usual.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.669
But it's time for the old crimson comet
to head back home.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.087
Thanks for your help, Jay.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.415
Yeah. If it wasn't
for you two and Jesse,

33:30.884 --> 33:33.126
it'd be a completely different story
in the news right now.

33:33.220 --> 33:36.008
You were a big part of that, Iris.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.508
Credit where credit's due.

33:37.599 --> 33:38.931
My sentiments exactly.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.554
So when you get home, you need to rest.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.136
Your glucose levels are pretty low.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.766
Thanks. When I get back,

33:44.856 --> 33:46.848
I think I'll be doing nothing
but getting rest.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.182
Meaning?

33:49.402 --> 33:51.485
I've been at this hero game a long time.

33:52.739 --> 33:56.653
A long, long time, and after today,

33:57.661 --> 33:59.402
I'm thinking about trying my hand
at something new.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.612
Like what?

34:00.705 --> 34:03.368
For starters,
training someone to take over.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.325
There's another Flash on your Earth?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.870
There will be,
as soon as I'm done training her.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.496
Her?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.668
What, do you think we're good
with the Speed Force?

34:15.762 --> 34:18.049
Well, if not,
we'll find out soon enough.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.058
- Always a pleasure, Flash.
- Always.

34:25.938 --> 34:29.603
So, you need to rest as well, mister.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.567
No running, no Flash.
Your system's taxed.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.192
- I'm good.
- You will be, but you're not yet.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.899
That's right.
Anything comes up, we got it.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.243
Iris, make sure this man rests.

34:42.539 --> 34:43.655
I'm on it.

34:49.879 --> 34:51.996
- Long time.
- Yes, it was.

34:52.882 --> 34:53.871
You know,

34:53.967 --> 34:55.299
I realized a couple of things
when I was in Flashtime.

34:55.385 --> 34:56.920
Yeah, what's that?

34:57.470 --> 35:00.929
Well, I'm more than fast enough
to catch DeVoe.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.097
We just need to know

35:02.183 --> 35:03.719
when he's coming out
of the pocket dimension sooner.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.262
Yeah. We'll figure that out.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.356
What's the other thing?

35:13.528 --> 35:15.770
You were right about taking a breather.

35:17.824 --> 35:22.944
Just a moment with you,
being grounded again.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.696
Everything becomes more clear.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.124
Scooch over.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.708
Sorry about date night.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.838
Don't be.

35:38.928 --> 35:43.343
Power bars and sweatpants.
It's all I really need.

35:58.448 --> 36:01.111
Uh, this is my exit.

36:01.951 --> 36:02.941
You... oh.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.409
- Right.
- Yeah.

36:10.627 --> 36:14.541
Jesse, the reason
that I can't talk about...

36:14.631 --> 36:18.170
You know what? It's okay.
You don't have to explain.

36:18.718 --> 36:21.335
I don't... I don't?
I thought that's what you wanted.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.846
Yeah, um...

36:25.350 --> 36:27.057
I don't know, I thought making you

36:27.143 --> 36:30.682
confront all the emotions
that you have with losing Mom

36:30.772 --> 36:34.812
would help you move on
and be happy again.

36:36.027 --> 36:39.441
But I can't decide when you're
ready to do that. Only you can.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.615
- So, I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry. It's okay.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.030
I do want you to know though,

36:46.121 --> 36:50.286
if the time comes
and you want to talk about it,

36:50.375 --> 36:51.456
I'm here.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.838
Actually, if that's the case,

37:00.927 --> 37:02.668
why don't you stick around
for a little bit longer?

37:03.680 --> 37:07.469
- What, you wanna talk now?
- No. I'd like you to listen.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.099
Have a seat.

37:09.811 --> 37:10.927
I'm gonna fix this to your forehead.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.052
What is that?

37:12.147 --> 37:13.308
It's the streamlined version

37:13.398 --> 37:15.640
of DA Cecile Horton's
mental activity dampener.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.606
- Nice upgrade.
- Thank you.

37:19.696 --> 37:23.235
But I thought this was supposed
to block out people's thoughts?

37:23.324 --> 37:24.314
Not anymore.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.198
Now, it allows you to hear them.

37:37.797 --> 37:38.787
Your mother.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.004
I don't know how... I don't...

37:47.640 --> 37:50.724
You see, when you have a love,
had a love,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.562
like your mother and I had,
and you lose that love...

38:05.533 --> 38:07.115
Anyway, um,

38:08.369 --> 38:11.362
maybe this will help you understand
why it's been so hard for me.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.590
<i>Because, in the vast night sky,</i>

38:24.219 --> 38:27.007
<i>you are the only star I see.</i>

38:27.847 --> 38:28.837
Mom.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.650
<i>She's a miracle.</i>

38:46.366 --> 38:47.356
<i>Jesse.</i>

38:49.577 --> 38:50.909
<i>She's just like me.</i>

38:52.831 --> 38:55.790
<i>Sweetie, come here.</i>

39:00.088 --> 39:01.374
<i>Be with me.</i>

39:09.722 --> 39:11.213
Thank you, Allie.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.299
- So...
- So.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.551
Jesse seemed better when she left.

39:15.645 --> 39:16.635
So do you.

39:18.439 --> 39:19.429
Did you guys have a nice talk?

39:19.524 --> 39:22.483
Well, it was actually more of
a listening session than a talk,

39:22.569 --> 39:24.105
but we're good. Yeah. Both of us.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.236
That's good, Harry.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.735
- Yeah. And what about you?
- What?

39:29.826 --> 39:30.862
Come on. I know you well enough to know

39:30.952 --> 39:32.944
that something's on your mind.
What is it?

39:33.872 --> 39:36.285
It's Killer Frost.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.365
What about Killer Frost?

39:39.210 --> 39:42.453
I don't know anything
that she says or does.

39:42.547 --> 39:46.291
It's scary and alarming
to have this person

39:46.384 --> 39:48.421
that you know nothing about
living inside of you.

39:48.928 --> 39:49.964
But for the first time,

39:51.681 --> 39:52.922
I remember what she did.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.220
What do you remember?

39:56.853 --> 39:59.391
Barry taking her into Flashtime,
trying to freeze the bomb...

39:59.480 --> 40:00.470
Mmm-hmm.

40:00.607 --> 40:04.647
And Killer Frost being worried.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.445
Worried about what, about dying?

40:09.365 --> 40:10.355
About me.

40:11.701 --> 40:12.691
Interesting.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.946
Oh, my gosh.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.903
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to drop that.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.239
- It just slipped out of my hands.
- It's okay.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.950
My first Killer Frost

40:21.044 --> 40:22.285
and I go and ruin it.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.835
- That's...
- Typical... typical me.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.083
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.789
I just get so clumsy when I'm nervous.

40:26.883 --> 40:27.873
What are you nervous about?

40:28.384 --> 40:31.218
I'm supposed to be meeting
some people here for the first time

40:31.304 --> 40:32.340
and I've got the jitters.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.387
Which
is what this place is called.

40:34.474 --> 40:35.590
Hey, it is.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.675
- Apt name, don't you think?
- I do.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.936
It's funny. You know, you get nervous,
you get the jitters, you go for coffee

40:41.022 --> 40:42.058
and the caffeine acts as a stimulant,

40:42.148 --> 40:43.980
which makes you shaky,
which could also be known as...

40:44.067 --> 40:45.308
- The jitters.
- Exactly.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.942
Okay, right. I get it.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.988
Okay. We're gonna go.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.190
- Okay.
- Yeah.

40:53.910 --> 40:56.527
- I'm really very, very sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

40:56.621 --> 40:57.782
Good luck with your meeting.
I hope it goes well.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.237
Thanks.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.702
It did.
