WEBVTT

00:01.915 --> 00:03.644
- Come on, Jack.
- Still no, Daniel.

00:03.717 --> 00:06.550
- It isn't on a permanent basis.
- I didn't let you go in the first place.

00:06.620 --> 00:08.554
What makes you think
I'm gonna change my mind?

00:08.622 --> 00:10.419
Because-

00:10.490 --> 00:12.424
Can you try to do
better than that?

00:12.492 --> 00:14.426
Because they're gonna need somebody
who can translate Ancient.

00:14.494 --> 00:16.428
I'm the most qualified person
left on the planet for the mission.

00:16.496 --> 00:19.624
Which is exactly why
you're gonna stay right here.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.691
Because I'll quit.

00:22.369 --> 00:25.361
Why don't you just hold your breath?
You haven't done that in a while.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.507
General.

00:32.312 --> 00:34.246
I let myself in.
I hope you don't mind.

00:34.314 --> 00:37.875
- Absolutely not. Welcome.
- Thank you.

00:39.853 --> 00:42.185
- Miss the chair?
- Actually, I do.

00:42.255 --> 00:44.815
- Want it back?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

00:44.891 --> 00:46.722
My new one just isn't the same.

00:48.462 --> 00:51.192
That's not exactly what I meant.

00:51.264 --> 00:54.233
Dr. Jackson, nice to see you again.

00:54.301 --> 00:56.769
Likewise.
We miss you around here, sir.

00:58.805 --> 01:01.103
To what do we owe this pleasure?

01:01.174 --> 01:04.837
I came to ask if you'd be interested
in joining the mission to Atlantis.

01:04.911 --> 01:06.242
You did?

01:06.313 --> 01:08.747
He's the most qualified person
on this planet.

01:08.815 --> 01:11.943
And the mission commander needs
someone who can translate Ancient.

01:13.253 --> 01:15.278
- Really?
- With all due respect, sir...

01:15.355 --> 01:19.553
I think you should tell the mission
commander that I need Daniel right here.

01:19.626 --> 01:22.618
- You just did.
- I did. I did?

01:25.165 --> 01:28.965
- You, sir?
- Yes. Request denied.

01:29.936 --> 01:32.131
Dr. Jackson, you're with me.

01:32.205 --> 01:34.935
I'll have the chair
shipped to Washington.

01:35.008 --> 01:36.999
You can requisition a new one.

01:37.077 --> 01:39.011
I'll do that, sir.

01:39.079 --> 01:43.413
We leave tomorrow.
And I'll be taking Walter too.

03:10.303 --> 03:11.964
General.

03:12.038 --> 03:13.528
Welcome aboard.

03:14.207 --> 03:16.334
Thank you, sir, again.

03:16.409 --> 03:18.809
My motives were purely selfish,
Dr. Jackson.

03:18.879 --> 03:22.474
We haven't heard a word from the Atlantis
expedition team since they first left.

03:22.549 --> 03:25.040
We have no idea
what we're going to find in Pegasus.

03:25.118 --> 03:28.554
Your knowledge and expertise
will no doubt prove invaluable.

03:28.622 --> 03:31.750
- General, if you don't mind my asking-
- Why am I going?

03:31.825 --> 03:34.293
You could've chosen anyone
to command this mission.

03:34.361 --> 03:38.559
I sat back and watched you people go
on to a lot of adventures over the years.

03:38.632 --> 03:40.896
I thought, when you were
replaced at the SGC...

03:40.967 --> 03:43.060
you were buckin' for retirement.

03:43.136 --> 03:45.900
And then I led <i>Prometheus</i>
against Anubis's fleet.

03:45.972 --> 03:47.906
Got your dander up.

03:47.974 --> 03:50.704
That's why I took the job
as head of home world security.

03:50.777 --> 03:54.144
Then this opportunity came along.
The president put me in charge.

03:54.214 --> 03:56.478
I could choose anyone I wanted
to lead the mission.

03:56.550 --> 03:59.348
- So why not choose yourself?
- Like I said...

03:59.419 --> 04:01.683
I've sent a lot of people
into action over the years...

04:01.755 --> 04:04.519
and more than a few didn't come back.

04:04.591 --> 04:06.684
I'd like to see this one
through personally.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.127
- We've never left anyone behind, sir.
- And we're not going to this time.

04:17.938 --> 04:19.872
<i>Last reported MALPtelemetry</i>
<i>from Atlantis...</i>

04:19.940 --> 04:22.738
indicated an enclosed space
with viable life support.

04:22.809 --> 04:24.538
Stop it. You're pathetic.

04:24.611 --> 04:26.704
We're going on the assumption that
the expedition team found the Lost City...

04:26.780 --> 04:28.975
and was able to set up
a base of operations there.

04:29.716 --> 04:31.741
- Sorry.
- Dr. Novak.

04:32.519 --> 04:35.317
The Asgard hyperdrive
is functioning at 100%, sir.

04:35.388 --> 04:37.754
Thank you. Dr. Jackson.

04:38.825 --> 04:40.554
I'm sorry. What was I saying?

04:40.627 --> 04:43.528
You were assuming the Lost City
is at the other end of this field trip.

04:44.764 --> 04:47.130
- Please ignore me.
- It's hard to.

04:47.901 --> 04:50.301
- You disagree, Doctor?
- Well, as far as we know...

04:50.370 --> 04:53.237
the Atlantis team found another outpost
like the one on Antarctica.

04:53.306 --> 04:56.298
Could be on a moon or at the bottom
of some deep, dark ocean.

04:56.376 --> 04:58.901
Which is why we're going.
If they're trapped and need help-

04:58.979 --> 05:01.106
If they're even alive at all.

05:01.181 --> 05:03.672
As for why they've been unable
to make contact with Earth...

05:03.750 --> 05:07.117
hopefully it's just a matter of being
unable to locate a viable power source.

05:07.187 --> 05:10.486
Using information collected
from the Ancient outpost on Earth...

05:10.557 --> 05:14.653
Dr. Jackson and his team have pinpointed
our destination in the Pegasus galaxy.

05:14.728 --> 05:16.662
Which is here.

05:18.598 --> 05:20.532
Damn it to hell.

05:41.655 --> 05:43.987
- Dr. Novak.
- Dr. Jackson.

05:44.057 --> 05:46.617
- Daniel.
- You can call me Lindsey.

05:46.693 --> 05:48.854
Sorry for contradicting
you in the briefing.

05:48.928 --> 05:50.919
Don't be. I mean, you were right.

05:50.997 --> 05:54.489
The fact that we haven't heard from
the Atlantis expedition since they left...

05:54.567 --> 05:56.933
is a... bad sign.

06:01.841 --> 06:05.004
- Have you tried holding your breath?
- Oh, God. I've tried everything.

06:05.078 --> 06:08.479
- It doesn't work for me either.
- It's been like this since I was a kid.

06:11.051 --> 06:12.985
It comes out when I get scared...

06:13.053 --> 06:16.318
but this is the worst it's been
since my PhD presentation.

06:16.389 --> 06:19.381
I mean, I don't really do well
in stressful situations.

06:19.459 --> 06:22.223
I guess that's why I turned down
going to Atlantis the first time.

06:22.295 --> 06:24.024
I'm sure you're going to be fine.

06:24.097 --> 06:26.565
General Hammond says
you're very good at what you do.

06:26.633 --> 06:28.123
Thank you.

06:28.968 --> 06:31.266
- What's that? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

06:35.542 --> 06:36.702
Okay.

06:44.984 --> 06:47.851
We're pickin' up
what sounds like a distress call.

06:47.921 --> 06:50.947
- Where are we?
- We're still well inside the Milky Way.

06:51.024 --> 06:52.958
- Play it back.
- Yes, sir.

06:53.026 --> 06:55.187
<i>Help. Plea-</i>

06:55.261 --> 06:57.627
<i>Require assistance. Have failed-</i>

06:58.698 --> 07:01.963
Lost power to-
Repeat. Stranded and-

07:02.702 --> 07:05.296
- She sounds human.
- What do you think?

07:06.039 --> 07:08.735
As much as I hate to delay this trip,
I think we have to check it out.

07:08.808 --> 07:11.106
- How far away is it?
- The message is originating...

07:11.177 --> 07:13.338
just over 50 light-years
off our designated route.

07:13.413 --> 07:16.610
We could be there in... <i>20</i> minutes.

07:16.683 --> 07:18.617
- Set a course.
- Yes, sir.

07:30.997 --> 07:33.465
Set shields at maximum.
Arm weapons.

07:34.167 --> 07:36.032
Looks like an Al'kesh
and a cargo ship.

07:36.102 --> 07:38.536
Scans indicate
they've suffered significant damage.

07:38.605 --> 07:41.005
The distress signal is originating
from within the Al'kesh.

07:41.074 --> 07:44.066
I don't understand.
A human distress call from a Goa'uld ship.

07:44.144 --> 07:46.510
- That makes no sense.
- I agree, sir.

07:46.579 --> 07:48.911
- It could be a trap.
- I know this looks suspicious...

07:48.982 --> 07:51.746
but what if there was an uprising
on board one of those ships?

07:52.819 --> 07:54.810
There could be human prisoners
in need of our help.

07:56.623 --> 07:58.557
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

07:59.559 --> 08:02.722
This is General George Hammond
of the Earth vessel <i>Prometheus.</i>

08:02.796 --> 08:06.323
We're answering your distress call
and standing ready to assist you.

08:08.001 --> 08:11.493
We can transport a portable sensor unit on
board to determine life-support viability.

08:12.772 --> 08:16.003
General, an Al'kesh
is a potentially valuable ship.

08:16.075 --> 08:19.374
Even if there are no survivors, we need
to determine if it's space worthy.

08:19.445 --> 08:21.606
If it is, we should salvage her.

08:22.515 --> 08:24.449
- Take a team.
- Yes, sir.

08:51.578 --> 08:55.139
<i>Prometheus,</i> this is SG-3.
We are on board.

09:03.890 --> 09:06.256
General, we're seeing
some energy-weapon damage.

09:25.144 --> 09:28.705
We have oneJaffa. KIA.

09:29.382 --> 09:31.782
Sir, over here.

09:39.859 --> 09:41.793
Make that fourJaffa.

09:43.096 --> 09:45.428
Looks like these folks had
a little onboard firefight.

09:46.165 --> 09:49.760
Still no sign of life.
We're headin' to the bridge.

09:56.876 --> 09:58.810
Prometheus,
<i>someonejust activated the-</i>

09:59.646 --> 10:01.580
Colonel Reynolds, say again.

10:01.648 --> 10:03.775
Sir, our rings just activated.

10:12.659 --> 10:16.595
Security team to Level 4 ring room.
Visuals on screen.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.425
- Seal it off.
- Controls are not responding, sir.

10:23.503 --> 10:24.993
Airman?

10:25.071 --> 10:27.665
It's no good, sir.
The rings will not activate.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.675
Security team, report.

10:32.745 --> 10:34.679
All shipboard communications are down.

10:34.747 --> 10:36.840
- Initiate emergency lockdown.
- I can't, sir.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.783
- It may be possible from the engine room.
- Go.

11:07.780 --> 11:09.771
That wasn't me, sir.

11:11.484 --> 11:13.475
Let's get 'em outta there.

12:21.754 --> 12:23.688
Can we pursue?

12:27.593 --> 12:30.687
Engines are off-line.
Controls are unresponsive.

12:31.998 --> 12:35.126
The weapons are off-line too, sir.
It looks like we're dead in the water.

12:35.201 --> 12:37.863
General, I just did a head count.

12:37.937 --> 12:40.337
DanielJackson
is still aboard <i>Prometheus.</i>

13:06.165 --> 13:07.655
Crap.

13:16.442 --> 13:19.468
- Are you okay?
- I feel like my head's going to explode.

13:20.446 --> 13:23.438
But, on the bright side,
I think my hiccups are gone.

13:26.052 --> 13:29.021
- What do you need, sir?
- I need this ship operational now.

13:29.088 --> 13:31.386
Yes, sir. Thank you.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.831
Near as I can tell, we're lucky that
life-support systems are still working.

13:43.903 --> 13:46.599
- How much time do you figure we have?
- That's hard to say.

13:46.672 --> 13:50.472
I've got some secondary systems on-line,
including some short-range sensors, sir.

13:50.543 --> 13:54.206
Scans of the cargo ship indicate that
it's in worse shape than this Al'kesh.

13:55.615 --> 13:57.105
Strange, isn't it, sir?

13:57.183 --> 14:00.414
That a Goa'uld Super Soldier would go
to all this trouble to keep us alive?

14:33.686 --> 14:35.677
Hey, how's it goin'?

14:44.997 --> 14:46.931
Guess it's just you and me, huh?

14:51.470 --> 14:53.461
It's a little strange, isn't it?

14:55.208 --> 14:58.234
You see, that weapon I shot you with
should've killed you.

14:58.311 --> 15:01.303
What's even stranger is you guys
usually don't take prisoners either.

15:01.380 --> 15:03.507
I mean, it's kinda kill first and-

15:06.285 --> 15:09.277
That's generally just about it.
Just the killing.

15:11.190 --> 15:14.648
I'm just gonna talk to myself for a while,
'cause you're not gonna talk to me.

15:14.727 --> 15:16.786
Not that you guys
are very talkative, but-

15:18.164 --> 15:20.155
You may prove useful.

15:21.434 --> 15:23.902
Okay. Now we're gettin' somewhere.

15:25.438 --> 15:27.372
Where's everybody else?

15:27.440 --> 15:29.806
I transported them onto the Al'kesh.

15:31.244 --> 15:35.476
Well, you kept the wrong guy, 'cause
I don't know anything about the ship.

15:38.484 --> 15:41.044
But you are very attractive.

15:45.124 --> 15:46.614
What?

15:48.794 --> 15:50.989
Hey, you know, big guy-

15:51.063 --> 15:52.997
I'm flattered. Really, I am.

15:53.065 --> 15:55.761
It's just that... you're not my type.

15:55.835 --> 15:59.965
And I'm more than a little disturbed
that I might be yours.

16:02.308 --> 16:04.071
Whoa! You don't have to do that!
Don't. Don't!

16:11.050 --> 16:13.951
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you-

16:15.054 --> 16:18.751
- Thank God.
- Much, I hope.

16:28.234 --> 16:32.466
I wish to send a long-range transmission
using the communications systems.

16:33.539 --> 16:36.167
- Sorry. Don't have a clue.
- You're lying.

16:36.242 --> 16:39.678
In general? No. Yes.
Well, I try to be honest, but...

16:39.745 --> 16:42.305
you know, occasionally a little white one
slips out every now and again.

16:48.154 --> 16:50.145
Shall I kiss it better?

16:57.129 --> 16:59.097
Just don't do it again.

17:00.499 --> 17:04.026
Hey, look, even if I knew
what it is you wanted me to do...

17:04.103 --> 17:06.037
what makes you think I'd tell you?

17:06.872 --> 17:09.534
How the hell do you think you can steal
a ship when you don't know how it works?

17:09.608 --> 17:11.701
I got the sub-light engines going.

17:13.212 --> 17:15.146
Yeah, so you did.

17:15.214 --> 17:18.081
You really expect me to believe
you don't know how your own ship works?

17:18.150 --> 17:19.640
Okay.

17:20.519 --> 17:23.818
Look, my name is DanielJackson.
I'm an archaeologist.

17:23.889 --> 17:25.789
A historian.

17:25.858 --> 17:27.792
I study ancient cultures...

17:27.860 --> 17:29.851
histories of the past,
ancient civilizations.

17:29.929 --> 17:32.830
- Have you heard of Earth? Tauri?
- No.

17:32.898 --> 17:35.025
We were on our way to rescue
a few friends who are trapped-

17:35.101 --> 17:37.035
I really don't care.

17:39.672 --> 17:41.606
Look, this really isn't necessary.

17:41.674 --> 17:44.939
Can I have the ship? No.
Okay. Discussion over.

17:53.352 --> 17:55.081
Here we go.

17:58.424 --> 18:00.358
Tenat of Oran.

18:01.527 --> 18:04.155
Tenat, this is Vala.
If you can hear me, please respond.

18:06.365 --> 18:09.232
I've managed to procure a vessel bigger
and better than what I'd hoped for.

18:09.301 --> 18:12.600
Tenat, if you get this message,
I apologize for the delay...

18:12.671 --> 18:15.401
and we'll meet at the designated
coordinates in one day.

18:16.509 --> 18:18.204
Vala out.

18:18.978 --> 18:21.242
Now, about the hyperdrive.

18:33.259 --> 18:34.749
Colonel. Doctor.

18:34.827 --> 18:37.728
I've rerouted remaining power to shields
and life support for the time being.

18:37.797 --> 18:39.662
But as far as the engines go-

18:39.732 --> 18:42.667
The control crystals for both sub-light
and hyperdrive engines are totally fried.

18:42.735 --> 18:44.669
It looks like they were
deliberately sabotaged.

18:44.737 --> 18:46.728
Can they be repaired?

18:46.806 --> 18:49.070
In a word- no.
We need new ones.

18:49.809 --> 18:51.606
I was thinking about that cargo ship, sir.

18:51.677 --> 18:54.145
Sergeant Harriman says
life support over there is minimal...

18:54.213 --> 18:57.011
barely enough to sustain
one person for a few moments.

18:57.082 --> 19:00.449
If we don't get new crystals-
Sorry. Kill me now.

19:01.687 --> 19:03.848
- I'll go, sir.
- I'll go.

19:03.923 --> 19:08.019
- With all due respect-
- Someone took my ship. I want it back.

19:21.841 --> 19:23.832
Access is restricted by code.

19:23.909 --> 19:25.900
Yeah? Too bad.

19:28.848 --> 19:30.338
God!

19:33.619 --> 19:35.109
That hurt?

19:35.788 --> 19:37.278
Yeah!

19:38.858 --> 19:40.985
I can fix it.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.994
I don't know the code!

19:59.478 --> 20:02.709
There. Feel better?

20:09.788 --> 20:13.121
- You're a Goa'uld.
- No.

20:13.192 --> 20:15.353
But I was once a host to one.

20:15.427 --> 20:19.022
Which explains the naquadah in your blood
that lets you use Goa'uld technology.

20:19.098 --> 20:22.067
And how I can quickly learn
to fly this rather primitive ship.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.864
So primitive one would wonder
if it was worth the bother.

20:24.937 --> 20:26.928
In this case,
it's the size that matters.

20:29.275 --> 20:31.743
Actually, pretty much in every case.

20:36.782 --> 20:38.716
Tell me the code.

20:42.454 --> 20:43.944
Please.

20:46.592 --> 20:48.526
I don't know it.

20:50.362 --> 20:51.852
Fine.

21:10.816 --> 21:14.081
- How much time will he have?
- I'm guessing a few minutes.

21:16.221 --> 21:17.552
Maybe less.

21:17.623 --> 21:19.887
- Sir.
- Not another word, Colonel.

21:24.196 --> 21:26.289
- Do it now.
- General.

21:30.269 --> 21:31.429
Godspeed.

21:37.810 --> 21:39.141
Boy.

21:56.895 --> 22:01.423
- <i>General? General, can you hear me?</i>
- <i>I'm here in the engine room.</i>

22:02.468 --> 22:05.460
Open the third panel down
on the center column.

22:15.447 --> 22:17.813
- Done.
- <i>You want the blue one.</i>

22:17.883 --> 22:20.408
<i>It should be located</i>
<i>at the center of the panel.</i>

22:25.958 --> 22:27.448
<i>Got it.</i>

22:28.127 --> 22:30.960
One panel up,
you should find a clear one.

22:38.937 --> 22:41.235
It's hard to tell.

22:41.306 --> 22:43.297
<i>The light in here is-</i>

22:52.584 --> 22:54.074
Something's-

22:54.920 --> 22:58.447
- General, can you hear me?
- It's only been two minutes.

22:58.524 --> 23:00.515
There was a firefight on board.

23:00.592 --> 23:02.992
If the life support
is not cycling the air-

23:04.396 --> 23:07.456
- What?
- Staff blasts give off carbon dioxide.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.524
In a small, enclosed space-

23:51.877 --> 23:54.209
General?
General. Sir?

23:59.485 --> 24:01.214
Is he breathing?

24:02.187 --> 24:04.348
He may need mouth-to-mouth.

24:20.339 --> 24:22.807
Excellent! Excellent waking up, sir!

24:23.542 --> 24:25.840
Good job on the crystals too.

24:26.578 --> 24:28.842
Get the ship moving.

24:28.914 --> 24:31.940
- What did he say?
- He said, "Get the ship moving."

24:35.621 --> 24:38.055
Come on, General.

24:38.123 --> 24:39.852
Let's get you up.

25:02.648 --> 25:04.138
Much better.

25:04.216 --> 25:06.446
Lose the weapon.
Move away from the console.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.954
I liked you better tied up.

25:10.756 --> 25:12.690
Against the wall.
Lose the weapon.

25:17.963 --> 25:21.524
- This suit still absorbs zat blasts.
- It doesn't cover your head.

25:22.768 --> 25:25.396
Still, you should probably
make me take it off.

25:25.470 --> 25:27.461
- I think I'll turn the ship around first.
- I don't know.

25:27.539 --> 25:30.030
If I had me at gunpoint,
that wouldn't be my first choice.

25:30.108 --> 25:31.598
Yeah, well-

25:41.787 --> 25:43.846
- What's goin' on?
- I rewrote the access code...

25:43.922 --> 25:46.015
so I'm the only one who can
use the navigation systems.

25:46.091 --> 25:49.026
- Undo it.
- Listen, hundreds of lives are at stake.

25:49.094 --> 25:51.995
I'm trying to save the last of my people,
and this ship is their only hope.

25:52.064 --> 25:55.693
- Maybe if you'd mentioned that earlier.
- Would you really have helped?

25:55.767 --> 25:57.894
As I was saying
before I was so rudely interrupted...

25:57.970 --> 25:59.961
we were also on a rescue mission.

26:05.677 --> 26:07.941
- What is it?
- A ship just appeared on our radar.

26:08.013 --> 26:09.742
It's an Al'kesh.

26:09.815 --> 26:11.874
This quadrant is crawling
with Goa'uld vessels.

26:11.950 --> 26:13.679
Chances are it's not your friends.

26:13.752 --> 26:16.118
I made sure that ship was fully disabled
when you showed up.

26:16.188 --> 26:18.122
We'll see.

26:18.190 --> 26:20.124
We have to raise shields
and arm weapons.

26:20.192 --> 26:22.126
I'll try to hail them first.

26:33.972 --> 26:36.304
You hit me.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.605
- You hit me.
- Yeah.

26:38.677 --> 26:40.941
You know,
we could just have sex instead.

27:17.015 --> 27:19.916
- Feeling better, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

27:20.786 --> 27:22.811
We've just caught up
to the <i>Prometheus.</i>

27:22.888 --> 27:25.857
- Nice work.
- It was all Novak, sir.

27:28.860 --> 27:30.794
They're not responding to our hail, sir.

27:58.390 --> 28:00.415
- Are we done?
- I am.

28:10.435 --> 28:12.369
You're a fruitcake.

28:35.327 --> 28:37.591
- Weapons?
- On-line. We are in range.

28:39.164 --> 28:42.531
Target the rear thrusters.
Take out her sub-light capability.

28:47.406 --> 28:49.169
She just jumped into hyperspace.

29:16.635 --> 29:18.569
That's just great.

29:31.950 --> 29:33.884
I see you.

29:39.291 --> 29:41.225
<i>Did you have fun</i>
<i>taking off my clothes?</i>

29:41.293 --> 29:44.285
- It was your idea.
- <i>I meant when I was conscious...</i>

29:44.362 --> 29:47.763
<i>you know, so I could distract you</i>
<i>and kick you in the head.</i>

29:51.536 --> 29:53.834
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

29:54.806 --> 29:57.001
<i>I'm sure you did.</i>

30:04.282 --> 30:07.740
- So, where we goin'?
- <i>I told you- to save my people.</i>

30:07.819 --> 30:10.413
<i>Can you please let me out ofhere?</i>

30:16.795 --> 30:19.696
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I haven't eaten in days.</i>

30:24.102 --> 30:28.095
Could you please tell me
how to access the navigation controls?

30:28.173 --> 30:31.233
<i>It isn't very nice, you know,</i>
<i>starving a prisoner to death.</i>

30:34.513 --> 30:36.447
<i>Come on, Daniel.</i>

30:37.149 --> 30:40.482
<i>You've seen me naked.</i>
<i>The least you could do is cook me dinner.</i>

30:50.762 --> 30:52.696
Aren't you hungry?

31:02.440 --> 31:03.930
Thank you.

31:05.076 --> 31:07.840
- You know who the Tok'ra are?
- Yep.

31:11.550 --> 31:14.713
Ten years ago, a Tok'ra incited
a rebellion on my planet.

31:16.154 --> 31:18.384
When people rose up
against the ruling Goa'uld-

31:18.456 --> 31:21.550
and once theJaffa
had been overcome-

31:21.626 --> 31:26.529
the Goa'uld was captured alive,
tortured and beaten for days on end.

31:28.033 --> 31:31.366
I was host to that Goa'uld
at the time.

31:32.037 --> 31:34.437
The people didn't understand
that it was a symbiote...

31:34.506 --> 31:36.440
that had ruled over them so harshly.

31:38.276 --> 31:40.267
I guess the Tok'ra felt responsible.

31:41.146 --> 31:44.582
He rescued me,
removed the Goa'uld symbiote...

31:45.317 --> 31:47.251
nursed me back to health.

31:50.455 --> 31:52.855
You said your people
are in trouble now.

31:55.060 --> 31:56.687
Well...

31:56.761 --> 31:59.958
it was only a matter of time before
the forces of another Goa'uld showed up-

32:00.031 --> 32:01.760
a system lord named Camulus.

32:02.834 --> 32:05.098
That's when the Tok'ra disappeared.

32:05.837 --> 32:10.297
People still refused to surrender.
Camulus ordered that they be wiped out.

32:11.376 --> 32:13.105
We controlled several ships-

32:14.145 --> 32:16.841
troop transports, cargo ships, Al'kesh.

32:16.915 --> 32:20.749
Many people were saved- flown to
an inhabitable nearby moon in the system.

32:21.853 --> 32:26.415
The ships made several trips before most
of them were intercepted and shot down.

32:27.125 --> 32:30.720
Camulus never knew there were
any survivors, so we were safe.

32:31.396 --> 32:34.763
Only problem was
the moon didn't have a Stargate.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.529
So you were trapped.

32:37.602 --> 32:41.834
We only had a few ships left,
not enough to relocate everyone again.

32:41.906 --> 32:43.635
It wasn't a problem.

32:43.708 --> 32:46.438
Camulus seemed to have little interest
in the other planets in the system.

32:46.511 --> 32:49.207
He left behind a small force
to guard the Stargate.

32:49.281 --> 32:51.272
We used the ships to keep appraised
of what was happening...

32:51.349 --> 32:55.115
and to steal supplies
and technology when we could.

32:57.756 --> 33:01.658
You know that Camulus is gone now?
He was beaten by Ba'al.

33:01.726 --> 33:06.129
And Ba'al's forces are searching every
inhabitable world in Camulus's territory.

33:06.197 --> 33:07.926
His ships are everywhere.

33:07.999 --> 33:10.331
It's only a matter of time
before my people are found.

33:10.402 --> 33:12.336
So you got desperate
and tried to steal that Al'kesh.

33:12.404 --> 33:14.338
It was damaged in the firefight.

33:16.074 --> 33:19.669
I was hoping one of my ships
would answer my distress call.

33:20.945 --> 33:24.108
I'm sure you can imagine
how lucky I felt when this ship showed up.

33:24.182 --> 33:27.379
It's big enough
to rescue all my people...

33:27.452 --> 33:31.445
and take them to a world far away,
free from the Goa'uld.

33:39.331 --> 33:42.323
- You don't have to lock me up.
- I think I do.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.334
What difference is it going to make?

33:44.402 --> 33:46.734
This ship is automatically flying
to my home world. You can't stop it.

33:46.805 --> 33:49.365
When I get to your planet,
I'll explain the situation to your people.

33:49.441 --> 33:51.170
Maybe there's something
we can work out.

33:51.242 --> 33:55.235
My people... are not gonna trust you.
You have to let me talk to them.

34:04.956 --> 34:06.981
This is bad.

34:18.703 --> 34:22.195
<i>Vala, this is Tenat.</i>
<i>We have you on our scanners.</i>

34:24.743 --> 34:27.541
- Yeah. Hi.
- <i>Where is Vala?</i>

34:29.180 --> 34:32.877
She's here. She's just...
indisposed at the moment.

34:32.951 --> 34:35.852
<i>She did not mention</i>
<i>she was working with someone.</i>

34:36.521 --> 34:38.512
No, I guess not.

34:39.257 --> 34:41.725
Look, I realize
I owe you an explanation.

34:42.761 --> 34:45.321
It's a bit of a long story really.

34:45.397 --> 34:48.560
<i>We will hear it in person</i>
<i>and inspect your vessel.</i>

34:49.234 --> 34:52.067
That's good, 'cause apparently
we're coming in for a landing.

34:52.137 --> 34:54.765
<i>We will meet you</i>
<i>at the designated coordinates.</i>

34:55.440 --> 34:57.431
Okeydokey. See ya there.

35:21.933 --> 35:23.423
Okay.

35:24.436 --> 35:27.803
You want the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.

35:30.308 --> 35:32.242
Daniel, are you there?

35:34.913 --> 35:36.847
<i>I hope you can hear me.</i>

35:36.915 --> 35:38.906
<i>The planet wejust landed on</i>
<i>is not my home world.</i>

35:38.983 --> 35:41.417
<i>Whatever you do,</i>
<i>you must not go out there.</i>

35:46.057 --> 35:49.117
- Hi, guys.
- Who are you?

35:49.194 --> 35:50.821
Name's Olo.

35:51.729 --> 35:53.356
Hans Olo.

35:55.266 --> 35:57.359
- Where is Vala?
- She's inside.

35:57.435 --> 36:01.030
- We will only do business with Vala.
- Business.

36:01.806 --> 36:03.740
Yeah, that figures.

36:04.676 --> 36:06.610
Not that I'm surprised or anything.

36:06.678 --> 36:09.738
- I don't look surprised to you, do I?
- What?

36:09.814 --> 36:13.978
It's just I was expecting some refugees
in need of transport to another planet.

36:14.052 --> 36:16.020
Human sort of refugees.

36:16.921 --> 36:19.685
Not that there's anything wrong
with you guys that I know of.

36:19.757 --> 36:21.486
We have the naquadah.

36:28.366 --> 36:31.893
- Refined weapons grade.
- That's nice.

36:31.970 --> 36:34.234
This was the price we agreed upon.

36:34.305 --> 36:36.967
This ship is impressive in size,
but we cannot-

36:37.041 --> 36:40.807
Okay, you know what? Seriously,
there's been a big misunderstanding.

36:41.613 --> 36:44.844
I don't care what you've got.
I'm not gonna sell you this ship, so-

36:44.916 --> 36:47.248
Okay, you know what?
That is not necessary.

36:47.318 --> 36:49.548
We had a deal.
We must have this ship.

36:54.926 --> 36:58.157
Goa'uld gliders!
Fool! You were followed!

36:58.229 --> 37:00.220
Of course we were.

37:03.101 --> 37:05.592
Okay, you know what? I'd love
to stay and chat, but-

37:31.029 --> 37:33.793
<i>Daniel? What's going on?</i>

37:33.865 --> 37:36.629
We're being attacked by gliders!
Tell me how to access the ship's systems!

37:36.701 --> 37:39.966
- <i>Let me out, and I'll help you.</i>
- You gotta be kidding me!

37:47.211 --> 37:50.408
Let's go. No funny stuff.

37:50.481 --> 37:53.314
- What'd you do with my buyers?
- We'll talk about that later.

37:53.384 --> 37:56.478
- And the naquadah?
- Move!

37:56.554 --> 37:59.421
Do you have any idea
what that is worth?

37:59.490 --> 38:00.980
What- Stop!

38:13.504 --> 38:15.563
All right. Raise our shields.

38:25.817 --> 38:27.580
What are you waitin' for?
Let's go to hyperspace!

38:27.652 --> 38:30.348
I can't. It's not working. We've already
taken too much hull damage.

38:30.421 --> 38:34.414
And we have incoming Al'kesh.
Arm weapons.

38:47.171 --> 38:49.162
Shields are failing.

39:02.787 --> 39:05.051
And shields are down!

39:05.123 --> 39:07.523
We are almost out of weapons.

39:15.533 --> 39:18.730
- What just happened?
- An Al'kesh just took out one of its own.

39:21.539 --> 39:24.531
Nice work, Sergeant.
Target the second Al'kesh.

39:24.609 --> 39:26.941
- Fire at will.
- Roger that, sir.

39:35.420 --> 39:36.910
<i>Dr. Jackson?</i>

39:36.988 --> 39:38.979
<i>This is General Hammond.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

39:44.929 --> 39:46.863
General, it's me.

39:46.931 --> 39:48.762
<i>Good to hear your voice, sir.</i>

39:48.833 --> 39:51.165
Likewise. You all right, son?

39:55.606 --> 39:59.406
- We are fine, sir.
- Are we clear to ring aboard?

40:00.511 --> 40:02.604
Stand by. Unlock the system.

40:03.848 --> 40:05.941
Those gliders likely retreated
to a nearby mother ship.

40:06.017 --> 40:08.417
We have to get out of here now.
Unlock the system.

40:16.594 --> 40:18.528
You're all clear, sir.

40:26.270 --> 40:28.204
What are you gonna do with me?

40:33.478 --> 40:35.412
I'm not sure.

40:38.583 --> 40:40.380
Look, Daniel.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.086
Whatever happens,
I just want you to know-

41:06.277 --> 41:08.643
We managed to get the shields
and hyperdrive back on-line.

41:08.713 --> 41:10.806
However, there was
significant hull damage.

41:10.882 --> 41:13.009
I wouldn't recommend
a long journey in hyperspace.

41:13.084 --> 41:15.211
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to return to Earth.

41:15.286 --> 41:17.015
How long before the ship's
ready to go again?

41:17.088 --> 41:18.817
Hard to say.

41:18.890 --> 41:21.654
It's good work, Doctor,
both here and on the Al'kesh.

41:21.726 --> 41:23.455
Thank you, sir.

41:24.362 --> 41:27.695
Hey. Hiccups are gone, huh?

41:28.766 --> 41:31.701
I didn't even notice.
I guess I was having too much fun.

41:31.769 --> 41:33.498
<i>Security team to Level 4.</i>

41:33.571 --> 41:36.506
- <i>The prisoner has escaped.</i>
- Ring room.

41:41.712 --> 41:43.202
Wow.

41:45.917 --> 41:49.250
- Status?
- Security Team 1 unresponsive.

41:51.823 --> 41:53.848
Rings on Level 4 just activated, sir.

42:08.206 --> 42:11.141
General Hammond?
SG-3 was just transported here.

42:11.876 --> 42:13.810
<i>She's on the Al'kesh.</i>

42:18.282 --> 42:21.718
- Lock weapons on its engines.
- Aft thrusters targeted.

42:23.654 --> 42:25.144
Target is-

42:29.093 --> 42:30.822
It's gone, sir.

42:31.896 --> 42:35.093
- Can we track it?
- No, sir.

42:35.166 --> 42:38.431
Our long-range scanners
are being scrambled.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.530
She's good.
