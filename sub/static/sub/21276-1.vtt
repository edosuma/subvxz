02:18.408 --> 02:21.310
Essentially, Genetic Engineering

02:21.312 --> 02:24.680
is selecting the best of what we can be.

02:24.682 --> 02:27.216
Not tampering at all.

02:27.218 --> 02:31.721
But that's what we're talking about.
If we were able to recode

02:31.723 --> 02:36.359
DNA, DNA that once altered,
would pass its defenses

02:36.361 --> 02:38.427
permanently to its offspring,

02:38.429 --> 02:38.427
think of the health costs we could save

02:38.429 --> 02:42.698
if we had a read-out that
showed when, I don't know,

02:42.700 --> 02:44.934
our blood sugar levels were too high

02:44.936 --> 02:46.769
or sodium levels, or whatever.

02:46.771 --> 02:50.873
Businesses would save billions a year

02:50.875 --> 02:53.943
because employees wouldn't need sick leave.

02:53.945 --> 03:01.384
Actually... Maybe progress is bad.

03:06.524 --> 03:09.892
This is unorthodox.

03:09.894 --> 03:12.361
Friend of a friend's Rumspringa.

03:12.363 --> 03:14.463
I thought you said he was a Quaker.

03:14.465 --> 03:16.499
Yeah, that's what I said.

03:16.501 --> 03:18.568
Rumspringa's Amish.

03:33.952 --> 03:39.956
We're all doing kickstands...

03:39.958 --> 03:43.826
One of my best friends...

03:57.874 --> 03:59.508
Hey, can I get a beer?

03:59.510 --> 04:01.711
Uh, yeah sure.

04:02.980 --> 04:05.715
Seth did you want it in your hands?

04:05.717 --> 04:09.318
Umm, is there the option for a cup, or?

04:09.320 --> 04:13.589
I mean, we had cups...

04:13.591 --> 04:16.659
Um... Well where's your cup?

04:16.661 --> 04:20.463
I'm just in charge of
distribution for tonight.

04:20.464 --> 04:23.566
The responsible one. Respect.

04:23.568 --> 04:25.534
Irregardless, it's my lot in life.

04:25.536 --> 04:28.271
Ah, but irregardless means regardless,

04:28.273 --> 04:30.906
and there's no such thing as the former.

04:30.908 --> 04:35.678
Ahahahah, holy shit. Uh, impressive. Hi.

04:35.680 --> 04:36.412
Hi.

04:36.414 --> 04:36.946
Seth.

04:36.948 --> 04:36.946
Em.

04:36.948 --> 04:40.850
Em... Is that short for Emily?

04:40.852 --> 04:45.788
Normal length for em, actually.

04:45.790 --> 04:45.788
This is, um,

04:45.790 --> 04:50.626
interesting music for a
rite of passage party.

04:50.628 --> 04:53.029
What would make you think
that was the case?

04:53.031 --> 04:55.898
My friend, Rach, over there.

04:55.900 --> 05:00.603
Making out with six guys over there.

05:00.605 --> 05:02.905
Oh yeah, she's very, uh...

05:02.907 --> 05:04.640
kind... She's a... social...

05:04.642 --> 05:07.810
Yeah, social... Nice person.

05:07.812 --> 05:11.414
So is it Rach, or...

05:11.416 --> 05:13.716
Rachel, actually.

05:13.718 --> 05:16.852
Nice to check in with that though.

05:16.854 --> 05:18.020
So what kind of music did you

05:18.022 --> 05:19.955
think we'd be playing, like cat Stevens?

05:19.957 --> 05:23.359
Yes, I love cat Stevens.

05:23.361 --> 05:25.061
Why isn't there cat Stevens? Now I'm, now

05:25.063 --> 05:27.430
I'm a little disappointed
that there's not cat Stevens.

05:27.432 --> 05:28.764
No, he's great.

05:28.766 --> 05:31.867
I'm more into like classical music.

05:31.869 --> 05:34.370
Pachelbel's canon, stuff like that.

05:34.372 --> 05:36.339
The... That's the wedding
song, right, the...?

05:36.341 --> 05:37.873
Yeah, yes, exactly.

05:37.875 --> 05:37.873
Very nice. I used to be able

05:37.875 --> 05:41.877
to play that on the piano
when I was like, eight.

05:42.346 --> 05:44.480
And super grammar nerd, awesome.

05:44.482 --> 05:47.616
Nah, this is sort of just like
a regular party with, like,

05:47.618 --> 05:49.952
good old farm boys.

05:49.954 --> 05:49.952
Farm boys.

05:49.954 --> 05:53.923
Jacob over there, he's
actually like a real Quaker.

05:53.925 --> 05:55.558
He's even got like the
lamb chops to prove it.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.761
Oh yeah? And his name is Jacob.

05:58.763 --> 06:03.366
That's freakin' perfect.

06:07.104 --> 06:09.939
So I gotta head back to my truck to...

06:09.941 --> 06:10.673
Okay.

06:10.675 --> 06:12.007
Get another keg.

06:12.009 --> 06:12.007
It was nice meeting you.

06:12.009 --> 06:17.046
Um... There might be more cups in the cab

06:17.048 --> 06:18.047
if you're still interested.

06:18.049 --> 06:20.449
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:20.451 --> 06:21.851
Picture me rollin'.

06:21.853 --> 06:24.086
Okay. Truck's on.

06:24.088 --> 06:24.086
What next?

06:24.088 --> 06:29.959
Okay, now by your left foot,
there's the parking brake.

06:29.961 --> 06:30.993
It's kinda sticky.

06:30.995 --> 06:34.597
Okay, hold on.

06:34.599 --> 06:35.731
Ahaha, okay, wow.

06:35.733 --> 06:38.601
- That?
- Huh, uh, yes.

06:38.603 --> 06:41.937
'Kay.

06:41.939 --> 06:44.106
Okay. Is your foot on the brake?

06:44.108 --> 06:46.142
Mm hmm, we're not rolling, are we?

06:46.144 --> 06:47.576
No. Okay.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.545
All good.

06:49.547 --> 06:51.647
All right, now take your
left foot and press

06:51.649 --> 06:52.748
down on the clutch.

06:52.750 --> 06:52.748
'Kay.

06:52.750 --> 06:56.018
And put it into gear.

06:56.620 --> 06:56.619
All right.

06:56.621 --> 07:02.124
And now just release the
clutch slowly and...

07:02.126 --> 07:03.926
Lightly tap on the gas.

07:05.463 --> 07:06.762
Hahahaha...

07:06.764 --> 07:08.931
shit. I'm sorry.

07:08.933 --> 07:08.931
Oh, no sweat.

07:08.933 --> 07:13.002
I should probably get back
with the keg anyways.

07:13.004 --> 07:15.471
But uh, yeah, thanks.

07:15.473 --> 07:17.206
I said sorry.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.742
No, I mean thanks for hangin' out with

07:19.744 --> 07:22.211
a fellow teetotaler tonight.

07:22.213 --> 07:27.616
It was fun, even if it was
just for a short time.

07:27.618 --> 07:31.487
Well maybe we can extend it to another day.

07:34.224 --> 07:36.025
Yeah, I have, uh, class a lot,

07:36.027 --> 07:38.794
but the weekend would work.

07:38.796 --> 07:40.696
What's, uh, what's your cell?

07:40.698 --> 07:42.064
I don't have one.

07:42.066 --> 07:46.635
I have a land line, with
protruding buttons and stuff.

07:46.638 --> 07:47.537
Wow.

07:47.538 --> 07:54.677
Here. You can write it down
with this antiquated gadget.

07:54.679 --> 07:56.479
I call a pen.

07:56.481 --> 07:59.582
Oh, you don't have a quill or anything?

07:59.584 --> 08:07.823
Uh, no. It's way too messy.

08:07.825 --> 08:08.757
Thank you.

08:08.759 --> 08:08.757
Yeah. I'll bring

08:08.759 --> 08:15.564
a cat Stevens tape for
your fancy tape deck.

08:19.236 --> 08:20.836
Hi, this is em.

08:20.838 --> 08:23.072
Em, it's me. Or, uh,

08:23.074 --> 08:23.072
Seth from the other night.

08:23.074 --> 08:26.609
Hi, I didn't know if I'd
hear from you or not.

08:26.611 --> 08:28.677
I have to cancel our plans this Saturday.

08:28.679 --> 08:29.778
Okay.

08:29.780 --> 08:32.181
My Dad, he, he had a stroke.

08:32.183 --> 08:34.650
Oh my god. Are you all...

08:34.652 --> 08:36.784
Is there anything I can do?
Are you all right?

08:36.787 --> 08:40.022
I don't think so. My mom's
having a tough time, so...

08:40.024 --> 08:44.293
I'm so sorry. Jesus, um... Look, I

08:44.295 --> 08:46.061
lost my Mom when I was little,

08:46.063 --> 08:48.531
so if there's anything
you want to talk about.

08:48.533 --> 08:52.601
Okay, um, we're praying
for a good recovery.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.537
Listen, I gotta go. The doctor's out now.

08:54.539 --> 08:55.871
He just wants to chat with me and Mom.

08:55.873 --> 08:56.839
Okay.

08:56.841 --> 08:57.873
Thanks

08:57.875 --> 09:01.010
bye.

09:03.948 --> 09:06.015
Whazzup.

09:07.117 --> 09:08.817
Disen-fucking-Gage dude!

09:08.819 --> 09:12.121
Just a second!

09:12.123 --> 09:13.589
You bitch!

09:13.591 --> 09:21.297
You're missing actual life.

09:51.762 --> 09:54.096
You ready to go home now?

09:54.098 --> 09:57.066
I'm so ready.

10:28.365 --> 10:36.138
Mixed with somber music

11:24.120 --> 11:25.754
hi.

11:25.756 --> 11:30.025
Hey, I'm sorry. It's just
it's been a long, long day.

11:30.027 --> 11:34.830
My Mom had me do a bunch of stuff for her.

11:34.832 --> 11:36.699
Coulda' texted.

11:36.701 --> 11:40.002
Forgot to turn the damn thing on again.

11:40.004 --> 11:43.238
Have you even used it once
since I got it for you?

11:52.048 --> 11:54.950
Has she thought any more
about selling the farm?

11:55.218 --> 11:57.753
I don't know where she's at with that, em.

11:57.755 --> 12:01.256
Like I don't think she's in the
right place for that right now.

12:04.994 --> 12:08.230
I, I mean she probably just
thinks it's disloyal to my Dad.

12:08.232 --> 12:12.134
Well, but it's not. It
wouldn't be giving up.

12:17.073 --> 12:20.142
You're gonna kill us.

12:20.144 --> 12:24.747
Thought about, you know,
doin' anything else?

12:24.749 --> 12:29.318
Bills first. Then figure out
how to conquer the world.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.955
Unless you're insinuating
I go to school with you.

12:32.957 --> 12:35.424
Get me one of them higher educations.

12:37.794 --> 12:39.762
Yeah.

12:40.029 --> 12:45.234
I'm gonna have all of my
pieces end up here eventually.

12:49.172 --> 12:52.007
Nice. You shake it harder,
you get bigger numbers.

12:52.009 --> 12:56.812
Oh, I'll have to try that.

12:56.814 --> 13:00.816
I was thinking of going to seminary.

13:03.419 --> 13:05.988
It's kinda something my,
parents always wanted for me.

13:05.990 --> 13:09.491
I mean that was the plan... Before.

13:12.362 --> 13:16.431
Ouch. Mid-move even.

13:19.903 --> 13:24.106
Can't believe you're telling
me this in a seedy hotel room.

13:24.108 --> 13:27.442
A seedy hotel... this is like our go-to.

13:27.444 --> 13:29.144
In the middle of some Podunk town.

13:29.146 --> 13:31.180
This is right in between us.

13:31.182 --> 13:33.582
Like what, you want to go
back to your, your place

13:33.584 --> 13:36.952
and do this with your
roommate like two feet away?

13:39.355 --> 13:42.424
She might want next game.

13:49.999 --> 13:52.067
Your turn.

14:00.344 --> 14:04.546
You just gonna shut off
every time this comes up?

14:05.415 --> 14:08.483
Hmmm?

14:14.490 --> 14:16.558
Stop.

14:18.561 --> 14:19.394
Come on.

14:19.396 --> 14:23.465
Hey, mister!

14:26.269 --> 14:28.871
You know if my Mom saw those...

14:30.473 --> 14:33.275
Yeah.

14:33.877 --> 14:35.477
What's, what's with you tonight?

14:35.479 --> 14:38.447
What's with you? You're picking on me.

14:38.449 --> 14:41.950
I am? No, I'm crazy about you.

14:41.952 --> 14:43.886
And your star tattoos.

14:43.888 --> 14:45.120
Now you're making fun of me?

14:45.122 --> 14:48.190
I'm not making fun of you.
I'm crazy about you.

14:59.469 --> 15:05.374
So you still going back to,
going back home for...

15:05.376 --> 15:07.442
For holiday break?

15:08.444 --> 15:10.612
Unfortunately.

15:10.614 --> 15:14.449
I feel like I should. At least be a sport.

15:14.451 --> 15:17.252
You could come with me,
unless you have to...

15:17.254 --> 15:19.621
Yeah, I probably shouldn't.

15:19.623 --> 15:21.323
I don't know, I just want everything to run

15:21.325 --> 15:24.593
smooth through Christmas.

15:24.595 --> 15:27.663
It's only like two weeks, right?

15:30.667 --> 15:37.272
I just feel like my Dad
barely knows I'm there.

15:39.042 --> 15:44.479
You know, like ever since
my Mom died he's all

15:44.481 --> 15:46.615
about work and we just barely talk.

15:46.617 --> 15:49.117
He sends checks to school.

15:49.119 --> 15:54.256
I go home for holidays.
We check those boxes.

16:03.199 --> 16:07.569
Probably keeps him going though.
Enjoys his time.

16:07.571 --> 16:11.340
It's good of you to see him.
It sucks losing

16:11.342 --> 16:18.580
a parent. I think god provides.

16:27.256 --> 16:29.124
Well, aren't you cute?

16:29.126 --> 16:33.595
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:56.719 --> 16:58.787
You a college student?

16:59.489 --> 16:59.488
Sorry?

16:59.490 --> 17:02.190
You guys on your winter break?

17:02.192 --> 17:05.027
Yeah, headed home for the holidays.

17:06.162 --> 17:08.230
You know when I was in school, we didn't...

17:08.232 --> 17:09.698
I said when I was in school, we didn't have

17:09.700 --> 17:11.433
all the breaks that you guys have.

17:11.435 --> 17:11.433
No?

17:11.435 --> 17:14.502
No, we had, we had, Christmas break.

17:14.505 --> 17:17.439
I guess now it's called holiday break, huh?

17:17.441 --> 17:19.340
Mmhm. Well, even with all the breaks,

17:19.343 --> 17:23.178
I'll still be doing plenty of studying.

17:23.180 --> 17:23.178
Not too much.

17:23.180 --> 17:27.648
You have some fun too, you hear?

17:30.686 --> 17:32.788
My hands are too antiquated

17:32.790 --> 17:38.393
for those new machines. Oh look
at, arthritic and fat fingers,

17:38.395 --> 17:39.761
like a bear paw.

17:39.763 --> 17:42.130
Just blame it on the auto correct.

17:42.132 --> 17:43.298
On the what?

17:43.300 --> 17:45.367
The auto correct.

17:45.369 --> 17:47.135
You know, when it tries to...

17:47.137 --> 17:50.205
I, I don't know what that
means, but hell, I'll take it.

17:50.207 --> 17:50.839
Okay.

17:50.841 --> 17:53.108
You are a cutie.

18:22.839 --> 18:26.208
Mmmm...

18:45.661 --> 18:48.130
I'll go over to the hospital
administrator for her

18:48.132 --> 18:50.832
release to us then.

18:59.642 --> 19:01.743
I told the boy.

19:01.745 --> 19:03.712
Boy?

19:03.714 --> 19:05.580
Her boyfriend.

19:05.582 --> 19:06.715
She had a boyfriend?

19:06.717 --> 19:09.818
Has, Roy. She has.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.553
What'd you tell him?

19:11.555 --> 19:14.823
It was me. I told Sofia to tell him to

19:14.825 --> 19:16.625
say his goodbyes.

19:16.627 --> 19:16.625
Goodbyes?

19:16.627 --> 19:21.296
As far as he knows.
- You know man, for closure.

19:21.298 --> 19:21.296
Well, couldn't you just have told

19:21.298 --> 19:24.299
him visiting hours are over?

19:24.301 --> 19:28.470
You see, this is why you
have me do these things.

19:28.472 --> 19:31.439
It's probably appropriate
that Sofia did it.

19:31.441 --> 19:33.542
She's a lot more diplomatic
than you are, Hank.

19:33.544 --> 19:35.744
I know I can be a rough around the edges.

19:35.746 --> 19:38.847
Excuse me... Hello?

19:38.849 --> 19:44.486
Hold on a second. Hey guys,
she's my daughter, okay?

20:18.955 --> 20:21.223
Good to go.

20:47.283 --> 20:49.584
I just really hope what we're
doing is the right thing, Hank.

20:49.586 --> 20:51.253
Hope isn't a plan, Roy.

20:51.255 --> 20:52.954
And what we're doing is putting her in

20:52.956 --> 20:55.390
the best position to survive.

20:58.327 --> 21:00.395
Janie was the give.

21:00.997 --> 21:05.767
After she died, I didn't
know how to raise em.

21:06.702 --> 21:09.771
I was a shitty father.

21:10.940 --> 21:16.311
I love em. You know I do.
I've know her since what,

21:16.313 --> 21:19.347
since she was three years old.

21:20.883 --> 21:23.618
And I remember how it was with Janie.

21:24.387 --> 21:27.322
And I'm gonna do everything in my power

21:27.324 --> 21:29.491
to help you bring em back and give her a

21:29.493 --> 21:31.960
long and healthy life.

21:36.799 --> 21:40.869
Unhhh, goddammit, let there be light.

21:43.372 --> 21:45.640
I thought we made the decision
by bringing her here.

22:14.804 --> 22:17.672
Hey, Phillip, what's goin' on?
- I got my Mom in the truck.

22:17.674 --> 22:19.741
We just got back from seeing my Dad.

22:19.743 --> 22:23.745
Geez, Louise, that's just...
- It's been a tough year for you.

22:23.747 --> 22:25.780
Yeah, it's been a rough one.

22:25.782 --> 22:25.780
Look, I wanna thank you for your help.

22:25.782 --> 22:28.983
I know my Mom... she appreciates it too.

22:28.985 --> 22:31.986
Well, you think about what I said, okay?

22:31.988 --> 22:33.722
I just sort of feel responsible to make an

22:33.724 --> 22:36.358
offer, you know, given as how
your Dad was so good to me

22:36.360 --> 22:38.593
when I was getting started farming.

22:38.595 --> 22:40.428
I tell ya, I wouldn't have
been nearly as successful

22:40.430 --> 22:42.364
without his guidance.

22:42.366 --> 22:45.800
I, I don't see how you gonna
be able to run this place

22:45.802 --> 22:48.136
all by yourself.

22:48.138 --> 22:52.574
Aagh, I don't know, I... It's
just I think my Mom will want to

22:52.576 --> 22:53.775
hold on to the farm, if we can.

22:53.777 --> 22:55.009
Not that we don't appreciate your help.

22:55.011 --> 22:58.580
No, hey, hey, no, don't feel bad about it.

22:58.582 --> 23:01.383
You guys could stay here.

23:01.385 --> 23:03.718
I could use the expansion
to be honest with you.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.620
I really could.

23:05.622 --> 23:07.155
We'd have to clean things
up around here though.

23:07.157 --> 23:09.557
I mean, this place, it's seen better

23:09.559 --> 23:11.559
days, that's for sure.

23:11.561 --> 23:15.463
I mean seriously, we need
a yard sale or somethin'.

23:15.465 --> 23:16.898
"Cause I got, you know,

23:16.900 --> 23:18.933
I got a vision for this here.

23:18.935 --> 23:22.003
This could make an awesome, uh...

23:23.806 --> 23:25.807
Well you just think about it.

23:25.809 --> 23:27.409
Yeah, I don't...

23:27.411 --> 23:28.676
Take your time. Don't, don't go lookin'

23:28.678 --> 23:30.745
for rats in the attic.

23:30.747 --> 23:32.514
Alright, take care of your Mom, all right?

23:32.516 --> 23:33.148
Yeah.

23:33.150 --> 23:33.982
I know you will.

23:33.984 --> 23:34.816
Yeah.

23:34.818 --> 23:44.826
I know you will.

24:07.850 --> 24:11.920
- We're gonna be all right.
- We'll be fine.

24:16.721 --> 24:17.860
Even if we weren't,

24:17.861 --> 24:21.095
it's not like that would
be my fault, since Dad

24:21.097 --> 24:25.166
sort of left us in financial shambles.

24:29.972 --> 24:32.640
What?

24:35.578 --> 24:37.979
Okay.

24:37.981 --> 24:39.647
Never go to bed on your anger, right?

24:39.649 --> 24:42.116
That's what you've always said.

24:44.053 --> 24:46.821
I'm sorry.

24:53.762 --> 24:56.831
Have a good night, all right, Mom? Love ya.

26:09.905 --> 26:16.978
I feel like we're stuck at
the beginning with her, Roy.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.914
What happened the other night?
Did you ever go home?

26:19.916 --> 26:25.753
Oh, it's a nightmare.
- Perfectly common, right?

26:25.755 --> 26:29.691
You know... same thing
happened with the soldiers.

26:31.327 --> 26:33.728
I feel like I'm in grade school.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.201
Let's be honest. She's not progressing

26:40.203 --> 26:42.270
the way we want her to.

26:43.772 --> 26:47.275
What is it exactly that we do want, Hank?

26:52.781 --> 26:55.950
Better sandwiches.

26:57.219 --> 26:58.219
Come on.

26:58.221 --> 27:01.122
All right.

27:01.124 --> 27:03.291
I'm just sayin', the board would
like to see some improvement.

27:03.293 --> 27:03.291
Yeah, I'm just trying
to improve my daughter.

27:03.293 --> 27:07.362
I guess I should be trying
to improve P/E ratios.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.997
I meant improving the
way they were thinking.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.231
Oh, the way they were thinking?

27:10.233 --> 27:13.001
Oh, relax. I want what's best for em too.

27:13.003 --> 27:14.669
Uh huh.

27:14.671 --> 27:16.638
Keep in mind we're under
significant pressure

27:16.640 --> 27:19.874
prove our worth. To prove that
all these years of research

27:19.876 --> 27:22.343
and development have not been in vain.

27:22.345 --> 27:25.079
We have profits to meet or
we'll lose our subsidies.

27:25.081 --> 27:26.648
Now em is in a prime spot for us...

27:26.650 --> 27:29.651
Prime spot. Life at all costs.
Is that it Hank?

27:29.653 --> 27:31.185
Last time I checked,

27:31.187 --> 27:33.855
I made this happen. I'm overseeing this.

27:33.857 --> 27:36.824
She's not a lab rat. No
one's thinking that. Relax.

27:36.826 --> 27:38.226
She's... She's my daughter.

27:38.228 --> 27:40.361
Yes, and I'm appealing
to you as your friend,

27:40.363 --> 27:42.764
on behalf of her.

27:43.032 --> 27:45.800
She's suffering and I think
it's halting her progress.

27:45.802 --> 27:48.169
Okay. So?

27:48.171 --> 27:49.771
Hear me out.

27:50.072 --> 27:51.839
She has classic signs of PTSD.

27:51.841 --> 27:53.941
I know. We've given her
medication for that.

27:53.943 --> 27:56.277
But they're not working,
so I think her condition,

27:56.279 --> 28:00.148
her suffering, is keeping her
from moving beyond the accident.

28:00.150 --> 28:02.417
From further developing.
Now we saw it before.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.887
If we can block those memories...
we saw in prior

28:05.889 --> 28:08.156
cases, they would jump light years ahead.

28:08.158 --> 28:10.391
How can you call those
experiments successful?

28:10.393 --> 28:10.391
That was year's ago.

28:10.393 --> 28:15.163
We, we can dial it in.
We can pinpoint this.

28:15.165 --> 28:18.232
All right, so yes, I am
for life at all costs.

28:19.835 --> 28:24.238
I don't mean to be cold here,
but all this being emotional

28:24.240 --> 28:26.841
it's hurting her.

28:28.043 --> 28:31.112
Maybe you need to relinquish control to me.

28:32.448 --> 28:34.982
Let me oversee it.

28:34.984 --> 28:37.018
I can easily vacillate between what's

28:37.020 --> 28:40.354
good for em, and what's
good for singularity.

28:40.356 --> 28:44.992
And I'll handle it with kid gloves.

28:44.994 --> 28:47.061
Now we say to our colleagues all the time,

28:47.063 --> 28:49.797
we have to remain objective
to yield the best

28:49.799 --> 28:52.834
results. Now we're 99
percent of the way there.

28:52.836 --> 28:55.236
All we need is one little nudge.

28:55.471 --> 28:57.472
This is your opportunity to
do what you couldn't do for

28:57.474 --> 28:59.874
your wife.

29:27.069 --> 29:31.172
Over the course of the last two
years, we've had to make some

29:31.174 --> 29:33.107
alterations so that you would
survive what would have been

29:33.109 --> 29:41.182
by normal standards, a fatal crash...
Adaptations.

29:43.786 --> 29:45.186
A Neuro chip implanted in

29:45.188 --> 29:49.223
your brain to replace the
non-recoverable damage.

29:54.163 --> 29:56.397
Most of your functioning
and memory are, for

29:56.399 --> 30:04.005
what we know, still intact.

30:11.848 --> 30:15.016
Your left eye was blinded,
so we replaced it with

30:15.018 --> 30:18.085
an artificial optic that
connects to your brain implant.

30:18.087 --> 30:23.157
It will not only restore your
vision, but should enhance it.

30:25.928 --> 30:29.297
Additional adaptations including
synthetic organ replacement to

30:29.299 --> 30:34.569
your right lung, part of your
stomach and both kidneys.

30:38.907 --> 30:40.842
Nanobot injections were
given to replace much of

30:40.844 --> 30:45.513
your red blood cells and to
coincide with what remains.

30:51.555 --> 30:52.454
As a result...

30:52.455 --> 30:56.123
We should not only restore
your body's faculties to full

30:56.125 --> 31:00.061
capacity, but also enhance
and potentially prolong your

31:00.063 --> 31:02.930
life.

31:26.321 --> 31:30.358
Like a computer, this new
technology will enable

31:30.360 --> 31:32.627
you to instinctively know
the shortest possible

31:32.629 --> 31:35.229
routes between locations.

31:39.334 --> 31:41.636
Much like a bee's amazing
navigational skills,

31:41.638 --> 31:44.538
there will be no wrong turns.

31:44.540 --> 31:47.608
No second guessing.

31:52.648 --> 31:55.416
Your very own internal GPS.

32:04.983 --> 32:06.662
Those are pre-augment scars.

32:06.663 --> 32:13.301
They'll likely never go away,
but they'll fade with time.

32:13.303 --> 32:16.671
You wanna get out of here, I know that.
You need to.

32:16.673 --> 32:20.374
You just have to, uh, give me some time and

32:20.376 --> 32:24.045
then we'll re-evaluate. If
it were up to me, you'd be

32:24.047 --> 32:28.349
outta here tomorrow, but
that's not my decision.

32:31.119 --> 32:32.153
Dad?

32:32.155 --> 32:34.522
Did... Give it time, em.

32:43.398 --> 32:45.967
Ma'am?

32:54.710 --> 32:57.111
Whoa, whoa! You Seth?

32:57.113 --> 32:58.546
Yeah, well she's not.

32:58.548 --> 33:01.082
I'm with the bank, regarding your mortgage.

33:01.550 --> 33:04.385
I just need you to sign this.

33:04.653 --> 33:06.354
Can you put the gun down, please?

33:06.356 --> 33:09.357
It's a rifle. For vermin.

33:09.359 --> 33:11.325
'Kay.

33:12.394 --> 33:15.563
You know, you guys can't
bury my Dad any deeper.

33:15.565 --> 33:18.566
It's a final notice on your farm.

33:19.401 --> 33:23.137
Sorry about this, but you're
delinquent over a year now.

33:25.407 --> 33:28.709
I just need you to sign this.
That you received this.

33:31.279 --> 33:32.413
We've been calling. You guys don't have

33:32.415 --> 33:32.413
a machine or anything?

33:32.415 --> 33:36.384
Who do I talk to about an extension? Jordy?

33:36.386 --> 33:38.552
Sorry about that. Here you go. Here.

33:38.554 --> 33:41.022
Why didn't Jordy come tell me?

33:41.024 --> 33:41.022
You talking about Jordan Chamberlain?

33:41.024 --> 33:44.625
Yes, the same guy who gave
us the extension last time.

33:44.627 --> 33:46.360
You, you'd have to speak
with him about that.

33:46.362 --> 33:48.596
I'm with special credits.
I'm only sent out when

33:48.598 --> 33:51.565
it's time to, you know, act.

33:51.567 --> 33:53.634
Regulations.

33:56.104 --> 33:57.505
Thank you.

33:57.507 --> 33:59.774
Yeah, speak with Jordan if
you have any issues and, uh,

33:59.776 --> 34:03.044
go ahead and keep that pen, okay?

34:09.217 --> 34:11.485
Who was that joker that was
at my house this morning?

34:11.487 --> 34:12.820
Like I thought the extension
was still good...

34:12.822 --> 34:15.255
That was before he passed.

34:15.257 --> 34:17.725
We still extended you last time.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.661
Let me ask, what's going on with the farm

34:20.663 --> 34:22.263
subsidies that you applied for?

34:22.264 --> 34:24.098
Yeah, that would have been nice, huh?

34:24.100 --> 34:26.600
We had no problems getting
subsidies when I was growing up,

34:26.601 --> 34:29.804
before he passed, but now
suddenly I'm getting the run

34:29.806 --> 34:32.473
around. Hell, I had a friend
that lost his farm because

34:32.475 --> 34:35.342
they wanted to build cell
towers or something.

34:35.344 --> 34:39.413
So, that's not a viable option,
I take it, getting a subsidy.

34:39.415 --> 34:43.117
Look, I just, I... I need more time.

34:43.119 --> 34:45.853
Maybe an extension. I've given up

34:45.855 --> 34:48.656
everything I have to sit there
and try to make this work.

34:49.291 --> 34:52.326
Why? What's gonna change?

34:52.328 --> 34:54.428
You, you tell me.

34:54.429 --> 34:58.632
I'm just the pilot here, Seth.
I didn't build the plane,

34:58.634 --> 35:01.435
and I don't control the weather.

35:01.603 --> 35:01.602
I just...

35:01.604 --> 35:05.239
With or without your Dad,
your film is still hurting.

35:05.241 --> 35:07.408
He was sitting across from
me, just like you are.

35:07.410 --> 35:07.408
Yeah, except he was sitting across

35:07.410 --> 35:11.178
from someone older than
you, before you were here.

35:11.180 --> 35:13.347
Someone that knew how to make
a deal based upon a promise

35:13.349 --> 35:15.583
and a handshake.

35:15.851 --> 35:18.185
What's this?

35:18.187 --> 35:22.123
Calm down, Seth. He's just checking in.

35:22.125 --> 35:25.126
We've already made the decision.

35:25.128 --> 35:27.194
If you can't come up
with the back payments,

35:27.196 --> 35:30.464
we're gonna have to take the next step.

35:35.403 --> 35:38.539
You just killed my Mom, then. Thank you.

36:38.967 --> 36:48.943
Hey, Seth. How you doin'?
- I know you're upset.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.945
Hey, don't beat yourself up, you know?

36:50.947 --> 36:53.314
There's really not a whole
lot else you coulda' done.

36:53.316 --> 36:57.384
I tell ya, these family farms
are getting, they're just

36:57.386 --> 37:00.788
getting replaced by the big factory farms.

37:00.790 --> 37:02.289
There's just no way we can keep up with

37:02.291 --> 37:04.959
that kind of production.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.595
Hey.

37:07.597 --> 37:10.564
It's no wonder we can't
pay our bills, right?

37:10.566 --> 37:13.434
You seem to be doing fine.

37:13.436 --> 37:16.637
Well yeah, today, maybe,
but what about tomorrow?

37:16.805 --> 37:19.974
You just remember, I got
your back, all right?

37:19.976 --> 37:22.409
And you're gonna be way
better off having me own that

37:22.411 --> 37:24.245
farm than uncle Sam.

37:24.247 --> 37:25.646
And I'm just holdin' on to it for you

37:25.648 --> 37:28.616
til you get on your feet again, right?

37:29.884 --> 37:33.954
Usual hot water in a mug,
140 degrees with honey?

37:33.956 --> 37:37.424
You got it, Amber.

37:37.426 --> 37:38.959
Oh, oh Amber?

37:38.961 --> 37:40.461
Uh, what are you having, Seth? I'm buying.

37:40.463 --> 37:41.629
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.

37:41.631 --> 37:42.563
Come on, you sure?

37:42.565 --> 37:43.697
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:43.699 --> 37:45.299
Amber, you got any of that good chili?

37:45.301 --> 37:46.300
Three alarm?

37:46.302 --> 37:47.968
Yeah. Yeah get him a bowl.

37:47.970 --> 37:48.769
If he don't eat it, I will.

37:51.340 --> 37:53.507
God, I love this place.

37:53.509 --> 37:56.577
It's just the way things should be.

37:58.013 --> 38:01.548
Is there something else bothering you?

38:05.820 --> 38:09.456
When I was looking for the deed tonight,

38:09.458 --> 38:11.825
I kinda came across my old
girlfriend's obituary.

38:11.827 --> 38:14.828
Oh man, I'm sorry.

38:14.830 --> 38:15.829
Yeah.

38:15.831 --> 38:18.899
How's her family gettin' on?

38:20.368 --> 38:22.670
None really to speak of,
except for, I mean,

38:22.672 --> 38:25.439
except for her Dad.

38:25.441 --> 38:26.907
Have you talked to him?

38:26.909 --> 38:31.912
Uh... We never really knew each other.

38:31.914 --> 38:34.915
Plus, I don't really think I'm
his cup of tea, you know?

38:34.917 --> 38:36.483
Well why is that?

38:36.485 --> 38:38.652
Farm boy, Phillip. He's like some big

38:38.654 --> 38:40.888
wig bio tech guy.

38:40.890 --> 38:43.390
Thank you, Amber.

38:45.060 --> 38:49.797
So hot water and honey, huh?
No coffee or tea?

38:49.799 --> 38:51.031
Nope.

38:51.033 --> 38:53.767
I don't need no artificial stimulants.

38:53.769 --> 38:56.503
Not me.

38:56.505 --> 38:59.106
I don't think caffeine's artificial.

38:59.108 --> 39:03.043
Don't be a smart ass. You
know what I'm talkin' about.

39:03.045 --> 39:05.612
So, bio tech, huh?

39:05.614 --> 39:07.614
Where'd you say he worked?

39:07.616 --> 39:10.050
Singularity.

39:10.052 --> 39:11.118
Are you kiddin' me?

39:11.120 --> 39:12.453
No.

39:12.455 --> 39:14.555
You know what they do there?

39:14.557 --> 39:15.989
Those are them guys that are doing all

39:15.991 --> 39:15.989
that, that crazy...

39:15.991 --> 39:19.660
Look... Listen, em and I, you
know, we didn't see eye to

39:19.662 --> 39:21.595
eye on that. I told her I
thought that they pushed

39:21.597 --> 39:21.595
the envelope too much.

39:21.597 --> 39:25.499
Yeah. Pushed it right
into the devil's mailbox,

39:25.501 --> 39:27.668
if you ask me.

39:27.670 --> 39:29.903
Did I ever tell you about
these meetings I attend?

39:29.905 --> 39:32.639
What, like, like a meetings?

39:32.641 --> 39:35.776
No... No. It's, it's a
different kind of group.

39:35.778 --> 39:37.845
Um, in fact I was gonna ask you if we could

39:37.847 --> 39:40.748
hold our meeting at your barn, you know?

39:42.684 --> 39:44.084
Sure, yeah.

39:44.086 --> 39:45.953
You know, irregardless of whether or not

39:45.955 --> 39:48.956
you sign the deed over to me or not.

39:49.991 --> 39:51.592
Yeah, you see, we just want to keep a

39:51.594 --> 39:54.561
low profile. I'll tell you
all about it later. I just,

39:54.563 --> 39:57.464
you know, didn't want to overwhelm ya.

39:57.466 --> 39:58.732
Uh, but speaking of the deed, though,

39:58.734 --> 39:59.867
can I take a look?

39:59.869 --> 40:00.968
Right.

40:14.115 --> 40:16.917
It's gonna be fine, Seth.
And you and your Mom,

40:16.919 --> 40:18.185
you can be caretakers.

40:18.187 --> 40:21.455
Stay there as long as you need to.

40:22.590 --> 40:24.725
How is she doin'?

41:20.081 --> 41:22.749
Plant's looking healthy.

41:25.687 --> 41:29.690
Can you write something for me?

41:47.509 --> 41:51.578
Come with me.

41:54.616 --> 41:58.685
I think I can't really see you.

42:00.255 --> 42:04.124
In a computer, I can open it up, see

42:04.126 --> 42:08.128
every resistor, every
wire, every part in it.

42:08.130 --> 42:11.932
But I couldn't tell you about its behavior.

42:15.770 --> 42:19.640
You see, the hardware is simply
where the software resides.

42:19.642 --> 42:21.308
To understand the behavior,

42:21.310 --> 42:24.711
you have to understand the software.

42:24.713 --> 42:32.719
And the software has no mass.

42:32.721 --> 42:36.757
Jimmy, I can't stay here.

42:37.692 --> 42:41.762
Who's Seth?

42:50.805 --> 42:54.308
Let's get you something to eat.

42:54.310 --> 42:58.579
All right?

44:37.011 --> 44:38.111
How you doin'?

44:50.958 --> 44:52.426
Did you love Mom?

44:52.428 --> 44:56.263
Of course I did. Why would you say that?

45:05.873 --> 45:08.475
What's up?

45:10.344 --> 45:13.246
Seems like you spent
more time with her after

45:13.248 --> 45:15.849
she got sick than before.

45:15.851 --> 45:17.451
That's not true.

45:17.453 --> 45:22.456
I was there, Dad.

45:22.458 --> 45:28.095
We were trying to figure things out.
Just like you are, em.

45:28.097 --> 45:31.798
Can't underestimate this set back.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.468
Our minds have limits.

45:35.203 --> 45:39.272
They're fixed. We're fucked. Hers?

45:39.274 --> 45:44.478
She's advancing even
beyond our wildest dreams.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.279
Do you know how many lives we can

45:46.281 --> 45:47.481
save with that notion?

45:47.483 --> 45:50.450
This has exceeded every expectation.

45:50.452 --> 45:50.450
I was just under the impression

45:50.452 --> 45:54.387
that this was all gonna end at some point.

45:56.023 --> 45:57.891
I have to be honest with
you, as your friend.

45:57.893 --> 45:59.493
The board feels like you've forgotten

45:59.495 --> 46:04.765
your duties here. Your research.

46:07.835 --> 46:10.771
Singularity's objective

46:10.773 --> 46:15.842
G.N.R. Genetics,
nanotechnology, robotics.

46:15.844 --> 46:19.079
Humans have rationalized,
even made excuses for death.

46:19.081 --> 46:22.215
Somehow it's noble.

46:22.217 --> 46:24.184
But it is our job to term death

46:24.186 --> 46:26.887
as a tragedy. A tragedy of lost

46:26.889 --> 46:29.856
intelligence, of lost relationships.

46:29.858 --> 46:33.460
Therefore, it is our job
to extend life. Period.

46:33.462 --> 46:35.362
Oh just spare me the diatribe.

46:35.364 --> 46:41.134
It's yours, man. And I
think you need a reminder.

46:42.537 --> 46:46.807
We are on the precipice of
changing human evolution.

46:46.809 --> 46:49.543
We won't have to worry about death.

46:49.545 --> 46:51.444
We can swap out these suboptimal

46:51.446 --> 46:54.147
bodies and engineer ourselves to be gods.

46:54.149 --> 46:56.950
But don't you ever have a hint of doubt?

46:57.585 --> 47:00.420
Ever?

47:02.256 --> 47:05.025
Now clearly she's not the same em.

47:05.027 --> 47:07.828
But she is not my little girl, em.

47:07.830 --> 47:09.029
We make better humans.

47:11.365 --> 47:13.233
And she's the first step.

47:54.141 --> 47:57.477
Em!

48:30.344 --> 48:33.914
And look at that.

48:34.582 --> 48:38.151
You're just stronger.

48:40.021 --> 48:41.354
No.

51:59.286 --> 52:02.222
Times are tough.

52:02.224 --> 52:04.390
What's the matter, Russ?

52:04.392 --> 52:06.259
We either move to the
Mountainsor off the grid or we

52:06.261 --> 52:08.628
take that alternative stance.

52:08.630 --> 52:12.866
And when our stuff gets taken away...
Right, Renee?

52:12.868 --> 52:15.468
When our stuff gets taken away, that's when

52:15.470 --> 52:18.338
we're tested.

52:18.340 --> 52:21.541
I don't know, folks. I don't know. But this

52:21.543 --> 52:24.210
decision is not mine. I
am not the driving force

52:24.212 --> 52:27.413
here, okay? It's all of us.
We all are in this

52:27.415 --> 52:30.483
together, right?

53:45.693 --> 53:48.761
I thought it best that we come here.

53:53.300 --> 53:57.737
Look... Em, look, am I, um...

53:57.739 --> 54:00.907
Are we, are we in any trouble?

54:03.344 --> 54:05.979
I have your obituary at my house.

54:05.981 --> 54:12.986
At least I thought... I
thought, I thought I did.

54:12.988 --> 54:16.923
I was taken to my dad's...

54:19.994 --> 54:22.695
facility.

54:22.697 --> 54:25.798
Singularity.

54:25.800 --> 54:28.301
You know about it?

54:28.303 --> 54:32.005
There was some nurse or lady...
There was someone...

54:32.007 --> 54:34.807
She was at the hospital
when I went to go say my

54:34.809 --> 54:37.877
goodbyes. She said that
she worked for your Dad.

54:41.782 --> 54:44.917
She wasn't very informative, except...

54:45.853 --> 54:48.855
Yeah, this was it.

54:57.364 --> 55:00.967
It almost was.

55:02.903 --> 55:08.975
My Dad thought his lab was my only chance.

55:10.577 --> 55:13.646
And I, um...

55:14.948 --> 55:18.918
Two years feels like two weeks to me.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.520
There's been a lot of physical therapy

55:20.522 --> 55:23.623
and I'm starting to get my memory back.

55:25.559 --> 55:28.628
You just remember us now?

55:30.331 --> 55:32.632
Shit!

55:34.435 --> 55:36.369
I don't understand, like, why the...

55:36.371 --> 55:39.439
Why the funeral? Why...?

55:40.374 --> 55:43.943
What did they do to you?

56:01.095 --> 56:03.096
Seth. Seth.

56:31.024 --> 56:33.092
Shit.

56:48.509 --> 56:50.576
Come on.

57:51.773 --> 57:55.908
Yeah, he was pretty proud of that.

57:55.910 --> 57:55.908
You hungry?

57:55.910 --> 57:59.479
I'm sorry I made, I made
scrambled by default

57:59.481 --> 58:02.048
'cause they're less hard to screw up.

58:06.887 --> 58:08.754
Was the bed comfy?

58:08.756 --> 58:12.492
It was fine, thank you.

58:12.494 --> 58:15.495
I'm just gonna run these
out to my Mom real quick.

58:15.497 --> 58:18.664
I'll be right back.

58:30.612 --> 58:33.179
Alright Mom, it's time to eat.

58:35.983 --> 58:40.987
I'll be back to check on you, all right?

59:30.170 --> 59:31.237
Are you gonna eat?

59:31.239 --> 59:33.306
No.

59:51.925 --> 59:54.360
Why are you here?

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:05.638
I had nowhere else to go.

01:00:06.039 --> 01:00:08.741
You're confusing to me, em.

01:00:10.043 --> 01:00:12.778
I don't...

01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:20.219
I'm not... I'm not saying
that I don't want you here.

01:00:21.054 --> 01:00:24.657
It's just I feel like
half the time, ya ain't.

01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:28.661
If that makes sense.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:39.939
So is someone looking for you then?

01:00:40.874 --> 01:00:44.010
Listen, I... The whole thing about it,

01:00:44.012 --> 01:00:47.213
it's just got me paranoid.

01:00:51.752 --> 01:00:56.255
I don't know what to say, like
I'm part of this, this group.

01:00:56.257 --> 01:00:59.158
It's called the 144.

01:01:00.093 --> 01:01:02.361
It represents the forty-four
families in this community

01:01:02.363 --> 01:01:08.067
that lost their livelihood
to factory farming.

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:15.007
And the one is just, you
know, under one god,

01:01:15.009 --> 01:01:17.743
it's just a funky name that we gave it.

01:01:17.745 --> 01:01:24.183
Look, basically, these people
are a group of Luddites.

01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:26.385
I'm part of them. It's around the country.

01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:30.756
It's big. But we were talking about...
Remember when we

01:01:30.758 --> 01:01:32.825
talked about what your
Dad did for a living,

01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:35.361
like before your accident.
It's like even you said that

01:01:35.363 --> 01:01:39.031
he was into some pretty advanced stuff.

01:01:40.901 --> 01:01:43.135
Like how do we ...How
do we know that you're

01:01:43.137 --> 01:01:49.375
not some experiment to see how
far they can push technology?

01:01:49.377 --> 01:01:51.844
Em!

01:01:52.779 --> 01:01:54.180
Em! Wait!

01:01:54.182 --> 01:01:58.050
What? What am I to you,
the sum of my parts?

01:01:58.052 --> 01:01:58.050
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:58.052 --> 01:02:00.720
No? You think I wanted this?

01:02:00.722 --> 01:02:02.788
Okay, listen, I'm sorry! All right? I just,

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:06.492
I... I can't lose you again!

01:02:06.494 --> 01:02:08.461
Listen, you show up back in my life

01:02:08.463 --> 01:02:13.365
and everything just got so fucked.

01:02:13.367 --> 01:02:15.101
And I'm sorry I'm still trying to process

01:02:15.103 --> 01:02:18.170
this, but...

01:02:19.439 --> 01:02:24.777
I... I... I need you to stay.

01:02:24.779 --> 01:02:28.180
No, I want you to stay.

01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:29.849
Please don't leave.

01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:32.284
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened to you.

01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:34.220
No, I'm sorry.

01:02:34.222 --> 01:02:38.157
I'm... So sorry.

01:02:58.347 --> 01:02:59.246
Oh!

01:02:59.247 --> 01:03:01.947
Em! What the hell are you doing?

01:03:01.949 --> 01:03:02.848
Ohh.

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.517
- Come here.
- Ohh.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.288
Just keep your hand under there.

01:03:17.497 --> 01:03:19.565
Can I see your hand?

01:03:42.455 --> 01:03:45.057
Let us pray.

01:03:45.992 --> 01:03:53.098
Lord, be with us here tonight.
Allow your words to guide us

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.136
and give us the courage we need
to stand firm in our beliefs.

01:03:57.138 --> 01:04:00.339
Give us the strength, lord,
to face these troubling times

01:04:00.341 --> 01:04:06.512
head on. These things
we ask in Jesus' name.

01:04:07.447 --> 01:04:08.447
Amen.

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:10.916
Amen.

01:04:10.918 --> 01:04:13.953
Well where are we, folks?

01:04:13.955 --> 01:04:16.288
Where are we?

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.556
It's time to wake up.

01:04:17.558 --> 01:04:21.227
And figure out what's most important to us.

01:04:21.229 --> 01:04:23.896
And how this so-called progress

01:04:23.898 --> 01:04:25.598
is affectin' our lives.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.401
Not only our lives, but the
lives of our patriots.

01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:32.404
It's time we get off our ass.

01:04:33.006 --> 01:04:36.041
I apologize. Let's just
put this another way.

01:04:36.043 --> 01:04:40.112
- Jeremiah 1:17.
- Get yourself ready.

01:04:40.114 --> 01:04:43.315
Stand up and say to them
whatever I command you.

01:04:43.317 --> 01:04:47.353
Do not be terrified by them,
or I will terrify you

01:04:47.355 --> 01:04:50.289
before them.

01:04:51.892 --> 01:04:56.028
That's not me talkin' folks. That's god.

01:04:58.365 --> 01:05:00.966
Oh, wow.

01:05:00.968 --> 01:05:06.071
I didn't even know places
like this existed anymore.

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:10.476
It's paradise.

01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:17.283
My mom's doing so much better...
thanks to you.

01:05:17.285 --> 01:05:20.386
I don't know about that, but I'm glad.

01:05:20.388 --> 01:05:23.689
Thank you.

01:05:23.691 --> 01:05:28.594
Well, it's great being with you, so...
It's easy.

01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:33.999
Oh. I gotta get the picnic stuff.

01:05:34.001 --> 01:05:36.068
Okay.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.671
You're shaking.

01:06:12.673 --> 01:06:16.375
Yeah.

01:06:16.377 --> 01:06:19.445
Are you scared of me?

01:06:20.714 --> 01:06:24.583
No.

01:06:45.538 --> 01:06:47.606
Em?

01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.820
Seth?

01:08:14.627 --> 01:08:18.162
Now we need to act now,
or we don't act at all.

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:19.564
It's just a report.

01:08:19.567 --> 01:08:23.635
It doesn't mean that it's
the mark of the beast.

01:08:28.475 --> 01:08:31.609
So, how's this thing go?

01:08:31.612 --> 01:08:33.545
Is it this way or that way?

01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:36.381
Pvt. Huey Durmont my name is Huey Durmont.

01:08:36.383 --> 01:08:36.381
E-2

01:08:36.383 --> 01:08:40.252
e-2, no you have to, you
have to say what that is.

01:08:40.254 --> 01:08:41.886
Sorry.

01:08:41.889 --> 01:08:49.361
Private first class. Um, part
of the 47th chromosome project.

01:08:49.363 --> 01:08:52.397
I see.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:54.500
It's definitely one step closer to that,

01:08:54.502 --> 01:08:57.502
that jumpin' Jesus we've
all be talkin' about.

01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:59.805
You could say that about
every single moment

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.874
of every single day.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.408
Look, I'm not defending technology,

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:04.776
but you're wrong if you
think that I'm somehow

01:09:04.778 --> 01:09:07.578
undecided about this, because I'm not.

01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:09.281
But what are we, some terrorist group?

01:09:09.283 --> 01:09:14.520
I uh, had a Neuro chip implant.

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:22.294
I lost control of myself.

01:09:22.296 --> 01:09:24.863
Shot...

01:09:24.865 --> 01:09:33.572
My best friend during a
combat training regimen.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:37.643
Tattoos. For every man,
woman, and child. Required.

01:09:37.645 --> 01:09:41.846
Required! Forced through some
kind of mandatory enrollment.

01:09:41.849 --> 01:09:45.450
Now that is the very
definition of a mandate.

01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:47.452
Now, I don't know about you,
but that doesn't sound too

01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:47.452
innocent to me.

01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:50.756
I'm not claiming, I'm not
claiming that it's innocent.

01:09:50.758 --> 01:09:52.457
All right? What I'm saying is that

01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:56.929
maybe it'd be better to walk
away than engage in a war.

01:09:56.931 --> 01:10:00.199
What about the mountains, like you said?

01:10:02.936 --> 01:10:04.303
Go on.

01:10:04.305 --> 01:10:13.745
Uh, I now believe I was not controlling my

01:10:13.747 --> 01:10:19.585
thoughts, arms, or hands.

01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:28.260
I was a husband and a father.

01:10:28.262 --> 01:10:35.767
I don't have them anymore. I was
moved to a privately funded

01:10:35.769 --> 01:10:41.473
institution and...

01:10:41.475 --> 01:10:42.975
I can't do this.

01:10:45.912 --> 01:10:49.314
I can't do what you asked me.

01:10:49.316 --> 01:10:51.850
Uh, now how, how 'bout what,
what do you got there?

01:10:51.852 --> 01:10:51.850
What is that?

01:10:51.852 --> 01:11:03.028
Viruses can be manufactured and used
with the public none the wiser.

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:11.903
And the worst part is here... Here.

01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:14.573
Now hold it closer so we can see it.

01:11:14.575 --> 01:11:16.875
There ya go, yeah.

01:11:16.877 --> 01:11:25.684
Yeah, this is a capsule that was
detected by a spectrograph.

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:32.691
It's uh, it's broken so not to worry.
Uh, it

01:11:32.693 --> 01:11:40.399
could kill a lot of people
within a hundred-yard radius.

01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:43.969
Look, man, I love you. You know I do.

01:11:43.971 --> 01:11:46.038
Your Dad was good to me.

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:53.745
Can you tell us the name
of the private facility?

01:11:53.747 --> 01:11:56.648
Singularity.

01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.784
But I'm afraid your time
with this girl is clouding

01:11:58.786 --> 01:11:58.784
your judgement.

01:11:58.786 --> 01:12:01.787
That has absolutely
nothing to do with this.

01:12:01.789 --> 01:12:03.522
Yeah, well I know who she is.

01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:05.657
And I know you've been hiding her from us.

01:12:05.659 --> 01:12:09.728
Trying to keep us from
knowing the truth about her.

01:12:48.836 --> 01:12:53.105
Can I have a room? Please?

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.934
Daddy?

01:15:04.872 --> 01:15:07.939
It's an rfid chip.

01:15:07.941 --> 01:15:11.610
They were able to track this.

01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:17.249
So I just wanna make sure.

01:15:25.191 --> 01:15:28.527
If they were tracking me, why

01:15:28.529 --> 01:15:30.929
didn't they pick me up before now?

01:15:30.931 --> 01:15:34.099
I was able to convince them to hold off.

01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:37.135
See how you did out there.

01:15:37.137 --> 01:15:39.938
Out there?

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:43.875
The real world.

01:15:53.819 --> 01:15:57.055
Your mother wanted me to focus on you.

01:15:57.057 --> 01:15:59.124
And I didn't.

01:16:00.726 --> 01:16:02.827
I'm sorry.

01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:12.704
The truth is that you're so much like her.

01:16:12.706 --> 01:16:14.039
I was, anyway.

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:15.874
No, you, you are like her.

01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:18.310
You are very much like her.

01:16:18.312 --> 01:16:20.579
You still are.

01:16:32.258 --> 01:16:38.597
I blame myself for not
being able to save her.

01:16:38.599 --> 01:16:41.032
The... Technology wasn't there for me

01:16:41.034 --> 01:16:43.034
to do anything about it,
but I still blame myself.

01:16:47.974 --> 01:16:50.041
Because...

01:16:53.112 --> 01:16:58.650
My business is doing the impossible.

01:16:58.652 --> 01:17:02.354
Such bullshit.

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:05.256
She never wanted what I wanted.

01:17:05.258 --> 01:17:05.256
I know.

01:17:05.258 --> 01:17:10.228
She got so sick all she
really wanted was peace.

01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:16.635
And the only thing she felt really terrible

01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:22.207
about, was leaving you behind.

01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:27.846
How do you feel about Seth?

01:17:27.848 --> 01:17:30.015
Why?

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.952
I'm afraid he could be in danger.

01:17:33.954 --> 01:17:36.721
I'm afraid anyone that
comes in contact with you,

01:17:36.723 --> 01:17:40.091
they may see as a threat.

01:17:47.366 --> 01:17:49.200
I've got your passport in the back.

01:17:49.202 --> 01:17:53.071
Change of clothes. We're going to Canada.

01:17:55.241 --> 01:17:57.308
And Seth?

01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:01.012
Fuck.

01:18:19.732 --> 01:18:22.333
Thank you.

01:18:25.705 --> 01:18:28.106
Okay, you're close.

01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:31.342
Go get him.

01:18:31.344 --> 01:18:34.446
I gotta... Few things to take care of

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:37.215
and then I'll catch up with you, okay?

01:18:38.384 --> 01:18:41.453
You be safe.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:50.428
I love you.

01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:52.764
You get goin', okay?

01:18:52.766 --> 01:18:56.134
I love you too.

01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:41.012
May I help you?

01:19:41.014 --> 01:19:44.549
I'm looking for em.

01:19:44.551 --> 01:19:47.452
She ain't here.

01:19:47.454 --> 01:19:50.522
I'll come back then.

01:22:30.215 --> 01:22:33.351
Seth!

01:22:33.353 --> 01:22:36.387
Oh, god!

01:22:38.324 --> 01:22:40.391
No!

01:22:40.393 --> 01:22:43.461
Oh, baby.

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:47.065
Oh, shit!

01:22:47.067 --> 01:22:53.571
Of course you don't have
your phone... Right?

01:22:53.573 --> 01:22:55.273
It's okay, I'm gonna go get us help, okay?

01:22:55.275 --> 01:22:57.642
Okay.

01:22:57.644 --> 01:22:58.544
Let's go.

01:24:02.674 --> 01:24:04.709
What do you want, Hank?

01:24:05.644 --> 01:24:07.378
You know, I wanted to
give you an opportunity

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:07.378
to put all this in motion.

01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:12.650
I need good people out there
campaigning for the cause.

01:24:12.652 --> 01:24:16.654
You know, sort of integration.

01:24:17.089 --> 01:24:20.324
So I'll give you a chance to
repent for your sins, Roy.

01:24:20.326 --> 01:24:22.660
And you'd be a great
contribution on your part

01:24:22.662 --> 01:24:25.730
if you volunteered that.

01:24:26.532 --> 01:24:28.499
Are you too lost at this point?

01:24:28.501 --> 01:24:30.601
Lost?

01:24:30.603 --> 01:24:33.671
What's white is black and vice versa.

01:24:33.673 --> 01:24:35.740
Huh, Hank?

01:24:36.775 --> 01:24:39.277
What're you, gestapo now?

01:24:42.214 --> 01:24:45.283
You really think we don't
know what's going on?

01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:49.420
And you were right. Of course.

01:24:49.788 --> 01:24:51.789
Sending her out here by
herself was the best

01:24:51.791 --> 01:24:53.858
thing we could have done for her.

01:24:54.693 --> 01:24:57.762
You're a genius even
when you're not trying.

01:24:58.252 --> 01:24:59.331
It's a damn shame.

01:24:59.332 --> 01:25:02.600
What the hell are you talking about?

01:25:03.368 --> 01:25:08.106
We see everything, Roy.
So, you can tell us.

01:25:09.408 --> 01:25:10.741
Don't tell us. It doesn't matter.

01:25:10.743 --> 01:25:13.411
It's just a chance for redemption.

01:25:14.346 --> 01:25:16.380
You better not hurt her, Hank.

01:25:16.382 --> 01:25:18.783
Why would I hurt em? We just
want her back, that's all.

01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:18.783
We're partners!

01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:26.390
When did you ever treat me like a partner?

01:25:26.392 --> 01:25:30.294
Anyway, the board deems you unfit.

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:34.332
I'm just sad you lost your way.

01:25:34.334 --> 01:25:36.868
You know I gotta thank you.
It's a great testament to your

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:42.306
good work. She has exceeded all
known biological capabilities.

01:25:43.242 --> 01:25:43.241
It's a miracle, right?

01:25:43.243 --> 01:25:47.411
I used to agree with you.
A week ago, I might have

01:25:47.413 --> 01:25:51.549
agreed with you. But I've been wrong.

01:25:52.484 --> 01:25:56.587
We just can't change features
or a feature and not think that

01:25:56.589 --> 01:25:57.922
there's not going to be consequences.

01:25:57.924 --> 01:26:00.558
And we can't just arrogantly
think that we can

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.828
transcend thousands of
years of an experience.

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:05.730
Yeah, I don't know if there's a god.

01:26:05.732 --> 01:26:07.832
I don't. I'm a confused
and bitter man, Hank.

01:26:07.834 --> 01:26:09.767
But, I have to admit that I've been longing

01:26:09.769 --> 01:26:12.403
for something like nanotech or

01:26:12.405 --> 01:26:15.339
artificial intelligence to take
us to that next level, you know?

01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:20.244
To... To something beyond
that even I could articulate.

01:26:20.246 --> 01:26:22.480
I know you're just trying to buy time.

01:26:23.415 --> 01:26:26.484
We don't need you to find her.

01:26:32.357 --> 01:26:35.426
I just needed a way to get you to buy in.

01:26:35.928 --> 01:26:38.429
You understand?

01:26:40.933 --> 01:26:44.368
Thank you.

01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:45.369
Hank.

01:26:45.371 --> 01:26:46.671
You did a great job.

01:26:46.673 --> 01:26:49.540
Everybody at singularity thanks you.

01:26:49.542 --> 01:26:50.808
Hank.

01:26:54.646 --> 01:26:57.615
Listen, I'm not gonna
make it to the hospital.

01:26:57.617 --> 01:26:59.517
You gotta pull over, baby.

01:26:59.519 --> 01:27:00.551
Just pull over.

01:27:00.553 --> 01:27:02.620
Okay.

01:27:10.262 --> 01:27:12.697
Stay with me.

01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:14.932
Let me take you to the hospital.

01:27:14.934 --> 01:27:17.568
I know where I need to go, okay?

01:27:17.970 --> 01:27:21.839
No. Stay.

01:27:21.841 --> 01:27:23.908
I can't.

01:27:26.545 --> 01:27:27.545
Come on.

01:27:27.547 --> 01:27:31.349
We have to go, okay?

01:27:31.351 --> 01:27:33.417
Okay.

01:27:33.419 --> 01:27:34.986
Please.

01:27:34.988 --> 01:27:37.421
I'm here, wherever you want.
Wherever you want.

01:27:37.423 --> 01:27:38.522
Okay.

01:27:38.524 --> 01:27:40.391
Okay.

01:28:24.436 --> 01:28:26.437
Sweetie, we're here.

01:28:26.439 --> 01:28:28.072
We're here.

01:28:28.074 --> 01:28:30.675
Hey, we're here.

01:28:32.844 --> 01:28:35.446
It's paradise.
