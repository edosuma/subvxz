00:07.090 --> 00:08.550
Come here and help.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.427
-Are you okay?
-<i>Warning.</i>

00:10.510 --> 00:12.762
<i>Internal pressure loss</i>
<i>detected in landing module.</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:15.473
-Mr. Hwang, are you okay?
-<i>Oxygen levels unstable.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:16.558
<i>Warning…</i>

00:16.641 --> 00:19.227
Be careful. E1, check the equipment.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.647
-<i>Oxygen levels unstable.</i>
-He has internal injuries, so be careful.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.525
Can you breathe, Mr. Hwang?

00:25.608 --> 00:29.154
<i>Warning. Internal pressure loss</i>
<i>detected in landing module.</i>

00:29.237 --> 00:30.989
<i>Oxygen levels unstable.</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:34.075
-E2, check the equipment!
-Yes, sir!

00:35.618 --> 00:37.370
<i>Oxygen levels unstable.</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:03.146
Captain,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.857
all engines are inoperative right now.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.525
What's our location?

01:07.609 --> 01:10.945
We're 7.6km northwest of Balhae Station.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.535
And the fire detection system?

01:18.036 --> 01:20.038
I can't check on it.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.624
Fuck. Nothing in here fucking works.

01:22.707 --> 01:25.376
We're about to lose power too.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.963
Send out a distress signal,
and get ready to leave.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.675
Control, this is Lieutenant Ryu Taesuk
of Nuri 11. Do you copy?

01:34.177 --> 01:36.596
Control, do you copy?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.973
This is Nuri 11. Control!

01:40.683 --> 01:41.810
Control, do you copy?

01:42.811 --> 01:43.728
Control.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.231
This is Nuri 11. Control!

01:47.107 --> 01:48.441
Dr. Song.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.193
Dr. Song, are you all right?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.319
Yes.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.781
-Doc Hong, how is he?
<i>-</i>One second.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.493
He fractured his left ribs.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.499
All I can do right now

02:04.582 --> 02:06.251
is give him painkillers.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.710
Check if he can move.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.338
-Turn him over.
-E1, E2, check the weapons and equipment.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.339
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

02:11.422 --> 02:12.507
Can you move?

02:14.342 --> 02:15.301
One second.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.681
Communications are still down.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.100
The system is shutting down.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.275
The water is leaking.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.564
BALHAE LUNAR RESEARCH STATION

<i>According to</i>
<i>the National Institute of Statistics,</i>

04:54.544 --> 04:58.673
<i>infant mortality rate hit</i>
<i>an all-time high this year.</i>

04:58.756 --> 05:01.759
<i>Among the main causes mentioned are</i>
<i>various infections and diseases</i>

05:01.843 --> 05:04.762
<i>caused by the consumption</i>
<i>of contaminated water.</i>

05:05.388 --> 05:09.058
<i>Governmental and private enterprises</i>
<i>are vigorously making investments</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:12.103
<i>in mega vertical farms,</i>
<i>which can drastically reduce water usage.</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:16.649
<i>In the midst of this global food shortage</i>
<i>caused by water shortage,</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:18.776
<i>many anticipate the possibility</i>

05:18.860 --> 05:22.322
<i>of mega vertical farming</i>
<i>becoming the solution for this problem.</i>

05:22.405 --> 05:25.575
<i>Illegal pet-keeping is becoming</i>
<i>more and more serious by the day.</i>

05:25.658 --> 05:28.202
<i>The government is offering a fine waiver</i>

<i>and euthanasia support</i>
<i>during this amnesty period,</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:33.875
<i>but only a small minority</i>
<i>has utilized this program.</i>

05:33.958 --> 05:38.463
<i>Meanwhile, the Fair Water Distribution Act</i>
<i>was rejected yet again in the Assembly.</i>

05:38.546 --> 05:41.591
<i>The demand for the abolition</i>
<i>of the water supply regulation grows</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:43.718
<i>as the inequalities</i>
<i>in access to water deepens,</i>

05:43.801 --> 05:45.511
<i>but there seems to be no end in sight.</i>

05:45.595 --> 05:48.848
-Abolish the regulation!
-Abolish!

05:48.931 --> 05:50.475
Abolish the regulation!

05:50.558 --> 05:52.393
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

05:52.477 --> 05:54.270
Distribute water fairly!

05:54.354 --> 05:56.147
-For fairness!
-For fairness!

05:56.230 --> 05:57.607
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

05:57.690 --> 05:59.567
Abolish the regulation!

<i>Mr. Kim,</i>

06:57.166 --> 07:00.211
I heard your water grade
was upgraded to Class B.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.546
Congratulations.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.798
It's not a huge increase, though.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.009
The researchers here
probably have higher classes.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.010
I see.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.263
What's Dr. Song Jian like?

07:11.013 --> 07:12.181
She's a scientist.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.184
Smart, boring, conceited,
and condescending.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.354
So why do we need an ethologist
for this mission?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.731
She used to be a big-name astrobiologist.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.902
Then why did she quit
and go into ethology?

07:24.986 --> 07:27.655
No idea. I guess it paid better.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.075
Have you met her before?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.661
Five years ago. Just once.

07:35.496 --> 07:36.497
What's that?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.630
Mr. Kim, you got a new pair of glasses.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.757
You used to wear brown horn-rimmed ones.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.760
Yes, you have an amazing memory.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.720
That was five years ago.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.765
So what are you here for?

08:36.432 --> 08:40.645
Your papers on astrobiology
have recently been gaining more attention.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.230
Amazing work.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.067
Are you here because of the Mars Project?

08:47.693 --> 08:49.904
I'm no longer interested in astrobiology.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.739
I see, but…

08:52.323 --> 08:55.326
There's nothing in space.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.872
I came to visit you today

08:59.956 --> 09:03.543
because we need an astrobiologist
to take part in an important mission.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.754
Director Choi also
recommended you for the position.

09:06.837 --> 09:07.838
Director Choi did?

09:09.924 --> 09:11.759
What's the mission?

09:11.842 --> 09:15.304
I can only share details
after you accept our offer.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.644
Are there any scientists
who fall for what you just said?

09:24.105 --> 09:25.940
You might change your mind

09:26.440 --> 09:28.317
once you hear the destination.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.488
Where is it?

09:33.072 --> 09:34.323
Balhae Station.

-I hear you're going to Balhae Station.
-Who are you?

11:22.598 --> 11:24.016

11:28.854 --> 11:30.189
I've heard a lot about you.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.024
You got here early.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.069
Yes, I just wanted to come

11:36.487 --> 11:37.613
and see this.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.619
<i>This memorial is to remember…</i>

11:43.703 --> 11:47.248
Things still seem very gloomy here.

11:47.331 --> 11:51.544
<i>…five years ago at Balhae Station.</i>

11:52.962 --> 11:55.965
<i>Through independent efforts, the SAA was…</i>

11:56.048 --> 11:57.591
Why don't you reconsider?

12:00.636 --> 12:01.595
Reconsider what?

12:01.679 --> 12:03.097
Going to Balhae Station.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.558
You should reconsider.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.769
Captain!

12:08.853 --> 12:09.854
Salute!

12:11.689 --> 12:12.606
Hello.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.985
This always breaks my heart.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.904
They should've at least had
the names of the deceased engraved.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.199
Exactly. It's always the crew
that gets mistreated.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.326
Long time no see, sir.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.287
Hey, it's you. Ryu Taesuk.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.707
Oh, this is Lieutenant Ryu Taesuk!

12:29.790 --> 12:32.501
The famous elite soldier of the military.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.754
I have a good feeling about this mission.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.714
-Nice to meet you.
-Same.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.467
I'm Gong Soochan, sir. Salute!

12:39.550 --> 12:41.135
-Yes, hello.
-Nice to meet you.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.680
-I'm Top Gun of SAA, Kim Sun.
-Yes, nice to meet you.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.309
What?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.436
How does he call himself the Top Gun?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.439
You little rascal.
He never even served in the army.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.942
Okay, then. He got dumped last week
because he's so ugly.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.487
-It's not because I'm ugly.
-Then what?

12:59.570 --> 13:03.365
Hello, I'm Eun Jiyoung,
appointed as the co-pilot of this mission.

13:04.074 --> 13:04.909
I see.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.327
Nice to meet you.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.580
I'm Kim Heesun, the Top Gun of SAA.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.874
Yes, I know who you are, sir.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.167
How do you know who I am?

13:15.377 --> 13:18.172
Wow, I'm really looking forward
to this mission.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.806
Whoa, the golden card.

13:27.932 --> 13:28.766
Wow.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.812
I've never seen one in person before.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.648
I see.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.483
You must be nervous.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.277
It's like that at first.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.655
But you'll get used to it soon enough.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.449
When you're in outer space,

13:45.533 --> 13:48.202
one day together feels like
a year spent together on Earth.

13:50.079 --> 13:55.584
So in my opinion, the looks
of the crew members are very important.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.545
Think about it.

13:57.628 --> 14:02.716
You're stuck in a tiny spacecraft
staring at the same faces every day.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.053
Without eye candy to look at,
it gets pretty tough.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.058
Oh, I'm the team doctor for this mission,
Hong Gayoung.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.519
Just call me Doc Hong.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.356
-Nice to meet you, I'm--
-I know, Dr. Song Jian.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.608
Well. You're very famous.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.734
Can I speak casually?

14:20.818 --> 14:21.694
No.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.737
I see.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.656
I guess you prefer to keep a distance.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.368
How should I address you, then?
Dr. Song? Ms. Jian?

14:34.331 --> 14:35.708
I like Dr. Song better.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.335
You're a gold member,
so Dr. Song suits you better.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.715
The higher-ups are here. Hello.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.719
It's been a while, Dr. Song.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.475
Balhae Station was temporarily closed
for five years after the radiation leak.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.352
We decided to close it permanently.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.731
Your mission is
to retrieve an important sample

14:58.814 --> 15:03.068
before the permanent closure
of the station and return to Earth.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.030
Once you land on the Moon,
your allotted mission time

15:06.530 --> 15:07.781
will be 24 hours.

15:12.953 --> 15:16.790
The sample you are to retrieve
is in this capsule you see right here.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.085
This capsule was designed
to maintain a very low temperature

15:20.169 --> 15:22.504
to protect its contents.

15:22.588 --> 15:26.342
If the capsule is in good condition,
you won't have a problem in the retrieval.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.761
However, if you find
even the smallest defect

15:28.844 --> 15:31.013
on the outer shell
or in its thermoregulator,

15:31.096 --> 15:32.681
you must pay particular attention.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.976
Yes, Dr. Song?

15:37.394 --> 15:41.023
What specifically is this substance
we're to retrieve?

15:41.106 --> 15:43.943
Why does it have to be transported
under very low temperatures?

15:46.236 --> 15:47.112
Well…

15:47.988 --> 15:51.408
The information was lost in the accident,
so we do not know for sure.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.785
Please continue.

15:54.828 --> 15:58.958
There are a total of three locations
where we believe the samples are left.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.628
The station was in extreme disorder
at the time of the accident,

16:02.711 --> 16:06.006
so we do not know to what degree
these samples have been damaged.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.927
There is no need to retrieve
a large amount of the samples.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.512
Our main focus

16:11.595 --> 16:13.973
is on the safe retrieval
of at least one sample.

16:14.473 --> 16:19.561
Aw, you're asking for too much.
We deserve to know more than that.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.731
We aren't a delivery service
who just travels to pick up parcels.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.609
It's like any other mission.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.320
We just have to do as we're told.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.993
The SAA was also given
very minimal information,

16:34.493 --> 16:36.829
so please understand the lack of details.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.707
If we do not know
what this dangerous substance is,

16:39.790 --> 16:42.084
how are we going to retrieve it <i>safely?</i>

16:42.876 --> 16:45.629
I wonder, do you really want
this mission to be a success?

16:47.589 --> 16:50.259
That's why we need you, Dr. Song.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.719
Dr. Song.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.723
It seems like you believe

16:55.806 --> 16:58.892
we're hiding some crucial information.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.939
But sadly, we also don't know anything.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.234
That's why we needed

17:07.317 --> 17:11.363
a talented astrobiologist like you
in this troubling situation.

17:11.947 --> 17:12.865
Or…

17:14.116 --> 17:16.326
did I get it wrong?

17:18.954 --> 17:21.081
Captain Han is in charge of the operation,

17:21.874 --> 17:24.126
but your decision will be prioritized

17:24.626 --> 17:26.712
when it comes to the sample.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.257
Please bear that in mind.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.601
5 YEARS AGO

17:40.684 --> 17:44.021
You'll never have to worry
about water again.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.607
Rather than government compensation,

17:46.690 --> 17:49.318
please consider this
your sister's last present.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.911
Go away.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.900
Captain Han.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.321
Are all your missions conducted like this?

19:17.281 --> 19:20.576
It makes no sense to restrict
necessary information for the mission.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.497
Are you always that passionate?

19:25.581 --> 19:28.834
There's less than 10% probability
our whole crew will survive.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.669
If you're worried about their safety,

19:30.752 --> 19:33.338
you should reduce the uncertainty
as much as you can.

19:33.422 --> 19:37.009
Uncertainty lies everywhere,
be it outer space or Earth.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.721
So I shouldn't ask any questions
and just do as I'm told?

19:42.639 --> 19:44.183
The outlook is quite bleak.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.439
Aren't scientists people who find a way

19:50.522 --> 19:51.940
in such situations?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.322
Are you sure you still want to come?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.325
Now that you mentioned my work ethic,

20:01.909 --> 20:02.868
I can't back out.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.667
I will ask for your opinion
when I deem it necessary.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.062
Aw…

20:31.939 --> 20:33.523
Why did you bring so much stuff?

20:33.607 --> 20:35.901
Did you bring your entire lab here?

20:35.984 --> 20:36.944
It's just that

20:37.903 --> 20:39.821
I didn't know what I might need.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.209
Wow, look at everyone hard at work.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.044
Reporting for duty.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.879
I'm Lee Gisu, the co-pilot.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.800
Nice to meet you.
I look forward to working with you.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.599
I've never seen him before.
Why was she switched out?

21:09.810 --> 21:12.020
I can't believe how they treat us.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.481
We have a little something
called teamwork.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.858
We aren't replaceable mechanical parts.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.237
They can't just bring a new co-pilot
right before takeoff.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.614
It's five minutes to docking.
Should I dismiss him?

21:22.698 --> 21:25.826
No, I'll make a great team with him.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.331
PULL TO OPERATE

21:34.960 --> 21:36.545
You seem really nervous.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.046
Relax.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.179
Nothing like sweets to help you relax.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.309
What are you doing?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.311
Mind your own business.

21:53.061 --> 21:56.982
Okay? Mr. Nosy,
if you fail to land this thing smoothly,

21:57.065 --> 21:59.693
I'm going to throw up
on the back of your head.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.002
Have we met?

22:17.085 --> 22:17.961
No.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.922
You seem familiar.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.093
Well, I have an ordinary face.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.386
Nice to meet you.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.151
Oh, Dr. Song.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.280
I heard EHSRC gives you
a good grade for water access.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.948
What's yours? B?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.410
No way, is it higher? Class A?

22:50.494 --> 22:52.245
Why do you care if she's a B or C?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.790
Why are you so curious?

22:54.873 --> 22:57.751
We'll all get promoted
to Class A after this mission.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.088
Come on, we're as good as family now.

23:01.671 --> 23:05.133
I was just being friendly.
You're always too harsh on me, Doc.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.301
It feels like

23:06.927 --> 23:09.137
you're all going on a trip or something.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.973
We're all just pretending.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.560
What else can we do?
We're already on board.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.777
All crew members, put your helmets on.

23:26.863 --> 23:30.075
<i>Nuri 11. One minute to docking.</i>

23:31.618 --> 23:33.412
Preparing to dock.

24:00.522 --> 24:06.278
<i>Countdown begins. Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

24:06.361 --> 24:11.241
<i>main engine, ignited,</i>
<i>five, four, three, two,</i>

24:11.324 --> 24:13.869
<i>vernier engine, ignited. Liftoff.</i>

24:42.647 --> 24:44.691
<i>Control, this is Nuri 11.</i>

24:44.774 --> 24:47.402
<i>We have entered the orbit as scheduled.</i>

24:49.821 --> 24:53.366
<i>Nuri 11 is in orbit as scheduled.</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:57.537
<i>I now have control.</i>
<i>Switching to autonomous navigation system.</i>

24:57.621 --> 24:58.580
<i>Copy that.</i>

25:04.711 --> 25:10.967
<i>Autonomous navigation confirmed.</i>
<i>Flight orbit and speed, optimal.</i>

25:19.476 --> 25:21.269
When will we be in the Moon's orbit?

25:23.563 --> 25:25.565
It's scheduled for 9:06 a.m.

25:25.649 --> 25:29.110
We will not be able to reach Control
for two hours due to a meteorite shower.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.072
Ask for the revised data when we're back.
Keep an eye out.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.073
Yes, sir.

25:45.502 --> 25:49.673
Mr. Hwang made a big contribution
during the construction of Balhae Station.

25:49.756 --> 25:53.885
He also stayed there for a long time
as a part of the research team.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.471
He decided to cooperate with us

25:56.555 --> 25:58.348
as an advisor for this mission.

26:01.518 --> 26:07.023
But don't you think Mr. Hwang
is almost a little too quiet?

26:07.566 --> 26:10.068
Has anybody heard him talk? I haven't.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.444
Is that just who he is?

26:11.528 --> 26:14.531
Yes, he definitely talks
much less than you do.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.868
He's the only one here
who has been to Balhae Station.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.246
I have millions of questions for him.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.373
What really happened there?

26:23.456 --> 26:26.459
I'm dying to know. Should I ask? I will.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.086
Hey, Soochan.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.254
Don't.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.380
In my opinion,

26:31.715 --> 26:36.052
both Mr. Hwang and Director Choi
don't really know anything in particular.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.930
I can hear you.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.183
If I can hear you, anybody can, right?

27:30.732 --> 27:36.529
<i>Anomaly detected in spacecraft exterior.</i>

27:36.613 --> 27:39.699
-What's the problem?
-The system is… One second.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.077
It's the docking system.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.163
The locking bolt won't last
if we get into the landing orbit.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.623
Ah, fuck.

27:47.624 --> 27:50.460
If the locking bolt falls off,
it'll hit the engine.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.296
We can't reach SAA Control.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.924
It'll take 20 minutes to reach them again.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.093
-The bolt is shaking harder.
-Fuck.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.761
How long until we land?

27:59.844 --> 28:02.681
We'll enter the landing orbit
in seven minutes.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.265
It's going to come off.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.310
Release the module.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.728
-Sorry?
-What?

28:08.812 --> 28:11.064
If we do, the point of entry changes.

28:11.147 --> 28:13.733
We'll save the landing module
before it's too late.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.903
Release the module.
We have to land no matter what.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.366
All crew members, check your seatbelts!

28:21.449 --> 28:23.535
Prepare yourselves for impact!

28:32.794 --> 28:37.132
<i>Switching to module release mode.</i>

28:37.215 --> 28:38.341
Releasing the module.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.058
<i>Ignite main engine!</i>

28:48.643 --> 28:51.438
<i>Fuck! The main engine won't ignite!</i>

28:57.986 --> 28:59.738
Prepare for thrust control.

29:03.616 --> 29:04.617
Three!

29:05.994 --> 29:07.078
Two!

29:07.662 --> 29:08.747
One!

29:08.830 --> 29:11.082
Igniting the thrust control engine!

29:19.299 --> 29:22.135
At this rate, we're going to crash!

29:26.264 --> 29:27.515
Straighten the fuselage!

29:27.599 --> 29:30.059
Please work! Please!

29:33.062 --> 29:34.439
Brace for impact.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.450
-Fuck!
-We're crashing!

30:06.971 --> 30:09.015
<i>The spacecraft is tipping.</i>
<i>We have to escape.</i>

30:11.476 --> 30:12.519
Let's go.

30:31.746 --> 30:32.789
Step aside.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.959
Watch out!

31:26.092 --> 31:27.135
Is everyone okay?

31:35.935 --> 31:37.270
Hang on tight!

31:40.607 --> 31:41.524
Dr. Song!

31:48.531 --> 31:50.158
Dr. Song, hang on!

31:52.243 --> 31:53.494
Captain!

32:59.811 --> 33:02.063
The satellite communication system
has been destroyed.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.648
We can't communicate with the SAA.

33:04.774 --> 33:08.361
They probably saw everything
back on Earth.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.156
Mr. Hwang, it'll be tough
for you to breathe

33:12.240 --> 33:14.450
because your fractured rib
is pushing down on your lung.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.660
You have to stay strong.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.829
Yes, I'm all right.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.017
Step aside.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.985
How far are we from Balhae Station?

33:49.944 --> 33:51.738
We're about 7.6km away.

34:37.658 --> 34:38.993
I just got the chills.

34:40.036 --> 34:40.912
Me too.

34:41.412 --> 34:44.916
Does that mean we're astronauts
without a spacecraft now?

34:44.999 --> 34:46.084
What do we do now?

34:46.167 --> 34:48.795
What do you think?
Wait until the rescue ship gets here.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.514
Let's head to Balhae Station.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.682
Let's go.

35:23.579 --> 35:27.583
Captain, do you think we could
complete the mission in 24 hours now?

35:27.667 --> 35:29.127
Forget about the mission.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.214
Do we even have enough oxygen
to get to the station?

35:33.297 --> 35:34.757
I'm so anxious.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.344
You'll definitely get there
if you shut your mouth.

35:39.178 --> 35:42.390
Once we get there, we'll contact Earth
to rearrange our mission.

36:24.765 --> 36:25.850
Mr. Hwang.

36:30.062 --> 36:31.439
Are you all right, Mr. Hwang?

36:35.568 --> 36:38.863
Dr. Song, don't wait for us. Keep going.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.749
Dr. Song, you have to keep moving.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.052
Get moving.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.891
Can you keep walking?

37:07.516 --> 37:09.227
-Can you?
-Yes, I can.

38:06.492 --> 38:07.535
Is that

38:08.786 --> 38:10.037
Balhae Station?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.790
It looks much bigger than we expected.

38:17.211 --> 38:18.254
We have to hurry.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.716
We'll run out of oxygen at this rate.

38:26.345 --> 38:30.433
The southern region has a bit of slope,
but we could get to the station faster.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.730
Captain.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.777
Are you sure Mr. Hwang can make it?

38:41.861 --> 38:44.572
Mr. Hwang, hang in there.
We're almost there.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.052
His blood pressure keeps dropping.

39:06.135 --> 39:08.596
It seems the bone fragments
punctured his lungs.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.514
We have to get to the station quickly.

39:14.894 --> 39:15.770
Water.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.315
What did you say?

39:24.236 --> 39:25.154
Water.

39:25.654 --> 39:26.530
Water?

39:33.662 --> 39:34.497
Water.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.582
He's out of water.

39:38.292 --> 39:39.335
Bring some water.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.637
Here you go, sir.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.443
Mr. Hwang.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.079
The water…

40:19.625 --> 40:21.377
Don't…

41:14.054 --> 41:15.055
Captain.

41:25.065 --> 41:27.318
We'll take him with us when we return.

41:28.861 --> 41:29.904
Yes, sir.

41:43.667 --> 41:44.585
