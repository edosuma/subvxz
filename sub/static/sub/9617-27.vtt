00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:10.611 --> 00:12.144
Hey! A dollar!

00:12.146 --> 00:14.179
They're finally paying us
to come here.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.182
Dopes. I'd come here
for nothing.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.951
You know why? I have to.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.386
Stupid law.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.222
Wait, everybody has one.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.958
So, what do you got there?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.894
It's a trap. Everybody just
give your dollars to me,

00:28.896 --> 00:30.996
And I'll hold them
is what I'll do.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.398
Yeah.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.999
The united states
government says that

00:34.001 --> 00:35.901
These pieces of paper
are worth something.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.403
What makes them valuable?

00:37.405 --> 00:38.871
Farkle, do it.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.672
Paper money used to be
certificates that

00:40.674 --> 00:43.142
You could exchange
for their equal value
in gold or silver.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.177
Before that, people would
buy things with livestock,

00:45.179 --> 00:46.845
Colored stones,
or shiny objects.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.213
I like shiny objects.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.517
Which one of these
shirts is better?

00:51.519 --> 00:54.653
Same size, same color,
same shirt.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.423
One of these comes from cheapo's
and costs $12.99,

00:57.425 --> 01:00.492
The other one comes from
demolition and costs 36 bucks.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.428
So, which one's
the better shirt?

01:02.430 --> 01:05.297
-Riley?
-Watch my little fashionista go.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.068
The bleh shirt on the left,
though appearing

01:09.070 --> 01:11.403
To the untrained eye
to look the same...

01:11.405 --> 01:14.339
-It's the same shirt.
-...Is not from demolition,
making it inferior.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.808
Same shirt.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.877
I will take
the demolition bleh.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.013
(chuckles)
you already did.

01:21.015 --> 01:24.249
This is your shirt.
You spent 36 washingtons on it.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.385
It costs more,
so it's better.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.337
(chuckles)

01:28.338 --> 01:30.288
Same exact shirt from
the same exact manufacturer

01:30.291 --> 01:31.790
That sends it to
a million different stores

01:31.792 --> 01:32.858
All over the world.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.961
Mine's better.
It feels good on my face.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.529
This is your shirt.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.298
I changed the labels
this morning.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.400
(quivers)

01:41.402 --> 01:43.368
This shirt hurts my face!

01:43.370 --> 01:45.471
Give me that one.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.706
Mm. I know my shirt anywhere.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.780
That's my demolition
shirt, isn't it?

01:54.782 --> 01:57.483
Why would I change the labels
when I can just talk?

01:57.485 --> 02:00.285
Obviously you people
will believe anything.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.155
Mr. Matthews,
are you teaching us that
money has no real value?

02:03.157 --> 02:06.592
I'm teaching you that money is
paper we put our faith in.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.460
Wars are fought over it.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.096
Most crime happens
because money's involved.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.397
I'm safe.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.502
I'm teaching you that
the value given to money

02:16.504 --> 02:19.505
Is a lot less important
than how it's used.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.973
That's what matters.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.808
That's what shapes who you are.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.245
Don't be mislead
by trendy brands
and shiny objects.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.946
So, what should we do
with our money?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.114
Buy food.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.116
-Have shelter.
-Do charity.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.284
(gasps)

02:32.286 --> 02:33.952
Riles, you gave me
the demolition one.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.320
Mm-hmm.
Charity with a full heart.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.256
Also, I made a mistake.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.591
What about doing business?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.593
My father is the minkus
of minkus international.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.495
Yeah, he's been in the news
a lot recently.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.465
I hear he's risking
a lot of his company
on a new technology.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.966
It's something
he really believes in,

02:47.968 --> 02:49.501
But he doesn't know
if it's gonna work yet.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.702
When will he find out?

02:50.704 --> 02:53.005
Not sure. When he does
this kind of stuff, he's...

02:53.007 --> 02:54.673
Not around the house very much.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.943
Farkle, how come you never
have us over to your house?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.546
-I've already told you.
-No, you say you're embarrassed

03:00.548 --> 03:02.347
By it, but how big
could it possibly be?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.516
I don't know.
I haven't seen it all.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.385
Farkle, we couldn't
love you less

03:06.387 --> 03:08.353
Just because you have
more than us.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.888
Not anymore.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.392
-Minkus.
-Hi, cory.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.562
Is it okay if I speak to farkle
about a minor issue?

03:16.564 --> 03:17.963
(cries one cry)

03:19.833 --> 03:21.567
Uh, minkus,
is this one of those

03:21.569 --> 03:23.068
Where we go out
in the hall and talk?

03:23.070 --> 03:24.369
Yeah.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.645
You know, it's--
it's interesting.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.215
I was just teaching the class
about the value of money

03:36.217 --> 03:38.584
And how we place
too much value
on shiny things.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.718
That's good...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.386
'cause, son...

03:41.388 --> 03:43.522
I've lost all
of our shiny things.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.556

Okay, I was able to find

04:43.083 --> 04:45.484
$24 in all of my piggy banks
and drawers.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.119
I sold a couple
of baseball bats online.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.654
I got $58 to kick in.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.888
Thank you, lucas.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.456
All right, so...

04:51.458 --> 04:55.327
Between the two of us,
we can give farkle $82.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.162
Maya?

04:57.164 --> 04:59.931
Between the three of us,
we can give farkle $82.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.433
Good job, guys!

05:01.435 --> 05:03.669
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, farkle.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.504
We wanted to
give you something.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.905
$82.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.674
Thanks, but I think it's maya
who can help me out best.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.576
-How?
-I want you to give me lessons
on how to be poor.

05:11.578 --> 05:12.844
Done. $82 a lesson.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.181
Lesson one complete.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.819
You have less than we do, maya,
but you live a really good life.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.854
You don't just survive
in this world. You thrive.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.423
That's what I've always
loved about you.

05:24.425 --> 05:25.590
Thanks, farkle.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.859
Not much to tell you except...

05:27.861 --> 05:29.194
You see these clothes I wear?

05:29.196 --> 05:31.363
-Yeah?
-Shawn bought them for me,

05:31.365 --> 05:33.532
And I take care of them
and I appreciate them.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.802
I don't have much, but I try
to appreciate what I do have.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.538
That's really good advice, maya.
I mean, I have so much.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.772
I don't really appreciate
any of it.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.107
Now, it's gonna be gone.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.709
Well...

05:43.711 --> 05:45.677
Let's go to your house
while you still have it.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.611
My house?

05:46.613 --> 05:49.381
Yeah. Farkle, you've been
to our houses.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.449
We haven't been to yours.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.650
I don't think
that's a good idea.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.452
Farkle, we get it.
You were rich.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.953
You have a nice room.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.455
Well, I just want to hang out
with you guys at your places.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.490
-Why?
-I don't know.
I like your places.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.524
We're going.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.026
Your room can't change
how we feel about you.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.701
(rhythmic thumping)

06:11.038 --> 06:12.371
Why is your mouth open?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.705
Maya's hitting me.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.575
-Maya.
-Look at this stuff!

06:16.577 --> 06:18.543
(thumping continues)

06:18.545 --> 06:20.645
-How can you not hit him?
-You have to stop!

06:20.647 --> 06:23.415
What are you gonna do
about it, little... Rich boy?

06:23.417 --> 06:25.584
-(train toots)
-what is that? A train?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.386
I'm gonna send you far,
far away.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.391
-(train toots)
-you have boarded the "c" train

06:32.393 --> 06:34.426
For the kitchen,
the skating rink,

06:34.428 --> 06:37.562
And the minkus megaplex 17.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.068
Farkle, how do you
possibly live here?

06:43.070 --> 06:45.704
Look down there.
The people are ants.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.906
Look up there.
I just saw a comet fly by.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.575
Yeah. My ceiling is
a planetarium.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.211
But don't worry, riley.
Pluto will always be
a planet in my room.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.213
Aw. Good.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.682
You're the same farkle
no matter how much
money you have.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.918
Yeah, I don't think money could
change any of us.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.486
(train toots)

07:06.794 --> 07:08.960
What? I stopped
at the gift shop.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.107
Something I can
help you with, aug?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.776
Do you have any idea when
the mother of the house
will be getting home?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.578
What do you need, auggie?

07:26.580 --> 07:27.712
Today's allowance day.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.448
Mommy usually gives it to me.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.917
Oh, okay.
Well, here you go.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.985
N-- no. I'll just wait for mom.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.721
I don't get it.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.457
What, her money is better
than my money?

07:38.459 --> 07:39.491
No.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.826
I just know that
mommy makes more,

07:40.828 --> 07:43.462
And I don't want to
put a dent in you.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.996
(chuckles)
well, that's true.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.766
She does, but I think I can
handle your allowance, auggie.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.402
What do you get there?
One, two bucks?

07:51.738 --> 07:52.804
Okay, I get two bucks.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.841
Oh, what? You-- you--
you-- you get three?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.644
All right, this is gonna hurt
my argument here.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.446
It didn't have to come to this!

08:01.448 --> 08:02.981
Uh-- well-- well,
do-- do you need

08:02.983 --> 08:04.649
To mail a letter?
Here-- here's a stamp.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.686
This makes me feel bad.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.657
-Hi. How's your day going--
-quick! I-- I need a buck!

08:12.659 --> 08:13.892
C-- can you break a 20?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.762
This makes me feel bad!

08:20.801 --> 08:21.867
What?

08:25.372 --> 08:28.540
Well, me and this cat would
look wonderful strolling

08:28.542 --> 08:29.841
Down the <i> champs-elysees.</i>

08:29.843 --> 08:32.177
Being poor lesson number two:

08:32.179 --> 08:34.312
We will never stroll
down the <i> champs-elysees.</i>

08:34.314 --> 08:35.881
Paris.

08:35.883 --> 08:36.948
Enjoy.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.855
Oh, that's got some distance!

08:44.992 --> 08:46.625
I don't get boys.

08:46.627 --> 08:50.061
Farkle, what is this game?
<i>Zombies eat your brains four?</i>

08:50.063 --> 08:52.531
Do you really play this?
I'm ashamed of you.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.832
Yeah? Try it.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.534
Stop it. What-- what,
this old thing?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.969
-(accordion music playing)
-no, I just got this
out of the closet.

08:57.971 --> 09:01.239
No, jean pierre l'fontaine.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.942
As fun as this is...

09:06.179 --> 09:07.746
-It's not real.
-(music stops)

09:08.815 --> 09:10.982
Lesson number three
on being poor:

09:10.984 --> 09:13.752
Way too easy to get caught up
in what's not real.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.520
You got a great,
big room, farkle.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.588
It just...

09:16.590 --> 09:18.657
Keeps us too far apart
from each other.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.226
-(zombies growling)
-die, suckers! Die!

09:21.228 --> 09:22.928
That's lesson
number four, right?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.563
It's better to be together.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.931
Always.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.098
Hey, guys.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.833
Great to see you
enjoying our house.

09:28.835 --> 09:29.901
Why haven't you ever been here?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.736
Oh, hi, minkus.
Nice crib.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.039
-Die!
-(zombies scream)

09:34.041 --> 09:37.676
Very sorry, you know,
for the unfortunate
turn of events.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.345
Thanks. I've always felt that
it's not the event that

09:40.347 --> 09:42.247
Reveals the man,
but how the man responds

09:42.249 --> 09:44.583
To the event that reveals
the true nature of character.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.051
How are you responding, sir?

09:46.053 --> 09:47.586
I watch cartoons.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.088
I eat cereal without milk
because my tears fill the bowl.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.790
Stuff like that.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.959
I want you to know I don't care
if we live like this or not.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.261
Why not, farkle?
Aren't you proud
of what we've done?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.763
I'm not really sure
of what we've done, dad.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.799
I know if the stock market
goes up, you're happy,

10:00.801 --> 10:02.233
And if it goes down,
you're not.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.769
I know the busier you are,
the less I get to see you,

10:04.771 --> 10:06.938
And if you're wondering
why I've never brought
my friends here before,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.773
It's because
I'm a little embarrassed.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.644
-By me?
-No. Never by you.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.980
By all this stuff we have.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.948
We have so much.
Why do we deserve it?

10:25.058 --> 10:26.558
What do you think?

10:28.228 --> 10:30.261
I think you're
the best there is.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.964
Look at us.
We're having a really good time.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.666
I like this little ferret.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.900
Hi.

10:35.902 --> 10:39.270
Hey, what are you doin'?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.806
There's people
right out your window.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.341
I wish I had that.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.276
Where are they all going?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.845
Right now?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.446
They're going home, farkle.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.181
Do you know them?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.683
What about her?
Do you know her?

10:51.685 --> 10:54.019
Yeah, that's mrs. Abruzzo.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.254
Why is she wearing two jackets?

10:56.256 --> 10:57.856
I always ask her that.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.092
She said she just doesn't have
time to get a warmer coat,

11:01.094 --> 11:03.294
But she says she's fine.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.630
I don't think she's fine.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.998
Yeah.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.634
Hi, mrs. Abruzzo.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.536
You have a great room, maya,

11:11.538 --> 11:13.104
With a much better
view than mine.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.707
I'm glad you
appreciate it, farkle.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.310
-Hi, guys.
-(giggles)

11:19.312 --> 11:21.212
My room is an idiot.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.948
It has everything
in it except for
the most important thing.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.183
Lucas: Us?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.985
How can you put
a price on that?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.720
You don't.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.855
You can't put a price
on what's truly valuable.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.859
Who needs money at all?
Lesson five, right?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.728
Wrong. When you don't have it,

11:36.730 --> 11:38.329
You learn when
it comes in handy.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.965
I mean, I'd fix
the leak in my roof,

11:40.967 --> 11:43.234
Do something about
the cracks in the plaster,

11:43.236 --> 11:44.669
Definitely patch up the hole

11:44.671 --> 11:46.905
That ginger came in through
a year ago.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.139
Wait a minute. What?

11:48.141 --> 11:50.408
Your cat that's a ferret
is a rat?

11:50.410 --> 11:53.278
Oh... There you go.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.318
This is the world.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.887
You see this piece of pie?

12:02.889 --> 12:06.091
These are the people
in the world who have pie,

12:06.093 --> 12:08.326
And this is everyone else
in the world who lives

12:08.328 --> 12:10.328
On less than $2 a day.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.396
Oh, my gosh.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.499
These are the people
in the world who have

12:14.501 --> 12:15.934
Access to
immediate medical care

12:15.936 --> 12:18.103
And do not live
in abject poverty.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.073
(cory colors)

12:24.077 --> 12:25.710
This is us.

12:25.712 --> 12:28.847
These are the people who get to
wake up in their warm beds

12:28.849 --> 12:30.682
And they get to eat
waffles in the morning.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.786
This is us. This is them.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.121
Look at me.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.056
Pay attention to this.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.858
Now, I've tried
to teach you guys that

12:39.860 --> 12:41.392
The secret of life is
people change people.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.027
Well, today, we're gonna
get more specific.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.131
This is us.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.099
This is them.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.268
What's the secret of life?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.705
Anybody?

12:55.041 --> 12:57.142
What us does for them.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.777
Kindness.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.112
Charity.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.048
That's what changes people.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.751
That's the secret of life.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.153
And thank you.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.622
I'm an "us"?

13:10.624 --> 13:11.756
You're an "us."

13:11.758 --> 13:13.958
You're blessed.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.727
We're all blessed.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.962
I'm sorry I've ever complained.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.199
I'll never complain
about my leaky roof again.

13:22.769 --> 13:23.835
Riley?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.939
What us does for them.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.641
The secret of life.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.845
Your assignment today
is to think about what good

13:33.847 --> 13:36.181
You guys would do
if you had money.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.649
Who would you help?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.490
I am...

13:46.927 --> 13:48.026
Humiliated.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.271
Farkle, I got your message.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.673
What are you doing?

14:01.675 --> 14:02.974
What are you doing?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.309
Do you have a good reason
for walking out

14:04.311 --> 14:05.343
In the middle of the day?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.045
Are we gonna
lose all our money?

14:07.047 --> 14:09.214
Are we not gonna be
minkus international anymore?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.715
Oh.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.687
I thought you didn't
care about this.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.455
I do now.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.192
The technology I bet on
was so sophisticated

14:21.194 --> 14:23.194
That we couldn't even
see it was successful.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.363
I bet on the right thing.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.831
Someday, you will inherit

14:26.833 --> 14:29.033
One of the world's most
successful companies.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.835
I think we should
give away our money.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.271
You are never
getting this company.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.841
What good is any of this?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.143
-What?
-What good do we do?

14:39.145 --> 14:41.212
We support many fine causes.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.381
-Not enough.
-How do you know?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.683
Because I have my own train,

14:45.685 --> 14:47.385
And you have
your own helicopter,

14:47.387 --> 14:48.987
And we don't see each other.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.091
You called me,
and I came home.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.860
I respect how
successful you are,

14:55.862 --> 14:58.529
But the world is full
of people, dad.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.099
None of them may be
as successful as you,

15:01.101 --> 15:02.600
But they go home.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.936
They go home every day.

15:04.938 --> 15:08.339
What good is what we have
if what we have keeps us apart?

15:10.777 --> 15:11.976
Come here.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.791
What is going on here?

15:26.793 --> 15:28.293
Don't know.
Need more info.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.360
(mouths)

15:33.266 --> 15:35.500
Uh, nope.
No help at all.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.102
'splain yourself.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.704
I'm sorry I made you feel bad.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.205
I'm trying to make it up to you.

15:41.207 --> 15:44.142
With a toy and carrots?

15:44.144 --> 15:45.310
What do you want from me?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.378
I didn't get
my whole allowance.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.280
Wait, how did he make
you feel bad?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.115
I don't know.
Everybody does.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.252
I know a terrible secret.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.787
'splain yourself.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.257
You make more money than daddy

15:59.259 --> 16:00.858
And I threw it in his face!

16:02.429 --> 16:05.296
I hurt my father,
and I don't want anything bad

16:05.298 --> 16:08.266
To ever happen to us
because of $3!

16:08.268 --> 16:10.134
Auggie...

16:10.136 --> 16:12.570
Do you think that
just because somebody makes

16:12.572 --> 16:15.440
More money than someone else
that makes them more valuable?

16:15.442 --> 16:16.507
Yes.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.644
Auggie, you didn't hurt
my feelings.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.113
Mom deserves
the salary she makes.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.183
Auggie, your daddy is
a great teacher.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.819
His contribution is
at least as much as mine.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.120
Why?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.789
Because without teachers,
we wouldn't have lawyers

16:31.791 --> 16:34.158
Or doctors or anyone, really.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.961
Then why doesn't he make
as much money as you?

16:36.963 --> 16:40.465
Well, because sometimes
the world makes mistakes.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.201
Aug, mom didn't become
a lawyer for the money.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.036
She did it to help people.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.705
We're both lucky that we have
jobs that let us do that.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.842
It's what you do,
not what you're paid.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.210
That's your value.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.711
Do you understand?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.716
Mr. Matthews, I had a talk
with my father today

16:58.718 --> 17:00.551
Because of what you taught us.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.153
Yeah, we didn't know
how lucky we are.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.788
We've been talking
about it all day.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.358
Thanks for my dollar, but...

17:07.360 --> 17:09.460
It's yours
and I'm giving it back.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.397
Thanks.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.798
Aug...

17:13.800 --> 17:16.501
Here's the rest
of your allowance.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.236
What are you gonna
do with it?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.380
Dad.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.215
I called you this time.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.551
I thought about what you said.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.220
I'm no success at all
if I haven't succeeded with you.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.856
-You have.
-You're right, farkle.
I should do more.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.825
We should probably
leave you two alone.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.294
No. Actually, this
involves all of you.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.864
This morning, I did something
I should have done long ago.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.167
I started the minkus
family foundation.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.435
We're gonna give
some money away,

17:50.437 --> 17:52.103
A lot of money,
to those who need it.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.172
And we want you all
to be a part of it.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.339
Well, what do we do?

17:55.341 --> 17:57.442
You're gonna help decide
who needs it.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.577
You've all been thinking
about the less fortunate.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.246
Well, we want the results
of your assignment right now.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.681
I knew you'd come up
with something.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.216
Well, I didn't come up
with it alone.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.918
I called a buddy of mine
who's pretty good

18:06.920 --> 18:08.719
At spotting the potential
in an idea.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.588
He's inside.
He's gonna help us
pick out the best one.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.333
That's mark cuban.
He owns the dallas mavericks.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.471
Mr. Cuban, I know that
you don't take the knicks

18:26.473 --> 18:29.073
Very seriously right now,
but just you wait.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.675
Yeah, I don't have
that kind of time.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.519
-You ready?
-Okay, guys. Impress me.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.295
Good afternoon, judges.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.735
Thank you for the opportunity
to do something wonderful.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.438
I have done some research,
and I found out that each year,

19:00.440 --> 19:02.440
America spends more money
on Halloween than

19:02.442 --> 19:04.742
The entire world spends
to end malaria.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.177
What do you want to do?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.513
I want to change Halloween
to malaria day.

19:10.416 --> 19:13.017
I want to get everybody to give
all of their candy money

19:13.019 --> 19:14.919
To help the world
wipe out malaria.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.687
This is your daughter?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.022
I don't know,
how'd she do?

19:18.024 --> 19:20.258
-Not good.
-I don't know her.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.160
What was wrong with it?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.861
People buy candy because
they want to give it

19:23.863 --> 19:25.463
To little kids
that come to their door.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.597
It's not about buying candy.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.367
It's about smiley, happy kids.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.436
I have two amazing, smiley,
happy kids right here.

19:32.438 --> 19:36.374
You are not taking Halloween
away from them.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.842
But malaria.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.976
But hunger.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.045
But poverty.
But sickness.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.514
Yeah, I want to get rid
of them all, but you gotta

19:43.516 --> 19:45.716
Give me an idea that works.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.418
(sadly)
but malaria.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.322
No getting rid of Halloween.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.541
I'm out.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.759
-(angrily) go, knicks.
-Yeah, we'll see how
that works for you.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.398
Tough room.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.902
-World peace.
-Great idea, miss america.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.238
-Thank you.
-I'm out.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.673
Well, what's the matter
with world peace?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.541
Nothing. I'm all for it.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.376
-You can't do it.
-And why not?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.045
Gandhi couldn't do it.
Are you gandhi?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.880
No, I'm miss america.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.415
Mr. Cuban hurt my feelings.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.418
-Lucas, I think maybe
mr. Cuban was just--
-what is this? Nice?

20:20.420 --> 20:21.519
-No, no--
-I'm out!

20:21.521 --> 20:22.553
-No, I was just--
-I'm out!

20:22.555 --> 20:23.654
-Topanga!
-I like him.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.989
-Minkus!
-Cuban!

20:24.991 --> 20:26.424
-Minkus!
-Thanks for coming out, buddy.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.725
Oh, you know it, buddy.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.660
I'm a sweetheart. Next.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.032
-Maya hart.
-What's that?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.934
She's a person I believe in.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.903
She never had very much
of anything.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.572
Maybe that's why she looks
at everything the right way.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.174
I'd give maya hart
a lot of money

20:43.176 --> 20:45.243
And trust her to do
whatever she wants with it,

20:45.245 --> 20:47.445
Because one day she will be
a force to reckon with.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.447
I think you should invest
in her right now.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.249
Maya hart!

20:51.251 --> 20:54.619
I didn't do it, and--
and these two were
with me the whole time.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.356
These two.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.593
We were thinking about
giving you guys a lot of money.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.129
Maya hart.
How you doin', cuban?

21:06.466 --> 21:07.632
So, you guys are gonna

21:07.634 --> 21:09.767
Create world peace
and cure diseases together?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.469
I'm gonna dream with them. Yeah.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.438
I always have.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.906
They're the ones
who taught me how.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.575
Just sometimes, I know better.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.809
What do you know?

21:18.811 --> 21:21.312
I know my roof leaks...

21:21.314 --> 21:23.748
And I know there is
a hole in my wall.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.449
What are you gonna do about it?

21:26.486 --> 21:28.452
I'm gonna get
an education from him,

21:28.454 --> 21:30.321
And I'm gonna
earn my own money,

21:30.323 --> 21:32.123
And someday I'm gonna have
a good place

21:32.125 --> 21:33.991
With good walls
and a good roof.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.327
And what are you gonna do
for everybody else?

21:36.329 --> 21:39.430
Everybody's a lot of people.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.265
But if I could afford it,

21:41.267 --> 21:43.467
I would fix
somebody else's roof.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.569
What about world peace
and disease?

21:45.571 --> 21:47.638
I'mma leave that to you guys

21:47.640 --> 21:49.473
Until I become
one of you guys.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.676
I don't invest
in just ideas.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.745
I invest in people
behind the ideas.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.781
Your roof leaks for a reason.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.417
You have these friends
for a reason...

21:59.419 --> 22:00.751
And they have you.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.520
Use them.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.388
I'm gonna give you some money,

22:04.390 --> 22:06.023
But you can't just keep it.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.859
I've learned that
when all you do is keep it,

22:08.861 --> 22:10.861
Maybe you don't
deserve to keep it.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.498
I'll do good with it.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.000
I promise.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.537
Can she keep a little of it
to fix her roof?

22:19.539 --> 22:22.406
See? You have these friends
for a reason.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.847
Thanks for showing me
you don't need money
to be rich, maya.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.016
Yeah, you do.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.651
And this is creepy.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.587
It is definitely cozier, farkle.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.156
Hey, lucas...

22:39.158 --> 22:40.925
(riley strums)

22:43.563 --> 22:46.697
♪ zombies ♪

22:46.699 --> 22:52.069
♪ I'm sorry for
treating you so bad ♪

22:54.307 --> 22:55.706
It's very confident.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.909
What are you guys looking at?

22:58.911 --> 23:00.544
It's a live-stream.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.912
Maya: Hey...

23:01.914 --> 23:04.915
Those are my people.
How'd you get my people?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.918
When we fixed your roof,
we put a camera on it
and a little speaker.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.253
Why?

23:09.255 --> 23:10.588
Because I wanted to say hi.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.390
Hi, mrs. Abruzzo.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.893
Nice coat.
