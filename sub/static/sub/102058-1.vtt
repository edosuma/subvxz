00:15.715 --> 00:18.435
May 2020 and
the coronavirus infections

00:18.467 --> 00:20.739
have now spread rapidly
throughout the UK

00:20.772 --> 00:22.884
with no vaccine in sight just
yet.

00:29.187 --> 00:31.875
People are being told to stay
indoors,

00:31.907 --> 00:35.268
only to leave for
essentials, food and drink,

00:35.300 --> 00:37.858
or one hour's daily exercise.

01:41.475 --> 01:44.259
Anyone who is seen with
members of another household

01:44.292 --> 01:47.842
will find themselves with a
heavy penalty.

02:56.035 --> 02:59.204
Finally people have to
change with the new normal.

02:59.235 --> 03:02.244
We will have to change
the way we do things,

03:02.275 --> 03:07.426
needed to insure that.

03:08.708 --> 03:11.202
What do you wanna do today?

03:46.467 --> 03:48.771
It's not the same is it?

04:07.875 --> 04:09.092
Hey, ladies.

04:10.308 --> 04:11.364
Hey, girls.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.179
Hey.

04:14.211 --> 04:16.772
So how are you all finding
lockdown?

04:16.803 --> 04:19.939
I feel like it's been so
long since we last caught up.

04:19.971 --> 04:21.346
Tell me about it.

04:21.378 --> 04:23.652
I'm going bored out of my mind.

04:23.684 --> 04:26.628
Must've faked tanned even
more than usual.

04:26.659 --> 04:27.780
I'm just trying to say it's all

04:27.811 --> 04:31.235
we're supposed to be in Hawaii
right now getting married.

04:31.268 --> 04:33.092
Oh, honey.

04:33.123 --> 04:34.882
How's Liam doing?

04:34.916 --> 04:36.706
He's still stuck abroad for
work.

04:36.738 --> 04:37.731
He tried to get a flight back

04:37.762 --> 04:40.035
but the borders are still
closed for coronavirus.

04:40.964 --> 04:42.115
I guess I must've deluded myself

04:42.147 --> 04:44.100
into thinking this would
all be over by now.

04:44.131 --> 04:48.291
But here I am. Not married
and cooped up in my house.

04:48.323 --> 04:51.010
It's weird not being
in a routine, isn't it?

04:51.747 --> 04:53.156
I keep getting into autopilot.

04:53.187 --> 04:54.978
Like this morning I got
up to make my coffee

04:55.011 --> 04:57.475
and thinking I was going into
the office.

04:57.507 --> 04:58.690
Oh my God. Me too.

04:59.811 --> 05:02.115
I've done that so many times.

05:02.148 --> 05:05.155
Oh I miss our morning chats in
the office.

05:05.187 --> 05:06.402
Oh, I do too.

05:07.204 --> 05:08.803
Yeah, I think it's gonna be a
while

05:08.835 --> 05:11.715
before we get back there.

05:11.748 --> 05:13.572
You know what I'm finding
the hardest though.

05:13.603 --> 05:15.619
Like not having human contact.

05:16.675 --> 05:18.595
Preach. Same.

05:18.627 --> 05:20.195
I miss my man.

05:20.228 --> 05:23.268
Well, Kelly, I
actually meant

05:23.299 --> 05:26.115
not having any kind of human
contact.

05:26.148 --> 05:27.012
But yeah.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.627
I just feel weirdly frustrated

05:30.659 --> 05:32.452
like I just wanna sit down

05:32.483 --> 05:35.459
and have a face-to-face
conversation with someone, you know.

05:36.323 --> 05:39.203
Mm-hm. This helps though.

05:39.236 --> 05:40.483
We should do this more often

05:40.515 --> 05:43.139
especially 'cause we're
all in the same situation.

05:43.172 --> 05:46.883
Locked down, alone.

05:47.587 --> 05:50.244
Girls, can I tell you something
that's been on my mind?

05:51.555 --> 05:52.995
I'm really worried about money

05:53.699 --> 05:55.523
because I haven't been working
at the office for very long

05:55.556 --> 05:56.547
and they said that they can't
pay me

05:56.579 --> 05:58.532
what I usually earn.

05:58.563 --> 06:00.452
Have you spoken to Barbra from
account?

06:00.483 --> 06:02.403
Yeah, and she said that
the best they could do

06:02.435 --> 06:06.212
is 80% which won't even cover my
bills.

06:06.243 --> 06:07.043
I've been trying to think of
things

06:07.076 --> 06:09.923
that I could do from home but
what?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.307
So I think the money
situation's taken its toll

06:14.339 --> 06:15.364
on everyone, babe.

06:15.395 --> 06:17.988
Even the insurance wouldn't
even cover my wedding.

06:18.019 --> 06:19.523
What do you mean?

06:19.556 --> 06:20.675
They wouldn't cover it.

06:20.708 --> 06:23.331
Said it was unforeseen
circumstances.

06:23.363 --> 06:24.515
So we lost all the money.

06:24.548 --> 06:25.827
Start from scratch now.

06:27.171 --> 06:28.675
Oh my God, stop.

06:28.707 --> 06:29.635
How can they do that?

06:29.667 --> 06:32.163
I would've thought the
insurance would kick in.

06:32.195 --> 06:35.012
Like, surely the only reason
they wouldn't cover it

06:35.043 --> 06:38.948
is if you changed your mind
or something.

06:38.979 --> 06:40.707
Nope. We lost it
all.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.467
I noticed that it was

06:42.499 --> 06:44.483
one of their small print
exceptions so...

06:47.011 --> 06:51.523
Okay, okay, while we're going
all in with confessions,

06:51.555 --> 06:53.219
can I tell you girls something

06:53.252 --> 06:55.235
and you promise you won't judge
me?

06:55.267 --> 06:57.092
After all the stories you've
told us,

06:57.123 --> 06:59.203
have we ever judged you?

06:59.235 --> 07:00.067
Come on.

07:00.099 --> 07:01.059
Spill.

07:02.371 --> 07:04.035
All right, okay, this
is gonna sound crazy

07:04.068 --> 07:07.139
'cause I was meant to be
getting married this week.

07:07.171 --> 07:08.835
I don't know, maybe
it's last minute nerves

07:08.868 --> 07:11.939
or something like that, but...

07:11.971 --> 07:16.483
I've been thinking a lot about
my ex-boyfriend recently.

07:16.515 --> 07:18.116
Like in lockdown.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.323
But before this, I very rarely
thought about him at all

07:20.355 --> 07:22.499
like I might check his
social media now and then

07:22.531 --> 07:25.892
but nothing like this.

07:25.923 --> 07:29.059
Like, thinking of him how?

07:29.091 --> 07:31.652
Yeah like sexually or...

07:32.739 --> 07:33.603
Both.

07:34.403 --> 07:36.675
Like what it would be like to be
with him

07:36.708 --> 07:39.236
and then yeah,

07:39.267 --> 07:41.539
sometimes, when I'm alone

07:41.571 --> 07:45.348
and things start getting
a bit heated in my mind,

07:45.379 --> 07:46.243
he pops up.

07:47.203 --> 07:48.995
Is he the one you climax to?

07:50.148 --> 07:53.443
Ness!

07:53.475 --> 07:54.883
I'm serious.

07:54.915 --> 07:56.547
Yeah.

07:56.579 --> 07:57.667
Is that really bad?

07:59.459 --> 08:01.379
No, I don't think so.

08:02.147 --> 08:05.571
I think it's just your
mind's got a lot of time

08:05.603 --> 08:09.379
and, you know, people are just
flickin' into it, that's all.

08:09.411 --> 08:11.972
I've some exes spinning
around in my head.

08:12.003 --> 08:14.691
But it's usually when
I can't sleep at night.

08:16.068 --> 08:17.923
Yeah, you're alone in
that big house, Kelly.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.323
I mean, I just think it's
normal.

08:20.355 --> 08:22.723
We've all got weird
thoughts going on right now.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.347
Go on.

08:29.379 --> 08:31.523
But you can't just leave
us hanging like that.

08:31.555 --> 08:35.043
Go on, what's been flitting
around in your dirty mind?

08:35.075 --> 08:38.722
Well...

08:38.756 --> 08:41.155
Before lockdown, Steven and I

08:41.187 --> 08:43.556
started watching some stuff
together.

08:43.587 --> 08:46.275
And it would be a crime
if you didn't tell us what.

08:47.715 --> 08:51.492
Well, we were watching
some raunchier videos.

08:51.523 --> 08:56.483
Unusual, that had like group
and rough, things like that.

08:57.219 --> 08:59.971
I would not have thought
you'd be into group.

09:01.283 --> 09:02.851
You'd be surprised.

09:02.883 --> 09:05.059
We dabbled in a threesome back
in the day.

09:06.147 --> 09:07.715
It's a long time ago now.

09:07.747 --> 09:09.859
It's really only just been us
since,

09:09.891 --> 09:13.443
but I don't know, recently, I
just...

09:13.475 --> 09:14.563
I've been wondering

09:14.595 --> 09:17.283
if maybe he might be into
some other stuff like that.

09:17.315 --> 09:18.563
I don't know.

09:18.595 --> 09:20.419
It's just hard to talk about
really.

09:22.147 --> 09:24.067
Well, now's the perfect time.

09:24.099 --> 09:25.219
Isn't he away?

09:26.371 --> 09:28.676
Yeah. He's staying with his
mum.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.867
I mean, it's understandable
in her condition.

09:32.899 --> 09:34.371
There's no way I was spending
lockdown

09:34.403 --> 09:36.323
with Steven's mum though.

09:36.356 --> 09:37.283
But yeah, he's gotta be

09:37.316 --> 09:38.435
there for her.

09:39.651 --> 09:42.019
Well, use this distance then.

09:42.051 --> 09:43.363
I always think it's so much
easier

09:43.395 --> 09:45.987
to talk via text about dirty
stuff.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.907
You know, you can text
him what you're thinking,

09:47.939 --> 09:49.315
see how you both feel.

09:49.347 --> 09:52.483
You can explore your limits
so much easier that way.

09:52.515 --> 09:53.667
Yeah, use this time.

09:53.699 --> 09:55.683
Yeah, maybe I will.

10:42.435 --> 10:43.107
Here we go.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.395
Well, that's it really.

10:47.427 --> 10:48.227
But as soon as I can,

10:48.259 --> 10:50.403
I only wanna head straight back
to you.

10:51.812 --> 10:54.115
I want my hands all over you.

10:56.227 --> 10:57.091
Is that right?

10:58.883 --> 11:00.707
This must be the longest time

11:00.739 --> 11:04.643
we haven't... you know.

11:06.019 --> 11:07.683
You can just say it, you know.

11:07.715 --> 11:08.835
We're not kids anymore.

11:10.723 --> 11:13.795
I want to rip that robe off
you.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.211
Listen.

11:26.243 --> 11:28.867
I need to tell you something
that's been on my mind.

11:30.531 --> 11:32.100
What's up?

11:32.132 --> 11:34.851
I mean, I have to be
completely honest with you

11:34.883 --> 11:37.091
'cause without that
what do we have, right?

11:38.179 --> 11:40.163
Sure. You can tell me
whatever.

11:42.692 --> 11:43.555
Okay.

11:45.795 --> 11:48.163
So I'm not really sure
what's been going on

11:48.195 --> 11:49.923
in my head recently but...

11:51.300 --> 11:54.627
I have Ricky on my mind a lot
recently.

11:57.539 --> 11:58.915
Your ex.

11:59.908 --> 12:01.028
Yeah.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.619
Oh you... what do you mean,
you have him in your head

12:03.651 --> 12:04.483
a lot lately?

12:04.515 --> 12:06.019
I don't know like...

12:07.075 --> 12:08.899
Like when I can't sleep
sometimes,

12:08.931 --> 12:10.467
sometimes he'll pop into my
mind.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.187
Do you miss him?

12:13.219 --> 12:14.755
No.

12:14.787 --> 12:16.739
No, I don't think I miss him.

12:16.771 --> 12:17.731
I love you.

12:18.851 --> 12:19.747
You haven't messaged him.

12:19.779 --> 12:21.891
No. God no, of course not.

12:24.771 --> 12:26.243
Sounds...

12:28.419 --> 12:29.283
very strange.

12:30.915 --> 12:33.827
I don't know how I feel about
this.

12:33.858 --> 12:34.723
I just think this has been

12:34.755 --> 12:36.771
really hard for me emotionally,
you know,

12:36.803 --> 12:40.196
and I think it's really
easy for your mind to wander

12:40.227 --> 12:41.699
when there's not something
specific

12:41.731 --> 12:42.883
that you're thinking about.

12:42.915 --> 12:44.707
You know what I mean?

12:45.603 --> 12:46.883
Right.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.355
You don't get it.

12:48.387 --> 12:50.595
Well, not usually, no.

12:50.627 --> 12:52.483
I do just feel like you
could be a bit more supportive

12:52.515 --> 12:54.947
with the difficulties that I'm
facing.

12:54.978 --> 12:56.259
Yeah, we're all facing
difficulties, Kelly,

12:56.291 --> 12:57.347
not just you.

13:22.883 --> 13:25.571
It would be quite hot if
you did mesh with some guy.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.483
I thought you said you
didn't like the idea.

13:32.515 --> 13:36.611
It was weird earlier, but
now when I'm horny, it's hot.

13:38.563 --> 13:42.467
Maybe not with him, your
ex, but some random.

13:44.995 --> 13:47.843
I like the idea of another man
inside you.

13:48.867 --> 13:50.914
Is that right?

13:50.947 --> 13:54.723
I like the idea of another
man's hands all over your body.

13:56.611 --> 13:58.916
What turns you on about it?

14:00.227 --> 14:03.587
Some random guy, coming in,

14:05.155 --> 14:09.059
taking my fiance, using her.

14:11.971 --> 14:12.931
Yeah, that's hot.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.771
Type of guy would you like?

14:18.498 --> 14:20.611
I like a guy in uniform.

14:21.603 --> 14:24.419
Would you like that then?

14:24.451 --> 14:26.563
Some other guy to use you?

14:28.676 --> 14:30.531
Like a threesome?

14:30.564 --> 14:34.179
I could be there but
I wouldn't wanna join.

14:36.034 --> 14:37.316
I would want to watch you.

14:38.340 --> 14:39.587
That's hot.

14:42.691 --> 14:45.347
It makes me rock hard.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.276
I'm touching myself at the
idea.

14:58.308 --> 15:00.642
Want you to picture another
guy

15:00.675 --> 15:02.244
in between your legs.

15:03.587 --> 15:05.923
I am.

15:05.956 --> 15:07.395
I want you to climax at the
idea

15:07.427 --> 15:09.507
of another man inside you.

16:20.900 --> 16:21.732
Mm.

17:25.124 --> 17:28.227
Here we go.

17:53.028 --> 17:53.892
Wow!

17:55.171 --> 17:57.251
Honey, you look...

17:58.915 --> 18:00.579
You don't like it?

18:00.612 --> 18:03.107
No, hell no, I do, I do.

18:03.138 --> 18:04.002
It's...

18:04.771 --> 18:05.955
That's good.

18:08.035 --> 18:09.795
That's good.

18:09.826 --> 18:12.132
It's just, my mother's in the
next room

18:12.164 --> 18:13.924
and she could

18:15.778 --> 18:16.835
come in at any moment.

18:18.755 --> 18:20.451
What's all this for?

18:21.442 --> 18:24.418
Well, I was thinking

18:24.451 --> 18:26.307
as I haven't seen you in a
while,

18:28.580 --> 18:31.971
I've had some thoughts in my
mind

18:32.002 --> 18:33.731
during this time that we've had.

18:34.978 --> 18:36.835
And I thought that maybe...

18:41.602 --> 18:42.402
Steven?

18:43.940 --> 18:45.378
Can you hear me?

18:46.788 --> 18:47.907
You're frozen.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.171
This old thing.

18:52.707 --> 18:53.571
Steven?

18:56.866 --> 18:58.978
Steven, can you hear me?

19:00.706 --> 19:02.340
You're frozen.

19:02.371 --> 19:03.204
Can you hear me? Can you hear
me?

19:05.155 --> 19:06.147
Fuck sake.

19:09.378 --> 19:10.338
You're frozen.

19:12.226 --> 19:13.091
Steven.

19:16.259 --> 19:19.042
Typical.

19:27.555 --> 19:28.227
Okay.

19:38.851 --> 19:41.315
Lots of things.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.219
Hey, Chanel.

23:45.252 --> 23:46.916
Hey, talk of the devil.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.867
We never expected you to be
coming.

23:48.899 --> 23:51.843
I just like the idea of being
watched.

23:52.803 --> 23:54.051
Hm, okay.

23:54.083 --> 23:55.491
So what do you wanna know?

23:56.643 --> 23:58.467
What can you teach
me?

24:00.803 --> 24:01.635
Outfits.

24:01.668 --> 24:03.747
It's all about the outfits.

25:29.636 --> 25:32.772
I earn nearly 1,500 a month.

25:32.803 --> 25:33.955
And now just after a year,

25:33.987 --> 25:38.435
I'm earning like
4000, sometimes more a month.

25:39.299 --> 25:41.635
I just work from home, I
choose my working hours,

25:41.667 --> 25:44.259
I can film whatever I want, and
whenever,

25:44.292 --> 25:47.075
my body, my choice.

25:47.107 --> 25:48.259
And when you first start out

25:48.291 --> 25:52.195
it's all about content, content,
content.

25:52.227 --> 25:54.467
I started with a lot of live
shows,

25:54.499 --> 25:57.732
but making your viewers
feel it's personal,

25:57.763 --> 25:59.491
you know, the interaction,

25:59.523 --> 26:02.499
they're getting with this girl
of their dreams.

26:02.532 --> 26:05.412
They wanna feel the human
interaction.

26:06.147 --> 26:09.155
And so if you can find
the time to reply to them

26:09.187 --> 26:11.747
in your DMs, or you know,
just go out of your way

26:11.779 --> 26:14.052
to even send a video message to
him.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.939
It will keep them hooked.

26:15.972 --> 26:17.027
And you'll find yourself

26:17.059 --> 26:19.843
with a true, loyal fan base.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.492
The master
and the submissive.

26:52.259 --> 26:56.131
A fun game that a lot of
you secretly think about,

26:56.163 --> 26:59.299
a brilliant way of keeping
your love life alive.

27:00.419 --> 27:03.139
How do you go about your first
steps?

27:03.171 --> 27:06.755
Well, this video will introduce
you

27:06.787 --> 27:09.027
to the beginnings of a master.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.163
Do you want to be a master?

27:12.195 --> 27:14.723
You have to find, in a safe way,

27:14.755 --> 27:17.187
what your limits are and theirs.

27:18.947 --> 27:21.219
Even when someone says
they have no limits,

27:21.251 --> 27:23.299
there should always be a safe
word.

27:24.387 --> 27:28.003
And as a master, it is your
mission

27:28.035 --> 27:30.659
to get to them to say that word.

27:32.547 --> 27:35.651
If I tell you something,
will you promise not to judge?

27:35.683 --> 27:36.451
After what I've told you

27:36.483 --> 27:38.467
what I'm doing with Steven, come
on.

27:40.643 --> 27:43.491
I think I've found a
quick way to earn some cash.

27:44.548 --> 27:45.411
Go on.

27:46.468 --> 27:49.315
Have you ever heard of
camming?

27:49.348 --> 27:50.243
Jenna, are you sure that's
something

27:50.275 --> 27:51.779
you wanna dabble in?

27:51.811 --> 27:54.115
Once you've got content
online, it can get out.

27:55.619 --> 27:57.347
Yeah, but it can't
come directly back to me

27:57.379 --> 27:58.915
if I change my name though,
right?

27:59.908 --> 28:01.731
Well, this is juicy.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.555
What would you change your name
to?

28:04.515 --> 28:07.395
Belle, Belle Summers.

28:07.427 --> 28:09.219
And not to sound patronizing,

28:09.251 --> 28:10.947
you have thought this through?

28:10.979 --> 28:12.195
You feel that this is what you
wanna do

28:12.227 --> 28:13.698
to earn some extra money?

28:15.651 --> 28:19.043
Yeah. Well, I've always liked
the idea of being watched.

28:19.076 --> 28:21.378
Why not mix it with work?

28:21.411 --> 28:23.363
Work and pleasure. My girl.

28:24.227 --> 28:24.867
Sign me up.

28:26.499 --> 28:29.923
Seriously though, I find it
hot the idea of guys seeing me

28:29.955 --> 28:32.195
but I'm still in control.

28:32.227 --> 28:34.723
It's kind of like what you're
doing, Ness.

28:34.755 --> 28:37.763
Sort of. Although
that's with my husband.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.140
- I do like the idea of it.
- Okay.

28:43.172 --> 28:45.443
Plus I really need the cash.

28:45.475 --> 28:48.739
Girls, I need your honest
opinions.

28:48.771 --> 28:51.075
I say go for it as
long as you're careful.

28:51.107 --> 28:53.987
Like changing your name, making
sure you can't be traced.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.891
Yeah, I guess you've got
lots of time on your hands

28:57.923 --> 29:01.347
so why not live out one of your
desires.

29:01.380 --> 29:02.179
And if it's not for you,

29:02.211 --> 29:03.971
you can always close down the
account.

29:05.603 --> 29:07.458
Yeah, when I registered they
said they'd shut the account

29:07.491 --> 29:09.507
as soon as I ask them to.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.619
Hold on. You've already signed
up?

29:13.379 --> 29:14.211
Yeah.

29:14.243 --> 29:16.515
I already posted two photos.

29:16.547 --> 29:19.427
Oh my God, Jenna,
why didn't you tell us?

29:19.459 --> 29:20.419
Shit.

29:21.987 --> 29:23.074
Eh? This morning.

29:24.835 --> 29:25.987
Are you gonna go nude?

29:27.587 --> 29:29.763
No, absolutely not, no.

29:29.794 --> 29:31.714
That's something I said to
myself.

29:31.747 --> 29:33.027
No nudity.

29:33.060 --> 29:37.635
Just a sort of dance show, you
know.

29:37.667 --> 29:40.291
You're gonna get guys
riled up doing that, Jenna.

29:41.123 --> 29:42.243
Isn't that the point?

29:44.227 --> 29:46.404
But what if they wanna
see what's underneath?

29:47.427 --> 29:49.284
I guess everyone has a price,
huh?

29:49.987 --> 29:53.187
No, it's not part of the
fantasy for me.

29:53.220 --> 29:57.699
I like the idea of them seeing
me, watching me, paying me,

29:57.731 --> 30:00.579
but no nudity, no sexual acts.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.155
So when you gonna do your
first show?

30:07.299 --> 30:08.131
Tonight.

30:08.995 --> 30:09.858
Oh wow.

30:10.660 --> 30:13.220
How many subscribers have you
got?

30:13.251 --> 30:15.651
I'm just over a hundred I
think.

30:15.683 --> 30:18.754
So not that many but hopefully
I'll get more with time.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.491
Go on, open it.

30:33.219 --> 30:35.043
I want you to put that collar
on.

30:36.771 --> 30:38.723
Go on, like my little puppy.

30:39.618 --> 30:40.707
Do as I say.

30:42.051 --> 30:43.331
My mother is here.

30:44.036 --> 30:46.338
She could walk in at any moment.

30:46.371 --> 30:48.451
Do you want to be my
little slave or not?

31:12.355 --> 31:14.275
I bet you wish that was you,
huh?

31:17.058 --> 31:18.915
What next, Mistress?

31:21.411 --> 31:24.260
Should be another
little gift in the box.

31:24.291 --> 31:25.284
Have a look.

31:35.491 --> 31:36.579
Kiss my boot.

31:44.324 --> 31:46.947
Uh uh uh. I hadn't finished.

31:50.595 --> 31:53.827
Hold your collar and pull on it
choking.

32:33.091 --> 32:35.715
Hey, Miss Chelks.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.251
I got another parcel for you.

32:37.284 --> 32:39.522
Isn't there something I need
to sign?

32:39.555 --> 32:41.156
Oh, oh, can you sign this for
me?

32:41.187 --> 32:42.595
Sure.

32:46.051 --> 32:46.916
Thanks.

32:49.539 --> 32:50.980
I'll catch you later, yeah?

33:48.738 --> 33:49.988
What the hell?

34:18.147 --> 34:20.835
No, honestly, though,
appearance is everything.

34:24.643 --> 34:26.242
Do you think they'll like it?

34:28.065 --> 34:28.931
Cute.

34:32.067 --> 34:35.172
You gotta know what your
audience wants and play to that.

34:35.204 --> 34:38.052
Teach me how to do an actual
cam show.

34:39.554 --> 34:42.627
Hm, okay, sit back and act as
though

34:42.658 --> 34:43.491
you were my.

34:44.868 --> 34:45.987
Okay.

34:46.020 --> 34:47.619
Serious. You've gotta
know what they want.

34:47.652 --> 34:52.322
Get yourself in the zone
and see what turns you on.

34:52.355 --> 34:53.217
Ready?

35:52.964 --> 35:53.828
Hey, Kell.

35:54.595 --> 35:57.572
Right, the weirdest thing just
happened.

35:58.659 --> 36:00.258
Go on.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.795
Liam sent me a police uniform.

36:03.684 --> 36:05.026
Random.

36:05.058 --> 36:05.922
Isn't it?

36:07.587 --> 36:09.315
Why did he send you that?

36:09.348 --> 36:10.755
I don't know.

36:11.650 --> 36:15.108
I mean, well, we had
a chat the other night

36:15.139 --> 36:18.788
but I don't know...

36:18.819 --> 36:19.652
Go on.

36:19.683 --> 36:20.868
You can tell me.

36:22.020 --> 36:23.684
Come on, don't leave me hanging.

36:25.282 --> 36:26.755
Okay.

36:26.787 --> 36:29.604
So... so basically the other
night,

36:30.468 --> 36:33.348
we sort of ended up sexting

36:33.379 --> 36:35.811
about me being with another guy.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.747
Oh. Really?

36:39.779 --> 36:41.187
Yeah.

36:41.220 --> 36:42.498
It was really hot.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.668
So you know how I told you
about how I've been thinking

36:45.699 --> 36:46.851
about my ex?

36:46.884 --> 36:49.186
Well, I told him and then, you
know,

36:49.218 --> 36:52.163
one thing led to another and
yeah,

36:52.196 --> 36:54.915
we just began talking
about me with another man.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.228
But then, I don't know,

36:56.259 --> 36:57.507
we haven't said a word about it
since

36:57.540 --> 36:59.811
and suddenly this parcel comes
today.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.988
And he texted me and he said...

37:02.019 --> 37:05.187
he said, "You love a
man in uniform, right?"

37:05.220 --> 37:06.084
And you do.

37:07.107 --> 37:08.675
I'm just so confused.

37:10.659 --> 37:13.122
Are you though, really?

37:13.155 --> 37:15.395
What do you mean?

37:15.428 --> 37:17.283
Well, think about it.

37:17.315 --> 37:19.524
It's true, you do like a man in
uniform.

37:19.555 --> 37:23.075
So maybe he's just initiating
something

37:23.108 --> 37:24.355
so it really happens.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.643
What you think he
sent me a used uniform?

37:28.676 --> 37:30.147
Maybe.

37:30.180 --> 37:32.931
One step closer to another man,
eh?

37:34.851 --> 37:37.379
Oh my God.

37:38.307 --> 37:39.395
So what do you think?

37:40.995 --> 37:42.308
Don't know.

37:42.339 --> 37:43.524
It's just all a bit sudden
really.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.923
I mean, I wasn't expecting
anything like this.

37:47.012 --> 37:47.876
But...

37:50.019 --> 37:50.883
But...

37:51.812 --> 37:53.732
Yeah, I mean, it's kinda kinky.

37:55.459 --> 37:56.772
Yeah, just go with it.

37:56.803 --> 37:58.884
You won't know unless you try.

37:58.915 --> 38:00.771
Yeah.

38:28.323 --> 38:31.907
The idea that a man could
be doing this to open them,

38:31.939 --> 38:34.755
I suddenly have an urge.

39:41.091 --> 39:42.275
You look hot.

39:43.235 --> 39:44.451
Yeah, you too.

39:46.435 --> 39:49.315
Can you smell the scent of
another man?

39:49.347 --> 39:51.235
Made sure it was secondhand.

39:53.123 --> 39:56.899
You cheeky boy.

40:03.363 --> 40:05.571
I want to watch you

40:05.603 --> 40:07.139
with the scent of another man

40:07.172 --> 40:08.963
while you please yourself.

40:13.347 --> 40:15.299
I want you to picture a
policeman

40:15.331 --> 40:17.187
who's just come by to check
you're okay

40:17.219 --> 40:18.852
in that big house.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.323
I want you to picture the
policeman being turned on.

40:25.443 --> 40:27.171
He looks you up and down.

40:27.203 --> 40:28.259
You notice then.

40:32.835 --> 40:34.019
You offer him a drink.

40:36.419 --> 40:38.915
Before you know it, he eyes you,

40:38.947 --> 40:41.155
holding his gaze longer than he
should.

40:52.323 --> 40:55.139
Touching your thigh.

40:55.171 --> 40:57.283
Telling you you're beautiful.

41:01.635 --> 41:03.747
He spots the wedding ring.

41:05.155 --> 41:06.979
He doesn't care that you're
married.

41:08.963 --> 41:11.555
He just wants to touch a married
lady.

41:25.987 --> 41:28.131
He continues touching you.

41:28.163 --> 41:29.411
- Oh!
- Again.

41:30.531 --> 41:31.395
And again.

41:32.772 --> 41:34.692
And again till he slips

41:36.803 --> 41:38.115
inside of you.

41:45.252 --> 41:49.923
Oh Oh oh.

41:49.955 --> 41:54.179
Oh.

41:54.211 --> 41:58.531
Oh.

43:39.715 --> 43:41.315
Hi, guys. Belle here.

43:53.987 --> 43:55.683
Is no one interested?

44:24.419 --> 44:26.563
Wow, thanks, guys.

44:27.459 --> 44:28.707
I'm 18.

44:40.163 --> 44:41.795
This is my first show.

44:50.787 --> 44:51.684
Thank you.

44:56.035 --> 45:00.963
Wow, that was um, that was
generous of you, Mr. Pinter.

46:04.740 --> 46:06.339
What tonight, Mistress?

46:08.259 --> 46:10.436
Remember that time we
had a menage a trois?

46:12.195 --> 46:13.954
Sure as hell I do.

46:13.987 --> 46:16.643
Did you enjoy me and
another woman sharing you?

46:17.987 --> 46:20.418
Yes, I did.

46:20.451 --> 46:21.827
Did you enjoy it?

46:21.860 --> 46:22.723
I did.

46:24.227 --> 46:26.467
Well, it's a shame with
the current situation

46:26.499 --> 46:28.611
that you can't share
me with somebody else.

46:29.955 --> 46:31.938
Well, it's not about you
anymore.

46:31.971 --> 46:34.275
It's about me and my desires.

46:34.308 --> 46:37.763
So sit back and watch your
mistress work.

46:42.020 --> 46:42.915
Hi, Foxy-Lyne.

46:46.755 --> 46:47.683
Hello, Mistress.

46:49.443 --> 46:51.171
My little puppy is watching.

46:54.243 --> 46:56.356
Reveal yourself to your
mistress.

47:01.188 --> 47:06.084
Get a load of this.

47:18.692 --> 47:20.547
You like what you see?

48:29.412 --> 48:30.274
Ah!

48:31.428 --> 48:32.292
Ah!

48:57.571 --> 48:58.436
Ah!

49:00.164 --> 49:01.027
Ah!

49:01.954 --> 49:02.818
Ah!

49:04.611 --> 49:05.442
Ah!

49:15.492 --> 49:16.354
Mm.

49:18.404 --> 49:19.234
Ah.

49:38.532 --> 49:39.395
Shh.

49:47.427 --> 49:48.291
Shh.

50:30.339 --> 50:32.995
Well, hello there, BartyBoy.

52:27.395 --> 52:31.938
Oh.

52:52.611 --> 52:54.308
It was hot seeing you
get off over the smell

52:54.339 --> 52:55.235
of another guy.

53:01.666 --> 53:03.812
You know what would be hot?

53:05.251 --> 53:06.084
Go on.

53:08.739 --> 53:13.603
Seeing you with another man
for real.

53:13.635 --> 53:16.483
Would that actually turn you
on?

53:17.315 --> 53:18.372
I think so.

53:19.332 --> 53:23.139
To like actually see me
with another man inside me.

53:24.772 --> 53:25.602
Yeah.

53:28.643 --> 53:29.475
Maybe.

53:30.819 --> 53:32.322
Anyone in mind?

53:33.315 --> 53:35.235
Like who?

53:35.266 --> 53:36.612
Like a celebrity?

53:37.891 --> 53:39.267
Someone more realistic.

53:41.283 --> 53:42.147
Someone we know.

53:43.587 --> 53:47.427
Don't know. No one
I can really think of.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.219
Anyone from my work?

53:50.371 --> 53:51.235
Um...

53:52.227 --> 53:54.755
Well, that Tared was okay.

53:54.788 --> 53:57.635
He doesn't work
in the office anymore.

53:57.668 --> 54:02.243
Oh.

54:04.771 --> 54:06.275
The new postman's hot.

54:07.139 --> 54:08.003
Really?

54:10.851 --> 54:12.195
Yeah.

54:12.228 --> 54:13.892
He came to deliver something the
other day

54:13.923 --> 54:15.843
and, yeah, he was hot.

54:17.699 --> 54:19.683
Would you want him
inside of you?

54:19.715 --> 54:20.547
I think so.

54:22.884 --> 54:24.259
Don't hold back.

54:26.499 --> 54:28.067
Yes.

54:28.099 --> 54:29.987
If he was there now,

54:30.019 --> 54:31.939
would you let him?

54:31.971 --> 54:32.835
Yes.

54:34.019 --> 54:35.682
How would it happen?

54:38.723 --> 54:40.227
I'd invite him in for a
coffee.

54:41.507 --> 54:44.387
Then?

54:44.419 --> 54:47.555
Well, I'd probably tell
him how frustrated I've been,

54:47.587 --> 54:50.787
all alone in this house
without my fiance here.

54:50.819 --> 54:52.131
Then?

54:53.635 --> 54:55.107
Then I'd let him kiss me.

54:56.067 --> 55:00.003
Where would
you let him take you?

55:00.035 --> 55:01.379
In our bed.

55:07.779 --> 55:10.436
I'm about to order
something next day delivery.

55:10.467 --> 55:13.122
Tell me when he's in the house.

58:33.827 --> 58:34.979
Ah, typical.

58:57.283 --> 58:58.947
Oh. Hey, BartyBoy.

59:06.019 --> 59:07.523
Um, how are you?

59:11.427 --> 59:12.291
Good.

59:15.812 --> 59:17.251
Do you like what you see?

59:18.403 --> 59:19.587
I wore something special for
you.

59:30.563 --> 59:31.459
A request?

59:32.739 --> 59:34.403
I can pose for you if you like.

59:55.075 --> 59:56.867
I would like that.

01:00:06.307 --> 01:00:07.139
Ah.

01:00:15.618 --> 01:00:16.803
Yes.

01:00:16.835 --> 01:00:17.699
Yeah.

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:21.378
Lucky or what?

01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:23.427
My first night on there
and I literally met a guy

01:00:23.459 --> 01:00:24.707
who treats me better than any
guy

01:00:24.739 --> 01:00:26.627
I've ever been with ever before.

01:00:26.659 --> 01:00:29.058
Plus he said he's gonna pay me
double.

01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.227
Let me repeat, double
what I earned last night

01:00:32.259 --> 01:00:33.507
if I don't come tonight.

01:00:35.747 --> 01:00:37.347
Oh, babe, this sounds lush.

01:00:38.372 --> 01:00:40.067
Perfect guy.

01:00:40.099 --> 01:00:41.891
I mean, he's gotta be loaded,
right?

01:00:41.923 --> 01:00:44.418
Who can casually just afford
1.2K?

01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:48.227
Well, maybe he's not
spending cash online like I am.

01:00:48.258 --> 01:00:50.659
He's got plenty of money
to spend during lockdown.

01:00:52.227 --> 01:00:54.564
Talking of splashing in
lockdown...

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:56.484
My postman is really hot.

01:00:58.147 --> 01:00:58.979
Since when?

01:00:59.651 --> 01:01:01.571
Since I got a new one
yesterday.

01:01:02.372 --> 01:01:05.603
And me and Liam have been
talking more and more

01:01:05.635 --> 01:01:07.779
about the idea of another man.

01:01:09.603 --> 01:01:11.459
I'm gonna need another
glass of wine for this

01:01:11.491 --> 01:01:12.900
but please don't stop.

01:01:12.932 --> 01:01:16.451
The idea of me being with
another guy really turns him on.

01:01:16.483 --> 01:01:19.907
He basically asked me who I
thought was hot but realistic

01:01:19.938 --> 01:01:20.803
to screw me.

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:23.747
And you said the postman?

01:01:25.091 --> 01:01:27.107
Honestly, he's hot.

01:01:27.139 --> 01:01:29.092
No, seriously, his muscles
were practically bursting

01:01:29.124 --> 01:01:30.371
through his clothes.

01:01:31.714 --> 01:01:33.315
And what did Liam say?

01:01:33.347 --> 01:01:35.203
He's ordered me a next day
delivery.

01:01:35.235 --> 01:01:36.804
Told me to open it in front of
him.

01:01:38.307 --> 01:01:40.611
What do you think will be in
the parcel?

01:01:40.644 --> 01:01:41.987
Don't know.

01:01:42.018 --> 01:01:43.363
Guess I'll find out tomorrow.

01:01:44.163 --> 01:01:46.404
But obviously now that
lockdown's starting to ease

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.931
a little bit, we're allowed
to see one other person,

01:01:48.963 --> 01:01:50.691
and I can't see Liam 'cause he's
abroad

01:01:50.723 --> 01:01:54.467
so maybe this could be
my one other contact?

01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:58.820
Well, the Dutch government
have issued guidance

01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:03.684
to find a fuck buddy so, babe,
maybe you found your one.

01:02:03.716 --> 01:02:04.740
What do you mean the Dutch
government

01:02:04.772 --> 01:02:07.267
have told people to find a fuck
buddy?

01:02:07.299 --> 01:02:08.995
They've issued guidance to
single people

01:02:09.027 --> 01:02:11.747
seeking intimacy during the
pandemic.

01:02:11.778 --> 01:02:15.267
They said that they
should find a sex buddy.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.187
So the question is, Kelly,

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.027
have Liam given you
permission to fuck this guy?

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.844
Well, he said he wants to
know when he's in the house.

01:02:28.131 --> 01:02:31.011
This is
so naughty. I love it.

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:35.268
Well, can I just say it
before I get too carried away?

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.244
Look, okay, what if this a
really hot idea and everything

01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:41.507
but then when it comes down
to it and I actually do it,

01:02:41.538 --> 01:02:43.491
but what if he doesn't find
it hot anymore, you know,

01:02:43.523 --> 01:02:45.763
and then it's too late,
I've already done it?

01:02:48.804 --> 01:02:49.924
Well, you've just gotta trust

01:02:49.956 --> 01:02:54.178
that if he says he's fine with
it, he'll be fine with it.

01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:57.540
You've done this before,
haven't you, Nessa?

01:02:57.572 --> 01:02:58.947
What was it like for you?

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.683
Well, Steven and I have got
a very trusting relationship

01:03:03.715 --> 01:03:06.051
so it was fine for us.

01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:08.836
And it's fine too being in
a monogamous relationship.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.740
I'm not gonna lie, I really
enjoyed

01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:14.371
sharing another girl with him.

01:03:15.427 --> 01:03:16.995
We always refer back to it.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.987
I was so, I just got this
jealousy

01:03:22.018 --> 01:03:24.642
when she had him before
me and I loved it too.

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:27.587
It just, something inside me
just made me

01:03:27.618 --> 01:03:29.028
wanted to control him.

01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:32.868
I think we fucked every day from
then on.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.587
But, as Ness said,
it isn't for everyone.

01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:38.338
Yeah, it's tricky.

01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:41.891
I mean, Steve and I are
in a longterm marriage.

01:03:43.524 --> 01:03:45.827
It's gonna get stale after
nearly a decade

01:03:45.858 --> 01:03:47.011
of being together.

01:03:47.778 --> 01:03:50.340
I've only been with two guys
before him.

01:03:50.372 --> 01:03:53.028
So I haven't really
experienced men properly.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.884
I always say this. I
think I met him too early.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:00.483
Like, if I'd met him a little
later,

01:04:00.514 --> 01:04:04.195
I could've gotten out all
the urges on my own maybe.

01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:07.907
Oh, I don't know. I guess
there's always something in me

01:04:07.938 --> 01:04:10.851
that wants to explore and him
too.

01:04:12.707 --> 01:04:16.196
What I'm trying to say is that
it's not always for everyone.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:17.380
You've just gotta make sure

01:04:17.411 --> 01:04:22.338
that you're extremely
comfortable with it and with him.

01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:23.748
So the question is, are you?

01:04:25.315 --> 01:04:27.394
Yeah, I mean, I think so.

01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:31.907
How would you feel about
him being inside another lady?

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.963
Oh God. I've not really
thought about that one.

01:04:36.994 --> 01:04:38.818
But you've thought about
it the other way around,

01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:41.060
you being with a man.

01:04:41.091 --> 01:04:42.211
Yeah.

01:04:42.244 --> 01:04:45.700
I mean, when I'm alone, I
still think about other people.

01:04:45.732 --> 01:04:47.523
But that's normal, right?

01:04:48.675 --> 01:04:50.532
Of course it's normal.

01:04:50.564 --> 01:04:51.331
We're not put on this earth

01:04:51.363 --> 01:04:54.307
to just mate with one other
person.

01:04:54.339 --> 01:04:56.324
We're supposed to have sex with
many.

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:58.114
It's in our blood.

01:04:58.147 --> 01:05:00.260
Don't feel bad because you
don't wanna bang his brains out

01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:01.188
all the time.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.843
It's normal to have
urges for other people,

01:05:04.547 --> 01:05:07.908
other men, and if you're
like me, other women too.

01:05:09.603 --> 01:05:10.594
I wanna do it.

01:05:11.715 --> 01:05:13.378
I'm just scared.

01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:15.138
I don't wanna lose him, you
know.

01:05:17.379 --> 01:05:20.002
You've just gotta decide
what's right for you,

01:05:20.035 --> 01:05:21.188
for you and him.

01:05:22.275 --> 01:05:23.651
Only you will know, babe.

01:05:25.028 --> 01:05:26.307
But, you know, you'll
probably know tomorrow

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.651
when the postman comes.

01:05:28.803 --> 01:05:30.020
I mean, I guess I wouldn't be
breaking

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:31.844
any lockdown restrictions.

01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:33.699
I heard on the news earlier
you're allowed to socialize

01:05:33.732 --> 01:05:35.684
with one person from another
household.

01:05:36.771 --> 01:05:39.428
You just need to ask
yourself is he the one person

01:05:39.459 --> 01:05:41.315
you want to mix with during
lockdown?

01:06:39.267 --> 01:06:44.322
Hey, Miss Chelks, I got
another parcel for you.

01:06:44.355 --> 01:06:45.668
Great. Thanks.

01:07:12.931 --> 01:07:14.660
Now can you sign this for me?

01:07:14.691 --> 01:07:15.555
Sure.

01:07:32.067 --> 01:07:33.027
Thanks.

01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:37.282
Ready to snap my photo?

01:07:37.315 --> 01:07:38.755
Uh, yeah.

01:07:46.851 --> 01:07:47.972
Yeah, that's good.

01:07:52.164 --> 01:07:54.692
Well, I'll catch you later,
yeah?

01:07:58.724 --> 01:07:59.588
Hey.

01:08:01.572 --> 01:08:03.363
Help me with something?

01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:06.275
Sure.

01:08:27.524 --> 01:08:29.156
Two sugars was it?

01:08:29.187 --> 01:08:31.107
Yeah, that's the one.

01:08:33.091 --> 01:08:35.841
Nice and sweet. Just how I
like it.

01:08:37.955 --> 01:08:40.099
You do know we shouldn't be
this close

01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:42.948
with the lockdown and all.

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:44.707
Well, we're here now.

01:08:44.738 --> 01:08:47.298
I haven't left my house in weeks
so...

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:49.764
I've been seeing people every
day.

01:08:49.795 --> 01:08:52.740
Yeah, but I'm sure
you're careful, aren't you?

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:55.459
You're wearing anti-bag, wearing
gloves.

01:08:57.154 --> 01:08:58.818
And I always sing
"Happy Birthday" twice.

01:09:00.738 --> 01:09:01.827
You cheeky fucker.

01:09:09.411 --> 01:09:11.492
So what's in the package?

01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:12.356
Oh.

01:09:20.484 --> 01:09:21.956
Not gonna use that.

01:09:21.987 --> 01:09:22.916
And it's worse for me.

01:09:35.011 --> 01:09:36.130
What you got?

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:41.571
Shit.

01:09:41.604 --> 01:09:43.459
I shouldn't have asked.

01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:46.179
No, it's fine.

01:09:46.212 --> 01:09:48.259
I wasn't expecting it
to arrive so quickly.

01:09:49.028 --> 01:09:50.852
I am sure I've delivered
plenty of those

01:09:50.883 --> 01:09:52.611
over the last few weeks.

01:09:52.643 --> 01:09:55.939
Oh, I'm sure you have.

01:09:55.971 --> 01:09:58.020
There's a lot of frustrated
energy out there.

01:09:58.051 --> 01:09:59.619
Yeah.

01:09:59.652 --> 01:10:03.588
A lot of people, alone in
their houses.

01:10:03.619 --> 01:10:06.116
Nothing to do, time to kill.

01:10:07.524 --> 01:10:09.092
Can really build up, you know.

01:10:09.859 --> 01:10:13.955
Can really make a woman
desire out-of-the-box things.

01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:18.692
Like what?

01:10:21.059 --> 01:10:22.242
Men in uniform.

01:10:24.579 --> 01:10:27.075
You didn't need my help
with anything, do you?

01:10:28.035 --> 01:10:29.475
Sorry?

01:10:29.508 --> 01:10:32.067
There's nothing here
for me to do is there?

01:10:32.099 --> 01:10:34.052
You don't need help with
anything.

01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:37.123
Oh no, I need help.

01:10:37.155 --> 01:10:38.948
I assure you.

01:10:38.979 --> 01:10:39.972
With what?

01:11:46.851 --> 01:11:47.683
Oh God.

01:12:31.459 --> 01:12:33.059
Yes.

01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:33.956
Oh, oh.

01:12:35.203 --> 01:12:36.067
Oh yes.

01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:46.403
It was insane. I can't
stop thinking about it.

01:12:46.436 --> 01:12:48.579
Like this huge weight of
sexual fantasy's been lifted

01:12:48.612 --> 01:12:49.507
from my head.

01:12:50.563 --> 01:12:54.083
This is so scandalous. I love
it.

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:56.003
What did Liam say?

01:12:57.059 --> 01:12:58.212
Oh, he loved it.

01:12:58.243 --> 01:12:59.779
It really turned him on.

01:12:59.811 --> 01:13:03.683
He wanted every single detail.

01:13:03.716 --> 01:13:05.859
So, are you gonna do it again?

01:13:07.139 --> 01:13:09.027
Well, Liam's already ordered

01:13:09.059 --> 01:13:12.739
another next day delivery so...

01:13:15.171 --> 01:13:16.579
This is amazing.

01:13:18.468 --> 01:13:20.195
Okay, Jenna, your turn.

01:13:20.227 --> 01:13:22.916
How is it your end with your
webcam show?

01:13:22.947 --> 01:13:24.259
Did you show him your body?

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:26.691
And don't you lie.

01:13:26.723 --> 01:13:27.587
No.

01:13:28.611 --> 01:13:29.892
It's really weird though.

01:13:29.923 --> 01:13:31.491
Like we actually have

01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:34.403
like a genuine connection, like
really.

01:13:35.299 --> 01:13:36.259
So we're meeting.

01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:41.315
Wait, sorry, actually meeting?

01:13:42.467 --> 01:13:43.332
Yeah.

01:13:44.195 --> 01:13:47.331
You're meeting a guy
off a cam girl site?

01:13:47.363 --> 01:13:49.763
Don't you think that's a bit
dangerous?

01:13:49.796 --> 01:13:51.139
What if he's got the virus?

01:13:52.643 --> 01:13:54.723
No. He's fine.

01:13:54.755 --> 01:13:55.395
I even asked him.

01:13:55.427 --> 01:13:57.635
He said he's virus-free, so...

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:58.915
We've been talking for hours now

01:13:58.947 --> 01:14:01.603
and I've seen a few photos.

01:14:01.635 --> 01:14:02.499
It'll be fine.

01:14:03.299 --> 01:14:05.571
We've been talking probably
more than I talk to most people

01:14:05.603 --> 01:14:08.131
that I meet off the internet for
dates.

01:14:08.163 --> 01:14:11.267
Like, I feel like I know him.

01:14:13.763 --> 01:14:14.659
If you're sure.

01:14:16.131 --> 01:14:17.059
I am.

01:14:17.091 --> 01:14:19.651
You can meet people in
the most unusual places.

01:14:22.563 --> 01:14:24.195
But, I'll keep you updated.

01:14:24.931 --> 01:14:26.403
Speak to you, girls.

01:14:30.947 --> 01:14:32.771
Do I or don't I?

01:15:37.379 --> 01:15:39.075
Well, hey there, Belle.

01:15:41.251 --> 01:15:42.243
So what's up, Belle?

01:15:43.971 --> 01:15:44.803
I'm...

01:15:46.243 --> 01:15:47.875
You look so different.

01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:51.747
Yeah, the photos were old.

01:15:53.987 --> 01:15:54.851
Okay.

01:16:00.227 --> 01:16:01.187
So can I come in?

01:16:05.123 --> 01:16:06.563
It's still me, BartyBoy.

01:16:08.355 --> 01:16:09.795
No, sorry.

01:16:09.827 --> 01:16:11.043
I don't know what you
thought was gonna happen,

01:16:11.075 --> 01:16:13.763
but you're not the photos.

01:16:13.795 --> 01:16:15.139
You're not you.

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:16.643
So no.

01:16:22.307 --> 01:16:24.515
Um... you should have the
confidence

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:27.427
to just be you, you know.

01:16:28.547 --> 01:16:29.603
Okay, have a good one.

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:45.315
So what time will you be
home to your mistress tomorrow?

01:16:45.347 --> 01:16:47.683
Around midday.

01:16:48.611 --> 01:16:50.371
Good. I'll be waiting.

01:16:53.058 --> 01:16:57.411
Are you ready to experience the
full power of your mistress?

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.324
I am.

01:17:02.211 --> 01:17:03.139
I am what?

01:17:05.603 --> 01:17:06.595
Mistress.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.067
Fantasy over for Belle.

01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:27.075
What do you mean it wasn't
him?

01:17:27.107 --> 01:17:28.515
Catfish.

01:17:28.547 --> 01:17:30.947
You were right but whatever.

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:31.907
It wasn't for me.

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:34.627
You know, the fantasy of
being watched by others

01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:36.419
is over for me.

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:39.459
I get the excitement but,
yeah, it just wasn't for me

01:17:39.491 --> 01:17:40.354
in the end.

01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:43.587
Well, speak for yourself.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.947
I'm waiting for my fantasy
to turn up with my package.

01:17:46.979 --> 01:17:49.380
Well, both of my packages.

01:17:51.587 --> 01:17:53.156
And I'm waiting for my little
puppy

01:17:53.187 --> 01:17:56.771
to come home to his master.

01:17:56.803 --> 01:17:59.202
It's all about trying things
out,

01:17:59.235 --> 01:18:01.571
seeing what your comfort zones
are.

01:18:01.603 --> 01:18:02.660
You won't know until you try.

01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:06.018
And instead of letting things
dry up,

01:18:06.051 --> 01:18:08.420
they can fire up.

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:09.476
I think people just need

01:18:09.507 --> 01:18:13.059
to be more open, more
adventurous.

01:18:13.091 --> 01:18:14.658
That way, everyone could have
more fun

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:15.779
with their sex lives.

01:19:25.123 --> 01:19:27.587
It's all about trying
things out,

01:19:27.618 --> 01:19:29.411
seeing what your comfort zones
are.

01:19:36.323 --> 01:19:37.443
You won't know until you try

01:19:37.474 --> 01:19:40.354
and instead of letting
things get dried up,

01:19:40.387 --> 01:19:41.604
keep them fired up.

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:06.372
I think people need to be

01:20:06.404 --> 01:20:09.507
more open, more willing.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.778
They could have so much better
sex lives.

01:20:40.164 --> 01:20:43.875
Things have changed.
Attitudes have changed.

01:22:46.595 --> 01:22:49.539
We can't go back to how things
were

01:22:49.572 --> 01:22:52.227
not after your freedom has
been chained up for weeks.

01:23:06.658 --> 01:23:08.772
This is a new normal now.

01:23:08.804 --> 01:23:12.740
We've adapted and this is
how we face the future.
