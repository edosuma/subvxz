You know he can't

He doesn't

Good morning, Veronica.

lick your face again?

Nope!

Today's the day I'm finally
buying my own dog,

00:56.990 --> 00:58.892
and I'll love it,
and it'll love me,

00:58.926 --> 01:00.694
and it'll take care of me

Okay.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.798
Aw, these dogs are so cute.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.900
The Dalmatian
is so spotty.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.703
The corgi is so smiley.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.440
And the bulldog's face
is so smashy

01:12.473 --> 01:16.410
and his skin is so loosey,
and here's a big old sausage.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.112
These are the best dogs.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.448
Actually, these
are the worst dogs.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.787
Dog.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.489
I just have to pick
which breed.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.691
Sorry, but not only
are purebred dogs

02:03.724 --> 02:05.193
riddled with genetic disease,

02:05.226 --> 02:07.495
dog breeds aren't
even a real thing.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.496
We made them up.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.530
What?

02:09.563 --> 02:10.764
We talk about dog breeds

02:10.798 --> 02:12.966
as though God
created them that way.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.338
And on the 788th day,
God created the corgi.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.307
And he was a good boy.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.341
(Adam)
And as though every mutt

02:20.374 --> 02:22.210
were just a mix
of different purebreds.

02:22.243 --> 02:26.214
Miles is one-eighth terrier,
a quarter spaniel, half-collie,

02:26.247 --> 02:28.549
and, according
to an old family legend,

02:28.582 --> 02:31.285
his great-great-grandfather
was a dire wolf.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.053
(Adam)
But that's backwards.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.489
Mutts are dogs
in their natural state.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.992
Humans have lived
with domesticated dogs
for over 10,000 years,

02:39.026 --> 02:41.829
but so called pure-bred
dogs didn't even exist

02:41.862 --> 02:44.064
until just 150 years ago.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.033
Wait, really?
Where do they come from?

02:46.066 --> 02:49.237
The fact is,
pure breeding is a form
of genetic manipulation

02:49.270 --> 02:51.872
humans made up just
to amuse ourselves.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.074
In 19th century
Victorian England,

02:54.107 --> 02:55.876
eugenics was all the rage,

02:55.909 --> 02:59.647
and competitive dog breeding
became a weird, fancy fad.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.217
I made a dog
with super loose skin.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.519
I made one
with a super flat,

03:05.553 --> 03:06.887
(bleep)-up face.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.390
Oh, now,
that is disturbing.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.025
I'm your god now.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.762
Once these Dr. Frankensteins
were satisfied,

03:14.795 --> 03:17.398
they dubbed their little
monsters "pure breeds"

03:17.431 --> 03:21.168
and used kennel clubs to enforce
their bizarre standards.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.337
(thunder crashes)
Behold my newest creation.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.105
The corgi.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.841
A corgi is 10 to 12 inches
tall with a foxy head,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.344
wide, flat skull,
and non-sly expression,

03:30.378 --> 03:32.580
so if your dog looks sly,

03:32.613 --> 03:35.849
it's a poser freak,
and it's out of the club!

03:35.883 --> 03:36.917
(thunder crashes)

03:36.950 --> 03:39.019
That's all
a corgi really is.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.722
An arbitrary definition
made up by a weirdo.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.591
Okay, but when you
get a purebred,

03:43.624 --> 03:45.959
you get a good,
healthy dog, right?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.761
Nope! When you hear
"purebred,"

03:47.795 --> 03:49.697
you should think "inbred."

03:49.730 --> 03:52.866
Inbred?
Like a hot dog?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.268
Adorable, but no.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.937
Kennel clubs
prohibit purebred dogs

03:56.970 --> 03:59.239
from mating outside
their breed, and often,

03:59.273 --> 04:01.442
they're mated members
of their own family,

04:01.475 --> 04:04.745
making the average pug
as inbred as an Austrian duke.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.581
My blood is very pure.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.216
(groans, thud)

04:09.249 --> 04:12.786
Well, maybe inbreeding
is not that bad.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.788
We concur--
inbreeding is quite natural,

04:14.822 --> 04:15.889
isn't it, sister?

04:15.923 --> 04:19.393
(both)
Mm... mm... mm...

04:19.427 --> 04:21.295
Ugh, definitely not.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.831
The sad truth is,
purebred dogs suffer

04:23.864 --> 04:26.567
from disturbingly high rates
of genetic disease.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.303
It's because of a problem called
the genetic bottleneck.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.171
Here to explain
is Dr. Kirk Lohmueller,

04:31.204 --> 04:33.307
professor of evolution at UCLA.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.508
(Professor Lohmueller)
Hi, Adam.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.976
Here's the problem
with pure breeding.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.811
When species breed
in the wild,

04:37.845 --> 04:39.780
they can exist
in large populations

04:39.813 --> 04:41.148
and can mate randomly.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.983
This ensures a nice,
healthy distribution

04:43.016 --> 04:44.485
of genetic variation.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.487
But when humans
started pure breeding dogs,

04:46.520 --> 04:49.323
we had them mate over and over
again with their relatives

04:49.357 --> 04:51.425
to get a specific look.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.194
When we artificially limited
the gene pool in that way,

04:54.227 --> 04:55.996
we created a genetic bottleneck.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.198
As the same
small gene pool is spread

04:58.231 --> 04:59.767
between more and more dogs,

04:59.800 --> 05:03.604
diseases that would normally
be rare become inevitable.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.341
But wouldn't a good breeder
only mate the healthy ones?

05:07.375 --> 05:09.477
Like, "No thanks,
weird scrub dog.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.844
You're not having sex
with no one."

05:10.878 --> 05:12.546
Well, you can try.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.881
(eraser squeaking)

05:13.914 --> 05:16.384
But if you don't increase
the size of the gene pool,

05:16.417 --> 05:18.452
you're gonna keep creating
abnormal dogs.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.522
Tiny physical defects,
like smaller noses, for example,

05:21.555 --> 05:23.524
might get
worse and worse over time,

05:23.557 --> 05:26.560
until it becomes impossible
for the dog to breathe.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.962
(dog rasping)

05:28.996 --> 05:32.533
The reality is, pure breeding
leads to unhealthy dogs.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.234
I hate
this class.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.369
Thanks, Kirk!

05:35.403 --> 05:36.637
Bye, guys.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.039
And those diseases
are real serious.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.743
60% of golden retrievers
die of cancer.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.245
An estimated 95%
of King Charles spaniels

05:45.278 --> 05:48.348
have skulls that are too
small for their brains.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.652
Pugs' faces are so flat,
they reverse sneeze.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.987
Great Danes are so huge,
they get bone tumors

05:54.021 --> 05:55.389
from supporting
their own weight.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.257
And as for toy breeds,

05:57.290 --> 05:59.660
have you ever seen a little
tiny dog that looked happy?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.328
They know there's something
wrong with them,

06:01.361 --> 06:03.564
and they know
that we did it to them.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.966
(Spanish accent)
I'm a freak, on a leash!

06:07.535 --> 06:10.404
And now, we come
to the English bulldog.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.572
Aw, so cute.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.740
Yeah, he is.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.842
If you find total
genetic failure cute.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.176
(whimpering)

06:16.209 --> 06:18.111
The bulldog
was once a proud breed,

06:18.145 --> 06:20.748
but a century of extreme
breeding has ruined them.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.784
Their noses are so squashed,
they can barely breathe.

06:23.817 --> 06:27.120
Their heads are so big, they're
usually born by C-section.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.189
Their tails
can become ingrown.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.258
They basically all
have hip dysplasia,

06:31.291 --> 06:34.928
and their average life
expectancy is six years.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.298
Frankly, it's surprising
these dogs can even survive.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.733
What?

06:39.767 --> 06:41.769
Oliver here won
best in show.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.104
More like best
in the freak show.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.940
The sad part is, all
of the bulldog's problems
would be solved

06:46.974 --> 06:49.376
if breeders would just
allow them to crossbreed.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.244
But they won't,
because then they wouldn't

06:51.278 --> 06:52.780
look like bulldogs.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.282
But we decide
what bulldogs look like.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.750
Yeah, exactly.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.251
Our insistence
that these dogs

06:58.285 --> 07:00.387
live up to our
arbitrary standards

07:00.420 --> 07:02.990
is causing them
to get sick and die.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.792
As cute as you think
the bulldog is,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.393
the fact that
it exists at all

07:06.426 --> 07:08.462
is borderline
animal abuse.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.797
(dog whimpers)

07:09.830 --> 07:12.633
It's moments like this
I regret meeting you.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.001
(zap)

07:14.034 --> 07:17.437
So, all these dogs are bad,
and I shouldn't get one at all?

07:17.471 --> 07:18.472
Ugggh!

07:18.506 --> 07:19.907
No, of course you should.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.142
Just skip the breeder
and the pet store

07:22.175 --> 07:23.944
and head on down
to your local shelter

07:23.977 --> 07:25.479
to get a cute little mutt.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.481
It'll be 100%
all natural dog,

07:27.515 --> 07:29.650
and better yet, you'll be
giving a home to a pup

07:29.683 --> 07:30.818
that really needs one.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.821
Oh, that way,
I can adopt a pet

07:33.854 --> 07:35.188
and help an animal
in need.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.858
Helping animals
is what I'm all about.

07:37.891 --> 07:41.495
I even feed the stray cat that
lives under my deck, Mr. Bitey.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.297
Oh, feeding stray cats
doesn't help animals.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.365
In fact, it helps kill

07:45.398 --> 07:48.068
billions of animals
every year.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.604
Attack.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.239
(barking)

07:57.377 --> 08:00.147
Here's your almond milk,
Mr. Bitey.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.481
(cat hisses)

08:01.515 --> 08:03.884
(growling)

08:03.917 --> 08:07.020
Don't worry.
We'll change to soy.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.189
Oh, this
is a real problem.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.158
Yeah, I'm worried
he's lactose intolerant.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.960
No, I mean
the feral cat population

08:12.993 --> 08:16.029
has spiraled out of control,
and it's all our fault.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.898
Here, Mr. Bitey and I
will show you.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.466
(zap)

08:19.499 --> 08:21.869
(gasps)
Mr. Bitey's a lady?

08:21.902 --> 08:22.870
A lady actor.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.639
A Julliard-trained actor.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.307
The life of a cat is--

08:27.340 --> 08:28.542
Nope, no singing.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.543
Save it for
the Winter Garden Theatre.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.311
(hisses)

08:31.344 --> 08:34.481
There are over 70 million
pet cats in the U.S.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.183
We love 'em, we cuddle 'em,

08:36.216 --> 08:38.051
and we Snapchat
the hell out of 'em.

08:38.085 --> 08:41.822
Unfortunately, some people
also let those cats outside.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.893
Whoo! The man
finally let me out.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.327
'Sup, Mittens?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.328
Please.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.397
That's my
government name.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.599
Yeah, they're wild.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.900
They want to go outside.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.068
Yeah, that's
exactly the problem.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.871
Yeow!
I'm an outdoor cat now!

08:57.905 --> 08:59.740
I'm wild, baby.

08:59.773 --> 09:02.610
While they're outside,
those cats breed.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.379
Who's a feral boy?
You're a feral boy.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.248
(both moaning)

09:08.281 --> 09:10.217
(gasps)
Mr. Bitey, no!

09:10.250 --> 09:11.719
The average cat
can give birth

09:11.752 --> 09:13.921
to as many
as 12 kittens a year.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.422
Kittens! Oh...

09:15.455 --> 09:16.423
Uh...

09:16.456 --> 09:18.225
Oh...

09:18.258 --> 09:20.794
And their kittens
are born feral.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.596
Put all of that together...

09:22.630 --> 09:24.965
(drum roll)

09:24.998 --> 09:28.602
And there are now as many
as 70 million feral cats

09:28.636 --> 09:30.270
living in the U.S.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.305
(Veronica)
Eww!

09:32.339 --> 09:34.541
Basically, for every
pet cat living inside,

09:34.574 --> 09:37.778
there's a feral cat
living outside.

09:37.811 --> 09:42.916
We're an epidemic of
hiss-torical proportions.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.318
These cats live
tragically short lives.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.487
They suffer from disease,
they're hit by cars,

09:47.520 --> 09:50.257
and they get attacked by
animals, including other cats.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.925
You're a pussy!

09:51.959 --> 09:52.993
You're a pussy!

09:53.026 --> 09:53.994
(both screeching)

09:54.027 --> 09:55.796
It's okay
when they say it.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.898
But what's not okay
is that while indoor cats

09:57.931 --> 09:59.299
live about 15 years,

09:59.332 --> 10:01.802
the average outdoor cat
dies after just five.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.971
(gasps)
That's so sad.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.640
I didn't realize going outside
was so bad for cats.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.977
It is, but it's
even worse for birds.

10:10.010 --> 10:10.978
Hmm.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.512
(gasps)
I love little birdies!

10:12.545 --> 10:15.082
Yeah, so do cats.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.950
Mr. Bitey, no!

10:16.984 --> 10:19.753
But I just fed him...
slash-her.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.955
Cats kill birds whether
or not they're hungry,

10:21.989 --> 10:23.323
even if they've
just been fed.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.659
It's kind of just
what we do.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.194
(crunch)

10:27.227 --> 10:28.461
(crow cawing)

10:28.495 --> 10:29.863
A conservative estimate

10:29.897 --> 10:34.301
is that feral cats kill
1.3 billion birds a year.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.337
They've actually driven
20 bird species extinct.

Humans are the ones who
brought cats to this country

11:14.908 --> 11:16.376
and let them outside.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.878
There are even
entire groups of people

devoted to supporting
feral cat colonies.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.027
As well-intentioned
as these folks are,

11:34.061 --> 11:36.196
they're sustaining
a population of unhealthy,

11:36.229 --> 11:39.933
unhappy animals that kills
a billion birds a year.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.203
So what should we do?
Let 70 million cats die?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.739
Murder them all to death?
Of course not.

Look, I admit,
there is no easy solution

11:47.975 --> 11:49.242
to this problem.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.411
If you have a cat,
spay or neuter it,

11:51.444 --> 11:53.213
and please, keep it inside.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.681
That's at least a start.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.583
But meanwhile,
we need to face the fact

11:56.616 --> 11:58.919
that our love for animals,

11:58.952 --> 12:00.520

but he's not why these animals
are at risk of dying out.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.331
The real threats are loss
of habitat and poaching.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.866
We're a criminal cartel

13:52.900 --> 13:56.169
that systematically kills
thousands of animals a year.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.871
We cut off the horns
and tusks

13:57.905 --> 14:00.908
and sell them
to foreign businessmen.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.746

14:06.779 --> 14:09.149
Poachers are organized,
they're ruthless,

14:09.182 --> 14:11.818
and they are decimating
animal populations.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.987
In some countries,
rhino horn is believed

14:14.021 --> 14:16.589
to cure cancer
and even hangovers,

14:16.623 --> 14:19.759
and sells
for $28,000 a pound.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.694
That's more than gold
or cocaine.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.363
(sniffs)
Ahh.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.332

14:25.365 --> 14:27.100
Why don't
the locals stop them?

14:27.134 --> 14:30.170
Well, they're kinda busy,
you know, living their lives.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.339
Yeah, I got
a family to feed.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.342
Why should I waste time
protecting a frickin' lion?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.745
In his defense, I do eat
his livestock on the regs.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.881
Heck, sometimes
I attack adults and children.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.683
(gulp)
Hey!

14:43.716 --> 14:45.752
And just as harmful
to animal populations

14:45.785 --> 14:48.388
is the habitat loss
caused by farming.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.125
These animals are literally
running out of places to live.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.527
So, some African nations
came up with a plan.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.263
They took advantage
of the existing demand

14:56.296 --> 14:57.464
for trophy hunting...

14:57.497 --> 15:00.233
I would like to bazooka
one rhinoceros, please.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.302
...and used it to fund
animal conservation.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.205
Fine. There's an aggressive male
who's too old to breed,

15:05.238 --> 15:08.275
has attacked three people,
and killed five other rhinos.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.010
He's basically
an ass(bleep).

15:11.511 --> 15:14.381
You can shoot him
for... $350,000.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
Deal! This is what I choose
to spend my money on

15:16.449 --> 15:17.484
for some reason.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.751
Here's your receipt
and your

15:18.785 --> 15:21.754
"I'm a Rich Jerk Who
Shoots Rhinos" tote bag.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.424
What the hell?
He's gonna kill a rhino.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.726
Yes, but we're going
to use that money

15:26.759 --> 15:28.795
to save more rhinos.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.931
Say whaaaaat?!

15:31.965 --> 15:34.734
Yeah, in Namibia,
revenue from trophy hunting

15:34.767 --> 15:37.904
is the main way they fund
new wildlife conservancies.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.939
And in South Africa,
a portion of the proceeds

15:39.973 --> 15:41.975
from trophy hunting
is given directly

15:42.009 --> 15:44.677
to local land owners,
and that incentivizes them

15:44.711 --> 15:46.413
to give the rhinos
land to live on

15:46.446 --> 15:47.947
and to protect them
from poachers.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.517
Hey! Stay away
from those rhinos!

15:50.550 --> 15:52.619
They're worth more alive
than dead!

15:52.652 --> 15:55.922
Breed, my little
moneybags, breed.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.958
But he's keeping them alive
so they can be hunted!

15:58.992 --> 16:02.695
Absolutely true, but still,
this system works.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.198
One-third of all white rhinos
in South Africa

16:05.232 --> 16:06.866
now live on private land,

16:06.899 --> 16:09.302
and their population
has gone from just 100

16:09.336 --> 16:11.638
to more than 18,000.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.973
I'm so confused!

16:14.007 --> 16:16.043
You know ostriches don't
really do that, right?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.277
(muffled)
I don't care!

16:17.310 --> 16:18.711
It feels good.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.980
Veronica, I understand
that this is hard to believe.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.482
I had a tough time
with it, too.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.051
But then I talked
to Rosie Cooney,

16:24.084 --> 16:26.619
the chair of the Sustainable Use
and Livelihood Specialist Group

16:26.653 --> 16:29.389
of the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.890
Whew! Glad I got through
that whole title.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.359
It's true, Veronica.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.462
Trophy hunting can be a valuable
part of conservation efforts,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.897
even if you find hunting
distasteful.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.200
It's not the hunters
running these programs.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.634
It's the government agencies

16:41.668 --> 16:44.237
or sometimes even
conservation groups themselves.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.306
The hunters' motives
don't really matter.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.374
The money they generate

16:47.407 --> 16:49.076
can really help
the animals who need it.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.878
(Veronica)
But how do I know the money
is going to the right place?

16:51.911 --> 16:53.413
Well,
that's a good question.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.582
Like any program where
there's a lot of corruption

16:55.615 --> 16:57.384
or where things
are badly managed,

16:57.417 --> 16:59.352
these programs
don't work well at all.

16:59.386 --> 17:03.223
But that doesn't change the fact
that when they are well-managed,

17:03.256 --> 17:06.559
these programs can be a huge
help for wildlife conservation.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.027
In Namibia, for example,

17:08.061 --> 17:10.430
100% of the hunting
concession fees

17:10.463 --> 17:12.432
go straight
to the local communities.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.101
It's been a huge success.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.368
I don't know.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.003
I still think that we
should ban trophy hunting

17:17.036 --> 17:20.006
and find another way
to help these animals.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.175
Sorry, but that's
not a great idea.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.778
Many countries are depending on
this revenue to protect animals,

17:25.812 --> 17:28.581
to pay the game guards,
to buy the vehicles.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.450
What happens
if that money dries up?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.752
It's very easy for us
in the developed world

17:32.785 --> 17:35.955
to judge how other countries
should manage their animals,

17:35.988 --> 17:37.457
but should it be
our decision?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.126
Or should it be
up to the communities

17:39.159 --> 17:41.294
who live with these animals
every day?

17:41.328 --> 17:44.531
Hunting is a really important
source of conservation revenue,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.234
even where you are,
Veronica, in the U.S.

17:47.267 --> 17:50.403
Hunting fees generate around
$200 million a year,

17:50.437 --> 17:52.472
which for many states
is their primary source

17:52.505 --> 17:53.906
of conservation funding.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.476
If we banned
all trophy hunting everywhere,

17:56.509 --> 17:59.646
right now, it would do
way more harm than good.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.913
Bye, guys!

18:00.947 --> 18:03.383
Yeah, thank you!
Bye!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.385
Oh, man.
Fun way to travel.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.554
(rifle cocks,
gunshot)

18:07.587 --> 18:08.988
Okay, stop!

18:09.021 --> 18:10.323
I don't care
how much good it does,

18:10.357 --> 18:12.792
I hate that anyone would be
allowed to kill an animal!

18:12.825 --> 18:15.061
I just want to stop them
from suffering.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.864
Why is killing them
the only solution?

18:20.933 --> 18:21.968
I know it's hard.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.736
We love these animals
so much,

18:23.770 --> 18:26.306
we can't imagine any benefit
coming from their deaths.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.807
It just seems wrong.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.342
But you know what's worse
than one animal

18:29.376 --> 18:30.977
getting killed by a hunter?

18:31.010 --> 18:33.780
Hundreds of thousands
being wiped out by poaching

18:33.813 --> 18:35.448
and loss of habitat.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.317
The truth is,
in some nations,

18:37.350 --> 18:39.619
the regulated hunting
of a few individuals

18:39.652 --> 18:42.755
is helping to save
entire species.

18:42.789 --> 18:47.194
So, cute animals
have to die... to live?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.695
Well, I guess that's
one way of putting it.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.364
(ominous music)

18:51.398 --> 18:52.532
(gasping and whimpering)

18:54.066 --> 18:55.202
(shrieking)

18:57.304 --> 18:59.506
I'm doing this
for your own good.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.507
Uhh!

19:00.540 --> 19:01.874
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

19:01.908 --> 19:03.643
I'll tell you how
cuteness can help animals

19:03.676 --> 19:05.212
right after this.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.620
Fine!
Everything cute is bad.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.322
Puppies are
genetic monsters,

19:15.355 --> 19:17.123
kittens are bird slayers,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.125
and the only way to save
endangered species

19:19.158 --> 19:20.660
is to shoot them
in the face.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.362
I wanted to help
cute animals,

19:22.395 --> 19:24.697
but I guess
I'm just ruining everything!

19:24.731 --> 19:26.032
Oh, then you're
a lot like me.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.534
How dare you?

19:27.567 --> 19:30.670
Veronica, the fact
that you find animals so cute

19:30.703 --> 19:32.405
is a wonderful quality.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.673
It is?

19:33.706 --> 19:34.674
Of course.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.309
Cuteness is the emotion
that makes us

19:36.343 --> 19:38.177
want to nurture
and protect things,

19:38.211 --> 19:41.748
so we just need to expand
our notion of what we find cute.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.483
Like, instead of
genetically manipulating dogs

19:43.516 --> 19:44.651
for our own amusement,

19:44.684 --> 19:45.852
we should decide
that we find

19:45.885 --> 19:47.920
all shapes and sizes
of dog cute,

19:47.954 --> 19:50.089
and rescue mutts
from local shelters.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.358
(dog whimpering)

19:51.391 --> 19:53.025
Aww.
Yeah.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.394
And instead
of giving strays

19:54.427 --> 19:56.363
and feral cats
all the attention,

19:56.396 --> 19:59.366
we need to think more about
these adorable songbirds.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.534
They're cute, too,
and they need our help.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.503
I love his song.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.405
My favorite part
is the chirp.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.573
And you know what?

20:06.606 --> 20:09.576
Yeah, elephants, rhinos,
and lions need protection,

20:09.609 --> 20:12.779
but so do a lot of other,
less traditionally cute animals.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.881
For instance,
the critically endangered

20:14.914 --> 20:16.716
American burying beetle.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.385
They bury rodent carcasses
in the dirt

20:18.418 --> 20:19.586
and then lay
their eggs in them,

20:19.619 --> 20:21.020
which helps plants grow.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.722
That's not cute.

20:22.755 --> 20:23.890
Well, not to everybody,

20:23.923 --> 20:25.792
but if we decide they're
cute enough to save,

20:25.825 --> 20:28.761
we can help preserve an
important part of the ecosystem.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.531
So, tell you what,
let's cute-ify that beetle!

20:31.564 --> 20:33.600
Ohh, a plushie!

20:33.633 --> 20:34.967
Yeah.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.769
You can learn more about
these disgustingly adorable

20:36.803 --> 20:40.072
little guys
at SaveTheLittleBugs.org.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.541
You're right.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.909
If you look at it
the right way,

20:42.942 --> 20:45.111
even the most unattractive
thing can be cute.

20:45.144 --> 20:48.147
Funny, that's what my mom
always said growing up. Hmm.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.450
Well, I hope I didn't
ruin your dog day, Veronica.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.085
No... I know exactly
what dog I'm gonna get.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.987
♪♪

20:55.021 --> 20:57.657
I think
I'm gonna name you...

20:57.690 --> 20:59.792
Cutiepie.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.661
What do you think,
Mr. Bitey?

21:01.694 --> 21:04.764
I'm... not speaking
to you right now!

21:04.797 --> 21:05.832
Ooh!
