WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.330
- Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.330 --> 00:03.330
- You know Jessie Caine?
- Yeah, for a long time.

00:03.330 --> 00:04.880
- Nice to see you

00:04.880 --> 00:06.620
I'm playing at the Mercy Lounge

00:06.620 --> 00:08.040
Do you think that I invited
you to hear my songs

00:08.040 --> 00:09.920
so that I could insinuate
myself into your life.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.330
- No, no, I'm just trying
to be clear about me.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.080
- Okay, I'm gonna go

00:14.080 --> 00:15.750
Brand partnerships.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.710
The best kind of integration
is entirely frictionless.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.830
- Billy put together
a tour for me.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.120
- I don't want you to leave.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.380
- I need to do this
for myself now.

00:24.380 --> 00:27.000
- There's Flynn
- Do you still want my number?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.210
- Yeah, I want it.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.380
♪ I don't need a parachute
Baby if I've got you ♪

00:34.380 --> 00:35.920
♪ Baby if I've got you
I don't need... ♪

00:35.920 --> 00:38.960
- Daphne?
I'm leaving in five minutes

00:38.960 --> 00:40.000
if you still want that ride?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.960
- Okay.
- All right.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.540
(text message rings)

00:46.290 --> 00:50.790
♪ I don't need a parachute
Baby if I've got--♪

00:52.040 --> 00:54.460
(cell phone rings)

00:54.460 --> 00:55.580
- Hello?
- Deacon?

00:55.580 --> 00:57.460
It's Kristi Roberts
from FosterMore.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.420
- Oh, Kristi, hello.
Listen,

00:59.420 --> 01:01.420
thank you so much
for the help you're giving Liv.

01:01.420 --> 01:02.920
We appreciate it.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.460
- She's a real pistol,
isn't she?

01:04.460 --> 01:05.790
- (laughs)
She absolutely is that.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.500
- Well, I think we put her
in a real good home.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.290
- That is fantastic, I cannot
wait to tell the girls that.

01:10.290 --> 01:12.830
- Well, I'm so excited you're
playing our benefit tomorrow.

01:12.830 --> 01:14.500
You know, Rayna's support
meant the world to us.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.500
- Yeah, I do.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.460
That's why I'm happy to do it,
all right?

01:18.460 --> 01:20.500
- But we were hoping to have
your auction item in by now.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.460
- Kristi, I'm sorry.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.540
It just completely
slipped my mind.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.750
- Because normally we put it
in the program and...

01:27.750 --> 01:29.290
- Again, I'm sorry.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.420
It's been real hectic
around here, so...

01:30.420 --> 01:31.790
- Hey, I completely understand.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.420
Now it'll be something
she performed in, right?

01:34.420 --> 01:35.830
- Yeah, absolutely--I'll pick
some out right now, okay?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.460
I assume you want me
to just bring it.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.080
It's so late, right?
- That would be wonderful.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.540
- Okay, I'll do it, okay.
- Thank you.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.500
- I'm ready!
- Coming!

02:11.790 --> 02:14.250
- Oh, there she is.
Hey, what's up, baby girl?

02:14.250 --> 02:16.380
- Hey! Dude, I'm so happy
that you're doing this.

02:16.380 --> 02:17.380
I'm a huge fan.

02:17.380 --> 02:18.500
- Ditto.
Me too, darlin'.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.460
- What you did
with the choreography

02:20.460 --> 02:22.460
in Kesha's new video
was insane.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.540
- Oh, well, thank you.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.420
Can you please tell her that?

02:25.420 --> 02:26.790
She would love to hear it.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.330
Tonya, can I get a full
extension on that, please?

02:28.330 --> 02:29.750
Thank you, baby.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.380
- Is there anything I need
to know for tomorrow?

02:31.380 --> 02:32.960
- No, we'll make it
very user-friendly.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.500
- Well, don't make it
too user-friendly,

02:34.500 --> 02:36.540
I want to look good.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.500
- Yeah, well, I heard about
your injuries and all.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.170
I'm really sorry
about all of that.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.540
It must have been awful.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.420
- It's all in the past.
I'm 100%.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.460
- Well, okay, that's what's up.

02:45.460 --> 02:46.540
All right, well,
I'm looking forward to it.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.170
- You and me both.

02:48.170 --> 02:49.540
- All right, I'll see you soon,
sweetness.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.380
- Okay, bye.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.380
- Thanks for coming in, guys.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.500
Dan is aware
of all your concerns.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.620
That's why he wanted
to meet in person.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.290
- Yeah, we're just not
sure it's the best time

03:04.290 --> 03:05.920
to be shooting a commercial.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.880
- Yeah. I'd kind of rather
hide under a rock right now.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.040
- That actually would
make a great commercial.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.290
Remember, guys,

03:12.290 --> 03:13.500
we don't do commercials
like other people.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.620
Birch Tree Habitat

03:14.620 --> 03:16.290
is the Geico
of furniture companies.

03:16.290 --> 03:18.120
- Well, I love the one,
you know--the dogs are all

03:18.120 --> 03:20.120
sitting in the living room
drinking tea.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.290
The Corgi barks at her husband
for dropping the crumbs!

03:23.290 --> 03:24.460
It gets me everytime.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.290
- See?
Subvert the audience's idea

03:26.290 --> 03:27.380
of what a commercial should be.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.290
And just make it fun.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.710
Like in this case,
the joke is entirely on us.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.540
Let me ask you, what is
the first thing you think of

03:34.540 --> 03:36.290
when you think of
Birch Tree Habitat?

03:38.580 --> 03:40.880
Go ahead.
You can say it.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.830
- Your furniture is impossible
to put together.

03:42.830 --> 03:45.250
- Exactly.
But not anymore.

03:45.250 --> 03:48.250
We spent millions redesigning
our assembly procedure.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.880
So from now on, it's easy.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.250
- Well, okay.
Um, well...

03:52.250 --> 03:54.250
Where do we fit in to that?

03:54.250 --> 03:55.920
- The two of you are
standing in a room.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.250
We hear one of your
amazing songs.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.920
A voice says, "The Exes.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.000
Country music's favorite
on-again, off-again couple."

04:02.000 --> 04:04.290
An unopened box gets
brought into the room.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.250
And we see you
in sped-up motion

04:06.250 --> 04:09.210
easily assemble this
brand new dining room table.

04:09.210 --> 04:10.790
When you're finished,
you lean up against it.

04:10.790 --> 04:12.500
And you're very proud
of your work.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.210
And the voice says,
"Life is complicated.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.790
Putting our furniture together
doesn't have to be."

04:17.790 --> 04:19.210
- That is great.

04:19.210 --> 04:22.500
- You see, our demographic
is over 50% millennials.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.620
And they get that life
is complicated.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.330
It's hard to have a career.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.880
It's hard to believe
in the future.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.670
It's hard to have
a relationship.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.620
And right now, guys, honestly,
you represent that perfectly.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.210
We show that Birch Tree Habitat

04:35.210 --> 04:37.120
will be there through all
of their complications.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.250
Thoughts?

04:43.380 --> 04:45.120
- Hey.
- Well, hey.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.580
Aren't you about ready
to leave town?

04:46.580 --> 04:48.000
Go on the road?
- Yeah...

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Just wanted to stop by
and say goodbye.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.750
And I'm sorry for the way things
ended with Hallie.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.620
- Oh, don't be.
We got that handled.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.170
Charlie's gonna produce this.
It'll be fine.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.460
- Yeah, he'll do a great job.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.460
It honestly doesn't take much to
make her sound good.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.750
- That's true.
You excited about the tour?

05:04.750 --> 05:07.000
- I should be.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.920
It's just--it's different
when you have a kid, you know.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.170
- Yeah.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.580
- She said her first sentence
the other day.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.460
- She did really?
What'd she say?

05:14.460 --> 05:17.460
- Give me milk.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.170
- Looks like you
got you a genius.

05:19.170 --> 05:23.120
- Yeah, she's got her first big
girl bed coming next week.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.790
There's just so many firsts.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.420
And I don't want
to miss any of them.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.500
How you holding up, man?

05:30.500 --> 05:34.170
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I can tell.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.580
- I'm doing this benefit
tomorrow night for this charity.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.750
It meant a whole lot to Rayna.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.420
And they asked me
for some auction item

05:46.420 --> 05:49.500
they could make
some more money on, and uh...

05:49.500 --> 05:52.040
Should be this
simple deal, but...

05:52.040 --> 05:54.710
got me all jacked up.
You know, no reason.

05:54.710 --> 05:57.040
- Yeah, I don't think
it's over nothing.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.830
- It's been a while just,
you know, I keep thinking.

05:58.830 --> 06:01.040
Maybe I should be a little
further along by now, you know.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.670
- Yeah. I'm not sure you could
put a timeline on grief.

06:04.670 --> 06:06.710
- I know.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.670
What am I
supposed to do, though?

06:08.670 --> 06:10.380
I'm gonna lock myself
in the house?

06:10.380 --> 06:12.710
Build a shrine to her?
It just sounds so stupid.

06:12.710 --> 06:15.080
She'd be the first one
to say so too, she would.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.960
- Listen, Deacon.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.080
I-I can't imagine what
you're going through.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.620
I really can't,

06:22.620 --> 06:27.420
but at the end of the day,
what's on these walls,

06:27.420 --> 06:29.080
what's in her closet?

06:29.080 --> 06:32.040
It's just stuff, right?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.080
I mean, the life
that you shared.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.460
The music
you wrote together.

06:35.460 --> 06:39.250
Now that,
that's a different story.

06:39.250 --> 06:43.040
Nobody can take that away.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.460
That stuff's eternal.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.460
- You're gonna be a good dad.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.040
Go get 'em!

07:15.830 --> 07:17.580
- So what is this benefit
you're playing?

07:17.580 --> 07:19.750
- Uh, FosterMore, the charity
your mom used to work with.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.080
Hey, you wanna go?

07:21.080 --> 07:22.880
- Oh, I can't.
My friend wants me

07:22.880 --> 07:25.500
to play this live
podcast thing she's in.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.120
To help promote the EP.
Is that cool?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.670
- Of course, it is.
I'll bring Daphne.

07:28.670 --> 07:30.080
- Bring Daphne where?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.710
- Uh, the FosterMore event.
It's tonight.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.080
- I did that last year.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.040
- I know.
What?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.620
- Um, I was invited to a party
at Rebecca's house.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.080
- Oh, what kind of party?

07:41.080 --> 07:43.960
- It's like a bunch of kids just
watching a scary movie.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.080
- Mm-hmm.
Mom and dad gonna be there?

07:45.080 --> 07:47.620
- Of course.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.830
- Okay. You can go.

07:49.830 --> 07:52.620
All right, I gotta
get going myself.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.620
Oh, listen...

07:54.620 --> 07:56.290
I wanted to run
something by you guys.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.960
Kristi from FosterMore
wanted to know

07:57.960 --> 07:59.710
if we could donate some item
of clothing of Mom's

07:59.710 --> 08:01.040
that they could auction off.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.920
- You wanna give
something of Mom's away?

08:02.920 --> 08:04.670
- Well, yeah.
- Like from her closet?

08:04.670 --> 08:06.290
- What? No.
How could you do that?

08:06.290 --> 08:08.170
- I'm sorry. I...
- Those are her things!

08:08.170 --> 08:10.420
- I didn't know it would
upset you guys so much.

08:10.420 --> 08:13.210
- Yeah, actually, it does.
- Like it upsets me a lot.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.500
- Okay, I get that.
I understand.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.250
I won't do it.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.960
I'm putting it back right away.
Back to the closet it goes.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.580
- Wait, that's what
you want to donate?

08:20.580 --> 08:22.120
- Yeah.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.420
- That's fine.
I hate that thing.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.580
- Yeah, it's terrible.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.880
We always told her
not to wear it.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.880
- You sure?
- Yes.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.420
- It's ugly.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.170
The flowers are dorky.

08:33.170 --> 08:35.960
- (chuckles)

08:38.500 --> 08:41.420
- Our daughter just said,
"I love rabbit."

08:41.420 --> 08:42.540
- What?
- Yes!

08:42.540 --> 08:43.920
She picked it up and hugged it.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.880
And the words just came out.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.580
- I told you the kid's a genius.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.380
- How am I supposed
to leave now?

08:49.380 --> 08:51.380
- Hey, the first leg
is only two weeks...

08:51.380 --> 08:53.580
- Two weeks? She could be
doing calculus in two weeks.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.120
- I hope not.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.170
- Promise me you won't
let her do anything new

08:57.170 --> 08:59.830
while I'm gone, okay?
And if she does,

08:59.830 --> 09:02.080
I want it recorded
from multiple angles.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.580
- Okay, as long as you promise

09:03.580 --> 09:05.250
to stay on the straight
and narrow.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.830
- My God, you're confusing me
with my younger self.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.120
- The tour's gonna go great.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.080
I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.500
I'm gonna go load the car.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.380
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.670
- (sighs)

09:21.120 --> 09:23.120
- Alyssa says this
could run for months.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.540
And if they like it,
they might have us do another.

09:24.540 --> 09:26.330
- So we do more of these?

09:26.330 --> 09:28.500
- Well, if that's what it takes
to get a record out there.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.620
- I never thought I'd be
writing jingles for a living.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.170
- All right, come on.
It's our own song.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.120
Millions of people are
gonna hear it over and over.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.120
- And think of furniture.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.330
- Hey, you guys ready
to rock this thing?

- What's up?
- You tell me.

09:55.460 --> 09:56.920
- I'm fine.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.460
- Yeah, well,
it doesn't look like it.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.080
- I'm just rusty.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.460
Just give me a couple
of rehearsals--I'll be fine.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.170
- Look, baby, I don't
want you to hurt yourself.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.460
- I'm not gonna hurt myself.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.500
- Look, you survived
a plane crash.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.330
I'm surprised you're strutting
around here as well as you are.

10:09.330 --> 10:12.210
Come on, let me make it
a little easier for you.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.670
Let the kids do all
the heavy lifting, huh?

10:14.670 --> 10:16.880
All you need to do is stand here
and look pretty.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.580
- You know what, how about
we don't make it easier?

10:21.580 --> 10:24.540
- Yeah...
- I got this.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.080
- All right.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.620
All right, people,
let's start from the top.

10:28.620 --> 10:31.830
You heard the lady.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.290
- If you'll sign right here,

10:37.290 --> 10:39.040
I'll have someone take your bags
to your room for you.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.250
- All right. Is there someplace
I can get a drink around here?

10:41.250 --> 10:43.290
- Yeah, the bar's
right over there.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.710
- Okay, thanks.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.250
- My first customer.
- I'll try not to be too taxing.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.420
- Manhattan with a twist, very
dry with a splash of vermouth?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.830
- Um, I'll just have a Coke.

10:55.830 --> 10:59.380
- My kind of man.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.750
You in town for work?

11:00.750 --> 11:03.000
- Sort of.
- That's cryptic.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.210
CIA?

11:05.210 --> 11:06.750
- If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.670
- Seriously...
(chuckles)

11:09.670 --> 11:11.380
You're not a food critic,
are you?

11:11.380 --> 11:13.210
Because our chef is on vacation.

11:13.210 --> 11:16.380
- No. My band's opening
for Dierks Bentley tonight.

11:16.380 --> 11:19.580
- No way.
I love Dierks Bentley!

11:19.580 --> 11:20.750
All my friends are going.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.670
- Yeah? Well, why aren't you?

11:22.670 --> 11:24.540
- Because I'm stuck here
serving people like you.

11:24.540 --> 11:27.290
Except...you're not
gonna be here

11:27.290 --> 11:31.000
because you're opening
for Dierks Bentley!

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Bastard!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.170
I'm Nell, by the way.
- Avery.

11:36.170 --> 11:38.710
- I'll forgive you if you
bring me back a t-shirt.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.790
- Can you make
my eyes look smokey?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.000
- Uh, not for another
year or two.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.250
But I can make your
cheeks rosier.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.960
- Okay, anything.
Just do it.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.120
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not nervous.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.960
Do I look nervous?
- Yes.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.880
- Maddie, there's gonna be
a lot of eighth graders there.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.170
- Eighth graders are just
like seventh graders,

11:59.170 --> 12:00.290
only a little older.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.920
- That's why I'm nervous.

12:02.920 --> 12:03.960
- You already look a year older.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.330
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.880
Just be yourself.
It'll be great.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.580
- Zach sends his regards from
Richard Branson's island.

12:14.580 --> 12:15.620
- Well, I want his life.
(chuckles)

12:15.620 --> 12:16.960
- You guys look adorable.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.080
I'm so glad you
decided to do this.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.750
- Well, I'm pretty sure

12:19.750 --> 12:21.290
we're gonna screw
this thingy up, but...

12:21.290 --> 12:23.500
- Guys, you look great.
We'll see you out there.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.960
- Thanks.
What's his name again?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.750
- Dan.
- Why are there so many of them?

12:26.750 --> 12:28.500
- Well, they're all afraid to
have their own opinions.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.580
- So this is it, guys.
Everybody feeling good?

12:30.580 --> 12:32.880
- Good enough.
- All right, then.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.710
- I'm sorry, I thought, uh,

12:37.710 --> 12:41.790
we were assembling
a table, right?

12:41.790 --> 12:43.500
- Well, we thought,
what the hell?

12:43.500 --> 12:45.880
Since you're pregnant,
why not do a crib instead?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.710
It's all right, isn't it?

that I can't do this!

14:43.670 --> 14:47.120
I should have rehabbed
it harder, worked harder...

14:47.120 --> 14:50.710
- No, see, I'm guessing
that you killed it in rehab.

14:50.710 --> 14:52.290
That's where you
injured yourself.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.750
Because you were
working so hard.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.040
You know, baby,

14:57.040 --> 14:59.750
back in the day
when I was younger,

14:59.750 --> 15:01.170
I used to dance
with Alvin Ailey.

15:01.170 --> 15:03.960
Old man could do
30 pirouettes in a row.

15:03.960 --> 15:04.830
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

15:04.830 --> 15:07.750
He couldn't tell me nothing.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.750
But guess how many I can do now?

15:10.750 --> 15:15.380
Three.
And that's on a good day.

15:15.380 --> 15:19.420
Arthritis so bad, I can't even
stand on the ball of that foot.

15:19.420 --> 15:24.120
Baby, being human is a bitch.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.120
Took me a long time

15:27.120 --> 15:29.960
to let go of who
I thought I should be.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.750
And find out who I really was.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.620
Now, you can still dance.

15:38.620 --> 15:42.750
You just have to do it
the way you can do it now.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.880
Not how you used to
do it a year ago.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.960
And forgive yourself.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.750
All right, come on,
let's get up off this floor.

15:53.750 --> 15:54.830
We got work to do.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.920
- There he is!

16:02.920 --> 16:04.880
- Hello, Kristi.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.040
- So good to see you.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.880
- As promised.
- Thank you so much.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.920
- My girls were a little
reluctant to part with it.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.080
I had to twist their arms.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.040
- It's beautiful.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.790
- So who am I embarrassing
myself with tonight?

16:17.790 --> 16:19.880
- You are the star attraction.
You and Martina...

16:19.880 --> 16:21.120
- Oh, yeah, I'm the star.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.250
- And Lady Antebellum.
- Never heard of her.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.920
- And someone you might
remember, Jessie Caine.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.330
- She's fantastic.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.960
- I know. I just heard
her sound check.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.120
And I'd better get this
over to the auction people.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.830
I think they're ready
for your sound check now.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.290
- Thank you.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.750
- Hey!
- Hey.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.920
- I don't hear anything.
Are we early?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.210
- I don't know.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.920
Where is everybody?

16:56.920 --> 16:58.880
- I don't know.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.670
It was supposed to be
a huge party.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.750
You want a soda?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

17:09.830 --> 17:11.540
- Is he your boyfriend?
- What?

17:11.540 --> 17:14.750
- He's cute. Kinda little.
Mine's on his way.

17:17.790 --> 17:18.830
- Where's everybody else?

17:18.830 --> 17:22.790
- Why would you want
anybody else?

17:22.790 --> 17:24.380
- Thanks.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.120
- Finally!
- They left? All right!

17:28.120 --> 17:29.880
- Who left?
- Rebecca's parents.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.880
They were supposed to
leave like an hour ago.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.920
- I told my dad
they were gonna be here.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.830
- Me too.

17:36.830 --> 17:39.750

18:11.330 --> 18:12.830

to hit the black!

18:12.830 --> 18:14.420
- Incorrect!

18:14.420 --> 18:16.330
Is he correct?

18:16.330 --> 18:18.540
Okay, that was a pilot error.

18:18.540 --> 18:21.620

18:21.620 --> 18:23.330

Thank God you're here.
Listen, we need you.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.460
We need more beers.
We need wings!

18:26.460 --> 18:27.920
- Okay, you're cut off.

18:27.920 --> 18:29.540
- Huh?
- No more wings for you.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.380
(cell phone rings)

18:32.380 --> 18:35.000
- Hi baby! I miss you!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.790
- What?

18:36.790 --> 18:40.250
- I said I miss you!
- I miss you too.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.380
How was tonight?

18:41.380 --> 18:44.620
- Oh, we killed!
We murdered!

18:44.620 --> 18:46.170
I mean, you should
have been there!

18:46.170 --> 18:48.330
- I wish I was.

18:48.330 --> 18:49.750
- What?

18:49.750 --> 18:52.880
- Can you go somewhere
quieter so we can talk?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.380
It's been a little bit
of a rough day.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.620
- I can't hear you.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.210
- Whoever this is,

18:59.210 --> 19:00.960
you're infringing on
Avery's drinking time.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.750
So maybe you should
just let him--

19:04.750 --> 19:07.960
- Uh, sorry about that.
Geez.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.750
- Who was that?
- That was the bartender.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.580
I can't believe
she just said that.

19:13.580 --> 19:16.290
But, anyway, what's up, hon?
Talk to me.

19:16.290 --> 19:18.210
- You know what?
It's all good.

19:18.210 --> 19:20.170
Just call me when you get
back to the room, okay?

19:20.170 --> 19:23.120
- No, no, no--I can talk now.
I can hear you.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.420
- You're out with your friends.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.710
Just call me later.

19:40.330 --> 19:42.080
- What happened to the movie?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.290
- I know.
It's one of my favorites too.

19:44.290 --> 19:46.170
- "Night of the Living Dead"?

19:46.170 --> 19:47.580
- Yeah, it's a total classic.

19:47.580 --> 19:48.750
It's one of the best
apocalyptic films ever.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.290
Good as "Dawn of the Dead"

19:50.290 --> 19:51.960
or the original
"Planet of the Apes".

19:51.960 --> 19:53.580
- What's it about?

19:53.580 --> 19:54.920
- A guy and a girl get
trapped in a house

19:54.920 --> 19:57.420
with a bunch of zombies.

19:57.420 --> 20:00.790
- You mean, like this?
- Exactly. (laughs)

20:00.790 --> 20:03.580
- How do you become
a zombie anyways?

20:03.580 --> 20:06.500
- You get bitten
by a dead person.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.330
- I don't feel very good.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.380
- Jessie.
- Deacon.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.040
- Glad to hear you're
playing tonight.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.040
- I wasn't when I heard who else
is gonna be up there.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.170
That's some tall cotton.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.380
- They're lucky to have you.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.250
- Thank you.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.620
- Guess I'm here.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.380
- What's the matter?

21:47.380 --> 21:49.380
- I just don't think
I can do it.

21:49.380 --> 21:51.880
- Just take it easy.
You're gonna be all right.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.920
- It's okay. It's alright.

21:59.710 --> 22:02.040
- Hey. How are you doing?
Think you can make it?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.920
- I can't do this--I should
never have agreed to it.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.460
- You're gonna be fine.
Just give it a minute.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.080
- Nobody's rushing you.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.080
- Alyssa, I really don't think
I can do this. I'm sorry.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.080
- We're right
in the middle of it.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.460
- Well, they said
it would be a table.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.460
Why is it a crib?
They said it was a table.

22:14.460 --> 22:15.710
- Okay, you know what?

22:15.710 --> 22:17.460
You want me to ask
if it can be a table?

22:17.460 --> 22:20.460
- Please, yes.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.040
- I don't understand why
the crib's such a big deal.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.580
- Because my baby's
not even born yet.

22:23.580 --> 22:24.880
And we're already
pimping her out

22:24.880 --> 22:26.290
for some more
Instagram followers.

22:26.290 --> 22:27.540
- Scarlett,
it's just a commercial.

22:27.540 --> 22:30.670
- It feels really wrong.

22:30.670 --> 22:32.830
- Okay, so I talked
to the director.

22:32.830 --> 22:34.830
And he said that we
only have an hour left.

22:34.830 --> 22:37.000
So there's not enough time to
start over again with a table.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.460
I'm really sorry.

22:38.460 --> 22:41.420
- No, it's fine.
You tell him to start.

22:44.540 --> 22:47.790
- She's never gonna match.
And she looks miserable.

22:47.790 --> 22:50.250
- What are we gonna do?
- I still need a close-up.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.540
Let's just set up
and hope she calms down.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.750
- This has never
happened to me before.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.920
- Never a dull moment
in the ad world.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.750
- Oh, and it's one bark
when he wants to go out.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.290
And two when he wants to eat.

23:02.290 --> 23:04.880
Oh, he gets so mad when I'm sad.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.120
Martha, why are you crying?
You, cut that out!

23:08.120 --> 23:10.750
(laughs)
You have a dog?

23:10.750 --> 23:13.670
- I had a lab named, um...

23:13.670 --> 23:15.920
it's a long story.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.960
- Well, look who's
on the bill tonight.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.290
- Hello, Brad.

23:19.290 --> 23:21.250
- If I had known, I would
have brought Jake along.

23:21.250 --> 23:23.620
He'd love to see him mom play.
- Well, maybe next time.

23:23.620 --> 23:25.250
- Well, he couldn't come anyway.
He's grounded.

23:25.250 --> 23:26.830
- Again?

23:26.830 --> 23:28.000
- Well, he knows the rules,
you know.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.830
Do your homework
or pay the consequences.

23:29.830 --> 23:31.880
- Oh, it's not that simple...
He has processing issues--

23:31.880 --> 23:34.290
- Oh, my goodness.
He's got motivation issues.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.880
And we're getting him past that.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.290
Well, hey, there,
Deacon Claybourne, media tycoon.

23:39.290 --> 23:41.210
- Hello.
How you doing?

23:41.210 --> 23:43.120
- I'm hearing great things about
that boy genius of yours, huh?

23:43.120 --> 23:44.290
Might even turn a profit.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.830
- You know, anything can happen.

23:45.830 --> 23:47.710
- Yeah. You're gonna be
coming after me soon.

23:47.710 --> 23:49.460
I better watch out.
Unfriendly takeover

23:49.460 --> 23:50.830
of Shiny New Records, huh?

23:50.830 --> 23:52.250
- Completely friendly takeover.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.250
- (laughs) Bring it, boy.
I love a good fight.

23:54.250 --> 23:58.540
I think we both know who'd
win that one, huh, right?

23:58.540 --> 24:00.500
Hey, y'all are in
for a treat tonight.

24:00.500 --> 24:04.330
I discovered this woman.
What a rare treat she is.

24:05.830 --> 24:07.790
Y'all enjoy your evening.
- Thank you.

24:17.830 --> 24:19.040
- You okay?

24:19.040 --> 24:21.210
- Yeah.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.290
I just thought tonight was gonna
be something a little different.

24:23.290 --> 24:26.040
- So pissed at Chad right now.

24:26.040 --> 24:30.580
All this so that he can make out
with Rebecca Carton.

24:30.580 --> 24:32.040
It's much nicer out here.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.170
- Yeah.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.210
(bird chirps)

24:35.210 --> 24:37.170
- Isn't that cool?

24:37.170 --> 24:40.000
- I didn't know
birds sang at night.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.750
- They don't usually.

24:42.750 --> 24:47.620
Could be a Whippoorwill,
a Mockingbird.

24:47.620 --> 24:51.380
Or a Mockingbird pretending
to be a Whippoorwill.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.210
- How do you know
so much about birds?

24:53.210 --> 24:55.000
- I just read.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.710
I was a dinosaur freak
when I was younger.

24:58.710 --> 25:00.830
I just like anything
about the natural world.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.330
- Cool.

25:02.330 --> 25:05.960
- A human world
is a little more confusing.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.250
- (laughs)

25:10.120 --> 25:12.210
I'm sorry about tonight.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.420
- It's okay.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.120
- I didn't want you to think

25:15.120 --> 25:16.960
that's why I invited you.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.750
I mean, I would have
invited you if I thought...

25:20.750 --> 25:22.790
I mean, I would never assume,
of course, but,

25:22.790 --> 25:24.830
I didn't want you
to think I hadn't...

25:26.790 --> 25:28.960
I'm just making things worse,
aren't I?

25:28.960 --> 25:32.460
- No, it's okay.
I feel the same way.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.170
- (sighs)

25:36.170 --> 25:39.750
Who knew parties
could be so stressful?

25:39.750 --> 25:42.710
If this is what
eighth grade is like,

25:42.710 --> 25:45.380
I think I'll try
and be held back.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.920
- Same here.

25:56.790 --> 25:59.080
- Don't ask for another.
We already closed.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.750
- I should go anyway.

26:01.750 --> 26:05.290
Hey, who do I call
if my TV's not working?

26:05.290 --> 26:07.380
- The front desk.
They'll send up Yuri...

26:07.380 --> 26:08.880
(text message rings)

26:08.880 --> 26:10.880
Who won't know how to fix it.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.250
- Thank you.
- Wife or girlfriend?

26:15.250 --> 26:18.170
- Huh? Oh, uh...

26:18.170 --> 26:20.040
it's complicated.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.960
- Who is raining on your parade?

26:22.960 --> 26:27.500
- Rain isn't exactly
the word I would use.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.620
It's more like a hurricane.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.620
Crashing waves and howling wind.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.620
And destruction everywhere.

26:34.620 --> 26:37.670
And then, all of a sudden,
peace.

26:37.670 --> 26:39.040
At least for a while.

26:39.040 --> 26:44.000
- And if she's a hurricane,
what are you?

26:44.000 --> 26:47.540
- I am the calm in the middle.

26:47.540 --> 26:52.000
I mean, I follow behind her,
and pick up the pieces.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.620
- Not much fun.

26:54.620 --> 26:57.830
- That's probably why I'm here.

26:57.830 --> 27:00.670
On tour, that is.

27:00.670 --> 27:04.670
Not here. Not in this hotel.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.880
- I'm pretty sure
I can fix your TV.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.540
- You're home early.
How was the party?

27:18.540 --> 27:20.000
- Horrible beyond belief.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.420
- What?
What happened?

27:22.420 --> 27:24.000
- There was only like
eight people there.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.830
And then it turned out to be
this weird make-out orgy.

27:30.290 --> 27:31.790
- Oh, my God.
Did you make out with Flynn?

27:31.790 --> 27:34.380
- No! Oh, my...

27:34.380 --> 27:36.790
I was totally grossed out.
So I just went outside.

27:36.790 --> 27:39.790
- Good for you.
What did he do?

27:39.790 --> 27:41.960
- He came out too.
He probably felt the same way.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.170
- And?
- And nothing.

27:45.170 --> 27:49.500
We just talked about
all kinds of stuff.

27:49.500 --> 27:53.880
Birds,..
He's pretty cool.

27:53.880 --> 27:54.920
- And then you kissed?

27:54.920 --> 27:59.500
- No!
No, of course not. I...

28:01.830 --> 28:03.750
I kind of wanted to.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.620
- All right.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.830
- But at the same time,
I really didn't.

28:08.830 --> 28:09.960
- Yeah, it's okay.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.670
You just weren't ready,
that's all.

28:13.540 --> 28:15.040
How do you know
when you're ready?

28:15.040 --> 28:18.750
- Well, Mom says
you just kind of know.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.210
That's what happened for me.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.580
(text message rings)

28:37.710 --> 28:39.960
- Okay, y'all!
We are not done yet!

28:39.960 --> 28:42.710
We have one more item
to auction off.

28:42.710 --> 28:44.880
And let me tell you, we have
saved the best for last.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.710
Let's bring it out.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.460
Now this was worn by
the Queen of Country herself.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.000
The late, great Rayna James.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.710
Isn't that absolutely beautiful?

28:53.710 --> 28:55.540
Now through your generosity,

28:55.540 --> 28:57.920
tonight we're gonna be helping
children get off the streets.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.830
So I'm gonna help you get your
checkbook out of your pockets.

29:00.830 --> 29:02.290
And we're gonna start
the bidding at $5,000.

29:02.290 --> 29:03.830
Somebody give me $5,000.

29:03.830 --> 29:06.170
I got $5,000 from that gentleman
right over there now.

29:06.170 --> 29:07.880
Now, sir, are you gonna be
wearing that yourself?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.000
- I know my wife will.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.710
- I bet you're a smart man too.

29:10.710 --> 29:11.960
Because you know what they say,
right, everybody?

29:11.960 --> 29:13.290
Happy wife, happy life.

29:13.290 --> 29:15.250
All right,
somebody give me $7,500.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.880
Looking for $7,500 out there!
I need--

29:16.880 --> 29:18.750
- $10,000!

29:18.750 --> 29:20.710
- I got $10,000 from that
young lady right there. Yes!

29:20.710 --> 29:22.830
Somebody say 15?
I need $15,000 out there.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.830
- 15!
- I got $15,000!

29:24.830 --> 29:26.670
That's what I want to see!

29:26.670 --> 29:28.880
A bidding war for this gorgeous
piece of history right here.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.250
Come on now.
$20,000.

29:30.250 --> 29:31.920
We are talking about
the Queen of Country right here.

29:31.920 --> 29:35.380
Now who would not want
a piece of that legacy?

29:35.380 --> 29:37.380
- $25,000.
- $25,000?

29:37.380 --> 29:38.880
I love it and she's
bidding against herself!

29:38.880 --> 29:40.750
That's what I like to see!

29:40.750 --> 29:43.460
But, sir, you are not gonna let
her get away with that, are you?

29:43.460 --> 29:46.000
Come on now.
You know what comes after $25.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.420
Say it with me.
Come on.

29:47.420 --> 29:49.880
- $30.
- I got $30,000 over here!

29:49.880 --> 29:50.790
- 35.
- 35!

29:50.790 --> 29:52.000
- 40.
- 40!

29:52.000 --> 29:53.250
It's getting
ridiculous out here.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.620
And I absolutely love it!

29:55.620 --> 29:57.880
This is great, but you know
what, ladies and gentlemen?

29:57.880 --> 30:00.330
I think it's time to separate
the ladies from the boys.

30:00.330 --> 30:01.880
And I'm gonna do it right here.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.750
50 grand for that treasure
right there.

30:03.750 --> 30:05.750
Somebody's good for it.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.080
How about my little
lady right here?

30:07.080 --> 30:09.040
- I love her.
I really do...

30:09.040 --> 30:12.460
- But not that much?
(laughter)

30:12.460 --> 30:13.830
- My husband's
gonna kill me as it is.

30:13.830 --> 30:17.040
- Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.960
Looks like we know who's not
getting any tonight.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.750
- 50 grand!
- That's what I thought!

30:21.750 --> 30:24.040
$50,000!
Thank you so much! Yeah!

30:34.920 --> 30:36.290
- Alyssa says
they're gonna try

30:36.290 --> 30:39.170
to cut together
what they got, so...

30:39.170 --> 30:40.670
- Don't feel bad.

30:40.670 --> 30:44.500
- I can't help it.
I knew it was a mistake.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.290
Would you mind stopping?
We're out of milk.

30:47.290 --> 30:48.960
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.620
- (sighs)

30:55.620 --> 30:57.290
- I don't feel like I really
want to talk right now, Jes--

31:02.880 --> 31:04.880
- Sorry.
Did you say something?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.540
- No.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.830
- And a good time
was had by all, huh?

31:13.830 --> 31:17.790
- Yeah, it's time like these
I really wish I still smoked.

31:17.790 --> 31:19.380
Or had a gun.

31:22.710 --> 31:23.790
- He's quite a charming fellow--

31:23.790 --> 31:27.790
- You don't need to talk to me.

31:27.790 --> 31:30.670
I get why you're out here.

31:30.670 --> 31:32.380
- All for a good cause, I guess.

31:32.380 --> 31:34.670
- Yeah, well,
I'm sure it doesn't...

31:34.670 --> 31:38.500
make it hurt any less.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.210
- You know, some days it's like
I can barely stand to be seen.

31:41.210 --> 31:45.830
- That's been my life
for the last four years.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.790
- At least you're free
of him now, huh?

31:47.790 --> 31:49.670
- You think this is about Brad?

31:49.670 --> 31:52.080
This isn't about Brad.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.580
I'd be happy
to never think about him

31:54.580 --> 31:58.620
for as long as I live.

31:58.620 --> 32:01.380
It's about our son who...

32:06.750 --> 32:08.750
he's killing day by day.

32:08.750 --> 32:12.210
Cruelty by cruelty. Just...

32:12.210 --> 32:14.790
killing his beautiful spirit.

32:14.790 --> 32:17.210
- There's nothing
you can do about it?

32:17.210 --> 32:19.750
- You really don't listen
to gossip, do you?

32:19.750 --> 32:23.330
The, to fill you in,
I'm an unfit mother

32:23.330 --> 32:26.580
who is prone
to irrational behavior,

32:26.580 --> 32:29.080
and uncontrollable rage.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.040
And it's got to be true, right?

32:31.040 --> 32:33.460
Because our nanny said it.

32:33.460 --> 32:36.170
And his assistant said it.
And my ex-best friend said it.

32:36.170 --> 32:38.710
And the fact that he
employs all of them

32:38.710 --> 32:41.750
would never come into play.
Right? Of course not.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.880
- Sorry, Jessie.

32:47.170 --> 32:49.290
- You know,
I would never presume

32:49.290 --> 32:52.880
to know your pain, because,

32:52.880 --> 32:56.830
honestly, I've never
had a love like that.

32:56.830 --> 33:00.710
But I'm watching
somebody that I love...

33:00.710 --> 33:03.000
die in slow motion.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.330
And I would do anything
for that boy.

33:07.330 --> 33:10.710
I'm sorry--This is
the last thing you needed.

33:10.710 --> 33:13.790
- It's okay.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.580
- You're up next,
Mr. Claybourne.

33:17.580 --> 33:18.830
- Yeah, I'm coming.

33:23.580 --> 33:24.670
Listen, Jessie...

33:24.670 --> 33:25.670
- You don't need
to say anything.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.330
I intruded on your solitude.

33:27.330 --> 33:29.460
And I'm sorry, I really am.
- No, it's just--

33:29.460 --> 33:31.460
I think it's all
gonna be all right.

33:31.460 --> 33:34.210
I think...I do.
I think you're tough.

33:34.210 --> 33:36.620
I think you're gonna prevail.

33:36.620 --> 33:38.040
- You think I'm tough?

33:38.040 --> 33:42.670
- Yeah.
Ask the trashcans.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.250
- Sing well.

33:48.250 --> 33:49.790
- You too.

33:58.790 --> 34:03.580
(cell phone rings)

34:03.580 --> 34:06.420
- Excuse me just one second.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.880
Hey.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.580
- Why didn't you text me back?

34:10.580 --> 34:12.880
- I just got to the room.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.750
- Why are you whispering?

34:14.750 --> 34:16.420
- I'm not whispering.

34:16.420 --> 34:19.580
How was your day?
Was Anton nice?

34:19.580 --> 34:21.580
- Are you alone?

34:21.580 --> 34:22.580
- Of course, I'm alone.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.750
It's the middle of the night.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.290
I want to know
how your day went.

34:26.290 --> 34:27.620
- You know what,

34:27.620 --> 34:31.330
it was really sucky, okay?

34:31.330 --> 34:33.420
And I could have
used someone to talk to.

34:33.420 --> 34:37.120
But I get it.
You're off doing your own thing.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.460
You know what?
I'm tired.

34:39.460 --> 34:42.420
Let's just talk tomorrow
when you are sober.

34:42.420 --> 34:44.880
- No, no, no, come on.
What's going on?

34:44.880 --> 34:46.750
- I don't know!
You tell me!

34:46.750 --> 34:48.420
I can hear that
you're in a bathroom.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.830
You're acting totally weird.
You are whispering.

34:50.830 --> 34:52.710
You couldn't wait one day

34:52.710 --> 34:55.670
to get back into
the swing of things?

34:55.670 --> 34:59.750
- You're right.
I'm with someone.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.670
- I knew it.

35:01.670 --> 35:09.170
- I'm with Yuri
who's fixing the television.

35:09.170 --> 35:10.420
It's my wife.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.790
- Who is this, please?

35:12.790 --> 35:16.500
- Hi. Can you hand me
back to Avery, please?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.250
- She wants you back.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.500
- Thank you.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.580
- I'm gonna kill you.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.250
- And I love you.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.500
- I cannot fix this.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.500
I call in the morning
to maintenance. They'll...

35:29.500 --> 35:33.250
- Okay, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, thank you.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.500
And I miss you.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.460
- You do?

35:41.460 --> 35:42.670
- Yes, terribly.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.880
How can I miss you
this much after one day?

35:44.880 --> 35:48.500
- I miss you too.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.790
Why'd you have to leave?

35:49.790 --> 35:51.540
- I don't know.

35:51.540 --> 35:55.460
I thought that
I missed the old me.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.920
And then when I got here,

35:56.920 --> 36:01.170
I realized that
that's not really me anymore.

36:01.170 --> 36:06.040
You know,
I like the new me better.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.460
The one that has you
and Cadence in his life.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.460
I want to come home.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.830
- No, no you don't.

36:12.830 --> 36:16.420
As much as I want you to...

36:16.420 --> 36:18.380
I can't let you.

36:18.380 --> 36:20.880
- Why not?

36:20.880 --> 36:23.420
- Because then you'll
end up resenting me.

36:23.420 --> 36:25.620
You'll act out

36:25.620 --> 36:28.250
and we'll start
repeating old patterns.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.790
It won't be good
for either one of us.

36:29.790 --> 36:32.000
You need to get this
out of your system.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.380
- Yeah, but what about Cadence?

36:34.380 --> 36:37.620
- She's still gonna be here.
So will I.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.420
- Yeah, but she's gonna
do something new,

36:39.420 --> 36:40.420
and I'm gonna miss it.

36:40.420 --> 36:44.170
- I know the feeling.

36:44.170 --> 36:46.710
- I love you.

36:46.710 --> 36:48.710
Call me in the morning.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.210
- Ladies and gentlemen,

36:52.210 --> 36:55.790
please put your hands together
for Mr. Deacon Claybourne!

36:59.750 --> 37:02.710
- Thank you.

37:08.830 --> 37:10.670
I was gonna do something else,

37:10.670 --> 37:14.790
but this seems maybe a little
more appropriate, and uh...

37:17.580 --> 37:20.210

39:14.920 --> 39:17.290
- What happened tonight?

39:17.290 --> 39:19.080
- What's the point
of even saying it?

39:19.080 --> 39:21.080
It's so obvious.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.620
- It's not obvious to me.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.210
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:24.210 --> 39:25.670
- Why you cried.

39:25.670 --> 39:28.040
- Can we please not
talk about that again?

39:28.040 --> 39:29.210
- How long we gonna put it off,
Scarlett?

39:29.210 --> 39:30.790
What? Forever?

39:30.790 --> 39:31.880
When it's staring us
right in the face?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.790
You don't want this.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.170
You've been dancing around it
saying every possible thing,

39:36.170 --> 39:37.330
except--except the truth.

39:37.330 --> 39:38.750
- Oh...

39:38.750 --> 39:40.170
- You don't want to
have this baby with me.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.380
You don't want me, period.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.250
- No, that is not it
at all actually...

39:43.250 --> 39:45.170
- No, that's exactly it.
- No, it's not, Gunnar!

39:45.170 --> 39:47.000
- So just for once, why don't
you just have the courage

39:47.000 --> 39:49.330
just to say it out loud.
- Excuse me?

39:49.330 --> 39:50.500
You don't want me in your life.
It's that.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.500
- (clears throat) Hey, man?

39:52.500 --> 39:54.380
Uh, buy us some beer?
Here's ten bucks.

39:54.380 --> 39:55.750
- Yeah, not tonight,
buddy, all right?

39:55.750 --> 39:59.920
- Oh, please,
it'll only take a second.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.790
- Look, your friend looks
old enough--he can go buy it.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.830
- Well, we tried,
but they're so mean in there.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.540
- You got a lot of time
to drink ahead of you kids.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.170
Just go play some
video games or something.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.750
You'll thank me later.

40:08.750 --> 40:10.380
- Come on. You know you drank
when you were our age, man.

40:10.380 --> 40:12.120
- Yeah, I did a lot of stupid
things when I was your age.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.790
You look smarter.
- No, we're pretty stupid.

40:15.790 --> 40:17.120
- Look, maybe some
other time, okay?

40:17.120 --> 40:18.540
- Come on, man.
You don't gotta be mean too.

40:18.540 --> 40:19.790
- Look, we gotta
be somewhere, okay?

40:19.790 --> 40:21.210
We gotta go, so just get out...

40:21.210 --> 40:22.670
- Where you gotta be
that's so important?

40:22.670 --> 40:23.960
- I said get out of here,
man, okay?

40:23.960 --> 40:27.170
- Oh, God, no, please!

40:27.170 --> 40:29.580
- All right, what are you doing?

40:29.580 --> 40:31.170
- I wanted you
to buy us some beer.

40:31.170 --> 40:32.750
- I'll buy you some beer.

40:32.750 --> 40:35.120
- No, it's too late for that.
Give me your wallet.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.710
- Here's my wallet.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.080
- You too.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.750
- Yep.

40:48.380 --> 40:49.750
Oh! Shoot!

40:49.750 --> 40:51.790
- Now look what you done!
Those are my shoes!

40:51.790 --> 40:53.500
- Hey!

40:53.500 --> 40:54.750
- Leave him alone!

40:54.750 --> 40:56.790
- Shut up, bitch.
- Come on, man.

40:56.790 --> 40:58.500
- You think you're
pretty tough, huh, man?

40:58.500 --> 40:59.920
- You got my wallet.
Please...

40:59.920 --> 41:01.500
- You think you can
tell me what to do?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.170
- No, I don't think
I can tell you anything.

41:03.170 --> 41:06.080
- Get on your knees.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.120
- Come on.
- Jamie, come on.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.500
- Get on your knees.

41:09.500 --> 41:13.040
- Okay, okay.

41:17.460 --> 41:20.880
- Oh, you want my gun.
Come on.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.000
Be a hero for your girl.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.210
So you think you're pretty big?

41:26.210 --> 41:29.040
Well, you're nobody.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.880
You're nobody.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.880
- (screams)

41:39.880 --> 41:41.670
- Come on, come on!
Go, go, go! (laughing)

41:44.620 --> 41:47.880
(crying)
- It's okay.
