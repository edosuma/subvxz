You know you really want me.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.520
No, I don't.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.480
I need someone to
be attracted to me.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.560
OK, is it just me, or areyour wives also acting weird.

career criminal,

still have a career.

to break the law,

And here I thought
her kind couldn't die.

At least something
like that, Bert.

how are you?

07:30.520 --> 07:32.680
Phineas's brothers
and sister are here.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.560
They make me a bit nervous.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.960
And how's Phineas?

07:37.080 --> 07:38.840
He's gone very quiet.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.560
Hardly spoken since
he got the news.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.000
And he hasn't punched any walls.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.640
That's usually what he
does when he's upset.

07:45.760 --> 07:46.680
He fixes them after.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.800
He's real good at fixing walls.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.280
Well, his mammy
meant a lot to him.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.640
He's probably just in shock.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.120
I guess.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.400
And I know it's terrible
that she's dead,

07:55.520 --> 07:59.080
but why did the bitch
have to go and die now?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.120

Any time.

Any time would be finewith me, but not this week.

watch the royal wedding.

for even thinking it!

and get through it, eh?

that can be a tough one

09:14.480 --> 09:16.000
for the uninitiated.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.000
And being an atheist, I don'tsuppose you worry that you'll

09:18.120 --> 09:19.600
be going to hell for that?

09:19.720 --> 09:22.360
I leave the likes of heavenand hell to you and Nora.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.680
Nora, bless her.

complicated woman.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.760
Oh, dear.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.640
She'll be up there shoutingat St. Peter, will she?

09:38.760 --> 09:40.080
If he lets her in.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.600
That's probably why shewanted the extra prayers,

09:41.720 --> 09:43.640
that bloody woman!

09:43.760 --> 09:44.800
What's she done?

09:44.920 --> 09:46.800
Nora was always stirring.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.160
But now she's outdone herself.

09:51.280 --> 09:56.080
Would you say that Phineascan be a violent man?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.360
If the mood takes him?

09:58.480 --> 09:59.280
Uh.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.720
Yeah, absolutely.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.080
Bit of an
understatement, really.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.040
Are you sure?

10:05.160 --> 10:08.840
I mean, that's such ashame, isn't it, Phineas?

10:08.960 --> 10:12.520
But it was lovely to
see you all, wasn't it?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.280
Phineas, you need to
see your family out.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.400
Say goodbye to them, all right?

10:17.520 --> 10:18.360
I'll just pop this down.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.280
Come out and wave bye-bye.

Patrick and Colleen and Shawnhave to go back to Marsden

10:24.240 --> 10:25.600
to milk the cows.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.160
Really?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.000
They couldn't find someoneelse to do that for one day?

10:29.120 --> 10:31.240
Also, I think Phineas iskind of freaking them out.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.520
I can relate to that.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.720
But you know what
this means, don't you?

10:34.840 --> 10:37.280
It means we could
still do the plan.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.200
Which plan is this?

10:38.320 --> 10:39.200
Our plan.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.600
Being there for Lady Di.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.680
I thought you shelvedthat plan when Mammy died.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.320
And now I'm unshelving it.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.680
Of course we can do it.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.520
Are we still doing the
dress part of the plan?

10:48.640 --> 10:50.160
Yes, the whole plan.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.680
Is Phin here?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.880
He's outside, saying
goodbye to his family.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.760
They've fled.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.200
Fled what?

10:59.320 --> 11:00.440
Nora said Phin was theonly one who didn't know.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.440
CAROL: Didn't know what?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.040
Oh, God, what's he doing here?

11:03.160 --> 11:06.120
That's some bloody nerve.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.320
What are you
doing here, Trotsky?

11:07.440 --> 11:09.560
No, I wanted to
come, pay my respects

11:09.680 --> 11:11.560
to Phineas on his loss.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.360
Didn't think you
liked Nora O'Driscoll.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.880
I wouldn't say I liked her.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.760
Bloody difficult woman tolike, but I respected her.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.240
I remember when I
was a constable,

11:19.360 --> 11:21.120
trying to arrest Phineasfor doing something stupid.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.480
Nora called me an
oppressor of the state

11:22.600 --> 11:23.640
and kicked me in the nuts.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.200
Well, she had
her good qualities.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.400
She was a small woman butwith the boot of Don Clark.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.520
Phineas is with his family.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.760
Yeah, I saw them outside.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.400
I'll catch him when
he comes back in.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.320
And in the meantime, I mightjust grab myself a curried egg.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.400
Yeah, that's right.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.160
Get your snout in the trough.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.280
Good sendoff, was it?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.600
Long, but the--
the hymns were nice.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.200
I very much enjoyed meetingup with you on Saturday.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.520
You might want to avoid
the devils on horseback.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.840
Carol can't make anythingshe doesn't burn.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.760
In fact, I can't
stop thinking about it.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.200
Hello, hello, hello.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.200
Here for the free food, are you?

11:56.320 --> 11:59.280
I might just check
on the sausage rolls.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.080
I think there's pork on
the sausage rolls, Mike.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.720
Would that be cannibalismfor your kind?

12:03.840 --> 12:04.680
Funny, Lefty.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.640
Never heard that one before.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.600
Oh, have they gone already?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.000
That was quick.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.520
How are you, soldier?

12:13.640 --> 12:16.200
Father Murphy, uh, just wantsto have a word with you.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.120
Something about your mammy.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.640
This is all a bitbloody awkward, isn't it?

12:24.760 --> 12:25.720
Do you need money?

12:25.840 --> 12:27.000
No.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.960
No, your sister made
a generous donation

12:29.080 --> 12:31.400
to the church restoration fund.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.320
Bless her.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.680
Shall we get on
with it, Father?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.600
God save me.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.840
As you know, I spent a lot oftime with your dear mother.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.800
She really liked
your weekly visits.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.080
Used to get real angry
when you missed one.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.600
Yes, she did.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.040
Anyway, on one of our
visits, um, your mother

12:55.160 --> 13:00.480
gave me this letter andasked me to give it to you

13:00.600 --> 13:02.280
in the event of her death.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.320
This is her will?

13:03.440 --> 13:04.320
No, it's not her will.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.960
- Is this about her house?- No.

13:09.080 --> 13:09.840
A bequest?

13:09.960 --> 13:12.760
No, you need to--

13:12.880 --> 13:13.760
the lad can read, right?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.120
Of course, I can bloody read!

13:15.240 --> 13:16.480
Just a bit difficult right now!

13:16.600 --> 13:19.040
True, she-- she had
an old fashioned hand.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.320
Maybe I could try.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.240
Thanks, Ted.

13:27.360 --> 13:32.440
"My dear son, it's playedin my mind for many years,

13:32.560 --> 13:34.800
that I haven't beenentirely honest with you."

13:39.920 --> 13:41.400
I'm thinking we kick
out the stragglers,

13:41.520 --> 13:43.480
then get our frocks
on and meet at yours.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.120
We have to do the frocks?

13:45.240 --> 13:49.040
Yes, so we're there with LadyDi, in our dresses, in support.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.360
It's like Phineas
and the All-Blacks.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.560
They can't win if
he's not watching.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.840
[screaming]

13:53.960 --> 13:54.760
Phineas.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.560
He's punched something.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.600
[screaming]

13:57.720 --> 13:58.480
And some more things.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.480
Fuck!

14:00.600 --> 14:01.960
Phin?

14:02.080 --> 14:02.960
Phineas?

14:03.080 --> 14:03.840
What the hell?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.960
Phineas?

14:09.080 --> 14:09.880
Phin?

14:17.000 --> 14:17.800
Phineas?

14:20.920 --> 14:22.080
I'll be on my way.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.720
God be with you.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.600
Phineas is gone.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.560
What just happened?

14:27.680 --> 14:31.080
Uh, Phineas, I'm afraid,had a spot of bad news.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.200
Mammy wrote a letter for him.

14:36.320 --> 14:40.280
In it, she explained how,some years ago, she--

14:40.400 --> 14:42.920
she kind of had an affair.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.200
Jesus, Mary, and
all the saints.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.560
After all the crap she threwat me about being a slut?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.720
This is Nora that
you're talking about.

14:49.840 --> 14:53.000
It was many years
ago, after the war,

14:53.120 --> 14:55.080
with a member of
the Maori battalion

14:55.200 --> 14:59.560
who stayed on afterwards,and who went on to join

14:59.680 --> 15:01.240
the Belfast Constabulary.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.520
Phineas isn't
black Irish, is he?

15:03.640 --> 15:05.400
I knew there
was no such thing.

15:05.520 --> 15:06.600
So Phineas is part Maori.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.760
Half Maori, and half cop.

15:09.880 --> 15:10.640
[chuckling]

15:10.760 --> 15:12.240
Bugger me days.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.480
Mammy got it on with a plodder.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.160
It's not bloody
funny, all right?

15:15.280 --> 15:18.120
After all the gip gave me allthese years, I beg to differ.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.400
Bloody mammy!

15:19.520 --> 15:20.720
Poor Phineas.

15:20.840 --> 15:21.640
I need to find him.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.280
No, Carol, Carol.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.480
The lads can do that.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.480
Can we?

15:28.600 --> 15:29.960
Yes, you can.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.400
By following the trailof destruction, presumably.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.320
Then we can all
meet back at our place

15:34.440 --> 15:35.920
and watch the royal wedding.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.160
Do we have to?

15:37.280 --> 15:39.320
Yes, for Carol.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.640
Right, guess we'll
make a night of it.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.520
Come on, lads.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.240
You are such an
amazing friend.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.760
It's nothing.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.000
Go get your stuff.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.480
Well, it was all
rather special.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.920
Enjoy the wedding, ladies.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.480
I'm sure it'll be anight to remember, asshole.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.000
[music playing]

16:09.120 --> 16:10.000
No sign of him.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.000
I think that's a clue.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.240
What is?

16:12.360 --> 16:15.080
Yep, sure looks
like his handiwork.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.840
But where's he going?

16:16.960 --> 16:17.760
Come on, where would he go?

16:17.880 --> 16:18.640
Think like Phineas.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.360
I'll try the pub.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.560
He might blame God,
being Catholic and all.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.160
Of course.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
The messenger.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.280
He'll wanna talk
to the messenger.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.200
Or kill him.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.360
Open up!

16:43.480 --> 16:44.880
I know you're in there.

16:45.000 --> 16:45.880
I know you're in there.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.400
Open up, you fucking bastard!

16:47.520 --> 16:49.320
- He's not in there, Phineas.- This is his church.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.440
He must be in there!

16:50.560 --> 16:51.720
I think if Father
Murphy's wise,

16:51.840 --> 16:52.840
he'll be a long way from here.

16:52.960 --> 16:53.880
And very drunk.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.160
He made her write that letter.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.760
No, he didn't.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.120
Why would he do that?

16:59.240 --> 17:00.640
Fucking church are real
fucking sneaky like that

17:00.760 --> 17:02.000
sometimes.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.120
Phineas, your mother
wrote the letter, OK?

17:03.240 --> 17:04.040
It's all true.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.560
No, it's not!

17:05.680 --> 17:08.840
Open up, open up, open up!

17:11.840 --> 17:13.120
- Hey, come on, mate.
- Open up!

17:13.240 --> 17:14.400
I know you're in there!

17:14.520 --> 17:17.400
Look, Phineas, we
know that you're angry.

17:17.520 --> 17:24.160
Maybe if we all just go get adrink, you know, talk about it?

17:27.040 --> 17:28.840
Yeah, a drink would be good.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.520
That's the spirit.

17:31.640 --> 17:32.440
Come on, mate.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.640
Wow.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.640
It still fits?

17:38.760 --> 17:39.600
Mostly.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.680
Some places are a bit snug.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.960
You should get
changed into yours.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.640
Well, that works.

17:46.760 --> 17:47.800
Have you found him?

17:47.920 --> 17:48.920
They're bringing him in now.

17:49.040 --> 17:49.840
Thank God for that.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.040
In a manner of speaking.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.240
What's this fancy dress now?

17:52.360 --> 17:53.640
It's my wedding dress.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.000
Or, it will be, when I
get all the way into it.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.320
Let me.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.440
Thanks.

17:58.560 --> 17:59.560
Also lovely.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.920
Hello, sweetheart.

18:05.040 --> 18:05.800
You look beautiful.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.760
Baby.

18:06.880 --> 18:07.840
Don't touch me.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.760
Why?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.960
What have I done?

18:11.080 --> 18:12.240
Why did you marry me?

18:12.360 --> 18:13.520
Because I love you.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.920
It's all a bloody
sham, though, isn't it?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.200
- OK, uh--
- Hey?

18:16.320 --> 18:17.400
Phin-- Phin just
needs a beer, so, uh,

18:17.520 --> 18:18.520
let's take it downstairs, eh?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.560
Great idea.

18:20.680 --> 18:21.680
Didn't know you
still had that.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.120
Yet, here it is.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.520
Still got the legs for it.

18:24.640 --> 18:26.840
Should I come?

18:26.960 --> 18:29.800
Uh, probably better ifyou just give us a minute.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.720
You ladies are looking lovely.
- Thanks.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.880
You should get your
wedding dress on.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.480
I would, but I don't
actually have one.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.160
Oh, my God.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.520
I'm so sorry.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.200
I never would havesuggested it if I'd known.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.480
Known what?
Nothing to know.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.360
Who needs a gin.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.800
Me, easy on the tonic.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.320
All good here, love?

18:51.440 --> 18:52.840
Yeah, box of fluffies.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.320
You can go and look
after the real disaster.

19:02.920 --> 19:03.720
Read 'em and weep, boys!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
We got a game going.

19:08.120 --> 19:08.920
Too bad.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.280
Scoot.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.760
You can't tell me to
scoot from my own house.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.600
But I can, 'cause it'smy house, and I pay for it.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.600
Bugger off somewhere else.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.440
Out!

19:19.560 --> 19:21.920
Fascist.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.000
I want to offer my condolenceson the passing of your mother.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.520
You didn't even
know my mother.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.240
But I hear she was awoman of faith and virtue.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.720
And the Bible tells us agood woman is above rubies.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.600
And it's a lovely thought,Falani, but off you go, eh?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.760
Here you go, mate.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.240
Righto, should be
safe down here.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.760
Not a bouquet in sight.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.200
Don't be silly.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.400
You're a vision ofloveliness, all that is pure.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.280
Stop being a girl.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.240
Don't be late.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.680
Don't get into trouble.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.280
Oh, my God.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.560
Do you think when
Phin looks at me,

20:02.680 --> 20:04.840
he'll see his mother,
what his Mammy did

20:04.960 --> 20:07.600
with that Maori battalionguy is, you know,

20:07.720 --> 20:09.400
like what I did with Falani.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.920
You headed away with that boy?

20:11.040 --> 20:11.880
Once.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.040
I was drunk and lonely.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.080
Maybe Mammy was
drunk and lonely.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.480
She did like to drink.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.160
A lot.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.960
Carol, Phineas will not thinkthat, unless you bring it up.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.080
I won't bring it up, then.

20:23.200 --> 20:23.960
Good idea.

NEWSCASTER [ON TV]: And acheer goes up from the crowd.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.720
I guess this
proves it's my fault.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.960
What's your fault?

20:32.080 --> 20:33.680
Why I haven't
given him children.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.840
He's Maori, right?

20:34.960 --> 20:36.280
And they have heaps of children.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.960
They certainly do.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.680
Carol, nothing is your fault.Let's just watch the wedding.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.800
Rita, I don't want
to be a stickybeak,

20:44.920 --> 20:48.960
but why didn't you have a dress?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.720
It didn't seem
important at the time.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.960
No one got invited
to their wedding.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.000
Not even you and Lefty?

20:56.120 --> 20:57.480
No.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.960
But I thought you twowere really good friends.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.680
We knew each other socially.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.480
Went to the some dances,
that kind of thing.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.960
Next thing, they were married.

How long were you engaged?

21:05.520 --> 21:08.200
There wasn't any time,and we didn't wanna wait.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.080
God, that's so romantic.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.680
It wasn't a shotgun
wedding, was it?

21:13.800 --> 21:14.560
No, no.

21:14.680 --> 21:18.080
Wolf came later.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.720
This was more of
a Luger wedding.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.160
A what?

21:22.280 --> 21:23.960
Du kleine Schlampe!

He's a criminal!

Fuck you.

She's here.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.360
She's here.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.840

It's like a great,

No one could force your

27:55.440 --> 27:59.040
He was in a

29:11.480 --> 29:12.520
BERT: It was old
ladies and girls.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.200
They didn't care who they hit.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.960
Then they went down to the copshop and called out the dogs.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.640
That's not on.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.400
Bloody Muldoon, turning thiscountry into a fascist state.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.200
Yeah, they shouldn't beallowed to get away with it.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.560
No, you're too right there.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.080
We should get them back.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.520
Hit the cops where it hurts.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.120
PHINEAS: OK, let's
go hurt a cop.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.800
I'm up for that.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.040
I've got an idea
on how we get them.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.200
Oh, yeah?

29:41.320 --> 29:43.520
What's this idea?

29:43.640 --> 29:45.120
It's a really good one.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.240
I've gotta go.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.560
Phineas's mum passed away.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.480
Mammy's dead?

29:48.600 --> 29:49.720
That's what I said.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.320
MIKE: I thought her
kind couldn't die.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.280
BERT: Catholics.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.560
MIKE: Something like that, Bert.

29:55.680 --> 29:56.800
So how do you know
that the cops won't

29:56.920 --> 29:58.200
be at the social club tonight?

29:58.320 --> 29:59.640
They might be
watching the wedding.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.480
There are protests
everywhere tonight.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.600
So that's where there'll be.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.080
Just trust me on this.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.840
God, it's all so perfect.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.040
She got his name wrong.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.200
It's still perfect.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.200
Yes, until one day she wakesup and realizes she's drunk

30:16.320 --> 30:18.640
and full of Hendrick's.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.880
Why do you keep
trying to ruin my night?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.440
It's not your night, Carol.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.760
I've believed in Lady
Di since the beginning.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.000
I knew she was the one.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.000
You knew?

30:28.120 --> 30:29.600
I'm a bit like Diana myself.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.280
Apart from not being
the daughter of an earl?

30:31.400 --> 30:32.520
I was young like her.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.680
You were a hairdresser
from Swanson.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.560
Phineas was my prince.

30:36.680 --> 30:40.360
He picked me over all thegirls at Friday Night Boxing.

30:40.480 --> 30:43.520
Except maybe he doesn't
love me anymore.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.120
That's what happens
with marriages.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.240
You start out all
hopeful, even if you're

30:47.360 --> 30:48.720
sick as a dog and
your mother won't

30:48.840 --> 30:49.960
let you have a
proper dress, 'cause

30:50.080 --> 30:51.160
she says it's a waste of money.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.440
CAROL: You were sick?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.640
I was three months
pregnant, all right.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.240
And Lefty was so hungover,he could hardly say his vows.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.520
And I stood there and promisedto love and cherish him,

31:00.640 --> 31:04.680
and all I could think wasI was a big, fat liar.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.880
CAROL: You didn't love Lefty?

31:06.000 --> 31:07.600
How about we all
have a cup of tea?

31:11.440 --> 31:13.040
I just have to
go out for a bit.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.160
Now?

31:14.280 --> 31:15.720
Gotta stop the
lads from turning

31:15.840 --> 31:18.800
on each other, and
bloody Muldoon.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.560
'Cause that's important.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.400
How are the ladies?

31:23.520 --> 31:26.440
Carol thinks that Phineasdoesn't love her anymore.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.920
Ngaire's getting dirty drunk.

31:29.040 --> 31:29.840
Nothing new there.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.360
How are you?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.560
Me?

31:38.680 --> 31:39.440
Nothing wrong with me.

31:46.360 --> 31:51.000
It's 20 years,
Rita, our anniversary.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.360
Yeah, it is.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.480
You don't talk about
it, don't tell anyone,

31:56.600 --> 31:57.360
like you're ashamed.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.000
I'm not.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.720
Well, do you regret
it, marrying me?

32:15.320 --> 32:16.160
Of course I don't, Ted.

32:19.000 --> 32:19.880
Are we off?

32:20.000 --> 32:20.800
Yeah.

32:27.080 --> 32:31.320
Every year, anniversary card.

32:31.440 --> 32:35.440
Yeah, it's my own bloody faultfor calling them on our wedding

32:35.560 --> 32:36.640
night to rub their noses in it.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.760
See you soon.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.920
Stealing piss from
the police social club.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.280
You think it's bad idea?

33:13.400 --> 33:14.440
No, I think it's genius.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.320
Shit, let me at the bastard.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.280
Yeah, that'd work too.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.760
[music playing]

33:37.320 --> 33:38.120
Hey!

33:38.240 --> 33:39.120
Phineas, no.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.000
It's too loud.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.080
They'll hear.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.000
True.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.040
[urinating]

33:47.160 --> 33:49.520
[laughter]

33:51.160 --> 33:52.080
Fuck, I love you.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.280
You're my favorite hori.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.840
And you're not bad for a mick.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.960
Well, this is
getting very queer.

33:57.080 --> 33:57.920
I might head off, eh?

33:58.040 --> 33:58.840
You can't go.

33:58.960 --> 33:59.800
You're one of us.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.280
Sure.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.920
Sorry about your mammy.

34:04.040 --> 34:08.240
All right, you need toget back and sort your wife.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.160
Eh?

34:10.280 --> 34:11.800
Your wife, Carol?

34:11.920 --> 34:13.240
You may have lost your
mammy, but you still

34:13.360 --> 34:14.560
got a woman who loves you.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.240
But she didn't know
who she was marrying.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.880
Oh, stop being a twat!

34:19.000 --> 34:21.600
Just got something I needto do on the way home.

34:21.720 --> 34:22.480
One stop off.

34:26.480 --> 34:30.320
She's gonna be so happyand have lots of children.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.080
McArthy cleaning it all up.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.400
How are we, ladies?

34:33.520 --> 34:34.600
Great.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.520
All done and dusted?

34:36.640 --> 34:37.720
Poor old Charles, eh?

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
No escape now.

34:38.960 --> 34:39.840
Where have you lot been?

34:39.960 --> 34:41.560
Sticking it to the cops.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.080
I had an idea, and
it was a good one.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.560
It was.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.360
Best one yet.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.120
Come here, Mrs. O'Driscoll.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.560
My beautiful, beautiful wife.

34:54.680 --> 34:56.560
Come here, wifey.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.840
Oh, playing hard to get, eh?

34:58.960 --> 35:00.160
Oh, shit!

35:00.280 --> 35:01.680
Ah, don't worry about it.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.600
Stupid woman, look
what you made me do!

35:03.720 --> 35:06.840
Ah, yes, I'm always
the problem, aren't I?

35:06.960 --> 35:08.560
Eh?

35:08.680 --> 35:09.440
It was a joke.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.000
You asshole.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.920
Whiskey.

35:14.040 --> 35:14.920
Bloody woman.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.040
[chuckling]

35:17.160 --> 35:19.840
Ngaire, I know
you're not happy,

35:19.960 --> 35:22.560
and I'm sorry your husbandis a fucking prick.

35:22.680 --> 35:26.320
I had Ted, and
you took him off me.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.160
What?

35:29.280 --> 35:30.760
No, I didn't.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.160
We were at that dance, andyou came up in those jeans,

35:33.280 --> 35:36.360
leaving nothing to
the imagination.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.160
He was my boyfriend.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.000
Yeah, then you
took up with Lefty.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.360
Only to make Ted notice me.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.680
Ngaire, I fell
in love with Ted.

35:47.800 --> 35:48.600
And he saved me.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.480
He saved my life.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.520
What a lot of hooey.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.160
If you don't like your
marriage, then leave it.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.360
Oh, you think it's that easy?

35:56.480 --> 35:58.000
No, of course not.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.080
There's a price for everything.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.480
What are you on about?

36:02.600 --> 36:04.120
RITA: If you wantsomething, you have to pay.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.200
And I paid to have Ted.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.680
I haven't seen my family since.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.880
I thought they were dead.

36:13.000 --> 36:13.880
Yeah, there are, to me.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.920
You're a hard woman, Rita.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.200
You do what you
have to, to stay sane.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.120
That's all.

36:51.960 --> 36:52.800
Hello, stranger.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.360
Hi.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.240
How was the funeral.

36:56.360 --> 37:00.160
Incense, altar boys,secrets from beyond the grave.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.080
Sounds intriguing.

37:01.200 --> 37:01.960
You would have loved it.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.600
And I missed you
not being there.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.520
Maybe the next one.

37:12.880 --> 37:18.640
[SINGING] But come ye backwhen summer's in the meadow,

37:18.760 --> 37:22.400
or when the vale is hushedand white with snow.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.160
Your wife's at home.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.280
Best place for her.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.760
If she hasn't crashed the car.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.240
She drives better drunk.

37:33.360 --> 37:38.640
[SINGING] Oh, Danny
boy, I love you so.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.400
Mammy used to sing that to me.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.680
And now I'll sing it for you.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.920
And you'll always be
black Irish to me.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.680
Jesus, talk about
a 10 hanky weepy.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.040
A toast to the women,
who love us, the women,

37:52.160 --> 37:54.080
who gave birth to us--

37:54.200 --> 37:55.480
our mammies.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.400
Mammies.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.040
While we're on the
subject, I'd like

38:05.160 --> 38:06.280
to toast the mother of my son.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.480
Best woman in the
whole bloody world.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.680
Ted, don't.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.960
But with, uh, one
thing or another,

38:15.080 --> 38:18.520
she never got anengagement ring out of me.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.160
So after 20 years,
I bloody owe her.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.040
It's 20 years?

38:22.160 --> 38:23.160
20 great years.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.480
You did me a great honor whenyou agreed to be my wife.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.320
It's a greater honor now.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.480
LEFTY: That's enough of thesentimental claptrap, hm?

38:36.600 --> 38:37.760
How about a song?

38:37.880 --> 38:38.640
And nothing Irish.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.080
Hey, watch it, mate.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.600
Now, we need a proper
New Zealand song.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.600
[SINGING]: Porkarekare ana.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.520
I had a squashed banana.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.600
Is that all right?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.040
I threw it at the teacher.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.480
Is this from the galleria?

38:55.600 --> 38:57.920
Uh, yeah.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.440
So you broke into my storeto get me an engagement ring?

39:00.560 --> 39:02.880
Well, it was a spur
of the moment thing.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.720
Like us, really.

39:04.840 --> 39:05.600
Yeah.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.560
Those bloody royals wouldn'tknow the first thing

39:10.680 --> 39:11.800

You, get away from me.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.120
- I'm in here!
- I'm taking Rita.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.960
You can't stop me.- You get off my property, now!

39:31.080 --> 39:34.520
- No, no.

Don't be stupid, woman!

39:36.280 --> 39:37.240
No, Ted!

39:37.360 --> 39:39.720
You do what I say.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.920
Ted!

39:41.040 --> 39:42.880
You will let him
take our daughter?

39:43.000 --> 39:46.880
Our daughter is already gone.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.840
Oh, Ted!

39:48.960 --> 39:50.840
Did they hurt you?

39:50.960 --> 39:53.120
No.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.160
You stupid woman.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.600
You see what you've done?

39:57.720 --> 39:59.240
Rita's going with me now.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.440
I love her.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.440
And I'm gonna take
good care of her.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.520
You go with him,
you never come back!

40:05.640 --> 40:06.400
Fine with me!

40:16.920 --> 40:17.800
You saved me, Ted.

40:21.560 --> 40:27.680
Your mum, she saved you too.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.600
[SINGING] I threw
it at the teacher,

40:29.720 --> 40:32.840
and the fucking teacher said--

40:32.960 --> 40:34.960
[laughter]

40:36.080 --> 40:38.120
Did you read the card?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.000
Yeah.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.640
Yeah, I read it.

40:40.760 --> 40:43.280
I'll leave it up to you, then.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.600
I fucking love you, Ted West.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.400
Happy anniversary.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.240
I didn't get you
a present, though.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.600
Oh.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.880
Well, I'm sure we can
think of something.

41:00.000 --> 41:00.760
[music playing]

41:00.880 --> 41:03.120
[SINGING] Look at me.

41:03.240 --> 41:07.800
Might take a trip
to Paris to see her.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.280
Good morning, Dr. Jake.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.280
[knocking]

41:17.400 --> 41:19.760
Coming.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.760
[SINGING] What you
got in your bag?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.760
Hello.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.840
[SINGING] Some
people got it bad.

41:27.960 --> 41:28.760
Hello.

41:33.880 --> 41:36.240
[SINGING] You ain't
no stranger here.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.240
Been here before.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.720
Good morning, Madam Blue.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.720
Just like in the cottonfields.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.200
I ain't so glad to see you.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.200
Dance, woman, dance.

41:56.320 --> 42:00.200
All those things you
put me through, baby.

42:04.320 --> 42:08.680
You ain't no stranger here.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.160
Been here before.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.640
Look at me.

42:22.760 --> 42:27.160
Might take a trip
to Paris to see her.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.800
Oh.

42:34.920 --> 42:35.760
I read your card.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.680
What's wrong with him?

42:45.400 --> 42:46.160
MOTHER: He had a stroke.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.440
He-- he can't hurt us.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.120
Not anymore.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.080
My darling!

43:02.200 --> 43:05.520
[SINGING] Good
morning, Madam Blue.

43:05.640 --> 43:09.520
Just like in the cottonfields.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.640
I ain't so glad to see you.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.640
Dance, woman, dance.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.320
All those things you
put me through, baby.

43:21.960 --> 43:26.040
You ain't no stranger here.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.840
Been here before.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.720
Look at me.

43:40.840 --> 43:44.080
Might take a trip to Paris.
