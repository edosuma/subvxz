12:32.664 --> 12:34.231
[phone buzzes,
notification chimes]

12:34.275 --> 12:36.799
[notifications chiming]

12:36.843 --> 12:38.583
- We're just minutes away now
from the closing of--

12:38.627 --> 12:41.543
- We got a situation here.
Excuse me.

12:41.586 --> 12:44.241
- ...is quickly turning
into a mass sell-off.

12:44.285 --> 12:47.244
The share price
of dating company Mr. Wright--

12:47.288 --> 12:48.724
If you're just joining us,

12:48.768 --> 12:49.943
rumors are swirling as to what
could've led...

12:49.986 --> 12:51.379
- God damn it.
- To the drop,

12:51.422 --> 12:52.728
which has investors
retreating--

12:52.772 --> 12:54.643
- Cress, you seeing this?
We're in a free fall.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.166
I need you to call me back
right away.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.038
- We'll have more
as the story develops--

12:58.081 --> 13:00.040
- Sam, what the hell's
going on?

13:00.083 --> 13:01.302
- ...Jackson Wright's company

13:01.345 --> 13:02.651
if he cannot stop
the bleeding.

13:02.694 --> 13:05.219
- I am shocked and saddened
to learn

13:05.262 --> 13:07.612
of the sexual assault
allegations

13:07.656 --> 13:09.527
against Jackson Wright.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.399
He paid lip service
to being invested

13:11.442 --> 13:14.228
in the safety of women
who used our app.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.708
But I now realize he himself
is a predator.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.320
I want to make it clear
that this is not in keeping

13:19.363 --> 13:21.191
with the ethos
of our company--

13:21.235 --> 13:23.106
the company as I know it.

13:23.150 --> 13:27.589
And effective immediately,,
I am resigning my post as CFO.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.591
- What was her reaction
when you first told her

13:29.634 --> 13:31.549
about Lisa's allegations?
- She was shocked.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.942
She didn't believe it.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.422
- Well, she certainly
changed her mind.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.076
Is it possible that
these two women are playing us?

13:36.119 --> 13:38.513
- I certainly hope not.

13:38.556 --> 13:42.169
But that's the first thing that
Jackson Wright's gonna say.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.562
- I am dedicating
my life's work

13:44.606 --> 13:48.001
to the protection
and empowerment of women.

13:53.745 --> 13:53.920
.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.573
- I know what rape is. Okay?

13:55.617 --> 13:56.966
When someone says stop, I stop.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.055
It's not rocket science.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.057
Some of this, I'm used to.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.277
You know,
you get a little success,

14:03.320 --> 14:05.235
people get jealous,
they want to tear you down.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.760
The worst betrayal to me
is that this baseless attack

14:08.804 --> 14:12.677
on my reputation has come
from my CFO

14:12.721 --> 14:15.289
and business partner
of the last 12 years.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.510
- These allegations
have clearly been made

14:19.554 --> 14:21.034
to destroy
my client's company--

14:21.077 --> 14:23.166
- Well, that was fast.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.907
- It's full damage control.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.170
We crossed paths
with his lawyer on the way out.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.651
- Okay, before he lawyered up,
did he make an admission?

14:29.694 --> 14:32.784
- He's not denying a date.
He says the sex was consensual.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.613
He also says he has no idea
why Lisa would think otherwise.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.615
- Yeah, he's lying.
- Yeah, probably.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.009
But Lisa coming forward
and Cress going public

14:40.053 --> 14:41.315
on the same day?

14:41.358 --> 14:42.707
I mean, the timing
of this is suspicious.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.666
- Cress has agreed to come in.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.976
You said
that you have evidence.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.629
- I went to our I.T. team.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.067
We have access
to every member's profile.

14:54.110 --> 14:57.200
I found four other women
who matched with Jackson

14:57.244 --> 15:00.073
who stopped using the app after
going on one date with him.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.814
- Please tell me
that you didn't contact them.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.947
- I'm sorry.
I had to know.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.645
I just--I told them
I was doing market research,

15:07.689 --> 15:09.865
wanted to know
why they stopped using the app.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.521
- We will need their names.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.044
- I can ask them to call you,

15:15.088 --> 15:16.654
but I can't give you
their information.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.656
It violates
our confidentiality agreement.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.093
- I can just get a warrant.

15:22.530 --> 15:26.099
- I have already screwed
this up enough.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.927
The business is imploding.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.711
Jackson is suing me.

15:29.754 --> 15:33.193
It's like I just wasted
the last 12 years of my life.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.544
- I realize that this has been
difficult for you,

15:36.587 --> 15:39.155
but your goddaughter
was just raped.

15:39.199 --> 15:43.725
And if this does go to trial,
then you will need to testify,

15:43.768 --> 15:48.860
so it would be very wise of you
to cooperate with us.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.688
- Three of the women
got back to us.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.690
They said they had bad sex
with Jackson,

15:52.734 --> 15:54.083
but none of them allege
they were raped.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.999
- When Rachel and Cristina
complained to him by DM,

15:57.043 --> 15:59.784
Jackson replied to them
with some version of

15:59.828 --> 16:01.873
"I'm sorry
it got weird for you."

16:01.917 --> 16:03.658
- Which is
the same basic message

16:03.701 --> 16:04.964
that he left Lisa.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.617
- It's not an admission
of assault, though.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.271
- Well, Blair told us
when she DMed him,

16:08.315 --> 16:10.621
she got this response.

16:10.665 --> 16:14.321
- "Equity in the company."
Oh, a trip to Maui.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.714
So he's offering her a bribe.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.978
- That's a Class D felony,
but on Blair's case though,

16:19.021 --> 16:20.240
not Lisa's.

16:20.283 --> 16:21.328
None of these women
want to press charges?

16:21.371 --> 16:22.764
- So far, no.

16:22.807 --> 16:26.768
- Okay, Lisa, her story?
Is it solid?

16:26.811 --> 16:28.857
- It is.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.164
- Good.
I know my next step.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.998
- Mr. Wright, on the charge
of rape in the first degree,

16:39.041 --> 16:41.217
how do you plead?
- Not guilty.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.784
This is a baseless charge

16:42.827 --> 16:44.612
designed to extort money
from my client,

16:44.655 --> 16:48.311
who should be released with the
state's most sincere apologies.

16:48.355 --> 16:49.704
- Right. People on bail?

16:49.747 --> 16:51.053
- We request remand,
your Honor.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.012
Mr. Wright is a man
of considerable means,

16:53.055 --> 16:54.752
and he's shown
he's willing to use that--

16:54.796 --> 16:55.927
- Has the trial begun?

16:55.971 --> 16:57.103
Because I didn't hear
a starting pistol

16:57.146 --> 16:58.539
- I let you speak--
- Boys, boys, boys.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.975
Have we gotten this
out of our systems?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.108
- Your Honor,
this is a he said/she said.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.197
And a lot people hope
to make a profit

17:04.240 --> 17:05.633
off of what she said.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.070
Now, my client only wants
a chance to clear his name

17:08.114 --> 17:10.333
and restore confidence
in his company.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.118
He is not gonna go anywhere.

17:13.945 --> 17:14.903
- I agree.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.601
Defendant is RORed. Bailiff.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.081
- They just let him out?

17:19.125 --> 17:22.258
- Lisa, if he even dares
to contact you, you call me.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.043
Come on.
Let's go.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.395
- Hey, there you are.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.961
No luck getting Jackson
remanded.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.354
I did get
an order of protection, though.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.704
- That's something.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.706
How's Rollins?
- She's hanging in there.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.013
Her mom's gonna be in a cast
for two more weeks.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.102
- Isn't that always
the way it is?

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
The caretaker ends up being
the one that goes down.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.888
- That's exactly
what my mother said.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.978
- Hey, look.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.807
I told Rollins
to take all the time she needs,

17:49.851 --> 17:51.679
but, most importantly,
to take care of herself first.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.116
- Yeah, I did too.
- Captain.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.683
You need to see this.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.250
[dramatic music]

17:57.293 --> 17:58.729
- I'm sure by now
you've all heard

17:58.773 --> 18:01.123
about my
legal situation.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.995
One hot assistant,
who, by the way,

18:04.039 --> 18:08.043
had just gone on a date
with an SVU cop.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.481
Anyway, she suddenly decides
that the hookup we had

18:11.525 --> 18:14.223
was no longer a hookup--

18:14.267 --> 18:15.485
excuse me, ladies--

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
but an assault.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.314
- I didn't tell her to say
it was an assault.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.707
- We know, Velasco.
We know.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.838
- Doesn't matter.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.840
He's just trying
to stir things up.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.712
- And this alleged victim--

18:24.755 --> 18:26.017
no, listen,
don't get me wrong.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.802
She's a sweetheart, right?

18:27.845 --> 18:29.325
I'm not looking to drag
her name through the mud.

18:29.369 --> 18:32.241
Who I am looking to drag is
her godmother,

18:32.285 --> 18:33.460
Cressida Gordon.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.940
She's got an ace
up her sleeve.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.639
You see,
Cress had really planned

18:38.682 --> 18:41.337
to submarine Mr. Wright Now.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.209
She poached our design team.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.908
She poached our marketing,
our IP,

18:46.951 --> 18:50.259
our dating algorithms,
our subscriber list.

18:50.303 --> 18:53.828
She put a completely illegal
scheme in place

18:53.871 --> 18:55.960
to start her own dating app,

18:56.004 --> 18:58.180
violating her duties as CFO

18:58.224 --> 19:01.488
as well as the non-compete
terms of her contract

19:01.531 --> 19:04.012
so she could just go ahead
and launch her own company,

19:04.055 --> 19:06.275
all while demolishing mine.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.843
That's the real story.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.149
- We didn't know
about any of this?

19:10.192 --> 19:11.498
- She wasn't the one
under investigation.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.977
- Well, now she is.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.154
- Well, if any of this is true,
there goes our case.

19:22.335 --> 19:22.552
.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.120
- Morning.
- Morning.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.904
- Did anyone go home?
- I did.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.297
- We're in trouble here.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.691
Ms. Maxwell had martinis
with Jack McCoy last night.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.214
- He wants us
to drop the case?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.390
- Not yet, but he'd prefer
that we didn't get

19:34.434 --> 19:36.566
exculpatory evidence
from a defendant's video rant.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.699
- We're working
on confirmation, Carisi.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.744
- Well,
how about this, Counselor?

19:40.788 --> 19:42.877
One of the business blogs
uncovered a registration

19:42.920 --> 19:45.749
for a new dating app
that traces back to Cress.

19:45.793 --> 19:48.665
- Get her in here now.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.407
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Well, it looks pretty bad.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.409
- My client didn't have
to come in.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.237
Any potential wrongdoing
on her part

19:55.281 --> 19:57.370
should be mitigated
by her cooperation

19:57.413 --> 19:58.762
with the rape investigation.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.199
- Any consideration
on corporate espionage

20:00.242 --> 20:01.417
is beyond my purview.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.463
- We will let
the appropriate agencies

20:03.506 --> 20:04.899
know that you did cooperate.

20:04.942 --> 20:08.511
But right now, why don't you
tell us how we got here?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.866
- After I talked to Lisa,

20:15.910 --> 20:17.651
I knew that I had to resign.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.087
- Mm-hmm.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.958
- I also knew
that it was likely

20:21.002 --> 20:23.222
these allegations
were going to be made public.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.963
- So you decided
to make them public yourself

20:26.007 --> 20:29.271
while you secretly raided
your company's IP and personnel

20:29.315 --> 20:31.969
to fast-track the creation of
your own competing dating app?

20:32.013 --> 20:34.363
- Look, I understand
the timing was a mistake.

20:34.407 --> 20:37.888
But I gotta tell you,
I didn't twist anybody's arm.

20:37.932 --> 20:41.283
Jackson is known for stealing
everybody's ideas.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.806
- Doesn't matter.

20:42.850 --> 20:46.375
- The last thing I wanted to do
is hurt Lisa's case.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.726
And I am still willing
to testify.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.425
- Well, if you do,
the defense will tear you

20:52.468 --> 20:55.254
and Lisa apart.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.994
- How much of this
did Lisa know?

20:57.038 --> 20:58.344
- Nothing.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.606
Not a thing.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.129
- That's gonna be
impossible to prove.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.826
- The son of a bitch

21:02.870 --> 21:06.482
took a torch to the business
I sacrificed everything for,

21:06.526 --> 21:08.528
and now I'm the one
in legal jeopardy?

21:08.571 --> 21:10.269
- Look, I wish I could tell you

21:10.312 --> 21:11.357
that things were gonna
get better,

21:11.400 --> 21:14.925
but this is gonna be
a rough road.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.362
- Lisa, hi.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.712
Thanks for coming in.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.322
How're you doing?

21:20.366 --> 21:22.237
- Not great.

21:25.458 --> 21:30.463
Is SVU gonna drop my case
because of what Cress did?

21:30.506 --> 21:33.161
- That doesn't change the fact
that you were assaulted,
