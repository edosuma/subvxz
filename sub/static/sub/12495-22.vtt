00:15.125 --> 00:16.542
So, who likes

00:15.125 --> 00:16.542
my special pizza?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.583
Uhh...

00:18.625 --> 00:20.458
I don't think Sushi really works

00:18.625 --> 00:20.458
as a pizza topping.

00:22.291 --> 00:25.041
Turn on the TV! Hurry!

00:22.291 --> 00:25.041
Turn on the TV!

00:25.625 --> 00:26.542
Where's the remote?

00:26.583 --> 00:27.333
There's the remote.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.750
What's going on?

00:28.792 --> 00:31.333
Today, after work, I stopped off

00:28.792 --> 00:31.333
at that massage place...

00:31.375 --> 00:32.166
Rub Me Do?

00:32.208 --> 00:32.834
Yeah.

00:33.959 --> 00:37.083
And on my way out, a news

00:33.959 --> 00:37.083
reporter asked me a question.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.375
- Oh, honey,

00:37.125 --> 00:39.375
I'm so proud of you.

00:39.417 --> 00:40.333
I knew that one day--

00:40.375 --> 00:41.417
Ooh, shut up,

00:40.375 --> 00:41.417
it's on.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.250
<i>- Sir, excuse me!</i>

00:42.291 --> 00:43.625
<i>- Yes?</i>

00:43.667 --> 00:46.000

00:43.667 --> 00:46.000
<i>Swellview's ban on plastic bag?</i>

00:46.041 --> 00:48.750
<i>Oh. Well,</i>

00:46.041 --> 00:48.750
<i>I personally believe</i>

00:48.792 --> 00:52.417
<i>that some U.S. Americans</i>

00:48.792 --> 00:52.417
<i>out there in Swellview</i>

00:52.458 --> 00:55.417
<i>don't have plastic bags,</i>

00:55.458 --> 00:59.542

<i>such as South Africa</i>

00:59.583 --> 01:02.333
<i>and the Iraq,</i>

00:59.583 --> 01:02.333

01:04.083 --> 01:05.208

01:05.250 --> 01:06.041
<i>Such as.</i>

01:07.041 --> 01:07.917
That was me.

01:07.959 --> 01:08.709
Impressive.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.959
Yeah,

01:09.083 --> 01:10.959
nailed it, dad.

01:11.291 --> 01:13.458
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11.291 --> 01:13.458
Shh, shh, shh.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.125
<i>And on a sad note today,</i>

01:13.500 --> 01:17.125
<i>Swellview's very own Captain Man</i>

01:17.166 --> 01:20.125
<i>went from super hero</i>

01:17.166 --> 01:20.125
<i>to super jerko.</i>

01:20.750 --> 01:21.583
What?

01:22.291 --> 01:25.500
<i>Warning, the clip we're about</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:25.500
<i>to show you is disturbing.</i>

01:27.125 --> 01:28.000
<i>Hi, kids.</i>

01:28.417 --> 01:29.667
<i>Both: Wow!</i>

01:30.125 --> 01:32.166
<i>You're Captain Man.</i>

01:32.208 --> 01:33.083
<i>That's right.</i>

01:33.792 --> 01:35.166
<i>Hey, how much</i>

01:33.792 --> 01:35.166
<i>for a cup of lemonade?</i>

01:35.542 --> 01:36.333
<i>A dollar.</i>

01:36.375 --> 01:37.041
<i>(gasps)</i>

01:38.125 --> 01:39.750
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:41.291 --> 01:46.250
<i>(screaming)</i>

01:48.083 --> 01:48.917
<i>What a jerk.</i>

01:51.792 --> 01:54.125
I never thought Captain Man

01:51.792 --> 01:54.125
would do something like that.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.041
Neither did I.

01:55.542 --> 01:56.709
(watch beeping)

01:57.333 --> 01:58.125
Now I have to go.

01:58.709 --> 01:59.500
Where are you going?

01:59.834 --> 02:01.125
Uhh. Such as.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.458
Ooh, here's a good one.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.125
Read it.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.875
"Captain Man, the only

02:09.208 --> 02:11.875
difference between you and a box

02:11.917 --> 02:13.750
of poop is the box."

02:13.792 --> 02:15.834
(distance screaming)

02:15.875 --> 02:16.709
(thud)

02:17.041 --> 02:17.917
(elevator dings)

02:19.542 --> 02:20.959
We're here!

02:21.000 --> 02:22.458
(Henry)

02:21.000 --> 02:22.458
Did you guys

02:21.000 --> 02:22.458
see the news?

02:22.500 --> 02:23.959
Yeah, we saw the news.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.959
Everyone hates me now.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.250
Well, why did you smash

02:24.250 --> 02:26.250
those kids' lemonade stand?

02:26.291 --> 02:27.667
A dollar a cup's

02:26.291 --> 02:27.667
not that much.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.709
I didn't smash their lemonade

02:28.834 --> 02:31.709
stand because of the price.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.041
Then why'd you do it?

02:33.667 --> 02:36.125
Because after the little girl

02:33.667 --> 02:36.125
said, "One dollar,"

02:36.166 --> 02:38.250
I noticed a spider

02:36.166 --> 02:38.250
on the lemonade stand.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.041
A red jabber.

02:40.000 --> 02:40.917
A red jabber?

02:40.959 --> 02:41.917
Those are deadly.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.083
I know!

02:43.792 --> 02:46.000
That's why I smashed it

02:43.792 --> 02:46.000
before it could hurt those kids.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.709
Ohhh.

02:50.709 --> 02:52.458
Well, then I say,

02:50.709 --> 02:52.458
who cares?

02:52.750 --> 02:54.458
So what if everybody

02:52.750 --> 02:54.458
hates you now?

02:54.750 --> 02:57.458
I'm a superhero. I don't want

02:54.750 --> 02:57.458
to be hated by everybody.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.291
Well, you are.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.542
Dah.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.542
What am I going to do?

03:01.208 --> 03:04.083
Why don't you just make

03:01.208 --> 03:04.083
a video apologizing?

03:04.667 --> 03:06.792
Yeah,

03:04.667 --> 03:06.792
that's gooood.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.458
The public loves it when famous

03:07.709 --> 03:10.458
people beg for forgiveness.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.709
No. No.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.709
I did nothing wrong.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.208
I don't care

03:12.750 --> 03:14.208
what people think of me.

03:17.041 --> 03:18.125
I'm Captain Man,

03:18.792 --> 03:20.625
and I care very much

03:21.041 --> 03:22.542
what you, the people,

03:21.041 --> 03:22.542
think of me.

03:25.583 --> 03:26.667
It all just

03:25.583 --> 03:26.667
kind of happened.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.041
My dad was

03:27.041 --> 03:29.041
an irresponsible scientist.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.125
I wanted an

03:29.542 --> 03:31.125
afterschool job.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.125
(Captain Man)

03:31.458 --> 03:34.125
And by accident,

03:31.458 --> 03:34.125
he made me indestructible.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.166
Ahhh!

03:35.458 --> 03:37.000
(Henry)

03:35.458 --> 03:37.000
I went to

03:35.458 --> 03:37.000
this crazy store

03:37.667 --> 03:39.250
and met a pretty

03:37.667 --> 03:39.250
interesting guy.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.709
I'm going to

03:39.291 --> 03:40.709
blow your mind.

03:41.125 --> 03:43.333
Now I protect the good

03:41.125 --> 03:43.333
citizens of Swellview.

03:43.709 --> 03:44.875
Who call me...

03:44.917 --> 03:45.834
(Henry)

03:44.917 --> 03:45.834
He turned out to be...

03:45.875 --> 03:46.750
(Captain Man)

03:45.875 --> 03:46.750
You know the name.

03:46.792 --> 03:47.834
Captain Man!

03:47.875 --> 03:48.875
That's right, Henry.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.625
In time, I realized

03:49.417 --> 03:51.625
that being a superhero

03:51.667 --> 03:53.000
is a lot to handle alone.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.083
He wanted some help.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.625
(Captain Man)

03:54.667 --> 03:55.625
I needed a sidekick.

03:55.917 --> 03:57.750
I, Henry Hart...

03:57.792 --> 03:59.208
(Captain Man)

03:57.792 --> 03:59.208
Pledge to never ever

03:57.792 --> 03:59.208
ever tell anyone...

03:59.250 --> 04:00.709
That I'm Captain Man's

03:59.250 --> 04:00.709
secret sidekick.

04:00.750 --> 04:01.875
(Captain Man)

04:00.750 --> 04:01.875
It is done.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.000
(Henry)

04:01.917 --> 04:03.000
Now we blow bubbles.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.083
(Captain Man)

04:03.041 --> 04:04.083
And fight crime.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.125
(Henry)

04:04.125 --> 04:05.125
Feels good.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.458
Call it.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.208
Up the tubeee!

04:22.709 --> 04:23.542
Oh, my boot.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.000
(Captain Man)

04:24.041 --> 04:25.000
Ha!

04:28.083 --> 04:31.083
<i>So, most of you have seen</i>

04:28.083 --> 04:31.083
<i>the viral video of me</i>

04:31.917 --> 04:35.709
<i>in which I used a mailbox</i>

04:31.917 --> 04:35.709
<i>to demolish a lemonade stand</i>

04:35.750 --> 04:36.792
<i>run by two small children.</i>

04:37.917 --> 04:40.166
<i>Since then I've read</i>

04:37.917 --> 04:40.166
<i>many of your comments,</i>

04:41.041 --> 04:42.250
<i>very hurtful comments,</i>

04:42.542 --> 04:44.125
<i>some suggesting</i>

04:42.542 --> 04:44.125
<i>that I should</i>

04:44.709 --> 04:46.834
<i>do things to myself,</i>

04:47.542 --> 04:48.792
<i>some of which are</i>

04:47.542 --> 04:48.792
<i>physically impossible.</i>

04:50.542 --> 04:52.542
<i>But that video didn't</i>

04:50.542 --> 04:52.542
<i>tell the real story.</i>

04:53.000 --> 04:54.917
<i>You see, I spotted</i>

04:53.000 --> 04:54.917
<i>a dangerous spider,</i>

04:55.583 --> 04:58.667
<i>and I used that mailbox</i>

04:55.583 --> 04:58.667
<i>to beat the spider to death.</i>

05:00.417 --> 05:01.208
<i>That's the truth.</i>

05:02.125 --> 05:04.125
<i>And if any of you</i>

05:02.125 --> 05:04.125
<i>were upset by the video,</i>

05:05.458 --> 05:07.250
<i>I am truly sorry.</i>

05:09.458 --> 05:10.250
Huh?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.583
That was perfect.

05:11.625 --> 05:12.375
Yeah?

05:12.417 --> 05:13.166
For sure.

05:13.208 --> 05:13.834
(all talking at once)

05:13.875 --> 05:14.750
You nailed it.

05:14.792 --> 05:15.917
Thanks, guys.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.375
Hey, go online and check what

05:16.750 --> 05:19.375
people are saying about me now.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.458
Yeah. Sure.

05:20.917 --> 05:21.834
Internet!

05:27.792 --> 05:28.500
(Ray)

05:27.792 --> 05:28.500
Well?

05:29.208 --> 05:29.834
Henry?

05:31.291 --> 05:31.959
Uh...

05:32.542 --> 05:35.542
This one says,

05:32.542 --> 05:35.542
"Captain Man,

05:36.583 --> 05:37.917
you liar, I hate you."

05:40.500 --> 05:42.417
Well, that's a little negative.

05:43.250 --> 05:43.917
Charlotte?

05:44.458 --> 05:47.041
This one says,

05:44.458 --> 05:47.041
"Oh, please.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.583
The only reason

05:47.083 --> 05:49.583
Captain Man apologized

05:49.625 --> 05:51.667
is to make us

05:49.625 --> 05:51.667
think he's sorry."

05:53.166 --> 05:54.500
Well, yeah.

05:56.792 --> 05:58.041
Gooch, read.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.458
"Yo, Captain Man,

05:58.667 --> 06:00.458
why don't you"...

06:01.500 --> 06:04.458
My religious beliefs prevent me

06:01.500 --> 06:04.458
from reading the rest out loud.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.291
Schwoz?

06:09.208 --> 06:10.792
This guy just posted

06:09.208 --> 06:10.792
a picture of you,

06:10.834 --> 06:13.375
but he changed your head

06:10.834 --> 06:13.375
to something else.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.792
Changed my head?

06:13.709 --> 06:15.792
What did he change it to?

06:16.417 --> 06:19.208
Oohhh!

06:16.417 --> 06:19.208
That's horrible.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
(Schwoz)

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
What is that?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.291
That's poop.

06:32.875 --> 06:33.834
Ohhh.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.333
Ooh, I have an idea.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.917
Okay, what do people want to

06:35.625 --> 06:38.917
know most about Captain Man?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.625
What he wears

06:39.166 --> 06:40.625
under his man suit?

06:40.667 --> 06:41.834
Dude.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.834
What? No.

06:41.875 --> 06:42.583
Schwoz.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.417
They want to know

06:44.000 --> 06:45.417
where I live and work.

06:45.792 --> 06:48.041
Right.

06:45.792 --> 06:48.041
So we have a contest.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.667
We have a contest.

06:50.709 --> 06:53.709
And the winners get

06:50.709 --> 06:53.709
a private tour of the Man cave.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.333
Of the Man cave.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.250
Wait, we can't reveal the secret

06:57.125 --> 07:00.250
location of the Man cave.

07:00.583 --> 07:01.375
We don't have to.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.417
Gooch will meet the winners

07:02.083 --> 07:03.417
somewhere else,

07:03.458 --> 07:04.291
put them in sacks.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.917
And then he can bring them here

07:05.083 --> 07:06.917
and send them down the tubes.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.458
And send them

07:06.959 --> 07:08.458
down the tubes.

07:08.959 --> 07:09.917
Annoying, isn't it?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.333
But everybody hates me.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.333
Why is a tour

07:15.083 --> 07:16.333
of the Man cave

07:16.375 --> 07:17.834
going to make people

07:16.375 --> 07:17.834
like me again?

07:18.125 --> 07:21.166
Because you know how people are.

07:18.125 --> 07:21.166
They get mad about stuff.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.250
But as soon as you give them

07:21.208 --> 07:23.250
something new to talk about...

07:23.291 --> 07:25.500
They forget they were mad

07:23.291 --> 07:25.500
and focus on the new thing.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.166
Okay.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.542
But what kind of contest

07:29.667 --> 07:31.542
to pick the winners?

07:31.583 --> 07:34.959
We put up a website

07:31.583 --> 07:34.959
so people can go online

07:35.000 --> 07:36.625
and try to guess

07:35.000 --> 07:36.625
some big number.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.875
The first three people

07:37.250 --> 07:39.875
who get it right, win.

07:40.542 --> 07:43.208
And I know the perfect url

07:40.542 --> 07:43.208
for the website.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.291
Guessthatnumber.com.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.709
Oh, hey.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.417
That's pretty clever.

Stay awake.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.417
I want to meet Captain Man.

09:12.458 --> 09:13.583
I fancy Kid Danger.

09:16.875 --> 09:19.542
(Charlotte)

09:16.875 --> 09:19.542
So then my uncle Rosco

09:16.875 --> 09:19.542
tells my aunt Susan,

09:19.834 --> 09:22.417
"oh, no, baby,

09:19.834 --> 09:22.417
I didn't forget.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.125
Look, I made you

09:22.750 --> 09:25.125
a swimsuit calendar."

09:26.709 --> 09:27.500
Oh, were you talking?

09:28.625 --> 09:30.542
You didn't listen

09:28.625 --> 09:30.542
to one word I said.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.792
Well, sorry.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.166
I'm just really worried

09:33.208 --> 09:34.500
that Jasper's going to

09:33.208 --> 09:34.500
win the contest.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.333
He's not going to

09:34.542 --> 09:36.333
win the contest.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.166
He's been sitting

09:36.583 --> 09:38.166
in his basement

09:38.208 --> 09:40.000
for the last four days

09:38.208 --> 09:40.000
trying to guess the number.

09:40.291 --> 09:43.166
Dude, everyone in Swellview's

09:40.291 --> 09:43.166
trying to guess that number.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.959
Yeah, but if Jasper

09:43.208 --> 09:44.959
does win,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.458
he's going to be down in the Man

09:45.000 --> 09:47.458
cave with me for like an hour.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.750
So?

09:48.792 --> 09:50.709
What if he figures

09:48.792 --> 09:50.709
out that-- shh.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.417
What if he figures out

09:52.000 --> 09:53.417
that I'm Kid Danger?

09:53.709 --> 09:57.333
The odds of Jasper winning are,

09:53.709 --> 09:57.333
like, 50 million to one.

09:58.291 --> 09:58.959
All right.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.917
(Piper)

10:00.166 --> 10:01.917
Yeah, let's keep up

10:00.166 --> 10:01.917
the pace.

10:04.709 --> 10:08.417
Come on, my grandma can type

10:04.709 --> 10:08.417
random numbers faster than that.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.542
Piper, what's going on?

10:13.041 --> 10:15.083
I'm paying these kids

10:13.041 --> 10:15.083
to help me win the contest

10:15.125 --> 10:16.333
so I can go

10:15.125 --> 10:16.333
to Captain Man

10:16.375 --> 10:18.166
and Kid Danger's

10:16.375 --> 10:18.166
secret headquarters.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.583
Uh...

10:20.625 --> 10:22.959
There's almost no chance

10:20.625 --> 10:22.959
any of these kids

10:23.000 --> 10:24.375
are going to guess

10:23.000 --> 10:24.375
the right nu--

10:24.417 --> 10:26.625
I got it!

10:24.417 --> 10:26.625
I guessed the number!

10:28.625 --> 10:31.208
I got it!

10:28.625 --> 10:31.208
I guessed the number!

10:31.917 --> 10:33.500
Yay.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.667
Can I have

10:34.834 --> 10:36.667
my laptop back?

10:36.709 --> 10:38.458
No!

10:36.709 --> 10:38.458
Mine now!

10:42.333 --> 10:44.583
I guess you guys

10:42.333 --> 10:44.583
can go home now.

10:45.208 --> 10:45.917
No, we can't.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.875
Piper took our shoes.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.792
<i>Well, three lucky winners</i>

11:20.625 --> 11:21.875
Boosh.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.542
Yeah, they didn't

11:23.083 --> 11:24.542
even mention

11:24.583 --> 11:26.875
the horrible thing you did

11:24.583 --> 11:26.875
to those kids' lemonade stand.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.792
I know.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.792
Hyah!

11:31.333 --> 11:34.583

11:31.333 --> 11:34.583

11:34.625 --> 11:35.959
(laughs)

11:36.625 --> 11:39.041
Aw, this whole VIP tour

11:36.625 --> 11:39.041
thing was the perfect idea.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.834
(elevator dings)

11:41.709 --> 11:43.792
We got to

11:41.709 --> 11:43.792
cancel the VIP tour thing.

11:44.166 --> 11:44.792
What?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.166
One of the winners

11:45.500 --> 11:47.166
is my little sister, Piper.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.125
Really?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.458
Who's she going

11:49.041 --> 11:50.458
to bring as her guest?

11:51.041 --> 11:52.125
She gonna bring

11:51.041 --> 11:52.125
your mom?

11:53.291 --> 11:54.667
I don't know

11:53.291 --> 11:54.667
who she's bringing.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.500
Henry's afraid that Piper's

11:54.709 --> 11:56.500
going to recognize him.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.208
Oh, no, she won't.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.208
You're going to be in your

11:58.250 --> 12:01.208
Kid Danger suit and mask.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.166
Well, yeah, but she's going

12:01.458 --> 12:03.166
to be down here

12:03.208 --> 12:05.000
with us for,

12:03.208 --> 12:05.000
like, an hour.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.875
All right,

12:05.041 --> 12:06.875
calm down your pants.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.709
Schwoz can disguise

12:08.250 --> 12:09.709
your face.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.000
Really?

12:11.542 --> 12:13.250
Yeah, I give you

12:11.542 --> 12:13.250
good face disguise.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.834
What about my voice?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.709
Can you disguise

12:14.875 --> 12:16.709
his voice, too?

12:17.083 --> 12:17.792
Easy.

12:18.709 --> 12:19.333
Look.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.583
(clears throat)

12:22.542 --> 12:24.125
(speaking with kid's voice)

12:22.542 --> 12:24.125
Excuse me.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.625
Henry?

12:25.333 --> 12:27.625
Will you help me find my mommy?

12:28.959 --> 12:31.125
Ooh, quit it.

12:28.959 --> 12:31.125
That's so creepy.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.959
Will you buy me a pony?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.250
Aah.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.250
Stop that!

12:39.792 --> 12:40.959
Pleeease?

12:41.625 --> 12:42.291
No!

12:43.208 --> 12:45.667
But it's my dream to see

12:43.208 --> 12:45.667
Captain Man's headquarters.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.291
Please let me

12:45.709 --> 12:47.291
be your guest.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.208
Will you wear whatever

12:48.375 --> 12:50.208
I tell you to wear?

12:50.834 --> 12:51.834
I don't know.

12:52.417 --> 12:54.166
My mom usually

12:52.417 --> 12:54.166
picks my outfits.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.291
Will you wear whatever

12:55.375 --> 12:58.291
I tell you to wear?

12:58.625 --> 12:59.583
I...

13:00.125 --> 13:01.875
You have three seconds

13:00.125 --> 13:01.875
to answer. One...

13:01.917 --> 13:03.208
Wait.

13:01.917 --> 13:03.208
Two...

13:03.583 --> 13:05.917
Yes, I'll wear anything.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.917
I'll wear anything.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.750
Fine.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.750
You can be my guest.

13:10.041 --> 13:12.834
Yes! All right!

13:13.250 --> 13:15.000
Whoo! Yeah!

13:16.542 --> 13:17.667
Ohh.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.166
Uhh, what's going on here?

13:19.709 --> 13:21.291
I'm going to be

13:19.709 --> 13:21.291
Piper's guest

13:21.333 --> 13:23.875
when she goes to Captain Man's

13:21.333 --> 13:23.875
secret headquarters.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.083
Gyahhh!

13:27.375 --> 13:27.959
That's great, man.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.250
Gyaaahhh!

13:38.375 --> 13:41.208
Hey, look who's here.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.250
Whoa.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.250
Wooow.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.333
How do I look?

13:52.375 --> 13:53.875
Completely unrecognizable.

13:53.917 --> 13:54.792
Good.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.792
Wait.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.792
What about his voice?

13:56.834 --> 13:57.834
Oh, yeah.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.750
(beeps)

14:00.792 --> 14:02.709
Now, sing the Little Pea Pod

14:00.792 --> 14:02.709
song.

14:04.250 --> 14:07.750
(sings in a low voice)

14:04.250 --> 14:07.750
♪ I'm a little pea pod

Henry, good luck.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.208
- Charlotte, let's go.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.208
- Okay.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.333
- Whoa. Where are you

14:22.250 --> 14:25.333
taking Charlotte?

14:22.250 --> 14:25.333
- To pick up my sister

14:22.250 --> 14:25.333

14:25.375 --> 14:26.834
Your sister who looks

14:25.375 --> 14:26.834

14:26.959 --> 14:27.917
Yeah, that one.

14:28.875 --> 14:29.875
Come on.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.250
It's not nice to say that your

14:31.041 --> 14:33.250
own sister looks like a horse.

14:33.917 --> 14:34.750
Show her a pic.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.458
Oh!

14:39.625 --> 14:41.834
That is one crazy

14:39.625 --> 14:41.834
looking lady.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.083
Her name is Winnie.

14:45.291 --> 14:45.959
For real?

14:46.792 --> 14:47.792
Winnie.

14:48.667 --> 14:49.959
(whinnying)

15:03.667 --> 15:05.458
Hey, if we get

15:03.667 --> 15:05.458
pulled over by a cop,

15:05.750 --> 15:07.917
switch places with me

15:05.750 --> 15:07.917
real quick, okay?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.208
Why?

15:10.917 --> 15:13.500
Because I'm not

15:10.917 --> 15:13.500
legally allowed to drive.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.125
You don't have

15:14.417 --> 15:16.125
a driver's license?

15:16.709 --> 15:18.208
No, I do. I do.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.458
But it says I have

15:18.625 --> 15:20.458
to be wearing my glasses

15:20.500 --> 15:22.166
because I can't see

15:20.500 --> 15:22.166
at night.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.041
You can't see?

15:24.667 --> 15:25.875
No, I can see.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.250
Like, I know

15:26.458 --> 15:28.250
we're in a car.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.083
Can you see

15:31.500 --> 15:33.083
those trash cans?

15:33.333 --> 15:33.917
Eh?

15:33.959 --> 15:35.417
(crashes)

15:35.792 --> 15:37.875
(car honking)

15:40.125 --> 15:42.083
I'll try to warn you

15:40.125 --> 15:42.083
sooner next time.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.458
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.709
(Captain Man)

15:53.417 --> 15:55.709
Hey, there.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.709
We got you.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.542
All right.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.542
There you go.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.000
One foot in front

15:59.291 --> 16:01.000
of the other.

16:02.208 --> 16:04.750
Okay, contest winners

16:02.208 --> 16:04.750
and guests.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.208
Drop your sacks.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.959
Welcome to the Man Cave.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.458
Wooow.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.333
I'm Jasper.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.333
Remember me?

16:16.375 --> 16:17.041
Yeah.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.250
Why are you wearing that?

16:19.667 --> 16:21.166
Oh, she made me.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.125
Nice.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.709
Can you step away from me?

16:25.750 --> 16:26.375
Oh, sure.

16:28.375 --> 16:30.000
Of course, you people

16:28.375 --> 16:30.000
all know my sidekick.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.750
Kid Danger!

16:31.792 --> 16:33.000
That's right.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.291
We're really excited

16:33.709 --> 16:35.291
to show you the Man Cave.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.125
What's wrong

16:36.542 --> 16:38.125
with your voice?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.500
And your face?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.125
Uh, he--

16:41.166 --> 16:42.250
I went through puberty.

16:43.709 --> 16:45.542
Now, you two

16:43.709 --> 16:45.542
I've met before, but...

16:45.834 --> 16:47.041
What are your names?

16:47.083 --> 16:49.041
(giggling)

16:53.959 --> 16:54.917
And you?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.208
I'm Dennis.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.333
I collect celebrity socks.

17:00.875 --> 17:01.792
Where's your guest?

17:02.375 --> 17:03.083
I came alone.

17:04.792 --> 17:07.041
This sock belonged

17:04.792 --> 17:07.041
to Jennifer Lawrence.

17:10.417 --> 17:11.834
Wow. That's cool.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.291
That's really cool, man.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.291
Not at all weird.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.375
So, where do you guys

17:14.875 --> 17:17.375
keep your weapons?

17:19.959 --> 17:21.000
Uh...

17:21.375 --> 17:22.458
We're going to

17:21.375 --> 17:22.458
show you those later.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.083
Good.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.583
Heeey!

17:27.250 --> 17:28.625
What you,

17:27.250 --> 17:28.625
what you doing there?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.208
- Ahhh!

17:29.000 --> 17:31.208
- Ooh!

17:32.041 --> 17:33.166
Uhh, guys?

17:33.208 --> 17:35.083
We're about

17:33.208 --> 17:35.083
to start the tour.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.542
This isn't part--

17:36.583 --> 17:37.917
(laughing)

17:38.417 --> 17:40.667
Okay, the rest of you,

17:38.417 --> 17:40.667
this way.

17:50.959 --> 17:53.500
So... How was your flight?

17:54.208 --> 17:56.625
Bad.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.625
They gave me no snacks.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.709
Schwoz,

17:57.333 --> 17:59.709
you bring me a snack?

17:59.750 --> 18:00.667
Yeah, yeah.

18:01.458 --> 18:04.083
Charlotte, there's some sugar

18:01.458 --> 18:04.083
cubes in that bag there.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.166
Uhh. Okay.

18:10.750 --> 18:11.375
Here you go.

18:13.709 --> 18:14.458
Oh!

18:16.291 --> 18:18.417
Oh, her tongue

18:16.291 --> 18:18.417
feels weird on my hand.

18:20.417 --> 18:21.417
Tell me about it.

18:22.792 --> 18:25.208
(whinny laugh)

18:36.458 --> 18:39.166
Okay, Dennis,

18:36.458 --> 18:39.166
your turn.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.667
I'm okay.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.250
Thank you.

18:51.208 --> 18:54.250
Now that you've all had a chance

18:51.208 --> 18:54.250
to break a chair on me,

18:55.250 --> 18:56.083
let's go check out--

18:56.125 --> 18:57.250
Your weapons?

18:58.875 --> 19:00.792
Yeah. Our weapons.

19:01.041 --> 19:02.041
Yes.

19:13.792 --> 19:17.333
Now, these are some of

19:13.792 --> 19:17.333
our best weapons that Kid Danger

19:17.375 --> 19:18.917
and I use

19:17.375 --> 19:18.917
for crime fighting.

19:19.166 --> 19:20.583
What's that hot dog for?

19:21.000 --> 19:21.875
Ah.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.417
Looks like a hot dog,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.417
doesn't it?

19:25.083 --> 19:27.417
We call this

19:25.083 --> 19:27.417
the "covert weiner."

19:28.500 --> 19:29.709
Covert weiner?

19:30.291 --> 19:30.917
Yes.

19:31.750 --> 19:32.375
Kid Danger?

19:33.875 --> 19:36.417
You see, he appears

19:33.875 --> 19:36.417
to be a normal citizen

19:36.792 --> 19:38.417
just enjoying

19:36.792 --> 19:38.417
a hot dog.

19:38.709 --> 19:40.500
Mmm,

19:38.709 --> 19:40.500
what a tasty hot dog.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.083
But watch this.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.291
Kid Danger,

19:43.667 --> 19:45.291
bad guy over there!

19:45.875 --> 19:46.834
Freeze, sucker!

19:51.875 --> 19:52.875
Whoa!

19:52.917 --> 19:53.792
Awesome!

19:53.834 --> 19:55.166
Yeees!

19:56.750 --> 19:58.500
Yes, it's incredibly powerful.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.458
Any one person

19:59.208 --> 20:01.458
could use this weapon

20:01.500 --> 20:04.375
to defeat the entire army

20:01.500 --> 20:04.375
of a small country.

20:04.417 --> 20:05.083
Can I see it?

20:05.125 --> 20:05.834
Yeah, sure.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.000
Okay, nobody move!

20:10.417 --> 20:11.375
He's got the weiner!

20:14.250 --> 20:15.709
Put that

20:14.250 --> 20:15.709
hot dog down, Dennis!

20:15.750 --> 20:16.792
No!

20:16.834 --> 20:19.208
You sick loner!

20:20.041 --> 20:20.834
Don't do it!

20:24.166 --> 20:26.375
Now, anybody tries

20:24.166 --> 20:26.375
to stop me,

20:26.417 --> 20:28.375
this weirdly dressed kid

20:26.417 --> 20:28.375
gets it.

20:29.083 --> 20:33.417
All right, Dennis, just relax.

20:29.083 --> 20:33.417
Everything's fine.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.041
Don't talk to me

20:33.458 --> 20:35.041
in a calming voice!

20:36.000 --> 20:37.583
Just tell me

20:36.000 --> 20:37.583
the fastest way out of here!

20:38.041 --> 20:38.750
All right.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.500
Just step up there and a tube

20:39.750 --> 20:42.500
will come down over you.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.875
And then you just say

20:43.166 --> 20:44.875
"Up the tube."

20:51.750 --> 20:52.500
Up the tube!

20:55.041 --> 20:56.709
You let him get away!

20:57.417 --> 20:58.208
Did I?

20:58.750 --> 20:59.875
Override.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.166
(alarm beeping)

21:01.208 --> 21:02.375
Reverse suckage.

21:02.417 --> 21:03.250
Double power.

21:05.709 --> 21:06.542
Oh!

21:06.875 --> 21:07.834
Up the tube!

21:07.875 --> 21:09.083
No, wait!

21:09.959 --> 21:10.583
Down the tube!

21:11.917 --> 21:12.792
Ugh!

21:12.834 --> 21:13.542
Tube up!

21:16.208 --> 21:17.208
Right tube down!

21:17.834 --> 21:19.291
No, wait, ow!

21:20.959 --> 21:21.709
Get the covert weiner.

21:21.750 --> 21:22.417
Yep.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.333
Nice going, Kid Danger.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.625
Just doing my job, brother.

21:30.709 --> 21:32.542
And now,

21:30.709 --> 21:32.542
triple sequence.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.709
Tube up, tube down, tube up,

21:33.041 --> 21:35.709
tube down, tube up, tube down...

21:36.375 --> 21:37.166
Go.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.750
Please turn off the--ow!

21:39.041 --> 21:40.750
Hey-- ow!

21:40.792 --> 21:42.542
I can't take it-- ow!

21:45.208 --> 21:47.917
Hey, remember when you smashed

21:45.208 --> 21:47.917
that lemonade stand

21:47.959 --> 21:49.250
and everybody was

21:47.959 --> 21:49.250
mad at you?

21:49.291 --> 21:49.959
Yeah.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.709
That seems like

21:50.458 --> 21:52.709
a long time ago.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.500
Right?

21:54.917 --> 21:56.041
(laughing)
