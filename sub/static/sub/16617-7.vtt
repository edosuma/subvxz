00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man on Earth.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.436
Yes!

00:04.438 --> 00:05.971
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
<i>And check out</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.708
Bob's Burgers--
Whoo!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
<i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.546
-Can me and Ramon
go ride shirtless bikes?
-(sighs)

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.451 --> 00:20.219
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...
Oh, is this Mark?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.287
The last time you saw him
he was on his way to Tokyo?

00:22.289 --> 00:24.223
Mark is dead, Tandy!
Who knows?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.290
What if he comes back
in the future?

00:25.292 --> 00:26.825
<i>Leave him a note</i>
<i>with our address.</i>

00:26.827 --> 00:28.360
CAROL:
Adoption papers?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.062
If you're gonna be
the baby's grandmother,

00:30.064 --> 00:31.563
then I need to be your daughter.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.732
Oh, hell,
where's the damn papers?

00:33.734 --> 00:35.834
So, let's get busy getting busy.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.336
You're not okay, Melissa!

00:37.338 --> 00:39.238
<i>Something is seriously wrong</i>
<i>with you.</i>

00:46.746 --> 00:48.814
Hi, Mom.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.486
Hi... daughter.

00:54.488 --> 00:58.757
Are you ready
for family photo time?

00:58.759 --> 01:01.193
Oh.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.594
Uh...

01:02.596 --> 01:04.430
I know. It's the best, right?

01:04.432 --> 01:07.199
Mm... So, wait.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.102
What are we talking?
Is it hands on the shoulder,

01:10.104 --> 01:14.106
leaning on a fence,
just generally being tools?

01:14.108 --> 01:15.841
Mother!

01:15.843 --> 01:18.277
Okay. Let's get it over with.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.278
Come on.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.780
Oh, goodie. Here.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.450
Oh, no.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.585
Oh, they're your size.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.287
Yeah. Okay, I'm really not

01:28.289 --> 01:31.523
into the matching outfit
kind of thing, hon.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.292
Oh, but they're for
our Christmas cards.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.626
Sorry. Holiday cards. Wait.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.195
Klosterman. What are we?

01:36.197 --> 01:37.529
We are from the church

01:37.531 --> 01:39.798
of what you're wearing
is what you're wearing.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.468
Tandy, she's pushing back
on the clothes!

01:42.470 --> 01:44.903
Come on, Mom.
What's the issue?

01:44.905 --> 01:47.473
(power whirring down)

01:47.475 --> 01:49.308
Huh.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.642
(power whirring on)

01:50.644 --> 01:52.377
Huh.
That's weird.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.480
Wonder what
happened there.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.548
Anyway, Mom...

01:56.550 --> 01:59.384
(scoffs) Mom?

01:59.386 --> 02:02.221
(shouting):
Mom!

02:03.323 --> 02:05.390
(both sigh)

02:07.594 --> 02:09.828
(sighs)
Oh, look at that.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.497
TANDY:
Lewis.
Hey.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.498
Hi, Lewis!

02:12.500 --> 02:13.832
Hi.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.667
What's with the, uh...

02:15.669 --> 02:17.569
cool outfits?

02:17.571 --> 02:18.837
They<i> are</i> cool, right?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.606
We're taking our family photo.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.940
Well,

02:21.942 --> 02:24.810
we're trying to, but my mom
is throwing a real wrench

02:24.812 --> 02:25.944
into the works.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.446
I'm sorry. Your mom?

02:27.448 --> 02:28.814
Carol made Gail
legally adopt her

02:28.816 --> 02:30.516
so Gail could be
our baby's grandma.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.750
One of those deals.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.918
And now Mom won't wear

02:32.920 --> 02:34.820
the outfit,
so the family photo's ruined.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.355
Well, why don't you

02:36.357 --> 02:38.524
just take the picture
wearing normal clothes?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.859
I mean, is the matching outfit

02:40.861 --> 02:42.661
really that important?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.964
It's a family photo.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.866
Right.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.502
Uh, anyway, Tandy,

02:50.504 --> 02:51.770
I just wanted
to thank you again

02:51.772 --> 02:53.205
for our trip.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.540
That really inspired me.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.209
Hey, well, your love for Mark
inspires me

02:57.211 --> 02:59.444
to be a better husband to Carol.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.446
So take that
and put it in your butt.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.315
Uh, literally. (chuckles)

03:03.317 --> 03:05.784
I think you meant
metaphorically.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.220
Oh, yes. "Metorically." Sorry.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.688
Close enough.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.557
And you're close enough
for a little hug.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.791
Get in here.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.493
Mm.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.994
Proud of you, bud.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.998
Your smile is super infectious,
like the virus, huh?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.402
(laughs): And again,
I mean that metorically.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.310
Hey.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.912
What, Todd?

03:33.914 --> 03:34.980
Oh.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.582
Who's this?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.483
This is Alden.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.586
Right. Okay.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.355
Well, hi, Alden.
How you doing, buddy?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.023
Todd, he's not real.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.925
(sighs) Okay, good. Thank God.
I... Sorry...

03:46.927 --> 03:48.327
Oh.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.896
Shh. Mommy didn't mean it.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.431
Stop. Oh. Shh.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.765
Mommy didn't mean it.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.435
He heard what I said.
He's very upset.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.570
Well, uh, listen,
about-about the other night,

03:58.572 --> 04:00.339
I'm real... I'm really sorry
for upsetting you.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.940
I was just concerned about you,
and I...

04:01.942 --> 04:03.275
Oh, don't worry.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.876
It's not your problem anymore.
No. Sure it is.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.777
I'm your boyfriend, so...

04:05.779 --> 04:07.946
Not anymore.
What?

04:07.948 --> 04:09.948
Oh. I'm breaking up with you.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.884
I want a baby, you don't want
a baby, so you can leave.

04:12.886 --> 04:13.885
No.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.687
I'm staying right here, okay?

04:15.689 --> 04:18.457
Listen to me. You are not okay,
and I want to help you.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.292
And I don't need your help!

04:20.294 --> 04:21.293
Leave!

04:21.295 --> 04:24.062
Okay.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.931
If that's what you want.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.733
Shh.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.801
There. Shh.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.470
I scared you,
didn't I?

04:31.472 --> 04:34.139
Okay. Nap time.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.555
(sighs, groans)

04:51.491 --> 04:54.393
(sighs)

04:54.395 --> 04:55.661
(clears throat)

04:55.663 --> 04:57.729
Hi, Mom.
(chuckles softly)

04:57.731 --> 05:00.432
I'm not putting on one of those
dumb little trench coats,

05:00.434 --> 05:02.100
if that's what y'all
are thinking.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.669
(laughs):
No way.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.337
And we wouldn't expect you to.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.339
No, you just sit
there and relax

05:07.341 --> 05:09.574
in the clothes that
you're wearing.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.049
(chuckles)

05:20.987 --> 05:22.354
Now!

05:22.356 --> 05:24.523
Oh, good Lord.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.091
(camera clicking)
Okay.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.627
Uh, Mom, open
your eyes.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.028
I see what you're
doing. Please?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.763
Get those eyes open.
Come on.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.832
Hell no.
Mother!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.935
GAIL: Look, I already told you,
I'm happy to take a picture

05:36.937 --> 05:39.538
wearing normal clothes, but
I'm not gonna be the matriarch

05:39.540 --> 05:41.440
of some weirdo family.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.675
You are wearing
normal clothes!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.110
GAIL: Nice try.
CAROL: All right.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.979
Well... we gave it
our best, Tandy.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.614
Yup.
Guess we're giving up.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.550
Uh-huh.
You go back
to your day.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.618
Fine. Leaving
the room now.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.853
On my way out now.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.154
Bye-bye, Tandy.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.458
(footsteps getting quieter)

05:59.460 --> 06:02.828
You can hear his feet getting
further and further away.

06:02.830 --> 06:06.498
Oh, he's rounding
the far corner.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.033
(thud, clattering)

06:08.035 --> 06:09.735
Oops. He dropped
something.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.503
Did you hear that
way over there?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.505
And he's gone.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.907
Aw, just the
two of us.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.909
You can open
your eyes now.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.745
Mom, open 'em.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.680
You know what?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.649
Y'all got to get up
a little earlier in the day

06:24.651 --> 06:27.753
to pull one over
on Gail Klosterman.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.921
(sighs)

06:29.923 --> 06:34.025
You can follow me,
but I'm not gonna open my eyes.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.527
Uh-oh!
Oh, come on.
(camera clicking)

06:35.529 --> 06:37.095
Mother Hubbard,
a triple rainbow!

06:37.097 --> 06:39.097
A human centipede with
George Clooney at the front!

06:39.099 --> 06:40.932
(gasps)
A Nebuchadnezzar of wine!

06:40.934 --> 06:42.834
TANDY:
Ooh, ooh. Uh, snakes!

06:42.836 --> 06:44.536
(elevator bell dings)

06:44.538 --> 06:46.438
Watch out, Mom!
It's an open shaft!

06:46.440 --> 06:49.775
(Tandy and Carol yelling)

06:49.777 --> 06:51.643
Burn.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.524
(alarm beeping)

07:05.526 --> 07:06.858
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Increase altitude.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.226
Increase altitude.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.529
Stall. Stall. Stall. Stall.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.530
No, no, no, no, no!

07:11.532 --> 07:12.564
Increase velocity.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.699
Velocity. Uh, switch...

07:14.701 --> 07:16.635
Increase velocity. Pull up.
Throttle up. Throttle up!

07:16.637 --> 07:18.804
Terrain alert. Pull up.
Terrain alert.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.872
Pull up. Terrain alert.
(screams)

07:20.874 --> 07:22.774
(alarm beeping)

07:24.143 --> 07:26.077
(alarm stops)

07:26.079 --> 07:28.713
(whirring)

07:28.715 --> 07:30.482
(laughs)

07:30.484 --> 07:33.985
Well, that's the craziest
video game I've ever seen.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.121
It's actually
a flight simulator.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.223
You learning how to fly?
Well,

07:38.225 --> 07:41.893
figure, if I get good enough--
I don't know--

07:41.895 --> 07:46.731
maybe one day I can fly off
to Tokyo and look for Mark.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.169
(crying):
That is so beautiful.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.672
Oh. (crying)

07:53.674 --> 07:55.807
Sorry. Hormones,
<i>and</i> it's beautiful.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.176
I'm just really
happy for you.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.745
It's like Christmas Day,

08:00.747 --> 08:03.615
and I got all the presents
I asked for.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.150
(crying)

08:10.022 --> 08:11.690
Hey, bud,
how goes it?

08:11.692 --> 08:13.758
Um, Melissa just
broke up with me.

08:14.694 --> 08:15.927
Yes!

08:15.929 --> 08:17.863
Oh. I'm sorry.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.165
Uh, the "yes" was about
the plate, not the breakup.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.201
As for the breakup: no.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.103
I'm worried about her, man.
She's not okay.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.705
I want to help her,

08:26.707 --> 08:28.874
but she just screamed at me
to get out, so...

08:28.876 --> 08:31.543
Hey, how about I do a little
drive-by, see how she's doing?

08:31.545 --> 08:33.144
Would it make you feel better?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.212
Would you, bud?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.948
Of course, bud.
Heading there now.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.052
(whirring)

08:50.296 --> 08:52.230
There you are!

08:52.232 --> 08:53.899
Were you hiding from me?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.067
Whatever gave you that idea?

08:56.069 --> 08:58.870
Mother-daughter intuition.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.906
It's windy up here.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.707
And yet, for reasons of my own,

09:02.709 --> 09:05.343
I find it preferable
to being downstairs.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.747
I was wondering if I could
expect you for dinner tonight.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.683
That would be a firm no.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.919
Oh. Aren't you
a ray of sunshine!

09:13.921 --> 09:15.820
I wonder
if those colorful beverages

09:15.822 --> 09:17.756
have anything to do with it?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.257
You leave my beverages
out of this!

09:19.259 --> 09:20.592
I'm just saying,

09:20.594 --> 09:22.260
maybe you'd be
a little less snippy

09:22.262 --> 09:23.762
if you were more hydrated.

09:23.764 --> 09:28.199
Look, this is my Zen area.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.937
Whatever I do up here
is my business!

09:31.939 --> 09:35.840
Not if your business is the
Big Tobacco and Alcohol trade!

09:35.842 --> 09:38.076
Oh, my<i> God,</i> give it a rest!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.177
I will not.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.613
You are supposed to be
the responsible one.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.949
You are the goll-dang mom
for ding-dong's sake,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.116
you goll-dang ding-a-ling!

09:45.118 --> 09:46.351
Okay!

09:46.353 --> 09:48.386
You're grounded!
Go to your room!

09:48.388 --> 09:51.256
Seriously?!
Yes!

09:51.258 --> 09:55.393
You came up here, and you
interrupted Mommy's quiet time!

09:55.395 --> 09:56.962
That is so unfair!

09:56.964 --> 09:58.296
You just go on!

09:58.298 --> 10:00.198
You just march on down there,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.634
and you think about
what you've done, young lady.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.070
I hate you! You're a monster!

10:05.072 --> 10:07.639
Yeah?! Well, one of these days,
I'm not gonna be here,

10:07.641 --> 10:10.308
and you're gonna be
so sorry you said that!

10:10.310 --> 10:12.210
I can't wait!

10:12.212 --> 10:14.980
All right, you go
to your friggin' room!

10:14.982 --> 10:19.184
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have to find a new hideout.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.889
Melissa?

10:24.891 --> 10:27.425
Melissa, you in here?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.995
MELISSA:
Take off your pants.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.429
What?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.231
Take off your pants.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.968
I'm wearing cargo shorts.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.837
Take off your cargo shorts.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.239
Why?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.875
(whispers):
We're gonna make a baby.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.144
Oh.

10:50.683 --> 10:51.683
Come again?

10:51.685 --> 10:53.118
We're gonna make a baby.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.353
You-you got a baby.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.455
This is a doll.
(scoffs)

10:57.457 --> 10:59.457
You're messing around, right?
Are you serious?

10:59.459 --> 11:02.027
Let me show you
how serious I am.
(stammers)

11:02.029 --> 11:04.863
Melissa, I can't do that.
I'm married to Carol.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.465
Carol was on board with you
getting me pregnant in Tucson.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.701
That was back
when I was a skunk, huh?

11:09.703 --> 11:12.971
And as I recall,
we dunked that skunk, didn't we?

11:12.973 --> 11:14.839
Okay. Bye. Get out.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.274
(stammers)
I want you to know

11:16.276 --> 11:18.009
I think you're a
very special lady.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.444
I know that you're
gonna find someone

11:19.446 --> 11:21.046
who makes you
very happy.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.814
Well, that was flattering.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.882
(chuckles)

11:38.898 --> 11:41.299
Drink too much.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.967
Please.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.903
Think about what I've done.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.205
Fine. Here's what I've done.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.408
I'll show you drinking too much.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.410
Just jealous
'cause you're pregnant.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.080
Oh, look whose eyes
are open now.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.748
Burn's on you, Mom.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.084
(ignition sputtering)

11:59.086 --> 12:02.153
(sighs) Come on.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.457
(sighs)

12:10.162 --> 12:12.230
(electronic dance music playing)

12:21.540 --> 12:23.541
Hey, T.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.543
You doing some
pop-and-lock therapy?

12:25.545 --> 12:27.112
Yeah.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.947
I talked to Melissa.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.515
Yeah, what'd she say?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.083
Have a seat.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.118
Okay.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.886
(music stops)

12:34.888 --> 12:36.354
(sighs)

12:38.257 --> 12:40.058
Look, I'm just gonna come
right out and say it,

12:40.060 --> 12:41.860
'cause honesty is
the language of buds.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.129
Yeah.

12:44.131 --> 12:47.232
Melissa tried to initiate
a pregnancy bone session.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.534
Yeah. And we're
talking immediate ask.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.536
Like, right when I
got into the room.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.271
It was almost aggressive.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.906
Like a dingo.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.374
I see.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.477
Hey, if it's any consolation,
I turned her down right away.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.313
If she's been with Todd,
I don't touch that bod.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.149
Say that all the time.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.152
Yeah, no, I-I know.
It's just... it's just weird.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.553
(snorts)
Not that weird.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.822
I mean, come on.
No, I mean,

13:10.824 --> 13:13.158
it's just weird to have her
go to you and Lewis

13:13.160 --> 13:14.325
to ask if you'd
impregnate her.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.162
I know, I know.
(stammers) Uh, uh...

13:17.164 --> 13:18.496
Lewis?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.498
Yeah, she did the same thing
with him.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.434
Oh, she did, now?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.603
Huh.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.839
Huh.
(exhales)

13:27.841 --> 13:31.843
And, uh, when'd she do that,
uh, roughly?

13:31.845 --> 13:32.844
I don't know.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.279
Earlier today.
But, uh,

13:34.281 --> 13:37.182
after she came to me, yes?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.616
Yes?
I-I... I don't know.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.452
(power whirring off, then on)

13:41.454 --> 13:43.188
What's going on?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.956
I know. I mean,
there's no way

13:44.958 --> 13:46.624
that she came to
Lewis first, right?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.626
No, I'm talking about
the lights, Tandy.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.495
Yeah, well, I am, uh,
talking about Melissa.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.298
So, wh-when did he come
to tell you about this?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.499
Tandy, I-I don't know.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.301
C-Can we please
stop talking about this?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.102
It's making me really sad, bud.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.271
Uh, yes. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I don't care.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.006
I mean, whatevs, right?

14:02.008 --> 14:04.008
I mean, who cares?
Probably Lewis.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.510
I don't care.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.611
(quietly): I don't care.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.113
I'm gonna go find Lewis.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.615
Do you know where he is?
No.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.684
Okay. Just unrelated.

14:16.989 --> 14:18.389
TANDY:
Care Bear.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.525
Care Bear,
can I ask you something?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.560
I'm-I'm kind of busy, Tandy.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.662
Melissa tried
to hit on me and Lewis.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.231
Oh. Uh-huh.
Unfortunately,

14:26.233 --> 14:27.899
it's not real clear, like,
who she approached first.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.134
Yeah, Tandy, can this wait?
But you just
don't want to get

14:30.136 --> 14:31.636
the facts wrong on something
like this, you know?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.238
I mean,
you got to know that order.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.041
(groans) Tandy, didn't you
hear me?! I said I'm busy!

14:37.043 --> 14:40.311
And when a lady needs her space,
she needs her space.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.548
Oh.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.916
What's up?

14:44.918 --> 14:46.384
Think I just learned my lesson.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.386
Okay.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.687
Sorry.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.223
I need
to apologize to Mom.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.459
Okay.

14:57.696 --> 15:02.700
This looks like a good place
for Mama's hideaway.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.502
(whirring)

15:08.040 --> 15:11.609
Hey, bud! Heard you were
getting in on the flight game.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.344
Yeah.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.180
Let me know if you,
uh, need any pointers.

15:16.182 --> 15:19.584
Uh, this isn't my first time
in a... in a plane front.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.952
Plane front?

15:20.954 --> 15:22.453
You know, the plane front,

15:22.455 --> 15:25.290
where the, uh, plane drivers
drive the plane.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.691
The cockpit?
Oh, cockpit.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.294
Yeah, uh, sure, yeah, I've heard
people call it that, too.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.696
Yeah, know it well.
Know it well.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.665
(elevator bell dings)

15:35.634 --> 15:37.035
Oh.
(elevator bell dings)

15:37.037 --> 15:38.036
Oh...

15:38.038 --> 15:39.604
(groans) Damn it.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.706
(elevator music playing)

15:41.708 --> 15:43.708
Heard that Melissa asked you
to be, uh, friends

15:43.710 --> 15:45.610
with paternal benefits, huh?

15:45.612 --> 15:46.611
Yeah.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.746
Anyway, she asked me, too.
Surprise, surprise.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.416
Uh, but just cur...
just, uh, curious, uh,

15:51.418 --> 15:54.285
whenabouts, uh...
whenabouts did she ask you?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.220
I don't know.
Around breakfast.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.589
Breakfast. Oh.
(chuckles)

15:58.591 --> 16:02.060
Are you, like, a-a breakfast
all day, uh, person?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.328
No, I eat breakfast
in the morning.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.629
Oh, you do. Okay.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.098
But, like, 11:59 a.m.
still qualifies

16:07.100 --> 16:09.767
as, uh, morning to some.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.502
I eat very early.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.504
Congratulations, my friend.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.639
(chuckles)

16:14.641 --> 16:16.341
(elevator bell dings)

16:16.343 --> 16:19.410
(sighs) Friggin' lobby.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.413
(elevator bell dings)

16:24.783 --> 16:26.851
(elevator thumps,
power whirring down)

16:32.491 --> 16:34.359
What the hell?

16:34.361 --> 16:38.296
Damn it. What is going on
with the power in this tower?

16:38.298 --> 16:41.499
I think we might
be overloading it.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.034
Oh, come on.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.437
Hey! Can anybody hear me?!

16:50.376 --> 16:52.443
Go, elevator!

16:52.445 --> 16:54.812
Go down!

16:54.814 --> 16:57.515
Help!

16:57.517 --> 17:00.284
Hey, can you hear me?!

17:00.286 --> 17:02.720
Yep. Overload.
Look at this.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.822
You see, we're running energy
into all five buildings

17:04.824 --> 17:06.691
in this complex.
Uh-huh.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.659
And we never use
those other buildings.

17:08.661 --> 17:09.794
So you see what I'm saying?

17:09.796 --> 17:12.497
Blow up the other
buildings, yeah?

17:12.499 --> 17:13.664
No.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.299
Shut off their power.

17:15.301 --> 17:16.401
Shut off their power.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.170
That way,
ours won't be so diluted.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.172
Won't be so diluted.
Won't be so diluted.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.673
Yeah, great minds, huh?
(chuckles)

17:22.675 --> 17:24.375
Starting to see what
Melissa saw in you.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.078
All right,
let's check the breakers

17:27.080 --> 17:28.746
and see which one is ours.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.083
(elevator music resumes)

17:32.085 --> 17:34.485
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, yes!

17:37.389 --> 17:39.223
That's not it.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.326
Oh! (chuckles)
That's the one.

17:42.328 --> 17:45.730
So we just use this one, and
all our power issues are solved.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.332
You are a genius, huh? Screw
the other buildings, right?

17:48.334 --> 17:49.434
Screw 'em.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.169
