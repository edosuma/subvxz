00:15.081 --> 00:18.121
People near the coast should evacuate immediately, houses
are collapsing

00:18.401 --> 00:20.321
Israel may bomb Iran.

00:20.601 --> 00:23.601
If I were Iran I would be trying to get nuclear weapons.

00:23.881 --> 00:27.801
America was the first nation ever, to use nuclear weapons.

00:28.801 --> 00:31.321
600 people are now confirmed dead,

00:31.601 --> 00:34.601
they died because they listened to the Governor.

00:34.881 --> 00:38.561
Who will help us already? We can not do anything!

00:40.161 --> 00:43.641
Does the dollar get destroyed or is every currency going to
get destroyed?

00:43.921 --> 00:46.721
A series of demonstrations against corporate greed

00:47.001 --> 00:49.121
Move! Keep moving please! Get out of the way!

00:49.401 --> 00:54.201
Civilians can be stopped on the street with very little actual
suspicious cause

00:58.001 --> 01:02.161
Do we fear China or do we need China?

01:02.441 --> 01:04.480
Because the extra low frequency waves

01:04.760 --> 01:06.401
drill deep into your brain.

01:06.681 --> 01:08.801
The sun has a temper tantrum.

01:09.081 --> 01:12.721
But it doesn't end there, if there were an electromagnetic
problem

01:13.001 --> 01:14.681
it could be the end of life as we know it.

01:14.961 --> 01:17.801
It is obvious why the world is so stressed and humanity
suffers as it does.

01:18.081 --> 01:20.401
And humanity suffers so much.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.521
If you look at what's circled in the centre you can see a smiley
face.

01:22.801 --> 01:26.721
Do we care? Do we have a moral compass anymore?

02:18.201 --> 02:19.961
I visualised Killing Joke

02:20.241 --> 02:23.561
before Killing Joke actually happened.

02:23.841 --> 02:25.361
There was a stage.

02:25.641 --> 02:30.481
An anonymous band emitting sounds of a primeval world;

02:30.761 --> 02:33.281
it was like a generator,

02:33.561 --> 02:37.361
and there was no applause, there was only dispersal,

02:37.641 --> 02:40.641
the musicians were like insects.

02:40.921 --> 02:43.721
LONDON

02:53.161 --> 02:56.801
I was standing in the dole queue about to sign on

02:57.081 --> 03:01.161
and there was this Indian guy in front of me, and he went"Hi,
my name's Carlos."

03:01.441 --> 03:04.481
and I said “Oh, my name's Jaz, I've come to London to form a
band?

03:04.761 --> 03:09.081
And he goes “I know, and I'm going to introduce you to the
drummer who lives in my house."

03:16.321 --> 03:18.561
I was already playing with a band,

03:18.841 --> 03:22.801
I met Jaz and invited him to join the group.

03:23.081 --> 03:26.081
But we both took off just before a concert.

03:26.361 --> 03:29.081
Which I'll eternally feel bad about

03:29.361 --> 03:34.721
but you know; needs must when the devil pees in your kettle.

03:35.001 --> 03:38.481
The second I set eyes on Paul's face,

03:38.761 --> 03:42.521
we both knew that destiny had struck us,

03:42.801 --> 03:44.801
It was kind <i>of...</i>

03:45.081 --> 03:47.361
mutual repulsion.

03:55.081 --> 03:58.601
We sort of discussed, well how are we going to meet

03:58.881 --> 04:03.761
two other guys who not only have a revolutionary style of
playing,

04:04.041 --> 04:06.721
but they also have a right side of brain capacity

04:07.001 --> 04:08.841
sufficiently developed

04:09.121 --> 04:15.041
to understand philosophy and broader ideas?

04:15.321 --> 04:17.560
Paul said

04:17.841 --> 04:19.680
..."Magick".

04:28.001 --> 04:31.081
At that time I didn't know, that Paul knew

04:31.361 --> 04:33.801
anything about Magick.

04:34.081 --> 04:37.441
He had extensive knowledge about the ceremonial Magick,

04:37.721 --> 04:40.321
and the Rosicrucians, the system of the Golden Dawn.

04:40.601 --> 04:44.481
He had a very good understanding of the Kabbalah, the
mystery traditions

04:44.761 --> 04:47.241
and the secret history of the world.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.361
By then, I had already studied Wicca

04:51.641 --> 04:53.281
and ceremonial Magick.

04:53.561 --> 04:57.761
When I discovered that he had followed the same path as me,

04:58.041 --> 05:00.081
"that was it"

05:00.361 --> 05:06.081
Our mutual interest in all things occult and spiritual

05:06.361 --> 05:09.761
made us think we could do something musically

05:10.041 --> 05:14.081
that channeled what we were exploring.

05:16.321 --> 05:21.001
On the 26th February, three o'clock, 1979

05:21.281 --> 05:25.881
Paul and I performed the ritual of dedication

05:26.161 --> 05:28.441
to find the other two.

05:28.721 --> 05:30.561
We painted the floor black,

05:30.841 --> 05:32.841
and drew the circle and the Pentagram,

05:33.121 --> 05:37.441
aligning it with the cardinal points, as one should do

05:37.721 --> 05:41.001
We did a banishing ritual, stated our intentions,

05:41.281 --> 05:42.681
did an invocation ritual

05:42.961 --> 05:45.201
It was somewhat amateurish and basic stuff

05:45.481 --> 05:49.721
but, apparently, it apparently turned out to be quite powerful

05:50.001 --> 05:55.361
Unknowingly, we invoke the fire and <i>er...</i>

05:55.681 --> 05:58.441
the flat burnt down!

06:01.681 --> 06:06.441
The flat got burnt down because they got their navigational
compass points wrong.

06:06.721 --> 06:10.521
They had not yet perfected their art at the time

06:12.441 --> 06:16.561
"Have you heard?They've burned your flat!"

06:20.281 --> 06:22.121
WANT TO BE PART OF THE KILLING JOKE

06:22.401 --> 06:24.001
BASS AND GUITARIST WANTED

06:24.281 --> 06:27.161
I'm not quite sure how they found Geordie. I think it was
through

06:27.441 --> 06:31.921
A Melody Maker ad, and I was found through a Melody Maker
ad.

06:32.201 --> 06:36.601
Geordie showed up. He had long, curly, ginger hair

06:36.881 --> 06:38.361
and a Northern attitude.

06:38.641 --> 06:43.921
This sort of, Teddy, yob, lout type character.

06:44.201 --> 06:47.761
You have to take into consideration what he said on the
phone to us;

06:48.041 --> 06:51.721
“I've never played with a band but I'm the best in the world”.

06:52.001 --> 06:54.721
And when I asked him “Well where have you been playing?"

06:55.001 --> 06:58.481
he went “In my bedroom at my Mum's place",

06:58.761 --> 07:01.041
It did not sound very good.

07:06.161 --> 07:09.281
When he plugged in, and he started playing,

07:09.561 --> 07:12.881
it was like fire from heaven...

07:17.041 --> 07:21.121
I knew it, I knew the sound,

07:21.401 --> 07:27.361
it was a complete sense of déjà vu, it was incredibly
emotional,

07:27.641 --> 07:30.641
and I was so, so excited.

07:31.641 --> 07:34.481
He came over to my bedsit in Earl's Court and he said

07:34.761 --> 07:38.321
"You'll have to come up to Cheltenham where the singer
lives, do an audition."

07:38.601 --> 07:43.081
Tempted him down there under the sort of premise of free
food and lodging.

07:43.801 --> 07:49.561
So we ended up all up in Cheltenham at Jaz's Mum's place
and Mr. C too, god rest his soul

07:49.841 --> 07:53.401
and booked the first rehearsal.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.921
Do you know I'd really love to know the date?

07:58.081 --> 08:01.041
You know it was just Jaz bashing around on this electric
piano

08:01.321 --> 08:04.401
and he had this sort of beret, a feather, he was a bit of a hippy
really.

08:04.681 --> 08:07.561
He denies this fervently, but he had a feather earring

08:07.841 --> 08:09.401
and I just thought that was really weird.

08:09.681 --> 08:14.041
The Youth in his swastika t-shirt and his fucking chain doing
the full Sid routine.

08:14.321 --> 08:16.881
It was just sort of, ”Oh, oh it's him"!

08:17.161 --> 08:21.001
I was the most really experienced in the real world,

08:21.281 --> 08:24.321
because I'd done tours with other bands and I'd done proper
gigs

08:24.601 --> 08:28.721
and they'd never played outside their bloody youth club
basically.

08:29.001 --> 08:31.121
I think he was trying to avoid something

08:31.401 --> 08:35.441
something or trying to find somewhere to live or something
like that you know?

08:35.721 --> 08:38.241
And he was just there.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.201
We played a bit and Jaz and Paul commented:

08:41.481 --> 08:43.921
“Let's go to the pub and talk about this.”

08:44.201 --> 08:46.401
I don't think they were very impressed.

08:46.681 --> 08:50.041
Youth couldn't play he fucking choked.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.841
“Come on, Jesus Christ, you've got to. . ."and we just

08:53.121 --> 08:57.481
ended up fucking finding one note and fucking staying on it.

08:57.761 --> 09:00.481
And it went on for ages and got more and more intense

09:00.761 --> 09:03.161
Jaz and Paul walked in on it.

09:03.441 --> 09:05.881
We'd had enough to drink and it was like, "Well, shall we?"

09:06.161 --> 09:08.481
Perhaps the beer had worked it's magic but,

09:08.761 --> 09:13.001
it wasn't the same room that we'd left.

09:13.281 --> 09:16.201
Paul just went straight for the kit and started playing,

09:16.481 --> 09:19.241
and then Jaz just started playing and that became

09:19.521 --> 09:21.841
"Are You Receiving", our first single.

09:27.521 --> 09:30.801
I considered that point the birth of the band, that was it.

09:31.081 --> 09:34.561
When the chemistry comes together, when the planets
collide, you know?

09:34.841 --> 09:37.321
It ain't a fucking set up this shit

09:45.401 --> 09:49.281
Shrewdly I think we spent almost a year rehearsing in
Cheltenham before

09:49.561 --> 09:51.761
we unleashed ourselves.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.921
I think within seventeen gigs

09:54.201 --> 09:57.361
we were headlining at the Lyceum.

10:03.841 --> 10:08.481
Needless to say, these two great souls that manifested

10:08.761 --> 10:11.761
were Geordie and Youth.The Magick had worked.

10:13.921 --> 10:16.841
"Pssyche", this was a John Peel session, in November

10:17.121 --> 10:19.241
1979.

10:19.521 --> 10:21.401
That was a few years ago!

10:21.681 --> 10:24.801
John Peel said: "This is a good band."

10:25.081 --> 10:28.041
He thought it was a professional band having him on

10:28.321 --> 10:30.961
He said: "I have never had a band as good as this."

10:31.241 --> 10:32.721
It was for "Turn To Red".

10:35.521 --> 10:40.241
Killing Joke are good. Good punk. Not commercial.

10:40.521 --> 10:43.641
A lot of bands nowadays have gone crap commercial.

10:43.921 --> 10:47.361
We'd come through all these punk bands who were really
good to go and see live,

10:47.641 --> 10:50.601
but they couldn't play for fuck. Bands like Eater and...

10:50.881 --> 10:52.001
The Clash were around,

10:52.281 --> 10:55.401
but were just a pretend rock 'n' roll band dressed up as punks,

10:55.681 --> 10:58.801
and The Sex Pistols had almost disintegrated by then.

10:59.081 --> 11:02.761
But then Killing Joke, it wasn't just screaming and shouting

11:03.041 --> 11:05.921
and... They could actually really play.

11:06.201 --> 11:08.641
We like rhythm, you know. . .?

11:09.481 --> 11:10.921
Rhythm, you understand?

11:11.201 --> 11:15.001
Because it makes me feel... Rhythm makes me feel like I'm a
human being,

11:15.281 --> 11:17.281
like I'm an animal, you understand?

11:21.561 --> 11:25.321
I saw them for the first time in 1981, I was 16 years old...

11:25.601 --> 11:29.041
No other group has made me feel the same.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.721
It was like an electric shock going through me.

11:39.761 --> 11:43.161
When I actually saw them play it was incredible.

11:43.441 --> 11:47.241
You could cut the atmosphere with a knife it was really... And
it was a real tribal thing,

11:47.521 --> 11:50.241
they were giving out to the audience, the audience were
giving back...

11:50.521 --> 11:52.841
and it had this air of menace to it which you know,

11:53.121 --> 11:55.921
I love that in music: menace and danger.

11:56.201 --> 11:59.281
I know they're terms that are used a lot in music

11:59.561 --> 12:01.921
but believe me it was really there.

12:07.721 --> 12:09.481
Jaz would come on in full make-up

12:09.801 --> 12:12.441
and you didn't know whether to laugh or to be totally afraid

12:12.721 --> 12:14.361
because he kind of looked like the Devil...

12:14.641 --> 12:17.521
...but it was slightly perverse and a bit strange and almost
silly.

12:17.801 --> 12:22.761
Nothing like that scares me I'm from Salford; who gives a fuck
about the Devil?

12:29.961 --> 12:33.081
He wasn't comfortable being the singer, he didn't want to be,

12:33.361 --> 12:36.081
he wanted to be the keyboard player and we had arguments
about it.

12:36.361 --> 12:42.001
I had a voice, but, playing the drums and being the singer, it
looks really bad

12:42.281 --> 12:44.801
it was never going to go anywhere!

12:45.081 --> 12:48.681
So he is the reluctant frontman of the band.

12:56.761 --> 13:00.241
You have a sort of, very mixed image I think, certainly in the
band,

13:00.521 --> 13:03.841
from your sort of Alvin Lee rocker type hairstyle

13:04.121 --> 13:09.801
to this Sid Vicious twisted hair, how does that arise?

13:10.081 --> 13:11.881
Well it's always been like this,

13:12.161 --> 13:16.961
we don't consider ourselves to be anything other than
individuals.

13:17.241 --> 13:20.041
We have our own personal likes and dislikes,

13:20.321 --> 13:21.641
and out of this somehow

13:21.921 --> 13:25.441
we coalesce into something called Killing Joke.

13:25.761 --> 13:29.521
Paul never seemed to be thrashing away you know, he wasn't
Keith Moon <i>or...</i>

13:29.801 --> 13:32.881
It was just quite controlled but, huge power.

13:33.161 --> 13:35.201
If he looked at me I thought he'd... hit me you know

13:35.481 --> 13:38.721
He had me on the edge of my pants, I had to keep up with
him

13:39.001 --> 13:43.321
and, not make him look silly. He made me into a good player.

13:49.321 --> 13:52.961
You're certainly more on the, the art, sort of University
circuit...

13:53.241 --> 13:54.361
No that's rubbish,

13:54.641 --> 13:57.601
there's nut-cases at our gigs,

13:57.881 --> 13:58.921
Why?

13:59.201 --> 14:03.801
They're the only sort of honest people, you know, they
haven't got any pretense about them you know?

14:33.961 --> 14:36.041
I just thought, this is what music should be,

14:36.321 --> 14:39.681
it's just like being hit in the face by a train.

14:41.121 --> 14:44.761
When I joined I was the one who wasn't really into the occult
and the Magick

14:45.041 --> 14:48.561
I was a really arrogant, conceited, young punk,

14:48.841 --> 14:51.001
who thought he knew everything?

14:51.281 --> 14:54.521
And suddenly I was totally flung

14:54.801 --> 14:58.081
into this hermetic, occult, mystical world

14:58.361 --> 15:05.001
of possibilities and realities, of which I'd never been aware of
before

15:05.281 --> 15:08.561
and I did blow a few fuses.

15:13.681 --> 15:17.921
When they first came in they were a cocky bunch of guys,
really.

15:18.201 --> 15:19.721
They'd come in as a pack

15:20.001 --> 15:23.121
and then after a while I found out that they were this band
called Killing Joke,

15:23.401 --> 15:25.041
which meant nothing to me at the time.

15:25.321 --> 15:28.481
I heard a bit of their music and it fitted.

15:30.081 --> 15:32.801
Looking at the times that I grew up,

15:33.081 --> 15:36.161
the hippy dream had started to get a bit nasty,

15:36.441 --> 15:40.361
people started dropping acid, went to various gurus

15:40.641 --> 15:43.601
and Eastern philosophy and everything;

15:43.881 --> 15:48.241
It was all starting to eat itself, with the Manson stuff...

15:48.521 --> 15:51.721
And I think that's sort of culturally

15:52.001 --> 15:54.721
when people started looking at mysticism,

15:55.001 --> 15:58.041
and perhaps Aleister Crowley and all that sort of thing,

15:58.321 --> 16:03.121
for their, you know, new experience of the enlightenment

16:03.401 --> 16:06.761
that hippiedom had promised them.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.721
Prepare to enter a world

16:11.001 --> 16:13.961
stranger than you have ever imagined:

16:14.241 --> 16:18.801
The world of witchcraft, Magick and ritual.

16:20.161 --> 16:23.601
It was very much a time for throwing away the rules,

16:23.881 --> 16:27.121
you were considered terribly staid and unnecessarily stupid

16:27.401 --> 16:31.561
if you did it the way round that people have been doing it for
a hundred years, four hundred years, whatever.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.761
And so you just launched yourself into

16:34.041 --> 16:37.001
whatever particular ritual you wanted to do at the time,

16:37.281 --> 16:39.121
and you were prepared to take the consequences

16:39.401 --> 16:43.721
because all men think that they're going to live fast and die
young and what the hell.

16:44.721 --> 16:47.961
We call to the Earth.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.721
We call to the sky.

16:52.001 --> 16:54.641
Mother father.

16:54.921 --> 16:57.961
We were shamanistic, generally speaking,

16:58.241 --> 17:02.121
and devotional, which was Geordie and myself
predominantly.

17:02.401 --> 17:04.521
We would celebrate the moons to get,

17:04.800 --> 17:07.161
our actions aligned with

17:07.441 --> 17:10.441
the seasons of mother nature.

17:11.161 --> 17:14.121
Paul was actually the ceremonial one.

17:14.441 --> 17:18.521
I grew up listening to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.601
What you going to do, what's that all about?

17:22.320 --> 17:25.121
There's no doubt about the fact that your overall beliefs,

17:25.401 --> 17:29.321
no matter what they are, are going to underlie what you're
doing.

17:30.401 --> 17:34.681
I do not know collectively, but as far as Jaz goes

17:34.961 --> 17:38.841
I know that mysticism played a very important role to him.

17:41.361 --> 17:45.161
Within the music, he's either playing with Magick

17:45.441 --> 17:48.241
or Magick's playing with him.

17:52.521 --> 17:56.001
What was apparent about him was that he was a doer, he's an
experimenter,

17:56.281 --> 17:59.521
he doesn't just accept what he's told.

17:59.841 --> 18:04.121
We used to take the car and go to the Rollright Stones in
Oxford.

18:04.401 --> 18:07.721
Sometimes at very important dates, you know, like Solstice.

18:08.001 --> 18:10.881
I was even starting to be scared to be perhaps sacrificed,

18:11.161 --> 18:14.561
and I was keeping a very low profile, disappearing into the
forest or something!

18:14.841 --> 18:17.641
And let them do their ritual in the middle of the circle.

18:17.921 --> 18:21.001
We would use drum and mantra.

18:21.281 --> 18:23.041
I would take my ocarinas

18:23.321 --> 18:26.361
and I would move in a clockwise direction

18:26.641 --> 18:30.641
in a spiral dance around the stone circle

18:36.721 --> 18:40.921
We became adept at raising energy at these grid

18:41.201 --> 18:44.961
points, we became really, really good,

18:45.241 --> 18:48.561
we could activate these grid points

18:51.881 --> 18:54.841
There was so much symbolism and so many things I thought:

18:55.121 --> 18:57.201
oh my God, perhaps I'm going to die!

19:03.921 --> 19:07.001
And of course this technique was sort of employed

19:07.281 --> 19:11.241
within raising the energy live on stage.

19:12.001 --> 19:15.321
And eventually the two became one,

19:15.601 --> 19:17.881
the gigs became

19:18.161 --> 19:20.521
...ceremonies.

19:20.801 --> 19:23.401
And then we did it on a grid point,

19:23.681 --> 19:25.361
by accident,

19:25.641 --> 19:27.721
and time was transcended.

19:32.041 --> 19:35.041
Reading Hexagon. Mad fucking gig, and suddenly...

19:35.321 --> 19:39.401
about five songs <i>in...</i>

19:42.161 --> 19:45.001
it's gone silent, totally fucking silent.

19:45.281 --> 19:47.081
You just heard this, “khhhhhhhh”.

19:47.361 --> 19:51.721
And before this it was just screaming madness.

19:52.001 --> 19:54.361
Everything seemed to move in slow motion.

19:54.641 --> 19:56.881
And I'd be looking at Geordie

19:58.721 --> 20:01.641
Everything was slowing down.

20:03.481 --> 20:08.081
I'm playing the fucking guitar... What the fuck? I can't hear
anything.

20:08.801 --> 20:11.721
And I'm witnessing this body playing,

20:12.001 --> 20:15.481
I'm getting scared, so I look over to Jaz,

20:15.761 --> 20:19.201
and he's on the keyboard, and he's doing exactly the same;

20:19.481 --> 20:22.881
“what the fuck's going on?"

20:23.161 --> 20:25.881
I had no idea what was going on.

20:26.161 --> 20:27.841
Total silence.

20:28.121 --> 20:30.361
Total. Fucking. Silence

20:35.241 --> 20:39.401
I'd look at the audience and they're all like, “Woah? What's
going on?"

20:42.841 --> 20:46.001
It became an out of body experience.

20:56.161 --> 20:58.801
We're very fucking clever aren't we? We did this man,

20:59.081 --> 21:01.601
we fucking got it to this stage:

21:01.881 --> 21:05.641
God walks through the fucking room.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.081
And then suddenly; Whoosh

21:30.321 --> 21:34.361
BANG! Back into super-reality of the place going insane.

21:40.121 --> 21:42.521
Could have been thirty seconds, could have been forty
seconds,

21:42.801 --> 21:45.441
but it was paradise for fucking forty seconds

21:45.721 --> 21:47.801
It was the most incredible experience

21:48.081 --> 21:50.321
and we experienced it collectively...

21:50.601 --> 21:53.521
and everybody shit themselves.

21:56.681 --> 21:59.841
The other thing in the early days with Killing Joke was the...

22:00.121 --> 22:04.361
the actual Killing Joke as a unit.

22:04.641 --> 22:07.041
The minute the four of them got together,

22:07.321 --> 22:09.281
it was a complete personality change.

22:09.561 --> 22:12.801
This wasn't Paul Ferguson, this wasn't Jaz Coleman,

22:13.081 --> 22:14.201
this was Killing Joke,

22:14.481 --> 22:17.601
and that's when the aggro over the artwork would start.

22:18.921 --> 22:22.281
It was just chalk and cheese, they'd want something I'd want
something else,

22:22.561 --> 22:26.161
and I'd do something and we'd fight and whoever got the last
word...

22:26.441 --> 22:30.881
I mean I totally fucked up the sleeve to 'What's THIS For. . .!'
on purpose.

22:31.161 --> 22:33.441
Paul Ferguson said "Oh we want that for the album,

22:33.721 --> 22:34.841
that's going to be brilliant."

22:35.121 --> 22:38.641
I said “Well I haven't finished doing what I was doing with it."

22:38.921 --> 22:40.561
I just got really angry,

22:40.841 --> 22:45.121
and threw some films together and said you go on and
fucking print that then you bastards.

22:51.641 --> 22:55.481
WHAT'S THIS FOR. . .! IS THE WALKING, TALKING,
INCARNATION OF EVIL

22:55.761 --> 23:00.961
Sounds gave it five stars for music, and one star for morals!

23:01.241 --> 23:02.961
And I've never seen that before or since.

23:03.241 --> 23:07.281
The guy was freaked out, and he felt obliged to put a warning
in,

23:07.561 --> 23:11.481
that it could corrode you spiritually!

23:23.681 --> 23:27.521
Killing Joke is best explained in your emotions;

23:28.721 --> 23:32.321
in the eyes, in the mouth, in the emotions you see?

23:32.601 --> 23:36.561
See, we try to be human beings in Killing Joke that's all.

23:37.961 --> 23:39.681
Killing Joke were not a polite band,

23:39.961 --> 23:44.641
they really don't say things just to please you I mean... They
were really raw.

23:57.201 --> 24:00.921
Hammersmith Palais, February 23, 1982.

24:01.201 --> 24:04.361
A French television team was there so it was really organised.

24:04.641 --> 24:09.681
I'd been doing the interview before, I was trying to talk about
occultism,

24:09.961 --> 24:13.041
but Jaz said: "I do not know what you mean."

24:23.521 --> 24:28.161
They had these huge studio TV cameras in the middle of the
dance floor,

24:28.441 --> 24:30.841
and the whole thing collapsed with the weight of the fans.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.801
I remember being terrified because I was down the front,

24:34.081 --> 24:37.361
and I remember just bodies falling and bodies flying around
me,

24:37.641 --> 24:40.161
the bouncers trying to pull people out

24:40.481 --> 24:42.801
and shouting “Stop playing! Stop playing!”

24:43.081 --> 24:46.041
And I remember Jaz looking at this chaos at the front

24:46.321 --> 24:49.681
and just went “Wardance!” and then they went straight into
'Wardance'!

24:56.441 --> 24:58.481
And it was just like a scene from

24:58.761 --> 25:02.721
Dante's Inferno down the front and they weren't going to
stop playing!

25:34.801 --> 25:37.521
I think he was really pleased to be filmed that day.

25:37.801 --> 25:40.201
It was going to be shown on French television on a Saturday,

25:40.481 --> 25:43.361
so twenty million people are going to see Killing Joke.

25:46.761 --> 25:51.201
Western civilisation, I give it, twenty months

25:51.481 --> 25:54.081
and it'll be gone, all gone; bang!

26:00.881 --> 26:04.361
SINGER VANISHES

26:10.481 --> 26:11.761
SINGER (?),

26:12.041 --> 26:13.401
KEYBOARD WIZARD, AND ALL ROUND POISON DWARF

26:13.681 --> 26:14.961
JAZ HAS GONE AWOL... PRESUMED DISTURBED.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.881
Jaz had a Wobbler, he basically thought that the end was
nigh.

26:19.161 --> 26:22.561
He went on one of his birthdays I even made him a cake and
he disappeared.

26:22.841 --> 26:24.001
JAZ VANISHES

26:24.281 --> 26:27.801
We were standing outside a television studio, we were
supposed to go on

26:28.081 --> 26:30.521
and this sort of letter showed up, you know,

26:30.801 --> 26:32.201
saying <i>"599</i> Ya!"

26:32.481 --> 26:34.361
“Where is Jaz Coleman?”

26:34.641 --> 26:35.481
And they phoned me up and I wouldn't tell them.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.361
<i>JAZ... IS ALIVE...</i> AND <i>WELL...</i>

26:38.681 --> 26:40.641
LIVING IN ICELAND

26:40.921 --> 26:44.521
Punk star goes nuts runs off to Iceland; great story.

26:44.801 --> 26:47.081
We learned that he had fled to Iceland.

26:47.361 --> 26:50.241
And did anyone give a fuck...?

26:50.521 --> 26:52.081
No.

26:52.361 --> 26:57.001
I fled myself a couple of times, never made it to Iceland but I
made it to the Isle of Wight once,

26:57.281 --> 26:59.681
realised what a shithole it was and came home.

26:59.961 --> 27:02.401
JAZ SPEAKS: "Fuck You!"

27:02.681 --> 27:05.321
JAZ IS STILL REFUSING TO EXPLAIN WHY HE LEFT THE BAND
IN THE LURCH

27:05.601 --> 27:08.681
HIS RESPONSE WAS A CURT "FUCK OFF"

27:10.041 --> 27:14.161
And that was when I left the band, or when the band left me!

27:14.441 --> 27:19.641
<i>Because first 3217. went, and then Geordie</i>

27:22.081 --> 27:27.361
I was sitting in my flat, and I felt something behind me.

27:27.641 --> 27:31.601
But I didn't turn round, I deliberately ignored it.

27:31.881 --> 27:35.521
That thing that I felt was actually Geordie leaving,

27:35.801 --> 27:40.361
It was Geordie out the front door, because we lived together.

27:40.641 --> 27:43.601
Silently and stealthily, like a snake,

27:43.881 --> 27:46.681
They took off without leaving me a note.

27:46.961 --> 27:49.241
And with Jaz I was particularly upset

27:49.521 --> 27:52.121
because I had to read about it in the bloody NME.

27:52.401 --> 27:54.001
I'd known these guys four or five years,

27:54.281 --> 27:56.761
gone through some serious rights of passage with them

27:57.041 --> 27:58.801
and they can't even give me the time of day.

27:59.081 --> 28:00.721
Well I don't know what happened in Iceland

28:01.001 --> 28:04.281
because I had to go out and work in the Middle East,

28:04.561 --> 28:08.441
I was skint because I didn't get any money out of Killing Joke
or Malicious Damage!

28:08.721 --> 28:13.881
I'm not sure that it went very well for them over there.

28:14.161 --> 28:19.281
ICELAND

28:22.321 --> 28:24.801
Jaz told me that he had read and article

28:25.081 --> 28:28.841
about what would be the safest place in the world if there
was a nuclear war...

28:29.121 --> 28:32.361
...and in that article it said the north east of Iceland.

28:32.641 --> 28:36.041
Another thing was that he was the reincarnation of Aleister
Crowley.

28:36.321 --> 28:39.281
I think he was the third or the fourth one that I've met.

28:39.561 --> 28:43.921
There is a sentence in the Book of the Law which says
“Choose ye an island and fortify it!"

28:44.201 --> 28:45.441
and things like that.

28:45.721 --> 28:49.601
“Island" is written the same way that we write “Iceland” in
Icelandic,

28:49.881 --> 28:52.121
that was also a connecting point,

28:52.401 --> 28:54.441
I think he sincerely believed that.

28:54.721 --> 29:00.521
The thing about the Book of the Law is that Crowley
channelled it in 1904

29:00.801 --> 29:04.601
and he spent the rest of his life trying to decode it.

29:04.881 --> 29:08.841
Because of its complexity, it is open to interpretation.

29:09.121 --> 29:13.481
I mean at one time I had a moated site in Sussex

29:13.761 --> 29:16.841
and I thought that was the island!

29:17.121 --> 29:22.481
It's your application to your, you know, your Magickal destiny.

29:26.881 --> 29:30.041
I found many references,

29:30.321 --> 29:32.441
Prophetic references,

29:32.721 --> 29:37.121
describing a better way of life,

29:37.441 --> 29:43.281
an island that survives the great upheaval.

29:59.721 --> 30:02.601
The interesting thing was;

30:02.881 --> 30:05.921
all the references I discovered,

30:06.241 --> 30:10.241
were nearly all by Rosicrucian authors.

30:13.481 --> 30:16.921
At the centre of the Golden Dawn system of Magick

30:17.201 --> 30:20.721
lies the invocation of the holy guardian angel;

30:21.001 --> 30:23.241
an ecstatic mystical process

30:23.521 --> 30:28.441
that fascinated the chiefs and leading members of the
Golden Dawn.

30:28.721 --> 30:32.721
Individuation, in Jungian terms,

30:33.001 --> 30:36.241
is about tapping into the unconscious.

30:36.521 --> 30:39.721
Each of us has a dark double,

30:40.001 --> 30:42.401
an adversary that we must face.

30:42.681 --> 30:45.601
And until we know this double

30:45.881 --> 30:48.081
we do not know ourselves.

30:48.361 --> 30:52.841
So I decided to go through this process.

30:56.441 --> 31:01.641
Apart from Geordie, no one was really aware of my intentions,

31:01.921 --> 31:04.001
I couldn't honestly imagine sitting down

31:04.281 --> 31:06.281
with the band and management

31:06.561 --> 31:11.401
explaining why I wanted to study a range of different
subjects, from Nordic mythology

31:11.681 --> 31:16.241
to the study of radiations that emanate from certain holy
sites,

31:16.521 --> 31:21.121
let alone the location of my holy guardian angel.

31:21.401 --> 31:26.601
So, I made plans in secret and left for Iceland,

31:26.881 --> 31:31.321
and then, I began the process of individuation

31:31.601 --> 31:34.521
at Snaefellsjökull Glacier.

31:44.121 --> 31:45.961
This is special!

31:46.761 --> 31:48.721
There are many people who believe

31:49.001 --> 31:52.161
that there is some special power in the glacier...

31:52.441 --> 31:56.681
I believe that also, there's some power up there I can feel it
myself.

31:56.961 --> 31:58.441
It's an energy spot.

31:58.721 --> 32:02.481
The energy is intense, is not good or bad, is pure energy.

32:02.761 --> 32:04.841
It amplifies whatever is there

32:05.121 --> 32:07.561
so if you're an evil person you'll be a more evil person if your
standing there

32:07.841 --> 32:10.801
and if you're good, you'll be even better.

32:12.601 --> 32:16.001
I remember we went to the glacier.

32:16.281 --> 32:18.601
It was the right night, the right moon...

32:18.881 --> 32:21.601
We were walking for two or three hours,

32:21.881 --> 32:24.321
when we get up to the snow...

32:24.601 --> 32:26.801
It suddenly got warmer and misty-er,

32:27.081 --> 32:30.801
it was like we were welcomed you know, the mountain was in
control.

32:31.081 --> 32:35.561
They were very happy to be there, and they started
dancing...

32:35.841 --> 32:39.921
Jaz was not walking anymore and it was beyond fucking
doubt

32:40.201 --> 32:42.921
he was levitating, he was about two foot off the ground,

32:43.201 --> 32:45.441
quite fucking surreal.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.081
It is a strange place.

32:55.361 --> 32:58.161
The elements change, the vibrations change,

32:58.441 --> 33:02.121
your physical body disappears or appears.

33:12.361 --> 33:15.281
The energy of that fucking place was. <i>..</i>

33:15.561 --> 33:19.361
I wouldn't say intense it was just fucking freedom,

33:19.641 --> 33:21.961
absolute fucking freedom.

33:26.601 --> 33:30.121
There was a rumour from Iceland that they were messing

33:30.401 --> 33:33.721
around with a weird sound machine that vibrated...

33:34.001 --> 33:36.841
Brian reckons that they rang him up and tried

33:37.121 --> 33:40.401
to do something to him over the phone once.

33:40.681 --> 33:42.841
The theory of the walls of Jericho.

33:43.121 --> 33:46.081
And you can actually do deep enough sound

33:46.361 --> 33:48.001
sound and it will shake walls and bring down buildings

33:48.281 --> 33:51.521
but you know, that's just fucking weird rumours.

33:56.641 --> 34:00.281
I took part in something called Oracle Project.

34:00.561 --> 34:04.521
A certain number of geomancers who got together.

34:04.801 --> 34:09.440
Experiments were conducted on human behaviour

34:09.721 --> 34:11.161
by means of resonance,

34:11.440 --> 34:15.041
this was done with a gentleman called Gutti Ottarsson,

34:15.321 --> 34:20.481
open-minded inventor, who also happened to be a musician.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.601
Jaz joins forces with the Icelandic band 'Theyr'

34:29.880 --> 34:32.601
Theyr and Jaz are planning to work on a concept called (you
guessed it) "Iceland"

34:32.880 --> 34:35.561
The Band Iceland-Niceland, Jaz Coleman and Theyr

34:35.841 --> 34:39.281
it was a very intense, small group of people.

34:39.561 --> 34:44.920
We wanted our music to break through your defense
mechanism;

34:45.201 --> 34:49.241
we went to great lengths to encode messages

34:49.521 --> 34:52.681
into the structure of our music in very subtle ways.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.801
One element that was very dominant

34:55.081 --> 34:57.641
in the music of Theyr and Killing Joke

34:57.921 --> 35:01.121
was the strange intervals we used.

35:01.401 --> 35:04.321
We were not using minors or majors,

35:04.601 --> 35:08.481
we were doing diabolic intervals,

35:08.761 --> 35:10.041
very dissonant,

35:10.321 --> 35:13.401
but if you put all the dissonance and the demons together,

35:13.681 --> 35:16.201
they turn into angels.

35:18.321 --> 35:19.481
Very simple,

35:19.761 --> 35:22.721
but it breaks all the rules;

35:23.001 --> 35:24.761
that was Jaz Coleman.

35:31.001 --> 35:33.681
Break all the rules,

35:35.441 --> 35:37.761
collect all the demons

35:38.041 --> 35:42.041
from music, throughout five thousand years

35:42.321 --> 35:45.401
and put them together in one song.

35:55.681 --> 35:58.961
Gutti was interested in developing a prototype

35:59.241 --> 36:02.721
to create mood changes within the perimeter of a concert,

36:03.001 --> 36:08.281
however my interests lied firmly in researching the Earth's
pulse rate

36:08.561 --> 36:10.121
of 7.83Hz

36:10.401 --> 36:13.361
which I considered would be more prevalent in sacred sites.

36:13.641 --> 36:16.801
I could see a correlation between healing in such areas

36:17.081 --> 36:21.481
by gradually adjusting the Earth's pulse rate by chant,
mantra,

36:21.761 --> 36:25.241
in order to accomplish quantum healing.

36:27.601 --> 36:32.601
And so, I embarked upon a series of experiments

36:32.881 --> 36:36.481
with two of my colleagues at the Oracle Project.

36:36.761 --> 36:39.801
Sarah Parkinson...

36:40.081 --> 36:42.441
was a student of the occult,

36:42.721 --> 36:47.121
and I met her in Cheltenham when I was eighteen.

36:47.401 --> 36:51.121
And then there was Vivan Ottisdottir,

36:51.401 --> 36:53.761
Gutti's sister.

37:03.761 --> 37:07.961
I see the Earth rising a second time,

37:08.241 --> 37:11.681
out of the foam, fair and green.

37:11.961 --> 37:16.001
Down from the fells, fish to capture,

37:16.801 --> 37:20.681
wings to eagle, waters flow.

37:21.801 --> 37:26.081
We repeated these four lines over and over again,

37:26.361 --> 37:29.921
until we entered another dimension.

37:31.121 --> 37:34.721
We called it "Universe B".

37:35.001 --> 37:38.401
I see the Earth rising a second time,

37:38.681 --> 37:41.601
out of the foam, fair and green.

37:41.881 --> 37:45.041
Down from the fells, fish to capture,

37:46.041 --> 37:49.921
wings to eagle, waters flow.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.161
The experiences

37:52.441 --> 37:55.081
were of such intensity

37:55.361 --> 37:59.841
that past and future seemed to be transcended;

38:00.121 --> 38:04.641
we would not actually be in our own bodies.

38:08.881 --> 38:12.801
There were many strange incidences

38:13.081 --> 38:16.641
during this series of experiments,

38:16.921 --> 38:20.521
one of which was when Vivan

38:21.401 --> 38:23.921
was struck by lightning.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.521
We were in the kitchen,

38:29.801 --> 38:32.121
the window was wide open

38:32.401 --> 38:35.881
and I just witnessed this huge lightning...

38:36.161 --> 38:38.881
...and this screaming from Vivan, hysterical screaming.

38:39.161 --> 38:42.521
I turned back to Vivan and Jaz and shejust...

38:44.201 --> 38:46.801
Yes, she was

38:47.081 --> 38:48.761
freaked out.

38:49.041 --> 38:50.721
He showed me her hand

38:51.001 --> 38:53.321
and it was all swollen and red,

38:53.601 --> 38:54.961
Yes. No...

38:55.241 --> 39:00.761
How can someone survive from being hit by lightning?

39:04.641 --> 39:09.881
My sister got struck by lightning two times

39:10.161 --> 39:13.001
in Jaz Coleman's company.

39:13.281 --> 39:16.041
The second time was more dramatic.

39:16.321 --> 39:19.521
Lightning striking all over the place, thunder and rain,

39:19.801 --> 39:22.521
Magick was in the air, Aleister Crowley and books

39:22.801 --> 39:24.761
everybody was crazy.

39:25.041 --> 39:28.921
She was soaking wet, standing out on the balcony

39:29.201 --> 39:33.521
confronting Jaz Coleman on personal matters.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.561
She was so lucky, she was protected, she was soaking wet

39:39.841 --> 39:42.441
...so the millions of volts of

39:42.721 --> 39:47.401
energy just slid around her

39:47.681 --> 39:54.001
wet, ...smooth body, to the ground.

39:54.281 --> 39:58.081
She was unharmed, not even knocked out

39:58.401 --> 40:01.281
So our dear Mr Coleman really

40:01.561 --> 40:05.641
recognized my sister as a divine being.

40:13.081 --> 40:16.001
Iceland was a series of experiments,

40:16.281 --> 40:20.041
a period of such exquisite beauty

40:20.321 --> 40:25.681
that I've spent the last twenty seven years

40:28.041 --> 40:30.641
trying to access

40:31.481 --> 40:35.201
the dimensions that I visited.

40:45.681 --> 40:48.641
It's an emotive subject,

40:48.921 --> 40:53.601
not least for the fact that Sarah and Vivan are both dead.

40:57.841 --> 41:01.041
I did meet Sarah and Vivan later on

41:01.321 --> 41:04.161
and I noticed a curious parallel.

41:05.881 --> 41:09.081
After meeting Vivan in Geneva

41:09.361 --> 41:13.321
she confided in me that the rituals we performed

41:13.601 --> 41:17.681
were one of the most beautiful experiences of her life.

41:17.961 --> 41:22.521
And Sarah, she admitted much the same.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.641
I was left with the feeling that both Sarah and Vivan,

41:26.921 --> 41:30.201
had little interest in the mundane concerns of the world
around them shortly

41:30.481 --> 41:34.081
before their respective deaths.

41:36.321 --> 41:39.961
It was almost as if they personified a profound nostalgia

41:40.241 --> 41:42.961
for a vaguely sensed lost paradise,

41:43.241 --> 41:45.481
both possessing the single urge;

41:45.761 --> 41:50.161
to abandon their earthly existence for their true home.

41:58.201 --> 42:02.681
Time to sit back once again and enjoy the sounds of Killing
Joke

42:13.121 --> 42:14.801
By the time Iceland came along I'd had

42:15.081 --> 42:17.721
a breakdown because I'd been taking quite a lot of LSD.

42:18.001 --> 42:22.041
I started to get very paranoid, see conspiracies everywhere,

42:22.321 --> 42:24.041
and I even broke into the Grand

42:24.321 --> 42:28.041
Lodge of the Masons of the Masons in Covent Garden

42:28.321 --> 42:32.641
We went through a few weeks of trying to find a replacement,

42:32.921 --> 42:36.321
it was just pointless, you know, I mean...

42:36.601 --> 42:39.281
And how. . .?

42:39.561 --> 42:41.041
For what purpose?

42:41.321 --> 42:42.841
SO WHAT? TWO FUCKING BASTARDS LEFT!

42:43.121 --> 42:44.921
FUCK OFF!

42:47.041 --> 42:51.161
I do remember they were on Top of the Pops, well, he wasn't
on Top of the Pops,

42:51.441 --> 42:55.001
it was a man with a motorbike helmet on playing the
keyboards.

42:55.281 --> 43:00.401
I was going to say because they did that when Jaz was just
like this dummy, as in it wasn't a person it was just a dummy.

43:00.681 --> 43:01.841
Yes

43:04.481 --> 43:07.681
Well I wasn't even that pissed off, I mean to be honest, I was
sad,

43:07.961 --> 43:11.801
because Jaz had had a few other kamikaze moves on the
band,

43:12.081 --> 43:14.241
Just when the band was going to fucking break Jaz would do
something

43:14.521 --> 43:16.681
to make sure it wouldn't happen.

43:16.961 --> 43:22.081
You know, one minute you're riding the crest of the wave and
the next minute, you know, your boat's sunk.

43:22.401 --> 43:24.801
Everything was open for them,

43:25.081 --> 43:26.561
when Jaz disappeared

43:26.841 --> 43:31.041
they have to cancel so many important events,

43:32.001 --> 43:34.321
the business never forgave that.

43:34.641 --> 43:37.161
TRUST KILLING JOKE TO MAKE AN IGNOBLE FUSS OVER LOST
PERSONNEL.

43:37.441 --> 43:41.761
Think they were under a lot of pressure from the record
company to start touring

43:42.041 --> 43:44.641
because the record had recently been out

43:44.921 --> 43:48.841
out and it was very important for them to start catching up.

43:49.121 --> 43:50.521
REVELATIONS? TOO TRUE! AND THAT'S JUST THE START.

43:50.801 --> 43:52.561
ARROGANCE AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE ANGER

43:52.841 --> 43:54.681
IT'S THE SOUND OF AN ANNIHILATING EFFICIENCY

43:54.961 --> 43:56.761
WITH A SHEEN OF GRATUITOUS NOISE MAKING.

43:57.041 --> 44:00.961
I got this phone call from a friend who was in contact with Jaz
and Geordie

44:01.241 --> 44:03.281
and asked me if I was willing to meet them, in a week

44:03.561 --> 44:06.161
I was in London.

44:06.441 --> 44:10.481
They lacked a drummer, they called Paul Ferguson and asked
him to come

44:10.761 --> 44:14.001
This must have been six months after they left or something

44:14.281 --> 44:17.601
in the meantime I'd lost... everything

44:17.881 --> 44:20.041
And trying to get this project, called Brilliant

44:20.321 --> 44:22.321
going with Youth,

44:22.601 --> 44:27.881
and I just got a telephone call saying “Would you consider,
you know, coming back.

44:29.841 --> 44:33.081
I went out there and felt...

44:33.361 --> 44:38.081
felt like, a bit of an outsider in a way,

44:38.361 --> 44:43.201
I felt that we hadn't really done what we'd set out to do.

44:43.481 --> 44:45.641
They told me that Paul was willing to join the band

44:45.921 --> 44:49.721
but he would decide which bass player he would play with.

44:50.001 --> 44:55.041
Told Youth,"I'm not doing this Brilliant thing with you
anymore, I'm going off to Wales"

44:55.321 --> 44:57.201
And it was Raven.

44:58.561 --> 45:03.081
I didn't speak to Youth again for quite a few years.

45:05.481 --> 45:08.401
BRILLIANT. THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR...

45:08.681 --> 45:11.361
I just took the flight back to Iceland.

45:15.681 --> 45:18.881
...people watching tonight may not have heard of, never
mind seen, the next band.

45:19.161 --> 45:22.161
That hasn't stopped them building up a fanatical following
and notching

45:22.441 --> 45:24.081
up four chart albums,

45:24.361 --> 45:26.681
here's a chance to find out what you've been missing, here
we have

45:26.961 --> 45:28.281
Killing Joke!

45:28.561 --> 45:30.521
This is called "Frenzy".

45:54.761 --> 45:58.321
When I met Raven was with a girl from my home town.

45:58.601 --> 46:01.721
He said, "This is Paul, wants to play in Killing Joke".

46:02.001 --> 46:04.961
I looked at him and thought, "Well, Youth has gone mad so,

46:05.241 --> 46:08.241
there might be a chance there!

46:09.681 --> 46:11.681
And this kid Raven showed up,

46:11.961 --> 46:14.721
I didn't know who he was, or where he came from,

46:15.001 --> 46:17.441
he was young, energetic, really

46:17.721 --> 46:21.921
really into doing it and, he had an attitude.

46:23.481 --> 46:25.481
Raven was party central,

46:25.761 --> 46:29.321
but he was also a very down to earth guy,

46:29.601 --> 46:31.601
he fitted in perfectly I think.

46:31.881 --> 46:34.721
Paul brought a different dynamic to the bass in the band...

46:35.001 --> 46:37.681
he defined himself outside of Youth.

46:49.601 --> 46:52.401
There was that point where he was doing all those curling
baselines and I think Paul

46:52.681 --> 46:57.081
gave him the space to do that because he always knew that
Paul would be rock solid behind him.

47:24.201 --> 47:26.601
After our trip to Iceland,

47:26.881 --> 47:29.721
where I began the process of individuation process

47:30.001 --> 47:33.521
I made contact with Hilmarsson.

47:33.801 --> 47:38.721
Hilmarsson gave me a strange object,

47:39.001 --> 47:41.401
that was carved out of ash.

47:41.681 --> 47:46.521
On one side it had a snowflake design,

47:46.801 --> 47:51.041
on the reverse side was my rune.

47:51.321 --> 47:56.721
I started having the habit of putting this object underneath
my pillow

47:57.001 --> 47:59.761
and I had three

48:00.041 --> 48:03.321
incredibly vivid dreams

48:03.601 --> 48:07.761
that would point me in the direction of a certain place at a
certain time

48:08.041 --> 48:14.041
The first of these, a voice was saying to me, “The Islands of the
North Atlantic";

48:14.321 --> 48:15.721
“Johan

48:16.001 --> 48:21.561
And so, in January of '82 I set off for Iona

48:21.841 --> 48:26.281
That's where the first transmission occurred.

48:36.801 --> 48:39.281
The pendulum gave me the indication

48:39.561 --> 48:42.561
that there was a mass of energy at this place called Duni,

48:42.841 --> 48:46.001
which is the highest point on Iona.

48:46.281 --> 48:51.961
I fasted for three days, I went up to the top of this mountain

48:52.241 --> 48:57.121
and then I got myself into my usual state of trance.

50:09.121 --> 50:11.521
I recited mantras and played the drum,

50:11.801 --> 50:15.081
until I heard a quiet voice that told me to stop

50:15.361 --> 50:19.001
it was at that point that the transmission began.

50:44.441 --> 50:47.081
The word “lcha”, and then it continued,

50:47.361 --> 50:50.801
“lchabod"; the veins are in the body of the gods.

50:51.081 --> 50:53.801
When I checked the Kabbalistic reference it gave

50:54.081 --> 50:57.161
“Eve”, or “to show forth",

50:57.441 --> 51:00.161
and Eve at the top of Duni means

51:00.441 --> 51:04.201
the point of fertilisation.

51:04.921 --> 51:08.481
I see the earth rising a second time,

51:09.361 --> 51:12.801
out of the foam, fair and green,

51:13.081 --> 51:16.961
down from the fells, fish to capture,

51:17.241 --> 51:19.561
wings to eagle... Good afternoon Prime Minister...

51:21.881 --> 51:27.001
Her Majesty The Queen has asked me to form a new
administration,

51:27.281 --> 51:28.921
and I have accepted.

51:29.201 --> 51:32.281
Where there is discord, may we bring harmony,

51:32.561 --> 51:35.761
where there is error, may we bring truth,

51:36.041 --> 51:40.001
where there is doubt, may we bring faith,

51:40.321 --> 51:44.401
where there is despair, may we bring hope."

51:55.161 --> 51:57.481
Eighties was kind of a groundbreaking track.

51:57.761 --> 52:02.441
It was a song about what was happening at that time in the
world.

52:04.521 --> 52:08.601
You never really heard it on the radio, Maggie Thatcher
wouldn't have it on,

52:08.881 --> 52:12.001
because he forecast the Falklands War before it actually
started!

52:12.281 --> 52:16.401
And she didn't like that.

52:21.401 --> 52:25.161
Geordie's guitar tuning on that track was unique

52:25.441 --> 52:29.641
Nirvana must have been huge fans because they played...

52:30.761 --> 52:34.041
What was that song. . .?

52:34.321 --> 52:37.601
Come As You Are. I mean that is Eighties.

52:39.801 --> 52:42.561
We've got a three million lawsuit against Nirvana

52:42.841 --> 52:45.361
for stealing Eighties off us which is Come As You Are,

52:45.641 --> 52:49.241
Kurt from Nirvana has already said “Yes we did it”!

52:49.521 --> 52:52.721
If it was resolved I don't, well I should have seen some money

52:53.001 --> 52:55.841
and I don't think anybody saw any money

52:58.401 --> 53:02.681
Oh well I didn't know who the fuck they were when I met
them, I didn't know anything about them

53:02.961 --> 53:07.081
but... I don't know why I got the call to work with them.

53:07.361 --> 53:11.161
I do know why; it was EG Records.

53:11.441 --> 53:15.601
They said “There's this very awkward band that we have on
the label

53:15.881 --> 53:18.361
that maybe you can help us with...

53:18.641 --> 53:20.881
Quite a few friends said ”What are you doing?"I said ”I'm
working

53:21.161 --> 53:23.561
with Killing Joke", they said, ”You're working with Killing Joke?

53:23.841 --> 53:29.121
Are you mad? They're crazy! They're devil worshippers!"

53:31.441 --> 53:34.081
In 1979 a British DJ felt that the name should be forbidden
and the band

53:34.361 --> 53:37.201
should be commandeered to rake leaves in Hyde Park, in
order to find inner peace.

53:37.481 --> 53:40.721
Killing Joke

53:46.641 --> 53:51.001
It was decided that we would go to Berlin to record the
album.

53:53.281 --> 53:56.841
Berlin <i>. .</i> .is the absolute insanity of humanity,

53:57.121 --> 53:59.681
absolute madness.

54:07.321 --> 54:12.241
Jaz favours countries that are in the midst of economic decay

54:12.521 --> 54:14.281
and collapse,

54:14.561 --> 54:17.641
he feels there's a power there, an electricity because there's a
certain

54:17.921 --> 54:20.521
thing going wrong

54:20.801 --> 54:25.041
We started recording and the band that I knew from London

54:25.321 --> 54:28.601
all of a sudden was a completely different beast

54:30.121 --> 54:32.761
QUITE SIMPLY THE BEST GUITAR RECORD THIS YEAR

54:34.681 --> 54:36.121
The Art of Evil

54:36.401 --> 54:38.881
KILLING JOKE, NIGHT TIME (EG). SUCCESS AT LAST FOR THE BAND
OF THE RISING APOCALYPSE OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEMSELVES

54:39.601 --> 54:43.641
Working with the band I suddenly began to realise how

54:43.921 --> 54:48.321
Geordie and Jaz worked off each other.

54:48.601 --> 54:50.321
Jaz is in awe of Geordie,

54:50.601 --> 54:54.441
because Geordie can interpret Jaz's chords in

54:54.721 --> 54:58.961
such a different way... I've never heard a guitar player like
Geordie,

54:59.241 --> 55:03.321
Geordie is <i>like...</i> His guitar is like playing... an orchestra.

55:13.281 --> 55:16.241
IT MAKES THE SMITHS LOOK AND SOUND LIKE SIMON AND
GARFUNKEL

55:23.001 --> 55:26.801
Love Like Blood was a deserved hit for all the right reasons.

55:27.081 --> 55:28.161
I don't think anyone

55:28.441 --> 55:30.321
could argue with them for that

55:30.601 --> 55:36.721
I think it kept the head bangers happy, kept the goth fans
happy, it was a little bit of genius songwriting.

55:50.681 --> 55:53.761
It was always great going to see them around that time on
tour,

55:54.041 --> 55:56.481
I remember seeing Jaz come down the stairs there

55:56.761 --> 55:59.201
and it literally was like seeing the return of Emperor Nero

55:59.481 --> 56:01.841
it was a fabulous feeling.

56:08.481 --> 56:13.721
It's one of the defining baselines of that era you know?

56:29.721 --> 56:34.081
It was not a conscious attempt at writing a commercial song
at all.

56:34.361 --> 56:38.001
We did start to tap into an emotional side

56:38.281 --> 56:40.841
that we hadn't explored before,

56:41.121 --> 56:42.921
I suppose it might have been partly

56:43.201 --> 56:45.841
Jaz's classical background.

56:46.121 --> 56:48.841
He just had an anthem, love like blood, love like blood,

56:49.121 --> 56:52.441
and that was all based around a book that Paul was reading.

56:53.121 --> 56:57.281
We did have a hit, wow, amazing.

57:01.121 --> 57:04.161
And it's the only time that we had any money,

57:04.441 --> 57:10.161
it wasn't very much but it was enough to go ”Oh, wow, this is
good?

57:11.961 --> 57:15.121
Yeah it was on every jukebox in every pub,

57:15.401 --> 57:18.961
and suddenly they were on the highest profile music show in
Britain at the time

57:19.241 --> 57:20.401
Raymond, of Killing Joke.

57:20.681 --> 57:21.801
Raven!

57:22.081 --> 57:24.321
You did it already! I knew I'd get something wrong!

57:24.601 --> 57:29.001
It was a very drunk Raven and Jaz were interviewed by Paula
Yates

57:29.281 --> 57:32.281
and Jaz going on about how like, you know, how solid they
were,

57:32.561 --> 57:36.361
one direction, big shiny boots, follow the drum, and they
came on and stormed it.

57:36.641 --> 57:40.681
Did you ever think that you would be suddenly so successful
after five albums?

57:40.961 --> 57:43.281
Why do you think it's happened like that, that suddenly
everyone's buying your records?

57:43.561 --> 57:44.361
Because...

57:44.681 --> 57:46.001
Shut up a minute...

57:46.281 --> 57:49.081
Because there's too many hairdressers around that's why

57:49.361 --> 57:51.601
and it's also because

57:51.881 --> 57:53.481
err

57:53.761 --> 57:56.041
we're just the most brilliant live band in the world.

57:56.321 --> 57:57.481
Get it?

57:57.761 --> 58:01.841
Do you think that saying things like that has made you a bit
unpopular in the past?

58:02.121 --> 58:05.921
Because you have had a terrible reputation for saying
outrageous things.

58:06.201 --> 58:09.001
What with journalists you mean? Yeah with journalists rather
than with...

58:09.281 --> 58:14.481
We've got, we've got a good relationship with the press
actually you know?

58:19.761 --> 58:23.481
They were hated <i>by...</i> the press.

58:23.761 --> 58:25.761
Music papers liked having Killing Joke because they knew...

58:26.041 --> 58:29.641
something was going to happen,

58:29.921 --> 58:32.481
they had a real love hate relationship with it.

58:32.761 --> 58:37.161
There was always this thing called the graveyard shift and it
always meant going to interview Killing Joke.

58:37.441 --> 58:39.801
Wasn't really so much a process of asking questions...

58:40.081 --> 58:44.161
One of them would say something... The other one would
criticize them for saying it...

58:44.441 --> 58:47.801
They would start arguing with each other...

58:48.081 --> 58:52.481
You just had to try and get in there and gradually make some
sense of it all.

58:53.841 --> 58:56.081
I don't think people really pay as much attention

58:56.361 --> 59:00.681
to music journalism as perhaps the media would like to think.

59:00.961 --> 59:02.761
"Jaz displays that Colgate ring of confidence"

59:03.041 --> 59:07.241
Like all the people at the NME, these people think they're
<i>like...</i> gods or something.

59:08.361 --> 59:11.241
It was a good game for some years and they played it well,

59:11.521 --> 59:15.001
the band, for quite a while.

59:15.281 --> 59:18.121
Some people, who didn't really realise what you're talking
about

59:18.401 --> 59:20.561
would probably construe that as negativism.

59:20.841 --> 59:24.921
I cannot see how we can be portrayed as negative.

59:25.201 --> 59:28.321
The only true optimism comes from realism.

59:28.601 --> 59:32.161
Jaz, a hundred quotes a minute worth blowing up in big type.

59:32.441 --> 59:35.721
I WILL DEFINE THE ATOMIC SOUND BEFORE I'M DEAD

59:36.001 --> 59:38.001
JAZ COLEMAN "I AM NOT A NUTCASE!"CLAIM

59:38.281 --> 59:40.761
Newspapers never lie!

59:41.041 --> 59:43.601
I'm pleased I wasn't handling their publicity!

59:43.881 --> 59:45.521
Geordie I was reading the biog

59:45.801 --> 59:48.721
and it said something about the Gematria system that you'd
been getting into

59:49.001 --> 59:51.761
Gematria system, Gematria system? What's that about?

59:52.041 --> 59:53.001
Well...Go for it.

59:53.281 --> 59:54.241
Back to Jaz!

59:54.521 --> 59:58.401
They generally didn't really care about being in the press, but
at the same time Jaz loves to have an audience.

59:58.681 --> 01:00:03.241
That is using the beats per minute and relating that to
numerology,

01:00:03.521 --> 01:00:06.081
which is obviously an ascetic pursuit of arts.

01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:08.481
Most people didn't really know what Jaz was talking about...

01:00:08.761 --> 01:00:10.841
Good lord, it sounds like, quite heady that

01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:13.961
but, so, let's pick up the conversation again in a minute...

01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:17.201
Because Jaz often wouldn't talk about it, I mean Jaz would
mention it

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:20.561
and then as soon as the journalist would go "So would you
like to clarify?"

01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:22.441
”No, fuck off!"

01:00:22.721 --> 01:00:26.641
“Well why did you mention it?"

01:00:26.921 --> 01:00:31.961
It became, obviously, a talking point with the press because it
was a bit, you know, woooh.

01:00:34.521 --> 01:00:39.681
I always felt that Jaz was the active part and Geordie was
perhaps more in-sinuous obviously,

01:00:39.961 --> 01:00:43.041
because they share the same beliefs and everything.

01:00:48.641 --> 01:00:51.081
The sound that comes out of this man Geordie,

01:00:51.361 --> 01:00:54.761
it strikes terror into every guitarist on the planet;

01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:58.721
you know it's Geordie, you know it cannot be any other
guitarist.

01:01:04.441 --> 01:01:08.201
Geordie is just a phenomenally innovative musician.

01:01:08.481 --> 01:01:10.721
Got a unique, vicious,

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.561
bitter, biting, twang to his guitar.

01:01:13.841 --> 01:01:15.641
Yeah he's got an amazing sound;

01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:19.041
the intensity of that is the subtlety of less is more, you know
you can overplay

01:01:19.321 --> 01:01:22.561
and bugger it all up, you know?

01:01:28.681 --> 01:01:32.721
You're in the band with him, I'm watching Geordie for every
cue.

01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:38.241
Which is interesting, because you usually follow the singer,
and that's the key; you watch Geordie.

01:01:50.401 --> 01:01:54.881
With Geordie, he could have gone out there and become part
of a lot of other bands,

01:01:55.161 --> 01:01:58.521
and I'm talking big bands, you know bands like Metallica or
something like that,

01:01:58.801 --> 01:02:01.681
but he's stuck with Killing Joke all the way through.

01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:04.361
He's never really got a lot of money out of Killing Joke,

01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:08.601
but he's, you know, got that strong allegiance to being in
Killing Joke

01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:10.801
Jah Wobble said,

01:02:11.081 --> 01:02:14.561
“imagine an Avro Lancaster, 1942 bomber.

01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:18.561
A guy in the leather hat and a cigarette holder and cigarette,

01:02:18.841 --> 01:02:21.361
and a gin and tonic in the other hand,

01:02:21.641 --> 01:02:24.201
'Right we're over the target!'

01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:26.641
that's how I'd describe Geordie Walker to you."

01:02:26.921 --> 01:02:30.841
He's so English, he can't live in England anymore; he lives in
Prague

01:02:31.121 --> 01:02:35.561
in a weird sort of way the Dickensian blackened streets of
Prague

01:02:35.841 --> 01:02:38.201
owe more to his sense of Englishness

01:02:38.481 --> 01:02:42.441
than anything England could offer anymore.

01:02:52.641 --> 01:02:55.441
For someone who's had such a big impact, Geordie's a very
quiet

01:02:55.721 --> 01:02:58.281
guy in the public face I think.

01:02:58.561 --> 01:03:02.521
You'll find that my partner Geordie

01:03:02.801 --> 01:03:06.561
doesn't do interviews, unlike me

01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:09.561
and his reason for this is that

01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:14.681
he cannot see the point in talking about music,

01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:16.841
when it should be listened to.

01:03:17.121 --> 01:03:23.201
Now I can really understand that although...

01:03:29.481 --> 01:03:31.401
When Geordie came to Iceland

01:03:31.681 --> 01:03:34.681
with his full bodied jazz guitar,

01:03:34.961 --> 01:03:38.961
we couldn't understand what he was doing with this
instrument...

01:03:41.961 --> 01:03:44.921
But he played it like a motherfucker!

01:03:46.881 --> 01:03:49.921
Which is the shit that's got the goo!

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.401
You know you just know when it has...

01:03:52.681 --> 01:03:54.521
"Give us the goo!"

01:03:54.801 --> 01:03:56.561
It's suspensions as well, there's always

01:03:56.841 --> 01:03:58.921
the odd ringing note

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:01.881
and you move chords and that's still ringing

01:04:02.161 --> 01:04:06.121
a suspensions... it's what you get with the echo too,

01:04:06.401 --> 01:04:08.761
because there's previous notes from previous stuff still
decaying

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:11.601
under it

01:04:22.961 --> 01:04:26.401
He always plays the same guitar, because it's semi-acoustic

01:04:26.681 --> 01:04:29.721
it enlarges the sound, it rings more.

01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:34.681
And he would play through two Burman amplifiers

01:04:34.961 --> 01:04:37.281
with a little chorus on them.

01:04:37.561 --> 01:04:40.081
And he's playing these weird shapes and inversions,

01:04:40.361 --> 01:04:42.321
he's got all these harmonic overtones

01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:46.041
because it's a semi-acoustic guitar...

01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:52.601
It's fucking resonances and beats, it's fucking microscopic
you know?

01:04:52.881 --> 01:04:53.881
It's like, you can hear it,

01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:57.961
you just heard it, when you tune it up and you get that beat,

01:04:58.241 --> 01:05:01.041
it's getting that at the right sort of resonance,

01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:03.681
as a low fucking frequency thing going on too

01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:06.601
Its not fucking unlike cooking.

01:05:06.881 --> 01:05:11.281
Getting all the fucking flavours sort <i>of...</i>

01:05:12.081 --> 01:05:14.041
resonated.

01:05:15.721 --> 01:05:17.881
Geordie is the most honest man you'll meet.

01:05:18.161 --> 01:05:22.281
He'll tell you, whether you want to hear it or not, there's no
doubt about that.

01:05:22.561 --> 01:05:24.001
He's got a pretty short fuse,

01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:27.761
he's a perfect foil to Jaz, you know, that's why it worked.

01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:40.921
Geordie and Jaz are the alchemical marriage.

01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:43.641
Elementally they're really well balanced,

01:05:43.921 --> 01:05:48.041
Geordie is earthy and fire-y and Jaz is air-y and watery

01:05:48.321 --> 01:05:51.521
so they have the perfect alchemical material.

01:06:02.881 --> 01:06:07.361
You get the theatrical Jaz you know with all his stance and all
that.

01:06:07.641 --> 01:06:10.561
And you get Geordie, it's like he's playing a ballad on the side
of stage.

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:13.481
Their charts are really well linked.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.521
Jaz has Jupiter in Sagittarius sits right

01:06:15.801 --> 01:06:19.001
on all Geordie's planets in Sagittarius

01:06:19.281 --> 01:06:20.721
and it's ascendant in Capricorn

01:06:21.001 --> 01:06:24.121
so it's a hugely abundant creative relationship.

01:06:36.321 --> 01:06:39.881
You have the feeling that nothing can touch Geordie.

01:06:54.201 --> 01:06:55.481
Bless us,

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:59.761
and all who come on pilgrimage to Glastonbury

01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:02.921
Guide our feet on the path of righteousness,

01:07:03.201 --> 01:07:05.281
inspire us by your spirit...

01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:09.881
I went to Glastonbury on February the 2nd 1982,

01:07:10.161 --> 01:07:13.441
and I got the second transmission.

01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:22.721
This transmission began with “Hraachmaa”,

01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:28.401
this word which was 256, the number of the spider,

01:07:28.681 --> 01:07:33.001
which has 256 kalas in the voodoo cult.

01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:38.841
And actually, when I studied it more,

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.241
256 is the

01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:44.521
'Spirit of the Mother'.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:52.281
Within days of going to Glastonbury

01:07:53.241 --> 01:07:58.801
I opened Tony Morrison's book Pathways of the Gods,

01:07:59.081 --> 01:08:05.241
and there in front of me was the Spider at the Pampas de San
Jose,

01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:09.881
with its abdomen intersected by a line

01:08:10.161 --> 01:08:15.601
that was aligned to the constellation of Orion.

01:08:15.881 --> 01:08:19.761
I worked out when, approximately,

01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:25.121
the constellation of Orion would be coming over the horizon,

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.241
and went straight to the Pampas.

01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:50.201
I arrived there two weeks before

01:08:50.481 --> 01:08:54.401
the proposed time of ritual,

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.481
I pitched my tent behind a small hillock

01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:03.761
and lived in a semi-primitive state.

01:09:05.081 --> 01:09:09.481
Three days before the ritual I began my fast,

01:09:09.761 --> 01:09:13.600
and then on the third day, after nightfall,

01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:20.841
I made my way up one of the pathways I knew would
intersect with the Spider's abdomen.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.961
When I arrived in the correct place, I began to play the drums

01:09:34.241 --> 01:09:37.560
and immersed myself in mantra,

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.281
so I could get to the past and future place

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.921
of Universe B.

01:09:54.001 --> 01:09:59.001
And again, a voice told me to start writing,

01:10:01.081 --> 01:10:04.641
and the first word of the writing was “Tomenga”.

01:10:06.961 --> 01:10:12.681
The quicksilver methodology of communication;

01:10:12.961 --> 01:10:16.201
this is the third degree.

01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:24.441
...out of the foam, fair and green...

01:10:25.441 --> 01:10:29.921
I discovered that ordinary men and women

01:10:31.601 --> 01:10:34.281
guard these vector points

01:10:34.561 --> 01:10:38.121
where UFOs and UAVs

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:42.521
and hyper-dimensional entities manifest.

01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:12.601
Right, that's where it was, right?

01:11:12.881 --> 01:11:18.401
And when you come here, right watch this, this whole area
was static right?

01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:22.161
There were at least nine or ten...

01:11:22.881 --> 01:11:24.321
balls, glowing balls.

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:27.161
And then it starts flashing this image to us,

01:11:27.441 --> 01:11:31.241
like pulsating but strobing like..."

01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:35.841
It stayed in the air for ages didn't it? It didn't move away for a
while.

01:11:36.121 --> 01:11:38.641
Do you understand where I'm coming from? I'm a military
man, I know this shit.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:42.161
And one of them shot towards <i>us...</i>

01:11:45.521 --> 01:11:52.841
This is after we've already, fucking, you know, like literally just
been like absorbed by this energy.

01:11:53.161 --> 01:11:58.241
I found it quite bizarre how this first confrontation I had,

01:11:58.521 --> 01:12:00.961
with something I believed deep down inside happened

01:12:01.241 --> 01:12:03.041
in the presence ofJaz.

01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:05.561
They flashed a symbol at us,

01:12:05.841 --> 01:12:08.601
it's kind of weird, because I recognised the symbol,

01:12:08.881 --> 01:12:12.401
it was like a matchstick man

01:12:12.681 --> 01:12:15.121
with a line through his head.

01:12:15.401 --> 01:12:20.121
That, experiencing in there, I think they knew me, Yeah, I felt
like I'd been looked at.

01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:25.401
To Jaz it was something else.

01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:52.761
Brighter than a Thousand Suns, that's when he was...

01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:56.601
...trying to sing properly! Stop it.

01:12:58.761 --> 01:13:05.161
It was a bit of a labour of love because I didn't choose to go
to Amsterdam to record the album,

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:09.761
it's the last place where I would have taken Killing Joke, Berlin
was dangerous enough.

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.281
LACK OF PRUNING RITUALS

01:13:12.561 --> 01:13:14.841
ENSURING NO HIT SINGLES FLY HERE

01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:17.841
Melody Maker, in its gossip column, printed this photograph
ofJaz

01:13:18.121 --> 01:13:21.561
getting out of a swimming pool with all his hair sort of
squashed down

01:13:21.841 --> 01:13:23.201
and was basically taking the piss out of him

01:13:23.481 --> 01:13:27.001
because the single hadn't been the number one that
everyone had expected.

01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:30.481
The Phone started ringing, it's Jaz at a hundred miles an hour
in my ear,

01:13:30.761 --> 01:13:34.241
“Who's the person that wrote it? Who's the person that wrote
it? I'm going to get my pendulum and come up there,

01:13:34.521 --> 01:13:36.921
I'm going to point it at everyone and find out who wrote
that."

01:13:37.201 --> 01:13:40.161
I had been interviewing the band, and after Jaz said,

01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:43.081
“Come with me I'm going to give you a good story...

01:13:43.361 --> 01:13:46.201
So we jumped in a car, he tells the driver to stop

01:13:46.481 --> 01:13:49.481
at a fishing tackle shop. He comes outwith a package,

01:13:49.761 --> 01:13:53.281
we go on a bit further, and he stops at a butcher's shop,
comes outwith a package.

01:13:53.561 --> 01:13:54.881
Phone call from reception,

01:13:55.161 --> 01:13:57.321
"Oh Mat, I've got Jaz Coleman in reception for you shall I let
him in?"

01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:58.721
”No, no, don't let him in!"

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:03.361
There was a security door where all the journalists from
Melody Maker were pressed up against the glass,

01:14:03.641 --> 01:14:07.361
all staring, wide eyed, and none of them would dare come
out.

01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:11.521
So I went out to the reception and Jaz was there, and was all
lovely Jaz you know,

01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:15.161
he sort of put my arm round him and goes, “Ah Mat, pleased
to see you,

01:14:15.441 --> 01:14:16.641
shall we go in?”and I said,

01:14:16.921 --> 01:14:19.281
“You know I can't let you in there Jaz, because I know what's
going

01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:23.921
to happen if I let you in there it's going to be chaos."And at
that point he just went crazy

01:14:24.201 --> 01:14:27.161
He takes out this piece of liver from his jacket

01:14:27.441 --> 01:14:29.841
and slaps this liver on the table,

01:14:30.121 --> 01:14:34.801
then he takes out a tub of maggots and he dumps the
maggots over the liver...

01:14:35.081 --> 01:14:37.081
and started throwing it all over the reception

01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:39.321
these maggots just go crawling across this desk

01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:43.361
the poor receptionist is screaming her head off.

01:14:43.641 --> 01:14:47.361
DELIVER US FROM EVIL

01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:52.081
And he had these scissors which he dug into the table

01:14:56.641 --> 01:14:58.801
and recited some Latin and said

01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:02.721
"I want this journalist to call and apologise for what he's
written about me."

01:15:03.001 --> 01:15:05.241
Part of it was brilliant, part of it was frightening,

01:15:05.521 --> 01:15:08.321
part of it was like, where the fuck is this going to end?

01:15:08.601 --> 01:15:10.761
It was welcome to Jaz world, for everyone

01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:13.321
in that reception that day.

01:15:26.201 --> 01:15:29.841
Suddenly we're on all these pop shows around Europe

01:15:30.121 --> 01:15:33.641
and the sort of, the other side of the coin.

01:15:33.921 --> 01:15:37.041
Oh, this is a commercial band now.

01:15:37.321 --> 01:15:38.441
It was nice you know,

01:15:38.721 --> 01:15:41.361
it was like a little glittery thing

01:15:41.641 --> 01:15:43.761
dancing in front of your eyes

01:15:44.041 --> 01:15:46.681
but it didn't bring us any closer together,

01:15:46.961 --> 01:15:50.001
if anything we got further apart from each other.

01:16:05.801 --> 01:16:09.841
The Joke kind of lost control of their empire themselves,

01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:12.681
it got very dissipated

01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:16.681
and the reason I think it got dissipated was because

01:16:17.561 --> 01:16:19.801
they didn't have any money, they were broke.

01:16:20.081 --> 01:16:22.721
Night Time album was very successful

01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:27.441
Brighter was, you know, relatively successful

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:32.521
the deal that they were sucked into, they were never going to
make any money.

01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:35.201
They were just losing all the time.

01:16:35.481 --> 01:16:40.241
They weren't going to be Top 10 every record,

01:16:40.521 --> 01:16:43.921
you sign to a big label what do they want?

01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:48.001
Why are they bothering to put money into you if you're not
going to pay them back with hits?

01:16:48.281 --> 01:16:49.961
Yes we were under pressure,

01:16:50.241 --> 01:16:52.721
Yes the record should be better than the last one,

01:16:53.001 --> 01:16:58.481
Yes you should, you know, try and follow in the vein of Love
Like Blood or whatever,

01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:00.481
but we'd just discovered an emotional

01:17:00.761 --> 01:17:03.881
side that we wanted to pursue.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:06.481
Killing Joke were stuck between...

01:17:06.761 --> 01:17:09.721
at that point they were trying to be as independent

01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:11.641
and as bloody minded as ever

01:17:11.921 --> 01:17:15.441
but they also wouldn't have minded having number one hits,

01:17:15.721 --> 01:17:18.081
I don't think you can have both.

01:17:18.361 --> 01:17:22.881
For a label I think, they would have been one almighty
headache,

01:17:23.161 --> 01:17:24.801
I'm sure.

01:17:56.841 --> 01:18:03.761
I really liked the idea that we'd have this incredibly powerful
musical thing

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:07.321
and nobody would know ever who did it;

01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:11.001
I thought it was a lovely idea,

01:18:11.281 --> 01:18:14.721
but of course, you get on stage and you're all there what are
you going to do?

01:18:15.001 --> 01:18:17.001
Play behind a screen?

01:18:26.481 --> 01:18:28.761
Once people are interested in hearing

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:31.401
what the singer has to say, suddenly

01:18:31.681 --> 01:18:34.361
you've got a cult of personality

01:18:34.641 --> 01:18:39.281
and to a large extent I think that's why we eventually fell out.

01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:43.601
It talks about an incandescent column of smoke and flame

01:18:43.881 --> 01:18:45.521
brighter than a thousand suns...

01:18:45.801 --> 01:18:49.401
I'm not saying anybody's right or wrong here

01:18:50.281 --> 01:18:53.681
it was becoming more and more about ego,

01:18:53.961 --> 01:18:56.201
and my ego was getting hurt.

01:19:38.281 --> 01:19:41.881
IT'S NO JOKE

01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:49.561
RAVEN AND FERGUSON QUIT KILLING JOKE

01:19:50.321 --> 01:19:53.441
JAZ BUTCHERED

01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:56.361
...the original line up, only you two I think?

01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:58.561
There have been changes, there had to be changes,

01:19:58.841 --> 01:20:02.281
The fact is we don't really want a sort of punk rhythm section

01:20:02.561 --> 01:20:04.041
for the next eight years you know?

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:08.921
Some of his behaviour was an affront to me,

01:20:09.201 --> 01:20:11.201
an affront to the band;

01:20:11.481 --> 01:20:13.481
we couldn't be in the same room together.

01:20:13.761 --> 01:20:17.961
We wanted a more articulate, funky, powerful rhythm section.

01:20:18.241 --> 01:20:21.801
Did the other guys feel bad about it? Not at all we paid them
off... ha ha ha

01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:26.241
And then of course, he started doing his solo material

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:30.881
which started costing an awful lot of money and the record
company said,

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:34.081
“Well no, this has to be a band project."

01:20:34.361 --> 01:20:39.121
So I recorded drums with him not being there

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:42.721
and I refused to listen to any of the keyboards on the record
while I was doing it

01:20:43.001 --> 01:20:46.561
which is just insane, I was playing completely out of time.

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:49.921
I got the message that the drum tracks were no good,

01:20:50.201 --> 01:20:54.081
you'll have to pay for them and do them again,

01:20:54.361 --> 01:20:59.401
and I just said, “Fuck it, I'm not going to." I just left the country.

01:21:02.321 --> 01:21:04.361
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED THAT JAZ HAS HIS HEAD SO FAR UP
HIS ARSE NOW.

01:21:04.641 --> 01:21:06.241
THERE'S TOO MUCH EGO STROKING GOING ON

01:21:08.121 --> 01:21:09.841
JAZ STOPPED WRITING LYRICS WITH PAUL

01:21:10.121 --> 01:21:11.801
THE WORDS BECAME A SERIES OF DEMENTED RANTINGS

01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:14.281
I'M BONKERS!

01:21:14.561 --> 01:21:17.281
As long as I'm alive, as long as Geordie's alive, Killing Joke is
alive,

01:21:17.561 --> 01:21:19.561
right?

01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:26.921
And it got to a stage with Jaz where he went into deep
depression,

01:21:27.201 --> 01:21:29.841
he was being sued by the record company

01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:34.001
if he ever walked out of his front door there'd be a person
with a writ there,

01:21:34.281 --> 01:21:38.001
so he could never work again unless he started paying the bill
off.

01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:42.721
He was terrified, he was in the middle of a nervous
breakdown

01:21:43.001 --> 01:21:48.041
His passion and intensity is good, but invariably, you know,
you mix passion and intensity

01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:51.361
with a big bag of drugs and a load of booze

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:54.681
and you're going to get someone going off the handle aren't
you really?

01:21:54.961 --> 01:22:00.321
You have written, they're lying here on the floor, a symphony
and a book, you are quite a busy person.

01:22:00.601 --> 01:22:04.841
That's right, my symphony I hope to have performed this
year,

01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:07.321
in England I hope and the other side of the world... Can I
show it?

01:22:07.601 --> 01:22:08.521
Sure. Is it really a symphony?

01:22:08.801 --> 01:22:09.761
That's right... And then

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:16.161
then it was the beginning of his classical career.

01:22:29.241 --> 01:22:31.441
Art of Noise supremo Anne Dudley

01:22:31.721 --> 01:22:34.001
and Jaz Coleman, Killing Joke's founder member,

01:22:34.281 --> 01:22:37.401
are an unlikely couple to see on the streets of Cairo.

01:22:37.681 --> 01:22:40.921
They came here to record an album called Songs from the
Victorious City,

01:22:41.201 --> 01:22:44.441
“Victorious City"being the literal translation of Cairo.

01:22:44.721 --> 01:22:46.681
A mutual love of classical music

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.841
drew Dudley and Coleman together on this project;

01:22:49.121 --> 01:22:51.441
he's a classically trained violinist

01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:55.041
and she spent three years studying at the Royal College of
Music

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:17.401
When at first I met him he was very crazy.

01:23:17.681 --> 01:23:22.041
Because he told me, “I want to learn about the Arabic music."

01:23:23.801 --> 01:23:27.441
He wanted to know everything, you can see it in his eyes.

01:23:27.721 --> 01:23:30.681
So I keep learning him for about ten days

01:23:30.961 --> 01:23:34.361
after that, I was surprised he could write our Arabic

01:23:34.641 --> 01:23:37.041
music, as one of us.

01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:45.761
I didn't believe that he can make good harmony

01:23:46.041 --> 01:23:50.881
between the Western and the Oriental music, but he has
done it.

01:23:52.401 --> 01:23:55.761
He'd been playing me bits and pieces of symphonies that
he'd been writing

01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:57.801
through the Joke sessions, but

01:23:58.081 --> 01:24:01.921
this was the first time that it was a collaboration and
someone released it.

01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:04.241
The biggest pop star in Egypt!

01:24:04.521 --> 01:24:07.761
And then, of course, the depression disappeared

01:24:08.041 --> 01:24:10.481
and Jaz's classical career was

01:24:10.761 --> 01:24:13.361
just taking off right, left and centre.

01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:17.361
This is called the Zep Symphony. Symphony; it's a symphony,

01:24:17.641 --> 01:24:22.321
I tell you... <i>...the</i> machinery is in place,

01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:25.601
big record, London Philharmonic Orchestra,

01:24:25.881 --> 01:24:30.001
and I'll take you, to the West, one go, tonight.

01:24:30.281 --> 01:24:32.481
It was a surprise for me,

01:24:32.761 --> 01:24:38.081
to find English people interested in our music...

01:24:38.361 --> 01:24:43.801
He sat at the piano and I sat at the kanun and we tried to
make a relation.

01:24:44.081 --> 01:24:47.881
Since this time I found he knows what he wants.

01:24:52.281 --> 01:24:54.041
Good.

01:24:58.361 --> 01:25:02.561
I heard that he was doing it, but I didn't get to hear it until the
end

01:25:02.841 --> 01:25:04.961
and I thought he'd done a magnificent job

01:25:05.241 --> 01:25:08.201
OK it was Led Zeppelin, but he'd brought Jaz Coleman to the
party;

01:25:08.481 --> 01:25:11.441
Jaz is in there, alive and well.

01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:21.521
Jaz, being classically trained, fantastic musician,

01:25:21.801 --> 01:25:23.801
in the pages of the music press they didn't really deal with
that

01:25:24.081 --> 01:25:26.801
I think a lot of the antagonism in the early days

01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:29.041
was just journalists not understanding it.

01:25:29.321 --> 01:25:31.961
He won the St Nicolas Award at the age of four

01:25:32.241 --> 01:25:35.081
in the pop landscape of the time that meant for nothing
really.

01:25:35.361 --> 01:25:40.561
It was just very easy for them to say, “Oh, well, he's mad isn't
he."And then sort of like, take the piss out of him,

01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:43.681
but he wasn't mad, he was passionate.

01:25:56.481 --> 01:25:59.881
You don't have to be Egyptian to enjoy Egyptian music, you
don't have to be

01:26:00.161 --> 01:26:03.241
West Indian to enjoy Caribbean music;

01:26:03.521 --> 01:26:08.441
it's whatever you identify with, spiritually.

01:26:08.721 --> 01:26:10.761
Is Jaz religious?

01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:17.601
Is he a Muslim? <i>...He</i> must.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.321
2000, JAZ COLEMAN WEDDING, MOROCCO

01:26:20.601 --> 01:26:24.961
Everyone is Muslim.

01:26:25.241 --> 01:26:27.481
They make themselves Christian or Jewish <i>or...</i>

01:26:27.761 --> 01:26:32.161
but the religion it's one, it's one god, you believe or you don't
believe.

01:26:36.961 --> 01:26:39.481
What do you think will happen to mankind?

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:42.201
It's finished, it must finish.

01:26:45.641 --> 01:26:50.161
Everything has a start and have an end.

01:26:50.441 --> 01:26:52.201
Our Prophet,

01:26:52.481 --> 01:26:54.201
he's the last prophet.

01:26:54.481 --> 01:26:57.481
Someone asked him about the day of the end,

01:26:57.761 --> 01:27:01.321
“Between me and the end,

01:27:01.601 --> 01:27:04.921
lies from this finger to the other one."

01:27:08.961 --> 01:27:12.401
I don't know how much time from hereto here;

01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:16.241
it doesn't make a difference for me, it's going to the end.

01:27:21.881 --> 01:27:24.041
Did you prepare yourself for the end?

01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:27.241
This is, this is the question.

01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:33.321
When Egypt goes,

01:27:33.601 --> 01:27:38.121
which it will do because of the decreasing geomagnetic field,

01:27:38.401 --> 01:27:41.081
it's a kind of signal. And this was written

01:27:41.361 --> 01:27:47.521
into the holiest books of the occult in modern times.

01:27:47.801 --> 01:27:51.201
There's going to be a huge upheaval coming.

01:27:56.921 --> 01:28:01.361
There will be fire and blood, in the Victorious City

01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:05.121
Al Qahirah is the Victorious City.

01:28:07.761 --> 01:28:13.521
We're at 0.05 gauss at the moment, and we're decreasing to 0
gauss,

01:28:13.801 --> 01:28:16.521
as soon as we get close to 0 gauss,

01:28:16.801 --> 01:28:19.001
they've done the tests on the astronauts,

01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:25.161
this manifests in terms of random aggression and madness,
basically.

01:28:30.921 --> 01:28:33.041
When Cairo

01:28:33.321 --> 01:28:34.721
<i>...falls,</i>

01:28:35.001 --> 01:28:40.001
we are a matter of, maybe a year at maximum, away from

01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:42.521
...singularity.

01:28:53.601 --> 01:28:55.041
Killing Joke is back...

01:28:55.321 --> 01:28:58.881
The band that ties spirituality with primal violence has
reformed,

01:28:59.161 --> 01:29:02.721
re-uniting with bassist Raven and joined by drummer Martin
Atkins,

01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:05.481
who previously played with Public Image Limited.

01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:08.481
They have major new music and major new ideas,

01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:12.241
and they're getting no support from major record companies.

01:29:22.961 --> 01:29:27.881
Well when they came back together, the band took complete
creative control,

01:29:28.161 --> 01:29:30.561
they didn't listen to any outside pressure

01:29:30.841 --> 01:29:35.161
We will make the record, then nobody will say anything to us.

01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:45.281
It was good to see them angry again, it was less poetry,
more... more hate.

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.721
When Big Paul left Raven said,

01:29:49.001 --> 01:29:53.601
“He made my job as easy as anything, all I had to do was turn
up when Big Paul was playing drums,

01:29:53.881 --> 01:29:57.081
Martin was even more aggressive and intricate I would say.

01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:01.801
There was a jazz element to Martin that really propelled the
band in a different direction.

01:30:03.561 --> 01:30:08.161
Would you like to tell us what you've been doing in the sort of,
last few years when we haven't heard anything from Killing Joke?

01:30:08.441 --> 01:30:11.441
It's probably been the worst two years of my life,

01:30:11.721 --> 01:30:13.721
everybody in the band went through absolute hell,

01:30:14.001 --> 01:30:17.561
we all got to the point where there was absolutely... we were
100% skint,

01:30:17.841 --> 01:30:20.721
and I ended up in a psychiatric ward actually.

01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:24.481
The BEAST IS BACK!

01:30:25.321 --> 01:30:28.641
...any other handy missiles at the police and colliery
buildings,

01:30:28.921 --> 01:30:30.841
the police responded by sending in a snatch squad.

01:30:31.121 --> 01:30:33.361
The miners resisted and the police...

01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:42.681
EXTREMITIES IS THE MORE INTENSE WORK TO DATE

01:30:45.561 --> 01:30:48.161
IF THEY EVER TOP THIS

01:30:48.441 --> 01:30:51.041
THEY ARE NOT GENIUSES, THEY ARE DEITIES

01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:53.601
Jaz had been having a terrible time in the lead up to that
album,

01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:57.161
he told me once that, he felt as if he'd been made of glass,

01:30:57.441 --> 01:31:01.201
that he was actually possessed. And I think a lot of that fed
into that album

01:31:01.481 --> 01:31:05.841
I think it's one of those great things that Killing Joke do, when
they're at the top of their game, is

01:31:06.121 --> 01:31:09.441
mix what's going on, the turmoil inside the band,

01:31:09.721 --> 01:31:11.881
with the turmoil that's going on in the political world,

01:31:12.161 --> 01:31:14.241
they've done it a lot of times. <i>..</i>

01:31:17.921 --> 01:31:21.361
And it was the age of greed, it was the age of Thatcher
privatising everything;

01:31:21.641 --> 01:31:25.921
gas, electricity, water, everything was being taken out of the
hands of the people.

01:31:26.201 --> 01:31:30.401
Jaz being this fantastic romanticist European hated that,

01:31:30.681 --> 01:31:34.241
on that album he rebelled against it brilliantly.

01:31:38.321 --> 01:31:41.841
People need something to resemble the struggle they have
in

01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:44.161
in trying to make a living today,

01:31:44.441 --> 01:31:48.441
they need this level of intensity in the music and we provide
that.

01:31:48.721 --> 01:31:51.481
It's strange that you really like the live work with Killing Joke
and yet with your

01:31:51.761 --> 01:31:54.681
orchestral arrangements you've got to be right behind...

01:31:54.961 --> 01:31:57.561
Oh he's a different person, completely different person,

01:31:57.841 --> 01:32:01.401
he's got another name, I mean I call him Jaz but he's the other
Jaz,

01:32:01.681 --> 01:32:04.481
he wears different clothes, that's another lifetime.

01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:16.561
Whoever invented the jester persona for Jaz was

01:32:16.841 --> 01:32:19.761
incredibly prophetic.

01:32:20.041 --> 01:32:23.721
That stick where you turn, and one side's miserable and black

01:32:24.001 --> 01:32:28.001
and the other sides a harlequin and all the rest of it; that's him

01:32:30.721 --> 01:32:33.481
Jaz can be very calm and very collected...

01:32:33.761 --> 01:32:36.121
"Don't fucking run away from me..."

01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:37.721
Say it again... Say it again.

01:32:38.001 --> 01:32:40.681
Is there another side to Jaz, can he freak out?

01:32:40.961 --> 01:32:42.561
Yeah of course he can.

01:32:54.521 --> 01:32:57.961
I'm the chosen boy, and you better fucking believe it you
fucker.

01:32:58.241 --> 01:33:01.201
He's a very gentle reflective person inside,

01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:04.281
I mean you wouldn't think that looking at Killing Joke

01:33:04.561 --> 01:33:07.281
but inside, as you know...

01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:15.801
He's quite introvert, and he worries, he worries a lot.

01:33:16.081 --> 01:33:19.721
His mind is, you know, it's more dangerous than a computer
his mind

01:33:20.001 --> 01:33:22.561
it's <i>like...</i> he never stops thinking.

01:33:22.921 --> 01:33:25.561
...man is an aggressive, predatory beast...

01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:29.081
Wall Street crash that happened six, six months ago

01:33:29.361 --> 01:33:30.801
is going to reoccur again...

01:33:31.081 --> 01:33:35.321
why do we focus our lives exclusively to the acquisition of
material possessions

01:33:35.601 --> 01:33:39.361
when we won't be taking anything with us when we go?

01:33:41.041 --> 01:33:46.801
He'll always hook onto something because it's almost verging
on paranoia in some ways,

01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:49.881
he has a deep fear of something,

01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:53.521
and he manifests it in different ways.

01:33:57.641 --> 01:34:00.321
Right from the start he had this problem,

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:03.241
he would be listening to things

01:34:03.521 --> 01:34:05.721
he'd be scared outside that

01:34:06.001 --> 01:34:10.881
he had fears, and I wasn't sure why.

01:34:17.201 --> 01:34:20.961
He was a chorister in a church choir,

01:34:21.241 --> 01:34:24.841
he was so committed, they said he was quite spiritual.

01:34:25.601 --> 01:34:29.401
He would get amazing reports from the Royal College of
Church Music

01:34:29.681 --> 01:34:34.521
about this exceptional boy who could sing like a dream and
play like a dream.

01:34:34.801 --> 01:34:40.681
He wasn't doing very well at school, but we knew that he had
talents.

01:34:49.281 --> 01:34:53.721
I don't know whether I believe in lineage or inheritance or
caste,

01:34:54.001 --> 01:34:58.921
but I do have Persian as well as Hindu in me; I'm a half-caste.

01:34:59.201 --> 01:35:02.921
I was brought up in a very white, middle class town called
Cheltenham,

01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:07.481
and I never felt like I was English here, I always felt like a
foreigner here,

01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:10.361
I mean I was always in fights at school

01:35:10.641 --> 01:35:14.761
and stuff, because I always felt odd, different.

01:35:34.681 --> 01:35:36.801
That track, 'The Pandy's Are Coming',

01:35:37.081 --> 01:35:43.481
it was really about, the first step in tackling my cultural
identity crisis,

01:35:43.761 --> 01:35:47.401
which was this part of me that comes from the East,

01:35:47.681 --> 01:35:50.881
didn't sit right in England at that time.

01:35:51.161 --> 01:35:54.121
At that time, there were all these

01:35:54.401 --> 01:35:57.201
“Jaz clones" as Youth calls it,

01:35:57.481 --> 01:36:01.601
all these Asian kids with flat caps.

01:36:02.841 --> 01:36:05.761
SOUTHALL RIOTS, ANTI-RACISM DEMONSTRATION 1979

01:36:06.041 --> 01:36:08.441
Young Asians born in Great Britain they

01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:11.321
have to be like, a good boy, a good girl

01:36:11.601 --> 01:36:13.441
or otherwise, you step out of line,

01:36:13.721 --> 01:36:17.601
and they'd all run away from home all these kids.

01:36:30.121 --> 01:36:34.681
I used him as an inspiration to kids, and I say,

01:36:34.961 --> 01:36:39.841
"This boy is supposed to have failed his music O level,

01:36:40.121 --> 01:36:42.441
and yet he's able to conduct a symphony orchestra

01:36:42.721 --> 01:36:44.801
and he's never been to a music college,

01:36:45.081 --> 01:36:46.401
so what does it say?"

01:36:46.681 --> 01:36:49.361
some say, “You don't know Killing Joke';

01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:51.881
I say, “Yes I'm his Mum'; “You're his Mum?!",

01:36:52.161 --> 01:36:54.521
I think he was kind of spawned

01:36:54.801 --> 01:36:57.721
they don't think of him as having a Mum, especially someone
like me.

01:36:58.001 --> 01:37:00.281
Spawn of the devil yeah right?

01:37:02.641 --> 01:37:05.441
He's a very hot fish to handle artistically you know,

01:37:05.721 --> 01:37:08.441
he's a difficult artist to work with

01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:13.001
because he's so passionate and so uncompromising.

01:37:13.281 --> 01:37:15.521
He can be absolutely lovely Jaz Coleman,

01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:19.201
and he can be a complete and utter shit.

01:37:19.481 --> 01:37:21.201
Wake <i>up...</i>

01:37:22.241 --> 01:37:23.481
<i>Intro...</i>

01:37:23.761 --> 01:37:27.041
Even knowing him really well, you know, there always comes
a point where

01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:31.801
he starts physically threatening me or someone there, you
know,

01:37:32.081 --> 01:37:34.041
with violence.

01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:38.441
Take that fucking out, we're recording.

01:37:38.721 --> 01:37:40.801
Alright tell me where the drums... Take the last one out.

01:37:41.081 --> 01:37:43.121
It's happened on all our projects,

01:37:43.401 --> 01:37:47.841
I think on the Pink Floyd one he threatened to slash the A&R
man's face

01:37:48.121 --> 01:37:51.041
if he made one edit <i>to...</i> Oh no, that was the Zeppelin one...

01:37:51.321 --> 01:37:54.681
If he edited this twenty minute version of 'Whole Lotta Love'

01:37:54.961 --> 01:37:57.361
which we didn't use at all in the end...

01:37:58.121 --> 01:38:01.561
You know, so when he's like that there's just no reasoning
with him

01:38:01.841 --> 01:38:05.001
he just becomes a bit of a dictator and he expects everybody
just to recognise

01:38:05.281 --> 01:38:07.321
recognise his genius and do what he says.

01:38:07.601 --> 01:38:08.641
OK, brilliant, OK

01:38:08.921 --> 01:38:11.721
OK let's just fly that into the chorus,

01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:13.921
really good Jaz...

01:38:15.481 --> 01:38:19.481
Did you get all that? ...Everything!

01:38:22.281 --> 01:38:25.161
Matt and I know fine well that dealing with Jaz a lot of the
time is like,

01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:29.161
“Right, I'm going to Peru, I'm going to record, in a cave, in
Peru,

01:38:29.441 --> 01:38:32.921
to invocate something or another and <i>like...</i> that's a real
conversation.

01:38:33.201 --> 01:38:36.681
And there's a bit of you that sort of sits there and thinks,
“Why... Why do you want to go to Peru?"

01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:39.481
DO YOUR FUCKING JOB, YOU CUNT, MAKE ME SOUND LIKE
GOD

01:38:39.761 --> 01:38:44.201
When you're manage him sometimes you sit, and you look at each
other, and you're like, ”Is this guy completely fucking crazy?"

01:38:44.481 --> 01:38:46.321
And then a part of you thinks,

01:38:46.601 --> 01:38:49.601
“Or is he manipulating this entire situation?"

01:38:49.881 --> 01:38:52.681
A good example of that is the trip to Egypt;

01:38:53.641 --> 01:38:55.601
the story is just fantastic,

01:38:55.881 --> 01:38:58.401
who goes to record in the King's Chamber

01:38:58.681 --> 01:39:01.801
of the Great Pyramids of Giza? I'll tell you; nobody.

01:39:03.401 --> 01:39:08.281
If there was ever a dangerous time in your life believe it or not
it'd be now...

01:39:09.081 --> 01:39:11.121
seriously.

01:39:30.161 --> 01:39:33.441
SILENCE

01:39:38.201 --> 01:39:40.641
We wanted to do this recording in the Pyramids.

01:39:40.921 --> 01:39:45.521
Mary, our main contact, described herself as a white witch.

01:39:45.801 --> 01:39:48.761
She said she'd have to interview us

01:39:49.041 --> 01:39:52.241
to ascertain our intentions were correct.

01:39:52.521 --> 01:39:55.441
We had this interview and the guy goes, “What do you want
to do?"

01:39:55.721 --> 01:39:57.441
and Jaz goes, "I want to do an exorcism"

01:39:57.721 --> 01:40:00.601
and he goes, “You're not Satanists are you?"

01:40:00.881 --> 01:40:06.641
"I don't believe in Satan, so how can I be a Satanist?

01:40:06.921 --> 01:40:08.401
Do you?",

01:40:08.721 --> 01:40:10.881
”No I don't”

01:40:12.041 --> 01:40:14.881
and Jaz goes, “Well how can I be a Satanist?"

01:40:15.161 --> 01:40:19.121
and everybody laughed and that was it and we were in.

01:40:24.801 --> 01:40:27.921
This is where major leys start and end isn't it?

01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:29.441
On the planet earth.

01:40:29.721 --> 01:40:32.081
The Pyramids weren't sited randomly,

01:40:32.361 --> 01:40:39.161
it is indeed a huge marker peg for all the rest of the grid on
the entire planet.

01:40:39.441 --> 01:40:42.441
This is the Great Navel of the Earth,

01:40:42.721 --> 01:40:47.441
high energy; don't need drugs in here, you don't.

01:40:48.561 --> 01:40:49.721
Hello, Hello, Hello

01:40:50.001 --> 01:40:53.841
The energy is very high in Cairo and around the Pyramids.

01:40:54.121 --> 01:40:57.481
It's almost like you don't need to sleep there,

01:40:57.761 --> 01:41:00.201
Jaz thrives on that.

01:41:15.241 --> 01:41:20.201
I think we can go in the Queen's Chamber while you're doing
your vocals, OK?

01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:24.521
Jaz is going in.

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:46.001
Once you enter the King's Chamber, the harmonics in that
room are just incredible.

01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:50.441
You had to whisper to each other because it just bounces off
the walls.

01:42:00.161 --> 01:42:04.441
First battery pack we put in the DAT machines just went flat
straight away.

01:42:11.961 --> 01:42:15.161
The second battery we put in went flat straight away.

01:42:15.441 --> 01:42:18.321
The camera started playing <i>up...</i>

01:42:18.601 --> 01:42:21.921
It was a terrible session, Jaz broke down, he'd drunk too
much,

01:42:22.201 --> 01:42:23.561
there was too many people around,

01:42:23.841 --> 01:42:27.201
all this weird stuff was going on we got nothing.

01:42:27.481 --> 01:42:30.721
The next day I kind of took the reins a bit and said, look,

01:42:31.001 --> 01:42:32.521
let's do it a bit more ritually...

01:42:32.801 --> 01:42:34.041
We light the candles...

01:42:34.321 --> 01:42:37.321
...let's have three guys in the King's Chamber,

01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:40.201
everybody else can wait out in the corridors.

01:42:40.481 --> 01:42:44.641
We'll do a ceremony and we'll ritualise it and then, we'll see
what happens.

01:42:44.921 --> 01:42:47.401
In ...this moment in our lives.

01:42:47.681 --> 01:42:51.481
We come to absorb... Spirit

01:42:51.761 --> 01:42:54.601
and purify ourselves.

01:42:54.881 --> 01:42:58.161
Jaz did a prayer, saying that we came in peace

01:42:58.441 --> 01:43:01.121
and we wanted to do it in a good way.

01:43:01.401 --> 01:43:04.121
Mary and the girls had suddenly turned up at the Pyramids in
this full

01:43:04.401 --> 01:43:06.761
Egyptian ceremonial dress.

01:43:07.041 --> 01:43:08.961
<i>3217. and</i>

01:43:09.241 --> 01:43:12.641
these people around doing

01:43:12.921 --> 01:43:16.161
I think, they're doing something not right.

01:43:17.081 --> 01:43:19.601
The energy changed in the room straight away,

01:43:19.881 --> 01:43:24.041
you could cut the air with a knife.

01:43:26.441 --> 01:43:29.961
It was time when Sirius was rising in the sky in August,

01:43:30.241 --> 01:43:34.441
that really helped, and the girls held the energy down there
in the Queen's Chamber,

01:43:34.721 --> 01:43:38.521
and created the right resonance and vibration for us

01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:42.681
to access that portal.

01:43:54.121 --> 01:43:56.881
We had like, two hours of fantastic recording with

01:43:57.161 --> 01:44:02.161
Jaz bellowing from the darkest agony of his soul.

01:44:03.121 --> 01:44:05.401
I could feel myself elevating,

01:44:05.681 --> 01:44:08.961
Jaz was watching me and he was <i>like...</i> His eyes were getting
bigger and bigger and

01:44:09.241 --> 01:44:11.961
he reckons that I lifted off the ground.

01:44:44.001 --> 01:44:47.161
Our recording engineer, Sameh, was Egyptian,

01:44:47.441 --> 01:44:50.641
he'd never been in the Pyramid before, he was sort of a little
bit...

01:44:50.921 --> 01:44:55.081
Not scared but, it didn't interest him to go there, ever.

01:44:56.881 --> 01:44:59.321
At one point he nodded off.

01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:04.961
I found sleep. That's what I remember that for five minutes,
four minutes,

01:45:05.241 --> 01:45:07.521
my eyes closed.

01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:13.681
When he awoke he jumped up, hit his head on the beam

01:45:13.961 --> 01:45:16.321
and ran for the door.

01:45:18.481 --> 01:45:24.721
I stopped him and said, “Are you OK?"and he said, “Yeah, yeah
I'm fine

01:45:25.001 --> 01:45:28.201
but the Eye of Horus was coming after me.

01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:32.361
These eyes I remember them,

01:45:32.641 --> 01:45:35.321
it was shiny eyes, coming like this and

01:45:35.601 --> 01:45:38.321
would look at me and go

01:45:39.761 --> 01:45:41.481
It was scary really, actually.

01:45:41.761 --> 01:45:44.081
These eyes...

01:45:44.361 --> 01:45:47.561
It comes to my dreams many times;

01:45:48.201 --> 01:45:51.721
from this day I never go to the Pyramids again.

01:46:01.001 --> 01:46:03.641
It was a really, really powerful experience, you know,

01:46:03.921 --> 01:46:07.961
for me personally and musically it was incredible.

01:46:36.161 --> 01:46:38.681
I've known Jaz for about five years.

01:46:38.961 --> 01:46:41.441
He tried to fight me once...

01:46:41.721 --> 01:46:44.681
He was rolling his eyes around and freaking out,

01:46:44.961 --> 01:46:46.281
he was going to chop my head off.

01:46:46.561 --> 01:46:49.561
Do you know Killing Joke recorded in these Pyramids?

01:46:49.841 --> 01:46:52.441
Jaz told me all about it at the time,

01:46:52.721 --> 01:46:54.481
what a great coup

01:46:55.841 --> 01:46:59.201
This is one of the major points

01:46:59.481 --> 01:47:01.921
points of reference of history

01:47:02.201 --> 01:47:06.321
I don't believe that this is 2800bc,

01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:11.321
it's not, it's a lot older. The science isn't human,

01:47:11.601 --> 01:47:13.801
the science is mathematics that

01:47:14.081 --> 01:47:18.321
mankind is only now understanding.

01:47:18.601 --> 01:47:22.761
The whole point of our civilisation isn't human.

01:47:24.041 --> 01:47:29.681
What is this civilization about and who or what could have
created it?

01:47:29.961 --> 01:47:34.961
It's basically structured around the Tree of Life,

01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:38.561
everything that every human being knows, the way they
think

01:47:38.841 --> 01:47:41.161
think is attached to this Tree of Life,

01:47:41.441 --> 01:47:44.881
and the whole of everything that is attached to this tree,

01:47:45.161 --> 01:47:48.561
will always work for the aim of number one.

01:47:48.841 --> 01:47:53.241
One being the unity of everything that's held within it,

01:47:53.521 --> 01:47:56.961
so we're all attached to a matrix.

01:47:57.241 --> 01:47:59.041
Now this matrix, really,

01:47:59.321 --> 01:48:02.281
I mean it's very, very, very difficult to believe

01:48:02.561 --> 01:48:06.881
that any human being could ever have conceived of this.

01:48:08.321 --> 01:48:11.361
They're making something else, something big,

01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:15.201
something that none of us are going to have any free will
about

01:48:15.481 --> 01:48:18.401
we're not going to have any free will once we're attached, at
all,

01:48:18.681 --> 01:48:21.521
look at the ant, look at the termite.

01:48:21.801 --> 01:48:24.881
This is the brave new world we're entering.

01:48:28.961 --> 01:48:31.761
...there, science fiction twenty years ago

01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:34.521
but a biometric reality today.

01:48:35.481 --> 01:48:38.321
I fervently believe that the western governments,

01:48:38.601 --> 01:48:43.321
the only way that they're going to control the masses during
the changes that are going ahead,

01:48:43.601 --> 01:48:46.641
is going to be humans having implants.

01:48:46.961 --> 01:48:50.161
Technology has developed to an extent that

01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:55.081
it's a reality we're a matter of years away from the situation,

01:48:55.361 --> 01:48:58.481
I think it's beyond paranoia.

01:49:03.361 --> 01:49:07.201
NEW ZEALAND

01:49:07.481 --> 01:49:10.601
Jaz Coleman and Killing Joke record their next album in
Auckland,

01:49:10.881 --> 01:49:13.961
in Coleman's new recording studio, next month.

01:49:20.841 --> 01:49:25.841
PANDEMONIUM, A 10-PAK OF PESTILENCE

01:49:29.481 --> 01:49:31.801
KILLING JOKE HAVE RETURNED WITH A VENGEANCE,

01:49:32.081 --> 01:49:34.161
THE END MUST BE NEAR

01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:40.361
I had worked with Jaz on an album from my own band,
Shihad, he had produced that album, which

01:49:40.641 --> 01:49:42.561
which he did a fantastic job of,

01:49:42.841 --> 01:49:48.001
when Killing Joke turned up, that's when it all started going
fucking sideways.

01:49:55.441 --> 01:49:59.641
Jaz had this mike set up, I think it was called the cunt mike,

01:49:59.921 --> 01:50:03.121
it was just a microphone patched in, so he could abuse us

01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:06.401
as we were tracking drums!

01:50:06.681 --> 01:50:12.161
”Oh yeah, you've got to yell fuck at me while I play, that's fine,
you go right ahead you know.

01:50:15.081 --> 01:50:19.241
Paul Ferguson and Martin Atkins, you know, they were huge
heroes of mine

01:50:19.521 --> 01:50:21.641
who had influenced a whole series of other drummers that I
was really into,

01:50:21.921 --> 01:50:23.681
Mike Bordin, of Faith No More...

01:50:23.961 --> 01:50:28.281
It was a strange turn of events to find yourself in that cycle of
creation,

01:50:28.561 --> 01:50:30.801
after having watched it from afar

01:50:31.081 --> 01:50:32.761
and from, you know, the bottom of the world.

01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:37.161
I mean that was a genetic thread that Killing Joke started
with drumming

01:50:37.441 --> 01:50:41.921
where they brought that tribal thing into aggressive, high
energy music.

01:50:46.481 --> 01:50:49.041
READ MY APOCALYPSE

01:50:49.361 --> 01:50:53.001
A lot of people who got into Pandemonium thought it was
Killing Joke's first album,

01:50:53.281 --> 01:50:56.561
I bet that's happened to them four or five times in their
career.

01:50:56.841 --> 01:50:59.721
There's not many bands that get more and more ferocious,

01:51:00.001 --> 01:51:04.401
and harder, and more fucked up the older they get.

01:51:04.681 --> 01:51:06.921
It was back to them sounding unique,

01:51:07.201 --> 01:51:10.361
and not trying to have pop hits.

01:51:28.841 --> 01:51:30.681
PANDEMONIUM IS WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A
WORK-IN-PROGRESS...

01:51:30.961 --> 01:51:33.401
GOD KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF IT IS EVER COMPLETED

01:51:33.681 --> 01:51:35.841
Youth sort of reappeared,

01:51:36.121 --> 01:51:41.521
there was sort of confusion as to whether it was Youth and
Raven, or, was Raven out, or what now?

01:51:41.801 --> 01:51:44.881
Again it was that thing of chaos in the background.

01:51:45.161 --> 01:51:47.201
We're coming from all different directions

01:51:47.481 --> 01:51:51.521
directions and, you know, for a while it only worked when we
played music,

01:51:51.801 --> 01:51:54.841
and the rest of the time there was a bunch of turbulence. <i>..</i>

01:51:55.121 --> 01:51:57.441
still is.

01:51:58.801 --> 01:52:02.481
Youth's sort of popped in and out of the band over the years
really.

01:52:02.761 --> 01:52:04.921
Youth came to me and said “I want to get another band
together",

01:52:05.201 --> 01:52:07.841
I said “Well what do you want to do that for? You should be a
producer",

01:52:08.121 --> 01:52:10.841
and he said, ”Oh, you think I should be a producer?", I said,
”Yeah, you could be.",

01:52:11.121 --> 01:52:13.321
he's made a great career out of being that.

01:52:13.601 --> 01:52:17.361
Youth produced everything from Urban Hymns

01:52:17.641 --> 01:52:18.841
to Paul McCartney,

01:52:19.121 --> 01:52:24.281
I think the records... Not all the time, bearing in mind Night
Time was nothing to do with Youth, you know...

01:52:24.561 --> 01:52:28.961
but I think that when he comes back in, even if he's not firmly
at the controls of it,

01:52:29.241 --> 01:52:31.881
even if he's not literally the guy on the desk turning it,

01:52:32.161 --> 01:52:37.161
he sort of puts a bit of something into it... A bit of producer
magic into it.

01:52:37.441 --> 01:52:39.201
Youth's making money!

01:52:39.481 --> 01:52:42.361
I said to him, “Oh, I bet you're quite chuffed then", because,
like, you know

01:52:42.641 --> 01:52:45.761
he did the Verve album and the first two singles go straight to
number 1.

01:52:46.041 --> 01:52:50.001
And he kind of sits there, sort of, ”Yeah mate", you know what
he's like.

01:52:50.281 --> 01:52:54.601
He's the guy, that, when all the rest of them aren't talking to
each other for whatever reason,

01:52:54.881 --> 01:52:57.921
they all still talk to Youth.

01:52:58.201 --> 01:52:59.801
Taking that symbol,

01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:03.641
we use the water, the sign of Christ,

01:53:03.921 --> 01:53:07.281
1999 YORK STREET STUDIOS OPENING

01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:09.761
To cleanse it.

01:53:10.041 --> 01:53:11.961
He came in like a bull at the gate,

01:53:12.241 --> 01:53:16.681
trying to, I don't know, stir emotions, stir something.

01:53:16.961 --> 01:53:18.521
I want to start the debate in this country;

01:53:18.801 --> 01:53:20.761
what is Kiwi music?

01:53:21.041 --> 01:53:24.361
And he set up York Street Studios with the help of a few other
people,

01:53:24.641 --> 01:53:27.801
which really gave a boost to New Zealand music, I mean,

01:53:28.081 --> 01:53:30.801
they would never admit to that.

01:53:36.401 --> 01:53:37.921
I first met Jaz

01:53:38.201 --> 01:53:41.841
at the opening of the York Street Recording Studio,

01:53:42.121 --> 01:53:45.281
he was really keen to do some recording together...

01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:48.921
...and he was really adamant when we first worked on
Oceania

01:53:49.201 --> 01:53:52.761
that that music was to be about

01:53:53.041 --> 01:53:55.841
the essence of this country.

01:53:57.681 --> 01:54:03.041
He didn't really care what people thought of him, it seemed.

01:54:04.321 --> 01:54:10.921
A real, sincere desire to understand the indigenous people
and the culture

01:54:11.201 --> 01:54:12.361
<i>was very apparent,</i>

01:54:12.641 --> 01:54:16.681
because I don't think in the early 90's we were really doing
that

01:54:16.961 --> 01:54:18.601
as a general thing,

01:54:18.881 --> 01:54:21.841
and I think that was,

01:54:22.121 --> 01:54:25.761
kind of, punctuated, when I sang the national anthem in
Maori

01:54:26.041 --> 01:54:27.721
at the Rugby World Cup,

01:54:28.001 --> 01:54:31.721
because the response to that was so extraordinary.

01:54:33.521 --> 01:54:37.241
“Men of every creed and race, gather here before thy face",

01:54:37.521 --> 01:54:41.201
that's how the second verse of 'God Defend New Zealand'
starts.

01:54:41.481 --> 01:54:43.801
Ironic, then, that when the Maori Hinewehi Mohi

01:54:44.081 --> 01:54:46.681
delivered her national song at Twickenham on Saturday

01:54:46.961 --> 01:54:50.321
it didn't go down well with thousands of New Zealand rugby
fans...

01:54:50.601 --> 01:54:54.281
This representative of the Rugby Union came and said,

01:54:54.561 --> 01:54:57.281
“We'd really like you to do an English version';

01:54:57.561 --> 01:54:59.001
and Jaz goes, “NO!

01:54:59.281 --> 01:55:02.121
She only knows that version and that's the version she's
going to do"

01:55:02.441 --> 01:55:04.881
What is the point of singing a national anthem in a language

01:55:05.161 --> 01:55:07.241
that most of the population can't understand?

01:55:07.521 --> 01:55:11.201
The decision to sing it in Maori was a musical decision, not a
political one,

01:55:11.481 --> 01:55:14.241
it's just that, I mean, you've got to listen to this girl's voice...

01:55:14.521 --> 01:55:18.401
“You can't be singing it in English, you've got to be singing it
in Maori

01:55:18.681 --> 01:55:20.161
because we've got to make that statement"

01:55:20.441 --> 01:55:23.681
It's all about music you know, this is the issue...

01:55:23.961 --> 01:55:28.161
if he's feeling passionate about that needing to be made as a
statement,

01:55:28.441 --> 01:55:30.881
then I smell trouble!

01:55:31.161 --> 01:55:35.921
But I didn't smell the trouble to the extent that it panned out.

01:55:36.201 --> 01:55:39.041
It suddenly turned into this controversy

01:55:39.321 --> 01:55:44.641
I suddenly realised that we weren't so far along with our
cultural understanding

01:55:44.921 --> 01:55:47.921
as I would have liked us to have been.

01:55:48.201 --> 01:55:51.561
This is your CD! ...OK! That's enough plugging!

01:55:51.841 --> 01:55:57.881
Jaz was really delighted because he copes with controversy
so much better than me!

01:55:58.161 --> 01:56:02.521
He'd make a good politician, because politicians have that
two sides to them, you know,

01:56:02.801 --> 01:56:08.201
he can play the game, Jaz can do that... He wouldn't make a
good priest.

01:56:14.921 --> 01:56:17.681
This was on the Gathering message board,

01:56:17.961 --> 01:56:22.121
"I heard recently, that Jaz had found God."

01:56:22.401 --> 01:56:25.201
We can't escape what we are,

01:56:25.481 --> 01:56:27.841
far better to study our holy texts...

01:56:28.121 --> 01:56:32.041
“The sun is rising in the east, the beginning of a new day for
mankind,

01:56:32.321 --> 01:56:34.801
my eyes were open to see the divine mysteries

01:56:35.081 --> 01:56:37.121
of the church of Killing Joke,

01:56:37.401 --> 01:56:39.641
the chosen anointed prophet of God,

01:56:39.921 --> 01:56:43.401
Jeremy Jaz Coleman, beloved of the most high",

01:56:43.681 --> 01:56:49.041
Now if you fucking put me in this film that that's coming from
me you're fucking dead I tell you!

01:56:49.321 --> 01:56:52.881
Ateh, Malkuth, ve-Geburah, ve-Gedulah, le-Olam,

01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:57.721
we have a fifty percent chance of survival to the end of the
century...

01:56:58.001 --> 01:56:59.161
Give me strength...

01:56:59.441 --> 01:57:02.401
The male sperm count is getting lower and lower...

01:57:02.681 --> 01:57:05.841
We are, as males, an extinct species...

01:57:06.121 --> 01:57:08.561
The elite are preparing for the inevitable...

01:57:08.841 --> 01:57:13.321
and Jesus entered the temple, and began to drive out those
who sold...

01:57:13.601 --> 01:57:15.961
Christ said, "I come not

01:57:17.641 --> 01:57:20.601
the olive branch but with a sword!"

01:57:27.721 --> 01:57:31.201
If we look at the Old Testament, in the cold light of day,

01:57:31.481 --> 01:57:33.761
in relation...

01:57:34.041 --> 01:57:35.961
to the UFO issue.

01:57:36.241 --> 01:57:39.481
Genesis chapter 6, verse <i>4...</i>

01:57:39.761 --> 01:57:43.121
“And there were giants in the earth in those days and when
the sons of God...

01:57:43.401 --> 01:57:46.361
came in unto the daughters of men,

01:57:46.641 --> 01:57:50.361
great men were born men of renown.

01:57:50.641 --> 01:57:54.041
And so we have the argument of the interventionists, so. <i>..</i>

01:57:54.321 --> 01:57:58.841
Oh, you want to hear an amazing dream I had? Listen to this,
here's one of my favorite UFO dreams...

01:57:59.121 --> 01:58:03.281
it was kind of a harbour... the sky, like, fucking
imploded...

01:58:03.561 --> 01:58:07.721
you could see all of these different spacecraft shooting
from side to side,

01:58:08.001 --> 01:58:10.801
UFOs everywhere... Like Fatima... all over the place...

01:58:11.081 --> 01:58:12.881
Holy fucking shit...

01:58:13.161 --> 01:58:16.961
They started showing these, propaganda films...

01:58:17.241 --> 01:58:20.681
it was finally explaining the evolution of man,

01:58:20.961 --> 01:58:25.761
and how it was aided by these, aliens.

01:58:26.041 --> 01:58:27.361
Here!

01:58:27.641 --> 01:58:30.801
Cheers.

01:58:32.081 --> 01:58:34.281
I got to take a piss.

01:58:51.121 --> 01:58:53.921
Jaz can be many people with his singing,

01:58:54.201 --> 01:58:57.921
and he just decided to be, you know, the voice of Satan;

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.641
THE MOST VICIOUS ALBUM OF THE YEAR

01:59:03.921 --> 01:59:07.921
That was an incredible album. I really, really thought that was
an incredibly powerful album.

01:59:08.201 --> 01:59:10.441
Andy Gill from the Gang of Four produced it,

01:59:10.721 --> 01:59:13.121
Youth played on it, Dave Grohl was on drums.

01:59:13.401 --> 01:59:16.761
I'm just doing the drums, they've finished the whole record...

01:59:17.041 --> 01:59:20.641
Yeah it's the first record I've ever done where the drums come
last.

01:59:24.001 --> 01:59:26.041
Grohl's drumming was, funnily enough

01:59:26.321 --> 01:59:30.121
it's almost like a, an amalgam of Martin Atkins and Big Paul's,

01:59:30.401 --> 01:59:34.041
because it has that technical proficiency that Atkins has, and
that sort of strangeness,

01:59:34.321 --> 01:59:36.801
combined with the sheer wallop that Big Paul has.

01:59:37.081 --> 01:59:39.801
Full volume! Yeah.

01:59:41.001 --> 01:59:44.881
When I heard that Dave Grohl was playing drums,

01:59:45.161 --> 01:59:48.681
I thought, “Yeah bollocks, another fucking Jaz and Geordie
scam';

01:59:48.961 --> 01:59:52.041
but, if anyone can do it, they can do <i>it...</i>

01:59:52.321 --> 01:59:53.481
Eh Dave?

01:59:53.761 --> 01:59:55.641
Here you go, here you go.

01:59:55.921 --> 01:59:57.761
This ones for

01:59:58.041 --> 01:59:59.961
for the God of Fertility.

02:00:00.241 --> 02:00:04.041
Call up, get through, and say, “Oi, you cunt, you fucking, you
owe us

02:00:04.321 --> 02:00:07.481
for that fucking song that made you <i>so...</i> I want you to play
drums!"

02:00:07.761 --> 02:00:10.081
What about Eighties? Look in the camera!

02:00:10.361 --> 02:00:11.441
Look in the camera!

02:00:11.721 --> 02:00:15.041
What the fuck are we going to do about Eighties?

02:00:15.321 --> 02:00:18.201
Dave Grohl did it for nothing,

02:00:18.481 --> 02:00:21.321
you know, I mean, was Nirvana influenced by Killing Joke?
Absolutely.

02:00:24.361 --> 02:00:26.201
We were all blown away,

02:00:26.481 --> 02:00:29.481
someone said, like, here's that new Killing Joke...

02:00:29.761 --> 02:00:31.601
Put it into the CD,

02:00:31.881 --> 02:00:36.321
it was what we listened to every night before we would go on
stage.

02:00:36.601 --> 02:00:40.001
Every night we would listen to that fucking CD, those six
songs,

02:00:40.281 --> 02:00:44.721
to the point where, when we hit the stage we were already
sweating.

02:00:55.601 --> 02:00:57.361
Ha ha <i>ha...</i>

02:01:37.121 --> 02:01:40.801
You tell him I'm an asteroid, fuck you.

02:01:50.241 --> 02:01:53.401
A friend of mine was playing keyboards for Killing Joke...

02:01:53.681 --> 02:01:57.081
he started getting quite scared about, I think, touring with
these guys,

02:01:57.361 --> 02:02:00.201
and he asked me about taking over for a couple of tours here
and there

02:02:00.481 --> 02:02:03.761
while he was doing other things and so I decided to do <i>it...</i>

02:02:04.041 --> 02:02:06.041
Joined the band in Prague,

02:02:06.321 --> 02:02:09.481
and even being driven from the airport to the studio

02:02:09.761 --> 02:02:13.841
studio the person driving me was saying, “Are you sure you're
ready for this?"

02:02:22.201 --> 02:02:27.081
After the whole national anthem thing at the Rugby World
Cup

02:02:27.361 --> 02:02:29.561
things got pretty ugly,

02:02:29.841 --> 02:02:34.161
and I got death threats from rednecks in New Zealand.

02:02:34.441 --> 02:02:39.041
Killing Joke had played in Prague very shortly after the
revolution,

02:02:39.321 --> 02:02:42.401
and I wanted to return to Prague.

02:02:44.481 --> 02:02:47.921
After this things happened at breakneck speed

02:02:48.201 --> 02:02:49.481
The Prague Symphony Orchestra

02:02:49.801 --> 02:02:53.361
offered me the position of Composer in Residence

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:58.561
I ended up doing the Cechomor album,'Promeny',

02:02:58.841 --> 02:03:00.161
which went on to get

02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:02.241
three Grammys,

02:03:02.521 --> 02:03:04.121
a movie was made about it

02:03:04.401 --> 02:03:06.241
that won the Carlsbad

02:03:06.521 --> 02:03:09.081
International Film Festival.

02:03:09.361 --> 02:03:10.761
And behind all

02:03:11.041 --> 02:03:12.881
the veneer of

02:03:13.161 --> 02:03:14.841
going to Prague because it's

02:03:15.121 --> 02:03:17.561
a Mecca for great composers like

02:03:17.841 --> 02:03:19.401
Mozart and Beethoven,

02:03:20.241 --> 02:03:22.401
was the fact that Prague,

02:03:22.681 --> 02:03:23.881
the Golden City,

02:03:24.161 --> 02:03:26.241
held the secrets of the mystery tradition,

02:03:26.521 --> 02:03:28.641
and at the heart of this city,

02:03:28.921 --> 02:03:31.681
the birth of the Rosicrucian tradition,

02:03:31.961 --> 02:03:33.881
and the mysteries of

02:03:34.161 --> 02:03:36.241
life and death itself.

02:03:43.081 --> 02:03:44.841
Here at Obecni Dum

02:03:45.121 --> 02:03:46.841
we are no more than forty metres from

02:03:47.121 --> 02:03:48.921
the Black Madonna of Celetna.

02:03:49.201 --> 02:03:50.841
These Black Madonnas

02:03:51.121 --> 02:03:53.281
have curious properties,

02:03:53.561 --> 02:03:54.761
the Knights Templar

02:03:55.041 --> 02:03:57.241
situated them over underground streams

02:03:57.521 --> 02:04:00.441
following similar principles of acupuncture,

02:04:00.721 --> 02:04:02.681
like needles going into the veins

02:04:02.961 --> 02:04:04.081
of the body of the god;

02:04:04.361 --> 02:04:06.321
releases energy.

02:04:08.521 --> 02:04:10.801
All who live here,

02:04:12.241 --> 02:04:14.801
all their thoughts are amplified.

02:04:17.321 --> 02:04:18.361
Of course,

02:04:18.641 --> 02:04:21.241
the energy in these areas

02:04:22.001 --> 02:04:23.841
sends some people mad.

02:05:05.801 --> 02:05:09.081
Blood was shed during that album and not like,

02:05:09.361 --> 02:05:11.561
fisticuffs and tea cups;

02:05:11.841 --> 02:05:13.681
they fucked each other up at times

02:05:13.961 --> 02:05:14.561
during that record,

02:05:14.841 --> 02:05:16.761
the drummer nearly couldn't play drums anymore

02:05:17.041 --> 02:05:18.721
particular incident, you know,

02:05:19.001 --> 02:05:21.201
it was pretty dark.

02:05:22.921 --> 02:05:24.721
I don't play that album anymore

02:05:25.001 --> 02:05:26.041
because it's quite stressful to listen <i>to...</i>

02:05:26.321 --> 02:05:27.641
I've never listened to it once.

02:05:29.921 --> 02:05:31.921
It was an insane recording

02:05:32.201 --> 02:05:34.321
where everybody went absolutely crazy

02:05:34.601 --> 02:05:36.321
in Prague on every level.

02:05:36.601 --> 02:05:38.441
There was drugs and alcohol,

02:05:38.721 --> 02:05:40.321
a lot of things in the mix at that time.

02:05:40.601 --> 02:05:42.321
It was a non stop binge pretty much

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:43.561
for the first few months.

02:05:46.601 --> 02:05:49.281
Blind drunk or argumentative is Jaz Coleman and Geordie,

02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:50.321
that's it,

02:05:51.161 --> 02:05:53.841
yeah I think they have a self destruct button.

02:06:01.201 --> 02:06:02.561
Jaz Coleman,

02:06:02.881 --> 02:06:03.201
<i>Ya...</i>

02:06:03.561 --> 02:06:05.121
the man they call Jaz Coleman anyway...

02:06:05.401 --> 02:06:07.121
oh look...

02:06:07.401 --> 02:06:08.521
All Blacks.

02:06:08.801 --> 02:06:09.521
When Paul left,

02:06:09.801 --> 02:06:12.081
right before we went on tour with Hosannas,

02:06:12.361 --> 02:06:14.081
he went and joined Ministry,

02:06:14.361 --> 02:06:16.321
which caused a lot of friction in the band.

02:06:16.601 --> 02:06:18.681
That's three times he's done this to me

02:06:18.961 --> 02:06:20.561
in twenty four years.

02:06:20.841 --> 02:06:23.161
How do you think I feel?

02:06:23.441 --> 02:06:26.241
He cares nothing for friendship.

02:06:27.841 --> 02:06:29.721
He tried to fuck us,

02:06:30.001 --> 02:06:31.121
and more than that,

02:06:31.401 --> 02:06:33.121
he tried to take our keyboard player

02:06:33.401 --> 02:06:35.481
for the Ministry tour.

02:06:36.361 --> 02:06:39.081
He tried to kill Killing Joke,

02:06:42.481 --> 02:06:45.121
and if I ever see him,

02:06:45.401 --> 02:06:47.241
either I die,

02:06:47.521 --> 02:06:49.041
or he dies.

02:06:57.561 --> 02:06:59.681
Paul had left a number of times

02:06:59.961 --> 02:07:01.921
it was part of what happened in Killing Joke you know,

02:07:02.201 --> 02:07:03.961
so, there was always an expectation

02:07:04.241 --> 02:07:05.841
that Paul would come back at some point.

02:07:06.121 --> 02:07:08.481
Raven would return to that band after

02:07:08.761 --> 02:07:10.481
terrible things have happened between them,

02:07:10.761 --> 02:07:12.121
I remember him talking about

02:07:12.401 --> 02:07:14.641
the Outside the Gate album and how, you know,

02:07:14.921 --> 02:07:16.641
Jaz was obviously using Gematria

02:07:16.921 --> 02:07:18.281
and Raven said,

02:07:18.561 --> 02:07:19.641
“lf you want a hit record phone Stock,

02:07:19.921 --> 02:07:21.641
Aitken and Waterman, don't phone the Devil.

02:07:21.921 --> 02:07:23.641
And then they're playing together again on

02:07:23.921 --> 02:07:26.001
Various Repressed Emotions.

02:07:26.281 --> 02:07:28.761
It's a love/hate thing it's not just...

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:30.521
It's family basically,

02:07:30.801 --> 02:07:32.721
once it's family there's no escape from it,

02:07:33.001 --> 02:07:34.721
it's there forever,

02:07:35.001 --> 02:07:37.121
and Raven was a latecomer but...

02:07:49.881 --> 02:07:51.121
I think Raven's death

02:07:51.401 --> 02:07:53.521
was such a shock to everyone,

02:07:53.801 --> 02:07:55.361
it's one of those things which

02:07:55.641 --> 02:07:56.921
which makes everybody take stock

02:07:57.201 --> 02:07:58.361
and think about this thing

02:07:58.641 --> 02:08:00.281
which is Killing Joke.

02:08:04.641 --> 02:08:07.921
When that obituary went out it was published...

02:08:08.201 --> 02:08:09.841
online and offline

02:08:10.121 --> 02:08:11.841
on just about every publication

02:08:12.121 --> 02:08:13.161
on the planet.

02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:16.321
We always knew the reach of the band,

02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:19.561
but I think we sort of looked at each other and thought,

02:08:19.841 --> 02:08:22.361
blimey, it's like people really

02:08:22.641 --> 02:08:23.881
do give a fuck about this band

02:08:24.161 --> 02:08:25.961
and they really did give a fuck about Paul.

02:08:26.241 --> 02:08:27.961
Ah, that's great actually.

02:08:28.241 --> 02:08:29.961
Yeah, my lettering, thanks Mike,

02:08:30.241 --> 02:08:31.601
thanks for the fucking nod in.

02:08:31.881 --> 02:08:32.961
We used to have this phrase,

02:08:33.241 --> 02:08:36.081
"walking at a thousand miles an hour towards death

02:08:36.361 --> 02:08:37.641
and together we both go,

02:08:37.921 --> 02:08:40.041
grinning as we go.

02:08:40.961 --> 02:08:42.921
Because death is like, always around the corner and

02:08:43.201 --> 02:08:44.921
people are always passing but

02:08:45.201 --> 02:08:46.641
I didn't, kind of,

02:08:46.921 --> 02:08:49.041
foresee the youngest of us going.

02:08:54.121 --> 02:08:56.721
Paul lived his life like a pirate so I think

02:08:57.001 --> 02:08:58.721
we'd all be lying if we said that,

02:08:59.001 --> 02:09:00.721
yes it was a shock, but, you know...

02:09:01.001 --> 02:09:03.241
In hindsight, you know,

02:09:05.201 --> 02:09:07.281
Paul lived the way that he liked to live.

02:09:07.561 --> 02:09:09.201
Obviously it was sadder

02:09:09.481 --> 02:09:11.201
for the family and for his kids

02:09:11.481 --> 02:09:12.121
than it was for Paul,

02:09:12.401 --> 02:09:13.681
but you know, you're big boys

02:09:13.961 --> 02:09:15.361
you know the game.

02:09:15.641 --> 02:09:16.321
Looks just like you mate.

02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:18.081
Thanks.

02:09:18.361 --> 02:09:19.761
What do I make of Paul?

02:09:20.041 --> 02:09:22.201
I miss him,

02:09:25.441 --> 02:09:26.521
had some fucking...

02:09:26.841 --> 02:09:27.201
'excuse me,

02:09:27.561 --> 02:09:29.161
had some really beautiful times with him.

02:09:29.441 --> 02:09:31.121
In his own way he had a

02:09:31.401 --> 02:09:34.441
a really magnetic, bass playing,

02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:35.841
Capricorn,

02:09:36.121 --> 02:09:37.721
walk all over you but I'll love you,

02:09:38.001 --> 02:09:39.721
way about him;

02:09:40.001 --> 02:09:41.121
I love the man.

02:09:53.321 --> 02:09:54.761
Great to see you.

02:09:57.401 --> 02:10:00.521
After Paul had died and we were in Geneva,

02:10:00.801 --> 02:10:02.961
the first time Jaz and Paul had seen each other

02:10:03.241 --> 02:10:05.041
for a large number of years at that point.

02:10:05.321 --> 02:10:07.441
Killing Joke had been a pain

02:10:07.721 --> 02:10:10.161
in the pit of my stomach for years.

02:10:11.201 --> 02:10:14.361
Every year, without fail,

02:10:14.641 --> 02:10:17.321
something would come along

02:10:17.601 --> 02:10:19.881
that would just needle the hell out of me.

02:10:20.161 --> 02:10:22.361
It would be a new record, a new tour,

02:10:22.681 --> 02:10:24.521
a different drummer, this, that and the other,

02:10:24.801 --> 02:10:26.521
it was exhausting me,

02:10:26.801 --> 02:10:28.041
because,

02:10:28.321 --> 02:10:30.121
when I could stomach it,

02:10:30.401 --> 02:10:32.441
I'd listen to a record,

02:10:32.721 --> 02:10:34.881
and it was like nothing had changed

02:10:35.161 --> 02:10:38.081
and I felt like I was on the record.

02:10:38.361 --> 02:10:40.281
The only thing I'd ever played,

02:10:40.561 --> 02:10:42.481
really, for was Killing Joke,

02:10:42.761 --> 02:10:45.841
you know, don't ask me to join a cover band.

02:10:46.121 --> 02:10:49.241
So I went and pursued my other interests

02:10:49.521 --> 02:10:52.681
of art restoration

02:10:52.961 --> 02:10:55.841
and I put down sticks.

02:10:58.801 --> 02:11:01.801
It was only when Raven died

02:11:02.081 --> 02:11:04.601
that I realised I'd let it go,

02:11:05.801 --> 02:11:07.761
once I'd let it go

02:11:08.041 --> 02:11:09.761
it was no problem to see Jaz,

02:11:10.041 --> 02:11:13.201
and there we were, it was a funeral for our brother...

02:11:16.281 --> 02:11:17.841
Geordie said, “Well,

02:11:18.121 --> 02:11:19.921
do you fancy giving it another kick?"

02:11:20.201 --> 02:11:21.521
and I said, ”Yeah, yeah",

02:11:21.801 --> 02:11:24.081
not really taking it that seriously,

02:11:24.361 --> 02:11:26.441
and then of course, they were serious.
and then of course, they were serious.

02:11:26.721 --> 02:11:28.521
Paul said to me, "Well,

02:11:29.241 --> 02:11:31.521
took me ten years of therapy to get over that lot,

02:11:31.801 --> 02:11:32.241
you know what I mean?

02:11:32.521 --> 02:11:34.481
And now you're asking me to come back in!”

02:11:37.401 --> 02:11:38.601
On a very sad occasion

02:11:38.881 --> 02:11:40.081
it was good that something good came out of it.

02:11:40.361 --> 02:11:42.081
It's the ritual you see?

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:44.961
Seriously, that's what they really believe,

02:11:45.241 --> 02:11:47.161
that that ritual that started them

02:11:47.441 --> 02:11:49.201
is what brings them back together

02:11:49.481 --> 02:11:51.561
and ultimately completes the circle.

02:12:05.321 --> 02:12:07.441
Raven had always said to me,

02:12:07.721 --> 02:12:10.761
“Jaz, if you get the chance to do the original line up do it!"

02:12:12.161 --> 02:12:15.481
so it felt like, kind of,

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.241
the whole thing was blessed by him.

02:12:17.521 --> 02:12:18.721
I felt his presence

02:12:19.521 --> 02:12:20.721
with me

02:12:22.481 --> 02:12:23.361
at this time,

02:12:23.641 --> 02:12:25.921
I felt him in the room, this presence.

02:12:26.201 --> 02:12:28.881
Absolute Dissent put in somewhere?

02:12:29.161 --> 02:12:30.801
What about something like Exit?

02:12:33.041 --> 02:12:35.681
When Paul first joined I thought he was deliberately putting
sticks

02:12:35.961 --> 02:12:36.961
in the wheels of things,

02:12:37.241 --> 02:12:39.121
you really, almost, couldn't do anything,

02:12:39.401 --> 02:12:41.201
without Paul going, like

02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:43.081
"I'm not into that"or whatever else...

02:12:43.361 --> 02:12:44.481
You suddenly had the realisation,

02:12:44.761 --> 02:12:46.641
”You really are Killing Jake's drummer aren't you?"

02:12:46.921 --> 02:12:49.561
But the intensity of the four of them's relationship,

02:12:49.841 --> 02:12:51.121
even if they were just mates

02:12:51.401 --> 02:12:52.321
that worked in a factory,

02:12:52.601 --> 02:12:54.121
it's very full on

02:12:54.401 --> 02:12:56.281
and they've had massive effects,

02:12:56.561 --> 02:12:57.761
positively and negatively,

02:12:58.041 --> 02:12:59.201
on each other's lives,

02:12:59.481 --> 02:13:01.201
and Paul coming back into the fold,

02:13:01.481 --> 02:13:03.401
he was just trying to map out

02:13:03.681 --> 02:13:05.801
every little thing so he didn't get fucked.

02:13:06.081 --> 02:13:07.921
And I don't mean get fucked by the three of the band

02:13:08.201 --> 02:13:09.041
or by us two,

02:13:09.321 --> 02:13:10.001
but like,

02:13:10.281 --> 02:13:12.561
in his head almost, so he didn't let himself go

02:13:12.841 --> 02:13:14.761
down one of the corridors

02:13:15.041 --> 02:13:16.401
that he'd been down in the past.

02:13:25.401 --> 02:13:28.601
It's an absurd thing to have been away from

02:13:28.881 --> 02:13:31.721
a rock band for so long,

02:13:32.001 --> 02:13:34.481
to step back into this world,

02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.201
but I felt that

02:13:37.481 --> 02:13:39.481
we could see if we could find

02:13:39.761 --> 02:13:42.801
a common ground again to express

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:45.281
the things that I need to express in life,

02:13:45.561 --> 02:13:47.281
with the way things are going

02:13:47.561 --> 02:13:49.401
with the corporate elite,

02:13:49.681 --> 02:13:51.161
with the

02:13:51.441 --> 02:13:53.641
police state that we're living in.

02:13:54.681 --> 02:13:57.001
I want to hammer out the drums and scream

02:13:57.281 --> 02:13:58.481
with rage...

02:14:00.921 --> 02:14:03.801
and that's where Killing Joke started

02:14:04.081 --> 02:14:05.801
and!

02:14:06.081 --> 02:14:08.681
That's why I'm back, you know.

02:14:18.521 --> 02:14:21.481
I remember asking Jaz, what it was about

02:14:21.761 --> 02:14:23.921
Killing Joke's music that kept people coming back,

02:14:24.201 --> 02:14:25.921
and Jaz saying,

02:14:26.201 --> 02:14:28.601
“Oh you're talking about the fifth member",

02:14:28.881 --> 02:14:30.401
and I said, ”Am I?"

02:14:30.681 --> 02:14:34.601
and he said, “Yes, when I talk about my managers

02:14:34.881 --> 02:14:37.561
people think I'm talking about somebody made of flesh and
blood,

02:14:37.841 --> 02:14:39.081
that's not what I'm talking about.

02:14:39.361 --> 02:14:41.081
If you know the fifth member

02:14:41.361 --> 02:14:42.241
then

02:14:42.521 --> 02:14:45.241
you will keep coming back to him or Killing Joke."

02:14:45.521 --> 02:14:47.761
The fifth member being?

02:14:48.481 --> 02:14:49.761
The Force.

02:14:52.521 --> 02:14:54.521
In a way it made sense, because,

02:14:54.801 --> 02:14:56.521
you know, I'd been listening to this music

02:14:56.801 --> 02:14:57.841
since I was fourteen years old,

02:14:58.121 --> 02:14:59.961
and I kept coming back.

02:15:04.561 --> 02:15:07.081
Just about everybody in Killing Joke has been sent mad,

02:15:07.361 --> 02:15:09.081
has been burnt by this fire,

02:15:09.361 --> 02:15:10.481
and!

02:15:10.761 --> 02:15:11.921
I've got to be honest

02:15:12.201 --> 02:15:14.401
I was really angry and I felt that

02:15:14.681 --> 02:15:16.801
Paul had betrayed us but...

02:15:18.801 --> 02:15:23.081
That can't explain the entirety of Paul

02:15:23.361 --> 02:15:25.081
and all the years, I probably spent more time with him

02:15:25.361 --> 02:15:27.481
than any other human being on the planet.

02:15:32.001 --> 02:15:35.361
Prepared myself for Pradakshina, or Giri Valam,

02:15:35.641 --> 02:15:37.361
which is, basically, you walk around

02:15:37.641 --> 02:15:40.721
the fifty two shrines of the Holy Mountain

02:15:41.001 --> 02:15:42.961
in south India.

02:15:43.241 --> 02:15:44.761
And I took Paul's ashes

02:15:45.041 --> 02:15:48.441
to the High Priest at the temple,

02:15:48.721 --> 02:15:49.641
and!

02:15:49.921 --> 02:15:52.081
And, they did this huge fire ritual

02:15:52.361 --> 02:15:54.121
to Agni,

02:15:54.401 --> 02:15:56.681
and then I got taken to this river,

02:15:56.961 --> 02:15:59.521
and I put the flowers in the river,

02:15:59.801 --> 02:16:01.681
the sacred river

02:16:01.961 --> 02:16:04.441
and I let Paul's ashes go.

02:16:10.401 --> 02:16:13.041
And then I knew he'd got through,

02:16:13.321 --> 02:16:15.521
right the way to the other side.

02:16:50.841 --> 02:16:54.281
In '81, '82, when

02:16:54.561 --> 02:16:57.441
I became inflamed by this idea,

02:16:58.481 --> 02:17:01.481
my colleagues were well aware of it,

02:17:01.761 --> 02:17:03.880
and everyone thought I was,

02:17:04.161 --> 02:17:06.721
justifiably, mad.

02:17:07.721 --> 02:17:10.281
Examining all the different references

02:17:10.561 --> 02:17:11.800
to the island,

02:17:12.081 --> 02:17:14.601
references to a southern island in

02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:16.441
Dante's Divine Comedy,

02:17:16.721 --> 02:17:19.040
Francis Bacon's New Atlantis,

02:17:19.321 --> 02:17:21.681
where he describes an island, again,

02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:22.960
in the Pacific,

02:17:23.241 --> 02:17:25.361
that would survive the great combustion.

02:17:26.361 --> 02:17:28.521
The reference to an island

02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.361
in Crowley's Book of the Law.

02:17:30.641 --> 02:17:32.200
Then there was the Fulcanelli Group

02:17:32.521 --> 02:17:34.200
in The Mystery of the Cathedrals

02:17:34.481 --> 02:17:35.321
where they refer to

02:17:35.601 --> 02:17:38.601
the Northern Hemisphere being destroyed by fire...

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.521
The island is imaginary but periodically

02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:44.521
it has a reflex action on the Earth...

02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.521
...and that island, Cythera,

02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:48.241
becomes very real,

02:17:48.521 --> 02:17:49.921
and the players in the dream

02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.001
become gods,

02:17:51.281 --> 02:17:53.161
and that,

02:17:53.441 --> 02:17:55.001
that's my reality,

02:17:55.281 --> 02:17:57.641
and everybody has to accept that

02:17:57.921 --> 02:17:59.601
a madman's dreams

02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:02.681
not only became true but engulfed them also.

02:18:06.721 --> 02:18:08.521
One interview I did with them

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:11.281
he said,“I've found Killing Joke island",

02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:14.161
as the Gatherer's now call it.

02:18:14.441 --> 02:18:15.120
And he said, “Mum!

02:18:15.441 --> 02:18:16.321
I've found it."

02:18:16.601 --> 02:18:17.841
Geordie found the place didn't he?

02:18:18.161 --> 02:18:20.481
Because they're fishermen they like to fish,

02:18:20.761 --> 02:18:24.721
that's where Jeremy found his way he said.

02:18:26.321 --> 02:18:28.441
Choose ye an island, fortify it;

02:18:28.721 --> 02:18:30.120
well I mean he said that several times...

02:18:30.401 --> 02:18:32.281
<i>...he</i> believed that island was here in New Zealand,

02:18:32.561 --> 02:18:34.120
and I believe that too.

02:18:36.681 --> 02:18:39.161
There's all sorts of legends about New Zealand

02:18:39.441 --> 02:18:41.800
being an ancient part of that motherland,

02:18:42.081 --> 02:18:45.120
and also legends about volcanic activity

02:18:45.401 --> 02:18:47.681
and land rising again too,

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:50.960
and some of these things I've checked out scientifically,

02:18:51.241 --> 02:18:51.960
So,

02:18:52.241 --> 02:18:54.321
it's not a matter of if it's going to happen,

02:18:54.601 --> 02:18:56.120
it's when it's going to happen.

02:18:56.401 --> 02:18:57.761
Where is it exactly?

02:19:02.241 --> 02:19:06.001
I see the earth rising, a second time,

02:19:06.281 --> 02:19:09.521
out of the foam, fair and green,

02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:11.681
down from the fells,

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:13.361
fish to capture,

02:19:13.641 --> 02:19:15.361
wings to eagle,

02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:17.441
water to flow.

02:19:17.721 --> 02:19:18.800
There's something

02:19:19.081 --> 02:19:19.800
about the island

02:19:20.081 --> 02:19:22.321
that's absent in everything

02:19:22.601 --> 02:19:24.040
we've done with Killing Joke,

02:19:24.321 --> 02:19:25.721
in the same way

02:19:26.001 --> 02:19:27.721
we've never done a single love song

02:19:28.001 --> 02:19:29.800
in Killing Joke.

02:19:30.081 --> 02:19:32.001
Cythera

02:19:32.281 --> 02:19:33.761
almost gives it away,

02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:35.401
well people just see you as

02:19:35.681 --> 02:19:37.800
stark, raving mad,

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:41.481
and then they're forced to accept

02:19:41.761 --> 02:19:43.521
what you dreamt

02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:45.241
was a reality;

02:19:46.001 --> 02:19:47.561
this is a victory.

02:20:03.121 --> 02:20:05.241
2012, MrJaz Coleman

02:20:05.521 --> 02:20:07.241
who leads all things Killing Joke.

02:20:07.521 --> 02:20:08.681
I don't think it's the end of the world

02:20:08.961 --> 02:20:10.481
I've got to be clear about this,

02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:12.481
we're told by all the indigenous cultures

02:20:12.761 --> 02:20:14.961
that there's going to be a huge upheaval.

02:20:15.241 --> 02:20:18.041
Economically none of our cash is redeemed by gold,

02:20:18.321 --> 02:20:19.161
it doesn't add up,

02:20:19.441 --> 02:20:21.041
people are in debt,

02:20:21.321 --> 02:20:22.161
and they're tired,

02:20:22.441 --> 02:20:23.521
and they don't know how to feed their families,

02:20:23.801 --> 02:20:25.681
we cannot trust the food in the supermarkets,

02:20:25.961 --> 02:20:27.241
two thirds of the world on

02:20:27.521 --> 02:20:29.241
one dollar a day and less,

02:20:29.521 --> 02:20:31.241
and this is increasing,

02:20:31.521 --> 02:20:32.361
we can see that the West

02:20:32.641 --> 02:20:35.201
has lost all moral authority;

02:20:35.481 --> 02:20:37.201
if there's going to be any legacy of Killing Joke

02:20:37.481 --> 02:20:39.801
it's about self-educating.

02:20:43.521 --> 02:20:45.801
Every artist is an initiate

02:20:46.081 --> 02:20:48.081
who knows the point of exchange

02:20:48.361 --> 02:20:50.641
between the spiritual world and the material world...

02:20:51.081 --> 02:20:52.801
<i>...as</i> you are familiar with the Kabbalah,

02:20:53.081 --> 02:20:55.001
like Tiphareth, the beauty who reigns

02:20:55.281 --> 02:20:59.641
at the centre of the Tree of Life;

02:21:00.521 --> 02:21:02.881
Jeremy Jaz Coleman

02:21:03.161 --> 02:21:05.321
I knight you with the

02:21:05.601 --> 02:21:08.201
National Order of Arts and Letters.

02:21:15.401 --> 02:21:17.801
The higher you go to the forces of light,

02:21:18.081 --> 02:21:19.241
the lower you must plunge

02:21:19.521 --> 02:21:21.521
to the forces of darkness simultaneously.

02:21:21.801 --> 02:21:24.521
The darkness that others have perceived,

02:21:24.801 --> 02:21:27.721
is simply the individuated personality,

02:21:28.001 --> 02:21:29.881
which others suppress,

02:21:30.161 --> 02:21:32.081
but we do not.

02:21:36.161 --> 02:21:39.841
We consciously release our dark sides

02:21:41.161 --> 02:21:42.401
within

02:21:43.361 --> 02:21:44.801
the music.

02:21:47.841 --> 02:21:49.481
Christ, you're in your fucking 50's,

02:21:49.761 --> 02:21:50.921
you get your band back together,

02:21:51.201 --> 02:21:52.921
there's still people interested...

02:21:53.201 --> 02:21:54.121
Raven aside, you know,

02:21:54.401 --> 02:21:56.161
we've survived,

02:21:56.441 --> 02:21:58.441
and that in itself is success...

02:21:58.721 --> 02:22:00.761
Can we not

02:22:01.041 --> 02:22:03.721
abuse the fucking privilege?

02:22:04.681 --> 02:22:06.361
It's a fucking gift from the gods,

02:22:06.681 --> 02:22:07.161
it is,

02:22:07.441 --> 02:22:08.881
that's the only way I can look at it.

02:22:12.721 --> 02:22:15.081
Killing Joke is my life,

02:22:15.361 --> 02:22:16.201
my world,

02:22:16.481 --> 02:22:17.001
everything.

02:22:17.281 --> 02:22:18.281
I saw them in the 80's,

02:22:18.561 --> 02:22:19.681
brought up with them in the 80's,

02:22:19.961 --> 02:22:21.841
and I brought my children tonight to see them,

02:22:22.121 --> 02:22:23.361
and I think I've converted them.

02:22:23.641 --> 02:22:25.801
If you cut my soul in half,

02:22:26.081 --> 02:22:27.041
and you went like that,

02:22:27.321 --> 02:22:29.001
it would sound like Killing Joke.

02:22:31.201 --> 02:22:33.361
Give us inspiration,

02:22:33.641 --> 02:22:35.801
give us strength, give us courage.

02:22:36.081 --> 02:22:37.441
Big Paul once said,

02:22:37.721 --> 02:22:39.521
it's the sound of the Earth vomiting,

02:22:39.801 --> 02:22:41.441
and it kind of is,

02:22:41.721 --> 02:22:43.441
and more than that, because,

02:22:43.721 --> 02:22:45.921
this was born in a very conscious way

02:22:46.201 --> 02:22:48.521
into being something more than entertainment.

02:22:48.801 --> 02:22:50.561
This is why the band

02:22:50.841 --> 02:22:52.441
<i>Stay. .-...</i>

02:22:52.721 --> 02:22:54.361
absolutely true to everything

02:22:54.641 --> 02:22:55.641
they ever were because

02:22:55.921 --> 02:22:58.001
they were born in ritual.

02:22:59.921 --> 02:23:01.641
In the beginning of Killing Joke,

02:23:01.961 --> 02:23:04.001
Killing Joke represented

02:23:04.281 --> 02:23:05.321
the feeling of

02:23:05.601 --> 02:23:07.041
having no control

02:23:07.321 --> 02:23:09.121
over your destiny,

02:23:09.401 --> 02:23:10.441
but over the years

02:23:10.721 --> 02:23:11.921
Killing Joke became

02:23:12.201 --> 02:23:13.921
the laughter, of knowing,

02:23:14.201 --> 02:23:14.521
that one has total control

02:23:14.881 --> 02:23:16.801
over one's destiny.
that one has total control

02:23:17.081 --> 02:23:18.681
over one's destiny.
