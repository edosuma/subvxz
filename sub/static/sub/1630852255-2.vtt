00:06.965 --> 00:11.344
- Brady!

00:13.304 --> 00:17.350
- Yeah, ride me, cowboy!

00:33.825 --> 00:37.328
Jesus...
Can you hear them?

00:38.705 --> 00:40.957
Eh, not that much.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.376
You're lucky.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.343
Steve, the phone!

00:53.136 --> 00:55.346
Who's callin'
on the landline?

00:58.349 --> 01:01.352
Hello... yeah.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.315
- It's Carrie.
- Hello?

01:15.742 --> 01:16.868
Oh...

01:25.710 --> 01:27.337
What do I do now?

01:29.214 --> 01:31.716
I guess...

01:31.800 --> 01:33.635
They take him away,

01:33.718 --> 01:36.346
- and--
- No, I meant me.

01:38.014 --> 01:42.352
- What do I do now?
- Oh honey, oh honey.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.386
You okay?

02:16.469 --> 02:17.637
Oh.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.306
It's my back.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.644
Sometimes Big has to rub it.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.650
Here?

02:32.944 --> 02:34.320
Thanks.
That's enough.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.657
You sure?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.319
<i>When you've come to the end
of the road together...</i>

03:15.278 --> 03:17.322
<i>and it's time to say goodbye...</i>

03:18.489 --> 03:20.158
<i>we can be there for you.</i>

03:21.701 --> 03:25.246
<i>When you feel
overwhelmed and lost,</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:27.248
<i>and don't know
which way to turn...</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:27.832
- Hey.
<i>-...we can be
there for you.</i>

03:27.916 --> 03:30.209
- Get any sleep?
- Mm-hmm.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.546
<i>We can help turn these
difficult decisions...</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:35.131
<i>into meaningful memories.</i>

03:36.925 --> 03:38.635
<i>You don't have to walk
this road alone.</i>

03:38.718 --> 03:41.471
- What is that?
- It's a funeral home
sizzle reel.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.183
Okay.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.438
Well, um, I'm gonna
make us some coffee,

03:50.521 --> 03:52.899
and then, we'll figure out
what we need to do here.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.652
No, you need to go home
and get some sleep
before school.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.946
Charlotte can come over
and help me figure this out.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.281
I'm not gonna go to school
and leave you alone here.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.076
- Where do you keep your coffee?
I won't be alone.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.619
Charlotte will be here,

04:04.702 --> 04:08.289
and you have to go to school,
especially after that first day.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.166
Well, we can talk
about that over coffee.

04:10.249 --> 04:12.293
- Where's your coffee?
- It's in the freezer.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.505
Okay...
I'm gonna make us some.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.007
Some what?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.471
Coffee.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.597
Mmm.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.323
- We got so lucky.
- So, so, so lucky.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.618
And I'm sorry
about last night.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.955
- Let's not pick
at each other anymore.
- We won't.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.541
It's stupid and petty
and not important.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.375
Y-You're all that's
important to me--

04:52.458 --> 04:54.627
And you're what's
important to me.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.256
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.261
All right.
Let me get some coffee.

05:05.179 --> 05:09.183
Are you wearing
that cologne I hate?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.477
Sorry. I heard myself. I did.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.023
I mean...

05:16.524 --> 05:19.277
And this is the Hampton space.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.531
Elegant, serene,
understated.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.576
It is the largest of
our five event spaces.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.203
How many participants
will you be expecting,
Mrs. Preston?

05:32.123 --> 05:37.211
Oh, um...
I, I hadn't even
considered that yet.

05:37.295 --> 05:41.257
It's, it's fine.
This just happened,
and...

05:41.340 --> 05:43.468
we just haven't
had time to collect
our thoughts.

05:43.551 --> 05:48.222
You're our first stop,
and it's, it's new to us.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.725
Understood.
Have a seat.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.352
Uh, Jane Hayes,
our primary mortician,

05:53.436 --> 05:55.021
will be in
to continue on.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.272
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.875
- What?
- He would hate it here.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.252
We can look
at the other rooms.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.463
No, the whole place.
It's just...

06:21.297 --> 06:23.674
It's just--
It's all wrong.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.845
This place is about
old people and death.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.519
The Hampton space...

06:35.686 --> 06:41.984
- Gotta love the irony.
- Carrie, I'm so, so sorry.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.153
If I hadn't forced you
to go to the concert

06:44.237 --> 06:46.280
then you would've gone
to the Hamptons with Big,

06:46.364 --> 06:48.407
and he would be
alive right now.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.326
I just--

06:50.409 --> 06:53.162
I feel like you
think it's all my fault.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.833
What?
I don't think that.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.794
Well, I do.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.130
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.299
Charlotte, he had
a heart attack.

07:05.383 --> 07:06.342
I know, I know,
but if you hadn't

07:06.425 --> 07:09.137
been at the concert,
you would've been with him,

07:09.220 --> 07:10.763
and you would've,
you would've done something,

07:10.847 --> 07:12.723
and then he would be alive now.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.983
- I'm Jane Hayes.
- Oh.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.862
I am so sorry for
your loss Mrs. Preston.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.614
I-I'm not Mrs. Preston.
She's Mrs. Preston.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.284
I-I'm just her friend.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.202
My apologies.
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.329
Thank you very much
for your time,

07:35.413 --> 07:37.915
but I don't think this
is gonna work out here.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.625
- Charlotte, let's go.
I'm very sorry.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.253
I walked in,
and she was
just so bereft.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.506
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.466
Charlotte, up.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.719
Would you rather
another mortician
of ours handle this?

07:49.802 --> 07:52.638
No, thank you.
Charlotte, please get
it together and get up.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.973
Yes.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.894
Please!

07:57.977 --> 08:01.647
Don't leave because
of a thoughtless
mistake I made.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.399
Jane, it's not you...
It's me.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.615
Shit.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.203
This is terrible.
I feel awful.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.204
I should be putting
you in an Uber.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.207
No, it's fine.
Go home and lie down.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.708
No, but just for an hour.
There's so much to do.

08:20.791 --> 08:24.587
- Are you sure you're
okay by yourself?
- I think I'd prefer it.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.092
Call Miranda.
Oh wait! No, no.
I can do that.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.427
I'm doing it now!

08:33.429 --> 08:33.471
Love you.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.852
Oh, sorry... Sorry.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.854
I, I just need
to find my ID.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.481
It's in here somewhere.
It'll just be a second.

09:25.564 --> 09:26.857
Sorry, sorry.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.567
Please step
to the side
until you do.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.902
No, no.
It's, it's right here.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.487
- I'm just--
- Uh, hello.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.196
This is Professor
Nya Wallace.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.657
She teaches law here.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.200
- You can let her through.
- Not without an ID I can't.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.953
I, I can
vouch for her.

09:39.036 --> 09:39.954
Uh, here.
I-I'm Miranda Hobbes.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.998
I'm in her class.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.791
Yeah, well,
you ain't her.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.793
Miranda, it's okay.
It's in here somewhere.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.295
Just one more place.
If not, I'll step out.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.505
- I'm sorry.
- I, I don't understand

09:49.588 --> 09:51.340
why you'requestioning her identity.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.759
I'm not questioning
her identity.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.386
I'm waitin' for her
to show me her ID.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.929
Well, it's interesting

09:57.013 --> 09:59.932
because you barely glanced
at mine when I went through.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.892
- Could I have your name?
- No.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.728
- Here it is, here it is.
- Thank you.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.397
Come on through,
Professor Wallace.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.571
- Hi. I just had
to say something.
- Did you?

10:13.654 --> 10:16.490
- Excuse me?
- Did you have
to say something?

10:16.574 --> 10:21.329
Oh... one of the important
takeaways I got from

10:21.412 --> 10:23.998
how to be an anti-racist
is if you see something

10:24.081 --> 10:26.834
you have to speak on it.
You have to call it out.

10:26.917 --> 10:30.171
Well, that's very noble
of you, even if a tad bit
white savior complex,

10:30.254 --> 10:33.674
but the reality is you
just inflamed a situation
that was perfectly fine.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.345
He needed to see my ID.
It was somewhere in my bag.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.889
This isn't
"To Kill a Mockingbird."

10:39.972 --> 10:41.599
I don't need
a good-hearted lawyer
to defend me.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.394
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.438
but it's not necessary
to apologize.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.857
We're all just here
learning, right?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.692
Speakin' of which,
what is happenin'
with all these books?

10:51.776 --> 10:54.028
It's all available online.
A Kindle weighs nothing.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.197
I, I know, but I just,

10:56.280 --> 10:59.200
actually, like to turn
the pages when I'm reading.

10:59.283 --> 11:02.453
- You're old-school.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.626
Why does everyone
wear black?

11:09.460 --> 11:12.296
Well, it's a tradition,

11:12.380 --> 11:16.550
and it just shows
that we're not happy
and feeling colorful.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.845
Yeah, I'm not feeling
that happy either.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.640
Oh, honey, come here.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.433
I need both my girls.

11:26.268 --> 11:28.437
We're all sad.

11:29.563 --> 11:33.067
Death...
it's a part of life.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.945
It's the saddest part,
but...

11:36.028 --> 11:38.656
it's, it's also
a really important part...

11:39.490 --> 11:42.410
because...

11:44.620 --> 11:48.416
it gives us
a chance to remember...

11:49.542 --> 11:52.420
how much
our loved ones
mean to us.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.424
So, while it's sad...

11:57.800 --> 11:58.968
it still can
be beautiful.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.637
Right? Right?

12:03.722 --> 12:06.016
Is Aunt Carrie all alone now?

12:06.100 --> 12:08.477
No, she has us.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.478
Lisa Todd Wexley is here.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.064
She said she's
invited for lunch.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.608
Oh my gosh, I forgot.
I love you guys.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.490
How we doin',
Team Goldenblatt?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.410
Charlotte, honey,
don't worry about me.
I totally understand.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.745
- It just completely
flew out of my head.
- Yeah.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.748
I mean, this whole
thing has just been
a horrible shock.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.126
I'm just a mess.
I could barely
keep it together

12:32.209 --> 12:34.795
- in front of the girls just now.
- I was the exact same way

12:34.879 --> 12:35.921
when I lost
my dad last year.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.300
I could see my rings
literally shaking on my hands

12:39.383 --> 12:41.427
while I was trying
to be so strong for them.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.430
- It's hard.
- It's so hard.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.681
Oh, honey.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.727
Oh, it's all right.
Oh, okay.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.649
What was he even
doin' on that bike?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.651
It wasn't
the bike, Steve.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.280
He was on that bike for
over a thousand rides.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.324
Still.
It doesn't seem smart.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.367
He, he had
a heart condition.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.369
He got the okay
from his cardiologist.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.122
Exercise is good
for the heart.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.957
Apparently not.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.460
The bike was a mistake.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.337
Why do you think you
keep tryin' to make
this about the bike?

13:16.420 --> 13:20.174
I don't know.
I--

13:20.257 --> 13:20.799
To make sense of it,
I guess. I...

13:27.097 --> 13:28.390
I can't believe he's gone.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.937
Man... that sucks.

13:33.646 --> 13:33.812
Agreed.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.775
Death sucks.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.868
Hey...
Come here.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.953
I'm good.

13:49.036 --> 13:49.745
Well, we are not.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.666
Come.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.334
Hug your ma and me.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.392
You took the SD card,
and the sound quality is okay?

14:13.310 --> 14:16.146
Okay. I'll see you
in about 45 minutes.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.316
No, I know.
I just wanna get there
before other people,

14:19.400 --> 14:21.402
and make sure everything's
the way I want it.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.405
Okay. Bye.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.802
What a chic place
for a funeral.

14:46.885 --> 14:49.597
Trust me, it's the only
chic place for a funeral.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.057
Thank god for these lesbians.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.145
Oh my god.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.607
There it is.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.611
Are you okay?

15:05.362 --> 15:05.779
I said no flowers.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.159
I'll be right back.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.537
I'm so proud
of her.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.373
With all she's
going through,

15:16.457 --> 15:19.835
pulling it together,
and giving us
a look today

15:19.918 --> 15:22.421
because people
will be expecting it.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.174
She's kind of
our Jackie Kennedy.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.052
Mm-hm, maybe don't
say that to her.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.386
Oh, I did already.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.805
Mm-hm.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.391
Hi. I need to speak
with Lila and Carmen.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.478
Oh.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.649
The flowers came
right after we hung up.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.484
We wanted you
to at least see them,

15:43.567 --> 15:45.486
so you could make
an informed decision.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.822
Now, we're totally onboard
with your vision, but...

15:48.906 --> 15:51.033
that vignette is
just so gorgeous.

15:53.744 --> 15:53.911
I don't know.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.331
Well, who's
it even from?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.635
They can stay.

16:19.978 --> 16:24.650
Carrie, everything
is just beautiful.

16:24.733 --> 16:28.195
The funeral director
asked me if I wanted
to rent a coffin,

16:28.278 --> 16:31.365
- you know, since
he's being cremated.
- Right.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.076
Big would never
want to be in a rental.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.036
He wouldn't
even rent a car.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.830
Did they pressure
you to buy all that

16:37.913 --> 16:40.249
collision insurance
with those, too?

16:43.127 --> 16:46.338
I was tryin'
to be funny,
and I wasn't.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.008
- Well, everything's
just perfect.
- Oh good.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.887
I wanted it to be.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.473
And you changed
your mind about
the flowers.

16:57.891 --> 16:58.934
No, they're
from Samantha.

17:03.731 --> 17:07.151
Oh, there's Gloria.
Big's secretary.

17:07.234 --> 17:11.363
- That's what she
prefers to be called.
- Okay. Go, go.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.326
Good.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.329
It-it feels good,
right?

17:20.664 --> 17:22.332
It means a lot.

17:25.169 --> 17:25.961
Yeah.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.342
- How you doin', my love?
- Okay.

17:37.848 --> 17:41.351
- Gloria.
- Oh, Carrie.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.730
Carrie... how do
you feel about hugs?

17:44.813 --> 17:47.441
From you?
Pretty darn good.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.781
I always ask because I hate
to be pawed by strangers.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.158
Well, you're
not a stranger.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.451
Oh, that's so sweet
of you to say.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.953
But it's true.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.246
He always said,

18:01.330 --> 18:03.123
"Gloria knows
more about me

18:03.207 --> 18:03.874
than I know
about myself."

18:03.957 --> 18:07.461
Oh wow.
He was one of a kind.

18:07.544 --> 18:08.962
He kept me on for years

18:09.046 --> 18:12.216
when all the others got
rid of their old gals.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.051
Bastards.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.136
I mean the men,
not the old gals.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.557
- Wow, that's quite a dress.
- Thank you.

18:20.641 --> 18:24.853
- I wanted to do him proud.
- Ha, mission accomplished.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.856
Oh, go. You have all
these people to see.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.943
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.820
I'm sorry
for our loss.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.531
Go.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.074
- Aw, thank you
for coming.
- Of course.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.703
- Che, you didn't have to come.
- Of course, I did.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.081
It's someone you loved.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.874
- That means a lot to me.
- Of course.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.502
And if any trouble
breaks out,

18:48.585 --> 18:49.503
place gets a little rowdy,

18:49.586 --> 18:51.380
you know how these
discreet funerals can be,

18:51.463 --> 18:52.339
I got you.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.092
I used to be a bouncer
at a dyke bike club,

18:55.175 --> 18:57.261
so that's some
world-class bouncin'.

18:58.637 --> 19:02.015
- Thanks for the laugh.
- Mm, technically, only a smile.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.141
I'm a stand-up.
I notice these things.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.727
Thank you.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.445
Oh, excuse me, um,
you're in my seat.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.488
It's assigned
seating in front.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.532
Oh.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.035
I see.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.247
Yeah, that, that's me,
uh, right next to Carrie.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.333
- I beg your pardon.
- Here, you can
have my seat.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.167
- I'll find a place
in the back.
- Oh.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.546
No, no, it's fine.
Thanks so much.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.715
I see plenty of chairs
with names on them.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.467
- I'm sure you're there.
- I'm sure I am.

19:39.094 --> 19:39.136
Hm.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.225
What?
I'm sorry.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.102
I need to be at the side
of my best friend

19:47.185 --> 19:48.562
during her husband's funeral,

19:48.645 --> 19:51.106
and I need my husband
at my side on the other side.

19:51.189 --> 19:55.277
Hi.
Can I have a glass
of Chablis, please?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.071
Oh, we're serving
after the service.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.490
Oh, that's okay.
I'm family.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.952
My husband sent over all
the liquor from his bar.

20:06.663 --> 20:07.915
You know what?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.249
Looking around,
I'm not sure

20:09.333 --> 20:11.418
we have enough wine
for everyone,

20:11.501 --> 20:12.753
so, maybe, save that,

20:12.836 --> 20:15.881
and I will have
a neat bourbon.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.507
Super quick.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.056
I'm speaking,
and it's about
to start,

20:24.139 --> 20:26.308
so if you could,
super quick. Thank you.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.353
Thank you.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.115
Oh, Miranda's
speaking.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.118
I would've liked to
have said a few words.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.038
It's a funeral,
not "The Moth."

21:17.150 --> 21:18.318
How lucky...

21:20.278 --> 21:22.572
How lucky
we all are...

21:22.656 --> 21:24.574
to have known
this amazing man,

21:25.784 --> 21:27.828
John James Preston.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.498
How lovely...

21:31.581 --> 21:32.207
to have shared dinners...

21:33.750 --> 21:35.836
drinks, deals...

21:35.919 --> 21:38.213
and, for some of us, cigars

21:40.424 --> 21:42.259
with this one-of-a-kind.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.347
How long...

21:47.431 --> 21:49.808
it seems that we
have known him...

21:50.934 --> 21:52.269
How very long.

21:54.312 --> 21:57.274
And yet, not near long enough.

22:00.360 --> 22:00.402
How large...

22:02.362 --> 22:03.947
he was...

22:04.031 --> 22:05.490
in all of our lives.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.703
He will leave a big...

22:10.454 --> 22:11.496
hole.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.459
And how sad...

22:17.586 --> 22:19.254
how very, very sad.

22:21.715 --> 22:25.260
But for today,
let us remember...

22:27.846 --> 22:29.264
how lucky.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.279
That was beautiful.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.655
Carrie wrote it.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.618
Good afternoon.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.746
I've been asked to say
a few words about, um...

22:53.246 --> 22:55.082
my baby brother.

22:58.335 --> 23:02.422
When I spoke with John
just last week...

23:02.506 --> 23:05.842
he told me that he
had never been happier
in his whole life.

23:08.136 --> 23:10.722
And, well,
I'd say that's...

23:10.806 --> 23:11.348
the way to go out.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.268
So, Carrie...

23:15.852 --> 23:17.521
I thank you...

23:18.855 --> 23:20.273
for giving him that.

Ooh, Charlotte, can
you walk Gloria out,

25:06.379 --> 25:09.049
and just make sure
she gets in a cab?

25:09.132 --> 25:10.550
- Of course.
- Oh, that's not necessary.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.678
Well, I know it's not,
but I'll feel better.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.223
- I'll call you soon, okay?
- Well, when you're up to it.

25:16.306 --> 25:19.142
There's a slew
of papers that we've
gotta get through.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.853
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.650
Carrie,
I know, I know.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.860
I lost my Bobby
a year and a half ago,

25:28.944 --> 25:30.862
so I know.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.656
People said they knew
how I was feeling.

25:32.739 --> 25:36.159
They didn't know,
but I know.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.661
It's still so fresh.

25:37.744 --> 25:40.622
It's wonderful that
you get to see
family and friends,

25:40.705 --> 25:43.667
and, and make something
beautiful like this.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.710
I lost Bobby so early
in the COVID,

25:45.794 --> 25:47.587
you couldn't
see anyone.

25:47.671 --> 25:50.465
No one even knew how
to Zoom Shiva yet.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.133
- Yeah.
- And if anyone
would've loved

25:52.217 --> 25:55.428
a big send-off
like this,

25:55.512 --> 25:58.265
it would've been
my husband...

25:58.348 --> 25:59.391
Mr. Broadway.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.560
- Oh, oh, do you know
Kevin Silberton?
- No.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.104
- Bobby's pianist.
- No, oh.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.773
- His orchestrator.
- H-How is that relevant

26:06.856 --> 26:08.775
- today and here?
Sorry for your loss.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.278
Thank you.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.570
He doesn't know...

26:14.531 --> 26:16.074
I know.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.161
- Carrie.
- Susan Sharon.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.914
I didn't know
you were here.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.374
Oh, it's so nice
of you to come.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.251
Carrie...
look at me.

26:26.334 --> 26:30.463
I forgive you.
It's over.
In the past.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.923
When I read the obit
in the "Times,"

26:32.007 --> 26:33.967
I said to myself,
"Susan Sharon,

26:34.050 --> 26:36.511
life is too short
to hold a grudge."

26:37.554 --> 26:39.139
Do you--
You remember Miranda?

26:39.222 --> 26:40.682
Sure.
All of that's water

26:40.765 --> 26:42.142
under the bridge,
I guess.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.226
So, I said to myself,

26:43.310 --> 26:45.228
"Susan Sharon,
let it go.

26:45.312 --> 26:48.273
"Just fuckin'
let it go,

26:48.356 --> 26:51.151
"and go to Carrie,
and make things
right with her

26:51.234 --> 26:53.945
- whether she wants to or not."
- No--

26:54.029 --> 26:56.740
I mean,
I know you have a lot
on your plate right now,

26:56.823 --> 26:59.492
and I'm not expecting
an apology or a <i>mea culpa,</i>

26:59.576 --> 27:01.328
so just consider this your
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

27:01.411 --> 27:07.042
I love you.
I'm back. The end.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.502
And we can work
this all out when
you have the bandwidth.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.588
It was nice
to see you again.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.423
Yes.

27:20.263 --> 27:21.890
What happened
between you two?

27:21.973 --> 27:24.601
I have no idea.
I was hoping you knew.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.895
- I mean... Hey.
- Hey.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.773
- How you holdin' up, huh?
- Oh, I'm fine, fine.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.441
Do you need anything?

27:35.987 --> 27:38.031
That Carrie.
She's totally amazing.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.868
Runnin' around,
she's producin' this
whole thing, you know...

27:41.951 --> 27:46.414
If it were you in that box,
I would be a total mess.

27:47.248 --> 27:50.377
- She's not even cryin'.
- Yeah...

27:50.460 --> 27:51.753
but is that a good thing?

27:51.836 --> 27:54.547
It must be cool
being like a real,
for-real comedian.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.135
- My buddy Sean makes
these funny videos,

27:59.219 --> 28:00.970
- but, you know,
he's not a pro.
- Wow.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.348
- Cool.
Brady!

28:07.477 --> 28:08.937
What do you think
you're doing?

28:09.020 --> 28:10.480
Down there.
I'm talking to you.

28:10.563 --> 28:12.732
- What do you think
you're doing?
Well, uh,

28:12.816 --> 28:14.067
I'm pickin' up the pipe

28:14.150 --> 28:15.068
that my man here
threw to the ground.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.695
He is not your man.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.865
He is my son,
and he is not a man.
He is a minor.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.242
I could have
you arrested.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.576
Okay, so I was
just standing here

28:23.660 --> 28:25.995
minding my own business,
not corrupting a minor,

28:26.079 --> 28:27.747
when he came over
and asked me for a hit.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.250
- He's 17!
- Stop, you're
embarrassing me.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.668
No, you have
embarrassed yourself.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.212
Who the fuck
are you anyway?

28:34.295 --> 28:35.422
Why are you even here?

28:35.505 --> 28:37.507
What're you?
Some kind of a, a

28:37.590 --> 28:39.551
funeral pot pusher?

28:39.634 --> 28:42.762
No, I'm not,
but that is a great idea
for an untapped market.

28:42.846 --> 28:46.141
- You think this is funny?
- Well, not yet, but...

28:46.224 --> 28:48.852
gimme an hour or two,
and I'll work it into
a solid tight ten.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.645
Mom, Mom.

28:51.729 --> 28:53.648
I don't know
who you are...

28:53.731 --> 28:54.774
or where you
came from,

28:54.858 --> 28:58.653
but, trust me,
you don't wanna
mess with me.

28:58.736 --> 29:01.781
And if you don't back
the fuck up from us
right fuckin' now,

29:01.865 --> 29:03.950
I'm gonna rip your
goddamn head off.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.244
Okay, just chill, all right?

29:06.327 --> 29:09.956
- Slow your roll.
- I have no intention
of slowing my anything.

29:10.039 --> 29:13.543
This is my son that
you are getting high
on God-knows-what.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.795
Mom!
It was just weed.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.714
I, I felt sad.
I needed a hit.

29:19.757 --> 29:22.844
- Oh, you felt sad.
- Yes!

29:22.927 --> 29:26.639
Maybe I should kill myself,
so you can try crack.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.350
- Oh my god.
- You're going home with
your father right now.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.812
And no Luisa for a week.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.440
Oh, okay, now you
sound really crazy.

29:39.360 --> 29:39.736
What did you say?

29:41.237 --> 29:42.447
I said, um...

29:43.490 --> 29:44.449
Where's Dad?

29:45.366 --> 29:46.659
I'm gonna go find him.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.918
Oh, Miranda, I want
you to meet someone.

29:55.001 --> 29:57.086
This is my
podcast boss,

29:57.170 --> 29:59.506
Che Diaz.
Che...

29:59.589 --> 30:03.176
this is my ride-or-die,
Miranda.

30:03.259 --> 30:05.845
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

30:05.929 --> 30:09.390
Oh, sorry. I have to--
Anyway, excuse me.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.393
Um...

30:14.354 --> 30:16.564
- All I can say is--
- If you actually think

30:16.648 --> 30:19.067
there are words that
are gonna make this
less uncomfortable...

30:19.150 --> 30:21.361
go for it.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.030
Okay...
I was, maybe,
a little too--

30:24.113 --> 30:25.532
No, don't.
You were fine.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.575
That, that was totally
on me out there.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.702
I didn't think
his age was
even a factor,

30:29.786 --> 30:32.539
probably 'cause
I've been smokin' weed
since I was 13.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.541
Why didn't you
tell me who you were?

30:34.624 --> 30:37.001
I just assumed that
the correct behavior
when you're...

30:37.085 --> 30:38.586
being accused of doing
inappropriate things

30:38.670 --> 30:39.796
with a boy is to
just walk away.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.882
But, um...

30:42.966 --> 30:45.176
honestly, it was
very cool how you
protected him out there.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.594
- Yeah.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.180
Well, thank you.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.557
I guess I'm kinda
like a mama bear

30:50.640 --> 30:53.726
- when it comes to my kid.
- Mama bear?

30:53.810 --> 30:55.520
- Honey, try papa bear.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.481
Okay, like a big daddy
silverback papa bear like,

30:58.565 --> 31:00.525
"Rawr!"

31:05.321 --> 31:06.656
Let's start again.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.576
I'm Che Diaz.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.953
- I'm Miranda Hobbes.
- Hi.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.497
Um, Che as
in Che Guevara?

31:14.581 --> 31:17.834
Ah,
Che as in the first
three letters of Cheryl.

31:17.917 --> 31:18.585
Yeah, I dropped
the "r-y-l."

31:18.668 --> 31:21.087
I mean, do I seem
like a Cheryl?

31:21.170 --> 31:23.423
- No.
- Yeah.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.382
And you don't seem
like a Miranda.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.259
- Oh?
- Yeah.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.636
What do I seem like?

31:29.512 --> 31:31.889
- A Rambo.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.766
- Yeah, like...
- Right, right.

31:48.281 --> 31:51.367
Well... at least
that's all behind me.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.886
I guess this is what
happens when you request
"No flowers, please."

32:09.969 --> 32:10.637
What part of "no flowers"

32:10.720 --> 32:13.389
do orchid people
not understand?

32:14.891 --> 32:16.643
I can take that lox
to the synagogue

32:16.726 --> 32:18.102
if it's still good
in the morning.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.313
- Yes, please do.

32:26.361 --> 32:30.531
<i>♪ Leave your cares behind ♪</i>

32:30.615 --> 32:33.326
<i>-♪ These are the good times ♪</i>
What the fuck?

33:19.455 --> 33:20.915
Oh, hi.

33:28.965 --> 33:32.802
Aaaah! No, no!
Get that devil doll
away from me!

33:39.308 --> 33:41.769
- Hey! Hey!
- That devil doll's tryin'
to steal her shit!

33:42.437 --> 33:44.397
Help!
Give me my bag!

33:45.148 --> 33:47.650
Ha!
Take that, devil doll.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.444
This shit's crazy.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.903
Oh my god.
I'm so sorry.

33:50.987 --> 33:51.612
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.989
I, I, I--
It was unclear to me

33:53.072 --> 33:55.783
whether that was
a white savior
moment or not.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.410
Well, I, uh...

33:57.493 --> 33:59.787
I think that was
a "any kind of savior
will do" moment.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.414
- What the fuck was that?
- I have no idea,

34:01.497 --> 34:06.252
but I'm telling you,
a Kindle would not have
had the same impact.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.923
- Old-school.
- Old-school.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.063
Good afternoon.
This was just
delivered for you.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.440
Oh, thanks, Joe.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.919
Shouldn't they have
called her first?

34:48.002 --> 34:49.629
- I would think.
Well, I was
pretty out of it that day.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.214
Maybe I checked
a box that said,

34:51.297 --> 34:55.092
"Please surprise me at home
with my dead husband's ashes."

34:58.221 --> 35:01.432
- Did I make these too strong?
- Not for this occasion.

35:02.558 --> 35:03.643
Hello?

35:04.602 --> 35:08.314
Oh... okay.

35:08.397 --> 35:09.899
Thank you, Joe.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.611
Charlotte's on her way up.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.613
Stanford, you have
to go and hide.

35:15.696 --> 35:16.864
- Excuse me?
- If she sees you two,

35:16.948 --> 35:19.534
she'll think
I didn't call her.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.827
Well, why would she think that?

35:20.910 --> 35:23.913
- Because I didn't call her.
- Is something wrong?

35:23.996 --> 35:27.041
You mean,
besides the fact that
Big is in that box?

35:28.584 --> 35:30.837
I didn't call her
because she tends to run
a little emotional,

35:30.920 --> 35:33.589
and this situation
is emotional enough,

35:33.673 --> 35:35.216
so, Stanny, can
ya please go hide?

35:35.299 --> 35:38.845
- Why can't Miranda hide?
- Because I'm not going to.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.805
Listen,
it's Miranda's turn
to sleep here.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.932
- You're the outlier.
- I have a feeling
I'm a bad hider.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.351
It won't be that long,
I promise.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.727
I'll tell her that
I'm not in the mood to talk.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.313
I'm depressed, which I am.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.570
- Hey.
- Miranda's here.
It's her night.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.404
Hi.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.656
Well, I just stopped by
on my way home

35:58.739 --> 36:01.158
because I went to the good
magazine place today,

36:01.242 --> 36:03.369
and I brought
you "British Vogue,"

36:03.452 --> 36:05.454
"Spanish Vogue,"
and "Italian"--

36:08.040 --> 36:08.708
Stanford?

36:08.791 --> 36:11.878
- Where?
- He just like...

36:11.961 --> 36:14.338
ran by in-into the bedroom.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.218
Come out, Stanny.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.679
Sorry, I went back
for my martini.

36:21.762 --> 36:23.723
I, I told you,
I'm not a good hider.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.311
Big's ashes came,
and she was upset.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.899
Okay... well...

36:34.025 --> 36:37.069
Here are your magazines.
Have a good night.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.073
Wait, Charlotte.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.702
I was very upset
when his ashes arrived,

36:44.785 --> 36:45.912
so I called Stanford.

36:45.995 --> 36:48.956
Please don't make
this about you.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.500
I'm trying really
hard not to...

36:52.668 --> 36:54.462
but it is
pretty obvious

36:54.545 --> 36:57.673
that you're mad at me
because I made you
go to the recital.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.968
There's no other
possible reason

37:01.052 --> 37:03.429
that you would call
Stanford over me.

37:03.512 --> 37:04.764
- Well--
- Just let it go.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.933
Okay, the truth is,
I didn't call you

37:07.016 --> 37:08.976
because you get
so emotional.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.896
It's because I cried
at the funeral home.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.483
-'Cause you're crying now.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just--

37:16.317 --> 37:20.279
- You seem so mad.
- I am mad.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.490
Mad at myself,
not you.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.159
I should've gone
to the Hamptons

37:25.242 --> 37:27.745
with Big
on Wednesday night.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.958
Like I wanted to!

37:33.250 --> 37:37.171
- Everything all right out here?
- Yeah, sorry, Phil.

37:38.089 --> 37:38.172
Okay.

37:49.016 --> 37:49.183
Go inside.

38:04.198 --> 38:04.365
Oh!

38:08.536 --> 38:10.997
Great... now
I'm that neighbor.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.584
You can't blame yourself,
Carrie. You can't.

38:15.668 --> 38:19.046
You didn't know
Big was gonna have
a heart attack that night.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.506
And neither did you.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.924
So, what's with
the white designer hoodie

38:22.008 --> 38:24.176
on the old coot neighbor?

38:28.097 --> 38:31.559
And that is why
I would call Stanford
instead of you.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.256
- You okay?
- I'm never gonna fall asleep.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.259
Can you give me
another pill?

39:11.140 --> 39:13.726
Not for another five hours.

39:13.809 --> 39:17.271
- Sorry.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.913
