<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:37.579 --> 00:40.207
This place is dead.

00:40.207 --> 00:44.007
Not cold enough for propane,
not hot enough for propane.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.800
Goldilocks season, honey.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.968
It'll pick up.

00:46.964 --> 00:50.468
Propane may be a gas,
but it's like a rock.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.514
Hey, Hank!

00:54.888 --> 00:57.437
This fat guy was dancing...

00:57.432 --> 00:58.775
then he slipped!

00:58.767 --> 01:01.737
If you think this is funny,
you should see "funny cats."

01:04.105 --> 01:05.197
Donna, turn it off.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.442
This is work.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.445
Sorry, Hank, but there's
nothing to do here.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.196
Have you done
your expense reports?

01:12.197 --> 01:14.746
Fine, I'll do
the expense reports.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.788
Hey, Hank,
isn't that Pat Ritchie

01:18.787 --> 01:20.255
coming out of Thatherton's?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.755
It is.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.720
Pat.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.802
Oh. Hank.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.722
I'm just, uh, you know,
buying some, uh, propane.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.727
From Thatherton.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.687
Yeah.

01:35.679 --> 01:36.726
I-I'm sorry.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.520
I-I met him on MySpace.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.438
W-what are you talking about?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.560
Your house?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.608
No, no, no, MySpace
is on the Internet.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.574
We-we chatted online,
and, well, we became friends.

01:46.565 --> 01:47.737
But we're friends.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.776
We've been in business
for a decade.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.450
Yeah, but on MySpace you get
to know someone real fast.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.789
And it turns out,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.578
Thatherton's as obsessed
with Weezer as I am.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.996
What's Weezer?

01:56.992 --> 01:58.494
Exactly.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.995
Bye, Hank.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.709
<i>Thatherton?!</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:07.754
Gotdang! I know Pat Ritchie
cheats on his wife,

02:07.919 --> 02:09.795
but I never thought
he'd cheat on me!

02:09.795 --> 02:12.265
Apparently, he communicated
with Pat

02:12.257 --> 02:14.476
on something called MySpace.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.594
MySpace?!

02:15.594 --> 02:17.392
He used MySpace?!

02:17.387 --> 02:19.481
What is MySpace?
What are we talking about here?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.350
I don't know, sir.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.772
I think it's a cult.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.692
Hmm-mm. It's a social
networking site,

02:25.687 --> 02:26.688
you know, on the Internet.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.074
It makes socializing fun.

02:29.066 --> 02:33.412
Well, we need to get Strickland
on the Internet then ASAP!

02:33.403 --> 02:36.873
But, sir, we already have
a sell sheet to inform people.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.537
Got to keep up with
the times, Ol' Top.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.339
Uh, Donna, can you
put us on MySpace?

02:44.331 --> 02:46.049
Yeah, I'd love to.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.793
It sure beats
the rest of the crap

02:47.793 --> 02:49.795
I normally have to do
around here.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.012
Donna...

02:54.800 --> 02:56.973
Pig?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.477
Yeah! All right!

03:00.472 --> 03:02.349
You got me a Pig!

03:02.349 --> 03:03.726
Bobby, get away from that thing.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.360
That is not our pig.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.694
Bobby, stay back!

03:09.856 --> 03:11.449
You'll damage the nose!

03:15.112 --> 03:17.160
Dale, why do you have a pig?

03:17.155 --> 03:20.159
Nancy and I had dinner
at That's Amore last night.

03:20.158 --> 03:24.288
Nancy got some truffle shaved
on her pasta, and it cost $30.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.540
It was a good thing
we got separate checks.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.339
Anyway, I decided to rent myself
a truffle-hunting pig,

03:29.334 --> 03:31.757
so I could have
as many truffles as I want.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.801
Pigs can hunt?

03:33.797 --> 03:36.801
Man, they keep getting
cooler and cooler!

03:36.800 --> 03:39.428
Count me in!

03:40.679 --> 03:42.727
Please, Dale, let me
get truffles with you.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.724
I love truffles.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.772
Okay, you can come with.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.737
But you do know these aren't
chocolate truffles, right?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.523
Of course I know that.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.777
I want the kind of truffles
that we're talking about.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.778
Have you guys heard
of this MySpace?

03:56.778 --> 03:57.745
Of course.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.781
It's the best part
of my life right now.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.374
I don't understand it.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.370
Why do you want to communicate
with strangers?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.087
Well, they may start out
as strangers,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.047
but then they become
your friends.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.791
Not the kind of friends
that you hang out with,

04:09.791 --> 04:11.793
but the kind that you type to
when you're drunk.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.919
Tell you what, man,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.547
easy datin' on that
dang ol' MySpace, man.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.891
Put up my dang ol' college photo
on there, man.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.351
Yes, Boomhauer.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.721
That's exactly why I like
to deal with people in person.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.769
That way, you know
what you're getting.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.065
Face-to-face interfacing
is obsolete.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.778
There's over 400 expressions
that you can make

04:30.771 --> 04:32.114
with symbols online.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.778
You can only make
two expressions

04:33.774 --> 04:34.741
with your face, Hank.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.198
Are you agreeing with me?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.367
Are you happy?
Are you sad?

04:39.362 --> 04:40.363
I can't tell.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.535
It's true.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.784
Conversation is better
on MySpace.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.161
I reveal things about myself

04:45.160 --> 04:47.754
that I could just
never tell you guys.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.712
Don't go to MySpace, Hank!

04:53.376 --> 04:54.798
Enrique!

04:54.795 --> 04:57.298
I'm Allen252 from MySpace.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.640
Came to get that grill.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.758
Hey!

04:59.758 --> 05:02.102
I saw that picture of you
in Cancun, man.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.471
Do you think I would like
scuba diving?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.144
Allen252!

05:06.139 --> 05:07.766
Man, get your butt over here.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.063
Huh.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.733
I guess this MySpace thing
is really working.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.072
We already have over 40 friends.

05:14.064 --> 05:18.194
And I know most of them,
so they're all really cool.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.280
What's Joe Jack doing there?

05:22.280 --> 05:23.532
Check it out.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.672
Joe Jack, huh? Who knew!

05:31.665 --> 05:32.757
Watch this one.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.709
Whoo!

05:34.709 --> 05:35.801
Dance with me!

05:35.794 --> 05:37.796
Come on! I'm so drunk!

05:39.798 --> 05:41.800
I was so drunk.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.017
Donna, this is terrible.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.103
This is no way
to represent Strickland.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.564
You think I'm just
a number cruncher

05:47.556 --> 05:49.524
and I can't do creative things.

05:49.516 --> 05:53.441
Take this site down immediately
before anyone else sees it.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.033
Donna, I was just
on the MySpace.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.776
It was so much fun!

05:59.776 --> 06:03.246
And nothing attracts customers
more than fun!

06:04.281 --> 06:07.125
Thank you, Mr. Strickland.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.791
But there's nothing on there
about the propane

06:09.786 --> 06:11.709
or the propane accessories.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.794
Donna, I want you on
MySpace duty full time.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.922
I'm making you assistant manager
of new media.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.344
But-but I'm
the assistant manager.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.808
Well, now we got two.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.523
Everyone,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.188
now that I'm
an assistant manager,

06:32.183 --> 06:34.777
we're gonna take this place
to a new level.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.396
First order of business:

06:36.396 --> 06:40.276
we need to add some new video
to the site, so...

06:40.275 --> 06:42.653
who wants to get kicked
in the ding-dong?

06:52.954 --> 06:55.707
I don't know why
Strickland is on MySpace.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.343
The whole thing
is like a contest to see

06:58.335 --> 07:00.713
who can make the biggest ass
of themselves.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.760
That's why it's so great.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.804
I-I also
love MySpace,

07:04.799 --> 07:06.847
but I would never
be on it as myself.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.642
Online, I am Ted Danson.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.187
People will
tell Ted Danson anything.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.150
Kahn is manic-
depressive.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.492
Morning, Donna.

07:22.484 --> 07:26.239
Hey, who should we assign
to make more coffee for us?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.239
I'm thinking Melinda.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.536
Slow down, Donna.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.785
You've only been
assistant manager for a day.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.503
You'll find that leadership...

07:33.495 --> 07:35.168
Hot dang, people!

07:35.163 --> 07:38.087
We got ourselves
over 500 friends!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.797
Welcome to Strickland.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.844
I'm Hank.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.137
I'm actually here to buy
propane from Joe Jack.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.180
Right here.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.769
Preferably one that you freaked.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.183
I'm on it.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.729
I'm pretty sure I gave this one
the business, honey.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.314
But just to be sure...

07:57.310 --> 07:58.402
Whoo-haw!

08:00.480 --> 08:02.403
Business is really picking up.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.776
But at what cost?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.448
There's no way that's your body.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.740
You cut and pasted your face.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.780
This woman has six-pack abs.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.781
Count these.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.703
Wow!

08:10.865 --> 08:12.412
Look at Melinda's stomach.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.002
It's amazing!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.462
Melinda, no!

08:15.453 --> 08:16.750
Pull down your shirt.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.295
This is a workplace,
so get back to work.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.419
Hank, I need a picture
for your profile.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.217
Am I handsome?

08:28.216 --> 08:30.765
Do hunters ask each other
that question?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.933
Time to go
a-trufflin'.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.769
Dang.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.357
I didn't know
pigs could run like that.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.727
It's a rental!
After her!

08:42.897 --> 08:46.117
This grill offers more than
enough heat to do the job.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.703
Hank, we need you
to set up your profile.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.572
Donna, I-I'm with a customer.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.075
There's a billion
potential customers online.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.122
I think you need to deal
with them first.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.418
Get bloggin'!

09:00.790 --> 09:01.791
Okay.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.792
Donna will help you.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.092
Okay, so you can help me?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.805
Of course I can.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.722
Log onto
www.MySpace.com/strickprop.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.512
You can post questions there.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.683
Thank you.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.695
"The new reverse thread on the
dual intake portable propane

09:25.690 --> 09:27.613
containers allows for..."
Blah.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.328
What is this?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.788
Here, look at my page.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.748
Maybe this will inspire you.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.164
Good Lord, Donna!

09:40.163 --> 09:42.165
Deep breaths, Ladybird.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.088
Deep breaths.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.462
Sure, Ladybird barks at me,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.805
but she'll let any old riffraff
in the backyard.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.801
Peggy, I'm borrowing your dog
to track down my pig.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.768
If you'd like to borrow Joseph
as collateral,

09:53.760 --> 09:54.977
I'm okay with that.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.518
When you bring her back,
just hose her down.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.733
Hose Joseph, too.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.690
<i>You told everyone</i>

10:02.685 --> 10:04.437
I'm a pro-pain
in the neck!

10:04.437 --> 10:06.565
You're a pro-pain
in my neck!

10:06.564 --> 10:08.407
You're one to talk, Enrique.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.743
Your posts have offended
everyone in this office.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.371
Oh, please, Roger, you're just
mad about those pictures.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.741
No, my wife's mad
about those pictures!

10:15.907 --> 10:17.784
I was 30 days sober!

10:17.784 --> 10:19.411
Everyone, stop fighting!

10:19.410 --> 10:20.502
Hank's right.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.997
Save it for your blogs.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.341
No, our customers don't
need to know about this.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.507
This is exactly what the
customers want to know about.

10:28.503 --> 10:32.474
Hank, you don't understand
how "the world works" anymore.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.388
You don't get my generation.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.727
We're the same age.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.764
You just can't deal with the
fact that I'm your equal now.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.765
And as an assistant manager,

10:40.765 --> 10:43.188
I'm gonna ask you
for the last time

10:43.184 --> 10:44.561
to blog.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.690
Fine, Donna, you want me
to blog what I'm thinking?

10:48.690 --> 10:50.317
I'll blog what I'm thinking.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.738
Good. Finally.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.780
Donna is an idiot.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.780
Post

10:55.780 --> 10:57.202
Thank you, Hank.

10:57.198 --> 11:01.704
I'm sure my 4,000 friends
will find that very interesting.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.622
Oh, that's supposed
to scare me, huh?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.795
Are your 4,000 friends going
to come out of the computer

11:06.791 --> 11:07.758
and get me?

11:12.338 --> 11:15.387
The people are not really
in the computer, Hank.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.511
That would be like Poltergeist.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.770
Ladybird'll find that pig.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.692
She can find anything.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.738
She has dug up every one
of my goldfish we buried.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.782
Ladybird is an amazing animal.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.779
We probably don't even
need that stupid pig.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.788
I bet Ladybird could
find the truffles.

11:40.783 --> 11:44.287
Ladybird finds the truffles
and we cut out the middleman,

11:44.287 --> 11:45.709
or in this case the middle pig.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.624
Bill, that's brilliant.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.625
Thanks, Dale.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.717
That means a lot.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.595
Now, we just need
to introduce Ladybird

11:52.587 --> 11:54.589
to the scent of truffles.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.763
This food looks amazing.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.435
You look amazing.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.774
Would you like some truffle
shaved on your pasta?

12:04.766 --> 12:05.733
Of course.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.736
This night is
about trying new things.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.196
Remember this smell.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.320
And while you're at it,
get a whiff of the wine.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.742
There's money in that, too.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.576
Morning, Hank.

12:23.576 --> 12:28.503
Donna, we should probably talk
about what happened yesterday.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.296
Oh, Hank, what's done is done.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.793
It's a new day.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.215
Let's just move on.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.760
Well, all right.

12:37.799 --> 12:41.849
Well, look at that.
It's almost 10:00 already.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.569
What is going on out there?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.658
It's called a flash mob.

12:55.650 --> 13:00.156
My 4,000 friends don't think
I'm an idiot.

13:03.658 --> 13:07.583
Hot dang, look at
all these people.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.001
We got enough propane
to supply all y'all.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.671
That must be Hank!

13:11.666 --> 13:12.667
Get him!

13:15.211 --> 13:16.758
Good Lord.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.146
I can't believe this happened.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.769
Donna, you're fired.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.066
What?
You can't fire me, Hank.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.735
This is your fault.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.698
I need supervision.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.780
It is in all of my reviews.

13:37.775 --> 13:38.776
Shut up, Donna.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.777
You're fired.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.654
Unbelievable.

13:41.654 --> 13:45.204
Well, you haven't seen
the last of me.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.417
You'll pay.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.209
You'll all pay!

13:59.964 --> 14:03.594
Well, the Strickland
MySpace page is gone.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.721
Now, if you want
to see Melinda drunk,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.973
you got to go to the
Chimney Sweep after 5:00.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.144
Thank you, Roger.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.643
Now we can finally
get back to work.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.020
What in the Sam Hill?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.523
Uh-oh, it's back.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.774
Rogen

14:17.774 --> 14:19.151
I thought you took this down.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.151
I did, Hank.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.949
Someone must have put it back.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.788
Strickland is no good!

14:24.781 --> 14:26.783
Do not buy from Strickland!

14:26.783 --> 14:29.252
Their propane is bad!

14:29.243 --> 14:30.460
Turn it off.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.547
Donna changed the password.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.758
She controls
the Strickland site now.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.677
Unplug it.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.387
That ain't going to stop it.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.474
Her powers are growing, honey.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.765
We got to get a hold of Donna
and talk some sense into her.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.183
She's not
in the company directory.

14:48.179 --> 14:51.774
Donna was supposed to update it,
but I don't think she did.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.689
What did Donna do around here?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.778
Buck, where did you
send her paychecks?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.522
I paid her in cash.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.399
It was... simpler.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.777
Well, someone's got to know
where she lives.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.744
I mean, she had
that contest...

15:03.736 --> 15:06.785
You know, the sleeping over.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.783
Oh, hell, I don't remember.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.784
I was trashed.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.127
Stoned, honey.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.792
Death to Strickland!

15:12.787 --> 15:15.711
Death to Strickland!

15:15.706 --> 15:17.800
Death to Strickland!

15:17.792 --> 15:19.715
Death to Strickland!

15:19.877 --> 15:22.426
Sure, Donna was a
little lazy at work,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.470
but she was never like this.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.843
Maybe Ted Danson can talk
some sense into her.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.141
He has a way with the ladies.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.022
Ted's in.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.110
I agree with you

15:37.103 --> 15:38.104
about Strickland, baby.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.823
They are the worst, toots.

15:43.901 --> 15:47.781
Hello, Hank, and good-bye.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.373
Mm, she's good.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.743
Well, if we can't reach her
through a new friend,

15:51.909 --> 15:53.786
maybe we can use an old one.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.459
Let's try...

15:55.455 --> 15:56.456
Pete E Pete.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.958
He looks normal.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.800
Oh, God.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.793
Okay.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.966
How about... this?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.464
No.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.807
Ugh.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.924
Baah!

16:06.924 --> 16:08.221
Ugh!

16:08.217 --> 16:10.219
Can this stuff
hurt our computer?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.766
All that's left are her blogs.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.309
Maybe if you read them,

16:13.306 --> 16:15.729
you can find something
that will help locate her.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.402
Dear God,
she's written every day

16:22.398 --> 16:24.196
for the last four years.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.786
No wonder she never got
any work done at Strickland.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.155
I'll make some coffee.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.792
<i>And he was a jerk</i>

16:32.783 --> 16:35.787
<i>for not letting me use the full
service pump for self-service.</i>

16:35.786 --> 16:38.790
<i>So I said,
"If you want to play that game,</i>

16:38.789 --> 16:40.791
<i>your eggs count as 12 items,</i>

16:40.791 --> 16:43.419
<i>so you're in the wrong line,
too, bitch."</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:46.138
<i>A grande is only
a little bigger than a tall.</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:49.725
<i>Dogs are cool,
but cats are the coolest.</i>

16:49.717 --> 16:50.764
Anything?

16:51.761 --> 16:52.762
No.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.982
There's absolutely
no information here.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.691
Why don't you come to bed, Hank?

16:57.683 --> 17:00.983
I'm gonna try to
get through another month.

17:00.978 --> 17:05.404
<i>This year I'll probably
start wearing tons of purple.</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:14.742
Wingo, she's found something.

17:14.909 --> 17:17.537
Back, Ladybird, back.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.005
I can't let the dog eat it.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.964
Bill, you finish the dig.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.673
But don't eat it.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.768
Is it?
A truffle!

17:31.759 --> 17:33.682
Hold on. Let me verify.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.938
Huh.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.352
Wait a minute.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.726
It's got blue
and purple splotches.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.941
And it smells iffy.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.235
I think it's a magic mushroom.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.325
No!

17:53.781 --> 17:54.953
What's happening to it?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.785
I think this pig is tripping.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.210
Hang in there, rental pig.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.379
Stay focused on me.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.797
You're with friends.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.763
This is a safe place.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.142
Anything?

18:14.135 --> 18:17.184
No, and I'm up to her last week.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.399
<i>And it's so weird that
what I want changes every day,</i>

18:20.391 --> 18:22.564
<i>like today
I think I want a baby,</i>

18:22.560 --> 18:25.564
<i>but I'm not going to tell David
that at our date on Friday.</i>

18:25.563 --> 18:26.735
<i>He's taking me
to Goobersmooches.</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:29.116
<i>OMG, fancy.</i>

18:29.108 --> 18:32.703
<i>Maybe I'll forget to take the
pill, winky smiley face, JK.</i>

18:32.695 --> 18:33.787
<i>I'm going to wear
a purple lace bra...</i>

18:33.779 --> 18:34.746
Wait a minute.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.282
I've got something.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.331
She's got a date at
Goobersmooches on Friday.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.125
That's today.
I know where it is.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.542
Follow me.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.088
Uh, we all know
where it is, Enrique.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.084
The date's tonight.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.802
We'll go after work.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.842
I-I wanted to go now.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.095
There she is, at the burger bar.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.603
I'm heading to the fruit salad

19:01.599 --> 19:04.193
to make this burger
Hawaiian-style.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.446
David, you're so funny.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.439
Donna.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.565
What the hell?

19:09.565 --> 19:13.570
What is this, Hank,
your pathetic flash mob?

19:13.569 --> 19:17.073
No, Donna, we're your coworkers
and we want to talk to you.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.791
So blog me.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.330
No, we're real people

19:20.326 --> 19:22.795
and we're here
to do this face to face.

19:22.787 --> 19:26.792
Oh, well, um, okay.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.091
Now, then, would you like to
tell me why you're so angry?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.639
I, um, just, uh...

19:34.799 --> 19:37.769
...felt like I wasn't taken
seriously at work.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.728
You never gave me
anything to do.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.606
You had plenty to do,
and you never did it.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.727
Because you only gave me
the boring stuff.

19:45.893 --> 19:46.940
But you're an accountant.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.688
What the hell you think
you were gonna do?

19:48.854 --> 19:49.696
I don't know.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.277
Design stuff?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.616
I'm creative.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.531
Well... maybe
you could have figured out

19:54.527 --> 19:56.370
some way to use that.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.490
Like, I know
where you can get oven mitts

19:58.489 --> 19:59.786
that look like puppets,

19:59.782 --> 20:02.706
and I have lots
of other ideas, too.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.620
Donna, we could have worked
everything out

20:04.620 --> 20:06.418
if we just talked about things

20:06.414 --> 20:09.293
instead of attacking
each other behind a computer.

20:11.669 --> 20:15.173
Strickland Propane is a family,
and like a family,

20:15.172 --> 20:18.267
we shouldn't know
each other's inner thoughts.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.762
That's what's so creepy
about MySpace.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.479
Donna, just come back
to work, huh,

20:22.471 --> 20:25.099
and take down
that mean ol' site.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.278
I'll see y'all Monday morning.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.487
Aloha.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.776
What's going on here?

20:31.772 --> 20:34.400
David, listen, I
was only dating you

20:34.400 --> 20:36.027
because I thought
I needed money,

20:36.026 --> 20:38.700
but I just got
my job back, so...

20:45.161 --> 20:46.538
I'm an alligator.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.335
I eat hot things
to protect hands.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.208
Hank, I'm just about done

20:51.208 --> 20:55.805
reconfiguring
the Strickland page.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.800
Hey, that's my sell sheet.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.473
But I don't know
if that needs to be flashing.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.642
Sure thing, boss.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.141
<i>Who wants to get
