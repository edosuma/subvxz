WEBVTT

00:50.925 --> 00:53.177
So, honey, this, uh...

00:53.344 --> 00:56.180
This threesome thing? Uh, heh.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.058
How are we even gonna find...?

00:59.309 --> 01:03.020
Actually, I'm making a list of women
I know who might be into this.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.733
Oh. Wow.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.652
Huh.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.822
Boy.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.285
Well, someone's been
doing their homework.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.330
Yeah. Oh, and I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice...

01:21.498 --> 01:22.956
...but she is so...

01:23.124 --> 01:25.375
Oh, I know. Ha, ha.

01:26.961 --> 01:30.964
You know, just talking about it
is getting me kind of...

01:31.132 --> 01:33.258
- I know. Me too.
- Yeah?

01:33.426 --> 01:34.885
I think Ben's asleep.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.721
Oh, um...

01:37.972 --> 01:42.768
You know, I think it'll be
better if we just save it.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.978
Yeah. Heh.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.273
Right. Save it. I can do that.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.326
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.577
How's it going?

02:00.829 --> 02:04.832
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here! Crazy!

02:04.999 --> 02:06.250
Here you go, sweetie.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.502
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.549
- I put some honey in it.
- Nyeh nyeh honey nyeh nyeh.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.972
- She doesn't know she was fired?
- No, the doctors say it may kill her.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.142
What are you two girls
whispering about over there?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.854
But I think we should tell her.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.444
Ugh, I mean, it's just so realistic.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.488
I know. Yeah.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.741
- His name's Pat.
- Pat the dog.

02:39.909 --> 02:43.370
Oh! Oh! I get it! Ha, ha!

02:43.538 --> 02:45.789
Oh, God.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.751
You, uh? You...

02:49.919 --> 02:53.297
...ready for a refill?
- Oh, I probably shouldn't.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.048
- Oh.
- So I will! Ha.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.303
Oh!

02:59.470 --> 03:00.971
Wow.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.557
- It's like it's raining.
- Pretty cool, huh?

03:03.725 --> 03:07.019
But if you think a fish wouldn't get
sucked into the mechanism...

03:07.187 --> 03:09.062
...well, you'd be wrong.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.900
Um, can I use your bathroom?

03:13.067 --> 03:17.237
- It's, uh, right through there.
- Okay. Ah.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.281
You know, I gotta tell you.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.366
If someone told me a week ago...

03:21.576 --> 03:25.078
...that I would be peeing
in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...

03:25.246 --> 03:27.748
Life's pretty great, isn't it?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.585
I hope you're hungry.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.837
We're starting with oysters.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.174
You know what they say about oysters,
don't you?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.468
They have parasites?

03:40.803 --> 03:42.054
No. Ha, ha.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.934
Um, well, some people say
that oysters are an aphrodisiac.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.728
- What people?
- People.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.647
People say it.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.316
Come here.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.447
- So, oysters, huh?
- Ha-ha-ha.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.408
And then we're gonna have a little
Middle Eastern couscous.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.993
Something we can eat...

04:05.161 --> 04:07.246
...with our hands.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.665
When we were studying
communicable diseases...

04:09.832 --> 04:11.917
No, no, no.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.293
It's sensual.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.171
- Oh. Didn't know. Okay.
- Okay.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.466
Oh, no!

04:19.968 --> 04:21.510
I'm sorry, it's the hospital.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.096
The food looks great.
Save me some?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.431
I can't promise anything.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.859
We're really gonna do this, huh?

04:39.862 --> 04:41.154
Looks like it.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.784
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out...

04:47.412 --> 04:49.413
- I got it!
- Okay.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.749
- Susan, hi.
- Hey.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.254
- Thank you so much for coming.
- I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.717
I'm Ross, by the way.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.719
Hello, Ross.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.640
- I love what you've done with this space.
- Thank you so much. Heh.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.313
How hot is this?

05:19.986 --> 05:22.154
I'm sorry you're here with me
instead of Roger.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.530
Yeah, me too.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.868
Well, I could make it seem
like he's here.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.496
"Here's some little-known facts
about couscous:

05:32.749 --> 05:36.376
They didn't add the second 'cous'
until 1979."

05:39.464 --> 05:42.466
- Stop it! That's not funny!
- Okay.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.384
I'm sorry, okay? It's just...

05:44.552 --> 05:48.055
...tonight was supposed to be,
you know, a big deal.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.058
- What was tonight?
- You don't want to know what tonight was.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.768
Okay.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.520
What was tonight?

05:58.524 --> 06:01.401
Tonight was going to be my first time.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.070
With Roger?

06:05.239 --> 06:08.367
Not just with Roger? Oh, my God.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.620
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!

06:14.248 --> 06:16.333
Four different women!

06:16.501 --> 06:18.835
I've had sex way more times.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.629
How many?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.631
Nine.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.135
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.889
Well, good. Good for you.
You really think Roger's the perfect guy?

06:31.057 --> 06:34.601
No, but he's not a horrible guy.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.853
That's what I tell girls about me.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.023
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

06:40.191 --> 06:42.901
No, you're not.
You are sweet and wonderful...

06:43.069 --> 06:44.903
...and this is gonna happen for you.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.823
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.366
Okay.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.871
I was kidding.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.915
So was I.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.506
Joey.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.467
You're such an amazing actor.

07:08.469 --> 07:12.431
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...

07:12.598 --> 07:15.100
...and Joey Tribbiani begins?

07:15.685 --> 07:18.645
Well, with Dr. Drake...

07:18.813 --> 07:21.606
...they always tell me what to say.

07:23.443 --> 07:28.113
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
make it up on my own.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.574
- Wow.
- Mm.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.868
Tell me something. Whoa!

07:35.580 --> 07:38.748
- I just fell right off the couch there.
- Yeah, you did.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.000
I'm okay.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.920
- Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
- Whoops. Yeah.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.631
When was the last time...

07:46.799 --> 07:49.509
...someone told you
just how beautiful you are?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.053
Wow.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.264
I can't feel my hands.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.559
Come on. Come here.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.106
- Huh?
- Huh.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.983
- Oh?
- Ooh.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.341
- We can't do this.
- No!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.135
- Oyster?
- Yeah.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.933
If... if! If we did do this,
there'd be a lot of pressure on me.

08:39.101 --> 08:43.522
Because you've waited a long time,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.565
But I have nothing to compare it to.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.401
So even if you were horrible,
how would I know?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.821
I do like that.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.200
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.702
Well, if it helps, there were only three.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.248
So it'd just be for tonight?

09:01.415 --> 09:04.793
Absolutely. It would just be one
friend helping out another friend.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.420
Stop it. We're not doing this.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.880
- Let's do it!
- No!

09:09.048 --> 09:11.091
- Okay!
- Okay!

09:12.260 --> 09:13.593
So, um...

09:13.761 --> 09:15.929
Do you have any, uh, moves?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.184
I have some moves.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.396
- I have no moves.
- Okay.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.191
Oh, okay, what you doing there?

09:28.985 --> 09:32.070
- I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
- Yeah, forget it.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.864
- What if I turn out the lights?
- Okay.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.538
Oh, yeah.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.083
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

09:46.210 --> 09:48.169
That's the couch.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.176
Oh, my God!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.096
I know!

09:59.015 --> 10:00.640
I'll tell you something.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.768
We are gonna do that again!

10:04.979 --> 10:07.397
- Oh, okay!
- Ah!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.992
Morning.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.954
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.624
Oh, God.

10:25.791 --> 10:30.629
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
heard me throw up.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.506
He actually saw you a little bit too.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.966
No.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.637
Oh, God, we... We didn't, uh?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.639
No. No, no.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.183
Not after seeing that.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.145
God, I'm just a horrible person.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.981
- Well, why?
- Because I'm married.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.025
That's right, I'm a married woman.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.612
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair. Ugh!

10:56.572 --> 10:58.406
That's ridiculous.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.451
I'm not a "star."

11:01.619 --> 11:05.121
I'm just a regular famous actor.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.334
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.170
Rachel, will you stop saying that?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.588
Hey. Hey, look.

11:13.756 --> 11:17.717
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?

11:17.885 --> 11:20.303
- And she gave me...
- The ring from the cave. Yeah.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.596
Wow.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.473
Uh, okay, well...

11:23.641 --> 11:25.183
Uh...

11:28.396 --> 11:31.189
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?

11:31.357 --> 11:35.485
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.570
And I want you to have it.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.489
- No, I couldn't.
- Yes. Yes.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.366
And every time you look at it...

11:41.534 --> 11:45.161
...I want you to remember
that you are a good person.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.539
Now, you had the chance to cheat...

11:47.707 --> 11:50.166
...and with me.

11:51.585 --> 11:55.714
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.801
But I thought that ring stood for
Capri's undying love for her brother.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.262
- Look, you want the ring or not?
- Yeah!

12:07.852 --> 12:09.769
Hey, look at you! You're up!

12:09.937 --> 12:12.272
- All right.
- I thought I'd try to take a walk.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.482
You pour me some water.
I'll be back soon.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.402
Whoa, whoa.
You're not gonna call work, are you?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.529
No. I've learned my lesson.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.327
Let's go. Come on. Move it.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.079
Phoebe, come on!

12:28.247 --> 12:31.958
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.341
Hey, Joe...

12:40.509 --> 12:42.427
...did you ever have a threesome?

12:46.056 --> 12:49.601
Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure
you're a very attractive man, but...

12:49.769 --> 12:51.060
No, I...

12:52.104 --> 12:54.773
No. The reason I'm asking is that...

12:57.485 --> 12:59.611
...I sort of had one last night.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.196
- You?
- Yeah.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.239
- Wow. All right.
- Yeah.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.366
So? Was it amazing?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.035
It was, heh...

13:07.203 --> 13:08.536
...okay.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.415
Just okay? Did you do it right?

13:13.334 --> 13:17.712
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:

13:17.880 --> 13:21.925
"Would anyone really miss me
if I weren't here?"

13:23.302 --> 13:25.136
Huh.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.555
But still, Ross.

13:27.723 --> 13:31.434
Your worst day with two women,
pretty much better than any other day.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.269
Oh, oh, no, absolutely.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.815
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.943
It's just...

13:40.402 --> 13:43.738
...my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly...

13:43.906 --> 13:46.449
...and then there was
a lot of waiting around.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.618
Oh.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.954
But you got to be with
both of them, right?

13:52.122 --> 13:53.915
Not really.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.210
Eh, just Carol.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.463
- Not the other one?
- No, she kept kicking me away.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.632
- You don't want that.
- No.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.511
Hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.181
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.977
- You get a little bored?
- A little.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.146
- Yeah. Made a snack.
- Yeah?

14:18.649 --> 14:21.568
- What'd you have?
- Just a sandwich.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.821
Turkey. A little mustard.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.031
- Sounds good.
- It really was.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.912
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.166
Let me tell you about this chick
I scored with last night.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.379
- Oh, no, wait a minute, that was you.
- Heh.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.716
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!

14:47.386 --> 14:49.262
So you, uh,
want to do something tonight?

14:49.430 --> 14:51.764
Oh, I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over again.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.643
Oh. Oh, right.

14:55.811 --> 14:59.230
Right. Because you're still seeing him,
and, uh, he's a good guy.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.523
I remember a time...

15:03.444 --> 15:06.321
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, totally.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.488
Totally. Are you?

15:07.656 --> 15:09.574
Great. It's so amazing.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.077
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I was so nervous.

15:13.245 --> 15:17.457
But after being with you,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

15:17.958 --> 15:19.375
I'll bet he can.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.212
"I don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical." Ha, ha.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.137
- You sure you're okay?
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.522
Aah!

15:43.025 --> 15:44.567
My God! Barry!

15:44.735 --> 15:47.987
- You said you'd be away all weekend!
- Oh!

15:48.155 --> 15:51.115
That's right, I'm sorry. I am early!

15:51.283 --> 15:54.243
Finish, please!

15:59.083 --> 16:02.627
Surprise, look who's back.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.462
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.339
Call security.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.300
Pheebs, uh, didn't you get fired?

16:09.468 --> 16:10.969
Heh, I don't think so.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.889
- Phoebe?
- Jack! Hey. Ha, ha.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.725
- What are you doing here?
- All better. Back to work.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.103
This clown from research
told me I was fired.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.480
He should do his research, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.692
Well, you were fired.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.194
Nuh-uh.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.488
I told that guy
who answered your phone.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.908
Oh, okay. I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.244
- Anyway, I'll be in my office.
- Ah, heh.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.746
Phoebe, you don't have an office.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.249
All right, I'll work right here.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.835
This is good. Next to this plant.

16:45.045 --> 16:47.755
- Phoebe, let's...
- You're in my office.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.386
Look, I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!

16:53.554 --> 16:57.181
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake...

16:57.349 --> 16:59.308
You lost 13 million dollars.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.394
So now this is all about money?

17:02.479 --> 17:04.981
You know, it's bad enough that...
Ow!

17:05.148 --> 17:07.316
Oh, you have got to be kidding.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.819
- Are you all right?
- I'm having another heart attack.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.990
- What?
- I'm having another heart attack!

17:14.157 --> 17:16.617
Call 911!

17:16.785 --> 17:18.578
Dumb-ass!

17:20.789 --> 17:22.373
Pheebs, how's it going?

17:22.540 --> 17:25.042
They fired me,
and I'm having a heart attack.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.502
- Well, welcome back.
- Yeah.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.717
- Hi, Ross.
- Hi, Rachel.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.678
- Is Joey Tribbiani here?
- Um, no.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.348
If you see him, please tell him
that I'm looking for him...

17:39.516 --> 17:43.478
...and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!

17:44.813 --> 17:47.482
- Are you okay?
- Me? I'm great!

17:47.649 --> 17:50.318
I'm fine! I'm so good.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.154
But you know who's not great?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.530
Men!

17:54.698 --> 17:56.240
- You're a man, right, Ross?
- Yeah.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.159
- Sit down.
- Okay.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.370
Let me, uh, ask you something.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.792
Do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?

18:07.503 --> 18:10.254
Why is it that the second
we go out of town...

18:10.422 --> 18:14.008
...bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.305
We're sorry.

18:20.307 --> 18:25.269
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.399
- Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
- Oh, what are you, a detective?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.613
I don't know what's going on
with you and your husband...

18:35.781 --> 18:38.407
...and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.371
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.039
- Ugh.
- Hey, there are some men...

18:45.207 --> 18:47.750
...who'll do whatever
to make their marriage work.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.461
There are some men
who will stand by and watch...

18:50.671 --> 18:55.258
...as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a "twosome"...

18:55.509 --> 18:58.928
...with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!

19:00.139 --> 19:02.140
Who are these men?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.725
Just men. A guy I know.

19:04.893 --> 19:08.729
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife...

19:08.897 --> 19:11.065
...is gay.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.984
She is not...

19:17.781 --> 19:19.532
She's gay.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.870
Oh, my God.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.957
She is so gay!

19:31.712 --> 19:33.963
I can't believe this.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.049
Good day for married people, huh?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.888
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.599
I'm sorry your wife is gay.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.563
- I guess women aren't that great either.
- Try telling my wife that.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.156
- Okay to come in?
- Yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.366
Dr. Roger got beeped again.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.994
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?

20:07.080 --> 20:10.291
- What?
- I'm the ruptured spleen. Ha, ha!

20:11.919 --> 20:15.504
- Why would you do that?
- Because you shouldn't be with him.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.676
You should be with me.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.306
- Really?
- When you were talking about Roger...

20:25.474 --> 20:27.892
...that was killing me. Look.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.394
Things like last night don't just happen.

20:30.562 --> 20:34.732
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women...

20:36.944 --> 20:40.863
...in the morning, I couldn't wait
to just go hang out with my friends.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.407
But with you...

20:44.618 --> 20:48.287
...heh, I was, you know,
already with a friend.

20:49.122 --> 20:52.708
- Chandler.
- You probably don't want to go out with me.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.587
I make too many jokes,
I've never been in a serious relationship...

20:56.755 --> 20:59.423
...and I guess I'm not
technically a "doctor."

21:07.683 --> 21:09.892
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.270
No, there were two.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.355
- Including me?
- Oh, yeah.

21:20.112 --> 21:25.074
It only takes two heart attacks
To finally make you see

21:25.242 --> 21:30.329
One of them won't do it
But the second will set you free

21:32.874 --> 21:37.586
Tell all your hate and anger
It's time to say goodbye

21:37.754 --> 21:40.214
And that is just what I will do

21:40.382 --> 21:43.175
Soon as those bastards I worked for die

21:46.346 --> 21:50.558
La, la-la la, la la la la la la
La la la, la la la-la-la la
