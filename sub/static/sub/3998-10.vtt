WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:02.658
Nick!
We need to talk.

00:02.725 --> 00:03.725
Winston stays.
End of discussion.

00:03.793 --> 00:05.061
No, dude.

00:05.128 --> 00:06.228
I got your
Thanksgiving invitation.

00:06.296 --> 00:08.530
(music playing, turkey gobbling)

00:10.232 --> 00:12.633
- Did you make this?
- Absolutely not.

00:12.701 --> 00:14.335
He's announcing Thanksgiving!

00:14.403 --> 00:17.439
With his little trumpet,
he's announcing the feast!

00:17.506 --> 00:18.606
It's so funny...
(laughing)

00:18.674 --> 00:20.408
(turkey gobbling)

00:20.476 --> 00:21.916
We should name that
little guy Roger.

00:21.944 --> 00:24.378
When your testicles fell off,

00:24.446 --> 00:26.880
did you form lady parts,

00:26.948 --> 00:28.949
or is it kind of like
a Gonzo nose down there?

00:29.016 --> 00:30.284
It's really interesting.
Yeah.

00:30.351 --> 00:31.918
You see, the thing is,

00:31.986 --> 00:33.220
my testicles haven't fallen off...
Right.

00:33.288 --> 00:34.621
...it's just
the morning.

00:34.689 --> 00:36.856
And my testicles do
this really unique thing

00:36.924 --> 00:39.126
of burrowing...
when it's cold out.

00:40.494 --> 00:42.695
You're burning me.

00:42.762 --> 00:43.929
- I gotta be real with you.
- Please.

00:43.997 --> 00:45.531
I know how a guy can get, like,

00:45.599 --> 00:46.865
lost in a relationship.

00:46.933 --> 00:49.435
I've been there, dude.
You're snuggling,

00:49.503 --> 00:50.470
you're snuggling,
you're snuggling,

00:50.537 --> 00:51.770
and then, bam!

00:51.838 --> 00:53.672
Next thing you know,
you're wearing

00:53.740 --> 00:56.008
a jean skirt and a tube top
with no panties on,

00:56.076 --> 00:57.476
because you guys
said you were gonna

00:57.543 --> 00:59.311
dress up like each other
for Halloween.

00:59.378 --> 01:00.712
But she doesn't
dress up like you.

01:00.779 --> 01:02.481
But you still go to the party.

01:02.548 --> 01:04.282
I could not be
more sorry for you,

01:04.349 --> 01:05.483
but that's not my story.

01:05.551 --> 01:06.485
Stand up.

01:06.552 --> 01:08.786
Stand up?
Yeah.

01:08.854 --> 01:10.155
Okay.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.121
Are those Jessica's
pajama bottoms?

01:17.162 --> 01:18.329
It's, uh...

01:18.396 --> 01:19.863
football player pants for, uh,

01:19.931 --> 01:21.198
br-breast cancer awareness.

they hug my gronk.

JESS:
<i>Camping on Thanksgiving?</i>

01:36.514 --> 01:39.849
It might be a crazy Nick idea,
but I kind of like it.

01:39.916 --> 01:41.917
I thought you hated
camping and nature.

01:41.985 --> 01:43.919
You said you were
afraid a fly was gonna

01:43.987 --> 01:45.921
fly in your head and
learn all your thoughts.

01:45.989 --> 01:47.456
I am a man,

01:47.524 --> 01:48.924
and men belong in wilderness.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.661
It really means a lot to me.

01:51.728 --> 01:52.928
The only thing I care about

01:52.996 --> 01:55.097
is that we're all together.

01:55.165 --> 01:56.605
And that we can all
sit down together

01:56.667 --> 01:57.867
and have a nice dinner.

01:57.934 --> 01:59.368
I 100% agree.

01:59.435 --> 02:00.469
I think everybody's
gonna love this idea.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.070
Me, too.

02:02.138 --> 02:03.905
- Camping? - Like we're animals?
- What the hell?

02:03.973 --> 02:05.006
Come on.
Hear him out.

02:05.074 --> 02:05.907
Let's face it.

02:05.975 --> 02:07.142
Our indoor Thanksgivings

02:07.209 --> 02:08.408
haven't been so great.

02:08.477 --> 02:10.411
Turkey!
Dead body!

02:10.479 --> 02:11.379
I think I'm into your mother.

02:11.446 --> 02:12.914
So this can't be worse.

02:12.982 --> 02:14.502
Thank you, Jessica,
I got it from here.

02:14.516 --> 02:17.018
All right.
This Thanksgiving,

02:17.086 --> 02:20.421
I want to honor the traditions
of our forefathers.

02:20.489 --> 02:22.623
The mighty Pilgrims
and Native Americans

02:22.691 --> 02:25.193
who came together
in order to survive.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.827
Sure, yeah.

02:26.895 --> 02:28.996
The first chapter in
a proud history of cooperation.

02:29.064 --> 02:31.666
It'll be the ultimate test
of manhood

02:31.733 --> 02:33.533
and our survival skills.

02:33.601 --> 02:35.034
- It will?
- WINSTON: How's this

02:35.102 --> 02:36.969
for a test of our manhood?
We stay at home,

02:37.037 --> 02:38.317
we drink beer,
we watch football.

02:38.339 --> 02:40.207
Manhood.
I like that idea.

02:40.274 --> 02:41.974
Winston, I'm talking
about real men.

02:42.042 --> 02:43.643
Me, too.
Men who fend for themselves.

02:43.711 --> 02:45.144
You're the laziest man I know.

02:45.213 --> 02:46.413
Okay, Jess, be honest with me.

02:46.414 --> 02:47.581
Has he ever been on top?

02:47.648 --> 02:49.449
Real men are on the bottom.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.717
No, they're not.
(laughing)

02:50.784 --> 02:51.718
- You're on the bottom...
- Guys, guys.

02:51.785 --> 02:53.019
It's Thanksgiving.

02:53.087 --> 02:54.787
We need to be together.

02:54.855 --> 02:55.788
Who's in?

02:57.024 --> 02:58.257
Come on, guys!

02:58.325 --> 02:59.658
- All right, I'm in.
- What?

02:59.727 --> 03:00.727
- Yeah, Schmidt!
- Yes!

03:00.794 --> 03:01.961
Look, my parents
were super divorced

03:02.029 --> 03:03.495
and they never took me camping,

03:03.563 --> 03:05.397
but I always thought
that I'd be incredible at it.

03:05.465 --> 03:06.631
Let's get ready.

03:06.699 --> 03:07.799
WINSTON:
<i>What the hell</i>

03:07.867 --> 03:09.334
<i>is on your head, Schmidt?</i>

03:09.401 --> 03:10.962
SCHMIDT: <i>It's an exact
replica of the hat.</i>

03:11.003 --> 03:11.903
<i>Viggo Mortensen wore</i>
<i>in</i> Hidalgo.

03:11.971 --> 03:12.938
<i>Knew you'd like it.</i>

03:13.005 --> 03:14.039
(Jess chuckles)

03:17.376 --> 03:18.243
JESS:
Wow!

03:18.310 --> 03:19.811
Nice job, Miller!

03:19.879 --> 03:21.246
This spot's beautiful.

03:21.313 --> 03:22.546
NICK:
I know.

03:22.614 --> 03:24.982
- Cece!
- Cece's here?

03:25.050 --> 03:26.450
I didn't know she
was gonna be here.

03:27.652 --> 03:29.453
Yay, I'm so happy you came!

03:29.520 --> 03:30.955
(laughs) We're all together!

03:31.022 --> 03:32.556
- It makes me so excited.
- Of course!

03:32.624 --> 03:34.058
I mean, what could be better

03:34.126 --> 03:35.826
than camping in the woods
with my ex-boyfriend

03:35.894 --> 03:37.327
and his friend
I just made out with.

03:37.395 --> 03:38.561
<i>With whom</i> you just made out.

03:38.629 --> 03:39.462
- Don't.
- It's very important.

03:39.529 --> 03:40.730
You know I hate that.

03:40.798 --> 03:41.838
- Don't.
- Grammar's important.

03:41.866 --> 03:43.099
Seriously, don't.

03:43.167 --> 03:44.567
If it get awkward,
I'll come save you.

03:44.635 --> 03:46.535
Happy Thanksgiving!

03:46.603 --> 03:47.904
JESS:
Yay!

03:47.972 --> 03:49.105
(chuckles)

03:49.173 --> 03:50.539
Hey, what's up, girl?

03:50.607 --> 03:52.175
Hey, Cece.

03:58.547 --> 04:00.415
(clears throat)

04:02.118 --> 04:03.451
Hey, I never, uh...

04:03.519 --> 04:04.440
had a chance to ask you.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.888
How did the, um...

04:05.955 --> 04:07.089
How'd your guys' date
go the other night?

04:07.157 --> 04:08.590
- Oh, with Cece?
- Yeah.

04:08.658 --> 04:10.391
Uh... it was...

04:10.458 --> 04:11.725
I loved it.

04:11.794 --> 04:13.127
I mean, it was good.

04:13.195 --> 04:14.328
It was cool.

04:14.396 --> 04:15.763
That's great.

04:15.831 --> 04:16.898
Super.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.966
- Super-duper.
- So where you thinking

04:20.035 --> 04:22.336
- about pitching, uh, pitching a tent?
- Thinking over there.

04:22.404 --> 04:23.905
- Oh, yonder?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.072
- Yonder. - Listen, I've been
researching on the Internet

04:26.140 --> 04:27.707
for the past 12 hours

04:27.775 --> 04:29.342
everything there is
to know about the wood.

04:29.410 --> 04:31.878
Now I'm a...
I'm a master camper.

04:31.946 --> 04:33.980
So if you need any help
with anything,

04:34.048 --> 04:35.748
just come to me and ask, okay?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.083
(chuckling):
Thanks, man.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.251
I don't know anything
about the wood.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.619
I know everything.
I'm lost.

04:39.687 --> 04:40.620
What is that, a tree?

04:40.688 --> 04:42.154
If these trees were skyscrapers,

04:42.222 --> 04:43.789
- you'd feel very comfortable.
- Yeah.

04:43.857 --> 04:45.691
I'd be right at home.
Unfortunately,

04:45.758 --> 04:47.193
- they're actual trees.
- (chuckling): Yeah.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.261
You're the best.
I love the hat!

04:49.329 --> 04:51.897
I'm sorry, is that a
solar cell phone charger?

04:51.965 --> 04:55.567
Yeah, I can't go more
than two days without it.

04:55.635 --> 04:59.170
(quietly): Okay, hold on. Do you...
do you hate camping, too?

04:59.238 --> 05:02.340
Are you kidding me?
I absolutely hate camping.

05:02.407 --> 05:04.508
Then why are we here?

05:04.576 --> 05:06.711
Because I didn't get a say.
I never get a say.

05:06.778 --> 05:09.147
Whenever I want to do something,
they don't give a hoot.

05:09.215 --> 05:11.549
Guess who just got free passes
to a pottery seminar.

05:11.616 --> 05:12.576
- Get out of here.
- Winston!

05:12.617 --> 05:13.517
We could've made

05:13.585 --> 05:15.986
the craziest mugs, man.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.055
(grunts)

05:18.122 --> 05:20.324
- Hey, Nick?
- Yeah.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.826
There's just beer in here. That should
last us for the first few hours,

05:22.894 --> 05:24.094
- actually.
- Where's the food?

05:24.162 --> 05:25.662
Where-where are all
the pies I made?

05:25.730 --> 05:27.164
Look, don't worry, Jess.

05:27.232 --> 05:31.100
'Cause the food is...
right here.

05:31.168 --> 05:34.403
I'm... sorry.
I don't understand that gesture.

05:34.471 --> 05:37.039
We're gonna be hunting
and foraging for our dinner,

05:37.107 --> 05:39.441
just like the Indians
and the Pilgrims.

05:42.445 --> 05:44.646
But you brought beer.

05:44.714 --> 05:46.674
You can't forage for beer.
And that's a necessity.

05:47.716 --> 05:49.150
So this is Thanksgiving meal?

05:49.218 --> 05:51.219
96 warm beers?

05:51.287 --> 05:52.420
We can do this.

05:52.488 --> 05:53.989
Guys, we've gotten soft!

05:54.056 --> 05:56.358
With our antibiotics
and our sports creams.

05:56.425 --> 05:59.794
Do you think George
Washington had a pet cat?

05:59.862 --> 06:00.795
Yeah. No. He didn't.

06:00.863 --> 06:02.263
He hunted them.
What?

06:02.330 --> 06:04.331
And he made milk and butter

06:04.399 --> 06:06.367
out of their spoils.
That's terrible.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.834
So you're saying George
Washington milked his cat?

06:07.903 --> 06:09.436
Nothing is sounding accurate right now.
Not at all.

06:09.504 --> 06:10.371
Where'd you read this?
I'm not saying

06:10.438 --> 06:11.372
it's gonna be easy.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.539
It's gonna be hard.

06:12.607 --> 06:13.774
But we will emerge

06:13.841 --> 06:15.776
out of this better friends

06:15.843 --> 06:17.477
and a tribe.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.711
I'm on board.
(chuckles)

06:18.779 --> 06:20.013
Going old-school.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.148
Men! Killing! Hunting!
Men!

06:22.216 --> 06:23.349
SCHMIDT, COACH and NICK:
Men! Men! Men! Men!

06:23.417 --> 06:25.084
Oh, my cowman's...
my cowman...

06:25.152 --> 06:27.053
my cowman's hat,
my cowman's hat.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.821
WINSTON:
Guys, look,

06:28.889 --> 06:30.790
I'm as much a man
as anybody here,

06:30.857 --> 06:32.558
but this plan is
straight-up dookie.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.326
I need my sweets and
I need my parade.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.094
Yeah, you know what?
I'm out, too.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.530
Guys, guys, guys. Look.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.265
We're together.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.100
We're a family.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.601
It's Thanksgiving.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.137
And I'm sure Nick
has a plan. Right?

06:45.204 --> 06:46.604
- Oh, yeah. I've got a plan.
- Great.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.506
- You got a plan?
- The man's got a plan.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.442
These wilderness guides
right here detail what plants

06:51.509 --> 06:53.978
are safe for eating
and what traps we can build.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.813
Unfortunately,
I ran out of money,

06:55.880 --> 06:57.280
so I couldn't print out
the chapters

06:57.282 --> 06:58.816
on gutting and skinning, but...

06:58.883 --> 06:59.850
we'll worry about that
when we get there.

06:59.918 --> 07:01.152
Pilgrim rules.

07:01.219 --> 07:02.920
Men, hunters!

07:02.988 --> 07:04.855
Women, foragers.

07:04.923 --> 07:06.363
I'm not hunting.
The only Hunt I want

07:06.424 --> 07:07.958
is Bonnie or Helen.

07:08.025 --> 07:08.891
You know what I'm
talking about, Coach.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.160
What?

07:10.227 --> 07:11.761
Nick.

07:14.024 --> 07:16.546
This is perfect.
Primal man in nature.

07:16.613 --> 07:19.348
Stalking prey. Who's basically
the lady now, Coach?

07:19.416 --> 07:21.717
I've seen that tree six times
in the past 20 minutes.

07:21.785 --> 07:24.019
We're definitely moving
in a small circle.

07:24.087 --> 07:26.722
NICK: Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna clear a path this way.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.457
We will travel northbound,
I believe.

07:28.525 --> 07:30.058
That's not north;
that's south.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.726
That is south?
Then let's travel southbound.

07:31.794 --> 07:33.728
I'm gonna clear a path.
If something's in there

07:33.796 --> 07:36.598
and you get injured, I promise
you I will kill you fast.

07:36.666 --> 07:37.632
(groans)

07:37.700 --> 07:40.235
Scat! Scat.

07:45.607 --> 07:48.041
There's an animal nearby. Hey,
Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.

07:48.109 --> 07:49.943
That's not a raisin.
This is scat.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.877
Okay.

07:52.747 --> 07:54.014
(coughs)

07:54.082 --> 07:55.282
(clears throat)

07:55.350 --> 07:56.717
That's poop for sure.

07:56.784 --> 07:58.252
I was right.
In your face, Nick.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.553
- In your face, Nick.
- How so?

07:59.621 --> 08:01.388
I don't know, he put a...
put a turd in his mouth.

08:01.456 --> 08:02.923
- And that's in my face?
- Yeah.

08:02.990 --> 08:04.624
I don't think we should
start eating

08:04.692 --> 08:06.159
poo yet, Schmidt.
Let's wait on that.

08:06.227 --> 08:07.194
You want to chase
that with some dirt?

08:07.261 --> 08:08.261
Does anyone have any gum?

08:08.329 --> 08:09.830
No.

08:09.897 --> 08:11.798
Not that I wanted any
in the first place.

08:14.969 --> 08:16.436
That's a mighty
big hole there, Nick.

08:16.503 --> 08:17.637
You trying to catch
a refrigerator?

08:17.705 --> 08:19.038
It's a bear hole.

08:19.106 --> 08:20.773
Bear falls in,
other stuff falls in.

08:20.874 --> 08:22.241
We take what the bear
doesn't want.

08:22.308 --> 08:24.276
Makes sense.
Classic human/bear team-up.

08:24.344 --> 08:25.811
I'm from Chicago.
It's the best I can do.

08:25.879 --> 08:27.213
Yeah, bears love to share.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.313
What are you planning
on doing with

08:28.381 --> 08:29.514
that bear when he falls
into the hole?

08:29.582 --> 08:30.916
Dude, I'm trying
the best that I can!

08:30.984 --> 08:32.317
We have no food.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.719
Let me explain something
to you, Nick.

08:33.785 --> 08:35.153
When you're building a trap,

08:35.221 --> 08:36.554
you want to customize it
to your prey.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.155
So, I don't know, if was trying

08:38.224 --> 08:39.857
to catch, say a squirrel,

08:39.892 --> 08:42.126
I'd want think like a squirrel.

08:42.193 --> 08:43.761
Allow me to demonstrate
with this trap that I built.

08:43.828 --> 08:45.396
How do you get into the mindset
of a squirrel?

08:45.464 --> 08:47.331
(clicking tongue)

08:47.399 --> 08:49.400
I'm a squirrel... right?

08:49.468 --> 08:50.634
You do that really well.
Look at this!

08:50.701 --> 08:51.802
Oh, there's some nuts here.

08:51.870 --> 08:52.836
Look at all these little nuts.

08:52.904 --> 08:54.704
You might not want to do that.

08:54.773 --> 08:56.673
If I needed your advice on how
to lead a spinning class,

08:56.741 --> 08:58.108
I'd ask you,
but this is my territory.

08:58.176 --> 08:59.576
(Schmidt yells)

08:59.644 --> 09:01.278
- My scapula!
- Dude, are you all right?

09:01.345 --> 09:03.713
Aah! Aah, get it off! Aah!

09:03.782 --> 09:04.848
(Schmidt groaning)

09:04.916 --> 09:06.916
Get it!

09:06.984 --> 09:08.684
Get up.
Keep breathing, man.

09:08.752 --> 09:10.186
I don't mean to be laughing,

09:10.254 --> 09:11.888
but are you okay?
I'm gonna make you a sling.

09:11.955 --> 09:13.355
You're gonna make me a what? You
don't know how to do that. A sling.

09:13.423 --> 09:15.691
- Of course I do.
- What...?

09:15.759 --> 09:18.127
- What are you doing?
- I was an Eagle Scout.

09:18.195 --> 09:20.462
What are you talking about,
you were an Eagle Scout?

09:20.530 --> 09:22.063
- Look.
- That's actually really good.

09:22.131 --> 09:23.431
I'm sorry, dude.

09:23.499 --> 09:24.699
You wanted to be
the best at camping.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.401
You were so excited
about your hat.

09:26.468 --> 09:28.336
I didn't want to get
in the way of that.

09:28.404 --> 09:29.504
Plus with the whole Cece thing
or whatever.

09:29.571 --> 09:31.439
What are talking about?

09:33.075 --> 09:35.277
You're gonna let me
be the best camper.

09:35.344 --> 09:37.545
I am the best camper!
Yeah.

09:37.613 --> 09:39.746
I think this is chicory.

09:39.815 --> 09:41.215
It says you can eat the root.

09:41.283 --> 09:42.883
Or it's jasmine.

09:42.951 --> 09:44.952
Which will kill you.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.188
Hmm.
What do you guys think?

09:47.255 --> 09:48.655
- I'm sure it's fine.
- Yeah, just eat it.

09:48.723 --> 09:49.756
Hey, raspberries!

09:49.825 --> 09:52.526
There... Ow!
(laughs): Ow.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.360
There are a lot
of brambles in here.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.129
There's a country store
not far from here.

09:56.197 --> 09:57.917
Ow! Three and a half stars.
The reviews say,

09:57.965 --> 09:59.498
"It's functional and dusty."

09:59.566 --> 10:01.067
- Ow!
- Sounds good to me.

10:01.135 --> 10:02.902
This is so fun.
Who wants to help?

10:02.970 --> 10:03.903
This plan is

10:03.971 --> 10:04.904
officially the worst.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.505
We are starving.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.709
Just admit, you don't want
to do this, either.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.409
Okay, listen up.
Only stuff we can find

10:11.477 --> 10:13.312
in the forest, right?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.781
Look at that fish.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.350
It's perfect.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.684
What?
Oh, I'm gonna grab it.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.954
I'm so hungry.
Now we get to eat, boys.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.755
Dude, that looks dead.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.023
Guys, stop being
negative right now.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.690
Laying on its side
means it's dead.

10:26.758 --> 10:28.592
I wouldn't get
in that water, man.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.394
You're gonna get beaver fever.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.663
Where are my
testicles now, Coach?

10:32.731 --> 10:34.398
When he catches that little
critter, I'm gonna show you

10:34.466 --> 10:35.399
how to scale it.

10:35.467 --> 10:36.367
Ow.

10:36.434 --> 10:37.368
That hurts?

10:37.435 --> 10:38.369
Yeah, it hurts!

10:38.436 --> 10:40.171
A boulder fell on my...

10:40.239 --> 10:41.505
Is all this 'cause I teased you

10:41.573 --> 10:42.472
about the invite?

10:42.539 --> 10:43.806
Yes, it is! No regrets!

10:43.875 --> 10:45.508
(grunts)

10:45.576 --> 10:47.077
Aw!
Aw, come on, Nick.

10:47.144 --> 10:48.511
(yells)

10:48.579 --> 10:50.413
NICK: Yes! Quit it.

10:50.481 --> 10:52.648
You guys might be right!
It might be dead!

10:52.716 --> 10:55.252
In fact, it was dead!

10:55.319 --> 10:57.220
Smells fresh...

10:57.288 --> 10:58.687
enough!

10:58.755 --> 11:00.422
Oh, come on, Winston, what?

11:00.490 --> 11:02.457
You just get your nails done?
Get the apple dirty!

11:02.525 --> 11:04.526
Grind some dirt in it,
grind some dirt in it.

11:04.594 --> 11:06.896
God, I'm so hungry!
Hey, hey!

11:06.963 --> 11:08.663
Hey.
Look what the men brought.

11:08.731 --> 11:10.766
Oh, hey! Hey, hey!
The plan worked.

11:10.833 --> 11:11.800
Hey, he looks like a fighter.

11:11.868 --> 11:14.402
He really was, kind of.

11:14.469 --> 11:15.403
- Oh, my God!
- Wow.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.305
I mean, well...
Whoa.

11:17.373 --> 11:19.207
Like a smorgasbord.
You guys did great.

11:19.275 --> 11:20.641
- Yeah, we did.
- Yep.

11:20.709 --> 11:22.010
Where'd you get the cashews?

11:22.077 --> 11:24.279
- Um, on a bush.
- Yeah.

11:24.346 --> 11:25.513
How about the beets?

11:25.580 --> 11:27.681
- Also a bush.
- That's right.

11:27.749 --> 11:28.716
Yeah.

11:28.784 --> 11:29.583
The avocado?

11:31.152 --> 11:33.954
- Also on a bush.
- That's right.

11:34.022 --> 11:35.755
Well, look at us.
Living off the land,

11:35.823 --> 11:37.190
fending for ourselves.

11:37.258 --> 11:39.393
We got fish and fruits,

11:39.460 --> 11:40.627
and this is probably gonna be

11:40.694 --> 11:41.661
the most delicious apple

11:41.729 --> 11:43.563
I've ever eaten in my life.

11:48.435 --> 11:49.568
"Product of Oregon"?

11:49.636 --> 11:51.870
We walked to Oregon?

11:51.939 --> 11:53.639
- What?
- What?

11:53.706 --> 11:55.774
That's why this cramp...
Yeah... This place...

11:55.842 --> 11:57.443
Come on, you think the three
of us are true dumb-asses?

11:57.510 --> 11:58.344
We're not. I kind of
knew from the beginning.

11:58.412 --> 11:59.845
I mean, there's no way.

11:59.913 --> 12:01.613
You just went to a store
and got all this?

12:01.681 --> 12:03.281
I think so.

12:03.349 --> 12:05.590
I think they definitely bought
everything from the store.

12:05.617 --> 12:08.786
The one thing I wanted was for
us all to sit down together

12:08.854 --> 12:11.722
and have dinner, and you
can't do that without dinner.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.425
We have dinner.

12:13.492 --> 12:15.053
That fish kind of looks
like hippo meat.

12:15.061 --> 12:15.994
Come on, man.

12:16.062 --> 12:17.062
Let's just sit down

12:17.129 --> 12:18.195
and eat some delicious almonds.

12:18.263 --> 12:19.629
- And enjoy ourselves.
- Yes.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.565
And have a really nice
Thanksgiving together.

12:21.632 --> 12:23.500
- Come on, Nick, let's eat.
- Come on, man, let's eat.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.928
I feel like how they must've
felt on the first Thanksgiving.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.138
Betrayed.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.440
What?

12:29.507 --> 12:31.308
Happy Thanksgiving.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.177
- Oh, come on. Nick, come on!
- Don't do this.

12:33.244 --> 12:35.111
FYI, the first Thanksgiving
was the good one.

12:35.179 --> 12:36.479
WINSTON:
Come on, Nick!

12:36.546 --> 12:38.577
These avocados were expensive!

12:39.336 --> 12:40.736
Here we go.

12:40.804 --> 12:41.971
It smells so good.

12:42.039 --> 12:43.199
I can't wait till it's ready.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.474
I'm gonna be so stuffed.

12:44.542 --> 12:45.708
Ooh!

12:45.776 --> 12:46.942
The eyeball fell off.

12:47.010 --> 12:49.312
That's how you know it's good.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.214
They got to pop out
when it's ready, I think.

12:52.282 --> 12:53.849
Now that the cards
are finally on the table,

12:53.917 --> 12:56.085
I guess we can see who
the true camp master really is.

12:56.153 --> 12:58.187
The answer's me.
First one to make a flame wins.

12:58.254 --> 13:00.556
Let's do this.

13:00.623 --> 13:03.192
Now, check this out.

13:03.259 --> 13:04.694
This is how you make a flame.

13:04.761 --> 13:06.728
You go with two rocks.
One against the other.

13:06.796 --> 13:08.997
You create friction.

13:09.065 --> 13:10.598
- I'm done.
- What?

13:10.666 --> 13:11.632
I'm done.
Well, that's

13:11.701 --> 13:13.267
barely a flame, it's going out.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.536
Whoa! Well, goodness gracious!
What are you? A sorcerer?

13:16.438 --> 13:17.906
Damn it!

13:22.443 --> 13:24.712
Hey, mountain man.

13:24.779 --> 13:26.947
You want to come eat some
dirty vegetables with us?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.481
I should've known those beets
weren't from nature.

13:28.549 --> 13:30.851
Nothing purple grows in nature.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.953
Look, we didn't
come through, okay?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.855
You came through!

13:36.324 --> 13:38.191
Look, you caught a fish!

13:38.258 --> 13:39.458
That's really,
really impressive.

13:39.526 --> 13:40.459
How'd you do it?

13:40.527 --> 13:42.829
With my bare hands.

13:42.896 --> 13:44.597
- No way! You're so strong.
- Yeah.

13:44.664 --> 13:46.498
Yeah, it was... It fought...

13:47.601 --> 13:49.235
What are you doing?

13:49.302 --> 13:51.070
I'm not doing anything.
I think that's amazing.

13:51.138 --> 13:53.672
You provided for us.

13:53.740 --> 13:55.807
- You're a man.
- Don't patronize me, Jess.

13:55.875 --> 13:59.111
I'm not. Ever since we
started dating, Jess,

13:59.178 --> 14:01.179
we've been doing
a bunch of girly stuff,

14:01.247 --> 14:03.648
and I like some of it
and you, but...

14:03.716 --> 14:05.416
my tolerance
to alcohol has, like,

14:05.484 --> 14:07.853
gotten really, scary low.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.054
I drank three beers, and I got,

14:10.122 --> 14:11.722
like, all giggly and tired.

14:11.790 --> 14:13.323
And I didn't want a fourth.

14:13.391 --> 14:14.558
Last night, I had a dream

14:14.626 --> 14:16.526
that I was brushing a horse.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.696
I just feel like
I'm losing myself a little.

14:19.765 --> 14:21.198
Just...

14:21.266 --> 14:23.000
let me eat
this disgusting fish and...

14:23.068 --> 14:25.369
- No, Nick, Nick.
- Yeah, just let me be over here.

14:25.436 --> 14:27.603
This is the most beautiful fish
I've ever seen.

14:27.671 --> 14:29.438
Don't touch... I wouldn't touch it.
It is! It is.

14:29.506 --> 14:31.775
Jess, don't...
Don't put your hands in...

14:31.842 --> 14:32.842
Oh, my Lo...

14:35.379 --> 14:36.212
Spit it out.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.083
Mmm...!

14:40.151 --> 14:42.117
Mmm...!

14:42.185 --> 14:43.952
Mmm...!

14:44.020 --> 14:45.353
Fragrant.

14:45.421 --> 14:49.691
Mmm, I can really...
I can really taste the lake.

14:49.759 --> 14:51.426
Spit it out.
I feel like I'm there

14:51.494 --> 14:52.761
in the lake with the fish.

14:52.829 --> 14:54.096
Mmm!

14:54.164 --> 14:56.131
Bony.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.365
That's gonna hurt going down.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.135
But I like it.

15:01.203 --> 15:05.039
Hurts so good! Hurts so good!

15:05.107 --> 15:06.473
Jess, that fish was dead
when I caught it.

15:06.541 --> 15:08.209
There was a sock near it.

15:08.277 --> 15:10.111
(suppressed gagging)

15:12.981 --> 15:15.415
I'm gonna come with you.
No.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.683
Jess, let me come with you.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.951
Where are you going?
There's something over here.

15:18.019 --> 15:19.286
I'm gonna look at it.
Jess...

15:19.353 --> 15:23.123
I'm seeing
some interesting things.

15:23.191 --> 15:25.625
I'm out of the office
till Friday.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.994
For immediate assistance,

15:28.062 --> 15:30.629
please call Deb at extension
A.C. Slater.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.631
(grunts)

15:32.699 --> 15:34.066
You guys see where she went?

15:34.134 --> 15:35.100
- No.
- No. Jess?

15:35.168 --> 15:35.668
- Jess?
- Jess?

15:35.735 --> 15:36.768
Jess!

15:36.837 --> 15:37.937
- Jess?
- Jess?

15:38.004 --> 15:39.471
NICK:
Jess?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.106
Jess!

15:41.174 --> 15:43.442
I just want to see
more carpet samples

15:43.509 --> 15:45.311
before I make a final decision.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.545
(gags) Jess!

15:47.612 --> 15:49.480
CECE:
Jess?

15:49.548 --> 15:52.616
NICK:
Jess! Jess, where are you?

15:52.684 --> 15:54.319
Jess!
Jessica!

15:54.386 --> 15:57.155
NICK:
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.756
And you know what, Coach?

15:58.824 --> 16:00.191
I did like the invitation.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.392
I made it. And I liked
the little trumpet guy.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.693
I thought he was cute.

16:03.761 --> 16:05.628
- He was cute as a damn button!
- What?

16:05.696 --> 16:07.197
So many st...

16:07.265 --> 16:08.531
Hey, guys, look.
There she is!

16:08.599 --> 16:10.667
There are dogs
that have dollar signs

16:10.735 --> 16:13.370
but don't even own banks.

16:13.437 --> 16:14.518
- Jess, we're over here!
- Jess!

16:14.572 --> 16:15.839
Wait, wait, wait.

16:15.907 --> 16:17.741
I've seen that tree before.
Jess, stop!

16:17.808 --> 16:19.441
The bear trap!
(gasps)

16:19.509 --> 16:22.078
- No!
- I'm coming!

16:22.145 --> 16:23.312
Jess!

16:25.415 --> 16:28.633
Headfirst? Why?
(Nick groans)

16:29.959 --> 16:32.226
(groans) Son of a...
(gasps)

16:32.294 --> 16:33.995
Oh, my God, Jess,
I am so sorry.

16:34.063 --> 16:35.429
I was an idiot.

16:35.497 --> 16:38.066
This Thanksgiving plan
was so stupid.

16:38.133 --> 16:40.167
You shouldn't have eaten
that fish. I'm sorry.

16:40.235 --> 16:41.702
Don't let them
pay the bill, okay?

16:41.769 --> 16:42.769
You bring the check to me.

16:42.770 --> 16:45.639
No arguments, moon man.

16:45.707 --> 16:47.074
CECE:
Oh, my God!

16:47.142 --> 16:48.709
Is anyone hurt?

16:48.776 --> 16:51.178
We're fine.
I may have cracked a few ribs,

16:51.246 --> 16:54.014
and, uh, Jess is delirious.

16:54.082 --> 16:55.615
I think she thinks
she's a rabbit.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.642
Guys, we're gonna figure
something out, all right?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.685
NICK: Just get us a rope
or a stick or something.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.321
All right, man, so, any ideas?
What are you talk...?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.828
You know what, Coach?
Don't humor me.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.457
- What?
- You know what to do.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.791
Look, I admit it. You're
a better camper than I am.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.194
You're better at life
than I am.

17:08.262 --> 17:09.862
You're probably better
at dating Cece than I am.

17:09.930 --> 17:12.063
I saw you guys the other night

17:12.132 --> 17:14.398
inhaling each other
in front of the loft.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.035
Schmidt, that's all we did.
That was it.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.904
I asked her to come upstairs,
she said no, okay?

17:19.972 --> 17:22.241
And now she won't return
any of my text messages.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.608
She's been ignoring me
this whole trip.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.111
I'm all, like, "Hey."
She's like, "Mm-hmm."

17:26.179 --> 17:28.579
I'm like, "What?"

17:28.647 --> 17:30.948
Why are you smiling, dude?
I'm not smiling.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.450
I'm over here baring
my soul to you, dude,

17:32.518 --> 17:33.551
and you're freaking
smiling in my face. Yeah.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.019
This is the face I make
when I listen.

17:35.086 --> 17:36.687
All your teeth show when you listen?
I'm not.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.523
You're smiling right now.
I opened up to you.

17:38.590 --> 17:39.890
You're pissing me off. Stop smiling.
I'm not.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.692
I will wreck you.
You're crazy, man.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.926
You're nuts.
Stop it, listen to me.

17:42.994 --> 17:44.727
We are going to solve
this right now.

17:44.795 --> 17:46.062
All right, take your pants off.

17:46.130 --> 17:47.197
Okay, I am no Eagle Scout,

17:47.265 --> 17:49.299
but I know how
to make a pants rope.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.000
- Pants rope.
- You're a genius.

17:51.068 --> 17:53.036
I know. Okay. Are you gonna
take off your pants?

17:53.103 --> 17:55.238
Yeah, right after I take off my bra so
we can anchor the rope to the tree.

17:55.306 --> 17:57.174
- That's gonna happen for real?
- Just take them off now.

17:57.241 --> 17:59.642
(laughing):
Whoa, look at Winston's pants.

17:59.709 --> 18:00.942
It's got kittens on it.

18:01.010 --> 18:02.478
These aren't kittens.

18:02.546 --> 18:03.945
I cannot believe I'm
here voluntarily.

18:04.013 --> 18:04.813
So stupid.
Take them off.

18:04.881 --> 18:06.415
They're coming off.

18:06.483 --> 18:09.818
CECE: Here, you guys,
grab hold of the rope.

18:09.886 --> 18:11.920
Okay, you go first, Jess.

18:11.988 --> 18:13.955
I'll be right behind you
to support you.

18:14.023 --> 18:16.724
- Ding, dong, ding, dong!
- What are you doing?

18:16.792 --> 18:18.593
Okay, how about this? Get on
my back, I'll bring us both up.

18:18.661 --> 18:19.661
Back at you.

18:19.728 --> 18:21.262
Whoa.
(coughs)

18:21.330 --> 18:22.330
You can do it!

18:22.398 --> 18:24.599
There, hold
this flashlight, buddy.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.534
Grab hold.
(blows raspberry)

18:26.602 --> 18:27.635
- Come on, Nick! Come on.
- Here we go!

18:27.703 --> 18:29.637
Oh, God, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

18:29.705 --> 18:31.072
(straining)

18:31.139 --> 18:33.407
Use your legs, Nick.

18:33.474 --> 18:34.841
(grunting)

18:34.909 --> 18:36.210
Come on, Nick!

18:36.277 --> 18:37.711
Come on.

18:37.778 --> 18:39.979
- Ah, Winston, I hate your leggings.
- Come on.

18:40.047 --> 18:41.481
Almost there.

18:41.549 --> 18:42.649
- Let's go.
- You got it,

18:42.717 --> 18:43.850
you got it.

18:43.918 --> 18:44.884
You got it, you...

18:44.952 --> 18:48.020
(straining)

18:48.088 --> 18:49.589
(all exclaim)

18:51.124 --> 18:52.124
(sighs)

18:52.192 --> 18:53.626
You chubby son of a bitch.

18:53.694 --> 18:55.494
Yeah.
(groans)

18:55.562 --> 18:56.762
You okay, Jess, you all right?

18:56.763 --> 18:58.397
Yeah!

18:58.465 --> 19:00.299
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:00.367 --> 19:01.667
ALL:
Oh!

19:06.205 --> 19:07.972
Hey.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.775
Thanks for saving me,
mountain man.

19:10.843 --> 19:13.245
So I've got good news
from the doctor:

19:13.312 --> 19:15.280
you don't have rabies.

19:15.348 --> 19:16.514
Oh.

19:16.582 --> 19:18.149
You have, uh, giardia

19:18.217 --> 19:20.851
and something called
Legionnaires' disease.

19:20.918 --> 19:23.887
I'm just glad they were
able to save your foot.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.922
What?

19:25.990 --> 19:27.524
No, nothing.

19:27.592 --> 19:29.126
Never mind.

19:29.193 --> 19:30.026
(chuckles)

19:31.763 --> 19:35.798
Hey, I'm sorry about
the whole camping thing.

19:35.866 --> 19:37.400
Oh, no, it's okay.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.801
Ah, I was really stupid.

19:38.869 --> 19:40.370
I haven't been myself.

19:41.572 --> 19:43.572
You're the man I want.

19:46.041 --> 19:47.442
All you wanted was for everyone

19:47.510 --> 19:50.178
to be together
on Thanksgiving, Jess.

19:50.246 --> 19:53.014
Next year.

19:56.886 --> 19:58.219
Potato chips.
Chips?

19:58.287 --> 19:59.553
Maybe a treat.

20:04.793 --> 20:07.795
Listen, Coach, uh,
in the spirit of Thanksgiving,

20:07.862 --> 20:09.463
I thought maybe
that I could give you

20:09.531 --> 20:12.065
some advice about...
about Cece.

20:12.133 --> 20:13.834
How desperate do
you think I am?

20:13.902 --> 20:14.967
I think you're probably
very desperate.

20:15.035 --> 20:16.002
I'm very desperate, I mean,

20:16.069 --> 20:17.537
she's giving me nothing.

20:17.605 --> 20:19.539
Told her she looked
pretty, she said thanks.

20:19.607 --> 20:20.973
Mm-hmm. What kind of
mind game is that?

20:21.041 --> 20:23.209
Look, Coach, things have
always come easy to you.

20:23.277 --> 20:26.613
Cece is not going to be
one of those things.

20:26.681 --> 20:27.914
I once spent hours

20:27.981 --> 20:31.684
in a car with just
a cracked window for air.

20:31.751 --> 20:33.018
She was going into a club

20:33.085 --> 20:35.387
and she just kind of
left me there.

20:35.455 --> 20:37.623
Why are you smiling about that?

20:37.691 --> 20:40.158
Hey, guys, I figured out
a way to save Thanksgiving.

20:40.226 --> 20:41.993
I got a plan. SCHMIDT:
Enough with the plans.

20:42.061 --> 20:43.462
You suck at plans!
Not another Nick Miller plan.

20:43.530 --> 20:44.730
I love you, man, but you
are terrible at plans.

20:44.798 --> 20:46.364
Hey.

20:46.432 --> 20:49.867
It's still 11:48, so
happy Thanksgiving.

20:49.935 --> 20:51.736
What?

20:51.804 --> 20:54.305
Got us some Brazilian nuts,
a couple of string cheeses, and.

20:54.373 --> 20:55.506
Snack.

20:55.574 --> 20:56.741
Thank you.

20:56.809 --> 20:57.875
WINSTON:
I got the parade on my phone.

20:57.943 --> 20:58.876
Yes.

20:58.944 --> 21:00.578
Made some decorations.

21:00.646 --> 21:01.846
I think this may be
a turkey sandwich,

21:01.913 --> 21:03.847
but I'm not sure,

21:03.914 --> 21:05.716
and I know
this whole thing isn't...

21:05.783 --> 21:06.717
It's perfect.

21:06.784 --> 21:08.518
Look, guys, start without me

21:08.586 --> 21:11.187
because it might be a few weeks
before I can eat again.

21:11.255 --> 21:13.156
(all laughing)
You were throwing up a lot.

21:13.224 --> 21:14.290
(laughs)

21:14.359 --> 21:18.027
That was scary...
seriously.

21:18.095 --> 21:19.862
Okay, I'm starving actually. Let's eat.
Yeah, let's eat.

21:19.929 --> 21:21.163
Nick found all this food
in the woods.

21:21.231 --> 21:22.431
(all laughing)

21:22.499 --> 21:23.766
Can I have the ginger ale?

21:23.834 --> 21:25.803
Yeah, Nick found that.
It's already open.
