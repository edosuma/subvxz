JACK DYLAN GRAZER:
The relationship between
Fraser and Caitlin is...

52:52.500 --> 52:53.667
I think unlike any other
on the show.

52:53.750 --> 52:55.500
At this point her and Fraser
are really close,

52:55.583 --> 52:58.333
so you see the two of them
looking at each other,

52:58.417 --> 53:00.417
instead of her looking at
the rest of the group.

53:00.875 --> 53:03.208
Moments where the two of them
are just sitting together.

53:03.291 --> 53:04.834
So I think she's definitely--
she's starting to get

53:04.917 --> 53:07.709
that feeling of isolation
and that separation,

53:07.959 --> 53:10.667
being more so with Fraser
and less with the group

53:10.750 --> 53:12.000
that she's always known.

53:13.083 --> 53:16.041
She's finally found that person
that just so accepting of her,

53:16.417 --> 53:18.709
and she doesn't want
to lose him, so,

53:18.792 --> 53:21.208
naturally she just gravitates
toward him,

53:21.291 --> 53:23.125
and she makes sure she keeps
him right by her side,

53:23.208 --> 53:24.458
and she doesn't let him go.

It's not the way it used to be.

Something really is changing.

53:30.625 --> 53:31.709
FRASER: What is this place?

It's a Russian villa without

the entirety of the episode,

53:44.458 --> 53:47.667
represents a sort of Eden

I think my favorite scene
is when we're all dancing.

Luca was very specific in like,
what he wanted us to do.

Each of them is doing something
crazy and depraved,

-It's hard.

-Why you gotta--?

It was a food fight.

-Jack.

everybody was throwing spaghetti
