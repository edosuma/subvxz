01:38.974 --> 01:42.888
- I do not like this.
- It is Odin's wish.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.727
It is not right, father.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.821
Prepare yourselves!

02:08.628 --> 02:11.622
Your greed will doom us.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.530
Father ...

02:40.202 --> 02:41.488
Go back.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.952
Behind you!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.601
- Hello.
- Morning.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.205
Brage, have you been
on my computer again?

05:40.966 --> 05:44.175
There were lots of those strange emails again.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.339
- Spam?
- Yes. Ragnhild?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.963
I've told you to buy a new one.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.011
Two.
Because you owe me one.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.509
Guess we're taking the bus today.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.190
Well, you guys are overdressed.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.688
Is it anyone's birthday today?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.237
No.
It's graduation.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.369
Ragnhild is going to sing.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.366
Yes... It's three o'clock today.
In the gym?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.789
It will be ace.
Ok, see you then.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.029
Do you know what time it is?

06:47.032 --> 06:49.524
It is 22 minutes past nine.

06:49.534 --> 06:54.074
We're talking about over a million dollars here.
Three more years of research.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.701
And you?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.663
Stick to the facts.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.209
Yes, yes.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.048
Facts.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.086
The Oseberg ship represents -

07:10.096 --> 07:16.058
- the largest and most spectacular
Viking find in history.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.521
In this wonderful tumulus
we found the remains of -

07:20.523 --> 07:24.642
- what we think is the Queen Aasa
and her serf.

07:24.653 --> 07:28.897
The Oseberg discovery has given us
an unique understanding of this period.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.025
However, we are constantly making new discoveries.

07:32.035 --> 07:36.029
Since the reconstruction, the 
common perception has been that -

07:36.039 --> 07:39.453
- the ship was used only
for short trips -

07:39.459 --> 07:42.122
- around Toensberg.
(The south-east of Norway, close to Oslo)

07:42.796 --> 07:45.789
But on the keel boards of the
ship we found these.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.924
These are microscopic shells.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.261
And they only live
on the coast of Finnmark.
(the Northern most part of Norway)

07:57.894 --> 08:01.888
The Oseberg Vikings
may have been in Finnmark.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.183
And that is absolutely stunning.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.025
Totally up in Finnmark !

08:11.032 --> 08:14.946
Disregarding the shells, do you 
have any more evidence of this?

08:14.953 --> 08:16.660
Is this all you have?

08:22.836 --> 08:26.830
Obviously there are other things
we could mention.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.966
Yes?

08:49.404 --> 08:53.819
What you must understand is that
Oseberg tumulus is completely different -

08:53.825 --> 08:56.317
- than anything else we've found.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.410
Everything you see in this room -

08:58.413 --> 09:01.531
- was buried with the
Viking Queen Aasa.

09:01.541 --> 09:06.286
You'd think they'd made it easy
for us to understand, but it has not.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.873
For these are the only runes -

09:09.883 --> 09:12.216
- they found on the ship.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.463
"Litet vis maor."

09:17.140 --> 09:18.847
Man -

09:18.850 --> 09:20.261
- knows -

09:20.268 --> 09:21.884
- little.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.440
Man knows little.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.150
So what was it they knew -

09:35.366 --> 09:37.073
- that we do not?

09:38.286 --> 09:43.827
We found the heads of five animals in the grave. 
Aasa was cradling this one in her arms.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.950
And this here ...

09:45.960 --> 09:49.704
It might look like
it's just a pattern.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.213
But it is not.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.961
I have studied this for years.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.303
And it is not accidental.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.172
These ...

10:02.393 --> 10:04.134
are runes.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.472
and what it says here ...

10:12.153 --> 10:13.985
is Ragnarok.
(Ragnarok means doomsday)

10:13.988 --> 10:15.604
- Come again?
- Ragnarok.

10:15.615 --> 10:20.781
We have never before found "Ragnarok" 
written in runes anywhere.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.450
I think Aasa knew
much more than we realize.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.042
She died with a secret.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.040
There lies in the Oseberg tumulus -

10:34.050 --> 10:37.794
- the answer to the riddle of Ragnarok .

10:40.223 --> 10:42.385
We know what it means.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.177
- The world's downfall.
- That's what everyone thinks.

10:46.187 --> 10:50.807
I think the origins of the myth
about Ragnarok was a real event.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.856
Something happened.
Something that was so big -

10:54.863 --> 10:58.277
- that it changed
throughout the Norse mythology ...

10:58.283 --> 11:00.320
Oh, come on!

11:00.326 --> 11:03.410
This is so far-fetched.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.032
"Man knows little. "
That's the truth!

11:07.041 --> 11:09.784
Sorry, but Sigurd has gone a little  ...

11:10.253 --> 11:14.463
If we knew it was this kind of
nonsense our money was being spent on, -

11:14.465 --> 11:17.754
- we had withdrawn our financial 
support several years ago.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.253
This is simply too foolish.
Enough is enough.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.149
We have no evidence to support
that is what you say!

11:34.152 --> 11:38.613
I haven't told you anything. I can
go through all the documentation with you.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.073
I'm not the only one who believes this.
Maren ...

11:41.075 --> 11:45.740
Maren's dead. We're all sorry about
that. But that was six years ago.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.488
Five years ago.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.043
You have hardly been
outside the office since.

11:56.049 --> 12:01.135
Do you have any idea what Allan is
doing up there in Finnmark?

12:04.224 --> 12:07.843
There's going to be an open 
position for a guide in the fall.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.141
I suggest that you apply for it, Sigurd.

12:57.610 --> 13:01.024
I had that meeting at work today.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.363
It took more time than ...

13:04.200 --> 13:06.533
than I had thought.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.893
Have you and Ragnhild fallen out?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.900
No.

13:43.906 --> 13:48.867
She's probably just upset
for the graduation business.

13:48.870 --> 13:52.238
It is not so easy on your own.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.377
But there are other fish 
in the sea.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.045
- Ok. Where?
- On the Internet.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.798
Brage?

14:11.559 --> 14:15.428
- Oops, I fat-fingered a button.
- No, you didn't.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.054
What did you write?

14:17.065 --> 14:21.651
I wrote that you are an archaeologist
and you like all things Viking.

14:21.652 --> 14:25.271
Okay.
And did you write how old I am?

14:25.281 --> 14:26.863
Yes ...?

14:26.866 --> 14:30.450
I got a message
from a woman who's 57.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.112
57?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.739
Do you think that's a good match?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.412
No.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.909
Dad?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.877
Where are we going for vacation?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.830
Hey.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.456
Come in.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.210
Where are we going for our summer holiday?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.676
- I haven't ...
- Maiken is going to the Mediterranean.

14:51.682 --> 14:55.141
- So is Gunnar is.
- Gunnar is Gunnar.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.137
I must admit that I was thinking -

14:58.147 --> 15:01.481
- that maybe our cabin would be nice?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.726
We're not going to the cabin!

15:04.654 --> 15:07.897
Let's go to the Mediterranean
and have a real holiday?

15:07.907 --> 15:12.402
- I want to bring my snorkel and dive in the ocean.
- You can swim in the pond at the cabin.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.247
You like that. Come on!
We have lots of good memories from the cabin.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.956
<i>You</i> have.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.043
Come on, Brage.
It's time for bed.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.845
- Did you brush up top?
- Um ... yes?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.932
"Uh ... yes?"
Does that mean you have not done it?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.025
- Maybe.
- Did you brush in the back?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.859
Yes, I have.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.196
Anything the matter?

15:50.199 --> 15:54.409
I just think that you're probably right. 
We need some sun.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.871
Maybe experience something new, you know.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.912
I won't believe it
until I see it, dad.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.127
Good night.

16:06.841 --> 16:10.630
It's probably just PMS.
I hope I don't get it.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.923
- Sleep well, then.
- Good night.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.235
Hey.
Why aren't you answering your phone?

16:29.322 --> 16:33.316
- Have you stopped reading your mail?
- Did you talk with the museum?

16:33.326 --> 16:37.946
Whatever. I was going to 
come and show you this anyway.

16:37.955 --> 16:42.746
- There have been things happening her today.
- Nothing is more important than this.

16:42.752 --> 16:49.215
There's no point trying to use a car
to find the places where Viking ships 
might have docked.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.381
It is completely out.
Can't believe we didn't think of that!

16:52.386 --> 16:54.002
I can do it.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.596
I was about to give up.
Then I rented a boat.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.808
Started to thread my way up the coast.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.426
And there it was!

17:02.647 --> 17:06.060
For three years I have been up and down
the coast of Finnmark -

17:06.067 --> 17:10.607
- Without finding so much as
a sea urchin fossil.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.613
And then ...

17:21.665 --> 17:23.999
- Would you get it out.
- Ok.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.789
- Will you grab the bag?
- Yes. Get it out.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.918
A rune stone.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.765
Get my stuff.
They're over by that globe there.

17:40.768 --> 17:46.105
I'll be there when we present
it. I found it, right?

17:55.616 --> 18:00.031
- Museum guide? As if.
- What?

18:00.037 --> 18:04.122
- Henriksen stopped the project today.
- Why?

18:04.125 --> 18:08.460
We won't get any more money.
He doesn't believe in all this.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.957
We don't give two shits about Henriksen!
He'll just slow us down, anyway.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.628
Those aren't words, you know.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.302
Do you see i ?
It's like it's in code.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.897
It is as if
we are missing something.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.436
- There is something in the middle here.
- What?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.705
It looks kinda familiar, huh?

18:59.805 --> 19:03.298
Hey, this might actually be illegal.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.925
You work here, you know.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.144
Suddenly it feels like trespassing.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.311
Trespassing? You've got the key!
You're supposed to lock up.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.152
That was not hard, now was it?

19:16.155 --> 19:21.651
- If Henriksen finds out ...
- He's not going to get all the credit for this.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.221
I just want to know your secret.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.348
Forgive me.

20:12.378 --> 20:17.248
There must be some kind of code key.
Just have to get it right ...

20:18.384 --> 20:20.376
It must be there.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.548
- Yes, here it is.
- What?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.549
It's indicating that the O -

20:26.559 --> 20:28.221
- is an A.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.934
R ...

20:32.022 --> 20:35.015
- is a N.
- Can you find somewhere to write this down?

20:35.609 --> 20:37.441
M ...

20:43.492 --> 20:45.279
So if ...

20:47.288 --> 20:49.996
"Aasa raised the stone ... "

20:54.378 --> 20:57.121
" ... in memory of her father. "

20:58.674 --> 21:00.882
"the King of Vestfold."

21:00.885 --> 21:02.296
"As ... "

21:02.678 --> 21:05.421
"As in folly went ... "

21:07.725 --> 21:10.263
" ... to find god ... "

21:10.269 --> 21:14.013
" ... gods ... godpower ...
the power of the gods... "

21:16.108 --> 21:18.100
" Midgard ... "

21:18.277 --> 21:22.692
Something about Midgard
and then something here .

21:26.952 --> 21:28.659
" Three days ... "

21:29.246 --> 21:31.454
- What?
- Oh, look at this .

21:34.084 --> 21:36.747
"Three days march -

21:36.754 --> 21:39.087
- from this stone ... "

21:49.350 --> 21:51.717
<i>"Three days march - </i>

21:51.727 --> 21:54.094
<i> - to the bottomless lake. " </i>

21:59.109 --> 22:00.771
The eye of Odin.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.115
"Odin's Eye " .

22:09.203 --> 22:11.570
Do you know what this means, Allan?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.243
We'll be invited to Jimmy Kimmel?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.917
Getting hot, Allan .

22:18.546 --> 22:20.538
This  -

22:20.548 --> 22:22.289
- is a map.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.167
This is a set of directions.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.342
To a place where the Oseberg 
Vikings have been.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.839
Where is it?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.425
Okay.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.848
I found it ... there.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.891
Where?
And then a three-day march.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.359
How far is that, then?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.149
- 100 kilometers.
- 100?

22:45.155 --> 22:47.568
- 80, then.
- For ordinary people.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.152
Eighty kilometers.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.076
Here ...

23:03.716 --> 23:05.207
Sigurd?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.958
It's there!

23:08.345 --> 23:13.056
- There are all the answers.
- The answers? It's a treasure map!

23:15.352 --> 23:18.186
It makes perfect sense.
The Vikings sacked all over Europe.

23:18.188 --> 23:22.273
And so they needed a place
to hide everything.

23:22.276 --> 23:24.359
And then ... they went there.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.116
Should we pack our suitcases?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.077
What's this ?

23:38.542 --> 23:42.252
- Come on!
- Yes, I did.

23:42.254 --> 23:47.716
If this is what we think it is,
we can move to the mediterranean. Ok?

23:47.718 --> 23:52.634
For six years you've been trying to figure out
the secret of the Oseberg ship.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.428
Come on. It will be fun!
It will be an adventure!

23:59.438 --> 24:01.805
If Maren were here -

24:01.815 --> 24:04.683
- you'd been packing your bags right now.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.851
It will be fun.

24:10.532 --> 24:13.240
Ragnhild will understand.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.777
<i>Finnmark?</i>

24:15.788 --> 24:22.001
My God, there's plenty of sun in Finnmark.
It's sunny all day. Midnight Sun.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.461
- Promise you that we can swim there?
- Yes, there are lots of lakes.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.672
Awesome.
Plus degrees.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.293
- Ragnhild?
<i>-Dad, Finnmark?</i>

24:31.303 --> 24:33.545
<i>I'll bore myself to death.</i>

24:33.555 --> 24:36.639
You won't die of boredom.
It will be fun!

24:37.226 --> 24:40.936
Brage is packing his bags now .
He is ready.

24:40.938 --> 24:45.729
If you won't do it for me,
please do it for him.

24:49.655 --> 24:54.320
- It's going to cost you a computer, Dad.
- So be it.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.851
Look at this! Great.

25:29.987 --> 25:34.072
- Where is the sun, dad?
- It'll show up.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.566
- Wonderful!
- Yeah, great ... great.

25:39.955 --> 25:45.451
And she's on time as well.
Best assistant I've ever had. Hello!

25:50.174 --> 25:52.040
- Hey!
- Come on.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.923
Hello!

25:57.890 --> 26:00.098
- Hello.
- Hello. Sigurd.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.221
Elisabeth.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.093
I've heard about you.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.640
Oh, yeah?

26:05.647 --> 26:09.266
- That's nice.
- Do not be too sure about that .

26:11.195 --> 26:14.029
- The car is here.
- Ok.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.197
Odin's eye?

26:17.367 --> 26:19.780
What are we looking for?

26:19.787 --> 26:25.374
The rune stone we found? It's a map. 
Probably a treasure map.

26:25.375 --> 26:29.710
The Vikings sacked all over Europe and needed
a place to hide their riches.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.625
And they found that there!

26:32.800 --> 26:34.917
It's got to be like that.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.385
Do you tourists
know where we're going?

26:41.391 --> 26:44.930
This here is Leif.
He will help us find our way inland.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.312
Best local guide I managed to find.
Ain't that right, Leif?

26:54.988 --> 26:57.150
Cash up front?

27:20.347 --> 27:23.511
He is a great guy.
A few quirks here and there.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.555
He has spent too much time by his lonesome.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.936
Come on!

27:30.107 --> 27:31.564
Okay, let's go!

28:35.631 --> 28:39.591
It's that way, right?
That direction?

28:47.351 --> 28:49.138
In there?

28:52.731 --> 28:55.940
In there, yes.
It was there the Vikings went.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.151
A thousand years past.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.066
We'll get answers to everything now.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.775
My mom would have liked this, you know.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.991
- Hello.
- There's no signal here.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.459
That's what I said.
PMS.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.210
This was not on the map.

30:01.842 --> 30:05.006
This is the old border
between Norway and the Soviet Union.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.549
Now, it's no man's land.

30:09.766 --> 30:13.806
Has not been a man here
for 50 years. Only mosquitoes.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.140
Are you sure you want to continue?

30:27.284 --> 30:32.029
There was no border here
thousand years ago. It'll be fine.

30:52.893 --> 30:55.306
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

30:56.897 --> 31:01.392
- What are you looking for?
- You needn't worry about that.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.768
We're paying you, are we not?

31:07.491 --> 31:09.574
Are there lots of mosquitoes?

31:09.576 --> 31:11.283
Here, take this.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.290
Wait.
I'll help you.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.090
What does your mom have to say
about you going on a treasure hunt?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.042
She is dead.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.129
Oh, yes.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.677
Cancer.
Long ago.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.452
Are you coming?

32:12.889 --> 32:15.176
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.441
- Has there ever been war here?
- No.

32:30.824 --> 32:33.316
Or, well, I guess.
The cold war.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.456
Okay, let's go.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.592
This is the only lake for miles.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.437
- It's got to be here, then?
- This must be it?

33:29.424 --> 33:31.211
The eye of Odin.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.503
Ok, Maren ...

34:19.014 --> 34:21.928
- Yes?
- Yes, we are going.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.866
They did not use those in the Viking age?

34:46.876 --> 34:50.835
- Dad, can we go home now?
- No, we can not.

34:50.839 --> 34:55.254
- You do not know what you're looking for!
- Of course I do!

34:55.260 --> 34:58.173
- What?
- I am looking for answers.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.341
My God, that it is possible!

35:04.144 --> 35:06.887
So it's Doomsday (Ragnarok)
we are looking for?

35:07.522 --> 35:09.639
Hey, you know, that book is kind of important ...

35:09.649 --> 35:12.232
I have led you into
in no man's land.

35:12.235 --> 35:15.148
Surely I deserve to know where we're going?

35:15.155 --> 35:16.646
Ragnarok?

35:17.073 --> 35:18.860
Do you believe in fairy tales?

35:20.368 --> 35:26.285
We're trying to find out what happened
with the Vikings here a thousand years ago.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.954
I'm serious.

35:30.337 --> 35:31.703
Give me the book.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.268
Look at that.

38:38.274 --> 38:42.109
What can you get for that on eBay?

38:54.916 --> 38:57.954
I wonder what happened to them.

39:01.798 --> 39:07.260
Judging by that wire, they drove 
across the ice and got stuck.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.589
Either way they do not need these anymore.

39:16.896 --> 39:21.015
We are in the right place, you see.
We just have to ...

39:24.821 --> 39:27.859
It must have been hard for you.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.279
Ragnhild told me.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.244
Yeah, of course ...

39:35.290 --> 39:40.285
It has been difficult for the 
kids to let her go.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.628
It is not so easy to forget.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.547
You don't need to forget.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.794
You carry your past with you,
whether you want it or not.

39:49.804 --> 39:55.675
For example, I have my exes name 
tattooed here still. Unfortunately

39:55.685 --> 39:57.392
That's just how it is.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.637
Yes.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.310
That's how it is.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.233
<i>Daddy!</i>

40:05.862 --> 40:07.228
<i>Daddy!</i>

40:12.869 --> 40:15.111
What are you doing?

40:15.121 --> 40:17.488
I found a cave.

40:26.007 --> 40:29.045
Do you know how dangerous
those caves can be?

40:29.052 --> 40:32.921
Yes, I know.
You should not be here by yourself.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.111
Brage?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.993
There is something over there.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.382
That's a long way down!

41:27.527 --> 41:29.644
<i>Wow. Such space. Much volume. </i>

41:38.871 --> 41:40.612
Hey?

41:40.623 --> 41:43.832
If you've got any last words ,
now's the time to let them out.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.750
What?

41:49.007 --> 41:51.249
Oh, yes.
It goes ...

41:51.259 --> 41:52.716
Okay.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.101
Looks like fits like a glove.
Thank you.

42:02.103 --> 42:03.765
I'm ok.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.530
Want me to help you, or what?

42:35.845 --> 42:37.552
Wow!

43:21.849 --> 43:23.511
My God!

43:27.605 --> 43:29.096
They've been here!

43:30.149 --> 43:31.685
They were here!

43:32.193 --> 43:34.526
I do not know what to say !

43:36.489 --> 43:38.071
Hello!

43:38.616 --> 43:40.278
A Viking helmet.

43:40.284 --> 43:44.995
There's only been one find of a
Viking helmet throughout northern Europe.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.909
It is unbelievable!

43:46.916 --> 43:50.830
Kimmel is too smalltime for this.
This is David Letterman material!

43:51.462 --> 43:52.748
Minimum!

43:57.051 --> 43:59.543
We have been right all along.

44:00.179 --> 44:02.421
The Vikings were here.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.424
Where did you find it?
There might be a lot more.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.221
- Here.
- Where?

44:07.228 --> 44:09.515
It was right here.

44:09.522 --> 44:14.893
Everyone be extra careful.
It can be anything.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.362
Dad!

45:01.365 --> 45:03.197
<i> - Dad </i>
- Hold on.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.659
<i> - See it here ! </i>
- Just wait a bit.

46:01.300 --> 46:05.010
Imagine Henriksens reaction.
He's going to drop dead on the spot.

46:08.432 --> 46:11.425
I'm thinking about how we're going
to transport this.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.896
There is so much stuff. To get it down to
the museum in Oslo is not an easy task.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.686
- What do you mean?
- Huh?

46:19.527 --> 46:23.362
- Are you saying we should give this up?
- It is not ours.

46:23.364 --> 46:25.230
Finder's keeper's. We found it.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.408
Okay, you know what?

46:28.411 --> 46:32.246
We are archaeologists.
We adher to the Cultural Heritage Act.

46:32.248 --> 46:35.491
You probably have no idea what that means.

46:35.501 --> 46:41.168
Here's a guy who doesn't respect
anything and never did.

46:41.173 --> 46:44.086
You don't have a moral fibre in your being!
This belongs in a museum.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.044
Okay.

46:49.682 --> 46:53.551
- What was the point of that?
- He doesn't get it ...

47:00.985 --> 47:03.477
This isn't going to any fucking museum.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.524
It's not funny !

47:12.163 --> 47:15.577
Now put these toys away neatly.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.374
Now!

47:35.102 --> 47:37.515
They can't take the stress of being transported ...

47:40.608 --> 47:43.726
Well, aren't you the worlds best archaeologists.

47:44.445 --> 47:48.029
Goddamnit, you cannot just leave us here!

47:49.075 --> 47:52.659
You must send someone to help us get out.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.277
Sure.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.200
Will do.

47:56.207 --> 47:57.368
Yes, yes!

48:33.119 --> 48:35.406
- What's this?
- Get it off!

48:35.413 --> 48:37.075
What the hell is that?

48:42.169 --> 48:43.330
Look here!

48:43.337 --> 48:46.546
- It's just an old corpse.
- Only?

48:53.681 --> 48:56.048
I want to go home.
I want to go home now!

50:38.244 --> 50:41.203
Are you sure this is wise?

50:41.205 --> 50:43.288
Do you have a better idea?

51:40.681 --> 51:42.468
Great!

51:43.559 --> 51:45.266
Gorgeous!

51:49.732 --> 51:51.940
That went ok, right?

52:07.249 --> 52:11.789
We'll sleep here tonight,
and we'll get started on a new raft tomorrow.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.255
This could be cozy?

52:27.770 --> 52:31.104
Cozy?
Where the hell do you live?

52:31.106 --> 52:35.271
I don't have a place.
I live in my suitcase.

52:35.819 --> 52:37.401
What about your family?

52:38.947 --> 52:41.781
Family is not really my thing.

52:59.343 --> 53:01.380
This was my chance.

53:05.891 --> 53:08.884
I've waited so long for this.

53:17.820 --> 53:20.062
What are we not seeing?

53:20.072 --> 53:22.940
We found some helmets and swords.

53:22.950 --> 53:26.785
They would not have traveled here
to hide it. That can't be true.

53:26.787 --> 53:29.575
There's something that just doesn't
make sense ...

53:51.937 --> 53:53.644
Sigurd?

53:58.193 --> 53:59.934
Let's have a look.

54:05.033 --> 54:07.025
What is it?

54:07.035 --> 54:08.776
I do not know.

54:08.787 --> 54:13.407
But I know that I
really want to find out.

54:14.209 --> 54:15.791
We have to go back down.

55:17.105 --> 55:20.644
It goes further in on other side.

55:59.314 --> 56:01.306
This is a tomb.

56:21.795 --> 56:24.754
- What's that noise?
- I do not know.

57:03.045 --> 57:05.583
Elisabeth?

57:15.057 --> 57:16.389
Elisabeth?

57:39.790 --> 57:41.372
It's just a baby.

57:44.336 --> 57:46.419
Maybe it's hungry?

58:31.133 --> 58:33.170
It is very hungry.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.602
Wonder what else it eats?

58:47.065 --> 58:48.727
Elisabeth!

58:52.154 --> 58:53.690
What the hell?!

59:04.499 --> 59:06.115
Let me have a look.

59:14.676 --> 59:16.463
Imagine.

59:16.470 --> 59:21.056
More than 50 species perish from this 
Earth every day.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.849
That's a lot of animals.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.598
In a thousand years.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.523
Allan?

59:32.569 --> 59:35.607
What if the animal head on the -pillars -

59:35.614 --> 59:38.072
- are made in the image of a real animal?

59:38.784 --> 59:40.616
That lived here -

59:40.619 --> 59:42.531
- a thousand years ago.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.257
See!

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.427
Look ...

01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:27.780
Son of a ...!

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:40.002
He died the same way as the Vikings .

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.547
What? They died a thousand years ago.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:47.804
He didn't.

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.051
It must know a way out.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:08.801
The kids!

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.183
Out!

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.845
Get out!

01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:41.398
It's jammed!

01:03:46.114 --> 01:03:48.197
Daddy, help!

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:51.025
Help!

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.284
We are being dragged down to the water!

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:01.289
Help!

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.795
The door is jammed!
Get us out!

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:16.762
Allan!

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.726
We can't open the door!

01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:24.691
Dad, save us!

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:30.614
Open the door!

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.329
Open the door!

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:56.924
Come on!

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:08.944
Go, go, go!

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:12.531
Dad!
No!

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:41.560
Get away from the water!

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:59.453
- What the hell was that?
- I do not know.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.995
- What was that?!
- Dad, what was that?

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:08.254
How is that even possible?

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:10.585
It's ok, Brage.

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:12.254
Everything will be ok.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.552
Everything will be ok.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.471
Everything will be ok, Brage.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:31.026
We just have to get out of here.

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:35.490
We have to get out of here
one way or another.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:40.032
Yes, but how the hell are we
going to cross the water?

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:17.778
- Do you think it can pursue us on land?
- Fucking hope not.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.660
<i>Allan </i>

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.296
Hey.
Did you find anything ?

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:29.682
Yes, I ... I found it here.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:33.683
I think it can work pretty well
if we attach the hook to ...

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.113
Do not miss.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.118
I'm just saying.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.862
Yes! It's stuck right in there.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.082
Allan, you go first.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:47.430
- I do not know if I can do this.
- It will be fine.

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.310
Okay.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.062
Letting go.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.977
Are you sure it is not dangerous ?

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:43.980
Hey?

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.027
I'm absolutely sure of it.

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:49.026
Allan will catch you, you know.
Ok?

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.579
Good boy.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.959
Yes, clear.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.873
It's stuck here!

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:28.417
I'll get it loose.

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:39.894
I'm coming out.

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:28.940
It's ok.

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:43.784
Elisabeth!

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:48.213
You have to get up here!

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:56.968
Dad!

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:08.024
Watch out!

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:33.792
Swim!

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.294
No!

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:29.019
It's ok, Brage.
It's ok now .

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:09.763
What was it?

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.145
I do not know.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:29.453
The bunker!

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:48.973
The lock!

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.604
Dad!

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.028
Over here!

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:10.740
Come on!

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.521
We must split up.
Find a way out.

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:22.313
- Did you find anything?
- No. You?

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.235
- Did you find anything?
- No.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:28.193
We are trapped .

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.198
- No ...
- You're shitting me!

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:48.680
- You know what you've done?
- Ragnhild ...

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:51.470
- This is your fault!
- I'm sorry.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.936
Do you think I wanted
it to be like this?

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:57.431
I would just figure it out.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.353
Hey sweetie  ...

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:28.272
What does it really say?

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:41.246
It's about a Viking king who ...

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:48.543
<i>That brought the men here </i>
<i>to capture "the beast of Midgard". </i>

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:57.259
<i>It was the only part of the runes </i>
<i>I could not decipher. </i>

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.479
<i> Aasa ... </i>

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:06.776
<i>She must have been </i>
<i>the only one who survived. </i>

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:11.026
<i>The runestone was not a map.</i>

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.490
<i>It was a warning. </i>

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:19.698
<i>A warning </i>
<i>that her father would not heed. </i>

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:29.124
And they died here because he ...

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:36.303
Because he didn't realize that maybe
they never should have -

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.015
- been here.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.455
Isn't that ventilation piping?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.922
Then they'll lead us out.

01:22:24.731 --> 01:22:26.313
Come on.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:38.944
Come on.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.074
Up this way.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.825
Come on!

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:04.678
- We can do it.
- Yes, it's going to work.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:06.520
Grab the shelves!

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:11.226
Come on!

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:28.041
- Got the rope?
- Yes.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:31.086
Come on!

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:36.675
Okay.

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.357
A little higher!

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.067
Come on!

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:11.244
Yes!

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:17.750
Okay.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.533
Give me the bag.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:44.072
Come on.

01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:55.000
Give me the bag.

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:58.504
What are you doing?

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.503
For six years I've been searching for
this secret.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:04.426
And people just laughed at us, Sigurd .

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:06.595
Allan, this is not good.

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:10.186
- I'll bring the animal home.
- You know what?

01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:13.477
Toss down the rope,
and we'll forget about this.

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:16.271
- I'll take the beast with me.
- Stop that!

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:19.145
Shut the fuck up!
Come on, give me the bag!

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:26.569
Come on.

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:39.875
Allan!

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.693
Dad?

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:00.667
Ragnhild?

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:21.851
Hush, Brage.
You must be quiet.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:26.231
Where is dad?

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.982
I do not know.

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.615
You must be completely silent.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.592
Absolutely quiet.

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:48.251
<i>Daddy!</i>

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.011
Dad!

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:06.766
Dad!

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:15.323
<i>Ragnhild</i>

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.278
Dad!

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:21.451
Ragnhild!

01:32:18.324 --> 01:32:20.190
Dad!

01:32:28.334 --> 01:32:30.291
Sorry, Ragnhild.

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:35.672
I'm sorry.

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:54.232
Elisabeth?

01:32:56.946 --> 01:32:58.687
Elisabeth?

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:12.083
Hey.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.747
Hey.

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:27.300
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I think so.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:06.107
<i>This is totally awesome, Sigurd!</i>

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:10.157
First Aasa brooch surfaces again,
and now this !

01:35:10.163 --> 01:35:13.907
This is going to shine
an entirely new light on it all.

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:17.456
Do you even realize
the possibilities this opens up?

01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:19.749
Sponsors will queue up!

01:35:19.756 --> 01:35:25.297
- Was it outside Bergen you found it?
- That's right. A little south of Bergen.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:28.717
I can gather the sponsors
by tomorrow morning.

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:30.510
I quit.

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:34.097
- What?
- I'm taking a position as a history teacher.

01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:38.473
Short days, long vacation.
Great for the family, you know.

01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:46.522
Okay. Is everyone ready
for three weeks at the cabin?

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:51.865
- Where are we going?
- We're going to Spain!
