I am so happy right now.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.623

24:10.666 --> 24:13.147
Oh, my God, we spent 18 months

24:13.190 --> 24:15.366
and 11 days
in a P.O.W. camp together.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.107
How did this never come up?

24:17.151 --> 24:18.195
Right?

24:18.239 --> 24:19.980
I mean, why wouldn't you
share that?

24:20.023 --> 24:21.460
Yeah, come on,
Thomas is right, Theodore.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.678
You have deprived us

24:22.722 --> 24:24.506
of years of
ragging on you.

That is not cool, man.

thoroughly enjoying
this pointless conversation,

24:29.163 --> 24:31.165
can we just table it
until the case is solved?

24:31.208 --> 24:33.646
That's cool with me.
I got to go back to work anyway.

24:33.689 --> 24:34.821

Crack Midi's cell phone.
If you can help with that,

24:44.221 --> 24:47.268
then maybe we can get a lead
on who his partner was.

24:47.311 --> 24:50.053
If you think it will assist
in finding Jack's murderer,

24:50.097 --> 24:51.533

want to talk,

I know what it's like
to lose someone you care about.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.471
Jack and I
weren't lovers, Magnum.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.648
Yeah, but I can tell there was
something special there, so...

25:21.694 --> 25:24.261
He was my friend.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.456
that I have those paintings.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.021
No. I was alone.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.023
Look, Detective,

28:41.067 --> 28:44.244
you're too smart to think
that I actually did this,

28:44.287 --> 28:46.072
or do you think I'm dumb enough

28:46.115 --> 28:48.770
that I'd put the lease
under my own name?

28:51.642 --> 28:53.253
I don't know you,
Magnum,

28:53.296 --> 28:54.907
so I don't know
how dumb you are.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.213
What I do know

28:57.257 --> 29:00.782
is that every P.I. I've ever met
is a bottom-feeder

29:00.826 --> 29:02.958

be trusted.

29:03.002 --> 29:05.091

You know anything
about that?

29:10.270 --> 29:13.447
Okay, this has been really fun,
but, uh, I think I'm done.

29:13.490 --> 29:14.665
See you.

just walk out of here?

Yes, I do.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.890
You know why?

29:21.934 --> 29:24.240
No cuffs. I'm not under arrest,

29:24.284 --> 29:26.416
which means this is a
voluntary interview,

29:26.460 --> 29:29.071

from a crime scene.

How about I arrest you for that?

29:33.772 --> 29:34.990
Then I'll lawyer up,

29:35.034 --> 29:36.992
and you'll have done nothing
but waste time.

Look, Detective,
I don't know you, either,

29:39.821 --> 29:41.692
but being who
Candler was,

29:41.736 --> 29:44.304
I'm sure you're under a lot
of pressure to make an arrest.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.828
The problem is, is I don't think
you like me for this.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.875
In fact, I'd go so far as to say
that you think I'm being framed.

to unlock the phone.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.214
Okay, one: that's really cool.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.260

to show me how to do that.

find anything?

you doing here?

Came here to take possession
of Mr. Candler's property

30:36.617 --> 30:38.532
on behalf of his estate.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.447
He would've wanted his art
seen by the masses,

not consigned to some dark room
in a police department basement.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.973

gonna give it to you.

I know how it looks,

30:51.980 --> 30:55.331
but Magnum had nothing
to do with any of this.Really?

30:55.375 --> 30:57.681
'Cause here's how
it looks to me:

30:57.725 --> 31:01.555
he got to do a dry run,
test Jack's security,

31:01.598 --> 31:04.036
identify weak spots
and then break in again for real

31:04.079 --> 31:05.994
before we had a chance
to address the problems.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.040
Then he teamed up with
Christophe to sell the art,

31:08.083 --> 31:10.912
and I can only assume Christophe
tried to screw you in the deal,

31:10.956 --> 31:11.913
so you killed him.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.219
None of that is true.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.308
James, Magnum is many things.

31:15.351 --> 31:16.526
He's an uncultured man-child,

31:16.570 --> 31:19.051
a lazy freeloader,
a terrible driver,

31:19.094 --> 31:23.359
but he is not a thief, and he
is definitely not a killer.

31:24.795 --> 31:27.798
Well, you'll forgive me, but
given everything I've been told,

31:27.842 --> 31:29.844
I'm finding that
very hard to believe.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.331
What?

31:38.374 --> 31:42.509
"Lazy freeloader,
uncultured man-child"?

31:42.552 --> 31:44.424

31:44.467 --> 31:45.773
It's all true, by the way.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.080
What'd you find on the phone?

31:48.123 --> 31:49.864
Something rather curious.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.605
Over the last week,
Midi was in contact

31:51.648 --> 31:53.085
with a man named
Wendell Kratten.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.043
Okay. So who's Wendell Kratten?

31:55.087 --> 31:56.436
According to the California
Bureau of Prisons,

31:56.479 --> 31:58.003
he was a convicted
art forger.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.265
Art forger?

31:59.308 --> 32:01.180
I found a text Midi
sent to Kratten last week.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.964
He said that he was
gonna be brokering

32:03.008 --> 32:04.792
a large, under-the-table sale
and that someone involved

32:04.835 --> 32:06.881
had asked if he knew
any art forgers.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.014
He told Kratten that that person
would be reaching out to him.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.277
Okay, so that large
under-the-table deal

32:11.320 --> 32:12.931
must be the Candler job.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.977
Agreed. I just don't know how
the art forger figures into it.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.892
Let's ask him.

32:24.159 --> 32:27.119
Great. Probably pin this
on me, too.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.295
Head injury.

32:29.338 --> 32:30.557
Yeah, just like Midi.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.168
Probably the same killer.

32:35.214 --> 32:36.867
What is it?

32:36.911 --> 32:40.001
You see this-this blue
under the fingernails?

32:40.045 --> 32:42.743
It's made from lapis lazuli.
That's a rare gemstone.

32:42.786 --> 32:45.354
You-you just don't see
this color much

32:45.398 --> 32:47.313
past the Victorian era.

32:47.356 --> 32:50.925
Suddenly Thomas Magnum
has art knowledge.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.014
Surely it's a sign
of the apocalypse.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.668
Perhaps I should pray.

32:54.711 --> 32:56.191
There it is. You see that?

32:56.235 --> 32:58.150
Detroit Tiger blue.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.326
Remember the painting
of the, uh, Victorian lady?

33:00.369 --> 33:01.980
It had that same
color blue in it.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.636
Midi's partner must have had
Kratten forge it.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.683
But if you're right,
that makes one wonder

33:09.726 --> 33:12.425
whether HPD has the original
or the fake.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.775
Six paintings stolen,

33:14.818 --> 33:16.690
six paintings recovered.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.649
In between, one of those
paintings was secretly forged.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.217
Meanwhile, whoever's behind this
still has the original.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.914
But Jack said that
it was by far

33:23.958 --> 33:25.307
the least valuable
in the collection.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.613
Why go through
that trouble?

33:26.656 --> 33:30.312
Maybe it's more valuable
than anybody realizes.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.488
I mean, that's
the only answer that fits.

33:32.532 --> 33:34.490
You're not gonna go through the
trouble of stealing something

33:34.534 --> 33:35.491
if it's not valuable.

33:35.535 --> 33:36.927
But how could it be valuable?

33:36.971 --> 33:39.191
I don't know.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.714
But I know who would know.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.580
I'm not sure.
He was killed with a gun.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.364
It's a different M.O.,
which makes me think

34:22.408 --> 34:24.018
there was a second person
involved.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.238
I'm gonna fill in Katsumoto and
tell him to meet me at Tracy's.

34:26.281 --> 34:27.978
I'll stay here and wait for HPD.

34:28.022 --> 34:29.980
Keys.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.244
Be careful.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.594
She's an art appraiser.
I think I can handle her.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.206
Everyone's been
assuming the thief

34:38.250 --> 34:40.600
knew how to defeat
Candler's security

34:40.643 --> 34:41.731
because of my report.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.298
Hell, I even worried about it.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.126
But you know who else
could've beaten that security?

34:45.170 --> 34:46.997
An insider.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.434
[elevator bell dings]

34:50.175 --> 34:51.959
[gunshot, bullet ricochets]

34:52.002 --> 34:53.178
[screaming, gasping]

34:53.221 --> 34:54.614
Looks like James Chen
is that insider.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.529
I hate it when
my little voice is right.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.450
I don't know what's going on.
Chen's gone insane.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.983
Okay, come on, come on!

35:24.383 --> 35:26.515
So let me guess.
Chen's trying to kill you

35:26.559 --> 35:28.300
because you gave the paintings
to the cops.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.737
Look, I-I don't know what
you think is going on...

35:30.780 --> 35:33.348
I'll tell you
what I think is going on.

35:33.392 --> 35:34.654
I think you got Chen

35:34.697 --> 35:37.309
to steal the paintings,
but you didn't tell him

35:37.352 --> 35:39.746
that you were only interested
in one: the Victorian.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.356
And I don't know how,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.532
but somehow Christophe figured
it out, so you killed him.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.970
Then you took out the forger
to close the loop.

35:47.014 --> 35:50.148
If you lie to me, I'm going
to hand you over to him.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.153
I had no choice.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.851
Christophe said he'd go to
the cops if he didn't get a cut.

35:59.418 --> 36:02.290
Look, the Victorian's
worth a fortune.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.813
We can split it.

36:04.945 --> 36:06.294
No.

36:08.731 --> 36:11.604
[grunting]

36:13.083 --> 36:14.563
Stop.

36:14.607 --> 36:15.564
[Tracy panting]

36:15.608 --> 36:17.044
In here.

36:17.087 --> 36:19.481
[banging at door]

36:23.268 --> 36:24.443
[grunting]

36:24.486 --> 36:25.879
[gun fires]

36:45.115 --> 36:47.335
Tracy conned you, Chen.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.425
She got you to kill a good man.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.384
How's that feel?

36:53.428 --> 36:55.256
He came home early.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.737
It wasn't my fault.

37:00.827 --> 37:02.350
Really?

37:11.925 --> 37:13.840
[yells in pain]

37:13.883 --> 37:16.495
[groaning]

37:18.671 --> 37:20.542
You're late.

37:26.026 --> 37:29.377
Okay, Tracy. Time to talk.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.817
Apparently I was right.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.210
This thing's worth a mint.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.082
Turns out there's another
painting underneath it.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.699
There it is.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.527
Looks like an old master.

37:48.570 --> 37:51.138
Oh, look at you
with your art knowledge.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.314
And yeah, it's a Rembrandt.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.838
Guess the guy
who did the top layer

37:55.882 --> 37:58.014
thought he was just reusing
an old canvas.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.190
Had no idea he was painting
over a masterpiece.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.497
Tracy figured it out.Yeah.

38:02.541 --> 38:03.759
But unfortunately for her,

38:03.803 --> 38:05.195
Christophe Midi
got onto it, too.

38:05.239 --> 38:07.676
So she had to get
her hands dirty.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.461
Yeah. Once the bodies
started piling up,

38:09.504 --> 38:11.941
she knew you guys would need
someone to point the finger at.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.117
Well, good thing
I didn't fall for it.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.728
Not entirely.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.557
NEWSMAN:
This newly discovered Rembrandt

38:18.600 --> 38:22.082
has caused a sensation
in the art world.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.693
Plans are now in the works for
it to be permanently displayed

38:24.737 --> 38:26.739
at the Honolulu Museum of Art.

38:26.782 --> 38:29.959
The painting's owner,
the late Jack Candler,

38:30.003 --> 38:32.701
will be laid to rest
later today.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.355
You seen Higgins?

38:34.399 --> 38:37.097
She's been in the study
all morning.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.558
TC's two minutes out.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.910
Robin's always early, isn't he?

39:10.783 --> 39:15.788
I know it's not a...
a shandy, but...

39:17.529 --> 39:19.357
I thought maybe...

39:20.619 --> 39:23.535
Thank you, Magnum.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.628
To Jack.

39:29.671 --> 39:32.326
To Jack.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.505
[helicopter whirring
in distance]

39:42.118 --> 39:45.165
He's here.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.963
Lost your clip-on
tie, did you?

40:01.007 --> 40:02.530
Funny.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.185
Tell Robin I'll be
a few minutes.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.840
Sounds wildly optimistic.

40:11.365 --> 40:12.758
This is pathetic.

40:12.801 --> 40:13.933
Please go.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.370
Enough already. May I?

40:28.251 --> 40:29.949
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

40:29.992 --> 40:31.516
More than you know.

40:31.559 --> 40:33.953
Lovely.
That's a little tight.

40:33.996 --> 40:36.129
It's perfect.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.131
Touch it again, and you won't
get your lollipop.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.960
Now, come along.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.180
Leave it.
