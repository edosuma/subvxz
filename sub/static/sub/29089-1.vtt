00:42.176 --> 00:43.575
Angus.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.079
New meds should help the

00:50.785 --> 00:52.785
Well you know the score.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.786
Doctor Kumar is back next week
and I'll fill him in.

00:54.789 --> 00:55.788
Any more dizziness?

00:55.790 --> 00:58.090
Breathlessness, fainting?

00:58.793 --> 01:00.459
ANGUS: No.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.795
DOCTOR: No more driving.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.463
You live alone?

01:04.465 --> 01:07.166

with my daughter.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.801
DOCTOR: Excellent.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.469
Keep up the good fight, Angus.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.538

02:43.564 --> 02:46.465
How ya doing, Rosie?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.338
BARNEY: Granddad?

02:55.176 --> 02:57.026
Can I look?

02:57.027 --> 02:58.877
ANGUS: Yeah, as long as you stop
calling me granddad.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.283
BARNEY: Wow!

03:04.285 --> 03:05.584
Looks so close.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.919
ANGUS: Yeah.

03:06.921 --> 03:11.290
Like you can reach out
and touch it.

03:11.292 --> 03:15.394
People have been looking up
at the stars forever.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.297
And I think it's always
for the same reason.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.464
BARNEY: What?

03:19.466 --> 03:23.302
ANGUS: To see where we belong.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.504
That's a question I've been
asking myself

03:25.506 --> 03:27.639
my whole life.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.611
BARNEY: I wish I could be
an astronaut.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.846
ANGUS: You can.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.782
You can be anything you want.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.784
BARNEY: They only want
smart people.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.851
ANGUS: Well, you're smart.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.955
BARNEY: I got a D in math.

03:42.957 --> 03:47.359
ANGUS: Hey, I wasn't very
good at math myself.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.499
Rosie used to say,

03:54.501 --> 03:58.237
'on every special occasion,
you make a wish.'

03:58.872 --> 04:01.974
and that comet,

04:01.976 --> 04:04.409
that's a special occasion.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.945
BARNEY: Dad says wishes
don't come true.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.516
ANGUS: He does?

04:11.518 --> 04:12.918
Hmm.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.729
MOLLY: Finally got his telescope
out of the shed.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.269
JIM: That's good.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.672
MOLLY: Hey don't forget you have
homework tonight.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.290
Maybe Angus can help you out.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.907
BARNEY: Yeah, I'll finish it.
JIM: Wait, I can help him.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.678
MOLLY: Here, dad.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.684
JIM: Should you be drinking
that?

04:45.686 --> 04:47.286
Your heart.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.887
MOLLY: It's good for his heart,
enjoy dad!

TV VOICE (O.C.):
Tonight in our studio,

05:03.704 --> 05:06.405
We have the billionaire,
entrepreneur, Marcus Brown

05:06.407 --> 05:09.074
making a very special
announcement.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.844
JOURNALIST: Marcus.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.979
You've spoken about how your
father always supported

05:13.981 --> 05:16.048
your passion to go into space.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.350
MARCUS: Well, he always believed
everyone should have

05:18.352 --> 05:20.619
a chance to achieve
their dreams.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.054
JOURNALIST:
He died recently...

05:22.056 --> 05:24.890
MARCUS: And the Ventura
competition

05:24.892 --> 05:27.025
will honour his memory

05:27.027 --> 05:30.996
a lottery to choose someone who
dares to dream big.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.898
JOURNALIST: And the prize?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.533
MARCUS: A two-week journey
to space

05:34.535 --> 05:37.369
on the first commercial space
plane.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.505
We'll pull twelve names
from the lottery hat

05:40.507 --> 05:42.474
then the public votes
and for the winner.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.576
MARCUS: Who will join six other-
ANGUS: Turn it up!

05:45.446 --> 05:47.446
JOURNALIST: Are you ready?
MARCUS: We're ready.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.448
The competition is live now.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.617
So get your entry in before
midnight on Friday.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.986
Our March the 1st launch
is coming up fast.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.422
And I could be taking you.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.692
BARNEY: It's started!

06:03.097 --> 06:04.563
ANGUS: You know how many
runways there are

06:04.565 --> 06:06.365
that are that long in the whole
country?

06:06.367 --> 06:08.066
Maybe two or three.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.068
And they need that length
because

06:10.070 --> 06:12.104
this ship takes off like
an aeroplane

06:12.106 --> 06:14.806
and it's fuelled by
liquid hydrogen.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.511
Boy, they must have done some
serious reinforcement

06:19.513 --> 06:22.781
to that original runway.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.783
Got to have the right road.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.686
JOURNALIST: Some have said
you've taken risks

06:27.688 --> 06:30.555
in order to be the first
commercial space flight.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.991
MARCUS: Everything has an
element of risk.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.127
But, safety is our first
priority.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.895
Always.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.065
BARNEY: Angus, look that this.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.635
If you win, companies
pay you money.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.604
ANGUS: Look at that.

06:45.606 --> 06:49.441
Age requirement, eighteen
to sixty- five.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.578
BARNEY: You should sign up.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.647
ANGUS: Barney.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.815
It's a lottery.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.751
It's like winning a lottery.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.422
They need people who are fit
or in shape,

07:03.424 --> 07:04.956
you know, they don't want old.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.960
BARNEY: You could look
sixty-five.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.767
ANGUS: No, I couldn't.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.846
ENGINEER: Good night, Marcus.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.614
MARCUS: Have a good night.

(Tranquil Music)

08:15.896 --> 08:17.596
ANGUS (O.S): You stay here.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.498
You wait for mommy.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.601
BARNEY: Angus, don't forget
about the competition.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.237
Bye mom!

08:25.239 --> 08:26.771
MOLLY: Hey, the tutor-

08:26.773 --> 08:28.907
the money for the tutor.
ANGUS: Hey.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.842
MOLLY: Got it, okay.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.646
Thanks, dad.

08:36.216 --> 08:40.185
ANGUS: What was the name
of that doll you had

08:40.187 --> 08:42.787
god, you carried it everywhere,
that mom bought you?

08:42.789 --> 08:43.788
MOLLY: Patty.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.257
ANGUS: Patty, right.

08:45.259 --> 08:48.126
Because you had to pat her
before she burped.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.564
MOLLY: Dad, the realtor thinks
that we should lower

08:52.566 --> 08:55.634
the price on the house.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.769
ANGUS: Maybe I won't sell her.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.704
MOLLY: It's just all the debt
Mom got into.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.139
ANGUS: Aw she didn't know what
she was doing

09:01.141 --> 09:03.275
when she did that, she was not
in the right mind.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.143
MOLLY: What kind of company
sells a donkey sanctuary

09:05.145 --> 09:06.745
to a seventy-five year
old woman,

09:06.747 --> 09:09.948
with dementia?
ANGUS: A criminal one.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.717
MOLLY: Dad, we should talk about
selling that too.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.856
ANGUS: You know um,

09:17.858 --> 09:20.725
I'm gonna take the dog
for a walk alone.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.864
MOLLY: Do you have your phone
on you?

09:25.866 --> 09:28.700
ANGUS: You know,
I can still walk.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.072
(Door Slams)

09:46.954 --> 09:48.720
ANGUS: Freeze thaw, huh?

09:51.124 --> 09:54.693
The subsurface may have
some limestone.

09:54.695 --> 09:58.296
That's what's causing
all the cavings.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.665
You know these roads were only
meant to last

10:00.667 --> 10:02.233
about twenty years.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.302
ROAD CONSTRUCTION WORKER: Yah.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.439
JIM (O.S.): Listen, your father,

13:28.441 --> 13:30.175
he can stay here if he wants

13:30.177 --> 13:32.177
but remember how sick you got
with your mother.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.312
You never slept, you were
always anxious,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.181
you gave up on your
teacher's degree,

13:36.183 --> 13:37.849
your father couldn't cope.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.185
You were left doing it all.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.070
I'm not having you go through
that again.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.954
MOLLY (O.S): You mean, you don't
want to go through that again.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.357
Don't you dare try to shove my
father into a home.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.026
JIM: I'm not trying to shove him
in a home,

13:48.028 --> 13:49.494
he's said he didn't want
to be a burden.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.529
MOLLY: He's not there yet,
not even close.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.898
And when the time comes, it will
be my decision.

ANGUS: It was completely
conned.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.502
She saw this ad in
the newspaper,

34:32.504 --> 34:36.306
somehow she just bought
the donkey herd,

34:36.308 --> 34:38.408
the land, the whole thing.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.744
Thousands of dollars,

34:40.746 --> 34:42.245
put the whole thing on
a credit card

34:42.247 --> 34:43.680
so I didn't even know it
was happening

34:43.682 --> 34:45.348
until it was too late.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.319

your mother

34:49.321 --> 34:52.422
and the donkey herd.

things over

34:54.660 --> 34:57.561

next week.

It's a nice family, dad.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.781

sell the donkeys

ANGUS: No.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.884
Sold the house.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.385
And that is that.

35:22.387 --> 35:23.987
MOLLY: You've never even
visited them.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.588
ANGUS: You know, I think I'm
going to and lie down

35:25.591 --> 35:26.756

about your job?

36:25.217 --> 36:26.516
ANGUS: I like to fix things.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.285
BARNEY: What things did you fix?

36:28.287 --> 36:31.521
ANGUS: Um, well things that you
don't really think about.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.692
Like roads and runways.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.397
One time, there was this runway.

36:40.399 --> 36:44.701
That was built on a bed of
oolitic limestone.

36:44.703 --> 36:49.539
And water eroded a hole
in the limestone

36:49.541 --> 36:52.642
and that can happen when ground
water freezes.

36:52.644 --> 36:58.281
Then the pipe underneath
the runway, burst

36:58.283 --> 37:01.418
and the limestone dissolved

37:01.420 --> 37:04.888
this process is called Freeze
thaw shattering...

JIM: Agnus, it's not relevant.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.425
BARNEY: Dad it's interesting.
JIM: It's not relevant.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.559
ANGUS: It is relevant.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.262
A sinkhole in a runway?

37:12.264 --> 37:13.730
Kaboom.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.233
You got to have the right road.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.904

to win this trip?

37:28.914 --> 37:31.581

37:31.583 --> 37:33.383
I mean, always.

37:33.385 --> 37:37.654
I mean, since I was younger
than you.

37:39.458 --> 37:43.026
Just imagine, Barney,

37:43.028 --> 37:45.595
you go up into space,

37:45.597 --> 37:52.869
and you turn around
and there's earth

37:52.871 --> 37:54.537
Floating.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.507
Nothing's holding it up.

37:58.777 --> 38:03.647
And it's so magnificent

38:03.649 --> 38:09.719
and beautiful like a gorgeous
marble.

38:14.326 --> 38:18.495
How many people have that
opportunity?

38:18.497 --> 38:20.997
and why am I doing it now?

38:21.633 --> 38:24.501
Because I ain't gonna get
another opportunity

38:24.503 --> 38:28.305
and I'd be a damn fool to let
one this pass.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.924
of our most mature contestant.

48:47.926 --> 48:50.310
ANGUS: May I ask,

48:50.311 --> 48:52.695
does your spacecraft weigh
1600 tons?

48:52.697 --> 48:54.397
MARCUS: It weighs exactly that.

48:54.399 --> 48:56.565
ANGUS: And is that exact, exact?

48:56.567 --> 48:58.968
MARCUS: It is precisely exact,
yes.

48:58.970 --> 49:01.070
ANGUS: That's a lot of weight.
MARCUS: Indeed it is.

49:01.072 --> 49:02.271
ANGUS: How does that work
underground?

49:02.273 --> 49:03.673
MARCUS: Hmm?

49:03.675 --> 49:06.042
ANGUS: How much limestone
is there left

49:06.044 --> 49:07.744
under the runway?

49:07.745 --> 49:09.445
BILL: You can rest assure that
it's mostly sandstone under-

49:09.447 --> 49:11.247
MARCUS: We have the top
engineers working

49:11.249 --> 49:12.448
on the project.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.483
And our winner will be
in safe hands.

49:14.485 --> 49:16.385
Don't you worry.

49:16.387 --> 49:20.356
ANGUS: Provided that they check
with the stress loading

49:20.358 --> 49:21.724
on the runway.

49:21.726 --> 49:25.261
With the all-up configuration.

49:25.263 --> 49:28.264
MARCUS: Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

49:28.266 --> 49:30.099
At least it's good to know.

49:30.101 --> 49:32.268
We'll pass your concerns along
to our people.

49:32.270 --> 49:33.502
Thanks again.

49:35.273 --> 49:36.672
ELISA: Good luck, Angus.

49:41.612 --> 49:43.279
ELISA: Have we fixed
the hydrogen line?

49:43.281 --> 49:44.513
BILL: We're almost there.

49:46.150 --> 49:49.118
ELISA: You know what, I like
him, Angus Stewart.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.686
BILL: He looks a hundred.

49:50.688 --> 49:53.089
ELISA: He could be a favourite.

49:53.091 --> 49:54.657
BILL: Let's hope not.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.361
JIM: Did it start yet?

49:58.363 --> 50:00.663
Is he doing okay?

50:00.665 --> 50:02.365
Let's go Angus.

50:03.167 --> 50:04.333
CONNOR: If I was chosen?

50:07.105 --> 50:09.438
I'd start a scholarship
fund.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.740
Yeah.

50:10.742 --> 50:12.308
For the underprivileged.

50:12.310 --> 50:14.076
Because not everybody
gets a chance

50:14.078 --> 50:16.178
to achieve their dreams.

50:16.179 --> 50:18.279
And that's what this trip
is all about that.

50:18.282 --> 50:23.119
A once in a life chance
to dream big.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.655
INTERVIEWER: Well done.

50:26.657 --> 50:28.124
CONNOR:: Thank you.

50:29.327 --> 50:32.194
DIRECTOR (O.S): Angus Stewart,
you're next.

50:35.333 --> 50:36.665
CONNOR: Over to you.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.701
ANGUS (Laughs): Yeah.

50:40.338 --> 50:42.671
INTERVIEWER: So, our last
contestant

50:42.673 --> 50:44.473
is Angus Stewart.

50:44.475 --> 50:46.342
Hello Angus.

50:46.344 --> 50:50.579
Angus, you are our oldest
contestant.

50:50.581 --> 50:54.483
You may be the first civilian
grandpa in space.

50:54.485 --> 50:57.553
How does it feel to be
in with a chance

50:57.555 --> 50:59.155
for the trip of a lifetime.

51:00.792 --> 51:02.558
ANGUS: Um.

51:03.594 --> 51:07.229
Providing that the 'experts'
have done

51:07.231 --> 51:10.232
their job properly,

51:10.234 --> 51:15.471
and the geologists have checked
out this area properly.

51:15.473 --> 51:17.706
And uh-

51:17.708 --> 51:22.378
providing that the um-

51:22.380 --> 51:24.313
BARNEY: He's too tense!

51:24.315 --> 51:26.482
JIM: He looks a little drunk.

51:26.484 --> 51:30.152
ANGUS: -runway itself has
sufficiently reinforced...

51:30.154 --> 51:32.321
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
ANGUS: So that

51:32.323 --> 51:38.494
there's not a great deal of um-

51:38.496 --> 51:40.729
Ero- ero- eroding.

51:40.731 --> 51:42.131
INTERVIEWER: Right, yes,

51:42.133 --> 51:43.833
so, Angus.

51:43.835 --> 51:45.768
You were a civil engineer,

51:45.770 --> 51:48.804
clearly you knew a lot of stuff.

51:48.806 --> 51:50.673
Tell us why you should
be chosen?

51:50.675 --> 51:52.708
Why do you want to go?

51:52.709 --> 51:54.742
There are hundreds of thousands
of people out there right now

51:54.745 --> 51:56.745
wishing they were sitting
where you are.

51:56.747 --> 51:58.380
(Angus Mumbles)

51:58.382 --> 52:00.850
INTERVIEWER: So, why should
the public vote for you?

52:00.852 --> 52:03.352
What makes you that special?

52:04.222 --> 52:05.521
ANGUS: Um.

52:09.260 --> 52:11.694
I always wanted to be an
astronaut.

52:12.463 --> 52:15.831
INTERVIEWER: Yes, and?
ANGUS: I...

52:16.434 --> 52:17.666
Um...

52:20.538 --> 52:23.472
JIM: Damn, he's excited,
I think he froze up.

52:26.144 --> 52:27.910
BARNEY: No, no, no.

52:28.746 --> 52:30.579
(Angus Mumbles)

52:46.164 --> 52:48.731
BARNEY: C'mon Angus,
say something.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.800
(Tense Music)

52:52.803 --> 52:54.570
INTERVIEWER: What should I do?

53:10.488 --> 53:11.820
BARNEY: Oh no.
JIM: Is he okay?

53:11.822 --> 53:13.355
Is he okay?

53:13.357 --> 53:15.624
God, I knew this was a bad idea.

53:17.929 --> 53:19.428
(Tense Music Continues)

53:21.499 --> 53:23.365
BILL: At least he's shut up.

53:24.368 --> 53:25.834
MARCUS: Get him out of there.

53:36.681 --> 53:38.514
MOLLY: Was it a TIA?

53:38.516 --> 53:39.848
NURSE: Yes, it was.

53:39.850 --> 53:42.718
And he's going to need
a lot of rest.

53:44.689 --> 53:47.389
MOLLY: I can't believe you put
him into that competition.

53:47.391 --> 53:49.141
BARNEY: He wanted to go.

53:49.142 --> 53:50.892
MOLLY: How did he even
get picked?

53:50.895 --> 53:54.263
JIM: His name came up.

53:54.265 --> 53:55.498
We fudged his birth date.

53:55.499 --> 53:56.732
MOLLY: You lied?
BARNEY: It wasn't Dad's fault.

53:56.734 --> 53:57.866
JIM: I was trying to help him.

53:57.868 --> 53:59.268
MOLLY: How could they even
consider

53:59.270 --> 54:00.553
a frail man like that?

54:00.554 --> 54:01.837
BARNEY: The comet would have
made him all better!

54:01.839 --> 54:03.539
It can fix things.
MOLLY: Barney.

54:03.541 --> 54:05.674
It's just a frozen rock made
of ice and dust.

54:05.676 --> 54:06.976
It can't fix anything.

54:06.978 --> 54:08.427
MOLLY: Dad?

54:08.428 --> 54:09.877
ANGUS: I have to go back.
MOLLY: Dad, no.

54:09.880 --> 54:11.547
Dad, it's over.
ANGUS: It's not safe!

54:11.549 --> 54:12.915
MOLLY: That's right,
it's not safe.

54:12.916 --> 54:14.282
ANGUS: No, no, no, Molly
you don't understand.

54:14.285 --> 54:15.768
MOLLY: No, I do understand.

54:15.769 --> 54:17.252
You had a dream to go up
and now it's over.

54:17.255 --> 54:18.887
ANGUS: The runway is not-
MOLLY: You're too old.

54:18.889 --> 54:21.557
NURSE: Alright, folks, I'd like
to ask you all to leave.

54:21.559 --> 54:23.259
Angus, let's get you
back in bed.

54:23.261 --> 54:25.527
There we go, cmon, let's have
a lie down here.

54:25.529 --> 54:26.829
Your dad has to relax.

54:26.831 --> 54:28.864
Cmon, goodnight everyone.

54:28.866 --> 54:30.766
BARNEY: I don't want to go,
I want to stay with him.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.368
MOLLY: No you're going home.

54:56.927 --> 54:58.627
MOLLY: Why didn't you tell me?

55:00.765 --> 55:01.930
JIM: Robert

55:08.572 --> 55:11.774
told me to execute
a dodgy trade.

55:14.478 --> 55:17.613
Everybody in banking bends
the rules.

55:17.615 --> 55:19.682
MOLLY: I don't care about
everybody.

55:27.825 --> 55:30.059
JIM: I screwed up, Mol.

55:33.631 --> 55:38.000
(Mellow Piano Music)

56:23.581 --> 56:25.748
MOLLY: May 2nd 1972.

56:27.385 --> 56:30.018
Mr. Stewart.

56:30.020 --> 56:33.422
Thank you for your application
to be a mission specialist

56:33.424 --> 56:35.924
on the space shuttle.

56:35.926 --> 56:37.960
Unfortunately you have not
been selected

56:37.962 --> 56:43.932
in your bid to become an
astronaut on this occasion.

56:52.710 --> 56:55.010
(Knocking)

56:56.881 --> 56:58.680
ELISA: Hey Angus,

57:04.054 --> 57:06.021
I wanted to come and see you.

57:06.023 --> 57:07.790
Tell you in person.

57:21.439 --> 57:23.105
It was a medical concern.

57:34.084 --> 57:38.554
You know when I was young,
I wanted to marry,

57:38.556 --> 57:41.790
have four children,
live in a castle.

57:43.227 --> 57:46.628
Oh, and of course,
I wanted to go to space.

57:46.630 --> 57:50.766
That was the last wish
on my list.

57:50.768 --> 57:53.001
I suppose one out of four
ain't bad.

57:56.774 --> 57:59.074
You have a lovely family, Angus.

58:07.117 --> 58:12.955
Anyway, the vote's in,
they chose the boy.

58:12.957 --> 58:15.190
ANGUS: I know, I figured.

58:17.795 --> 58:19.027
ELISA: Okay.

58:23.667 --> 58:28.136
And Angus, it's best to not say
anything to the press.

58:28.138 --> 58:29.738
Leave it up to us.

It's okay.

1:01:26.984 --> 1:01:29.151
ANGUS: Sit down.

1:01:44.101 --> 1:01:47.202
You know, your mother wanted
to go to space too.

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:51.073
You remember that?

1:01:55.279 --> 1:01:58.180
I was a shared thing.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:11.426
One day, I decided to remind her
of the day we first met.

1:02:11.428 --> 1:02:14.996
And I just hoped that it was

1:02:14.998 --> 1:02:17.933
a day that she would remember
who I was.

1:02:19.803 --> 1:02:25.474
And she did, and she smiled.

1:02:35.385 --> 1:02:41.056
I didn't call you on the day
she died.

1:02:41.058 --> 1:02:44.392
Because I was too busy
losing her.

1:02:52.936 --> 1:02:55.904
A life well lived,

1:02:58.075 --> 1:03:00.242
is long enough.

lived daddy?

when he went into that
space interview.

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:14.149
I mean I was worried sick but

1:04:14.151 --> 1:04:15.851
He looked so happy.

1:04:17.154 --> 1:04:19.805
MOLLY: Well, you know, take-off

1:04:19.806 --> 1:04:22.457
probably would have killed him
anyway.

on target

a passenger

wonderful opportunity

ANGUS: The paper that
you're looking for

1:06:06.997 --> 1:06:08.496
should have a title, like,

Limestone in reference

ANGUS: All right um-

1:06:19.476 --> 1:06:20.575
Just look for the maps.

1:06:24.414 --> 1:06:28.249
Ooh, maps, there's
a lot of maps.

1:06:28.251 --> 1:06:30.051

in there that says

1:06:30.053 --> 1:06:33.755
Solid drift map for the
Springfield area.

Springfield.

BARNEY: Oh, I think I found it.

1:06:49.139 --> 1:06:52.073

the old airfield

1:06:52.075 --> 1:06:54.275
where the new space center is?

1:06:54.277 --> 1:06:56.277

1:06:56.279 --> 1:06:58.279
curving squiggly lines?

1:06:58.281 --> 1:07:00.448
Are there any near the space
station?

1:07:00.450 --> 1:07:02.150
BARNEY: Yeah, there a ton.

1:07:02.152 --> 1:07:04.419
ANGUS: Alright there's an index
at the side of the map.

1:07:04.421 --> 1:07:06.287
Look down the list,

1:07:06.289 --> 1:07:09.591
it's going to tell you
everything that's there.

1:07:11.161 --> 1:07:13.228
BARNEY: Oh, it says...

1:07:13.229 --> 1:07:15.296
Two separate oolite beds have
been identified

1:07:15.298 --> 1:07:16.765
in the study area.

1:07:19.202 --> 1:07:20.769
There's oolite!

1:07:20.771 --> 1:07:22.170
There's definitely oolite.

1:07:22.172 --> 1:07:25.440
ANGUS: Okay, we got
to tell them.

1:07:26.309 --> 1:07:28.076
BARNEY: Hello?

1:07:33.316 --> 1:07:35.717
Was just looking for Oolite.

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.226
(Tense Music)

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:51.566
ANGUS: Ha!

1:07:54.337 --> 1:07:56.104
Exhibit A.

1:08:15.559 --> 1:08:19.360
Erosion in Oolitic Limestone

1:08:19.362 --> 1:08:21.696
with reference to Civil
Engineering.

1:08:21.698 --> 1:08:23.465
Thank you very much.

1:08:26.236 --> 1:08:27.702
ANGUS (On Phone): Then the pipe

1:08:27.704 --> 1:08:31.506
underneath the runway, burst.

1:08:31.508 --> 1:08:34.542
And the limestone dissolved.

1:08:35.378 --> 1:08:37.345
BARNEY: It's live.

1:08:41.551 --> 1:08:44.385
JOE: Are you going to see
the donkeys?

1:08:44.387 --> 1:08:48.490
ANGUS: Uh, you wanna come?

1:08:48.492 --> 1:08:49.858
JOE: I can't.

1:08:52.896 --> 1:08:56.464
(Orchestral Music)

1:09:34.938 --> 1:09:40.208
ANGUS: Then the pipe underneath
the runway, burst.

1:09:40.210 --> 1:09:43.311
And the limestone dissolved.

1:09:44.881 --> 1:09:48.650
BILL: First of all, the hydrogen
refueling line has been fixed.

1:09:48.652 --> 1:09:50.518
and if there is Oolite
it is so far down

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.153
it doesn't matter.

1:09:52.154 --> 1:09:53.787
Anyway the line is running
through layer of sandstone.

1:09:53.790 --> 1:09:56.391
We did a comprehensive
ground survey.

1:09:57.794 --> 1:09:59.227
BARNEY: My granddad
thinks something

1:09:59.229 --> 1:10:01.462
is wrong with the Ventura
runway.

1:10:01.464 --> 1:10:02.697
And I believe him.

1:10:02.699 --> 1:10:04.732
And everybody else should too.

1:10:05.802 --> 1:10:08.203
MARCUS: The last thing we need
is some old man

1:10:08.205 --> 1:10:10.738
sowing doubt three days
before lift off.

1:10:14.477 --> 1:10:16.878
BILL: No one's going to
listen to him.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:19.480
ELISA: What if he's right?

1:10:20.817 --> 1:10:23.885
(Knocking)
NURSE: Angus?

1:10:36.499 --> 1:10:37.832
MOLLY: So, what did the firm's
lawyer say?

1:10:37.834 --> 1:10:39.367
What happens next?

1:10:39.369 --> 1:10:40.902
JIM: Basically, I get two
meetings with the lawyer

1:10:40.904 --> 1:10:43.938
and then I'm on my own.

1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:46.341
I don't have a hope, they're
going to bury me.

1:10:46.343 --> 1:10:47.809
(Phone Rings)

1:10:49.646 --> 1:10:50.445
MOLLY: Hello?

1:10:54.517 --> 1:10:55.750
Oh my God.

1:10:57.287 --> 1:10:58.519
I'm on my way.

1:10:58.521 --> 1:11:00.388
It's dad.
JIM: What's going on?

1:11:02.459 --> 1:11:03.825
(Radio Voice)

1:11:03.827 --> 1:11:05.460
BARNEY: Can we hurry please?

1:11:13.470 --> 1:11:14.802
BARNEY: Angus!

1:11:15.372 --> 1:11:16.604
JIM: Where did you get that?

1:11:16.606 --> 1:11:17.972
JOE: A friend.

1:11:20.877 --> 1:11:22.644
LIZ: I am so sorry.

1:11:22.645 --> 1:11:24.412
We were hoping to find him
before you arrived,

1:11:24.414 --> 1:11:25.680
he could not have gone far.

1:11:25.682 --> 1:11:26.714
MOLLY: You lost him?

1:11:26.716 --> 1:11:28.132
NURSE: Not lost, misplaced.

1:11:28.133 --> 1:11:29.549
JIM: What the hell kind
of a place is this?

1:11:29.552 --> 1:11:31.286
BARNEY: A pretty crappy one.

1:11:31.287 --> 1:11:33.021
LIZ: Angus did cause some chaos
with the residents.

1:11:33.023 --> 1:11:34.689
NURSE: Yes, but what he
actually did do...

1:11:34.691 --> 1:11:37.859
LIZ: And he lied his way through
a national competition.

1:11:37.861 --> 1:11:39.327
BARNEY: He's gone to tell them.

1:11:39.329 --> 1:11:40.561
JIM: Tell who what?

1:11:40.563 --> 1:11:42.430
BARNEY: Marcus, the runway,
oolite.

1:11:42.432 --> 1:11:43.564
JIM: Enough with the oolite!

1:11:43.566 --> 1:11:45.433
MOLLY: Oh my God.
BARNEY: Angus knows!

1:11:45.435 --> 1:11:47.335
The Ventura is in trouble,
we need to help him.

1:11:47.337 --> 1:11:48.569
JIM: Barney!

1:11:48.571 --> 1:11:50.872
(Coughing)

1:11:54.077 --> 1:11:54.976
BARNEY: Angus!

1:11:54.978 --> 1:11:56.577
JIM: Angus!

1:11:56.579 --> 1:11:57.729
JIM & BARNEY: There he is.

1:11:57.730 --> 1:11:58.880
BARNEY: There he is,
there he is.

1:12:02.085 --> 1:12:03.751
JIM: Angus, stop!

1:12:03.753 --> 1:12:06.020
MOLLY: Dad, stop, get in.

1:12:08.725 --> 1:12:10.024
BARNEY: I'm going with you.

1:12:10.026 --> 1:12:11.459
ANGUS: We just have
to stop them.

1:12:11.461 --> 1:12:12.960
JIM: Okay, stop this, okay?

1:12:12.962 --> 1:12:13.928
Just stop!

1:12:13.930 --> 1:12:15.463
What if you're wrong?

1:12:15.465 --> 1:12:16.931
This is a massive company.

1:12:16.933 --> 1:12:18.933
They would have done survey
after survey, test after test.

1:12:18.935 --> 1:12:20.819
This used to be a runway
for Christ sake!

1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:22.704
ANGUS: Do you have any idea how
many roads I've built?

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:24.939
I'm telling you this
is not right.

1:12:24.941 --> 1:12:26.874
MOLLY: Dad, are you
absolutely sure

1:12:26.876 --> 1:12:28.943
that there is oolite
in the region?

1:12:28.945 --> 1:12:30.812
That there is oolite under
the runway?

1:12:30.814 --> 1:12:32.780
JIM: You're gonna have to give
me more than just a hunch.

1:12:32.782 --> 1:12:35.950
Give me one example of such
an implausible scenario.

1:12:35.952 --> 1:12:37.118
ANGUS: Tell them about
the Titanic.

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:39.487
JIM: It hit an iceberg.

1:12:39.488 --> 1:12:41.855
ANGUS: It was an unsinkable
ship and it sunk.

1:12:41.858 --> 1:12:43.591
The Challenger?

1:12:43.593 --> 1:12:44.959
JIM: That was a freak accident.

1:12:44.961 --> 1:12:46.961
ANGUS: No it wasn't,
the O Rings.

1:12:46.963 --> 1:12:49.831
They knew before they went up
that there was a problem.

1:12:49.833 --> 1:12:52.533
BARNEY: Dad, if Angus thinks
something is wrong it is!

1:12:52.535 --> 1:12:53.634
MOLLY: Okay, everybody shut up!

1:12:53.636 --> 1:12:54.869
Shut up!

1:12:56.139 --> 1:12:59.507
Right now, what we need to do
is go and tell them

1:12:59.509 --> 1:13:01.976
that Angus knows that something,
alright?

1:13:02.979 --> 1:13:05.113
Get in the car!

1:13:05.115 --> 1:13:07.048
Now!

1:13:10.453 --> 1:13:12.553
MOLLY (O.S): Good luck dad,
cmon, let's go.

1:13:14.457 --> 1:13:15.523
BARNEY: He's come to visit.

1:13:15.525 --> 1:13:16.591
SECURITY GUARD: Has he?

1:13:16.593 --> 1:13:17.959
Does he have a pass?

1:13:19.662 --> 1:13:21.129
MOLLY: There it is.

1:13:22.665 --> 1:13:24.899
SECURITY GUARD: I recognize you.

1:13:24.901 --> 1:13:26.534
You're the one who's posted
that video?

1:13:26.536 --> 1:13:28.002
About the runway, right?

1:13:28.004 --> 1:13:29.604
BARNEY: I posted it.

1:13:29.606 --> 1:13:31.172
SECURITY GUARD:
It was interesting.

1:13:31.174 --> 1:13:34.041
No visitors after hours.

1:13:34.043 --> 1:13:36.444
JIM: Hey, listen.

1:13:36.446 --> 1:13:38.062
I worked at a bank.

1:13:38.063 --> 1:13:39.679
At the millennium we had
to call in

1:13:39.682 --> 1:13:41.649
all the old guys out of
retirement just in case

1:13:41.651 --> 1:13:43.451
there was a bug that we didn't
know how to fix.

1:13:43.453 --> 1:13:44.685
MOLLY: That's true, he was there
for weeks.

1:13:44.687 --> 1:13:46.020
SECURITY GUARD:
Oh yeah, I remember that,

1:13:46.022 --> 1:13:48.556
In case the computers crashed,
or something right?

1:13:48.558 --> 1:13:49.690
JIM: Yeah.

1:13:49.692 --> 1:13:50.925
SECURITY GUARD: I can't let
you in.

1:13:50.927 --> 1:13:53.494
ANGUS: Excuse me.

1:13:53.496 --> 1:13:55.630
This is oolite.

1:13:55.632 --> 1:13:56.798
It's a very light weight mineral

1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.699
It's found all over this area.

1:13:58.701 --> 1:14:02.904
Now the space plane,
weighs hundreds of tons

1:14:02.906 --> 1:14:07.041
And I don't think the runway
is stable enough to take it.

1:14:07.043 --> 1:14:09.043
MOLLY: My dad knows everything
about roads.

1:14:09.045 --> 1:14:10.812
BARNEY: And runways.

1:14:10.814 --> 1:14:12.713
ANGUS: Do you remember
the O rings?

1:14:12.715 --> 1:14:13.948
JIM: The Titanic?

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:17.718
SECURITY GUARD: Yes,
it hit an iceberg.

1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:21.923
JIM: The unsinkable ship sunk.

1:14:21.925 --> 1:14:25.560
Now imagine if you could help
this man potentially avert

1:14:25.562 --> 1:14:27.895
a potential catastrophe.

1:14:27.897 --> 1:14:32.733
If you could help him stop it,

1:14:32.735 --> 1:14:34.569
and you didn't.

1:14:34.571 --> 1:14:36.604
BARNEY: People could die.

1:14:44.747 --> 1:14:46.080
SECURITY GUARD: Okay.

1:14:46.082 --> 1:14:48.216
You, only you.

1:14:49.853 --> 1:14:51.619
(Gate Buzzes)
ANGUS: Thank you very much.

1:14:51.621 --> 1:14:52.920
SECURITY GUARD: In you go.
MOLLY: Good luck dad!

1:14:52.922 --> 1:14:54.622
JIM: Go get 'em Angus.

1:14:54.624 --> 1:14:56.624
MOLLY: Bye Dad,
we're right here.

1:14:58.561 --> 1:14:59.961
ANGUS: Excuse me.

1:15:00.763 --> 1:15:02.763
Excuse me, could you tell me-

1:15:03.099 --> 1:15:04.866
Excuse me, I'm looking-

1:15:05.935 --> 1:15:08.569
Could you tell me where Marcus
Brown's office is?

1:15:08.571 --> 1:15:10.505
MAN: Are you suppose to be here?
ANGUS: Uh...

1:15:10.773 --> 1:15:12.907
MAN: Sir?
ANGUS: I'll be right with you.

1:15:13.276 --> 1:15:16.010
I'm looking for Mr. Brown's
office, Macus Brown.

1:15:16.012 --> 1:15:18.980
MAN: Sir.
ANGUS: You know, oh jeez.

1:15:24.787 --> 1:15:26.020
BILL: Oh dear god.
ELISA: Angus.

1:15:26.022 --> 1:15:28.789
ANGUS: There is oolite
underneath the runway.

1:15:28.791 --> 1:15:34.795
The hydrogen line has leaked
and it is not safe.

1:15:34.797 --> 1:15:36.964
BILL: And you are the expert
who found the flaw

1:15:36.966 --> 1:15:37.965
that nobody else did.

1:15:37.967 --> 1:15:40.034
ANGUS: That's exactly who I am.

1:15:41.804 --> 1:15:44.005
MARCUS: We have several
hundred engineers

1:15:44.007 --> 1:15:45.806
who have been working
on this site.

1:15:45.808 --> 1:15:48.209
ANGUS: 'Safety is our first
priority,' right?

1:15:48.211 --> 1:15:51.012
ELISA: Angus, this base
revitalized

1:15:51.014 --> 1:15:52.146
this community.

1:15:52.148 --> 1:15:54.015
These things matter to Marcus.

1:15:54.017 --> 1:15:56.117
ANGUS: I know that you have
acquired this site

1:15:56.119 --> 1:16:00.154
because the runway is basically
prepped and in situ.

1:16:00.156 --> 1:16:03.658
And I know you cut corners
because you needed to be

1:16:03.660 --> 1:16:06.761
the first commercial space
craft, no matter what.

1:16:07.163 --> 1:16:10.998
It takes one small thing,
and you know this

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.834
that is overlooked in the rush
to success,

1:16:13.836 --> 1:16:15.836
that one small thing will cause
a disaster.

1:16:15.838 --> 1:16:17.338
BILL: Oh dear God.

1:16:17.339 --> 1:16:18.839
ANGUS: The vacuum pipe
surrounding the spaceship's

1:16:18.841 --> 1:16:21.943
hydrogen line has not been
sealed properly.

1:16:21.945 --> 1:16:23.010
BILL: We fixed it.

1:16:23.012 --> 1:16:27.114
ANGUS: The hydrogen leaked

1:16:27.116 --> 1:16:29.850
and it froze the surrounding
ground water.

1:16:29.852 --> 1:16:32.253
What happened to the porous
limestone underneath?

1:16:32.255 --> 1:16:34.305
BILL: We re-enforced the runway.

1:16:34.306 --> 1:16:36.356
ANGUS: But did you account for
the all up configuration?

1:16:36.359 --> 1:16:38.793
The weight of the ship
and the passengers?

1:16:38.795 --> 1:16:40.928
and if you're off by even one
kilogram

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:43.664
the ice can press on the
limestone underneath.

1:16:43.666 --> 1:16:44.932
Enlarge the cracks.

1:16:44.934 --> 1:16:47.535
Resulting...

1:16:47.536 --> 1:16:50.137
In a hole so big that will
swallow the entire spacecraft

1:16:50.139 --> 1:16:51.672
and all the passengers in it!

1:16:51.674 --> 1:16:54.875
ELISA: Okay, listen, if there
is a problem.

1:16:54.877 --> 1:16:57.378
And it is as you say it is?

1:16:57.380 --> 1:16:59.213
How do you suggest we fix it?
BILL: Oh come on.

1:16:59.215 --> 1:17:01.015
He's been retired for
twenty years.

1:17:01.017 --> 1:17:02.383
We can't go listening to
everybody

1:17:02.385 --> 1:17:03.751
who has an opinion.
ELISA: Bill-

1:17:03.753 --> 1:17:05.853
ANGUS: Listen to me.

1:17:05.855 --> 1:17:07.221
If you move the hydrogen lines

1:17:07.223 --> 1:17:08.756
to the other end of the runway.

1:17:08.758 --> 1:17:11.892
Where the assembly area
is that may work.

1:17:11.894 --> 1:17:14.395
and then all you have to do
is re-lay the runway.

BILL: Yeah, that's all.

1:17:16.165 --> 1:17:17.932
Do you have any idea how much
that's going to cost?

1:17:17.934 --> 1:17:20.301
ANGUS: Yeah, well then
just take the chance

1:17:20.303 --> 1:17:23.004
and create the sinkhole

1:17:23.006 --> 1:17:25.272
and let the Ventura project sink
with it.

1:17:27.243 --> 1:17:31.412
MARCUS: My father said that this
mission couldn't work.

1:17:31.414 --> 1:17:34.248
I spent twenty five years
of my life

1:17:34.250 --> 1:17:38.919
trying to convince him and
everyone else that it could.

1:17:38.921 --> 1:17:40.921
And now we're here.

1:17:40.923 --> 1:17:45.793
From now on, our boundaries
are limitless.

1:17:45.795 --> 1:17:47.962
Every human could eventually
have the chance

1:17:47.964 --> 1:17:50.931
to see our place in the universe
from space.

1:17:50.933 --> 1:17:53.934
And that's just the beginning.

1:17:53.936 --> 1:17:56.937
I believe we were meant
to explore

1:17:56.939 --> 1:17:59.040
and we are going to do it.

with you sir.

1:18:03.279 --> 1:18:06.447
I just want it to start
correctly.

on schedule.

1:18:09.118 --> 1:18:11.185

1:19:04.173 --> 1:19:05.973

1:19:05.975 --> 1:19:08.943
I don't know if they heard me,
but I told them.

1:19:10.012 --> 1:19:13.914

1:19:14.150 --> 1:19:18.185

the millennium bug panic?

1:21:53.342 --> 1:21:56.510
Those old computer guys

1:21:56.512 --> 1:21:59.680
they were the only ones who knew
how to fix the things.

1:22:02.184 --> 1:22:05.219
Marcus, your father believed
in your dreams,

1:22:05.521 --> 1:22:10.991
but I think, he just wanted to
make sure you did it right.

1:22:23.205 --> 1:22:25.272
MARCUS: Call the press.

Let's play a game, shall we?

I might find you here.

the mission.

statement.

The reasons why you wanted
to go.

1:23:57.433 --> 1:23:59.500
I said the same thing to my dad.
