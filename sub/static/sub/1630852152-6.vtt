WEBVTT

00:08.426 --> 00:09.218
What do you remember, exactly?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.723
It's all fragments.
The images come and go.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.015
How long has this been going on?

00:15.057 --> 00:17.059
Since that night,
but now it won't stop.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.398
You can't trust your mind.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.233
My mind's all I have, Mari.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.446
You know you're incapable
of killing anyone.

00:29.238 --> 00:30.489
How can you be so sure?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.159
Give me one good reason why.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.870
Anything to make me understand

00:35.911 --> 00:38.414
that all of this makes sense
outside your own head.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.582
I don't get it. It
doesn't make sense.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.169
I killed Assaf.
How can I make you understand?

00:43.210 --> 00:45.546
Nobody killed Assaf, Fefe!

00:45.588 --> 00:47.882
I checked his body, I told you!

00:51.010 --> 00:52.428
They found him.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.348
What?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.601
It was in a newspaper
in Tayrona yesterday.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.938
They said it was a homicide.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.204
It's only a matter of time until they
link me to that shit, Mari.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.499
I'll go to jail.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.126
That won't happen.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.169
- Yes, it will.
- It won't.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.379
Félix, we're in Colombia,
please.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.925
It took them ten months
to find the body.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.344
But they found it.
They found it!

01:33.385 --> 01:38.182
Yes, but there's probably some poor rookie
on minimum wage in charge of the case.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.019
Crimes just don't get
solved here.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.358
Félix,

01:48.442 --> 01:49.693
listen to me.

01:51.529 --> 01:52.530
It'll all be okay.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.701
What happened in Tayrona
is in the past.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.832
It'll all be okay.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.801
KANNALAB CREATED IN BOGOTÁ?

02:13.843 --> 02:16.053
SEED STOLEN FROM TAYRONA?

02:16.095 --> 02:18.347
BOUGHT FROM THE MAFIA

02:18.389 --> 02:20.850
MARCH 8. MARIANA'S BIRTHDAY.
ORIGIN OF KANNALAB. LIE?

02:20.891 --> 02:23.394
ISRAELIS?

04:18.634 --> 04:22.388
BODY OF ISRAELI ASSAF BEN AMIR,
FOUND AT TAYRONA

04:31.855 --> 04:32.690
Hey, Susana.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.067
<i>We have a problem.</i>

04:35.109 --> 04:35.943
What happened?

04:40.489 --> 04:41.824
We've just been robbed.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.303
Do you know what time it is?

05:03.345 --> 05:06.348
<i>Someone</i> <i>stole</i> <i>a</i> <i>cannabis</i> <i>mother</i> <i>plant
from</i> <i>the</i> <i>greenhouse.</i>

05:06.390 --> 05:08.434
<i>We're on our way. See you there?</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:10.394
We have to call the cops.

05:10.436 --> 05:14.148
The cops will take three days to show
up. No. We have to find the thief now.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.190
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

06:36.647 --> 06:37.940
<i>Mari,</i>

06:37.981 --> 06:40.359
<i>I've arrived at the airport
to pick you up.</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:42.069
<i>What airline did you fly on?</i>

06:43.153 --> 06:44.905
<i>Let me know as soon as you can.</i>

06:57.918 --> 06:58.919
I don't drink coffee.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.754
It's chamomile tea.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.923
Thanks.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.175
Our doll face hasn't shown up.

07:05.217 --> 07:05.843
He's asleep in the car.

07:07.678 --> 07:13.350
- Asleep? You sure wore him out.
- Look, I have to tell you something.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.852
You're carrying Felix's baby?

07:16.186 --> 07:17.020
What?

07:20.315 --> 07:21.150
What happened?

07:22.359 --> 07:23.902
They found Assaf's body.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.574
- What? Who?
- The police.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.118
It was on the news.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.955
And they said it was a homicide.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.126
But... What do you
mean a homicide?

07:39.168 --> 07:42.504
- You said he died naturally.
- I'm not a CSI! I don't know!

07:42.546 --> 07:43.922
I've never seen a corpse.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.716
What the fuck do we do now?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.636
What we've been doing since
then. We go on with our lives.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.307
The hell you talking about?
This changes everything.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.685
Then who killed him?

07:56.727 --> 07:58.353
I dunno. I can't think
about it now.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.230
How can we not think
about it now?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.107
Thank God you're here.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.735
What happened to your hand?

08:04.776 --> 08:07.321
I was trimming the plants
when the lights went out.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.448
They were out for
almost 20 minutes.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.909
This is pure
corporate espionage.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.203
We have to search everyone,
Susana.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.413
- And we'll stop production?
- No. No way.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.707
We're against the clock
to make Ilana's delivery.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.334
You really don't get it, huh?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.585
I don't get it?

08:21.627 --> 08:24.213
Please, enlighten me
with your endless wisdom.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.757
If this mother plant gets out,
they'll copy its genetics

08:26.798 --> 08:28.634
and we'll be worthless.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.721
And if we stop, we'll lose our only
client and we'll also be worthless.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.266
Is there a way to know
exactly what went down?

08:37.267 --> 08:38.268
Not without the cameras.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.941
Although, we found something interesting
in the footage from before the blackout.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.655
What's my office got to
do with this?

08:49.696 --> 08:53.408
The security team checked the camera
footage for anything strange.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.869
This happened a few days ago.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.545
- That's the journalist.
- Yes.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.258
This was the day of
the interviews.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.593
And no one noticed?

09:11.635 --> 09:13.845
It seems that,
when she went to the bathroom,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.514
she also slipped
into the office.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.352
What's she doing?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.604
It looks like a flash drive.

09:22.646 --> 09:23.480
Great.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.905
Did she go anywhere else?

09:33.532 --> 09:34.157
Yes.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.245
We found something else,
but it was from the open house.

09:38.287 --> 09:38.912
Can we see the video, please?

09:40.872 --> 09:44.459
If you want to see Ignacio having sex
with the journalist in the lab...

10:01.351 --> 10:02.811
What's on that computer?

10:02.853 --> 10:05.397
All the information, Ignacio.
All of it.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.189
Anything compromising?

10:07.441 --> 10:10.402
Well, the genetic reconstruction
of the seed

10:10.444 --> 10:13.238
from the beginning of
the process...

10:15.115 --> 10:17.826
The process we
weren't involved in.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.077
Know what I mean?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.957
And can that information lead to...
You know?

10:23.999 --> 10:24.916
No, I don't know.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.251
- Conclusions?
- Conclusions.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.002
Criminal ones.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.631
If you're asking if someone
might analyze the information

10:31.673 --> 10:33.842
and see we aren't the
owners of the seed,

10:33.884 --> 10:35.385
then yes. Absolutely.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.597
- Does it mention Assaf?
- Do I look dumb?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.307
You left data on your computer

10:40.349 --> 10:43.352
that can land us in a cell
with a pedo priest. You tell me!

10:43.393 --> 10:47.064
No, you tell me! I'm not the moron that
brought in a journalist to fuck her!

12:11.022 --> 12:14.234
<i>I'm positive
we have nothing to worry about.</i>

12:14.276 --> 12:16.486
Yeah? You swear? Thanks.

12:16.528 --> 12:21.616
- I finally found peace.
- Lola's investigating something else.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.744
Enough with the conspiracy theories
or you'll turn into a flat earther.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.998
How can you be so naive?
I'm surprised.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.207
I'm naive?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.502
From day one, this woman's
been using you.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.672
Ignacio, she got to you from the start.
You want me to spell it out for you--

12:35.714 --> 12:36.673
Lola's not like that.

12:40.719 --> 12:44.181
You fell in love with the person
who can hurt us the most.

12:57.194 --> 13:01.656
We have to find out exactly what she
knows because everything's at risk.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.826
28.8 grams.

14:39.504 --> 14:40.505
What did you find out?

14:41.047 --> 14:43.383
It seems they also stole
some bags of cannabis.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.051
Bags?

14:45.802 --> 14:47.721
Yes. From the fridge.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.848
Are you sure? Did
you count them?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.309
We counted them ten times.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.854
- We have to call the cops.
- No. Not the police.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.858
Do you know what'll happen
if the government finds out?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.694
They'll take away our permit.
We have to be very careful.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.321
So now what?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.198
Are we gonna sit back
and do nothing?

15:08.325 --> 15:10.243
We have to check
everything carefully.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.455
We checked the footage.

15:14.998 --> 15:15.582
And?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.667
Did you find anything?

15:17.709 --> 15:19.294
Nothing on this.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.963
- We have to tell Mariana.
- No.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.174
Don't tell her yet.

15:24.883 --> 15:25.842
Tell me what?

16:37.789 --> 16:39.290
ELECTRICAL HAZARD

16:39.332 --> 16:40.542
They left through here.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.632
The terrain's rough. They're probably
on foot and not far.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.719
I don't think so. If they left
this way, we've lost them.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.930
We have to do something. If the
thief's here, we have to find him.

16:54.431 --> 16:55.265
Okay.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.269
Let's get flashlights.
Everyone outside!

18:01.581 --> 18:02.707
What's wrong?

18:07.086 --> 18:07.921
Mari.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.342
We'll find them.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.723
It's not just the robbery,
Félix.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.441
<i>We're being investigated.</i>

18:35.073 --> 18:36.574
What do you mean?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.326
That journalist Ignacio brought

18:38.368 --> 18:40.537
went into my office
and took data from my computer.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.916
Information I should've erased months
ago, but there it was.

Disappear?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.747
We're doing a half-assed job.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.123
What're you talking about?

20:07.165 --> 20:08.833
That body shouldn't
have been there.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.335
We shouldn't have left it there.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.171
What should we have done?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.123
Who is it?

21:31.332 --> 21:33.918
Ignacio. Can I come in?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.718
Just a second. I'm
having a problem.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.595
ANOTHER FAILED "VENTURE"?

22:02.071 --> 22:02.905
Everything okay?

22:04.824 --> 22:08.036
I had to turn the water off. I'm
still having problems with my pipes.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.663
Why'd you leave my house?

22:12.206 --> 22:14.667
Your mattress is too fancy, too hard.
It hurt my back.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.255
If you make me stand here,
my back will start to hurt too.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.593
It's 2 a.m.
I have to get up early.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.060
Why are you looking at
me like that?

22:33.644 --> 22:34.520
How?

22:35.229 --> 22:36.064
Like that.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.149
Like you're scared.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.651
Why would I be?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.527
I don't know.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.738
You tell me.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.678
I won't let you go to jail,

23:07.720 --> 23:10.056
- if that's what you're worried about.
- God, Félix.

23:10.098 --> 23:10.890
I'm serious.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.935
Mari, you don't have to
pay for this.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.899
It's much more complicated
than you think.

23:19.941 --> 23:23.361
No. It's all much simpler
than we think.

23:25.488 --> 23:30.076
I'm not in the mood for
shitty motivational speeches.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.328
If you have anything to say,
at least make it useful.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.873
I won't let you spend a single day
in jail because of me.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.166
Wake up.

23:38.793 --> 23:43.756
If there's anyone who can't keep
a single promise, it's you.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.452
And the article you
were researching?

24:59.123 --> 25:00.750
It was time to move on.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.175
Santamaría,

25:11.469 --> 25:12.637
I have to get up early.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.977
Someone stole one of our
mother plants.

25:23.898 --> 25:26.651
With it, they can
replicate our plants.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.824
Fucking shit.

25:35.493 --> 25:38.204
Everything I worked for
could go to hell.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.757
Know what pisses me
off the most?

25:50.591 --> 25:52.093
Among my flock of friends,

25:52.134 --> 25:54.512
you're the only one
I can talk to about this.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.433
The only person I can trust.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.647
You should look for friends
in a different zoo.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.737
That's what I needed.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.281
Some laughs.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.491
Do I look like a clown?

26:16.617 --> 26:18.786
Why don't we move to Thailand?

26:18.828 --> 26:20.788
We'll get a house on the beach,

26:20.830 --> 26:22.581
you can finally tend
to your plants,

26:22.623 --> 26:25.293
and I'll go fishing
for our food.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.879
And die of food poisoning because you
don't know which fish are edible.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.756
I can look them up on Wikipedia.

26:35.553 --> 26:36.929
Why so serious?

26:36.971 --> 26:39.140
I told you. If you don't get it,
it's your problem.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.852
- Let's play a game.
- You're kidding me.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.563
Really. I need to calm down.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.606
Then go sign up for yoga.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.984
Or hug a tree.
But don't come to me at 2 a.m.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.070
It's a very simple game.

26:53.112 --> 26:57.074
Look. I say, "Never
have I ever..."

26:58.576 --> 27:00.536
"ate a hamburger", for example.

27:00.578 --> 27:05.708
If you ever ate a burger, take a drink.
If you never ate one, I drink. Easy.

27:05.750 --> 27:06.751
Just a little while.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.462
And I'll stop annoying you.
You'll go to bed.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.630
I need to clear my head.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.301
Sit down.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.185
You'll like it.

27:27.605 --> 27:28.439
I'll start.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.028
Never have I ever...

27:35.863 --> 27:39.158
dreamed of leaving everything and
moving halfway across the world.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.881
I was never a moron at 2 a.m.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.216
Now we're playing.

27:59.637 --> 28:00.888
Never have I ever...

28:02.264 --> 28:04.850
left a pizza in my living room
for over two days.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.484
I never checked myself in the mirror
more than twice before going out.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.031
I've never cheated on anyone.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.542
I never took
advantage of my name.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.223
I never manipulated someone
to get what I want.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.697
I never stole anything
that wasn't mine.

29:03.534 --> 29:04.869
How do I know that's true?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.036
Because it's true.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.175
I never felt anything
for Ignacio.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.117
I never lied to Lola.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.501
The question's not that hard.

32:17.186 --> 32:18.187
Damn it.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.424
What's going on?

32:50.552 --> 32:52.388
Can you open the gate, please?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.729
Can you open the gate, please?

33:00.771 --> 33:02.064
You in a hurry?

33:03.691 --> 33:06.360
No, I'm tired and sleepy.
It's been a long night.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.569
What happened to your hand?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.948
- What's wrong?
- What happened to your hand?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.784
I told you. I cut myself
when the lights went out.

33:13.826 --> 33:14.827
Open the trunk.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.080
- Why?
- Open it, Susana.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.833
How long have we
known each other?

33:20.874 --> 33:23.043
I feel like I don't
know you at all.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.753
Do you really think
I'm the thief?

33:25.379 --> 33:27.089
Open the trunk.

34:00.372 --> 34:00.998
Alex!

34:02.166 --> 34:04.501
Be careful. And get security,
please.

34:07.254 --> 34:09.131
You'll pay for this.

34:09.173 --> 34:11.592
Yeah? What will you do?

34:11.633 --> 34:15.304
You want the government to find out
the cannabis bags don't add up?

34:15.345 --> 34:16.930
So you planned all of this.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.641
I didn't steal the bags.

34:19.683 --> 34:20.976
Who put you up to this?

34:23.312 --> 34:24.438
Open the gate.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.483
Let me go. Don't ask
for more trouble.

34:34.740 --> 34:35.991
I'll destroy you.

34:36.033 --> 34:38.786
I'll personally make sure
you never work again.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.162
This isn't over yet.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.623
Of course it is.

34:43.791 --> 34:44.625
You think you've got it
under control.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.378
You think, since you're a rich
kid, everything has to go well.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.674
But no. The world doesn't
revolve around you, Mariana.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.469
It's because of
social resentment?

34:58.305 --> 35:00.098
Keep being so naive
and see how you end up.

35:01.141 --> 35:03.143
Get out of here. Open up,
please.

35:04.520 --> 35:08.232
You can't even imagine how many
enemies you have.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.191
You have no idea.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.996
The seeds? Did you finish
counting them?

35:23.038 --> 35:24.706
Do it again, please.
And the samples.

35:24.748 --> 35:25.916
- There's nothing outside.
- It was Susana.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.628
- Susana?
- She had a mother plant in her trunk.

35:29.670 --> 35:30.963
She just left.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.340
That's strange.
Why'd she steal a whole plant

35:33.382 --> 35:35.384
if she only needs a cutting
to replicate it?

35:35.425 --> 35:36.218
You'll have to ask her.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.264
- This is a smoke screen.
- What are you talking about?

35:40.305 --> 35:43.976
She knows how to steal all the genetic
information without this drama.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.561
This is sabotage.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.187
Gabriel, look for a male plant.

35:47.229 --> 35:49.189
- What is it?
- To sabotage this crop,

35:49.231 --> 35:50.566
I'd bring in a male plant.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.109
A male plant?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.527
All these are females.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.070
Yes, I know that.

35:55.112 --> 35:58.115
Then you also know that if you
bring in a male plant

35:58.156 --> 36:00.492
they'll start flowering
and everything's ruined.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.786
Look for a male plant.

37:48.892 --> 37:49.893
Here it is!

38:28.432 --> 38:32.644
ANOTHER FAILED VENTURE?

39:15.395 --> 39:19.191
BODY OF ISRAELI ASSAF BEN AMIR,
FOUND AT TAYRONA

39:43.006 --> 39:43.882
Damn it.
