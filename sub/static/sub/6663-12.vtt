00:00.133 --> 00:03.702
Adult adam:  <i>Back in the '80s,</i>
<i>before pilates</i>
<i>and macrobiotic diets,</i>

00:03.704 --> 00:07.006
<i>Old people were old,</i>
<i>except for one,</i>

00:07.008 --> 00:08.240
<i>My grandfather.</i>
<i>(snaps fingers)</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:10.876
<i>He was a man who loved risk</i>
<i>and took chances.</i>

00:10.878 --> 00:14.613
Get there!
Get there! Yes!
Come on, come on, come on!

00:14.615 --> 00:17.082
<i>He was a connoisseur</i>
<i>of fine spirits.</i>

00:17.084 --> 00:19.451
Oh!  <i>Muy bueno.</i>
<i>(giggles)</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:22.388
<i>In a word, my grandfather</i>
<i>was awesome.</i>

00:22.390 --> 00:24.656
That's game, kiddo.
Better luck next time.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.992
Come on, pops.
Let me win at least one.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.660
That's a terrible lesson.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.696
I'm gonna beat your ass again
real quick.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.899
<i>And in wintertime,</i>
<i>when his friends</i>
<i>retreated to florida,</i>

00:33.901 --> 00:36.101
<i>That's when we always saw</i>
<i>a lot more of him.</i>

00:36.103 --> 00:39.805
Bev, look at this!
Billy joel's coming to town.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.706
You gotta see this!

00:40.708 --> 00:43.342
Not now, dad. I've got
three lunches to make.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.811
Look at this picture of him.

00:45.813 --> 00:49.248
He's wearing the exact same
sunglasses as I am.
Yeah.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.885
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna
call for tickets.

00:52.887 --> 00:53.452
Bevy!

00:53.454 --> 00:55.087
Where's my other black sock?

00:55.089 --> 00:55.888
In your sock drawer.

00:55.890 --> 00:59.725
That drawer is a wasteland
of unmatched pairs.
It's chaos!

00:59.727 --> 01:00.859
Then wear
a different pair.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.328
I've already got
my black one on!

01:03.330 --> 01:04.663
Ugh! This is a nightmare!

01:04.665 --> 01:07.199
(crunches) ow! Ow!
My tooth! My tooth!

01:07.201 --> 01:09.234
How do you hurt yourself
eating cereal?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.436
I bit the free toy!
(pounds counter)

01:10.438 --> 01:14.540
If it doesn't
look like cereal,
don't chew on it.

01:14.841 --> 01:15.874
Dad, you're in the way!

01:15.876 --> 01:17.843
(stammers) I'm just calling
the ticket broker.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.245
You and me are gonna sit
front and center.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.414
Dad, can you please
go in the den?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.349
Everywhere I step,
there you are.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.717
You're underfoot.
Hmm.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.687
And billy joel
can wait.
Bye.

01:28.689 --> 01:29.755
Whoa!

01:29.757 --> 01:31.523
Don't say "bye."

01:31.525 --> 01:33.258
Your s.A.T. Prep course
is at 4:00,

01:33.260 --> 01:34.827
So get your ass
home after school.

01:34.829 --> 01:36.462
(singsongy) I don't know
what you're saying.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.564
Well, take off
your walkboy.

01:38.566 --> 01:39.965
It's called a "walkman."

01:39.967 --> 01:41.900
Oh, now you can hear me?

01:41.902 --> 01:42.601
I wish I couldn't.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.237
(phone hangs up)
the tickets
are all sold out.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.707
(door closes)
let's roam around
the bad neighborhoods

01:48.709 --> 01:50.242
Until we find a scalper.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.077
Dad, I've got 17 loads
of laundry to do.

01:52.079 --> 01:55.214
I'm gonna go put on my shoes,
and I'll wait in the car.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.417
All right, bevy,
today I went
with the blue socks,

01:58.419 --> 02:00.586
But we're just kicking
the can down the road.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.286
Can you do me a favor?

02:01.288 --> 02:03.222
(sighs)
take my dad to work
with you today.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.824
He's been retired 10 years.
Why would he want to do that?

02:05.826 --> 02:07.893
I don't care what he wants.
I want him out of here.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.028
(lowered voice)
go ask him.

02:10.030 --> 02:10.929
Hey, albert.

02:10.931 --> 02:14.900
How would you like to come
to the store with me today?
Nah.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.768
Well, I tried.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.469
He's your problem now.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.971
Adult adam:
<i>My parents were</i>
<i>together so long,</i>

02:18.973 --> 02:23.242
<i>They could have an entire</i>
<i>fight all about you,</i>
<i>inches away,</i>

02:23.244 --> 02:24.910
<i>Without ever making a sound.</i>

02:24.912 --> 02:25.878
(both mouthing words)

02:25.880 --> 02:29.615
Hey, albert, vic and the guys
were just talking with me
the other day,

02:29.617 --> 02:32.784
And, uh, they were saying
how much they'd love
you to stop by.

02:32.786 --> 02:37.189
We all would.
For god sake, murray,
can't you take a hint?

02:37.191 --> 02:39.358
I don't wanna go.
I understand.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.095
Adult adam:
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>it only took a look.</i>

02:43.097 --> 02:44.463
But I insist.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.898
Fine.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.433
(mouths words)

02:48.435 --> 02:49.601
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:49.603 --> 02:54.673
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:56.276 --> 02:57.009
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:57.011 --> 03:00.612
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

03:00.614 --> 03:03.382
Adult adam:
<i>It was January 11th,</i>
<i>1980-something,</i>

03:03.384 --> 03:05.751
<i>And pops was headed back</i>
<i>to his old stomping grounds.</i>

03:05.753 --> 03:10.322
Hey, vic. Look at
this hobo I found out
wandering the street.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.292
Ohh. (chuckles)
you kidding me?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.326
Do my eyes deceive me?

03:14.328 --> 03:17.062
(strained voice)
ohh! Okay.
(laughs)

03:17.064 --> 03:19.164
I'm easy.
Try picking up that one.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.434
Hell, no.
Yeah, go ahead.
Bust my balls.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.402
That's what we do.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.171
My god, look at this place.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.739
I barely recognize it.

03:27.741 --> 03:31.143
Yeah, I made
some upgrades,
expanded the showroom,

03:31.145 --> 03:32.411
Put in track lighting.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.712
What the hell's that?

03:33.714 --> 03:34.580
Ah.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.982
We do all our inventory
on computers now.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.750
What is this,
the  <i>star wars?</i>

03:38.752 --> 03:40.419
What about
sheila the redhead,

03:40.421 --> 03:42.454
Who comes in saturdays
to do the books?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.655
Oh, I got rid of her.
What?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.824
Yeah, she'd been stealing
from us for years.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.193
That's the price you pay
for great gams.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.262
Now all you have
to look at is vic.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.164
Oh, you've
never seen my gams.

03:52.166 --> 03:52.831
Oh, yeah, softball.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.501
What's next, you give
vic's job to a robot?

03:56.503 --> 03:57.936
I gotta see my office.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.371
Hey, come here a second.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.574
Listen, um... I want you
to spend the day with him.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.078
He's got a lot of energy,
and he tends to get underfoot.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.579
(crash)

04:07.780 --> 04:10.649
Pops: Hey, you've got new
glass shelves, too!

04:10.651 --> 04:12.184
Adult adam:
<i>While pops was</i>
<i>tiring out my dad,</i>

04:12.186 --> 04:17.189
<i>I was trying to keep up</i>
<i>with my long-time crush,</i>
<i>dana caldwell.</i>

04:17.191 --> 04:19.258
You let me win!

04:20.126 --> 04:21.393
(panting)

04:21.395 --> 04:23.729
Yeah. That's what I did.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.763
Oh, boy.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.497
I should get going.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.200
I've gotta read
<i>to kill a mockingbird</i>
<i>for english.</i>

04:28.202 --> 04:31.803
You know, I got
the cliffsnotes in my room.
You wanna borrow 'em?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.338
Okay. (chuckles)

04:33.573 --> 04:35.007
Adult adam:
<i>Yep, it was happening.</i>

04:35.009 --> 04:38.176
<i>I had a girl in my bedroom</i>
<i>for the very first time.</i>

04:38.178 --> 04:39.911
Here you go.
Thank you.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.214
So... This is
your room, huh?

04:42.216 --> 04:45.851
Adult adam:
<i>This was it. The moment</i>
<i>every man waits for.</i>

04:45.853 --> 04:47.185
<i>Time to show her</i>
<i>what goes down</i>

04:47.187 --> 04:49.454
<i>In adam goldberg's</i>
<i>private quarters.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:52.858
This is where
the magic happens.

04:55.528 --> 04:56.862
<i>Voila.</i>

04:56.864 --> 04:59.364
(gasps)
oh, what's that
behind your ear?

04:59.366 --> 05:02.567
Soft red ball.
Just a little taste.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.802
Do you like transformers?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.771
What are they again?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.940
Hello. They're robots
in disguise.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.942
It's an exciting time
in the franchise.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.211
They're branching out
from vehicles

05:13.213 --> 05:14.946
To dinosaurs and insects.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.315
(nervously) that is exciting.

05:16.317 --> 05:19.384
Do you like he-man?
I guess.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.987
Castle grayskull.

05:22.555 --> 05:25.891
Skeletor lives there.
Whatever.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.160
Do you like g.I. Joe?

05:28.162 --> 05:29.561
Don't answer yet.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.563
Right this way.

05:32.732 --> 05:35.934
Behold,
the  <i>u.S.S. Flagg.</i>

05:35.936 --> 05:38.470
That takes up a lot of room.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.872
Well, yeah.
It's an aircraft carrier.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.574
It's meant
to hold aircraft.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.042
It's all right there
in the name.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.311
Adult adam:
<i>Yep, this was going perfectly.</i>

05:46.313 --> 05:49.781
<i>But what happened next</i>
<i>would really rock my world.</i>

05:49.783 --> 05:51.650
(angelic music playing)

05:53.519 --> 05:55.354
(nervously) I gotta go.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.955
(music warps and stops)

05:56.957 --> 05:58.957
(huffs)
thank you for your time!

05:58.959 --> 06:02.194
Adult adam:
<i>...I said for no</i>
<i>reason at all!</i>

06:02.196 --> 06:03.061
<i>As baffled as I was,</i>

06:03.063 --> 06:04.329
<i>My dad was</i>
<i>even more confused</i>

06:04.331 --> 06:07.332
<i>When he got back</i>
<i>from his lunch break.</i>
<i>Little bit higher, vic.</i>

06:07.334 --> 06:07.899
Almost got it.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell
is going on here?

06:10.738 --> 06:11.870
Going out of business?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.872
Damn it.
I was gonna
surprise you.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.141
We don't go for
these gimmicks anymore.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.943
It's a proven
sales technique.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.712
I'm just juicing
things up a bit.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.849
It's not
a furniture store now.

06:23.851 --> 06:24.783
It's a hip lounge.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.885
Number one,
it is a furniture store.

06:26.887 --> 06:32.657
Number two, the two biggest
enemies of furniture
are smoke and coffee.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.126
And jheri curl juice.

06:34.128 --> 06:34.693
Three enemies!

06:34.695 --> 06:38.330
(groans)
who wants jazz?

06:39.365 --> 06:41.800
Okay. What the hell
is going on here?

06:41.802 --> 06:45.504
You were supposed
to play gin rummy with him
in the backroom all day.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.038
Nah, he wouldn't stay put.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.142
That old man's got so much
energy and charisma.

06:50.144 --> 06:54.079
Now you can learn a thing
or two from him. Mm-hmm.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.381
(up-tempo jazz playing)

06:56.582 --> 06:59.050
Ah, charisma.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.686
I don't know what happened.
It was going so great.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.723
And then she just ran off
for no reason.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.424
Why would she do that?

07:05.426 --> 07:08.727
'cause no girl on this planet
would ever wanna make out
in this room.

07:08.729 --> 07:12.697
Seriously, it looks like
a nerd bomb went off in here.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.434
I hate to admit it,
but the idiot's right.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.468
It was the toys.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.335
So my toys
freaked her out?

07:17.337 --> 07:20.172
The fact that you have toys
freaked her out.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.274
Listen, chicks like
waterbeds

07:22.276 --> 07:27.379
And samurai swords
that elegantly
hang over a fireplace.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.547
It's a scientific fact.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.949
He's still an idiot.
But he's right.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.685
If you want
dana to like you,
lose the toys.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.287
I can't.
They're like family.

07:35.289 --> 07:39.691
What would you rather touch?
A boob or a dinobot?

07:40.927 --> 07:41.993
You took too long!

07:41.995 --> 07:43.328
The answer is clearly "boob."

07:43.330 --> 07:47.632
You're in seventh grade, bud.
It's time to grow up.

07:49.101 --> 07:49.634
She's right.

07:49.636 --> 07:54.339
From now on, you gotta
stop playing with toys
and start acting like a man.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.609
First step, drakkar noir.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.612
No woman can resist
its alluring stink.

08:00.614 --> 08:05.183
Now you never apply it
directly onto your own skin.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.820
You simply mist...
(spritzes)

08:08.888 --> 08:09.688
And walk through.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.757
Adult adam:
<i>While my lesson on how</i>
<i>to be a man had just begun,</i>

08:12.759 --> 08:17.395
<i>My dad was happy his day</i>
<i>with pops had come to an end.</i>

08:18.364 --> 08:19.498
There you are.
(door closes)

08:19.500 --> 08:22.067
How'd it go with my dad?
Did you have a good time?

08:22.069 --> 08:22.701
Give me a minute.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.604
Can't a man
take off his pants?
(pants rustle on floor)

08:25.905 --> 08:27.772
Have you been smoking?

08:27.774 --> 08:28.673
A cigar?

08:28.675 --> 08:31.243
Two! With some low-end cognac.

08:31.245 --> 08:37.349
Your dad turned
my discount furniture store
into the copacabana.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.185
Oh. I'm nauseous.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.319
Well, thank you
for doing that.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.322
You owe me.
I'd like, uh,
some shrimp parm...

08:44.324 --> 08:46.358
With extra shrimp
and extra parm.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.159
I thought you said
you were nauseous.

08:48.161 --> 08:48.827
I'll fight through it.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.095
Okay, you got it.
I'm not moving.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.532
I'm gonna eat right here.
All right,
don't be such a baby.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.066
It was only for one day.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.235
Adult adam:
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

08:57.237 --> 08:58.803
<i>That one day turned into two.</i>

08:58.805 --> 09:01.139
(pops) ...Kroehler sofas
for half that price.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.643
Well, it's fine. I got some
good leads in the rolodex.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.944
Al, what are you doing?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.312
Uh, what do you know?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.848
You found some
at that price.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.016
Yeah, I'll take 'em all.

09:11.018 --> 09:15.020
Adult adam:
<i>And those two days would</i>
<i>turn into the longest week</i>

09:15.022 --> 09:17.188
<i>Of my father's life.</i>

09:18.591 --> 09:19.324
<i>Now that I was a man,</i>

09:19.326 --> 09:21.726
<i>It was time to break</i>
<i>some tough news</i>
<i>to some old friends.</i>

09:21.728 --> 09:25.897
Sorry, lion-o.
Sorry, cheetara.
It's time to grow up.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.532
(sighs)

09:27.534 --> 09:28.800
(sadly) thundercats ho!

09:28.802 --> 09:29.935
Adult adam:
<i>And after five trips,</i>

09:29.937 --> 09:32.671
<i>I had successfully</i>
<i>packed up all my toys.</i>

09:32.673 --> 09:33.605
Mom, I'm going out.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.874
Wear your jacket
and your muffs.

09:35.876 --> 09:36.775
I'm a grown man!

09:36.777 --> 09:38.910
(door closes)
adult adam:
<i>And I was on a mission.</i>

09:38.912 --> 09:43.648
<i>A mission to prove that</i>
<i>the geeky little kid in me</i>
<i>was gone forever.</i>

09:43.650 --> 09:45.850
<i>Literally,</i>
<i>nothing could stop me.</i>

09:45.852 --> 09:46.851
It's actually
kind of cold out.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.521
Oh, your nose is all pink
like a little kitten.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.056
Mom.
Meow.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.657
Stop.
Meow, meow, meow!

09:52.659 --> 09:54.459
Stop it.
(chuckles)

09:54.461 --> 09:55.927
(door closes)

09:56.796 --> 09:58.930
Oh. Hey.

10:01.334 --> 10:01.700
Howdy.

10:01.702 --> 10:07.272
So... The other day when
you were over at my house,

10:07.274 --> 10:08.073
You ran off so fast,

10:08.075 --> 10:10.842
That I didn't get a chance
to tell you something.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.344
The reason why
I showed you my toys was

10:12.346 --> 10:17.449
'cause I've outgrown 'em,
and I thought maybe your
little brother might like 'em.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.517
You really wanna give
all your toys away?

10:19.519 --> 10:21.353
Yeah, I've been meaning
to do it for years,

10:21.355 --> 10:23.521
Plus I need to clear
some shelf space

10:23.523 --> 10:27.492
For my cologne,
beer can collection,
and jock straps.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.827
Well, that's so nice of you.

10:28.829 --> 10:32.764
Dougie, adam goldberg brought
a whole bunch of toys for you.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.266
Cool!

10:36.902 --> 10:38.136
Awesome!

10:38.138 --> 10:40.205
Had it. Have it.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.039
Sell it.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.507
(toy clatters)
dougie: Have it.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.109
Wanna come in?

10:44.111 --> 10:46.044
Sure.
Okay.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.748
(toys clattering)

10:51.517 --> 10:53.818
Now listen and listen good,
you little putz.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.388
That's sergeant slaughter
of the renegade squadron,

10:56.390 --> 11:01.292
And you're gonna treat him
and all my toys with
the respect that they deserve,

11:01.294 --> 11:02.727
Or so help me, I...

11:02.729 --> 11:04.162
Adam? You coming?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.264
Hey, you bet.
(chuckles)

11:07.466 --> 11:08.566
Adult adam:
<i>I'd given up my toys,</i>

11:08.568 --> 11:13.438
<i>But pops wasn't</i>
<i>giving up on his</i>
<i>big plans for the store.</i>

11:13.639 --> 11:14.806
You busy?

11:14.808 --> 11:15.473
Does it matter?

11:15.475 --> 11:22.814
Well, I just discovered that
the key to our success
has been here all the time.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.149
(pen clatters)

11:24.151 --> 11:27.752
Back in the old days,
before I hired you,

11:27.754 --> 11:31.656
I had an ad running
on the local tv.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.390
Business boomed.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.526
Okay, before you say
anything else,

11:34.528 --> 11:39.964
Just know that making
a commercial is way
too expensive for us.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.033
Way ahead of you, mur.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.168
That's why we use this.

11:43.170 --> 11:47.806
<i>Hey there, ladies.</i>
<i>Put down those vacuum</i>
<i>cleaners for a second.</i>

11:47.808 --> 11:49.908
<i>Big al's got something to say.</i>

11:49.910 --> 11:51.476
<i>(chuckles)</i>

11:51.844 --> 11:53.678
<i>When your man comes</i>
<i>home at night,</i>

11:53.680 --> 11:55.513
<i>Don't you want him</i>
<i>to see furniture</i>

11:55.515 --> 11:59.651
<i>That looks just as</i>
<i>gorgeous as you do?</i>

12:00.319 --> 12:01.786
<i>Hey.</i>

12:02.321 --> 12:03.421
<i>Thanks, sheila.</i>

12:03.423 --> 12:09.594
<i>Down at the ottoman empire,</i>
<i>we got sofas</i>
<i>starting at $35.99.</i>

12:09.596 --> 12:11.262
<i>Can you buy on credit?</i>
<i>You bet!</i>

12:11.264 --> 12:13.231
<i>With your husband's</i>
<i>signature, of course.</i>

12:13.233 --> 12:18.303
<i>So come on down</i>
<i>and let big al service you.</i>

12:18.305 --> 12:21.673
(man reading)

12:22.942 --> 12:23.808
I think it holds up
pretty well.

12:23.810 --> 12:29.080
I think it's amazing
that there was a time
when that was okay.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.815
We're not running
this commercial.

12:30.817 --> 12:37.522
Albert, you worked so hard
making ottoman empire
what it is today,

12:37.524 --> 12:39.791
But don't you think
now is the time

12:39.793 --> 12:46.264
To do things like play golf
or take a steam
or feed the pigeons?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.665
Pigeons.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.400
That does sound fun.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.736
We agree? No commercial?

12:51.738 --> 12:54.973
No commercial.
I totally get it.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.741
Adult adam:
<i>But he didn't get it.</i>

12:56.743 --> 12:59.177
Man: Quiet on the set!
(indistinct conversations)

12:59.179 --> 13:01.045
Murray: Damn it, albert.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.213
What did I say?

13:02.215 --> 13:05.250
You're gonna love
this commercial, mur.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.251
I'm insane albert.

13:06.253 --> 13:11.356
I price my furniture so low,
I require hospitalization.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.857
(chuckles)
he's crazy al.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.560
Yeah, I get it.
No commercial!

13:15.562 --> 13:16.361
Send everybody home.

13:16.363 --> 13:21.266
Oh, I can't do that.
I already hired the crew,
bought this straitjacket.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.967
It is cheaper
than renting it.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.969
Vic, go away...

13:24.971 --> 13:27.105
Far away.
Vic, you stay.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.842
He's the orderly
that wheels me back
into the loony bin

13:30.844 --> 13:33.978
'cause my prices
are bananas.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.914
Come here, albert.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.484
Look, I've tried being
nice to you all week.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.385
I can't do it anymore.

13:40.387 --> 13:44.222
You gotta take off
the straitjacket
and go home.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.089
Please!

13:45.091 --> 13:46.958
I didn't wanna
play this card,

13:46.960 --> 13:49.494
But I do own 51%
of the business,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.362
So the decision is mine.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.163
What are you saying?

13:52.165 --> 13:55.200
This commercial is
happening whether
you like it or not.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.067
Now if you'll excuse me,

13:56.069 --> 14:00.939
I have to go back
and get into my mentally
unstable character.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.509
You got that covered.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.246
(grunting and panting)

14:09.148 --> 14:11.616
Honey, what happened
to all your toys?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.685
Gave 'em away.
It's cool.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.452
Hey.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.121
Can you float me
roughly $2,000?

14:17.123 --> 14:17.856
May I ask for what?

14:17.858 --> 14:20.491
A waterbed
and a decorative samurai
sword to hang above it.

14:20.493 --> 14:24.128
A samurai sword
will fall off the wall
in the middle of the night,

14:24.130 --> 14:26.331
Poke your eye out,
puncture the mattress,

14:26.333 --> 14:28.233
And then you'll drown
in your sleep.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.134
Is that a "no"?
Yes, that's a "no."

14:30.136 --> 14:33.938
Honey, you can't give
your toys away.
You love 'em so much.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.974
Toys are kids' stuff.

14:35.976 --> 14:36.541
I'm a man now.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.643
(dumbbells thud and clink)
as of yesterday.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.246
A very happy,
happy man.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.649
(spritzes)

14:45.584 --> 14:48.620
That's barry's smell.
Why do you smell like barry?

14:48.622 --> 14:51.155
It's drakkar noir.
He gave it to me.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.591
<i>I love to spend money</i>
<i>on a girl...</i>
<i>(click)</i>

14:53.593 --> 14:55.026
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.429
What the hell?
What did you two idiots do?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.131
That could mean
so many things.

15:00.133 --> 15:04.469
Why did my scrumptious
little baby give
away all his toys?

15:04.471 --> 15:05.803
We just told him
the truth, mom.

15:05.805 --> 15:09.841
Yeah. He'll never get
any action with
his room full of toys.

15:09.843 --> 15:12.510
He doesn't need any action.
He's a little boy.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.412
I'm going over there right now
and getting his toys back.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.649
If you do, you're gonna
cost him his first girlfriend.

15:17.651 --> 15:20.518
He doesn't need a girlfriend.
He's got me.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.386
Ew.
Yuck.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.489
I didn't mean girlfriend.
I meant... (sighs)

15:24.491 --> 15:26.057
Main lady.

15:26.225 --> 15:26.925
That is so much worse.

15:26.927 --> 15:32.130
I meant woman in his life
that he loves more
than anyone else.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.265
Mom, you're in free fall.
Pull the rip cord.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.301
I'm going over there
to get those toys back.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.737
You two are grounded
for a year.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.240
You hear me? A year.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.044
Glad you messed with me?
You should know better.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.812
Hey there.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.981
What great old toys.

15:50.082 --> 15:50.915
I'm from a local charity,

15:50.917 --> 15:54.385
And I was wondering
if you'd take 20
whole dollars for them.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.554
You're adam goldberg's mother.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.023
Okay, I didn't know
you knew that.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.192
Listen...

16:01.194 --> 16:05.063
My son adam is at
a transitional age right now.

16:05.065 --> 16:09.367
He's starting to mature
and to have feelings he's...

16:09.369 --> 16:11.169
Never felt before, and...

16:11.171 --> 16:11.836
I want a turtle.

16:11.838 --> 16:15.440
That's nice. Why don't you
go in and get your mom?

16:15.442 --> 16:16.975
(toys clatter)

16:17.977 --> 16:20.244
Go on. Get mama.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.316
(toys clatter)

16:39.398 --> 16:41.332
Hi. (panting)

16:41.334 --> 16:42.700
You must be dana's mom.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.802
I'm beverly goldberg.

16:44.804 --> 16:45.303
(clatter)

16:45.305 --> 16:48.306
Well, I'll have you over
for brunch, okay?

16:48.308 --> 16:51.743
Bye-bye. This was fun.
(laughs)

16:51.844 --> 16:54.345
Adult adam:
<i>After pops took off</i>
<i>his straitjacket,</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:57.782
<i>He finally</i>
<i>regained his sanity.</i>

16:57.784 --> 16:59.283
Hey, can we talk?

16:59.285 --> 17:01.252
It's up to you.
You're the boss.

17:01.254 --> 17:05.089
I can give you, uh,
51% of the couch.

17:05.091 --> 17:10.028
Stop it, will ya?
I came to apologize.

17:11.463 --> 17:12.397
Look...

17:12.399 --> 17:16.401
It's tough always feeling
like you're underfoot.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.435
I was doing okay with it,

17:17.437 --> 17:22.206
But then when I walked
back in here, uh...

17:22.208 --> 17:24.242
I felt like
I mattered again.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.377
Stop it. You matter.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.513
This is your
store, murray.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.382
You've done a hell of
a job with it for 10 years.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.018
Better than I could've done.

17:34.153 --> 17:37.722
Which is why
I've decided...

17:38.157 --> 17:41.125
To give you this.

17:43.662 --> 17:44.862
That's my 2%.

17:44.864 --> 17:49.700
You should be
the majority owner.
This is your store now.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.137
Thank you, albert.
It means a lot.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.707
(exhales deeply)

17:56.709 --> 17:59.911
I'm gonna
miss this place.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.012
Oh, you...

18:01.014 --> 18:04.849
You could always come by,
like, once a week
to check on things.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.286
I can put another desk
next to mine in the office.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.121
Nah. I couldn't do that.

18:10.123 --> 18:10.688
You could.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.125
Walnut. Danish modern
with a teak inlay.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.760
Don't cheap out.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.595
Now come here
and give me a hug.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.429
Uh, I'm not a big hugger.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.133
Get over here,
you bastard.

18:38.885 --> 18:39.517
I brought 'em back

18:39.519 --> 18:41.586
'cause I know you
didn't really wanna
give them away.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.921
What? No, that's not true.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.357
Your mom came over.
That damn woman.

18:46.359 --> 18:47.158
That's okay.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.027
My mom would have
done the same thing

18:50.029 --> 18:52.463
If I gave away
all my care bears.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.764
Wait. It wasn't the toys?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.367
Then why did you run out
of my room the other day?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.269
I ran out 'cause...

18:58.271 --> 19:00.972
I thought we
were gonna kiss.

19:01.039 --> 19:04.408
Not that
I didn't wanna kiss.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.077
I just...

19:06.079 --> 19:07.478
Got nervous.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.081
So...

19:10.083 --> 19:13.751
Thank you for
bringing my stuff.
See you at school.

19:14.386 --> 19:15.920
Thank you!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.191
(mimicking shooting)

19:22.261 --> 19:26.030
Stupid. I was
supposed to kiss her.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.932
Stupid, stupid!

19:27.934 --> 19:30.067
Yeah, you blew it.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.570
But we'll work on it.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.071
(mimicking shooting)

19:34.073 --> 19:40.344
Never thought I'd say it,
but this computer is way
better than sheila's gams.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.847
Hey, mur.
We got a tough customer.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.749
You wanna work your magic?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.421
You coming?

19:50.656 --> 19:52.990
You bet your ass.

19:54.326 --> 19:58.095
Adult adam:
<i>Yeah, getting older</i>
<i>is confusing and complicated,</i>

19:58.097 --> 19:59.163
<i>But no matter</i>
<i>how hard we tried,</i>

19:59.165 --> 20:03.401
<i>Pops couldn't slow it down,</i>
<i>and that day,</i>

20:03.403 --> 20:04.468
<i>I decided not</i>
<i>to rush it either.</i>

20:04.470 --> 20:08.439
(growly voice) I am megatron,
leader of the decepticons.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.008
I am optimus prime,
and I am a good guy,

20:11.010 --> 20:12.710
And I will kick your butt!
(knock on door)

20:12.712 --> 20:14.245
(normal voice)

20:14.247 --> 20:15.947
Murray: (muffled voice)

20:15.949 --> 20:19.951
Oh, no! The bad guys
are coming for us! Aah!

20:21.253 --> 20:25.056

20:25.058 --> 20:25.756
(knock on door)

20:25.758 --> 20:26.924
(normal voice)

20:26.926 --> 20:29.260
Man: (muffled voice)

20:29.262 --> 20:30.661

20:31.029 --> 20:33.798
(robotic voice)
I am good and...

20:33.800 --> 20:34.699
This is it.

20:34.701 --> 20:38.402
Aah! That hurt!
Aah! (laughs)

20:39.171 --> 20:40.638
Hey! I'm murray the maniac.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.608

20:43.610 --> 20:45.343

20:45.345 --> 20:46.877
Hello! I'm murray the maniac,

20:46.879 --> 20:50.248
And I'm committed

20:50.250 --> 20:53.618
You think that was too much,
the way I went, "insane"?

20:53.620 --> 20:56.053
(beep)

20:56.055 --> 20:57.188
Well, I came out while
you were saying "action."

20:57.190 --> 20:59.190
Does that matter?
Okay, all right,

20:59.192 --> 21:00.858
(beep)

21:00.860 --> 21:02.393

21:02.395 --> 21:03.894
Hi. I'm insane.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.730
No, it's "insane prices."

21:05.732 --> 21:07.031
It's "hello."
(beep)

21:07.033 --> 21:08.266
Just help me up. Help me up.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.467
Help me up.
Just push from behind.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.102
I like what you were
doing, man.

21:11.104 --> 21:15.706

21:15.708 --> 21:18.676

21:18.678 --> 21:19.543
Vic: "a."

21:19.545 --> 21:20.778

21:20.780 --> 21:21.579

21:21.581 --> 21:25.316
