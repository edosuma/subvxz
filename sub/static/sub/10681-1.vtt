[upbeat funky music]

00:12.084 --> 00:15.119
If you guys could have
any pet in pop culture...

00:15.121 --> 00:16.553
I'm not gonna limit it to comics...

00:16.555 --> 00:17.955
Who would you pick?

00:17.957 --> 00:19.957
All right, I would pick
Gizmo from "Gremlins."

00:19.959 --> 00:21.959
I mean, I would take care of him properly,

00:21.961 --> 00:23.160
you know, not feed him after midnight...

00:23.162 --> 00:24.161
Not a chance.

00:24.163 --> 00:25.297
No sunlight.

00:25.298 --> 00:27.062
You don't even take
care of your own kids.

00:27.222 --> 00:29.099
- How are you gonna take care of...
- [laughter]

00:29.101 --> 00:31.068
Of... of a mogwai?

00:31.070 --> 00:32.336
- Mike?
- The rock ape.

00:32.338 --> 00:34.138
Igoo from "The Herculoids."

00:34.140 --> 00:35.506
- Rock ape?
- Yeah.

00:35.508 --> 00:36.507
[laughter]

00:36.509 --> 00:37.808
It weighs about 10 tons.

00:37.810 --> 00:39.476
It's got an anger issue.

00:39.478 --> 00:41.324
Do you have to take this Igoo for a walk

00:41.325 --> 00:43.514
- and, like, clean up after it?
- No, it's a game.

00:43.516 --> 00:45.082
Imagine what... imagine if he'd start

00:45.084 --> 00:46.283
throwing number two
at you. It's like a...

00:46.285 --> 00:47.618
It's like big, gigantic boulders.

00:47.620 --> 00:48.952
[laughter]

00:48.954 --> 00:50.254
What about you, Bry?

00:50.256 --> 00:52.256
I'm gonna say Lassie,

00:52.258 --> 00:55.492
because I will never accomplish anything

00:55.494 --> 00:57.094
really of note in my life,

00:57.096 --> 00:58.462
but if I have a dog

00:58.464 --> 01:00.631
who's always doing something extraordinary

01:00.633 --> 01:02.833
and, like, enough to,
like, get public notice...

01:02.835 --> 01:04.435
You can maybe get your
picture in the paper.

01:04.437 --> 01:05.636
Yeah.

01:05.638 --> 01:06.770
Always standing next to Lassie.

01:06.772 --> 01:08.305
Ride on Lassie's coattails.

01:08.307 --> 01:09.606
I kind of think Lassie
will have her hands full,

01:09.608 --> 01:11.175
just rescuing you from your...

01:11.177 --> 01:12.176
From your everyday life.

01:12.178 --> 01:13.210
[laughter]

01:13.212 --> 01:14.545
Bryan's in a well again.

Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "Comic Book Men,"

01:53.044 --> 01:56.078
the only show that knows they
were growing medical marijuana

01:56.080 --> 01:58.313
on Clark Kent's farm.

01:58.315 --> 01:59.381
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:59.383 --> 02:00.649
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

02:00.651 --> 02:01.817
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

02:01.819 --> 02:03.419
All right, gentlemen,

02:03.421 --> 02:05.387
what happened in the Fortress
of Comictude this week?

02:05.389 --> 02:09.258
The godfather of Halloween
items came into The Stash.

02:15.765 --> 02:16.999
Hey, guys, how you doing today?

02:17.001 --> 02:18.600
Hey.

02:18.602 --> 02:20.069
Got something I think
you might be interested in.

02:20.071 --> 02:21.403
What do you got?

02:21.405 --> 02:23.338
The 1977 Don Post Chewbacca mask.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.873
Oh, my God.

02:24.875 --> 02:26.408
You've got Chewbacca's head in there.

02:26.410 --> 02:28.444
Like that film "Seven."

02:28.446 --> 02:29.511
What's in the box?

02:29.513 --> 02:31.447
[laughter]

02:37.587 --> 02:38.954
I loved Chewbacca.

02:38.956 --> 02:40.456
This may be one of the coolest things

02:40.458 --> 02:41.957
that's ever walked in here.

02:41.959 --> 02:44.059
I think I know where
Mike got his hairstyle from.

02:44.061 --> 02:45.694
[laughter]

02:45.696 --> 02:47.896
Now, there's a $55 price tag

02:47.898 --> 02:49.031
written on the front in pencil.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.733
Yes.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.601
So that would have been,
like, you know, $400 today.

02:52.603 --> 02:54.470
This cost more than
every Halloween costume

02:54.472 --> 02:55.738
I ever had combined.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.273
[laughter]

02:58.275 --> 03:00.743
There were two names in Halloween:

03:00.745 --> 03:02.044
Ben Cooper.

03:02.046 --> 03:03.445
Half a mask went over your face,

03:03.447 --> 03:04.780
had a rubber band went around the back,

03:04.782 --> 03:07.149
you know, for the budgeted people.

03:07.151 --> 03:10.085
And for those parents who
really loved their children,

03:10.087 --> 03:11.553
Don Post.

03:11.555 --> 03:13.288
That looked like they
could put them in a movie.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.289
Oh, yeah.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.425
I mean, these were high-end.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.594
I didn't know anybody who had
a Don Post mask growing up.

03:18.596 --> 03:20.596
No.

03:20.598 --> 03:22.464
No parent where we grew
up would have ever been like,

03:22.466 --> 03:25.501
"Yeah, $50 for a mask is reasonable, here."

03:25.503 --> 03:28.403
I was lucky if I got
Ben Cooper on November 1st.

03:28.405 --> 03:30.339
[laughter]

03:30.341 --> 03:33.742
- Do you mind if I take it out?
- Sure, go ahead.

03:33.744 --> 03:35.010
It feels so weird.

03:35.012 --> 03:36.445
It feels like real hair...

03:36.447 --> 03:39.148
that hadn't been washed in 40 years.

03:39.150 --> 03:40.582
I mean, look at the attention to detail.

03:40.584 --> 03:41.683
It's freaking me out, man.

03:41.685 --> 03:44.186
I expect it to start growling.

03:44.188 --> 03:45.788
Do you have a favorite Chewbacca moment?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.923
I liked when he got Yoda to escape

03:47.925 --> 03:49.191
in "Revenge of the Sith."

03:49.193 --> 03:51.493
Saved his life, and the Jedi live on.

03:51.495 --> 03:52.861
My favorite moment...

03:52.863 --> 03:54.763
I mean, it always sends
chills down my spine,

03:54.765 --> 03:56.698
is, at the beginning
of... of "Empire,"

03:56.700 --> 03:59.201
Luke and Han are out on Hoth,

03:59.203 --> 04:00.536
and they have to close the doors.

04:00.538 --> 04:02.104
They can't send anymore search parties.

04:02.106 --> 04:03.772
And as the door closes,

04:03.774 --> 04:05.707
Chewbacca starts the most haunting

04:05.709 --> 04:07.776
Chewbacca wail ever.

04:07.778 --> 04:11.880
I think it was the most
human moment in the movie,

04:11.882 --> 04:12.981
and it was performed by the Wookiee.

04:12.983 --> 04:13.982
Maybe in the entire trilogy.

04:13.984 --> 04:15.384
Yeah.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.019
Do you know how talented you have to be

04:17.021 --> 04:19.855
to pull off a role where
you're not speaking any words

04:19.857 --> 04:21.857
and still let people know what you're

04:21.858 --> 04:24.393
trying to do as the character and stuff?

04:24.395 --> 04:25.460
Tell us, Silent Bob.

04:25.462 --> 04:26.695
[laughter]

04:26.697 --> 04:29.865
You saw that coming, did you?

04:29.867 --> 04:32.501
I think it would be a
good pickup for us, you know?

04:32.503 --> 04:33.836
So what do you want for it?

04:33.838 --> 04:35.470
Looking to get $325.

04:35.472 --> 04:36.872
$325.

04:36.874 --> 04:38.674
The box is a little, uh...

04:38.676 --> 04:41.410
A little tape issue there in the box.

04:41.412 --> 04:42.477
How about $200?

04:42.479 --> 04:44.346
I can't go that low, no.

04:44.348 --> 04:46.982
$250?

04:46.984 --> 04:48.083
I could do $250.

04:48.085 --> 04:49.518
- Absolutely.
- Thanks a lot.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.821
Good deal.

04:52.823 --> 04:54.356
There you go.

04:54.358 --> 04:55.858
- Take care, guys.
- All right, man, see ya later.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.092
Put it on. Let's see what...

04:57.094 --> 04:58.927
Let's see that Chewbacca impression.

04:58.929 --> 05:02.531
Having mask or no mask,
it's an awesome impression.

05:02.533 --> 05:03.532
How's it feel?

05:03.534 --> 05:04.933
How's it smell?

05:04.935 --> 05:07.069
Ugh, do I have to
stay in here any longer?

05:07.071 --> 05:08.170
All right, come on, let's hear it.

05:08.172 --> 05:10.105
All righty.

05:10.107 --> 05:12.608
[muffled screaming]

05:12.610 --> 05:14.243
It's a little better.

05:14.245 --> 05:16.445
The muffling does make
it sound a little better.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.247
[laughter]

05:18.249 --> 05:19.915
Take me there, take me.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.683
Don't close your eyes,
because the face is everything.

05:21.685 --> 05:22.718
Okay, I'm staring.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.886
[screaming weakly]

05:23.888 --> 05:25.554
[laughter]

05:25.556 --> 05:28.457
It's like Chewie being
stabbed to death in a subway.

05:28.459 --> 05:31.627
[laughter]

05:31.629 --> 05:32.961
Don Post mask.

05:32.963 --> 05:34.062
Yeah, we just picked it up.

05:34.064 --> 05:35.564
Wow, dude.

05:35.566 --> 05:37.232
The ultimate Chewbacca mask.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.434
- Did you hear my impression?
- I could hear you on the street.

05:39.436 --> 05:40.602
It was a Rob Bruce mating call.

05:40.604 --> 05:41.770
That's why he showed up so fast.

05:41.772 --> 05:43.605
It was pretty good, right?

05:43.607 --> 05:44.940
- Oh, it's terrible.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

05:44.942 --> 05:46.108
Oh, like you guys could do any better.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.409
I guarantee you all three of us

05:47.411 --> 05:49.077
could do a better Wookiee call than that.

05:49.079 --> 05:50.779
All right, well, let's hear you try.

05:50.781 --> 05:52.748
All right, well, how about
we let Robert then decide

05:52.750 --> 05:54.449
who's got the best Wookiee
call out of all of us?

05:54.451 --> 05:55.450
- Nah.
- I could do that for sure.

05:55.452 --> 05:56.618
- No way.
- Why?

05:56.620 --> 05:57.753
He's not an impartial judge.

05:57.755 --> 05:59.221
- No, yeah...
- Yes, he is.

05:59.223 --> 06:00.555
No way, you know he's gonna pick you

06:00.557 --> 06:01.623
because he knows you're the boss.

06:01.625 --> 06:02.624
Honest Rob.

06:02.626 --> 06:05.127
[laughter]

06:05.129 --> 06:07.129
Hey, if you guys really
wanted to do a contest,

06:07.131 --> 06:08.563
I know the perfect judge,

06:08.565 --> 06:09.965
and he would totally be impartial.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.233
Who?

06:11.235 --> 06:12.567
Peter Mayhew's gonna be in town.

06:12.569 --> 06:14.569
You're talking about the Peter Mayhew?

06:14.571 --> 06:15.671
Chewbacca himself?

06:15.673 --> 06:17.406
I've known Peter for years.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.074
And you think you could
convince him to come down here?

06:19.076 --> 06:20.976
You guys set it up, I'll have him here.

06:20.978 --> 06:23.111
Rob Bruce knows Peter
Mayhew from "Star Wars"?

06:23.113 --> 06:24.112
He knows him.

06:24.114 --> 06:25.781
He is the connect, man.

06:25.783 --> 06:27.316
I've been working in
this business 21 years.

06:27.318 --> 06:28.517
I don't even know Peter Mayhew.

06:28.519 --> 06:29.952
That's weird, because he goes by

06:29.954 --> 06:31.820
Peter "I'll be friends with anyone" Mayhew.

06:31.822 --> 06:33.956
[laughter]

06:33.958 --> 06:36.191
We all agree, Peter
Mayhew is qualified enough

06:36.193 --> 06:37.192
to judge our little contest?

06:37.194 --> 06:38.827
Yes, yes, yes, I agree.

06:38.829 --> 06:40.495
We'll go all out.

06:40.497 --> 06:42.831
We'll put on a little show
for the Wookiee man himself.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.032
What do you mean, like costumes?

06:44.034 --> 06:45.200
That's not a bad idea.

06:45.202 --> 06:46.468
Can we make our own?

06:46.470 --> 06:47.836
Our own interpretations of a Wookiee.

06:47.838 --> 06:49.104
Our Wookiee-off.

06:49.106 --> 06:50.372
How much do you want for that?

06:50.374 --> 06:53.108
[laughter]

06:53.110 --> 06:55.310
I need more room in the box itself.

06:55.312 --> 06:57.846
I'm gonna be putting my ashes in this.

06:57.848 --> 06:59.181
Gentlemen, he's coming.

06:59.183 --> 07:01.342
Mr. Peter Mayhew will be here.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.922
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, good. I'm Joe.

07:10.922 --> 07:13.602
I called earlier about the
Marvel superheroes lunch box.

07:13.908 --> 07:15.274
- Oh, yeah.
- That's right.

07:15.276 --> 07:16.475
- It's right down there.
- Oh, yeah.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.710
This is sweet.

07:24.284 --> 07:25.952
I actually had this
lunch box in fourth grade.

07:25.954 --> 07:28.154
- Me too, yeah.
- I just adored this lunch box.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.655
I imagine they must be pretty rare,

07:29.657 --> 07:31.590
because, like, when you guys had them,

07:31.592 --> 07:32.959
it was used to deflect,

07:32.961 --> 07:35.928
like, a flurry of punches coming your way.

07:35.930 --> 07:38.280
I think I had the coolest
lunch box of all, "Star Wars."

07:38.280 --> 07:39.363
Did you?

07:39.364 --> 07:41.513
- I had the "Star Wars" lunch box.
- Was it metal, though?

07:41.514 --> 07:44.636
'Cause eventually, lunch boxes
are phased from metal to...

07:44.639 --> 07:46.138
- Plastic.
- Blegh.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.406
- It was metal.
- Don't lie.

07:47.408 --> 07:48.841
It was a cardboard shoe box.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.776
He wrote "Star Wars" on the side.

07:50.778 --> 07:52.278
[laughter]

07:52.280 --> 07:54.113
Oh, my lord.

07:54.115 --> 07:55.581
The metal lunch box.

07:55.583 --> 07:57.783
The lunch box itself was not just metal,

07:57.785 --> 07:59.352
but it was a metal lunch box.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.820
You could take somebody out with it.

08:00.822 --> 08:02.421
Like, the playground was a series

08:02.423 --> 08:03.856
of, like, bam!

08:03.858 --> 08:05.257
Aah!

08:05.259 --> 08:07.626
It was just "Goodfellas"
over and over again.

08:07.628 --> 08:09.462
Open her up. It's got
the thermos in there.

08:09.464 --> 08:10.596
Oh, cool.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.602

08:16.604 --> 08:18.734
I'm gonna be putting my ashes in this.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.707

Your real... your body ashes.

to keep it on the mantel.

You know, how, like,
some couples, you know,

- About $50.

09:28.709 --> 09:30.209

09:30.211 --> 09:31.544

10:09.217 --> 10:10.649
A bandolier.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.551

already done means one thing.

I'd have some of my

12:29.211 --> 12:31.211
It was amazing. Which came first?

12:31.213 --> 12:32.545
- The toy.
- The toy.

12:32.547 --> 12:33.947
And then they made a
comic to sell the toy.

12:33.949 --> 12:35.715
I remember the ads in the comic book,

"I'm a big boy now. I

15:33.962 --> 15:35.762
- Killer t-shirt.
- I love it.

15:35.764 --> 15:38.531
So what was it like on the first film?

15:38.533 --> 15:40.266
Did you have any idea that it would

15:40.268 --> 15:41.901
change the lives of millions of people?

15:41.903 --> 15:46.940
I never expected it to
be any more than a B-movie.

15:46.942 --> 15:50.443
The first day, the costume felt strange.

15:50.445 --> 15:54.480
But, within two days,
we were in the cantina.

15:54.482 --> 15:56.950
And, boy, if you don't feel normal.

15:56.952 --> 15:58.551
[laughter]

15:58.553 --> 16:02.121
Because there's two heads and green people,

16:02.123 --> 16:03.823
you name it.

16:03.825 --> 16:04.991
I know you didn't fly it for real,

16:04.993 --> 16:06.593
but what was it like co-piloting,

16:06.595 --> 16:08.728
like, the baddest starships ever?

16:08.730 --> 16:10.296
Absolutely wonderful.

16:10.298 --> 16:12.098
It's like sitting in a sports car,

16:12.100 --> 16:16.102
and they've taken a piece of the Falcon out

16:16.104 --> 16:19.505
so that I could hang my feet underneath.

16:19.507 --> 16:20.773
Like Fred Flintstone.

16:20.775 --> 16:24.857
Yeah, good point.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.126
Chewie's noise was a brown bear

16:27.128 --> 16:29.529
and a German shepherd.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.197
You mix the two together.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.665
Can I run home and get my dog?

16:32.667 --> 16:35.802
[laughter]

16:35.804 --> 16:37.537
Okay, we're gonna get in our costumes,

16:37.539 --> 16:39.038
and we're gonna give you

16:39.040 --> 16:41.808
the best Wookiee call
contest you ever heard.

16:41.810 --> 16:44.310
Welcome to the Wookiee-off.

16:44.312 --> 16:45.778
Can we have your roar, please?

16:47.480 --> 16:50.648
[rock music]

16:51.446 --> 16:55.882
Welcome to the first annual Wookiee-off.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.284
Wookiees are individuals,

16:58.286 --> 17:03.389
and I can see there are
a lot of individuals here.

17:03.391 --> 17:08.527
Some wonderful, and some terrible.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.029
So it's the Wookiee-off,

17:10.031 --> 17:12.064
and not everybody looked as fly

17:12.066 --> 17:15.166
as maybe Bry, myself, or Mike.

17:15.169 --> 17:17.970
This tool decides that he would
go buy his costume on the Internet.

17:17.972 --> 17:19.405
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hold on.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.073
You step up in a plastic mask?

17:21.075 --> 17:22.575
Whoa, hold on.

17:22.577 --> 17:24.175
It wasn't a Wookiee look-alike contest.

17:24.178 --> 17:25.877
It was a Wookiee call contest.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.146
He... he's right.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.814
And it was time to step up to the plate

17:28.816 --> 17:31.767
and do our best Wookiee call.

17:32.020 --> 17:34.429
I think we'll start with number one.
