-That is a robbery in progress.

-Go.

constantly interrupting our alone time.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.329
I've never seen
anything like that in my life.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.608
- I want a gun like that.
-What happened out there?

12:00.760 --> 12:02.649

dropped precipitously.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.451

I'll be right back.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.042
Okay. So, we're up
against a guy with a futuristic rifle

12:14.200 --> 12:16.851
that steals jewelry
and looks like a pirate.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.240
(IN PIRATE VOICE) A pirate, right. Then,

12:18.400 --> 12:21.961
we shall call this scurvy lad
by the name of Plunder.

That's not my problem.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.607

Yeah, I just wanna show you something.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.004
Why do I feel like
I'm walking into a trap?

12:36.160 --> 12:40.484
Anyway, I'm gonna get CCPD to monitor
all the jewelry stores in the city.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.769
This guy must be pretty full of
himself knowing he escaped the Flash.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.843
- So ten to one, he'll be back.
-All right.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.162
When he is, we'll be ready for him,
though. Right, Barry?

12:48.320 --> 12:51.881
No, not we, Wally.
This... You're still training.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.204
Have you seen my times
in the Speed Lab lately?

12:54.360 --> 12:55.725
I'm almost as fast as you.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.921
Okay, this isn't about speed.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.048
This is about gaining
knowledge and experience.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.804
So please just trust me, all right?

13:08.840 --> 13:13.402
Look, I am as overprotective
a father as you can get,

13:14.560 --> 13:17.643
but I gotta be honest, Barr, I'm...
I agree with Wally.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.801
I don't know, Joe.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.407
Let's just see what else we can find
on this guy before we let Wally loose.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.449
Okay. Well, remember the best way
to teach somebody something

13:27.600 --> 13:30.649
is to throw them in the deep end.
That's how I taught you how to swim.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.245
That was...

13:32.400 --> 13:34.721
- I'm still mad about that.
-You can swim now, can't you?

13:35.680 --> 13:36.727
Yeah.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.327
Got your text.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.481
Hi. Come, take a seat.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.843
I know I was rude yesterday.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.162
Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.449
- Yeah, there is a reason.
-Because you are a world-class jerk?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.601
Fair enough.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.887
Listen, I've been trying really hard
not to think about my alter ego,

14:06.040 --> 14:07.201
about what he did.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.807
And seeing you,
it just brought it all back.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.649
Look, what Alchemy did was not your fault.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.801
Yeah.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.443
Tell that to Dave Frieman, to Ben Edwards,
Jorge Gonzales.

<i>These men were part of the

14:28.080 --> 14:29.809
I should have died, not them.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.646
Julian, what you're feeling,
it's completely normal.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.407
It's called survivor's guilt.
But it wasn't your fault, okay?

14:37.600 --> 14:40.490
You're a victim, too. I...

14:41.560 --> 14:44.848
I tortured people and
nearly killed my best friends.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.847
I didn't ask for these powers, just like
you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.561
Yeah.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.405
(EXHALES)
I just don't know how to move forward.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.201
Why don't you come
join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.330
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.481
- Being serious?
-Yeah.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.802
Barry and the team,
they'd be thrilled to have you.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.485
I would be thrilled to have you.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.441
Uh...

15:15.920 --> 15:16.967
I'll give it some thought.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.727
Thanks for coming.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.491
Well, I'm just so persuasive.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.246
As a matter of fact,
my partner on my Earth,

15:45.400 --> 15:46.890

- Didn't you just have one of those?
-Oh, yeah.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.089
Look, I gotta order
more parts for this thing.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.129
Yeah, no, go ahead. Price is no object.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.610
Hey. How's it going?

16:00.760 --> 16:04.401
You know, S.T.A.R. Labs Museum,

16:04.760 --> 16:05.761
- Okay.
-Barry, cappuccino.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.161
- Hi. I'm good. I'm sorry.
-Okay. All right.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.089
- You know I'll double down.
-Yeah, no. Sure.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.362
I just actually wanted to
ask you something about

16:12.520 --> 16:15.330
your scientific, romance novels.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.562
My novels? Yeah. Sure, please.
Have a seat.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.370
- Yeah, ask anything you want.
-Okay.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.522
- Any question. Yeah.
-Yeah? All right, cool.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.331
Um, I was just wondering if you've
ever written about time travel.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.801
More specifically,
traveling to the future.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.685
<i>No, my bestseller,
The Future Ain't What It Used to Be,</i>

16:29.880 --> 16:31.564

16:31.840 --> 16:37.051
it was all about this guy who's
actively trying to prevent his own murder.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.368
Won the Nebula Award.
it was well-received.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.846
- Wow.
-Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.447
So this character, your character,
was he able to change his future?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.565
More specifically, if he allowed
certain events to occur naturally,

16:47.720 --> 16:51.520
was he only cementing the very timeline
that resulted in a horrible event later?

16:51.680 --> 16:52.681
There were two schools of thought.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.330
One faction, one group of fans,

16:54.480 --> 16:56.244
they believe that the
future is ever-changing.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.050
You know, it's not fixed. And so,

16:58.240 --> 17:00.083
you could make of
the future anything you wish.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.241
Right.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.323
Another group of fans
vehemently disagreed with it.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.606
They said, "No, no, no.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.127
"The future is fixed, and you can't
change it, no matter how hard you try."

17:08.440 --> 17:09.441
Mmm-hmm.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.204
Where do you come down
on a fixed or ever-changing future?

17:13.359 --> 17:16.489
Well, I think that a man
often meets his destiny

17:16.680 --> 17:18.647
on the very road he takes to avoid it.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.648

that Barry's the Flash.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.969
I think we can give him a chance.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.884
Tell Julian
we'll think about it, all right?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.686
-Iris.
-Hey.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.246
I need to show you something.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.407
- I forgot this place existed.
-Yeah.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.211
The original Wells
used to call it his Time Vault.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.370
I've been coming down here a lot lately.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.804
I guess I've become as obsessed
with the future as he once was.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.171
After Flashpoint happened,
this article reappeared.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.281
"Flash missing,

24:09.360 --> 24:13.729
"vanishes in crisis. Julie Greer.
April 25th, 2024."

24:14.680 --> 24:17.445
The byline used to read,
"Iris West-Allen."

24:17.920 --> 24:19.524
The future's changed.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.285
So maybe I quit my job.

24:24.800 --> 24:28.600
Yeah, that's what I'd hoped at first, too,
or something. But, I...

24:31.920 --> 24:34.048
Iris, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you this sooner.

24:36.240 --> 24:39.562
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force,

24:39.840 --> 24:41.683
I accidentally ran to the future.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.964
I saw Savitar murder you.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.725
And I saw myself,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.084
and I wasn't fast enough to save you.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.163
Barry, no, I mean, we...

25:00.640 --> 25:01.801
We destroyed the Stone.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.122
- Savitar's gone, so...
-Maybe not.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.289
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe not.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.600
Is that why you keep having nightmares?
You keep seeing me.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.682
So, what does this
have to do with Plunder?

25:20.840 --> 25:24.049
He was already in jail in the future.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.170
So, I don't know.
I thought if I didn't catch him,

25:27.320 --> 25:31.120
that I could stop
the timeline from cementing.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.009
I could prevent your death. I don't know.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.164
Barry, you cannot stop
protecting the city to save me.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.321
Why?

25:37.800 --> 25:42.124
Why not? I'm sorry, one robber goes free,
it's that versus your life.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.204
Joe would want me to make the
exact same choice, Iris. He...

25:52.960 --> 25:54.007
Iris...

25:56.640 --> 25:59.450
- How long? (SOBS)
-How long what?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.250
How long until it happens?

26:02.800 --> 26:03.926
This is not gonna happen.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.803
Hey, look at me. This is not gonna happen.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.561
Jay said that your death is
just one possible future. Okay?

26:10.720 --> 26:13.326
So that gives us four months
to figure out how to stop Savitar.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.085
I swear on both my parents' lives,
I will protect you.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.604
We can't do this alone, Barry.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.529
Hey. guys. Um...

26:40.800 --> 26:42.131
Iris and I, um,

26:44.400 --> 26:46.528
we have something we need to tell you.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.090
So you're saying that
four months from now, Savitarwill...

26:54.240 --> 26:56.049
- Kill me.
-Possibly.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.521
It's okay, guys. I'm okay, really.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.447
- How are you gonna tell Dad?
-I'm not.

27:01.640 --> 27:02.880
Iris, he needs to know.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.247
I agree with Wallace. Joe needs to know.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.402
No. Guys, this news would blind him, okay?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.206
We all saw how crazy he went
when Wally was in danger.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.408
Imagine if he knew that
Savitar was trying to kill me.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.562
He would go after Savitar himself.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.887
Wally...

27:20.280 --> 27:23.170
The future isn't set. There's still hope.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.570
But, Barry, the future,

27:25.720 --> 27:27.404
it's harder to change
than you can imagine.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.005
The future wants to happen.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.605
The way it was explained to me was,

27:30.760 --> 27:32.922
imagine if you had
a row of dominoes, okay?

27:33.080 --> 27:34.923
Now, those dominoes are all set up.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.923
- And the... It's...
-Here.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.561
So convenient.
Yeah, give me them. Barry, if you...

27:42.080 --> 27:46.404
(SIGHS) So, imagine, okay, a domino.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.250
Each domino is a moment in time.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.686
One moment in time leads to the next.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.569
So as one domino falls, it hits the next,

27:51.720 --> 27:53.688
it hits the next, and the next,
and the next, and so on,

27:53.840 --> 27:56.525
leading to the inevitable conclusion.
And that is...

27:58.200 --> 27:59.406
The future.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.803
And what happens
if we alter certain events?

28:02.960 --> 28:05.247
Well, you could, conceivably,

28:05.920 --> 28:07.206
change where you end up.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.442
But, Barry, if you would--

28:11.240 --> 28:13.129
So, you could change the future.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.682
But you have to be
very careful about which events...

28:18.720 --> 28:19.846
You alter.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.811
We need to figure out everything
that happens leading up to Iris' death.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.450
Wait, when I saw the future,

28:29.640 --> 28:33.201
there was a news scroll on TV
I mean, that could offer us some clues.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.806
Absolutely. I think I can help with that.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.050
Hang on, McFly.
I'm about to vibe you back to the future.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.405
- Can you pass me the multi-meter, please?
-Yeah.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.726
- The multi-meter.
-Yeah.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.321
- The multi-meter.
-Yeah.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.489
I'm better with the tools of the scribe.
There it is.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.881
Are you sure your buddy Randolf
back home didn't just solve

28:58.040 --> 28:59.485
that cryptogram to get rid of you?

29:01.840 --> 29:02.841
Well, perhaps he did.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.486
Look, I came to
this Earth seeking redemption.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.604
But I realize now, you're right.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.843
Greatness isn't in the cards for me.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.447
Okay.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.531
So you failed.
So nobody came to your opening.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.446
Don't end it like this.
Greatness takes time.

29:26.960 --> 29:27.961
And you know this.

29:29.360 --> 29:33.046
"If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it."

29:33.680 --> 29:37.162
"Patience can do lots of things.
Have you ever tried it?"

29:43.880 --> 29:44.881
Right.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.530
- BARRY: Hey, guys. You ready?
-Yeah.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.051
CISCO: Yeah, we're ready.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.804
The machine's souped up and ready to go.

29:49.960 --> 29:51.689
It's gonna be a hell of a vibe.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.927
All you have to do is just sit back,
relax, or, well, try to relax.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.521
And concentrate, really focus,

29:59.680 --> 30:02.809
on the exact date
in the future that you traveled to.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.687

Your theory is correct.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.601
You're ready.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.367
Far more ready than I was when I started.
What do you say?

33:35.480 --> 33:36.641
- I'm in.
-All right.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.200
Plunder, my man,

-I'm good, dude. You can have this one.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.607
- No, Wally, this one has to be you.
-Why?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.286
Because if you take down Plunder,

34:37.440 --> 34:40.011
the news report that says that
I captured him in the future, it's wrong.

We can prove that
we can alter the future, here and now.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.210

34:45.360 --> 34:47.203
I sent you out here because you're a hero.

I mean, my last team,
they were all murdered by Savitar. So...

39:45.840 --> 39:47.842
We need to work on your small talk skills.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.923
Yeah, sure. Just wanted to be upfront.

Thank you.

I have to admit,
I missed you around the house.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.011
- Yeah?
-But“

40:05.160 --> 40:07.845
Wally over there keeps me plenty occupied.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.210
Yeah, I already talked to Wally,
but I'm sorry about yesterday.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.681
You were right.
He's really important to this team.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.761
He's a real hero, Joe.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.325
Both my sons are heroes.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.005
Julian and I were talking about
your battery problem with your cuffs.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.808
We decided we'd invest
in an alternate accessory.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.121
J U LIAN: Voilà.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.246

Guys, this means so much to me. Thank you.

40:51.880 --> 40:56.841
Hi, guys. I asked myself
to say a few words on this occasion.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.771
A home, you know,
more than bricks and mortar,

41:00.040 --> 41:02.327
and a turtle, it's a feeling.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.724
It's a feeling of belonging, isn't it?

41:04.880 --> 41:08.851
Of love, of course.
Of hope for the future.

41:09.840 --> 41:13.367
I don't know if I have ever met two people

41:13.520 --> 41:16.330
who are more suited
to one another than you two.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.081
To Barry and Iris.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.330
- Barry and Iris.
-To Barry and Iris.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.481
