01:23.100 --> 01:24.100
What the...?

01:24.100 --> 01:26.100
What are you doing?

01:26.100 --> 01:28.361
I don't know something
doesn't feel quite right

01:28.361 --> 01:28.861
Why what's wrong?

01:30.220 --> 01:33.120
Its getting worse - got
to pull over I think

01:46.240 --> 01:47.760
Sorry.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.320
That's just great isn't it? We finally get to have a nice
romantic weekend away and we break down it's typical.

01:53.050 --> 01:54.579
Yeah, what do you do now?

01:54.579 --> 01:55.619
Let's take a look

02:07.580 --> 02:10.419
Rory looks okay to me just
just looks like a flat tire

02:11.870 --> 02:14.739
Okay, so what do you do now? Call someone?

02:16.610 --> 02:19.089
If this tire's okay, we
can just change it over

02:20.900 --> 02:22.900
Here we'll need this

02:24.380 --> 02:26.380
Take it

02:26.810 --> 02:28.460
Saff how do you know all this?

02:28.460 --> 02:31.060
How do you not know all this?

02:32.660 --> 02:34.660
I don't have to - I've got you.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
What would you do without me?

03:08.190 --> 03:10.291
It looked a lot better on the website.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.969
Yeah, things always look
a bit better online, but

03:15.330 --> 03:17.719
It's alright, though. It's nice, isn't it?

03:33.420 --> 03:35.420
Saff, you're so predictable

03:35.420 --> 03:37.230
What? Why?

03:37.230 --> 03:38.610
Because every time we go away

03:38.610 --> 03:44.540
First thing you do is look in the bathroom and I can guarantee
the last thing you're gonna do before we leave you'll steal all

03:44.540 --> 03:46.290
those little toiletries

03:46.290 --> 03:47.620
They're complimentary!

03:47.980 --> 03:51.640
It's not stealing if they're free.
Anyway, you're the one who's predictable

03:51.980 --> 03:52.720
What? How's that?

03:53.240 --> 03:55.740
What do you predict I'm
gonna do tonight, then?

03:55.740 --> 03:56.629
I'll tell you exactly what
you're gonna do tonight -

03:56.630 --> 04:02.510
We're gonna go out you're gonna get really drunk get lost
you'll refuse to look up the directions on your phone

04:03.060 --> 04:09.290
We'll eventually find our way back here and then
you'll fall immediately asleep and snore loudly

04:10.770 --> 04:13.609
Okay. Well that is pretty much what
I've done every time we've been away

04:16.290 --> 04:18.259
You never know I might
just surprise you yet.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.309
See - I know you too well

04:20.430 --> 04:23.630
Anyway, like to get changed to
anything or shall we just head out?

04:24.780 --> 04:25.280
Let's go and have some fun.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.780

We can't pretend last
night just didn't happen

13:04.580 --> 13:09.670
Look we have to tell somebody they're gonna get away

55:37.530 --> 55:40.489
What do you want, what
are you gonna do to me?

55:42.540 --> 55:44.810
I've thought about what
I'd do when I found you

55:46.110 --> 55:48.110
If I found you

55:49.050 --> 55:51.050
For a long time

55:52.200 --> 55:54.200
But now

55:55.319 --> 55:57.319
I don't know...

55:59.190 --> 56:01.190
I get it

56:01.190 --> 56:03.190
You want revenge

56:03.190 --> 56:05.190
Eye for an eye

56:05.190 --> 56:07.190
What goes around comes around

56:07.190 --> 56:09.190
I fucking deserve it, I deserve it, I know

56:11.400 --> 56:13.400
Do what you have to do

56:16.739 --> 56:18.739
Part of me would would like to

56:19.950 --> 56:22.283
But its not in me. I hate violence.

56:22.283 --> 56:25.549
It took a lot for me to hit you back there
- I mean

56:26.069 --> 56:28.939
I've never even been in a fight
before never thrown a punch

56:32.960 --> 56:36.319
To be honest with you, I don't know...

56:36.860 --> 56:38.860
I don't know what I'm doing here

56:45.380 --> 56:49.000
I'm truly. Sorry. I wanna put this right

56:50.849 --> 56:54.919
Thank you, I mean you seem
like an alright guy...

58:27.720 --> 58:29.720
Okay

58:33.360 --> 58:35.360
What do we do now

58:38.680 --> 58:40.680
Call the police... we'll do it together...

58:47.940 --> 58:49.940
We can't - she didn't want...

58:52.040 --> 58:54.080
Saff didn't want anyone to know

58:57.990 --> 59:03.679
That's why I'm here that's
why I've gotta do this

59:14.340 --> 59:19.519
I'm sorry. I know this is wrong...

59:24.900 --> 59:30.169
Don't wanna do this, but I have to

59:33.330 --> 59:35.710
I don't have any choice

59:35.710 --> 59:38.090
I don't have any choice

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.940
Hi mate!

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.960
Wonder if you can help me I'm lost

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.190
Where are you trying to get to?

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:38.930
My car parked in the carpark
of a farm somewhere but

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.029
There's plenty of farms around here. It's
probably up there. That's the closest

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.470
Over there over

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:14.800
There where that bird-watching thing
is there's a road it'll be there

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:27.040
Okay, thanks I'll check up there

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.880
Hold on - you're that bloke from -

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.508
What you doing what the fuck you doing

01:04:48.508 --> 01:04:50.234
I'm doing what needs to be done

01:04:50.234 --> 01:04:52.740
You're that bloke from
Blackpool, aren't you?

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:57.220
Yeah, do you remember me? Do you
remember her? Do you remember Saffy?

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.559
That was Glenn and Becca? That wasn't me?

01:04:58.559 --> 01:05:00.400
That wasn't me.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.841
Let me guess. You tried to stop them?

01:05:01.841 --> 01:05:02.860
No, I didn't, no.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.360
What did you do then?

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.480
I just stood I just froze
just stood and watched

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.540
You watched! You fucking watched?!

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.098
I know I wish I'd done something

01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:12.809
I wish I'd done something to
stop it and that was wrong

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:18.209
But I just wanted make it better so I can sleep again.
We could talk about it. Let's talk wait wait you want?

01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:22.819
It it's not about what I want anymore.
We're way past what I want!

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:26.788
Right now, right now, it's
about what I have to do

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:41.710
Look at me

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:43.710
I'm sorry

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.460

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:57.330

Both of whom aren't on their way because

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.660
Dead

I swear we've never done anything like this before
we were boozed up, on the coke, on the pills

01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:13.229
It just, it all got out
of hand, but that girl -

01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:14.540
Her name was Sapphire

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.540
No please!

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:19.830
Sapphire said please in that video
didn't she but you didn't stop

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:22.580
So why should I?

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.210
If you do this, then
you're just as bad as us

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:29.580
No, wait, you're worse than us -we were off our
heads. We didn't know what we were doing I swear!

01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:33.870
Please just think about it -
two wrongs don't make a right

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.520
Think about it

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.600
Think about her

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:06.280

What the fuck is going on here?

01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:35.740
You've got the wrong guy

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:36.670
No, I haven't

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.159

01:21:39.159 --> 01:21:39.790

I'm sorry, whatever this is -

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.340
Get on your fucking knees now!

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.440

I'll tell you what this is about

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960
This is about Sapphire Ford

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.310
She was soon to be Sapphire Campbell

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.780
But she fucking died as Sapphire Ford!

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.300
She's dead

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.089

It's not gonna bring her back

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.537
It's not gonna make you feel any better.
I can tell you that much.

01:22:46.537 --> 01:22:48.250
It's gonna get you banged up

01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:54.610
I'm getting married

01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:56.610
