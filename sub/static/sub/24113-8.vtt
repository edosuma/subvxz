Well, that's not very nice,

03:15.080 --> 03:16.500

I was a desperate kid.

03:28.830 --> 03:30.880
Pay no mind to him, Alexander.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.380
The only reason
I became your parabatai

03:33.380 --> 03:36.170
was to make sure there was
a roof over my head.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.420

You almost killed her!

03:53.540 --> 03:54.830
Ooh!

03:54.830 --> 03:56.330
She gave herself up to the Clave
trying to protect you!

03:56.330 --> 03:58.790
Still jealous she picked
me over you, huh?

03:58.790 --> 04:01.580
By the way, that kiss

04:01.580 --> 04:03.210
at the Seelie Court...

04:03.210 --> 04:04.790
we never got to compare notes.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.670
Let me in there!
I'll throw you off a building!

04:06.670 --> 04:08.250
Come on! Come on, Simon.

04:09.790 --> 04:12.040
The Jace in that trap
is not our Jace.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.330
We need to focus.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.420
All right? If the Clave
finds out about Clary's wish

04:15.420 --> 04:17.170
to Raziel, we might
never see her again.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.540
All right. Do we
have anybody in Idris

04:21.540 --> 04:22.750
that can get us information?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.460
Well, we stole
from the Clave's armory.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.620
So if they've figured
that out...

04:25.620 --> 04:27.460
They're not gonna
tell us anything.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.330
So what's plan B?

04:28.330 --> 04:30.790
I'm gonna try to get
some more intel on Clary.

04:30.790 --> 04:32.040
The best thing you can do?

04:32.040 --> 04:33.460
Go back to that
abandoned building

04:33.460 --> 04:34.540
and see if you can
find some clues.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.710
No! I'm not going
on a demon hunt

04:35.710 --> 04:36.830
while my best friend
is in prison!

04:36.830 --> 04:40.460
Simon... Clary risked
everything to save Jace.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.170
You want to do
something for her?

04:42.170 --> 04:44.620
Help destroy the demon
that caused all this mess.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.880
But I want to know as soon
as you hear anything.

04:49.880 --> 04:50.880
You got it.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.790
Hey. No one can find out

04:52.790 --> 04:54.120
about Jace's possession.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.380
If Clary's able to keep
a lid on her wish,

04:55.380 --> 04:56.460
we can't blow it.

05:01.580 --> 05:02.880
Speaking of Jace...

05:02.880 --> 05:04.580
we need to talk.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.330
Now, If we wanna
bring Jace back,

05:14.330 --> 05:15.540
we have to get through to him

05:15.540 --> 05:17.420
using the strongest
connection possible.

05:18.540 --> 05:19.580
Which is me.

05:21.540 --> 05:24.000
I'm in. Whatever it takes.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.170
I don't think you understand.

05:26.170 --> 05:27.500
This isn't like the last time

05:27.500 --> 05:29.620
we tried to use your parabatai
connection to help Jace.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.170
If you go in,

05:31.170 --> 05:33.750
Lilith could get her demonic
claws into your soul as well.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.500
I have to do this.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.500
Of course.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.290
But if I help you

05:41.290 --> 05:43.580
and I lose you...

05:43.580 --> 05:45.420
I know.

05:47.290 --> 05:48.380
It's just if...

05:48.380 --> 05:50.460
If I don't get Jace back, I...

05:50.460 --> 05:53.210
Without him, I'm...

05:53.210 --> 05:54.500
I'm nothing.

05:56.670 --> 05:58.330
Then we'll do this.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.250
But you're not going alone.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.460
So I can go with Alec
to save Jace,

06:08.460 --> 06:09.670
even though I'm not
his parabatai?

06:09.670 --> 06:12.540
It's possible, but it
would require more magic

06:12.540 --> 06:14.170
and give you
less time inside.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.540
No. I'll take the chance,

06:15.540 --> 06:17.080
but I'm not putting Izzy
in that kind of danger.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.460
The last time you tried to use
your parabatai connection,

06:19.460 --> 06:21.670
you were in a coma
and almost died.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.500
Jace was the only person
who could save you.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.380
And this time we won't
have him to bring you back.

06:28.540 --> 06:29.960
What exactly do we have to do?

06:29.960 --> 06:32.580
You have to find Jace
and bring him out with you.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.580
How?
When you find him,

06:34.580 --> 06:36.290
you all have to be linked.

06:36.290 --> 06:39.000
Now, I'll have one shot
to pull you all out together.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.620
So it's settled.

06:41.620 --> 06:42.880
Let's go bring back our brother.

Does Jace know? I tried

He must be worried.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.420

You know Jace.

to bring up--

11:33.830 --> 11:35.750
My competition? Please.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.170
I was over Robert long before
he started straying.

11:39.170 --> 11:40.670
She's actually a decent woman.

11:40.670 --> 11:43.000
She can help. It's worth a try.

Go.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.380
I'll get this done.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.880
Maryse...

11:53.880 --> 11:54.710
Thank you.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.880
Hey, what are the chances
I could get a beer in here?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.120
None. Let's go.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.580
You guys were always
the smart ones in the family.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.580
You really think you can
save Jace from Lilith?

12:14.580 --> 12:18.120
I don't know how long
I can maintain the connection.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.830
So find Jace as soon
as possible.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.500
Why do you wanna save Jace?

12:23.500 --> 12:24.880
He's your main competition.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.830
Hmm.
You may share your bed with him,

12:26.830 --> 12:28.620
but if your precious Alexander

12:28.620 --> 12:30.920
could only have one of us,
who do you think he'd pick?

12:30.920 --> 12:32.750
Shut up.
It's OK. He's just

12:32.750 --> 12:34.790
trying to distract us. Focus.

12:36.460 --> 12:38.290
Oh, yeah. Whatever you do,
don't lose focus.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.330
You know,
your boyfriend's right.

12:56.330 --> 12:57.960
Focus is the key.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.750
Jace?
He's doing it on purpose.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.380
Yes, to prevent us
from entering his mind.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.000
We have
to find another way.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.420
I have an idea.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.040
Portal me to the Institute.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.750
Why were you digging up
your father's body?

13:25.750 --> 13:26.830
I wasn't.

13:26.830 --> 13:28.540
Then who was?

13:32.420 --> 13:33.580
It was Jace.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.120
Jace Herondale?

13:35.120 --> 13:37.250
Then why did we find you

13:37.250 --> 13:38.500
in the cemetery?

13:39.500 --> 13:41.960
Because I helped him escape.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.960
Why was Jace
digging up Valentine?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.750
I don't know.

13:48.750 --> 13:53.460
Did Jace kill Imogen?

13:59.960 --> 14:02.120
I think so.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.750
Why would Jace kill
the only true family he has?

14:06.750 --> 14:10.250
He's not in control
of what he's doing.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.620
Why?

14:16.040 --> 14:17.790
Why?

14:17.790 --> 14:20.080
Because he's been possessed
by the Queen of Edom.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.830
How did that happen?

14:40.040 --> 14:40.880
Music, anyone?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.880
Yes.
No.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.880
OK.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.000
Hey, do you want my jacket?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.290
You can totally have my jacket.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.790
I'm fine.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.670
Sorry, are you cold?

14:55.670 --> 14:57.880
I don't feel temperature,
so sometimes I forget.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.120
I said I'm fine.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.460
I am so sorry. I just
remembered how cold

15:02.460 --> 15:04.040

used to get. Yeah.

We're not gonna let you use it

15:41.750 --> 15:42.750
to hurt our brother.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.080
And now you think
this can hold me?

15:46.080 --> 15:47.170
Valentine used them

15:47.170 --> 15:49.040
to hold an Angel for 25 years.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.040
I'm no Angel.

nothing can change that.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.170
We're in the Institute.

Jace!

This was the night Mom and Dad

17:31.290 --> 17:32.710
went on mission in Geneva

17:32.710 --> 17:34.420
and we snuck downstairs

I don't know. He didn't
disappear with the memory,

He was vulnerable.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.580

Because Valentine

Since the time
of Jonathan Shadowhunter,

22:21.960 --> 22:23.880
we have battled demons
with the reassurance

that if an insurmountable evil
were to take over the world,

22:27.710 --> 22:30.500
the Angel's wish could save us.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.420
You've taken that away.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.620
To you, an insurmountable evil

22:39.620 --> 22:41.540
is a world overrun by demons.

22:41.540 --> 22:44.000
To me, it's the mass murder

22:44.000 --> 22:45.960
of all creatures
with demon blood.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.790
Any wish that has the power

22:47.790 --> 22:49.580
to cause that kind
of destruction

22:49.580 --> 22:50.960
is not a gift.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.420
It's a curse.

23:31.170 --> 23:33.500
There's a wolf pack
in the Brocelind Forest.

23:33.500 --> 23:34.750
I'll head over
the mountains to Idris

23:34.750 --> 23:36.330
and enlist their help.

23:36.330 --> 23:37.620
You know better than anyone

23:37.620 --> 23:39.170
the Brocelind wolves are feral.

23:39.170 --> 23:40.790
They can't be trusted.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.330
The last thing Clary needs

23:45.330 --> 23:49.120
is to lose the only real father
she's ever had.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.830
I've already lost Jocelyn.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.620
I'm not losing Clary too.

Well, I guess if you're
the Queen of Hell,

24:14.620 --> 24:16.250
this place feels like home.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.040
Just stay with me in case
we run into any company.

24:26.540 --> 24:27.500
Is that salt?

24:28.620 --> 24:30.250
Yeah, this was me.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.380
So you blasted
Lilith's henchmen into salt?

24:37.380 --> 24:39.750
Not on purpose. This thing
just goes into...

24:39.750 --> 24:41.290
high gear around demons,
I guess.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.790
I smell blood.

24:45.790 --> 24:47.670
I do too.
Lots of it.

24:47.670 --> 24:48.670
But it's not normal.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.500
Wow...

25:03.500 --> 25:04.880
Is there a scent you can
pick up to track?

25:05.920 --> 25:08.710
I wish, but this isn't
from just one person.

25:08.710 --> 25:10.710
Yeah, I'm getting
a mix of like, 20.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.170
Maybe more.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.500
So what's this for?

25:15.670 --> 25:17.920
I don't know, but...
