00:34.399 --> 00:36.558
KNOCK ON DOOR

00:37.679 --> 00:40.079
VICTOR: Come in! It's open!

00:40.079 --> 00:42.159
Greetings, old pal.

00:42.159 --> 00:45.039
Right back at you, old chumerino.

00:46.159 --> 00:48.439
Clansman? Oh, yes.

00:48.439 --> 00:51.119
My mouth's all shaped for a pint.
How was Corby?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.239
Oh, Corby? Aye, it was OK.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.760
That's my cousin planted now.

00:55.759 --> 00:58.000
Very poor turnout at the funeral,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.479
but by all accounts,
she was an auld bastard anyway.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.599
Still, that's the estate sorted.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.840
She had an estate?
No, she lived on an estate.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.719
I was just handing the keys
back to the council.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.039
Did she leave you anything?

01:09.040 --> 01:12.200
Eh...naw.

01:16.599 --> 01:19.280
So, are we going for a pint,
or what? Yep.

01:20.519 --> 01:22.319
What have you done tae your face?

01:22.319 --> 01:26.919
Oh, this? Nothing.
Just...mixing it up a bit.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.320
So I go away for a fortnight
and I come back

01:29.319 --> 01:31.319
and you've went into
the fried chicken business?

01:31.319 --> 01:34.479
Shut up. I know this looks good.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.160
Have you got a bird?
Gimme peace.

01:37.159 --> 01:39.799
Have you got a wee chicken, then,
deep-fried?

01:39.799 --> 01:42.359
Victor, a man does not
squeeze a beard out

01:42.359 --> 01:44.079
or no reason whatsoever.

01:44.079 --> 01:46.719
What is it you're up to?
Take a look at this.

01:51.519 --> 01:53.839
Oh, aye. That's Derek Bedford.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.079
Used to be in Crossroads.
Then he retired.

01:57.079 --> 02:00.560
Then he got to be the cover guy
on the Twilight Monthly magazine.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.439
Gets tae travel all over the world
getting his photographs taken,

02:03.439 --> 02:06.439
flies everywhere for free,
goes holidays, goes shark fishing,

02:06.439 --> 02:10.199
eats wherever he likes, and he looks
a million dollars into the bargain.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.039
Wow, Jack. You know a lot about him.
Er, aye. I do, aye.

02:14.039 --> 02:16.280
It's no a jealousy thing.
Hmm.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.879
Lucky bastard!

02:17.879 --> 02:20.079
Aye. Well, his luck's ran out.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.999
He was jet-skiing in Barbados.
His steering got locked.

02:23.998 --> 02:27.918
Couldnae turn it, could he? They
found him 14 miles off the coast.

02:27.919 --> 02:30.159
Deid? Cooked.

02:30.159 --> 02:31.799
He looked like a Peperami.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.439
Oh, that's terrible.
He'll be sorely missed.

02:36.439 --> 02:39.359
Aye, he will indeed.
So that's why I've got the beard.

02:39.359 --> 02:42.439
Because you think you can replace
Derek Bedford as the Twilight guy?

02:42.439 --> 02:44.240
They're looking at people just now.

02:44.240 --> 02:47.680
There's a form to be filled in,
photies to be sent, an interview.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.159
This time, they want a couple -
appeal to the auld dames an' all.

02:51.159 --> 02:53.439
I want that gig, Jack.

02:53.439 --> 02:56.558
Naw. Nae offence, Victor. I mean,
you're a decent-looking bloke,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.080
but you're gonnae need more than
a daft beard to swing that gig.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.880
CLEARS HIS THROAT

03:06.159 --> 03:07.639
CLEARS HIS THROAT

03:09.080 --> 03:10.920
Is that a shark's tooth?

03:10.919 --> 03:13.519
I believe it is. Oxfam. Â£1.99.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.799
Here, press the lift while I just
put this away in the cupboard.

03:27.159 --> 03:28.799
It's Hawaii 75-0.

03:30.879 --> 03:32.960
MEENA, TRANSLATED:

03:37.879 --> 03:39.879
When hell freezes over.

03:39.879 --> 03:42.280
You've seen the stock numbers.
Stuff's going missing.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.000
Besides, it's always been
two at a time.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.639
It was two at a time for my father,

03:46.639 --> 03:48.439
and two at a time
for his father before him.

03:50.039 --> 03:51.759
OK, four at a time.

03:51.759 --> 03:52.959
Sorry, Father.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.440
DOOR BUZZES

03:56.439 --> 03:58.120
One, two, three.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.879
Meena, you only let in three.

04:03.879 --> 04:05.840
You buying anything?

04:06.960 --> 04:08.480
Naw.

04:08.479 --> 04:11.399
You've been in here before,
haven't you? Maybe.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.079
Mmm. And as far as I recall,
you've never bought anything.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.998
Nice recall.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.759
Not as much as a flying saucer.
They're for spacemen.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.959
Have you got a name?
They call me...the Lone Wolf.

04:24.959 --> 04:27.759
And why would they call you
the Lone Wolf?

04:27.759 --> 04:29.959
Because I work alone.
Mm-hm.

04:29.959 --> 04:31.719
And...I'm going to wolf these!

04:31.720 --> 04:34.440
HOWLS LIKE A WOLF

04:35.959 --> 04:38.120
MEENA: Navid!

04:38.120 --> 04:40.319
Haw! Haw!

04:45.680 --> 04:46.879
MEOW

04:46.879 --> 04:51.360
Oh, there ye are.
The Littlest Hobo, in cat form.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.960
Oh!

04:57.439 --> 05:00.399
There you go, wee fellow-me-lad.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.800
Here, you, this is none of
your semi-skimmed shite.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.000
This is the good, good gear.
Gold Top.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.279
Turn you into a lovely wee fat cat.
Come on, get it scuttled.

05:15.279 --> 05:17.479
MEOWS

05:22.800 --> 05:25.400
Eh...morning, Joe.

05:25.399 --> 05:26.879
Oh, morning, Winston.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.120
What are ye doing?
I'm giving the wee cat some scran.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.079
I've got a saucer of milk
up the stair for it.

05:38.079 --> 05:39.919
Oh, put it in yer tea.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.439
Because he prefers
something mair substantial.

05:42.439 --> 05:44.800
See that wee stray?

05:44.800 --> 05:49.199
I've given it love, attention,
succour.

05:49.199 --> 05:51.879
Aye, well, looks like
you're the sucker,

05:51.879 --> 05:54.279
cos he's clearly moved on fae milk.

05:54.279 --> 05:57.319
Haven't ye, Toby, son?

05:57.319 --> 05:59.519
Toby? His name's Bob!

06:02.600 --> 06:05.600
So the cat's a good fit for me, see?

06:05.600 --> 06:09.160
I don't have to walk it,
cos a cat's no a dug.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.800
A cat's no a dug?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.520
Thank you for stopping by

06:13.519 --> 06:16.000
and clearing that up for us,
Mr Attenborough.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.678
I'll tell ye something else -
a budgie's no a tortoise.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.478
ALL LAUGH
Shut up.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.920
My point is, the cat's a good fit
for Joe, as well,

06:23.920 --> 06:26.359
cos he needs the companionship.

06:26.358 --> 06:28.998
This is a battle I'm no losing.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.240
What's the wee cat's name?
Well, that's the thing.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.160
You see, he's called it Toby,
but I've called it Bob.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.880
Oh, thanks very much, Winston.
You've named the cat after me?

06:38.879 --> 06:42.079
If I named the cat after you,
it would be called Boabby -

06:42.079 --> 06:45.120
Boabby the Cat -
which is a sexual offence.

06:47.519 --> 06:50.120
Aw, look who it is -

06:50.120 --> 06:53.000
Sean Connery and his wee pal...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.639
Odd Job.

06:55.879 --> 06:59.120
Well, there's your Goldfinger
for you. Two pints, prick.

07:03.439 --> 07:07.040
ALL SNIGGER

07:07.040 --> 07:08.680
Right...

07:10.600 --> 07:12.920
..let's be having it, then.
Who's first?

07:14.120 --> 07:17.800
You look like
an anorexic Captain Birdseye.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.680
You look like a junkie Kenny Rogers.

07:21.839 --> 07:25.159
You look like
a Kentucky Fried wanker.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.360
I've covered chicken, Boabby.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.399
You look like Harold Shipman
going his holidays.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.520
So, what's with the beard?
Have you heard of Derek Bedford?

07:38.519 --> 07:41.799
Oh, aye, the sporty pensioner
off the front of the magazine.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.600
Aye. Well, he's deid.
VICTOR: Mm-hm.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.840
And they're coming to Glesga
and they're looking for a new guy.

07:46.839 --> 07:48.719
And he thinks he's the new guy.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.480
I think you'll find
I am the new guy.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.640
You no gonnae give it a go, Jack?

07:53.639 --> 07:56.199
Give this lanky streak of pish
a run for his money, eh?

07:56.199 --> 07:58.560
Aye, he could be standing there
with the surfboard

07:58.560 --> 07:59.879
and you can be the beach baw.

08:02.279 --> 08:04.719
No, no, it's...no for me,

08:04.720 --> 08:07.240
all that posing in front of
magazines, and that.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.079
Naw, that's the pursuit of the vain.

08:10.519 --> 08:13.479
Anyway, you shut up. "Beach baw."

08:13.480 --> 08:15.720
Aw, good for you, Victor.
What do you have to do?

08:15.720 --> 08:18.880
Ach, you just fill a form out,
you know, send your photie in.

08:18.879 --> 08:21.800
They're looking for a woman
an' all. ISA: Are they?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.920
Oh, I might throw my hat
in the ring.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.319
Oh, it can be you and me, Victor,
right there on the front cover.

08:29.319 --> 08:33.000
Boabby, do you have an electric
razor behind the counter there?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.039
The beard's coming aff.

08:35.039 --> 08:39.318
I think you look smashing
with that beard, Victor.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.679
Maybe I could be your beach gal.

08:43.679 --> 08:46.319
Make that an open razor, Boabby.
The beard's staying.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.640
The wrists are getting it.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.759
What do cats like?

08:53.759 --> 08:57.039
Er, shagging,
licking their bits, and sleeping.

08:57.039 --> 08:59.480
No, to eat.
You haven't got a cat.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.000
No' yet, but I will have soon. I
need something a cat cannae resist.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.039
You want these.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.040
Purries - guaranteed
to drive a cat to ecstasy.

09:12.039 --> 09:13.759
It's crack for cats.

09:13.759 --> 09:16.639
It's really only dried-out,
mashed-up fish guts,

09:16.639 --> 09:18.679
but it drives them aff their nut.

09:18.679 --> 09:21.559
Two packs, please.
Get behind the beads.

09:21.559 --> 09:23.039
Huh? Behind the beads!

09:45.360 --> 09:48.159
Ah, the Lone Wolf.

09:48.159 --> 09:50.679
You appear to have wandered
into the lion's den.

09:50.679 --> 09:52.319
There will be no more pilfering.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.080
Hear my roar!

09:55.080 --> 09:58.400
That disnae sound like a lion.
That sounds more like a big pussy.

09:58.399 --> 10:01.679
Cornered, hurling insults.

10:01.679 --> 10:05.439
Not a wolf, but merely a cub.
Put my gear back.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.080
HOWLS LIKE A WOLF

10:20.080 --> 10:23.680
Lion, by Christ.
Clarence, The Cross-Eyed Lion!

10:24.840 --> 10:27.320
CAT TREATS SCATTERING

10:30.799 --> 10:33.959
Come on, wee Bob.
Come and get your fix.

10:35.039 --> 10:39.519
Chicken and liver - irresistible.

10:39.519 --> 10:42.600
You're a bastard, Joe.
I want that cat.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.159
That cat wants me.

10:44.159 --> 10:46.000
That cat cannae live wi' you.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.960
One wrong turn in that buggy of
yours and he'd be roadkill.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.720
Oh, aye? And what are you gonnae do?

10:52.720 --> 10:55.360
Let it use yer leg
as a scratching post?

10:57.039 --> 10:59.519
Has that cat ever been
inside your house?

10:59.519 --> 11:02.079
No' yet. Has it ever been
inside yours?

11:02.080 --> 11:05.280
Naw. So, here's what I'm proposing.

11:05.279 --> 11:07.279
The first person to get wee Bob...

11:07.279 --> 11:10.559
Toby.
Bob, Toby, Toby, Bob. Shut up!

11:11.639 --> 11:16.559
Whoever's hoose that cat
chooses to enter is the victor,

11:16.559 --> 11:19.319
and the loser fits a catflap
for the winner.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.920
You hear that, Toby?

11:21.919 --> 11:23.799
We're getting a catflap.

11:23.799 --> 11:25.000
MEOWS

11:28.879 --> 11:32.720
Oh-ho! Look who it is -
our man in Havana.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.040
Well, I'm havana lager.

11:35.039 --> 11:36.599
Two...

11:36.600 --> 11:38.399
One pint, prick.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.920
Still gunning for that
magazine job, eh? Correct.

11:43.919 --> 11:47.360
Nae offence, Victor, but you look
like Jeremy Corbyn's idiot cousin.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.560
You've nae chance.

11:49.559 --> 11:51.039
Nae offence, like.

11:51.039 --> 11:52.439
All taken.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.320
Where's Jackie-boy?

11:55.320 --> 11:58.280
He's away into the toon.
He'll be here directly.

11:58.279 --> 11:59.399
CLEARS HIS THROAT

12:11.519 --> 12:13.159
Hello, Victor.

12:13.159 --> 12:15.759
You couldnae see green cheese, Isa,
could ye?

12:15.759 --> 12:18.240
How do you mean?
Don't start.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.960
You're done up like a fish supper!

12:19.960 --> 12:23.920
Och, well, what's the harm in it?
They're looking for a woman as well.

12:23.919 --> 12:26.479
And I'm no the only one
making an effort.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.240
And what job are you applying for?

12:39.240 --> 12:40.919
Coco the bastardin' clown?

12:42.279 --> 12:44.759
I'll see you on the beach.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.639
Well, this is just dandy,
isn't it, eh?

12:49.639 --> 12:54.240
You try to do something, get
the pish ripped out of ye for it,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.480
and then everybody
jumps on the bandwagon.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.680
Well, you know who your friends are,
eh?

13:09.240 --> 13:11.240
Evening, Victor.
Hello, Jack.

13:12.799 --> 13:15.240
Hi, Tam. Hi, Shug.
Hi, Jack.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.160
What is it?

13:19.679 --> 13:22.879
You no taking your bunnet aff?
Nah.

13:24.159 --> 13:25.639
Take your bunnet aff.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.639
Nah, I'm feeling it a bit cold
in here, actually.

13:28.639 --> 13:30.960
Jack...

13:33.519 --> 13:37.319
Nah.
Take your bunnet aff, Big Jack.

13:41.159 --> 13:43.240
ALL SNIGGER

13:43.240 --> 13:46.678
Big deal!
So I got my hair done this morning.

13:46.679 --> 13:50.679
How did you spend your afternoon -
getting stretched on a rack?

13:50.679 --> 13:52.719
Excuse me?
What height are you?

13:52.720 --> 13:54.920
Bloody stupid question.
Same height I've always been.

13:54.919 --> 13:57.360
You've always been 6'1"?
Aye!

13:57.360 --> 13:59.639
We've always been the same height,
you and me.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.360
I mean, that's why
we've always been pals -

14:02.360 --> 14:04.279
cos we ay see eye to eye.

14:04.279 --> 14:07.120
Nice troosers, Jack.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.200
Have you got lifts in your shoes,
Jack?

14:15.879 --> 14:17.840
Yes, Victor. I'm sorry.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.320
Listen, cards on the table -
I need a shot at this goodness

14:20.320 --> 14:22.920
and I sincerely hope it's no
gonnae affect our friendship.

14:22.919 --> 14:25.759
You know what I mean?
It will not.

14:25.759 --> 14:27.720
May the best man win.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.680
Aye, well, glad to hear that.

14:29.679 --> 14:32.879
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going for a pish.

14:51.879 --> 14:54.000
Wolf. Navid.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.679
The brass balls of you

14:56.679 --> 14:59.759
to walk in here so brazen when
you know that I am watching you.

14:59.759 --> 15:01.759
The Wolf needs to eat.

15:01.759 --> 15:03.559
And you don't think I'll catch you?

15:03.559 --> 15:05.399
SCOFFS
No with that big fat belly.

15:06.879 --> 15:10.279
SIGHS
Fair do's. I stand in defeat.

15:10.279 --> 15:12.119
Fill your boots.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.799
What new ploy's this?
I know when I am beaten.

15:22.879 --> 15:24.399
Chocolate bar.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.640
Packet of crisps.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.759
Tin of kidney beans for the dinner.
I love kidney beans.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.240
And to wash it all down...

15:46.440 --> 15:48.040
..a bottle of fizzo.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.080
CLICK

15:56.399 --> 15:59.639
Â£4.80, you little bastard.

16:03.639 --> 16:05.719
MEENA: Haw, Navid!

16:06.960 --> 16:09.000
Oh!

16:15.440 --> 16:19.880

16:22.200 --> 16:23.800
SIGHS

16:23.799 --> 16:28.240

16:29.519 --> 16:32.039
Hello, Bob.
MEOWS

16:32.039 --> 16:34.839
Hmm? What's this, you ask?

16:34.840 --> 16:41.280
It's...a deid roast chicken.
Still warm.

16:41.279 --> 16:43.799
Would you like a wee bit?
MEOWS

16:43.799 --> 16:45.120
Of course you would.

16:53.039 --> 16:55.000
Is that you hooked now?

16:55.000 --> 16:58.639
MEOWS
Well, the first bit was for free.

16:58.639 --> 17:00.759
But if you want
another piece of heaven,

17:00.759 --> 17:02.639
you're gonnae have to work for it.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.160
Walk this way.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.480
CAT MEOWS

17:17.640 --> 17:20.319
Hey, Joe. It's Winston.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.118
I hope you've got
a saw in the house,

17:22.118 --> 17:24.479
cos you are gonnae be
cutting me a catflap.

17:25.558 --> 17:29.199
Oh, you don't believe me?
Well, I'll take a wee photie.

17:31.279 --> 17:32.680
CAT MEOWS

17:33.680 --> 17:35.480
GROWLING

17:35.480 --> 17:37.240
SCREAMS

17:38.759 --> 17:40.039
Victor.

17:40.039 --> 17:41.279
Yes, Jack?

17:41.279 --> 17:43.039
Can you please turn the heating off?

17:43.039 --> 17:44.480
Take your cardigan off.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.880
No, it's no that.
It's just far too warm in here.

17:48.799 --> 17:50.559
LAUGHS
What you laughing at?

17:50.559 --> 17:52.599
Your hair is running down
your face, Jack.

17:52.599 --> 17:54.719
Shut it, beardy baws.

17:56.119 --> 17:58.879
Right, have you looked through
the questionnaire? I have, aye.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.360
Good.
OK, let's start at the top.

18:02.359 --> 18:05.519
What have you put for
outdoor activities?

18:05.519 --> 18:08.039
Well, I'm ticking yes,
cos there was a day last summer

18:08.039 --> 18:11.000
when it didnae rain and Boabby
did the barbecue in the car park.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.680
You and I had a rotten burger.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.440
So that's yes. Water sports.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.000
You mind we were pished,
we were chokin' for a slash...

18:18.000 --> 18:19.799
That's plenty, Jack.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.319
Oh, hold on, but...

18:21.319 --> 18:24.438
I was on the Waverley
for Billy Cassidy's stag,

18:24.439 --> 18:25.839
so I'm putting sailing.
Right.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.759
Well, I'm putting sailing, as well,

18:27.759 --> 18:31.160
because I remember being on a pedalo
wi' my Jean in Santa Ponsa.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.759
And the reason I remember
is because I burnt my foreheid,

18:33.759 --> 18:35.039
my shoulders and my belly.

18:35.039 --> 18:36.480
It was absolutely brutal.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.680
"Do you ride a horse?"
Yes.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.720
Since when?
Blackpool.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.240
That was a donkey, and you fell off
it because you were pished.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.880
Donkey, zebras - it's all one.

18:49.239 --> 18:51.919
Here, Jack, do you want to just
save time by ticking everything?

18:51.920 --> 18:53.080
Aye.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.639
You putting your photie in?

18:59.640 --> 19:02.400
Aye. Got it done at Jerome's.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.600
Well, it's Swifty Print noo.
Aye. Who done yours?

19:05.599 --> 19:07.240
Shug gave us a dig-oot.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.039
Well, give us a look at it, then.
You first.

19:10.039 --> 19:12.879
We'll baith go at the same time.
Come on.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.760
Promise not to laugh?

19:14.759 --> 19:16.000
No.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.159
VICTOR LAUGHS

19:23.799 --> 19:27.119
When did you get that took?
Yesterday.

19:27.119 --> 19:29.239
That's a boxing pose.
That's correct.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.480
But that's a wrestling belt.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.720
Is it?

19:33.839 --> 19:38.319
Oh, naw. See, I bought that for
the grand-wean's Christmas present,

19:38.319 --> 19:40.639
put it in the cupboard,
and forgot to send it.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.480
Think anybody'll notice?
Nah, it'll be fine. Put it in.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.720
Aye.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.839
Oh, right, show us yours.
Oh, aye.

19:51.039 --> 19:53.879
JACK LAUGHS

19:53.880 --> 19:55.640
That's brilliant. Oh, I like the way

19:55.640 --> 19:57.600
you're staring into
the middle distance.

19:57.599 --> 20:00.000
"Where will I go today
in my red E-Type Jaguar?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.480
"Will I go to the bookie's?
Will I go to the butcher's?

20:02.480 --> 20:03.799
"Will I go to the Clansman?"

20:03.799 --> 20:05.839
Whose car is that?
This big bastard's.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.240
Look at this!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.039
Put that in! Put it in!

20:20.759 --> 20:23.200
You've howled your last howl, Wolf.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.120
In a minute, it is me
who'll be howling...

20:26.160 --> 20:27.960
...with laughter, and that.

20:40.359 --> 20:41.719
Can I help you?

20:41.720 --> 20:43.600
I'm looking for a child
called Lone Wolf.

20:43.599 --> 20:45.240
Darren!

20:50.200 --> 20:52.759
MEOWS
No!

20:52.759 --> 20:55.000
I'm begging you, Bob, son,
don't go in.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.839
Come on, wee Toby.

20:58.839 --> 21:01.519
Come hame, son.

21:01.519 --> 21:04.759
Don't do it, Bob. He's a ratbag.

21:06.319 --> 21:12.000
No-o-o-o-o!

21:13.319 --> 21:15.839
I'm at my wits' end with this one.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.720
I don't know where he is
half the time

21:17.720 --> 21:19.559
and I don't know what he's up to.

21:19.559 --> 21:21.159
Where is the husband?

21:21.160 --> 21:23.880
He's away a lot of the time
on business.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.160
He's a diamond merchant, you see.
Really?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.920
Oh, aye. That's why
we're living like the Kardashians.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.920
No. He's pissed aff.
With the diamonds?

21:33.279 --> 21:37.359
Oh, I see. The diamonds are part of
the Kardashian sarcasm.

21:37.359 --> 21:40.759
You need to pay back every penny
you stole from Mr Harrid.

21:40.759 --> 21:43.119
How am I gonnae dae that?
I've nae money.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.640
What age are you, Darren?
13 last week.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.560
Well, it would appear
that 13 is your lucky number.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.039
PURRING

21:57.039 --> 21:59.359
How have you done that,

22:21.319 --> 22:22.720
You all right?

22:22.720 --> 22:25.279
I was, aye, but now
I feel a wee bit jumpy.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.799
Listen, all we want out of this is
for one of the two of us to win it.

22:30.799 --> 22:32.799
You've got every chance
in the world.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.120
Thanks, Jack. So do you.

22:37.119 --> 22:41.079
Just go in there
and be the best version of yourself.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.640
IMITATES SEAN CONNERY

22:47.640 --> 22:49.120

Thanks for coming in.

23:16.759 --> 23:18.000

23:25.038 --> 23:26.959
After that, you make good money.

23:26.960 --> 23:29.120
Thanks, Mr Harrid.

23:29.119 --> 23:31.879
I really do appreciate the
opportunity. I won't let you down.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.040
Good lad.

23:35.599 --> 23:37.359
Hi.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.158
So, it's Eesa?

23:42.160 --> 23:47.480
No, Isa, like Liza. Minnelli.
Drennan.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.480
I see you didn't put your age.
No.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.920
A lady never discusses her age.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.840
ELASTIC PINGS

24:01.359 --> 24:04.439
You see, Mr Mullen,
the couple we are looking for

24:04.440 --> 24:10.000
have to have that outdoor glow,
that sea-sprayed sparkle,

24:10.000 --> 24:14.400
a face that says, "I've had a life
and I'm still living it."

24:15.519 --> 24:17.720
Have you had any work done?

24:20.119 --> 24:23.599
I am aghast, shocked and horrified

24:23.599 --> 24:26.439
that you would even suggest
such a thing.

24:29.079 --> 24:31.839
Thanks very much, Mr Jarvis.

24:31.839 --> 24:33.559
It was a pleasure meeting you.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.960
Oh, is that it? Oh, well,
if you'd allow me for a second...

24:35.960 --> 24:37.840
The ladies love this, by the way.

24:47.400 --> 24:51.519
# Oh, I do like to be
beside the seaside

24:51.519 --> 24:54.160
âª Oh, I do like to be
beside the sea... âª

24:54.160 --> 24:56.960
That's fine. Thank you, Mr...
Shut up a minute.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.559
There's a better bit coming.

24:58.559 --> 25:01.960
âª ...I like to go swimmin'
and shag loads of women... âª

25:01.960 --> 25:05.680
OK, that's enough of that.
Thank you.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.759
Oh...oh, oh!

25:17.720 --> 25:20.519
Ha! No way, man!
The Wolf's got a job!

25:20.519 --> 25:23.839
All these papers are heavy
and my legs are killing me.

25:23.839 --> 25:25.319
See you later, mate.

25:29.599 --> 25:32.119
Good job, Winston.

25:32.119 --> 25:34.919
Aye, you're welcome, Joe.
A bet's a bet.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.640
Can I no put a catflap
in my door an' all

25:55.640 --> 25:57.800
and we can share the bloody cat?

25:57.799 --> 26:00.279
I'm no the sharing type, Winston.

26:00.279 --> 26:04.559
I won the bet, and what's mine's
mine. That's the way I like it.

26:04.559 --> 26:05.798
MEOW

26:05.799 --> 26:07.919
I thought you suited that beard.

26:07.920 --> 26:12.680

I just wanted it off, you know?

26:12.680 --> 26:14.720
I see you're back to 5'2".

26:14.720 --> 26:17.680

26:22.680 --> 26:25.640
And it'll no be long

26:29.920 --> 26:32.000
I had to pay full price!

26:32.000 --> 26:34.039
WHIMPERS

26:35.839 --> 26:40.519
Say hello to Mr...Twilight.

26:42.359 --> 26:45.119
Aw, Shug!

26:46.799 --> 26:49.159
Well done, Shug.
Well deserved, Shug.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.798
What can I tell you, eh?

26:50.799 --> 26:54.079
My years in the Navy.
My specialised skill-set.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.039
I am an outdoor man.

26:56.039 --> 26:58.480
What about the wig?
Oh, they never even noticed it.

26:58.480 --> 27:01.680
To Mr Twilight - Shug!

27:02.680 --> 27:04.320
And Mrs Twilight -

27:04.319 --> 27:05.480

27:12.400 --> 27:14.240
Wow, Edith.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.440
You look hu...human.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.480
What did you do wi'
your hairy moles?

27:21.480 --> 27:25.400
They took them aff.
There's a wee keepsake.

27:29.559 --> 27:30.759
And your hump?

27:30.759 --> 27:33.519
Turns out it wisnae
curvature of the spine.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.920
It was just fluid.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.039
JACK GAGS

27:40.480 --> 27:45.880
What can I get the glamorous girl?
A pina colada? A Cuba libre?

27:45.880 --> 27:47.600
Pint of Guinness.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.759
Look who it is, Joe.
A wolf in sheepish clothing.

28:20.759 --> 28:22.960
I'm sorry, Joe.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.639
My feet were sore
and I just wanted a shot.

28:25.638 --> 28:29.438
Nae harm done, son.
We'll say no more about it.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.919
You're lucky, son. Another chance.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.759
You are at a fork in the road.

28:34.759 --> 28:38.240
Down one path,
a life of petty crime and infamy.

28:38.240 --> 28:43.759
The other road?
Hard work, reward, respect.

28:50.079 --> 28:53.759
HOWLS LIKE A WOLF

28:54.305 --> 29:00.655
