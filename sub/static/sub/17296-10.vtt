Ah! Water.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.548
Nectar of the gods.

00:26.591 --> 00:30.073
That's right. Drink that water
and gets yourself hydrated.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.294
There is nothing,

00:33.337 --> 00:36.862
nothing like a cool glass
of water on a long day.

00:38.951 --> 00:42.346
I like to get as much water in my mouth
as possible and just hold it there

00:42.390 --> 00:44.653
to really enjoy
the delicate flavor

00:54.184 --> 00:56.273
Friends! I have just seen...

00:56.317 --> 00:57.883
Dun-dun-dun.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.059
The Penguin.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.627
The Penguin!

01:02.671 --> 01:04.542
Yes! And also...

01:04.586 --> 01:08.024
The Killer Crocodile.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.114
Killer Croc, too!

01:11.158 --> 01:13.290
Yes! And...

01:15.162 --> 01:16.424
The Woman Cat.

01:18.339 --> 01:19.862
Catwoman!

01:19.905 --> 01:21.690
Where did you see
these animals, Star?

01:21.733 --> 01:23.300
I will show you.

01:23.344 --> 01:26.042
Follow me!

01:30.568 --> 01:34.050
- No sign of The Penguin or Killer Croc.
- There they are.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.622
And there is the Woman Cat.

01:43.146 --> 01:46.236
Oh, you were talking
about actual animals.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.803
Was I misunderstood?

01:47.846 --> 01:50.153
Yeah, you was.
You made us spit out that good water.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.851
All that cool, clear water...

01:52.895 --> 01:54.026
Gone forever.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.159
That sweet, sweet
nectar of the gods.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.465
Lost!

01:57.508 --> 02:00.032
All of that water,
spit out to the ground.

02:06.735 --> 02:07.953
Star?

02:07.997 --> 02:10.260
I would like to
give the apologies

02:10.304 --> 02:15.309
for ruining the precious water with
my linguistic misunderstandings.

02:15.352 --> 02:17.354
Misunderstandings
are normal, Star.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.486
- Don't sweat it.
- Yeah.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.444
And we likes how
you talks all bads.

02:20.488 --> 02:24.666
I only wish I had the gift of the
clear speech that you all possess.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.103
Star, if you change
the way you talk,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.626
it would change who you are.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.063
Besides, it's not something
you can just do overnight.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.282
Oh, but I could.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.197
The Tamaranian people
can learn language

02:34.241 --> 02:36.634
and speech patterns
through the lip contact

02:38.375 --> 02:40.377
Are you...

02:40.421 --> 02:42.336
Are you talking about kissing?

02:46.035 --> 02:49.995
If Starfire wants to communicate more
clearly, then we have to help her!

02:50.039 --> 02:51.693
Oh, wonderful!

02:51.736 --> 02:54.609
But you all have such appealing
particulars to your speech.

02:54.652 --> 02:57.655
How shall I decide with whom
to make the lip contact?

02:57.699 --> 02:59.831
You could play Spin the Bottle.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.356
Great idea!
That is a great idea.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.922
We just need a bottle,
any bottle.

03:03.966 --> 03:06.925
Get out of my way!
I need a bottle!
Bottle, bottle, bottle!

03:08.362 --> 03:09.754
Here we go!

03:09.798 --> 03:13.323
- Calm down, dude.
- You calm down, dude!

03:13.367 --> 03:14.846
I'll go first.

03:19.982 --> 03:24.247
- Ooh!
- You've got to kiss the cactus.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.031
Hey, handsome.

03:26.075 --> 03:28.295
Give me a kiss.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.385
Ouch!

03:31.428 --> 03:32.908
He gots a crush on it, y'all.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.953
I do not!
Like I would ever...

03:34.997 --> 03:37.739
I'm way too attractive
to date this cactus.

03:37.782 --> 03:38.827
Ouch!

03:39.741 --> 03:42.396
Star, you should spin.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.833
Please land on me.
Please land on me.
Please land on me.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.531
Yeah, boy!

03:47.575 --> 03:49.794
Here is going the nothing.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.756
Dids it work?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.453
I don't know. Dids it?

03:56.497 --> 03:57.411
Woah.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.500
I sounds like you, yo.

03:59.543 --> 04:02.067
You do sounds like me, yo.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.679
- That's what's up.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.464
Nows you all knows whats
exactly what I'm sayin'.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.423
This was a...

04:09.466 --> 04:11.207
Great idea.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.383
I'm very happy with how it's turned out.
Excuse me.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.298
I need a moment.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.217
Yo, let's hits up the pool!

04:23.263 --> 04:25.308
Whaddup, my mans and womans!

04:25.352 --> 04:26.788
Oh. Hey Star.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.530
Yo, mama. Your aura is
lookin' tight today.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.488
What are you saying?

04:32.446 --> 04:33.838
Your aura, mama.

04:33.882 --> 04:36.363
You knows,
your metaphysical flows.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.626
My metaphysical what, now?

04:38.669 --> 04:40.976
Your life force
emanation, my man.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.413
- What?
- Your ethereal vibe.

04:43.457 --> 04:46.111
Like the life forces in vital
principles of the universe

04:46.155 --> 04:49.767
that are all flowing around in
your bodies as organic energies.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.857
- Say what?
- Your aura, bro.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.163
You know.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.991
The cycle of life
in its endless rotations,

04:56.034 --> 04:58.907
making contact with
your nerve plexius', homie.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.911
What are you saying?

05:02.954 --> 05:05.305
Ah... Forget the it, mama.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.310
Even with friend
Beast Boy's vocabulary,

05:10.353 --> 05:13.138
I was unable to communicate
in the clear way.

05:13.182 --> 05:16.794
Am I doomed to be forever
Mr. or Miss understood?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.927
Star, the way
you speak is unique.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.407
You shouldn't
ever feel ashamed...

05:20.450 --> 05:22.191
Woah, whoa, whoa.
What Raven's trying to say

05:22.234 --> 05:24.541
is that you just haven't found
the right pair of lips yet.

05:24.585 --> 05:27.327
That's why we're playing
Spin the Bottle again.

05:27.370 --> 05:31.548
And this time, I have calculated the
exact amount of spin I must apply,

05:31.592 --> 05:33.811
so the bottle will
land on Starfire.

05:42.559 --> 05:43.691
But my math was perfect!

05:43.734 --> 05:45.606
Oh, a second date.

05:45.649 --> 05:48.957
You must be in love with me.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.438
I am not. I simply respect
the rules of Spin the Bottle.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.743
Ouch!

05:52.787 --> 05:56.007
Argh! Ouch! Ah!
Stop, my eye! Ah!

05:57.052 --> 05:59.489
Go ahead, Star.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.796
Please land on me.
Please land on me.
Please land on me.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.538
All right!

06:04.581 --> 06:07.105
So unfair...

06:12.023 --> 06:15.549
Oh! That's what I'm talking about! Whoo!

06:15.592 --> 06:18.160
Yo, you want to watch
these sweet VHS tapes?

06:18.203 --> 06:20.641
Only if it's that
classic TV lineup.

06:20.684 --> 06:21.816
You know it, my dude!

06:21.859 --> 06:24.209
- Boo-yah, baby. Whoo!
- Boo-yah!

06:30.259 --> 06:33.915
Oh, yes.

06:35.307 --> 06:38.267
Ugh. Are we really
watching old TV shows?

06:38.310 --> 06:39.486
You know it, my dude!

06:40.661 --> 06:41.966
Did I do that?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.926
Did Urkel seriously
just ask if he did that?

06:44.969 --> 06:46.710
Oh, this guy is unbelievable.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.583
He's got the nerve to straight
do something and then say,

06:49.626 --> 06:50.801
"Did I do that?"

06:50.845 --> 06:52.150
Come on!

06:52.194 --> 06:53.717
Yes, you did that!

06:53.761 --> 06:55.763
You were walkin' around all
clumsy and knockin' stuff over.

06:55.806 --> 06:58.156
We all saw you do it, Steve!

06:58.200 --> 07:00.942
Just snappin' his suspenders
like he didn't do nothin'.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.510
You did it, Steve.
You know you did it, dude!

07:05.250 --> 07:06.208
Yo, but for real.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.428
Jaleel White is a comic genius.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.691
And while we're on some
real classic TV talk,

07:10.734 --> 07:12.606
and y'all might think
I'm crazy on this one,

07:12.649 --> 07:16.697
but, I'll always prefer Bronson
Pinchot's loveable Balki, over Urkel.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.046
Uh... Balki?

07:18.089 --> 07:19.569
What are you talking about?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.789
I'm just sayin',
Balki over Urkel.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.966
You might be thinkin', "Who, in their right
mind, is gonna take Balki over Urkel?"

07:25.009 --> 07:26.837
Even cousin Larry
is gonna go with Urkel.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.535
Jennifer and Mary Anne
are gonna go with Urkel.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.189
But Balki, man. I'm telling
you, he's got the...

07:32.495 --> 07:34.584
What?

07:34.628 --> 07:35.890
Never the mind.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.631
Don't sweat it, Star.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.981
You just got too deep in the
Classic TV lineup. That's all.

07:40.024 --> 07:43.593
Regardless, I still yearn to
communicate more clearly.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.726
Then another game of Spin
the Bottle is in order.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.771
Woah, what's up
with your face, Robin?

07:47.815 --> 07:50.078
I, uh, fell onto the cactus.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.775
Fortunately,
my lips broke my fall.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.780
Star, kissing all these
people isn't working.

07:56.824 --> 07:59.000
It's better to be yourself
and be misunderstood,

07:59.043 --> 08:00.610
than change yourself
just to fit in.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.874
That is the crazy talk,
friend Raven.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.659
I must keep doing the kisses

08:05.702 --> 08:09.314
until I find the one who will
grant me the clearness of speech.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.932
That was off the chain!

08:17.975 --> 08:20.369
Oh, dang.
That's ridonkulous.

08:24.765 --> 08:25.766
Howdy!

08:40.650 --> 08:42.522
Pain. Pain.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.045
Pain.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.830
Howdy!

08:46.874 --> 08:48.702
Ridonkulous.

08:48.745 --> 08:49.746
Pain.

08:49.790 --> 08:50.791
Oh, dang.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.537
What's happening to her?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.844
This isn't good. With every new voice
and personality that Starfire takes on,

09:00.888 --> 09:03.194
a little bit of her own
personality disappears.

09:03.238 --> 09:06.981
If this goes on much longer, we'll lose
the Starfire we know and love forever!

09:07.938 --> 09:09.636
We can't let that happen.

09:09.679 --> 09:10.811
Titans, go!

09:49.023 --> 09:50.372
Star...

09:50.415 --> 09:52.461
Robin, you can't
let her kiss you.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.637
You'll erase her
personality forever!

09:54.681 --> 09:57.335
Don't... Let her...
Kiss me.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.691
I can't let you kiss me, Star.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.780
And, not just because the cactus
and I have gotten pretty serious.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.746
Ah! Yep.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.748
Gonna drive out to the desert
this weekend and meet her folks.

10:18.792 --> 10:22.839
I can't kiss you because we
all like you the way you are.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.625
It's okay if we don't understand
each other sometimes.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.670
It's a normal part
of any relationship.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.542
Please, please
don't change who you are.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.937
We love you.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.069
Howdy!

10:35.112 --> 10:36.679
Howdy!

10:36.723 --> 10:37.854
Howdy.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.334
Howdy.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.815
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

10:41.858 --> 10:46.689
It is all the Bill of Rights to
be one's, two's and three's self.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.734
Glad you're back, Star.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.561
Oh, no!

10:49.605 --> 10:53.435
Friends, it is The Penguin,
Killer Croc and the Woman Cat!

10:53.478 --> 10:55.219
Yeah, we're not going
to the zoo this time.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.311
That's ridonkulous.
