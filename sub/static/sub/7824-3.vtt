00:02.870 --> 00:04.370
( clears throat )
Hello everyone.

00:04.430 --> 00:07.900
You know, Halloween
is a very strange holiday.

00:07.970 --> 00:09.740
Personally,
I don't understand it.

00:09.810 --> 00:13.610
Kids worshipping ghosts,
pretending to be devils..

00:13.680 --> 00:17.220
Things on TV that
are completely inappropriate

00:17.280 --> 00:18.750
for younger viewers.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.980
Things like
the following half-hour.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.090
Nothing seems to bother my kids

00:23.150 --> 00:24.390
but tonight's show--

00:24.450 --> 00:26.880
which I totally
wash my hands of--

00:26.960 --> 00:28.260
is really scary.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.620
So, if you have
sensitive children

00:30.690 --> 00:32.890
maybe you should tuck them
into bed early tonight

00:32.960 --> 00:35.900
instead of writing us
angry letters tomorrow.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.040
Thanks for your attention.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.970
Captioning made possible by
20th Century Fox Television

00:51.950 --> 00:53.350
( screams and howls )

01:07.400 --> 01:09.670
Ooh, what a haul this year.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.170
I love Halloween.

01:11.230 --> 01:12.490
Heh, heh.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.140
Wait a minute.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.130
Let's see what
the kids are up to.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.740
...and the policeman on the
other end of the phone said

01:19.810 --> 01:21.810
"We have traced the call.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.420
"It's coming from the floor
below you.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.780
"Get out of the house!"

01:25.850 --> 01:27.750
But it was too late.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.150
End of story.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.360
Yawn..I heard that
when I was in third grade.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.460
It's not scary.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.120
Is too!

01:33.190 --> 01:33.730
Is not.

01:33.790 --> 01:34.660
Is too!

01:34.720 --> 01:35.520
- Is not!
- Is too.

01:35.590 --> 01:36.530
Fine.

01:36.590 --> 01:37.860
Then you tell one scarier.

01:37.930 --> 01:39.460
Flashlight, please.

01:41.260 --> 01:44.890
Here's a story
that's <i>really scarifying.</i>

01:44.970 --> 01:46.200
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

01:46.270 --> 01:47.440
I call it...

01:49.810 --> 01:53.110
( <i>Bart laughing maniacally )</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:56.870
That's all of it.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.050
Sign here.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.010
There you are, my man

02:00.080 --> 02:02.020
and a dollar
for yourself.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.280
A buck.

02:03.350 --> 02:06.160
I'm glad there's a curse
on this place.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.289
Well, it's all ours.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.260
I still can't believe
how inexpensive it was.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.700
Motivated seller, Marge.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.070
He certainly
must have been motivated.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.830
Prime location,
18 bedrooms, a moat.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.400
<i>We shouldn't be able
to afford this.</i>

02:19.470 --> 02:22.140
So we got a good deal
for once.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.530
Quit fighting it.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.040
It just seems too good
to be true.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.040
Ow! Mom, Bart threw
a book at me!

02:29.110 --> 02:29.750
Did not.

02:29.810 --> 02:30.320
Did too!

02:30.380 --> 02:30.920
Did not!

02:30.980 --> 02:31.780
Did too!

02:31.850 --> 02:33.850
Male voice:
<i>Get out!</i>

02:33.920 --> 02:36.590
Marge:
What on Earth was that?

02:36.650 --> 02:37.860
Probably just
the house settling.

02:37.920 --> 02:38.790
<i>( Marge groans )</i>

02:42.160 --> 02:46.630
Hmm, this kitchen certainly
could use a woman's touch.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.770
Homer!

02:50.830 --> 02:52.960
What's this thing
in the corner?
I dunno.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.940
It looks like a vortex--

02:55.000 --> 02:57.300
a gateway
into another dimension.

02:57.370 --> 02:59.500
Ooh, a vortex.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.710
Catch!

03:04.650 --> 03:06.950
Hey, pretty slick.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.290
Huh?

03:10.950 --> 03:14.480
"Quit throwing your garbage
into our dimension."

03:14.560 --> 03:15.660
Mom, Dad

03:15.720 --> 03:17.920
<i>Help!</i>

03:17.990 --> 03:19.520
( <i>gagging )</i>

03:19.600 --> 03:22.170
voice:
<i>Get out.</i>

03:22.230 --> 03:26.340
Okay, boy, let's see you
talk yourself out of this one.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.570
I can feel an evil presence
in this house.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.410
Evil?

03:30.470 --> 03:31.300
Quiet, Lisa.

03:31.370 --> 03:32.530
You're scaring
your mother.

03:32.610 --> 03:34.080
Children,
get your coats.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.840
We're leaving
this house right now.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.150
Wait a minute, Marge.

03:37.210 --> 03:40.280
It's only natural there
would be some things wrong

03:40.350 --> 03:42.520
with an old house
like this.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.380
It's a fixer-upper.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.810
What's the problem?
We get a bunch of priests
in here...

03:46.890 --> 03:50.700
I'm not going to live
in a house of evil just
to save a few dollars.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.100
Don't be so stubborn!

03:53.160 --> 03:55.870
We're not talking about
a <i>few dollars.</i>

03:55.930 --> 03:58.770
We're talking about
a few <i>thousand dollars!</i>

03:58.830 --> 04:00.160
( <i>screaming )</i>

04:00.240 --> 04:01.740
It's got great

04:01.800 --> 04:03.200
high ceilings.

04:03.270 --> 04:05.010
( <i>screaming )</i>

04:06.240 --> 04:10.550
Tell you what,
let's sleep on it, okay?

04:10.610 --> 04:13.070
All right,
but if anything happens...

04:13.150 --> 04:14.450
What could happen?

04:14.520 --> 04:15.320
Mmm...

04:19.490 --> 04:23.430
male voice:
<i>They are all against you, Bart.</i>

04:23.490 --> 04:26.130
<i>You must kill them all.</i>

04:26.200 --> 04:28.670
<i>They all must die.</i>

04:28.730 --> 04:30.740
Are you my conscience?

04:30.800 --> 04:32.340
<i>I....</i>

04:32.400 --> 04:34.970
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

04:35.040 --> 04:38.840
<i>Lisa, Lisa.</i>

04:38.910 --> 04:42.280
<i>The butcher knife, Lisa.</i>

04:47.480 --> 04:50.080
They are all against me.

04:50.150 --> 04:54.030
They all must die.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.420
Marge.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.070
Oh, Marge?

05:05.130 --> 05:08.100
Marge:
I'm in the kitchen, Homer.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.480
<i>Die!</i>

05:18.550 --> 05:20.150
<i>Die!</i>

05:20.220 --> 05:21.620
<i>Everybody, die.</i>

05:21.680 --> 05:24.150
( <i>maniacal laughter )</i>

05:27.390 --> 05:28.960
( <i>gasping )</i>

05:29.020 --> 05:30.950
What's going on
out here?

05:31.030 --> 05:33.930
Homer, Bart, Lisa, Maggie,
stop it!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.330
Sorry, Mom.
Sorry, Bart.
Sorry, Dad.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.600
That does it.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.940
Children, get dressed.
We're leaving.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.970
C'mon Marge, you said
you'd sleep on it.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
I don't care what I said.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.380
This family has had its
differences, and we've squabbled

05:44.440 --> 05:46.980
but we never had
knife fights before

05:47.040 --> 05:48.980
and I blame this house.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.540
Mom, Dad, look!

05:51.610 --> 05:54.780
It's an ancient
Indian burial ground.

05:54.850 --> 05:58.320
Bart:
Man, this place
has got everything.

05:58.390 --> 05:59.890
Homer:
An ancient Indian what?!

06:03.260 --> 06:06.100
Mr. Plute, Homer Simpson here.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.600
When you sold me this house

06:08.660 --> 06:11.190
you forgot to mention
one little thing.

06:11.270 --> 06:16.140
You didn't tell me it was built
on an Indian burial ground!

06:16.200 --> 06:18.600
No, you didn't!

06:19.780 --> 06:21.410
Well, that's not
my recollection.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.680
Yeah, well...
all right, good-bye.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.490
He says he mentioned it
five or six times.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.790
Let's go, children.

06:29.850 --> 06:30.790
Aw, gee, Marge.

06:30.850 --> 06:31.610
Homer.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.160
<i>voice: You will die.</i>

06:33.220 --> 06:35.830
<i>You will die slowly.</i>

06:35.890 --> 06:38.160
<i>Your stomach will swell.</i>

06:38.230 --> 06:41.570
<i>Your intestines
will rise and boil.</i>

06:41.630 --> 06:43.840
<i>Your eyes will burst</i>

06:43.900 --> 06:46.170
<i>and some horrible stuff--</i>

06:46.230 --> 06:48.130
<i>possibly your brains--</i>

06:48.200 --> 06:51.300
<i>will start coming out
through your nose.</i>

06:51.370 --> 06:52.630
Shush!

06:52.710 --> 06:53.680
Shut up!

06:53.740 --> 06:55.980
Quit trying to push us around!

06:56.040 --> 06:58.410
Stop saying
those horrible things

06:58.480 --> 07:00.550
and show some manners!

07:05.550 --> 07:07.920
Look at me.
I've never been so angry.

07:07.990 --> 07:09.660
My hands are shaking.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.700
Better than
your eyes bursting.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.460
- Do it again.
- <i>What?</i>

07:13.530 --> 07:14.370
Make the walls bleed.

07:14.430 --> 07:15.430
<i>No.</i>

07:15.500 --> 07:16.430
Hey, man, we own you.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.140
Let's see some blood.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.470
<i>I don't have to entertain you.</i>

07:20.540 --> 07:21.470
Come on, man, do it.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.340
Do the blood thing.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.000
C'mon! Do it! Do it! Do it!

07:24.070 --> 07:26.800
Why are you trying to scare us?

07:26.880 --> 07:30.250
Are you trying to keep us
from getting close to you?
Maybe even loving you?

07:30.310 --> 07:31.720
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

07:31.780 --> 07:33.720
Don't talk to her
like that.

07:33.780 --> 07:34.650
<i>Hey listen, lady...</i>

07:34.720 --> 07:36.150
Don't call me lady.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.220
My name is Marge Simpson.

07:38.290 --> 07:41.230
This is my family
and we're not going anywhere.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.930
We're all going
to have to live together

07:42.990 --> 07:46.500
so you better get used to it.
Please.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.330
<i>Can I have a minute
to think about this?</i>

07:49.400 --> 07:50.300
Sure.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.360
<i>Hmm...</i>

07:56.440 --> 07:58.380
<i>Life with the Simpsons.</i>

07:58.440 --> 08:00.780
<i>What choice do I have?</i>

08:06.420 --> 08:07.850
Homer:
Wow.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.450
Bart:
Bitchin'!

08:09.520 --> 08:11.120
It chose to destroy itself

08:11.190 --> 08:12.820
rather than live with us.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.930
You can't help
but feel a little rejected.

08:19.130 --> 08:20.500
That wasn't scary at all, Bart.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.890
Oh yeah? Well how about...
this severed finger?!

08:27.770 --> 08:30.810
Eww, baby spit.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.970
Well that last story
was just a warm-up

08:33.039 --> 08:34.980
for this macabre tale

08:35.039 --> 08:36.470
which I call...

08:42.580 --> 08:44.850
Homer, all these flies.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.990
Not to worry.

08:46.050 --> 08:48.850
I'll just turn on
the trusty bug zapper.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.500
Ooh, that was a big mama.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.990
( <i>humming )</i>

09:09.510 --> 09:10.580
That should just about do it.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.920
Man alive,
there's nothing better

09:12.980 --> 09:15.690
than a hamburger grilled
to perfection...

09:17.750 --> 09:19.110
Cool, man!

09:21.590 --> 09:22.630
( <i>gasping )</i>

09:32.570 --> 09:35.040
Your burgers
are getting cold...

09:35.100 --> 09:36.700
Holy moly.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.400
( <i>screaming )</i>

09:43.810 --> 09:45.350
( <i>screaming )</i>

09:45.410 --> 09:46.470
( <i>screaming )</i>

09:46.550 --> 09:47.920
Huh?

10:10.540 --> 10:12.040
( <i>quivering )</i>

10:12.110 --> 10:12.780
Greetings, Earthlings.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.180
I am Kang.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.970
Do not be frightened.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.920
<i>We mean you
no harm.</i>

10:18.980 --> 10:21.120
You speak
English.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.980
I am actually
speaking Rigellian.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.320
By an astonishing
coincidence

10:24.390 --> 10:26.990
both of our languages
are exactly the same.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.990
Well what are you gonna
do with us, man?

10:29.060 --> 10:32.160
Kodos and I are taking you
to Rigel Four--

10:32.230 --> 10:35.370
a world of infinite delights
to tantalize your senses

10:35.430 --> 10:38.540
<i>and challenge
your intellectual limitations.</i>

10:38.600 --> 10:40.570
Look, I know that to you

10:40.640 --> 10:43.570
we Simpsons
are a lower order of life.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.510
We face that prejudice
every day of our lives,

10:45.570 --> 10:47.670
but we are happy
on our little planet.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.370
We throw ourselves
on your mercy.
Please return us to...

10:50.450 --> 10:51.580
<i>Dinnertime.</i>

10:51.650 --> 10:54.120
Hey, get a load
of that spread.

10:54.180 --> 10:57.040
Here you go, Earthlings.
Take all you want,
but eat all you take.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.720
Marge:
Thank you very much, mister..?

10:59.790 --> 11:01.730
To pronounce it correctly

11:01.790 --> 11:04.700
I would have to pull out
your tongue.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.900
Eww.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.790
Fried shrimp.

11:08.860 --> 11:09.990
Sloppy Joes.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.670
Smothered pork chops.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.490
Look Homer, radish rosettes.

11:13.570 --> 11:15.340
These are hard to make.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.330
They're a very advanced race.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.340
Come, Earthlings, eat.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.280
Grow large with food.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.150
There's something
not quite right about this.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.590
The girl's right.

11:28.650 --> 11:32.420
Let's get some apple sauce
out here for these pork chops.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.630
What are you
looking at, buddy?

11:34.690 --> 11:37.560
Your wife is
quite a dish.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.000
Ooh, thanks.

11:40.060 --> 11:43.000
It is our great pleasure
to provide you

11:43.060 --> 11:46.760
with unlimited entertainment
on your intergalactic journey.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.110
On this cable system
we receive over one million

11:49.170 --> 11:51.510
channels from the furthest
reaches of the galaxy.

11:51.570 --> 11:52.700
You get H.B.O.?

11:52.770 --> 11:54.500
No. That would cost extra.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.480
Here is
our crowning achievement

11:56.540 --> 11:59.140
in amusement technology--
an electronic version

11:59.210 --> 12:01.540
of what you call
table tennis.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.590
Your paddles
have been replaced
by an electronic...

12:03.650 --> 12:04.620
That's just Pong.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.290
Get with the times, man.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.620
Marge and I played that old
game before we were married.

12:09.690 --> 12:11.200
We did build this
spaceship, you know.

12:11.260 --> 12:12.660
Anyone from a species

12:12.730 --> 12:14.400
that has mastered
intergalactic travel

12:14.460 --> 12:15.690
raise your hand.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.770
All right, then.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.780
Sorry.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.710
Your game is very nice.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.610
Dinnertime.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.080
Hey, how come we
never see you guys eat?

12:33.150 --> 12:37.150
Oh, we wouldn't
want to spoil our appetite

12:37.220 --> 12:41.360
for the great feast
when we land on Rigel Four.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.850
Ooh, a feast!

12:42.920 --> 12:44.420
Will we be invited?

12:44.490 --> 12:47.190
Oh, you'll <i>be at the feast.</i>

12:47.260 --> 12:50.730
I have a feeling
you'll be the guests of honor.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.200
( <i>ominous laughter )</i>

12:53.270 --> 12:54.970
Tell us more about this feast.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.210
No, no, eat now.

12:57.270 --> 12:58.510
When we arrive

12:58.570 --> 13:00.170
there will be
plenty of time

13:00.240 --> 13:02.280
to chew the fat.

13:02.340 --> 13:04.970
( <i>laughter )</i>

13:09.050 --> 13:10.920
Very good, Earth boy.

13:12.950 --> 13:16.050
( <i>oohing and ahhing )</i>

13:16.120 --> 13:18.050
Excellent, Mr. Simpson.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.660
Excellent.

13:28.070 --> 13:28.910
( <i>gasps )</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:33.680
This will give the humans
the perfect flavor.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.250
( <i>gasps )</i>

13:47.590 --> 13:49.130
Stop! Don't you see

13:49.190 --> 13:50.560
what's happening here?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.500
They're fattening us up
so they can eat us!

13:53.560 --> 13:55.470
Oh, come on, Lisa.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.870
If you don't believe me,
then just look at this book
that I found.

13:57.930 --> 13:58.960
( all gasp )

14:00.440 --> 14:02.210
Look! She's right!

14:02.270 --> 14:04.140
Humans, you have stopped eating.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.710
Listen, you big, stupid
space creature.

14:06.780 --> 14:10.050
Nobody, but <i>nobody
eats the Simpsons.</i>

14:10.110 --> 14:11.020
I beg your pardon?

14:11.080 --> 14:12.020
Don't play dumb with me.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.150
We found your book.

14:13.210 --> 14:14.640
You mean this?

14:14.720 --> 14:16.820
It's a harmless cookbook.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.820
It's just a little dusty.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.380
( <i>sighs of relief )</i>

14:25.230 --> 14:27.100
Wait a minute.

14:29.630 --> 14:30.630
Aha!

14:30.700 --> 14:31.700
( <i>gasping )</i>

14:31.770 --> 14:32.840
Wait.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.340
There's still more space dust
on here.

14:36.570 --> 14:37.780
( <i>sighs of relief )</i>

14:37.840 --> 14:39.440
Let me get this straight.

14:39.510 --> 14:40.840
You thought...

14:40.910 --> 14:43.850
They thought we were
going to eat them.

14:43.910 --> 14:45.450
Good God, is this
some kind of joke?

14:45.510 --> 14:48.440
No. They're serious.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.120
Well why were you trying
to make us eat all the time?

14:51.190 --> 14:52.290
<i>Make you eat?</i>

14:52.350 --> 14:54.750
We merely provided
a sumptuous banquet

14:54.820 --> 14:57.990
and, frankly, you people
made pigs of yourselves.

14:58.060 --> 15:01.030
I slaved in the kitchen
for days

15:01.100 --> 15:02.600
for you people and...

15:02.660 --> 15:05.960
Well, if you wanted to make
Shiroc the Preparer cry

15:06.030 --> 15:07.830
mission accomplished.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.200
Shiroc:
You aren't the only beings
who have emotions, you know.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.010
We offered you paradise.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.010
You would have
experienced emotions

15:23.080 --> 15:25.750
100 times greater
than what you call love

15:25.820 --> 15:28.760
and 1000 times greater
than what you call fun.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.920
You would have been treated
like gods

15:30.990 --> 15:33.920
and lived forever
in beauty

15:34.000 --> 15:37.470
but, now, because of
your distrustful nature

15:37.530 --> 15:38.700
that can never be.

15:38.770 --> 15:41.670
For a superior race,
they really rub it in.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.550
There were monsters
on that ship

15:48.610 --> 15:50.980
and truly we were them.

15:51.050 --> 15:54.220
Marge:
Lisa, see what we mean when
we say 'you're too smart for
your own good?'

15:54.280 --> 15:55.490
Bart:
Way to go, Lise.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.350
Homer:
Yeah, thanks, Lisa.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.580
( <i>gagging )</i>

16:00.660 --> 16:01.390
Hello.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.060
Something scary happening.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.690
( <i>gagging )</i>

16:06.900 --> 16:08.900
Hey, poindexter,
it's Halloween.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.620
Put the book away.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.000
For your information

16:12.070 --> 16:15.240
I'm about to read you
a classic tale of terror

16:15.300 --> 16:17.360
by Edgar Allan Poe.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.410
Wait a minute.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.800
That's a school book.

16:19.870 --> 16:22.140
Don't worry, Bart,
you won't learn anything.

16:22.210 --> 16:25.380
It's called "The Raven".

16:25.450 --> 16:28.590
"Once upon a midnight dreary

16:28.650 --> 16:31.390
narrator:
<i>"While I pondered,
weak and weary</i>

16:31.450 --> 16:34.180
<i>"over many
a quaint and curious volume</i>

16:34.260 --> 16:35.290
<i>"of forgotten lore--</i>

16:35.360 --> 16:37.490
<i>"while I nodded,
nearly napping</i>

16:37.560 --> 16:39.560
<i>"suddenly there came a tapping</i>

16:39.630 --> 16:41.330
<i>as of some one gently rapping</i>

16:41.400 --> 16:42.930
<i>rapping at my chamber door.</i>

16:43.000 --> 16:44.600
'Tis some visitor..."

16:44.670 --> 16:46.040
<i>I muttered,</i>

16:46.100 --> 16:48.710
"...tapping at my chamber door;

16:48.770 --> 16:51.110
Only this, and nothing more."

16:51.170 --> 16:52.800
Bart:
<i>Are we scared yet?</i>

16:52.870 --> 16:54.400
Lisa:
<i>Bart, he's establishing mood.</i>

16:54.480 --> 16:55.550
( snoring )

16:55.610 --> 16:57.410
Narrator:
<i>"Ah, distinctly I remember</i>

16:57.480 --> 16:59.420
<i>"it was in the bleak December</i>

16:59.480 --> 17:01.420
<i>"and each separate dying ember</i>

17:01.480 --> 17:03.310
<i>"wrought its ghost
upon the floor.</i>

17:03.380 --> 17:05.310
<i>"Eagerly I wished the morrow;</i>

17:05.390 --> 17:07.490
<i>"vainly I had sought to borrow</i>

17:07.560 --> 17:09.630
<i>from my books
surcease of sorrow--"</i>

17:09.690 --> 17:11.460
Huh?

17:11.530 --> 17:14.300
<i>Sorrow for the lost Lenore--"</i>

17:14.359 --> 17:15.770
Oh, Lenore.

17:15.829 --> 17:17.800
<i>"For the rare
and radiant maiden</i>

17:17.869 --> 17:20.200
<i>"whom the angels named Lenore--</i>

17:20.270 --> 17:22.069
<i>nameless here forevermore."</i>

17:22.839 --> 17:24.740
Ah!

17:24.810 --> 17:25.880
<i>"And the silken, sad</i>

17:25.940 --> 17:27.109
<i>"uncertain rustling</i>

17:27.180 --> 17:28.850
<i>"of each purple curtain
thrilled me--</i>

17:28.910 --> 17:31.350
<i>"Filled me
with fantastic terrors</i>

17:31.410 --> 17:32.770
<i>"never felt before;</i>

17:32.850 --> 17:35.250
<i>"so that now, to still
the beating of my heart</i>

17:35.320 --> 17:36.620
<i>"I stood repeating</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:38.580
'tis a visitor entreating
entrance at my chamber door;

17:38.650 --> 17:40.150
This is it,
and nothing more.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.060
<i>"Presently my soul
grew stronger;</i>

17:42.120 --> 17:43.980
<i>"hesitating then no longer</i>

17:44.060 --> 17:45.030
Sir..

<i>"Said I</i>

17:46.060 --> 17:47.430
or madam

17:47.500 --> 17:49.430
truly your forgiveness
I implore;

17:49.500 --> 17:51.470
but the fact is,
I was napping

17:51.530 --> 17:54.930
and so gently you came rapping
and so faintly you came tapping

17:55.000 --> 17:56.700
tapping at my chamber door.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.610
That I scarce
was sure I heard you.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.500
<i>"Here I opened wide the door;"</i>

18:01.580 --> 18:03.480
Bart:
<i>This better be good.</i>

18:03.540 --> 18:06.140
<i>"Darkness there,
and nothing more."</i>

18:06.210 --> 18:07.940
Huh?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.650
Bart:
You know what would have been
scarier than nothing?

18:09.720 --> 18:10.450
What?

18:10.520 --> 18:11.760
Anything!

18:11.820 --> 18:13.760
<i>"Back into the chamber turning</i>

18:13.820 --> 18:15.860
<i>"all my soul within me burning</i>

18:15.920 --> 18:19.720
<i>"Soon again I heard a tapping,

18:19.790 --> 18:20.890
Surely

18:20.960 --> 18:21.870
" <i>said I</i>

18:21.930 --> 18:23.170
surely that is something

18:23.230 --> 18:25.070
at my window-lattice;

18:25.130 --> 18:26.630
Let me see then,
what thereat is

18:26.700 --> 18:28.170
and this mystery explore.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.210
<i>"Open here I flung the shutter</i>

<i>"When, with many

18:32.110 --> 18:33.440
<i>"in there stepped
a stately raven</i>

18:33.510 --> 18:34.980
<i>"of the saintly days of yore.</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:36.440
<i>"Not the least obeisance

<i>"Not a minute

<i>"but with mien of lord or lady

door--</i>

18:41.820 --> 18:45.060
<i>"Perched upon a bust of pallas
just above my chamber door--</i>

18:45.120 --> 18:47.860
<i>"perched, and sat,

18:47.920 --> 18:49.550
Though thy crest

<i>"I said</i>

wandering from
the nightly shore

18:57.970 --> 18:58.970
Tell me

18:59.030 --> 19:01.300
tell me
what thy lordly name is

on the night's
Plutonian shore.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.310
Eat my shorts.

19:05.370 --> 19:06.330

19:06.410 --> 19:07.950
<i>He says "Nevermore"</i>

19:08.010 --> 19:09.550
and that's all he'll ever say.

Bart:
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

19:12.050 --> 19:13.650
Ooh.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.920
Hmm.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.950
<i>"Then methought

D-oh! Stupid censer.

<i>"...swung by seraphim</i>

Leave my loneliness unbroken!

Quit the bust above my door!

20:36.760 --> 20:37.990
Arrghh!

20:38.070 --> 20:39.670
Eeyough!

20:39.730 --> 20:41.360
I got him!

20:41.440 --> 20:42.740
Got him..!

20:42.800 --> 20:43.860
Yarrugh!

20:43.940 --> 20:44.880
Ow!

20:44.940 --> 20:45.910
Doh!

20:45.970 --> 20:47.430
<i>"And the raven</i>

20:47.510 --> 20:48.750

20:48.810 --> 20:50.180
<i>"still is sitting</i>

20:50.240 --> 20:53.070
<i>"still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas</i>

20:53.150 --> 20:54.850
<i>"just above my chamber door;</i>

20:54.920 --> 20:57.090

21:03.260 --> 21:05.500

21:10.330 --> 21:12.640
Heh, heh, heh.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.640
Lisa, that wasn't scary.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.100
Not even for a poem.

21:17.170 --> 21:19.240
Well it was written in 1845.

21:19.310 --> 21:21.650
Maybe people were easier to
scare back then.

21:21.710 --> 21:24.980
Oh yeah. Like when you look
at <i>Friday the 13th, Part One.</i>

21:25.050 --> 21:27.720
It's pretty tame
by today's standards.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.720
Marge:
<i>Children, bedtime!</i>

21:29.780 --> 21:32.980
I'll guess I'll have no trouble
getting to sleep tonight.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.760
( <i>panting )</i>

21:37.830 --> 21:40.300
( quivering )

21:49.870 --> 21:51.510
Oh, no, Marge!

21:51.570 --> 21:53.200
Come on, <i>please.</i>

21:53.270 --> 21:56.170
Homer, I'm not sleeping
with the lights on.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.140
They're just
children's stories.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.340
They can't hurt you.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.450

22:05.590 --> 22:07.060
Heh, heh, heh!

22:07.120 --> 22:08.190
Oh...

22:08.260 --> 22:10.390
Oh, I hate Halloween.

22:10.460 --> 22:13.200
