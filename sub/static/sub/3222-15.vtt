WEBVTT

00:03.136 --> 00:05.627
There's a new leader rising in the west.

00:05.838 --> 00:08.306
Hi, Dean. It's me, Lilith.

00:08.474 --> 00:10.135
I don't think I like you anymore.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.772
I'm gonna put up a barrier
inside your mind.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.578
- Don't scratch the wall.
- Maybe I'm not real.

00:20.753 --> 00:22.220
I'm not going anywhere, Sam.

00:23.422 --> 00:25.117
Damn. Unh.

00:25.291 --> 00:29.227
Aren't you full up playing Snuffleupagus
with the devil all the live-long?

00:29.395 --> 00:32.228
I don't know, Bobby.
Seeing Lucifer's fine with me.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.792
At least all my crazy's under
one umbrella.

00:56.756 --> 00:59.919
Ms. Havelock.
You shouldn't have come.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.120
I needed to see it for myself.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.698
After all that tracking,
all those hours we spent.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.631
I mean, it's one thing
to study them in books, it's...

01:27.019 --> 01:29.146
Do I smell menopause?

01:29.989 --> 01:33.891
Well, if it isn't the Wiccan bitch
of the west.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.221
Ms. Havelock.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.989
I know you're the one that helped them
find me.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.395
My God.

01:42.568 --> 01:46.368
Not in time to save our big girl here,
but still.

01:46.539 --> 01:47.870
You get a merit badge.

01:50.943 --> 01:53.503
They caught you, you son of a bitch.

01:53.679 --> 01:55.874
No more murders.

01:56.048 --> 01:57.310
You're going back to hell.

01:57.483 --> 02:00.350
Oh, Nora. Nora...

02:00.519 --> 02:05.582
...I'm gonna scoop you out
like a pumpkin, you know that?

02:15.701 --> 02:19.330
Yeah, your, uh,
scooping days are over, Gomer.

02:19.505 --> 02:22.668
All you gotta worry about now is us.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.482
You ain't the first demon
we've tracked down on this safari.

02:32.018 --> 02:34.543
That's right.
I think you put us over half a dozen.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.382
Looking for Lilith
in all the wrong places.

02:37.556 --> 02:39.751
Well, you're gonna help us with that.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.292
If things are about to get messy...

02:42.528 --> 02:46.862
...maybe you should meet the owner
of this fleshy temple.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.126
A puppy of a man.

02:49.368 --> 02:51.632
You'll like him.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.240
Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Is that you?

03:03.416 --> 03:06.908
Oh, God. No.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.710
- You have to stop him.
- We will.

03:09.889 --> 03:13.620
We're going to, okay? We're gonna send
that demon back to hell.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.590
Okay.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.121
Please don't hurt me.

03:20.032 --> 03:23.229
Jeffrey, before we can let him go...

03:24.637 --> 03:27.663
Look, the demon knows where we can
find more of his kind, okay?

03:29.075 --> 03:31.976
See, we're, uh, hunting them.

03:32.144 --> 03:33.236
All of them.

03:33.412 --> 03:36.108
He's not gonna give up
his Rolodex easy.

03:36.282 --> 03:39.046
Jeffrey, were gonna have to cut
in to him.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.054
That means you.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.631
The things he made me do
to those women.

03:59.505 --> 04:02.030
Whatever you have to do...

04:02.208 --> 04:04.676
...you have to do it.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.106
Please.

04:06.278 --> 04:08.473
Just stop this evil piece of...

04:11.550 --> 04:15.486
And on and on and on.

04:16.389 --> 04:21.349
Frankly, he can get tedious
with this whole good-and-evil thing.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.158
You know, you were right.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.992
I like Jeffrey. He's a decent guy.

04:27.166 --> 04:31.159
Fact, he just signed off on his temple.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.688
She's got other lieutenants.
We already know that.

04:55.861 --> 04:57.055
We want names.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.664
All right.

05:09.842 --> 05:14.541
His name is Merrick, I swear!

05:14.713 --> 05:16.840
You'll find him in New Orleans.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.470
Jeffrey?

05:41.974 --> 05:43.100
Jeffrey, you awake?

05:45.211 --> 05:47.372
Hey. You passed out.
You're in shock.

05:47.546 --> 05:51.107
- He's gone.
- We exorcised him.

05:51.283 --> 05:54.275
Try not to move, okay?
We're almost at the hospital.

05:57.923 --> 05:59.584
Your brother.

05:59.758 --> 06:02.454
My brother stayed back, clean us out
of that crime scene.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.722
No reason to go down for a demon's
murder, you know what I mean?

06:14.573 --> 06:17.235
All right, all right.
Take it easy.

06:18.444 --> 06:21.140
All right. You're good to make it
from here, right?

06:21.313 --> 06:24.680
Okay, Jeffrey, no demon talk in the ER.
You understand me?

06:24.850 --> 06:25.942
You were mugged.

06:27.419 --> 06:28.943
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:29.121 --> 06:31.646
Uh, um, uh...

06:31.824 --> 06:33.815
Thank you.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.780
Classified server?

06:55.948 --> 06:57.347
That's gotta be Devereaux.

06:58.984 --> 07:01.009
Hello.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.381
Thank God.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.989
Frank.
Frank, what do you got for me?

07:05.157 --> 07:06.317
It's nice.

07:06.992 --> 07:09.620
Kind of like a men's room with beds.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.298
Hmm, avocado grime.

07:17.069 --> 07:21.028
Takes years to build up
a patina like this.

07:23.375 --> 07:27.038
What do you mean you can't find
him? It's Dick Roman. Turn on CNN.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.807
You see him at that, uh,
press conference in Phoenix?

07:29.982 --> 07:31.279
The bastard's everywhere.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.383
You're sure?

07:36.855 --> 07:38.345
No, I don't...

07:39.391 --> 07:43.327
I don't care that they've infiltrated
the luxury-boat industry, Frank.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.895
Great. Call Kanye.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.330
- Frank's still stumped on Roman?
- Yeah.

07:49.501 --> 07:50.934
All right. Let's do this.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.401
Okay. Um, so look at the victim profiles.

07:53.572 --> 07:56.700
Same age, same hair color, body type.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.843
Ritual mutilations line up exactly.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.946
Who down there would've let
our demon out of the can?

08:02.748 --> 08:05.444
He squealed on his superiors.
We made sure of that.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.212
I mean, he should be down under
until, uh, trumpet day.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.878
But two killed in two weeks.
Same parts missing.

08:11.056 --> 08:13.081
I mean,
same old hunting grounds even.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.022
All right.
We can take a swing at it.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.253
But it's all about
the Leviathans now. Okay?

08:17.429 --> 08:19.590
They're the ones
we need to be hunting.

08:20.432 --> 08:23.060
Yeah. But no.
I mean, not right now.

08:23.602 --> 08:27.368
This one is ours, Dean.
It's unfinished business, apparently.

08:28.607 --> 08:30.074
All right.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.442
<i>This is Unit 32...</i>

08:33.611 --> 08:35.842
<i>...repeat, Unit 32,
we've got another one.</i>

08:36.381 --> 08:37.746
<i>It's a 187.</i>

08:37.916 --> 08:39.712
<i>Female, Caucasian, maybe late 30s.</i>

08:39.885 --> 08:41.716
<i>At the Henley Auto-Wash.</i>

08:41.886 --> 08:44.287
<i>Unit 32, assistance is en route.</i>

08:44.456 --> 08:46.822
<i>We got a real mess here, Dispatch.</i>

08:52.865 --> 08:55.459
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.000
Every time we do this
I wonder if today's the day.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.298
Flash our tin to a bunch of
chompers pretending to be policemen.

09:01.473 --> 09:05.136
- I hear you.
- Thought you guys might show up.

09:05.311 --> 09:11.341
It's the drummer boys.
Agents, uh, Bonham and Watts, right?

09:11.517 --> 09:13.815
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.784
Uh, it's a pleasure to see you again,
Detective...

09:16.955 --> 09:18.786
- Sutton.
- You know what, pardon me...

09:18.957 --> 09:22.120
...uh, what was it? Detective...
Sutton.

09:22.294 --> 09:24.524
Oh, no problemo. Detective Sutton.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.790
- Sutton.
- Sutton, yeah. Hi.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.000
Sad to say,
case looks to be open again.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.195
Are you sure?

09:34.306 --> 09:40.040
Same tools, same cuts, same crazy.

09:41.613 --> 09:45.515
Makes sense. I mean, we didn't catch
the critter last time, did we?

09:45.684 --> 09:48.016
- And no suspects?
- Same as before.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.914
Very thorough.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.182
Cold-blooded.

09:56.228 --> 09:59.129
- Thank you, detective.
- Anytime.

10:05.804 --> 10:06.964
Hey.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.633
- Sulfur.
- Damn it.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.573
Better go check on Havelock.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.443
This is it.

10:23.055 --> 10:26.218
- Wiccansweb. Com.
- Internet mail order.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.383
White magic only, ha, ha.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.357
Herbs and talismans.

10:35.334 --> 10:39.703
- You're sure about that?
- Uh, careful. It's still drying.

10:41.039 --> 10:44.998
I have a friend at the sheriff's office.
I know about all the new murders.

10:45.177 --> 10:48.044
I'm doing
what I can to protect myself.

10:48.714 --> 10:53.845
I'm also translating some very old
banishments.

10:59.391 --> 11:04.454
- Wow, uh, these are good.
- Thanks. I've got an affinity.

11:04.630 --> 11:07.394
But back then, that night,
in that farmhouse?

11:07.566 --> 11:11.229
I was in over my head. I know that now.
I'll leave that to the pros.

11:11.403 --> 11:13.394
You helped track it down.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.199
It was some solid legwork.

11:15.374 --> 11:16.966
All I really knew was somebody...

11:17.142 --> 11:19.804
...who knew somebody who knew
the right number to call.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.071
And your number is not working,
by the way.

11:22.247 --> 11:26.581
Right. Uh, we've had some
technical difficulties. Phone issues.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.016
It's a monster problem, really.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.757
So, uh, you haven't had any contact?

11:32.925 --> 11:36.053
With the demon? No, thank God.

11:36.228 --> 11:39.391
I have one or two things to finish
in town, and then I'm leaving.

11:39.565 --> 11:40.759
Good choice.

11:41.266 --> 11:43.962
Have you found Jeffrey yet?

11:44.136 --> 11:45.660
Who?

11:46.438 --> 11:50.738
The man who the demon possessed.
The one you almost beat to death.

11:50.909 --> 11:55.073
Yeah. Jeffrey. That poor bastard.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.940
Some demons tend
to be sentimental, don't they?

11:59.117 --> 12:01.779
Always go back to the same host,
if they can.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.319
It's a start.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.517
I wanna talk about Cinemax.

12:07.693 --> 12:11.629
We're grown men, we pay rent,
why can't we get Cinemax?

12:13.131 --> 12:15.190
- Skin-emax.
- The halfway program advisors...

12:15.367 --> 12:17.130
...have already weighed
in on that.

12:17.302 --> 12:19.031
- Fine.
- Bringing it up in group...

12:19.204 --> 12:20.865
I said fine.

12:22.140 --> 12:25.871
Jeffrey. You have something pretty big
going down later this morning.

12:26.078 --> 12:30.674
That's right. I guess.
Um, I'm picking her up today.

12:30.849 --> 12:33.682
I'm getting a dog. A rescue.

12:33.852 --> 12:39.051
I had to get her spayed and shots
and stuff, but they said she's ready.

12:39.224 --> 12:40.851
Jeffrey and I talked about this.

12:41.026 --> 12:45.292
He understands that pet ownership
is a privilege, not a right.

12:45.464 --> 12:49.059
He's gonna have to show the house
that he can handle the responsibility.

12:49.234 --> 12:52.397
And that's what it's all about,
right, Alan?

12:52.604 --> 12:53.969
Handling it.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.009
- Bye.
- You okay there, huh?

12:58.610 --> 13:01.044
Surgery is a bucket of laughs, huh?

13:01.213 --> 13:02.874
You look good.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.882
Sorry for the cone of shame,
but we gotta keep these stitches in.

13:08.253 --> 13:10.881
Okay, okay.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.923
Come on. Come on.

13:43.388 --> 13:45.652
- Jeffrey.
- Jeffrey.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.850
- Hey. Okay. Look, it's okay.
- You're okay. You're okay.

13:49.027 --> 13:51.427
I'm sorry.
We just had to make sure.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.794
Make sure of what?
That I peed my pants today?

13:58.203 --> 14:01.195
Aw, you scared my dog.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.466
Uh, we did not wanna do that.

14:04.943 --> 14:07.241
Listen, Jeff. We gotta, uh, talk.

14:11.650 --> 14:16.246
- Well, this is, uh...
- I know what it is.

14:17.689 --> 14:20.658
Look, I know it must've been, um, hard.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.027
Do you even listen to yourself?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.493
Oh, don't bother.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.798
What do you guys want from me?

14:31.970 --> 14:38.034
Well, uh, we're pretty sure the demon
that possessed you is back.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.507
What?

14:40.512 --> 14:42.309
What do you mean?

14:42.481 --> 14:45.041
You exorcised him, right?

14:47.519 --> 14:49.919
He's supposed to be in hell.

14:50.088 --> 14:53.990
Jeffrey, look, please, just calm down.
Just have a seat. Please.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.093
I don't understand.

14:56.294 --> 14:58.660
Three more women have been murdered
over the past two weeks.

14:58.830 --> 15:00.195
No, no.

15:00.365 --> 15:04.529
Same vic profiles, same forensics,
crime scene dusted with sulfur.

15:04.703 --> 15:07.604
- We've gotta assume that it's him.
- But were here now, okay?

15:07.806 --> 15:10.707
If he comes after you, we'll nail him,
like we did last time.

15:11.343 --> 15:12.935
What was her name?

15:13.111 --> 15:16.274
- What?
- The last one he killed.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.542
- Uh, Anna.
- Anna Paxton.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.016
Marjorie Willis.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.350
- She's the next one on the list.
- The list? What list?

15:25.524 --> 15:29.119
The demon used to recite it all the time.
Like a grocery list.

15:29.327 --> 15:34.196
He burned it in my head, the names
of all the women he was going to kill.

15:34.366 --> 15:38.564
- He already had his victims chosen?
- And put in a line, in an order.

15:38.737 --> 15:39.931
Wait, why?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.972
Demons aren't usually
into the obsessive-serial-killer crap.

15:43.141 --> 15:45.632
You know, they're more just
kind of all-around evil.

15:45.844 --> 15:46.902
Why would he do this?

15:48.413 --> 15:50.540
He said it was his job.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.659
Jeffrey? Did your, uh, guests sign in?

16:03.395 --> 16:04.623
I'm really sorry, Alan.

16:04.796 --> 16:08.232
They're friends of mine
from my days back at the post office.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.994
- I didn't know they were coming.
- What do you think?

16:11.169 --> 16:14.138
I think we really helped mess
this poor son of a bitch up.

16:14.873 --> 16:17.501
Look at him,
he's got a state-assigned dad.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.008
Just get them to sign in
when they sign out.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.149
Uh, Jeffrey, look, I'm gonna go, uh...

16:28.320 --> 16:31.016
I'm gonna go find Marjorie Willis,
keep her on watch.

16:31.189 --> 16:33.521
Don't worry. I'm gonna stay here.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.989
Just in case.

16:46.671 --> 16:48.002
Excuse me.

16:52.778 --> 16:56.145
You're right.
We just don't read anymore.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.179
Marjorie Willis.

17:00.352 --> 17:05.346
Librarian, indoor gardening enthusiast,
our demon's next organ donor.

17:18.136 --> 17:23.574
Hello. Yes, it's on the upper floor.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.336
- Just take the stairs to your left.
- Great, thanks.

17:28.747 --> 17:31.580
Come on, Sam. Talk to me.
It's been months.

17:39.724 --> 17:43.558
When you left me at the ER,
I had three smashed fingers...

17:43.728 --> 17:48.893
...five teeth out, a broken wrist,
nose, cheekbone, collarbone.

17:49.067 --> 17:53.504
I had to get 160 stitches.
Heh, mugged.

17:53.672 --> 17:57.870
The doctor on duty said it looked like
I got caught in the Spanish Inquisition.

17:58.043 --> 18:01.877
- Yeah, and we're the good guys.
- They patched me up, mostly...

18:02.047 --> 18:05.915
...but I lost my job,
my health insurance.

18:06.484 --> 18:11.421
I just started to drink, and drift,
and I got lost.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.081
Had some kind of mental break.

18:15.126 --> 18:16.923
And I started to talk.

18:17.095 --> 18:20.030
- About what happened.
- Oh, man.

18:20.198 --> 18:24.066
Never tell. Never, never.

18:24.236 --> 18:28.263
- I know that now. Believe me.
- So let me guess.

18:28.440 --> 18:33.070
Drunk tank to psych eval
to 72-hour forced hold...

18:33.245 --> 18:35.873
...to nice long stay
at an institution of their choice.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.272
Yes.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.746
It's happened to friends of mine.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.751
And for a long time I didn't care.

18:43.922 --> 18:46.789
The truth was more important
than where I was.

18:46.958 --> 18:50.450
I was in no shape to cope
with the outside world.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.223
Well, hey, you got out.

18:53.398 --> 18:56.959
- You know, you're pulling it together.
- And now the demon is back.

18:57.135 --> 19:00.468
Yeah. I'm sorry, man.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.268
I mean it.

19:03.441 --> 19:05.306
About all of it. You know?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.172
You saved my life.

19:08.346 --> 19:10.473
I owe you for it, I know that.

19:10.649 --> 19:14.176
I owe a lot of people
for getting even this far.

19:14.352 --> 19:16.183
I...

19:19.491 --> 19:21.755
- Crap.
- What?

19:21.927 --> 19:24.088
If he isn't already circling
the next woman...

19:24.262 --> 19:28.323
...Marjorie, then I think I might
know where he is.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.800
He had this special place.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.303
Where he kept souvenirs.
Where he nested.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.768
- Why didn't you tell us this?
- I didn't wanna go.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.471
- You don't have to go. We'll handle it.
- I do. I have to.

19:45.283 --> 19:48.150
Average annual rainfall,
Hackberry, Texas.

20:24.189 --> 20:27.420
Come on, Sam. Pay attention to me.
I'm bored.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.725
Civil War buff?

20:48.513 --> 20:50.777
Damn it. No service.

20:53.518 --> 20:56.351
Good girl. You stay.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.579
Here's some jerky.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.255
Stay.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.455
That thing's not gonna pee in here,
is it?

21:05.630 --> 21:08.258
Um, I don't know.

21:18.209 --> 21:20.871
He'd get you this far,
then he'd shut your lights out?

21:21.046 --> 21:24.982
For some reason
he's very secretive about this place.

21:25.183 --> 21:29.449
But after a while, he'd only really sort
of cover my eyes when we walked in.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.748
Okay. You think you can
get us back there?

21:38.630 --> 21:39.961
Right here.

21:40.131 --> 21:41.325
In my discontinued periodicals.

21:44.936 --> 21:46.460
That's it.

22:00.785 --> 22:04.016
Red door, down the hallway.

22:04.522 --> 22:06.319
Yeah, there is.

22:26.111 --> 22:28.477
This must be it.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.518
All right, stay over here.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.061
Okay?

22:46.264 --> 22:48.289
Just stay here, don't move.

23:03.681 --> 23:05.876
What the hell?

23:28.573 --> 23:29.665
Hey.

23:31.442 --> 23:35.173
Hey. Hey. All right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

23:36.614 --> 23:38.343
Hey. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

23:38.516 --> 23:39.574
You gotta stay still.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.922
I'm pretty sure this guy's the boring
sort of chubby chaser.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.468
<i>Leave your name,
number and nightmare at the tone.</i>

24:01.639 --> 24:05.075
Dean, where are you?
I'm scoping zero out here.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.371
Not a good sign.

24:14.819 --> 24:15.843
Hmm.

24:16.020 --> 24:18.750
I'm surprised
you haven't picked up on that yet.

24:19.657 --> 24:23.650
It's right there
in the coroner's report.

24:26.564 --> 24:27.895
Yeah.

24:28.700 --> 24:31.567
Uh-huh, in this latest round of killings...

24:31.736 --> 24:35.604
...our big girls had traces
of heavy tranquilizers in their blood.

24:35.773 --> 24:37.934
Yeah.
But our demon's strong enough...

24:38.109 --> 24:41.374
...to make Fat Betty do whatever
he wants to, right?

24:41.546 --> 24:44.947
So why does he need the tranqs?
Think he's got a bad back?

24:46.084 --> 24:48.848
Yeah. Whatever is going on here...

24:49.020 --> 24:52.456
...you know that demon's
not coming back to kill anybody.

24:56.094 --> 24:58.085
<i>This is Special Agent Smith.</i>

24:58.263 --> 24:59.525
<i>Please leave your name, number...</i>

24:59.697 --> 25:02.495
Oh, wow, that's every cell phone
Dean's got.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.498
One of them
should've picked up, right?

25:04.669 --> 25:07.160
- Big brother's probably dead.
- Shut up.

25:15.813 --> 25:18.111
He said "shut up" to me.

25:22.820 --> 25:27.189
That's what I'm talking about,
Sam. Real interaction again. I miss that.

25:27.358 --> 25:29.849
The rapier wit, the wittier rape.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.189
Come on, ha, ha.

25:33.464 --> 25:35.364
I'll be good.

25:36.301 --> 25:40.294
I'll even help you solve your little
Nancy Drew mystery or whatever.

25:43.141 --> 25:44.733
No note.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.745
Hmm, a cell phone scrambler.

25:52.950 --> 25:55.145
"But, Lucy, those are illegal,"
thinks Sam.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.086
Maybe this has something to do
with Dean's telephone blackout.

26:33.491 --> 26:36.858
Hmm, Latin. Not suspicious at all.

26:37.929 --> 26:42.730
- I've never seen this spell before.
- No. But you've seen this type.

26:44.001 --> 26:46.231
A demon summoning. Why?

26:46.404 --> 26:49.373
Why? To summon a demon, jackass.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.599
Start looking at who.

26:55.213 --> 26:56.737
Okay, what do you mean?

26:56.914 --> 26:58.745
Look at the page.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.255
- You know this handwriting.
- I know this handwriting.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.356
Nora, stop it. Calm down.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.827
What is this? What is this?

27:47.999 --> 27:51.127
Why did Jeffrey have a demon
summoning in your handwriting?

27:51.302 --> 27:53.930
Everything's happening
the way he planned it.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.335
- What plan?
- You can't help.

27:56.507 --> 27:58.600
- You can't change it.
- Hit her.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.305
Nora.

28:01.479 --> 28:04.380
- Tell me what is going on.
- Sam, shake her up.

28:04.582 --> 28:08.177
She knows what happened to Dean.
Get this stupid cow to focus, will you?

28:08.352 --> 28:11.947
Nora, listen to me. Whatever it is,
you should be more scared of me...

28:12.123 --> 28:14.785
...because I'm two inches away,
and I can make you talk.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.824
Do you understand me?

28:19.997 --> 28:21.362
It's my son.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.230
He has my son.

28:26.404 --> 28:27.735
What were you thinking?

28:27.905 --> 28:30.703
Why'd you even help bring back
a demon in the first place?

28:30.875 --> 28:32.968
Not the demon.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.203
Jeffrey.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.248
Jeffrey?

28:46.757 --> 28:48.247
Good.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.053
You're up.

28:51.395 --> 28:52.987
What happened? What's going on?

28:53.164 --> 28:55.223
No one asked you to get involved.

28:55.399 --> 28:58.425
To save me. To save anyone.

28:58.636 --> 29:00.331
- What?
- Did you ever think...

29:00.505 --> 29:03.872
...that maybe I loved
being possessed?

29:04.041 --> 29:07.169
Did you?
I loved the connection...

29:07.345 --> 29:10.405
...the power, and I loved him.

29:11.649 --> 29:13.913
Love of my life, actually.

29:14.085 --> 29:17.054
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
- He liberated me.

29:18.656 --> 29:21.557
Started me on my true life mission.

29:21.726 --> 29:25.662
So you're the one with the thing for all
those women, aren't you, Jeffrey?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.726
You're a serial killer.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.960
I was nothing before he found me.

29:32.169 --> 29:37.072
A shadow. Too scared to do
what I was brought here to do...

29:37.241 --> 29:39.766
...too timid to live up to
my true potential.

29:41.412 --> 29:42.640
So, what happened?

29:42.813 --> 29:46.078
Redheaded mommy make you
stuff birds and put on dresses?

29:46.250 --> 29:48.718
You shouldn't trivialize
other people's pain.

29:48.886 --> 29:55.553
So demon comes along, rides co-pilot
in your skull, teaches you how to kill.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.624
The list, that's yours.

29:59.797 --> 30:03.426
For years, it was just a game
I would play.

30:03.601 --> 30:06.832
Every time I'd walk by one of them
in the street...

30:07.004 --> 30:09.802
...or see one on my mail route...

30:10.841 --> 30:14.743
There's a sound that comes
from their brains, you know that?

30:14.912 --> 30:16.573
Only I can hear it.

30:16.747 --> 30:18.908
Like an evil little steam whistle.

30:20.585 --> 30:27.149
Every time I saw one, I'd follow her,
take down her address.

30:30.861 --> 30:34.353
But I was never gonna do anything.
Not till he came along.

30:35.466 --> 30:38.333
He's the one who saved me.

30:39.804 --> 30:41.135
And you sent him to hell.

30:41.839 --> 30:44.501
I kept tabs on Jeffrey
after the exorcism...

30:44.675 --> 30:48.441
...I even sent him care packages
in the hospital. But he never responded.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.945
And then not long ago,
he came to me.

30:51.115 --> 30:53.447
He seemed healthy, put together.

30:53.618 --> 30:56.985
Except he wanted to know if there
was a way to summon the demon back.

30:57.154 --> 30:58.485
He'd been doing research.

30:58.656 --> 31:01.318
Mostly nonsense.
But he was convinced it was possible.

31:01.492 --> 31:05.326
Hey, you really knocked the cork
out of her pie hole.

31:05.496 --> 31:09.023
I sent him away,
I told him to get some more help.

31:09.567 --> 31:13.867
The next day, he called me...

31:15.039 --> 31:17.371
...and he put my son on the phone.

31:18.042 --> 31:21.034
He had taken him from his dorm room.

31:22.213 --> 31:27.173
I gave him everything.
The ritual, the sigils.

31:28.285 --> 31:29.809
But he kept my boy.

31:34.025 --> 31:36.152
And then he sent me this.

31:42.199 --> 31:44.690
It's my baby's ear.

31:44.869 --> 31:48.430
He cut it off
because the ritual didn't work.

31:49.106 --> 31:51.597
Well, that demon
gave up some serious state secrets.

31:51.809 --> 31:53.276
Would have gone into lockdown.

31:53.444 --> 31:55.002
Not so easy
to bring him back up.

31:55.179 --> 31:58.546
Jeffrey didn't care. He told me
to find out what went wrong or else.

31:59.383 --> 32:04.946
So finally, I found a summoning spell
that would work for sure.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.457
And that's when he said
I had another job to do.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.062
Which was what?

32:14.231 --> 32:17.132
When you came, I was supposed
to send you to Jeffrey.

32:17.968 --> 32:20.334
He left a trail of bodies
to make sure of it.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.773
Blood of the exorcist.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.842
Strongest summoning I've ever seen.

32:27.411 --> 32:29.902
Requires the blood of the exorcist
who banished him.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.540
Your brother.

32:32.416 --> 32:33.474
You see?

32:33.651 --> 32:39.749
- It is all part of Jeffrey's plan.
- Yeah, well, new plan.

32:39.957 --> 32:43.654
Tracking spell. Bavarian, Egyptian,
I don't care, dealer's choice.

32:43.861 --> 32:47.592
Use the flesh of the body
to find the body and Dean.

32:48.799 --> 32:51.359
Do you want the ear? Or the kid?

32:52.069 --> 32:54.230
You're giving me the chills.

33:00.277 --> 33:03.735
I like to think I know you pretty well.

33:03.914 --> 33:05.279
Yeah, how do you figure?

33:05.449 --> 33:09.681
I watched you torture an innocent man
to get at a demon.

33:10.287 --> 33:12.812
Pretty charged situation.

33:12.990 --> 33:14.821
Revealing.

33:14.992 --> 33:20.294
You guys talked about a lot.
Showed a lot of character.

33:21.332 --> 33:27.794
God, you were so desperate
to fix the world back then.

33:27.972 --> 33:30.099
It kills you...

33:31.308 --> 33:34.300
...that people keep getting hurt...

33:34.478 --> 33:37.845
...and you just can't stop it.

33:38.015 --> 33:43.419
Or I should say it's killed you,
shouldn't I?

33:44.221 --> 33:46.781
You know what? Screw you.

33:46.957 --> 33:50.154
Hey. I was there.

33:50.327 --> 33:53.125
I was depressed, Dean.

33:53.297 --> 33:57.290
Because he was gone.

33:57.468 --> 34:02.997
I was a wreck, an emotional shell,
a drunk.

34:04.308 --> 34:08.141
- I was suicidal.
- I don't usually endorse suicide...

34:08.312 --> 34:11.839
...but, man, what stopped you?
It was Alan.

34:12.016 --> 34:14.507
- At the house.
- You're kidding me.

34:14.685 --> 34:17.984
He's a really good rehab therapist.

34:18.155 --> 34:22.751
Really helped me focus on my goals,
my attitude.

34:22.960 --> 34:27.590
I have to say, I really benefitted
from the whole program.

34:27.764 --> 34:28.857
Yeah.

34:29.033 --> 34:33.264
A life well lived comes
from the structured pursuit...

34:33.469 --> 34:36.098
...of meaningful happiness.

34:36.273 --> 34:40.505
I realized I was nothing
without my demon.

34:40.678 --> 34:43.772
Then I decided
I have to get him back.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.172
Uh...

34:47.784 --> 34:50.117
I'll be right back.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.854
Hey there, honey. Come on.

34:58.729 --> 35:02.790
It's a bitch of a recipe, I must admit.

35:04.401 --> 35:05.527
No.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.603
Oh, you sick son of a bitch.

36:20.311 --> 36:22.279
Hello, Jeffrey.

36:30.587 --> 36:31.986
Dean Winchester.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.659
As I live and breathe.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.088
Again.

36:44.668 --> 36:48.104
- What are you doing?
- I'm thanking you, Jeffrey.

36:51.608 --> 36:55.567
What are you doing
with this half-dead piece of crap?

36:55.746 --> 36:57.145
Come into me.

36:57.314 --> 37:00.340
We had a very special time together,
didn't we, Jeffrey?

37:00.517 --> 37:03.884
It warms my heart to see you
haven't forgotten what I taught you.

37:04.054 --> 37:05.146
You built on it.

37:06.890 --> 37:08.221
You captured a Winchester.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.486
You, Jeffrey.

37:11.662 --> 37:12.924
My pupil.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.694
I don't wanna be your pupil.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.356
I wanna be yours.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.928
But I'm done with you.

37:21.138 --> 37:22.196
My work is finished.

37:23.640 --> 37:27.736
You can do everything now,
all on your beautiful own.

37:27.911 --> 37:30.072
- No.
- No?

37:37.921 --> 37:39.548
We don't do "no."

37:39.723 --> 37:40.951
Remember, Jeffrey?

37:43.460 --> 37:47.157
Keep sawing away at your ropes,
Penelope Pitstop.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.164
We can dance standing up
if you want.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.426
So this is what you do?

37:52.102 --> 37:55.196
Find postal workers,
make them go postal?

37:55.372 --> 37:58.102
I talent scout. That's all.

37:58.275 --> 38:01.005
Looking for the next generation
of superstars.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.811
Before they get to hell.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.176
Like Jeffrey here.

38:07.484 --> 38:10.544
He had all the raw material...

38:10.721 --> 38:12.814
...just bubbling in there.

38:12.990 --> 38:16.084
All I had to do was loosen
the lid on his jar.

38:16.260 --> 38:19.593
- Show him some practical know-how.
- Yeah, what about the kid?

38:20.631 --> 38:22.394
This one?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.594
I don't think.

38:25.769 --> 38:28.260
Not much to work with.

38:28.705 --> 38:30.969
No natural gift.

38:31.141 --> 38:34.633
I'll probably burn this meat off
on my way to Vegas.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.360
You have got to be kidding me.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.394
You let go of my son.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.869
Ha, ha, where do you keep coming from?

39:17.354 --> 39:20.687
Ha, ha. He'll be back, you know.
Back in black.

39:20.858 --> 39:21.916
Go to hell.

39:44.047 --> 39:45.674
Mom.

39:47.151 --> 39:48.584
I got you.

39:50.787 --> 39:52.379
I got you, baby.

40:00.697 --> 40:01.721
God.

40:05.369 --> 40:09.430
So Jeffrey was just pretending
to be the victim.

40:09.606 --> 40:15.738
Way back in that farmhouse, during
the exorcism, he was just, heh, acting.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.245
He was a psychopath, Sam.

40:18.415 --> 40:22.681
That's what they do all the time, is act.

40:22.853 --> 40:29.053
Act like they're normal, act like
they're not balls-to-the-wall crazy.

40:29.226 --> 40:31.194
- You going to sleep?
- Damn straight.

40:31.361 --> 40:33.522
Screw consciousness,
that's what I say.

40:37.401 --> 40:41.599
No, no, Sam.
No nap for you, Sammy.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.569
Oh, come on. Don't do that.

40:47.644 --> 40:49.874
Let's talk, Sam.

40:50.047 --> 40:52.447
Always enjoyed our special
little chats.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.844
Don't you wanna talk?

40:55.919 --> 40:56.977
Yeah, look at that.

40:57.154 --> 40:59.281
Something's definitely different now,
isn't it?

41:01.058 --> 41:03.083
You let me in.

41:04.494 --> 41:06.724
You wanted me, partner.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.695
You think you can use your little
tricks to banish me again? Like that:

41:11.268 --> 41:13.930
Nope.
I do believe I've got you, bunk buddy.

41:14.104 --> 41:17.335
Got my finger wiggling around
in your brainpan.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.982
Come on, Sammy. Come on.

41:29.152 --> 41:30.710
Say it with me now.

41:31.688 --> 41:36.352
Good morning, Vietnam!
