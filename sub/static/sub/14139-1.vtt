WEBVTT

03:50.600 --> 03:52.850
Slow.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.700
That tickles.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.370
That tickles too.

05:00.590 --> 05:02.420
How much are you in debt?

05:05.380 --> 05:06.590
30,000.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.180
30,000 what?

05:10.260 --> 05:11.100
Dollars.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.740
A friend of mine has a bar on Ibiza.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.580
Actually, he doesn't have it yet.
He needs a partner.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.460
I could buy in.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.630
I just need 80,000.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.300
Euros?

05:48.970 --> 05:50.050
Of course.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.890
But you don't have.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.340
I'd like to meet your crowd sometime.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.190
I'm almost out.

06:45.610 --> 06:48.320
- You can get me more?
- Sure.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.750
Give him a blowjob
or have him take a Mr. Blue.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.340
That's what we've got them for.

07:50.590 --> 07:52.300
Then he'll be fine.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.760
He paid 120 euros.

07:56.430 --> 07:58.390
Hey, angel, what's wrong?

07:59.430 --> 08:01.230
Don't we say good evening anymore?

08:01.430 --> 08:02.560
Good evening.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.230
He's a regular.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.110
If he stops coming, you earn nothing,

08:07.270 --> 08:10.280
and what's more important, I earn nothing.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.580
Did she leave?

08:27.130 --> 08:28.210
Give me the card.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.460
- I didn't see her-
- It doesn't matter. The card.

09:13.590 --> 09:15.590
Baby, what is it this time?

09:16.010 --> 09:18.010
I no work today.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.010
We'll see about that.

09:20.510 --> 09:21.310
No.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.100
Come on.

09:28.310 --> 09:29.860
Today no, please.

09:42.490 --> 09:44.540
I not work today.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.580
Show pussy!

10:25.540 --> 10:27.750
Go on, lie down.
Show pussy!

10:33.090 --> 10:35.090
You really have a nice pussy.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.220
You rub a little.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.200
Well, angel.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.250
Everything okay?

11:11.250 --> 11:12.750
A short break.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.170
I want to talk to you about something.

11:16.960 --> 11:17.800
Yes.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.470
But...

11:21.760 --> 11:23.010
not here.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.060
I'll come by your place tomorrow afternoon?

11:27.140 --> 11:28.970
- Okay?
- Yes.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.400
Don't say anything to the other girls.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.850
Hello, sweetheart.

12:08.930 --> 12:10.310
How much?

12:10.850 --> 12:13.480
Come inside and tell me what you want.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.310
I wanna fuck.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.730
Bye.

14:20.650 --> 14:21.810
What is?

14:24.610 --> 14:25.650
What you doing here?

14:25.820 --> 14:27.070
Secret entrance.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.410
You must leave. Boss coming.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.740
Konecny?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.410
What does he want?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.000
He say talk.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.410
About what?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.330
I don't know. Talk.

14:44.590 --> 14:47.630
I don't know what he want.
He say talk.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.340
- Are you coming over afterwards?
- Yes.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.430
Are you coming over afterwards?

14:56.180 --> 14:57.180
Go!

15:01.440 --> 15:03.020
It's me, angel.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.450
I coming.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.380
Angel, what's going on?

15:32.890 --> 15:34.550
Weren't you dressed?

15:35.140 --> 15:37.140
That wouldn't have bothered me.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.730
I've been observing you.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.690
You're a smart girl.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.900
Not as stupid as the others.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.150
You have goals,

15:50.700 --> 15:53.070
plans in life, am I right?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.160
I like that.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.410
And I've been thinking about how to help you.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.170
Come on, sit down.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.590
I own a few flats. Nice ones.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.260
Living room, bedroom, kitchen,
everything, tip-top.

16:15.430 --> 16:17.260
You follow what I'm saying?

16:19.060 --> 16:20.850
And one of these flats

16:21.560 --> 16:23.100
has your name on it.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.100
You can leave this hotel room behind.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.860
How does that sound?

16:30.900 --> 16:32.530
How much?

16:32.610 --> 16:34.740
We'll see. Not more than this place.

16:36.950 --> 16:38.280
I have friends, you see.

16:38.450 --> 16:41.200
Politicians, big industry people, etc.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.960
Sometimes they want to relax

16:44.120 --> 16:45.790
with a pretty girl.

16:46.210 --> 16:48.420
They don't like brothels,

16:48.960 --> 16:50.460
on account of their image.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.130
They like it private.

16:53.630 --> 16:55.130
Exquisite.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.720
You'd earn more too.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.560
And I no more work in Cinderella?

17:08.730 --> 17:10.069
We'll see.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.480
You will at first.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.990
We'll see how things go.

17:17.990 --> 17:21.329
You're too special for a brothel.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.119
Do you have a boyfriend?

17:37.180 --> 17:38.840
All by yourself?

17:43.310 --> 17:46.270
Nobody to look after you, protect you?

17:46.600 --> 17:48.850
I don't need. I can do myself.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.230
All right then.

17:54.650 --> 17:56.700
Do we go with the flat?

17:59.160 --> 18:01.070
I must think.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.160
You do that.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.000
How about a blowjob?

18:17.300 --> 18:19.630
It would make me very happy.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.390
Well?

18:32.230 --> 18:34.230
My loss, your gain.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.000
What are you thinking?

18:54.920 --> 18:57.260
Would I really do that with you?

18:58.090 --> 19:00.930
Come on. Get up.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.720
To me you're not a whore.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.770
I was just kidding.

19:10.690 --> 19:12.270
You think about it,

19:12.520 --> 19:14.520
and I'll look after you.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.570
You can trust me.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.070
You can make something of yourself.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.260
Nice. Great.

20:28.510 --> 20:30.100
These four were great.

20:30.180 --> 20:32.270
Too fast on this one.
Take your time.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.850
Easy with the trigger finger.

20:34.100 --> 20:34.980
Thank you.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.150
Next, please.

20:43.530 --> 20:44.780
Load.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.570
Stop concentrating so hard.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.700
Commence firing.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.170
You've got night duty today?

21:03.800 --> 21:05.630
What are you going to do?

21:05.720 --> 21:07.090
Stay home.

21:07.550 --> 21:10.680
Look, old Hausner is still driving.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.230
We should alert the authorities.

21:14.390 --> 21:15.940
He has to. He's all alone.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.560
What if something happens?

21:17.650 --> 21:19.310
You're not on duty.

21:20.820 --> 21:22.150
Unfortunately not.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.570
Hey there.

22:07.110 --> 22:09.200
Well, look who came to visit.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.620
Mom called.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.450
She wants to put me in a home.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.700
She said to see if you need some help.

22:14.790 --> 22:16.620
I do fine on my own.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.790
She said to cut your firewood.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.710
I'm surprised you still know me.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.010
You didn't want anything to do with me.

22:27.090 --> 22:28.550
You missed the funeral.

22:28.630 --> 22:30.220
I couldn't make it.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.890
Even missed the funeral.

22:31.970 --> 22:34.810
I was in jail, they don't
let you go to funerals.

22:34.970 --> 22:37.060
Then you shouldn't have stolen.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.640
I don't have much time today.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.230
I have to get back to work.

22:41.810 --> 22:43.820
- You have a job?
- Yes.

22:46.070 --> 22:47.690
All right, come in then.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.000
It sure was special.

23:04.170 --> 23:06.420
The whole cemetery full of people.

23:09.590 --> 23:11.340
And the priest...

23:12.180 --> 23:14.010
spoke such beautiful words.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.690
I should get going.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.190
She was real popular.

23:25.690 --> 23:27.530
I'm kind of in a hurry today.

23:31.530 --> 23:32.860
Real popular.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.500
I'll come by next week or the week after.

23:41.710 --> 23:43.540
Do what you want.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.960
I reckon there will be something to eat.

23:47.130 --> 23:48.050
Whoops.

23:48.630 --> 23:50.050
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.300
Bye.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.550
That's Alex, my grandson.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.305
You have a grandson? I didn't know that.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.720
Yes. He lives in the city.

23:59.140 --> 24:02.060
In the city you end up
arrogant or a scoundrel.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.480
He ended up a scoundrel.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.820
I was thinking I could pick you up

24:14.990 --> 24:17.200
and we could drive to church together.

24:18.830 --> 24:21.080
You think I'm too old to drive?

24:21.660 --> 24:23.080
It's silly

24:23.330 --> 24:25.710
to drive from the same village in two cars.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.080
How long do you want to invest it?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.120
Maybe six or seven years.

25:03.290 --> 25:05.620
If there's any advantage.

25:05.790 --> 25:08.960
There is, but it's not much.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.420
The difference is 4%,

25:11.590 --> 25:12.710
4.25%.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.970
But you might be interested in this.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.180
Feeding time.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.400
It's about time.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.740
Well, angel.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.660
Have you thought about it?

27:05.490 --> 27:08.370
Good. Then I'll show you the flat tomorrow.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.540
I prefer to work here.

27:11.710 --> 27:12.920
Not in flat.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.090
No?

27:15.090 --> 27:17.050
But you'll earn more.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.760
I prefer to stay with other girls. Better.

27:21.180 --> 27:23.720
Nonsense. Keep thinking.

27:23.930 --> 27:26.010
Tomorrow we'll go see the flat.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.790
You know what your problem is?

27:49.200 --> 27:51.290
No. Do I have one?

27:51.920 --> 27:53.370
You're too soft.

27:53.790 --> 27:56.960
You want to be tough, but you're not.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.760
People can tell immediately.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.470
You don't really belong. That's your problem.

28:03.970 --> 28:05.050
Too soft.

28:22.950 --> 28:24.410
Well, what's the flat like?

28:25.280 --> 28:26.780
Better than hotel.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.160
You taking it?

28:28.330 --> 28:29.130
No.

28:29.330 --> 28:30.830
Did you tell him?

28:31.750 --> 28:33.250
What did he say?

28:34.170 --> 28:36.170
He say to keep thinking.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.670
Did he want to fuck?

28:49.260 --> 28:50.770
Tell the truth.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.020
What is this?

28:56.980 --> 28:58.480
It's not loaded.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.690
What is this? Put away!

29:02.190 --> 29:03.690
It's not loaded.

29:07.530 --> 29:09.280
You were scared, right?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.790
You were scared.

29:17.540 --> 29:20.340
- Why you do that?
- I'm just messing around.

29:33.180 --> 29:34.560
I'm doing a bank.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.350
What means "I doing bank"?

29:37.560 --> 29:40.400
I go in, show them the gun,

29:41.400 --> 29:44.570
they shit bricks,
I take the money and walk out.

29:44.740 --> 29:45.740
Bullshit.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.410
Then we pay your debts and go to Spain.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.240
Bullshit.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.830
They find you and you go back in jail.

29:53.910 --> 29:55.000
That will happen.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.250
They won't catch me because I have a plan.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.710
I know the bank. I have an escape route.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.840
- I'm gonna -
- You're not gonna! Is bullshit.

30:05.090 --> 30:07.760
We have to do something.
We can't go on like this.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.970
What not go on like this?

30:11.050 --> 30:12.890
Is all perfectly normal.

30:23.110 --> 30:24.860
- Whoops.
- We found a beetle!

30:25.030 --> 30:26.030
Super.

30:26.570 --> 30:29.410
<i>Then he opened the door
and ran into the woods</i>

30:29.570 --> 30:32.070
with us on his heels.
We caught him fast.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.450
It was okay. He was scared shitless.

30:35.290 --> 30:37.960
He kept screaming, "Please don't shoot!"

30:38.210 --> 30:41.130
And cussing like a sailor.
Picko, picko!

30:42.040 --> 30:43.790
But you never know.

30:44.210 --> 30:47.300
I thought, "What if he has a gun?"
Man, was I scared!

30:48.590 --> 30:51.220
For once we get some action,
and I'm off duty.

30:51.470 --> 30:53.930
You wouldn't have caught him anyway.
Too slow.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.810
Who's slow?

31:04.230 --> 31:05.320
Cheers!

31:06.150 --> 31:07.940
Thanks for inviting us.

31:10.070 --> 31:11.280
When is it due?

31:11.450 --> 31:12.950
Any day now.

31:16.330 --> 31:18.910
Hubert told me you miscarried.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.460
In my third month.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.330
Must be horrible.

31:26.170 --> 31:28.460
I was so scared that would happen to me.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.010
We're so stupid,
we already finished the nursery.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.210
Thanks.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.380
Maybe we should adopt after all.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.630
Susi, no. It'll work out.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.670
We just have to be patient.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.800
We've been patient so long.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.720
Maybe it worked this time.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.220
How do you know?

32:18.640 --> 32:20.390
A woman feels that kind of thing.

32:23.730 --> 32:27.060
Look, adoption just causes problems later.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.070
The kid isn't ours.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.400
It's from just anybody.

32:32.570 --> 32:35.160
There's no way of predicting his character.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.700
You just can't know.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.660
You're right.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.520
<i>What you doing?</i>

33:04.600 --> 33:06.770
<i>- Come on, get out of there!
- No.</i>

33:07.610 --> 33:09.770
<i>- Please not!
- Why are you yelling?</i>

33:10.110 --> 33:12.940
<i>Stop yelling and obey.</i>

33:14.360 --> 33:16.280
I said obey!

33:16.620 --> 33:18.120
And you, fuck off!

33:19.410 --> 33:21.870
- Are we getting nervous?
- Are you crazy?

33:41.260 --> 33:42.640
Are you crazy?

33:42.810 --> 33:44.640
Calm down, pal!

33:46.650 --> 33:47.770
Stay cool.

33:51.610 --> 33:53.230
You tell me to soften her up -

33:53.400 --> 33:56.150
The man is new around here.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.450
He doesn't know how things work yet.

33:58.660 --> 34:00.160
You gotta excuse him.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.740
No. Actually, I owe you an apology.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.330
My loss, your gain.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.420
Good thing Harry's an old friend.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.790
A gentleman.

34:11.130 --> 34:13.840
I'm sure he's willing to forget everything.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.460
We'll talk about that later.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.929
Now, you apologize.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.510
- I hear that.
- Sorry.

34:21.850 --> 34:24.060
Come on. Do it properly.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.889
Shake hands.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.690
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.280
Now take our angel to the hotel.

34:37.489 --> 34:39.449
She can call it a day.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.699
And no more mistakes from you.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.659
Shut up.

34:48.330 --> 34:52.040
Tamara, he paid him to break you.

34:52.210 --> 34:55.000
I was there.
They talked like best friends.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.210
He bawled me out.

34:58.050 --> 34:59.720
Made me apologize.

35:05.060 --> 35:06.890
Why he do it?

35:11.860 --> 35:13.020
Yeah, why?

35:15.730 --> 35:17.530
Why do you think?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.250
Come here.

35:59.570 --> 36:01.450
Hello. I take walk.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.740
<i>How can someone go in and out,</i>

36:47.910 --> 36:49.490
<i>and no one notices a thing?</i>

36:50.790 --> 36:52.660
<i>She had nothing on her.</i>

36:52.910 --> 36:54.290
<i>Said she was taking a walk.</i>

36:54.460 --> 36:56.130
<i>Then why is her room cleared out?</i>

36:56.290 --> 36:58.250
<i>I don't know. She went for a walk.</i>

36:58.420 --> 37:00.000
You don't know?

37:00.170 --> 37:03.760
What do I pay you idiots for
if you don't know anything?

37:03.970 --> 37:05.800
I never left the front desk.

37:06.010 --> 37:07.600
She was just taking a walk.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.470
But now she's gone.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.520
Along with her luggage, right?

37:13.100 --> 37:14.140
Right?

37:20.610 --> 37:23.190
- Did you say anything to her?
- No.

37:26.030 --> 37:27.620
I'm not stupid.

37:31.370 --> 37:34.000
She still owes me this month's rent, 500.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.870
Who's going to pay that now?

37:39.000 --> 37:40.790
Want me to tell you?

37:41.550 --> 37:43.670
I'm deducting it from your wages,

37:43.880 --> 37:45.470
half each.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.840
You got that?

37:53.220 --> 37:54.480
Come on. Let's go.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.260
Why you back so soon?

38:32.350 --> 38:34.350
Pack your things! We gotta go.

38:34.890 --> 38:37.180
- Why?
- I'll explain later.

38:38.900 --> 38:39.850
Where we going?

38:39.940 --> 38:41.610
To a hotel. I have no idea.

38:43.230 --> 38:45.780
- Does he suspect?
- Yes. That's the problem.

38:46.030 --> 38:47.900
Please hurry up.
They're coming.

38:48.950 --> 38:50.200
Who's coming?

38:50.780 --> 38:51.950
Who do you think?

38:52.910 --> 38:55.910
Hurry up, please!
The taxi is waiting.

39:47.590 --> 39:49.090
What we do now?

40:37.890 --> 40:39.640
Come on. Let's grab some breakfast.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.810
I'm scared.

40:43.350 --> 40:45.150
Nothing can go wrong.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.560
I have bad feeling.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.070
Better to not do it.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.860
Only idiots without a plan get caught.

40:53.570 --> 40:55.070
I know a guy who -

40:57.080 --> 40:58.200
Anything else?

41:07.210 --> 41:09.750
Nothing can go wrong.
Don't be scared.

41:11.170 --> 41:12.710
I don't want to wait here.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.930
It won't take long, just a few hours.

41:15.180 --> 41:16.470
I come with you.

41:16.550 --> 41:19.560
Tamara, that's silly. You can't help me.

41:20.220 --> 41:21.600
I wait outside.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.770
Tamara, why?

41:24.100 --> 41:25.560
It's silly.

42:09.980 --> 42:11.520
Nothing can go wrong.

42:11.610 --> 42:14.110
I go in, they give me the money,
and we split.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.740
But you must not shoot.

42:15.820 --> 42:17.780
I can't shoot. It's not loaded.

42:17.950 --> 42:20.620
- How many times do I have to say it?
- Promise!

42:20.780 --> 42:22.330
It's not loaded.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.620
Not loaded.

42:43.810 --> 42:44.930
Now what?

42:47.980 --> 42:49.020
We do it.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.900
Nothing can go wrong.

43:52.580 --> 43:53.920
I'll be right back.

44:23.910 --> 44:24.910
On floor!

44:28.200 --> 44:29.370
All.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.250
On floor!

44:44.090 --> 44:45.050
All.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.090
There too.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.760
Faster.

44:52.640 --> 44:53.980
Now, on floor.

45:17.460 --> 45:20.800
Morning. This is a no standing zone.
You'll have to leave.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.960
But if you go to the main square,

45:23.130 --> 45:24.670
there's plenty of parking there.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.930
My boyfriend be right back.

45:27.010 --> 45:28.850
Where is your boyfriend?

45:28.930 --> 45:30.510
Had to make shopping.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.480
Do you have some ID, maybe a passport?

45:38.310 --> 45:39.820
My boyfriend also has.

45:43.490 --> 45:44.990
Where are you from?

45:45.200 --> 45:46.320
Ukraine.

45:46.990 --> 45:48.280
And your boyfriend?

45:49.200 --> 45:50.370
I don't know.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.200
What, you don't know?

46:18.560 --> 46:19.810
Are you crazy?

46:20.480 --> 46:22.570
- On floor!
- I won't hurt you.

46:25.070 --> 46:25.900
Please.

46:41.590 --> 46:42.710
He fired.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.600
<i>Calling all units.</i>

46:52.760 --> 46:55.430
<i>Bank robbery at the Volksbank.
One suspect, armed -</i>

46:55.600 --> 46:57.600
Gfรถhl 20 here. Come in, please.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.690
Gfรถhl 20. Come in, please.

47:04.530 --> 47:05.940
He just opened fire.

47:06.530 --> 47:08.530
Shattered our rear window.

47:11.910 --> 47:14.660
Don't be scared. They won't catch us.

47:30.470 --> 47:32.140
Tamara, what's wrong?

47:35.600 --> 47:37.100
What is it?

47:39.480 --> 47:40.980
Did he hit you?

47:44.270 --> 47:45.650
Say something!

51:25.870 --> 51:27.370
Isn't anyone here?

52:08.830 --> 52:10.160
Ah, it's you.

52:10.250 --> 52:12.250
Sleeping in broad daylight?

52:12.710 --> 52:15.420
No, I felt a little dizzy, so I lay down.

52:15.710 --> 52:17.460
Here to chop wood already?

52:17.550 --> 52:18.880
Yeah.

52:19.670 --> 52:21.010
I wanted to,

52:21.220 --> 52:23.430
but my motorcycle broke down.

52:24.430 --> 52:26.180
What do you mean broke down?

52:26.930 --> 52:30.430
The engine died.
So I came through the woods on foot.

52:30.940 --> 52:33.230
- You want some schnapps?
- No.

52:35.440 --> 52:36.940
Can you lend me your car?

52:38.110 --> 52:39.280
My car?

52:40.030 --> 52:42.900
I have to go to Vienna, straighten things out.

52:43.610 --> 52:44.700
My car?

52:44.950 --> 52:46.070
I don't know.

52:49.410 --> 52:52.410
Take care of things.
I won't be long, a few hours.

52:52.790 --> 52:54.290
I'll be back tonight.

52:55.630 --> 52:57.460
What's wrong with the engine?

53:30.660 --> 53:31.790
What's wrong?

53:32.660 --> 53:33.580
What?

53:33.660 --> 53:35.080
What could be wrong?

53:35.170 --> 53:36.580
How should I know?

53:36.670 --> 53:38.670
Nothing, everything's fine.

53:39.420 --> 53:41.000
Dinner's almost ready.

53:53.930 --> 53:55.690
Come on, Robert. Tell me.

53:56.690 --> 53:59.110
- What?
- Something's wrong. I can tell.

53:59.270 --> 54:00.690
Come on. Out with it.

54:02.480 --> 54:05.150
It's nothing special. Rough day, that's all.

54:05.530 --> 54:06.700
Bank robbery.

54:07.450 --> 54:08.700
What, in our village?

54:09.530 --> 54:12.040
They got away with almost 50,000 euros.

54:12.660 --> 54:13.830
My goodness!

54:18.630 --> 54:20.840
I ran into them by chance and...

54:22.000 --> 54:23.710
tried to detain them, but

54:24.010 --> 54:25.800
they jumped in the car and were gone.

54:25.880 --> 54:27.380
You ran into them?

54:27.470 --> 54:28.470
By chance.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.220
Were they armed?

54:35.180 --> 54:36.390
Oh, my gosh.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.730
It's not that bad.
We'll catch them eventually.

54:43.230 --> 54:46.860
You ran into armed suspects,
and you didn't tell me until now?

54:47.400 --> 54:48.910
Nothing happened.

54:51.740 --> 54:53.330
Were there a lot of them?

54:53.870 --> 54:55.450
A man and a woman.

54:57.250 --> 55:00.250
Okay, you ran into them,
and did they threaten you?

55:00.330 --> 55:03.540
Let's drop it.
I'm glad to be off duty now.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.050
And like I said, nothing happened.

55:12.930 --> 55:14.220
I'll get it.

55:18.890 --> 55:20.230
Kargl, hello?

55:21.560 --> 55:22.560
Yes, he's here.

55:23.730 --> 55:24.940
Robert, it's for you.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
Yes?

55:41.290 --> 55:43.960
Yes, I'll be right there. In about 25 minutes.

55:46.550 --> 55:47.590
Yes, all right.

55:55.260 --> 55:56.310
What happened?

55:57.140 --> 55:59.100
I have to go to the state police office.

55:59.270 --> 56:00.730
Now? Why?

56:01.770 --> 56:03.480
They found the getaway car.

56:04.270 --> 56:06.320
You have to go to the city for that?

56:06.480 --> 56:08.070
I'll explain it to you later.

56:12.410 --> 56:14.070
Yes, that was her.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.830
No doubt in your mind?

56:16.660 --> 56:17.740
And who is she?

56:17.830 --> 56:19.750
No ID on her.

56:19.830 --> 56:23.210
I doubt she was even registered.

56:24.170 --> 56:25.920
Maybe they argued about money,

56:26.000 --> 56:27.590
and the bank robber shot her.

56:27.670 --> 56:31.340
From behind? Through the rear window?
With a Glock? No.

56:32.840 --> 56:34.430
I aimed at the tires.

56:34.510 --> 56:37.180
Yeah, shit happens.

59:50.210 --> 59:51.790
You have a visitor today?

59:51.880 --> 59:53.330
Yes, Alex.

59:53.960 --> 59:55.290
He's chopping wood.

59:55.380 --> 59:56.880
- We met once.
- Really?

59:56.960 --> 59:59.720
Yes, briefly at the farm, in the doorway.

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:02.010
- You must be glad.
- Yep.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.220
Hear about the robbery yesterday?

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:05.510
What robbery?

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.010
They robbed the bank.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:07.890
Our bank?

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.310
Robert ran into them. Just imagine!

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.730
He tried to detain them.
They were armed.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.230
- I hate to think about it.
- Robert?

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.150
- Was he hurt?
- No, thank God.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.320
There was a casualty.
I'll tell you tomorrow when I pick you up.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.200
I like these best.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.710
Is her husband a policeman?

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.250
We need butter too.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.430
- Are you coming with us tomorrow?
- Where?

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.970
It's Sunday.

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:31.890
No, I'll keep working.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.640
It sure wouldn't hurt you.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:37.150
I'm going for a walk.

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:39.770
- It'll be dark soon.
- Doesn't matter.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.160
He thinks it's normal
to go for a walk in the dark.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.870
Now they are investigating
the use of firearms,

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:32.620
checking whether it was justified.

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.160
Of course it was!

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:37.120
And they filed a complaint.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:39.500
Against you?

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:41.290
Who did?

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.500
District police office.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:44.880
For what?

01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:47.010
Manslaughter.

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.890
The nerve of them!

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:54.010
You risk your life
and they file a complaint!

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.640
Your own people.

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:57.640
That's the system.

01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:58.810
A fine system!

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.810
Do they know who they were?

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.770
Still no leads.

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:05.230
Foreigners. Russians or Poles.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.740
Maybe illegal aliens.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.200
She might have been a prostitute.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.240
Good riddance!

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:18.410
He doesn't show it, but it's a huge strain.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.920
No wonder, she's dead.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.670
It's awful.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.090
He thinks about it constantly.
I'll be right back.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.930
Don't let him get to you.
He has no idea.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.180
What?

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:40.350
Your dad doesn't see how hard this is.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.100
Yeah, you know how he is.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:46.780
I'm just cooling some beer.
We're almost out of mineral water too.

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.280
Besides, it's not that bad.

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:52.280
So she's dead.
What was I supposed to do?

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.780
It was just bad luck.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:56.290
There's nothing you can do.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.370
You know him. Just let him talk.

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:10.970
- I'll get dessert.
- Fine.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.310
You know who I ran into?
Sylvia Staudacher.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.940
She has twins. Girls.

01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:27.820
They are so cute.

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:29.650
Yes, they're adorable.

01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:31.820
What about you?

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:37.490
What could be better
for the two of you right now?

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.950
- It wasn't meant to be.
- House is done.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.290
You're over 30, the perfect age.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.920
Yes, Mama, we're trying,
but you can't force it.

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:47.250
It would get Robert's mind off-

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.760
Yes, I know. We want kids.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.970
It's highly unlikely,
if you want to know the truth.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.180
Why? You were just pregnant.

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.980
Incredible luck, apparently.

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:11.150
A fluke.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.530
I can't believe that.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.610
Did you get tested?

01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:18.530
And what's the problem?

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.490
It's not me.

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.500
Then what, Robert?

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.880
Now that I really can't believe!
He's so athletic.

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:18.390
Hi.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:22.260
That's quite a pile.

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:24.930
You'll need a month for that I reckon.

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.850
- A week.
- Really, just a week?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.440
I get tired just looking at that pile.

01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:32.730
Where is Hausner?

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.030
Isn't he inside?

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.740
I didn't check.

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.700
Bet he's glad someone's helping him.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.280
I feel sorry for him alone on the farm.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.750
Here he is.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.250
You're here already.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.210
Then let's go.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.380
He's not coming,
born and bred a heathen.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.710
Be glad he's doing your work for you.

01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:53.860
I don't know if I can still play.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.280
No fair. You have to play now.
You promised.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:03.620
It's been so long.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.450
Some things you never forget.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.710
Hausner is going to play for us.

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:43.740
He really played up a storm.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:48.580
Hasn't been that happy for ages.
He's like a new man.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.660
I think he enjoys
having someone on the farm.

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.670
Are you staying a while?

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:57.090
No, just long enough to finish the firewood.

01:08:59.170 --> 01:09:00.380
I guess I'll be going.

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.510
Have fun. Fun...

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:05.760
Good luck.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.430
Your husband doesn't go to church?

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.930
He doesn't hold much stock in it.
He'd rather run his route.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:13.189
His route?

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:16.020
To the pond and back.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.270
Every day.

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:03.150
Hi.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.500
I'm playing again.

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.800
Do you miss her?

01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:53.260
The work alone!

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.260
It's depressing all right.

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:09.440
But I'll see her again.

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:11.410
It won't be long now.

01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:14.120
You'll see her again?

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.950
She's waiting.

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:00.720
Why didn't you call?

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.680
Call? Why should I?

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.850
It's past 1:00 a.m.
I didn't know where you were.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.900
Well, nothing happened.

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.480
I still get worried.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.490
I was with the other officers.

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:15.740
We were talking. I lost track of time.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.740
- About what?
- I'm sorry.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.410
Talking about what?

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:30.340
What did you talk about?

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:34.170
Nothing special.
About work and what happened.

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:39.090
You talk to the other men, why not to me?

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:45.270
You don't understand anyway.

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:48.690
Maybe if you talked to me I would.

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:57.780
Besides, the men know it was an accident.
Bad luck.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:00.450
And I don't know that?

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:04.830
Then why do you look at me that way?

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.870
What? How do I look at you?

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.750
You think I can't tell what you're thinking?

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:11.920
You think I can't tell?

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.760
What am I thinking?

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:20.800
That I shot her.

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:24.600
I can tell you think it's my fault.

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:26.680
What?

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.480
You want to talk?
Want me to justify myself?

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:33.650
Even though you don't believe me.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.130
You weren't really serious in there, were you?

01:15:56.670 --> 01:15:58.340
You're right. Forget it.

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:01.010
You don't really believe that's what I think.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.470
You're right.

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:06.140
Are you coming to bed?

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:09.350
I'm just going to finish my beer.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.080
The apples are just about ripe too.

01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:32.100
Here,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.560
taste this.

01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:40.690
Well? Like it?

01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:43.780
Yeah, not bad.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.120
The best winter apples far and wide.

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:56.660
Who are you playing for?

01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:00.080
When Hausner gets started,
there's no stopping him.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.420
She brought us a cake.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.460
Did you scare me!

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.470
Hausner wouldn't let me go.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.060
It's great he's playing again.
It's what he loves most.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.850
What do you want from us?

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.850
What do you mean? Nothing.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.270
Why do you come here?
What do you want?

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.070
I figure it makes him happy.

01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:09.400
I feel sorry for him on the farm all alone.

01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:11.490
He's not alone anymore.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.490
You act like we know each other.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:20.290
Do we know each other?

01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:21.830
No.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.330
We don't know each other.
And it's better that way.

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:27.920
Well, aren't you uncouth!

01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:29.920
You're turning things upside down.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.630
I want you to leave us alone.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:35.510
Cake, music, dance,
tra-la-la, I don't want it.

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:38.810
I don't want you coming back.

01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.520
Do you think that's possible?

01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:47.940
Then come to my house.

01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:50.860
I'll be alone tonight.

01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:54.490
If you want.

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:02.450
Wait till it's dark,
come around the back so no one sees you.

01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:06.080
If you want.

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.290
You didn't chicken out.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.460
Come in.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.140
I wouldn't be surprised
if you were surprised at me.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.890
I'm surprised at myself.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.310
Glass of wine?

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.690
White or red? I've got both.

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:51.730
Whatever.

01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:54.070
I prefer white. Red makes you sleepy.

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:55.730
White perks you up.

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.150
White's okay.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.320
Be right back. New bottle.

01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:03.160
It wasn't full, though.
Not that you think-

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:06.790
Sit. Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right back.

01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:56.540
Well, I hope you like it.

01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:59.880
I think it's quite good.
It's our house wine.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.760
Well then, cheers!

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:06.300
Have a seat.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.220
Nice house.

01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:12.480
Thanks. It turned out nice.

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:16.270
Do cops earn this much?

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.610
No, I've got the store, double income.

01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:21.740
We did a lot ourselves -
Robert and his friends, that is.

01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:24.860
And we got money from our parents
and the bank.

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:27.910
It owns half the house, the upstairs floor.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.910
But that's okay.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.660
It's just for a few years.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.670
Everything neat. Clean.

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:35.880
Tip-top.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.840
Yeah, you know, you want it to be cozy.

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.420
Have a seat.

01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:42.260
Nice house.

01:25:43.050 --> 01:25:44.380
Good husband.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:48.760
Everything perfect.
Exactly as it should be.

01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:52.850
- You must be happy.
- Yes, I guess.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.100
Sure, I can't complain.

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:59.110
So why do you want to fuck me?

01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:11.700
I guess it was a stupid idea.

01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:14.210
I didn't really think that far, sorry.

01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.130
- Wait.
- For what?

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.380
- Can I take a shower?
- Upstairs on the right.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.340
Another glass of wine?

01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:27.670
Yeah.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.010
How cozy!

01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.770
Why are you doing this?

01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:40.770
Are you bored with your cop already?

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:42.560
No, he's my husband.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.770
I just wanted to.

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.820
What does your God have to say?

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.400
He understands.

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:52.110
A very understanding God.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.450
What is it?

01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:56.450
Can't you just be friendly?

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:59.450
Will you lose face
acting like a normal person?

01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:01.620
What happened to you?

01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:06.340
Do you have kids?

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.210
No.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:09.880
But you have a nursery upstairs.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:11.550
But we don't have any.

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.800
I'll be going.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.610
Why are you this way?
What did anyone do to you?

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.780
Be glad you don't know everything.

01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:37.320
Will you come again?

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.750
You sure can work.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.710
Got to give you credit for that.

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:17.880
You should get married.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:25.100
A man needs a woman or he gets batty.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.100
You'll find one easily the way you work.

01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:35.070
You think chopping wood impresses women?

01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:41.870
They notice a man who can work.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.990
Won't be any different nowadays.

01:32:21.450 --> 01:32:23.120
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.340
What's wrong?

01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:21.380
Just dizzy.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.660
Does this happen often?

01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.080
Yeah, sometimes.

01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:59.170
Can you hand me the bag balm?

01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:03.880
It works wonders for headaches.

01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:05.630
You have headaches too?

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.760
All the time.

01:34:08.050 --> 01:34:10.220
You should go in for a checkup.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.770
Doctors don't know anything either.

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.600
But it can't hurt.

01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:19.690
I don't need a doctor for a little headache.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:23.610
You're a stubborn old fool.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.030
You're a stubborn fool yourself.

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:32.120
Who will look after the cows and the farm?

01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:34.120
I'm not leaving.

01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:36.960
They can carry me out in the end.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:38.710
It won't be my problem anymore.

01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:40.790
But until then, I'm not budging.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:46.930
Till the end.

01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:55.930
Alone today?

01:34:56.730 --> 01:34:58.150
How's Hausner?

01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.230
He's okay.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.110
Tell him I said hi.

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:02.980
I'll be alone again tonight.

01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:49.360
Hey, Robert, come on!
Let's drink to my son.

01:35:49.530 --> 01:35:51.200
Give him a glass, would you?

01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:52.700
- Congratulations.
- Thanks!

01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:55.990
20.5 inches, 6.8 pounds, black hair.

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.960
- Here, have a drink.
- I'm on duty.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.210
Stop taking everything so seriously.

01:36:03.210 --> 01:36:05.500
Pass me my glass. Thanks.

01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:07.710
He came at 3:00 yesterday. Took forever.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.380
- You were there the whole time?
- Of course.

01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.040
You're always scaring me.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.040
Come in. What if someone sees you?

01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:30.130
I was sure you weren't coming.

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.090
Good thing I didn't bet anything.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.800
Have you always been a lone wolf,
coming and going?

01:37:36.970 --> 01:37:39.350
Sorry, but that's my impression of you.

01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:40.970
No. Not always.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.230
Will you go back to Vienna
when you're done?

01:37:49.650 --> 01:37:52.440
You have a girlfriend?
I know nothing about you.

01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:55.820
I had one until recently.

01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:57.910
It's over?

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:00.990
What happened?

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.120
She was murdered.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
What?

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.500
She was murdered.

01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:14.420
- Oh my goodness.
- And the man who did it...

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:17.300
lives on.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:20.560
Just like always.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.350
He couldn't care less.

01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.600
- That can't be true.
- But it is.

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.520
He goes on living his life.

01:38:29.150 --> 01:38:30.520
And she is dead.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.740
And all I ever think about
is that I have to change that.

01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:41.290
He can't simply go on living.

01:38:51.710 --> 01:38:55.010
You wanted to know what's wrong.
Now you know.

01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:03.220
You can't do that.
You mustn't even think it.

01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:04.270
What?

01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:06.520
Killing someone out of vengeance.

01:39:08.230 --> 01:39:10.690
I know you don't believe, but it's a sin.

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.320
You mustn't do it.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.820
Now I understand you.

01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:31.040
That's why you're so cold.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.210
So brutal.

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.260
Cold?

01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:40.760
You mustn't do it.

01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:42.680
Promise me.

01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:46.270
Now I understand you.

01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:03.870
Come on.

01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:41.660
You have to go. Robert came home.

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.530
Find your way out.
Don't let him see you.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.410
Maybe he'd like to meet me.

01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:49.450
Please don't. Please go.
Don't ruin everything.

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.460
Please go.

01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:57.500
Why are you home already?

01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:59.130
What's wrong?

01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:05.430
Robert, what happened?

01:41:06.010 --> 01:41:07.850
They gave me a leave of absence.

01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:10.350
Leave of absence?

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.190
I'm unfit for duty.

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.940
The counselor said it's perfectly normal.

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:22.030
It's a normal reaction to the events.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:23.610
Sure it is.

01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:27.990
And he said I might need psychological help.

01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:32.540
I'm not sick. It's normal.
It's how anyone would react.

01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:34.210
That's absolutely right.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:40.960
- I aimed at the tires.
- Everyone knows you did.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.720
I normally hit my mark.
I don't know how this could happen.

01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:47.050
It was just bad luck.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.890
Bad luck.

01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:55.020
Why am I plagued with bad luck?

01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.860
Why can't I do anything right?

01:42:08.410 --> 01:42:11.240
I think a psychologist is a good idea.

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:14.370
And I can't stop looking at the damn photo.

01:42:18.170 --> 01:42:20.920
I don't understand. It couldn't have been me.

01:42:21.090 --> 01:42:22.380
What photo?

01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:25.930
Of the woman.

01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:28.600
You have a photo of her?

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.350
Where did you get this?

01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.450
I aimed at the tires.

01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:47.320
You shouldn't have this.

01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:49.070
Shouldn't be looking at it.

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:53.450
I'm going to throw it away now. Okay?

01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:58.290
I'm throwing the photo away.

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:06.500
What's wrong?

01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:11.550
I'm okay now.

01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:15.430
You belong in bed.

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:19.600
Yeah, maybe.

01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:37.120
I'll be fine tomorrow.

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:39.870
You need a checkup.

01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:41.330
At a hospital.

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:45.790
Things will fall apart if I'm not here.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.550
Everything will go to ruin.

01:45:48.630 --> 01:45:50.260
Nothing will go to ruin.

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:52.920
I'll stay here.

01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:55.140
I'll keep an eye on everything.

01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:58.890
You'll stay here?

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:07.150
I'm not going to any hospital.

01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:10.230
They never let you out again,

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:12.820
and then they put you in a home.

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:15.660
I'm staying on the farm.

01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:19.780
They can carry me out.

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:23.160
You're not dying yet.

01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:25.710
Rest a little.

01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:27.080
We'll go in a bit.

01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:29.000
I'll feed the cows in the meantime.

01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:57.220
Hello.

01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:58.420
Hi.

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:11.770
- You're Hausner's grandson, right?
- Yeah.

01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:14.020
And?

01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.480
How do you like it here?

01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:21.610
Not too exciting, is it?

01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:24.830
Pretty dead compared to the city.

01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:26.870
No, it's fine.

01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:33.540
Nice spot here.

01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:49.770
Aren't you the cop who shot that woman?

01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:54.690
How do you know that?

01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:56.480
People talk.

01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.780
And it was in the paper too.

01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:02.570
Yes.

01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:05.490
That's me.

01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:09.790
Must be a heavy experience.

01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.420
Wouldn't want to go through it again.

01:49:21.010 --> 01:49:24.180
You aimed at him, the bank robber,

01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:26.100
I guess. Am I right?

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.180
I aimed at the tires.

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:36.610
Wanted to.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.190
Yeah, but I don't understand.
They're much lower.

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.320
You must have aimed higher
for that to happen.

01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:46.820
It all went so fast.

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:52.330
I don't understand it myself.

01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:04.880
- Aren't you scared of him?
- Scared?

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.050
Why?

01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.810
You killed his girl.

01:50:11.730 --> 01:50:15.020
What if he tracked you down
and wanted to shoot you?

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:17.980
Out of vengeance.

01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:33.250
Let him.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:47.090
But there's one thing I'd ask him.

01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:48.180
What?

01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:51.600
Why he took her along in the first place.

01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:54.850
She wasn't driving,
wasn't helping him escape.

01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:57.600
He went into the bank alone.
It doesn't make sense.

01:50:57.770 --> 01:51:00.110
Why did he take her as if it were an outing?

01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:03.480
The whole mess happened
because she was there for no reason.

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.240
That's what I'd ask him.

01:51:17.250 --> 01:51:18.370
Bye.

01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:17.100
Dinner is ready.

01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:28.360
What's all this?
Are we celebrating something?

01:52:28.530 --> 01:52:30.030
Yes, maybe.

01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:32.530
I have to tell you something.

01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:36.540
It's still too early, and I'm not positive,

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:39.000
but I have the feeling...

01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:41.620
I think it finally worked.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:43.580
What?

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:45.550
Guess.

01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:51.930
What, you really think so?

01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:57.220
That you're pregnant?

01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:58.600
Yes.

01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:37.430
Hello?

01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:40.600
Anyone here?

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.690
Ah, someone's here after all.

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.450
Where is Hausner? It's Sunday.

01:53:53.610 --> 01:53:54.780
Hospital.

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:58.620
- What's wrong with him?
- We don't know. Tests.

01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:00.370
Poor man.

01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:03.750
You're staying till they know?

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:05.080
Someone has to.

01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:10.300
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah?

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:14.630
Come in.

01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:21.140
Let's hear it.

01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:28.650
You ran into Robert at the pond.

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:34.150
Please never tell him what we did.

01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:36.570
- Why should I?
- Promise me.

01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:37.740
Swear it.

01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:40.990
I swear.

01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:51.590
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:57.090
It was great and electrifying,

01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:59.510
but we shouldn't do it anymore.

01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:13.110
I mean, if we meet by chance,
perfectly normal.

01:55:13.690 --> 01:55:15.400
But I think it's better this way.

01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:20.030
Who's that?

01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:23.490
The girl I told you about.

01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:44.890
Were you there when -

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.310
when she died?

01:56:00.490 --> 01:56:01.740
That was you?

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:06.040
What?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.910
You robbed the bank?

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.920
What will you do now?

01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.380
Stay here if they don't catch me.

01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:04.300
As long as he's still around.

01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:10.640
I have to go now.

01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:26.330
Please don't tell him what happened.

01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:29.910
Don't worry.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.510
I have to go now.
