WEBVTT

00:04.920 --> 00:06.000
Don't shoot.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.200
It's two shots, we'll splice them
together.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.440
We're done, son. You've made all
of us look dirty,

00:10.480 --> 00:14.040
right at the moment we need more
than ever to be immaculate.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.680
Zhang Lin.
Oh, man. I missed you.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.640
- You the famous photograph?
- No, I took one pretty famous photo.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.800
- Do you know what happened to him?
- No, I wish.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.160
In news, you don't have anything
except your credibility

00:25.200 --> 00:26.800
and you don't have that anymore.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.680
You know this isn't just about
the Tank Man.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.880
Zhang Lin, he lost his wife.
She was shot in the street

00:30.920 --> 00:32.159
and nobody remembered.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.656
Look, I'm sorry you lost your job,
but don't take it out on me.

00:34.680 --> 00:38.680
If I get a photo of the Tank Man
alive and well...

00:38.720 --> 00:40.240
This is extracurricular, OK?

00:40.280 --> 00:43.760
Tank Man, Tank Man. What did he do?
He stood in the road.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.840
Do you have his name?
Wang Pengfei.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.560
He painted a perfect copy of
van Gogh's Sunflowers.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.520
As the peaceful protest

00:53.560 --> 00:55.040
in Tiananmen Square continues,

00:55.080 --> 00:57.720
the hunger strikers are hoping
for nothing less

00:57.760 --> 01:00.440
than a democratic revolution.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

01:28.400 --> 01:30.440
Excuse me, do you speak English?

01:32.920 --> 01:36.000
Er, I do, but my wife doesn't.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.000
Are you hunger striking?

02:18.280 --> 02:21.040
That was great. That was really...

02:21.080 --> 02:23.120
Can we check that for sound?
Liuli!

02:23.160 --> 02:24.600
Liuli!

03:36.280 --> 03:39.200
We've got the immigration
searches back.

03:39.240 --> 03:44.560
Nothing for a Wang Pengfei.
Right age, any time, '89 to '95.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.080
If he came into the country,
he didn't do it legally.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.160
Well, I talked to the Beijing Art School,

03:49.200 --> 03:51.640
- guess when they have him on file till.
- December, '89.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.120
That's right. Then he just
disappears.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.680
Hey, by the way, what happened with
Margaret Thatcher?

04:01.400 --> 04:04.880
- Oh, nothing. I just thought it was a...
- Vile mistake?

04:04.920 --> 04:06.440
Yeah.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.080
I hope you used a condom!

04:09.120 --> 04:12.560
You know you can't
photoshop one in later.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.840
That's going to get old real quick.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.920
I don't think so!

04:17.959 --> 04:20.600
Here.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.200
Here we go.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.880
I don't want to take up too much of
your time. We're reporters

04:24.920 --> 04:28.160
and we're trying to track down a man
called Wang Pengfei.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.400
Probably came over from China
around 1989.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.960
Sorry, that's before my time.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.680
You should ask around, someone might
know him.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.360
Do you speak Mandarin?
- No. - Cantonese? - Nah-uh.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.320
Oh, well. Good luck.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.960
I know a Wang Chung.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.480
Wang Kao.

04:52.840 --> 04:58.000
They came in... Oh, I don't know...

04:58.040 --> 04:59.920
2006.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.720
Do you know who this man is?

05:13.280 --> 05:15.240
- Hey, excuse me. Do you speak English?
- Yes.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.280
Can I show you a picture? Do you
know who that is? Tank Man?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.600
Hey. Zhang Lin, how you doing?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.960
Hey, my brother said you
haven't called Benny yet.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.080
You remember? My nephew,
he moved to New York.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.680
Oh, shit.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.080
I'm so sorry, man. I'll do it today.
I've been kind of busy.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.760
- We're looking for him.
- Who?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.440
Wang Pengfei.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.720
What are you going to do when you
find him, Lee?

06:32.760 --> 06:35.800
Put him on the cover of Time
magazine? Person of the Year.

06:35.840 --> 06:37.920
30 years ago, you and Liuli sat
in that square

06:37.960 --> 06:39.960
with 1,000 other people and it's
been forgotten.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.480
It's completely erased from
the history books.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.320
You don't want people
to remember it?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.480
You don't want people
to remember her?

06:49.720 --> 06:51.360
Just call Benny.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.600
So, Benny. You're at Harvard?

06:58.640 --> 07:02.120
I graduated last summer. I work for
the Koch Brothers now.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.360
You heard of them?
Uh-huh.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.080
Yeah, I know they're like the devil,
but they helped me get a Green Card.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.920
It's just data analysis.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.160
So, how do you know Zhang Lin?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.240
I spent some time in Beijing.

07:14.280 --> 07:18.200
After Tiananmen I was trying to
track down the Tank Man.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.840
Oh, right. The dude with the...
with the bags, right?

07:20.880 --> 07:23.560
Yeah, the dude with the bags.
Yeah, that was crazy.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.320
But you know there was, like, a
whole protest before that, right?

07:26.360 --> 07:30.560
Yeah. Yeah, I was there. I saw
the hunger strike, all of it.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.440
What? They weren't hunger striking.
There were people fainting.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.360
I have pictures.
Sure you do. That was the point.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.040
Kids fainting, it's a better story.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.000
But people were coming home,
having dinner, coming back,

07:45.040 --> 07:48.560
sneaking in food. Come on, you think
Nixon invented fake news?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.720
We're the fucking masters
of that shit, man.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.360
- Let me get this.
- No, no.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.160
You enjoy your greenbacks while
you can, dude.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.320
All going to be Yuan soon.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.440
We're coming for you, bitches!

08:04.760 --> 08:08.240
It's a joke. Satire.

08:08.280 --> 08:12.160
- I'm in this improv group...
- Actually, can I ask you a favour?

08:12.200 --> 08:15.320
- It's about Tiananmen.
- Sure.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.040
My phone's being weird.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.360
I think someone's turning on
my microphone.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.800
You think you're that interesting,
do you?

09:37.200 --> 09:39.880
They won't bother you if you don't
do anything wrong.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.080
- I really appreciate this.
- No worries, man.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.880
Is it always this... empty in here?

10:14.920 --> 10:17.200
Yeah.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.760
- We're doing some cost-cutting.
- Right.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.360
Hannah, hey. This is my
friend Benny. Benny, this is Hannah.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.240
She's going to show you how
the archive works.

10:25.241 --> 10:27.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.280
Let's get this keyboard setup here,

10:30.320 --> 10:32.880
with the Chinese characters on it.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.360
Ad revenues are down 8%.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.800
Steve told me he heard their meeting
with Murdoch.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.920
OK. So, the name is Wang Pengfei.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.120
But we're also looking for
references to the Unknown Hero,

10:57.160 --> 11:00.520
- Tank Man, June 4th, maybe.
- Right.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.120
We've already done a search through
the Western media,

11:03.160 --> 11:05.280
but we need to do the same for
the Chinese press

11:05.320 --> 11:08.600
and my Mandarin is kind of basic,
so...

11:08.640 --> 11:10.600
Do you mind? I'll pay you.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.680
No, man. Happy to help.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.320
OK, let's get you logged in.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.800
Thanks.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.680
Shit. Lee, come see this.

11:40.800 --> 11:46.720
So that says, "In memory of
the mothers who lost on 6/4."

11:46.760 --> 11:51.200
- 6/4 is June 4th.
- That was Tiananmen. So?

11:51.240 --> 11:54.800
So, that's insane. This is
the China Weekly Herald.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.600
There's no way that that should have
gotten through the sensors.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.960
Wait, this is better.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.720
Hang on a sec. Mel!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.160
What does it say?

12:08.200 --> 12:13.840
"A message to Wang Pengfei,
the unknown hero of the Square."

12:13.880 --> 12:15.680
"We remember."

12:15.720 --> 12:17.760
Frank's going to want more
than that.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.640
My dad has friends at that
newspaper.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.360
We've got to find out who placed
that ad.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.400
We will build a great
wall along the southern border...

12:38.840 --> 12:41.240
Hey, girl. Did you see it?

12:41.280 --> 12:44.440
Did you love it? I want to get it.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.600
Anyone who has entered
the United States illegally

12:50.640 --> 12:53.440
is subject to deportation.

12:53.480 --> 12:58.200
That is what it means to have walls
and to have a country.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.360
Fucking arsehole!
Look where you're going!

13:35.400 --> 13:37.320
Dude, are you OK?

13:37.360 --> 13:40.160
- You want me to call the cops on
that guy? - No. No, no.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.440
No police. No police.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
So, what have you got?

16:17.401 --> 16:19.690
In June of last year, a woman makes

16:19.700 --> 16:22.940
a long-distance call to China from
Manhattan. Places two personal ads

16:22.980 --> 16:27.020
in the China Weekly Herald.
"Mothers who lost on 6/4."

16:27.060 --> 16:30.380
The girl on the desk takes the copy,
the woman pays by credit card.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.340
A middle-aged Chinese guy yells,
"Go to print."

16:35.380 --> 16:37.660
Wait. She didn't censor it?

16:37.700 --> 16:39.940
No, the girl wasn't even born when
Tiananmen happened.

16:39.980 --> 16:42.260
It's been completely erased from
the history books.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.380
So when some lady calls with a bunch
of messages

16:44.420 --> 16:48.020
about one of the worst atrocities
in her country's history,

16:48.060 --> 16:50.940
the girl doesn't think anything
but how long until lunch?

16:50.980 --> 16:52.660
- Didn't the party pick it up?
- Sure.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.980
The editor gets fired,
the girl gets fired,

16:55.020 --> 16:57.700
can't get a reference, doesn't even
know what she's done wrong.

16:57.740 --> 17:01.020
So, when a friend of a friend says
I can get you to New York...

17:01.060 --> 17:04.940
Well, great. But she has no
qualifications, no work permit,

17:04.980 --> 17:06.619
ends up in the garment district

17:06.660 --> 17:11.180
sleeping in the dressing room
of a fucking strip club.

17:11.220 --> 17:13.940
So, what are you waiting for?

17:13.980 --> 17:17.140
Lee. You can't keep coming back
to the office.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.940
- If Lou sees you...
- She won't see me.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.780
I know she won't,
because you won't be there.

17:21.819 --> 17:24.420
Are we copacetic?

17:49.060 --> 17:52.820
I only have like five minutes, they
don't like guests back here.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.740
We only want a minute of your time.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.940
You work for a newspaper?

17:57.980 --> 18:00.860
- Yeah.
- So I can get a job?

18:00.900 --> 18:03.220
Because I used to work for a Chinese
newspaper, you know?

18:03.260 --> 18:06.420
Yeah, we're sorry to hear about
what happened there.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.540
Mary?

18:08.580 --> 18:10.780
Jessie? Two minutes.

18:12.060 --> 18:14.700
Listen, Mary. We know this is kind
of a long shot,

18:14.740 --> 18:17.300
but you don't happen to remember
the name of the woman

18:17.340 --> 18:18.980
who placed the advertisement,
do you?

18:19.020 --> 18:22.740
That's the woman who ruined my life.
Yeah, I remember.

18:22.780 --> 18:26.580
Feng Meihui. I have my notebooks,
though. We can check.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.660
Feng Meihui?
Do you think that's her real name?

18:29.700 --> 18:32.460
Unless she used a fake credit card.

18:32.500 --> 18:36.500
You look for her, yeah? You find
her, tell her thanks for nothing.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.300
Mary Chang says fuck you.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.780
This is a one time thing, OK?

18:51.540 --> 18:56.180
OK. So, we have three Feng Meihuis
on record in Manhattan.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.500
One, she died last year.

18:58.540 --> 19:01.540
Second's in Penn state.
Nice lady...

19:01.580 --> 19:05.220
attacked a real estate agent
with a fire iron.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.660
Last one lives in Chinatown
on Mott Street.

19:08.700 --> 19:13.700
Clean record, except for a speeding
ticket up in Maine, 2002.

19:13.740 --> 19:17.540
It's a fish stall.
Feng's Seafood Market.

19:17.580 --> 19:21.740
But listen, if I get a report of a
Chinese businesswoman being harassed

19:21.780 --> 19:26.460
by a prick with a camera, I will
find you and throw away the key.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.060
Remind me why we broke up!

19:28.100 --> 19:30.620
Because you were cheating on me
with Chechnya.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.820
- No photo!
- Sorry.

19:40.860 --> 19:43.780
You got the money?
- Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

19:47.380 --> 19:49.140
Here you go.

19:50.700 --> 19:54.340
So, we wanted to speak with you
about two ads that you placed

19:54.380 --> 19:56.780
with the China Weekly Herald,
last year.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.340
The first one, "Mothers of 6/4."

19:59.380 --> 20:04.500
I'm sorry to ask this, but did you
lose someone? In Tiananmen?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.860
Twins.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.540
Very small.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.580
Babies.

20:15.620 --> 20:19.060
The apartment, bullet come through
the window

20:19.100 --> 20:21.300
into the kitchen, into the crib.

20:23.620 --> 20:27.780
When I have twins, I think I am so
lucky, right?

20:27.820 --> 20:30.540
I beat the one-child policy.

20:30.580 --> 20:33.780
Yeah, they get you in the end.

20:36.020 --> 20:39.540
The second ad, "The unknown hero."

20:39.580 --> 20:41.500
I don't know nothing about that.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.940
I do it for someone else, he don't
have a credit card.

20:43.980 --> 20:45.620
Could you tell us his name?

20:50.900 --> 20:52.380
Oh.

20:52.420 --> 20:54.220
Er... Hey, maybe, erm...

20:56.540 --> 20:58.340
Could this help?

21:00.780 --> 21:03.940
He call himself Jimmy Wang.
And don't hassle him, OK?

21:03.980 --> 21:07.220
Is it possible that his Chinese name
might be Wang Pengfei?

21:07.260 --> 21:08.780
I don't know.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.380
Do you know who that person is?

21:12.420 --> 21:14.980
Yeah. He's famous.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.660
Did you bring him to New York?

21:17.700 --> 21:20.380
- No.
- OK, but the ad that you placed

21:20.420 --> 21:22.940
for Jimmy Wang, was that a favour?

21:22.980 --> 21:25.700
Like guanxi.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.740
Not guanxi. Just money.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.340
So, how do you know him?

21:36.620 --> 21:40.540
- I help him come into the country.
- And when was this?

21:40.580 --> 21:43.380
October, 1989.

21:43.420 --> 21:47.540
- Where is he now? - He worked
restaurant, then some flower shop.

21:47.580 --> 21:49.020
Which flower shop?

21:49.060 --> 21:51.340
Glorious City, Flushing.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.180
Thank you, thank you.

21:56.220 --> 21:58.220
Here...

22:05.420 --> 22:07.980
...pollock. Similar to cod.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.260
Xie xie.

24:22.740 --> 24:24.980
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

24:25.020 --> 24:26.460
Hi.

24:28.580 --> 24:30.220
Oh, what a beautiful shop.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.660
What are those? Are they dahlias?

24:34.700 --> 24:37.420
- Chrysanthemums.
- Oh, my mum loved those.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.980
I never can remember the name.

24:40.020 --> 24:45.420
I'm Mel Kincaid, I'm a reporter,
and this is Lee Berger.

24:45.460 --> 24:48.500
I don't know if you can help us out.
We're looking for someone

24:48.540 --> 24:51.820
called Jimmy Wang or Wang Pengfei.

24:51.860 --> 24:55.380
- Sorry.
- No one by that name working here?

24:55.420 --> 24:57.740
Maybe worked here sometime
in the past?

24:57.780 --> 24:59.420
No. I can't help you.

24:59.460 --> 25:02.260
They're apartments upstairs, right?
I saw the AC units outside.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.140
No, he doesn't live there.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.540
We're not cops.
He knows that, Lee.

25:09.580 --> 25:11.620
OK, well thank you so much
for your time.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.540
I'm just going to leave my card
here, OK?

25:13.580 --> 25:16.460
And if you think of anything, you
can just call that number.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.500
Can I just show you something here?
I promise, we're not cops.

25:19.540 --> 25:22.340
Have you ever seen this photo
before? Do you know who that man is?

25:25.660 --> 25:28.220
Erm...

25:28.260 --> 25:30.220
I don't know this man.

25:30.260 --> 25:33.620
- Excuse me.
- OK, well thanks so much for your time.

25:43.860 --> 25:45.660
Lee, come on.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.260
You want to buy something?

25:54.700 --> 25:57.380
Oh, yeah, yeah. OK.

25:57.420 --> 26:01.860
Erm, sure. I'll take some of those
sunflowers, thank you.

26:28.260 --> 26:30.220
- Hey, Zhang Lin.
- What's wrong with you?

26:30.260 --> 26:31.980
You don't put those words in
an email to me.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.620
Wait, wait. What are you talking
about?

26:33.660 --> 26:36.220
Do you think an email like that from
an American journalist

26:36.260 --> 26:37.620
gets past the censors?

26:37.660 --> 26:40.460
Oh, shit. I'm such a fucking moron.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.300
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

26:42.340 --> 26:43.940
No.

26:45.140 --> 26:47.060
- I kissed Joy.
- What, who?

26:47.100 --> 26:52.700
What, who, why? Do you ever stop
being a journalist for one minute?

26:52.740 --> 26:55.620
My next door neighbour's daughter.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.620
It was awful, I have to move.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.660
Why, what did she say?

26:59.700 --> 27:02.060
Nothing. I don't know, I ran away.

27:02.100 --> 27:05.140
It's OK. It's been a while, right?

27:05.180 --> 27:07.860
I'm sure it wasn't that bad, just...

27:07.900 --> 27:11.860
...give her call and apologise.

27:11.900 --> 27:15.060
Yeah. OK. Bye.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.540
Hey, Zhang Lin. I'm sorry.

27:16.580 --> 27:19.620
Did you get a chance to look at that
picture that I just sent?

27:19.660 --> 27:21.100
Yeah.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.180
I don't know that guy.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.240
The Glorious City Flower Shop,
owned since '92

28:04.280 --> 28:06.720
by a Mr Lum, lives in Shanghai.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.560
One employee, same the past 20 years
from the looks of things.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.160
I've got the Social Security number,
he's definitely undocumented.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.880
How do you know?

28:15.920 --> 28:19.120
I don't, but he doesn't look like a
100-year-old black woman to me.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.760
Call it female intuition.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.360
So, he's been paying taxes on his
stolen Social Security number

28:28.400 --> 28:31.080
since 1989? That doesn't
make any sense.

28:31.120 --> 28:34.840
It's not unusual. Undocumented
immigrants pay millions in taxes.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.120
They think if they ever get caught
it'll look good for them.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.640
I did a whole series on this, do you
actually ever read any of my work?

28:43.120 --> 28:46.040
This man in Shanghai,
I'm calling him.

28:54.160 --> 28:59.680
Hi, this is Mel Kincaid, I'm a
reporter. Do you speak English, sir?

29:04.080 --> 29:10.560
Oh, great. I have some questions
about your employee Wang Pengfei.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.240
Or Jimmy Wang, he runs your store.

29:14.640 --> 29:18.680
I can't say anything about that,
please do not contact me again.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.440
Don't get excited, it could be
he just doesn't want to have

29:21.480 --> 29:25.560
immigration on his ass.
Your refrigerator is a cry for help.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.240
Oh, I know. It's broken.
It's the coils, or something.

29:31.880 --> 29:35.720
We'll go back to the flower shop
tomorrow and try again.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.040
Do you know who Maria Meng is?

29:52.080 --> 29:53.320
Yeah.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.400
Do you know, she's not Maria Meng
anymore? She married a dentist.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.840
She is Senator Dubecki.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.640
- You know her?
- Why?

30:01.680 --> 30:04.360
Well, she's done a ton of advocacy
work for the Chinese community,

30:04.400 --> 30:06.160
maybe she could help us out?

30:12.560 --> 30:15.640
Our votes don't go straight to
the candidates, you see.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.920
So on election day, we elect
the electors

30:18.960 --> 30:22.040
who then elect the president.
You got it?

30:22.080 --> 30:26.400
And so that's how Electoral Colleges
work. - Thank you, Senator.

30:26.440 --> 30:31.480
You're welcome. This has been my
favourite interview ever.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.320
You guys better watch out, huh!

30:38.840 --> 30:41.200
Thank you, Tyler. That was great.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.920
Thank you so much. We'll see you
next time.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.880
- Excuse me.
- Maria?

30:47.920 --> 30:49.600
Mel! Good to see you.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.200
So, that is a great looking pant
suit, Senator!

30:52.240 --> 30:54.320
You been raiding
Hillary's closet again?

30:54.360 --> 30:56.120
I know, I know. It's awful.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.320
It's just Mondays I let my daughter
pick my outfits.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.360
She's nine, she's got terrible taste!

31:00.400 --> 31:03.280
Where are my manners? This is my
legislative assistant, Dave.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.360
- David. David Barker.
- David.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.360
We just want to say good luck.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.320
Luck? Honey, it'll be over by Ohio!

31:10.360 --> 31:13.320
- Excuse me.
- Oh, wait just one second, before you...

31:13.360 --> 31:16.400
We're working on a story and we're
trying to track down a source.

31:16.440 --> 31:19.120
He's Chinese and we think he might
be undocumented.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.520
Erm, you do realise we're pretty
busy here

31:21.560 --> 31:23.640
trying to get a woman into
the White House, right?

31:23.680 --> 31:26.640
He works at the Glorious City Flower
Store, his name is Wang Pengfei

31:26.680 --> 31:28.920
or Jimmy Wang. Do you know him?

31:30.640 --> 31:33.600
Because we all know each other, right?

31:33.640 --> 31:35.520
You'll have to excuse me, I need
the bathroom.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.400
These pants are cutting me in
half. Nice seeing you guys.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.600
Vote, vote, vote.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.480
You know, I slept in this square
for a month when I was 22,

33:05.520 --> 33:07.760
- right over there.
- You were on the street?

33:07.800 --> 33:09.880
No. God, no. Vietnam.

33:09.920 --> 33:14.200
There were about 500 of us here.
The stink, that's what I remember.

33:14.240 --> 33:17.200
I wore the same pair of jeans
for a straight month.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.480
You protested?

33:19.520 --> 33:22.400
You know, that is not the big
surprise. The big surprise is,

33:22.440 --> 33:24.560
I used to wear jeans!

33:24.600 --> 33:28.600
Sorry. School carpool. Carnage.
Don't ask.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.760
So, what's going on?

33:31.800 --> 33:33.800
I need you to drop the story.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.160
What?

33:37.360 --> 33:39.720
There's some stuff going on
upstairs, it's not a good time.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.680
Is it Murdoch? No, no, no.
The parent company's in trouble,

33:42.720 --> 33:45.320
they're seeking investment capital
and they're seeking it

33:45.360 --> 33:47.720
from the only place in the world
there is any right now.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.080
- China?
- They're not saying kill it,

33:51.120 --> 33:54.520
they're just saying cool it till
the ink is dry.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.640
- Maybe a year.
- A year?!

33:56.680 --> 33:59.680
No, no. You can't do that. We're
onto something here.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.200
And this is censorship.

34:01.240 --> 34:05.280
I don't think you can sum up what
this is in just one word.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.800
So you seriously want to work
for a newspaper

34:08.840 --> 34:11.000
with less transparency than
the People's Daily?

34:11.040 --> 34:13.560
You're a guardian of the free
fucking press!

34:13.600 --> 34:16.560
You think this is vanity, publishing
what I do?

34:16.600 --> 34:19.800
This newspaper's some sort of
catalogue of my favourite things?

34:19.840 --> 34:22.360
Do I look like fucking Oprah?

34:22.400 --> 34:25.920
Don't you dare stand there
and suffer at me.

34:25.960 --> 34:29.000
You think I enjoy using the word
multiplatform?

34:29.040 --> 34:31.840
That I like employing the best
writers in the country,

34:31.880 --> 34:34.719
then sticking a comment section
under their articles

34:34.760 --> 34:38.960
because God forbid an opinion should
go unvoiced?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.040
Arseholes Anonymous.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.040
Validating each other in packs
under my banner.

34:44.080 --> 34:49.679
That's not democracy, that's a
national circle jerk for imbeciles.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.800
It's done.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.080
I'm sorry.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.440
Go on, you can hit me, if it makes
you feel better.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.600
Right there.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.440
You fucking liberals.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.080
Too much spilled coffee and not
enough split lips.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.240
You voted for Bill Clinton!

35:19.280 --> 35:20.960
Prove it!

35:21.000 --> 35:23.880
- I say we go to a different paper.
- And breach my contract?

35:23.920 --> 35:26.656
- I have a kid and a mortgage, Lee.
- Do you think you'll have trouble

35:26.680 --> 35:29.120
getting hired after a story
like this?

35:29.160 --> 35:32.680
That guy in the flower shop, it's
either him or he knows something.

35:32.720 --> 35:36.120
Sure, but maybe Wang Pengfei
doesn't want to be found.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.160
Did you ever think about that?

35:38.200 --> 35:41.400
The guy's illegal, he's been living
in secret for 30 years.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.600
Do you want to be the person who
shows his picture to the Feds?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.080
The IRS, the Party?

35:46.120 --> 35:48.880
So we help him get asylum, he's a
political refugee.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.880
You know, this is censorship,
what you're endorsing.

35:53.920 --> 35:58.200
- Hey, I'm not endorsing anything.
- And for what?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.280
To keep your union contract?

36:00.320 --> 36:02.320
Go on churning out your right on
columns

36:02.360 --> 36:04.120
while the right wing shits all
over you?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.200
The right has always been hostile
to the press.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.280
Oh, well, sure, but now they
fucking loathe us.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.360
And of course they do because
Hillary's out there

36:10.400 --> 36:12.560
calling half the country a basket
of deplorables

36:12.600 --> 36:16.000
and we line up to high-five her
like there's no grey areas here.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.680
You know what, Lee?
You're a grey fucking area.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.840
I need a drink.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.960
You've reached Tessa Kendrick.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.520
Please leave a message and I'll get
back to you.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.600
Hi, this is... This is Lee.

36:53.640 --> 36:57.360
Erm, can you give me a call back
when you get this?

36:57.400 --> 36:59.160
I just wanted to...

37:00.800 --> 37:02.760
I'd like to apologise.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.440
OK.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.880
Bye.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.000
Joy?

38:57.160 --> 38:58.720
Joy?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.440
Joy?

39:03.020 --> 39:05.740
I'm really sorry how I acted
at dinner.

39:05.780 --> 39:09.860
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no, no. I-I-I was awful.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.700
Do you want a beer?
They're not cold.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.180
Nah!

39:14.220 --> 39:16.620
- Oh, sorry. I'm dripping on your floor.
- Oh, dear.

39:16.660 --> 39:18.860
Here, let me deal with that.

39:31.180 --> 39:34.300
Do you do a lot of that then?
Protesting?

39:34.340 --> 39:37.540
Oh, no. Not any more.

39:37.580 --> 39:39.580
Last time I almost got arrested.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.860
So I was thinking about your offer

39:41.900 --> 39:44.820
and I had a look through my
China archive.

39:46.900 --> 39:49.260
You wanted to licence something,
right? For your...

39:49.300 --> 39:52.820
- For the credit card?
- Oh, you changed your mind!

39:54.340 --> 39:57.940
I thought I was like Eva Braun
for even asking you.

39:57.980 --> 40:01.780
Well, yeah. But I've been thinking
maybe I was a little fast to...

40:01.820 --> 40:03.620
you know, because it's a credit card,

40:03.660 --> 40:06.100
it's not Agent Orange or anything
and also...

40:06.140 --> 40:08.900
- You're broke?
- And also I'm broke, yeah.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.220
Actually, we had to move on.
I'm sorry.

40:15.260 --> 40:18.580
Oh. Oh, right.

40:18.620 --> 40:20.420
Of course, obviously.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.660
Was it a lot of money?
No, don't tell me!

40:27.940 --> 40:30.060
Are you sure you don't want
that beer?

40:30.100 --> 40:31.580
All right.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.980
Cheers.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.180
Oh, did you find him yet?

40:41.220 --> 40:43.420
My editor killed the story.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.060
So?

40:45.100 --> 40:47.140
Aren't you fired already?

40:47.180 --> 40:49.140
Yeah.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.660
Hey, do you have any plans today?

41:03.140 --> 41:05.940
Oh. No, no, no.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.420
Where did he go?

41:12.460 --> 41:14.900
Oh, shit! Let's go round the back.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.740
Come with me.

41:24.020 --> 41:25.780
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

41:25.820 --> 41:27.540
Go, go, go, go.

41:41.180 --> 41:42.460
Lee, I don't like this.

41:45.620 --> 41:50.340
OK, on a scale of one to ten,
how illegal is this? - Erm...

41:51.740 --> 41:53.620
9.5.

41:55.860 --> 41:57.820
Come here, come here.
Look over this stuff

41:57.860 --> 42:00.100
and take pictures of anything that
looks interesting.

42:00.140 --> 42:02.780
I'm going to go upstairs, I'll be
right back. - Wait, wait, wait.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.860
I'll be right back.

43:28.460 --> 43:29.900
Lee!

43:37.780 --> 43:39.620
Lee, come on.

43:45.180 --> 43:47.660
That's him, it's the Tank Man.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.060
It's him!

43:51.500 --> 43:53.060
You OK?

44:07.660 --> 44:09.620
- Frank.
- Did you send me a fish?

44:09.660 --> 44:11.940
Yeah, it's pollock. Similar to cod.

44:11.980 --> 44:14.580
Is this about the story?
There's shit all over my desk.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.820
You remember who gave me this desk,
Lee?

44:16.860 --> 44:20.140
- Henry Kissinger.
- Henry fucking Kissinger!

44:37.300 --> 44:38.660
Hello?

44:38.700 --> 44:40.540
Hello, Lee.

44:40.580 --> 44:43.980
I think you and I have been having
the same dream.

44:46.540 --> 44:49.620
- Sorry, who is this?
- My name is Tang Wen Lei,

44:49.660 --> 44:52.660
I'm a very important guy.

44:52.700 --> 44:55.460
My friends tell me you are looking
for the Tank Man.

44:55.500 --> 45:00.340
I think I can help you, but I need
to keep myself safe.

45:00.380 --> 45:03.460
- How do we do this?
- Mr Tang, can I call you right back?

45:03.500 --> 45:06.220
No, Lee. I will call you.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.100
Joy?

45:35.220 --> 45:36.820
Joy?

45:36.860 --> 45:38.220
Joy?

45:38.260 --> 45:39.580
Joy?
