WEBVTT

00:05.630 --> 00:08.964
Let's go for a ride.

00:09.092 --> 00:14.596
My name is George Lass. I'm 18 years old
and I am down there, somewhere.

00:14.723 --> 00:18.056
I'm gonna tell you a story.
Not my story, that's later.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.138
This is just a story. Ready?

00:21.271 --> 00:25.600
Once upon a time,
or more specifically, at the dawn of time,

00:25.734 --> 00:29.648
god, lower-case G,
was "getting busy" with creation,

00:29.779 --> 00:31.487
as kids these days say.

00:31.614 --> 00:37.819
He gave toad a clay jar and said,
"Be careful with this, it's got death inside."

00:37.954 --> 00:43.459
Pleased as punch and unaware that he would
become god's fall guy on the death issue,

00:43.585 --> 00:45.791
toad promised to guard the jar.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.921
But then one day, toad met frog.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.761
"Let me hold the jar of death,
or whatever you call it, Frog-bag."

00:53.887 --> 00:58.134
With a nod to Nancy Reagan's pearl of wisdom,
toad just said no.

00:58.266 --> 01:03.011
But frog was determined,
and after much whining, toad finally gave in.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.182
You can hold it just for a second," he said.

01:06.316 --> 01:12.271
In his excitement, frog began to hop and
juggle the death jar from one foot to the other.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.564
Frog was an asshole.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.784
"Stop!" toad cried, but it was too late.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.995
Frog dropped the jar
and it shattered to the ground.

01:21.706 --> 01:26.949
When it broke open, death got out,
and ever since all living things have to die.

01:27.087 --> 01:31.749
Wonder how much better the world would be
if frogs stuck to hocking beer?

01:31.883 --> 01:36.047
So there you have it,
the mystery of death finally revealed.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.299
We all die, some of us sooner than later.

01:39.432 --> 01:44.937
For me, it's going to be much sooner...
but that's only the beginning of my story.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.442
That's not me.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.426 --> 02:20.713
That's me. I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I'm not. I excel at not giving a shit.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.850
Experience has taught me
that interest begets expectation

02:23.977 --> 02:28.805
and expectation begets disappointment,
so to avoid disappointment, just avoid interest.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.605
A equals B equals C equals A, or whatever.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.354
I'm also not interested
in being a good or a bad person.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.815
Either way, you're screwed.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.575
Bad people are punished by society's law...

02:42.704 --> 02:45.989
Drop your weapon.
Put your hands in the air!

02:47.042 --> 02:48.536
.. and good people...

02:48.668 --> 02:51.918
Who's a pretty kitty? You are!

02:52.047 --> 02:53.838
Come on, sweetheart.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.002
.. are punished by Murphy's Law.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.976
So you see my dilemma.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.688
Georgia Lass?

03:22.452 --> 03:25.821
Hi. I'm Delores Herbig,
as in "her big brown eyes".

03:25.955 --> 03:30.950
I'll be your Happy Time career counsellor.
Why don't you come with me?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.893
"Some college," huh? Didn't finish?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.941
"Some" seemed enough.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.023
You have management experience
in the food service industry.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.621
Big mamito with a cherry Pepsi.

04:09.749 --> 04:10.828
Yeah.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.659
Do you ever wake up
and realise your life is meaningless?

04:16.380 --> 04:20.877
- What?
- Are you familiar with Microsoft Office?

04:21.011 --> 04:24.878
- Word? Access? PowerPoint?
- I know Lotus.

04:25.015 --> 04:31.551
We use Excel now, dear.
You might think about taking some tutorials.

04:32.647 --> 04:37.309
I'll get to the point.
What kind of work are you looking for?

04:38.486 --> 04:44.774
- I don't know. What's available?
- For you, we have clerical positions.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.614
Reception, data entry...

04:47.746 --> 04:51.364
I was told to ask
about being an executive assistant.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.500
Well, you can ask.

04:54.627 --> 04:59.752
To be absolutely honest, with your
rather limited experience and education,

04:59.883 --> 05:02.255
you're better off sticking to redundant duties.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.090
How do you feel about filing?

05:05.221 --> 05:08.388
- I never thought about it.
- Maybe you should.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.515
Can I make an observation?

05:14.647 --> 05:19.060
I haven't seen you smile once
since you set foot in this office

05:19.194 --> 05:23.737
and a sunny disposition is a bonus in any job,
especially at Happy Time.

05:23.865 --> 05:29.286
Trust me, no employer
is gonna want a sad sack on their hands.

05:29.412 --> 05:34.454
- Look at me. I wouldn't have gotten this far...
- How far is that?

05:34.584 --> 05:37.918
- I beg your pardon?
- How far have you gotten?

05:38.046 --> 05:43.289
I mean... it's not like
this is a corner office with a view

05:43.426 --> 05:46.961
and every day, you have to find jobs for people,

05:47.097 --> 05:50.845
most of which are better than yours
and that has to suck.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.179
I bet they don't pay you much either.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.358
Just making an observation.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.863
- How did things go today?
- OK.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.905
- Just OK?
- Yeah. Just OK.

06:11.413 --> 06:16.039
She's bitter 'cause they told her
she wasn't qualified to get a decent job.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.493
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.333
- Wanna know what I think?
- Here we go.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.252
You should never have dropped out of college.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.548
I still don't understand
why you couldn't finish the semester.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.382
What happened to you, Georgia?

06:34.519 --> 06:38.137
You used to have friends and be so smart.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.431
It's like you just gave up.

06:43.903 --> 06:48.530
- Well, I hate to say, "I told you so."
- You love to say it.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.327
Don't talk that way to your mother.

06:51.453 --> 06:55.533
- You know it only aggravates her.
- Thank you, honey, that's helpful!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.741
Meet the family.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.367
Joy, aged 41, is a Virgo.

07:00.503 --> 07:04.881
She's a career secretary and enjoys
ice-skating and John Grisham novels.

07:05.008 --> 07:11.260
She's afraid of balloons and hates the word
"moist". She thinks it's pornographic.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.639
Clancy, aged 43, is a Cancer.

07:14.768 --> 07:19.809
He's a tenured professor of English at UW
and is, I'm told, very well respected.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.477
He's having an affair with a graduate student.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.016
And that's Reggie. She's ten.

07:25.153 --> 07:30.444
She's not really invisible,
but as far as I'm concerned, she may as well be.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.328
This is delicious.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.407
And moist.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.128
When I was little,
Mom told me Santa didn't exist.

07:52.263 --> 07:56.261
Neither did the Easter Bunny,
the Tooth Fairy, or the Great Pumpkin.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.770
Even though she didn't say so,
I assumed God didn't either.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.981
Otherwise I'd probably be praying right now.

08:20.291 --> 08:25.203
I'd pray for world peace etc
and maybe even for a little guidance.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.632
Do you know what it's like, cusping
on adulthood, not knowing who you are,

08:29.759 --> 08:32.879
what you wanna be,
or even if you wanna be?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.013
It's ten shades of suck is what it is!

08:37.475 --> 08:39.634
- Get up!
- Mom.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.433
That woman from the temp agency
has a job for you.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.731
- What kind of job?
- Beggars can't be choosers.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.529
- I don't feel good.
- Too bad.

08:49.654 --> 08:55.241
- I think I have a temperature.
- Dammit, Georgia, you are not six years old!

08:55.368 --> 08:59.318
18 years of coddling is enough for you,
young lady.

08:59.456 --> 09:03.952
If you think you can spend your life
suckling at my retirement fund,

09:04.085 --> 09:06.161
you've got another thing coming.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.709
You will get up and go to work.

09:09.841 --> 09:13.755
You will collect a pay check
and move out of this house.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.298
Understood?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.634
Get dressed.

09:17.766 --> 09:22.143
- Those are funeral clothes.
- There'll be one if you don't move your ass!

09:22.270 --> 09:24.844
The last words
my mother will say to me.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.440
Move it!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.974
Boy, is she gonna be sorry.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.656
Who had the nerve to name you Joy?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.786
See all these boxes?

09:39.913 --> 09:44.207
We acquired a small insurance company
based out of Spokane two years ago.

09:44.334 --> 09:48.497
All their claim files were shipped to us
for electronic data conversion.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.872
This is what we call the Pit.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.957
Get cosy, 'cause you are
gonna spend a lot of time here.

09:55.095 --> 10:01.631
So your mission is to sift through all this crap
and code it for the pencil-necks in Data Entry.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.971
- Think you can handle that?
- Sure, whatever.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.848
Cool.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.025
So what did you do to piss Delores off?

10:11.778 --> 10:16.404
- Huh?
- Delores Herbig, as in "her big brown eyes".

10:19.869 --> 10:24.946
You must've done something.
She only gives this job to people she hates.

10:25.083 --> 10:30.753
As the day progressed, I began to suspect
that Delores Herbig, as in "her big fat ass",

10:30.880 --> 10:33.253
was the devil and she'd condemned me to hell.

10:34.968 --> 10:40.093
To spite the great hoofed one,
I took every opportunity to shirk my duties.

10:47.981 --> 10:54.066
Even though I did my best to do very little,
most everyone else was doing a lot less.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.337
Welcome to corporate America.

11:18.053 --> 11:21.089
Was this it? Was this who I was?

11:21.222 --> 11:26.050
Would I forever be remembered as a file clerk?
Or worse, a temp?

11:48.083 --> 11:49.956
Just toss 'em in there.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.953
Where are the other files?

11:55.090 --> 11:58.874
- What other files?
- The files I requested, the red-flag cases.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.508
Yeah. Looked for those, couldn't find them.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.471
Well, files just don't disappear.

12:07.519 --> 12:11.979
They do if you drop them
down an elevator shaft.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.183
Is that a joke?

12:15.360 --> 12:18.065
I don't know. Yeah, maybe.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.857
Can I go now?

12:22.450 --> 12:24.858
- Which elevator?
- Middle one.

12:31.793 --> 12:36.371
I was doomed to spend
the rest of my life in a dead-end job.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.258
And I'm not just being dramatic.

12:39.384 --> 12:45.007
It really is the rest of my life... which
actually only amounts to the next half hour.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.903
Hey, what's up?

12:59.029 --> 13:02.813
- Nothing.
- Nada mucho, that's cool.

13:02.949 --> 13:07.029
It's your lunch hour.
We'll see you back here in 35.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.538
If it's my lunch hour, why is it 35 minutes?

13:11.666 --> 13:15.995
'Cause they did some research five years ago
and they clocked some folks

13:16.129 --> 13:22.132
and figured that's how long it takes
to go somewhere, get your food and eat it.

13:22.260 --> 13:26.092
So we'll see you in three-five.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.236
It was a beautiful day.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.820
The sun was shining, the sky was blue

13:45.950 --> 13:49.284
and the Russian space agency
was de-orbiting the Earth.

13:51.081 --> 13:55.624
There was a miscalculation in the density
of the ionosphere at the point of entry

13:55.752 --> 13:57.412
or something like that.

13:57.545 --> 14:02.788
It was supposed to fall in the Pacific,
but a few pieces got to the West Coast,

14:02.926 --> 14:05.417
including the seat of a 0-G toilet.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.590
Excuse me? Got the time?

14:09.724 --> 14:13.639
- Five after one.
- Thank you. Thank you very much,.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.226
So what is your name?

14:17.857 --> 14:21.440
- George.
- Uh, middle name?

14:21.569 --> 14:24.025
- You got a middle name?
- Fuck off!

14:24.155 --> 14:26.646
Does it start with an "L"?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.454
You'd better hurry, George.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.492
You're gonna be late.

14:52.976 --> 14:57.389
They say your life flashes
before your eyes the moment before you die.

14:57.522 --> 15:01.816
That might be true if you're terminally ill,
or your parachute doesn't open,

15:01.943 --> 15:08.396
but if death sneaks up on you, the only thing
you have time to think is, "Aw, shit!"

15:51.785 --> 15:53.030
Get outta here!

16:04.381 --> 16:05.661
I'll solve the puzzle!

16:08.426 --> 16:11.344
Hey, dead girl! Hold on a minute.

16:12.389 --> 16:15.343
That's Rube, he's undead.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.263
They say there are
five psychological stages of death.

16:19.396 --> 16:22.599
Ironically, this applies
even if you're already dead.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.559
Number one, denial.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.184
This is happening, this isn't real.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.570
Peanut, this is as real as it gets. You're dead.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.034
That's Betty, also undead.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.499
- This is yours.
- Mercy, that thing made a horrible noise!

16:42.627 --> 16:45.414
But... I don't remember feeling anything.

16:45.547 --> 16:50.458
- Your soul was popped out before impact.
- We do that for violent deaths, as a courtesy.

16:50.593 --> 16:54.722
- But I didn't wanna die.
- Oh, nobody does. Except suicides.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.675
They're no fun.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.180
Number two is anger.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.893
I'm only 18!
I haven't done anything! This isn't fair!

17:09.863 --> 17:14.026
So what are you? Like... angels or something?

17:14.826 --> 17:18.657
No, no, ma'am.
Angels don't get their hands dirty.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.789
You know, upper-management types.

17:21.915 --> 17:27.622
We have the unfortunate distinction
of being called grim reapers.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.591
Number is three is bargaining.

17:30.717 --> 17:35.213
Well, then can't you take somebody else?
Like, an old person?

17:35.347 --> 17:38.182
That homeless guy? I won't tell, I promise!

17:42.395 --> 17:43.771
- All right.
- Really?

17:43.897 --> 17:47.266
- No.
- Well, I want my life back!

17:47.400 --> 17:51.315
It's not like you were doing anything with it.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.439
And then there's depression.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.497
- I know what might cheer you up.
- What?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.701
Your autopsy.

18:06.628 --> 18:12.832
There's something about seeing
your body all empty, or in my case, in pieces.

18:12.967 --> 18:18.210
Rube says it's like looking at a bowl
of peach cobbler you dropped on the floor.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.598
As good as it was, you just don't want it.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.558
It sounds kinda whacked,
but it did make me feel better.

18:26.356 --> 18:30.982
- I don't get it. Why do an autopsy?
- To identify the body.

18:31.111 --> 18:36.105
- How hard can that be?
- You were hit by an object travelling 200mph,

18:36.241 --> 18:41.033
with a surface temperature exceeding
1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Do the math.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.199
I didn't know
what was more disturbing, being dead,

18:44.332 --> 18:48.661
or the fact that the first man
to touch my body was a coroner.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.544
This has been lovely,
but isn't it time I should be going?

18:52.674 --> 18:54.999
You got some place to be?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.423
I don't know? Do I?

18:57.554 --> 19:00.638
Gotta stick around
till your body's been laid to rest.

19:00.765 --> 19:03.387
I'm meat. How much rest do I need?

19:03.518 --> 19:08.678
Not important. Just say goodbye to this life
before saying hello to the next.

19:08.815 --> 19:13.643
What do you mean, "the next one"?
Am I being reincarnated or something?

19:16.031 --> 19:17.822
Don't be an ass.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.407
Everyone says the same shit at funerals.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.989
They talk about how sweet
and full of life you were,

19:27.125 --> 19:30.576
how it was your time
and you can't question God's plan.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.539
They never say anything bad.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.124
The biggest turds in the toilet
come up smelling of roses.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.379
She was a wonderful girl, so full of life.

19:40.221 --> 19:44.848
# In the afterlife
You could be heading for the serious strife

19:44.976 --> 19:47.052
# Now you make the scene all day...

19:47.187 --> 19:49.179
Get those outta here.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.729
Get out. Get out!

19:52.859 --> 19:58.066
Betty, she just loves funerals.
You'd think she'd never been to one before.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.274
# People listen attentively

20:00.408 --> 20:02.200
# I mean about future calamity

20:02.327 --> 20:04.616
# I used to think the idea was obsolete

20:04.746 --> 20:07.237
# Until I heard the old man stamping his feet...

20:07.374 --> 20:10.161
I am so very sorry for your loss.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.672
Excuse me, this seat's taken.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.884
Oh, excuse me.

20:30.939 --> 20:35.352
- How come they can see you, but not me?
- Well, peanut, you're dead.

20:35.485 --> 20:38.439
- So are you.
- Bite your tongue!

20:38.571 --> 20:42.569
- I'll have you know I am un-dead.
- What's the difference?

20:42.701 --> 20:44.989
An undead person has certain rights.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.527
For instance, I have a physical body.

20:47.664 --> 20:51.827
I can enjoy the deliciousness
of this tasty Key lime pie.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.460
And if I so choose, I can interact with the living.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.629
Observe.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.917
- How do you do, sir?
- Fine.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.259
- You can't do that.
- That sucks.

21:03.388 --> 21:08.513
For you dead types, sure,
but it keeps the riffraff in its place.

21:11.813 --> 21:15.348
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Clancy, I'm so sorry.

21:16.401 --> 21:19.022
# .. will be revealed on the other side... #

21:23.908 --> 21:28.654
Is a friendly hug between two men
supposed to last that long?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.202
And then there was Reggie.

22:13.750 --> 22:19.871
After ignoring her for ten years,
I guess it was my turn to be the invisible sister.

22:39.359 --> 22:43.309
You missed the commotion.
Your mother was bawling so hard she choked.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.020
- They almost called an ambulance.
- Really?

22:46.157 --> 22:50.570
She's a mess.
She's never gonna stop missing her little girl.

22:50.704 --> 22:54.238
Since you're Interaction Man,
can't you tell them I'm OK?

22:54.374 --> 22:57.992
- I'll get right on it.
- Then I'll tell them.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.710
How will do you do that?
Rattle chains, make lights flicker?

23:01.840 --> 23:06.336
Know how to make wind sounds?
I can do that part for you.

23:06.469 --> 23:10.052
Why do you have to be such as asshole?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.056
Oh, goddammit.

24:10.575 --> 24:15.237
- So what's next? Onward and upward?
- Onward, not upward.

24:15.372 --> 24:19.369
No Pearly Gates for you.
No choirs of angels neither.

24:19.501 --> 24:24.578
- You dick, you're sending me to hell?
- You're not that interesting.

24:24.714 --> 24:28.166
You, little dead girl, are gonna be a grim reaper.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.709
Huh?

24:30.845 --> 24:33.633
Hundreds and thousands of people die
every day.

24:33.765 --> 24:39.388
Bodies are easy: dig a ditch, light a match.
But the souls, who takes care of them?

24:40.438 --> 24:44.436
We do. We're bail bondsmen
for the disembodied.

24:45.235 --> 24:50.477
Once their souls ditch the fleshy parts, they're in
our custody till they reach their final destination.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.904
I assume you're taking about heaven?

24:53.034 --> 24:54.528
Who knows?

24:54.661 --> 24:59.904
- Whatever, I hope it's not gaudy, like the Bible.
- I like to think it's like this.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.081
So there is a God?

25:02.210 --> 25:04.119
What do you think?

25:05.046 --> 25:07.454
Willkommen. What can I get you?

25:07.590 --> 25:12.134
T-bone steak and eggs over-easy.
I want toast instead of hash browns.

25:12.262 --> 25:14.753
Syrup pancakes, and don't skimp on the butter.

25:14.889 --> 25:18.508
And some crispy bacon:
extra, extra, extra crispy.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.514
- Drink?
- Lemonade.

25:21.646 --> 25:26.273
I'm not staying. I have an appointment
downtown. Hope it's not another dead hooker.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.476
Miss?

25:31.948 --> 25:33.323
Miss?

25:35.035 --> 25:38.154
You... You said no one could see me.

25:38.288 --> 25:43.911
Before you joined the ranks of the undead.
Order before she thinks you're retarded.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.499
Uh... what he's having.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.248
Mm-hm.

25:50.008 --> 25:53.341
I'm still having trouble
with this whole "Why me?" issue.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.305
You filled someone's quota.

25:56.431 --> 26:00.429
Everyone's assigned
an unspecified allotment of souls to collect.

26:00.560 --> 26:05.352
Now, you don't know how many...
until you've nabbed the last one.

26:06.399 --> 26:11.275
Remember that weird guy who asked your name
before you got torpedoed by the toilet seat?

26:11.404 --> 26:13.029
You were his last one.

26:13.156 --> 26:17.782
So he gets promotion,
nice benefits package, and you take his place.

26:17.911 --> 26:22.786
I was glad to see him go.
He was a pain in the ass.

26:22.916 --> 26:26.783
It's like being the millionth customer,
except there's no shopping spree.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.959
You could've told me before.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.330
Pardon my savoir-faire.

26:31.466 --> 26:35.511
Dying is dramatic enough
without this stuff messing with your head.

26:35.637 --> 26:40.513
Don't get your knickers in a knot.
It's a destiny thing. Enjoy it.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.471
They kept tossing around words
like "destiny" and "fate".

26:44.604 --> 26:49.065
The word "choice" was never mentioned.
Because I didn't have one.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.186
- OK, bye.
- Bye-bye.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.858
And congratulations.

26:55.907 --> 26:58.232
Are you gonna eat your bacon?

27:01.913 --> 27:05.911
Just like that,
I became a grim reaper. Swear to God!

27:06.751 --> 27:10.369
I was born again.
But not in a creepy, religious way.

27:10.505 --> 27:13.589
All around me was a bright, shiny new world.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.839
And death was everywhere.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.965
Infectious and parasitic disease.

27:22.058 --> 27:24.134
Circulatory system disease.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.888
Malignant neoplasms.

27:27.022 --> 27:31.315
Those were the big three.
The leading causes of death worldwide.

27:31.443 --> 27:35.606
But they weren't my problem.
Grim reapers are assigned to specific divisions.

27:35.739 --> 27:39.404
My division is External Influence.
Translation...

27:40.702 --> 27:42.326
murders...

27:42.454 --> 27:43.616
suicides...

27:44.539 --> 27:46.413
accidents etc.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.664
And I do mean etc.

28:27.290 --> 28:30.659
That's Roxy.
She could kick your ass.

28:30.794 --> 28:32.952
Every reaper has their own style -

28:33.088 --> 28:36.622
those little personal touches
that make death so special.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.132
- Morning.
- Morning.

28:46.101 --> 28:49.719
You don't just stand there
waiting for a piano to drop.

28:49.854 --> 28:54.232
It's polite to take her soul at the corner,
give her some dignity.

29:05.995 --> 29:09.993
Do you get off dropping pianos on people?
Is that a fetish?

29:10.125 --> 29:14.870
- It's not our job to drop pianos or toilet seats.
- Whose job is it?

29:15.922 --> 29:19.540
- Gravelings.
- Gravelings?

29:19.676 --> 29:22.760
- Are they invisible?
- No, they're not invisible.

29:22.887 --> 29:26.221
You just can't see 'em
when you're looking at 'em.

29:26.349 --> 29:31.973
But when something's about to happen,
or just happened, you might catch a glimpse.

29:32.105 --> 29:35.059
- So just don't freak out.
- But they're real?

29:38.528 --> 29:40.604
Yeah, 'fraid so.

29:42.407 --> 29:46.405
They set things in motion,
they make the accidents happen.

29:47.287 --> 29:51.949
- They kill people?
- Life and death have to exist in perfect harmony

29:52.083 --> 29:58.086
and call it what you want,
but that balance has to be maintained.

29:59.090 --> 30:02.755
- Or else?
- Things get outta hand. That ain't pretty.

30:06.097 --> 30:08.635
What's up, pussycat? George, this is Mason.

30:08.767 --> 30:11.554
Mason. Oh, Mason, Mason, Mason!

30:11.686 --> 30:14.557
- Mason, George.
- Does this cracker talk to every...

30:14.689 --> 30:18.272
- Shh!
- You just shushed me. That's rude, man!

30:18.401 --> 30:20.857
It's disrespecting the dead.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.695
You come here.

30:22.822 --> 30:28.030
You murdered each other in a crack den.
You do not deserve my respect.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.703
Hence, shh!

30:30.789 --> 30:33.280
That's cold, man.

30:33.416 --> 30:37.414
George died a week ago
in a freak aerospace accident.

30:37.545 --> 30:40.416
Yeah, I remember you. Toilet-seat girl.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.881
Already got yourself a nickname.

30:44.010 --> 30:48.304
Toilet-seat girl needs a place to stay.
Know of any vacancies?

30:48.431 --> 30:51.800
- Place in Spring Hill might be available.
- Find out.

30:51.935 --> 30:55.101
I love you, peanut,
but you're wearing me out.

30:55.230 --> 31:00.437
I'll see to Mutt and Jeff.
Let her tag along to your 2.30.

31:00.568 --> 31:03.142
- She needs observation.
- When do you want her back?

31:03.279 --> 31:06.150
9.30am at The Waffle House.
Banana Bonanzas.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.319
There's your bus. Go with the nice man.

31:13.498 --> 31:15.906
It's rented out to some accountant.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.794
He cooked the books for some tribal casinos.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.874
He got the bills paid from an offshore account.

31:27.345 --> 31:31.639
- How did he die?
- I don't know, didn't ask.

31:34.644 --> 31:37.847
- The bills are paid until when?
- Until the account closes.

31:37.981 --> 31:39.855
- Meantime, you squat.
- As in...?

31:39.983 --> 31:43.566
As in settling in property without right
or payment of rent.

31:43.695 --> 31:47.194
- Reapers are squatters?
- Think of it as subsidised housing.

31:47.323 --> 31:51.820
- We perform a public service.
- The living probably don't think so.

31:53.538 --> 31:56.989
- What if someone shows up?
- You walk away.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.581
If you've trashed the place, you run away.

31:59.711 --> 32:03.080
- So I just crash here?
- Yeah, more or less.

32:03.214 --> 32:06.548
- Do I get keys?
- If you can find them.

32:06.676 --> 32:09.511
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

32:10.055 --> 32:13.388
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

32:13.516 --> 32:15.723
Don't get loud. What?

32:15.852 --> 32:17.512
Those are dead people.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.605
No shit.

32:21.358 --> 32:24.857
- I can't live with dead people. That's gross!
- Huh.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.317
You won't have to. Look at these bodies.

32:28.448 --> 32:32.232
Execution, execution, execution...

32:32.744 --> 32:37.205
These guys were probably tortured to death.
This was a professional job.

32:37.332 --> 32:38.992
So?

32:39.125 --> 32:44.286
So these bodies aren't just gonna lay around.
They'll disappear.

32:44.422 --> 32:48.206
They've got cleaning crews for this kind of thing.

32:48.343 --> 32:54.512
They're probably on their way now with
a couple of vats of acid and a carpet steamer.

33:01.856 --> 33:04.229
What are you doing?

33:04.359 --> 33:06.980
Collecting my salary.

33:07.112 --> 33:09.021
Leave the plastic. Cash is king.

33:10.657 --> 33:14.026
We don't get paid through proper channels?

33:16.329 --> 33:18.156
No.

33:18.289 --> 33:21.955
I kept telling myself,
"They're dead. It's a victimless crime."

33:22.085 --> 33:26.628
Then it occurred to me that
that's what guys who have sex with corpses do.

33:26.756 --> 33:30.374
There's the accountant.
Check his pocket for the keys.

33:30.510 --> 33:31.838
Oh.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.524
Um...

33:45.650 --> 33:52.613
.. not that I'm any great bastion of morality,
but isn't stealing from dead people kinda tacky?

33:53.533 --> 33:57.198
Well, it's either this... or get yourself a day job.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.698
He's not joking.

33:59.831 --> 34:02.867
The US Government doesn't provide
food stamps for grim reapers.

34:03.001 --> 34:06.500
We don't have bus passes,
or get into movies for free.

34:06.629 --> 34:10.413
Most reapers take from the dead.
Others get day jobs.

34:10.550 --> 34:14.382
Do I need to be crossing over,
passing on, or something?

34:14.512 --> 34:17.429
You ain't going nowhere until I've fill my quota.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.730
Hi. What you guys doing?

34:29.860 --> 34:33.478
- Looking for keys.
- I have 'em. I called two hours ago.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.402
- Have you got a place?
- Probate's over.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.902
My agent asked me to leave.
It was very civil.

34:40.038 --> 34:43.870
Well, shit.
Now we have to find her somewhere to stay.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.831
Can't I couch-surf with one of you
for a couple of days?

34:47.962 --> 34:50.667
That's the problem.
It's never just a couple of days.

34:50.799 --> 34:56.422
No. Two days becomes a week, a week
becomes a month, we know nothing about you...

34:56.554 --> 35:00.137
You could be crazy and you'd be in our home.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.639
You understand our position?

35:09.109 --> 35:14.447
Friends of mine at Circulatory Disease give me
the skinny on vacancies in their division.

35:14.572 --> 35:20.159
I don't normally share a privileged 411,
but I like you, Toilet Seat, you're boxy.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.074
There won't be arterial spray everywhere,
will there?

35:23.206 --> 35:27.535
Let's hope he was considerate enough
to die outside the home.

35:27.669 --> 35:29.543
Enter the angry white man.

35:29.671 --> 35:32.376
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Who are you?

35:32.507 --> 35:35.080
- Who are you, bitch?
- About the apartment...

35:35.218 --> 35:38.219
Occupied. Fuck off!

35:43.018 --> 35:46.636
- He called you "bitch".
- Maybe we should let him keep it.

35:46.771 --> 35:49.523
I'm not gonna co-sign on his bullshit.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.476
Don't call me bitch, bitch.

35:52.527 --> 35:57.355
Sorry to disturb you again.
Me and my colleagues represent the local...

35:57.490 --> 36:01.868
.. housing authority.
The tenant of 12J is deceased.

36:01.995 --> 36:04.996
- This is 12J.
- Yes, it is.

36:05.123 --> 36:09.500
- We're going to have to ask you to leave.
- I've got rights, cock-knocker.

36:09.627 --> 36:14.289
- I ain't going nowhere.
- Local and state laws on tenants rights

36:14.424 --> 36:17.378
are only applicable
to traditional rental situations.

36:17.510 --> 36:19.135
They don't cover squatting.

36:19.262 --> 36:22.927
My name's on the lease, you piece of shit!

36:24.059 --> 36:27.059
- Excuse me?
- My name's on the goddamned lease.

36:27.187 --> 36:30.520
- I want some ID.
- You're DW Manus.

36:30.648 --> 36:32.308
That's right.

36:33.360 --> 36:37.025
- You said he was dead.
- I'm alive and kicking your ass!

36:37.447 --> 36:41.148
I... I'm so embarrassed. I...

36:41.284 --> 36:43.407
- What did you do?
- I made a mistake.

36:43.536 --> 36:46.407
- Damned right.
- Excuse us!

36:53.672 --> 36:57.669
Well... he wasn't scheduled to die
until next Tuesday.

37:00.470 --> 37:05.381
- Are you shitting me?
- I thought it said the first, but it was the seventh.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.924
- That looks like a one.
- That's your writing.

37:08.061 --> 37:10.303
I feel bad enough already.

37:11.314 --> 37:14.932
- What are we gonna do?
- I think we should leave.

37:15.902 --> 37:20.481
- OK, we'll come back next Tuesday.
- Have a nice week.

37:20.615 --> 37:23.106
The angry white man kept his apartment

37:23.243 --> 37:26.493
until a coronary thrombosis terminated his lease.

37:27.539 --> 37:29.615
In the meantime, I was homeless.

37:35.714 --> 37:39.498
Do you remember when
you first asked your parents about the D-word?

37:39.634 --> 37:42.339
My dad just about shit his pants.

37:42.470 --> 37:45.424
He told me not to worry.

37:45.557 --> 37:51.761
He said most people died when they're so old,
they don't care about living any more.

37:53.648 --> 37:56.483
Sorry, I tuned you out. Were you whining?

37:56.609 --> 37:58.567
I didn't sleep for a month.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.486
As childhood traumas go,

38:00.613 --> 38:03.982
nothing beats the realisation
that everything dies.

38:06.077 --> 38:08.153
Including you.

38:09.205 --> 38:12.325
It's worse than anything
your parents could do to you.

38:12.459 --> 38:16.077
I was a happy child.
I never thought about death much.

38:17.130 --> 38:20.214
Do you guys wanna get some ice cream?

38:23.345 --> 38:26.595
Betty treated us to an ice cream and left.

38:26.723 --> 38:30.174
I had chocolate-chocolate something.
Mason had vanilla.

38:30.310 --> 38:35.102
Normally, I'd find that suspicious,
but on him, it was endearing.

38:35.231 --> 38:37.473
Hey, look.

38:37.609 --> 38:41.309
- This is what we look like to the living.
- Holy shit.

38:42.447 --> 38:44.605
# Everybody flew, flew... #

38:44.741 --> 38:50.826
Of all the things that go with
being undead, this one freaked me out the most.

38:50.955 --> 38:54.407
- Who decides what we look like?
- I don't know.

38:54.542 --> 38:58.042
Maybe this is what
our inner child looks like when it grows up.

38:58.171 --> 39:01.622
It looked
like my inner child's road to adulthood

39:01.758 --> 39:08.805
was paved with crack cocaine, ten-dollar
blow-jobs and maybe even a trick baby or two.

39:08.932 --> 39:11.221
Do you think she's pretty?

39:11.935 --> 39:16.264
- Hmm... Not as pretty as you.
- I should've said, "Thank you."

39:16.398 --> 39:22.518
I wanted to say, "Thank you,"
to smile and flirt and giggle. Instead, I said...

39:22.654 --> 39:24.860
Whatever.

39:41.256 --> 39:44.755
As the fly upon the wall,
observe, do not interact.

39:44.884 --> 39:49.012
- That's very Zen of you. You must smoke pot.
- Seriously.

39:49.139 --> 39:54.560
Some reapers believe that your appointment
with death is on the books before you're born.

39:54.686 --> 39:58.102
- What if they don't make the appointment?
- How should I know?

39:58.231 --> 40:04.352
All I'm saying is don't start moving shit around
and talking to people, because you...

40:04.487 --> 40:06.444
.. might change the outcome of events.

40:06.573 --> 40:11.235
Treat it like a retroactive crime scene.
Stick to the sidelines, look for high-risk factors.

40:11.369 --> 40:13.029
Like what?

40:14.289 --> 40:16.365
The people behind that counter.

40:19.919 --> 40:25.162
They're miserable.
Unhappy people do unhappy things.

40:25.300 --> 40:30.294
Bob's big boy on the ladder.
He could fall. He could fall on somebody.

40:30.430 --> 40:35.721
Tweeker chick. She could be free-basing
in the ladies' room. This could be an overdose.

40:35.852 --> 40:39.019
Maybe she's got her period. Lighten up.

40:39.147 --> 40:41.305
You get the picture?

40:58.083 --> 41:01.701
- A slight clue.
- Huh?

41:01.836 --> 41:06.794
A graveling in the bank lobby
with a banana peel.

41:06.925 --> 41:13.129
It might not be the graveling.
It could be murder, suicide, food poisoning.

41:13.264 --> 41:15.340
It's the banana peel.

41:16.226 --> 41:18.053
Graveling, banana peel.

41:18.770 --> 41:22.269
Let's say it is the graveling.
Banana peel's too obvious.

41:22.399 --> 41:25.435
I saw them drop a piano
on some chick's head.

41:25.568 --> 41:29.068
- They don't want points for originality.
- It's not the banana peel.

41:30.740 --> 41:34.572
If it's not the banana peel,
throw it in the garbage.

41:38.832 --> 41:40.908
Fine. I'll do it.

41:43.920 --> 41:50.208
All right! There is a possibility that it might be
the banana peel. Now sit back down.

41:54.723 --> 41:57.392
That's what I thought you would say.

41:58.768 --> 42:02.980
- So how much do we know about this person?
- Who?

42:03.106 --> 42:05.941
The one that's gonna die.

42:06.484 --> 42:10.268
Not a lot. Name's Moore, initials BM.

42:12.782 --> 42:16.447
- BM Moore?
- That's what it says.

42:20.749 --> 42:22.907
ETD is 2.36.

42:23.043 --> 42:26.494
- ETD?
- Estimated Time of Death.

42:28.548 --> 42:32.380
So is our "BM" a he or a she?

42:32.510 --> 42:34.420
I don't know.

42:34.554 --> 42:36.843
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

42:36.973 --> 42:42.180
- We get a name, an address and an ETD.
- That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

42:42.312 --> 42:46.144
- And on a Post-it note?
- The less we know, the better.

42:46.274 --> 42:49.608
- How do you figure that?
- Because it keeps it clean.

42:51.154 --> 42:56.694
It's a lot easier not to give a shit
when you don't know anything about them.

42:57.911 --> 43:02.537
So I was as the fly upon the wall.
I observed, I didn't interact.

43:02.665 --> 43:07.043
In my observations, I heard plenty of B-names
being bandied about in office gossip,

43:07.170 --> 43:09.246
but were any of them BMs?

43:10.340 --> 43:13.294
There was Byron,
the embezzling bank manager.

43:17.597 --> 43:19.839
Brenda, the office slut.

43:21.893 --> 43:24.728
Uh-huh... Yeah.

43:26.481 --> 43:27.644
Yeah.

43:27.774 --> 43:30.347
Brad, the philandering loan officer.

43:30.485 --> 43:34.613
Uh, yeah... Uh... I'll... I'll call you back.

43:37.325 --> 43:40.326
And Becky, his adoring wife.

43:45.709 --> 43:49.623
But there was one more B-name
they weren't gossiping about.

43:51.297 --> 43:52.673
Hello.

43:55.218 --> 43:57.175
Can I help you?

44:00.015 --> 44:02.766
Brett, the hapless bank robber.

44:02.892 --> 44:05.514
Everyone listen to me.

44:05.645 --> 44:11.897
This device is designed
to detect the activation of a silent alarm.

44:13.236 --> 44:17.530
If the silent alarm is detected,
I'll start killing everyone.

44:19.617 --> 44:22.108
I mean, people. I'll start killing people.

44:22.245 --> 44:24.202
He rehearsed all morning.

44:24.330 --> 44:26.240
Put your weapon on the floor.

44:27.667 --> 44:30.502
Now, now! Put it on the ground, now!

44:32.172 --> 44:34.544
Still think it's the banana peel?

44:35.592 --> 44:37.668
Kick it over to me.

44:46.144 --> 44:48.220
Everybody down on the floor, now!

44:49.522 --> 44:52.310
Now, you get out of here, now! Hurry!

44:52.442 --> 44:55.015
All of you, get down here, now!

44:57.489 --> 44:59.647
All right.

45:01.409 --> 45:06.285
Meanwhile, the philanderer and
the office slut were making sweet, sweet love...

45:12.295 --> 45:15.913
.. as they had done so many times before.

45:26.643 --> 45:28.932
Bradley! Brad!

45:29.062 --> 45:30.473
Brad?

45:31.690 --> 45:33.599
Down on the floor!

45:33.733 --> 45:37.565
Don't you point that gun at me.
I'm holding a baby.

45:37.696 --> 45:39.653
Shut up!

45:39.781 --> 45:42.948
- You shut up.
- Oh, my God!

45:43.993 --> 45:48.287
Don't stop what you're doing.
This man is waiting for his money.

45:48.415 --> 45:51.581
- How many people are supposed to die?
- Just one.

45:51.710 --> 45:55.292
- Hurry!
- I think.

45:55.422 --> 45:59.122
- You, you know Brad?
- Yes.

45:59.259 --> 46:01.714
I'm his wife.

46:01.845 --> 46:03.469
Oh.

46:05.306 --> 46:07.429
- Oh...
- Yeah, oh.

46:08.727 --> 46:10.850
Is my baby cheating on me?

46:10.979 --> 46:12.888
Uh...

46:13.023 --> 46:18.527
- Tell me the truth. Is he?
- Yes, ma'am. The whole bank knows about it.

46:19.612 --> 46:21.688
Fucker.

46:21.823 --> 46:23.899
Oh, my God.

46:25.493 --> 46:27.320
Oh, motherfucker.

46:32.959 --> 46:36.375
- How long has he been cheating on me?
- Uh...

46:36.504 --> 46:40.205
- I don't know. Two years?
- I'd say two, at least.

46:40.342 --> 46:43.177
- Did you make love to my husband?
- No, no.

46:43.303 --> 46:45.260
Brad!

46:45.388 --> 46:46.633
No, God, no.

46:47.640 --> 46:49.966
Brad? Brad, baby?

46:51.353 --> 46:55.397
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I just wanna ask you something, OK?

46:55.523 --> 46:59.651
I know you're here,
your jacket's on the back of your chair.

47:01.404 --> 47:03.029
Is he hiding back there?

47:03.156 --> 47:06.774
- I haven't seen him since his break.
- Brad!

47:08.453 --> 47:12.866
Are you back there?
Get out here right now. I mean it!

47:20.423 --> 47:22.463
You unlock this door!

47:32.852 --> 47:34.928
# In the afterlife

47:35.063 --> 47:37.139
# You could be headed for the serious strife

47:37.273 --> 47:39.266
# Now you make a scene all day

47:39.401 --> 47:41.642
# But tomorrow, there'll be hell to pay

47:41.778 --> 47:44.020
# In the afterlife

47:44.155 --> 47:46.397
# You could be headed for the serious strife

47:46.533 --> 47:48.525
# Now you make a scene all day

47:48.660 --> 47:50.451
# But tomorrow there'll be hell to pay

47:50.578 --> 47:52.286
# People listen attentively

47:52.414 --> 47:54.371
# I mean about future calamity

47:54.499 --> 47:57.120
# I used to think the idea was obsolete

47:57.252 --> 48:00.253
# Until I heard the old man stamping his feet #

48:19.566 --> 48:23.943
Nobody died.
Is that, like, kosher?

48:24.070 --> 48:26.146
It's not 2.36 yet.

48:37.167 --> 48:40.002
- Bank's closed.
- ATM's busted. I gotta cash my cheque.

48:40.128 --> 48:42.037
Sorry, bank's closed.

48:44.382 --> 48:46.956
Come on, man.

49:07.947 --> 49:11.032
You were right, it was the banana peel.

49:14.662 --> 49:16.951
Dude, that is fucked up!

49:19.668 --> 49:21.577
Wait a sec.

49:21.711 --> 49:23.870
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

49:24.005 --> 49:26.675
Sorry, man, you're dead.

49:29.928 --> 49:31.837
No way.

49:34.015 --> 49:36.304
Oh, I just got paid.

49:37.018 --> 49:39.141
Oh, man, this sucks!

49:40.522 --> 49:42.349
Do you live alone?

49:45.276 --> 49:49.654
It had a poorly-ventilated,
Third-World youth-hostel kind of charm.

49:49.781 --> 49:51.608
And there were no bodies.

49:51.741 --> 49:56.071
And of all the various and sundry stains,
none were blood or gore.

49:56.871 --> 49:59.541
I was thankful for the little things.

50:00.458 --> 50:03.578
It was official. I was on my own.

50:03.712 --> 50:10.592
I was dead, nay, undead, and not only
did I have to find a job, I had to do laundry.

50:10.719 --> 50:12.676
This was my so-called afterlife.

50:12.804 --> 50:15.924
Hypnotised by the soapy swirl
of all-temperature cheer,

50:16.057 --> 50:20.766
it occurred to me if I were alive,
my mom would be washing my sheets.

50:20.895 --> 50:25.023
They would magically appear on my bed,
crisp, clean and tucked in.

50:25.150 --> 50:28.186
Those days were over. It was all over.

50:28.319 --> 50:33.694
That didn't make it any easier to move on,
even though life had moved on without me.

50:52.635 --> 50:55.672
I felt like a pervert peeping from the shadows.

50:55.805 --> 50:59.470
I could see her, but she couldn't see me.

51:07.567 --> 51:09.856
Goddamn, she's selling my shit.

51:13.448 --> 51:15.108
Can I help you?

51:16.993 --> 51:20.243
- How much?
- That shouldn't be out here.

51:20.372 --> 51:26.291
It's got a sticker on it. 775...
You were gonna sell Frankenfruity for 775 cents?

51:26.419 --> 51:29.504
Who says you can't put a price
on childhood memories?

51:29.631 --> 51:32.798
- It's a mistake. It's not for sale.
- Why not?

51:33.551 --> 51:37.881
- 'Cause I changed my mind.
- I'll give you... five bucks for it.

51:38.556 --> 51:43.265
- I told you, it's not for sale.
- It's just a stupid toy.

51:43.395 --> 51:47.807
It was my daughter's, she's dead.
Now give me the fuckin' doll!

51:47.941 --> 51:53.279
I never heard my mom say the
F-word before. My ears were actually ringing.

51:55.115 --> 51:57.570
- Where did she get it?
- What?

51:57.701 --> 52:01.864
Frankenfruity.
I've been looking for one for a long time.

52:03.039 --> 52:07.167
She got it at a yard sale
when she was a little girl.

52:07.293 --> 52:11.920
- I doubt they make 'em now. Try eBay.
- How did your daughter die?

52:14.009 --> 52:17.378
I don't think
I wanna have this conversation with you.

52:17.512 --> 52:20.181
Well... what was she like?

52:23.518 --> 52:25.760
Why do you care?

52:26.813 --> 52:30.680
I just think it's cool she had the doll.

52:30.817 --> 52:33.059
Frankenfruity is the shit.

52:36.197 --> 52:39.613
- She drove me crazy, if you want the truth.
- What?

52:40.827 --> 52:42.903
She was stubborn.

52:43.955 --> 52:47.122
I think that's only because she was smart.

52:47.250 --> 52:49.622
Only too smart.

52:50.420 --> 52:55.841
She figured a lot of things out
way before her friends, that's for sure.

52:59.095 --> 53:01.337
We never really got along.

53:03.099 --> 53:06.551
I don't think I was a very good mother.

53:12.734 --> 53:18.404
If you want the goddamn doll, have it till
you find one, then I want this back. Understood?

53:20.283 --> 53:22.988
- Five dollars.
- It says 775 cents.

53:23.119 --> 53:28.280
You offered me five dollars.
You'll get it back when you return my doll.

53:40.887 --> 53:45.099
You need to leave now. You're making me tired.

53:49.646 --> 53:51.520
Bye.

54:00.115 --> 54:05.109
It was the longest conversation
I'd had with my mother since my periods started.

54:11.668 --> 54:14.159
And she didn't even know it was me.

54:32.105 --> 54:34.263
Get up!

54:34.899 --> 54:36.607
- Come on.
- Mom?

54:36.735 --> 54:38.526
No, not your mother.

54:38.653 --> 54:40.812
- Oh, fuck.
- What?

54:40.947 --> 54:43.734
I was hoping it was all a dream.

54:45.577 --> 54:47.902
You get dressed.

55:02.344 --> 55:05.214
- Did you get yourself a place to stay?
- Yeah.

55:05.347 --> 55:07.672
- I found a new place too.
- Yeah?

55:07.807 --> 55:09.930
Very nicely equipped, all the amenities.

55:10.060 --> 55:14.852
A Jacuzzi tub, walk-in closet
with shoes for days, and a king-size bed.

55:14.981 --> 55:18.849
- It's all about the mattress.
- Simmons, Terrace Hill, for the infirm.

55:18.985 --> 55:22.188
- You bitch.
- Babies don't sleep that good, can't afford to.

55:23.698 --> 55:26.189
So... did the waitress come back?

55:26.326 --> 55:28.484
Damn. I am thirsty.

55:29.412 --> 55:31.737
You don't mind, do you?

55:32.916 --> 55:34.992
Banana Bonanzas all around.

55:35.126 --> 55:39.338
- I was gonna have...
- The man said Banana Bonanzas all around.

55:42.592 --> 55:45.676
Banana Bonanza
and can I have more juice, please?

55:45.804 --> 55:48.295
And some water.

55:50.558 --> 55:52.634
- Bless you.
- Excuse me.

55:56.231 --> 56:02.269
- Do your nipples get hard when you sneeze?
- I, uh... don't know.

56:02.404 --> 56:06.567
- Mine do. I could put an eye out. Yours?
- Like little diamonds.

56:06.700 --> 56:10.567
Mine are always hard. I'm not sure why.

56:10.787 --> 56:13.704
I already did this guy.

56:13.832 --> 56:16.405
That was senior. This is junior.

56:16.543 --> 56:18.582
Oh. That's sad.

56:18.712 --> 56:22.081
- Should've died together, saved you a journey.
- Really though.

56:23.008 --> 56:26.875
Peanut, feel up to taking a soul today?

56:29.973 --> 56:31.348
Not really.

56:34.060 --> 56:36.100
That's too bad.

56:45.530 --> 56:47.819
Time to bust that cherry.

56:50.952 --> 56:54.286
2B or not 2B? That's the question.

56:55.790 --> 56:59.455
And for one unlucky passenger
on Coastal Link Express,

56:59.586 --> 57:02.291
it turns out I have the answer.

57:02.422 --> 57:05.921
- How do I know who?
- Car six, seat four, travelling alone.

57:06.051 --> 57:08.802
Make sure they stay in their seat.

57:14.851 --> 57:19.145
ETD is 77.277. It's gonna be violent,
so pop the soul out quick.

57:19.272 --> 57:21.561
- How violent?
- Wear your seat belt.

57:21.691 --> 57:23.767
Do trains have seat belts?

57:25.070 --> 57:28.154
- I don't think they do.
- I'm gonna vomit.

57:31.201 --> 57:35.779
Look, the first one's never easy.
I remember mine. Damn fool.

57:35.914 --> 57:37.538
He was almost vaporised.

57:37.665 --> 57:42.162
It took me ages
to find a piece big enough to pull the soul out.

57:42.295 --> 57:45.415
- What if something goes wrong?
- Well, you're already dead.

57:46.675 --> 57:48.833
- That's so not funny.
- You'll be fine.

57:48.968 --> 57:51.460
Just do everything like I showed you.

57:51.596 --> 57:55.380
- I'll see you at the next stop.
- All aboard!

58:01.523 --> 58:03.183
I was on autopilot.

58:03.316 --> 58:09.022
Every time my body took a step, my mind
screamed for it to stop and run the other way.

58:09.155 --> 58:13.367
But I kept walking.
I wondered who it was going to be.

58:13.493 --> 58:17.028
And how they planned
to get home from the train station.

58:17.163 --> 58:22.454
Were they gonna take a taxi,
or was a loved one supposed to pick them up?

58:26.256 --> 58:32.424
If I had one wish, it would be that the person
in seat four would be detained by Security

58:32.554 --> 58:38.509
for possession of narcotic substances.
Anything to keep them from getting on the train.

58:39.602 --> 58:42.603
No such luck. We have a winner.

58:43.398 --> 58:47.396
I began to fantasise about what a bitch she was,

58:47.527 --> 58:51.276
how everybody hated her,
that she was barren, had no children...

58:51.406 --> 58:53.482
Then this happened.

58:56.703 --> 58:58.411
Her name's Kirsti.

59:07.005 --> 59:08.464
All aboard!

59:10.884 --> 59:15.427
She's in kindergarten.
She loves drawing and playing with Lego.

59:15.555 --> 59:19.006
Her favourite food
is French fries and apple sauce...

59:19.142 --> 59:21.218
.. and she has to die.

59:38.244 --> 59:40.782
This is why having a destiny sucks.

59:40.914 --> 59:44.283
I stared at her seat for what seemed like hours,

59:44.417 --> 59:47.620
thinking about
all the things I'd rather be doing, like...

59:47.754 --> 59:51.454
.. having a root canal,
or a Pap smear, or going to church.

59:58.306 --> 01:00:00.678
Sure beats flying, don't it?

01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:03.810
What? Oh, yeah, I guess.

01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:07.804
All the tequila in Mexico
couldn't get me on a plane.

01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:13.066
- When I was about your age...
- I can't talk to you now... I'm praying.

01:00:14.906 --> 01:00:16.281
Oh.

01:00:40.598 --> 01:00:44.596
If only I could close my eyes
and wish all this away,

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:47.135
wish it into the cornfield or whatever.

01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:56.735
I'd open my eyes and I'd start over,
I'd do everything right.

01:00:56.865 --> 01:01:01.076
I wouldn't drop out of college,
work in some crap job, or die.

01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:59.007
- Hi.
- Do you work for the railroad?

01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:00.167
No.

01:02:00.303 --> 01:02:03.838
I can't talk to you
unless you work for the railroad.

01:02:03.973 --> 01:02:06.346
OK, I work for the railroad.

01:02:07.435 --> 01:02:10.009
Where's your uniform?

01:02:10.146 --> 01:02:12.269
It's at the cleaners', OK?

01:02:14.567 --> 01:02:16.893
- What's your name?
- Kirsti.

01:02:17.612 --> 01:02:20.186
I didn't know what to say.

01:02:20.323 --> 01:02:25.115
They don't cover this sort of thing
on Sesame Street. So I asked...

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:27.118
Ever been to Sea World?

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:29.323
Magic Mountain?

01:02:29.457 --> 01:02:32.791
- Disneyland?
- I like Donald Duck.

01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:35.544
Yeah, me too.

01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:42.294
You know how you spend all day
riding all the rides and you don't want to stop?

01:02:45.223 --> 01:02:49.766
And your parents say it's time to go home,
only you're not ready yet?

01:02:49.894 --> 01:02:55.730
You want to go on one more ride, but you can't?
And it's not fair, you're pissed off that...

01:02:57.068 --> 01:03:00.022
Is any of this making any sense?

01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:17.168
Why don't you come sit with me?

01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:20.083
Miss? Everything all right?

01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:22.886
- We're just changing seats.
- Do you know her?

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:25.466
I don't know her.

01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:29.215
- You should go to your assigned seats.
- She'll sit with me.

01:03:44.949 --> 01:03:46.776
Sit down. Hold onto something.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.902
Mr Blinky!

01:04:30.328 --> 01:04:32.784
Everyone OK?

01:04:32.914 --> 01:04:35.666
There were ten passengers in this car.

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:40.754
I'll count you all off.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.502
One... two...

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.008
.. three...

01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:47.713
.. four...

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:50.467
Sweet Kirsti with her baby-doll dress

01:04:50.598 --> 01:04:54.014
and patent leather Mary Janes
was alive and well.

01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:58.181
I secretly hoped
that this was grounds for a termination.

01:04:58.690 --> 01:05:02.308
-.. ten.
- That was one more than there should be.

01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:05.441
We're all here.

01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:19.657
Fortunately, the trauma
of our collective near-death experience

01:05:19.794 --> 01:05:22.581
kept conversation to a minimum.

01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:35.010
We're probably not too far from Highway 20.

01:05:35.143 --> 01:05:37.716
I'm sure rescue teams are on their way.

01:05:37.854 --> 01:05:40.772
I suggest we keep warm
and count our blessings.

01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:43.686
Miss? We should stick together.

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:47.227
I have to pee.

01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:49.522
Stay close.

01:06:04.547 --> 01:06:07.335
- Rube, where are you?
- Keep it down.

01:06:07.467 --> 01:06:10.836
You could've told me it was a little girl, you dick!

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:15.632
- What difference does it make?
- It makes all the difference. Why her?

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.843
Why do you think?

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:22.724
- She showed up for her appointment.
- Then you should've rescheduled.

01:06:22.857 --> 01:06:24.933
That's not how it works.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:28.225
You just can't change fate.

01:06:28.363 --> 01:06:30.320
I did.

01:06:32.617 --> 01:06:34.028
What did you do?

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:36.952
What did you do?

01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:41.534
She's not dead. I didn't remove her soul.

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:47.790
What do you think you're doing?

01:06:47.924 --> 01:06:49.715
I'm letting her live.

01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:54.881
Cardinal rule: everybody dies.

01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:59.434
You'd better march over there
and take her soul.

01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:04.602
- If you want her to die, you do it.
- Only you can. Death is non-transferable.

01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:08.565
She's your mark. Only you can do the deed.

01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:12.064
Then barring any accidents,
I'd say she has another 80 years.

01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:15.033
You believe me,
that's 80 years she doesn't want.

01:07:17.245 --> 01:07:19.653
What is that supposed to mean?

01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:24.001
Her fate was sealed when she stepped
onto that train, her soul expired.

01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:27.662
Know what happens
if you keep souls around after their time?

01:07:27.797 --> 01:07:32.459
It's like milk. Spoils.
Souls go bad in all kinds of ways.

01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:35.429
If you don't understand
the severity of the situation,

01:07:35.555 --> 01:07:39.138
why don't you consult Webster's
on the definition of "bad"?

01:07:40.977 --> 01:07:46.647
If you don't take her soul,
it will wither and die and rot inside her.

01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:50.066
I've seen it happen.

01:07:52.364 --> 01:07:55.364
Do you wish to condemn her to that?

01:07:55.492 --> 01:07:57.568
She's just a little girl.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.743
She can't die. It's cruel.

01:08:00.872 --> 01:08:02.663
It is cruel.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:06.828
It's cruel she'll never know what life is really like,

01:08:06.961 --> 01:08:10.710
cruel she'll miss out
on so much love and pain and beauty.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:16.214
I'd say it for everyone, except her. She won't
care, she'll be doing something different.

01:08:17.263 --> 01:08:19.303
That's just the way it is.

01:08:23.603 --> 01:08:26.094
I just wanted to save her.

01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:30.100
You can't.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:35.104
You can't save any of them.

01:08:36.157 --> 01:08:38.827
All you can do is make it easier.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:43.738
That may not seem like a lot, but it is.

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:00.513
Go on.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:31.493
I don't know if this is what I'm supposed to say...

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:36.584
I... I mean, you...

01:09:42.098 --> 01:09:45.099
Do me a favour, just close your eyes.

01:10:15.632 --> 01:10:21.088
# When I was just a little girl

01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:23.926
# I asked my mother

01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:26.595
# What will I be?

01:10:28.269 --> 01:10:31.852
# Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?

01:10:31.981 --> 01:10:33.891
We're gonna go for a ride.

01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:37.608
# Here's what she said to me

01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:42.401
# Que sera sera

01:10:43.827 --> 01:10:47.694
# Whatever will be will be

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:55.627
# The future's not ours to see

01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:58.507
# Que sera sera

01:11:02.303 --> 01:11:07.215
# When I wasjust a child in school

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:09.592
- Wait!
- You can't go where she's going.

01:11:09.728 --> 01:11:13.939
# I asked my teacher, what should I try?

01:11:15.608 --> 01:11:18.609
- What is it?
- It's not for us to know.

01:11:18.737 --> 01:11:21.524
# Should I sing songs?

01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:25.950
# This was her wise reply

01:11:26.077 --> 01:11:30.241
# Que sera sera

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:35.995
# Whatever will be will be...

01:11:37.213 --> 01:11:39.669
As we walked into the dark unknown,

01:11:39.799 --> 01:11:44.426
or whatever you want to call it,
I thought, "Is this it?"

01:11:44.554 --> 01:11:46.630
"Is this who I am?"

01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:48.841
"Am I really a grim reaper?"

01:12:16.086 --> 01:12:19.537
I think for me, death was just a wake-up call.

01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:41.940
# When I grew up and fell in love

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:45.275
# I asked my sweetheart

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:47.862
# What lies ahead?

01:12:49.661 --> 01:12:54.868
# Will there be rainbows, day after day?

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:59.332
# Here's what my sweetheart said

01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:03.581
# Que sera sera

01:13:05.301 --> 01:13:09.513
# Whatever will be will be

01:13:11.391 --> 01:13:15.436
# The future's not ours to see

01:13:16.563 --> 01:13:18.935
# Que sera sera #
