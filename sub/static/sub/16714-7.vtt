00:12.747 --> 00:13.820
Gabriel?

00:14.534 --> 00:15.663
You're gonna be ok.

00:16.885 --> 00:20.753
JJ, we found him. What
do you have on your end?

00:20.755 --> 00:22.889
No, no, no. Don't look at that.

00:22.891 --> 00:27.727
Look at me. Keep your eyes
on me right here, right here.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.168
Stop, stop that. Stop.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.336
It's engaging!

00:36.338 --> 00:37.972
Stop. No, no, no, no, no!

00:40.623 --> 00:43.321
_

00:49.978 --> 00:52.646
I come bearing office-warming gifts.

00:52.648 --> 00:55.982
Oh, that is so nice. Thank you.

00:55.984 --> 00:58.118
So, how's it going?

00:58.120 --> 00:59.586
Weird.

00:59.588 --> 01:00.954
Yeah?

01:00.956 --> 01:03.456
It started with the I'm
gonna hurl first day jitters,

01:03.458 --> 01:04.757
but now there's this.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.594
I was able to increase the
budget to hire a new agent.

01:07.596 --> 01:09.095
That's great.

01:09.097 --> 01:10.630
Yeah. Anyway, what's up?

01:10.632 --> 01:12.799
I was just checking to
see if we had a case.

01:12.801 --> 01:13.800
We don't.

01:13.802 --> 01:14.734
We don't?

01:14.736 --> 01:17.104
No. I can double-check, but...

01:17.606 --> 01:18.839
Uh, Garcia.

01:19.887 --> 01:20.953
Ma'am.

01:21.050 --> 01:22.283
Please stop calling me ma'am.

01:22.285 --> 01:24.051
Uh, we haven't been called
in anywhere, have we?

01:24.053 --> 01:26.387
No. As of 9:27 Eastern Standard Time,

01:26.389 --> 01:28.022
all serial killers
have taken the day off.

01:28.024 --> 01:29.223
Maybe they went to therapy.

01:29.225 --> 01:32.326
Frankly, I could use the
time to review these resumes.

01:32.328 --> 01:35.162
Well, if we're good here, I
need to take the day off-campus.

01:35.164 --> 01:37.064
Is that a problem?

01:37.066 --> 01:38.132
No, not at all.

01:38.134 --> 01:39.834
Thanks.

01:41.104 --> 01:43.170
Is she...

01:43.172 --> 01:46.107
Don't. She has sworn me to secrecy.

01:46.109 --> 01:48.142
Ok. Fair enough. Never mind.

01:48.144 --> 01:50.411
All right!

01:50.413 --> 01:53.281
Twist my arm. I'll tell you. Follow me.

01:55.685 --> 01:56.984
Let's face it.

01:56.986 --> 02:00.521
We don't really know
much about Dr. Tara Lewis.

02:00.523 --> 02:02.723
We know she's an army brat

02:02.725 --> 02:03.891
who was raised all over the world.

02:03.893 --> 02:05.359
I know, because she told me yesterday,

02:05.361 --> 02:07.561
that her mother died of breast
cancer when she was in college,

02:07.563 --> 02:09.663
and then her dad was
honorably discharged,

02:09.666 --> 02:12.366
and he started an auto
repair shop in D.C.

02:12.368 --> 02:15.936
But what I just learned is that her
most complicated family relationship

02:15.938 --> 02:17.271
is with this guy.

02:17.273 --> 02:19.240
Gabriel, her younger brother,

02:19.242 --> 02:21.442
every bit as smart as Tara.

02:21.444 --> 02:23.978
He got a 1,600 on his SATs,

02:23.980 --> 02:27.381
and he didn't go to Yale,
despite having a free ride.

02:27.383 --> 02:28.482
Huh.

02:28.484 --> 02:29.750
Instead, he got involved

02:29.752 --> 02:32.219
in a bunch of get-rich-quick
schemes bordering on fraud.

02:32.221 --> 02:35.189
Apparently Tara, after
bailing him out of bankruptcy,

02:35.191 --> 02:37.425
said, look, Gabriel,
this cannot happen again.

02:37.427 --> 02:42.029
And then he turned his
back on her. Scandal?

02:42.031 --> 02:44.799
Enter, or rather re-enter, the father.

02:44.801 --> 02:46.267
He's distraught that
his children are feuding.

02:46.269 --> 02:48.636
He want them to patch things up
so they can be a family again,

02:48.638 --> 02:52.106
and, today, Gabriel is flying in.

02:52.108 --> 02:53.841
Him and Tara have agreed
to meet at a coffee shop.

02:53.843 --> 02:55.943
They're going to swallow
their pride and maybe,

02:55.945 --> 03:01.449
just maybe, they will
put the past behind them.

03:01.451 --> 03:02.883
Sweet, right?

03:02.885 --> 03:04.251
Yeah, it's
really...

03:04.253 --> 03:05.586
No, it's terrible, because
what if he asks for money?

03:05.588 --> 03:08.222
What if she can't say no?
What if she gets caught up

03:08.224 --> 03:10.458
in his whirlwind of manipulation?

03:10.460 --> 03:11.926
Did she put it that way?

03:11.928 --> 03:14.128
No, I did. But I can't
help but be super vigilant

03:14.130 --> 03:17.565
when it comes to people I love, and I'll
go through all the worst-case scenarios.

03:17.567 --> 03:18.632
I'm vigilant myself.

03:18.634 --> 03:19.600
What's going on?

03:19.602 --> 03:20.668
It's Gabriel.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.136
Oh.

03:22.138 --> 03:24.839
How did... how come
you guys know about...

03:24.841 --> 03:27.641
Uh, she told us about him
when she first joined the team.

03:27.643 --> 03:30.444
He flew in this morning,
probably looking for money.

03:30.446 --> 03:33.247
Hey. Is there a case?

03:33.249 --> 03:35.850
What's Tara's brother's
picture doing up?

03:35.852 --> 03:37.385
Well, he's in town.

03:37.387 --> 03:38.886
He must want money.

03:39.722 --> 03:42.723
Come on, the new guy?

03:42.725 --> 03:45.259
He knows? How come I
was the last one to know?

03:45.261 --> 03:47.595
It was an experiment. She
wanted to time how long

03:47.597 --> 03:49.463
you could keep a private
conversation private.

03:49.465 --> 03:52.600
And you made it 12 hours.

03:53.803 --> 03:57.204
Damn. I had you down for 6.

03:57.206 --> 03:59.807
Ok, you know what? You guys,
I thought you were my friends.

03:59.809 --> 04:01.942
But you suck. You all suck.

04:01.944 --> 04:05.913
Especially you, new guy.
But then you always suck.

04:05.915 --> 04:08.716
Newbie.

04:08.718 --> 04:11.218
I had 14 hours. I think I win, right?

04:11.220 --> 04:13.087
Uh, who had 11?

04:13.089 --> 04:14.622
Oh, I did.

04:14.624 --> 04:16.458
Ahh. Ha ha.

04:22.098 --> 04:25.433
There she is.

04:25.435 --> 04:27.334
Uh, excuse me?

04:27.336 --> 04:28.702
How you doin', girl?

04:28.704 --> 04:30.571
You haven't changed a bit.

04:30.573 --> 04:31.906
Now, how does that work?

04:31.908 --> 04:34.175
Do you get younger every
time you add more initials

04:34.177 --> 04:35.776
to the Lewis family name?

04:35.778 --> 04:39.914
You've got PhD, FBI, BAU.

04:39.916 --> 04:42.750
This is, uh, this is embarrassing.

04:42.752 --> 04:45.820
I... you obviously know me,

04:45.822 --> 04:49.356
but I don't remember you.

04:49.358 --> 04:50.658
You playin'?

04:50.660 --> 04:52.560
No.

04:54.096 --> 04:57.465
Look, I came here because
Dad asked me to come.

04:57.467 --> 04:58.632
But if this... this how you gonna...

04:58.634 --> 05:01.335
Stop. Stop right there.

05:01.337 --> 05:02.870
I want you to get up from this table

05:02.872 --> 05:04.438
and I want you to walk out of here.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.407
I don't know who you are,

05:06.409 --> 05:10.578
but I have a badge and
a very, very short fuse.

05:12.915 --> 05:14.448
Good seeing you, T.

05:14.450 --> 05:16.750
Do not call me that.

05:16.752 --> 05:20.120
The only person I let call me that is...

05:25.027 --> 05:26.293
Give me your phone.

05:26.295 --> 05:28.095
No.

05:28.097 --> 05:31.165
Hell, no. I'm not giving you my phone.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.366
Give me your phone

05:32.368 --> 05:35.269
or I will arrest you and
I will take it from you.

05:38.641 --> 05:40.407
Jeez.

05:52.788 --> 05:54.154
Who are you?

05:54.156 --> 05:57.358
Who am I?

05:57.360 --> 06:00.227
Tara, it's me, Gabriel.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.829
Your brother.

Marian Sandmaier.

06:52.836 --> 06:55.137
Really?

06:56.273 --> 07:00.108
If this is your way
of burying the hatchet,

07:00.110 --> 07:03.779
you got a funny way of showing it...

07:03.781 --> 07:05.046
Tara.

07:07.584 --> 07:10.118
We're running prints and DNA.
So far he's not in the system.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.087
We can hold that man for 24 hours.

07:12.089 --> 07:14.556
After that we need to either
charge him or let him go.

07:14.558 --> 07:16.057
Is Gabriel answering his phone?

07:16.059 --> 07:19.528
This is his phone. His
contacts, his emails.

07:19.530 --> 07:20.662
Look at this.

07:20.664 --> 07:22.130
He was in the Capitol Hill district.

07:22.132 --> 07:24.032
And look at the time stamp.

07:24.034 --> 07:25.867
He's been in my backyard a
month and he hasn't told me.

07:25.869 --> 07:26.968
Does your father know?

07:26.970 --> 07:28.837
Maybe. I mean, I have to speak to him.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.173
Albert Lewis body shop. He's
listed, right? I'll bring him in.

07:31.175 --> 07:33.675
Ok, process that and break it down.

07:33.677 --> 07:35.243
Aye aye.

07:37.247 --> 07:40.582
Just why would Gabriel send a stranger

07:40.584 --> 07:42.117
to meet me and pretend it's him?

07:42.119 --> 07:43.518
It makes no sense.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.786
Maybe he's scared,

07:44.788 --> 07:46.888
or maybe it's another
one of his scams, but...

07:46.890 --> 07:49.958
Tara, let's talk.

07:51.295 --> 07:53.795
Um, what is this?

07:53.797 --> 07:55.397
Am I in trouble?

07:55.399 --> 07:57.265
Just the opposite.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.400
If someone's messing with you,

07:58.402 --> 07:59.734
they're messing with all of us.

07:59.736 --> 08:01.102
And it's happening directly on the heels

08:01.104 --> 08:02.871
of Hotch entering the WITSEC program.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.306
We have to be hyper vigilant.

08:04.308 --> 08:06.408
I agree. I'd like to start
by questioning the suspect.

08:06.410 --> 08:07.476
No.

08:07.478 --> 08:09.277
Look, if this is because

08:09.279 --> 08:10.512
I'm too close to the case...

08:10.514 --> 08:12.147
We need to treat the
man you just brought in

08:12.149 --> 08:14.850
as an unsub posing as your brother.

08:14.852 --> 08:17.586
What would interrogation
strategy call for at this point?

08:17.588 --> 08:19.221
Uh, get him frustrated.

08:19.223 --> 08:21.423
Force a mistake by
denying him what he wants.

08:21.425 --> 08:23.058
And what does he want?

08:23.060 --> 08:25.427
Me.

08:26.296 --> 08:27.329
So you can't go in.

08:27.331 --> 08:31.834
So, who are we gonna
send in instead of you?

08:32.336 --> 08:34.402
Good afternoon.

08:34.404 --> 08:37.639
I'm Jennifer Jareau
with the Behavioral...

08:37.640 --> 08:38.974
Analysis Unit of the FBI.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.741
Tara told me you were cool.

08:40.744 --> 08:44.044
All right.

08:44.047 --> 08:45.780
And you are?

08:45.782 --> 08:48.116
Gabriel, her brother.

08:49.086 --> 08:52.787
Could I get your full
name and social, please?

08:52.789 --> 08:54.956
Gabriel Anthony Lewis.

08:54.958 --> 08:59.528
989-42-7001.

09:01.298 --> 09:03.798
That is Tara's brother.

09:05.402 --> 09:08.470
See the problem here?

09:08.472 --> 09:10.138
What? It's a driver's license photo.

09:10.140 --> 09:12.073
They asked me not to smile.

09:12.075 --> 09:14.876
No hesitation. No upspeak.

09:14.878 --> 09:16.478
He maintains eye contact.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.847
Whoever this guy is, he's good.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.683
Let's see how he does
at double jeopardy.

09:21.685 --> 09:23.552
Where were you born?

09:23.554 --> 09:25.253
Army base, Fort Rucker.

09:25.255 --> 09:26.855
Right. In, uh, Georgia?

09:26.857 --> 09:28.523
No. Alabama.

09:28.525 --> 09:30.091
With stops in Okinawa and Hamburg?

09:30.093 --> 09:31.459
Other way around. Hamburg first.

09:31.461 --> 09:33.695
What did you major in at Yale?

09:33.697 --> 09:36.398
I didn't.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.734
What is going on here?

09:39.736 --> 09:44.806
Why are you the only one
that gets to call her T.?

09:46.310 --> 09:48.143
We're going there, huh?

09:51.782 --> 09:54.783
Her name is spelled T-A-R-A.

09:54.785 --> 09:58.053
It was my father's grandmother's name.

09:58.055 --> 10:00.121
You know what else is spelled T-A-R-A?

10:00.123 --> 10:02.757
Tara. The plantation in
"Gone with the Wind."

10:02.759 --> 10:05.293
Some movie most black
folks aren't crazy about.

10:05.295 --> 10:07.562
So my mom and dad, they
drilled it into her,

10:07.564 --> 10:10.265
it's Tar-a, Tar-a, Tar-a.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.434
And every time we went to a new school,

10:12.436 --> 10:14.436
which was every time
my dad got re-stationed,

10:14.438 --> 10:16.538
she had to make sure our
classmates got it right.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.006
- You feel me?
- Yeah, I do.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.008
Good. So while we're in Hamburg,

10:20.010 --> 10:22.577
this kid starts following her
around and he starts saying,

10:22.579 --> 10:26.181
Terra, Terra, Terra, Terra.

10:26.183 --> 10:29.517
Now, he never seen Vivien
Leigh or Clark Gable

10:29.519 --> 10:32.787
or "I don't know nothin'
about birthin' no babies."

10:32.789 --> 10:35.957
He just knew that he was
getting underneath her skin.

10:39.863 --> 10:43.465
And my sister said...

10:54.378 --> 10:57.646
Go on. What did she say?

10:59.750 --> 11:03.284
What happened next is our secret.

11:03.286 --> 11:05.120
Mine and hers.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.490
I wouldn't tell the
rest just to anybody.

11:08.492 --> 11:11.326
My sister knows that.

11:11.328 --> 11:13.695
All that matters for this
little back and forth,

11:13.697 --> 11:15.864
which I'm guessing she put you up to

11:15.866 --> 11:19.601
is afterward I started calling her T...

11:19.603 --> 11:23.471
To show her that I
was always on her side.

11:26.076 --> 11:29.811
Even now, T.

11:29.813 --> 11:31.846
Even now.

11:35.185 --> 11:38.019
Reid's back with your father.

11:44.027 --> 11:45.161
Tara.

11:46.363 --> 11:48.064
Hey, Dad.

11:49.266 --> 11:52.701
You knew Gabriel was in the District?

11:52.703 --> 11:53.735
Yes.

11:53.737 --> 11:56.271
Why didn't you tell me?

11:56.273 --> 11:58.940
Because I was afraid you
wouldn't even sit down for coffee

11:58.942 --> 12:00.508
if you knew why your brother was here.

12:00.510 --> 12:02.010
Why is he here?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.945
He got a new job.

12:03.947 --> 12:05.346
He's a lobbyist.

12:05.348 --> 12:07.749
A lobbyist?

12:07.751 --> 12:10.819
What lobby would hire Gabriel?

12:10.821 --> 12:12.987
A group that's pursuing
a constitutional amendment

12:12.989 --> 12:15.957
to legalize online
gambling in all 50 states.

12:15.959 --> 12:17.125
Oh, my god.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.626
No, no, no, no.

12:18.628 --> 12:21.629
Online gambling sounds bad.

12:21.631 --> 12:24.833
It's all those sport leagues that
everyone's joining these days.

12:24.835 --> 12:27.736
Look, if Gabriel and his
partner gets this passed,

12:27.738 --> 12:29.637
they'll be on the ground floor of...

12:29.639 --> 12:31.873
An amazing business opportunity?

12:31.875 --> 12:35.543
Do you know who the partner is?

12:35.545 --> 12:37.645
No. I haven't met him.

12:37.647 --> 12:41.216
But he sounds nice. He's letting
your brother stay at his place.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.518
I'm gonna need a name and an address.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.754
Ok, here's what I can tell
you about Carl Brubaker.

12:45.756 --> 12:47.522
He does in fact live in the city,

12:47.524 --> 12:49.324
and the GPS on Gabriel's phone

12:49.326 --> 12:51.760
has been consistently
there for the last month.

12:51.762 --> 12:53.795
So he had been staying with
him like my father said.

12:53.797 --> 12:57.232
Maybe he still is but our unsub
got ahold of his phone somehow.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.268
With my brother it's never that
simple. Something else is going on.

13:00.270 --> 13:01.469
Guys, we're being set up.

13:01.471 --> 13:02.637
What do you mean, Reid?

13:02.639 --> 13:04.606
The face in the driver's license photo

13:04.608 --> 13:06.241
displays perfect facial symmetry,

13:06.243 --> 13:08.376
I mean perfect, beyond what
the human genome can produce.

13:08.378 --> 13:10.011
The picture's a
computer-generated forgery.

13:10.013 --> 13:13.181
Who would hack into the
DMV and plant a fake...

13:15.418 --> 13:18.453
Alvez, step on it.

13:28.832 --> 13:30.732
FBI! Anybody here?

13:30.734 --> 13:32.400
Luke!

13:32.402 --> 13:33.501
That's Gabriel.

13:33.503 --> 13:34.702
Gabriel, where are you?!

13:34.704 --> 13:36.404
Luke!

13:50.854 --> 13:52.887
Luke!

13:52.889 --> 13:54.556
Luke!

13:56.893 --> 13:58.226
Luke!

14:06.803 --> 14:08.736
Luke!

14:16.079 --> 14:18.246
Luke!

14:18.248 --> 14:20.014
It's on a loop.

14:20.016 --> 14:21.249
Luke! Luke!

14:21.251 --> 14:23.918
Luke! Luke!

14:23.920 --> 14:25.186
Luke!

14:26.590 --> 14:28.156
Luke!

14:28.158 --> 14:30.325
Luke can't help you now.

14:31.461 --> 14:33.194
Luke!

14:34.364 --> 14:36.264
Aah!

14:36.266 --> 14:39.400
Mr. Scratch has my brother.

14:42.778 --> 14:46.613
I've placed protective details on
Hayden and Joy and Will and the boys.

14:46.615 --> 14:50.150
We need to assume that Mr. Scratch
is targeting this entire team.

14:50.152 --> 14:53.420
You know, that could be why he
had Gabriel screaming out my name.

14:53.422 --> 14:56.690
He wants us to know that he
knows I'm part of the BAU now.

14:56.692 --> 15:00.060
Isn't his M.O. to drug his
victims and make them hallucinate?

15:00.062 --> 15:03.430
Then he evolved. He's taking these
victims with multiple personalities

15:03.432 --> 15:05.666
and brainwashing them with
someone else's memories.

15:05.668 --> 15:08.735
So he took Tara's brother
and did God knows what

15:08.737 --> 15:10.270
to get him to spill his life story,

15:10.272 --> 15:12.973
and then he planted those
memories in the guy downstairs.

15:12.975 --> 15:15.810
The more memories he has, the
stronger the identity he can create.

15:16.013 --> 15:18.547
He must have put Gabriel's
whole life inside of Desmond.

15:18.547 --> 15:20.485
Well, the good news is we
have a list from before.

15:20.485 --> 15:23.996
Patients with disassociative identity
disorder Scratch might target next.

15:23.996 --> 15:26.182
Ok, cross-reference those
against missing persons.

15:26.479 --> 15:29.920
The rest of us need to figure out
how to deprogram the unsub safely.

15:30.110 --> 15:32.583
He's still our best lead
to Scratch and Gabriel.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.121
It's the pictures that are baffling.

15:34.121 --> 15:37.650
Scratch left them out specifically
to call our attention to them.

15:37.650 --> 15:40.451
He's a math genius. He likes
us to solve his puzzles,

15:40.451 --> 15:42.641
which usually tend to
lead to bigger traps.

15:42.641 --> 15:45.260
But it's the configuration
that's strange.

15:45.260 --> 15:48.141
The pictures are obviously
of Gabriel at different ages,

15:48.143 --> 15:49.340
but normally one would arrange them

15:49.340 --> 15:51.817
in chronological or
reverse chronological order.

15:51.817 --> 15:55.673
15, 11, and 32 is a pattern
that he wants us to see.

15:55.954 --> 15:58.259
Not us. Tara.

15:58.259 --> 16:00.788
It's a pattern he wants her to see.

16:03.695 --> 16:08.031
Uh, yes. I remember this.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.467
His 32nd birthday party.

16:10.469 --> 16:14.371
Ah. His sixth grade graduation.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.306
He made the Honor Roll that year.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.208
Yeah. He did every year.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.611
Huh. This one I don't remember.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.647
Yeah. Neither do I.

16:24.649 --> 16:25.849
15.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.884
That was, uh...

16:27.886 --> 16:29.686
That was when your mother died.

16:31.279 --> 16:33.979
That part of my life is a blur.

16:35.249 --> 16:37.316
What'd he do this time?

16:37.318 --> 16:39.885
Um...

16:39.887 --> 16:44.123
Dad, it's worse than that.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.392
Gabriel's been kidnapped,

16:46.394 --> 16:49.528
by someone my team has been hunting.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.598
What, someone dangerous?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.233
Yes.

16:55.787 --> 16:57.597
Is my son dead?

16:58.105 --> 16:59.871
Honestly, Dad, I don't know.

17:01.043 --> 17:02.514
I tried.

17:02.844 --> 17:05.478
I really, really, tried.

17:07.781 --> 17:11.284
But the two of you were just,
you were just so different.

17:11.286 --> 17:12.652
You...

17:12.654 --> 17:14.890
I never had to worry about you.

17:15.248 --> 17:17.390
But your brother...

17:19.527 --> 17:21.761
Your brother, he...

17:21.762 --> 17:25.498
He needed something different.

17:25.500 --> 17:31.437
Something I... That I
just couldn't give him.

17:31.439 --> 17:33.639
I...

17:35.877 --> 17:39.212
Daddy, you did your best.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.237
Now it's my turn.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.795
Pause the video.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.497
Zoom in on the wrist, Garcia.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.232
That rope, it's called shibari.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.901
It's an intricate form of BDSM bondage.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.636
The last time Mr. Scratch
needed BDSM gear,

17:51.638 --> 17:52.803
he used a fake name. My name, actually.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.105
My name, actually, to buy it.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.941
Well, maybe he did the same
thing with Carl Brubaker.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.110
It could give us another
location Scratch is hiding at.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.511
Garcia, can you run financials?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.113
Yes, I will.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.449
And my search of
possible D.I.D. patients/

18:05.451 --> 18:08.619
potential victims is going to
give us a much needed break.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.290
I know that name.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.125
Here's the good news. I've
confirmed that this man

18:14.127 --> 18:15.993
is Desmond Holt. He was diagnosed

18:15.995 --> 18:17.929
with dissociative identity disorder

18:17.931 --> 18:19.563
after his mother died and his stepfather

18:19.565 --> 18:21.832
started to make him play
Russian roulette regularly.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.867
That's the good news?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.201
Oh, yeah, because the bad news

18:24.203 --> 18:27.004
is I got a video from
Desmond's therapist,

18:27.006 --> 18:28.606
Dr. Lawrence, who was very concerned

18:28.608 --> 18:29.640
when Desmond went missing.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.543
This is why.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.245
Desmond.

18:34.247 --> 18:38.082
Desmond. Desmond, I need
you to come back to me.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.251
Desmond, please.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.921
She tried to get Desmond to
recognize his other identities,

18:43.923 --> 18:47.358
he went into a disassociative
break for 6 months.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.461
So if we get Desmond to
see he's not Tara's brother,

18:50.463 --> 18:52.129
we could end up doing the same thing?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.433
Oh, Dr. Lawrence is
surprised we haven't already.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.935
You know the plan where we don't
give the unsub what he wants?

18:57.937 --> 18:59.770
Yep. New plan.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.039
We give him everything he wants.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.875
You're not to mention Desmond
Holt, Franklin, Tennessee,

19:04.877 --> 19:07.345
multiple personalities, or Mr. Scratch.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.846
Got it.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.548
You have to treat him
like he's your brother.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.884
Considering the hostility and
dismissal we've subjected him to,

19:13.886 --> 19:16.520
it's a small miracle
he's not drooling yet.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.155
Not really.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.791
When it comes to my brother,
hostility and dismissal

19:20.793 --> 19:22.393
are my specialty.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.575
I guess you're pretty angry, huh?

19:37.577 --> 19:40.277
Angry? I came here thinking
I was gonna have a chance

19:40.279 --> 19:42.813
to make things better with my sister,

19:42.815 --> 19:45.950
but instead, she had me arrested.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.152
Why would I be mad over
a little thing like that?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.854
I know this is all confusing,

19:49.856 --> 19:54.859
but I need some answers.
Ok, these photographs.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.828
I recognize these two,

19:57.830 --> 20:01.065
but not this one.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.433
I need your help.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.668
I've been screaming for you for hours.

20:04.670 --> 20:07.104
When you finally come here,
you treat me like always.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.973
- Ok.
- Don't just dismiss it, T.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.674
This is the way it always is. But...

20:10.676 --> 20:12.209
The thing I really didn't appreciate

20:12.211 --> 20:14.845
was... was that game in the coffee shop.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.648
Not even showing me the
courtesy of recognizing me.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.783
Well, there were reasons.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.151
No, I don't care!

20:20.153 --> 20:23.988
I don't care what your reason is.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.891
That's petty, T.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.359
That's low.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.831
Can't you even ask me how I've been?

20:40.973 --> 20:42.606
How have you been?

20:43.053 --> 20:45.076
Oh!

20:45.078 --> 20:46.744
Great! Sooo good.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.079
Seriously.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.014
Because in the hours that
I've been locked up in here

20:50.016 --> 20:51.682
I've had the time to
think about my rights.

20:51.684 --> 20:55.853
Specifically that you have to
either charge me or let me go.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.355
But I say to myself,

20:58.357 --> 21:01.992
hell, let me give her
the benefit of the doubt.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.962
Give her a chance to
come up in here and say,

21:04.964 --> 21:07.865
Gabriel, my baby brother,

21:07.867 --> 21:11.268
I'm so sorry that I went psycho on you.

21:11.270 --> 21:16.107
I've let the whole wrongful
arrest thing go for Dad's sake.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.478
But you didn't.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.081
Because you can't, can you?

21:36.262 --> 21:38.429
Luke, I need you to do something.

21:42.235 --> 21:45.569
Hey, Gabriel. How you doing, man?

21:45.571 --> 21:46.670
Why?

21:46.672 --> 21:47.872
It's Luke Alvez.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.840
I work with your sister.
She must have mentioned me.

21:49.842 --> 21:50.841
No.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.209
Are you sure?

21:52.211 --> 21:53.444
Yeah, I'm positive.

21:53.446 --> 22:00.151
You are and always
will be a stupid jerk.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.419
That's what I said to that kid,

22:02.421 --> 22:03.654
Martin Gumbel, that little jackass

22:03.656 --> 22:04.922
who made fun of me in Germany.

22:04.924 --> 22:10.928
He responded by drawing
a swastika on my locker.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.164
So you told on him

22:13.166 --> 22:14.999
and then his friends beat you up.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.903
You always looked out for
me, even as a little kid.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.372
I never told you how
much that meant to me.

22:23.376 --> 22:27.211
Gabriel, you're my baby brother.

22:27.213 --> 22:31.382
I am sorry I went psycho on you.

22:31.384 --> 22:34.185
And I need you to stay.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.296
Well, if you mean it...

22:45.298 --> 22:48.399
Put some skin in the game.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.942
Ha ha! Ok.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.910
That means before I help you

22:59.912 --> 23:01.979
I get to ask you for anything I want.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.481
I know what it means.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.350
Good. 'Cause I want Dad.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.318
No.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.719
Yeah, no, I want him to be there

23:08.721 --> 23:11.055
when I explain that picture to you.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.890
This has nothing to do with him.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.392
I'm sorry, that's not for you to decide.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.596
You put skin in the game. Go get him.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.631
Ha!

23:30.009 --> 23:31.508
Dad...

23:31.510 --> 23:33.677
We might have a lead.

23:33.679 --> 23:36.547
But I need you to do something,

23:36.549 --> 23:40.084
and it's not gonna be easy.

23:42.021 --> 23:45.322
When I got to the
coffee shop this morning,

23:45.324 --> 23:48.225
a man sat down across from me.

23:48.227 --> 23:52.029
A man I didn't recognize.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.765
Dad...

23:54.767 --> 23:58.068
It wasn't Gabriel.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.787
So from what Spence and I dug up,
Scratch used his fake identity

24:05.789 --> 24:08.173
to buy a shibari rope from this couple.

24:08.173 --> 24:09.405
They own a batik sex shop.

24:09.405 --> 24:12.300
In addition to the rope, he also
made a very expensive purchase

24:12.300 --> 24:13.715
that was listed only as "other."

24:13.715 --> 24:15.153
Shop's probably closed by now.

24:15.153 --> 24:16.572
We do have their home address.

24:16.572 --> 24:19.141
We have to hurry.
Scratch likes mind games,

24:19.141 --> 24:20.954
and right now he's
putting Tara through hell.

24:27.469 --> 24:28.603
Do I have to do this?

24:32.368 --> 24:32.790
No.

24:32.790 --> 24:36.366
But we'll have a better chance
of finding your brother if I do.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.216
Then I'm ready.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.118
No, you're not.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.724
I've been trained for this, Dad.

24:45.732 --> 24:46.888
You haven't.

24:46.890 --> 24:48.390
So the best thing you can do in there

24:48.392 --> 24:50.025
is to not say anything.

24:50.027 --> 24:52.561
Ok?

24:52.563 --> 24:54.296
Ok.

24:56.567 --> 24:59.367
Oh, Dad. Hallelujah.

24:59.706 --> 25:04.506
Can you talk some sense
into my sister, please?

25:07.744 --> 25:09.211
Oh.

25:09.213 --> 25:11.813
Oh. Oh.

25:11.815 --> 25:14.816
Maybe we should call aunt
Thelma in while we're at it.

25:15.297 --> 25:17.752
Maybe she can turn her back on me, too.

25:17.754 --> 25:22.657
You asked for us both,
Gabriel. Here we are.

25:24.783 --> 25:25.527
What is this?

25:26.116 --> 25:28.363
I was 15 here.

25:29.666 --> 25:30.765
You were what?

25:30.767 --> 25:32.133
I was 18.

25:32.135 --> 25:34.069
What was going on at 18?

25:34.071 --> 25:35.470
I was at Dartmouth.

25:35.472 --> 25:38.640
Uh, I had to come home that spring

25:38.642 --> 25:40.075
for Mom's funeral.

25:40.077 --> 25:44.546
And how was I during that time?

25:45.749 --> 25:47.015
You didn't talk much,

25:47.017 --> 25:48.483
but I could tell that you were hurting.

25:48.485 --> 25:52.354
So, I convinced Dad to let me
have you over family weekend.

25:52.356 --> 25:55.657
He had two rules. What were they?

25:55.659 --> 25:58.960
I couldn't get you drunk.

25:58.962 --> 26:01.229
And, um...

26:05.990 --> 26:09.404
Go ahead, Dad.

26:10.201 --> 26:11.806
You remember.

26:12.431 --> 26:15.599
I made you promise to
take Gabriel to church.

26:16.599 --> 26:20.504
I wanted the two of you to
pray for your mother's soul.

26:22.341 --> 26:25.442
That was the most
boring pastor, ever, man.

26:25.444 --> 26:27.578
Can we please get breakfast now?

26:27.580 --> 26:29.513
Let me take a picture for Dad.

26:29.515 --> 26:31.849
Name a type of cheese.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.918
Swiss.

26:35.621 --> 26:38.522
I remember it now.

26:38.524 --> 26:41.926
But why is this so significant to you?

26:41.928 --> 26:43.961
It's the last time I felt normal.

26:47.321 --> 26:48.832
Isn't that right, Dad?

26:52.271 --> 26:53.404
Ok, Dad, let's go outside.

26:53.406 --> 26:55.172
No. No.

26:56.008 --> 26:58.475
You wanted my help.

26:58.477 --> 27:01.812
You want us to be a family again.

27:01.814 --> 27:04.882
Let's do 'em both.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.751
The 3 of us.

27:07.753 --> 27:09.587
Mom, Dad!

27:09.589 --> 27:10.854
Don't come in!

27:10.856 --> 27:14.658
Someone was at the
door, so I let them in.

27:14.660 --> 27:18.495
Honey, you know
we talked about this.

27:18.497 --> 27:20.898
You said it was ok if it was the police,

27:20.900 --> 27:22.633
and it's the FBI.

27:22.635 --> 27:25.569
FBI?! What's the FBI doing here?!

27:25.571 --> 27:28.072
I have no idea. I'm slipping.

27:28.074 --> 27:29.740
I'm slipping! Aah!

27:31.277 --> 27:34.044
Hannah, you know what?
We can take it from here.

27:34.046 --> 27:35.646
Ok. Just so you know,

27:35.648 --> 27:37.948
sometimes it takes him
a while to untie her.

27:46.692 --> 27:50.127
Can I offer you anything to drink?

27:50.129 --> 27:51.862
No, thank you.

27:51.864 --> 27:53.364
We're good.

27:53.366 --> 27:55.153
Yes, I made equipment for Carl Brubaker,

27:55.511 --> 27:58.212
we talked on the phone, but
we never met face to face.

27:58.266 --> 27:59.473
Do you have an address?

27:59.475 --> 28:01.508
Just a P.O. box. We needed to make sure

28:01.510 --> 28:03.911
they could handle a
delivery of that size.

28:03.913 --> 28:05.245
And what did you make for him?

28:05.247 --> 28:08.115
It was a vise connected
to a pressure plate,

28:08.117 --> 28:11.418
which was in turn built around a chair.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.887
If you moved the weight
off the pressure plate,

28:13.889 --> 28:15.856
the vise would squeeze.

28:15.858 --> 28:19.360
If you take the weight off,
how tightly would it squeeze?

28:19.362 --> 28:21.628
Tight enough to cut off blood flow.

28:21.630 --> 28:23.097
Or oxygen?

28:23.099 --> 28:26.000
Yes, or oxygen.

28:27.225 --> 28:29.371
What do you mean, it was the
last time you felt normal?

28:29.371 --> 28:33.974
Because I was a victim, of the
soft bigotry of low expectations.

28:33.976 --> 28:36.944
Come on, Gabriel. You
had a full ride to college

28:36.946 --> 28:38.412
and you didn't take it.

28:38.414 --> 28:39.947
What was it you said to me?

28:39.949 --> 28:42.316
"Oh, I don't know, T.
What if it's too hard?"

28:44.387 --> 28:46.887
Yeah, that's what I said.

28:46.889 --> 28:47.821
Isn't it?

28:47.823 --> 28:49.490
Do not look to him.

28:49.492 --> 28:52.359
He's not responsible for your choices.

28:52.361 --> 28:53.560
Choices?

28:53.562 --> 28:55.929
Oh, wow. That's a good one.

28:55.931 --> 28:58.565
That's... So funny.

28:58.567 --> 29:03.303
Uh, you ever hear of a brand
of wine called Leonte Chianti?

29:03.305 --> 29:04.338
No.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.406
Of course you haven't.

29:05.408 --> 29:06.640
That's because it's cheap.

29:06.642 --> 29:08.842
It's a step below Two-Buck Chuck.

29:08.844 --> 29:13.013
But, uh, it's perfect
for drowning your sorrows.

29:13.015 --> 29:14.648
Blaming alcohol now?

29:14.650 --> 29:16.150
No, not in the way you think.

29:16.152 --> 29:18.886
But if you or I ever
had a glass of Leonte,

29:18.888 --> 29:20.721
we'd probably have to fight

29:20.723 --> 29:22.623
our gag reflexes.

29:22.625 --> 29:27.027
But, um, let's just say
you were drinking to forget,

29:27.029 --> 29:31.398
I don't know, uh, how about the, uh...

29:31.400 --> 29:33.567
The death of your wife?

29:36.572 --> 29:39.406
It'd be perfect then.

29:41.444 --> 29:44.244
"This is my rifle, this is my gun!

29:44.246 --> 29:48.482
This one's for killing,
this one's for fun!"

29:48.484 --> 29:50.851
Yeah, that's what he'd say,

29:50.853 --> 29:53.887
as he marched around the house,

29:53.889 --> 29:56.723
loaded shotgun in one hand.

29:59.829 --> 30:05.466
After about 3 or 4 bottles I
gently coaxed it away from him.

30:07.803 --> 30:09.603
Is this true?

30:11.107 --> 30:13.807
I remember the wine.

30:19.815 --> 30:23.417
That's why you didn't go to Yale.

30:23.419 --> 30:26.019
Why wouldn't you tell me that, Gabriel?

30:29.125 --> 30:31.158
So why didn't I tell her?

30:33.596 --> 30:37.097
I ordered him not to.

30:37.099 --> 30:39.967
Your mother and I,

30:39.969 --> 30:41.702
you were our dream,

30:41.704 --> 30:46.306
and we couldn't let
anyone stand in the way

30:46.308 --> 30:48.142
of what you could be.

30:48.144 --> 30:50.677
Hence,

30:50.679 --> 30:53.780
the soft bigotry of low expectations.

30:55.151 --> 30:58.252
Not from society...

30:58.254 --> 31:01.021
From your own family.

31:07.821 --> 31:10.264
Now, you better go after him.

31:17.197 --> 31:19.733
Here's the thing about brainwashing.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.134
It's actually a myth.

31:22.210 --> 31:26.204
You go back to MKUltra and
the CIA dosing people with LSD

31:26.206 --> 31:29.104
and "the Manchurian
candidate," never worked.

31:29.344 --> 31:32.495
Scratch cracked the code with
his drugs and his patients

31:32.495 --> 31:33.679
with multiple personalities.

31:33.782 --> 31:36.544
That's true, but I keep going
back to the video that Garcia got.

31:36.859 --> 31:39.517
Now, this Desmond guy is
supposed to be super delicate.

31:39.521 --> 31:41.428
One wrong word and
he goes into a stupor.

31:41.428 --> 31:43.162
That's not what we're seeing.

31:43.607 --> 31:45.036
Desmond Holt is dug in.

31:45.036 --> 31:47.320
You can watch the real
Gabriel in here right now

31:47.320 --> 31:50.530
and Desmond's going to insist
that he's Tara's brother.

31:50.927 --> 31:53.174
I think the only way Scratch
could have gotten him to that point

31:53.174 --> 31:55.114
is if there was overlap somehow.

31:55.184 --> 31:59.069
Emotional overlap,
psychological overlap.

31:59.069 --> 32:02.387
If we can find that overlap, we
might be able to deprogram Desmond.

32:02.394 --> 32:03.767
All right. What do they share?

32:03.829 --> 32:04.996
Hatred.

32:05.225 --> 32:07.726
For the father figure in their lives.

32:07.781 --> 32:10.682
Desmond played Russian
roulette with his stepfather,

32:10.684 --> 32:13.251
and Gabriel...

32:13.253 --> 32:16.855
Well, yeah, it's not the
same thing, but it's close.

32:16.857 --> 32:18.323
So what else?

32:18.325 --> 32:20.158
When Mom died, they were all alone,

32:20.160 --> 32:24.196
and he needed a protector.

32:24.198 --> 32:26.631
"Luke can't save you now."
That's what Scratch said.

32:26.633 --> 32:28.834
I mean, we knew Scratch
would be baiting us.

32:28.836 --> 32:30.502
That name, it should have copied over.

32:30.504 --> 32:33.538
When I stopped him at the elevator,
he didn't even know who I was.

32:33.540 --> 32:35.841
Are there any other Lukes in his life?

32:35.843 --> 32:38.343
Not that I can...

32:42.416 --> 32:43.582
You gotta be kidding me.

32:43.584 --> 32:44.783
What do you see?

32:44.785 --> 32:48.320
This whole time I thought
Luke and these pictures

32:48.322 --> 32:49.554
were separate clues.

32:49.556 --> 32:51.523
They're not. They're the same clue.

32:51.525 --> 32:54.693
This is the pattern that
Scratch wanted us to see.

32:54.695 --> 32:58.463
Luke, 15, 11, 32.

32:58.465 --> 33:01.199
The Gospel of Luke, chapter 15,

33:01.201 --> 33:04.336
verses 11 through 32.

33:09.042 --> 33:11.376
I know exactly what this is.

33:13.981 --> 33:17.249
That morning, after we
got back from church,

33:17.251 --> 33:19.718
you complained about how boring it was.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.353
And then I took this.

33:21.355 --> 33:22.888
Swiss.

33:22.890 --> 33:24.923
You know the part of church I liked?

33:24.925 --> 33:26.291
The Bible story.

33:26.293 --> 33:29.795
You know, the one about the
older sibling who griped to Dad

33:29.797 --> 33:32.697
because the younger
brother was such a screw-up.

33:32.699 --> 33:34.332
Whew! Boy, could I relate.

33:34.334 --> 33:36.968
But that wasn't the end, was it?

33:36.970 --> 33:40.205
The parable of the prodigal
son from the Gospel of Luke.

33:40.207 --> 33:42.207
You remember it?

33:43.811 --> 33:45.277
I never forgot.

33:45.279 --> 33:47.579
That's why you kept
this photo for 20 years.

33:47.581 --> 33:50.449
Because you look at
the two of us on paper

33:50.451 --> 33:52.951
and it's easy to make assumptions...

33:52.953 --> 33:56.455
I am the successful one. I'm
the one who got the degree,

33:56.457 --> 33:59.257
the career that Dad
could brag about, but...

33:59.259 --> 34:01.059
I also never looked back.

34:01.061 --> 34:04.196
And when you opted out of college,

34:04.198 --> 34:06.164
I never thought it was
because you were the one

34:06.166 --> 34:09.900
who had to stay home
and do the hard work.

34:09.902 --> 34:14.072
Like the older son in that parable.

34:14.074 --> 34:18.677
Gabriel, you're not...
You're not the prodigal.

34:18.679 --> 34:19.945
I am.

34:26.353 --> 34:29.187
Was it scary?

34:29.188 --> 34:31.356
Mom gone,

34:31.358 --> 34:34.326
just you and your stepdad and that gun?

34:36.697 --> 34:37.795
Yeah.

34:37.797 --> 34:41.366
I am so sorry that
happened to you, Desmond.

34:43.570 --> 34:44.703
What?

34:44.705 --> 34:46.338
So sorry.

34:54.815 --> 34:57.282
No.

35:02.089 --> 35:05.724
Look at me. Stay with
me, Desmond. Stay with me.

35:05.726 --> 35:07.325
Please, stay with me.

35:09.563 --> 35:11.696
Desmond.

35:11.698 --> 35:13.632
My name is Tara Lewis.

35:13.634 --> 35:16.801
Yeah. Yeah.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.548
I know.

35:29.550 --> 35:30.582
I'm sorry.

35:30.584 --> 35:32.484
I'm sorry.

35:32.486 --> 35:34.386
I did things. I did them.

35:34.388 --> 35:36.354
Uh, you Tara?

35:36.356 --> 35:39.157
I did things 'cause he told me to.

35:39.159 --> 35:41.493
So, that's why I did it.

35:41.495 --> 35:43.762
What about Gabriel?

35:43.764 --> 35:45.964
Did you see Gabriel?

35:45.966 --> 35:49.634
Yeah, I saw him.

35:49.636 --> 35:50.635
He...

35:50.637 --> 35:52.771
Is... is he alive?

35:52.773 --> 35:55.473
Mm-hmm.

35:56.810 --> 35:58.443
I saw him.

35:58.445 --> 35:59.844
We were all in a warehouse.

35:59.846 --> 36:03.448
Um, the address is 22...

36:03.450 --> 36:07.185
23 Seventh street.

36:07.187 --> 36:10.088
He made me memorize it

36:10.090 --> 36:11.289
so I could drive back,

36:11.291 --> 36:14.426
'cause he needed me to
get something for him.

36:14.428 --> 36:17.295
It was important and he needed it.

36:17.297 --> 36:20.398
Ok, Desmond, listen, I have to go,

36:20.400 --> 36:22.400
but there are people here
who will take care of you.

36:22.402 --> 36:23.935
No! No.

36:23.937 --> 36:27.505
He gave me explicit
instructions where to find it.

36:27.507 --> 36:30.175
The spare key for the house,

36:30.177 --> 36:32.711
underneath the gnome.

36:36.383 --> 36:41.953
Your picture and Gabriel's
picture on the wall...

36:41.955 --> 36:44.990
And I think your mom.

36:46.326 --> 36:47.993
My father's house?

36:49.296 --> 36:51.363
He told me to get him a box,

36:51.365 --> 36:53.098
so I got it for him.

36:53.100 --> 36:56.601
When I gave him the box, he said...

36:56.603 --> 36:59.971
Maybe this is for killing and for fun.

36:59.973 --> 37:00.939
And for fun.

37:00.941 --> 37:02.674
Killing... Killing...

37:03.810 --> 37:06.111
And for fun, and for
fun, and for fun....

37:11.018 --> 37:15.086
He's gonna kill Gabriel
with my father's gun.

37:18.330 --> 37:19.696
I'll coordinate from here.

37:19.698 --> 37:21.064
GW emergency's on alert.

37:21.066 --> 37:24.129
The director wants a report if
you catch Scratch dead or alive.

37:24.129 --> 37:25.352
Will do.

37:28.373 --> 37:30.810
It's something bad, isn't it?

37:30.810 --> 37:31.972
Something you're not telling me.

37:32.149 --> 37:33.334
Dad, I have to go.

37:33.816 --> 37:36.847
Tara Elizabeth...

37:37.449 --> 37:41.318
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

37:41.320 --> 37:44.087
I can take it.

37:44.089 --> 37:46.156
Because, uh...

37:46.158 --> 37:47.624
It's all my fault.

37:51.066 --> 37:53.730
This is no one's fault.

38:05.944 --> 38:08.012
Thank you.

38:13.929 --> 38:15.570
I don't know about the rest of you,

38:15.570 --> 38:19.274
but I'm getting tired of losing
to this rat-faced son of a bitch.

38:19.778 --> 38:22.410
He's not gonna take anyone else
away from us, not on my watch.

38:22.410 --> 38:23.281
Am I clear?

38:23.402 --> 38:23.989
Hoo-ah.

38:25.724 --> 38:27.498
Let's go to work.

38:56.127 --> 38:57.126
Clear!

38:57.128 --> 38:59.962
Wait, hold up.

39:00.763 --> 39:01.955
That doesn't belong.

39:02.026 --> 39:03.625
Lewis, Alvez, second floor.

39:03.627 --> 39:06.195
Reid, JJ, open that up,
but don't disable anything

39:06.197 --> 39:08.430
until you get my go-ahead.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.620
Gabriel?

39:31.622 --> 39:32.788
You're gonna be ok.

39:32.790 --> 39:34.490
All right?

39:34.492 --> 39:36.058
JJ, we found him. What
do you have on your end?

39:36.060 --> 39:38.794
We found a power source.
If we cut the right wire,

39:38.796 --> 39:41.530
it should shut down the vise.

39:53.577 --> 39:55.477
No. No, no, no, no, no.

39:55.479 --> 39:56.578
Don't look at that. Look at me.

39:56.580 --> 39:59.515
Keep your eyes on me.
Right here. Right here.

39:59.517 --> 40:01.884
This rope is heavy.

40:01.886 --> 40:04.586
Just removing it will shift
the weight differential

40:04.588 --> 40:05.921
and fire the gun.

40:05.923 --> 40:07.322
JJ, what have you got?

40:08.592 --> 40:11.927
We may have something. Hang on.

40:11.929 --> 40:13.328
We're gonna get out out of this, ok?

40:13.330 --> 40:14.763
We're gonna find a way.

40:14.765 --> 40:17.399
No, no. Don't move.
Don't move. Stop. Stop!

40:17.401 --> 40:20.035
These aren't fuses,
they're shotgun shells.

40:20.037 --> 40:21.770
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move, don't move.

40:21.772 --> 40:24.606
Stop. Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop. Stop.

40:27.811 --> 40:28.844
It's engaging!

40:28.846 --> 40:30.779
No, no, no, hold it! Stop!

40:33.150 --> 40:35.083
It's a decoy. The shotgun isn't loaded.

40:35.085 --> 40:37.286
Ohh...

40:37.288 --> 40:38.520
Ok.

40:42.159 --> 40:43.125
Wait a minute.

40:43.127 --> 40:44.927
Why would Scratch stage this?

40:44.929 --> 40:47.095
It's not in his profile,

40:47.097 --> 40:49.898
unless he's leading
us into a bigger trap.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.167
Reid, JJ, look for another trigger.

40:57.107 --> 41:01.877
Reid, what is Exodus,
chapter 8, verse 24?

41:01.879 --> 41:03.078
It's one of the plagues of Moses.

41:03.080 --> 41:06.014
"And the Lord did this.
Dense swarms of flies

41:06.016 --> 41:08.083
"poured into Pharaoh's
palace. Throughout Egypt

41:08.085 --> 41:10.886
the land was ruined by the flies."

41:14.625 --> 41:16.191
It's above us!

41:16.193 --> 41:18.026
There's a redundance switch
somewhere. It's going off.

41:18.028 --> 41:20.028
We can interrupt it if we
bypass the correct fuse.

41:20.030 --> 41:21.363
Get this off me.

41:21.365 --> 41:22.698
I believe...

41:22.700 --> 41:25.133
All right, this will only delay
the trigger for a few seconds.

41:25.135 --> 41:27.869
All right, go, go, go, go
go! Get him off of there!

41:27.871 --> 41:30.239
Go! Go, go, go!

41:41.885 --> 41:44.253
Ohh...

41:45.456 --> 41:48.056
Is everyone ok? Is anyone hurt?

41:48.058 --> 41:50.025
Good.

41:50.027 --> 41:52.060
Hey, T.

42:16.754 --> 42:17.919
Gabriel.

42:20.624 --> 42:22.791
Dad.

42:22.793 --> 42:25.927
"The father said,
you are always with me",

42:25.929 --> 42:28.697
"and everything I have is yours.

42:28.699 --> 42:32.000
"But we had to celebrate and be glad,

42:32.002 --> 42:35.937
"because this brother of yours
was dead and is alive again.

42:35.939 --> 42:39.675
He was lost and is found."

42:39.677 --> 42:41.579
The Gospel of Luke.
