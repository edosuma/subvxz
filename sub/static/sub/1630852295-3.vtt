00:34.001 --> 00:35.021
Good morning, beauties.

00:35.023 --> 00:38.021
It's time for the sacred
ritual of breakfast.

00:38.023 --> 00:40.021
The singing of the teakettle.

00:42.002 --> 00:43.020
The sizzling
of the cake griddle.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.017
I won't forget you,
my cock-a-doodles.

00:47.019 --> 00:50.008
What else would you do
on this fine morning?

00:52.001 --> 00:53.008
Good morning,
moon face!

00:53.010 --> 00:54.017
I wanna feel fire!

00:57.004 --> 00:58.011
Sure, in a minute!

00:59.018 --> 01:01.023
-Uhh, Oscar?

01:02.001 --> 01:05.004
The chef's magic wand --
the spatula!

01:05.006 --> 01:07.010
Ahh, Oscar!

01:07.012 --> 01:10.007
Want a free ride?

01:10.009 --> 01:14.002
Oscar, you told me
your dance fever was cured.

01:19.009 --> 01:22.007
Destination?
My tum-tum.

01:22.009 --> 01:24.001
Yum, yum.

01:24.003 --> 01:25.019
Oscar!
Wake up!

01:25.021 --> 01:28.006
You're perfect
for a fresh OJ-fall.

01:34.002 --> 01:36.012
Aah! Spittle-fall!

01:36.014 --> 01:37.016
Pbht!

01:37.018 --> 01:40.005
That's it!
Sorry, old friend.

01:40.007 --> 01:41.015
Ah-choo!

01:41.017 --> 01:42.016
I'm up!

01:42.018 --> 01:44.016
Oh,
good morning, Oscar!

01:44.018 --> 01:46.012
Did you have
the dream again?

01:46.014 --> 01:49.003
Mm-hmm! I think it's time
to try it for real.

01:49.005 --> 01:51.009
Ah the sacred ritual of --

01:51.011 --> 01:52.012
Aah!

01:52.014 --> 01:54.012
The singing of -- Aah!

01:54.014 --> 01:56.002
The sizzling
of the cake griddle.

01:56.004 --> 01:58.005
I won't forget you,
my cock-a-doodles.

01:58.007 --> 01:59.006
Aah!

01:59.008 --> 02:01.000
Hey, Osca-- Oh!

02:01.002 --> 02:02.012
You had the dream
again, huh?

02:02.014 --> 02:05.009
I just want to do it once
in real life while I'm awake.

02:05.011 --> 02:07.014
Is that fool's folly?

02:07.016 --> 02:09.001
Am I fool?

02:09.003 --> 02:11.009
Oscar, you can't perform
an elaborate celebration

02:11.011 --> 02:14.001
of food and dance with a hot
plate in this little kitchen!

02:14.003 --> 02:16.017
It's like trying to compose
an opera with a kazoo.

02:16.019 --> 02:18.002
Wait. In my dream,

02:18.004 --> 02:20.019
I'm always in
the monsters' kitchen.
Perfect!

02:20.021 --> 02:22.023
I bet they'll let us borrow
their kitchen for a little.

02:23.001 --> 02:25.018
♪ The monsters' kitchen
is what I'm missin' ♪

02:25.020 --> 02:28.019
♪ I got this itchin',
and I'm sure wishin' ♪

02:28.021 --> 02:31.007
Oh! Perfect.
They're not even using it.

02:32.023 --> 02:34.006
Hi, guys!

02:34.008 --> 02:35.015
Can we use your kitchen?

02:35.017 --> 02:38.002
Fine by me!
We're goin' pine needle skiin'.

02:38.004 --> 02:39.006
Just check with Melvin.

02:39.008 --> 02:41.004
Okie dokie.
Break a leg!

02:42.015 --> 02:43.018
Oh! Sorry.

02:43.020 --> 02:45.009
That means "good luck."

02:45.011 --> 02:48.020
Only in the arts,
Hedgehog! Geez!

02:48.022 --> 02:52.002
In athletics, "break a leg"
just means what it says.

02:52.004 --> 02:53.008
Oh, crabapples!

02:53.010 --> 02:55.005
Sorry.

02:55.007 --> 02:57.006
Uhm...have fun
out there, guys!

02:57.008 --> 02:59.004
Uh-huh.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.016
Melvin?

03:07.006 --> 03:08.018
Hey, guys!
Good to see you.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.007
Can I use your
kitchen today?

03:10.009 --> 03:13.011
I'd like to make
breakfast.

03:13.013 --> 03:15.010
I just cleaned it.

03:15.012 --> 03:17.007
We'll clean it up after.

03:17.009 --> 03:19.000
Come here.

03:20.003 --> 03:22.011
You see that sheen
on the counters?

03:22.013 --> 03:24.007
You see that grout?

03:24.009 --> 03:25.015
Sheeny!

03:25.017 --> 03:26.021
It looks great, Melvin --

03:29.022 --> 03:31.017
You're sure you can
get it this clean?

03:31.019 --> 03:33.021
If you don't, I'll have
to re-clean it again.

03:33.023 --> 03:37.002
Which would mean my kitchen
took three showers in one day.

03:37.004 --> 03:38.003
Two showers, fine.

03:38.005 --> 03:40.014
But three?
That's just nuts!

03:40.016 --> 03:43.015
Melvin, you wouldn't have to
re-clean our clean.

03:43.017 --> 03:45.023
We're great cleaners.
Right, Oscar?

03:48.007 --> 03:50.015
What if we cleaned something
as, like, a test clean,

03:50.017 --> 03:51.018
to show you
that we can do it?

03:51.020 --> 03:54.011
Then can we use
your kitchen?

03:54.013 --> 03:55.015
Mm, fine.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.022
Mwah!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.020
Get that filthy booger hand
off me, please.

04:00.003 --> 04:02.011
Wait. Are we cleaning
the motorcycle, too?

04:02.013 --> 04:04.006
No.
That's Howard's.

04:06.015 --> 04:07.017
You're fun.

04:07.019 --> 04:09.007
Okay. All done.

04:09.009 --> 04:12.003
Hmm. Looks good.
But...

04:12.005 --> 04:14.022
my sidecar was already
perfectly clean.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.009
I now realize this wasn't
a good test item.

04:19.003 --> 04:20.013
What do I do here?

04:20.015 --> 04:22.003
Do I let my dream go?

04:22.005 --> 04:24.014
Do you want
to let your dream go?

04:24.016 --> 04:26.008
I don't want
to let my dream go.

04:26.010 --> 04:27.023
I really don't.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.012
We're doing this breakfast.

04:29.014 --> 04:32.011
Melvin, listen.

04:32.013 --> 04:35.006
We'll clean the dirtiest place
you can think of.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.004
Hmm. Lemme muse on it.

04:47.004 --> 04:48.021
Huh?

04:48.023 --> 04:50.010
Ah-ah-ugh!

04:50.012 --> 04:52.015
Ahhhhhh!

04:52.017 --> 04:53.017
Ugh!

04:53.019 --> 04:54.017
Ohh. Oww.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.012
Ooh. Ah. Ow. It hurts!

04:56.014 --> 04:58.003
I think I broke my leg!

04:58.005 --> 05:00.004
The spell!

05:00.006 --> 05:01.023
Hedgehog!

05:02.001 --> 05:04.010
Don't move.
I'm gonna go get help!

05:05.019 --> 05:07.013
Ahhh!

05:07.015 --> 05:08.016
Ugh!

05:08.018 --> 05:10.010
Hedgehog!

05:19.004 --> 05:20.009
Ski Patrol!

05:20.011 --> 05:23.007
I heard two people
yell "Hedgehog!"

05:23.009 --> 05:25.016
What is that, a new swear?

05:25.018 --> 05:26.019
No.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.001
Aww.

05:28.003 --> 05:29.010
Hedgehog is a camper.

05:29.012 --> 05:30.021
And a baby witch.

05:30.023 --> 05:33.005
And the source of all
these accidents!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.016
Can you describe
how you broke your leg

05:38.018 --> 05:39.023
for our report?

05:40.001 --> 05:41.022
Well --
Wait! I can show you!

05:42.000 --> 05:43.023
She got her ski caught
in the chair-lift like this.

05:44.001 --> 05:45.013
Oh, ohh!

05:45.015 --> 05:46.012
Ugh!

05:47.023 --> 05:50.022
Ahh, Hedgehog!

05:51.000 --> 05:52.006
Margot!
I'll help you!

05:52.008 --> 05:53.014
Oh! Ahh!

05:57.011 --> 05:59.008
We're four for four.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.012
Nobody move.

06:00.014 --> 06:02.005
Geez, what's gotten
into you guys?

06:02.007 --> 06:04.000
Or, maybe, what <i>hasn't</i>
gotten into you?

06:04.002 --> 06:06.009
Did you guys forget
to eat breakfast or something?

06:06.011 --> 06:08.022
Oh!

06:09.000 --> 06:10.017
We totally forgot!

06:10.019 --> 06:12.006
Melvin was cleaning the kitchen,

06:12.008 --> 06:14.002
and he says we breathe
too hard on the counters.

06:14.004 --> 06:15.020
We were gonna eat after
but we just wanted

06:15.022 --> 06:17.007
to get to the slopes.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.015
Well,
<i>that's</i> <i>your problem.</i>

06:18.017 --> 06:21.007
For some, breakfast
is a sacred ritual.

06:21.009 --> 06:24.018
For others, it is the most
important meal of the day.

06:26.009 --> 06:29.002
Everyone, get on.
We'll take you home.

06:30.007 --> 06:32.014
What are you looking at,
Howard?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.018
Uh...

06:35.001 --> 06:36.003
Come on, Howard.

06:36.005 --> 06:37.017
Uh...

06:37.019 --> 06:38.020
No, Howard!

06:38.022 --> 06:40.002
I'm just gonna...

06:40.004 --> 06:41.009
kick that soccer ball.

06:41.011 --> 06:42.014
No, Howard!

06:42.016 --> 06:44.002
Howard,
can you seriously not?

06:44.004 --> 06:46.009
-No, Howard!
-Howard!
-No! Howard!

06:48.021 --> 06:50.015
Ugh!

06:51.012 --> 06:53.010
Melvin, no.
That's the whole point.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.016
You can't wash a cast-iron pan
with soap.

06:55.018 --> 06:56.023
You just can't!

06:57.001 --> 06:58.012
You've asked to clean
our place before.

06:58.014 --> 07:00.020
Now you're trying to get
the kids in on it?

07:00.022 --> 07:02.009
It's disgraceful.

07:02.011 --> 07:04.008
It's not for me.
It's for them.

07:04.010 --> 07:06.012
They have to prove
themselves.

07:06.014 --> 07:10.002
Melvin, no one needs
to prove anything to anyone.

07:10.004 --> 07:11.018
We think you're great, okay?

07:11.020 --> 07:12.021
You're already pure.

07:12.023 --> 07:14.020
You're already perfect.

07:14.022 --> 07:17.014
Get your dirty pan hand
off me. Ugh!

07:17.016 --> 07:20.013
Wow, Mel, we didn't know
you had such a reputation.

07:20.015 --> 07:21.023
Yeah, ya clean fiend.

07:22.001 --> 07:23.022
What else don't we know
about you?

07:26.012 --> 07:28.004
Ahh, that guy.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.018
Okay. Hedgehog,
you say you can clean.

07:32.020 --> 07:34.008
You wouldn't have gone
through all this trouble

07:34.010 --> 07:35.016
had you been lying.

07:35.018 --> 07:38.016
My compromise is,
Oscar makes breakfast,

07:38.018 --> 07:40.017
Hedgehog cleans
as he goes.

07:40.019 --> 07:42.011
Totally.
We can do that.

07:42.013 --> 07:43.018
Oh, boy,
I don't wanna watch.

07:43.020 --> 07:45.013
Just call me
when it's over.

07:49.019 --> 07:51.000
Oscar?

07:51.002 --> 07:52.007
Okay.

07:52.009 --> 07:53.013
This is how it starts.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.016
Ah, the sacred ritual
of breakfast.

07:55.018 --> 07:57.003
The singing of the --

07:57.005 --> 07:58.012
Whoops!

07:58.014 --> 07:59.013
Ohh.

07:59.015 --> 08:00.013
Don't worry, Oscar.

08:00.015 --> 08:02.004
You'll cook,
and I'll clean.

08:02.006 --> 08:03.013
Thanks, Hedgehog.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.017
Want a free ride?

08:07.015 --> 08:08.013
Forget it.

08:08.015 --> 08:10.009
It's not the kitchen.
It's me.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.020
I'm just not the chef
of my dreams.

08:12.022 --> 08:13.023
Well, why not?

08:14.001 --> 08:15.008
I mean,
what's the difference

08:15.010 --> 08:16.020
between the dream you
and the awake you?

08:16.022 --> 08:18.017
About 20 pounds
of lean muscle,

08:18.019 --> 08:21.005
legs for days,
softer hair.

08:21.007 --> 08:22.018
Well, why don't you go
into your dreams

08:22.020 --> 08:24.001
and find out
what's missing?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.017
I'll just do
the "boop boop" spell.

08:25.019 --> 08:28.014
Hedgehog, I don't speak
elitist witch terminology.

08:28.016 --> 08:30.002
It's a sleep spell.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.006
Ooh.

08:31.008 --> 08:32.018
Ready?

08:32.020 --> 08:34.006
Whisper in your ear.

08:34.008 --> 08:35.018
Now fold them right here.

08:35.020 --> 08:37.003
Now boop you on the nose.

08:38.008 --> 08:40.007
Sleep until I boop you
on the toes.

08:40.009 --> 08:42.005
Nice try, but I'm never
gonna fall asl--

08:45.000 --> 08:47.014
It's time for the sacred
ritual of breakfast.

08:47.016 --> 08:49.013
The singing of the teakettle.

08:49.015 --> 08:51.013
The sizzling of
the cake griddle.
I'm in my dream!

08:51.015 --> 08:52.021
Hedgehog's spell worked.

08:52.023 --> 08:56.005
There's me looking rugged
and outdoorsy, as usual.

08:56.007 --> 08:57.012
And there's Hedgehog
in the cabinet,

08:57.014 --> 08:58.019
cheering me on, as usual.

08:58.021 --> 09:00.015
I love you!

09:00.017 --> 09:02.001
There's the dream bowl,

09:02.003 --> 09:04.018
and the dream pan
who loves fire dearly.

09:04.020 --> 09:07.002
Huh?
What am I looking at?

09:08.011 --> 09:10.004
Someone's there.

09:13.023 --> 09:16.011
Oh. Have you guys been there
the whole time?

09:16.013 --> 09:17.023
Uh-huh.

09:18.001 --> 09:19.004
That explains it!

09:19.006 --> 09:21.006
Dream me is cooking for a group.

09:21.008 --> 09:22.011
Five by my count.

09:22.013 --> 09:23.012
I've figured it out!

09:23.014 --> 09:25.006
Boop me, Hedgehog! Boop me!

09:27.010 --> 09:28.014
Boop.

09:28.016 --> 09:29.018
So, how was it?

09:29.020 --> 09:31.007
Five droopy,
hungry guests!

09:31.009 --> 09:32.008
Uh, what?

09:32.010 --> 09:33.011
Oh, sorry.

09:33.013 --> 09:34.023
I'm making breakfast
for a group of five.

09:35.001 --> 09:36.002
That's what's missing.

09:36.004 --> 09:38.000
Hmm. But it's almost
dinnertime.

09:38.002 --> 09:39.018
Where are we gonna find
five people...

09:39.020 --> 09:41.008
...that want breakfast?

09:44.010 --> 09:46.012
Hedgehog,
your curse...

09:46.014 --> 09:48.006
Oh, no!

09:48.008 --> 09:50.007
...had nothing to do
with this, so don't worry!

09:50.009 --> 09:51.012
We couldn't focus because

09:51.014 --> 09:52.022
we didn't have breakfast
this morning.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.007
We're starving!

09:54.009 --> 09:57.002
Breakfast a la Oscar,
coming right up!

10:03.021 --> 10:05.018
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!
Go, Oscar!

10:20.006 --> 10:21.010
Choo-choo!

10:21.012 --> 10:23.007
The croissant express
comin' through!

10:25.007 --> 10:26.017
Hooo!

10:28.006 --> 10:29.003
Bon appétit.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.005
-Whoo!
-We're starving!

10:30.007 --> 10:31.023
You all done?
How's my kitchen?

10:32.001 --> 10:34.001
Oh, no!
I was so impressed with Oscar

10:34.003 --> 10:35.008
that I forgot to clean up!

10:41.004 --> 10:43.000
I messed it up.

10:43.002 --> 10:45.001
Hold on.
Full disclosure --

10:45.003 --> 10:47.012
today has been
full of disgusting things.

10:47.014 --> 10:50.019
I've been dying to use a mop
since that grease den.

10:53.007 --> 10:55.015
Ah the sacred ritual
of cleaning.

10:55.017 --> 10:57.015
The splashing of the wet mop.

10:57.017 --> 10:59.015
The swooshing
of the sponge skate.

10:59.017 --> 11:01.008
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
What else would you do

11:01.010 --> 11:03.020
on this fine evening
but cleaning?

11:18.004 --> 11:20.016
Get that filthy booger hand
off me, please.
