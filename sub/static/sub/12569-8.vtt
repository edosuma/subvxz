WEBVTT

00:04.589 --> 00:06.424
- Jessie! - Guess who's
- In the park?

00:06.549 --> 00:07.670
- Chris Bosh,
- NBA All-Star?

00:07.717 --> 00:09.510
- No, Chris Bosh,
- NBA...

00:09.635 --> 00:12.054
Wait, how did you know?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.764
He's seven feet tall

00:13.765 --> 00:15.349
and he's standing

00:12.179 --> 00:15.349
right over there.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.514
- It's either him - or a really
- Well-dressed tree.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.605
The Heat are in town

00:20.606 --> 00:21.689
to play the Knicks.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.337
I hate the Heat.

00:23.338 --> 00:24.859
They think

00:21.814 --> 00:24.859
they're so good

00:24.984 --> 00:26.132
just because they

00:26.133 --> 00:27.278
won the championship.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.280
- Well, I happen
- to know Chris.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.532
But I guess you don't

00:31.533 --> 00:33.659
want me to introduce

00:29.405 --> 00:33.659
you since you hate the Heat.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.160
- Ooh, ooh.
- I wanna meet Chris.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.079
- Please, please,
- please, please, please?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.205
Okay, come on.

00:38.957 --> 00:41.709
Here you go, Jason.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.399
So, Chris,

00:43.400 --> 00:44.963
how the heck are ya?

00:41.834 --> 00:44.963
It's been a while.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.589
Do I know you?

00:47.799 --> 00:49.300
- Well, this isn't
- awkward at all.

00:50.676 --> 00:51.803
Jessie Prescott.

00:51.928 --> 00:53.649
- When you went to
- Lincoln High in Dallas,

00:53.763 --> 00:55.431
- Your team played
- our hometown school.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.766
Remember?

00:56.891 --> 00:58.517
- Maybe this
- will help.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.269
- (CHEERING) - Bosh, Bosh,
- Oh, my gosh,

01:00.394 --> 01:02.104
- Our team's gonna
- kick your tosh!

01:02.229 --> 01:03.230
That was you?

01:04.105 --> 01:05.566
- That was the
- worst chant ever.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.903
And what is a tosh?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.676
Well, I meant tush,

01:10.677 --> 01:12.323
but it's hard to find

01:09.028 --> 01:12.323
words that rhyme with Bosh.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.950
- How about - squash?
- Posh?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.284
- Nosh?
- Slosh?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.119
I was nine.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.246
And these little

01:19.247 --> 01:21.248
know-it-alls are

01:17.244 --> 01:21.248
Luke, Emma, Ravi and Zuri.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.750
Don't you have any

01:22.751 --> 01:24.126
friends your own age?

01:25.336 --> 01:26.504
I'm their nanny.

01:26.505 --> 01:27.672
And, no.

01:29.966 --> 01:31.759
- Well, nice to
- meet you guys.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.803
You know, my Knicks

01:33.804 --> 01:35.721
are going to kick

01:31.884 --> 01:35.721
your butt tonight.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.599
- Do you really
- believe that?

01:38.724 --> 01:40.518
- (SCOFFS)
- Absolutely...

01:40.643 --> 01:41.644
Not.

01:43.896 --> 01:44.981
(YELLING)

01:44.982 --> 01:46.065
Nice to meet you, Chris.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.233
I know I'm tall,

01:47.234 --> 01:48.275
but I can hear you.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.798
I know. But Jessie

01:49.799 --> 01:51.195
only lets me

01:48.400 --> 01:51.195
yell in the park.

01:53.698 --> 01:54.907
You know, Chris,

01:55.033 --> 01:56.468
- I have - some advice
- For the Heat

01:56.492 --> 01:57.761
- That I think will
- really help this season.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.786
Okay.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.331
- Pink piping on your
- basketball costumes.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.960
- Oh, okay,
- I'll tell Coach.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.922
So, Mr. Bosh,

02:10.048 --> 02:11.174
basketball must

02:11.175 --> 02:12.299
be easy for a man

02:12.424 --> 02:13.864
as vertically

02:13.865 --> 02:15.302
gifted as yourself.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.013
Well, you'd think.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.722
But the other teams

02:18.723 --> 02:20.307
have tall guys who

02:17.137 --> 02:20.307
are really good too.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.893
- Hmm.
- Complain much?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.331
- So, Chris, it must be
- exciting being a pro,

02:26.355 --> 02:27.356
Traveling all

02:27.357 --> 02:28.357
over the country.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.734
Yeah, it's great.

02:29.735 --> 02:30.985
Except, I can

02:28.482 --> 02:30.985
never get any

02:31.110 --> 02:32.132
sleep sharing

02:32.133 --> 02:33.153
a hotel room

02:31.110 --> 02:33.153
with LeBron.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.489
Oh, does he keep you

02:34.490 --> 02:35.698
up partying? (CHUCKLES)

02:35.823 --> 02:37.909
No, singing in the shower.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.994
LeBron has a serious

02:35.823 --> 02:39.994
case of Bieber fever.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.351
Chris, why don't you come

02:43.352 --> 02:44.456
stay at our penthouse?

02:44.582 --> 02:45.604
We have plenty

02:45.605 --> 02:46.625
of room.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.294
Plus, I'd like to make

02:48.295 --> 02:49.837
it up to you for all

02:46.751 --> 02:49.837
that painful taunting.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.798
It was painful, right?

02:53.591 --> 02:54.592
Extremely.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.449
But your taunting

02:57.450 --> 02:58.596
made me work harder,

02:58.721 --> 03:00.056
- and helped me
- make the NBA.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.370
And yet you never

03:01.371 --> 03:02.558
sent me a thank you car.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.226
You mean card?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.562
Oh, no, you're

03:05.563 --> 03:06.771
in the NBA.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.771
I meant car.

where's my cut?

- money off this.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.017
Well, you should.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.748
If you market

04:27.749 --> 04:29.353
Kitty Couture right,

04:26.142 --> 04:29.353
it can be a gold mine.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.813
It's not about money.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.315
Kitty Couture's mission

04:32.316 --> 04:33.691
is to inform and educate.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.026
If I can save

04:35.027 --> 04:36.235
one young girl

04:33.816 --> 04:36.235
from wearing culottes...

04:37.695 --> 04:39.050
Sorry, I just

04:39.051 --> 04:40.405
care too much.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.117
- Is Emma crying
- over culottes again?

04:45.244 --> 04:46.705
They're baggy shorts.

04:46.706 --> 04:48.164
The skort's ugly stepsister.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.063
Hey, can I clean this?

04:51.064 --> 04:52.168
Are these diamonds

04:49.957 --> 04:52.168
color-safe?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.004
Jessie,

04:55.005 --> 04:56.380
that's Arturo Vitalli's

04:53.627 --> 04:56.380
prototype dress

04:56.505 --> 04:57.840
- that he sent
- to Kitty Couture.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.009
I'm reviewing it

04:59.010 --> 05:00.051
for next week's vlog.

05:00.176 --> 05:01.219
Now,

05:01.220 --> 05:02.261
put it down,

05:00.176 --> 05:02.261
greasy hands.

05:03.929 --> 05:04.930
That's fair.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.059
I can't believe you got

05:08.060 --> 05:09.393
sent a one-of-a-kind,

05:06.724 --> 05:09.393
designer dress.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.125
All I got sent was

05:11.126 --> 05:12.730
a card from my dentist

05:09.518 --> 05:12.730
saying my night-guard is in.

(PHONE BEEPS)

05:15.774 --> 05:17.109
(GASPS) Ooh.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.443
I just got my reminder

05:15.774 --> 05:18.443
that Kitty Couture

05:18.569 --> 05:20.008
is invited to

05:20.009 --> 05:21.446
the New York Teen

05:18.569 --> 05:21.446
Fashion Gala tonight.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.991
Well, I'm getting

05:22.992 --> 05:24.408
a free toothbrush.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.408
So, neener-neener.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.995
Oh, but, I can't go.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.789
Kitty Couture

05:29.790 --> 05:31.456
has to keep her

05:28.120 --> 05:31.456
identity a secret.

05:31.582 --> 05:32.938
Jessie, why don't

05:32.939 --> 05:34.293
you use the invitation?

05:34.418 --> 05:35.586
Really? (GASPS)

05:40.632 --> 05:41.675
Hi, Chris.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.052
Hey, guys.

05:43.053 --> 05:44.303
Nice place.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.034
We could play

05:46.035 --> 05:47.639
full court in here.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.639
(CHUCKLES)

05:47.765 --> 05:49.659
- Uh, here, Chris. - Let me, uh,
- Take your bag.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.976
- Um, and I
- shall help.

05:51.102 --> 05:52.102
Thanks.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.854
- Give it to me.
- Oh...

05:53.979 --> 05:55.189
(BOTH GASP)

05:55.314 --> 05:56.481
(BOTH GAG)

05:58.400 --> 06:00.277
No offence, Mr. Bosh,

06:00.278 --> 06:02.154
but your bag stinks.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.178
Are you smuggling a skunk

06:04.179 --> 06:06.075
who ate burritos last night?

06:08.786 --> 06:10.141
Those are my

06:10.142 --> 06:11.496
lucky socks.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.308
- I've been wearing them
- since the tenth grade.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.333
When was the last

06:14.334 --> 06:15.334
time you washed them?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.336
- Like I said,
- tenth grade.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.111
They're my secret weapon.

06:21.112 --> 06:22.883
I can't afford to wash

06:19.338 --> 06:22.883
the luck out of them.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.323
I always thought it was

06:24.324 --> 06:25.636
your monster dunks that

06:23.008 --> 06:25.636
made the other team cry.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.575
(SNIFFS)

06:27.576 --> 06:29.389
Turns out,

06:25.761 --> 06:29.389
it's your socks.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.849
And sometimes...

06:32.935 --> 06:34.436
I pinch.

06:38.774 --> 06:39.817
I give you Kitty

06:39.818 --> 06:40.859
Couture Kitty Litter.

06:40.985 --> 06:42.924
"Kitty Glitter"?

06:42.925 --> 06:44.863
That's gross.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.616
It's going to be

06:46.617 --> 06:48.242
the defecation sensation

06:44.989 --> 06:48.242
that sweeps the nation.

06:50.995 --> 06:52.747
No. I do not want my

06:52.748 --> 06:54.498
face puking up cat litter.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.294
- Then you're gonna
- hate what you're doing

06:58.418 --> 07:00.212
- On the Kitty Couture
- fertilizer bag.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.466
- Guys, I have
- a big problem.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.615
So do I. I've got

07:06.616 --> 07:08.637
300 pounds of sparkly

07:04.591 --> 07:08.637
kitty litter to unload.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.119
- Emma, I've already
- bragged to Darla

07:14.143 --> 07:15.370
- That I'm gonna have
- my picture taken

07:15.394 --> 07:16.395
On the red carpet at

07:16.396 --> 07:17.396
this amazing party.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.127
But the fanciest

07:19.128 --> 07:20.732
thing I have to wear

07:17.521 --> 07:20.732
is my old prom dress.

07:20.858 --> 07:21.880
The one you were

07:21.881 --> 07:22.901
wearing when you

07:20.858 --> 07:22.901
knocked over the aquarium?

07:23.027 --> 07:24.549
Yes. And it's still stained

07:24.550 --> 07:26.071
with squid ink and tears.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.139
But you could turn

07:30.140 --> 07:31.160
my frown upside down

07:31.285 --> 07:32.558
by letting me borrow

07:32.559 --> 07:33.829
that Arturo Vitalli dress.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.561
Arturo sent me that

07:35.562 --> 07:37.166
dress so to review.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.166
I'm not supposed to wear it.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.169
So don't.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.045
I will wear it,

07:37.291 --> 07:41.045
and rock it.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.589
No. There will be

07:42.590 --> 07:44.006
no wearing or rocking.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.654
Because knowing you,

07:45.655 --> 07:47.176
there will also be

07:44.131 --> 07:47.176
spilling and staining.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.805
- Are, are you - saying that
- I'm clumsy?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.531
- Because you could
- not be more... Aah!

07:57.769 --> 07:59.146
(SPITTING)

08:01.148 --> 08:03.150
Could've been worse.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.402
Could've been

08:04.403 --> 08:05.527
used kitty litter.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.472
Ugh, what are

08:11.473 --> 08:13.911
you doing with

08:09.031 --> 08:13.911
Mr. Bosh's socks?

08:14.036 --> 08:15.059
I have a plan to help

08:15.060 --> 08:16.080
the Knicks beat the Heat.

08:16.205 --> 08:17.895
Phew. Oh, is that dead rodent

08:17.896 --> 08:19.583
or very expensive cheese?

08:21.293 --> 08:22.712
Neither. It's

08:22.713 --> 08:24.129
the world's

08:21.293 --> 08:24.129
stinkiest socks.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.486
Uh, could you wash

08:26.487 --> 08:28.717
everything out of them?

08:24.255 --> 08:28.717
Dirt, sweat, fungus. Luck.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.700
I'll put them

08:31.701 --> 08:32.763
in their own

08:30.635 --> 08:32.763
washing machine.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.181
- Then I'll burn
- the machine.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.214
Whoa!

08:46.215 --> 08:47.569
I mean...

08:48.070 --> 08:49.154
Wow.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.554
Zuri, do you think

08:52.555 --> 08:54.326
this dress says

08:50.781 --> 08:54.326
New York fashion event?

08:54.452 --> 08:55.912
More like the

08:55.913 --> 08:57.371
Deadliest Catch

08:54.452 --> 08:57.371

08:58.956 --> 09:00.791
What am I supposed to do?

09:00.916 --> 09:02.439
I, I need something

09:02.440 --> 09:03.961
special to wear that

09:00.916 --> 09:03.961
doesn't smell like low tide.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.902
Let's see. You need

09:06.903 --> 09:08.466
a one of-a-kind-dress.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.488
And Arturo Vitalli

09:10.489 --> 09:12.386
sent Emma a

09:08.590 --> 09:12.386
one-of-a-kind dress.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.784
Hmm, how do we

09:13.785 --> 09:15.055
connect these dots?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.224
But Emma told me not to.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.226
- You tell me not to do
- things all the time.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.270
- Yet, there's still
- a marble up my nose.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.544
Zuri, Zuri, stop.

09:24.545 --> 09:26.024
That's Emma's room.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.024
No, we really shouldn't be...

09:27.359 --> 09:29.569
Holy Sarah Jessica Parker!

09:29.694 --> 09:31.279
This is a

09:31.280 --> 09:32.864
beautiful dress.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.864
(GASPS)

09:32.990 --> 09:34.283
And it's my size.

09:34.284 --> 09:35.575
Well, clearly,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.369
- the Universe wants
- me to try this on.

09:37.495 --> 09:38.662
Right, Universe?

- that as a yes!

09:46.628 --> 09:49.548
Bibbity-bobbity-bam.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.988
How could

09:51.989 --> 09:54.303
something be so wrong

09:49.673 --> 09:54.303
but look so right?

09:54.428 --> 09:55.658
Jessie, you're

09:55.659 --> 09:56.888
kind of drooling.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.140
I always drool

09:58.141 --> 09:59.266
when I'm guilty.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.810
I promised Emma I

10:00.811 --> 10:02.227
wouldn't do this.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.227
Zuri, unzip me.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.358
I can't do this.

10:07.483 --> 10:09.693
I know, I look

10:09.694 --> 10:11.903
fantastic. But it's

10:07.483 --> 10:11.903
the right thing to do.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.718
No, I mean

10:13.719 --> 10:15.407
I can't do this.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.407
The zipper's stuck.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.451
What?

10:18.702 --> 10:20.287
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

10:20.412 --> 10:22.080
- Oh, shut up,
- Universe.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.045
Okay, Luke,

10:28.046 --> 10:29.254
it took

10:26.835 --> 10:29.254
nine washes,

10:29.380 --> 10:30.589
but I finally

10:30.590 --> 10:31.798
got the stink

10:29.380 --> 10:31.798
out of your socks.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.532
Wait, are those

10:35.533 --> 10:36.970
my lucky socks?

10:40.015 --> 10:42.135
- (SNIFFS) Why do - they smell like
- Cherry blossoms?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.772
(STILTED)

10:45.773 --> 10:47.231
Oh, no.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.231
They have been washed.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.985
Nooo!

10:54.112 --> 10:55.323
What a diva. Next time

10:55.324 --> 10:56.532
I'll use ocean breeze.

No.

11:22.892 --> 11:25.060
we are not doing

11:20.722 --> 11:25.060
a Kitty Couture board game.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.104
- And if we were,
- wearing a pantsuit

11:27.229 --> 11:28.836
Would lose you way more

11:28.837 --> 11:30.441
than six hundred points.

Good note.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.048

Let's just say,

12:51.563 --> 12:53.315
- it was because
- I had a full diaper.

it on for a second,

- Use the kids' - water fountain
- At the Plaza.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.167
That was a bidet.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.483
- Is that French
- for water fountain?

14:40.922 --> 14:42.006
Sure.

15:44.863 --> 15:46.697
like that, it doesn't

15:43.026 --> 15:46.697
sound as fun.

15:48.406 --> 15:50.325
- It's not.
- Just fix it.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.851
Fix it? How am I supposed

15:54.852 --> 15:57.123
to make Chris' lucky socks

15:52.577 --> 15:57.123
lucky again?

15:57.248 --> 15:58.604
Well, Chris thought

15:58.605 --> 15:59.959
they were lucky when

15:57.248 --> 15:59.959
they smelled like

16:00.084 --> 16:01.211
egg salad threw up

16:01.212 --> 16:02.337
on a fart.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.590
That's right.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.051
Oh, but how am I

16:07.052 --> 16:08.385
supposed to put

16:05.716 --> 16:08.385
13 years worth of stink

16:08.510 --> 16:09.969
back on those socks?

16:10.094 --> 16:12.222
by itself,

16:13.097 --> 16:14.474

- in you, brother.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.773
- Curdled milk?
- Milk.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.944
- Rotten meat?
- Meat.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.780
- Fish guts?
- Guts.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.015
Okay. Do you think

16:34.016 --> 16:35.286
they're stinky enough?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.539
Considering we are

16:37.540 --> 16:39.666
both still conscious,

16:35.412 --> 16:39.666
probably not.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.193

16:45.194 --> 16:47.507
a cab going to help us

16:42.878 --> 16:47.507
stink up Mr. Bosh's socks?

16:47.632 --> 16:48.842
Just stand

16:48.843 --> 16:50.051
right there.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.597

(CAR APPROACHING)

17:00.938 --> 17:02.063
Perfect.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.130
Could we not have

17:06.131 --> 17:08.111
just stuck the socks

17:04.147 --> 17:08.111
in the dirty gutter water?

17:10.113 --> 17:12.113
- Sure, but where's - the fun in that?

I can't believe

17:35.431 --> 17:36.514
you fixed it.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.954
When Darla sees

17:37.955 --> 17:39.267
a picture of you

17:36.640 --> 17:39.267
in this dress,

17:39.392 --> 17:40.936
it's going to kill her.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.730
Oh, that's so sweet.

Emma, you are a wizard

And duct tape.

Luke?

Jessie? Chris' game

17:59.414 --> 18:01.247
is in twenty minutes,

17:57.577 --> 18:01.247
and he refuses to go.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.478
I know I said

18:02.479 --> 18:03.583
I wanted to

18:01.372 --> 18:03.583
make him lose.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.027
But that was

18:10.028 --> 18:11.716
before I saw his sad

18:08.338 --> 18:11.716
little Chris Bosh face.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.803
I thought I said fix it.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.075
Well, we did.

18:16.076 --> 18:17.221
We re-stunk

18:14.928 --> 18:17.221
Chris's socks

18:17.347 --> 18:18.452
and gave them back to him,

18:18.453 --> 18:19.557
but it's not working.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.440
- Stink was how you
- chose to fix it?

18:27.565 --> 18:29.275
- Why is that your
- answer for everything?

18:31.152 --> 18:32.403
What should I have done?

18:32.529 --> 18:33.864
Apologize to him.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.038
Oh, I think we're

18:41.039 --> 18:42.539
way past that.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.646
- Just hold on.
- I'll be right there.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.294
- But Jessie,
- you don't have time.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.220
- Look, the park is on
- the way to the party.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.443
I'll help Chris,

18:51.444 --> 18:52.590

18:50.296 --> 18:52.590
to make it to the red carpet.

18:58.035 --> 18:59.138

- Think I could
- make this work.

It's no use.

19:12.487 --> 19:13.570

- I don't have time for.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.632

19:32.296 --> 19:34.632

19:39.869 --> 19:41.056

- Chris, you can't - seriously consider
- Quitting

19:44.435 --> 19:45.685
a pair of socks.

- a great player

Because of your

not because of some

was a long shot.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.928
Oh, that's terrible.

- It cost sixty
- thousand dollars.

21:17.028 --> 21:18.486
see a cool picture of

me on the internet.

one big humiliation.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.803
On the bright side,

21:22.804 --> 21:24.117
I made a basket.

Coming Mr. LeBron.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.921
Next thing you know,

I'm drenched

21:34.711 --> 21:37.130
in Grape-orade,

21:37.255 --> 21:38.277
so I never even made

21:38.278 --> 21:39.298
it onto the red carpet.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.446
And I practiced my

21:40.447 --> 21:41.467
poses and everything.

I'm starting to think

21:49.582 --> 21:51.228
you dodged a bullet.
