Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:02.679 --> 00:04.229
This is what you are all about.

00:04.349 --> 00:09.788
Your marriage was only worth
something to you when it was falling apart

00:09.856 --> 00:12.394
You're being intimate with--with
Janet a-and Sheila again?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.247
Maybe I am.

00:13.318 --> 00:14.173
These are women, Tom.

00:14.196 --> 00:16.765
Women have--they got more strings
than a goddamn baseball.

00:16.820 --> 00:20.675
Sheila's Red Sox. I'm the Yankees.
I have a hell of a lot more to offer.

00:20.795 --> 00:21.798
How do you figure that?

00:21.918 --> 00:23.686
Because I come with your children.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.434
It's time to stop.

00:25.554 --> 00:27.905
We're all here because
we love you, Tommy.

00:28.025 --> 00:29.958
And if not for you,
think about your children.

00:30.078 --> 00:31.593
What about Katy and Colleen?

00:31.641 --> 00:32.819
What are they feeling?

00:32.855 --> 00:33.894
I'm glad you're not drinking.

00:34.014 --> 00:37.450
It used scare me sometimes, you know,
like--like you were somebody else.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.019
Come on, Tom. Think about it.

00:39.139 --> 00:42.279
It's a prison with 2 ways out, sobriety
or the graveyard.

00:44.954 --> 00:45.749
Anyone else?

00:45.869 --> 00:47.024
Yeah. Give me one.

00:47.144 --> 00:49.170
Yeah. You know what? Me, too.

00:49.238 --> 00:50.739
- Just a tall one.
- OK.

00:51.858 --> 00:53.794
Family that drinks together.

00:54.083 --> 00:54.936
Sinks together.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.090
Heh ha. Mmm.

00:57.678 --> 00:58.984
Where the hell'd Ellie go?

01:00.617 --> 01:05.066
To Ellie.
May God kiss and rest her soul.

01:05.096 --> 01:06.057
Amen to that.

01:07.203 --> 01:11.108
You took the best thing I ever
had away from me, asshole.

01:12.198 --> 01:14.359
We're gonna sit here for the
next few hours

01:15.504 --> 01:17.858
and watch Tom slowly fade away.

Wanna see my new trick, dad?

01:53.135 --> 01:53.932
You'll see when you get here.

01:53.973 --> 01:55.432
It used to scare me sometimes.

01:55.493 --> 01:56.242
So you're not mad?

01:56.275 --> 01:57.611
We should renew our vows.

01:57.679 --> 01:58.954
I'm your best bet.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.263
Welcome, brother.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.421
Come on.

03:46.492 --> 03:49.193
So happy to see you, cuz.
It seemed like forever.

04:01.813 --> 04:05.409
Ha ha ha ha! Wait up, Steve-O.

04:59.457 --> 05:01.200
Shit.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.290
No! Help! Aah!

05:10.173 --> 05:11.462
Shit.

05:14.502 --> 05:17.136
Why couldn't you save us, Tommy?
Why not?

05:17.204 --> 05:21.464
You said you'd come back to get me on 9/11.
You never came back to get me.

05:26.348 --> 05:27.201
Tommy!

- Johnny.

Johnny's old partner has covered

06:37.355 --> 06:38.870
As far as the law is concerned,

06:38.990 --> 06:42.398
it was a bunch of drunken assholes
and a couple of stray bullets. But...

06:43.788 --> 06:49.082
The Fire Department, this city,
is in a goddamn recession.

06:49.429 --> 06:52.356
The Mayor's gonna have
to close a couple of firehouses.

06:52.688 --> 06:56.757
The word I hear is that this house is
number one on the list.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.413
Shut up. Shut up. I said shut up.

07:02.521 --> 07:05.712
Renegades, renegade house-

07:06.616 --> 07:09.449
those are the terms I'm hearing being
thrown around down at headquarters.

07:09.796 --> 07:13.706
And the boozing
and the broads and now the hero,

07:13.826 --> 07:17.122
the rebel, this antiauthority fireman,

07:17.917 --> 07:20.201
the one who survived 9/11,

07:20.910 --> 07:24.506
is left bleeding on the
floor of a bar full--full of his

07:25.330 --> 07:27.497
full of compatriots.

07:29.448 --> 07:30.648
Guess what.

07:32.354 --> 07:33.511
He wasn't bulletproof,

07:34.740 --> 07:36.852
and neither are any one
of you assholes.

07:37.633 --> 07:38.645
Now listen to me.

07:38.934 --> 07:41.710
I didn't spend 40 years
getting to this position

07:41.956 --> 07:44.269
so I could end up with
a dishonorable discharge.

07:44.601 --> 07:47.146
Didn't happen in Vietnam,
and it's not gonna happen here.

07:47.876 --> 07:49.250
And if they close this house,

07:49.279 --> 07:51.192
it's gonna be with my full cooperation.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.382
Whoa, whoa.

07:54.045 --> 07:55.144
What are you sayin'?

07:56.170 --> 07:57.067
You're gonna be like a--

07:57.187 --> 07:58.363
like a snitch or somethin'?

07:58.431 --> 08:00.927
You know, you--you got blood
on your hands, pal.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.775
You were a commanding officer

08:02.843 --> 08:04.437
in an off-duty situation,

08:04.557 --> 08:05.983
and you did not step up.

08:06.358 --> 08:07.758
Hey, you know what?

08:08.104 --> 08:11.107
- You were in that bar drinkin', too.
- Not when they pulled the gun, shithead.

08:11.804 --> 08:14.103
You wanna run with these guys?
You wanna be one of them?

08:14.223 --> 08:16.580
Guess what. From now on,

08:16.605 --> 08:19.376
you are permanently one of the guys.

08:21.106 --> 08:22.198
All bets are off.

08:24.215 --> 08:25.332
You wanna keep that bar,

08:25.452 --> 08:27.462
you better make sure that
somebody else's name

08:27.582 --> 08:29.660
is legally in charge of that place.

08:30.239 --> 08:31.724
We already took care of that, sir.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.426
Yeah, we basically
just work there now.

08:33.767 --> 08:36.030
Good. Another thing.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.717
I would suggest you start
looking around for another house,

08:40.154 --> 08:44.101
because this house
is on its last goddamn legs.

08:54.349 --> 08:57.580
Yeah? Go on. Go, go, go.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.147
What's wrong with you?

09:07.545 --> 09:09.439
So how's the shoulder, huh?

09:09.873 --> 09:14.286
It's fine, you know.
It's a little sore. It'll be fine.

09:14.575 --> 09:15.428
Mm-hmm.

09:15.548 --> 09:16.773
Ooh. Man.

09:17.522 --> 09:19.902
Maggie said you weren't
due out for another week.

09:19.970 --> 09:22.291
Yeah. They wanted me to do that
bullshit physical therapy.

09:22.314 --> 09:23.339
I was goin' nuts anyways.

09:23.407 --> 09:24.775
- I'm like, "I'm not doin' it."
- Yeah, what's in the bag?

09:25.609 --> 09:27.315
What--my, uh, clothes.

09:29.041 --> 09:29.912
Really?

09:29.980 --> 09:31.846
Yeah. You know, I...

09:32.930 --> 09:35.183
It's the clothes I had on when
I got shot, whatever. It's my stuff.

09:35.251 --> 09:36.388
- It's... You know.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:36.508 --> 09:38.566
Like prison, right? You know,
what you check in with,

09:38.686 --> 09:41.121
they give you when you leave.
Heh heh heh.

09:41.445 --> 09:46.462
Yeah, like the joint, only shittier food.
What are you doin'?

09:48.081 --> 09:49.165
Jesus, Mick.

09:50.555 --> 09:53.158
I tell ya, must have been
tough not drinkin' that whole time, huh?

09:53.750 --> 09:55.876
 Bein' a whole month in the hospital
without any booze

09:56.273 --> 09:58.628
Way you drink, must
have been on the verge of the DTs.

09:58.669 --> 10:01.464
No. Morphine, asshole.
I had a morphine drip.

10:01.584 --> 10:03.878
Mmm. Morphine drip. Right.

10:03.946 --> 10:07.783
Right, right. Yeah, but don't they
gradually ease you off of that shit? Ohh!

10:08.951 --> 10:11.173
Jesus! What the hell?

10:11.214 --> 10:12.474
Whooee!

10:14.440 --> 10:15.279
Open the bag.

10:15.399 --> 10:16.016
Jesus.

10:16.136 --> 10:19.426
- I said open the bag, asshole.
- Jesus Christ, Mick.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.227
Jesus Christ. Jesus.

10:21.295 --> 10:24.614
You know, remember when we were kids and
our parents would say don't do somethin'?

10:24.734 --> 10:27.366
You were always the first guy to say,
"Hey, let's do it right now."

10:27.434 --> 10:32.294
Whenever the nuns said, "Hey, don't laugh,"
you were always the first one cacklin'.

10:32.324 --> 10:33.317
She doesn't see us.

10:33.437 --> 10:37.008
Shit. Shit. Shit.

10:37.076 --> 10:38.509
Goddamn it!

10:38.577 --> 10:40.732
Whenever the priest said,
you know, such and such was sin

10:40.852 --> 10:42.050
was a sin, you were always
the first guy to say,

10:42.069 --> 10:43.713
"Hey, let's give it a go," you know?

10:43.833 --> 10:45.982
- Booze, weed, jerking off...
- Turn the car around.

10:46.050 --> 10:49.181
Fightin' fires. You didn't care. You were
the first man and last man standing,

10:49.301 --> 10:51.854
the rebel, the rebel with a cause,

10:51.922 --> 10:54.815
Mr. Break all the rules,
Mr. Go against the grain. Well,

10:54.935 --> 10:57.325
Well, you're goin' against the grain
now, asshole. How does it feel?

10:57.392 --> 10:58.926
Watch the road!

11:04.898 --> 11:05.698
Ah.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.224
Hey, man! What are you doin'?!

11:08.234 --> 11:09.567
- Fun, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

11:11.257 --> 11:12.561
What the hell is your problem?!

11:12.588 --> 11:14.205
I got--I got a sick man in the car.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.382
He better be sick!

11:16.450 --> 11:17.317
What?

11:18.460 --> 11:19.443
No.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.841
Oh, boy. Was Maggie onto you?

11:26.579 --> 11:28.582
She knew you would have been beggin'
for a bottle of somethin'

11:28.605 --> 11:31.263
if you didn't already have drugs
to satisfy your jones.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.368
That's why you had to run out
of that place this morning, isn't it?

11:34.581 --> 11:36.904
 'Cause you knocked over the medicine room
on the way out. You wanna know

11:37.491 --> 11:40.875
 'Cause you wanna know somethin'?
I knew it as soon as you called me.

11:45.757 --> 11:46.711
Where do you think you're goin'?

11:47.593 --> 11:49.848
I'm not gettin' in the car with a
drunk driver, I'll tell you that.

11:49.896 --> 11:50.690
Oh, some drunk driver.

11:51.221 --> 11:54.540
Yeah, that's right. You just fill them
full of booze and send 'em on their way.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.282
Oh, but look what
you found, though. Huh?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.098
- That's right.
- Yeah, why don't you take a nice pop?

11:59.130 --> 12:01.690
- I will.
- Yeah. Bottoms up, brother.

12:04.697 --> 12:08.268
It's water. An old trick of yours
used against you.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.764
That feeling you had at the pit
at the bottom of your ball sac

12:11.831 --> 12:15.367
there when that traffic was bearin' down
on us, that's just one iota of the fear

12:15.416 --> 12:18.438
that's stuck in your daughter Katy's
throat and Colleen's throat

12:18.939 --> 12:20.030
and Janet's throat.

12:20.581 --> 12:22.985
 Hell, in my throat the night
you died in the back of the ambulance.

12:23.475 --> 12:25.137
I got news for you, asshole.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.482
You ain't no rebel, OK?
All rebels die young.

12:28.602 --> 12:31.415
James Dean, 25 when he ate it.
Thurman Munson was 32.

12:31.483 --> 12:34.859
Belushi, same age.
You're just too old to be a goddamn rebel.

12:34.979 --> 12:38.411
All you are is another goddamn drunk.

12:39.539 --> 12:40.609
It's over, shithead.

12:41.175 --> 12:43.907
I haven't had a drop since
that second bullet hit you in the arm.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.629
I'm done. And so are you. Get in.

12:48.236 --> 12:49.590
I'm takin' you over to see Teddy.

12:49.647 --> 12:50.867
He's in the back of Dempsey's.

12:50.923 --> 12:52.033
He wants to have a sit-down with you.

12:52.101 --> 12:54.214
I'm not goin' to sit down with Teddy.
What are you, nuts?

12:54.469 --> 12:55.903
- Oh, you're not, huh?
- No.

12:56.246 --> 12:57.446
What were you gonna do?

12:58.343 --> 12:59.543
Got any cash on you?

13:02.044 --> 13:05.037
No cash. Aw, well. Yeah.
There's the bus over there.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.809
I know what you could do.

13:08.518 --> 13:09.949
You could sell all the morphine.

13:10.231 --> 13:12.038
There's 2 junkie-lookin' mutts
over there.

13:12.552 --> 13:13.890
Yo!

13:14.656 --> 13:17.186
This guy here, he's got
a bag full of morphine

13:17.306 --> 13:18.756
bag full of morphine, for free.

13:18.824 --> 13:20.641
- No. No, no.
- Big bag.

13:22.448 --> 13:25.894
Those guys are comin' over, asshole.

13:27.499 --> 13:29.142
This is what we're reduced to.

13:29.262 --> 13:30.992
I mean, this is what
we gained from 9/11,

13:31.368 --> 13:33.494
pay scale that barely keeps a married probie

13:33.538 --> 13:36.265
with 2 kids above the poverty
level, and now they wanna close ore houses.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.936
Biggest rescue effort in the history of fire service

13:39.056 --> 13:41.494
and 10 years later, we're
gettin' it right up the ass.

13:41.561 --> 13:43.188
Yeah, but let's be honest
ourselves, fellas.

13:43.225 --> 13:45.542
In this house, we haven't exactly
done ourselves any favors.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.929
Hey, we have the
second-quickest response time

13:47.963 --> 13:50.121
in the entire department, and we
average 9 calls a shift.

13:50.157 --> 13:51.466
That's gotta count for somethin'.

13:51.521 --> 13:54.438
The only houses threatened with a shutdown
that survived, as far as I know...

13:54.493 --> 13:55.707
and there ain't been
a hell of a lot of them...

13:55.827 --> 13:58.980
...have had huge community
protests goin' on to support 'em.

13:59.409 --> 14:00.573
You mean like from the neighborhood?

14:00.641 --> 14:01.174
Yeah.

14:01.242 --> 14:02.675
Yeah.
This neighborhood's scary.

14:02.743 --> 14:04.911
You know what? They're all
being invited to our cookout.

14:04.978 --> 14:05.946
Wait. What cookout?

14:06.014 --> 14:08.618
We are having a huge cookout,
and everybody is coming in,

14:08.685 --> 14:10.781
and we are gonna stuff them all
full of free food.

14:10.811 --> 14:12.954
You know, hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza.

14:13.022 --> 14:17.124
Cheap eats, great public relation
even Feinberg's gotta get behind us.

14:17.192 --> 14:20.117
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I like that.
Get 'em in here. Load 'em up.

14:20.237 --> 14:21.627
You know, and then have
'em call the Mayor's office.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.163
Yo, I found this on the
telephone pole out front.

14:24.367 --> 14:24.897
What is it?

14:24.964 --> 14:27.832
Westside Wildmen, 8 blocks over,
listen to this:

14:27.952 --> 14:30.502
Mayor's thinkin' about shuttin'
down their house, so

14:30.622 --> 14:34.186
they're having a pig roast and the
entire neighborhood is invited.

14:34.306 --> 14:37.275
Check it out.
They got, uh, peppered corn on the cob,

14:37.649 --> 14:41.741
broccoli slaw... And some
homemade sweet rolls.

14:41.861 --> 14:45.141
What else? Uh! Lavender limeade.

14:47.498 --> 14:48.828
What? Y'all don't like pig?

14:58.604 --> 15:01.208
I wanna tell you I'm
sorry for what I've done.

15:04.109 --> 15:07.174
- Well, it's certainly good to hear that...
- But I ain't.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.615
I figure the only reason I let you live
that night was 'cause of Ellie.

15:11.117 --> 15:14.861
I sat there, and I thought,
"She wouldn't dig this."

15:15.382 --> 15:17.435
 I mean, she drunk all the drinks herself.

15:18.034 --> 15:20.362
You poured 'em down, but you
didn't pour 'em down her throat.

15:20.482 --> 15:26.073
She did. So I stood up, and
I walked out, and the rest--

15:26.566 --> 15:28.257
the rest I left in God's hands.

15:29.255 --> 15:32.357
- So...
- So what?

15:32.424 --> 15:34.190
So go to hell. Go to heaven.

15:34.257 --> 15:36.407
However you want it to play out,
it's up to you.

15:37.029 --> 15:40.050
Here. I got you a little somethin'.

15:41.135 --> 15:43.428
Go ahead. Open it. Ain't gonna bite.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.823
I got you these as a reminder.

15:48.879 --> 15:52.058
 I was at the hospital after.
Immediate family.

15:52.593 --> 15:55.644
Just for the record, that night,
the night you died and came back,

15:55.764 --> 16:00.159
immediate family was me, the Mick,
your sister, and the guys in the crew.

16:00.578 --> 16:04.116
No Janet. No Sheila. Just the guys.

16:04.824 --> 16:06.400
Even the Jew chief came down.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.319
Anyways, I asked 'em
for the bullets inside you.

16:09.527 --> 16:11.432
That's what you're lookin' at
right there.

16:12.485 --> 16:14.854
Us Gavins, we're so dysfunctional,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.919
we make the Jackson family
look like the goddamn Osmonds.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.731
Well, I'll guarantee you this.

16:20.324 --> 16:22.593
From here on in, different story.

16:23.461 --> 16:26.031
You ain't gonna hurt anybody
in this family no more.

16:26.079 --> 16:27.455
Jesus, Mickey.
He's got a gun.

16:27.523 --> 16:30.540
I know. Actually he's got 2.

16:31.759 --> 16:32.658
Relax.

16:32.726 --> 16:35.251
Calm down.
If I wanted to shoot your ass again,

16:35.281 --> 16:38.910
you'd already be dead.
You got a second chance.

16:39.117 --> 16:39.953
 You can do good,

16:40.583 --> 16:44.214
or you can do shit, which is
mostly what you've done so far.

16:44.334 --> 16:45.679
But this time around,

16:45.799 --> 16:49.269
you do shit, I'm gonna hunt you down
and kill you a second time.

16:49.545 --> 16:56.085
From this moment on, you drink, I drive.
Now screw.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.615
Don't forget your cuff links.

17:14.807 --> 17:18.971
So all that time I was laid up, Janet
never came by the hospital, huh?

17:19.090 --> 17:23.749
No. Can't blame her.
I mean, she was pissed.

17:24.182 --> 17:26.436
Plus she didn't want the kids
to see you laid up like that.

17:27.442 --> 17:29.367
It was the right thing to do.

17:29.911 --> 17:31.526
Yeah, I guess.

17:35.053 --> 17:38.498
Katy, turn the TV off and
start your homework now.

17:39.033 --> 17:41.219
And, Colleen, turn the music down.

17:41.287 --> 17:42.487
Hey. Hi.

17:42.555 --> 17:43.855
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:43.922 --> 17:45.356
Uh, just--just a second.

17:45.424 --> 17:46.391
Hey. Daddy.

17:46.459 --> 17:48.860
Hey. What's going on?

17:48.928 --> 17:51.529
I thought you weren't supposed
to be home for another week.

17:51.596 --> 17:56.265
Well, I go--I was, but I got a special,
you know, thing from the doctor, so yeah.

17:56.333 --> 17:56.802
I missed you.

17:56.851 --> 17:57.867
I missed you, too, sweetie.

17:57.934 --> 17:59.434
Good.

17:59.502 --> 18:00.736
Uh, go tell your sister.

18:00.803 --> 18:03.633
Right. Colleen.

18:03.753 --> 18:06.249
- Uh, which is the bad shoulder?
- This one. This one.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.008
Ohh! Honey.

18:08.075 --> 18:09.542
Listen hard and listen fast.

18:09.610 --> 18:10.210
Jesus, honey.

18:10.278 --> 18:11.830
I am here until you decide to stop.

18:12.235 --> 18:14.679
Ok, the kids don't like it,
but I don't give a shit.

18:14.799 --> 18:17.649
Ok, you wanna drink,
you're gonna drink here on my watch.

18:17.717 --> 18:21.024
You wanna drink till you puke or
pass out or start a fire,

18:21.144 --> 18:23.422
I will be here to protect my kids.

18:24.322 --> 18:26.819
I've been on my own
this whole goddamn time.

18:27.262 --> 18:29.826
Well, except for the guys,
thank God for them.

18:29.893 --> 18:35.321
Lou fixed the sink, and, Sean,
well, he didn't really do a lot,

18:35.367 --> 18:39.541
but he we pleasant. But Franco...
But he was a godsend.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.502
He fixed the car. He fixed the stove.

18:42.570 --> 18:44.537
Did you know that he cooks?

18:44.605 --> 18:45.538
No.

18:45.606 --> 18:49.061
He was amazing. He baby-sat for me.
He helped Katy with her homework.

18:49.635 --> 18:51.546
You know, you name it, he did it.

18:51.614 --> 18:54.080
Hmm. I'll bet he did.

18:55.410 --> 18:56.769
How's your shoulder?

18:57.287 --> 18:58.821
Sore.

18:58.889 --> 18:59.512
Ohh! Honey.

18:59.632 --> 19:01.038
Is that all that you think about?

19:01.158 --> 19:04.498
You wanna know, if a guy as hot
as Franco actually came on to me,

19:04.550 --> 19:06.270
I would jump at the chance,

19:06.390 --> 19:07.752
but there ain't a lot of hunks out there

19:07.812 --> 19:12.228
looking for a soon-to-be-divorced 45-year-old
mom stinking very much like baby puke.

19:13.441 --> 19:15.306
- Be happy.
- What?

19:17.944 --> 19:19.154
Hi.

19:20.682 --> 19:22.721
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:23.142 --> 19:25.409
At least she's allowed to
drink in the house now.

19:25.477 --> 19:26.176
What?

19:26.244 --> 19:29.229
Yeah. She, uh--she said she'd
rather have me doing it here

19:29.246 --> 19:31.094
than out in some dive bar somewhere.

19:31.148 --> 19:32.338
That's right.

19:33.416 --> 19:36.423
Is she even
old enough to drink?

19:37.400 --> 19:41.566
Yeah. I, um--I turned 21, actually.

19:41.803 --> 19:43.439
But you weren't here to celebrate

19:43.476 --> 19:46.045
because--oh, right--you were dead.

19:46.165 --> 19:49.261
But don't worry. You got me an amazing
pair of Jeffrey Campbell boots,

19:49.312 --> 19:51.747
so happy birthday to me.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.466
Who's Jeffrey Campbell?

19:55.463 --> 19:58.729
I don't know, but I know that he's
wealthy, with the price of those boots.

20:02.546 --> 20:04.836
Don't worry.
I don't have a drinking problem.

20:05.212 --> 20:06.744
It is genetic.

20:06.812 --> 20:08.923
So is being a bitch, bitch.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.267
Hey.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.112
I'll just be a minute.

20:16.668 --> 20:18.162
Here, daddy.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.184
Ooh. What's that, honey?

20:21.304 --> 20:23.718
Whiskey neat. Or would you rather
have vodka?

20:23.838 --> 20:25.525
No, no. That's...that's fine.

20:29.917 --> 20:34.889
Go ahead. It's OK. I know you want it.

20:35.009 --> 20:39.604
We have gin too, but that's what
Colleen drinks. It tastes like gasoline.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.963
I, uh--I just remembered I gotta...

20:48.995 --> 20:51.341
I told the guys I'd drop down
to the firehouse.

20:51.394 --> 20:54.382
So I'm...I'll just have that later. Ok?

20:54.724 --> 20:59.036
Mm-hmm. Curfew's 11:30.

20:59.156 --> 21:00.221
Got it.

21:12.919 --> 21:16.028
Hey, Lou, you ever get the 411
from Tommy about what went down

21:16.148 --> 21:18.634
you know, when he died?
Like did he see shit or whatever?

21:18.702 --> 21:20.633
Well, according to him, nothing.
He said it was kinda

21:20.753 --> 21:25.291
He said it was kinda like taking a nap,
and when he woke up, he felt like shit,

21:25.344 --> 21:28.145
which of course, in the world
of Tommy is just another day.

21:28.213 --> 21:29.713
Hey, ask me if I believe him?

21:29.781 --> 21:30.880
- You believe him?
- No.

21:30.948 --> 21:33.429
Hey, uh, you know, I read a book 
once about people who died.

21:33.606 --> 21:34.450
Oh, yeah? The whole book?

21:34.791 --> 21:36.837
Yeah. Yeah, wow. Read a whole book.

21:37.705 --> 21:41.102
Yeah, well, most of it, anyway.
Like the first 8 chapters.

21:41.363 --> 21:43.885
Wait a second. Is this that book about
crossing over to the other side?

21:44.005 --> 21:44.756
You read that?

21:44.792 --> 21:47.177
Uh, yeah. You gave it to me,
asshole, remember,

21:47.198 --> 21:49.634
after like chapter 2, because you said it
was keepin' you up at night.

21:49.701 --> 21:51.102
Well, it's scary.
You can't deny that.

21:51.169 --> 21:53.437
Uh-huh. So, like, I read
the whole thing, and then,

21:53.504 --> 21:56.356
like a douche bag, every time
I try to tell you another story

21:56.389 --> 21:58.970
about it, you end up coverin' your ears
and hummin' like a 12-year-old girl.

21:59.002 --> 22:00.042
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is true.

22:00.110 --> 22:00.842
No, no. I don't do that.

22:00.910 --> 22:03.685
Ok, what about the story of the lady
trapped underneath the overturned bus?

22:03.715 --> 22:04.278
Hey, don't do that.

22:04.305 --> 22:06.769
She slowly suffocated because her
crushed rips are puncturing...

22:06.845 --> 22:08.207
- ♪ La la la la la la la la ♪
- You see?

22:08.255 --> 22:12.373
Now listen. But my point is it's
about, you know, dying.

22:13.255 --> 22:15.819
The people in that book, they--they
said they saw, like, a light,

22:15.887 --> 22:17.687
a great white light, and they
all had to walk towards it.

22:17.755 --> 22:18.686
You know, that whole thing.

22:19.062 --> 22:20.399
It's a very common theme.

22:20.519 --> 22:21.425
A lot of people have that.

22:21.459 --> 22:24.143
You think that means there's a heaven?

22:24.263 --> 22:27.702
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- There's gotta be a hell, right?

22:27.822 --> 22:29.784
Sure. Can't have one without the other.

22:30.203 --> 22:32.944
And in my heaven, every man
that's ever done this job

22:33.064 --> 22:36.371
and laid down his life in the line
of duty, like the 343 from 9/11,

22:36.756 --> 22:38.206
they get the best seats in the house.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.508
- Damn right.
- Mikey, you're with me.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.099
You got it, chief.

22:41.141 --> 22:41.877
- Hey, Lou.
- Yes.

22:41.997 --> 22:42.977
You believe in heaven?

22:43.045 --> 22:43.978
Yes, I do.

22:44.046 --> 22:45.579
What's heaven like for you?

22:45.983 --> 22:52.006
- Free hot doughnuts on floating trays.
- Hmm. And what about hell?

22:52.126 --> 22:53.052
Barbra Streisand.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.153
Ha ha! Is she singing?

22:54.221 --> 22:54.835
No, she's not singing.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.021
She's alone. She's just there.

22:56.089 --> 22:58.356
She's just kinda loitering, and
I'm burning up with flames.

22:58.424 --> 23:00.657
They're lickin' my body, and
she's just standin' there...

23:00.691 --> 23:03.352
a couple yards away, just lookin' at me
with that weird, crazed,

23:03.382 --> 23:06.072
kinda go-funny eye of hers,
just glarin' at me.

23:06.722 --> 23:08.125
For Hitler, she'd be singing.

23:08.752 --> 23:10.532
Oh, I get it, because she's Jewish.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.284
Hey.

23:11.314 --> 23:12.367
That is actually funny.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.067
Hey, man.

23:13.135 --> 23:13.901
Hey! Hey!

23:13.968 --> 23:14.567
What's goin' on?

23:14.635 --> 23:15.301
What's up?

23:15.369 --> 23:16.502
How you doin'?

23:16.503 --> 23:17.869
Look at you. You look good.

23:17.937 --> 23:19.137
Hey. Let's watch that shoulder.

23:19.205 --> 23:19.567
Oh, yeah.

23:19.586 --> 23:20.048
Tommy.

23:20.168 --> 23:21.440
- Hey.
- How you doing, man?

23:21.508 --> 23:23.796
What's going on? What, did they let
you out early for good behavior?

23:23.844 --> 23:27.598
No. I was just doin'
the physical therapy bullshit.

23:27.718 --> 23:31.013
Did I hear correctly? Did you-- did you go
by my house a couple time while...

23:31.517 --> 23:32.082
I was laid up?

23:32.327 --> 23:34.117
Couple of times, yeah.
I was there almost every day.

23:34.185 --> 23:36.151
Spent the night a
couple times, too, bro.

23:36.219 --> 23:37.852
Slept over? Jeez.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.051
Yeah, I was gonna, too, actually,

23:39.089 --> 23:41.389
but I've been nervous ever since I got
hospitalized, I gotta be in my own bed.

23:41.456 --> 23:42.900
I been sleep-dancing.

23:43.691 --> 23:46.592
Anyway, don't sweat it, bro. I know
you would've done the same thing for me.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.652
Well, yeah, especially if, you
know--hey, how you--how you doin'?

23:50.211 --> 23:53.364
Hi. If you were married
to a really hot chick. I--

23:53.432 --> 23:55.159
I appreciate it.
It's just that...

23:55.279 --> 23:57.053
if somethin' happens to me again...

23:57.530 --> 24:00.370
- Just don't go by the house, OK? Just...
- Does that go for me, too?

24:00.931 --> 24:03.205
No, no, you can go by the house. I don't
have a problem with you goin' by the house.

24:03.273 --> 24:05.533
Oh, wait a second,
so a sleepwalker can go...

24:05.570 --> 24:07.177
No, no, I wasn't...
It was sleep-dancing.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.046
But Puerto Ricans, not allowed.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.381
No, no, no, no. It's not
a Puerto Rican thing, OK? It's a--

24:12.043 --> 24:12.982
It's a Puerto Rican hunk thing.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.633
It's more about her than it is about you.
Don't--you know.

24:16.068 --> 24:17.085
- Ok?
- Ok.

24:17.638 --> 24:18.902
Well, somebody's back up to speed.

24:18.961 --> 24:20.953
His first day out,
he's already in a jealous rage.

24:20.968 --> 24:23.451
What rage? I'm...this...
I'm having a conversation.

24:23.486 --> 24:24.589
What was that supposed to mean?
When you said that about the hunk thing?

24:24.895 --> 24:26.724
That I'm not a hunk?
Is that what you meant by that?

24:26.792 --> 24:28.487
Nobody's--you're not--
well, I-- don't--don't--

24:28.530 --> 24:29.894
if he's a hunk, I'm a hunk.

24:29.962 --> 24:33.530
Ok. Look, you're both hunks
when the dead walk the earth.

24:33.598 --> 24:34.264
Hey, can I go?

24:34.332 --> 24:36.199
Why would you do that, Michael?
It's only girls over there.

24:36.267 --> 24:40.602
I like chicks, Frank, and besides, I happen
to find Tommy's wife extremely attractive.

24:40.670 --> 24:42.236
Oh?
Ooh.

24:42.303 --> 24:43.236
Okay.

24:43.304 --> 24:44.131
You're not goin'.

24:44.251 --> 24:46.181
All right? Happy now?

24:46.574 --> 24:47.740
I can go.

24:47.808 --> 24:49.374
Yeah, well, why can he go?
It's ridiculous.

24:49.442 --> 24:50.642
'Cause he's bangin' my cousin.

24:50.709 --> 24:54.077
Ahh! That's it.
Nobody's ever goin'. All right?

24:54.145 --> 24:57.245
There it is. See, that's the
Tommy we know and love.

24:57.365 --> 25:00.948
Hurry up and get back in the saddle,
'cause we may not be here that long.

25:01.016 --> 25:02.149
What do you mean?

25:03.075 --> 25:04.918
Ah, that shootin' left
us a little vulnerable.

25:04.986 --> 25:06.750
Yeah. Mayor's closin'
down houses.

25:06.870 --> 25:09.579
We got a big target on our back.

25:10.027 --> 25:14.105
So do the West Side Wildmen, and only
one of us is gonna be shut down.

25:14.654 --> 25:17.961
 And none of their guys have got
bullet holes in 'em.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.176
Oh...

25:22.562 --> 25:24.991
All right. Let me...

25:25.627 --> 25:27.868
Let me take the beating on this one, guys.
Let me stand up and,

25:28.641 --> 25:30.188
you know, take the blame.

25:30.308 --> 25:34.704
All right? You know, step up and sacrifice
myself for the sake of the house.

25:35.629 --> 25:37.109
It's the right thing to do.

25:37.511 --> 25:38.552
Really?

25:38.914 --> 25:39.740
Yeah.

25:41.345 --> 25:42.299
It's perfect.

25:43.485 --> 25:44.222
Yeah.

25:44.743 --> 25:45.697
All right, come on.

25:45.817 --> 25:47.830
We'll go to my office and
call headquarters right now.

25:49.073 --> 25:51.919
- You're a stand-up guy, Tommy.
- Ah, that's a load off my back.

25:53.402 --> 25:54.573
Yeah. Did, um...

25:54.906 --> 25:56.406
- Did you...
- No, it's done.

25:57.331 --> 25:58.907
That was really nice
of you, Tom, honestly.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.326
- Big time.
- That was big.

26:00.394 --> 26:02.197
It was very generous.

26:03.686 --> 26:06.997
Yeah. Don't mention it. Ahem.

26:12.426 --> 26:13.705
Well, I'm gonna go now.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.073
- Ok.
- Thanks again.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.774
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thank you, Tommy.

26:16.842 --> 26:18.046
Respect, brother.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.859
Dahhh!

26:23.947 --> 26:25.714
Not funny.

26:26.705 --> 26:27.816
Let's go.

26:29.567 --> 26:33.124
- Jeez. Ahh!
- Oh. Sorry.

26:34.695 --> 26:36.329
Good to see you, Tommy.

26:38.427 --> 26:39.960
What?

26:40.309 --> 26:42.962
We still got a couple
of bottles tucked away?

26:43.030 --> 26:44.096
Dry as a bone, brother.

26:44.164 --> 26:46.887
Feinberg did a sweep.
Booze, porn, all gone.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.534
That miniature, uh, of Stanley Cup
we had in the, uh...bunk room...

26:49.801 --> 26:51.769
Convinced it was a bong.

26:51.837 --> 26:53.237
Think it was at one point.

26:53.305 --> 26:54.964
And you tell me now.

26:57.914 --> 27:01.790
You know, I, um--I don't believe
your story, Tom,

27:01.910 --> 27:06.420
about what happened when you died,
how you didn't see nothing.

27:07.401 --> 27:11.418
You're lyin' to me. I was in there.
I saw you go.

27:11.538 --> 27:13.699
There was something that you saw
that scared the shit out of you,

27:13.728 --> 27:17.787
and I wanna know what that was.
Did you go to hell?

27:17.855 --> 27:22.245
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.427
Come down to the bar tonight.

27:25.494 --> 27:27.061
I wanna hear all about it.

27:42.044 --> 27:44.712
Ah, boy.

27:49.974 --> 27:51.333
Where'd you go, T?

27:54.542 --> 27:55.855
What?

27:56.153 --> 27:59.290
In the rink. When we were all
walkin' out,

28:00.346 --> 28:02.948
I had you right behind me. Next thing
I knew, I turned around, you were gone.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.990
Got all dressed up for your
welcome and everything.

28:07.380 --> 28:08.913
I brought all the guys down,

28:09.447 --> 28:12.310
which was--it was no easy production,
by the way,

28:13.166 --> 28:16.795
But, yeah, we got
all geared up, 343 of us.

28:18.067 --> 28:19.397
We were all pumped. What happened?

28:19.932 --> 28:24.669
Uh, somethin' exploded.
You guys didn't hear that, uh...

28:25.949 --> 28:26.923
What?

28:30.512 --> 28:32.204
Where did you end up?

28:32.657 --> 28:34.914
I don't know. It was like the
thing explodes,

28:34.937 --> 28:36.226
like one of them crazy dreams.

28:36.294 --> 28:38.126
Where did you end up?

28:38.145 --> 28:39.902
Hey, watch the shoulder, man.

28:40.599 --> 28:41.943
Jesus, relax.

28:44.589 --> 28:45.933
It was, uh, you know...

28:46.786 --> 28:49.370
it was a hallway somewhere
full of fire and shit.

28:50.455 --> 28:52.481
You know, the fire was Rollin'...

28:56.454 --> 28:59.589
How did it stop, Tom?
Who-- what made it stop?

29:02.629 --> 29:04.913
- Why are you makin' that face?
- How did it stop?!

29:05.033 --> 29:06.735
I woke up.

29:07.859 --> 29:09.178
You came back to life.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.176
Yeah, technically.

29:13.364 --> 29:14.647
I gotta go.

29:15.332 --> 29:16.844
What? Go where? What?

29:18.144 --> 29:20.168
You gotta do somethin'
to turn this around, brother.

29:20.436 --> 29:22.571
I-if I was you, I'd...

29:23.540 --> 29:26.778
I'd stock up on some prayer.

29:28.041 --> 29:29.986
Uh, what...Hey. J...

29:30.622 --> 29:32.285
Hey. What do you mean?!

29:38.105 --> 29:39.507
You love me?

29:40.317 --> 29:41.748
I mean, um...

29:42.962 --> 29:44.191
Yeah.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.476
Of cour... Yeah...

29:47.424 --> 29:51.374
I went to see you
the night after you got shot,

29:51.822 --> 29:54.396
when you were still touch-and-go.

29:54.809 --> 29:57.660
Nobody knew, 'cause everybody had
already left for the night,

29:57.700 --> 30:00.167
except for Mickey, who had
fallen asleep in the hallway,

30:00.235 --> 30:02.439
so I knew that I had,
like, 15 or 20 minutes.

30:02.559 --> 30:04.037
Mm-hmm.

30:04.105 --> 30:09.474
- And, you know...
- Ahh.

30:10.066 --> 30:10.658
Ohh!

30:10.686 --> 30:16.789
I just... I sat, and I... stared, you know...

30:18.745 --> 30:23.251
That machine, that really
scary breathing thing.

30:23.308 --> 30:24.149
Yeah.

30:25.585 --> 30:26.887
I figured...

30:28.752 --> 30:30.732
2 seconds to pull the plug,

30:31.484 --> 30:33.234
2 seconds to get out...

30:34.028 --> 30:36.542
5 minutes later, I'd be in the car
on the way home.

30:37.872 --> 30:39.087
And you,

30:39.723 --> 30:42.780
you would've gotten your death
wish all out of the way.

30:46.322 --> 30:51.323
I was this close to doing it.
I was in a very calm, even state.

30:52.289 --> 30:55.427
And I sat there for a couple of minutes.

30:55.803 --> 31:00.135
Well, it was 8 actually, 'cause I did check
my watch, and I wondered

31:00.944 --> 31:03.519
why I hadn't done it yet.

31:05.804 --> 31:07.409
And then I remembered.

31:08.218 --> 31:11.680
You were gonna be my second life.

31:12.577 --> 31:17.195
After 9/11, after all the grief

31:18.004 --> 31:22.243
and the big, empty hole in my heart

31:22.995 --> 31:24.730
that Jimmy left behind,

31:24.850 --> 31:27.645
you know, when he cheated
on me and then he died.

31:27.765 --> 31:30.706
Um, you were never gonna fill that.

31:30.826 --> 31:34.480
I mean, no one was, but
I thought that, um...

31:35.458 --> 31:40.519
and you led me to believe that I was
gonna have another life.

31:44.453 --> 31:49.172
I n--I never said anything.

31:49.218 --> 31:50.112
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

31:50.148 --> 31:51.113
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

31:51.593 --> 31:55.338
What--I never, ever made
any kind of a promise about...

31:57.148 --> 31:58.731
What? I didn't.

31:58.799 --> 32:01.233
Honey, you said it in the
way that you kissed me.

32:01.301 --> 32:02.201
Oh ho ho.

32:02.269 --> 32:04.807
You said it in the way
that you tore me apart.

32:06.972 --> 32:09.370
Honey, our parts fit.

32:11.422 --> 32:12.925
I love you.

32:13.841 --> 32:15.289
And I hate you.

32:16.425 --> 32:18.093
And I want you.

32:19.543 --> 32:21.423
I hope you die.

32:29.662 --> 32:33.074
Ow! Shit. Goddamn it.

32:33.194 --> 32:34.433
What the hell?

32:34.708 --> 32:38.807
I want one thing from you,
one last thing.

32:38.927 --> 32:39.920
I want Damian out.

32:40.116 --> 32:40.865
Out of what?

32:41.286 --> 32:44.501
This. The job. The calling.

32:44.569 --> 32:46.737
Are you nuts?
What about his father's legacy?

32:46.804 --> 32:48.805
His father ain't here, is he?

32:49.329 --> 32:52.365
His father only shows up in old
home movies

32:52.485 --> 32:55.285
and your goddamn fever dreams.

32:55.542 --> 32:57.414
Screw his father's legacy.

32:57.449 --> 33:01.064
I am interested in my legacy,
and I want him out now.

33:01.443 --> 33:05.833
Ok. Well, how would you propose
that I or anybody

33:05.953 --> 33:09.771
- would go about that particular--
- Couldn't care less how you do it.

33:10.060 --> 33:11.557
Just make it happen.

33:13.595 --> 33:16.906
It is the least you could do for me.

33:19.569 --> 33:23.313
Where do you get your balls big
enough to think that I owe you that?

33:24.001 --> 33:31.870
Hmm. Well, you're still
breathin', ain't ya?

33:51.710 --> 33:54.437
Heh.
Tommy Gavin, welcome back.

33:54.504 --> 33:57.473
Hi. Thank you.

33:57.540 --> 33:58.706
My pleasure.

34:12.208 --> 34:13.851
What is this?

34:13.918 --> 34:14.985
Water.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.187
Jesus Christ. Why?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.688
- You're on the no-fly list.
- What?

34:20.050 --> 34:23.766
- Hey. Cuz. How you feelin'?
- Good. What's goin' on?

34:24.012 --> 34:27.460
Hey, check this out.
What do you think? Heh heh heh.

34:27.704 --> 34:30.339
It's unbelievable. The customers
love it. It's insane.

34:30.377 --> 34:32.467
They take pictures of it.
And we got this drink.

34:32.485 --> 34:33.702
It's called the Bloodshot Mary.

34:34.121 --> 34:35.643
It's 2 shots of vodka,
one of tomato juice

34:35.674 --> 34:37.909
and an empty shell casing
dropped in the bottom.

34:38.029 --> 34:39.774
12 bucks a pop. It's unbelievable.

34:39.893 --> 34:42.532
Hey! Give me 4 of those,
uh, Bloodshot Marys!

34:42.652 --> 34:43.559
Ch-Ching.

34:43.679 --> 34:45.739
Hey, give me a vodka, will you?
Make it a double.

34:45.935 --> 34:47.493
Yeah. But I'm gonna have to
charge you first, all right?

34:52.676 --> 34:55.741
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I built this place, remember?

34:55.860 --> 34:57.603
Yeah, and I own this place literally.

34:57.723 --> 34:59.461
I took it over from you guys
to cover your ass,

34:59.503 --> 35:02.080
and in my bar, nobody drinks
for free, including the staff,

35:02.200 --> 35:03.771
and that means you and your entire crew.

35:03.891 --> 35:05.387
Ok, give me a goddamn drink, Eddie.

35:05.423 --> 35:06.947
Your job, by the way, is to
sit here at the bar,

35:06.995 --> 35:09.229
tell stories about that night,
and pose for pictures.

35:09.296 --> 35:11.026
And if you can lay down
inside the chalk outline,

35:11.067 --> 35:12.766
 I'm sure I could get like, 5 bucks a pop for those.

35:21.196 --> 35:22.584
Hey, listen.

35:24.854 --> 35:26.922
I need that goddamn
drink, all right? So just...

35:28.109 --> 35:31.104
You lay down in the outline,
I'll split the profits with you,

35:31.139 --> 35:34.416
and then you can buy your own drink.
Otherwise, water's on the house.

35:34.869 --> 35:37.453
I'm not layin' in the
goddam outline, Eddie.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.523
Start posin', pappy.
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.085
This is the guy that died.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.913
This guy right here.
Deal?

35:48.009 --> 35:49.394
Deal.

35:58.673 --> 36:00.032
Yeah.

36:01.015 --> 36:02.041
There you go.

36:10.236 --> 36:13.719
- Can we get a picture?
- Yeah. Just a second.

36:24.851 --> 36:27.454
Ladies and gentlemen, the shooter.

36:31.083 --> 36:32.680
Did you really shoot him?

36:32.800 --> 36:34.401
Yep. Twice.

36:34.468 --> 36:35.802
Why?

36:35.870 --> 36:37.447
He killed my wife.

36:40.454 --> 36:42.998
Hey, Eddie.
Where the hell did he go?

36:46.445 --> 36:47.809
I don't know.
