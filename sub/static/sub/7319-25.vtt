WEBVTT

00:11.867 --> 00:13.767
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.800 --> 00:16.167
(Miranda) YOU PEOPLE ARE TAKING
A TEST THAT WILL DETERMINE

00:16.200 --> 00:17.767
THE COURSE OF YOUR ENTIRE
MEDICAL CAREERS.
YOU WANT A BIG WEDDING?

00:17.800 --> 00:20.433
(Preston) YES.
I KNOW YOU THINK I HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU,

00:20.467 --> 00:22.433
BUT I DON'T.
(Miranda) SEARCH AND RESCUE
FOUND THOSE LOST CLIMBERS.

00:22.467 --> 00:25.067
(Richard) ONE'S STILL MISSING.
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.533
DO YOU REMEMBER?
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

00:26.567 --> 00:28.200
HE'S MAKING HIS RECOMMENDATION
TO THE BOARD TOMORROW

00:28.233 --> 00:30.300
FOR CHIEF OF SURGERY
AND CHIEF RESIDENT.

00:30.333 --> 00:33.300
(Addison) YOU'RE ADOPTING?
SHE HASN'T ACTUALLY
PICKED US YET.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.800
THIS HEARTBURN,
IT'S LIKE IT...
(Walter) OH, NO.

00:35.833 --> 00:38.600
(Nicole) FOURTH CLIMBER.
(Miranda) IS THAT
AN AX IN HIS HEAD?

00:38.633 --> 00:42.500
IF RICHARD FINDS OUT THAT YOU'RE
CARRYING ANOTHER MAN'S BABY...
SOMEBODY HELP!

00:46.433 --> 00:50.033
(Richard) BEING CHIEF
IS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY.

00:50.067 --> 00:51.800
EVERY SINGLE SURGICAL PATIENT
IN THE HOSPITAL

00:51.833 --> 00:53.333
IS YOUR PATIENT,

00:53.367 --> 00:56.300
WHETHER YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CUT THEM OPEN OR NOT.

00:56.333 --> 00:59.200
COME ON.
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.
THE SCALPEL STOPS WITH YOU.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.567
START 2 LARGE BORE I.V.s
AND BOLUS 2 LITERS L.R.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.800
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK AT A FAMILY...
READY? ONE, TWO...

01:05.833 --> 01:07.733
AND TELL THEM YOUR TEAM
DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD

01:07.767 --> 01:11.133
TO SAVE SOMEONE'S CHILD...
GET ME A STAT E.K.G.
AND A PORTABLE CHEST, BROOKE.

01:11.167 --> 01:13.767
SHE'S 34 WEEKS PREGNANT
WITH TWINS.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.267
THEIR HUSBAND...
YOU GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU GO HAVE
A SEAT IN THE WAITING ROOM?

01:17.300 --> 01:18.767
WE'RE NOT LEAVING HER.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.500
THEIR WIFE.

01:21.533 --> 01:24.467
WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I FOUND HER UNCONSCIOUS.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.700
YOU GET CAUGHT UP...

01:26.733 --> 01:29.200
TAKING CARE
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FAMILIES.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.333
SHE'S LOST BLOOD,
A-A LOT OF BLOOD.

01:31.367 --> 01:33.533
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY,
IT MAKES YOU...

01:33.567 --> 01:35.800
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.333
WHAT WAS SHE DOING HERE?

01:37.367 --> 01:40.300
YOU TAKE CARE
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FAMILIES...

01:40.333 --> 01:42.533
(monitor beeps)

01:42.567 --> 01:44.467
(Richard) AND YOU SACRIFICE
YOUR OWN.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.733
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HATE THIS PARTY GAME THING,

01:47.767 --> 01:49.833
BUT IT'S KINDA GREAT.

01:49.867 --> 01:52.700
CAN WE SET HER
ON FIRE AFTER?
NO, WE CANNOT.

01:52.733 --> 01:55.167
OKAY, THESE WEDDING VOWS
ARE NOT ALL GONNA FIT ON HERE.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.100
OKAY, THEN WRITE SMALLER.
BE STILL, PLEASE.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.267
"VOW" JUST BECAME "COW."
YOU DON'T NEED VOWS
ON YOUR HAND.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.700
WHEN YOU GET UP THERE,
JUST SPEAK FROM THE HEART.
UH, IZZIE,
THE HEART IS AN ORGAN.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.567
IT PUMPS,
IT CIRCULATES BLOOD,

02:04.600 --> 02:06.500
IT GETS CLOGGED
FROM TIME TO TIME.

02:06.533 --> 02:07.433
IT DOES NOT, HOWEVER, SPEAK.

02:07.467 --> 02:10.400
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TINY LITTLE LIPS ON IT.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.333
WELL, YOU'RE ALL
"GLASS TOTALLY EMPTY."

02:12.367 --> 02:14.233
I'M GONNA LIKE BEING MARRIED.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.167
IT'S THE WEDDING PART
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.233
(laughs)
(pagers beeping)

02:18.267 --> 02:20.200
(Callie) OH!
PARTY'S OVER.

02:20.233 --> 02:22.367
DAMN.
HEY, MINE DIDN'T GO OFF.
PIECE OF CRAP.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.700
***

02:24.733 --> 02:27.133
(sighs)
YOU CAN DO THIS, RIGHT?

02:27.167 --> 02:30.067
BECOME A PIECE OF CHATTEL?
SURE. LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.767
I MEAN, NO MATTER WHAT, YOU'RE
WALKING DOWN THAT AISLE TODAY.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.700
I NEED YOU
TO GO DOWN THAT AISLE.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.833
IS THE TOILET PAPER
CUTTING OFF YOUR CIRCULATION?

02:36.867 --> 02:38.767
YOU MARRYING BURKE,
IT'S A SIGN.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.633
IT'S A SIGN THAT PEOPLE
LIKE YOU AND ME CAN DO THIS--

02:41.667 --> 02:44.067
BE HEALTHY, BE HAPPY.

02:44.067 --> 02:47.433
YOU MARRYING BURKE
RESTORES MY FAITH IN ME.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.300
(gasps) OH, I GET IT.

02:49.333 --> 02:50.833
MY WEDDING'S ABOUT YOU.

02:50.867 --> 02:52.633
YES.
OKAY.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.733
YOU CAN DO THIS, RIGHT?
I CAN DO THIS.

02:54.767 --> 02:56.067
OKAY.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.700
HEY. THEY FOUND
THE FOURTH CLIMBER.

02:59.733 --> 03:01.633
VITALS ARE STABILIZING
AFTER FLUIDS, BUT--

03:01.667 --> 03:04.200
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.
HE WAS
ACCORDING TO HIS FRIENDS.

03:04.233 --> 03:06.533
DID THE C.T. SHOW A BLEED?
UH, WE HAVEN'T DONE
A C.T. YET.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.533
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU SAID
THERE'S A HEAD TRAUMA.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.467
YEAH, THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE HEAD TRAUMA.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.367
(Miranda)
ICE AX TO THE HEAD.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.700
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
UP ON THAT MOUNTAIN?

03:14.733 --> 03:16.667
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

03:21.467 --> 03:24.300
YOU DON'T THINK IT COULD BE
UTERINE CANCER, DO YOU?

03:24.333 --> 03:25.667
IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.300
NO, IT'S NOT...

03:28.333 --> 03:31.100
SHE WAS IN EARLIER.
SHE WAS IN A FENDER BENDER.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.367
MY WIFE CAME INTO
MY HOSPITAL,

03:33.400 --> 03:35.633
AND YOU NEGLECTED
TO TELL ME?

03:35.667 --> 03:37.133
DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY.

03:37.167 --> 03:39.467
WE'RE STILL MARRIED.
SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.400
THERE ARE MEDICAL DECISIONS
TO BE MADE.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.800
LEGALLY I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.
I HAVE A RIGHT--

03:43.833 --> 03:45.733
SHE MIGHT...

03:45.767 --> 03:47.500
BE HAVING A MISCARRIAGE.

03:47.533 --> 03:49.733
SHE'S PREGNANT.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.300
(labored breathing)

03:54.333 --> 03:56.667
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT TIME
YOUR CHEST PAIN STARTED.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.633
I DON'T KNOW.
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

03:58.667 --> 04:02.433
WHAT TIME EXACTLY?
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.200
AROUND 3:00.

04:04.233 --> 04:05.600
(sighs)

04:05.633 --> 04:08.067
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.833
I'M GONNA EXPLAIN EVERYTHING
TO YOU. I PROMISE.

04:09.867 --> 04:12.433
BUT RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO GET YOU
UP TO THE SURGICAL FLOOR.

04:12.467 --> 04:14.400
SURGERY? BUT...

04:14.433 --> 04:16.067
WHAT ABOUT MY BABIES?

04:16.100 --> 04:18.833
I THINK THOSE BABIES
ARE COMING OUT TODAY.

04:18.867 --> 04:22.533
BUT I-I HAVEN'T DECIDED.
I...

04:22.567 --> 04:27.133
I HAVEN'T CHOSEN THE PARENTS.
I NEED TIME TO DECIDE.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.400
YOU DON'T NEED TO DECIDE
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.333
RIGHT NOW
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

04:32.367 --> 04:34.600
IS MAKING SURE
THAT YOU ARE OKAY.

04:34.633 --> 04:37.600
ALL RIGHT?

04:37.633 --> 04:39.167
(siren wails)

04:39.200 --> 04:40.400
BURKE.

04:40.433 --> 04:41.767
AH, I'VE GOT A SURGERY,

04:41.800 --> 04:44.667
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE MORE THAN
FOUR HOURS, FIVE TOPS.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.333
I CAN SCRUB IN.
(Addison) HOW'S RINA?

04:46.367 --> 04:48.433
I NEED TO GET A C.T. ANGIO,

04:48.467 --> 04:50.767
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S A TEAR IN HER AORTA.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.600
HER HEART IS ABOUT TO BLOW.
MOST DISSECTING AORTAS BURST
WITHIN 48 HOURS.

04:53.633 --> 04:55.567
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
LESS THAN 12 HOURS

04:55.600 --> 04:58.300
TO FIX IT BEFORE SHE'S DEAD.
SO YOU NEED ME TO GET
THE BABIES OUT.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.500
SO I CAN SAVE HER LIFE.
YOU HAVE
AN AORTIC DISSECTION?

05:01.533 --> 05:04.700
HEY, I PROMISE I WILL MAKE IT
TO THE CHAPEL IN TIME.

05:04.733 --> 05:05.800
I...

05:05.833 --> 05:08.167
(Miranda) OKAY.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.333
LISTEN UP.

05:09.367 --> 05:11.633
UH, O'MALLEY, YOU'RE WITH
SHEPHERD AND SLOAN.

05:11.667 --> 05:14.067
STEVENS, YOU'RE WITH BURKE.
KAREV, ADDISON. GO.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.533
GREY... YOU ARE WITH
THE CHIEF'S WIFE.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.833
THE CHIEF'S WIFE?

05:17.867 --> 05:20.533
IS PREGNANT.
YES, I DID SAY PREGNANT.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.467
I RECOMMEND THAT YOU LOSE
THE SHOCKED LOOK

05:22.500 --> 05:25.200
AND TRY FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE DIGNIFIED.

05:25.233 --> 05:26.300
GO.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.667
WHO AM I ON?

05:27.700 --> 05:30.567
UH, I DIDN'T PAGE YOU.
GO HOME. GET SOME SLEEP.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.200
YEAH,
BUT I'M HERE ALREADY, SO...

05:33.233 --> 05:35.567
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.100
(Preston) GIVE US ROOM.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.833
WELL, UH,
BURKE'S GETTING MARRIED, TOO,

05:38.867 --> 05:40.767
AND HE GETS TO OPERATE.
THERE'S ONLY ONE
PRESTON BURKE.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.300
THERE'S ONLY ONE
CRISTINA YANG.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.333
I'VE GIVEN YOU THE DAY OFF,
THE WHOLE DAY.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.367
IT'S A KINDNESS. TAKE IT.
IT'S YOUR WEDDING DAY.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.800
THERE'LL ALWAYS BE
MORE SURGERIES.
BUT--

05:48.833 --> 05:50.700
REALLY, WHAT WOULD YOU
RATHER BE DOING,

05:50.733 --> 05:53.200
PREPPING A PATIENT
OR PREPPING FOR YOUR WEDDING?

05:53.233 --> 05:55.133
GO HOME.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.100

Touchstone Television

Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

06:02.567 --> 06:05.200
I NEVER GOT THE SENSE
YOU REALLY WANTED THE JOB.

06:05.233 --> 06:08.100
SEEMS TO ME YOU GOT IN THE RACE
TO PLAY OUT

06:08.133 --> 06:11.633
SOME KIND OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS
YOU HAD WITH DEREK.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.500
I WAS IN THIS TO WIN, SIR.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.667
I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S YOUR NEW CHIEF,

06:16.700 --> 06:20.467
BUT IF HE IS, HE GOT THERE
BECAUSE I MADE HIM FIGHT FOR IT.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.400
YOU MADE THEM ALL
FIGHT FOR IT.

06:22.433 --> 06:26.067
(scoffs)
SO I'M NOT GONNA BE CHIEF.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.067
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

06:28.100 --> 06:31.100
THEY RECOVERED LONNIE'S BODY?

06:31.133 --> 06:33.267
NOT HIS BODY. HE'S ALIVE.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.800
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

06:35.833 --> 06:38.400
UP THERE ON THE MOUNTAIN?

06:43.533 --> 06:46.600
W-WE'RE HALF WAY UP
THIS ICE WALL.

06:46.633 --> 06:47.667
THERE'S A...

06:47.700 --> 06:50.767
THERE'S A LEDGE A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.700
WE FIGURED
WE'D SET UP THE TENTS,

06:52.733 --> 06:55.067
WAIT OUT THE STORM.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.333
ONLY LONNIE'S INSISTING
WE GO DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.633
I TOLD HIM,
WE GOTTA DIG IN, SIT TIGHT.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.167
HE STARTED FREAKING OUT,

07:03.200 --> 07:05.267
KEEPS SAYING
DOWN'S THE WAY TO GO.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.300
AND THEN
HE STARTS CLIMBING DOWN.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.367
WE WERE TIED TOGETHER.
AND JUST LIKE THAT--
WE'RE FALLING.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.067
I SWING OUT WITH MY ICE AX,
JUST TRYING TO CATCH A ROCK.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.300
AND I CLIP LONNIE
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.067
AX JUST...

07:20.067 --> 07:22.367
SNAGS.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.700
WE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

07:26.833 --> 07:29.500
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

07:32.433 --> 07:34.200
HMM.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.133
(sighs)
(Adele) WHAT HAPPENED?

07:36.167 --> 07:39.733
YOU'VE BEEN UNCONSCIOUS
FOR A WHILE.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.667
(whispers) WHAT ABOUT...

07:41.700 --> 07:43.633
HE KNOWS.

07:43.667 --> 07:46.100
ADELE, YOU LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.300
I'M GONNA TRY TO FIND
A HEARTBEAT.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.500
YOU SHOULD PREPARE YOURSELF.

07:51.533 --> 07:54.267
(Adele sighs)

07:55.633 --> 07:57.533
(fetal heartbeat plays
over monitor)

07:57.567 --> 07:59.167
HEARTBEAT.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.067
OH!
IT'S A LITTLE SLOWER,
THAN I'D LIKE,

08:02.067 --> 08:05.633
BUT ONCE WE TANK YOU WITH
LIQUIDS AND A TRANSFUSION,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.733
IT MIGHT GET STRONGER.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.400
UM, I'VE GOTTA RUSH OFF
TO SURGERY,

08:09.433 --> 08:12.800
BUT I WILL BACK WITH YOU
THE MINUTE I'M DONE. OKAY?
THANK YOU.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.300
OKAY.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.367
(door closes)

08:17.400 --> 08:20.133
ADELE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

08:20.167 --> 08:21.767
COME ON, RICHARD.

08:21.800 --> 08:25.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU WOULD'VE DONE,

08:25.100 --> 08:27.667
CONGRATULATE ME?

08:27.700 --> 08:28.767
(sighs)

08:28.800 --> 08:31.733
I'M SURE YOU HAVE WORK
TO DO.

08:39.233 --> 08:42.167
I'M GOOD RIGHT HERE.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.533
THE PEDS RESIDENT'S ON CALL.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.467
HE'LL BE IN THE O.R.
FOR RINA'S DELIVERY.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.400
GREAT. JUST MAKE SURE
THEY NOTIFIED THE NICU.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.367
HI.
SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.533
UH, THE NURSE SAID THAT
YOU'RE DR. M-MONTGOMERY.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.467
YES. CAN I HELP YOU
WITH SOMETHING?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.667
I'M JEFF POPE.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.567
REBECCA'S HUSBAND?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.167

09:01.100 --> 09:03.233

09:48.400 --> 09:51.333
BUT IT'S YOU.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.533
I'M SO SORRY, BABY.

09:58.567 --> 10:01.233
***

10:01.267 --> 10:04.300
I SHOULD'VE NEVER
LET YOU GO.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.567
I'LL NEVER
LET YOU GO AGAIN.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.500
***

10:08.533 --> 10:09.467
HEY.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.133
I HAVE A SURGERY.

10:11.167 --> 10:12.367
I HEARD
YOU'RE THE BEST MAN.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.733
YEAH.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.667
WELL, MAID OF HONOR,
BEST MAN, KINDA PERFECT.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.133
YEAH.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.067
I KNOW I HAVEN'T
BEEN MYSELF LATELY,

10:19.100 --> 10:20.400
BUT I'M ME AGAIN,

10:20.433 --> 10:22.333
SO I WAS THINKING MAYBE
YOU SHOULD SLEEP OVER,

10:22.367 --> 10:24.800
BECAUSE THE ME THAT I AM IS
HORNY FOR THE YOU THAT YOU ARE.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.200
I MET A WOMAN LAST NIGHT.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.267
YOU MET A WOMAN LAST NIGHT?
AT JOE'S.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.800
NOTHING HAPPENED.

10:30.833 --> 10:33.033
SHE WAS PRETTY, I NOTICED,
AND WE TALKED.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.667
YOU MET A WOMAN
LAST NIGHT?
YEAH.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.600
SO SHOULD I BE WORRIED
OR SOMETHING?

10:37.633 --> 10:40.500
SHOULD YOU BE WORRIED
THAT I MET A WOMAN? NO.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.433
SHOULD YOU BE WORRIED THAT,
FOR ME,

10:42.467 --> 10:45.567
FLIRTING WITH THAT WOMAN
WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.300
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED
OR SOMETHING.

10:48.333 --> 10:49.733
***

10:53.867 --> 10:55.800
(Addison) I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOT YOU.

10:55.833 --> 10:57.500
NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT PART.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.533
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY.

10:59.567 --> 11:02.400
I NEED THIS JOB, RICHARD.
I NEED IT MORE THAN THE OTHERS.

11:02.433 --> 11:04.333
ADDISON--
NO, I NEED A REASON
TO STAY HERE.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.267
I NEED A REASON
TO GET UP IN THE MORNING.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.767
I NEED TO WAKE UP
AND NOT CARE THAT IT'S RAINING

11:08.800 --> 11:10.700
OR THAT I'M 39 AND ALONE.

11:10.733 --> 11:12.267
I NEED THE JOB, RICHARD.

11:14.267 --> 11:17.433
IF YOU NEED A JOB
TO GIVE YOU A LIFE,

11:17.467 --> 11:20.433
YOU EITHER NEED A NEW JOB
OR A NEW LIFE.

11:28.167 --> 11:32.633
I'M THINKING FOUR HOURS TOPS
TO REPAIR THIS HEART,

11:32.667 --> 11:34.133
IF ALL GOES WELL.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.767
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN, BURKE.
CRISTINA'S GREAT.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.500
SHE'S THERE, SHE'S SURE.

11:38.533 --> 11:40.433
SHE'S WILLING TO COMMIT.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.733
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

11:42.767 --> 11:44.633
AND YOU'RE NOT?

11:44.667 --> 11:47.267
THERE HE IS.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.200
T-MINUS FIVE HOURS.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.367
AND HOW'S THE BEST MAN?
UP TO THE CHALLENGE?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.300
(Preston laughs)
I WAS AN EXCELLENT
BEST MAN.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.200
YOU KNOW,
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO

11:55.233 --> 11:57.733
IS I SLEEP WITH YOUR WIFE
IN TEN YEARS.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.167
HMM. OKAY.

12:03.567 --> 12:04.733
I JUST CHECKED.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.667
CHIEF RESIDENT
HASN'T BEEN POSTED YET.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.567
UM, NO, NO. I WASN'T
LOOKING FOR CHIEF RESIDENT.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.267
YEAH, YOU WERE.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.333
(laughs) YEAH.
OKAY, I WAS.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.300
(elevator bell dings)

12:15.333 --> 12:17.267
GEORGE...

12:17.300 --> 12:18.367
HEY.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.300
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY
IS, UH, IS CRAZY.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.233
(chuckles) AND, UH,
I-I-I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.167
I-I AM SAYING THIS
AGAINST MY WILL.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.700
BECAUSE I AM
A SURGEON, OKAY?

12:25.733 --> 12:28.633
I-I-I LOVE MY JOB. I LOVE
MY LIFE EXACTLY AS IT IS.

12:28.667 --> 12:32.267
OKAY? EXACTLY AS IT IS. DO YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?
NOT REALLY.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.200
I-I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HOUSE
A HUMAN BEING

12:34.233 --> 12:36.500
IN MY BODY FOR NINE LONG MONTHS
AND THEN--AND THEN--

12:36.533 --> 12:38.267
AND THEN PUSH IT OUT
AND RAISE IT.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.167
OKAY? NONE. ZERO.
OKAY.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.100
EXCEPT HOUSING A HUMAN
FOR NINE LONG MONTHS

12:42.133 --> 12:44.067
IS ALL
THAT I CAN THINK ABOUT.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.067
IT--IT--THE THOUGHTS
ARE INVADING

12:46.100 --> 12:48.133
THE SURGERIES THAT I LOVE,
AND IT'S--IT'S--

12:48.167 --> 12:49.633
IT'S--IT'S HORMONAL.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.633
IT'S--AND HORRIBLE.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.333
BUT IT IS HAPPENING...

12:54.367 --> 12:55.533
TO ME.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.100
(laughs)

12:57.133 --> 13:00.067
YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY?

13:00.067 --> 13:01.300
APPARENTLY.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.200
THERE'S A GUY WITH AN AX
IN HIS HEAD.

13:04.233 --> 13:05.733
RIGHT. SO GO.

13:05.767 --> 13:08.567
I'M A FREAK. (chuckles)
JUST GO. JUST RUN. JUST...

13:08.600 --> 13:09.767
THANK YOU.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.833
PLEASE.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.333
GO. I'M FINE.

13:13.367 --> 13:15.633
TAKE YOUR PILL...

13:15.667 --> 13:17.333
AND DRINK YOUR WATER.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.300
RICHARD, YOU KNOW YOU WANNA
GO OUT THAT DOOR

13:19.333 --> 13:21.233
AND START BOSSING
SOME PEOPLE AROUND.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.300
TAKE YOUR PILL, ADELE.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.200
(sighs)

13:25.233 --> 13:26.800
SEE?

13:26.833 --> 13:31.067
I CAN DO MY BOSSING
RIGHT FROM THIS CHAIR.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.600
GO AHEAD, RICHARD, ASK.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.433
I KNOW YOU ARE DYING TO KNOW
WHOSE BABY TH--

13:41.467 --> 13:43.567
NOT REALLY MY PLACE.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.533
(Meredith) MRS. WEBBER...

13:45.567 --> 13:47.300
YOUR ROOM IS READY.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.100
EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO DO

13:50.133 --> 13:53.067
ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR CHIEF OF SURGERY?

13:53.067 --> 13:56.200
LOOK, I WILL BE
RIGHT BACK.

13:56.233 --> 13:59.400
I PROMISE.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.233
WE'VE MET BEFORE.

14:04.267 --> 14:06.833
YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER.

14:06.867 --> 14:10.267
YOU WERE LITTLE. OH.

14:10.300 --> 14:13.833
MY HUSBAND ALWAYS FLIRTED
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

14:13.867 --> 14:15.633
MM. OH.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.767
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE THAT, SO...

14:18.800 --> 14:20.667
I WATCHED YOU A LOT,

14:20.700 --> 14:22.400
WATCHED YOU GROW UP.

14:22.433 --> 14:23.600
YOU TURNED OUT WELL.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.567
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR MOTHER.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
I'M...

14:28.533 --> 14:31.433
SORRY ABOUT MY MOTHER, TOO.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.300
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.233
MAYBE IT WASN'T
ANYONE'S FAULT.

14:35.267 --> 14:38.233
YOU GET MARRIED AT 25
THINKING, THIS IS IT,

14:38.267 --> 14:41.067
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

14:41.067 --> 14:44.433
MAYBE THERE IS NO
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.700
(sighs)

14:46.733 --> 14:48.500
IT'S STUNNING.

14:48.533 --> 14:50.200
IT'S A LITTLE...

14:50.233 --> 14:52.133
UM, IS IT SUPPOSED
TO BE SO TIGHT?

14:52.167 --> 14:54.467
WELL, IT'S A CHOKER.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.267
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:56.300 --> 15:00.233
IT'S REALLY,
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.100
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S ME.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.467
FIVE GENERATIONS
OF BURKE WOMEN

15:04.500 --> 15:06.767
HAVE WORN THIS
ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
IT'S A WAY OF...

15:08.833 --> 15:11.700
JOINING OUR FAMILY,
BECOMING A BURKE.

15:11.733 --> 15:14.333
A BURKE.

15:14.367 --> 15:17.200
I'M AFRAID
I MISJUDGED YOU EARLY ON.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.267
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SELFISH.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.633
BUT YOU'VE GIVEN WAY

15:20.667 --> 15:23.067
TO PRESTON'S IDEAS
ABOUT THE WEDDING,

15:23.100 --> 15:25.800
AND YOU'VE BEEN FLEXIBLE
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE...

15:25.833 --> 15:28.633
MOST IMPORTANT TO HIM.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.467
AND THAT IS WONDERFUL.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.667
OH! IT'S JUST...

15:34.233 --> 15:38.400
WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING TO DO
ABOUT YOUR EYEBROWS?

15:38.433 --> 15:40.533
N-NOTHING.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.167
UH-HUH.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.100
(Addison) HOW'S SHE DOING?

15:45.133 --> 15:47.100
(Preston)
B.P.'s 92 OVER 56.

15:47.133 --> 15:50.067
HOW'D THE REUNION GO
WITH JANE DOE'S HUSBAND?
WHATEVER.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.633
HE CRIED LIKE A BABY.
SHE LOOKED BORED.

15:52.667 --> 15:55.667
DON'T GO OVERBOARD
WITH COMPASSION, KAREV.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.467
SHE'S NOT EVEN SURE IF
SHE WANTS TO STAY WITH THE GUY.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.367
IT'S COMPLICATED
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY...
COMPLICATED.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.300
THEY'RE MARRIED.
SHE TOOK A VOW.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.800
YOU DON'T MESS WITH VOWS.
MARRIED IS MARRIED.

16:04.833 --> 16:09.067
GAME OVER.
SO FREAKIN' OVER.

16:09.067 --> 16:12.500
JUST AN OPINION.
PRESSURE'S DROPPED TO 60.

16:12.533 --> 16:15.067
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.
ADDISON, HOW MUCH LONGER?
RUPTURING THE MEMBRANE NOW.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.500
I JUST NEED TWO MINUTES
TO GET THESE BABIES OUT.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.600
MAKE IT ONE. SHE'S FLATLINED.
STEVENS, START COMPRESSIONS.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.567
GOT THE FIRST ONE OUT.
CLAMP.
(baby crying)

16:21.600 --> 16:25.200
COME ON, COME ON.
SECOND BABY'S OUT.
OKAY, GO.

16:25.233 --> 16:27.267
BOKI, 10-BLADE.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.100
(monitor beeping erratically)

16:29.133 --> 16:33.133
POOR GUY... HE JUST WANTED
TO CLIMB A MOUNTAIN,

16:33.167 --> 16:35.667
AND HE ENDS UP
WITH AN AX IN HIS HEAD.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.567
WELL, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED
TURNING BACK.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.500
THE GROUP IS GOING UP,
YOU MOVE WITH THE GROUP.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.667
OKAY, DRILL, PLEASE.
HE PANICKED.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.633
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO TURN BACK
IF YOU'RE SCARED.
NO, YOU DON'T.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.567
YOU CHOSE TO CLIMB A MOUNTAIN.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.300
YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLIMB.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.833
(whirring)

16:51.867 --> 16:53.700
OKAY.
(George) NOW WE PULL IT OUT?

16:53.733 --> 16:56.733
AH, YEAH, BUT THE AX
WENT IN AS THEY FELL,

16:56.767 --> 16:58.600
SO THERE WILL BE
SOME TEARING,

16:58.633 --> 17:01.333
IT SHOULD BE A SHALLOW WOUND,
AND IT SHOULD COME OUT EASILY.

17:01.367 --> 17:03.400
YOU GOT IT?

17:03.433 --> 17:07.400
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
HERE WE GO. READY?

17:07.433 --> 17:09.567
OKAY, ONE, TWO...

17:09.600 --> 17:11.200
THREE.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.233
THAT'S STRANGE.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.067
ONE...

17:19.067 --> 17:21.733
TWO...

17:21.767 --> 17:23.133
THREE!

17:27.300 --> 17:29.567
THAT'S A CLEAN CUT.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.133
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THERE WAS GONNA BE TEARING.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.767
I KNOW.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.700
YOU ARE A LUCKY GUY.

17:36.733 --> 17:40.167
YEAH. OR THE AX DIDN'T
GO IN THERE BY ACCIDENT.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.633
(Richard)
IT'S PROBABLY UNFAIR,

17:48.667 --> 17:51.533
BUT I HOLD YOU
TO A HIGHER STANDARD.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.067
AND YOU LET ME DOWN
THIS YEAR, PRESTON.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.700
AFTER YOU GOT SHOT,
THE TREMOR...

17:57.733 --> 18:01.600
THIS JOB IS ABOUT
MAKING THE TOUGH CALLS.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.500
SOMETIMES THE TOUGHEST CALL
YOU CAN MAKE

18:03.533 --> 18:06.233
IS ADMITTING WHEN YOU'RE IN
OVER YOUR HEAD.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.067
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.767
YOU KNOW A LOT, PRESTON.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.767
YOU'RE ONE OF
THE BEST SURGEONS I KNOW...

18:13.800 --> 18:17.133
ONE OF THE BEST MEN.

18:17.167 --> 18:20.100
BUT YOU'RE NOT PERFECT.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.700
YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

18:27.367 --> 18:31.333
I WANT TO GIVE YOU
THE JOB.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.300
I WANT TO.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.067
BUT I CAN'T.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.700
PRESTON.

18:43.733 --> 18:47.600
I HAVE A WEDDING TO GET TO.

18:47.633 --> 18:50.400
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:50.433 --> 18:52.367
(Addison) YEAH.
THE BABIES ARE DOING GREAT.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.067
THEY'RE IN THE NICU.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.833
HOW ARE YOU DOING
UP THERE, PRESTON?

18:55.867 --> 18:57.200
CLOSE CALL,
BUT SHE'S STABILIZED.

18:57.233 --> 18:59.067
GOOD WORK, DR. BURKE.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.233
WE MAY ACTUALLY GET YOU
TO THE CHURCH ON TIME.

19:01.267 --> 19:03.067
YOU NERVOUS?

19:03.067 --> 19:04.833
NO, NOT REALLY.
MORE, UH...

19:04.867 --> 19:07.267
EXCITED.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.633
(Addison) HMM.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.167
UM, EXCEPT BY MY VOWS.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.500
I WROTE THEM MYSELF,
AND...

19:12.533 --> 19:16.067
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY MAY BE TOO...

19:16.067 --> 19:17.833
I WANT 'EM TO BE RIGHT.

19:17.867 --> 19:20.367
WELL, LET'S HEAR 'EM.
WHAT, NOW?

19:20.400 --> 19:24.700
HEY, YOU'VE GOT A ROOM FULL
OF WOMEN. TRY IT OUT ON US.

19:31.833 --> 19:34.400
CRISTINA...

19:34.433 --> 19:36.567
I COULD PROMISE...

19:36.600 --> 19:38.300
(sighs)

19:38.333 --> 19:41.067
TO HOLD YOU...

19:41.067 --> 19:43.067
AND TO CHERISH YOU.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.633
I COULD PROMISE TO BE THERE
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.633
I COULD SAY...

19:49.667 --> 19:52.533
TILL DEATH DO US PART.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.667
BUT I WON'T.

19:54.700 --> 19:58.300
THOSE VOWS ARE FOR...

19:58.333 --> 20:00.233
OPTIMISTIC COUPLES,

20:00.267 --> 20:02.200
THE ONES FULL OF HOPE.

20:02.233 --> 20:05.267
AND I DO NOT STAND HERE
ON MY WEDDING DAY

20:05.300 --> 20:08.767
OPTIMISTIC
OR FULL OF HOPE.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.067
OKAY, UM...

20:11.100 --> 20:13.667
I AM NOT OPTIMISTIC.

20:13.700 --> 20:16.533
I AM NOT HOPEFUL.

20:16.567 --> 20:19.567
I AM SURE.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.300
I AM STEADY.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.800
I KNOW.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.167
***

20:26.200 --> 20:29.033
I AM A HEART MAN.

20:29.067 --> 20:31.500
I TAKE 'EM APART.

20:31.533 --> 20:33.800
I PUT 'EM BACK TOGETHER.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.067
I HOLD THEM IN MY HANDS.

20:37.100 --> 20:40.700
I AM A HEART MAN.

20:40.733 --> 20:45.267
SO OF THIS I AM SURE...

20:45.300 --> 20:48.800
YOU ARE MY PARTNER...

20:48.833 --> 20:51.067
MY LOVER...

20:51.100 --> 20:53.833
MY VERY BEST FRIEND.

20:53.867 --> 20:57.100
MY HEART--MY HEART--
BEATS FOR YOU.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.700
AND ON THIS DAY,

20:58.733 --> 21:01.367
THE DAY OF OUR WEDDING,

21:01.400 --> 21:03.767
I PROMISE YOU THIS...

21:03.800 --> 21:09.100
I PROMISE YOU TO LAY MY HEART
IN THE PALM OF YOUR HANDS.

21:09.133 --> 21:11.133
***

21:11.167 --> 21:13.633
I PROMISE YOU... ME.

21:13.667 --> 21:18.667
***

21:18.700 --> 21:21.133
(sighs)

21:21.167 --> 21:23.800
TOO TRITE?
BECAUSE I CAN REWRITE IT--

21:23.833 --> 21:25.667
NO.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.200
NO. IT'S...

21:28.233 --> 21:32.133
I THINK I SPEAK FOR...

21:32.167 --> 21:35.767
EVERY WOMAN IN THIS ROOM
WHEN I SAY DUMP HER.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.833
DUMP YANG AND MARRY ME.

21:37.867 --> 21:40.267
(laughs)

21:40.300 --> 21:42.233
(chuckles)

21:42.267 --> 21:43.600
(Preston laughs)

21:43.633 --> 21:46.400
***

21:46.433 --> 21:47.600
(George) HEY.

21:47.633 --> 21:49.533
***

21:49.567 --> 21:50.333
HEY.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.600
HEY. OH, GOD.
DID I MISS A PAGE?

21:52.633 --> 21:54.533
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.333
(clears throat)

21:56.367 --> 21:58.067
(sighs)

21:58.067 --> 21:59.233
WHAT?

21:59.267 --> 22:01.367
IS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?

22:01.400 --> 22:03.300
(sighs)

22:03.333 --> 22:06.800
'CAUSE IF IT'S REALLY
WHAT YOU WANT, WE COULD DO IT.

22:06.833 --> 22:09.467
***

22:09.500 --> 22:10.700
REALLY?

22:10.733 --> 22:14.100
YEAH.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.067
OKAY, WAIT. REALLY?

22:16.067 --> 22:17.333
REALLY.

22:17.367 --> 22:19.500
OH, MY GOD. (laughs)
OH, MY GOD. REALLY?

22:19.533 --> 22:21.333
REALLY.

22:21.367 --> 22:24.267
***

22:28.600 --> 22:30.567
***

22:30.600 --> 22:32.433
SHE LOOKS LIKE REBECCA.

22:32.467 --> 22:35.767
WELL, AT LEAST WHAT
REBECCA USED TO LOOK LIKE.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.567
BUT STILL...

22:38.600 --> 22:40.233
AROUND THE EYES.

22:40.267 --> 22:41.433
YEAH.

22:41.467 --> 22:44.100
I THOUGHT I'D GIVE HER
SOME SPACE.

22:44.133 --> 22:47.300
SHE SEEMED
A LITTLE OVERWHELMED.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.633
(baby cooing)

22:50.667 --> 22:53.667
THE FERRY CRASH
WAS ON THE NEWS EVERYWHERE.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.333
YOUR WIFE GOES MISSING...

22:56.367 --> 22:59.633
HOW COULD YOU
NOT LOOK FOR HER?

22:59.667 --> 23:03.233
I THOUGHT SHE LEFT ME.

23:03.267 --> 23:05.167
WE GOT INTO A FIGHT
THAT NIGHT.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.800
SHE WAS TRYING TO TELL ME
HOW UNHAPPY SHE WAS AND...

23:08.833 --> 23:12.633
I SHUT HER DOWN.

23:12.667 --> 23:15.533
YEAH, I DIDN'T LOOK FOR HER
WHEN SHE WAS MISSING,

23:15.567 --> 23:17.533
BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS...

23:17.567 --> 23:20.467
I DIDN'T SEE HER
WHEN SHE WAS THERE.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.733
I CAN'T IMAGINE

23:21.767 --> 23:24.267
WHAT IT MUST HAVE
BEEN LIKE FOR HER,

23:24.300 --> 23:27.167
WHAT HER FACE MUST HAVE
LOOKED LIKE ALL BROKEN.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.133
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

23:29.167 --> 23:33.133
***

23:33.167 --> 23:35.800
(grunts)

23:35.833 --> 23:38.800
I... I LOVE HER.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.467
YOU KNOW?

23:40.500 --> 23:43.433
***

23:55.867 --> 23:57.800
MEREDITH.

23:57.833 --> 24:00.700
(laughs) OH.
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE--

24:00.733 --> 24:03.067
DEREK MET A GIRL...

24:03.100 --> 24:04.567
IN A BAR.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.467
AND HE FLIRTED WITH HER.
AND HE TOLD ME.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.267
YOU KNOW, NO BIG DEAL.
JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD KNOW.
MEREDITH.

24:10.300 --> 24:11.467
I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.133
HE DIDN'T EVEN HINT.
HE JUST FLAT OUT TOLD ME.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.067
MEREDITH, YOU KNOW HOW
SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT YOU,

24:16.100 --> 24:17.833
AND SOMETIMES IT'S ABOUT ME?

24:17.867 --> 24:19.767
THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY ABOUT ME.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.067
WHOA.

24:21.067 --> 24:23.633
MAMA TOOK MY EYEBROWS.

24:23.667 --> 24:27.700
SHE TOOK MY EYEBROWS,
AND NOW I AM A BURKE.

24:31.333 --> 24:34.500
LONNIE'S STABLE...

24:34.533 --> 24:37.333
BUT THE DAMAGE HE SUSTAINED
IS SIGNIFICANT.

24:37.367 --> 24:39.367
BUT IS HE GONNA WAKE UP?

24:39.400 --> 24:42.300
DO YOU WANT HIM TO?
WHAT?

24:42.333 --> 24:45.200
THE AX IN HIS HEAD
WAS PUT THERE DELIBERATELY.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.067
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE
YOU THREE GUYS

24:47.100 --> 24:50.067
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

24:53.267 --> 24:54.700
IT WASN'T--
SHUT UP, ANDY.

24:54.733 --> 24:57.467
BUT WE CAN'T JUST SIT HERE--
I SAID SHUT UP, ANDY.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.367
IS THAT HOW YOU LET HIM
TALK TO YOU AT 14,000 FEET?

25:00.400 --> 25:03.100
I HAVE TO TALK TO HIS FAMILY.

25:03.133 --> 25:05.067
YOU GUYS CAN TALK TO THE COPS.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.800
(elevator bell dings)

25:11.833 --> 25:14.233
(Meredith) DR. BAILEY.

25:14.267 --> 25:16.367
YEAH. WHAT?

25:16.400 --> 25:19.500
CRISTINA
NEEDS TO CUT SOMETHING.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.433
I CAN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT

25:21.467 --> 25:23.467
IN A WAY
THAT WON'T MAKE YOU GLARE.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.800
BUT...
THEY TOOK HER EYEBROWS

25:25.833 --> 25:27.700
AND THEY CALLED HER A BURKE.

25:27.733 --> 25:30.467
SHE REALLY NEEDS
TO CUT SOMEBODY OPEN.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.133
YANG...

25:32.167 --> 25:34.367
GO... DO...
GETTING MARRIED THINGS.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.800
GET OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL.

25:37.833 --> 25:39.467
HEY!

25:39.500 --> 25:41.133
(elevator bell dings)

25:41.167 --> 25:43.567
I MEAN... HEY.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.267
I...

25:45.300 --> 25:47.433
YOU HAVE TO LET ME CUT,

25:47.467 --> 25:50.133
BECAUSE I AM STANDING HERE
EYEBROWLESS

25:50.167 --> 25:51.333
WITH NO DIGNITY LEFT.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.267
I AM A SURGEON, DR. BAILEY.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.200
BUT RIGHT NOW
I DON'T FEEL LIKE ONE.

25:55.233 --> 25:59.400
I FEEL... LIKE...

25:59.433 --> 26:01.767
SOMEBODY ELSE.

26:01.800 --> 26:05.667
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE,
NOT TO FEEL LIKE YOURSELF?

26:10.400 --> 26:12.400
YEAH.

26:12.433 --> 26:13.767
OH!
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:13.800 --> 26:15.600
OH!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:15.633 --> 26:18.100
SHE STARTED CRAMPING AND THEN
SHE GOT REALLY DIAPHORETIC.

26:18.133 --> 26:20.500
ALERT O.B. TO A POSSIBLE D&C

26:20.533 --> 26:22.467
DUE TO
AN INCOMPLETE MISCARRIAGE.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.567
OH!
ADELE, YOU COULD HAVE

26:24.600 --> 26:26.567
A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION
DUE TO THE TRAUMA.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.633
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU
TO INTO AN O.R. NOW.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.333
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE!

26:30.367 --> 26:31.533
(whimpers) OH!

26:31.567 --> 26:34.067
(groans)

26:38.300 --> 26:42.100
SIR, DR. SHEPHERD IS HERE.

26:42.133 --> 26:45.067
(Derek clears throat)
THANK YOU.

26:46.433 --> 26:49.200
RICHARD, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO...

26:49.233 --> 26:52.067
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS TODAY.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.800
YES, I DO.

26:59.467 --> 27:00.800
(sighs)

27:00.833 --> 27:03.567
SHE WENT INTO EARLY D.I.C.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.433
I GAVE HER BLOOD,
PLATELETS, F.F.P,

27:06.467 --> 27:09.333
PREGNANCY AT 52 IS DANGEROUS.

27:09.367 --> 27:12.200
I TRIED EVERYTHING.
I COULDN'T SAVE...

27:27.300 --> 27:28.700
OH!

27:28.733 --> 27:32.333
OH. I THOUGHT...

27:32.367 --> 27:35.067
I THOUGHT...

27:35.100 --> 27:37.400
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.467
UM...

27:41.500 --> 27:45.433
DO YOU WANT TO...
CALL SOMEBODY?

27:45.467 --> 27:46.633
I CAN...

27:46.667 --> 27:48.367
NO, NO ONE.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.400
WELL, THE FATHER OF THE BABY,
MAYBE YOU WANT TO--

27:51.433 --> 27:54.067
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT.
I DIDN'T TELL HIM.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.800
I, UM...

27:55.833 --> 27:58.800
I THINK I MISJUDGED HIM.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.200
I THOUGHT HE'D GO RUNNING
FOR THE HILLS.

28:01.233 --> 28:04.567
BUT ACTUALLY...

28:04.600 --> 28:08.367
HE'S A MUCH BETTER MAN
THAN I THOUGHT.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.300
HE'LL GET OVER
HIS INITIAL JUDGMENTS,

28:10.333 --> 28:11.767
AND HE'LL...

28:11.800 --> 28:15.067
SIT WITH YOU...

28:15.067 --> 28:18.433
AND HE'LL MAKE YOU DRINK
YOUR WATER.

28:23.767 --> 28:25.800
(sobs)

28:25.833 --> 28:27.067
ADELE...

28:27.067 --> 28:29.667
IT WAS A BOY.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.567
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.367
ALL RIGHT, DR. LEONARD,

28:40.400 --> 28:42.433
WOULD YOU PLEASE CLOSE
FOR DR. BURKE?

28:42.467 --> 28:45.067
HE HAS A WEDDING TO GET TO.

28:45.067 --> 28:47.200
(Miranda) ONE CUT,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONE.

28:47.233 --> 28:49.167
ONE.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.100
BUT--BUT I STILL HAVE TO--
COME ON.

28:51.133 --> 28:53.133
YOU WANT YOUR BRIDE
WAITING FOR YOU AT THE ALTAR?

28:53.167 --> 28:54.800
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.
LET'S GO.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.700
(Meredith) WE GOTTA GO NOW,
CRISTINA.

28:57.733 --> 28:59.267
GREY.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.200
PUT THE SCALPEL DOWN,
CRISTINA.

29:01.233 --> 29:04.133
***

29:06.333 --> 29:09.833
(Meredith) YOU CAN STILL
DO THIS, RIGHT?

29:09.867 --> 29:13.067
***

29:15.500 --> 29:16.633
WHAT?

29:16.667 --> 29:19.500
UH, HOLD ON A MINUTE.

29:19.533 --> 29:23.133
***

29:23.167 --> 29:25.833
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
NO ONE'S AROUND

29:25.867 --> 29:27.767
SO I CAN SAY THIS.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.167
I THINK WE'VE SAID EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO SAY.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.600
SHUT UP.
I AM AN OPTIMIST.

29:32.633 --> 29:35.233
I AM HOPEFUL.

29:35.267 --> 29:37.367
I AM NOT SURE.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.300
LOOK, I CAN DO THIS MYSELF.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.367
LET ME SPEAK.

29:41.400 --> 29:46.167
BECAUSE I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND
AND BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,

29:46.200 --> 29:49.067
IF WHAT YOU WANT
IS TO BE WITH CALLIE,

29:49.067 --> 29:52.667
THEN I WILL DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO SUPPORT YOU

29:52.700 --> 29:55.600
AND HELP YOU
MAKE YOUR MARRIAGE WORK.

29:55.633 --> 29:57.533
***

29:57.567 --> 30:00.033
BUT BECAUSE
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND

30:00.067 --> 30:03.733
AND BECAUSE I LOVE YOU...

30:03.767 --> 30:08.433
I ALSO HAVE TO SAY...

30:08.467 --> 30:11.300
THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

30:11.333 --> 30:15.200
***

30:15.233 --> 30:18.200
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.100
I CAN'T PROMISE THE FUTURE,

30:20.133 --> 30:22.200
I CAN'T PROMISE PERFECTION

30:22.233 --> 30:24.700
BECAUSE WE'RE US
AND I'M ME

30:24.733 --> 30:28.433
AND WHO KNOWS
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.700
BUT IN MY HEART...

30:30.733 --> 30:33.133
I AM SURE.

30:33.167 --> 30:35.267
***

30:35.300 --> 30:38.033
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU,
GEORGE.

30:38.067 --> 30:41.133
AND I HOPE
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME, TOO.

30:41.167 --> 30:44.700
***

30:44.733 --> 30:47.733
SAY SOMETHING.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.667
WHAT TIME IS IT?
YOU GOT 30 MINUTES.

30:49.700 --> 30:53.467
OH, CRAP. I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR MY OWN WEDDING.
(Meredith) NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:57.233 --> 31:00.100
DR. BURKE ASKED ME
TO CHECK ON YOU.

31:00.133 --> 31:01.767
LET'S SEE. YOUR, UM...

31:01.800 --> 31:03.833
YOUR POST-OP X-RAYS
LOOK GOOD.

31:03.867 --> 31:05.800
WE'LL DISCUSS RELEASING YOU.

31:05.833 --> 31:07.600
ANY CHANGE IN LONNIE?
ANDY?

31:07.633 --> 31:10.167
WHO ARE YOU?
HE'S MY LAWYER.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.433
THAT WAS FAST.

31:12.467 --> 31:14.467
DON'T YOU DARE JUDGE ME.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.300
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.367
WE THOUGHT...
HE WAS ALMOST DEAD.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.633
NO WAY HE WAS GONNA MAKE IT.

31:21.667 --> 31:24.500
HE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN.

31:26.367 --> 31:29.167
SO I...

31:29.200 --> 31:30.633
PICKED IT UP...

31:30.667 --> 31:32.267
ANDY, SHUT UP.
NO!

31:32.300 --> 31:34.167
I'M NOT GONNA SHUT UP.

31:36.867 --> 31:40.333
I PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.

31:42.300 --> 31:46.233
AND IF I WAS BACK THERE
RIGHT NOW...

31:46.267 --> 31:49.167
I'D DO THE SAME THING.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.167
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.767
HE IS MY FRIEND.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.667
(voice breaks) I PUT HIM
OUT OF HIS MISERY.

31:58.700 --> 32:02.667
(sniffles)

32:02.700 --> 32:04.267
ANYONE GOT ANY DEODORANT?

32:04.300 --> 32:06.600
UM, YOU'RE NOT PUTTING MY
DEODORANT IN YOUR HAIRY ARMPITS.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.400
DON'T MOVE.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A UNIBROW.

32:08.433 --> 32:11.067
AND I HAVE SOME
IN MY LOCKER.
UH, CLOSED? OPEN?

32:11.067 --> 32:14.667
(Meredith) CLOSED.
PERFECT. DASHING.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.567
THANKS.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.833
MOMENT OF TRUTH, PEOPLE.
(Alex) THOSE OUR SCORES?

32:18.867 --> 32:20.433
GREY.

32:20.467 --> 32:22.833
KAREV. YANG.
THANK YOU.

32:22.867 --> 32:24.367
STEVENS. O'MALLEY.

32:26.767 --> 32:29.400
YES. THANK GOD.

32:29.433 --> 32:32.467
DID YOU PASS?
YOU BET YOUR MARRIED BOOTY,
I DID.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.767
***

32:34.800 --> 32:37.633
HOW'D YOU DO? DID YOU PASS?
YEAH.

32:37.667 --> 32:40.600
I'LL TALK TO YOU
AT THE CHURCH.
OKAY.

32:40.633 --> 32:42.833
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

32:42.867 --> 32:45.133
(Derek) EXCUSE ME.

32:45.167 --> 32:46.733
(Cristina) MEREDITH.

32:46.767 --> 32:49.533
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CHAPEL.
IZ, WILL YOU TAKE THE DRESS?

32:49.567 --> 32:51.333
YES.
OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

32:51.367 --> 32:52.667
OKAY.

32:52.700 --> 32:57.500
***

32:57.533 --> 32:59.300
I LIKE THE SUIT.

32:59.333 --> 33:02.700
THE SUIT IS WAY BETTER
THAN THE SCRUBS.
THANKS.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.833
HEY, UH, I PASSED
MY INTERN EXAM.

33:04.867 --> 33:06.067
GOOD!
YEAH.

33:06.100 --> 33:07.533
THAT'S GOOD.

33:07.567 --> 33:10.333
***

33:10.367 --> 33:13.767
WE GOT DISCHARGED,
ME AND THE BABY.

33:15.733 --> 33:18.600
OH, COME ON, YOU JUST--
YOU JUST HAD BRAIN SURGERY.

33:18.633 --> 33:20.500
YOU'RE STILL--YOU'RE STILL
ON ANTIBIOTICS.

33:20.533 --> 33:23.833
MY BODY'S BEEN SIGNED OFF ON
BY... PLASTICS, CARDIO,

33:23.867 --> 33:26.200
ORTHOPEDICS, NEURO AND O.B.,
AND MY--

33:26.233 --> 33:29.067
AND ALSO, MY TEETH
GOT THE BLESSING FROM--

33:29.100 --> 33:30.833
WAIT, I CAN SAY THIS--
PROSTHODONTICS.

33:30.867 --> 33:32.800
YEAH, BUT THERE'S STILL
YOUR MEMORY--

33:32.833 --> 33:34.667
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW
MY MEMORY'S FINE?

33:34.700 --> 33:36.633
BECAUSE I CAN SAY
PROSTHODONTICS.
YEAH, BUT THE BABY--

33:36.667 --> 33:39.133
DISCHARGED, BY PEDS.
YEAH, BUT--

33:39.167 --> 33:43.400
***

33:46.067 --> 33:47.800
I HAVE EVERY REASON TO GO.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.333
AND--AND YEAH, I'M SCARED.

33:49.367 --> 33:52.500
AND YEAH, THIS IS--THIS IS
MOVING AT WARP SPEED.

33:52.533 --> 33:54.433
AND YEAH, I'M FREAKING OUT,
BUT JEFF IS GOOD.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.400
AND--AND JEFF IS
THE FATHER OF MY CHILD.

33:56.433 --> 33:59.300
THE MAN IS OUT BUYING
A CAR SEAT RIGHT NOW.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.333
AND THE MINUTE
HE GETS BACK...

34:01.367 --> 34:02.833
***

34:02.867 --> 34:05.067
I-I HAVE EVERY REASON TO GO,

34:05.067 --> 34:07.333
BECAUSE MEDICALLY...

34:07.367 --> 34:10.667
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR ME TO STAY.

34:10.700 --> 34:12.600
MEDICALLY.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.567
OH.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.533
YEAH. OKAY.

34:16.567 --> 34:18.467
WELL, THEN I'LL JUST CHECK
THE CHART.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.367
DAMN IT.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.200
WE GOT, UH... WHAT?

34:22.233 --> 34:23.233
ARE YOU... (stammers)

34:23.267 --> 34:26.300
DO I--DO I HAVE TO SPELL
EVERYTHING OUT FOR YOU?

34:26.333 --> 34:29.200
I MEAN, DID--DID YOU SNIFF
TOO MUCH GLUE AS A CHILD?

34:29.233 --> 34:31.633
I'M ASKING YOU SOMETHING HERE.

34:31.667 --> 34:33.567
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

34:33.600 --> 34:36.500
I WANT...

34:36.533 --> 34:40.367
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME
A REASON TO STAY...

34:40.400 --> 34:43.233
A REAL REASON.

34:43.267 --> 34:45.200
I MEAN, JEFF'S--

34:45.233 --> 34:48.133
JEFF'S A DECENT GUY,
A GOOD, DECENT GUY.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.100
BUT TO HIM, I'M REBECCA,

34:50.133 --> 34:55.367
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I AM
REBECCA ANYMORE AND...

34:55.400 --> 34:56.733
YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNEW--

34:56.767 --> 34:59.600
YOU KNEW WHEN I COULDN'T
EVEN SPEAK WHO I WAS.

34:59.633 --> 35:01.767
YOU... YOU NAMED ME AVA,

35:01.800 --> 35:04.800
AND I WAS MORE ME AS AVA

35:04.833 --> 35:07.567
THEN I'LL EVER BE AS REBECCA.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.333
LOOK, I-I HAVE EVERY REASON
TO GO BACK TO MY LIFE.

35:12.367 --> 35:15.333
AND I WILL.

35:15.367 --> 35:18.600
UNLESS... YOU...

35:18.633 --> 35:20.633
***

35:20.667 --> 35:23.500
ALEX, I'M ASKING YOU TO GIVE ME
A REASON TO STAY HERE...

35:23.533 --> 35:25.700
A REASON FROM YOU.

35:25.733 --> 35:29.200
***

35:29.233 --> 35:30.567
JEFF LOVES YOU.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.133
HE'S A...
HE'S A DECENT GUY.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.233
ALEX, GIVE ME A REASON.

35:35.267 --> 35:38.167
***

35:46.633 --> 35:50.733
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY
WITH THE DECENT GUY.

35:50.767 --> 35:55.233
***

36:00.467 --> 36:02.367
IF YOU WANT TO BREAK UP
WITH ME

36:02.400 --> 36:04.633
SO YOU CAN SEE OTHER WOMEN,
JUST DO IT.

36:04.667 --> 36:06.567
DON'T TELL ME YOU MET
ANOTHER WOMAN.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.500
JUST END IT
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.400
I CAN'T.
SURE YOU CAN.

36:10.433 --> 36:11.767
HERE'S HOW IT GOES--

36:11.800 --> 36:14.767
MEREDITH, I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU ANYMORE.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.700
MEREDITH,
I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.

36:16.733 --> 36:18.300
MEREDITH...

36:18.333 --> 36:20.267
***

36:20.300 --> 36:22.467
I DO LOVE YOU.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.200
DON'T YOU SEE?

36:25.233 --> 36:28.600
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

36:28.633 --> 36:31.467
YOU'RE THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.133
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU.

36:34.167 --> 36:36.333
BUT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY
LEAVING ME.

36:36.367 --> 36:39.233
YOU WALK AWAY WHEN YOU WANT,
YOU COME BACK WHEN YOU WANT.

36:39.267 --> 36:42.300
NOT EVERYONE,
NOT YOUR FRIENDS,

36:42.333 --> 36:44.833
BUT YOU LEAVE ME.

36:44.867 --> 36:47.367
***

36:47.400 --> 36:49.733
SO I'M ASKING YOU...

36:49.767 --> 36:51.667
IF YOU DON'T SEE
A FUTURE FOR US,

36:51.700 --> 36:54.500
IF YOU AREN'T IN THIS...

36:54.533 --> 36:56.833
PLEASE...

36:56.867 --> 36:58.700
PLEASE JUST END IT,
BECAUSE I CAN'T.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.367
I'M IN IT.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.467
PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY.

37:04.500 --> 37:08.733
***

37:08.767 --> 37:11.100
I... I CAN'T.

37:11.133 --> 37:13.367
I-I--
CRISTINA IS GETTING MARRIED.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.133
I HAVE TO GO
MAKE SURE SHE GETS MARRIED.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.200
MEREDITH...

37:18.233 --> 37:21.833
I REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE
SHE GETS DOWN THAT AISLE.

37:21.867 --> 37:24.400
LET'S GO.
WE'RE RUNNING LATE.

37:24.433 --> 37:27.433
***

37:39.467 --> 37:40.633
(Preston) YOU OKAY?

37:40.667 --> 37:44.067
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.700
YOU NEED ANYTHING?

37:45.733 --> 37:48.567
NEED A MINT, HUH?
A GETAWAY CAR?

37:48.600 --> 37:51.467
IF IT'S THE CHIEF THING,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.667
YOU DESERVE IT.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.533
RICHARD DIDN'T PICK ME
TO BE CHIEF.

37:55.567 --> 37:58.433
WE ALL ASSUMED YOU...

37:58.467 --> 38:00.433
WELL, WHO DID HE PICK?

38:00.467 --> 38:03.067
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WASN'T ME.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.400
YOU REALLY DON'T...

38:05.433 --> 38:07.067
LOOK SO GOOD.

38:07.100 --> 38:10.233
MEREDITH AND I
MAY NOT MAKE IT.

38:10.267 --> 38:13.767
I THINK I WANT IT
MORE THAN SHE DOES.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.667
BUT TODAY'S YOUR DAY.
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU TODAY.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.533
YOU REALLY ARE
A GOOD BEST MAN.

38:18.567 --> 38:21.233
I TRY.
(knock on door)

38:21.267 --> 38:22.467
CRISTINA.

38:26.367 --> 38:27.800
CRISTINA?

38:27.833 --> 38:30.267
I DIDN'T RUN.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.300
OH!

38:33.333 --> 38:35.733
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

38:35.767 --> 38:37.700
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.833
THANK YOU.

38:39.867 --> 38:41.500
FRANKLY, I ALWAYS FEARED

38:41.533 --> 38:45.200
YOU WERE TOO EMOTIONALLY STUNTED
TO SETTLE DOWN.

38:45.233 --> 38:46.333
OH! (laughs)

38:46.367 --> 38:49.067
(gritting teeth)
YOU CAN DO THIS.

38:49.100 --> 38:50.800
***

38:50.833 --> 38:52.433
I'VE ALWAYS
FOUND IT CONFUSING.

38:52.467 --> 38:55.067
IF YOU KNOW BOTH THE BRIDE
AND THE GROOM,

38:55.100 --> 38:56.833
WHICH SIDE DO YOU SIT ON?

38:56.867 --> 38:59.167
I JUST LOOK FOR
THE HOTTEST CHICK IN THE ROOM

38:59.200 --> 39:01.067
AND SIT NEXT TO HER.
STOP.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.833
WANNA DITCH THE RECEPTION,
GRAB A DRINK INSTEAD?

39:02.867 --> 39:05.667
STOP IT.
YOU DON'T WANT ME.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.367
MAYBE I DO.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.700
NO, YOU DON'T.

39:08.733 --> 39:11.367
YOU WANT AVA.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.067
SHE'S NOT AVA ANYMORE.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.300
SHE'S REBECCA NOW,
AND I BARELY KNOW HER.

39:15.333 --> 39:17.233
LOOK AT ME.

39:19.833 --> 39:21.600
YOU SUCK.

39:21.633 --> 39:22.800
TO ME, YOU SUCK.

39:22.833 --> 39:25.567
I KIND OF... HATE YOU.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.600
BUT, ALEX, WE DO NOT GET

39:28.633 --> 39:31.700
UNLIMITED CHANCES
TO HAVE THE THINGS WE WANT.

39:31.733 --> 39:34.300
AND THIS I KNOW...

39:34.333 --> 39:37.167
NOTHING IS WORSE THAN MISSING
AN OPPORTUNITY

39:37.200 --> 39:39.467
THAT COULD'VE
CHANGED YOUR LIFE.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.133
AND NO MATTER
WHAT HER NAME IS,

39:41.167 --> 39:43.733
SHE'LL ALWAYS BE AVA TO YOU.

39:43.767 --> 39:47.833
***

39:47.867 --> 39:50.567

39:50.600 --> 39:52.733
YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE WEDDING EITHER.

39:52.767 --> 39:54.467
NO.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.600
SO, UM...

40:05.633 --> 40:08.100
WHAT DO I DO NOW?
(chuckles)

40:08.133 --> 40:12.067
YOU FAIL YOUR INTERN TEST,
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.233
YOU CAN...

40:14.267 --> 40:17.700
WALK AWAY FROM BEING
A SURGICAL RESIDENT ALTOGETHER,

40:17.733 --> 40:21.500
OR YOU CAN START
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

40:21.533 --> 40:24.367
REPEAT MY INTERNSHIP?

40:26.133 --> 40:30.233
NO. I CAN'T.

40:30.267 --> 40:32.433
(chuckles)

40:32.467 --> 40:35.033
***

40:35.067 --> 40:36.800
I CAN'T.

***

40:47.733 --> 40:49.067
DID I...

40:49.100 --> 40:51.567
DID I FAIL YOU, GEORGE?

40:51.600 --> 40:52.800
NO.

40:52.833 --> 40:56.367
***

40:56.400 --> 40:58.367
NO.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.533
I FAILED YOU.

41:02.567 --> 41:05.300
(sighs)

41:05.333 --> 41:09.367

41:12.800 --> 41:14.700
OOH. IT LOOKS SO PRETTY
IN THERE.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.133
I SEE BURKE.
(wolf whistle sounds)

41:17.167 --> 41:18.633
YANG....

41:18.667 --> 41:21.267
THE TWINS LOOKS NICE
IN THAT DRESS.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.633
THANK YOU. SORT OF.
(church bells ringing)

41:23.667 --> 41:25.533
I GOTTA GO.
I GOTTA CHECK--
YOU'RE ON CALL?

41:25.567 --> 41:27.533
OH, WAIT, ALEX.
DID YOU SEE GEORGE IN THERE?

41:27.567 --> 41:29.300
I DON'T SEE HIM.

41:29.333 --> 41:31.267
HE'S, UH...
PROBABLY GONNA BE LATE.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.400
WE HAD KIND OF A BIG,
EMOTIONAL DAY.
OH, REALLY?

41:33.433 --> 41:36.100
YEAH.
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
BETWEEN YOU TWO? I MEAN--

41:36.133 --> 41:38.833
NO. IT'S JUST THAT I WAS
NAMED CHIEF RESIDENT.
OH.

41:38.867 --> 41:41.700
PLUS WE DECIDED
TO HAVE A BABY, SO...

41:41.733 --> 41:43.133
A BABY?

41:43.167 --> 41:45.333
YEAH, WE'RE TRYING.
WE TRIED TODAY, IN FACT.

41:45.367 --> 41:46.633
WOW.

41:46.667 --> 41:49.200
YEAH. BIG DAY. (chuckles)

41:52.400 --> 41:55.067
OKAY, THIS IS IT.

41:55.067 --> 41:56.233
OKAY?
YEAH.

41:56.267 --> 41:57.767
YOU HAVE THE BOUQUET.
YEAH.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.133
I HAVE THE RING.
YEAH.

41:59.167 --> 42:00.633
YOU REMEMBER YOUR VOWS?
YEAH.

42:00.667 --> 42:02.067
OKAY.
I WROTE THEM ON MY...

42:02.067 --> 42:05.067
OH, MY GOD.

42:05.067 --> 42:06.567
I SCRUBBED IN.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.467
I SCRUBBED IN,
AND THE VOWS WERE ON MY HAND.

42:09.500 --> 42:11.500
I SCRUBBED OFF MY VOWS.
OH, OKAY. UM--

42:11.533 --> 42:13.233
OKAY, HELLO?
I-I SCRUBBED OFF MY VOWS.

42:13.267 --> 42:15.400
I-I CAN'T--I CAN'T DO THIS.
I DON'T HAVE ANY--

42:15.433 --> 42:17.833
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
ON MY HAND!

42:17.867 --> 42:21.733
(music continues)

42:21.767 --> 42:24.800
I SHOULD GO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.167
WELL, CRISTINA WOULDN'T BE
CRISTINA

42:26.200 --> 42:28.333
IF SHE DIDN'T NEED
A LITTLE PUSH.

42:28.367 --> 42:31.067
(sighs)
THERE ARE NO WORDS
IN MY HEAD. OKAY?

42:31.067 --> 42:32.733
I HAVE NO VOWS.
NO VOWS.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.400
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

42:34.433 --> 42:36.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?
STOP SAYING THAT!

42:36.400 --> 42:39.333
WILL YOU SAY SOMETHING ELSE?
LIKE WHAT?

42:39.367 --> 42:42.333
SAY SOMETHING
THAT IS GONNA HELP ME.
OKAY, OKAY! I...

42:42.367 --> 42:44.267
MEREDITH, PLEASE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? SAY SOMETHING.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.833
SAY--YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.200
SAY--SAY--OKAY.

42:47.233 --> 42:49.133
SAY WHAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU
IF YOU WERE ME.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.667
OKAY.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.600

GOOD, GO.

42:52.633 --> 42:53.800
STOP WHINING.

42:53.833 --> 42:55.533
THIS IS YOUR WEDDING DAY.

42:55.567 --> 42:58.200
YOU WILL GO DOWN THAT AISLE
AND YOU WILL GET MARRIED.

42:58.233 --> 43:00.600
IF I HAVE TO KICK YOUR ASS
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY

43:00.633 --> 43:02.833
TO GET YOU THERE,
YOU WILL WALK DOWN THE AISLE.

43:02.867 --> 43:05.167
YOU WILL GET MARRIED.
DO YOU HEAR ME, CRISTINA?

43:05.200 --> 43:09.167
WE NEED THIS. WE NEED YOU
TO GET YOUR HAPPY ENDING.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.800
OKAY, I'M READY.

MEREDITH TALKED ME DOWN.

43:53.700 --> 43:56.767
REALLY, I'M FINE. GO, GO, GO.
I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.633
I'M SORRY.

43:58.667 --> 44:02.233
OH... I CAN DO THIS.

44:02.267 --> 44:05.133
YOU KNOW, I HAD A MOMENTARY
FREAK OUT, BUT NOW I'M FINE.

44:05.167 --> 44:06.500
I CAN DO THIS. GO.

44:06.533 --> 44:08.433
BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS.

44:08.467 --> 44:11.333
I'M UP THERE WAITING FOR YOU
TO COME DOWN THE AISLE,

44:11.367 --> 44:13.067
AND I KNEW
YOU DON'T WANT TO COME.

44:13.100 --> 44:14.333
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO COME

44:14.367 --> 44:18.100
BUT THAT YOU'LL COME ANYWAY
BECAUSE YOU LOVE ME.

44:18.133 --> 44:20.100
AND IF I LOVED YOU--

44:20.133 --> 44:22.767
IF I LOVED YOU,

44:22.800 --> 44:25.667
NOT THE WOMAN THAT I'M TRYING
TO MAKE YOU BE,

44:25.700 --> 44:27.633
NOT THE WOMAN THAT I HOPE
YOU'LL BECOME,

44:27.667 --> 44:30.600
BUT YOU--

44:30.633 --> 44:32.533
IF I DID...

44:32.567 --> 44:35.467
I WOULDN'T BE UP THERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

44:37.333 --> 44:39.267
I WOULD BE LETTING YOU GO.

44:43.067 --> 44:45.067
I AM WEARING THE DRESS.

44:45.067 --> 44:46.567
I'M READY.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.200
AND--AND MAYBE
I DIDN'T WANT TO BEFORE,

44:49.233 --> 44:50.600
BUT I WANT TO NOW.

44:50.633 --> 44:52.500
I REALLY THINK I WANT THIS.

44:52.533 --> 44:56.467
AND I REALLY WISH
THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK.

44:56.500 --> 44:59.333
I WISH THAT YOU KNEW.
