WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.700
It's a reasonable settlement offer

00:02.701 --> 00:05.101
1.5 million plus 500 hundred thousand severance

00:05.102 --> 00:07.302
Plus you sign a confidentiality agreement

00:07.303 --> 00:08.803
That might put a little crimp in my plant

00:08.804 --> 00:10.404
To pen a Tell-All-Book?

00:10.505 --> 00:14.505
With at least five chapters about how my Zire
Motors exposÃ© cost me  my anchor desk

00:16.306 --> 00:17.606
Well that's the thing

00:18.007 --> 00:19.807
My company didn't fire him

00:20.708 --> 00:23.108
I know because I have the email he wrote resigning

00:23.209 --> 00:26.209
He quit, so why don't I just offer him 2 million dollars?

00:26.210 --> 00:28.510
Because it's still less than what a trial wind up costing you

00:28.811 --> 00:29.911
Sam Russell won't settle

00:31.012 --> 00:31.912
Eli won't let him

00:31.913 --> 00:32.713
How do you know?

00:33.414 --> 00:34.514
I know Eli

00:34.515 --> 00:37.315
Personally, I think you should reject this offer and go to trial

00:37.716 --> 00:40.116
If for no other reason than I
don't want to take all this stuff down

00:40.817 --> 00:44.617
Hopefully among all that stuff there's a
way to get around that email I sent

00:44.618 --> 00:46.218
I'm not interested in getting around it

00:46.319 --> 00:50.419
You didn't resign Sam, you simply
formalized their defact of firing of you

00:50.420 --> 00:52.120
It's called constructive termination

00:52.121 --> 00:56.321
Basically they are arguing that demoting
Sam was tantamount to firing him

00:56.322 --> 00:57.722
Except I didn't demote him

00:57.723 --> 01:00.523
My news director moved him to another time slot

01:00.524 --> 01:02.624
Which is exactly what we need you to say on the sand

01:02.625 --> 01:04.625
I don't have time to take the stand, I have a company to run

01:04.626 --> 01:06.426
Find the time Mr. Buckley, look

01:06.927 --> 01:13.727
No jury will find Baywest Media sympathetic
if its own CEO can't be bothered to tell the story

01:13.728 --> 01:16.228
You have a compelling story.  You tried to tell the truth

01:16.229 --> 01:19.529
To corporate power and you ended
up getting exiled to 5 am

01:19.530 --> 01:24.430
Went from covering neoracist to reporting
about fender benders and the 101

01:24.431 --> 01:26.931
You're angry Sam and you have every reason to be

01:26.932 --> 01:28.532
But if the jury sees that anger

01:29.033 --> 01:29.833
We're dead

01:29.834 --> 01:31.934
Don't worry I won't come off angry

01:31.935 --> 01:34.035
Because I'm not, I'm concerned

01:34.036 --> 01:37.236
They banished me because of a story
they thought was critical to their advertisers

01:37.237 --> 01:39.237
You think I am the only anchor in
the country with that problem?

01:39.238 --> 01:40.738
I'm not doing this because I need the money

01:40.739 --> 01:44.539
I'm doing it because my entire career has
been about bringing the truth to light

01:45.340 --> 01:47.640
They want to take away my anchor, that's fine

01:48.441 --> 01:50.141
I'll do it from the witness box

01:50.742 --> 01:52.342
Alright, big day tomorrow

01:52.343 --> 01:53.943
Get a good night sleep

01:53.944 --> 01:55.244
Is that what you'll be doing?

01:55.245 --> 01:58.845
No I'll be writing Boudoir questions
and an opening statement

02:00.346 --> 02:03.046
And, drinking a lot of coffee

02:05.847 --> 02:06.247
Eli

02:06.548 --> 02:08.048
Will you excuse me for a moment?

02:08.048 --> 02:10.548
I think I'm about to cameo in my own shorts and sandals movie

02:11.749 --> 02:15.949
I heard you had your eccentricities but
this isn't exactly making me swell of confidence

02:15.950 --> 02:17.550
Don' worry. I won't bill you for the time

02:43.451 --> 02:47.751
That reputation you got for eccentricity
might be a little understated

02:50.352 --> 02:55.252
Don't tell me.  You want me to start looking
into circus related workman cups claims

02:55.553 --> 02:58.653
No!  Just find out what gladiators or ancient Rome or

02:58.654 --> 03:00.554
Latin maybe that have to do with the Russell case

03:00.555 --> 03:03.655
Oh!  Should that'll be cinch, a --- so you numb score

03:03.656 --> 03:05.456
Do you want me to call Dr. Chen for you?

03:05.457 --> 03:06.257
No

03:06.258 --> 03:07.058
Why not?

03:07.059 --> 03:09.159
You have the vision he inteprets it, isn't that how it works?

03:09.160 --> 03:10.860
When we're speaking to each other, which we're not

03:10.861 --> 03:12.261
Just tell me what this means to you?

03:12.262 --> 03:15.762
Ancient Rome, two gladiators and more
gore than in An Inconvenient Truth

03:15.763 --> 03:18.263
It is and inconvenient truth I don't do vision voodoo

03:18.264 --> 03:22.464
Chen is the one you take that stuff to, it's bad
enough you make me do all the paper work

03:22.465 --> 03:23.265
Fine

03:25.166 --> 03:27.966
Any luck getting those documents Maggie
hightailed out of Sonoma with?

03:27.967 --> 03:29.367
And a good morning to you too

03:29.368 --> 03:33.368
It would be a good morning if we had
Baywest internal memos about our client

03:33.369 --> 03:34.869
I mean it's not like we are going on trial today

03:34.870 --> 03:36.470
No, wait, we are

03:36.471 --> 03:39.371
I have a motion to compel locked and
loaded, it should be a slam duck

03:39.372 --> 03:41.072
Then why isn't Maggie playing by the rules?

03:41.073 --> 03:41.973
I have no idea

03:41.974 --> 03:43.574
Maggie is usually very big with the rules

03:43.575 --> 03:44.775
So you don't know what's gotten into her?

03:46.876 --> 03:51.376
Off the top of your head do you foresee
gladiators having any significance to our case?

03:51.477 --> 03:53.977
Don't you have an acupuncturist entertainer for this sort of thing?

03:53.978 --> 03:54.878
I'm not speaking to him

03:55.279 --> 03:56.279
What about your brother?

03:56.280 --> 03:56.980
Nate neither

03:56.981 --> 03:59.481
Well you should, if you don't want to talk to your acupuncturist fine

03:59.482 --> 04:00.582
But you should always talk to family

04:00.783 --> 04:02.783
Good morning Eli, Taylor

04:02.784 --> 04:03.884
Good morning

04:04.585 --> 04:08.085
I just uh... I just need a muffin

04:08.186 --> 04:10.086
Uh... there are no muffins

04:10.087 --> 04:11.287
Sir

04:10.988 --> 04:14.988
Oh, well then... I'll just, uh...

04:14.989 --> 04:16.488
It's fine, I was just leaving anyway

04:20.490 --> 04:21.390
Everything OK?

04:22.191 --> 04:23.691
Just a little family's fray, we'll be fine

04:23.992 --> 04:24.792
OK

04:24.793 --> 04:28.193
Well, I'm here should you feel a need to...

04:28.194 --> 04:31.294
Much as I appreciate  you offer to be my personal Dr. Feld, Eli

04:31.295 --> 04:33.895
By now what you should be worrying about is your case

04:35.396 --> 04:35.996
Yes of course

04:35.997 --> 04:37.597
What happened to you have to talk to family?

04:37.598 --> 04:39.198
I meant you and your family

04:39.199 --> 04:40.799
My circumstances are different

04:40.800 --> 04:42.100
Different how?

04:42.101 --> 04:44.001
Hey sweetie!  Ready for trial?

04:44.002 --> 04:44.802
Ready for documents

04:44.803 --> 04:46.603
Theft of evidence is a felony

04:46.604 --> 04:49.704
And refusal to produce it to opposing
counsel is an ethics violation

04:49.705 --> 04:51.905
Right, cause you really want to lecture me on ethics here

04:54.506 --> 04:56.306
What he's done to her to piss her off?

04:56.307 --> 04:58.807
I have no idea but she's the one who
offscounded with our documents

04:58.808 --> 05:00.008
Well, technically they're my documents

05:00.009 --> 05:02.809
Actually not even technically, they belong to my client

05:02.810 --> 05:05.110
Which your client is required to let me see

05:06.611 --> 05:09.011
Obviously it's no secret that you're
sleeping with the enemy, huh?

05:09.412 --> 05:11.112
No the secret is I made a baby with her

05:11.313 --> 05:12.413
Mmm, you think?

05:12.414 --> 05:14.214
Oh, right

05:14.215 --> 05:18.115
Which reminds me to remind you that we've
got a 3D ultrasound tomorrow, 2.30 sharp

05:18.116 --> 05:20.016
You know on 3D I'm gonna be able to tell the gender

05:20.017 --> 05:21.617
We agreed to wait!

05:21.618 --> 05:24.418
And besides, whatever it has it's
going to be about milimeter big

05:24.419 --> 05:26.719
Not if it takes after its daddy

05:28.520 --> 05:31.120
Leaving Sonoma without saying goodbye it was one thing

05:31.121 --> 05:32.921
Not returning my calls that's another

05:32.922 --> 05:34.022
And I get all that

05:34.023 --> 05:34.723
I'm so very glad

05:35.724 --> 05:38.524
Things are awkward between us,
it's uncomfortable because of...

05:39.425 --> 05:41.325
Is that american sign language for sleeping together?

05:41.326 --> 05:45.226
My point is, freezing me out that's one
thing but withholding evidence?

05:45.227 --> 05:46.627
That's totally something else

05:46.628 --> 05:48.128
There are other people involved here

05:48.129 --> 05:49.829
Right, my clients

05:49.830 --> 05:52.530
And they have an attorney willing
to fight to protect their interests

05:52.531 --> 05:57.131
Look, bottomline I'll show you those files over
my dead body or when a judge orders me too

05:57.132 --> 05:58.432
Whichever comes first

05:59.233 --> 06:02.133
Then let's go see the judge and we'll
table the dead thing for later

06:02.134 --> 06:02.834
Let's!

06:02.835 --> 06:05.835
This is ridiculous, the documents we've requested are totally relevant

06:05.836 --> 06:09.636
But Ms. Dekker has refused to comply with three 
document requests and a motion to compel

06:09.637 --> 06:10.837
That's true Your Honor

06:10.838 --> 06:13.638
Then why haven't you produced the
documents as requested, Ms. Dekker?

06:13.639 --> 06:17.339
Oh, I'm sorry,  I meant it's true I haven't
complied with Mr. Stone's discovery request

06:17.340 --> 06:21.440
But that's because there's nothing in them
that requires me to give him the documents

06:21.441 --> 06:24.141
Yes there is, it's called the rules of civil procedure

06:24.142 --> 06:27.242
If we actually had produced the documents you'd have seen that Jennifer Cantino

06:27.243 --> 06:30.243
West Media's inhouse counsel was copied on every single one of them

06:30.243 --> 06:35.043
Which means they're privileged, which means we have no
obligation to let Mr. Stone or anyone else see them

06:35.044 --> 06:38.744
You can't retroactively make something
privilege by CCing counsel after the fact

06:38.745 --> 06:40.445
There's nothing retroactive about it

06:40.446 --> 06:43.646
All the documents were dated before
Sam Russell got moved to 5 AM

06:43.647 --> 06:47.347
Which is the event Mr. Stone claims
was tantamount to firing Mr. Russell

06:47.348 --> 06:47.848
Your Honor

06:47.849 --> 06:48.749
She's got you Mr. Stone

06:48.750 --> 06:49.750
She doesn't have me

06:49.751 --> 06:50.351
No kidding

06:50.352 --> 06:52.252
And that the attorney client privilege is not a...

06:52.253 --> 06:57.653
Mr. Stone, unless you can prove Ms. Cantino is
not an attorney, not West Media's attorney

06:57.654 --> 07:01.854
Or that the memos were written to
her after Russell got fired or quit

07:01.855 --> 07:02.655
She's got you

07:04.056 --> 07:06.256
So, any other pre-trial motions?

07:06.257 --> 07:07.157
I have one Your Honor

07:07.758 --> 07:09.658
I move to disqualify Mr. Stone

07:09.659 --> 07:10.659
You what?

07:10.660 --> 07:11.960
On what grounds?

07:11.961 --> 07:13.161
He thinks he's a prophet

07:23.662 --> 07:28.062
Several months ago, Mr. Stone stood in your courtroom
and told you he received messages from the Almighty

07:28.063 --> 07:31.663
I believe my exact words were
Higher Power, perhaps Divine

07:31.664 --> 07:35.264
And last year he predicted the Silver
Terrace earthquake to some public notoriety

07:35.265 --> 07:39.765
Which actually supports the idea that
I could be, you know, special

07:39.766 --> 07:42.266
Which is an unfair advantage in a jury trial

07:42.267 --> 07:46.567
What juror wouldn't be swayed by the fact that
the plaintiff's counsel has God as one of his clients

07:46.568 --> 07:47.668
She's right

07:48.269 --> 07:49.269
She is?

07:49.270 --> 07:54.170
In so far as the personal details of the trial
attorneys, may prejudice the jury

07:54.171 --> 07:54.471
Your Honor

07:54.472 --> 07:58.272
So we should make sure that they don't find out that
Ms. Dekker and I slept together last week

07:58.273 --> 07:59.473
That is totally inapropriate

07:59.474 --> 08:01.074
You dog!  I knew it was just a matter of time

08:01.075 --> 08:03.375
So if you think of it she's also
sleeping with opposing counsel

08:03.376 --> 08:04.076
That's irrelevant!

08:04.077 --> 08:05.477
And now she's carrying his unborn child

08:05.478 --> 08:07.678
And did I mentioned that Mrs. Wethersby and I used to be engaged?

08:07.679 --> 08:13.179
So basically what you're saying is I'm the only person
in this room who's not having sex with one of you?

08:14.780 --> 08:18.680
And that Ms. Dekker's motion might be motivated
more by personal issues than legal ones

08:18.681 --> 08:19.481
You wish

08:19.482 --> 08:22.482
Enough!  Save it for your inevitable reality show

08:22.483 --> 08:28.283
If Mr. Stone does work for God, I'm not gonna
chance damnation by disqualifying him

08:28.284 --> 08:36.583
But if I hear any of you utter one more word about prophets,
prophecies or specially who's sleeping with whom

08:36.585 --> 08:40.684
I will hold you in contempt,
I swear... to Mr. Stone's boss

08:44.486 --> 08:50.186
I've worked at KNIB for twelve years.  Until recently we
have a number one news show in San Francisco

08:50.187 --> 08:51.487
We did about an 18 share

08:51.488 --> 08:54.388
What about around the time you offered
Mr. Russell the morning show

08:54.389 --> 08:55.889
We were down to an 11.3

08:55.890 --> 08:59.390
We were hemorraging viewers and
rank third among the affiliates

08:59.391 --> 09:00.291
So you fired him

09:00.292 --> 09:02.792
No... I offered him the morning news

09:02.793 --> 09:05.293
It's a less competitive time slot

09:05.294 --> 09:07.094
Frankly, I thought Sam would be grateful

09:08.395 --> 09:09.395
Thank you

09:13.096 --> 09:16.996
You uh... offered Sam the morning news

09:16.997 --> 09:19.097
The day after you killed one of his stories

09:19.098 --> 09:23.298
An expose on unsafe working
conditions at a local Zire Motors plant

09:23.299 --> 09:24.299
I didn't kill anything

09:24.300 --> 09:25.100
We'll get to that

09:25.101 --> 09:29.001
What relationship, if any, does KNIB have with Zire Motors?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.602
Zire's one of our advertisers

09:30.603 --> 09:33.303
Nearly every major auto manufacturer is

09:33.304 --> 09:36.504
But Zire is your station's third largest advertiser

09:36.505 --> 09:41.205
How upset would you say Zire was
with Mr. Russell's expose, scale it 1 to 10

09:41.206 --> 09:41.906
I wouldn't know

09:41.907 --> 09:43.507
But you pulled the piece anyway just in case

09:43.508 --> 09:46.908
I didn't pull it.  It got bumped by stories I deemed more important

09:46.909 --> 09:48.609
What was the more important piece you had that night?

09:49.810 --> 09:50.710
I don't recall

09:50.711 --> 09:52.211
I had a feeling you wouldn't so I looked it up

09:54.812 --> 09:58.912
Uh, you replaced the Zire Motors report with a public safety story

09:59.513 --> 10:02.213
Bilingual bandit strikes the bay area

10:03.514 --> 10:05.714
We felt it was the more compelling story

10:05.715 --> 10:08.615
I've never been held up in two languages
so I'll take your word for it

10:08.616 --> 10:11.516
Why didn't you air the Zire Motors' report the next night?

10:11.517 --> 10:13.617
Did the bilingual bandit strike again?

10:13.618 --> 10:18.418
No, but news cycles are getting shorter and shorter
We can't stay competitive with cable and internet

10:18.419 --> 10:20.219
By airing yesterday's news

10:20.220 --> 10:23.420
Oh I forgot, hazardous working conditions are so last year

10:26.221 --> 10:31.421
Alright for Russell I think we should send in the 
Magster after what she did to Stone yesterday

10:31.522 --> 10:33.622
I can't afford not to use a little pitbull

10:33.623 --> 10:35.923
Plus the jury eats her innocent act right up

10:35.924 --> 10:37.924
You know I'm sitting right here, don't you?

10:39.625 --> 10:40.925
Sorry, I should take this

10:40.926 --> 10:42.126
Hi sweetie

10:42.127 --> 10:45.427
Yeah take all the time you want, it's
not like we're in trial here or anything

10:45.428 --> 10:47.928
Look, I can't find my keys, I'm gonna be late, alright?

10:47.929 --> 10:50.329
Uh, and tell the nurse when you get there if she can sign us in

10:50.330 --> 10:53.130
Listen, we uh... have a strategy meeting

10:53.131 --> 10:53.931
Well so do I!

10:53.932 --> 10:57.332
But I'm not going!  I mean we only get to see our fetus in 3D once!

10:57.333 --> 10:59.033
I thought you were excited about this!

10:59.034 --> 11:02.134
I am, it's just a bad time, I don't think I should leave

11:02.135 --> 11:05.435
Listen, I am really, really sorry

11:05.436 --> 11:06.836
I just can't make it today

11:06.837 --> 11:09.137
I'm one of two lawyers on our side

11:09.138 --> 11:13.838
You've enough to feel the baseball team but somehow
I can make it, you know, because it's important to me

11:14.038 --> 11:20.738
It's important to me too.  I have to triage, I can't move
this meeting but you can get the nurse to burn me a DVD

11:20.739 --> 11:23.739
Right, I forgot how babies can me time-shifted

11:24.340 --> 11:28.140
The media has changed.  The news
division used to be a public service

11:28.141 --> 11:31.041
Something to broadcast your deed in
exchange for using the public airwaves

11:31.042 --> 11:33.042
Now it's just another way to make a buck

11:33.043 --> 11:33.943
Objection!

11:33.944 --> 11:37.244
She's about to point out how that doesn't
seem related to you leaving the station

11:37.745 --> 11:38.945
It's related

11:38.946 --> 11:41.646
Because news has become a profit center

11:41.647 --> 11:43.247
And I threatened the station's profits

11:43.248 --> 11:44.648
With the Zire Motors' piece?

11:44.649 --> 11:48.549
I was demoted to 5 AM drive time time
one day after they killed that story, so...

11:48.550 --> 11:49.750
You tell me Mr. Stone

11:54.151 --> 11:55.951
What's a cue score?

11:55.952 --> 11:59.852
It's a way of measuring an on-air
personality's familiarity and appeal

11:59.853 --> 12:02.953
But it surprised you to learn that your cue score
has been in decline for the past two years?

12:02.954 --> 12:07.454
I'm assuming since you're probably not less familiar
to people it was because you became less appealing

12:07.455 --> 12:08.255
Objection!

12:08.256 --> 12:09.756
Woah, I'll... I'll put it another way

12:09.757 --> 12:10.957
What's more likely?

12:10.958 --> 12:13.358
A conspiracy to keep Sam Russell away from an anchor desk...

12:13.359 --> 12:17.559
Or a desire to replace him with someone
who can pull in a larger audience?

12:17.559 --> 12:19.259
You made my point for me, Ms. Dekker

12:19.260 --> 12:21.260
In the days of Cronkite and Muro

12:21.261 --> 12:25.261
Decisions were not made based on cue scores and sharepoints

12:25.262 --> 12:29.862
You're right, Muro's show was cancelled because it lost its sponsor

12:33.663 --> 12:35.963
It's like she went back to law school when I wasn't paying attention

12:35.964 --> 12:38.964
Don't underestimate the ambition of a woman scorned

12:38.965 --> 12:39.865
What does that mean?

12:39.966 --> 12:40.866
Are you kidding?

12:40.867 --> 12:43.267
Oh, you think she's out to get me because I...

12:43.268 --> 12:47.768
Got her!  Yeah you motivated her to beat you in ways
that go way beyond the normal courtroom asswipping

12:47.769 --> 12:52.969
So all last year, I was trying to figure out how to make her a
better lawyer and the whole time I should've just slept with her

12:53.170 --> 12:55.070
My loyal fit soldiers

12:55.871 --> 12:56.471
How did it go today?

12:56.472 --> 12:57.472
Just great - Not great

12:57.473 --> 13:00.673
She's right, somewhere between great and not so much

13:00.674 --> 13:03.974
Sam's testimony wasn't exactly the grand slam we were counting on

13:04.875 --> 13:06.875
That's uh... unfortunate

13:08.176 --> 13:10.676
You make unfortunate sound so much worse than unfortunate

13:11.277 --> 13:13.877
It's nothing, something we can discuss after the trial

13:13.878 --> 13:17.878
Sir, we're partners. I'm not sure keeping secrets
is gonna do either one of us any good

13:19.479 --> 13:20.979
I didn't want to say anything to either of you

13:20.980 --> 13:23.680
We're already... operating under enough pressure

13:23.681 --> 13:24.381
What's wrong?

13:24.382 --> 13:26.482
I just got off the phone with our accountants

13:26.483 --> 13:31.183
We were treading water before the financial
crisis made getting a line of credit difficult

13:31.184 --> 13:31.984
What are you saying?

13:32.785 --> 13:36.485
That if we don't win the Russell case, and win big

13:36.486 --> 13:39.586
We'll be joining Mr. Russell on the unemployment line

13:49.887 --> 13:51.087
Matt!

13:51.088 --> 13:52.088
Hi!

13:52.989 --> 13:55.689
I might still be sleeping but I'm pretty sure
you didn't stay here last night

13:55.690 --> 13:59.190
I let my self in.  Hope you don't mind, I wanted to surprise you

13:59.191 --> 14:00.991
With bluberry pancakes?

14:00.992 --> 14:01.592
Yeah

14:02.593 --> 14:05.693
It's an incredibly good smelling apology

14:05.694 --> 14:06.994
Tastes even better

14:09.695 --> 14:10.595
I am sorry

14:10.596 --> 14:15.596
I wanted to be there, I should've been there, I just
felt weird bailing out of my team, you know?

14:15.597 --> 14:17.597
In the middle of the world series I get it

14:17.798 --> 14:20.798
They're the Yankees and I'm playing for the Red Sox

14:20.799 --> 14:26.099
Well, not exactly because the Yankees and the Red Sox
had never played each other in the World Series, but...

14:26.100 --> 14:27.700
Anyway, it's just a trial

14:27.701 --> 14:28.501
Yeah

14:29.502 --> 14:32.302
You do know your client is not facing the death penalty here, right?

14:32.303 --> 14:34.403
Not my client, my firm

14:36.404 --> 14:38.104
You can't use this, OK?

14:38.105 --> 14:41.105
This is boyfriend-girlfriend confidence, OK?

14:41.106 --> 14:43.206
Two-people-who-made-a-baby-together privilege

14:43.207 --> 14:44.507
I must have missed that class in lawschool

14:44.508 --> 14:46.208
What's going on?

14:46.709 --> 14:48.109
The new firm is sinking

14:48.110 --> 14:51.010
We are in massive debt... we can't get credit

14:51.011 --> 14:55.411
We need an infusion of cash and the only way we
can do that is a huge win in the Russell case

14:55.412 --> 14:57.612
AKA a miracle

14:57.613 --> 14:59.313
Jeez!

14:59.314 --> 15:00.214
Are you OK?

15:00.215 --> 15:02.615
You mean aside from being pregnant and about to being unemployed?

15:02.616 --> 15:03.816
Yeah

15:03.817 --> 15:05.217
I'm so sorry

15:05.218 --> 15:09.018
Look, I wasn't gonna mention this but since
you're kind of opening the door here

15:09.019 --> 15:11.319
P and K has an opening for family lawyer

15:11.820 --> 15:14.120
When Wethersby Stone goes down

15:14.121 --> 15:16.721
If it goes down

15:16.722 --> 15:20.022
There are about a hundred other firms I could work at that

15:20.023 --> 15:22.023
Don't employ the father of my baby

15:22.024 --> 15:23.924
But they probably won't hire you in your current condition

15:23.925 --> 15:27.125
Which would be sexist and detestable

15:27.126 --> 15:29.226
Posner and Klein is just detestable

15:29.227 --> 15:31.527
No, I'd rather be stay-at-home mom

15:31.528 --> 15:33.428
Hey, I work for that detestable firm, remember?

15:33.429 --> 15:35.429
Yeah, I know. I spend most days trying to forget that

15:38.130 --> 15:39.730
It's an impossible situation

15:39.731 --> 15:42.531
When the internet and 24/7 cable news started

15:42.532 --> 15:46.232
The recession and credits anomies threatening to finish

15:46.333 --> 15:50.433
Hard choices have to be made if evening
news of any strive is gonna survive

15:50.434 --> 15:52.434
Including pandering to advertisers?

15:52.435 --> 15:55.835
Neither Baywest nor its affiliates have ever pandered to anyone

15:55.836 --> 15:57.536
Including Zire Motors

15:57.537 --> 16:01.137
Which paid Baywest Media 3 million dollars last year alone

16:01.138 --> 16:02.238
In ad revenue

16:02.239 --> 16:04.739
Which buys the right to advertise not editorialize

16:04.740 --> 16:10.240
So Sam Russell's contemption that the evening
news is driven by corporate interest

16:10.241 --> 16:11.441
Is offensive

16:11.442 --> 16:13.342
And completely unfounded

16:13.343 --> 16:15.743
What about moving him to the 5 AM traffic and weather slot?

16:15.744 --> 16:17.644
One of the hard choices I letted to earlier

16:17.645 --> 16:21.845
But evening news ratings have gone up
5 points since, so it's not one I regret

16:27.346 --> 16:30.446
It must have been difficult for you to find a worthy replacement

16:30.447 --> 16:34.747
For three-time Dupont, two-time Peabody 
award winning journalist Sam Russell?

16:34.847 --> 16:38.647
It's been a challenge but we have a great
deal of confidence in Kimberly Chaves

16:38.648 --> 16:40.648
I've seen a few of her segments, I can see why

16:42.649 --> 16:48.949
Cardiff fainted from toxic chemicals during a sunless spray tan
session because the spray guns tubes weren't properly cleaned

16:48.950 --> 16:53.550
But Ashley didn't let that stop her from attending
her son's and daughter's foundation benefit

16:53.551 --> 16:54.951
At the San Francisco Zoo

16:56.552 --> 16:59.652
Well, I know I'm gonna cancel my spray tan appointment this afternoon

16:59.653 --> 17:04.153
All local affiliates fill their lineup with some
fluff pieces.  It's not that hard to find them

17:04.354 --> 17:08.854
No, but what is becoming increasingly hard to
find at your news station is any real news

17:08.855 --> 17:10.755
What's considered real news is a matter of opinion

17:10.756 --> 17:12.656
You're right.  Let's use a clear standard

17:12.656 --> 17:17.457
How many investigated reports has Kimberly Chaves done on
your corporate sponsors since replacing Sam Russell?

17:17.458 --> 17:20.657
Off the top of my head I... I don't remember

17:20.659 --> 17:23.959
That's surprising since zero is a pretty easy number to remember

17:23.960 --> 17:27.060
You also probably don't remember what 
the top story was on your competitors'

17:27.060 --> 17:30.861
Programs the night Kimberly aired her hard-hitting spraytan expose

17:31.961 --> 17:35.261
It was a story about how your parent
company CEO was indicted for stock fraude

17:36.762 --> 17:37.862
You were brilliant!

17:37.863 --> 17:39.263
Thank you!

17:39.264 --> 17:44.664
You totally supported the emerging theory that if I sleep with
someone it endows them their superior courtroom skills

17:44.665 --> 17:46.965
I think I'm beginning to understand the problem you have with women

17:54.966 --> 17:56.366
Ciao, Bella!

17:59.767 --> 18:01.067
Excuse me!

18:01.068 --> 18:04.668
Is this uh... Am I in Rome?

18:04.669 --> 18:06.669
Che si, Roma, Roma!

18:06.670 --> 18:09.270
- Italian -

18:11.771 --> 18:13.471
Maggie... hey!

18:17.572 --> 18:18.572
Eli

18:18.573 --> 18:20.073
What are you...?

18:22.074 --> 18:23.574
So what was that about?

18:23.575 --> 18:24.675
Another vision?

18:24.676 --> 18:30.376
Rome again.  Modern day this time... and Maggie
was there and I couldn't get to her

18:30.377 --> 18:32.477
Maybe because you already did back in Sonoma

18:32.478 --> 18:41.178
Hmm... OK... Shouldn't have slept with her but , there was wine
and I've been dealing with some stuff

18:41.179 --> 18:42.579
And you love her

18:42.580 --> 18:45.880
OK, maybe it's not love yet but it's something

18:45.881 --> 18:47.881
Yeah, it's called platonic affection

18:49.782 --> 18:50.182
What?

18:50.183 --> 18:54.783
Eli, why are you the only person who doesn't seem to
be aware that you feel something for Maggie?

18:54.784 --> 18:59.784
OK, maybe it's not love but it's definitely not platonic affection

18:59.785 --> 19:01.585
You two belong together

19:01.586 --> 19:04.386
It's obvious to everybody else except you

19:05.887 --> 19:12.287
OK... maybe... what if Maggie was just available

19:12.288 --> 19:15.188
I've been feeling very alone lately

19:15.189 --> 19:16.689
You know?

19:16.690 --> 19:20.190
Like there's, there's no one for the guy with the divine calling

19:20.191 --> 19:24.491
I think there is, Eli.  I think she's been right in front
of you the entire time, you just haven't seen it

19:24.492 --> 19:27.592
It's like the aneurism woke up every part of you

19:27.593 --> 19:28.893
Except your heart

19:32.794 --> 19:33.794
So what do I do?

19:34.795 --> 19:35.995
Talk to her

19:40.896 --> 19:41.596
Can we talk?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.097
All rise!

19:43.098 --> 19:44.098
Apparently not!

19:48.399 --> 19:49.399
Be seated

19:49.900 --> 19:50.700
Alright

19:51.301 --> 19:52.601
Next witness

19:53.702 --> 19:55.502
The defense calls Jesse Bates

19:55.503 --> 19:59.303
Uh, Your Honor, Jesse Bates is not on their witness list

19:59.304 --> 20:02.904
I listed three former KNIB employees as John Doe witnesses

20:02.905 --> 20:05.605
Ms. Bates was a producer at NIB for thirteen years

20:05.606 --> 20:06.206
Your Honor

20:06.207 --> 20:07.407
Overruled counsel

20:07.408 --> 20:09.908
I'll give you more time to prepare if you want

20:14.909 --> 20:16.909
You're here under supina, aren't you Ms. Bates?

20:16.910 --> 20:21.210
Yes, I enjoyed the Sheriff's visit to my home very much, thank you

20:21.211 --> 20:22.811
Seek to treat as hostile

20:22.812 --> 20:23.812
Granted

20:23.813 --> 20:26.613
Did you produce Sam Russell's piece on Zire Motors?

20:26.614 --> 20:28.214
Yes

20:28.215 --> 20:30.815
So you would be in a position to know 
whether that piece had any relationship 

20:30.816 --> 20:33.516
To the decision to move Mr. Russell to the morning show

20:34.316 --> 20:35.316
I really don't know

20:35.317 --> 20:36.417
Let's guess then

20:37.618 --> 20:40.618
The news director Mr. Church moved Sam the next day

20:40.619 --> 20:45.319
But didn't Mr. Church proposed to Sam a move to
the morning show a full six months earlier?

20:46.220 --> 20:48.320
Before the Zire piece was even investigated?

20:49.721 --> 20:51.021
Is there a point here?

20:51.022 --> 20:56.622
Well only that if Sam Russell really believed that being
moved to 5 AM was the same as getting fired...

20:56.623 --> 20:59.523
He would've stopped showing up for work six months earlier

21:00.323 --> 21:02.223
But he didn't, did he?

21:08.624 --> 21:11.724
You're not an attorney, so you probably don't
know why this would be important

21:11.725 --> 21:13.425
But you know what would've been helpful?

21:13.426 --> 21:16.226
Knowing that the thing that we rested your entire case on

21:16.227 --> 21:19.327
The idea that moving you to 5 AM was as good as firing you

21:19.328 --> 21:22.428
Was discussed the good six months before you quit!!

21:22.429 --> 21:24.529
Being discussed is a little different than being done

21:24.530 --> 21:25.330
Semantics!

21:25.331 --> 21:29.031
Lawyers and judges and apparently news anchors care about them

21:29.032 --> 21:30.032
But you jurists don't

21:30.033 --> 21:32.133
To them it looks like you quit!

21:32.134 --> 21:35.734
Which is a little detrimental to our client that you got fired

21:35.735 --> 21:42.135
Right, I forgot.  A jury is just 12 people too stupid to get
out of jury duty, incapable of parsing distinctions

21:42.136 --> 21:45.036
Incapable of thinking for themselves.
You know what you sound like Eli?

21:45.037 --> 21:46.537
A trial attorney trying to win

21:46.538 --> 21:50.838
Baywest Media: sorry Sam that story is just
gonna go right over the public's head

21:50.839 --> 21:56.139
Sorry Sam, but they're just not going to understand that,
sorry Sam it's just too darn confusing Sam

21:57.240 --> 22:00.040
I have a theory... you could say I'd bet my whole career on it

22:00.041 --> 22:02.841
I think people are only as dumb as we treat them

22:02.842 --> 22:05.942
I think people only act like morons if they're treated like morons

22:05.943 --> 22:07.343
What do you think?

22:09.644 --> 22:12.444
I think Taylor and I have a long night ahead of us

22:16.645 --> 22:17.845
I'll let you get to it then

22:23.346 --> 22:25.446
They could hear you on the first floor

22:25.447 --> 22:30.647
I would tell you that berating clients is bad for
business but that would imply we have any business

22:30.648 --> 22:31.848
Sorry, we had a set back

22:31.849 --> 22:35.749
Oh... maybe I can help brainstorm a solution

22:35.750 --> 22:38.050
Perhaps, bring in a fresh perspective

22:38.051 --> 22:39.251
We're fine - we're great

22:42.352 --> 22:43.052
Right

22:43.653 --> 22:44.753
Of course

22:44.754 --> 22:48.054
Don't worry, we'll find a rabbit to pull here

22:57.055 --> 23:01.355
Mmhh... a little more of that artic wind and the
polar bears might have a home again

23:01.356 --> 23:02.856
I don't want to talk about it, OK?

23:02.857 --> 23:06.857
What could be so bad for you to treat him like that
when his firm is about three inches from belly up?

23:06.858 --> 23:09.758
How about chasing my mother out of town and
lying to me about it for 20 years?

23:09.859 --> 23:11.259
OK, that's bad enough

23:12.660 --> 23:14.060
I'm so sorry, are you OK?

23:14.061 --> 23:17.361
I fluctuate.  Luckily I've got Matt to take it out on

23:18.662 --> 23:20.262
I guess you're right to be angry

23:23.563 --> 23:26.563
I recently found out that someone was responsible for my dad's death

23:27.464 --> 23:29.264
It's been little hard to get over

23:29.265 --> 23:31.365
Why do I sense a but coming on?

23:31.866 --> 23:36.266
But, more than anyone I know, Jordan's
been trying to change who he was

23:36.267 --> 23:38.267
I'm afraid it's too little too late comes to mind

23:38.268 --> 23:41.368
You know, if he'd just had told me all this years ago

23:41.369 --> 23:45.969
When I still needed a mother, I would've been furious but at
least there would've been time to fix things, you know?

23:45.970 --> 23:47.370
And now...

23:47.371 --> 23:49.671
My mother... lives a thousand miles away

23:50.572 --> 23:55.272
It's been decades... I think the window of oportunity has closed

23:58.073 --> 23:59.673
The window of oportunity

24:02.674 --> 24:04.174
Care to run that by me again?

24:04.175 --> 24:08.975
Happily Your Honor, the other day you ruled that we couldn't
review the Baywest documents that we requested because

24:08.976 --> 24:10.776
They were protected by attorney-client privilege

24:10.777 --> 24:11.677
Because they are

24:11.678 --> 24:16.178
Because you said that all the documents were
dated before Sam Russell was moved to 5 AM

24:16.179 --> 24:18.679
But yesterday Ms. Bates altered that timeline

24:18.680 --> 24:22.280
Now it's obvious that the documents were
written after the 5 AM move was proposed

24:22.281 --> 24:24.081
We really should be thanking you actually

24:24.082 --> 24:26.582
The documents were still copied to in-house counsel

24:26.583 --> 24:28.883
After apparently the wheels were put in motion

24:28.884 --> 24:33.284
Ms. Wethersby was right when she said you can't
retroactively make something privilege

24:33.285 --> 24:38.585
Make sure those documents are delivered to Wethersby
Stone and Associates by end of business today

24:38.586 --> 24:39.886
Now get out of here

24:42.087 --> 24:43.287
This is huge!

24:43.288 --> 24:46.288
Easy Taylor, we don't know if there's
anything in there that's going to help us

24:46.289 --> 24:49.889
If there wasn't Maggie would've just produced them if for
no other reason than to waste our time reviewing them

24:49.890 --> 24:52.190
Posner and Klein just delivered your documents

24:52.191 --> 24:52.991
That was fast

24:52.992 --> 24:56.292
I know... I thought it would take them
forever just to unload the truck

24:56.293 --> 24:57.293
Unload the truck?

24:57.294 --> 24:59.294
How many documents could there be?

25:01.595 --> 25:03.295
What was that you said about wasting our time?

25:03.296 --> 25:04.696
I can't believe you would do this!

25:04.697 --> 25:06.897
Let me guess! You got the boxes

25:06.898 --> 25:08.798
The judge ordered you to produce those documents

25:08.799 --> 25:09.899
Which we did

25:09.900 --> 25:11.600
No, you hid them in a ton of crap!

25:11.601 --> 25:13.101
Well that's one interpretation

25:13.102 --> 25:14.602
And that's just more crap, you know?

25:14.603 --> 25:18.103
Is this how your new firm does business Matt?
Is this how you do business?

25:18.104 --> 25:20.204
We're in trial Taylor, it's just tactics

25:20.205 --> 25:24.505
Circumventing a court order to hide
evidence isn't a tactic, it's illegal

25:24.506 --> 25:28.206
And as morally ambiguous as you pretend to be
there was a time you knew the difference

25:28.207 --> 25:30.007
OK, that's fair.  I'll own that

25:30.008 --> 25:31.308
But?

25:31.309 --> 25:35.009
But, and I wouldn't be floating this if I
weren't safely eight cityblocks away,

25:35.010 --> 25:37.410
This anger's a bit of an overreaction

25:37.411 --> 25:39.911
Is it possible some of it's debt related?

25:39.912 --> 25:44.012
Yes, it is debt related you know what?  It's 
related to the kind of dad you're going to be 

25:44.013 --> 25:46.113
Which is related to the kind of person you are

25:46.113 --> 25:47.613
That's not fair

25:47.614 --> 25:50.714
I don't think you've got much credibility
right now when it comes to fairness, Matt

25:54.315 --> 25:56.315
What are we even looking for, Eli?

25:56.316 --> 26:00.316
The box that says seek which smoking gun document in here?

26:00.317 --> 26:01.917
It'd be nice if they were that obvious about it

26:01.918 --> 26:05.618
We need some kind of system and some more
manpower, perhaps hire some temps

26:06.719 --> 26:09.119
I don't think that's gonna be necessary

26:12.220 --> 26:13.420
This is the one

26:14.821 --> 26:17.521
Do you recall writing an email to Ryan Church?

26:17.522 --> 26:21.522
He's the news director of one of my affiliates.
I recall writing hundreds of emails to him

26:21.523 --> 26:22.723
How about this one?

26:24.524 --> 26:26.924
If you could... read it aloud, please

26:26.925 --> 26:31.925
Church, heard about Russell's autoplant story,
needless to say Zire is not throwing him a parade

26:34.526 --> 26:36.226
Take care of the problem, DB

26:36.227 --> 26:40.527
I guess since Zire motors only purchased
the right to advertise not editorialize

26:40.628 --> 26:42.628
You just threw in the problem solving for free

26:45.529 --> 26:51.029
Mr. Buckley, can you read the portion of this email where
you specifically asked Mr. Church to fire Mr. Russell?

26:51.030 --> 26:53.330
No, because I never did

26:54.831 --> 26:58.331
So what was the problem with Zire
Motors that you wanted Mr. Church to fix?

26:58.332 --> 27:01.632
If it would help I could have the judge remind
you what the penalties are for perjury

27:07.733 --> 27:08.833
The problem was Sam

27:08.834 --> 27:10.434
What about him?  Specifically

27:12.935 --> 27:16.935
Zire wanted assurance Sam wouldn't keep pushing his story

27:17.636 --> 27:20.936
I guess Sam wouldn't have much of a
reason to for the 5 AM traffic report, huh?

27:25.337 --> 27:26.937
Eli, don't let your window close

27:27.338 --> 27:28.238
What?

27:29.439 --> 27:31.039
Do you think it's open now?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.740
She can't be too happy with me after what I did back in there

27:33.741 --> 27:37.241
Which is why you need to do this now before she's
gotten too much scar tissue over her wounds

27:37.242 --> 27:40.342
You know I slept with her, right?
I didn't hit her with a baseball bat

27:41.343 --> 27:42.043
Go!

27:48.644 --> 27:49.344
Come on!

27:49.345 --> 27:49.845
Hey!

27:49.846 --> 27:50.446
Come here

27:53.347 --> 27:55.747
Aooh!  My wrist is fine thanks!

27:55.748 --> 27:57.748
Sorry but... we have to talk

27:57.749 --> 27:59.849
No, you want to talk, a slight distinction

27:59.850 --> 28:00.750
Yeah, right!  I want to talk

28:00.751 --> 28:02.451
So, all you got to do is listen

28:03.552 --> 28:04.452
OK?

28:05.453 --> 28:11.753
Firstly, I'm... Look I'm sorry about Sonoma... I just...

28:13.054 --> 28:17.654
What we did... it was... it was wonderful.  It was great

28:19.355 --> 28:20.255
And I'm glad we did it

28:21.456 --> 28:25.456
On the next morning I just... I had to think about my feelings

28:26.557 --> 28:33.257
Specially in light of your feelings which you told me... are substantial

28:33.158 --> 28:35.758
Were... substantial

28:35.760 --> 28:36.360
What?

28:36.361 --> 28:40.261
I tried... every conceivable way to get over you

28:40.262 --> 28:43.362
I got engaged... I left the firm

28:43.363 --> 28:49.363
Never in a million years would I think that sleeping
together would actually... help me get over you

28:52.364 --> 28:53.464
So thank you

28:54.965 --> 28:56.365
You gave me closure

29:06.666 --> 29:14.266
So why have you been so um... why things
have been so personal... with the case

29:14.267 --> 29:16.367
No, it's not personal! I'm trying to win Eli

29:16.368 --> 29:21.468
I can't beat you and be friends with you at the same time.
I can't multitask like that

29:23.069 --> 29:25.969
But after I beat you we can go for coffee

29:25.970 --> 29:26.970
Catch up

29:29.071 --> 29:31.471
Yeah... best friends

29:31.472 --> 29:35.172
Yeah... exactly

30:04.473 --> 30:12.773
In a minute, Baywest's lawyer is gonna stand here and
she's going to remind you how Sam Russell quit his job

30:12.774 --> 30:16.974
But the reality is you cannot quit a job
that's already been taken away from you

30:18.175 --> 30:23.675
Sam Russell was removed from his job
anchoring the Bay area evening news

30:23.676 --> 30:25.676
That's indisputable

30:25.677 --> 30:27.077
It's uncontested

30:27.678 --> 30:32.178
But the fact is that Sam lost his job much earlier than that

30:33.879 --> 30:37.079
He's been loosing it bit by little bit for years

30:37.080 --> 30:42.380
When the news division at Baywest Media
became part of the entertainment division

30:42.381 --> 30:47.481
When the wall between the boardroom and the
newsroom grew so thin as to become nonexistent

30:47.482 --> 30:54.582
And when television journalism became just
something else to fill time between commercials

30:54.583 --> 31:01.383
And yes, when his corporate bosses decided that if they
couldn't shut him up then they would force him out

31:03.484 --> 31:04.284
And they did

31:05.485 --> 31:08.385
Sam Russell has been silenced

31:09.686 --> 31:18.286
And now the only one who can tell Baywest Media that the
media needs to start living up to its responsibilities is you

31:37.887 --> 31:40.987
You know? He's absolutely right

31:40.988 --> 31:43.888
The news media has lost its moral center

31:43.889 --> 31:47.089
It's become dominated by corporate interest

31:47.090 --> 31:54.090
Kitty Kirk went on record saying that she felt corporate
pressure to cast the Iraq war in a positive light

31:54.091 --> 32:01.091
Even President Bush's fore press secretary ironically
refers to the liberal media because it's become so focused

32:01.092 --> 32:04.992
On advancing Republican policies which benefit, guess who?

32:04.993 --> 32:06.393
Corporations

32:07.094 --> 32:15.194
The journalistic spirit that Andy McCarthyism at exposed
Watergate has been co-opted into making the case for WMD's in Iraq

32:15.195 --> 32:17.495
And ignoring calamity in New Orleans

32:17.496 --> 32:21.096
And that's when he's not peoccupied by Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears

32:22.397 --> 32:26.997
And when you consider how critical a
free press is in a democracy like ours

32:26.998 --> 32:29.498
It's particularly loadsome

32:29.499 --> 32:31.699
But you want to know what's really loadsome?

32:32.900 --> 32:38.200
Trying to convert your justifiable outrage
into a personal financial windfall

32:38.901 --> 32:43.801
If Sam Russell were really that concerned about
the state of the media he wouldn't have quit

32:43.802 --> 32:48.602
He would've stayed on and worked to
change the system from the inside

32:49.503 --> 32:52.603
Rather than running to you for a handout

32:57.804 --> 32:58.904
It could go either way

32:59.605 --> 33:01.905
Then it won't inconvenience them to go our way

33:01.906 --> 33:07.606
Even if they rule for us, for Sam, there's little guarantee of the
money judgement sufficient to keep our lights on

33:07.607 --> 33:09.007
Thank you Mr. Optimist!

33:09.008 --> 33:14.808
I'm just being truthful.  Let alone those lines,
you two made me very proud

33:14.809 --> 33:17.809
I couldn't fathom two attorneys I'd rather practice with

33:18.610 --> 33:20.210
So you'll be retiring then?

33:26.111 --> 33:31.311
Hello?  You want me to... why?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.012
OK

33:37.013 --> 33:39.313
Um... I'll be back in a moment

33:49.314 --> 33:51.814
OK, I'm not gonna bother telling you how weird this is

33:51.815 --> 33:53.115
I have a settlement offer

33:53.116 --> 33:54.816
Which you felt the need to make in a closet?

33:54.817 --> 33:58.617
Does the offer involves us making out
cause, no ofense, but I just...

33:58.618 --> 34:01.718
It's quite possible the rest of my team doesn't
know about this offer, but my client does

34:01.719 --> 34:04.519
And he's willing to pay Sam 5 million dollars

34:06.020 --> 34:07.420
Does Sam have to make out with you?

34:07.421 --> 34:08.621
This is serious

34:08.621 --> 34:11.422
It's a public perception thing.  Sam still got a few fans

34:11.422 --> 34:15.623
5 million dollars buys an end to this settlement
and a public statement saying he resigned

34:16.422 --> 34:18.223
Sam's gonna have a problem with that

34:18.224 --> 34:19.424
Not as big a problem as you've got

34:19.425 --> 34:23.824
One third contingency on 5 million
dollars is Wethersby Stone's life route

34:23.826 --> 34:27.826
Ok?  Don't go and tell like a minute after I'm out the door

34:27.827 --> 34:28.527
Of course

34:31.828 --> 34:33.228
Should I even consider this?

34:33.228 --> 34:34.129
It's a lot of money

34:34.130 --> 34:35.830
Enough to start over

34:35.831 --> 34:37.031
Put all this behind you

34:37.032 --> 34:40.532
But I want them to admit that what they did was
wrong, not just wrong but disrespectful

34:40.533 --> 34:42.233
Mercenary terpretude

34:42.234 --> 34:48.234
Sorry Sam but... that kind of admission
just doesn't happen in the real world

34:48.235 --> 34:50.335
Certainly not in the world of corporate America

34:50.335 --> 34:54.136
Yes, they might take a hit from the jury but they also might not

34:54.137 --> 34:56.437
At least this way you're guarantedd something

34:56.438 --> 34:58.738
And after they pay you 5 million dollars

34:58.739 --> 35:02.439
Baywest is gonna think twice about
trying to silence another reporter

35:02.439 --> 35:03.439
I see your point

35:03.440 --> 35:05.040
So you'll take it?

35:06.341 --> 35:07.941
Do I have a choice?

35:07.942 --> 35:09.042
Of course you have a choice

35:10.743 --> 35:15.843
Sam, you were wronged. The station forced you out, we
all know that and by allowing them to get away with it

35:15.844 --> 35:19.844
We are allowing corporate greed to roll over journalistic ethics

35:19.845 --> 35:23.745
To --- the first amendment, you need to stand up for what is right

35:23.746 --> 35:26.446
But there is a cost to that

35:26.447 --> 35:28.047
Yes, to your conscience

35:29.148 --> 35:32.748
Sleepless nights and anxious mornings
when the reality of your mistakes

35:32.749 --> 35:37.049
Plague you the most when you realize
that you've compromised your principles

35:37.049 --> 35:38.549
That you've done the wrong thing

35:39.250 --> 35:44.450
Believe me when I tell you living with regret
is much harder than living with defeat

35:45.851 --> 35:51.451
You've come this far, if you settle now I'm afraid
you'll lose something far worse than a trial

35:55.352 --> 35:56.552
He's right

35:57.553 --> 35:59.153
I know it

36:01.154 --> 36:02.254
No deal

36:06.155 --> 36:07.455
I'll go tell Matt

36:22.456 --> 36:23.556
Maggie!

36:24.557 --> 36:26.157
Ciao mia bella ragazza

36:26.158 --> 36:27.558
Ciao

36:39.059 --> 36:43.559
We the jury in the matter of Samuel
Russell vs. Baywest Media Incorporated

36:43.560 --> 36:45.060
Find in favor of

36:47.261 --> 36:48.361
The defendant

37:03.262 --> 37:09.862
Congratulations!  Not only is there a nice paycheck in it
for us but we got to nail Wethersby Stone and Associates

37:09.863 --> 37:12.663
Where really hurts: their wallets

37:15.664 --> 37:18.664
And I would specially like to thank Maggie Dekker

37:22.265 --> 37:27.365
For her sweet voice and placid demeanor bely her inner animal

37:27.366 --> 37:29.366
She was a panther out there people

37:32.967 --> 37:36.767
Alright, unless you can figure out a client to bill
for eating cupcakes get back to work

37:38.768 --> 37:40.768
Dowd... a word

37:42.069 --> 37:44.569
Actually its uh, two words

37:44.570 --> 37:46.370
Never again

37:46.871 --> 37:48.171
You know what I'm referring to?

37:49.372 --> 37:50.772
I'm pretty sure I've got an idea

37:50.773 --> 37:52.173
You're lucky they turned down that offer

37:52.174 --> 37:54.474
And you're lucky our client won

37:54.475 --> 37:57.375
Now I don't see you getting lucky three times in a row

37:58.476 --> 37:59.376
Do you?

38:01.777 --> 38:03.777
You were bit over your word limit there

38:06.678 --> 38:07.878
What are we gonna do?

38:07.879 --> 38:11.179
Well, there's still some paintings I can sell

38:11.180 --> 38:14.080
Some bills we can defer payment on

38:14.881 --> 38:17.881
They would buy us six months... maybe a little less

38:18.882 --> 38:20.182
You're not alone in this dad

38:22.283 --> 38:23.483
Why are you smiling?

38:23.984 --> 38:25.684
Just nice to hear you call me dad

38:26.885 --> 38:27.785
Hey!

38:27.786 --> 38:29.086
Matt

38:29.087 --> 38:30.687
What are you doing here?

38:30.788 --> 38:33.588
I heard Keith's got my old office

38:33.589 --> 38:36.189
That's just an unacceptable situation

38:37.890 --> 38:39.290
And so is Posner and Klein

38:39.291 --> 38:41.791
At least that's what it's turned out to be

38:42.992 --> 38:44.992
So you're...

38:44.993 --> 38:51.493
Well you're always going on about how your dad says
this place is about uh... making up for past mistakes

38:53.094 --> 38:54.394
I though I'd give that a try

38:58.095 --> 39:02.695
Not to rain on your parade but...
has anyone actually offered you a job here?

39:02.696 --> 39:04.596
How would you like to have a job here?

39:04.597 --> 39:09.397
Not to sound ungrateful but we can't
even afford to pay you minimum wage

39:09.398 --> 39:13.198
Oh no, take Stone's name off the door and we'll call it even

39:13.199 --> 39:14.999
Nice try

39:17.500 --> 39:24.100
Um... you were right... I wanna show the little Dowd or...

39:24.701 --> 39:29.201
Dowdette, what means to stand up for the things she care about

39:31.901 --> 39:34.201
She's gonna be very lucky to have you as a dad

39:36.202 --> 39:37.602
She?

39:38.103 --> 39:40.203
I couldn't help it when I went to the doctor the other day

39:40.204 --> 39:41.804
I just... I had to know

39:42.805 --> 39:43.805
I hope you're not mad

39:43.806 --> 39:45.406
No... I'm not mad!

39:45.407 --> 39:47.607
I'm having a girl, are you kidding me?

39:55.408 --> 39:58.108
Uh, yeah... if you just call up to her office, she'll let me in.

39:58.109 --> 40:01.209
It's Maggie Dekker. Two k's

40:01.210 --> 40:01.810
You're looking for Maggie?

40:01.811 --> 40:03.511
You just missed her, she's probably outside

40:05.112 --> 40:05.712
Thank you!

40:09.113 --> 40:11.313
Maggie!  Mag...

40:28.914 --> 40:34.314
Here... I think um... I think my window closed
