00:01.300 --> 00:03.490
Divorce lawyers like to say...

00:03.510 --> 00:08.039
that "love" is the ultimate
unenforceable contract.

00:08.470 --> 00:11.920
It is always being
re-negotiated by time.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.960
Whether it's the love of
a husband for his wife...

00:17.310 --> 00:20.290
or a parent for a child...

00:20.650 --> 00:23.520
or even a lover for their sweetheart...

00:23.550 --> 00:26.300
the day invariably
arises when the contract,

00:26.330 --> 00:31.300
the agreements and understanding
that define a relationship, change.

00:33.140 --> 00:37.830
The function of time, familiarity
or sometimes just Mother Nature.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.690
Well,well,if it isn't our own
Deputy Doll. Back for another test?

00:43.910 --> 00:45.370
I think the last one was defective.

00:45.410 --> 00:49.510
The plus sign looks more like a
division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.

00:54.070 --> 00:55.890
Third test today, Mama Bear.

00:55.910 --> 00:58.550
Your Eggo is preggo; no doubt about it.

00:58.570 --> 01:00.890
Silencio,old man.

01:00.910 --> 01:02.750
You pay for that pee
stick when you're done.

01:02.780 --> 01:06.070
Don't think it's yours just 'cause
you marked it with your urine.

01:11.610 --> 01:50.410
<i><b>Medium
Season 05 - Episode 05
** A Taste of Her Own Medicine **</b></i>

01:58.500 --> 01:59.330
But I don't get it.

01:59.360 --> 02:03.140
Why do I have to go to the doctor's
office when I don't feel sick?

02:03.180 --> 02:06.070
Well,'cause Mommy's working
again and Daddy's working again,

02:06.100 --> 02:08.490
which means we have our insurance back.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.699
So?

02:09.740 --> 02:13.690
So,that means that we can go to the
doctor, and somebody else will pay for it.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.030
Well,tell them to save their
money. We're not interested.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.670
We're all going to do it.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.950
Mommy's going to go see her doctor.

02:20.990 --> 02:24.170
Daddy's going to see
his doctor this morning.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.470
Everybody's going to get a checkup.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.610
Uh-oh,this isn't good.

02:28.650 --> 02:32.310
When they say "checkup,"
they mean shots.

02:32.330 --> 02:36.090
I don't want no, no shot.

02:36.110 --> 02:40.660
Hey now,just 'cause you're going to the doctor for
a checkup doesn't mean you're going to get shots.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.360
Right. And fish can't swim.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.290
I don't want a shot!

02:44.340 --> 02:47.600
Look at your sister,honey.
You're getting her all upset.

02:47.610 --> 02:49.320
Hey,I got an idea.

02:49.350 --> 02:54.220
What if,um,we go to the
doctor's office, and,well...

02:54.240 --> 02:59.710
we get the shots, and
then,afterwards, we go to the toy store

02:59.740 --> 03:03.140
and you guys let us pick
out whatever we want?

03:03.620 --> 03:04.640
What?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.510
Wait a second,where did you get that?

03:06.550 --> 03:08.850
They do it on television.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.570
Actually,I've seen it a lot.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.250
Well,I'm not interested in
talking about television,honey.

03:15.410 --> 03:18.130
I got to go to my doctor's appointment.

03:18.140 --> 03:21.190
Us,too. Us,too.

03:24.420 --> 03:27.140
Got a minute for a friend?

03:27.240 --> 03:28.230
Councilman Leaming...

03:28.280 --> 03:30.850
Don't fire anyone. I told
them not to announce me.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.680
I'm here on unofficial business.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.410
Well,then let me give
you one of these...

03:34.440 --> 03:37.850
unofficially,of course.
Save me a postage stamp.

03:37.860 --> 03:39.350
What the hell's this,Manuel?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.550
A party. It's Lily's idea,actually.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.440
A way to sort of thank everybody
who works here for hanging in there,

03:44.450 --> 03:45.980
keeping the faith while I was gone.

03:46.010 --> 03:48.180
But don't worry,we're
paying for everything.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.700
Not a dime of taxpayers' money.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.870
What's going on,Jimmy?

03:53.910 --> 03:58.040
You know my daughter Meredith-- finally
got married a little more than a year ago.

03:58.050 --> 04:01.650
Nice fella. He has a little
girl with heart trouble.

04:01.660 --> 04:03.320
Actually,that's how they met.

04:03.370 --> 04:06.180
Meredith was the little girl's nurse.

04:06.220 --> 04:11.090
Two days ago she sent my
wife and me this e-mail.

04:11.100 --> 04:14.670
"Dear Mom and Dad,I'm
embarrassed to tell you this,

04:14.680 --> 04:16.610
"but I think,for the
first time in my life,

04:16.649 --> 04:20.149
"I understand what it
means to hit rock bottom.

04:20.180 --> 04:22.870
"I think the only cure
is time and distance.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.500
"I need to get away.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.320
s his isn't forever, it's just for now.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.720
I promise to get in
touch soon. Meredith."

04:33.530 --> 04:35.140
I'm so sorry,Jim.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.190
She sent one to her husband,too.

04:38.230 --> 04:41.230
What can I do? How... can I help you?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.770
Sh She's been gone four days.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.480
My wife,my
son-in-law...

04:46.530 --> 04:50.100
they're convinced that
she's going to come back.

04:50.140 --> 04:54.820
But this is a girl who's never gone more
than 48 hours without calling me or her mother

04:54.830 --> 04:56.790
about some crisis or other.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.520
Did you go to the police?
File a missing persons report?

05:01.170 --> 05:04.690
I don't want to do
that. I'm a councilman.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.940
Her husband's a big shot
over at Phoenix West Bank.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.630
They're going to want to question him.

05:09.660 --> 05:12.400
And then the papers will
get ahold of it... no.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.010
You know,I have a couple of people who work
for me, pretty good at this kind of thing.

05:16.050 --> 05:19.550
And I know I can trust them
to keep it to themselves.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.520
Why don't you let me see what I can do.

05:21.530 --> 05:26.900
Joe. Joe! Joe.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.530
I need you to wake up.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.560
Oh,hey,Doc.

05:32.590 --> 05:35.250
Oh,sorry, must have dozed off.

05:35.280 --> 05:38.770
Yeah,the nurse said she's been
trying to wake you for ten minutes.

05:42.780 --> 05:45.030
Devalos said you wanted to see me.

05:45.070 --> 05:49.330
Yeah,I do indeed. I do indeed.
What's with the funny look?

05:49.340 --> 05:52.960
Nothing. You've just been on
my mind lately. You and Lynn.

05:53.650 --> 05:54.530
Well,how you guys doing?

05:54.570 --> 05:57.530
We're doing... I mean,you
know,to the extent we can.

05:57.540 --> 06:00.220
Haven't you got better
things to think about?

06:00.740 --> 06:03.490
Maybe. Maybe not.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.380
So what's all this?

06:05.430 --> 06:08.100
One of Manny's city
council buddies dropped by.

06:08.110 --> 06:10.620
Daughter ran out on her
husband couple days ago.

06:10.650 --> 06:13.160
Papa's stressing 'cause he
doesn't know where she is.

06:14.550 --> 06:16.830
- Pretty.
- Smart. Went to school.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.280
Started premed,dropped out.

06:19.540 --> 06:23.650
Became a private nurse,
which is when she met hubby.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.530
- Was he sick?
- His little girl. Born with a bad heart.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.480
Waiting for a transplant.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.610
First wife couldn't take
the pressure-- took off.

06:32.930 --> 06:36.570
He finally got divorced
in absentia and,uh...

06:36.580 --> 06:39.980
nursie here,Meredith, took her place.

06:40.010 --> 06:43.300
Anyway,I'm going to do the credit
card,cell phone monitoring thing.

06:43.330 --> 06:47.750
See what she might have spent, where she
might have spent it, who she might have called.

06:48.210 --> 06:51.070
Devalos asked me to put this little
care package together for you in hopes

06:51.100 --> 06:53.170
that you might do that voodoo you do,

06:53.210 --> 06:58.010
but I have a hunch our little wifey just
parked herself in a four-star hotel somewhere.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.710
Nice car.

06:59.740 --> 07:02.870
Daddy's little girl
has to have a nice car.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.860
So Marie,little Marie,
when he gave her her shot,

07:06.870 --> 07:11.400
she smiled,Joe. And Bridgette,whoo.

07:12.270 --> 07:17.500
You would have thought that he was performing
open-heart surgery without anesthesia.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.950
So afterward, I took
them to the toy store.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.090
I'm proud of you.

07:24.120 --> 07:29.170
Not letting your previously held convictions
get in the way of making our children happy.

07:31.290 --> 07:35.490
Now,listen,I got to talk to you about
something that happened at the doctor's office.

07:35.530 --> 07:37.670
What are you talking about?
You told me everything was fine.

07:37.680 --> 07:41.200
Yeah,it is. Well,sort of.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.610
He seemed to think that I have some kind
of a sleep deprivation thing going on.

07:46.650 --> 07:50.940
Doesn't everybody over the age of 12 have
a little sleep deprivation thing going on?

07:50.970 --> 07:54.960
I don't know, he seemed to think that
it was something to be taken seriously.

07:54.970 --> 07:58.410
All right,well,what
would make him think that?

07:58.440 --> 08:02.430
I think he got his first inkling when I
fell asleep in his waiting room this morning.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.210
Oh,my.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.870
The truth is,I am
exhausted all the time.

08:09.310 --> 08:15.810
At first,he wanted to check me into the hospital
one night next week and do a sleep study.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.910
That's where they hook you
up to a computer and they...

08:19.950 --> 08:22.580
they try to figure out
what the problem is.

08:22.630 --> 08:25.240
Then after we... you know,we...

08:25.610 --> 08:29.230
we talked for a little
while, we both realized...

08:33.789 --> 08:36.580
What,you both think this is my fault?

08:36.610 --> 08:40.900
Fault? Nobody mentioned fault.
I didn't use the word "fault."

08:40.909 --> 08:42.679
Okay,what word would you use?

08:42.720 --> 08:44.030
I don't want to use any word.

08:44.070 --> 08:46.840
I think the doctor's just trying
to figure out cause and effect.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.110
I don't think that
fault factors into it.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.420
And I'm the cause.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.830
Okay,look, I wouldn't use
the word "cause" either.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.270
But,Allison,you've got to be realistic.

08:54.340 --> 08:57.770
I mean,you're up once or twice a night,
which means that I'm up once or twice a night.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.310
The problem is,that after you tell me
about your dream I can't get back to sleep.

09:01.370 --> 09:06.610
I sit here and I stare and I wait for the sun
to come up or for you to have another dream.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.960
Okay,so what does he want us to do?

09:11.990 --> 09:14.620
What are we talking
here? Ear plugs,or...

09:14.630 --> 09:16.220
How do we handle this?

09:16.250 --> 09:19.060
I don't want you to be exhausted.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.970
Initially,he wants us
to try sleeping apart.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.260
That's his plan?

09:24.320 --> 09:25.620
Just for a week.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.870
I mean,I think it's more
diagnostic than anything else.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.760
You know,if after a week
I'm feeling better,then...

09:29.770 --> 09:30.910
What?

09:30.950 --> 09:35.070
If after a week you're feeling better--
what? That we'd sleep apart forever?

09:35.080 --> 09:36.870
Doesn't sound like much of a plan.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.030
Well,that's not his
plan, that's your plan.

09:39.060 --> 09:42.840
I mean,I'm sure he's got some kind of
a protocol in mind if this,you know,

09:42.870 --> 09:45.820
in fact,turns out to be the problem.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.900
3:20 in the morning.

11:07.460 --> 11:10.230
You poor thing.

11:12.910 --> 11:15.160
Allison Dubois asked for you today.

11:15.450 --> 11:17.860
Oh,yeah? Did you say hi for me?

11:17.870 --> 11:20.190
Yeah; course I did.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.290
You look at the mail in the living room?

11:22.330 --> 11:24.210
Devalos is having a party.

11:24.250 --> 11:28.590
He's sweet. He sent one invitation to you
here and one invitation to me at my place.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.170
So should I just RSVP for the two of us?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.100
I don't know. I can't even
think about that right now.

11:35.110 --> 11:38.060
Be careful in there. Might
still be a little toxic.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.130
Really? Rough night?

11:41.060 --> 11:44.620
Morning sickness. Talk
about false advertising.

11:44.630 --> 11:49.600
Of course,I guess if they called it all day, all
night sickness, nobody would ever want to get pregnant.

11:54.950 --> 11:57.920
Daddy? Daddy?

11:58.380 --> 12:01.750
Daddy? Daddy...

12:01.990 --> 12:07.050
Daddy! Are you and
Mommy having a divorce?

12:08.750 --> 12:11.310
Well,are you?

12:11.340 --> 12:17.380
No,of course not.
Nobody's getting a divorce.

12:17.810 --> 12:21.160
Why would you even think
something like that?

12:21.200 --> 12:22.730
- Bridgette!
- What?

12:22.740 --> 12:27.450
All I said was that, right after Celeste
McEvoy's dad started sleeping on the couch,

12:27.480 --> 12:30.170
they got a divorce.And they did.

12:30.210 --> 12:33.660
And then you told Marie that her dad then
took her to Universal in Florida for a week.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.960
Now she thinks we're going to Florida.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.570
Are we going to Florida?

12:38.610 --> 12:41.600
Oh,don't be ridiculous.
Nobody's getting divorced.

12:41.610 --> 12:44.410
Mom and Dad aren't getting
divorced. Come here!

12:44.420 --> 12:49.290
Daddy just needed a good night's sleep,you
know, 'cause sometimes your mom is,you know...

12:49.320 --> 12:51.320
I can hear that.

12:51.350 --> 12:55.040
Hey,why isn't everybody eating? Everybody
should be eating. It's getting late.

12:55.050 --> 12:58.880
Oh,hey, did you see the mail?
Devalos is having a party.

12:59.230 --> 13:02.750
Daddy's taking me to Florida.

13:05.530 --> 13:09.690
They started dredging the lake around
7:00 this morning. By 8:30,they found her.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.340
Oh,my God!

13:15.350 --> 13:17.530
I don't understand. This
can't be Meredith Burnes.

13:17.540 --> 13:18.780
She's only been missing three days.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.520
This woman looks like she's
been in the lake for years.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.940
Good guess. We're thinking two,actually.

13:23.950 --> 13:26.850
She was wearing this. It's
an engraved wedding band.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.860
"From Don to Clare. Always."

13:28.870 --> 13:30.620
Clare? Who's Clare?

13:30.630 --> 13:33.550
That would be Meredith's
husband's first wife.

13:33.570 --> 13:34.700
And this is her?

13:34.750 --> 13:38.390
In the flesh... or the
bones... or whatever.

13:39.900 --> 13:44.350
So Don's first wife wasn't just missing.
She didn't just run away. She was murdered.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.940
Well,yeah,obviously, she was murdered, but
that doesn't mean she didn't run away first.

13:47.970 --> 13:49.870
A stranger could have done this.

13:49.890 --> 13:52.330
Now hissecondwife is missing?

13:52.360 --> 13:55.850
It certainly seems like being married to this
Don fellow is a dangerous way to live your life.

13:55.890 --> 13:59.780
I was so sure that I was seeing
Meredith's murder. I even saw her car.

13:59.790 --> 14:02.090
Maybe her car was part of
it.Maybe Don borrowed her car,

14:02.100 --> 14:05.840
used it to transport the body so
there wouldn't be any DNA left in his.

14:05.850 --> 14:10.420
You want to ask him?

14:11.010 --> 14:12.160
Can I help you?

14:12.190 --> 14:14.970
I'm Detective Scanlon.
This is Allison Dubois.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.410
We're hoping to speak with Don Burnes.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.290
I really can't see that. I'll
have to take your word for it.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.060
I lost my glasses a few
days ago. Please come in.

14:29.100 --> 14:33.780
I'm Louise Leaming. Meredith's
mother. Councilman Leaming's wife.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.470
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Leaming.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.410
This must be a terrible time for you.

14:37.450 --> 14:41.120
Not really. No. I... I... I told James
not to bother you people with this.

14:41.130 --> 14:45.790
Meredith's fine.
She's... She will turn up.

14:46.460 --> 14:50.270
She'll come home. She's just Meredith.

14:51.040 --> 14:56.330
Honey,tell your father that some people from the
district attorney's office are here,all right?

14:58.020 --> 15:00.640
Did either of you ever meet Meredith?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.530
No.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.790
Well,she's mine, and I love her,

15:04.820 --> 15:11.010
but she thrives on attention the
way the rest of us depend on oxygen.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.630
This is her idea of bliss.

15:14.640 --> 15:19.250
Everybody is worried about her,
thinking about her, talking about her.

15:23.550 --> 15:25.430
I shouldn't be negative.

15:25.450 --> 15:29.780
She is an extraordinary
caregiver; a wonderful nurse.

15:29.820 --> 15:33.970
She has brought me the
most marvelous grandchild.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.670
She looks terrific, by
the way. Phoebe,I mean.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.850
Heard about her heart condition.
That she's waiting for a donor.

15:39.860 --> 15:41.100
You would never know.

15:41.160 --> 15:45.660
Oh,thank you. Yes. She's...
She's at a good period right now.

15:45.670 --> 15:50.630
Last week,I... I was afraid
we were going to lose her.

15:51.070 --> 15:55.530
She still misses Meredith. That's
why I'm here. To keep her mind off it.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.920
Louise?

16:02.790 --> 16:05.340
I'm Don Burnes.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.740
I'll keep Phoebe occupied
while you three talk.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.270
Sit down,hm?

16:19.210 --> 16:20.350
Any news?

16:20.400 --> 16:24.590
Well,there is, but it doesn't
have anything to do with Meredith.

16:24.600 --> 16:29.090
We've found your first
wife's remains, Mr. Burnes.

16:29.140 --> 16:32.630
She was beaten and then drowned.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.440
When? And by who?

16:40.450 --> 16:44.090
We don't know that yet but, obviously,
this changes the way we look at things

16:44.100 --> 16:47.140
with regard to the second Mrs. Burnes.

16:48.010 --> 16:50.600
I see. So this is a dual purpose visit.

16:50.610 --> 16:56.170
Well,you're not being accused of anything at the
moment, Mr. Burnes, but you're a person of interest.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.050
We're in the process of obtaining
a warrant to search your house.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.790
You don't need a warrant.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.200
You have my permission
to look wherever you want.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.710
Phoebe and I can go and stay with
Meredith's folks for a few days,

17:07.740 --> 17:10.180
so there won't be
anyone here in your way.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.530
I appreciate you making
this easy,Mr. Burnes.

17:12.579 --> 17:15.290
I'll be sure and mention
it to the district attorney.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.940
You do that.

17:18.410 --> 17:23.970
Also tell him that these
women were taken fromme,

17:23.980 --> 17:26.530
notbyme.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.410
Give him that message.

17:32.450 --> 17:35.180
You got your cell phone in here?

17:35.190 --> 17:38.510
No,it's in the kitchen, where I want it.

17:38.830 --> 17:41.150
I'msleeping out on the couch.

17:41.350 --> 17:43.270
- What?
- You heard me.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.790
If we're going to do this,
we're going to take turns.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.350
It's my turn to sleep
on the couch tonight.

17:47.390 --> 17:51.520
So I've unplugged the phone for you...

17:51.530 --> 17:53.750
given you clean sheets.

17:53.780 --> 17:59.900
I want you to get eight hours of
beautiful, uninterrupted sleep.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.360
Meredith-- right
on time as always.

18:06.370 --> 18:07.800
Mrs. Burnes.

18:07.850 --> 18:09.660
This stuff is a drug,you know.

18:09.690 --> 18:12.360
It's okay. It's legal. I'm a nurse.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.780
So how's my girl doing today?

18:14.810 --> 18:17.390
Ah,Phoebe? Not so well.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.580
She,uh... had a rough night.

18:19.590 --> 18:21.760
Weallhad a rough night.

18:21.770 --> 18:24.700
I'm guessing she'll be
sleeping for a while.

18:24.730 --> 18:27.170
You sit here. I just
need to finish this.

18:27.180 --> 18:29.530
You relax.

18:29.560 --> 18:33.030
You're the missus, I'm the
help. Drink your poison.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.060
I don't know about you, Meredith.

18:37.090 --> 18:39.060
You're some kind of saint.

18:39.090 --> 18:42.600
I keep saying to Don, "That
woman,she is too good to be true.

18:42.630 --> 18:45.580
She's got to be going home
at night and kicking her cat."

18:45.640 --> 18:48.780
Never with my shoes
on; only with my socks.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.250
You all right, Mrs. Burnes?

19:10.770 --> 19:14.270
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.530
Good morning,Chef Boyardee.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.340
I was trying to be
quiet. Did I wake you?

19:52.350 --> 19:55.430
No. Not you. Just the
smell of all that good food.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.070
You got a good night's sleep,didn't you?

19:58.100 --> 20:00.120
I cannot tell a lie.

20:00.150 --> 20:03.250
Look at you. You're
beaming. I hate that.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.210
How wasyournight, my dear?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.890
Not for the faint of heart.

20:10.900 --> 20:14.690
Turns out that woman that we've been looking
for-- Councilman Leaming's daughter...

20:14.700 --> 20:16.560
Yeah?

20:16.600 --> 20:19.520
She murdered her husband's first wife.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.820
Now,what would posses somebody
to do something like that?

20:23.870 --> 20:26.170
I don't know.

20:26.210 --> 20:30.280
Maybe Don loved her.
Maybe she loved Don.

20:30.290 --> 20:32.730
Maybe... maybe Don wasn't in on it.

20:32.740 --> 20:38.720
Maybe Don found out about it, and killed
her to avenge his first wife's death.

20:40.100 --> 20:45.060
Do you see all the good stuff that
you miss when you don't sleep with me?

20:45.830 --> 20:48.710
We're almost ready. You
want to go wake the kids?

20:49.950 --> 20:52.730
Oh,that's right. We have kids.

20:52.740 --> 20:55.840
Oh,gosh! I just rembered.
Today is Dentist Day.

20:55.850 --> 20:58.190
- Dentist Day?
- Yeah. After school.

20:58.510 --> 21:00.970
Oh,boy. More toys.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.610
What time is it?

21:18.650 --> 21:21.110
It's 10:40 in the morning.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.070
Well,what are you doing here? I
thought you were Miss Early Bird.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.830
I like to be. But I need to
talk to you about something.

21:28.470 --> 21:32.440
And,lately,it seems like you only come
home when you think I might be asleep,

21:32.480 --> 21:35.320
and you only wake up when
you think I might be gone.

21:35.910 --> 21:38.290
What is it,Lynn? What do
you want to talk about?

21:38.300 --> 21:41.130
I need to RSVP to that party.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.980
Okay.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.490
Well,you know what?
Don't worry about it.

21:48.500 --> 21:53.470
You take care of your RSVP,
and I'll take care of mine.

21:53.970 --> 21:57.070
So we're not going together?

21:57.080 --> 21:59.850
I don't know; I have no idea.

21:59.880 --> 22:04.450
I mean,to be perfectly honest with you,
I've given this absolutely no thought.

22:04.460 --> 22:07.790
Frankly, I'm kind of amazed you have.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.770
Yeah,well... maybe it's the hormones.

22:11.780 --> 22:17.080
I don't know; I mean,I know there are a
lot more important conversations to be had.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.610
A lot more important
conversations being avoided.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.070
You know why I leave here so early?

22:28.090 --> 22:33.110
I want to get behind my desk before anyone else
gets in so I don't have to answer any questions.

22:33.120 --> 22:37.480
'Cause,Lee, I don't
know how to answer them.

22:39.980 --> 22:43.250
It's our baby,Lee. And
I know we didn't plan it.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.150
I know you didn't bargain for it.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.380
I don't expect you to marry me.

22:47.410 --> 22:51.770
I'm not asking you to
do anything, except...

22:52.680 --> 22:57.890
please don't ask me to go into
that party looking like this...

22:57.900 --> 23:00.840
by myself.

23:04.030 --> 23:07.540
Anyway,you think about it.

23:15.770 --> 23:18.540
See? This whole side of
my mouth is,like,dead.

23:18.550 --> 23:20.480
Still can't feel a thing.

23:20.510 --> 23:23.790
I think the dentist might have
drilled into your brain by accident.

23:23.820 --> 23:28.040
All right,Bridge, Marie,come
on-- it's almost bedtime.

23:29.490 --> 23:31.700
Marie,what's the matter?

23:31.710 --> 23:33.120
Knock,knock.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.690
Go away. I'm not home.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.470
What an inscrutable expression.

23:43.510 --> 23:45.610
What has gone through
that brain of yours?

23:45.650 --> 23:47.110
I'm frustrated.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.300
Well,I could maybe help you with that.

23:49.310 --> 23:51.830
Not that kindof frustrated.

23:51.870 --> 23:54.110
I want to know where Meredith Burnes is.

23:54.150 --> 23:56.700
You know,this Meredith woman,
you know,she'll show up.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.410
Trust me. She's not Jimmy Hoffa.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.570
Eventually,they'll find
her, they'll find the car.

24:00.610 --> 24:02.940
There'll be some DNA or
something in the trunk.

24:02.990 --> 24:04.780
You know, she'll go up the river.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.640
Hey,you know I'm right.

24:06.660 --> 24:08.850
Oh,is that why you came in here?

24:08.880 --> 24:13.000
To harass me with your
positivism and your good mood,

24:13.030 --> 24:16.830
now that you're getting full
nights of uninterrupted sleep?

24:16.840 --> 24:19.970
Actually,no-- I came in
here to pass along a request.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.400
What kind of request?

24:21.430 --> 24:25.560
Well,apparently, it has not gone unnoticed
that,uh, you and I no longer share a bed.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.250
And this is incredibly awkward
for me, but,uh,it would appear

24:29.280 --> 24:33.120
that there's somebody else who
would like to sleep with you.

24:34.110 --> 24:36.430
Marie.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.250
Look what I've got.

24:53.050 --> 24:56.630
Looks great. I'm really not hungry.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.330
Oh,come on. Just a little bit.

24:59.340 --> 25:02.850
I've added lots of vitamins and
healthy stuff to the ice cream.

25:02.870 --> 25:04.990
Can't even taste how good it is for you.

25:05.010 --> 25:07.830
Go on,sweetheart, just a sip.

25:11.490 --> 25:15.400
They're coming this afternoon to
dig a hole for the swimming pool.

25:15.430 --> 25:17.990
Really? When will it be finished?

25:18.000 --> 25:23.020
In a couple of weeks. Just in time for you
to get your strength back and pay us a visit.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.320
- Here,Grandma,you finish it.
- No.

25:29.420 --> 25:32.010
Meredith,what on earth
is all that about?

25:32.650 --> 25:34.330
Phoebe has a fever,mother.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.530
Shouldn't be drinking
out of the same glass.

25:35.570 --> 25:37.950
Well,she always has a temperature.

25:37.980 --> 25:39.870
You and I are always around her.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.360
So clearly, she's not contagious.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.110
But we love you,Grandma.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.670
We don't want to take any
chances with your health.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.680
Right?

25:51.960 --> 25:54.180
Right.

26:05.140 --> 26:08.360
What? What-What's the
matter? You all right?

26:09.050 --> 26:11.600
I suddenly don't feel so good,Grandma.

26:11.630 --> 26:14.880
My stomach always
feels worse after I eat.

26:34.510 --> 26:35.890
Manuel.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.630
Louise.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.880
They pointed to this room,
but I wasn't sure if...

26:39.900 --> 26:41.700
You know Mrs. Dubois.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.310
Yes.

26:44.350 --> 26:45.770
Oh,you found your glasses.

26:45.810 --> 26:48.730
Oh,these? No,they're new.
The others never did turn up.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.510
- Well,they're lovely.
- Thank you.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.050
Please.

26:52.860 --> 26:57.510
So I'm sure you're curious why we
called you, asked you to come down here.

26:57.550 --> 27:00.300
Well,I was hoping that
you'd have some news.

27:00.330 --> 27:05.400
Although,I couldn't for the life of me
figure out why you,uh,called me and not Jim.

27:05.410 --> 27:09.890
Well,actually, there
is some news,of a sort.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.970
Are you familiar with Mrs. Dubois here?

27:12.020 --> 27:17.260
I know the two of you have spoken, but have
you heard about who she is,what she does?

27:17.290 --> 27:22.020
Well,I didn't when we first met, but,uh,my
husband told me about you this morning.

27:22.060 --> 27:24.540
Allison had a dream last night.

27:24.570 --> 27:25.970
It was about Meredith.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.350
You're kidding. W
- Where... did you see her? Where was she?

27:30.360 --> 27:33.960
I
- It wasn't that kind of dream. It was set in the past.

27:34.490 --> 27:38.030
Meredith was in it,you
were in it,Phoebe was in it.

27:38.070 --> 27:39.460
Phoebe?

27:39.490 --> 27:41.540
Meredith was taking care of her.

27:41.580 --> 27:46.220
You weren't convinced that what she
was doing was best for the child.

27:46.260 --> 27:50.350
Louise,the more time and effort we put
into investigating where Meredith is,

27:50.380 --> 27:54.490
the more we seem to be
discovering about who Meredith was.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.450
What she was capable of.

27:58.430 --> 28:02.230
Did you... encourage her to get away?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.820
Uh,help her in any way?
Perhaps give her some money?

28:08.230 --> 28:12.980
I'm... I'm sorry. This meeting is over.

28:15.210 --> 28:17.660
I know how you feel,Louise. I
have three daughters of my own.

28:17.670 --> 28:21.040
But you can't protect Meredith forever.

28:21.070 --> 28:24.680
Tell me,Mrs. Dubois, what would one of your
daughters have to do before you could say,

28:24.720 --> 28:27.680
"That's it,I'm done."

28:27.690 --> 28:30.930
I can't protect her anymore.

28:32.060 --> 28:35.710
I'm so sorry I couldn't have
been more... help to you both.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.120
Interesting schedule you're on.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.710
Think I'm quite the night
owl last couple of weeks.

28:58.730 --> 29:01.250
So will I be seeing you at my
little soiree tomorrow night?

29:01.290 --> 29:02.880
Lynn left me a voice mail.

29:02.930 --> 29:08.640
I know she's gonna be there, but a,uh, certain
police detective seems to be playing hard to get.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.800
What can I tell you?

29:09.830 --> 29:11.660
Well,you can tell me if
you're gonna be there or not.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.000
So if I show up at the last
minute, you're not gonna let me in?

29:14.030 --> 29:16.080
You never know.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.480
You guys okay?

29:19.760 --> 29:23.580
No,we're good. It's just,uh, something's
come up; I guess we have to deal with.

29:23.590 --> 29:28.060
Ihave to deal with. Have to
figure out how I feel about it.

29:28.070 --> 29:32.420
Think I was kind of hoping it'd just
go away, but it's not going anywhere.

29:32.430 --> 29:33.870
Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

29:33.910 --> 29:36.520
Are you kidding? I'm not
sureIknow what I'm talking about.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.980
You know the great
thing about being alone?

29:43.580 --> 29:46.420
There's no one to let down.

29:48.730 --> 29:51.510
So will I see you there?

29:52.410 --> 29:55.700
If I'm there, you
will definitely see me.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.450
She's covering for her. She's
absolutely covering for her.

30:01.460 --> 30:05.010
She gave her money, sent her
away someplace. I just know it.

30:05.020 --> 30:08.250
At one point, she actually admitted it.

30:08.280 --> 30:12.760
She asked me,"Is there anything one of your daughters
could do that would make you turn your back on her?"

30:12.770 --> 30:16.350
And you know,when she
asked that, I understood.

30:16.370 --> 30:19.890
If it was one of our children...

30:19.900 --> 30:24.280
Could you do it? Could you turn her in?

30:29.090 --> 30:31.710
Joe.

30:32.780 --> 30:35.400
Joe.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.140
What's going on?

30:39.150 --> 30:41.310
I'm confused.

30:41.350 --> 30:43.230
Didn't you say you've been
sleeping straight through the night?

30:43.270 --> 30:46.050
Yeah. Why?

30:46.060 --> 30:50.160
Well,you just,you just fell
asleep right here, right now.

30:51.080 --> 30:54.230
That doesn't make any sense.

30:57.430 --> 31:01.070
Maybe I should call that
doctor again in the morning.

31:01.110 --> 31:06.740
Well,I know our insurance isn't gonna cover it,
but I think maybe you should get a second opinion.

31:08.090 --> 31:11.330
Must be 115 out there today.

31:11.970 --> 31:16.870
Try not to let it hurt my feelings that you're
finally getting around to putting in a pool.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.620
15 years after I leave home.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.920
For a little girl who isn't
even really your granddaughter.

31:23.610 --> 31:24.600
You know I'm kidding.

31:24.660 --> 31:27.410
Oh,yes, I know you're kidding.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.260
I can't stay long. What'd
you want to talk about?

31:30.270 --> 31:32.390
I want to talk about Phoebe.

31:32.430 --> 31:36.170
I'm worried that she's
getting sick all the time.

31:36.210 --> 31:41.140
Fevers, stomachaches. I
- I spoke to some doctors who find it very puzzling.

31:41.150 --> 31:46.010
I mean,she has a, she has a heart
condition, not an immune deficiency.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.590
I don't know what to tell you,Mother.

31:48.630 --> 31:51.550
She's sick. She's sick a lot.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.130
Has been as long as I've
been taking care of her.

31:54.160 --> 31:57.450
I know,dear. That's why we
should get a second opinion.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.640
Then run some more tests.

31:59.650 --> 32:04.790
I mean,m-maybe there's something
that we can do that will help.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.190
No,I don't think so.

32:07.220 --> 32:10.000
I'm not putting Phoebe through that.
I'm not putting Don through that.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.230
- Meredith...
- I said no,Mother.

32:12.720 --> 32:15.080
Phoebe's not yours,she's mine.

32:15.110 --> 32:19.140
And I'll decide when and if
she needs to see more doctors.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.480
Is that it? Is that why I
came all the way over here?

32:23.490 --> 32:25.430
Because I really need to get home now.

32:25.470 --> 32:27.730
It's almost time for Phoebe's lunch.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.610
I'm so sorry,Meredith.

32:30.650 --> 32:35.170
Maybe there's something that I could've done
when you were a child, but I didn't see it.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.890
What are you talking about,Mother?

32:36.930 --> 32:39.480
Maybe your father and I
were-were too indulgent.

32:39.520 --> 32:43.930
You were an only child. You
were the center of our universe.

32:44.270 --> 32:49.120
And maybe, maybe you
were just born this way.

32:49.130 --> 32:52.270
Maybe you came into the world...

32:52.550 --> 32:54.700
with something missing.

32:54.750 --> 32:58.250
Something... crucially important.

32:58.260 --> 33:02.650
Well,at any rate,I am still your mother,

33:02.660 --> 33:06.220
and I need to take
responsibility for you.

33:06.570 --> 33:09.160
And I need to protect Phoebe.

33:09.210 --> 33:13.760
Phoebe? Why is everything
always about Phoebe?

33:17.390 --> 33:21.380
Mom... Oh,my God.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.100
Something's wrong. What's going on?

33:26.990 --> 33:31.940
Now,it's all right. It's all right,
sweetheart. Here,just sit here. Just relax.

33:31.950 --> 33:33.480
- Mom...
- It's okay.

33:33.490 --> 33:35.140
- Mommy,what's happening?
- It's all right.

33:35.150 --> 33:38.680
Just close your eyes. Close
your eyes. I'm here. I'm here.

33:38.690 --> 33:43.430
It's all right. Close your eyes.

33:43.670 --> 33:46.190
I'm right here.

33:47.310 --> 33:50.480
I love you.

34:09.090 --> 34:14.120
The great plays, the great movies, the great
books that have been written about family,

34:14.130 --> 34:18.830
they would all like you to believe
that blood is thicker than water.

34:18.850 --> 34:23.270
But in real life, a broken heart
can sometimes make blood run thin...

34:23.280 --> 34:24.030
Thank you.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.239
and water run thick.

34:27.250 --> 34:29.480
Mrs. Leaming?

34:31.260 --> 34:33.480
Well,good morning.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.570
I hope you don't mind. I tried to
ring the bell, but nobody answered.

34:36.949 --> 34:40.600
Oh,no,no,no. That's fine.
This is where the action is.

34:40.949 --> 34:44.120
What brings you by here
this morning,Mrs. Dubois?

34:44.159 --> 34:46.540
I had another dream last night.

34:46.550 --> 34:47.940
Really?

34:47.980 --> 34:51.690
You were in it. Meredith was in it.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.929
You were serving her iced tea.

35:00.300 --> 35:04.460
I have to tell the district
attorney what I know.

35:11.820 --> 35:15.870
I'd rather you didn't.

35:16.510 --> 35:21.350
But I'm confused. ut what
ur daughter was doing,****

35:21.360 --> 35:24.660
Because she's my daughter.

35:24.960 --> 35:30.230
I couldn't let Phoebe know
what Meredith had done to her.

35:30.240 --> 35:35.680
And I couldn't let my son-in-law
spend his life blaming himself.

35:36.550 --> 35:40.350
And my husband? No,no,no,no,no.

35:40.780 --> 35:43.580
I just couldn't do it.

35:44.150 --> 35:47.900
I need to protect Phoebe.

35:49.940 --> 35:54.460
This way, Meredith is... just gone.

35:54.470 --> 35:57.960
And everybody misses her,
and when they think of her,

35:57.990 --> 36:02.590
they think of a loving
wife, mother,daughter...

36:02.600 --> 36:05.700
that they believe that she was.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.880
Grandma.

36:20.940 --> 36:24.810
F
- For what it's worth, I don't...

36:24.820 --> 36:29.640
actually know where the body is. I
don't... I don't even know where to find it.

36:30.560 --> 36:34.940
Maybe there's not that much
to tell my boss after all.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.570
You do what you have to.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.680
I...

36:50.300 --> 36:52.140
Excuse me.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.730
Could you do me a favor and
give these to Mrs. Leaming.

36:56.740 --> 36:59.070
We're about to lay out the steel
framing for the swimming pool.

36:59.100 --> 37:01.660
And they were lying at
the bottom,in the dirt.

37:01.690 --> 37:05.380
- You found these at the bottom of the pool?
- Yeah.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.010
Where's your other half?

37:19.050 --> 37:21.440
Oh,doctor's office. He'll be here soon.

37:21.450 --> 37:25.280
You,uh,you see the
Leamings-- James,Louise?

37:25.310 --> 37:27.300
Why? Did you think
they'd really come here?

37:27.310 --> 37:29.180
No,not really.

37:29.230 --> 37:34.180
Not after all their family's been through; not
after the grilling we gave Louise yesterday.

37:34.210 --> 37:39.400
Still,in all, I feel badly. I feel
like I haven't been a very good friend.

37:39.650 --> 37:43.830
Sir,I think there's something I need to
tell you. Something I discovered today.

37:46.890 --> 37:50.830
Excuse me,Allison. Apparently I have
an urgent call. I'll be right back.

37:59.630 --> 38:02.990
<i>Just******</i>

38:30.140 --> 38:33.670
Sir. Will you be dining alone?

38:34.330 --> 38:37.020
Why,do I look lonely?

38:50.310 --> 38:53.630
- You'll never guess...I got a telephone call from James Leaming.
- There's something I really need to tell you about Louise Leaming...

38:54.450 --> 38:56.850
- What?
- Excuse me? No,you first.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.230
No,no,no,you first.
You said you got a call?

38:59.240 --> 39:01.750
I sure did-- from Councilman
Leaming and you won't believe it--

39:01.790 --> 39:03.730
they're on their way to
the hospital right now.

39:03.790 --> 39:05.760
A heart for Phoebe
just became available.

39:05.790 --> 39:07.830
They're flying it in
to Phoenix as we speak.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.600
That little girl's going
to get a transplant.

39:09.620 --> 39:11.590
- That's amazing news.
- Yeah.

39:11.600 --> 39:16.770
Jim said that Phoebe's elated,but
that Louise, Louise is over the moon.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.860
And what did you want to tell me?

39:23.900 --> 39:27.350
No,no,no,no. No,it's nothing.

39:46.810 --> 39:49.070
- Hey,stranger.
- Hey,stranger.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.290
Okay,so I'll ask. What's new?

39:53.300 --> 39:56.460
I don't know. So what's new with you?

39:58.260 --> 40:01.920
Congratulations!

40:04.370 --> 40:06.820
Congratulations,Lynn.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.670
You look great.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.430
Congratulations,Lynn.

40:30.650 --> 40:32.620
I'm an ass.

40:32.660 --> 40:36.080
A big ass. My ass.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.920
So what do we do now?

40:50.950 --> 40:54.580
How about we get through this as
quick as we can, so we can get home--

40:54.610 --> 40:57.530
have all those important
conversations that need to be had.

40:57.580 --> 41:01.540
All those important conversations
that keep being avoided.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.470
You here with anybody?

41:21.640 --> 41:23.830
You look happy.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.300
I like this new doctor.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.380
Oh,you do?

41:27.420 --> 41:31.160
Yeah,he's one of those old
guys-- real wise,really smart.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.510
So what did he say?

41:32.540 --> 41:36.020
You know,he said pretty much the
same thing that the first doctor said.

41:36.030 --> 41:39.440
He seemed to feel pretty
strongly that I'm sleep deprived.

41:39.820 --> 41:42.620
Yeah,so I told him all about you.

41:42.660 --> 41:43.950
I bet you did.

41:43.980 --> 41:47.500
Yeah,told him everything.
You know what he said?

41:47.810 --> 41:49.710
Oh,I can only imagine.

41:49.740 --> 41:54.600
He said that,"If I had a wife like that,
I would sleep with her every chance I got."

41:54.640 --> 41:58.030
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know,that's what I thought.

41:58.040 --> 42:00.410
So I said,"What about
the sleep deprivation?"

42:00.450 --> 42:04.250
You know what he said? He
said,"That's why God invented naps."

42:04.260 --> 42:06.730
- Really?
- Really.

42:07.060 --> 42:09.490
I like this new doctor.

42:09.500 --> 42:12.880
So,uh,so what are you saying? You
want to come home with me tonight?

42:12.890 --> 42:15.270
Maybe sleep together?

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
