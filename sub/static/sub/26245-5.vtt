14:37.277 --> 14:38.342
and she's innocent and all that

14:38.344 --> 14:40.344

she's gonna grow up,

14:40.346 --> 14:41.412

fucking sweet and innocent,

14:41.414 --> 14:42.412

the girls, I'll have the boys.

going to call him, anyway?

your kid sucking dicks

call the kid Quentin?

a blokey bloke, called Quentin.

fucking Quentin from--

16:18.177 --> 16:19.943

16:35.144 --> 16:37.611
in a fucking--
in a celebrity car race.

16:37.614 --> 16:39.413
They propped him up on some
books and he raced

16:39.449 --> 16:41.698

like at fucking good speeds.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.635
- Hmm.
Yeah, no, ah, you know.

16:44.770 --> 16:45.836
I mean he's not a blokey bloke.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.704
I mean you got a point
but, yeah.

a fucking point.
