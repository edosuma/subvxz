WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.632
Previously on Constantine...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.304
ANNE MARIE:
Something stole a baby,

00:04.505 --> 00:06.428
killed the mother.
It ripped into her.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.303
I need your help.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.009
Where are you?

00:08.217 --> 00:08.809
Mexico.

00:09.009 --> 00:09.384
What just happened?

00:09.593 --> 00:11.345
It's called bi-location.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.647
The power to be in two places
at the same time.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.144
How did you find me?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.396
EDDIE:
Our believers are everywhere.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.522
We will always find you.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.693
Time to go home now.

00:18.894 --> 00:19.816
No!

00:20.020 --> 00:21.021
What kind of demonic killer

00:21.230 --> 00:22.447
Walks into the house of God

00:22.648 --> 00:23.490
without breaking a sweat?

00:23.690 --> 00:24.691
Lamashtu.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.777
PIA: They're back.

00:26.985 --> 00:27.611
Who is, Mrs. Lopez?

00:27.819 --> 00:28.445
La Brujeria.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.281
You're working for the
Brujeria, why?

00:30.489 --> 00:31.661
They've figured out
how to break the boundary.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.866
Hell and Earth

00:33.075 --> 00:34.372
will become one.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.328
I'll bet your old mate, Pazuzu,

00:36.537 --> 00:37.663
sees it differently.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.629
(screeching)

00:40.832 --> 00:43.631
What is that? An lnvunche.
We can't outrun it.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.803
No, no, you shoot that gun,
it's gonna attack us for sure.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.802
No, John, it will attack you.

00:48.006 --> 00:48.802
(gunshot)

00:52.844 --> 00:54.721
(screeching)

00:57.057 --> 00:58.980
(groaning)

01:06.817 --> 01:08.194
He's safe.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.403
He's okay?

01:09.611 --> 01:10.533
He's okay.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.206
Go! Go, go, go, go.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.375
Here.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.420
Where's John?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.167
I'm sorry, Chas.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.925
Where's John?!

01:25.919 --> 01:28.718
I, John Constantine,
terminate all wards

01:28.922 --> 01:29.889
and protections.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.091
Igo lohannes Constantinus

01:31.300 --> 01:33.348
terminatur totum tutella.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.520
(screeching)

01:35.721 --> 01:36.893
(screams)

01:37.097 --> 01:39.395
(grunting)

01:42.769 --> 01:45.363
Quod praecipio...

01:45.564 --> 01:48.943
solacium capere daemonis...

01:49.151 --> 01:52.075
(screaming)

01:54.364 --> 01:55.991
(hissing)

02:01.413 --> 02:04.383
(growling)

02:04.583 --> 02:06.426
(bellows)

02:15.010 --> 02:17.479
"Ye cannot drink the cup
of the Lord

02:17.679 --> 02:19.898
"and the cup of the devil.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.520
"Ye cannot have part

02:21.725 --> 02:24.148
"in the Lord's table
and the table

02:24.353 --> 02:26.071
"of the devils.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.944
"Do we provoke the Lord
to jealousy?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.321
Are we stronger than he?"

02:30.525 --> 02:32.527
Oh, bloody hell.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.239
Have you lost all hope
in salvation, John?

02:35.447 --> 02:37.666
You invited a demon
into your body.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.709
It worked. He healed me.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.708
Of course it worked!

02:41.912 --> 02:44.415
The First of the Fallen
gives temporary power

02:44.623 --> 02:45.966
to those who believe his lies,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.133
but they become his possessions.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.802
Well, I didn't see God

02:49.002 --> 02:50.754
coming down that tunnel
to help me, or you.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.307
You didn't even ask, John.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.603
Instead, you sought
the help of a demon.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.680
It's all such a waste.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.936
You found the force
behind the rising darkness.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.484
We could've stopped it,
you and I together.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.858
You think I wanted this?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.814
You know what I think?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.945
To save yourself from hell,

03:11.149 --> 03:14.528
you acted without considering
the consequences.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.366
It's not that
I can't help you, John.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.375
I won't.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.957
(Sighs)

03:55.569 --> 03:57.116
(thunder rumbles)

04:02.075 --> 04:03.748
(indistinct praying)

04:08.373 --> 04:10.125
(QaSPs)

04:14.588 --> 04:16.214
MICHAEL:
Still experiencing the visions?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.845
Your father will be pleased.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.427
He didn't want
to do it this way.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.137
You forced his hand.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.471
That bastard should allow me

04:23.680 --> 04:25.057
To live my own life!

04:25.265 --> 04:27.734
(shouts)

04:27.934 --> 04:29.231
I'm not letting you take me
back there!

04:29.436 --> 04:31.154
It's a waste of time.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.532
Stop it! Why?

04:34.733 --> 04:37.077
Afraid I might actually
get through?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.120
(bellowing)

04:39.321 --> 04:40.197
(screams)

04:41.281 --> 04:43.375
(tires squealing)

04:53.710 --> 04:55.087
(bellowing)

04:56.713 --> 04:58.306
(screams)

05:01.927 --> 05:04.680
You spend enough time
with a magician,

05:04.888 --> 05:06.811
you learn a few tricks.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.819
Your father...

05:11.019 --> 05:12.771
he'll never stop.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.151
My father?

05:14.356 --> 05:15.482
I'd rather die

05:15.690 --> 05:16.942
before I'll ever

05:17.150 --> 05:18.993
go back there!

05:19.194 --> 05:21.196
(bellowing)

05:22.823 --> 05:24.496
(car door closes, engine starts)

05:34.251 --> 05:36.128
CHAS: John!

05:38.463 --> 05:39.931
John!

05:40.131 --> 05:41.804
Oh. Ah, Chas.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.555
What happened?

05:43.760 --> 05:44.932
It's bad.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.262
It's really bloody bad.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.018
Let's get out of here.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.817
(groans)

05:51.017 --> 05:53.145
Anne Marie, she made it out
all right, then?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.650
She seemed fine.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.107
The question is,
what happened to you?

05:56.314 --> 05:57.907
She's quick on her feet,
our girl.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.781
She used the copper's gun.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.408
She left me behind to stall
the hungry lnvunche.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.659
Annie shot you?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.116
A bloody nun.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.745
It's a new low.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.668
Can't say
I didn't deserve it, though.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.792
How'd you survive the lnvunche?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.215
The only way I, I could.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.167
I cast off
my spiritual protections,

06:15.375 --> 06:16.843
invited the demon,

06:17.043 --> 06:18.920
Pazuzu, in to take my body
for a spin.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.676
Unholy bastard's

06:20.881 --> 06:22.849
first order of business

06:23.049 --> 06:24.676
was to heal its host.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.728
You're possessed by a demon.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.602
I feel surprisingly good.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.399
Demonic permeation's like a flu.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.944
There's an incubation period
between first infection and...

06:34.144 --> 06:36.272
full-on possession.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.526
I figure I got

06:37.731 --> 06:39.483
a couple of days

06:39.691 --> 06:41.159
before it takes up
permanent residence.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.032
John, stop.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.204
What if you can't get it out?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.954
Well, then you'll just have to
finish what Anne Marie started.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.752
Kill me.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.875
You can't ask me to do that.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.205
(chuckles)

06:54.414 --> 06:56.041
It's all right, mate.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.968
I've been carrying hell around
with me my whole life.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.591
How much worse

07:00.795 --> 07:01.762
can the actual place be?

07:01.963 --> 07:03.010
We're not there yet.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.090
What's your plan?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.346
More of a...

07:05.550 --> 07:07.097
gamble.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.646
Self-exorcism.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.314
You're kidding? (grunts)

07:11.514 --> 07:13.187
I wish I was.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.893
I need my bag.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.569
We need to move fast.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.568
An exorcism for an exorcist.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.240
Let's do it.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.317
(groaning)

07:24.361 --> 07:25.704
John?

07:25.904 --> 07:27.622
(growling)

07:30.700 --> 07:32.919
You can beat this.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.542
John, fight it!
(distorted): Chas!

07:35.747 --> 07:38.546
I can't. John, fight it!

07:41.002 --> 07:43.050
(distorted):
I will not be cast out!

07:49.344 --> 07:51.267
(groaning)

07:52.847 --> 07:54.440
He cast a demon
into his own body?

07:54.641 --> 07:55.858
CHAS:
Well, he didn't have a choice.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.606
He was dying.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.529
I still can't believe Anne Marie
actually shot him.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.697
I had a vision of her, Chas.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.115
She was in pain,

08:03.316 --> 08:04.693
racked with guilt.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.027
Well, John always could

08:06.236 --> 08:07.453
push her buttons.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.997
So, what are you going to do?

08:09.197 --> 08:10.494
Assuming I can find him,

08:10.699 --> 08:12.201
John has a contingency plan,

08:12.409 --> 08:14.787
but I don't think
I can pull it off on my own.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.463
He already lost control once.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.960
I know it's asking a lot,

08:18.164 --> 08:19.336
but I could really use
your help.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.337
Zed?

08:23.545 --> 08:24.637
Zed, you there?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.182
(Panting)

08:27.382 --> 08:28.634
Yeah.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.640
I'll be on
the first flight down.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.393
Hopefully we can find him
before he hurts someone else.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.238
(helicopter blade whirring)

08:42.438 --> 08:43.155
(QaSPs)

08:43.356 --> 08:45.199
(shouting in Spanish
over bullhorn)

08:46.526 --> 08:48.403
(sirens wailing)

08:51.364 --> 08:53.241
(Spanish continues)

09:05.003 --> 09:06.676
Oh, bloody hell.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.686
(crowd chattering)

09:32.822 --> 09:35.120
Mr. Constantine.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.453
Stanley Gibson
with the British Consulate.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.082
Yeah, skip the formalities,
mate.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.756
Just get me the hell
out of here, yeah?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.758
According to the police,

09:47.962 --> 09:50.590
you were assaulted
by a street gang

09:50.799 --> 09:53.018
known as the Santa Muerte.
Saint Death.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.095
The unholy comforter to a
legion of gangsters and hit men.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.055
It's clear self-defense.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.607
Just show me where to sign,
and I'll be on my merry way.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.230
Mr. Constantine,

10:01.434 --> 10:03.232
regardless of their pedigree,

10:03.436 --> 10:04.858
you are responsible
for the death

10:05.063 --> 10:06.235
of five Mexican nationals.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.612
The investigation itself
could take weeks.

10:08.817 --> 10:09.818
Bollocks to that, mate.

10:10.026 --> 10:10.993
I need out of here tonight.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.491
That's not my call.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.322
You don't understand
the sheer screaming hell

10:14.531 --> 10:15.999
that's gonna
rain down around here!

10:16.199 --> 10:17.951
- Guard!
- So start pulling some bloody strings!

10:18.159 --> 10:19.752
Guard!

10:19.953 --> 10:22.752
This meeting was a courtesy.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.048
You poncey, bloody windbag.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.626
Get me the hell out of here!

10:25.834 --> 10:27.677
(speaking Spanish)

10:35.593 --> 10:37.470
(speaking Spanish)

10:41.307 --> 10:43.605
Still no sign of John?

10:43.810 --> 10:44.982
I've been driving around
all morning,

10:45.186 --> 10:46.358
but in this city,
it's like looking

10:46.563 --> 10:49.567
for a needle
in a thousand haystacks.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.118
Hey, you think it's possible

10:52.318 --> 10:54.036
the demon's already taken over?

10:54.237 --> 10:56.865
John gave himself a couple days.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.871
But he's prone
to overconfidence.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.827
What happens if he can't
get it out in time?

11:01.035 --> 11:02.833
His consciousness is pushed out.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.835
Permanently.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.758
His soul is delivered to hell,
and that demon's freed on Earth.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.133
It's Pazuzu, the Assyrian god
of famine, locusts and storms.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.135
As John would say,
it's bloody awful.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.716
But it won't come to that.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.392
Why not?

11:16.593 --> 11:19.312
Because he wants me
to kill him first.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.980
Hey.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.900
Anne Marie, she
found him before,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.317
using bi-location.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.735
She can do it again.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.734
Given she just shot him,

11:28.938 --> 11:30.360
I'm not sure that's an option.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.532
It will be.

11:31.733 --> 11:32.700
When I'm clone with her.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.302
(speaks Spanish)

12:06.184 --> 12:07.185
(speaks Spanish)

12:07.393 --> 12:08.485
Nice business you're running.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.733
You speak English?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.319
If it pays.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.695
What's it to you?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.277
You seem like the kind of bloke

12:15.485 --> 12:16.953
who knows how things work
in this nick.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.996
And I'm willing to
pay for an education.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.709
Name's Julio.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.503
Follow me.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.973
Was it something I said?

12:38.174 --> 12:39.551
JULIO: They're Santa Muerte.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.976
CONSTANTINE: Are they now?

12:41.177 --> 12:43.396
Feos bastardos have
the run of the prison.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.564
They're sworn to avenge
the death of their brothers.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.982
The ones you killed.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.856
They're the least of my worries.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.858
Have you got a light?

12:51.062 --> 12:52.860
Those things will kill you.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.941
(chuckles)

12:55.149 --> 12:57.823
I thought you'd washed
your hands of me.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.449
You know, I got to admit,

12:59.654 --> 13:02.123
I never thought you'd
do anything this stupid.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.245
I'm John Constantine.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.871
I do stupid in spades.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.249
And how are you feeling?

13:07.453 --> 13:10.957
Like I've got a bloody
marching band in my skull.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.886
Sorry I put a crimp in
your grand game plan.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.303
Are you honestly telling me

13:16.504 --> 13:18.302
that none of you
cloud-huggers had any clue

13:18.506 --> 13:19.974
that the Brujeria were back in business?

13:20.174 --> 13:22.176
You know,
some evil is so powerful,

13:22.385 --> 13:23.807
it can hide from heaven itself.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.231
Lamashtu wasn't working alone.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.853
The Brujeria have
other operatives

13:28.057 --> 13:30.276
working close at hand.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.854
Identifying the enemy
was always the first step

13:33.062 --> 13:35.110
in defeating
the rising darkness.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.113
Well, if this goes pear-shaped,

13:37.317 --> 13:38.785
then I guess you'll
have to find yourself

13:38.985 --> 13:40.032
a new operative on the ground.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.455
Not many like you
down here, John.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.872
Manny.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.871
Yes, John.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.255
I'm not ready to die.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.258
Are you afraid
of what's waiting for you?

13:54.459 --> 13:57.383
No, I earned what
I got coming to me.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.430
I just...

14:02.175 --> 14:03.973
I have more work to do.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.647
Then that makes this a crucible.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.225
And for the sake
of the mortal realm,

14:10.433 --> 14:12.902
I hope you find what you need.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.648
What if I don't know
what I need?

14:18.024 --> 14:18.900
(Sighs)

14:19.108 --> 14:19.904
(chuckles)

14:20.109 --> 14:21.361
Crazy Inglés.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.947
I can get you anything you want.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.203
Drugs, women.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.081
Does this prison have anything
that resembles a chapel?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.583
Come on.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.894
You always were a
good friend, Chas.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.893
We need to talk.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.316
There's nothing to talk about.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.393
He threatened the
life of an infant.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.648
Annie...

14:54.852 --> 14:55.899
He would have sacrificed
it without blinking.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.777
So when the choice was mine,

14:57.980 --> 15:00.779
I sacrificed him instead.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.826
John isn't dead.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.740
But how?

15:06.948 --> 15:09.918
He cast a demon... into himself.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.495
Pazuzu...

15:11.702 --> 15:12.874
That's not a demon,

15:13.079 --> 15:14.797
it's a demon king.

15:14.997 --> 15:18.046
He's trying to fight it,
but if we don't find him fast...

15:18.251 --> 15:19.468
Typical selfish wanker.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.467
Selfish?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.639
You're the one who put
a bullet in his chest.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.217
He's just trying
to save his life.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.927
While risking the lives

15:27.135 --> 15:28.933
of everyone around him,
including yours.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.560
That's our decision... we chose
to join him in this fight.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.529
The rising darkness, is it?

15:38.729 --> 15:40.982
I hate to burst your bubble,
but the Roman Catholic Church

15:41.190 --> 15:42.533
have been fighting
that for centuries.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.407
It's why I joined the convent.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.034
Except they know right
from wrong here.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.742
We all serve a higher power,
but John...

15:50.950 --> 15:52.497
Talks to an angel.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.376
What did you say?

15:55.580 --> 15:58.379
His name is Manny.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.960
He came to John for help.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.221
You kneel here,
night after night,

16:04.422 --> 16:06.140
hoping against hope

16:06.340 --> 16:08.138
that heaven hears your words.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.343
Well, guess what.

16:09.552 --> 16:13.227
John has heaven on speed dial.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.229
Someone up there thinks
he's worth a damn,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.060
and now he's dying
because of you.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.236
CHAS: She's telling the truth.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.815
You need to help us find him.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.616
GIBSON: What are you
doing in my office?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.994
And how did you
get past security?

16:31.199 --> 16:32.542
Does it matter?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.540
I was eager to hear

16:34.744 --> 16:36.121
what you learned
about the man who was taken

16:36.329 --> 16:38.081
into custody last night.

16:38.289 --> 16:41.919
He's a Brit, all right.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.925
Bit of a checkered past.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.052
Name's John Constantine.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.054
Anything else?

16:49.258 --> 16:50.180
The man clearly has

16:50.384 --> 16:52.261
no respect for the Crown.

16:52.470 --> 16:56.225
The rest of what I found
is in there.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.060
As per our arrangement,

16:59.268 --> 17:02.067
I fixed it so that
he won't be leaving the prison

17:02.271 --> 17:03.614
any time soon.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.452
So, what's this fellow to you?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.871
A self-righteous impediment
to the inevitable.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.868
Too blind to see that
the Brujeria's darkness

17:12.073 --> 17:13.790
cannot be stopped.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.380
(chuckles nervously)

17:19.579 --> 17:20.797
I'm sorry,

17:20.998 --> 17:22.875
but why do you keep looking
at me like that?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.339
Not looking.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.847
Measuring.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.424
(screams)

17:36.681 --> 17:38.604
(screams)

17:43.771 --> 17:45.023
Hey, lunético.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.278
What is it you're looking for?

17:46.482 --> 17:48.280
Purified honey wax, holy water,

17:48.484 --> 17:50.361
full-Iength mirror
would be very useful.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.368
This isn't gonna
make much sense,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.370
but I'm meaning to
conduct a self-exorcism,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.326
purge a demonic entity.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.660
(chuckles)

17:57.868 --> 17:59.666
Many demons in a
place like this.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.840
Sadly, mine's more
than a rusty metaphor.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.008
CONSTANTINE:
Bloody Santa Muerte.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.018
No honor amongst thieves, then?

18:15.219 --> 18:16.596
That...

18:16.804 --> 18:18.101
and los asesinos paid better.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.933
(door opens)

18:20.141 --> 18:21.893
JULIO: Sorry, Inglés.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.771
Five of my brothers are dead.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.825
And you're all alone, puta.

18:30.026 --> 18:33.621
You really don't want
to do this.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.574
(groans)

18:36.782 --> 18:39.786
I'm hosting a monster that
doesn't take kindly to threats.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.122
And if you poke it,
it's gonna kill you

18:42.330 --> 18:44.128
the same way
as it killed your brothers.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.133
Get back! He's mine!

18:49.337 --> 18:51.135
You stupid bloody git.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.091
You're setting it loose.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.646
(all screaming)

19:16.113 --> 19:17.956
(QaSPs)

19:18.157 --> 19:20.000
(groans)

19:30.961 --> 19:32.008
(sighs)

19:35.675 --> 19:36.972
Where's Julio?

19:40.680 --> 19:41.977
No.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.229
(screams) I had to!

19:44.433 --> 19:46.310
It's the only way to stay alive!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.362
They run this place!

19:51.691 --> 19:54.490
Now I run this place!

19:54.694 --> 19:56.537
Now sod off!

20:02.410 --> 20:03.957
You'll do exactly as I tell you.

20:04.161 --> 20:07.290
Start by telling me
everything you saw last night.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.125
I only saw after it was over.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.882
The Santa Muerte were dead.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.556
You truly have a devil inside.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.100
I'm just trying to keep it
inside this prison.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.928
As long as I'm in here,
I can't cast it out.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.858
All it has to do
is watch the clock go down.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.946
Si, now bugger off.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.708
Chas got in touch, then.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.251
And your new friend, Zed.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.750
She's a true believer, that one.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.627
I almost feel sorry for her.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.208
Oh, yeah? And why's that?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.293
You'll find a way
to disappoint her.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.923
Sooner or later.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.222
If she lives long enough.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.845
Why'd you come here, Annie?

20:59.049 --> 21:00.346
I promised them I'd find you.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.598
I believe they intend
to rescue you.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.400
Did you really take
the Pazuzu inside?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.610
After you shot me,

21:17.818 --> 21:19.616
lest we forget.

21:19.820 --> 21:23.165
What are you going to do if
you can't get the demon out?

21:23.365 --> 21:26.710
Only thing I can do.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.709
If it's any consolation,

21:28.913 --> 21:31.086
I am ready to pay for my sins.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.133
What is this, another con?

21:33.334 --> 21:34.301
No con.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.100
I'm lost here, Annie.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.019
In that case, I'll pray for you.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.856
Good-bye, John.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.227
Good luck.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.369
(guards, people talking)

22:00.569 --> 22:02.571
This is where
Anne Marie found him.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.578
Even if we get in,
I'm still not sure

22:04.782 --> 22:06.329
what we'll be able
to do for him.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.002
John's more prepared
than even I realized.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.419
You're gonna have to sneak
a couple things in.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.712
Yeah.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.342
(Constantine chants
in foreign language)

22:14.542 --> 22:17.170
Assyrian exorcism rite.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.595
How did he know
he'd need that exact spell?

22:18.796 --> 22:20.343
He didn't.

22:20.548 --> 22:21.845
That recorder has
John reciting exorcism rituals

22:22.049 --> 22:23.096
in 50 different languages.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.394
Ceremonial

22:25.594 --> 22:27.221
Tibetan Phurba.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.147
Is that part of the ritual, too?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.645
I hope not.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.443
If John can't exorcise
the demon himself,

22:32.643 --> 22:33.769
this will definitely
do the trick.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.151
So why don't we just use this?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.982
CHAS: Using that means

22:38.190 --> 22:40.158
plunging that blade
into John's heart.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.657
If that demon gets
the best of him,

22:42.862 --> 22:43.954
that's what John wants us to do.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.036
(0K3)!-

22:47.241 --> 22:48.333
Figure out how
you're getting in?

22:48.534 --> 22:49.581
Yep.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.332
Over there.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.914
CHAS: They look like hookers.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.248
ZED: That's 'cause they are.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.925
I grew up near
a prison like this.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.548
I know exactly

22:58.752 --> 23:00.425
how they work.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.256
CHAS: See you on the inside.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.559
(people speaking Spanish)

23:09.513 --> 23:11.015
(guard speaks Spanish)

23:12.558 --> 23:13.650
(exhales)

23:19.023 --> 23:21.276
(women clamoring)

23:22.860 --> 23:23.952
CHAS: Excuse me. Pardon me.

23:24.153 --> 23:24.824
Pardon me.

23:25.029 --> 23:25.746
(speaking Spanish)

23:25.946 --> 23:27.198
Hi.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.453
Hola. Um...

23:28.657 --> 23:29.749
Hmm? I need to...

23:31.285 --> 23:32.457
Aw, screw it.

23:32.661 --> 23:33.878
(grunting)

23:45.174 --> 23:47.597
Official business for El Diablo.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.772
You have a conjugal visit.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.066
Well, I can't really say
I'm in the mood, mate.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.518
(exhales)

23:57.978 --> 23:59.070
Oh...

23:59.271 --> 24:00.568
I know what it looks like.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.447
Don't get any ideas.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.904
You took a hell of a risk,
sneaking in here like this.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.363
Bright spot like you

24:07.571 --> 24:08.993
should know better.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.620
Thought you could use a friend.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.417
(QaSPs)

24:12.618 --> 24:14.871
No. No, no!

24:15.079 --> 24:16.922
(breathing raggedly)

24:19.750 --> 24:22.845
Demon wants to sow his oats.

24:23.045 --> 24:26.049
So far, it's only been
able to take control

24:26.256 --> 24:27.849
when it's under threat, but...

24:28.050 --> 24:29.723
it's wheedling its
way in like a tick.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.100
I won't be able to hold it back
much longer.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.147
(laughs)

24:35.307 --> 24:37.685
I made a mistake, Zed.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.112
We can fix it, okay?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.438
As soon as Chas gets here,

24:41.647 --> 24:42.694
we'll get that thing out of you.

24:42.898 --> 24:43.945
I-I brought the

24:44.149 --> 24:45.822
recorder with your spells

24:46.026 --> 24:46.572
and-and the holy water...

24:46.777 --> 24:47.369
No.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.788
This is my fight,
from here on out.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.115
(door opens)

24:53.075 --> 24:54.622
It's our fight.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.626
Does this mean that
we're friends again?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.091
How did you get in?

25:01.291 --> 25:02.838
I told the guards that
one of their prisoners

25:03.043 --> 25:04.545
was in need
of spiritual comfort.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.755
Even a place like this
respects the cross.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.092
Better put this on.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.676
A nun's habit?

25:10.884 --> 25:14.309
White shirt, black pants.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.232
Figured you could use a change.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.610
It's good to have you back, luv.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.989
I need to know...

25:32.197 --> 25:34.199
should I be scared?

25:34.408 --> 25:35.910
For John, I mean?

25:36.118 --> 25:37.665
He's in a bad way.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.295
But John believes he has
every situation under control,

25:41.498 --> 25:43.466
and he makes you believe.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.295
That's his magic.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.755
And his curse.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.562
Zed, if we make it through this,

25:55.763 --> 25:57.982
you should leave him
and never look back.

25:58.182 --> 26:01.777
I wish someone had
given me that advice.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.589
It's arranged.

26:22.790 --> 26:23.666
We'll be left alone.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.718
All right.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.640
Tie me down.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.935
Make it nice and tight.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.208
(Constantine chanting
Assyrian exorcism)

27:03.664 --> 27:06.087
Our help is in
the name of the Lord,

27:06.291 --> 27:08.214
who has made heaven and earth.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.045
The Lord be with you.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.302
(exorcism chant continues)

27:12.506 --> 27:14.099
The Lord be with you.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.556
The Lord be with you.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.979
What's wrong?

27:27.187 --> 27:28.564
At this stage of demon
possession, the holy water

27:28.772 --> 27:30.365
should cause a violent reaction.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.318
It's been too long.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.028
It's in me too deep.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.488
(men yelling outside,
crashing noises)

27:37.239 --> 27:38.582
(man screams)

27:39.992 --> 27:41.335
What's going on out there?

27:41.535 --> 27:44.254
(hissing)

27:44.454 --> 27:45.626
The Brujeria,

27:45.831 --> 27:49.586
they are not happy
with you, John!

27:49.793 --> 27:50.919
Identify yourself!

27:51.128 --> 27:52.846
I've been known as Nahash,

27:53.046 --> 27:54.093
the Trickster,

27:54.298 --> 27:55.595
and now as Vicente.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.472
And you know me as you know all

27:57.676 --> 27:59.178
earthly temptation.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.387
He's the tempter.

28:00.596 --> 28:01.392
The original serpent

28:01.597 --> 28:02.439
from the Garden of Eden.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.891
So, what have

28:04.099 --> 28:05.601
the Brujeria promised you, then?

28:05.809 --> 28:06.901
VICENTE: No promises.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.979
They gave me release,

28:09.188 --> 28:11.737
so I could rain darkness
down on your...

28:11.940 --> 28:13.317
sinful world.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.402
I came to end your life!

28:15.611 --> 28:16.828
But now I can see

28:17.029 --> 28:18.747
what a mistake that would be.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.666
In a short matter of time,
you won't be my enemy...

28:21.867 --> 28:23.585
you'll be my ally.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.128
Annie, the knife.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.421
You have to end this

28:26.622 --> 28:27.874
HOW.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.799
(screams, grunts)

28:30.000 --> 28:32.549
I can't stop it, Annie!

28:32.753 --> 28:33.595
Do this now, or...

28:33.795 --> 28:34.637
No, you'll die!

28:34.838 --> 28:35.464
He knows.

28:35.672 --> 28:36.423
(grunts)

28:36.632 --> 28:37.724
No, don't!

28:39.343 --> 28:40.686
Anne Marie...

28:47.684 --> 28:48.810
(guards shouting in Spanish)

28:49.019 --> 28:50.396
Hands UP!

28:50.604 --> 28:52.026
(shouting in Spanish)

28:52.231 --> 28:53.403
GUARD: Arriba! Now!

28:59.404 --> 29:01.657
(grunting, snarling)

29:11.500 --> 29:12.251
(Panting)

29:12.459 --> 29:13.210
(exhales)

29:15.379 --> 29:17.632
I wasn't sure it would be
you coming back.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.557
I'm hanging by a thread here.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.135
Where's Zed?

29:21.343 --> 29:23.311
She managed to get outside
during the alarm.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.514
I talked the guards
into letting me stay with you.

29:25.722 --> 29:28.942
That knife was your one way out.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.439
You should've clone it, Annie.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.817
And what would your angel say?

29:33.021 --> 29:34.568
Probably would've
shaken your hand.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.196
CHAS (grunting):
Could use a hand!

29:37.401 --> 29:39.199
Ah, it's alive.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.201
Might want to get
him out of there.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.624
It's hot as hell
in these things.

29:43.824 --> 29:44.871
Welcome back.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.122
CHAS: So...

29:46.326 --> 29:47.999
what's the new plan, John?

29:48.203 --> 29:49.705
There is...

29:49.913 --> 29:50.960
no new plan, mate.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.711
There's no time left

29:52.916 --> 29:54.463
for a straight-up exorcism.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.762
What about the Mill House?
Jasper's defenses

29:56.962 --> 29:58.009
might weaken the entity enough

29:58.213 --> 29:59.260
for the ritual to work.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.761
That might work,

30:00.966 --> 30:02.764
but even if we could
get John out of here,

30:02.968 --> 30:04.436
- that's a 24-hour drive.
- Ah, I'd never make it.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.559
This demon's ready
to claw its way out.

30:06.763 --> 30:07.855
Well... unless we can
slow it down.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.103
Look for sedatives,

30:09.308 --> 30:11.310
sleeping pills.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.065
CONSTANTINE:
That's the right idea,

30:13.270 --> 30:15.443
but it's the wrong dose. Chas...

30:15.647 --> 30:16.899
I need you to track down

30:17.107 --> 30:20.987
a guy named Julio.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.836
You found him.
Does he have what we need?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.917
Yeah. Once the prisoners
found out it was for John,

30:35.125 --> 30:36.627
they became a coalition
of the willing.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.712
How much were you able
to get your hands on?

30:40.130 --> 30:41.723
JULIO:
This is everything they had.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.140
That's enough heroin
to kill a herd of elephants.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.559
Well, let's hope it's enough

30:44.760 --> 30:46.808
to tamp down a bloody Pazuzu.
(groans)

30:47.012 --> 30:48.013
Be right back.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.521
All right, cook it up.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.147
Oh...

30:58.648 --> 30:59.900
Are you sure you can do this?

31:00.108 --> 31:01.030
If there's anything I've learned

31:01.234 --> 31:02.531
in the last 48 hours,

31:02.736 --> 31:03.828
it's that this demon
needs me alive.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.372
And if you're wrong?

31:05.572 --> 31:07.040
Well, then, I'll go out riding

31:07.240 --> 31:09.413
the world's greatest high.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.872
With my first love at my side.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.169
There are worse ways
to meet your maker, eh?

31:22.339 --> 31:23.682
CHAS: All right, let's
get him out of here.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.351
No time like the present.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.643
Do it.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.943
See you in hell, lunético.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.661
CHAS: Now,

31:52.869 --> 31:54.416
time for phase two.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.504
CHAS: Almost there.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.180
Hold on, hold on.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.849
This isn't gonna work.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.301
I'm the guy who broke
that guard's nose.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.679
(exhales)

32:10.887 --> 32:12.104
(inhales deeply)

32:12.305 --> 32:13.807
ANNE MARIE: Excuse me! Anyone!

32:14.015 --> 32:15.062
Uh, can you help me?

32:15.267 --> 32:15.642
Please?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.770
Uh, I've been robbed.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.980
Please, they stole my clothes.
Can you help me?

32:20.188 --> 32:21.815
Oh, Anne Marie...

32:22.023 --> 32:23.491
ANNE MARIE: Please help me! Hey!

32:23.692 --> 32:24.488
Do you understand me?
Do you know what I'm saying?

32:24.693 --> 32:26.161
(speaks Spanish)

32:26.361 --> 32:27.408
Excuse me! Could you help me?

32:27.612 --> 32:28.864
I know. Please?

32:29.072 --> 32:30.790
Please, just bring me something?

32:30.991 --> 32:32.709
I have been robbed.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.206
Please?

32:34.411 --> 32:36.334
I know, I know.
Please. Thank you.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.710
Um, does anyone speak English?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.758
Do you have a coat, please?

32:44.004 --> 32:44.971
(guards shouting)

32:45.172 --> 32:46.640
(tires squealing)

33:02.481 --> 33:04.984
Figure we could use
some space for this.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.569
I'll take care of him.

33:06.776 --> 33:07.948
You two start gathering
what we need.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.075
Look for religious icons.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.280
(0K3)!-

33:15.076 --> 33:17.249
I know you want to be here,
Zed, but an exorcism

33:17.454 --> 33:19.582
is dangerous.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.588
I've seen what happens
when they go wrong.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.261
Darkness seems to find me
wherever I am.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.640
Something happened to you
while John was gone, didn't it?

33:33.220 --> 33:35.097
They found me.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.478
I've been on the run from
people who want to use my gift

33:37.682 --> 33:40.276
for their own reasons.

33:40.477 --> 33:43.731
They tried to take me back
to a place

33:43.939 --> 33:47.318
I swore I'd never go back to.

33:49.194 --> 33:50.787
CONSTANTINE (groans): Annie.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.285
Annie!

33:55.867 --> 33:57.494
It's got to be you.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.045
What?

33:59.246 --> 34:00.623
They can't use
the tape recorder.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.956
We both know Pazuzu won't listen

34:02.165 --> 34:04.714
to a wanker like me.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.842
It's gonna take a voice
with true spiritual conviction

34:08.045 --> 34:08.797
to pull this off.

34:09.005 --> 34:09.755
The Roman Catholic ritual?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.091
John, I'm a novice.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.471
The sanctioned ritual requires

34:12.676 --> 34:13.302
a fully ordained priest.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.181
Oh, we both...

34:14.386 --> 34:17.230
We both know
that there's an exception,

34:17.429 --> 34:20.855
if you've experienced
a divine epiphany,

34:21.059 --> 34:23.777
seen proof of the existence
of heaven and hell.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.482
If what you endured
at Newcastle doesn't do it,

34:26.690 --> 34:27.987
then I don't know what does.

34:28.190 --> 34:29.659
Annie, listen.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.076
Listen.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.905
I need you to do this.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.080
You have the strength.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.998
You shot me to save
those babies.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.667
I just need you to summon it up

34:37.867 --> 34:39.494
just one last time.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.295
Annie, please.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.623
(grunting)

34:45.500 --> 34:47.719
(growling)

34:47.918 --> 34:50.092
You're our only hope.

34:50.297 --> 34:53.176
At least try.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.224
(Sighs)

34:58.430 --> 35:00.307
(Sighs)

35:05.270 --> 35:07.944
Bloody John Constantine.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.860
Center of attention again.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.753
This demon will try to use
our weaknesses against us.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.383
If it emerges,

35:31.588 --> 35:33.386
don't listen to it.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.013
It won't be John.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.015
I hope I can tell
the difference.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.064
Lord have mercy.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.441
CHAS AND ZED: Lord have mercy.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.114
ANNE MARIE:
All holy saints of God,

35:49.314 --> 35:50.987
intercede for us.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.693
CHAS AND ZED: All holy saints
of God, intercede for us.

35:52.901 --> 35:53.993
(screaming)

35:54.194 --> 35:55.537
From all evil,

35:55.737 --> 35:56.738
deliver us.

35:56.946 --> 35:57.947
From all sin,

35:58.156 --> 35:59.624
from your wrath,

35:59.824 --> 36:00.916
from sudden

36:01.117 --> 36:02.164
and unprovided death,

36:02.369 --> 36:04.542
from the snares of the devil,

36:04.746 --> 36:05.872
from anger, hatred,

36:06.081 --> 36:07.298
and all ill will.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.796
That's right, you bastard,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.843
it bloody hurts.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.512
From lightning and tempest,

36:12.712 --> 36:15.215
from the plague, famine and war.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.390
John, you need to keep fighting.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.968
Annie, Annie.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.268
Annie, Annie.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.062
It-it...

36:21.262 --> 36:22.479
It's not working,
it's not working.

36:22.681 --> 36:23.603
You need to... untie me.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.605
There's another way.

36:25.809 --> 36:26.355
I found another way, Annie.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.151
(0K3)!-

36:27.352 --> 36:28.945
It's if you untie me...

36:29.145 --> 36:30.192
(bellowing)

36:30.397 --> 36:31.899
(screams)

36:32.107 --> 36:33.359
She's losing it!

36:33.566 --> 36:36.115
The demon's not heeding
my commands...

36:43.993 --> 36:45.210
(distorted laughter)

36:50.250 --> 36:51.627
That's right,

36:51.835 --> 36:52.961
novice.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.263
Give up, like you did
when you ran

36:55.463 --> 36:56.885
to Mexico.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.138
Only don't blame Newcastle.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.891
You're the failure, Annie.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.688
The shriveled nothing

37:03.888 --> 37:07.313
who only felt alive

37:07.517 --> 37:09.190
in John Constantine's shadow,

37:09.394 --> 37:10.190
barely worth

37:10.395 --> 37:12.818
his one night of pity.

37:13.022 --> 37:13.898
Annie, it's not John!
Don't listen to him!

37:14.107 --> 37:14.949
And you, Chas,

37:15.150 --> 37:18.199
the mindless lackey,

37:18.403 --> 37:20.201
losing your family,

37:20.405 --> 37:23.158
even your precious daughter.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.209
Ancl all because

37:25.410 --> 37:27.754
of the freak that he made you.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.001
Stop it, John!

37:29.205 --> 37:30.252
Why stOp now?

37:30.457 --> 37:31.800
Mary.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.673
You came crawling to him

37:33.877 --> 37:34.799
for his council

37:35.003 --> 37:36.550
as he dragged you

37:36.755 --> 37:38.507
into eternal darkness

37:38.715 --> 37:39.967
that you can never escape.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.051
Annie crawled to her convent

37:41.259 --> 37:42.932
and you'll do the same

37:43.136 --> 37:47.607
as you go crawling back
to your daddy.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.775
When this one's purged,

37:49.976 --> 37:51.899
I'll razor your eyes

37:52.103 --> 37:52.899
and feed them to the fallen

37:53.104 --> 37:54.401
and the damned.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.950
And all because of you!

37:57.150 --> 37:59.027
Because you just didn't
have it in you.

38:00.236 --> 38:03.206
(bellowing)

38:03.406 --> 38:06.034
Annie, you have
to complete the ritual!

38:08.244 --> 38:09.416
He's too powerful!

38:09.621 --> 38:11.498
My faith isn't strong enough.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.334
I can't save him.

38:21.925 --> 38:22.426
(bellowing)

38:22.634 --> 38:23.135
I can't save him!

38:23.343 --> 38:25.892
I can't. CHAS: Zed!

38:26.095 --> 38:27.972
It's not the demon that's
preventing the exorcism,

38:28.181 --> 38:30.024
it's you. No, I tried.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.818
I saw a vision.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.861
Your hatred and your rage.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.281
You make your own prison.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.234
The ritual needs for you to
believe that John can be saved.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.365
You have to find
a way to forgive.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.116
Crawl back to your convent,

38:43.321 --> 38:44.698
you craven whore!

38:44.906 --> 38:46.249
Where you think

38:46.449 --> 38:47.701
you're safe.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.582
I have forgiven him, I swear.

38:49.786 --> 38:50.912
Not him, you.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.417
You have to forgive yourself.

38:52.622 --> 38:53.794
You feel guilty

38:53.998 --> 38:55.841
for introducing him to magic,

38:56.042 --> 38:58.340
for creating John Constantine.

38:58.545 --> 38:59.637
I can't hold him!

39:00.922 --> 39:02.014
Whatever damage he's done,

39:02.215 --> 39:03.888
whoever he's hurt,

39:04.092 --> 39:05.890
was never because of you,

39:06.094 --> 39:09.098
but if John dies
and this demon is released,

39:09.305 --> 39:11.023
that failure will be
yours, Anne Marie.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.727
Oh, my God.

39:16.396 --> 39:17.898
Filthy hell spawn,

39:18.106 --> 39:19.779
leave this vessel

39:19.983 --> 39:20.950
and be gone.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.948
I command you

39:23.152 --> 39:24.574
to release John Constantine,

39:24.779 --> 39:26.201
this humble servant

39:26.406 --> 39:28.158
of God!

39:28.366 --> 39:29.367
(bellowing continues)

39:29.576 --> 39:31.249
Go back to hell, beast!

39:31.452 --> 39:33.830
Back to the filth
that spawned you!

39:34.038 --> 39:36.917
This one is not yet ready
for your embrace.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.422
(screaming)

39:38.626 --> 39:41.300
Forgive him
his trespasses, Lord,

39:41.504 --> 39:43.256
and protect your servant
from this abomination.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.887
Return to hell

39:46.092 --> 39:47.435
and the fiery pit

39:47.635 --> 39:49.103
where you belong!

39:50.430 --> 39:52.307
(bellowing stops)

39:56.352 --> 39:59.947
(softly): John'? John?

40:00.148 --> 40:01.149
John, are you...

40:01.357 --> 40:03.359
are you, are you all right?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.991
(groans)

40:06.195 --> 40:07.492
Far from it.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.746
But I'm free of it,

40:10.950 --> 40:12.497
and that's on you.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.293
And I don't know about you lot,

40:16.497 --> 40:18.875
but I could murder
a bloody drink.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.005
(chuckles)

40:20.209 --> 40:21.131
All right.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.022
You have to tell him.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.193
About what happened

40:38.394 --> 40:40.317
and these people from your past.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.149
I was hoping to put them
behind me.

40:43.358 --> 40:46.328
But I guess
you're probably right.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.049
Like I said, there's no reason

41:00.249 --> 41:02.251
for you to hurry off
down south so soon.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.389
We always made a great pair,

41:07.590 --> 41:09.058
you and me.

41:09.258 --> 41:12.512
Seems we've both grown up a bit
since then.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.064
You know, I probably never got
the chance to say this,

41:15.264 --> 41:17.938
but, uh...

41:18.142 --> 41:20.065
I know what I put you through,

41:20.269 --> 41:22.112
and, uh...

41:22.313 --> 41:24.691
I'm sorry.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.776
No, you're not.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.487
(chuckles)

41:28.695 --> 41:30.242
John Constantine
doesn't do sorry.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.911
Pity it took me

41:33.116 --> 41:34.959
almost 20 years
to figure that out.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.635
Uh, I've got this one, mate.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.810
I put you guys
through the ringer on this one.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.433
I suppose if I was to offer
my thanks,

41:54.637 --> 41:56.014
you wouldn't believe me, either.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.144
Probably not.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.770
Not for a second.

41:58.975 --> 42:00.397
Well, if you're sticking around
for the ride,

42:00.601 --> 42:02.069
you better buckle up.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.147
What we turned up in Mexico
is just the start.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.574
We're poking a stick
at an evil, the likes of which

42:06.774 --> 42:08.822
the world hasn't seen
in centuries.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.617
(chuckles)
