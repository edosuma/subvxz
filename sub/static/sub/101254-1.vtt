WEBVTT

01:46.980 --> 01:49.783
Ayah, we're leaving now.
Ayah!

01:51.617 --> 01:54.854
- Bring the car round! Please!
- Yes, sir.

01:58.690 --> 02:02.328
- Jemima?
- Ayah. Get the suitcase!

02:02.362 --> 02:04.965
Can you sleep?

02:04.998 --> 02:08.201
Now!

02:08.233 --> 02:10.604
Are you scared?

02:11.904 --> 02:13.273
Don't be.

02:15.808 --> 02:17.744
Shall I tell you a story?

02:20.880 --> 02:24.351
There were once two people
called Rama...

02:26.351 --> 02:27.987
and Sita.

02:29.821 --> 02:31.857
And they loved each other.

02:35.028 --> 02:37.798
They spent their days
dancing and singing together.

02:39.832 --> 02:41.301
Grrr!

02:41.333 --> 02:44.870
And then Sita was kidnapped
by the evil demon Ravana.

02:44.904 --> 02:47.708
Grrr!

03:13.231 --> 03:14.800
Ayah?

03:16.903 --> 03:19.339
Ayah? Ayah!

03:40.025 --> 03:41.327
Father?

03:43.029 --> 03:44.331
Daddy?

03:51.036 --> 03:53.239
Time for our nap, Jemima.

04:13.191 --> 04:17.430
There were once two people
called Mary and Jemima.

04:20.266 --> 04:23.003
They spent their days
telling stories to each other.

04:25.504 --> 04:27.506
And then one day,

04:27.540 --> 04:30.376
their mother and father
were kidnapped

04:30.408 --> 04:32.812
by the evil demon Ravana...

04:37.283 --> 04:39.453
...leaving them all alone.

05:32.170 --> 05:36.542
As I understand it, her mother was
struck down with cholera very suddenly.

05:36.576 --> 05:39.045
Her father rushed her mother
to hospital.

05:39.078 --> 05:43.016
She died that night,
her father the following morning.

05:43.049 --> 05:45.084
She can't stay here.

05:45.117 --> 05:48.153
Well, she has
an uncle in England.

05:48.187 --> 05:50.790
We'll send her back
with the other children.

06:39.304 --> 06:41.174
It's disgusting.

06:42.374 --> 06:44.444
Then you're gonna be
very hungry.

06:44.477 --> 06:46.412
I never said
you could do that.

06:46.444 --> 06:50.884
You didn't say I couldn't.
If you weren't eating it, I will.

06:50.917 --> 06:54.220
You don't understand.
I need better food than this.

06:54.252 --> 06:56.521
My parents are dead.

06:56.554 --> 06:58.591
We've all lost, girl.

07:00.091 --> 07:02.060
Would you
like to hear a story?

07:02.093 --> 07:04.196
No. I'm not a kid.

07:07.566 --> 07:10.536
There once
was a lord of the seas.

07:10.569 --> 07:13.340
His name was Varuna, and...

07:16.341 --> 07:17.543
he...

07:21.079 --> 07:22.514
I'm not a kid.

08:06.624 --> 08:10.529
You are a plain little
piece of goods, aren't you?

08:13.699 --> 08:15.335
Don't expect luxury.

08:16.134 --> 08:18.503
Misselthwaite is not
the place it was.

08:18.536 --> 08:24.176
Those army savages used it as a
hospital in the war, left it a wreck.

08:28.414 --> 08:30.383
Don't you care?

08:30.415 --> 08:32.583
Does it matter
if I care or not?

08:35.554 --> 08:37.957
You are an odd duck, aren't you?

08:48.067 --> 08:49.569
Is that the sea?

08:49.602 --> 08:51.603
No, it's the moors.

08:51.636 --> 08:54.741
Nothing lives on
but wild ponies and sheep.

09:04.750 --> 09:08.221
And there you have it.
That's home.

09:08.788 --> 09:10.724
That's Misselthwaite.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.228
And don't expect him
to come running, your uncle.

09:16.261 --> 09:18.164
He's had better days.

09:18.197 --> 09:20.667
And you're not to stare
when you see what afflicts him.

09:41.786 --> 09:46.626
First things first,
we are fully electric.

09:47.459 --> 09:49.661
That doesn't mean
the electric always works.

09:49.694 --> 09:54.566
So, if you're needing the lavatory
in the night, you take a lamp.

09:54.599 --> 09:58.771
Secondly, Mr. Craven is
a widower and on his own.

09:58.804 --> 10:01.741
He's promised he'll have someone
to tend to you soon enough.

10:01.774 --> 10:05.545
But until then, don't be expecting
there'll be people to talk to,

10:05.578 --> 10:07.280
'cause there won't.

10:08.213 --> 10:12.218
I need no entertaining.
I'm not a child.

10:14.453 --> 10:15.788
Hmm.

10:15.820 --> 10:19.591
You'll be told
what rooms you can go into,

10:19.625 --> 10:22.361
and what rooms
you're to keep out of.

10:22.394 --> 10:27.133
But until then, you stick to
your rooms and your rooms only.

10:27.165 --> 10:32.104
No exploring, no poking about.

10:33.771 --> 10:35.775
I assure you, Mrs. Medlock,

10:35.808 --> 10:38.144
I've no interest
in "poking about."

10:40.246 --> 10:41.646
Hmm!

11:23.655 --> 11:24.824
Mother?

11:25.591 --> 11:30.597
I'm climbing.
Mother, look. Please!

11:42.741 --> 11:44.177
Hello?

11:57.423 --> 11:59.259
Is anybody there?

12:40.799 --> 12:42.268
Hello?

12:44.703 --> 12:46.439
Is someone there?

13:05.623 --> 13:08.493
No, sir.
Please, leave those.

13:09.361 --> 13:11.598
The army will come
and collect them.

13:12.598 --> 13:14.333
Come on.

13:15.367 --> 13:16.769
Come inside.

13:26.978 --> 13:28.347
Who are you?

13:28.380 --> 13:30.516
What's that for a greeting?

13:30.549 --> 13:33.920
You'll call me Martha.
And you're Mary, I hear.

13:39.724 --> 13:43.963
Brrr! Quite chilly today,
but spring is on its way.

13:43.996 --> 13:46.966
That's what my brother Dickon says.
He's always out on the moor.

13:46.998 --> 13:50.402
I was cold in the night
and no one heard my call.

13:50.435 --> 13:52.271
I'm guessing
we were sleeping too.

13:53.205 --> 13:57.944
And I heard noises.
Wailing. Screaming.

13:59.410 --> 14:01.814
No, you heard the wind,
that's all.

14:01.847 --> 14:04.317
My Ayah would come
if I needed her.

14:04.349 --> 14:06.785
Whoever Ayah is,
she's sure as not here, is she?

14:08.386 --> 14:10.689
But aren't you going to be
my servant?

14:14.593 --> 14:16.695
I'm just
to check the fire's lit,

14:16.728 --> 14:19.398
the room's shipshape
and you've had food in you.

14:20.933 --> 14:23.636
Come on, get up and ready.
Your porridge is getting cold.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.509
I don't eat porridge.

14:30.541 --> 14:32.477
For my breakfast,
I like bacon and eggs.

14:32.511 --> 14:36.049
I like 'em too.
But you've got porridge. Now, eat.

14:37.116 --> 14:39.352
But you need to dress me.

14:42.154 --> 14:45.491
Dress you?
Do you not know how?

14:46.724 --> 14:49.961
Me mother always says she can't
see why grand people's children

14:49.995 --> 14:53.466
didn't turn out to be fools,
what with being washed and dressed

14:53.498 --> 14:55.801
and took out to walk
as if they were puppies.

14:58.536 --> 15:01.740
And there I was, excited to
have a young 'un in the house.

15:14.786 --> 15:17.756
It doesn't matter!
This is of no importance.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.593
We can't just leave them
all piled up like this.

15:20.626 --> 15:23.129
Well, get rid of them! Throw them away.
Burn them. I don't care!

15:24.563 --> 15:26.699
The house will be better
without them!

15:29.468 --> 15:33.005
What about this one?
Please, I don't need to be reminded of her.

15:34.906 --> 15:36.376
She's gone.

16:12.578 --> 16:15.148
One, two...

16:19.083 --> 16:21.119
Thirty-one...

16:21.152 --> 16:23.755
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight...

16:28.926 --> 16:32.431
Seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight...

16:33.665 --> 16:36.468
Hello?

16:42.940 --> 16:44.776
Are you Martha's brother?

16:49.047 --> 16:50.149
Come back!

17:35.726 --> 17:36.795
No!

17:52.844 --> 17:57.316
There you are.
Now you're fed. You can go now.

18:00.251 --> 18:02.154
Don't you dare.
It's far too close!

18:05.957 --> 18:08.226
I want you to go!

18:24.643 --> 18:26.078
Of all the silly things.

18:27.745 --> 18:29.213
Are you following me?

18:32.050 --> 18:35.687
Mary! Mary?

18:35.721 --> 18:39.124
Do you have a problem
with wild dogs on this manor?

18:39.156 --> 18:42.660
It is not a manor,
it is an estate.

18:42.694 --> 18:45.731
Of course we don't have
a problem with wild dogs.

18:45.763 --> 18:47.567
You're not
in the colonies now.

18:51.002 --> 18:56.140
And in future, your bath
will be ready at 5:25,

18:56.174 --> 18:59.679
and you'll be expected
to be in your room by then.

19:38.684 --> 19:41.953
Ayah,
please keep her quiet!

20:07.244 --> 20:09.247
Were you here
when the soldiers were?

20:10.214 --> 20:11.951
Did you work in the hospital?

20:19.491 --> 20:21.761
Soldiers died here, didn't they?

20:33.370 --> 20:35.873
Please don't.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.775
You spoil the carpet
and your dress

20:37.809 --> 20:39.912
and it'll be me
has to clean both.

20:42.213 --> 20:45.050
The noises that
I hear in the night,

20:45.082 --> 20:48.019
do dead soldiers
haunt this house?

20:48.052 --> 20:51.089
If you hear noise,
then turn over and sleep more.

20:52.389 --> 20:54.259
I didn't ask to be here!

20:56.427 --> 20:59.030
And Mr. Craven didn't ask
to take you in,

20:59.063 --> 21:01.399
but he did all the same.

21:23.855 --> 21:24.890
Mrs. Pitcher?

21:26.323 --> 21:28.727
You gave me a sandwich
yesterday, for my luncheon.

21:29.561 --> 21:31.896
I need the same meat
in my sandwich today.

21:34.566 --> 21:35.835
Please?

22:06.397 --> 22:07.933
There you are.

22:14.138 --> 22:15.273
Hello.

22:15.307 --> 22:17.476
What's your name, then?

22:20.511 --> 22:23.848
Are you a girl dog or a boy dog?

22:27.184 --> 22:29.354
I think that you're a girl dog

22:29.386 --> 22:31.889
and I'm going to call you Jemima.

22:31.923 --> 22:33.425
Come on, Jemima!

23:07.959 --> 23:09.495
Wait for me!

23:13.932 --> 23:17.001
Where are you taking me? Jemima!

23:34.286 --> 23:36.488
So this is where you live.

23:36.521 --> 23:38.890
Mary!

23:38.924 --> 23:41.894
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mary!

24:53.498 --> 24:55.000
I saw you.

24:59.203 --> 25:02.139
I can't say I saw enough
to identify you,

25:02.173 --> 25:05.410
but I'm sure if I were to say
the little servant girl,

25:05.443 --> 25:08.146
you'd be in firm trouble,
wouldn't you?

25:09.213 --> 25:11.015
I'm no servant.

25:11.683 --> 25:14.019
My name is Mary Lennox.

25:14.051 --> 25:16.687
My mother was sister to
the mistress of this house

25:16.721 --> 25:20.058
and my uncle owns it still, and you'll
do well to give me the respect I'm due.

25:20.090 --> 25:25.597
I'll give you none. I'm Colin Craven
and the uncle you speak of is my father.

25:25.629 --> 25:28.367
If I were to live,
this place should belong to me.

25:29.334 --> 25:30.703
We're cousins.

25:32.369 --> 25:33.571
But I've
never heard of you.

25:33.605 --> 25:35.274
Nor I of you.

25:39.344 --> 25:40.679
You're very thin.

25:40.712 --> 25:42.780
You're very white.

25:42.813 --> 25:44.782
You smile with no teeth.

25:44.816 --> 25:46.485
Well, you don't smile
at all.

25:46.518 --> 25:47.685
Why are you here?

25:47.719 --> 25:49.254
Why shouldn't I be?

25:49.287 --> 25:51.556
I don't want a friend.

25:51.588 --> 25:54.659
I've plenty already.

25:57.162 --> 25:59.431
So you're the one
that cries at night.

25:59.463 --> 26:01.399
I thought this cursed house
was magic...

26:01.433 --> 26:03.368
You think the house cursed?

26:04.702 --> 26:07.071
By all the soldiers
that died here.

26:07.771 --> 26:11.577
No. The curse came
before the war.

26:12.444 --> 26:15.347
The reason they say
this house is cursed

26:15.379 --> 26:19.251
is because it killed my mother
and tried to kill me.

26:22.654 --> 26:26.657
My mother's dead too.
And I killed her.

26:27.392 --> 26:28.427
Did you really?

26:31.463 --> 26:35.567
Well, then we both
know tragedy... don't we?

26:45.542 --> 26:47.412
Daddy!

27:12.870 --> 27:14.839
Wake up, girl.

27:14.873 --> 27:16.575
The master wants to see you.

27:20.845 --> 27:23.448
Come on, girl,
you can help more than you are.

27:23.481 --> 27:27.352
My mother would say you do
as little as fast as you can.

27:27.385 --> 27:29.754
I have decided
that I like your mother.

27:30.788 --> 27:34.659
You've never met her. Eat.

27:34.692 --> 27:38.130
I like your brother Dickon too,
and I have met him.

27:38.163 --> 27:42.200
Well, I would have, but he backed away.
I've seen him, at least.

27:42.232 --> 27:45.471
Dickon has problems enough of his
own without you to bother him.

27:47.405 --> 27:49.774
Don't worry, he won't like me.
No one does.

27:51.509 --> 27:53.545
And how do you
like yourself?

27:54.578 --> 27:56.580
Mother said that to me once.

27:56.614 --> 27:59.751
Put her in a bad temper and
she turns on me and she says,

27:59.783 --> 28:02.853
"There tha' stands saying tha'
doesn't like this one an' tha'.

28:02.886 --> 28:04.556
How does tha' like thysel'?"

28:04.588 --> 28:07.358
Not that I want to interrupt
this reminisce,

28:07.392 --> 28:09.561
but there are those
who are waiting on us.

28:09.594 --> 28:11.663
Mrs. Medlock, I'm sorry...
It's not her fault.

28:12.530 --> 28:16.635
I was tardy.
She was scolding me for it.

28:18.636 --> 28:21.306
Well, it doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

28:21.338 --> 28:24.376
What matters is you're late.
Now, come on with you.

28:27.945 --> 28:32.583
Now, when he speaks to you,
you answer back with a "sir."

28:32.617 --> 28:35.953
Do you understand?
Yes, Mrs. Medlock.

28:35.986 --> 28:37.955
And if he wants to look at you,

28:37.989 --> 28:40.858
you let him look,
but don't stare back.

28:41.792 --> 28:45.229
And say nothing fanciful.
He's enough concerns.

28:48.966 --> 28:51.235
Come here, girl.

28:59.944 --> 29:02.848
Into the light,
where I can see you.

29:06.451 --> 29:09.588
Mrs. Medlock says
you're cluttering up the place.

29:10.355 --> 29:12.656
She'd have me
send you away to school.

29:12.690 --> 29:16.361
I don't want that, sir.
I like it here.

29:17.595 --> 29:19.631
Then we will find you
a governess.

29:19.664 --> 29:22.434
No. I've no need
of a governess.

29:26.037 --> 29:28.840
I've too much to learn here
at Misselthwaite, sir.

29:33.645 --> 29:35.713
This place
has nothing to teach you.

29:42.353 --> 29:44.889
I want to play
out of doors.

29:44.922 --> 29:46.857
It was too hot
to do so in India.

29:46.890 --> 29:48.792
I'm obliged by law
to have you taught.

29:48.826 --> 29:50.896
Then we'll need to
break the law, won't we?

30:00.838 --> 30:03.575
Mrs. Medlock says
she sees your mother in you.

30:05.376 --> 30:06.944
I'm not so sure.

30:06.978 --> 30:10.916
Did she like my mother?
Doesn't seem to like me.

30:15.353 --> 30:17.055
It's not your mother I see.

30:17.088 --> 30:19.925
You see her twin.
Your wife.

30:21.526 --> 30:23.629
My mother
said the same once.

30:32.036 --> 30:35.774
If you do cause me trouble, I will have
you sent away to school in an instant.

30:35.807 --> 30:36.908
Do you understand?

30:39.609 --> 30:42.580
All women are destined to leave
Misselthwaite, one way or another.

30:44.848 --> 30:46.484
Go on, off you go.

30:49.119 --> 30:52.523
I'm not to be sent to school
and I'm not to have a governess.

30:52.557 --> 30:55.894
- Are you not?
- Mr. Craven's orders.

30:55.926 --> 30:59.430
He doesn't want me to leave this cursed
house like all the other womenfolk.

31:00.732 --> 31:04.636
Please be sure to have Mrs. Pitcher
supply me with her special sandwiches.

31:04.668 --> 31:08.105
Extra meat.
It is a requirement.

31:08.138 --> 31:10.309
I need to grow.

31:16.713 --> 31:17.948
Hello.

31:20.684 --> 31:21.986
Jemima!

31:23.788 --> 31:25.390
Jemima!

31:31.863 --> 31:33.064
Jemima.

31:40.538 --> 31:41.772
No.

31:44.142 --> 31:45.977
Please don't.

32:08.698 --> 32:09.733
No!

34:07.752 --> 34:09.688
Jemima?

34:57.234 --> 34:58.670
Jemima?

35:07.010 --> 35:08.112
Jemima!

35:20.758 --> 35:22.627
Hello.

35:23.928 --> 35:25.797
This is a mysterious place.

35:26.763 --> 35:28.932
Come back and we'll get
that wound better for you.

35:30.767 --> 35:32.903
The trap wasn't my fault.

35:37.274 --> 35:38.343
Very well.

36:12.443 --> 36:14.245
Can I see your paw, Jemima?

36:16.113 --> 36:18.249
I promise I won't hurt you.

36:22.352 --> 36:24.921
You don't want help?
That's fine.

36:24.955 --> 36:27.892
We'll deal with that later.

36:27.925 --> 36:29.961
We'll have an explore first.

36:43.006 --> 36:45.876
Keep up, Jemima.

36:55.185 --> 36:58.321
There were once two friends
called Mary and Jemima,

36:58.354 --> 37:00.857
and they discovered
a mysterious garden.

37:41.164 --> 37:44.034
Hello to you too.

37:44.068 --> 37:47.171
No, don't hurt him.
It's just a friendly robin.

38:03.854 --> 38:05.890
What is it?

38:19.068 --> 38:21.038
That's as good an idea
as you've had.

38:39.923 --> 38:41.325
Mary!

38:42.827 --> 38:44.896
I'll be back tomorrow
to see to that leg.

39:17.193 --> 39:18.862
Mary!

39:20.631 --> 39:22.000
Mary!

39:28.638 --> 39:30.008
But...

39:31.609 --> 39:34.412
you've dirt all over you,

39:34.444 --> 39:38.816
and your hair's matted
and wet.

39:39.584 --> 39:43.354
Mr. Craven said to play.
I'm playing.

40:02.272 --> 40:04.207
Colin...
No!

40:04.240 --> 40:06.443
Lie still.
No, please.

40:06.477 --> 40:09.881
I don't like it.
It tastes horrid, please!

40:09.914 --> 40:13.450
I know you don't like
it, but it's going to make you well.

40:13.484 --> 40:16.254
- Please. Please!
- You know very well,

40:16.287 --> 40:19.390
it's either the medicine
or the brace.

40:21.292 --> 40:25.363
Come on.
It'll soon be over. Just...

40:25.396 --> 40:27.964
Please!
I don't like it.

40:27.997 --> 40:29.966
It tastes horrid.
I don't like it.

40:29.999 --> 40:32.402
I'll come back
later when you've calmed down.

41:00.129 --> 41:04.935
Sometimes I need to be
restrained, or medicated.

41:05.702 --> 41:08.338
My father says
it's for my own benefit.

41:08.372 --> 41:11.142
Although I rarely see him.
He's always too busy.

41:14.678 --> 41:16.380
I thought
you wouldn't visit again.

41:16.412 --> 41:18.115
That's your chair?

41:18.147 --> 41:20.483
It's none of your business!
Don't touch it!

41:20.517 --> 41:25.556
Oh, it's good. Moves well.
Do you use it much?

41:25.589 --> 41:29.627
I'm afraid I can't.
You've seen my father's hunchback.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.729
Well, mine is worse.
I've never been able to walk.

41:31.761 --> 41:33.964
Shall we use the chair
to explore? I can push...

41:33.997 --> 41:35.300
Your cousin is dying.

41:39.435 --> 41:41.405
You don't look like
someone who's dying.

41:41.437 --> 41:43.407
And how many dying people
have you seen?

41:45.475 --> 41:48.646
We could go outside and, who
knows, you might feel better.

41:48.678 --> 41:50.714
Once they tried
to take me outside,

41:50.747 --> 41:53.316
and the stench of the roses
almost killed me.

41:53.350 --> 41:57.655
You're afraid of flowers?
That isn't very sensible.

42:08.265 --> 42:12.002
What if I were to tell you
that I know of a magical place?

42:12.035 --> 42:13.436
Where the birds
sing for you

42:13.470 --> 42:15.071
and a friendly dog
plays with you?

42:15.104 --> 42:17.507
I'd say that you were lying.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.075
And I'm not interested,

42:19.109 --> 42:20.544
even if you are
telling the truth.

42:20.577 --> 42:22.546
But...
I'm tired now. You can go.

42:23.479 --> 42:24.647
What?

42:24.680 --> 42:26.349
I'm tired.

42:26.383 --> 42:28.519
You're not listening to me.
Please leave.

42:28.551 --> 42:31.155
I'm not your play toy to be
put down when you choose!

42:31.187 --> 42:32.689
You came to me.
I never invited you in.

42:32.722 --> 42:35.158
I told you secrets
about my magic place.

42:35.191 --> 42:37.327
Secrets I didn't care
to know of.

42:38.162 --> 42:39.564
Now get off my bed
and leave me alone.

42:54.711 --> 42:56.513
Is that your mother?

42:56.546 --> 42:58.215
You were leaving.

43:00.484 --> 43:02.453
They say I look like her.

43:02.486 --> 43:05.423
I hate her for doing it.
Dying.

43:06.122 --> 43:07.457
Hate her?

43:08.392 --> 43:12.562
My mother loved me hugely.
Everyone said so.

43:15.198 --> 43:18.702
And then she died,
leaving me all alone.

43:20.571 --> 43:22.306
It's unforgivable.

43:24.307 --> 43:26.143
Well, my mother
never loved me.

43:27.711 --> 43:31.816
Will you read to me?
As I try to fall asleep?

43:31.848 --> 43:33.584
I struggle to sleep.

43:35.151 --> 43:37.088
I know...

43:37.120 --> 43:39.189
I'll tell you a story
about gods

43:39.222 --> 43:40.690
and a quarrel
over who first made fire.

43:40.723 --> 43:42.526
That sounds terrible.

43:44.227 --> 43:45.562
Read me this.

43:45.595 --> 43:48.131
What are you laughing about?

43:48.164 --> 43:50.534
You might be the rudest boy
I've ever met.

46:48.312 --> 46:49.613
Perfectly all right.

46:49.646 --> 46:51.515
But you've not eaten anything.

46:51.548 --> 46:53.251
Please don't fuss!

46:55.618 --> 46:59.289
Martha, can you tell me
about my Aunt Grace?

46:59.323 --> 47:01.759
Your mother didn't talk
of her sister at all?

47:02.926 --> 47:04.962
She never talked of England.

47:07.430 --> 47:08.932
Thick as thieves, they were.

47:09.867 --> 47:12.303
<i>The crying I heard
when it was announced</i>

47:12.336 --> 47:14.638
<i>your father
was to be posted to India.</i>

47:17.473 --> 47:19.843
I served at the last ball
they had here.

47:24.046 --> 47:26.617
To see them dance...

47:26.649 --> 47:28.952
This house
was filled with light,

47:28.984 --> 47:31.921
laughter, happiness.

47:36.993 --> 47:38.862
Your poor mother.

47:38.894 --> 47:41.498
I don't know how
she coped to lose her.

47:45.535 --> 47:47.605
I don't think
she ever recovered.

47:49.805 --> 47:51.941
Mummy,
I have a new story for you.

47:51.975 --> 47:54.578
No, darling,
I just need to be alone.

47:57.013 --> 47:59.950
- Mommy!
- Please go away!

47:59.982 --> 48:01.718
Come on, Miss.
Mother!

48:01.752 --> 48:04.688
Mary! Mary, please, darling,
leave your mother in peace.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.490
Why won't she see me?
What's wrong with me?

48:07.524 --> 48:10.694
She's just sick, that's all.

48:10.727 --> 48:13.597
Then why doesn't she get on and
die, leave us all alone?

48:25.609 --> 48:27.544
You needn't trouble with
dressing me this morning.

48:27.577 --> 48:29.080
I can manage.

48:33.015 --> 48:34.584
Jemima?

48:38.821 --> 48:39.923
Jemima!

48:43.727 --> 48:44.795
Dickon?

48:46.729 --> 48:47.997
Stop!

48:51.435 --> 48:52.937
I know it's you, Dickon.

48:56.807 --> 48:59.443
And unless you want me to instruct
your sister to box your ears...

48:59.475 --> 49:01.979
My sister loves me
much more than you.

49:02.011 --> 49:05.048
She won't love you so much when she
knows you're poaching on the moor.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.149
Poaching?

49:08.084 --> 49:09.653
I were not.

49:13.990 --> 49:17.127
You ran from me.
That says guilt.

49:17.160 --> 49:19.663
Guilt for what you did
to my Jemima.

49:20.597 --> 49:22.966
I'm not sure your dog
would like the name Jemima,

49:22.999 --> 49:24.968
being as he's a boy.

49:25.001 --> 49:27.136
A boy? It doesn't matter.

49:27.169 --> 49:29.106
His paw was trapped
in a horror trap.

49:29.138 --> 49:30.874
Tell me where I'd find him.

49:32.175 --> 49:33.843
Why should I trust you?

49:33.877 --> 49:35.679
I know how
to make him better.

49:35.711 --> 49:36.980
Trust that.

49:39.216 --> 49:40.951
I need you to keep a secret.

49:43.720 --> 49:45.122
On my honor I'll keep it.

49:49.158 --> 49:51.194
Why have you
just spat on yourself?

49:51.227 --> 49:55.732
You spit too. Then we shake.
Then we're bonded.

49:57.533 --> 49:59.769
If you're too much of a lady, then there's no...

50:00.604 --> 50:01.806
I'm no lady, sir.

50:15.185 --> 50:18.055
And it's my secret,
so you're to keep it.

50:18.088 --> 50:20.156
You're just here
to help with the dog.

50:29.932 --> 50:30.967
Wow.

50:32.968 --> 50:34.070
This way!

50:41.678 --> 50:43.747
Can you do this?

51:02.164 --> 51:03.199
Look at this.

51:15.644 --> 51:16.879
Hello, fella.

51:17.981 --> 51:20.183
How'd you get here?

51:20.216 --> 51:22.019
Master not come back
from the war?

51:22.051 --> 51:24.088
Do you think
he lost his home?

51:28.725 --> 51:29.927
I'll do you no harm.

51:32.963 --> 51:34.031
Hey...

51:40.870 --> 51:42.873
What are you doing?
You tricked me.

51:42.906 --> 51:44.708
Hold the head.
This was all a trick!

51:44.740 --> 51:46.776
If we don't see to this now,
he'll lose his leg,

51:46.810 --> 51:48.812
and chances are, his life.

51:52.214 --> 51:53.783
Careful, now.

51:56.352 --> 51:57.620
He trusts you.

51:58.988 --> 52:02.258
Nothing's broken,
but it looks like it's going rotten.

52:02.292 --> 52:04.127
Is there running water here?

52:28.984 --> 52:30.588
That's really good, that.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.402
Feel better, does it, sir?

52:49.439 --> 52:50.941
Up.

53:02.285 --> 53:04.021
Dickon, you haven't
fixed anything.

53:04.854 --> 53:07.690
You've made it worse.
Just give it time.

53:07.723 --> 53:09.091
Both of you.

53:09.124 --> 53:10.793
We've done all we can.

53:14.164 --> 53:16.734
We're hoping the garden
will magic him well?

53:17.934 --> 53:19.403
Come morning,
we'll have an answer.

53:30.146 --> 53:35.185
It has a lake? You wouldn't call it a
lake, but a pond maybe, and a stream.

53:35.218 --> 53:38.922
Now, promise to spit?

53:38.955 --> 53:41.225
You may need to educate me
on how to spit.

53:48.263 --> 53:49.666
Surprisingly simple.

53:53.870 --> 53:56.373
I've spit
and I won't tell a soul.

53:56.406 --> 53:59.176
Now, tell me everything
about your dog.

53:59.209 --> 54:02.011
Does he love the garden?
Is he trained?

54:02.044 --> 54:04.447
In fact, I've a book
on dog training.

54:04.481 --> 54:07.450
It's on that chair over there.
Fetch it.

54:14.423 --> 54:16.759
When was the last time
you used your chair?

54:17.926 --> 54:19.463
Fetch me my book...

54:19.495 --> 54:21.397
I don't believe your back
is half as bad as you make out.

54:21.430 --> 54:22.932
And I know
you didn't kill your mother.

54:22.966 --> 54:24.702
So who is the bigger liar?

54:27.504 --> 54:29.373
Did you ask after me?

54:32.408 --> 54:34.444
I said I'd heard you.

54:35.446 --> 54:38.781
They said you'd lost
both your parents tragically.

54:38.814 --> 54:41.452
They were very clear
you weren't a murderess.

54:55.899 --> 54:57.367
Do you trust me?

54:58.368 --> 55:00.837
I've something to show you.

55:00.870 --> 55:02.506
Why would I trust you?

55:07.010 --> 55:08.477
You'll damage my back.

55:08.510 --> 55:10.179
I wished her death,
and it happened.

55:10.213 --> 55:12.783
I'm absolutely her murderer.
Okay, fine. I believe you.

55:12.816 --> 55:15.484
But if you take me to that
garden, you'll murder me too.

55:15.517 --> 55:18.021
Of course I'm not taking you
into the garden.

55:20.522 --> 55:22.792
There's something
you need to see.

55:24.928 --> 55:27.998
I was three years old
when your mother died,

55:28.031 --> 55:30.067
and you and I
are almost the same age.

55:38.908 --> 55:40.477
Was this
my mother's room?

55:41.910 --> 55:44.914
No. No, take me back!

55:44.948 --> 55:46.250
You should see these.

55:48.084 --> 55:51.254
No, don't be scared.
You'll like them.

55:51.287 --> 55:53.457
Your mother. My mother.

55:55.258 --> 55:58.194
She came. Don't you see?

55:58.227 --> 56:01.097
I don't want to see.
To Misselthwaite, to visit your mother.

56:02.531 --> 56:04.934
She wanted to see her
before she died.

56:05.935 --> 56:07.370
And look.

56:07.403 --> 56:09.406
No, I don't want to look!

56:09.439 --> 56:11.008
Can you see?

56:14.577 --> 56:16.847
They're inside
the secret garden.

56:25.053 --> 56:28.524
Don't be afraid. Look.

56:33.528 --> 56:36.165
- And we're there too.
- No!

56:37.533 --> 56:40.103
I've been
to Misselthwaite before.

56:40.135 --> 56:43.105
So we did know of each other.

56:43.138 --> 56:45.107
Isn't that extraordinary?

56:46.008 --> 56:48.145
And do you know
what's even more extraordinary?

56:52.180 --> 56:53.215
You're walking.

56:53.249 --> 56:54.984
How dare you!

56:55.017 --> 56:57.220
This is just jealousy
because my mother loved me.

56:57.252 --> 56:59.488
Well, you don't deserve
a mother's love!

57:17.707 --> 57:19.509
Colin? Are you okay?

57:20.943 --> 57:22.178
Where does it hurt?

57:28.450 --> 57:30.486
You don't even
have a hunchback.

57:32.655 --> 57:34.357
Of course I do.

57:36.258 --> 57:38.327
Your back's just the same
as mine.

57:41.698 --> 57:45.269
I swear on your mother's life,
I can't see it there at all.

58:01.718 --> 58:04.221
Come on, let's get you up.

58:14.464 --> 58:17.100
Careful.
You tell me to be careful?

58:49.064 --> 58:50.265
Have you seen him?

58:51.566 --> 58:53.235
He's better!

58:53.269 --> 58:56.606
He still has a limp,
but the leg takes his weight.

58:56.638 --> 58:58.341
The garden has cured him.

58:58.374 --> 59:00.010
It had some help.

59:00.042 --> 59:03.079
No, Dickon.
This is a magic garden.

59:05.515 --> 59:07.783
What are you doing?
I'm a Yorkshire terrier.

59:07.816 --> 59:09.519
Then I'm
a Yorkshire terrier too.

59:09.551 --> 59:12.187
Ruff!

01:00:01.604 --> 01:00:03.106
Mary!

01:00:08.644 --> 01:00:11.214
The robin's helped us
find a gate.

01:00:18.588 --> 01:00:20.156
It's locked.

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.458
Not for long.

01:00:55.591 --> 01:00:57.660
Who's there?

01:00:57.693 --> 01:00:59.495
It's the girl, isn't it?

01:00:59.528 --> 01:01:01.296
My name's Mary,
and you know it.

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.232
I don't want you here!

01:01:03.265 --> 01:01:05.568
I don't want to see you.
You're cruel!

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.405
We're past this, Colin. You'll scream.
I'll scream. No good will come of it.

01:01:17.213 --> 01:01:19.548
They catch you in here,
they'll have you whipped.

01:01:19.582 --> 01:01:21.850
It's worth the risk.

01:01:21.883 --> 01:01:25.187
You risk being sent to school.
We risk far more.

01:01:27.356 --> 01:01:29.758
Don't worry yourself, Mrs.
Medlock. I'll deal with him.

01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:32.395
Never normally causes bother
at this hour.

01:01:32.428 --> 01:01:35.198
I'll take care of it, Mrs. Medlock.
You continue with your chores.

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:37.767
Such a lot to do.

01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:48.310
Do that and you'll
never see me again.

01:01:50.479 --> 01:01:51.915
It's your decision.

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:55.919
This is Dickon.

01:01:55.952 --> 01:01:57.287
Hello.

01:01:59.988 --> 01:02:01.256
He's handsome.

01:02:01.289 --> 01:02:03.359
And he can whistle.

01:02:05.595 --> 01:02:08.631
When's the next time they'll check on him?
I'll bring him his lunch,

01:02:08.664 --> 01:02:10.899
then come back a little after
4:00 to check he's eaten.

01:02:10.932 --> 01:02:12.501
I'm not going!

01:02:13.836 --> 01:02:15.338
You know what you risk?

01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.206
He'll be back in his room
by 4:00.

01:02:27.783 --> 01:02:29.452
I'm not going!

01:02:29.484 --> 01:02:32.955
When we tried to fix the dog,
he refused us too.

01:02:32.988 --> 01:02:35.457
Take his legs, Dickon.
I'll take the arms.

01:02:40.396 --> 01:02:43.232
Or... we can get you
in the chair,

01:02:43.265 --> 01:02:44.867
get you down safely.

01:02:47.035 --> 01:02:48.804
I promise you
we won't kill you.

01:02:48.838 --> 01:02:50.872
You can't promise
anything of the kind!

01:02:50.906 --> 01:02:52.375
You'll die in this bed,

01:02:52.408 --> 01:02:54.743
and all you'll have seen
is the wallpaper.

01:02:54.776 --> 01:02:56.812
Is that really what you want?

01:03:29.544 --> 01:03:30.914
Where's Dickon?

01:03:32.914 --> 01:03:34.650
You're going too fast.

01:03:37.687 --> 01:03:39.422
You're too fast!

01:03:43.825 --> 01:03:46.361
Stop that!
It's the pollen, I told you.

01:03:46.394 --> 01:03:47.530
Take a breath.

01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:53.736
Still alive?
Yes, but...

01:03:53.769 --> 01:03:55.604
We'll work out what hurts
and what doesn't.

01:03:55.638 --> 01:03:58.775
But you have to try,
just as I do.

01:03:58.807 --> 01:04:00.709
Does that sound fair?

01:04:01.943 --> 01:04:03.012
Good.

01:04:09.952 --> 01:04:13.622
Mary, the wall.
Stop! The wall!

01:04:49.925 --> 01:04:52.562
Dickon, what are those called?

01:04:54.763 --> 01:04:56.365
Hydrangea.

01:04:56.399 --> 01:04:59.068
Hydrangea.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.669
And those?

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.740
- Hypericum.
- Hypericum.

01:05:05.475 --> 01:05:07.643
They sound better
in your accent.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.585
Colin, there's a good friend
I'd like you to meet.

01:05:16.919 --> 01:05:21.124
Hold it out and he'll come.
He's here? The dog?

01:05:21.156 --> 01:05:22.725
Just hold it out.

01:05:22.758 --> 01:05:25.627
He wants to say hello.
I can see.

01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:36.738
- He took it from my hand.
- He did.

01:05:36.772 --> 01:05:39.409
- And now he's licking my hand.
- He does that.

01:05:39.441 --> 01:05:40.809
It tickles.

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.879
He's not diseased?

01:05:44.747 --> 01:05:46.649
Not that we've seen.

01:05:49.118 --> 01:05:50.886
What's his name?

01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:52.588
He was called Jemima.

01:05:54.089 --> 01:05:55.492
Till she knew different.

01:05:56.091 --> 01:06:00.096
Now he's... Dog.

01:06:00.129 --> 01:06:02.698
He needs a better name than that.

01:06:02.731 --> 01:06:04.033
Perhaps we should...

01:06:05.033 --> 01:06:06.568
What's your father called?

01:06:08.236 --> 01:06:12.642
Marcus. Can we not
name him after him?

01:06:12.675 --> 01:06:16.479
We should not name him
after my father either.

01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:21.417
My father was called Hector,
and he was a brave man.

01:06:22.051 --> 01:06:23.787
Was?

01:06:26.754 --> 01:06:28.790
Settled. Hector.

01:06:28.823 --> 01:06:30.859
Mary and Dickon
you know already.

01:06:30.892 --> 01:06:32.994
Well, I'm Colin,
and I'm your new friend.

01:07:14.769 --> 01:07:16.538
Oh!

01:07:33.756 --> 01:07:36.959
You think
you just can sneak about

01:07:36.992 --> 01:07:39.562
and act how you like,
don't you?

01:07:39.595 --> 01:07:42.131
Little savage girl.

01:07:42.164 --> 01:07:44.533
I knew
you were hiding something.

01:07:44.566 --> 01:07:49.304
You and your secret ways
and your... deviance.

01:07:49.338 --> 01:07:52.207
Mrs. Medlock, whatever you think
I've been doing, I promise...

01:07:53.676 --> 01:07:55.044
Thieving.

01:07:56.278 --> 01:07:57.780
That the sort
of barbarous behavior

01:07:57.812 --> 01:07:59.982
you learnt out there,
is it?

01:08:01.617 --> 01:08:03.084
Where did you find them?

01:08:03.118 --> 01:08:05.021
Underneath a floorboard.
Where are you taking me?

01:08:05.053 --> 01:08:06.888
You understand these pearls
mean something to me?

01:08:06.922 --> 01:08:08.190
I'm sorry.
She's been everywhere.

01:08:08.222 --> 01:08:10.158
To the boy too.

01:08:10.191 --> 01:08:12.761
His wheelchair was skew-whiff
when I went in this morning.

01:08:12.794 --> 01:08:15.797
It's this roused my suspicions.
She's found my son too?

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.198
Have we just given her
the full run of the house?

01:08:18.232 --> 01:08:20.669
I warned you
what a young girl could do.

01:08:20.703 --> 01:08:23.939
Was it not explained to you to stay
away from the parts of the house

01:08:23.971 --> 01:08:25.640
that were not yours
to roam in?

01:08:25.673 --> 01:08:27.609
Colin is my friend.

01:08:27.642 --> 01:08:29.645
I just thought that if I
could excite him about life...

01:08:29.676 --> 01:08:32.582
Your excitement could kill him.
Do you think he wants that?

01:08:47.395 --> 01:08:49.298
Oh, what have you done?

01:08:50.131 --> 01:08:51.334
Mrs. Medlock,

01:08:52.368 --> 01:08:55.104
let's look into finding
a school for my niece.

01:08:55.136 --> 01:08:56.673
Please.

01:08:57.971 --> 01:09:00.075
I was trying
to make things better.

01:09:00.109 --> 01:09:03.879
Find somewhere to
educate some civility into her.

01:09:14.656 --> 01:09:16.323
You locked me in!

01:09:16.357 --> 01:09:18.660
If you'll be
needing the lavatory in the night,

01:09:18.694 --> 01:09:21.229
you'll find we've provided you
with a chamber pot.

01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:23.163
It's under the bed.

01:09:23.198 --> 01:09:25.767
Martha will let you out
in the morning.

01:11:21.115 --> 01:11:23.118
Hey! Where are you going, girl?

01:11:26.355 --> 01:11:27.388
Mary!

01:11:27.422 --> 01:11:28.991
Follow me!

01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:39.167
Mary, what's wrong?

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:44.206
There are even more secrets
to this garden!

01:12:17.205 --> 01:12:19.208
So Colin's mother
was dying?

01:12:20.275 --> 01:12:21.577
Yes.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:24.280
And you think
she came here?

01:12:24.312 --> 01:12:28.184
My mother came to be with her in
the last days of Grace's illness,

01:12:28.217 --> 01:12:30.953
knowing that she wanted to die
by this tree.

01:12:32.855 --> 01:12:34.957
After which, Mr. Craven...

01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:37.993
He shut the garden away because
memories of her caused too much pain.

01:12:40.494 --> 01:12:43.498
We don't have long.
They're sending me to school.

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.301
No?

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:49.805
This is Grace's garden,
and it needs to cure her son.

01:13:23.437 --> 01:13:25.874
It's cold.

01:13:27.042 --> 01:13:29.044
It's very, very cold.

01:13:32.213 --> 01:13:34.917
I don't think I can.
Course you can.

01:13:37.919 --> 01:13:40.922
I don't think I can.
We've got you.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.296
I suppose it's not so freezing.

01:13:48.329 --> 01:13:49.397
That's the way.

01:13:56.038 --> 01:13:59.008
I've done it. I've done it!

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.378
Now hold your arms out
and lie back.

01:14:06.147 --> 01:14:09.185
And now...
you're on your own.

01:14:39.381 --> 01:14:42.017
Done. Over there, please.

01:14:44.552 --> 01:14:47.488
What are you
laughing about?

01:14:47.521 --> 01:14:49.658
Just enjoying
your happiness.

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:51.492
We're all happy, aren't we?

01:14:51.525 --> 01:14:53.595
We are pirates.

01:14:53.628 --> 01:14:55.464
We're lords.

01:14:55.497 --> 01:14:59.435
We're conquerors
of this fair and beautiful land.

01:14:59.467 --> 01:15:01.970
This is our garden
and we love it.

01:15:04.105 --> 01:15:06.007
No.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.046
It's not our garden,
and it never can be.

01:15:12.114 --> 01:15:14.150
There's something
I have to show you.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.297
Stop. Stop!

01:15:30.632 --> 01:15:33.102
You know
what happened here, then?

01:15:33.135 --> 01:15:35.604
Why would you
bring me here?

01:15:35.637 --> 01:15:37.373
Because you needed to see it.

01:15:37.405 --> 01:15:40.609
Would you like to see the
place your mother died?

01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:44.245
My mother died in a hospital,
alone and in pain.

01:15:44.279 --> 01:15:46.515
Your mother
found a far better spot.

01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:51.319
Dickon, can you
fetch me some flowers?

01:15:51.787 --> 01:15:53.489
The white ones.

01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:56.624
And then can you take me home?
I don't want to be here.

01:15:56.658 --> 01:15:58.560
You don't understand.

01:15:58.592 --> 01:16:01.662
She died here
because it was beautiful,

01:16:01.695 --> 01:16:04.199
and so she made
this place magical.

01:16:05.266 --> 01:16:07.135
It cured Hector's leg, and I...

01:16:07.168 --> 01:16:10.038
I didn't want to see the dresses
and I don't want to see this.

01:16:10.071 --> 01:16:12.374
Please, take me home.

01:17:20.574 --> 01:17:22.811
Oof! Hello, monkey.

01:17:25.814 --> 01:17:27.682
Is something troubling you?

01:17:29.684 --> 01:17:34.656
Your mother...
is sad at the moment.

01:17:36.857 --> 01:17:41.363
Her sadness
has made her unwell.

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:44.333
It's not her fault.

01:17:51.539 --> 01:17:54.275
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

01:18:00.781 --> 01:18:02.751
Not today!

01:18:02.784 --> 01:18:04.686
Colin, I've found these
letters from my mother to your mother.

01:18:04.718 --> 01:18:05.753
I don't want you today!

01:18:05.787 --> 01:18:07.155
All about you.

01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:08.423
And I don't want
that garden!

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:10.592
You need to hear this.

01:18:10.624 --> 01:18:12.895
They talk about how your father
is focusing all his fears

01:18:12.927 --> 01:18:15.330
about your mother's illness
onto you.

01:18:17.832 --> 01:18:21.270
How he seems set on
protecting you from the world.

01:18:22.837 --> 01:18:24.740
And she's scared...

01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:28.878
of the damage he'll
do to you when she's gone.

01:18:36.751 --> 01:18:38.620
Should you be...

01:18:45.293 --> 01:18:46.795
I need to read those letters.

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:50.466
You walked.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.475
Listen to this.

01:19:01.508 --> 01:19:03.578
"She's bold, slightly dangerous,

01:19:03.611 --> 01:19:05.980
and she has a spirit
that nothing can quench.

01:19:06.013 --> 01:19:08.617
I'd be scared for her
if I wasn't so proud of her."

01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:11.353
Who's bold?
She loved you, Mary.

01:19:12.854 --> 01:19:15.757
She wanted me nowhere near her.
Maybe that's...

01:19:15.789 --> 01:19:18.493
"I'm so pleased Colin
is making you laugh so.

01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:20.528
A whole day
pretending to be a dog.

01:19:20.561 --> 01:19:21.930
What a delight."

01:19:21.962 --> 01:19:23.698
A dog, was it?

01:19:23.731 --> 01:19:25.900
"Archie sounds deeper in love
than I've ever heard a man.

01:19:25.934 --> 01:19:29.404
He's just as besotted
as I am with Mary."

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.676
My father wants me
locked in a room.

01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:37.812
That's the thing, isn't it?

01:19:37.846 --> 01:19:40.649
Loss changes people.

01:19:40.681 --> 01:19:41.916
Even your mother, Mary.

01:19:41.949 --> 01:19:43.551
You don't know my mother.

01:19:43.584 --> 01:19:46.254
But I know
what it means to lose someone.

01:19:49.524 --> 01:19:51.026
Listen to this one, Mary.

01:19:51.059 --> 01:19:54.262
"She did a puppet show for me
the night before last.

01:19:54.296 --> 01:19:56.565
An elaborate affair
that required Ayah

01:19:56.597 --> 01:19:59.033
to make some silk curtains.

01:19:59.066 --> 01:20:01.035
She told this
Indian myth story.

01:20:01.069 --> 01:20:03.339
It was quite mesmerizing."

01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:09.378
I hadn't read that.
She wrote about my plays?

01:20:18.953 --> 01:20:20.888
Maybe he's right.

01:20:20.922 --> 01:20:23.492
Maybe neither of us
knew our parents well.

01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:28.564
No.

01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:32.301
She couldn't have loved me.

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:34.869
These letters say otherwise.

01:20:40.107 --> 01:20:43.012
Mary! Mary?

01:20:43.745 --> 01:20:46.580
We've quite the surprise
for you.

01:20:46.614 --> 01:20:51.020
Just had word today,
and what exciting word it is.

01:20:52.753 --> 01:20:55.656
It is a school that is full
of the right sort of people

01:20:55.690 --> 01:20:58.093
and the right sort
of discipline.

01:20:58.126 --> 01:21:00.395
Now, the car will
take you at 3:30.

01:21:00.427 --> 01:21:03.597
We've already packed what
possessions you have into your trunk.

01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:05.400
Tomorrow?
Hmm.

01:21:05.432 --> 01:21:07.435
I'm not ready.

01:21:07.468 --> 01:21:11.073
Uncle? Please, Uncle!
No, you don't!

01:21:11.105 --> 01:21:12.840
Why do you say
your son has a hump?

01:21:12.873 --> 01:21:15.010
- What are you talking about now?
- Colin.

01:21:15.043 --> 01:21:18.413
Stop with your talking.
Or this will get much worse.

01:21:18.445 --> 01:21:21.449
He thinks he has a hump,
but he doesn't, and I think you know it.

01:21:21.482 --> 01:21:23.351
I'm sorry, sir.

01:21:23.385 --> 01:21:26.754
Do you honestly think Grace
would've wanted this life for you?

01:21:26.788 --> 01:21:28.790
You know nothing of my wife.

01:21:28.823 --> 01:21:33.128
I know she wouldn't just stand outside
his door while he cries at night.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.730
Can't you see
what you're doing to him?

01:21:39.534 --> 01:21:42.404
Colin needs to live,

01:21:42.436 --> 01:21:44.105
and this house
is a prison for you both.

01:21:47.675 --> 01:21:50.979
I'm sorry, sir.
She leaves tomorrow.

01:21:51.012 --> 01:21:52.414
Good.

01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:43.925
I can hide in
the garden and be happy.

01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:46.127
At school? I can't.

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:48.562
We don't want you
to go either.

01:23:48.596 --> 01:23:51.098
He's right. We don't.

01:23:51.132 --> 01:23:55.803
But you can't stay locked up in
the garden forever. Life needs living.

01:23:55.837 --> 01:23:58.507
Yeah, says the boy who's seen none of it.

01:23:58.539 --> 01:24:01.709
Says the girl so determined no
one loves her, she'll make it so.

01:24:01.743 --> 01:24:06.748
They won't like me like you do. I'll go back to being alone.

01:24:11.819 --> 01:24:15.022
That smoke...
is that normal?

01:24:15.056 --> 01:24:17.926
No.
Father? Father!

01:24:18.793 --> 01:24:20.529
Go! Go!

01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:30.704
Mary! Get away!

01:24:30.738 --> 01:24:31.972
Who's inside?

01:24:32.006 --> 01:24:34.042
Mr. Craven.
We don't know where.

01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:35.876
I know where he'll be!

01:24:35.909 --> 01:24:37.811
The brigade
has been called!

01:24:37.845 --> 01:24:39.280
Mary!

01:24:39.314 --> 01:24:41.850
No, girl.

01:24:43.284 --> 01:24:44.986
No!

01:24:45.019 --> 01:24:47.821
Come back, girl!

01:24:47.855 --> 01:24:49.156
Mr. Craven!

01:24:54.662 --> 01:24:57.231
Colin?

01:25:03.704 --> 01:25:06.073
Colin!

01:25:07.307 --> 01:25:09.743
Mr. Craven!

01:25:10.979 --> 01:25:14.281
Where is my son?
Where are you?

01:25:14.315 --> 01:25:15.551
Please...

01:25:17.952 --> 01:25:19.887
Mr. Craven!

01:25:19.921 --> 01:25:22.891
I don't understand.
I knew you'd be here.

01:25:22.923 --> 01:25:26.093
- I'm not going.
- I can't go.

01:25:26.127 --> 01:25:27.963
Mr. Craven,
you need to come with me.

01:25:27.995 --> 01:25:30.131
I will not leave
without my son.

01:25:30.163 --> 01:25:33.167
Your son is not here, sir,
but he is safe and well.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.369
I can't desert him.

01:25:35.403 --> 01:25:37.071
Not again.

01:25:37.105 --> 01:25:38.941
I left your son
not five minutes ago.

01:25:40.874 --> 01:25:44.312
I give you my word
on the soul of Grace Craven.

01:25:59.994 --> 01:26:01.630
Come on!
No.

01:26:04.798 --> 01:26:06.068
I can't lift you.

01:26:07.935 --> 01:26:09.204
I can't.

01:26:09.236 --> 01:26:12.140
Just leave me.
Please.

01:26:12.172 --> 01:26:14.208
Don't.
Please, leave me here.

01:26:14.242 --> 01:26:17.012
He needs you!
Your son needs you!

01:26:19.113 --> 01:26:20.749
I've ruined everything.

01:26:55.783 --> 01:26:57.753
Come on! We're going!

01:27:13.167 --> 01:27:15.404
Mr. Craven, I need your help.

01:27:58.311 --> 01:27:59.780
Mother?

01:28:04.418 --> 01:28:05.887
Mother.

01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:21.736
Please stay.

01:28:23.337 --> 01:28:26.040
I know you can't,
but please stay.

01:28:42.155 --> 01:28:43.891
Mary!

01:28:46.427 --> 01:28:48.463
Mary. Are you all right?

01:28:48.495 --> 01:28:51.966
Him. Take him first.

01:29:39.379 --> 01:29:41.248
Show me...

01:29:43.383 --> 01:29:45.419
Show me my son!

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:06.173
It's beautiful.

01:30:06.207 --> 01:30:07.941
And it's ours.

01:30:07.975 --> 01:30:11.445
It was hers, but now I think
she'd want us to share in it.

01:30:13.146 --> 01:30:14.448
And he's here?

01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:18.386
Where is my son?

01:30:18.953 --> 01:30:21.055
Call for him, sir.

01:30:21.087 --> 01:30:22.389
Colin?

01:30:25.559 --> 01:30:26.628
Colin!

01:30:28.095 --> 01:30:29.297
Father?

01:30:32.967 --> 01:30:34.569
Colin.

01:30:34.601 --> 01:30:36.238
Father, I'm here!

01:30:41.409 --> 01:30:42.644
Colin?

01:30:42.677 --> 01:30:44.112
Father?

01:30:57.557 --> 01:30:59.194
I thought I'd lost you.

01:31:05.298 --> 01:31:06.600
Of all the places.

01:31:14.408 --> 01:31:16.144
No. Wait.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.515
Please.

01:31:29.422 --> 01:31:30.992
One, two...

01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:56.117
But how is this...

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:01.388
Magic.

01:32:04.324 --> 01:32:05.659
Secrets.

01:32:08.061 --> 01:32:09.430
Her.

01:32:12.632 --> 01:32:14.434
Her?

01:32:14.467 --> 01:32:15.502
His mother.

01:32:23.543 --> 01:32:25.680
How is it that we're
taught by our children?

01:32:27.714 --> 01:32:29.217
How is that?

01:32:32.653 --> 01:32:34.222
I'm sorry.

01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:38.559
I'm so sorry.

01:32:38.592 --> 01:32:39.728
Enough of that.

01:32:40.794 --> 01:32:43.664
Now, tell me...

01:32:45.298 --> 01:32:47.002
Do you like our garden?

01:33:21.502 --> 01:33:26.339
We have the large French
windows overlooking the patio...

01:33:26.373 --> 01:33:28.709
<i>There were once three people
who loved each other very much.</i>

01:33:28.742 --> 01:33:30.711
<i>Four.
Are you including Hector?</i>

01:33:30.744 --> 01:33:33.114
<i>Maybe I was including
Hector and not including you.</i>

01:33:33.146 --> 01:33:35.283
<i>Five.
I want to include my father.</i>

01:33:35.315 --> 01:33:37.818
- <i>Martha needs to be included.</i>
- <i>Six. And Martha.</i>

01:33:37.851 --> 01:33:41.788
<i>There were once some people
who lived in an old, deserted house.</i>

01:33:41.821 --> 01:33:43.423
<i>Partially deserted.</i>

01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:45.126
<i>And they
discovered a garden.</i>

01:33:45.159 --> 01:33:46.461
<i>One of the people
discovered a garden</i>

01:33:46.494 --> 01:33:48.496
<i>and they didn't know it
at first</i>

01:33:48.529 --> 01:33:50.765
- <i>but the garden was a magic garden.</i>
- <i>It was.</i>

01:33:50.797 --> 01:33:52.699
<i>Because it was a magic
garden it was going to save them</i>

01:33:52.732 --> 01:33:54.601
<i>as much as they
were going to save it.</i>

01:33:54.635 --> 01:33:56.236
<i>I think you should
talk more about Hector.</i>

01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:57.638
<i>If you don't
both pipe down,</i>

01:33:57.671 --> 01:33:59.373
<i>I shan't tell
the story at all!</i>

01:33:59.405 --> 01:34:00.874
- <i>Sorry, Mary.</i>
- <i>Sorry, Mary.</i>

01:34:00.908 --> 01:34:02.477
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:04.678
<i>Now if you're ready
and silent,</i>

01:34:04.712 --> 01:34:06.513
<i>I shall try again...</i>

01:34:25.865 --> 01:34:27.267
Ohh!
