18:14.929 --> 18:18.166
- Look, I know
this isn't paradise.

18:18.199 --> 18:21.169
But at least in here I can
pretend things are normal.

18:21.202 --> 18:24.939
It's a hell of a lot better
than being out there.

18:24.973 --> 18:27.909
- Not for me it isn't.

18:43.557 --> 18:47.095
(gasps) - Any word
from Wilkins and Roach?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.598
(grunting)
- Sorry.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.701
- He can take it. He's been
known to argue vociferously

18:53.734 --> 18:55.970
about how men have a higher
pain tolerance than women.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.706
- Mm-hmm.
- That's definitely not true.

18:58.739 --> 19:01.075
- See? And that is coming
from a doctor.

19:01.109 --> 19:02.743
So you can admit
that it hurts.

19:02.777 --> 19:05.346
- Doesn't hurt. I love it.

19:10.351 --> 19:13.988
- Isn't there anything
else that we can do?

19:14.022 --> 19:17.992
- In the absence of antibiotics,
we just have to wait and see.

19:18.026 --> 19:21.395
What's with the firepower? You
have a bigger target or what?

19:21.429 --> 19:23.264
- What firepower?

19:23.297 --> 19:25.433
- The fertilizer bombs.

19:25.466 --> 19:28.069
From the smell,
it's either that

19:28.102 --> 19:30.004
or you're raising
livestock in here.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.573
- Fair enough.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.343
Yeah, the plan is to take out
as many buses as we can.

19:35.376 --> 19:36.945
It's the easiest way
to take out multiple strigoi.

19:36.978 --> 19:38.179
- And multiple people.

19:38.212 --> 19:40.915
- There's no guarantee
of safety in this world.

19:40.949 --> 19:42.616
- I understand that, but...

19:42.650 --> 19:44.685
you're pushing your luck
with that shit.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.354
- What luck?

19:46.387 --> 19:50.758
And anyway, what's
the alternative?

19:50.791 --> 19:52.760
Pretend like
everything's normal?

19:52.793 --> 19:55.763
Trust the powers that be
to act in our best interest?

19:55.796 --> 19:58.299
That's how we got
to where we are right now.

19:58.332 --> 19:59.467
Too many people sitting back,

19:59.500 --> 20:02.636
just hoping for the best.

20:02.670 --> 20:05.473
- That I agree with.

20:17.485 --> 20:19.988
- Your cousin pussied out.
We came all the way out here

20:20.021 --> 20:22.123
for nothing.
- Gus!

20:22.156 --> 20:25.026
Gus! Hey.

20:25.059 --> 20:27.661
- I told you we could trust him.

20:27.695 --> 20:29.964
W'sup, cuz? You all right, man?

20:29.998 --> 20:33.134
- Hey. - You good?
- Hey, guys.

20:33.167 --> 20:35.636
- So, what do we do?
What's the move?

20:35.669 --> 20:38.406
- So, that's the way in.
Right there.

20:38.439 --> 20:40.308
- Good. Let's go.

20:40.341 --> 20:43.477
- Hold on. Hold on.

20:43.511 --> 20:46.080
First we gotta take out that
sentinel. I'll take care of it.

20:46.114 --> 20:49.150
You guys lay low, all right?

20:49.183 --> 20:51.619
- Move.

21:14.542 --> 21:17.378
(shrieking)

21:29.757 --> 21:32.593
- Ah, man.

21:43.904 --> 21:46.440
- C'mon! Let's go!
- Okay. This way.

21:48.442 --> 21:50.411
- Two of you,

21:50.444 --> 21:52.413
make sure one of the
trucks is ready to go.

21:52.446 --> 21:54.915
- Okay. Come on!

21:58.586 --> 22:00.554
(chuckling)

22:00.588 --> 22:02.756
- (whoops) That's what
I'm talking about, Raul.

22:02.790 --> 22:04.925
What'd I tell you, man?

22:04.959 --> 22:06.927
- How'd they even grow
this shit without sunlight?

22:06.961 --> 22:08.562
- The Partnership
has grow houses

22:08.596 --> 22:10.064
run with
ultraviolet light.

22:10.098 --> 22:11.399
- That's perfect.
They're using tricks

22:11.432 --> 22:13.167
they got from the drug dealers.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.802
Come on, let's get
this shit out of here.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.370
- Get that side.

22:19.207 --> 22:22.943
I see you looking at it.

22:24.645 --> 22:26.780
There you go.

22:27.648 --> 22:30.418
- Raul?
- Back up! Back up!

22:30.451 --> 22:33.121
- Gus, it's cool! I know him.

22:33.154 --> 22:36.690
What's going on, Eddie?

22:36.724 --> 22:38.692
- Hey, man.

22:38.726 --> 22:40.761
You're not supposed
to be in here.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.363
- Right. Yeah, man.
My mistake.

22:42.396 --> 22:44.198
Look, we're
just gonna get out of here,

22:44.232 --> 22:46.534
okay? I mean,

22:46.567 --> 22:48.602
you and me, we're cool, right?

22:48.636 --> 22:51.272
No one needs to know about this?
- Oh, look, I'm supposed

22:51.305 --> 22:53.441
to be keeping an eye on this
place. I gotta report this.

22:53.474 --> 22:55.343
- Listen.

22:55.376 --> 22:58.212
Eddie. It's Eddie, right?

22:58.246 --> 23:01.949
- Yeah. - Look, there's
gotta be something

23:01.982 --> 23:03.951
or some way
we can work this out.

23:03.984 --> 23:06.054
Right? We have a lot
of things we can offer you.

23:06.087 --> 23:09.957
Food, medicine, liquor?

23:09.990 --> 23:12.460
- No, man, no. I don't need
none of those things.

23:12.493 --> 23:14.462
I need this job.
I've got a family, Raul.

23:14.495 --> 23:16.230
(gunshot)
- Jesus!

23:16.264 --> 23:17.298
- Creem, what're you doing?

23:17.331 --> 23:19.167
- Take it and go!
Move, move, move!

23:19.200 --> 23:21.735
- Damn it!
- Go, go, move!

23:21.769 --> 23:23.104
Round this way! Round the back!

23:28.342 --> 23:30.511
(gunshots)
- Creem, chill!

23:30.544 --> 23:32.946
Creem! Chill, man!

23:44.192 --> 23:46.660
Eddie!

23:46.694 --> 23:49.330
Eddie, come out, bro.

23:49.363 --> 23:51.365
Just come out and talk to us,
man. You're not gonna get hurt.

23:51.399 --> 23:53.867
(alarm blaring)

24:01.375 --> 24:03.311
Creem, we gotta get out
of here. Come on.

24:05.313 --> 24:09.049
- Everybody inside. Let's go.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.018
- Where's Eddie, man?
- I dunno. We lost him. Come on!

24:11.051 --> 24:13.521
- No, but he saw me. He's gonna
report me. I gotta find him.

24:13.554 --> 24:16.190
- Raul. You're coming with us,
all right? Come on!

24:16.224 --> 24:18.659
- Let's go, let's go!

24:26.167 --> 24:29.137
- You got anything good?
- I don't believe it, man.

24:29.170 --> 24:31.372
- That was close.
- This is it. Home sweet home.

24:31.405 --> 24:33.374
You got the kitchen over there,

24:33.407 --> 24:35.576
couches. Cozy, right?

24:35.609 --> 24:37.378
Make yourself comfortable.

24:37.411 --> 24:39.380
- Um,

24:39.413 --> 24:41.549
where's the bathroom at?

24:41.582 --> 24:44.452
- It's right back there
to the left.

24:44.485 --> 24:47.087
The toilet might not be working,
so there's a bucket.

24:52.626 --> 24:54.328
- So, this wasn't
quite a gold mine

24:54.362 --> 24:57.165
like you said
it would be.

24:57.198 --> 25:01.068
Your cousin should have known.
- He had no reason to.

25:01.101 --> 25:03.337
It's on me. I should
have done more recon.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.038
- He can stay here tonight,
but that's it.

25:07.975 --> 25:09.577
- You think I'm
gonna kick him out

25:09.610 --> 25:11.945
after what he
just did for us?

25:11.979 --> 25:13.947
He don't got a job
no more, Creem.

25:13.981 --> 25:15.583
- In case you forgot,
this is a business.

25:15.616 --> 25:17.585
Not some charity
group-home bullshit.

25:17.618 --> 25:19.587
- I'm not doing charity.
Raul's gonna hold it down,

25:19.620 --> 25:21.955
trust me. - You're not getting it, man.
- No, you're not getting it.

25:23.624 --> 25:25.859
Raul's family.

25:25.893 --> 25:28.028
He stays.

25:28.061 --> 25:31.465
You got a problem with that,
you take it up with me.

25:40.007 --> 25:43.577
(scoffing)

25:54.422 --> 25:56.890
- I'll be back.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.499
Hi, Jeremy.

26:05.533 --> 26:08.001
- Oh, hey, Miranda.

26:08.035 --> 26:10.738
- We all set for tomorrow?

26:10.771 --> 26:14.007
- Um, what's happening tomorrow?

26:14.041 --> 26:16.477
- Don't get cute with me.

26:16.510 --> 26:18.346
You're bringing in the jizz
fridge and, when it's empty,

26:18.379 --> 26:20.748
you're going to carry me
back out in it.

26:20.781 --> 26:22.750
- Okay, listen.

26:22.783 --> 26:25.085
I know I said I would do it,

26:25.118 --> 26:28.889
and I want to do it.
I mean, I want to help you...

26:28.922 --> 26:30.891
- Look, they haven't stopped
you once on your way out,

26:30.924 --> 26:33.093
no matter what
you've been carrying.

26:33.126 --> 26:34.895
You just need to get me
back out onto the truck,

26:34.928 --> 26:36.497
and we're home free.

26:36.530 --> 26:38.832
- And once they realize
you're gone?

26:38.866 --> 26:42.503
- They'll never suspect you.

26:42.536 --> 26:44.772
You're loyal.

26:44.805 --> 26:46.807
They trust you.

26:48.809 --> 26:51.011
- Look, I just
can't do it, Miranda.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.747
I'm sorry.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.588
- I knew you'd do this.

27:00.621 --> 27:04.292
I just knew you'd pull the rug
out right from under me

27:04.325 --> 27:06.327
when I finally gave in
and slept with you.

27:09.096 --> 27:11.064
- That didn't happen.

27:11.098 --> 27:14.201
- Oh, but it did.

27:14.234 --> 27:16.537
And if you don't
follow through with this,

27:16.570 --> 27:19.807
I am gonna tell everyone what we
did in the medical storage room.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.875
I think Mr. Desai

27:21.909 --> 27:23.877
will be particularly interested.

27:23.911 --> 27:26.079
He's very
protective of us

27:26.113 --> 27:28.916
B-positive girls.

27:28.949 --> 27:32.320
I wonder what he'll think
when he finds out

27:32.353 --> 27:36.089
you got your...
material into the mix?

27:38.091 --> 27:40.394
- This is bullshit!

27:40.428 --> 27:42.563
- What's going on?
- Krystal never came back

27:42.596 --> 27:44.898
from her doctor's appointment this
morning, and now all of her stuff's gone.

27:44.932 --> 27:47.335
She was only on her
fifth insemination.

27:47.368 --> 27:49.169
Now she's probably dead.

27:49.202 --> 27:52.440
- What are you talking about?
- She must've been relocated.

27:52.473 --> 27:56.176
- Oh, right. To the wonderful
B-positive living facility?

27:56.209 --> 27:57.845
Hey, dummies,

27:57.878 --> 28:00.180
we are here because strigoi
like the taste of our blood

28:00.213 --> 28:02.115
and they want us
to make more of it.

28:02.149 --> 28:05.018
So if we can't breed for them,
then what else are we good for?

28:05.052 --> 28:06.920
- This is not the time
to be talking about this.

28:06.954 --> 28:08.188
- They can get more blood

28:08.221 --> 28:10.257
if they keep us alive.
They'll want to make sure

28:10.290 --> 28:11.425
that we're healthy,
that we're eating...

28:11.459 --> 28:12.660
- If that were true,
then why wouldn't they

28:12.693 --> 28:14.127
just keep us all here?

28:14.161 --> 28:17.431
And why all the goddamn secrecy?
- What's going on here?

28:17.465 --> 28:19.032
- Just the same bullshit.

28:19.066 --> 28:21.268
- All right. You need
to settle down, miss.

28:21.301 --> 28:22.970
- And you need to stop
lying to us, bitch!

28:23.003 --> 28:25.573
(gasping)
(light knock)

28:28.809 --> 28:30.811
- Now you've done it.

28:32.813 --> 28:34.382
- You need to stop this.

28:34.415 --> 28:36.316
- I'm not just some idiot.
- Yeah, I know that.

28:36.350 --> 28:37.818
But they're never gonna tell us
where Krystal

28:37.851 --> 28:39.219
and the others went.
But we both know

28:39.252 --> 28:40.888
it's not a place that
anyone would wanna go.

28:40.921 --> 28:42.523
So it's a good thing
you get to stay here,

28:42.556 --> 28:45.793
right? That is, unless you
keep making scenes like this.

28:45.826 --> 28:47.688
- Sir, I just hate to see
you have to interrupt

28:47.713 --> 28:49.186
your work.
- This is my goddamn work!

28:50.498 --> 28:52.165
If you and your staff
can't handle

28:52.199 --> 28:55.168
these little disturbances,
I'm gonna have to.

28:56.437 --> 28:59.306
- No disturbances here.

28:59.339 --> 29:01.308
Everything's fine.

29:01.341 --> 29:03.143
- Is it?

29:03.176 --> 29:05.479
- Just hunky-dory.

29:05.513 --> 29:07.247
Right, girls?

29:07.280 --> 29:10.651
(approbations)

29:10.684 --> 29:13.153
- Hm. Well, it looks like

29:13.186 --> 29:15.956
one of your patients
has done your job for you.

29:22.362 --> 29:25.032
Miranda, isn't it?

29:34.408 --> 29:37.811
Absolutely. I give you
my word. Okay.

29:42.382 --> 29:44.384
Thank you, Lauren.

29:45.719 --> 29:49.122
(door opens, closes)

29:51.224 --> 29:54.061
Have a seat, Miranda.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.407
I can see you're very
frustrated here.

30:07.441 --> 30:10.143
- Why would anyone be
frustrated?

30:10.177 --> 30:12.212
(chuckling)
- Right.

30:12.245 --> 30:14.214
I get it.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.717
You're an
intelligent woman,

30:16.750 --> 30:20.220
you have skills, and
you find it a bit of an insult

30:20.253 --> 30:22.656
that you're being
asked to be a...

30:22.690 --> 30:25.459
baby vessel, right?

30:25.493 --> 30:27.595
Believe it or not,

30:27.628 --> 30:31.665
I'm very familiar with the
feeling of being undervalued.

30:31.699 --> 30:35.402
I'll always be grateful to
people who saw my potential.

30:35.435 --> 30:38.672
Gave me the opportunity
to excel.

30:38.706 --> 30:42.409
That's what I'm doing with you.

30:42.442 --> 30:45.679
I want you to work
for me, Miranda.

30:45.713 --> 30:48.315
Be my special liaison
between myself and the ward.

30:50.117 --> 30:52.753
I've seen these women.

30:52.786 --> 30:54.922
They respect you.

30:54.955 --> 30:56.924
They will listen to you.

30:56.957 --> 31:00.427
- So you want me to be the
mouthpiece for your bullshit?

31:00.460 --> 31:02.429
- Excuse me?

31:02.462 --> 31:05.799
- You know, the B-positive
living facility

31:05.833 --> 31:09.269
that all the infertile
women disappear to?

31:09.302 --> 31:12.540
- Now, that is a very spacious,
very accommodating place.

31:12.573 --> 31:15.709
Barely a downgrade from
the luxury of this place.

31:15.743 --> 31:19.279
- Sure.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.448
What about the babies?

31:21.481 --> 31:24.217
What's going to happen to
the first one when it's born?

31:26.219 --> 31:28.889
- Let me assure you,

31:28.922 --> 31:32.826
those babies are of unbelievable
value to the Partnership.

31:32.860 --> 31:36.229
They will want for nothing.

31:36.263 --> 31:40.167
- So they can eventually
end up as breeders, like us?

31:42.670 --> 31:45.573
- Okay, I'm a very pragmatic
person, Miranda,

31:45.606 --> 31:47.207
and I'm getting a sense that
you are, too,

31:47.240 --> 31:48.976
so why don't we just
cut all the bullshit, okay?

31:49.009 --> 31:50.811
Just be honest.

31:50.844 --> 31:54.815
So, this whole
post-Illumination

31:54.848 --> 31:57.484
new-world crap, it's not
really my preference.

31:57.517 --> 32:00.087
But, hey, it's the world
we're living in now, right?

32:00.120 --> 32:02.322
Now, does that mean
I don't understand

32:02.355 --> 32:04.658
why some people might be
resisting it? No,

32:04.692 --> 32:06.860
of course not.
I'm not an idiot.

32:06.894 --> 32:09.362
But these people,
they're delusional.

32:11.699 --> 32:14.267
And, quite frankly,

32:14.301 --> 32:16.303
they're selfish.

32:18.305 --> 32:20.373
- You think people trying to
resist this nightmare are selfish?

32:20.407 --> 32:22.610
- Yeah, I do, actually.

32:22.643 --> 32:24.945
They're putting
their own

32:24.978 --> 32:28.348
misguided sense of righteousness above
the well-being of all of humanity.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.951
If, instead, they would
follow, I don't know,

32:30.984 --> 32:34.588
my example, maybe put all that energy
into actually helping one another,

32:34.622 --> 32:37.357
then it wouldn't be such
a nightmare, would it?

32:37.390 --> 32:39.727
No, it, uh...

32:39.760 --> 32:42.062
it actually would be
pretty great,

32:42.095 --> 32:44.632
right?

32:44.665 --> 32:48.468
So, what do you say?

32:48.501 --> 32:51.772
You gonna help me, Miranda?

32:54.141 --> 32:56.977
- No. Thank you.

32:57.010 --> 33:00.480
Guess I'm not as
civic-minded as you are.

33:00.513 --> 33:03.183
Quite the misanthrope, actually.

33:05.185 --> 33:09.156
(laughing)
- Misanthrope?

33:09.189 --> 33:11.759
All right. I guess
that's your call.

33:13.761 --> 33:16.263
Well, I hope you end up on the
right side of things, Miranda.

33:16.296 --> 33:18.398
Because the
sad thing is,

33:18.431 --> 33:20.868
these delusional people?

33:22.870 --> 33:26.006
They don't exactly thrive

33:26.039 --> 33:29.176
in the new world.

33:29.209 --> 33:32.112
Anyways, you know
where to find me.

33:39.386 --> 33:42.422
- Still no fever. I think
you're out of the danger zone.

33:42.455 --> 33:46.026
Just keep him clean, let him get
some rest, he should be fine.

33:46.059 --> 33:49.797
- Thank you. I don't know what
we would have done. - Thank you.

33:49.830 --> 33:52.966
- So, uh,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.002
food and supplies?

34:02.175 --> 34:04.477
- Help yourself.

34:08.982 --> 34:12.052
So, is this really the only
reason you came with us?

34:12.085 --> 34:14.788
- What other reason
would there be?

34:14.822 --> 34:18.658
- I don't know.

34:18.692 --> 34:21.795
It just seems like maybe you're more...
(banging on door)

34:21.829 --> 34:25.232
- It's Roach! Alex! - Roach! Roach!
What happened? Are you okay?

34:27.600 --> 34:30.137
- Right after the bomb went off,
we got attacked by strigoi.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.239
I had to hide out by the river
until I was sure

34:32.272 --> 34:33.841
I wasn't being followed.
- Where's Wilkins?

34:33.874 --> 34:35.675
- He didn't make it.

34:35.709 --> 34:37.978
- They captured him?
- No, that's the crazy thing,

34:38.011 --> 34:40.480
they just drained him.
It's weird, right?

34:40.513 --> 34:42.349
I didn't think they were
doing that anymore.

34:42.382 --> 34:45.152
- They only do that
when there's a purpose.

34:45.185 --> 34:49.489
After they've turned him, they'll
have access to all of his memories,

34:49.522 --> 34:53.093
every piece of information
he had. He'll be a part

34:53.126 --> 34:55.395
of their collective
consciousness.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.664
They drank him to get
to the rest of you.

34:57.697 --> 34:59.933
You need to go. They could be
on their way here

34:59.967 --> 35:02.870
right now.
- You heard him. Let's pack up. Fast.

35:04.704 --> 35:07.674
- Where are you headed?
- It's fine. We have other hiding spots.

35:07.707 --> 35:09.709
- And did this Wilkins
know about them?

35:09.743 --> 35:11.945
- Shit. If he knew about them,

35:11.979 --> 35:14.214
they're all blown.

35:16.216 --> 35:18.718
- I've got a place you can go.
But we need to go now.

35:22.155 --> 35:25.959
- Guys, come help me get these bombs out.
- No, it's not enough time.

35:25.993 --> 35:28.361
Take the propane.
- But we need them.

35:28.395 --> 35:30.730
- Go.

35:30.764 --> 35:32.732
I'll handle it.

35:32.766 --> 35:35.568
- Right, guys, come on! Let's move it!
- Over there!

35:37.570 --> 35:40.240
- I've got your stuff.

35:43.410 --> 35:46.413
(snarling)

35:48.415 --> 35:52.319
(beeping)

35:52.352 --> 35:56.023
(shrieking)

36:02.129 --> 36:06.266
- Let's get out of here.
- One second.

36:07.634 --> 36:10.871
(snarling)

36:24.351 --> 36:26.519
Okay, we can go now.

36:38.398 --> 36:41.468
(soft sobbing)

36:48.808 --> 36:50.810
- Is everything
all right in there?

36:52.812 --> 36:55.448
- Miranda?
- Yeah.

36:55.482 --> 36:57.918
(toilet flushing)

36:59.920 --> 37:01.889
Hey.

37:01.922 --> 37:04.892
- I'm bleeding.

37:04.925 --> 37:08.128
- Oh, shit.

37:08.161 --> 37:10.497
I'm so sorry.

37:10.530 --> 37:13.000
- This is the second
time for me.

37:13.033 --> 37:16.336
If Desai finds out about this
one I'm gone, just like Krystal.

37:16.369 --> 37:18.972
- It's okay. It's okay.

37:19.006 --> 37:21.174
We just... we should just
think for a minute.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.243
- You need
to help me, Miranda.

37:23.276 --> 37:27.214
My next exam is
in less than a week.

37:39.726 --> 37:42.195
- Okay, follow me. Come on.

37:53.206 --> 37:55.775
Come on. Come on.
- What is this?

37:55.808 --> 37:57.777
I can't take two.

37:57.810 --> 37:59.746
There's barely room for one!
- You're only taking one.

37:59.779 --> 38:01.681
For now.
- Wait, what do you mean "for now"?

38:01.714 --> 38:04.384
- You're taking me next week.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

38:04.417 --> 38:06.386
I'm not doing this twice.

38:06.419 --> 38:09.056
- Yes, you are, or do you want
me to speak to Mr. Desai?

38:10.157 --> 38:12.125
- Oh, you bitch.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.527
- Yeah, I've heard worse.
This is your air tube.

38:14.561 --> 38:17.464
If you hide it here they'll never be
able to see it from the outside. - Okay.

38:17.497 --> 38:19.399
- Remember. The Olympian Club,
West 54th Street.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.534
When I get out, I'm gonna
come find you there.

38:21.568 --> 38:24.404
It's gonna be okay.
- Okay. Look,

38:24.437 --> 38:26.039
if I'm not back outside
in two minutes,

38:26.073 --> 38:27.740
they're gonna come
in here looking for me.

38:30.010 --> 38:33.046
(banging)

38:33.080 --> 38:35.282
- I can't do it! I'm sorry!
I can't breathe in there.

38:35.315 --> 38:37.584
- Hey. Hey, it's okay,
it's okay. Yes, you can.

38:37.617 --> 38:41.088
You just need to stay calm and
breathe slowly, okay? - No, you go.

38:41.121 --> 38:43.723
- I'm not leaving you here while
you're in trouble. - Okay, seriously,

38:43.756 --> 38:47.094
I need to leave!
- This is your last chance!

38:48.028 --> 38:51.965
Go on. Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

38:52.932 --> 38:55.068
Help me!
- Shit.

38:55.102 --> 38:58.571
I can't be here.
I can't be here. I've gotta go!

38:58.605 --> 39:01.074
I've gotta go! - Wait!
- You're not listening to me!

39:01.108 --> 39:03.610
I need...

39:03.643 --> 39:06.779
- I just found two of your patients
in the medical storage room.

39:06.813 --> 39:10.583
- This isn't what
it looks like. It's...

39:10.617 --> 39:12.785
we were just trying...

39:16.623 --> 39:18.191
- Jeremy,

39:18.225 --> 39:20.360
care to explain?

39:20.393 --> 39:22.395
- I didn't touch them.

39:26.133 --> 39:28.135
- Is this true?

39:36.576 --> 39:38.978
Take him away.
- Oh my God!

39:39.012 --> 39:40.547
Oh my God! No! No! No!

39:40.580 --> 39:43.116
She set me up! She set me up!
She was trying to escape!

39:43.150 --> 39:46.119
I didn't do anything!
She blackmailed me!

39:46.153 --> 39:47.987
I didn't do anything!
This is bullshit!

39:48.021 --> 39:50.657
I didn't do anything!
- You ladies better come with me.

39:50.690 --> 39:53.526
Mr. Desai is gonna have
a few questions for you.

39:55.928 --> 39:58.298
Come along.

39:58.331 --> 40:01.834
Let's go.

40:16.049 --> 40:18.585
- Right, when she gets back
you give her this bag.

40:18.618 --> 40:20.653
You've gotta take this one.
We've gotta get 'em up

40:20.687 --> 40:22.655
as fast as possible, okay?

40:22.689 --> 40:24.657
- Yeah.

40:24.691 --> 40:26.659
- You stick somebody up there,
they can see anyone

40:26.693 --> 40:29.196
coming from either direction.
And if you get in trouble,

40:29.229 --> 40:30.363
there's exits everywhere.

40:30.397 --> 40:31.598
- I take it you've
stayed here before?

40:31.631 --> 40:33.166
- Yeah, yeah,
it would have been

40:33.200 --> 40:35.668
perfect, except I didn't have
enough fuel to keep warm.

40:35.702 --> 40:37.770
But, with your supplies,
you should be golden.

40:37.804 --> 40:41.241
All right? Good luck.

40:42.475 --> 40:45.044
- Listen, why don't you
stay with us? Help us?

40:45.078 --> 40:48.081
- I'm good where I am, thank you.
- I don't believe that.

40:48.115 --> 40:50.117
Hey, I've seen you.
You're a fighter.

40:50.150 --> 40:52.185
So why the hell
aren't you fighting?

40:52.219 --> 40:54.187
- Fighting cost me my kid.
- Yeah?

40:54.221 --> 40:58.057
I lost a kid, too.
So did Roach. And Sway,

40:58.091 --> 40:59.837
he lost his whole family.
You think that means

40:59.862 --> 41:01.361
we should all just lie
down and give up?

41:01.394 --> 41:03.396
- It would do about
the same amount of good.

41:03.430 --> 41:06.733
- That's bullshit.
- All right.

41:06.766 --> 41:08.968
Nobody here is gonna
say this to you, so here goes.

41:09.001 --> 41:10.870
You're just provoking them
and getting people

41:10.903 --> 41:13.140
injured and killed.

41:13.173 --> 41:16.209
You're not going to win.

41:16.243 --> 41:18.578
- We just need
to show people

41:18.611 --> 41:22.081
that the strigoi aren't invincible. If
we can inspire just one single person

41:22.115 --> 41:23.547
to put down their stupid Partn--
- Trying to

41:23.572 --> 41:24.884
inspire people? That's
what you're doing?

41:24.917 --> 41:27.220
- Yes! - Then you need to be
smarter. You need to think bigger.

41:27.254 --> 41:29.656
Anybody can plant
a bomb under a bus,

41:29.689 --> 41:32.225
but those big
Partnership buildings?

41:32.259 --> 41:36.396
I saw them pumping tankerfuls
of blood into the pipes.

41:36.429 --> 41:39.432
If you could find a way
to put something poisonous

41:39.466 --> 41:41.168
into that blood,
you could take out

41:41.201 --> 41:43.736
thousands of strigoi and they
wouldn't know what hit them.

41:43.770 --> 41:45.572
You should be doing
things like that,

41:45.605 --> 41:47.907
instead of messing around
with random bombings.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.909
- Okay,

41:49.942 --> 41:52.111
let's do that.

42:37.257 --> 42:39.259
