<i>Your Honor, the State of New York
charges the defendant,</i>

00:16.225 --> 00:20.020
Mariah Stokes Dillard, with the crime
of murder in the first degree.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.313
Twelve counts,

00:21.396 --> 00:24.983
with victims that include her own cousin,
Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.153
Objection!
Again, for the fourth time.

00:28.237 --> 00:32.658
Mr. Donovan, need I remind you,
there are no cameras in this courtroom?

00:32.741 --> 00:33.867
That's hard to believe,

00:33.951 --> 00:37.162
given the way District Attorney Tower
is acting, Your Honor.

00:37.246 --> 00:40.541
I object
to the prosecution's grandstanding

00:40.624 --> 00:44.628
during what should be a simple arraignment
for a first time offender.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.172
I'm not grandstanding, Your Honor.

00:47.256 --> 00:50.342
Ms. Stokes Dillard's hands
are drenched with blood.

00:52.302 --> 00:55.556
Besides her role
in the so-called "Rum Punch Massacre,"

00:55.639 --> 00:58.600
Ms. Stokes Dillard faces
separate federal SEC violations

00:58.684 --> 01:02.604
for financial irregularities for her role
in the Atreus Plastics merger...

01:02.688 --> 01:06.358
Look at her. She's done.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.111
We finally got her.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.154
I mean, look at her squirming.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.741
She's about to slither.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.869
I'd like to remind the court

01:17.953 --> 01:21.582
that Councilwoman Stokes has been
an upstanding member of her community,

01:21.665 --> 01:24.960
and, like yourself, a fellow Delta Sigma...

01:25.043 --> 01:27.296
You!
You murdered my children!

01:27.379 --> 01:28.922
You murderer!

01:30.215 --> 01:31.049
Order!

01:33.969 --> 01:36.972
Order!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.056
Order.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.272
Bail is denied.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.233
Ms. Stokes Dillard's passport
is to be revoked,

01:48.317 --> 01:51.653
and she is to be remanded to Rikers
until a trial date is set.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.615
Your Honor, may I speak?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.326
I can't believe
I'm actually entertaining this,

01:57.409 --> 01:59.202
but proceed.

02:07.711 --> 02:11.131
Your Honor, I am not a flight risk.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.760
I'm not a risk to the people.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.429
I love my people.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.766
Allow me to explain.

02:22.184 --> 02:25.062
There is a storm wall around Harlem.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.857
One that was built, brick by brick,

02:28.940 --> 02:33.111
by my grandfather Samuel Stokes
and my grandmother Mabel.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.448
That wall is eroding.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.993
Global warming has taken its toll.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.999
<i>Y'all denied the science.</i>

02:47.417 --> 02:50.212
The water has gotten hotter.

02:51.213 --> 02:56.009
What should've been a thunderstorm
is now becoming a hurricane.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.762
But no one is prepared.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.681
Nothing has been fortified.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.394
<i>Resources will be overwhelmed.</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:14.861
The rains will come torrential,
and the water will rise too fast.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.739
Get down!

03:19.199 --> 03:21.910
People won't have time to evacuate.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.755
<i>If you release me...</i>

03:34.464 --> 03:39.553
I will fortify that wall around Harlem
before it's too late.

03:39.636 --> 03:43.056
I find your Katrina references offensive.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.476
I have family from Louisiana
who lost everything.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.020
As long as you have been on the bench,

03:49.104 --> 03:52.107
as long as everyone here has been alive,

03:52.899 --> 03:57.571
there has been a Stokes
patching up that wall around Harlem.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.408
You need me out there.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.952
You want me out there.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.373
Because without me, God help Harlem.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.001
God help us all.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.707
<i>Hell has returned to Harlem.</i>

05:36.419 --> 05:37.879
Shit.

05:39.422 --> 05:44.052
<i>Violent crime has increased 75%
since the arraignment</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:49.558
<i>of former councilwoman turned
criminal godmother Mariah Dillard Stokes.</i>

05:49.641 --> 05:55.105
Police and emergency response times
have increased to all-time highs.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.566
- Professor Cobb.
- You can call me Jelani.

05:57.649 --> 06:02.487
Jelani, you teach at Columbia University
and are a longtime resident of Harlem.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.656
What's your take?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.158
I'm shocked, like everybody else.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.954
<i>I've never seen anything quite like this.</i>

06:11.037 --> 06:13.498
<i>There's shootouts on Convent Avenue.</i>

06:13.582 --> 06:17.919
<i>Old ladies in Sunday hats are getting
smacked around on Strivers' Row.</i>

06:18.003 --> 06:20.714
<i>I read your </i> New Yorker <i> profile
on Luke Cage.</i>

06:20.797 --> 06:24.259
<i>You talk about his bulletproof skin
and his forthright swagger.</i>

06:24.342 --> 06:28.680
Damn, bro. "Streets is hot"
takes on a whole new meaning with you.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.182
No doubt.
It's like the Wild Wild West out there.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.434
<i>If the police are overwhelmed,</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:34.853
<i>shouldn't someone like Luke Cage
be more of a factor?</i>

06:34.936 --> 06:36.563
Here we go.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.984
Luke's a good brother.
At his best, he's shelter from the storm.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.445
<i>Stand close? You might not get wet.</i>

06:43.528 --> 06:46.906
<i>But not even Luke Cage
can control the weather.</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:50.243
No one's blaming you, player.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.287
Doesn't feel like it.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.457
I thought things would get better
with Mariah off the streets.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.833
Not worse.

07:06.051 --> 07:06.968
Tilda.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.221
Ah, Detective Knight.

07:12.515 --> 07:16.227
You know, I never had a chance
to thank you for what you did for us.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.854
I was just doing my job.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.316
Are you here on the job now?

07:21.399 --> 07:22.484
Depends.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.155
You, uh, making more tender vittles
for your friend?

07:27.864 --> 07:29.074
What friend?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.831
Bushmaster is not my friend.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.211
I didn't say Bushmaster.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.132
But, now that you mentioned it...

07:46.216 --> 07:49.469
I mean, he didn't heal himself.

07:53.098 --> 07:58.645
And he probably did not slip inside
your mother's club by himself, either.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.317
I think you helped him.

08:06.152 --> 08:10.657
Maybe you're Harlem's Patty Hearst.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.034
Bushmaster tied us up...

08:13.576 --> 08:15.870
burned my family's brownstone
to the ground,

08:15.954 --> 08:17.580
and my mother's response

08:17.664 --> 08:21.501
was to murder an entire restaurant
full of innocent people.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.796
Now, I have to reconcile with the fact
that that is where I come from.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.466
And I wanted to help her, but I can't.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.260
She is evil.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.972
And Detective, all I wanna do
is move on with...

08:34.054 --> 08:36.808
Do you know where Bushmaster is?

08:37.392 --> 08:38.308
No.

08:48.653 --> 08:52.198
Detective, you wanna walk around
and snoop around my shop,

08:52.282 --> 08:54.492
you're gonna need a warrant for that.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.245
I know my rights.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.125
You see, now, right there...

09:03.084 --> 09:07.255
you sounded just like your mama.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.471
Whatever you think you're doing, stop.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.446
She's gone.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.867
But not for long. She's not stupid.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.121
Do you have it? Is it ready now?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.664
It might not work.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.916
It has to.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.460
Ingrid.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.260
His fever is breaking.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.805
Whatever you gave him is working,
but he's weak.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.350
This root will help with his memory.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.354
But he needs therapy, which includes rest
and diluted doses of nightshade,

10:04.437 --> 10:06.356
which you can only find in Nine Mile.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.690
I understand.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.817
Johnny?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.110
Mmm-hmm.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.194
Drink.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.632
Evil won't die on its own.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.676
You know?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.970
It only festers.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.182
Is she dead?

10:42.600 --> 10:43.601
No.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.732
Mariah must burn.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.027
It's the only way.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.533
Hey, John, come. John, come, come.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.910
Come on, man, easy. Easy, now.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.036
Go easy.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.123
Easy.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.336
Harlem's getting carved up
like a birthday cake.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.046
Who sent out the invites?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.507
Well, it wasn't Eric Hong of the Koreans.
He's dead.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.344
The Dominicans never recovered
from losing Arturo Rey.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.554
Ain't them neither.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.431
That leaves the Puerto Ricans
and the Stylers.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.975
And I haven't seen a single Jamaican
since the surge began.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.187
As usual, Carl,
you don't know shit.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.107
Think about it.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.068
Who has history with each other
in East Harlem?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.906
Who has always wanted to expand west?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.700
The Boricuas and the Italians.

11:40.783 --> 11:45.496
Anibal Izqueda is making moves
on real estate and guns, yes,

11:45.580 --> 11:49.375
but only because the Italians
backed them against the Koreans.

11:49.459 --> 11:53.671
<i>And they got the juice downtown
to keep the Yangsi Gonshi out of it.</i>

11:53.755 --> 11:56.424
I can't trust a damn word you're saying.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.426
You're feeding on the chaos.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.554
Now that Mariah's out of the way,
you wanna take over.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.598
I can't...

12:04.307 --> 12:05.683
even if I wanted to.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.394
Whole world knows that I'm a snitch.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.521
I'm out.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.983
But that doesn't mean
I can't help you win.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.612
Help me win? Help me win what?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.574
When I was a kid...

12:22.825 --> 12:26.788
my mother worked the counter
at Cuchifritos on 116th.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.625
Hector's been the manager there forever.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.671
The Fania All Stars
used to come in there and eat

12:34.754 --> 12:37.966
before going across the street
to sign autographs at Casa Latina.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.677
<i>Three punks robbed that place
the other day.</i>

12:47.225 --> 12:49.310
<i>Smacked old Hector across the head.</i>

12:53.856 --> 12:55.984
He died of an aneurysm this morning.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.780
The old rules are being broken.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.161
Everything is changing for the worse.

13:07.245 --> 13:10.665
You started that when you and Tone
shot this place up and killed Pop.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.670
That was Tone. That wasn't me.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.923
You had a gun in your hand.
You're just as guilty.

13:19.007 --> 13:23.136
Rosalie Carbone wants to take over Harlem.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.055
The same way her father did
back in the day

13:26.139 --> 13:29.517
when he tried to push the Stokes
out of Harlem's Paradise.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.104
She's been waiting for an opening
like this, and now she has one.

13:33.187 --> 13:37.775
I don't like you, Carl.
I never have, I never will.

13:38.359 --> 13:42.238
But you are the only person
that can make this right.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.909
Hey, who told you
you could touch the board?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.995
He came back for his birthright.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.664
He will always be a threat
from the shadows.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.625
We just talked about her.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.420
There needs to be a third candidate.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.255
Someone who loves Harlem.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.884
Someone who wants to shake things up.

14:04.635 --> 14:08.973
Someone who wants
to flip the system on its head.

14:10.725 --> 14:11.809
Who's that?

14:20.234 --> 14:25.948
Fastest way to stop the flow
is to put your hand on the faucet.

14:27.450 --> 14:29.452
That's all I'm saying to you.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.792
You're right, Shades.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.836
You are done on the streets.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.464
And you're done here, too.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.095
If you show up again without an invite
and I'm here...

14:51.015 --> 14:52.392
I'll kill you on sight.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.853
You hear me?

14:58.689 --> 14:59.732
See?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.652
You're not polite anymore.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.447
That's how it starts.

15:27.802 --> 15:28.928
Little Italy?

15:29.011 --> 15:31.597
I don't know. Let me ask my man.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.433
You're like Uber for thugs.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.727
If you wanna know anything about anybody,

15:37.687 --> 15:39.397
ask a driver.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.785
Wagwan?

16:36.120 --> 16:40.166
Shit! Shit! Shit!

16:40.249 --> 16:42.293
Rosalie Carbone says, "Goodbye, moolie."

16:42.376 --> 16:44.128
Wop bitch! Do it!

16:44.712 --> 16:45.796
Do it quick!

16:58.559 --> 17:00.645
You don't remember me, do you, May May?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.272
Sunflower?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.776
I go by my given name now, baby.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.528
Kalinda.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.950
Well, you've grown.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.910
Mabel sure would be proud.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.329
It's a shame you in here, though.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.164
Yeah. Yeah, well...

17:21.540 --> 17:23.667
Thanks for keeping my back.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.628
Don't thank me yet, bitch.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.049
Mabel didn't do right by me.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.802
That's my fault?

17:35.346 --> 17:39.433
We'll protect you,
but you're gonna have to pay us.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.478
You know I'm good. I am good for it.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.398
Just one condition.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.403
I wanna carve my name
in that Jamaican bitch

17:50.486 --> 17:52.655
that threw kerosene up in my hair.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.156
Let me hold something.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.628
One of Pete's nasty-ass gals.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.338
Look in my eyes!

18:10.464 --> 18:12.633
I am the head nigga in charge.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.304
I'll pay you 150 large a year.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.390
Twenty tonight, each.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.518
I'll pay your people on the outside.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.689
Ask around about Mariah Stokes.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.192
I'm the real for real.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.777
You with me?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.197
A'ight.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.909
Then clean all this shit up.

18:52.048 --> 18:56.594
Ben...
you need to get here. Right now.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.803
Bring 40.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.557
I don't care if you shove it up your ass.
Just do it.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.233
Nice.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.073
People always want to see
if the myth is true.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.165
I see it's not a myth in your case.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.208
You realize I have more guys.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.337
Doesn't matter. I'll never stop.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.008
I can't speak for Yangsi Gonshi,

20:59.091 --> 21:02.803
but Anibal Izqueda wouldn't have the wit
to pierce Mariah's wall

21:02.887 --> 21:04.096
if you didn't back them up.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.516
Sounds like you're about to tell me
what to do.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.185
You're right.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.645
Stay your ass out of Harlem.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.232
I was born and raised on Pleasant Avenue.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.818
Harlem is my home. I'm not going anywhere.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.661
What...

21:27.745 --> 21:28.913
...part...

21:30.664 --> 21:31.540
...don't...

21:33.209 --> 21:34.877
...you...

21:36.212 --> 21:38.088
...understand?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.972
What are you gonna do if I don't leave?

21:48.891 --> 21:50.226
You gonna kill me?

21:55.064 --> 21:56.440
So smooth.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.986
You could kill me.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.698
That would be easy for you.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.371
But my Russian friends from Brighton Beach
would have no qualms

22:10.454 --> 22:13.958
shooting up school yards
and taking out whole families,

22:14.041 --> 22:16.168
Moscow style, if you did that.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.671
We make too much money together.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.136
I will destroy your trucks.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.682
I will raid every single warehouse.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.560
I will disrupt the profits
of your partners so much

22:32.643 --> 22:35.104
that they will hand you over to the feds.

22:35.187 --> 22:39.608
I will make your life a living hell.

22:42.778 --> 22:43.779
Or?

22:51.287 --> 22:52.830
Tell everyone to back off.

22:55.082 --> 22:58.836
No action above 114th or below 150th.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.506
From Harlem River Drive
to the West Side Highway.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.384
Retribution on anyone who acts a fool

23:05.467 --> 23:09.722
on Lenox Avenue, Strivers' Row,
Rucker Park...

23:10.931 --> 23:12.683
or any of the parks.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.686
A lockbox around Harlem.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.401
How much would it cost to get a key made?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.403
I can't be bought.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.323
You can't answer that truthfully yet,
sweetheart.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.284
You don't know your price yet.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.041
Mr. Cage.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.214
Next time, let's do this over coffee.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.801
You ever been to Caffe Reggio?

23:49.345 --> 23:51.096
I don't like espresso.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.891
No one's made you a proper cup.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.288
Is Anansi's body in there?

24:17.206 --> 24:19.833
The coffin's already on the ship,
waiting for them.

24:19.917 --> 24:20.793
In Delaware.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.505
New York feels too hot.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.689
Johnny finally got to top of the hill.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.526
Now, he can't even enjoy the view.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.949
It always seems like it's worth it,
but it's not.

24:58.956 --> 25:01.583
I'm glad I didn't kill you, you know.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.544
You're a good woman.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.173
If I can give him
just a little bit of peace,

25:08.257 --> 25:09.967
I will have done something.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.971
The things that the Stokes did to him
can't ever be repaid.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.683
But I am no longer paying
for my mother's sins.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.060
Not anymore.

25:27.192 --> 25:28.527
Can we be candid in here?

25:28.610 --> 25:31.655
Yes. It's the attorney-client room.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.366
It would be illegal
for anyone to listen in,

25:34.450 --> 25:37.411
and anything that they heard
would be inadmissible.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.789
Besides, I bought the head CO a Porsche.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.126
The monitors are off.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.171
Did you bring the money?

25:47.254 --> 25:48.672
I gave it to their people.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.759
They'll put it on their books.
Nothing will trace to you.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.970
What about the snitch?

25:56.221 --> 25:57.473
He's untouchable.

25:58.474 --> 26:02.728
Even if we eliminated our problem,
he's already gone on the record.

26:02.811 --> 26:03.937
There's physical evidence,

26:04.021 --> 26:07.566
and his death would force them
to corroborate other things.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.859
Maybe not.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.278
What do you mean?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.656
There's still a jury to contend with.

26:16.200 --> 26:22.706
A jury might buy
how a rich but lonely widow

26:23.540 --> 26:30.422
could be seduced by an aggressive,
emotionally manipulative man

26:30.506 --> 26:34.468
who uses sex and physical intimidation

26:34.551 --> 26:38.430
to inveigle an otherwise upstanding woman
into a life of crime.

26:39.890 --> 26:40.974
True.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.728
He has numerous murders
that he's admitted to.

26:45.938 --> 26:49.191
Even the gun that was used
on poor Candace Miller

26:49.274 --> 26:51.443
<i>was a family heirloom that he stole.</i>

26:51.527 --> 26:54.029
- Without my permission.
- Exactly.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.156
He also, by his own admission,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.116
<i>tampered with Cornell's crime scene.</i>

26:58.200 --> 26:59.618
<i>- Correct?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

27:00.285 --> 27:04.790
So... in a court of law,
it's reasonable to assume...

27:04.873 --> 27:07.543
There's reasonable doubt
about my guilt in any of this.

27:10.087 --> 27:12.589
Mr. Alvarez is no Sammy the Bull.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.218
More like Shades the Bullshitter.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.055
Revoke his pass.

27:21.265 --> 27:25.269
It's dangerous. It's risky.
But it's worth it.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.272
Anybody else roll?

27:28.355 --> 27:29.273
No.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.069
Can't give them the chance to.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.325
Everyone?

27:42.327 --> 27:43.328
Everyone...

27:44.830 --> 27:46.748
who is not protected by blood...

27:49.126 --> 27:50.919
or attorney-client privilege.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.630
I appreciate that.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.424
I thought you would.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.552
And Sugar.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.262
Why Sugar?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.974
His wife gave me clothes.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.478
I'll never forget that.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.794
Mercedes.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.715
Mercedes.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.304
Victims six and seven tonight.

28:43.764 --> 28:47.643
These two were identified by Shades
as part of the Rum Punch Massacre.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.395
And the others were gonna be
named in an indictment

28:50.479 --> 28:52.272
that was going out tonight.

28:52.356 --> 28:54.650
Mariah is cleaning house.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.235
Calling Mr. Alvarez?

28:57.819 --> 28:59.363
Straight to voice mail.

29:00.489 --> 29:05.577
- You don't think it's him doing this?
- No. I'm worried he's already dead.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.583
Hey! Hey!
How the hell did you get in here?

29:11.667 --> 29:13.168
You need to help me.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.255
Tell your mother I'd never rat.
I'd never roll over.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.173
What's going on?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.301
Just about anybody that's ever worked
at Harlem's Paradise is dead.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.470
Damn it, Alex!

29:23.553 --> 29:25.931
You knew who she was better than anyone.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.808
You should've walked
when you had the chance.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.017
I wanted to.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.521
I just couldn't. She...

29:32.604 --> 29:35.274
She has a way.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.984
But she does love you.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.070
I know that much.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.200
I can't help you.

29:48.787 --> 29:52.374
Please, leave. Before I call the police.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.335
Look, she's dangerous.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.755
Even if she doesn't mean to be.

29:58.839 --> 30:01.967
She can't help it. She's a Stokes.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.220
Huh.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.952
You meditating?

30:30.662 --> 30:31.913
Not my style.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.750
My phone has been blowing up.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.754
Everyone I know that's ever worked for her
is now gone.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.089
Dead people can't testify.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.551
I gotta see Mariah.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.180
Before she reopens the hole in the wall
I just patched up.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.099
I agree. You've got no other choice.

30:53.477 --> 30:56.563
- She coming at your people?
- No. And she won't.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.985
I don't know why, but I like you, Sugar.

31:05.155 --> 31:07.032
Why did you ever start
working for the Stokes?

31:07.115 --> 31:10.786
I came up in St. Nick Projects,
three doors down from Teddy Riley.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.787
Word?

31:11.870 --> 31:13.455
I couldn't sing,

31:13.538 --> 31:15.624
but I could knock the snot
out of a quarterback.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.710
Every school came to see me.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.463
Girls screaming my name...

31:22.422 --> 31:23.799
That's why they call me Sugar.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.134
I was the man...

31:27.511 --> 31:29.012
till I twisted my knee.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.057
That was my shot.

31:32.641 --> 31:33.975
I thought I was done.

31:35.352 --> 31:38.980
Then this councilwoman, Mariah Dillard,
paid for my tuition at Grambling,

31:39.064 --> 31:40.816
even though I couldn't play.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.735
And even after I dropped out,

31:43.819 --> 31:46.822
Cottonmouth gave me a job
and kept food on my table.

31:48.782 --> 31:49.991
How could I say no to that?

31:52.869 --> 31:54.413
That's the thing about power.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.833
People don't care how you get it.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.626
It's all about how you use it.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.503
Right.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.883
Just trying to wrap my head
around this thing, that's all.

32:08.093 --> 32:12.889
I'm trying to broker a peace,
if there is such a thing.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.936
Ain't no different
than being a diplomat, right?

32:18.019 --> 32:20.480
Kick-ass Kissinger. I'm with it.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.233
Believe it or not...

32:24.234 --> 32:26.278
Mariah really does love Harlem.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.739
So do I.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.911
So do I.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.302
Give me your phone.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.386
Now!

33:03.273 --> 33:04.357
Nice try.

33:06.026 --> 33:10.030
Put me on the list under a different name,
and I speak to her alone.

33:10.113 --> 33:14.618
My baby! No!
My Alex! Please, no!

33:14.701 --> 33:16.578
Why?

33:16.661 --> 33:17.787
Alex!

33:17.871 --> 33:22.876
Let go of me! No! Alex!

33:41.311 --> 33:43.313
There's nothing you can do to me.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.360
But there is so much...

33:51.112 --> 33:53.114
that I can do to you.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.744
I ain't gonna front.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.542
I was hurt when you snitched.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.757
Did you ever love me?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.303
I still love you.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.351
Harder than Che?

34:26.313 --> 34:27.399
See?

34:28.775 --> 34:30.985
That's what you never understood.

34:33.280 --> 34:38.702
When you're away at college,
this feels real.

34:38.784 --> 34:41.746
But when you graduate, it's different.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.500
I was committed to you.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.210
Everything.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.797
He would've figured that out eventually.

34:52.882 --> 34:57.012
Me and you could've ruled Harlem together.
Forever.

34:57.094 --> 34:57.929
Mmm, don't.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.890
No. No, 'cause you need to hear this.

35:00.974 --> 35:03.435
You talked to me about the light.

35:04.853 --> 35:08.398
About being Hernan
and putting Shades away.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.652
But you were the one who sold your soul.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.946
And for what?

35:16.489 --> 35:19.326
The legacy of some...
some last name that you hate?

35:21.036 --> 35:25.040
All you had to do was give me the club,
like I asked you.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.375
Or sell that... that goddamn painting.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.211
And none of this would have happened.

35:30.295 --> 35:34.007
We would have been out there,
doing our thing.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.096
I really am done with all this shit,
and I have you to thank for that.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.265
Don't leave.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.479
I already had to off somebody in here.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.899
I'm gonna have to do it again.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.363
Let me give you some advice.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.908
Gangster to gangster.

36:01.534 --> 36:03.203
This is your life now.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.665
Your head on a swivel.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.668
No one you can ever trust.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.714
Don't worry.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.300
You're a natural.

36:20.387 --> 36:23.056
Hernan.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.730
Bye, baby.

37:03.805 --> 37:07.016
Tilda just called. She's ready to see you.

37:09.394 --> 37:13.273
Fine.
Let's get it over with.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.962
Damn. I thought she liked that kid.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.257
Mariah has no like in her.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.051
Have you seen Sugar?

37:42.886 --> 37:43.887
Nah.

37:46.681 --> 37:47.766
I need to see her.

37:48.433 --> 37:49.851
What for?

37:49.934 --> 37:50.852
Closure.

37:52.479 --> 37:53.772
Look, can you get me on the list?

37:53.855 --> 37:55.815
And jeopardize my case? Hell, no.

37:55.899 --> 37:59.694
Look, that bitch is in jail,
and she is still murdering people.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.279
Even if I can't prove it.

38:01.362 --> 38:04.115
All the more reason for somebody
to talk some sense into her.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.452
What? You don't trust me?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.829
Oh, I trust you implicitly,

38:09.913 --> 38:13.374
but you're not the right person
for this, Luke. I'm sorry.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.460
Understood.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.812
Foggy. Cockroach's lawyer...

38:34.813 --> 38:39.025
I need a number. A cell number.
Not the office.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.931
It's good to see you.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.854
I said some harsh things
the last time we talked.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.564
You think?

39:19.899 --> 39:21.568
Have you ever been raped?

39:23.903 --> 39:27.615
When you're raped,
there's a part of you that just dies.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.076
It's the only way to cope.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.498
But then you're left with a piece of you
that doesn't feel.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.083
Can't feel.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.713
I know I'm supposed to love you.

39:43.256 --> 39:46.009
I just don't know how.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.803
I don't know how to say it.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.515
Try saying nothing... at all.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.603
You're just evil.

39:57.979 --> 39:58.980
No.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.482
I'm necessary.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.234
Necessary?

40:04.235 --> 40:06.571
All those people dead. Necessary?

40:07.447 --> 40:10.742
Even Alex? For what?

40:11.409 --> 40:12.285
Hmm?

40:12.368 --> 40:14.203
You think that's gonna work?

40:15.455 --> 40:17.457
Do you...

40:17.540 --> 40:19.876
Do you really think
that you're gonna get out of here?

40:20.460 --> 40:25.632
If there is a single person
from Harlem on my jury, I walk.

40:26.674 --> 40:30.428
Because there will be no one
to contradict what they see.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.806
That's the thing
about black excellence, baby.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.643
It shields you.

40:37.518 --> 40:43.232
And when I get out, you and I,
we will start over again from scratch.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.486
Now, you need to forgive me.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.323
My time here already, I...

40:50.406 --> 40:54.410
I have changed in ways
that I never anticipated.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.329
Your life is a waste.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.041
Every person who's ever loved you,
who you didn't kill,

41:01.292 --> 41:02.543
you pushed away.

41:03.503 --> 41:05.880
Even your precious Harlem.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.677
I almost feel sorry for you.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.387
I pushed you away.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.513
Hmm.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.390
Just like Mama Mabel did me.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.393
And you're better for it.

41:18.977 --> 41:24.273
No one will ever hurt you,
because you'll never be hurt worse.

41:25.566 --> 41:26.985
And that's a blessing?

41:27.068 --> 41:28.778
You're prepared.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.366
Nobody will ever betray you,
'cause you'll never let 'em close enough.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.452
You're welcome.

41:37.537 --> 41:41.499
Look, I need you
to look in on the Paradise for me.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.335
And why the hell would I do that?

41:44.419 --> 41:47.463
Because it's home.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.803
The music lives inside of you, Tilda.

41:53.886 --> 41:59.642
Whether or not you surrender to the rhythm
is up to you.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.938
But before you walk away from it,

42:04.022 --> 42:07.817
from me, from our legacy...

42:09.402 --> 42:11.446
You stand inside of it.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.741
You tell me I'm wrong.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.413
Hey...

42:22.290 --> 42:26.377
I no longer see Pete's face
when I look at you.

42:29.630 --> 42:30.965
I see mine.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.310
Oh, sweetie.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.443
I love you, Mother.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.284
I hope you find peace.

42:59.660 --> 43:01.621
Even though you don't deserve it.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.975
You're never gonna guess
who just called me.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.897
She called me "Mother."

43:29.107 --> 43:30.733
Not "Mommy."

43:40.701 --> 43:43.579
Tilda didn't mean a damn thing she said.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.048
I need you to do something.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.718
And it needs to be official.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.933
Who? Who called?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.340
This is highly unusual...

47:23.424 --> 47:25.092
and admittedly awkward.

47:26.677 --> 47:27.678
So leave.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.106
This is a first.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.694
You want to see me, and I want to see you.

47:49.742 --> 47:51.494
I met with Rosalie Carbone.

47:51.577 --> 47:52.661
I heard.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.956
I repaired the wall.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.542
There's a new gangster in town.

48:00.711 --> 48:01.962
I prefer "sheriff."

48:03.714 --> 48:05.424
"Diplomat," maybe.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.593
How about "warden," jailbird?

48:07.676 --> 48:11.263
Hey, you're the one wearing the jumpsuit.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.061
Look...

48:18.479 --> 48:20.022
Shades is done.

48:21.398 --> 48:23.859
The Stylers are done.

48:25.611 --> 48:29.698
Don't undercut the peace that
I have brokered by killing anyone else.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.785
I simply don't have that kind of juice
anymore, babe.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.790
You think too much of me, kid.

48:37.873 --> 48:40.751
I think very little of you.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.922
And soon... not at all.

48:46.882 --> 48:50.094
Everybody else I called here in some way.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.555
But you came on your own.

48:54.515 --> 48:56.392
You really care about me, don't you?

48:56.475 --> 48:59.478
You really are delusional.

48:59.562 --> 49:01.438
You were the catalyst, man.

49:02.898 --> 49:06.986
You made me find who I really am.

49:08.279 --> 49:09.321
In a strange way,

49:10.364 --> 49:12.283
we're responsible for each other.

49:13.367 --> 49:14.994
Bitch, please.

49:16.662 --> 49:18.330
Uh, no offense.

49:18.873 --> 49:20.958
None taken, nigga.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.379
The preacher's son.

49:25.462 --> 49:28.674
Even when you're ugly, you are regal.

49:31.177 --> 49:33.095
Harlem's gonna need a king.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.473
I'm glad it's you.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.145
And I'm glad...

49:42.146 --> 49:45.274
that you're never going to get
out of here.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.528
Everyone has walked away from you.

49:51.155 --> 49:54.617
And I'm gonna be the last one.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.826
Don't be too sure...

50:02.208 --> 50:03.042
Shit.

50:04.126 --> 50:05.044
Mariah?

50:06.545 --> 50:08.422
Tilda! Shit!

50:11.842 --> 50:13.385
Beso de la AraÃ±a.

50:28.525 --> 50:29.568
No one's coming.

50:31.487 --> 50:33.364
You can't save me?

50:33.447 --> 50:34.448
Nah.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.910
I've done all the saving I can do.

50:40.621 --> 50:43.082
But I will keep you company.

50:43.666 --> 50:44.583
Thank you.

50:47.628 --> 50:49.213
It burns.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.758
Good.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.972
We ain't done yet, Luke.

51:32.548 --> 51:34.883
Hernan Alvarez.

51:39.847 --> 51:43.017
You are under arrest
for the murder of Candace Miller

51:43.100 --> 51:45.894
and Darius "Comanche" Jones.

51:45.978 --> 51:48.981
- Bullshit. I have a deal.
- Mmm.

51:49.523 --> 51:54.611
Now, you see, you alienated your lawyer
before she could explain the fine print.

51:54.695 --> 51:55.988
Your proffer

51:56.071 --> 52:01.076
was contingent upon the successful
conviction of Mariah Dillard.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.661
And when she died,

52:03.412 --> 52:04.830
your deal died with her.

52:06.332 --> 52:11.253
Oh. And we also received an anonymous
ledger with your Atreus dealings

52:12.379 --> 52:16.633
and a code that I bet
will match up with gun sales.

52:19.762 --> 52:22.014
She thought of everything, didn't she?

52:23.766 --> 52:26.894
What a crazy bitch.

52:26.977 --> 52:27.978
Yeah.

52:28.812 --> 52:31.315
That's something we finally agree on.

53:01.470 --> 53:03.722
I've known your family
for years.

53:04.390 --> 53:05.682
I've done them all.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.811
Do you want the usual bells and whistles?

53:08.894 --> 53:10.562
Mahogany and gold?

53:10.646 --> 53:12.815
Just cremate her.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.650
I don't care about her ashes.

53:15.484 --> 53:17.403
Uh, as you wish, Ms. Stokes.

53:19.029 --> 53:20.906
The last Stokes just died.

53:22.616 --> 53:23.826
It's Johnson.

53:24.743 --> 53:27.121
Tilda Johnson.

53:37.256 --> 53:39.007
Sorry, May May.

53:50.477 --> 53:52.438
She really died in your arms?

53:54.148 --> 53:55.524
And she thanked me.

53:58.318 --> 54:00.404
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.866
I was around that lady my whole life.

54:04.741 --> 54:06.326
I know she was evil,

54:07.327 --> 54:08.495
but I can't front.

54:09.204 --> 54:10.414
I'm gonna miss her.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.041
Personally...

54:14.084 --> 54:16.712
I haven't felt this weird
since November 9th.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.505
Know what I'm saying?

54:21.842 --> 54:23.677
Easy, bredren.

54:25.679 --> 54:26.972
I heard the news.

54:29.391 --> 54:32.895
Harlem... is in the right hands now.

54:36.273 --> 54:37.608
Walk good, man.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.657
You really are Luke Corleone, aren't you?

54:46.867 --> 54:48.410
It's not like that, D-Dub.

54:51.497 --> 54:53.207
The streets not hot no more.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.834
The dealers left the park.
What did you do?

54:56.710 --> 54:58.170
I had a few conversations.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.547
Uh, put some people on notice.

55:01.298 --> 55:02.800
I made things right.

55:04.927 --> 55:09.306
Wait, wait, the crime faucet
your mans was talking about...

55:09.389 --> 55:12.434
That's why you went to see Mariah
on that Hyman Roth shit.

55:13.936 --> 55:16.730
Look... I'm bulletproof.

55:16.813 --> 55:17.814
Okay?

55:18.774 --> 55:20.025
You can't burn me.

55:20.859 --> 55:22.110
You can't blast me.

55:23.278 --> 55:24.780
And you can't break me.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.865
And most importantly...

55:28.200 --> 55:29.451
you can't buy me.

55:30.202 --> 55:33.664
I'm the only person
that can make Harlem great again, D-Dub.

55:35.874 --> 55:37.334
Luke Trump.

55:38.252 --> 55:41.797
Listen, I'm sorry to say this, man,
but if you're gonna be the boss of crime,

55:41.880 --> 55:43.173
then you're a crime boss.

55:45.634 --> 55:47.344
Ain't no two other ways about it.

55:47.427 --> 55:50.055
You and Sug got to bounce.

55:51.515 --> 55:53.183
- What?
- Yeah.

55:53.267 --> 55:56.728
Yeah, you heard me.
'Cause I'mma tell you what I'm finna do.

55:56.812 --> 55:58.605
When Ms. Hopson comes here,

55:58.689 --> 56:02.401
I'm giving her all the money
I made selling this merchandise,

56:02.484 --> 56:05.112
and I'm taking over the lease
of the barbershop.

56:05.195 --> 56:08.115
Because if this is the route
that you're gonna go,

56:08.949 --> 56:12.494
you can come here
and get your hair cut, but that's it.

56:13.996 --> 56:15.664
Can't talk shop around here.

56:16.915 --> 56:20.919
'Cause this place is Switzerland.
It has to be, and you know it.

56:25.882 --> 56:26.883
All right.

56:28.218 --> 56:29.219
All right.

56:31.221 --> 56:32.681
I respect that.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.894
Mr. Cage. We need to talk.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.234
Not here.

56:49.031 --> 56:51.325
- Coming, big man?
- No doubt.

56:58.624 --> 57:00.334
I thought you weren't a king.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.086
I'm not.

57:04.421 --> 57:05.547
I'm a rook.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.342
Luke, wait.

57:10.802 --> 57:12.179
Don't do this, man.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.222
You don't have to do it like this.

57:19.645 --> 57:21.146
Somebody has to.

57:26.109 --> 57:29.446
Ms. Stokes' handwritten will
is as follows.

57:30.197 --> 57:35.911
The Basquiat will be donated
to the Studio Museum of Harlem.

57:35.994 --> 57:37.245
Her leftover millions

57:37.329 --> 57:41.959
will transform the Family First Initiative
into the Family First Foundation.

57:43.669 --> 57:44.586
Tilda...

57:45.879 --> 57:48.423
she left you Cornell's keyboard.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.471
And I quote...

57:55.764 --> 57:57.599
"To Carl Lucas,

57:57.683 --> 58:00.769
known on the streets of Harlem
as Luke Cage,

58:01.728 --> 58:04.147
I give Harlem's Paradise.

58:04.982 --> 58:08.485
The club, the deed, the name."

58:19.830 --> 58:21.164
Why?

58:21.248 --> 58:23.208
Because Tilda just lied to you?

58:23.291 --> 58:24.292
No.

58:26.294 --> 58:29.006
Harlem's Paradise
is the crown jewel of Harlem.

58:30.465 --> 58:36.263
It should go to someone
who loves Harlem as much as I do.

58:40.976 --> 58:43.311
<i>You know the story of the Sirens?</i>

58:45.063 --> 58:46.982
<i>The beauty of their voices</i>

58:47.065 --> 58:51.945
compelled men off course
to crash against the rocks.

59:02.164 --> 59:05.250
<i>This club will be his siren.</i>

59:05.333 --> 59:07.586
He'll be lulled by its song,

59:08.253 --> 59:11.131
lulled by so-called greatness.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.717
She really said that?

59:14.634 --> 59:16.845
"You can't rule no kingdom
from a barbershop,"

59:16.928 --> 59:18.096
is what she said to me.

59:32.486 --> 59:38.075
<i>The preacher's son will think
he can use the roost to change things,</i>

59:39.868 --> 59:41.286
<i>to control it.</i>

59:42.704 --> 59:44.039
<i>But in the end...</i>

59:45.791 --> 59:47.292
it will change him.

59:57.260 --> 59:58.512
Do you want it?

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:08.814
Nah.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:11.441
You should burn it.

01:00:13.485 --> 01:00:15.112
Burn it down to the ground.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:44.576
You know, just because she gave it to you
didn't mean you had to take it.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.914
Everything flows through here, right?

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.000
I can watch from above. Like a hawk.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.586
Or a dictator.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:58.215
This is the right move, Misty, trust me.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:01:59.674
Things are quiet again.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.177
I did that.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:06.139
Not all crime is gone,
but people are thinking twice now.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.934
They know there's a new sheriff in town.

01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:14.356
We can finally protect Harlem again.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:17.525
I'll enforce the unwritten rules
while you enforce the written ones.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.988
And what about the law, Luke?

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:28.578
But when has the law
ever really protected us?

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:35.252
Don't think that I will hesitate
to take you down...

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:37.170
if you start acting a fool.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.507
I'm counting on it.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.474
Rosalie Carbone needs to talk.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.768
Anibal Izqueda is here, too.

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:56.147
What do you want me to do?

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:58.108
Put them in VIP downstairs.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:00.360
Anything else?

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.358
She's here.
What do you want me to tell her?

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.746
Tell Claire to go home.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:20.977
<i>Your strength is from God, Carl.</i>

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.022
<i>I have no doubt in my mind about that.</i>

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:29.360
<i>But with that kind of power
comes its share of pain.</i>

01:06:29.444 --> 01:06:31.237
<i>I know, Dad.</i>

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:35.742
<i>Science? Magic? God?</i>

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.495
<i>That power flows from within.</i>

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:41.039
<i>From inside.</i>

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:44.375
<i>What comes out
when that pressure is heaviest?</i>

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:47.212
<i>That's the real magic.</i>

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:50.715
<i>That's what defines being a man.</i>

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.676
<i>That's what defines being a hero.</i>

01:06:54.305 --> 01:07:00.595
