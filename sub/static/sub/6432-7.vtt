and only a handful of doctors
are prescribing it

08:39.023 --> 08:41.491
in a select few cities.

08:41.558 --> 08:43.293
Did you treat all four
of these patients?

08:43.361 --> 08:45.595
No, only Byck and Tufano.
I don't know the others.

08:45.663 --> 08:48.031
- Can I help you?
- Um, uh--

08:48.099 --> 08:49.566
so this isn't the connection.

08:49.634 --> 08:50.734
Uh, maybe we need to check
the pharmacy

08:50.801 --> 08:52.302
where they got the pills.

08:52.370 --> 08:54.804
No, Byck and Tufano went
to different drugstores.

08:54.872 --> 08:56.973
Can I ask
what you're looking for?

08:57.041 --> 08:58.675
And, uh,
can I be a part of this?

08:58.743 --> 09:00.110
Hi. Me again.

09:00.178 --> 09:01.678
Right.

09:01.746 --> 09:04.548
Uh, look, I know we had
a little thing out there

09:04.615 --> 09:06.183
with the chin,

09:06.250 --> 09:07.384
but this
is official business.

09:07.451 --> 09:09.886
Deb Stanley,
Moorpark Pharmaceutical.

09:09.954 --> 09:11.154
We make Reduxid.

09:11.222 --> 09:12.789
[Intercom beeps]
Dr. Selden,

09:12.857 --> 09:14.691
Mr. Lieber is getting
very impatient.

09:14.759 --> 09:17.727
Mr. Lieber
and his spastic colon.

09:17.795 --> 09:19.763
Excuse me.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.398
We would be very interested
to know if our pill

09:21.465 --> 09:22.699
is making people taller.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.935
It's not just making
people taller.

09:25.002 --> 09:27.070
There are four people
currently in critical condition

09:27.138 --> 09:28.805
- in the ICU.
- I didn't know that.

09:28.873 --> 09:31.274
Okay, if it is the pill,

09:31.342 --> 09:32.542
it can't just be
the pill.

09:32.610 --> 09:34.544
Right? I keep tabs
of all the doctors

09:34.612 --> 09:35.812
that are participating
in the trial,

09:35.880 --> 09:37.414
and whatever's going on,

09:37.481 --> 09:39.216
it's only happening
here in South Bend.

09:39.283 --> 09:40.684
So if the FDA
wants to get involved--

09:40.751 --> 09:43.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not the FDA, okay?

09:43.688 --> 09:45.088
We're the Secret Service.

09:45.156 --> 09:46.856
Does the president
have heartburn?

09:46.924 --> 09:49.759
- Wouldn't you?
- Ms. Stanley,

09:49.827 --> 09:51.161
we're not going
after your company,

09:51.229 --> 09:53.263
and we already know
that this is only happening

09:53.331 --> 09:54.531
in South Bend, so--

09:54.599 --> 09:55.932
We're trying to help
these people.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.701
- Good. Me too.
- Well, uh,

09:57.768 --> 09:59.236
then you can get us a list
of all the patients

09:59.303 --> 10:01.371
who are taking
Reduxid currently

10:01.439 --> 10:02.606
that live in the city.

10:02.673 --> 10:03.840
Do you have a subpoena?

10:03.908 --> 10:05.475
[Snickers]

10:05.543 --> 10:06.710
I know. <i>Subpoena.</i>

10:06.777 --> 10:08.078
It's kind of a funny word,
right?

10:08.145 --> 10:10.480
- It just sounds like--
- Pete.

10:10.548 --> 10:11.815
It's okay. I grew up
with three brothers.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.650
- Ah.
- Penis. It sounds like penis.

10:13.718 --> 10:15.185
Okay.
So...

10:15.253 --> 10:18.054
You guys are looking
for some environmental factor.

10:18.122 --> 10:20.557
Right? Some place that
the affected patients have been

10:20.625 --> 10:22.726
or something
that they've done in common?

10:22.793 --> 10:23.860
Something like that.

10:23.928 --> 10:25.362
Then we work together.

10:25.429 --> 10:26.463
- Oh--
- Kay. Okay.

10:26.530 --> 10:27.497
- But--
- Okay.

10:27.565 --> 10:29.899
Okay. So.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.636
Patient info is all by code
for confidentiality.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.671
Now, I don't have the name
of the patients.

10:34.739 --> 10:35.772
I only have
the doctors' numbers.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.073
But I can call them.

10:37.141 --> 10:38.341
I can ask them to have
the patients talk to us.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.243
We still have to look
into those four victims

10:40.311 --> 10:41.678
that we already know about.

10:41.746 --> 10:42.946
Why don't we split up?

10:43.014 --> 10:44.214
You dig into the four
we know,

10:44.282 --> 10:47.050
and I'll go play doctor
with Deb.

10:49.487 --> 10:50.787
"Brother" Adrian?

10:50.855 --> 10:54.324
As in Brotherhood
of the Black Diamond?

10:54.392 --> 10:55.625
How--how did you--

10:55.693 --> 10:56.626
Well, as soon as we found
the diamonds,

10:56.694 --> 10:58.094
I did some surfing.

10:58.162 --> 10:59.562
They're a secret society
in France.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.632
Yeah, well, s-secret society
doesn't quite capture it.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.602
One of the last offshoots
of the Knights Templar.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.437
So what's their beef
with us?

11:07.505 --> 11:09.039
Not us. Me.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.641
Brother Adrian has a grudge
against me personally.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.009
So that's why he's been
stealing artifacts

11:13.077 --> 11:14.311
that are meaningful to you.

11:14.378 --> 11:15.312
A grudge?
More info, please.

11:15.379 --> 11:16.980
He's trying to force me

11:17.048 --> 11:20.050
to do something
that I...I can't do.

11:20.117 --> 11:21.284
What--what does he--

11:21.352 --> 11:22.786
What that is
I can't tell you.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.187
Suffice it to say
it would be bad,

11:24.255 --> 11:25.689
and that's all you get.

11:25.756 --> 11:28.992
I'm maxed out on my
sharing quota for the day.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.226
Okay, we'll wait outside.

11:30.294 --> 11:34.164
We're just trying
to help you here.

11:34.231 --> 11:37.033
[Sighs]

11:37.101 --> 11:38.501
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

11:38.569 --> 11:41.137
"I'm sorry" and "Thank you"
in the same sentence?

11:41.205 --> 11:42.305
Keep your eye out
for four horsemen.

11:42.373 --> 11:44.074
It turns out
the Mayans were right.

11:44.141 --> 11:45.408
How is this guy
even getting in?

11:45.476 --> 11:46.776
I mean, there've been
no security breaches,

11:46.844 --> 11:49.245
no break-ins,
no unauthorized open doors.

11:49.313 --> 11:51.047
Well, he's using an artifact,
isn't he?

11:51.115 --> 11:52.816
One would assume.

11:52.883 --> 11:54.584
So do you have any idea
how to find him?

11:54.652 --> 11:55.552
Uh, yeah, I've got
a number,

11:55.619 --> 11:57.020
but I've tried tracing it.

11:57.088 --> 11:58.855
It's routed through
all these anonymous handoffs.

11:58.923 --> 12:00.690
- It's impossible.
- [Laughs] Oh, Artie.

12:00.758 --> 12:03.259
You are adorable.
This is why you ask for help.

12:03.327 --> 12:04.794
The number, please.

12:08.032 --> 12:11.768
Anyone you tell
will be in grave danger.

12:11.836 --> 12:15.839
[Cell phone ringing]

12:15.906 --> 12:17.006
Oh, Secret Service stuff.

12:17.074 --> 12:19.676
- Ah.
- Hey, Mykes. Anything?

12:19.744 --> 12:22.011
No, there's no connection
between any of the victims yet.

12:22.079 --> 12:23.513
What about you?

12:23.581 --> 12:26.783
How goes it with the, uh,
second ex-future-Mrs. Lattimer?

12:26.851 --> 12:30.053
Not bad, not bad.

12:30.121 --> 12:33.656
She's not half the hard-ass
we made her out to be at first.

12:33.724 --> 12:35.091
Hey, Mykes, uh,

12:35.159 --> 12:37.260
we just hit the last
of the docs on the list,

12:37.328 --> 12:39.662
and none of the other patients
are getting any taller.

12:39.730 --> 12:41.831
So it is limited
to a small group.

12:41.899 --> 12:42.932
Okay, you know what?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.200
I'm gonna go back
to the hospital

12:44.268 --> 12:45.468
and see if any of the victims
can talk.

12:45.536 --> 12:46.536
You stick with Deb.

12:46.604 --> 12:47.704
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.072
I mean, there's still
some connection

12:49.140 --> 12:51.441
involving Reduxid
that we haven't figured out,

12:51.509 --> 12:54.077
so, you know,
work your boyish charm.

12:54.145 --> 12:55.311
Investigate.

12:55.379 --> 12:57.180
All right, well,
twist my arm.

12:57.248 --> 12:58.748
You tell the President
I'll call him back

12:58.816 --> 13:00.283
when I'm good and ready.

13:00.351 --> 13:01.351
[Phone beeps]
Sorry.

13:01.419 --> 13:02.719
Yeah.

13:02.787 --> 13:04.754
So, Deb,
I gotta tell you,

13:04.822 --> 13:07.257
you were, uh, pretty good
with the docs in there.

13:07.324 --> 13:10.226
Wow. Sound more surprised.

13:10.294 --> 13:11.494
It is what I do.

13:11.562 --> 13:12.629
[Chuckles]
No, I know.

13:12.696 --> 13:14.330
It's just, uh,
you know,

13:14.398 --> 13:16.266
when we first met, I--
I don't know.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.934
I thought you were gonna be
a little more--

13:18.002 --> 13:19.903
Hard-ass?

13:19.970 --> 13:21.471
I meant it
in the best possible way.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.674
As in, "wow, hard ass."

13:24.742 --> 13:27.944
It's not exactly the compliment
a girl's looking for.

13:28.012 --> 13:29.245
You can bounce a quarter
off of mine.

13:29.313 --> 13:30.880
I do not want to know
how you know that.

13:30.948 --> 13:32.682
- [Laughs]
- Anyway,

13:32.750 --> 13:34.584
as it happens,
I like doctors.

13:34.618 --> 13:36.619
My dad was one.
He's gone now.

13:36.687 --> 13:38.154
Oh, mine too.

13:38.222 --> 13:40.657
Uh, dead, not a doctor.

13:40.724 --> 13:43.426
Also, sorry.

13:43.494 --> 13:46.996
So why didn't you follow
in his footsteps?

13:47.064 --> 13:48.231
Did you ever notice
how most doctors

13:48.299 --> 13:49.999
already seem
to know everything?

13:50.067 --> 13:51.868
What, you don't find that
attractive?

13:51.936 --> 13:54.237
Oh, no, no, no.
You're hiding that very well.

13:54.305 --> 13:56.406
Ah, see, there's that
hard-ass thing again.

13:56.474 --> 14:01.711
Point is, I prefer working
in new drug development.

14:01.779 --> 14:05.348
And I like being in a field
that's still discovering.

14:05.416 --> 14:09.185
I mean, the world's full
of surprises, right?

14:15.693 --> 14:17.393
[Loud knock at door]

14:17.461 --> 14:19.929
- [Inhales sharply]
- What time is it?

14:19.997 --> 14:21.931
A little after 4:00.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.032
- Pete, it's me.
- [Gasps]

14:23.100 --> 14:24.767
- Hurry!
- Pete!

14:24.835 --> 14:27.370
[Huffing and puffing]

14:27.438 --> 14:31.007
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:31.075 --> 14:35.178
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:35.246 --> 14:36.446
[Loud knocking]
Ooh! Dress! Okay.

14:36.514 --> 14:37.580
Open the door.

14:37.648 --> 14:39.249
- Oh, hey, Myka.
- Hey.

14:39.316 --> 14:41.351
Yeah, I'm sleeping, and--
and--okay.

14:41.418 --> 14:43.319
Get dressed, okay?

14:43.387 --> 14:44.954
Leena picked up a 9-1-1 call
from a new victim,

14:45.022 --> 14:46.556
and Artie sent us this,

14:46.624 --> 14:50.093
the gold spike that completed
the transcontinental railroad.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.861
It pulls things together.
He thinks it might...

14:51.929 --> 14:55.265
slow... the symptoms...

14:55.332 --> 14:56.766
You slept with her,
didn't you?

14:56.834 --> 14:59.536
Well, you--you told me
to investigate, okay?

14:59.603 --> 15:01.704
So...

15:01.772 --> 15:03.406
She's unarmed.

15:03.474 --> 15:04.841
You know what?
Just get dressed, okay?

15:04.909 --> 15:06.676
Just--oh!

15:06.744 --> 15:07.710
What?

15:07.778 --> 15:11.180
Okay, so this new victim

15:11.248 --> 15:12.615
is a Christian scientist,
all right?

15:12.683 --> 15:13.983
Which means he doesn't have
a doctor.

15:14.051 --> 15:16.252
So he never took the pills.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.488
The pill has nothing to do
with this.

15:18.556 --> 15:21.257
Why are you such a slut?

15:21.325 --> 15:22.692
Oh, Myka,
would you please just go?

15:22.760 --> 15:23.960
I'll be out in a minute.

15:24.028 --> 15:26.896
I'm leaving.
Fine. Fine.

15:26.964 --> 15:28.865
Slut.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.767
[Door slams]

15:33.737 --> 15:35.338
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:35.406 --> 15:36.339
Hi, Deb.

15:36.407 --> 15:37.974
This--this was great.

15:38.042 --> 15:40.877
Okay? I mean, this was--
this was really great.

15:40.945 --> 15:42.645
And I'm not--
I'm not just saying it, okay?

15:42.713 --> 15:44.647
And I-I'm sorry that
I have to run off and all,

15:44.715 --> 15:46.649
but I just don't want you
to think that I'm,

15:46.717 --> 15:47.617
you know, that guy--

15:47.685 --> 15:48.718
Pete, listen.

15:48.786 --> 15:49.719
I'm a big girl, you know.

15:49.787 --> 15:50.954
Occasionally, I'm that guy.

15:51.021 --> 15:52.722
- Oh, okay. Dude.
- Yeah.

15:52.790 --> 15:55.892
That's--

15:56.780 --> 15:58.414
But you would've called me,
though, right?

15:58.459 --> 16:00.697
I mean...

16:00.764 --> 16:02.265
Anyway, good news.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.701
Uh, there's--there's no
connection to your pill.

16:04.768 --> 16:06.803
So the last guy
who got taller,

16:06.870 --> 16:08.004
he didn't even take it,
so--

16:08.072 --> 16:10.139
Okay. Uh, wow.

16:10.207 --> 16:11.708
Well, so what do we do next?

16:11.775 --> 16:14.310
Oh, we--

16:14.378 --> 16:17.013
Wow. We--we--we don't--
we don't do anything.

16:17.369 --> 16:18.430
Your company's in the clear.

16:18.494 --> 16:20.242
But listen,
I gotta go, okay?

16:20.289 --> 16:21.451
But--but, Pete.
No, look.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.452
Hey, hey, hey.

16:22.519 --> 16:24.187
I didn't just come here to cover
my company's butt, you know?

16:24.254 --> 16:26.189
