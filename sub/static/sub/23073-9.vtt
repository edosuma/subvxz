10:16.672 --> 10:19.672
I said I was having a party
because I am also a liar.

10:19.672 --> 10:21.880
But that's not as bad
as when you run into them

10:21.880 --> 10:23.005
in the middle of the street,

10:23.005 --> 10:25.130
and they're crying
all over you. Ew.

10:25.130 --> 10:27.755
- Okay, I think that is all
the time we have today.

10:27.755 --> 10:30.588
If you have any more questions
for Dr. Carlson,

10:30.588 --> 10:32.297
you can email them to me.

10:32.297 --> 10:34.088
Let's thank her for coming.

10:34.088 --> 10:36.422
(Applause)
- Oh, thanks.

10:36.422 --> 10:38.588
- And uh, class is dismissed.

10:38.588 --> 10:40.713
See you all later.

10:40.713 --> 10:42.755
Huh. Well, Anne,
I have to say...

10:44.672 --> 10:46.588
I am surprised.

10:46.588 --> 10:49.172
- Oh yeah? I'm not.

10:49.172 --> 10:51.797
- Yeah, somehow you kinda
pulled it off.

10:52.838 --> 10:55.297
- Sure did. (Chuckles)

10:55.297 --> 10:58.922
Thank you. That was a great
opportunity.

10:58.922 --> 11:02.297
- Great. Anytime. Absolutely.

11:05.088 --> 11:06.838
(Paper flaps in wind)

11:08.422 --> 11:10.088
- Excuse me, Dr. Carlson,

11:10.088 --> 11:13.338
I just wanted to say,
that was amazing.

11:13.338 --> 11:15.838
- Oh.
- I just,

11:16.963 --> 11:20.130
I am a huge fan of yours,
Dr. Carlson.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.713
Big time. I'm Carly.

11:22.713 --> 11:24.880
- Hi Carly, it's really nice
to meet you.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.838
I'm glad that you enjoyed
the talk.

11:26.838 --> 11:28.338
- Well, it's not even just that.

11:28.338 --> 11:30.297
I... I read your thesis

11:30.297 --> 11:33.713
when I heard that you were
coming in, and... wow!

11:33.713 --> 11:35.213
- You read my thesis?

11:35.213 --> 11:36.963
- It was so moving.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.505
I know. I'm a really big dork.

11:38.505 --> 11:40.130
I'm sorry.

11:40.130 --> 11:42.255
(Sighs) But you know,

11:42.255 --> 11:44.005
I should really get going
to my next class.

11:44.005 --> 11:47.005
Do you think I could take
you for a coffee sometime?

11:47.005 --> 11:49.713
I would love to share
a donut with you.

11:49.713 --> 11:54.297
Or just... get inside your skin
and be you. (Laughs)

11:54.297 --> 11:55.630
Just joking.

11:55.630 --> 11:57.463
- (Anne laughs)

11:57.463 --> 12:00.838
Yeah! Sure that...
that sounds really nice.

12:00.838 --> 12:02.338
Here's my card.

12:02.338 --> 12:05.380
- Great. That's great I'm gonna
call you.

12:05.380 --> 12:06.630
- Great.

12:10.047 --> 12:12.380
(Small chuckle)

12:12.380 --> 12:13.505
What?

12:14.588 --> 12:16.338
<i> Voicemail: New Message.</i>

12:16.338 --> 12:19.422

12:23.422 --> 12:25.880
She's having her period.
- Oh shit.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.338
Shit! Shit!

12:28.338 --> 12:30.547
♪♪♪

12:30.547 --> 12:32.547
(Engine rumbles and turns off)

12:33.547 --> 12:35.797
- Thanks again for doing this.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.255
I mean, we're still broken up,
and everything.

12:38.255 --> 12:40.547
- Okay, yeah sure, man.
Whatever.

12:42.088 --> 12:45.505
- Just wanna show her
that I'm happy. You know?

12:45.505 --> 12:46.880
- You're not happy?

12:46.880 --> 12:49.630
- Oh I am, I just...
I just wanna look happy.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.880
- Right. So, smile.

12:53.338 --> 12:55.588
- No, I mean I want you
to make me look good

12:55.588 --> 12:57.630
in front of Giselle.
- Oh. I get it.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.422
You want me to make
her jealous.

12:59.422 --> 13:01.380
I got this.
- Okay.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.297
- Yeah, used to this for
my stepmom all the time.

13:04.297 --> 13:05.755
- Okay, cool.

13:05.755 --> 13:07.963
- Can you drive me
to Quizno's after?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.713
- Yup.

13:10.713 --> 13:12.713
(Door squeaks and slams)

13:14.422 --> 13:15.797
(Doorbell rings)

13:15.797 --> 13:17.422
(Door opens)

13:19.963 --> 13:22.630
- Hey... Frank?
- Yo, I'm Juniper.

13:22.630 --> 13:25.130
I'm her lover.
- Okay.

13:26.463 --> 13:28.547
- That's right. Uh, anyway...

13:29.547 --> 13:32.255
- How nice to meet you, Juniper.

13:34.297 --> 13:35.880
- Oh.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.713
Oh... um, Sweet...

13:39.588 --> 13:41.338
so Sweetheart...
- Mhmm?

13:41.338 --> 13:42.922
- Maybe you just wanna...

13:42.922 --> 13:45.088
I'll meet you in the car
in a minute, okay?

13:45.088 --> 13:47.338
- Right.
- Yeah.

13:48.422 --> 13:50.463
- (Whispers) For some sex.

13:53.088 --> 13:55.797
- That was a lot. I'm so sorry.
- Mhm.

13:55.797 --> 13:57.005
(Car door closes)

13:57.005 --> 13:58.880
- Thank you for getting
on board with this.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.213
I mean... buying my part
of the house.

14:01.213 --> 14:03.130
- Sounds like you're
in a good place.

14:03.130 --> 14:06.172
Minus that strange girl.
(Frankie laughs)

14:06.172 --> 14:08.088
- She's...and...
- Mhm.

14:09.922 --> 14:12.422
- Anyway.
(Both laugh)

14:15.672 --> 14:17.963
Thank you.

14:19.005 --> 14:21.422
(Heavy metal plays)

14:25.338 --> 14:27.713
(Footsteps thud slowly)

14:27.713 --> 14:30.047
Alice: Can't believe you
put me in a diaper.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.338
- It's a pull-up.
It's for big girls.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.213
Come here.

14:34.213 --> 14:37.005
(Diaper rustles)

14:39.963 --> 14:43.463
So look, your Mom is gonna call
any minute.

14:43.463 --> 14:46.088
Um, but in the meantime,
has she...

14:47.297 --> 14:49.297
talked to you about this,

14:49.297 --> 14:50.713
or at school maybe,
did they like teach--

14:50.713 --> 14:53.172
- I don't...know.
- Okay, um,

14:53.172 --> 14:55.422
do you have any...
do you have any questions?

14:56.338 --> 14:59.213
- When does it stop?
- Hmm. Uh...

14:59.213 --> 15:01.672
in about 50 years.
- What?

15:01.672 --> 15:03.255
- Okay, look,
- 50 years?

15:03.255 --> 15:05.130
- All right, let's just take
a step back for a second.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.130
So, periods generally
last five to seven days.

15:07.130 --> 15:09.463
- Five to seven days?

15:09.463 --> 15:11.297
- Probably five, unless you're
like a heavy flow,

15:11.297 --> 15:14.005
kinda situation.
- How often?

15:14.005 --> 15:16.797
- Every month.
- Every month?

15:16.797 --> 15:19.505
- Until you're 50...ish.

15:19.505 --> 15:22.047
- But, that's insane.
Are you sure?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.338
- (Chuckles)

15:24.338 --> 15:25.838
Yes, unfortunately I am.

15:26.963 --> 15:30.255
But look, you are now part
of a very cool club.

15:30.255 --> 15:32.755
I mean sure, we bleed every
month, and...

15:32.755 --> 15:35.755
actually our hormones mess
with us almost constantly,

15:35.755 --> 15:38.172
and we're actually very
iron-deficient,

15:38.172 --> 15:41.338
so you have to watch it.
- So, being a girl sucks.

15:42.838 --> 15:45.547
- (Sighs) I know, Sweetie.
I know.

15:45.547 --> 15:47.463
Come here.

15:47.463 --> 15:49.047
(Kate sighs)

15:50.172 --> 15:53.672
- I don't wanna spend the rest
of my life in a diaper!

15:53.672 --> 15:55.380
(Kate chuckles)

15:55.380 --> 15:57.213
- Oh my God, I'm gonna die!

15:57.213 --> 15:58.338
- You're not gonna die.

15:58.338 --> 16:00.005
Hey, you're not gonna die.

16:00.005 --> 16:02.255
You're gonna kick some ass.
You know why?

16:02.255 --> 16:05.005
Because being a girl,
is awesome!

16:05.005 --> 16:07.463
Yes, we have periods,
and they're uncomfortable,

16:07.463 --> 16:09.922
but that's what painkillers
are for.

16:11.672 --> 16:13.797
We birth life.

16:13.797 --> 16:16.172
I'd like to see your Dad
do that.

16:16.172 --> 16:20.130
And on top of that, we can be
doctors, or engineers,

16:20.130 --> 16:22.255
or the President,
you know in some countries.

16:23.588 --> 16:25.213
Hell, you wanna be
a YouTube star?

16:25.213 --> 16:26.672
- Oh my God, yes!

16:26.672 --> 16:29.213
- Well, give that one a little
more thought, maybe.

16:30.338 --> 16:33.630
The point is, we can be
anything we want in this life.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.172
Does that sound good?

16:36.338 --> 16:38.338
Yeah? Come here.

16:39.713 --> 16:41.213
(Kate sighs)

16:43.838 --> 16:45.547
Frankie: Dorothy...

16:46.713 --> 16:48.880
Dor-Dorothy?

16:48.880 --> 16:50.588
Dorothy!

16:50.588 --> 16:52.505
(Shouts) Dorothy!
(Dorothy snorts awake)

16:52.505 --> 16:54.672
- Oh!

16:54.672 --> 16:57.213
I thought... you were so still.

16:57.213 --> 16:58.963
- I was just napping, honey.

16:58.963 --> 17:01.338
Sometimes my eyes only close
half-mast.

17:01.338 --> 17:03.172
It's very common with dry eyes.

17:03.172 --> 17:04.838
- Those were no half-masts.

17:04.838 --> 17:06.672
Those were full moons.

17:06.672 --> 17:08.713
- (Dorothy sighs)

17:08.713 --> 17:11.255
I'm sorry if I scared you.

17:11.255 --> 17:15.130
So, for dinner tonight,
I was thinking...

17:17.130 --> 17:18.963
oh... I see.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.338
- Yeah. I think I gotta...

17:22.338 --> 17:23.963
- Yeah.

17:23.963 --> 17:26.088
Things aren't working out.
Not a match.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.130
- Yeah, yeah.
It's just that it's...

17:28.130 --> 17:29.297
- It's okay, Frankie,

17:29.297 --> 17:30.963
these things tend
to have a shelf life.

17:30.963 --> 17:33.713
- I mean, I don't know where
I'm going, right, but...

17:33.713 --> 17:36.297
maybe it's time to figure
that out.

17:36.297 --> 17:38.755
- I understand. You wanna be
self-sufficient.

17:38.755 --> 17:41.338
- Yeah! It's not like I want my
old life with Giselle back,

17:41.338 --> 17:43.338
but I do really,
really wanna be in a good place

17:43.338 --> 17:44.963
for my daughter.
You know what it is?

17:44.963 --> 17:48.130
I just wanna like order
the wrong Thai food,

17:48.130 --> 17:50.797
and then eat it,
but like, by myself.

17:50.797 --> 17:54.547
Dependent on no one. Just...
- But you.

17:54.547 --> 17:56.047
- Yeah.
- Yes.

17:56.047 --> 17:58.963
Like I've been saying,
self-sufficient.

17:58.963 --> 18:01.422
- Mhm.
- It really is a shame.

18:01.422 --> 18:03.630
You made a beautiful
Constantine.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.880
- Okay, Dorothy, I think um...

18:05.880 --> 18:07.797
I think I'm just gonna say it.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.880
You should get another dog.

18:10.880 --> 18:15.088
♪♪♪

18:15.088 --> 18:16.505
- Oh.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.880
(Knocking)

18:24.005 --> 18:25.505
- Oh God,
thank God you're here!

18:25.505 --> 18:27.213
- Where is she? Is she okay?
- She's fine.

18:27.213 --> 18:29.713
She's totally fine.
Hey, I'm uh...

18:31.130 --> 18:33.630
sorry you missed this moment.

18:33.630 --> 18:35.922
- Well I'm...I'm sure you
probably did the right thing.

18:35.922 --> 18:38.338
- I did.
- She put me in a diaper.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.130
- We did what we could
with short notice.

18:45.005 --> 18:46.422
Where's your nanny?

18:46.422 --> 18:49.338
- Mean Nanny?
She's slacking lately.

18:49.338 --> 18:50.963
I think she's got a boyfriend
or something.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.880
- Oh. (Laughs) Wiccan love.

18:55.047 --> 18:56.422
(Birds chirp)

18:56.422 --> 18:58.297
- Well, I should get her home.

18:58.297 --> 19:00.505
- Yeah, no, please.

19:01.963 --> 19:03.797
- Can you just go wait
in the car for a second?

19:03.797 --> 19:05.630
- Sure.
- Okay.

19:05.630 --> 19:08.297
- Bye, Kate.
Thanks for traumatizing me.

19:08.297 --> 19:09.922
- Hey, I didn't give ya
that period.

19:09.922 --> 19:12.213
- No, just a diaper rash.

19:14.922 --> 19:16.922
- She's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

19:18.047 --> 19:20.255
Look, I know that there's
shit going on between us,

19:20.255 --> 19:21.672
but thank you.

19:21.672 --> 19:23.672
For taking such good care
of her.

19:23.672 --> 19:25.297
- No, of course.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.672
- I know we haven't talked
about your Dad.

19:27.672 --> 19:30.672
- It's not about that.
- I know.

19:30.672 --> 19:32.963
- I mean I guess it sorta is,
but...

19:32.963 --> 19:35.422
- No, I know, it's about you.

19:35.422 --> 19:37.922
I heard you got fired. Twice.
- Yeah.

19:39.838 --> 19:44.213
It's just uh... I think
I ruined my life, Anne.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.380
And I guess I deserve it.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.088
I treated you terribly. I know.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.088
And I let Richard down too.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.713
I don't know what to do,
you know?

19:55.713 --> 19:57.380
I'm uh... really embarrassed.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.505
I should just stay home.

20:00.505 --> 20:02.005
I don't know why I'm trying
so hard

20:02.005 --> 20:04.380
to make this goddamn
career happen.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.172
(Sighs)

20:06.172 --> 20:07.880
- Can I just be real
for a second?

20:07.880 --> 20:10.088
- Yeah.
- You gotta cut the shit out.

20:10.088 --> 20:12.630
What are you doin'?
I don't even recognize you.

20:12.630 --> 20:14.297
You gotta wake up, man!

20:14.297 --> 20:17.588
You didn't let Richard down.
You were loyal.

20:17.588 --> 20:19.422
You were on top of your game.

20:19.422 --> 20:22.380
You had a crisis with your son,
and Gaze punished you for it.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.963
It's not fair what happened.

20:24.963 --> 20:27.713
You don't need those fuckers.
- (Kate laughs)

20:27.713 --> 20:29.505
- You should start your
own shop.

20:29.505 --> 20:31.255
(Heavenly choir sings)

20:31.255 --> 20:33.838
Look at me! You're good!

20:35.297 --> 20:37.838
You can't give up, okay?
You gotta keep going.

20:37.838 --> 20:40.338
If you give up,
I swear to God I'll go...

20:40.338 --> 20:42.463
I will...
I will cut people.

20:42.463 --> 20:44.672
I will go out,
I will drive around town,

20:44.672 --> 20:46.338
I will collect people.
I will...

20:46.338 --> 20:48.963
- Okay, okay, I won't.

20:48.963 --> 20:51.005
Okay. I won't.

20:51.005 --> 20:53.005
(Anne cries)

20:55.130 --> 20:57.463
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, okay.

20:58.838 --> 21:00.297
(Car honks)

21:00.297 --> 21:02.755
<i> Alice: Hello?</i>
<i> I'm in a diaper, here.</i>

21:02.755 --> 21:05.422
(Both laugh)

21:05.422 --> 21:07.255
- Oh God, I missed you!

21:08.338 --> 21:10.172
- I missed you.
- (Anne laughs)
