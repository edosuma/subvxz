Happy valentine's day,

Morning. Yeah, yeah.

Listen, I made you
a waffle sandwich

00:08.943 --> 00:10.709
With bacon and sausage

Not just a stun gun --
a great one.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.079
That thing

Guys don't usually send flowers

They do if they know
what's good for 'em.

you think Kyle

02:34.021 --> 02:35.854
Would spend
hundreds of dollars on roses?

He spent $200 on a date once,
and dinner only cost $20,

send flowers here?

might be from my boss.

john baker.

Mm-hmm. I'd hit that.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.889
Oh,
it's an expression.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.858
It just means
I'd have sex with him.

something going on

Between
you and john baker?

03:17.331 --> 03:19.131
No, no, no, but I just think
he's really hung up on me,

03:19.133 --> 03:20.799
And it would be
so his style

03:20.801 --> 03:22.401
To send flowers here
anonymously.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.702
Well, it seems like

03:23.704 --> 03:25.504
Somebody has a pretty high
opinion of herself,

03:25.506 --> 03:28.073
Which is
a very unflattering trait.

03:28.075 --> 03:31.009
Plus, it's kind of my thing.
Okay, cool it.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.644
John's been
really attentive lately.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.346

to my car every night.

of this valentine's swag.

for me to go out

03:51.832 --> 03:53.565
And get myself
a real boyfriend.

and picking out a puppy.

And for the record,
matt already has a girlfriend.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.892
Eve would be
a total upgrade.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.327
She's pretty hot
for a jock chick.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.696
Enough of the chitchat,
ladies.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.864
We only got an hour here.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.001
There's going to be
a multiple-choice quiz,

08:56.003 --> 08:59.337
A fitness test,
and a short essay on the topic

08:59.339 --> 09:01.806
"Eve --
smart girl who's pretty

09:01.808 --> 09:03.909
Or pretty girl
who's smart?"

09:03.911 --> 09:06.678
Or pretty girl
who's lost her mind.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.247
Look, Eve.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.849
I like you, okay?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.851
And if you want to
go out sometime,

09:12.853 --> 09:14.352
Then you know
where to find me.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.588
But I'm not gonna
jump through hoops for you.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.590
W-- hey, wait.

09:18.592 --> 09:19.758
[ chuckling ]
you can opt out on the hoops

09:19.760 --> 09:21.793
And just do the rope climb,
I mean...

09:23.496 --> 09:24.963
Ugh.

09:28.868 --> 09:31.436
So, we are completely booked
for tonight.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.604
Yeah?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.773
I bet you wish every day
was valentine's day.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.941
Uh, no.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.443
I'd go broke buying gifts
for my valentine.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.912
Uh, a-about that.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.848
That was the biggest bouquet
I have ever seen. [ chuckles ]

09:43.850 --> 09:45.450
Huh?

09:45.452 --> 09:48.253
You're gonna make me say it,
aren't you? Uh --

09:48.255 --> 09:51.623
Look, uh, I th-think
you're a really great guy.

09:51.625 --> 09:55.060
Thanks! I'm glad
I could pull that out of you.

09:55.062 --> 09:59.631
But you have to know how happy
I am with Ryan right now.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.434
Kris, I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.769
Am I misunderstanding
you walking me

10:04.771 --> 10:06.404
To my car every night?

10:06.406 --> 10:09.808
You carry
the bank deposit.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.775
[ chuckles ]

10:10.777 --> 10:12.777
Obviously,
it's very flattering

10:12.779 --> 10:15.080
That you're still
so into me, but...

10:15.082 --> 10:16.548
You need to move on.

10:18.217 --> 10:19.985
[ sighs ] I'm getting
so many compliments

10:19.987 --> 10:22.487
On my new bracelet,
johnny!

10:24.890 --> 10:27.993
Mm.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.495
Isn't it beautiful?

10:30.497 --> 10:33.732
Oh, wow! That's so beautiful,
rachel! [ chuckles ]

10:33.734 --> 10:36.301
Yes. Oh, my god.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.503
You did know that rachel and I
were a thing, right?

10:38.505 --> 10:39.571
Of course!

10:39.573 --> 10:42.140
I am the assistant manager
around here.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.808
I am on top of everything.
[ chuckles ]

10:50.016 --> 10:52.484
Hey.
Hey.

10:52.486 --> 10:56.287
Well, don't even think
about cooking dinner,

10:56.289 --> 10:57.789
Because
I brought it home.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.358
That is sweet,
because I am exhausted.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.695
Hot dogs?!

11:03.697 --> 11:05.096
Yeah!

11:05.098 --> 11:07.899
I saw this guy on youtube
cook these by tasering them.

11:09.702 --> 11:10.969
Then,
if it stops raining,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.604
We can go out and see if
we can blow up this watermelon.

11:12.606 --> 11:15.373
And they say every love story's
already been told.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.376
Listen,
uh, honey, I'm sorry,

11:18.378 --> 11:20.712
But, uh,
I gave the taser away.

11:20.714 --> 11:21.713
Why would you give away
my gift?

11:21.715 --> 11:22.781
It's [chuckles]
not like it was

11:22.783 --> 11:24.382
Some kind of special
valentine's day present.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.483
I gave it to Kristin.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.686
I mean,
we could boil these hot dogs,

11:27.688 --> 11:29.888
But no one's gonna watch <i>that</i>
<i>on youtube.</i>

11:29.890 --> 11:33.391
[ chuckling ] hey!
Some beautiful flowers there.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.560
Somebody
must be excited...

11:35.562 --> 11:37.228
And appreciative.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.332
There was no card.
What?

11:41.334 --> 11:43.568
I know we don't do
valentine's day,

11:43.570 --> 11:45.470
But I got to tell you,
when these arrived,

11:45.472 --> 11:47.872
It was a little like
rubbing salt in a wound.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.241
And lemon.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.880
And alcohol.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.850
Why don't you just say
"margarita"?

11:58.852 --> 12:01.352
I don't know what
happened to the card, honey.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.555
I sent you
those flowers.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.824
[ laughing ]

12:07.860 --> 12:09.661
Okay.

12:09.663 --> 12:10.829
Honey,
I sent those flowers!

12:10.831 --> 12:12.864
Honey, stop!
It's okay!

12:12.866 --> 12:14.833
I got a -- I tell you --
I tell you, I got a receipt!

12:14.835 --> 12:16.735
Let me show you!
I got a receipt.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.604
Yeah, for 25 years,
I know the guy I married!

12:19.606 --> 12:20.839
Right there --
I got a receipt.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.841
It says right there,
"stun gun."

12:22.843 --> 12:24.843
No. Hey!

12:24.845 --> 12:26.745
[ doorbell rings ]

12:26.747 --> 12:27.846
This is ridiculous!

12:27.848 --> 12:29.280
You send flowers,
you lose the card?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.348
What's up?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.117
Hey, mr. B.
Happy valentine's day.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.885
Yeah. It's cold,
and you're all wet!

12:33.887 --> 12:34.853
Yeah, it's freezing.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.422
Yeah. Gee.
Mandy, Kyle's here!

12:37.424 --> 12:39.190
Hey, you sure
it's not for me?

12:39.192 --> 12:41.226
I just said,
"Kyle was here."

12:41.228 --> 12:42.627
It's Kyle?
Why didn't you let him in?!

12:42.629 --> 12:43.628
It's not my boyfriend.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.563
I got my own
ball and chain to deal with.

12:45.565 --> 12:46.798
Hi.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.700
Oh, my god. This is just like
in "the notebook"!

12:48.702 --> 12:49.901
Hey.
[ sighs ]

12:49.903 --> 12:52.303
I just want to leap in your arms
and close my eyes

12:52.305 --> 12:53.705
And pretend
you're Ryan gosling.

12:53.707 --> 12:54.806
Wait.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.608
I got you something better
than a gosling.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.042
[ squeals ]

13:02.314 --> 13:06.417
It's a mountain bluebird.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.887
It is?

13:08.889 --> 13:13.558
Yeah, I, uh --
I-I carved it out of soap.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.560
Oh!

13:15.562 --> 13:17.729
Is the bird
underneath the bubbles?

13:17.731 --> 13:21.900
Uh, I think the bird
<i>is</i> the bubbles.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.903
It was supposed to be
a bluebird -- you know,

13:24.905 --> 13:26.304
Like the one from the park,
our guardian angel.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.839
That is so lame!

13:27.841 --> 13:31.176
No. No, that actually took
a lot of thought.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.412
Followed immediately
by complete absence of thought.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.781
You know what? That's actually
the perfect gift.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.017
I would rather have
a boyfriend who listens to me

13:39.019 --> 13:41.619
And makes me a heartfelt gift
instead of going into debt

13:41.621 --> 13:43.988
Buying something
expensive and stupid.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.291
Am I the only one
who gets this holiday?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.034
[ doorbell ringing ]

13:56.036 --> 13:58.336
I'll get it!

13:58.338 --> 14:00.805
[ sighs ]

14:00.807 --> 14:01.940
Hi, Eve.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.509
Wow. Truffles. Nice.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.711
[ chuckling ] sure beats
a bird made out of soap.

14:06.713 --> 14:10.515
Uh, sit there and don't put
your feet on anything.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.852
Hey, evie.
Uh, who's this?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.854
Oh, this is
my new boyfriend, andrew --

14:15.856 --> 14:18.823
But by a narrow margin.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.558
Could have gone either way.
[ sighs ]

14:20.560 --> 14:21.726
Hello, andrew.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.295
Hello, mrs. Baxter.
You have a beautiful home.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.630
Oh, thank you.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.699
He's polite
and writes a strong essay.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.501
But he's no arm wrestler,
I'll tell you that.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.737
I have carpal tunnel.

14:32.739 --> 14:36.507
Making excuses?
Not a good color on you, andrew.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.809
Got to hand it
to you, Eve.

14:37.811 --> 14:40.645
You actually brought home
a boyfriend for valentine's day.

14:40.647 --> 14:44.415
Yeah. Said I would.
And I don't mess around.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.850
You know,
that's another thing --

14:45.852 --> 14:47.719
I don't mess around.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.690
I'm gonna go get
a soda.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.093
"can I get you anything,
andrew?!"

14:55.095 --> 14:56.327
Oh, he's fine.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.162
He's got to get us
reservations somewhere.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.697
Last-minute
on valentine's day.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.634
[ chuckling ] we'll see what
kind of juice this kid's got.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.671
Hey, Ryan. Squirt.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.673
Hey. Having
a good valentine's day?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.042
Oh, yeah. My boyfriend's
taking me out tonight.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.443
Uh,
he's in the living room

15:12.445 --> 15:13.978
If you want to go
take a look at him.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.881
I want to take a look
at him!

15:16.883 --> 15:19.851

where you taking Kris tonight?

15:19.853 --> 15:21.686
Ah,
Kris is working tonight.

15:21.688 --> 15:25.056
Huh. Mm.
And you're okay with that?

15:25.058 --> 15:26.791
Uh, yeah!
Why wouldn't I be?

15:26.793 --> 15:29.794
Uh, well, apparently,
that john baker guy's into her.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.696
He wants to "hit that."

15:33.265 --> 15:35.033
It's an expression.
You know, it means that he --

15:35.035 --> 15:37.468
Yeah,
I know what it means.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.037
He got her
that big-ass bouquet in there.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.375
John really
sent her those?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.544
Yeah. He walks her
to her car every night, too.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.246
[ chuckling ]
I have a boyfriend now,

how these animals operate.

Oh, hey.

Yeah, uh, I'll -- I'll be back
later to pick up Boyd.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.722
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Got no special plans.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.091
I'll just be here
sorting coins.

Beat it, pip-squeak!

16:03.762 --> 16:06.130
So...

16:06.132 --> 16:08.266
How did you two lovebirds
find each other?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.468
Ran a couple of guys
through a maze,

16:10.470 --> 16:13.671
And, uh, he's the one
that got the cheese!

16:14.673 --> 16:16.474
Hmm. Cheese.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.077
Hey, uh, andrew,
could you go get me a snack?

16:19.079 --> 16:22.480
Cheese, on crackers -- the round
ones, not the saltines?

16:22.482 --> 16:23.548
Oh.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.019
Wow. Nice catch.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.288
Thought you wanted a boyfriend,
not a butler.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.124
It's love, mom.
He's all things to me.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.693
I'm just wondering,
long term,

16:35.695 --> 16:37.862
How happy you're going to be
with a guy

16:37.864 --> 16:39.864
Who does everything
you tell him to.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.300
Well, so far,
I've kind of enjoyed it.

16:42.302 --> 16:45.503

on valentine's day.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.338
Dad got you a taser.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.140
No, your father
is romantic.

16:49.142 --> 16:53.111
It's just...He shows his love
in ways that -- that --

16:53.113 --> 16:55.947
That don't...
Look anything like love.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.349
Mom,
come on. I-I-I saw.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.685
You were disappointed when
these flowers weren't for you.

I mean, I -- sure, yeah.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.555
I mean, I -- there's
a part of me that wishes

Your father would do
what's predictable and expected,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.460
Like --
like valentine's day flowers,

17:09.462 --> 17:13.464

I am so much happier

17:13.466 --> 17:16.034
Being with a guy
who doesn't jump through hoops

17:16.036 --> 17:18.236
Just because somebody
invented a holiday!

Hmm.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.572
Okay!

17:21.574 --> 17:24.175
I've arranged the crackers
into a heart,

Is the arrow.

with each other, you know?

17:41.093 --> 17:42.493

seen this coming.

I was just hoping --

Let's not
draw this out.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.598
Right. [ sighs ]

Well, you know, at least
you guys don't have kids.

That's where these breakups
get messy.

Hey, uh, can I use you as a
referral for my next girlfriend?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.042
Sure.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.378
Can I say we went on
an actual date?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.280

18:02.282 --> 18:04.048
Can I say we made out?

And you just lost
your referral!

meeting you, andrew.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.356
Oh, and I still need you
to proof my history paper!

18:12.358 --> 18:13.791
Oh, wait, uh, mrs. Baxter,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.593
I found this
in your bushes.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.228
Oh. Thanks.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.262
What's all this about?

18:18.264 --> 18:21.265
Uh, Eve's...

18:21.267 --> 18:25.069
Ex-boyfriend, uh,
just...

18:25.071 --> 18:27.638
Found the...The card
for the flowers. Uh...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.706
Interesting.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.309
Yeah. It says,
"to Vanessa."

18:31.311 --> 18:32.643
Huh.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.913
And, um...Uh, look. There's,
uh -- there's a message.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.983
Maybe I have some romance
left in me, huh?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.587
"to Vanessa.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.456
Bet you didn't see
this coming."

18:48.260 --> 18:49.393
"ha!"

18:53.832 --> 18:55.900
"in your face."

18:59.271 --> 19:02.140
"love, Mike."

19:02.142 --> 19:03.741
[ voice breaking ]
Mike...
[ chuckles ]

19:03.743 --> 19:05.810
...Thank you!

19:07.346 --> 19:09.881
Happy February 14th!

19:23.128 --> 19:26.497
You sure you don't want me
to walk you to your car?

19:26.499 --> 19:29.567
Oh, uh, no.
[ chuckles ] I'm covered.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.840
Happy valentine's day!

19:35.842 --> 19:37.508
Right back at you.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.846
Hey, lady.
Aah!

19:41.848 --> 19:42.980
[ electricity crackling ]

19:42.982 --> 19:45.316
Oh, my gosh!

19:45.318 --> 19:46.817
I'm so sorry!

19:46.819 --> 19:51.389
I'm so-- you -- you scared
the crap out of me, ry!

19:51.391 --> 19:53.391
[ strained ]
I haven't checked yet, but...

19:53.393 --> 19:55.693
I think
I'm in the same boat!

19:55.695 --> 19:57.328
Kristin, you okay?
What happened?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.896
Oh, god!

19:58.898 --> 20:01.966
Uh, no, I -- [ chuckles ]
I accidentally tased Ryan.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.368
He's fine.
You -- you should go.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.737
No, stick around!

20:06.739 --> 20:09.240
Give me 5 minutes
to get up to my feet,

20:09.242 --> 20:11.375
And then I'm gonna
kick your ass!

20:11.377 --> 20:14.178
Ryan, honey, nothing is going on
between me and john, okay?

20:14.180 --> 20:15.313
Yeah, th-that's right.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.182
There's no way
I can compete with you.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.251
Oh, honey, flowers?
Baby!

20:27.159 --> 20:32.163
Customarily, at this point
in the valentine's festivities,

20:32.165 --> 20:37.768
The man and the woman
retire to the bedchamber.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.937
[ inhales sharply ]

20:39.939 --> 20:41.172
But I know how you feel

20:41.174 --> 20:43.941
About mandatory
romantic gestures, so...

20:43.943 --> 20:45.776
Hey, hey,
say no more.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.776
This is one area

20:46.778 --> 20:49.213
Where Mike Baxter
and "st. Valentine" agree.

20:49.215 --> 20:50.214
Hmm.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.716
Let's go to bed.
Mm-hmm.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.951
[ both groan ]

20:58.724 --> 21:01.592
You know, Mike, these flowers
really are beautiful.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.628
You act tough,
but you're a softy.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.029
Not a word I'd like used
to describe me

21:05.031 --> 21:06.764
In this
present situation.

21:08.467 --> 21:11.602
But a little romance is not
the worst thing in the world.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.339
<i>That</i> is the worst thing
in the world.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.878
Oh, that's that cute boy justin
from junior rotc!

21:20.880 --> 21:23.781
Two soldiers kissing --
thank you, obama.

21:27.919 --> 21:29.920
[ banging on door ]
