My dad and you were best
friends growing up.

00:04.933 --> 00:06.767

00:06.767 --> 00:08.000
Yeah.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.533
What the hell are you doing
in here, son?

00:09.533 --> 00:11.733
Better get a job, with all the
child support you owe.

00:11.733 --> 00:12.867
Say what?

00:12.867 --> 00:14.300
For your 15-year-old daughter,
Charlotte?

00:14.300 --> 00:16.267
Don't tell me you didn't
know about this.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.633
So you kind of owe me
a small fortune.

00:17.633 --> 00:19.500
Why didn't you ever tell me
I had a daughter?

00:19.500 --> 00:21.167
You pay me $500 a week...

00:21.167 --> 00:22.833
and I don't throw your ass
back in jail.

00:22.833 --> 00:25.600
Well, we were having trouble
finding anyone local.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.867
Don't know what he looks like.

00:26.867 --> 00:28.333
I'm your new preacher.

00:28.333 --> 00:29.967
Hah-hah!
Yeah!

00:29.967 --> 00:32.400
I need you to do my community
service, so I don't get found...

and have to go back to jail.

00:34.533 --> 00:37.800
Aw, hell, the real preacher?
Oh, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.

Whoa!

00:46.467 --> 00:48.433
Uh, Curtis, why don't you
kick us off...

00:48.433 --> 00:51.067
with a little musical
inspiration.

00:51.067 --> 00:52.867
Nice and loud now, Curtis!

00:52.867 --> 00:54.833
Sorry, I didn't mean to bump
into you like that.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.700
Whoa! Slow down there, fella!

00:56.700 --> 00:58.233
I don't know if that's how
you greet your new minister...

00:58.233 --> 00:59.400
around here, but I'm late for--

00:59.400 --> 01:00.467
I just think--
you do not go in there.

01:00.467 --> 01:01.967
Would you please step back!

01:01.967 --> 01:05.133
I want y'all to close your eyes.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.700
Close your eyes tight now,
and don't look up...

01:09.700 --> 01:14.933
and meditate on a time that
you may have hurt someone...

01:14.933 --> 01:16.833
even if by accident.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.067
Don't look up! Curtis,
that goes for you, too!

01:33.700 --> 01:37.067
Sorry about the confusion there,
Pastor, you gotta forgive us...

01:37.067 --> 01:38.633
we've had a rash
of fake ministers...

01:38.633 --> 01:40.800
coming through this area
pretending to be preachers.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.233
They're robbing these little
churches blind.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.200
Wow, unbelievable.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.900
Yeah, it is.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.367
I used to wrestle in college.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.500
So sorry about that, son,
I got carried away.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.700
If you want to be
technical about it...

01:51.700 --> 01:53.533
I'm the one that got
carried away...

01:53.533 --> 01:55.867
and then thrown on the ground.

01:55.867 --> 01:58.767
Actually, I think I might
have a mild concussion.

01:58.767 --> 02:01.233
Well, I guess I'm out
of a job, hah.

02:01.233 --> 02:04.400
Say, hoss, did they happen to
mention where you're stayin'?

02:04.400 --> 02:06.133
They told me a parsonage
would be available.

02:06.133 --> 02:07.900
Oh, I knew they'd drop the ball.

02:07.900 --> 02:11.067

02:11.067 --> 02:13.767
Oh, well, I guess--

02:13.767 --> 02:16.167
I got an idea! How about you
get a motel for the night?

02:16.167 --> 02:19.067
We'll get together tomorrow
for a bite and we'll get you...

02:19.067 --> 02:20.333

02:20.333 --> 02:22.867
You drive safe.
Keep God in your heart.

02:22.867 --> 02:24.967
See you around.

02:24.967 --> 02:26.500
Well, that was easy.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.067
So what looks good to everybody?

02:35.067 --> 02:36.933
Well a lot of things
lookin' good, honey...

02:36.933 --> 02:39.267
but how about we start
with a round of beers...

02:39.267 --> 02:40.733
and see where it goes
from there.

02:40.733 --> 02:43.400
What do you say, Joe?
A toast to new acquaintances.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.100
Hah, no, thank you, Pastor.
I'm not a big drinker.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.867
The big man may not approve.

02:47.867 --> 02:51.267
Plus, between you and me,
alcohol makes me crazy.

02:51.267 --> 02:54.100
Well, we all get a little crazy
on the sauce.

I joined the seminary.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.900

I gotta take a leak.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.300

crazy drunk...

03:16.667 --> 03:18.967
get him around some strippers
and other debauchery...

03:18.967 --> 03:21.833
take pictures of him, and then
tell him we're gonna pass...

03:21.833 --> 03:24.433
them around town
if he doesn't split?

03:24.433 --> 03:25.367
You mean blackmail.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.833
No! We're not monsters.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.800
I just mean, if we
had some pictures...

that show him doing
non-preachery stuff...

07:33.467 --> 07:36.100
Yeah, Zelvis, that was his real
name, believe it or not.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.367
Okay, I know I said I would
just sit quiet...

07:43.367 --> 07:46.600

question about parenting.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.567
Excuse me?
Uh-oh.

07:48.567 --> 07:51.833

been gone for the past 15 years.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.133
Ask him about the sheriff's
daughter...

07:53.133 --> 07:55.200

at least.

fiber, not his past.

of sorts.

08:28.667 --> 08:32.067
Is that so? Please elaborate.

08:32.067 --> 08:33.533
He's very passionate
about boats...

08:33.533 --> 08:35.233
and so he has this boat show...

bring in--

19:42.400 --> 19:45.867
I know we never met before,
but I just wanted to say hello.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.400
See, about 15 years ago--

19:47.400 --> 19:48.600
I know who you are.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.900
Just wanted to introduce myself.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.333
Who's your friend?

19:53.333 --> 19:55.067
Uh, this is Mabel.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.567
Mabel, this is my other
X chromosome.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.267
It's nice to meet you.

19:59.267 --> 20:01.100
You know, I was thinking
that maybe...

20:01.100 --> 20:03.933
I could just give you
a lift home.

20:03.933 --> 20:06.500
I don't take rides
from strangers.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.767
That's good, you never
should, I mean.

20:09.767 --> 20:13.167
I mean, it's good that you know
that, it's important stuff.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.067
Do I have to stay in the back?

20:29.967 --> 20:32.033
( PHONE RINGS )
Uh-oh! We got a caller!

20:32.033 --> 20:33.733
Caller, you're onboard
with Captain Ronnie.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.267
CALLER (OVER SPEAKER)
Hey, Ronnie...

20:35.267 --> 20:37.867
say you had a 1971 Meerkat
Pleasure Cruiser--

20:37.867 --> 20:38.933
and it's named Da Man.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.567
Great name, keep going.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.500
CALLER (OVER SPEAKER) Well,
if the boat started sinking...

20:42.500 --> 20:44.900
would you, like all captains,
go down on Da Man?

20:44.900 --> 20:46.933
Well, that's easy, of course,
I go down on Da Man.

20:46.933 --> 20:50.800
It's my job, nay, my privilege
to go down on Da Man.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.267
( SNICKERING )

20:52.267 --> 20:53.667
CALLER (OVER SPEAKER)
Okay!

20:53.667 --> 20:55.233
Cut! Cut it!

20:55.233 --> 20:57.167
Cut the damn show!
