- Yeah.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.262
Yep.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.598
The monitor behind me
is where you guys can see.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.395
Okay, there's the baby.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.941
And you do wanna know
what you're having, right?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.943

00:26.026 --> 00:28.403
All right, let me just get the baby

00:32.699 --> 00:36.453
It's a boy.
Congratulations.

00:36.537 --> 00:40.123
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm pretty sure.

00:44.336 --> 00:47.089
It's crazy.

-Hey, Sunflower.
-Hey.

-Great, thanks.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.631
Dude, what are you...

01:37.514 --> 01:39.182
Fuck!

01:39.808 --> 01:41.560
Yes! Congrats, dude.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.061
Yeah, I know.
We're very excited.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.855
-Let me see that. Let me see that.
-It was, uh...

01:44.980 --> 01:47.441
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
-Holy shit.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.276
-You made that with your dick.
-I sure did.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.402
-And...
-Yeah.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.154
-...there is his...
-That's his--

01:52.237 --> 01:54.448
- He's got your little baby dick, too.
- That's very funny.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.159
He's... Dude!

01:57.242 --> 01:59.494
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God. How you feelin'?

01:59.578 --> 02:00.996
- I'm feelin' good.
- Yeah?

02:01.079 --> 02:02.080
-That's something--
-Hi.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.832
-Hey.
-Baby. Baby, baby, baby.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.000
What?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.627
-It's a boy! It's... Yeah.
-It's a boy?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.378
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes!

02:08.462 --> 02:09.755
Here, let me show you.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.132
-That's my boy.
-Oh, my God, dude, that is so awesome.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.508
-That's our boy.
-Yes.

02:13.592 --> 02:14.926
You take care of it,
we come and have fun with it.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.053
We have to get dinner soon, okay?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.347
-Okay, that sounds great. Yeah.
-Oh, it's so good to see you.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.931
-It's great--
-Excuse me. Bye.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.558
What are they up to in there?

02:21.642 --> 02:24.019
Oh, dude, these are...
these are the Half Acre guys.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.938
We're doin', like, this collaborative
beer-coffee thing with them.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.273
It's gonna be fucking cool.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.608
By the way, what are you doin' later?

02:29.691 --> 02:31.652
They offered to give me a tour
of their new brewery.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.153
Do you wanna come with?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.992
- It's cool, right?
- It's pretty great, yeah.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.494
-It's pretty impressive.
-Yeah.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.579
-How about that smell, though, right?
-Yeah.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.831
-God, I fuckin' love that smell.
-It's delicious.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.084
It smells delicious.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.252
Dude, do you ever...
you ever brew anymore?

02:49.336 --> 02:50.879
-No, no, no, I haven't brewed--
-No, not at all?

02:50.962 --> 02:51.963
No, I haven't brewed in years.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.423
-Dude.
-Yeah.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.674
Oh, shit, dude.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.135
-What's goin' on, man?
-Good to see you.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.804
-This is my brother Matt.
-Hey, Matt. Gabriel.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.971
Great to meet you.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.306
Thank you so much for having us.
We appreciate it.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.682
-Absolutely. This is fuckin'--
-I'm very excited.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.768
This is awesome.
I can't believe I haven't been here yet.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.061
Yeah, it's cool.
Let me show you guys around.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.022
Please. Please do.
This is... Looks like a lot of fun.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.358
I love all the games you guys have around
and the skateboards and...

03:11.441 --> 03:12.567
Yeah.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.403
We screw around
as much as we can around here.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.904
-Yeah?
-It's kind of part of the gig.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.490
Oh, so this is where
all the fermentation happens, right here?

03:18.573 --> 03:20.033
Yeah, this is where it happens.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.868
Uh, it's where beer becomes beer.
We kinda--

03:21.952 --> 03:24.454
We make all the wort on that side,
pump it over here,

03:24.538 --> 03:25.831
-hooks up with yeast...
-Wow.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.916
...and then two weeks later,
you got beer.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.752
Dude, I was gonna
brew at my place tonight.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.337
You should come.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.547
Say yes.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.756
-Yeah, man.
-Come on, yes. All right?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.091
I gotta check
with Sherri first.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.676
-Okay. All right. Dude.
-That sounds fun.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.469
-Right?
-No, thanks for inviting me, man.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.762
Brothers back together.
Absolutely, man.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.140
-Thank you for coming.
-Yeah. Uncle Jeff.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.853
Man, this is crazy how much
new stuff you have here.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.147
- You like it?
- It's really impressive.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.775
Yeah, man, I got a new boil kettle,
new mash tun.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.152
I went for the big boys.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.029
You did. It doesn't even look
like the same... same thing.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.823
Last time you were here,
I only had the little guys, right?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.742
-I know. I mean...
-Dude.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.952
You check out the, uh,
the taps on the cooler?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.412
-Yeah.
-How about that, huh?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.372
It's, uh, very impressive.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.793
Hey, man, I'm glad you're here.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.004
Yeah, me too, man.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.213
How long again?

04:15.297 --> 04:17.966
Like, um...
like a year and a half.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.969
That has got to be
some kind of record for you.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.473
Hey, man, what can I say?
I get to...

04:24.556 --> 04:27.392
I get to work with my friends, my girl.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.519
I can fuckin' smoke at work.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.021
Yeah, uh, it could be worse.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.064
Hey, didn't I read...
didn't I read in the <i>Tribune</i>

04:33.148 --> 04:35.317
that Dark Matter's, like,
looking to expand?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.027
-That Jesse, like, found a place in LA.
-Going to LA.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.320
-Right. Yeah, I read that.
-Yes, yes.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.322
Yeah, we're... we're fuckin'--
We're killin' it, man.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.656
-That's great.
-It's like... Yeah.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.784
-That is really cool, man.
-I'm, like, good at what I do.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.328
-It feels fucking good. Yeah.
-Awesome. I'm happy--

04:46.411 --> 04:48.413
- Hey.
- Hey!

04:48.497 --> 04:51.416
There you are. Hey.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.587
- How's the brew day goin'?
- Yeah, it's, uh, it's goin'.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.215
Yeah. It's been a lot of fun.
It's cool.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.218
Awesome.
How long until the next hop addition?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.054
Uh, 30, maybe...
maybe 30 minutes.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.514
- Yeah. Makes sense.
- Yeah?

05:05.597 --> 05:08.850
Awesome. That's probably long enough
to smoke this joint.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.311
Plenty of time, yes.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.856
Uh... I don't know.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.484
- When was the last time you smoked?
- Come on. It's been, uh...

05:17.567 --> 05:19.236
- It's been enough time.
- Yeah?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.987
Yeah, I don't need you guys
seein' me get weird.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.739
- Come on, dude.
- All right.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.742
Well, hey, man, if you wanna smoke, smoke.
If you don't, that's totally fine.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.410
We're not gonna think
you're any less cool, all right?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.079
Set yourself free.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.250
Hmm.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.253
You guys need
to monetize this situation.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.712
- Dude.
- That's what you need to do.

05:37.796 --> 05:38.797
You need to make money off of it.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.131
- He talks to me all the time...
- Right?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.467
Every day, every fuckin' day,
dude, I say,

05:42.551 --> 05:45.720
"Let's fuckin'-- Let's do some
underground shit in this garage.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.722
-Let's sell some shit."
-Russ, talk to me about, like...

05:47.806 --> 05:51.476
Just, like, lay it on me.
Lay logistics. Give me the logistics.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.353
I don't know, if we got some ingredients,

05:53.436 --> 05:55.647
like yeast and stuff,
from our brewing friends...

05:55.730 --> 05:57.899
- Yeah.
- Like, 150 bucks most.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.734
150 bucks most, right.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.028
- Yeah.
- So, how much...

06:02.112 --> 06:04.197
how much would you make?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.116
Well, I mean, like, selling--

06:06.199 --> 06:08.451
Selling pints is the most money
you can make.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.453
Well, that's the fuckin' idea right there.
You just--

06:10.537 --> 06:12.122
But we'd get busted in a second.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.125
Russ, what... what could we do?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.919
What could we do that we wouldn't get
fucking caught for it

06:18.003 --> 06:20.088
that we could actually make money on?

06:20.171 --> 06:22.674
- Like...
- I love growlers.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.467
Growlers...
such a good idea.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.469
How many growlers
have we gotten from Half Acre?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.847
- Wait a minute.
- Yes, yes. Holy shit.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.182
Okay, so how much
do you sell a growler for?

06:31.266 --> 06:33.727
- I don't know, 20... 15, 20 bucks.
- Okay.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.395
And then in, like, one batch, how many...

06:35.478 --> 06:38.690
How many growlers could we fill
with one batch?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.610
Thirty, uh...
Like, 60.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.069
That's sick!

06:43.153 --> 06:45.488
- We fill 60, we need to sell seven.
- That's sick.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.906
The rest is all profit.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.950
- That's a thousand...
- Yeah.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.619
That's like $1,060.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.162
Fuckin' math. Fuckin' math.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.581
It's like $1,060, somewhere around there.
$1,050, $1,060...

06:54.664 --> 06:58.585
- You could open up a beer garden.
- Did you say $1,050 profit? Profit?

06:58.668 --> 07:01.129
- So that's, like...
- Matt. Profit?

07:01.212 --> 07:04.132
That's like, uh, what, like 1,000...

07:04.215 --> 07:06.217
That's like 1,000% profit.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.511
Thousand percent--

07:08.595 --> 07:11.389
We're fuckin' do--
We're starting an illegal brewery.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.433
-We can do some, like...
-We are fuckin' doin' it!

07:13.516 --> 07:14.559
-That's confirmed.
-...beer garden shit.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.061
You didn't hate it.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.562
You didn't hate it.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.397
I don't hate it.
I don't hate it.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.316
Trying to wrap my head around this.
So it'd be like...

07:21.399 --> 07:23.401
No name, it's just a fuckin' symbol.
I don't--

07:23.485 --> 07:24.569
Well, like...

07:24.653 --> 07:26.321
Is that pretentious,
or is that fucking cool?

07:26.404 --> 07:28.323
No, that's awesome,
because nobody--

07:28.406 --> 07:29.574
I don't really give a shit
what it is.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.160
- Nobody's done that, like--
- You won't get caught, though,

07:32.243 --> 07:33.828
because, like, it'll just be,
like, an image.

07:33.912 --> 07:34.913
You'd have to, like,

07:34.996 --> 07:40.835
"Oh, well, did you get that beer from that
fuckin' whatever that fuckin' image is?"

07:40.919 --> 07:43.380
If fuckin' Don't Fret made our symbol,
that would be...

07:43.463 --> 07:44.589
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.882
Don't fret.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.218
-He wouldn't do it for, like, any, like--
-Don't you do it.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.970
'Cause he's one of my,
like, good friends.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.554
Don't you do it.
Then that's great.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.931
Make the call. Let's go.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.641
Don't you fret.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.767
Don't you fuckin' fret.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.645
- Hey, don't you fret.
- I feel like I need to take this from--

07:58.728 --> 08:00.230
-No, no, no. Hey!
-Don't you--

08:00.355 --> 08:03.316
Real quick, before we all forget
this conversation ever existed...

08:03.400 --> 08:04.734
- Yeah.
- Yes.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.238
Are we fuckin' making
a fuckin' illegal brewery?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.489
We're doing a brewery!

08:09.572 --> 08:12.033
Are we doin' this, man?
Seriously, I'm serious, man.

08:12.117 --> 08:15.161
Don't fuckin', like, wake up
and pretend this didn't happen.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.372
Yeah. We might need to get this
in writing from him.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.917
- No, this is a good idea.
- Okay, okay.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.379
-1,000% profit.
-This is so cool.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.223
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.516
Shh.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.852
Go back to sleep. Sorry.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.687
It's okay. It's late?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.773
I'm fine.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.073
Hey, boogie nights.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.663
- How'd you sleep?
- So good.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.873
I'm so sorry.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.083
I assume you don't wanna come
to the hardware store

09:02.167 --> 09:04.210
to pick out paint colors
like we talked about.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.671
I don't think I can do that right now.

09:06.755 --> 09:11.009
Okay. Well, I will make you a deal.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.011
I will go to the hardware store

09:13.094 --> 09:16.431
and let you lounge in bed
and drink my delicious coffee...

09:16.514 --> 09:18.391
Oh, my God.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.101
...if you help me paint later.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.396
- Deal.
- All right.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.066
-I can't wait.
-All right. I love you.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.400
I love you.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.640
-You were a little slow.
-Yeah. You gotta keep that tempo up.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.892
- Sorry.
- Toking...

10:00.975 --> 10:03.436
Like, 'cause if--
Like, when you slow down, I slow down,

10:03.520 --> 10:04.813
and it just--
It doesn't sound good.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.481
Yeah. You want to just do it again then?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.358
-Yeah.
-All right. Cool.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.453
-Yo.
-What's up?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.746
Hey, man, can I steal a cup?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.832
-Of course.
-Love you.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.384
- These are so good, man.
- Yeah.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.678
- It's so good.
- Well, yeah, man.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.014
I was just goin' for, like,
older people from the neighborhood.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.473
- Like, super working class.
- It's great.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.558
This guy, I don't know--

11:23.641 --> 11:25.226
This guy's jumpin' out to me.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.979
- I mean...
- It's uncanny.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.772
Like, I want--

11:29.856 --> 11:32.400
-I want you to be our logo, Russ.
-Nah.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.028
Just because I want you to get
as much pussy as possible.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.822
- I'm gonna send some pictures to Matt.
- Cool.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.240
-He is gonna love these.
-Yeah.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.826
All right, let's see.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.588
Baby, can you just take a break today?
Please?

11:53.671 --> 11:56.299
Uh, yeah, sorry.
It's just some work stuff.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.718
This is our baby boy's room,

11:58.801 --> 12:02.263
and we talked about keeping it
a technology-free zone.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.057
You're right.
You're right.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.767
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.518
-Okay.
-I'll make it wait.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.312
-Thank you. I really appreciate it.
-All right.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.772
I know you have stuff to do.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.149
So oxytocin has
a predictable response in the body.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.193
So when a woman is flooded
with that hormone,

12:15.276 --> 12:18.071
she will act in a certain way
that is very universal.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.739
Almost all women look this way.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.159
So this is that contraction
I described to you earlier.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.719
Fuck, I don't wanna do anymore.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.478
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.939
- Oh, my God.
- Dude, that's fucking--

12:53.022 --> 12:54.315
That's beautiful, man.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.566
-It looks--
-What do you think?

12:55.650 --> 12:56.818
Give me mine.
I want one.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.403
That shit looks so real.
It looks so good.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.072
This needs to get on my body immediately.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.783
-Oh, my God!
-I wanna drink with that guy.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.121
Oh, you look so good, baby.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.581
It looks good?

13:10.665 --> 13:12.166
Holy shit.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.961
Guys, I got a ton of work today.
You are both a fuckin' bad influence.

13:16.921 --> 13:21.259
You guys, I feel like...
uh, like, content.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.512
I wouldn't change
a fuckin' thing right now.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.972
- I know.
- Right?

13:26.055 --> 13:28.766
Dance with me.
Dance with me.

13:28.850 --> 13:32.729
There it is. There it is.
Get that shit, Russ.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.400
Hey, Matt, can I talk to you for a second?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.777
Sure, Andy. What's up?

13:48.619 --> 13:51.873
Hey! Uh, could I just talk to you
in my office for a second

13:51.956 --> 13:53.332
about the report you just sent in?

13:53.416 --> 13:56.627
No, what's up? You can just...
What do you need?

13:56.711 --> 13:57.795
I just sent the report.
I know what's in there.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.714
Well, I wanna talk to you
about the, uh, control gap,

13:59.797 --> 14:02.341
'cause it's not in there
and it... it should be.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.970
I called over
to the client and it's more, uh, just...

14:06.054 --> 14:09.015
some jargon
that they put in there for the investors.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.476
But for now, we just gotta put
that control gap in there

14:11.559 --> 14:14.228
so that everything
is where it needs to be, okay?

14:14.312 --> 14:16.856
So just put that back in there.
Thank you. Okay?

14:23.654 --> 14:25.615
Looks good.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.369
All right.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.588
- It looks pretty great.
- Yeah?

14:40.671 --> 14:43.591
Half Acre ain't got shit on us!

14:43.674 --> 14:45.802
These all showed up.
Nothin' was broken?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.678
No, not at all.
Me and Russ checked it all.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.555
All right.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.475
- Right? Right?
- Yeah.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.519
- You saw this, right?
- Dude.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.230
What if we, say...
we give three options.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.606
We also don't wanna overshoot
our audience.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.732
Right.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.069
-'Cause we don't wanna be sticking with--
-Three feels good to me.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.780
Should we just, like, walk through it
and see if it feels right?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.991
- Like, um, we should make a lager. Right?
- Yes.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.036
You know, no other home brewery
has the fermentation control that we have

15:12.120 --> 15:13.162
to actually pull that off.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.415
That would be unexpected, man.
That would be cool.

15:15.498 --> 15:16.707
Is everybody on board with that?

15:16.791 --> 15:18.459
- I am if Russ is.
- Sounds good.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.336
- What do you think, Russ?
- Sounds good to me.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.546
- Yeah?
- My man!

15:21.629 --> 15:24.424
We should replace
the fermenter we're gonna use, okay?

15:24.507 --> 15:26.717
-If that one's gonna come out--
-That would be nice if we could.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.845
We don't have any fuckin' money, man.
We can't just--

15:28.928 --> 15:32.807
That's fine. Don't worry about that.
I'll take care of the capital for that.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.350
Are... are you sure?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.893
Yeah, I mean, we can just--

15:35.977 --> 15:37.937
-I'm not askin' you to do that, man.
-That's fine.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.690
We can just pay it down after,
like, the first few batches or whatever

15:40.773 --> 15:42.525
once we're in a good place.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.193
-It's not a big deal.
-Uh, okay. All right.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.487
-Yeah, that sounds good. Okay.
-Yeah.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.865
Why? Why keep that a secret?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.867
I'm not--
I wasn't keeping it a secret.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.119
It's just, like, when I'm with her,
I just don't...

15:53.202 --> 15:54.537
I'm just more worried about her and, like,

15:54.620 --> 15:56.622
what she's feeling and, like,
what's going on with her.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.959
But, like, what does she think
you're doing right now?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.545
She just-- She knows that...
that we're hanging out.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.297
She just thinks that
you and I are reconnecting...

16:04.380 --> 16:08.301
-Dude, this is--
-But you're, like, starting this thing.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.178
This isn't just, like,
some casual little, like...

16:10.261 --> 16:11.804
-This isn't just hanging out.
-..."Oh, hey!

16:11.888 --> 16:13.723
Oh, yeah, I did that.
I forgot to tell you."

16:13.806 --> 16:16.517
It's not--
I mean, it's like a hobby. I mean--

16:16.601 --> 16:18.519
- This is a hobby? Dude.
- I didn't mean--

16:18.603 --> 16:20.188
She doesn't wanna know your hobbies?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.690
Even if it was
just a fuckin' hobby, tell her.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.941
Imagine, okay, all right.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.818
-Just imagine you were pregnant...
-I don't wanna--

16:25.902 --> 16:27.361
...and I didn't tell you about
any of this.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.113
What would you do?
What would you do?

16:29.197 --> 16:30.990
-I would freak out!
-Exactly!

16:31.073 --> 16:33.868
And you're, like, fuckin' awesome and--
I love Sherri.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.121
I fuckin' love Sherri, but she's just not,
like, the most, like,

16:37.205 --> 16:39.373
"Oh, let's just fuckin' go with the flow.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.001
That's cool that you're starting
an illegal fuckin' brewery."

16:42.084 --> 16:44.587
I just don't understand
why you guys are flippin' out about it.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.464
It's-- I'm sure she's gonna be fine.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.009
I just haven't told her, but I...
I'm gonna tell her.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.219
When?

16:52.303 --> 16:53.679
- Yeah.
- Soon.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.476
It's up to you.

16:59.769 --> 17:00.937
I know.

17:01.062 --> 17:04.607
She just... she made it sound like
stretching is really important.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.234
Just prevents you from getting hurt,
that's all.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.443
I know. I don't wanna tear.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.945
-I just--
-I don't want you to tear.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.864
I want you to think of my vagina
as a beautiful, sexy thing.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.366
She's perfect.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.501
So, I think she said it was, like...

17:25.127 --> 17:28.089
it's, like, ten seconds on,
it's, like, ten seconds off.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.173
Mmm-hmm.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.551
And you can just let me know
when it's... you're done,

17:31.634 --> 17:34.136
and like, you know,
when I've gone far enough, okay?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.596
Okay.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.682
She said it's supposed to be
a little uncomfortable, right?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.392
-Yeah.
-Okay?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.185
-Yep.
-You ready?

17:41.269 --> 17:42.520
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay?

17:42.603 --> 17:43.980
Mmm-hmm.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.404
-Should I stretch more?
-Uh-uh.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.072
Okay.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.074
She said it's supposed to hurt.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.159
-Okay?
-Ten.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.370
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.248
Mmm.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.001
Okay.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.753
-Mmm... you ready? Yeah?
-Okay.

18:07.837 --> 18:08.838
-Yep.
-Okay.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.551
Hey, baby, I--

18:13.634 --> 18:15.886
I should have told you something
a while ago.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.638
I don't know why I didn't.
I just...

18:17.722 --> 18:20.224
-Ten. What? What?
-It just sorta, you know, just...

18:20.308 --> 18:23.936
It's so silly. I mean,
it's not even something to worry about.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.730
-One more. Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.815
-I just... You good?
-Mmm.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.276
I just don't know
why it didn't come up, but...

18:30.359 --> 18:33.613
Jeff and I, we've been running
an illegal brewery out of his garage.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.822
Excuse me? Ten.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.657
I don't really like yelling
at you guys, okay?

18:36.741 --> 18:40.244
It makes me feel old and silly
and like a stupid yuppie.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.497
But this guy? This is my husband,
and we have a child coming.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.083
We know, and we told him to tell you.
We did. I swear to God.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.586
No, no, no.
Excuse me. It's my turn to talk now.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.670
-Okay, okay.
-Right?

18:49.754 --> 18:52.298
I let you talk. It's my turn now.

18:52.381 --> 18:57.887
All I'm saying is he has responsibilities.
I left my job to have a baby.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.474
That means that if he gets in trouble,
we have no income.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.726
So you need to understand
the gravity of that,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.144
and be respectful of me

19:05.227 --> 19:07.229
and the fact that I am a part
of this family.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.483
So next time, you involve me
in these kinds of decisions.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.735
'Kay? Have a great night.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.111
Sorry.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.238
Sorry, guys.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.409
Baby, it's fine.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.412
It's all right.

19:24.413 --> 19:28.793
It's like you're a teenager, like,
hiding pot from your parents.

19:28.876 --> 19:33.130
Like, why would you...
why would you put me in that position?

19:34.090 --> 19:35.466
I can't even...

19:56.862 --> 19:59.824
It's just, like,
every time I see you actually, you know,

19:59.907 --> 20:03.077
goin' after something that you like,
that makes you happy,

20:03.160 --> 20:06.038
you try to stand up for yourself.
And then anytime anyone, like,

20:06.122 --> 20:09.542
pushes back the slightest bit,
you fuckin' crumble, you know?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.169
That's not fuckin' true.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.879
She's my wife.
What do you want me to do?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.548
I'm not just talkin' about her, okay?

20:15.631 --> 20:16.757
What about with work?

20:16.841 --> 20:19.635
Okay, how often do you say
how much you fuckin' hate your job?

20:19.719 --> 20:22.722
But every day,
every day you go in and you fuckin'...

20:22.805 --> 20:24.932
You take it on the face, you know?

20:26.058 --> 20:29.103
Okay, look, I'm not tryin' to...
I'm not tryin' to shit on you, okay?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.229
-Yeah, you are.
-I'm sayin'--

20:30.312 --> 20:31.439
-No, listen.
-It's fine.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.065
I'm saying
you're a fuckin' smart guy, okay?

20:33.149 --> 20:34.400
-Yeah?
-If you wanted--

20:34.483 --> 20:35.651
I like to be counted on, all right?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.319
I think it's important...

20:37.403 --> 20:40.030
...that my wife can count on me,
and that my co-workers can count on me.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.575
-That... that means something to me.
-I--

20:42.658 --> 20:44.326
All right?
You think I can just leave my job?

20:44.410 --> 20:47.538
I have a fucking kid that's gonna need
to go through fucking college.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.622
-Yes, I do.
-Okay?

20:48.706 --> 20:50.416
-I think you can if you wanted it.
-You really are.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.042
You just get to do
whatever the fuck you want.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.919
And that's so great for you.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.380
I'm really happy for you, Jeff.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.424
Not everybody gets to do that.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.925
Jesus Christ.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.969
Fuckin'...

21:02.052 --> 21:04.138
-I'm just-- I--
-...judgmental piece of shit.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.098
You're sitting over there,
telling me how to live my life?

21:06.182 --> 21:09.226
I'm telling you you can be happy
if you want it. That's it.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.562
I just wanna see you happy.
You're not, and it's fucked up,

21:11.645 --> 21:14.148
and it fuckin' hurts me to see that.
That's it.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.200
-I'm fuckin'-- I'm fine, man.
-Okay.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.076
You seem fine.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.245
You do.

21:34.585 --> 21:38.005
All right, man. I gotta...
I got an early morning. I gotta go.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.592
All right.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.311
...want a girl.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.314
I mean, I'm so happy,
and I will be very excited.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.066
-Ladies, here's your beer.
-Thank you.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.567
Be right back to take your food order,
all right?

21:58.651 --> 21:59.652
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.279
That's for you.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.281
Um, I just...

22:06.659 --> 22:09.662
I just really wanted to say
that I'm sorry. Um...

22:10.913 --> 22:14.542
Yeah, I feel like...
I just wanted you to know from me

22:14.625 --> 22:18.629
that I'm really sorry that you didn't
feel like we were including you.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.006
Like, that wasn't my intention at all.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.592
-I know, and it's totally fine, I promise.
-And...

22:23.676 --> 22:27.346
I just... I don't know if it's
my hormones or whatever, but...

22:27.429 --> 22:28.764
-Oh.
-...my issue is with Matt

22:28.847 --> 22:32.142
and not with you guys,
and I'm kind of embarrassed that I even...

22:32.226 --> 22:33.978
No, don't blame it on your hormones,

22:34.061 --> 22:35.980
'cause I hate
when people do that to women.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.106
And, like...

22:37.189 --> 22:40.859
...you're a human being that has feelings
that are valid and real and...

22:40.943 --> 22:44.238
Honestly, like, I would have been
really upset if I had found out that--

22:44.321 --> 22:45.614
-Right?
-Yeah.

22:45.698 --> 22:49.243
You know, that, like, they're doing
this thing that I'm not a part of.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.745
Yes, but the point is
that it's not about you guys.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.789
And I absolutely accept your apology,

22:53.872 --> 22:57.793
but please also accept mine for goin',
like, crazy on you.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.712
No, don't feel bad.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.380
-You know, thank you for inviting me out.
-Yeah.

23:01.463 --> 23:05.509
I always felt like you thought I was sort
of just, like, basic and boring and...

23:05.593 --> 23:06.927
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:07.011 --> 23:10.306
I was always sort of intimidated by you.
And you're so beautiful and...

23:10.389 --> 23:13.058
- Oh, my God, shut up.
- And, like, I just feel like...

23:13.142 --> 23:16.645
No, I feel like you, like, have your life.
Like, I feel like I don't--

23:16.729 --> 23:19.481
Every single day I wake up
and I don't know what's happening to me.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.443
I don't know what's happening next or...

23:22.526 --> 23:23.527
No, are you kidding?

23:23.611 --> 23:25.070
I wanna live vicariously through you.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.364
Please, tell me everything.
That sounds amazing.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.950
I wake up every morning and I have
a schedule right now...

23:30.034 --> 23:32.119
- and I just wanna...
- Anyway.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.830
-I would love to hang out more.
-Yeah, me too.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.354
Hey.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.563
Hey.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.525
I'm really sorry.
Between...

24:04.902 --> 24:10.658
stupid shit at work
and then just feeling like I was...

24:12.159 --> 24:14.870
having to be Dad of the Year
before he's even here,

24:14.953 --> 24:17.998
it just all sort of was fucking with me.

24:18.082 --> 24:22.419
And then I walk into that garage
and I start brewing beer, and I...

24:23.379 --> 24:26.799
forgot how much I loved it, and...

24:28.092 --> 24:30.094
I just sort of got hooked.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.346
And it just was so much fun.

24:32.429 --> 24:37.059
And I just missed having fun
and doing something for myself.

24:37.142 --> 24:41.730
And I felt guilty that I wasn't here
because I wasn't--

24:41.814 --> 24:44.900
I felt like every time I was there,
I was somehow letting you down.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.361
And I don't know
why I didn't fuckin' tell you.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.655
-It was so stupid.
-Hey. Hey.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.949
I get it, okay? I get it.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.369
It's okay.
It's not like you did something, like,

24:55.452 --> 24:57.705
horrible that's gonna destroy our lives.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.456
I got very upset.

24:59.540 --> 25:03.210
But the truth is, I was really upset
because I wasn't a part of it.

25:03.293 --> 25:06.046
And I feel like you've put me
in a position,

25:06.130 --> 25:10.426
or that you think that I'm somehow,
like, becoming a different person.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.179
And I'm the same person,
and I wanna have a good time, too.

25:14.263 --> 25:18.434
And I just... I feel like
I wouldn't have gotten so angry if...

25:18.517 --> 25:23.272
if you had just said exactly
what you just said to me now.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.150
And we could've done this together.
If this is important to you,

25:26.233 --> 25:29.278
if this is what you wanna be doing,
like, I am all in.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.988
Like, I love beer.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.740
-You remember how much I love beer?
-That is so...

25:32.823 --> 25:36.952
Baby, I would love to have you
be a part of the brewery.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.954
-Really?
-You would be so adorable.

25:39.037 --> 25:41.874
I know, I would be so much fun
to have in the brewery.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.753
- I could be sober driver.
- You're always sober driver.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.796
Well, at least till the baby's out.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.590
-Yeah.
-And then I wanna be drunk girl.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.300
Aww.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.174
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:14.258 --> 27:15.509
Hey.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.135
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.139
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.474
-Should we...
-Yeah.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.476
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.817
Sherri, I wanted
to show this to you.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.151
The sweaters that we got.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.404
- Oh, my God.
- Um, girls. Beers?

27:35.487 --> 27:36.488
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:36.572 --> 27:37.656
- Yeah.
- Yes.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.284
-You're having one?
-Yes, I'm having one.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.870
I'm European.

27:43.787 --> 27:46.039
- Right.
- Yeah, it is kind of...

27:46.123 --> 27:48.834
And we wanted you to have one, so...

27:48.917 --> 27:50.752
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.463
Thank you.
That's a little light on mine, huh?
