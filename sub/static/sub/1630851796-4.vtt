TOO LATE TO STOP

00:18.625 --> 00:21.708
Called her over to the house
To go at it no pause

00:21.791 --> 00:24.291
She gon' be working that booty up and down

00:24.375 --> 00:26.708
Just got my tan on, feeling frisky

00:26.791 --> 00:29.416
If we get together, we gon' go kaboom

00:29.500 --> 00:32.000
She likes to scratch, to lick, and to kiss

00:32.083 --> 00:34.500
Her ass is deadly
Leaves me out of breath

00:34.583 --> 00:37.083
I begin to grind ya
I know how to tease ya

00:37.166 --> 00:38.583
I can't hold on anymore

00:38.666 --> 00:40.208
It's too late to stop

00:41.666 --> 00:43.583

00:43.666 --> 00:45.000
She won't stop…

00:45.083 --> 00:47.333
Damn, people are commenting.

00:47.416 --> 00:50.041
THE VIDEO IS INSANE

00:50.125 --> 00:54.166
-I sent you the routine video.
-Man, I'm falling in love here.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.291
-Can you be more professional?
-I mean the routine.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.166
You're taking off, man.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.250
We'll be bigger than Theo Ribeiro.

01:01.333 --> 01:04.583
Theo Ribeiro my ass.
Kevinho's gonna want to collab.

01:04.666 --> 01:06.875
-Refresh your YouTube.
-Let's.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.000
I bet you're trending.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.416

We killed it.

01:25.958 --> 01:27.916
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.208
Should've reached one million by now.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.166
Damn!

01:43.208 --> 01:44.791
-Cool, huh?
-Insane.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.041
-It's huge!
-My God!

01:47.125 --> 01:49.375
Imagine watching soccer on this.

01:50.125 --> 01:53.125
Remember what you promised
when you proposed to me?

01:54.375 --> 01:56.666
That my two queens
would never go through hardship.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.125
And now we've got a prince.

02:00.083 --> 02:03.625
-Nando, look how perfect this is.
-You can see everything!

02:03.708 --> 02:05.500
He's got his daddy's mouth!

02:05.583 --> 02:06.833
And his cheeks.

02:07.666 --> 02:09.458
Bruninha had none of this.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.833
We'd wait for hours in the hospital.

02:11.916 --> 02:12.833
I remember.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.708
No one knows
what we had to do to get this far.

02:17.500 --> 02:19.708
Our kids will have everything.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.291
We can afford all of this, right?

02:24.875 --> 02:26.791
If I wasn't a go-getter,

02:27.291 --> 02:29.791
we'd still be living in that alleyway.

-Amen.

03:11.791 --> 03:12.958
Morning, Pastor.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.666
Morning. God bless you.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.375
-Morning, Levi.
-Hey, Rita.

03:16.458 --> 03:19.166
-Good morning, sis.
-You're in high spirits.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.666
-I'm in such a good mood.
-Good for you!

03:21.750 --> 03:24.833
My parents just confirmed.
They're coming at 3:00 p.m.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.041
Great.

03:26.541 --> 03:29.458
Let's get moving. There's a lot to do.

03:29.541 --> 03:31.208
Rita, you can't fool me.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.833
Your great mood has a name.

03:33.916 --> 03:36.958
-Stop it, Cacau.
-You're into him, aren't you?

03:37.541 --> 03:38.750
Okay, I kinda am.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.250
But it's complicated.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.041
No, it isn't, Rita.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.416
He's into you too. It's obvious.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.166
I don't know.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.416
-He's not from around here.
-But he's here.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.750
Enough gossiping. Let's get to work.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.500
There's lots to do.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.666
Let's get to a million. Make it count.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.541
Hype it up.

04:15.166 --> 04:16.750
God bless, brother.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.833
The numbers will blow up.

05:24.916 --> 05:26.083
Fuck marketing.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.291
If they like the song, it blows up.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.458
Not marketing.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.166
People don't know me yet.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.416
What if we go live
with someone more famous?

05:35.500 --> 05:38.291
We sing the song and do the TikTok dance.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.500
The load arrived?

05:41.583 --> 05:43.208
It's coming. Don't worry.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.250
Too many palms to grease, you know.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.583
Sorry to pressure you.
It's a lot of money on the line.

05:49.666 --> 05:52.166
Chill. We didn't get busted.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.666
You know what to do to be sure.

05:54.750 --> 05:55.833
I'll crush that rat.

05:56.958 --> 05:59.125
He's caused us too much loss.

06:00.166 --> 06:03.208
That's all, bro. Peace out.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.125
-Everything's on track, right?
-Thank God.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.833
Praise the Lord.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.541
My parents will be impressed.

06:18.875 --> 06:21.666
I've been asking God
if you're right for me.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.000
Why don't you ask him too?

06:27.791 --> 06:29.541
-I already did.
-So?

06:31.041 --> 06:32.416
No answer just yet.

06:36.416 --> 06:40.000
-Oh my God! Hurry!
-The pipe burst!

06:44.541 --> 06:46.375
God have mercy!

06:47.250 --> 06:50.333
I'll cancel with the pastors.
This will take hours.

06:50.416 --> 06:53.458
It's either calling it off
or showing them this.

06:53.541 --> 06:55.166
Let's brush it up, Sueli.

06:55.250 --> 06:58.000
The facade is great.
We have tons of donations.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.375
That's right.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.916
Rita, give Cacau the squeegee
and go get the donations.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.333
-That'll speed things up.
-Okay.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.125
-I'll drive you, Rita.
-Yes, go.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.666
-Good to see you.
-You too. Did you miss me?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.541
Gotta find out who the rat is.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.000
It's my load and your money on the line.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.375
I'm tailing his cop buddy.

07:46.208 --> 07:49.291
They're setting up a sting operation.
He'll be there.

07:49.958 --> 07:52.833
This guy and your rat
will probably meet up.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.541
Don't get off his ass.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.125
Alright?

08:04.041 --> 08:07.000
We're catching that fucker tonight.
Keep pushing.

-Hi, Auntie.
-Hi, sweetie.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.916
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

08:41.541 --> 08:44.250
-Need any help?
-That's all right, dear.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.458
It's just paperwork.
Who's this handsome man?

08:47.541 --> 08:51.166
This is Levi.
He's helping me restore the church.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.416
-Peace be with you, honey.
-Likewise.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.750
What a beautiful job you're doing.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.625
-Amen.
-Thank you, Auntie.

08:57.708 --> 08:58.791
Good afternoon.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.416
I'll get your stuff in a minute.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.333
Let me help that man.
Make yourselves at home.

09:06.416 --> 09:08.041
-Okay.
-Excuse me.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.875
My bread rolls, darling.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.375
I'll go get them.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.291
Levi, I'll be right back. Stay here.

09:56.583 --> 10:00.041
Doni, can you tell us
what was your inspiration

10:00.125 --> 10:01.250
for the first song?

10:01.333 --> 10:04.875
When I was a kid,
I had a crush on this girl.

10:04.958 --> 10:07.541
She didn't look at me,
so I wrote the song.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.208
You poor thing! What about now?

10:10.291 --> 10:13.166
Is there anyone who inspires you? Tell us.

10:15.458 --> 10:16.666
There's a girl.

10:17.666 --> 10:20.375
Let's talk about the song
because it's dope.

10:20.458 --> 10:21.791
Let's get Luzi here.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.250
Luzi, come here!

10:24.083 --> 10:25.166
What's up?

10:25.250 --> 10:28.208
Tell us how this partnership came to be.

10:28.291 --> 10:31.333
Doni and I have known each other
since childhood.

10:31.416 --> 10:34.750
He's very close with my cousins,
Jaspion and Rivaldinho.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.833
Sup!

10:35.916 --> 10:38.541
MIRO'S AT THE STORE,
YOUR MOM'S ACTING WEIRD

10:38.625 --> 10:40.125
-PLEASE COME
-ON MY WAY

10:40.208 --> 10:42.333
-We wrote it together.
-Beautiful.

10:42.416 --> 10:44.875
-Show us the TikTok dance.
-Alright!

10:44.958 --> 10:46.625
-Slay!
-Turn it up.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.500
Everything okay?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.083
Yeah, fine.

10:51.583 --> 10:54.208
Something happened
with my mom. I'm worried.

10:54.291 --> 10:57.208
Wanna call it a day?
We can finish this later.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.333
Family comes first.

11:02.666 --> 11:03.958
You rock, Tally.

11:10.750 --> 11:14.208
Levi, why don't you head back?
I can take care of this.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.041
-What's going on?
-Go.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.416
Check if they fixed the pipe.

11:18.916 --> 11:21.416
You're not coming? What's going on?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.916
My auntie is in trouble. I need to stay.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.375
Your parents are coming. Go greet them.

11:28.833 --> 11:32.416
We stay, help your auntie,
then we go back.

11:32.916 --> 11:33.958
Okay?

11:40.375 --> 11:41.916
Skimping this week?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.666
-I had a problem, but--
-You have one hour.

11:45.875 --> 11:46.791
Okay?

11:47.291 --> 11:50.833
You always help us. We'll help you too.

11:51.583 --> 11:52.500
See you soon.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.875
Hey, Nando. What's up?

12:11.958 --> 12:13.500
Hey, bro. All good?

12:13.583 --> 12:15.416
How's the ball thing going?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.458
Stay on top of it.
We can't have cops around today.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.958
The kids start it anyways.
I could give them a beating.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.416
That's not how we do it, Formiga.
Do you understand, bro?

12:26.041 --> 12:27.541
Just talk to them.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.833
They're just kids. Don't be afraid.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.416
I had them delete their posts about it.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.500
People heard about it,
and they all gave me a hard time.

12:36.583 --> 12:37.625
It's tough.

12:37.708 --> 12:41.583
Just make them follow the rules
so the cops are not called.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.791
Bro, they're posting about it again.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.125
Let it slide, bro.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.625
Please. I'll get the hang of it.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.791
Fine, I'm on my way.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.333
I'll wait for you here.

12:57.375 --> 12:58.291
DONI
ON MY WAY

12:58.375 --> 13:00.791
-I'll go talk to her.
-Sure, go.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.500
Rita, I'll take the donations later.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.875
I need to run an errand now.

13:07.958 --> 13:11.041
What's going on, Auntie?
I need you to be honest.

13:11.125 --> 13:14.000
I got tangled up in something.
Don't worry, Rita.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.916
Of course not.
You're always helping us out.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.750
Let me help you. What's going on?

13:21.916 --> 13:22.833
It's…

13:23.416 --> 13:25.750
The store was not doing so good,

13:25.833 --> 13:28.583
and I borrowed some money from Miro.

13:28.666 --> 13:29.791
Auntie, from Miro?

13:29.875 --> 13:33.041
Why didn't you come to us
or talk with Doni?

13:33.125 --> 13:35.875
Doni is busy doing his things.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.083
-I don't want to bother him.
-My God.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.125
How long has this being going on?

13:40.208 --> 13:42.375
Not long. It's not a lot of money.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.791
I'll pay it off by the end of the month.
It will be fine.

13:45.875 --> 13:48.708
If you exceed the transfer limit,
Doni can bring it.

13:48.791 --> 13:49.791
No!

13:50.416 --> 13:53.833
I don't want him to get involved.
He's got a new song.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.125
You're family to me.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.708
We'll sort this out when he comes back.

13:58.791 --> 13:59.666
How much?

14:03.791 --> 14:05.416
A little over 20 grand.

14:06.416 --> 14:09.625
Listen, if Donizete hears
Miro is involved,

14:09.708 --> 14:11.250
he's not gonna be happy.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.875
And that man is dangerous.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.958
How are things?

14:25.041 --> 14:28.083
My parents are pulling up,
but they fixed the pipe.

15:08.875 --> 15:12.250
Doni, I promised Auntie
I wouldn't tell you about Miro.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.916
Fine, but why did he come?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.458
It seems she had a few problems

15:16.541 --> 15:18.250
and had to borrow from him.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.708
-She didn't tell me.
-She didn't want to bother you.

15:20.791 --> 15:23.875
You know your mom.
Take it easy. She's nervous.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.875
Let's fix this before he returns.
Got any cash on you?

15:28.375 --> 15:30.875
My checkbook,
but I want to understand this first.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.291
Looking good, Donizete.

15:33.791 --> 15:37.083
Even forgot your old friends.

15:42.166 --> 15:43.083
Hey, Miro.

15:43.625 --> 15:47.333
I've been traveling the country.
Not much time to come by.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.708
Well done, Donizete.

16:07.791 --> 16:10.833
Traveling across the country,
enjoying your success.

16:10.916 --> 16:13.750
CACAU - THEY'RE HERE.
ARE YOU COMING BACK?

16:13.833 --> 16:15.791
You even forgot our business.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.291
Tell the pastor to buy time
showing them around.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.583
Gotta work today
to reap the benefits tomorrow.

16:24.666 --> 16:27.166
Sure. So my mom owes you money?

16:28.333 --> 16:29.416
What?

16:30.958 --> 16:33.916
-Your mom?
-I paid my debt off ages ago.

16:35.458 --> 16:40.375
Oh, apparently Doni boy
needs to have his memory refreshed.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.083
Well, let's see.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.875
Wasn't it your debt?

16:48.125 --> 16:50.791
He's extorting you.
Why didn't you tell Doni?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.791
I couldn't, Rita.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.375
The boy just lost his father.
He's living his dream.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.416
NANDO

17:07.500 --> 17:12.083
TROUBLE AT THE STORE.
DONI AND MIRO. PLEASE COME.

17:12.916 --> 17:15.083
Nando, we just wanna talk,

17:15.166 --> 17:16.958
figure out how it's gonna be.

17:17.041 --> 17:20.708
At the end of the month,
don't we have bills to pay?

17:20.791 --> 17:22.625
I'm a single mom. I gotta work.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.041
I'm not trying to get in the way.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.041
-Let's talk.
-Listen, Jussara.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.916
I want the best for everyone.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.958
-So do we.
-The ball is back on.

17:32.041 --> 17:32.958
With rules.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.666
Everyone's gotta chip in for clean-up

17:35.750 --> 17:37.541
and no music after 3:00 a.m.

17:37.625 --> 17:40.750
We can't have the pigs around.
It's a key moment.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.083
Understood?

17:42.791 --> 17:43.791
Yes, Nando.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.583
We're in the same boat.

17:46.416 --> 17:48.916
Everyone's happy now, right?
Thanks, Nando.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.250
It's a trial run.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.791
If anything goes wrong, it's all over.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.041
You hear me? For good.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.916
Okay, Nando. Come on, Ju.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.500
We gotta get organized.

18:00.583 --> 18:03.250
I'm always the one
who does all the talking.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.250
-So I don't talk?
-You do, but you're too soft.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.708
Be more aggressive.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.458
Your parents must be asking about you.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.875
-Don't worry about it, Rita.
-I mean it.

18:13.958 --> 18:16.041
Things are going to heat up here.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.791
Exactly. I can't leave you behind.

18:25.958 --> 18:29.166
Well, you got the money on the 1st, right?

18:29.250 --> 18:33.791
-I gave you 30k by the end of the month.
-It was after, actually.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.125
Remember the terms?

18:36.208 --> 18:39.541
Ten percent on the first month,
twenty on the second…

18:39.625 --> 18:41.291
Thirty on the third, I know.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.625
Smart boy.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.583
But you forgot the interest.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.166
Are you trying to rip me off?

18:48.666 --> 18:50.416
How much is it, Mr. Miro?

18:50.916 --> 18:53.916
Well, since one month went by

18:54.000 --> 18:56.791
and you didn't pay the interest,

18:57.541 --> 19:00.333
it's 10% of 30 grand, so it's 3 grand.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.791
We add up the previous months…

19:03.875 --> 19:07.041
It's 3 grand plus 20%…

19:08.083 --> 19:10.333
30%, 40%…

19:11.958 --> 19:14.791
50%, 60%…

19:16.750 --> 19:20.250
90%, plus 100%…

19:21.458 --> 19:24.458
After ten months, it adds up to…

19:24.958 --> 19:29.041
R$ 201,132.77.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.750
You gotta be kidding me.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.208
Relax.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.583
You can pay by the end of the week.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.708
I'll do better.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.708
If you pay it today, I can do 180.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.541
Can't let them snarl.
Gotta stand your ground.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.625
Man, Jussara is a tough bitch.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.875
Too feisty. I don't like her.

19:49.958 --> 19:52.750
That's why you can't let her snarl.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.916
-Is the load ready?
-We're cool.

19:55.416 --> 19:56.458
But running low.

19:56.541 --> 19:59.208
We may have to close the shop
for a few days.

19:59.291 --> 20:02.291
Fuck. I can't catch a fucking break.

20:02.791 --> 20:05.125
The sooner we settle, the better.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.791
Son, just pay him. We'll figure it out.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.625
He's acting in bad faith.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.208
I'm calling the brothers.

20:11.291 --> 20:14.250
Good, call them. Call Badá too.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.916
Call your guys. Call everyone.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.916
All the more people to explain it to you.

20:21.958 --> 20:23.000
The brothers?

20:23.958 --> 20:25.375
How did we do this week?

20:25.458 --> 20:26.666
Sales are up.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.791
If all goes well,
we'll make a week's worth in a day.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.500
-Good.
-It'll be a relief.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.291
We can't take risks.

20:34.416 --> 20:35.875
Levi, you should go.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.791
No, I'm staying.

20:39.416 --> 20:40.583
You may need me.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.541
On speakerphone.

20:55.541 --> 20:58.833
-The ball is your responsibility.
-Okay, I got it.

21:00.291 --> 21:02.000
Give the people some attention.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.250
Hey, brother. How are you?

21:04.333 --> 21:05.666
Hey, Nando. What's up?

21:05.750 --> 21:08.250
Miro is being unfair with me.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.416
Hadn't you paid off your debt?

21:12.958 --> 21:15.458
I had, but he came back full of bullshit.

21:15.541 --> 21:18.208
He came up with 200 grand in interest.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.750
Today, 180.

21:19.833 --> 21:23.041
He brought an off-duty cop
to scare my mom.

21:23.833 --> 21:25.458
Hold on. I'm on my way.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.583
Leave Magrelo in charge. You come with me.

21:29.666 --> 21:30.500
What's up?

21:30.583 --> 21:32.791
Miro's fucking with my auntie.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.291
-Fuck no.
-Get in.

21:40.625 --> 21:41.541
Here, Auntie.

21:42.416 --> 21:44.041
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Sure.

21:47.458 --> 21:51.541
Son, why mess with those people?
You have a family.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.708
I needed the money for the video.
Dad was mad at me.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.750
But I've always supported you!

21:56.833 --> 21:59.208
I know, but it was a lot.
And I paid it off.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.375
Follow me, please.

22:05.458 --> 22:09.041
CACAU - WHERE ARE YOU?
WE'VE RUN OUT OF EXCUSES

22:09.125 --> 22:10.708
My dad's asking about me.

22:11.583 --> 22:15.083
I've run out of patience, Donizete.
I want the 200 grand today.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.333
Wasn't it 180, Mr. Miro?

22:18.791 --> 22:20.333
She's a cheeky one.

22:22.708 --> 22:26.000
Hey. I didn't know this one.

22:43.583 --> 22:45.375
-Hi, Auntie.
-How are you, son?

22:45.458 --> 22:47.416
Good, thanks. Hey, brother.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.416
-Cool.
-Ritinha?

22:50.875 --> 22:52.166
Hello, Mr. Miro.

22:52.666 --> 22:54.666
Always a pleasure, young man.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.125
I paid it off before the month's end.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.833
I had just signed with the label.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.416
Yes, I remember.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.125
You arrived all happy.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.458
Two hours late.

23:10.541 --> 23:12.791
Late my ass. I paid my debt and left.

23:12.875 --> 23:15.791
-Tone it down, bro.
-You took me there, remember?

23:16.625 --> 23:17.708
When was it?

23:17.791 --> 23:18.791
-Nov 30th.
-Dec 1st.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.208
What the fuck?

23:20.291 --> 23:22.375
You were driving that red Golf.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.125
What did we do after?

23:24.208 --> 23:27.250
You dropped me off
and were late for something.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.708
Bruninha's birthday.

23:43.791 --> 23:46.083
-That was after.
-It was December 1st.

23:46.166 --> 23:48.500
-I had her gift.
-I asked for your help.

23:48.583 --> 23:52.000
I'm straight up, Doni.
I do what's right. That's how it is.

23:53.583 --> 23:56.083
-Do you have the money?
-Of course not.

23:56.166 --> 23:59.291
He's right, man. You gotta pay.
I can't do anything.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.458
Nando, I don't have all this money.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.791
-What about your car?
-Sell it and pay me.

24:04.875 --> 24:07.583
Hold it, Mr. Miro.
I'm the one negotiating.

24:07.666 --> 24:10.750
Wait. What about the money
he took from Auntie?

24:12.541 --> 24:13.458
What money?

24:13.541 --> 24:16.916
I saw Auntie putting money
in a paper bag for him earlier.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.125
How come, Mom?

24:21.208 --> 24:23.208
He's been shaking her down, Nando.

24:23.291 --> 24:26.250
Using Doni's debt
to get money and terrorize her.

24:29.708 --> 24:31.125
Is this true, man?

24:31.208 --> 24:34.000
You've dragged out my debt
to come after her?

24:34.083 --> 24:37.833
Do you take me for someone
who collects problems?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.458
Auntie, we are family.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.333
What's going on?

24:46.041 --> 24:49.416
-Enough, Luiz Fernando.
-Why didn't you tell me, Mom?

24:49.500 --> 24:51.208
What did Miro do to you?

24:51.291 --> 24:54.583
Look, as far as I know,
talking to her is not a crime.

24:54.666 --> 24:56.916
Where are you trying to get with this?

24:57.500 --> 25:01.583
Auntie, you don't deserve
what he did to you.

25:10.541 --> 25:13.000
When he came by for the first time,

25:13.583 --> 25:17.416
he told me Doni had
unresolved business with him.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.708
That it wasn't much,
that I could take care of it myself

25:21.791 --> 25:23.708
without having to bother my son.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.375
But he came back,

25:27.166 --> 25:30.000
saying there was interest left unpaid.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.750
Doni was so happy.

25:35.833 --> 25:37.958
My boy was living his dream.

25:39.208 --> 25:40.833
I didn't want to worry him.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.916
The next time Miro came,
I said I wouldn't give him another dime.

25:49.750 --> 25:53.208
But he said he had eyes on Doni.

25:54.416 --> 25:55.958
That he knew where he was.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.708
He kept sending me photos.

25:59.833 --> 26:00.666
He said…

26:05.125 --> 26:07.208
he'd do terrible things to him.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.000
That he'd give him a scare.

26:13.708 --> 26:15.541
That he'd break every bone in his body.

26:17.791 --> 26:20.000
I just wanted to keep Doni away from it.

26:29.291 --> 26:30.291
Calm down.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.625
Take Auntie and go home.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.291
You messed with working people.

26:43.041 --> 26:44.541
That's a different level.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.750
Dismiss your little cop.
We're getting our boots dirty.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.083
Okay.

26:51.750 --> 26:54.708
I'm gonna call my partners from the North.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.833
Hey, Peixe. What's good?

27:00.541 --> 27:03.750
Nando from Vila Áurea
is suggesting some weird shit.

27:03.833 --> 27:06.958
Can you help us settle the matter?

27:07.041 --> 27:09.791
Friends with thugs and cops.
That's fucked up.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.333
Piece of shit.

27:11.833 --> 27:12.833
Luiz Fernando.

27:14.208 --> 27:16.041
Promise before God…

27:19.208 --> 27:20.625
there won't be violence.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.458
Take that with you, man.

28:12.916 --> 28:13.833
Auntie,

28:14.833 --> 28:16.500
I'm sorry Doni isn't here.

28:17.833 --> 28:19.500
I shouldn't have interfered.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.708
I just want him back home, Rita.

28:25.416 --> 28:26.333
That's all.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.208
But he's with Nando.

28:32.416 --> 28:33.833
He's safe, Auntie.

28:38.083 --> 28:41.166
I couldn't see that guy
exploiting you and look away.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.166
I know, darling.

28:45.750 --> 28:47.125
You're my second mom.

28:49.541 --> 28:51.041
We'll pray for Doni.

28:51.958 --> 28:52.791
Okay?

28:58.541 --> 29:00.083
PENTECOSTAL CHURCH

29:00.166 --> 29:01.333
Dear Lord…

29:04.458 --> 29:06.250
I praise you and thank you

29:07.375 --> 29:10.250
for my friend's life
and the lives of all kids on Earth.

29:12.750 --> 29:16.500
May your grand love
and your protection fall upon him.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.250
I leave it in your hands, Father.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.375
The life of your beloved son.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.791
The blood of Jesus.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.416
-Glory to God!
-Hallelujah.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.500
Your will be done, Father.

29:33.875 --> 29:34.750
-Amen.
-Amen.

29:34.833 --> 29:36.000
-Glory to God.
-Amen.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.125
What's up, guys?

29:46.208 --> 29:47.041
What's up?

29:47.625 --> 29:48.625
All good?

29:50.083 --> 29:52.708
-Evening.
-How's it going?

29:52.791 --> 29:53.625
All good?

29:56.041 --> 29:57.541
What's good, everyone?

30:01.916 --> 30:03.583
Sup, family.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.625
-Good evening.
-Evening.

30:06.208 --> 30:10.166
Good evening. Peixe in the area.
Happy to talk to you.

30:11.583 --> 30:12.458
I don't follow.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.625
We have no business
meddling with loan sharks.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.500
What are we here for?

30:17.583 --> 30:20.583
Brother, Miro did some shitty stuff.

30:20.666 --> 30:23.708
He harassed an old woman
for a debt that wasn't hers.

30:23.791 --> 30:24.875
Explain, Miro.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.083
The boy doesn't want to pay his debt

30:28.166 --> 30:30.958
and is making stuff up, that's all.

30:31.041 --> 30:34.083
Nando, with all due respect,
you're Doni's friend.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.958
Let me handle this business.

30:37.041 --> 30:39.750
Though Doni and his mother
are family to me,

30:39.833 --> 30:42.041
we're both gonna handle this, okay?

30:42.625 --> 30:44.458
Tell him the whole story.

30:46.250 --> 30:49.291
So, he kept chasing my mom for money,

30:49.375 --> 30:51.291
saying she had to pay my debt.

30:51.958 --> 30:53.541
Is that right?

30:53.625 --> 30:56.875
Miro, why didn't you reach out to the kid?

30:56.958 --> 30:58.250
My dad is deceased.

30:58.750 --> 31:01.166
My mother was an easy target.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.833
Miro, speak the hell up.

31:03.916 --> 31:06.666
Man, I didn't take any money.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.041
Where's the evidence?

31:08.125 --> 31:10.000
How do we know he did it?

31:10.083 --> 31:12.791
Brother, the money is in his pocket.

31:12.875 --> 31:16.625
-In a paper bag.
-What the hell is wrong with this douche?

31:17.208 --> 31:19.958
Do you confirm it, Miro?
Lying is worse, man.

31:20.458 --> 31:22.500
Here's the thing.

31:22.583 --> 31:25.166
When a boy cuts a deal with a shark,

31:25.250 --> 31:27.375
his entire family is on the line.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.166
That's how it works, man.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.958
Shady fucker! Going after the family?

31:32.041 --> 31:33.791
On top of my mother's money,

31:33.875 --> 31:35.541
he charged the debt in full.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.416
On top of the money
you got from the woman?

31:38.500 --> 31:41.791
This is fucked up, man. Do you confirm it?

31:42.541 --> 31:44.041
Start talking, man.

31:45.166 --> 31:47.416
-Don't freeze.
-Piece of shit.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.291
Don't give me bullshit,
or this will get ugly.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.583
Speak up.

31:51.666 --> 31:53.041
Are you choking, bro?

31:53.125 --> 31:55.583
Yo, I don't have eyes on the scene.

32:01.916 --> 32:04.083
-I confirm it.
-Fucking douche.

32:04.166 --> 32:05.750
Piece of shit.

32:06.875 --> 32:08.583
That's it. Good talk.

32:09.458 --> 32:10.416
And the debt?

32:10.500 --> 32:13.000
Nando, let's forget that debt.

32:13.083 --> 32:16.708
You decide the best way to punish him.

32:16.791 --> 32:19.541
Sounds good, Peixe. Thanks, bro. Peace.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.416
-What now, man?
-What?

32:24.500 --> 32:27.083
Are you deaf? You choose his punishment.

32:27.958 --> 32:31.583
What's the punishment?
Tell us what it's gonna be.

32:31.666 --> 32:33.583
Say it, bro. Time is money.

32:36.625 --> 32:37.625
What will it be?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.750
I don't know, man. Do what you usually do.

33:00.333 --> 33:01.833
If you soak it…

33:03.416 --> 33:06.416
-When you soak it, it doesn't break.
-No, please!

33:12.750 --> 33:16.583
How could anyone do that
to a woman who just lost her husband?

33:19.666 --> 33:20.625
Enough talking.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.166
Your arms, legs, ribs.
I'll make an example out of you.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.250
Are you messing with my family?

33:34.625 --> 33:36.416
No one messes with them.

33:39.416 --> 33:40.333
No one.

33:46.166 --> 33:49.791
Next time you mess up,
it won't be a fucking stick, asshole.

33:50.875 --> 33:52.125
I'll fuck you up.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.208
Tread carefully, bitch.

33:59.333 --> 34:02.750
Yo, clown. Next time, you're done for.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.041
Shady fucker.

34:16.625 --> 34:20.000
Sorry. That must have been
a lifelong trauma.

34:20.625 --> 34:21.666
How are you?

34:24.791 --> 34:26.166
It's just another day.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.541
Well, I wanted to thank you for today.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.041
You're a nice guy, Levi.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.166
Thank you.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.750
Talk to you later. Bye.

34:59.416 --> 35:00.875
I had never seen that, Rita.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.375
It's a family thing.

35:04.166 --> 35:06.666
You went for his throat like a lioness.

35:07.666 --> 35:10.208
Ready to sacrifice yourself
for your auntie.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.166
God, I…

35:15.791 --> 35:17.541
I felt God's confirmation

35:19.083 --> 35:20.333
burning in my heart.

35:40.375 --> 35:42.791
Bro, I know your head must be buzzing,

35:42.875 --> 35:45.500
but now that you're famous,
you've become a target.

35:45.583 --> 35:48.250
I know, but I swear
I thought I had paid it off.

35:48.333 --> 35:51.125
With them, you either pay it or you don't.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.041
-There's no middle ground.
-Yes.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.625
I didn't want to get you involved.

35:56.125 --> 35:57.500
Be smart, man.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.916
Do you know how I'm still here?

36:00.416 --> 36:03.416
Keeping my eyes peeled,
always protecting my people.

36:03.916 --> 36:05.416
That's why I need you.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.583
You gotta protect yourself.
Only you can do that.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.958
Thanks for coming anyway.

36:13.041 --> 36:15.000
Man, I'd take a bullet for you.

36:16.291 --> 36:19.000
You're lucky I'm on good terms with them.

36:20.291 --> 36:21.875
I won't be here forever.

36:22.541 --> 36:24.458
That's crazy talk, Nando.

36:24.541 --> 36:25.625
I've got my plans.

36:26.708 --> 36:28.500
I'm not gonna do this forever.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.000
I'm gonna be a daddy again.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.250
-Really, bro?
-Yeah.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.916
Cool! We're on the same wavelength.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.375
-We're family.
-I love you, bro.

36:45.791 --> 36:51.416

I got one million views.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.125
Congratulations, honey.

37:18.625 --> 37:20.250
One million is nothing.

37:28.625 --> 37:29.750
I love you, Mom.

37:31.083 --> 37:35.750
Have faith in your path
Focus on your progress

37:35.833 --> 37:39.958
Let God take care of misunderstandings
Sow kindness to reap kindness

37:40.041 --> 37:44.166
We used to have nothing
Now we do and have it delivered

37:44.250 --> 37:48.208
Black B-King, moon comet
We'll take 24k

37:48.291 --> 37:50.125
Rid me of all evil

37:50.208 --> 37:51.958
SCHEYLA

37:52.041 --> 37:54.208
Bruninha misses her daddy.

37:54.291 --> 37:57.875
Daddy, are you coming home? I miss you!

38:01.666 --> 38:04.500
Hey, baby! Are you still up, honey?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
I KNOW WHO THE RAT IS

38:10.083 --> 38:11.333
Daddy loves you.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.666
I won't be long.
