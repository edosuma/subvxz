01:34.940 --> 01:36.483
You can move the red five up.

01:36.651 --> 01:38.904
Oh, yeah.

01:39.070 --> 01:40.737
Thank you, sir.

01:42.115 --> 01:44.326
Why do the cards have holes in them?

01:44.493 --> 01:46.077
Oh, they're....

01:46.244 --> 01:48.580
these are used cards from the casino.

01:48.762 --> 01:51.348
Once the casino pulls a deck
of cards out of action...

01:51.500 --> 01:54.628
they drill a hole through them
and sell them to the public.

01:54.794 --> 01:58.048
- Just a buck or two.
- Huh.

01:58.256 --> 01:59.925
Look at that.

02:01.259 --> 02:04.387
I suppose that's to prevent
people from cheating with them.

02:04.554 --> 02:06.056
Yeah.

02:06.515 --> 02:08.157
Makes for a good souvenir.

02:08.183 --> 02:10.685
- These are from Caesars.
- Hm?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.164
I've never been.

02:20.070 --> 02:21.655
Getting dark.

02:23.490 --> 02:26.801
I hate to say it, but I think it
might be time to kill the lights.

02:26.826 --> 02:29.120
Oh, yes, sir. Of course.

02:31.164 --> 02:33.250
You sure I can't make you a cup of tea?

02:33.416 --> 02:35.418
I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

02:35.585 --> 02:37.254
All right, then.

04:14.201 --> 04:16.370
Just what I needed.

04:17.815 --> 04:19.985
Drink up, guys. Don't
need you falling asleep.

04:21.736 --> 04:23.363
Hey, you take care of that battery?

04:23.388 --> 04:26.032
Oh, yeah. It finally
shit the bed, but...

04:26.136 --> 04:28.827
we swapped it out a couple hours ago.

04:30.078 --> 04:31.805
Okay, how'd it go?

04:31.830 --> 04:33.248
No problem.

04:33.415 --> 04:36.918
- Anyone see you?
- No. Dead over there.

04:39.671 --> 04:41.047
All right.

04:41.256 --> 04:42.841
Stay awake.

12:30.811 --> 12:31.979
Hello?

12:32.146 --> 12:34.023
Oh, hey. Come on in.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.943
Hi. I'm Francesca Liddy.

12:35.968 --> 12:39.320
- I'm here for the interview.
- Oh. Jimmy McGill.

12:39.487 --> 12:41.964
Hey, are you running
early, or am I running late?

12:41.989 --> 12:43.758
No, sorry. I'm a little early.

12:43.783 --> 12:46.285
It's not a problem.
Never bad to be early...

12:46.452 --> 12:48.746
except in death and taxes, and...

12:48.913 --> 12:51.334
some other things.

12:51.359 --> 12:54.335
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

12:54.367 --> 12:56.661
Does that look straight to you?

12:57.370 --> 12:58.538
Uh....

12:59.664 --> 13:01.599
I think there... that side...

13:01.624 --> 13:04.460
I think you're a little crooked.

13:04.485 --> 13:06.528
The bottom of the "M" there.

13:09.507 --> 13:12.760
Yeah. A little crooked.

13:15.137 --> 13:17.431
So you're coming off of
seven years at the MVD?

13:17.598 --> 13:19.742
- I am, yeah.
- Here's a question.

13:19.767 --> 13:23.271
How come New Mexico doesn't call
it the DMV like every other state?

13:23.296 --> 13:25.716
Well, that's a great question.

13:25.741 --> 13:27.458
Just like in Arizona...

13:27.483 --> 13:30.837
the Motor Vehicles Division
is part of the DOT, a division.

13:30.862 --> 13:33.081
Whereas, in most other
states, the DMV...

13:33.106 --> 13:35.706
or Department of Motor
Vehicles is its own entity.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.707
So I don't know if that
answers the question,

13:38.732 --> 13:40.847
except to say that's
the government for you.

13:40.872 --> 13:44.792
You got that right. Well, I for
one, am not calling it the MVD.

13:44.817 --> 13:47.278
DMV all the way.

13:47.426 --> 13:50.053
What do you think you learned
the most working there?

13:50.262 --> 13:52.470
Patience. Diplomacy.

13:52.495 --> 13:55.057
You meet all sorts of people down there.

13:55.082 --> 13:57.355
And most are really
great, really friendly,

13:57.380 --> 13:59.900
but you encounter some who are upset...

13:59.925 --> 14:01.702
- ...belligerent.
- What about old folks?

14:01.727 --> 14:05.080
- You get your fair share of them?
- Oh, lots of elderly drivers.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.894
After 75, they need to
take their test again,

14:07.919 --> 14:10.160
so if they don't pass...
you have to explain to them

14:10.185 --> 14:12.855
why their license isn't being
renewed, which is hard for them.

14:12.863 --> 14:14.781
What do you say then? Do you ever...

14:14.782 --> 14:17.075
yell at them? I mean, geezers, right?

14:17.076 --> 14:19.034
How can you not?

14:19.870 --> 14:22.990
No, I would never. No.

14:23.332 --> 14:25.583
Nor should you. That
was a trick question.

14:25.584 --> 14:27.940
You passed with flying
colors. Very good.

14:27.965 --> 14:30.046
Heh, okay. Well, then...

14:30.047 --> 14:33.049
so Jimmy and I have
very different needs.

14:33.050 --> 14:37.220
His practice is mostly
wills for senior citizens...

14:37.221 --> 14:40.765
while I'm focused on a single
client at the moment, Mesa Verde...

14:40.766 --> 14:43.810
with banking regulations that
generate a ton of paperwork.

14:43.811 --> 14:47.306
So I'm looking for someone
with an eye for organization...

14:47.314 --> 14:49.482
- ...and detail.
- Well, DMV's great for that.

14:49.483 --> 14:51.609
Tons of detail in
those driver's licenses.

14:51.610 --> 14:53.611
We did see hundreds of people every day.

14:53.612 --> 14:56.865
And you'd never want to let a
mistake slip through on their forms.

14:56.866 --> 14:59.037
You'd have a horrible
cascade of problems.

14:59.062 --> 15:01.035
Sounds challenging.

15:01.036 --> 15:03.489
So why the law?

15:03.497 --> 15:06.332
I mean, why leave the DMV or MVD?

15:06.357 --> 15:09.650
I have to imagine you'll be
giving up a good benefits package.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.427
Good health care and
retirement plans, but...

15:12.428 --> 15:15.430
there's a bureaucracy to
government work, that...

15:15.431 --> 15:18.141
ultimately became too frustrating.

15:18.142 --> 15:20.560
I guess what you'd call
it, too much red tape.

15:20.561 --> 15:23.105
I just wanna be somewhere
I can make a difference.

15:23.106 --> 15:25.521
Well, that's us. We're all
about making a difference.

15:25.546 --> 15:28.396
And I see here both Word and
Excel, you're comfortable with?

15:28.427 --> 15:30.136
- Absolutely.
- Excel and Word, wow!

15:30.137 --> 15:32.222
Well, you had me at old people.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.661
Hey, here's a question.
Can you start today?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.833
- I....
- Can...

15:36.997 --> 15:38.107
Yes?

15:38.132 --> 15:39.538
- Fantastic.
- No, can you...

15:39.563 --> 15:42.315
can you just give us
a second, Francesca?

15:42.316 --> 15:46.187
Absolutely. I.... Of course. Um....

15:46.195 --> 15:48.647
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.995
What are you doing?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.579
What? I like her.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.332
"Can you start today?"

15:58.357 --> 15:59.916
Don't you think we should
see more résumés...

15:59.917 --> 16:01.167
like, a lot more?

16:01.168 --> 16:03.378
She is our first interview.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.983
- We haven't checked her references.
- So we'll check them.

16:06.008 --> 16:09.217
Kim, you've been taking forever
searching for a paralegal.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.011
- We need help here.
- Haven't found the right fit.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.305
Yeah, because you're
searching for perfection...

16:13.306 --> 16:15.716
and perfection is the
enemy of perfectly adequate.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.393
- That's the bar? Adequate?
- She's more than adequate.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.803
She worked at the DMV.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.699
That's like the fifth circle of hell.

16:21.724 --> 16:24.649
Look, she's overqualified.
If it doesn't work out...

16:24.650 --> 16:26.568
we can fire her. It's no big deal.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.597
Don't you think someone with actual
legal experience would be better?

16:29.622 --> 16:32.907
Look, I've got a commercial
airing in 11 minutes...

16:32.908 --> 16:35.493
so the phones are gonna be ringing
off the hook. And I need help.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.662
Can we give her a test run, please?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.657
I got a good feeling about this.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.244
Come on, Kim.

16:47.873 --> 16:50.875
Now, getting these oldsters to
call, that's half the battle, so...

16:50.877 --> 16:53.681
- they need to hear a friendly voice.
- Friendly? Absolutely.

16:53.706 --> 16:55.595
Speak loudly and clearly...

16:55.620 --> 16:57.994
but be careful with the loud and clear

16:58.019 --> 17:00.244
because it can come off as angry.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.644
Be folksy.

17:01.669 --> 17:04.079
- Put a little sunshine in your voice.
- Got it.

17:04.105 --> 17:05.487
Okay. You need coffee or water?

17:05.512 --> 17:07.150
You need to hit the
head before things...

17:07.175 --> 17:09.970
Oh. There it goes. Heh.

17:11.689 --> 17:14.532
Offices of Jimmy McGill.
How may I help you?

17:14.558 --> 17:17.727
I'm sorry. May I put you on hold?

17:17.868 --> 17:19.290
Thank you.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.564
Offices of Jimmy McGill. Please hold.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.326
Sorry about that.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.392
What can I do for you?

17:28.296 --> 17:31.205
Uh.... that's right.

17:31.966 --> 17:34.093
Jimmy McGill from the commercial.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.650
Would you like to come
in for a consultation?

17:37.097 --> 17:38.900
Folksy. Be folksy.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.408
Say, is that a dog I'm hearing?

17:42.894 --> 17:46.438
It is? Aw. What's her name?

17:46.439 --> 17:49.657
Yeah, Cracker Barrel. It always
helps to mention Cracker Barrel.

17:49.682 --> 17:52.627
Well, I think it's great
you let Margaret play inside.

17:52.652 --> 17:54.269
It's a hot one out there.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.135
I was thinking of
going to Cracker Barrel

17:56.160 --> 17:59.103
because they've got
great air-conditioning.

18:00.109 --> 18:03.153
Well, yes, I love their biscuits too.

18:03.154 --> 18:06.149
Well, that's wonderful. Mm-hm.

18:06.174 --> 18:08.861
Yes, I think a will is really important.

18:09.322 --> 18:12.579
When would you like to
come in and meet Mr. McGill?

18:12.580 --> 18:14.490
"Jimmy." Jimmy.

18:14.499 --> 18:15.611
Always Jimmy.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.339
Uh, this Friday is open.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.742
Yes. Jimmy has a 9:00
free. Will that work?

18:22.257 --> 18:24.755
Fantastic. Can you
spell your name for me?

18:26.537 --> 18:29.224
And a number we can reach you at?

18:34.712 --> 18:38.065
Okay, Dorothy. Look
forward to seeing you.

18:38.090 --> 18:39.466
You betcha.

18:39.467 --> 18:40.805
Bye, now.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.047
I am so sorry. Thank you for
holding. How may I help you?

18:45.871 --> 18:48.247
Well, I can set you
up with an appointment.

18:48.272 --> 18:50.883
Jimmy is busy at the
moment, but if you'd like...

18:52.897 --> 18:54.564
You sound like you're outdoors.

18:54.589 --> 18:57.797
Are you staying out of the
sun? It's a hot one today.

18:58.527 --> 19:02.113
I'm sorry, but Jimmy is
unavailable at the moment.

19:02.114 --> 19:04.470
If you'd like to leave a message, Mr...

19:04.495 --> 19:06.625
Ehrmantraut?

19:07.703 --> 19:09.905
"Trout," like the fish?

19:10.748 --> 19:14.977
Uh, I hear Cracker Barrel
has excellent air...

19:16.086 --> 19:18.497
This one don't wanna
talk about Cracker Barrel.

19:18.506 --> 19:20.532
Yeah, patch that one through.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.025
Mr. McGill will take your call.

19:27.848 --> 19:30.683
- Hey.
- Your new assistant's a real pip.

19:30.684 --> 19:33.384
Yeah, thanks for crushing
her spirit on the first day.

19:34.230 --> 19:36.525
Thank you, sir. You drive safe.

19:38.150 --> 19:39.859
You the only one on this line?

19:39.860 --> 19:42.445
Yeah, only me. What's up?

19:42.446 --> 19:44.872
You free for breakfast tomorrow?

19:53.675 --> 19:56.218
All right. This is what you're gonna do.

19:56.219 --> 19:57.542
You're gonna go inside,

19:57.567 --> 20:01.056
buy a cup of coffee, a meal,
whatever, and sit in a booth.

20:01.057 --> 20:03.267
Sometime in the next 10 to 15 minutes...

20:03.268 --> 20:07.521
a guy in an old green Chevy Blazer
is gonna pull into that parking lot.

20:07.522 --> 20:10.357
He'll take a knapsack,
and he'll go inside.

20:10.358 --> 20:12.651
I need you to keep an
eye on the knapsack.

20:12.652 --> 20:14.486
Let me know what he does with it.

20:14.487 --> 20:15.964
Does he take anything out of it?

20:15.989 --> 20:18.574
Does he switch the bag with someone?

20:18.575 --> 20:20.951
Does he leave something
from the bag inside?

20:20.952 --> 20:23.078
Right, right, right. I got it.

20:23.079 --> 20:25.039
Green Chevy Blazer, black top.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.729
Yeah, what's in the bag?

20:27.334 --> 20:28.834
Is it money?

20:28.835 --> 20:30.455
It's gotta be money.

20:30.558 --> 20:32.475
Drugs? Is it drugs?

20:32.500 --> 20:36.276
Something else? Well,
um, I'm guessing money.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.745
- Tell me I'm right.
- He is gonna be here any minute.

20:38.776 --> 20:40.610
Now, I need you inside.

20:40.611 --> 20:42.529
You gonna do the job or not?

20:42.530 --> 20:44.606
Fine. I'll do the job.

20:45.282 --> 20:47.125
You charmed me into it.

21:06.011 --> 21:08.691
Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

21:08.716 --> 21:12.660
Uh, I'll have a Pollos
Classic and a coffee, black.

21:12.685 --> 21:15.103
Would you like the pollos
bonus size for 50 cents more?

21:15.104 --> 21:16.688
No. Normal.

21:16.689 --> 21:18.273
Dining in or to go?

21:18.274 --> 21:19.649
Dining in.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.693
- Will that be all today?
- Uh, yeah.

21:21.694 --> 21:23.693
Your total's $3.19.

21:25.864 --> 21:27.396
Thank you.

21:28.409 --> 21:31.592
- Do you want any extra salsa?
- No. Ketchup.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.525
One eighty-one.

21:45.092 --> 21:47.010
Hi. What can I do for you?

21:47.011 --> 21:49.804
Can I get a number four, please?

21:49.805 --> 21:51.632
Yes, sir.

21:51.890 --> 21:54.218
- Here you go, sir.
- Oh.

21:54.226 --> 21:56.978
- Have a great day.
- Yeah. You too.

21:56.979 --> 21:59.507
Yeah, I'll just take a diet.

22:06.238 --> 22:08.571
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

22:09.033 --> 22:10.626
What can I do for you?

22:10.881 --> 22:13.384
Can I get a number four, please?

22:13.784 --> 22:15.243
Yes, sir.

22:15.831 --> 22:18.938
- Is that for here or to go?
- It's for here.

22:25.424 --> 22:26.852
Classic.

22:30.596 --> 22:32.431
Sure, if there's one open.

22:32.890 --> 22:34.330
Oh, yeah.

22:35.184 --> 22:36.736
Yeah. Thank you.

22:39.563 --> 22:42.349
Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

22:55.579 --> 22:58.448
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. May I take your order?

23:09.051 --> 23:11.978
- Will that be all today?
- Is that for here or to go?

23:12.388 --> 23:14.172
Thank you. Have a great day.

23:23.424 --> 23:26.029
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:33.534 --> 23:36.536
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos
Hermanos. Can I take your order?

23:36.537 --> 23:39.740
Give me a number
three. Potatoes, coffee.

23:40.416 --> 23:42.750
Would you like the pollos
bonus size for 50 cents more?

23:42.751 --> 23:44.995
- No.
- Dining in or to go?

23:45.164 --> 23:46.664
In.

23:46.689 --> 23:47.936
Will that be all?

23:47.961 --> 23:49.108
- Four eighty-nine.
- Yeah.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.304
When you get behind the eight ball....

23:50.328 --> 23:52.193
Sure. You're right.

23:53.345 --> 23:55.584
Yeah, no problem.

23:56.069 --> 23:59.014
- Do you need any extra salsa?
- Yeah. Give me that.

24:11.071 --> 24:13.044
Here's a number three.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.602
Here you go. Have a great day.

24:28.505 --> 24:30.960
Manuel, where's my 22?

24:31.842 --> 24:33.616
Coming up.

25:13.167 --> 25:14.795
Pick it up.

25:16.345 --> 25:18.295
Thank you for coming
to Los Pollos Hermanos.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.607
Have a great day now.

25:33.779 --> 25:35.689
Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.

26:41.096 --> 26:43.135
You ready or are you still looking?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.266
Sorry. I'm still trying to decide.

26:45.267 --> 26:47.337
Okay, just let me know when.

27:24.014 --> 27:25.849
Can I help you?

27:28.461 --> 27:29.703
Uh....

27:29.728 --> 27:33.397
my watch, uh, clasp is loose. It...

27:33.398 --> 27:35.804
falls. I tried to reach it. Heh.

27:35.829 --> 27:38.027
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

27:38.028 --> 27:39.288
Allow me.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.785
You know, they say a nice watch
band is as important as the watch.

27:45.786 --> 27:48.030
That's what I get for cheaping out.

27:49.081 --> 27:50.624
We'll find it for you.

27:54.294 --> 27:55.711
Where the heck is it?

27:55.712 --> 27:58.748
Oh, don't worry. If
it's in here, I'll... Ah.

27:59.299 --> 28:00.880
There it is.

28:03.345 --> 28:05.805
May I clean this for you?
We have alcohol wipes.

28:05.806 --> 28:08.224
No, it's been in worse places.

28:08.225 --> 28:10.601
Thank you. That was very nice of you.

28:10.602 --> 28:12.935
No problem. It's my pleasure.

28:13.146 --> 28:14.733
Is there anything else I can do for you?

28:14.757 --> 28:16.294
Uh.... no.

28:16.692 --> 28:17.983
Thanks.

28:17.984 --> 28:19.583
You take care.

28:22.114 --> 28:23.739
- Tell me again.
- Jesus.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.473
How many different ways
you want me to say it?

28:25.497 --> 28:27.480
Just tell me what you saw.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.779
He came in, like you said he would.

28:29.788 --> 28:33.980
He ordered the number three
with potatoes and coffee...

28:34.209 --> 28:36.077
went bold with the extra salsa...

28:36.086 --> 28:39.527
and he paid cash out of
his left front pocket.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.027
Took his tray of food,

28:41.052 --> 28:43.610
sat in a booth on the east
side of the restaurant...

28:43.635 --> 28:45.418
and put the knapsack on the floor.

28:45.443 --> 28:46.637
Where on the floor?

28:46.638 --> 28:49.199
Under his seat, between his legs.

28:49.224 --> 28:51.347
Nobody touched it.

28:51.643 --> 28:55.146
He didn't talk to anybody. He
didn't even look at anybody.

28:55.147 --> 28:57.801
Finished his meal in five
minutes tops, and skedaddled.

28:57.826 --> 28:59.650
Didn't leave anything behind.

28:59.651 --> 29:03.696
- And you're sure of that?
- I literally checked the trash can.

29:03.697 --> 29:06.339
There was nothing in there but trash.

29:08.827 --> 29:10.327
So...

29:10.328 --> 29:12.538
what's our next move, huh?

29:12.563 --> 29:14.474
Are we gonna follow this guy?

29:14.499 --> 29:18.753
Because you... you got some
real James Bond stuff in here.

29:18.754 --> 29:21.005
This car doesn't have
an ejector seat, does it?

29:21.006 --> 29:23.326
I think we're done for today.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.865
- That's it?
- That's it.

29:27.929 --> 29:30.201
I mean, I cleared my morning.

29:30.849 --> 29:33.357
What, we're not gonna do, like...

29:33.935 --> 29:35.978
tail him to a new location?

29:35.979 --> 29:38.515
Or, I mean, we gotta sit
on him, at least, I...

29:38.672 --> 29:40.967
Thanks for your time.

29:50.368 --> 29:51.619
Hey.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.945
Who's got your back, huh?

29:54.581 --> 29:56.680
Me. That's who.

29:59.795 --> 30:01.981
I'll keep that in mind.

32:12.492 --> 32:14.443
♪ When the beef is on I killed her ♪

32:14.476 --> 32:16.594
♪ Heat so warm in the pistol's pocket ♪

32:16.603 --> 32:18.680
♪ If we got you in our sight.... ♪

32:58.769 --> 33:01.441
Oh, Kim, the conference call
with the Arizona regulator...

33:01.466 --> 33:03.731
needs to be rescheduled. Thursday okay?

33:03.732 --> 33:05.581
- Oh, yeah. That's fine.
- Okay.

33:06.819 --> 33:10.363
Francesca, have we got any more
of those dietetic butter cookies?

33:10.364 --> 33:12.240
- I can check.
- Thanks.

33:12.241 --> 33:13.956
Welcome, folks.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.489
Hey, Ernie. What's up?

33:32.094 --> 33:34.535
Can't you just come inside?

33:48.902 --> 33:50.243
Sorry.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.220
Thanks.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.283
What are we doing out here?

33:55.682 --> 33:58.759
I didn't wanna call you because
then it would leave a phone record.

34:00.122 --> 34:01.664
I was gonna come in, but...

34:01.689 --> 34:04.292
then I thought maybe
Jimmy shouldn't see me.

34:04.293 --> 34:06.781
- So...
- But you just called me.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.455
Oh.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.507
Guess I screwed up already.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.719
Ernie, screwed what up? Why
don't you want to see Jimmy?

34:15.012 --> 34:17.484
Well, it's just....

34:18.891 --> 34:20.547
I'm not sure how to start.

34:20.572 --> 34:22.812
You can start by just telling me.

34:24.367 --> 34:25.855
Here's the thing.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.858
I have some information, but
I don't wanna get in trouble.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.775
Trouble with Jimmy?

34:30.777 --> 34:31.944
No.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.313
HHM.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.908
I think I'm bound by
confidentiality, maybe?

34:36.909 --> 34:39.702
I'm a little hazy on the legal points...

34:39.703 --> 34:43.915
but if I tell you what I
heard and not Jimmy directly...

34:43.916 --> 34:45.742
like....

34:45.751 --> 34:47.335
like we have a buffer...

34:47.335 --> 34:50.295
- ...then legally, I'm safe?
- Ernie.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.656
What the hell are you talking about?

34:53.425 --> 34:56.378
I'm... I'm just worried about Jimmy.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.630
But if I tell him...

34:59.257 --> 35:01.709
I don't wanna get in trouble too.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.101
Tell Jimmy what?

35:07.605 --> 35:10.329
Lily, I wanna thank you
for bringing your mom down.

35:10.354 --> 35:12.776
It was a delight to
meet you, young lady.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.069
Thank you, Jimmy.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.363
Tell your friends, even if
they already have a will...

35:16.364 --> 35:19.033
it's important to get it
updated, just like you did.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.368
- I'll tell them.
- Now, you remember Francesca.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.464
She'll take care of
you the rest of the way.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.872
All right, who's next?

35:24.873 --> 35:28.042
Mr. Witchell. Mr.
Witchell, come on down.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.502
You're the next contestant
on The Price is Right.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.212
Jimmy, can I have a moment?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.610
Excuse me, sir.

35:33.635 --> 35:34.910
Looks like everything is....

35:34.935 --> 35:37.354
Apologies, Mr. Witchell.
Just be a second, folks.

35:37.355 --> 35:38.645
Oh, my gosh. Have you guys had the soup

35:38.669 --> 35:40.748
over at Cracker Barrel today?

35:43.694 --> 35:45.034
What?

35:45.321 --> 35:46.613
What?

35:46.614 --> 35:49.339
Hey, come on. I got people out there.

35:49.742 --> 35:51.694
- Hello. I can't...
- Give me a dollar.

35:51.702 --> 35:53.662
- Give you a dollar?
- Hand me a dollar.

35:53.663 --> 35:55.034
- Come on.
- Okay.

35:56.499 --> 35:58.667
- All I got's a twenty.
- Fine. Whatever.

35:58.668 --> 36:00.126
All right.

36:00.127 --> 36:01.670
I'm your lawyer now.

36:01.671 --> 36:04.097
If anyone asks me what I
know, we have confidentiality.

36:04.122 --> 36:06.456
- Why do we need confidentiality?
- Jimmy...

36:06.481 --> 36:08.393
...what did you say to Chuck?

36:09.804 --> 36:11.380
Oh.

36:11.405 --> 36:13.030
Here it comes.

36:13.068 --> 36:15.263
Howard, right? Did Howard call?

36:15.288 --> 36:18.215
Relax. No. Let me explain, please.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.574
Please.

36:19.575 --> 36:22.118
Kim, let me set the stage for you, okay?

36:22.119 --> 36:23.953
When I went to Chuck's
place last week...

36:23.954 --> 36:26.661
it was like the inside of a
Jiffy Pop wrapper, all right?

36:26.686 --> 36:28.187
There was Mylar on the walls.

36:28.212 --> 36:30.838
There was Mylar on the
ceiling. The ceiling.

36:30.961 --> 36:32.873
He thought his brain wasn't working

36:32.898 --> 36:36.049
because of the Mesa
Verde event and so...

36:36.050 --> 36:38.426
I kind of told him that he was right...

36:38.427 --> 36:40.178
about everything.

36:40.179 --> 36:42.096
I had to. He... he...

36:42.097 --> 36:44.599
Kim, he was broken. He was a broken man.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.576
I couldn't leave him
in crazy town like that,

36:46.601 --> 36:49.285
so I told him just to
make him feel better.

36:49.310 --> 36:51.856
Doesn't matter what he says.
Doesn't matter who he tells.

36:51.857 --> 36:55.185
- Because it's my word against his.
- Jimmy, there's a tape.

36:56.487 --> 36:57.639
What?

36:57.664 --> 37:00.810
There is a tape recording
of you talking to Chuck.

37:01.992 --> 37:04.077
What do you mean? Who?

37:04.078 --> 37:06.572
Who... he... he taped me? How?

37:06.580 --> 37:07.872
I don't know how.

37:07.873 --> 37:09.707
He just did, okay?

37:09.708 --> 37:12.335
- Ernie told me.
- Ernie told you?

37:12.336 --> 37:14.115
He said Chuck has a
tape recorder wrapped

37:14.140 --> 37:16.297
in a space blanket in his desk drawer.

37:16.298 --> 37:17.936
Ernie was putting new
batteries in it, for Chuck...

37:17.960 --> 37:21.083
and the tape rolled for a
few seconds and he heard you.

37:21.220 --> 37:25.363
Your voice saying something
about switching 1261 to 1216.

37:25.388 --> 37:28.583
So clearly, it was this
confession of yours.

37:31.146 --> 37:32.907
He taped me?

37:44.410 --> 37:45.892
Yes, Jimmy.

37:50.499 --> 37:52.712
But I'm not sure what
he can do with it...

37:55.087 --> 37:56.942
legally, anyway.

37:58.924 --> 38:01.161
I'm gonna have to do some research.

38:02.052 --> 38:04.645
He made that tape for a reason...

38:04.670 --> 38:06.997
and we just have to figure out why.

38:13.981 --> 38:15.278
Jimmy?

38:17.711 --> 38:20.115
I gotta get back to it.

38:20.529 --> 38:22.321
The lobby's full of clients.

38:22.322 --> 38:23.521
Okay.

38:25.576 --> 38:27.240
We'll figure this out.

38:28.454 --> 38:30.045
Yeah. I know.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.509
Sorry for the delay, everyone.

38:34.534 --> 38:36.961
Mr. Witchell, thank
you for your patience.

38:36.962 --> 38:39.196
I see you brought paperwork.

38:41.714 --> 38:42.923
I gotta say...

38:42.947 --> 38:46.074
I would never have thought
to collect bottle caps.

38:46.076 --> 38:49.119
Oh, it's a wonderful hobby.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.914
What excites me is the hunt. Heh.

38:51.915 --> 38:53.916
I can imagine.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.791
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Tiller.

38:55.816 --> 38:57.753
Why, thank you, Jimmy.

38:57.754 --> 39:01.010
- All right, then. You drive safe.
- Oh, I do.

39:08.139 --> 39:11.475
Is that the last one, or we got
any stragglers coming through?

39:11.476 --> 39:12.898
Last one.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.668
Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.

39:16.693 --> 39:18.360
You were great today.

39:18.361 --> 39:19.862
You too.

39:19.863 --> 39:21.695
Those folks love you.

39:25.410 --> 39:26.864
Who doesn't?

39:34.336 --> 39:37.129
And that's U.S. v. McKeever?

39:37.130 --> 39:39.833
Right. No, it makes sense.

39:40.759 --> 39:42.153
You were a tremendous help, Professor.

39:42.177 --> 39:43.902
Thanks for finding the time.

39:46.374 --> 39:47.761
You too.

39:48.308 --> 39:49.550
Thanks again.

39:56.735 --> 39:58.645
Francesca, could you do me a favor?

39:58.699 --> 40:01.221
Can you go through the Mesa
Verde files, in my office...

40:01.246 --> 40:03.486
and pull all the ones
labeled "CRA evaluations"...

40:03.511 --> 40:04.528
and sort them by date?

40:04.553 --> 40:05.973
I need to make sure I
have the most recent.

40:05.997 --> 40:08.152
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

40:08.177 --> 40:10.394
- I'll join you in a minute.
- Okay.

40:13.463 --> 40:14.862
So...

40:15.465 --> 40:18.081
just got off the phone with
my old Crim-Pro professor.

40:18.106 --> 40:19.760
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

40:19.761 --> 40:20.970
Well, as we know...

40:20.971 --> 40:22.269
New Mexico is one-party consent,

40:22.294 --> 40:24.706
so Chuck had a right
to make the recording.

40:24.891 --> 40:28.553
But you went to him worried
for his mental health.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.856
You said the things you did to
make him feel better, which...

40:31.857 --> 40:35.026
mitigates the admission of
guilt, at the very least.

40:36.570 --> 40:38.696
We can poke holes in the custody...

40:38.697 --> 40:41.574
throw doubt the voice on
the tape is even yours.

40:41.575 --> 40:42.722
Even failing that,

40:42.747 --> 40:45.536
its probative value doesn't
outweigh how prejudicial it is.

40:45.537 --> 40:48.998
I think we can get the whole
thing bounced under 403.

40:48.999 --> 40:51.128
Probably get it excluded outright.

40:53.003 --> 40:54.721
So then...

40:55.589 --> 40:57.917
outside the courts, what can he do?

40:59.217 --> 41:01.807
Play the tape for Kevin at Mesa Verde?

41:02.262 --> 41:05.347
He hasn't up to now. I'd have
heard something, for sure.

41:05.348 --> 41:07.059
And you know what? I
don't think he's going to.

41:07.083 --> 41:09.393
I don't think Howard won't let
him near Mesa Verde with that tape.

41:09.394 --> 41:12.542
Howard knows it would
make HHM look terrible.

41:19.529 --> 41:22.565
If Chuck has a plan for this
tape, I don't know what it is.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.478
At this point, all we can
do is wait for his move,

41:25.503 --> 41:27.235
then act accordingly.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.500
All right, then.

41:34.669 --> 41:36.000
Thanks.

41:36.797 --> 41:38.102
Sure.

41:40.008 --> 41:42.301
Oh, hey, what do you think? Um....

41:42.302 --> 41:46.305
it's Etude in Blue
over Daydream Harvest.

41:46.306 --> 41:49.975
I wanted it to look like
morning over the Sandias.

41:49.976 --> 41:51.470
I like it. It looks nice.

41:51.495 --> 41:53.766
It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash?

41:54.314 --> 41:57.733
No. It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash.

41:57.734 --> 41:59.563
It's nice.

41:59.736 --> 42:01.187
Thanks.

42:07.118 --> 42:08.486
You okay?

42:11.665 --> 42:13.434
Kim, I'm good.

44:55.447 --> 44:56.998
Yeah.

46:13.393 --> 46:14.948
Oof!

46:53.939 --> 46:55.642
Howard, what are you doing here?

46:55.667 --> 46:57.233
Chuck, do you have a second?

46:57.234 --> 46:59.652
Did you... you parked
over on the next block?

46:59.653 --> 47:01.595
- Oh, yeah. Way over.
- Yeah.

47:01.620 --> 47:04.337
Uh, phone. Keys.

47:05.244 --> 47:07.306
Hey, you have to hide them.

47:19.985 --> 47:21.360
Everything okay, sir?

47:21.361 --> 47:22.945
Yes, thank you, David.

47:22.946 --> 47:25.065
- Give us a moment.
- Yes, sir.

47:27.617 --> 47:29.844
- What's up?
- Chuck...

47:30.662 --> 47:32.866
this has been going on
for eight days now...

47:32.891 --> 47:35.332
and really, no indication
that it's going to work.

47:35.333 --> 47:36.961
It will work.

47:37.127 --> 47:39.329
I think I've been very patient...

47:39.379 --> 47:43.531
but the cost of these
around-the-clock private investigators,

47:43.556 --> 47:46.055
is really starting to add up.

47:46.080 --> 47:48.762
Howard. This is our duty.

47:48.763 --> 47:50.806
As officers of the court...

47:50.807 --> 47:53.392
- we have an ethical obligation to...
- Yes.

47:53.393 --> 47:55.394
My brother broke the law.

47:55.395 --> 47:57.334
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

47:57.359 --> 47:59.398
I'm not talking about doing nothing.

47:59.399 --> 48:01.278
I just want to...

48:01.303 --> 48:03.068
free up our minds...

48:03.069 --> 48:06.708
and be open to alternate
strategies, please.

48:08.097 --> 48:09.765
Meet me halfway here.

48:13.163 --> 48:14.880
I suppose...

48:15.582 --> 48:19.369
I suppose we could limit the
investigators to just night-time hours.

48:19.377 --> 48:21.086
- Night-time.
- Yes.

48:21.087 --> 48:24.465
Jimmy will most likely break
in while he thinks I'm sleeping.

48:24.466 --> 48:26.771
I mean, I wouldn't
put anything past him.

48:26.796 --> 48:28.344
It just makes the most sense...

48:28.345 --> 48:30.554
he'll try to steal the tape
under cover of darkness.

48:30.555 --> 48:32.389
You really think he's going to do that?

48:32.390 --> 48:34.200
I do, indeed.

48:34.225 --> 48:36.052
How can you be so sure?

48:37.103 --> 48:38.721
Howard...

48:39.481 --> 48:41.513
I know my brother.

48:43.109 --> 48:44.602
Chuck!

48:45.904 --> 48:47.310
Chuck.

48:48.521 --> 48:50.435
Open the damn door, Chuck!

48:50.460 --> 48:53.269
Open the door, damn it. Open it. Chuck.

48:53.294 --> 48:55.235
- Jimmy, go away.
- Open the door! Open it now!

48:55.236 --> 48:57.310
- I'm not opening the door.
- I swear to God, Chuck.

48:57.365 --> 48:58.617
I am not op...

48:58.642 --> 49:00.302
Jimmy. Jimmy.

49:00.568 --> 49:01.860
You taped me?

49:01.861 --> 49:03.445
- You asshole.
- Jimmy.

49:03.446 --> 49:05.815
You pulled that
heartstrings con job on me?

49:05.824 --> 49:07.872
You piece of shit!

49:08.576 --> 49:10.748
"Oh, my brain used to work.

49:10.773 --> 49:12.538
"I'm sick. I don't know what to do."

49:12.539 --> 49:14.114
Asshole!

49:14.139 --> 49:16.130
No wonder Rebecca left you.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.685
What took her so long?

49:21.965 --> 49:23.489
There it is!

49:27.481 --> 49:29.989
Here we go. Here we go.

49:30.885 --> 49:32.474
Here we go.

49:39.274 --> 49:40.810
Is this it?

49:40.835 --> 49:44.341
Is this it? Is this it? Huh?

49:44.521 --> 49:47.349
For this, you destroyed our family?

49:47.407 --> 49:49.408
You happy now? For what?

49:49.409 --> 49:51.208
For nothing!

49:53.100 --> 49:55.239
Is that all there is, Chuck?

49:56.041 --> 49:57.420
It's all the... all there is?

49:57.445 --> 50:00.061
Or did you make copies? Huh, Chuck? Huh?

50:00.086 --> 50:03.414
You tell me, or I'll burn this
whole goddamn house to the ground.

50:03.423 --> 50:05.150
Jimmy. Jimmy.

50:05.175 --> 50:07.085
That's enough.

50:07.969 --> 50:09.833
You need to step away.

50:11.389 --> 50:12.587
Howard...

50:13.220 --> 50:15.728
you were a witness
to what happened here?

50:15.753 --> 50:17.186
I was.

50:17.187 --> 50:18.562
And you?

50:18.563 --> 50:20.235
I'm a witness.
