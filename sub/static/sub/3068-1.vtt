02:09.338 --> 02:11.090
Uncuff him.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.644
Back through there.

02:18.430 --> 02:22.104
No, no, no, leave
that. Back through.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.770
Come on. Come on.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.443
Arms up.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.287
Fine.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.552
In there, get your kit off.
Come out when you're ready.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.947
Arms up.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.111
Kit's clear.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.864
Feet.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.960
Down.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.850
Get up, son.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.521
Get dressed.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.899
Oi.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.239
Single cell, high risk.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.502
Step through.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.678
Upstairs.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.726
Prisoner home!

04:31.396 --> 04:33.113
Wait.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.988
Through you come.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.451
And wait.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.096
All right. Move it.

05:18.693 --> 05:22.363
One on, now, 111.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.241
Through you go.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.749
Wait.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.424
Keep it moving, fella.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.216
Keep it moving.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.808
Over here.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.441
Face the wall.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.995
In you get.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.914
Ah!

09:23.605 --> 09:25.482
Feeding.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.904
Feeding, fella.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.257
Bruv.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.933
Flame, double bubble, yeah?

09:57.722 --> 10:00.725
Sorry, brother. Ain't
got one spare.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.628
Move along. Move along.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.171
Come on, move.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.508
Quick as you can. Come on, move it.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.256
Come on.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.101
Come on, guys, stop wasting time.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.704
Jog, mate.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.743
102, Jago.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.828
Any time.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.121
- Yeah?
- Cell, fella.

11:04.122 --> 11:07.171
- Fucking 111, you fucking cunt.
- Move it.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.845
Cheers, Jago.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.645
Safe yeah, Jago.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.268
What's wrong with this kanga,
bruv? He's over-watching us.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.817
I know, I can feel his eyes
in the back of my head.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.052
Stupid fucking junkie slut she was.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.095
Stepped up, done right by her.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.394
Fair play, offing that geezer.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.362
Still, don't make you
nothing in here.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.023
You conduct yourself usual
like an ordinary con.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.234
No more performing, no dramas.

12:57.235 --> 13:02.206
Right? Get on yard
with the rest of them.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.873
The yard.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.555
Bruv, bust me a light
please, you got a lighter?

13:29.225 --> 13:31.068
Back on.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.480
In you go.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.345
Brother.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.016
That flame, yeah?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.947
Shit.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.543
Oh, fuck's sake. Don't
fucking die on me.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.707
Fuck.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.550
You must wait till I'm ready.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.510
Miss, no, no... Nasty
bang to the head, miss.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.553
He needs you.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.138
Right, I'm gonna go now,
everything's sweet.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.431
- Everything's cushy.
- Son?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.057
Guv, it was an accident. I swear.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.392
- Stay there.
- Look, he walked...

16:17.393 --> 16:19.186
I mean it, son, don't fucking move.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.566
Bang up!

16:24.567 --> 16:26.569
Get in your cells now!

16:27.570 --> 16:31.244
In your fucking cells.
Come on! Move!

16:33.743 --> 16:35.745
It's another kick off.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.103
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Ready, Mr. Haynes.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.776
Sorry, Mr. Haynes.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.078
- Baby oil.
- Get the sand.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.828
Entry team. D wing.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.047
- Here you go, lads.
- Cheers, mate.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.340
Come on then. Yes.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.263
Yes.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.731
Weapons down, stand
against the back wall.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.146
School him.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.648
- Yes!
- Go on!

17:50.444 --> 17:52.821
- Pin him against the wall!
- Come on then, piggy.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.490
- Yeah, come on, you fucking pig!
- Hold his legs.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.617
Hold his fucking legs!

17:57.618 --> 17:59.586
Hey, calm down!

17:59.662 --> 18:01.705
- Hold him steady!
- Too fucking greasy, the cunt!

18:01.706 --> 18:03.549
Get hold of him!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.297
You fucking...

18:09.255 --> 18:10.714
You fucking come any closer, mate,

18:10.715 --> 18:13.883
I'll fucking skewer this pig
like a fucking hog roast.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.510
Now, fuck off.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.679
Drop that fucking thing
and fuck off now.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.180
Sharpish!

18:19.181 --> 18:20.728
That's fucking right.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.975
You don't want to do that, son.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.774
- Shut up, Clive.
- Who's talking to you, cunt?

18:26.355 --> 18:29.190
I tell you what I do want,
guv, you listening?

18:29.191 --> 18:30.775
A helicopter,

18:30.776 --> 18:34.529
two packs of burn and some
chocolate digestives, please.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.379
It was a fucking accident, guv.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.872
I swear to you.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.046
- All right.
- You believe me, don't you?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.793
Yeah.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.887
Fuck off.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.104
In you go, lads.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.643
Fuck you! You fucking cunts.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.561
Take it easy, son.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.396
Oh, for fuck's sake.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.065
I fucking knew it.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.399
- Scum you lot are, fucking scum.
- Easy, son.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.567
Fuck off, you little cunt.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.411
Take it easy.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.323
Come on. Come on,
you little fucking...

19:18.324 --> 19:21.117
- This ain't fucking gentle, boys, is it?
- Shut it!

19:21.118 --> 19:24.329
Come on, you little fucking...

19:24.330 --> 19:25.538
Move!

19:25.539 --> 19:27.123
Steady, steady, steady.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.922
Yeah, come on, you little cunt!

19:31.170 --> 19:34.631
You're telling me, you catch a girl
sleeping with your friend, yeah?

19:34.632 --> 19:35.882
Who you going to be
more vexed with?

19:35.883 --> 19:37.967
- Your friend or your girl?
- But I expect that more from a chick.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.594
I expect that. You know
what I mean? But the boy...

19:39.595 --> 19:41.388
Nah, I ain't touching her.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.981
Come on.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.141
Easy, easy.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.393
Right, wait.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.687
Fuck's sake, why ain't you lot
banged up in your cells, eh?

19:48.688 --> 19:51.111
- Easy, easy.
- Keep his head down.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.280
Fuck.

19:58.572 --> 20:02.622
Easy, boys, easy. We don't want
anyone to get hurt now, do we?

20:02.952 --> 20:05.955
- Baton.
- No fucking way!

20:08.582 --> 20:10.083
Ah!

20:11.252 --> 20:13.504
Why don't we all go
back to our cells?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.937
Hurry up.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.769
Ow!

20:27.810 --> 20:29.687
You fucking looking at?

20:29.812 --> 20:32.064
He made a mistake, Des.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.233
Des.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.077
A mistake.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.576
Out.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.703
If I go, he's fucked.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.998
My responsibility to you

20:49.999 --> 20:52.667
as a non-operational member
of staff, Mr. Baumer,

20:52.668 --> 20:54.669
is to get you away
from this incident.

20:54.670 --> 20:59.425
And if you don't comply this second
you can surrender your keys.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.893
No!

21:15.691 --> 21:20.037
I'm going to ask you to
please let go of Officer...

21:20.529 --> 21:22.155
Johnson.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.865
Johnson.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.200
No!

21:25.201 --> 21:27.202
He hurts me, Don.
He's fucking gotta...

21:27.203 --> 21:28.795
Oi!

21:36.545 --> 21:38.342
We can do this.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.301
It's okay.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.638
Yeah?

21:51.227 --> 21:52.977
Stay back. Stay back.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.896
I've seen all of
you, I'm a witness.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.740
It's fine.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.902
You all right?

22:00.903 --> 22:02.780
Okay, come on.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.379
Give your name and number in here.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.458
Love. C-9-4-8-7-W-B.

22:15.459 --> 22:19.429
This way. Foxtrot, Sierra, Quebec,
fourteen. Come in, over?

22:19.755 --> 22:22.590
- Cuffs, please.
<i>- Quebec fourteen, sir.</i>

22:22.591 --> 22:24.926
Request Governor Cardew
to segregation. Over.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.427
<i>Received, Quebec fourteen.</i>

22:26.428 --> 22:27.470
Fourteen out.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.973
Foxtrot Sierra standing by.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.900
Thank you.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.302
Everything's under
control, Christine.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.970
There's been an incident
involving Mr. Love

23:08.971 --> 23:10.930
which has placed him at
extremely high degree of risk,

23:10.931 --> 23:13.516
which is why I brought it to
your immediate attention.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.310
I propose that he begins treatment

23:15.311 --> 23:18.021
for his violence as soon as
possible, in my... In my group.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.564
He's assaulted two of my officers

23:19.565 --> 23:21.900
shortly after knocking
another victim unconscious.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.402
You will not be rewarding
him with any kind of group.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.487
- He wants to engage.
- He's a control problem.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.864
He can be reached.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.834
Gentlemen, I think you'd
better come with me.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.497
So, who is he?

23:36.498 --> 23:38.166
Eric Love.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.626
He's starred up, ma'am.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.960
Nineteen.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.296
Transferred from Durham
YO this morning.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.265
And you were aware of this?

23:46.175 --> 23:48.177
It came to my attention, yes.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.511
I realize I'm new in post

23:50.512 --> 23:52.221
but you didn't think to tell
me about a young offender

23:52.222 --> 23:54.395
transferred two years premature?

23:54.475 --> 23:56.568
It was on my agenda.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.687
You mentioned risk. What risk?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.360
Staff.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.115
Sorry?

24:07.404 --> 24:09.497
The Governor wants to see you.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.496
If you comply with the regime,

24:16.664 --> 24:18.790
I'm prepared to offer you
a place back on the wing.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.709
And a special kind of therapy

24:21.710 --> 24:24.921
with Mr. Baumer, with whom
you co-operated upstairs.

24:24.922 --> 24:26.881
But one more incident of any kind

24:26.882 --> 24:29.555
that comes to my attention, you'll
be straight back down here.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.271
Just one problem.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.224
And you're going to
tell me what that is?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.817
I'm just saying.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.603
Say this therapy goes well

24:40.604 --> 24:43.698
and it changes my life
and I rehabilitate.

24:43.899 --> 24:48.069
And then you lay it on for the next geezer
and it works for him, and the next.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.320
And everything's sweet, yeah?

24:49.321 --> 24:52.323
Crime rates start to come down,
police have got less people to nick.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.409
Courts got less people to convict.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.880
Pretty soon, you're out of a job.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.047
Do you mind?

25:07.589 --> 25:08.840
I said do you mind, you fucking...

25:08.841 --> 25:09.924
Right. Get...

25:09.925 --> 25:11.759
Oh, what a fucking pussy.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.053
- Oh, just take him back.
- Come on.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.346
Fucking ungrateful cunts.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.432
I pay your fucking mortgages
and all, you know.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.185
Get out.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.728
Well, it doesn't appear
Mr. Love is too ready

25:21.729 --> 25:23.688
for therapeutic
intervention, does it?

25:23.689 --> 25:24.939
No, no, no, no, no.

25:24.940 --> 25:30.446
I think we should go with your
initial instinct, Christine

25:30.487 --> 25:34.617
and give Eric Love the one chance
that Oliver thinks he needs.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.285
But as you say, any non-compliance

25:37.286 --> 25:40.005
and he's off the group
and back down here.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.652
Erm, Mr. Love.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.154
Never talk to me again.

26:13.155 --> 26:16.579
It's one phone call, clean
head shot outside the gate.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.539
All right?

26:21.789 --> 26:24.041
Fucking do one!

26:52.236 --> 26:53.611
He went in yesterday, bruv.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.238
No, he didn't.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.864
Do you think we don't check?

26:56.865 --> 26:58.199
And don't call me bruv.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.534
Look, I swear to you, Nev.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.378
Get your people now.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.338
Yeah, but I ain't
got no tech, bruv.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.167
- Hello.
<i>- What's up, T?</i>

27:49.168 --> 27:51.836
Yeah, yeah I'm all right, babe. But
listen, where's the fucking gwap?

27:51.837 --> 27:53.588
<i>- I put it in.</i>
- Don't fucking lie to me, babe,

27:53.589 --> 27:55.256
- because I'm in a spot here...
<i>- I put it in yest...</i>

27:55.257 --> 27:58.727
All right, miss one
again, hurt you.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.614
Hey, Jinsy, how
you doing? You well?

28:21.617 --> 28:23.369
Hello, Selfy.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.664
You done something to
your hair? It's nice.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.543
What you done, you had a haircut?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.294
Just a bit of gel, mate, yeah.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.139
Oh, it's nice. It's nice.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.980
Next.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.650
- All right?
- Yeah. Done it.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.442
Good.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.112
Fucking monkey.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.165
Your youngster, what I've heard.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.085
No offense to family

29:13.502 --> 29:15.753
but the kid's causing unnecessary

29:15.754 --> 29:17.838
to the good order and
discipline of this jail.

29:17.839 --> 29:22.640
And lock downs, as you
well know, cost me money.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.561
Slap?

29:25.013 --> 29:28.015
Stop being a psychopath
for a second, please.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.895
No. You exercise the
gray matter, Neville.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.481
You mentor him.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.899
You stick him on a path

29:36.900 --> 29:39.318
and you dedicate yourself
for a period of time.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.821
Save me a lot of aggravation.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.662
Least of all,

29:45.701 --> 29:49.375
having to murder the cunt
if sanity do not prevail.

29:51.164 --> 29:53.257
Get Selfy take you down there.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.554
Oi, Jim!

30:06.638 --> 30:08.640
Fucking hell.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.396
Yeah, see you later.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.565
I'm gonna tell you
something, all right?

30:59.566 --> 31:03.319
This here is not no young
offenders turn out, all right?

31:03.320 --> 31:07.615
They will fucking
dangle you, the kangas.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.289
They'll make it look like suicide.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.580
Right?

31:13.830 --> 31:17.458
Now, me, I can never leave.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.553
Top someone in jail,
they do not like it.

31:20.921 --> 31:24.882
But you, just do what
they want you to do.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.635
Play their fucking
game and then bounce.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.969
I ain't going to no fucking...

31:28.970 --> 31:30.471
Yes, you fucking are, cunt!

31:30.472 --> 31:32.681
Don't you ever fucking
answer back to me again.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.401
You will do what
you're fucking told.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.813
You'll do what the man was offering

31:38.814 --> 31:41.487
and you will fucking behave.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.902
Yeah.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.904
Tomorrow you'll be
back up on the wing.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.952
Selfy will take care of it.

31:49.282 --> 31:51.329
Come to see you, you know?

31:53.870 --> 31:56.839
Start of your sentence,
the one you're doing now.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.338
Five years old I was
sat on your knee,

32:04.339 --> 32:07.638
listen to you and mum
slag each other off.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.388
Eat your food.

32:34.161 --> 32:38.791
Come on, Love. Let me get you out of
this shithole and back to your wing, eh.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.838
Go on.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.465
Oh.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.945
Go up the stairs.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.053
Flame.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.390
Double bubble.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.547
All of you better stop whatever
the fuck you're doing!

35:33.548 --> 35:35.846
Who's been in my fucking cell?

35:36.384 --> 35:37.968
Oi, answer me!

35:37.969 --> 35:39.887
Who's been in my fucking cell?

35:39.888 --> 35:44.350
I will fuck you up. Who's
been in my fucking cell? Oi!

35:44.351 --> 35:46.143
Who was in my fucking cell?

35:46.144 --> 35:49.521
Answer me, now! Who the
fuck was in my cell?

35:55.779 --> 35:57.576
Ah.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.136
Start free flow.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.268
Thanks, guv.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.612
All right, it's time for class.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.281
- Dunk him.
- Yeah.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.954
Hard.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.785
It don't come back to me.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.583
No. No.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.179
All right, tip-top.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.849
Spoke to him, he knows
he's to mind himself.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.818
Don't mug me off.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.062
Listen to what the teacher
has to say, all right?

37:12.063 --> 37:13.655
All right.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.488
Welcome.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.386
What's going on?

37:40.842 --> 37:43.310
Was here when you
done your thing, man.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.190
Burstow.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.603
Love.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.526
Yeah, we know that.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.859
Eh, this guy...

37:57.901 --> 38:00.824
He clamped down on
that fucking kanga.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.205
Yo, where you located?

38:03.364 --> 38:04.490
D1.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.210
D2 above you, ain't we?

38:07.494 --> 38:08.827
Should've gnawed 'em off.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.079
Nah, blood. Kid's
regulating the play.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.378
They ain't been trained
for that shit.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.793
Hey, kangas dish you
out any damage?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.085
Nah.

38:17.086 --> 38:20.635
Just so you know, it's
no smoking in the group.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.221
We'll have a break, you
can smoke by the window.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.440
But we're all ready to start now.

38:31.142 --> 38:34.737
So if you just put it
out, we can begin.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.154
As you been told by the gentleman.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.578
- You making a monkey out of me?
- Can you leave, please?

38:42.612 --> 38:45.740
- Beg your pardon?
- You can't just walk in like that.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.834
You'll get your snout back after.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.954
Problem is you got to come
down on him full throttle,

38:51.955 --> 38:54.248
else it won't register. Right?

38:54.249 --> 38:56.922
Now listen what the
gentleman has to say.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.429
All right, off you go then.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.715
You stay here.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.777
Who was that?

39:15.228 --> 39:17.150
Neville Love.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.690
Love. As in...

39:19.732 --> 39:21.529
Yeah.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.528
Jesus Christ!

39:24.529 --> 39:25.929
He's only trying to help, ain't he?

39:26.656 --> 39:27.990
Nah, it's mad, blood.

39:27.991 --> 39:31.665
Come in here, try tell a man
what to do in front of everyone.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.996
Listen to me you, you
fucking cunty bollocks.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.080
Forde!

39:35.081 --> 39:37.249
Listen, you keep fucking looking
at me like I'm some sort of cunt,

39:37.250 --> 39:38.917
Mr. Love had his
initial assessment.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.294
- He's done extremely well.
- I'll fucking pen you.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.254
I would be grateful if you could
escort him back to the wing.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.380
He fucking threatened me.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.555
Can I have my pen back,
please, Mr. Love?

39:49.345 --> 39:50.596
- Thank you.
- Where are you, fella?

39:50.597 --> 39:51.763
D1.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.223
All right, come on, let's go.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.896
Thanks very much.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.657
You two are on his wing, right?

40:10.658 --> 40:13.160
Would you do me a favor and
just keep a little eye on him?

40:13.161 --> 40:15.413
I mean, he's only a kid.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.172
Where were we?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.944
D-Wing association, unlock!

40:47.612 --> 40:49.409
Oh, sorry, love.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.371
Ten.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.415
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.875
- What you stopping for?
- Yo.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.423
Huh?

41:09.008 --> 41:10.676
What do you reckon?

41:10.677 --> 41:12.135
Do your thing, man.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.887
Fucking shit!

41:20.895 --> 41:22.817
Cunt. Fucker!

41:23.231 --> 41:24.773
Fuck off.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.657
You pussyhole.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.660
- Yo, yo, come here, come here, come here.
- No, no.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.495
- Fucking asshole.
- Listen, listen.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.080
You can fuck people up, yeah.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.040
Fucking defend yourself.
But it don't make no sense

41:42.041 --> 41:44.794
catching another fucking
case now, does it?

41:44.877 --> 41:46.629
Now relax.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.298
Fuck.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.727
What?

42:02.103 --> 42:04.697
Think you got some do-do
in your hair, bruv.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.194
Ah.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.527
Hey, how come you helped?

42:51.652 --> 42:54.371
- Said to look out for you, on the wing.
- Who?

42:54.405 --> 42:56.031
- Ol.
- Ol?

42:57.158 --> 42:58.875
He's half a kanga.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.580
What, you boys back him do you?

43:03.581 --> 43:06.500
Yeah, Ol's different, man.
He works alone.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.753
Don't never press the alarm.
Puts his body on the line.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.631
And he don't get paid.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.842
How many kangas you know like that?

43:16.677 --> 43:18.429
Yo, blood.

43:18.763 --> 43:21.186
Make sure you come
back to it, yeah.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.396
It's beneficial.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.528
You should have seen me before.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.407
Yeah, I'll, er, think about it.

43:31.359 --> 43:33.031
Later.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.872
Bang up, D-Wing!

43:51.295 --> 43:53.588
You going up and down
the landing for?

43:53.589 --> 43:56.342
Hmm? What's that about?

43:56.467 --> 43:58.093
You need anything, you come see me.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.219
No, no, it weren't like that.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.393
What the fuck was it like, then?

44:02.223 --> 44:03.265
Huh?

44:03.266 --> 44:04.933
Well, you told me to go in the
fucking group, didn't you?

44:04.934 --> 44:06.893
Yeah, I told you to go
in the fucking group.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.228
Fucking learn, boy.

44:08.229 --> 44:11.314
To slow down and get out,
but not to fraternize.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.399
What?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.277
You know what I mean.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.446
I think you fucking do.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.952
Huh?

44:33.379 --> 44:35.552
You didn't give him
a clump, did you?

44:37.008 --> 44:39.431
No, fucking didn't.

44:45.141 --> 44:46.266
Hmm.

44:46.267 --> 44:47.601
You're jealous, mate.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.399
Oh, fuck off.

44:49.812 --> 44:53.607
He's making links, without you,
with some serious geezers,

44:53.608 --> 44:55.442
and now you want to
go and fuck it up,

44:55.443 --> 44:57.695
because you fucking are, mate.

45:02.450 --> 45:05.160
Who the fuck you think
you are? Huh? Huh?

45:12.376 --> 45:14.298
Good boy.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.807
There you go.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.736
Selfy's got a stomach bug.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.454
Oh.

45:45.034 --> 45:47.002
Like the old days.

45:48.204 --> 45:50.832
Got to keep the show
on the road, Dennis.

47:02.153 --> 47:03.905
Ah.

47:05.031 --> 47:06.532
You look nice.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.168
- Really?
- Nah.

47:10.745 --> 47:11.870
Where you from?

47:11.871 --> 47:13.079
Oxfordshire.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.874
Ooh. What you doing here?

47:15.875 --> 47:18.251
Well, I was going to ask if you would
like to walk to group with me.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.254
No, I mean this shithole.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.056
Well, I feel at home here.

47:23.341 --> 47:26.936
So this is where you open up
to me and build trust, is it?

47:28.554 --> 47:30.271
Yeah.

47:33.184 --> 47:38.861
Look, I was, em, sent away when I
was very young to boarding school

47:38.939 --> 47:40.815
and when I got out the other end,

47:40.816 --> 47:43.526
I found it really hard to
manage in the outside world.

47:43.527 --> 47:45.153
Posh boy.

47:45.237 --> 47:46.404
Not really.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.281
Well, you don't get paid.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.742
I had some family money
after my granny died.

47:50.743 --> 47:53.746
So this is sort of like
a hobby for you, then?

47:54.121 --> 47:57.465
No. No, I need to be here.

47:59.627 --> 48:02.801
I got sent away when I
was young like you,

48:03.255 --> 48:05.428
I was put into care.

48:07.176 --> 48:11.897
Then, when I was 10,
I done a pedo in. Hmm.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.143
Sloshed him.

48:16.143 --> 48:20.443
Boiled water, sugar, boom.

48:23.818 --> 48:26.446
Kiddy fiddlers, man, strange.

48:28.531 --> 48:32.867
They want you to reassure them
that what they're doing is normal.

48:32.868 --> 48:35.587
Like they want you, the victim,

48:36.122 --> 48:38.590
to let them off the hook.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.586
They want to open up to you,

48:43.003 --> 48:45.130
build your trust.

48:47.341 --> 48:51.311
Now, the geezer's face,
I won't never forget.

48:53.097 --> 48:56.141
Melted, in his hands.

48:56.142 --> 48:59.436
I think maybe you've got the wrong
idea. Could I just come in and...

48:59.437 --> 49:01.646
So you can start
touching me up and all?

49:01.647 --> 49:04.115
No, you fucking wrong one.

49:04.650 --> 49:08.780
How many fucking sugars do you
take? You fucking nonce cunt.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.409
Why should I give a shit about you?

49:14.410 --> 49:16.369
'Cause I'm starred up, mate,
and very fucking violent

49:16.370 --> 49:17.704
and you want to make
a name for yourself,

49:17.705 --> 49:19.205
don't you, and your
fucking little group.

49:19.206 --> 49:20.582
I don't give a shit if
you're in my group or not.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.709
- Then why you fucking stood there, then?
- I don't fucking know.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.502
- Have a think, then, dickhead.
- I don't want to think.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.926
Right now, I want to
fucking hurt you.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.394
Yeah?

49:40.352 --> 49:41.944
Good.

49:43.230 --> 49:44.982
Now we're getting somewhere.

49:45.316 --> 49:46.988
Let's go.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.914
- Morning, guv.
- Morning.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.080
Good.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.253
Come on, laugh.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.694
Hi, everyone, sorry I'm late.

50:38.619 --> 50:40.587
Hey, why you run last time?

50:42.206 --> 50:43.957
Hey, he didn't run.

50:43.958 --> 50:46.668
He chose to hold it down
instead of becoming violent

50:46.669 --> 50:49.092
and took himself back to the wing.

50:49.296 --> 50:50.968
Whatever, man.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.300
- He ran.
- No.

50:53.551 --> 50:55.052
He made a choice.

50:55.928 --> 50:57.887
So why you sticking it on me for?

50:57.888 --> 51:01.642
Because you're pressurizing him
and I don't want him to kick off.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.518
You're defending him.

51:03.519 --> 51:05.236
And what's wrong with that?

51:05.896 --> 51:07.989
So why you getting involved?

51:11.652 --> 51:13.319
Why not leave it to
his fucking dad?

51:13.320 --> 51:15.196
Fuck you, you little mangy cunt!

51:15.197 --> 51:18.325
- Ryan, that was... That was wrong.
- Take it easy, man.

51:19.743 --> 51:22.579
Take it easy. Hey, hey,
take it easy man, chill.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.039
Chill, yeah? You're
doing the right thing.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.416
He knows.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.334
Fucking this guy don't give a fuck.

51:28.335 --> 51:30.086
You're mugging him
off by telling him.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.760
And you're doing what
by telling me, blood?

51:32.881 --> 51:34.549
- What you saying, blood?
- What the fuck you standing up?

51:34.550 --> 51:36.092
I'm saying what I'm
saying, ain't I?

51:36.093 --> 51:37.260
Des was offering support.

51:37.261 --> 51:38.386
I don't give a fuck what
he was saying about.

51:38.387 --> 51:39.512
And you shamed him
without meaning to.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.014
Yeah, but he's shaming me
and you ain't got shit

51:41.015 --> 51:42.515
to say about that, have
you, you stupid prick.

51:42.516 --> 51:44.601
- That's enough.
- Listen. Me?

51:44.602 --> 51:46.686
It's fucking him who's on
his fucking period, bruv.

51:46.687 --> 51:49.022
Stepping in. Mugging man off
like I was a fucking bag head

51:49.023 --> 51:50.815
scratching for dog-ends
on the fucking yard.

51:50.816 --> 51:53.359
When that ain't what this group is
meant to be about now, is it for?

51:53.360 --> 51:55.236
I'm standing up 'cause
I'm standing up. What?

51:55.237 --> 51:56.696
I'm standing up now, what?

51:56.697 --> 51:58.573
- The fuck you standing up for?
- Come make me sit down.

51:58.574 --> 51:59.866
- Come make me sit down.
- Fall back, man.

51:59.867 --> 52:02.410
Come. Hey, come here.
Blood, I'm standing up.

52:02.411 --> 52:03.536
Bruv, ain't shit going down, man.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.538
'Cause you would have lumped Des
and he would have shanked you,

52:05.539 --> 52:08.963
and that would have finished the
fucking group altogether, you cunt.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.340
So relax.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.111
Talking to me, bruv?

52:37.112 --> 52:38.780
- Enjoy your smoke, man.
- Now we say?

52:38.781 --> 52:40.533
Enjoy your smoke, man.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.409
- You still talking to me, bruv?
- Why don't you enjoy your smoke.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.254
- Fam, you still talking to me?
- Enjoy your smoke.

53:02.221 --> 53:05.019
I ain't never had a problem
with him, you know.

53:10.604 --> 53:12.105
You got a topic?

53:12.106 --> 53:13.823
Hmm?

53:13.982 --> 53:15.779
For the group discussion.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.616
No, I'm just listening, ain't I?

53:20.614 --> 53:22.457
- Fair enough.
- Hmm.

53:34.878 --> 53:38.507
It can take a session or
two to get used to it.

53:39.299 --> 53:42.769
Erm, okay, so who's got a topic?

53:46.849 --> 53:49.022
- Serious?
- Nah, mate.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.438
- Take it easy, yeah?
- Cool.

54:13.584 --> 54:14.834
Don't fucking touch me.

54:14.835 --> 54:16.919
Look, I told you, you get
the rest when you do him.

54:16.920 --> 54:19.548
- He's gone and done you.
- Yeah, I fucking did what you told me.

54:20.883 --> 54:22.341
- This guy's crazy.
- Just give it to me.

54:22.342 --> 54:24.469
- When you do him.
- All right.

54:47.701 --> 54:49.535
And how about your little
Warren and Charmaine?

54:49.536 --> 54:51.245
Yeah, doing well, a big boy.

54:51.246 --> 54:52.538
- Getting a big boy.
- Yeah.

54:52.539 --> 54:54.382
And what about Char...

54:56.001 --> 54:58.674
- Can I help you, young man?
- Nah, sweet.

55:03.342 --> 55:04.967
Hey, is he about?

55:04.968 --> 55:06.560
In a meeting.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.600
Eric, right?

55:12.851 --> 55:14.477
Come in.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.857
Thanks.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.575
It's all right.

55:25.239 --> 55:28.157
Come to talk to you. Man to man.

55:28.158 --> 55:31.244
So we don't get on each
other's fucking tits no more.

55:31.245 --> 55:33.088
Which is a good thing.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.050
All right.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.427
Talk.

55:44.883 --> 55:48.678
You just order me about
and tell me to do stuff.

55:48.679 --> 55:51.432
You don't give a fuck
about how I feel.

56:02.067 --> 56:03.864
Well, that's it.

56:04.278 --> 56:08.282
Fuck off, "That's it".
What else is going on?

56:09.157 --> 56:12.957
Come on, you come here to fucking
talk to me, tell me, what is it?

56:15.873 --> 56:18.421
Someone giving you a
fucking hard time?

56:20.669 --> 56:22.503
Someone fucking threatening you?

56:22.504 --> 56:25.798
Tell me the truth. What
the fuck is going on?

56:25.799 --> 56:29.894
Nev, I think he's just trying to
tell you something and he's...

56:38.645 --> 56:40.988
It's fucking prison, ain't it?

57:22.940 --> 57:26.859
As someone whose nan who come off
the fucking boat, Barbados, yeah.

57:26.860 --> 57:28.110
Don't like Africans.

57:28.111 --> 57:31.364
Think they can look at me with
all their fucking tribal scars,

57:31.365 --> 57:33.908
- mad accents and shit?
- I'm a fucking African.

57:33.909 --> 57:35.409
Yeah?

57:35.410 --> 57:38.037
But you ain't got no scars and
you talk South, you cunt.

57:38.038 --> 57:40.331
- They got their fraud.
- I'll give you that.

57:40.332 --> 57:43.255
Being honest, don't like
fucking black people.

57:43.418 --> 57:45.795
All in. They just
prey on each other.

57:45.879 --> 57:47.505
Don't let no one advance.

57:47.547 --> 57:50.758
Now you see your, your Indians,
your Bangladesh, your Vietnamese,

57:50.759 --> 57:53.761
your fucking Pakistani,
Koreans, North, South,

57:53.762 --> 57:55.513
whatever the fuck they
want to call themselves,

57:55.514 --> 57:57.473
now you see them, motherfuckers,
they stick together.

57:57.474 --> 57:58.933
Slavery done it.

57:58.934 --> 58:00.601
It was you African
nig-nogs that traded us

58:00.602 --> 58:02.228
to the white cunts to
start though, weren't it?

58:02.229 --> 58:04.447
Yeah, well, I don't like yids.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.607
- I'm a yid.
- Fuck off.

58:06.608 --> 58:08.192
- I'm half Jewish.
- Which side?

58:08.193 --> 58:09.568
- My father's.
- Don't count.

58:09.569 --> 58:10.861
You're off track
with the Jews, bro.

58:10.862 --> 58:12.279
Check it. They arrived
at the bottom,

58:12.280 --> 58:13.656
but finished at the top.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.199
One generation, wherever they are.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.409
I still ain't having them.

58:16.410 --> 58:18.457
Well, you're a black cunt.

58:21.206 --> 58:23.124
If I'm a yid cunt, you're a
black cunt, he's a white cunt.

58:23.125 --> 58:24.417
We're all a bunch of cunts
if you think about it.

58:24.418 --> 58:25.543
Yo, slow down, old man.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.461
You white cunts, you ain't
all that compared to us.

58:27.462 --> 58:29.839
- How?
- The chicks.

58:29.923 --> 58:31.090
We got the bigger knobs.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.553
Yeah, you lot don't go down on birds
though, do you? What fucking good's that?

58:35.554 --> 58:37.221
I make you wrong there, bruvva.

58:37.222 --> 58:38.723
Against the religion, acki.

58:38.724 --> 58:41.600
No, no, no. Listen, back door,
I ain't troubling that.

58:41.601 --> 58:44.445
Oral pleasure, permissible.

58:44.688 --> 58:47.862
Bruv, you ain't sucking pussy.

58:50.444 --> 58:53.322
You ain't fucking. That right, OI?

58:53.363 --> 58:55.406
Yeah, if I had a pussy to suck.

58:55.407 --> 58:57.008
And if that pussy was
attached to a woman

58:57.909 --> 59:00.036
with whom I had a loving
and trusting relationship,

59:00.037 --> 59:01.871
I would consider
myself very fortunate.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.669
Ty, you missing out, blood.

59:03.749 --> 59:05.967
I'm telling you,
it's a part of life.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.352
Maybe push the boat,
when I land, ain't it?

59:13.550 --> 59:15.968
I ain't saying for definite.
I ain't saying either way.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.766
How long you got?

59:23.143 --> 59:24.185
13 years.

59:25.937 --> 59:27.984
Fucking no rush then.

59:28.356 --> 59:30.449
Plenty of time to think.

59:32.819 --> 59:37.448
Still, you'll be getting balls
deep before me son, so...

59:37.449 --> 59:39.371
Full report, please.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:18.164
Yo.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.968
Jab. In the bottom.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.686
Double jab.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.851
Two, up two. Up two.

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:57.495
Hey, you don't expect me
to lift that, do you?

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.323
Nice.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:43.457
Yo, fuck them, man. I'll hold
your ankles for you, let's go.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:47.369
- Let's go, man.
- Nah, it's all right. Fuck it. Sweet.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.872
Allow him, Hass, he wants
to train like a bacon.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:55.671
Said you want to train like
a bacon, a fucking nonce.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.338
It's up to you.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.681
Big right.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.646

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.403
Left, right, uppercut,

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:16.315
Double jab.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.988
Cover that chin.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.445
Two.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.330
Four.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.202
Hook, hook.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:26.830
Drop your right and I'll tag you.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:28.619
Body, body.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.831
Uppercut, uppercut.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.376
What, you think you're Ali, bruv?

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:36.794
Calm yourself down.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.592
Four.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:40.214
Double jab.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.342
Arms up. Ain't gonna
tell you again.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.681
Jab hook, big right.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.679
Ahhh!

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.227
Oi!

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.521
You fucking seriously having that?

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:55.278

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.524
Two. Six.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.117
Six!

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.241
Six!

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.201
Ten!

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.828
Uppercut.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.201
Time. Who's next?

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.475
Cunt.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:40.817
Fucker. Fucking cunt.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.927
Who fucking sent you?

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.930
Who fucking sent you?

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.481
<i>You have to stop eating.</i>

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:22.483
<i>I eat because I'm depressed, right.</i>

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:23.984
<i>You're depressed,
what about me, huh?</i>

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.944
<i>What do you think it's like for me?</i>

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.072
<i>Mum, I'm the one in fucking prison.</i>

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.625
Sorry, Mum.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:33.707
Mum, look I don't want to
fucking argue about it.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:36.372
Mum, listen...

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:38.716
Look, I just want to
ask how you are...

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.342
Fuck!

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.306
Ahhh!

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.143
Fucking pussy hole.

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.479
Fucking want someone doing,
Jago, do them your fucking self.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.648
- I ain't got that kind of clout. Please.
- Who was it then, Jago?

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.401
- Who's the fucking man?
- Please, please, please.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.568
Was it that fucking old cunt

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.153
at the top of the stairs
with the fucking hair, him?

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:09.530
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about...

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.073
Lose your fucking lip
then, Jago cunt.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.658
It's him, chill, chill.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.002
That's him, yeah? Yeah?

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:48.026
Oh! Fucking get the...

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.820
Get the fuck down.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.488
You... Fuck me, you an' all?

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.449
Oi, I fucked him up, you know.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.367
- I cut him fucking good, mate.
- Who?

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:59.037
That fucking fat black bastard in the
fucking canteen, you fucking know who.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.289
- You cut him?
- Yeah.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.957
You fucking stuck him on me, mate.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.675
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.503
- Drop it. Drop it!
- Huh?

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.256
Drop it!

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:12.640
Jags... Jags, up here now.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.763
Well, let go of him then.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:19.813
Behave. Get up, get up, go on.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:30.494
- Yeah, there he is your fucking...
- Stay there!

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.159
You saying I put you on him?

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:36.284
Is that how it is?

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.707
Using my name?

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:45.042
He's not some punk. He's
Eric Love, Neville's own.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.838
Transfer or your life.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.512
Either way, you won't
be here tomorrow.

01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:56.266
You're getting blood on
my floor. Now fuck off.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.724
All right.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.062
Leave us, please.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:07.397
Don't agitate me.

01:07:07.398 --> 01:07:08.774
Dennis.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.618
He'll be fine.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.703
Neville.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:28.009
Sit down then.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.387
Am I right about you, Eric?

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:39.312
Starred up means you're a leader.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:46.146
Why you attack people for the
principle, instead of losing pride.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:50.320
And no leaders, where would we be?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.823
Back to the fucking Stone
Age, that's where.

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.664
Scratching our recta
without no toilet paper.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:58.999
Cunts.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.414
So...

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.712
Issues, Eric.

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:09.836
Bring 'em here and we can
resolve any matters arising.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:12.804
Know you can take care of yourself,

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:17.100
but it sometimes helps to
have friends with influence.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:22.060
Something you will learn.
You with me?

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:25.692
And no more silliness,
I want a nice quiet wing.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:29.776
You can go.

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:36.029
You remind me of myself,
when I was your age.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:06.517
All right.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.111
What's going on?

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.443
I'm sorry?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.899
You have to help him, you know.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:17.027
You have to teach him the answers,
the things he's supposed to say,

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.906
you know, like the
"Think Right" program.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.075
You know, help him get out.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.118
You know, like the, fucking,

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.703
"What would you do
if you were in a bar

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.247
"and a fella comes up and
starts talking to your bird?

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:31.249
"What you gonna do? Oh, I'm
gonna tell him politely

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.920
"that I'm with her, you know, rather than
glass the cunt." You know what I mean?

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.421
- Exactly. That bollocks.
- Okay.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.424
That's not what my group is about.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:42.219
Your son and I are on a journey
together and we will...

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.595
No, he needs to behave.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:46.807
Okay, he's suffered enormous
emotional trauma and abuse.

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.308
- Oh, I never touched him.
- Well, you weren't there.

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:51.437
I didn't... Okay, that's
enough, all right.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:55.695
Fucking finish.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:00.655
'Cause in case you haven't
fucking fully appreciated,

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:05.451
I am his fucking parent

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:08.291
and I am fucking here now.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.624
You think you can fucking
fix him up, huh?

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:16.753
What, you got a fucking couple of fucking
nice little letters after your name.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:18.972
Well I've got fucking numbers.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:21.930
So's he.

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:26.179
Do you have a family?
Have you got family?

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.557
You got someone you
go home to at night?

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:29.766
No?

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.565
Or would you rather be
doing fucking bang up?

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.312
Closed in with all the rest of us?

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:37.532
You sick fucking
no-life, saddo cunt.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:47.168
Maybe you don't feel comfortable
accepting help from other people?

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.455
Hmm?

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:54.758
I know I don't. Makes me
wonder what's in it for them.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:56.168
Laying yourself open.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.461
Vulnerable, ain't it?

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:58.920
- So why you do it then?
- What?

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.515
Lend me the fucking
shampoo, you mug.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:05.185
'Cause you had some fucking
shit in your hair.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.596
I said you had some
fucking shit in your hair

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.598
so I give you some fucking shampoo.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:12.851
Ain't put my hands on you,
ain't disrespected your mum.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.728
And, right about now,
the more I fucking flow,

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:17.481
and flow, and flow,
and fucking flow,

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:20.150
the more I know you ain't
gonna do fuck all.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.651
Pussy.

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.529
Stay with it.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:27.037
Stay with it, that's it.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.829
- I feel like a cunt.
- Good.

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.748
- Good?
- Yes, good.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.047
I feel like a cunt every day.

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.972
Stay with it,

01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.345
breathe with it.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.558
Breathe with it.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.491
Done well.

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:02.360
Yeah, it was good.

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:03.985
Straight.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.111
Yeah, it was all right.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.405
He's smiling, look at him,
he's smiling, he's smiling.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:08.824
He knows he's done well, go on.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:09.991
Yeah...

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:13.712
Anger management, control.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.620
Everything all right?

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.286
Fine.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:09.472
Sweet.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.108
Who's that then?

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:26.986
My mum.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.492
Why?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.661
No, I'm just saying.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.663
Nice photo, ain't it?

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.874
- How's yours?
- Hmm?

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.623
Your mum, must be a bit
worried about you?

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.501
No, I ain't got one.

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.713
Bang up!

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.429
Thanks.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.931
For what, blood?

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.729
For the tea, ain't it?

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.279
Come on, mate, it's
not the crown jewels.

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:07.802
What you do in that group?

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:11.264
Talk, ain't it?

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.683
- Talk?
- Yeah.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.766
And sometimes it can go.

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:19.894
Sounds loops.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:22.104
It is.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.318
- Okay, so, what's the topic?
- Jail.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:35.405
- Okay.
- Yeah, like what effects it has on you

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.323
and how it fucks with your head.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:40.618
- Good topic.
- You want jail, yeah, go fucking Morocco.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.621
Ain't got peeps,
money, you're fucked.

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:46.545
- American jails, worse. Don't care.
- Why's that?

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.501
They shag each other
out there, ain't it?

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:51.300
Bruv, I'd rather have no servery...

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.564
Welcome.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:27.749
Fuck me!

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.210
What's your fucking problem? I'm
fucking here cause of you, ain't I?

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:32.337
- Well, sit down then.
- Don't fucking embarrass me, all right?

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:35.307
Don't fucking embarrass
me in front of everyone.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:39.969
You want a fucking
straightener? Come on.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.763
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Fucking have it.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.515
- Mr. Love.
- Fucking have it then.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:44.974
Don't fucking start
with me, all right?

01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:48.728
With your poncey fucking voice and you
think you're fucking better than me.

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:50.814
Don't fucking start with me.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:54.159
Look, just sit down
and shut up, yeah.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.322
Fuck your class.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:03.203
You fucking, bunch of fucks!

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:06.663
Get me off this fucking wing!

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:10.041
Off the wing, now!

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:11.459
Bang me the fuck up!

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.712
All right, all right, fella.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.052
Fucking wankers.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:24.097
Get me off this fucking wing!

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:26.474
Open the fucking gate!

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.268
Open the fucking gate!

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:30.567

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:34.067

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:35.567

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:39.163
Open the fucking gate, get
me behind my cell, now.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.285
Think positive.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.075
- Rise above it.
- Ryan.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:45.201
I'm helping him.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.750
It's the wrong kind of help
right now. If you just back off.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.795
Yeah, you don't ever
bite, Ryan, do you?

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.917
Fucking everything sorted, is it?

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:54.502
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.671
- 100%.
- All times?

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:57.839
Like I said.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:00.133
Yeah, well maybe you ain't
fucking true to yourself then,

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.718
to the fucking group and all.

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:03.261
- Just watch your mouth.
- Watch me mouth?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.889
Go fuck your mum in her asshole,
how's that sound to you?

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:07.640
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Yeah, there we go.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:09.601
Who the fuck do you think you're
talking to, you little prick?

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:10.768
Take that back or I will
fuck you up right now.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:13.354
What, do you think I'm one of them
little fucking pricks on the wing?

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:14.772
- Fucking 100%.
- Carry on smiling.

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.024
You're gonna see
what's gonna happen.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.275
- Sit down.
- Fucking prick.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.776
You think you can just
fucking talk how you want.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:20.612
You can talk whatever the
fuck you want about my mum.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.155
Like a fucking dead person, I am.

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.823
I don't fucking feel anything.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.917
Nah, this is bullshit, man.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.374
No one don't say nothing
about no one's mum.

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.330
You've been fucking warned.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:31.748
And you too.

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:33.466
Hmm.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.723
Suck your mum.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.393
I will bury you!

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:55.271
I want him! I fucking want him!

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.661
I will bury you, cunt!

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:13.539
Step inside the fucking
ring, you pussy!

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.125
Look, look Ty. Lads, boys...

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.211
Listen, cause I ain't got fuck
all going on with my mum,

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:20.964
don't give me the right to
start slating yours, yeah.

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:22.717
I'm sorry.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.842
Okay?

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:27.846
Ryan, don't leave me hanging
like a cunt, come on.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.056
Yeah, look, sweet.

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:33.652
See, done, yeah?

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.524
Mr. Baumer, would you care to tell
me exactly what is going on in here?

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:40.733
I'm in the middle of a session.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:43.152
- You have a vulnerable YO in here.
- And?

01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:45.655
We agreed one incident and
he would have to leave.

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:47.865
- But he didn't do anything.
- You need to do it,

01:19:47.866 --> 01:19:50.039
and you need to do it now.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.876
You're going to have to go back to the
wing, just for this session, mate.

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:00.879
- Bullshit.
- Why?

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:04.340
It was agreed, one incident
and he has to come off.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:06.093
Yeah, but it's all right.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.058
Relax boys, fucking hell.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.806
- Sweet, Ryan, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:12.890
- Ol.
- Well done, yeah.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.100
- Cool, thanks man.
- I'll come and see you...

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:15.351
I'll come and see you later.

01:20:15.352 --> 01:20:16.728
- Okay.
- I don't think so.

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:19.857
- What?
- A break is a break.

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:21.899
He's lucky not to be
back on segregation,

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:25.119
which I recall formed part
of our original agreement.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.823
Why are you so scared of something
that might actually work?

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.074
You need to calm it down.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.492
He's building trust.

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:35.247
Okay, he's taking stuff on.
It is working.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.957
I mean, seriously, what
are we doing here,

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:40.460
if not trying to help prisoners
like Eric fucking Love?

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:43.004
What is it you don't understand?
He is a young offender.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.756
I don't give a fuck, I want him!

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.258
You, you need to get a hold
of yourself, Mr. Baumer,

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.761
because you are far too involved.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.885
Sorry about Love.

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:34.972
Of course, we did everything we could
to accommodate him in your group.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:37.646
But with someone like that, well...

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:43.482
However hard we try, sometimes
there's just no hope, is there?

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:46.943
Warehouse him.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.446
Protect the public that way,

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:54.158
make sure he stays inside
for the rest of his life...

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:16.123
Fucking no better than a
fucking grass, you're not.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.368
Fucking running your gums
in the fucking group.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:21.412
Slinging your tampon around,

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:24.916
until half the fucking jail come
on top. Embarrassing.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:28.377
Bummer, Baumer, whatever his fucking
name is, better man than you, mate.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:32.348
See that group makes you feel part
of something, like you is someone.

01:23:32.382 --> 01:23:35.931
Fucking come here, I thought
sweet, big man's nick.

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:38.054
I thought nice one,
someone to look up to.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.639
Fucking bollocks, joking ain't you?

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.266
- Nev.
- Eh?

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:44.268
Fucking walking around,
fucking giving it the large'un,

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:45.770
intimidating people.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.272
Yet you can't even sit
on your own fucking ass

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:50.107
for five fucking seconds.

01:23:50.108 --> 01:23:52.109
What's that about, eh?

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:56.364
Fucking embarrassing, that's
what that is, fucking pathetic.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.200
Tell you what you are mate,
a fucking prison poof.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.789
I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:06.290
Here, what you doing?

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.458
What's it fucking
look like I'm doing?

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:10.253
No don't, mate, no, no, what about
all the work you've been doing,

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:13.214
all the stuff, all the changes
you've been going through in class.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:15.633
Group.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:17.681
It's a fucking group, not a class.

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:21.305
You're a fucking man
now, aren't you?

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:22.890
You're a fucking man, ain't you...

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.017
All right, we can fucking do this.

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:27.979
Come on then, let's fucking
have it, let's have it.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.163
Ain't fucking...

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:55.469
All right... I fucking...

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:56.841
I give up.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:59.427
You fucking got me.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.178
- You let me win.
- I didn't fucking let you win.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.723
Yes, you fucking did, you
mug, you let me fucking win.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.266
I didn't fucking let you win.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:06.809
Yes, you did, you mugged
me right off, you cunt.

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:07.852
I didn't.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:11.402
You've been fucking
training. Fucking hell.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.649
Fucking fuck all, that's
what you are, mate.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.744
That's right. Oi, I'm
talking to you, cunt.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.196
Walking away as per
usual. Look at you.

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:20.573
Turn round.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:22.199
Can't, can you?

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.909
Can't fucking face me, can you?

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:26.662
Cause you're not a fucking man.
More like a fucking fraggle.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:30.875
Come on then, round two, let's
do it proper now. Come on. No?

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:32.835
Don't fucking want it, do you?

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:35.212
'Cause you know you'll get
fucking filled in, that's why.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:37.757
I've got fucking 19 years
of this for you, cunt.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.216
- Young man.
- Just fucking say the words

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.761
- and I'll come straight at you, cunt. Hey?
- No, no.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:44.889
Remember what I told you. In
my cell, conversation we had?

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:46.098
Boy, boy...

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:47.725
Shut up, Neville!

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.479
Now there is a way through this.
I know, because you are like me.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.689
- Like you.
- Potential is what you possess, Eric.

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:55.942
Fuck off you, little fuck!

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.739
Look what you made me do
now, yeah? Fucking well done.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.824
I'm down here for
fucking years, mate.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.994
Make sure you fucking come and
hit me fucking hard, boys.

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.463
Somebody get his fucking inhaler.

01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:13.961
Boy.

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.721
- Get behind your door!
- Move!

01:26:20.133 --> 01:26:22.134
Fucking queer hands off me, cunt.

01:26:22.135 --> 01:26:24.057
Step aside!

01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:27.606
Eric, easy!

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:29.975
Take it easy, boy!

01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:31.185
Don't fucking kill him!

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:33.484
Fucking... Fucking...

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.025
Fucking milk-fed cunts.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.569
Fucking back to your lube
now, you fucking queer.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:43.239
Least I've had a shag.
Fucking virgin.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:46.867
Saw a pussy, wouldn't know whether
to fuck it or slide it a saucer of milk.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:49.745
Fuck off, you fucking bender!

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:51.372
At least I'll be out
of here one day

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:54.250
fucking ironing out one
clitoris after the other, cunt.

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:58.629
Don't care, mate. I like a nice
tight hairy little asshole.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.633
Give yourself 10 years, boy,
I think you'll feel the same.

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.932
You dick-sucking cunt!

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:13.144
I only fucking aimed to
kick off her back door

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:16.480
and pronged the other
hole by mistake... Ah.

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:19.234
Else you wouldn't
even fucking be here!

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.785
All right!

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.830
Fuck's sake.

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:28.834
Legs!

01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:35.041
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.177
Go to fucking...

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:41.514
Clear!

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.344
Fucking had presents
wrapped tighter than this!

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:48.179
Fucking civil servant cunts!

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.140
Take your fucking pips off,
let's fucking have it!

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:55.895
Come on you...

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:02.151
Fucking have the lot of you.

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:04.945
Come on, take your
fucking pips off!

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.113
Let's fucking have you!

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:09.576
The whole fucking gang of you!

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:14.413
Fucking men?

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:18.793
My old fucking grandma could
have fucking had any of you,

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:21.467
on her 60th fucking day!

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:23.005
Let's fucking go at it, you cunt!

01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:26.093
One on one!

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:29.513
Come on, you fucking cunts!

01:28:29.763 --> 01:28:34.767
You fucking suck the cock of
cunt, you fucking assholes!

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:35.851
Go.

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:38.187
Oh, fucking shower, is it?

01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:40.397
You fucking women!

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:42.233
Hey, what do you fucking need?

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:48.036
Clean my asshole while you're
at it, you fucking nancy boy!

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.759
Boy!

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:06.466
Boy!

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:12.722
If you've fucking touched him!
If you've touched him!

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.851
Come on boy, answer me.

01:29:16.852 --> 01:29:19.103
Don't fucking leave
me hanging like this.

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:21.105
Just stop all the fucking around

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:24.029
and answer me! I need to
hear your fucking voice.

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.078
Boy!

01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:30.497
Don't fucking mug me off!

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:34.167
Boy!

01:29:36.454 --> 01:29:38.873
You touch him, you
fucking touch him!

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:40.921
Oh, fuck off.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:45.054
What they do to you?

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.889
Fuck all.

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:53.476
Bottled it, didn't they.

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:58.183
What, they didn't do nothing?

01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.152
No, fuck all.

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:02.070
Pussy holes.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:18.375
Junior?

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:42.528
I'm gonna fucking top myself.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:44.735
I...

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:47.900
I'm gonna fucking do
it, I swear to God.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:51.111
I'm gonna smash my fucking head

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:53.489
over on that fucking sink.

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:55.366
Get me fucking Selfy.

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.034
Get me him, he's the
only one who knows

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.703
how to fucking deal with
me when I'm like this.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.747
I'm gonna do it, I swear.

01:31:01.748 --> 01:31:04.501
Please, please.

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:07.587
Please do it.

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:13.809
Who else fancies a pint?
I'd be up for that.

01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:16.513
Cheers, lads.

01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:23.852
- You have a good night, yeah.
- Yeah, home free.

01:31:23.853 --> 01:31:25.775
All right, take it easy.

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:33.155
Here.

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:34.822
Open the door.

01:31:34.823 --> 01:31:36.916
No, I can't Nev.

01:31:38.827 --> 01:31:40.077
Why not?

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:41.537
'Cause Haynes is on Center.

01:31:41.538 --> 01:31:42.955
Oh, fuck that.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.540
Come on, Selfy, open the door.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:48.085
I just, I just want to fucking
get these off. I can't stand it.

01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:49.461
It's doing my fucking head in.

01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:51.509
All right.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.723
You're soaking wet.

01:32:00.724 --> 01:32:04.103
Why do you think? They gave me
a fucking bath, didn't they?

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:07.229
- You all right though, yeah?
- Yeah, mate, it's fucking mad.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:10.734
They fucking give me the hose.
You know, fucking wouldn't stop...

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:14.870
Sorry, mate.

01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:39.488
- Where's Self?
- Don't know.

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:06.557
Face the wall.

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:09.898
Back on the wing.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:15.195
Hey, you gave me the
opportunity. Fair play.

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:19.195
But... I'm...

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.699
I'm not wired up right in the, um,

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.953
the father rote, you know,
I can see that now.

01:34:28.204 --> 01:34:29.997
But I do need to know he's safe.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:31.415
I need to know that, Dennis.

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:34.251
Because there's one
thing I will not allow,

01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:38.097
under any circumstances,
and that is for anyone...

01:34:39.632 --> 01:34:42.009
To fucking top my kid.

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:44.808
Okay?

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:50.943
You know I could never harm
your flesh and blood, Neville.

01:34:57.817 --> 01:35:01.241
The whole point is
safeguarding him.

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:03.655
Get you on your toes
to teach him how,

01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:05.574
because it's not always
possible for you to be there

01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:07.668
- to protect him from himself.
- Yeah.

01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:09.620
You little fucking cunt.

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:11.623
Ah... Fuck.

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:15.297
I don't normally say this, but...

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:18.630
You're like family to me.

01:35:22.008 --> 01:35:23.885
I care about you, Neville.

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:27.646
You're like you're me own.

01:35:39.067 --> 01:35:40.819
You fuck.

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:45.244
Fucking...

01:35:57.835 --> 01:36:01.464
Haynes wanted it. Not me.
I had to go along.

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:09.721
Get down there quick.
You can save him.

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:16.063
It's all right, Dennis,
you won't feel a thing.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:17.772
Argh!

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.120
Okay, go.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.264
Hold him, hold him!

01:36:55.059 --> 01:36:57.027
Argh!

01:37:04.444 --> 01:37:06.611
No! Fucking...

01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:09.114
- Cut him down, cut him down!
- All right, all right.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.505
Sierra Foxtrot from Kilo One, over.

01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:27.758
<i>Kilo One, send.</i>

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:29.602
Attempted suicide

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.261
in CSU, over.

01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:33.096
Come on then, boy.

01:37:33.097 --> 01:37:37.318
Eric. Eric stay, please.

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:44.445
Oh, shit.

01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:50.531
It's all right, it's all right.

01:37:54.035 --> 01:37:55.786
You're all right, you're all right.

01:37:55.787 --> 01:37:58.455
Daddy's here, I'm here.

01:37:58.456 --> 01:38:01.675
I'm here, I'm here.

01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:12.053
Okay.

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.445
Eric.

01:39:06.816 --> 01:39:09.068
- Blood!
- Eric.

01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:14.494
Eric.

01:39:18.536 --> 01:39:19.995
Hey, fucking answer me, blood.

01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:22.122
Else it's you, bruv.
We're coming for you.

01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:24.546
Fuck off, you bunch of tarts.

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:27.878
Hey, you fuck off.

01:39:27.879 --> 01:39:29.045
You all right, bruv?

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:31.799
- Yeah, sweet.
- D Wing coming in!

01:39:32.592 --> 01:39:34.926
Hey, hold it down, yeah, bruvva.

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:36.599
All right, cool.

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:51.823
Half hour outside.

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:54.488
Come on, do you good.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.172
Dad!

01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:48.626
Proud to be your dad.

01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:13.446
- Thanks, guv.
- Welcome, son.
