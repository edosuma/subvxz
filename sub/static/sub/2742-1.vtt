02:30.266 --> 02:33.958
Well, I do want our readers
to feel that this is really your story

02:34.058 --> 02:36.041
so I thought I'd, perhaps,
ask a few questions

02:36.141 --> 02:38.791
and if you just answer them
in your own words.

02:38.891 --> 02:41.708
Yes, I see. All right, ask away.

02:41.808 --> 02:44.833
Well, let's start
at the beginning, shall we?

02:44.933 --> 02:48.333
Well, I... I had a terribly
ordinary childhood, I'm afraid.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.583
Born at an early age and all that.

02:50.683 --> 02:53.291
Fell off lots of bicycles,
ate too many cream cakes.

02:53.391 --> 02:55.625
A normal childhood, you know.

02:55.725 --> 02:58.291
Oh, this is me, age six.

02:58.391 --> 03:01.750
Probably a piece of chewing gum stuck
under my hat, only you can't see.

03:01.850 --> 03:06.541
I do remember I was always the sort of
child who got picked on to do things.

03:06.641 --> 03:10.458
La-la-la, la-la-la...

03:10.558 --> 03:12.583
What a darling little baby he is!

03:12.683 --> 03:15.333
Joseph was actually
my older sister Felicity.

03:15.433 --> 03:18.500
I am afraid I told everyone she'd
grown the beard specially for the part.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.240
Felicity, poor thing, was not amused.

03:22.850 --> 03:26.625
You must be very proud of her,
Mrs Carter.

03:26.725 --> 03:28.791
She's a darling.

03:28.891 --> 03:31.083
She's going to go a long way.

03:31.183 --> 03:33.041
You can see that.

03:33.141 --> 03:35.949
Yes, I think she is.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.250
This is me, age 20.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.875
I don't know what I was wearing.

03:40.975 --> 03:42.833
Terribly Chelsea I thought I was.

03:42.933 --> 03:46.157
And, really, I suppose I was
as square as an ice cube with it.

03:51.516 --> 03:53.208
- Try that one over there.
- Right you are.

03:53.308 --> 03:55.416
- What, me on the telly?
- It won't take a minute.

03:55.516 --> 03:57.208
How fascinating.
You must tell me what to do.

03:57.308 --> 03:58.833
Could you come this way, please, then?

03:58.933 --> 04:03.000
Oh, yes, I hate convention. You can't
breathe. You have to break away.

04:03.100 --> 04:05.699
But isn't the breakaway of
yesterday the convention of today?

04:06.850 --> 04:08.708
Well, then, you have
to break away again.

04:08.808 --> 04:11.125
Just for the sake of it?
Isn't that conventional?

04:11.225 --> 04:13.666
The way young people live today.
I mean in the way...

04:13.766 --> 04:17.500
they dress... the way they dance,
the way they talk even...

04:17.600 --> 04:19.500
That's more conventional than what
they're trying to get away from.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.375
Would you say the way
I dress is conventional?

04:22.475 --> 04:25.458
Well, you're dressed in the height
of fashion and your hair is...

04:25.558 --> 04:27.916
- Oh, I just wash and curl it.
- It's fine. We'll use that. Very good.

04:28.016 --> 04:30.199
What's more conventional than that?

04:33.266 --> 04:35.916
How conventional are we
in matters of public taste?

04:36.016 --> 04:39.750
The London skyline is constantly
altering and yet young architects...

04:39.850 --> 04:42.125
Thank you so much for letting me
see the finished product.

04:42.225 --> 04:45.041
- It's a very good programme.
- You really think so?

04:45.141 --> 04:48.333
Mm... I thought I looked ghastly
but it was a super programme.

04:48.433 --> 04:51.208
Well, I thought you looked super
and the programme looked ghastly.

04:51.308 --> 04:53.083
What's more, I'm right too.

04:53.183 --> 04:58.339
No, I thought you looked
frightfully lean and intelligent.

04:58.439 --> 05:02.041
I am frightfully lean and intelligent.
Not that it helps.

05:02.183 --> 05:04.000
Gosh, you must lead
such an interesting life.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.708
Being a professional questioner?

05:05.808 --> 05:08.125
Oh, it's better than
being a professional bosom.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.875
What's that?

05:09.975 --> 05:12.083
You should try posing
for Bride some time.

05:12.183 --> 05:15.407
I did once. Disaster.
A complete disaster.

05:17.141 --> 05:19.407
Oh! Is this yours?

05:20.475 --> 05:21.958
Why, yes, as a matter of fact it is.

05:24.433 --> 05:25.916
This one.

05:26.016 --> 05:29.240
- What do you think I am? Go on...
- Oh, my dear...

05:32.016 --> 05:37.324
There's so much junk in this car.
I keep on chucking things out...

05:39.475 --> 05:40.541
Have an acid drop.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.541
Oh, yes. I'd love one. Thank you.

05:42.641 --> 05:45.041
- One... two...
- Ooh, thank you!

05:45.141 --> 05:47.574
- ...three...
- Ooh, dear!

05:51.433 --> 05:54.750
Well, we... we just sort of
began to meet, you know.

05:54.850 --> 05:58.458
He had tickets for this or he thought
I might be interested in that.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.291
It was really mostly mental
to start with.

06:01.391 --> 06:03.500
There was nothing deliberate about it.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.824
We didn't know
what we were doing at all.

06:23.266 --> 06:26.916
- Oh, you're a thoroughly rotten shot.
- Thoroughly rotten target.

06:27.016 --> 06:29.199
You couldn't hit a dicky bird.

06:30.225 --> 06:32.407
Ooh, buried treasure.

06:35.641 --> 06:37.824
Heads we do, tails we don't.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.365
We do.

06:47.141 --> 06:50.365
Oh, how I'd love to live here.

07:06.558 --> 07:08.500
Well, we'd have to do
an awful lot to it.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.782
We'd have to do everything to it.

07:11.975 --> 07:14.157
Yes, you're right.

07:17.308 --> 07:20.125
Do you know these cottages
are being carefully rehabilitated?

07:20.225 --> 07:22.208
At great expense.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.750
"And will emerge as unique
cottage-type homes of distinction."

07:24.850 --> 07:26.791
Do you want to live in
a cottage-type home of distinction?

07:26.891 --> 07:28.458
I wouldn't mind.

07:28.558 --> 07:30.458
With a yellow front door
and a carriage lamp to match?

07:30.558 --> 07:33.375
- Absolutely lovely.
- You are ghastly. You don't mean it.

07:33.475 --> 07:35.208
I do!

07:35.308 --> 07:38.041
- You are a fantastic girl.
- Why?

07:38.141 --> 07:40.324
I don't know. You just are.

07:45.475 --> 07:48.166
Oh, it should be so easy
to be happy, shouldn't it?

07:48.266 --> 07:50.958
Should be the easiest thing
in the world.

07:51.058 --> 07:53.115
Should be.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.615
I wonder why it isn't.

07:58.975 --> 08:00.824
Maybe it is.

08:08.475 --> 08:10.657
Is it all right for Wednesday?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.615
Yes, it's all right for Wednesday.

08:20.395 --> 08:24.916
I hate this furtiveness. It's so corny.

08:25.016 --> 08:28.240
- It's ever so embarrassing.
- What do you want to do, then?

08:29.641 --> 08:31.824
I don't know.

08:32.850 --> 08:35.032
I do know.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.448
I don't know.

08:39.765 --> 08:41.541
I know.

08:53.183 --> 08:54.407
Wife.

08:55.641 --> 08:57.166
Husband.

09:10.475 --> 09:12.250
Come on, darling...

09:18.553 --> 09:20.583
Oh, it's so boring.

09:20.683 --> 09:21.791
Oh, come on, darling.

09:21.891 --> 09:25.258
You started it. It was your idea that
we learn the language for our holiday.

09:25.358 --> 09:29.166
Yes and all we'd ever be able
to say was, "Oh, what a lovely view!"

09:29.266 --> 09:31.583
Well, I'm getting on with it.

09:31.683 --> 09:34.115
All right, you get on with it.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.208
Of course I loved him dearly.

09:37.308 --> 09:40.208
He was one of
the nicest boys in the world.

09:40.308 --> 09:43.041
It's just that he was
so desperately immature.

09:43.141 --> 09:45.250
Marriage had been
sort of foisted on him.

09:45.350 --> 09:48.041
He just wasn't ready
for the responsibility.

09:48.141 --> 09:50.125
He tried nobly but, you know...

09:50.225 --> 09:53.208
He hadn't really got the faintest
idea what it was all about.

09:57.433 --> 10:01.083
Now, Mr Southgate, you have the
reputation of being something of a...

10:01.183 --> 10:02.333
a lone wolf.

10:02.433 --> 10:04.708
Is this a protest against
the establishment?

10:04.808 --> 10:10.958
It's true I have always
preferred to be a mouse, walk by itself,

10:11.058 --> 10:15.083
rather than a member
of a group of literary lions

10:15.183 --> 10:19.333
always licking each other,
washing each other behind the ears,

10:19.433 --> 10:20.625
and biting each other.

10:20.725 --> 10:24.990
And as you know,
they're behind bars in a cultural zoo.

10:27.225 --> 10:30.750
- They won't let you print that.
- Oh, yes they will, if I fight.

10:30.850 --> 10:33.240
- And will you fight?
- He fights.

10:35.391 --> 10:37.541
Er... something else.

10:37.641 --> 10:41.458
Now that you've moved down here,
into the country, into virtual isolation...

10:41.558 --> 10:46.074
Robert had marvellous tact.
Incredible maturity, sensitivity.

10:46.766 --> 10:50.583
He'd got this funny old bloke
spouting his head off. Fascinating.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.865
I'd never met anyone like old Southgate.

10:53.475 --> 10:56.375
Suddenly one felt madly "in", you know.

10:56.475 --> 11:01.166
I mean, to think: "This is one of the great
writers of the century and here I am."

11:01.266 --> 11:02.699
Well, it was extraordinary.

11:03.641 --> 11:08.333
I don't really remember much anyone
said. That wasn't really the thing.

11:08.433 --> 11:11.416
The thing was, they accepted me.

11:11.516 --> 11:13.458
Oh, I'm just dying to read your books.

11:13.558 --> 11:15.041
They're mostly out of print.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.958
- Do you mind if I help myself?
- Please do.

11:18.058 --> 11:19.625
Thank you.

11:19.725 --> 11:21.583
Well, it's been fabulous meeting you.

11:21.683 --> 11:24.791
- Are you a truth-teller?
- Yes, I think so.

11:24.891 --> 11:27.074
Is she?

11:27.891 --> 11:29.125
Well... she is with me.

11:29.225 --> 11:32.625
You consider yourself a very lucky man.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.907
Oh, yes, I do.

11:37.683 --> 11:39.833
Gosh, that's marvellous.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.166
I'm glad you like it.

11:41.266 --> 11:45.532
I'd rather have done it
than written half my stories.

11:46.683 --> 11:49.407
Probably only took him
half an hour, you know.

11:52.183 --> 11:53.541
I should like you to have it.

11:53.641 --> 11:56.583
- Both of you.
- I couldn't possibly.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.875
- Please.
- It's yours. It belongs to you.

11:58.975 --> 12:02.291
I'm 78 years old, more or less.

12:02.391 --> 12:06.458
Besides, I'd much rather you left
this place with this under your arm,

12:06.558 --> 12:08.907
than that recording of antique birdsong.

12:10.975 --> 12:13.157
Thank you.

13:13.016 --> 13:15.375
Just one moment please,
I have a call for you.

13:15.475 --> 13:17.657
Go ahead, Ipswich.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.708
Estelle?

13:21.808 --> 13:23.541
- How are the children?
- Fine.

13:23.641 --> 13:25.157
I shall have to stay the night.

13:25.808 --> 13:27.458
I'm staying with him actually.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.416
Oh. All right.

13:29.516 --> 13:31.541
So, I'm sorry.
Give them my love, will you?

13:31.641 --> 13:34.250
And tell them I'll see them tomorrow.

13:34.350 --> 13:37.574
Mm-hm. Bye.

13:41.433 --> 13:43.000
OK, your go now.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.532
Right, I'll get... some money.

13:46.391 --> 13:49.625
- Euston 4614.
- Go ahead, Southampton.

13:49.725 --> 13:53.166
Hello, Tony? Hello, love.
I'm still in Southampton.

13:53.266 --> 13:57.208
- Well, hell, what a bore.
- It's just as much of a bore for me.

13:57.308 --> 13:59.961
OK, yes. See you tomorrow,
then. Bye-bye, darling.

14:00.061 --> 14:01.685
Bye.

14:35.228 --> 14:36.699
Thank you, sir.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.532
Wait till we get these on.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.333
Funny pair, that Mr and Mrs Golden, 409.

15:08.058 --> 15:13.416
I suppose... you've done this sort
of thing hundreds of times before.

15:13.516 --> 15:15.416
You're wrong.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.583
I have never.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.865
Not exactly my line either.

15:21.058 --> 15:22.657
I just happen to love you.

15:23.475 --> 15:25.657
I told you.

15:27.766 --> 15:30.990
It is... real, then.

15:32.183 --> 15:35.407
It's the first time I've
felt real for a long time.

15:36.475 --> 15:38.375
Me too.

15:38.475 --> 15:39.541
Me one...

15:39.641 --> 15:41.824
Me two...

15:45.766 --> 15:47.324
Go on.

15:56.391 --> 15:57.958
Oh, look. How jazzy!

15:58.058 --> 16:01.282
Every three hours
we can call for refreshments.

16:04.391 --> 16:05.949
Welcome.

16:14.433 --> 16:18.699
The thought of breaking up a family
was absolutely repellent to me.

16:19.391 --> 16:21.833
If anyone had told me that
I was doing anything like that

16:21.933 --> 16:24.115
I would have been horrified.

16:25.266 --> 16:31.615
I have always regarded families
as... well... unbustable, you know?

17:12.724 --> 17:16.875
...and there's pictures of Cambridge.

17:16.974 --> 17:20.250
A very convenient door
through there, leading to bedroom.

17:20.349 --> 17:24.040
- A picture, reproduction, of clown.
- Glass is cracked.

17:24.141 --> 17:29.333
Yes... Mirror with gilt ormolu frame.
One clock, seems to have stopped,

17:29.433 --> 17:31.250
but I'm sure it only needs winding.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.625
And through here, of
course, you've got your hall.

17:33.725 --> 17:36.583
Er... the gas meter's there.

17:36.683 --> 17:40.166
Through there to the kitchen,
three steps up here to the bathroom...

17:40.266 --> 17:43.333
Large cupboard, very useful
for leaving one's coats...

17:43.433 --> 17:46.166
and then here in the kitchen
we have the gas cooker,

17:46.266 --> 17:50.032
which was put in by the last
tenant, so it's relatively new...

18:03.600 --> 18:06.500
Your books have arrived.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.782
And... your records.

18:17.225 --> 18:20.657
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.250
Hello, my darling.

19:04.350 --> 19:07.541
...it doesn't intrude on you
because it's been dead for so long.

19:07.641 --> 19:10.750
It has the sort of property of a sort
of beautifully laid-out corpse.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.416
You don't worry about it.
It's always there...

19:13.516 --> 19:15.407
Ooh, darling...

19:17.141 --> 19:20.583
Sorry. Are Liz and Willy
on or off at the moment?

19:20.683 --> 19:22.500
Oh, I don't know. I have no idea at all.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.541
What shall I put?

19:23.641 --> 19:25.958
Just put "With best wishes"
and leave out "to you both".

19:26.058 --> 19:32.875
"Luv, Robert and Diana. Kisses."

19:36.058 --> 19:39.250
- Happy Christmas, baby.
- Cool Christmas, honey.

19:39.350 --> 19:41.199
Happy Christmas!

19:42.391 --> 19:46.750
Darling, two gorgeous Negroes have just
gone upstairs. What's going on up there?

19:46.850 --> 19:49.032
They're having a diplomatic reception.

19:51.183 --> 19:53.500
Would you like
to have a diplomatic reception?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.824
What a good idea!

20:10.225 --> 20:12.407
I can't get them to go.

20:13.516 --> 20:17.541
Well, make them. Force them to go.

20:17.641 --> 20:19.000
How?

20:19.100 --> 20:21.541
I don't know.
Can't you force them to go?

20:21.641 --> 20:23.541
I don't know half of them.

20:23.641 --> 20:27.166
Oh, dear. I just wish they'd
all go away from our little place.

20:27.266 --> 20:29.916
Why did we ever have this... party?

20:30.016 --> 20:33.782
I don't know. I wish they'd all... go!

20:36.100 --> 20:40.782
Oh... my friends seemed to get on
very well with your friends.

20:43.475 --> 20:46.699
Your friends are so pretty.

20:47.475 --> 20:51.032
Yours... so intelligent.

20:52.391 --> 20:55.875
I couldn't have been happy
if I'd kept Robert from his children.

20:55.975 --> 21:00.500
I was absolutely insistent, rain
or shine, he went and saw them.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.333
I couldn't have forgiven myself
if he hadn't done that, you see!

21:04.433 --> 21:07.166
"I've never really been
the jealous type.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.449
Where the hell have you been?

21:10.641 --> 21:13.865
- I told you. To see the children.
- Until this hour?

21:17.391 --> 21:19.791
Did you see her?

21:19.891 --> 21:22.657
- Her?
- Her.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.333
No.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.615
I don't know whether I believe you.

21:29.891 --> 21:31.708
What makes you think
she wants to see me?

21:31.808 --> 21:33.166
Perhaps you want to see her.

21:33.266 --> 21:34.208
Perhaps I do.

21:34.308 --> 21:37.407
Well, why don't you tell me if you want to,
if you're still in love with her?

21:38.100 --> 21:40.333
Oh, Lord...

21:40.433 --> 21:44.699
Look here. No, listen.

21:45.933 --> 21:49.157
I love you. Honestly.

21:52.141 --> 21:55.041
- You won't leave me, will you?
- Leave you?

21:55.141 --> 21:57.250
God, leave you... If you only...

21:57.350 --> 22:01.166
- If only you knew.
- I'm so...

22:01.266 --> 22:02.916
I'm so frightened sometimes.

22:03.016 --> 22:06.625
What do you mean?
What are you frightened of?

22:06.725 --> 22:08.375
Being so happy!

22:17.808 --> 22:22.074
Listen, shall we get married?
Get married and finish all this?

22:25.016 --> 22:27.291
Oh, darling, I'm so happy as we are.

22:27.391 --> 22:29.574
I don't want anything to change.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.291
If we got... married,
there'd be so much...

22:33.391 --> 22:37.050
bitterness and unhappiness
for everyone, wouldn't there?

22:37.550 --> 22:39.574
Darling...

23:15.433 --> 23:17.083
Good evening.

23:17.183 --> 23:19.208
An American statesman recently said

23:19.308 --> 23:23.166
that Britain was a country
which had lost pride in itself.

23:23.266 --> 23:26.083
Have we so much to
be ashamed of, I wonder?

23:26.183 --> 23:27.699
Let's find out.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.907
What are you ashamed of
in Britain today?

23:31.766 --> 23:36.083
Well... let's see.
Can't think of nothing.

23:36.183 --> 23:37.416
Nothing?

23:37.516 --> 23:40.333
Well, the traffic and that.
You know, it's a bit congested...

23:40.433 --> 23:42.625
- All the time...
- And that's the worst thing?

23:42.725 --> 23:44.833
Well, some people
don't work hard enough.

23:44.933 --> 23:49.375
Well, I work hard in Bristol
for one person, I do it for one person.

23:49.475 --> 23:51.583
Her name's Margaret Roberts.
I've got the photograph on me.

23:52.891 --> 23:56.291
Well, everyone these days,
wants something for nothing.

23:56.391 --> 24:00.958
They don't want to put anything out for
what they're striving to get out of this.

24:01.058 --> 24:05.500
Talking as a Londoner, I think,
in London itself, the amount of...

24:05.600 --> 24:09.500
how rife homosexuality
has become, in London itself.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.416
I would say again, in retrospect,
that a few years back, that...

24:12.516 --> 24:15.208
again, two or three years ago,
that you were...

24:15.308 --> 24:17.833
very blatantly sort of approached by
different people in different places.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.208
- Really?
- Mm-hm...

24:19.308 --> 24:22.375
And you do... It does sort of still...
It's still... You say it's worse?

24:22.475 --> 24:24.416
I think it's become worse
over a period of time.

24:24.516 --> 24:27.032
- But you have to live with it.
- Yes, I suppose so.

24:31.558 --> 24:34.791
- Try my London number again, will you?
- What was that number again?

24:34.891 --> 24:37.074
Flaxman, double-two-four-nine.

24:52.433 --> 24:56.875
Morphy Richards refrigerator,
gift of Mr Charles Glass...

24:56.975 --> 25:00.125
Number 81!

25:00.225 --> 25:03.708
- Here!
- Mr David Courtney-Barnett.

25:03.808 --> 25:08.083
Holiday for two in the Bahamas,
gift of Mr Samuel Goldstone...

25:08.183 --> 25:10.333
Number...

25:10.433 --> 25:12.083
68!

25:12.183 --> 25:16.708
Yes, me! But, I've just come back.

25:16.808 --> 25:20.458
Normally I never did charity work.
It's usually terribly draggy.

25:20.558 --> 25:25.449
But, you know, Robert was away and
Miles Brand phoned the same day.

25:26.266 --> 25:29.583
After all, he had chosen me
for the Honeyglow Girl.

25:29.683 --> 25:30.833
- Hi Miles.
- Hello.

25:30.933 --> 25:32.833
Miles didn't mean a thing
in my private life.

25:32.933 --> 25:35.708
I didn't attach any importance to it.

25:35.808 --> 25:38.125
Still admire yourself
as much as ever, Miles?

25:38.225 --> 25:39.708
Carlotta!

25:39.808 --> 25:41.833
How lucky it is you're a man
after your own heart.

25:41.933 --> 25:44.666
Darling, I thought
I could smell prussic acid.

25:44.766 --> 25:46.083
I put it down to the weather.

25:46.183 --> 25:48.750
It must make a change from
putting it down to expenses.

25:48.850 --> 25:50.541
How savage we are tonight.

25:50.641 --> 25:52.208
Somebody's husband
gone back to his wife?

25:52.308 --> 25:55.375
If he had, you would have
been there to greet him.

25:55.475 --> 25:57.458
Leftovers aren't really
my diet, my darling...

25:57.558 --> 26:00.083
Oh, I thought you were
always on the market.

26:00.183 --> 26:02.083
That remark was young when you were...

26:02.183 --> 26:04.916
- Miles. Mr Glass.
- Oh, excuse me.

26:05.016 --> 26:09.375
I suppose the main attraction
really was Charles Glass. You know...

26:09.475 --> 26:11.541
Mr Honeyglow himself.

26:11.641 --> 26:15.949
He's a terrible sweetie. Do you know
Charles? Oh, he's a terrible sweetie.

26:16.391 --> 26:17.875
82.

26:17.975 --> 26:19.859
82.

26:22.975 --> 26:27.041
Sean, my dear fellow.
I hear you're making a new movie.

26:27.141 --> 26:28.375
How the hell do you know that?

26:28.475 --> 26:31.750
I take a great interest in
your squalid career. I have to.

26:31.850 --> 26:35.500
If you're shooting full-length epics, you
won't want to do ads for the Glass group.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.083
Oh? Says who?

26:37.183 --> 26:42.125
A lie can be shot with integrity, just like
anything else. Who's the crumpet?

26:42.225 --> 26:45.449
- Most kind. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

26:50.433 --> 26:52.166
- Congratulations.
- Now, ladies and gentlemen...

26:52.266 --> 26:56.416
A few words from the president of the
charity we've been assisting tonight.

26:56.516 --> 27:00.875
Pray, silence for
the Right Honourable Basil Willett MP.

27:00.975 --> 27:03.990
A man of few words
and all of them long ones.

27:04.975 --> 27:06.833
Oh, you were splendid, Diana.

27:06.933 --> 27:08.958
I want you to meet Sean Martin.

27:09.058 --> 27:10.166
This is Miss Diana Scott.

27:10.266 --> 27:11.833
- Hello.
- How do you do?

27:11.933 --> 27:14.666
Would Mr Glass say a few words?

27:14.766 --> 27:17.125
I doubt it, but I'll ask him.
Would you excuse me?

27:17.225 --> 27:19.666
I want to say just this...

27:19.766 --> 27:22.291
that no matter how much public money,

27:22.391 --> 27:26.958
we, the government,
devote to good causes,

27:27.058 --> 27:29.333
there will always be a place

27:29.433 --> 27:35.041
for private generosity like yours,
ladies and gentlemen, tonight.

27:35.141 --> 27:36.250
Hear, hear.

27:36.350 --> 27:40.291
Never have I seen so many hearts
so obviously in the right place.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.875
Hear, hear.

27:42.975 --> 27:47.000
I'm sure I have no need
to bring to your attention

27:47.100 --> 27:50.208
the plight of our brothers

27:50.308 --> 27:53.291
of every creed, race, and colour

27:53.391 --> 27:56.541
in every far-flung corner of the earth,

27:56.641 --> 27:59.000
who, at this very moment,
are suffering the...

27:59.100 --> 28:03.916
the humiliation, degradation, shame...

28:04.016 --> 28:06.199
of the agonies of malnutrition.

28:08.266 --> 28:10.833
Well, of course I'd love
to make a film someday.

28:10.933 --> 28:13.875
So much is important,
the right director, the right script...

28:13.975 --> 28:17.708
Oh, you think a good director
makes a difference, do you?

28:17.808 --> 28:19.574
Well, it has been known.

28:20.308 --> 28:23.458
Oh. This is my wife Sybil. Diana Scott.

28:23.558 --> 28:26.157
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:27.850 --> 28:31.000
I think you managed that
very well indeed.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.250
- Ah...
- Oh, here she is. Diana.

28:33.350 --> 28:36.500
I was afraid you'd walked out in
protest against my speechifying.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.625
Oh, not at all.

28:38.725 --> 28:43.125
They're got something for us upstairs.
Crisps and Pepsi Cola.

28:43.225 --> 28:45.291
I am afraid I haven't seen
one of your pictures.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.625
So little time when one's
in politics to do anything

28:47.725 --> 28:49.083
except try and stay in.

28:49.183 --> 28:52.708
Someone said that Brooks-Romford
lost £27,000 last week...

28:52.808 --> 28:54.666
Actually, it's an exaggeration.

28:54.766 --> 28:55.625
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

28:55.725 --> 28:58.333
- It was only 21,000.
- Oh, is that all?

28:58.433 --> 29:00.083
Miles, how are you?

29:00.183 --> 29:02.458
Well, Your Grace. And you?

29:02.558 --> 29:04.250
Absolutely splendid.

29:04.350 --> 29:06.532
I'm delighted.

29:07.100 --> 29:10.000
It was said of her great-grandmother
that the only members of the cabinet

29:10.100 --> 29:12.500
who weren't her lovers,
were the ones who had reason to believe

29:12.600 --> 29:14.661
they might be her father.

29:14.761 --> 29:17.083
Poor Elspeth.
She's got a lot to live up to.

29:17.183 --> 29:19.333
Well, if it isn't the Lord Grant.

29:19.433 --> 29:22.157
My dear Miles.

29:23.891 --> 29:28.333
I like your black boys, John. I suppose
I can't wrap one up and take him home.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.666
I wouldn't advise you to try.

29:29.766 --> 29:33.250
They're all numbered, Alex. I wouldn't try
and change your luck, if I were you.

29:33.350 --> 29:36.416
- Everything's laid on...
- Now would you like to see the library?

29:36.516 --> 29:38.583
Only one way to preserve
a library, these days,

29:38.683 --> 29:41.324
and that's to build
a gambling hall around it.

29:52.183 --> 29:57.625
"This royal throne of kings,
this sceptred isle,

29:57.725 --> 30:02.875
"This earth of majesty,
this seat of Mars,

30:02.975 --> 30:07.500
"This other Eden, demi-paradise,

30:07.600 --> 30:11.865
"This fortress built
by Nature for herself

30:14.058 --> 30:18.083
"Against infection and the hand of war

30:18.183 --> 30:20.916
"This happy breed of men

30:21.016 --> 30:23.041
"This little world

30:23.141 --> 30:26.708
"This precious stone set in a silver sea

30:26.808 --> 30:29.166
"Which serves it in the office of a wall

30:29.266 --> 30:32.541
"Or as a moat defensive to a house

30:32.641 --> 30:38.208
"Against the envy of less happier lands

30:38.308 --> 30:43.750
"This blessed plot,
this earth, this realm...

30:43.850 --> 30:46.500
"...this England"

30:46.600 --> 30:48.125
Faites vos jeux.

30:48.225 --> 30:51.615
Rien va plus.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.574
Vingt-deux noir. Paire et passe.

31:09.141 --> 31:11.583
Cent, deux cents, trois cents...
Trois cents cinquante livres.

31:11.683 --> 31:14.990
Voilà, madame. Trois cents cinquante
livres pour le vingt-deux.

31:21.308 --> 31:23.490
That's the Glass house.

31:30.141 --> 31:31.666
What's this supposed to be?

31:31.766 --> 31:33.333
It's known in the group as

31:33.433 --> 31:37.666
Three Couples Taking their
Pleasures with a Fourth Looking On.

31:37.766 --> 31:40.041
Charming.

31:40.141 --> 31:42.115
Won't it be locked?

31:42.808 --> 31:44.666
One has a key.

31:44.766 --> 31:46.699
One would.

32:17.808 --> 32:19.125
Is this you?

32:19.225 --> 32:21.407
My secretary.

32:28.141 --> 32:31.250
Do you go winter-sporting?

32:31.350 --> 32:34.375
Yes I do. Do you?

32:34.475 --> 32:37.699
No. I don't do anything.

32:41.933 --> 32:43.375
What is it?

32:43.475 --> 32:47.199
Do you have parents?
I can't imagine you with parents.

32:48.016 --> 32:50.199
Yes I have.

32:51.058 --> 32:52.958
Two of them.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.250
Imagine if...

32:55.350 --> 32:58.875
- What?
- ...it took three.

32:58.975 --> 33:00.375
Took three?

33:00.475 --> 33:02.500
Sexes to make a child.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.782
Very entertaining.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.916
Everything would be different.

33:07.016 --> 33:09.824
Quite different with three sexes.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.365
Haven't we got enough problems with two?

33:19.475 --> 33:22.000
Is this where
the Glass millions are stored?

33:22.100 --> 33:24.166
Millions? No.

33:24.266 --> 33:28.125
Oh. Don't tell me it only contains
a pint of milk and a book of stamps.

33:28.225 --> 33:32.833
- Leave me my illusions, please.
- It's mainly papers.

33:34.850 --> 33:38.074
- Important papers?
- Very.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.666
Do open it, I should love
to see an important paper!

33:42.766 --> 33:44.949
I never have.

33:46.433 --> 33:48.458
Wouldn't you?

33:48.558 --> 33:50.740
Under any circumstances?

33:53.600 --> 33:56.791
If someone made it worth your while.

33:56.891 --> 33:59.032
Really worth your while.

34:03.308 --> 34:05.490
Have you ever been afraid?

34:06.391 --> 34:08.574
Really afraid?

34:17.891 --> 34:20.166
What's an important paper about?

34:20.266 --> 34:22.449
All sorts of things.

34:23.475 --> 34:25.708
People you are about to take over?

34:25.808 --> 34:27.000
It could be.

34:27.100 --> 34:30.916
People we're interested in,
for one reason or another.

34:31.016 --> 34:35.458
Don't people know when
you're interested in them?

34:35.558 --> 34:38.239
They know. Sometimes.

34:39.516 --> 34:40.791
Well, then...

34:40.891 --> 34:44.041
But they don't know how interested.

34:44.141 --> 34:45.739
No. I suppose not.

34:46.933 --> 34:49.458
That's not so easy to tell, I suppose.

34:49.558 --> 34:51.739
No, one hopes not.

34:56.516 --> 34:58.699
I wish you'd open up.

34:59.558 --> 35:02.199
I can't do that.

35:12.975 --> 35:14.708
Sorry!

35:14.808 --> 35:15.791
What for?

35:15.891 --> 35:18.000
Oh, I just seem to be leaving
most of your tyres on the road.

35:18.100 --> 35:21.282
Enjoy yourself with the compliments
of the Glass Organization.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.083
Don't you possess anything of your own?

35:26.183 --> 35:28.365
Only the things I can't replace.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.541
Of course I told Robert about Miles.

35:37.641 --> 35:40.416
It didn't mean anything, after all,

35:40.516 --> 35:43.791
but I was always, always
absolutely honest with Robert.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.333
I just had to be.

35:45.433 --> 35:48.375
And heavens... Well, there's nothing
wrong with somebody helping you

35:48.475 --> 35:50.407
with your career, after all, is there?

35:51.100 --> 35:53.708
Miles was just madly helpful.

35:53.808 --> 35:55.907
He knew absolutely everyone.

35:56.975 --> 36:00.199
He was just so madly helpful,
that's all.

36:05.475 --> 36:08.958
Well, we just wanted
to have a look at you.

36:09.058 --> 36:11.574
Yes, we just want to take a look at you.

36:12.350 --> 36:14.990
Well, have a look.

36:16.516 --> 36:19.208
Would you look toward the street?

36:19.308 --> 36:22.532
That's right. Now the door.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.750
That's right. Now,
I want you to look at me,

36:29.850 --> 36:33.074
but keep your neck the same angle.

36:35.891 --> 36:37.365
Well, what do you think?

36:38.850 --> 36:41.375
She's all right. She's fine. Fine.

36:41.475 --> 36:43.125
Has she enough profile?

36:43.225 --> 36:46.240
Yes, sure. She'll be
standing up most of the time.

36:47.266 --> 36:50.041
Excuse me, but I don't even
know what the film is called.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.375
Jacqueline.

36:52.475 --> 36:54.000
Oh, the book?

36:54.100 --> 36:56.074
- Yes.
- What part would it be?

36:57.183 --> 36:58.583
Jacqueline.

37:27.475 --> 37:30.699
So much for me. That's me lot.

37:31.225 --> 37:32.416
What?

37:32.516 --> 37:34.583
There was a bit at the end when
I was picked up by the ambulance,

37:34.683 --> 37:36.865
but that's been cut.

37:39.350 --> 37:41.148
Tough!

37:41.725 --> 37:45.466
From now on it's just about
who did me and why?

37:51.391 --> 37:55.657
You two men go round the back.
You others stay here with me.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.125
Yes?

38:06.225 --> 38:09.083
My name's Malcolm. Inspector Malcolm.

38:09.183 --> 38:12.041
Yes. We've been expecting you...

38:12.141 --> 38:13.782
This way, please.

38:15.725 --> 38:18.125
Phew. Oh...

38:18.225 --> 38:19.916
What a party.

38:20.016 --> 38:21.875
What a wake.

38:21.975 --> 38:25.083
What a bunch of zombies.

38:25.183 --> 38:27.333
Did you hate the movie?

38:27.433 --> 38:29.375
Or didn't you? You didn't say you did.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.666
Well, I did.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.291
- You didn't.
- All right, I didn't.

38:32.391 --> 38:34.000
You did!

38:34.100 --> 38:38.208
Well, I must say. I've never
been so insulted in all me days.

38:38.308 --> 38:41.157
Me first title role.

38:48.558 --> 38:50.750
Robert, what did you think of Miles?

38:50.850 --> 38:52.708
Absolutely crazy about him.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.166
Seriously, what did you?

38:55.266 --> 38:56.949
Well, what can I say?

38:58.141 --> 39:01.199
- You think I've been a fool?
- No. People do what they want to.

39:02.683 --> 39:05.490
- You are jealous.
- Who knows what I am?

39:06.558 --> 39:08.532
Well, you're the one I bed with.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.708
At present.

39:10.808 --> 39:13.375
I hate you. What a thing to say?

39:13.475 --> 39:16.699
What do you want me to say?
We both know what you're up to.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.532
Don't be jealous. There's no need.

39:29.183 --> 39:30.740
No?

39:31.266 --> 39:35.541
Anyway, this is the finish.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.375
- Of what?
- Me and showbiz...

39:38.475 --> 39:40.032
Oh, why?

39:44.225 --> 39:46.407
Well, it so happens, I'm pregnant.

39:51.516 --> 39:52.699
Are you angry?

39:57.058 --> 39:58.532
Are you pleased?

40:00.850 --> 40:03.032
I'm pleased.

40:05.308 --> 40:07.907
You should have told me
sooner, I'd have carried you.

40:10.808 --> 40:13.083
- I can't hear anything ticking.
- You won't for some months.

40:13.183 --> 40:16.407
- Yes, I know that.
- Yes, you would.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.500
Are you pleased?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.782
If you are.

40:22.975 --> 40:24.875
What shall we call it?

40:24.975 --> 40:27.907
- Jacqueline.
- Oh, but of course! Jacqueline!

40:41.808 --> 40:43.250
Shall I wear it to
Pat and Marjorie's tomorrow?

40:43.350 --> 40:45.166
Darling, it's much too soon for that.

40:45.266 --> 40:46.875
Oh, yes. Just for a giggle.

40:46.975 --> 40:49.199
Please, I'll have this.

40:51.100 --> 40:55.365
I hadn't really thought about
what it meant, you know.

40:56.141 --> 41:02.041
It seemed lovely, then I realised it was
going to be the ruination of my career.

41:02.141 --> 41:06.625
Messing up people's lives,
you know. Mine, Robert's, everybody's.

41:06.725 --> 41:09.583
I just began to realise
I couldn't go through with it.

41:09.683 --> 41:12.458
Heather was lovely.
She was terribly nice.

41:12.558 --> 41:13.916
Because, you know, she...

41:14.016 --> 41:16.916
she'd had a miscarriage
herself recently and...

41:17.016 --> 41:20.240
she sort of knew the ropes and that.

41:21.808 --> 41:25.250
Oh, thank you.
If you could be here on Friday at 11,

41:25.350 --> 41:26.791
that would be best.

41:26.891 --> 41:30.532
Bring overnight things, and, oh... skip
breakfast that morning, will you?

41:31.016 --> 41:33.615
Thank you.

41:43.183 --> 41:45.365
How do you feel?

41:46.308 --> 41:49.532
I never want anything
to do with sex again as long as I live.

41:58.808 --> 42:00.699
Well?

42:09.350 --> 42:10.949
How do you feel?

42:11.891 --> 42:13.449
Empty.

42:19.350 --> 42:21.958
- When are they going to let you out?
- Anytime.

42:22.058 --> 42:26.208
They've got lots of eager ladies.
They're queuing for the bed, it seems.

42:26.308 --> 42:27.782
I can believe that.

42:30.516 --> 42:32.240
I'm not going back to the flat.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.782
- I see.
- You don't, but it doesn't matter.

42:39.350 --> 42:43.375
All right, I don't.

42:43.475 --> 42:47.907
My sister came to see me.
I'm going down there.

42:48.641 --> 42:51.574
The country...

42:54.641 --> 42:57.449
- I want you to decide...
- Don't touch me.

43:00.433 --> 43:03.032
- I just wish that...
- It's no good wishing.

43:05.725 --> 43:06.782
No...

43:09.183 --> 43:11.865
I'll probably stay
at the flat for a bit.

43:13.141 --> 43:14.865
If you want me, that's where I'll be.

43:16.141 --> 43:20.041
- Don't forget to feed the fishes.
- Mm-hm.

43:20.141 --> 43:23.240
Poor little things.

43:39.975 --> 43:45.375
- Bang! Bang! You're dead!
- Oh...! Oh...!

43:45.475 --> 43:47.449
Are you really dead?

43:48.391 --> 43:51.791
- Dead-ing...
- Oh, you'll never catch me.

43:51.891 --> 43:55.000
I've got "Trouble at No. 10", darling.
What have you got?

43:55.100 --> 43:58.990
- I've got "Morality and the test tube".
- Nasty.

44:00.266 --> 44:03.490
Don't point guns, William.
I've told you about that before.

44:07.225 --> 44:10.865
- I don't want her to get too tired, Alec.
- No.

44:11.391 --> 44:14.375
Come on, William, that's
enough. Leave Auntie Diana alone.

44:14.475 --> 44:16.166
Come on, darling, don't be tiresome.

44:16.266 --> 44:19.490
Come on. Come and sit down
here and play with your comics.

44:19.850 --> 44:25.250
Darling, come and sit down. We don't want
to get you tired out. Come and relax.

44:25.350 --> 44:27.532
Have a comic.

44:29.183 --> 44:32.125
Pity you missed the daffodils.
They were absolutely lovely.

44:32.225 --> 44:34.500
- Would you like crispy?
- Just a bit, Alec.

44:34.600 --> 44:35.907
But no fat.

44:36.766 --> 44:39.041
Here you are, Ivor.

44:39.141 --> 44:40.875
You've changed your hairstyle, Felicity.

44:40.975 --> 44:45.125
You like it? It's a Hungarian
refugee who does it nicely.

44:45.225 --> 44:46.875
Gives it volume, which is what I like.

44:46.975 --> 44:50.291
Do start. Rupert,
don't stand on ceremony.

44:50.391 --> 44:52.666
- That's yours.
- Thank you.

44:52.766 --> 44:54.958
The lawn looks good, Alec.
How do you do it?

44:55.058 --> 44:56.333
Oh, it's that new Stay Green.

44:56.433 --> 44:58.750
What about that plastic sprinkler
I recommended?

44:58.850 --> 45:00.750
Useless. Couldn't
get the stuff through the holes.

45:00.850 --> 45:02.208
Oh, really, I'm awfully sorry.

45:02.308 --> 45:04.958
This is going to be one of those
frightful gardening conversations.

45:05.058 --> 45:07.500
I know it's therapeutic, Ivor,
but you really must stop.

45:07.600 --> 45:10.333
Oh, all right.

45:10.433 --> 45:12.375
Saw your film at our local fleapit.

45:12.475 --> 45:14.041
- Yes?
- Sorry not to see more of you.

45:14.141 --> 45:17.625
- Unfortunately, we missed the beginning.
- Best part. You were stunning.

45:17.725 --> 45:19.916
Ooh... Liked my black lingerie, did you?

45:21.850 --> 45:23.375
Ivor's been after to me to buy some.

45:23.475 --> 45:25.250
Really, Helen, is nothing sacred?

45:25.350 --> 45:27.293
Not much.

45:28.183 --> 45:30.750
See what you do to our suburban
morals, your type of picture?

45:30.850 --> 45:32.958
No, honestly, you were jolly good.

45:33.058 --> 45:34.500
- Thank you.
- Er...

45:34.600 --> 45:36.208
Rupert makes films too, you know.

45:36.308 --> 45:37.750
Oh, how fascinating.

45:37.850 --> 45:40.166
Honestly, Felicity, I thought
we'd made a solemn pact.

45:40.266 --> 45:41.708
No, you must tell me all about it.

45:41.808 --> 45:44.375
Well, it's something I had to do
with the War House, actually.

45:44.475 --> 45:46.208
- A training film.
- Oh, a training film?

45:46.308 --> 45:49.916
Mm. Erm...
How to Service An Armoured Car.

45:50.016 --> 45:52.865
Oh, a star vehicle, no less.

45:53.308 --> 45:55.500
- Oh, no...
- I hadn't thought of that.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.458
Nothing like yours, of course.

45:57.558 --> 45:58.750
Can I have the horseradish...

45:58.850 --> 46:01.157
- Alec, may I have the horseradish?
- Mummy!

46:03.058 --> 46:04.708
Whatever are you doing up at this hour?

46:04.808 --> 46:06.625
I haven't had my chocolate or anything.

46:06.725 --> 46:10.000
Oh, really, William.
You are being so boring, darling.

46:10.100 --> 46:11.416
We discussed all of this...

46:11.516 --> 46:14.333
- But I haven't had my chocolate...
- Don't start your snivelling...

46:14.433 --> 46:17.041
Don't worry, Felicity.
I'll find him his chocolate.

46:17.141 --> 46:20.125
Oh, would you, Di, darling?
Thank you so much.

46:20.225 --> 46:24.291
Well, see... She's absolutely brilliant
with children. Quite, quite marvellous.

46:24.391 --> 46:26.824
I...I do apologise. I'm so sorry.

46:31.391 --> 46:34.583
What was actually wrong
with Diana's original husband?

46:34.683 --> 46:36.500
Tony Bridges?

46:36.600 --> 46:38.333
Oh... too young.

46:38.433 --> 46:40.041
Rupert's the right age.

46:40.141 --> 46:42.000
And steady.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.282
Bridges was steady.

46:44.975 --> 46:47.708
Yes, but he was too young.

46:47.808 --> 46:51.032
- Rupert's the right age.
- Yes...

46:52.141 --> 46:53.500
Do you think he...

46:53.600 --> 46:55.291
Oh, I think he did, yes.

46:55.391 --> 46:59.240
- Do you think she...
- I think she did, yes.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.591
Alec, you've got your elbow somehow...

47:05.691 --> 47:09.699
I wasn't aware of it. Sorry, dear.

47:10.475 --> 47:14.041
What I shall never understand is,
how you and she...

47:14.141 --> 47:16.750
Same parents, same background...

47:16.850 --> 47:19.833
Yes, I know. It is odd.

47:19.933 --> 47:23.500
This chap of hers, in London.
Is that all finished now?

47:23.600 --> 47:25.916
Oh, yes. No question of that at all.

47:26.016 --> 47:27.990
Completely finished.

47:36.766 --> 47:38.949
I'm back!

47:44.808 --> 47:46.708
- Like that?
- I had to.

47:46.808 --> 47:49.333
It was so boring I could have screamed!

47:49.433 --> 47:51.500
You mean you came on
the train dressed like that?

47:51.600 --> 47:53.333
No-one noticed.

47:53.433 --> 47:55.615
What a funny girl.

48:05.558 --> 48:09.041
One day I will have to
bail you out of clink

48:09.141 --> 48:11.083
for indecent exposure.

48:11.183 --> 48:15.449
- Would you?
- Of course I would.

49:35.516 --> 49:37.291
Want some coffee?

49:37.391 --> 49:38.949
You know I don't want to.

49:40.016 --> 49:42.824
Sorry. Sorry I spoke.

49:46.308 --> 49:48.490
Would you rather
I went up to the office and worked?

49:49.850 --> 49:51.583
I don't know...

49:51.683 --> 49:54.250
There's something about a typewriter.

49:54.694 --> 49:56.732
Well... I'm sorry.

50:00.558 --> 50:02.041
Here, wait...

50:02.141 --> 50:04.699
Come on...

50:05.850 --> 50:08.666
Look, why don't you go and do something?

50:08.766 --> 50:11.000
Try that audition.
It's your sort of thing. Go on.

50:11.100 --> 50:12.750
Just go and have a go.

50:12.850 --> 50:15.708
Take the car... and don't crash it.

50:15.808 --> 50:19.032
Sì, signor. Grazie, signor.

50:21.558 --> 50:25.791
I want to dance. I want to dance.
That's what you'll never understand.

50:25.891 --> 50:28.074
I don't want to think, I want to dance.

50:30.850 --> 50:33.166
- Your name, please.
- Diana Scott.

50:33.266 --> 50:35.458
Diana Scott.

50:35.558 --> 50:38.083
- Would you like to wait over there?
- Right.

50:38.183 --> 50:40.750
Tell me about yourself.
What you've been up to recently?

50:40.850 --> 50:42.791
Well, I've done six months
at Bournemouth Rep,

50:42.891 --> 50:44.166
playing leads and things.

50:44.266 --> 50:49.333
Some television: Z-Cars, A vengers.
A season at Worthing Rep.

50:49.433 --> 50:51.666
A couple of Edgar Wallaces
at Merton Park.

50:51.766 --> 50:54.625
Cheers. That's fine. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

50:54.725 --> 50:57.625
- Thank you.
- Next please.

50:59.183 --> 51:02.407
Er... Miss Joy Green, please.

51:06.808 --> 51:09.000
Miss Joy Green, thank you.

51:09.100 --> 51:10.791
- Miss Green...
- Yes?

51:10.891 --> 51:15.208
- You've got a speech there.
- Yes. Yes, I have.

51:15.308 --> 51:18.500
- Right, in your own time, then.
- Right, thank you.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.833
- I want to dance.
- Louder.

51:20.933 --> 51:22.500
I want to dance!

51:22.600 --> 51:24.500
That's what you'll never understand.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.416
I don't want to think.

51:26.516 --> 51:28.490
I want to dance!

51:35.183 --> 51:37.583
- Hey. That's my meter.
- Sorry.

51:37.683 --> 51:40.666
I should think you are sorry.
Go on, get out of it.

51:40.766 --> 51:42.949
Women drivers.

51:50.100 --> 51:52.500
Grand passe. Once more.

51:52.600 --> 51:55.500
Grand. Once again.

51:55.600 --> 51:59.324
Un. Vite. Un.

52:09.183 --> 52:11.500
Well, look who's here.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.041
Your secretary told me you'd be here.

52:13.141 --> 52:15.750
- Hope you don't mind.
- Mind? Not at all.

52:15.850 --> 52:17.750
How are things?

52:17.850 --> 52:19.199
Flat.

52:21.225 --> 52:23.407
- Skol.
- Skol.

52:38.391 --> 52:41.416
Nice place. Had it long?

52:41.516 --> 52:43.583
Not too long. It's convenient.

52:43.683 --> 52:47.250
The firm owns it.
It came to us by mistake.

52:47.350 --> 52:49.532
Nice mistake.

52:51.141 --> 52:54.125
One tries to see
that one's mistakes usually are.

53:19.933 --> 53:23.958
I always feel as if there's
one more corner to turn.

53:24.058 --> 53:27.865
- And I'll be there.
- And so you will.

53:28.391 --> 53:30.615
And there'll be another.

53:31.600 --> 53:34.365
That's the attraction of corners.

53:37.475 --> 53:39.240
I do love Robert, you know.

53:40.391 --> 53:42.157
Why not?

54:25.558 --> 54:28.000
My goodness, what a bit of luck.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.625
What a clever girl.

54:29.725 --> 54:31.074
My lucky day.

54:43.016 --> 54:44.375
What the hell are you doing?

54:44.475 --> 54:46.791
What the hell am I doing?

54:46.891 --> 54:49.041
Sitting in the dark.

54:49.141 --> 54:50.833
Admiring the view.

54:50.933 --> 54:53.958
Well... good for you.

54:54.058 --> 54:56.916
Sorry I was so late.
The car got towed away.

54:57.016 --> 54:58.916
Did it?

54:59.016 --> 55:02.625
Bloody meters.
Had to go miles to get it back.

55:02.725 --> 55:04.333
Poor you.

55:04.433 --> 55:07.250
I would have been back sooner,
if it hadn't been for that.

55:07.350 --> 55:09.532
Where'd you have to go?

55:10.308 --> 55:12.000
I don't know.

55:12.100 --> 55:15.125
Taxi took me. I just know it took hours.

55:15.225 --> 55:16.583
Did you have to pay?

55:16.683 --> 55:18.875
I mean, to get it out.

55:18.975 --> 55:21.990
Of course. You always have
to pay to get a car out, don't you?

55:22.766 --> 55:24.532
What sort of day have you had?

55:27.225 --> 55:28.782
Quiet.

55:30.266 --> 55:32.166
What kept you?

55:32.266 --> 55:33.916
I told you. I had to get the car out...

55:34.016 --> 55:36.824
I mean, so that you overshot the meter.

55:38.766 --> 55:40.375
well...

55:40.475 --> 55:43.750
I didn't go to my audition.
I went to my agent instead.

55:43.850 --> 55:47.074
And I think I've got
a job coming up in Paris soon.

55:56.850 --> 56:00.074
- What's that for?
- Getting the car out.

56:02.725 --> 56:05.824
Where would I be without you?

56:21.016 --> 56:22.625
Of course, Miles was the perfect guide

56:22.725 --> 56:25.500
because he knew Paris
on every possible level.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.458
You know, the tourist level.

56:27.558 --> 56:30.990
And then he could take one inside and
show one how sophisticated people live.

56:37.016 --> 56:40.083
Oh, we went to
a fabulous wedding, I remember.

56:40.183 --> 56:43.416
Chloe Kalman, the film actress
had remarried Toto Damiano.

56:43.516 --> 56:45.416
You know, the American manganese heir.

56:45.516 --> 56:48.916
And afterwards we went on to
the most extraordinary place with them.

56:49.016 --> 56:50.791
They're astonishing people.

56:50.891 --> 56:55.583
Terribly sophisticated and sort of
emotionally inquisitive,

56:55.683 --> 56:57.708
which is a marvellous thing really.

56:57.808 --> 57:00.458
Mon petit Miles. C'est bon te voir...

57:00.558 --> 57:02.041
- Comment ça va?
- Ça va bien et vous?

57:02.141 --> 57:04.750
- Et la petite?
- Mademoiselle Diana Scott.

57:04.850 --> 57:06.041
- Are you English?
- Yes?

57:06.141 --> 57:09.000
Oh, she's beautiful.
She lives in England?

57:09.100 --> 57:10.291
- Yes.
- Yes?

57:10.391 --> 57:13.615
Bah, écoutez, entrez. Venez boire
du champagne. Allez!

57:15.058 --> 57:18.166
- A la vôtre...
- N'oubliez pas la petite.

57:18.266 --> 57:22.750
- A1ors, ici... A 1a vôtre aussi.
- A la vôtre aussi.

57:22.850 --> 57:25.708
Alors, je vous laisse tous
maintenant. Je m'en vais.

57:25.808 --> 57:28.666
- And... how are you?
- OK.

57:28.766 --> 57:30.416
Santé!

57:30.516 --> 57:31.250
Santé.

57:31.350 --> 57:34.500
Make yourself comfortable.
The young man is late. I don't know why

57:34.600 --> 57:37.824
Et vous autres, je vous
l'enverrai dès qu'il arrive.

57:39.308 --> 57:41.291
Billie...

57:41.391 --> 57:44.958
One of yours?
I thought I recognised the rubies.

57:45.058 --> 57:46.208
You're improving.

57:46.308 --> 57:48.916
Oh, Miles, I love you. You're such a...

57:49.766 --> 57:54.166
Oh, Billie. If I didn't know you
were a man, I'd be very shocked.

57:54.266 --> 57:57.907
Diana, darling. I want you
to meet Billie Castiglione.

57:58.933 --> 58:00.833
He's one of
the best sculptresses in Paris.

58:00.933 --> 58:02.750
He's dying to do your bust.

58:02.850 --> 58:06.416
I'm going to kill that man, I am.

58:06.516 --> 58:10.708
You've got a beautiful head.
Wonderful bones. Truly.

58:10.808 --> 58:12.125
Thank you.

58:12.225 --> 58:14.907
Madames, Messieurs,
s'il vous plaît, asseyez-vous.

58:22.725 --> 58:25.824
Fumez si vous voulez.
Faites comme chez vous.

58:28.266 --> 58:29.208
Voulez-vous une cigarette?

58:29.308 --> 58:32.532
Oh, merci.
Je fume seu1ement des mentho1s.

58:37.308 --> 58:40.324
It's very hot in here.

58:43.808 --> 58:44.699
Merci.

58:46.058 --> 58:48.699
She's got an interesting head.

59:05.016 --> 59:08.657
Ce jeune homme arrive dans
quelques minutes, je suis sure...

59:18.058 --> 59:21.375
Entrez! Voilà. Finalement.

59:21.475 --> 59:24.375
Je suis navré, j'ai du retard,
mais le trafic était épouvantable.

59:24.475 --> 59:26.166
Vous savez que ça fait un
moment que nous attendons.

59:26.266 --> 59:29.041
Je m'excuse mais, c'est vraiment
impossible de parquer la voiture.

59:29.141 --> 59:30.750
Nulle part...

59:30.850 --> 59:34.166
C'est affreux de parquer. Ça fait
une demi-heure dans la rue en bas...

59:34.266 --> 59:36.907
C'est partout.

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:15.500
Dis donc, on commence à s'ennuyer ici.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.125
Si on jouait au jeu?

01:00:17.225 --> 01:00:21.074
Mais si, un peu de home movies!
Allez. Vous allez voir, c'est marrant.

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:32.500
Mes amis, nous allons jouer
la spécialité de la maison.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.500
Qu'est-ce que c'est?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.824
Bien, c'est une espèce de
cinéma vérité un peu existentiel.

01:00:38.516 --> 01:00:40.958
Tu veux jouer aussi?

01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:43.500
André. The music, please!

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.416
This is going to be fun.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:46.833
What is it?

01:00:46.933 --> 01:00:50.875
Well, it's a...
kind of a truth game, sort of.

01:00:50.975 --> 01:00:53.083
Come. You'll play with me.

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:55.291
Oh, no. I don't know how to do this.

01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:58.875
Oh, you mustn't be shy.
Everybody's doing it.

01:00:58.975 --> 01:01:02.657
Get up with me.
You don't have to be nervous.

01:01:07.728 --> 01:01:11.490
When the music stops
the cradle will rock.

01:02:06.058 --> 01:02:09.240
- Stop the music.
- Pausez-la. Pausez-la.

01:02:14.558 --> 01:02:17.907
Why, Diana Scott. How you've changed!

01:02:19.391 --> 01:02:23.833
Why, darling. It's only because
I've had a little too much sunray.

01:02:26.266 --> 01:02:28.875
I don't understand.
Is he pretending to be me?

01:02:28.975 --> 01:02:31.291
You're home and dry.

01:02:31.391 --> 01:02:33.625
Combien de fois?

01:02:33.725 --> 01:02:35.666
I don't understand francais?

01:02:35.766 --> 01:02:37.625
How many times?

01:02:37.725 --> 01:02:43.083
Look, will you relax? Relax.
Don't be frightened, it's fun.

01:02:43.183 --> 01:02:46.500
Will you come on a cruise with me to...

01:02:47.204 --> 01:02:52.000
Only if I have the top bed.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.375
What would you do
to be in my next film, Diana?

01:02:55.475 --> 01:02:59.083
I don't know the name for it,
but I'll definitely do it.

01:03:02.225 --> 01:03:04.166
Why is he doing this?

01:03:04.266 --> 01:03:06.949
- It's fun.
- Recommencez la musique.

01:04:11.225 --> 01:04:12.875
Miles.

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:16.099
My dear fellow, I'd know you anywhere.

01:04:16.766 --> 01:04:19.500
Tell me, do you love Diana?

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.250
- No.
- Is she good in bed, Miles?

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.291
I haven't noticed.

01:04:24.391 --> 01:04:26.458
I am.

01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:27.532
Bravo!

01:04:28.016 --> 01:04:30.291
Does she love you?

01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:34.958
Like a prisoner loves a jailer,
cause I carry a big bunch of keys.

01:04:35.058 --> 01:04:36.791
Oh, shut up.

01:04:36.891 --> 01:04:39.375
Oh, blimey...

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:42.574
Miles, my love, have
you ever been in love?

01:04:44.016 --> 01:04:49.125
Yes... for as long as
I can remember. With myself.

01:04:49.225 --> 01:04:51.291
Touché.

01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:53.500
Olé!

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.166
Tell me, Miles.
If you could be anything in the world,

01:04:57.266 --> 01:04:59.375
what would you most want to be?

01:04:59.475 --> 01:05:03.166
- Molto divertente.
- A pimp in a royal whorehouse.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.282
Well played.

01:05:28.433 --> 01:05:33.250
Will Mr and Mrs Harper
please contact the enquiry desk?

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.532
Mr and Mrs Harper.

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:39.083
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:05:39.183 --> 01:05:41.583
- Is this all your luggage?
- Yes, it is.

01:05:41.683 --> 01:05:42.875
Have you read this before.

01:05:42.975 --> 01:05:44.083
Yes.

01:05:44.183 --> 01:05:46.125
Have you anything to declare.

01:05:46.225 --> 01:05:48.333
Only her lunch.

01:05:48.433 --> 01:05:52.708
I have a personal call from Paris
for a Monsieur Robert Gold.

01:05:52.808 --> 01:05:57.166
Western 7655.
Monsieur Gold? Ne quittez pas.

01:05:57.266 --> 01:05:59.449
Ne quittez pas.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:04.416
Robert...

01:06:04.516 --> 01:06:06.833
I just couldn't help myself.

01:06:06.933 --> 01:06:09.458
I mean, all I wanted to do,
really, was not hurt Robert.

01:06:09.558 --> 01:06:11.574
You know, that was the main thing.

01:06:12.266 --> 01:06:16.875
I kept thinking to myself, you know,
Miles would sort of burn itself out.

01:06:16.975 --> 01:06:21.625
And that meanwhile all that mattered was
trying to make sure that nobody got hurt.

01:06:21.725 --> 01:06:22.958
That was the main thing.

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:30.833
Tu sais bien

01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:34.375
Ce n'est pas la fin

01:06:34.475 --> 01:06:37.833
De notre amour

01:06:37.933 --> 01:06:41.791
Ne me dis pas toujours

01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:45.583
Que tu ne m'aimes pas

01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:49.291
Que je ne t'aime pas

01:06:49.391 --> 01:06:52.166
Oui, tout c'est bien

01:06:52.266 --> 01:06:54.990
Que ce n'est pas la fin

01:06:57.266 --> 01:07:00.875
Tu verras

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:04.166
Que tu n'auras pas

01:07:04.266 --> 01:07:07.958
Dans toute la vie

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:10.125
De plus belles songeries...

01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:11.416
Taxi!

01:07:11.516 --> 01:07:15.083
Donne-moi la chance

01:07:15.183 --> 01:07:18.166
Encore une chance...

01:07:18.266 --> 01:07:21.583
- Good luck with Robert.
- Thank you. Bye.

01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:24.532
Je sais que tu sais bien

01:08:10.808 --> 01:08:12.250
Is he really a crook?

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:14.791
Most certainly he is.
He's just served five years.

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:18.250
I've done an interview with him for
Sunday's programme. It's in the can.

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.000
And number 24: Man's Head in a Bucket.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.041
The strongest echoes of Grünewald.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.166
He has got a fantastically
lean and hungry look.

01:08:26.265 --> 01:08:28.457
Is it true he's so tremendous in bed?

01:08:28.558 --> 01:08:30.823
Oh, I'm afraid I didn't
get round to asking him.

01:08:31.433 --> 01:08:34.332
- Alex, darling!
- Diana, sweetie!

01:08:34.433 --> 01:08:37.041
- Oh, it's terribly to see you!
- It's terribly to see you.

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.375
- I say, isn't this is awfully?
- Yes...

01:08:39.475 --> 01:08:40.500
Come and meet Ralphie
before he disappears.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.750
- Oh... dear.
- For another five years...

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:46.375
in the great tradition
of silent screams.

01:08:46.475 --> 01:08:49.125
Goya, Gauguin, Guernica, that tradition.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.416
What I said in the interview I did
with him for the Southgate programme.

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:55.916
- Oh, tremendous fire.
- I'm with you. Tremendous fire.

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:58.916
A sort of furious lyricism one
seldom finds in Whitechapel these days.

01:08:59.015 --> 01:09:00.000
Quite so...

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.250
That's a load o' cobblers, all that.
One man responsible..

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:06.791
Ralphie, dear, I've got someone
here who's dying to meet you.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.832
Ralphie, you must meet Diana Scott.

01:09:08.933 --> 01:09:13.500
How do you do? I do so admire
your work. I think it's wonderful!

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.500
Thank you very much, I'm sure.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.865
Now Ralphie, come and meet the agent...

01:09:19.515 --> 01:09:22.582
- Oh, you got here. I'm so glad.
- He's an ass.

01:09:22.683 --> 01:09:25.500
Don't say that.
He's tremendously talented, Ralphie.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.125
When did you get in?

01:09:27.225 --> 01:09:29.250
This afternoon. Exhausted.

01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:30.791
This afternoon?

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.500
Yes, naturally, of course.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.207
Yes, naturally, of course!

01:09:34.308 --> 01:09:36.916
Look at him. Don't you think
he's tremendously talented?

01:09:37.015 --> 01:09:40.625
- What about the job? How'd it go?
- Tremendous fire...

01:09:40.725 --> 01:09:43.875
- What job?
- The job you went to Paris to see about.

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:46.957
Oh, I had to do a test for Raoul Maxime.

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:49.125
He's a tremendous talent, Raoul.

01:09:49.225 --> 01:09:51.625
There's no-one in England
to beat these new French directors.

01:09:51.725 --> 01:09:53.582
Tremendous fire.

01:09:53.683 --> 01:09:55.666
Yes, I think so. Tremendous.

01:09:55.766 --> 01:09:57.375
And you went down well?

01:09:57.475 --> 01:09:59.708
Like a dozen oysters, I think.

01:09:59.808 --> 01:10:01.500
Taxi!

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.833
We're not taking a taxi.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.125
Why not?

01:10:05.225 --> 01:10:07.407
I don't take whores in taxis.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.583
What do you mean?

01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.250
That's what you are, isn't it?

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.532
A little whore. Isn't it?

01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:17.458
You've been back from
Paris two days already.

01:10:17.558 --> 01:10:19.291
Look, if you don't want me
to find out what you're doing,

01:10:19.391 --> 01:10:23.240
don't leave your ticket and your
passport lying all over the place.

01:10:23.975 --> 01:10:25.699
Robert...

01:10:26.433 --> 01:10:27.791
I knew you'd get
the wrong end of the sti...

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:32.416
Your idea of fidelity is not having more
than one man in the bed at the same time.

01:10:32.516 --> 01:10:34.625
You're a whore, baby. That's all.

01:10:34.725 --> 01:10:36.907
Just a whore.

01:10:37.808 --> 01:10:40.574
And I don't take whores in taxis.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.833
Now what?

01:10:43.933 --> 01:10:45.208
A pound's not enough.

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:48.458
- What do you mean?
- A pound's not enough.

01:10:48.558 --> 01:10:50.875
- Now, wait a minute...
- Don't you give me "Wait a minute"!

01:10:50.975 --> 01:10:53.041
- A pound's not enough!
- Diana, don't be a...

01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:54.291
Don't you "Diana" me.

01:10:54.391 --> 01:10:58.166
It was kinky before and still is,
and a pound's not enough.

01:10:58.266 --> 01:11:01.500
Makes a lot of promises.
But when he's had his way...

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.666
You're not worth more
than a bloody quid, anyway.

01:11:03.766 --> 01:11:06.041
I'm an honest working girl!

01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:09.500
Five bob in the Walworth Road.
That's about your bloody mark.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.666
You crumb.

01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:15.458
You creepy crumb!

01:11:15.558 --> 01:11:19.824
Crumb. You creep. Let go of me.

01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:25.125
Five bob in the Walworth Road?

01:11:25.225 --> 01:11:27.125
- What were you doing in Paris, anyway?
- Working.

01:11:27.225 --> 01:11:28.500
I hope you got more than five bob.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.333
I should think I did.
I wasn't with you, was I?

01:11:30.433 --> 01:11:31.875
Fine. Help yourself.

01:11:31.975 --> 01:11:34.166
Oh. Quelle largesse! I'm impressed.

01:11:34.266 --> 01:11:36.333
You bitch. You're a filthy little bitch.

01:11:36.433 --> 01:11:39.208
You've got no right to call me anything.

01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:41.250
I have every right
to call you everything.

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:43.208
Oh, have you? We're not married.

01:11:43.308 --> 01:11:45.208
At least not to each other.

01:11:45.308 --> 01:11:48.458
I'd never have believed that one so trivial
and shallow could cause such pain.

01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:50.125
Oh, blameless Gold!

01:11:50.225 --> 01:11:52.916
If you want to know, I've stuck it out
just about as long as I can.

01:11:53.016 --> 01:11:55.208
Yes, and just about as often as you can.

01:11:55.308 --> 01:11:58.375
And you're so faithful
and so loving, aren't you?

01:11:58.475 --> 01:12:00.750
Look at this place, this rattrap!

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.375
- I won't be a prisoner any longer.
- So you're the prisoner are you?

01:12:03.475 --> 01:12:04.500
Yes!

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.500
Prying in my life, looking
in my handbag, spying on me!

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.833
The quickest way of getting to know you.

01:12:09.933 --> 01:12:12.958
You never intended to stay or you'd
have done something with this place.

01:12:13.058 --> 01:12:14.291
Look at it!

01:12:14.391 --> 01:12:18.083
Books! My God, I hate books!

01:12:18.183 --> 01:12:19.791
- Stop that!
- That gets to you.

01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:23.532
Anybody touching your books.
They matter to you more than anybody!

01:12:36.766 --> 01:12:38.824
Robert...

01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:44.657
What the hell are you doing?

01:12:47.141 --> 01:12:49.750
Robert, don't be so melodramatic.

01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:51.416
Excuse me.

01:12:51.516 --> 01:12:53.083
Robert...

01:12:53.183 --> 01:12:55.157
Where are you going?

01:13:05.933 --> 01:13:09.032
Oh, it just all seemed so unnecessary,
you know, these dramas.

01:13:09.766 --> 01:13:13.416
I couldn't help feeling Robert had been
desperately unreasonable about it all.

01:13:13.516 --> 01:13:17.041
You know, after all, we were
supposed to be adult people.

01:13:17.141 --> 01:13:20.791
Well, one just had to take
a grip on oneself, that was all.

01:13:20.891 --> 01:13:26.291
I just knew the only possible hope was
just to fling oneself into one's work.

01:13:26.391 --> 01:13:29.208
It was either that, you know,
or the old gas oven.

01:13:29.308 --> 01:13:31.125
One, two.

01:13:31.225 --> 01:13:33.833
Happy. Happy...

01:13:33.933 --> 01:13:35.916
The happiest girl in the world, now.
Come on. That's it.

01:13:36.016 --> 01:13:38.291
Good. Good. Come on, happy girl.

01:13:38.391 --> 01:13:39.875
Better.

01:13:39.975 --> 01:13:42.458
Brighter. Happiest girl
in the world, now.

01:13:42.558 --> 01:13:45.500
Now. Good.
Swing your hair round suddenly.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.375
That's it. Cool. Good. Lovely. Again.

01:13:48.475 --> 01:13:53.000
Good. Good. Again. Good.
That's it, darling.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.458
Look up. Think lovely... thoughts.

01:13:55.558 --> 01:13:57.208
Brighter. Come on, duckie. Forget it.

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:59.666
We've all been through it.
For Christ's sake, smile, love.

01:13:59.766 --> 01:14:02.449
Go on? That's it. All right. That's it.

01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:06.500
Come on. Sorry. Lovely,
dear. Come on, forget it.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.708
It's all right, don't cry.
Jolly good, jolly good. Marvellous.

01:14:10.808 --> 01:14:13.500
What is it, darling? What is it?
Come on, drinkie-poos...

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.282
- Drinkies, love. Come on.
- Oh, Mel...

01:14:18.891 --> 01:14:20.958
Gonna be a happy girl, then?

01:14:21.058 --> 01:14:22.625
Gonna be happy?

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:25.041
Cause we already are
a very pretty girl, you know.

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:33.916
Yes... She's very good.

01:14:34.016 --> 01:14:37.240
- I don't know whether...
- Thank you.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:40.833
Could we have a look at that again,
please? Thank you so much.

01:14:40.933 --> 01:14:43.000
- Yes...
- Yes...

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:46.166
The question is,
is she over-experienced?

01:14:46.266 --> 01:14:47.500
Sorry?

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.333
Have the public seen
too much of her face?

01:14:50.433 --> 01:14:53.125
How can you see too much
of this face, I ask you?

01:14:53.225 --> 01:14:55.375
We do get continuity of image.

01:14:55.475 --> 01:14:57.365
- Good thinking.
- Hear, hear.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.625
Buy her, then, do you, Kurt?

01:15:02.725 --> 01:15:03.958
Definitely.

01:15:04.058 --> 01:15:07.966
You know, she's got a sort of Aryan quality.
She'll go down well in Germany.

01:15:12.058 --> 01:15:14.375
How about this for the Happiness girl?

01:15:19.183 --> 01:15:21.282
But you must have a look at it.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.958
Yes. For the German territory,
I am happy.

01:15:27.058 --> 01:15:31.291
Well, there it is. We want you
to be the Happiness Boy, Kurt.

01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:33.500
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.250
Very well, then. We're all agreed.

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:39.625
Diana Scott, hereinafter
known as the Happiness Girl.

01:15:48.016 --> 01:15:50.875
For you, the man who
turned the tide at Monte Carlo.

01:15:50.975 --> 01:15:53.625
Darling. Bless you.

01:15:53.725 --> 01:15:56.041
Whoa!

01:16:45.725 --> 01:16:46.916
May I help you, madam?

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:50.333
Yes, do you think I could see some...
peaches in brandy, please?

01:16:50.433 --> 01:16:52.615
Certainly, madam.
If you'd just come this way.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.240
Yes...

01:16:59.808 --> 01:17:01.416
Have you got a larger size I could see?

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:04.324
Yes, madam. Just wait one moment.

01:17:05.433 --> 01:17:09.824
- Brandy. Bit expensive, but...
- Far too expensive.

01:17:12.266 --> 01:17:13.458
It looks delicious to me this...

01:17:13.558 --> 01:17:18.041
I am not with you! I have never
seen you before in my vie.

01:17:18.141 --> 01:17:21.166
You're in this up to your navel.

01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:23.199
We can't stay here all day, you know.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:26.291
Thank you Madam.

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:29.833
Oh, no. I did want them in a bottle.
No, thank you very much indeed.

01:17:29.933 --> 01:17:31.666
- We'll forget it.
- Thank you, madam.

01:17:31.766 --> 01:17:33.324
Thank you.

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:43.250
These look very nice.

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:45.833
Oh, what about these prawns?
They look delicious!

01:17:45.933 --> 01:17:47.250
Did you see that?

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.083
Outrageous behaviour!

01:17:49.183 --> 01:17:53.333
- I could've sworn he was following us.
- He was!

01:17:53.433 --> 01:17:55.458
- Outrageous.
- Oh, dear.

01:17:55.558 --> 01:17:58.833
- Robert...
- R-r-r-rule Britannia!

01:17:58.933 --> 01:18:04.208
- Britannia rules...
- Oh, my dear!

01:18:04.308 --> 01:18:05.583
Ting-a-ling! Shop's open.

01:18:05.683 --> 01:18:08.625
Ting-a-ling! The shop's denuded!
Honestly, you are outrageous, dear,

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:14.032
and I would like you to know, dear,
that we have only paid for shrimps.

01:18:15.225 --> 01:18:17.791
What's that? The Happiness Girl
contract already?

01:18:17.891 --> 01:18:20.074
Oh, dear, my husband wants a divorce.

01:18:21.933 --> 01:18:23.782
My husband Tony. He wants a divorce.

01:18:27.975 --> 01:18:31.199
Well, granted soon as asked, I'm sure.

01:18:32.558 --> 01:18:35.083
I... hate... this... flat.

01:18:35.183 --> 01:18:38.365
Well, you've got your escargots, anyway.

01:18:40.766 --> 01:18:45.083
Have an avocado, strangled with prunes.

01:18:45.183 --> 01:18:47.000
Have a bit of smoked salmon,

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:53.083
stuffed with caviar,
matured in fine English gin.

01:18:53.183 --> 01:18:57.032
For what you are about to receive
may the Lord make you truly thankful.

01:18:58.975 --> 01:19:03.449
Cheers!

01:19:10.433 --> 01:19:13.657
Oh, my life is a pisspot!

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:17.574
- Well, you see, I have the answer to that.
- Oh, yes? Have you?

01:19:18.266 --> 01:19:20.625
It's the bomb, lovey. It must be.

01:19:20.725 --> 01:19:24.125
That's right. It's the great, big...

01:19:24.225 --> 01:19:26.240
nasty, nasty bomb!

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:29.583
Let's face it, dear.

01:19:29.683 --> 01:19:33.166
Darling's life is
a great, big, steaming mess.

01:19:35.266 --> 01:19:39.250
Oh, I love you, if no-one else does.

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:42.458
- Well, no-one else does.
- Poor you!

01:19:42.558 --> 01:19:44.416
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do with you.

01:19:44.516 --> 01:19:46.500
Go on...

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.333
Well, I may be filming
in Italy next month,

01:19:50.433 --> 01:19:51.458
- Italy?
- Yes.

01:19:51.558 --> 01:19:53.375
Rather fabulous, darling...

01:19:53.475 --> 01:19:58.875
And if I do, I'm going afterwards on
the most wonderful holiday of my life

01:19:58.975 --> 01:20:00.750
and you're coming with me.

01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:05.666
- Oh, I am?
- You are! To hell with them all.

01:20:05.766 --> 01:20:07.833
We're gonna have a ball.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:12.125
- Have a ball, have a ball!
- Have a ball!

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.333
- To hell with 'em all!
- To hell with 'em all!

01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:17.407
We'll 'ave a ball! Down with 'em all!

01:20:29.433 --> 01:20:31.615
Ashes to ashes...

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.282
dust to dust.

01:20:51.808 --> 01:20:56.041
Cupids are the chocolates to choose

01:20:56.141 --> 01:21:02.416
For the one you love to caress

01:21:02.516 --> 01:21:06.916
Chocolates with the fairy-tale centres

01:21:07.016 --> 01:21:08.708
They're the best...

01:21:08.808 --> 01:21:12.208
Yes, there's nothing dreamier
than Cupid Chocolates.

01:21:12.308 --> 01:21:15.458
Those fairy-tale centres
take you out of this world

01:21:15.558 --> 01:21:18.375
into a land of make-believe come true.

01:21:18.475 --> 01:21:22.708
Fairy-tale chocolates by Cupid

01:21:22.808 --> 01:21:24.333
- Cut it!
- Cut it!

01:21:24.433 --> 01:21:26.250
- How was that?
- Not bad. Could be better.

01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:29.958
- Yes...
- In all, 35 seconds.

01:21:30.058 --> 01:21:33.375
- Listen...
- I'm a bit worried about the caress thing.

01:21:33.475 --> 01:21:36.583
Could he caress her this time? The jingle
does say "the one you love to caress".

01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:38.125
- Yeah, yeah...
- It's talking about the girl.

01:21:38.225 --> 01:21:39.291
We'll try it that way this time.

01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:42.750
Darling, listen. This time would
you... would you let him caress you?

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:45.291
Would you let... him touch your cheek?

01:21:45.391 --> 01:21:47.125
What? He... I caress...

01:21:47.225 --> 01:21:49.125
No, he caresses you.

01:21:49.225 --> 01:21:50.833
All right. Please, don't break it up.

01:21:50.933 --> 01:21:53.750
- Come on, boys. Quiet.
- Let's try a take for the prince.

01:21:53.850 --> 01:21:56.708
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello. How do you do?

01:21:56.808 --> 01:21:59.041
Excuse me...

01:21:59.141 --> 01:22:03.041
Don't you think that the house would be
much much better, seen from this angle?

01:22:03.141 --> 01:22:04.500
Er... yes, sir,

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.416
but you see,
it's a question of the light.

01:22:06.716 --> 01:22:08.921
Oh, the light.

01:22:11.933 --> 01:22:15.282
- Scene two, take three.
- Action!

01:22:15.725 --> 01:22:18.958
Yes, there's nothing dreamier
than Cupid Chocolates.

01:22:19.058 --> 01:22:22.166
Those fairy-tale centres
take you out of this world

01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:24.500
into a land of make-believe come true.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.750
As those fairy-tale
centres melt in the mouth,

01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:30.750
they'll melt the heart
of the one you love to caress.

01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:32.449
Fairy-tale centres...

01:23:23.516 --> 01:23:25.907
He is the Pope Urbano.

01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:30.199
One of my father's many ancestors.

01:23:31.058 --> 01:23:33.416
Should Popes be ancestors?

01:23:33.516 --> 01:23:36.166
Well, the call came late in life.

01:23:36.266 --> 01:23:39.490
He was an ancestor
before becoming a pope.

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.750
I don't see much resemblance.

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:47.074
He was better-looking
when he was younger.

01:23:49.808 --> 01:23:55.125
- Who is she?
- My mother. She was very beautiful.

01:23:55.225 --> 01:23:59.875
- Was?
- She died two years ago in a car crash.

01:23:59.975 --> 01:24:02.000
Oh, how awful.

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.333
- Very awful.
- Here you are.

01:24:05.433 --> 01:24:06.791
I've ordered some tea.

01:24:06.891 --> 01:24:08.657
How marvellous!

01:24:09.183 --> 01:24:12.000
Curzio's been giving me
some of the family history.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.583
Oh, yes.

01:24:13.683 --> 01:24:16.958
Excuse me, I must go.
I have a long way to drive,

01:24:17.058 --> 01:24:18.458
But I hope we will meet again.

01:24:18.558 --> 01:24:21.625
- I hope so.
- Goodbye. Till soon, then.

01:24:21.725 --> 01:24:23.500
Till soon.

01:24:27.516 --> 01:24:29.375
He's a nice boy, Curzio.

01:24:29.475 --> 01:24:32.666
Yes. Yes, very.

01:24:36.516 --> 01:24:39.500
- It's so beautiful.
- I'm glad you like it.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.916
There's nothing like
this in England. Thank you.

01:24:42.016 --> 01:24:44.833
But you have in England the most
beautiful country houses in the world.

01:24:44.933 --> 01:24:46.964
Have a chocolate.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.240
No, it's different here.
There's a sense of...

01:24:51.183 --> 01:24:53.125
eternity.

01:24:53.225 --> 01:24:55.407
A sort of peacefulness.

01:24:56.725 --> 01:25:00.574
It is almost... religious,
if you know what I mean.

01:25:01.391 --> 01:25:02.875
Yes.

01:25:02.975 --> 01:25:06.625
Well, it seems to make life
easier to bear.

01:25:06.725 --> 01:25:11.166
But you don't have any problem
in bearing the weight of life. Do you?

01:25:11.266 --> 01:25:12.583
I don't know about that.

01:25:12.683 --> 01:25:16.449
Well, on you it must weigh
very lightly. For me, it's different.

01:25:19.766 --> 01:25:22.208
I recently lost someone too.

01:25:22.308 --> 01:25:23.865
Not like you did, but...

01:25:24.933 --> 01:25:27.875
Well, I don't much care to
go back to England just now.

01:25:27.975 --> 01:25:30.666
- Do you have a family?
- Not like yours.

01:25:30.766 --> 01:25:34.532
Not that supports one,
gives one strength.

01:25:34.975 --> 01:25:39.500
- You have God practically in the family.
- Oh..

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.291
Well, you know, every man is alone in the
last resolve, and I more than most men.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:48.375
Well, perhaps not. In some ways.

01:25:52.308 --> 01:25:53.916
They're beautiful.

01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:55.958
Yes. Like their mother.

01:25:56.058 --> 01:25:59.416
They are. They really are lovely.

01:26:02.475 --> 01:26:03.916
Well, now you must excuse me.

01:26:04.016 --> 01:26:05.875
I swim with them every day, you know.

01:26:05.975 --> 01:26:08.625
It's a duty which is also pleasure.

01:26:08.725 --> 01:26:11.949
- Excuse me, will you?
- Of course. Thank you so much.

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:22.250
I don't think I'd ever needed a holiday
quite so much as I did then,

01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:24.708
and Capri was ideal.

01:26:24.808 --> 01:26:30.657
I just wanted peace and quiet and
to get away from everything, really.

01:27:07.725 --> 01:27:10.416
Campari?

01:27:10.516 --> 01:27:14.282
Due Campari per favore.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.625
We are not complicating our holiday
with any disgusting sexcapades...

01:27:25.725 --> 01:27:27.750
Brother and sister
till death do us part?

01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:29.791
- Done.
- Share and share alike.

01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:33.199
- Everything split down the middle.
- Absolutely.

01:27:36.183 --> 01:27:39.916
- Now, tell us what's new in London.
- Oh, nothing much.

01:27:40.016 --> 01:27:41.833
I'll tell you who I did bump into.

01:27:41.933 --> 01:27:44.500
- Mm-hm...
- Robert.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.958
- My Robert?
- The same.

01:27:47.058 --> 01:27:48.833
And?

01:27:48.933 --> 01:27:51.541
- Seemed OK.
- Alone?

01:27:51.641 --> 01:27:54.166
- Me or him?
- I don't care who you were with.

01:27:54.266 --> 01:27:56.333
Charming.

01:27:56.433 --> 01:27:58.041
Do you care who he was with?

01:27:58.141 --> 01:28:00.324
No, not particularly.

01:28:01.933 --> 01:28:03.041
What was she like?

01:28:03.141 --> 01:28:07.657
Blonde. 21 . Extremely
well-appointed, as they say.

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.907
Grazie.

01:28:13.975 --> 01:28:17.375
It's OK. He was alone.

01:28:17.475 --> 01:28:18.958
- He wasn't.
- I swear.

01:28:19.058 --> 01:28:20.875
You rotten thing, you...

01:28:20.975 --> 01:28:23.958
I know. Happy holiday!

01:28:24.058 --> 01:28:25.375
And you, principe.

01:28:25.475 --> 01:28:27.657
And you.

01:28:50.891 --> 01:28:56.865
- Oh, my, what a dream.
- Oh, it's super.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.416
I was just thinking how nice it
would be if we could live here.

01:29:50.808 --> 01:29:53.541
I could do without sex.

01:29:53.641 --> 01:29:56.115
Don't really like it that much.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.824
If I could just feel...

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:07.615
complete.

01:30:13.725 --> 01:30:18.250
Oh, Mal, let's buy this place.
It can't cost much.

01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:20.500
It'd be marvellous.

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:24.208
I want it more than
anything in the whole world.

01:30:24.308 --> 01:30:25.824
Happy girl?

01:32:58.850 --> 01:33:00.532
Mal.

01:33:06.516 --> 01:33:11.365
Are you ready, Eddie? Scusi il ritardo.

01:33:29.183 --> 01:33:31.365
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.824
- Caffè, signorina?
- Yes.

01:33:45.433 --> 01:33:47.875
Traitor.

01:33:47.975 --> 01:33:52.240
- Why the harsh words?
- Harsh word. One is sufficient.

01:33:53.516 --> 01:33:55.500
Darling, really.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.449
Brother and sister
till death us do part.

01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:22.916
Well, I happened to be passing,

01:34:23.016 --> 01:34:27.083
so I thought, why not drop in?

01:34:27.183 --> 01:34:29.032
Why not, indeed!

01:34:30.891 --> 01:34:35.791
Diana, I've been thinking
about you a lot,

01:34:35.891 --> 01:34:38.750
Oh, that's nice.

01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:40.625
And... what you said.

01:34:40.725 --> 01:34:42.375
Did I say something?

01:34:42.475 --> 01:34:44.791
Yes, about Italy.

01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:49.199
- How much you like it.
- Oh, yes. I simply adore it.

01:34:52.266 --> 01:34:55.824
Curzio is very taken with you, you know.

01:34:56.850 --> 01:34:59.541
Well... he's very young.

01:34:59.641 --> 01:35:04.208
He recognises a certain quality in you.

01:35:04.308 --> 01:35:06.416
I expect he'll get over it.

01:35:06.516 --> 01:35:09.166
I don't think so.

01:35:09.266 --> 01:35:12.625
He was very much in
favour of my coming here.

01:35:12.725 --> 01:35:15.875
As a matter of fact,
he persuaded me to come.

01:35:15.975 --> 01:35:17.250
Why?

01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:21.574
- I am afraid I don't understand.
- To propose to you.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.375
But... why couldn't
he have proposed himself?

01:35:25.475 --> 01:35:27.875
I mean it, it's
all ridiculously childish, but...

01:35:27.975 --> 01:35:30.666
Good you approve that
I should propose to you

01:35:30.766 --> 01:35:33.625
since...

01:35:33.725 --> 01:35:35.574
it is I who wishes to marry you.

01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:38.115
I see.

01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:44.708
There is no point in not
saying what is in one's heart.

01:35:44.808 --> 01:35:48.032
No really, principe.

01:35:51.391 --> 01:35:53.949
- Cesare.
- Cesare.

01:35:54.516 --> 01:35:56.333
I'm staying here until tomorrow.

01:35:56.433 --> 01:35:58.615
Will you think it over?

01:36:23.891 --> 01:36:25.166
Ciao!

01:36:25.266 --> 01:36:28.500
Buona sera!

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.824
Scusi ma lavorara.

01:36:33.141 --> 01:36:34.699
Le mani...

01:36:50.933 --> 01:36:53.115
- Ciao.
- Ci vediamo...

01:36:55.391 --> 01:36:58.125
I thought about it all last night.

01:36:58.225 --> 01:37:01.449
I hardly slept at all, Cesare, thinking.

01:37:02.891 --> 01:37:06.500
I know I can't...
I can't give up my life.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.824
You understand?

01:37:11.558 --> 01:37:12.625
Well...

01:37:12.725 --> 01:37:16.083
If you ever change your mind,
I shall not have changed mine.

01:37:16.183 --> 01:37:19.125
I am very sorry I gave
you sleepless night.

01:37:19.225 --> 01:37:22.250
I too had one. Goodbye.

01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:24.750
Goodbye, Cesare.

01:37:24.850 --> 01:37:26.250
- Andiamo.
- Sì, signore.

01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:27.907
Andiamo.

01:37:51.433 --> 01:37:54.041
Bye-bye, principe.

01:37:54.141 --> 01:37:57.282
Arrivederci, Roma!

01:38:25.391 --> 01:38:27.958
When they bury
Walter Southgate tomorrow,

01:38:28.058 --> 01:38:32.833
there will be buried with him something of
the regional tradition of English literature.

01:38:32.933 --> 01:38:37.333
Nowadays, it is London which,
more and more, devours the talents.

01:38:37.433 --> 01:38:43.541
"London, that damn jam factory,
boiling out the goodness from writers",

01:38:43.641 --> 01:38:46.458
as Southgate once said to me.

01:38:46.558 --> 01:38:50.958
A certain flinty integrity has gone.

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:53.291
Perhaps forever.

01:38:53.391 --> 01:38:55.000
Good night.

01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.458
And that's all from us for this week.

01:38:57.558 --> 01:39:01.541
We'll be back with you again with
another programme, in a fortnight's time.

01:39:01.641 --> 01:39:03.699
Till then, good night.

01:39:29.516 --> 01:39:33.208
Someone who cares about you

01:39:33.308 --> 01:39:36.833
Someone there

01:39:36.933 --> 01:39:40.375
When you fail

01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:43.541
Every time you try

01:39:43.641 --> 01:39:47.166
You need someone

01:39:47.266 --> 01:39:50.833
To help you get on by

01:39:50.933 --> 01:39:54.333
Someone to talk to

01:39:54.433 --> 01:39:57.916
Someone to love you

01:39:58.016 --> 01:40:02.041
Someone to walk beside you

01:40:02.141 --> 01:40:06.958
On the way

01:40:07.058 --> 01:40:14.125
Someone to talk to, baby

01:40:14.225 --> 01:40:20.125
Someone who needs you just like me

01:40:20.225 --> 01:40:23.625
And the one

01:40:23.725 --> 01:40:26.875
Who will understand

01:40:26.975 --> 01:40:30.500
Yes, and the one

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.125
Who wants to hold your hand

01:40:34.225 --> 01:40:37.625
Someone to talk to

01:40:37.725 --> 01:40:41.208
Someone who wants you

01:40:41.308 --> 01:40:44.458
Someone to love you

01:40:44.558 --> 01:40:47.208
More and more each day

01:40:47.308 --> 01:40:50.532
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ee-yay...

01:40:52.558 --> 01:40:53.916
Ice.

01:40:54.016 --> 01:41:01.041
Someone to talk to, baby

01:41:01.141 --> 01:41:07.041
Someone who needs you just like me

01:41:07.141 --> 01:41:10.500
And the one

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.791
Who will understand

01:41:13.891 --> 01:41:17.416
Yes, and the one

01:41:17.516 --> 01:41:21.083
Who wants to hold your hand

01:41:21.183 --> 01:41:24.625
Someone to talk to

01:41:24.725 --> 01:41:28.208
Someone who wants you

01:41:28.308 --> 01:41:29.916
Someone who loves you...

01:41:30.016 --> 01:41:34.699
Well... Where did all
the young flowers go?

01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:39.375
Proceed.

01:41:39.475 --> 01:41:40.875
Amuse me.

01:41:40.975 --> 01:41:44.458
Someone to talk to, baby

01:41:44.558 --> 01:41:47.907
Someone to talk to, baby...

01:42:24.141 --> 01:42:27.699
I wondered if you
knew Southgate had died.

01:42:28.641 --> 01:42:30.541
Could I?

01:42:30.641 --> 01:42:32.699
What's going on?

01:42:45.433 --> 01:42:47.615
I think you'd better go.

01:42:53.183 --> 01:42:55.375
Get out of here, will you?

01:42:55.475 --> 01:42:59.365
Just get out of here.

01:43:11.225 --> 01:43:14.125
I thought you'd gone too.

01:43:14.225 --> 01:43:18.208
You bastard. You really are,
aren't you? A bastard...

01:43:18.308 --> 01:43:20.541
- Would you like some tea?
- Tea?

01:43:20.641 --> 01:43:23.907
To calm you down.
You seem a bit hysterical.

01:43:27.391 --> 01:43:30.416
I asked you to go. Why haven't you?

01:43:30.516 --> 01:43:32.699
Because I've stayed.

01:43:36.225 --> 01:43:39.199
- What is it?
- Nothing.

01:43:39.641 --> 01:43:41.000
Are you afraid of something?

01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:43.708
I get the feeling
you're afraid of something.

01:43:43.808 --> 01:43:45.032
What's wrong?

01:43:46.058 --> 01:43:47.615
Wrong?

01:43:48.766 --> 01:43:50.032
Nothing.

01:43:53.975 --> 01:43:56.791
I didn't ask you
to leave Robert, you know.

01:43:56.891 --> 01:43:58.958
You never ask me to do anything.

01:43:59.058 --> 01:44:01.666
As long as you realise.

01:44:01.766 --> 01:44:04.250
As long as you realise
I just hate your guts.

01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:08.500
As long as you realise Robert's
the only person I ever remotely loved.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.833
When you've finished.

01:44:10.933 --> 01:44:14.074
As long as you're convinced, you don't
have to persuade me, my darling.

01:44:17.850 --> 01:44:20.199
You are afraid I'll kill myself?

01:44:23.433 --> 01:44:25.449
Has that ever happened to you?

01:44:30.850 --> 01:44:32.166
Who was she, Miles?

01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:35.666
Put away your Penguin Freud, Diana.

01:44:35.766 --> 01:44:39.500
- Who was she?
- And your crystal ball.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.824
It's late.

01:44:48.141 --> 01:44:52.125
Poor Miles. You can't risk
feeling anything, can you?

01:44:52.225 --> 01:44:53.625
I shall survive.

01:44:53.725 --> 01:44:55.958
Of course... as long
as you remain impotent.

01:44:56.058 --> 01:45:00.166
My impotence, my darling,
makes a pair with your virginity.

01:45:00.266 --> 01:45:03.375
Impotent in every way, except in bed.

01:45:03.475 --> 01:45:08.000
Don't underestimate me my dear. I can
also be very effective on the telephone.

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.824
I'll say good night.

01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:16.208
Life is full of "if onlys", isn't it?

01:45:16.308 --> 01:45:19.666
You know: if only, if only...

01:45:19.766 --> 01:45:24.032
If only Robert had come half an hour later,
the whole thing might've been different.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:29.916
Oh, I... I sort of felt
it wasn't any good, you know.

01:45:30.016 --> 01:45:33.250
I just had to go
and try to find him again.

01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:35.000
I remember thinking:

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.240
I bet he will be at that funeral.

01:45:41.391 --> 01:45:44.291
"The days of man are but as grass,

01:45:44.391 --> 01:45:48.375
"but he flourishes
as a flower or as a field.

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:52.333
"For as the wind goeth
over it, it is gone,

01:45:52.433 --> 01:45:55.115
"and the place thereof
shall know it no more.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.791
"We commend unto thy own hands
of mercy, most merciful Father,

01:45:59.891 --> 01:46:03.625
"the soul of this, our brother,
Walter Southgate, departed,

01:46:03.725 --> 01:46:06.083
"and we commit his body to the ground,

01:46:06.183 --> 01:46:09.041
"earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

01:46:09.141 --> 01:46:10.833
"and dust to dust,

01:46:10.933 --> 01:46:13.833
"in the sure and certain
hope of the resurrection

01:46:13.933 --> 01:46:18.250
"to eternal life,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:21.666
"who shall change the body
of our low estate

01:46:21.766 --> 01:46:25.208
"that it be like unto His glory..."

01:46:25.308 --> 01:46:26.875
- Miss Scott?
- Yes.

01:46:26.975 --> 01:46:29.166
- Lesley Page, Evening Standard.
- Oh, yes?

01:46:29.266 --> 01:46:31.166
I didn't know you knew Walter Southgate.

01:46:31.266 --> 01:46:34.458
Oh, yes, we were
considerable friends, actually.

01:46:34.558 --> 01:46:39.000
- When was this?
- Oh, about two years ago.

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.000
He found out how much
I admired his work and...

01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:45.083
sweet man, he invited
me round to see him.

01:46:45.183 --> 01:46:47.041
Which was your favourite book?

01:46:47.141 --> 01:46:49.750
Oh, all of them.

01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:54.125
As a matter of fact, I may be
filming one of his books in Paris.

01:46:54.225 --> 01:46:56.125
- Really?
- Yes, I'm talking to Raoul Maxime.

01:46:56.225 --> 01:46:57.949
You know, the French film director...

01:47:30.725 --> 01:47:33.000
- Hello.
- Diana...

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.125
- Yes, Robert...
- "Yes, Robert"...?

01:47:37.225 --> 01:47:40.333
Who is that? Malcolm, is that you?

01:47:40.433 --> 01:47:43.916
I rang to congratulate you,
I just read in the paper about the film.

01:47:44.016 --> 01:47:47.416
- Who is that?
- That is Diana Scott...?

01:47:47.516 --> 01:47:50.291
Yes, it is. Will you tell me
who's speaking, please?

01:47:51.266 --> 01:47:53.166
I wish I was Robert...

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:55.541
Please, who is that speaking?

01:47:55.641 --> 01:47:58.541
Oh, come on now, we met
a couple of times, at a party...

01:47:58.641 --> 01:48:00.708
For God's sakes, who is it?

01:48:05.183 --> 01:48:10.190
For Christ's sakes, stop mucking around.
Tell me who's speaking!

01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:14.282
Hello...

01:48:23.016 --> 01:48:25.824
Oh, I just felt I'd absolutely
no-one to turn to.

01:48:26.308 --> 01:48:30.083
No-one to turn to.
Nothing to fall back on. You know...

01:48:30.183 --> 01:48:32.458
Then, suddenly there
was someone who really understood,

01:48:32.558 --> 01:48:34.375
who really cared about me.

01:48:34.475 --> 01:48:36.750
Didn't want anything out of me.

01:48:36.850 --> 01:48:39.750
He was so terribly understanding,
Father Chapman.

01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:41.083
Do you know him?

01:48:41.183 --> 01:48:43.500
He's Monsignor Chapman now.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.699
Now, he's a terrible sweetie.
Terribly human.

01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:51.750
I suppose I've always believed in God.

01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:54.250
Just has to be a God, doesn't there?

01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:57.000
You know. Somebody who understands.

01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.958
Just has to be.

01:49:00.058 --> 01:49:02.791
I really took it
very seriously, you know.

01:49:02.891 --> 01:49:05.416
I knew I couldn't go ahead
with my marriage,

01:49:05.516 --> 01:49:09.250
unless I was really serious about it.

01:49:25.975 --> 01:49:29.166
It isn't everyday that we have
a new English princess,

01:49:29.266 --> 01:49:33.833
but it happened last week at the ancient
home of the Prince Cesare della Romita

01:49:33.933 --> 01:49:37.208
when our own Diana Scott became
the bride of this famous Italian prince

01:49:37.308 --> 01:49:40.875
and bobsleigh enthusiast.

01:49:40.975 --> 01:49:45.083
Everyone was there: old family friends,
the people from the estate.

01:49:45.183 --> 01:49:48.949
And, my goodness, how happy they were
to find themselves with a mistress again.

01:49:49.641 --> 01:49:52.416
The prince, who stems
from one of Italy's oldest families,

01:49:52.516 --> 01:49:55.416
has been married before
and has seven children.

01:49:55.516 --> 01:49:59.949
It isn't every princess who finds herself
the mother of seven on her wedding day.

01:50:01.558 --> 01:50:05.291
Simple family meals are something the
princess is determined to maintain.

01:50:05.391 --> 01:50:08.166
She intends to supervise
all of the family cooking

01:50:08.266 --> 01:50:12.125
and she's a regular and
welcome visitor to the kitchens.

01:50:12.225 --> 01:50:14.416
The princess has
always loved country life.

01:50:14.516 --> 01:50:16.291
She herself comes from Sussex

01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:19.907
and she and the prince aim
to spend plenty of time in the open air.

01:50:25.725 --> 01:50:29.791
The princess hopes to be a friend
to all sorts and conditions of men,

01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:34.157
not least those less fortunate
and less gifted than herself.

01:50:39.558 --> 01:50:41.958
Princess Diana is radiantly confident

01:50:42.058 --> 01:50:44.291
that she can make
a real and meaningful contribution

01:50:44.391 --> 01:50:48.250
to her new family
and to her new country.

01:50:52.433 --> 01:50:54.000
We wish auguri

01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.916
- "good wishes" in her new language -

01:50:56.016 --> 01:51:01.541
to a new Italian princess who will, to us,
always remain a British one as well.

01:52:23.516 --> 01:52:26.791
- Are you all right, my darling?
- I'm fine.

01:52:26.891 --> 01:52:28.875
Have you understood
what I said to Palucci?

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:33.208
- Enough.
- Well, I'm sorry, but I must go to Rome.

01:52:33.308 --> 01:52:35.375
The bank meeting is tomorrow morning.

01:52:35.475 --> 01:52:38.625
- And tonight?
- Oh, tonight...

01:52:38.725 --> 01:52:41.750
I'll go and see my mother. You know
I must go and see my mother.

01:52:41.850 --> 01:52:44.208
- Yes.
- Next time you must come with me.

01:52:44.308 --> 01:52:47.083
- But just now, Rome is not amusing.
- Yes, I know.

01:52:47.183 --> 01:52:50.416
- If you need anything, Palucci will...
- It's all right, I have plenty to do...

01:52:50.516 --> 01:52:53.375
Look, I'll be back on Thursday.
Probably Friday...

01:52:53.475 --> 01:52:56.250
So take care of yourself. Bye, darling.

01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:58.532
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:53:29.266 --> 01:53:30.416
- Buona notte!
- Buona notte!

01:53:30.516 --> 01:53:33.000
Buona notte! Good night!

01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.282
- Good night, signora.
- Good night.

01:54:22.766 --> 01:54:26.199
I'll send the car for you
at 12 o' clock. Enjoy yourselves.

01:54:36.766 --> 01:54:39.458
- My husband's mother...
- Yes, principessa.

01:54:39.558 --> 01:54:41.208
Have you her phone number?

01:54:41.308 --> 01:54:45.833
The principessa had the instrument
removed some years ago, principessa.

01:54:45.933 --> 01:54:48.041
So my husband is not
attainable at all tonight, then?

01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:50.833
One could send a telegram, principessa.

01:54:50.933 --> 01:54:53.208
That's the only means whereby
you can get in contact?

01:54:53.308 --> 01:54:56.541
That is so, principessa.

01:54:56.641 --> 01:54:59.791
Thank you. Thank you, Signor Palucci.

01:54:59.891 --> 01:55:01.657
Principessa.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.157
Grazie.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.666
- Are you resident in this country?
- No, in Italy.

01:57:36.766 --> 01:57:38.416
Have you bought any presents
while you've been abroad?

01:57:38.516 --> 01:57:39.791
No, nothing at all.
Just personal luggage.

01:57:39.891 --> 01:57:42.958
- No perfume?
- No nothing at all.

01:57:43.058 --> 01:57:44.291
You realise that perfume is dutiable?

01:57:44.391 --> 01:57:46.750
Yes, well I haven't got
any with me, anyway.

01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:49.416
- No, no. It's just all personal.
- You bought nothing at all.

01:57:49.516 --> 01:57:52.907
- No cigarettes or spirits?
- I've got nothing to declare.

01:58:02.558 --> 01:58:06.240
Hello.

01:58:08.808 --> 01:58:11.416
I didn't know whether you'd come.

01:58:11.516 --> 01:58:13.699
I was always easily seduced.

01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:17.208
Especially by telegrams.

01:58:17.308 --> 01:58:19.490
I hoped you would be.

01:58:27.475 --> 01:58:30.699
- You look older.
- You don't.

01:58:32.933 --> 01:58:35.115
Come on, I hate this anteroom.

01:58:42.225 --> 01:58:43.740
Well...

01:58:44.183 --> 01:58:45.699
Well?

01:58:48.725 --> 01:58:51.791
Isn't it a miracle?

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:54.074
We're still a couple.

01:58:57.558 --> 01:59:00.166
I thought maybe after all this time

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:03.541
something would have changed.

01:59:03.641 --> 01:59:05.449
It hasn't.

01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:09.250
We are?

01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:11.532
Aren't we?

01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:17.949
Thank God it's never too late.

01:59:19.516 --> 01:59:22.699
Two people really belong to each other.

01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:26.541
It doesn't matter what happens.

01:59:26.641 --> 01:59:29.375
This time, darling,
let's get somewhere in the country.

01:59:29.475 --> 01:59:32.083
Away from all this London racket.

01:59:32.183 --> 01:59:34.740
Somewhere quiet where you can write.

01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:41.208
We both learned our lesson and won't
make any more mistakes.

01:59:41.308 --> 01:59:43.490
I know we can be so happy.

01:59:45.016 --> 01:59:47.199
We're not going back
to anything, you know.

01:59:49.225 --> 01:59:51.407
This was just for old times' sake.

01:59:56.808 --> 01:59:59.083
Porter, please.

01:59:59.183 --> 02:00:00.041
What are you doing?

02:00:00.141 --> 02:00:01.916
Porter, will you get on
to London Airport

02:00:02.016 --> 02:00:06.458
and reserve me one seat on
any flight this afternoon to Rome.

02:00:06.558 --> 02:00:08.041
- That's right;
- What the hell are you doing?

02:00:08.141 --> 02:00:10.833
The Princess Della Romita.

02:00:10.933 --> 02:00:11.875
R-O-M...

02:00:11.975 --> 02:00:16.750
Robert, put down that phone.
Give me that phone. What are you doing?

02:00:16.850 --> 02:00:18.375
You are going back to Rome.

02:00:18.475 --> 02:00:21.041
I am not going back.
I'll cancel it. Give me that phone.

02:00:21.141 --> 02:00:24.365
Get up... and get dressed.

02:00:25.391 --> 02:00:28.333
You bastard.

02:00:28.433 --> 02:00:30.833
You just used me.

02:00:30.933 --> 02:00:33.750
You used me. It's a moot point.

02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:36.032
Now, get dressed.

02:00:39.141 --> 02:00:41.324
God, I hate you.

02:00:45.516 --> 02:00:48.041
It is not true, Robert. I love you.

02:00:48.141 --> 02:00:50.208
You know I love you.
What are you doing Robert?

02:00:50.308 --> 02:00:51.541
Please. Please, I've come all this way.

02:00:51.641 --> 02:00:53.865
Get dressed and I'll
take you to the airport.

02:00:55.016 --> 02:00:58.208
Oh, Robert, come on. It's only 'cause
I love you. Don't throw it away.

02:00:58.308 --> 02:01:00.333
I need you. Please...

02:01:00.433 --> 02:01:04.166
Will you get dressed?

02:01:04.266 --> 02:01:05.916
Robert...

02:01:06.016 --> 02:01:09.791
Just give us one more chance.
I beg of you.

02:01:09.891 --> 02:01:11.708
Let's spend a week together.

02:01:11.808 --> 02:01:14.615
- It won't hurt to try a week.
- I don't have a week.

02:01:18.725 --> 02:01:23.407
I...don't see how you can throw away
something that's meant so much to us.

02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:28.750
It doesn't put me off, you know.

02:01:28.850 --> 02:01:32.250
Being vile to me doesn't put me off.

02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:34.291
It puts me off.

02:01:34.391 --> 02:01:36.083
- It disgusts me.
- What does?

02:01:36.183 --> 02:01:38.365
To hear myself.

02:01:39.183 --> 02:01:41.365
To hear the way I want to treat you.

02:01:41.933 --> 02:01:44.699
I won't feel like this
a moment longer than I have to.

02:01:47.808 --> 02:01:50.416
But we can't just go like this.

02:01:50.516 --> 02:01:52.500
You'd be surprised.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:55.458
You're in love with
someone else. Is that it?

02:01:55.558 --> 02:01:57.791
No.

02:01:57.891 --> 02:01:59.750
Gone back to your wife?

02:01:59.850 --> 02:02:01.291
No, on the contrary...

02:02:01.391 --> 02:02:03.708
She wants to divorce me. She's found
someone else she wants to marry.

02:02:03.808 --> 02:02:06.958
- Well?
- Isn't that good news.

02:02:07.058 --> 02:02:09.250
But if there isn't anyone else,
what are you going to do?

02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:12.083
- Why just...
- I'm going to a small American university.

02:02:12.183 --> 02:02:14.666
I shall read, shall lecture...

02:02:14.766 --> 02:02:16.791
You'll hate it.

02:02:16.891 --> 02:02:20.125
...and I shall like it.
It's what I want to do. I shall write.

02:02:20.225 --> 02:02:22.708
What will you write about?

02:02:22.808 --> 02:02:25.541
I'll write about you.

02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:28.625
About myself, about my wife,
and my children.

02:02:28.725 --> 02:02:30.208
They played a large part, you know.

02:02:30.308 --> 02:02:35.407
- I played the largest part.
- Certainly the most dramatic.

02:02:39.475 --> 02:02:41.500
Robert, stop the car.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.458
I won't go to Rome.

02:02:43.558 --> 02:02:45.875
- You're going to Rome.
- I'll kill myself.

02:02:45.975 --> 02:02:48.041
- Then kill yourself.
- I will, I swear I will.

02:02:48.141 --> 02:02:50.324
So do.

02:02:51.766 --> 02:02:54.041
I didn't say I wanted to go with you.

02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:57.625
If I can't be with you,
I don't want to be alive.

02:02:57.725 --> 02:03:00.500
- Like hell.
- It's true.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:04.032
All lies are true at the time.

02:03:47.975 --> 02:03:49.532
Porter.

02:03:51.808 --> 02:03:53.365
Yes, ma'am?

02:03:54.433 --> 02:03:57.657
My suitcase is in the back.

02:04:16.183 --> 02:04:21.875
Announcing the arrival
of BOAC flight 262 from Lagos

02:04:21.975 --> 02:04:24.157
and Frankfurt.

02:04:26.508 --> 02:04:30.295
What actually is the
purpose of your visit here?

02:04:30.395 --> 02:04:32.750
Don't know how you even
found out I was in England.

02:04:32.850 --> 02:04:35.041
Any special reason?

02:04:35.141 --> 02:04:38.041
My mother hasn't been very well.
I came over to see her.

02:04:38.141 --> 02:04:40.000
No other reason?

02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:42.041
Isn't one's mother enough reason?

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:45.541
I see. Are you happy
in Italy, principessa?

02:04:45.641 --> 02:04:48.125
I'm as happy as anyone
could possibly be.

02:04:48.225 --> 02:04:52.375
Are you... likely to resume
your career soon, principessa?

02:04:52.475 --> 02:04:56.115
I have a family now and that
gives me all I could possible want.
