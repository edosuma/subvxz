WEBVTT

00:00.555 --> 00:03.222
(pensive music)

00:35.999 --> 00:38.666
(woman moaning)

00:41.735 --> 00:45.318
- [Woman] Oh fuck! (moans)

01:08.460 --> 01:09.377
Oh, my god.

01:10.223 --> 01:11.823
Fuck.

01:11.823 --> 01:13.406
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh.

01:15.722 --> 01:17.882
(rapid knocking)
- Yeah.

01:17.882 --> 01:20.531
- Dennis, are you almost done?

01:20.531 --> 01:22.443
- Just gimme one second.

01:22.443 --> 01:24.545
- [Katherine] Okay, I
need to get in there.

01:24.545 --> 01:25.378
- Okay.

01:28.602 --> 01:30.003
- [Narrator] It is difficult at the bottom

01:30.003 --> 01:32.066
of the food chain, but
luckily for the rabbit

01:32.066 --> 01:33.744
it's over quickly.

01:33.744 --> 01:35.642
- [Katherine] You know
it's all fake right?

01:35.642 --> 01:36.720
- [Narrator] An easy meal for the faster

01:36.720 --> 01:38.008
more powerful predator-

01:38.008 --> 01:38.966
- What?

01:38.966 --> 01:40.799
- Those documentaries.

01:41.809 --> 01:43.660
- It's all fake.

01:43.660 --> 01:44.770
It's all set up.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.050
- [Narrator] Nothing
more than sustenance of-

01:46.050 --> 01:47.383
- Yeah probably.

01:48.346 --> 01:50.644
I like to watch it anyway.

01:50.644 --> 01:54.626
- [Narrator] The pressure
moving on to find his next meal.

01:54.626 --> 01:56.386
It's unfortunate, but the rules of nature

01:56.386 --> 01:59.106
state it's survival of the fittest.

01:59.106 --> 02:01.844
- [Woman] (moaning) Oh, oh my god.

02:01.844 --> 02:05.011
Yeah, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck.

02:14.184 --> 02:15.434
- Hey neighbor.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.059
- Bill.

02:18.059 --> 02:18.892
Amy.

02:20.606 --> 02:23.023
- I'll see you tonight, okay?

02:24.215 --> 02:26.882
(pensive music)

02:40.916 --> 02:43.666
(car horn honks)

03:07.137 --> 03:08.637
- Morning, Stacy.

03:14.012 --> 03:16.179
(moaning)

03:17.906 --> 03:19.383
- Super behind today.

03:19.383 --> 03:20.786
I need these inputted into the system

03:20.786 --> 03:22.810
and scanned for errors by lunch.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.831
- Well, that's not really my job.

03:24.831 --> 03:26.463
- It's not?
- No.

03:26.463 --> 03:28.044
- Dennis, you don't
want to sit at this desk

03:28.044 --> 03:29.634
forever, right?

03:29.634 --> 03:30.467
- No.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.446
- Well, I'm the guy
who makes the decisions

03:32.446 --> 03:37.146
on who moves up and who
stays at little desk limbo.

03:37.146 --> 03:40.896
So uh, do me a solid,
you won't be forgotten.

03:58.858 --> 04:01.275
(soft music)

04:12.269 --> 04:14.436
(moaning)

04:17.019 --> 04:19.862
- I need somebody to stay
late and finish those up.

04:19.862 --> 04:21.527
- I can't.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.189
- What do you mean you can't?

04:23.189 --> 04:24.947
- Well isn't there somebody else

04:24.947 --> 04:25.841
that can do it?

04:25.841 --> 04:28.356
- Everybody else has plans.

04:28.356 --> 04:30.273
- What if I have plans?

04:33.327 --> 04:34.160
Okay.

04:35.183 --> 04:36.016
- Attaboy.

04:37.474 --> 04:39.391
Lock up when you leave.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.427
(soft music)

05:09.707 --> 05:11.831
- How was your day?

05:11.831 --> 05:13.373
- It was good.

05:13.373 --> 05:15.206
How was yours?
- Good.

05:18.127 --> 05:20.815
I got some paint samples
for the spare room

05:20.815 --> 05:23.154
if you want to look at them.

05:23.154 --> 05:25.215
- Whatever you're doing is okay with me.

05:25.215 --> 05:26.048
- Okay.

05:31.178 --> 05:34.311
Oh, the sink was backing up again.

05:34.311 --> 05:38.328
So I think I'm going to
call a plumber tomorrow.

05:38.328 --> 05:39.772
- You don't have to do that.

05:39.772 --> 05:40.689
I'll do it.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.970
- Are you sure?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.285
- Yeah.

05:45.285 --> 05:48.167
I'll take care of it this weekend.

05:48.167 --> 05:49.321
- Oh.

05:49.321 --> 05:50.154
Okay.

05:55.207 --> 05:56.610
- [Narrator] Every member of the pride

05:56.610 --> 05:58.448
enjoys the spoils of the hunt.

05:58.448 --> 05:59.844
But the rules of nature state

05:59.844 --> 06:02.021
that there is a feasting order.

06:02.021 --> 06:04.466
The alpha always eats first.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.048
No exceptions.

06:06.048 --> 06:08.730
It's a sign of dominance
over the rest of the pride.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.170
And any breaking that order is dealt

06:10.170 --> 06:12.468
with quickly and violently.

06:12.468 --> 06:15.710
Any pass given is considered
a sign of weakness.

06:15.710 --> 06:19.960
When he's eaten his full
only then will the others-

06:27.523 --> 06:28.395
- All right.

06:28.395 --> 06:29.978
I'm heading to bed.

06:30.898 --> 06:33.565
- Um, okay, maybe I'll join you.

06:34.612 --> 06:35.586
- Okay.

06:35.586 --> 06:36.419
- Okay.

06:53.951 --> 06:55.368
- Well goodnight.

06:56.612 --> 06:57.612
- Goodnight.

07:08.168 --> 07:10.571
(alarm rings)

07:10.571 --> 07:12.738
(moaning)

07:13.737 --> 07:14.987
- Hey neighbor.

07:17.898 --> 07:20.360
(moaning)

07:20.360 --> 07:21.503
- [Woman] So either we have dolls-

07:21.503 --> 07:23.154
(snoring)
(alarm rings)

07:23.154 --> 07:25.142
- [Woman] Oh my god.

07:25.142 --> 07:26.392
- Hey neighbor.

07:28.392 --> 07:30.398
(moaning)

07:30.398 --> 07:31.436
- [Woman] Just saying because I'm-

07:31.436 --> 07:32.496
(snoring)
(alarm rings)

07:32.496 --> 07:33.937
(moaning)

07:33.937 --> 07:35.187
- Hey neighbor.

07:36.923 --> 07:37.756
- Telling much-

07:37.756 --> 07:38.608
(snoring)
(alarm rings)

07:38.608 --> 07:39.858
- Hey neighbor.

07:40.844 --> 07:41.927
Hey neighbor.

07:43.148 --> 07:44.231
Hey neighbor.

07:45.445 --> 07:48.612
(cacophony of sounds)

07:54.047 --> 07:55.464
- Hey, what's up?

07:56.805 --> 07:59.181
- Oh, um, I-I-I'm, I'm sorry.

07:59.181 --> 08:01.864
I'll get you some more tomorrow, okay?

08:01.864 --> 08:04.805
- Well, what am I supposed to eat?

08:04.805 --> 08:06.587
- I don't know.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.027
Here, wait...

08:08.027 --> 08:10.900
You can have some toast, there you go.

08:10.900 --> 08:11.733
- Toast.

08:16.112 --> 08:17.445
- Hey, neighbor.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.602
- Bill.

08:19.602 --> 08:20.435
Amy.

08:20.435 --> 08:22.323
- Are we still on for
the barbecue tomorrow?

08:22.323 --> 08:25.071
- I don't know, I thin-
- Of course we're still on.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.022
Can't wait.

08:26.022 --> 08:26.855
- Great.

08:30.187 --> 08:31.104
- Love you.

08:32.903 --> 08:33.736
- Yeah.

08:35.351 --> 08:38.768
- Anything-
(alarm rings)

08:42.162 --> 08:44.426
- Do we really have to do this.

08:44.426 --> 08:45.259
- Come on.

08:46.862 --> 08:48.746
It's gonna be fun.

08:48.746 --> 08:49.920
- No it won't.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.167
You know, it won't.

08:52.167 --> 08:56.043
- Okay, we've lived here for how long now?

08:56.043 --> 08:59.493
And we don't even know these people.

08:59.493 --> 09:02.003
It's gonna be fun to make some friends.

09:02.003 --> 09:03.048
(doorbell rings)
Okay!

09:03.048 --> 09:07.131
I'll go get that and you
fire up the grill, okay?

09:10.031 --> 09:10.864
- Hey.

09:11.871 --> 09:13.268
Potato salad.

09:13.268 --> 09:15.202
- Oh, uh, h- hey guys.

09:15.202 --> 09:17.268
- Thank you so much for inviting us.

09:17.268 --> 09:18.831
It was so sweet of you.

09:18.831 --> 09:23.412
Look who I convinced to
hang out with the cool kids.

09:23.412 --> 09:24.602
- Hey Miss Breck.

09:24.602 --> 09:25.640
- Oh, uh.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.953
K-Katherine, please.

09:27.953 --> 09:29.622
- Katherine.

09:29.622 --> 09:31.372
- Mrs. Breck is fine.

09:33.646 --> 09:35.968
- Oh hey, don't press down on 'em,

09:35.968 --> 09:37.670
makes all the juices come out.

09:37.670 --> 09:40.070
And, uh, don't flip them
over and over either.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.352
That's a myth about the even seer.

09:42.352 --> 09:43.683
- Know how to cook a burger Bill.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.046
- Hey, I'm gonna be in
Europe all summer, okay.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.330
This might be the last decent burger I get

09:47.330 --> 09:49.934
for a while so I want it to be right.

09:49.934 --> 09:51.367
- The whole summer?

09:51.367 --> 09:55.409
- Yeah, yeah, we're not
getting any younger, right?

09:55.409 --> 09:57.089
I figure it's the right time.

09:57.089 --> 09:58.609
I had a couple good years financially,

09:58.609 --> 10:00.587
so I mean, I got the money, right?

10:00.587 --> 10:02.849
(laughs) You know, one of the best times

10:02.849 --> 10:04.722
I had in my life was this
backpacking trip I took

10:04.722 --> 10:06.246
when I was in college.

10:06.246 --> 10:09.748
Oh, (laughs) the women.

10:09.748 --> 10:11.748
And they love Americans.

10:16.985 --> 10:19.158
- So, you're the adventurous type?

10:19.158 --> 10:20.627
- Yeah, sure.

10:20.627 --> 10:21.794
Aren't we all?

10:23.726 --> 10:25.535
- Guess not.

10:25.535 --> 10:26.368
- What?

10:26.368 --> 10:29.285
You never wanted to try new things?

10:35.570 --> 10:36.403
- No.

10:38.142 --> 10:39.367
- Huh.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.666
Well you better get on it, buddy.

10:41.666 --> 10:43.833
Life is gonna pass you by.

10:47.770 --> 10:49.466
- So, Conner, are you looking forward

10:49.466 --> 10:50.921
to your trip?

10:50.921 --> 10:53.121
- Yeah, I'm not going.

10:53.121 --> 10:54.250
- No.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.122
- No.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.647
He's headed to college in a couple years.

10:56.647 --> 10:57.847
So I figure it's time
for him to have a little

10:57.847 --> 10:59.807
responsibility, you know?

10:59.807 --> 11:00.923
He's earned it.

11:00.923 --> 11:02.016
- Oh, yeah.

11:02.016 --> 11:03.191
- Yeah.

11:03.191 --> 11:07.219
4.0 GPA, top rank wrestler
in his class, right?

11:07.219 --> 11:08.248
Class President.

11:08.248 --> 11:09.545
I mean, you tell me.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.771
The kid is perfect.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.365
Schools are breaking
down the doors already.

11:14.365 --> 11:16.264
He's gonna be a leader of men someday.

11:16.264 --> 11:17.442
- Yeah.

11:17.442 --> 11:19.805
- Hey, and, uh, Amy and
I would appreciate it

11:19.805 --> 11:21.417
if you keep an eye on him
more while we're gone.

11:21.417 --> 11:22.904
Maybe just poke your head and once

11:22.904 --> 11:24.751
in a while, make sure he
hasn't burned the house down.

11:24.751 --> 11:25.584
- Sure.

11:28.052 --> 11:30.044
- So if you ever come
over and hang out like

11:30.044 --> 11:32.366
video games, whatever.

11:32.366 --> 11:33.949
Door's always open.

11:35.972 --> 11:36.805
- Thanks?

11:39.070 --> 11:41.320
- So you need another beer?

11:42.950 --> 11:45.617
- Don't ask me stupid questions.

11:50.654 --> 11:53.404
(rapid knocking)

11:56.528 --> 11:57.584
- Hi.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.251
Is, uh, Conner here.

12:01.226 --> 12:02.300
- Who?

12:02.300 --> 12:03.406
- Conner.

12:03.406 --> 12:04.573
He invited me.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.224
- Oh, Conner.

12:08.224 --> 12:09.867
Yeah, Conner.

12:09.867 --> 12:10.920
Come on in.

12:10.920 --> 12:11.753
- Okay.

12:14.448 --> 12:15.778
Conner?

12:15.778 --> 12:16.861
- Yeah, Tara.

12:19.139 --> 12:19.972
- Nice.

12:25.515 --> 12:27.061
- Can I get you a soda or something?

12:27.061 --> 12:29.125
There's burgers, they're almost done.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.458
- No, thank you.

12:35.304 --> 12:36.137
- Well.

12:40.076 --> 12:42.465
- Yeah, I mean, the uh,
the beaches in Europe

12:42.465 --> 12:44.303
are glorious, you know, the girls

12:44.303 --> 12:45.636
are all topless.

12:46.528 --> 12:47.519
You'd kill it.

12:47.519 --> 12:49.121
- (laughs) Oh my God.

12:49.121 --> 12:51.121
- Burgers are done, I got it.

12:51.121 --> 12:51.954
- What?

12:54.524 --> 12:56.385
- Who's that?
- Huh?

12:56.385 --> 12:58.625
Oh, friend of Conner's.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.400
I don't know.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.523
- Oh.

13:01.523 --> 13:02.440
She's cute.

13:03.885 --> 13:05.302
- Is she?
- Yeah.

13:06.403 --> 13:07.236
Lucky guy.

13:13.029 --> 13:13.862
- I guess.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.962
- So you're starting to remodel?

13:17.962 --> 13:19.067
That's so fun.

13:19.067 --> 13:21.484
(soft music)

13:35.682 --> 13:38.253
- What do you think of that, Dennis?

13:38.253 --> 13:39.416
- Huh?

13:39.416 --> 13:40.249
What?

13:42.543 --> 13:43.876
- Hi, Mr. Breck.

13:45.503 --> 13:46.336
- Dennis.

13:47.241 --> 13:50.541
What's all this Mr. Breck stuff?

13:50.541 --> 13:52.517
- Okay, Dennis.

13:52.517 --> 13:55.801
Do you mind if I go in the
house and use the restroom?

13:55.801 --> 13:56.716
- Yeah, yeah.

13:56.716 --> 13:57.974
Make yourself at home.

13:57.974 --> 13:59.974
Just, of course.

13:59.974 --> 14:04.141
- I just didn't want to
assume I could just go in.

14:09.874 --> 14:11.162
- Let me help you.

14:11.162 --> 14:12.177
- No, that's okay.

14:12.177 --> 14:14.474
- No, it's my pleasure.

14:14.474 --> 14:16.057
- Um, okay, thanks.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.645
So, Tara was pretty nice.

14:26.205 --> 14:28.205
Is she a girlfriend, or?

14:29.943 --> 14:31.362
- I just met her today.

14:31.362 --> 14:32.821
- Really?

14:32.821 --> 14:35.480
You guys seem pretty familiar already.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.313
- It's why she's here.

14:38.605 --> 14:39.438
- What?

14:41.482 --> 14:44.181
- I met her on the Hook'dUp app.

14:44.181 --> 14:46.348
- What's the Hook'dUp app?

14:47.618 --> 14:51.821
- See there's this app,
just upload a photo

14:51.821 --> 14:54.875
of yourself and description
of what you're looking for.

14:54.875 --> 14:58.274
Your girl likes what she sees, she just...

14:58.274 --> 14:59.589
You know...

14:59.589 --> 15:00.619
- Like fuck?

15:00.619 --> 15:03.632
- Yeah, basically, no strings attached.

15:03.632 --> 15:04.965
Just hooking up.

15:06.557 --> 15:09.008
- This can't be real.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.425
- It's very real.

15:11.817 --> 15:15.984
- Well, what about like,
dating and relationships?

15:16.850 --> 15:18.514
You know, making a connection?

15:18.514 --> 15:20.735
Aren't you interested
in something like that?

15:20.735 --> 15:22.653
- Yeah, maybe someday.

15:22.653 --> 15:26.820
But for now, girls are
looking for the same thing.

15:28.321 --> 15:30.689
Why waste time with anything else?

15:30.689 --> 15:34.356
Plus, it's better than
watching porn, right?

15:37.308 --> 15:38.910
- You know what? Call me old fashioned,

15:38.910 --> 15:42.529
but maybe I want to know the
person sleeping with, you know,

15:42.529 --> 15:45.482
I couldn't just hook up with a stranger.

15:45.482 --> 15:47.931
- Have you ever tried it?

15:47.931 --> 15:49.006
- No.

15:49.006 --> 15:51.621
- Well then you don't know
what you're capable of.

15:51.621 --> 15:55.909
We're basically just
animals: eat, fuck and fight.

15:55.909 --> 15:58.286
It's all we know how to do.

15:58.286 --> 16:01.281
- It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

16:01.281 --> 16:04.047
- Maybe, but I haven't seen it.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.949
It's purely physical
and just sex after all.

16:06.949 --> 16:09.170
And there's no love to it or anything.

16:09.170 --> 16:10.837
It's not a big deal.

16:12.485 --> 16:13.922
- What are you, like, 12?

16:13.922 --> 16:17.127
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

16:17.127 --> 16:18.877
- Hey, are you ready?

16:21.363 --> 16:23.804
- You're probably right.

16:23.804 --> 16:26.804
I don't know what I'm talking about.

16:42.623 --> 16:44.456
- What's your problem?

16:45.723 --> 16:48.160
- It's just that little punk kid,

16:48.160 --> 16:50.285
what's his name, Conrad.

16:50.285 --> 16:52.360
- Conner?
- Yeah.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.265
You know, like, try to be cool.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.363
Try to be his friend.

16:57.363 --> 16:58.635
He's just so smug.

16:58.635 --> 16:59.763
You know?

16:59.763 --> 17:02.360
So arrogant, it's irritating.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.502
- Really?

17:03.502 --> 17:06.637
The son of the world's
most perfect parents.

17:06.637 --> 17:09.401
I find that hard to believe.

17:09.401 --> 17:10.599
- Well you should have
heard some of the things

17:10.599 --> 17:12.400
he was saying.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
- Like what?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.955
- Just never mind.

17:16.955 --> 17:20.559
Okay, but let's just say that
I should have popped him one.

17:20.559 --> 17:21.392
- Okay.

17:23.524 --> 17:25.341
Well, can you...

17:25.341 --> 17:28.652
Can you pop this back over to Amy for me?

17:28.652 --> 17:29.901
- I'm serious.

17:29.901 --> 17:31.539
One punch, That's all I'd need,

17:31.539 --> 17:33.039
I'd knock him out.

17:54.635 --> 17:57.135
(woman moans)

18:32.790 --> 18:35.290
(tense music)

19:22.763 --> 19:25.013
(grunting)

19:40.603 --> 19:41.891
- Oh, ow, ow, ow.

19:41.891 --> 19:42.739
- Oh, what's that.

19:42.739 --> 19:43.572
You okay?

19:43.572 --> 19:44.963
- No, no it's okay, it's okay.

19:44.963 --> 19:46.046
- Okay, okay.

20:06.522 --> 20:09.025
- Are, are you almost done?

20:09.025 --> 20:10.224
- Yeah.

20:10.224 --> 20:12.391
(moaning)

20:16.984 --> 20:19.635
(alarm beeping)

20:19.635 --> 20:21.543
- [Woman] Oh my God.

20:21.543 --> 20:24.210
(pensive music)

21:59.367 --> 22:00.643
- This is stupid.

22:00.643 --> 22:04.643
- Hey, do you have a copy
of the matrix reports?

22:06.287 --> 22:08.454
- Oh, uh, yeah, of course.

22:10.364 --> 22:12.030
- Thanks. Can you give
me a hand with these?

22:12.030 --> 22:14.027
I'm having trouble inputting them.

22:14.027 --> 22:15.527
- Yeah, of course.

22:53.412 --> 22:54.995
What are you doing?

23:23.571 --> 23:26.738
- Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

23:47.430 --> 23:48.263
- Dammit.

23:55.569 --> 23:56.566
Oh hey!

23:56.566 --> 23:58.183
- Hey.

23:58.183 --> 23:59.962
Hey, did you get the mail,

23:59.962 --> 24:01.124
I'm gonna go check the mail.

24:01.124 --> 24:02.546
I need to check the mail.

24:02.546 --> 24:05.382
- No, wait, wait, wait,
first can you, uh...

24:05.382 --> 24:07.382
(sighs)

24:21.937 --> 24:24.604
(phone buzzing)

24:57.036 --> 24:59.536
(tense music)

25:12.254 --> 25:15.004
(car horn honks)

25:30.756 --> 25:31.589
- What?

25:31.589 --> 25:32.589
- Who's Eva?

25:34.291 --> 25:35.124
- Dennis?

25:36.729 --> 25:37.562
Dennis?

25:40.292 --> 25:42.125
Are you still with us?

25:44.075 --> 25:45.508
- Yeah.

25:45.508 --> 25:50.175
- We were talking about the
sex app that you downloaded.

25:51.434 --> 25:52.267
- Yeah.

25:53.434 --> 25:56.017
- Do you want to talk about it?

25:59.274 --> 26:01.186
- I was just curious.

26:01.186 --> 26:02.019
That's it.

26:02.987 --> 26:05.654
I never cheated on you, I swear.

26:08.431 --> 26:13.014
- [Therapist] Then why did
you download the app at all?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.999
- We've been married
for a little while now

26:18.999 --> 26:20.416
and things aren't

26:24.649 --> 26:26.066
exciting anymore.

26:28.114 --> 26:31.017
When we first got married, right?

26:31.017 --> 26:33.879
I mean, it was like I hit the jackpot.

26:33.879 --> 26:36.462
I mean, look, she was beautiful

26:37.614 --> 26:40.781
and she was young and she was into me.

26:43.841 --> 26:45.538
I mean, I couldn't believe it,

26:45.538 --> 26:47.871
I don't get lucky like that.

26:52.113 --> 26:56.113
But now it's like she
doesn't even care anymore.

26:58.391 --> 27:01.674
There's a whole world out there.

27:01.674 --> 27:03.007
Just wild stuff.

27:04.408 --> 27:05.591
Crazy stuff.

27:05.591 --> 27:07.011
Crazy sex stuff.

27:07.011 --> 27:11.928
I mean, it's all over the place
and our sex life is just...

27:13.297 --> 27:16.630
Well, I feel like I'm missing something.

27:17.798 --> 27:21.623
We never do it anymore, and when we do

27:21.623 --> 27:23.194
it's like you're bored.

27:23.194 --> 27:25.063
I mean, do you even like it?

27:25.063 --> 27:26.496
- Sometimes.

27:26.496 --> 27:29.086
- You don't act like it.

27:29.086 --> 27:31.816
- Real girls don't have screaming orgasms

27:31.816 --> 27:33.823
like the ones in your videos.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.479
You don't think I know what you're doing

27:35.479 --> 27:36.976
in the bathroom every morning.

27:36.976 --> 27:38.498
God, you spend more
time in there than I do.

27:38.498 --> 27:40.213
- Well, you know what,
it doesn't take a lot

27:40.213 --> 27:42.541
of time to not do your hair and makeup.

27:42.541 --> 27:43.552
- Okay, okay.

27:43.552 --> 27:48.219
Well, why don't we just take
a little breath here, okay?

27:50.036 --> 27:53.119
So, Dennis, do you watch pornography?

27:56.021 --> 27:56.854
- Yes.

27:57.800 --> 28:02.133
- What is it that compels
you to watch these movies?

28:05.219 --> 28:06.636
- It's a release.

28:09.261 --> 28:11.261
Because it's satisfying.

28:13.415 --> 28:15.122
Because it's sexy.

28:15.122 --> 28:17.955
God I wish I could fuck like that.

28:19.786 --> 28:20.786
- Like what?

28:23.589 --> 28:24.506
- Savagely.

28:26.221 --> 28:29.464
You know, without consequences.

28:29.464 --> 28:31.297
Just nobody gets hurt.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.246
I mean, everybody's satisfied.

28:38.090 --> 28:39.173
It's perfect.

28:40.225 --> 28:41.725
It's amazing.

28:41.725 --> 28:43.749
You can have anything you want,

28:43.749 --> 28:46.047
right when you want it.

28:46.047 --> 28:50.389
When I'm watching those
movies, it's like I'm,

28:50.389 --> 28:54.524
it's like I'm watching
everything that I will never be.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.941
- And you can't have that with Katherine?

28:59.665 --> 29:02.063
Did you know that he felt this way?

29:02.063 --> 29:03.186
- No.

29:03.186 --> 29:05.839
- So clearly, this is not a sex issue.

29:05.839 --> 29:09.127
This is a communications issue.

29:09.127 --> 29:11.788
It can be really hard
to express your needs

29:11.788 --> 29:13.139
to someone that you love.

29:13.139 --> 29:16.327
It can make you feel vulnerable.

29:16.327 --> 29:18.566
I mean, once it's out there,

29:18.566 --> 29:20.739
it's hard to take it back.

29:20.739 --> 29:21.572
- Exactly.

29:23.164 --> 29:26.747
- So I have something
that just might help.

29:33.788 --> 29:37.289
What I want you to do
is write down a fantasy,

29:37.289 --> 29:38.289
each of you.

29:44.066 --> 29:46.399
Keep it simple, start small.

29:53.352 --> 29:54.602
Put it in a box

30:01.948 --> 30:04.031
and blindly pull one out.

30:27.263 --> 30:28.725
- Jesus.

30:28.725 --> 30:30.359
- Oh, this...

30:30.359 --> 30:33.359
- No, no, no, don't, don't cover up.

30:35.638 --> 30:37.112
You look amazing.

30:37.112 --> 30:37.945
- Really?

30:45.636 --> 30:47.803
(panting)

30:54.908 --> 30:57.241
- Come on, come on, come on.

30:58.926 --> 30:59.759
Come on.

31:08.907 --> 31:09.740
Dammit.

31:12.155 --> 31:14.020
- Wait, what...

31:14.020 --> 31:15.103
What's wrong?

31:23.350 --> 31:25.789
- I thought it'd be different, you know,

31:25.789 --> 31:27.872
you dressed up like that.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.588
But it's the same.

31:31.787 --> 31:33.954
It's always just the same.

31:45.711 --> 31:47.294
It's not you, okay?

31:48.875 --> 31:49.708
I just.

31:51.352 --> 31:54.675
I mean, maybe I just built
it too big in my mind.

31:54.675 --> 31:58.842
I just wanted something
crazy and wild and just...

32:01.164 --> 32:04.081
I'm the one who fucked up, not you.

32:05.101 --> 32:06.934
- What does that mean?

32:08.377 --> 32:10.627
- I don't know, just maybe,

32:12.514 --> 32:14.291
maybe we're just not the kind of people

32:14.291 --> 32:16.322
that are meant for this kind of thing.

32:16.322 --> 32:17.905
Maybe we're just...

32:19.529 --> 32:20.362
boring.

32:26.614 --> 32:27.447
- No.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.113
- What?

32:32.480 --> 32:34.063
What are you doing?

32:36.219 --> 32:40.636
- Are you telling me that
I married a boring quitter?

32:42.051 --> 32:44.243
Okay, no, no, no.

32:44.243 --> 32:47.826
If that's you, then
what does that make me?

32:49.454 --> 32:51.019
- I didn't mean you.

32:51.019 --> 32:51.852
- Listen.

32:53.616 --> 32:56.699
I'm not old and I'm not boring, okay?

32:59.878 --> 33:02.418
- What are you doing?
- We're not boring.

33:02.418 --> 33:03.749
Say it.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.015
Say we're not boring.

33:05.015 --> 33:06.214
- We're not boring.

33:06.214 --> 33:07.735
- I don't believe you.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.318
- We're not boring.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.792
- Oh, hello, somebody's back.

33:15.836 --> 33:16.669
- Yeah.

33:21.491 --> 33:22.824
Yeah, that's it.

33:23.832 --> 33:25.249
Harder.
- Harder?

33:26.136 --> 33:27.009
- Harder.

33:27.009 --> 33:28.592
As hard as you can.

33:29.813 --> 33:34.813
(coughs) No, don't stop, don't
stop, no, don't, don't stop.

33:35.115 --> 33:36.757
Wait, no, no, no don't stop.

33:36.757 --> 33:38.075
Don't stop.

33:38.075 --> 33:38.908
Wait.

33:44.632 --> 33:45.465
Use this.

33:47.934 --> 33:48.767
Do it.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.527
Go, go.

33:51.637 --> 33:53.887
(groaning)

34:06.673 --> 34:09.256
- Babe, babe, wake up, wake up!

34:10.615 --> 34:12.650
(gasps)

34:12.650 --> 34:13.733
Are you okay?

34:16.045 --> 34:16.878
- Yeah.

34:23.777 --> 34:24.777
Do it again.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.325
(laughs)

- What is that?

36:12.368 --> 36:13.948
It smells amazing.

36:13.948 --> 36:15.115
- It's goetta.

36:16.676 --> 36:18.259
- And what is that?

36:20.092 --> 36:23.396
- I don't know, we
haven't tried it before.

36:23.396 --> 36:24.729
- Oh, you fancy.

36:26.341 --> 36:28.591
(giggling)

36:39.237 --> 36:40.597
- Hey, Dennis.

36:40.597 --> 36:42.150
Looking good, today.

36:42.150 --> 36:44.817
Do something new with your hair?

36:46.081 --> 36:49.842
- Actually, I've been working out lately.

36:49.842 --> 36:50.759
Like a lot.

36:52.154 --> 36:54.063
- Well, keep it up.

36:54.063 --> 36:54.896
- Plan to.

36:58.937 --> 36:59.770
- Stacey.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.240
Get in here.

37:03.372 --> 37:05.789
- I got to go deal with that.

37:34.238 --> 37:36.100
- Are you, are you sure
there's no one here?

37:36.100 --> 37:37.415
- Yes, I'm sure.

37:37.415 --> 37:38.248
Here.

37:44.121 --> 37:45.288
Let's do this.

37:51.081 --> 37:51.953
- Yes.

37:51.953 --> 37:54.953
Can you step into my office, please?

38:01.753 --> 38:04.003
- You wanted to see me sir.

38:06.681 --> 38:09.979
- Yeah, I've been going
over your work here

38:09.979 --> 38:11.812
and it's unacceptable.

38:12.789 --> 38:15.176
- Oh, no, I'm so sorry, sir.

38:15.176 --> 38:17.314
I did the best that I could.

38:17.314 --> 38:18.674
- Well, I'm afraid that
the best that you could

38:18.674 --> 38:20.555
isn't good enough.

38:20.555 --> 38:23.058
I'm gonna have to fire you.

38:23.058 --> 38:25.677
- Oh, please, please don't fire me, sir.

38:25.677 --> 38:28.344
Is there anything that I can do?

38:29.277 --> 38:30.251
- I'm sorry.

38:30.251 --> 38:32.914
Nothing I can think of.

38:32.914 --> 38:33.997
You're fired.

38:35.074 --> 38:38.407
- There's nothing that you can think of?

38:41.857 --> 38:44.107
- There might be something.

38:47.481 --> 38:49.648
(panting)

38:54.818 --> 38:55.735
Shit, shit!

39:08.117 --> 39:09.317
- You said that no one was here.

39:09.317 --> 39:10.150
- Shush.

39:16.901 --> 39:18.294
Shh, shh!

39:18.294 --> 39:20.794
(tense music)

39:25.034 --> 39:27.201
(moaning)

39:47.853 --> 39:49.931
- Man, what the hell
are you doing back here?

39:49.931 --> 39:51.891
- I thought I saw some lights
on it came to check it out.

39:51.891 --> 39:56.224
- Yeah, ain't nothing
happening back here, let's go.

40:15.989 --> 40:17.691
- Well somebody was in here,

40:17.691 --> 40:21.392
there wasn't a fucking
tornado in my office.

40:21.392 --> 40:22.851
Proof?

40:22.851 --> 40:24.851
I'm looking right at it.

40:25.903 --> 40:27.027
Yeah?

40:27.027 --> 40:31.860
Well maybe you should get
better security guards, asshole.

40:39.965 --> 40:41.339
- Hey, Dennis, I'm gonna
need you to take care

40:41.339 --> 40:44.587
of this for me today,
I'm just not up for it.

40:44.587 --> 40:45.420
- No.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.560
- Excuse me?

40:53.181 --> 40:54.771
- No.

40:54.771 --> 40:58.891
Got my own stuff to do, I
can't be carrying you too.

40:58.891 --> 41:01.974
- Please, you couldn't handle my job.

41:02.842 --> 41:03.675
- What?

41:04.877 --> 41:06.535
Playing with my phone all day,

41:06.535 --> 41:10.328
pushing my work onto everybody else?

41:10.328 --> 41:12.375
I can handle your job.

41:12.375 --> 41:13.473
- Well.

41:13.473 --> 41:16.390
What if I was to write you up, huh?

41:17.777 --> 41:20.177
What if I was to fire you?

41:20.177 --> 41:21.094
- For what?

41:27.137 --> 41:28.637
- Insubordination.

41:30.433 --> 41:31.933
- Insubordination?

41:34.214 --> 41:38.739
You file that report with
HR and you explain to them

41:38.739 --> 41:40.675
why I'm being insubordinate

41:40.675 --> 41:43.282
for not doing your fucking job.

41:43.282 --> 41:45.782
(phone rings)

41:49.818 --> 41:51.068
- Back to work.

41:51.917 --> 41:54.479
- It was like something out of a movie.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.317
I'm so worked up right now,

41:56.317 --> 41:57.839
can you feel my heart beating?

41:57.839 --> 41:59.279
I just wanna...

41:59.279 --> 42:00.615
Here, come on, let's do something out

42:00.615 --> 42:04.718
of the fantasy box right
now, something wild.

42:04.718 --> 42:05.551
- Um, now?

42:08.318 --> 42:09.618
I was thinking we could slow it down

42:09.618 --> 42:11.178
for a little bit.

42:11.178 --> 42:12.581
- Slow it down?

42:12.581 --> 42:14.079
Slowing it down is the exact opposite

42:14.079 --> 42:16.354
of what we should be doing right now.

42:16.354 --> 42:17.918
I've never felt like this before.

42:17.918 --> 42:19.781
I don't wanna stop now.

42:19.781 --> 42:24.198
This is when we push it,
push it as far as it can.

42:24.198 --> 42:28.315
I'm wanna drive this
car off a fucking cliff.

42:28.315 --> 42:29.648
No consequences.

42:37.397 --> 42:38.480
- Hey Conner.

42:41.477 --> 42:43.392
- Uh, hey Mr. Breck.

42:43.392 --> 42:45.477
- I'm sorry I haven't stopped by lately,

42:45.477 --> 42:48.115
you know, I told your dad
that I'd be looking after you.

42:48.115 --> 42:50.154
- It's all good, I don't
need anyone to look after me.

42:50.154 --> 42:51.774
- No, I know that, I don't think

42:51.774 --> 42:53.475
you're a child, I just
didn't want you to think

42:53.475 --> 42:55.118
that I had abandoned you, that's it.

42:55.118 --> 42:56.115
- It's all cool, really.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.235
- Okay.

42:57.235 --> 42:59.583
You know what, why don't you
come over this afternoon.

42:59.583 --> 43:01.613
Yeah, we'll order out, it'll be great.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.476
- I can't, I've got plans.

43:03.476 --> 43:05.643
- Oh, well that's too bad.

43:06.814 --> 43:09.613
- Actually, I know my parents asked you

43:09.613 --> 43:12.575
to check in on me and all,
but I was gonna invite

43:12.575 --> 43:14.975
a couple friends over tomorrow night.

43:14.975 --> 43:16.276
- You mean like a party?

43:16.276 --> 43:19.303
- Not a party, just like
a couple close friends

43:19.303 --> 43:21.553
just hanging out, you know?

43:22.938 --> 43:25.214
I figured you'd be cool with it.

43:25.214 --> 43:27.274
- Oh, yeah, I'm cool with it, yeah I'm,

43:27.274 --> 43:29.734
I'm cool with it, I'm-
- Awesome.

43:29.734 --> 43:31.254
Just don't want anyone
calling the cops on me

43:31.254 --> 43:32.771
or anything, you know.

43:32.771 --> 43:33.604
- Yeah.

43:33.604 --> 43:35.074
- I don't wanna ruin my parents' vacation.

43:35.074 --> 43:36.071
- Yeah.

43:36.071 --> 43:39.252
I know, some of the
neighbors are kinda lame.

43:39.252 --> 43:41.584
Listen, have it at my house?

43:41.584 --> 43:42.417
- What?

43:42.417 --> 43:43.930
- Yeah, we'll use the
pool, we'll grill out,

43:43.930 --> 43:45.318
it'll be perfect.

43:45.318 --> 43:46.371
- Really?
- Yeah!

43:46.371 --> 43:48.646
That way I can keep an eye on you,

43:48.646 --> 43:49.891
you know what I mean, no one's gonna call

43:49.891 --> 43:51.296
the cops at my house.

43:51.296 --> 43:55.160
- Um, I don't know, I just don't want

43:55.160 --> 43:57.887
to be like an inconvenience
to you all or anything, uh.

43:57.887 --> 43:59.360
- What are you talking about?
- Are you sure Mrs. Breck's

43:59.360 --> 44:00.710
cool with it?

44:00.710 --> 44:02.173
- What, Katherine?

44:02.173 --> 44:04.511
(scoffs) Katherine is cool with it, man.

44:04.511 --> 44:07.695
- Uh.
- You know what, I insist.

44:07.695 --> 44:09.332
Yeah, if you've having the party,

44:09.332 --> 44:11.749
you're having it at my house.

44:13.069 --> 44:14.842
- Uh, okay I guess.

44:14.842 --> 44:15.848
- All right!

44:15.848 --> 44:16.681
- Thanks.
- Sure.

44:16.681 --> 44:19.681
Hey, it's better this way, trust me.

44:20.651 --> 44:23.234
(upbeat music)

44:51.886 --> 44:53.350
- Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on,

44:53.350 --> 44:54.627
you need to relax.

44:54.627 --> 44:55.850
- How am I supposed to relax,

44:55.850 --> 44:57.051
there are children drinking alcohol

44:57.051 --> 44:58.499
at my house right now.

44:58.499 --> 44:59.499
- Like this.

45:02.345 --> 45:04.070
What, have you run out of fun?

45:04.070 --> 45:06.403
- No, no, I don't.
- Come one, just one shot.

45:06.403 --> 45:07.236
Please?

45:14.048 --> 45:15.548
Come on, one more.

45:16.506 --> 45:19.339
One more, one more, just one more.

45:24.463 --> 45:25.296
See?

45:31.153 --> 45:33.736
(upbeat music)

45:38.475 --> 45:39.392
- I just...

45:40.250 --> 45:41.500
Tara, you came.

45:43.497 --> 45:45.275
- Yeah, well, after
Conner told me that you

45:45.275 --> 45:48.672
personally extended your invitation,

45:48.672 --> 45:50.255
how could I say no?

45:54.450 --> 45:57.314
- Uh, come in, there's food and drinks,

45:57.314 --> 45:59.564
just make yourself at home.

46:05.751 --> 46:07.025
- You all right?

46:07.025 --> 46:08.413
- Huh?

46:08.413 --> 46:09.526
- Are you all right?

46:09.526 --> 46:11.314
You looked a little stressed out.

46:11.314 --> 46:13.397
- Oh, is it that obvious?

46:15.752 --> 46:17.949
- Look, I can get all
these people out of here

46:17.949 --> 46:19.277
if that's what you want.

46:19.277 --> 46:22.477
- Oh, no, that's, that's not necessary.

46:22.477 --> 46:23.310
- You sure?

46:23.310 --> 46:24.387
It's not a problem.

46:24.387 --> 46:25.390
- Yeah.

46:25.390 --> 46:28.890
I mean Dennis is having fun, so it's fine.

46:32.311 --> 46:34.151
- What about you?

46:34.151 --> 46:35.484
- What about me?

46:36.528 --> 46:37.945
- You having fun?

46:40.128 --> 46:41.295
- Not exactly.

46:45.329 --> 46:46.829
- Yeah, me either.

46:51.676 --> 46:53.550
- Aren't these your friends.

46:53.550 --> 46:54.383
- What?

46:54.383 --> 46:56.383
I thought you knew them.

46:58.578 --> 47:00.981
You know, you're allowed to enjoy yourself

47:00.981 --> 47:02.814
every once in a while.

47:03.941 --> 47:05.191
- Oh, I-I know.

47:06.341 --> 47:09.237
I've just had a lot on my mind lately.

47:09.237 --> 47:10.237
- Like what?

47:13.218 --> 47:15.159
- You don't wanna know.

47:15.159 --> 47:15.992
- Okay.

47:17.321 --> 47:18.154
Well...

47:22.218 --> 47:25.484
Tell me something I do wanna know.

47:25.484 --> 47:26.484
- Like what?

47:27.775 --> 47:30.493
- I don't know, anything.

47:30.493 --> 47:31.993
Whatever you want.

47:35.716 --> 47:39.549
- Did Dennis send you
over here to talk to me?

47:41.119 --> 47:42.083
- No.

47:42.083 --> 47:44.519
Why would he do that?

47:44.519 --> 47:45.519
- Nevermind.

47:48.568 --> 47:50.683
- Wait, you've telling me
that you're a cheerleader?

47:50.683 --> 47:51.516
Really?

47:51.516 --> 47:54.292
- What about that is so hard to believe?

47:54.292 --> 47:56.375
- I don't know, I just...

47:57.335 --> 48:00.668
Cheerleaders always just seem so prissy.

48:01.961 --> 48:02.794
- Really?

48:08.319 --> 48:10.559
- I'm glad you came.

48:10.559 --> 48:13.014
I didn't think I was gonna
get to see you again.

48:13.014 --> 48:14.499
- Yeah, well, from what I've heard,

48:14.499 --> 48:16.263
you've seen quite a bit of me.

48:16.263 --> 48:19.625
No, no, no it's okay,
really it's, it's fine,

48:19.625 --> 48:21.202
I kind of liked it.

48:21.202 --> 48:22.074
- Really?

48:22.074 --> 48:25.601
- I mean, yeah, I've
never done that before,

48:25.601 --> 48:28.400
you know, have somebody watch me.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.983
Chalk it up to new experiences.

48:32.188 --> 48:34.140
- Gotta keep it fresh.

48:34.140 --> 48:36.724
- It was definitely hot though.

48:36.724 --> 48:38.402
Being watched.

48:38.402 --> 48:39.524
- Really?

48:39.524 --> 48:42.525
- Like, yeah, I can add it to my profile.

48:42.525 --> 48:43.692
Exhibitionist.

48:45.561 --> 48:47.164
Well, you see there's this app...

48:47.164 --> 48:48.859
- Oh, I-I know about the app.

48:48.859 --> 48:49.796
- You do?

48:49.796 --> 48:52.546
- Yeah, I uh, I signed up for it.

48:55.383 --> 48:56.716
- You scoundrel.

48:57.633 --> 48:58.466
- Yeah.

48:59.350 --> 49:01.477
- Wait, does-does Katherine know?

49:01.477 --> 49:03.477
- Yeah, hey, we're cool.

49:05.215 --> 49:09.465
You know, I mean, we're
married but we still party.

49:10.889 --> 49:11.889
- Lucky dog.

49:15.712 --> 49:18.126
- Graduation's a couple years away.

49:18.126 --> 49:20.411
- Well that, that's exciting.

49:20.411 --> 49:22.792
- I guess, I mean it
would be nice to finally

49:22.792 --> 49:25.813
get out of here, I just
don't know what I want

49:25.813 --> 49:27.587
to do with my life.

49:27.587 --> 49:32.151
- Well, you know, I
graduated many years ago now

49:32.151 --> 49:34.652
and I still don't know what I wanna

49:34.652 --> 49:37.790
do with my life either,
but that's life, though,

49:37.790 --> 49:40.175
you know, you just try new
things and if you don't like it

49:40.175 --> 49:42.891
you can move on to something else, or...

49:42.891 --> 49:46.091
- Yeah, like, my dad wants me

49:46.091 --> 49:49.091
to go to college of course, but why?

49:50.816 --> 49:52.201
What's the point?

49:52.201 --> 49:53.753
Everyone goes to college.

49:53.753 --> 49:55.799
- But you have to go to college.

49:55.799 --> 49:57.143
- Why?

49:57.143 --> 49:58.546
You went to college, right?

49:58.546 --> 49:59.418
- Yes.

49:59.418 --> 50:01.943
- What did you study?

50:01.943 --> 50:03.562
- Social work.

50:03.562 --> 50:04.927
- Why?

50:04.927 --> 50:08.544
- Because I wanted to help people.

50:08.544 --> 50:10.377
- See, that's awesome.

50:12.280 --> 50:14.082
I wanna make a difference too,

50:14.082 --> 50:15.829
you know, I don't wanna be locked down

50:15.829 --> 50:19.386
in some job that I hate
forever or obsess about things

50:19.386 --> 50:21.469
like my house or my lawn.

50:24.769 --> 50:28.019
- Well, what do you have in mind, then?

50:30.125 --> 50:34.274
- I was thinking about
joining the peace corps.

50:34.274 --> 50:36.857
- Oh, that-that's so admirable.

50:39.122 --> 50:41.323
I mean, it's actually really nice hearing

50:41.323 --> 50:44.343
someone your age thinking about more

50:44.343 --> 50:47.926
than, like, likes and
followers and shares.

50:50.222 --> 50:51.055
Yeah.

50:52.223 --> 50:53.056
It's cool.

50:55.762 --> 50:57.902
- Well, I think you're cool.

50:57.902 --> 50:58.859
- Oh.

50:58.859 --> 51:00.723
- Seriously, seriously, hey,

51:00.723 --> 51:04.556
I can't talk like this
in front of my friends.

51:07.173 --> 51:10.756
- Okay, um, well, I
need another drink, so.

51:16.393 --> 51:18.353
- This is fun.

51:18.353 --> 51:19.562
I'm glad you came.

51:19.562 --> 51:20.395
- Me too.

51:21.824 --> 51:23.859
- So you're good to drive, right?

51:23.859 --> 51:25.260
Cause you could totally crash here,

51:25.260 --> 51:26.725
I have a futon in the spare room.

51:26.725 --> 51:29.834
- No thank you, but really, have fun.

51:29.834 --> 51:30.667
- Okay.

51:44.653 --> 51:46.028
- What?

51:46.028 --> 51:47.755
Like together?

51:47.755 --> 51:51.305
- Well, I think I had one too many.

51:51.305 --> 51:53.807
I'm gonna go ahead and head to bed.

51:53.807 --> 51:56.390
- Can I help clean anything up?

51:57.995 --> 52:00.336
- No, just leave everything out,

52:00.336 --> 52:02.174
I'll clean it up in the morning.

52:02.174 --> 52:03.091
- You sure?

52:05.260 --> 52:06.093
- Yeah.

52:26.410 --> 52:27.910
- He's a good guy.

52:29.001 --> 52:31.418
- Oh, yeah, he's a great guy.

52:33.239 --> 52:36.486
- Well, thanks for letting
us party over here.

52:36.486 --> 52:39.417
Hopefully we didn't
mess things up too much.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.084
- Oh, no, it's fine.

52:42.773 --> 52:46.612
- Maybe I should start getting
my friends out of here.

52:46.612 --> 52:50.996
Or at least the ones who're
still awake, anyways.

52:50.996 --> 52:52.996
- Oh, yeah, I-I would rather you guys

52:52.996 --> 52:57.746
just stay here than be out
trying to drive right now, so.

52:59.116 --> 53:00.616
- Well, okay then.

53:02.850 --> 53:05.490
It was really nice talking to you.

53:05.490 --> 53:08.240
I guess I'll just see you around.

53:09.416 --> 53:13.166
- Um, actually, I have
something to show you.

53:14.945 --> 53:16.862
You wanna come with me?

53:25.770 --> 53:27.270
- What's going on?

53:30.031 --> 53:31.198
You all right?

53:57.751 --> 53:59.918
(moaning)

54:06.206 --> 54:08.873
(pensive music)

56:13.661 --> 56:16.411
(rapid knocking)

56:17.331 --> 56:18.780
- Yeah.

56:18.780 --> 56:19.613
- Hey.

56:20.863 --> 56:22.863
Are you taking a shower?

56:23.795 --> 56:26.022
- I was about to, yeah.

56:26.022 --> 56:28.522
- Oh, um, maybe I'll join you.

56:30.840 --> 56:31.673
- Uh, no.

56:33.943 --> 56:36.610
I'm not really feeling up to it.

56:38.103 --> 56:40.860
Kind of under the weather, you know.

56:40.860 --> 56:41.777
- Oh, okay.

56:44.140 --> 56:45.307
- Yeah, sorry.

56:57.100 --> 56:58.767
- It's almost ready.

57:02.700 --> 57:05.143
Um, well you remember that cool Filipino

57:05.143 --> 57:07.143
market we went to?

57:07.143 --> 57:08.643
I got some tocino.

57:11.602 --> 57:12.435
- Um.

57:23.294 --> 57:24.544
It's all right.

57:25.412 --> 57:26.815
- It's just alright?

57:26.815 --> 57:28.420
- Yeah.

57:28.420 --> 57:30.192
- Well, if you don't like it,

57:30.192 --> 57:31.917
I can make you something else.

57:31.917 --> 57:33.140
You know, I also got some-

57:33.140 --> 57:35.855
- No, you know what, can
you just get me some,

57:35.855 --> 57:37.296
like, cereal or something?

57:37.296 --> 57:39.099
- Oh, you don't want that,

57:39.099 --> 57:41.040
they've been in there for weeks now,

57:41.040 --> 57:44.438
it's stale, I really don't
mind making you something!

57:44.438 --> 57:46.105
- It's fine, really.

57:48.974 --> 57:52.307
- O-okay, okay, if that's what you want.

58:12.875 --> 58:14.458
Is everything okay?

58:19.080 --> 58:20.080
- It's fine.

58:22.483 --> 58:24.983
This is exactly what I wanted.

58:32.032 --> 58:34.532
(tense music)

58:43.942 --> 58:44.775
- Dennis.

58:47.314 --> 58:48.147
Dennis.

58:49.531 --> 58:51.733
We're getting a little behind out here,

58:51.733 --> 58:55.483
I was thinking about
asking somebody to stay.

58:58.670 --> 59:00.503
- Um, yeah, I'll stay.

59:02.789 --> 59:03.622
- Really?

59:04.568 --> 59:07.068
- Yeah, it's fine, I'll do it.

59:08.046 --> 59:11.463
I don't have anywhere else to go tonight.

59:28.091 --> 59:29.392
- Okay, yes.

59:29.392 --> 59:31.792
See, it says here that
you have to go to college.

59:31.792 --> 59:34.442
- That's if I want to
be a boss or something,

59:34.442 --> 59:37.597
I'm just looking to be a grunt for now.

59:37.597 --> 59:39.211
- What's going on?

59:39.211 --> 59:40.411
- Oh, hey.

59:40.411 --> 59:42.471
I, Conner and I were just going over

59:42.471 --> 59:44.294
the requirements for the peace corps.

59:44.294 --> 59:45.959
- Hey, Dennis.

59:45.959 --> 59:47.532
- Yeah, I'm sorry, you said you were gonna

59:47.532 --> 59:49.054
be late and I didn't want all this food

59:49.054 --> 59:50.494
to go to waste, so, I...

59:50.494 --> 59:51.406
- You ate without me?

59:51.406 --> 59:55.309
- No, no, there should
be enough left for you.

59:55.309 --> 59:57.354
- Sorry, I-I guess I got
a little carried away,

59:57.354 --> 59:59.092
I've just been working out so much lately

59:59.092 --> 1:00:01.415
that I've been hungry all the time.

1:00:01.415 --> 1:00:03.092
- Oh, oh no, I'm, I'm-,

1:00:03.092 --> 1:00:04.894
I didn't realize it was all gone.

1:00:04.894 --> 1:00:07.146
Oh, with that young metabolism,

1:00:07.146 --> 1:00:09.252
you have to enjoy it while you can.

1:00:09.252 --> 1:00:11.502
(growling)

1:00:12.351 --> 1:00:15.646
- [Narrator] Suddenly a new
lion makes a play for the alpha.

1:00:15.646 --> 1:00:17.531
There will be no negotiations here,

1:00:17.531 --> 1:00:19.883
a fight is inevitable.

1:00:19.883 --> 1:00:21.632
A clash and a brutal display of violence

1:00:21.632 --> 1:00:24.672
and aggression unmatched
anywhere else in nature.

1:00:24.672 --> 1:00:26.571
They both know what is at stake.

1:00:26.571 --> 1:00:28.238
The loser-
- Dennis?

1:00:29.152 --> 1:00:30.611
- Yeah?
- To die a lonely and painful-

1:00:30.611 --> 1:00:32.072
- Why don't you turn
off the TV for a minute

1:00:32.072 --> 1:00:34.294
and come in here?

1:00:34.294 --> 1:00:36.627
- I'm in the middle of this.

1:00:41.515 --> 1:00:45.682
- Well, I think I have
something you'll like more.

1:00:51.564 --> 1:00:55.231
- Oh, oh yeah, yeah
you, you're, you're hot,

1:00:57.162 --> 1:01:00.495
so dirty, oh like it, like it like that?

1:01:03.566 --> 1:01:05.566
(moans)

1:01:07.447 --> 1:01:09.466
Is everything, is everything all right?

1:01:09.466 --> 1:01:11.799
- Yeah, it's fine, I just...

1:01:13.354 --> 1:01:14.187
Fuck.

1:01:19.745 --> 1:01:22.041
I'm just distracted, that's all.

1:01:22.041 --> 1:01:22.874
- Okay.

1:01:24.476 --> 1:01:27.309
Um, well m-maybe, maybe I can, um.

1:01:28.543 --> 1:01:29.599
- No.

1:01:29.599 --> 1:01:30.432
Just.

1:01:34.405 --> 1:01:37.582
You know what, to tell
you the truth, this,

1:01:37.582 --> 1:01:39.832
this isn't doing it for me.

1:01:42.076 --> 1:01:43.326
- Oh, um, okay.

1:01:45.439 --> 1:01:47.939
Uh, well it-it was in the box.

1:01:50.837 --> 1:01:53.754
- Yeah, well it's just not working.

1:01:55.536 --> 1:01:58.531
Maybe you should just change.

1:01:58.531 --> 1:01:59.364
- Okay.

1:02:05.698 --> 1:02:08.698
(moaning)
- Dennis.

1:02:11.669 --> 1:02:12.502
Dennis.

1:02:17.914 --> 1:02:18.747
Dennis.

1:02:23.553 --> 1:02:24.386
Dennis.

1:02:25.303 --> 1:02:26.136
- What?

1:02:27.028 --> 1:02:28.593
- What is going on with you,

1:02:28.593 --> 1:02:30.275
your performance here lately.
- Excuse me for a second,

1:02:30.275 --> 1:02:32.192
I don't feel very well.

1:02:34.799 --> 1:02:36.799
(moans)

1:02:55.896 --> 1:02:57.935
- What the fuck?

1:02:57.935 --> 1:02:59.660
- No, wait, just, for
one second, just wait.

1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:00.493
Wait!

1:03:04.321 --> 1:03:05.154
Fuck!

1:03:11.260 --> 1:03:12.093
Fuck!

1:04:11.121 --> 1:04:14.204
- Oh, hey sweetie, you're home early.

1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:17.960
- Actually, I have something
I have to talk to you about.

1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:18.960
- What's up?

1:04:21.775 --> 1:04:23.059
- What's he doing here?

1:04:23.059 --> 1:04:26.421
- Oh, Conner is fixing the
pipe underneath the sink.

1:04:26.421 --> 1:04:28.797
- It's all good under here,

1:04:28.797 --> 1:04:32.352
you shouldn't have any
more problems with her.

1:04:32.352 --> 1:04:33.269
- With her?

1:04:34.924 --> 1:04:35.841
- The sink.

1:04:38.021 --> 1:04:38.854
Later.

1:04:43.383 --> 1:04:46.966
- So what did you need
to talk to me about?

1:04:51.061 --> 1:04:51.894
- Nothing.

1:04:54.058 --> 1:04:55.701
I just didn't feel very well,

1:04:55.701 --> 1:04:57.402
I had to leave early, that's all.

1:04:57.402 --> 1:05:00.319
- Aw, well you look a little flush.

1:05:01.237 --> 1:05:03.570
You don't feel warm, though.

1:05:05.562 --> 1:05:08.762
- Yeah, it's probably nothing.

1:05:08.762 --> 1:05:11.137
- Okay, um, well, why
don't you have a seat

1:05:11.137 --> 1:05:13.887
and I'll make you some tea, okay?

1:05:14.924 --> 1:05:15.924
Okay?
- Okay.

1:05:35.911 --> 1:05:37.994
So Conner fixed the sink.

1:05:39.363 --> 1:05:41.446
- Yeah, it looks like it.

1:05:43.125 --> 1:05:45.208
- No more back ups, then?

1:05:46.325 --> 1:05:47.158
- Nope.

1:05:49.322 --> 1:05:51.405
- He sounds pretty handy.

1:05:53.024 --> 1:05:54.024
- I suppose.

1:05:56.734 --> 1:05:59.984
- So did you call him or did he just...

1:06:00.868 --> 1:06:05.201
- No, no, I-I just, I ran
into him randomly outside.

1:06:06.358 --> 1:06:09.260
I must have mentioned
it and he-he volunteered

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:11.363
to come over and help.

1:06:11.363 --> 1:06:14.863
- Yeah, you just randomly met him outside.

1:06:18.041 --> 1:06:19.151
- Yeah.

1:06:19.151 --> 1:06:19.984
Randomly.

1:06:22.302 --> 1:06:24.885
- I could have fixed that sink.

1:06:25.981 --> 1:06:29.314
I just, I've just been busy, that's all.

1:06:31.561 --> 1:06:32.728
- I know that.

1:06:33.662 --> 1:06:36.841
- It's just a sink, it's not very hard,

1:06:36.841 --> 1:06:38.099
I could have fixed it.

1:06:38.099 --> 1:06:40.766
(alarm beeping)

1:06:42.539 --> 1:06:44.038
- [Narrator] The trunk fish is a strictly

1:06:44.038 --> 1:06:45.718
monogamous species.

1:06:45.718 --> 1:06:47.342
The females pair with a male,

1:06:47.342 --> 1:06:49.203
lay their eggs and wait patiently

1:06:49.203 --> 1:06:51.342
for their partner to fertilize.

1:06:51.342 --> 1:06:53.641
However sometimes, once the eggs are laid,

1:06:53.641 --> 1:06:55.582
a different male, taking advantage

1:06:55.582 --> 1:06:58.403
of a vulnerable situation,
secretly fertilizes

1:06:58.403 --> 1:07:00.782
the eggs himself, producing a cuckold

1:07:00.782 --> 1:07:02.783
in the process.

1:07:02.783 --> 1:07:04.843
The new male's legacy will live on

1:07:04.843 --> 1:07:06.574
while the monogamous male's lineage,

1:07:06.574 --> 1:07:09.661
sadly and unbeknownst
to him, comes to an end.

1:07:09.661 --> 1:07:13.026
- I don't know what to do anymore.

1:07:13.026 --> 1:07:17.002
It's like since he got
laid off he wants to sit

1:07:17.002 --> 1:07:20.364
around the house all day on his phone.

1:07:20.364 --> 1:07:23.697
- Yeah it's gonna be hard losing his job

1:07:25.184 --> 1:07:26.101
at his age.

1:07:28.042 --> 1:07:31.141
- Okay, I know, I know
we probably seem ancient

1:07:31.141 --> 1:07:34.042
to you, but we're not that old.

1:07:34.042 --> 1:07:36.509
- Well you're not, you're super chill.

1:07:36.509 --> 1:07:37.342
Dennis...

1:07:40.865 --> 1:07:42.782
He just tries too hard.

1:07:43.938 --> 1:07:46.505
- Not everyone can be
perfect like your parents.

1:07:46.505 --> 1:07:47.985
- My parents?

1:07:47.985 --> 1:07:51.902
You think that fucking
pill head Amy is my mom?

1:07:52.964 --> 1:07:54.198
- Pill head?

1:07:54.198 --> 1:07:57.302
- Yeah, it's the dude's third wife.

1:07:57.302 --> 1:07:58.449
- Third?

1:07:58.449 --> 1:08:00.301
Are you serious?

1:08:00.301 --> 1:08:01.422
- Trust me.

1:08:01.422 --> 1:08:04.089
My parents are far from perfect.

1:08:11.561 --> 1:08:12.976
- Hey Conner.

1:08:12.976 --> 1:08:14.396
Start spending any more time
here we're gonna have to start

1:08:14.396 --> 1:08:16.091
charging you rent.

1:08:16.091 --> 1:08:19.181
- Yeah, I was about to head out anyways.

1:08:19.181 --> 1:08:20.014
- Good.

1:08:21.021 --> 1:08:22.291
- Yeah.

1:08:22.291 --> 1:08:23.124
Good.

1:08:24.928 --> 1:08:26.011
Later, Kathy.

1:08:29.754 --> 1:08:30.587
- Kathy.

1:08:43.021 --> 1:08:46.192
You two seem to be getting pretty close.

1:08:46.192 --> 1:08:47.616
- He's a nice kid and he'd just looking

1:08:47.616 --> 1:08:49.449
for a little guidance.

1:08:50.853 --> 1:08:54.055
His parents aren't giving it to him.

1:08:54.055 --> 1:08:58.305
And I think that he sees
us as like contemporaries.

1:09:02.374 --> 1:09:03.207
- Us?

1:09:05.552 --> 1:09:06.385
Or you?

1:09:08.149 --> 1:09:10.914
- He has a ton of respect for you,

1:09:10.914 --> 1:09:13.517
he talks about you all the time.

1:09:13.517 --> 1:09:15.816
- I bet he does, bet he's just touting

1:09:15.816 --> 1:09:18.899
my name as he's nibbling on your ear.

1:09:22.475 --> 1:09:26.438
I don't want you hanging
out with that kid anymore.

1:09:26.438 --> 1:09:29.105
(ominous music)

1:09:31.791 --> 1:09:33.958
(moaning)

1:09:49.930 --> 1:09:52.597
(alarm beeping)

1:09:55.506 --> 1:09:59.589
- Okay if you don't want
Conner over here anymore

1:10:00.607 --> 1:10:01.857
I get it, okay?

1:10:14.905 --> 1:10:15.738
Okay.

1:10:17.309 --> 1:10:18.976
Can we make up, now?

1:10:21.112 --> 1:10:23.029
- Just not in the mood.

1:10:25.144 --> 1:10:25.977
- No?

1:10:27.570 --> 1:10:28.713
Not at all?

1:10:28.713 --> 1:10:29.546
- No.

1:10:32.949 --> 1:10:37.949
- We can pull something out
of the box if you want to.

1:10:38.263 --> 1:10:39.096
- Stop it.

1:10:43.522 --> 1:10:46.355
- What-what's the matter with you?

1:10:47.404 --> 1:10:48.321
- I'm fine.

1:10:51.063 --> 1:10:53.823
- You're not fine, Dennis, you won't,

1:10:53.823 --> 1:10:56.818
you won't touch me, like, you won't,

1:10:56.818 --> 1:10:58.985
you won't even look at me.

1:11:10.204 --> 1:11:13.242
I fucking knew this was
gonna happen, I knew, I,

1:11:13.242 --> 1:11:15.659
I knew this was gonna happen.

1:11:18.202 --> 1:11:19.619
- Look, I'm fine.

1:11:20.682 --> 1:11:21.515
Okay?

1:11:22.756 --> 1:11:23.589
Really.

1:11:24.612 --> 1:11:25.445
I'm fine.

1:11:29.041 --> 1:11:30.779
You know what?

1:11:30.779 --> 1:11:32.779
I got a new idea for us.

1:11:36.081 --> 1:11:37.498
- Wha-what is it?

1:11:38.678 --> 1:11:42.011
- It's something I've been dying to try.

1:11:43.864 --> 1:11:45.521
- Okay, okay well, um, just,

1:11:45.521 --> 1:11:46.918
just put it in the box.

1:11:46.918 --> 1:11:47.751
- No.

1:11:47.751 --> 1:11:50.222
Now. We have to do it
now, we have to do it now.

1:11:50.222 --> 1:11:51.639
Come on, come on.

1:11:55.170 --> 1:11:56.003
- No.

1:11:56.003 --> 1:11:57.600
No, well wait, hold on, no.

1:11:57.600 --> 1:11:59.186
- This is gonna be, this
is gonna be just like

1:11:59.186 --> 1:12:01.186
you've always wanted it.

1:12:03.139 --> 1:12:05.356
- Dennis w-what, j-just,
this, what the f-.

1:12:05.356 --> 1:12:06.189
- Just...

1:12:08.946 --> 1:12:10.196
- Dennis, stop.

1:12:20.872 --> 1:12:22.167
Dennis, stop!

1:12:22.167 --> 1:12:23.992
Stop it, get the fuck off me!

1:12:23.992 --> 1:12:26.392
Get the fuck off me!

1:12:26.392 --> 1:12:27.656
- What?

1:12:27.656 --> 1:12:29.674
I thought that's what you wanted.

1:12:29.674 --> 1:12:31.034
- You're fucking sick.

1:12:31.034 --> 1:12:32.174
- I'm sick?

1:12:32.174 --> 1:12:34.988
I'm not the one who fucked a child.

1:12:34.988 --> 1:12:36.634
What is it about this kid?

1:12:36.634 --> 1:12:39.815
I want to know why he can
make you cum and I can't.

1:12:39.815 --> 1:12:42.684
I mean, what is it about
this kid that makes you

1:12:42.684 --> 1:12:44.463
cum so hard?

1:12:44.463 --> 1:12:46.790
- He treats me like I'm
a fucking human being,

1:12:46.790 --> 1:12:49.769
not just a fucking hole
to shove things into.

1:12:49.769 --> 1:12:51.368
- That's what you wanted.

1:12:51.368 --> 1:12:53.991
- You knew what you were asking me to do.

1:12:53.991 --> 1:12:55.768
- You wanted to do it, you know you wanted

1:12:55.768 --> 1:12:57.367
to do it and you did it.

1:12:57.367 --> 1:12:59.627
And you liked it more
than you liked it with me.

1:12:59.627 --> 1:13:03.024
- If you have any regrets
that is your fault.

1:13:03.024 --> 1:13:05.304
- I can't even look at you anymore.

1:13:05.304 --> 1:13:06.702
- Just get the fuck out, get the fuck,

1:13:06.702 --> 1:13:08.427
just get the fuck out of my house.

1:13:08.427 --> 1:13:10.853
- Fuck you.
- Get the fuck out.

1:13:10.853 --> 1:13:13.520
(pensive music)

1:13:41.587 --> 1:13:42.587
- Hey, Tara.

1:13:43.464 --> 1:13:44.899
- Um, hey Dennis.

1:13:44.899 --> 1:13:46.491
- What a coincidence, huh?

1:13:46.491 --> 1:13:47.928
Where you been?

1:13:47.928 --> 1:13:49.427
- Uh, cheer practice just started

1:13:49.427 --> 1:13:51.927
for the summer so it's
been taking up a lot

1:13:51.927 --> 1:13:52.906
of my time.

1:13:52.906 --> 1:13:53.908
- Yeah, I don't think I've seen you since

1:13:53.908 --> 1:13:55.319
the party at my house.

1:13:55.319 --> 1:13:57.837
- I think you're right, actually, yeah.

1:13:57.837 --> 1:13:59.384
- That was a crazy night, huh?

1:13:59.384 --> 1:14:00.607
- Did it...

1:14:00.607 --> 1:14:01.663
did it get crazy?

1:14:01.663 --> 1:14:03.842
- Yeah, things got pretty wild,

1:14:03.842 --> 1:14:05.604
you should have stuck around.

1:14:05.604 --> 1:14:07.354
- Oh, oh, okay, cool.

1:14:08.642 --> 1:14:10.541
- Yeah, it was, it was
filled with those new

1:14:10.541 --> 1:14:13.216
experiences you like, you
know what I'm talking about?

1:14:13.216 --> 1:14:14.961
- I'm sorry?

1:14:14.961 --> 1:14:16.792
- Remember when we were talking about

1:14:16.792 --> 1:14:18.665
new experiences, remember?

1:14:18.665 --> 1:14:19.950
New experiences.

1:14:19.950 --> 1:14:20.844
New experiences.

1:14:20.844 --> 1:14:22.068
How's this for a new experience?

1:14:22.068 --> 1:14:23.192
- Whoa, what the fuck?

1:14:23.192 --> 1:14:24.357
- Wait, what?

1:14:24.357 --> 1:14:25.809
I thought that you were into this,

1:14:25.809 --> 1:14:28.149
I thought that-
- No, into you?

1:14:28.149 --> 1:14:29.098
Are you crazy?

1:14:29.098 --> 1:14:30.299
- No but I thought, you were...

1:14:30.299 --> 1:14:31.427
You act all sexy, you
acted all interested,

1:14:31.427 --> 1:14:32.588
you acted like you were into me,

1:14:32.588 --> 1:14:34.524
then when it's time to put out
you don't give me anything?

1:14:34.524 --> 1:14:35.988
Oh, but you'll fuck a complete stranger.

1:14:35.988 --> 1:14:38.047
- That is none of your business.

1:14:38.047 --> 1:14:39.169
- Fucking slut.

1:14:39.169 --> 1:14:40.162
- I'm a slut?

1:14:40.162 --> 1:14:41.166
- Yes.
- Really?

1:14:41.166 --> 1:14:42.505
Get the fuck out of here.

1:14:42.505 --> 1:14:44.003
You're an old man coming
up to the high school

1:14:44.003 --> 1:14:46.363
trying to find little
girls to prey on, really?

1:14:46.363 --> 1:14:47.563
- What the fuck?

1:14:47.563 --> 1:14:49.812
- I wonder how you wife
would feel about that.

1:14:49.812 --> 1:14:52.729
Let's see how your wife likes that.

1:14:58.213 --> 1:15:00.380
(sobbing)

1:15:09.115 --> 1:15:11.782
(ominous music)

1:15:38.794 --> 1:15:39.627
- Hey.

1:15:44.282 --> 1:15:46.282
- You shouldn't be here.

1:15:47.279 --> 1:15:49.738
- You don't get to pretend
like you didn't do anything.

1:15:49.738 --> 1:15:52.042
Like nothing's wrong.

1:15:52.042 --> 1:15:53.625
- Nothing is wrong.

1:15:54.503 --> 1:15:56.608
You knew what this was about
and if you've got a problem,

1:15:56.608 --> 1:15:58.397
that's your fucking problem.

1:15:58.397 --> 1:16:00.147
- You ruined my life.

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:05.433
Fight me.

1:16:10.362 --> 1:16:11.676
- What?

1:16:11.676 --> 1:16:13.593
- You have to fight me.

1:16:15.125 --> 1:16:16.397
- Why?

1:16:16.397 --> 1:16:19.159
- Because that's the way that it works,

1:16:19.159 --> 1:16:20.396
those are the rules.

1:16:20.396 --> 1:16:21.229
- Look.

1:16:21.229 --> 1:16:24.018
My parents are on the way home right now

1:16:24.018 --> 1:16:25.967
and they're definitely
gonna fuck up all our shit

1:16:25.967 --> 1:16:27.832
if they heard what happened.

1:16:27.832 --> 1:16:29.749
- You have to fight me.

1:16:30.918 --> 1:16:33.359
- How about instead, I
call the cops and tell them

1:16:33.359 --> 1:16:35.923
that your wife fucked a 16 year old

1:16:35.923 --> 1:16:37.756
while you recorded it.

1:16:50.222 --> 1:16:53.805
Or we can forget any
of this ever happened.

1:17:03.038 --> 1:17:05.121
(groans)

1:17:06.334 --> 1:17:10.667
- Motherfucker, you can't
just do whatever you want.

1:17:28.399 --> 1:17:31.316
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1:17:32.914 --> 1:17:36.414
It wasn't supposed to be like any of this.

1:17:56.469 --> 1:17:58.886
(soft music)

1:19:54.358 --> 1:19:57.611
This is exactly what I wanted.

1:19:57.611 --> 1:20:00.278
(pensive music)
