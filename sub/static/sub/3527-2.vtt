You think you know a story,
but you only know how it ends.

00:06.600 --> 00:11.000
To get to the heart of the story,
you have to go back to the beginning.

<i>~ Season 1 - Episode 2 ~
"Simply Henry"</i>

01:39.400 --> 01:42.700
- Halt.
- Halt!

01:43.500 --> 01:45.300
There it is.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.900
Val D'Or.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.100
The Valley of Gold.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.800
- What if the French don't show?
- Oh, they'll show.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.200
They'll just be fashionably late.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.400
Your Majesty, look. There they are.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.900
What's the plan?

02:05.200 --> 02:07.600
I was to ride down alone
and meet the king.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.800
It's a trap. What if they mean
to lure you down to kill you?

02:13.100 --> 02:16.400
All of you. On pain of death.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.500
Stay.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.300
Come on.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.000
The king.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.300
What is thou doing?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.500
- Cousin.
- Cousin.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.400
After you.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.600
After you.

03:22.500 --> 03:26.000
- How do you like my beard?
- You almost look French, you know?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
Hear ye. Hear ye.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.900
"I, Henry, by the grace of God
King of England...

03:47.200 --> 03:48.800
...lreland and France, do hereby..."

03:49.000 --> 03:50.500
Stop.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.800
I cannot be that while you are here,
for I would be a liar.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.600
During this summit,
I am simply Henry, King of England.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.100
And I am just Francois.

04:17.399 --> 04:21.100
King of France and Burgundy.

04:31.900 --> 04:35.200
Majesties, may I ask you each
to place a hand upon the Holy Bible...

04:35.600 --> 04:40.100
...and swear before God and these
princes and lords here gathered...

04:40.600 --> 04:45.700
...that you will be true, virtuous,
and loving to each other.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.300
I so swear.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.600
I swear too. Of course.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.600
Princess Mary.

05:29.900 --> 05:34.100
May I introduce Prince Henry Philip,
your future husband?

05:48.200 --> 05:50.000
Are you the Dauphin of France?

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
Then I want to kiss you.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.900
Mary.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.600
I have got to get one of these.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.300
Palace of Illusions.
What do you think?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.700
It's incredible, Your Majesty.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.800
It's only painted canvas.

06:32.700 --> 06:36.900
- But real wine.
- Don't drink too much of it, Charles.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.100
Your Majesty.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.000
And now I have a gift for you.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.600
- You embarrass me, brother.
- Oh, no.

07:42.900 --> 07:46.900
And all I can give you in return
is this pastry.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.100
What are you thinking, Charles?

08:52.400 --> 08:55.900
I'm thinking that, while I'm here I
should behave like the King of France.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.500
Which means?

08:57.800 --> 09:01.000
Which means I shall slip readily
into the gardens of others...

09:01.300 --> 09:04.300
...and drink water
from many fountains, eh?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.500
Do you see
that young woman over there?

09:12.900 --> 09:15.200
Dressed in purple and gold?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.200
Yes.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.100
Her name is Mary Boleyn,
the daughter of the ambassador...

09:22.900 --> 09:24.400
...with her sister Anne.

09:24.700 --> 09:30.600
I call Mary my English mare
because I ride her so often.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.900
Gentlemen.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.400
Thomas.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.500
Papa.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.300
King Henry noticed you today.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.700
He wants to see you.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.400
Wait.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.300
I must go and tell Anne.

10:39.700 --> 10:40.900
Anne.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.500
What's your name, boy?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.700
Thomas Tallis, Your Majesty.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.400
Tallis. Good voice.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.900
- Take a sovereign for your song.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.900
- Boleyn.
- What of Buckingham?

11:55.400 --> 11:57.700
In my presence,
he has railed against your eminence.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.200
Calling you a necromancer, a pimp.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.800
Accusing you of using evil ways
to maintain your hold over the king.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.200
And what did Lord Buckingham say
about the king?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.500
He told me
he has a greater claim to the throne.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.900
And that as His Majesty
has no male heirs, and will have none...

12:14.300 --> 12:18.200
...that he, Buckingham,
will succeed to the throne.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.500
But he also told me
that he has considered...

12:21.800 --> 12:24.100
...bringing that eventuality
forward more quickly.

12:25.300 --> 12:29.800
- In what way?
- By assassinating His Majesty.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.400
You did well to come to me.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.900
But I must warn you,
say nothing of this to anyone.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.500
You see that, brother?
In most things, we French excel you.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.600
We have the greatest painters...

13:12.900 --> 13:15.600
...the greatest musicians
and the greatest poets.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Most of whom, by the way,
live at my court de ma cie.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.800
The greatest philosophical minds,
engineers, architects.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.400
And of course,
we have the most beautiful women.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.700
You won't deny that, will you?

13:34.500 --> 13:37.500
Even our wrestlers
are better than yours.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.500
- Are you sure?
- What?

13:43.800 --> 13:47.300
I said are you sure
all your wrestlers are better than mine?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.700
Do you wanna prove it?

13:57.100 --> 13:58.400
What are you suggesting?

13:58.600 --> 14:02.900
I am challenging you
to a wrestling match, brother.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.500
No.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.100
You're a coward.

14:08.100 --> 14:11.300
The French honour is at stake.
I accept your challenge.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.300
- Let's do it now.
- Groom.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.900
- Your Majesty...
- No.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.400
Majesties, gentlemen.

14:54.700 --> 14:55.800
The rules are as follows:

14:56.100 --> 14:59.900
First man to throw his opponent to the
ground shall be declared the winner.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.700
- Are you content?
- Yes.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.400
Then fight on.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.000
- What bet will you lay?
- Come on, Henry.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.700
- Two kings, two queens and a fool.
- Who's the fool?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.400
I don't know yet, but it's a full house.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.100
Come on, Your Majesty.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.500
Henry's gonna win.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.500
Whatever happens,
he's not gonna win.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.900
- Come on, Henry.
- Come on, Henry, you got him.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
Come on. Come on.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.100
- Come on, monsieur.
- Yes.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.300
I want a rematch. I want a rematch.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.900
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a rematch?

16:29.300 --> 16:32.100
Are you calling me afraid?
Of what am I supposed to be afraid?

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
- Of me!
- Let's have it then.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.700
I'm not gonna sign this treaty.
I'm not gonna sign it, go and tell them.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.000
- Lf that's what you...
- Go and tell them.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.400
All right.
If you want the world to know...

16:45.700 --> 16:49.400
...that the king is changeable, shallow,
intemperate...

16:49.700 --> 16:53.100
...incapable of keeping his word,
then, of course, I will go and tell them.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.100
After all, I am merely
Your Majesty's humble servant.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.900
- Lady Mary.
- Your Majesty.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.700
I have heard a lot about you.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.600
You've been at the French court
for two years.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.500
Tell me.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.800
What French graces
have you learned?

18:47.800 --> 18:52.100
- With Your Majesty's permission?
- Granted.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.500
And now I ask his gracious Majesty,
the King of England...

20:04.800 --> 20:10.500
...to also sign in good faith, the Treaty
of Universal and Perpetual Peace.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.600
Leave.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.500
Forget about the French,
the Queen's nephew has been elected.

22:41.900 --> 22:44.100
Now he is not only Charles V,
the King of Spain,

22:44.400 --> 22:46.500
...he's also the Holy Roman Emperor.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.600
His dominions are vast,
his wealth extraordinary.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
And he's only 20 years old.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.000
You will make arrangements
to visit him at Aachen. Personally.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.100
It may suit us better to do business
with him than with the French.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.700
Yes, Majesty.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.900
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Your Grace.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.700
Your Grace...

23:24.900 --> 23:27.200
What did you think
of that performance?

23:27.800 --> 23:29.600
- L...
- Don't be stupid, you're not.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.300
The king's performance at the summit.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.300
How did it strike you?

23:34.500 --> 23:37.100
Personally, I would have wished
to have seen a greater...

23:37.500 --> 23:40.500
...more powerful man
upon the throne of England.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.100
Someone whose presence...

23:42.400 --> 23:44.900
...would have made the French
sit up and come to heel.

23:45.500 --> 23:50.200
I have the way and the means
to crush the usurper of my throne...

23:50.600 --> 23:52.700
...as one would crush
a revolting spider.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.200
I will make him wish
he'd entered the Church after all...

23:56.500 --> 23:59.900
...and left the affairs of the state
to those who are born to rule.

24:05.900 --> 24:10.900
You betray me, Boleyn,
I'll feed your body to me dogs.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.500
Now,
what have you discovered here?

24:22.900 --> 24:25.600
I have it on good authority...

24:27.100 --> 24:30.400
...that the Duke of Buckingham
is raising an army.

24:31.300 --> 24:34.300
He says it's to protect him
while he tours his Welsh estates...

24:34.600 --> 24:36.100
...where he's not popular.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.200
He's also been borrowing
large sums of money.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.200
Buckingham?

24:53.600 --> 24:58.700
Invite him to court for the New Year.
But don't say anything to alarm him.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.500
How are your children?

25:17.800 --> 25:20.200
They're well, thank you,
Your Majesty.

25:21.300 --> 25:25.500
I encourage them all at their studies.
Even the girls.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.400
Always the idealist.

25:28.200 --> 25:32.700
At some point, I imagine,
it will be considered ordinary enough...

25:33.100 --> 25:36.100
...and nothing strange
for a girl to be educated.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.600
I've received a gift
from the Duke of Urbino.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.100
It's a book called The Prince,
by a Florentine, Niccolo Machiavelli.

25:44.500 --> 25:48.300
Yes, I know it.
It's about political opportunism.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.400
It's true.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.000
It's not like your book Utopia.

25:55.500 --> 25:59.500
It's less utopian.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.600
Nevertheless,
he asks an important question:

26:05.900 --> 26:10.300
Whether it is better for a king
to be feared or loved.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.000
Buckingham is going to try and kill me.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.300
- Your Eminence.
- Lady Blount.

26:44.700 --> 26:48.100
- You are full term?
- In a little while.

26:50.300 --> 26:54.200
- Are you well?
- As can be expected.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.700
Have you some message
from His Majesty?

26:57.600 --> 27:01.200
No, none. But from your husband.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.100
My husband.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.100
Yes, I have spoken to him.

27:07.500 --> 27:12.300
He finds that he has reconciled
to your condition.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.500
Then he won't send me to a nunnery?

27:15.900 --> 27:19.300
He will be made an earl,
and given estates.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.000
And my child?

27:25.700 --> 27:29.400
That is for the king to decide
whether he will recognise the child.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.300
I'm afraid I can offer you
no more comfort than that.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.400
Will you tell the king
of my love for him?

28:04.900 --> 28:08.600
My lord, I hereby pledge my allegiance
to you and your house.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.800
And do swear to serve you,
even unto death.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.800
We thank you
from the bottom of our heart.

28:15.100 --> 28:21.600
And in due course, you will find your
loyalties richly and properly rewarded.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.400
I thought I should tell you.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.200
I'm being sent to meet
the new Holy Roman Emperor.

28:37.700 --> 28:40.700
The king has asked me to draw up
a new treaty...

28:41.300 --> 28:43.000
...uniting us against the French.

28:44.900 --> 28:49.800
- You must be very disappointed.
- I am very realistic.

28:51.900 --> 28:53.400
Then I am disappointed.

28:53.700 --> 28:58.300
- Our dreams were very unrealistic.
- Maybe so.

28:58.800 --> 29:04.000
But I will continue to dream them,
even if I am alone in doing so.

29:13.400 --> 29:19.200
I fear His Majesty no longer
trusts or cares for me as he once did.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.700
Thomas,
let me give you a little advice.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.600
If you want to keep the love of a prince,
this is what you must do.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.200
You must be prepared to give him the
thing you most care for in all the world.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.500
The thing I care for most
is my integrity.

29:41.900 --> 29:44.900
What is it you care for most
in the world, Your Eminence?

30:06.100 --> 30:08.200
His Grace, the Duke of Norfolk.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.500
Your Grace.

30:14.600 --> 30:18.400
I hope Your Majesty will accept
this humble gift for the New Year.

30:23.900 --> 30:27.500
We are very grateful to Your Grace.
Your generosity overwhelms me.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.700
As always.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.900
Lie down.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.300
- Get some linens.
- His Grace, the Duke of Buckingham.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.600
Your Grace.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.500
Your Majesty.

31:13.300 --> 31:19.000
- It has some words engraved on it.
- Give it to me.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.300
"With humble, true hearts."

31:28.000 --> 31:32.700
Your Grace overwhelms me.
Your words touch me.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.400
They are the greatest gift.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.500
Greater than any riches.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.200
Push, my Lady. Push.

32:01.700 --> 32:05.100
Breathe. It's coming.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.100
With true and humble heart.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.000
There.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.100
Hold, Your Grace.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.600
What do you want?

32:59.900 --> 33:02.500
Your Grace is arrested
on suspicion of treason.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.900
I'm ordered by the king's majesty
to take you to the Tower.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.300
You take my advice, gentlemen,
you let us pass.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.100
By no means.
And if any of your men should strike...

33:12.400 --> 33:15.600
...against His Majesty's servants
in pursuit of their duties...

33:16.000 --> 33:18.800
...that's treason too.
As Your Grace should know.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.800
Your Grace.

33:27.900 --> 33:32.500
You. You are only new men.
You don't know anything.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.900
If I am accused of treason...

33:35.300 --> 33:39.200
...I should be judged by a jury of my
peers, not by the dogs of butchers.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.000
There's no lord in England
who will ever find against me.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.700
Form them up.

33:58.200 --> 34:02.900
I have instituted a Court of High
Steward to judge Buckingham's case.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.500
Twenty peers will be appointed
to the court.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.400
Norfolk will be first among them.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.600
- Your Majesty, if I may?
- What?

34:12.500 --> 34:16.100
I believe it could be dangerous
to find the duke guilty of treason.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.699
- Even if he is?
- Even if he is.

34:21.199 --> 34:25.100
On the other hand, he could be
found guilty of some lesser offence.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.699
Heavily fined and banished from court.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.400
In that way, he would be disgraced,
but his friends and allies...

34:32.699 --> 34:36.300
...would have little cause or occasion
to rise against you.

34:36.699 --> 34:41.699
- And that would be the best outcome?
- I believe it would, yes.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.199
And you would see to it
that the court come to that decision?

34:47.600 --> 34:49.600
I have every confidence.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.900
As I have in Your Eminence.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.400
Wolsey will set up the court.
Norfolk will head it.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.700
I want you to remind His Grace
of his responsibilities.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.900
14-30.
Chase to four, gentlemen.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.700
Ball.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.300
Mary?

35:18.600 --> 35:22.000
Does the king
still call for you at night?

35:25.800 --> 35:27.100
No, Papa.

35:34.900 --> 35:38.100
Even though the king is your godfather,
when you approach him...

35:40.100 --> 35:41.600
Your Grace.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.300
What do you want?

35:43.500 --> 35:45.100
Only to pass on His Majesty's love.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.900
He appreciates the role you will play
at my Lord Buckingham's trial...

35:49.200 --> 35:52.500
...and for all the care you have
for His Majesty's well-being.

35:53.700 --> 35:54.800
He also sends you this.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.100
This is my father's ring.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.800
He was executed by His Majesty's
father, did you know that?

36:17.800 --> 36:20.000
His Majesty thought
you might like to wear it.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.900
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.

36:27.200 --> 36:31.200
And he's going to be received
by his godfather, the king.

36:34.100 --> 36:36.400
Your Grace should have a care
for his inheritance.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.700
It would be terrible
if some action of yours...

36:42.900 --> 36:47.800
...were to deprive him of a father,
a title and a ring.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.700
Your Grace.

37:19.100 --> 37:22.600
Your Grace
has been accused of treason...

37:23.000 --> 37:26.800
...and of imagining and plotting
the death of the king's majesty.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.300
This court of High Steward...

37:29.600 --> 37:32.500
...after reviewing all the evidence
against Your Grace...

37:35.800 --> 37:40.000
...finds Your Grace
guilty of the charges against you.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
No.

37:44.200 --> 37:49.700
And so sentences Your Grace to death
at His Majesty's pleasure.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.600
This is your doing.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.000
Butcher's dog.

37:55.300 --> 37:58.200
It's all your doing!

38:04.400 --> 38:06.200
Bastards!

38:53.100 --> 38:54.800
Your Majesty.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.700
God bless you, sir.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.300
Take this, Your Grace.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.400
Traitor.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.900
Do you forgive me?

40:29.700 --> 40:31.800
Your Grace must lie down.

40:52.300 --> 40:55.100
When you stretch out your arms,
I will strike.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.900
Stretch out your arms.

41:30.600 --> 41:35.500
I have a son. I have a son.

41:38.100 --> 41:39.700
Thank God.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.400
Thank God.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
Come on, you charlatan.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.400
I have a son!

42:20.000 --> 42:21.800
I have a son, God.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.600
Can you hear me? I have a son.

43:08.300 --> 43:11.700
Your Majesty is to be congratulated
on such a happy event.

43:12.100 --> 43:14.200
Thank you, Your Eminence.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.500
The Lady is upstairs.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.800
- Henry, congratulations.
- Thank you, Charles.

43:26.200 --> 43:30.700
- I always knew it wasn't my fault.
- No.

43:38.400 --> 43:42.600
His Majesty
has decided to recognise his son.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.100
He will be known for the present
as Henry Fitzroy.

43:46.400 --> 43:49.800
And he will have his own establishment
at Durham House...

43:50.200 --> 43:55.400
...with a chaplain, officer
and a retinue befitting his station.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.800
Thank you.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.800
You should write
and thank His Majesty.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.500
I only do his bidding.

44:10.600 --> 44:14.300
The queen. The queen.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.100
To my son.

45:21.900 --> 45:24.200
What was your deal with Wolsey?

45:25.500 --> 45:28.900
In return for England
not going to war with France...

45:29.200 --> 45:32.100
...I promised him the French vote.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.900
The fact is, Wolsey has gone to Aachen
to meet the new emperor.

45:36.300 --> 45:39.700
He obviously means to break the treaty
with your king.

45:40.200 --> 45:41.900
In which case...

45:42.100 --> 45:46.000
...we are no longer obliged
to deliver our side of the bargain.

46:00.300 --> 46:02.300
In any case,
we don't want an English Pope.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.700
We had one once.

46:03.900 --> 46:06.900
He was insane. Never again.

46:07.300 --> 46:10.800
The Pope must be an Italian.
That is God's will.

46:11.600 --> 46:15.200
- Your Holiness must swallow it.
- Push it.

47:19.300 --> 47:24.700
My Lady, full of grace, I pray you,
I beseech you in all humility...

47:25.200 --> 47:29.500
...for the love I bear for you,
and for your son, Jesus Christ.

47:29.900 --> 47:34.100
I pray you give me a child.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.900
A son to fill my empty womb.

47:39.100 --> 47:41.300
I beg you.

47:50.700 --> 47:55.800
In a few weeks, the court
will quit Whitehall for Hampton Court.

47:57.900 --> 48:01.400
There's been an incident
of Sweating Sickness in the city.

48:01.900 --> 48:05.400
You know how afraid the king is
of any illness.

48:06.400 --> 48:07.700
How is the king?

48:17.000 --> 48:21.200
I was sorry to hear
of Cardinal Orsini's election as Pope.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.700
You are perpetually sorry, More.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.900
- I wasn't simply being polite.
- Oh, really?

48:29.200 --> 48:30.800
I was not.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.800
As long as there is such corruption
in the Church...

48:34.100 --> 48:36.700
...that heretic Luther
will continue to gain followers.

48:39.100 --> 48:42.300
I know that if you had been elected
he would have worked tirelessly...

48:42.600 --> 48:45.100
...to cleanse the Church
of all its evil practises.

48:49.400 --> 48:52.600
Perhaps you think too highly of me,
Thomas.

48:54.700 --> 48:58.300
Perhaps, you think too highly
of the whole human race.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.400
- Lady Blount.
- Mr. More.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.200
The queen.

49:25.900 --> 49:27.500
My lady.

49:30.500 --> 49:32.500
The queen.

50:10.300 --> 50:13.200
- Uncle.
- Anne.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.700
- Sweet Anne.
- Yes, Papa.

50:35.100 --> 50:38.000
- You know why you're here?
- No, Papa.

50:38.300 --> 50:42.000
- In Paris no one explained.
- Good, it's better that way.

50:43.300 --> 50:44.300
What's happened?

50:44.500 --> 50:47.100
His Majesty is tiring
of his French alliance.

50:48.500 --> 50:53.300
It seems he's also tiring of your sister.
He no longer invites her to his bed.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.500
- Poor Mary.
- Poor us.

50:56.800 --> 51:00.000
When she was his mistress,
all our fortunes were made.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.100
Now most likely they will fall.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.200
Unless...

51:12.100 --> 51:15.900
Even if he had me,
who is to say he would keep me?

51:16.200 --> 51:19.800
It's not just Mary. They say
that all his liaisons are soon over.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.900
He blows hot, he blows cold.

51:23.500 --> 51:27.600
Perhaps you could imagine a way
to keep his interest more...

51:29.200 --> 51:30.800
...prolonged?

51:31.800 --> 51:34.700
I daresay
you learned things in France.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.400
How to play his passions?

51:39.400 --> 51:43.100
There's something
deep and dangerous in you, Anne.

51:43.800 --> 51:47.900
Those eyes of yours
are like dark hooks for the soul.

51:59.500 --> 52:01.200
How was your meeting
with the emperor?

52:01.500 --> 52:03.300
Good. Productive.

52:04.400 --> 52:08.400
He makes no secret
of his antipathy for the French.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.000
He wants to go to war with them...

52:11.300 --> 52:14.600
...and he's desperate
for an alliance with Your Majesty.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.900
And in return for our alliance?

52:18.200 --> 52:24.100
There will be a joint invasion of France
for the overthrow of King Francis.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.400
And I shall claim the crown.

52:27.700 --> 52:32.400
And once more truly be King
of England, Ireland and France.

52:32.800 --> 52:35.100
Just like my forefathers.

52:39.300 --> 52:42.300
Your Eminence has built
the most beautiful palace here.

52:42.700 --> 52:46.600
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Probably the finest house in England.

52:48.500 --> 52:53.600
I have nothing to compare with it.
Nothing to show more fair.

53:01.300 --> 53:03.200
Your Majesty...

53:05.500 --> 53:07.400
...it is yours.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.200
With the furnishings?

53:28.300 --> 53:29.500
Come on.
