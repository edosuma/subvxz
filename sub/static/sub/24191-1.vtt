01:32.359 --> 01:33.759
Uh, OK.

02:04.257 --> 02:08.160
Journalist friends
 of mine say of all the people
  that do journalism,

02:08.195 --> 02:09.761
       war photographers
       are the craziest.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.364
    Can you talk about that?

02:12.399 --> 02:14.666
Well, the problem
  with war photography

02:14.701 --> 02:18.670
        is that there's
       absolutely no way
   to do it from a distance.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.539
     You have to be close.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.707
You can't do it from your hotel,

02:22.742 --> 02:25.677
        you can't do it
    from across the street,
       across the bridge.

02:25.712 --> 02:26.645
     You have to be there.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.517
  There's really no substitute
           for that.

02:33.220 --> 02:38.657
So, you have to figure out ways
 to get in the midst of things,

02:38.692 --> 02:39.658
  no matter what's happening.

02:39.693 --> 02:44.596
    And you have to suspend
     your reason sometimes

02:44.631 --> 02:46.765
     to do that and I think
  that's where that reputation
          comes from.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.375
Name a country
  torn apart by war
 in the last six years or so

02:57.410 --> 02:59.611
        and chances are
 Chris Hondros has been there.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.379
He has worked in most of
the world's major conflict zones

03:01.414 --> 03:02.047
     since the late 1990s.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.415
     Iraq, Liberia, Kosovo.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.383
Through the lens of his camera,
 Chris Hondros has taken...

03:05.418 --> 03:07.852
Pulitzer Prize nominated
  war photographer

03:07.887 --> 03:09.288
         Chris Hondros
      for Getty Images...

03:10.590 --> 03:11.856
Chris is a staff photographer

03:11.891 --> 03:14.492
     for the international
   photo agency Getty Images.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.596
    He's just returned from
    his ninth stint in Iraq.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.710
I'm not one of these people
 that got into war photography

03:31.745 --> 03:32.978
         for the rush.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.481
 I'm not into adventure sports
 or anything like that either.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.851
            I mean,
   I believe in photography,
     I believe in the role

03:39.886 --> 03:42.554
        that journalists
       and photographers
       specifically play

03:42.589 --> 03:44.589
      in our whole system
   of international conflict

03:44.624 --> 03:46.725
and how we resolve differences.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.662
     We have a role to play
and I would like to be involved
            in that.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.374
 Well, I'm gonna guess this is
   maybe the earliest picture

04:02.409 --> 04:05.277
I've got of Chris and this is me
       taking this photo

04:05.312 --> 04:09.414
           just like,
   "Here I am in high school"
      and, lo and behold,

04:09.449 --> 04:11.483
there's the guy who would end up
     being my best friend.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.854
      Pretty young, Chris.

04:16.623 --> 04:17.356
             Um...

04:24.831 --> 04:26.631
 This is a tiny little portion

04:26.666 --> 04:29.835
 of all of the experiences that
  he had throughout his life.

04:31.871 --> 04:35.607
  Experiences that practically
      no one in the world

04:35.642 --> 04:36.408
         has ever had.

04:37.644 --> 04:44.649
      He had a front seat
   to every major world event

04:44.684 --> 04:46.518
      of the last decade.

04:48.855 --> 04:53.525
     He was my best friend
  but that doesn't even begin

04:53.560 --> 04:56.428
     to scratch the surface
    of how I felt about him.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.764
    And there's an instinct
       that I've got that

04:59.799 --> 05:01.933
     parts of him are still
      out there somewhere.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.770
       That parts of him
   can be found in the people

05:05.805 --> 05:08.340
         and the places
  that were important to him.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.899
Some of the most powerful,
  in my opinion anyway,

05:34.934 --> 05:36.133
            some of
   the most powerful pictures

05:36.169 --> 05:39.504
       that you've taken
        were in Liberia
    and it just seems to me

05:39.539 --> 05:42.340
    in looking at them that
  you had a deeper connection

05:42.375 --> 05:44.709
  to what was going on there.
          Am I right?

05:44.744 --> 05:50.014
I was quite fond, yeah,
 of Liberians and Liberia.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.817
        I was passionate
     about that war I think

05:52.852 --> 05:55.553
      because it was a war
         that could be
    really easily prevented.

05:55.588 --> 05:56.721
You know, there were things that
  the international community

05:56.756 --> 05:58.890
  could have done that summer
   that would have prevented

05:58.925 --> 06:01.659
  the caustic situation there.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.731
Chris had a very firm belief

06:06.766 --> 06:09.401
       in what he wanted
  his photography to be about.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.741
        I could drop him
       into any situation

06:16.776 --> 06:19.444
  and I didn't have to explain
       why he was there.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.120
    He believed in the power
       of shining a light

06:29.155 --> 06:30.922
    in places that otherwise
         would be dark.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.805
            In 2003,
  I was covering what ended up

06:46.840 --> 06:50.442
        being the climax
   of the Liberian civil war
        in West Africa.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.446
    The rebels were starting
  to move in towards Monrovia,

06:54.481 --> 06:57.048
  towards the capital, trying
     to push Charles Taylor

06:57.083 --> 06:59.884
  out of power, and you know,
  we were hearing about a lot

06:59.919 --> 07:03.121
    of attacks on civilians,
     atrocities, massacres.

07:04.824 --> 07:07.158
  And we were going and trying
     to verify this stuff.

07:15.969 --> 07:19.137
       I met Chris, I was
        helping him out
    going to the frontlines

07:19.172 --> 07:22.073
         to cover a war
      that we were dying,

07:22.108 --> 07:23.074
  we were killing each other.

07:24.043 --> 07:27.045
    Chris left United States
     that is more peaceful

07:27.080 --> 07:29.614
and came here to tell our story

07:29.649 --> 07:32.684
        and I can recall
    the risks that he took.

07:35.488 --> 07:37.556
Photographers always want to go
   where there is shooting.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.694
           They say,
"Why is that shooting going on?"
They say, "I want to get there."

07:46.699 --> 07:48.500
The armies on both sides
   at this point

07:48.535 --> 07:51.870
      had just broken down
       into pure militia.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.773
  They were mostly shirtless,
    a lot of child soldiers.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.509
   Bullets flying everywhere.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.710
We'd see children

07:58.745 --> 08:02.814
   as young as seven, eight,
         nine years old
          with AK-47s.

08:02.849 --> 08:06.150
   These kids were starving,
   hungry, hopped up on drugs

08:06.185 --> 08:08.786
     that they'd been given
       by the commanders.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.856
      There was an element
     of real madness to it.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.562
   There was one particularly
  bad day when I had been out,

08:17.597 --> 08:19.097
        I'd been caught
    in this mortar barrage,

08:20.266 --> 08:21.799
    and I remember running,
       trying to get back

08:21.834 --> 08:24.135
    to the hotel because it
  had a thick concrete ceiling

08:24.170 --> 08:27.772
   and I thought I could hide
        in the basement
   or something and be safe.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.141
      A few minutes later,
  the school across the street

08:30.176 --> 08:32.744
            was hit
  with a huge artillery shell.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.847
 There were all these civilians
   packed into the courtyard,

08:36.883 --> 08:39.217
they'd been taking refuge there
     and the shell dropped

08:39.251 --> 08:40.552
  right in the middle of them.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.956
  And Chris ran into the hotel
       and he grabbed me

08:44.991 --> 08:46.591
          and he said,
     "The school's been hit
       across the street,

08:46.626 --> 08:48.960
      we've gotta go over
        and photograph."

08:48.995 --> 08:53.531
   And I was so shell shocked
          I was like,
 "No more, I'm done, I can't."

08:53.566 --> 08:57.068
        I just, sort of,
     cowered in the hotel,
    I couldn't go back out.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.570
   He went back out into it.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.207
He photographed the whole thing
    and he helped get people
        to the hospital.

09:11.618 --> 09:15.186
You learn how
  to face your fears,
 I guess, in these situations.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.055
   I mean if you don't do it,
  you've wasted all your time,
             right?

09:17.090 --> 09:19.657
      I mean, you've spent
  all this time and difficulty

09:19.692 --> 09:22.594
  getting to these situations
         to do the work

09:22.629 --> 09:24.195
         that you feel
     that needs to be done

09:24.230 --> 09:28.766
    and if you don't go that
 final mile to actually perform

09:28.801 --> 09:31.736
under the stressful situations,
       then you've wasted
         all your time.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.645
    The frontline of the war
     for most of the summer

09:40.680 --> 09:43.781
    was this pair of bridges
        and rebel troops

09:43.816 --> 09:45.951
        were on one side
   and the government troops
       were on the other.

09:50.123 --> 09:55.093
 And the first couple days that
 that area was the front-line,
     I ventured down there.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.163
            We were
  with the government soldiers

09:58.198 --> 10:00.264
          just before
   they were about to charge
    the bridge and I thought

10:00.299 --> 10:02.634
 it would be way too dangerous
          to do those.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.937
      It was just exposed,
        nowhere to hide,
        nowhere to duck,

10:05.972 --> 10:08.006
bullets were flying everywhere.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.975
  But something clicked in me
         at the moment

10:11.010 --> 10:13.311
  when I was thinking about it
        and just as they
     were about to charge.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.814
  You know, I kind of realized
         at that moment
      that my whole career

10:16.849 --> 10:18.149
      as a photographer in
   a way had been leading up

10:18.184 --> 10:18.850
     to a moment like that.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.820
      And that the picture
       was on the bridge,

10:22.855 --> 10:25.256
     it wasn't 50 feet away
 from the middle of the bridge,

10:25.291 --> 10:26.991
     it was on the bridge.

10:27.026 --> 10:27.825
 There was no shortcut to that.

10:54.854 --> 10:57.321
This is the iconic photo.

10:57.356 --> 11:01.025
You know, and Chris at his best
        which was often,

11:01.060 --> 11:04.729
       he had the ability
 to kind of find those photos.

11:04.764 --> 11:08.399
  I think when I first saw it,
    it was immediate concern
        for his safety.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.435
     I was just like, man,
      he's getting close.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.139
The thing you have to understand
    in a situation like that

11:15.174 --> 11:16.841
         there's still
    probably bullets flying.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.744
         You're worried
      about being exposed.

11:19.779 --> 11:24.148
     And being able to keep
       a presence of mind

11:24.183 --> 11:26.084
to really focus on the subject,

11:26.119 --> 11:28.720
     to frame the subject,
        to get that kind
       of pinnacle moment

11:28.755 --> 11:31.823
is really pretty damn difficult.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.758
      When you'd hear him
      tell the story about

11:33.793 --> 11:36.427
 how dangerous that bridge was
       and how much metal

11:36.462 --> 11:40.298
was flying around and you think,
to make this graceful photograph

11:40.333 --> 11:44.202
 amid all that is just amazing.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.938
       And it's one thing
       that it happened,

11:46.973 --> 11:50.108
    it's another thing that
     there's another person
        documenting it.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.409
One of
 the most compelling photos

11:51.444 --> 11:55.913
 from Liberia is the very young
        Liberian soldier

11:55.948 --> 11:57.982
    who is jumping for joy,
    he just hit his target.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.086
That picture,
 I'm still not quite sure

12:02.121 --> 12:04.255
    what it means, you know,
   it has an ambiguity to me

12:04.290 --> 12:07.959
     that is still kind of,
    I'm exploring, I think.

12:07.994 --> 12:12.130
     Does it celebrate war
    or is it something else?

12:12.165 --> 12:14.265
            I think
   a lot of different people
  would bring different things

12:14.300 --> 12:15.399
     away from that picture

12:15.435 --> 12:17.802
    and even I haven't quite
 figured out what it all means.

12:24.510 --> 12:30.214
I remember
 looking at all the pictures
 that came out of Liberia.

12:30.249 --> 12:30.915
         It was mayhem.

12:32.251 --> 12:38.423
 And I think Chris spent a lot
 of time through his actions...

12:44.030 --> 12:47.866
     ...deeply empathizing
          with people
     and their conditions.

12:50.036 --> 12:55.039
       And really wanted
     the world to empathize
  with their conditions, too.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.048
There was about
  maybe 10 photographers

13:04.083 --> 13:06.484
     that pitched up there,
   and we started saturating

13:06.519 --> 13:09.253
      the news with images
         from the war.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.168
 Suddenly, the UN got involved
       and held hearings

13:24.203 --> 13:26.304
     and started assembling
     a peacekeeping force.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.039
       I mean, there was
    a real cause and effect.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.328
Did Chris ever talk
 to you about why he felt

13:50.363 --> 13:53.998
     it was so important to
   go cover these conflicts?

13:54.033 --> 13:58.569
 Well, I told him a few stories
you see when they were children,
            you see.

13:58.604 --> 14:03.074
     And they always said,
       "Mom, tell a story
about your childhood," you see.

14:03.109 --> 14:07.111
  So, in the evenings I would
     then tell them stories
       the way I grew up.

14:07.146 --> 14:11.282
    You see, it was totally
     different than it was
      here in the States.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.484
Four thousand planes
 smashed the Atlantic wall...

14:13.519 --> 14:16.087
When the war started,
  Second World War,

14:16.122 --> 14:18.890
  it creeped closer and closer
     into the small towns.

14:20.259 --> 14:22.393
  So I told him some stories.

14:22.428 --> 14:25.429
    Planes being shot down,
  and then they were burning,
            you see,

14:25.464 --> 14:29.267
   and then people jumped out
     and things like that.

14:37.944 --> 14:40.211
         How 'bout you,
    Chris, what scares you?

14:40.246 --> 14:41.045
            Nothing.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.947
             Sure.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.015
Yeah.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.049
  But what really scares you?

14:46.252 --> 14:47.252
 Nothing really does scare me.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.556
He was always
a very independent, self assured

14:52.591 --> 14:54.091
   already when he was small.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.526
       And I don't know.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.930
      Maybe genes, maybe,
         I don't know.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.431
You knew that he was going to be

15:00.466 --> 15:03.367
 a photographer, right, I mean,
      was it clear to you?

15:03.402 --> 15:07.471
Uh, yeah, he was
 always talking about that.

15:07.506 --> 15:10.975
My husband was very, very upset
     and I told my husband,

15:11.010 --> 15:15.446
   I said, "Zip it, whatever
   he wants to do, he will do

15:15.481 --> 15:16.314
     and leave him alone."

15:17.750 --> 15:22.987
  It was very important to me
          and I said,
   "You have the opportunity,

15:23.022 --> 15:27.959
      you have the means,
      you have everything
  here, what we did not have."

15:27.994 --> 15:31.395
       You see, I grew up
     in the turmoil there.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.964
     What we did not have.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.532
       I said, "use it."

15:42.341 --> 15:46.043
Chris and I were so intent
 on becoming journalists

15:46.078 --> 15:48.646
       that we oftentimes
    would try to skip ahead

15:48.681 --> 15:51.549
    of what we were learning
   in college and just go out
           and do it.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.620
 Our first assignment together

15:56.655 --> 15:59.657
  was to cover Bill Clinton's
     inauguration in 1993.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.627
    He calls me up and says,
 "Come on, let's go cover this
  for the student newspaper."

16:03.662 --> 16:07.164
    We arrived in Washington
   without press credentials

16:07.199 --> 16:10.001
   or even the proper attire
     to be able to get into

16:10.036 --> 16:12.169
       an inaugural ball
        to get the story

16:12.204 --> 16:16.040
    that we needed, so Chris
    managed to bluff his way

16:16.075 --> 16:19.543
      into securing a pair
      of all-access passes

16:19.578 --> 16:23.647
  and I managed to break into
    my dead uncle's wardrobe

16:23.682 --> 16:28.519
     and steal a couple of
    hugely oversized shirts

16:28.554 --> 16:30.054
        and sport coats.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.123
        But we ended up
     getting into the ball

16:32.158 --> 16:34.525
      and getting the shot
        that we needed,

16:34.560 --> 16:36.361
  so it worked out perfectly.

16:41.534 --> 16:45.436
Chris hired me as an intern
 after I got out of college.

16:45.471 --> 16:48.773
       I immediately saw,
     I was really surprised
       how young he was.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.008
            I mean,
   here's a guy who's my age.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.277
   He was chief photographer
          at a paper.

16:53.312 --> 16:56.213
       Um, however small
       the newspaper was,
 he was still running the show.

16:56.248 --> 17:00.551
   You know, police scanners
   always on next to his bed,

17:00.586 --> 17:05.589
    chasing every single bit
          of spot news
   that there was out there.

17:05.624 --> 17:09.026
The first very sophomoric thing
 a young photographer does

17:09.060 --> 17:11.095
 is look at National Geographic
            and say,

17:11.130 --> 17:14.031
         "Oh, my gosh,
 I could shoot those pictures."

17:14.066 --> 17:18.536
 Chris was pretty adamant that
        he was gonna go
     shoot those pictures.

17:18.570 --> 17:24.141
And that he was gonna figure out
the transit route to go do that.

17:24.175 --> 17:27.678
Working in a small
 daily newspaper in America

17:27.713 --> 17:30.347
            to going
and covering international wars

17:30.382 --> 17:35.553
is a pretty big step and there's
     no instruction manual

17:35.588 --> 17:38.255
      to kind of tell you
         how to do it.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.592
    Just to sell everything
      and go off to Kosovo

17:41.627 --> 17:45.329
   is a bit of a risky move,
       but we were ready
       to make that jump.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.770
    Being really ambitious,
     young, inexperienced,

17:52.805 --> 17:56.240
     you don't really have
        the proper idea
       of how much danger

17:56.275 --> 17:59.110
   you're putting yourself in
      and it's very common

17:59.145 --> 18:01.745
       to just think that
   nothing can happen to you,

18:01.780 --> 18:04.381
    that you're an observer
 and somehow that protects you.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.717
 But when there's actual combat
           going on,

18:06.752 --> 18:09.153
     that is the only thing
       that teaches you,

18:09.188 --> 18:12.356
  this is what it really means
          to be here.

18:14.126 --> 18:18.796
         This is where
    you really start to see
    what people are made of

18:18.831 --> 18:22.466
   and I could see what Chris
   was made of and was clear
   that this wasn't gonna be

18:22.501 --> 18:25.303
    the last trip to Kosovo
  or any other place for him.

18:27.806 --> 18:32.109
    Well, to be very honest,
   he was there three times,
            I heard.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.278
 But we only knew of one time.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.281
    He said, "I didn't want
      to worry you guys."

18:37.316 --> 18:40.851
     I was always trusting
     his judgment, you see.

18:40.886 --> 18:44.722
So, when I didn't hear from him
 for two or three weeks or so,

18:44.757 --> 18:45.823
       well, he was busy.

19:28.267 --> 19:30.601
Getty Images
  wanted to start
  a news wire service.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.871
        We were looking
       to make a splash,

19:33.906 --> 19:36.574
    we were looking to make
  our mark in the news scene.

19:36.609 --> 19:42.580
  He brought that higher level
    of photography with him.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.583
      It really influenced
  all the other photographers

19:45.618 --> 19:47.751
        who were working
    with Getty at the time.

19:47.786 --> 19:50.588
       You could call it
     the "Hondros effect".

19:50.623 --> 19:52.356
The early days of Getty,

19:52.391 --> 19:54.858
  we were really the only wire
   that was doing something,

19:54.893 --> 19:55.892
trying to do something different

19:55.928 --> 19:58.262
       and kind of fresh
  and certainly more creative

19:58.297 --> 20:01.332
  in a broader interpretation
   of what a news photograph

20:01.367 --> 20:02.934
         is and can be.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.540
The absolute key for us
 in starting our news business

20:09.575 --> 20:12.777
       was that we wanted
       the photographers
       to tell the story.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.447
    And in talking to Chris,
         that's exactly

20:16.482 --> 20:19.617
   what he was doing and what
he really, really wanted to do.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.586
   He wanted that flexibility
        and that ability

20:22.621 --> 20:24.922
       to tell the story
       the way he saw it.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.259
          And for him,
   the story was always about

20:28.294 --> 20:31.295
   the people being impacted
        by the conflict

20:31.330 --> 20:35.766
 or by the disaster as opposed
    to the disaster itself.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.635
We have
  a breaking news story
  to tell you about,

20:37.670 --> 20:40.271
          apparently,
    a plane has just crashed

20:40.306 --> 20:42.773
  into the World Trade Center
     here in New York City.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.576
        It happened just
 a few moments ago apparently.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.345
 The morning of September 11th,
       I got a phone call

20:48.380 --> 20:51.415
       from Chris saying,
 "Turn on the television set."

20:51.450 --> 20:54.418
...a great deal of concern.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.620
"You've gotta
  quit your job today,

20:56.655 --> 20:57.822
        you should come
     to New York tonight."

20:59.158 --> 21:03.961
  I was holding a baby bottle
      or changing a diaper
          or something

21:03.996 --> 21:07.765
 and I thought a lot about how

21:08.767 --> 21:10.401
       our lives diverged
         at that point.

21:12.838 --> 21:16.807
I'll never forget
 it was some days after 9/11

21:16.842 --> 21:20.911
     and we were, you know,
       all in the office,
  we were working crazy hours

21:20.946 --> 21:25.482
    and suddenly I get word
   that Hondros is on a plane
          to Pakistan.

21:25.517 --> 21:26.584
    And I just said, "What?"

21:27.686 --> 21:29.287
     I hadn't even thought
        about Pakistan.

21:32.691 --> 21:35.826
He was probably
 a half step ahead of us

21:35.861 --> 21:39.296
   in terms of where was this
       story going next,

21:39.331 --> 21:41.799
         where was this
gonna be happening, so, usually,

21:41.834 --> 21:43.701
       he would just call
    in the morning and say,

21:43.736 --> 21:46.036
  "Hey, this is what I'm doing
        rather than wait

21:46.071 --> 21:48.339
        for anyone to go
    and send him anywhere."

21:50.709 --> 21:54.545
Really, inevitably, that moment
   was the beginning of Chris
          just going.

21:56.415 --> 22:00.884
       There was nothing
        to turn him back
   and for the next 10 years,

22:00.919 --> 22:01.686
  that's all he did, he went.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.888
         From then on,
  I was seeing Chris' work on

22:04.923 --> 22:06.857
  the cover of every newspaper
         in the world.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.899
Do you know what spot news is?

22:15.934 --> 22:19.503
           You know,
    spot news is car crash,
        bomb blows up...

22:21.373 --> 22:22.773
   ...plane into a building.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.943
           The photos
   from that specific day...

22:29.148 --> 22:31.415
     have a lot of impact,
       a lot of emotion.

22:32.851 --> 22:39.757
       But I think Chris
     was deeply interested
  in how the story transpired.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.126
  What wisdom are we supposed
      to derive from this?

22:44.129 --> 22:47.565
     And I think Chris felt
   a responsibility to answer
   a lot of those questions.

23:10.989 --> 23:12.089
When the invasion started,

23:12.124 --> 23:16.126
     I rented a SUV and...

23:16.161 --> 23:18.596
  and drove across the border
           into Iraq.

23:19.998 --> 23:22.599
        Entering Baghdad
when the city was going to fall

23:22.634 --> 23:25.702
      would be of supreme
     historical importance.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.504
      You want to be there
      when that happened.

23:27.539 --> 23:30.474
  And in fact, we came across
     another couple of SUVs

23:30.509 --> 23:32.576
     with another couple of
      Newsweek journalists

23:32.611 --> 23:35.179
    who were also hell-bent
    on making it to Baghdad

23:35.214 --> 23:36.447
      before anybody else.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.484
Shot for a few days, no problem.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.653
   Followed the main highway
that was leading towards Baghdad

23:42.688 --> 23:45.656
which was a long snaking column

23:45.691 --> 23:48.526
 of American armored vehicles,
    hundreds of miles long.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.863
  I should have taken my time
     with it, I should have
        just stayed back

23:52.898 --> 23:55.466
  and slowly inched my way up,
  but I was a little bit eager

23:55.501 --> 23:58.469
 and I'd driven up on day three
           of the war

23:58.504 --> 23:59.770
   about halfway to Baghdad.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.072
           You know,
 it was a very calm afternoon,

24:02.107 --> 24:03.807
     nothing was going on,
     we were just following

24:03.842 --> 24:07.444
      a convoy of Marines
         and there was
    absolutely no fighting,

24:07.479 --> 24:10.647
    there was no resistance
          whatsoever.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.683
    The only disappointment
      was the Marine unit

24:12.718 --> 24:15.452
  that we'd ended up following
      was being diverted,

24:15.487 --> 24:19.089
          so there was
     another Marine convoy

24:19.124 --> 24:21.458
       maybe two or three
        kilometers ahead

24:21.493 --> 24:23.460
          and we tried
      to hook up with them

24:23.495 --> 24:26.530
     which meant traveling
 those two or three kilometers
       in no man's land,

24:26.565 --> 24:29.533
      so to speak, without
     any convoy protection.

24:29.568 --> 24:31.668
We are now gonna talk
  to Chris Hondros,

24:31.703 --> 24:34.805
   the infamous photographer
       with Getty Images.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.541
      So, Chris, tell us,
     what are you thinking?

24:37.576 --> 24:41.545
  I'm thinking that I'm amazed
 that they're letting us drive
      this deep into Iraq.

24:41.580 --> 24:45.716
On the right side,
  I remember there was
 a very large gas station

24:45.751 --> 24:50.521
  and I just remember hearing,
       you know, gunfire,

24:50.556 --> 24:54.858
       and I looked over
     and there was at least
    10 to 15 Iraqi soldiers,

24:54.893 --> 24:57.728
all in fatigues, shooting at us.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.197
  The tires on the right side
           of the car
   were completely blown out

25:00.232 --> 25:02.533
and so we're traveling on rims.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.204
  And then we ditched the car,
     grabbed what we could,

25:07.239 --> 25:14.811
       and we're so lost
     on an Iraqi farm field
 as night fell for an evening.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.246
          It was bad.

25:16.281 --> 25:20.017
     Chris was on the phone
      with his Getty folks

25:20.052 --> 25:24.221
back in New York who were being
  advised by Marine commanders

25:24.256 --> 25:26.523
  to hunker down, dig a hole,

25:26.558 --> 25:27.224
  and wait until the morning.

25:28.794 --> 25:33.797
   I thought it was a really
    bad idea because you're
   basically a sitting duck.

25:33.832 --> 25:38.068
It...
   It was, uh...
 It was hard to convince Chris.

25:38.103 --> 25:42.539
      He, he was dead set
        on staying put.

25:42.574 --> 25:45.776
 He was in this tunnel thinking
       that this is what
       he's going to do.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.044
     That's how it's going
       to resolve itself,

25:47.079 --> 25:52.616
by staying in a hole and waiting
 to be rescued in the morning.

25:52.651 --> 25:53.984
      I kept saying, well,
         come morning,

25:54.019 --> 25:56.219
  everyone's going to be able
          to see you,
     including the Iraqis.

25:56.254 --> 25:57.955
   They're going to find you,

25:57.990 --> 26:01.758
    they're going to follow
  the footprints in the sand.

26:01.793 --> 26:06.163
 I think that sort of convinced
       him that that was
      the wrong decision.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.266
 When I tell you "convincing",
  I had to literally grab him
         by his collar,

26:09.301 --> 26:14.037
  by his shirt, and shake him
and I was like slapping his face

26:14.072 --> 26:17.074
      because we felt like
 you cannot stay in the desert.

26:17.109 --> 26:20.978
   You have to come with us,
        we're taking you
  whether you like it or not.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.981
      And so, we walked in
     the complete darkness
       for 10 kilometers.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.349
       Took us about six
        or seven hours,

26:26.652 --> 26:29.119
          and made it
    to an army staging area.

26:30.255 --> 26:34.257
         It also ended
      my drive to Baghdad

26:34.292 --> 26:38.095
   because I lost the truck,
   I lost a lot of equipment
           and gear.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.298
    So, I stayed with those
   soldiers who picked us up

26:41.333 --> 26:43.667
         for a few days
      but basically then,

26:43.702 --> 26:46.169
      they had helicopters
      that were going back
          on refueling

26:46.204 --> 26:47.771
   and I got on one of those

26:47.806 --> 26:49.940
 with my tail between my legs.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.176
We were stuck in the desert
  for three days.

26:53.211 --> 26:55.312
 There was a raging sand storm.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.149
   You couldn't see anything
       but you could see

26:59.184 --> 27:04.655
 Chris Hondros' titanium white,
     iridescent turtleneck.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.325
   You know Egyptian cotton.

27:10.829 --> 27:11.729
       So typical Chris.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.165
I pushed it too far.

27:17.235 --> 27:22.172
I thought that we actually just
 drove on protected light SUVs
       across the border.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.741
  It's incomprehensible to me.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.377
      I mean I think Chris
    and I were really stupid

27:27.412 --> 27:28.846
        to get ourselves
       in that situation.

27:30.348 --> 27:32.015
   Photojournalists in order
          to survive,

27:32.050 --> 27:35.352
  we need a level of arrogance
         and I felt it,

27:35.387 --> 27:37.854
   I see it in my colleagues,
   and I've seen it in Chris.

27:37.889 --> 27:39.823
    I have a very good sense
     that he felt this way.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.793
      A very high, supreme
   confidence in his ability

27:42.828 --> 27:44.127
     to survive everything.

27:44.162 --> 27:44.895
          A cockiness.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.898
        Who doesn't feel
      that way sometimes.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.701
 You cover dozens of conflicts,
        multiple times,

27:50.736 --> 27:52.736
  multiple things and nothing
         happens to you

27:52.771 --> 27:54.671
or when things do happen to you,

27:54.706 --> 27:57.941
     you're able to, like,
      brush off your pants
         and walk away.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.279
Chris definitely
 had a tolerance for risk

28:02.314 --> 28:04.247
    that I just don't have.

28:04.282 --> 28:07.084
  And I wasn't, I don't know,
    I wasn't born with that.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.720
He could be, I don't want to use
      the word "cavalier,"

28:09.755 --> 28:12.856
           but he had
   this incredible optimism.

28:14.926 --> 28:16.226
   He was done, he was gonna
      go home for a while

28:16.261 --> 28:18.028
   and chill out and recover.

28:18.063 --> 28:21.398
  So I drove him from Baghdad
  down to the southern border

28:21.433 --> 28:24.034
 and we see a sign for the town

28:24.069 --> 28:28.138
    where they were shot up
   and I'll never forget it.

28:28.173 --> 28:30.974
   He looks at me, he's like,
    "Let's just take a spin
      through the market,

28:31.009 --> 28:34.745
    I bet you my SAT phone,
          we can find
   my cameras and SAT phone."

28:34.780 --> 28:38.081
     And I just immediately
 gunned it just to, like, 120,

28:38.116 --> 28:39.883
          just pretend
     I never even heard it,
     Chris, didn't hear it.

28:58.336 --> 29:03.373
I think we was a great coper,
  if that's even a word.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.142
Because he had such a rich life.

29:07.345 --> 29:08.511
I didn't have to worry about him

29:08.546 --> 29:12.315
         because I knew
       that he was always
      engaging with people

29:12.350 --> 29:14.251
  in ways that let him process
          what he saw.

29:16.054 --> 29:19.823
 Well, Chris is the type of guy
         that you just
      became friends with

29:19.858 --> 29:22.526
          really fast
     and he's really open.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.162
        And he actually,
     one of the things that

29:25.197 --> 29:28.465
   I didn't really understand
          about Chris

29:28.500 --> 29:34.504
    until much later in our
 friendship was that the scope
    of friends that he had.

29:34.539 --> 29:37.440
        Whether they're
     translators, drivers,
 friends he met along the way,

29:37.475 --> 29:39.976
 doesn't matter who they were,

29:40.011 --> 29:43.079
        he actually put
  an incredible amount of work

29:43.114 --> 29:47.350
    and energy into staying
   connected to those people.

29:47.385 --> 29:51.522
     And he really had this
   global presence about him.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.892
Chris is one of these guys
  that just could really

29:55.927 --> 29:57.961
 have the world open its doors
            to him.

29:57.996 --> 30:01.431
     He had a just, always
    had a smile on his face,

30:01.466 --> 30:03.967
        was very curious
       about everything.

30:04.002 --> 30:06.536
           You know,
   he would just win friends,
           you know,

30:06.571 --> 30:08.271
   and if you're going to be
 successful at this profession,

30:08.306 --> 30:09.506
 you have to have that ability.

30:11.877 --> 30:16.880
Chris was always very
 interested in relationships.

30:16.915 --> 30:21.585
        He would travel
   around the globe watering,

30:21.620 --> 30:24.488
        but essentially
    nurturing relationships.

30:26.391 --> 30:29.926
He was just like that,
  and you feel so often

30:29.961 --> 30:33.897
   that when you're in these
    environments and you're,
   you know, you're sharing,

30:33.932 --> 30:35.465
          I don't want
     to say you're taking,
       but you're sharing

30:35.500 --> 30:38.335
   these moments with people,
you get to go home to your life.

30:39.971 --> 30:41.905
        And you know you
   leave these people behind

30:41.940 --> 30:43.207
      and their situations
     that they can't leave.

30:46.978 --> 30:51.381
           He wanted
    to somehow do something
     about that for people

30:51.416 --> 30:54.885
  and give them an opportunity
     that they would never
        otherwise have.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.923
Ladies and gentlemen,
 very warm welcome to Monrovia.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.113
          Joseph, hey.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.348
       Good to meet you.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.049
       Nice to meet you.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.418
         -How are you?
           -I'm fine.

31:28.453 --> 31:30.287
          Good, good.
 Thank you for meeting with us.

31:31.990 --> 31:33.090
          -Go inside?
       -Thank you, yeah.

31:37.128 --> 31:39.229
Wow, are these all shrapnel
   or bullets?

31:39.264 --> 31:41.565
These are RPG and these ones
   are bullets.

31:43.068 --> 31:43.967
Wow.

32:31.349 --> 32:34.017
        I never sort of
  connected with that fighter,

32:34.052 --> 32:36.386
  and as the picture got used
      all over the world,

32:36.421 --> 32:39.522
        people asked me
      if I knew his story
       or how old he was,

32:39.557 --> 32:42.158
  whether he survived the war,
      anything like that,
       and I didn't know.

32:42.193 --> 32:45.061
  I didn't realize the impact
 the picture was going to have.

32:45.096 --> 32:48.031
   But my colleague at Getty,
         Spencer Platt,

32:48.066 --> 32:50.500
   ended up going to Liberia
      a month or two later

32:50.535 --> 32:54.304
         and he told me
   that he was driving around

32:54.339 --> 32:59.209
in an area and saw that fighter
   you know, running around,

32:59.244 --> 33:01.044
     so he was pretty sure
     that he had survived.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.145
 I said, "Well, how do you know
          it was him?"

33:02.180 --> 33:04.247
  He said, "Well, I recognized
     him from the picture.

33:04.282 --> 33:06.383
  And also he had the printout
   from the weekend pictures

33:06.418 --> 33:09.185
       on MSNBC taped to
  his windshield of his truck,
           you know.

33:09.220 --> 33:13.323
        He was extremely
     proud of that picture
of him in the middle of battle.

33:13.358 --> 33:16.626
     So, a few years later,
   when I went back to cover

33:16.661 --> 33:20.030
the Liberian elections in 2005,

33:20.065 --> 33:23.299
    I thought that for sure
I should try to track him down.

33:33.378 --> 33:35.012
         Said, "Look...

34:44.382 --> 34:47.184
How much education
  had you had already
   at that point?

35:37.669 --> 35:40.236
    You know there's a line
      that says, you know,

35:40.271 --> 35:43.506
     "If you kill one man,
   you kill all of humanity",

35:43.541 --> 35:44.540
       I'm paraphrasing.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.143
      If you save one man,
   you save all of humanity.

35:47.178 --> 35:50.580
      I think that that's
       the way Chris was.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.918
     He nurtured all of his
  relationships that same way.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.331
     I will need you back.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.471
There's so many people
  here in the church
  and everything.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.240
"Aren't you worried?" I said.

36:17.275 --> 36:19.842
   "Even if I worry, you see,
        there's nothing
       going to change."

36:19.877 --> 36:24.514
I cannot tell him, you stay home
 because I'm worried, you see.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.682
      You cannot do that.

36:25.717 --> 36:26.550
Wait!

36:28.386 --> 36:31.187
           Smoke it!
   Down the street, hurry up!

36:31.222 --> 36:33.423
      Smoke it! Smoke it!

36:33.458 --> 36:34.757
The only thing
 that I always told him,

36:34.792 --> 36:36.693
  I said, "Please be careful."

36:36.728 --> 36:38.661
        A picture is not
        worth your life.

36:38.696 --> 36:42.199
He said, "Oh, Mom, don't worry,
   I'm careful, I'm careful."

36:48.806 --> 36:52.208
Most people went to Iraq
 in 2003 and that was it,
  the war was over.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.210
        Chris went back
       every single year,

36:54.245 --> 36:55.879
      patrol after patrol
         after patrol.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.851
I mean, very few journalists
  are in Iraq anymore.

37:01.886 --> 37:02.852
And to me it's incomprehensible.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.756
I understand that on some level,
   it's extremely dangerous.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.425
 On the other hand, it is such
 a critically important story.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.329
    It is the foreign story
     of our time bar none.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.567
He was dedicated
  to telling that story.

37:17.602 --> 37:21.638
        And he would go
    when it was 120 degrees,

37:21.673 --> 37:24.341
  he would go when nobody else
     wanted to go anymore.

37:26.678 --> 37:30.747
           You know,
   actually, psychologically,
 he was figuring this story out

37:30.782 --> 37:32.915
   but it would start kind of
    creeping over the wire,

37:32.950 --> 37:36.319
         he was getting
       closer and closer.

37:37.322 --> 37:40.356
 And then just out of the blue,
         took an image

37:40.391 --> 37:43.860
or series of images that became
     the defining pictures
         of that event.

37:46.331 --> 37:47.630
I wanted to go
  to downtown Mosul,

37:47.665 --> 37:48.664
      I was really on him
    about it and they said,

37:48.700 --> 37:51.601
  "Well, we're gonna send you
       out to Tal Afar."

37:51.636 --> 37:53.903
          And I said,
  "What the hell is Tal Afar?
 I've never even heard of it."

37:53.938 --> 37:56.372
 And they said, "Well, we have
   a really important mission

37:56.407 --> 37:57.840
      going on over there,
you're really going to like it."

37:57.875 --> 38:02.045
  Usually when they say that,
         it's gonna be
   some glacial boring thing.

38:02.080 --> 38:06.616
So I get flown out to Tal Afar,
     this dusty field base
   in the middle of nowhere.

38:06.651 --> 38:08.584
I was actually
walking up to the platoon leader

38:08.619 --> 38:11.654
  and the platoon leader said,
"Hey, this is our imbed today."

38:11.689 --> 38:12.989
    And I was like, "Great."

38:13.024 --> 38:15.491
 I always gave the journalists
            a brief,

38:15.526 --> 38:18.428
      "OK, do me a favor,
   do what I tell you to do."

38:18.463 --> 38:19.762
        "If you don't do
     what I tell you to do,

38:19.797 --> 38:21.331
    I can't keep you alive."

38:22.400 --> 38:24.867
      Chris' response was,
       he's like, "Well,

38:24.902 --> 38:27.537
      my first priority's
      the pictures, man."

38:27.572 --> 38:29.839
I was like, "OK,
 you're gonna get my ass shot."

38:29.874 --> 38:31.074
      But I liked the guy.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.945
I got with one unit
 that seemed to be pretty good,

38:35.980 --> 38:37.547
      the Apache Company.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.716
    Anyway they were pretty
  press-friendly, these guys,

38:39.751 --> 38:42.686
         and so we went
  on a late afternoon patrol.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.857
    The streets were empty,

38:47.892 --> 38:50.626
           there was
  a sort of curfew in effect,
   it was a very tense town.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.362
       But a car appeared
        in the distance

38:53.531 --> 38:55.932
and started coming toward them.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.902
      And, you know, they,
soldiers in Iraq don't let cars
       come towards them.

38:59.937 --> 39:02.372
            I mean,
they just don't let that happen

39:02.407 --> 39:05.742
      because of the fears
      of bombs and things.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.510
Chris and I were,
 you know, standing there.

39:07.545 --> 39:10.012
  I saw Chris taking pictures
        off to my right

39:10.047 --> 39:12.849
     and we heard the roar
         of an engine,

39:12.884 --> 39:13.883
      like "What the hell
         is going on?"

39:15.420 --> 39:16.886
       We knew something
      was going to happen.

39:16.921 --> 39:18.388
        We just knew it.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.657
   We gave 'em warning shots,
       two warning shots.

39:21.692 --> 39:22.892
   That's one more than usual

39:23.928 --> 39:26.496
and they sped up.

39:28.099 --> 39:32.001
   So company commander says,
        "Stop that car,
    somebody stop that car."

39:32.036 --> 39:34.370
So, it was open fire, you know.

39:34.405 --> 39:37.040
       And it was 20 guys

39:38.476 --> 39:40.443
      pulling the trigger
     as fast as they could.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.082
     We're putting down 18,
       20 rounds a piece

39:46.117 --> 39:50.153
into this vehicle before it was
   a, "Ceasefire, ceasefire."

39:51.789 --> 39:52.722
     That's a lot of ammo.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.493
Sure enough,
 I hear children's voices

39:57.528 --> 40:00.596
    as they stopped the car
  and I knew it was a family.

40:00.631 --> 40:03.466
   Back door's open and kids
  just tumble out of the car,

40:03.501 --> 40:05.735
 just one after one after one,
     there were six in all.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.573
        And the parents
      sitting in the front

40:10.608 --> 40:12.742
 were just riddled with bullets
     and killed instantly.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.924
I was like "Oh, my God.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.561
What did we do, what did we do?"

40:36.000 --> 40:40.470
   I saw this one little girl
          and she had
  a lot of blood on her face.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.975
She could have been my daughter.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.523
The children in the back
 were incredibly enough OK

41:00.558 --> 41:02.559
  except one of them was shot
        to the abdomen.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.828
Chris was there, he saw it.

41:05.863 --> 41:08.498
  He had the presence of mind
       to take the photos

41:08.533 --> 41:11.033
    and to insist that those
      images were released

41:11.068 --> 41:14.570
    even though the military
     were not keen on that.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.639
The Major wanted me
 to hold onto the photos

41:16.674 --> 41:18.040
    for a few days, he said,
      "Yeah, we appreciate

41:18.075 --> 41:19.842
  if you didn't send those out
         for a few days

41:19.877 --> 41:21.211
        until we've done
      our investigation."

41:22.680 --> 41:24.680
       And I said, "Well,
   I have to talk to my boss

41:24.715 --> 41:26.582
 but I think, you know, we want
 to work with you there, Major,

41:26.617 --> 41:29.485
   so I think we can probably
    do something like that.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.953
          Let me check
   but I think we'll be OK."

41:30.988 --> 41:34.657
 Again, I'm being very casual,
           very cool.

41:34.692 --> 41:37.059
       And then I stepped
       out of his office

41:37.094 --> 41:40.963
   and ran back to my trailer
   and hooked up my SAT phone

41:40.998 --> 41:43.966
    and got all the pictures
       and looked at them

41:44.001 --> 41:45.668
       and I said "Whoa",
  I couldn't believe how much

41:45.703 --> 41:48.170
     information was there,
like the pictures did come out.

41:48.205 --> 41:49.839
   "I need to get these back
          to New York

41:49.874 --> 41:51.340
   before something happens."

41:51.376 --> 41:54.143
I mean they have the capability
to, like, jam all communications
           from base

41:54.178 --> 41:56.846
including my personal SAT phone,
           you know.

41:56.881 --> 41:58.848
And I said,
 "OK, send, send, send 'em up,

41:58.883 --> 42:03.152
   send 'em up, send 'em up,
  quickly, quickly, quickly."

42:03.187 --> 42:04.754
     So I sent 20 pictures,

42:05.756 --> 42:08.925
 and then, whew, got them out.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.728
      Close the SAT phone,
      close the computer.

42:19.637 --> 42:22.572
The impact of the Tal Afar
photos was immediate, you know.

42:22.607 --> 42:25.207
There had been obviously reports
        through the war

42:25.242 --> 42:27.009
 of things like that happening
       but there had been

42:27.044 --> 42:28.311
  no visual proof if you will.

42:29.747 --> 42:32.548
   Those photographs brought
      a problem that might

42:32.583 --> 42:33.816
        have been murky
       into sharp relief.

42:35.586 --> 42:38.721
       They ran globally
        for days on end.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.992
 And then afterward, you know,
        Chris got kicked
       out of the imbed.

42:44.762 --> 42:47.964
I just did a book on
  Iraq, Iraq was my war.

42:47.999 --> 42:51.567
  I mean, I spent years there
  and really covered the war.

42:51.602 --> 42:56.305
   And I think the one photo
that reached the American public

42:56.340 --> 43:00.676
  out of that entire conflict
 is Chris' photo from Tal Afar.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.012
Something Chris said about
 the Tal Afar photographs

43:03.047 --> 43:06.916
  was that this was something
         that happened
     all the time in Iraq,

43:06.951 --> 43:09.652
  he just happened to be there
       when it happened.

43:10.655 --> 43:14.991
And the Tal Afar images, again,

43:15.026 --> 43:18.828
  it's just this intersection
    of lives that, you know,

43:18.863 --> 43:21.764
       when it was over,
     everybody was changed.

43:29.807 --> 43:31.974
I believe that it was
a very traumatic event for Chris

43:32.009 --> 43:34.910
and I think that that's probably

43:34.945 --> 43:39.315
   what led him to follow up
        and get involved

43:39.350 --> 43:42.652
   with a young boy who came
    over here for treatment.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.355
That boy who was shot,
  he ended up being,

43:46.390 --> 43:50.960
 on the basis of these photos,
    he ended up being flown
   to Boston for treatments.

43:50.995 --> 43:53.729
You know,
 he did a lot of that stuff
   on his own

43:53.764 --> 43:56.332
      to figure out a way
     to get Rakan to the US

43:56.367 --> 43:59.335
which is a very difficult thing
 to do in the middle of a war.

43:59.370 --> 44:02.805
   An Iraqi national had come
  to get help in this country
      for their injuries.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.377
When you have that connection,
   you know,

44:08.412 --> 44:09.945
 you don't have that connection
         with everybody

44:09.980 --> 44:12.948
    but Chris obviously had
     that with these people

44:12.983 --> 44:15.718
        and he put them
      on the world stage,

44:15.753 --> 44:18.354
  and I think he probably was
trying to protect them as well,

44:18.389 --> 44:21.657
           you know,
  making sure that they're OK.

44:21.692 --> 44:23.726
      And a lot of us just
   run through people's lives

44:23.761 --> 44:27.229
       and take pictures
        and we sometimes
         become famous

44:27.264 --> 44:30.700
  for that versus the subject
     and I think he wanted
          to make sure

44:30.735 --> 44:32.068
       that they were OK.

44:32.103 --> 44:36.305
   Chris, you are well known
   for this remarkable series

44:36.340 --> 44:38.240
  of photographs in Tal Afar,

44:38.275 --> 44:39.675
   describe the little girl,

44:39.710 --> 44:44.780
     this most famous image
       of the little girl
   next to a soldier's boots.

44:44.815 --> 44:48.150
Yeah.
  Her name as it turns out  is Samar, Samara Hassan

44:48.185 --> 44:51.921
   and she was five years old
  at the time of the picture.

44:51.956 --> 44:55.124
   I think one of the reasons
         the photo had
     the sort of resonance

44:55.159 --> 44:58.094
    that it does is because
it has a sort of empty feeling.

44:58.129 --> 45:01.797
    The poor girl all alone
        in the world now

45:01.832 --> 45:03.800
just standing there in the dark,
           you know.

45:13.477 --> 45:16.212
      Chris was reluctant
     to talk about details

45:16.247 --> 45:19.115
        of his work when
   he was covering conflicts.

45:19.150 --> 45:22.384
   He would much rather talk
 about his music, for example,

45:22.419 --> 45:26.055
      or the latest novel
         that he read.

45:26.090 --> 45:28.924
Well, I'm sure a lot of people
 would say this about Chris

45:28.959 --> 45:31.861
        but he was able
      to go to the places

45:31.896 --> 45:37.133
     he had gone to and do
      the work that he did

45:37.168 --> 45:40.937
  and still come back and have
 somewhat of a sane existence.

45:43.207 --> 45:48.377
    He knew the cost of war
 more than anybody but I never
     saw him talk about it.

45:48.412 --> 45:51.947
     You know, if anything,
      he made light of it.

45:51.982 --> 45:54.416
  Sometimes we'd discuss stuff
 and he'd say, "Hey, you know,

45:54.451 --> 45:57.319
  that's just the way it is,"
     and, boom, he was off
       on another subject

45:57.354 --> 45:58.587
      and you think, "Oh,

45:58.622 --> 46:00.523
we didn't have the conversation
 I thought we were gonna have."

46:03.227 --> 46:07.263
Chris and I would talk
 for hours and never talk
  about photography.

46:07.298 --> 46:08.197
   Chris talked about ideas.

46:09.633 --> 46:12.401
           In a way,
 that's the power of who he was
   and the power of his work.

46:12.436 --> 46:18.040
        Like, the camera
      is just an extension
of his psyche and his intellect.

46:18.075 --> 46:21.944
    He really encouraged me
    to be more introspective

46:21.979 --> 46:26.816
     but also be more aware
    of the world around you.

46:30.855 --> 46:34.824
 There was an intensity there,
            I mean,
  you could see it in his work

46:34.859 --> 46:37.993
         but outwardly
     he didn't take himself
         too seriously.

46:38.028 --> 46:40.396
      He had a perfect mix
    of intensity and levity

46:42.166 --> 46:47.403
because there's a bigger mission
     here and we'd have to
     keep focused on that.

46:52.543 --> 46:55.277
I have a career ahead of me,
 I can't let this kill me,

46:55.312 --> 46:59.048
    I can't come out of this
          so messed up

46:59.083 --> 47:01.284
       that I can't work
      from this point on.

47:02.620 --> 47:07.423
    So, while it is jarring
          to come back
   and going back and forth,

47:07.458 --> 47:11.026
     I do my best, to to...

47:11.061 --> 47:14.897
    have a normal life here
     and keep Iraq in Iraq.

47:17.067 --> 47:20.002
   I'm not going to let Iraq
      get the best of me.

47:20.037 --> 47:21.537
You know,
 I'm not going to do it.

47:23.507 --> 47:24.874
Hondros.

47:32.383 --> 47:34.316
I've been at this a while,
 and again, one of the reasons

47:34.351 --> 47:36.218
      I've lasted as long
      as I have is to keep

47:36.253 --> 47:40.356
           some level
     of distance and sanity
    from the whole process.

47:40.391 --> 47:42.424
        So for my part,
      what's fun in Iraq.

47:42.459 --> 47:44.994
Well, you know, the journalists
     all stay in this hotel

47:45.029 --> 47:46.562
 and we have parties, you know.

47:48.132 --> 47:49.599
      There is Joe Raedle.

47:51.402 --> 47:53.869
         The penthouse
     in the Al Hamra hotel

47:53.904 --> 47:58.874
     was actually a really
   nice place to come back to

47:58.909 --> 48:00.008
      when you'd been out
         in the field.

48:01.145 --> 48:04.179
   Not a luxurious penthouse
  but it was a nice penthouse.

48:04.214 --> 48:05.481
   Getty Images hard at work.

48:07.217 --> 48:09.485
Everybody knew Chris Hondros.
 He'd been there forever.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.353
    Um, they knew his work.

48:11.388 --> 48:13.389
Wow. Chicken!

48:13.424 --> 48:15.958
- Hondras.
   -Hondros!

48:15.993 --> 48:17.459
So we all hung out all the time.

48:17.494 --> 48:19.261
      Whether it be having
        dinner together,

48:19.296 --> 48:22.364
 we'd have a weekly poker game
        here and there,

48:22.399 --> 48:26.936
    and Chris was a presence
   at all of those evenings.

48:26.971 --> 48:30.039
     Classic Chris told me,
 "Oh, well, you should come by

48:30.074 --> 48:32.107
      the Getty apartment
        later tonight."

48:32.142 --> 48:35.444
    It was like we were back
   in New York or something.

48:35.479 --> 48:37.413
       That's pretty much
         how Chris was.

48:37.448 --> 48:39.248
 Everywhere he went, you know,

48:39.283 --> 48:42.518
      he was always trying
        to bring a sense
      of normalcy I think.

48:46.256 --> 48:47.957
Maestro, maestro.

48:54.198 --> 48:56.031
Chris called me up and he said,
  "Hey, you know,

48:56.066 --> 48:59.168
  I've got the concert master
   of the Pittsburgh Symphony

48:59.203 --> 49:01.337
   to play Bach's "Chaconne"

49:01.372 --> 49:05.107
    which is the single most
  important piece ever written
     for a solo instrument

49:05.142 --> 49:08.978
   in the history of music...
          supposedly."

49:14.151 --> 49:19.021
      And Chris presented
   a slideshow of seven years
      of his work in Iraq

49:19.056 --> 49:22.624
timed perfectly to the movements
       within the music.

50:04.201 --> 50:07.336
You know, you can't
 tell me Chris didn't have
  nightmares about it.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.540
            I smell
   what I smelled that night.

50:13.777 --> 50:17.413
         Blood, brains,
    I mean you ever smelled?

50:20.617 --> 50:21.283
      You can't forget it.

50:22.453 --> 50:25.187
     Other people came back
  and they were welcomed back

50:25.222 --> 50:27.790
        with, you know,
       hugs and what not,
      no, I mean, not me.

50:27.825 --> 50:29.191
       I couldn't relate.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.260
   All my friends went away.

50:32.596 --> 50:35.130
So who else could I relate with?

50:35.165 --> 50:38.401
 So I was like, you know what,
      let's contact Chris,
      see how he's doing.

50:40.370 --> 50:41.470
           And, uh...

50:42.739 --> 50:44.440
       And he came down.

50:44.475 --> 50:47.209
          He came down
  pretty lickety-split quick.

50:49.246 --> 50:52.247
Um, well, you know Chris and I,
         we're sort of,

50:52.282 --> 50:55.150
   we don't even really know
     what we're going to do

50:55.185 --> 50:57.419
    out of this if anything,
     so just kind of, like,

50:57.454 --> 51:00.756
  you know, we're just kind of
   chit chatting about stuff.

51:00.791 --> 51:03.225
    I guess it's irrelevant
     in that didn't you say

51:03.260 --> 51:05.360
  that one of your lieutenants
   said, "Take that car out?"

51:05.395 --> 51:06.728
   Or in that Captain Seabolt
           did say...

51:06.763 --> 51:08.163
       -The captain did.
       -"Stop that car."

51:08.198 --> 51:11.733
Do you think you
  were the only one
 shooting at the passenger?

51:11.768 --> 51:18.273
I feel fairly
 responsible for the majority
  of the injuries.

51:18.308 --> 51:20.676
I feel as though
 I killed the pregnant woman.

51:20.711 --> 51:21.710
          I feel that.

51:21.745 --> 51:25.181
 I feel I injured Rakan Hassan.

51:26.283 --> 51:28.451
          I feel that
   so that's what makes my...

51:35.826 --> 51:37.493
    You don't know for sure
          though that

51:37.528 --> 51:40.863
 yours was the only bullet that
   hit the wife in this case.

51:40.898 --> 51:42.231
No.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.833
You suspect that
 but, I mean, a lot of people
   were firing.

51:44.868 --> 51:46.769
You don't know that for certain.

51:49.941 --> 51:52.341
Every time I go and look
  at Chris' photos,

51:53.644 --> 51:55.111
   I have to see those ones.

51:55.913 --> 51:59.448
       Even though I know
   I'm gonna have nightmares.

51:59.483 --> 52:02.151
 I have nightmares every night.

52:03.787 --> 52:07.623
      It used to be so bad
         I'd see Rakan
    walking down the street.

52:07.658 --> 52:09.658
Did you follow what
 happened with him after that?

52:09.693 --> 52:12.861
Yeah, he went to
 Massachusetts I think it was,

52:12.896 --> 52:17.166
        and got surgery
      and now he can walk.

52:18.502 --> 52:19.201
Uh...

52:21.171 --> 52:21.837
            Does...

52:24.641 --> 52:27.176
      It does seem that...

52:28.812 --> 52:35.317
     he actually was killed
        in some sort of
  incident in Mosul actually.

52:35.352 --> 52:37.686
- Who, what, Rakan was?
-   -Mmm-hmm.

52:37.721 --> 52:41.190
There was some sort of
insurgent attack on their house

52:41.225 --> 52:44.393
      and Rakan was killed
      in that last summer.

52:46.730 --> 52:51.333
 I thought you might have heard
           about that
'cause I was published as well.

52:51.368 --> 52:52.034
No.

52:53.637 --> 52:56.438
   It was just, they weren't
  targeted or anything strange
     like that, were they?

52:56.473 --> 52:57.472
They do seem
  to have been targeted.

52:57.507 --> 52:58.507
Really?

53:07.751 --> 53:11.253
      Yeah, it was, it was
    a pretty good surprise.

53:11.288 --> 53:12.388
         I didn't know.

53:14.224 --> 53:18.527
   And it was because of what
   we had done that he died.

53:18.562 --> 53:19.528
             So...

53:26.603 --> 53:28.437
     I wanted to apologize.

53:28.472 --> 53:29.238
             Um...

53:32.376 --> 53:36.946
    No matter how many times
     you say you're sorry.

53:47.591 --> 53:48.424
             Sorry.

53:54.998 --> 53:58.233
If assuming that we have
  a chance to meet Samar

53:58.268 --> 54:00.769
        and her family,
       would you like us
  to pass that message along?

54:00.804 --> 54:01.971
          Absolutely.

54:03.507 --> 54:05.274
       Yeah, absolutely.

55:31.995 --> 55:34.563
I never asked Chris if he...

55:34.598 --> 55:37.599
           you know,
  regretted getting involved.

55:39.669 --> 55:40.336
             Yeah.

55:41.605 --> 55:45.474
     Yeah, that's, I mean,
  that's a question for Chris.
             Yeah.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.008
  We all make judgment calls.

55:47.043 --> 55:49.545
     We all feel compassion
       in different ways.

55:52.482 --> 55:57.085
    And obviously sometimes
        the consequences
    are beyond our control.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.987
And there was a lot
  of discussion about

55:59.022 --> 56:00.689
   whether or not journalists
        should do that.

56:02.826 --> 56:05.494
 Yeah, I think the only people
 that might be questioning that

56:05.529 --> 56:07.429
         are the people
    that haven't been there.

56:07.464 --> 56:10.732
    It's tough to walk away
       from a little girl

56:10.767 --> 56:15.437
  that's sitting in the middle
 of the blood of her relatives.

56:15.472 --> 56:18.507
         We're humans,
      we're not machines.

56:19.776 --> 56:20.642
             So...

56:25.882 --> 56:28.750
         When you talk
     about war being hell,
     this is what you mean.

56:28.785 --> 56:31.720
   It's not just battlefield
         type of stuff.

56:31.755 --> 56:34.623
     When any country says
    it's going to go to war,

56:34.658 --> 56:39.461
 these are the kinds of things
       that we can expect

56:39.496 --> 56:41.563
  because these are the things
      that happen in war.

57:05.155 --> 57:06.588
         Hello, Samar.

57:06.623 --> 57:08.557
      Does she understand
       that my friend was

57:08.592 --> 57:10.725
        the photographer
  who took the picture of her?

59:31.868 --> 59:34.235
You know I always think
 it's a lot more difficult

59:34.270 --> 59:36.037
       for photographers
 when we get into this business

59:36.072 --> 59:38.106
        of we don't want
   to talk about objectivity,

59:38.141 --> 59:38.840
    then certainly balance.

59:40.009 --> 59:42.611
  You know, a reporter can go
   into a situation and say,

59:42.646 --> 59:45.647
      "Well, I can always
        get both sides."

59:45.682 --> 59:48.149
       With a photograph,
       there really isn't

59:48.184 --> 59:51.052
        that kind of way
    to balance the picture.

59:51.087 --> 59:52.588
    Do you think about that?

59:53.023 --> 59:54.456
Sure.

59:54.491 --> 59:57.759
  Individual photos of course
    are difficult to balance
       in that same way.

59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.863
       On the other hand,
     I think on the whole,

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.833
  in terms of a body of work,
    it's possible to achieve

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.835
     that kind of balance,
     that kind of fairness.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:13.942
      I think in my work,
     in Iraq I've covered,

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:18.747
    I've been embedded with
     US soldiers, you know,
 for months and months on end.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.682
     I've been with Iraqis
        in their homes.

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:26.788
 You know, I've tried to cover
    every part of this story
   that's possible to cover,

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.690
    and I think if one looks
     at my work as a whole,

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:31.727
   you see that multifaceted
         aspect of it.

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:54.182
How do you get
 these amazing photographs

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.651
           and go to
    these incredible places

01:00:56.686 --> 01:01:01.356
where you internalize profoundly
     the human experience?

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:04.893
       I would always get
     a phone call from him

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:09.064
     and the conversations
     that we had very often

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:12.200
  were Chris on a mountaintop

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:16.738
   halfway across the world,
          um, lonely.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.676
        You know, he was
a globe-trotting, gallivanting,

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:25.914
         good looking,
      extremely articulate
     conflict photographer.

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:29.384
           I suppose
    many women imagined that

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:32.053
        this kind of fit
       their movie line,

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.288
     but it's a tough life.

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:39.894
Is it hard to have relationships
  in what you do?

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:43.698
   It's obviously difficult,
       I mean, we travel,
mostly because we travel a lot.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.334
  You know, when I go to Iraq,
            I go for
    about six weeks usually,

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.269
 and I'm gone at least every...

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:51.773
   two or three times a year
      since the war began.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.943
       On the other hand,
 I don't think it's impossible.

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:57.045
I mean there are a lot of people
      with consuming jobs

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.814
     and, you know, to me,
     holding a relationship

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.050
     is a personal decision
  and it has a lot of factors

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:05.220
     and this only just one
        of them really.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:08.957
I was always
  kind of nagging him,

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.260
            I said,
 "Chris, you're getting older,
        and believe me,

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:16.965
  because I said when you are
  by yourself, it stinks, OK?"

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.267
    And he said, "Yes, Mom,
     don't worry about it."

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:30.311
I don't think
that I had too many expectations

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:33.448
       upon meeting him,
it was through a friend of mine.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:36.417
       He was a bit quiet
    when I met him at first.

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:42.157
 So we had a lot of lunch dates
    and a lot of first dates
        it seemed like.

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:46.261
    And then all of sudden,
we just seemed to find our way.

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:52.167
When Chris met Christina,
   his fiancée,

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:56.771
          I think that
      he found the opening
    to the rest of his life

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:59.941
     and it was a path that
    he had been looking for

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:04.979
     in some way to justify
       changing the speed

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:07.182
          or changing
    the tempo of the things
  that he did professionally.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:15.089
We were very drawn to each other
   because we wanted a family

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:15.791
       and to live abroad

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:20.462
          and to have
     a very kind of curious
exciting life out in the world.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:26.467
I think he had been
  through 10 years

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:29.171
    of just missing the gear
       in a lot of ways.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:34.008
He yearned for a deep connection
         with somebody

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:37.111
   and I think he really had
    found it with Christina.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:41.183
     He was overjoyed that
   he had come to that place.

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:46.020
I had a background
  working with people

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:49.891
        that had worked
      in conflict regions,
      so there was always

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:52.560
a sense of awareness of the risk

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:55.530
      and what's involved
  but I believe very strongly

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.832
in the work photojournalists do

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.368
and I was OK with him being away

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:03.238
  and we always felt connected

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.875
       in different ways,
     so it didn't feel like
      a sacrifice at all.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:14.048
It was frustration
at Tunisia's youth unemployment
  that started it all.

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:15.884
Today, thousands of people
  took to the streets

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:18.186
  demanding change in Algeria.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:21.256
They brought
their grievances to the world's
  attention this way.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.390
Tensions now spiked in Syria.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.392
I remember he had the TV on

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:27.862
           and Egypt
    had just started brewing
     for a couple of days.

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:31.199
   And he was kind of pacing
         back and forth

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:34.235
 saying, "I think I should go,
   I'm gonna talk to my boss

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:37.538
      and try to get there
      'cause I think this
       is gonna be big."

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:41.943
        And sure enough,
  two days later, he was there

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.246
 and he was right, it was big.

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:02.297
Even while the government
   was insisting

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.599
 that journalists were welcome
   to report freely in Egypt,

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.567
    at the end of last week,
    we have now learned that

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.937
from the International Committee
    to Protect Journalists,

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:10.939
         26 journalists
       have been detained

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:13.107
  since the end of last week,
         since Friday.

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.410
 Seventy-one since the protests
        began and those

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:16.978
     are the just the ones
       they could count.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.015
I interviewed Chris
  for my book on Iraq

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:24.385
  and he talked in particular
    about the changing role
          of the media

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.256
          and he said,
  "You know, 10, 15 years ago,

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:31.426
the Western press was something
        that was courted
      and needed and today

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:34.062
         everybody has
   their own propaganda wing.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.130
      They're putting out
       their own message

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:39.968
    and a Western journalist
   who's there fact-checking
      is just in the way."

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.639
The number one
  fundamental change is

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:48.076
 if you had a media credential
   or it said media or press

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.678
        on your vehicle
     or on your flak jacket

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:55.650
   or whatever, you were safe
 unless there was an accident.

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:58.286
       You were not going
        to be targeted.

01:05:58.321 --> 01:06:01.155
     Now it's a completely
        different story.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.024
On the streets
  of Benghazi, Libya,

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:06.494
     a stronghold of forces
     opposing Libyan forces

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:09.163
    loyal to Muammar Gaddafi
  are defending their leader.

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:11.566
The city of Benghazi,
 now the heart of the uprising,

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:12.667
  is cut off to foreign media.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:16.604
  Libya is like a black hole,
    very hard to see inside.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.272
    We had crossed a border
         into a country

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.608
     that had been shut off
  from the world for 42 years

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:24.445
  and we were there illegally
 according to this government.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.648
This is not Cairo or Tunisia
 where you're photographing

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:31.319
     street demonstrations,
     this is deadly mortar,

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:34.222
 artillery, and war is no joke,
           you know.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.592
When I reached Libya,
 I knew it was going to bad.

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:42.630
  And it became bad very fast.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:47.068
         You never knew
       where the bad guys
     were gonna come from,

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:50.104
       when, how quickly
        things changed,

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:54.375
        how fast a town
     or a village or a city

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.078
       could change hands
   from being relatively safe

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.313
  to completely in the control

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:02.550
       of the other side
 and that's what I experienced

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:04.385
when I was captured in Ajdabiya.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.387
The New York Times says
 that four of its journalists

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.556
  covering the revolt in Libya
          are missing.

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:12.393
     One moment you're fine
    and the next you aren't.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:16.097
   And myself and some others
    from The New York Times

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:20.802
 were beaten and put in various
jails across the Libyan desert.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:26.641
     I did know that Tyler
       had been captured.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:31.379
 Didn't know what had happened
     to them at that point.

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:35.049
    We had heard there were
     refugees outside town

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:37.118
   where there had been a lot
   of fighting taking place.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.387
      So, we were wanting
     to do a story on them.

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.389
           You know,
    we were pretty cautious
       about making sure

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:44.092
    that the refugees story
        we were gonna do

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:47.562
     was something that we
        could safely do.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:50.731
    You sure this is behind
   the lines of the fighting?

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.767
    There's no question that
      we're gonna run into

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:56.304
       the Gaddafi forces
   and we're convinced that,

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:59.140
  you know, that it was safe.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.076
             And...

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:03.578
             we...

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:08.816
     ended up running right
       into the frontline

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:12.120
 of the Muammar Gaddafi, um...

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.224
             army.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.426
Still photographer
  Joe Raedle went

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:22.630
     missing Saturday while
covering the conflict in Libya.

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:25.765
     They were arrested at
  gunpoint by Gaddafi forces.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:31.439
They took us to a holding
 area which I think was like
  a 12-hour drive.

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:35.143
  The first thing you saw was,
as we were let out of our trucks

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:41.883
  was maybe 12 people standing
  with sacks over their heads.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.584
             Um...

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:48.122
  And then the Gaddafi people
   all had surgical masks on.

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:52.527
      So it was a pretty,
     uh, disturbing sight.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:55.630
 They made us pick up our gear
   and as we're going through

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:58.166
   these piles of, uh, gear,

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.502
           they had--
    The New York Times gear
       was in there, too.

01:09:02.537 --> 01:09:06.307
  I saw, I think Tyler's name
  on his bag or New York Times

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:10.243
    and, uh, so we knew that
  they had been where we were,

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.746
      we just didn't know
 if they had made it out alive

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.381
     or not at that point.

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:15.850
You were held
  for a total of what?

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:16.885
           Four days.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.156
      But, yeah, I'm good,
          made it out.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:23.390
      Other people didn't.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:29.663
My driver was killed
   in the process

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:34.169
    of when we were captured
 and it's hard to process that.

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:39.240
 Who's the one who has a bullet
       just fly past him

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:42.243
       and who's the one
  who gets hit by it and why?

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.279
They didn't kill us

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:50.251
    but, uh, they certainly
         put me through
   some psychological, uh...

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.520
          somersaults.

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:57.858
You know,
ended with them telling me that,

01:09:57.893 --> 01:10:00.261
   punching me and telling me
      that I was gonna...

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:11.739
     go home in a box, so,
   you know, that's something
   that's hard to deal with.

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:17.612
    We were able to get him
 released after a horrible time

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:24.585
        and Chris said,
    "Well, he can't come out
and not have someone greet him.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.521
He's gonna need a hug after this
   and he's gonna need a hug

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.690
    from one of his friends
        and colleagues.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:30.592
  So I'm gonna go out there."

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.527
          So he went.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.230
You know, it's
 like seeing your brother.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.933
       Things will be OK.

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.479
I think we try
  not to think about it

01:10:51.514 --> 01:10:54.615
      but we all know that
 that kind of thing can happen

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.485
    and that the very fabric
       of the profession

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.888
   is about risk and danger,
           so we try
 not to talk about it too much

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.357
  but I think when it happens,

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:06.294
   when any kind of calamity
      happens to a member

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:09.664
of the International Journalism
     Photography Community,

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:14.368
   everybody tries to step up
            and help
     and be there for them.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:17.838
When did you learn that Chris
 was gonna go into Libya?

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.608
 I knew somebody was going in,
      you know? So, uh...

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.645
    I mean, he replaced me.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.681
   We had a long conversation
          in my office

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.350
     with the two of them,
    with Chris and with Joe

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:33.854
   just in the room next door
        and it was like,

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:36.357
  "Surely this is a warning."

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:42.863
          And it was,
  "No, this is the big story."

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:46.434
He called me
 and he said, "Well, I decided
  to go to Libya."

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.672
        And in light of
       the conversations
    we had just been having,

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.842
I remember asking him, you know,

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:57.978
  "Why are you going to Libya?
      Come on." You know?

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:59.947
     "You were just talking
      about your wedding,

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.482
 why do you need to be there?"

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:05.353
   I remember saying to him,

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:10.524
     "I am tired of seeing
      AK-47s in the desert

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:13.061
 and if I've become numb to it,

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.832
        how many people
  have just become numb to it?

01:12:17.867 --> 01:12:20.702
  And it doesn't even register
an emotional response anymore."

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.072
       Couple weeks later
      I see the front page

01:12:25.107 --> 01:12:28.542
     of The Washington Post
  on my computer one morning.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:32.413
    And I typed on Facebook
     a little note to him,

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:36.550
   "Brother, that is the best
    damn picture of an AK-47

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.619
in the desert I have ever seen."

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:45.860
This is Chris Hondros.
 I'm in Libya at the moment.

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:51.966
  You can leave a message here
or email me at hondros@aol.com.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:59.607
I got a text from Chris
  that said "Libya?"

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:03.911
      That wasn't unusual
  because he was always trying

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:06.647
       to get me to come
   to Baghdad or Afghanistan

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:09.850
   or wherever the story was
   happening so that we could

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.419
     report together again.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.555
      I'd always said no.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:19.627
     And I had every excuse

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:22.663
 that I'd ever used in the past
         to use again,

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.169
   and the idea of not going
     never crossed my mind.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.608
We were in rebel-held territory
          in Benghazi

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:37.845
and, you know, it's pretty much
    the wild west out there.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:43.150
  Our days were spent driving
    from the relative safety
          of our hotel

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:45.653
        to the frontline
        of the conflict.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:48.522
        And it was about
       an hour and a half
       or two-hour drive.

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.491
    One of the great things
  about Chris was his ability

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:54.962
to sort of letting your attitude
          a little bit
     and lighten the mood.

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.897
       I remember one day
   we were driving in the car

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.767
      and we were heading
     towards God knows what

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:02.736
    up towards the frontline
 where people were being killed
            that day

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:06.507
        and Chris asked
     everybody in the car,

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:08.176
   "How do you order flowers
        for a wedding?"

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:11.846
     It was a reminder that
   there was this other life

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:15.015
     waiting for him after
   this assignment was over.

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.951
     And it was also a way
         for all of us

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:19.520
      to get our minds off
      of what was to come.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.458
         Allahu Akbar!

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:28.162
   To say this front is fluid
  is a serious understatement.

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:31.665
     Here we are yet again
    at the gates of Ajdabiya

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.101
      which has now become
 the frontal defensive position

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.904
of the rebels in eastern Libya.

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:42.209
These kids are just playing war.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:44.111
      Dangerous for them,
       dangerous for us.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.980
     If you think about it,
       this is just like,

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:47.515
  if you really strip it down,

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:49.583
   these are just bystanders,
           teenagers,

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:51.852
 they don't even have weapons,
    they don't even pretend
       they have weapons.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.488
   Essentially we're standing
  out here, if you look at it,

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:58.492
       clearly with three
     or four armed trucks.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.995
    We're standing out here
   with three or four trucks

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.963
 that actually have ammunition,

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:07.201
   so, versus the Libyan army
    who is fully mortarized,

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.604
      mechanized and armed
        down the street
    with who knows how much.

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.511
What I was hearing
  was that it was sort
  of amateur hour

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:20.614
   over there and there were
 all these young photographers

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.149
running around with cell phones
            and such

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.718
        and that really
     concerned me greatly.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:29.290
I knew Chris and Tim
 were traveling together

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:31.592
        which of course
    made me feel much better

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.894
    because one of the most
  dangerous things you can do

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:37.264
 is go into a combat situation
          with people
     who are inexperienced,

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.567
who don't have medical training,

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.302
       who maybe are not
    gonna hold it together.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.672
Allahu Akbar!

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:50.110
     There's all this young
   generation of journalists
     who were following him

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:53.547
  and they were following him
 in Cairo, you see the pictures
          on Facebook,

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:55.883
        he's surrounded
      by all these people.

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:58.752
  I don't know, it bothered me
 that he wasn't working alone.

01:15:58.787 --> 01:16:01.622
   Too many people around you
       is a distraction.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:03.857
         Photography is
     a solitary profession,
         it should be.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:04.559
   There's a reason for that.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:09.029
 And to be in tune and in touch
     with your own feelings

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:12.166
     and your surroundings
      and what's going on.

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:30.785
         -Allahu Akbar!
         -Allahu Akbar!

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:42.330
        Let's go, Chris.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.660
       Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.967
The more seasoned
  veteran photographers,

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:23.671
   they see a younger person
trying to get into this business

01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:25.706
   and they might be helpful
        here and there,

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:29.777
  but they won't actually try
        to like take you
        under their wing

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:32.346
       or care about you
     as much as Chris did.

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:36.417
   He really wanted to, like,
   make sure that the younger

01:17:36.452 --> 01:17:38.719
         photographers
      or journalists were,

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:41.855
   kind of, staying together
         and being safe

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.857
         and, you know,
       they felt in a way
       responsible for us

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:47.161
     and that was something
   I felt real gratitude for

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:50.764
        and also I felt
  like it was going to be OK.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:51.865
We should probably head out.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.300
Yeah, it sounded kinda hairy.

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.368
- What do you think?

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.213
No...

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:11.085
Chris was always
 recalibrating where he stood,

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.987
   walking around, you could
 just see the wheels spinning,

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.121
   he was constantly framing,

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.692
 you could see his eyes moving
     throughout the frame.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.796
     He didn't get rattled.

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:26.734
He was very aware of the things
      that could go wrong.

01:18:26.769 --> 01:18:28.769
       He was constantly
  performing mental calculus.

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:35.242
  And I saw how he had evolved
 and matured as a photographer,

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:36.877
 really at the top of his game

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.846
     those last couple days
      when were together.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:45.786
Yeah.

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:53.761
    We have about 45 minutes
        to make it safe.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.043
              OK.

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.846
        See ya, see ya.

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:14.815
Ooh!

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.485
    Outta here, no problem.

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:30.230
I last saw Chris
 on Wednesday April 13th

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.965
          in the lobby
   of the hotel in Benghazi.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:39.973
 Chris' last words to me were,
          "We got you
    out of here unscathed."

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:42.209
Even the other day with...

01:19:42.244 --> 01:19:45.012
I wish I would have
 held on to him a little longer

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:47.481
when we hugged and said goodbye
       for the last time.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.295
In Benghazi,
  there was a frontline.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.998
     It wasn't always clear
     because these weren't
     professional fighters,

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:09.136
     they would fall asleep
  on the frontline, they would
    run away during battles.

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.370
     Misrata was different.

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:12.239
      Misrata was a siege

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:17.044
     and we were going into
        be able to cover
the humanitarian crisis going on

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.045
    and arguably war crimes
      that were happening.

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:24.051
   So we got on a boat, a few
  journalists including Chris
     and Tim Hetherington.

01:20:24.086 --> 01:20:25.486
   It was a 17-hour journey.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:31.024
       We got to Misrata
and you're surrounded by water.

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.893
 Regime forces on another side

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:35.229
       and a battle zone
   in the center of the city.

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:38.098
   And there's nowhere to go
    unless you get on a boat

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:41.035
and get out, and even that port
  was under fire all the time.

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:50.244
    It was kind of difficult
 to find a place to stay there,

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:54.314
 so the rebels had like a house
  to host all the journalists.

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.216
     There were a lot of us
       basically sleeping

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:59.152
 on mattresses in various spots
    around the living room.

01:21:02.457 --> 01:21:06.860
So on the morning of the 20th,
 I remember Chris was there

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:09.963
          on the couch
  reading Pride and Prejudice

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:14.568
  or something really bizarre
 in this situation of conflict.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:17.170
 And, uh, I think I left first

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.873
 and then it was Chris and Tim
      and that whole group

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.309
       that decided to go
       to Tripoli Street.

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.278
One of the frontlines of Misrata

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:25.412
     was on Tripoli Street.

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.582
      And part of the road
         was opened up,

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:31.151
     so you could actually,
     you could drive there

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:34.455
         and you could
      sort of walk around
      and see the damage.

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:43.430
There was a large
  crowd of people,

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.999
       they were shooting
        in the building.

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.338
          Apparently,
     a few snipers inside.

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:56.443
And we'd have guys in the field
      with light artillery
   firing into the building.

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:58.345
   firing into the building.

01:22:13.395 --> 01:22:16.129
It was like a very dangerous
   place to be.

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:20.067
      One of the guys who
         was by my side
   just got shot on the head.

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:27.708
           Last one.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:43.991
          We're ready.

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:04.544
They tried to burn a tire
  to make them come out.

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.646
    They wouldn't come out.

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:11.318
        This oil is old.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:16.156
Someone, like,
 lit a fire in the stairwell

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.991
     and everybody started
  running out of the building

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:19.093
     because of the smoke.

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.503
  Hetherington was upstairs...

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:33.373
      stuck at some point

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:37.677
        and so basically
        had to climb out
 of the building on the ladder.

01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:42.015
The situation was very crazy
   for a while

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:47.421
and then it calmed down a little
      bit because I think
     they killed these guys

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.524
   so we decided to go back.

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:52.126
 Guillermo, you all right, man?

01:23:57.732 --> 01:24:01.101
We went back to the house
 so we could file our work.

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:08.208
       And at one point,
   the possibility of coming
         back up here,

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:12.579
    I don't know from where,
  and I said, "Yeah, why not?

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:16.049
       Some of the others
       were gonna go back
   and, at first I was, like,

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:19.052
  "No way, I'm not going back.
            No way."

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:21.188
           You know,
and Chris was not gonna go back.

01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:24.591
I remember
 it was kind of a division

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:28.395
        between people,
     of going back or not.

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:34.101
   And I think Mike and Chris
were not really into going back.

01:24:34.136 --> 01:24:39.372
There's been a lot of talk about
         what decisions
      went into that day.

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:42.476
 I don't think we'll ever have
      a 100% clear answer

01:24:42.511 --> 01:24:46.379
        about how things
       really went down,
          um, and why.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:48.849
    We don't have the luxury
    of being able to ask him

01:24:48.884 --> 01:24:51.518
     why exactly he decided
          to go back.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.799
So when we arrived
  in the afternoon,

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:08.168
  there wasn't much happening,
        it was strange.

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.804
  You couldn't hear shooting,
           you know.

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:13.673
  But you could feel tension.

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.642
We began walking by the building

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:17.844
 that we'd spent the morning in
            and then

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:22.182
      just maybe 100 feet
       past the building,

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:25.252
     a couple hundred feet,
         that's when...

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:28.555
        mortar came in.

01:25:42.404 --> 01:25:43.503
Thirty minutes after the hour,

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:45.672
   let's give you a check on
   the morning's top stories.

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:49.209
      The battle for Libya
     has claimed the lives
of two Western photojournalists,

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.577
         Chris Hondros
     and Tim Hetherington.

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:53.313
They were covering the fighting
         between rebels
       and Gaddafi forces

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:55.215
 on the frontlines in Misrata.

01:25:56.685 --> 01:25:58.685
American photographer
   Chris Hondros

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.289
   of the Getty Photo Agency
    died within a few hours

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.858
          of receiving
  a devastating brain injury.

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:07.394
   British-born photographer
  and Oscar-nominated director

01:26:07.429 --> 01:26:10.730
     Tim Hetherington died
  earlier in the same incident

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:13.233
   in the western Libyan city
          of Misrata.

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:16.703
Shrapnel from the explosion

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:20.373
          killed both
   British born Hetherington
     and American Hondros.

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:21.875
    Two others were injured.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:30.744
I have always...
    I have always  been very, very proud of him.

01:27:30.779 --> 01:27:37.317
     He had a dangerous job
     but we talked about it
          many times.

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:42.789
You see, that was his decision,
  it was his job, he loved it.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.994
   I'm still a little bit mad
       that he had to go,

01:27:48.029 --> 01:27:52.899
  but I always say he did more
       living in 41 years

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.369
         than some men
    that are 100 years old.

01:27:58.039 --> 01:28:01.808
You know I have been
   a photographer
 since I was 16 years old.

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:04.645
 I have no idea what I would do
     if I hadn't done this.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:09.482
Even though as war photographers

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:14.521
  you see so much devastation
and you see so much of humanity

01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:17.023
    at its worst, it's to me
   balanced by the fact that

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:19.326
     you also see humanity
       often at its best.

01:28:19.361 --> 01:28:22.495
         I've seen such
      examples of courage
       and such examples

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:26.800
     of human generosity in
   my work as well and to me

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:30.304
     that's been a balance
   to all the horrible things
        that I've seen.

01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:57.564
In 2003, I was just
  a photographer,
  still photographer,

01:28:57.599 --> 01:29:00.567
    and I actually wanted to
   become a photojournalist.

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:03.503
    Chris Hondros came here
       to tell our story

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:06.740
that brought that war to an end
       so I learn a lot.

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:08.842
       2005 he came back,
      we worked together.

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.879
     He give me this sight
         and I'm there.

01:29:14.616 --> 01:29:18.418
  I'm now a staff photographer
        for the European
       Pressphoto Agency.

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:25.358
   So I always imagining him
    with the angles I take,

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.494
         that's always
      coming into my head.

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:37.771
       I feel spiritually
      that Chris is in me.

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:42.476
I'm overwhelmed with his spirit.
