24:03.902 --> 24:06.738
Laura: LET'S GO EAT
THOSE JELLY SANDWICHES.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.824
OH, BOY.
THIS ONE'S YOURS.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.700
WHAT'S IN HERE?

24:14.621 --> 24:15.747
COOKIES!

24:15.914 --> 24:18.583
LOOK AT THIS.
CARRIE, YOU TAKE TWO.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.253
WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY,
THE MICE DO PLAY.

24:21.419 --> 24:22.879
ISN'T THAT
WHAT MOTHER SAID?

24:23.046 --> 24:24.422
YEAH. WHAT'S
IT MEAN?

24:24.589 --> 24:26.007
I DON'T KNOW.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.343
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, MARY?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.719
WHAT?

24:29.886 --> 24:32.055
NO, I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T.
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.557
Willie: WELL,
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

24:33.723 --> 24:35.267
SHUT UP.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.352
I'LL BET YOUR MOTHER KNOWS.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.354
WHAT'S SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

24:39.521 --> 24:41.565
NOTHING. JUST EAT
YOUR LUNCH.

24:41.731 --> 24:44.442
SOME FOLKS CALL IT
MONKEY BUSINESS.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.319
I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
IT'S WHEN A MONKEY GOES--

24:46.486 --> 24:47.737
Nellie: SHUT UP.

24:47.904 --> 24:51.408
I'LL BET EVEN MARY KNOWS
WHAT MONKEY BUSINESS IS.

24:51.575 --> 24:53.451
DON'T YOU, MARY?

24:53.618 --> 24:54.786
THINK HARD.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.788
MONKEY BUSINESS.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.790
MONKEY BUSINESS.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.417
MONKEY BUSINESS.

25:00.584 --> 25:02.335
MONKEY BUSINESS.

25:03.628 --> 25:07.507
MOTHER! SHE HIT ME!

25:07.674 --> 25:09.342
WHAT DID YOU
HIT HER FOR?

25:09.509 --> 25:10.760
NEVER MIND.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.387
WELL, IF YOU
DON'T TELL ME,
I'LL TELL MA,

25:12.554 --> 25:13.972
THEN YOU'LL
HAVE TO TELL HER.

25:14.139 --> 25:15.307
DON'T YOU DARE!

25:15.473 --> 25:16.808
I WILL IF YOU DON'T.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.643
YOU HAVE TO SWEAR
NOT TO SAY A WORD
ABOUT IT.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.647
CROSS MY HEART,
HOPE TO DIE, STICK
A NEEDLE IN MY EYE.

25:22.814 --> 25:25.609
IT'S THAT MRS. OLESON.
I CAN JUST HEAR HER.

25:25.775 --> 25:29.279
"IF YOU ASK ME, THERE'S
SOME MONKEY BUSINESS
GOING ON THERE."

25:29.446 --> 25:31.781
WELL, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

25:31.948 --> 25:33.325
I DON'T KNOW.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.368
THEN WHY'D
YOU HIT HER?

25:35.535 --> 25:37.204
BECAUSE
I FELT LIKE IT.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.413
OH.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.999
AND I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.355
[CRASH]

26:03.521 --> 26:04.773
YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:04.940 --> 26:06.358
Chris: YEAH.
I'M FINE.

26:06.524 --> 26:07.692
OH.

26:09.861 --> 26:11.363
Caroline:
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:11.529 --> 26:13.365
YEAH. I'M ALL RIGHT.
I JUST KNOCKED THE WIND
OUT OF MYSELF.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.699
NO. YOU'RE HURT.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.534
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.
DON'T BOTHER WITH IT.

26:16.701 --> 26:19.371
THAT'S NO SCRATCH.
NOW, YOU COME INSIDE
AND TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.456
IT'S NOT WORTH
FUSSING WITH. BESIDES,
IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.625
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION
TO WHAT I WAS DOING.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.168
PLEASE, MR. NELSON.

26:25.335 --> 26:27.212
I TOLD YOU. I ANSWER
EASIER TO CHRIS.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.548
ALL RIGHT!
DO AS I SAY, CHRIS!

26:32.592 --> 26:34.219
YES, MA'AM.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.556
YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU DIDN'T BREAK
YOUR NECK.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.601
OH.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.479
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
I WAS GOING TO GET
ALL THIS ATTENTION,

26:44.646 --> 26:46.564
I'D HAVE FALLEN
THE FIRST DAY.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.483
VERY FUNNY.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.532
YOU ALWAYS
WEAR YOUR HAIR
UP LIKE THAT?

26:55.699 --> 26:56.574
UH-HUH.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.243
LOOKED MIGHTY PRETTY
LAST NIGHT--

26:58.410 --> 26:59.911
DOWN AND SPILLING
OVER YOUR SHOULDERS.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.705
NOT THAT IT LOOKS
BAD NOW, MIND YOU.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.582
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M PARTIAL TO IT DOWN
AND...LOOSE, I GUESS.

27:04.749 --> 27:06.418
IT WOULDN'T BE
VERY PRACTICAL
WORKING AROUND HERE

27:06.584 --> 27:08.128
WITH IT LIKE THAT.

27:08.295 --> 27:11.381
IT MAY NOT BE VERY PRACTICAL,
BUT IT SURE WOULD BE
PRETTY TO LOOK AT.

27:11.548 --> 27:13.383
AHEM.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.636
DO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER SHIRT?

27:16.803 --> 27:18.930
THE ONE I WORE
TO CHURCH.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.891
I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO WASH AND MEND
THIS ONE FOR YOU,

27:22.058 --> 27:25.603
BUT YOU CAN WEAR
ONE OF CHARLES'.
YOU'RE ABOUT HIS SIZE.

27:25.770 --> 27:26.980
THERE'S NO CAUSE
TO DO THAT.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.315
Caroline: WHILE
I'M ABOUT IT,

27:28.481 --> 27:30.066
I MAY AS WELL DO
THE REST OF YOUR LAUNDRY.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.402
NOW, LOOK, I CAN DO MY
OWN MENDING AND MY OWN
LAUNDRY, ALL RIGHT?

27:32.569 --> 27:33.403
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:33.570 --> 27:34.904
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

27:38.616 --> 27:39.701
YES, MA'AM.

27:42.996 --> 27:47.709
AND FROM NOW ON,
KEEP YOUR MIND ON
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.712
YES, MA'AM.

28:06.436 --> 28:07.604
Laura: HI,
UNCLE CHRIS!

28:07.771 --> 28:10.148
HI!

28:10.315 --> 28:12.984
Laura: MY PA HAS
A SHIRT JUST LIKE THAT.
MARY MADE IT FOR HIM.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.320
THEN IT'S MARY
I'M OWING FOR
THE ONE ON MY BACK.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.155
WHY ARE YOU
WEARING IT?

28:17.322 --> 28:18.907
IT'S KIND OF
A LONG STORY,
BUT IF YOU'RE

28:19.074 --> 28:21.034
WILLING TO LISTEN
WHILE I WORK, I'D BE
GLAD TO TELL YOU.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.452
Laura: SURE.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.497
Caroline: HELLO, MARY.
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

28:25.663 --> 28:27.624
WHY IS HE WEARING
PA'S SHIRT?
WHAT?

28:27.791 --> 28:31.503
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
HE'S WEARING THE SHIRT
I MADE FOR PA!

28:31.669 --> 28:34.589
BECAUSE HE FELL
AND TORE HIS
AND GOT BLOOD ON IT.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.341
NOW, SUPPOSE
YOU TELL ME

28:36.508 --> 28:39.677
WHY YOU'RE USING
THAT TONE OF VOICE.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.596
I'M SORRY.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.140
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

28:44.307 --> 28:47.769
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED
TODAY TO PUT YOU
IN THIS MOOD?

28:48.895 --> 28:49.771
NOTHING.

28:49.938 --> 28:51.189
NOTHING?

28:51.356 --> 28:53.358
COME, NOW.
SOMETHING MUST
HAVE HAPPENED.

28:53.525 --> 28:54.359
Laura: HI, MA.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.903
Caroline: LAURA,
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.239
YOUR SISTER CAN'T
SEEM TO REMEMBER

28:59.406 --> 29:02.075
WHAT HAPPENED
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.747
WELL?

29:07.914 --> 29:11.376
I GOT INTO A FIGHT
TODAY, AND I DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL YOU.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.461
OK, WHO WAS IT
WITH?

29:13.628 --> 29:15.088
NELLIE.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.381
WHAT WAS IT
ABOUT?

29:16.548 --> 29:18.800
YOU SEE, NELLIE STEPPED
ON MARY'S SANDWICH,

29:18.967 --> 29:20.301
SO MARY PUSHED HER.

29:20.468 --> 29:21.594
I ASKED
YOUR SISTER.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.596
THAT ISN'T EXACTLY
THE WAY IT HAP--

29:23.763 --> 29:25.223
NO. YOU SEE, WHEN MARY
PUSHED NELLIE DOWN,

29:25.390 --> 29:27.642
SHE FELL RIGHT
ON HER BACKSIDE.

29:28.852 --> 29:31.396
I GUESS I WAS
IN A BAD MOOD.

29:31.563 --> 29:32.689
YOU GUESS?

29:34.274 --> 29:38.403
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.696
YES'M.

29:39.863 --> 29:42.365
ALL RIGHT,
GO DO YOUR CHORES.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.575
OK?

29:43.741 --> 29:44.826
OK.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.161
WHERE'S
YOUR SISTER?

29:46.327 --> 29:48.413
SHE'S OUTSIDE TALKING
TO UNCLE CHRIS.

30:49.432 --> 30:52.769
Charles: HYAH!
Laura: PA'S HOME!

30:52.936 --> 30:54.646
Mary: HI, PA!

30:59.984 --> 31:01.569
Laura: HI, PA.

31:02.820 --> 31:07.283
Caroline: OH, CHARLES,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

31:07.450 --> 31:09.786
Laura: OH, PA,
WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.120
Mary:
CAN YOU STAY?

31:11.287 --> 31:14.165
Charles:
WHOA! ONE AT A TIME.
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

31:14.332 --> 31:16.334
I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
AND SEE HOW THE HANDYMAN'S
COMING ALONG.

31:16.501 --> 31:17.335
HIS NAME IS
UNCLE CHRIS,

31:17.502 --> 31:19.254
AND HE MADE ME
A DANCING MAN.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.296
IS THAT RIGHT?

31:20.463 --> 31:21.339
HE'S A GOOD WORKMAN,
CHARLES.

31:21.506 --> 31:22.382
PA, HOW LONG
CAN YOU STAY?

31:22.549 --> 31:23.841
JUST HELLO
AND GOOD-BYE.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.135
GOT ANOTHER SHIPMENT
TO TAKE OUT
THIS AFTERNOON.

31:27.011 --> 31:29.681
HEY! LOOKIT HERE!

31:31.349 --> 31:32.642
YOU KNOW,
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

31:32.809 --> 31:34.811
BUT I THINK HE'S
A BETTER CARPENTER
THAN I AM.

31:34.978 --> 31:36.187
DO YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK, PA?

31:36.354 --> 31:37.480
YEAH. WE GOT A DEADLINE,
DARLING.

31:37.647 --> 31:38.898
WHERE IS HE?
I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.441
I DON'T KNOW.
CHRIS?

31:40.608 --> 31:42.360
CHRIS?

31:42.527 --> 31:44.362
HE WAS HERE
JUST A MINUTE AGO.

31:44.529 --> 31:46.364
MAYBE HE WENT UP
TO THE SODDY.

31:46.531 --> 31:48.575
LAURA, WILL YOU
RUN UP AND SEE?

31:48.741 --> 31:49.909
SURE, MA.
THANK YOU.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.369
THIS IS REALLY
GOOD WORK.

31:51.536 --> 31:52.662
CAN'T YOU STAY, PA?

31:52.829 --> 31:54.289
I WISH I COULD,
BUT BY ALL RIGHTS,

31:54.455 --> 31:55.665
I OUGHT TO BE
LOADING AT THE MILL
RIGHT NOW.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.041
CAN'T YOU EVEN
STAY FOR SUPPER?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.876
NO. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.295
I WOULDN'T MIND
TAKING SOMETHING BAKED
ALONG WITH ME, THOUGH.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.422
I MUST HAVE GUESSED.
HOW ABOUT RHUBARB PIE?

32:02.589 --> 32:04.299
MM-HMM! LOVE IT!

32:04.465 --> 32:06.551
COME ON, CARRIE.
I'LL WRAP IT FOR YOU.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.094
MAKE IT A BIG PIECE!
I WILL.

32:08.261 --> 32:10.513
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE NEW KITCHEN?

32:10.680 --> 32:12.890
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.059
HEY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

32:16.436 --> 32:19.731
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.
I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.151
NOW, LOOK,
I WANT TO STAY,
BUT I GOT TO WORK.

32:23.318 --> 32:25.570
LOOK, I'VE
BEEN GONE LONGER
THAN THIS BEFORE.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.155
I KNOW.

32:27.322 --> 32:30.199
I JUST WANT YOU TO STAY.
WE...WE MISS YOU SO MUCH.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.618
AND I MISS YOU,

32:31.784 --> 32:33.620
SO DON'T MAKE IT
ANY HARDER ON ME,
ALL RIGHT?

32:33.786 --> 32:35.330
COME ON.
GIVE ME A SMILE.

32:35.496 --> 32:36.873
BIG ONE, LIKE THIS.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.207
THAT'S IT.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.294
WELL, HERE YOU GO.

32:41.461 --> 32:42.837
AH, THANK YOU,
DARLING.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.672
AH! SMELLS GOOD,
AS USUAL.

32:44.839 --> 32:46.132
HE'S NOT THERE.

32:46.299 --> 32:48.259
OH, HE MUST HAVE HAD
TO GO INTO TOWN
FOR SOMETHING.

32:48.426 --> 32:50.928
I'LL HAVE TO MEET HIM
ON THE NEXT TRIP.
I GOT TO GO.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.306
YOU BE GOOD. KEEP SMILING.
ALL RIGHT, BYE, LOVEY.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.435
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHO
TOLD ME YOU HAD SOMEBODY
HELPING YOU OUT HERE.

32:57.602 --> 32:59.103
MRS. OLESON.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.648
RIGHT. SHE CAME
RUNNING OUT OF THE STORE
WHEN I RODE INTO TOWN.

33:01.814 --> 33:04.192
TOLD ME HE WAS
ABOUT MY AGE,
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY,

33:04.359 --> 33:06.611
AND YOU WERE
TREATING HIM JUST LIKE
ONE OF THE FAMILY.

33:06.778 --> 33:08.196
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

33:08.363 --> 33:10.657
I TOLD HER,
"THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR EASING MY MIND."

33:10.823 --> 33:13.117
OLD BIDDY THOUGHT
SHE WAS GOING TO
MAKE ME JEALOUS.

33:16.954 --> 33:18.665
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

33:20.458 --> 33:21.834
I...

33:22.001 --> 33:23.336
I JUST MISS YOU.

33:23.503 --> 33:26.923
I'M GETTING MISSED
AN AWFUL LOT
ON THIS TRIP.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.800
YOU'RE ALWAYS MISSED.

33:28.966 --> 33:30.343
I ALWAYS
MISS YOU.

33:30.510 --> 33:32.679
NOW I GOT TO
GO TO WORK.

33:36.516 --> 33:37.934
I'LL SEE YOU
SOON.

33:38.101 --> 33:39.477
Laura: BYE, PA!

33:39.644 --> 33:41.437
Mary: BYE, PA!

34:03.334 --> 34:06.713
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
GO ON BACK TO
YOUR CHORES.

34:13.511 --> 34:15.722
[HAMMERING]

34:25.440 --> 34:26.899
CHRIS?

34:27.066 --> 34:28.985
CHRIS,
WHERE WERE YOU?

34:29.152 --> 34:30.361
AROUND.

34:30.528 --> 34:32.864
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME
CALL YOU?

34:33.030 --> 34:34.824
CHARLES WANTED
TO MEET YOU...

34:34.991 --> 34:37.368
ESPECIALLY TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR FINE WORK.

34:37.535 --> 34:39.871
YEAH, WELL, I'M GLAD
HE WAS PLEASED.

34:40.037 --> 34:41.748
EXCUSE ME.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.294
WHY'D YOU STAY AWAY?
WHAT'S WRONG?

34:46.461 --> 34:50.047
I'VE BEEN AROUND FAMILIES
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN
AN OUTSIDER ISN'T WANTED.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.049
YOU'RE NOT
AN OUTSIDER!

34:52.216 --> 34:55.052
THIS IS NOT MY HOUSE
AND NOT MY FAMILY.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.277
Laura: DON'T WORRY.
WE GOT DIBS ON IT.

35:11.444 --> 35:13.529
COME ON.

35:13.696 --> 35:16.115
LET THE LITTLE ONES
GET ON FIRST.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.659
OH, BOY,
