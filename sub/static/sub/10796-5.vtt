00:00.360 --> 00:02.806
I'm pretty sure
that you referred to Spector by name.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.487
- Are you certain?
- If you did, he knows that we're on to him.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.042
I was due to see Mr Spector,
but...is he the target?

00:10.200 --> 00:13.170
- Hairdresser's booked to see Annie today.
- She's been cancelled too.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.563
But you let me come all the way in here
before turning me away,

00:16.720 --> 00:18.210
Aargh!

00:20.040 --> 00:21.724
- <i>We've a problem.</i>
- What?

00:21.880 --> 00:23.962
<i>We've a collapsed ceiling.</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:25.246
What is that?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.687
<i>A body has been found. A female.</i>

00:27.840 --> 00:30.571
- Where?
<i>- The Belfast Hills.</i>

00:30.720 --> 00:32.609
It's nether. It's not Rose.

00:32.759 --> 00:36.731
She's unidentified as yet.
Perhaps I can use her for 12 hours?

00:36.880 --> 00:38.928
<i>Do you know a detective called Tom Anderson?</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:40.445
Detective Sergeant, West Belfast.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.251
I thought he might make
a useful addition to our team?

00:43.400 --> 00:45.243
Nurture your envy, Katie.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.482
<i>Your anger. It's the way forward.</i>

00:47.640 --> 00:49.642
What is it you want me to do?

02:29.480 --> 02:31.767

No, ma'am.

<i>You'll find in front of you
a target profile on Peter Paul Spector.</i>

03:30.720 --> 03:35.282
There's no date and time, and the precise
wording of the arrest is yet to be formalised.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.765
I'll do that with the officer nominated
and briefed to make the arrest.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.482
I personally like the arresting officer
to be the first interviewing officer if possible.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.211
- Do you have someone in mind?
- I do.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.011
I've made some enquiries.
That seems like it might work.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.162
Good.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.883
So far we've found no official record
for Paul Spector further back

03:56.040 --> 03:58.168
than his marriage to Sally Ann Goodall.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.846
We're still waiting on
John Paul Spector's army records,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.324
but one thing we do now know
is that Paul Spector is not Jewish.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.528
His father was born John Paul Marshall.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.685
Marshall was adopted by the Spectors
who were indeed a Jewish couple.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.844
They devoted most of their lives
to adopting and fostering children

04:15.000 --> 04:18.163
regardless of their race, colour or creed.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.765
Thoroughly good people it seems.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.685
- Where was this?
- North London.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.922
Is John Paul Spector still alive, do we know?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.321
He's alive and in prison.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.923
- Where?
- Canada.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.807
- In prison for?
- Murder.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.285
- A female victim?
- Male.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.729
I'm not sure if you remember me. Jim Burns?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.247
Of course I remember you.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.446
I've followed your career with some interest.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.691
If I may, I'll get straight to the point.

05:46.400 --> 05:52.043
I want to know if you remember this boy
from your time at Gortnacul Orphanage?

05:53.160 --> 05:58.803
I believe he was there from the age of ten to 13,
from 1989 to 1992.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.611
Is this to do with the recent spate
of sexual murders?

06:02.600 --> 06:04.045
Why do you ask that?

06:04.200 --> 06:06.123
It must be something of pressing importance

06:06.280 --> 06:10.171
to bring the Assistant Chief Constable
all the way out here to see me.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.604
Is this your man?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.482
What can you tell me about him?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.602
He was a very pretty boy.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.002
I've been following the progress of the case,

06:53.160 --> 06:56.243
in the newspapers, on the news,
with considerable interest.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.130
All those poor murdered gins.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.129
There's a great deal of consternation
among the general public.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.011
- I'm well aware of that.
- I'd like to help.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.721
You can. By telling me
what you remember about that boy.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.566
Would you call me Father?

07:12.720 --> 07:16.122
You've been defrocked,
dismissed from the clerical state.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.725
You are no longer a priest.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.168
DO you know what is sung
at a priest's ordination?

07:21.840 --> 07:24.923
"You are a priest forever,
like Melchizedek of old."

07:25.080 --> 07:30.530
A priest acts on earth as an alter Christus -
that is as another Christ!

07:30.680 --> 07:35.129
I know one of your victims believed
that he was being touched by the hand of God

07:35.280 --> 07:38.124
while you were molesting him,
because that's what you told him.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.408
All of those boys were willing participants.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.042
Every one of them consented,
I never forced myself on anyone.

07:44.800 --> 07:50.364
They wanted to learn about sex,
explore their sexual identities.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.842
They enjoyed it.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.122
If they deny that now
it's because they can't face their real natures.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.760
A child's consent does not count.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.844
What you were doing had nothing
to do with exploring their sexuality

08:07.000 --> 08:10.049
and everything to do with misusing power
and abusing trust.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.725
I never hurt a boy physically.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.406
And that's a source of pride? ls it?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.285
Mm.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.728
Do you feel no shame? No guilt?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.120
Why should I?

08:21.280 --> 08:26.047
Shame...for who you are?
Guilt at what you've done?

08:26.200 --> 08:29.283
I was showing children love,
expressing affection,

08:29.440 --> 08:32.250
By performing oral sex on 12 year olds?

08:32.880 --> 08:36.009
How many of those boys
still have faith in the Catholic Church,

08:36.159 --> 08:38.003
still have faith in God, do you think?

08:38.159 --> 08:40.811
It's a disgrace
that I'm thought of as a common criminal

08:40.960 --> 08:43.850
and all the good work
I did over almost 30 years is forgotten.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.731
Even in this place I continue my vocation.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.202
A man dying on the floor of his cell
begged me for the last rites.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.727
What would you have me do?
Turn away from him?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.723
Refuse to confer absolution?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.606
I was obliged to dispense the sacraments

08:57.760 --> 09:01.401
because an indelible priestly character
remains on my soul.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.244
I absolved sin.

09:03.400 --> 09:08.281
One word from my lips transformed mere bread
and wine into divine flesh and blood.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.771
That power can never be taken away from me.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.167
This was a mistake. I shouldn't have come here.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.085
- Give me the photograph.
- You're an important man.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.764
You could lei it be known
that I will lead the community in sincere prayer

09:23.920 --> 09:26.002
for the apprehension of this individual.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.925
Say...say tomorrow at noon.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.246
Men, women, children -
it could be a mighty force.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.645
I'm sure there are plenty of priests
who could lead the community in prayer.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.090
Priests who aren't pederasts
sewing a 20-year prison sentence.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.323
I can perform any religious ritual
that is permitted to any lay person

09:50.480 --> 09:52.482
and no one can stop me.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.402
- Let me have the photograph.
- Father. Call me Father.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.164
No.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.411
Then I won't tell you what I know about this boy.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.121
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

10:16.280 --> 10:17.805
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen.</i>

10:18.040 --> 10:19.644
<i>I don't...I don't.“...</i>

10:19.800 --> 10:21.484
<i>I had an early night myself.</i>

10:21.640 --> 10:23.449
<i>It's a beautiful night.</i>

10:23.600 --> 10:24.761
<i>Beautiful night.</i>

10:24.920 --> 10:27.571
The first example
is the known recording of Spector's voice

10:27.720 --> 10:29.643
from his interview with DCI Brink.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.326
The second, the call from Rose Stagg's phone.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.045
<i>I don't think I can...</i>

10:35.200 --> 10:36.884
<i>I don't know what's gonna happen.</i>

10:37.040 --> 10:38.644
<i>I don't...</i>

10:38.800 --> 10:40.211
<i>I had an early night myself.</i>

10:40.360 --> 10:41.691
<i>It's a beautiful night.</i>

10:41.840 --> 10:43.842
<i>Beautiful night.</i>

10:44.360 --> 10:48.285
Normally, 20 or more different words
are needed for a meaningful comparison.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.889
Comparing two voice samples of less than
20 words results in a less conclusive opinion:

10:53.040 --> 10:55.691
possibly instead of probably.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.367
The call from Rose Stagg's phone
was very possibly made by Paul Spector.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.923
It has been four days since Rose went missing.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.163
Delaying the arrest in the hope
that the suspect leads us to her,

11:10.320 --> 11:14.530
runs a number of very clear and obvious risks.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.086
Risks that, I think, we have to take.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.091
<i>Hey, this is Katie.
I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

11:47.240 --> 11:48.844
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

11:50.160 --> 11:52.208
Hi, er...it's me. I'm outside.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.089
<i>Have you left already?</i>

11:54.240 --> 11:59.531
<i>I can't really wait, so...
I'll see you at school. Bye.</i>

12:52.840 --> 12:55.491
These are the thermal images
from last night, ma'am.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.927
The only heat signatures are livestock.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.761
- Is that all Goodall land?
- Yeah, there's the farmhouse.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.646
- What's that?
- That's your derelict building.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.451
Perhaps it's on the list, We'll take a look later.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.568
No sign of Rose Stagg's car?

13:13.720 --> 13:16.405
No, ma'am.
We'll extend the search further south today.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.040
We need to find that car, Jed.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.208
From 3. That's the Benedetto girl
into the bank on Waring Street.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.089
<i>I  no longer have.</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:47.323
From 3. That's the Benedetto girl
into the bank, Waring Street.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.450
3 no longer has, running loose.
5, can you cover?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.967
From 5. Entering the bank.

13:55.520 --> 13:59.844
Message from Control, ma'am. The Benedetto
girl has cut school. She's on the move.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.242
<i>From 5. I now have.</i>

14:11.240 --> 14:13.891
- Where is she?
- In a bank on Waring Street, ma'am.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.042
5 now has.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.281
<i>From 5. She 's making a cash withdrawal,
looks like a large amount.</i>

14:31.240 --> 14:33.242
<i>Walking briskly towards the river.</i>

14:34.440 --> 14:36.090
What's the word on Spector?

14:36.240 --> 14:38.288
Sitting fight, ma'am.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.881
<i>From 5. The Benedetto girl
is on the footbridge at Lagan Weir.</i>

towards Custom House Square.

15:42.160 --> 15:46.085
<i>From Xray 1. Stand by, stand by.

<i>From Xray 1. Target is wearing a back-pack.</i>

16:09.520 --> 16:14.481

Have eyes on target running loose Ulsterville
Avenue, approaching Lisburn Road.

16:24.280 --> 16:28.604
<i>Arrest strategy not yet in place.
Follow. Do not lose.</i>

16:29.000 --> 16:32.288
Target now crossing Lisburn Road.

From 4. The Benedetto girt has entered
the Bleecker Street Hotel on Bleecker Street.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.205
<i>Running loose.</i>

19:22.360 --> 19:26.490
From 4. The Benedetto gin has entered
the Bleecker Street Hotel. Running loose.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.882
- What's happening?
- We lost him.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.121
What?

19:53.280 --> 19:55.282
We think he's somewhere
in the Botanic Gardens.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.885
We have cars covering every exit.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.850
All available surveillance operatives
are in the Gardens on foot

20:00.000 --> 20:02.128
<i>From 4. I'm in the lobby
of the Bleecker Street Hotel.</i>

20:02.280 --> 20:05.329
<i>Room 12 is registered
in the name of Paul Spector.</i>

20:06.280 --> 20:09.841
Call in the uniforms.
Spector's room is a crime scene.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.364
It needs to be treated accordingly.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.410
Get down on your knees!

21:04.560 --> 21:06.562
This is my hotel! It's my hotel!

21:07.040 --> 21:09.042
Drop what you're holding!

21:13.520 --> 21:15.648
- On your feet.
- What?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.121
I can't walk the corridors of my own hotel?

21:25.800 --> 21:27.962
Police. Open the door!

21:33.640 --> 21:34.766
Police! Open up!

21:34.920 --> 21:36.922
Open the door!

21:47.320 --> 21:49.322
Police, open the door!

21:53.400 --> 21:56.290
- Katie. Calm down. You are under arrest.
- Get off!

21:56.840 --> 21:58.842
- Get off!
- Just stop moving!

22:17.600 --> 22:19.602
Get off!

22:25.600 --> 22:28.843
Alpha Papa 1-2 to Uniform.
We have the Benedetto girl.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.089
<i>We believe the girl
has attempted to destroy vital evidence.</i>

22:59.240 --> 23:01.447
<i>It might be necessary to conduct a strip search.</i>

23:01.600 --> 23:04.683
Assign Hagstrom responsibility for her care.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.367
We need to provide access
to an appropriate adult.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.329
And put her in a detention room,
not in a...not in a cell.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.807
<i>Understood.</i>

23:14.960 --> 23:16.405
Thanks.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.722
<i>From Bravo. No sign of target.</i>

23:21.080 --> 23:23.560
Spector's juvenile criminal record.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.685
- From the South?
- I went to see Father Jensen.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.286
The pederast
who ran the orphanage at Gortnacul

23:35.440 --> 23:36.930
where Spector was when he was a boy.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.605
He remembered him well.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.600
- Peter Baldwin?
- PB.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.645
Was he abused by Jensen?

23:45.800 --> 23:47.928
Jensen says not.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.448
At 13 he was moved to Ballyvale.
It's a home in Dundalk.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.561
It was there that it seems
his criminal behaviour began.

23:56.600 --> 24:02.767
breaking and entering.
Ignoring valuables, taking underwear.

24:04.360 --> 24:08.604
And he kept a journal too, it seems.
Voyeur's map of the town.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.808
Days of the week, times of the day and night.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.691
Places where women could be observed.

24:14.240 --> 24:17.403
Notes about their appearance, age, habits.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.241
- Prison changed Jensen?
- No.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.682
He's just as arrogant, just as narcissistic.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.727
- He's unrepentant.
<i>- From 7. No sign of target.</i>

24:31.880 --> 24:33.882
Oh, where the fuck is he?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.242
Will you look who it is?

25:56.920 --> 25:59.526
Stop that! Stop that!

26:03.280 --> 26:05.282
Move back. Go! Move!

26:06.840 --> 26:09.446
Get down on your knees.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.682
Get down on your knees.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.562
Get down on your knees!

26:25.480 --> 26:28.848
- Where's my wife?
- What?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.882
Liz? Where is she?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.802
I don't know, Jimmy.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.765
Tell me...or so help me
I'll blow your fucking brains out!

26:40.920 --> 26:43.605
I swear to you, Jimmy,
I don't know where she is.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.762
Find out.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.968
How?

26:49.120 --> 26:53.762
Make some calls. Now. Find out where she is.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.881
I don't have my phone.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.202
Make some calls.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.841
Gibson.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.924
<i>Responding to an emergency call, ma'am.
The back of Elmwood Mews.</i>

27:18.080 --> 27:19.127
Elmwood Mews?

27:19.280 --> 27:22.045
The person who phoned it in
described two men in bomber jackets, jeans

27:22.200 --> 27:23.725
and the third in dark running gear.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.360
It made me think of the CCTV footage
of Spector running.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.409
<i>- How far away are you?</i>
- Minutes.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.282
All right, stay on the line.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.809
It's just er... I need to follow up,
for my case notes.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.405
I really need to see her in person.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.571
Elizabeth Tyler.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.129
Paul Spector.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.765
She was in therapy
because of the death of her son.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.922
Not because of domestic abuse-.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.722
That therapy was interrupted.

27:55.960 --> 27:59.089
Obviously I'll treat any information
as confidential.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.002
She's asking her superior.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.610
- My knees are hurling. Can I get up?
- No, you fucking can't get up!

28:10.680 --> 28:12.682
It's lovely music.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.083
What?

28:16.240 --> 28:18.242
They got me on hold.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.843
- What's in your bag?
- What?

28:23.600 --> 28:27.286
Give me your bag. Give me it.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.760
<i>Dani? Dani?</i>

28:35.680 --> 28:37.125
- What the fuck!
- Put the gun down!

28:37.280 --> 28:38.805
Nobody move, nobody move!

28:38.960 --> 28:41.486
Keep your hands in the air.
Keep your hands where I can see them!

28:44.640 --> 28:46.210
Aargh!

28:52.920 --> 28:55.366
- Stay where you are. Don't move!
- Dani!

28:55.520 --> 28:58.126
- For fuck's sake!
<i>- Dani, can you hear me?</i>

28:58.280 --> 29:00.203
You OK?

29:00.360 --> 29:02.362
<i>Dani!</i>

29:04.480 --> 29:05.641
Er...

29:05.800 --> 29:08.041
Sorry, ma'am. We've had a contact.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.563
- Were you hit?
- Yeah.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.727
- One in the flak jacket.
- And Spector? Is it Spector?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.682
Yes, ma'am.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.121
One moment.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.487
The suspect has fled the scene
in a white City Clampers van.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.291
He's er...six foot two, dark jeans, dark jacket.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.330
He's bleeding from his face.
He's taken my partner's gun!

29:40.480 --> 29:42.482
Establish an outer cordon!

29:43.320 --> 29:45.243
<i>- Dani?</i>
- Sorry, ma'am.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.880
- Is Spector still there?
- Yes, ma'am.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.603
<i>Any injuries? Head injuries?</i>

29:51.120 --> 29:54.522
No, ma'am. He's er...
I think he's bleeding from...his nose.

29:54.680 --> 29:58.366
OK. Don't let them take him to the hospital, Dani.
Do you hear me?

29:58.520 --> 30:00.921
<i>Just keep him at the scene.</i>

30:01.920 --> 30:03.922
Yes, ma'am.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.360
I've told the custody sergeant at the
Serious Crime Suite that you're on your way.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.522
Can I help?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.202
Yes, you can.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.042
From Xray 1. Standby.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.409
That's the target's wife
arriving at the house in the Volvo.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.962
<i>Control. Target's wife arriving at house.
Xray 1, wait out.</i>

31:30.000 --> 31:33.083
That man was on his back,
more or less as he's lying now.

31:33.400 --> 31:38.201
Then he made a move, raised his gun-
That's when the male officer fired again.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.930
Two more shots.

31:46.360 --> 31:50.126
Now just bring the wrist up.
Don't let me push it forward.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.770
Don't let me push it back, Thank you.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.410
Just don't let me push...

32:01.160 --> 32:03.162
Burns.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.842
Understood. Yeah.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.402
Mr Spector.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.925
Thank you for your statements.
We have your number and address.

32:17.080 --> 32:20.004
We'll be in touch
if we need anything more from you.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.642
This is Paul Spector.
He's not worn any protective clothing.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.082
Sign him out.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.122
Paul Spector.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.082
Detective Sergeant Anderson.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.969
I'm arresting you for the unlawful imprisonment
of Rose Stagg.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.406
You do not have to say anything.

33:33.560 --> 33:36.291
But it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned

33:36.440 --> 33:38.602
something you later rely on in court.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.367
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?

34:11.199 --> 34:14.123
<i>Police officers!</i>

34:24.199 --> 34:26.487
- Sally Ann Spector?
- Yes?

34:26.639 --> 34:29.688
- DC Glen Martin, DC McNally.
- What's happened?

34:29.840 --> 34:34.208
Sally Ann Spector, I am arresting you
on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.283
- What?
- You do not have to say anything.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.806
But it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned,

34:38.960 --> 34:40.849
something you later rely on in court.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.480
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.367
Your mother's here to see you.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.323
I don't wanna see her.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.369
Katie, you are a juvenile.

36:18.520 --> 36:22.047
The law requires an appropriate adult
to be present during your custody.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.202
Not her.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.362
Not her.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.646
They came to the house and arrested me.

36:43.800 --> 36:47.122
And they've bought me to
The Down...Serious Crime Unit.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.009
<i>- Slow down, Sally.</i>
- I'm sorry.

36:49.160 --> 36:53.245
- Why have you been arrested?
- Perverting the course of justice.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.050
In what way?

36:55.200 --> 36:58.443
They suspect that I lied
when they asked me about Paul.

36:58.600 --> 37:02.571
<i>- What about Paul?</i>
- Where he was the night that girl died.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.722
<i>- What girl?</i>
- The one in the park.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.362
<i>Did you lie?</i>

37:10.000 --> 37:12.002
Yes.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.362
<i>- Is this your one phone call?</i>
- Yes.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.081
<i>Sally... I 'm not a criminal solicitor.</i>

37:22.120 --> 37:26.648
<i>I should contact a colleague.
It's important you don't incriminate yourself</i>

37:26.800 --> 37:30.885
I'm pregnant, Steve. Please help me.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.842
Please remove your top layer, sir.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.202
Shoes.

38:28.120 --> 38:32.489
Both the Benedetto girl and Spector
have mobile devices with video files on them.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.961
Should we prioritise Spector's?

38:35.120 --> 38:36.963
Yeah. Definitely.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.127
Downloading now, ma'am.

39:11.120 --> 39:14.442
I must advise you
this interview is being recorded.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.929
I am Detective Constable Glen Martin.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.560
Detective Constable
Gail McNally is also present.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.246
The suspect's name is Sally Ann Spector.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.961
Also present is the suspect's solicitor
Stephen Jennings.

39:27.840 --> 39:32.050
It is...2200 hours on Monday, May the 7th.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.566
This interview is taking place
in the Down Serious Crime Suite.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.927
I'd like each person here to identify themselves
on tape for voice identification purposes.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.969
DC Gail McNally.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.522
Steve Jennings, solicitor.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.722
Sally?

39:54.160 --> 39:56.401
Sally Ann Spector.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.208
Just to make it clear, Sally,

40:00.360 --> 40:05.082
<i>the offence you are being investigated for
is perverting the course of justice.</i>

40:05.960 --> 40:09.726
<i>What I am going to do is ask you
to give an account of the answers you gave me</i>

40:09.880 --> 40:13.930
<i>when I telephoned you
on Saturday the 21st of April,</i>

40:14.080 --> 40:17.846
<i>and asked you to give an account
of your husband Paul Spector's movements</i>

40:18.000 --> 40:20.128
<i>on a series of specific dates.</i>

40:20.720 --> 40:23.246
<i>I believe the account you gave me was false</i>

40:23.400 --> 40:26.449
<i>and amounted to an attempt
to pervert the course of justice.</i>

40:28.320 --> 40:30.527
<i>Do you understand?</i>

40:31.600 --> 40:33.602
<i>Yes.</i>

40:35.640 --> 40:39.042
<i>Tell me in your own words
how you came to give me that account.</i>

40:41.160 --> 40:42.889
<i>I lied.</i>

40:44.480 --> 40:46.482
<i>I lied to you.</i>

40:50.400 --> 40:54.325
Er.., He called me
before he went into the police station.

40:55.960 --> 40:59.089
He said the police
would probably come round to see me

40:59.240 --> 41:01.925
and ask me to confirm
what he was about to tell them.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.288
He asked me to lie
and say that I'd been with him that night.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.041
That we were at home together.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.128
What reason did he give, Sally?

41:18.120 --> 41:20.441
When he called he didn't give a reason.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.921
So you just did what he asked?

41:23.600 --> 41:24.931
Yes.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.089
Did he ever give a reason?

41:31.880 --> 41:35.407
Er...yes, when he came back from the station.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.402
Tell them, Sally.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.371
Paul worked on a suicide helpline,
as a volunteer.

41:57.240 --> 42:01.882
Every Friday night, all night,
and some other nights as well.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.167
Or at least that's where I thought he was.

42:08.800 --> 42:13.442
When he came back he told me that he hadn't
actually gone to work for the last three months.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.761
That he'd been having an affair.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.002
<i>Take your time.</i>

42:29.760 --> 42:34.641
<i>He was having an affair...with our baby-sitter.</i>

42:37.840 --> 42:39.410
<i>She was 15 at the time.</i>

42:41.120 --> 42:42.884
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

42:45.360 --> 42:49.729
He said that if I told the police
that he'd be put on the sex offenders list.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.888
That he'd go to prison.
That...I might even lose my job.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.881
Is that what all of this is about?

43:03.720 --> 43:06.803
You understand that you're under caution?

43:09.560 --> 43:16.967
I should also remind you...that you have a right
to free and independent legal advice.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.883
And that you can talk to a solicitor
on the telephone if you so wish.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.485
That light indicates
the interviews being monitored.

43:33.000 --> 43:39.281
You have been arrested because we believe
that on the night of Thursday, May the 3rd...

43:40.480 --> 43:43.370
...you abducted Rose Veronica Stagg
from her home.

43:45.520 --> 43:49.844
We also believe that you have
unlawfully imprisoned Rose Stagg.

43:51.400 --> 43:54.609
That you're holding her somewhere
against her will.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.170
You may know Rose Stagg better
as Rose McGill.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.247
Your wife has been arrested.

44:09.880 --> 44:12.087
Your home is being searched.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.641
Katie Benedetto has been arrested.

44:17.400 --> 44:20.609
The hotel room you were staying in
is being searched.

44:21.200 --> 44:26.684
Things could gel out of control
for you very quickly, Paul.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.924
<i>Are you sure you don't want to speak?</i>

44:36.200 --> 44:39.090
All the files have downloaded
from Spector's phone.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.402
There's some videos you should see.

44:46.320 --> 44:50.848
<i>My wrists are sore. Can you untie me, please?</i>

44:52.560 --> 44:56.451
<i>Peter? Can you unloosen these, please?</i>

45:02.040 --> 45:04.247
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

45:05.640 --> 45:07.642
<i>Can you untie me, please!</i>

45:09.000 --> 45:12.083
<i>Please. Please can you untie me?</i>

45:14.320 --> 45:16.243
<i>Please take me home.</i>

45:16.440 --> 45:18.124
<i>Please take me home.</i>

45:18.280 --> 45:20.123
<i>My babies will be missing me.</i>

45:21.160 --> 45:23.083
<i>They're only little, they're young.</i>

45:23.240 --> 45:26.323
<i>They need me, Peter. They need me, Peter.</i>

45:36.000 --> 45:37.490
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

45:39.880 --> 45:43.930
<i>You were right. I did go to the police.</i>

45:44.960 --> 45:46.485
<i>...go to the police.</i>

45:46.640 --> 45:51.043
<i>I never will again...if you untie me now.</i>

45:51.360 --> 45:53.647
<i>I won't tell anybody what's happened.</i>

45:54.200 --> 45:56.567
<i>Please, Peter.</i>

45:56.720 --> 45:59.007
<i>Please, Peter, would you talk to me?</i>

46:06.000 --> 46:08.162
<i>I miss what we had.</i>

46:08.320 --> 46:10.448
<i>Hm...I do.</i>

46:12.000 --> 46:14.002
<i>Tom...</i>

46:15.160 --> 46:17.401
<i>He's not like... you.</i>

46:17.560 --> 46:19.210
<i>You.</i>

46:19.360 --> 46:21.488
<i>No one's like you.</i>

46:23.520 --> 46:26.842
<i>Untie me and we can have what we had again.</i>

46:27.960 --> 46:30.167
<i>It can be better.</i>

46:30.760 --> 46:35.561
<i>I know it's wrong, but I'm...so turned on.</i>

46:37.400 --> 46:40.483
<i>Are you? Are you?</i>

46:43.200 --> 46:45.168
<i>Peter?</i>

46:47.680 --> 46:49.887
<i>You fucking disgust me!</i>

46:50.040 --> 46:52.168
<i>You fucking piece of shit!</i>

46:52.320 --> 46:53.924
<i>You fucking worm!</i>

46:54.080 --> 46:55.969
<i>I know it's you.</i>

46:56.240 --> 46:57.605
<i>You pervert.</i>

46:57.760 --> 47:00.764
<i>You fucking pervert!</i>

47:01.200 --> 47:04.010
<i>You dickless piece of shit.</i>

47:04.160 --> 47:07.289
<i>You're a monster. You're a monster.</i>

47:09.040 --> 47:12.362
<i>You're a monster. You're a fucking aberration!</i>

47:12.520 --> 47:14.204
<i>Fuck you! Fuck you!</i>

47:23.720 --> 47:26.610
<i>Peter, please take me home.</i>

47:41.440 --> 47:44.842
<i>You must have had a terrible childhood
to do this to me.</i>

47:45.560 --> 47:48.211
<i>I feel sorry for you.</i>

47:49.160 --> 47:50.810
<i>I really do.</i>

47:50.960 --> 47:52.883
<i>You must have had a terrible childhood.</i>

47:53.040 --> 47:54.644
<i>I feel sorry for you.</i>

48:00.400 --> 48:03.688
<i>I don't want to die here, Peter, please!</i>

48:17.680 --> 48:20.081
<i>You want to be noticed?</i>

48:21.520 --> 48:25.161
<i>You want to be paid attention to,
make your mark?</i>

48:27.080 --> 48:29.606
<i>Fine. Hurt me.</i>

48:29.760 --> 48:31.762
<i>Do whatever you want to me.</i>

48:32.520 --> 48:35.888
<i>Go ahead...do your worst.</i>

48:36.040 --> 48:41.365
<i>Nothing you can do will ever take away
how much I love my husband.</i>

48:41.960 --> 48:44.361
<i>How much I love my children.</i>

48:46.040 --> 48:49.169
<i>Nothing you can do
can make me devalue my life in any way.</i>

48:49.320 --> 48:50.970
<i>I will celebrate life.</i>

48:51.480 --> 48:56.850
<i>I love and I am loved,
and nothing that you can do can take that away.</i>

48:57.720 --> 49:00.485
<i>Do you know that? Do you know that!</i>

49:07.320 --> 49:09.607
<i>Why the fuck are you watching this?</i>

49:10.880 --> 49:12.848
<i>You sick shit.</i>

49:13.560 --> 49:15.562
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

49:44.760 --> 49:46.842
I think it's time for a special warning.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.526
See if we can't make it
that a court draws an adverse inference

49:49.680 --> 49:52.490
from Spector's refusal to answer questions.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.642
I'll pass it on.

50:17.720 --> 50:21.281
I want you to listen carefully
to what I'm about to say, Paul.

50:23.800 --> 50:26.531
I'm now going to ask you to account for a fact.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.722
The reason I'm asking you to do this...

50:33.000 --> 50:37.210
...is because I believe this fact
shows that you are responsible...

50:39.000 --> 50:44.723
...for the abduction and unlawful imprisonment
of Rose Stagg.

50:46.840 --> 50:50.367
<i>I must warn you that a record
is being made of this interview...</i>

50:51.400 --> 50:54.688
<i>...and may be given in evidence
if you 're brought to trial.</i>

50:57.000 --> 51:00.402
And that the court may draw proper inference
from your silence

51:00.560 --> 51:06.806
if you fail or refuse to account for the fact
about which you are being questioned.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.442
Do you understand?

51:24.920 --> 51:27.844
<i>I'm asking you to account for the presence,
on your phone -</i>

51:28.000 --> 51:31.163
<i>the phone found in your possession
at the time of your arrest -</i>

51:31.880 --> 51:37.569
<i>oi a number of video files
featuring the image oi Rose Stagg...</i>

51:38.520 --> 51:40.522
<i>and the sound of her voice.</i>

51:43.400 --> 51:45.050
<i>And images of you.</i>

51:47.000 --> 51:50.800
<i>What is your explanation
for those files being found on your phone?</i>

52:57.320 --> 52:58.685
Granny!

52:58.840 --> 53:01.525
<i>They've finished
questioning your daughter, Mrs Goodall</i>

53:01.680 --> 53:05.287
<i>- and they're keeping her in custody.</i>
- Will you be seeing her again tonight?

53:05.440 --> 53:09.684
<i>I won't, unfortunately
but I will see her first thing in the morning.</i>

53:10.040 --> 53:12.486
- Give her my love.
- Granny!

53:12.640 --> 53:15.291
<i>I will. You try not to worry.</i>

53:18.120 --> 53:20.805
<i>Granny, is that Daddy on the phone?</i>

53:35.000 --> 53:37.651
- Gibson.
<i>- It's Christine Larkin, ma'am.</i>

53:37.800 --> 53:40.371
- Yes?
<i>- Some new results from the FSNI.</i>

53:41.200 --> 53:42.486
Tell me.

53:42.640 --> 53:44.608
<i>They've managed to type mitochondrial DNA</i>

53:44.760 --> 53:48.924
<i>from the degraded blood sample found on
the scissors that ties them to the crime scene.</i>

53:49.400 --> 53:51.402
<i>It's Joe Brawley's blood.</i>

53:54.080 --> 53:57.163
He's entitled to eight hours uninterrupted rest,
ma'am.

53:58.080 --> 54:02.404
If we wake him,
I have to reset the clock and you lose two hours.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.602
Fetch the gaoler.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.722
Yes, ma'am?

54:32.840 --> 54:34.842
May I?

54:46.520 --> 54:48.602
There's something I'd like you to do.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.041
I'm DC Gail McNally.

55:13.200 --> 55:17.649
Paul Spector, I'm further arresting you
for the murder of Joseph Brawley

55:17.800 --> 55:20.280
and the attempted murder of Anne Brawley.

55:20.440 --> 55:21.885
You do not have to say anything.

55:22.040 --> 55:24.691
But it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned

55:24.840 --> 55:26.922
something you later rely on in court.

55:27.400 --> 55:30.609
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.002
Do you understand?
