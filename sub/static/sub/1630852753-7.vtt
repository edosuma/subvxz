WEBVTT

01:00.143 --> 01:03.981
Call me a waiter, because I'm 'bout
to put it all on the table, all right?

01:04.815 --> 01:07.109
Now, did I lie to Captain tonight?

01:07.192 --> 01:08.443
Yes, I did.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.487
Did I also lie to you?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.155
Also yes.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.032
But you are my booski wooski.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.367
You my everything.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.494
No, no. Don't you do that to me right now.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.080
I am this close to cracking it.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.249
You are gonna lose your badge.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.418
Okay, the system is messed up.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.837
-Okay, I'm lost. What's happening?
-That's why I'm doing this.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.173
Danner's not supposed to be on this case.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.049
-They're sending somebody else.
-That's crazy.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.427
That's good for you, right?
That means she can't arrest you.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.470
-I don't think that's how it works.
-I think it is, 'cause…

01:35.554 --> 01:36.972
-Hey.
-…she's not supposed to be here.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.557
Hey, Zoë.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.518
-How'd it go in there?
-What are you guys listening to?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.645
We're listening to Xavier's music.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.565
Kinda remembering-him-by-it kinda thing.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.569
Wait. Don't tell me
you actually like Xavier's music?

01:50.652 --> 01:51.987
-God, no.
-Oh, no.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.740
Have you heard the love ballads?
Have you heard "Pussy Hole"?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.783
-That's lovely.
-The title kinda turned me off.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.410
Have you ever heard his song "Orgasm"?

01:58.493 --> 01:59.578
No. How's that go?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.662
-How does it go?
-Yeah.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.249
Oh, no, another hit's coming

02:05.334 --> 02:07.252
Where'd it go?

02:07.336 --> 02:09.378
The man, he makes hits, right?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.341
About that mix CD…

02:12.424 --> 02:15.594
I should have given it to you.
Yeah, I didn't have the guts.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.012
I wish I'd known.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.599
You know,
maybe things would have been different.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.767
Maybe.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.853
Hey,
thanks for sticking up for me in there.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.813
-You know, that was really sweet.
-What?

02:26.897 --> 02:30.442
How would you know that
I stuck up for you?

02:30.526 --> 02:33.278
-Because--
-Because-- How did--

02:33.362 --> 02:34.947
-How did he hear?
-We were listening.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.615
How?

02:36.698 --> 02:39.034
When I came in there before,
I put my phone in there,

02:39.117 --> 02:41.411
and I called Yasper
so we're able to listen to everything.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.372
-Look at these.
-Oh, my God.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.832
-That's gutsy.
-I guess.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.627
So, they're talking right now,
and you can hear them in there?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.128
Do you wanna listen in?

02:50.212 --> 02:51.296
-Yeah. Could I?
-Yeah, okay.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.423
Yasper,
go and give Zoë your headphones now.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.926
I don't want to.
It's getting to, like, a good spot.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.555
Can you give her the headphones
so that Zoë and I can listen together?

02:59.638 --> 03:01.348
Maybe you should listen to mine.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.684
-What you think about that? That cool?
-He did it on his own.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.646
I believe this belongs in your earhole.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.856
Thank you.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.859
-You're afraid of my mouth germs?
-Your saliva.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.111
-That's where most of the germs live.
-Well…

03:14.194 --> 03:15.612
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.738
-I can't…
-Oh, my God.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.823
What are they saying?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.241
-They're still fighting.
-Can you give a sec?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.493
-I can't even hear from that side.
-Just one second, pal.

03:21.577 --> 03:24.288
Aldrin Germain? The "ringer"?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.707
-The detective they're bringing from LA?
-Yeah?

03:26.790 --> 03:27.875
I know him.

03:28.458 --> 03:32.296
So what? Everybody knows him.
He solved the La Brea Tar Pits murders.

03:32.379 --> 03:36.216
They're making a limited series out of it.
A-list cast. Clearly an awards play.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.509
No!

03:37.593 --> 03:39.761
I mean I know him.

03:39.845 --> 03:43.015
We were in police academy together,
down in LA.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.477
Before I learned how screwed-up it all is.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.770
What are you doing?

03:48.854 --> 03:50.230
I never thought I'd be a cop.

03:50.314 --> 03:51.523
Don't tell your story now.

03:51.607 --> 03:52.900
But my dad was a cop.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.943
His dad was a cop.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.238
But I was Daddy's little girl.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.241
And he didn't want me to be a cop.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.369
He said it wasn't a girl's job.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.083
And when my dad died, everything changed.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.961
And I decided I wanted to help people
the way my dad did.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.055
So I joined up.

04:24.223 --> 04:27.309
And my dad was right.
It's a real boys' club.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.521
-Right behind you. Right behind you.
-Okay. I know you're behind me.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.606
Okay. All right, let's go. Go, go, go.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.900
One way or another, I kept up just fine.

04:34.983 --> 04:38.070
Over. Under.

04:39.738 --> 04:40.906
Over.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.159
Under.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.744
Under.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.412
Under.

04:48.830 --> 04:53.460
Germain was the golden boy.
Fast, smart, a real climber. Literally.

04:59.591 --> 05:00.968
Dang it.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.804
Come on, Mad Dog.
You got this. Get up that wall.

05:03.887 --> 05:04.972
-Mad Dog?
-Come on.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.432
Okay.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.101
All right.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.062
Yeah. You all right?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.438
-Yeah, thanks.
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.148
-Thanks for having my back.
-Yeah.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.568
Well, you know, we all gotta finish
the whole thing under time,

05:17.651 --> 05:19.319
or else they make us run it again, so…

05:20.737 --> 05:21.738
Right.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.241
Listen. Three doors down you can get a--

05:24.324 --> 05:26.243
Hey, Danner. Nice form on those push-ups.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.079
Man, you dropped to your knees. I saw you.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.372
Night, gentlemen.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.583
Hey, come on. Come have a drink with us.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.919
-Really?
-Yeah, we need a designated driver.

05:36.003 --> 05:39.256
Damn, I forgot to put a car seat
in my car for you, Little Bill.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.382
Sorry.

05:41.717 --> 05:46.305
Honor. Ethics. Commitment.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.724
It wasn't easy, but I finally made it.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.643
And remember, what you did
yesterday is not nearly as important

05:51.727 --> 05:53.770
as what you will do today.

05:53.854 --> 05:58.609
Because the people out there
depend on you.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.152
Don't let them down.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.488
I was a part of something.
I was finally gonna help people.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.744
So, you say the package
was stolen from the front porch?

06:08.827 --> 06:10.370
Yeah, I ordered it online.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.247
It was a microwave egg pod cooker.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.000
Cooks eggs perfectly.
Does all the work for you.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.793
I have one myself.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.795
-When did this happen?
-Two days ago.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.590
We'll do everything
that we can to locate it.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.426
And I'm just telling you, honey,
when you get that in your life,

06:24.510 --> 06:27.846
it is going to step
your brunch game up times ten.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.098
Everybody's gonna be jealous of
your deviled eggs.

06:30.182 --> 06:33.060
Lady, let's be honest,
we're not gonna find your egg ball.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.104
-Pod cooker.
-Thank you, Danner.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.524
Look, packages get stolen.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.818
Unless we catch the guy in the act,
not really much we can do.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.820
-You know, it wasn't a guy.
-What's that?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.740
I know it was a girl.
I caught her with my new doorbell camera.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.200
Neat.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.451
Can I see?

06:50.536 --> 06:51.620
Is that green hair?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.622
Ma'am, do you think
we can get a copy of this video?

06:53.705 --> 06:56.250
I posted it online right away.
The whole world has it.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.337
I don't understand. Why didn't you
call us when it happened?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.005
I didn't think you'd do anything.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.508
But then I found out
I need a police report

07:04.591 --> 07:06.218
in order to get them to send me a new one.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.302
Right.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.848
187. 187. Viewridge Drive perimeter.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.851
Did she just say 187?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.270
Oh, yeah. Homicide.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.896
-Whoa.
-Holy shit.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.315
Well, listen, Viewridge Drive is
just the next street over.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.942
Okay. I'm sorry for the cursing.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.569
I don't give a fuck.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.112
Let's go. Come on. What are you doing?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.238
I'm coming.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.952
This much police presence,
must be somebody famous.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.912
But not that famous.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.164
Maybe a writer?

07:37.583 --> 07:40.002
Danner. Kleyes. Nah, nah.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.379
I need you to guard the perimeter.
No one in or out.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.173
We get gawkers, send 'em packing.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.924
Yes, sir, we're on it.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.050
But whose house is this?

07:47.134 --> 07:50.012
Pretty sure that's not information
you need to know to do your job.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.805
But let me guess, guy on the porch,

07:52.514 --> 07:54.391
okay, husband of the deceased?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.226
Perimeter. Now.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.937
Some fancy pants gets killed

07:59.021 --> 08:01.940
in the middle of the day
in a low-crime neighborhood.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.109
Nine times out of ten, it's a domestic.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.155
Husband comes home,
catches his wife cheating,

08:08.238 --> 08:09.948
gets nuts with a rake

08:10.032 --> 08:12.326
or a swimming pool thing
or something like that.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.205
But here, the husband isn't under arrest.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.248
Sitting on the porch crying.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.751
Doesn't add up.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.922
You say something?

08:26.632 --> 08:30.093
Why don't we split up
and really work the perimeter?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.136
Yeah, it's a good idea.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.431
Homicide.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.765
Yeah.

08:36.558 --> 08:40.187
This has to be the dumbest-- I don't know
why they partnered me with him.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.232
Tricia! Trish! Hey, girl.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.568
Heya, Danner. It's been a minute.

08:46.652 --> 08:47.653
Yeah, yeah.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.571
Yeah,
they let you out of the lab now, huh?

08:49.655 --> 08:51.907
So, what's the 411?
I hear it's not a domestic.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.117
No, husband's the one who found her.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.453
Wife's name is Uma something.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.080
Husband's Vaughn. He's a TV writer.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.248
I knew it.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.959
Whole thing happened at the front door.
They got it on the doorbell cam.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.378
Girl in a blue hoodie is
on the front porch stealing a package.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.840
Can't see her face, of course.
Wife opens the door, then bam.

09:07.923 --> 09:09.550
Blue hoodie? Did she have green hair?

09:09.633 --> 09:10.801
How'd you know that?

09:11.385 --> 09:12.719
Holy shit.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.807
All right, let's talk to the housekeeper,
see if she's seen that blue hoodie before.

09:17.349 --> 09:20.644
You know what, let's run down their
close contacts just for shits and gigs.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.271
-Detective Germain, sir?
-Jesus.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.606
-Sorry for interrupting.
-Yeah, what is it, Officer?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.025
Mad Dog Danner.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.987
Still on the beat I see.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.281
Definitely on the road to detective.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.032
Not as fast a road as you've been on.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.535
You just went "bloop."
Shot right up there.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.246
Yeah, you know what?
It's a closed crime scene, so…

09:39.329 --> 09:41.623
But I have some information
I think might be helpful to you.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.128
Okay, Mad Dog.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.589
Dazzle me.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.341
I've been working on some package thefts
going on in the neighborhood.

09:51.425 --> 09:57.306
And I have footage here of
a microwave egg pod cooker being stolen.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.141
They cook the eggs perfectly every time.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.186
That's from a doorbell cam at a house
about two blocks away from here.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.105
-Where did you get this?
-Online. The homeowner posted it.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.107
Blue hoodie. Green hair.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.817
Could be this person
that we're looking for.

10:08.901 --> 10:12.362
Well, I'm impressed, Danner. A lot of guys
around here don't really give a shit.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.697
Just wanna swagger around,

10:13.780 --> 10:16.450
as if a gun and a badge is gonna make up
for them having a tiny pecker.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.828
Look at you.
Conning your way onto a crime scene.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.956
Going the extra mile.
Mad dogging it. I like that.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.542
People depend on us,
and I don't wanna let 'em down.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.877
Besides, I don't have a pecker.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.670
Just gonna have to take your word for it.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.382
Check this out.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.094
-What? What?
-Think that might be your girl?

10:36.178 --> 10:38.680
Well, blue hoodie, green hair.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.850
Looks white to me. I mean, right to me.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.894
Well, who knows? Maybe we can get lucky

10:43.977 --> 10:46.522
and pull one of the license plate tags
from your video.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.357
Nice work, Danner.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.691
Pros will take it from here.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.528
Think I can get my phone back?

10:52.611 --> 10:54.738
Detective, I need my phone.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.032
Detective?

10:57.574 --> 11:00.327
You know I can't come in here
without the blue "foot-y" things.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.247
I need the blue bootee--
You ain't gonna put your bootees on?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.542
You not following protocol?
Well, then I won't follow protocol.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.419
Danner, what does
this have to do with this case tonight?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.380
-How is this relevant?
-This is so much tension.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.799
-It totally relates. Just let me finish.
-We don't have time.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.801
-This is important.
-What are they saying?

11:15.884 --> 11:17.094
Yas, we'll tell you.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.387
We'll tell you.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.055
-I'll be over here.
-Anyways…

11:21.682 --> 11:24.685
Why the hell are we in Echo Park?
This is way out of our area.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.522
I ran the partial license plate
on that car in the video.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.191
-Got an address.
-Didn't Germain say he'd handle it?

11:31.275 --> 11:33.110
I know. I wanna help out.

11:33.652 --> 11:34.987
Mad dogging it.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.240
Oh, shit.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.119
-That's hot. That's so hot.
-That's the car.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.787
That's the car right there.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.256
Hold on. There's latte on my gun.
There's latte.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.592
Have you ever shot that thing?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.052
Not in the field, no.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.388
But I did get pretty drunk
at my cousin's wedding

12:01.471 --> 12:04.725
and unloaded a clip into
a pile of decorative pillows.

12:04.808 --> 12:08.187
Needless to say,
the bride was not thrilled.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.522
Are you sure you're not from Florida, man?

12:10.606 --> 12:12.774
Arizona.
It's like the Florida of the West.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.116
Do it.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.203
LAPD.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.664
Is this your car, sir?

12:30.626 --> 12:31.960
Go, go, go!

12:33.670 --> 12:35.506
They're in an alley.
Headed towards the alley.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.299
Copy that. I'm in the car.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.593
Freeze! Slow down! You better stop.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.471
I could do this all day.
I used to run cross-country.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.183
Freeze! Freeze!

12:46.266 --> 12:49.311
-Drop your weapons and put your hands up.
-Against the fence. Hands in the air.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.396
The pot. I have a prescription.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.524
Girl, don't nobody give
no damn about no pot.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.484
-You have any weapons?
-No.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.444
Don't mess with me, pal.

12:57.528 --> 12:58.779
Whoa, partner.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.031
Come on now.
We just trying to talk to 'em.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.659
Men, right? They get the chasing,

13:03.742 --> 13:05.577
they start wanting to fight
like a grizzly bear.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.955
What are you doing walking around
with these marijuana bongs?

13:08.038 --> 13:10.249
-What's your name?
-Willow.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.835
Is that from the movie or the tree?

13:13.669 --> 13:16.797
Movie, actually.
My mom really liked it for some reason.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.715
Val Kilmer was fine as hell in that movie.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.384
What was his character's name?

13:20.968 --> 13:21.969
Madmartigan?

13:22.052 --> 13:24.179
Yes. And he helped Willow.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.265
Some people call me Mad Dog.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.517
And I'm here to help you.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.352
Put your hands down.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.231
"Valerie." Who's that? Your girlfriend?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.566
My mom.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.359
You two must be really close, huh?

13:37.442 --> 13:39.695
Well, actually, she passed last year.

13:39.778 --> 13:42.030
I'm sorry to hear that. It can be tough.

13:42.114 --> 13:45.492
So tell me,
what have you been doing in Studio City?

13:47.077 --> 13:50.789
Shit.
Look, my dad and I don't talk anymore.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.499
It's on me to pay
for my sister to go to school.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.585
She's, like, a genius or something.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.211
So I've been doing food deliveries.

13:56.295 --> 13:59.673
And, yeah, I did steal the package
off the porch a couple days ago,

13:59.756 --> 14:01.300
but it was just a dumb egg cooker.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.844
Wait. Hold up.
Did you call it dumb? It is not dumb.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.597
I just didn't think the cops would care.
It's a victimless crime.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.600
You know what isn't a victimless crime?

14:12.144 --> 14:13.520
Murder.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.397
Murder? What are you talking about?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.652
Look at her in there. Just pouting.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.821
Terrified.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.407
Like an adorable castoff
from an X-Men movie.

14:26.325 --> 14:27.910
It's a good get, Danner.

14:27.993 --> 14:28.994
Thanks.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.581
But I don't know. She says she
wasn't in Studio City yesterday.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.916
And I kinda believe her.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.793
We got her on camera.
This thing's a slam dunk.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.379
Yeah, but there's something
that's just not right about it.

14:39.463 --> 14:43.050
-Hey, you wanna help me question her?
-Really? You wanna add me to the case?

14:43.133 --> 14:44.510
No, this is still my case.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.471
But I just figured
I'd show you a thing or two,

14:47.554 --> 14:50.557
stuff they don't show you in training.
You wanna be a detective, right?

14:50.641 --> 14:52.476
Do Black women tie their hair up at night?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.647
You should know the answer to this.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.565
-And it is a yes.
-The answer is yes.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.234
Follow my lead.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.028
I didn't sell the pod cooker thing yet.
Can I just give it back?

15:03.111 --> 15:06.865
Look, I don't care about
some stolen packages, okay?

15:07.950 --> 15:09.284
What I do care about

15:09.368 --> 15:13.455
is the wife of the producer of one of
the best goddamn cop shows I've ever seen,

15:13.539 --> 15:18.126
whose only crime was opening the door
while you were stealing her package.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.963
-So you killed her.
-I didn't kill her.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.465
I don't know what you're talking about.
I swear.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.426
Then why did we find
your prints at the scene?

15:27.010 --> 15:29.096
No! No, no. That's impossible.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.557
No. There's pictures on Instagram.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.852
My boyfriend and I went to this
stupid art thing in Eagle Rock.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.021
It's nowhere near Studio City.
Check it, @willowywave.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.232
I don't like social media.
Brings out the worst in people.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.818
I like Facebook though.
Connects you to people from the past,

15:42.901 --> 15:44.611
who thought you might've been
a dork in high school.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.947
-Please!
-Found it.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.701
Yeah, that's a big old painting on a wall.

15:50.784 --> 15:54.288
And look at that. What is that?
A Pegasus or a unicorn?

15:54.371 --> 15:56.874
-Pegacorn.
-Okay, a pegacorn.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.545
But you know what is crazy is
she's wearing a red hoodie,

16:01.628 --> 16:02.629
not a blue one.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.965
See? I didn't do it.
I'm telling you the truth.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.093
What? You think there's some other
green-haired girl wearing a blue hoodie

16:08.177 --> 16:09.720
that just happened to be in the area?

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
Yeah, but it seems
kind of weird, you know.

16:11.889 --> 16:14.933
Like, driving all the way to Studio City,

16:15.017 --> 16:17.936
change your clothes, kill somebody,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.938
drive all the way back,
change your clothes--

16:20.022 --> 16:21.190
Mad Dog!

16:22.941 --> 16:24.443
-Stop.
-You all right?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.612
Why don't you go find us some coffees?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.906
Well, I already had some coffee,
like, a hour ago--

16:28.989 --> 16:30.532
Well, I would love one.

16:30.616 --> 16:31.742
Yes, sir.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.164
Look, I don't think
you meant to kill anybody, okay?

16:37.247 --> 16:40.542
You were high, feeling anxious,
she surprised you, you lashed out.

16:40.626 --> 16:43.378
If you admit that, this whole thing
will go a lot easier for ya.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.088
Danner?

16:45.172 --> 16:47.508
I was just wondering if you wanted
sugar or cream or…

16:47.591 --> 16:50.344
Full-fat goat milk. Dusting of cocoa.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.138
Damn, that sounds like
you want me to go to a coffee shop.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.682
I was talking about--
You said coffee, like…

16:57.267 --> 16:58.435
All right, then.

16:59.019 --> 17:02.314
Something was off.
And not just his foo-foo-ass coffee order.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.943
Fingerprints.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.086
I knew it.

17:24.169 --> 17:27.589
How you gonna leave fingerprints
when you're wearing gloves?

17:27.673 --> 17:29.925
But why wear gloves that time,

17:30.008 --> 17:31.677
and not the day before?

17:33.804 --> 17:35.305
Zoom in here.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.562
Kleyes, does this woman look
surprised or confused?

17:45.482 --> 17:46.733
Okay.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.611
Well, I think she looks confused

17:50.279 --> 17:52.739
like she might have recognized the killer.

17:53.699 --> 17:57.536
This might be a copycat.
Yep, let me look at this other video.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.581
It's probably a copycat.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.125
You talking to me?

18:04.501 --> 18:07.212
New Linkin Park. It freaking rips.

18:11.717 --> 18:14.428
While my partner focused on
his air-drumming skills,

18:14.511 --> 18:16.054
I went looking for answers.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.975
Sorry to bother you
during such a difficult time.

18:20.058 --> 18:23.604
No, it's quite all right.
There's always time for law enforcement.

18:23.687 --> 18:26.315
I'm a huge supporter of what you guys do.

18:26.398 --> 18:30.027
I'm sure you're aware
of my television show, Marshall Law?

18:30.110 --> 18:32.738
Yeah. Thursdays,
9:00 p.m. after Burden of Ruth.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.823
Terrible time slot. Comedies are at 9:00.

18:34.907 --> 18:36.742
Adventures at 10:00,
but they don't listen.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.912
Detective Germain said
that you've made an arrest?

18:39.995 --> 18:42.831
Yes, a suspect has been apprehended.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.334
That's such a relief.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.337
You can imagine this whole thing has been
very overwhelming for me.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.591
Hopefully, this will bring
a little closure, you know?

18:54.092 --> 18:57.888
I was just trying to, you know,
tie up some loose ends.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.225
I'm the type that likes to, like,
cross the t's, dot the i's.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.643
I even dot the j's--

19:02.726 --> 19:04.144
How can I help you?

19:05.270 --> 19:06.772
I was wondering,

19:06.855 --> 19:09.733
do you know if there was anyone
that had a grudge against your wife?

19:09.816 --> 19:12.027
I thought it was the package thief.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.906
-The woman with the green hair?
-Well, that's what everybody's thinking.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.076
I just want to be extra sure
it's not a copycat.

19:19.159 --> 19:23.080
Not someone who may have saw
the video uploaded to the Internet

19:23.163 --> 19:26.917
and thought, "Hey. I could do that."

19:27.000 --> 19:28.752
And pretend to be a package thief.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.754
Are you saying that
the case is still open?

19:30.838 --> 19:33.090
All cases are open
until there's a conviction.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.968
-Am I a suspect in my wife's murder?
-That is not exactly what I--

19:36.051 --> 19:38.053
I know how this thing goes.
I write Marshall Law.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.596
This is in pretty much every episode.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.766
I told him,
I was on set at the time of the murder.

19:42.850 --> 19:46.186
I was making my television show,
coaxing some actor out of his trailer,

19:46.270 --> 19:47.938
'cause he was complaining
about his call time.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.606
Well, my wife died, Gary.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.358
I was with you instead of at home!

19:51.441 --> 19:53.193
-I need you to bring it down.
-Hours later--

19:53.277 --> 19:56.488
-You're at ten. Need to be down at five.
-I will calm down. I discovered my wife…

19:56.572 --> 19:58.866
-No! No! No.
-…dead in the dining room.

19:58.949 --> 20:01.201
I'm not saying that
you are a suspect, okay?

20:01.285 --> 20:03.787
And here's why. The killer wore gloves.

20:03.871 --> 20:07.749
They didn't want their fingerprints
to be found anywhere, all right?

20:07.833 --> 20:10.002
You live here,
your fingerprints are everywhere.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.837
Why would you wear gloves?

20:13.088 --> 20:14.506
I just wanna know.

20:14.590 --> 20:18.552
Is there anyone
who would've wanted your wife gone?

20:21.555 --> 20:23.974
Hello? Vaughn?

20:25.559 --> 20:26.560
Hi.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.188
-Hey. Hey.
-I'm so sorry.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.647
Okay.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.233
Okay.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.278
-Is this a bad time?
-No, no. Please.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.114
This is Tatiana.
She's the costumer on Marshall Law.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.282
Nice dress.

20:40.365 --> 20:44.286
As well as Waikiki Medical
and Fire, most recently.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.038
This is Detective--

20:46.121 --> 20:48.081
Actually, I'm not a detective yet.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.583
I'm Officer Danner.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.210
But Detective Germain sent you?

20:51.293 --> 20:53.795
You know,
I ought to let you guys get to it.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.089
I just wanna say I'm sorry for your loss.

20:56.173 --> 20:57.341
Thank you so much.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.675
Yeah.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.475
-I really do like that dress.
-Thanks.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.478
Our rules say you can't touch me,
Bishop Marshall.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.314
Well, you should know by now

21:12.397 --> 21:14.358
that I play by my own rules.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.901
Get off me, puerco.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.611
No puerco for me.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.740
But if you wanna make a frittata,
you're gonna have to bust some huevos.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.286
The next day,
I visited the set of Marshall Law,

21:26.370 --> 21:28.497
the show that was
basically everything wrong

21:28.580 --> 21:30.666
with how TV portrays police and crime

21:30.749 --> 21:33.669
in a corny-ass 44-minute package.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.796
Cough up the details.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.923
Okay, okay. I'll talk.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.509
You better be telling me the truth, ese.

21:41.468 --> 21:44.304
Otherwise, I'm gonna alert my backup,

21:44.388 --> 21:46.515
and they're gonna give you
a piece of the action.

21:47.516 --> 21:48.559
Sorry.

21:48.642 --> 21:50.143
I'm not supposed to be here.

21:50.227 --> 21:52.062
I'm looking for Tatiana.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.315
And also, this is not
how law enforcement works at all.

21:55.399 --> 21:56.525
It's not like that.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.861
You're really not doing a good job.

21:58.944 --> 22:00.946
Is there a rewrite
somebody didn't tell me about?

22:01.029 --> 22:03.073
-Cut.
-Hey, what are you doing here?

22:03.156 --> 22:05.450
Could I get you over there
with the other background, please?

22:05.534 --> 22:06.535
I'm not a--

22:06.618 --> 22:08.954
-I'm actually looking for Tatiana--
-Tatiana. Got it.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.539
Your costume looks just fine.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.374
Well, this is not a costume.
This is my uniform.

22:12.457 --> 22:15.752
Uh-oh. Real cop. Let's go. Come on.
I love that. Love method acting.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.463
-Ma'am, can you remove your hand?
-Hey, I love extras. Let's go.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.549
Okay. Did you just tap my ass?

22:27.556 --> 22:29.141
Problem with your costume?

22:29.224 --> 22:32.436
No. Why does everybody think
I'm one of these actors?

22:32.519 --> 22:35.063
Wait. She's a real cop.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.440
Good to see you.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.775
Is this about Vaughn's wife? So sad.

22:38.859 --> 22:41.236
Well, I'm sorry
to be disturbing you guys at work,

22:41.320 --> 22:42.571
but I just wanted to know,

22:42.654 --> 22:45.240
where were you guys
around lunchtime on Tuesday?

22:45.324 --> 22:46.742
We all eat under the tent.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.493
Tuesday is chili day.

22:48.577 --> 22:49.620
Chili day?

22:50.329 --> 22:52.414
I bet it's interesting
in here after lunch.

22:52.497 --> 22:56.293
But Tatiana's a vegan,
so she always makes a salad.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.505
So you don't sit under the tent
with everyone else?

22:59.588 --> 23:02.132
No. I was. Giant salad, under the tent.

23:02.216 --> 23:05.052
Anyways, so you guys eat lunch together?
Every day?

23:05.135 --> 23:07.971
The whole crew? Even Vaughn?
Was Vaughn there too?

23:08.055 --> 23:11.391
No. Vaughn always takes a nap
in his trailer during lunch.

23:11.475 --> 23:14.144
Glad he got some rest, though.
'Cause a few hours later…

23:14.811 --> 23:16.897
Poor thing. Probably hasn't slept since.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.024
These are some nice hoodies here.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.443
Does he come in here often?

23:21.527 --> 23:23.946
No, we usually just show him pics.

23:24.029 --> 23:26.657
He did come in on Monday, remember?

23:26.740 --> 23:29.868
To borrow some stuff for a costume
for his nephew or something.

23:29.952 --> 23:31.954
-Oh, yeah.
-What did he take?

23:32.913 --> 23:34.915
Why? Is he a suspect?

23:35.499 --> 23:37.000
I'm just being thorough, that's all.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.044
You know what?
I will let you guys get back

23:39.127 --> 23:41.755
to reinforcing that cultural stereotypes
that y'all do.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.049
Okay. All right. Y'all have a good day.

23:44.132 --> 23:46.176
I love your hair.

23:46.260 --> 23:49.054
It kind of reminds me of Wendy's.
You know, from the burger place?

23:49.137 --> 23:51.098
-I get that all the time.
-Yeah, it's so cute.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.060
Hey.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.314
What the hell do you think you're doing
questioning the husband of the deceased?

23:59.398 --> 24:00.816
Showing initiative.

24:00.899 --> 24:03.443
-Mad dogging it.
-No. It's not fucking cute this time.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.988
Listen, we just announced
the arrest of the killer.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.197
The stoner punk chick.

24:07.281 --> 24:08.490
Willow?

24:08.574 --> 24:11.827
No, no. Look, I found something.
I think she's innocent.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.203
She is a thief.

24:13.287 --> 24:14.454
She is a drug user.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.874
She did it, end of story.

24:16.957 --> 24:19.960
She's willing to take a deal right now,
rather than risk the jail time.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.588
And you're gonna fuck up
my clearance record with this crap.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.214
Plus, Vaughn was super impressed with me

24:24.298 --> 24:25.799
and wants to make me
a consultant on the show.

24:25.883 --> 24:27.467
So don't mess it all up!

24:27.551 --> 24:29.094
But don't you wanna make sure

24:29.178 --> 24:31.305
that you got the right person
that you're putting in jail?

24:31.388 --> 24:33.557
I thought you wanted to be
a homicide detective.

24:34.266 --> 24:37.019
'Cause shit like this
is not gonna get you there.

24:37.895 --> 24:40.063
You're looking for a homicide detective?

24:40.147 --> 24:41.481
I don't know you.

24:42.191 --> 24:43.233
I don't-- Cool.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.069
You know why I call you Mad Dog?

24:48.030 --> 24:49.448
Because you need to be put down.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.871
Oh, man.

24:55.954 --> 24:57.372
"You need to be put down."

24:57.956 --> 25:00.584
-You need to shut the fuck up.
-Okay.

25:05.631 --> 25:09.218
Danner.
I hear you're not being a team player.

25:09.301 --> 25:12.387
What? No. No,
I'm just trying to do what's right.

25:12.471 --> 25:13.680
In this department,

25:14.389 --> 25:16.183
we need to have each other's backs.

25:21.522 --> 25:23.690
You think he was having an affair?

25:23.774 --> 25:26.401
Mama, there was a look
between him and that costume designer.

25:26.944 --> 25:29.029
I know that look.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.531
Why are you chasing this?

25:30.614 --> 25:32.449
What do you think
you're gonna get out of it?

25:32.533 --> 25:33.534
I don't know.

25:34.243 --> 25:37.496
But Germain thinks he is Bishop Marshall.

25:37.996 --> 25:40.457
Always right, you know.

25:40.541 --> 25:44.294
Breaking all the rules. Taking out punks.

25:44.378 --> 25:46.630
It's way more complicated than that.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.966
You've been an officer six years,

25:49.049 --> 25:51.051
and they haven't made you a detective yet.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.511
Maybe your dad was right.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.972
You could go back to teaching.

25:55.055 --> 25:57.224
Ma, I gotta go. Bye.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.813
This guy's not gonna crack.

26:04.523 --> 26:08.277
Chief, take a walk around the block.

26:10.571 --> 26:12.030
I'll get him to talk.

26:18.495 --> 26:19.913
He can't see you.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.498
He knows I'm here.

26:21.582 --> 26:23.959
This show sucks.

26:25.377 --> 26:26.920
I just couldn't let it go.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.132
Excuse me.
Are you Willow Landy's attorney?

26:30.215 --> 26:31.091
Can I help you?

26:31.175 --> 26:33.218
Yes. I have something
I'd like to talk to you about.

26:33.802 --> 26:34.803
Check out this video.

26:34.887 --> 26:36.889
So, I told him everything I knew.

26:36.972 --> 26:37.973
Wait, so you think--

26:38.056 --> 26:39.808
Vaughn saw the video,

26:39.892 --> 26:42.311
borrowed a costume from his set,

26:42.394 --> 26:46.607
then he probably added
some socks or something to his chest.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.526
Pretended he was the package thief.

26:49.610 --> 26:51.653
He hid his face from the camera,

26:52.279 --> 26:53.614
killed his wife

26:53.697 --> 26:55.699
because she found out about his affair.

26:55.782 --> 26:59.328
He wore the same costume,
but he added gloves.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.163
Not to hide fingerprints,

27:01.246 --> 27:04.625
but because he didn't have
a tattoo on the back of his hand.

27:04.708 --> 27:09.338
Now, see, Willow has "Valerie" in
that first video on the back of her hand.

27:09.421 --> 27:12.257
That's her mom's name. Valerie.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.761
Look, I'm sorry--

27:15.844 --> 27:19.932
I know it sounds crazy, but please
don't give up on this girl. Okay?

27:20.015 --> 27:21.975
Talk to some of his workers on his show.

27:22.059 --> 27:25.521
He borrowed a costume for his nephew.

27:25.604 --> 27:27.189
He don't have no nephews.

27:27.272 --> 27:30.859
He got one niece
that is pretty burly looking

27:30.943 --> 27:32.236
but not a nephew.

27:33.445 --> 27:34.613
Fine. I'll look into it.

27:35.113 --> 27:39.368
Thanks. But please don't tell anybody
you heard it from me.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.954
-I don't even know you.
-Great.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.416
He's totally gonna tell everyone.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.043
And he did.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.046
They reassigned me to the records room.

27:51.129 --> 27:53.006
No chance for advancement.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.970
Oopsie-daisy.
Thanks for being a team player, sport.

28:06.228 --> 28:07.938
But it was worth it

28:08.021 --> 28:09.898
because Willow's case was dismissed.

28:13.861 --> 28:16.113
Pink. I like it.

28:17.322 --> 28:19.074
My lawyer told me
you're the reason I got out.

28:19.157 --> 28:21.368
That guy cannot keep a secret.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.786
Yeah.

28:23.537 --> 28:25.372
No, seriously. Thank you.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.124
You're the only one who listened to me.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.377
Anyway, I want you to know I'm giving
the egg pod cooker back. I promise.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.879
Keep it.

28:31.962 --> 28:34.047
Mrs. Pattendole already got a new one.

28:34.131 --> 28:36.216
Besides, you deserve a good deviled egg.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.510
Cool. I've really never had one.

28:38.594 --> 28:40.387
-You never had a deviled egg?
-No.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.556
Girl, let me tell you something.
They are delicious.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.975
You get that deviled egg,
cut the boiled egg in half, right?

28:45.058 --> 28:46.935
-Okay.
-Then you scoop out the yellow part.

28:47.019 --> 28:50.439
You put that in a bowl, you stir that up,
and you add your seasonings and spices.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.483
You know, garlic, salt, a little paprika…

28:53.567 --> 28:57.112
You sprinkle that on top, and then
I like to get the oil of bell pepper.

28:57.196 --> 28:58.780
-Then you wanna put some olives--
-Danner!

28:58.864 --> 29:00.908
What happened to Vaughn?
Did he go to jail?

29:00.991 --> 29:02.784
No. Not enough evidence.

29:02.868 --> 29:06.330
I would have quit,
but I couldn't let that fucking game win,

29:06.413 --> 29:07.456
you know what I'm saying?

29:07.539 --> 29:10.334
So I moved up here for a fresh start.

29:10.417 --> 29:13.003
No more baggage, new department.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.338
-So I have--
-Okay, okay.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.715
So your point is what,
that Aniq is innocent?

29:17.925 --> 29:20.719
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

29:20.802 --> 29:22.012
But what I do know

29:22.095 --> 29:25.516
is if we don't solve this case
before Germain gets here,

29:25.599 --> 29:28.185
Aniq is going down
whether he did it or not.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.854
-Just like he tried to do with Willow.
-No.

29:30.938 --> 29:32.689
I actually think you've gone soft on Aniq

29:32.773 --> 29:35.442
because you think of him as
some sort of kindred spirit or whatever.

29:35.526 --> 29:38.028
-But he's been playing you the whole time.
-Maybe.

29:41.448 --> 29:45.327
I knew it. Your boy's been listening in
illegally without consent.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.162
He's been trying to hear
what everyone else said

29:47.246 --> 29:48.914
so he could get his alibi straight.

29:48.997 --> 29:52.543
One second. Hey, Aniq.
Yeah, it's Culp. Ya busted.

29:52.626 --> 29:53.627
Oh, no.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.587
-What? What, what?
-Oh, no. I'm screwed.

29:55.671 --> 29:56.713
What happened? What happened?

29:56.797 --> 29:58.048
-Aniq, hey. Look.
-I can't--

29:58.131 --> 30:00.676
-I still don't think you did it.
-Well, thank you very much.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.761
Maybe you can visit me when I'm in prison.

30:02.845 --> 30:04.805
Don't know if they'll let you bring
a little file--

30:04.888 --> 30:06.473
-Come on.
-You gotta tell me what happened.

30:06.557 --> 30:08.267
You can't just leave. Just like it's--

30:08.350 --> 30:09.977
Don't think like that, okay?

30:10.769 --> 30:12.896
Let's just breathe.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.314
You and Chelsea were on the stairs.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.567
You'd have seen someone go up before me.
It doesn't add up.

30:16.650 --> 30:19.778
Okay. Remember how you said that the thing
you like the most about escape rooms

30:19.862 --> 30:23.782
is that they make you feel lost
and hopeless and stuck?

30:23.866 --> 30:27.244
But eventually,
everyone finds their way through.

30:27.327 --> 30:28.537
You said that.

30:29.705 --> 30:30.789
So sweet.

30:35.085 --> 30:36.420
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:36.503 --> 30:37.880
Hey.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.885
You know, I've never seen a sunrise.

30:44.386 --> 30:45.387
The view.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.557
We're in the middle of some--

30:48.640 --> 30:49.641
Thank you.

30:52.394 --> 30:55.689
Okay. Aniq, I will admit,
has done some things

30:55.772 --> 30:58.942
that make him seem not innocent at all.

30:59.026 --> 31:00.485
-But--
-Danner, Danner.

31:00.569 --> 31:04.781
When you hear the clomping of hooves,
think horses, not zebras.

31:04.865 --> 31:06.658
Is this a riddle?
You know I'm good at riddles.

31:06.742 --> 31:08.827
Usually,
the simplest answer is the right one.

31:08.911 --> 31:10.662
And in this case, it's Aniq.

31:10.746 --> 31:13.707
But if you hear
the clomping of hooves in Tanzania,

31:13.790 --> 31:15.584
nine times out of ten, it's zebras.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.835
Oh, my God.

31:16.919 --> 31:19.922
-Your theories are so convoluted.
-Or they could be breaking out of the zoo.

31:20.005 --> 31:22.716
Did you see Madagascar with Chris Rock?
They had all them animals--

31:22.799 --> 31:26.178
You think the TV producer dressed up
as a woman

31:26.261 --> 31:28.597
and acted like a package thief
to kill his wife?

31:28.680 --> 31:30.974
To do that, he would have needed her
to open the door

31:31.058 --> 31:33.810
at the exact same moment
that he was about to steal the package.

31:33.894 --> 31:35.437
It doesn't make sense, honey.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.612
-It does make sense.
-What?

31:44.363 --> 31:46.532
-That's it!
-What's it? What?

31:46.615 --> 31:47.991
I know who killed Xavier!

31:48.075 --> 31:49.868
And how they did it.

31:49.952 --> 31:52.829
-I solved it, Culp. I solved it.
-What? Who?

31:52.913 --> 31:56.208
Okay, we just gotta tie up a few
loose ends like the wig and Jennifer 2.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.336
There are no time for loose ends, okay?
You either solved it, or you didn't.

31:59.419 --> 32:01.547
There's one person that I didn't interview

32:01.630 --> 32:03.841
that probably has the answers that I need.

32:03.924 --> 32:05.092
Mommy!

32:05.175 --> 32:07.344
-Maggie? What are you doing here?
-Twice in one night.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.929
Okay, I can explain everything.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.056
Hey, honey. Can you hum your quiet song?

32:11.139 --> 32:12.182
-Yeah.
-Okay.

32:12.266 --> 32:14.226
You fucking ball sack.

32:14.309 --> 32:19.857
You are a 6'3" turd in a leather jacket!
