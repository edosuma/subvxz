00:14.700 --> 00:17.090
All right, boys. Coast is clear.
Let's move.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.640
- Hey, guys.
- Jumbo shrimp.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.759
Doesn't a stealthy rendez-vous
mean anything to anyone anymore?

00:32.880 --> 00:35.030
A stealth... no.
Why? Should it?

00:39.180 --> 00:40.120
All clear.

00:40.550 --> 00:42.150
But stay on your toes.

00:43.730 --> 00:44.610
Right.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.730
Well, anyhoo,
guess what I found in my habitat, today.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.730
- It's... It's...
- An egg?

00:52.810 --> 00:56.230
And you are birds, so...

00:56.560 --> 00:58.340
So... What?

00:58.930 --> 01:01.970
Back at the aquarium,
the daddy penguins handled egg duty.

01:02.140 --> 01:05.680
Marlene, we are an elite force,
not nursemaids.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.980
Actually, Skipper,
incubation is a guy thing for penguins.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.350
It's natural instinct.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.180
You too, Kowalski?

01:13.650 --> 01:15.520
We can't give in to every gushy urge

01:15.690 --> 01:17.510
nature's burdened upon our species.

01:20.890 --> 01:23.050
Come on, you marshmallows.

01:23.670 --> 01:26.940
Think manly thoughts
like monster trucks.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.000
Isn't that just the...

01:36.370 --> 01:38.440
No... can do.

01:38.610 --> 01:41.220
We can't possibly
take this mommy mission.

01:41.350 --> 01:45.250
Of course you can't, silly penguin.
Because the egg is mine.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.550
Where did you...
I thought we had this area secure?

01:49.040 --> 01:50.790
You laid an egg?

01:51.140 --> 01:53.870
That's highly illogical
for a mammal unless...

01:54.190 --> 01:55.690
Are you part platypus?

01:55.810 --> 01:56.810
What did...

01:56.940 --> 01:59.650
You are a party puss, but I...

01:59.770 --> 02:01.470
I am king of things.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.680
Longly I have waited for the spirits

02:03.800 --> 02:05.840
to give me a proper heir
to my throne.

02:05.970 --> 02:07.870
That is why they sent me this egg.

02:08.150 --> 02:09.210
Sent you?

02:09.370 --> 02:10.840
Yes.
Indirectly.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.590
I shall call him Julien Jr.

02:13.970 --> 02:14.970
J.J.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.170
I will raise him to be just like me.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.180
Handsome, brilliant,

02:19.350 --> 02:21.450
and most of all, humble.

02:22.900 --> 02:23.880
We'll take him.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.830
Resume coochie-cooing, men.

02:30.980 --> 02:33.630
Well, we will see
who's coochie-cooing when I...

02:36.570 --> 02:39.370
I was muttering to me,
not you, silly penguins.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.640
Now carry on.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.730
We'll take shifts.

02:42.850 --> 02:46.010
The egg will have round the clock
supervision and training.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.820
- Training?
- That's right.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.310
By the time this rookie hatches,
he'll be ready.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.260
- But, sir?
- The clock is ticking.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.650
Commence operation:

02:53.820 --> 02:54.950
"Hard boil."

02:57.980 --> 02:58.910
Lovely.

02:59.030 --> 03:00.760
You're playing a game with Eggy.

03:01.860 --> 03:03.860
This is no game, Private.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.000
This tiny obstacle course
trains tiny soldiers.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.710
You'll get your little play time
when it's your shift, Private.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.290
Not bad.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.670
But you'll never make officer
with a time like that.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.480
Let's get in it to win it. Go.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.190
You've built a crib for Eggy.

03:40.310 --> 03:43.760
No, it's an intelligence intensifying
incubation chamber.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.840
From egg to egghead
in one giga-jolt.

03:48.810 --> 03:49.880
You can't...

03:55.910 --> 03:58.120
The sum of the square roots
of an isosceles triangle

03:58.250 --> 04:00.250
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.150
What just happened?

04:08.330 --> 04:10.510
Please, tell me
you're just flying a kite.

04:11.490 --> 04:12.940
Rico, where's Eggy?

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
Eggy can't fly.
Bring him down. Bring him down.

04:25.210 --> 04:26.280
You lost Eggy.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.780
Look at them
with the vomiting of my J.J.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.810
That is no way for a royal lemur egg
to be treated.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.710
He should be at my side.

04:42.990 --> 04:45.940
My left side, right about here.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.320
Me and my J.J,
with me he will stay-ay.

04:50.450 --> 04:54.210
And then we can play-ay
all night and all day-ay!

04:54.370 --> 04:57.680
From this lemur egg
my lemur prince will rise.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.350
Its little femur leg
growing to king size.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.110
He'll be regally,

05:03.280 --> 05:04.850
he'll be legally mine.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.180
Look at how cute he is.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.390
With me he will stay-ay.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.360
And then we can play-ay
from june until may-ay!

05:15.850 --> 05:17.400
He'll be regally,

05:17.530 --> 05:20.880
I said legally mine!

05:23.850 --> 05:25.770
Well, yes, J.J.

05:25.890 --> 05:29.270
- of course you can kick Mort.
- Your highness?

05:29.760 --> 05:32.180
No, no, he likes it.

05:32.340 --> 05:33.800
Your highness!

05:36.250 --> 05:38.810
You totally ruined my J.J. daydream.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.420
It had music and everything.

05:41.980 --> 05:44.210
Maybe you should let go.

05:44.340 --> 05:45.660
I'm no expert,

05:45.790 --> 05:49.160
but I suppose whatever's in that egg,
it ain't one of us.

05:49.630 --> 05:51.690
Really, Mr. Smarty Booty?

05:51.820 --> 05:55.030
And where J.J. will hatch from
if not from an egg?

05:55.150 --> 05:57.470
Mammals usually come from...

06:01.460 --> 06:04.000
Do not gross me out
with nonsense, Maurice.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.920
I think I am getting an idea.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.790
It is definitely an idea,

06:13.910 --> 06:15.810
and I have it. Me!

06:17.970 --> 06:19.860
You're in safe hands now, Eggy.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.630
Well, safe feet.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.800
What are you doing with the egg?
It's not your shift.

06:26.890 --> 06:29.710
Obstacle courses,
giga-jolts, hang gliding.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.860
You're all pushing too hard!

06:32.180 --> 06:34.370
You don't know everything, Skipper.

06:39.060 --> 06:43.010
- I'm sorry, it's just that I...
- Think you know what's best for it?

06:43.640 --> 06:47.420
But you're a boy yourself, a dreamer.
What could you know about raising it?

06:48.630 --> 06:50.550
I'll show you.
It's my shift.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.610
Everything's okay now.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.190
I'll never let anything bad
happen to you.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.440
I felt him kick,
and then he smiled at me.

07:13.880 --> 07:14.880
What?

07:17.960 --> 07:20.190
I'm an egg!

07:22.050 --> 07:23.420
Who is your daddy now?

07:23.590 --> 07:27.120
Not me,
because I am J.J.'s daddy and...

07:29.920 --> 07:31.130
My baby!

07:39.370 --> 07:41.240
Fooled me once, J.J.

07:42.740 --> 07:43.740
My eyes!

07:46.680 --> 07:48.600
Wait, was that just... no.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.580
A duck?

07:53.620 --> 07:55.150
A mother duck.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.720
- Keep looking, kids.
- Excuse me, are you missing...

07:58.890 --> 08:00.690
My egg.
Do you have my egg?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.470
Kind of... but no.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.660
But I sent it to the best eggy sitters.
Come on.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.330
Eggy's gone,

08:10.620 --> 08:14.320
and it's all my fault.
I am a bad daddy.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.040
No moping on duty, Private.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.540
- This is not over.
- Target spotted, sir.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.310
Let me see.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.440
What are you waiting for?

08:31.080 --> 08:32.750
A moment of silence

08:33.030 --> 08:34.900
to honor our fallen.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.750
Just think of monster trucking.

08:42.370 --> 08:43.429
Here, J.J.

08:44.270 --> 08:45.500
Come here, boy.

08:46.850 --> 08:48.210
He's alive!

09:01.820 --> 09:04.340
Quickly, men.
Operation "Stop pop".

09:18.610 --> 09:19.440
My J.J.!

09:27.090 --> 09:28.490
You're safe now.

09:28.740 --> 09:31.200
And you have little feet.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.420
Yes, you do!

09:34.170 --> 09:35.590
I demand custody.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.920
Look at all the danger
you have heaved upon my J.J.

09:39.090 --> 09:40.120
We heaved?

09:40.250 --> 09:41.700
You're the heaver, mister.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.960
Eggy was aces
until you pilfered him.

09:44.230 --> 09:47.460
But I pilfered J.J.
while he was on your watching.

09:47.590 --> 09:50.550
That makes you responsible
for my irresponsibility.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.540
I'll slap you
into the middle of next week.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.940
How dare you, sir?

09:54.110 --> 09:55.880
Quiet! Both of you.

09:56.270 --> 09:57.600
You're upsetting Eggy.

10:03.660 --> 10:05.710
- He thinks I'm his...
- Mama's here!

10:08.470 --> 10:10.890
See, I told you
they were natural born hatchers.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.280
Were you good for the sitters?

10:13.410 --> 10:15.690
The baby didn't give you boys trouble,
did he?

10:15.860 --> 10:17.430
Now that you mention it...

10:18.250 --> 10:19.300
Happy to serve.

10:27.990 --> 10:31.440
That's precious.
But time to get in line, kiddo.

10:34.310 --> 10:37.190
Monster trucks, men.
Monster trucks.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.380
Wait.

10:38.690 --> 10:41.550
Does she get to keep all the J.J.s?

10:42.700 --> 10:43.620
'Night, boys.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.650
You did good today, Private.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.970
It's just instinct, Skipper.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.730
Do you think Eggy will remember us?

10:54.910 --> 10:56.570
Cute and cuddly, boys.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.370
Cute and cuddly.
