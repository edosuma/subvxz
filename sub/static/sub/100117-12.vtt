WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.177
What happened?
Chuck:
Short version --

00:03.220 --> 00:05.831
Sammy lost hope,
and now I'm free.

00:05.875 --> 00:08.834
You go back to Earth 2
and play with your other toys.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.880
Because we will never give you
the ending that you want.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.142
We'll see.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.317
Kaia, look,
we need you.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.189
We need you
to dreamwalk for us.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.191
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.583
Get in the car.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.758
Get in the damn car!

00:26.113 --> 00:28.028
You know the thing
that killed Kaia

00:28.071 --> 00:29.072
in the Bad Place?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.508
Well, we think it's here.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.075
Why are you here?You know what we want.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.337
What'll you do for me?

00:33.381 --> 00:34.860
What do you want?I want to go back.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.601
-To the Bad Place?
-I call it home.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.689
To get back, I need help.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.777
We'll do what we can.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.170
The boy.
The special boy.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.867
The one that used Kaia
to open up the door?

00:41.911 --> 00:42.955
He can do it again,
for me.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.174
Yes, he can.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.349
If you don't
bring this back to me,

00:45.393 --> 00:47.743
I will find you
and kill you.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.875
Billie kept him hidden
in the Empty

00:49.919 --> 00:51.399
until Chuck
went off world.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.443
She let me out
when it was safe.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.705
To do
what I have to.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.403
If I do
exactly what she says,

00:55.446 --> 00:56.969
if I follow her plan,

00:57.013 --> 00:58.928
I'll be able
to kill God.

Jimmy Jack: You're listening to
Jimmy Jack and the Ros,

01:29.785 --> 01:32.396
traffic and weather together,
after the news.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.397
Take it, Ros.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.920
Ros:
Thanks, Jimmy Jack.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.922
Negotiations resume
at the U.N. today

01:36.966 --> 01:39.577
as world leaders work to
restore the Paris Agreement.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.406
The revamped agreement would
represent an historic victory

01:42.450 --> 01:43.625
in the fight against
climate change.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.670
Come again.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.455
In other news, President
Hillary Clinton is in Iowa,

01:47.498 --> 01:49.500
as she officially kicks off
her re-election campaign --

02:00.032 --> 02:02.513
Hello, sir!
Welcome to Radio Shed,

02:02.557 --> 02:05.951
"Where superstore inventory
meets swap-meet prices!"

02:05.995 --> 02:07.475
Oh, um...

02:07.518 --> 02:09.955
I take it
you're unsatisfied

02:09.999 --> 02:11.522
with your viewing experience
at home?

02:11.566 --> 02:14.612
You have no idea.
Okay.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.614
Well, we've got everything
the big-box stores have --

02:16.658 --> 02:20.966
4K, 8K, HD,
LED, OLED, HDMI 2.1,

02:21.010 --> 02:25.362
48-, 55-, and 65-inch,
freestanding or wall-mounted.

02:25.406 --> 02:28.278
And to bring it all together,
this universal remote --

02:28.322 --> 02:30.628
a Radio Shed exclusive.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.804
Sorry.
Not really what I'm looking for.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.503
Oh? Uh, then, what are
you looking for?

02:35.546 --> 02:36.852
An audience.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.984
An audience.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.030
It's monologue time.

02:45.339 --> 02:48.907
In the beginning,
it was just me and sis.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.213
Um...
And it was fine.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.562
But I wasn't satisfied.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.043
So I made more.

02:54.086 --> 02:58.221
I created the world.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.397
But I didn't stop there.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.485
No, no, no.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.183
I got the bug!

03:03.226 --> 03:05.402
So I -- I kept creating.

03:05.446 --> 03:10.407
I made...other worlds.

03:10.451 --> 03:14.933
Different combinations,
scenarios, characters.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.022
Different versions of
the same characters.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.461
You know, my --
"My other toys."

03:22.245 --> 03:25.205
Is that where I screwed up?

03:26.597 --> 03:28.120
Sir,
this is a Radio Shed.

03:28.164 --> 03:31.080
Dean says I'm not gonna get
the ending I want.

03:31.123 --> 03:34.257
And I don't know.
Maybe -- I --

03:34.301 --> 03:36.041
I mean, that shouldn't matter,
right?

03:36.085 --> 03:38.870
I've gotten what I want from
hundred of Sams and Deans.

03:38.914 --> 03:42.744
I could get what I want
from a hundred more.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.355
And I don't care.

03:45.399 --> 03:49.054
Those other toys, they don't --
they don't...

03:49.098 --> 03:51.448
spark joy.

03:51.492 --> 03:54.408
But Sam and Dean...

03:54.451 --> 03:57.367
the real Sam and Dean...

03:57.411 --> 04:01.284
they do.

04:01.328 --> 04:05.723
They challenge me...

04:05.767 --> 04:09.901
they disappoint me...

04:09.945 --> 04:13.035
they surprise me.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.825
They're...the ones.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.436
How 'bout a stereo?

04:22.479 --> 04:23.480
I don't need more!

04:23.524 --> 04:25.308
Okay.

04:25.352 --> 04:28.180
More things,
more distractions?

04:32.315 --> 04:35.927
I need less.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.281
It's time
to clear the board.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.414
All the other worlds,

04:44.458 --> 04:47.983
alternate realities,
the subplots...

04:48.026 --> 04:50.333
the failed spin-offs...

04:53.684 --> 04:55.686
It's time to start
canceling shows.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.356
Ugh.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.446
Oh, yikes.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.888
Oh. Hey, Alex.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.326
Alex:
Lasagna's getting cold.

05:26.369 --> 05:29.329
Yeah. Who made it --
you or Patience?

05:29.372 --> 05:32.506
I did.
It's vegan.

05:32.549 --> 05:35.857
You know, actually, tonight,
I'm grateful for that.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.815
I assumed we had a monster
on our hands,

05:37.859 --> 05:41.253
but it's looking like
human-on-animal cruelty.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.864
Poor Bessie was
clubbed to death.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.736
That's sick.
Yeah.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.086
Keep the lasagna
in the oven.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.132
Will do.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.191
Hello?

06:36.091 --> 06:37.179
Unh!

06:40.443 --> 06:43.098
I still don't like it.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.755
Which part --
Jack's deal with Death?

06:47.798 --> 06:49.931
Or the part where she's got him
eating angel hearts?

06:49.974 --> 06:52.150
Ugh.
The hearts were disturbing.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.065
So what's next?

06:54.109 --> 06:55.763
We're just supposed to
trust her?

06:55.806 --> 06:58.069
Well, apparently Billie's
got Jack on a need-to-know,

06:58.113 --> 07:00.463
which not a shock.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.422
We've made deals with
cosmic players before --

07:02.465 --> 07:04.075
"cards up"
ain't their style.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.078
Jack still doesn't
have a soul.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.907
And now he's been in the Empty
for months.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.910
I mean, we have no idea
where his head is right now.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.702
You rang?

08:05.746 --> 08:07.704
I don't understand.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.532
You made a silent prayer
to death.

08:09.576 --> 08:13.231
She's got her hands full
at the moment, so she sent me.

08:13.275 --> 08:16.408
What's up, kid?

08:16.452 --> 08:18.541
Well, I have my concerns,
but...

08:18.585 --> 08:21.675
Jack trusts Billie,
and I trust Jack.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.633
But what about cosmic balance,
Cass?

08:23.677 --> 08:26.027
I mean,
Jack's gonna kill God?

08:26.070 --> 08:27.550
What about Amara?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
I don't know.
I don't know.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.162
But I have seen
Billie's library,

08:31.206 --> 08:32.860
and I have
spent time with her.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.339
I...

08:34.383 --> 08:36.167
Well, "trust" is a strong word,
but...

08:36.211 --> 08:37.691
I believe in her.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.041
There's no one more committed
to the rules than she is.

08:40.084 --> 08:42.217
She's probably got it all
figured out.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.697
Probably?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.264
Like she had the Ma'lak box
figured out?

08:46.308 --> 08:48.005
Yeah, I dunno.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.572
I mean,
she's still Death.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.053
She was right
about Rowena.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.711
All I'm saying is,
I wish we knew more.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.234
Yeah, I got questions, too,

08:59.277 --> 09:02.193
but right now, this is
the only plan we got.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.631
Right.

09:06.633 --> 09:12.552
When the Grigori trapped me,
I called out for her, but...

09:12.595 --> 09:14.205
she didn't come then,
either.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.207
She musta known
you'd handle it.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.558
But...I didn't.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.603
Cass saved me.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.474
She musta known that, too.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.566
Relax.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.306
Just follow the rules.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.569
Lie low.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.614
Wait for instructions.

09:31.658 --> 09:35.879
And don't use your powers under
any circumstance, 'cause...?

09:35.923 --> 09:39.056
"If I do,
God might find me."

09:39.100 --> 09:40.275
Mm-hmm.

09:41.493 --> 09:44.584
Okay.
I'll do it.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.064
Everything she asks.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.197
Sam: Jack?

09:51.547 --> 09:53.418
Hey.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.333
Hey.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.813
Uh, who were you
talking to?

09:56.857 --> 09:58.815
Uh, no one.

09:58.859 --> 10:02.602
Hey, uh, I-I just, uh...

10:02.645 --> 10:04.081
wanted to check in on you,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.649
make sure
you're settling in okay.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.433
I am.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.652
Good.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.262
Good.

10:11.306 --> 10:15.310
We're all just, uh...

10:15.353 --> 10:17.617
We're just...

10:17.660 --> 10:20.141
We're so glad
to have you back.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.492
You know that, right?

10:23.535 --> 10:26.538
And --
And you know that...

10:26.582 --> 10:29.280
you could've come to us first,
Jack.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.283
We would've helped you.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.111
I know.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.301
I knew it, Dean.

10:50.345 --> 10:54.479
When I was with Jack's mother,
she...

10:54.523 --> 10:57.700
You know,
Kelly just had faith

10:57.744 --> 11:00.311
that Jack would be good for
the world, and I felt it, too.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.139
I knew it.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.663
And then,
when everything went wrong,

11:03.706 --> 11:06.404
and God took him from us,
I...

11:06.448 --> 11:08.493
I was lost in a way
I've never been before.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.800
Because I knew
the story wasn't over.

11:10.844 --> 11:13.324
I knew Jack wasn't done.

11:13.368 --> 11:14.804
And I was right.

11:14.848 --> 11:18.416
Well,
here's to being right.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.988
And here's to payback.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.164
Hmm?
Come on.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.384
What, revenge doesn't
sound good to you?

11:29.427 --> 11:33.431
What sounds good to me is
Jack fulfilling his destiny.

11:33.475 --> 11:37.697
Okay, yeah, but...
icing on the cake?

11:39.263 --> 11:41.831
I mean, Chuck wanted
Cain and Abel, and...

11:41.875 --> 11:43.877
now we're going
all biblical on him.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.531
Killed by
his own grandson.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.752
That sounds right to me.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.370
Heya, Jody.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.722
Jody: Dean,
I'm in trouble.

12:02.765 --> 12:03.853
Route 11.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.421
Fletcher farm,
the old barn.

12:06.464 --> 12:10.207
If you don't come,
I'm dead.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.038
Jody?

12:25.701 --> 12:28.791
She's gonna be fine.
Just hang tight, okay?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.488
Bye.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.293
Jody.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.687
Hey.

12:57.167 --> 12:58.255
You alright?
Uh-huh.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.256
Okay.

13:01.345 --> 13:02.956
Look out!

13:02.999 --> 13:04.696
Unh!

13:11.138 --> 13:13.096
You have something
that belongs to me.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.968
What, the spear?

13:15.011 --> 13:16.491
Oh, that got broke.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.841
You promised you'd get me
back to my world.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.278
Well, way I see it,

13:21.322 --> 13:23.846
that promise expired
the minute you hurt our friend.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.457
Aah!

13:32.159 --> 13:35.858
Alright, whatever this is,
it's over.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.817
You promised.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.819
You said
the boy could get me home.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.342
Well, the boy's
off-limits.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.865
Sam: I don't get it.
Why?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.998
Why go back to that Hellhole?
Why now?

13:45.041 --> 13:48.175
Because...

13:48.218 --> 13:50.830
my world is dying.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.180
Your world is dying?

13:53.223 --> 13:54.877
Yes.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.966
How do you know that?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.489
From my dreams.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.230
Who you got eyes on
over there?

14:00.274 --> 14:02.580
When you gave me the spear,
you said that there was someone,

14:02.624 --> 14:04.582
someone you were
protecting.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.584
Her.

14:06.628 --> 14:11.067
We share our memories,
our lives, our dreams.

14:11.111 --> 14:14.549
Even when I came here,
it never stopped.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.899
Kaia?

14:16.943 --> 14:20.337
We've been connected
my whole life.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.992
Born at the same time
in different worlds.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.212
Yeah, you killed her.
She's dead.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.170
I never meant to hurt...

14:27.214 --> 14:28.693
her.

14:28.737 --> 14:32.872
I thought I could
leave her behind, but...

14:32.915 --> 14:35.570
she haunts me.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.615
Kaia's alive.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.443
Oh, my God.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.706
What?

14:47.625 --> 14:50.890
She's been stuck over there
this whole time?

14:50.933 --> 14:54.371
We left her there
for dead!

14:54.415 --> 14:56.417
I left her the tools
she needed to survive.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.549
And she has.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.421
But...

15:00.464 --> 15:05.034
my world is ending,
and...

15:05.078 --> 15:07.080
I can see it
through her eyes.

15:07.123 --> 15:13.738
Miss Mack all dressed
in black, black, black,

15:13.782 --> 15:18.395
with silver buttons,
buttons, buttons

15:18.439 --> 15:23.923
all down her back, back, back.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.992
I need to
get back there.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.561
That's why I need your help.

16:16.149 --> 16:20.805
You have four of the same color
connected, so...

16:20.849 --> 16:24.287
Given the name of the game,
I assume that means you've won.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.988
They're back.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.646
Jody?

16:35.690 --> 16:38.171
Hey, Jack, Cass.

16:38.214 --> 16:41.217
Nice to finally
meet you in person.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.047
So, what happened?

16:45.091 --> 16:47.180
Long story.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.055
Hello, Jack.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.670
Jack can't help her.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.846
Yeah, we know that,
Cass.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.892
I already told her
he's off-limits.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.894
We'll find another way --
we have to.

17:05.937 --> 17:09.941
I mean, Kaia is there
because of us.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.161
Alright, so you and me,
we'll hit the lore.

17:12.205 --> 17:14.859
Yeah. Cass, why don't you
and Jody dig through our stores?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.035
We might have something
in inventory

17:16.078 --> 17:17.340
we haven't thought of yet,

17:17.384 --> 17:18.689
something that can help us
jump worlds.

17:18.733 --> 17:19.908
I'll call Sergei,
as well.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.692
He may have more
archangel grace.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.042
Other than Jack,
it's the only thing

17:23.085 --> 17:24.521
that's worked for us
before.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.524
-Yeah, good idea.
-We're running out of time.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.961
He's standing
right there.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.703
He could
bring us there now.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.489
Hey, Not Kaia --
not helping.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.709
I can help
in other ways.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.102
Research.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.625
Sure.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.410
Meantime, what are we
gonna do with her?

17:43.453 --> 17:47.979
Well, she killed a prize heifer
just to get my attention,

17:48.023 --> 17:51.896
then she jumped me, beat me up,
and threatened to kill me.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.290
Do I get a vote?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.927
Guys, what about this?

18:22.971 --> 18:25.016
La Piegatrice Mondiale.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.497
It's an old Italian spell --
Stregherian magic.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.934
It means
"The World Bender."

18:29.978 --> 18:31.022
What are
the ingredients?

18:31.066 --> 18:32.459
Basic stuff --
crystals, herbs,

18:32.502 --> 18:36.115
and the, uh...
"liver of a mandragora."

18:39.901 --> 18:41.511
What? What's that?
Some kind of monster?

18:41.555 --> 18:43.252
Yeah,
one that's extinct.

18:43.296 --> 18:46.125
Our dad wrote about it
in his journal.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.954
"A Hunt in Fargo" --
killed the last one.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.869
Hey,
why don't you go see if

18:51.913 --> 18:54.002
Cass and Jody
are having any luck?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.013
We're not
finding anything.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.493
I know.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.451
I mean, nothing that doesn't
require archangel grace,

19:08.495 --> 19:10.497
which we don't have.

19:10.540 --> 19:14.718
And Michael didn't exactly leave
a forwarding address.

19:14.762 --> 19:18.026
Listen, I can try
and jerry-rig up some magic

19:18.069 --> 19:19.506
using a substitute.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.638
But then again,
the only substitute we have

19:21.682 --> 19:23.640
that would even stand a chance
of working is...

19:23.684 --> 19:26.469
Nephilim grace.
Yeah.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.645
And I'm guessing that would be
against Billie's rules.

19:28.689 --> 19:29.994
So...

19:30.038 --> 19:32.867
We're batting zero.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.087
Castiel: Sergei?

19:36.131 --> 19:37.480
Hello?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.526
It's Castiel.
Call me back as soon as you can?

19:39.569 --> 19:40.918
I-I have a question for you.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.490
No luck
with your friend?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.884
Well,
Sergei is hardly a friend.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.320
But, no,
he's not picking up.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.235
You find anything?

19:53.279 --> 19:55.498
Uh, well,
there's a handful

19:55.542 --> 19:57.761
of unidentified objects
in the inventory,

19:57.805 --> 20:00.024
but the thing
about magical items

20:00.068 --> 20:03.332
is that they are
not on the web.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.509
We could go analog,
check all the books,

20:06.553 --> 20:09.208
but that could take months.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.514
You tell Claire?

20:11.558 --> 20:15.605
She's out of cell range.
She's deep in Yosemite.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.128
Believe it or not,
she's following up

20:17.172 --> 20:20.741
a lead on a woman
in a dark cloak.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.222
Apparently,
a false lead.

20:28.314 --> 20:33.362
Claire has spent years
looking for...

20:33.406 --> 20:36.539
revenge.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.107
She loved her --

20:39.150 --> 20:41.892
Kaia.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.547
Claire'd do anything for
a chance to save her,

20:44.591 --> 20:46.810
but there's just --
there's no time to loop her in,

20:46.854 --> 20:49.944
and if we fail...

20:49.987 --> 20:52.599
She'd never recover.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.731
It'd kill her.

21:03.131 --> 21:07.178
Sergei, you better not
be ignoring my calls.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.963
Call me back.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.409
Hello.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.585
What do you want?

21:22.629 --> 21:27.024
I'm sorry.
It's just...

21:27.068 --> 21:29.462
you look just like her.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.464
And...

21:31.507 --> 21:33.596
H-How did you come --

21:33.640 --> 21:35.946
I don't know.

21:35.990 --> 21:39.472
You have anything else you want
to say, "Off-limits" boy?

21:42.649 --> 21:44.128
I'm sorry I can't do more.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.130
I saw you.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.611
You encouraged her.

21:48.655 --> 21:52.049
She was scared, and you
pushed her to cross over.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.835
I...

21:54.878 --> 21:57.446
I wanted to help her.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.970
She was in
so much pain.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.190
She's in pain now.

22:02.233 --> 22:06.716
And soon,
she will die.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.371
Because of me.

22:19.425 --> 22:23.385
Why?

22:23.429 --> 22:24.647
Why did you do it?

22:24.691 --> 22:27.346
Come here?

22:29.739 --> 22:33.221
I envied her.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.745
Her world
looked peaceful.

22:39.793 --> 22:43.362
This place is...

22:43.405 --> 22:46.756
cold.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.411
I don't understand it.

22:49.455 --> 22:52.240
I don't know how
to move through it.

22:52.283 --> 22:55.417
So I just find empty spaces,
and I hide.

22:59.769 --> 23:02.206
This world
doesn't want me.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.951
And I'm done with it.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.089
You can fix this.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.701
You can help us.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.530
Please?

23:21.574 --> 23:24.054
Please?

23:49.776 --> 23:54.345
Miss Mary Mack,
Mack, Mack,

23:54.389 --> 23:57.610
all dressed in
black, black, black...

24:10.231 --> 24:11.624
I'm saving Kaia.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.929
What?
I owe it to her.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.149
She's running out of time --
I saw it.

24:15.192 --> 24:18.108
What, you --
How?

24:18.152 --> 24:19.849
Now, wait a second.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.285
Did you dreamwalk?

24:21.329 --> 24:22.504
Whoa. Hey. What?

24:22.548 --> 24:23.810
Jack, what about
Billie's plan?

24:23.853 --> 24:25.507
I know, I know, but...

24:25.551 --> 24:27.291
saving Kaia,
it's the right thing to do.

24:27.335 --> 24:30.860
You've got to
be kidding me.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.122
Who the Hell are you?

24:32.166 --> 24:33.515
Name's Merle.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.039
She's a reaper --
works with Billie.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.867
How did you
get in here?

24:37.911 --> 24:39.782
Piggybacked
on the boy.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.044
She's been watching me.

24:41.088 --> 24:44.483
Yeah, I've been watching
you screw up.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.310
One measly life
on the line,

24:46.354 --> 24:49.009
and you're ready
to risk it all?

24:49.052 --> 24:50.793
That's not just dumb.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.621
That's Winchester dumb.

24:52.665 --> 24:53.666
Hey!

24:53.709 --> 24:55.624
I'm the only one
who can do this.

24:55.668 --> 25:00.020
Well, try,
and I'll tell Death.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.332
Okay.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.857
Mm.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.430
Go.

25:19.474 --> 25:22.999
In the meantime, I'll open
a rift to the Bad Place.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.175
I'm sure Billie will
appreciate hearing about it

25:25.219 --> 25:27.395
after the fact
when it's already too late.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.179
Okay.

25:29.223 --> 25:32.705
And how about
I just stop you?

25:32.748 --> 25:34.663
Right now.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.535
You can try.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.450
Run to Billie.

25:39.494 --> 25:42.453
Tell her everything went
sideways on your watch,

25:42.497 --> 25:44.368
and see how she reacts --

25:44.412 --> 25:47.720
what she decides
to do to you.

25:50.244 --> 25:52.681
Or help us.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.858
Help us find the safest,
smartest way to pull this off,

25:55.902 --> 25:58.382
and she never has to know.

26:02.169 --> 26:06.956
Now...
this is Winchester stupid.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.958
But?

26:09.002 --> 26:13.223
But there might
be a way.

26:13.267 --> 26:20.056
The, uh...cosmic warding that
Amara peeled off these walls

26:20.100 --> 26:23.059
that somehow you've all been too
stupid to even try and repair...

26:23.103 --> 26:24.278
Uh, we fixed that --

26:24.321 --> 26:26.889
Oh,
you fixed part of it.

26:26.933 --> 26:31.633
You slapped up some
anti-demonic monster warding.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.635
You didn't come close
to restoring

26:33.679 --> 26:35.637
the original,
cosmic-grade stuff.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.160
Okay. Then,
how do we restore it?

26:37.204 --> 26:41.251
Well, you can't --
not permanently.

26:41.295 --> 26:44.951
But I know how to get it
back up -- for a while.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.737
But it won't be enough.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.653
This good-enough warding,

26:51.697 --> 26:55.831
I'm gonna have to juice it up,
feed it.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.312
I'm gonna need to
borrow your angel.

26:58.355 --> 26:59.922
And with all that,

26:59.966 --> 27:01.750
you think that'll keep us
off of Chuck's radar?

27:01.794 --> 27:04.623
Better hope so.

27:27.602 --> 27:33.869
Magia, quae olim inhaeserat
in his symbolis,

27:33.913 --> 27:40.180
nunc depletis,
reducatur, reducatur.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.172
How you feeling
'bout this?

28:16.216 --> 28:17.739
Honestly?

28:17.783 --> 28:20.699
Feels like we're taking
a big, probably stupid risk.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.615
Feels good.

28:24.659 --> 28:28.010
Disobeying
cosmic entities,

28:28.054 --> 28:31.927
doing the, uh...dumb,
right thing?

28:34.408 --> 28:35.452
Feels like we're back.

28:41.110 --> 28:45.201
Hey, thanks for staying,
keep an eye on the reaper.

28:45.245 --> 28:49.553
Yeah, um...

28:49.597 --> 28:53.383
Jody, I-I'd -- I'd like to
ask you to stay, as well.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.951
What is that? Some kind of
B.S. male chivalry thing?

28:55.995 --> 28:57.300
No.

28:57.344 --> 29:00.739
No, it's not.
Jody, it's, um...

29:00.782 --> 29:02.392
Well, you know...

29:02.436 --> 29:05.308
I was never able to
make things right with Claire,

29:05.352 --> 29:06.788
what I took from her.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.268
I mean...

29:08.311 --> 29:09.965
I'm never gonna be able
to make that right.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.662
But...

29:11.706 --> 29:14.622
you and Claire found each other,
and she has you now.

29:14.665 --> 29:19.627
If something goes wrong
with this rescue, and...

29:19.670 --> 29:23.500
and Kaia isn't saved...

29:23.544 --> 29:26.503
Claire will be devastated,
but she'll survive --

29:26.547 --> 29:28.636
she already has.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.943
But if she loses you both...

29:36.209 --> 29:38.341
That'd kill her.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.343
Yeah.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.345
Castiel?

29:42.389 --> 29:44.565
Ready when you are.

29:47.350 --> 29:49.309
Thanks.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.155
Alright, Jack.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.983
You're up.

30:55.810 --> 30:57.856
How's it feel
to be back?

31:03.949 --> 31:05.689
Good talk.

31:05.733 --> 31:07.213
Okay.
Where is she?

31:22.141 --> 31:23.403
What?

31:33.587 --> 31:34.588
Aw, crap.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.724
Do we fight 'em?

31:40.768 --> 31:43.423
No. This many?
You'd lose.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.947
Well,
they seem hungry.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.385
They're not hungry.

31:49.429 --> 31:52.258
They're scared.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.391
Scared of what,
you?

31:55.435 --> 31:57.959
No, this.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.622
Let's go.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.516
What is that?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.431
My home.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.085
Kaia!

32:40.393 --> 32:42.830
Kaia!

32:42.873 --> 32:46.007
Kaia!

32:47.661 --> 32:49.097
Kaia?

33:01.849 --> 33:06.027
Hey, kid.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.473
No, Kaia, it's okay.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.475
She helped us
find you.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.912
We should go.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.138
Come on!

33:30.182 --> 33:31.531
No, I'm staying!

33:31.574 --> 33:33.011
What?!

33:33.054 --> 33:35.143
This is my home.
I never should have left it.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.319
You'll die.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.018
I don't belong
in your world.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.020
You do.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.153
Go.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.330
GO!

33:48.374 --> 33:49.940
Come on!

34:34.333 --> 34:35.899
Kaia.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.579
Told you they'd fit.

35:03.623 --> 35:07.105
They do, uh...
kind of.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.455
They're clean.

35:13.720 --> 35:17.680
How'd you survive alone...
all that time?

35:20.379 --> 35:22.816
Miss Mary Mack.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.821
The nursery rhyme.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.826
My mom used to...

35:32.869 --> 35:35.568
Um...

35:37.570 --> 35:39.485
Doesn't matter.

35:46.535 --> 35:50.148
So...
what do I do now?

35:50.191 --> 35:53.455
Well, uh, if you want,

35:53.499 --> 35:56.197
come back to Sioux Falls,
my home.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.681
Will Claire be there?

36:01.724 --> 36:04.292
She will be. Soon.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.996
Thank you.

36:37.369 --> 36:40.676
If I cared for a second
about saving that girl,

36:40.720 --> 36:42.939
I guess I'd say
that was a victory.

36:42.983 --> 36:44.332
So you think
the warding worked,

36:44.376 --> 36:45.725
kept us off
Chuck's radar?

36:45.768 --> 36:47.596
If it hadn't,
we would all be dead,

36:47.640 --> 36:50.208
so I'd say,
yeah, it worked.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.566
Hello, boys.

37:14.188 --> 37:16.799
What the hell?

37:24.764 --> 37:27.375
Bending the rules already,
Jack?

37:27.419 --> 37:28.898
Billie...

37:28.942 --> 37:30.117
I tried to call you.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.727
I know.

37:31.771 --> 37:34.730
I was busy.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.558
Can't say I'm not disappointed,
though.

37:36.602 --> 37:37.733
Disappointed?

37:37.777 --> 37:39.257
You just iced
one of your reapers.

37:39.300 --> 37:43.739
Merle had one job --
keep you in line.

37:43.783 --> 37:46.394
She failed.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.179
We're playing
a big game here,

37:49.223 --> 37:52.574
and we're only as strong
as our weakest players.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.272
She had to go.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.448
That's the difference
between you and me.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.624
I see the big picture.

37:58.667 --> 38:02.584
I understand that one life means
nothing in the grand scheme.

38:02.628 --> 38:05.500
That girl you saved
from a dying world,

38:05.544 --> 38:07.285
you think hers
was the only one?

38:07.328 --> 38:09.417
They're all dying.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.681
All the worlds --
each and every world --

38:12.725 --> 38:13.943
but this one.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.815
It's Chuck.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.121
Mm-hmm.

38:18.165 --> 38:21.951
He's been a busy boy --
extinguishing galaxies.

38:21.995 --> 38:25.215
Wiping the slate clean --
for the end.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.956
Sam: Yeah, and what's
your endgame, Billie?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.437
I mean, you lecture us about
how important all this is,

38:29.481 --> 38:31.526
but we don't even know
what you're doing.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.659
Jack's gonna kill God, right?
Yeah?

38:33.702 --> 38:36.314
Great.
Okay. How?

38:36.357 --> 38:37.793
What's your plan?

38:37.837 --> 38:41.971
When I was a reaper,
I believed in the rules.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.973
But then you killed me.

38:45.758 --> 38:48.195
And when I became Death,

38:48.238 --> 38:50.893
I inherited
Death's knowledge...

38:50.937 --> 38:53.156
and Death's library.

38:53.200 --> 38:57.509
And in Death's library,
everyone has a book.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.511
Even God.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.382
So God can die.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.471
Everything dies.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.473
At the end,
I'll reap him, too.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.388
God?

39:07.432 --> 39:08.868
You'll reap God?

39:08.911 --> 39:10.173
Oh, yes.

39:10.217 --> 39:11.827
Castiel:
I don't understand.

39:11.871 --> 39:15.178
Why would God write
the blueprint to his own death?

39:15.222 --> 39:16.484
He didn't.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.834
The books
write themselves.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.666
After God made the world,
he couldn't stop.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.189
He wanted more.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.278
But he needed to create
a perfect harmony --

39:28.322 --> 39:30.542
a Swiss watch,
so this world

39:30.585 --> 39:33.719
could keep tick tick ticking
in his absence.

39:33.762 --> 39:38.506
He had no choice but to build
himself into the framework.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.595
It's his only weakness.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.597
So Chuck doesn't know
what's inside the book?

39:42.641 --> 39:45.774
No one can read their books
unless I let them.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.602
What about Jack?

39:47.646 --> 39:49.561
He's in God's book?

39:49.604 --> 39:51.911
And so are you.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.436
I told you, Dean --

39:55.480 --> 39:58.091
you and your brother
have work to do.

39:58.134 --> 40:01.573
This is your destiny.

40:01.616 --> 40:06.099
You are the messengers
of God's destruction.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.576
Are you finished,
sir?

40:48.620 --> 40:49.664
Is that all of them?

40:49.708 --> 40:51.753
Nah.
Not yet.

40:51.797 --> 40:54.277
You know,
unwinding whole worlds,

40:54.321 --> 40:57.280
some take a snap,
but others are more complex.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.587
They'll need more time.

40:59.631 --> 41:01.937
Attention.

41:01.981 --> 41:05.985
But you'll spare us,
though...right?

41:08.335 --> 41:10.511
I mean,
I've served you for weeks.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.687
I'll be okay, right?

41:19.346 --> 41:21.348
You'll be fine.

41:23.045 --> 41:24.830
Everything's just fine.
