11:57.064 --> 11:58.587
I bought a ring.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.849
For-for my girlfriend.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.808
Yeah, I wasgonna propose,

12:01.851 --> 12:05.463
but, um... she broke up
with me, so...

12:05.507 --> 12:06.508
Well, sorry.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.552
Oh, it's okay.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.728
Um, I'll survive.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.555
And in regards
to Guiding Hope,

12:10.599 --> 12:12.383
your recent, uh,
cash revenue increase,

12:12.427 --> 12:13.558
that-that caught
my attention, as well.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.256
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh...

12:15.299 --> 12:17.475
So, we, uh,
we recently started a...

12:17.519 --> 12:19.260
uh, dog grooming service.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.348
Yeah.And it's mobile.

12:20.391 --> 12:23.090
So we can go to the dogs.Oh.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.961
Dogs can come to us.Oh, it's on wheels.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.528
And then all
of our proceeds

12:26.571 --> 12:27.659
are going to our
guide dog school, so...

12:27.703 --> 12:28.835
Yes, we're gonna
shampoo, conditioner.

12:28.878 --> 12:29.879
It's all,
you know...

12:29.923 --> 12:30.880
And it's been...

12:30.924 --> 12:31.925
a-awesome.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.187
It's doing really well.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.666
Like, very...Oh, it's super successful.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.320
Really, really well.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.714
There you go-- engagement
ring, dog grooming.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.542
I think we're done here.

12:40.585 --> 12:41.891
That's it?

12:41.935 --> 12:43.458
Well, actually...Yeah, that's it.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.416
Just send us the books
to back that up

12:45.460 --> 12:47.679
when you have a chance.
Our address is on the card.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.507
And you owe melunch now.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.510
Thanks very muchfor your time.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.685
Yes, of course.No problem.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.776
Thank you.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.126
Enjoy the States.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.605
[door closes]

13:00.649 --> 13:02.259
Are they gone?

13:02.303 --> 13:04.435
I think I'm
gonna throw up.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.395
So, come on,why are you really here?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.005
Do you need money?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.441
No, actually.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.879
Uh, my company
is doing extremely well.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.445
Huh.

13:14.489 --> 13:15.577
And how are you?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.579
Good.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.973
Still single, I presume?

13:20.016 --> 13:22.105
Actually, I, uh...

13:22.149 --> 13:24.281
have a girlfriend.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.413
No, you don't.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.849
[laughs]

13:26.893 --> 13:29.983
Shall I open up yourfavorite Bordeaux for you?

13:30.026 --> 13:32.289
Okay, she's not,
like, officially

13:32.333 --> 13:34.596
my girlfriend, but I am...

13:34.639 --> 13:36.424
seeing someone.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.078
Pretty serious.

13:38.121 --> 13:41.037
Oh, is it that, uh,
Jess friend of yours?

13:41.081 --> 13:43.257
Nope, she's still gay.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.346
Who isn't these days?

13:45.389 --> 13:47.174
Her name is Chelsea.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.176
What does Chelsea do for work?

13:49.219 --> 13:50.786
She's a bartender.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.049
Oh, Fee.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.834
Unlike you and everyone else
in this family,

13:54.877 --> 13:57.227
I like people for who they are,not for their pedigree.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.968
Just use protection, okay?

13:59.012 --> 14:01.666
I don't need you knocking upsome bartender, okay?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.755
I need... I need a gun.What?

14:03.799 --> 14:06.062
I need a gun.
That's why I'm here.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.368
Okay, Mom? I need a gun.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.457
Why?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.329
Because there's a vagrant
in my building's alleyway

14:12.373 --> 14:15.506
threatening me,
and I told the cops.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.943
They don't do anything.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.074
And I just...

14:18.118 --> 14:20.772
want to feel safe, so...

14:20.816 --> 14:22.470
here I am.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.691
I'm proud of you.

14:26.735 --> 14:29.781
You have a right
to defend yourself.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.308
[glasses clink]

14:34.351 --> 14:36.701
Well, he couldn't
have gone far.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.399
So that means we're close?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.271
Wow, that's exciting.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.752
Listen, uh,
I'm gonna check the motels.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.581
Why don't you search the mall
and the surrounding wherever?

14:46.624 --> 14:47.930
You think he's in there?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.018
What, is he shopping?

14:49.062 --> 14:51.760
Just cover your bases, okay?

14:55.764 --> 14:57.592
I'll do that.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.117
[clears throat]

15:01.161 --> 15:03.815
What would you say your
most valuable trait is?

15:03.859 --> 15:05.295
I'm very punctual

15:05.339 --> 15:08.429
and, uh, loyal,I guess.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.474
You don't have
any food service experience?

15:10.518 --> 15:12.433
Uh, that's true.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.391
But you didn't have
food service experience

15:14.435 --> 15:16.132
till someone took
a chance on you.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.481
Yeah.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.267
Um, you don't have
any references on here.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.834
Oh, that's 'cause the,
uh, template I used

15:22.878 --> 15:24.271
didn't have a space
for references.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.142
Look, uh, Darnell...

15:26.186 --> 15:28.362
Wait, uh...

15:28.405 --> 15:30.277
I've been on ten of these.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.366
I knowmy résumé sucks,

15:32.409 --> 15:33.933
but I really need a job.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.543
I will work really hard.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.720
Okay.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.940
I... got to get back.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.080
[birds chirping, dogs barking]

15:51.124 --> 15:53.474
Do you think
they bought it?

15:53.517 --> 15:55.476
They seemed to.

15:55.519 --> 15:58.435
Nice lie, by the way,with the, uh, engagement ring.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.220
Thank you.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.223
I-I really...

16:03.266 --> 16:04.789
I really do thinkwe're fine,

16:04.833 --> 16:07.053
but we should just...
to be safe, we should just

16:07.096 --> 16:08.793
get the truck ready
as soon as possible.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.795
Yeah... I know.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.449
I-I'm trying.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.364
Where the hell
is Felix?Probably buying

16:14.408 --> 16:16.410
17th-century armor for his
nonexistent battle with Sam.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.020
Just have your wifey help you.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.326
No, I...

16:19.369 --> 16:21.067
I can't, I can't
be around her.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.459
It's a phys-physical
problem.

16:22.503 --> 16:23.808
What was that?

16:23.852 --> 16:25.680
Yesterday, I masturbated
to her Instagram.

16:25.723 --> 16:26.811
Oh, Jess!

16:26.855 --> 16:29.336
I know, I'm gross.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.863
What are you guys doing?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.560
Nothing.Hey, uh,that dude's here

16:36.604 --> 16:38.649
to see you.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.390
You got to be more specific.

16:40.434 --> 16:43.176
[door slams]Bruh.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.699
Come on, Pretzel.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.267
[door creaks]

16:50.748 --> 16:52.054
[sighs]

16:53.403 --> 16:54.404
Murphy.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.102
It's Josh Wallace.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.452
We met earlier.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.019
Have you got a second?

17:09.767 --> 17:12.161
So, what's up?
Did you see I took out $20

17:12.205 --> 17:14.294
from an ATM three years ago
or something?

17:14.337 --> 17:15.730
No, it's my dog, Oliver.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.514
He could use a bath
and a haircut,

17:17.558 --> 17:19.342
so I thought I'd
give this, uh,

17:19.386 --> 17:20.387
this grooming
service a go.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.910
Oh.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.303
Hi, Oliver.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.044
Oh, I-I tied him
to a bench outside.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.307
I saw your
"service dogs only" sign.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.135
A rule follower.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.832
Love it, um...

17:30.875 --> 17:33.400
Yeah, why don't you, why don't
you just give me a second.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.531
I'm gonna go talk with Jess.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.185
She... she takes care
of our grooming.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.621
Oh, I-I'll grab Ollie.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.536
Okay.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.799
Great.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.977
Find outside.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.509
Hey, Ollie.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.643
Jess!

18:01.384 --> 18:03.038
Don't freak out.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.039
Huh?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.258
The guy from the IRS is back.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.824
And he brought his dog.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.435
And he wants us to groom it.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.958
Well, tell him that...
that we're busy,

18:10.001 --> 18:11.481
that we're booked up
and that we're busy

18:11.525 --> 18:13.048
or whatever!No, he walked by the truck.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.789
He must have seen
that it was not in use.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.576
You're just gonna haveto groom the dog.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.839
Where? We don't have a
grooming truck, Murphy.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.451
All that we have is a-a mini
fridge and a cutting board.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.844
And most importantly, I don't
know how to groom a dog!

18:26.888 --> 18:28.455
Don't they teach you that
in vet school?

18:28.498 --> 18:30.500
They do not.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.502
Sterling.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.635
She know...

18:34.678 --> 18:36.158
She knows how to do it.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.464
Your spank bank Sterling?

18:37.507 --> 18:39.901
Yes. I looked at her résumé.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.468
She worked at
PetSmart for a year.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.687
Just put your boner away
and get her to help you.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.167
No, I don't...Come with me!

18:45.211 --> 18:46.560
Murphy... [groans]

18:54.524 --> 18:56.178
[Murphy and Jess
chattering indistinctly]

18:56.222 --> 18:57.397
I don't know what more
to tell you.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.660
Hi... again.Hi.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.227
Jess here is gonna
take Oliver back

19:01.270 --> 19:03.316
and give him a nice cut
and a bath.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.752
Oh, thanks for squeezing him in.

19:04.795 --> 19:08.234
Of course. We had alast-minute cancellation, so...

19:08.277 --> 19:11.498
Hi, mister.Hi. Okay, well,

19:11.541 --> 19:14.283
we're gonna takegood care of you.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.851
Come on.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.941
Well, I didn't even ask
how much it is.

19:19.984 --> 19:23.466
30. It's 30.That's it?

19:23.510 --> 19:24.989
That's why we're so popular.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.774
So you can just, uh,you can just come back

19:26.817 --> 19:28.079
in about an hour or so,

19:28.123 --> 19:29.429
and he'll beall nice and pretty.

19:29.472 --> 19:32.171
Oh. Well, I'd like to stay,
if that's all right.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.824
And maybe you could
give me a tour?

19:36.566 --> 19:38.525
Be delighted.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.529
Okay, now...

19:42.572 --> 19:45.358
the pistol has
more mag capacity,

19:45.401 --> 19:48.448
but the revolver has
fewer jam issues.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.232
Which one do you want?

19:50.276 --> 19:53.409
The one with fewerjam issues, I guess.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.413
Okay.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.546
Do you need me to show
you how to use it?

19:59.589 --> 20:01.243
No. I think I got it.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.289
Are you sure, now?Mom, I got it.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.204
Thank you. [scoffs]

20:05.247 --> 20:06.683
REPORTER:
That cold front that hit

20:06.727 --> 20:09.686
Northern Illinois last night
is still going strong.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.646
We will be dealing witha large amount of snow and sleet

20:12.689 --> 20:14.822
with highs today in the low 30s.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.564
Freezing temperatures...[takes deep breath]

20:17.607 --> 20:21.481
[TV broadcast
continues indistinctly]

20:21.524 --> 20:23.352
Hey, is there, uh...
is there anywhere close

20:23.396 --> 20:26.268
I can order a pizza from?

20:26.312 --> 20:28.488
Thanks.

20:28.531 --> 20:29.924
[door squeaks open]

20:31.534 --> 20:34.363
Hi, Oliver.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.104
Hi.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.062
I, uh, thought this wasa grooming van.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.586
Uh, it is. Yeah.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.327
Um, well, I'm making it one.

20:41.370 --> 20:44.634
Yeah, that guy is, like,
a really big donor,

20:44.678 --> 20:49.248
so we may have... inflated
the readiness of the van.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.684
So you lied to your donor?

20:50.727 --> 20:52.512
Yeah.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.470
Okay, good.'Cause that makes me feel

20:54.514 --> 20:56.472
a lot better aboutlying on my résumé.What?

20:56.516 --> 20:57.734
What do you mean?Mmm,

20:57.778 --> 21:00.520
I sort of never, uh,worked at PetSmart.

21:00.563 --> 21:01.521
Okay.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.436
Yeah. I just, I really

21:03.479 --> 21:04.480
needed this job.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.743
Hey, we'll-we'llfigure it out.
