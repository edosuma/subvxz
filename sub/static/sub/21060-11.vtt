-* Bad boys, bad boys,

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

-Crawl out!

Hold it! Hold it!

-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:40.233
in a court of law.

00:42.767 --> 00:45.333
-Corporal Michael Milazzo:
Been doing this job
for about 12 years now,

00:45.367 --> 00:47.433
One of the favorite things
to do is--

00:47.467 --> 00:50.867
is locate and apprehend suspects
with illegal g--

00:50.900 --> 00:52.967
illegal guns
and illegal narcotics.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.533
-(radio chatter)

00:54.567 --> 00:56.400
-Gives-- gives me
a sense of purpose,

00:56.433 --> 00:58.267
like, getting guns
and drugs off the street.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.900
It's a way to make
the community safer.

01:01.767 --> 01:03.533
All right, we have--
one of our units is behind

01:03.567 --> 01:05.500
an occupied
stolen vehicle right now.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.167
We're gonna try
to get behind the vehicle

01:07.200 --> 01:09.533
and assist 'em when we get
the vehicle stopped.

01:09.567 --> 01:13.200
It's gonna be that blue car
in front of the unit.

01:13.233 --> 01:17.200
-Man (over radio):
Yo, Dave, if y'all are close,
they're on... (indistinct).

01:17.233 --> 01:19.700
-Man 2 (over radio):
I'm on University
and Johnston right now.

01:19.733 --> 01:22.700
-Milazzo:
He's probably
gonna take off on us.

01:22.733 --> 01:25.400
-Man (over radio):
Go ahead and force the route.
We'll wait and see what he does,

01:25.433 --> 01:28.400
see which way he goes.
I don't want to endanger
anybody in the public.

01:28.433 --> 01:31.600
-(radio chatter)
-We got-- we got
a Mardi Gras parade

01:31.633 --> 01:34.367
going on right now
just ahead of us,
so we don't want to light it up.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.133
-Man (over radio): Stay off
the radio. I'm coming up.

01:36.167 --> 01:39.233
-Milazzo: A lot of times,
it'll turn into vehicle pursuits
with stolen vehicles,

01:39.267 --> 01:40.967
so we're going to give it
a little bit of time

01:41.067 --> 01:43.233
and try to get out of the area
before it turns into a pursuit,

01:43.267 --> 01:45.933
that way it's less risk
to the public.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.433
-(radio chatter)
-Milazzo: We got a K9 that's
gonna jump in front of us.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.667
-(radio chirps)
-That's K9 behind you, Scott.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.433
We're past the parade route now.

01:55.067 --> 01:57.833
-(sirens blaring)
-He's gonna run.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.767
We're gonna have
a little pursuit here.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.533
-(radio chirps)
-Taking a university approach.
Now passing Simcoe.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.433
Speed is at... 60.

02:10.867 --> 02:13.533
We have enough units.
Everybody else... (indistinct).
-(siren blaring)

02:15.967 --> 02:19.133
--Man (over radio): Mike,
you want me to try and spike him
at Willow and University?

02:19.167 --> 02:20.933
-(radio chirps)
-Milazzo: Yeah, 10-4.

02:20.967 --> 02:22.967
Passing Cameron right now,

02:23.067 --> 02:25.700
so... get 'em out in time.

02:27.433 --> 02:30.767
-Man (over radio):
Whole area, assist with
the vehicle description, please.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.967
-Yeah, we--
I don't think we have sight
of the vehicle anymore.

02:34.067 --> 02:36.600
-(radio chatter)
-Man (over radio): 10-4.

02:36.633 --> 02:39.700
If you're back in that area,
y'all start spreading out
in that area.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.133
-Milazzo:
Due to the traffic,
we backed off

02:42.167 --> 02:43.933
and-- and we lost sight
of the vehicle,

02:43.967 --> 02:47.067
but we have someone
that's able to track
the vehicle with GPS.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.667
So, we're attempting
to get an updated location
of the vehicle

02:49.700 --> 02:52.067
and see
if we can locate it again

02:52.100 --> 02:54.767
and... try and get it stopped.
-Man (over radio): Hey, we're
back at Four Corners.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.300
He's southbound,
going southbound.

02:59.767 --> 03:03.100
-(siren blaring)
-Milazzo: All right,
we have a K9 unit

03:03.133 --> 03:05.200
that's back in pursuit
of the stolen vehicle,

03:05.233 --> 03:08.367
southbound on one of the--
one of our main thoroughfares.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.667
All right?

03:11.867 --> 03:14.800
So, we're trying get up
in the area to assist 'em.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.467
-Man (over radio):
Cameron approaching
San Antoine,

03:16.500 --> 03:17.633
head towards the thruway.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.300
-Milazzo: Cameron. He's--
-(radio chirps)

03:19.333 --> 03:21.533
-I'm coming
down San Antoine now, Dave.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.467
-(man yells on radio)

03:23.500 --> 03:26.200
-Milazzo: He just bailed.
He just bailed. It's gonna
be a foot bail.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.433
I think he wrecked
right up here.

03:28.467 --> 03:30.600
The vehicle just crashed
and bailed right ahead of us.

03:30.633 --> 03:33.167
-Man (over radio):
On Cameron and Pierce.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.767
-Woman (over radio):
10-4. Cameron and Pierce.
-Milazzo: He got a light pole.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.433
They got him at gunpoint.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.800
-(sirens blaring)

03:50.567 --> 03:52.733
-(gunshots)
-(glass shatters)

03:56.367 --> 03:57.767
-(dog barks)

04:00.933 --> 04:01.933
-Back up.

04:05.867 --> 04:08.333
-Crawl out this way. Crawl--
Watch out, watch out.

04:10.567 --> 04:13.067
-Crawl out! Crawl out!
-I'm coming out.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.567
-(man yells)

04:19.267 --> 04:22.400
-(handcuffs clicking)

04:22.433 --> 04:24.100
-Are you hurt or injured?
-No.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.733
-No? (grunts)

04:27.400 --> 04:29.933
-(radio chatter)
-Officer: Mike, Mike, Mike,
Mike, you want to be careful.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.367
He got wires down there...
-All right.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.533
-...that'll light.
I don't know if they're
live or not.

04:33.567 --> 04:34.900
-You want me to sit up?
-Sit up, man.

04:34.933 --> 04:36.867
-Sit up. Sit up.
Cross your legs.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.067
-There you go.
-Thank you.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.900
-There wasn't nothing on him.
-Whose vehicle is that?

04:44.933 --> 04:47.067
-Man: Uh, it was
my ex-girlfriend's.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.400
-Your girlfriend's,
is that correct?

04:48.433 --> 04:50.433
-Like, my ex.
-Ex-girlfriend?

04:50.467 --> 04:52.300
-Yeah.
-How long has it been ex?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.800
-Uh, we were--
-Like, when you stole
the vehicle, it became ex?

04:54.833 --> 04:57.500
-Just about, yeah, yeah.
-Y'all been having some trouble
for a while?

04:57.533 --> 05:00.367
-Right then,
right when I did that.
-Okay, why didn't you just stop?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.800
-Huh?
-You saw the lights behind you.
Why didn't you just stop?

05:02.833 --> 05:05.600
-Uh, I just wanted to die, yeah.
-You just wanted to die?

05:05.633 --> 05:08.067
-Yeah. I'm... tired.

05:08.067 --> 05:10.100
-You've been arrested before?
-No.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.767
-Never for stolen vehicle?
-No.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.533
-First time getting arrested?
-Yeah, for anything.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.667
-So, what got into you today,
to make you do all this?

05:16.700 --> 05:19.067
-Drugs.
-What kind of drugs you do, man?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.133
-Smoke a lot of weed.
I don't know.
-Weed?

05:22.167 --> 05:24.667
-Yeah.
-Anything besides weed
or just weed?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.967
-I used to, like,
trip a lot, but that's it.

05:27.067 --> 05:28.400
-Acid?
-Yeah.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.667
-Nothing else? Anything today?

05:30.700 --> 05:33.433
-Hm-mmm.
I think I smoked earlier today.

05:33.467 --> 05:36.667
-Marijuana?
-Like-- yeah. Like-- yeah.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.533
-Is it worth all this?
-Oh God, no. No, no.

05:39.567 --> 05:41.867
-Well, I mean-- do--
-Yeah. No, trust me.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.067
-It boggles my mind that
you're just laughing about
the whole thing and then--

05:45.067 --> 05:46.900
-I mean, 'cause I don't know
what the (bleeps) I'm doing.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.367
I mean, like,
what the (bleeps) was that?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.233
I don't know.
-So?

05:50.267 --> 05:52.667
-Yeah. I mean,
I used to be in engineering.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.533
Used to--
-Used to be
an engineering student?

05:54.567 --> 05:56.533
-Used to use my brain.
-How old are you?

05:56.567 --> 05:58.267
-Twenty-one.
I just turned 21.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.333
-You in school right now?
-Uh-uh.

06:00.367 --> 06:03.600
-What gets me is you're just
kinda nonchalant, laughing
about it the whole time.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.167
-Yeah, that's what
gets everyone, I guess.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.833
-You know, you're lucky--
you're lucky the K9 didn't--

06:08.867 --> 06:11.667
-Yeah, that dog-- jeez.
That's an official dog.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.400
That was awesome.
-Yeah, they're good dogs.

06:13.433 --> 06:15.467
-I was like, "Oh my God!"
-You're lucky the passenger
airbag is

06:15.500 --> 06:17.800
what slowed the dog down.
-I know! Definitely
slowed it down.

06:17.833 --> 06:20.267
-It's like, "Holy (bleeps)."
-I mean, you-- you're lucky,

06:20.300 --> 06:22.733
considering how fast
you were driving and
you didn't hurt yourself,

06:22.767 --> 06:24.167
somebody else...
-Yeah, I was--

06:24.200 --> 06:26.533
-...one of us.
Or that dog didn't do--

06:26.567 --> 06:28.667
didn't do
more damage than it did.
-Well, I'm alive now.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.333
I just really wanted to die.
-What's that?

06:30.367 --> 06:32.067
-I'm glad I'm alive now,
I guess.

06:32.067 --> 06:34.433
-You feel like
you want to die now?
Or do you want--

06:34.467 --> 06:36.067
-I just wanna...
-You wanna live.

06:36.067 --> 06:37.633
-...get over this slump...

06:37.667 --> 06:39.867
-All right, well,
this is what's gonna happen.
-...and then-- yeah?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.133
-Due to the minor dog bite...
-Uh-huh.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.400
-...and the crash...
-Uh-huh.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.067
-...you're gonna
be taken down to the hospital,

06:45.067 --> 06:46.267
get you checked out...
-Okay. Okay.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.633
-...get you clear
for incarceration,

06:47.667 --> 06:49.567
and then we'll bring you down--
down to Lafayette

06:49.600 --> 06:51.067
to the Parish jail.
-Sounds good.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.633
-All right,
anymore questions, man?

06:52.667 --> 06:54.733
-Thanks for pulling me over,
'cause I'm glad I didn't
kill anyone.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.300
-Well, I was hoping you'd
pull over. That's the problem,
you didn't pull over.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.067
-Oh yeah, well, I pulled over,
and then, you know...

06:59.067 --> 07:00.500
-Can't be that thankful.
-Pulled over now.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.200
-All right, man.
Hang tight.

07:04.933 --> 07:07.233
He's a character.
Said he wanted to die,

07:07.267 --> 07:08.500
that's why he was driving
like that.

07:08.533 --> 07:10.333
And once we got him out,
he says he's okay,

07:10.367 --> 07:11.767
now he wants to live, so.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.800
-Well, good.
-And so-- I mean,
he's all over the place, so.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.067
-Well, at least
we have him now and we have
him safe, so all right.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.767
-Milazzo:
Awesome, man. Good job.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.900
-Officer Domingue:
Born and raised here
in Louisiana.

07:24.933 --> 07:26.633
I've lived here all my life.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.067
I enjoy...

07:28.100 --> 07:30.867
various outdoor activities,
hunting and fishing,

07:30.900 --> 07:33.967
horses. I've had horses
pretty much all my life.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.433
I love training horses.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.967
One good thing
about Lafayette PD,

07:37.067 --> 07:39.467
they offer a mounted
patrol division,

07:39.500 --> 07:41.500
which I was lucky--
lucky enough to be a part of.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.200
-(radio chatter)
-(siren blaring)

07:43.233 --> 07:45.467
-Committed an armed robbery,
at a local convenience store.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.933
-Man (over radio):
Hey, the Cadillac's 2-11.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.733
-We have a Cadillac
that's fleeing from us.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.867
We're trying
to catch up to him.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.967
-Officer (over radio):
He just almost hit me.
Hold your traffic.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.867
He just... (indistinct)
Hold your traffic.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.567
-Dispatcher:
Did you just get him out?

07:56.600 --> 07:58.233
-Man:
The driver's
still in the Cadillac.

07:58.267 --> 07:59.800
He just... (indistinct).

07:59.833 --> 08:02.167
He's right here! I need a K9.
He's right here by the car.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.567
He's right outside the car.
I don't think he has a gun
on him now.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.067
Just lock it down!
-(Domingue grunting)

08:12.933 --> 08:14.433
-(officers shouting)

08:14.467 --> 08:15.700
-Domingue:
Let me see your hands!

08:17.067 --> 08:19.400
-(man screams)
Okay!

08:20.733 --> 08:22.333
-(grunts)
-(screams)

08:22.367 --> 08:23.900
What the hell?

08:23.933 --> 08:25.233
-Officer: Hey!

08:29.733 --> 08:31.667
-All right, man.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.333
-(dog barking)

08:34.367 --> 08:35.467
-Hey!

08:35.500 --> 08:37.533
-(dog barks)

08:43.100 --> 08:44.833
-Okay. Watch him.

08:44.867 --> 08:48.333
(sirens blaring)

08:48.367 --> 08:51.333
-(dog barking)

08:51.367 --> 08:55.200
-Roll over, man.
-(grunts) I can't breathe.
I can't--

08:55.233 --> 08:57.400
-(dog barking)
-I don't have...
I don't have nothing.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.100
-I can't breathe, brah.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.967
-Roll over, though. Roll over.
-I can't breathe.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.800
I can't-- Hey!
(screams)

09:03.833 --> 09:05.833
-(indistinct radio chatter)

09:05.867 --> 09:08.667
-(man mumbling)

09:08.700 --> 09:10.267
-Stand him up?
-Stand him up.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.067
-(man muttering)
-Stand up, man.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.133
-(barking continues)

09:15.167 --> 09:17.267
-Okay, John,
walk you to your car.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.400
-I can't-- I can't walk.
Officer, my--

09:19.433 --> 09:21.933
-You should've thought
about that before you ran
from the police.

09:21.967 --> 09:24.433
-(radio chatter)
-(man grunts)

09:24.467 --> 09:26.400
-You checked him?
-Check him again.
I've checked him once,

09:26.433 --> 09:28.167
but check him again.
-What's his name?

09:28.200 --> 09:30.767
-Domingue: What's going on, man?
-My partner flashed out
on ol' boy over there,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.300
through the store,
man, like-- man.

09:32.333 --> 09:34.300
That's my car
he was driving, brah.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.500
-That's you-- Wait. What?
-That's my car. That's my car
he was driving, man.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.500
-This right here?
-Yeah, that's my car, sir.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.600
-And you were dri--
-No, I--

09:41.633 --> 09:45.633
I was-- look, I was--
I was trying to help my partners
to the gas pump.

09:45.667 --> 09:48.167
He got a flat,
and the other one,

09:48.200 --> 09:50.767
he had a (bleeps) gun
on him, bro, like--

09:50.800 --> 09:52.367
-He had a--
Which one had a gun?

09:52.400 --> 09:55.067
-The one that took off
running the first time
before we stopped.

09:55.067 --> 09:56.433
-The first time?
-Yeah.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.300
There was another person
who took off running just now?

09:58.333 --> 09:59.733
-Yeah.
-When you stopped. Okay.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.700
-There was-- there was--
there was-- there was
two of 'em, man.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.033
Like-- But that's my car.
-Okay.

10:04.067 --> 10:05.833
-All right?
-Yeah, do me a favor
and sit down.

10:05.867 --> 10:07.100
-Man: Yes, sir.
-Domingue: Come on.

10:07.133 --> 10:08.700
-Man: Boss man,
my chest is really hurting.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.433
-All right.
-We got an ambulance en route.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.867
-Ah. Boss man, my chest--
my chest hurting.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.767
-Hey, we got the a--
we got the ambulance
coming for you.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.833
-Ahh!
-You probably should've
thought about all that, huh?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.400
Before all this.
-Man! Man, I was scared
for my life!

10:20.433 --> 10:22.400
Man, the dude-- the dude--
the dude pulled a gun out on--

10:22.433 --> 10:24.667
man, the dude that-that--
that done the robbery
and (bleeps),

10:24.700 --> 10:27.767
then pulled a gun out on me,
telling me to keep going
in my car, man.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.933
-Well, you should be careful
who you hang out with, man.

10:29.967 --> 10:31.900
-(groaning)
-You can't just trust anybody.

10:31.933 --> 10:34.833
-That dude-- man, that's the car
under my mama name, brah.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.533
-(groans)

10:36.567 --> 10:38.067
-It's a little ice chest
right here.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.067
It has some kind of gun
that was used in the... robbery.

10:41.100 --> 10:45.267
We're gonna go ahead
and grab that.
Looks like a mask.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.067
-Officer:
Hey, look. See, we got--
We got another mask right here.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.000
-He left the drag marks here.
-Yeah.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.433
So, he hit the car...

10:54.633 --> 10:56.200
-The car was here,
and they hit it and pushed it

10:56.233 --> 10:58.167
all the way over there.
-I guarantee that
he came out left--

10:58.200 --> 10:59.733
-We look even more, man,
he might--

10:59.767 --> 11:03.067
-The car crashed.
We recovered these items
that were used in the robbery.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.400
Um, this isn't a real gun.
CO2 powered,

11:05.433 --> 11:08.300
but it obviously looks
like a real gun.

11:08.333 --> 11:11.500
And nevertheless, it was...
used in committing the robbery.

11:11.533 --> 11:14.100
-(radio chatter)

11:14.133 --> 11:15.667
-Basically, we got a call

11:15.700 --> 11:17.300
that an armed robbery
was occurring

11:17.333 --> 11:19.133
at a local convenience store.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.300
We had some officers
that were in the area.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.367
They witnessed
the suspect vehicle

11:23.400 --> 11:25.533
flee from the area
of the crime

11:25.567 --> 11:28.233
and got in a brief pursuit
with the vehicle.

11:28.267 --> 11:31.167
They lost sight of the vehicle,
and two passengers
in the vehicle

11:31.200 --> 11:32.767
bailed out of the vehicle.

11:32.800 --> 11:36.900
Uh, after that point,
the driver of the suspect
vehicle continued

11:36.933 --> 11:39.300
and got in a crash.
Three guns involved.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.933
Two of the guns,
from what I'm understanding,

11:40.967 --> 11:42.567
were already recovered.

11:44.267 --> 11:48.933
And the, uh, the victim
was pretty much robbed of cash

11:48.967 --> 11:50.533
and a gun.
He had a gun, too.

11:50.567 --> 11:52.300
So, that's where
we at right now.
-All right.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.067
-All right, my man. Um...

11:57.133 --> 11:59.167
you're gonna be charged
with armed robbery,

11:59.200 --> 12:00.800
and reckless operation, okay?

12:00.833 --> 12:02.533
-Armed robbery?
-Yes, sir.

12:02.567 --> 12:05.767
-Huh?
-You had-- you had
the guns in your car.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.867
You had--
-I had guns in my car?

12:07.900 --> 12:09.200
-You had the masks.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.933
-It was all--
it was all in your car,

12:11.967 --> 12:13.633
and you-- and you
were running from us.

12:13.667 --> 12:14.767
-But guess what.
-All right?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.433
My partner called
and told me that he had a flat

12:16.467 --> 12:19.133
at the-- at the--
at the air pump machine.

12:19.167 --> 12:21.300
So, you went
over there by yourself
to help him with his tire?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.900
-No, I went
over there, it was me--
I was driving, all right?

12:23.933 --> 12:26.333
But when I got down
to help him,

12:26.367 --> 12:28.733
I seen one of 'em jump
on my driver's seat...

12:28.767 --> 12:31.300
-Mm-hmm.
-...and the other one,
in the red jacket--

12:31.333 --> 12:33.867
the one I'm
talking about took off--
he the one that robbed--

12:33.900 --> 12:36.067
he the one that robbed
the guy at the gas pump.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.967
My partner, man,
like, (bleeps), man.

12:38.067 --> 12:41.733
The dude that put me at gunpoint
told me if I stopped my car,
"I'ma kill you."

12:41.767 --> 12:43.533
Boss man, what I'm saying is,

12:43.567 --> 12:46.167
if somebody got you at gunpoint
and telling you, "Keep going,"

12:46.200 --> 12:47.833
what are you gonna do?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.533
-Well, whenever they jumped
out at-- on-- sir--

12:49.567 --> 12:52.400
you sure took-took--
went to the driver's seat--
-One of 'em jumped out.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.167
-Why did you go
to the driver's seat?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.133
-My car--
-And started fleeing?

12:56.167 --> 12:57.900
-All right.
Understand what I'm saying?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.500
-The only reason why I went
to the driver's seat

12:59.533 --> 13:01.367
'cause my car
was still rolling, right?
-Mm-hmm.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.633
-And the dude that was still--
there was three of them.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.267
And the dude
that was still in there...
-Mm-hmm.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.800
-...put me at gunpoint
and told me that if I stopped
my car right now,

13:07.833 --> 13:09.533
he's gonna pop me,
gonna shoot me.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.067
So, what you want me to do?
You want me to--

13:11.067 --> 13:12.767
you want me to stop
or keep going?
-Okay.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.467
-Think about it.
-All right. All right. Well,

13:14.500 --> 13:17.267
you still made that decision.
You'll have your day in court,
all right?

13:17.300 --> 13:19.333
-Man: It's not
a problem, boss man.
-Domingue: All right, then.

13:22.967 --> 13:24.433
-Deputy Polson:
Me and my brother
both started

13:24.467 --> 13:26.633
in January
of 2009 in the academy,
the same day.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.567
We're the first two
in our family

13:28.600 --> 13:30.067
to get into law enforcement.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.600
So, we had friends
in the industry before

13:32.633 --> 13:34.767
and kind of fell in love
with the work, you know?

13:34.800 --> 13:37.067
We-- Kind of
a high-call volume here,

13:37.067 --> 13:38.533
especially on the weekends.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.267
About to make a stop
on this vehicle.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.133
It's, uh... it's traveling

13:42.167 --> 13:43.733
westbound on the road,
just got a headlight out.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.600
So, just gonna make contact
with the driver.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.467
21-35. It's gonna be
a tan-colored Ford Focus.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.900
I... (indistinct)
multiple times.

14:03.067 --> 14:06.233
Hello, ma'am. I stopped you
due to the fact that you have
one of your headlights out.

14:06.267 --> 14:08.067
Is this your vehicle?
-What? Yeah.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.167
-Where are you coming from?
-Picked-- I picked
my friends up.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.833
We went to the gas station,
and now I'm going.

14:11.867 --> 14:13.900
-Okay. Do you have
any weapons in the vehicle,

14:13.933 --> 14:15.667
any narcotics,
or anything like that?

14:15.700 --> 14:17.233
No? Nothing in the vehicle?
You sure now?

14:17.267 --> 14:18.900
-No.
-Okay.

14:18.933 --> 14:21.167
All right,
give me one second.

14:23.233 --> 14:24.933
There's four subjects
in the vehicle.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.167
I see, uh...
there's prior heroin use there

14:27.200 --> 14:29.100
and all the indicators.
Let's try and--

14:29.133 --> 14:30.700
If you can get
on the other side,
ID those two.

14:30.733 --> 14:34.067
Probable cause for arrest
on this guy for another charge.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.200
Can you roll this window
down for me?

14:36.233 --> 14:37.600
Roll your back windows down.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.567
All right,
everybody step out for me.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.467
You don't have
any weapons on you,
do you, buddy?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.933
-No. No.
-Tell you what's going on
here in a minute.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.433
-All right.
-(handcuffs click)

14:46.467 --> 14:49.400
-You high right now?
Just bring him back here.
-(handcuffs click)

14:49.433 --> 14:51.633
Come over here, bud.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.300
-(man mumbles)
-You got nothing on you?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.233
-Huh?
-I asked what's going on?

14:56.267 --> 14:57.800
-Officer: Yeah,
I'll tell you in a minute.

14:57.833 --> 15:00.167
-Polson:
Why don't you all come stand
right over here by this door.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.067
Just right over here.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.467
-(radio chatter)

15:06.333 --> 15:08.400
-All right, you can--
Sir, keep your hands out
of your pockets.

15:08.433 --> 15:09.867
I don't know if you have
any weapons on you.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.867
Okay? So, just stand by
one second.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.400
She's got a lot
of self-inflicted injuries

15:14.433 --> 15:19.067
that are consistent
with meth use and heroin use,

15:19.067 --> 15:21.667
so we're conducting a search
to see what we can locate here.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.300
There's probably gonna be
some narcotics in this vehicle.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.100
-Officer: Oh, right here.
-Polson: What you got?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.600
-Right there.
-Oh yeah.

15:28.967 --> 15:31.167
Where was that?
-It was wrapped in a blanket.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.133
It was under the seat.
That blanket was underneath
the seat.

15:33.167 --> 15:36.533
-Okay. First look at her--
the scars and marks
that she has on her

15:36.567 --> 15:40.300
is an indication
of usually two types of drugs,
meth and heroin.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.967
And this is--
this is heroin, so it was
spot on to what I suspected.

15:44.067 --> 15:47.567
One of the subjects had
this cannabis oil, which--

15:47.600 --> 15:49.733
-Officer:
It may be legal in other states,
but not in Florida.

15:49.767 --> 15:52.500
-Polson:
And also, Suboxone.

15:52.533 --> 15:56.167
She had a spoon here and
a ton of little baggies here,

15:56.200 --> 15:58.167
most of them are all empty.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.067
So, you knew
what was in the purse?

16:02.067 --> 16:04.200
-I had no-- I had no idea, sir.
-Polson: You didn't know
it was there?

16:04.233 --> 16:06.067
-No, sir. I promise.
-All right.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.767
So, you've never used
heroin before?

16:07.800 --> 16:11.633
-Yeah, I've used heroin
before, previously, right?
-Right. Right.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.467
-But but my roommates
actually are--

16:14.500 --> 16:17.133
-How long ago
did you use heroin,
last time you used heroin?

16:17.167 --> 16:23.200
-I'm not using.
I actually just signed myself
for fricking detox.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.800
-Polson: Okay.
-Yeah, I really don't--

16:24.833 --> 16:27.233
It hasn't been long.
-Oh no, 'cause looking--
looking at your face,

16:27.267 --> 16:30.100
you know, your arms--
-I know. I got...

16:30.133 --> 16:33.900
My-- my roommates again,
she had like a bunch of abscess.

16:33.933 --> 16:35.933
I don't know if I touched
something that she touched.

16:35.967 --> 16:38.300
-No.
-And I promise you--
I promise you,

16:38.333 --> 16:40.800
it's not from--
I don't shoot in my face.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.133
-Have you looked
in the mirror and seen
what this is doing to you?

16:43.167 --> 16:45.433
-Yeah. Oh yeah.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
-Yeah, well, there's--

16:45.467 --> 16:47.833
There's no--
-I have a fricking Quasimodo

16:47.867 --> 16:50.233
coming out of the side
of my face, because I was

16:50.267 --> 16:53.200
stressing out
and picked my face,

16:53.233 --> 16:55.367
and I guess touch--
-It's not just that.
It's your arms--

16:55.400 --> 16:57.067
it's everywhere.
You pick yourself to pieces.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.300
That's what
that stuff does to you.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.600
You're tearing yourself apart.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.500
All right. Come walk
over here for me.

17:01.533 --> 17:03.600
You're under arrest
for, uh, the heroin,

17:03.633 --> 17:04.900
plus paraphernalia.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.500
I need to work on him.

17:08.533 --> 17:10.800
She looks like
she's heavy into heroin.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.400
All right, man, so you have
the CBD oil in your pocket.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.433
-Yes.
-Okay, all right.
We're in Florida.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.200
It's not legal yet in Florida.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.733
-It is. I bought it in--
I bought it in a smoke shop.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.267
I can show you.
I have receipts.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.067
-Polson:
What smoke shop
did you buy it from?

17:23.067 --> 17:25.733
-It says it on-- it says it
on every smoke shop now.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.067
It's a legal substance.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.500
It's pharmaceutical-grade
cannabinoid--

17:30.533 --> 17:33.700
can-cannabinoid oil.
-What smoke shop
did you buy it from?

17:33.733 --> 17:36.200
-Uh, every smoke shop
down 19 will sell it.

17:36.233 --> 17:38.633
-There is six dispensaries
in the state of Florida

17:38.667 --> 17:41.200
that is going to carry
what is legal in Florida.

17:41.233 --> 17:43.900
-Yes, you're talking
about marijuana.
This is an oil.

17:43.933 --> 17:45.600
-It tests positive for THC.

17:45.633 --> 17:48.933
-Uh, oh, okay, um--
-It may have started out
as an oil, but what else

17:48.967 --> 17:51.633
did you put in there?
-They-- they sell it in--
they sell it in the mall.

17:51.667 --> 17:52.933
-Okay.
-The vape shops.

17:52.967 --> 17:54.133
-They don't sell that
in the mall.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.833
-Yes, they do.
-What is in that bottle

17:55.867 --> 17:58.133
tested positive
for tetrahydrocannabinol.

17:58.167 --> 18:01.800
-Uh, Christopher,
did I did not--
did I not pay seven--

18:01.833 --> 18:04.400
$179 in a smoke shop--

18:04.433 --> 18:06.733
in a legal smoke shop
for that oil?
-No comment.

18:06.767 --> 18:10.200
-I swear to God to you.
-Okay. All right. Come over,
come over here.

18:10.233 --> 18:12.333
-Am I being arrested?
-Yeah, you're under arrest

18:12.367 --> 18:15.133
for, uh, possession
of a substance
that contains THC.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.367
-Sir, I'm not lying to you.
-Can you get Brown
out of transport?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.833
-I know you get lied to
all the time.

18:18.867 --> 18:21.467
I promise you, I bought that
in a legal smoke shop.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.400
-Stand right here.

18:23.433 --> 18:26.433
I wouldn't--
-All right, have a seat, bro.

18:26.467 --> 18:30.067
-Sir, I would
never break the law. I'm--
-Have a seat.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.167
-All right, put your legs in.
-Sir, this is--

18:32.200 --> 18:34.433
Please, you have to--
-All right, give some room
for your buddy,

18:34.467 --> 18:36.767
'cause he's gonna be
in here in a second.
-Sir, I don't understand.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.167
-Officer: Slide--
-Polson: You're going to jail.
That's what's going on.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.533
All right, come with me.
I'm gonna put you in this
other car over here.

18:41.567 --> 18:44.067
-Can I have my phone?
Can you do that, please?
-Yeah, we'll work on that.

18:44.067 --> 18:45.933
-(man mumbles)
-Over here.

18:45.967 --> 18:49.100
-Oh, you slammed me into the car
with... (indistinct).

18:49.133 --> 18:50.767
All right, man. Have a seat.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.367
-(grunts)

18:53.400 --> 18:55.067
-Polson: All right.
-All right.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.767
-Polson: All right, bro.
So in addition to--
what this officer is gonna

18:57.800 --> 19:00.833
take you to jail for that little
argument or whatever you said
you had earlier.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.333
-The physical altercation?
-Right. Right.

19:02.367 --> 19:05.400
When we talked about the bong,
you said it was your brother's.

19:05.433 --> 19:08.100
So you're also gonna have
a paraphernalia charge,
gonna be for the bong.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.233
-All right, so how's it...
(indistinct)?

19:10.267 --> 19:11.900
-You'll have to find out
when you get to the jail.

19:11.933 --> 19:14.300
-Man 2:
Hey, can you please go get--

19:14.333 --> 19:15.900
Can you tell Sean
to bring me my wallet?
-Yeah.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.567
We're gonna look
for your phone and your wallet.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.167
All right, man.
You're free to go.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.933
But what was he supposed
to use the CBD oil for?

19:22.967 --> 19:26.233
-Actually, it's supposed
to help you if you w--
were using that stuff.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.467
It helps--
Supposed to help wean you off.
-Like to get off of using?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.733
-Like to get off of using?
-Yes. Yes.

19:30.767 --> 19:33.233
-Okay. Then what's
the Suboxone for?

19:33.267 --> 19:34.767
I mean, that's what
that's supposed to be for.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.167
-Suboxone's for opiates.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.567
-So, he's getting off
opiates too?

19:37.600 --> 19:41.100
-Mm-hmm.
He used to have...
a lot of problems.

19:41.133 --> 19:42.433
-Okay.
-Got problems.

19:42.467 --> 19:44.933
-All right. You know,
you get pulled over in a car,

19:44.967 --> 19:46.967
and everybody around you
is going to jail,

19:47.067 --> 19:48.967
probably a bad group
to be hanging with.
-Man 3: Right.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.833
Cover is code three.

19:55.867 --> 19:58.833
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.500 --> 20:06.467
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.667
-(theme music playing)
