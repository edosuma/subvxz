02:20.032 --> 02:22.468
Cruz, where are ya?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.003
Sir, I think
we're about to find

02:24.136 --> 02:26.738
this rotating brothel
we're looking for.

02:26.871 --> 02:29.707
Well, you better damn
well be right this time.

02:30.909 --> 02:32.811
We just found our fourth victim.

02:34.346 --> 02:37.916
Same pattern.

02:38.050 --> 02:40.519
Scalp torn off her head.

02:40.652 --> 02:42.587
About 70% of her skin missing

02:42.720 --> 02:45.690
and whitish patches
on the rest of her body.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.193
It's him again.

02:47.326 --> 02:48.593
The Cradle.

02:48.726 --> 02:50.362
Yeah, another hooker.

02:52.198 --> 02:53.299
Same tattoo.

02:53.432 --> 02:56.701
These girls were branded
by the same employer.

02:56.835 --> 02:59.671
And this man doesn't work alone.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.873
We need to dig deeper.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.676
I think he's got a
pimp helping him.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.078
Be alert.

03:06.212 --> 03:08.880
This maniac is capable
of inflicting real pain.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.682
Send me the location.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.228
Dude, you look like crap.

03:25.397 --> 03:26.831
This is it.

03:42.047 --> 03:45.050
- Let's check our cameras.
- Yeah.

03:47.486 --> 03:52.158
Remember, look for an
albino woman when we find him.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.658
Got it.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.795
Get inside.

04:06.671 --> 04:10.909
Good evening, gentlemen,
and welcome to The Silk Club.

04:11.043 --> 04:16.548
May your wildest and
most erotic dreams come true.

04:41.906 --> 04:42.907
Hi.

04:43.042 --> 04:45.411
You see the main
desk over there?

04:45.544 --> 04:48.880
Go pay my fees, and
they'll give you a red coin.

04:49.014 --> 04:50.282
Bring it back to me,

04:50.416 --> 04:53.619
and I'll take you inside
for 15-minute ride.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.495
How old are you?

05:03.629 --> 05:04.729
Why do you ask?

05:04.862 --> 05:06.798
Are you in love with me?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.534
You should get out of here.

05:08.667 --> 05:09.602
Let me go!

05:09.734 --> 05:11.736
Tony, come on, man.

05:11.869 --> 05:14.473
You better control
your looney friend.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.675
I'm gonna take a look around.

05:29.655 --> 05:32.291
No! No!

05:32.424 --> 05:33.626
No me jodas más!

05:33.758 --> 05:35.327
Baboso!

05:37.129 --> 05:40.933
Quieres un blowjob, papi?

06:32.917 --> 06:34.320
FBI! Don't move!

06:34.453 --> 06:36.955
Put your hands
above your head now!

06:42.995 --> 06:44.496
Let the girl go.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.602
You're under arrest.

06:50.736 --> 06:52.304
Freeze, don't move.

06:52.438 --> 06:56.608
Yeah, I need you to dispatch
backup at 3955 East 5th Street.

06:56.742 --> 07:00.245
With your right hand,
take off your sunglasses. Now!

07:02.781 --> 07:04.882
Make it slow.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.371
Tony!

07:29.708 --> 07:31.310
Tony!

08:03.075 --> 08:05.210
What is happening to this man?

08:10.783 --> 08:11.583
Tony!

08:11.717 --> 08:12.651
- Hey
- Hey.

08:12.785 --> 08:14.019
Just give me one second.

08:14.153 --> 08:16.021
Tony! What's up?
It's good to see you, man.

08:16.155 --> 08:17.423
Look at you.
You look great, you look great.

08:17.556 --> 08:19.091
Come on in.
Everyone's here.

08:19.224 --> 08:20.459
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hey, man, so where you been?

08:20.592 --> 08:22.861
At some Buddhist
retreat or something?

08:22.995 --> 08:24.163
Nah, seriously, man,
it's been, like,

08:24.296 --> 08:25.531
10 months since
you've left the Bureau.

08:25.664 --> 08:27.032
What's going on?

08:27.166 --> 08:28.634
I didn't leave.
They let me go.

08:28.767 --> 08:30.536
Eh, whatever.
Did you find another job?

08:30.669 --> 08:33.138
- I'm not in a rush.
- Ah! Why would you be?

08:33.272 --> 08:35.073
Hey, man, come here,
let me get you a drink.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.208
Now, I have to apologize, right?

08:37.342 --> 08:39.812
My girl forgot beer,
so we're all stuck drowning

08:39.945 --> 08:41.980
in this pink invention of hers.

08:42.114 --> 08:44.249
It's her birthday, so you
can't really complain, right?

08:45.851 --> 08:47.886
Johnny, you shouldn't be
talking about my cocktail

08:48.020 --> 08:49.855
- behind my back.
- Sweetie!

08:49.988 --> 08:51.256
How was it that you could be

08:51.390 --> 08:52.724
having a conversation
with your friends

08:52.858 --> 08:55.027
and still be listening
to what we're saying?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.896
Let me rephrase:
this is delicious.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.565
Mmm.

08:59.698 --> 09:01.500
Meet Doris.
This is my birthday girl.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.235
Now be careful,
she's a psychiatrist,

09:03.368 --> 09:07.105
so she's probably
checking you out as we speak.

09:07.239 --> 09:09.141
Hello, Tony.

09:09.274 --> 09:11.610
Oh, so you guys
know each other?

09:11.743 --> 09:13.712
Dr. Doris Baxter.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.180
Turn it on, turn it off.

09:15.314 --> 09:17.449
What is this turn it on,
turn it off thing

09:17.583 --> 09:18.984
- you guys are talking about?
- Hey, Johnny!

09:19.117 --> 09:20.853
Oh, beer.
Beer is here!

09:20.986 --> 09:23.655
All right, guys, listen.
You guys... and hey, be careful.

09:23.789 --> 09:24.923
This is the woman I love.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.763
So, two sessions...

09:31.897 --> 09:35.100
and you never came back.
Why?

09:35.234 --> 09:38.871
Let's say... I went
down to Machu Picchu.

09:39.004 --> 09:42.674
I hope you found the
peace you were looking for.

09:42.808 --> 09:46.879
I think so.
I lost a lot of money trying.

09:47.012 --> 09:48.580
Oh, I'm glad.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.583
About what?
That I lost my money?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.819
I'm happy for you.
I... I was concerned.

09:53.953 --> 09:57.689
I... I thought for sure
you had this certain...

09:57.823 --> 10:00.826
I'm totally recovered.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.227
I'm moving on with my life.

10:02.361 --> 10:05.999
Look at me. I'm here.

10:06.131 --> 10:09.268
Doris, I need to leave!

10:09.401 --> 10:10.636
Stay... stay till
we cut the cake.

10:10.769 --> 10:11.837
One second.

10:13.305 --> 10:14.840
Hey, everybody, come on.

10:14.974 --> 10:16.542
Let's gather around and sing
happy birthday to my woman.

10:16.675 --> 10:17.743
Come on!

10:17.876 --> 10:20.846
♪ Happy
birthday to you ♪

10:22.147 --> 10:24.716
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

10:38.430 --> 10:39.999
- Doris?!
- What is it?

10:40.132 --> 10:41.867
Look at him.

10:46.738 --> 10:50.375
They've checked
every part of your brain.

10:50.509 --> 10:51.610
The protein markers for

10:51.743 --> 10:53.745
the three most
prevalent brain cancers

10:53.879 --> 10:55.447
turned up negative.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.516
Blood thymine level was normal.

10:57.649 --> 11:00.252
And there are no signs
of tumor on the CAT scan.

11:00.385 --> 11:02.588
The test results
were conclusive.

11:02.721 --> 11:05.791
They can't help you
with your problem, Tony.

11:05.924 --> 11:08.393
But... I can.

11:08.527 --> 11:12.831
You have a psychological
disorder called nyctophobia.

11:12.966 --> 11:14.333
It's a fear of the dark.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.335
It's a part of a
generalized anxiety disorder,

11:16.468 --> 11:20.706
and it is more common in
children, rarely in adults.

11:20.839 --> 11:23.275
Do you often have
heart palpitations

11:23.408 --> 11:26.345
and excessive sweating

11:26.478 --> 11:29.314
and... breathlessness?

11:29.448 --> 11:33.452
Maybe even... the
fear that you're dying?

11:33.585 --> 11:35.420
This is serious, Tony.

11:35.554 --> 11:38.290
You are a highly decorated
FBI agent

11:38.423 --> 11:41.393
and you had a
full-blown anxiety attack.

11:41.526 --> 11:45.031
Have you had these
symptoms before?

11:45.163 --> 11:46.966
Who's this?

11:47.100 --> 11:48.266
That's my father.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.203
Answer the questions, Tony.

12:00.947 --> 12:04.783
We had something
similar at my mom's house.

12:04.916 --> 12:07.252
That was a long time ago.

12:09.821 --> 12:12.491
Okay, Tony.
It's your turn.

12:12.624 --> 12:15.594
Tell me the name and the
meaning of those flowers.

12:19.431 --> 12:21.733
Tony, what's wrong?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.201
Tony, don't be silent.

12:23.335 --> 12:26.039
Silence is a box
we need to open.

12:30.342 --> 12:32.744
Daisies.
It means loyal love.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.679
Yes.

12:33.812 --> 12:35.213
Mom, your name
should be Daisy.

12:43.156 --> 12:45.490
Whoa.

12:45.624 --> 12:47.693
I keep telling you,
I don't care...

12:47.826 --> 12:49.528
Mo... Mom?

12:49.661 --> 12:52.065
I didn't say that.
It's none of my business.

12:52.197 --> 12:53.632
Nothing to worry about.

12:53.765 --> 12:56.668
Don't ever show people
that you're afraid.

12:58.537 --> 13:01.974
Look, I have a little
trick when I feel scared.

13:02.108 --> 13:04.409
I whistle a nice melody
and my fears go away.

13:04.543 --> 13:05.777
You wanna hear it?

13:17.422 --> 13:19.624
But Mom, Tony can't whistle.

13:21.060 --> 13:24.262
Oh, well, come here, young man.
We gotta fix that.

13:24.396 --> 13:25.831
Come down here.

13:25.965 --> 13:28.667
We are gonna make an ocarina
with your hands, okay?

13:28.800 --> 13:31.636
So, chop your left hand
with your right hand

13:31.770 --> 13:34.339
right where your fingers
meet the palm... hiyah!

13:36.142 --> 13:38.577
See, this is a bird trap.

13:38.710 --> 13:42.048
Now, you leave a hole open
for the birdy can breathe.

13:42.181 --> 13:45.118
And then you put your lips
to the knuckles of your thumb

13:45.250 --> 13:47.987
and you blow into the hole.

13:49.488 --> 13:50.689
No, no, no, not so
hard, not so hard.

13:50.822 --> 13:52.125
It's not a trumpet.

13:52.257 --> 13:53.592
Try it again.

13:57.562 --> 14:00.265
With a little
practice, you'll get it.

14:00.398 --> 14:01.666
Let's play hide-and-seek!

14:01.800 --> 14:04.569
Ah!

14:06.872 --> 14:09.175
Ten...

14:09.307 --> 14:12.011
nine...

14:12.145 --> 14:14.813
eight...

14:14.947 --> 14:17.749
seven...

14:17.883 --> 14:20.585
six...

14:20.719 --> 14:21.920
five...

14:22.054 --> 14:24.656
Don't hide under the
floor like you always do!

14:27.692 --> 14:29.394
Four...

14:32.231 --> 14:33.532
...three...

14:36.102 --> 14:37.602
...two...

14:39.304 --> 14:40.705
...one!

14:50.882 --> 14:52.417
Tony?

15:26.852 --> 15:29.621
- Hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.824
It's my car.
Such an old model.

15:32.959 --> 15:34.826
I think it ran out
of water again.

15:34.961 --> 15:36.628
I'm wondering if
you could help me out.

15:36.761 --> 15:37.896
Oh yeah, yeah, don't worry.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.531
I'll, uh... I'll
bring a container.

15:39.664 --> 15:41.067
- You can fill it with our hose.
- Thank you.

15:54.180 --> 15:57.549
So this is... this is the only
thing I could really find.

15:57.682 --> 16:00.418
It's so cozy in here.

16:03.289 --> 16:05.091
I love your daughter's skin.

16:05.224 --> 16:06.391
What did you just say?

16:06.524 --> 16:07.994
Oh!

16:18.204 --> 16:19.571
Where is she?!

16:21.473 --> 16:23.109
Where is she?!

16:32.385 --> 16:33.518
I knew it!

16:33.652 --> 16:35.420
- I knew you were in here.
- Shh, shh, shh.

16:50.468 --> 16:54.472
Let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

16:54.606 --> 16:58.344
Man of the house.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.279
Help! My mom!

17:07.185 --> 17:11.089
If you don't tell me
where your sister is

17:11.223 --> 17:14.426
by the time
this alarm goes off...

17:16.295 --> 17:17.862
...I'm gonna let
the judges' panel

17:17.997 --> 17:20.199
take care of the situation.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.300
Let me introduce them to you.

17:23.768 --> 17:25.704
This
is a blind judge.

17:25.837 --> 17:28.606
This is the indolent man.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.176
And this?

17:30.309 --> 17:33.412
This one's the ugly judge.

17:33.578 --> 17:36.514
Now, if you don't answer me...

17:36.648 --> 17:39.884
the indolent man
will turn the other way.

17:40.019 --> 17:41.420
And the ugly judge
will ask me

17:41.553 --> 17:44.789
to rip open your
mother's stomach!

17:44.923 --> 17:46.225
Talk!

17:46.359 --> 17:49.861
Let me go! Mama!

17:49.996 --> 17:51.529
Where
is your sister?!

17:51.663 --> 17:52.630
Let me go!

17:52.764 --> 17:54.766
Where is she?!

17:54.899 --> 17:57.303
Where is your sister?

17:57.436 --> 17:58.304
No!

17:58.437 --> 17:59.972
Where is your sister?

18:01.573 --> 18:03.708
Let me go!
Let me go!

18:03.842 --> 18:05.643
You'll die if
you don't tell me.

18:05.777 --> 18:07.545
No, no!

18:14.353 --> 18:16.188
What are you looking at?

18:17.655 --> 18:19.225
Stay here!

18:27.665 --> 18:29.601
Where... where are you?!

18:34.507 --> 18:36.541
No, no, no, no!

18:36.674 --> 18:37.977
No!

18:45.484 --> 18:48.020
Mama!
Mama, is that you?

18:49.388 --> 18:52.425
I stayed hidden
like a weakling

18:52.557 --> 18:54.393
in that dark hole.

18:54.527 --> 18:57.329
No air except for that crack.

18:57.463 --> 19:00.399
It smelled like sewage
or something rotten.

19:01.866 --> 19:04.669
How long
were you in there?

19:04.803 --> 19:06.939
Three days.

19:26.658 --> 19:28.027
Let's get out of here.

19:32.932 --> 19:34.632
I was
sent back to Venezuela

19:34.766 --> 19:36.734
to be raised by my aunt.

19:38.736 --> 19:42.341
I couldn't stand being in
the dark for several years.

20:13.805 --> 20:17.076
I finally
got over my fear.

20:20.812 --> 20:22.515
Until I saw the same man

20:22.647 --> 20:26.218
in... in the brothel that night.

20:26.352 --> 20:28.686
It happened again.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.788
Did they ever
find your sister?

20:36.328 --> 20:37.662
It was my fault.

20:37.795 --> 20:40.132
No, Tony.

20:40.266 --> 20:43.202
I left the chair
under the attic.

20:43.335 --> 20:44.537
That's how he found her.

20:44.669 --> 20:46.305
Don't you see?

20:49.308 --> 20:50.943
No.

20:51.076 --> 20:54.013
You cannot blame yourself.

20:54.146 --> 20:58.551
You were just a child.

20:58.683 --> 21:01.453
Tony...

21:01.587 --> 21:02.988
these anxiety episodes

21:03.122 --> 21:06.425
will keep coming over
and over and over until...

21:06.559 --> 21:08.160
Until what?

21:10.396 --> 21:15.301
Until you realize that
it wasn't your fault.

21:16.801 --> 21:19.672
I care for you, and I want
you to come see me again.

21:19.804 --> 21:21.540
Okay?

21:21.674 --> 21:24.909
For now,
take this prescription.

21:25.044 --> 21:26.844
Take as directed.

21:26.979 --> 21:29.481
One will help you
get some sleep.

21:29.615 --> 21:31.749
The other is a mood stabilizer.

21:31.883 --> 21:34.687
Do not stop taking suddenly.

21:34.819 --> 21:36.488
Call me anytime.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.326
Rocco.

21:40.459 --> 21:42.894
Dude, you look like crap.

21:43.028 --> 21:45.397
Don't pity me.
I'll be back on my feet soon.

21:45.531 --> 21:47.865
Trust me.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.069
Take that.

21:50.202 --> 21:51.736
I got a friend
that's gonna get you a job

21:51.869 --> 21:54.106
at Dan Crawford's residence.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.441
Yes, it's the Dan Crawford

21:55.574 --> 21:57.643
you're thinking of,
the billionaire.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.145
Look, Rocco, I
appreciate it, but no.

22:00.279 --> 22:02.914
Tony, please, you have
got to take this job.

22:03.048 --> 22:05.217
Look for a lead that
will get you to The Cradle.

22:05.351 --> 22:07.586
I found a match in one
of the hookers' cell phone

22:07.720 --> 22:09.121
back at the brothel.

22:09.255 --> 22:12.391
It is none other than
Rebecca Crawford's number.

22:12.524 --> 22:14.326
The old man's wife.

22:14.460 --> 22:17.129
We can use her to find
the next rotating brothel.

22:17.263 --> 22:20.032
We already know The Cradle
frequents these places.

22:20.165 --> 22:22.034
If you work for them...

22:22.167 --> 22:24.336
you could tail
her ass everywhere.

22:26.672 --> 22:28.474
Here's a GPS tracking device.

22:28.607 --> 22:31.744
Link this to your cell phone
and hide it in her car.

22:31.876 --> 22:34.947
You can find her
any time you need to.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.983
And nobody at the Bureau
knows anything about it.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.835
Good evening.
Good evening.

23:29.702 --> 23:30.669
Wolfsbane!

23:30.803 --> 23:32.171
Be careful!

23:33.871 --> 23:35.140
I didn't mean to scare you.

23:35.274 --> 23:39.244
That flower, it contains
alkaloid pseudaconitine,

23:39.378 --> 23:41.680
a poison that was
used to hunt wolves.

23:41.814 --> 23:45.517
Had I know that, I'dve
given it to my last boyfriend.

23:45.651 --> 23:48.520
- Who are you?
- I'm not a party crasher.

23:50.356 --> 23:54.059
I'm the one who
organized this party.

23:54.193 --> 23:57.129
I just didn't want them
to see me dressed like this.

23:57.262 --> 23:58.896
Are you a new driver?

23:59.031 --> 24:01.333
Not exactly, but
you could say that.

24:03.435 --> 24:06.105
You must be the event planner.

24:06.238 --> 24:09.475
Not exactly, but
you could say that.

24:09.608 --> 24:11.844
You have great
taste in flowers.

24:11.977 --> 24:15.848
Plumerias, cannas,
bleeding hearts,

24:15.981 --> 24:17.416
and white lotus on the fountain.

24:17.549 --> 24:20.386
I guess the bees are gonna
have an orgy tomorrow.

24:20.519 --> 24:22.554
The new chauffeur
is a botanist?

24:22.688 --> 24:23.856
Just an amateur.

24:23.989 --> 24:26.291
My mother was a
skilled gardener.

24:26.425 --> 24:28.893
Hm. Well, then
surely she taught you

24:29.027 --> 24:31.563
about an ancient legend
that says

24:31.697 --> 24:36.568
if you close your eyes
and caress a flower's bud...

24:36.702 --> 24:39.271
then somewhere, a girl
grows up safe and sound.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.907
Done.

24:43.041 --> 24:45.511
I helped a girl.

24:45.644 --> 24:47.146
It was nice to meet you.

24:49.314 --> 24:51.316
- What was your name?
- Tony.

24:52.751 --> 24:55.053
- Here's my card.
- Mm.

24:55.187 --> 24:57.389
In case you need a driver.

24:57.523 --> 24:59.658
You should come and
see the show I planned.

25:01.427 --> 25:03.228
It should start any time.

25:09.835 --> 25:11.937
Shut down your mouth.

25:12.070 --> 25:16.775
As if you had not seen another
woman so beautiful in your life.

25:16.909 --> 25:18.644
Actually, no.

25:18.777 --> 25:21.146
You don't know her?

25:21.280 --> 25:23.882
It's Rebecca Crawford,
our boss's wife.

26:10.095 --> 26:12.364
Table for one, Dennis?

26:12.498 --> 26:14.766
I think you're taking me
for someone else, ma'am.

26:16.301 --> 26:18.537
Are you following
me or not, Dennis?

26:18.670 --> 26:20.005
Jeez!

26:26.111 --> 26:29.748
Kudos to the new driver.
You finally made it here.

26:29.882 --> 26:31.116
I apologize.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.185
Last night, I didn't know
that you were...

26:33.318 --> 26:34.954
well, I mean, that you are...

26:35.087 --> 26:36.655
The thing is,
I was hired two days ago

26:36.788 --> 26:38.924
to be part of
your security staff...

26:39.057 --> 26:40.158
Aren't private eye detectives

26:40.292 --> 26:42.227
a little out of fashion
nowadays?

26:43.462 --> 26:44.696
My husband hired
you to follow me,

26:44.830 --> 26:46.665
he should provide you
a better car.

26:46.798 --> 26:47.900
Sit down.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.405
Well, look who's here!

26:53.539 --> 26:57.142
How's life treating
you, buddy girl, huh?

26:57.276 --> 26:58.777
Now, don't tell
me what you want.

26:58.911 --> 27:02.214
A New York egg cream
is coming right away.

27:02.347 --> 27:03.682
You're such a darling.
Make it two.

27:03.815 --> 27:06.818
- I want him to try it.
- You got it.

27:11.024 --> 27:12.558
It's nothing against you.

27:12.691 --> 27:15.627
I'm just allergic to bodyguards
walking in mute mode next to me.

27:15.761 --> 27:19.765
You won't even
notice that I'm around.

27:19.898 --> 27:21.433
Heh.

27:22.167 --> 27:24.037
I'll tell ya what.

27:24.169 --> 27:26.738
You keep your job by...

27:26.872 --> 27:31.777
walking my dog and getting me
things from the grocery store.

27:31.910 --> 27:34.346
Is that okay with you?

27:34.479 --> 27:35.914
Yeah.

27:36.049 --> 27:38.017
I'm thrilled by
my new assignment.

27:38.150 --> 27:40.285
What's the name of the puppy?

27:40.419 --> 27:42.588
Curvy. Would you
like to see a picture?

27:42.721 --> 27:43.789
Do I need to?

27:43.922 --> 27:46.258
They say dogs look
like their owners.

27:48.193 --> 27:50.195
I'll take that
as a compliment.

27:50.329 --> 27:51.965
Check it out for yourself.

27:54.733 --> 27:57.202
My Curvy is the next
best thing to an angel.

27:59.371 --> 28:01.373
Now that I know my new task,

28:01.506 --> 28:03.241
I think I better
go and wait outside.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.876
I'll escort you back home.

28:05.011 --> 28:06.812
You don't need
to wait outside.

28:06.946 --> 28:11.149
Here you go!
The two absolute finest

28:11.283 --> 28:14.087
New York egg creams
in the world.

28:14.219 --> 28:15.587
Thank you, darling.

28:15.721 --> 28:17.056
Enjoy.

28:23.428 --> 28:27.666
Sweetener.
Do you want some?

28:27.799 --> 28:29.368
No, thanks.

28:32.204 --> 28:34.107
Are you angry or something?

28:34.239 --> 28:35.108
Relax!

28:35.240 --> 28:37.242
Enjoy your drink.

28:37.376 --> 28:39.311
Have fun at work.

28:42.614 --> 28:44.883
Look at us, getting
to know each other.

28:45.018 --> 28:47.120
Establishing boundaries.

28:47.252 --> 28:50.355
Exchanging information.

28:50.489 --> 28:52.591
You get to know your employer.

28:54.493 --> 28:56.628
I get to know my employee.

29:05.737 --> 29:07.205
Uh, where are the napkins?

29:07.339 --> 29:10.208
Can you grab me a napkin
from that table, please?

29:20.218 --> 29:22.989
Don't forget that.

29:23.122 --> 29:24.456
Grab one.

29:24.589 --> 29:27.126
You seem to me like a man
who needs a bad habit.

29:36.468 --> 29:38.603
Cheers.

29:38.737 --> 29:40.472
This is on the house, honey.

29:40.605 --> 29:44.409
I felt negative vibes
with your angry boyfriend.

29:44.543 --> 29:46.946
He's a bodyguard.
He's not angry.

30:04.429 --> 30:09.234
It's
nothing personal.

30:09.367 --> 30:10.635
Just tell my husband that

30:10.769 --> 30:13.805
this is what I do to
his private detectives.

30:19.644 --> 30:22.215
I'll leave
you guys the check.

30:22.347 --> 30:23.950
No rush.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.917
Are you okay, Dennis?

30:26.052 --> 30:28.553
I'll take
care of it, honey.

30:37.029 --> 30:41.533
I told you... you
needed a bad habit.

31:34.386 --> 31:35.320
You like that?

31:37.223 --> 31:39.558
Stop! Stop, please!

31:39.691 --> 31:40.692
Do you want it again?
Do you?

31:42.327 --> 31:43.695
You want it again?

31:43.829 --> 31:45.097
Yeah! hit him!

31:52.904 --> 31:54.639
Tell her to not beat my boy!

31:54.773 --> 31:57.210
Please tell her
not to beat my boy!

32:10.056 --> 32:12.058
Oh.

32:12.191 --> 32:16.528
Long gone are the days when you
looked like a truck stop hooker!

32:16.661 --> 32:19.364
It's Melody herself!

32:19.497 --> 32:22.335
Or should I call you Christa?

32:22.467 --> 32:24.870
Or maybe Bambi?

32:25.004 --> 32:28.107
I forget how the fuck
you like to be named.

32:34.146 --> 32:38.450
Oh, merci.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.419
C'est bien.

32:41.553 --> 32:44.190
I meant what I
said the other day.

32:44.323 --> 32:47.559
I expect you to keep
your promise as well.

32:47.692 --> 32:49.061
Where is she?
Where's my sister?

32:49.195 --> 32:53.266
Everyone is talking word
on the street about you.

32:53.398 --> 32:55.500
Ze renegade.

32:55.634 --> 32:57.869
And that's solid shit for me.

32:58.004 --> 32:59.972
Everyone is saying
you are leaving the city.

33:00.106 --> 33:02.174
I didn't come here to
talk shop with you, Vincent.

33:02.308 --> 33:04.977
This is just for my
sister to get out of here.

33:05.111 --> 33:07.280
She won't be a hooker
for the rest of her life.

33:07.412 --> 33:09.048
She's not a hooker!

33:10.682 --> 33:14.186
She was my partner.
She has run this place with me!

33:16.022 --> 33:18.690
What do you want for her, huh?

33:18.823 --> 33:21.193
To be a loose bitch like you?

33:21.327 --> 33:25.463
You think
you're squared up, hm?

33:27.599 --> 33:30.102
You're still a bitch...

33:30.236 --> 33:31.636
living in a gold cage.

33:31.770 --> 33:33.205
I don't care!
We have an agreement.

33:33.339 --> 33:36.208
She must come with me
even if she despises me!

33:36.342 --> 33:39.744
Okay, okay, all right.

33:39.878 --> 33:43.983
I keep my part of the deal.

33:57.462 --> 33:58.697
Don't move.

33:58.830 --> 34:00.865
He hates blondes.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.204
He'll break your
bones like crackers.

34:15.281 --> 34:17.248
Okay, where is she?

34:17.382 --> 34:19.516
Bring her now!

34:21.420 --> 34:23.554
Your sister was sick.

34:23.688 --> 34:25.590
Very sick.

34:25.724 --> 34:27.259
For over three weeks.

34:27.393 --> 34:30.695
I swear to god, I'm going
to expose you to the police

34:30.829 --> 34:32.931
if you don't bring me Lana now.

34:37.370 --> 34:40.005
Here lies your sister, Lana.

34:40.139 --> 34:44.976
And I am making my
delivery as I promised.

34:46.643 --> 34:49.514
Archangels' trumpets shall blow

34:49.647 --> 34:52.817
and souls to bodies
will join millions

34:52.952 --> 34:58.290
who will wish their lives below
were as short as thine,

34:58.424 --> 35:00.592
safe...

35:00.725 --> 35:05.398
from the corrupting
influences of the world.

35:06.898 --> 35:10.869
I am a man of my word.

35:11.003 --> 35:13.905
Take your sister with you.

35:17.776 --> 35:22.314
And keep bringing me
my money same as today.

35:22.448 --> 35:24.517
You don't want me
to expose your past

35:24.649 --> 35:28.054
to your rich friends, do you?

35:28.187 --> 35:30.356
Now go! Go away!

35:34.726 --> 35:36.495
You didn't help my boy!

36:40.326 --> 36:42.328
Come on, come on.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.363
You can't get sleepy now.

36:44.497 --> 36:46.232
Breathe, breathe.

36:46.365 --> 36:47.799
You gotta walk.

37:02.714 --> 37:05.783
- Are you okay?
- Where am I?

37:08.753 --> 37:11.190
It was a nightmare.

37:11.323 --> 37:13.526
That had to have
been a nightmare.

37:36.515 --> 37:39.251
Ah, I was stupid!

37:39.385 --> 37:42.021
I was so stupid!

37:42.154 --> 37:43.656
Lana...

37:43.788 --> 37:46.758
she's dead and there's nothing
I can do to bring her back.

37:50.930 --> 37:54.567
I... I tried getting her

37:54.699 --> 37:58.003
out of that kind of life.

37:58.137 --> 38:01.173
But she refused.
She hated me.

38:01.307 --> 38:04.176
All she wanted was to be
surrounded by those mean people

38:04.310 --> 38:07.580
at that nasty place
they call The Atelier.

38:07.712 --> 38:09.548
It's not even a whorehouse.

38:09.682 --> 38:11.650
It's a living hell.

38:11.783 --> 38:13.285
Who's Lana?

38:13.419 --> 38:15.853
My sister.

38:15.988 --> 38:19.158
A hooker... just like me.

38:22.428 --> 38:27.199
- I hate Vincent!
- Just... calm down.

38:27.333 --> 38:31.803
Is that the man
who runs the place?

38:31.937 --> 38:33.871
I'm sure he did
something to her.

38:34.974 --> 38:37.343
Someday he'll come after me.

38:37.476 --> 38:39.345
You gotta stay strong.

38:39.478 --> 38:43.415
Rest assured nothing is gonna
happen to you, Mrs. Crawford.

38:43.549 --> 38:45.584
Rebecca!

38:45.718 --> 38:47.386
Rebecca is my real name.

38:47.519 --> 38:48.954
It's my only name!

38:51.457 --> 38:55.027
Why do the outcasts suffer
more than everybody else?

38:57.029 --> 38:58.664
Who protects a hooker?

39:04.670 --> 39:05.803

paying us for doing nothing.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.006
It's ridiculous.

40:30.422 --> 40:31.824
Look at this.

40:31.957 --> 40:33.492
Come here.

40:35.728 --> 40:37.363
This is so cool.

40:40.865 --> 40:42.101
What's in there?

40:55.447 --> 40:59.485
I want my toys!
I want my toys!

40:59.618 --> 41:02.087
I want my toys!

41:02.221 --> 41:04.323
Woman, chill out.

41:08.926 --> 41:10.696
I feel sick.

41:10.829 --> 41:12.798
I lost my kitty.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.770
It was driving me mad.

41:17.902 --> 41:19.872
I was like...

41:20.005 --> 41:23.442
how could this be
happening to me?

41:23.575 --> 41:24.943
I looked everywhere.

41:25.077 --> 41:27.346
I saw nothing.

41:29.581 --> 41:35.254
Then I lifted my butt up
and had a warm sensation.

41:38.524 --> 41:41.660
And I found it!

41:45.964 --> 41:48.434
When are you
gonna cure me, Daddy?

41:48.567 --> 41:50.502
Help.

41:57.576 --> 41:59.678
Shh. Shh.

42:04.049 --> 42:06.585
It's okay.
I'll get you another cat.

42:16.762 --> 42:18.397
She's harmless.

42:22.868 --> 42:25.939
My daughter's immune
system is attacking her.

42:26.071 --> 42:27.639
I brought you here
to entertain her.

42:27.773 --> 42:30.809
But first, I have to make
sure you're healthy girls.

42:30.944 --> 42:35.214
So I'm going to give you
a couple of health tests.

42:35.347 --> 42:37.983
I want you to wait in
the room next door.

42:38.116 --> 42:39.885
I feel okay.

42:40.018 --> 42:41.720
Please.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.597
Onacona, I'm gonna check you.

42:51.730 --> 42:53.365
So be a good girl.

42:57.035 --> 42:59.004
Foot up, please.

43:03.008 --> 43:04.543
Okay.

43:08.614 --> 43:09.815
Oh.

43:09.949 --> 43:11.683
It's normal to have all
the swelling and bruising.

43:11.817 --> 43:15.621
And the blood along
the stitches is normal.

43:15.754 --> 43:17.489
It's healing.

43:17.623 --> 43:20.325
And you're gonna
do a lot better.

43:20.459 --> 43:23.161
Those sweet young girls
that you just met,

43:23.295 --> 43:25.297
they're going to help us.

43:25.430 --> 43:30.135
They were kind enough to donate
their skin to your cause.

43:33.805 --> 43:36.775
And daddy will get you
another kitten, okay?

43:44.716 --> 43:48.053
Hey, do you wanna
get laid now or what?

43:48.186 --> 43:49.788
Don't grab me like that.

43:49.922 --> 43:51.623
Hey, stop!

43:51.757 --> 43:53.026
Get off of me!

43:53.158 --> 43:54.192
- Aah!
- THE CRADLE:

44:51.050 --> 44:53.819
I don't
expect any less from you.

45:41.067 --> 45:43.735
I'm here to guide you.

45:43.869 --> 45:47.773
My mission is to make sure that
both get to the Spirit World

45:47.906 --> 45:49.541
in a peaceful way.

45:53.445 --> 45:55.814
Sleep well.

45:55.948 --> 45:59.685
You'll be newborns again.

45:59.818 --> 46:01.520
I am your cradle.

48:24.896 --> 48:26.531
No! Stop!

48:28.667 --> 48:29.868
You shouldn't shout like that

48:30.002 --> 48:32.604
when someone's
near the edge of a cliff.

48:35.407 --> 48:37.709
Tony, are you afraid of dying?

48:37.843 --> 48:39.045
No.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.914
But I do my best to avoid it.

48:43.049 --> 48:46.418
You don't trust me.
I know that.

48:46.551 --> 48:49.721
Why don't we go
back to the car?

48:49.855 --> 48:51.290
You'll have to walk my dog

48:51.423 --> 48:54.426
and help me shop at the farmers'
market, I warned you.

49:15.914 --> 49:17.950
What happened to your neck?

49:20.886 --> 49:22.955
You mean the spots on my skin.

49:23.089 --> 49:26.758
Every week, there was a client
that used to visit Vincent.

49:26.892 --> 49:30.762
This man would pick
one of us at random.

49:33.531 --> 49:35.034
And one night, it was my turn.

49:35.167 --> 49:37.435
I let him put a needle in me,
thought it was dope.

49:37.569 --> 49:40.672
He ran out of it
and went to get more.

49:40.805 --> 49:43.842
I remember I saw
myself in the mirror.

49:43.976 --> 49:46.379
And I noticed...

49:46.511 --> 49:49.315
several bleached spots
on my skins.

49:49.447 --> 49:51.117
Where exactly is The Atelier?

49:52.285 --> 49:53.585
I want to meet that man

49:53.718 --> 49:56.055
and find out what really
happened to your sister.

49:56.188 --> 49:57.722
It's too late for that.

50:01.193 --> 50:02.995
You see, you don't know
what it feels like

50:03.129 --> 50:05.730
making a mistake
that you regret forever.

50:08.267 --> 50:09.768
When I was 12...

50:15.174 --> 50:19.078
...my mother...

50:19.211 --> 50:21.913
she was murdered.

50:22.048 --> 50:27.119
And my sister... she was
taken away because of me.

50:30.189 --> 50:34.559
I do know about regrets.

50:34.693 --> 50:37.229
It happened a long time ago.

50:37.363 --> 50:39.597
And I never saw her again.

50:39.731 --> 50:43.202
But I won't give up
until I find her,

50:43.336 --> 50:46.405
in this or the next life.

50:46.538 --> 50:48.074
Don't lose hope.

50:54.813 --> 50:57.083
I wish I had known you before.

50:58.184 --> 50:59.584
You shouldn't
whisper like that

50:59.718 --> 51:01.454
when someone is
near the edge of a cliff.

51:21.240 --> 51:24.076
If you think introducing
me to my wife was a favor,

51:24.210 --> 51:26.445
you're wrong.

51:26.578 --> 51:29.281
Get in here,
let's make this fast.

51:32.318 --> 51:35.421
This is the damn holy grail
we've been looking for.

51:35.553 --> 51:37.089
Hydroquinone.

51:37.223 --> 51:39.291
It's a bleaching drug.

51:39.425 --> 51:40.892
Harmless in small quantities,

51:41.027 --> 51:46.032
but deadly when
highly concentrated.

51:46.165 --> 51:49.301
I mean, the quantity that... that
monster needs to do something

51:49.435 --> 51:52.038
like this must be humongous.

51:52.171 --> 51:54.140
Look at her face.

51:54.273 --> 51:56.641
That's the real
color of her skin.

51:57.675 --> 51:59.178
That changed
back to normal.

51:59.311 --> 52:01.280
The effect was temporary,
but the damage is permanent.

52:01.414 --> 52:05.617
These... these black spots
popped up as a consequence.

52:07.486 --> 52:08.620
Look at this.

52:13.658 --> 52:18.630
See, this foam made us
think it was only the fentanyl.

52:18.763 --> 52:21.200
He drugs them
with the opioid

52:21.333 --> 52:23.902
and bleaches their skin
afterwards.

52:34.413 --> 52:36.348
We should
build a treehouse one day.

52:36.482 --> 52:37.816
That sounds great.

52:37.950 --> 52:40.752
We'll use these trunks
to slide from above.

52:40.885 --> 52:42.687
Do you think
this is a good idea?

52:42.821 --> 52:44.923
What?
Making a treehouse?

52:45.057 --> 52:46.992
No, what we came here for.

52:47.126 --> 52:48.593
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

52:48.726 --> 52:50.062
That's our escape route.

52:50.196 --> 52:54.467
Don't worry,
they won't follow us.

52:54.599 --> 52:56.102
Oh, wow, we better leave, Ana.

52:56.235 --> 52:58.070
We'll grab a piece
of honeycomb and flee.

52:58.204 --> 53:00.539
- Understood? Do it!
- Okay.

53:02.274 --> 53:03.675
- Come on, Tony, run!
- Ow!

53:03.808 --> 53:06.212
Move, Tony!
Move, move, Tony! Move!

53:08.314 --> 53:10.815
- Help me!
- Hold my hand!

53:10.950 --> 53:13.385
Hold my hand!

53:15.988 --> 53:20.392
Oh, she had rough, but
beautiful hands, Bobby.

53:26.565 --> 53:28.200
Thanks.

53:28.334 --> 53:30.402
Don't thank me.

53:30.536 --> 53:32.271
Just do your job.

53:35.241 --> 53:37.243
I could prepare
a bleaching cream using

53:37.376 --> 53:41.547
hydroquinone for
age spots, like this.

53:43.182 --> 53:44.483
As a matter of fact,
any experienced pharmacist

53:44.617 --> 53:45.951
could do it, Tony.

53:46.085 --> 53:47.987
But, pay attention.

53:48.120 --> 53:51.490
I wouldn't use more than
an 8% concentration level,

53:51.624 --> 53:54.193
which is enough to make you
look like Michael Jackson.

53:57.096 --> 53:59.331
Let me see what you
brought me this time.

54:24.323 --> 54:25.591
This is the highest
concentration

54:25.723 --> 54:27.359
I've seen in my life.

54:29.094 --> 54:31.796
If he was to use a
cream on somebody...

54:31.931 --> 54:34.400
- What if it's not a cream?
- What?

54:34.533 --> 54:37.403
What if it's
taken intravenously?

54:37.536 --> 54:39.171
Are you serious?

54:39.305 --> 54:42.840
It would be a death sentence.

54:42.975 --> 54:45.578
My supplier, a
pharmaceutical company,

54:45.710 --> 54:49.448
is the only place you can
buy it in big quantities.

54:49.582 --> 54:50.848
And they wouldn't sell it

54:50.983 --> 54:52.750
to just any John Doe
with a checkbook.

54:52.884 --> 54:54.420
- Linda?
- What?

54:54.553 --> 54:57.289
Could you please get me a
list of all their customers?

54:57.423 --> 55:00.192
I don't know if I can.

55:00.326 --> 55:02.760
- I... I would have to check.
- I need it.

55:02.894 --> 55:04.063
Please, you have to.

55:04.196 --> 55:07.600
- I'll do what I can...
- Hold on.

55:07.732 --> 55:09.668
Where are you heading now?

55:10.735 --> 55:12.071
Damn it!

55:29.555 --> 55:31.323
Wake up, Vincent.

55:47.306 --> 55:51.577
I guess you rich people don't
let your debts go delinquent,

55:51.710 --> 55:53.145
do you?

55:54.313 --> 55:57.915
By the way,
I'm sorry about the other day.

56:02.621 --> 56:04.889
What is this shit?

56:08.460 --> 56:11.863
Fucking cocksucker
bitch, what did you do?

56:13.999 --> 56:16.101
I'll fucking end you, bitch.

56:18.671 --> 56:19.738
No, no, no!

56:22.675 --> 56:23.709
Let me go!

56:23.841 --> 56:25.077
No!

56:28.781 --> 56:32.884
Let me go! Let me go!

56:40.092 --> 56:42.695
Tie this bitch to the table...

56:44.630 --> 56:46.898
...and bring me the chainsaw.

56:47.032 --> 56:50.002
Let me go!

56:50.135 --> 56:52.805
Oh!

56:56.041 --> 56:58.377
I'm looking for
a man with one ear.

56:58.510 --> 57:00.612
- And I think you know him.
- Ah!

57:00.746 --> 57:03.482
Can't you see we all
have ears on our heads?

57:04.783 --> 57:05.984
No!
No, no! No, no!

57:06.118 --> 57:08.287
He's just,
uh... another customer.

57:08.420 --> 57:11.889
He... a buyer!
He pays a lot for my bitches!

57:12.024 --> 57:14.360
You're a scumbag.

57:14.493 --> 57:17.862
You supplied that man with the
girls and he slaughtered them.

57:17.996 --> 57:20.366
Don't blame me.

57:20.499 --> 57:24.303
Her... her sister, she
delivered the bitches.

57:24.436 --> 57:25.204
Let her go.

57:25.337 --> 57:27.606
Oh, oh wait, I... I...

57:29.108 --> 57:32.311
You're looking for
the... the lot lizard.

57:49.128 --> 57:51.697
- Let me go!
- Come on! Come on!

57:55.501 --> 57:58.370
Don't thank me!
Don't thank me!

58:07.912 --> 58:09.281
Bitch!

59:38.670 --> 59:42.708
This is a kalanchoe, my
grandpa's favorite flower.

59:42.841 --> 59:45.077
It means "never dies."

59:45.210 --> 59:46.345
And they can survive a drought

59:46.478 --> 59:48.080
in case you forget
to water them.

59:48.213 --> 59:52.084
I remember he gave me a
kalanchoe bouquet once.

59:52.217 --> 59:54.353
It was on my 16th birthday.

59:54.486 --> 59:57.957
He made me repeat the name over
and over so I could learn it,

59:58.090 --> 59:59.591
and so will you.

59:59.725 --> 01:00:00.859
Kalanchoe.

01:00:00.994 --> 01:00:02.561
Grandpa taught me that.

01:00:02.694 --> 01:00:06.865
It symbolizes the faith that
we must have in the afterlife,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.902
as it is eternal and beautiful.

01:00:10.035 --> 01:00:12.005
We never die.

01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:15.407
We just... continue our path.

01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:17.342
He kept repeating the name
of this flower over and over

01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:21.280
every day that he was certain
he would pass away.

01:00:21.413 --> 01:00:23.916
It strengthened his faith.

01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:25.183
Kalanchoe.

01:00:28.053 --> 01:00:31.156
Oh, there you are.

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:33.825
Hey... yeah.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.029
Where did you get these?

01:00:36.161 --> 01:00:38.564
You are persistent.

01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:44.236
The child who became an
FBI agent just to find me.

01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:46.204
All your career,
you've been obsessed with

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:48.907
chasing human traffickers.

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:54.880
Oh, you got the awards and
medals for putting pimps,

01:00:55.014 --> 01:00:59.551
rapists, sex offenders
into the deepest shit.

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:04.890
You know, the paradox is...

01:01:05.024 --> 01:01:09.294
you're gonna wind up
literally eating shit.

01:01:09.428 --> 01:01:12.397
And for what?

01:01:12.531 --> 01:01:15.267
You're fighting
for a lost cause.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.036
It'll never stop.

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:24.643
And by the way...

01:01:24.776 --> 01:01:28.213
don't bother looking
for your crazy sister,

01:01:28.347 --> 01:01:31.383
because you ran away
and left her behind.

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:45.464
Mister?

01:01:45.597 --> 01:01:47.899
Mister, I can't walk.

01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:49.601
You must help me.

01:01:49.735 --> 01:01:51.837
You must take me
to the hospital!

01:01:54.007 --> 01:01:57.242
Mister?

01:01:57.376 --> 01:01:58.945
You must help me.

01:01:59.078 --> 01:02:03.882
All the times I've turned a
blind eye for all the bitches

01:02:04.017 --> 01:02:05.952
you took from here!

01:02:06.085 --> 01:02:08.487
You must help me now!

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:17.063
Oh, oh, oh, merci. Merci.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.635
Merci beaucoup.

01:02:33.211 --> 01:02:35.048
Get out before he comes back!

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:49.795
He's gone. Leave!

01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:02.340
Where can I find him?

01:03:02.474 --> 01:03:05.111
Come on, take me to him.

01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:06.678
What's his real name?

01:03:06.812 --> 01:03:07.980
Tell me.

01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:10.983
Let's go.

01:03:15.454 --> 01:03:17.255
I hope you live a good life.

01:03:18.124 --> 01:03:20.392
Linda!

01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:21.727
Open the door!

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.795
- Oh my god, are you all...
- It's me!

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.701
Tell me that you got the list.

01:03:29.835 --> 01:03:31.403
I think we should
look at that cut.

01:03:31.536 --> 01:03:34.806
- Just tell me if you've got it!
- Yes!

01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:36.842
And I'm not giving you
the freaking list

01:03:36.976 --> 01:03:39.711
until you go upstairs,
take a shower,

01:03:39.845 --> 01:03:41.948
and let me take care
of your face.

01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:44.850
It's gonna get infected!

01:03:44.984 --> 01:03:46.251
Go!

01:03:46.384 --> 01:03:48.587
Oh.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.822
My friend confirmed that
they only sell hydroquinone

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:53.960
to pharmacies and
licensed dermatologists.

01:03:58.897 --> 01:04:01.299
This is endless.

01:04:01.433 --> 01:04:03.502
It's gonna take too long.

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:05.670
Can't finish this here.

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.989
I'm glad to see you again.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.727
You may have the day off.

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:41.306
You have become
very fond of him.

01:04:43.075 --> 01:04:45.310
Ask him to pick me
up tonight at 9:00.

01:04:45.443 --> 01:04:47.146
Da.

01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:02.661
I'll be right back.
Have a drink.

01:05:27.786 --> 01:05:30.555
I know what you think.

01:05:30.689 --> 01:05:33.226
I bitch about these
places and here I am.

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:45.437
I needed this.

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:47.340
I was a nervous wreck.

01:05:47.472 --> 01:05:50.542
I guess some skills are
impossible to forget, huh?

01:05:50.675 --> 01:05:52.777
Hey! Don't touch.

01:05:55.948 --> 01:05:59.384
I forgot to bring
you any small bills.

01:05:59.517 --> 01:06:02.955
That's a pity.

01:06:03.089 --> 01:06:04.890
No touching!

01:06:10.997 --> 01:06:13.165
You know I had to run away
from that place, don't you?

01:06:18.204 --> 01:06:19.804
I freaked the fuck out.

01:06:21.606 --> 01:06:23.508
I couldn't think.

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:29.414
Sorry if they hurt you.

01:06:32.884 --> 01:06:34.954
Can you forgive me?

01:06:36.821 --> 01:06:38.291
Is that the begging pose?

01:06:51.603 --> 01:06:53.005
Why did we come here?

01:06:53.139 --> 01:06:56.175
I don't understand.

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:59.544
I told you, I felt shitty.

01:06:59.678 --> 01:07:01.513
The stress is draining me.

01:07:08.354 --> 01:07:12.024
Promise me you won't make
me talk about my past anymore.

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:13.658
I promise.

01:07:14.859 --> 01:07:16.628
They hit you bad.

01:07:18.297 --> 01:07:20.132
Let me take care of you tonight.

01:07:33.578 --> 01:07:34.879
Ten-ninety-seven

01:07:35.014 --> 01:07:36.415
at Three-Thousand One
School Canyon Road.

01:07:36.548 --> 01:07:37.916
PC one-eight-seven.

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:39.818
Approach from
your 10 o'clock in 2 miles.

01:07:39.952 --> 01:07:41.220
Roger.

01:07:45.557 --> 01:07:47.859
The details
of what police say probably took

01:07:47.994 --> 01:07:52.098
place inside this dumpster are
almost too gruesome to share.

01:07:52.231 --> 01:07:56.435
The body of an 18-year-girl with
about 90% of her skin covered...

01:07:56.568 --> 01:07:59.472
For Pete's sake, we're not a
bunch of gray-haired respected

01:07:59.604 --> 01:08:02.208
experts talking
behind the podium.

01:08:02.341 --> 01:08:04.977
If the fucking weather only
gives us time for documentation

01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:07.512
or collection,
the choice is clear.

01:08:07.645 --> 01:08:09.015
Can we get
some more markers here?

01:08:09.148 --> 01:08:11.083
Oh fuck, a cloud's rolling in.
Excuse me.

01:08:13.085 --> 01:08:15.021
Almost done here.

01:08:15.154 --> 01:08:16.621
Cruz?

01:08:16.755 --> 01:08:19.425
What an unpleasant surprise.

01:08:19.557 --> 01:08:21.658
Were you all stoved up?

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:23.728
You wanna get back
in shape, come with me.

01:08:36.674 --> 01:08:38.243
Go ahead, look at her.

01:08:40.379 --> 01:08:43.715
There are no second chances
in this life, Tony boy.

01:08:43.848 --> 01:08:45.850
You might've
oughta think about that.

01:08:50.221 --> 01:08:53.225
You could've saved her
that night at the brothel.

01:08:55.094 --> 01:08:58.330
I hope you don't
ever forget her name:

01:08:58.464 --> 01:09:00.933
Diane Lorne.

01:09:01.067 --> 01:09:04.868
Another country girl
looking for El Dorado.

01:09:05.004 --> 01:09:06.837
And what a vicious circle, too.

01:09:06.971 --> 01:09:08.840
When they ain't got
a pot to piss in,

01:09:08.974 --> 01:09:12.511
they always wind up
taking the trashy jobs.

01:09:12.644 --> 01:09:14.380
Maybe it wasn't her choice.

01:09:17.816 --> 01:09:20.953
Wearing that thing
was humiliating!

01:09:21.087 --> 01:09:24.223
Don't get sassy with me, Cruz.
I am plumb tuckered out.

01:09:24.356 --> 01:09:26.624
And I don't need your face
to remind me of

01:09:26.758 --> 01:09:29.361
how fucked up the world is.

01:09:29.495 --> 01:09:31.863
I had a promotion coming my way

01:09:31.997 --> 01:09:35.201
and you messed it up
that night at the brothel.

01:09:35.334 --> 01:09:38.304
So as far as I'm concerned,
you can vegetate in the asylum.

01:09:38.437 --> 01:09:41.840
You don't work with us anymore,
so get the fuck out of here.

01:09:42.907 --> 01:09:45.310
And you vultures back off.

01:09:45.444 --> 01:09:46.644
No more feeding!

01:10:13.973 --> 01:10:16.142
Mr. Lorne has
agreed to meet you.

01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:22.248
You said you've come to talk
about his daughter, Diane.

01:10:22.381 --> 01:10:23.748
Yeah.

01:10:23.882 --> 01:10:25.717
It better be important.

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:29.021
The man got Parkinson's
about three years ago.

01:10:29.155 --> 01:10:30.722
I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.

01:10:30.855 --> 01:10:33.626
He easily loses his temper.

01:10:33.758 --> 01:10:35.727
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:10:41.066 --> 01:10:42.734
Are you a reporter?

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:47.039
I hate reporters.

01:10:47.173 --> 01:10:48.440
No, sir.

01:10:50.075 --> 01:10:52.810
Is your daughter Diane Lorne?

01:10:52.945 --> 01:10:54.812
Yes, yes.

01:10:56.915 --> 01:10:59.218
When was the
last time you saw her?

01:10:59.351 --> 01:11:00.419
What?

01:11:00.553 --> 01:11:03.055
When was the last
time you saw her?

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:04.590
Oh
yes, two days ago.

01:11:04.722 --> 01:11:08.460
She packed up her
things and left.

01:11:08.594 --> 01:11:11.063
Was she involved with
someone when she left?

01:11:16.101 --> 01:11:18.037
Can I take a look
at her bedroom?

01:11:25.978 --> 01:11:27.812
What are you waiting for?

01:11:30.216 --> 01:11:32.784
Get out
before he comes back!

01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:34.752
Are you okay, sir?

01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:40.459
Let me show you something.

01:11:47.366 --> 01:11:49.535
We... we don't know
what they mean.

01:11:49.668 --> 01:11:53.606
And look at all this
writing on the walls.

01:11:53.738 --> 01:11:55.341
She wrote all of it.

01:11:55.474 --> 01:11:57.376
It's Cherokee.

01:11:57.509 --> 01:11:59.345
These are love letters.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.023
Well, a year ago,
her best friend

01:12:11.156 --> 01:12:14.260
ran into Diane on a city bus.

01:12:14.393 --> 01:12:18.530
Apparently she...
she seemed happy.

01:12:18.664 --> 01:12:20.666
She was in love with an old man.

01:12:20.798 --> 01:12:22.368
At least, that's
what she told her.

01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:26.238
And that's the last
thing we knew of her.

01:12:26.372 --> 01:12:28.274
Do you know what that
man did for a living?

01:12:28.407 --> 01:12:29.841
No!

01:12:31.277 --> 01:12:36.949
My sweet child... was the
smartest student of 'em all.

01:12:37.082 --> 01:12:40.719
This is a Presidential Medal.

01:12:40.852 --> 01:12:42.254
It's hers.

01:12:42.388 --> 01:12:46.392
Only a handful of
students get this.

01:12:48.594 --> 01:12:51.930
I just... I just...

01:12:52.064 --> 01:12:53.532
want her to be happy.

01:12:55.768 --> 01:12:58.604
Can you help us to find her?

01:12:58.737 --> 01:13:01.640
Mr. Lorne...

01:13:01.774 --> 01:13:04.510
I'm afraid...

01:13:04.643 --> 01:13:07.879
your daughter, she
won't be coming back.

01:13:10.349 --> 01:13:13.818
Her body was found
a few hours ago.

01:13:15.654 --> 01:13:17.189
Someone should arrive
soon to inform you about it.

01:13:17.323 --> 01:13:18.557
You're probably gonna hear

01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:20.459
a lot of things
about her you won't like.

01:13:26.565 --> 01:13:29.201
I want you to know...

01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:33.138
that I met your daughter.

01:13:33.272 --> 01:13:38.477
In fact, I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't for her.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.750
She saved my life.

01:13:44.882 --> 01:13:46.819
But I couldn't save hers.

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:52.157
I couldn't save her.

01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:57.963
I should have listened to
my gut when I saw you outside.

01:13:58.097 --> 01:14:00.265
Where is my daughter?

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:02.534
Her body will be
at the county morgue.

01:14:02.668 --> 01:14:06.939
An agent will be here very
soon to give you the details.

01:14:07.072 --> 01:14:08.774
Oh lord!

01:14:08.906 --> 01:14:09.808
I'm sorry.

01:14:09.942 --> 01:14:11.876
Oh lord!

01:14:29.228 --> 01:14:32.097
Dude, you look like crap, man!

01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.233
When was the
last time you slept?

01:14:34.366 --> 01:14:36.268
Look, I can't leave you
alone for five freaking...

01:14:36.402 --> 01:14:38.903
Let's see if the city issued
any parking tickets between

01:14:39.037 --> 01:14:42.374
10:00 and 11:00 that night.

01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:45.010
I want to check all the plates
and credit cards registered

01:14:45.144 --> 01:14:47.112
in this machine that night.

01:14:47.246 --> 01:14:49.248
We did that already!
We got nothing!

01:14:49.381 --> 01:14:51.016
We'll check them again!

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:52.317
One by one!

01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:55.287
Credit cards,
plates, everything!

01:14:57.222 --> 01:14:59.057
Go talk to Uber, Lyft.

01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:00.359
Maybe he didn't drive.

01:15:02.661 --> 01:15:03.796
Tony, we're gonna...

01:15:03.928 --> 01:15:05.964
He can't hurt
those girls anymore.

01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:12.404
I promise you.

01:15:12.538 --> 01:15:14.473
Trust me, we're gonna get him.

01:15:21.547 --> 01:15:24.316
She's a peaceful
girl and she needs company,

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:28.554
so talk to her and,
uh, entertain her.

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:04.089
Hey!

01:16:05.891 --> 01:16:09.928
You need a charger for that.

01:16:10.062 --> 01:16:12.297
I have one.
You want one?

01:16:27.779 --> 01:16:28.948
Here, take it!

01:16:36.288 --> 01:16:37.991
Will you let me pray?!

01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:52.204
Whose fault was it?

01:16:52.337 --> 01:16:57.376
I want
to leave this place!

01:16:57.509 --> 01:16:59.444
I want to leave this place!

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:03.482
I want to leave this place!

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.421
Surprise!

01:17:09.555 --> 01:17:14.192
It was you and all
the white people.

01:17:14.326 --> 01:17:15.594
Yeah.

01:17:15.727 --> 01:17:17.162
You're to blame.

01:17:17.296 --> 01:17:20.934
50 pounds sterling to slaughter

01:17:21.066 --> 01:17:23.135
and take scalps
of young Native men

01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:24.469
12 years of age and older!

01:17:24.603 --> 01:17:27.406
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:17:27.539 --> 01:17:30.108
And all that propaganda
back in the day, hm?

01:17:30.242 --> 01:17:32.210
Yes.

01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:34.246
Convince public opinion
in America

01:17:34.379 --> 01:17:38.917
that we started the practice.

01:17:39.052 --> 01:17:42.254
We were expunged from our land!

01:17:42.387 --> 01:17:43.855
We deserved extermination.

01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:45.490
Now, you look at her!

01:17:45.624 --> 01:17:49.461
You sprayed our land
with radiation

01:17:49.595 --> 01:17:52.631
to test your chemical warfare
technology.

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:55.969
No, Daddy, please
don't hurt her!

01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:57.937
Daddy, don't hurt her!

01:18:01.373 --> 01:18:04.376
We didn't do it for the money.

01:18:04.509 --> 01:18:07.846
We wanted the souls!

01:18:07.981 --> 01:18:09.748
Can you feel it?

01:18:12.751 --> 01:18:16.990
This room... is
packed with souls.

01:18:47.452 --> 01:18:50.155
One ticket was
issued that night.

01:18:50.288 --> 01:18:53.191
This is a list of all the
plates the machines spit out.

01:18:53.325 --> 01:18:55.394
We cross-referenced everything.

01:18:57.429 --> 01:18:59.598
There's a vintage car.

01:18:59.731 --> 01:19:01.633
- I'll check this one.
- Okay.

01:19:03.568 --> 01:19:05.038
Now look at this.

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:08.941
They buy huge quantities
of hydroquinone every week.

01:19:09.075 --> 01:19:11.044
Check the front door.

01:19:11.176 --> 01:19:12.744
What do you see there?

01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:15.881
Is it a shield?
A... a... a drawing?

01:19:16.015 --> 01:19:18.750
I don't know.
Maybe a bir... is it a bird?

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:20.552
It's an owl.

01:19:20.686 --> 01:19:23.956
Maybe it's nothing, but an
owl means death in Cherokee.

01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.190
Come on, Tony,
my cousin Jemima

01:19:25.323 --> 01:19:26.558
has a parrot in her house.

01:19:26.692 --> 01:19:28.995
Doesn't mean she's a murderer.

01:19:29.128 --> 01:19:30.362
I'll handle it.

01:19:30.495 --> 01:19:31.863
Dude, all
right, come on, man.

01:19:31.998 --> 01:19:34.466
Relax. Just relax.
Let's fucking do this, bro.

01:19:34.599 --> 01:19:36.234
I'll get a team,
we'll go to the owl house,

01:19:36.368 --> 01:19:38.570
and we'll get it done.
And you?

01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:40.906
Just take
care of yourself, man.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.608
Next time I see you, I don't
want to see you looking like...

01:19:46.145 --> 01:19:47.446
You know what I mean.

01:19:50.016 --> 01:19:51.283
Now, come on.

01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:52.884
I'll let you know
what I find on the car.

01:19:53.019 --> 01:19:54.419
All right.

01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:19.244
Let's do this.

01:20:22.048 --> 01:20:23.415
What's up?

01:20:23.548 --> 01:20:24.916
I made it to
check up on the car.

01:20:25.051 --> 01:20:27.819
We at this
sons of bitch's place.

01:20:27.954 --> 01:20:31.590
- Ugh, and it smells like shit!
- What?

01:20:31.723 --> 01:20:33.325
He's not
here, but we IDed him.

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:36.229
The Cradle's real name
is Tikinagan Cook.

01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:39.531
62, Native American, loaded.

01:20:39.664 --> 01:20:41.566
We're sending his picture
to every law enforcement

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.568
and federal agency.

01:20:43.702 --> 01:20:46.538
And we found tons of
cases of hydroquinone.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:52.611
And a bunch of human scalps on
some type of Indian calendar

01:20:52.744 --> 01:20:56.882
with names by each of them, each
year marked by eight scalps.

01:20:57.016 --> 01:21:00.987
Wait, there's only
six on this one.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.555
So he's probably planning
for more victims.

01:21:03.688 --> 01:21:05.258
Rocco, can you
check if her name...

01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:07.160
Ana's name
is not on here.

01:21:07.292 --> 01:21:08.293
Tony, don't worry.

01:21:08.426 --> 01:21:09.594
- Rocco?
- What's up?

01:21:09.728 --> 01:21:10.762
I'm feeling a
little dizzy, man.

01:21:10.896 --> 01:21:12.731
- I'm gonna go outside.
- Okay.

01:21:15.634 --> 01:21:16.735
Hey, man, I gotta go.

01:21:19.105 --> 01:21:20.906
Stewart should
be here in a minute.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.008
Thanks, bro.

01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:23.341
You're a beast.

01:21:23.475 --> 01:21:25.577
We'll celebrate tomorrow,
all right?

01:21:28.047 --> 01:21:30.515
Ugh, it's nasty in here.

01:21:32.084 --> 01:21:35.121
Come on, don't be a pussy.
You okay?

01:21:36.922 --> 01:21:37.889
What the fuck?

01:23:22.261 --> 01:23:25.298
♪ O mio babbino... ♪

01:24:46.946 --> 01:24:49.315
Please, be quiet.

01:24:49.448 --> 01:24:51.283
I'm gonna help you.

01:25:57.983 --> 01:25:59.351
Hello.

01:26:00.519 --> 01:26:02.254
What's your name?

01:26:02.388 --> 01:26:04.223
I wanna help you.

01:26:13.032 --> 01:26:14.500
You're gonna be fine.

01:26:15.767 --> 01:26:17.203
Please, stop!

01:26:17.336 --> 01:26:19.305
Stop, stop, stop!

01:26:19.438 --> 01:26:20.772
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:26:22.074 --> 01:26:24.742
What's wrong with you?

01:26:24.876 --> 01:26:27.046
I want food.

01:26:31.616 --> 01:26:34.120
Take this.

01:26:37.655 --> 01:26:38.923
What happened to you?

01:26:39.058 --> 01:26:43.295
I mean... to your skin?

01:26:43.429 --> 01:26:45.397
My father knows.

01:26:45.531 --> 01:26:48.200
You know him?

01:26:48.334 --> 01:26:52.404
The skin falls off and he
stitches it back on again.

01:26:58.877 --> 01:27:00.479
Did you like it?

01:27:00.613 --> 01:27:03.182
I'll bring you more.

01:27:03.315 --> 01:27:05.451
Wait for me.

01:27:55.568 --> 01:27:57.436
Oh!

01:28:25.264 --> 01:28:27.266
You speak our language.

01:28:28.133 --> 01:28:33.339
I see... a tortured soul.

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:42.914
Today... we celebrate
the Sun Dance.

01:28:45.150 --> 01:28:49.154
I'll free your spirit...

01:28:49.288 --> 01:28:51.323
and release you
from your suffering.

01:28:51.457 --> 01:28:54.093
You're a disgrace
to your people.

01:28:54.226 --> 01:28:57.029
You've tortured those
girls for nothing.

01:28:57.162 --> 01:28:59.498
That woman in the other room,
she's dying!

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:56.989
The Ani-kutani taught us that...

01:29:57.122 --> 01:29:59.325
anyone who can stand the pain

01:29:59.458 --> 01:30:01.093
will come back from
the Spirit World

01:30:01.226 --> 01:30:04.463
and return to their
physical bodies again.

01:30:04.596 --> 01:30:07.800
But... since human
decomposition begins about,

01:30:07.933 --> 01:30:12.271
uh... four minutes after death...

01:30:12.404 --> 01:30:17.376
when you come back, your tissues
will be broken and the enzymes

01:30:17.509 --> 01:30:20.946
will have eaten your
cells from the inside out.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.582
And you'll wake up...

01:30:23.716 --> 01:30:26.652
with bacteria, worms,

01:30:26.785 --> 01:30:30.189
and insects inside a grave.

01:30:31.623 --> 01:30:33.759
What you said is true.

01:30:33.891 --> 01:30:37.763
My daughter... she has a disease

01:30:37.895 --> 01:30:39.565
that's consuming
her entire skin.

01:30:41.367 --> 01:30:43.135
And she is dying.

01:30:43.268 --> 01:30:46.572
All the skin transplants
I've made are just...

01:30:46.705 --> 01:30:48.340
just not working.

01:30:48.474 --> 01:30:51.977
The steroids aren't
protecting her anymore.

01:30:52.111 --> 01:30:54.413
They're just making
her gain weight.

01:30:57.116 --> 01:31:00.586
So I'm gonna try
once more with you.

01:31:06.358 --> 01:31:08.761
You're going to get cold

01:31:08.893 --> 01:31:11.230
and you're going to get dizzy.

01:31:13.699 --> 01:31:16.235
And your vision is probably
blurry by now, isn't it?

01:31:20.472 --> 01:31:25.444
And a strong odor
will exit your pores.

01:31:25.577 --> 01:31:27.413
Now, this is normal.

01:31:32.384 --> 01:31:35.220
Why do you look
at me so tenderly?

01:31:35.354 --> 01:31:37.189
You must be delusional.

01:31:37.322 --> 01:31:38.557
It's probably liver failure...

01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:40.459
...and you're about
to go into shock.

01:31:44.863 --> 01:31:45.931
Mom...

01:31:46.064 --> 01:31:48.267
Anything you wanna tell me?

01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:53.105
What are you doing...

01:31:53.238 --> 01:31:55.541
What are you doing here, Mom?

01:31:55.674 --> 01:32:00.012
Calvary man,
I think you'll be ready

01:32:00.145 --> 01:32:02.614
in just a few minutes.

01:32:02.748 --> 01:32:08.520
Mom... that woman
in the other room...

01:32:08.654 --> 01:32:10.422
What of her?

01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:14.893
Wolfsbane!

01:32:15.027 --> 01:32:17.930
I gave her a large
dose of wolfsbane,

01:32:18.063 --> 01:32:19.198
poison to end her misery!

01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:22.601
No!

01:32:37.649 --> 01:32:39.384
Huh?

01:32:39.518 --> 01:32:41.153
All right, I'm gonna have
to give you a laxative.

01:32:41.286 --> 01:32:42.754
No, I hate it!

01:32:42.888 --> 01:32:44.623
You've gotta get rid of
everything you've eaten!

01:32:44.756 --> 01:32:50.229
No, last time I
pooped myself 100 times!

01:32:50.362 --> 01:32:52.431
Well, then answer my question.

01:32:52.564 --> 01:32:56.869
Did someone come in here and
give you something, yes or no?

01:32:57.002 --> 01:32:58.637
There was a man.

01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:00.539
He gave me candy.

01:33:00.672 --> 01:33:03.709
Well, why did you eat it?
He's trying to kill you!

01:33:06.345 --> 01:33:07.813
Okay, okay, you're
gonna have to throw up

01:33:07.947 --> 01:33:09.615
everything in your stomach.

01:33:09.748 --> 01:33:11.083
No, no!

01:33:11.216 --> 01:33:13.218
- Yes!
- No, no!

01:33:51.256 --> 01:33:53.960
Onacona... get up.

01:33:54.092 --> 01:33:56.562
Please. Please.

01:34:02.768 --> 01:34:04.202
Where is she?

01:34:09.908 --> 01:34:13.679
Where is my sister?

01:34:13.812 --> 01:34:17.215
Your sister was crazy.

01:34:18.216 --> 01:34:21.820
Your sister was... crazy.

01:34:26.059 --> 01:34:30.729
She kept repeating that word...

01:34:30.862 --> 01:34:34.566
kalanchoe.

01:34:43.208 --> 01:34:44.876
Kalanchoe?

01:34:49.715 --> 01:34:51.483
No.

01:34:53.719 --> 01:34:55.887
Never dies.

01:35:28.587 --> 01:35:30.389
It's warm in here.

01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:33.191
You must be burning
up in that dress.

01:35:33.325 --> 01:35:34.826
Oh, should I change?

01:35:34.961 --> 01:35:38.830
Maybe you prefer my
pole dancing outfit.

01:35:38.965 --> 01:35:40.732
Not exactly.

01:35:40.866 --> 01:35:41.833
But you could say that.

01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:46.072
Hey, guys.

01:35:46.204 --> 01:35:49.142
Here, take this.

01:35:49.274 --> 01:35:50.742
It's your New Year's kit.

01:35:50.876 --> 01:35:52.310
I...

01:35:54.981 --> 01:35:55.914
I'm so sorry.

01:35:56.049 --> 01:35:57.349
No worries.

01:36:00.686 --> 01:36:01.620
So?

01:36:01.753 --> 01:36:03.056
Oh, jeez.
I'll be right back.

01:36:26.946 --> 01:36:31.150
Don't move.

01:36:31.283 --> 01:36:32.718
Gone from the world...

01:36:32.851 --> 01:36:33.919
No!

01:36:34.053 --> 01:36:35.520
No! Shh.

01:36:35.654 --> 01:36:36.521
Quiet!

01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:08.054
Lana?

01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.875
Your date?

01:37:31.743 --> 01:37:34.013
This is a decent place.

01:37:34.147 --> 01:37:39.451
I've been hiding from that woman
and the Frenchman for years.

01:37:39.584 --> 01:37:41.853
Do you know what a slave is?

01:37:48.593 --> 01:37:50.062
Here's your check.

01:37:50.196 --> 01:37:52.631
I hope I never see her again.

01:38:07.445 --> 01:38:09.414
I just got a phone call.

01:38:09.548 --> 01:38:11.383
I got good news for you.

01:38:14.187 --> 01:38:16.354
Do you remember... that day

01:38:16.488 --> 01:38:19.658
when you scattered
your sister's ashes?

01:38:19.791 --> 01:38:22.228
Do you remember when I asked
you to promise not to ask me

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.397
anything about my past?

01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:26.464
I prefer if we just...

01:38:26.598 --> 01:38:28.433
Not talking about her?

01:38:28.567 --> 01:38:31.037
Just bear with me.

01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:33.505
I kept the box your
sister's ashes were in

01:38:33.638 --> 01:38:36.943
- and ran a DNA test.
- You did what?!

01:38:37.076 --> 01:38:40.812
This guy confirmed they
weren't your sister's ashes.

01:38:40.947 --> 01:38:42.781
She's gotta be at The Atelier,

01:38:42.914 --> 01:38:44.951
and I wanna help you
get her out of there.

01:38:45.084 --> 01:38:46.285
We should go.

01:38:46.418 --> 01:38:48.054
Let's go.
Come on, come on, get up.

01:39:11.277 --> 01:39:13.411
Just keep going.

01:39:13.545 --> 01:39:14.779
I've had it.
I wanna leave.

01:39:14.913 --> 01:39:17.649
- She's not here.
- What makes you so sure?

01:39:18.717 --> 01:39:19.784
Do you know what
happened to her?

01:39:19.918 --> 01:39:21.586
No, why... why would I know?

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.388
I think you know where she is.

01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:26.125
What the fuck
you talking about?

01:39:26.259 --> 01:39:27.994
That's better.

01:39:28.127 --> 01:39:29.628
Much better.

01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:32.397
I prefer this version of you.

01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:34.399
It's a juicier role
to play, isn't it?

01:39:34.532 --> 01:39:36.434
I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:39:36.568 --> 01:39:38.470
Oh yeah, you do, Lana.

01:39:38.603 --> 01:39:41.307
You do understand.

01:39:41.439 --> 01:39:42.942
When did you switch places?

01:39:43.075 --> 01:39:45.477
Was it the night I
came here for her?

01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:46.946
Look at me.

01:39:47.079 --> 01:39:49.315
You can quit faking it.

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:56.888
You think you know
everything, don't you?

01:39:57.023 --> 01:40:00.692
But the truth is
you don't know shit.

01:40:00.825 --> 01:40:03.595
You don't know what it feels
like being fucked 70 times a day

01:40:03.728 --> 01:40:06.165
just because you have a
sister you have to protect.

01:40:06.299 --> 01:40:09.101
I took care of her.
I took all the bullets for her.

01:40:11.237 --> 01:40:13.239
It was so convenient
for that little worm,

01:40:13.372 --> 01:40:14.739
having me in her life.

01:40:14.873 --> 01:40:16.675
And how did she repay me?

01:40:16.808 --> 01:40:19.711
She left me alone.
I want to go.

01:40:19.844 --> 01:40:22.114
So that gave you the
right to lock her up here?

01:40:22.248 --> 01:40:24.883
You are gonna take me to
where she is right now.

01:40:32.191 --> 01:40:33.692
No.

01:40:36.494 --> 01:40:37.729
You didn't lock her up.

01:40:37.862 --> 01:40:40.299
I had to survive on my own!

01:40:40.433 --> 01:40:43.169
She should have stayed by my
side, but she buried me alive!

01:40:43.302 --> 01:40:45.237
So she didn't deserve
to live, did she?

01:40:45.371 --> 01:40:46.805
She was a selfish woman

01:40:46.939 --> 01:40:49.008
who thought she could buy me
with her stupid money.

01:40:51.444 --> 01:40:53.412
Please, Tony.

01:40:53.545 --> 01:40:55.348
Forget her.

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.549
Tell me...

01:40:57.682 --> 01:41:00.286
how was it with me
the other night?

01:41:00.419 --> 01:41:03.122
You can have as many nights
like that as you want.

01:41:03.255 --> 01:41:06.491
So she's not alive.

01:41:06.624 --> 01:41:08.727
You don't get it.

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:12.497
I had to survive on my own.

01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:13.598
Is she alive?!

01:41:13.732 --> 01:41:15.434
No, no, she's not, okay?!

01:41:15.567 --> 01:41:17.203
She had it comin'!

01:41:20.439 --> 01:41:22.074
Can we go now?

01:41:23.842 --> 01:41:26.845
You deliberately handed
the girls to The Cradle.

01:41:26.979 --> 01:41:29.181
You're gonna pay in jail
for what you've done.

01:41:30.349 --> 01:41:31.850
Fuck off!

01:41:37.289 --> 01:41:40.525
You trust too much
in people, Tony.

01:41:40.658 --> 01:41:42.428
That's your weakness.

01:41:54.306 --> 01:41:55.640
Have you seen my son?

01:41:55.774 --> 01:41:57.276
- Tell me!
- Don't touch me!

01:41:57.410 --> 01:42:00.212
Tell me! Tell me!

01:42:01.347 --> 01:42:03.482
Tell me! Tell me!

01:42:06.751 --> 01:42:08.254
Get out of my way!

01:42:11.723 --> 01:42:13.993
Let go! Let go!

01:42:14.126 --> 01:42:15.894
Get off me.

01:42:16.028 --> 01:42:18.464
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

01:42:18.596 --> 01:42:20.266
Aah!

01:44:06.505 --> 01:44:07.772
I'm sorry.

01:44:07.906 --> 01:44:09.575
I'm so sorry.

01:44:09.707 --> 01:44:11.676
Follow me.
We need to hurry.

01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:39.205
Stay here.

01:44:39.338 --> 01:44:40.772
Stay here!

01:45:14.573 --> 01:45:16.709
No, no, no, no!

01:45:16.841 --> 01:45:19.578
No, no!

01:45:19.712 --> 01:45:20.845
Mom!

01:45:24.049 --> 01:45:28.454
CRADLE AND THERESA:

01:45:43.068 --> 01:45:45.137
Kalanchoe, kalanchoe!

01:45:51.644 --> 01:45:53.245
Ana!

01:45:56.048 --> 01:45:57.449
Kalanchoe.

01:46:00.452 --> 01:46:02.755
No!

01:46:24.842 --> 01:46:27.179
Ana? Ana?

01:46:29.281 --> 01:46:31.517
Mom?

01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:34.520
Oh, god.

01:46:34.653 --> 01:46:36.555
Tony.

01:46:36.689 --> 01:46:38.123
Do you see?

01:46:38.257 --> 01:46:40.326
It wasn't your fault.

01:46:40.459 --> 01:46:42.027
Ana.

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:45.097
I didn't give you away.

01:46:45.230 --> 01:46:46.932
I always thought
that I was the one...

01:46:47.066 --> 01:46:48.600
Not anymore.

01:46:52.671 --> 01:46:56.975
Son... you have to go.

01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:59.144
You don't have much time left.

01:46:59.278 --> 01:47:01.814
But I wanna be here with you.

01:47:01.947 --> 01:47:03.482
People need you.

01:47:16.028 --> 01:47:20.499
Where are we now?
I'm scared, Mom.

01:47:20.632 --> 01:47:22.801
Don't be.

01:47:22.935 --> 01:47:26.572
Remember, Tony, we never die.

01:47:26.705 --> 01:47:29.007
We just continue our path.

01:47:29.141 --> 01:47:32.211
And you must continue yours.

01:47:38.584 --> 01:47:40.419
You can do it, Son.

01:49:36.168 --> 01:49:38.972
It's all right.

01:50:06.198 --> 01:50:07.699
You can move forward now.

01:50:12.804 --> 01:50:14.206
Cruz?

01:50:15.707 --> 01:50:19.044
Shame on me for being
a selfish prick.

01:50:19.177 --> 01:50:21.813
Fuck promotions
and all that shit.

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:24.650
I want to apologize to
you for the other day.

01:50:24.783 --> 01:50:28.287
You've been so devoted to
helping all those girls and...

01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:30.088
I know they're grateful, Cruz.

01:50:33.659 --> 01:50:35.827
Agent Cruz.

01:50:42.067 --> 01:50:45.504
Mr. Cruz, are you going
back to work for the FBI?

01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:00.609
