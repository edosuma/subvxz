WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:04.636
You're fired.
<i> Previously on</i> this is us...

00:04.638 --> 00:07.705
What?
I think it's time
we go at it alone for a while.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.041
You know? See what happens.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.509
This doesn't say "pause"
on my script.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.277
Well, it doesn't say "suck"
either, yet here we are.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.146
<i> I'm not cut out for theater.</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:16.949
You do that a lot--
doubt yourself.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.952
You're so busy making sure that
Kate's not eating too much...

00:19.954 --> 00:21.120
Kev, calm down.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.855
...and Randall's
not too adopted!

00:22.857 --> 00:25.824
I'm sorry. I should have been
there, and I'm gonna be there.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.793
<i> Do you think</i>
<i> that my son could play with</i>

00:27.795 --> 00:30.562
yours sometime after school?
Yeah.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.296
Every time I met a new
black person, I would

00:32.299 --> 00:34.867
<i> put a mark in this notebook,</i>

00:34.869 --> 00:36.402
and every time
i met a black man,

00:36.404 --> 00:40.472
I wondered if that man
could possibly be my father.

No, baby, you got to
finish your bananas first.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.940
<i> You want some banana? </i>
Kev, you want a little banana,
too?

01:14.942 --> 01:18.510
<i> Go in and see your daddy right</i>
<i> now, okay? You have some more.</i>

01:18.512 --> 01:20.245
Jack, I think we're
completely out of milk.
Yeah.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.680
He won't drink his juice.
Yeah, I'll, um...

01:21.682 --> 01:23.615
He just wants milk.
I'll bring some home.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.950
Do you want some
more apples? Come on.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.251
Come on. Here, do
you want to get out

01:26.253 --> 01:27.786
of your chair?
Yeah.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.121
All right. Come on.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.223
<i> Babe, a desk job?</i>

01:31.225 --> 01:32.624
<i> Bec, we need the money.</i>

01:32.626 --> 01:36.028
<i> You don't even own a tie.</i>

02:02.156 --> 02:04.056
So...

02:04.058 --> 02:05.491
Did you hear?

02:05.493 --> 02:07.292
Uh... yeah.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.961
Surprise birthday cake
for Sandra in the break room.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.230
You know, it's never,
it's never a surprise.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.564
Als... okay, also,

02:12.566 --> 02:14.166
I got promoted.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.068
Project manager.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.570
That's great, man. Hey.
Thanks.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.772
And I'm bringing you with me.

02:20.774 --> 02:24.143
Oh. Um...

02:24.145 --> 02:26.245
Thanks, but no.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.279
But thanks.
No?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.614
Keep this quiet,

02:28.616 --> 02:31.416
but I'm, uh, gonna go out
on my own.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.652
I want to start
my own thing.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.188
I know it's risky, but once
i get things up and running,

02:36.190 --> 02:38.357
I can spend more time
with my kids.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.360
All right, how 'bout this:
Why don't you, um,

02:41.362 --> 02:43.028
take till the end of the week,

02:43.030 --> 02:44.930
think about it.
I'm okay.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.265
Don't need to think.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.168
End of the week, okay? Huh?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.812
Hi!

03:00.814 --> 03:02.781
Daddy's home!
Hi!

03:02.783 --> 03:04.116
Hey!
Dad! Dad!

03:04.118 --> 03:05.517
Hi.
Dad!
Kev.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.885
Dad!
Hi. Hey, buddy.
Kev...

03:06.887 --> 03:08.687
I need to ask you a question...
One second.
Dad!

03:08.689 --> 03:11.056
Hey, look-look at the
progress you made, bud.
Watch this.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.959
I'm gonna help you out
after dinner, okay? Hi.
Hi, baby. Mwah.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.360
Dad!
Yeah.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.462
- We're getting ice cream!
- Ice cream!

03:17.464 --> 03:18.363
- Ice cream?
- I promised them.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.898
Ice cream? Ice cream?!

03:19.900 --> 03:21.800
None for me if you want

03:21.802 --> 03:23.902
to be able to pick me up again.
Please, you are tiny.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.371
 Right. Mm.
But ice cream must mean
that the kids'

03:26.373 --> 03:28.373
report cards came back
and they were good?
No.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.576
Actually, mostly b's
and c's. I caved.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.178
I don't know. Parenting
makes my cerebellum hurt.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.646
Sorry, your what?

03:34.648 --> 03:37.649
It's the part of my brain
that makes my emotions.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.219
I have been doing way too much
third grade science homework.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.353
Mm.

03:41.355 --> 03:45.557
But why don't you,
uh, look at that.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.726
Why does Randall's teacher
want to see us?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.196
I don't know.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.532
Hmm. Okay.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.024
oh.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.695
Hope you don't mind. Pianos get
forlorn if you don't play 'em.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.697
No, of course I don't mind.
Where'd you learn

04:25.699 --> 04:28.200
how to play like that?
My dad taught me.

04:28.202 --> 04:29.401
And his dad taught him.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.470
Dad, can you teach
us to play?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.272
Uh, I wish I could.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.375
Grandma and aunt Kate got all
the music talent in the family.

04:36.377 --> 04:37.809
Me? I was always all knuckles.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.211
Yeah, well,
your dad's

04:39.213 --> 04:40.746
got other skills.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.714
Me, I managed to squeak out
a couple of dollars

04:42.716 --> 04:44.416
on one of these back in the day.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.918
Mostly trumpet, mm.
Any gigs I could get.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.787
Will you speak
at my career day?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.555
Can grandpa speak
at my career day?

04:50.557 --> 04:52.057
I don't think so, baby.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.393
You're only allowed one speaker,
and I'm already signed up.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.761
I pick grandpa.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.963
He had a cool job.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.931
What are you saying, that
daddy doesn't have a cool job?

04:59.933 --> 05:04.303
But you guys love visiting
me at the office, right?

05:04.305 --> 05:07.472
I like spinning
in your chair.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.008
You kind of have
a boring job, dad.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.477
Trading commodity futures based
on long-term weather patterns

05:12.479 --> 05:14.279
is not boring, okay?

05:16.684 --> 05:20.585
Sorry, sort of fell asleep soon
as I heard the word "commodity."

05:20.587 --> 05:22.821
Ooh, Uncle Kevin,
can you speak at my career day?

05:22.823 --> 05:25.424
Daddy's doing career day!
End of discussion.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.993
And it's gonna be lit.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.597
That's not how
you use "lit," right?

05:32.599 --> 05:35.133
No.
No.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.935
Sorry, I don't understand.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.005
So you are saying
that Randall is gifted?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.273
But his grades are average.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.141
Are you sure
you tested him right?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.444
Jack, we know
how smart he is.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.279
Okay, so what's up
with his grades?

05:47.281 --> 05:49.881
M-maybe is
the-the teacher prejudiced?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.116
Jack.
No.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.517
When a child tests well

05:52.519 --> 05:54.453
but his grades
don't seem to reflect it,

05:54.455 --> 05:56.121
oftentimes,
he isn't being challenged

05:56.123 --> 05:57.522
at his school.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.293
And you maybe want to
consider other options.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.362
They have
wonderful programs

06:03.364 --> 06:05.497
for exceptional children
like Randall.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.531
Not gonna happen.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.900
Jack, please stop making me
say "Jack."

06:08.902 --> 06:11.870
Randall is one of the only
black kids at this school,

06:11.872 --> 06:13.572
but at least here he has
his brother and sister.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.307
I know.
What about them?

06:15.309 --> 06:17.075
I mean, can they go, too?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.678
Mr. Pearson, all due respect,

06:19.680 --> 06:21.980
Kevin and Kate wouldn't do well
in that school.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.549
You see, that's
where you're wrong.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.419
All of our children
are exceptional.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.889
Can I touch you?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.158
I just want to touch you
one more time.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.093
Just... one part of your body.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.162
Your hair.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.498
I want to wake up...

06:41.335 --> 06:43.502
I'm sorry, I...
I'm...

06:43.504 --> 06:45.837
I'm not... I'm sorry, can
we... can we just start over?

06:45.839 --> 06:48.907
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Kevin,
can I ask you something?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.376
Yeah.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.577
Why...

06:52.579 --> 06:54.579
Just try to help me
understand this.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.183
Wh-why, every time we
come to this scene,

06:58.185 --> 07:02.888
this-this pinnacle of grief,
which should rip--

07:02.890 --> 07:08.026
I mean, literally rip--
tears from the audience,

07:08.028 --> 07:11.263
why you summon up
all the emotion

07:11.265 --> 07:14.132
of a Google maps voice.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.137
Right. Uh...

07:19.139 --> 07:20.539
I don't know. May...

07:20.541 --> 07:22.707
- You know, maybe it's in the words.
- How would you know?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.709
You've never said them.
Uh, no,

07:24.711 --> 07:26.144
I think...
I think I'm saying 'em.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.913
No. I mean, yeah,
like, s-some.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.282
Kind of. But you're-you're
mostly paraphrasing.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.783
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Y-yeah.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.452
You see,
it's really simple.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.755
Olivia is Jessica,
your wife.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.124
Okay.
You are David.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.160
You loved her,

07:42.162 --> 07:44.062
but now she is dead.

07:44.064 --> 07:48.567
So you are grieving
the <i> loss</i> of her.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.970
There's no longer
any such thing as gravity.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.141
Have you ever lost anyone?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.442
Yes.

07:57.444 --> 07:58.743
Because I don't believe you.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.145
Well, you know, Ron,
it's not my job

08:00.147 --> 08:01.413
to make sure
you believe me.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.415
Oh, yes, yes, it is! It is!

08:03.417 --> 08:05.617
It is exactly your job!

08:05.619 --> 08:07.586
Do your job.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.753
What is she writing?

08:08.755 --> 08:09.754
What are you
writing?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.656
That's her suicide note.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.091
All right, all right, enough,

08:13.093 --> 08:13.992
okay?

08:13.994 --> 08:17.028
He'll get there.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.196
Okay.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.831
All right.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.933
10:00 A.M. Tuesday, everybody.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.336
Thank you.
It's a process.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.271
Just... let it go for now.

08:26.273 --> 08:29.207
Yeah.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.643
What are you
doing tomorrow?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.778
Oh. Uh, well, tomorrow
i was just gonna spend

08:33.780 --> 08:35.679
the entire day feeling
like a failure, but, uh...

08:35.682 --> 08:37.515
Come to a party with me.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.951
A party? What kind of party
we talking?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.453
I'll text you the address.
Yeah, okay. All right.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.227
There's no way in hell.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.130
This job better be worth it.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.331
See ya, world.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.233
It's been real.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.637
Oh, Jesus.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.141
You sure you're
all right?

09:03.143 --> 09:05.410
Oh. Yeah, I'm good.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.146
I'm good. Yeah. Yeah.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.814
I'm good.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.816
Uh, Mrs. rosenthal...

09:11.818 --> 09:12.751
Marin.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.220
Oh. Marin.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.756
I realize that my previous
employment with my brother

09:17.758 --> 09:19.991
might not be
directly applicable.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.661
However,
i am abnormally organized.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.329
And I'm basically
the not crazy version

09:24.331 --> 09:26.498
of Jack Nicholson
in <i> as good as it gets.</i>

09:26.500 --> 09:28.066
Oh, I love that movie. Oh.
Right?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.669
"You make me want
to be a better man."

09:30.671 --> 09:33.004
Oh! Sorry.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.406
I'm sorry,
you were saying...

09:34.408 --> 09:36.775
No. I-i have
grant writing experience,

09:36.777 --> 09:40.111
and I'm used to dealing with
Hollywood types, which I know

09:40.113 --> 09:42.180
are large contributors
to your foundation.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.583
And I know you're on the board
of stay in touch

09:44.585 --> 09:45.917
and the butterfly ball.
Mm-hmm.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.285
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.754
Um, Doug Kincaid,

09:49.756 --> 09:51.957
your boss before
your brother, was it?

09:51.959 --> 09:54.559
He speaks about you
in such glowing terms.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.294
Why did you quit his firm?

09:56.296 --> 09:59.698
Because I fell
in love with him,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.800
and it was not
a healthy situation.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.702
I like you, Kate.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.103
You're qualified,
you're smart,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.639
and I need someone
right now by my side.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.107
Now, it's not
assistant work.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.376
It's part event coordinator,
part development associate.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.111
I would be absolutely thrilled.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.481
But there is some personal
stuff you may have to do,

10:16.483 --> 10:17.916
an errand here or there,

10:17.918 --> 10:20.118
maybe drive my
daughter to and from?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.386
Yeah. Okay.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.221
Not much, so don't
worry about that.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.389
No, of course.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.224
Yeah.
So, do you want the gig?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.792
Wait, really?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.427
I'm so excited!
Oh!

10:29.429 --> 10:31.730
Well, I'm so excited!

10:31.732 --> 10:33.064
Oh, I wanted you
from the moment

10:33.066 --> 10:34.833
the toilet paper was
stuck to your head.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.235
Seriously, though,
whatever you need,

10:37.237 --> 10:39.070
I'm your girl.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.739
Oh, hey,

10:40.741 --> 10:43.508
this is my daughter.
Jemma, this is Kate.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.677
So, I see you picked
the fat one.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.316
Oh.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.595
weather derivatives
are tradable commodities

11:03.597 --> 11:05.830
that protect business owners

11:05.832 --> 11:09.000
from future changes
in the weather.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.369
It's like licking
a piece of pizza

11:11.371 --> 11:14.039
so that nobody
will eat it later.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.509
Now I'm thinking about pizza.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.512
Okay.
No, wait,
I'm sorry-- no, no, no, wait,

11:20.514 --> 11:22.614
I was gonna get it this time.
Look, how am i
supposed to inspire

11:22.616 --> 11:24.816
an auditorium full of strangers,
and my own wife and kids

11:24.818 --> 11:26.017
don't even understand
what I do?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.019
That's not true.
Really?

11:28.021 --> 11:30.689
What do I do?

11:30.691 --> 11:33.358
You trade weather.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.994
You trade commodities
based on weather patterns.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.395
And what does that mean?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.531
Oh, damn, Randall, I don't know.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.666
You swap lightning bolts
for thunder clouds?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.869
Look, I know what
your day is like.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.805
I know that you like
one of your partners

11:46.807 --> 11:48.373
and you hate the other one.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.842
I know that you're gonna
redesign your office furniture

11:50.844 --> 11:52.410
and that you might fire
your assistant

11:52.412 --> 11:54.379
because she says
"like" too much.
It's nonstop.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.082
Can I talk to you in depth
about weather patterns?

11:57.084 --> 11:58.650
No, I cannot.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.352
But I don't think you'd
want me to if I could, so...

12:01.354 --> 12:04.656
Hey, what's-what's this
really about?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.660
Maybe I was meant
to be a musician.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.328
I'm sorry, what now?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.830
Or an artist or a writer.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.665
Just think about it, Beth.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.767
There's this whole
genetic side of me

12:15.769 --> 12:17.569
that nobody even knew existed.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.206
I mean, William was a poet,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.208
an artist, a musician.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.744
You know, maybe I've had
an artistic side in me all along

12:25.746 --> 12:27.545
and nobody knew to empower it.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.180
You know, maybe
i wasn't meant to be

12:29.182 --> 12:31.082
a straight and narrow math geek

12:31.084 --> 12:32.584
destined to wear a
shirt and tie every day

12:32.586 --> 12:33.585
like my parents thought.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.619
Maybe I was meant to live

12:34.621 --> 12:36.387
a musician's life.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.624
On the road and playing clubs,
you know?

12:39.626 --> 12:43.361
All right, well, in this musical
fantasy version of yourself,

12:43.363 --> 12:45.196
what instrument would you...
Sax.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.098
Mm.
Like Wesley in <i> mo' better blues.</i>

12:47.100 --> 12:48.399
Definitely sax.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.768
Oh, yeah.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.102
That's sexy, yeah.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.437
You're making fun of me.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.439
No.
No, you're making fun of me.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.474
No, I am not. I'm-I'm not.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.277
Your biological father
just came back into your life,

12:59.279 --> 13:01.112
and it's bringing up
all kinds of stuff.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.814
It's-it's normal.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.482
Look,

13:04.484 --> 13:09.254
why don't you try out
this-this crazy artist side

13:09.256 --> 13:12.757
of yourself and, you know,
get this presentation popping.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.794
Let's see how it flies with
some eight-year-olds, right?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.395
Before you, like,
shift careers

13:17.397 --> 13:20.298
and start playing
open mic saxophone nights.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.800
You know, maybe I will.
Okay, yeah.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.302
I see you are making
fun of me, but I will.
No, yeah.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.137
Why don't you stop smiling?
I can't.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.939
Stop smiling.
I'm sorry.

13:27.941 --> 13:31.242
This early midlife crisis
is so you, I can't stand it.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.778
You want something
to smile about?

13:33.780 --> 13:36.915
No, please.
Do you, do you really?

13:48.094 --> 13:50.161
hi, can I speak
to Michael please?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.696
Hey, Tanner, it's Kate.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.364
Yeah, Kevin's sister.
How are you?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.533
Oh, good. Are you by any chance

13:55.535 --> 13:56.968
available on the third
for a charity event?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.336
Hey, I have a
question for you:

13:58.338 --> 13:59.470
How do you feel
about homelessness?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.839
I know, it's a
bummer, right?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.006
<i> So, we're looking to cater</i>

14:02.008 --> 14:03.374
about 400 people.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.943
Your restaurant's definitely
gonna want to be a part of this.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.779
Oh, my-- I know. Um...

14:07.781 --> 14:08.813
Awesome, okay, great.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.181
Thanks, z. Bye.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.783
You're killer.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.687
I need you to take me
to Ashley's.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.689
Oh, well, what if
Kate gave you a ride?

14:17.691 --> 14:18.857
Do you mind?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.226
No.
Hi.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.760
Sorry.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.398
I'll be in the car, intern.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.577
Hey.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.713
Hey.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.014
Should we go in?
Yeah.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.016
Listen, what kind of party
is this anyway?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.150
'Cause everyone
seems pretty sad.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.352
Of course they're sad.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.020
It's a memorial service.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.221
Come on, in we go,

14:50.223 --> 14:52.790
before all the good cheese
is gone.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.731
What are we doing here?

14:59.733 --> 15:01.599
We are here

15:01.601 --> 15:03.902
because your wife--
do you remember her?

15:03.904 --> 15:05.270
I think so, yeah.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.205
The one that you love
more than life itself?

15:07.207 --> 15:08.673
Definitely rings a bell.
Got it.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.276
She wants to take a
look at this place.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.211
Okay, I'm looking.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.747
Geez, this place is whiter

15:15.749 --> 15:20.051
than Randall's already
pretty white other school.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.020
I mean, look at these kids.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.122
They look like little

15:24.124 --> 15:25.423
Nazi robots.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.091
That one's got a briefcase.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.228
I... no kid should be
carrying a briefcase.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.796
I think it's cute.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.631
Yeah, it's cute now; Next thing
you know, he's gonna be

15:33.633 --> 15:35.433
trapped in a cubicle
for the rest of his life.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.435
I tell you, it starts
with a briefcase,

15:37.437 --> 15:39.437
then you put on a tie,
you sit at a desk.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.306
Next thing you know,
you are so conditioned

15:41.308 --> 15:43.574
to the florescent lights
that when you step outside,

15:43.576 --> 15:45.877
the sun actually
burns your eyes.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.245
Wow.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.147
Yeah.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.115
Wow. Really?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.952
This isn't about me.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.188
Well, it certainly
isn't about Randall.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.259
Hey.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.461
Look, I...
I wasn't gonna say anything

16:03.463 --> 16:07.565
until I'd had a few
details worked out, but...

16:07.567 --> 16:10.435
I think I'm gonna
go out on my own.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.103
Start my own company.

16:12.105 --> 16:15.306
Big three homes. I just...

16:15.308 --> 16:20.078
Doesn't feel like
a very good time right now.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.482
I think it's great.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.250
I think you
should do it.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.853
It's not that easy, bec.

16:28.855 --> 16:32.490
I mean...
What does this place even cost?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.859
We'll figure it out.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.862
We'll figure it out-- we'll
send Randall to another school,

16:37.864 --> 16:40.832
we'll get him a tutor,
we'll do whatever we have to do.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.801
All right.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.769
I just don't want
you to be unhappy.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.738
I mean it.
Okay.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.876
All right.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.311
We'll come back.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.880
This is nice.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.949
It's very nice.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.553
Jemma, your mom told me
that you would be giving me

17:02.555 --> 17:04.355
Ashley's address.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.425
Jemma, will you answer me?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.497
Jemma, I'm gonna
need the address.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.798
Why?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.467
'Cause you need to get
back to work?
Yes.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.667
And if I didn't value the work,

17:17.670 --> 17:19.203
I wouldn't be tolerating
this attitude.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.838
Just so we're clear.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.976
What'd she tell you,
you'd be an associate?

17:24.978 --> 17:26.144
And you thought my mom was gonna

17:26.146 --> 17:27.545
give you actual
responsibilities,

17:27.547 --> 17:30.214
because a few c-list celebrities
take your calls?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.350
Clearly she only hired you
because she thinks

17:32.352 --> 17:34.519
the fat girl
can get through to me.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.687
Guess she figured,
bigger the better.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.657
You know, I actually
feel bad for you.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.392
What the hell?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.495
Yeah, well, don't feel
bad for me, okay?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.030
'Cause I have a ride home.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.231
I'm sorry?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.267
Get out.
What?

17:49.269 --> 17:53.471
Get out of the damn car, jemma,
before I toss you out of it!

17:55.208 --> 17:57.942
Oh, and you know what?
You can walk to Ashley's.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.611
And fat girl to fat girl,
if you keep up the pace,

18:00.613 --> 18:03.815
you can burn 417 calories
an hour walking.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.258
I love American cheese. Mm.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.028
English cheese is so
blue, it's angry.
Yeah.

18:17.030 --> 18:20.765
American cheese is like a...
A bed you can just fall into.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.568
So, whose good-bye party
is this anyway?

18:23.570 --> 18:26.704
Frank pendergrass-- tree branch
fell on him three days ago

18:26.706 --> 18:28.473
when he was jogging
through central park.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.907
Bang. Dead.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.442
Well, that sucks.
Mm-hmm.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.944
You knew him how?

18:32.946 --> 18:34.879
Oh, I didn't. No, the
obituary gave the address

18:34.881 --> 18:36.481
of the service so, I thought...

18:36.483 --> 18:37.715
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.117
What are you trying to say?

18:39.119 --> 18:40.418
Hello.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.720
I'm Frank's wife, grace.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.755
Hi.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.290
Hi. Uh, I'm Jessica.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.426
This is my husband, David.
Oh.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.728
Were you students
of my husband?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.630
We actually met in his class.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.866
Oh.
Right?

18:58.171 --> 18:59.570
Students.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.638
Mm.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
Yeah, we were sitting
in the front row,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.008
and we kept looking
at each other,

19:04.010 --> 19:06.177
and then finally Frank stopped
the class and said,

19:06.179 --> 19:08.646
"you two are distracting me.
Go outside, have sex,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.249
and come back when you're ready
to learn something."

19:11.251 --> 19:13.284
Well, that sounds like Frank.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.652
Yeah.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.820
Frank.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.788
Thank you both
so much for coming.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.291
Thank you for coming.
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.993
Thank you.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.662
Well done.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.098
No, no, no, hold on.
No, no, no. You brought...

19:27.100 --> 19:28.499
You brought me

19:28.501 --> 19:29.834
to a stranger's funeral?

19:29.836 --> 19:32.203
Memorial service.
Whatever. Why, huh?

19:32.205 --> 19:33.938
What, because I'm struggling
with the grief scene?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.373
You said I would get there.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.441
Yeah, well, I didn't say
you'd get there on your own.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.676
This is insane.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.344
But thank you very much
for the lesson.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.680
I appreciate it.
Now I'm gonna go have a drink.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.348
Enjoy your cheese.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.688
Hey, baby, what happened
to <i> jungle book?</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:53.024
It's over.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.126
Well, mommy snuck in
a quick shower-- shh.

19:55.128 --> 19:57.595
Got to get them in
while you can, little bug.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.531
You're so pretty.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.533
Thank you, baby.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.003
Well, if I'm pretty, you're
pretty, 'cause we look alike.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.371
Oh, can you get

20:07.373 --> 20:10.041
mommy's yellow blouse,
the one with the buttons?

20:10.043 --> 20:12.143
Just in the closet? Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.279
Ooh.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.491
Thank you, bug.

20:27.493 --> 20:28.726
Mwah.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.328
Okay, I'm going to
pick up Randall.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.829
Good-bye, beautiful.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.731
Bye, see you later.
All right, baby,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.766
I'm almost done getting ready.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.071
Tonight, little man,
you, me and a b-52?
Okay!

20:40.073 --> 20:42.073
Okay, don't finish it;
I got to help with something.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.641
Sounds good.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.017
I'm sorry. I was,
i was, uh...

20:53.019 --> 20:56.587
People keep bringing me things,
like I forgot how to cook.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.222
Mm, there's no room in here

20:58.224 --> 21:01.959
and I don't know where to put
all of Frank's food.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.935
You have a lot
of pickles.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.774
I hate pickles.
Mm-hmm.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.376
But he loves them.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.212
Yeah, he eats them in bed.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.483
"Ate."

21:25.485 --> 21:27.818
He is now past tense.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.289
He used to be "is."

21:31.291 --> 21:33.024
Now he is "was."

21:36.129 --> 21:38.663
Hey, I like pickles.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.898
Good.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.733
Here.
Okay.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.339
How do you feel
about holiday ties?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.974
And sport coats.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.475
Because I asked Jeremy,

21:51.477 --> 21:55.980
but he said he didn't
want anything of his dad's.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.815
Yeah.

21:59.252 --> 22:02.253
How old is Jeremy?

22:02.255 --> 22:03.721
Fifteen.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.325
That's tough.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.393
15 is tough.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.165
Uh, my dad and I...

22:14.167 --> 22:17.601
Used to build models
together, when I was a kid.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.003
Yeah?

22:19.005 --> 22:22.273
Yeah, we'd build, um,
planes and boats.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.508
I used to pick the
most complex ones--

22:24.510 --> 22:26.344
b-52s, aircraft carriers--

22:26.346 --> 22:28.212
'cause they took the
longest, you know?

22:28.214 --> 22:30.114
See, I was one
of three kids,

22:30.116 --> 22:32.149
so you really had to strategize
to get your alone time with dad.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.517
You know, and eventually,

22:33.519 --> 22:35.853
we had a whole fleet of them;
We had just rows and rows,

22:35.855 --> 22:37.054
shelves of them.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.790
You know, and then
when he died...

22:40.660 --> 22:41.959
...when...

22:41.961 --> 22:44.295
When he, when he died, I, um...

22:47.033 --> 22:50.368
...i... I threw all
the models away.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.169
I threw every one
of them away.

22:52.171 --> 22:55.873
I don't know why...
Why I did that, you know?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.008
You were how old?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.811
Uh, it was a
long time ago.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.582
I have, um...

23:04.584 --> 23:06.917
I have this.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.887
This necklace, this
is his and, um,

23:09.889 --> 23:13.724
it's the only thing
i have left of him.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.826
And at first, you know,
i didn't want to wear it,

23:15.828 --> 23:19.230
I wouldn't wear it, I wouldn't
even look at it, but now it's...

23:20.666 --> 23:23.667
It's all I have and i-i
can't take it off now, so...

23:24.771 --> 23:27.471
It's okay.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.285
Oh, my God,
this is so dumb.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.686
What am I doing?
I'm...

23:42.688 --> 23:45.756
Supposed to be comforting you,
not snotting all over you.

23:47.260 --> 23:50.161
Who are you again?

23:58.771 --> 23:59.770
Hey.
Hi.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.938
Randall,

24:00.940 --> 24:02.907
your daddy's here.
- We're almost done.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.708
Best two out of three.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.043
Okay.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.248
Hey, thanks for...
Thanks for having him.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.818
Oh, I will take him
as much as he'll have it.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.786
Show my own boys
what manners look like.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.222
Okay.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.157
Um...

24:20.159 --> 24:23.461
Hey, did Rebecca tell
you about his school?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.663
No. What happened?

24:25.665 --> 24:29.133
I guess he scored off
the charts on some tests,

24:29.135 --> 24:32.002
and now they want to uproot him
during the school year,

24:32.004 --> 24:34.004
send him to some
private academy.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.506
You know, take him away
from the other two.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.141
Why? Is it, is it
a boarding school?

24:37.143 --> 24:37.975
No.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.610
No, it's, uh...

24:39.612 --> 24:42.813
It's uniforms and...

24:42.815 --> 24:44.982
A lot of little white kids

24:44.984 --> 24:47.318
marching around like
it's Nazi Germany.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.653
Oh, I see.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.889
That's why you're
running this by me.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.158
What?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.326
You're looking for me
to give you

24:55.328 --> 24:56.994
the black person
seal of approval

24:56.996 --> 24:59.997
for any messed-up
parenting decision you make.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.132
How is it messed up? I just--

25:02.134 --> 25:05.002
I don't want my son
to feel more different.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.772
Okay, so you just want to hold
him back because he's black?

25:08.774 --> 25:11.609
No. Absolutely not. I...

25:11.611 --> 25:13.344
Jack,

25:13.346 --> 25:15.980
Randall is special.
Yeah.

25:15.982 --> 25:20.217
So, if you're looking for
somebody to make you feel better

25:20.219 --> 25:24.522
about denying him
a special opportunity,

25:24.524 --> 25:27.925
you may just have to find
yourself another black person.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.794
See you, guys.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.530
Ready, Freddy.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.998
Bye, Ms. yvette.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.866
Did you win?
Yep.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.390
and I'll never forget
the look on her face

25:59.392 --> 26:02.226
when I placed her child
back into her arms.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.193
Never.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.194
So, yeah, that's what I do.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.330
Day in and day out, I...

26:06.332 --> 26:09.567
Save children,
just like you guys, from fires.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.602
Thank you.

26:13.573 --> 26:17.274
Let's give it up for
Kendal's mom, Mandy! Yeah.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.512
All right, okay,
uh, up next is

26:21.514 --> 26:25.082
Tessa's dad, Randall,
who is a weatherman.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.419
Oh, sorry, sorry.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.253
Uh, strike that.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.156
He's a... weather trader.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.927
I don't know what that is,
but I think he's gonna tell us.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.095
Here's Randall.

26:46.472 --> 26:47.605
Hey, y'all.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.107
Uh, yeah.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.609
I'm a weather trader,

26:51.611 --> 26:55.079
which I know can be
a little bit hard to explain,

26:55.081 --> 26:57.948
and so, um...

26:57.950 --> 27:00.451
I wrote you guys a song
about it.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.494
I thought daddy couldn't
play the piano?

27:10.496 --> 27:12.463
Daddy cannot.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.568
wait, mm, hold on one second.
Sorry about that.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.069
Oh, sweet Jesus.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.706
mm. One second, please.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.515
come on everybody.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.795
look away. Just look away.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.002
ah, there you are.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.537
I was with grace.

28:26.539 --> 28:27.371
Who?

28:27.373 --> 28:29.907
Grace. Frank's wife.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.508
Why?

28:31.510 --> 28:34.378
Because she's sad.
Her husband died.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.113
Why are you mad at me?

28:38.384 --> 28:41.018
Because we shouldn't be here.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.586
This is not a play.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.388
You know, she's a real person.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.889
I'm a real person.

28:45.891 --> 28:49.226
Yeah, I can see that--
maybe for the first time.

28:50.896 --> 28:51.895
What happened to you?

28:51.897 --> 28:53.597
What happened is my dad died.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.232
That's what.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.936
And I hated him for it.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.537
And I couldn't eat for a month,

29:00.539 --> 29:02.406
and I used to
wake myself up crying,

29:02.408 --> 29:04.341
so I could cry myself
back to sleep again.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.344
That's what happened.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.646
Why do you push
all of that away?

29:12.418 --> 29:14.418
You can't just kill the feelings

29:14.420 --> 29:17.054
like they're some creature
that you're afraid of.

29:17.056 --> 29:20.357
That pain is
a part of you.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.260
I can see it now.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.329
I can feel it.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.638
Sorry, pickle mouth.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.373
I don't care.

29:44.717 --> 29:45.983
Is jemma okay?

29:45.985 --> 29:47.551
What? She's fine.

29:47.553 --> 29:50.220
She said she had
a really nice day with you.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.489
Which I didn't believe
for a second,

29:52.491 --> 29:55.325
because you didn't come back,
so I pressed.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.963
I am really sorry
that I left her.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.232
I can understand
if you want to press charges

30:02.234 --> 30:03.901
for child abandonment.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.903
God, don't even
worry about it.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.404
I've left her at
three malls myself,

30:07.406 --> 30:09.306
and I've wanted to shove
her out of the car

30:09.308 --> 30:11.241
on the freeway
at least once.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.577
I don't know what to do
with her anymore.

30:13.579 --> 30:16.747
I can't reach her.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.448
Before yesterday,

30:18.450 --> 30:21.618
she's spoken seven words
to me in two weeks.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.920
And you heard them:

30:22.922 --> 30:24.955
"I see you hired
the fat one."

30:25.958 --> 30:27.624
Is that why you hired me?

30:27.626 --> 30:30.794
No! God, no.

30:30.796 --> 30:32.196
Not entirely.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.931
Yeah, I thought so.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.365
I am not proud of it.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.368
I am sorry and it's really
not the only reason.

30:38.370 --> 30:42.539
I-i liked your resume
before I met you.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.042
But, yeah.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.211
I thought that maybe
you'd be able to...

30:47.213 --> 30:49.046
Understand her.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.114
Her issues.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.350
Oh, my God, it
sounds horrible

30:53.352 --> 30:55.452
when I say it out loud.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.121
God, please don't quit.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.395
No more personal stuff.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.298
You saw my work;
You know I can do it.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
No more driving jemma around.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.135
Yu can afford
an assistant for that.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.204
Done.
And I want to chair
the butterfly ball.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.806
It's yours.
And I want an office.

31:15.808 --> 31:17.307
Okay.
And I want an intern.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.344
Okay, too far.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.482
I'll see you
at 9:00 tomorrow.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.050
Thank you.

31:29.655 --> 31:30.921
Hey, is jemma still here?

31:30.923 --> 31:31.989
She's outside.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.224
Okay.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.263
Hello? Hello?
Pearson corporation.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.498
Would you like to
discuss the big deal?

31:41.500 --> 31:45.002
Well, I'm too busy.
You'll have to call back.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.537
You love coming
to work with dad, huh?

31:47.539 --> 31:53.510
I wanted you here because
i need your help with something.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.612
Come here.

31:56.749 --> 31:58.582
What's that?

31:58.584 --> 32:01.752
That is a house
the company's working on.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.621
Cool.
Yeah.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.024
You see, uh...

32:07.026 --> 32:09.593
You see, I don't know

32:09.595 --> 32:12.195
how many feet of two-by-four
I'm gonna need

32:12.197 --> 32:13.530
for this wall
right here.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.699
You see how each...
How each inch is...

32:15.701 --> 32:16.733
Is three feet?

32:16.735 --> 32:19.269
22h feet.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.038
Wow.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.539
That's pretty cool, buddy.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.108
Didn't know you were
so good with numbers.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.544
Wait, wait, wait.
Come here.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.114
What about this wall
right here?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.383
How many... how many
do I need for that?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.619
I don't know that one.

32:37.323 --> 32:41.058
You knew how do it
a second ago, now you don't?

32:41.060 --> 32:42.259
I don't know it, dad.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.593
I think you do.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.729
I don't.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.065
Randall, that's enough.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.434
Come here.
I don't want to.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.804
Look. This wall, right here.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.472
How much do I need?

32:55.474 --> 32:58.008
I don't know.
I don't know.
Tell me the answer.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.409
How many feet?
Tell me right now.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.577
I don't know.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.846
Damn, it, Randall,
tell me the answer!

33:04.917 --> 33:06.116
34.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.918
What's that?

33:07.920 --> 33:09.519
34.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.225
That's right.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.930
Why are you pretending
not to know this stuff, huh?

33:19.932 --> 33:21.598
Getting b's in math?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.600
Not letting people see
how smart you are?

33:23.602 --> 33:25.702
I don't want to be
different from them.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.305
Different from who?
Who, the kids at school?

33:28.307 --> 33:32.275
If... if I get an a,
I'll get ice cream,

33:32.277 --> 33:33.877
and Kate and Kevin won't.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.679
And then they'll hate me.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.189
Can I be honest with you?

33:46.191 --> 33:47.391
Man to man?

33:47.393 --> 33:50.027
You know, your mom and me,
we always try

33:50.029 --> 33:52.029
to treat you kids
the same.

33:52.031 --> 33:54.898
Always have.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.300
Hasn't always worked,
because, well,

33:57.302 --> 33:58.869
you're not all the same.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.974
You're adopted, and we don't
talk about that enough.

34:03.976 --> 34:06.810
'Cause to me,
you are every part my son.

34:08.746 --> 34:14.284
Maybe I.. I don't want you
to feel like you stand out.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.255
But I need you
to know something.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.525
I want you to stand out.

34:22.527 --> 34:25.929
I want all of you
to be as different

34:25.931 --> 34:28.998
as you can possibly be.

34:29.001 --> 34:30.900
In all the best ways.

34:32.538 --> 34:36.406
I love you as much as
a human heart can, kiddo.

34:36.408 --> 34:40.243
You are an exceptional
young man.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.447
So don't let your dad's

34:43.449 --> 34:49.619
poor choice make you feel afraid
to be different.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.855
Okay?

34:53.025 --> 34:54.757
Okay.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.466
Okay.

35:14.046 --> 35:16.246
Sounds better when you
put your fingers on it.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.782
Hmm.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.951
You know how,
in the movies,

35:20.953 --> 35:22.586
when somebody's bad
at something,

35:22.588 --> 35:24.054
but they don't want to be,

35:24.056 --> 35:27.090
and so they set
their mind to it.

35:27.092 --> 35:28.959
And then we see this montage

35:28.961 --> 35:31.328
of them practicing
and practicing.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.798
And then comes the big moment,
and they're amazing,

35:34.800 --> 35:36.166
and everybody cheers.

35:36.168 --> 35:39.469
I've seen a few movies
like that, yeah.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.404
I think I skipped the montage.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.178
When you first told me
what you did for a living,

35:48.180 --> 35:49.679
man, I didn't
understand a word.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.114
Hand to God, I mean,

35:51.116 --> 35:54.117
you might as well have
been speaking German.

35:54.119 --> 35:57.154
But I was watching
your face.

35:57.156 --> 36:00.290
In my better days,
i have met and played with

36:00.292 --> 36:03.160
some of the greatest
musicians in the world.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.629
And when they talked
about music,

36:05.631 --> 36:07.664
their face looked
like your face

36:07.666 --> 36:12.035
when you told me about
whatever the hell it is you do.

36:12.037 --> 36:15.172
But if it'll help, I can
show you a thing or two

36:15.174 --> 36:16.339
on the piano.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.674
That would be great.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.843
Oh, not tonight, just...
Oh, right.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.312
It's late is the thing.
Yeah. No.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.413
I got ya.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.117
Good night.

36:27.119 --> 36:28.285
Night.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.962
You don't have to
say bye to me.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.764
I didn't quit.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.471
I know what
you're going through.

36:48.473 --> 36:51.374
Stop trying to have
a moment with me.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.717
So, my mom was skinny
and gorgeous.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.852
Well,<i> is</i> gorgeous.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.355
She still gets
hit on by everyone.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.891
She once was asked
if she was a model

37:07.893 --> 37:09.226
when she had the flu.

37:09.228 --> 37:13.363
Pretty hard growing up
with a mom like that.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.899
I spent all my time
comparing myself to her,

37:15.901 --> 37:17.901
and then I took it out on her.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.570
And now we barely talk,
and it sucks.

37:23.242 --> 37:26.276
Hey, your mom's
not perfect.

37:26.278 --> 37:29.212
She has her stuff,
and you have yours, but...

37:29.214 --> 37:33.049
You got to cut her a break.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.385
Or you're gonna regret it.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.987
I promise.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.091
Kate, will you please
help me out?

37:41.093 --> 37:42.559
No, I hate this dress!

37:42.561 --> 37:44.861
I know. I don't care
that you hate it, though.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.229
It's what's clean
and what fits,

37:46.231 --> 37:48.431
and it's what you're wearing.
I hate you!

37:50.068 --> 37:52.035
Put it on, please;
We're running late.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.270
Hey, Jack?
- Yeah?

37:53.272 --> 37:54.771
Randall?
You guys are ready?
Yeah.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.940
We have to leave
in five minutes.
I know. I got him.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.775
You sure about this?

37:58.777 --> 37:59.943
Yeah, I'm sure.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.646
Hey, listen to
your mother.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.781
See, you look great.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.150
Come get your lunch,
young lady.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.451
Thank you.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.720
got it.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.055
See it?
Yeah.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.124
Yeah. Takes a little time, but

38:14.126 --> 38:15.792
You'll get the hang of it.

38:15.794 --> 38:16.993
Here, look at me.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.928
Looking sharp.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.130
You ready for
your first day?

38:20.132 --> 38:22.299
Are Kate and Kevin
gonna ride with us?

38:22.301 --> 38:23.800
We're gonna
drop them off,

38:23.802 --> 38:26.002
then we're gonna
drop you off,

38:26.004 --> 38:27.270
and then we'll all
be back together

38:27.272 --> 38:29.806
after school, okay?
Okay.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.175
Hey, wait. Come here.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.812
We'll tuck this low.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.347
Nice and comfortable.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.217
Say bye to your mom.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.293
Hot, plump ones
coming through.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.829
Mm-hmm. Whoo!
Oh, um, mom,

38:52.831 --> 38:54.664
I have a soccer practice
after school today.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.699
Yeah, I remember.

38:55.701 --> 38:56.900
Come on.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.040
I have something to say.

39:05.977 --> 39:10.046
Uh... my dad put on
a tie every day

39:10.048 --> 39:12.015
because he had to.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.417
I put one on every day
because I want to.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.887
It's important
you know that.

39:17.889 --> 39:21.324
Maybe I don't run into
burning buildings for a living,

39:21.326 --> 39:25.528
but to me, my work is
challenging and exciting.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.364
I will not apologize
for the fact

39:27.366 --> 39:29.699
that it's hard to explain
to people.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.368
Okay, daddy.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.638
Uh, also, William,

39:35.640 --> 39:37.874
thank you for offering
to teach me piano,

39:37.876 --> 39:39.542
but I don't think
at this point

39:39.544 --> 39:41.211
in our relationship
it would be healthy

39:41.213 --> 39:43.113
to introduce
that dynamic.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.316
And so,

39:46.318 --> 39:48.885
starting next Tuesday, I'm gonna
be taking piano lessons

39:48.887 --> 39:50.620
from Mrs. Perkins down the road.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.225
There's gonna be
a recital in the spring,

39:55.227 --> 39:58.628
and I hope that you will all
come and support me in this.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.071
What was that?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.606
That was a midlife crisis, baby.

40:09.608 --> 40:13.243
But just a little one,
so go on, eat your waffle.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.179
"Just a little one."
That's good.

40:16.181 --> 40:18.448
He-he's gonna take piano?

40:18.450 --> 40:19.749
Psst, hey!

40:19.751 --> 40:20.884
Brought you a cappuccino.

40:21.887 --> 40:22.919
Soy, yeah?

40:22.921 --> 40:24.954
You're too kind.
Yeah.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.524
Also wanted to say
that, uh...

40:27.526 --> 40:29.926
You know, I wanted to say
that I forgive you.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.361
For the lesson. Um...

40:32.531 --> 40:35.231
What can I say?
It worked.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.033
Mm, I'd say it did.
Yeah.

40:37.035 --> 40:39.869
But, um, that's not
the only lesson.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.272
No? Okay.

40:42.274 --> 40:45.442
What happened
between you and me...

40:46.878 --> 40:49.345
...is never gonna happen again.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.449
Oh. I-i thought...

40:52.451 --> 40:54.784
I know you did,
but this is who we are

40:54.786 --> 40:56.386
and all we are.

40:56.388 --> 41:00.557
You're my husband,
and I'm your dead wife.

41:00.559 --> 41:04.494
And you will never
sleep with her again.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.030
Now, how does that
make you feel?

41:10.435 --> 41:11.434
Sad.

41:11.436 --> 41:12.802
Great.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.138
Use that.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.644
Okay.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.227
Hey.
Hey.

41:54.212 --> 41:55.678
so what was that
about teleportation?

41:55.680 --> 41:58.014
Yeah, the teleportation
and the freeze breath

41:58.016 --> 41:59.015
or, like, hot breath.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.718
Hey, have fun.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.053
Bye, dad.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.255
Love you.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.558
