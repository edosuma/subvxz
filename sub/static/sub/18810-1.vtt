SADAKO VS. KAYAKO

01:12.800 --> 01:14.700
Excuse me!

01:16.909 --> 01:18.900
Yatsue San!

01:19.945 --> 01:25.850
I'm a welfare officer of Tachibana district, we have been trying to contact you, are you okay?

01:27.086 --> 01:29.884
Yatsue San!

01:50.910 --> 01:52.844
Yatsue San?

01:54.146 --> 01:57.013
Hello, is anyone home?

02:39.091 --> 02:43.960
Yatsue San, why didn't you answer me?

03:24.069 --> 03:26.867
Yatsue San?

04:32.003 --> 04:34.096
University Of The Arts Seuian.

04:34.138 --> 04:38.074
Now, these are some of the most famous folk legends.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.325
The Slit-Mouthed Woman.

04:42.146 --> 04:44.944
Hanako Of The Toilet.

04:45.116 --> 04:47.107
The Red Veil.

04:47.986 --> 04:50.853
The Boy under the bed.

04:50.955 --> 04:53.924
The House of the dead, and my favourite ...

04:54.859 --> 04:56.850
The damned Video.

04:58.029 --> 05:01.988
Who among you has ever heard the folk legend?

05:05.069 --> 05:06.866
Nice.

05:07.071 --> 05:14.068
And now, does any on know a person who has had personal experience with these phenomena?

05:15.947 --> 05:17.107
No one?

05:18.082 --> 05:23.952
Why is that? - Because they are all just made up.

05:23.955 --> 05:30.986
Folklore, is passed down and relies solely on memory.

05:31.029 --> 05:33.862
Despite that.

05:33.965 --> 05:38.902
The damned video legend is different from others.

05:38.937 --> 05:41.963
And I am fascinated by it.

05:43.875 --> 05:48.869
The dammed video legend first appeared late in 1990.

05:48.913 --> 05:54.078
It is said that, if you watch the video, a ghost named Sadako will call.

05:54.085 --> 05:56.952
They say that you will die within 2 days.

05:56.988 --> 05:59.957
two days later, after 48 hours ...

05:59.991 --> 06:02.118
Sadako will appear and claim you.

06:02.126 --> 06:05.027
And you're going to die.

06:05.964 --> 06:11.925
The actual video has long since disapeared and the legend has died.

06:11.936 --> 06:15.099
But even after all this time, I think the video still exists.

06:15.139 --> 06:17.903
- And the story of sadako is real.

06:18.843 --> 06:24.076
But if it did exist, it would exist on the internet.

06:26.084 --> 06:30.851
I would pay lots of money for the original video.

06:30.888 --> 06:34.984
Wait, wait, I'm serious. I really want to see Sadako.

06:35.059 --> 06:38.825
But - 2 days.

06:45.970 --> 06:50.134
If you ask why; well,  I'm obsessed with that video.

06:50.875 --> 06:54.971
Please read the reason, everything is in this book.

06:55.046 --> 06:56.911
I wrote it.

06:56.948 --> 07:00.907
I'm Jimmy Morishige, I published it myself.

07:00.952 --> 07:02.010
Please buy.

07:02.020 --> 07:04.989
Well, that's it for today, thank you.

07:24.075 --> 07:27.977
Hey Yuri, you're good with electronic devices right?

07:27.979 --> 07:30.072
Better than you Natsumi.

07:31.849 --> 07:34.943
Please help me with this.

07:34.986 --> 07:36.977
What is this? video recording?

07:37.989 --> 07:42.983
My people threw away their video player -it was broken

07:44.896 --> 07:47.023
-This is a video of their wedding? -Yes.

07:47.031 --> 07:51.832
So I promised them, I will burn it to a DVD as a wedding anniversary gift.

07:51.836 --> 07:53.929
And guess what, I think of you.

07:53.971 --> 07:55.063
Really?

07:55.106 --> 07:58.075
-You're really slow as hell ... -That's why,

07:58.076 --> 08:01.045
Miss yuri clever, please help me.

08:01.045 --> 08:05.948
Well, I think I'm going to think about it.

08:05.983 --> 08:09.851
-When is her birthday? -The day after tomorrow.

08:09.854 --> 08:12.118
In 2 days? How can I do that fast?

08:12.123 --> 08:15.024
I'll treat you to Yuri.

08:15.927 --> 08:18.828
How about lunch?

08:20.865 --> 08:21.957
Already.

08:43.955 --> 08:46.822
Suzuka, we are here.

08:50.862 --> 08:55.026
Oh you don't seem happy to be moving to a new place.

08:57.902 --> 09:02.839
I'm sorry we had to do this because of my new job.

09:02.974 --> 09:05.875
Don't worry, that's life.

09:08.045 --> 09:09.842
-Thank you. -Okay.

09:09.914 --> 09:12.007
Please - carefully.

09:12.049 --> 09:13.846
Where does this go?

09:13.885 --> 09:17.878
It goes into the room of the second floor, Suzuka, okay?

09:17.922 --> 09:21.949
It also goes on the second floor. Thanks.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.094
Hey, do you come here often?

10:38.869 --> 10:41.895
Yes, my daily bus passes here.

10:42.873 --> 10:44.966
But you never go in here?

10:45.977 --> 10:48.002
Good afternoon.

10:51.015 --> 10:55.076
Yuri, wait, do you think that a place like this would have a Video Player?

10:55.119 --> 10:59.055
In fact, this is the only place we could find it.

10:59.056 --> 11:01.957
That is not too expensive?

11:01.993 --> 11:04.120
Santai, I'm sure the prices will be cheaper.

11:04.128 --> 11:07.928
Now it's missing the video deck.

11:08.032 --> 11:10.933
Oh maybe next to here.

11:14.872 --> 11:16.840
This is it!

11:20.978 --> 11:23.947
Hey, this seems like a bargain.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.074
But it's  dirty as hell.

11:26.083 --> 11:29.075
Well, it's done a lot of work but it's cheap.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.978
-We'll take. -Wait.

11:31.022 --> 11:33.013
-Oh no, wait. -This is it.

11:36.093 --> 11:39.085
Yuck! -Dirty as hell.

11:50.975 --> 11:55.105
Why did I have to carry everything? You're so horrible.

11:55.146 --> 11:58.946
I let you use this room and I'm the chief engineer.

11:58.949 --> 12:01.076
And you're the operations manager.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.821
That's why you get to decide everything?

12:04.855 --> 12:06.880
Good, it seems okay.

12:27.078 --> 12:28.978
What's that?

12:32.883 --> 12:34.111
Want to watch?

12:35.052 --> 12:37.111
No, wait, don't, it looks scary.

12:37.154 --> 12:40.123
Well, if you don't want to,  you don't have to watch.

12:49.967 --> 12:53.869
Yuri, stop! I don't think we should watch it.

12:53.871 --> 12:56.066
It doesn't show anything.

13:10.054 --> 13:12.113
"Free Sunday! ''

13:31.942 --> 13:34.911
Already done? Can we watch it again?

13:34.945 --> 13:36.970
No, jangna!

13:39.083 --> 13:42.075
What is Natsumi?

13:43.154 --> 13:51.858
Yuri, I think this is the damned video.

13:51.862 --> 13:53.853
The cursed video?

13:53.898 --> 13:56.867
-Morishige will pay dearly for it, give it to me. -Not!

13:57.134 --> 14:00.865
I had a bad feeling.

14:00.871 --> 14:02.862
What is it? Let me see.

14:02.907 --> 14:09.005
But if this is the damned video, then I will die in 2 days.

14:09.013 --> 14:12.949
Look, the legend is obviously just a joke sick. See, there's no call from Sadako.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.906
Yuri ...

14:52.022 --> 14:55.048
'' Caller ID Witheld ''

15:26.891 --> 15:30.019
Natsumi? What is it?

15:30.928 --> 15:34.989
Natsumi? Are you alright? Natsumi?

15:41.071 --> 15:42.936
Mitsuko!

15:43.073 --> 15:46.975
Guess what, I wasable to sell that tape deck with the cursed video.

15:46.977 --> 15:52.108
-Huh? You sold it with the video inside.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.850
What cursed video?

15:54.885 --> 15:58.981
He said there was a strange video in one of the VHS player.

15:59.089 --> 16:03.924
If you watch the video it's damned, you're going to die two days later.

16:03.928 --> 16:05.054
2 days later?

16:05.129 --> 16:08.121
They say it will call the ghost of Sadako.

16:08.132 --> 16:12.068
The funny thing is, there really was a phone call after I watched it.

16:12.102 --> 16:14.093
Oh really?

16:14.838 --> 16:19.002
The phone call was just a coincidence, but the timing was right.

16:20.010 --> 16:25.138
I will watch out in 2 days to see if it works.

16:25.049 --> 16:27.984
I guess I will soon die.

16:28.919 --> 16:32.855
Hey Mitsuko, did you watch it?

16:32.923 --> 16:34.891
I didn't watch it.

16:34.992 --> 16:38.894
Keikosan, what is in the video?

16:41.865 --> 16:43.958
Keikosan;

16:50.107 --> 16:52.098
Keikosan;

17:09.993 --> 17:12.963
No no!

17:14.932 --> 17:17.992
Keiko, don't!

17:19.136 --> 17:21.104
No!

18:33.844 --> 18:38.042
Wait! uh, you're  Suzuka, you live near the haunted house right?

18:38.115 --> 18:41.084
Really? Right next to the abandoned house?

18:41.085 --> 18:44.020
Well ...

18:44.054 --> 18:45.851
Not funny.

18:47.925 --> 18:50.052
Wait what's wrong?

18:50.961 --> 18:53.896
You would know if you ask that question around here.

18:54.031 --> 18:57.933
That place is a haunted house.

18:59.103 --> 19:00.968
A haunted House?

19:01.004 --> 19:04.030
Long ago there were murder and suicides there.

19:04.842 --> 19:09.939
A husband stabbed his wife to death and then drowned their son in the bath.

19:10.114 --> 19:14.016
And the husband ... UH.. He committed suicide.

19:14.017 --> 19:15.951
He hanged himself.

19:16.019 --> 19:17.850
Is that true?

19:18.856 --> 19:20.050
Yes, possibly.

19:20.858 --> 19:23.053
-But everyone knows that. -It's a popular story.

19:23.927 --> 19:26.054
How long ago?

19:27.965 --> 19:29.865
Decades ago.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.934
That's what I've heard.

19:34.972 --> 19:39.102
The mystery was ... After that ... Anyone who lived there died in terrible circumstances.

19:39.109 --> 19:41.839
-As if  there is a curse or something. -Yes.

19:41.879 --> 19:44.871
Of suicide or sudden death.

19:44.948 --> 19:47.974
And the murder or death of an accident.

19:56.026 --> 19:59.018
Well, what's in the cards?

20:01.031 --> 20:05.024
The people who entered the House died because of the curse.

20:05.068 --> 20:07.002
So no one lives there.

20:08.906 --> 20:12.000
You must never go near that house, Suzuka.

20:16.046 --> 20:20.915
This is the worst combination of cards.

20:24.054 --> 20:27.114
Temporarily closed

20:32.930 --> 20:35.865
Sorry, girls, but we are closed today.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.993
Actually ...

20:39.937 --> 20:42.997
We bought this video player here, yesterday afternoon.

20:45.142 --> 20:49.943
And then, we found this tape inside.

20:54.918 --> 20:56.886
Did you watch it?

20:59.890 --> 21:01.084
Yes.

21:03.126 --> 21:07.062
An elderly person living alone, has just died.

21:07.097 --> 21:09.065
By commiting suicide.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.924
We bought the whole stuff from their home.

21:11.935 --> 21:14.836
At a really cheap price from a relative.

21:15.906 --> 21:17.874
But we heard that ...

21:17.908 --> 21:22.072
The same district welfare officer who discovered the body of the deceased.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.107
Also took their own life after two days.

21:26.884 --> 21:28.078
Is that true?

21:38.095 --> 21:42.964
Has someone, just died at the store, Sir?

21:44.968 --> 21:47.937
The part-time worker fell from the top floor.

21:51.842 --> 21:52.968
Two days ago.

21:53.110 --> 21:55.908
She watched the same video.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.941
And then she died earlier today.

22:04.787 --> 22:06.687
Two days later.

22:06.723 --> 22:08.691
They all died.

22:11.761 --> 22:13.786
I know, I have an idea.

22:14.631 --> 22:17.691
Come on, let's go to Mortosigha. Let's go talk to him. Okay?

22:28.745 --> 22:30.645
Oh, I know.

22:30.747 --> 22:32.612
You came to buy my book.

22:32.649 --> 22:34.708
-Professor Motoshiga. -Mm?

22:35.551 --> 22:37.610
We've done something terribly wrong.

22:38.788 --> 22:41.552
Save us from the cursed video.

22:41.591 --> 22:42.580
Why?

22:42.792 --> 22:45.693
I think. ..

22:46.562 --> 22:48.621
I accidentally watched it.

22:56.839 --> 22:59.740
This is. ..

23:00.843 --> 23:03.676
We think this is probably the real cursed video sir.

23:04.814 --> 23:06.782
A cursed video, Sir.

23:18.594 --> 23:24.726
You know, your story certainly matches the story I told you about
You know, I think this is the damned video.

23:24.734 --> 23:26.725
If it's really it.

23:27.704 --> 23:29.672
This would be an amazing discovery.

23:29.772 --> 23:30.761
Did you see Sadako?

23:30.773 --> 23:33.537
Who is Sadako?

23:33.710 --> 23:36.543
Ah, it's possible.

23:36.579 --> 23:40.572
That urban legend meme is an embodiment arising from the brain virus altering the collective stae of unconciousness of the mind.

23:40.616 --> 23:42.777
Increasing the level of collectve memory in the unconscious mind.

23:43.586 --> 23:46.749
Sorry?. I don't understand what you're talking about.

23:46.789 --> 23:49.656
 -In any case ...

23:49.692 --> 23:53.526
I want to know if you really can save me from this.

23:54.664 --> 23:57.792
Am I...going to die?

23:59.569 --> 24:02.800
Tomorrow night will be two days after I watched it.

24:05.575 --> 24:08.567
I don't enough information for you right now.

24:09.545 --> 24:11.809
Perhaps you will die or perhaps you won't

24:12.582 --> 24:14.709
You should also watch it, you got us into this.

24:14.751 --> 24:16.810
Don't say that, Natsumi.

24:22.692 --> 24:23.750
Hmmm...I think I will.

24:23.793 --> 24:25.556
Hah?

24:27.830 --> 24:31.698
But we don't know what will happen if you watch it.

24:32.602 --> 24:34.763
If this is indeed the original videotape.

24:35.772 --> 24:37.797
I would gladly die in two days.

24:38.674 --> 24:40.574
Both of you leave the room.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.718
I will copy it to the DVD!

24:49.852 --> 24:52.821
If this is genuine. This data is very valuable.

25:59.655 --> 26:00.781
Sadako?

26:03.593 --> 26:05.561
Sadako, is it you?

26:20.810 --> 26:23.574
-Professor? -What happened?

26:46.736 --> 26:48.727
This is it!

26:49.705 --> 26:51.639
At last!.

26:51.674 --> 26:54.643
This is a video of the original curse. This is authentic.

26:55.778 --> 26:58.576
But Sadako did not appear.

26:58.681 --> 27:03.550
Right, the experience is different. Depending on the person.

27:03.552 --> 27:04.814
It is a case to case thing.

27:05.554 --> 27:06.782
I found it.

27:14.697 --> 27:17.564
Professor Moroshiga, will we both die?

27:17.600 --> 27:19.761
-What? Hah? -Is there a way to be saved?

27:20.569 --> 27:22.696
You wrote the book so you must know about it.

27:23.773 --> 27:25.741
this is how you get rid of the curse.

27:25.741 --> 27:28.767
Show the video to someone.

27:28.811 --> 27:30.802
Show the video to others.

27:30.813 --> 27:34.749
That's right, Natsumi showed you the video, right?

27:35.718 --> 27:38.778
No, I got it from you.She didn't show me the video.

27:38.821 --> 27:41.722
You see, girls, it doesn't work that way.

27:42.825 --> 27:44.656
Right....

27:44.794 --> 27:48.696
Wait, this is not included in the book.

27:48.731 --> 27:50.562
It will be in the new edition.

27:50.599 --> 27:53.693
If our internal program or memes are rewritten at the moment before death...

27:53.736 --> 27:55.601
In the moments before death?

27:55.705 --> 27:58.538
So we just have to wait until that happens?

28:00.743 --> 28:02.802
I can't stand it.

28:03.746 --> 28:07.773
I'd rather kill myself than wait for Sadako.

28:08.651 --> 28:09.709
Natsumi.

28:09.719 --> 28:11.687
Well, in that case.

28:12.555 --> 28:15.615
I will try to find a medium that could perform an exorcism.

28:15.658 --> 28:20.595
Now, Yuri. You absolutely must not watch the video.

28:20.696 --> 28:23.529
So there's is a living witness if we die.

28:23.599 --> 28:24.759
In any case.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.768
Just wait for me to contact you.

28:27.570 --> 28:28.764
Okay?

28:55.698 --> 28:57.563
Hello there.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.726
Hello.

28:59.702 --> 29:01.727
Are you alright?

29:05.674 --> 29:06.732
We're back.

29:06.809 --> 29:08.834
We have something for you.

29:11.781 --> 29:13.749
Thank you.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.551
What's the problem?

29:17.820 --> 29:19.788
No, I'm fine.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.603
Remember, we have a deal, right?

29:38.674 --> 29:40.665
Are you scared?

29:41.777 --> 29:43.540
We have a gift for you.

29:43.679 --> 29:46.648
If you dare to enter the Haunted House.

29:50.686 --> 29:53.519
Now, here's your gift.

29:59.628 --> 30:02.529
Oh, you dropped one.

30:03.732 --> 30:04.790
I'm sorry.

30:05.801 --> 30:07.564
You are a very bad boy.

30:07.603 --> 30:09.628
Say it like you mean it.

30:10.606 --> 30:11.664
I'm very sorry.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.607
Now, get inside.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.612
You have to count to 1000 before you come back out here.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.547
Whatever happens, it's not our fault.

35:41.603 --> 35:44.766
Well. this should work.

35:48.644 --> 35:50.703
Hello? Moroshiga here.

35:50.746 --> 35:52.714
Oh, Madam, how are you?

35:52.748 --> 35:54.579
Yes.

35:54.716 --> 35:59.585
Ah, thank you very much. Yes. I'm on my way.

36:08.797 --> 36:10.697
This place.

36:11.700 --> 36:15.659
Is the place where I came to interview her.

36:15.671 --> 36:17.696
And watched her cast out an evil spirit.

36:17.706 --> 36:20.607
It was exceptional.

36:20.642 --> 36:21.631
She is a genuine medium.

36:21.777 --> 36:24.644
I'm sure that Haryu San can help you.

36:24.680 --> 36:29.708
The truth is. It is my nature to consider all the existing options.

36:31.854 --> 36:33.788
Thank you.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.658
Come on, let's go.

37:07.855 --> 37:10.824
Haryu San? What do you think?

37:11.892 --> 37:14.861
Do you sense an evil spirit?

37:15.663 --> 37:17.688
Moroshiga.

37:17.732 --> 37:20.701
This is more terrible than anything I've ever encountered.

37:20.801 --> 37:23.634
In my many years of excorcism.

37:25.906 --> 37:27.806
Is it Sadako?

37:29.810 --> 37:31.903
Can you see Sadako?

37:34.715 --> 37:37.775
There is nothing but absolute darkness.

37:38.753 --> 37:40.812
And there is so much evil.

37:43.924 --> 37:45.824
Excuse me.

37:46.761 --> 37:48.820
But will I..

37:48.929 --> 37:50.726
Die?

37:50.765 --> 37:52.824
Tomorrow, Madam?

37:54.702 --> 37:58.638
It is thed ay after tomorrow for me.

38:03.811 --> 38:06.871
You will die if nothing changes.

38:06.914 --> 38:09.781
But I won't let it happen.

38:09.784 --> 38:12.753
Clear my schedule for tomorrow and the day after that.

38:12.753 --> 38:15.779
-I'll have to deal with this. -Yes, Ma'am.

38:18.793 --> 38:20.852
Horiryu San.

38:21.829 --> 38:23.820
Don't be worry about me.

38:23.864 --> 38:27.857
But please, do your best to try to save it.

38:28.669 --> 38:30.694
What do you mean?

38:30.705 --> 38:33.697
You really want to see Sadako?

38:35.743 --> 38:38.769
If you want to die it is up to you.

38:38.879 --> 38:41.643
I'm sorry.

38:44.919 --> 38:47.854
Please, I beg you.

38:49.657 --> 38:52.683
Do whatever you can do to help me.

39:44.945 --> 39:47.880
All unwanted spirits and entities.

39:47.882 --> 39:50.851
All evil or negative energy.

39:50.885 --> 39:53.615
Leave!

39:53.721 --> 39:55.746
Elements I call thee to send this demon back.

39:55.756 --> 39:57.917
I will fight water with water and fire with fire.

39:57.925 --> 40:02.862
Banish the evil spirit into nothingness and rmove its powers.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.865
Drink!

40:23.851 --> 40:25.842
Drink!

40:30.925 --> 40:32.893
Drink more!.

40:46.807 --> 40:48.900
Yuri.

40:53.781 --> 40:55.806
Stop it!

40:59.854 --> 41:02.721
Leave it to Horiryu San.

41:22.877 --> 41:24.868
Whatever is inside this girl.

41:24.912 --> 41:27.881
I command you to show yourself!

41:37.691 --> 41:41.718
In thy holy name
I ask to destroy this evil.

41:41.762 --> 41:43.889
I will fight water with water and fire with fire.

41:43.931 --> 41:47.867
Banish the evil spirit and removed his powers.

42:11.759 --> 42:15.786
You will kill anyone who tries to stop you?

42:26.907 --> 42:29.842
Unbelievable.

42:37.651 --> 42:41.610
Morishige I am sorry I have failed.

42:41.655 --> 42:43.919
I've already called Kyozo. He should be here soon.

42:43.924 --> 42:45.755
Kyozo?

42:45.793 --> 42:47.818
Do you mean the actual Tokiwa Kyozo?

42:47.828 --> 42:49.762
Only Kyozo is powerful enough to do it.

42:49.797 --> 42:52.857
Put money under the altar for him.

42:57.771 --> 42:59.830
Horiyu San.

42:59.873 --> 43:01.841
Stop it! Stop it!

43:01.842 --> 43:03.673
Do you see Sadako?

43:03.711 --> 43:04.905
Tell me how I can see her!.

43:04.945 --> 43:06.879
Please tell me.

43:08.816 --> 43:10.716
Wait! wait!.

43:10.718 --> 43:14.711
Not Yet!

43:14.722 --> 43:17.691
Show Sadako to me!

43:27.701 --> 43:29.760
Natsumi.

43:29.803 --> 43:31.634
Natsumi.

43:31.638 --> 43:32.900
Natsumi.

43:33.841 --> 43:35.866
Are you alright?

43:35.909 --> 43:38.639
Talk to me.

43:39.646 --> 43:40.908
Natsumi.

43:47.721 --> 43:51.680
I'm not OK.

43:52.693 --> 43:56.823
I'm going to ... die without no help.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.861
I'm so sorry.

44:03.904 --> 44:07.863
Apologizing changes nothing now.

44:12.679 --> 44:15.705
Yuri, this is all your fault.

44:58.892 --> 45:00.826
Listen.

45:00.828 --> 45:03.626
We have to do this.

45:04.898 --> 45:06.695
What?

45:06.733 --> 45:08.826
It's okay. Give this to me.

45:13.707 --> 45:15.902
Just do it.

45:22.716 --> 45:24.911
Natsumi you gave it to me.

45:25.886 --> 45:28.855
Morishige's book said that when you give it to someone.

45:28.856 --> 45:32.724
They will replace you and save you from curse.

45:33.727 --> 45:34.887
Now it is my turn.

45:34.928 --> 45:37.897
To watch it.

45:37.898 --> 45:39.866
Hah?

48:25.832 --> 48:29.734
Tamao, can you sense anything?

48:31.772 --> 48:34.639
I feel nothing.

48:34.875 --> 48:37.673
At least for now.

48:38.679 --> 48:39.839
All right.

48:39.846 --> 48:41.814
It isn't okay.

48:52.826 --> 48:56.660
You've done the most stupid thing.

48:58.865 --> 49:01.766
I have always bee stupidn.

50:11.872 --> 50:13.863
You're master Kyozo.

50:13.907 --> 50:15.932
Am I right?

50:16.676 --> 50:17.904
Did you watch that video too?

50:17.911 --> 50:21.779
Great now you have given me more work to do.

50:21.915 --> 50:24.782
Do you mean that Natsumi's curse was not removed?

50:24.785 --> 50:25.774
What?

50:25.819 --> 50:27.844
You believe that stupid rumor?

50:27.854 --> 50:29.822
What a fool you are.

50:29.823 --> 50:32.815
Kyozo, here.

50:35.662 --> 50:36.856
The original video, right?

50:36.897 --> 50:38.626
Yes.

50:38.632 --> 50:40.691
Very good.

50:41.768 --> 50:43.759
You got the money?

51:00.654 --> 51:02.622
Whoa.

51:02.656 --> 51:04.681
That's a lot of money.

51:04.691 --> 51:07.785
Horiyu San left it for you master Kyozo.

51:10.664 --> 51:12.859
They died in vain.

51:12.866 --> 51:14.629
Stupid fools.

51:14.668 --> 51:17.694
He was trying to save Horiyu San.

51:17.737 --> 51:19.637
Who is this child?

51:19.673 --> 51:21.698
My colleague.

51:21.942 --> 51:25.673
I don't see any future for you.

51:29.850 --> 51:31.841
What is it?

51:32.719 --> 51:33.845
Are you really here to help?

51:33.887 --> 51:35.650
No.

51:35.689 --> 51:38.681
-Huh? -No one would want to help you miss.

51:38.825 --> 51:41.794
-I'm just kidding. -What?

51:41.828 --> 51:44.797
How can you be so insensitive?

51:44.798 --> 51:46.732
Hey.

51:47.901 --> 51:50.665
What about me?

51:51.671 --> 51:52.763
Tell me the truth.

51:52.772 --> 51:55.673
What's going to happen to me?

51:56.843 --> 51:59.835
Tamao, enough of that.

52:00.881 --> 52:03.873
Tell me, am I going to die?

52:07.921 --> 52:10.754
It will be difficult to remove this curse.

52:10.757 --> 52:15.751
However you will suffer greatly if you are afraid.

52:22.836 --> 52:25.737
Starting already?

52:29.709 --> 52:31.643
Natsumi?

52:44.724 --> 52:45.884
Sadako.

52:45.926 --> 52:47.917
I have always wanted to meet you.

52:47.928 --> 52:50.692
Show yourself.

52:51.831 --> 52:54.664
Show yourself!

53:19.926 --> 53:22.861
What you also need help?

53:36.910 --> 53:40.744
Natsumi. Natsumi.

53:40.914 --> 53:43.644
Natsumi, are you OK?

53:43.683 --> 53:45.674
Natsumi?

53:48.688 --> 53:52.715
Tamao, are you thinking what I am thinking?

53:52.726 --> 53:54.694
Yes.

53:56.863 --> 53:59.661
What do you plan to do?

54:00.867 --> 54:04.701
I will have two evil spirits fight each other.

54:10.710 --> 54:13.702
I thought you would enter with shoes on.

54:13.713 --> 54:15.874
So I'm afraid.

54:15.882 --> 54:17.873
Are you that stupi?

54:17.917 --> 54:19.714
Maybe I'll stop trying to save you.

54:19.753 --> 54:22.745
It's okay. Don't save them.

54:23.690 --> 54:26.818
Tell me how you plan to save us.

54:26.826 --> 54:28.885
Because tomorrow night. ..

54:28.928 --> 54:33.729
Is the second night after Natsumi watched the video.

54:34.868 --> 54:39.703
Listen, I will do whatever I have to do to help you.

54:39.739 --> 54:41.866
Good news for you.

54:42.676 --> 54:44.871
I will decide the details after doing some research.

54:44.911 --> 54:46.811
I'll come for you tomorrow.

54:46.846 --> 54:49.906
Stay here quietly until then.

54:49.916 --> 54:51.781
Okay.

54:51.785 --> 54:54.720
Should we stay inside?

54:54.788 --> 54:55.914
Why?

54:55.922 --> 55:03.886
Well, if we can't go outside I want you to try to make a DVD copy of this.

55:05.932 --> 55:07.900
For Natsumi.

55:08.735 --> 55:10.896
It's very important.

55:13.740 --> 55:16.903
You're wasting my time. -Thank you.

55:16.910 --> 55:19.845
Just call me if anything happens.

55:35.929 --> 55:40.832
I think about those kids, I think it's a kidnapping for human trafficking.

55:40.867 --> 55:41.856
Really?

55:41.901 --> 55:44.870
If someone tried it on me, I'll start kicking and screaming.

55:44.871 --> 55:49.604
Do you think you could do that? Anyway, they were all boys.

55:49.709 --> 55:51.870
They probably just ran away from home. -Yes.

55:51.878 --> 55:54.745
Suzuka, what do you think?

55:54.781 --> 55:55.839
Didn't you hear about it?

55:55.849 --> 55:58.613
Yesterday night not far from here,

55:58.651 --> 56:02.644
-Four elementary school children went missing, there is no news about them. -It's true.

56:02.689 --> 56:03.713
Hah?

56:03.723 --> 56:05.884
-Four boys? -Yes.

56:05.925 --> 56:08.826
You must be careful.

56:12.665 --> 56:14.724
Eventually.

56:14.734 --> 56:16.861
It's for you too.

56:16.903 --> 56:18.871
Oh, look at them.

56:18.872 --> 56:21.898
-They look so happy together. -I know.

56:22.809 --> 56:28.770
So even if it's too late for their wedding anniversary.

56:29.716 --> 56:32.742
You are still going to send it?

56:33.686 --> 56:37.816
Actually I was born before the marriage ceremony.

56:38.925 --> 56:46.764
For a long time, they didn't have enough money to pay for their own wedding.

56:56.442 --> 56:59.536
Natsumi you look so sweet.

56:59.645 --> 57:02.512
I'm such a mess.

57:02.548 --> 57:06.484
Don't say that now you still look cute.

57:10.723 --> 57:15.524
Well.. Enough of that. Turn it off.

57:15.561 --> 57:17.529
Smiling!

57:17.696 --> 57:20.631
-Take a photo. Smile. -True! Smiling!

57:20.666 --> 57:23.601
Where did I put my bag?

57:25.471 --> 57:28.463
It's over there.

57:30.542 --> 57:32.601
Thank you.

58:40.679 --> 58:44.581
Yuri? Are you alright?

58:47.553 --> 58:49.521
Yes.

58:49.555 --> 58:51.716
I'm just imagining things.

58:54.693 --> 58:56.627
Good ...

58:57.663 --> 59:00.564
That's good.

59:13.579 --> 59:15.570
We have no other options.

59:15.614 --> 59:17.548
You're right.

59:28.460 --> 59:30.519
Thank you.

59:30.596 --> 59:32.496
Let's take a look.

59:32.531 --> 59:36.524
I was so right about this place.

59:51.650 --> 59:54.414
Wait.

59:59.691 --> 01:00:03.457
Anyone who enters will be cursed and die.

01:00:03.495 --> 01:00:05.463
I can feel their presence here.

01:00:06.598 --> 01:00:09.533
Kayako.

01:00:11.503 --> 01:00:12.731
Toshio.

01:00:13.539 --> 01:00:15.632
If you say so.

01:00:27.719 --> 01:00:29.448
He ran away.

01:00:29.488 --> 01:00:31.615
Kayako wouldn't do that.

01:00:31.623 --> 01:00:33.614
Right.

01:00:34.626 --> 01:00:37.595
Let's take a look around.

01:00:55.714 --> 01:00:58.512
Over there.

01:01:15.701 --> 01:01:18.499
It's deep.

01:01:18.503 --> 01:01:19.561
We can use it.

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:21.606
Yes, it will work.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.599
-But only as. -Only as a last resort.

01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:36.517
Can you please stop staring?

01:01:37.556 --> 01:01:39.615
What are you doing in there?

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:43.587
The House was calling her. You must warn her.

01:01:46.231 --> 01:01:51.134
You must stay away from this house.
You will die if you go in.

01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:05.208
Mother ... Have you heard of the missing schoolboys?

01:02:05.216 --> 01:02:09.312
Yes, we heard about it. It looks like they are children who live around here.

01:02:10.054 --> 01:02:11.180
Right.

01:02:11.222 --> 01:02:15.215
There were some boys in front of that old House yesterday afternoon.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.026
They were exactly four of them.

01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:21.222
Maybe it was them.

01:02:23.234 --> 01:02:28.103
I think they just ran away. I'm sure they will be found soon.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.041
I do hope so.

01:02:34.345 --> 01:02:37.280
The dinner was really good.

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:16.186
What's wrong? Are you OK?

01:03:17.255 --> 01:03:19.314
Yes.

01:03:21.292 --> 01:03:24.193
I'm fine.

01:03:33.304 --> 01:03:38.241
Master Kyozo said that he will come to get us in about an hour.

01:03:51.222 --> 01:03:56.159
I wonder why on earth I ended up like this.

01:04:00.098 --> 01:04:02.259
Don't you also wonder?

01:04:03.234 --> 01:04:07.227
Maybe it's better that everybody dies.

01:04:09.107 --> 01:04:11.166
Look, I'm scared as well.

01:04:13.344 --> 01:04:17.212
But I am sure, Master Kyozo will help us.

01:04:24.222 --> 01:04:28.124
I went ahead and did this myself.

01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:32.057
Did what?

01:04:43.107 --> 01:04:46.133
This. (Cursed)

01:04:47.345 --> 01:04:54.308
Morishige got a copy of the cursed video.

01:04:56.154 --> 01:04:58.315
What? But how?

01:04:58.322 --> 01:05:06.229
How do you get it?

01:05:06.297 --> 01:05:09.232
You stole it?

01:05:11.335 --> 01:05:14.031
Yes.

01:05:14.272 --> 01:05:20.040
and just now.. while you were taking a shower...

01:05:27.318 --> 01:05:31.186
I uploaded it on the internet.

01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:38.152
I realized the danger and deleted it right away.

01:05:38.196 --> 01:05:43.031
But many people had already downloaded it.

01:05:43.067 --> 01:05:46.230
And it's already on the internet.

01:05:51.142 --> 01:05:54.236
[Authentic cursed video?]

01:05:55.179 --> 01:05:59.172
Everyone will be killed by the curse.

01:06:04.288 --> 01:06:08.122
Hey, Yuri?

01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:11.287
Will you die with me?

01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:15.060
I don't want to be killed by the curse.

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:19.068
Even if the curse kill others ... We can kill ourselves right?

01:06:19.103 --> 01:06:22.072
Well? Isn't that better?

01:06:22.106 --> 01:06:25.166
Natsumi.. Do you know what you've done?

01:06:25.209 --> 01:06:27.074
We have to get rid of this!

01:06:27.111 --> 01:06:29.079
Come on ...

01:06:29.113 --> 01:06:33.072
-Let's die together ... -Natsumi!

01:06:39.157 --> 01:06:42.183
You won't die with me?

01:06:44.061 --> 01:06:46.188
Natsumi ..

01:06:58.142 --> 01:07:01.111
Natsumi!

01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:04.079
Natsumi open the door!

01:07:04.182 --> 01:07:06.150
Natsumi!

01:07:06.184 --> 01:07:09.119
I don't want to do it alone.

01:07:09.153 --> 01:07:11.314
So watch me die!

01:07:15.092 --> 01:07:20.223
Natsumi! Open The Door! Natsumi! Please Stop!

01:07:20.264 --> 01:07:27.067
Natsumi! Natsumi! Listen to Me! Natsumi, Kumohon! Natsumi!

01:07:27.104 --> 01:07:29.163
Natsumi!

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.041
Natsumi, don't! Please, Stop right now!

01:07:35.146 --> 01:07:39.207
Natsumi! Natsumi!

01:08:02.106 --> 01:08:04.131
Natsumi!

01:08:06.043 --> 01:08:09.069
Natsumi! Natsumi!

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:12.081
Natsumi! Get out of there!

01:08:16.187 --> 01:08:19.054
Natsumi, out!

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:21.081
Natsumi, run!

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.219
Natsumi, get out of there!

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:04.157
Suicide isn't possible.

01:09:04.234 --> 01:09:08.136
You see how Horiryu San and the others died.

01:09:08.171 --> 01:09:11.335
All those who try to hinder Sadako's curse is killed.

01:09:12.143 --> 01:09:16.078
And the cursed killing themselves is no different.

01:09:16.113 --> 01:09:19.104
We can't do anything about the Internet.

01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:23.277
This is all my fault ...

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:30.151
With Natsumi.. And everything ...

01:09:30.194 --> 01:09:35.131
You tears are useles, Sadako's curse will still spread.

01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:40.069
So there is no way to completely end the curse?

01:09:42.839 --> 01:09:47.674
Sadako's curses are all linked with an invisible thread.

01:09:49.845 --> 01:09:55.910
I understand ... Then having you cursed may put an end to Sadako's power.

01:09:56.753 --> 01:09:58.846
If it could spread like a vaccine..

01:09:58.889 --> 01:10:02.689
And completely neutralize all her curses.

01:10:13.804 --> 01:10:16.796
I want to help.

01:10:17.808 --> 01:10:20.777
To end the curse plague.

01:10:22.779 --> 01:10:25.646
We'll do it tomorrow night.

01:10:25.682 --> 01:10:28.674
At the time of death that has been predicted.

01:10:28.952 --> 01:10:30.817
Kyozo ..

01:10:30.821 --> 01:10:33.847
That schoolgirl may be in grave danger.

01:14:06.937 --> 01:14:10.839
Hey ... What are you doing?

01:14:12.843 --> 01:14:15.641
You should go home now!

01:14:34.831 --> 01:14:36.822
-Over there! -Let's go!

01:14:41.671 --> 01:14:43.696
-Suzuka! -Suzuka?

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.798
What's wrong?

01:14:44.841 --> 01:14:46.809
-Suzuka. -I have got you!

01:14:47.811 --> 01:14:49.802
Are you ok?

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.713
What is it? What is it?

01:14:57.721 --> 01:14:59.689
Dad, NO!

01:15:10.934 --> 01:15:13.835
Let's go! Come on go!

01:15:57.781 --> 01:16:00.750
Suzuka! Get out of here!

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:03.776
Suzuka, run! Run!

01:16:30.814 --> 01:16:32.782
No!

01:16:37.887 --> 01:16:40.685
Now we can also use her.

01:16:40.724 --> 01:16:42.692
Don't talk like that.

01:16:42.692 --> 01:16:48.631
Tamao, the only way to save her life is if she cooperates with us against them.

01:16:48.665 --> 01:16:50.690
Yuri.

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.692
You will work with us tomorrow.

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:15.781
It wasn't a dream.

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:18.659
Your parents won't ever return.

01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:26.835
If nothing is done right away, that spirit will soon kill you too.

01:17:26.836 --> 01:17:30.670
You saw Kayako, didn't you?

01:17:30.707 --> 01:17:33.767
The ghost living in that House.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:36.904
Tonight we will confront it with another evil spirit.

01:17:36.946 --> 01:17:40.746
The goal is to destroy both of them.

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:46.815
I was a victim of another demonic curse.

01:17:47.824 --> 01:17:50.918
My curse and your curse will fight.

01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:53.794
It is the only way to save our lives.

01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:56.628
Please think about it.

01:17:56.633 --> 01:17:58.794
Prepare yourselves.

01:17:58.835 --> 01:18:03.772
If nothing is done, you and I will be killed by our curses.

01:18:03.807 --> 01:18:05.741
We need your help.

01:18:05.742 --> 01:18:08.905
I would be happy even though only you survive.

01:18:11.714 --> 01:18:14.808
I hope you join us. I Am Yuri.

01:18:17.921 --> 01:18:21.823
I'm Suzuka.

01:18:26.663 --> 01:18:29.757
Yuri and Suzuka will enter the House together.

01:18:29.799 --> 01:18:31.892
By setting foot into the haunted house

01:18:31.901 --> 01:18:34.734
Yuri will be cursed by the evil spirit Kayako.

01:18:34.771 --> 01:18:37.672
And at the same time, by watching the cursed video inside,

01:18:37.674 --> 01:18:39.767
Suzuka will be condemned by Sadako.

01:18:39.809 --> 01:18:42.835
With you both caught between two powerful but different curses,

01:18:42.846 --> 01:18:46.748
Sadako and Kayako will fight over your souls.

01:18:46.783 --> 01:18:49.843
Consumed by the powerful rival forces of Sadako and Kayako

01:18:49.853 --> 01:18:53.789
I hope that they will both be destroyed.

01:18:55.725 --> 01:18:57.716
You two will be spared.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.887
And the curses will no loger spread.

01:18:59.896 --> 01:19:02.888
That should bring an end to the chaos.

01:19:02.899 --> 01:19:04.890
Do you really think that it will work?

01:19:04.934 --> 01:19:06.697
Yes.

01:19:06.736 --> 01:19:09.796
If everything goes according to plan.

01:19:09.806 --> 01:19:13.742
And if not, I have another idea.

01:19:13.776 --> 01:19:17.644
But if possible, I want to avoid using it.

01:19:19.649 --> 01:19:20.877
You'd better rest for the night.

01:19:20.884 --> 01:19:23.648
We must be ready.

01:19:46.743 --> 01:19:48.677
Sorry, I forgot to ask.

01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:51.874
Suzuka, do you want some tea?

01:19:51.915 --> 01:19:53.849
Yes.

01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:56.717
Thank you so much.

01:20:08.865 --> 01:20:12.699
It's so quiet.

01:20:15.838 --> 01:20:17.897
Yes.

01:20:28.718 --> 01:20:30.686
Yuri ...

01:20:30.853 --> 01:20:33.617
I feel ...

01:20:34.724 --> 01:20:37.659
So afraid.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.803
So do I.

01:20:59.749 --> 01:21:02.877
Watch the video immediately, before they attack.

01:21:02.919 --> 01:21:05.752
I understand.

01:21:05.788 --> 01:21:08.757
If you have no choice, escape through the back door.

01:21:08.758 --> 01:21:10.885
We will be waiting there.

01:21:12.829 --> 01:21:14.820
Off you go.

01:21:15.932 --> 01:21:19.663
-Let's go.

01:21:31.814 --> 01:21:35.875
-See you later. -Okay.

01:21:43.693 --> 01:21:45.718
Yuri, can you hear me?

01:21:45.762 --> 01:21:48.856
-Yes. -Be careful.

01:21:49.799 --> 01:21:53.667
-We will. -Let's go.

01:22:28.871 --> 01:22:32.739
-Put it here.

01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:54.721
It's ready. The video is playing now.

01:22:54.731 --> 01:22:59.634
Suzuka, you have to keep watching, no matter what happens.

01:23:00.636 --> 01:23:02.695
Okay.

01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:31.850
Now! Procede as planned.

01:24:32.929 --> 01:24:34.897
Yes.

01:25:11.567 --> 01:25:14.468
That's strange. There's no reaction.

01:25:14.469 --> 01:25:16.403
No.

01:25:16.438 --> 01:25:18.497
They will come.

01:25:46.368 --> 01:25:48.302
Good.

01:25:58.413 --> 01:26:00.574
That sound...

01:26:01.617 --> 01:26:04.484
Kayako.

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.351
Yuri, now you have to watch the video.

01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:52.423
Tamao, shutdown your conciousness.

01:27:00.575 --> 01:27:03.544
Don't look into Sadako's eyes!

01:27:37.479 --> 01:27:41.506
The're still there. The plan failed! Get out of there!

01:28:02.637 --> 01:28:05.401
We failed.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.468
Sadako!

01:28:36.371 --> 01:28:39.465
You Demon! Here it is!

01:28:55.457 --> 01:28:58.449
Through the back door. Go to the well!

01:29:19.414 --> 01:29:20.574
I'm so very sorry.

01:29:20.615 --> 01:29:24.312
But one of you must be sacrificed.

01:29:24.352 --> 01:29:25.341
What?

01:29:25.387 --> 01:29:30.484
We will make Sadako and Kayako invade the body and soul of one of you.

01:29:30.492 --> 01:29:35.395
Then you'll leap into the well, you will die.

01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:37.489
But they will be locked togeter down there.

01:29:37.499 --> 01:29:39.364
Kyozo!

01:29:39.401 --> 01:29:41.335
You okay?

01:29:41.369 --> 01:29:43.462
Forgive me.  The first plan did not succeed.

01:29:43.472 --> 01:29:45.440
Now they are comming.

01:29:47.476 --> 01:29:52.436
Oh no .. You both have to stay away from the well.

01:29:52.481 --> 01:29:54.346
- Okay  - Yuri.

01:29:54.382 --> 01:29:56.612
You are willing to do it?

01:29:59.588 --> 01:30:04.423
If I choose to die, Sadako will come with me.

01:30:04.459 --> 01:30:08.520
When Sadako comes, Kayako will follow.

01:30:11.366 --> 01:30:13.459
Are you sure?

01:30:15.403 --> 01:30:17.462
But Yuri ..

01:30:28.483 --> 01:30:31.350
Tamao. Get Out.

01:30:31.386 --> 01:30:33.445
Kyozo.

01:31:47.395 --> 01:31:48.521
