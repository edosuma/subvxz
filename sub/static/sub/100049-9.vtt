00:01.420 --> 00:03.420
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...

00:03.420 --> 00:04.830
Lanford: But first, give us help
to close one of ours.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.500
What case?
Annalise Keating.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.670
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

00:08.670 --> 00:09.830
I can't stop!

00:09.830 --> 00:10.920
Help!

00:10.920 --> 00:12.170
Help!

00:12.170 --> 00:14.330
Dr. Michaels: It's called
a subperiosteal hematoma.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.920
I love you, Bon.
You hear me?

00:15.920 --> 00:17.000
You're my whole damn life.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.670
Who ordered you
to kill that man?!

00:18.670 --> 00:19.710
Okay!

00:19.710 --> 00:21.460
Xavier Castillo.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.880
Nate:
What are my options?

00:22.880 --> 00:24.120
We ask for a continuance

00:24.120 --> 00:25.830
to investigate
the Governor's involvement.

00:25.830 --> 00:27.330
News Anchor:
Deceased D.A. Ronald Miller

00:27.330 --> 00:29.080
tried to stop the shooting
from happening

00:29.080 --> 00:31.210
by moving up
Mr. Lahey's transfer time...

00:31.210 --> 00:32.670
You and Annalise?

00:32.670 --> 00:34.170
Get him out now.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.250
Who can tell me
what you all missed?

00:36.250 --> 00:38.040
Fine. Hint.
The Queen did it.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.210
Asher:
There's no body!

00:39.210 --> 00:41.790
She faked her death
and framed Snow White.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.750
Michaela:
I can't find my keys.

00:48.750 --> 00:49.920
Asher:
They're in your hands.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.670
Connor: Hello?
Is the FBI in there?

00:51.670 --> 00:53.880
That joke wasn't funny
the first time.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.790
Everyone chug.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.420
Why do we want
this feeling to end?

00:59.420 --> 01:00.790
Mnh.

01:00.790 --> 01:01.830
I just want
to feel normal.

01:03.540 --> 01:04.960
FBI?

01:04.960 --> 01:06.460
Unh-unh.
Unknown caller.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.620
Maybe it's Peyton
ready for Round 2.

01:09.830 --> 01:12.540
She's lucky I didn't knock out
her fake teeth.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.080
Only 'cause I stopped you.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.880
Can we talk about what happened
right after that?

01:15.880 --> 01:17.500
-No.
-Why don't you just say "yes"?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.620
I'm high, not insane.

01:19.620 --> 01:20.830
Ouch.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.500
Now they're
FaceTiming me.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.670
I'm just gonna answer.

01:28.670 --> 01:29.750
No, don't.

01:29.750 --> 01:30.830
Michaela.

01:30.830 --> 01:32.040
Hello?

01:32.040 --> 01:33.830
Who is this?

01:33.830 --> 01:35.670
Laurel:
It's me, Michaela.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.790
Laurel?
Oh, my God.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.710
A-A-Are we hallucinating?

01:39.710 --> 01:40.880
Just -- Okay, listen.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.000
Are you the mole?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.170
No! It wasn't me,
I swear.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.120
I would never
turn you guys in, okay?

01:45.120 --> 01:47.170
But, obviously,
someone else did.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.750
So, we hitting up
that 3L party later, or what?

01:57.750 --> 01:59.580
The party's
graduates only.

01:59.580 --> 02:02.170
But if you're nice,
I'll let you take me...

02:02.170 --> 02:04.080
"Let me"?
Hmm.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.290
You know that party's not worth
going to unless I'm with you.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.250
I hate all these people.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.500
You're just now
realizing that?

02:11.500 --> 02:12.880
We're smarter, prettier.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.580
It's not fair that they took
all the jobs that we deserve.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.330
At least we all
have each other.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.330
Annalise:
Take your seats.

02:22.670 --> 02:25.620
You're all wondering why
I called you here today.

02:25.620 --> 02:28.500
You passed your final exam.
Tomorrow, you graduate.

02:28.500 --> 02:32.620
But I had to say something
before we part ways for good.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.830
I know
that you all ask yourselves

02:34.830 --> 02:37.580
why I'm still here,
teaching,

02:37.580 --> 02:40.830
considering the hot mess
my life has been

02:40.830 --> 02:42.330
the last three years.

02:44.750 --> 02:48.830
Well, the answer is simple --
you.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.460
No one should be falsely accused
of crimes they didn't commit.

02:56.460 --> 03:00.580
But it happens to people
far worse off than me.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.460
And here's where
you come in.

03:03.460 --> 03:07.500
I teach so that some of you
will make sure

03:07.500 --> 03:12.210
that the justice system
lives up to its name.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.330
Even though I know
that most of you will sell out

03:14.330 --> 03:16.330
and go corporate,

03:16.330 --> 03:22.330
some of you -- the brave ones --
will forge your own path,

03:22.670 --> 03:27.330
a path that doesn't put money
or greed or glory first,

03:27.330 --> 03:29.000
but your clients.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.420
So, think hard about
who you want to be,

03:31.420 --> 03:33.830
because, in 24 hours,
you graduate,

03:33.830 --> 03:36.670
and you'll be free of me...

03:36.670 --> 03:38.080
I want my lawyer.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.620
...free from Middleton...

03:40.620 --> 03:42.330
I need help in here!

03:42.330 --> 03:45.620
...free
from your families.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.920
Bonnie: Asher...

03:46.920 --> 03:52.710
So, whoever you decide to be,
make yourself proud.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.670
-That was a drunk speech.
-Yeah.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.790
That was a "get lost and be
nothing like me

04:12.790 --> 04:14.880
because my life's
a huge disaster" speech.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.170
Annalise gave a speech?

04:16.170 --> 04:17.670
Yeah. She basically told us
to go out into the world

04:17.670 --> 04:19.000
and be good people.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.500
So, it was a drunk speech.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.000
Uh, on that note,
I have gifts.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.170
Ooh!
Tiny puppies?

04:24.170 --> 04:25.670
No. It's better.

04:25.670 --> 04:26.670
Open up.

04:29.750 --> 04:30.880
What is this?

04:30.880 --> 04:32.120
Are we taking
a cooking class, Oli?

04:32.120 --> 04:34.460
-They're shrooms.
-They're psilocybin mushrooms

04:34.460 --> 04:36.000
that can heal
psychic wounds --

04:36.000 --> 04:38.330
you know, like,
from the past 3 years.

04:38.330 --> 04:39.830
Asher:
Or unlock all of the deeds

04:39.830 --> 04:41.120
that we've worked very hard
to bury.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.210
Okay, which is it?

04:42.210 --> 04:43.670
Asher's wrong.
I'm right.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.170
Come on.
It'll be fun...gi.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.790
We're supposed to meet my mom
for dinner soon.

04:48.790 --> 04:50.960
I texted her and told her I was
taking you out for dinner,

04:50.960 --> 04:53.250
and she should just meet us here
tomorrow before the ceremony.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.290
Are we doing this
or what?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.330
Screw it.
Yeah, what the hell?

04:58.330 --> 05:00.330
Bon voyage.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.670
Where are you off to?
The Dean's graduation party.

05:07.670 --> 05:08.790
You taking
the new guy?

05:08.790 --> 05:10.380
What do you want, Frank?
What do you think?

05:10.380 --> 05:13.040
She hasn't returned
my phone calls, either.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.290
And Nate?
You two talk yet?

05:14.290 --> 05:16.250
-Nope.
-That doesn't worry you?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.080
He gets to be angry.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.960
He hasn't been to his apartment
in a week.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.500
Well, maybe
he's with Laurel.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.960
Which ones?

05:23.960 --> 05:26.170
Promise me this isn't all about
breaking up me and Bonnie.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.710
Oh, shut up.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.040
I deserve love, Annalise,
like everyone else.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.330
Bonnie deserves love.

05:34.330 --> 05:37.670
Whether it's with you
isn't up to you or me.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.540
Where are you going?

05:41.540 --> 05:43.500
I told you --
the Dean's graduation party.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.120
I mean,
why the suitcase?

05:46.500 --> 05:47.830
Um...

05:47.830 --> 05:51.330
I'm flying to my mother's
after graduation tomorrow.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.670
Nate:
This is Nate Lahey.

06:23.670 --> 06:24.830
Leave a message.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.420
Tegan: You sign
this continuance,

06:30.420 --> 06:32.170
and the judge will delay
the civil suit

06:32.170 --> 06:34.710
until after
the criminal trial.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.500
Xavier or the Governor's
criminal trial?

06:36.500 --> 06:38.790
Right now, the A.G.'s
still focused on Xavier.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.750
Then, why hasn't he
been arrested?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.540
I thought maybe that was
because of you.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.880
You've been MIA a week.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.250
You didn't make a visit
to Xavier?

06:48.250 --> 06:49.830
Put him in a hole
in some woods?

06:49.830 --> 06:52.500
That's why I left town --
so I wouldn't do that.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.500
Hm.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.920
The arrest warrant
should come down soon.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.540
The A.G.'s just finalizing
the evidence.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.420
Nate?

07:08.330 --> 07:12.920
Call Annalise,
at least to hear her side.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.290
She got under
your skin good, huh?

07:16.330 --> 07:18.080
What does that mean?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.420
Watch your back.

07:26.170 --> 07:27.670
Man: ...and kind of
round out the whole experience

07:27.670 --> 07:30.710
of what we did with urban
foraging, by a full dish.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.920
We're going to take
a warm pan here...
Should we be concerned?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.710
....with a little bit
of shallots and butter again.
No. He's just
a lightweight.

07:34.710 --> 07:35.830
Here are my fiddlehead ferns...
Oliver, are you okay?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.920
I fasted all day
in preparation.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.500
Maybe that's why you're
not feeling anything yet.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.580
I don't think I want to feel
what you're feeling.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.460
Oh, yes, you do.
...that's gonna become

07:44.460 --> 07:46.170
our fiddlehead fern
bacon vinaigrette.

07:46.170 --> 07:48.120
And then we'll poach some eggs
after the break.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.830
Newscaster #1:
Tonight on Channel 14's news,

07:49.830 --> 07:53.250
a murder conspiracy rocks
Middleton University.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.580
At the center is famed
Supreme Court Attorney

07:55.580 --> 07:57.000
Annalise Keating.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.120
More on that and your local
Philadelphia news

07:59.120 --> 08:00.620
at 11:00 p.m. tonight.

08:06.210 --> 08:08.790
Tegan: These are the times
I feel really bad for you.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.830
Why? Because of
the people I have to work with?

08:10.830 --> 08:12.120
Because you don't drink.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.210
It's still early.

08:14.210 --> 08:15.670
Professor Cormicle:
Annalise.

08:15.670 --> 08:17.750
Please introduce me
to your lovely friend.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.080
She's gay, Rufus.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.670
Oh.
Are you two...?

08:20.670 --> 08:23.330
Married and thinking about
buying a camper?

08:23.330 --> 08:24.500
Very much so.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.170
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?

08:26.170 --> 08:27.330
Always.

08:27.330 --> 08:30.500
This is Tegan Price,
my boss from Caplan & Gold.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.460
So you're the one to blame?

08:32.460 --> 08:34.000
You're gonna have to
be more specific.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.830
Annalise here hasn't signed
her new contract with Middleton.

08:37.830 --> 08:40.000
You going full-time
at C&G?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.500
Yeah.
Are you?

08:41.500 --> 08:44.290
I'm not talking
work tonight.

08:44.290 --> 08:48.170
Okay, I get you not wanting
to work with that man, but...

08:48.170 --> 08:50.080
No, listen, I don't know
what I'm gonna do next year.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.710
You mean
at Middleton?

08:52.750 --> 08:53.920
Not C&G?

08:53.920 --> 08:55.170
Annalise, if you're about
to quit on me --

08:55.170 --> 08:56.880
My mother's sick.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.120
And every day I'm not there,
I lose more of her.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.420
So if you want a leave
of absence, I'll sign off on it.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.540
Listen, I don't want to talk
about this tonight, please.

09:03.540 --> 09:05.330
Okay.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.830
But I got a firm
to manage.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.380
That's why they call me
the managing partner...
Mm-hmm.

09:08.380 --> 09:09.620
...and some other names

09:09.620 --> 09:11.120
I don't care to know about.

09:14.290 --> 09:16.330
Damn stiffs got nothing
better to gossip about

09:16.330 --> 09:18.500
than me being
a lesbian?

09:18.500 --> 09:21.120
I doubt they're
gossiping about you.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.080
News Anchor:
Attorney Annalise Keating
is under criminal investigation

09:24.080 --> 09:25.330
once again.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.210
An unknown source
has come forward,

09:27.210 --> 09:31.080
causing the FBI to open
several closed murder cases.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.000
The informant has allegedly
provided new details

09:34.000 --> 09:37.210
about an investigation
called "Operation Bonfire."

09:37.210 --> 09:39.170
The name refers to
the bonfire

09:39.170 --> 09:41.710
the Middleton University
football team held

09:41.710 --> 09:44.170
on the night of the murder
of Ms. Keating's husband,

09:44.170 --> 09:46.080
Sam Keating.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.040
Sources say the FBI now
believes that Wes Gibbins

09:49.040 --> 09:52.670
did not act alone
in Mr. Keating's murder.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.540
Neither the FBI nor Ms. Keating
have responded to our requests

09:55.540 --> 09:57.080
for a statement.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.710
We'll keep you updated on any
arrests made in this case.

10:05.620 --> 10:07.620
This is
the Xavier-Governor tag team.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.380
They leaked some stale-ass
rumors to the news

10:09.380 --> 10:11.250
to hit back at you.
Where's my damn car?

10:11.250 --> 10:13.120
And that "anonymous source"?
Made up.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.500
Otherwise, the FBI would've
arrested you by now.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.830
And I dare them to try.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.170
I'll be right there,
guns-blazing...

10:22.670 --> 10:25.210
What's wrong?

10:25.210 --> 10:26.830
I used to live here.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.580
I never collected
the insurance money.

10:31.580 --> 10:34.040
Sam's sister has it
locked up in court.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.710
You think
she's the informant?

10:41.420 --> 10:43.710
I should've left
a long time ago.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.170
What does that mean?
You're leaving right now?

10:46.170 --> 10:47.420
You can't find her?

10:47.420 --> 10:49.380
-She went to the Dean's party.
-Or she took off.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.670
Annalise is the one with her
name spread all over the news.

10:51.670 --> 10:54.000
If anyone gets to panic here,
it's her.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.290
How do we know
she's not the informant?

10:55.290 --> 10:56.540
Shut the hell up.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.040
She gave a cheesy goodbye speech
this morning.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.080
This could be anyone.
Xavier's making crap up.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.120
Gabriel?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.170
One of you?

11:02.170 --> 11:03.500
Asher:
It's obvious who it is.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.000
Laurel.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.290
Oliver.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.830
I'm sorry,

11:12.830 --> 11:15.460
I know it's not funny.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.460
What's wrong with him?

11:16.460 --> 11:17.750
He took mushrooms.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.790
We all did.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.040
Morons.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.210
They're not working on
the rest of us.

11:21.210 --> 11:22.460
Not true.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.380
I think the panic sped up
my digestion,

11:25.380 --> 11:26.750
and, yeah, it's working.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.170
And I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

11:29.380 --> 11:30.500
I hate you, Oliver.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.580
Find out whatever you can
on Gabriel.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.000
Listen.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.830
We're not
doing this here.

11:42.830 --> 11:45.170
I was being selfish.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.290
You were strong enough
to know the truth.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.670
But I didn't want to
risk losing you.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.540
So I did what
was best for me.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.710
I don't want you
to forgive me.

11:55.710 --> 12:00.620
But I do want you to know,
no matter what happens,

12:00.620 --> 12:02.330
I'll die loving you.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.540
Gabriel.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.210
That's your job
right now.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.460
I take it
you saw the news.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.500
Man: VIP Results.
Good evening.

13:17.670 --> 13:19.830
Who's there?

13:19.830 --> 13:21.000
Nate: It's me.

13:27.380 --> 13:28.710
Come on. Let me in.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.330
Get out of the closet,
Oliver.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.330
And, no, I'm not making
a very obvious gay joke.

13:36.330 --> 13:38.250
Okay, some crazy guy
on the Internet says

13:38.250 --> 13:39.880
that sugar might
speed up the high.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.250
Cookies, OJ...

13:41.250 --> 13:43.040
Are we sure we don't want
to savor this experience?

13:43.040 --> 13:44.170
What are you wearing?

13:44.170 --> 13:45.540
Laurel's mittens.
I always coveted them.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.290
They're so soft.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.620
I've made an
executive decision.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.580
We are going out and staying out
until the ceremony.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.580
-Yes!
-No.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.920
No, given
everyone's state, no.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.250
There are parties happening
all over campus.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.500
I've got my party
gloves on!

13:55.500 --> 13:57.670
Guys, guys, we can have
a party right here!

13:57.670 --> 13:58.790
Mnh-mnh. Not fun.

13:58.790 --> 13:59.960
Listen, I need to
talk to you alone.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.330
I don't care
if the FBI's coming.

14:01.330 --> 14:02.880
That's all the more reason
for us to carpe the diem.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.830
So put your cap and gown on,
'cause we are dancing till dawn.

14:04.830 --> 14:07.460
Connor, get up!

14:07.460 --> 14:09.210
Whoa.

14:09.210 --> 14:12.210
No, no, no, no.
You, too?

14:12.210 --> 14:14.040
Mm-hmm.
Apparently.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.040
You were gone for a week,
so it makes sense

14:25.040 --> 14:27.330
that you'd be with the FBI
the whole time.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.500
Yeah.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.790
I could've
given them these.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.830
Denver's files?

14:41.830 --> 14:43.920
You told me you
destroyed these already.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.460
I lied in case I ever
needed to make a deal.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.580
Too late now.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.500
Anything good in them?

14:51.500 --> 14:53.540
Nothing worse than what
you've actually done.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.250
Me or you?

14:55.250 --> 14:58.040
Or are we not gonna talk
about Miller yet?

14:58.040 --> 14:59.460
Let's talk about it.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.880
That you covered up
your own lie?

15:00.880 --> 15:03.170
That you beat a man to death
with your bare hands.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.040
Frank: Hey.

15:24.620 --> 15:27.040
You got a second to talk?

15:27.040 --> 15:28.500
You think
I'm wearing a wire?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.040
Aren't you?

15:30.040 --> 15:32.880
I killed Miller,
Annalise.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.040
And, yeah,
I can own that.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.670
He was innocent, Nate,

15:35.670 --> 15:38.330
and rather than to know that
and hate yourself,

15:38.330 --> 15:39.710
I tried to help you.

15:39.710 --> 15:42.040
This right here -- you telling
me what's good for me --

15:42.040 --> 15:43.710
makes me wish I went to the Feds
a long time ago.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.580
Then go now. Tell them
everything that I've done --

15:45.580 --> 15:46.920
which is absolutely nothing.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.620
You made all this happen --
Sam, Lila -- all of it.

15:49.620 --> 15:50.790
How is any of that true?!

15:50.790 --> 15:53.040
We were screwing
before Sam met Lila.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.460
I know you like
to forget that,

15:54.460 --> 15:57.000
but there is no damn way
this was all his fault.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.540
Frank: Your dad
wasn't a good guy.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.330
No one likes to hear that
about their parents.

16:01.330 --> 16:06.170
But he took advantage of that
young woman, then killed her.

16:06.170 --> 16:07.380
Why are you
telling me this?

16:07.380 --> 16:10.670
So you realize
you're wrong about him.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.620
I didn't make Sam sleep
with Lila.

16:12.620 --> 16:13.830
Or kill her.

16:13.830 --> 16:14.830
That was him.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.210
You cheated first.
Get out!

16:16.210 --> 16:17.500
'Cause you're afraid
to hear the truth?

16:17.500 --> 16:21.330
The truth is it's me
who's got no blood on her hands!

16:21.330 --> 16:22.420
That's you.

16:22.420 --> 16:23.830
You're the one who acted
like an animal,

16:23.830 --> 16:25.670
even when I tried
to save your ass!

16:25.670 --> 16:26.960
Gabriel:
The only reason you're here

16:26.960 --> 16:29.380
is 'cause you know the FBI
is about to arrest you.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.580
How do you know that?

16:34.580 --> 16:36.290
It's all over the news.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.250
Or are you the snitch?

16:38.250 --> 16:40.380
You made the deal
so the FBI doesn't go after you

16:40.380 --> 16:42.500
for killing
your mom's ex?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.330
I don't have a deal.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.460
I tracked your phone,
Gabe.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.620
You were at
the FBI tonight.

16:48.620 --> 16:51.920
It's you. Admit it.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.080
Now you're calling me
an animal?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.380
You're the one who killed
an innocent man.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.620
No, you just got
my pops killed.

16:55.620 --> 16:57.580
Nate!

16:57.580 --> 16:59.830
I did everything I could
to help your father.

16:59.830 --> 17:01.790
And you failed.

17:01.790 --> 17:03.670
The Governor played you.

17:03.670 --> 17:04.750
Get away from me.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.830
My pops was murdered
because of you.

17:06.830 --> 17:07.880
Stay the hell back.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.000
It's time you finally
paid for that.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.330
How? What are you gonna do?
Beat me?

17:11.330 --> 17:13.620
Hmm? Is that what you need
to feel good?

17:13.620 --> 17:14.670
That's what you want,
huh?

17:14.670 --> 17:16.880
I want you out of my life.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.580
So you beat me,
you punch me --

17:18.580 --> 17:21.420
whatever you need to do to feel
like you got one over on me.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.620
Gabriel: I don't know enough
to get a deal with the FBI.

17:27.620 --> 17:30.000
But, clearly,
there's something to know

17:30.000 --> 17:31.210
if you're scared of me.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.960
I never said
I was scared.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.290
But you?

17:37.120 --> 17:38.420
You scared of me?

17:41.170 --> 17:42.960
I just want to know
what happened to him.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.500
Wes killed him.
You know that.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.960
But he didn't do it
alone, though.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.000
So it was you?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.540
You helped him?

17:51.540 --> 17:52.960
Just Wes.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.710
But accuse me again.
Let's see how I react.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.670
You're weak.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.750
Like every other pathetic man
that's ever been in my life

18:06.750 --> 18:10.250
who belittles women and
blames us for their mistakes.

18:10.250 --> 18:14.620
Who cares if Sam
was or wasn't with Lila?

18:14.620 --> 18:16.500
How does it matter?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.170
He had left me
years before that.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.500
That's why I picked you.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.830
Because I knew
I could control you

18:21.830 --> 18:24.500
and that you
would never hurt me.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.880
There's still time.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.540
Or are you just gonna end up
like your father --

18:28.540 --> 18:32.330
broken, alone, and rotting away
in a box until I come --

18:35.620 --> 18:38.960
I wish that
I had killed Sam.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.120
That's how much
I hated the guy.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.500
Maybe killing his son
is the next best thing.

18:52.830 --> 18:56.290
When you go down...

18:56.290 --> 18:58.040
I hope I'm there
to see it.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Alright. Buddy system.
No man left behind.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.380
Connor!

19:30.380 --> 19:33.580
-Oh, nice.

19:33.580 --> 19:36.500
Guys, we're just here
for sugar.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.170
Alright.
Just hang here, then.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.250
Oh, my God.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.330
"Oh, my God."

19:41.330 --> 19:42.670
Sorry, I just...

19:42.670 --> 19:45.080
well, I thought you all
might be somewhere else.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.080
Like jail.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.670
For what?

19:48.670 --> 19:50.290
Beating your ass?
Mm-hmm.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.710
Hey, there's no need
for that, okay?

19:51.710 --> 19:52.920
We're all friends here.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.580
I'll tell Gabriel
you said hi.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.330
Breathe. Deep breaths.
Okay?

19:59.330 --> 20:00.580
Listen, I need to
ask you something,

20:00.580 --> 20:03.920
and it's gonna sound crazy,
but it's actually smart.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.710
Like me.

20:05.710 --> 20:07.170
Like you.

20:07.170 --> 20:09.210
We should get married.

20:09.210 --> 20:11.000
Oh, the mushrooms
are working on you.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.420
No, no, no.
I'm sober as all hell.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.040
And I'm serious.
Okay?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.750
We could get arrested
at any second.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.330
Oli and Connor -- they have
spousal immunity, but we don't.

20:18.330 --> 20:19.830
But spousal immunity
only protects us

20:19.830 --> 20:21.080
from testifying
against each other,

20:21.080 --> 20:22.830
not from whatever the FBI
might have against us.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.460
Yes, but it's better
than nothing, okay?

20:24.460 --> 20:27.210
And I have the $64K to buy you
the ring of your dreams.

20:27.210 --> 20:29.920
So, please say "yes."

20:29.920 --> 20:31.170
Connor:
Say "yes" to what?

20:40.710 --> 20:43.170
Is it you?

20:43.170 --> 20:44.500
No.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.920
Why not?

20:45.920 --> 20:51.920
She framed you for Sam,
now this lie with Ron...

20:52.000 --> 20:53.580
I'd understand.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.540
I can say
the same for you.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.000
If I was gonna turn anyone
into the FBI...

21:03.000 --> 21:05.880
it would be me.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.710
See, this is her --
making you turn on yourself.

21:09.710 --> 21:12.000
She's never
killed anyone, Nate.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.380
That's just us.

21:14.380 --> 21:16.670
And Frank?

21:16.670 --> 21:18.790
What -- you gonna let him
off the hook, too?

21:18.790 --> 21:20.210
I never said that.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.920
Look at me.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.080
And hear me.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.670
I'm worried you think
this is all you deserve.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.120
Maybe it is.
No.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.540
That's just what Annalise

Is the FBI in there?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.250

FaceTiming me.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.920
I'm just gonna answer.

No, don't.

Michaela.

Hello?

23:00.420 --> 23:01.920

23:01.920 --> 23:03.670

It's me, Michaela.

23:03.670 --> 23:05.670
Laurel?
Oh, my God.

23:05.670 --> 23:08.080
A-A-Are we hallucinating?

23:08.080 --> 23:09.290
Just -- Okay, listen.

23:09.290 --> 23:10.290
Are you the mole?

23:10.290 --> 23:11.460
No! It wasn't me,
I swear.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.380
I would never
turn you guys in, okay?

23:13.380 --> 23:15.500
But, obviously,
someone else did.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.040
How do you know about
any of this?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.170
I saw the news.

23:18.170 --> 23:19.540
How?
W-Where are you?

23:19.540 --> 23:21.040
Listen, I can't say in case
my brother's listening.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.210
Laurel, you ruined
our lives.

23:22.210 --> 23:23.580
I'm sorry, okay?

23:23.580 --> 23:25.580
But someone who knows
everything turned on you.

23:25.580 --> 23:28.120
And I swear on Christopher's
life it wasn't me.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.000
How do we even know that
Christopher's still alive?

23:31.920 --> 23:33.330
He's right here.

23:33.330 --> 23:34.830
Oh, my God.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.670
Connor: How do we know that the
FBI didn't put you up to this?

23:36.670 --> 23:37.830
They didn't.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.040
But they're who helped
you disappear, right?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.120
Y-You're in
witness protection?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.210
No.

23:41.210 --> 23:42.500
Christopher didn't crawl
out of this house on his own.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.540
Someone had to help you
do all this.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.000
It was Tegan.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.120
-What are you talking about?
-Tegan Price?

23:47.120 --> 23:49.830
I'm not the informant,
I swear. Okay?

23:49.830 --> 23:51.000
Laurel...
We don't believe you!

23:51.000 --> 23:52.210
I love you all.

24:12.540 --> 24:14.500
Newscaster #1:
A murder conspiracy rocks

24:14.500 --> 24:17.500
Middleton University.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.040
News Anchor: The informant has
allegedly provided new details

24:20.040 --> 24:24.920
about an investigation
called "Operation Bonfire."

24:24.920 --> 24:26.380
Annalise: I never got
the damn insurance money.

24:26.380 --> 24:31.120
Sam's sister has got it
locked up in the court.

24:31.120 --> 24:34.670
Tegan: This is
the Xavier-Governor tag team.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.210
Nate:
You made all this happen --
Sam, Lila -- everyone.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.120
Annalise:
How is any of that true?!

24:42.580 --> 24:45.500
I should've left
a long time ago.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.540
News Anchor: Sources say the FBI
now believes that Wes Gibbins

24:48.540 --> 24:52.540
did not act alone
in Mr. Keating's murder.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.830
Nate: When you go down...

24:53.830 --> 24:56.000
I hope
I'm there to see it.

25:18.540 --> 25:21.000
Tegan: This is cellphone of
yours truly, Tegan Price.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.880
Call my office
if it's urgent.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.920
Tegan's not answering.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.380
Maybe she's the mole.
Or Laurel.

25:27.380 --> 25:28.580
Or Annalise.

25:28.580 --> 25:30.040
The goodbye speech,

25:30.040 --> 25:32.290
the whole Snow White and
the murderous Dwarfs exam.

25:32.290 --> 25:33.540
It's her.
She's the informant.

25:33.540 --> 25:35.290
It makes more sense
that it's Tegan --

25:35.290 --> 25:37.000
or Laurel,
or Gabriel.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.460
Gabriel doesn't
know anything.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.830
Laurel wouldn't call us
just to lie.
Or would she?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.170
It's Annalise.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.380
She's doing what she should've
done the night with Sam.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.500
Alright. Fine.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.500
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it's AK.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.670
Why aren't you high?

25:49.670 --> 25:51.000
What?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I could understand you proposing
to me if you were high,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.250
but you said
that you're not.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.120
I told you why --
spousal immunity.

25:56.120 --> 26:00.330
Or you didn't take
the mushrooms because...

26:00.330 --> 26:01.830
it's you.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.670
Stop.

26:03.670 --> 26:06.380
You feel so guilty
that you want to marry me

26:06.380 --> 26:08.880
so I don't go down for whatever
you agreed to testify about

26:08.880 --> 26:10.290
to the FBI.
Oh, my God.

26:10.290 --> 26:11.500
It's not me.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.040
You do keep pointing
the finger at everyone else.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.790
This is how these
stupid leaks work.

26:15.790 --> 26:17.500
They get us all paranoid,
so we turn on each other.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.210
All then, all the hard work
that we did

26:19.210 --> 26:21.000
to have each other's backs,
to be loyal,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
to trust each other --

26:22.000 --> 26:23.290
that goes out the window

26:23.290 --> 26:25.500
the second we all
turn on our own, okay?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.830
We're a family.
You're my family.

26:27.830 --> 26:28.880
I would never...

26:31.120 --> 26:32.920
I wouldn't...

26:32.920 --> 26:35.460
Asher.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.170
Tell us the truth.

26:38.170 --> 26:39.420
Is it you?

26:48.500 --> 26:49.670
Yeah.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.420
Look, the good thing is,

26:56.420 --> 26:58.500
I-I haven't given the FBI
anything concrete yet.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.250
That's -- That's why
they haven't arrested any of us.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.540
Everything we saw
on the news about --

27:01.540 --> 27:03.290
about them thinking that
more than one person

27:03.290 --> 27:05.000
was involved in
Sam's murder?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.750
That's all stuff that
they suspected before.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.540
I promise,
I never got anyone on record

27:09.540 --> 27:10.830
saying anything ac--

27:23.580 --> 27:25.080
Why did you do that?

27:25.080 --> 27:26.170
I promise,
I never got anyone on record

27:26.170 --> 27:28.210
saying anything ac--

27:30.670 --> 27:32.120
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.210
Connor: Someone check
if he's dead.

27:33.210 --> 27:34.290
You check!

27:34.290 --> 27:35.380
I-I think we should
call 911.

27:35.380 --> 27:36.880
Then call them!

27:36.880 --> 27:39.000
Uh, my hands are too shaky
to dial.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.710
Connor, take the phone!

27:40.710 --> 27:42.000
I think it was
the mushrooms.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.250
Wait! Wait, wait.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.250
Asher.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.290
Asher?

27:48.290 --> 27:50.500
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

27:50.500 --> 27:51.670
Connor:
I'm calling an ambulance.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.790
No, no, no, no.
I'm good.

27:53.790 --> 27:54.920
I'm good.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.500
Oh, holy moly.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.620
Ohh.
Ugh.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.960
Get a towel.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.500
It's probably a scalp wound.
Those -- Those bleed a lot.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.120
I'm fine.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.420
See?

28:08.420 --> 28:09.920
Oh, I'm fine.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.830
I'm fine.

28:11.830 --> 28:12.920
Ugh.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.540
I kind of deserved that.
No, you didn't.

28:14.540 --> 28:16.000
Don't worry, Ols,
it's just a little blood.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.540
No, I -- I think
there's actually a lot.

28:17.540 --> 28:18.380
The cut doesn't
look that big.

28:18.380 --> 28:19.540
Are you sure?

28:19.540 --> 28:21.790
-Let me see.
-Oh, geez.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.000
Okay, he's gonna
need stitches.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.330
Okay, we're gonna
take you to the ER.

28:24.330 --> 28:25.670
No.
Please, just sit down, okay?

28:25.670 --> 28:26.830
Just let me explain.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.040
No, you chose yourself --
I understand.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.830
I chose my Mom
and Chloe, okay?

28:29.830 --> 28:32.420
I had to.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.580
Asher: I thought about
killing myself.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.040
So,
where's your apology

28:36.040 --> 28:37.830
for turning your back
on your only son?

28:37.830 --> 28:39.420
The only way to Heaven

28:39.420 --> 28:42.670
is to beg forgiveness
for your sins.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.500
You can pray to God
all you want.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.170
You're the one
going to Hell, not me.

28:58.710 --> 29:01.500
Lanford:
Nice to see you again, Asher.

29:03.210 --> 29:04.540
What the hell is this?

29:04.540 --> 29:05.920
There's no need to panic.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.830
Just hear them out, Ash.

29:07.830 --> 29:08.830
You were part of this?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.620
They had no choice
but to help us.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.960
Help you do what?

29:15.960 --> 29:17.250
They were gonna put
my mom in jail.

29:17.250 --> 29:18.920
For what?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.500
My dad stole all this money
when he was a judge,

29:20.500 --> 29:22.170
and she knew about it.

29:22.170 --> 29:23.540
They can't charge your mom
for that.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.790
The FBI can do
whatever they want.

29:25.790 --> 29:26.790
Asher:
This was all a ploy.

29:26.790 --> 29:28.670
You didn't actually
want me back.

29:28.670 --> 29:29.670
Of course we did.

29:29.670 --> 29:30.920
He just admitted
this was a trap!

29:30.920 --> 29:32.460
They told us what those people
got you involved in,

29:32.460 --> 29:35.880
that you could all go
to jail for murder.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.380
I'm a lawyer now.
I can fix this.

29:38.380 --> 29:40.540
Asher, look here...

29:40.540 --> 29:42.540
I want to get better,

29:42.540 --> 29:45.460
and you and Chloe are
the only ones in the world

29:45.460 --> 29:46.830
that make me better.

29:46.830 --> 29:48.790
So, please,
I will do whatever I can

29:48.790 --> 29:51.920
to make things right
for us.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.040
-It's too late.
-It's not.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.880
Just listen to what
they have to say.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.040
They want
what's best for us.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.880
Please say "yes,"
baby brother.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.500
Please.

30:06.330 --> 30:07.540
Please.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.290
You came to me that night.
You said you hated them.

30:11.290 --> 30:12.380
I was in shock.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.420
You also told me
you loved me.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.210
I do love you.

30:15.210 --> 30:16.540
They're not my family.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.790
You are.

30:17.790 --> 30:19.620
I'm still in love with you,
Michaela.

30:19.620 --> 30:20.880
I always will be.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.460
When are you
gonna stop lying?!

30:24.460 --> 30:25.920
We had sex!
Was that part of it, too?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.120
No, I -- I meant every single
word I said to you that night.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.460
But you were wearing
a wire the whole time?

30:30.460 --> 30:32.960
I never wore a wire.
I-I just --

30:32.960 --> 30:34.960
I pressed "record"
on my phone sometimes.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.670
Now I'm gonna hit you
in the head.
Like that's any better!

30:36.670 --> 30:38.920
Oh, my God.
That's why you brought up Sam

30:38.920 --> 30:40.830
during our restorative
justice case.

30:40.830 --> 30:42.500
I think seeing my mom

30:42.500 --> 30:44.580
brought everything back for me,
everything we've done.

30:44.580 --> 30:45.670
-Stop.
-Don't do this.

30:45.670 --> 30:46.750
I just --
I still don't even know

30:46.750 --> 30:48.250
what you all did exactly
to Sam.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.460
Michaela: Okay, that's it.
I'm gonna go upstairs to study.

30:50.460 --> 30:52.290
Agent Lanford was
pressuring me for something.

30:52.290 --> 30:53.880
I -- I had to make it
look like I was trying.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.250
You could've told us!

30:55.250 --> 30:57.210
I promise I never recorded
any of you saying anything

30:57.210 --> 30:58.830
they could use against you.

30:58.830 --> 31:00.750
How are we supposed
to believe anything
you're saying right now?

31:00.750 --> 31:02.380
I kissed you
so that you wouldn't

31:02.380 --> 31:03.500
give them anything,
Michaela.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.880
What?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.210
Gabriel said mean things to
you, and now you feel bad.

31:06.210 --> 31:08.250
And we did things to him,
Asher.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.290
He came here to find out things
about his father --

31:10.290 --> 31:13.420
his --
his father, who I...

31:13.420 --> 31:15.120
I mean, it's our fault.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.250
What the hell?

31:16.250 --> 31:18.000
Listen, you can trust me!

31:18.000 --> 31:19.080
We don't.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.460
I'm your best chance
of not going to jail.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.210
Oh, great. Then we might as well
kill each other now.

31:22.210 --> 31:23.250
They don't want us!

31:23.250 --> 31:24.290
They sent you after us.

31:24.290 --> 31:25.420
They want Annalise!
Okay?

31:25.420 --> 31:27.960
They know everything --

31:27.960 --> 31:30.170
Sam, Sinclair, Miller.

31:30.170 --> 31:31.420
The only reason
they haven't arrested us

31:31.420 --> 31:33.920
is because
they don't want the Dwarfs.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.880
They want the queen.
That's AK.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.920
And she preyed on us.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.040
You sound like
every other horrible

31:38.040 --> 31:39.120
straight white man
in this country.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.420
Like father,
like son.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.000
We weren't these people
when we got to law school.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.500
You ran over Sinclair,
not Annalise.

31:43.500 --> 31:44.620
She was the one
that caused that.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.330
Oh, yeah?
It was her foot on the pedal?

31:46.330 --> 31:48.170
She's the one
who leaked the corruption stuff

31:48.170 --> 31:49.790
about my dad
to the Attorney General!

31:49.790 --> 31:51.040
That's why
he killed himself.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.670
The FBI told you that.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.000
They showed me proof.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.920
It was Annalise, okay?

31:56.920 --> 32:01.460
And even if you don't
believe that...the FBI does.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.170
So I didn't have a choice.
And now neither do you.

32:04.170 --> 32:06.080
-How is that even true?
-They didn't come to us.
-What are you talking about?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.960
We can go to
the FBI right now,

32:07.960 --> 32:09.460
and you can ask for
the same deal that I got.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.460
They won't
give us that deal.
They will.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.120
Or they want you to trick us
into believing that

32:13.120 --> 32:15.330
so that we confess.
Think!

32:15.330 --> 32:16.670
It's what Annalise
taught us, okay?

32:16.670 --> 32:18.460
It's not about who is
innocent or guilty.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.920
It's about who has
the best story.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.830
And this is the best story --

32:21.830 --> 32:23.500
that we were manipulated
by our professor.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.380
Law students brainwashed
by an evil genius.

32:25.380 --> 32:30.500
That -- That's the story
a jury wants to believe.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.170
She's brilliant.
That's why she got in our heads.

32:32.170 --> 32:34.120
But...

32:34.120 --> 32:37.500
I'm done with her,
and you should be, too.

32:40.830 --> 32:43.120
Save yourselves.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.170
You know that's what
she would do.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.120
Ophelia: You've reached
the Harkness residence.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.460
Ms. Ophelia's out
doing better things.

33:05.460 --> 33:08.040
Leave a message, and I'll be
sure to return your call soon.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.040
Hi, Mama.
It's Anna Mae.

33:12.710 --> 33:14.000
I'm sorry to call so late,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.080
but I have to
reschedule my trip.

33:19.580 --> 33:23.000
I know I promised...

33:23.000 --> 33:26.540
but it's not that --
it's because I'm a bad daughter,

33:26.540 --> 33:30.210
or that I don't love my mama.

33:30.210 --> 33:31.830
It's just that...

33:38.330 --> 33:41.040
I'll call you soon.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.080
Maybe he's right.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.460
You think so?

34:16.460 --> 34:17.960
What choice do we have?

34:23.170 --> 34:27.380
I'm not making
this decision on shrooms.

34:27.380 --> 34:31.620
We have at least two hours
before we have to line up.

34:32.710 --> 34:34.210
Are you kidding me?

34:37.250 --> 34:40.540
I'm graduating.

34:40.540 --> 34:43.620
Because that's who I am --

34:43.620 --> 34:48.250
a brilliant,
come-from-nothing badass boss

34:48.250 --> 34:51.540
who's not gonna let
some stupid boy or the FBI

34:51.540 --> 34:54.330
get in her formidable way.

Oliver: Asher?!

34:56.000 --> 34:57.790
Asher?!

34:57.790 --> 34:59.120
Where is he?

34:59.120 --> 35:01.580
I went to get a fresh towel,
and he's gone.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.580

35:29.580 --> 35:30.790

35:33.380 --> 35:35.960
Yes. I'm ready.

-Where are you?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.460
About to go walk into
the kids' house.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.210
Don't go in.

36:12.210 --> 36:13.750
I need you here
right now.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.880
Frank: I wish that
I had killed Sam.

36:44.880 --> 36:47.000
That's how much
I hated the guy.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Maybe killing his son
is the next best thing.

37:06.210 --> 37:07.330
Hey.

37:32.460 --> 37:33.710
Done. Now what?
