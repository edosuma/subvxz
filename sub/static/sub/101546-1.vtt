[Mrs. O'Brian] You must be--

18:55.395 --> 18:56.744
Lexy, Lexy Collins.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.225
- Please, come on in.
- Oh, thank you.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.835
Oh, God.

19:01.401 --> 19:02.793
Oh.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.534
[Mrs. O'Brian]
Um, put your stuff over there.

19:04.578 --> 19:07.755
- Oh, sure.
- And, um, go join the others.

19:08.669 --> 19:12.020
Oh, I didn't know you were here.

19:12.063 --> 19:15.415
Please,
come and meet your guests.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.680
Christina Weingarten and group,

19:19.723 --> 19:24.380
say hello to your host,
Vincent Miller.

19:26.861 --> 19:30.473
Oh, dear,
you didn't drink your tea?

19:30.517 --> 19:33.128
Oh, um, I did. I...

19:33.172 --> 19:36.175
[soft piano music]

19:36.218 --> 19:38.002
Delicious.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.352
[chuckles]

19:41.789 --> 19:45.096
Mrs. O'Brian,you've done enough this evening.

19:45.140 --> 19:48.187
Please, you can call it a night.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.320
Oh, um,I'll-I'll just finish up here--

19:51.364 --> 19:53.757
Leave it! I insist.

19:53.801 --> 19:54.976
Thank you.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.412
Um...

19:57.457 --> 19:59.241
Everybody have
a good night then.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.590
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.244
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.854
- Dinner was great, thank you.
- Dinner was so good.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.726
Delicious.

20:05.769 --> 20:08.729
Man, don't nobodycook no catfish no more.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.034
Catfish?

20:10.078 --> 20:12.211
It is an acquired taste.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.865
Not everyone appreciates it.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.955
Well, you sound like you knowsome good old Southern cooking,Mr. Miller.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.349
- Can you pass the dressing?
- Don't listen to them.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.959
Thank you.

20:25.006 --> 20:28.879
So... you get freaked outliving next to a funeral parlor?

20:28.923 --> 20:31.230
- I own it.
- [Christina clears throat]

20:31.273 --> 20:32.970
What made you land here?

20:33.014 --> 20:37.845
The 18th Amendment,what we now know as Prohibition.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.240
[scoffs] Come again?

20:41.283 --> 20:44.721
The lodge used to be
an orphanage.

20:44.765 --> 20:49.291
And during Prohibition,
it became a smuggler's dream.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.381
There's 118 miles
between New York Harbor

20:52.425 --> 20:54.078
and the tip of Montauk Point.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.864
The lodge was a rendezvous pointfor foreign liquor ships

20:56.907 --> 20:59.388
supplying the nation's
liquor markets.

20:59.432 --> 21:05.655
Until 1932 when a fire broke outand killed everybody.

21:07.266 --> 21:12.575
Okay. So, I'm stilla little lost on the here part.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.143
My family buried
most of the dead that year.

21:16.449 --> 21:21.062
And we converted the lodge
into a funeral home.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.238
It's been in my family
ever since.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.806
Sounds like a story
that needs telling.

21:26.676 --> 21:27.851
Cheers to that.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.637
No, please. I'm fine, thank you.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.334
Anybody else? Please.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.989
[all chuckling]

21:35.032 --> 21:37.818
The size of the house
is misleading from outside.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.689
It's a very old building.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.038
The lighting and the shadows

21:41.082 --> 21:44.607
can play tricks with your mind,Cosmo.

21:44.651 --> 21:47.349
Well, let us know.

21:47.393 --> 21:51.266
- Wh... Are there any ghosts?
- [laughing]

21:51.310 --> 21:53.181
- Right, come on.
- Stop.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.443
With everybodythat died in the fire

21:54.487 --> 21:55.836
and living next toa funeral parlor,

21:55.879 --> 21:58.360
- I mean, come on.
- Not that I'm aware of.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.579
[Christina] You're ridiculous.

21:59.622 --> 22:03.844
I... I seen't a ghost one time.

22:03.887 --> 22:07.674
My hometown
is Wallace, North Carolina.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.676
That's where my family house is.

22:09.719 --> 22:13.680
And, you know,
I seen't a ghost there.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.422
I had to get out...

22:17.510 --> 22:19.207
It's such a small town,

22:19.250 --> 22:22.297
everybody seemed to be
backwards and stuck.

22:22.341 --> 22:26.432
Everything just
seemed stuck, yeah.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.043
I had to go.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.219
Wallace, you say.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.743
It's near Burgaw.

22:33.787 --> 22:36.050
Yes-yes, sir, it is.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.271
I spent some time in Burgaw.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.230
[Ottis] Really?

22:46.800 --> 22:51.326
Well, thank you for allowing meto be a part of your show.

22:52.849 --> 22:56.244
I'm opening my doors
to you all to film here,

22:56.287 --> 22:58.551
contributing to your cause,

22:58.594 --> 23:02.642
by letting you stay here
and by feeding you.

23:02.685 --> 23:06.428
In return, I have a few things.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.561
The interviewing
will be done at night.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.911
My schedule during the day
is full,

23:10.954 --> 23:14.001
and I do not wish
to complicate things.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.530
[Vincent VO]
Why so deep in thought child?

23:21.574 --> 23:24.925
Do you miss your parents,
Nancy?

23:27.493 --> 23:31.018
[normal voice] My mortician,
Randolph, is equally as busy,

23:31.061 --> 23:32.672
and I do not want to bother him.

23:32.715 --> 23:39.679
So, the basement
and the funeral parlor
are off limits.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.124
Due to Mrs. O'Brian's
health condition,

23:50.167 --> 23:54.389
if we have any smokers here,
please use the back patio.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.609
There is also nocellphone service in the house.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.872
- You're joking, right?
- [Cosmo] Huh?

23:58.915 --> 24:01.091
[Vincent]It does not matter the carrier.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.663
Must be the old foundation
or the equipment that we use.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.752
Regardless,
I have a house phone.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.537
I will post the number
next to it.

24:11.580 --> 24:16.455
You are all free to use it,
but please, don't abuse it.

24:20.415 --> 24:23.940
To my Civil War, here, here.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.769
- To your Civil War!
- To your Civil War.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.206
I ain't toasting no Civil War.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.690
Come, let me show you
the rest of the home

24:34.734 --> 24:38.041
and show you
where to drop your things.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.087
You said smoking's
out on the back porch?

24:40.130 --> 24:43.699
Ottis, let's finish
setting up first, yeah?

24:43.743 --> 24:45.658
Smoke later.

24:45.701 --> 24:48.530
I need to take everything in,
boss.

24:48.574 --> 24:53.187
I need a few minutes for me.
[sighs]

24:53.230 --> 24:56.756
Can I...
Can I borrow that lighter?

24:56.799 --> 25:02.239
Man, why in the hell
did you take this job?

25:02.283 --> 25:05.895
Bringing me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.986
Yeah, yeah, it's important work,

25:10.030 --> 25:13.816
but at least I wouldn't be
out in the middle of nowhere.

25:13.860 --> 25:17.254
Goddamn. Eating this nasty food.

25:17.298 --> 25:20.910
What is up
with white people and spices?

25:24.523 --> 25:27.134
I was thinking this room
could work for you, Christina.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.137
It's right for the interview.

25:32.443 --> 25:33.749
What do you think?

25:33.793 --> 25:36.665
[soft chuckle] Wow.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.580
This room is...

25:40.277 --> 25:42.410
It's totally perfect.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.588
The decor is stunning.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.722
My cousin, Clyde,
has impeccable taste.

25:49.765 --> 25:54.814
Most of this furniture
was left behind
by previous family members.

25:54.857 --> 25:58.078
The basement, although,
is still messy.

26:02.430 --> 26:03.866
I like it.

26:05.302 --> 26:08.654
No refrigerator noise,
no air conditioner.

26:08.697 --> 26:11.134
Perfect for sound.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.049
Yes it is, Scratch.

26:13.093 --> 26:14.877
This is one of the quiet rooms.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.706
It's a special place
where I like to sit and read.

26:17.750 --> 26:21.536
It has a cool vibe. Very trendy.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.148
- So amazing.
- Thank you, Janet.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.629
But again,
my cousin Clyde has the eye.

26:32.547 --> 26:36.420
Through there is another roomwith its own unique look.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.344
[crickets chirping]

26:47.388 --> 26:49.608
Think this lighter is goin' out.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.350
[whispers] Shit...

26:55.744 --> 26:57.703
It's a nice lighter.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.098
Maybe his granddaddy
passed it down.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.360
It was probably antique.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.014
They don't make 'em
like this no more.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.976
I am sure
you don't want this room.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.936
Are those caskets?

27:13.980 --> 27:17.679
Yes, this is the casket room
leading to the office
and the parlor.

27:17.723 --> 27:21.901
I like how everything
looks old and dated.

27:21.944 --> 27:25.469
Well, I believe if you like
something, keep it,

27:25.513 --> 27:27.254
no matter the era.

27:28.821 --> 27:31.562
But again,
it's my cousin Clyde's eye.

27:36.742 --> 27:40.702
My cousin is
obsessed with the basement.

27:40.746 --> 27:44.619
He found this
and wanted to set it all up.

27:49.842 --> 27:52.975
This was an actual doctor's roomfor the orphanage.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.498
Whoa, really?

27:54.542 --> 27:56.892
That's creepy.

27:56.936 --> 27:59.547
This is the only room
in the house without a bed,

27:59.590 --> 28:04.117
so if anyone
would like to camp out.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.123
Have an adventure.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.081
[clears throat]

28:12.125 --> 28:13.604
There is a room adjacent
to this one

28:13.648 --> 28:15.868
with plenty of powerif you'd like to see if it works

28:15.911 --> 28:18.609
- for your makeup station.
- Sweet.

28:18.653 --> 28:19.654
Please.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.839
[Ottis] Man, come on.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.191
You gotta
get a signal somewhere.

28:42.285 --> 28:47.116
So, Christina,
now that Nancy approves,
shall we begin?

28:48.509 --> 28:50.772
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.644
- Um--
- Please, call me Vincent.

28:53.688 --> 28:57.692
I actually don't think
that we're going to be ready
until about after...

28:57.736 --> 28:59.694
Forgive me.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.523
You all traveled in today.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.351
You must be very tired.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.788
Tomorrow.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.356
And you need time to setup so...

29:09.399 --> 29:10.444
I'm out most of the day.

29:10.487 --> 29:13.012
Let's plan on a 7:00 p.m. start.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.578
[Christina] That works.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.537
[Vincent] Great.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.845
Okay, so what we'll do
is we can put him here.

29:19.888 --> 29:23.457
And I'm thinking the camera
can be here.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.720
But I like this fireplace.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.984
Vinny, if we blow a fusewhere's the electric box,the basement?

29:30.464 --> 29:35.904
Oddly, it's in the kitchen,and please, call me Vincent.

29:35.948 --> 29:40.256
[Vincent VO]
Ottis, go back to Wallace.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.999
Sweet sister Sadie.

29:48.003 --> 29:51.659
Oh, I... I see.

29:52.442 --> 29:53.792
Ottis!

29:56.359 --> 29:58.274
Oh, man, you good!

29:58.318 --> 30:01.451
You 'bout scaredthe piss out of my ass!

30:01.495 --> 30:04.193
Yo, Aunt Ney
is gonna here about this!

30:05.891 --> 30:08.371
Hey, come on, man,
I need my lighter back!

30:11.070 --> 30:13.202
[tense organ music]

30:18.686 --> 30:20.644
Ah... okay.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.873
Hey, either one of you
soldier boys got a cigarette?

30:34.397 --> 30:35.790
Hey.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.444
Yo, my dude.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.707
You got a cigarette?

30:41.927 --> 30:43.624
Yo, my dude.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.235
What the...?
[groaning]

30:56.680 --> 30:58.291
Cosmo...

30:58.726 --> 31:00.119
Cosmo...

31:00.162 --> 31:01.511
[Cosmo] Ottis!

31:03.557 --> 31:04.732
Ottis, you still out here?

31:04.775 --> 31:07.256
Cosmo, Cosmo...

31:07.300 --> 31:09.084
There goes my lighter.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.405
[sighs]

31:27.233 --> 31:28.930
Did everything fit in the bag?

31:28.974 --> 31:31.063
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:31.106 --> 31:34.544
I don't want Christina to know
we're going behind her back
on this one.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.633
Hey, where'd you find Ottis?

31:36.677 --> 31:37.939
Aunt Ney recommended him.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.288
- No shit.
- Yeah.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.463
Fucking Christ, thank God

31:40.507 --> 31:42.248
this is a documentary, right?

31:42.291 --> 31:44.467
If we were shootin' a feature
I would be screwed.

31:46.339 --> 31:49.081
Hey, so what's the plan?

31:49.124 --> 31:54.651
The last place
Lana Hill was actually seen
was the funeral parlor.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.784
So I figure we start
from the bottom up.

31:56.827 --> 31:58.699
Check out the basement
and then...

31:59.656 --> 32:01.702
tomorrow, while we're shooting,

32:01.745 --> 32:04.052
one of us will
bug out and check out
the funeral parlor.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.098
All right.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.664
Does the air feel different?

32:07.708 --> 32:10.102
- The air?
- Yeah, the air.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.277
It feels...

32:12.669 --> 32:14.802
- thick.
- [chuckles]

32:14.845 --> 32:17.848
Hey, so I got this source
at the network,

32:17.892 --> 32:21.940
says he'll pay us
a lot of money if we find
anything else on Lana.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.158
Fine.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.164
Hey!

32:29.208 --> 32:31.340
Uh, did you guys
need anything else?

32:32.037 --> 32:33.777
I think I'm good.

of the entire Civil War
was 620,000.

were South Carolina, Florida,
Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,

North Carolina, and...

48:06.448 --> 48:08.146
The great state of Tennessee.

48:09.321 --> 48:12.715
Home of my great-grandfather.

48:12.759 --> 48:15.544
It was during this time
that John Wilkes Booth
up in the north

48:15.588 --> 48:19.461
came up with a planwith his associates,including my great-grandfather,

48:19.505 --> 48:22.638
to kidnap the
President of the United States

48:22.682 --> 48:26.947
and bring him down
to the Confederate capitol
in Richmond.

48:26.991 --> 48:29.210
To bring him through the tunnelsof the White House

48:29.254 --> 48:30.603
like you said before.

48:30.646 --> 48:32.474
- [static buzzing]
- Yes.

48:32.518 --> 48:34.520
Lincoln had underground
secret tunnels

leading from Washington, D.C.
down to the heart of Dixie.

48:37.349 --> 48:39.960
Some say that Lincoln
had them built.

48:40.004 --> 48:43.964
Others say that they werepre-built by John Adams in 1801.

48:44.008 --> 48:47.794
The tunnels led
from Washington, D.C.

48:47.837 --> 48:53.626
all the way down to a small farmin Port City, North Carolina,

48:53.669 --> 48:57.064
the site of one of the biggestbattles the South had ever seen,

48:57.108 --> 48:58.544
also one of the bloodiest.

48:58.587 --> 49:01.242
So Washington
must have had them built.

49:01.286 --> 49:06.204
No, Washington never set foot
in Washington, D.C.
or the White House

49:06.247 --> 49:09.990
as he died
while the capitol was still
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

49:10.034 --> 49:13.776
But out of respect, the districtwas named after him.

1:02:24.088 --> 1:02:26.699
How about we
take the pictures from Lexy

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:28.962
and roll them together...

1:02:30.268 --> 1:02:32.400
with the synopsis and...

1:02:32.444 --> 1:02:35.229
Look, why don't wejust cut our losses

1:02:35.273 --> 1:02:37.318
and cut this showfrom the segment?

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:41.670
Okay.
You know, I'm really tired

1:02:41.714 --> 1:02:44.848
and maybe I'll just take a nap.

1:02:44.891 --> 1:02:46.414
I wanna leave.

1:02:46.458 --> 1:02:48.852
This-this place
is freaking me out.

1:02:48.895 --> 1:02:52.333
Vincent... I don't know,let's just go.

1:02:53.682 --> 1:02:56.120
Did something happen?

1:02:56.163 --> 1:02:59.688
Everyone seems pretty tense.

1:02:59.732 --> 1:03:02.169
Go to your makeup room,
lollipop.

1:03:02.213 --> 1:03:03.388
Chris.

1:03:07.522 --> 1:03:08.959
What the hell?

1:03:09.002 --> 1:03:12.701
I did not shoot500 photos with the lens cap on.

1:03:12.745 --> 1:03:14.660
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:03:14.703 --> 1:03:16.357
[keys clicking]

1:03:16.923 --> 1:03:18.185
[scoffs]

1:03:20.666 --> 1:03:22.276
[static buzzing]

1:03:48.607 --> 1:03:50.478
[static buzzing]

1:04:00.967 --> 1:04:03.578
[laughing]

1:04:06.277 --> 1:04:07.452
[gasps]

1:04:08.975 --> 1:04:10.672
[Cosmo] Lex!

1:04:10.716 --> 1:04:11.978
Lex!

1:04:12.892 --> 1:04:13.980
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:04:14.024 --> 1:04:16.765
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

1:04:16.809 --> 1:04:18.419
- Yeah, we do.
- You all right?

1:04:18.463 --> 1:04:19.768
- No.
- Come on. What's going on?

1:04:19.812 --> 1:04:21.292
No, there was a thing in there.

1:04:21.335 --> 1:04:22.423
What thing, what happened?

1:04:22.467 --> 1:04:23.816
I don't knowwhat the fuck it was!

1:04:24.425 --> 1:04:26.863
- Lex!
- What?

1:04:26.906 --> 1:04:31.476
Okay, this looks likea typical... a typical basement.

1:04:31.519 --> 1:04:33.565
This doesn't feel right.
The basement is a bad idea.

1:04:33.608 --> 1:04:35.784
He had something to do
with Lana Hill going missing.

1:04:35.828 --> 1:04:37.917
Richard and Carol
will figure it out
when they get here.

1:04:37.961 --> 1:04:39.571
Okay, if he had
something to do with it,

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:41.660
then we'd be able to
find something down here then.

1:04:41.703 --> 1:04:44.663
He doesn't cast
a reflection in a mirror.

1:04:44.706 --> 1:04:47.448
Can we just...

1:04:47.492 --> 1:04:50.408
Can we just say
what needs to be said here?

1:04:50.451 --> 1:04:51.844
He's a fucking vampire.

1:04:51.888 --> 1:04:54.978
[laughing] A vampire?

1:04:55.021 --> 1:04:57.328
- Lex--
- That sounds
totally ridiculous.

1:04:57.371 --> 1:05:00.505
Did you just... Did you hearwhat just came outta your mouth?

1:05:00.548 --> 1:05:04.204
Okay, Seth, a vampire?

1:05:04.248 --> 1:05:06.206
- Hey, there's a jukebox.
- Lex.

1:05:06.250 --> 1:05:08.861
Al Jolson.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:10.036
Uh...

1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:12.517
"Happy Days Are Here To Stay."

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:15.694
Damn, these records are old.

1:05:17.783 --> 1:05:19.872
Whoa, did you feel that?

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.091
It's like déjà vu.

1:05:21.134 --> 1:05:22.831
Déjà vu.

1:05:24.355 --> 1:05:25.530
What?

1:05:25.573 --> 1:05:27.184
Déjà vu.

1:05:28.054 --> 1:05:29.534
It's him.

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:33.451
He has been fucking with us.

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:39.457
I know who...

1:05:40.545 --> 1:05:42.199
or what you are.

1:05:48.422 --> 1:05:50.511
You got me, Cosmo.

1:05:50.555 --> 1:05:54.951
You're right, I am a vampire.

1:05:54.994 --> 1:05:57.997
[laughing]

1:05:58.041 --> 1:05:59.259
See, Lex.

1:06:00.304 --> 1:06:02.132
I told you.

1:06:02.175 --> 1:06:04.003
Seth.

1:06:04.047 --> 1:06:05.613
What are you doing?

1:06:05.657 --> 1:06:08.660
I've been chasing missing peoplefor a long time.

1:06:09.791 --> 1:06:11.837
After a while,you develop a knack

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:15.493
for identifying those
who stick out.

1:06:15.536 --> 1:06:19.236
Let me guess,
your Civil War story,

1:06:19.279 --> 1:06:21.978
- that's not your grandfather.
- Mm...

1:06:22.021 --> 1:06:23.414
It's you.

1:06:23.457 --> 1:06:24.937
The skin condition, the air.

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:27.070
Very bright, Cosmo.

1:06:27.113 --> 1:06:29.028
Once again, you are correct.

1:06:29.072 --> 1:06:33.293
I am Dr. Vincent J. Miller.

1:06:33.337 --> 1:06:35.556
Those whack-a-do's upstairs,

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:37.167
fussing around
with their equipment,

1:06:37.210 --> 1:06:39.430
trying to figure out
why they can't figure you out.

1:06:39.473 --> 1:06:43.390
- But we know why, don't we?
- Oh, we sure do, Cosmo.

1:06:43.434 --> 1:06:45.610
Who are you talking to?

1:06:45.653 --> 1:06:47.046
Cosmo.

1:06:48.265 --> 1:06:50.615
Seth, what are you doing?

1:06:53.487 --> 1:06:55.185
Let's have a drink, shall we?

1:06:57.578 --> 1:07:01.365
This is a very fine Kentucky
straight bourbon whiskey.

1:07:02.757 --> 1:07:05.021
It's rather old though.
I personally snatched it

1:07:05.064 --> 1:07:07.458
from General Grant's
headquarters.

1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:13.594
Very smooth.

1:07:28.783 --> 1:07:30.002
Don't spill it.

1:07:37.140 --> 1:07:40.534
Here's to 14 years
of being on the wagon.

1:07:40.578 --> 1:07:45.191
No, here's to being liberated
after 14 years.

1:07:45.235 --> 1:07:48.499
I was liberated at the end
of the Civil War

1:07:48.542 --> 1:07:50.544
by the woman who would
alter my life forever.

1:07:50.588 --> 1:07:52.677
[Lexy] Hello!
[clapping and snapping]

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:54.679
Wake up, what are you doing?

1:07:56.985 --> 1:07:58.639
Have you been drinking?

1:08:02.904 --> 1:08:04.210
Ahh...

1:08:04.254 --> 1:08:08.084
[breathes deeply]

1:08:08.127 --> 1:08:10.129
Cosmo, what are you doing?

1:08:12.479 --> 1:08:14.916
He's pouring.

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.354
- He's okay.
- Who are you talking to?

1:08:17.397 --> 1:08:18.703
Miller.

1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:29.061
Is that when you
turned into a vampire?

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:31.411
- Yes.
- Seth, what are you doing?

1:08:31.455 --> 1:08:34.936
You do realize that you've put
everyone in grave danger

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:38.026
with your unauthorized
investigation?

1:08:38.070 --> 1:08:40.638
Even your friends,
Richard and Carol,

1:08:40.681 --> 1:08:42.553
who are currently on their way.

1:08:42.596 --> 1:08:43.684
We gotta get outta here.

1:08:43.728 --> 1:08:45.773
Seth, come on, we gotta go!

1:08:45.817 --> 1:08:47.862
You're just trying to get
inside my head.

1:08:49.212 --> 1:08:51.083
You afraid of crucifixes
or some shit?

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:55.870
[laughs]
I was raised Catholic.

1:08:55.914 --> 1:08:59.091
Crucifixes, holy water,
they don't work.

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:01.311
[Lexy] Seth, let's go!

1:09:02.094 --> 1:09:03.791
Garlic, I love garlic.

1:09:03.835 --> 1:09:06.185
Growing in my backyard
as we speak.

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:08.753
Seth! Seth...

1:09:08.796 --> 1:09:14.585
Stake through the heart,hurts like hell, won't kill me.

1:09:14.628 --> 1:09:17.065
Now, silver, mm.

1:09:17.109 --> 1:09:18.197
[Lexy] Come on, we gotta go.

1:09:18.241 --> 1:09:20.286
- That stings.
- [Lexy] Seth!

1:09:20.330 --> 1:09:21.809
Let's go!

1:09:21.853 --> 1:09:23.855
Seth! Seth!

1:09:23.898 --> 1:09:25.726
[grunting]

1:09:25.770 --> 1:09:26.814
No!

1:09:27.424 --> 1:09:28.642
No...

1:09:31.776 --> 1:09:33.125
[gasps]

1:09:34.648 --> 1:09:36.041
Please!

1:09:36.084 --> 1:09:39.262

1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:55.539
Please!

1:10:01.371 --> 1:10:04.112
[screaming]

1:10:29.573 --> 1:10:31.531
[Janet]I didn't know you were in here.

1:10:31.575 --> 1:10:32.793
[mutters]

1:10:32.837 --> 1:10:35.361
[Scratch]
Janet, what are you doing?

1:10:35.405 --> 1:10:36.623
[laughs]

1:10:41.846 --> 1:10:43.195
[water running]

1:10:43.239 --> 1:10:46.154
[Janet]
Oh, shit, there's no soap.

1:10:46.198 --> 1:10:50.071
Scratch, can you hand me
the soap, please?

1:10:50.115 --> 1:10:51.334
[giggles]

1:10:51.856 --> 1:10:53.901
Uh, yeah.

1:10:54.772 --> 1:10:55.947
Sure.

1:11:04.912 --> 1:11:07.828
Here, uh, look up
above the shower curtain.

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:09.787
[Janet] I can't reach that.

1:11:09.830 --> 1:11:13.921
Can you hand it to me
like a gentleman, please?

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:15.836
[giggles]

1:11:22.321 --> 1:11:23.714
There you go.

1:11:23.757 --> 1:11:25.368
Where's the soap?

1:11:25.411 --> 1:11:28.284
- Oh-oh here.
- [giggles]

1:11:29.241 --> 1:11:31.678
It's really hot in here.

1:11:31.722 --> 1:11:33.506
You don't like it steamy?

1:11:33.550 --> 1:11:34.855
[both giggle]

1:11:34.899 --> 1:11:38.250
Not when I can't see you,
that's no fun.

1:11:39.817 --> 1:11:42.820
I didn't think we'd
be doing this right here.

1:11:44.735 --> 1:11:46.302
I can't see you.

1:11:46.345 --> 1:11:47.999
I'm sure if you wanted

1:11:48.042 --> 1:11:51.524
you could reach out
and touch me.

1:11:52.438 --> 1:11:55.354
Janet, it's really hot in here.

1:11:56.877 --> 1:11:57.922

Hello, can you hear me?

1:13:21.658 --> 1:13:23.311
Hello?

1:13:23.355 --> 1:13:26.489

1:13:27.925 --> 1:13:29.883
[child giggles]

[Mrs. O'Brian]
Come on in, sweetie.

1:13:35.759 --> 1:13:39.719
Come on, come on!

1:13:39.763 --> 1:13:41.982
I'm waiting for you.

1:13:42.026 --> 1:13:44.420
It's me.

1:13:44.463 --> 1:13:49.076
It's me. [laughing]

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:04.614
I can hear you.
[laughs]

1:14:04.657 --> 1:14:07.181
I can hear you.

1:14:07.225 --> 1:14:09.923
- [laughs]

1:14:32.729 --> 1:14:34.557
[crickets chirping]

1:14:39.953 --> 1:14:42.913
This is what
you're gonna do, McMahon.

1:14:42.956 --> 1:14:45.132
You're gonna clean up
my investment.

1:14:45.176 --> 1:14:47.831
You're gonna put it
in that machine, see.

1:14:47.874 --> 1:14:50.877
And you're gonna run production as planned.

1:14:53.184 --> 1:14:55.665
Do I make myself clear,
Mr. McMahon?

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:59.277
Because... I won't hesitate.

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.585
I will shoot you right here,
right now.

1:15:02.628 --> 1:15:04.717
Right where you stand.

1:15:04.761 --> 1:15:07.851
-Oh, God.
- Do I make myself clear?

1:15:07.894 --> 1:15:09.592
- Mr...
- I hate this show.

1:15:09.635 --> 1:15:12.638
[laughing]

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:19.427
Nancy,
why do you like such crap?

1:15:19.471 --> 1:15:22.822
It's not crap, it's fun.

1:15:22.866 --> 1:15:25.782
And good morning to you,sleepy head.

1:15:26.391 --> 1:15:27.958
[static buzzing]

1:15:30.526 --> 1:15:33.267
- Hey, where is everybody?
- I don't know.

1:15:33.311 --> 1:15:36.575
I haven't seen anybody since
we wrapped filming hours ago.

1:15:36.619 --> 1:15:38.272
Where's Scratch?

1:15:38.316 --> 1:15:40.144
I think he went upstairsto take a shower.

1:15:41.667 --> 1:15:43.060
It's midnight.

1:15:43.103 --> 1:15:45.279
Why did you let me
sleep so long?

1:15:45.323 --> 1:15:47.151
You said you wanted to sleep.

1:15:47.194 --> 1:15:49.327
Yeah, well,
we gotta get going.

1:15:49.370 --> 1:15:51.416
Okay, let's go.

1:15:52.069 --> 1:15:53.723
[sighs]

1:15:56.769 --> 1:15:57.857
Hey.

1:15:57.901 --> 1:15:59.380
[door banging]

1:15:59.424 --> 1:16:01.426
This is stuck.

1:16:01.469 --> 1:16:03.080
You think Vincentlocked us in here?

1:16:03.123 --> 1:16:04.821
Yeah, okay.

1:16:06.083 --> 1:16:07.345
[gasps]

1:16:09.826 --> 1:16:12.393
That can't be the same door
that we just came in.

1:16:12.437 --> 1:16:14.874
Obviously not.

1:16:16.006 --> 1:16:17.616
This house is so weird.

1:16:17.660 --> 1:16:19.487
I don't know, did we
come through this door?

1:16:19.531 --> 1:16:22.229
Freaking creepy.

1:16:22.273 --> 1:16:25.276
I coulda sworn
we came through this door.

1:16:26.190 --> 1:16:27.365
[knob clicks]

1:16:27.408 --> 1:16:29.759
Oh, come on right now!

1:16:29.802 --> 1:16:33.110
- [banging]
- Christina, just open it!

1:16:37.854 --> 1:16:39.507
Come on!

1:16:40.378 --> 1:16:41.945
[gasps]

1:16:41.988 --> 1:16:43.381
What the fuck?

1:16:43.424 --> 1:16:46.079
Language, but you're right.

1:16:46.123 --> 1:16:47.951
What the fuck?

1:16:51.694 --> 1:16:53.043
Oh, God.

1:16:55.698 --> 1:16:59.615
Grab your phone and let's
get the hell out of here.

1:16:59.658 --> 1:17:00.964
Now.

1:17:05.098 --> 1:17:06.752
This is so weird.

1:17:06.796 --> 1:17:08.101
Let's go.

1:17:11.235 --> 1:17:12.976
Shh, shh, shh.

1:17:14.107 --> 1:17:15.456
Okay.

1:17:19.417 --> 1:17:21.114
- Shh, shh.
- I'm scared.

1:17:21.158 --> 1:17:25.336
Listen, baby,
something is not right here.

1:17:25.379 --> 1:17:27.164
You understand me?

1:17:29.166 --> 1:17:32.604
[Vincent] There the bastard willlead me to the office and Tony.

1:17:34.650 --> 1:17:36.608
- I need you to hide in there.
- No.

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:38.044
- Yeah.
- No.

1:17:38.088 --> 1:17:40.830
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:17:40.873 --> 1:17:42.745
I will not let
anything happen to you.

1:17:42.788 --> 1:17:44.224
You understand me?

1:17:46.096 --> 1:17:47.706
You're gonna have to
hide in there.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:49.360
No, no, no, no, no.

1:17:49.403 --> 1:17:51.144
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- Why?

1:17:52.145 --> 1:17:53.756
- You go in there.
- No...

1:17:53.799 --> 1:17:56.497
Please. Please, Nancy, go.

1:18:11.730 --> 1:18:14.080
Thank you for taking care of us.

1:18:14.124 --> 1:18:16.039
That's what we do.

1:18:16.082 --> 1:18:20.086
I've never been to
a funeral parlor
that's open 24 hours.

1:18:20.130 --> 1:18:24.221
It's odd hours for some,
convenient for others.

1:18:25.135 --> 1:18:26.571
We are the only funeral parlor

1:18:26.614 --> 1:18:28.573
open 24 hours
in the neighborhood,

1:18:28.616 --> 1:18:30.270
in fact, the entire region.

1:18:30.314 --> 1:18:32.490
Mm. I guess business is good.

1:18:32.533 --> 1:18:34.797
We provide value.

1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:38.017
As you can see,
there is a casket
for all types of budgets.

1:18:38.061 --> 1:18:41.281
Usually they select one
based on who the person was

1:18:41.325 --> 1:18:42.761
during the course of their life.

1:18:42.805 --> 1:18:44.632
What type of person
was your father, Richard?

1:18:44.676 --> 1:18:46.547
[Richard] A real piece of work.

1:18:46.591 --> 1:18:48.506
But it's her father.

1:18:48.549 --> 1:18:51.639
Yes, unfortunately he was.

1:18:51.683 --> 1:18:54.686
Look, I just wanna bury the manand move on with my life, okay?

1:18:54.730 --> 1:18:56.557
The man wasn't present
throughout my whole life,

1:18:56.601 --> 1:18:59.169
and he treated my mother
like shit till her death.

1:18:59.212 --> 1:19:00.474
So, it's his turn.

1:19:00.518 --> 1:19:03.260
So, you know what just,
whatever.

1:19:03.303 --> 1:19:05.088
Very sorry to hear that.

1:19:06.002 --> 1:19:07.655
I understand.

1:19:07.699 --> 1:19:09.179
If it's price, we have options.

1:19:09.222 --> 1:19:12.095
No, he left us a ton of money,

1:19:12.138 --> 1:19:14.793
as well as a ton of money
to bury him.

1:19:17.056 --> 1:19:20.233
That one.
Let's just go with that one.

1:19:20.277 --> 1:19:22.496
Four-two-two-nine-eight.

1:19:22.540 --> 1:19:24.455
For the price,
you can't beat it.

1:19:24.498 --> 1:19:26.457
[laughing]

1:19:29.068 --> 1:19:33.420
So how long will we be
laying Fred out for viewing?

1:19:33.464 --> 1:19:36.815
He had no friends or family,
just us.

1:19:36.859 --> 1:19:38.817
I think we can skip that part.

1:19:38.861 --> 1:19:40.993
How much do we save?

1:19:41.037 --> 1:19:43.300
Oh, there will be savings.

1:19:43.343 --> 1:19:45.302
Let's go back to the office.

1:19:45.737 --> 1:19:47.043
Please.

1:19:56.966 --> 1:19:57.923
[beeps]

1:19:57.967 --> 1:20:01.318
Randolph, 4-2-2-9-8, please.

1:20:07.411 --> 1:20:09.543
Christina, please.
[crying]

1:20:15.332 --> 1:20:16.855
Nancy.

1:20:16.899 --> 1:20:19.031
Nancy.

1:20:19.075 --> 1:20:20.685
[whimpering]

1:20:29.607 --> 1:20:31.348
[whimpering]

1:20:36.744 --> 1:20:38.398
[whimpering]

1:20:57.026 --> 1:20:58.984
[panting]

1:21:12.345 --> 1:21:14.260
[Carol] What do you wanna do?
We have, like, five minutes.

1:21:14.304 --> 1:21:16.872
- We gotta check these rooms.
- Fuck.

1:21:30.494 --> 1:21:32.191
It's locked.

1:21:37.762 --> 1:21:39.982
[lock rattling]

1:21:45.639 --> 1:21:46.727
Hey!

1:21:49.643 --> 1:21:52.037
[screaming]

1:21:52.081 --> 1:21:53.865

1:22:09.489 --> 1:22:12.057
[Vincent laughing echoes]

1:22:29.814 --> 1:22:33.122
[Vincent VO] I only wanted
to tell my story, Christina.

1:22:34.862 --> 1:22:36.864
[whimpering]

1:22:41.913 --> 1:22:43.828

1:23:28.742 --> 1:23:31.528
[grunting]

1:24:16.573 --> 1:24:21.273
[Vincent VO]
You send investigators
into my house to snoop?

1:24:21.317 --> 1:24:24.711
If they had gotten out,
if they had exploited me,

1:24:24.755 --> 1:24:28.324
I would be the first stop on every future investigation.

1:24:28.367 --> 1:24:30.326
I couldn't take that risk,
Christina.

1:24:30.369 --> 1:24:32.415
- So it ends tonight!
- [screams]

1:24:32.458 --> 1:24:34.504

[Vincent grunts]

1:24:50.259 --> 1:24:52.391
That's right, it does.

1:24:53.088 --> 1:24:55.090
[screams]

1:24:57.179 --> 1:24:59.920

1:25:36.783 --> 1:25:38.350
Oh, come on.

1:25:39.177 --> 1:25:41.223
No, no, no.

1:25:44.008 --> 1:25:45.401
[grunts]

1:25:48.926 --> 1:25:50.449

Hey, hey, hey, hey.Are you crazy or something?

I coulda killed you.

1:28:52.501 --> 1:28:54.154
- Thank you.
- What the hell are you doing

1:28:54.198 --> 1:28:55.808
jumping in the middleof the damn street anyway?

1:28:55.852 --> 1:28:58.115
- They killed my sister.
- Is someone chasing you?

1:28:58.158 --> 1:29:00.378
He killed my sister.
[whimpers]

1:29:00.422 --> 1:29:03.599
Let me take you to the doctor

1:29:03.642 --> 1:29:05.688
Everybody's-everybody's dead.

Oh, don't you worry,
little girl.

1:29:11.650 --> 1:29:15.393
I'll figure it out, all right?

1:29:15.437 --> 1:29:16.655
He's one of the best doctors.

1:29:16.699 --> 1:29:18.744
