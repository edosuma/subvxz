03:07.083 --> 03:10.915
Petter? Are you okay?
Shall we utop?

03:13.625 --> 03:16.082
Hey...

03:16.208 --> 03:20.207
Bro? Stay awake.

03:41.416 --> 03:45.249
You fall out, you're out of here.

03:47.041 --> 03:50.290
Anuwer me, Petter,
or I'll take you out.

03:54.291 --> 03:57.040
Okay.

04:01.708 --> 04:05.290
Just take him out
if that's what you want.

04:06.625 --> 04:10.915
What's going on out there?
What's up with Leif?

04:11.541 --> 04:14.207
They won't take you out.

04:32.291 --> 04:35.374
They're yelling at each other.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.540
Bro? Pia wants a word with you.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.540
- Huh?
- Petter?

04:41.833 --> 04:43.624
Hi.

04:43.791 --> 04:47.374
Put the cap back on.
You're not registering on the EEG.

04:47.458 --> 04:51.207
- Why don't you come in and put it on?
- Very nice.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.749
Slight change of plans.
Step into the other chamber.

04:55.833 --> 05:00.749
- Now don't break his heart, sir.
- No, not Pete. You.

05:00.875 --> 05:06.249
- I'm sorry, Mike. I have to take you out.
- What are you talking about?

05:06.375 --> 05:09.832
- What did I do?
- Just do as you're told.

05:14.291 --> 05:18.707
Get into the other chamber,
or you're off the program.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.624
Leif?

05:22.750 --> 05:27.124
Leif? Why was he taken out?

05:27.250 --> 05:32.290
Close the hatch. We're cleaning out
the American gas mix.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.790
I feel like shit.

06:47.916 --> 06:50.332
Continue pressurisation.

06:51.250 --> 06:53.415
We're almost there.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.832
495...

06:56.416 --> 06:58.624
Is this normal?

06:58.708 --> 07:04.165
- There's nothing normal about this.
- 496...

07:04.291 --> 07:07.374
That politician's here with a cake.

07:28.125 --> 07:31.457
Who let that bird in here?

07:44.166 --> 07:48.457
- There's an albatross in here.
- No, it's a seagull.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.749
It's an albatross.

07:52.833 --> 07:58.249
- I've seen them in the Gulf of Mexico.
- The wings are different.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.749
Leif?
What are they talking about?

08:17.958 --> 08:21.249
- Goddammit, they're hallucinating.
- Jørgen?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.332
- Can you see the bird?
- What bird?

08:24.458 --> 08:26.790
Five hundred!

08:35.541 --> 08:38.124
My lungs are on fire.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.664
Let us handle the gas next time, okay?

08:45.708 --> 08:48.374
Congratulations from the directorate.

08:48.500 --> 08:53.290
You're the first Norwegians
to be pressurised to 500 metres.

09:00.458 --> 09:05.207
Recently, a world record for simulated
deep diving was set here.

09:05.375 --> 09:08.457
- Does it feel good?
- Yeah, it does.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.332
Look at him!

09:11.458 --> 09:14.124
What are the biggest challenges
when diving this deep?

09:14.250 --> 09:16.207
I'm on TV.

09:16.291 --> 09:21.582
In very deep water, the air basically
turns to poison inside the body.

09:21.708 --> 09:26.749
A gas needed to be developed to help
the divers breathe at such depths.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.790
What's working with the Americans like?

09:29.916 --> 09:31.332
It's uncle!

09:31.458 --> 09:35.749
Exciting. They've got
a lot of experience in this.

09:36.541 --> 09:39.540
One of the diving teams is Norwegian.

09:39.708 --> 09:43.624
I think we're in control of the process.

09:44.041 --> 09:48.249
Norwegian authorities wish to
pipe the petroleum ashore.

09:48.375 --> 09:53.332
But first the divers must prove
they can work at such depths.

09:53.458 --> 09:59.499
Petter will go on a new test dive led by
the USS company Deep Sea Diving tomorrow.

09:59.583 --> 10:06.165
320 metres below the surface, they'll
join two pipe sections in a habitat.

10:06.250 --> 10:09.915
What will it be like to reach
the ocean floor?

10:10.083 --> 10:13.290
It's what we've been training for.

10:13.416 --> 10:18.415
Why we've done this experiment.
So we're looking forward to it.

10:18.541 --> 10:21.374
In the USS, Ronald Reagan has...

10:21.500 --> 10:25.290
- Did you see dad on TV?
- No, just uncle.

10:25.416 --> 10:29.082
- It wasn't exactly about you.
- Sure it was!

10:29.166 --> 10:31.832
He's the one they interviewed.

10:32.916 --> 10:37.332
- Yeah, but it wasn't about you.
- You're not mad at me?

10:47.500 --> 10:50.540
This next dive will be my last.

10:53.791 --> 10:57.582
- Because?
- I'm gonna become a diving supervisor.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.874
- I'll make loads of money.
- Been drinking paint?

11:05.083 --> 11:08.249
We make ten times what they do.

11:08.375 --> 11:14.124
We don't. They get to see their family
twenty times as much as we do.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.582
Is this Maria's idea?

11:17.791 --> 11:20.207
Nope.

11:22.416 --> 11:27.082
- You're gonna dive until you're sixty?
- Sure I will.

11:27.208 --> 11:31.707
- You live on a boat. Got no family.
- I've got you.

11:31.833 --> 11:35.749
But no kids.
All that will change.

11:35.875 --> 11:39.665
Then you'll see what I mean.

11:39.791 --> 11:42.165
Look ahead, Petter.

12:26.083 --> 12:30.207
- Get everybody below, alright?
- Okay.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.624
Welcome aboard!
Let's get below.

12:35.083 --> 12:38.499
Give me a minute.
Fellows, straight on.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.165
Boss? From your wife.

12:41.291 --> 12:45.624
- And from Marianne.
- What about me?

12:45.750 --> 12:49.665
There's no doubt this is
the right group of men.

12:49.750 --> 12:53.540
But we still have to prove it
to the ministry.

12:53.666 --> 12:57.415
That's the point
of this verification dive.

12:57.541 --> 13:02.665
So you'll be at 320 metres.
Three-man teams, twelve-hour shifts.

13:02.833 --> 13:08.374
Focus on the job in front of you, and
we'll all end up making a lot of money.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.499
Who goes out first?

13:12.541 --> 13:15.332
- The Norwegians.
- Why?

13:15.458 --> 13:18.790
Cause I'm saving you for cleanup, ace.

13:20.583 --> 13:24.207
- First in the Norway Trench.
- English, motherfucker.

13:24.333 --> 13:27.207
He said you're an idiot.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.707
Team one, enter the bell.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.040
Going for a seal.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.082
How are you feeling, boys?

13:56.208 --> 13:59.124
- Feeling good.
- Never felt better.

13:59.250 --> 14:03.874
Pete? You're first.
Jørgen will stay in the bell. Good luck!

14:04.041 --> 14:07.415
You're the big TV star, you know.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.540
Open gas supply divers.

15:00.625 --> 15:04.374
- Gas open.
- You got the balls for this?

15:36.291 --> 15:38.874
Diver one out of the bell.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.749
Diver one leaving the basket.

16:17.458 --> 16:38.332
Petter?

16:38.625 --> 16:40.707
Have you landed?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.165
That's one small step for man,

16:43.291 --> 16:47.540
but a huge leap for an ordinary guy
from the projects.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.249
Diver two leaving the basket.

17:32.666 --> 17:34.624
Do you have a visual?

17:38.666 --> 17:41.249
I've got visual.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.749
Okay. You can enter the habitat.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.415
Diver one inside the habitat.

18:28.416 --> 18:31.374
Diver two inside the habitat.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.957
Start pressurisation.

18:45.833 --> 18:50.749
Thirty, forty, forty-two, forty-six...

18:51.750 --> 18:55.707
- Closing the valve.
- Now the other side.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.540
Forward pipe.

19:16.875 --> 19:20.499
We're blowing out the water.

19:48.708 --> 19:51.457
- There's water seeping in.
- Okay.

19:51.541 --> 19:54.707
- Is it a lot?
- No, it's not much.

19:54.833 --> 19:59.332
We just need more pressure.
We'll fix it. Ready?

19:59.500 --> 20:03.874
- Increase pressure by five bars.
- Increasing pressure.

20:22.166 --> 20:25.582
- Shut the valve, Petter!
- Turn it off!

20:28.500 --> 20:31.374
Knut? Petter?

20:32.375 --> 20:35.040
Report, dammit!

20:35.625 --> 20:38.749
Petter? We've lost contact!

20:40.875 --> 20:43.915
- I'm here.
- Focus on finding Knut!

20:45.208 --> 20:47.415
Can you see him?

20:48.916 --> 20:50.749
Knut! Knut!

20:50.875 --> 20:54.540
- He's here!
- Is he conscious?

20:54.708 --> 20:57.665
Bro! Bro!

20:57.833 --> 21:00.665
Can you get him to the surface?

21:02.208 --> 21:06.332
- His mask is smashed! It's smashed!
- Just take it off.

21:07.625 --> 21:11.790
- I'm removing his mask.
- Check his pulse.

21:11.916 --> 21:15.665
Bro! Knut!

21:15.791 --> 21:18.915
Petter? Is he breathing?

21:19.541 --> 21:21.749
He's breathing!

21:27.791 --> 21:30.582
Tell us what's going on!

21:31.750 --> 21:35.790
Don't move!
We'll send Jørgen down to help you.

21:35.916 --> 21:37.874
He won't make it!

21:38.041 --> 21:40.874
I'm giving him my mask.

21:42.208 --> 21:46.040
I'm giving him my mask. Bro. Bro!

21:46.166 --> 21:48.832
I'm coming out now.

21:48.958 --> 21:53.749
- You won't make it back to the bell!
- Draw in the umbilical.

21:53.875 --> 21:57.582
No! You'll never make it
without a mask!

21:58.583 --> 22:01.832
You hear what I'm saying, Petter? No!

22:12.625 --> 22:15.124
Petter?

22:16.541 --> 22:22.832
- Jørgen? Pull in Petter's umbilical.
- Copy that. Pulling them in now.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.582
Where's Knut?!

23:23.791 --> 23:26.290
Flood the bell, dammit!

23:26.833 --> 23:29.040
Flooding the bell.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.374
I've got him!

23:36.500 --> 23:38.707
I've got him.

23:39.666 --> 23:42.249
- You've got him?
- Got him!

23:42.416 --> 23:45.540
- Is he breathing?
- Bro?

23:45.625 --> 23:48.165
He's not breathing!

23:48.375 --> 23:50.665
Petter! Give him CPR.

23:55.208 --> 23:58.249
Come on, bro!
Hurry! Get us up!

23:58.375 --> 24:00.124
Close the hatch.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.540
- I've got a seal.
- Get us up!

24:10.625 --> 24:14.165
You're not going anywhere!

24:16.041 --> 24:18.290
Not anywhere, bro!

24:30.166 --> 24:33.207
Bell on surface!

24:33.333 --> 24:38.582
- I blacked out. What the hell happened?
- I don't know. I don't know!

24:44.083 --> 24:46.374
Trunk is equalised.

25:08.416 --> 25:12.082
Get the hypo from
the equipment lock, Jørgen.

25:18.666 --> 25:23.082
Push it hard and deep.
As deep as it goes. Now, Petter!

25:31.166 --> 25:33.832
Nothing's happening.

25:50.375 --> 25:53.790
Come on, bro. Come on...

25:57.500 --> 26:00.374
That's enough.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.540
Petter...

26:09.333 --> 26:11.499
It's too late.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.624
What happened?

27:01.791 --> 27:04.374
I don't know.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.957
Maria? We're ready to go.

27:18.125 --> 27:21.915
Ferris?
Get me out of here, man.

27:22.083 --> 27:26.249
As quick as you can.
Put me on the emergency table.

27:26.416 --> 27:32.332
Pete, I can't take that chance. I'm afraid
you'll get decompression sickness.

27:32.458 --> 27:36.915
Sorry, you gotta stay in there
two more weeks.

28:10.625 --> 28:15.332
Did you notice anything weird
about the breathing gas?

28:15.458 --> 28:18.040
Or hear anything?

28:18.166 --> 28:22.082
I blacked out.
There must have been a gas cut.

28:22.208 --> 28:24.540
I know.

28:48.291 --> 28:51.249
Petter? How are you feeling?

28:54.625 --> 29:00.665
Jørgen says there was a cut.
This is your responsibility, Trond.

29:00.791 --> 29:04.290
- Careful now, Petter.
- Petter...

29:04.416 --> 29:06.624
I never said that.

29:07.916 --> 29:12.040
You said you heard how
I stopped breathing.

29:29.666 --> 29:34.499
Listen, you need some sleep.
Do yourself a favour. Take those pills.

29:47.875 --> 29:50.540
I wanna speak to Ferris.

29:50.666 --> 29:54.624
- Ferris isn't here.
- Where is he?

29:57.958 --> 30:03.040
We had a cut. I had no gas.
I was out of it before the explosion.

30:03.125 --> 30:08.165
- Relax. We'll figure it out.
- We both know who controlled the gas!

30:09.541 --> 30:15.082
- That's not true. I kept an eye on it.
- Then what do you think happened?

30:20.458 --> 30:23.957
You inflated the plug until it blew up.

30:28.916 --> 30:32.124
Because I passed out! Explain that!

30:32.250 --> 30:36.582
- Okay, this conversation is over.
- Explain it!

31:05.541 --> 31:09.540
Petter? My condolences.
You want Knut's briefcase?

31:11.416 --> 31:24.540
Trond?

31:32.666 --> 31:34.832
Ferris?

31:36.958 --> 31:39.540
I'll talk to you later.

31:44.041 --> 31:47.290
- Where's Trond?
- He's not on board.

31:47.416 --> 31:50.374
- I sent him home.
- Why?

31:50.458 --> 31:53.582
This touches everybody.
Trond as well.

31:55.333 --> 32:00.832
Look, Pete. We can have the best
technology, take every precaution.

32:00.958 --> 32:03.749
But still...

32:05.041 --> 32:08.207
Mistakes get made, don't they?

32:36.583 --> 32:41.540
Listen to me. Nothing will bring
your brother back. Speculating,

32:41.666 --> 32:47.165
pointing fingers, won't do anybody
any good. Not Maria, not Mark,

32:47.291 --> 32:52.957
and certainly not the project.
There's a hell of a lot at stake here.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.790
I'll take care of the press.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.457
Jeger!

33:08.333 --> 33:10.540
Jeger! Hi.

33:13.458 --> 33:18.165
- My condolences.
- What's the directorate gonna do?

33:18.625 --> 33:22.540
About Trond Edvardsen.
He screwed up the breathing gas.

33:22.666 --> 33:28.082
- If there's any ambiguity...
- That cut should never have happened.

33:28.333 --> 33:33.374
We're going to investigate it thoroughly.
I promise. Look here.

33:34.666 --> 33:36.957
Call me anytime.

33:40.208 --> 33:44.707
This isn't what I ask for.
It's not what I want.

33:44.833 --> 33:49.332
- No, I understand.
- So what are you gonna do about it?

33:50.500 --> 33:55.332
Mortal accidents are complex events.
The supervisor disagrees.

33:55.416 --> 33:59.165
I know what he thinks.
I made no mistakes.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.915
Well, let's see what
the police have to say.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.832
Maria!

35:42.750 --> 35:44.915
Here.

35:46.625 --> 35:50.415
It needs new batteries.
Unscrew the bottom.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.957
- I'll get by.
- It wasn't my fault.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.540
It was an accident, okay?

36:40.375 --> 36:46.415
Hey! I wanna see the recording from
the accident. The video tape.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.249
I'd love to show it to you.

36:56.625 --> 37:00.582
- But there isn't any.
- "There isn't any"?

37:00.708 --> 37:02.915
Have you erased it?

37:03.083 --> 37:06.374
There wasn't any tape
in the recorder.

37:08.083 --> 37:12.415
- You expect me to believe that?
- Ask Leif, Ronald, Ferris.

37:12.541 --> 37:16.832
- I'll ask Jørgen. Where is he?
- On sick leave.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.957
Sick leave? Why?

37:20.166 --> 37:23.832
- I guess he's ill.
- Just let me see the tape.

37:23.958 --> 37:27.540
- He said there's no tape.
- Shut the fuck up!

37:27.625 --> 37:31.749
Petter.
You over inflated the plug.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.707
You can't change that.

37:49.375 --> 37:52.207
Hey! Jørgen!

37:54.875 --> 37:56.957
Hi.

37:58.166 --> 38:01.957
- Trond says you're sick.
- I've been a bit off.

38:02.125 --> 38:07.540
- You're not sick. You're working.
- I'm feeling better now.

38:09.916 --> 38:13.665
Has someone told you to
keep your mouth shut?

38:13.791 --> 38:18.499
Jørgen! Answer me.
Why won't Trond show me the tape?

38:18.583 --> 38:21.915
- What are you talking about?
- What happened?

38:22.041 --> 38:24.665
I had a cut! You heard it!

38:35.416 --> 38:38.332
Jørgen!

38:38.458 --> 38:41.040
Jørgen?

38:41.750 --> 38:44.249
Jørgen! Hey!

38:45.041 --> 38:47.207
Jørgen!

38:56.375 --> 39:00.915
- Something's wrong with Jørgen!
- Another seizure?

39:09.791 --> 39:13.707
Hi. I need a word with Leif
about Jørgen.

39:13.833 --> 39:17.165
- He gets seizures.
- I know he's on...

39:17.250 --> 39:21.915
Did he get one in the bell
while monitoring the gas?

39:22.083 --> 39:25.082
I don't know anything about that.

39:26.666 --> 39:29.124
- Are you back?
- No.

39:36.208 --> 39:40.332
Dimwit. Put it out!
We have hydrogen right behind you.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.540
Leif? Hi.

39:43.583 --> 39:46.540
How long have you
known Jørgen's sick?

39:46.666 --> 39:49.290
What's wrong with him?

39:49.416 --> 39:54.540
- Health is a private matter.
- His dad says he's had several seizures.

39:55.625 --> 40:00.249
- I need to do another EEG test on you.
- Because?

40:00.375 --> 40:02.874
Because it's myjob.

40:06.041 --> 40:08.957
Has Jørgen taken another test?

40:09.125 --> 40:11.249
- Leif?
- Yeah.

40:11.375 --> 40:16.499
Did you know Jørgen was sick when
you sent him down on that dive?

40:16.583 --> 40:19.957
- It wasn't my call.
- What do you mean?

40:20.125 --> 40:24.707
- Ferris would like to talk to you.
- Leif?

40:25.291 --> 40:27.374
Now.

40:40.791 --> 40:45.374
Ronald!
I'd like to see Jørgen's EEG test.

40:47.708 --> 40:49.874
We'll discuss this in my office.

41:10.750 --> 41:14.374
Rats seem to stand pressure
better than us.

41:15.625 --> 41:19.457
Okay. Jørgen's EEG test.

41:21.208 --> 41:24.332
See? Normal.

41:27.708 --> 41:29.957
I need a copy.

41:30.166 --> 41:35.457
Staff medical info is confidential.
It belongs to Deep Sea Diving.

41:35.541 --> 41:38.665
They co-funded the project.

41:41.541 --> 41:48.207
Pete, please. If there was something
wrong here, I'd tell you. Honestly.

41:48.291 --> 41:53.457
Tests like these...
They're really open to interpretation.

41:53.541 --> 41:56.832
We also judge divers
on their performance.

41:56.958 --> 42:00.624
It really comes down to how you feel.

42:02.708 --> 42:05.749
So how do you feel?

42:05.875 --> 42:08.540
Fine.

43:43.625 --> 43:45.540
Hey, Ronald?

43:50.041 --> 43:52.207
Ronald?

43:59.833 --> 44:02.040
Are you there?

45:26.041 --> 45:29.915
You can read stuff into the tests,
like Leif did.

45:30.083 --> 45:34.374
- You can find anything.
- It says that Jørgen's ill.

45:34.500 --> 45:38.290
They're normal.
Only Leif sees the connection.

45:38.416 --> 45:42.957
- What connection? Jørgen's sick.
- Yeah.

45:43.125 --> 45:49.540
But medically speaking, these charts
don't say so. It's Leif's interpretation.

45:49.666 --> 45:54.290
You sent a sick diver down there.
Leif obviously knew.

45:54.416 --> 45:58.165
He wrote the conclusion in hindsight.

45:58.291 --> 46:04.665
This is a bad time for you to get fired.
They're preparing a new test dive.

46:04.791 --> 46:07.707
- I won't dive now.
- You have to.

46:07.833 --> 46:14.082
The Petroleum Directorate needs to keep
one Norwegian diver in the program.

46:47.416 --> 46:51.207
- Thank you.
- Thank you for meeting us.

46:56.041 --> 46:59.749
- We need to talk.
- Do you have an appointment?

46:59.875 --> 47:03.832
- Talk to my secretary.
- I've something to show you.

47:03.916 --> 47:07.249
The police are doing
what they can to...

47:10.583 --> 47:15.582
Jørgen manned the bell at the time.
He's sick. It says so here.

47:19.500 --> 47:23.707
- Isn't this confidential?
- Just take a look.

47:23.833 --> 47:27.165
I can't interpret this. Can you?

47:27.291 --> 47:32.332
I think he caused my brother's death.
He gets seizures. I've seen it.

47:36.125 --> 47:39.707
- Have you shown this to anyone?
- No.

47:40.541 --> 47:46.290
I'll follow it up. But we need
to conclude the verification dives.

47:46.416 --> 47:49.332
The mission isn't over yet.

47:49.458 --> 47:53.207
I won't dive until I know what
happened to my brother.

47:53.333 --> 47:56.165
Right. I understand.

49:05.125 --> 49:07.207
- Hi!
- Hi.

49:08.333 --> 49:11.874
- Uncle?
- The police called.

49:15.125 --> 49:17.332
Hi. It's like this:

49:17.458 --> 49:21.874
Jørgen Heimland has taken
responsibility for the accident.

49:22.083 --> 49:27.124
He admits that he shut
the wrong valve in the diving bell.

49:27.291 --> 49:31.957
- He did what? Could you repeat that?
- He cut your breathing gas.

49:33.208 --> 49:36.040
- Okay. How's that?
- Human error.

49:36.166 --> 49:38.332
But was it a seizure?

49:38.458 --> 49:41.540
The report doesn't mention any seizure.

49:41.666 --> 49:45.290
You don't know what happened?

49:45.375 --> 49:48.957
You can file a civil lawsuit
if you want to.

49:49.166 --> 49:52.582
- No.
- Why not?

49:52.666 --> 49:54.832
I couldn't bear it.

49:56.041 --> 50:00.540
- What does the report say?
- It says what I just said.

50:45.208 --> 50:49.165
- Is Jørgen here?
- Jørgen's gone to Spain.

50:51.333 --> 50:54.207
Tell him I wanna talk to him.

52:12.958 --> 52:15.415
Are you alright?

52:21.333 --> 52:23.915
What happened?

52:24.916 --> 52:28.707
You tried to kill me.
That's what happened.

52:28.833 --> 52:33.082
Couldn't avoid you.
You broke into me.

52:33.875 --> 52:36.540
You flipped that car on your own.

52:39.375 --> 52:43.374
Who asked you to steal these EEG tests?
Was it Leif?

52:44.291 --> 52:47.874
Where's mine? I want mine.
Where the fuck is mine?

52:48.041 --> 52:51.290
- Why do you want it?
- It could end my career!

52:51.458 --> 52:55.790
You know your friend, Leif?
He's a fucking hack.

52:55.916 --> 52:58.624
Says I'm neurologically damaged.

54:18.583 --> 54:22.290
Petter? I need to talk to you.

54:26.541 --> 54:29.082
What are you doing here?

54:30.375 --> 54:32.749
Were you here earlier?

54:32.833 --> 54:35.957
What do you mean?
We need to talk.

54:37.250 --> 54:41.915
- What are you doing here?
- I'm gonna find out how Knut died.

54:43.041 --> 54:46.540
Okay.
And you think I've got the answer?

54:48.500 --> 54:52.957
The gas Ronald's given you
contains a secret component.

54:53.125 --> 54:57.707
And the goddamn Americans
won't say what it is.

54:57.833 --> 55:01.874
I made him stop using it
at the research centre.

55:02.041 --> 55:07.249
But they call the shots at sea.
So Knut promised to help us.

55:09.541 --> 55:12.249
With what?

55:12.375 --> 55:16.915
He was gonna take a sample
of the American gas in the bell.

55:17.083 --> 55:20.707
- Didn't he tell you?
- What are you saying?

55:20.791 --> 55:23.707
What sort of bullshit is that?

55:23.833 --> 55:27.499
Did you find a gas sample
in Knut's briefcase?

55:27.625 --> 55:34.165
- I'd know it if he was taking a sample.
- Ronald's drugging you with that gas.

55:34.291 --> 55:39.165
You wobbled around like a drunkard.
That's why you passed out.

55:39.291 --> 55:43.665
- Jørgen's taken the blame.
- He'd never turn off the gas.

55:43.750 --> 55:48.540
Listen to this. Listen to Knut's voice.
He didn't pass out.

55:48.666 --> 55:51.374
What's that?

55:51.500 --> 55:55.165
The tape from the accident.

55:55.291 --> 55:59.707
- Trond said there wasn't any tape.
- Trond?

56:00.708 --> 56:02.874
I took the tape.

56:06.416 --> 56:11.624
- Okay, you can turn it off now.
- It's enough now, Petter.

56:11.750 --> 56:15.790
- Petter, stop it! I'm stuck here!
- Petter?

56:15.916 --> 56:18.832
Knut has no problems with the gas.

56:18.958 --> 56:23.540
- You were on the same feed.
- Shut the valve, Petter!

56:25.583 --> 56:27.790
Knut! Petter!

56:27.916 --> 56:33.165
- Report, goddammit!
- Petter! We've lost contact!

56:45.375 --> 56:50.374
Find the gas sample,
and I'll reveal who did this.

56:52.625 --> 56:57.332
Lift it up and get this part in there.
That's it. Great!

56:58.958 --> 57:03.499
Martin? Remember
the flashlight I gave you?

57:04.041 --> 57:08.207
- You know where it is?
- In a suitcase.

57:08.333 --> 57:10.624
- Your suitcase?
- I think so.

57:10.791 --> 57:14.540
- Where is it?
- In my room.

57:25.250 --> 57:27.749
What's that?

57:31.166 --> 57:34.374
It's a gas sample.

57:53.916 --> 57:56.374
Leif?

57:56.500 --> 58:07.582
Hello?

58:12.625 --> 58:54.457
Leif?

58:57.583 --> 59:00.457
Leif...

59:01.833 --> 59:05.165
Leif?

59:05.375 --> 59:07.457
Hey!

01:00:06.916 --> 01:00:09.290
Hey! Hey!

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:24.374
Hey!

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.707
Leif died as a result of
a morphine overdose,

01:02:37.875 --> 01:02:44.165
according to the police. The medical
examiner has yet to verify that, but...

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:48.415
I know some of you were aware
of the courageous efforts

01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:51.957
that Leif made to battle his addiction.

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:57.957
He was supposed to be in rehab this
week. Unfortunately he never checked in.

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:04.332
The family would obviously prefer
that the manner of his death

01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:06.707
not become public knowledge.

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:09.540
I found Knut's gas cylinder.

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:15.249
It's up to each one of us to help
protect a colleague's reputation.

01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:20.957
Let's observe a moment of silence
in memory of our friend, Leif Lindberg.

01:03:21.125 --> 01:03:23.207
I hope he's found some peace.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.957
You want me to test it?

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:37.624
It's empty.

01:03:46.833 --> 01:03:50.707
I have to know what's in
that goddamn gas.

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:56.082
If I go on the next dive,
bring back a gas sample,

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:59.332
will you test it when I get back?

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:06.040
Not after what you've been through.
You need a break.

01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:11.457
And you're physically not prepared.
They've been training for weeks.

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:15.040
Pete, that's my final decision.

01:04:41.541 --> 01:04:43.957
To the right.

01:05:01.833 --> 01:05:07.040
- There are no Norwegian divers left.
- That's why you have to go.

01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:12.290
- The Americans refuse to let me dive.
- Who's stopping you?

01:05:12.416 --> 01:05:15.040
The diving physician. Ronald.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:20.040
- What's he saying?
- That I'm not prepared.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:23.749
That I'm not fit. I don't know.

01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:33.457
The pipeline will come ashore there.

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:37.040
The Americans think
they've won the contract.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:42.290
That they can just open the tap
and help themselves.

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:47.874
- You'll make a good supervisor.
- That's not what I want. I wanna dive.

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:52.665
I'm talking about
your future opportunities.

01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:55.499
When we start pumping the oil.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:06:00.374
Of course you'll dive.
It's not up to the physician to decide.

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:09.957
Are you ready?

01:06:38.791 --> 01:06:41.790
I'm going back to work.

01:06:58.875 --> 01:07:02.499
I'll be back in three weeks.

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:05.332
That's exactly what Knut said.

01:07:15.416 --> 01:07:17.915
Let me show you something.

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:25.374
You can turn it off.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.165
Petter! Turn it off!

01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:30.540
You hear me?! Shut...

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.624
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:48.290
I have to find out what happened.

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:51.124
I have to understand, get it?

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:55.540
- I don't need to know.
- But I do!

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:58.832
That's why I have to go down there.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:05.082
I'm sorry about your friend. Leif.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.165
We all get what's coming to us.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:25.332
- Petter? For you.
- Hey, missy! You're a scientist.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:28.374
Inspect this!

01:09:34.957 --> 01:09:38.874
You recently lost your brother
on a similar dive.

01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:41.874
How does that affect your work?

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:45.540
I think he'd have wanted me
to go on diving.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:49.874
I don't really think
it's affected my work.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:57.957
- Excuse me? Dr. Lindberg called me.
- Leif?

01:09:58.125 --> 01:10:02.499
The day before he died.
Wanted to talk about the accident.

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:05.415
Anything else we should know?

01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:10.040
Do me a favour and call me
if you remember anything.

01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:20.624
Be careful about what
you say to the press.

01:10:21.583 --> 01:10:24.332
You heard me.

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.332
The gas sample
you're taking in the bell.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:33.290
Give it to Pia as soon as you're back.
Don't try to get smart.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:52.540
- Pete? Think you're ready for this?
- What?

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.249
You ready for this?

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:59.415
Yeah, you don't think so?

01:11:33.041 --> 01:11:36.832
- Petter's going first.
- Fuck you he's going first.

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:42.249
- It's my fucking record, sir.
- This is not about your record, Mike.

01:11:43.041 --> 01:11:46.249
We're here to prove
we can build the pipeline.

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:50.790
It's all right, Trond.
Take Phil. I'll tend the bell.

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:55.790
- Just do as you're told, guys.
- This is bullshit.

01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:07.457
Open gas supply divers.

01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:10.874
Gas open.

01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:16.540
Come on, Pete.
Pull yourself together.

01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:30.874
Begin to pressurise.

01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:43.749
Trond?

01:14:43.916 --> 01:14:49.540
I don't feel too good. I'll switch places
with Phillip, and man the bell.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:53.082
Phillip?
You'll have to do the welding.

01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:56.915
I knew you weren't ready.

01:15:10.041 --> 01:15:12.207
Okay, guys.

01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:16.915
Give me an update on the welding.

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:23.124
Guys?

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:26.665
Phillip?

01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:30.582
Mike?

01:15:32.916 --> 01:15:35.790
Okay.

01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:39.165
How long do you have left?

01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:42.832
Should be done in an hour.

01:15:42.958 --> 01:15:45.165
Okay.

01:16:34.708 --> 01:16:41.082
Ready for your photo, pinup girl?
That's why you're here, right?

01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:44.874
To celebrate all the work
we've done for you.

01:18:15.708 --> 01:18:18.165
Bet you just had to see me.

01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:21.582
- Hi.
- Hi. I couldn't get the sample.

01:18:21.708 --> 01:18:26.124
- Why not?
- I didn't have time. No room for it.

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:29.874
- Welcome back. How've you been?
- Alright.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.124
How did Jeger know
about the sample?

01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:37.457
Who do you think I work for?

01:18:39.208 --> 01:18:43.374
To build the pipeline ourselves,
we need the American gas recipe.

01:18:45.583 --> 01:18:50.165
- Were you going to give me the results?
- Yes, of course.

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:39.499
Mike! You know where Ronald is?

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:43.415
I don't know.
Maybe he's still downstairs.

01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:49.374
Petter... Petter!

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.832
If you have the sample,
give it to me now.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:59.415
- You risk your life if you keep it.
- I don't have it.

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.915
You leaving?

01:20:16.541 --> 01:20:19.582
I've proved what they hired me to do.

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:22.957
I've got a sample of your breathing mix.

01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:27.499
- Where?
- You tell me what's in it first.

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:32.290
I can get someone to test it.
And I will go public.

01:20:34.541 --> 01:20:39.457
- It's a secret. It's how I make my living.
- By drugging us?

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.749
Let me show you something, Pete.

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:51.665
At the depths you boys need to work,

01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:54.540
the nervous system is affected
by the pressure.

01:20:54.666 --> 01:20:59.165
You need an anaesthetic
to work down there.

01:20:59.916 --> 01:21:04.624
- Anaesthetic?
- Drug. Call it whatever you like.

01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:11.207
You need something to overcome
the effects of that pressure sickness.

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:24.207
I wanna explain why you need
an anaesthetic. Without it, you'd collapse.

01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:34.207
We've just passed 500 metres.

01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:40.040
The big glass has no anaesthetics.
Which would you rather be?

01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:46.790
I collapsed on your drugs.
My brother died.

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:53.374
- You didn't black out because of my gas.
- I know what happened. I saw the tape.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.999
Think about it.
No one else fainted, only you.

01:21:57.125 --> 01:22:01.582
Jørgen and your brother were fine
until you caused the explosion.

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.124
Jørgen's a mess!

01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:06.665
You and Jørgen are affected,
but not Mike.

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:10.624
And Mike's been on my gas
more than anyone.

01:22:10.791 --> 01:22:13.249
What does that tell you?

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:19.707
- Why did you take him out?
- To save him from Leif's

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:25.457
misguided experiments. It turned out
to be the right goddamn decision.

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:29.207
Your blackouts were caused here,
by Leif.

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:35.290
He took away my gas, the one thing
that could sustain you.

01:22:35.416 --> 01:22:40.082
No one can handle a gas change
like that at 500 metres.

01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:44.832
You began hallucinating, remember?
The albatross?

01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:49.040
Then you and Jørgen
began having blackouts.

01:22:49.166 --> 01:22:51.665
So you're saying what?

01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:59.290
That my brain is damaged?

01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:01.749
Because of Leif?

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:05.540
Why didn't you tell me?

01:23:07.375 --> 01:23:10.665
You sent me down there. You knew.

01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:16.499
- You knew!
- I tried to stop you from going down.

01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:21.124
I tried to stop you, Pete.
You wouldn't listen to me.

01:24:15.166 --> 01:24:17.540
Hey, Pete.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:20.249
Can you hear me?

01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.290
What?

01:24:23.416 --> 01:24:27.415
You've got something of mine,
and I want it back.

01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:30.040
What do you mean?

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:33.790
You know what I mean.

01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:39.165
The gas sample will be given to Jeger
if something happens to me.

01:24:39.291 --> 01:24:43.707
Hey, son?
This is not a negotiation.

01:24:55.541 --> 01:25:00.165
Pete, you're gonna sit there
until you tell me where it is.

01:25:05.041 --> 01:25:07.207
Where is it?

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:12.874
Take him down again.

01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:32.540
Stop!

01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:38.207
Talk to me, son.

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:45.249
- I'll show it to you.
- No. You won't show me.

01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:51.790
You're gonna tell me. We're gonna get it.
Then I'm gonna let you out of here.

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:54.957
Where is it, son?

01:25:59.666 --> 01:26:02.915
Dammit! Down!

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:24.290
- It really doesn't have to be this hard.
- Move.

01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:32.832
- What do you think you're doing?
- You wanna kill him? Do it yourself.

01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:43.832
You need him alive, don't you?

01:26:45.291 --> 01:26:48.249
He's a stubborn son of a bitch.

01:26:50.416 --> 01:26:53.624
- Come and get me when he's out.
- Pete?

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.332
Pete, can you hear me?

01:26:57.416 --> 01:27:02.415
- I'm bringing you back up.
- What about the decompression?

01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:07.082
If you bounce him back this fast,
he might not be around later.

01:27:28.833 --> 01:27:34.040
Does he have a pulse? Check
his breathing, I'm gonna go get Ronald.

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:22.207
We had to bounce him right up?

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:27.457
He's got ten minutes before
he gets decompression sickness.

01:28:38.458 --> 01:28:40.915
Hey!

01:29:56.708 --> 01:30:00.457
Hey! Don't move. Don't move!

01:30:00.583 --> 01:30:04.082
It's me, Petter. It's me.

01:30:06.916 --> 01:30:09.332
Petter, give me five minutes.

01:30:13.416 --> 01:30:17.499
- You can't trust anyone. Leif...
- What did you get to lie?

01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:22.249
I didn't do it for the money,
but to help you.

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:28.082
How does it help me if you lie and take
the blame for something you didn't do?

01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:30.915
We thought it was your fault.

01:30:31.083 --> 01:30:35.332
- I'm not gonna listen to this crap.
- Just hear me out.

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:37.624
They're all in on it.

01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:41.707
Does it look like I've
got time to listen to you?

01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:47.165
I just came from 100 metres in
the chamber. I'm going into the water

01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:51.540
to treat myself for
decompression sickness.

01:30:56.583 --> 01:31:02.665
That guy from the Petroleum Directorate,
Jeger, told me exactly what to say.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:08.832
He got me a plane ticket to Spain,
just to get rid of me. Don't trust him.

01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:09.832
Petter?

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:16.874
Ferris tried to kill me.

01:34:18.541 --> 01:34:22.624
They tried to kill me.

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:24.874
Hey, hey.

01:34:27.833 --> 01:34:31.082
Hush. Hush.

01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:14.915
Hi.

01:35:17.625 --> 01:35:20.374
Coffee?

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.624
No thanks.

01:35:27.875 --> 01:35:30.124
Ferris gave me this.

01:35:33.625 --> 01:35:37.707
He wanted to avoid
a police investigation.

01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:46.624
Why did you accept it?
You wouldn't take my money.

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:51.165
- It's not your responsibility.
- Of course it is.

01:35:51.458 --> 01:35:57.499
Would you rather take money from a guy
who's willing to kill me? Is that better?

01:35:58.541 --> 01:36:04.124
- How was I supposed to know?
- You must have realised something?

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.582
I've realised it's time to look ahead.

01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:28.082
Can I take it?

01:36:30.708 --> 01:36:32.249
Why?

01:36:54.541 --> 01:36:56.874
Hi.

01:36:58.208 --> 01:37:01.499
- They found a dead body.
- Yeah.

01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:04.832
It was Jørgen.

01:37:09.958 --> 01:37:14.124
I've got the gas sample.
I'll give it to you.

01:37:14.250 --> 01:37:17.082
- That's the deal, right?
- Yeah.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:25.249
- As soon as Ferris leaves the country.
- How am I gonna make that happen?

01:37:29.666 --> 01:37:32.707
I'm sure you and Jeger can sort it out.

01:37:48.291 --> 01:37:50.499
Petter?

01:37:50.583 --> 01:37:54.624
The allegations are laughable
but for the damage

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:59.165
they do to my company's reputation.
They're not true.

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:03.082
However, Deep Sea Diving
felt an obligation

01:38:03.208 --> 01:38:06.332
to offer compensation
to his widow.

01:38:06.416 --> 01:38:12.582
There were no preconditions
to this offer of imbursement.

01:38:12.666 --> 01:38:17.624
This is not a business practice
we want in this country.

01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:23.249
Trying to bribe relatives like that
is completely unacceptable.

01:38:23.375 --> 01:38:27.499
Can you lay the pipeline
without the Americans?

01:38:27.583 --> 01:38:33.124
I'm confident we have the necessary
know-how to do the job ourselves.

01:38:50.541 --> 01:38:54.790
- What are you looking for?
- I just don't trust you.

01:38:56.541 --> 01:38:59.332
Relax. We need you.

01:39:00.583 --> 01:39:04.957
I've been named CEO of a new,
state-owned company.

01:39:05.125 --> 01:39:09.540
We have to build the pipeline ourselves.

01:39:09.666 --> 01:39:14.707
- I need someone who's been down there.
- You need the sample.

01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:18.165
The "necessary know-how",
as you call it.

01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:21.499
Yeah.

01:39:21.666 --> 01:39:23.874
We need you as well.

01:39:29.416 --> 01:39:32.915
I want a job as diving supervisor.

01:39:33.875 --> 01:39:36.665
- Okay.
- And I want the money.

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:59.915
The cylinder's in the locker room.

01:40:02.458 --> 01:40:04.499
My brother's locker.

01:40:18.458 --> 01:40:23.540
- Tell Maria we're grateful.
- She expects more than gratitude.

01:40:23.666 --> 01:40:26.290
"More than gratitude"?

01:40:29.333 --> 01:40:35.207
Her husband, your brother, dived down
to 320 metres. He died there.

01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:39.665
He knew it was dangerous,
but he did it - voluntarily.

01:40:39.791 --> 01:40:41.790
It was his job.

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:47.165
The locker room.
Knut Jensen's locker.

01:41:00.333 --> 01:41:04.249
In twenty years,
when his son grows up...

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:09.749
...he'll grow up in one of
the world's richest countries.
