00:05.640 --> 00:08.600
They've found your girl Grace.
She was murdered, Bill.

00:08.680 --> 00:09.880
<i>Her and Adam Elliot.</i>

00:09.960 --> 00:14.120
It's my son. My little boy was murdered.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.960
I need to get to Braeston.
Finish something that I started.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.240
[thunder]

00:18.320 --> 00:20.200
[Bill]<i> One of us did this.</i>

00:20.280 --> 00:22.560
One of us right here.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.200
Our prime subject is Lee Walsh.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.000
-Do any of you know him?
-Sorry.

00:27.080 --> 00:31.040
-[Rob]<i> We have to get rid of the body.</i>
-[Anna]<i> What about the car?</i>

00:33.280 --> 00:34.520
Seventy-five sheets.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.240
[Jay]<i> Those sheets of acid you got me,</i>
<i>the Papa Smurfs?</i>

00:37.320 --> 00:39.320
They're flying off the shelves.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.720
[Craig]<i> Come down, join the fun.</i>
<i>Join the party. Come on.</i>

00:44.520 --> 00:48.280
I found the money, sweetheart,
for the operation.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.600
I knew that you would.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.880
I'm going to tell the police
what happened.

00:52.960 --> 00:58.400
[Louise]<i> I found something</i>
<i>last night in Rob's room.</i>

01:05.760 --> 01:07.400
Robert Elliot?

01:54.880 --> 01:56.800
How can I help you?

01:58.440 --> 02:01.160
This isn't a call we wanted to make,

02:01.240 --> 02:04.240
what with everything you must be
going through right now.

02:06.440 --> 02:10.240
DS told us you're the boy's brother.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.920
Off the news.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.200
So?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.840
Graham Harris.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.480
We received a complaint.
Says you've been following him.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.040
And he's complained? About me?

02:26.680 --> 02:30.520
[officer] He wanted us to come round and
have a word before taking it any further.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.320
What do you mean "take it further"?

02:32.400 --> 02:35.240
If you carry on,
you could be liable to prosecution.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.720
-We understand, officer.
-Are you serious?

02:40.520 --> 02:42.880
Hmm. Hmm.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.040
-Do you know what he did?
-Rob, don't.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.440
[officer] We know about the allegations,
and we know it didn't get to court.

02:50.520 --> 02:54.160
What went on there, that's CID.
It's none of my business.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.920
You want my advice,
try and leave it behind you.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.680
That's your advice?
Leave it behind me?

03:01.760 --> 03:03.840
Calm down, calm down. Calm down.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.760
-After what he did?!
-Rob, stop it!

03:05.840 --> 03:08.520
[officer] Look, you're gonna
have to calm down, OK?

03:21.080 --> 03:22.720
I'll stay away.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.280
I'll stay away.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.920
I'll show you out.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.080
Thank you.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.480
[vehicle passes]

03:59.120 --> 04:00.960
[quiet chatter]

04:03.200 --> 04:06.160
-[man] Take your coat off. Relax.
-I'm fine.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.920
-Come on.
-Really. I'm fine.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.080
Have a drink.

04:13.160 --> 04:17.560
- It's too early for me.
- Suit yourself.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.640
I know better
than to try and make Moira Douglas

04:19.720 --> 04:21.920
do anything she doesn't want to do.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.960
I only came here as a courtesy,
Alastair.

04:26.600 --> 04:32.800
It's like I said on the phone,
I can't do this any more. It's done.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.760
I burned your letters.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.960
Ever since Gracie...

04:43.960 --> 04:45.600
I... [sighs]

04:47.440 --> 04:49.440
It made me think about my family.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.040
If they knew what I was doing...

04:57.720 --> 04:58.920
I'm sorry.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.000
It's torn us all apart, hasn't it?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.400
Ever since Gracie.

05:07.480 --> 05:12.040
It's like that storm
just ripped us all to pieces.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.760
How do you put the pieces
back together?

05:27.880 --> 05:29.840
Maybe I will have that drink.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.120
[moaning and gasping]

05:38.400 --> 05:39.840
[Moira cries out]

05:43.200 --> 05:44.840
[gasping]

05:49.080 --> 05:51.200
[Moira groans and gasps]

05:59.520 --> 06:02.240
[cellphone vibrates]

06:07.280 --> 06:08.440
Hello?

06:10.880 --> 06:12.000
You picked up.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.800
What do you want, Dad?

06:16.680 --> 06:18.520
<i>H-How are you doing? You and Rob?</i>

06:18.600 --> 06:20.160
Don't.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.320
Don't pretend like you suddenly care.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.920
Adam and Grace have been gone
for three days now.

06:27.120 --> 06:31.840
I wanted to call earlier.
I just didn't know how to...

06:33.360 --> 06:34.880
<i>What do you want?</i>

06:37.080 --> 06:38.400
Honestly?

06:39.240 --> 06:42.320
[scoffs] I don't know.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.480
I've been driving all night.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.080
I was coming up to Braeston
to see you all and...

06:49.840 --> 06:52.080
I stopped off here

06:52.160 --> 06:55.880
for a break, keep my eyes open,
and never left, just...

06:55.960 --> 06:57.840
been sitting here.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.960
I never knew the sunrise on the M8
could be so beautiful.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.560
What do you want me to say?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.360
<i>You don't have to say anything.</i>

07:11.360 --> 07:15.160
Look, Dad, turn around. Go home.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.920
We don't need you.
We've managed this long by ourselves.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.480
I miss him, too, Claire.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.560
He was my son.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.600
<i>Was he? What music did he like, then?</i>

07:29.560 --> 07:33.000
<i>What was the last film he saw?</i>
<i>What job did he not get</i>

07:33.080 --> 07:35.680
a few months ago
that he was desperate to get?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.040
It's my fault, Claire.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.720
It's all my fault.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.160
[cellphone rings]

08:04.840 --> 08:06.280
Hi, darling.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.160
-[door closes]
-[footsteps]

08:20.240 --> 08:21.480
[door opens]

08:22.280 --> 08:24.160
Hey, sweetheart.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.640
What is it? What's the matter?

08:27.640 --> 08:28.800
It's nothing.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.960
Really.
You didn't have to come up, I'm fine.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.640
Just tell me.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.559
Um...

08:39.200 --> 08:42.400
Well, a friend of mine from school...

08:44.039 --> 08:45.480
She's dead.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.480
She jumped off her balcony.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.000
Oh, dear. Her poor family.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.760
And she... she took something.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.880
And she sent a picture to her friends
saying that she was going to try it.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.680
They made it look like a Smurf.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.040
It's sick.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.400
I feel like I should send a text
to her brother.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.200
What would you say?

09:17.560 --> 09:20.320
[music plays over dialogue]

09:25.520 --> 09:26.800
Mum?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.520
Mummy? Are you OK?

09:31.600 --> 09:35.000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.880
I'm fine, sweetheart.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.280
[sniffs]

09:41.280 --> 09:43.840
Darling, I'm so sorry.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.040
[cellphone vibrates]

10:30.520 --> 10:32.800
<i>Hi. This is Claire.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

10:32.880 --> 10:34.440
-[beep]
-The Beatles.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.040
He loved the Beatles.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.000
"A Day In The Life."

10:42.080 --> 10:44.360
That was his favorite song.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.000
Well, it was when
he was younger, anyway.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.560
I'm really...

10:52.040 --> 10:53.480
truly sorry, Claire.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.560
You have to believe that.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.400
[horn blasts]

12:06.400 --> 12:10.280
[station PA]<i> Please stand well behind</i>
<i>the yellow line.</i>

12:10.360 --> 12:13.440
-You didn't have to come.
-Yes, I did.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.720
-[Anna] Hey.
-Hey.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.320
Sorry, I know it's freezing,
but do you mind if I finish?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.080
Go ahead.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.640
-Are you alright? You look terrible.
-Thanks.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.360
No, I mean it, Claire.
Have you slept?

12:32.680 --> 12:34.840
There's nothing you could've done
about Dad, OK?

12:36.560 --> 12:38.400
Do you really think,
if you'd gone to meet him,

12:38.480 --> 12:42.320
-things would've been any different?
-We'll never know.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.160
It was selfish.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.000
-He was always selfish.
-He was still our dad.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.960
I'm gonna go and sit in the car.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.520
I won't be a sec.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.120
Are you OK?

12:59.200 --> 13:03.600
I've been wanting to talk to you for days,
but I had to look you in the eye.

13:09.800 --> 13:14.600
We found it, Rob. Mum found the knife.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.040
Knife? What are you talking about?

13:20.120 --> 13:23.680
The bloodstained knife you hid
in your bedroom, in the fireplace.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.440
Mum found it, and...

13:27.360 --> 13:29.960
I threw it to the bottom of Glenarvon Loch

13:30.040 --> 13:32.760
because I didn't want to lose
the only brother I have left.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.520
I helped cover up that man's murder,

13:35.600 --> 13:39.480
so the least you can do is admit it.
Admit you killed Lee Walsh.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.840
Claire, I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.640
-Don't lie to me.
-I'm not!

13:48.080 --> 13:50.360
It was in your room, Rob.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.840
-Mum found it in your room.
-It wasn't me.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.920
I never hid anything there.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.320
Like being in a slalom,
driving on these roads.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.600
How is she? Maddy?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.920
As you'd expect.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.560
-Bloody tragedy, that girl, eh?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.720
-Huh.
-What?

15:39.680 --> 15:41.040
Morning.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.200
Good morning. What is it?

15:44.280 --> 15:46.760
I... I just wanted to let you know,

15:46.840 --> 15:50.240
at the funeral,
there will be CID officers.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.640
Just to keep an eye on things,
in case Walsh shows up.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.960
They'll be plainclothes.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.600
Right.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.320
Well, thank you, um...

16:01.480 --> 16:04.480
And thank you very much
for releasing the...

16:04.560 --> 16:06.640
the... bodies so quickly.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.240
It means a lot to us.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.680
Mrs. Elliot, I heard about
your ex-husband. I'm...

16:11.760 --> 16:13.560
I'm very sorry about what happened.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.000
Well...

16:17.400 --> 16:20.960
he always managed to let the world
get on top of him.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.880
Did you know Adam called him
while he was on his honeymoon?

16:27.760 --> 16:28.800
No.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.840
Are you sure?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.960
Phone records showed a call.
It seemed unusual.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.480
Your daughter said
nobody spoke to him.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.000
But if anybody was going
to give Peter a chance,

16:40.080 --> 16:42.880
it would be Adam, I suppose.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.280
What's any of this got to do
with what's happened?

16:46.360 --> 16:47.880
Why are you here?

16:47.960 --> 16:50.600
Just tying up loose ends.
I wanted to ask you...

16:50.680 --> 16:52.720
When I saw you that day, you said...

16:53.760 --> 16:57.240
you hadn't left the house all morning,
but here, in this picture,

16:57.320 --> 16:59.520
you're over at the Douglas farm.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.680
Still wearing your slippers.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.040
Oh, right. Yeah, well, I mean...

17:06.119 --> 17:07.920
Listen, I was all over the place,
you know.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.319
I mean, I'd just lost my son,
you know, I wasn't...

17:11.400 --> 17:13.680
-I wasn't exactly, um...
-I understand.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.720
[Louise] Yeah, I mean...

17:17.200 --> 17:21.040
It was... early, and we couldn't sleep...

17:22.280 --> 17:24.800
So all of us went for a walk.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.359
It was a tradition
that the two families...

17:28.440 --> 17:30.800
We used to do it together.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.440
So I... I suppose we did it
to honor Adam and Grace.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.000
Where did you walk?

17:40.080 --> 17:41.920
Oh. Well, we just...

17:42.000 --> 17:45.560
We met at the barn, or near the barn,
and we, um...

17:45.640 --> 17:47.920
We just circled the property.
We, um...

17:48.000 --> 17:51.200
Down at the back, at the foot of the hill,
and then round.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.120
Why, does it matter?

17:54.160 --> 17:58.720
-And the slippers?
-Well, as I said, I wasn't with it.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.120
There was a car when I was last here.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.800
Under some tarpaulin on the left,
just past the fork there?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
Oh, Rob's. That was Rob's.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.800
Yeah, he took it to be scrapped.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.240
Just a piece of old junk, really, it's...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.120
Detective, what do you want?

18:23.560 --> 18:25.480
I'm very sorry to have disturbed you.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.520
We'll let you know if we get
anything on Walsh.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.920
[Louise] Thank you.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.360
[breathes heavily]

18:38.440 --> 18:41.720
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

18:49.680 --> 18:52.960
Oh! [pants]

18:58.200 --> 19:01.520
[cellphone rings]

19:01.880 --> 19:04.840
[music plays over headphones]

19:06.960 --> 19:09.240
[ringing continues]

19:35.880 --> 19:37.640
[ringing continues]

19:45.960 --> 19:49.680
We actually came by to ask Mrs. Elliot
a few questions about her ex.

19:49.760 --> 19:54.240
-Aye. It's an awful thing. Awful.
-[Juliet] And while we're here,

19:54.320 --> 19:56.960
there was something
I was gonna ask you.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.800
Mrs. Elliot said that you all went
for a walk together the other day and...

20:00.880 --> 20:04.040
I just wanted to check with you
where it was that you went.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.400
It was that day that we came to see you.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.400
-Why does it matter where we walked?
-Dad!

20:09.480 --> 20:11.520
-Not now, Jamie.
-No, Dad, you need to...

20:11.600 --> 20:13.440
Jamie, go back inside.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.320
I won't ask you again!

20:15.400 --> 20:16.960
Now, go on!

20:17.040 --> 20:20.040
You were saying?
Where you walked that morning?

20:20.120 --> 20:21.360
Aye, uh...

20:22.400 --> 20:24.600
Right, let me think, um...

20:24.680 --> 20:28.200
We... We met at the, uh, the stile
up there between our two houses

20:28.280 --> 20:30.160
and then came down by the barn.

20:30.240 --> 20:35.680
Then round the house there
and up the path between the fields. Why?

20:36.720 --> 20:40.880
Just clearing up a few things.
I'm going to leave you in peace.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.800
I don't understand. What's this about?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.320
I'm just trying to be thorough.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.120
If you can, um... think of anything
that might help,

20:47.200 --> 20:49.480
please get in touch.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.960
[Andrew] Tenner for your thoughts?

21:07.040 --> 21:08.120
[Juliet] You heard it.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.560
Both of them said they went for that walk
in completely different directions.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.160
-[Andrew] Yeah. I heard it, but...
-If it's a family tradition

21:14.240 --> 21:17.000
like she said, that's not something
you'd get wrong.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.080
Between that and the car that was
there the morning we came...

21:21.120 --> 21:23.080
You still think we're wasting our time?

21:24.360 --> 21:26.080
You think Walsh made it here that night?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.480
What would you do...

21:30.440 --> 21:35.920
if the man who murdered your children
ended up on your doorstep that same day?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.440
-[Andrew] Call the police?
-[sighs heavily]

21:39.520 --> 21:42.200
That's easy to say,
but put yourself in their shoes.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.120
Really put yourself in them.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.760
You don't have a clue what you'd do.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.560
When it comes down to it,

21:53.240 --> 21:56.560
people are capable of doing things
they never thought they could do.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.760
[door unlocks]

22:19.240 --> 22:21.040
[pants]

22:28.680 --> 22:30.400
Your mum ironed it.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.200
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

22:34.280 --> 22:37.120
I think I heard her go out,
and Claire went back to work.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.000
[kisses her]

22:42.080 --> 22:45.840
It'll all be over tomorrow, at least.
That's what they say, isn't it?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.320
You say goodbye to people
at funerals.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.000
Some shit about closure.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.840
Hmm! Wouldn't it be nice
if that were true?

22:58.440 --> 23:01.360
-Anna, what's going on with you?
-What does that mean?

23:01.440 --> 23:06.480
It means... since everything happened,
you've barely spoken a word to me.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.840
There's nothing left to say.

23:09.760 --> 23:14.760
-What happened... happened.
-Yeah, but you can talk to me.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.440
-You can trust me.
-I know.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.040
[Rob] Haven't I always
tried to protect you?

23:19.120 --> 23:21.280
I don't need protecting!

23:23.200 --> 23:25.760
-Is there something you wanna tell me?
-What are you getting at?

23:25.840 --> 23:28.080
I'm getting at you
being honest with me.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.600
You hid it in the fireplace, didn't you?

23:34.880 --> 23:37.000
-What?
-The knife.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.840
The bloody knife that Mum found.
The one that slit Lee Walsh's throat.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.000
There was no one else
in the room with me, Anna.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.160
Look, I'm not angry. Look at me.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.360
-I just want you to tell the truth.
-Oh!

23:48.440 --> 23:49.920
Just tell me.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.080
[Bill] It's been a week now.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.680
All we need is to keep our nerve.
Keep silent.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.600
But what if they come in and search
the place? What if they find the...

24:03.680 --> 24:07.400
They need more than suspicion
to get a search warrant, Louise.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.400
-You need to calm down.
-OK.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.960
Don't let it get the better of you,
Louise. For all our sakes.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.120
-[Louise] OK.
-Right?

24:16.200 --> 24:17.280
[door opens]

24:19.000 --> 24:20.040
A word, Bill?

24:21.240 --> 24:22.400
Aye.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.480
[Alastair] Louise Elliot OK?

24:33.560 --> 24:36.080
[Bill] Her world's falling apart
at the seams.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.120
-You heard what happened to Peter.
-Aye.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.760
Can't say I'll be losing any sleep
over it, mind.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.720
-A good man, but a weak one.
-What brings you here, Alastair?

24:47.880 --> 24:49.480
I gave you time off.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.960
I want more. More money.

24:55.320 --> 24:59.760
You came to me and asked me
for what you were owed.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.040
I gave you what I had.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.440
I'm sorry.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.840
But I need the money.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.800
-Sal and me...
-Ah, so this is Sal's idea, is it?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.280
A woman who couldn't be bothered
to send as much as a postcard

25:13.360 --> 25:15.080
when we lost wee Grace.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.360
No, listen, Sal and me were--

25:17.440 --> 25:20.280
So this is what it comes to,
is it, Alastair?

25:20.360 --> 25:22.840
This is what it boils down to, uh?

25:24.040 --> 25:25.760
Thirty years of friendship.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.760
It's nothing I haven't worked for.
You know that.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.640
I'm not Peter Elliot.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.000
I'm not a weak man.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.520
And I'm not going to let
you bleed me dry.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.000
You've lied along with the rest of us.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.240
You've had every opportunity
to go to the police

25:43.320 --> 25:44.640
and tell them what happened.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.520
And I'm willing to take my chances that
you'll continue to keep your mouth shut,

25:48.600 --> 25:50.720
to save your own hide.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.520
Because I know you, Alastair.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.440
And that's the mistake you've made.

26:03.640 --> 26:07.560
[Meredith] You see, I just don't
understand all this Facebooking nonsense.

26:07.640 --> 26:11.360
How can you have a proper relationship
with someone so far away?

26:13.640 --> 26:14.960
Well...

26:15.960 --> 26:17.680
Something like this.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.320
[Meredith] Oh, my!
I don't need to see that!

26:25.400 --> 26:26.800
[laughs]

26:28.040 --> 26:30.920
That's the first time I've heard
you laugh since it happened.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.920
I almost feel guilty.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.360
What's wrong?

26:41.760 --> 26:44.000
My brother Rob did something...

26:46.600 --> 26:50.160
No, um... It doesn't matter.
I shouldn't.

26:50.240 --> 26:55.360
Whatever it is you're carrying around,
you will have to talk to someone.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.560
You should talk to that boy Sam about it.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.640
You'll feel better, trust me.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.720
But tell him to put some trousers on.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.040
Nobody needs to see that.
Horrible little chicken legs!

27:09.120 --> 27:10.720
You old bat!

27:11.600 --> 27:14.480
-Right, you're going in a ditch!
-Oh, no! [laughs]

27:20.080 --> 27:21.600
[sighs]

27:21.680 --> 27:24.560
There's nothing in the financials,
as far as I can see.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.280
-Anything in the phone records?
-Not really.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.640
Just the calls from the hotel phone
to Adam's dad

27:32.720 --> 27:36.280
and a few from his mobile
to Bill Douglas.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.760
Could be Grace. Calling her dad.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.120
Absolutely nothing to tie
any of them to Lee Walsh.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.800
-Weird.
-Yeah, Andrew. It's weird.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.760
My ex hated dogs.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.560
But when one come up to her
on the street,

27:50.640 --> 27:53.040
she'd stroke it and smile at the owner.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.520
"Aw, nice boy!" You know?

27:55.640 --> 27:57.520
What?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.800
People do weird things, is my point.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.400
There's not always a neat explanation.

28:03.480 --> 28:07.360
Maybe Walsh was just a nut-job
with a psycho thing for Grace Elliot.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.080
[sighs] Goodnight.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.800
Goodnight.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.560
[birdsong]

28:32.080 --> 28:36.120
[Rob on video]<i> Here he is.</i>
<i>Any words for the bride and groom?</i>

28:37.160 --> 28:38.960
<i>-Uh...</i>
-[Rob]<i> Words of wisdom?</i>

28:39.040 --> 28:40.800
<i>Well, we already wrote something.</i>

28:40.880 --> 28:42.400
<i>In the card. It's in the card.</i>

28:42.480 --> 28:45.920
[Sal]<i> We wish you the best.</i>
<i>Both of you.</i>

28:46.000 --> 28:48.640
[Rob]<i> Can't say fairer than that.</i>
<i>You look wonderful.</i>

28:48.720 --> 28:50.520
<i>Ah! Mother!</i>

28:50.600 --> 28:52.120
[Claire weeps]

28:54.200 --> 28:57.320
[organ plays "Here Comes the Bride"]

29:12.960 --> 29:14.600
[sniffs]

29:16.040 --> 29:18.040
[text alert]

30:14.200 --> 30:15.680
Hey.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.440
I just got off the phone with, um, Leah.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.480
Dad's new wife?

30:25.480 --> 30:26.840
Jesus.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.000
She seemed quite nice.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.880
Wanted to talk about arrangements
and stuff, but...

30:35.200 --> 30:36.480
Then she said...

30:36.560 --> 30:38.240
She asked me why.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.040
Like, why he did it.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.960
As if I know.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.600
I just keep thinking...

30:47.720 --> 30:50.480
maybe he knew something...
about what happened to Adam and Grace.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.640
Claire...

30:51.720 --> 30:54.960
The way he was talking when he called
me, and he was coming up here.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.120
It sounded like he wanted
to tell me something.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.600
And on his honeymoon,
Adam calls him.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.640
-Why, after all these years?
-Claire, we've been down this road.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.320
We hardly knew Dad. Not anymore.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.920
-What if he was the reason?
-Stop.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.000
OK? Just stop.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.960
We'll drive ourselves mad
thinking like this.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.200
Where's Mum? We're gonna be late.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.840
I'll get her.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.320
[Rob sighs]

31:36.440 --> 31:37.480
Mum?

31:40.880 --> 31:42.000
Oh, Mum.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.720
We need to go soon,
we can't be late.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.240
I know, I know.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.800
[Louise sighs]

31:54.880 --> 31:58.520
I was...
trying to decide what to wear

31:58.600 --> 32:01.040
and... then I realized...

32:02.240 --> 32:03.960
it doesn't bloody matter.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.320
Adam doesn't give a damn whether
I wear the...

32:09.400 --> 32:13.000
stupid dress... or the skirt or the...

32:16.160 --> 32:19.800
He doesn't give a damn
whether I go to his funeral.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.160
[sobs]

32:30.560 --> 32:32.040
Maybe not.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.040
But I do.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.800
Here, here.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.200
It's all...

32:47.320 --> 32:49.680
It must be the stress or something.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.680
I still can't believe it.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.440
I know she's gone, but...

33:01.800 --> 33:03.160
I can't believe it.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.480
Does that make any sense?

33:12.240 --> 33:15.160
They say when you have a limb
amputated, you can still feel it.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.480
And even though it's not there, you
can't... shake the sensation that it is.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.560
And the worst thing is that it...
it itches.

33:27.800 --> 33:32.560
It itches and it burns and it hurts
and... you can't do a thing about it.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.960
It's your brain, apparently.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.440
It's wired to think that your arm
or your leg is still there,

33:41.520 --> 33:43.440
and it can't accept that it isn't.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.840
It's like the world
doesn't make sense without it.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.360
Screw this!

34:20.199 --> 34:22.120
[man coughs nearby]

34:22.199 --> 34:25.239
Don't suppose any of yous has got
a charger on you?

34:28.360 --> 34:29.840
[car pulls up outside]

34:31.040 --> 34:32.600
[faint chatter of police radio]

34:34.800 --> 34:36.719
[second vehicle pulls up]

34:40.920 --> 34:42.080
[tires squeal]

34:53.600 --> 34:56.440
[officer] We're at the squat.
Got a pursuit up the stairs!

35:00.960 --> 35:03.440
[officers shout]

35:23.760 --> 35:25.040
[pants]

35:30.040 --> 35:32.160
-What is it?
-They found me, brother.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.800
Did you go the garage? Because I told you
I would bring you what you needed!

35:36.880 --> 35:39.360
No, no, some crackheads
must've seen me on the estate.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.120
Where are they?

35:42.200 --> 35:43.520
I think I lost them.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.320
-[door clangs]
-Ah, shit!

35:45.400 --> 35:46.920
Chuck the phone, OK?

35:47.000 --> 35:49.960
I will sort this.
Trust me, you will walk.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.240
Just keep your mouth shut, OK?

35:52.320 --> 35:54.480
Now chuck the phone. Now!

36:08.120 --> 36:09.160
[doorbell rings]

36:10.520 --> 36:13.480
-Maddy, can you get that?
-[Maddy] I'll get it!

36:22.560 --> 36:23.720
Who was it?

36:28.120 --> 36:29.680
Maddy, go to your room.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.600
-Why?
-Just go.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.360
Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.480
Me and your mum are going
to talk a wee bit of business. High five.

36:39.640 --> 36:40.880
OK.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.320
[door closes]

36:45.400 --> 36:47.160
What in the hell do you think
you're doing?

36:47.240 --> 36:50.360
Relax, Grandma. I only pay house calls
if I've got a good reason.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.120
My boy got hauled in.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.360
And much as I like to think
I'm a great boss,

36:56.440 --> 36:58.560
he's gonna start singin' my name.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.320
What do you expect me to do?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.440
-I can't stop your dealer talking.
-No.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.000
I wouldn't have thought so, anyway.
But me and you...

37:07.640 --> 37:10.680
we're in this together, like, aren't we?

37:12.160 --> 37:16.320
That stuff you gave me? It killed a lass.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.120
So... you've got responsibilities here.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.720
That girl stole the LSD from her brother,
that's his responsibility.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.680
-Not mine.
-Are you serious?

37:24.760 --> 37:28.040
If I hadn't sold you those tabs, you'd
have found them from somewhere else

37:28.120 --> 37:30.960
-and that girl would still be dead.
-OK.

37:31.040 --> 37:35.520
All I'm saying is, it's in your interest
to make sure I'm not arrested.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.680
I'm going to go to ground. Lay low.

37:39.760 --> 37:42.520
But if I get picked up
and put in a cage...

37:44.080 --> 37:45.480
[sighs]

37:45.560 --> 37:48.000
...then you sure as shit are, too.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.360
Say goodbye to your daughter for me.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.840
[indistinct] Right, hold on.
I've gotta go. Bye.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.640
-Hey, I was just about to call you.
-What's happened?

38:21.720 --> 38:23.760
I take it you've not checked your emails.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.640
We both received one this morning
from Jamie Douglas.

38:26.720 --> 38:31.120
It's a screen-grab from a messenger chat
between Claire Elliot and her boyfriend.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.120
-He sent this just now?
-Mm-hm.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.200
-It's not admissible.
-No.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.400
-But it's enough for a warrant.
-Being processed.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.400
And I've spoke to Inverness CID,
just in case.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.800
Look who woke up.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.480
[Rob] "Sunset and evening star

39:07.640 --> 39:09.720
And one clear call for me!

39:11.400 --> 39:14.480
And may there be
no moaning of the bar,

39:14.560 --> 39:16.880
When I put out to sea,

39:18.880 --> 39:22.360
But such a tide as moving
seems asleep,

39:22.440 --> 39:24.560
Too full for sound and foam,

39:26.200 --> 39:28.600
When that which drew from out
the boundless deep,

39:30.480 --> 39:32.480
Turns again home.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.600
<i>Twilight and evening bell...</i>

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
<i>And after that the dark!</i>

39:45.680 --> 39:48.560
<i>And may there be</i>
<i>no sadness of farewell,</i>

39:49.760 --> 39:51.600
<i>When I embark;</i>

39:52.720 --> 39:55.840
<i>For tho' from out our bourne</i>
<i>of Time and Place</i>

39:55.920 --> 39:57.880
<i>The flood may bear me far,</i>

39:59.600 --> 40:02.960
<i>I hope to see my Pilot face to face</i>

40:04.000 --> 40:05.800
When I have crossed the bar."

40:09.480 --> 40:11.960
[music plays over dialogue]

40:23.200 --> 40:26.640
-So you made it here after all?
-Aye, aye, Bill.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.920
Well, you know how much
Gracie meant to us.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.520
Sal and me.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.000
Of course we came.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.120
Aye. She'd have liked that.

40:36.640 --> 40:39.760
Listen, Alastair, there's no need for you
to come into work tomorrow.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.800
Or ever again.

40:53.640 --> 40:56.360
[voices over police radios]

41:31.240 --> 41:32.920
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.200
Look like you've been up
for about two years.

41:38.280 --> 41:39.960
[text alert]

41:42.360 --> 41:43.560
Sam?

41:46.280 --> 41:48.640
Whatever happened to just talking
to someone, eh?

41:48.720 --> 41:50.320
It's overrated.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.120
I wasn't lying to you...

42:03.360 --> 42:05.880
when I said I didn't know about
the knife in the fireplace.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.960
It wasn't me.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.360
It wasn't.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.600
So... How did it get there?

42:23.880 --> 42:26.160
I wasn't staying in my room alone.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.520
Anna?

42:28.840 --> 42:29.880
No.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.320
Since we came back to Edinburgh
she's barely said a word.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.400
This whole thing, she's...

42:39.000 --> 42:41.640
Something's happened to her.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.680
There's a darkness there.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.520
It's a side of her that I can't...

42:46.600 --> 42:48.200
I can't quite...

43:03.680 --> 43:06.280
Jamie, what do you think
you're doing?

43:06.360 --> 43:08.960
Today's a hard day for all of us,
but I don't want you drinking!

43:09.040 --> 43:12.560
-Ma, I'm 17.
-Yes, you're 17, not 18!

43:12.640 --> 43:14.480
Can you hear yourself?

43:15.480 --> 43:17.360
You think I've never drunk before?

43:18.640 --> 43:20.480
You've got blinkers on.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.800
-What if your father sees you?
-Right.

43:22.880 --> 43:26.240
We should all do what Dad says,
cos he's such a saint.

43:31.520 --> 43:35.080
I know you're upset. We all are.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.920
But there's no need for this, Jamie.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.400
He's been lying to you,
did you know that?

43:40.720 --> 43:42.320
Just stop.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.200
Please, just stop. Not today.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.960
He's got Parkinson's.

43:50.160 --> 43:52.080
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.880
He found out months ago.

43:55.280 --> 43:58.440
Then he said me and Grace
had to get tested,

43:58.520 --> 44:00.440
to see if we had it too.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.640
It's true.

44:04.720 --> 44:08.880
It's true. And I'm sick and tired
of all these lies.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.280
That's why I contacted the police
and told them

44:16.360 --> 44:19.160
about what happened to Lee Walsh.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.040
-You did what?
-Don't worry.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.480
I kept us out of it.

44:24.560 --> 44:28.440
I said in my email that all we knew
was Rob coming by the house,

44:28.520 --> 44:31.840
talking about someone crashing
into the fence.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.160
As far as the police know,
we had no idea what went on.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.000
Oh, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie...

44:38.240 --> 44:40.200
What have you done?

45:23.560 --> 45:25.720
[dog barks]

46:27.680 --> 46:29.360
Mrs. Elliot.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.720
What are you doing here?

46:35.800 --> 46:38.120
[Juliet] I'm so sorry to do this today.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.280
-I really am.
-Have you found Lee Walsh?

46:42.280 --> 46:44.920
We're going to need to speak to you all
down at the station.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.400
-But wh-what for?
-Let's talk more at the station, eh?

46:47.480 --> 46:50.200
I don't understand. Why can't you
just tell us what this is all about?

46:50.280 --> 46:51.800
Why don't you just come with us?

46:51.880 --> 46:54.360
[Rob] Anything you have to say to us,
you can say here.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.720
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm burying my brother.

46:56.800 --> 47:00.200
This is about Lee Walsh,
and it can't wait.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.600
-Have you found him?
-[Andrew] Just come with us now.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.640
Let's not make a scene, eh?

47:31.240 --> 47:33.560
[Louise]<i> There was this, uh, crash,</i>

47:33.640 --> 47:35.720
and a car came off the road.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.840
We helped the man inside.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.000
We were trying to help him,

47:42.080 --> 47:44.040
then we called an ambulance,

47:44.120 --> 47:46.440
but the storm was...

47:47.640 --> 47:50.960
They said it would take a while
to come.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.080
[Claire]<i> I needed some supplies</i>

47:53.160 --> 47:57.600
to help him,
so we sent Rob over to Bill's farm.

47:57.680 --> 48:01.840
While he was away
we found a note in his pocket.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.680
It had our postcode on it.

48:04.800 --> 48:06.160
We're going to need to see that.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.080
I didn't bring it.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.880
I thought I was only going
to my brother's funeral.

48:14.840 --> 48:17.920
And when did you realize
who the man from the car was?

48:18.000 --> 48:21.040
We were on our way back
from the barn, the news was on.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.600
The suspect in Adam and Gracie's murder.

48:27.760 --> 48:30.200
Rob looked like
he'd just seen a ghost.

48:31.760 --> 48:33.280
He said he recognized the man.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.400
He ran out. Angry.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.720
Mum and Dad went out, following him.

48:40.720 --> 48:44.040
He'd gone to get the guy. Walsh.

48:44.120 --> 48:45.720
We went to look in on him and he'd gone.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.240
[Andrew] Mr. Walsh?

48:48.720 --> 48:51.960
So we went out into the storm
and we found him.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.240
Did he say anything?

48:55.960 --> 48:59.200
No, he was too unwell.
He couldn't speak.

48:59.280 --> 49:03.360
We took him back to the Douglas farm.
Out of the storm, you know.

49:04.400 --> 49:09.240
And did you talk about what you should do,
now that he was here, in your house?

49:09.320 --> 49:12.800
There was an ambulance
supposed to be on the way.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.480
And we agreed we'd call the police.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.440
We'd keep Walsh locked up
until the police arrived.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.160
Who went to call the police?

49:23.240 --> 49:26.240
I couldn't bring myself to. Not for him.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.320
We received an email from Jamie Douglas.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.760
He came into possession of
an online conversation

49:31.840 --> 49:34.000
your sister had with a friend.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.680
Sam, I think his name was.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.640
She said,
"My brother's done something terrible."

49:42.040 --> 49:43.800
What was she talking about?

49:46.480 --> 49:47.800
I think I'd like a lawyer.

49:47.880 --> 49:50.200
[Andrew] If that's the way you wanna go,
we could do that.

49:50.280 --> 49:55.000
Look, I just want to get to the bottom
of what happened to Adam and Grace.

49:56.520 --> 50:00.200
Why did Lee Walsh come up
to your house in the first place?

50:01.680 --> 50:03.520
How was your dad involved?

50:05.160 --> 50:07.040
Did he know Walsh?

50:07.120 --> 50:09.960
We're going to find out what happened.

50:10.040 --> 50:12.280
Forensics have been there for hours.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.080
We'll find the truth.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.800
Isn't it better to get in front of it...

50:20.880 --> 50:23.680
Look, I did it. OK?

50:25.160 --> 50:26.640
I killed him.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.520
[PA]<i> Well, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

50:43.600 --> 50:45.360
<i>thank you very much for traveling</i>
<i>with us.</i>

50:45.440 --> 50:47.840
<i>We're now arriving</i>
<i>at Victoria Coach Station.</i>

50:47.920 --> 50:51.200
<i>Welcome to London,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

50:51.280 --> 50:52.760
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

51:12.200 --> 51:13.760
Thank you.

51:20.600 --> 51:23.320
Your brother just confessed
to the murder of Lee Walsh.

51:28.240 --> 51:31.280
You, your mum and Anna,
and the Douglas family,

51:31.360 --> 51:34.320
you'll be kept here overnight
and you'll be charged in the morning

51:34.400 --> 51:36.680
with attempting to pervert
the course of justice.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.400
Most likely you'll be granted bail.

51:39.480 --> 51:42.400
This probably won't come
to trial for a few months.

51:44.960 --> 51:46.920
Even with all of this...

51:50.440 --> 51:55.200
I'm glad that the man
that murdered my brother...

51:57.680 --> 51:59.120
is dead.

52:14.800 --> 52:16.040
[Moira] How are you holding up?

52:16.120 --> 52:19.400
I ordered us a taxi to take us
to the station. Shouldn't be too long.

52:20.640 --> 52:22.480
So do I get an apology, then?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.800
I think you've got that
the wrong way round.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.640
You both thought I did it.

52:29.720 --> 52:33.480
Neither of you believed me, no matter
how many times I tried to tell you.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.440
Now you know.
So you owe me an apology.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.480
-Not now, Jamie.
-So when?

52:38.560 --> 52:41.360
When are you gonna stop treating me
like I'm still the same person I was

52:41.440 --> 52:43.600
-when I was 13?
-You listen to me.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.400
You shut your mouth,
and you keep it shut!

52:47.440 --> 52:50.000
No matter what your mother and me thought,
we believed in you.

52:50.080 --> 52:52.880
We tried to protect you.
And what do you do in return?

52:52.960 --> 52:56.360
You tell your mother about my condition
on the day of Gracie's funeral.

52:56.440 --> 52:59.640
Is that how she needed to find out
that I was dying?

52:59.720 --> 53:02.240
-I don't need protecting, Bill!
-That's not what I was doing.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.160
I am a lot tougher
than you give me credit for.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.160
I know that!

53:09.000 --> 53:10.640
I wanted to tell you.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.280
But I couldn't. Alright, love?

53:16.280 --> 53:17.720
I just didn't know how.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.560
You lied to me.

53:21.560 --> 53:24.720
And you had Jamie lie to me, too.
And Gracie.

53:26.640 --> 53:28.560
You happy now?

53:28.640 --> 53:30.280
I wanted the police to know the truth.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.840
By sending them Claire's private emails?

53:32.920 --> 53:35.960
It wasn't emails, Dad.
I knew her password, that's all.

53:36.040 --> 53:40.080
You violated someone's privacy
because of a pathetic schoolboy crush!

53:40.160 --> 53:42.840
Now you listen to me,
and you listen to me good.

53:42.920 --> 53:45.440
You keep your mouth shut,
keep it shut,

53:45.520 --> 53:49.480
and don't you have the gall
to lecture me about trust anymore.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.960
Do you hear me?

54:01.720 --> 54:04.520
[breathes heavily]

54:46.880 --> 54:49.280
I'm going to the prison.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.360
That's where they said
they've... taken Rob.

54:53.800 --> 54:57.200
Good. You should go.

55:19.960 --> 55:22.960
[party noise
and "Take On Me" by A-Ha on video]

55:39.040 --> 55:40.760
<i>Can you do me a favor?</i>

55:41.920 --> 55:44.840
<i>Could you just go outside and, uh...</i>

55:45.840 --> 55:48.920
<i>just get some shots of the building,</i>

55:49.000 --> 55:50.600
<i>and the car, and just... stuff</i>

55:50.680 --> 55:54.040
<i>so that when I put it all together,</i>
<i>it'll be easier.</i>

55:54.120 --> 55:56.080
<i>Be easier to edit.</i>

55:56.160 --> 55:57.320
<i>Is that OK?</i>

56:11.400 --> 56:14.720
<i>Here. Take it with you. Read it.</i>

56:19.000 --> 56:21.800
<i>Carry on and you're going</i>
<i>straight to hell!</i>

56:37.400 --> 56:38.640
Bill!

56:42.440 --> 56:43.680
Bill.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.200
Bill!

56:48.600 --> 56:50.680
You remember Rob taped
Adam and Grace's wedding.

56:50.760 --> 56:52.840
Him and a bunch of friends
filmed the whole thing.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.480
I've been watching it.
Me and Mum have.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.960
It's full of things that aren't
in the final version.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.080
Alright, slow down, slow down.

56:59.160 --> 57:01.320
I saw something on that tape...

57:02.200 --> 57:04.040
You and Adam having an argument.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.920
You handed him something and you told him
he was going straight to hell.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.080
-Why?
-Does it matter?

57:10.560 --> 57:12.200
Tell me the truth, Bill.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.600
Is this something to do
with why Adam was killed?
