00:38.030 --> 00:39.389
Your throat feel any better?

00:39.769 --> 00:41.529
Oh, why'd I have to get mono?

00:41.629 --> 00:43.773
Well, it's called "The kissing disease" For a reason.

00:43.808 --> 00:47.256
I assume you and max were...
I'm going to stop right there.

00:47.746 --> 00:49.216
I think that's best.

00:49.575 --> 00:50.755
Make you some tea.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.499
Sorry about this.

00:52.534 --> 00:53.899
I know this wasn't what you expected

00:53.934 --> 00:55.263
When you asked to stay here

00:55.298 --> 00:57.167
While your place was being fumigated.

00:57.202 --> 01:00.291
Alexis was supposed to be going to
Paris with her mother.

01:00.301 --> 01:01.761
It's fine.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.070
Mm. Okay. Well...

01:03.105 --> 01:04.470
I'll get it.

01:04.968 --> 01:06.239
If you wanted to stay in a hotel,

01:06.274 --> 01:07.473
I would completely underst... no.

01:07.508 --> 01:09.857
I'm not gonna leave you just 'cause
your daughter's sick.

01:09.867 --> 01:10.752
Richard.

01:10.787 --> 01:13.646
I am gonna make this up to you in so many ways.

01:13.681 --> 01:14.985
Richard.

01:15.005 --> 01:16.085
What?

01:16.225 --> 01:18.674
Your ex-wife is here.

01:20.483 --> 01:22.083
- Meredith?
- Mom?

01:22.118 --> 01:23.712
Hello, kitten.

01:23.862 --> 01:25.691
Uh, what...what are you doing here?

01:25.726 --> 01:26.756
Alexis.

01:26.791 --> 01:28.590
Oh, my poor baby.

01:28.950 --> 01:30.469
Aren't you supposed to be in paris?

01:30.504 --> 01:31.644
Not without my daughter.

01:31.679 --> 01:33.208
And since you can't go to paris,

01:33.243 --> 01:34.748
I'm bringing paris to you...

01:34.758 --> 01:36.962
French pastries and "Funny face."

01:36.997 --> 01:39.566
We can enjoy them as I nurse you back to health.

01:42.604 --> 01:44.254
Meredith, how...why...

01:44.289 --> 01:45.643
Why so much luggage?

01:51.231 --> 01:53.305
I cannot believe that you are actually

01:53.340 --> 01:55.379
Letting your ex-wife stay with you, with us.

01:55.389 --> 01:57.369
What was I supposed to do, stick her in a hotel?

01:57.404 --> 01:58.278
Yes.

01:58.948 --> 02:00.777
Look, I get her taking care of alexis.

02:00.812 --> 02:01.959
But staying at your place?

02:01.994 --> 02:03.071
Okay, wait. Hang on.

02:03.106 --> 02:05.185
I turned to you, I said, "Is it all right with you?"

02:05.195 --> 02:06.305
And then you said "Yes."

02:06.340 --> 02:07.801
What am I supposed to say?

02:07.836 --> 02:09.229
Everyone is looking at me.

02:09.264 --> 02:11.423
I'm not meant to be the bad guy in this case.

02:11.458 --> 02:12.523
You are.

02:12.902 --> 02:15.072
Besides, I gave you the look.

02:15.122 --> 02:16.721
- What look?
- The look look.

02:17.311 --> 02:18.290
My look.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.080
Please don't tell me, after four years,

02:20.115 --> 02:21.439
You don't actually know the look.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.174
You gotta understand...

02:22.209 --> 02:24.078
You know what? I'm not talking about this right now.

02:24.798 --> 02:26.007
Good morning, lanie.

02:26.117 --> 02:28.606
Not from the way you sound. What's wrong?

02:29.236 --> 02:31.090
Men are clueless.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.944
Men or just Castle?

02:34.204 --> 02:36.658
Well, no matter how miserable your day is,

02:36.693 --> 02:39.072
it's not as bad as Michelle Twohey's.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.531
She took an ice pick to the side of the neck.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.486
Michelle Twohey,

02:42.521 --> 02:44.270
the divorce lawyer for the rich and famous?

02:44.305 --> 02:46.484
Isn't she the one that only represented women?

02:46.519 --> 02:49.898
And strikes fear into the heart
of many a soon-to-be ex-husband.

02:49.933 --> 02:51.764
There's something else. When I got here,

02:51.799 --> 02:53.957
she had a piece of paper clutched in her hand

02:53.992 --> 02:56.115
with a name and an address. Ryan.

02:56.265 --> 02:58.224
The name on the paper is "R. Garrison."

02:58.259 --> 02:59.319
It's a Scarsdale address,

02:59.354 --> 03:01.118
but it's not in our victim's contact numbers.

03:01.153 --> 03:03.018
Yo, there's a night clerk around the corner

03:03.052 --> 03:05.362
who saw a man fleeing the scene at 11:45 p.m.

03:05.397 --> 03:07.493
Suspect ducked into that subway entrance over there.

03:07.528 --> 03:09.288
We're pulling video from the security cameras,

03:09.323 --> 03:11.049
and the clerk's gonna sit with a sketch artist.

03:11.084 --> 03:12.166
What about the victim's family?

03:12.201 --> 03:13.213
Not anyone local.

03:13.248 --> 03:15.737
Her office gave me the boyfriend's number.

03:15.772 --> 03:17.212
A guy named Corey Francis.

03:17.247 --> 03:20.186
Okay, you guys see how R. Garrison figures into this.

03:20.221 --> 03:21.825
Castle and I will take the boyfriend.

03:23.294 --> 03:24.239
So, Corey,

03:24.274 --> 03:26.483
how long had you and Michelle been dating?

03:26.803 --> 03:28.133
Oh, less than a month.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.702
I don't know. We met, we just...

03:31.781 --> 03:32.901
It was like magic.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.849
When was the last time you spoke with her?

03:35.884 --> 03:36.999
Over the weekend.

03:37.269 --> 03:38.793
She was in the middle of a divorce case.

03:38.828 --> 03:41.207
I'm sure in her line of work,
she made a lot of enemies.

03:41.242 --> 03:43.217
Was there anyone in particular giving her trouble?

03:43.566 --> 03:44.676
I don't know.

03:44.856 --> 03:47.105
Her cases involved big money,

03:47.365 --> 03:48.769
big egos, but...

03:48.804 --> 03:51.053
she was just doing her job. She didn't deserve this.

03:51.088 --> 03:52.303
We had a witness who saw somebody

03:52.338 --> 03:54.142
running away from the crime scene.

03:54.732 --> 03:56.711
Do you recognize this man?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.319
No. He...he doesn't look familiar.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.528
We found a Scarsdale address on her.

04:04.563 --> 04:07.257
Does the name R. Garrison sound familiar?

04:08.027 --> 04:09.106
No.

04:09.176 --> 04:10.996
No, I-I never heard her mention it.

04:13.744 --> 04:15.244
Man. Look at this place.

04:15.554 --> 04:16.718
Eh. It's all right.

04:16.753 --> 04:18.322
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

04:18.642 --> 04:20.411
It has always been a dream of mine

04:20.447 --> 04:22.181
to come home to a house like this.

04:22.216 --> 04:23.156
Screw the house.

04:23.191 --> 04:24.620
It's always been a dream of mine...

04:24.655 --> 04:26.050
to come home to a woman like that.

04:29.698 --> 04:30.613
Right.

04:30.648 --> 04:32.637
Until, of course, things got serious,

04:32.672 --> 04:33.812
which is when you'd dump her

04:33.846 --> 04:35.806
and start looking for your next dream woman.

04:37.915 --> 04:38.820
NYPD, ma'am.

04:38.855 --> 04:40.684
I'm detective Ryan. This is detective Esposito.

04:40.719 --> 04:42.403
Just call me Javier.

04:42.623 --> 04:45.112
Is there an R. Garrison here?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.171
Yes, that's my husband Rob.

04:48.431 --> 04:49.325
Come on in.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.950
Hear that? "Husband"...

04:51.030 --> 04:52.699
- And suspect.
- Yeah.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.918
No, we've actually never met.

04:56.028 --> 04:58.357
Do you have any idea
why she had your name and address on her?

04:58.392 --> 05:00.686
Well, I gave it to her last night
when I spoke with her.

05:01.376 --> 05:03.670
I'm a forensic accountant. It's mostly bankruptcies.

05:03.705 --> 05:06.024
But I do a lot of consulting for divorce attorneys.

05:06.059 --> 05:08.353
So Ms. Twohey called me up, out of the blue,

05:08.363 --> 05:10.582
and wanted to meet and go over some financial issues.

05:10.617 --> 05:12.601
Whose financial issues, her own?

05:12.611 --> 05:13.721
She didn't say.

05:13.951 --> 05:16.195
But I recognized her name and I knew her reputation,

05:16.230 --> 05:18.249
so I assumed it was about one of her clients.

05:18.839 --> 05:20.938
It was an odd conversation, though.

05:21.098 --> 05:22.357
Odd? How do you mean?

05:22.917 --> 05:25.246
Well, she insisted on meeting today.

05:25.606 --> 05:26.970
So whatever the issues were,

05:27.005 --> 05:30.364
Ms. Twohey was a bit frantic
about getting them resolved quickly.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.498
Hmm. Look, if that meeting was about a client,

05:32.533 --> 05:33.988
then we gotta find out which one.

05:34.023 --> 05:35.407
So head down to her office

05:35.442 --> 05:37.491
and see what cases she was working on.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.285
And you know what?
Since Michelle only represented women,

05:40.320 --> 05:43.329
see if any of the men
she went up against threatened her.

05:44.229 --> 05:46.268
Yeah, men are known to do stupid things

05:46.303 --> 05:48.117
when it comes to their ex-wives.

05:48.857 --> 05:49.781
Okay.

05:49.816 --> 05:50.706
Thank you.

05:53.275 --> 05:54.829
Hey. I'll get that for you.

05:54.864 --> 05:56.224
That's okay. I got it.

05:58.253 --> 05:59.358
So just to let you know,

05:59.393 --> 06:01.242
I'm real sorry about that whole Meredith thing,

06:01.277 --> 06:04.601
But I am going to... take care of it.

06:07.239 --> 06:08.289
Beckett.

06:08.689 --> 06:10.128
Yeah. Okay. We'll be right there.

06:10.163 --> 06:11.568
Lanie's got something for us.

06:11.818 --> 06:13.587
You go deal with that. I'm gonna go deal with...

06:14.657 --> 06:15.916
The other thing.

06:18.025 --> 06:19.215
Take care of it.

06:19.325 --> 06:21.259
No. You've gotta take care of it.

06:21.294 --> 06:23.158
This is Meredith we're talking about...

06:23.193 --> 06:27.012
The deep-fried twinkie that Castle has ex-sex
with whenever she rolls into town.

06:27.047 --> 06:27.961
Lanie.

06:27.981 --> 06:29.526
Look, I trust him.

06:29.561 --> 06:31.070
He's not gonna have sex with her.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.125
Fine.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.269
Let's say it isn't about sex.

06:34.304 --> 06:35.588
It's about boundaries.

06:35.598 --> 06:37.213
Meredith is marking her territory.

06:37.248 --> 06:39.607
You can't just let her waltz
in and out whenever she pleases.

06:39.642 --> 06:42.166
He's in a catch-22. Alexis is sick...

06:42.201 --> 06:43.120
Doesn't matter.

06:43.155 --> 06:45.654
This is a war, girl, and guess who's losing.

06:46.444 --> 06:47.464
I don't know.

06:48.723 --> 06:49.668
Maybe you're right.

06:49.703 --> 06:51.707
Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.

06:51.742 --> 06:53.961
Lanie, I didn't come down here to talk about this.

06:53.971 --> 06:55.825
You said that you have something case related.

06:55.860 --> 06:58.239
Yes. Are you ready for some good news now?

06:58.429 --> 06:59.539
That would be nice.

06:59.939 --> 07:02.063
I processed the victim's clothing

07:02.098 --> 07:04.187
and found trace amounts of someone else's blood

07:04.207 --> 07:05.796
on her jacket button.

07:05.976 --> 07:08.435
Which means our killer could've gotten
cut during the attack.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.720
I'm running D.N.A. now.

07:09.755 --> 07:11.464
I'll call you when I got something.

07:12.853 --> 07:13.853
Thank you.

07:16.552 --> 07:18.791
So each one of Michelle's employees at her law firm

07:18.826 --> 07:20.021
alibied out.

07:20.031 --> 07:23.589
But they all said she'd been acting
odd during the past few weeks.

07:23.624 --> 07:25.229
They assumed it had to do with a case.

07:25.328 --> 07:26.253
Which case?

07:26.288 --> 07:27.218
Pick one.

07:27.228 --> 07:29.587
Introducing the wealthy men of Manhattan.

07:29.637 --> 07:31.076
Michelle represented all their wives

07:31.111 --> 07:32.281
in ongoing divorces,

07:32.316 --> 07:34.705
And some of these angry husbands had threatened her.

07:34.740 --> 07:37.094
The only problem is, none of 'em matched our sketch.

07:37.129 --> 07:38.418
Maybe that's because one of them

07:38.453 --> 07:40.782
hired our mystery man to kill Michelle.

07:40.842 --> 07:43.661
But we won't know which one until we find this guy.

07:43.696 --> 07:44.811
And I just did.

07:44.991 --> 07:46.115
On the subway security video,

07:46.150 --> 07:48.469
I saw our suspect swipe his M.T.A. Card.

07:49.649 --> 07:51.188
He used a credit card to buy it.

07:52.448 --> 07:53.482
Herman Poquille.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.392
A few B&Es, aggravated assault,

07:55.427 --> 07:57.606
Oh, and several attempted murders.

07:57.641 --> 07:59.785
Congratulations. You finally succeeded.

07:59.795 --> 08:01.059
Only thing is, we can't figure out

08:01.094 --> 08:02.884
why you'd want to kill Ms. Twohey.

08:02.894 --> 08:03.878
Purse wasn't stolen.

08:03.913 --> 08:05.872
The car wasn't jacked. So why'd you want to kill her?

08:05.907 --> 08:07.602
I didn't kill her. It's not what you think.

08:07.637 --> 08:08.891
Come on, Herman.

08:09.151 --> 08:11.040
You can talk to us. Someone hired you.

08:11.075 --> 08:12.370
Yeah, she did.

08:13.309 --> 08:14.839
Like I said. It's not what you think.

08:15.039 --> 08:16.438
I used to work for Michelle.

08:17.398 --> 08:18.457
Doing what?

08:18.677 --> 08:19.697
Photographer.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.096
Shots of husbands cheating
on their wives, stuff like that.

08:22.286 --> 08:23.311
That still doesn't explain

08:23.345 --> 08:24.985
what you were doing at the crime scene.

08:25.005 --> 08:25.904
Look,

08:26.154 --> 08:27.469
I botched an assignment a while ago,

08:27.504 --> 08:28.788
and Michelle fired me.

08:28.823 --> 08:30.038
Then all of a sudden, she's calling me,

08:30.073 --> 08:31.652
asking me for my help on some big job.

08:31.687 --> 08:32.702
What big job?

08:32.962 --> 08:34.030
She didn't say.

08:34.321 --> 08:35.591
She said she was heading home

08:35.626 --> 08:36.860
and would wait for me near the subway.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.578
By the time I got there, she was dead.

08:38.649 --> 08:40.749
I didn't want to get mixed up in a murder, so I ran.

08:43.158 --> 08:44.757
- You don't believe me?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.426
Check the texts on my phone.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.806
It's all there.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.445
So I went through Herman's phone,

08:49.480 --> 08:50.860
and he wasn't lying.

08:50.895 --> 08:53.224
Michelle wanted to hire him to take photos,

08:53.259 --> 08:54.838
and she seemed pretty desperate.

08:54.873 --> 08:56.482
Herman didn't want to take the job,

08:56.517 --> 08:58.192
and he kept texting her "No."

08:58.372 --> 09:00.901
But she seemed to finally win him over with this.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.420
Okay, Herman.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.329
My texts aren't changing your mind,

09:04.364 --> 09:05.739
so maybe this will.

09:06.568 --> 09:08.797
Look at me. I'm pleading.

09:09.447 --> 09:11.481
I have a huge problem, and I need you

09:11.516 --> 09:13.516
and that camera of yours for one last job.

09:13.551 --> 09:14.545
Please.

09:15.995 --> 09:17.944
A life hangs in the balance.

09:18.804 --> 09:20.473
"A life hangs in the balance"?

09:20.483 --> 09:22.502
What the hell did she need a photo of?

09:22.652 --> 09:24.675
YYeTs.com

09:24.810 --> 09:30.263
Castle s5e10
Significant Others

09:36.516 --> 09:37.201
Hi there.

09:37.236 --> 09:38.975
Did you catch the killer already?

09:39.010 --> 09:40.679
Uh, no. Not yet. How's Alexis?

09:40.714 --> 09:43.013
Mm, sleeping, but I'm gonna wake her with some soup.

09:43.048 --> 09:44.360
Want some?

09:44.395 --> 09:45.672
Oh. Um, no, thanks.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.561
Listen, Meredith,

09:48.691 --> 09:49.676
about you staying here...

09:49.711 --> 09:51.035
Thanks again, Richard.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.399
I can't tell you how much this means to me.

09:54.149 --> 09:55.078
Yeah.

09:55.118 --> 09:58.257
- It's just... Beckett and I...
- Are wonderful.

09:58.292 --> 09:59.502
It's so refreshing to see

09:59.537 --> 10:02.161
how secure you two are in your relationship.

10:02.196 --> 10:04.545
You know, most women would take issue with an ex-wife

10:04.580 --> 10:05.899
staying with their boyfriend.

10:05.934 --> 10:08.593
But not Kate Beckett. She gets it.

10:08.753 --> 10:10.187
Yeah. Kate gets it.

10:10.222 --> 10:12.811
Um, here's the thing, Meredith, I...

10:12.846 --> 10:14.491
I know.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.865
And...

10:15.900 --> 10:18.129
It isn't easy for me to admit...

10:19.109 --> 10:21.228
I haven't been the best of mothers.

10:21.263 --> 10:23.404
I've missed so much of our daughter's life.

10:23.439 --> 10:25.546
So the fact that you're letting me be here now

10:25.581 --> 10:28.160
for Alexis during her time of need,

10:28.195 --> 10:32.474
Richard, I'll never, ever forget this.

10:38.431 --> 10:40.500
Neither will Beckett.

10:48.677 --> 10:50.292
Well?

10:50.327 --> 10:51.576
Well, what?

10:51.611 --> 10:52.791
Oh, that.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.160
Still working on that.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.494
What about, uh, any progress

10:55.534 --> 10:57.164
on finding Michelle Twohey's killer?

10:57.584 --> 10:59.238
No, not yet.

10:59.273 --> 11:02.342
We're still checking on the ex-husbands' alibis.

11:02.377 --> 11:03.631
Hey, guys.

11:03.671 --> 11:07.530
Uh... I think we might have our theory backwards.

11:07.565 --> 11:09.069
What if it wasn't an angry ex-husband

11:09.104 --> 11:10.695
that killed Ms. Twohey?

11:10.730 --> 11:12.424
What if it was an ex-wife?

11:12.459 --> 11:14.117
Oh, wow. A troublesome ex-wife?

11:14.152 --> 11:15.612
Imagine that.

11:15.647 --> 11:17.896
So you think one of her clients killed her?

11:18.455 --> 11:19.770
Uh, well, Lanie got a hit

11:19.805 --> 11:21.344
on the blood found on Michelle's jacket.

11:21.379 --> 11:23.578
It belongs to a Samantha Voss.

11:23.613 --> 11:26.532
She's in the system due to a D.U.I.
Arrest in Los Angeles.

11:26.567 --> 11:27.947
Did she have a grievance with Michelle?

11:27.982 --> 11:30.121
Oh, I'd say so. The morning of Michelle's murder,

11:30.156 --> 11:31.115
a judge came down with a ruling

11:31.150 --> 11:32.850
in Samantha's contentious divorce case.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.569
She lost big.

11:34.604 --> 11:35.564
How big is big?

11:35.599 --> 11:37.128
Uh, upper east side apartment big.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.462
Cars and boats big.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.697
Half of her multimillion-dollar net worth big.

11:40.732 --> 11:41.411
That's big.

11:41.446 --> 11:43.570
Especially when Samantha went off
on a courtroom tirade,

11:43.605 --> 11:46.764
Accusing Michelle of screwing up her case.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.023
Of course my blood was on her.

11:50.058 --> 11:52.037
Michelle completely mishandled my divorce.

11:52.072 --> 11:54.681
I was furious. Our spat became physical,

11:54.716 --> 11:57.290
And I cut my hand on one of her metal jacket buttons.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.024
But I didn't kill her.

11:59.059 --> 12:01.328
- Mrs. Voss...
- Mrs. Voss is dead.

12:01.378 --> 12:04.447
I'm back to Ms. Peterman now, thank you.

12:04.482 --> 12:06.806
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:06.816 --> 12:08.611
Don't pack the china.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.405
That stays with my ex now.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.769
The jackhole.

12:11.804 --> 12:13.594
Ms. Peterman, where were you last night

12:13.604 --> 12:15.273
between 10:00 and 1:00?

12:15.308 --> 12:16.804
I was at a charity auction,

12:16.839 --> 12:18.302
which I chair,

12:18.337 --> 12:20.141
until 2:00 a.m.

12:28.028 --> 12:30.107
There are over a hundred donors who can vouch for that.

12:30.142 --> 12:32.146
Just check it out if you'd like.

12:32.256 --> 12:33.146
Well, you may not have killed Michelle,

12:33.176 --> 12:35.525
but you certainly murdered that original Zaozirny.

12:38.464 --> 12:40.168
I don't have to kill to get revenge.

12:40.203 --> 12:43.622
Not when there's so many other ways
to get back at my ex.

12:47.580 --> 12:48.755
Shame.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.889
That platter really tied the set together.

12:50.899 --> 12:53.778
Ms. Peterman, if you could just refrain

12:53.813 --> 12:55.292
from destroying anything else,

12:55.327 --> 12:56.681
you actually might be of some help.

12:56.716 --> 12:59.705
Now did Michelle say
or do anything out of the ordinary?

12:59.740 --> 13:00.970
Ooh, well, let me tell you,

13:01.005 --> 13:03.294
something was sure as hell wrong in that woman's life,

13:03.329 --> 13:04.823
because for the past month,

13:04.858 --> 13:06.912
she was just distracted.

13:07.742 --> 13:09.361
Distracted by what?

13:09.981 --> 13:11.516
She got lost in the details of my case

13:11.551 --> 13:14.075
that had absolutely no bearing
on securing a better settlement,

13:14.110 --> 13:16.599
and don't even get me started on her personal problems.

13:16.634 --> 13:17.883
What do you mean, her personal problems?

13:17.918 --> 13:21.037
Detective, I was her client, not her B.F.F.

13:21.072 --> 13:22.351
I don't know.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.141
Although I can tell you,

13:24.176 --> 13:26.944
yesterday she came to court late

13:26.979 --> 13:28.814
and she was...

13:29.333 --> 13:30.813
crying.

13:32.742 --> 13:33.897
Did she tell you why?

13:33.932 --> 13:36.651
Yes. She said that she was having
messy personal issues.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.567
What did you do to my Zaozirny?

13:45.602 --> 13:48.356
Oh, joy. My ex is home.

13:48.386 --> 13:49.725
Walter, Walter, Walter.

13:49.765 --> 13:51.875
Come in. We have company. Say hello.

13:52.314 --> 13:53.074
You bitch.

13:53.574 --> 13:54.139
No, dear.

13:54.174 --> 13:57.562
The bitch is the skank you paid to have sex with you.

14:00.671 --> 14:01.821
Walter, no.

14:01.831 --> 14:04.629
No, walter. No, walter!

14:10.947 --> 14:13.556
Next person to break anything

14:13.591 --> 14:15.535
goes to jail.

14:20.883 --> 14:22.332
This is all your fault.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.662
And it was so worth it.

14:25.621 --> 14:27.186
Hell hath no fury.

14:27.221 --> 14:28.820
Did it ever get that bad with either of your exes?

14:28.830 --> 14:31.089
No, no. Both my divorces were amicable.

14:31.124 --> 14:33.108
Yeah, a little too amicable.

14:35.097 --> 14:37.616
So something was going on with Michelle Twohey.

14:37.651 --> 14:38.851
On the morning of her death,

14:38.886 --> 14:40.825
she arrived to court late and she had been crying.

14:40.860 --> 14:43.059
So where was she coming from?

14:43.094 --> 14:44.279
Well, according to her financials,

14:44.314 --> 14:47.418
she paid for breakfast at a cafe right before court,

14:47.453 --> 14:50.521
so maybe someone there will let us know
what was so upsetting.

14:52.590 --> 14:53.995
Bro.

14:54.030 --> 14:55.399
What was that?

14:55.709 --> 14:56.464
What was what?

14:56.499 --> 14:57.638
Your girlfriend just uttered

14:57.673 --> 14:58.778
a sarcastic remark about your ex-wife,

14:58.788 --> 15:00.147
and all you're gonna say is "What was what?"

15:00.157 --> 15:01.642
Oh, that was nothing.

15:01.677 --> 15:03.386
- Spit it out.
- Tell us.

15:03.421 --> 15:05.167
Uh, okay. Uh, as you know...

15:05.202 --> 15:06.915
Beckett is staying at the loft

15:06.925 --> 15:08.029
while her place is getting fumigated.

15:08.064 --> 15:10.323
Alexis is home sick as well.
And then Meredith showed up,

15:10.358 --> 15:11.923
and she said she wanted to stay in the loft.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.592
And you said no.

15:15.851 --> 15:18.210
Tell me you said no.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.254
Really?

15:21.289 --> 15:24.168
Letting an ex stay with you
when you're with someone else?

15:24.203 --> 15:26.274
That's like throwing gasoline on fireworks.

15:26.309 --> 15:28.346
Come on. Guys, it... it's not that bad.

15:28.381 --> 15:30.341
Castle, you are on the edge

15:30.375 --> 15:32.595
of a very, very steep cliff, my friend.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.814
And if you don't do something about it quick...

15:36.323 --> 15:39.222
So the cafe owner remembers Michelle having an argument

15:39.257 --> 15:42.121
with a tall, good-looking man,
mid-30s, light brown hair,

15:42.156 --> 15:43.385
and blue eyes.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.669
Her boyfriend Corey Francis?

15:45.869 --> 15:47.689
I thought he said he hadn't seen
Michelle since the weekend.

15:47.724 --> 15:49.235
Now why would he lie?

15:49.270 --> 15:50.747
Looks like he's hiding something.

15:50.757 --> 15:52.947
Let's bring him down here and find out what?

16:02.403 --> 16:03.457
Yes, and if you could have

16:03.492 --> 16:06.591
some strawberries and champagne sent up there waiting.

16:06.991 --> 16:08.096
Perfect.

16:08.131 --> 16:11.239
Cedric, I owe you. Thank you.

16:11.549 --> 16:13.468
Michelle fights with her boyfriend,

16:13.503 --> 16:15.388
she sets up a meeting with an accountant,

16:15.398 --> 16:18.876
and then she hires a photographer.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.696
What the hell was she into?

16:20.731 --> 16:21.990
I don't know.

16:22.025 --> 16:24.239
But why don't we discuss it tonight in our

16:24.274 --> 16:26.623
oversized Jacuzzi at the Four Seasons,

16:26.658 --> 16:28.972
where I just booked us the ambassador suite.

16:29.007 --> 16:30.012
Why would you do that?

16:30.022 --> 16:32.261
Because your place is still being fumigated,

16:32.296 --> 16:34.365
and my loft is overrun with redheads.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.079
So I thought, why not just go and enjoy ourselves?

16:38.109 --> 16:39.788
You guys, where's Corey Francis?

16:39.823 --> 16:41.857
Well, we got a problem.

16:41.977 --> 16:43.212
He's disappeared.

16:43.247 --> 16:44.991
His cell has been disconnected,

16:45.026 --> 16:47.090
His address is bogus. So's his name.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.694
The guy that our victim was dating doesn't exist?

16:49.729 --> 16:51.993
What's worse, we have no way of finding him.

16:52.028 --> 16:53.822
No. Wait.

16:55.332 --> 16:56.496
He was wearing a ring.

16:56.531 --> 16:59.920
Class ring. College ring. A "New york" something.

16:59.955 --> 17:03.309
Uh, yeah, it was, uh, red
with a cathedral imprinted on it.

17:03.344 --> 17:04.313
The University of New York.

17:04.348 --> 17:05.867
Might be part of his cover identity.

17:06.777 --> 17:07.392
Come...

17:07.426 --> 17:09.080
University of New York? Come on.

17:09.116 --> 17:11.070
If you were gonna pick a cover identity,

17:11.106 --> 17:13.025
wouldn't you pick a better school than U...

17:13.954 --> 17:15.084
University of New York?

17:15.118 --> 17:15.848
Yeah.

17:15.884 --> 17:17.983
You know, we can I.D. him using the yearbooks.

17:18.018 --> 17:20.186
He's in mid-30s, so why don't we grab

17:20.222 --> 17:22.981
everything from the university library from '96 and on?

17:22.991 --> 17:24.535
Oh, well, that's, uh, upstate.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.499
- We'll have it for you in the morning.
- Yeah.

17:27.569 --> 17:28.714
No.

17:28.749 --> 17:29.823
No what?

17:29.858 --> 17:30.953
No on the Four Seasons.

17:30.988 --> 17:33.717
If anyone should be sent to a hotel, it's Meredith.

17:33.727 --> 17:35.061
Well, I tried. It just...

17:35.096 --> 17:37.025
It means so much to her to be there for Alexis,

17:37.060 --> 17:39.329
And, ah, it just seemed heartless

17:39.364 --> 17:41.389
to kick her out and send her to a hotel.

17:41.424 --> 17:44.082
Really, Castle? 'cause you just tried
sending me to one.

17:44.117 --> 17:45.062
No, but that was because...

17:45.097 --> 17:46.127
But nothing.

17:46.162 --> 17:49.120
Button up, kitten. We're going home.

18:02.614 --> 18:05.400
That smells delicious. Can I have a cup?

18:05.435 --> 18:08.186
I... was just making that for Castle.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.547
But, yeah, here.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.192
So how is Alexis?

18:13.227 --> 18:15.077
She's asleep. She's always asleep.

18:15.087 --> 18:16.358
I love her, but with mono,

18:16.393 --> 18:17.968
she's a bit of a bore.

18:19.820 --> 18:22.055
So you and Rick...

18:22.090 --> 18:24.291
Yes. Me and Rick.

18:24.326 --> 18:26.001
So...

18:26.571 --> 18:27.297
You know, uh,

18:27.332 --> 18:29.292
you might want to put some pants on.

18:29.327 --> 18:31.753
Why? It's not like I'm going anywhere.

18:34.003 --> 18:35.804
Hey, you two.

18:36.384 --> 18:37.410
What's going on?

18:37.445 --> 18:39.120
Nothing. Just making coffee.

18:39.155 --> 18:40.795
Here. This is for you.

18:40.830 --> 18:43.015
Oh, thank you.

18:46.927 --> 18:48.342
What is in this? Did you add...

18:48.377 --> 18:50.187
- Nutmeg?
- Nutmeg.

18:50.578 --> 18:51.853
Nutmeg?

18:51.888 --> 18:53.584
Whenever Rick pulled all-nighters,

18:53.619 --> 18:55.244
I'd sprinkle nutmeg in his coffee.

18:55.279 --> 18:57.930
Gave it an extra kick. You want to try?

18:57.965 --> 18:58.955
Uh, no, thanks.

18:58.990 --> 19:01.651
I think I've had enough kick for one morning.

19:02.261 --> 19:05.082
I will be at work.

19:22.817 --> 19:24.658
Listen, um...

19:25.927 --> 19:27.564
That whole coffee thing,

19:27.599 --> 19:29.089
Meredith didn't mean anything by that.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.579
She's just trying to be thoughtful.

19:30.614 --> 19:32.257
I'm sure she was.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.900
So you're not mad?

19:33.910 --> 19:34.786
About what?

19:34.821 --> 19:36.981
About how comfortable your ex-wife is in your home

19:37.016 --> 19:37.917
and with your family,

19:37.952 --> 19:40.112
how she seems to know things about you
that I don't know?

19:40.147 --> 19:41.167
Why would I be upset?

19:41.202 --> 19:43.943
Okay, see, this is
why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons,

19:43.978 --> 19:45.129
So you wouldn't have to deal with this.

19:45.164 --> 19:46.744
Castle, I shouldn't have to deal with this

19:46.779 --> 19:48.289
Because you should've said no.

19:48.324 --> 19:51.035
Yes, but I didn't, and now I can't.

19:51.205 --> 19:52.711
I know. I'll...

19:52.746 --> 19:54.746
I'll send Alexis and Meredith to the Four Seasons.

19:54.781 --> 19:56.221
I'll just hire a concierge doctor.

19:56.256 --> 19:58.042
No. Castle, I am a big girl, okay?

19:58.077 --> 20:00.897
I can be in the same place as your ex-wife.

20:00.932 --> 20:02.100
So you'll stay?

20:02.135 --> 20:03.234
Yeah. Sure.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.599
I'll just be subjected to her parading
around half naked.

20:06.619 --> 20:08.845
Oh. Okay. I can't win, can I?

20:08.880 --> 20:11.070
Oh, right. Because this is all about you.

20:11.105 --> 20:12.411
Well, you made it...

20:12.446 --> 20:14.071
If I...

20:15.842 --> 20:18.682
Okay, you know what? You're right.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.258
You are absolutely right.

20:21.293 --> 20:24.524
All we have to do is get through the next few days

20:24.559 --> 20:26.485
with my crazy ex-wife.

20:26.635 --> 20:28.056
What do you say?

20:28.091 --> 20:29.335
Noah.

20:29.346 --> 20:30.361
No?

20:30.396 --> 20:33.696
No, not "No." Noah Kesswood.

20:34.947 --> 20:36.808
Corey Francis is really...

20:36.843 --> 20:38.008
Noah Kesswood.

20:38.018 --> 20:40.669
Former officer
in the army's military intelligence corps.

20:40.679 --> 20:42.609
Former military intelligence?

20:42.910 --> 20:46.071
Noah uses a fake identity, starts dating Michelle,

20:46.106 --> 20:48.196
and then he disappears just after she's killed?

20:48.231 --> 20:49.636
It's "The bachelor" meets "Homeland."

20:49.671 --> 20:51.832
Whatever he was up to,
the only trace of him I could find

20:51.842 --> 20:54.032
is a loan-out corporation registered in his name.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.663
And there's been a lot of recent activity.

20:55.698 --> 20:57.348
Several large wire transfers were made

20:57.384 --> 21:00.104
from a local law firm... Benedict, Cole and Schuster.

21:00.139 --> 21:01.466
Those payments began around the time that

21:01.501 --> 21:02.760
Noah started dating Michelle.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.771
Think someone was paying Noah to spy on her?

21:04.806 --> 21:06.746
Well, Michelle's cases had outcomes in the millions.

21:06.756 --> 21:09.207
Maybe an opposing lawyer was angling for an advantage.

21:09.242 --> 21:11.193
If Michelle found out that she was being spied on,

21:11.228 --> 21:13.589
then that lawyer would face an ethics violation

21:13.624 --> 21:14.253
and disbarment.

21:14.288 --> 21:16.069
It might have made him desperate enough to pay Noah

21:16.104 --> 21:18.315
to kill Michelle to make the problem go away.

21:18.350 --> 21:20.850
It is possible, but the best way to find out

21:20.885 --> 21:23.351
is to track down the lawyer
that authorized those payments.

21:23.811 --> 21:24.841
Here. There's the napkins.

21:24.876 --> 21:26.741
Mr. Schuster.

21:26.761 --> 21:28.813
Your office said we'd find you down here.

21:28.848 --> 21:29.767
I'm Detective Esposito.

21:29.802 --> 21:31.464
This is my partner, Detective Ryan.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.089
I'm guessing you're not here for the hot dogs.

21:33.124 --> 21:35.584
We'd like you to come answer
some questions about Noah Kesswood.

21:35.619 --> 21:37.179
I'm sure you know I'm a criminal attorney

21:37.215 --> 21:38.806
who's very aware of his rights.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.471
I'm not going anywhere.

21:40.506 --> 21:41.891
Ah. Then we can talk here.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.197
You want to discuss the virtues
of processed meat in tube form?

21:45.232 --> 21:46.007
Fine.

21:46.017 --> 21:47.748
Otherwise, you're wasting your time.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.189
How about we discuss the wire transfers

21:49.224 --> 21:50.574
you made to Noah Kesswood,

21:50.609 --> 21:52.984
a suspect in the murder of Michelle Twohey?

21:53.019 --> 21:55.090
Save your foie gras, your roast duck,

21:55.125 --> 21:56.025
your coq au vin.

21:56.060 --> 21:58.026
For me, fine dining is a New York hot dog.

21:58.061 --> 22:00.671
Mr. Schuster, we know the last transfer
was for 10 grand,

22:00.706 --> 22:02.116
sent the morning Michelle was murdered.

22:02.151 --> 22:04.882
Sounds like your law firm paid
Noah to kill a fellow attorney.

22:04.917 --> 22:05.648
That's ridiculous.

22:05.683 --> 22:07.033
Maybe, but when we connect the dots,

22:07.043 --> 22:09.004
do you think the media will see it that way?

22:10.544 --> 22:11.420
Okay.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.320
Here's what's gonna happen, detectives.

22:13.355 --> 22:15.886
You're gonna find out that I was instructed by a client

22:15.896 --> 22:17.996
to pay Noah Kesswood for his service.

22:18.031 --> 22:19.587
You're gonna ask what that service was.

22:19.622 --> 22:21.162
I'm gonna say, "I don't know."

22:21.197 --> 22:24.198
Then you're gonna puff up
and demand the name of my client,

22:24.233 --> 22:27.288
to which I'll reply, "That's privileged information.

22:27.324 --> 22:29.105
Kindly go screw yourselves."

22:29.140 --> 22:31.921
Have a hot dog, boys. They're delicious.

22:33.451 --> 22:36.141
Mr. Schuster may have attorney-client privilege,

22:36.177 --> 22:38.574
but who he represents is a matter of public record.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.973
So I looked back into his law firm's cases

22:41.008 --> 22:42.159
for the past five years.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.804
Turns out Schuster represented Billy Piper.

22:44.839 --> 22:45.879
You guys remember the story, right?

22:45.914 --> 22:48.000
Yeah, it was all over the news for months.

22:48.035 --> 22:50.085
Famous pro golfer getting a divorce

22:50.120 --> 22:51.448
takes a boating trip to the Caribbean

22:51.483 --> 22:52.741
to work on his marriage...

22:52.776 --> 22:54.437
Only his wife never makes it back to shore.

22:54.447 --> 22:56.312
Billy claimed that the two of them were drinking,

22:56.347 --> 22:58.388
and his wife accidentally fell off of the boat.

22:58.423 --> 23:00.393
Everyone assumed it was murder.

23:00.428 --> 23:01.879
But the feds never had enough to indict him.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.304
Indeed.

23:03.339 --> 23:05.960
So what does any of this have to do with our victim?

23:05.995 --> 23:07.316
Three years ago,

23:07.351 --> 23:09.991
Michelle had a client who disappeared from her boat.

23:10.026 --> 23:11.857
That client...

23:11.892 --> 23:13.322
was Leann Piper.

23:13.357 --> 23:14.710
Billy Piper's wife?

23:14.745 --> 23:16.063
That can't be a coincidence.

23:16.073 --> 23:17.273
I don't think it was.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.438
In fact, I found a file...

23:18.473 --> 23:19.589
on Michelle's computer that showed that

23:19.624 --> 23:22.635
she'd been looking into Leann Piper's murder
for the past month.

23:22.670 --> 23:23.209
Wait a minute.

23:23.244 --> 23:25.795
What if Michelle figured out how Billy killed his wife?

23:25.830 --> 23:27.243
You mean by finding actual evidence?

23:27.278 --> 23:28.621
Right. Then the only way...

23:28.656 --> 23:30.486
Billy could stop that proof from coming out...

23:30.521 --> 23:32.408
Was to have Michelle killed.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.651
That's my pride and joy.

23:43.931 --> 23:45.396
Won it in Augusta in '02.

23:45.431 --> 23:46.862
You eagled for the win.

23:46.897 --> 23:47.807
That's right.

23:47.842 --> 23:49.767
Can I get either of you two a drink?

23:49.802 --> 23:51.773
This isn't a social visit, Mr. Piper.

23:51.808 --> 23:53.834
We're here to talk to you about Michelle Twohey.

23:53.869 --> 23:55.514
Michelle who-ey?

23:56.585 --> 23:58.640
Sorry. It doesn't sound familiar.

23:58.675 --> 24:02.076
It's odd that you don't remember
your late wife's divorce lawyer.

24:02.110 --> 24:04.024
Did you know that she'd turned up dead?

24:04.059 --> 24:05.758
The reason I'm asking is because she visited you

24:05.793 --> 24:07.422
about a month ago.

24:07.457 --> 24:10.128
Hmm. Don't recall any visits.

24:10.163 --> 24:11.234
You sure about that?

24:11.269 --> 24:14.380
It was right after that visit you hired Noah Kesswood.

24:14.490 --> 24:15.505
Who's Noah Kesswood?

24:15.540 --> 24:18.150
The man that you paid to spy on her.

24:18.185 --> 24:19.436
And then she winds up dead.

24:19.471 --> 24:21.712
That's awfully suspicious, don't you think?

24:21.747 --> 24:23.354
You people.

24:23.389 --> 24:24.927
Somebody dies,

24:24.962 --> 24:26.348
question Billy.

24:26.383 --> 24:27.698
Well, can you blame us,

24:27.733 --> 24:30.073
especially after what happened with your wife?

24:30.364 --> 24:31.549
Okay.

24:31.584 --> 24:34.360
Let's talk about what happened to my wife.

24:34.395 --> 24:36.881
Leann files for divorce so I fight her on it,

24:36.916 --> 24:39.817
because where I'm from, marriage is sacred.

24:40.406 --> 24:42.667
So Leann and I decide to go for a boat ride,

24:42.702 --> 24:44.483
like the old days,

24:44.518 --> 24:46.839
but instead of recapturing our magic,

24:46.874 --> 24:49.036
Leann got drunk and fell into the ocean.

24:49.071 --> 24:51.200
So why am I the bad guy?

24:51.235 --> 24:53.217
Oh, so you're the victim here?

24:53.252 --> 24:55.165
You bet your ass, I am.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.407
I lost my endorsements and my status.

24:57.442 --> 24:59.612
My own family wants nothing to do with me.

24:59.647 --> 25:00.297
Interesting.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.918
On the list of things you lost,

25:01.953 --> 25:03.503
you didn't include your wife.

25:06.454 --> 25:09.285
She never was my favorite trophy.

25:12.516 --> 25:15.207
Now why don't you two get the hell out of my home?

25:18.727 --> 25:20.043
Well, Billy did it.

25:20.078 --> 25:22.184
He killed his wife to keep his money,

25:22.219 --> 25:24.649
Then had Michelle murdered
when she found evidence of it.

25:24.684 --> 25:25.984
Only how do we prove it?

25:26.019 --> 25:27.500
Well, all roads lead to Noah.

25:27.535 --> 25:28.650
So if we can catch him,

25:28.660 --> 25:29.921
we'll get him to turn on Billy.

25:29.956 --> 25:31.126
Perfect.

25:31.161 --> 25:33.321
Only we don't have any way of finding him.

25:33.356 --> 25:34.997
Actually, we do.

25:35.032 --> 25:36.502
Turns out the garage at Billy's building

25:36.537 --> 25:38.158
has an automated valet system.

25:38.193 --> 25:39.644
The manager was able to pull up the records

25:39.679 --> 25:40.705
of when Noah parked there,

25:40.740 --> 25:42.002
and we got his license number.

25:42.037 --> 25:43.229
The car belongs to a fleet of vehicles

25:43.264 --> 25:45.055
that's registered to a pharmaceutical company.

25:45.090 --> 25:46.410
Was Noah an employee there?

25:46.445 --> 25:48.225
No, he has no affiliation.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.583
All right. You guys keep digging.

25:49.618 --> 25:50.906
There's gotta be a connection somewhere.

25:51.186 --> 25:52.032
Hello.

25:52.067 --> 25:52.843
Hey.

25:52.878 --> 25:55.348
Uh, yeah, Meredith. Yeah, Castle's right here.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.469
I'm sorry. What?

25:58.139 --> 25:59.639
You want to talk to me?

26:00.180 --> 26:01.579
Uh, yeah.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.051
No.

26:06.981 --> 26:08.331
Okay.

26:09.372 --> 26:10.872
Fine.

26:12.943 --> 26:14.413
What did she want?

26:15.814 --> 26:17.684
She asked me to dinner tonight.

26:17.865 --> 26:19.079
Just the two of us.

26:19.114 --> 26:20.260
To dinner?

26:20.295 --> 26:22.230
And you said yes? How could you say yes?

26:22.265 --> 26:24.786
Same way you did when she asked to stay with you.

26:24.821 --> 26:26.136
Besides, Castle, if said no,

26:26.171 --> 26:28.157
that would've made me look insecure.

26:32.308 --> 26:33.783
Is this as bad as it seems?

26:33.818 --> 26:35.990
No. It's much worse. Much, much worse.

26:36.025 --> 26:36.934
No. Okay, hang on.

26:36.969 --> 26:38.660
Let's... take a step back from this,

26:38.695 --> 26:40.451
and let's just think about it.

26:42.741 --> 26:43.801
Just dinner.

26:43.836 --> 26:44.827
Just dinner between

26:44.862 --> 26:47.723
your ex-wife and your new girlfriend.

26:48.083 --> 26:49.773
That's deadly.

26:50.073 --> 26:52.354
Castle, you have two worlds.

26:52.389 --> 26:52.999
Two.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.750
Right now, they're both coming together.

26:54.785 --> 26:56.965
Uh-oh. What happens when worlds collide?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.061
Boom.

26:58.096 --> 26:59.221
Okay, guys.

26:59.256 --> 27:01.187
You are taking this a little too far.

27:01.536 --> 27:02.787
Castle.

27:03.748 --> 27:06.367
- Meredith knows things about you.
- So?

27:06.402 --> 27:08.089
- So?
- So?

27:08.699 --> 27:09.804
So is there anything Meredith knows

27:09.839 --> 27:11.629
that you don't want Beckett to know?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.531
- Boom.
- Two worlds colliding.

27:22.592 --> 27:24.878
Have I told you how lovely your penmanship is?

27:24.913 --> 27:27.474
The font is just so friendly.
I just look forward to seeing it.

27:27.509 --> 27:29.284
Castle, what is it?

27:29.934 --> 27:32.485
I just want to make sure you want to go to dinner

27:32.520 --> 27:33.030
with Meredith.

27:33.066 --> 27:34.816
Remember... she's a little crazy.

27:34.851 --> 27:36.567
And of course, dramatic. Ew.

27:36.602 --> 27:38.027
Miserable combination.

27:38.127 --> 27:39.802
What are you so worried about?

27:39.837 --> 27:42.118
I mean, it's just two people
that you've been intimate with

27:42.153 --> 27:44.079
coming together, comparing notes.

27:44.114 --> 27:46.129
Comparing notes.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.820
What notes?

27:50.550 --> 27:52.656
Seriously, though. What notes?

27:52.691 --> 27:54.761
Hey, Espo. What do you got on Noah?

27:54.921 --> 27:55.432
Thanks.

27:55.662 --> 27:57.142
I just got off with the vice president

27:57.177 --> 27:58.548
from that pharmaceutical company.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.344
Guess where he went to college? University of New York.

28:01.379 --> 28:02.574
Sorry about that.

28:02.864 --> 28:05.164
Not only was he giving Noah access to that company car,

28:05.199 --> 28:06.297
but he's also been letting him

28:06.332 --> 28:07.395
stay with him for the past month.

28:07.430 --> 28:08.686
Okay, pick him up.

28:11.076 --> 28:12.326
Boom.

28:17.578 --> 28:18.718
There he is.

28:19.748 --> 28:21.910
Noah Kesswood. NYPD. Come here.

28:42.875 --> 28:44.346
That hurt as much as it looked?

28:45.886 --> 28:46.716
Good.

28:46.947 --> 28:48.447
And now you're under arrest.

28:55.229 --> 28:56.578
Look at him.

28:56.638 --> 28:58.063
Nothing like the devastated boyfriend

28:58.098 --> 28:59.607
that I met yesterday.

29:00.828 --> 29:01.757
Noah.

29:03.077 --> 29:04.325
You're good, man.

29:05.146 --> 29:06.230
But you're not that good.

29:06.265 --> 29:07.730
All right, let's not waste any time.

29:07.765 --> 29:10.214
We know that Billy hired you to spy on Michelle

29:10.249 --> 29:12.663
to see if she had any proof that he killed his wife.

29:12.698 --> 29:14.272
And when you discovered she did,

29:14.307 --> 29:15.877
on Billy's orders,

29:15.912 --> 29:17.421
you put an ice pick through her neck.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.621
I didn't kill Michelle.

29:18.656 --> 29:19.728
I don't believe you.

29:19.763 --> 29:20.766
You don't have to.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.226
See, while Michelle was being shish kebabed,

29:22.260 --> 29:24.394
I was all the way up at the university of New York,

29:24.429 --> 29:26.799
watching my alma mater play West Virginia.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.907
We won, by the way.

29:28.942 --> 29:30.443
Go, Broncos.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.752
If you didn't kill her,

29:31.787 --> 29:33.537
why'd you work so hard to disappear?

29:36.765 --> 29:38.496
Hey, detective...

29:39.044 --> 29:40.794
What do you say you buy me a soda, hmm?

29:40.829 --> 29:41.930
Excuse me?

29:41.965 --> 29:43.034
Not you.

29:44.072 --> 29:45.392
You.

29:47.362 --> 29:49.411
All right, look, I deal in intelligence,

29:49.446 --> 29:51.171
not murder, never murder.

29:51.231 --> 29:52.215
You want the truth?

29:52.250 --> 29:54.169
Okay, here it is free of charge.

29:54.204 --> 29:56.783
Billy Piper's absolutely paranoid.

29:56.818 --> 29:58.348
So when Michelle came around asking questions

29:58.383 --> 29:59.483
about that night on the boat,

29:59.518 --> 30:01.373
he went into full-on panic mode.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.221
Figured she probably had a vendetta against him,

30:03.256 --> 30:05.106
wanted him in jail for murdering her client.

30:05.141 --> 30:07.172
Reality is, he was probably right.

30:07.207 --> 30:09.169
She said she was close, very close,

30:09.204 --> 30:11.095
to finding out what really happened on that boat.

30:11.130 --> 30:13.200
- Are we talking actual evidence?
- Maybe.

30:13.235 --> 30:15.238
She was gathering the final puzzle pieces

30:15.273 --> 30:16.802
at the New York office of the D.E.A.

30:16.837 --> 30:18.679
The drug enforcement agency, why?

30:18.714 --> 30:20.521
You'd have to ask them, detective.

30:21.271 --> 30:23.560
Okay. Well, I'm still gonna have to hold you, you know?

30:23.595 --> 30:25.259
For up to 24 hours.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.798
And then you'll never see me again.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.228
All right. Thanks, Bill.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.317
Well, Noah's alibi is solid.

30:31.352 --> 30:32.882
He's definitely not the killer.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.251
But do we believe his story about the D.E.A.?

30:35.286 --> 30:37.135
I mean, what does any of this have to do with drugs?

30:37.170 --> 30:38.986
Well, there's only one way to find out.

30:39.021 --> 30:40.270
Ryan, see if you can uncover

30:40.305 --> 30:42.573
what Michelle was doing at the D.E.A.

30:42.608 --> 30:43.439
I'll try, but it's late.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.108
Probably won't hear anything till the morning.

30:45.143 --> 30:47.752
Well, I guess we should call it a night.

30:48.022 --> 30:49.556
Okay, Castle. See you later.

30:49.591 --> 30:51.056
Later? We can go back to my place together.

30:51.091 --> 30:54.949
Um, I have a dinner date with your ex-wife, remember?

30:54.984 --> 30:56.004
Yeah. I remember.

30:56.039 --> 30:57.758
I was just hoping you'd forget.

30:57.793 --> 30:59.338
Okay. Don't wait up.

31:01.718 --> 31:02.527
I...

31:06.656 --> 31:08.890
Oh, darling, please. Just relax.

31:08.925 --> 31:11.089
I can't relax, mother.

31:11.124 --> 31:13.703
My... my worlds are colliding, okay?

31:13.738 --> 31:15.888
I'm not... I can't relax.

31:15.923 --> 31:18.392
Well, have a glass of wine. Works for me.

31:19.332 --> 31:20.596
I bet there out there right now,

31:20.631 --> 31:21.861
just telling secrets about me.

31:21.896 --> 31:23.845
Boom. What do I do?

31:23.880 --> 31:25.129
Should I call them? I should call them.

31:25.164 --> 31:26.879
No, no, no.

31:27.258 --> 31:28.224
What you shouldn't have done

31:28.259 --> 31:30.938
was let Meredith stay here in the first place.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.252
This isn't a flophouse, darling.

31:32.287 --> 31:36.076
You've got to stop letting freeloaders just live here.

31:36.297 --> 31:38.405
Please tell me you see the irony.

31:39.326 --> 31:41.385
My god, Meredith. Castle did that?

31:41.544 --> 31:43.473
I can't believe that you married him.

31:43.508 --> 31:44.684
What can't you believe?

31:44.719 --> 31:45.715
What? No. What?

31:45.750 --> 31:46.678
No. Come on.

31:46.713 --> 31:48.797
Beckett, there's two sides to that story.

31:48.832 --> 31:50.881
That... what did you...
what story... what did you tell her?

31:50.916 --> 31:52.086
The truth, Richard.

31:52.121 --> 31:54.451
Castle, you're not the man that I thought I knew.

31:54.486 --> 31:55.805
I'm the man you thought you knew.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.430
I'm the man you know. I thought you...

31:57.464 --> 31:58.909
I'm that... you think... I know you.

31:58.944 --> 31:59.708
I'm him.

32:01.948 --> 32:03.002
This is so not cool.

32:03.037 --> 32:04.807
Oh, you're right. He does lean to the left.

32:04.842 --> 32:06.576
Told ya. Only when he's stressed.

32:06.611 --> 32:08.035
I've never even noticed that before.

32:08.070 --> 32:09.520
What? D... what leans?

32:09.555 --> 32:11.645
Thank you, Meredith. That was so fun.

32:11.680 --> 32:12.788
Mm. Thanks for coming.

32:12.823 --> 32:14.684
You have a great night. Good night, Martha.

32:14.719 --> 32:16.193
Good night, darling.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.971
Okay. What did she say about me?

32:25.969 --> 32:28.204
Oh, come on. I get it. I get it.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.707
I mishandled this whole thing, and I am sorry.

32:30.742 --> 32:33.362
Believe me, I am sorry.

32:33.397 --> 32:36.987
Please tell me what Meredith said.

32:37.386 --> 32:39.736
Is it anything I need to be worried about?

32:40.445 --> 32:41.190
You know what, Castle?

32:41.225 --> 32:43.584
As much as fun as it would be
to continue torturing you,

32:43.619 --> 32:46.113
I actually like you a little bit more now.

32:46.148 --> 32:47.088
You do?

32:47.123 --> 32:48.747
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Meredith is a fun,

32:48.782 --> 32:51.782
dynamic, and hard-to-say-no-to woman.

32:51.817 --> 32:52.586
But...

32:52.621 --> 32:55.270
as long as we're together, she never stays here again.

32:55.305 --> 32:56.420
That goes without saying.

32:56.455 --> 32:57.380
Okay.

32:59.449 --> 33:01.888
Mm. Let it go to voice mail.

33:01.923 --> 33:03.207
Okay. Mm.

33:04.647 --> 33:05.876
Oh, it's the precinct.

33:05.911 --> 33:07.071
- What?
- Beckett.

33:07.106 --> 33:09.015
Hey, I just got off with the D.E.A.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.287
You need to get down here right now.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.525
Yeah, okay. We'll be right there.

33:15.853 --> 33:17.198
Michelle was very interested

33:17.233 --> 33:19.872
in the D.E.A.'s caribbean drug interdiction efforts,

33:19.907 --> 33:22.031
which involve the tracking of planes and boats

33:22.066 --> 33:23.495
using satellite photos.

33:23.530 --> 33:25.671
She obtained this 3-year-old satellite photo

33:25.706 --> 33:27.350
from the night of Leann Piper's murder.

33:27.385 --> 33:28.689
Take a look.

33:29.688 --> 33:30.694
There's two boats.

33:30.729 --> 33:32.704
Yeah, less than 50 feet apart.

33:32.739 --> 33:34.677
And they identified that one as Billy Piper's.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.082
That's how he got away with it.

33:36.117 --> 33:37.821
That's why Leann was never found.

33:37.856 --> 33:40.166
Billy was afraid that her body would wash up,

33:40.201 --> 33:42.440
So he enlisted an accomplice to take the remains

33:42.475 --> 33:44.114
and dump them where nobody would ever look.

33:44.149 --> 33:45.789
If Michelle got on to this,

33:45.824 --> 33:47.688
that accomplice might be the person who murdered her.

33:47.723 --> 33:49.612
Yeah, but how did she know to look for another boat?

33:49.647 --> 33:50.937
It was recently listed as an asset

33:50.971 --> 33:52.007
in one of her divorce cases.

33:52.042 --> 33:55.611
And, guys, you're never gonna guess
who the accomplice is.

33:56.139 --> 33:57.325
Hello, Walter.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.475
Can I help you?

33:58.510 --> 34:00.959
Yeah, we're here to see a man about a boat.

34:06.816 --> 34:09.764
Why would I kill my ex-wife's divorce lawyer?

34:09.800 --> 34:11.597
She did a terrible job.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.393
And because of that, I won.

34:13.873 --> 34:16.493
Do you want to know why you won?

34:16.743 --> 34:19.766
Because Michelle was spending all of her time

34:19.802 --> 34:22.780
sifting through your financials from three years ago.

34:22.815 --> 34:25.440
She became very interested in how your family

34:25.475 --> 34:27.344
and Billy Piper's family

34:27.380 --> 34:29.478
were all members of the same yacht club.

34:29.514 --> 34:30.447
So?

34:30.487 --> 34:32.867
You and Billy Piper were friends.

34:33.297 --> 34:35.577
Again, I respond, so?

34:35.612 --> 34:36.726
So...

34:36.976 --> 34:40.429
Michelle found proof that you refueled your boat

34:40.465 --> 34:43.389
near the waters where billy's wife was killed.

34:43.424 --> 34:46.277
She tracked your boat using satellite photos.

34:46.313 --> 34:50.512
This is Billy Piper's boat,
where his wife was last seen.

34:50.545 --> 34:52.451
And whose boat is this over here?

34:52.485 --> 34:54.054
Oh, it's yours.

34:54.090 --> 34:56.830
The D.E.A. identified it as your boat.

34:56.864 --> 34:58.184
You were Billy's accomplice.

34:58.219 --> 34:59.654
The two of you had a pretty good plan,

34:59.689 --> 35:01.619
except for there was one thing you couldn't foresee.

35:01.654 --> 35:03.345
That your wife would hire Michelle

35:03.380 --> 35:05.114
to represent her in your divorce.

35:05.149 --> 35:06.812
Michelle was probably looking for proof of an affair.

35:06.847 --> 35:08.735
Except she found something much worse.

35:08.770 --> 35:11.115
That little boat trip you took to the caribbean?

35:11.150 --> 35:12.500
As she looked closer

35:12.535 --> 35:14.704
at who you were with and why you were there,

35:14.739 --> 35:16.664
she discovered the truth.

35:19.082 --> 35:20.982
I want to talk to my lawyer.

35:22.402 --> 35:24.416
Without a confession, our case is purely speculative.

35:24.451 --> 35:26.430
Well, we could dig into Walter's life,

35:26.465 --> 35:27.465
Maybe find some proof.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.119
And some motive, too, if we're lucky.

35:29.154 --> 35:30.374
Okay, so it's not just me?

35:30.409 --> 35:31.903
Walter has no real motive, does he?

35:31.938 --> 35:34.777
No. I mean, why would walter help Billy kill his wife?

35:34.812 --> 35:38.051
Yeah, sure, they're friends,
but what was in it for Walter?

35:38.086 --> 35:40.186
Well, it's not like they agreed to kill
each others' wives,

35:40.221 --> 35:41.309
like "Strangers on a Train."

35:41.344 --> 35:44.475
Though what we saw of... Walter's relationship,

35:44.510 --> 35:45.494
I'm sure he thought about it.

35:45.529 --> 35:46.498
Hey, guys.

35:46.533 --> 35:48.203
I found something in Walter's phone records,

35:48.238 --> 35:49.582
and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

35:49.617 --> 35:51.136
On the morning of Michelle's murder,

35:51.171 --> 35:53.512
Walter made a 20-minute phone call to
the Garrison residence.

35:53.546 --> 35:54.656
Garrison... the accountant

35:54.691 --> 35:56.099
that michelle was so desperate to meet?

35:56.135 --> 35:57.910
Why would Walter call him?

35:57.950 --> 35:59.059
Who's this?

35:59.619 --> 36:00.935
The woman of my dreams.

36:00.969 --> 36:02.778
She's married to that accountant.

36:03.868 --> 36:05.688
Guys, look at Billy's...

36:05.723 --> 36:07.037
dead wife.

36:07.257 --> 36:10.406
And now look at the accountant's wife.

36:11.605 --> 36:14.444
Different hair, different nose, different chin, but...

36:14.479 --> 36:15.876
They're the same woman.

36:15.911 --> 36:17.239
That's why they never found a body,

36:17.274 --> 36:19.612
Because Billy's dead wife Leann...

36:19.893 --> 36:21.362
is alive.

36:21.532 --> 36:23.277
Again, thank you, Mrs. Garrison

36:23.312 --> 36:25.575
for coming down here at such a late hour.

36:25.611 --> 36:28.561
Didn't my husband answer all
the other detectives' questions?

36:28.596 --> 36:30.929
Oh, he did, but there was just one...

36:31.159 --> 36:32.888
that only you can answer.

36:33.169 --> 36:34.628
Who's this woman?

36:35.208 --> 36:37.447
Oh, here. Let me get that for you.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.306
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

36:44.004 --> 36:46.104
Sorry. I don't recognize her.

36:46.139 --> 36:47.981
You sure about that?

36:48.016 --> 36:49.823
Because, you know,

36:50.023 --> 36:53.117
you can change your name, you can change your looks,

36:53.152 --> 36:56.211
but there is one thing that you cannot change...

36:56.246 --> 36:57.230
Your...

36:58.890 --> 37:00.459
fingerprints.

37:03.119 --> 37:05.037
We know who you are.

37:05.187 --> 37:06.173
Hello, Leann.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.997
Welcome back from the dead.

37:08.787 --> 37:10.351
I think you must have the wrong person.

37:10.386 --> 37:12.745
You can drop the charade, Leann.

37:13.095 --> 37:14.615
We spoke with your current husband.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.135
He said that you drove into the city

37:16.170 --> 37:17.489
the night that Michelle was killed,

37:17.524 --> 37:20.143
and he also identified the murder weapon

37:20.178 --> 37:22.274
as a mahogany-handled ice pick

37:22.309 --> 37:24.454
missing from your kitchen.

37:24.489 --> 37:26.601
You know, it's funny, for a minute there,

37:26.641 --> 37:28.560
We thought Walter was helping Billy.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.735
But actually, he was helping you.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.439
The only thing that we couldn't figure out was why?

37:33.474 --> 37:35.908
Why did you go through all of this?

37:42.815 --> 37:45.525
Because everybody loved Billy.

37:46.094 --> 37:48.374
You try being married to him.

37:48.544 --> 37:51.983
He was a hero in public and a monster at home.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.972
When I finally got the courage to divorce him,

37:54.006 --> 37:55.612
you know how the media portrayed me?

37:55.646 --> 37:57.977
As just another gold digging trophy wife,

37:58.012 --> 38:00.310
looking for her half.

38:00.589 --> 38:02.919
He destroyed my reputation.

38:03.209 --> 38:04.263
He was gonna destroy me.

38:04.298 --> 38:07.527
The only way I could get my life back was to die.

38:07.562 --> 38:08.969
But you needed help.

38:09.004 --> 38:10.377
And Walter needed the money.

38:11.116 --> 38:12.885
At least he did at the time.

38:14.495 --> 38:16.435
So we devised a plan.

38:18.204 --> 38:20.203
I convinced Billy to take the trip,

38:20.923 --> 38:22.547
and then when the scotch put him to sleep...

38:22.582 --> 38:24.137
You escaped on to Walter's boat,

38:24.172 --> 38:26.692
turning your husband into a wife killer.

38:27.420 --> 38:29.110
It's what he deserved.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.569
And I got to start over.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.288
I was supposed to leave the country,

38:36.323 --> 38:38.347
but I met Rob, and...

38:39.497 --> 38:41.166
I fell for him.

38:42.336 --> 38:43.965
We were so happy.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.849
Until Michelle put the pieces together.

38:46.884 --> 38:49.504
She said she couldn't live with the injustice.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.323
I mean, can you believe that, from a lawyer?

38:53.022 --> 38:55.052
She sided with Billy.

38:55.481 --> 38:57.361
I mean, she knew what he was like.

38:57.397 --> 38:59.206
She knew what he did to me.

38:59.241 --> 39:01.659
Why couldn't she just leave it alone?

39:01.694 --> 39:02.430
Stand up.

39:03.148 --> 39:05.358
Let's go. Come on. Stand up.

39:07.208 --> 39:08.202
Turn around.

39:08.237 --> 39:09.162
Hands behind your back.

39:09.198 --> 39:11.016
Leann Piper, you are under arrest

39:11.051 --> 39:12.835
for the murder of Michelle Twohey.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.163
I mean, I know your apartment is habitable again,

39:21.198 --> 39:23.327
I just... do you have to leave?

39:23.362 --> 39:25.771
Do you want me here because you actually want me here

39:25.806 --> 39:28.180
or do you need protection from the redheads?

39:28.921 --> 39:29.961
A little of both.

39:29.996 --> 39:30.964
Okay, I'll tell you what.

39:30.999 --> 39:33.154
If it gets to be too much,

39:33.189 --> 39:35.309
You can come and stay... at my place.

39:35.344 --> 39:36.418
Thank you.

39:36.888 --> 39:39.227
Are you sure it's okay that I'm going to Paris

39:39.262 --> 39:39.892
without you?

39:39.927 --> 39:41.807
Just because I'm sick, you shouldn't miss it.

39:41.842 --> 39:43.213
I want you to go.

39:43.248 --> 39:44.586
We all do.

39:45.545 --> 39:46.400
What's going on?

39:46.435 --> 39:47.680
I just feel so guilty

39:47.715 --> 39:50.763
that mom is missing her vacation because I'm sick,

39:50.798 --> 39:53.812
so I told her to enjoy Paris for the both of us.

39:54.062 --> 39:56.231
Oh, are you sure, Alexis? I mean, your mother...

39:57.571 --> 39:58.750
Should...

39:59.030 --> 40:00.555
Enjoy her vacation.

40:00.590 --> 40:02.079
Have a safe trip, Meredith.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.064
Je t'aime, maman.

40:04.099 --> 40:05.998
Moi aussi. Je t'aime.

40:07.908 --> 40:09.668
Adios, dear. Have fun.

40:09.703 --> 40:11.117
Martha.

40:11.557 --> 40:14.311
Well, this has been... oh, shoot.

40:14.346 --> 40:16.634
I left my purse upstairs. Be a dear.

40:16.669 --> 40:17.655
I'll grab it.

40:20.044 --> 40:23.293
Detective Beckett, it was a real pleasure.

40:23.328 --> 40:25.557
Yes, it really was.

40:25.592 --> 40:26.816
You know, Meredith, it's so funny.

40:26.851 --> 40:29.511
When you first came and insisted on staying here,

40:29.546 --> 40:32.170
I was afraid that you might have had a secret agenda.

40:32.205 --> 40:33.919
Actually, I did.

40:34.519 --> 40:35.799
When Alexis told me about you two

40:35.834 --> 40:37.603
and how this one was serious,

40:37.639 --> 40:39.667
I knew I had to check it out for myself.

40:39.702 --> 40:41.696
And I'm so glad I did.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.896
You two are great together.

40:44.136 --> 40:45.216
Thank you.

40:46.374 --> 40:48.075
Can I ask you a question?

40:48.734 --> 40:51.443
Why didn't it work out between you and Rick?

40:52.683 --> 40:53.418
I'm sorry.

40:53.453 --> 40:54.118
Is that too personal?

40:54.153 --> 40:56.316
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine.

40:56.351 --> 41:00.351
You know, being married to Richard was great...

41:00.386 --> 41:02.506
Full of romance and excitement,

41:02.541 --> 41:04.594
Like a deliciously sweet souffle.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.678
And then one day,
I realized, he knew everything about me...

41:07.713 --> 41:10.308
My deepest secrets, my worst pain...

41:10.343 --> 41:12.253
Enough to fill a million novels.

41:12.288 --> 41:14.165
But I didn't know enough about him

41:14.200 --> 41:16.316
to even write a pamphlet.

41:17.264 --> 41:19.134
I don't understand.

41:19.464 --> 41:21.279
For instance, whenever I asked him about

41:21.314 --> 41:23.464
how he felt about never knowing his father,

41:23.499 --> 41:24.604
He would smirk.

41:24.639 --> 41:25.677
You know the way he smirks.

41:25.712 --> 41:27.671
And then he would throw out a quip

41:27.706 --> 41:29.145
and change the subject.

41:29.180 --> 41:32.220
Our marriage went one way,
and that wasn't enough for me.

41:32.410 --> 41:33.470
I mean...

41:33.660 --> 41:35.145
Souffles are wonderful,

41:35.179 --> 41:37.878
but sooner or later, they always fall.

41:39.888 --> 41:42.897
Oh, but that was a long, long time ago.

41:42.932 --> 41:44.963
Wh-what? 15 years in fact.

41:44.997 --> 41:46.995
He's a totally different man now.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.640
Yes, of course.

41:48.675 --> 41:50.334
I was just curious.

41:50.369 --> 41:52.283
Okay. Here we go.

41:53.453 --> 41:56.203
Oh, you are the best, Rick. Thank you.

41:56.238 --> 41:56.811
You bet.

41:57.742 --> 41:59.716
I hope we see each other again.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.210
Oh, me, too, Meredith.
Have a wonderful trip.

42:02.400 --> 42:02.870
Good-bye, Rick.

42:03.019 --> 42:04.010
Bye.

42:08.848 --> 42:12.007
How about I make you a little breakfast
before you leave?

42:12.267 --> 42:14.077
I'm gonna whip you up a smor-let.

42:14.112 --> 42:15.886
It sounds better than it tastes.

42:16.096 --> 42:20.254
Wait, that's... no.
It's the other way around.
