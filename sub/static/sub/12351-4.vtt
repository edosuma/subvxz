WEBVTT

00:00.085 --> 00:01.459
Previously on Greek:

00:01.631 --> 00:04.189
We'll see what we can do to
get your o-chem grades back up.

00:04.380 --> 00:06.374
Even if I get "a's" in
my other honors classes,

00:06.499 --> 00:08.506
i'm still gonna drop
below the required 3.5 cum.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.415
My "d" is officially a "c".

00:10.595 --> 00:12.595
- Wait, that's it?
- It's good enough for now.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.225
You're a good kisser.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.008
What are we doing?

00:17.133 --> 00:19.560
I didn't kiss evan at the
end of the world party. I kissed fisher.

00:19.809 --> 00:20.561
What?

00:20.861 --> 00:23.337
I was drunk.
And I screwed up big time.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.316
When someone cheats on me,
it's over.

00:26.501 --> 00:28.706
Grant and I kissed. If
anyone from the house saw him,

00:28.831 --> 00:30.856
he's screwed, 'cause he
didn't want to come out yet.

00:30.981 --> 00:33.449
We, at pan-hellenic, are
deducting blue ribbon points

00:33.574 --> 00:36.873
from sorities whose sisters choose
to participate in the undie run.

00:37.168 --> 00:41.117
But it's a 60-year-old tradition
that fosters school spirit and unity.

00:41.384 --> 00:42.921
Moving on...

00:43.046 --> 00:44.626
Nice work saving the undie run.

00:44.846 --> 00:46.652
Some people didn't think so.

00:49.589 --> 00:53.010
So pan-hellenic scholarship applications
are due at the end of the month.

00:53.358 --> 00:54.656
Moving on...

00:54.781 --> 00:58.236
Tomorrow we start our
annual dry weekend, a chance for cru's

00:58.361 --> 01:02.220
greek system to prove it can
actually go 48 hours without alcohol.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.978
This is always so lame.

01:04.236 --> 01:05.334
Excuse me?

01:05.459 --> 01:07.272
Is she looking at me?

01:07.940 --> 01:09.983
I understand it
might be difficult to

01:10.108 --> 01:12.154
muster the enthusiasm for
this event you had

01:12.279 --> 01:15.516
for running around in your underwear,
but do you have a comment, zbz?

01:16.220 --> 01:18.036
I just said

01:18.719 --> 01:21.872
I think... dry weekend
is a little ineffective.

01:22.041 --> 01:25.014
Houses can't have parties
with alcohol so we...

01:26.151 --> 01:28.742
They end up at a packed dobler's

01:28.867 --> 01:31.507
or drinking in some
smelly fraternity basement.

01:31.957 --> 01:34.986
That's not gonna happen. There
won't be underground partying.

01:35.111 --> 01:38.202
Ifc and pan-hellenic are doing
sober patrols of all the houses.

01:38.327 --> 01:40.014
And any house found in violation

01:40.200 --> 01:42.064
faces social suspension
for one month.

01:42.312 --> 01:44.395
Great, now it's gonna
be lame and alcohol free.

01:44.696 --> 01:47.265
I'm sorry, we're in a small room.
Why do you think I can't hear you?

01:50.450 --> 01:54.112
It just seems like all you're doing
is telling people what they can't do.

01:54.391 --> 01:56.745
If the whole point of dry
weekend is to show people

01:56.870 --> 02:00.385
they can have fun without alcohol, why
not give them something they can do?

02:00.510 --> 02:02.063
Something that's fun.

02:03.708 --> 02:04.641
Like?

02:06.083 --> 02:07.977
Me? OK.

02:09.502 --> 02:13.032
I guess we could do a
party, a progressive party.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.111
Where each sority has a
different sober activity.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.721
Like... A drunk-driving
simulator. Or root beer pong.

02:19.021 --> 02:21.724
And karaoke!
Everyone loves karaoke!

02:28.197 --> 02:31.150
Since you have such
a good take on it...

02:31.275 --> 02:33.502
... you're in charge of dry weekend.

02:33.990 --> 02:34.838
Me?

02:36.073 --> 02:37.647
Moving on...

02:41.151 --> 02:44.211
OK, so you combine
silicon tetrachloride,

02:44.336 --> 02:45.951
diphenylmercury and...

02:46.167 --> 02:47.716
Crap, what is it?

02:47.841 --> 02:49.424
What about absinthe?

02:49.549 --> 02:52.535
Absinthe isn't an
organometallic compound.

02:52.660 --> 02:55.217
But it could be the perfect cocktail
for this year's dry weekend.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.708
It's very hip right now.

02:56.833 --> 02:59.281
But dry weekend is supposed
to be alcohol-free, right?

02:59.406 --> 03:01.738
Technically, but for the
kappa taus' underground

03:02.016 --> 03:05.061
wet weekend party, i'm reading
about the "green fairy."

03:05.186 --> 03:07.305
Do you really think
it causes facial tics?

03:07.669 --> 03:09.204
Whatever.

03:10.095 --> 03:11.977
Why are you giving me this?

03:12.102 --> 03:14.037
It's yours. Your mails
still come to the house.

03:14.162 --> 03:17.245
- I moved out months ago!
- Yeah, there's a bunch of it.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.113
It's the anchor.

03:20.787 --> 03:23.016
Your nickname's Spitter
because you spit on a girl.

03:23.141 --> 03:26.123
- What does anchor even mean?
- Maybe it means "news anchor?"

03:26.601 --> 03:30.176
Because I'm always up on what's
going on in polymer science?

03:30.301 --> 03:32.503
Excuse me. You
called spitter "anchor."

03:32.865 --> 03:35.094
If I may, what is the derivation?

03:35.219 --> 03:38.172
It's because he got such a low
grade on his o-chem midterm,

03:38.297 --> 03:41.636
he's holding down the curve
like an anchor. Get it?

03:41.872 --> 03:43.203
Yeah, I get it.

03:45.582 --> 03:48.245
That's my first experience
with nerd-on-nerd hazing.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.274
I still prefer spitter.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.156
Yeah, me too.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.840
Kappa Tau Team

04:05.314 --> 04:06.704
you're here!

04:06.829 --> 04:09.009
I was just making our
escape plan from dry weekend.

04:09.134 --> 04:12.709
I have movies, pedicures and to honor
the occasion, an in-town bar crawl.

04:12.973 --> 04:15.952
The bar crawl is especially
important, because that is

04:16.077 --> 04:19.214
where i'm going to meet a new
boy who isn't fisher.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.971
I hate to burst your new boy bubble,

04:23.096 --> 04:25.568
but pan-hellenic's enforcing
dry weekend this year.

04:26.012 --> 04:29.722
Each sority has to host a sober
party tomorrow night, including zbz.

04:30.029 --> 04:31.623
What? Whose dumb idea was that?

04:31.748 --> 04:34.328
I don't know, just some girl...

04:35.692 --> 04:37.071
Are you done with that, ash?

04:37.931 --> 04:39.378
I am.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.033
He has been trying
to do that all day!

04:44.360 --> 04:47.212
- What? Make eye contact?
- Yes! And I can't avoid him.

04:47.337 --> 04:51.240
I don't want to see him, hear
him, or smell him ever again.

04:52.249 --> 04:54.623
He smells like cupcakes and man.

04:55.296 --> 04:58.706
Speaking of cupcakes and
man, since we're not going

04:58.831 --> 05:01.717
to have alcohol at the party,
we have to have killer food,

05:01.885 --> 05:04.959
which means we'll probably
need fisher to work tomorrow.

05:07.282 --> 05:09.780
Stupid dry weekend!

05:11.000 --> 05:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:19.495 --> 05:22.018
Knock knock! Can I come in?

05:22.143 --> 05:24.694
Fancy wrapping paper. Who's it for?

05:25.152 --> 05:27.284
It's for my roommate's birthday.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.111
Is he a girl?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.266
OK, what do you want?

05:31.391 --> 05:34.166
Can't I just come over to hang out
without having an ulterior motive?

05:35.074 --> 05:37.305
OK, you have to get
ashleigh to forgive me.

05:38.258 --> 05:40.922
I've apologized, groveled,
told her I liked those silly

05:41.047 --> 05:43.042
arm warmer things she wears.
Nothing's worked.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.929
You kissed her boyfriend.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.349
All right? And if you're
feeling a little bit guilty,

05:47.640 --> 05:49.180
then maybe you should be.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.933
Guilt! That's what it is.

05:53.133 --> 05:55.290
Sorry. Hi.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.121
- Is this grant's room?
- Yeah.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.144
Perfect, I'm here to
surprise him for his birthday!

06:01.269 --> 06:02.636
Have you seen him?

06:02.761 --> 06:04.145
Are you his sister?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.646
What are you doing here?

06:06.771 --> 06:08.210
Surprise!

06:15.026 --> 06:16.546
Close family.

06:27.097 --> 06:29.355
We having a garage
sale for the lord?

06:29.480 --> 06:31.885
No. No tithing today.

06:32.145 --> 06:35.058
Just, putting some of
these things in storage,

06:35.183 --> 06:37.500
until me and god
work some of our issues out.

06:38.274 --> 06:41.460
I don't really need nana's
crucifixion

06:41.585 --> 06:44.813
linens around.
Or my precious moments baby angels.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.561
They're so judgy.

06:47.686 --> 06:50.612
Have you heard anyone
call me "anchor?"

06:50.737 --> 06:52.864
I only said it twice.
It was behind your back.

06:52.989 --> 06:55.263
But that was it, OK? I swear.

06:55.613 --> 06:58.002
Not to god, of course.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.523
This is all because
of stupid o-chem.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.184
I've been busting my butt trying
to make up for this midterm

07:03.309 --> 07:05.381
and now I have to deal
with my reputation?

07:05.661 --> 07:07.380
What more can I do?

07:08.147 --> 07:10.582
Try being known for
something other than grades.

07:10.707 --> 07:13.168
Maybe do an outside project.
I'm thinking about doing one.

07:13.293 --> 07:14.716
That's a great idea.

07:14.841 --> 07:16.572
I've been tinkering
with eco-polymers.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.052
There you go. All you
need is a faculty sponsor.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.420
There's only one professor
I know well enough to ask.

07:22.051 --> 07:24.651
- What do you want, cartwright?
- A minute of your time?

07:25.017 --> 07:27.828
You have exactly one
before my weekend begins.

07:33.594 --> 07:37.532
Since I started here at cru, I've
had this intense desire to study...

07:37.657 --> 07:40.350
another book signing? They
expect me to spend my free time

07:40.475 --> 07:44.310
at some stupid party to kiss larsen's
ass because he wrote a book?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.326
I personally hate books.

07:47.886 --> 07:49.358
And people who write them.

07:49.483 --> 07:51.085
Makes sense, given your grades.

07:51.210 --> 07:53.175
Which was exactly why I was thinking

07:53.300 --> 07:56.391
you might consider
sponsoring this idea...

07:56.736 --> 07:58.327
I don't sponsor projects.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.848
I find them to be a waste
of my time and expertise.

08:01.107 --> 08:04.015
The thing is, I'm really
trying to make a name for myself

08:04.140 --> 08:06.431
- in this department.
- You mean, besides "anchor?"

08:06.556 --> 08:09.088
- You know about that?
- I believe I started it.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.138
And now, it's the weekend.

08:21.832 --> 08:23.438
Saw your girlfriend, grant.

08:24.352 --> 08:26.569
- She's smokin'!
- Yeah.

08:27.302 --> 08:30.091
Yeah, who wouldn't
want to tap that, right?

08:30.261 --> 08:32.163
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about whitney.

08:32.288 --> 08:34.197
She and I have been
dating since high school.

08:34.322 --> 08:36.043
I'm obviously gonna end things,

08:36.168 --> 08:38.041
but I really wanted
to do it in person.

08:38.166 --> 08:40.019
She's here now.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.419
Hey guys! I hope you don't mind.

08:42.544 --> 08:45.292
I put some stuff up in
your closet. It's huge.

08:45.543 --> 08:47.570
You could fit, like,
a person in there.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.198
You're staying here?

08:50.323 --> 08:53.049
Don't worry. Grant and I
won't do anything naughty...

08:53.526 --> 08:55.532
... until you're asleep.

09:02.479 --> 09:03.804
What's up?

09:04.649 --> 09:07.641
Jeez, if you vibe that guy
any harder, you might get pregnant.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.771
Tonight is my last chance
to meet a new hot guy

09:10.896 --> 09:14.302
before I'm trapped in the house
with my old hot guy. Sober.

09:21.063 --> 09:22.685
When did you two get so friendly?

09:22.926 --> 09:25.261
We're not friendly. We
just have the greeting down.

09:25.386 --> 09:28.339
Trust me, anything longer than an
elevator ride would be totally awkward.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.940
- To dry weekend!
- Cheers to you...

09:32.333 --> 09:34.577
And to weekends... Dry ones.

09:35.457 --> 09:36.825
Awkward like that?

09:37.184 --> 09:40.299
I hope you guys aren't
planning any stealth parties.

09:40.551 --> 09:42.866
Pan-hellenic and ifc
are patrolling this year.

09:42.991 --> 09:46.187
Not to worry. My brothers and
I are amazing at hiding liquor.

09:46.312 --> 09:48.921
Like right now, I may or may not
have a vodka bottle down my pants.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.464
I'm sure I can handle
whoever they send over.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.036
They're sending me.

09:53.161 --> 09:56.647
- What? You have to patrol?
- Nice! A cop on the inside...

09:56.772 --> 09:59.681
who knows all your best hiding places.
Under the stairs,

10:00.042 --> 10:02.598
the tool shed, and that secret closet
off your room where we...

10:02.723 --> 10:04.120
... talked.

10:05.048 --> 10:07.494
Thanks for the warning. Adios.

10:08.678 --> 10:10.501
I can't believe you're ditching me.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.792
I'm pretending you're the lemon.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.953
Bitter's not pretty, ash.

10:17.385 --> 10:18.529
Who's that?

10:18.654 --> 10:20.376
It's katherine.
She was gonna text me

10:20.501 --> 10:22.627
- who I'm patrolling with from ifc.
- Is it a cute boy?

10:22.752 --> 10:25.256
And does he have any
non-cheater friends for me?

10:25.676 --> 10:27.399
It's a boy all right.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.736
- That looks really great, you guys.
- Thanks.

10:41.554 --> 10:43.566
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

10:45.482 --> 10:47.422
It is pretty impressive
that you were able

10:47.547 --> 10:49.639
to put this all together
on such short notice, zbz.

10:49.764 --> 10:52.602
- What can I say? I'm awesome.
- And humble.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.239
There's just one little hiccup.

10:57.931 --> 11:01.076
Which is kinda funny,
because it's dry weekend.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.695
Anyway, I was wondering
if there was someone else

11:06.820 --> 11:10.106
I could patrol with tonight.
I'd prefer not to go with evan chambers.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.595
Because you guys used to date?

11:12.844 --> 11:14.589
And it didn't end well.

11:14.918 --> 11:16.674
Bribes, power and...

11:16.861 --> 11:20.009
My point is, it might
be a little awkward.

11:20.134 --> 11:21.753
I know, right?

11:21.878 --> 11:23.770
What is this, eighth grade?
Way to be powerful.

11:23.895 --> 11:27.256
I was thinking, with all your
good ideas on dry weekend,

11:27.381 --> 11:30.187
you might even be
pan-hellenic board material.

11:30.396 --> 11:32.039
There's a spot on the board?

11:32.164 --> 11:34.374
Janette dropped out to focus
on school, imagine that.

11:34.499 --> 11:36.514
If you can't even handle
something as

11:36.639 --> 11:38.440
simple as riding in
a golf cart with an ex,

11:38.565 --> 11:41.408
I think I'm gonna have to find
someone who can. Moving on...

11:41.625 --> 11:44.288
No, don't move on! I can handle it.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.578
I can totally handle it.

11:47.842 --> 11:50.058
Yes? Yes! Good.

11:52.099 --> 11:53.894
Yeah, I can.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.690
I know, beav.
It's hard to understand.

11:57.815 --> 11:59.823
The greek council could've
at least had the decency

11:59.948 --> 12:01.935
to give us a heads up,
so maybe I could

12:02.060 --> 12:03.976
get a nice buzz on before
the patrols started.

12:04.101 --> 12:06.641
That's weird. My nana usually
sends me money for my birthday.

12:07.905 --> 12:10.287
- Times are tough.
- She must not love you anymore.

12:10.412 --> 12:12.903
Regardless, we can't afford
being on social suspension again.

12:13.028 --> 12:16.901
So this weekend, the kappa tau house
will be closed for business.

12:17.071 --> 12:18.820
One weekend sober, big deal.

12:19.165 --> 12:22.280
The rest of my college career known as
"the anchor," bigger deal.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.688
- But you're spitter.
- I've already logged a complaint.

12:24.813 --> 12:27.738
- You're just gonna throw in the towel?
- What else can I do?

12:27.863 --> 12:30.416
Hastings is the only professor
I have a relationship with.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.826
As with all relationships,
spitter, it's a numbers game.

12:33.951 --> 12:36.493
Wade, how many girls
smacked you last weekend

12:36.618 --> 12:38.186
before one would go home with you?

12:38.311 --> 12:40.357
My cheek went numb
after the first dozen,

12:40.482 --> 12:42.885
but then I found a transfer
who didn't know better.

12:43.136 --> 12:46.395
See? Just find a high concentration
of professors to hit on.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.336
Sure, you might get
slapped by 99 of them,

12:48.461 --> 12:51.637
but all you need is that 100th
professor to sleep with you...

12:51.762 --> 12:55.080
- You know, metaphorically.
- Is there a dobler's for teachers?

12:55.205 --> 12:57.225
- Where do smart people hang out?
- Computer stores!

12:57.569 --> 12:59.327
- Ethnic restaurants!
- The moon?

12:59.452 --> 13:00.862
Dr. Larsen's book signing!

13:00.987 --> 13:04.215
There's gonna be tons of professors.
There's gotta be one that'll sponsor me.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.647
And I'll go for moral support.

13:06.772 --> 13:08.671
And the open bar.

13:08.796 --> 13:11.625
- Thanks, but I don't think I need...
- Open bar.

13:17.968 --> 13:19.806
Is grant around?

13:19.931 --> 13:22.431
He's down the hall taking a shower.

13:22.556 --> 13:24.261
I'm just gonna come back.

13:25.295 --> 13:28.462
Actually, can I talk
to you for a second?

13:32.768 --> 13:35.605
Things seem kinda weird
between me and grant.

13:36.719 --> 13:38.357
How...

13:38.482 --> 13:42.446
- terrible.
- And I think it's because of this.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.676
Is grant cheating on me?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.483
No, the "c" is...

13:51.608 --> 13:53.014
It's me.

13:59.303 --> 14:00.406
Of course!

14:00.531 --> 14:03.758
I just assumed from the beautiful
wrapping that it was from a girl!

14:03.926 --> 14:05.510
Should've used a gift bag.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.101
We're all going to Dobler's
for Grant's birthday. You should come.

14:13.749 --> 14:14.923
And bring a date!

14:15.146 --> 14:16.730
Is there someone in your life?

14:18.269 --> 14:19.065
Kinda.

14:19.862 --> 14:21.975
- Do I know them?
- Kinda.

14:32.317 --> 14:33.392
Look at this.

14:34.426 --> 14:36.285
Cap, to what do I owe the pleasure?

14:36.599 --> 14:38.467
You know, spitter's career,
the open bar.

14:38.592 --> 14:39.927
Perhaps a little...

14:41.339 --> 14:42.203
Canoodling.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.342
- I need your help meeting a professor.
- It's a done deal.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.550
I'm so dialed in here.
Gonna find you a match made in heaven.

14:48.675 --> 14:50.526
Not that I believe in that anymore.

14:50.651 --> 14:51.912
What up, Dr. Giddings?

14:52.218 --> 14:54.685
- Maybe you can introduce me to him.
- No, it's a waste of time.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.988
He'll tell you he wants
to work with you, then

14:57.113 --> 15:00.085
when it gets serious, he bails.
He's kind of a project tease.

15:00.745 --> 15:01.810
What about her?

15:02.022 --> 15:04.819
No, Dr. Alpert's saving herself
until she gets tenure.

15:05.450 --> 15:06.488
What about her?

15:07.707 --> 15:09.606
She's a student. She's irrelevant.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.917
- What about Dr. Larsen?
- The man of the hour?

15:19.367 --> 15:21.019
Come on, it's an impossible get.

15:21.144 --> 15:24.413
I've seen him make national science
grant winners cry like little girls.

15:26.023 --> 15:27.425
Anyway, I'm gonna hit the head.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.822
When I get back
we're gonna find you somebody, OK?

15:31.606 --> 15:34.063
- Larsen's the one.
- What? He's an impossible get.

15:34.188 --> 15:36.103
Stick to the plan
and play the numbers.

15:36.228 --> 15:39.389
But if I can land a big fish like him,
people will take me seriously.

15:39.514 --> 15:40.987
I won't be the anchor anymore.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.151
Foregoing the others
to get the "hot girl". It's bold,

15:45.319 --> 15:47.077
it's risky, and I like it.

15:48.199 --> 15:49.213
I'm going in.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.072
There you go.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.039
Excuse me, Dr. Larsen?

15:58.566 --> 16:00.142
I'm Rusty Cartwright.

16:01.605 --> 16:04.864
- I have this idea...
- Hey, the anchor's here!

16:08.623 --> 16:10.427
"To the anchor. To engineer

16:10.931 --> 16:11.889
is human."

16:13.191 --> 16:15.390
"The anchor?" That's an odd moniker.

16:18.938 --> 16:20.967
I come from a long line of seamen.

16:24.844 --> 16:26.248
That came out wrong.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.008
No surprise.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.450
No rager at the Psi Phi Pi house.

16:37.154 --> 16:41.202
Remember, we did this patrolling
thing once at the Omega Chi house?

16:41.511 --> 16:43.332
We really don't need
to chitchat, Case.

16:43.808 --> 16:46.514
Especially about the past.
Let's just get through this.

16:47.426 --> 16:49.127
Apparently we should stick
to elevators.

16:49.252 --> 16:51.301
- What?
- Nothing. Brownie?

16:58.856 --> 17:00.467
- You guys are all good.
- Great.

17:00.592 --> 17:02.878
We can start our
Star Trek movie marathon.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.849
Live long and prospect!

17:08.606 --> 17:10.098
So disrespectful.

17:15.916 --> 17:17.505
Tell Ashleigh what she's missing!

17:22.625 --> 17:25.098
Thanks to our
burnout brother Nitrous,

17:25.223 --> 17:28.046
we have a treat that will delight
all your senses.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.575
I think you'll appreciate
my double entendre when I say,

17:30.700 --> 17:32.155
"These brownies are...

17:32.710 --> 17:33.614
... dope."

17:36.129 --> 17:37.423
Now, beam me up!

17:40.107 --> 17:42.837
Then my team and I realized
that by polarizing diodes,

17:42.962 --> 17:46.314
we could control the movement
of electrons in a low-pressure space.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.399
Is that right?

17:47.857 --> 17:50.490
My team and I are very close
to perfecting a...

17:50.871 --> 17:53.199
two-story beer bong, so...

17:55.021 --> 17:56.741
That's... Fascinating.

17:58.737 --> 18:00.885
Would you excuse me?
I think I see Dale.

18:06.822 --> 18:08.920
It's a weird night.
How'd it go with Larsen?

18:09.856 --> 18:10.856
I blew it.

18:11.679 --> 18:12.889
Maybe we should go.

18:13.365 --> 18:15.677
Or, we can stop
ignoring the obvious.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.078
There's something we both need.
A wingman.

18:18.732 --> 18:19.697
I'm listening.

18:19.980 --> 18:21.213
I don't speak science

18:21.665 --> 18:23.017
and you've got no mojo.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.351
Well, I've got plenty of mojo,
and you've got plenty of...

18:26.476 --> 18:28.646
You know, science talk.

18:29.306 --> 18:31.735
- I could be your translator!
- And I can be your teacher greaser.

18:31.903 --> 18:35.488
By the time I'm done with Larsen,
he's gonna name a star after you.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.074
- And that star'll be called Rusty.
- Right.

18:39.665 --> 18:42.370
- Beaver? What are you doing here?
- Being sciency. Play it cool.

18:42.883 --> 18:45.039
Two chardonnays, please? Extra ice.

18:47.033 --> 18:48.676
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.888
OK, now let's figure this out.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.143
How about over here?

18:57.364 --> 19:01.108
- Studying on a saturday night?
- I'd rather not hang out in my room.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.953
Still freaked out about your roommate
kissing his sister?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.010
I'd just rather not talk about it.

19:06.135 --> 19:08.048
- There's something to talk about?
- No.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.345
How fortunate I'm here.

19:12.715 --> 19:15.445
- Are you upset because you like Grant?
- How do you know?

19:16.201 --> 19:19.157
No one uses embossed wrapping paper
unless they want to get in guy's pants.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.233
Definitely should've used
a gift bag.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.997
Look, I'm gonna tell you something

19:26.785 --> 19:29.877
as a test of your trustworthiness.
If you pass,

19:30.310 --> 19:32.045
maybe I will help you with Ashleigh.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.364
You can trust me.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.055
So Grant and I...

19:38.894 --> 19:40.659
- ... are dating.
- Grant's gay?

19:46.387 --> 19:47.150
And...

19:47.984 --> 19:51.085
He still has a girlfriend.
I mean, why didn't he tell me?

19:51.603 --> 19:53.534
And why hasn't he
come out to her yet?

19:56.611 --> 19:59.456
Sometimes it takes people
a long time to come out.

19:59.581 --> 20:00.961
Was it that easy for you?

20:01.428 --> 20:03.883
Yeah, summer after sophomore year
of high school,

20:04.008 --> 20:06.941
- I was working at express for men...
- And that's how everybody knew?

20:09.386 --> 20:10.901
Sorry. Continue.

20:11.226 --> 20:14.098
And I told some friends
that I worked with.

20:14.516 --> 20:15.713
People close to me.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.935
Yeah, it took a while,
but you gotta start somewhere.

20:18.060 --> 20:20.741
I don't know, maybe your girlfriend
should be at the top of the list.

20:20.866 --> 20:24.055
Or maybe you should just
let Grant do this his own way.

20:26.592 --> 20:30.228
Can't believe you're telling me to be
more respectful of people's feelings.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.564
Mention this to Ashleigh
when you tell her to forgive me.

20:34.927 --> 20:36.441
What are you doing tonight?

20:54.962 --> 20:56.328
Sundae bar's almost ready.

20:56.942 --> 20:59.218
I was really hoping you'd find
another hasher tonight.

20:59.343 --> 21:02.335
Yeah, I get it, you don't want me here.
But everybody I know split town

21:02.460 --> 21:04.345
because of the dry weekend, so...

21:05.031 --> 21:06.639
- You're stuck with me.
- No.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.226
My point is this is a social event.
With... Guys.

21:11.123 --> 21:14.022
And I'm a girl without a boyfriend.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.651
Yeah, don't worry, Ash.
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

21:19.591 --> 21:20.503
OK, good.

21:29.205 --> 21:32.051
Now, see? This is good clean fun.

21:34.744 --> 21:36.117
I feel kind of sick.

21:37.142 --> 21:38.630
But not... Sick.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.549
Must have been that red asphaltscreening
at the Gamma Psi house.

21:43.548 --> 21:45.440
Hey, let's just finish
checking here,

21:45.780 --> 21:46.630
and...

21:47.014 --> 21:48.381
And then go on our way.

21:50.997 --> 21:53.037
This party clearly sucks,

21:53.162 --> 21:55.939
so I'm gonna get the ball rolling
with some karaoke.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.800
Yay! Karaoke!

22:17.649 --> 22:18.624
Karaoke.

22:19.255 --> 22:23.163
Kar-a-o-ke. That's...
That's a fun word to say.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.292
Is it hot in here?

22:30.417 --> 22:32.205
I love... Music!

22:33.519 --> 22:34.978
I wish I had some maracas.

22:35.964 --> 22:37.517
That's a fun word to say, too.

22:38.163 --> 22:39.148
Maracas.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.590
It's like a furnace.

22:43.271 --> 22:46.893
Did you ever notice
how many cats are in this house?

22:47.964 --> 22:49.867
I hate cats! I hate 'em.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.953
They freak me out!

22:52.121 --> 22:53.958
They're everywhere. On the shelves,

22:54.559 --> 22:56.267
on throw pillows.

22:59.071 --> 23:00.142
Fake cats.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.755
Do you think cats put us
on their pillows?

23:03.381 --> 23:05.669
You guys are here!
These drunk simulation goggles

23:05.794 --> 23:08.284
aren't working.
Is there, like, an on/off switch?

23:16.027 --> 23:17.061
This is awesome.

23:17.624 --> 23:19.572
Let's go see
what the kitchen looks like!

23:20.958 --> 23:21.752
This way.

23:21.877 --> 23:23.157
I guess they do work.

23:27.556 --> 23:29.532
- Hey, Hilary.
- Hey, anchor.

23:31.684 --> 23:34.787
This is my friend.
He helped create the first

23:34.955 --> 23:36.873
synthetic polymers
that use hydrogen bonding

23:37.041 --> 23:39.042
to reversibly fold themselves
into nanoparticles.

23:40.377 --> 23:41.335
David Wong?

23:45.407 --> 23:46.424
Yes, I am.

23:48.134 --> 23:49.509
I was adopted.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.065
By two gay dudes.

23:52.653 --> 23:54.474
- From China.
- I'd love to hear about

23:54.642 --> 23:58.221
how you knew nucleic acids were capable
of performing such ordered folding.

23:59.128 --> 24:00.878
Or... We could talk about you.

24:02.155 --> 24:03.928
But first, let me get you
a glass of wine.

24:04.053 --> 24:07.528
Something to dull the senses
before we dive into my folding stuff.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.674
What are you doing? You were in.

24:13.799 --> 24:16.171
I know. Always leave 'em wanting more.
Besides, you helped me,

24:16.296 --> 24:17.816
now it's my turn. Thank you.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.832
Do you have any bigger glasses?

24:26.632 --> 24:29.791
Dr. Larsen, I couldn't help but notice
you were dry. Another pinot?

24:30.722 --> 24:32.053
Well, thank you.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.223
David wong.
And this is Rusty Cartwright.

24:35.526 --> 24:36.390
The seaman?

24:37.595 --> 24:40.630
Among other things. Rusty's one
of cru's brightest young minds.

24:40.755 --> 24:43.856
Between you and me, you'd be missing out
on a tremendous opportunity

24:44.024 --> 24:46.609
if you didn't hear about his amazing

24:46.777 --> 24:47.860
science thingy.

24:48.860 --> 24:51.030
Dr. Larsen, I was hoping that

24:51.198 --> 24:53.548
you might be interested
in sponsoring a project of mine.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.064
I'm sure you have a wonderful idea,
but I've already committed myself

24:57.189 --> 24:58.663
to sponsoring another student.

24:59.336 --> 25:00.823
- Come over here a minute.
- Yes.

25:00.948 --> 25:04.127
Do you gentlemen know
Dale Kettlewell?

25:12.053 --> 25:13.104
Ready? Go!

25:21.303 --> 25:22.479
Perfect combo!

25:22.854 --> 25:23.629
Sweet,

25:24.303 --> 25:25.119
salt...

25:25.244 --> 25:26.094
Cheese!

25:28.784 --> 25:29.606
Sorry.

25:32.550 --> 25:34.169
You guys are gonna love those.

25:34.984 --> 25:37.458
- So, are you having a good time?
- Cupcakes?

25:37.794 --> 25:38.831
They're good.

25:39.918 --> 25:42.547
There you go, have a cupcake.
Ashleigh? Cupcake?

25:43.604 --> 25:47.088
I said I wouldn't stand in your way.
I didn't say anything about these guys.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.574
Excuse us for a second, please.

25:54.087 --> 25:57.096
OK, since Casey's back, I think we can
handle the rest of the night from here.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.764
You think she can handle this?

25:59.456 --> 26:01.383
Yeah, no offense to the hashers
of the world,

26:01.508 --> 26:03.546
but I think Casey
can put pretzels in a bowl.

26:03.671 --> 26:06.355
That's pretty impressive,
considering she's totally high.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.448
I'm high?

26:09.811 --> 26:11.194
That's what it is!

26:13.127 --> 26:15.364
No! No! I'm supposed
to be keeping people sober.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.991
Katherine gave me a clipboard!

26:17.634 --> 26:18.600
Is this bad?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.149
They were put on sober party patrol,
in charge of the whole greek system,

26:22.274 --> 26:24.665
and they decided to
chuck it all to get high!

26:24.833 --> 26:28.502
Trust me. They sat under that table
for ten minutes pretending to be shoes.

26:29.444 --> 26:31.495
That's ridiculous.
Casey doesn't get high.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.429
Would you tell him you're not...

26:37.758 --> 26:39.513
I'm gonna go look for them.

26:49.452 --> 26:51.733
Dr. Giddings. You're such a caution!

26:55.430 --> 26:56.932
- What?
- I thought Larsen was an

26:57.057 --> 26:59.158
- "impossible get".
- It just happened, OK?

26:59.326 --> 27:02.933
We were talking and found ourselves
bonding over our mutual lack of faith.

27:03.058 --> 27:04.287
One thing led to another.

27:04.679 --> 27:06.811
Between you and me,
I think he's only agnostic.

27:06.936 --> 27:10.109
Yeah, you know, I think
I like the god-fearing Dale better.

27:10.234 --> 27:13.130
- You totally screwed me over.
- Now, spitter, come on.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.800
Now, what's one of the tenets
of a Kappa Tau friendship?

27:16.378 --> 27:20.263
Don't ever let a conquest come
between you and a friend.

27:22.618 --> 27:23.758
I'm sorry.

27:24.866 --> 27:26.018
I'm happy for you.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.896
I just wish I had the opportunity
to pitch my idea to Larsen.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.584
Why can't he sponsor you both?

27:31.857 --> 27:34.477
I don't know, it would kind of
pull focus from my project.

27:34.602 --> 27:37.530
Come on.
You don't need this as badly as I do.

27:39.363 --> 27:42.126
Though I'm not down with JC,
I still have this...

27:42.950 --> 27:44.745
... weird desire
to do the right thing.

27:45.948 --> 27:49.041
All right. I guess it would be OK
if you gave it a shot.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.982
Thanks, man. I won't forget this.

27:53.628 --> 27:54.922
You need a wingman?

27:56.289 --> 27:57.662
This time, I'm flying solo!

28:06.990 --> 28:09.287
- I couldn't find them downstairs.
- They're not up here too.

28:09.412 --> 28:11.843
- Maybe they went outside.
- No, they wouldn't be outside!

28:11.968 --> 28:14.150
The one time Casey got high,
she was terrified of trees.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.443
You know. You can...

28:15.944 --> 28:18.154
Just go. I'll find her.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.364
I'm not gonna leave you
when your friend's missing.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.321
I know, i'm a lot of things,

28:23.446 --> 28:25.870
but I'm not someone who bails
when there's a problem.

28:27.341 --> 28:28.897
I'll go check the pantry again.

28:40.991 --> 28:43.421
Katherine will never find us
in here.

28:43.546 --> 28:45.077
Relax. Try...

28:45.766 --> 28:46.635
Lavender.

28:47.768 --> 28:48.737
That is calming.

28:48.862 --> 28:51.818
And one of my favorites,
pina colada.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.544
- I want to taste it.
- No, don't.

28:55.888 --> 28:58.928
It's my job to keep you
from eating beauty products.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.575
- I just got sad.
- I know.

29:05.121 --> 29:07.400
I wish we had
real pina coladas, too.

29:08.472 --> 29:10.206
Stupid dry weekend.

29:12.478 --> 29:14.752
I used to have so much fun with you.

29:15.458 --> 29:18.714
Before you cheated on me and hit rusty
with a pledge paddle and...

29:19.168 --> 29:21.600
... paid off a lambda sig
and dated Frannie.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.726
I know, right?

29:25.450 --> 29:28.349
You know, I was a little surprised
to see you tonight.

29:29.216 --> 29:31.071
I thought you'd try
to get out of it.

29:31.878 --> 29:33.665
I wouldn't... I did.

29:36.236 --> 29:38.526
Yeah, I guess
I left quite an impression.

29:42.736 --> 29:45.366
I think I've been
such a jerk because...

29:45.848 --> 29:48.393
Whenever I'm around you
it just reminds me

29:48.518 --> 29:50.551
of all the bad crap I did to you.

29:55.730 --> 29:58.506
Do you ever wish we could go back
to freshman year?

29:59.006 --> 30:01.298
You, me and Cappie
hanging in the dorms.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.717
Eating ramen. That was so good!

30:04.487 --> 30:06.193
You two having contests

30:06.318 --> 30:08.170
on who could grow a goatee faster?

30:09.933 --> 30:11.100
Hairy bastard.

30:11.832 --> 30:14.004
I hardly ever see him anymore and...

30:14.496 --> 30:17.303
You...
You two don't even talk at all.

30:18.762 --> 30:19.817
I talked to him.

30:20.551 --> 30:22.336
At the end of the world party.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.782
You... You talked to Cappie?
What about?

30:28.348 --> 30:29.108
You.

30:32.857 --> 30:34.456
He was on his way to see you.

30:35.928 --> 30:38.193
I told him I didn't think
it was such a good idea.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.394
I said...

30:42.510 --> 30:43.924
You guys had been there.

30:44.261 --> 30:45.117
And...

30:45.464 --> 30:47.338
It didn't work out then, so...

30:48.423 --> 30:49.875
What would be different now?

30:53.393 --> 30:55.582
I really wasn't trying
to mess you guys up.

30:56.329 --> 30:57.749
I was just being honest.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.853
You know what?
If he wanted to come, he would have.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.923
That's it! That's it!
I'm trying the pina colada!

31:26.763 --> 31:27.962
No, don't! Don't!

31:28.470 --> 31:29.512
I did it once!

31:29.680 --> 31:31.598
- Was it delicious?
- It was nasty!

31:32.099 --> 31:33.379
So nasty!

31:33.725 --> 31:35.314
But you can smell it. Here.

31:37.999 --> 31:40.242
Excuse me. Hey, Dr. Larsen.

31:40.367 --> 31:42.933
I know you've already chosen Dale,
but I'd never be able

31:43.058 --> 31:46.403
to live with myself if I left this party
without telling you my idea.

31:47.084 --> 31:47.821
Please.

31:48.671 --> 31:52.618
You know, that kind of determination
is what got me on Charlie Rose.

31:54.398 --> 31:55.276
Go on.

31:55.966 --> 31:58.547
It's inspired
by environmental factors

31:58.672 --> 32:02.086
and how we're creating new land masses
with all our waste.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.675
I think we can create eco-polymers
from recycled biodegradables.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.559
You mean like turning carbon dioxide

32:07.684 --> 32:09.473
- into synthetic material?
- Exactly!

32:09.688 --> 32:11.684
There's a method to use
certain recycled materials

32:11.809 --> 32:13.514
in lighter, stronger
and cheaper ways.

32:14.764 --> 32:15.724
I'm impressed.

32:16.241 --> 32:16.985
Really?

32:17.274 --> 32:20.754
But I only work with students
who excel academically.

32:20.879 --> 32:23.439
And since I'd never heard of you
until this evening,

32:23.564 --> 32:25.824
you must not fall
into that category.

32:26.085 --> 32:27.756
But I can offer you a position

32:27.881 --> 32:30.531
assisting Mr. Kettlewell
on his project.

32:30.928 --> 32:34.239
Wait, before you give me an answer,
I think it's only fair that you know.

32:35.047 --> 32:36.163
He's an atheist.

32:44.048 --> 32:45.569
Isn't this perfect?

32:45.694 --> 32:49.443
The four of us on a double date
for my baby's birthday.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.886
Last year for Calvin's birthday
we stayed at this cute little B&B

32:53.054 --> 32:55.583
on Canyon Lake.
Remember how romantic it was, honey?

32:56.465 --> 32:58.346
You guys are such a cute couple.

32:58.471 --> 32:59.505
The cutest!

33:00.405 --> 33:02.220
You know what would be perfect
right now?

33:02.345 --> 33:03.824
Isn't it perfect enough?

33:05.335 --> 33:07.067
- Presents!
- No, no, no!

33:08.884 --> 33:11.030
I mean, this is the kind of present

33:11.198 --> 33:13.699
that should be opened only
when the time is right.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.955
- Why? What'd we get him?
- Well, it's his birthday.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.578
What time could be more right?

33:19.739 --> 33:22.082
Once you open it,
you can't take it back.

33:22.384 --> 33:24.585
And I wouldn't want you
to have to open it here,

33:24.989 --> 33:27.338
now, just because I gave it to you.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.023
Why don't I just open it later?

33:29.503 --> 33:31.374
Don't be silly. Open it!

33:31.499 --> 33:33.223
OK, fine, I'll open it for you.

33:33.818 --> 33:34.803
I'm gay!

33:34.971 --> 33:36.305
And... And I have

33:36.473 --> 33:39.261
inappropriate feelings
for my straight roommate and

33:39.386 --> 33:41.138
this gift is proof of that.

33:50.849 --> 33:53.245
You're what?!
No wonder you never kiss me with tongue!

33:53.370 --> 33:55.366
- How long have you been gay?
- Enough!

33:58.002 --> 34:01.205
Would you two mind
giving Whitney and I some time?

34:01.811 --> 34:03.966
- But, Grant, you don't have to...
- Please.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.712
You've been really great
these last couple days.

34:10.835 --> 34:12.091
It's time to be honest.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.036
Honest about what?

34:17.373 --> 34:18.918
- Let's go.
- We're leaving?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.648
- But it's just starting to get good.
- Come on.

34:21.889 --> 34:24.666
That's the problem in our couple.
We never do anything fun!

34:24.978 --> 34:26.667
That's why I don't date girls.

34:29.743 --> 34:32.583
I'm going to take a little break,
but I'll be back.

34:33.360 --> 34:34.902
Don't even think about it.

34:38.235 --> 34:39.813
Casey and Evan must've left.

34:40.440 --> 34:43.621
I can stay until she gets back.
Or I could drive around and look.

34:44.431 --> 34:45.248
No more.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.335
You don't get to be the good guy while
I sit around being the bitter bitch.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.502
It's not fair.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.188
Fisher, I'm starting
to feel sorry for you.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.175
But then it goes away
and I want to punch you really hard.

34:55.342 --> 34:58.637
- Then punch me, please.
- No, it'll not make me feel any better.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.471
I was right. Doesn't
make me feel any better.

35:06.596 --> 35:09.603
What would? I'm just trying to
make you happy. But

35:09.728 --> 35:11.592
everything I try seems
to make it worse.

35:11.717 --> 35:14.092
Because it does.
It keeps reminding me

35:14.217 --> 35:16.283
of what a great guy
I thought you were.

35:16.408 --> 35:18.646
I can still be that guy.

35:18.771 --> 35:21.826
Tell me what you want.
I don't know what you want me to do.

35:22.068 --> 35:24.622
- You want me to quit?
- I don't know. Maybe?

35:27.043 --> 35:29.568
OK. Then I quit.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.685
- Wait!
- Hello?

35:39.281 --> 35:40.769
Where's casey cartwright?

35:40.894 --> 35:42.780
The zbz casey cartwright?

35:43.486 --> 35:44.827
I'm right here!

35:47.512 --> 35:49.251
We totally got this.

35:51.062 --> 35:52.987
Dude! Be cool! Be cool.

36:02.857 --> 36:04.471
Where have you guys been?

36:04.596 --> 36:07.026
Where haven't we been?

36:07.332 --> 36:10.797
We talked about our lives,
childhood...

36:10.922 --> 36:12.646
... time travel.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.387
I'm talking about tonight.
You only went to five houses.

36:15.990 --> 36:19.264
We had issues with
the karaoke machine!

36:19.623 --> 36:22.112
So, casey cartwright to the rescue.

36:22.237 --> 36:24.515
She's like our sober superhero.

36:24.684 --> 36:27.119
I thought you were gonna
take this more seriously.

36:27.311 --> 36:29.257
The whole point of tonight
was to do the patrols

36:29.382 --> 36:31.386
and make sure everyone stayed sober.

36:31.511 --> 36:34.729
But it's clear that what's most
important to you is having fun.

36:37.244 --> 36:39.664
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

36:42.567 --> 36:46.161
We may have gotten a
little... Side-tracked tonight,

36:46.330 --> 36:49.549
sure, but casey is a great
addition to pan-hellenic.

36:49.792 --> 36:51.941
First of all, she loves it. Right?

36:52.211 --> 36:54.293
Yeah, the binders, the meetings,

36:54.549 --> 36:58.089
the giant copy machine that
makes those cool pamphlets.

36:58.214 --> 37:00.185
How could you not love it?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.712
Right.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.179
We may not have made
it to all the houses,

37:04.481 --> 37:07.151
but this is the only dry weekend
that hasn't totally sucked.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.089
That's all because of casey.

37:10.693 --> 37:12.562
You're lucky to have her.

37:12.732 --> 37:14.335
Thanks, evan.

37:15.913 --> 37:19.194
She may be afraid of trees,
but when push comes to shove,

37:19.687 --> 37:21.790
she doesn't let you
drink the shampoo.

37:21.915 --> 37:24.042
No matter how good it smells.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.410
Thanks, evan.

37:29.519 --> 37:31.809
- Are they stoned?
- Yeah.

37:44.873 --> 37:47.702
Nice work getting hilary's
number. You gonna call her?

37:48.081 --> 37:50.968
I don't know. She was cute,

37:51.317 --> 37:54.687
but for the first time in my life,
I felt a little dumb around a girl.

37:56.175 --> 37:57.677
You're not dumb.

37:58.753 --> 38:01.304
And that's not fair for her
to make you feel that way.

38:02.330 --> 38:04.875
What's she judging you on, anyway?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.644
One conversation?

38:06.769 --> 38:10.200
- One bad grade on a midterm?
- Calm down.

38:11.033 --> 38:14.343
"No one can make you feel
inferior without your permission."

38:17.001 --> 38:19.838
It's actually "without your
consent," but you're right.

38:21.418 --> 38:24.072
The good news is you
got in with Dr. Larsen.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.844
Glad you got what you wanted.

38:28.137 --> 38:29.755
I guess.

38:33.205 --> 38:36.255
Did you see the way katherine
left to go bust the psi phi pis?

38:36.380 --> 38:38.565
She went so fast, she
blurred like a cartoon.

38:43.693 --> 38:45.238
Fisher quit tonight.

38:47.953 --> 38:50.624
Is that... Good?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.429
I don't know.

38:53.626 --> 38:55.696
I thought it was what I wanted.

38:56.858 --> 39:00.407
But if it is,
why do I feel so crappy?

39:03.768 --> 39:05.727
I Miss him.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.888
Do you think you
could trust him again?

39:13.573 --> 39:15.227
I think I want to try.

39:16.278 --> 39:19.676
But I drew a line in the sand.
Cheating is a deal-breaker.

39:20.395 --> 39:22.728
What does that say about me?

39:24.062 --> 39:26.077
It says you're a human being

39:26.202 --> 39:28.553
that understands life
isn't always black and white.

39:29.589 --> 39:32.760
Deciding to forgive someone
can be a sign of strength.

39:36.510 --> 39:38.362
Like you forgiving evan?

39:39.942 --> 39:41.837
Something like that.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.910
So, how'd it go?

39:51.450 --> 39:54.483
I don't see any blood,
so that's gotta be good.

39:56.634 --> 39:58.805
Whitney took it better
than I expected.

40:00.186 --> 40:02.143
She said she knew something
was up when I started

40:02.268 --> 40:04.109
shopping at express for men.

40:06.666 --> 40:10.311
I just hope I didn't force you

40:10.436 --> 40:13.828
- to come out before you were ready.
- No, I'm glad this happened.

40:15.592 --> 40:18.461
I just feel bad
I pulled you into all this.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.325
It wasn't fair.

40:22.794 --> 40:24.135
I'm sorry.

40:29.101 --> 40:30.997
Happy birthday.

40:46.289 --> 40:47.917
I really love it.

41:02.281 --> 41:03.709
You got my check?

41:18.841 --> 41:21.705
We're looking for a new hasher.
If you know of anyone.

41:22.605 --> 41:26.020
Someone who works
hard, shows up on time,

41:26.321 --> 41:28.800
has his own transportation.

41:28.925 --> 41:30.778
Like, a motorcycle.

41:33.098 --> 41:34.908
I know a guy.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.742
Class m license and everything.

41:39.722 --> 41:41.880
Is he trustworthy?

41:42.005 --> 41:44.694
Absolutely. In fact if
you give him a chance,

41:45.227 --> 41:47.648
i'm sure he'll prove it to you.

41:48.849 --> 41:50.759
OK then. He's hired.

41:52.985 --> 41:54.302
Really?

41:55.365 --> 41:57.848
Yeah. But it's only probationary.

41:58.386 --> 42:01.775
'cause you really screwed up, and...

42:01.900 --> 42:04.521
I'm not used to
giving second chances.

42:04.690 --> 42:08.235
I know. And you won't regret it.

42:10.096 --> 42:11.652
I hope not.

42:32.856 --> 42:36.275
I understand you turned down an
opportunity to work with Dr. Larsen.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.382
I'm intrigued.
But it could just mean you're stupid.

42:39.507 --> 42:42.120
I'd rather take a chance
working on my own project,

42:42.245 --> 42:44.946
even if they call me
"anchor" until I graduate.

42:45.071 --> 42:48.153
At least I won't be getting
in line to suck up to larsen.

42:48.278 --> 42:50.596
So what, he was on charlie rose?

42:50.849 --> 42:53.757
I don't want flash,
I want substance.

42:53.882 --> 42:56.827
Stop trying to sweet talk
me, cartwright. I'll do it.

42:56.952 --> 42:59.257
- Do what?
- Sponsor you.

43:00.488 --> 43:03.549
But... I thought you
don't do those things.

43:03.674 --> 43:06.092
Normally, I don't, but
I actually think your ideas

43:06.217 --> 43:08.903
about eco-polymers are not
the worst thing in the world.

43:09.028 --> 43:10.993
I never even told you my ideas.

43:11.118 --> 43:13.649
I'm not deaf. I've heard
you yammer on all year long.

43:13.774 --> 43:16.456
I just pretend not to be listening
so as not to encourage you.

43:16.678 --> 43:18.666
Does this mean we're a team?

43:19.235 --> 43:22.195
I'm already starting
to regret it. Go.
