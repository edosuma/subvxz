this ropes course my bitch.

23:25.417 --> 23:26.417
- Your feet are right there.

23:26.458 --> 23:27.750
Just lift them up a little bit.

23:27.792 --> 23:28.917

23:50.292 --> 23:51.624
He's in my corner.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.292
- carrying me
- through this thing.

His voice is making me

23:56.397 --> 23:57.457

- You have this,

23:58.626 --> 23:59.791
this is nothing for you now.

- This ropes course,

24:30.336 --> 24:31.666
it's kind of like a metaphor

24:31.667 --> 24:32.709
where regardless

24:32.710 --> 24:33.750
of all the obstacles,

24:33.792 --> 24:35.458
if you just push through it,

you'll find a happy place

- Yeah.

25:08.833 --> 25:10.354

but it feels like old times.

25:11.917 --> 25:14.708
- Whoa.

25:14.750 --> 25:16.563
- I mean, it's, like, back to

25:16.564 --> 25:18.375
where we were five years ago.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.374
- Yeah, rez.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.792
Whoa.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.146
I kind of feel, like,

25:41.147 --> 25:42.458
mission impossible right now

25:42.500 --> 25:43.667
because at the end,

25:43.668 --> 25:44.833
the mission was possible

25:44.875 --> 25:46.958
and I completed the task.

to bring things up.

27:16.334 --> 27:17.832

27:26.084 --> 27:27.833

- How do you feel vulnerable?

- about my mom.

- really brought up

27:38.708 --> 27:42.292
a lot of deep, raw, emotions.

27:42.333 --> 27:43.979
And it reminded me

27:43.980 --> 27:45.625
that my mom really stood by

27:45.667 --> 27:48.250
on the sidelines in her life

27:48.292 --> 27:49.625
and she chose to play it safe.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.417
And part of me feels really sad

27:51.418 --> 27:53.167
for her

27:53.208 --> 27:54.666

27:54.667 --> 27:56.480
- Has she ever felt

27:56.481 --> 27:58.292
a consequence from her actions,

27:58.333 --> 27:59.438
or did she just think

27:59.439 --> 28:00.541
she's right, period?

she is not trying to be that

28:08.543 --> 28:10.708

- how to do it better.

28:19.542 --> 28:21.438
My mom got hurt,

28:21.439 --> 28:23.333
her heart got broken.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.874
She made a decision

28:25.875 --> 28:28.375
to never take

28:28.376 --> 28:30.874
a chance on love again.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.042
She really built a cocoon

28:32.043 --> 28:33.208
around herself,

28:33.250 --> 28:35.000
and here she is now,

28:35.001 --> 28:36.749

if you're not

28:41.418 --> 28:42.418
in a relationship.

28:42.458 --> 28:43.854

a completely better life

28:45.250 --> 28:46.250
if she would've

28:46.251 --> 28:47.251
taken some risks.
