00:01.978 --> 00:03.590
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.592 --> 00:06.560
What will I ever do without you?
What if you could take the cure?

00:07.531 --> 00:09.613
When the door between this world

00:09.615 --> 00:11.382
and Cade's gets cracked open,

00:11.384 --> 00:12.649
it wipes out everything.

00:12.651 --> 00:14.218
All of us in Mystic Falls.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.504
All you got to do is
make sure that bell rings.

00:16.529 --> 00:18.122
12 times. What do you say, Stefan?

00:18.124 --> 00:19.656
You need a Maxwell to ring that bell,

00:19.658 --> 00:20.524
and I'm not touching it.

00:20.526 --> 00:21.658
Oh, yes, you are, Matt.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.127
I'm about to burn Mystic Falls

00:23.129 --> 00:24.628
to the ground.

00:26.347 --> 00:28.314
I ain't gonna let it happen.

00:36.175 --> 00:38.242
I will do whatever it takes.

00:38.244 --> 00:39.510
I'm getting you back.

00:39.512 --> 00:41.278
Cade, how are you here?

00:41.280 --> 00:43.280
The bell rang 11 times.

00:44.216 --> 00:45.749
I'll handle it from here.

00:54.827 --> 00:56.949
There's so many options.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.563
"Nitro brew"?

00:59.565 --> 01:01.031
"Flat white"?

01:01.033 --> 01:03.267
"Sea salt and smoked chili latte"?

01:04.736 --> 01:06.235
These are complicated times.

01:06.260 --> 01:08.505
It's Mystic Falls'
attempt to be hipster.

01:08.507 --> 01:11.408
If you want simple, go
for the straight drip.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.077
Hmm.

01:13.079 --> 01:14.578
Thanks for the insight.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.180
Good luck.

01:18.017 --> 01:19.917
I would like a straight drip.

01:19.919 --> 01:20.918
For here or to go?

01:20.920 --> 01:22.086
To go, please.

01:27.159 --> 01:28.358
Keep the change.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.598
Appreciate it.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.328
I know you've been
stretching your paycheck

01:31.330 --> 01:33.063
while you try to
impress your boss's wife.

01:33.088 --> 01:35.176
You didn't have to try so hard.

01:35.201 --> 01:36.400
Based on what I see in your memory,

01:36.402 --> 01:39.169
money was the least of her needs.

01:39.171 --> 01:40.637
Now,

01:40.639 --> 01:41.772
you were right to wonder

01:41.774 --> 01:42.673
about all of her lunch dates.

01:42.675 --> 01:45.609
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

01:46.655 --> 01:48.745
Always at his place.

01:48.747 --> 01:49.986
Hmm.

01:59.308 --> 02:00.474
Hmm.

02:08.934 --> 02:13.604
Update from the outside world.

02:13.606 --> 02:15.005
Don't care.

02:15.007 --> 02:16.073
But I do.

02:16.075 --> 02:17.875
I care so much, it hurts.

02:17.877 --> 02:19.276
But it's a good kind of hurt.

02:19.278 --> 02:21.178
Because my lovely humanity is back on

02:21.180 --> 02:24.481
and I am seeing the world
through rose-colored glasses.

02:24.483 --> 02:26.183
Oh, God, when you say things like that,

02:26.185 --> 02:28.485
it really makes me regret
not destroying Mystic Falls

02:28.487 --> 02:29.753
with hellfire.

02:29.755 --> 02:31.021
Maybe Seline'll ring that bell again

02:31.023 --> 02:32.956
and put me out of my misery.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.391
Don't hold your breath, brother.

02:34.393 --> 02:36.693
Psycho sisters are MIA.

02:36.695 --> 02:38.795
It's almost as if

02:38.797 --> 02:40.623
all is right with the world.

02:40.648 --> 02:42.766
Yeah, except for the fact that
we made a deal with the devil.

02:42.768 --> 02:44.201
You should be out dropping bodies

02:44.203 --> 02:45.702
and keeping our numbers up, Damon.

02:45.704 --> 02:47.304
Stefan Salvatore,

02:47.306 --> 02:49.406
dropping bodies is not part of

02:49.408 --> 02:51.875
a balanced, humanity-on lifestyle.

02:51.877 --> 02:53.610
Sorry, I fell asleep.

02:53.612 --> 02:55.779
That's okay. I forgive you.

02:55.781 --> 02:57.481
I'm all about redemption these days.

02:57.483 --> 02:59.216
I am gonna set things right.

02:59.218 --> 03:01.852
Starting with your humanity switch.

03:01.854 --> 03:04.054
When did you become such a nag?

03:04.056 --> 03:06.390
Maybe you've been hanging out
with my ex-fiancÃ©e too much.

03:06.392 --> 03:08.592
I'm surprised she's not
here with you right now.

03:08.594 --> 03:10.394
Telling you all the
things you're doing wrong.

03:10.396 --> 03:11.762
She had other obligations today.

03:11.764 --> 03:14.031
Contrary to your personal belief,

03:14.033 --> 03:15.832
it's not all about you.

03:15.834 --> 03:17.267
You look hungry.

03:17.269 --> 03:19.303
I'm gonna make pancakes.

03:29.415 --> 03:31.181
Welcome, everybody.

03:31.183 --> 03:33.884
As part of our ramp-up
to Founder's Day,

03:33.886 --> 03:35.485
our high school
students have followed up

03:35.487 --> 03:40.123
on a local legend about a
time capsule buried in 1790.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.392
With the help of our historical society,

03:42.394 --> 03:44.728
they went digging for treasure.

03:44.730 --> 03:47.531
And this is what they found.

03:54.473 --> 03:56.974
Left behind by the first settlers,

03:56.976 --> 04:00.444
it hasn't been opened until... now.

04:16.394 --> 04:18.295
Hey. You okay?

04:18.297 --> 04:19.696
You looked a little shaky up there.

04:19.697 --> 04:21.130
Yeah, this morning's been a real mess.

04:21.132 --> 04:22.733
I got called into a
fight at a coffee shop,

04:22.735 --> 04:24.501
these two guys almost killed each other.

04:24.503 --> 04:27.437
I feel like Mystic Falls just
isn't as safe as it used to be.

04:27.439 --> 04:28.605
Tell me about it.

04:28.607 --> 04:31.208
Is that ancient Tupperware?

04:31.210 --> 04:35.045
Elena, Bonnie and I
made our own time capsule

04:35.047 --> 04:37.948
when we were 11 and buried
it right under this tree.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.284
And I cannot believe it is still here.

04:40.286 --> 04:41.752
Look at this.

04:41.754 --> 04:43.920
Oh...

04:43.922 --> 04:45.255
Oh, my gosh,

04:45.257 --> 04:46.657
look at your mom's hair.

04:46.659 --> 04:49.307
Oh, Miranda Gilbert.

04:51.330 --> 04:52.996
Here's Bonnie, Elena and me.

04:52.998 --> 04:55.132
Wow, we look like babies.

04:56.246 --> 04:58.869
Oh, my gosh.

05:01.073 --> 05:02.639
"Dear Future Caroline,

05:02.641 --> 05:03.540
I predict

05:03.542 --> 05:05.475
you will win a Tony Award,

05:05.477 --> 05:07.377
live in the perfect house,

05:07.379 --> 05:10.514
and marry the perfect boy"

05:11.583 --> 05:13.950
Ambitious.

05:13.952 --> 05:16.787
And sadly, inaccurate.

05:16.789 --> 05:18.021
Stefan still locked up?

05:19.329 --> 05:21.124
But I'm staying positive.

05:21.126 --> 05:23.427
I mean, look at Damon. Humanity on

05:23.429 --> 05:25.295
and he's a new person.

05:25.297 --> 05:27.597
Stefan will get his emotions back, too.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.009
What?

05:30.034 --> 05:31.635
I just wonder if he's
ever gonna feel bad

05:31.637 --> 05:32.903
for trying to make me

05:32.905 --> 05:35.238
destroy our whole town and
kill God knows how many people.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.441
- Stefan's not him...
- I know, Stefan's not himself.

05:37.443 --> 05:38.675
The sirens, the devil,

05:38.677 --> 05:39.943
the mind control.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.213
But it's still him

05:43.215 --> 05:45.449
that did all those things.

05:45.451 --> 05:47.522
It's hard to keep giving him a pass.

06:02.501 --> 06:03.600
Oh!

06:04.636 --> 06:06.837
Sorry, luv.

06:06.839 --> 06:10.307
Peter Maxwell's truck is in
dire need of shock absorbers.

06:10.309 --> 06:12.409
- You all right, luv?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:12.411 --> 06:15.312
Just a supernatural ringing in my ears.

06:15.314 --> 06:18.499
That fork-bell combo packs
a nasty psychic punch.

06:18.524 --> 06:20.751
Yeah, those tie-down
straps must have come loose.

06:20.753 --> 06:21.961
We'll stop up ahead and fix them

06:21.985 --> 06:23.630
and we'll be rid of that noisy bell,

06:23.655 --> 06:25.088
and this borrowed car in no time.

06:25.090 --> 06:26.223
Where is this

06:26.225 --> 06:28.225
secret hiding place of yours anyway?

06:28.227 --> 06:30.494
- It's a surprise.
- Okay.

06:32.664 --> 06:34.292
- Oh, my God.
- What?

06:34.317 --> 06:36.333
Caroline found my
sixth grade bucket list.

06:36.335 --> 06:37.881
Paris is on there, I presume?

06:37.905 --> 06:39.836
My tweener dreams were
not that sophisticated.

06:39.838 --> 06:41.805
"Meet Justin Timberlake,

06:41.807 --> 06:43.473
audition for American Idol,

06:43.475 --> 06:45.542
be on MTV's Spring Break..."

06:46.545 --> 06:48.145
High aspirations, indeed.

06:48.147 --> 06:50.213
Okay, don't mock my tweener self.

06:50.215 --> 06:52.649
What's on your bucket list?

06:52.651 --> 06:54.418
You know, I never thought to make one.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.919
Being immortal and all.

06:55.921 --> 06:58.889
FOMO really isn't in
the vampire vocabulary.

06:58.891 --> 07:00.924
There has to be something or...

07:00.926 --> 07:02.893
things you really want to do.

07:02.895 --> 07:05.228
Some daredevil thrills
you haven't tried.

07:05.230 --> 07:07.097
Yeah, I suppose I could think of a few.

07:07.099 --> 07:08.532
Then let's do them.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.400
Or as many of them as we can.

07:10.402 --> 07:11.468
You need to take full advantage

07:11.470 --> 07:12.869
of the perks of your immortality.

07:12.871 --> 07:14.113
While I'm still immortal, you mean?

07:14.137 --> 07:15.705
Exactly. No time like the present.

07:15.707 --> 07:17.874
Well, except we're on a mission.

07:17.876 --> 07:20.143
We'll still end up at
the same destination.

07:20.145 --> 07:22.746
Why not make the journey an adventure?

07:25.884 --> 07:28.919
Second chances, coming up.

07:28.921 --> 07:31.421
I dare you to have one
of these and tell me that

07:31.423 --> 07:33.957
they are not the best
pancakes you ever...

07:33.959 --> 07:35.625
had.

07:57.649 --> 07:59.549
Where the hell is my brother?

07:59.551 --> 08:02.652
Making up for your
disappointing work ethic.

08:02.654 --> 08:03.954
I sent him on a task.

08:03.956 --> 08:06.056
You're wondering

08:06.058 --> 08:07.824
if I'm a hallucination.

08:07.826 --> 08:09.292
Well, I assure you,

08:09.294 --> 08:11.379
I am very real.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.766
Noted.

08:18.070 --> 08:20.437
What brings you to town?

08:20.439 --> 08:22.095
Upon the Maxwell bell's 11th ring,

08:22.120 --> 08:24.007
the boundary to hell

08:24.009 --> 08:25.375
broke down for a moment.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.344
I took the opportunity to step through

08:27.346 --> 08:29.112
and take up residence here.

08:29.114 --> 08:32.515
Since my disciples seem to
require additional motivation.

08:34.436 --> 08:37.354
Don't think I want to know
what you did to motivate Stefan.

08:37.356 --> 08:39.990
Mm, fire is only one of
the tools at my disposal.

08:39.991 --> 08:42.325
But he hardly needed
prompting to go back to work.

08:42.327 --> 08:44.628
Now it's your turn to
make up the deficit.

08:44.630 --> 08:47.130
By sundown tonight, you
will kill 100 people...

08:47.132 --> 08:49.065
Here's the thing. I don't really feel

08:49.067 --> 08:51.902
like being your Terminator anymore.

08:51.904 --> 08:55.672
Your feelings are a non-issue.

08:55.674 --> 08:57.374
Our arrangement is very clear.

08:57.376 --> 09:00.911
Do as I say and you won't go to hell.

09:00.913 --> 09:02.245
Disobey me,

09:02.247 --> 09:04.314
and I send you there to stay.

09:04.316 --> 09:06.082
So here's your second option.

09:06.084 --> 09:09.719
If you object to quantity, I
will accept quality instead.

09:09.721 --> 09:10.854
Quality?

09:10.856 --> 09:13.557
Like the queen of England quality?

09:13.559 --> 09:15.859
Quality like...

09:15.861 --> 09:17.360
Caroline Forbes.

09:17.362 --> 09:20.297
Oh. Well, she's a bit of

09:20.299 --> 09:21.731
a no-fly zone. You know what I mean?

09:21.733 --> 09:23.567
It's completely up to you.

09:23.569 --> 09:25.502
Before the sun goes down,

09:25.504 --> 09:27.871
kill 100 evil strangers,

09:27.873 --> 09:30.488
or kill the love of your brother's life.

09:52.872 --> 09:54.171
I got a question for you.

09:54.173 --> 09:55.606
You know I'm a person, right?

09:55.608 --> 09:57.708
Like, I'm not just your human Wikipedia.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.043
Hi, Matt, how are you?

09:59.045 --> 10:00.811
I'm great. Slammed with work,

10:00.813 --> 10:03.848
but really enjoying this
unseasonably warm weather.

10:03.850 --> 10:06.150
Hi, Dorian. I don't
care about the weather.

10:06.152 --> 10:08.386
I need you to tell me what this is.

10:08.388 --> 10:09.587
Whoa.

10:09.589 --> 10:11.522
- Where did you get that from?
- A time capsule

10:11.524 --> 10:14.158
from the 18th century settlement
that became Mystic Falls.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.259
It's a cardan grille.

10:15.261 --> 10:16.293
It's a cipher device

10:16.295 --> 10:17.361
used for code-breaking.

10:17.363 --> 10:18.462
Secret message style.

10:18.464 --> 10:20.164
Why would it have a Maxwell crest on it?

10:20.166 --> 10:22.199
Maybe you're descended
from a family of spies.

10:22.201 --> 10:24.035
Wouldn't be the weirdest thing
I've heard in the last few days.

10:24.037 --> 10:26.337
Thanks.

10:26.339 --> 10:27.972
Yeah, this looks great.

10:27.974 --> 10:29.710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:33.212 --> 10:35.012
You are supposed to be on Stefan duty.

10:35.014 --> 10:36.647
Well, there's no point now.

10:36.649 --> 10:38.182
Cade's in town. He set our boy free.

10:38.184 --> 10:38.928
What?

10:38.953 --> 10:40.317
He also told me to kill you.

10:40.319 --> 10:41.358
Damon...

10:41.383 --> 10:42.920
Of course I have a
plan "B", Blondie.

10:42.922 --> 10:44.288
Hold on, back up.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.623
- Where is Stefan now?
- I don't know.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.224
Wherever he is, he's
not answering his phone.

10:51.164 --> 10:52.663
Points for optimism.

10:52.665 --> 10:54.632
- Voice mail.
- Mm-hmm.

10:54.634 --> 10:56.233
How is this even possible?

10:56.235 --> 10:57.535
I thought Cade was supposed to live

10:57.537 --> 10:59.837
in some kind of psychic dimension.

10:59.839 --> 11:01.872
You mean his realm of pain and fire? No.

11:01.874 --> 11:03.981
That's just his vacation
home. He's here to stay.

11:04.006 --> 11:05.950
Does your plan "B" account for that?

11:05.975 --> 11:06.744
Of course it does.

11:06.746 --> 11:07.912
This may come as a surprise to you,

11:07.914 --> 11:10.147
but you're not the
only optimist in town.

11:10.149 --> 11:12.183
Now, let's get these yahoos

11:12.185 --> 11:14.218
somewhere safe. Stay clear, yourself.

11:14.220 --> 11:15.686
Cade gave me till
sundown to kill a hundred

11:15.688 --> 11:17.221
of these people or kill you instead,

11:17.223 --> 11:19.590
and I don't want to
be tempted by either.

11:19.592 --> 11:20.858
Well, where are you going?

11:20.860 --> 11:22.259
Less you know, the better.

11:22.261 --> 11:23.427
We're up against a mind reader

11:23.429 --> 11:25.496
who's also a pyromaniac.

11:25.498 --> 11:27.898
But I'm sure it'll all be fine.

12:05.271 --> 12:07.271
That was unbelievable!

12:07.273 --> 12:09.540
I should've done this long ago.

12:12.211 --> 12:13.811
Mm.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.614
Happy is a good look on you.

12:16.616 --> 12:18.916
Eh, doesn't take much. Fast car,

12:18.918 --> 12:20.184
beautiful girl.

12:20.186 --> 12:21.786
I'm a clichÃ©.

12:22.722 --> 12:23.754
What's next?

12:23.756 --> 12:25.189
What, there's more?

12:25.191 --> 12:26.757
You tell me. There's got to be more

12:26.759 --> 12:28.259
on your bucket list than drag racing.

12:28.261 --> 12:30.127
Um...

12:30.129 --> 12:31.395
Mm...

12:31.397 --> 12:32.930
Skydiving has some appeal.

12:32.932 --> 12:36.033
Okay. I think there's a
place about an hour away.

12:38.438 --> 12:39.704
Hey.

12:39.729 --> 12:41.229
What's really on your mind?

12:43.376 --> 12:45.176
If you're gonna take the cure,

12:45.178 --> 12:47.444
if you're gonna become human,

12:47.446 --> 12:49.413
I just want to make sure there's
nothing you missed out on.

12:49.415 --> 12:52.216
Not if I take the cure. When.

12:52.218 --> 12:53.951
Do you not know me at all,

12:53.953 --> 12:55.386
Bonnie Bennett?

12:55.388 --> 12:57.421
If I say I'll do a thing,

12:57.423 --> 12:59.990
I'll do it.

13:06.365 --> 13:07.731
But...

13:07.733 --> 13:10.901
if you insist on more fun...

13:10.903 --> 13:12.002
Yes.

13:12.004 --> 13:13.938
...skydiving it is.

13:16.943 --> 13:18.609
After one more go-round in this beauty.

13:18.611 --> 13:21.045
Yeah.

13:21.047 --> 13:23.013
That's right, everyone! Happy hour,

13:23.015 --> 13:24.682
all day long.

13:28.955 --> 13:30.588
What's this about?

13:30.590 --> 13:32.857
Oh, you know. Just
Damon being told to kill

13:32.859 --> 13:35.659
a hundred people, or
else kill me instead.

13:35.661 --> 13:37.361
Just... standard afternoon special.

13:37.363 --> 13:38.629
- Who told him that?
- Cade.

13:38.631 --> 13:40.064
By the way, he's out in the world.

13:40.066 --> 13:42.233
Walking around, taking in the sights.

13:42.235 --> 13:43.734
Look, Damon's on it.

13:43.736 --> 13:45.636
He's got a plan.

13:45.638 --> 13:48.405
But in the meantime,

13:48.407 --> 13:50.594
I made you something. Just in case.

13:50.619 --> 13:52.543
It's a blood orange margarita.

13:52.545 --> 13:54.245
Emphasis on the blood.

13:54.247 --> 13:56.046
Specifically, my blood.

13:57.550 --> 13:59.850
I know you mean well.

13:59.852 --> 14:03.120
But if Mystic Falls goes up in
flames, I'd rather go with it.

14:03.122 --> 14:04.421
Than survive?

14:04.423 --> 14:06.924
Becoming a vampire
isn't survival, Caroline.

14:06.926 --> 14:10.127
It's a death sentence all the same.

14:21.707 --> 14:24.475
I expected to find you busier.

14:25.678 --> 14:27.278
I am busy.

14:27.280 --> 14:29.079
Just staying out of trouble.

14:29.081 --> 14:31.315
Well, that's contrary to your task.

14:31.317 --> 14:33.751
Yeah, but I'm on the redemption jag.

14:33.753 --> 14:35.986
See, there's this
girl I want to impress.

14:35.988 --> 14:39.590
So I'm trying not to
kill anyone. Ever again.

14:39.592 --> 14:41.692
And yet you understand the
downside of disobeying me.

14:41.694 --> 14:44.428
I just want to renegotiate our deal.

14:44.430 --> 14:45.896
You throw in the Caroline,

14:45.898 --> 14:49.033
and the whole "by sundown"
of it all into the mix,

14:49.035 --> 14:50.868
you really changed the rules.

14:53.873 --> 14:55.639
You think I'm being unfair.

14:55.641 --> 14:58.375
Nope. I just think you're being you.

14:58.377 --> 14:59.777
I could say the same of you.

14:59.779 --> 15:01.378
How very Damon Salvatore,

15:01.380 --> 15:03.213
to contemplate murdering the devil.

15:05.584 --> 15:09.386
Even now, you're gauging where
my beating heart might lie.

15:10.990 --> 15:15.392
Asking yourself if you
can best my reflexes...

15:20.399 --> 15:22.666
Question answered.

15:22.668 --> 15:26.737
And now you're wondering
if fire can kill me.

15:26.739 --> 15:28.706
Let's find out.

15:31.644 --> 15:35.012
Or were you going for
something more like this?

15:43.422 --> 15:46.056
Or detaching my heart from my body?

15:48.761 --> 15:51.228
Seen enough?

16:14.278 --> 16:15.911
Boy.

16:15.913 --> 16:18.547
These roads had me
completely turned around.

16:18.549 --> 16:21.116
Never been so happy to find
a gas station in my life.

16:21.118 --> 16:23.552
- It gets confusing around here.
- Sure does.

16:23.554 --> 16:27.056
It's partly my fault. I was
driving while distracted.

16:27.058 --> 16:28.757
Thinking about work.

16:28.759 --> 16:31.226
Not that I'm complaining.
I love what I do.

16:31.228 --> 16:33.762
Deadlines can get kind
of stressful, though.

16:33.764 --> 16:35.731
Oh, it's probably because
of who I'm working for.

16:35.733 --> 16:39.501
You ever get the feeling that
your boss can read your mind?

16:39.503 --> 16:43.605
I haven't had a boss in a
while. I run my own office.

16:43.607 --> 16:44.673
Ooh, that's smart.

16:44.675 --> 16:45.808
That's what I want to do.

16:45.810 --> 16:47.376
Go solo and ditch this partnership

16:47.378 --> 16:49.211
that's been dragging me down for years.

16:49.213 --> 16:50.312
Of course, I'd still
have to report to the guy

16:50.314 --> 16:51.880
at the top of the food chain.

16:51.882 --> 16:54.817
You know. The one who can read my mind.

16:54.819 --> 16:56.885
Right.

16:57.955 --> 17:00.889
To be clear, he is an actual psychic.

17:00.891 --> 17:03.092
He told me where to find you.

17:04.228 --> 17:06.295
That work deadline I
was telling you about?

17:09.032 --> 17:11.869
You're gonna help me with it.

17:11.895 --> 17:13.801
You put the cardan grille over text,

17:13.804 --> 17:15.170
and it reveals a hidden message.

17:15.172 --> 17:17.806
But you have to have the
right text to decrypt.

17:17.808 --> 17:19.375
I brought Harvey's
journal. It's the same era,

17:19.377 --> 17:20.909
same Maxwell crest.

17:20.911 --> 17:23.512
Maybe this device will
match something he wrote.

17:25.201 --> 17:28.102
All right, all you can
eat, time capsule prices.

17:28.127 --> 17:29.226
Any word from Damon?

17:29.251 --> 17:31.353
No, but so far I'm encouraged

17:31.355 --> 17:34.223
by the continuing lack of hellfire.

17:34.225 --> 17:36.225
What's going on?

17:37.161 --> 17:38.360
Real talk,

17:38.362 --> 17:40.229
since you're in the
circle of trust and all,

17:40.231 --> 17:42.664
the devil's in town.

17:42.666 --> 17:44.833
Arcadius? Is in Mystic Falls?

17:44.835 --> 17:47.603
That's... kind of mind-blowing.

17:47.605 --> 17:48.837
And very unsafe.

17:48.839 --> 17:49.972
Which is why you should have

17:49.974 --> 17:51.640
a supernatural insurance plan.

17:51.642 --> 17:53.442
I'm just putting the
alternative out there.

17:53.444 --> 17:54.676
There's no alternative, Caroline.

17:54.678 --> 17:56.478
It's life or death, that's it.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.247
Y-You're talking about
becoming a vampire.

17:58.249 --> 18:00.048
Alaric told me everything.

18:00.050 --> 18:02.317
All I'd have to do is drink your blood?

18:02.319 --> 18:04.720
And die.

18:04.722 --> 18:06.088
Not that that's the goal.

18:06.090 --> 18:08.657
If you don't mind me asking,

18:08.659 --> 18:10.692
what's it like, being you?

18:12.163 --> 18:16.331
Well, the lows are
low, I'm not gonna lie.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.866
But...

18:17.868 --> 18:22.271
you feel stronger than you
ever thought you could feel.

18:22.273 --> 18:23.505
Powerful.

18:23.507 --> 18:25.107
And everything's heightened.

18:25.109 --> 18:27.376
Emotions, appetites, joy...

18:27.378 --> 18:28.911
And pain.

18:28.913 --> 18:31.146
It's violence and murder.

18:31.148 --> 18:33.415
It's a choice you can never take back.

18:33.417 --> 18:36.084
It's a choice you'll regret forever.

18:36.086 --> 18:38.720
Some people don't regret it.

18:47.064 --> 18:48.564
Well, all things considered,

18:48.566 --> 18:50.165
I think we made good time.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.900
- Oh. Damn it.
- Oh.

18:51.902 --> 18:53.902
Yeah? What'd you expect?
You face-planted onto it

18:53.904 --> 18:55.671
after that BASE jump.

18:55.673 --> 18:57.139
Too bad.

18:57.141 --> 19:00.442
Missing out on some epic
zero gravity flight photos.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.711
So I don't remember my list including

19:03.736 --> 19:05.681
"start a B&B in upstate New York"

19:05.683 --> 19:09.384
I bought it a few months ago,
with money my dad left me.

19:09.386 --> 19:10.486
No one knows about it.

19:10.488 --> 19:12.421
We can stash the bell here.

19:12.423 --> 19:14.189
Brilliant.

19:14.191 --> 19:16.425
Uh, what made you buy a house
in the middle of nowhere?

19:16.427 --> 19:19.995
Oh, is it a romantic getaway for us?

19:19.997 --> 19:21.864
Hell of a gesture.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.766
Puts my blood necklace to shame.

19:24.768 --> 19:27.102
I didn't buy the house for you.

19:27.104 --> 19:28.437
Should I be worried?

19:28.439 --> 19:30.806
Probably not.

19:32.743 --> 19:35.010
How about you prove
it by giving me a tour

19:35.012 --> 19:37.045
of every single room?

19:37.047 --> 19:40.983
You are forgetting one
very important thing.

19:48.826 --> 19:50.659
Enzo St. John,

19:50.661 --> 19:52.294
I invite you in.

19:54.198 --> 19:55.631
Wait.

19:55.633 --> 19:58.467
There's something I've been imagining.

20:06.043 --> 20:08.310
One day we'll do that for real.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.747
Thank you, darling.

20:11.749 --> 20:13.849
And thank you for my bucket list day.

20:13.851 --> 20:15.984
- Was it enough?
- It was perfect.

20:15.986 --> 20:17.786
Though the fact that
there are endless ways

20:17.788 --> 20:20.155
humans will tempt death
for their own amusement

20:20.157 --> 20:22.257
- never ceases to amaze me.
- Oh, don't worry.

20:22.259 --> 20:24.893
You'll be a stupid human soon.

20:24.895 --> 20:26.662
If that's what you still want.

20:26.664 --> 20:27.996
Yeah, of course it is.

20:27.998 --> 20:29.765
- Do you not believe me?
- I don't know.

20:29.767 --> 20:32.200
Up until recently, your
existence as a vampire never

20:32.202 --> 20:33.769
included anything good.

20:33.771 --> 20:35.871
Maybe you need more time
to live your vampire life

20:35.873 --> 20:37.072
to its fullest.

20:37.074 --> 20:38.473
Nothing I could do as a vampire

20:38.475 --> 20:40.208
would be better than being with you

20:40.210 --> 20:41.610
as a human.

20:41.612 --> 20:43.278
You do not have to do this for me.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.513
I'm aware of that.

20:44.515 --> 20:46.248
But fate has led us here,

20:46.250 --> 20:48.884
and there's nothing left to stop us.

20:48.886 --> 20:51.853
Not a doubt remains in my mind.

20:51.855 --> 20:54.256
In fact, why not just get on with it?

20:54.258 --> 20:56.038
What do you mean?

20:56.063 --> 20:59.227
I mean that as soon as we put
that bloody bell into a suitable

20:59.229 --> 21:01.863
indoor hiding place, let's you
and me grab an empty syringe,

21:01.865 --> 21:05.701
and head straight for
Elena's warehouse in Brooklyn.

21:05.703 --> 21:08.637
About that...

21:21.525 --> 21:23.792
Plan "B" didn't work.
We need a plan "C"

21:23.817 --> 21:25.177
What was wrong with plan "B"?

21:25.202 --> 21:27.289
Well, apparently the
devil can't be killed.

21:27.291 --> 21:28.790
At least not if you rip his heart out.

21:28.792 --> 21:30.659
Or set him on fire.

21:30.661 --> 21:31.793
I thought you said you weren't gonna

21:31.795 --> 21:33.095
try anything stupid.

21:33.097 --> 21:34.496
When did I ever promise that?

21:34.498 --> 21:35.731
Listen, in my defense,

21:35.733 --> 21:37.265
he did both of those things to himself.

21:37.267 --> 21:38.767
Bastard's tougher than he looks.

21:38.769 --> 21:41.570
Guess after 4,000 years,
he's learned a trick or two.

21:41.572 --> 21:43.105
He's immortal.

21:43.107 --> 21:45.140
- Mm-hmm.
- He cannot be killed.

21:45.142 --> 21:49.745
So... we just need to
change the equation.

21:49.747 --> 21:51.413
How?

21:52.583 --> 21:54.583
There's one thing

21:54.585 --> 21:58.387
that can turn immortals mortal.

22:01.959 --> 22:04.459
No. No, no, no, no.

22:04.461 --> 22:05.861
The cure is off the table.

22:05.863 --> 22:07.095
I'm not risking my future

22:07.097 --> 22:09.264
- with Elena.
- What is the bigger risk...

22:09.266 --> 22:12.267
Making the devil mortal
so that we can kill him,

22:12.269 --> 22:13.869
or letting him stay immortal,

22:13.871 --> 22:16.038
and just waiting for him to kill us?

22:16.040 --> 22:18.707
Look, all we need to
do is capture Cade...

22:18.709 --> 22:20.208
You're talking about the devil here.

22:20.210 --> 22:22.611
We give him the cure, he becomes mortal.

22:22.613 --> 22:24.312
Then someone else will take his blood.

22:24.314 --> 22:26.081
That'll make him age 4,000 years

22:26.083 --> 22:27.398
and then shrivel into dust.

22:27.423 --> 22:29.496
You realize if you take the
cure out of Elena's body,

22:29.520 --> 22:32.020
that little vial is
our one and only dose.

22:32.022 --> 22:33.955
And we're not even
sure it'll work on Cade.

22:33.957 --> 22:36.491
This is our best chance
to get Stefan back.

22:36.493 --> 22:38.114
Isn't that what you want?

22:38.139 --> 22:40.562
No, it's what you want.
You know what I want?

22:40.564 --> 22:41.697
I want to fix my brother,

22:41.699 --> 22:43.031
I want to get rid of the devil,

22:43.033 --> 22:44.599
and I want my future with Elena.

22:44.601 --> 22:46.034
But I am not becoming human

22:46.036 --> 22:48.003
while she sleeps for decades.

22:48.005 --> 22:49.504
You won't have to take
the cure right away.

22:49.506 --> 22:51.673
Enzo will take it from
Cade, and years from now,

22:51.675 --> 22:54.042
- you can take it from Enzo.
- Enzo?

22:54.044 --> 22:56.745
Enzo? What...

22:56.747 --> 22:59.681
Bonnie asked him. He said yes.

22:59.683 --> 23:01.049
They were going to tell you.

23:01.051 --> 23:03.385
Before or after they stole it from me?

23:03.387 --> 23:04.953
It doesn't belong to you.

23:04.955 --> 23:06.588
It is in Elena's blood.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.056
She would want to save all of us,

23:08.058 --> 23:10.292
and you know it.

23:10.294 --> 23:12.661
Anyway, I've done the math.

23:12.663 --> 23:14.196
It can work.

23:14.198 --> 23:16.264
How can you be so sure?

23:16.266 --> 23:19.000
It's not about being sure.

23:19.002 --> 23:22.437
It's about using what we've got.

23:22.439 --> 23:24.673
Unless you have a plan "D".

23:24.675 --> 23:28.310
No, I don't.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.668
Bonnie's not gonna like this.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.419
Just hear me out, okay?
Cade as an immortal,

23:42.421 --> 23:43.987
disturbingly indestructible.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.097
Cade as a mortal, total question mark.

23:46.122 --> 23:47.657
Therefore, if we give Cade the cure,

23:47.659 --> 23:49.325
thus turning him mortal,

23:49.327 --> 23:51.327
it might be the only shot
that we have to get rid of him.

23:51.329 --> 23:53.277
"Might be" isn't very convincing.

23:53.302 --> 23:56.399
If you have better ideas about
how to defeat the devil, Bonnie,

23:56.401 --> 23:57.467
I'm all ears.

23:57.469 --> 23:59.369
I finally have Enzo,

23:59.371 --> 24:00.670
minus all the insanity.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.305
We're gonna start a life together.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.506
We need the cure to do that,

24:03.508 --> 24:04.841
and we know it'll work on him

24:04.843 --> 24:06.376
exactly as intended, no question marks.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.711
Besides, what if you're wrong?

24:07.713 --> 24:09.112
Then I lose everything, too.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.313
But there's more at stake here

24:10.315 --> 24:12.048
than just you or me or Enzo.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.819
You understand what
you're asking me to do?

24:13.844 --> 24:14.984
Well, at least I'm asking.

24:14.986 --> 24:18.088
You were just gonna give Enzo
the cure without telling me.

24:18.090 --> 24:21.591
Sorry, I just wanted
to put myself first,

24:21.593 --> 24:23.059
for once.

24:23.061 --> 24:24.394
I just wanted to be happy.

24:24.396 --> 24:27.664
You know what I want
us to both be? Alive.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.765
But we're all out of options.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.300
There has to be a loophole.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.868
This is the loophole.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.103
I hate it, too, Bonnie.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.904
I hate that this is all my fault,

24:34.906 --> 24:37.574
but I got us into this mess,
and I'm gonna get us out.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.375
You still with me, Bon?

24:45.315 --> 24:46.681
Yeah.

24:46.706 --> 24:48.485
Is that a "Yes, I'm with you.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.120
We'll take down Cade together"?

24:50.122 --> 24:51.588
I said yes, okay?

24:51.590 --> 24:52.647
We'll do it.

24:52.672 --> 24:54.090
We'll rescue everyone but ourselves,

24:54.092 --> 24:55.220
again!

25:07.539 --> 25:09.739
Find any secret messages?

25:09.741 --> 25:11.841
Uh, kind of.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.574
There's different styles of handwriting,

25:13.599 --> 25:15.345
which indicates some
sort of back and forth

25:15.347 --> 25:17.814
between two people, likely in secret.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.482
The messages are meaningless.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.985
"Today was a cold day.
The crops are bountiful."

25:21.987 --> 25:24.888
It's like there's a
code inside the code.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.157
Well, if anyone can figure it out,

25:27.159 --> 25:28.491
my money's on you.

25:31.062 --> 25:32.595
And, um,

25:32.597 --> 25:34.397
in case you want to take me up

25:34.399 --> 25:36.232
on my prior offer.

25:36.234 --> 25:38.935
This come with a special ingredient?

25:38.937 --> 25:42.372
Lime juice hides the taste. Huh.

25:42.374 --> 25:46.643
It is an intriguing insurance plan.

25:48.462 --> 25:50.724
You are surprisingly low-key

25:50.749 --> 25:52.715
about the existence of the supernatural.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.551
Are you kidding me? I'm getting a degree

25:54.553 --> 25:56.085
in occult studies here.

25:56.087 --> 25:57.320
I live for this stuff.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.855
Yeah, but how does one even pick that

25:58.857 --> 26:00.243
as a major?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.260
Kind of because of my family.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.301
For generations, we
thought we were cursed.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.970
Bankruptcy, depression,
health problems...

26:13.972 --> 26:17.006
You name it, we dealt with it.

26:17.008 --> 26:19.976
My parents were the
first to break the mold.

26:19.978 --> 26:21.711
Great marriage, successful careers,

26:21.713 --> 26:23.780
two good kids.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.152
And then my, um...

26:29.154 --> 26:31.988
my dad and my little
sister died in a house fire.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.958
It was like we were
cursed all over again.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.528
God, I'm... so sorry.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.279
I hid at the library to cope.

26:41.304 --> 26:43.399
I just wanted to find some sort of proof

26:43.401 --> 26:45.001
that they were at peace.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.871
And then one day I had
the strangest dream.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.205
I was playing baseball,

26:49.207 --> 26:51.608
center field, like I did in high school.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.909
My sister was in the stands.

26:52.911 --> 26:55.211
She was wearing this
ugly Christmas sweater

26:55.213 --> 26:57.614
I always teased her about.

26:57.616 --> 27:01.684
She smiled, and she waved at me.

27:01.709 --> 27:07.674
And I knew it was somehow okay.

27:07.699 --> 27:09.158
And then, of course, I wanted to know

27:09.160 --> 27:10.326
what it all meant.

27:10.328 --> 27:11.794
You know, how was it possible

27:11.796 --> 27:14.030
I felt her spirit?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.266
What other supernatural
or mystical forces

27:16.268 --> 27:18.134
there were in the world.

27:18.136 --> 27:21.329
- Hence, occult studies.
- Um,

27:21.354 --> 27:23.573
have any advice on how
to deal with the devil?

27:23.575 --> 27:26.309
Well, make sure he stays in hell
would be a good place to start.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.482
Stay where you are!

27:35.904 --> 27:37.720
He was stealing from his employees.

27:37.722 --> 27:39.622
The other one was a philanderer.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.724
Arcadius.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.326
Nobody else has to die.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.228
I beg to differ.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.663
Here's another thief.

28:00.045 --> 28:03.179
Stop!

28:03.181 --> 28:06.482
Those of you who feel
yourselves to be good people,

28:06.484 --> 28:07.951
free of evildoing,

28:07.953 --> 28:09.719
you may be excused.

28:09.721 --> 28:11.387
Everyone come with me.

28:23.668 --> 28:27.036
Where's my reluctant envoy?

28:31.148 --> 28:33.910
You said I had until sundown...

28:33.912 --> 28:35.210
micromanager.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.413
You should be thanking me.

28:37.415 --> 28:39.215
I'm doing your work for you.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.050
I assumed your choice was the hundred.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.852
Unless I'm wrong.

28:42.854 --> 28:44.554
You can end this here and now

28:44.556 --> 28:46.923
with one particular soul.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.226
Why do you want me dead?

28:50.228 --> 28:52.295
Have I offended you somehow?

28:52.297 --> 28:56.299
No, but you're important
because you're Stefan's girl.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.234
Your brother understood
the choice right away.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.635
It's not up to Stefan.

28:59.637 --> 29:00.937
Your choice was not.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.472
His choice was.

29:02.474 --> 29:05.174
What do you mean, "his" choice?

29:05.176 --> 29:06.776
The task I gave both of you

29:06.778 --> 29:08.811
was kill 100 people,

29:08.813 --> 29:11.180
or kill your brother's girl.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.348
Stefan chose option "B",

29:12.350 --> 29:14.779
which is to kill your girl.

29:15.782 --> 29:18.688
- Stefan would never hurt Elena.
- You underestimate him.

29:18.690 --> 29:21.190
Stefan headed to New York
without blinking an eye.

29:21.192 --> 29:24.560
He jumped at the chance to murder Elena.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.568
Okay...

29:32.570 --> 29:34.570
fine.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.277
Oh, my God.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.223
- Happy?
- Yes,

29:54.225 --> 29:56.592
and no.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.827
She doesn't count.

29:57.829 --> 29:59.128
She was essentially a good woman,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.264
and her soul is of no use to me.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.266
But I quite enjoyed watching you work.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.668
I gave you three worthy kills.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.770
You still have 97 to go.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.739
And then you send Stefan home?

30:09.741 --> 30:11.874
Oh, you misunderstand me.

30:11.876 --> 30:14.544
Your quota is separate
from your brother's task.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.480
You made your choice, he made his.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.850
No. No, no, no.

30:20.852 --> 30:23.886
No, no, no. I'll do anything you want...

30:23.888 --> 30:27.090
- You stop him!
- The time for bargains is over.

30:27.092 --> 30:30.927
Now get back to work.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.653
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- Sorry, Blondie.

30:41.655 --> 30:44.723
You'll only slow me down
if I have to hurt him.

30:58.539 --> 31:00.639
You know, it is so refreshing to know

31:00.641 --> 31:02.608
that whatever you say
will not bother me.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.276
Then why even answer my call?

31:04.278 --> 31:06.345
Same reason people channel
surf when they're bored.

31:06.347 --> 31:08.514
Just passing time while my new friend

31:08.516 --> 31:09.715
fills out the paperwork.

31:09.717 --> 31:10.949
Wait, you're doing paperwork?

31:10.951 --> 31:11.816
Yep.

31:11.841 --> 31:13.252
She had everything messengered over

31:13.254 --> 31:14.586
from the county clerk's office,

31:14.588 --> 31:16.422
and I will be on my way as soon

31:16.424 --> 31:18.490
as she signs on the last dotted line.

31:18.492 --> 31:20.325
- What are you talking about?
- Uh-uh-uh...

31:20.327 --> 31:21.660
You have to notarize that page.

31:21.662 --> 31:22.951
Where's your stamp?

31:29.259 --> 31:32.150
So, Elena's here?

31:32.152 --> 31:35.086
She's the reason you bought this house.

31:35.088 --> 31:36.254
I had her moved

31:36.256 --> 31:37.555
from the Brooklyn warehouse

31:37.557 --> 31:38.923
after you and Damon went missing...

31:38.925 --> 31:40.364
for her safety.

31:41.128 --> 31:42.927
Heard your chat with Damon.

31:42.929 --> 31:46.064
He's right.

31:46.066 --> 31:48.266
It's not the time to be selfish.

31:48.268 --> 31:51.369
Defeating Cade is more important.

31:52.873 --> 31:55.540
We're so close to everything we wanted.

31:56.061 --> 31:57.994
It's right here...

32:00.047 --> 32:02.747
...and we can't have it.

32:05.252 --> 32:07.686
Come here, luv.

32:15.896 --> 32:18.797
I never get to have my chance.

32:18.799 --> 32:21.299
Always give it up.

32:21.301 --> 32:24.369
Always do the right thing...

32:24.371 --> 32:26.204
for everyone else.

32:26.206 --> 32:27.739
Do you want to keep the cure?

32:27.741 --> 32:31.976
No. No, I want to help.

32:31.978 --> 32:34.245
I want to use it on Cade.

32:34.247 --> 32:36.331
It just sucks.

32:36.356 --> 32:39.317
Your selflessness is part
of what makes you you.

32:39.319 --> 32:43.321
And I will be by your side
no matter what happens.

32:43.323 --> 32:45.523
I'm sorry I built up this whole future

32:45.525 --> 32:47.592
that we might not get to see.

32:47.594 --> 32:51.563
Bonnie... I'll still be in love with you

32:51.565 --> 32:52.964
even if I stay a vampire.

32:52.966 --> 32:55.400
We can still have our future.

32:55.402 --> 32:58.136
We can live right here in this house.

32:58.138 --> 33:01.573
We can cook dinner every
night in the kitchen.

33:01.575 --> 33:02.574
Dance by the fire.

33:02.576 --> 33:03.875
I'll play the guitar.

33:08.115 --> 33:09.914
And I'll watch you grow old and gray.

33:09.916 --> 33:11.216
Oh.

33:11.218 --> 33:13.443
And you'll be as beautiful then...

33:15.188 --> 33:17.222
...as you are now.

33:17.224 --> 33:19.924
I don't need the cure to be happy.

33:21.595 --> 33:24.629
I only need you.

33:30.871 --> 33:32.203
Congratulations.

33:32.205 --> 33:34.472
You are about to become a proud owner

33:34.474 --> 33:36.441
of Bonnie Bennett's safe house.

33:42.015 --> 33:45.650
Now, let's go try and save the world.

33:53.427 --> 33:55.260
Enzo!

33:58.732 --> 34:00.398
One more thing.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.403
Will you do me a favor and invite me in?

34:13.275 --> 34:15.810
I just sent the last guy home...

34:15.812 --> 34:17.768
after compelling him to forget

34:17.793 --> 34:19.260
today's not-so-happy hour.

34:19.284 --> 34:20.781
Great. Now we can all pretend

34:20.783 --> 34:22.449
like this day never happened...

34:22.452 --> 34:24.819
except for the people who are dead.

34:24.821 --> 34:27.955
You know what?

34:27.956 --> 34:31.125
I have had a crappy couple of days.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.594
I don't need you shoving
your judgment in my face.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.629
I'm just being honest.

34:35.630 --> 34:37.630
Okay? I'm hanging on by a thread.

34:37.632 --> 34:39.734
This whole town's
hanging on by a thread.

34:39.735 --> 34:41.393
This isn't the town
we grew up in anymore.

34:41.418 --> 34:44.405
It's exactly the same
as it was back then.

34:44.407 --> 34:47.926
We just didn't know any
better because we were kids,

34:47.951 --> 34:50.451
playing games and burying old photos.

34:50.476 --> 34:54.489
Adults hid the darkness from us, Matt.

34:55.309 --> 34:57.977
We're the adults now.

34:57.979 --> 35:00.112
And you're part of the darkness.

35:00.114 --> 35:01.981
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, well, tell that

35:01.983 --> 35:04.383
to the corpses you just
compelled everyone to forget.

35:15.477 --> 35:17.429
That's not spiked with blood, is it?

35:17.431 --> 35:18.664
No, no.

35:18.666 --> 35:20.132
I'm not about that life,

35:20.134 --> 35:21.767
not after what I saw today.

35:21.769 --> 35:23.469
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

35:23.471 --> 35:26.305
No, don't be. I chose to be here.

35:30.745 --> 35:31.844
Huh.

35:31.846 --> 35:34.179
Weird. This last message

35:34.181 --> 35:35.748
is in a completely different language.

35:35.750 --> 35:36.749
What's it say?

35:36.751 --> 35:38.284
I have no clue.

35:38.286 --> 35:40.336
It's kind of like Latin,

35:40.361 --> 35:44.857
also kind of Gothic...
maybe some old Prussian.

35:44.859 --> 35:46.425
You know what? I have to check this,

35:46.427 --> 35:47.693
and get some stuff from the library.

35:47.695 --> 35:49.061
Um...

35:49.063 --> 35:50.696
oh, I almost forgot.

35:50.698 --> 35:53.732
I was geeking out with the
historical society today,

35:53.734 --> 35:56.235
and, uh, they found another
Maxwell heirloom in the capsule.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.003
You should have it.

36:02.086 --> 36:04.620
I'll text you when I
get back to the Armory.

36:04.645 --> 36:07.212
You're going back to
work? Do you ever sleep?

36:07.214 --> 36:08.948
I'll sleep when I'm dead,

36:08.950 --> 36:12.184
which will eventually
happen because I'm human.

36:12.186 --> 36:14.820
I intend to stay that
way if I can help it.

36:23.197 --> 36:25.764
Now, unless you're in a hovercraft,

36:25.766 --> 36:27.099
you're not gonna catch me in time.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.667
Donovan called in some favors.

36:28.669 --> 36:30.336
NYPD's headed to the
warehouse right now.

36:30.338 --> 36:31.937
Well, I'm not on my way to Brooklyn.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.639
Elena is in upstate New York.

36:34.481 --> 36:35.574
What...

36:35.576 --> 36:37.710
how is that even possible?

36:37.712 --> 36:39.244
That's where Bonnie hid her.

36:39.246 --> 36:40.646
Where Bonnie hid her?

36:40.648 --> 36:42.214
How would you even know that?

36:42.216 --> 36:44.350
Damon, we work for a
psychic. Did you forget?

36:44.352 --> 36:46.950
Cade told me he met Bonnie
this morning at a coffee shop

36:46.975 --> 36:47.953
and read her mind.

36:47.955 --> 36:50.389
That's where he saw the
address of the safe house.

36:50.391 --> 36:52.758
It wasn't too difficult
to track down her realtor.

36:52.760 --> 36:56.762
Although, that title deed
paperwork did take forever.

36:56.764 --> 36:58.530
Come inside.

36:58.532 --> 37:00.666
I invite you in.

37:03.270 --> 37:05.537
It's no use, luv.

37:05.539 --> 37:07.239
Look, we need to get the cure and go.

37:07.241 --> 37:08.173
Can you manage?

37:08.175 --> 37:09.328
I'll try.

37:14.348 --> 37:16.181
Stefan...

37:16.183 --> 37:17.850
- listen to me.
- Let me guess.

37:17.852 --> 37:19.485
You're gonna appeal to my humanity

37:19.487 --> 37:21.387
and my brotherly bond.

37:21.389 --> 37:23.489
"Think about Elena."
Blah, blah, blah.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.823
You don't have to think about anything,

37:24.825 --> 37:26.025
just turn around.

37:26.027 --> 37:27.326
I'll meet you wherever you want.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.561
Yeah? And then what?

37:29.563 --> 37:31.830
Then, whatever anger
you're working through, man,

37:31.832 --> 37:33.866
you can just take it out on me.

37:33.868 --> 37:35.000
I am taking it out on you.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.669
I'm on my way to murder Elena.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.936
Stefan.

37:37.938 --> 37:39.038
In fact, Waze says

37:39.040 --> 37:40.305
I'll be there in five minutes.

37:58.959 --> 38:01.293
You don't have to do this for Cade.

38:01.295 --> 38:02.528
I'm not doing this for Cade.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.529
I'm doing this for me.

38:03.554 --> 38:04.338
What?!

38:04.363 --> 38:06.699
When Cade first suggested
this idea, I was like,

38:06.701 --> 38:08.400
"God, why didn't I think of that"?

38:08.402 --> 38:09.902
Oh, I know why. Because
I've been too busy

38:09.904 --> 38:11.537
taking care of my brother.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.306
You don't have to take
care of me... ever again.

38:14.308 --> 38:15.974
I got this. I'm good.

38:15.976 --> 38:18.944
I'll take care of both of us, Stefan.

38:18.946 --> 38:21.213
No, you won't, Damon.
You're not capable of it,

38:21.215 --> 38:23.549
but you'll keep trying to
interfere with everything

38:23.551 --> 38:25.384
as long as we're connected through her.

38:25.386 --> 38:28.220
That is why I want Elena gone.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.889
I swear to God, Stefan,
if you hurt her...

38:30.891 --> 38:32.524
you are dead to me.

38:32.526 --> 38:34.393
That's exactly my point.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.861
I want to cause her death
so you can blame me for it...

38:36.886 --> 38:41.033
because then you will finally
stop trying to save me...

38:41.035 --> 38:43.736
and I will be free of you forever.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.370
This is not the answer, man.

38:45.372 --> 38:46.739
Leave Elena out of this.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.307
I am begging you, Stefan.

38:48.309 --> 38:50.375
Listen to yourself. You are pathetic.

38:50.377 --> 38:53.579
She's the root of all your
problems, and therefore, mine.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.347
I mean, she's still coming between us,

38:55.349 --> 38:57.587
which is insane if you
really think about it

38:57.612 --> 39:00.119
because, to be honest with you,
in the grand scheme of things,

39:00.121 --> 39:01.420
she's really not that special.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.656
She's just a stupid girl.

39:04.658 --> 39:08.927
She's a stupid human girl
who will be so easy to kill.

39:08.929 --> 39:09.995
Stefan.

39:09.997 --> 39:12.131
She's already in her coffin,
prepped and ready to go.

39:12.133 --> 39:13.565
I'm thinking something symbolic.

39:13.567 --> 39:16.135
Maybe find a bathtub to drown her in.

39:16.137 --> 39:17.836
Full circle kind of thing.

39:17.838 --> 39:21.140
You can't do that. You won't.

39:21.142 --> 39:24.009
Oh, yes, I can and I will...

39:24.011 --> 39:25.944
and I can't wait.

39:25.946 --> 39:26.979
Stefan.

39:26.981 --> 39:29.815
Stefan!

39:39.727 --> 39:41.026
You all right in there?

39:41.028 --> 39:42.094
Yeah.

39:42.096 --> 39:43.529
It just feels so weird

39:43.531 --> 39:45.297
to be doing this to her.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.399
I'm not exactly an
expert at drawing blood.

39:47.401 --> 39:48.734
Nonsense.

39:48.736 --> 39:50.803
I'm sure you're brilliant at it.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.615
How much blood should I take?

39:52.640 --> 39:55.141
Does the cure have a minimum dosage?

40:05.932 --> 40:08.032
Do you think this is enough?

40:09.990 --> 40:12.124
Enzo?

40:32.165 --> 40:33.545
Really?

40:36.055 --> 40:37.883
Let go of me.

40:37.885 --> 40:40.729
What do you care what
happens to Elena, huh?

40:40.754 --> 40:43.488
In a minute, you're
gonna be dead, anyway.

40:45.492 --> 40:47.526
And you're gonna be human.

41:18.459 --> 41:20.692
Enzo!
