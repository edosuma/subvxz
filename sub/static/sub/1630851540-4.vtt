00:07.583 --> 00:08.875
Help!

00:08.958 --> 00:10.416
Help! There's a tiger!

00:11.083 --> 00:12.166
He's so cute.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.291
-Come here.
-Help!

00:14.375 --> 00:15.500
-Help!
-Come on.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.500
Joseph, stop. You're gonna wind him up.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.416
-He looks like a stuffed toy.
-Son, stop it. Jo!

00:21.500 --> 00:22.916
-Please hurry!
-Come here.

00:23.583 --> 00:24.833
Let go of me.

00:24.916 --> 00:26.083
Hold on.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.458
Don't move!

00:41.583 --> 00:44.375
No!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.583
Dad, are you all right?

00:50.666 --> 00:52.375
Dad, can you hear me?

00:53.916 --> 00:55.000
Are you asleep?

00:59.416 --> 01:01.750
-Yeah.
-What came over you? Why did you do that?

01:02.541 --> 01:04.875
I thought you were gonna take the dart.

01:07.041 --> 01:09.291
I misjudged the trajectory.

01:10.833 --> 01:13.125
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:20.750 --> 01:23.958
Thank you for contacting me
about the message from the Hazans.

01:24.041 --> 01:25.750
So tell me everything.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.750
I can't decide
between the gnaouia and the pkaila.

01:28.833 --> 01:31.625
Get both. It's on me. So this message?

01:32.250 --> 01:34.041
-David, please.
-Coming.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.833
So I'll have a gnaouia,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.375
a pkaila, the full sole,

01:39.458 --> 01:43.041
loubia and couscous, nikitouche, chorba,

01:43.125 --> 01:45.041
and boukha for everyone.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.375
-Noted, Mr. Gaston.
-Thank you.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.416
Great. So this message?

01:49.500 --> 01:50.708
Yes, right.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.875
Well, I got this.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.291
And I'm sure it's from Gérard,

01:55.375 --> 01:58.250
because I recognized
his old-man handwriting.

01:58.833 --> 02:01.333
In Colombia. Okay. Thank you. I gotta go.

02:01.958 --> 02:03.583
Hold on. Where are you going?

02:03.666 --> 02:05.625
Sorry, but I need to warn the authorities.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.375
Now we can save them. Thanks.

02:07.458 --> 02:09.458
-Hold on.
-What?

02:10.166 --> 02:11.375
Lunch was on you.

02:13.416 --> 02:15.208
It's all right. I'll pay.

02:15.291 --> 02:16.250
Yeah.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.833
Gérard, can you hear me?

02:23.583 --> 02:24.583
Gérard?

02:25.333 --> 02:27.458
That falafel was strong.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.791
It still gives you a headache though.
Fuck.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.333
That son of a bitch is gonna sell my kids.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.375
Stop it.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.958
We'll explain. The mushrooms work.

02:39.041 --> 02:41.666
We'll offer to grow another batch.
That's all.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.000
-Aure?
-Enough, Olive. Don't talk to me.

02:44.083 --> 02:46.041
Gérard, can you hear me? Wake up.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.541
Catherine, no. I think you need
to stop slapping him.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.958
I feel like it turns him on.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.833
Yes, sorry. I didn't notice.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.375
Maybe it's better you didn't.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.458
He must really love you, Catherine.

02:57.541 --> 02:59.791
He wouldn't have jumped in front of us.

03:05.791 --> 03:07.000
Léonard!

03:07.083 --> 03:08.458
Perfect timing.

03:08.541 --> 03:11.125
We were just talking about the falafel--

03:11.208 --> 03:14.000
-Shut your trap, bitch.
-All right.

03:14.083 --> 03:18.291
I don't give a fuck about your falafel.
We're stopping. You're a bunch of pests.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.166
No, hold on. It was an accident.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.958
-The shrooms worked really well.
-They were super. I swear.

03:23.041 --> 03:25.166
So everything burned down
just by coincidence!

03:25.250 --> 03:27.291
Yeah, total coincidence.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.166
I'm not a retard.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.000
You can't do shit.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.416
You're assholes.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.250
You almost got the tiger killed.

03:34.333 --> 03:35.958
What should I do? Not say anything?

03:36.041 --> 03:37.250
-Stay like this?
-No.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.541
Too bad. This man's kids will pay.
I'm going back to the Ibrahim plan.

03:40.625 --> 03:42.333
-No!
-Yes.

03:42.416 --> 03:45.083
Don't touch my kids, please.
Damn it, Léonard.

03:45.166 --> 03:48.791
We're okay with you taking our organs.
All right? But don't touch my kids.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.000
Why are you talking about organs?

03:56.458 --> 03:58.500
I don't know why I'm talking about organs.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.583
I mean, I do know why.

04:00.666 --> 04:03.000
'Cause I know they're worth some money.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.916
Everyone knows that. That's all.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.833
Remember, Olive.
I searched for "kidneys" online once.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.083
And what did it say?

04:11.166 --> 04:13.291
It said 120,000 euros. All right?

04:13.375 --> 04:14.833
120K for a kidney.

04:14.916 --> 04:18.291
Damn! Kidneys are
a great financial opportunity!

04:18.375 --> 04:19.500
I wasn't aware.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.041
It was in the back of my mind.
That's why I'm talking about it.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.958
Do the math, Léonard. It's really simple.

04:25.041 --> 04:27.833
If you harvest all our organs,
it'll be a lot more profitable

04:27.916 --> 04:29.333
than my three shitty babies.

04:29.416 --> 04:31.625
All right, Jo. Stop talking nonsense.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.416
There's no need to do that.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.708
-For example, we can restart production.
-No more falafel.

04:36.791 --> 04:39.000
-It's over.
-No, Léonard. Don't listen to her.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.500
Léonard, listen to me, please.

04:40.583 --> 04:43.958
Harvest our organs
and forget about my kids.

04:44.041 --> 04:47.208
And in turn, you'll earn a ton of money.

04:47.708 --> 04:49.458
What I'm proposing is a win-win.

04:49.541 --> 04:52.291
Really. On top of that, on the other end,

04:52.375 --> 04:55.791
some poor guy's gonna end up
with a brand-new kidney,

04:55.875 --> 04:57.958
all perfect and shiny.
He'll write a check.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.250
He'll be there
with his kidney like, "Damn,

05:00.333 --> 05:02.333
I almost spent
120,000 euros on a Bentley."

05:02.416 --> 05:05.083
"Thank God I didn't."

05:05.166 --> 05:08.000
"My piss will finally be yellow, damn it."

05:08.083 --> 05:11.041
"My piss will finally be yellow!"
'Cause he used to piss blood.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.708
Also, for us Jews, it's a mitzvah,

05:13.791 --> 05:15.791
which is a really good deed.

05:15.875 --> 05:19.291
Let me tell you, up in heaven,
it won't go unnoticed for the books.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.166
So it's a win-win-win,

05:23.250 --> 05:25.000
with the poor guy.

05:25.083 --> 05:26.291
A win-win-win.

05:27.791 --> 05:31.500
There's no win-win-win. It's lose-lose.
Your plan is an amateur trick.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.000
-You come with me.
-No!

05:34.375 --> 05:35.958
-Let go!
-Where are you taking her?

05:36.916 --> 05:39.291
-Where are you taking her?
-Stop it! No!

05:40.666 --> 05:42.000
What are you doing?

05:44.791 --> 05:47.958
All right. Let go of me.
You're really hurting me. Let go.

05:48.041 --> 05:51.166
Why did you mention harvesting organs?
Can't you hold your tongue?

05:51.250 --> 05:52.833
I didn't. I don't know how they know.

05:52.916 --> 05:55.166
Yeah, right. My ass. Stop saying bullshit.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.041
It's simple. I'm cutting my losses.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.958
I'll beat those idiots down one by one
and sell their detached parts.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.375
Stop your nonsense.
Did you know their mushrooms work?

06:03.500 --> 06:04.541
-Really?
-Yes.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.083
What will we do without them?

06:06.166 --> 06:08.375
Well, we have their recipe now.
We don't need them.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.041
We can kill them whenever,
no complications.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.791
Did you forget about Guzman?

06:12.875 --> 06:16.375
Two months ago
you were shitting right in his face,

06:16.458 --> 06:17.791
and now you're scared?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.750
Let me remind you we have a deal with him.
We return them alive.

06:20.833 --> 06:23.583
Come on.
I noticed a while back you're weak.

06:23.666 --> 06:25.000
Since Dad died…

06:25.083 --> 06:27.541
You were a lioness,
but you've become a scalded cat.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.958
You little idiot. Enough of your bullshit.
You're not killing anyone.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.791
I'm the boss around here.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.083
No. Those were the good old days.
That's over now.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.291
No!

06:41.541 --> 06:43.291
No! Stop it!

06:44.041 --> 06:45.250
Sorry, Mom.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.291
No! Léonard!

06:48.166 --> 06:49.333
Léonard, stop this!

06:53.791 --> 06:54.833
Okay.

06:55.666 --> 06:56.791
All right.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.000
Thank you. Goodbye.

07:01.625 --> 07:02.458
All good.

07:02.541 --> 07:05.541
The Colombian special forces
are gonna launch a rescue operation.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.000
They'll be saved within 24 hours.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.625
There you go!

07:08.708 --> 07:11.333
That's my sister! Who's that?

07:11.416 --> 07:13.916
My sister! Give me a kiss.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.375
That's good!

07:16.333 --> 07:18.833
What the fuck did you do,
you big fat bitch?

07:18.916 --> 07:21.083
Sorry. I'm so happy
that I have to break stuff!

07:21.166 --> 07:23.250
You can break stuff at your place later.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.000
That's a great idea! I could break my TV.

07:27.916 --> 07:31.000
So, Youssef, does this mean
we can abandon our infiltration mission?

07:31.708 --> 07:32.625
No.

07:32.708 --> 07:34.000
Your what?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.250
What infiltration mission?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.208
What the hell, Youssef?

07:41.291 --> 07:43.375
Yeah. What the hell
is this infiltration mission?

07:43.458 --> 07:45.541
Were you planning something
behind our backs?

07:46.041 --> 07:48.375
I'm not an idiot. What is this?

07:58.583 --> 07:59.583
Léonard?

08:17.666 --> 08:18.708
Everyone.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.000
You know Dr. Cliff.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.458
Well, there you go.

08:25.541 --> 08:28.708
You agree. That's great.
Organs are better than my kids.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.708
I have stuff to discuss
with my Russian buyers.

08:32.791 --> 08:33.791
You handle this.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.458
If there's any issue, my guards are here.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.375
See you tomorrow.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.708
-Who should I start with? I need two.
-Me.

08:40.791 --> 08:42.375
-I'm in.
-I'm not.

08:42.458 --> 08:43.458
I'm not going.

08:43.541 --> 08:46.083
Yes, you have to, guys.
It seems like it's great.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.250
When you have a kidney or a lung removed,

08:48.333 --> 08:50.416
that's four or five kilos
off the scale. Right, Doctor?

08:50.500 --> 08:51.458
Nein.

08:51.541 --> 08:54.500
All right. Bro, you been wanting
to get fit for a while. This is a bargain.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.791
It's better than eating miso soup all day.

08:57.958 --> 08:59.916
Well, anyway, I'm going. Let's go.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.416
Who else?

09:05.250 --> 09:09.250
He's resting now,
but earlier today he said he was ready.

09:09.333 --> 09:10.875
Olive, are you kidding?

09:15.666 --> 09:18.208
No, I don't agree.
What if the surgery goes wrong?

09:18.916 --> 09:22.291
No, take me. I'm in. I changed my mind.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.208
Too late.

09:25.541 --> 09:26.541
Aure.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.750
Aure, I swear nothing will happen.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.000
They're Krauts.
They know what they're doing.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.458
It's deutsche Qualität.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.666
All right, see you later.

09:47.125 --> 09:48.583
What do you mean, "Herz"?

09:49.125 --> 09:50.041
Dr. Cliff?

09:50.541 --> 09:52.750
Why Hertz? Are you renting a car?

09:52.833 --> 09:54.791
"Herz" means heart.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.583
I know it means heart,
but you're not gonna…

09:57.666 --> 09:59.166
You're not taking his heart, are you?

10:01.166 --> 10:04.000
My father can't live without his heart!

10:04.083 --> 10:07.166
Check your order form.
There must be a mistake.

10:07.250 --> 10:09.625
You're mistaken.
That's not what we agreed on.

10:09.708 --> 10:12.208
Stop touching him, damn it!

10:12.291 --> 10:15.041
You hear me? Don't take his heart,
damn it! Don't touch him!

10:15.125 --> 10:18.208
Dad, wake up, for fuck's sake!

10:18.291 --> 10:20.625
This is the last time you'll ever see him.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.583
Don't you want to say goodbye instead?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.666
You're gonna kill my father?

10:40.791 --> 10:42.208
Dad, I'm sorry.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.416
I'm sorry for everything.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.958
I'm sorry I dragged you into this mess.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I'm sorry, damn it. I love you.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.208
I love you, Dad.

11:01.708 --> 11:05.333
I'm sorry I said
Catherine was with you for the money.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.000
It's not true.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.458
We don't give a shit about money.

11:12.791 --> 11:14.250
Money's not important.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.083
Yes, money is important!

11:18.166 --> 11:19.625
Money's important. Dr. Cliff.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.291
Dr. Cliff, please listen to me.

11:21.791 --> 11:25.875
If you help us escape, we'll pay you.
We have a huge amount of money in France.

11:26.666 --> 11:28.250
It's always money with you people.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.458
Wow.

11:29.541 --> 11:31.250
Okay, who are "you people"?

11:32.291 --> 11:34.583
That sounds a little anti-Semitic.

11:34.666 --> 11:36.458
Always playing the victim.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.500
That's clearly anti-Semitic.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.125
Okay, it doesn't matter.
Let's ignore that.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.500
What I'm talking about is money.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.250
You know what money is, don't you?

11:45.333 --> 11:47.250
It matters.
You can buy a lot of stuff with it.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.083
You can buy houses, cars.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.166
-Also…
-All right, I get it.

11:51.833 --> 11:52.791
How much?

11:54.833 --> 11:56.125
A hundred thousand.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.083
Cash. Within an hour.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.750
You're making me laugh.
I'm already earning 120,000.

12:01.833 --> 12:03.583
One hundred and thirty, then.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.291
What? You want 140?

12:05.875 --> 12:08.541
Dr. Cliff, do you want 150?
I'll give you 150!

12:09.208 --> 12:11.375
All right, 500,000! I'll give you 500,000.

12:15.625 --> 12:17.708
500,000 euros is a lot of money.

12:18.833 --> 12:21.375
What would make me think
you were that rich?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.166
We're Jews.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.541
You know, for us Jews, money…

12:34.625 --> 12:37.875
From the moment we wake up,
we spread 200-euro bills on our toast.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.291
And we have all the banks too.

12:40.833 --> 12:43.291
I have two accounts
at la Société Générale.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.833
I do what I want.

12:44.916 --> 12:46.458
That doesn't surprise me.

12:46.541 --> 12:48.291
I don't even pay by card anymore.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.208
I pay with a "Jewish card."

12:50.291 --> 12:53.833
It's a card they give
to every Jew in the world at birth.

12:53.916 --> 12:57.375
And when you turn 18,
you earn miles for going to the synagogue.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.208
That works out well 'cause every Sunday,
we all meet up in New York.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.958
Every Jew in the world.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.500
With the Chinese,

13:04.583 --> 13:06.666
the Dutch, and the Turks.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.000
I knew that. I read it in a blog.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.458
Yeah, it's known.

13:10.541 --> 13:12.250
Even Kim Jong-un comes.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.375
Yeah, Kim Jong-un, the dictator.

13:15.458 --> 13:18.125
Do you think he has a bowl cut?

13:19.375 --> 13:20.416
No.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.833
It's a giant kippah.

13:22.416 --> 13:23.833
I knew it.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.333
I'm still going to verify
this story about money.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.333
What are you injecting us with?

13:44.833 --> 13:45.916
What is that shit?

13:46.958 --> 13:48.041
A serum.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.583
A truth serum.

13:49.666 --> 13:52.791
With all due respect, Dr. Spliff,
truth serum doesn't exist.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.500
He thinks he's in a James Bond movie.

13:55.583 --> 13:56.458
So,

13:57.125 --> 14:00.333
do you really have
500,000 euros hidden in France?

14:00.416 --> 14:03.000
No, not at all.
We don't have 500,000 euros.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.666
Your stuff doesn't work.
He's talking nonsense.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.250
Obviously we have it.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.333
No, we have five million euros.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.000
What are you saying?

14:11.083 --> 14:14.041
He's talking nonsense.
We have exactly five million euros.

14:14.625 --> 14:15.875
Goddamn it!

14:15.958 --> 14:17.291
His stuff works.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.291
Whoa! This serum's effectiveness
is extraordinary.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.083
Five million.

14:22.708 --> 14:24.125
And where is this treasure?

14:24.208 --> 14:27.291
I don't know. I swear on my three kids.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.666
We were in jail when they buried it.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.708
Ask my sister. She knows where it is.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.083
I'm telling him everything!

14:35.791 --> 14:37.833
We said 500,000 though.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.000
Not five million.

14:39.583 --> 14:41.041
The price just went up.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.791
That's crazy.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.000
I told you.
I don't know where that money is.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.791
It's somewhere in the forest.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.250
But the only one who knows is Ali.
He handled that.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.833
Where can I find this Ali?

14:56.041 --> 14:58.958
I don't know.
I don't even know if he's alive.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.416
He must have an address.

15:01.375 --> 15:04.416
Yes, he does,
Olivier's the only one who knows it.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.250
What? That's nonsense.

15:07.791 --> 15:09.458
No, wait! I can't stand shots.

15:09.541 --> 15:13.375
I'll tell you the truth.
Ali lives at 31 rue de la Ferronnerie.

15:17.833 --> 15:18.791
Damn.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.708
Sorry. It was the serum.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.416
So…

15:26.416 --> 15:27.333
That address?

15:28.791 --> 15:30.500
31 rue de la Ferronnerie.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.333
-Well, we just wasted some serum. Great.
-Yeah.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.125
I'm still gonna send someone
to Paris to check.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.416
Damn, you're a real snitch.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.083
You're the snitch.
You told them I knew Ali's address.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.166
I was on the serum, you idiot.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.583
Their stuff works really well.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.375
Tell me, Dad.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.958
Why did you say earlier,

15:58.041 --> 16:00.125
"I swear on my three kids"?

16:01.291 --> 16:03.041
-I said that?
-Yeah, you did.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.500
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.666
You said, "I swear on my three kids."

16:07.458 --> 16:09.291
I was thinking about something else.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.166
Why would I say I had three kids?

16:13.250 --> 16:15.208
Everyone knows I only have three.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.500
I don't get it. How many kids do you have?

16:21.916 --> 16:23.458
What are you saying?

16:25.208 --> 16:26.666
What are you saying?

16:27.791 --> 16:31.000
Joseph, sometimes
it's better not to know everything.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.541
I want to know everything.

16:33.666 --> 16:34.500
Did you cheat on Mom?

16:35.541 --> 16:36.958
Right away with the accusations.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.500
Do you have a secret child?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.375
I had…

16:43.666 --> 16:45.333
Yes, I had an affair. There.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.125
Fuck.

16:49.666 --> 16:50.625
That's disgusting.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.500
Come on.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.208
All right. Calm down.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.916
You were the perfect couple.
I don't know how you could've done that.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.750
Please, Joseph.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.833
Come back down to Earth and grow up.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.125
The perfect couple…

17:04.083 --> 17:06.125
There's no such thing.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.125
No.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.541
Love, sex,

17:09.625 --> 17:11.166
relationships,

17:11.250 --> 17:14.500
that's really complicated.

17:16.791 --> 17:19.083
We lose and find each other again.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.125
Life isn't a Disney movie.

17:23.791 --> 17:26.250
That's a really bad example
you just came up with.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.833
'Cause Disney movies
can be really violent.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.875
-Remember The Lion King?
-Yeah, we saw that together.

17:32.958 --> 17:36.000
Well, remember the scene
with the stampede in the canyon

17:36.083 --> 17:37.750
'cause Scar set them up?

17:38.333 --> 17:40.791
And all the mountain goats
are coming from both sides,

17:40.875 --> 17:42.625
trampling Mufasa's head

17:42.708 --> 17:44.708
as he's trying to save Simba.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.125
Mufasa died.

17:50.625 --> 17:54.083
Disney's not just about "Hakuna Matata."

17:54.166 --> 17:55.541
And I can tell you that after,

17:56.041 --> 17:59.791
Timon and Pumbaa went through hell
to get Simba to smile again.

18:00.625 --> 18:02.166
Come on, your turn.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.541
Okay.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.791
Who was your first, Olive?

18:07.875 --> 18:10.375
No, you can't ask that.
That's not a good question.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.458
Yes, it's a good one.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.541
Stop it!
Why did that asshole have to jab me?

18:13.625 --> 18:16.250
I gave him the right address.
You can't do that. Fuck.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.916
Stop it. No.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.958
So?

18:19.583 --> 18:22.041
It was with…

18:22.958 --> 18:25.833
-With you.
-There you go. I knew it.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.791
You were acting so experienced.

18:30.166 --> 18:32.791
I remember the next day,
I slept with Sarah Sarfati.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.833
-Remember her?
-Are you kidding? She was my girlfriend.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.166
I know. I'm sorry.

18:40.541 --> 18:41.958
What happened to that child?

18:44.625 --> 18:46.708
Have I seen him? Do I know him?

18:49.916 --> 18:50.750
Yes.

18:53.541 --> 18:54.750
You know him.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.291
So it's a boy then.

18:56.375 --> 18:57.750
Stop it now, Joseph.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.875
Don't tell me to stop!
You're hiding a brother from me!

19:00.958 --> 19:02.458
I want to know who it is.

19:03.833 --> 19:04.958
Who is it?

19:10.500 --> 19:11.583
It's Olivier.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.875
Wait. You know, I was kind of in love.

19:15.958 --> 19:18.500
Me too. I was crazy about that girl.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.333
She was awesome. And she was a bombshell.

19:22.000 --> 19:22.833
Remember?

19:24.875 --> 19:26.291
No, I'm talking about you.

19:29.000 --> 19:29.875
Okay.

19:33.458 --> 19:34.625
Yeah.

19:34.708 --> 19:35.625
Yeah.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.250
Olivier's my brother.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.708
But there's still something I don't get.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.208
You've always treated him like shit.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.750
What's wrong with you? Don't you love him?

19:58.708 --> 20:00.333
Of course I love him.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.083
I love Olive very much.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.583
It's just

20:07.791 --> 20:10.291
when I see him,
I can't help but think about his mother.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.750
I can't help but think about my Béné.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.750
I can't help but think
how I did something wrong.

20:17.458 --> 20:18.708
I can attest to that.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.000
That was really shitty of you.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.708
I did everything to keep him in our lives.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.458
Really everything.

20:29.416 --> 20:31.625
Why do you think you're best friends?

20:32.708 --> 20:35.125
I'm the one who sent you
to the same summer camp.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.375
I invited him over every Friday.

20:39.208 --> 20:43.125
I took you to the movies
and bought you the same clothes.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.208
I did all that.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.583
So please…

20:51.791 --> 20:53.125
don't say that to me.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.791
When I tell Olive he's my brother,

21:00.708 --> 21:02.083
he's gonna lose it.

21:03.041 --> 21:05.083
You're not gonna tell him anything at all.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.041
Nothing.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.583
He won't be able to handle it.
He'll hate me.

21:09.666 --> 21:11.000
He'll never forgive me.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.708
Thirty-seven years of lies.

21:13.541 --> 21:14.666
That's a long time.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.041
I don't give a shit.

21:16.958 --> 21:19.083
Don't you think he deserves
to know who his father is

21:19.166 --> 21:20.625
instead of making up bullshit?

21:20.708 --> 21:22.083
Exactly.

21:22.166 --> 21:25.041
He thinks his father's
a hero in organized crime.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I can't live up to that.

21:35.666 --> 21:36.541
Fuck.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.125
So?

21:51.208 --> 21:53.291
This is better
than your fake surgeon plan, isn't it?

21:53.375 --> 21:54.208
Yes.

21:54.833 --> 21:55.958
This is a proper place.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.333
I need to tell Ali.
He doesn't know about the operation.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.625
Well, I'm going to start the briefing.

22:02.916 --> 22:04.791
The operation will start in two hours,

22:04.875 --> 22:07.958
in collaboration with
the Colombian military already on site.

22:08.541 --> 22:10.791
The objective is to arrest the Hazans.

22:11.375 --> 22:14.708
Wait. What do they mean, arrest?
Are they going to jail?

22:15.500 --> 22:18.541
Obviously, Clémentine.
To the police, they escaped.

22:18.625 --> 22:20.625
That's better
than having your organs harvested.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.250
And you're not gonna do anything?

22:22.333 --> 22:24.916
Yes, I'll fight to get them out of jail.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.208
That could take years.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.375
Hold on.

22:27.458 --> 22:30.583
If you send Olivier back to jail,
I'll kill you, you dirty fucking cops!

22:30.666 --> 22:34.000
Whoa! Calm down, honey!

22:34.083 --> 22:35.708
-She's joking.
-No!

22:35.791 --> 22:38.666
Not at all. I'll pull the plug on you,
like you did to Gramps and Granny

22:38.750 --> 22:40.333
'cause you didn't want to pay the home.

22:40.833 --> 22:41.916
She's joking.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.416
I'm begging you, stop.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.000
You're talking nonsense. Calm down, honey.

22:46.083 --> 22:46.958
She's joking.

22:47.041 --> 22:47.875
All right…

22:52.916 --> 22:54.500
No, no bienvenido.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.833
Fuck you.

22:58.708 --> 22:59.750
Up yours!

23:00.833 --> 23:03.041
Your tight little assholes, bam!
Stretched out!

23:03.833 --> 23:05.708
She's joking.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.666
All right, Aïda, come and help me, please.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.958
No, I'm trying to call Ali.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.583
The life of an elephant is very peaceful.

23:13.666 --> 23:14.875
Their favorite hobby

23:15.458 --> 23:17.291
is rubbing their genitals

23:17.375 --> 23:19.333
on an old, fallen tree trunk.

23:19.416 --> 23:21.916
The dead tree retains enough bark

23:22.541 --> 23:24.541
to allow these young elephants

23:24.625 --> 23:28.708
to scratch
their testicles and anus effectively.

23:28.791 --> 23:30.083
The strongest ones,

23:30.166 --> 23:32.791
making the most of their domination
over the rest of the group,

23:33.875 --> 23:35.708
use their authority…

24:12.416 --> 24:13.875
-Lower your weapon!
-You lower yours.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.750
-Lower your gun.
-Lower yours, asshole.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.625
You're robbing me at my place?

24:18.125 --> 24:20.458
I'll shoot. I don't care.
I have nothing to lose.

24:20.958 --> 24:21.916
I'm gonna kill you.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.375
You think I can't do it? Take that!

24:27.041 --> 24:29.791
It's chocolate! Don't shoot.
It's chocolate.

24:31.125 --> 24:32.500
-Listen carefully.
-Yes?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.458
If you don't want to die
with your friends, the Hazans,

24:36.166 --> 24:38.541
you have to take me
to where you buried your money.

24:39.333 --> 24:40.375
-All right?
-Yes.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.666
Go get dressed.

24:50.541 --> 24:52.541
Really good, Silvio. Nice work.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.958
Very good.
Call me when you've found the money.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.083
All good. My colleague
is in the forest with your friend Ali.

25:11.208 --> 25:14.333
-Fuck, that's fantastic. He's alive.
-That's great news.

25:14.416 --> 25:17.416
Wait. If Ali has to find the money,
that's not at all great news.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.250
-Dad, stop it.
-True, that isn't great.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.541
Guys, we gotta send good vibes, okay?

25:21.625 --> 25:22.750
You're right.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.208
Ali, bro, I'm begging you.
For once in your life,

25:27.166 --> 25:29.416
use your head.

25:36.750 --> 25:39.458
-Olive, what are you doing?
-We said good vibes.

25:39.541 --> 25:42.416
-The Kaddish.
-That's a prayer for the dead, you idiot.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.791
-I know, but it's the only one I know.
-Shut up, then.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.083
Hello, William?

25:50.166 --> 25:53.625
It's Ali. I can't reach Aïda.
Is she with you?

25:53.708 --> 25:55.666
No, but it makes sense
she's not answering.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.166
She's handling something important.
I can't tell you about it.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.083
Okay, that's all right.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.500
You'll help me.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.708
Look in the living room. There's a vase.

26:03.791 --> 26:06.458
-I wrote some numbers on it.
-There's no vase.

26:06.541 --> 26:07.916
All right, that's enough.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.916
Get the GPS coordinates
and hang up, okay? Come on.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.041
Look on the coffee table.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.208
An ugly vase.

26:14.291 --> 26:17.208
Oh, that one. Clémentine broke it.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.375
Goddamn Clémentine.

26:26.458 --> 26:27.291
Yeah.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.791
Okay. I'm writing it down.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.375
What are you writing?

26:34.208 --> 26:36.875
01-47-20-

26:37.625 --> 26:41.083
0001-

26:43.375 --> 26:45.458
14-18-

26:46.250 --> 26:47.125
39-

26:48.125 --> 26:48.958
45.

26:49.750 --> 26:50.916
Yes.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Thanks, William. Have a good day.

26:55.791 --> 26:56.708
Get out.

27:03.541 --> 27:04.416
It's

27:04.916 --> 27:05.750
over there.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.208
Silvio.

27:18.666 --> 27:20.625
-What did he say?
-I don't know.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.416
What did he just say?

27:24.958 --> 27:25.958
I don't know.

27:27.791 --> 27:29.833
-What's he saying?
-I don't know.

27:33.125 --> 27:34.125
He doesn't know.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.083
They don't know.

27:36.166 --> 27:37.333
I heard that, Jo.

27:45.708 --> 27:48.000
Your friend
doesn't know where the money is.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.250
No.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.375
We've wasted enough time. This is over.

27:51.458 --> 27:55.333
No! It's impossible for him to not know.
He buried the money.

27:55.416 --> 27:58.208
Yeah, you have to give him time
'cause Ali's very reliable.

27:58.291 --> 28:01.333
-Yes, very reliable.
-Yeah, let him sniff around a little.

28:01.416 --> 28:03.208
He's a real truffle pig.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.583
-He'll find the money.
-For sure.

28:09.250 --> 28:10.250
What?

28:10.333 --> 28:12.208
Hold on. Why me? I didn't do anything.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.125
No, you didn't.

28:13.666 --> 28:15.750
But I want your brother to suffer
when he sees you die.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.250
It's his fault we wasted time.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.541
Son of a bitch!
You're not taking my sister.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.125
No! Stay here.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.041
-Not my kids!
-Let go of her.

28:23.958 --> 28:25.833
You're not taking her. Fuck!

28:26.458 --> 28:28.458
No! Aure!

28:28.541 --> 28:30.208
-No, let her go!
-Dad!

28:36.291 --> 28:38.125
All right, that's good. Dig.

28:40.500 --> 28:43.250
No, according to the GPS coordinates--

28:43.333 --> 28:45.125
I don't give a shit.
You're digging your grave.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.666
What? My grave?

28:47.750 --> 28:48.958
No!

28:49.041 --> 28:50.750
No, we're not far. I'm telling you.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.833
It's around here. I'm sure of it.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.583
It's somewhere here. I'm sure of it.
I recognize this place.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.375
Let me go, motherfucker.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.083
Let me go.

29:01.875 --> 29:03.250
Please don't do this.

29:03.333 --> 29:04.708
Hold on! Fuck!

29:04.791 --> 29:06.000
We have money!

29:07.416 --> 29:08.500
No!

29:42.875 --> 29:44.250
Okay, start the operation.

30:06.125 --> 30:07.125
Scalpel.

30:11.416 --> 30:13.083
No, not my daughter!

30:59.833 --> 31:01.416
There's no one here. It's empty.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.541
I swear. I don't understand.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.666
Fuck. If they're not there,
then where are they?

32:27.375 --> 32:29.500
