00:01.252 --> 00:03.295
<i>Last season on The Good Place...</i>

00:04.046 --> 00:06.215
In the afterlife, there's a Good Place

00:06.298 --> 00:07.550
and there's a Bad Place.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.844
You're in the Good Place.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.179
Eleanor, you are my soulmate.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.474
Chidi, you'll stand by my side
no matter what, right?

00:15.933 --> 00:18.644
Of course I will.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.396
Wait, what?
- Eleanor, Chidi

00:20.479 --> 00:22.940
I would like you to meet
Tahani and Jianyu.

00:23.107 --> 00:23.983
Boop!
- Oh!

00:24.275 --> 00:25.901
You booped me.
- I did.

00:25.985 --> 00:28.863
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.657
- What's up, homie?
- The problem in the neighbourhood

00:31.907 --> 00:33.242
is me.

00:33.409 --> 00:36.245
You have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.331
The Bad Place is owed two people.
You can decide.

00:39.832 --> 00:43.753
Holy motherforking shirtballs.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.297
This is the Bad Place.

00:47.757 --> 00:48.758
Except for you four

00:48.841 --> 00:51.719
everyone in this neighbourhood
is one of us.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.138
You saw us all on Earth

00:54.889 --> 00:57.558
a selfish ass, an idiot DJ

00:57.892 --> 01:00.728
a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.022
You thought we would torture each other.

01:03.439 --> 01:05.691
The only thing you succeeded in doing

01:06.317 --> 01:07.777
was bringing us all together.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.321
That's it! My big mistake

01:10.780 --> 01:13.532
was having you be soulmates
living next to each other.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.951
Next time, I'll spread you out

01:16.035 --> 01:17.411
so it's more of a slow burn.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.747
I'm gonna erase your memories,
make a few changes

01:19.830 --> 01:22.416
and start over again. Just gotta
get the boss-man to sign off.

01:22.792 --> 01:25.461
If this thing goes sideways again,
you are done.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.004
Do your worst. We figured

01:27.046 --> 01:29.090
it out once, we can do it again. Janet.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.299
Open up.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.926
Because you know what, Michael?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.179
Ya basic--

01:35.304 --> 01:37.098
You, Eleanor Shellstrop,
are dead.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.225
Cool.
- I'm your soulmate.

01:39.475 --> 01:41.644
You'll stand by me no matter what, right?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.396
Hold that thought.
Is it OK if I go work out?

01:44.605 --> 01:47.358
I gotta stay jacked.
It's who I am.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.193
See you soon.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.528
Hi there.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.696
I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.199
After I was rebooted,
I found it in my mouth.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.952
What the fork is a "Chidi"?

01:58.744 --> 02:00.246
Why can't I say fork?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.464
OK, here we go.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.591
Confidence, Mikey.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.635
Project confidence.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.388
There he is! How's it going,
boss-man?

02:17.471 --> 02:20.015
Enough chit-chat. Is everything
in place for version two?

02:20.224 --> 02:24.019
Yup! We're keeping everything from
version one that made them miserable

02:24.311 --> 02:26.689
adding a bunch of new stuff that
they'll hate.

02:27.273 --> 02:30.860
For example, all the coffee is
from those little pods.

02:31.277 --> 02:33.279
Diabolical.

02:34.989 --> 02:38.450
Plus, they will all have new
soulmates, of course.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.120
You gotta trust me on this, boss.
I've thought of everything.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.998
I won't let you down.
- I think you will.

02:44.623 --> 02:47.001
I think this entire project of yours
is stupid and doomed to fail.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.962
I think you're going to be retired,
eliminated from existence

02:50.087 --> 02:51.714
and burned on the surface
of a billion suns.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.508
And I have no doubt that you
and your cockamamy experiment

02:54.633 --> 02:56.594
will go down in history
as colossal failures.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.429
You know, I think if--
- Toodle-oo.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.557
<i>OK, take two, folks.</i>

03:02.016 --> 03:03.893
Any last questions
before we start up again?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.687
Yes.
- Just so I'm clear...

03:06.770 --> 03:09.106
we're not pairing them up this time?
- Correct.

03:09.398 --> 03:13.652
Obviously, the eventual goal
is to get them to torture each other but...

03:13.944 --> 03:17.364
first we're going to create some nice,
individual torment.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.534
In version one, making them soulmates

03:20.701 --> 03:23.412
we probably bit off more
than we could chew.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.914
We could bite them?

03:24.997 --> 03:26.957
I didn't know we were allowed to
bite them!

03:27.291 --> 03:29.043
That's an expression, Chuck.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.377
Alright, go ahead, Vicky.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.713
Yeah, I have some questions
about my new character.

03:33.464 --> 03:37.343
I feel like I got Real Eleanor -
like, I <i>got</i> her, you know?

03:38.177 --> 03:41.430
But this new character, "Denise",
I mean, who is she?

03:41.639 --> 03:42.681
I don't get her.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.768
Is she a quirky best friend type,
or more of a...

03:46.185 --> 03:48.812
a femme fatale "sexuality is her weapon
of choice" type?

03:49.146 --> 03:50.147
Both, both those things.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.150
I have some questions
about my character too, like...

03:54.068 --> 03:55.903
can he bite them?
- No.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.154
OK, reminder.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.949
The most important thing tonight,
and this is crucial

04:00.407 --> 04:03.160
you need to get Eleanor drunk
at the welcome party

04:03.744 --> 04:06.664
so she will say and do
a bunch of bad stuff.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.624
And then we take that stuff

04:08.958 --> 04:12.628
and use it to build our chaos
sequence in the morning.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.713
For example, you remember last time?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.715
She stole all the cocktail shrimp

04:17.174 --> 04:20.636
and we made giant nightmare shrimp
fly through the sky?

04:21.387 --> 04:24.098
See, it's those details
that make her realise

04:24.431 --> 04:26.183
she's in danger of being found out.

04:28.227 --> 04:33.065
OK. I know that this kind of large-scale
deception

04:33.190 --> 04:35.067
is not what you were trained to do.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.487
There are gonna be days when you're just
sick of being around

04:38.570 --> 04:41.073
these disgusting humans, with their...

04:41.991 --> 04:46.161
weird, gross little mouths
and their stupid elbows.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.456
You're gonna be tempted
to say, "Screw it."

04:49.832 --> 04:53.168
"Can't we just go back to HQ
and do this the old-fashioned way?"

04:53.544 --> 04:56.463
"Pull out some fingernails,
toss someone in an acid pit"

04:56.755 --> 05:00.301
"fire up the old penis flattener?"
And sure...

05:00.342 --> 05:02.094
sure, that sounds nice.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.263
But it also sounds easy.

05:04.596 --> 05:08.434
We're all here because we believe
that there's a better way

05:08.475 --> 05:10.436
to make humans miserable.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.605
And I... I believe in you.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.568
So, "torture" on three.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.863
- Ready? One, two, three...
- Torture!

05:21.071 --> 05:23.490
And biting!
- Nope! No.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.459
Hey, lady?

05:34.585 --> 05:35.586
Can you come back?

05:36.587 --> 05:37.463
J...Joey?

05:38.839 --> 05:39.757
Janine?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.302
J... Jaja?

05:44.803 --> 05:46.221
Why don't I ever listen

05:46.263 --> 05:48.057
to people when they talk about themselves?

05:48.265 --> 05:50.184
No, it's annoying, and I'm right not to.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.062
OK, Chidi, where are you?

05:53.395 --> 05:54.646
Or what are you?

05:55.898 --> 05:57.566
A type of soup, maybe?

06:02.446 --> 06:03.322
Hi there.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.867
I'm Eleanor.
- Nice to meet you, Eleanor. I'm Nina.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.452
This is my soulmate, Bart.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.497
Love it.
Love people's names

06:11.747 --> 06:14.500
and love learning all about them.
Where are you all from?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.043
Well, oddly enough

06:16.085 --> 06:18.212
I was born in Mozambique--
- Cool.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.590
Listen, do you guys know if there's, like,
a Neighbourhood phone book

06:21.632 --> 06:23.092
with everybody's name listed in it?

06:23.342 --> 06:26.595
Oh, I don't think so, cos,
I mean, there's no phones here.

06:26.637 --> 06:27.721
There are no phones here?

06:29.431 --> 06:30.307
Of course.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.892
Duh!

06:32.059 --> 06:35.354
There's no use for 'em.
I always prefer talking to people anyway.

06:35.604 --> 06:39.233
People are like nature's apps.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.777
Huh.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.696
Anyway, we're on our way to get some pizza.
Would you like to join us?

06:44.780 --> 06:46.824
Maybe we could get to know each other
a little bit, chat.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.700
Uh, I'm good.
I'm gonna explore a little bit.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.994
But it was so nice to meet you Nina,
and B...

06:52.413 --> 06:53.288
bye-bye!

06:57.793 --> 06:59.128
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.381
Chidi?

07:02.714 --> 07:03.674
Are you Chidi?

07:08.637 --> 07:11.682
Eleanor? What are you up to?
- Oh, hey there, Michael.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.809
Just getting to know everyone
in the neighbourhood.

07:13.892 --> 07:14.768
Oh!

07:15.018 --> 07:17.688
Who was that mysterious
gentleman wearing the nightgown?

07:18.605 --> 07:22.985
Oh, uh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk
who never speaks.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.362
Might be a little hard to get to know him.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.741
Eleanor, you and I both know

07:29.783 --> 07:32.786
that you're not like everyone else
in this neighbourhood.

07:33.745 --> 07:37.082
Everyone here led a remarkable life.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.793
But you...

07:39.835 --> 07:42.963
the work you did
as an environmental activist

07:43.255 --> 07:45.549
was just extraordinary!

07:45.632 --> 07:49.094
Ah. Well, it's the environment.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.513
I mean, I loved...

07:51.555 --> 07:53.307
um... mushrooms.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.934
I can honestly say that.

07:56.185 --> 07:59.897
Well, it paid off, because you
were the number one point-getter

07:59.980 --> 08:01.732
in this entire neighbourhood.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.902
As such, I was just hoping
that you could say a few words

08:05.027 --> 08:08.155
at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.407
How can I say no?

08:10.449 --> 08:12.659
Can I say "no"?
It doesn't feel like I can say "no."

08:12.743 --> 08:14.495
But if I can, Michael, I'm saying "no".

08:14.578 --> 08:16.914
OK, so, you'll speak for...

08:16.955 --> 08:18.916
maybe an hour or so?
Hey, you know what?

08:18.957 --> 08:21.460
I got you a little something to wear here.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.713
Now, all the top point-getters
wear these on the first night.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.383
Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me...

08:29.259 --> 08:31.887
So, long story short,
my heart is in the Pope

08:32.221 --> 08:35.516
my liver's in the Dalai Lama,
and my teeth were strung into a necklace

08:35.641 --> 08:37.768
for a child-king in French Polynesia.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.355
But it got me into the Good Place so,
can't complain.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.232
Wow. Can I...

08:44.107 --> 08:45.984
tell you something?
Just soulmate to soulmate?

08:46.068 --> 08:46.985
Hold that thought.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.530
I'm gonna head to the gym.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.199
Oh, you're serious. Again? Right now?

08:53.450 --> 08:55.160
Yeah. I'll catch you later!

08:56.745 --> 09:00.332
Hey there, Best Person!
You must be Eleanor.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.292
I'm Jessica, the host.
- Hi.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.754
Michael told us all about your speech.
I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.382
Me neither, Jessica. Me. Neither.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.717
Aw, don't be nervous. Here.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.513
Liquid courage.
- Actually, um...

09:14.555 --> 09:16.515
you know what?
I think I need to keep a clear head.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.685
Can you imagine getting drunk
before giving a big speech?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.563
Getting kicked out
of your niece's christening

09:22.646 --> 09:24.565
and then, only later,
once you've sobered up

09:24.606 --> 09:26.191
realise you don't even have a niece.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.526
It's like, who was that kid?

09:28.986 --> 09:31.780
So, Eleanor,
you were an environmental lawyer.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.448
That's fascinating.
- Yeah.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.367
I know. Just don't ask me any questions
about it.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.619
I am so sick of describing
exactly what it means.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.163
Hey, I'm headed to the bar.
Can I grab you something?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.040
How about a margarita?
- No, I'm good.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.043
Actually, I'm the best,
according to the sash.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.590
She's still not drinking?
- Nope.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.593
Something's off.
- Should we...?

09:52.968 --> 09:54.636
Om-nom-nom-nom...

09:54.678 --> 09:55.804
No.
- Mm-mm.

09:55.846 --> 09:56.763
Keep it together.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.144
Ah, screw it.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.771
Couple of quick shots...

10:05.480 --> 10:07.733
And then I'm coming for you,
shrimpies.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.699
Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.829
These are for you.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.831
Drink up.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.752
Hi. Is your name Chidi?

10:27.252 --> 10:28.128
Yes?

10:28.253 --> 10:31.590
Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.
- What?

10:31.673 --> 10:35.344
Listen to me very carefully.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.346
We need to talk.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.897
Chidi? Come on in.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.067
<i>So there really is an afterlife?</i>

10:50.734 --> 10:55.030
I can't wait to have breakfast
with Kant and lunch with Michel Foucault

10:55.322 --> 10:56.573
and then have dinner with Kant again

10:56.615 --> 10:58.283
so we can talk about
what came up at breakfast.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.787
I'm sorry, Chidi, all the great philosophers
in history

11:02.329 --> 11:03.664
ended up in the Bad Place.

11:04.289 --> 11:08.210
All of my heroes are...?
- Being tortured. Yes, I'm afraid so.

11:08.377 --> 11:13.006
Actually, it is kind of clever
how they punish philosophers.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.219
Every day, they make them
go to school naked

11:17.803 --> 11:21.139
and then they take a test
in a class they've never been to.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.059
And then they smash them
with hammers.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.894
And that part is not so clever.

11:26.311 --> 11:30.732
But the point is, Chidi,
you were way better than all of them.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.567
You're safe.

11:34.653 --> 11:38.031
No way. Soulmates are real?
- They sure are.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.326
Although, your soulmate situation
is a little unusual.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.329
Oh, no.
I don't have one, do I?

11:44.413 --> 11:45.789
That's fine. I mean, who needs
a soulmate, anyway?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.791
My soulmate will be...

11:48.500 --> 11:49.376
books!

11:49.835 --> 11:51.837
No, no, it's not that you don't have
a soulmate

11:51.920 --> 11:54.506
it's that you have multiple soulmates.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.216
Here. Now...

11:56.842 --> 11:59.052
Normally, our omniscient system

11:59.094 --> 12:01.638
perfectly analyses each person's profile

12:02.013 --> 12:04.266
and then matches him or her
with another person.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.769
But in your case, the system matched you
with two other people.

12:08.478 --> 12:12.023
It's a rare occurrence,
like a double rainbow

12:12.149 --> 12:15.610
or someone on the Internet saying,
"You know what?"

12:16.236 --> 12:17.696
"You've convinced me I was wrong."

12:17.821 --> 12:19.614
So, how do you choose
who I should be with?

12:19.781 --> 12:21.241
Oh, I don't choose.
You do, Chidi.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.286
I... what?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.664
This is Angelique, Pedro, and Pevita.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.334
According to the system, either Pedro

12:31.418 --> 12:34.671
or Chidi could be matched perfectly
with either Angelique

12:34.755 --> 12:36.548
or Pevita. So figure it out.

12:36.882 --> 12:37.799
Should be fun.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.470
Cool... beans.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.221
One second, guys. Um, so... so...

12:43.263 --> 12:44.264
So...
- Yeah?

12:44.306 --> 12:48.477
So... making decisions isn't necessarily
my strong suit.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.521
I know that, buddy.
You once had a panic attack

12:51.563 --> 12:54.357
at a make-your-own-sundae bar.
- There were too many toppings.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.111
And very early in the process
you had to commit to a chocolate palate

12:58.195 --> 12:59.780
or a fruit palate,
and if you couldn't decide

12:59.863 --> 13:03.158
you wound up with kiwi, Junior Mint, raisin,
and it just ruins everyone's night.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.496
Chidi, I am so sorry.
I literally cannot choose for you.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.541
This has to be your decision.
Buddy, you gotta trust me.

13:12.709 --> 13:16.254
I would never place you
in a painful situation.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.089
Right.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.217
- Um...
- You ready, Chidi?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.844
Here you go, Chidi.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.472
One slice of Hawaiian,
straight out the oven for you.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.599
I'm Denise.
Welcome to my pizza place.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.768
Thanks, Denise.
- And here's one for you.

13:29.851 --> 13:30.727
Have a nice day.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.523
It's interesting that Hawaiian pizza
is so popular here.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.942
Yeah, I guess a lot
of the residents here love it.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.444
Kinda makes you wonder what type of pizza
they have in the Bad Place, huh?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.074
So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.910
We must have just missed each other.
What was your thesis on?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.954
Oh, gosh. It was so boring.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.415
It was called, "Cultural Relativism
and Moral Absolutism"

13:52.499 --> 13:55.877
"An Exploration of Values As Seen
Through The Works of Alain LeRoy"

13:55.919 --> 13:57.629
"...Locke and Immanuel Kant."

13:58.004 --> 13:59.798
Shut up. You read it?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.926
No, but that pairing
is the most obvious pairing

14:03.051 --> 14:04.511
to employ in a paper with that title

14:04.553 --> 14:06.721
and I wanna read it so bad!

14:07.764 --> 14:09.140
What about Morocco?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.601
You ever travel there?

14:14.271 --> 14:15.146
No.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.233
What about anywhere else?

14:18.275 --> 14:20.026
You been anywhere else?
- No.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.906
So, first impressions?

14:25.448 --> 14:28.243
Anyone?
- I kinda wanna hear what Chidi thinks.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.872
Well. Um, I mean, you're both

14:31.913 --> 14:35.542
brilliant, accomplished women,
and Pedro, you're great too.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.128
Just amazing people. I'm surrounded. Ah!

14:38.295 --> 14:42.132
Ahh! But, if I had to say

14:42.173 --> 14:47.304
who I sort of immediately bonded to
on a gut level

14:47.470 --> 14:50.307
I think I would say that I...

14:50.348 --> 14:53.476
kind of feel like my soulmate is...

14:53.518 --> 14:54.394
Angel--

14:54.477 --> 14:56.354
Wait, wait!

14:57.898 --> 14:59.733
There was a mistake in the calculations.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.737
We had a four-hour time gap
in your profiles on May 10, 2003.

15:04.029 --> 15:08.325
I corrected that day's events for all of you,
and ran the numbers again and...

15:08.575 --> 15:11.161
and the final result proves definitively

15:11.369 --> 15:13.622
that Pedro is Angelique's soulmate

15:13.705 --> 15:16.166
and Chidi, your soulmate is Pevita.

15:17.626 --> 15:19.836
That was close.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.672
Hey, you guys hadn't made a decision yet,
had you?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.425
No! We did not.
No one said anything.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.385
I didn't hear anything,
and I certainly didn't say anything.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.887
That's for darn sure.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.980
OK. Alright.

15:39.648 --> 15:40.565
See you later.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.655
This is fun. It's a fun party.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.532
There's no question about it,
this is a fun situation.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.868
Hey, you guys are here.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.371
The fun continues, nay, increases!

15:55.080 --> 15:56.748
You two look nice.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.750
Thanks! And you look...

16:01.378 --> 16:02.379
fine.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.048
Would I say you look better
than anyone else here?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.132
No, I wouldn't say that.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.676
Do you look bad? No.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.928
But good? Would I go as far as to say
that you look good?

16:10.762 --> 16:11.930
Doubtful. Hey, wine.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.432
Mmm. Uh...

16:14.474 --> 16:15.976
Do I feel like red or white?
- Oh...

16:16.518 --> 16:17.936
deep down in your heart of hearts

16:17.978 --> 16:19.688
you probably already know
which one you want.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.442
Why isn't anyone talking?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.736
Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?
- Mm-hm!

16:32.867 --> 16:34.369
Oh, hey!

16:34.536 --> 16:36.371
Chidi, right? Denise.

16:36.663 --> 16:40.208
We met earlier, remember?
- Oh, yeah, hi.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.335
Are you limping?
- Yeah, I am.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.628
Crazy story.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.173
See, I was a trapeze artist
in an illegal circus in Bangladesh...

16:47.257 --> 16:49.759
Angelique.
- Hey. How are you doing?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.680
Oh, well, uh... Heh. You know...

16:54.556 --> 16:56.766
My stomach's in knots,
I'm stress-grinding my teeth

16:56.933 --> 16:58.977
and it feels like my soul is being
suffocated.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.729
You know, just your standard
paradise stuff.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.399
How about you?
- It's been a little uncomfortable.

17:05.025 --> 17:09.029
I think Pedro maybe heard you say
that thing you were gonna say.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.698
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I...

17:12.574 --> 17:13.450
but I have to ask.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.995
Do you feel the way I feel?
- We can't talk about this.

17:17.162 --> 17:20.707
Well, I know, but if the numbers
were that close, Angelique

17:20.790 --> 17:22.208
I think I'm supposed to...
- Stop!

17:23.084 --> 17:25.295
Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.133
These are for you.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.762
Hi. Is your name Chidi?

17:34.721 --> 17:37.390
Yes?
- Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.351
What?
- Listen to me very carefully.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.771
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.439
We need to talk.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.732
About what?

17:45.815 --> 17:48.568
Just shut your mouth, smile at me,
and walk over here.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.447
OK, you're definitely my least favourite
person I've met so far.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.116
OK, I'm sorry,
this is really not a good time.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.242
I'm right in the middle of something.
- Dude.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.203
I'm guessing we have
about 30 seconds to talk

17:58.286 --> 17:59.454
before someone notices.

17:59.704 --> 18:04.084
When I got here, some robot lady
appeared out of thin air and gave me this.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.461
You mean Janet?
- Oh, that's it! Janet.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.796
Hi there.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.130
Not now, Janet. Buzz off.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.340
OK.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.717
Now, I have no memory of writing this

18:12.801 --> 18:14.385
but it is my handwriting.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.054
And that's your name, right?

18:16.262 --> 18:20.809
So, for some reason, at some point,
I put this note into

18:21.309 --> 18:23.645
that whatever-lady's robot mouth.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.939
You already forgot her name?
- No, I didn't.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.274
Her name is...

18:28.817 --> 18:29.692
Janet.

18:29.734 --> 18:30.610
Hi there.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.070
Fork off!
- OK.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.822
- From the second I got here

18:33.863 --> 18:35.490
these nerds have been acting real weird

18:35.615 --> 18:36.825
trying to get me drunk.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.702
My soulmate ditches me
every time I try to talk to him

18:40.036 --> 18:44.707
and this Zen-master guy gave me
this magic bracelet thing

18:45.125 --> 18:46.251
and then he just ran away.

18:46.543 --> 18:50.630
Something very strange is going on here,
and the only person I trust is me

18:50.713 --> 18:52.340
and me told me to find you.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.468
So, what's the deal?
What's happening? What have you got?

18:55.552 --> 18:57.428
Uh... OK, I...

18:58.263 --> 19:02.392
Look, I'm, I'm sorry, but none of this
means anything to me

19:02.475 --> 19:05.103
and I've got my own problems to deal with.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.649
Attention, everyone!

19:09.691 --> 19:10.650
Speech time!

19:12.026 --> 19:15.488
I know you're probably not a magic wizard
trapped in an amulet but if you are

19:15.572 --> 19:17.157
please get me out of this speech.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.251
Tahani. Come on in.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.005
You're in the Good Place, Tahani.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.966
Ooh, what a surprise!

19:36.801 --> 19:37.969
But yes, I accept.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.097
This is your soulmate, Tomas.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.101
Now, Tomas was a doctor
with the International Rescue Alliance

19:45.185 --> 19:47.478
and you raised money that ultimately

19:47.520 --> 19:50.857
funded his medical missions.
It's just so perfect!

19:50.899 --> 19:53.151
Wow.
- It's lovely to meet you, Tahani.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.444
Charmed, I'm...

19:54.485 --> 19:55.403
short.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.781
I'm sorry, did I just say "short"?
I-I meant to say

19:58.865 --> 20:02.327
"charmed, I'm sure," of course,
because I am charmed to meet you.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.455
It's just an unfortunate Freudian short.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.750
Shall we?

20:10.585 --> 20:12.587
So, where did you attend medical short?

20:12.962 --> 20:17.467
So, this is the living room as well as
the kitchen and the bedroom.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.428
It's so... cosy.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.431
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.683
Michael, I don't mean to be rude

20:25.767 --> 20:28.061
but this is simply absurd.

20:28.353 --> 20:31.481
Yes, thank you.
I didn't want to say anything but...

20:31.648 --> 20:34.442
There's only two of us,
and we don't need all this space.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.778
- "All this space"?
- Oh, of course.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.822
You two humanitarians don't want
anything so extravagant.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.241
I'll just get rid of the second floor.

20:43.284 --> 20:46.329
OK, I'll let you two have some alone time.
I will see you at the party.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.293
Well... certainly is quite quaint.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.754
So, it's just... fun.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.675
I daresay even quite charm... ahhh, no.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.385
What's the matter?

21:00.551 --> 21:04.222
Sorry, it's just a self-portrait of my...
my sister.

21:05.139 --> 21:08.184
Wonderful.
- Your sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil?

21:08.268 --> 21:09.894
I used to play her music for my patients.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.606
At times, it felt like Kamilah's songs
were curing the malaria for us.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.942
Great.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.445
Well, I best be getting changed for tonight.
- Mm.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.864
Can hardly wear a day dress
to an evening event.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.242
Sounds good.
I'm ready whenever you are.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.328
Is that what you're wearing?

21:27.662 --> 21:28.538
Oh, yeah.

21:28.871 --> 21:32.417
My years treating remote villagers
taught me to favour comfort over style.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.460
But you should wear whatever you prefer.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.421
Well, I mean...

21:37.046 --> 21:40.300
as we are soulmates, perhaps I,
I should also...

21:41.426 --> 21:42.802
dress down.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.309
You alright, my dear?

21:50.268 --> 21:51.185
Yes

21:51.519 --> 21:54.147
just not used to dressing
like a plumberess.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.151
Is that what you call a female plumber,
or is it a toilet sweep?

21:58.776 --> 22:00.236
Or clog wench?

22:00.903 --> 22:03.531
In any case, that's how I'm dressed.

22:03.698 --> 22:08.119
My darling, you are in the Good Place. Relax.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.706
Feel the breeze on your feet.
That's why Crocs have holes in them.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.418
I'll get us a drink. Lower that
beautiful face for me, won't you?

22:16.210 --> 22:18.296
Lower-lower-lower-lower-lower...
Mwah!

22:21.799 --> 22:23.426
Tahani? You alright?

22:23.468 --> 22:25.219
Michael, hello! Yes.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.472
I'm having a splendid time.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.641
Although, if I'm being honest

22:30.767 --> 22:34.354
a few aspects of my day
have been sub-optimal.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.606
Really? Like what?

22:36.898 --> 22:38.566
Well... my house

22:38.983 --> 22:43.613
is a bit small, which is fine,
it's just not what I'm used to and...

22:43.946 --> 22:48.117
Tomas is lovely,
but we haven't really "clicked" yet

22:48.326 --> 22:50.620
to use a mundane colloquialism

22:50.661 --> 22:52.080
which I suppose I should do

22:52.413 --> 22:55.249
now that I'm wearing cargo pants.

22:55.375 --> 22:59.587
Tahani, it's very common
to experience adjustment pains.

22:59.921 --> 23:03.591
But the system matched you and Tomas,
and the system is never wrong.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.886
But guess what?
This is the Good Place.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.263
If you want your house to be larger,
then just ask.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.891
Do you want something this big?

23:11.933 --> 23:13.810
Or maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.020
I know, I know. How about a moon?

23:16.396 --> 23:18.564
Would you like to live
on your own private moon?

23:19.023 --> 23:21.609
No, no, no. My house is wonderful.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.820
And really, it's so silly

23:23.903 --> 23:26.489
to want a bigger house of all things,
here in paradise.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.574
So no, no changes needed.

23:28.699 --> 23:29.867
OK, alright.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.786
But if you change your mind, just ask.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.664
Because all the other residents
are very happy

23:34.705 --> 23:38.000
so it'll give me plenty of time to deal with
whatever requests you make.

23:38.543 --> 23:40.920
No demand is too...

23:40.962 --> 23:42.213
what's the word? Oh, "frivolous".

23:42.505 --> 23:44.549
OK? Wow...

23:44.841 --> 23:45.800
That is rough.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.223
Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.479
These are for you.
Drink up.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.398
Oh, no, no, I...

24:00.481 --> 24:02.900
Hey, hey, hey! Twinsies!

24:03.443 --> 24:04.694
I'm sorry?
- Look!

24:05.486 --> 24:07.071
cargo-pants buddies!

24:07.822 --> 24:09.907
I bet we have a lot in common.

24:10.074 --> 24:14.328
I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
How about you?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.038
OK.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.083
Crocs also?

24:21.085 --> 24:22.086
Speech time!

24:22.211 --> 24:25.882
I know you're probably not a magic wizard
trapped in an amulet, but if you are

24:25.923 --> 24:27.258
please get me out of this speech.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.093
I've asked our top point-getter, here

24:29.135 --> 24:32.513
to say a few words.
So, take it away, Eleanor!

24:39.187 --> 24:41.689
The dictionary defines "best"

24:41.731 --> 24:43.733
- as being--
- Oh, God, boring!

24:44.609 --> 24:46.527
I'd like to say a few words if nobody minds.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.154
Thank you, wizard.

24:48.362 --> 24:51.199
I am Tahani. Tahani am me.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.494
And even though I wasn't
the "number one point-getter"

24:55.036 --> 24:57.330
I just wanted to welcome you all
to the Neighbourhood.

24:57.788 --> 25:01.459
You all look so beautiful tonight,
with your regular-sized pockets

25:02.418 --> 25:03.878
regular-sized soulmates.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.506
Oh, no offense, darling, wherever you are.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.216
Probably somewhere down there.

25:08.424 --> 25:11.928
Why don't you try to ease her off
the stage and take over yourself?

25:12.094 --> 25:14.305
The point is, we're all good people, right?

25:15.014 --> 25:17.892
We all did the right thing
whenever we could.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.811
And that's why it's so nice to be here
among you in this...

25:21.270 --> 25:23.314
massive house that I want.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.858
I want this house. Give it.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.529
No, I'm just kidding.
But really, give me the house.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.281
Hey there, hot stuff.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

25:32.406 --> 25:34.033
Get your hands off me!

25:34.575 --> 25:37.411
Oh, you think you're better than I am,
don't you, just cos you're wearing that.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.705
Look at that terrible placement and angle.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.666
Is this your first time ever wearing a sash?

25:41.916 --> 25:44.001
Yeah, it is, but I think if we all just--

25:44.043 --> 25:45.253
Well, give it to me then!

25:51.050 --> 25:52.051
I got her off the stage.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.311
Jianyu? Come on in.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.983
Before we start,
I know you were a Buddhist monk

26:07.149 --> 26:08.901
who kept a vow of silence.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.321
Would you prefer to remain silent
here as well?

26:15.700 --> 26:18.703
Every resident here in the Good Place
has a soulmate.

26:18.828 --> 26:22.582
Now, some of the pairings are platonic,
some are romantic

26:22.999 --> 26:26.210
but what you have
with your soulmate is unique.

26:26.586 --> 26:31.632
You have a spiritual connection
that transcends the physical realm.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.928
This person's gonna be your best bud.

26:41.684 --> 26:46.063
Jianyu, let me introduce you
to your soulmate, Luang.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.357
He is also a Buddhist monk

26:48.399 --> 26:50.443
from the Lumbini zone of Nepal.

26:50.651 --> 26:55.906
You and Luang share an identical
soul like binary stars

26:56.073 --> 26:59.035
orbiting one another in a perfect,
reflective harmony.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.622
You won't ever have a single moment
of loneliness

27:03.122 --> 27:07.460
because you'll always be
right next to each other for eternity.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.880
OK, I'm gonna let you two get acquainted.

27:10.963 --> 27:14.634
I'm sure you have a lot to not talk about.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.553
Because... well, you get it, you get it.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.645
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.856
Chidi? Are you Chidi?

28:15.361 --> 28:18.072
Eleanor? What are you up to?
- Oh, hey there, Michael.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.241
Just getting to know everyone

28:20.282 --> 28:21.158
- in the neighbourhood.
- Oh.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.661
Who was that mysterious...

28:44.140 --> 28:46.142
Hello, you beautiful spirits.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.477
Can I offer you two something to drink?

28:48.728 --> 28:49.937
- Janet!
- Hi there.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.565
This is Janet.

28:52.648 --> 28:56.152
Now, she can get you literally
anything you want.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.278
All you have to do is ask.

28:57.361 --> 29:02.575
Of course, you two won't ever want anything,
because you're perfectly content.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.536
Oh, I know.
How about something special?

29:05.828 --> 29:08.581
Janet, two yak's milks, please.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.040
Enjoy.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.060
Speech time!

29:30.227 --> 29:32.271
If we all just--
- Well, give it to me then!

29:35.900 --> 29:37.026
I got her off the stage.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.946
Tahani? Are you alright?
- Yes, fine.

29:41.322 --> 29:44.074
Never better.
Top of my game, actually.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.745
You'll have to excuse me,
cos I've got to go, so... Oh, look!

29:48.662 --> 29:49.705
I've got some shrimp.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.375
In one of my many, many cargo-pants pockets.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.171
What the fork is happening?

30:02.927 --> 30:04.345
OK, here we go.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.306
How's it going, boss-man?
- Enough chit-chat.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.933
Is everything in place for version two?

30:09.266 --> 30:10.935
Yup, I've thought of everything.

30:12.019 --> 30:12.978
I won't let you down.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.564
I was just hoping
that you could say a few words

30:15.689 --> 30:17.107
at tonight's welcome party.

30:17.191 --> 30:18.859
You know, just to introduce yourself.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.070
How can I say no?

30:21.195 --> 30:23.572
So... cosy.

30:24.406 --> 30:27.701
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.789
How about something special? Janet.
Two yak's milks, please.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.458
Why isn't anyone talking?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.377
Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?
- Mm-hmm.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.549
Michael, may I please speak
with you privately?

30:41.882 --> 30:42.883
Sure, sure.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.888
It just feels like I used to be Real Eleanor

30:47.930 --> 30:50.391
and now I'm Denise.

30:50.516 --> 30:53.894
Denise is a good part,
with a great backstory.

30:54.436 --> 30:58.148
You run the best pizza place
in the Neighbourhood.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.819
You have a cat, and that's cool.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.363
I took this job because it seemed

31:04.405 --> 31:05.906
fun and different

31:06.031 --> 31:08.826
and in the original version,
I got to break Chidi's heart

31:08.909 --> 31:11.328
like, 20 times, and it was great.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.372
I mean, he was miserable.

31:13.831 --> 31:17.084
And now, Angelique gets to torture him?

31:17.585 --> 31:18.794
Angelique is a hack.

31:18.961 --> 31:22.590
I can act circles around her!
But I have nothing to do!

31:22.798 --> 31:25.301
I am a Ferrari, OK?

31:25.342 --> 31:28.387
And you don't keep a Ferrari in the garage.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.472
I hear your concern. I do.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.891
And I promise you

31:31.932 --> 31:34.685
there is a great arc coming for Denise
the pizza lady

31:34.768 --> 31:36.478
in about 80 years or so.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.899
Chidi is going to accidentally kill your cat.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.693
It's gonna give you a great chance to shine.

31:42.776 --> 31:46.614
Can I just have something that makes me
stand out?

31:46.822 --> 31:50.326
A mysterious past, or a limp!
I want a limp.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.828
This is supposed to be the Good Place.
Why would...?

31:54.288 --> 31:56.165
OK, I, no, I hear you.
I'll tell you what.

31:56.624 --> 31:59.084
Go nuts. Limp your heart out.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.797
Oh, hey! Chidi, right?

32:03.839 --> 32:04.715
Hi.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.008
Are you limping?

32:08.218 --> 32:09.678
How's it going?

32:09.720 --> 32:11.138
We're having some trouble with Eleanor.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.766
She's not engaging in conversation,
she's not drinking.

32:14.058 --> 32:15.267
Eleanor's not drinking?

32:16.185 --> 32:19.855
She brought a flask in the car
during her driver's test!

32:20.481 --> 32:22.775
OK, we need to keep things moving here.

32:22.816 --> 32:25.027
I'm about to make her talk for an hour.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.029
She'll definitely end up insulting somebody.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.615
Speech time!

32:29.782 --> 32:31.158
We're all good people, right?

32:31.825 --> 32:34.787
We all did the right thing
whenever we could.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.997
I think if we all just--
- Well, give it to me then!

32:40.125 --> 32:43.337
Tahani? Are you alright?
- Yes, fine.

32:43.963 --> 32:44.838
Never better.

32:45.172 --> 32:47.007
You'll have to excuse me,
cos I've got to go.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.342
Oh, look...

32:49.301 --> 32:51.637
What the fork, man?
- I know that book.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.181
Is that some kind of nerd pick-up line?

32:54.223 --> 32:55.516
Because it's only kind of working.
- No.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.059
The note you showed me before.

32:58.686 --> 33:01.605
Alright, this is from a book called
"What We Owe to Each Other".

33:01.689 --> 33:02.564
I used to teach it.

33:02.606 --> 33:04.650
I was a professor of ethics
and moral philosophy.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.568
Alright, brag much?
- No, I'm trying to help you.

33:06.652 --> 33:07.653
Sorry. OK.

33:07.945 --> 33:10.197
I have never seen you before in my life

33:10.239 --> 33:14.535
but I think somehow
that we know each other.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.081
That definitely sounded like
a pick-up line.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.749
And I'm not <i>not</i> interested

33:20.833 --> 33:22.668
but we need to figure this out first.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.045
It's not that bad, right?

33:25.629 --> 33:28.340
I mean, we got a drunken speech.
That's good.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.218
No. It isn't.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.638
Tahani gave the drunken speech
instead of Eleanor.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.641
We can't build a chaos sequence
out of Tahani's speech

33:37.766 --> 33:40.477
because she thinks she belongs here...

33:41.353 --> 33:42.229
ding-dong.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.232
OK, we can still salvage this.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.901
Where's Eleanor?
- She's gone.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.571
I can't find her anywhere.
- Maybe she left with Chidi?

33:50.946 --> 33:52.573
He's gone too.
- What?

33:52.740 --> 33:55.242
Or maybe she left with Jason.

33:55.284 --> 33:58.037
You lost Jason?
How is that even possible?

33:58.704 --> 34:01.498
Your only job is to stand next to that idiot.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.667
I got distracted by the fire!

34:04.168 --> 34:05.377
I love fire.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.630
You know, my main job is
to burn people with fire.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.507
What's up, guys?
- What are you doing here?

34:10.591 --> 34:11.842
Why aren't you with Eleanor?

34:12.009 --> 34:13.844
Oh, I told her I was going to the
gym again.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.181
Why would you say that
in the middle of a party?

34:17.306 --> 34:18.724
You told me too.
- No, I didn't.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.393
You said if Eleanor tries to confess
that she doesn't belong here

34:21.477 --> 34:24.271
find a reason to avoid her, like saying,
"I'm going to the gym"

34:24.354 --> 34:25.314
so that's what I've been saying.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.859
That was a suggestion
of the type of thing you could say!

34:28.942 --> 34:29.818
Don't...

34:31.195 --> 34:35.908
How many times have you specifically
told her you were going to the gym?

34:36.742 --> 34:37.618
Five.

34:38.077 --> 34:38.994
No, nine.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.621
You dimwit!

34:40.662 --> 34:41.538
Hey, man!

34:41.914 --> 34:45.000
I was perfectly happy in my old job
in the twisting department.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.295
People came in, and I twist them
until they snapped in half

34:48.420 --> 34:49.797
and I move on to the next one.

34:50.089 --> 34:52.216
But this job is weird!

34:52.591 --> 34:54.843
It's all talk, no twisting.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.012
So if you don't like the way I do it,
get somebody else.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.723
I'm going to the gym!
- Fine. Yeah, you do that.

34:59.807 --> 35:00.682
You go to the gym.

35:01.183 --> 35:05.354
OK, we can still pull this off,
we just need to find the four humans. OK?

35:05.854 --> 35:06.730
OK.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.398
Right now.

35:10.818 --> 35:15.906
Everyone in this room,
find those four humans!

35:18.784 --> 35:21.161
Are you gonna talk, or just walk around
like a nerd

35:21.203 --> 35:22.996
trying to get a personal best
on his Fitbit?

35:23.080 --> 35:26.458
I'm sorry, I'm trying to process
a tremendous amount

35:26.542 --> 35:28.085
of insane information.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.878
I mean, you're not supposed to be here

35:30.003 --> 35:34.007
but you and I clearly met here, somehow,
before now.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.385
I mean... does that mean
that I'm not supposed to be here?

35:36.552 --> 35:37.594
I don't know, dude.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.264
Were you a good person on Earth?
- I... I think so.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.808
I spent my life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the uni--

35:42.891 --> 35:44.059
Oh, no!

35:45.686 --> 35:47.146
I used almond milk in my coffee

35:47.271 --> 35:49.606
even though I knew about
the negative environmental impact.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.442
What?
- Eleanor, what do we do?

35:52.526 --> 35:53.527
I don't know, dude!

35:53.986 --> 35:56.572
But we better figure it out soon,
or we're doomed.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.623
Uh, Janet?

36:06.665 --> 36:07.916
Hi there, Jianyu.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.209
Hi, Janet!

36:09.668 --> 36:12.087
Um, can I tell you something?
- Sure.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.214
I'm not Jianyu.

36:14.548 --> 36:16.592
And I'm not a silent monk.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.678
My real name is Jason.
And I don't know what's going on.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.513
I got here and Michael said I'm a monk

36:21.555 --> 36:23.765
and he told me I was gonna
have a new best friend

36:23.849 --> 36:25.767
and that we were gonna live in a yogurt.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.228
A yurt.
- Oh, yeah, "yurt" for short.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.105
I was psyched to meet
my new best friend

36:30.355 --> 36:33.150
but he turned out to be this weird silent guy

36:33.192 --> 36:35.110
that won't leave me alone.

36:35.277 --> 36:37.321
I don't wanna go back to my yogurt.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.199
Can I go to your house?

36:40.532 --> 36:44.328
I don't have a house, Jason.
I live in a boundless void.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.496
Can I go there?
- No.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.582
It's a boundless void.

36:49.583 --> 36:50.459
OK.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.379
So, what you're saying is,
there are certain aspects of your existence

36:54.463 --> 36:56.882
here in the Good Place
that are confusing for you

36:57.466 --> 37:00.969
and you're searching for someplace
to go where you feel less lonely.

37:02.304 --> 37:03.513
I know somewhere you could go.

37:07.601 --> 37:08.477
Why did you do that?

37:08.560 --> 37:11.563
Because you were nice to me.
You're my friend.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.106
OK!

37:15.567 --> 37:16.485
OK!

37:17.986 --> 37:20.113
OK, so, if we got all the way
to Scanlon

37:20.197 --> 37:23.492
we must have been studying
very intensely for a very long time.

37:23.825 --> 37:27.037
Or, you grabbed a random book of mine
and just tore a page out.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.664
I'm gonna be honest,
that sounds more like me.

37:30.374 --> 37:31.333
Ah!

37:31.375 --> 37:34.127
Eleanor and Chidi.
What a pleasant surprise.

37:34.294 --> 37:35.963
I'm so happy you two have met.

37:36.338 --> 37:39.633
I'm just going door-to-door,
apologising for the commotion

37:39.716 --> 37:40.676
earlier tonight.
- Ah.

37:40.842 --> 37:44.346
The first night in the afterlife
can be a little overwhelming.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.765
Don't worry about us, Michael.
We are doing just fine.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.892
Oh, good, good.
Glad to hear that.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.018
Well, it's getting late.

37:50.644 --> 37:53.313
Chidi, allow me to escort you
back to your house.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.315
Um...
- Uh, hello, all.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.067
Sorry for the late hour, Eleanor.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.695
I wanted to stop by
and give you back your sash.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.238
That's OK.
You can just keep it.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.948
No! I don't deserve it.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.450
I made a complete fool
of myself tonight.

38:05.534 --> 38:08.620
I interrupted your big speech,
badly stained my cargo pants

38:08.787 --> 38:11.206
which, I have to admit,
are quite comfortable.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.625
Oh, God, what's happened to me?

38:14.042 --> 38:15.627
I'm praising off-the-rack separates!

38:15.794 --> 38:16.920
Tahani, please. It's late.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.213
I think what we should do is--
- No.

38:18.255 --> 38:21.550
Look, ever since I got here,
it feels like something's been off.

38:22.092 --> 38:25.762
Tahani. There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.389
<i>That's</i> her soulmate?

38:27.973 --> 38:29.182
Is there a second one of him

38:29.224 --> 38:30.892
- that stands on his shoulders?
- Chidi!

38:31.018 --> 38:33.562
There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.272
OK, alright, everybody.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.774
Now we are really imposing
on Eleanor here.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.652
Chidi, let's everybody take off...
- Hey, Eleanor.

38:40.694 --> 38:44.865
This person would like to speak
with you privately. About something.

38:45.282 --> 38:47.075
Oh, really?
- Yep.

38:47.743 --> 38:48.702
Bye!

38:48.785 --> 38:50.829
This is the wise monk
who gave me the magic amulet.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.122
I gotta figure out what it means.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.707
Could be the key to this entire mystery.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.584
Luang, perfect, uh...

38:55.876 --> 38:59.004
Why don't you take Jianyu
back to your yurt right away?

38:59.212 --> 39:01.006
Homie, no!

39:01.173 --> 39:04.009
I'm not spending another second
with this loser.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.012
You said he was gonna be my best friend,
but he is not.

39:07.095 --> 39:11.683
My best friend from Jacksonville
was named Pillboi and he was dope!

39:11.808 --> 39:15.687
We would talk together, get high together,
throw old batteries at drones together.

39:15.771 --> 39:18.148
But this guy can't hold a camel to Pillboi.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.901
OK, I no longer think he's a wise monk

39:20.942 --> 39:22.694
and I'm pretty sure
this is just a piece of garbage.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.364
Babe, there you are. I've been worried--
- Let me stop you.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.281
Can I guess?

39:26.323 --> 39:28.200
You've been "worried sick" about me.

39:29.659 --> 39:30.535
I'm headed to the gym.

39:32.496 --> 39:35.457
Sure, why not?
- I'm quite confused.

39:35.540 --> 39:39.127
Let me explain, gorgeous.
I don't know what this place is

39:39.211 --> 39:41.671
but it is certainly not the Good Place.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.924
Michael is forking with us.

39:44.591 --> 39:46.635
Like a prank show?
- Yeah, like a prank show.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.471
Except according to this note,
it's a prank show

39:49.596 --> 39:51.181
we've all been on before.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.767
What note?
- Apparently, I wrote myself a note

39:53.934 --> 39:55.685
and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.

39:55.936 --> 39:57.729
Janet. Her name is Janet.
- Oh, right, Janet.

39:57.854 --> 39:58.939
- Hi there.
- Hi Janet!

39:59.106 --> 40:01.441
Hi Jason.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.153
Are you kidding me?

40:05.529 --> 40:09.199
Eleanor Shellstrop, you sneaky little

40:09.825 --> 40:13.537
so-and-so.
That was some very quick thinking.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.163
I'm extremely impressed.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.500
And to be honest, I'm relieved.

40:19.084 --> 40:22.963
At least there's an explanation
for why this all went south so fast.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.382
But you're not gonna be so lucky next time.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.008
Next time?
- What?

40:27.175 --> 40:28.635
- Yeah.
- He's gonna do it again!

40:29.511 --> 40:32.264
That's not gonna work this time, dummy.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.058
OK, excuse me.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.

40:35.142 --> 40:37.853
I demand to speak to your superior.
- I am so sorry, madam.

40:37.894 --> 40:38.979
Please forgive me.

40:41.273 --> 40:45.485
Well, as humans like to say,
third time's the charm, right?

40:47.070 --> 40:50.323
I take full responsibility
for the false start.

40:50.907 --> 40:54.494
But I assure you all,
there is no note this time.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.663
I'll prove it to you. Janet!

40:56.788 --> 40:57.831
Hi there.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.208
Hi, Janet.
Open your mouth please.

41:01.543 --> 41:02.544
Thank you.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.381
See, no notes.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.759
No clues or loopholes, nothing in there!

41:11.136 --> 41:12.012
Thank you, Janet.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.638
So, let's all just pretend

41:13.722 --> 41:15.098
the last attempt never even happened.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.684
Questions?
- Maybe it's none of our business

41:18.018 --> 41:20.604
but did you tell Shawn what happened?
- Yes, I did.

41:20.729 --> 41:23.148
And he completely understood.

41:23.273 --> 41:25.901
As a matter of fact, he found the whole thing
kind of funny.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.694
But he was very supportive

41:27.777 --> 41:30.614
and he says he's very excited
for us to get going again.

41:30.697 --> 41:31.615
So, anyone else?

41:32.949 --> 41:34.910
Anybody? No?

41:35.285 --> 41:37.496
Then let's get out there
and make some miseries!

41:41.249 --> 41:43.084
Testing, one, two, three.

41:46.296 --> 41:47.589
Hey there, boss-man.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.716
You were supposed to call me
this morning, give me an update.

41:50.050 --> 41:51.384
Oh.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.887
Right, sorry. Yeah, it's just the, uh...

41:54.679 --> 41:56.765
the chaos sequence was going so well

41:57.057 --> 41:59.142
better than the first time, in my opinion.

41:59.392 --> 42:01.853
Eleanor got completely drunk last night.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.563
She talked for, like, an hour.

42:03.647 --> 42:06.733
You know, even flashed somebody,
so we had a lot to work with.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.861
So, attempt number two is on track so far?
- Oh, smooth as silk.

42:09.945 --> 42:12.155
Everything's great.

42:12.239 --> 42:14.991
Oh! Sounds like everything's going well
back there too.

42:15.075 --> 42:16.618
We're trying out the new butthole spiders.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.370
Ah!
- They're enormous.

42:18.662 --> 42:21.373
You know, good old-fashioned torture,
the way it's supposed to be.

42:22.541 --> 42:23.917
Good luck with attempt number two.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.753
And remember, there will be no
attempt number three.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.718
Eleanor.
Come on in.
