24:10.208 --> 24:12.125
My father's done working
for you.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.750
Non Compos Mentis declaration

24:13.750 --> 24:16.834
approved by the probate court
for your records.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.417
For my records?

24:18.417 --> 24:19.458
Who is this little shit?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.792
My lawyer.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.709
Detective, I represent
Mickey Donovan

24:22.709 --> 24:25.792
as well as his court-appointed
guardian, Ray Donovan.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.000
Which one of you assholes
paid off Judge Zinn

24:29.000 --> 24:30.417
to sign this piece of fiction?

24:30.417 --> 24:32.709
Detective Muncie,
I can assure you

24:32.709 --> 24:34.500
that all of this documentation
was achieved above board.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.250
If he backs out,
I am locking him up.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.583
You do that,

24:37.583 --> 24:39.875
and we'll bleed
your department dry

24:39.875 --> 24:41.417
with an elder abuse suit.

24:41.417 --> 24:43.417
[Muncie]
Give me a fucking break.

24:43.417 --> 24:45.583
He wore your wire,
did what you asked.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.917
[Muncie]
Not all of it.

24:47.917 --> 24:50.583
It's gonna have to be enough,
Detective.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.000
Get the fuck out of here,

24:55.000 --> 24:57.500
and take your fucking
paperwork with you.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.458
Once the dust settles
on all of this,

25:04.458 --> 25:06.291
how about I take you out
for Burmese?

25:06.291 --> 25:08.083
We'll be watching you,
asshole.

25:08.083 --> 25:09.458
You fucking cross on red,

25:09.458 --> 25:10.792
I'll be on you
like a fly on shit.

25:10.792 --> 25:13.375
Mango beef, coconut rice,

25:13.375 --> 25:16.083
you're missing out
on a good time.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.792
Hey, you're late.

25:21.834 --> 25:26.625
Avi, listen, 1915,
Ottomans looted their villages.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.333
They massacred the men.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.458
They raped the women,
drowned their kids,

25:30.458 --> 25:33.250
and burned people in hay lofts.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.834
- He in there?
- Yeah.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.125
You got the folder?

25:36.125 --> 25:37.291
Yeah.

25:37.291 --> 25:38.792
I took a dick pic.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.458
What?

25:44.458 --> 25:46.583
This Cochran,
he's a sexual pervert.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.583
I took a picture
of my dick on his computer.

25:49.583 --> 25:52.667
We send it to his coworkers,
he loses his job.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.333
You took a dick pic?

25:54.333 --> 25:56.709
It'll come in handy,
believe me.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.667
All right.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.083
Not how I imagined it.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.834
- Okay, I do it for the team.
- No, no, no.

26:07.834 --> 26:12.208
Av, it's--it's shapely.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm in rehearsals, Ray.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.041
It's a really bad time
for me to leave the studio.

26:18.041 --> 26:19.792
Congratulations
on the new gig.

26:19.792 --> 26:21.709
Oh, thanks.

26:21.709 --> 26:23.625
Nick Jonas is appearing tonight.

26:23.625 --> 26:27.166
- Hasmig's going on instead.
- Hasmig?

26:27.166 --> 26:29.625
Yeah, she's gonna do a song
about her great grandfather

26:29.625 --> 26:30.875
in Armenian.

26:33.041 --> 26:35.208
- What?
- You heard me.

26:35.208 --> 26:37.667
Look, if she wants to sing

26:37.667 --> 26:40.875
"Thighs Go Boom" dressed
in gold lamé hot pants,

26:40.875 --> 26:43.166
then I will think about bumping
Nick Jonas. Otherwise--

26:43.166 --> 26:44.667
She's gonna sing her song

26:44.667 --> 26:47.917
about Armenian genocide
on your show tonight.

26:47.917 --> 26:50.250
Ray, I'm a fucking
guest host, okay?

26:50.250 --> 26:52.667
If I, on my first night,

26:52.667 --> 26:56.417
have a pop star singing
about slaughtered Armenians,

26:56.417 --> 26:58.875
the network will have me back
doing weather tomorrow.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.542
Do you have any idea what it's
like doing forecasts for L.A.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.208
in a fucking drought?

27:03.208 --> 27:04.542
Why don't you tell me?

27:07.792 --> 27:09.667
No. Okay?

27:09.667 --> 27:11.500
I'm saying "no," Ray.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.500
Okay.

27:25.792 --> 27:28.250
No, no, no.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.083
You can't do that.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.792
That--that's the old me.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.667
The old you?

27:35.667 --> 27:37.709
It was six fucking weeks ago,
Flip.

27:37.709 --> 27:41.083
Tell the Jonas kid
he can go on tomorrow.

27:41.083 --> 27:44.792
See you.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.000
I'll be in my room.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.709
[Abby]
Thanks, Terry.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.208
- Hey, Uncle Terry.
- Hey, kiddo.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.625
I just got suspended
for a week.

28:08.625 --> 28:11.208
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

28:11.208 --> 28:12.834
Sit the fuck down.

28:18.125 --> 28:20.625
[sighs]

28:28.041 --> 28:29.792
Want to explain this?

28:32.417 --> 28:34.500
Where did you get them?

28:36.500 --> 28:38.333
I stole them from him.

28:38.333 --> 28:41.041
I don't believe you.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.291
Did he do something to you?

28:52.291 --> 28:54.917
No. Jesus.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.458
We're going back to that dean.

28:56.458 --> 28:57.750
He'll lose his job.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.000
He shouldn't be
working with children.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.083
I'm not a child.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.083
You're a fucking minor.

29:01.083 --> 29:04.125
Mom, I'm almost 18,

29:04.125 --> 29:05.792
and I love him.

29:05.792 --> 29:08.583
I love him, and he really
has deep feelings for me.

29:08.583 --> 29:10.458
I'm calling the fucking cops.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.375
Please do not overreact.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.208
It is not an overreaction,
Bridge.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.542
What do you think your father's
gonna do when he finds out?

29:16.542 --> 29:18.083
Do not tell him.

29:18.083 --> 29:19.208
You know what'll happen.

29:19.208 --> 29:20.208
You know what he'll do.

29:22.709 --> 29:24.709
Just go to your fucking room.

29:24.709 --> 29:28.625
Get the fuck out of my sight!

29:28.625 --> 29:30.208
[door knocks]

29:30.208 --> 29:32.500
Come in.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.417
Mr. Cochran was reportedly
using Mr. Donovan's father

29:35.417 --> 29:38.166
as an informant
on the Sully Sullivan case.

29:38.166 --> 29:41.458
It made his career, then
everything blew up in his face.

29:44.709 --> 29:47.250
Get this FBI guy
back here again.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.542
You're sure?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.709
You have the video?

29:51.709 --> 29:54.250
It's prurient
in nature, Mr. Finney.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.959
I do hope so.

30:02.959 --> 30:05.250
[moaning on tablet device]

30:05.250 --> 30:07.291
Mm.

30:12.208 --> 30:15.500
[whistling]

30:20.041 --> 30:23.583
[imitating Avi] Hey, my friend,
my name is Avi Rudin.

30:23.583 --> 30:25.166
I need access to my unit here,

30:25.166 --> 30:27.583
but I forgot my key.

30:27.583 --> 30:29.041
12 bucks for a new one.

30:29.041 --> 30:30.250
You got ID?

30:30.250 --> 30:32.083
No, no, I lost my wallet.

30:32.083 --> 30:33.250
I had a robbery.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.625
Mm. I need ID.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.709
You need ID?

30:36.709 --> 30:38.083
Okay.

30:38.083 --> 30:39.500
You said 12 bucks, huh?

30:43.125 --> 30:44.792
How's that?

32:02.542 --> 32:04.041
[phone rings]

32:04.041 --> 32:05.458
Shit.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.417
Talk to me, Lena.
Where the fuck is she?

32:10.417 --> 32:11.709
[Lena]
I don't know what to tell you.

32:11.709 --> 32:13.375
She said she'd be there by now.

32:13.375 --> 32:15.208
- It's a stretch Hummer.
- What's the plan, Ray?

32:15.208 --> 32:18.041
No fucking stretch Hummer
here.

32:18.041 --> 32:20.667
You get lost looking
for the ocean, asshole?

32:20.667 --> 32:22.667
I'll call you back.

32:22.667 --> 32:23.917
Something came up.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.208
Who the fuck is that?

32:28.208 --> 32:29.709
That's my son.

32:29.709 --> 32:31.125
We need to speak
to your grandma.

32:36.500 --> 32:40.834
Come in.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.083
Fuck.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Mickey, Ivan is expecting you
in Long Beach.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.417
You will make him wait
on the dock, dick in hand?

33:03.417 --> 33:07.583
Mrs. Minassian, uh,
this is my son.

33:11.875 --> 33:14.458
I have not seen
this son before.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.542
He'd like to say something.

33:17.542 --> 33:19.750
Can you hear him out?

33:19.750 --> 33:20.959
Please.

33:36.959 --> 33:41.000
Mrs. Minassian,
my father's a dipshit.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.625
He's always been a dipshit.

33:43.625 --> 33:46.792
Unfortunately there's nothing
I can do about that.

33:46.792 --> 33:50.750
What I can do is offer to pay
you back for any inconvenience

33:50.750 --> 33:52.959
he might have caused you,

33:52.959 --> 33:55.750
so if you could come up
with a number--

33:55.750 --> 33:57.667
There is no number.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.542
We have a deal.

33:59.542 --> 34:01.125
He belongs to me.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.166
Mrs. Minassian,
I'm sure you can understand

34:05.166 --> 34:06.417
my father's an older man.

34:06.417 --> 34:08.250
Let him eat dog food.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.458
Let him shit his pants.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.083
I don't care.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.166
I own him.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.917
- Ow!
- Hey, what the fuck?

34:16.917 --> 34:18.875
Don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.500
All right. All right. All right.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.500
Now.

34:32.917 --> 34:36.500
You want out?

34:36.500 --> 34:38.000
There is no out.

34:40.834 --> 34:42.875
This is so disappointing.

34:42.875 --> 34:46.250
Ow! Oh.

34:47.709 --> 34:49.542
[groaning]

34:49.542 --> 34:50.750
Ugh.

34:53.041 --> 34:54.291
Stop this.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.542
Who is that?

34:57.542 --> 34:59.709
It's Hasmig.

34:59.709 --> 35:02.583
- Hasmig?
- It's Hasmig.

35:02.583 --> 35:05.542
- That's Hasmig.
- Hasmig? What's she doing?

35:05.542 --> 35:07.208
Hasmig?

35:09.041 --> 35:11.208
[chuckles]

35:12.750 --> 35:14.166
Go figure.

35:14.166 --> 35:16.125
What brings you here, darling?

35:17.625 --> 35:19.834
My friend asked me to come.

35:19.834 --> 35:22.417
Who's your friend?

35:22.417 --> 35:27.250
That man, he is a friend
to all Armenians.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.166
Yes. Yes.

35:46.917 --> 35:49.917
We have problems from this,

35:49.917 --> 35:53.417
I deal with you only, hmm?

35:53.417 --> 35:54.667
Sure.

35:56.166 --> 35:59.083
Davros, get your camera.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.917
We make pictures for the walls.

36:04.083 --> 36:06.291
Ugh. God.

36:22.125 --> 36:25.208
[engine starts]

37:03.000 --> 37:03.834
What the fuck is this?

37:03.834 --> 37:05.667
You motherfucker.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.333
Mrs. Donovan--

37:07.333 --> 37:09.834
Don't you "Mrs. Donovan" me,
you motherfucker!

37:09.834 --> 37:11.583
Okay--

37:11.583 --> 37:13.291
Here's what's gonna happen,
all right?

37:13.291 --> 37:15.333
You listen to me.

37:15.333 --> 37:19.000
You're gonna quit your job, then
you're gonna come back here.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.667
You're gonna pack
your shit,

37:20.667 --> 37:22.667
and then you're gonna go back to
wherever the fuck you came from.

37:22.667 --> 37:24.333
Do you understand me?

37:24.333 --> 37:25.959
Okay.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.000
I think that there's been
a misunderstanding.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.083
A misunderstanding?
Fuck you!

37:29.083 --> 37:31.834
She thinks you fucking love her,
you motherfucker!

37:31.834 --> 37:33.333
Mrs. Donovan, just--

37:33.333 --> 37:37.417
My--my wife died,
and Bridget found out,

37:37.417 --> 37:39.834
and she told me
about her boyfriend,

37:39.834 --> 37:42.917
and she started showing up
for extra help.

37:42.917 --> 37:46.417
I thought that she wanted
to raise her grade,

37:46.417 --> 37:51.041
but it became clear
that she was obsessed with me.

37:51.041 --> 37:52.458
[scoffs]

37:52.458 --> 37:55.500
How did she get
your pills?

37:55.500 --> 37:57.125
I don't know.

37:57.125 --> 38:01.125
I have chronic pain
and--car accident.

38:02.709 --> 38:05.041
Um...

38:05.041 --> 38:08.000
A bottle went missing
in my desk.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.250
I thought I misplaced it.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.333
Okay.

38:19.750 --> 38:24.041
For your sake and Bridget's,

38:24.041 --> 38:26.417
I'm gonna choose to believe you.

38:26.417 --> 38:28.709
But if I find out
you're fucking lying,

38:28.709 --> 38:30.166
I am gonna come back here,

38:30.166 --> 38:31.417
and I am gonna fucking
kill you myself.

38:31.417 --> 38:32.750
You understand me?

38:32.750 --> 38:34.583
All right.

38:50.542 --> 38:54.917
Hey.

38:54.917 --> 38:59.792
There you go.

39:03.959 --> 39:05.166
Why couldn't you just
play fucking Bingo

39:05.166 --> 39:07.458
like a normal old man?

39:11.959 --> 39:13.709
I was a shit father.

39:13.709 --> 39:14.959
I know that.

39:16.125 --> 39:18.375
I know how bad I let you down,

39:18.375 --> 39:20.291
and when I see you
with your kids...

39:27.125 --> 39:29.709
We got to talk
about something.

39:29.709 --> 39:32.792
Today,

39:32.792 --> 39:35.875
even in my duress,

39:35.875 --> 39:37.125
it was a joy to watch you work.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.959
You're a tough fucking customer.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.333
You stuck your neck out.

39:42.333 --> 39:43.917
I'm forever grateful.

39:50.125 --> 39:53.291
You got to leave L.A.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.333
What?

39:58.667 --> 40:00.583
I'm tired of worrying
about my family because of you.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.500
You got to go.

40:05.125 --> 40:06.834
They're my family too.

40:06.834 --> 40:08.500
- Yeah?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.208
You sure got a funny way
of showing it.

40:13.959 --> 40:15.500
I'm not going anywhere.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.583
Non Compos Mentis, Mick.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.208
What the fuck
does that one mean?

40:20.208 --> 40:22.000
Power of attorney.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.500
You're gonna do
whatever I tell you to do,

40:24.500 --> 40:26.041
or I'm gonna put you
in the worst shithole

40:26.041 --> 40:28.083
I can find and have them
pump you so full of Thorazine

40:28.083 --> 40:30.458
you won't even know
your fucking name any more.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.458
You motherfucker.

40:34.458 --> 40:37.083
You did all this just to
get one over on me?

40:37.083 --> 40:40.959
I went up against the fucking
Armenian mob for you.

40:40.959 --> 40:42.166
I almost got my fucking head
blown off

40:42.166 --> 40:44.291
because of your bullshit.

40:47.208 --> 40:48.875
You only got one of me, Ray.

40:58.208 --> 40:59.875
I'm sorry, Mick.

40:59.875 --> 41:02.000
You got to go.

41:08.792 --> 41:10.291
Okay.

41:13.375 --> 41:14.583
What?

41:16.917 --> 41:19.417
If that's what you want.

41:26.291 --> 41:30.083
Good.

41:47.125 --> 41:48.625
[door shuts]

41:50.959 --> 41:54.083
[phone vibrates]

41:54.083 --> 41:55.750
- Yeah?
- My father changed his mind.

41:55.750 --> 41:57.667
He's meeting
with the investigators.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.834
- When?
- Right now.

41:59.834 --> 42:01.417
Can you hold them off?

42:01.417 --> 42:03.625
He's already in there
with them.

42:07.542 --> 42:11.291
Any comments you may have made
that reveal racial bias?

42:11.291 --> 42:12.667
Well, people can be sensitive

42:12.667 --> 42:14.709
and read hatred
into anything you say,

42:14.709 --> 42:18.417
but no, I don't believe
I've said anything racist

42:18.417 --> 42:21.083
that would embarrass the NFL.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.625
I know this is delicate,

42:22.625 --> 42:25.000
but we have to go over
your sexual history.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.792
[Finney]
Miss Kim, please don't
take offense at this,

42:28.792 --> 42:32.667
but I wouldn't go
to see a female proctologist,

42:32.667 --> 42:35.291
so when it comes
to discussing personal matters,

42:35.291 --> 42:38.166
I don't feel comfortable
doing it in mixed company.

42:38.166 --> 42:41.333
Mr. Finney, I assure you
I am a professional, and--

42:41.333 --> 42:43.667
And I am old-fashioned.

42:47.041 --> 42:50.625
Ed, do you feel equipped
to handle the questions?

42:50.625 --> 42:52.667
Oh, I schooled at the knee
of the master.

42:54.792 --> 42:56.709
Thank you, Miss Kim.

43:05.125 --> 43:08.542
All right, Mr. Finney,
let's see here.

43:08.542 --> 43:10.959
[clears throat]

43:10.959 --> 43:13.917
Any sexual harassment suits

43:13.917 --> 43:16.000
that were settled out of court?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.583
No.

43:17.583 --> 43:20.208
No business trips to Bangkok
I should know about?

43:20.208 --> 43:22.500
No.

43:22.500 --> 43:26.208
You ever fucked the help,
Mr. Finney?

43:26.208 --> 43:27.625
Enjoying yourself?

43:31.125 --> 43:34.125
Why does Ray Donovan have 3%
of your football team?

43:37.083 --> 43:39.917
I mean, did he just
find it on the ground?

43:42.375 --> 43:45.500
My daughter, Paige,
handled all the details.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.875
So it has nothing at all
to do with Varick Strauss?

43:52.417 --> 43:55.792
How about this guy?

43:55.792 --> 43:57.667
Is this man
your son-in-law, sir?

44:00.333 --> 44:01.917
No.

44:01.917 --> 44:04.000
Any idea why
he might be traveling

44:04.000 --> 44:05.417
on your son-in-law's passport?

44:05.417 --> 44:07.083
I have no idea.

44:07.083 --> 44:08.667
Well, you know he works
for Ray Donovan, right?

44:11.166 --> 44:13.417
I didn't know.

44:13.417 --> 44:15.792
Sir, forgive me, but I find
that very hard to believe.

44:15.792 --> 44:17.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:18.375 --> 44:19.875
Well, we're done here.

44:19.875 --> 44:21.709
If you want to ask me
any more questions,

44:21.709 --> 44:24.750
you'll have to do so
in the presence of my lawyer.

44:24.750 --> 44:27.041
Mr. Finney, whatever you're in
the middle of with Ray Donovan,

44:27.041 --> 44:30.458
if--if you're in the middle
of something with Ray Donovan,

44:30.458 --> 44:33.667
I want you to know,
sir, I'm on your side.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.291
And I want you to know
it's very reassuring

44:40.291 --> 44:43.625
knowing that you're on my side,
a man like you

44:43.625 --> 44:45.458
whose ass and balls
are on display

44:45.458 --> 44:47.959
for all the world to see along
with his wife being fucked

44:47.959 --> 44:51.875
by her suicidal boyfriend,
very reassuring.

44:55.667 --> 44:57.625
Keep the card, Mr. Finney.

44:57.625 --> 44:59.166
My guess is
you're gonna need it.

45:00.417 --> 45:03.834
[door opens]

45:03.834 --> 45:05.625
[Cochran]
Mr. Donovan?

45:05.625 --> 45:07.125
Has there been
a security breach?

45:09.417 --> 45:12.166
Well, you'll be pleased to know

45:12.166 --> 45:15.917
that Mr. Finney here has passed
the vet with flying colors.

45:15.917 --> 45:19.959
My guess is the NFL is gonna
approve his football team.

45:19.959 --> 45:21.834
You're gonna get to go
along for the ride, Ray.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.875
Well, thanks for letting
us poke around, Ms. Finney.

45:39.875 --> 45:41.834
Boy, I bet your ex-husband's
gonna kick himself

45:41.834 --> 45:44.500
when word of your team
reaches Bermuda, huh?

45:44.500 --> 45:46.750
- Belize.
- Belize, right. Yeah.

45:46.750 --> 45:49.333
Always get my "B" countries
mixed up.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.333
You take care now.

45:54.208 --> 45:57.500

45:57.500 --> 46:00.333

- You coming home for dinner?

I'm on my way right now.

about last night.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.875
Okay.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.500
I was with Lena.

46:37.500 --> 46:42.083
We were doing
something for Mick.

46:42.083 --> 46:44.417
I believe you.

46:44.417 --> 46:47.333
You do?

46:47.333 --> 46:49.667
I said I did.

46:49.667 --> 46:50.917
Good.

46:58.709 --> 47:00.917
What if we went back
to Boston?

47:02.709 --> 47:07.208
Be around normal people.

47:07.208 --> 47:09.291
We'd get the fuck out of L.A.

47:14.417 --> 47:16.542
It's good for us here.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.625
What's good about it?

47:29.625 --> 47:31.125

- So cool.

47:31.125 --> 47:35.083
Wow.

47:35.083 --> 47:37.959
Paige?

47:37.959 --> 47:39.750
Don't wear this in public
till next week.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.583
- What's going on?
- We're in business.

47:41.583 --> 47:43.625
Dybek recommended us
to the NFL,

47:43.625 --> 47:45.583
and they're announcing us
Monday.

47:45.583 --> 47:48.125
Amazing, right?

47:50.458 --> 47:52.000
That's great.

47:54.625 --> 47:57.333
I have to get to a meeting.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.917
Walk me out?

48:09.875 --> 48:11.834
What are you doing here?

48:11.834 --> 48:14.834
I wanted to give you
the news in person.

48:14.834 --> 48:17.000
If I crossed a line, I'm sorry.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.208
Okay.

48:21.375 --> 48:23.166
Do you feel any differently?

48:23.166 --> 48:24.667
What?

48:24.667 --> 48:27.583
Now that you got
everything you wanted?

48:33.125 --> 48:34.333
No.

48:37.959 --> 48:40.875
That's too bad.

48:58.875 --> 49:01.542
What the fuck was that?

49:01.542 --> 49:03.375
What?

49:03.375 --> 49:06.875
If you're gonna do that,
have a little sensitivity.

49:06.875 --> 49:08.041
What are you talking about?
Doing what?

49:08.041 --> 49:09.625
[Abby]
Do I have to spell it out?

49:09.625 --> 49:11.917
Don't fucking bring her here.

49:11.917 --> 49:15.041
[Ray]
I didn't bring her here, Abby.
She just showed up on her own.

49:17.667 --> 49:20.041
I'm not listening
to this shit.

49:35.959 --> 49:38.417
I want to show you something.

49:38.417 --> 49:40.917
Get your coat.

50:09.375 --> 50:12.000
Thanks.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.625
Give me the teacher's name
and address.

50:14.625 --> 50:16.458
I'll deal with it.

50:16.458 --> 50:17.709
No.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.792
It's better I do it.

50:20.792 --> 50:22.583
Ray will kill him.

50:22.583 --> 50:27.083
I talked to her teacher.

50:27.083 --> 50:29.375
It's done.

50:29.375 --> 50:31.542
Wait, you...

50:31.542 --> 50:32.667
You talked to him?

50:32.667 --> 50:35.417
Yeah.
