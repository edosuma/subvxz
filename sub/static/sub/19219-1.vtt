WEBVTT

00:00.961 --> 00:02.379
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.587 --> 00:04.923
This land is ours now.

00:05.256 --> 00:07.842
Resist, and you will
be greeted by death.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.055
The only thing that
matters now is killing pike.

00:14.432 --> 00:15.684
- Echo?
- Bellamy.

00:15.892 --> 00:17.268
- You know her?
- Yeah. She's ice nation.

00:17.477 --> 00:18.895
She was in the cage
next to mine.

00:19.104 --> 00:20.313
Where the hell is Echo?

00:22.899 --> 00:24.109
Ai Haiplana.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.239
Alie controls people
one person at a time

00:29.447 --> 00:31.408
until there is no one left.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.660
What we're doing
is too important.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.287
Agh!

00:36.496 --> 00:37.747
We need to increase
the population

00:37.956 --> 00:39.541
in the city of light.

00:40.291 --> 00:41.042
No!

00:41.251 --> 00:43.586
We will not be done
until everyone is with us.

00:43.795 --> 00:45.338
I know how
to stop Alie.

00:45.547 --> 00:48.383
I see it.
It's a kill switch.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.552
Come on, Clarke.

00:51.469 --> 00:54.389
The nuclear power plants
that were destroyed by the bombs

00:54.597 --> 00:55.807
have begun to melt down.

00:56.016 --> 00:58.268
The earth's surface
will be uninhabitable,

00:58.476 --> 01:00.895
so, you see,
the city of light

01:01.479 --> 01:03.481
is the only thing
that can save you.

01:03.690 --> 01:06.192
Would you really condemn
the human race to die

01:06.401 --> 01:07.777
in 6 months?

01:07.986 --> 01:11.156
I'll figure something out.
We always do.

01:12.532 --> 01:14.284
Agh...

01:14.492 --> 01:15.285
Agh!

01:15.493 --> 01:16.661
John?

01:16.870 --> 01:19.164
Hey, hey, it's OK.

01:19.372 --> 01:20.999
Clarke, you're
not acting like someone

01:21.207 --> 01:22.751
who just
saved the world.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.836
Because we didn't.

01:41.895 --> 01:43.229
Indra?

01:43.855 --> 01:45.815
Uh! Uh...

01:57.118 --> 01:59.329
Indra. Indra.

02:01.247 --> 02:02.957
Indra.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.337
- Alie?
- Gone. It's over.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.380
And pike?

02:14.511 --> 02:17.013
I waited
until it was done.

02:17.222 --> 02:18.640
Mm.

02:31.653 --> 02:33.738
Oh...No.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.953
She'll be OK.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.205
Octavia can take
care of herself.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.290
That's not what
I'm worried about.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.128
She won't
be charged.

02:48.503 --> 02:50.672
Everyone will say that
pike had it coming.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.424
Maybe we all do.

03:00.682 --> 03:02.183
How do we tell these
people that the world

03:02.392 --> 03:04.477
is ending after everything
they've been through?

03:04.686 --> 03:06.688
We don't, not until
we know Alie

03:06.896 --> 03:08.481
was telling you
the truth.

03:08.815 --> 03:10.400
It was the truth.

03:11.693 --> 03:13.319
Still, keep it
to ourselves

03:13.528 --> 03:14.737
until we know what
we're dealing with

03:14.946 --> 03:17.031
and how to stop it.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.575
Damn.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.286
You're afraid of how
people will react.

03:21.494 --> 03:25.832
Yes. Besides,
I could use a break

03:26.124 --> 03:28.042
from keeping
you alive.

03:29.836 --> 03:31.504
You gave them back
their pain, Clarke.

03:31.713 --> 03:33.256
Let's not add to it
by telling them

03:33.464 --> 03:35.341
they're gonna die
in 6 months.

03:37.886 --> 03:38.761
Good.

03:38.970 --> 03:43.057
Once everyone's down,
we go home, we get to work.

03:43.266 --> 03:45.393
We didn't survive
this long just to let

03:45.602 --> 03:47.437
a little radiation
takes us out.

03:50.648 --> 03:55.403
Thank you for
keeping me alive.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.329
You don't
make it easy.

04:08.249 --> 04:09.876
He didn't fall.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.255
He chased me in
the city of light.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.259
Lexa killed him.

06:16.002 --> 06:19.297

upgraded your brain.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.346
Are you?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.181
You've been through
more than anyone.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.908
I need quiet
to fix the radio.

06:47.075 --> 06:48.409
Raven, we won.

06:48.618 --> 06:50.286
I'm sure everyone's
fine in Polis.

06:50.495 --> 06:52.163
I hope so,
but until I'm certain--

06:52.372 --> 06:53.664
Do you need help
with the radio?

06:53.873 --> 06:54.957
No. I got this.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.417
You sure?

06:56.626 --> 06:58.211
Rule one of engineering--
no drinking on the job.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.463
Go on. Celebrate.
Please enjoy yourselves.

Polis, this is Arkadia.
Come in, Polis.

07:33.538 --> 07:36.541
Come on. Where are you?

07:57.937 --> 07:59.355
What have I done?

08:01.983 --> 08:03.317
What have we done?

08:06.195 --> 08:08.906
I told you to stay upstairs
with the rest of the wounded.

08:09.407 --> 08:10.992
Do you need
another shot?

08:21.794 --> 08:22.879

Yeah.

here anymore.

Wanheda.

Wanheda.

08:38.853 --> 08:39.937
Clarke.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.695
Good. You're down.
We have to go.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.530
The rover's in
the north woods.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.865
What about
the wounded?

08:51.073 --> 08:52.366
Grounders don't
want our help.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.036
Our people we'll
treat at Arkadia.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.247
Raven, on radio:
Hello?

09:00.625 --> 09:03.127
Bellamy, please come in.

09:03.336 --> 09:05.630
Raven, you OK?

09:06.881 --> 09:09.592
Yeah. Yeah.
We're all in one piece.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.260
That's good.

09:11.469 --> 09:13.012
There's something we
need you to look into.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.306
First, tell me
how my friends are.

09:15.932 --> 09:18.684
Did everyone make it?
Clarke?

09:19.936 --> 09:21.812
I'm here,
thanks to you.

09:22.021 --> 09:22.939
Oh...

09:24.148 --> 09:26.192
Raven, did Alie
ever tell you

09:26.400 --> 09:27.860
why she created
the city of light?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.446
No. Why?

09:34.450 --> 09:35.910
- Clarke?
- Fill Raven in.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.246
- Right. Raven...
- They need a doctor.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.002
Uh!

09:45.211 --> 09:46.754
Roan?

09:47.213 --> 09:49.840
He got shot trying to help me.
I thought he was dead.

09:51.509 --> 09:54.053
Not yet,
but he's close.

09:57.890 --> 09:58.849
No exit wound.

09:59.058 --> 10:00.518
We need to get
the bullet out quickly.

10:01.102 --> 10:01.978
Get away
from our king.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.896
Wait.
Please, no.

10:04.981 --> 10:07.858
You're making a mistake.
We're part of the coalition.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.279
I could save him,
but you have to let me.

10:11.487 --> 10:12.989
We have
our own healer.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.040
Echo...

10:24.125 --> 10:25.501
Hey, Bellamy, don't.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.754
- Man, stop.
- Let her go, Echo. Let her go.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.756
Back off, Bellamy.

10:31.257 --> 10:35.303
Your king is my friend.
Let us help him.

10:36.387 --> 10:38.306
I saw you in
the city of light.

10:38.514 --> 10:42.143
I know you destroyed it.
Thank you for that.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.731
Look around you.

10:47.106 --> 10:49.108
Skaikru did this to us.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.570
Because of them, Ontari,
your rightful commander,

10:52.778 --> 10:53.946
is dead.

10:56.407 --> 10:57.950
This imposter
stole her flame.

10:58.159 --> 11:00.620
No.
Wanheda saved us,

11:01.162 --> 11:04.081
all of us--grounder
and Skaikru.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.750
There would have been
nothing to save us from

11:05.958 --> 11:06.959
if not for you.

11:07.168 --> 11:08.502
Azgeda has
no authority here.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.087
We do now.

11:10.463 --> 11:13.007
In the name of King Roan,
as rightful caretakers

11:13.215 --> 11:14.508
of the throne
of the commanders,

11:14.717 --> 11:17.136
Polis is now
under Azgeda rule.

11:17.345 --> 11:18.971
Like hell it is.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.102
Where's your
war chief, girl?

11:25.311 --> 11:27.521
Our war chief is dead,
ambassador.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.190
As a member
of the queen's guard,

11:29.398 --> 11:31.192
command of the army
has fallen to me

11:31.400 --> 11:32.610
until the king
awakens.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.403
If he awakens.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.739
Until a new commander
can ascend,

11:37.198 --> 11:40.910
Polis is to be ruled
by ambassadors of the coalition.

11:41.619 --> 11:45.289
If Azgeda wants it,
they must take it by force.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.762
Consider it taken.
No Skaikru leaves this city.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.816
Looks like saving the
world will have to wait.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.239
Uh!

12:25.037 --> 12:26.122
That's it.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.348
Ahh! Oh...

12:44.557 --> 12:45.725
Let me help you,
please.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.476
Puh!

12:48.644 --> 12:50.604
It's good to see
you're making friends.

12:53.524 --> 12:54.900
Hello, John.

12:55.109 --> 12:57.236
Glad to see
you made it down.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.447
I could use some help
with the dead.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.657
Go float yourself.

13:02.283 --> 13:04.744
These dead are on you,
too, chancellor.

13:09.206 --> 13:12.293
Hey, what
are you doing?

13:12.460 --> 13:14.920
Stocking up.
What's it look like.

13:15.129 --> 13:18.007
Stocking up
for what, exactly?

13:19.592 --> 13:21.677
It's not safe
for my kind here.

13:21.886 --> 13:23.971
Are forbidden.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.265
I have to leave
this place, John.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.730
So, what, you're gonna
bail on me again?

13:32.938 --> 13:33.814
I didn't bail on you.

13:34.023 --> 13:35.149
I came back,

13:35.357 --> 13:37.318
took the damn chip
because Jaha said

13:37.526 --> 13:39.320
he would
take me to you.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.115
Hey...

13:44.074 --> 13:45.701
Come with me
to Arkadia.

13:49.288 --> 13:50.915
I'm serious,
Emori, OK?

13:51.123 --> 13:52.875
We can be together there.
My people will protect you.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.503
Are you sure
about that?

13:56.086 --> 13:58.631
How many times have
they cast you out?

14:02.843 --> 14:06.931
It's different now.
They owe me, OK? Please.

14:10.601 --> 14:11.727
Come on.

14:17.066 --> 14:19.068
- OK.
- OK?

14:19.276 --> 14:20.528
OK.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.782
We can still pick up a
few things first, right?

14:40.756 --> 14:43.259
Sir, that's
everyone we could find.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.052
Stationed 10 guards
at the temple door.

14:45.261 --> 14:46.178
Are you sure you don't
want me to stay?

14:46.387 --> 14:47.471
You lead them
home, major.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.682
We'll be there
as soon as we can.

15:07.867 --> 15:10.119
- Marcus...
- I'm OK.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.371
We focus on
what comes next.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.436
- Well?
- You're not gonna like it.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.021
When you destroyed
the city of light,

15:37.229 --> 15:38.314
there were a thousand
Azgeda warriors

15:38.522 --> 15:39.899
inside
the city of Polis.

15:40.107 --> 15:40.858
Good timing.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.735
Only way to remove
them is by force.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.987
- Then let's remove them.
- Slow down.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.322
You're talking
about a war.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.449
Yes. Rockline,
Flokru, and Broadleaf

15:48.657 --> 15:50.618
will join Trikru
without question,

15:50.826 --> 15:51.660
but we'll still
be short.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.412
This is madness.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.247
We should be leaving
with the others

15:55.456 --> 15:56.332
while we still
have time.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.460
They know where we live.
If we run, they'll follow.

16:00.044 --> 16:03.047
There are 8 other clans.
How do we get them to join us?

16:03.255 --> 16:06.216
I can do it,
but I'll need the flame.

16:07.718 --> 16:08.844
No.

16:09.053 --> 16:10.304
Clarke, the clans

16:10.512 --> 16:11.764
will follow
whoever has the flame.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.058
- Azgeda won't.
- Then we fight.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.143
- That's the point.
- No, it's not.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.979
The point is, there's
no time for a fight.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.439
We have
to save Roan.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.566
Save him?
They won't let us near him.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.819
Wait a second.
What don't we know?

16:28.030 --> 16:30.032
The reason Alie created
the city of light.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.744
Why?

16:39.166 --> 16:40.918
Nuclear reactors
inside power plants

16:41.126 --> 16:42.836
that survived the bombs
are melting down.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.756
Radiation levels
are already rising.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.300
If we can't figure out
a way to fix it,

16:48.884 --> 16:50.928
all of us will be
dead in 6 months.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.101
- Alie told you this?
- Yes.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.895
- And you believe her?
- Raven's looking into it.

17:00.396 --> 17:01.647
I believe her.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.149
Even if it's true,
that's 6 months away.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.402
There are a thousand
ice nation warriors

17:06.610 --> 17:08.153
on the street
who want to kill us today.

17:08.696 --> 17:09.571
They won't kill us.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.949
How could you
possibly know that?

17:13.283 --> 17:14.618
Because we're
gonna surrender.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.199
Ontari belongs
with her people.

18:09.465 --> 18:10.382
Ohh!

18:31.361 --> 18:33.614
Rrgh...Ooh!

18:50.506 --> 18:52.633
Ahh...Ah!

18:55.803 --> 18:57.304
Tell them I only
talk to Bellamy.

18:59.681 --> 19:00.557
Ugh!

19:11.652 --> 19:12.528
Uh!

19:13.904 --> 19:16.406
It worked.
She's in.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.847
Ohh! Ugh!

19:40.055 --> 19:41.640
Ohh...

19:50.566 --> 19:51.650
Your king's
on the table.

20:07.791 --> 20:08.876
Well, go save him.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.145
I don't
like this, John.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.355
Bellamy's right there.
Just wait here.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.567
She's ice nation.
She can't be trusted.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.611
Never a dull
moment, huh?

20:35.819 --> 20:37.487
Bellamy,
pay attention.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.656
She's part of
the royal guard, spies.

20:40.199 --> 20:41.158
That's why
she's not marked,

20:41.366 --> 20:43.827
very dangerous,
very loyal.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.580
Not to the people
who saved her life.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.540
Bellamy, I know
how you feel about her,

20:49.416 --> 20:50.751
but you can't
lose control.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.461
You offer them
technology, guns,

20:52.669 --> 20:54.046
whatever it takes
to keep her talking.

20:54.463 --> 20:55.255
Is that clear?

20:55.464 --> 20:56.757
I didn't agree
to give them guns.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.258
Well, that's probably because
you're not an idiot.

20:58.467 --> 20:59.509
It won't
get that far.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.136
Our objective
is to buy time

21:01.345 --> 21:02.804
for Abby to save
the king,

21:03.513 --> 21:06.016
and if you want to help,
grab a weapon,

21:06.391 --> 21:07.809
stand a post.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.603
Take mine.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.067
I got this.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.754
Sorry, Bellamy.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.429
What is it?

21:44.638 --> 21:45.722
Do you know what I said
about being safe

21:45.931 --> 21:46.848
with my people?

21:47.057 --> 21:48.892
You plan was better.
Let's go.

21:58.193 --> 21:59.945
Before you say
anything, remember,

22:00.153 --> 22:01.405
I saved your life
by taking you

22:01.613 --> 22:03.073
out of mount weather.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.367
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you to bring the girl,

22:05.575 --> 22:07.452
but I was following
orders, Bellamy.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.997
I wish it
was that easy.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.380
Today, you guys.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.340
I need more time.

22:22.718 --> 22:24.136
I know how it feels
to lose someone

22:24.344 --> 22:25.470
you care about
to war,

22:25.679 --> 22:27.180
but we do what we do
for our people.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.890
You slaughter us,
we slaughter you.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.727
That all went away
in the city of light,

22:32.936 --> 22:34.563
but it's back now,

22:36.648 --> 22:37.899
so here we are.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.320
The bullet is pressing
against his carotid.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.196
It's cutting off
blood flow to his brain.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.115
As soon as I get it out,
he should wake up.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.200
What are the terms
of your surrender?

22:47.534 --> 22:49.953
We recognize
ice nation rule,

22:50.746 --> 22:52.956
and you honor
Lexa's coalition,

22:53.498 --> 22:56.084
including
the 13th clan.

22:57.085 --> 22:57.961
No.

23:00.339 --> 23:01.840
Come on. Come on.
Almost there.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.677
We'll give you guns

23:05.886 --> 23:07.679
and show you
how to use them.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.892
- Got it.
- Oh, good job.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.437
- What now?
- Now we wait.

23:15.645 --> 23:16.855
Trikru accepts this?

23:17.064 --> 23:18.607
They're not
happy about it.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.526
Not much they can do now,
though, is there,

23:22.694 --> 23:23.987
without an army.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.619
You were there.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.663
Then you know why
everyone hates Skaikru

23:34.206 --> 23:36.041
and why we can never
accept your terms.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.460
The alternative is war.
Is that what you want?

23:38.668 --> 23:40.379
No one wants war.

23:42.172 --> 23:44.883
Lay down your guns, and
we'll let your children live.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.472
His breathing
is still too shallow.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.890
You said his
lungs were fine.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.350
No. I said
I thought so.

23:53.558 --> 23:54.601
It's possible
a bone fragment

23:54.768 --> 23:56.603
could've lodged
in the tissue.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.647
I'll give you
time to decide.

23:58.855 --> 23:59.689
Hey...

24:01.233 --> 24:02.859
I wasn't done
talking.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.361
Uh!

24:04.986 --> 24:06.071
Ooh!

24:07.864 --> 24:09.324
You are now.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.034
Screw this.

24:12.577 --> 24:13.829
- Come on.
- It's time to go.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.414
No. He needs
more time.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.541
If Roan doesn't wake up,
we're all dead.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.626
Guns on the ground,
or he dies.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.629
We disarm,
we're done.

24:26.591 --> 24:27.884
Abby'll come through.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.720
Do what she says.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.764
Guns on
the ground now.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.106
- They're here.
- Back door.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.357
I have to close,
or he'll bleed out.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.443
No. We have to go,
or we'll bleed out.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.278
- This is gonna have to do.
- Good job.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.071
Go.

24:54.995 --> 24:55.787
Uh!

25:07.507 --> 25:09.759
No. We were trying
to save him.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.146
Oh...

25:26.985 --> 25:29.821
Roan, help us.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.239
Tell them
we're friends.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.868
You shouldn't try
to stand so soon.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.329
Where
is Ontari?

25:37.704 --> 25:39.998
Dead, sire,
killed by them.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.710
We couldn't save her,

25:43.919 --> 25:46.171
but we did what
we came here to do.

25:47.255 --> 25:49.633
Now I need you
to honor your promise

25:49.841 --> 25:50.717
to protect my people.

25:50.926 --> 25:52.928
Yeah. That was before
your people shot me

25:53.136 --> 25:54.012
and killed
my commander.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.306
We just saved
your damn life.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.312
Roan, your people
are hungry

26:02.521 --> 26:03.772
for you to lead them.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.358
Do so now as your
mother would have.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.110
Kill Wanheda.

26:09.319 --> 26:12.989
Take her power and
rule over everything.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.132
Ah..

26:32.300 --> 26:34.427
- That was something.
- I know.

26:37.013 --> 26:39.099
- Oh...
- Ooh.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.059
Ahh...

26:42.060 --> 26:42.894
Hey, look.

26:43.103 --> 26:46.481
Um, now that everybody's
coming back, I just--

26:47.107 --> 26:48.066
I don't want you
to think

26:48.275 --> 26:49.901
that I expect
anything.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.447
Uh, what if I do?

26:57.450 --> 26:59.369
Well, yeah.
That'd be good, too.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.664
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:03.707 --> 27:04.791
OK.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.214
Sorry.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.591
Knocking's not
your thing, is it?

27:12.799 --> 27:14.175
Get dressed and meet
me in engineering.

27:14.926 --> 27:15.719
Why?
What's wrong?

27:16.636 --> 27:17.929
We're all
gonna die.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.643
Oh, I'll get Jasper.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.068

27:32.277 --> 27:35.905

28:07.228 --> 28:08.271
Jasper.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.567
One second.

28:22.869 --> 28:23.745
What were you doing?

28:23.953 --> 28:26.706
Uh, no--nothing.
Sleeping.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.167
Raven needs us
in engineering.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.627
Let's go.

28:38.635 --> 28:40.762
After the second
Fukushima disaster,

28:41.137 --> 28:43.431
panacea power patented
a failsafe system

28:43.682 --> 28:45.016
with multiple
redundancies.

28:45.809 --> 28:48.687
By 2048, two dozen
mega reactors

28:48.895 --> 28:50.605
were built to withstand
any disaster,

28:51.523 --> 28:52.857
even a nuclear
attack.

28:53.233 --> 28:54.359
But that's good,
right?

28:54.609 --> 28:55.568
There's
always a catch.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.528
The plants
were built to be

28:56.736 --> 28:58.196
self-sustaining
for a hundred years.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.240
So the warranty
just ran out.

29:04.494 --> 29:05.578
This is us.

29:05.954 --> 29:06.830
Yes.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.290
It's been yellow
since we've landed.

29:09.499 --> 29:10.750
Yellow
we can handle--

29:10.959 --> 29:12.752
our bodies
adapted in space--

29:12.961 --> 29:15.255
but it's rising when
it should be falling,

29:15.463 --> 29:16.798
and when
it hits red--

29:17.006 --> 29:18.174
we're dead.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.345
Uh, how long?

29:22.721 --> 29:24.389
At the current rate
of increase,

29:25.390 --> 29:26.683
6 months,

29:27.392 --> 29:29.269
but it'll be bad
way before that.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.273
Can we stop it?

29:34.023 --> 29:34.941
No.

29:40.447 --> 29:41.573
Huh.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.033
Ha ha ha!

29:45.410 --> 29:47.078
Ha ha ha!

29:48.037 --> 29:50.623
Oh...Oh, man.

29:54.377 --> 29:56.504
I'm gonna watch
the sunrise.

30:04.095 --> 30:06.306
Wanheda and her friends
are locked up.

30:06.723 --> 30:08.433
The rest of Skaikru
appears to have fled,

30:08.975 --> 30:10.018
but we're ready
to ride them down

30:10.226 --> 30:11.269
on your command.

30:13.605 --> 30:14.814
Not yet.

30:17.817 --> 30:18.943
Forgive me
for saying so,

30:19.152 --> 30:20.195
but we can't afford
for our people

30:20.403 --> 30:22.030
to think
you're weak.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.451
Mmph...

30:29.788 --> 30:31.331
Call me weak again.

30:31.539 --> 30:32.791
I meant
no offense.

30:33.249 --> 30:34.542
Yeah, you did.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.546
Say your piece.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.884
You haven't been home
in more than 3 years.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.470
You act as if that
was my choice.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.096
Of course it wasn't.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.891
You were
a bargaining chip.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.435
It almost broke your
mother to send you away.

30:52.644 --> 30:53.645
Huh.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.649
Killing Lexa
in Soulou Gonplei

30:57.857 --> 31:00.068
was to be your
triumphant return,

31:00.485 --> 31:01.945
but you lost.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.905
Our war chiefs
don't respect you.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.826
Then I'll get
new war chiefs.

31:08.910 --> 31:12.121
The army is loyal
to them, not you.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.000
And who are you
loyal to...

31:18.044 --> 31:19.254
Spy?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.508
I'm loyal
to my clan,

31:25.051 --> 31:26.427
to my king.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.474
Let me serve you.

31:33.184 --> 31:36.354
I can help you do what
your mother never could,

31:37.313 --> 31:38.857
what Ontari
never could.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.987
- Rule everything.
- Yes.

31:45.697 --> 31:48.700
Trikru is weak
and ready to fall,

31:49.033 --> 31:51.536
and Skaikru is more
hated than ever.

31:52.495 --> 31:55.540
Give the order to
take them both out,

31:56.374 --> 31:58.084
and our war chiefs
will follow you.

32:00.128 --> 32:02.755
Show them Wanheda's head
while you do it,

32:04.632 --> 32:06.092
and they will
worship you.

32:14.183 --> 32:17.437
Bring honor to your
grandfather's crown.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.428
I know that look.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.479
I loved her, mom.

33:05.443 --> 33:06.819
I know.

33:16.329 --> 33:17.580
Wanheda,
on your feet.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.249
Where's the king?

33:24.087 --> 33:26.464
Hey, I need
to see Roan.

33:26.673 --> 33:27.715
- Uh!
- Hey. Hey!

33:27.924 --> 33:29.092
- No!
- Hey!

33:29.300 --> 33:31.344
- Wait! No! No!
- Wait! Echo! Echo!

33:31.552 --> 33:33.721
- Wait!
- Echo, listen to me.

33:33.930 --> 33:36.349
- Where are you taking her.
- Echo! Uh!

33:36.766 --> 33:38.059
Echo!

33:52.115 --> 33:53.324
No.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.368
- Sire--
- get out.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.419
It's always
something with you,

34:04.877 --> 34:06.004
isn't it?

34:06.212 --> 34:07.672
Roan, we need
your help.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.716
Well, this
should be good.

34:09.924 --> 34:11.467
Something's coming,

34:11.884 --> 34:13.845
something unlike anything
we've seen before.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.471
What's coming?

34:15.722 --> 34:18.016
You know the fire
that ended the world.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.852
Lexa called it
Praimfaya.

34:21.269 --> 34:23.563
It'll be like that,
a wave of radiation

34:23.771 --> 34:25.481
that'll kill
everything in its path.

34:32.113 --> 34:35.241
Our ancestors
survived Praimfaya,

34:35.825 --> 34:36.659
and so will we.

34:36.868 --> 34:39.996
No, you won't,
not this time,

34:40.329 --> 34:41.330
not without us.

34:53.926 --> 34:54.927
Look.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.430
I don't know
if we can stop it,

34:57.889 --> 34:59.766
but if we can't,
all of us will be dead

34:59.974 --> 35:01.434
in 6 months.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.811
Science
is our only hope.

35:04.228 --> 35:07.440
Please, honor
Lexa's coalition.

35:07.899 --> 35:09.901
Recognize Skaikru
as the 13th clan

35:10.109 --> 35:12.487
so we can go home
and come up with a way

35:12.695 --> 35:15.865
for us to survive,
all of us.

35:19.118 --> 35:20.495
Listen to that.

35:21.579 --> 35:25.291
I let you live, I'll
be dead in 6 days,

35:26.167 --> 35:27.710
not 6 months.

35:28.586 --> 35:31.464
Sorry. Can't.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.591
Jus drein jus daun!

35:33.800 --> 35:36.135
Jus drein jus daun!

35:36.344 --> 35:38.554
Jus drein
jus daun!

35:38.763 --> 35:41.265
Jus drein jus daun!

35:41.474 --> 35:43.726
Jus drein
jus daun!

35:43.935 --> 35:45.978
Jus drein jus daun!

35:46.187 --> 35:47.522
Jus drein...

35:47.939 --> 35:49.398
I'll give you this.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.821
We were told
it was lost.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.741
You give me one good
reason why I shouldn't

35:58.950 --> 35:59.992
just take that and
cut your head off.

36:00.201 --> 36:03.412
I just gave you one,
and you know

36:03.621 --> 36:04.747
I wouldn't be
offering this

36:04.956 --> 36:06.707
unless what I was
saying were true.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.254
Take it.

36:11.629 --> 36:14.173
The clans will follow you.
That's what you want.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.050
I want what's best
for my people,

36:16.259 --> 36:17.218
same as you.

36:17.426 --> 36:19.595
Then help me
save them.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.514
Roan, listen to me.

36:22.056 --> 36:23.850
You wanted
an ice nation commander.

36:24.308 --> 36:26.144
With this, you control
who ascends.

36:26.644 --> 36:28.646
There will never be
a commander to rule

36:28.855 --> 36:30.982
over Azgeda unless
you allow it.

36:57.175 --> 37:00.052
I know you've all
come here for an execution,

37:00.428 --> 37:03.347
but no one else
will die here today.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.892
The city of light has fallen...

37:08.477 --> 37:11.397
And there is no commander
left to rule us.

37:11.981 --> 37:14.108
Until another Nightblood
ascends,

37:15.026 --> 37:17.153
I--King Roan of Azgeda,

37:17.695 --> 37:19.614
eldest son of Nia,

37:20.156 --> 37:21.866
grandson of Theo--

37:22.491 --> 37:24.994
am caretaker of the throne

37:25.912 --> 37:29.207
and keeper of the flame.

37:39.091 --> 37:43.512
Until another ascends,
Azgeda honors and will defend

37:43.721 --> 37:46.015
the coalition
of the last true commander--

37:46.224 --> 37:50.228
Lexa Kom Trikru,
including the 13th clan.

37:54.732 --> 37:58.236
Let it be known
that an attack against Skaikru

37:58.444 --> 38:00.571
is an attack against us all.

38:17.171 --> 38:18.214
From your king.

38:19.173 --> 38:20.049
With this,
you'll be safe

38:20.258 --> 38:21.926
in any of our lands.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.557
You think
we'll ever be able

38:28.766 --> 38:30.142
to trust
each other again?

38:30.977 --> 38:32.228
I doubt it.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.234
Welcome back
to the coalition.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.073
Time to go.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.035
We'll do our best

38:48.244 --> 38:49.829
to keep the king
on his throne.

38:50.037 --> 38:51.872
We'll find a way to
beat the radiation.

38:52.415 --> 38:54.542
If either of you
screw this up, we die.

38:57.086 --> 38:57.920
No pressure.

38:58.129 --> 38:59.755
This is serious, o.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.717
If anyone finds out
why Roan helped us,

39:02.925 --> 39:04.885
it'll be every clan
for itself.

39:05.094 --> 39:07.555
The king will fall,
and they'll come after us.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.269
It's getting dark.
Let's do this.

39:16.355 --> 39:18.399
- May we meet again.
- May we meet again.

39:20.943 --> 39:22.445
You turn the page.

39:24.613 --> 39:27.658
You turn the page,
and you don't look back.

39:27.867 --> 39:30.077
You do better today
than you did yesterday.

39:30.578 --> 39:31.579
You understand?

39:33.497 --> 39:34.915
Before you know it,

39:36.709 --> 39:38.294
you'll deserve
to survive.

39:40.713 --> 39:41.922
I hope so.

39:56.771 --> 39:59.148
The youth
inherited the earth.

40:00.149 --> 40:02.193
And they have
6 months to save it.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.869
OK, princess.
What now?

40:14.163 --> 40:16.207
Now we survive.

40:33.724 --> 40:35.101
Huh. Hey.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.489
Uh!

40:55.871 --> 40:58.791
Ah! Aah!

40:58.999 --> 41:01.710
Aah! Aah!

41:01.919 --> 41:05.172
Aah!
