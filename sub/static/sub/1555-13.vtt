00:03.797 --> 00:05.130
I'll take it from here.

00:14.674 --> 00:16.373
Where's Shaw?

00:16.376 --> 00:19.044
Sameen risked everything
at the stock exchange.

00:19.046 --> 00:20.711
You think she's dead.

00:20.713 --> 00:22.880
What's our final destination?

00:22.882 --> 00:25.316
I've traced the truck
to these new coordinates

00:25.318 --> 00:29.787
to what looks like
a small town upstate.

00:29.789 --> 00:31.155
We're late.

00:31.157 --> 00:34.292
66 hours.
A rescue's overdue.

00:34.294 --> 00:35.759
Sameen's gonna kill us.

00:35.761 --> 00:37.494
Well, she can't fault us
for lack of effort.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.164
You've caused mayhem
over five states.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.932
<i>And we only have one clue</i>
<i>to show for it.</i>

00:41.934 --> 00:44.267
One clue is plenty.
It narrows focus.

00:44.269 --> 00:46.070
If she's in the truck.

00:46.072 --> 00:47.671
<i>We find the
truck, we find Sameen.</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:49.940
Don't give up on her, Harold.

00:49.942 --> 00:52.809
I haven't lost hope.

00:52.811 --> 00:55.445
So this is where
the truck disappeared?

00:55.447 --> 00:56.979
<i>Maple, New York.</i>

00:56.981 --> 00:59.216
Remember, our enemy is watching.

00:59.218 --> 01:00.850
And beyond the reach
of our mesh net,

01:00.852 --> 01:04.387
we need to speak with discretion
and tread carefully.

01:04.388 --> 01:06.789
What's today's cover?

01:06.791 --> 01:09.391
Detective Alice Ginsburg.

01:09.393 --> 01:11.794
You got a new partner, Columbo.

01:11.796 --> 01:13.295
Lionel's gonna love that.

01:13.297 --> 01:15.198
Oh, that reminds me.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.666
I need to ask his assistance.

01:17.668 --> 01:18.701
Good luck.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.203
And please...

01:20.205 --> 01:21.637
be safe.

01:21.639 --> 01:23.139
We will, Harold.

01:41.023 --> 01:42.824
Detective?

01:42.826 --> 01:44.826
Sorry to just drop in.

01:44.828 --> 01:45.961
What's the news?

01:45.963 --> 01:47.162
Sadly, none.

01:47.164 --> 01:48.429
How are you holding up?

01:48.431 --> 01:50.632
Just dandy.

01:50.634 --> 01:51.900
Got the captain on my ass

01:51.902 --> 01:54.236
about the absence
of my partner.

01:54.238 --> 01:56.437
Tap dancing as fast as I can.

01:56.439 --> 01:58.439
Well, I'm sure
you're quite busy.

01:58.441 --> 02:00.275
Hey, Glasses.

02:00.277 --> 02:02.109
You didn't come here to check
on my mental health, did you?

02:02.111 --> 02:04.945
No, there was a small matter,
but I can take care of it.

02:04.947 --> 02:07.749
It one of those people
needs saving?

02:07.751 --> 02:09.383
I'm all over it.

02:09.386 --> 02:10.884
I don't want to distract you.

02:13.455 --> 02:14.655
I need some air anyway.

02:14.657 --> 02:15.722
Can't breathe in here.

02:32.173 --> 02:34.474
Unless Samaritan likes
hot chocolate and cider,

02:34.476 --> 02:36.676
we might've taken a wrong turn.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.678
We haven't.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.516
The Founders' Day committee
would like to thank everyone

02:42.518 --> 02:44.684
involved in putting on
this fair,

02:44.686 --> 02:46.920
especially Mayor Dowd.

02:48.490 --> 02:53.826
Today we celebrate 212 years
of history in Maple,

02:53.828 --> 02:57.163
the biggest little
manufacturing hub in upstate.

02:59.767 --> 03:02.001
Town could use
a better tagline.

03:02.003 --> 03:03.702
When you kidnapped Finch,

03:03.704 --> 03:06.104
the Machine helped me
to find you.

03:06.106 --> 03:07.606
We should ask it for a clue.

03:07.608 --> 03:09.107
I did.

03:09.109 --> 03:11.143
She doesn't know
anything more than we do.

03:11.145 --> 03:13.812
There's only two roads
into and out of Maple.

03:13.814 --> 03:16.882
Local PD should have security
footage from the toll booths.

03:16.884 --> 03:19.317
I don't see why Samaritan
would have spirited Shaw

03:19.319 --> 03:20.686
all the way
out to Pleasantville.

03:20.688 --> 03:23.155
Don't judge a town
by its cider.

03:23.157 --> 03:25.223
<i>Monsters love small towns.</i>

03:36.735 --> 03:39.003
Have you found
him yet, Detective?

03:40.105 --> 03:41.539
Yeah.

03:41.541 --> 03:43.107
<i>Some schlub here with a tyke.</i>

03:43.109 --> 03:45.543
The man is Albert Weiss.

03:45.545 --> 03:49.213
He's a sales associate at the
Prime Hardware in Jersey City.

03:49.215 --> 03:52.149
<i>He's in town</i>
<i>to visit his niece, Rosie.</i>

03:52.151 --> 03:54.618
This guy's a puppy
that's been kicked too often.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.687
<i>Who'd want to kill</i>
<i>a sad sack like that?</i>

04:01.560 --> 04:02.759
Glasses,

04:02.761 --> 04:04.962
someone else
got eyes on this guy.

04:04.964 --> 04:06.730
Remember Dani Silva?

04:06.732 --> 04:11.602
Detective Silva
is watching Mr. Weiss?

04:11.604 --> 04:13.403
Perhaps she has
some information.

04:13.405 --> 04:15.371
She's IA.

04:15.373 --> 04:18.108
Even if I wasn't in your league
of misfits, I'd steer clear.

04:22.279 --> 04:24.114
Ah, damn it.

04:27.784 --> 04:29.552
Hey!

04:29.554 --> 04:31.321
Catching some sun in the park?

04:33.290 --> 04:35.791
You on a job,
or you playing hooky, Fusco?

04:35.793 --> 04:37.393
What, are you gonna
write me up?

04:37.395 --> 04:39.028
Nah.

04:39.030 --> 04:40.296
I'm out of Internal Affairs.

04:40.298 --> 04:43.666
I transferred to Gang Division.

04:43.668 --> 04:45.601
<i>You here for that guy?</i>

04:45.603 --> 04:47.603
He's in some kind
of trouble, right?

04:47.605 --> 04:50.640
I think so.

04:50.642 --> 04:53.542
Weiss shows up in a couple
cold missing person cases.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.977
He's on
two different witness lists.

04:54.979 --> 04:56.411
Cases are years apart.

04:56.413 --> 04:58.748
Maybe he stumbled
across something,

04:58.750 --> 05:00.682
knows too much
for his own good.

05:02.418 --> 05:04.353
Whatever he's into,
it's bad news.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.560
We need to take a
look at your security tapes.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.762
Chief, NYPD here to see you.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.769
Someone didn't join
the Mickey Mouse Club.

05:20.771 --> 05:22.937
The hell brings NYPD here?

05:22.939 --> 05:24.773
We're investigating a homicide.

05:24.775 --> 05:26.641
That so?

05:26.643 --> 05:28.309
Nothing like that in Maple.

05:28.311 --> 05:30.078
Triple homicide in Brooklyn.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.147
Perp fled this way
in a refrigerated truck.

05:32.149 --> 05:34.048
We need to check
your surveillance tapes,

05:34.050 --> 05:35.449
see if he passed through.

05:35.451 --> 05:36.850
<i>A truck, huh?</i>

05:36.852 --> 05:38.752
If that's all right with you.

05:40.656 --> 05:41.789
Chief Wicker.

05:44.092 --> 05:46.260
Call me Wick.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.395
Come on, then.

05:56.437 --> 05:57.470
<i>Look at you.</i>

05:57.472 --> 05:59.272
Some kind of whiz kid?

05:59.274 --> 06:01.108
I'm good with computers.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.376
Huh.
I got skills too.

06:03.378 --> 06:06.379
You ever fired
a Remington 870P shotgun?

06:06.381 --> 06:08.682
Fight between a computer
and one of those,

06:08.684 --> 06:10.283
I'll tell you which would win.

06:11.353 --> 06:13.253
Boom.

06:16.857 --> 06:19.693
Serious stuff
for a peaceful town.

06:19.695 --> 06:20.827
Oh.

06:20.829 --> 06:24.897
Wick loves his guns.

06:24.899 --> 06:26.999
You know, Wick had
a scandal a while back.

06:27.001 --> 06:28.000
Abuse of power.

06:28.002 --> 06:29.368
But last summer,

06:29.370 --> 06:30.903
the mayor jumped him
all the way to chief.

06:30.905 --> 06:33.239
Lucky son of a gun.

06:33.241 --> 06:35.875
Huh.

06:35.877 --> 06:37.476
Hey, some kids are outside

06:37.478 --> 06:40.145
spraying graffiti
on those patrol cars.

06:40.147 --> 06:41.513
What?

06:45.785 --> 06:47.319
Hmm.

06:47.321 --> 06:50.122
One piece of footage
is corrupted.

06:50.124 --> 06:52.858
I'm gonna need to take a look
at the hard backups.

06:52.860 --> 06:55.327
The DVDs are locked in storage.

06:55.329 --> 06:59.330
You want 'em, you're gonna
have to let me in on the case...

06:59.332 --> 07:01.099
over drinks.

07:02.935 --> 07:04.435
Well, sure.

07:04.437 --> 07:06.138
If I can find the time.

07:07.941 --> 07:10.175
Don't be coy.

07:10.177 --> 07:13.544
I don't like coy.

07:16.215 --> 07:17.682
Coy's not my thing either.

07:25.758 --> 07:28.058
I never thought I'd say this...

07:30.762 --> 07:32.696
but you got to be more careful.

07:35.767 --> 07:37.067
You found the truck.

07:37.069 --> 07:39.569
It entered Maple
and never left.

07:39.571 --> 07:43.774
Shaw's still here in town.

07:43.776 --> 07:46.777
Hold on, Shaw.

07:46.779 --> 07:49.179
We're close.

07:50.319 --> 07:53.378
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

08:01.945 --> 08:03.979
Welcome to Maple.

08:03.981 --> 08:05.347
What brings you to town?

08:05.349 --> 08:07.716
Catching up with a friend.

08:07.718 --> 08:09.318
<i>How long you two</i>
<i>had this place?</i>

08:09.320 --> 08:11.019
<i>Laura bought it</i>
<i>a half year ago.</i>

08:11.021 --> 08:13.422
- Larry, go help her with that.
- Oh.

08:13.424 --> 08:14.823
I'm fine.

08:14.825 --> 08:16.625
This doesn't weigh a thing.

08:18.161 --> 08:19.695
You sure I
can't give you a hand?

08:19.697 --> 08:21.363
Thanks.
I'd rather not be disturbed.

08:21.365 --> 08:23.198
I've got business to attend to.

08:25.101 --> 08:26.201
<i>You elevate
abduction to an art.</i>

08:27.904 --> 08:30.905
Always travel
with an empty suitcase.

08:30.907 --> 08:32.907
Never know what
you might pick up.

08:32.909 --> 08:35.109
Yeah, but anyone who realizes
the chief is gone,

08:35.111 --> 08:36.344
<i>they're gonna come</i>
<i>looking for us.</i>

08:36.346 --> 08:37.378
<i>We're fighting a clock now.</i>

08:37.380 --> 08:39.714
We're already on a clock.

08:39.716 --> 08:41.982
The longer it takes us
to find Sameen...

08:44.820 --> 08:47.421
Our rival hid the truck footage.

08:47.423 --> 08:51.091
Maybe they're hiding
something else.

08:51.093 --> 08:53.193
Your surveillance.

08:53.195 --> 08:56.296
Any other footage corrupted
in the last couple of days?

08:56.298 --> 08:57.832
I don't know who the hell
you think you are,

08:57.834 --> 08:58.832
but you two better hope--

08:58.834 --> 09:01.134
Answer the question, Chief.

09:01.136 --> 09:04.504
Setup's buggy,
video disappears time to time.

09:04.506 --> 09:06.073
Not recently, though.

09:06.075 --> 09:07.540
When footage is corrupted,

09:07.542 --> 09:10.077
is it concentrated
to a geographic area?

09:10.079 --> 09:11.811
How should I know?

09:11.813 --> 09:13.146
What's this got to do
with anything in my juris--

09:13.148 --> 09:15.114
You talk so much
and say so little.

09:15.116 --> 09:16.416
<i>I found the truck.</i>

09:16.418 --> 09:18.084
It has an eagle-shaped
hood ornament.

09:18.086 --> 09:20.453
I spoke to a rest stop waitress
who had seen it.

09:20.455 --> 09:21.721
It was abandoned
three days ago.

09:21.723 --> 09:22.856
It's been impounded.

09:22.858 --> 09:25.157
Let's move...

09:25.159 --> 09:29.028
as soon as I make Wick
more comfortable.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.635
Here's a list of the missing
person cases by date.

09:36.637 --> 09:37.770
I got Weiss'
credit card statements

09:37.772 --> 09:39.171
for the last eight years,

09:39.173 --> 09:42.508
extracted the days
that he was in town.

09:42.510 --> 09:45.878
What?
I got 'em from a friend.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.480
No one's got your back
on this one, huh?

09:48.482 --> 09:50.582
No, I don't have
departmental approval.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.684
One of the missing persons
was my witness.

09:52.686 --> 09:54.420
I got to find out
what happened.

09:54.422 --> 09:56.388
Dog with a bone.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.556
You'll make a good detective,

09:57.558 --> 10:00.459
terrible spouse.

10:00.461 --> 10:02.494
Nine times,
Weiss was in the city.

10:02.496 --> 10:04.996
Nine times, the dates
match missing persons.

10:04.998 --> 10:06.264
That's more
than just a pattern.

10:06.266 --> 10:07.698
No way.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.134
This guy's scared
of his own shadow.

10:09.136 --> 10:10.535
You think
he's the angel of death?

10:10.537 --> 10:11.970
I don't know, he worked
at a hardware store.

10:11.972 --> 10:13.271
Wouldn't be hard for him

10:13.273 --> 10:14.439
to get materials
to make bodies go away.

10:14.441 --> 10:15.873
Come on.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.742
This guy wouldn't murder a fly.

10:21.346 --> 10:23.648
100 pounds of lye was stolen
from his hardware store

10:23.650 --> 10:25.450
a few years ago.

10:25.452 --> 10:27.585
That would disappear, well...

10:27.587 --> 10:29.821
a whole lot of bodies.

10:29.823 --> 10:32.623
All the victims
had gang connections.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.159
I'm thinking murder for hire.

10:35.161 --> 10:37.461
So you're saying
that gangs paid this guy

10:37.463 --> 10:39.596
to take out sensitive targets?

10:39.598 --> 10:41.365
I think it's perfect.

10:41.367 --> 10:44.368
He looks more like a Maytag man
than he does a hit man.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.702
<i>You'd never see him coming.</i>

10:45.704 --> 10:47.804
Works clean.
He's never been caught.

10:47.806 --> 10:50.007
So gangs start using him
as a freelancer.

10:50.009 --> 10:51.541
So if he's back in town,

10:51.543 --> 10:55.779
that means some sap's
about to take a bath in lye.

10:55.781 --> 10:56.847
I'm coming with.

10:56.849 --> 10:57.881
Weiss killed my witness.

10:57.883 --> 10:59.583
Thanks, but I got this.

10:59.585 --> 11:01.485
Look,
if we're right about this,

11:01.487 --> 11:03.854
you're in over your head
with this guy.

11:03.856 --> 11:06.523
You got to deal with me.

11:06.525 --> 11:08.124
I think I know where he is.

11:10.227 --> 11:12.862
You got a nicer tie?

11:12.864 --> 11:14.130
What?
It's my lucky tie.

11:26.576 --> 11:28.243
<i>Hey, eyes on the road.</i>

11:28.245 --> 11:30.679
Keep your mind on navigating.

11:30.681 --> 11:33.883
Can't afford to lose
any more time.

11:33.885 --> 11:37.686
You really are sure
she's alive.

11:37.688 --> 11:39.722
You know
about Schrodinger's cat?

11:42.526 --> 11:46.694
There's a cat trapped in a box
with something lethal.

11:46.696 --> 11:48.997
There's a 50% chance
the cat's been killed,

11:48.999 --> 11:50.598
but until you open the box,

11:50.600 --> 11:52.700
there's no way to know
one way or the other.

11:52.702 --> 11:55.003
Quantum physics says
before you open the box,

11:55.005 --> 11:58.006
the cat isn't dead or alive.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.307
It's both.

11:59.309 --> 12:01.308
What about
after you open the box?

12:01.310 --> 12:04.712
Reality collapses
back onto itself.

12:04.714 --> 12:06.213
Cat's either alive,
or it's dead.

12:08.717 --> 12:11.385
Well, we're gonna
see reality soon.

12:11.387 --> 12:13.621
But you don't bet against Shaw.

12:13.623 --> 12:14.989
No.

12:17.292 --> 12:19.193
Nothing kills that cat.

12:31.106 --> 12:32.873
Guy's truck's out back.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.507
Something bothering you?

12:34.509 --> 12:39.079
No, just you clean up nice.
Who would have thunk?

12:39.081 --> 12:40.681
So what's Weiss doing here?

12:40.683 --> 12:41.949
High tea.

12:47.956 --> 12:50.022
Weiss brought his niece here
for the past two days.

12:50.024 --> 12:52.492
I think he's casing a target.

12:52.494 --> 12:54.227
All his previous victims
have disappeared

12:54.229 --> 12:57.163
from their workplaces.

13:00.434 --> 13:02.102
Left his niece at home.

13:02.104 --> 13:05.138
He's about to make his move.

13:05.140 --> 13:07.039
<i>Who's his mark?</i>

13:13.313 --> 13:16.716
Oh, it's my mother.
I got to take this.

13:16.718 --> 13:17.984
Hey, how's your back, Ma?

13:17.986 --> 13:18.985
Your mother?

13:18.987 --> 13:20.486
Honestly, Detective.

13:20.488 --> 13:21.787
The restaurant employs

13:21.789 --> 13:23.388
one waiter
with gang connections,

13:23.390 --> 13:25.056
Marcus Young.

13:25.058 --> 13:28.127
He lives in territory
controlled by the 280 gang.

13:28.129 --> 13:30.329
<i>Perhaps another gang</i>
<i>wants him to disappear.</i>

13:30.331 --> 13:31.830
You think a banger works here?

13:36.302 --> 13:37.902
<i>He's here.</i>
<i>Got to go.</i>

13:42.942 --> 13:44.609
That's Weiss' target.

13:53.318 --> 13:54.786
Whoa.
No need for violence.

13:54.788 --> 13:56.420
All right, we're having tea,
remember?

13:56.422 --> 13:57.688
Bullets go great with tea.

13:57.690 --> 13:58.689
No, let's do this the easy way.

13:58.691 --> 14:00.024
Let me handle it, please.

14:17.575 --> 14:19.710
<i>Hands in the sky.</i>

14:21.780 --> 14:23.380
You talking to me, Detective?

14:23.382 --> 14:26.183
What are you doing in here?

14:26.185 --> 14:27.617
I was told the bathroom
was this way.

14:27.619 --> 14:29.152
You're under arrest
for trespassing.

14:29.154 --> 14:30.820
What?
It was an honest mistake.

14:30.822 --> 14:32.189
I didn't do anything.

14:32.191 --> 14:33.856
Yeah, you did.
You resisted arrest.

14:33.858 --> 14:35.725
Come on, let's
give them some air.

14:35.727 --> 14:38.662
What's going on here?

14:38.664 --> 14:39.729
Ow.

14:39.731 --> 14:40.797
What the hell are you doing?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.667
Please, no!

14:43.669 --> 14:46.235
I'll do anything you say,
just don't hurt me again.

14:50.908 --> 14:52.208
We've arrived, Harold.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.776
Let's hope the truck is here.

14:53.778 --> 14:57.546
<i>Please be careful.</i>

14:57.548 --> 14:59.015
Thanks for letting us in.

14:59.017 --> 15:01.117
I don't care, dude.
Go to town.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.022
Guy reeks of tequila,
and it's 3:00 PM.

15:07.024 --> 15:10.292
Looks like Founders' Day
is the new Cinco de Mayo.

15:10.294 --> 15:12.695
<i>His name is Mason Bauer,</i>

15:12.697 --> 15:15.431
<i>deadbeat trust funder</i>

15:15.433 --> 15:17.399
whose fund crashed
four months ago.

15:17.401 --> 15:19.567
This is the first job he's had.

15:19.569 --> 15:23.338
We're here with Willy
Clark, the luckiest guy in Maple.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.940
What are you gonna do
with the money?

15:24.942 --> 15:26.441
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

15:26.443 --> 15:28.176
<i>But I knew today</i>
<i>was gonna be great.</i>

15:28.178 --> 15:29.677
If I was Mason,
I'd be drinking too.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.080
Homeless man
just hit the jackpot.

15:32.082 --> 15:34.015
Luck is in the air.

15:40.756 --> 15:41.756
That's our truck.

15:47.663 --> 15:48.863
Did you find her?

15:50.266 --> 15:51.799
She's not in the truck.

16:01.209 --> 16:05.880
This is a medical drill
and saw.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.114
Lost a lot of blood.

16:08.116 --> 16:09.483
<i>Maybe they were</i>
<i>trying to save her,</i>

16:09.485 --> 16:12.018
<i>but this doesn't look good.</i>

16:25.645 --> 16:28.746
I'm so sorry, John, Samantha.

16:28.748 --> 16:30.547
It's not over yet.
We'll find her.

16:30.549 --> 16:32.617
The truck came here
for a reason.

16:32.619 --> 16:34.485
<i>Were they taking Sameen</i>
<i>to a hospital?</i>

16:34.487 --> 16:36.220
I've already hacked
the hospital's server.

16:36.222 --> 16:38.822
They haven't admitted anyone
with her injuries.

16:38.824 --> 16:40.524
Why would agents
shoot Sameen in the head

16:40.526 --> 16:42.259
only to try to patch her up?

16:42.261 --> 16:44.595
Our enemy has strange methods.

16:44.597 --> 16:46.396
It found a use for her.

16:46.398 --> 16:48.398
Does the hospital
have a neurosurgeon?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
I'm sending you his address.

16:50.402 --> 16:53.069
But please expedite
a blood sample for analysis

16:53.071 --> 16:55.839
and verify that it is Sameen's
before any heads roll.

16:55.841 --> 16:57.741
Heads won't roll yet.

16:57.743 --> 17:00.944
The people who hurt her
deserve special attention.

17:03.615 --> 17:05.414
Dr. Victor Haskell?

17:05.415 --> 17:06.549
We need to talk.

17:06.550 --> 17:07.617
Where is Sameen Shaw?

17:07.618 --> 17:09.218
I don't know who that is.

17:11.055 --> 17:13.356
You worked on her
three nights ago.

17:13.358 --> 17:15.223
<i>I haven't performed
any surgeries in months.</i>

17:15.226 --> 17:17.026
I was fired.

17:17.028 --> 17:19.362
But I got a call that night.

17:19.364 --> 17:21.263
Someone was performing
a craniotomy.

17:21.266 --> 17:22.964
He needed my advice.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.700
It wasn't going well.

17:24.702 --> 17:26.269
<i>Then he hung up.</i>
<i>I don't know who it was.</i>

17:26.271 --> 17:27.435
<i>The number was blocked.</i>

17:27.436 --> 17:28.569
Did you call the police?

17:30.473 --> 17:31.974
Why not?

17:31.976 --> 17:34.943
Bad things happen here
when you ask questions.

17:34.945 --> 17:36.244
<i>Six months ago,</i>

17:36.246 --> 17:38.547
Maple was
on the verge of collapse.

17:38.549 --> 17:41.249
80% of the town worked
for the textile factory,

17:41.251 --> 17:42.885
but business
was moving overseas.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.654
Then a corporation bought it,

17:45.656 --> 17:47.055
Carrow.

17:47.057 --> 17:48.456
Saved everyone's jobs,

17:48.458 --> 17:49.658
saved Maple.

17:49.660 --> 17:53.895
Then things changed.

17:53.897 --> 17:56.064
People protesting Carrow
were killed.

17:56.066 --> 17:57.899
In a manner.

17:57.901 --> 17:59.334
The mayor tried
to get the factory

17:59.336 --> 18:01.202
to phase out
their diesel generators.

18:01.204 --> 18:03.905
<i>Then someone</i>
<i>leaked the paper information</i>

18:03.907 --> 18:06.808
implicating the mayor
in corruption.

18:06.810 --> 18:09.911
He ended up
taking his own life.

18:09.913 --> 18:13.081
And the new mayor,
six months ago,

18:13.083 --> 18:14.481
he was a gas station attendant.

18:14.483 --> 18:16.184
What's that got to do with you?

18:24.093 --> 18:25.759
I was on the city council.

18:25.761 --> 18:28.829
I was framed
for medical malpractice.

18:28.831 --> 18:31.031
Is the factory
still in textiles?

18:31.033 --> 18:34.534
No, Ms. Thompson runs
the factory, repurposed it.

18:34.536 --> 18:36.469
<i>They make a tech thing now.</i>

18:36.471 --> 18:37.804
Transponders.

18:40.942 --> 18:42.709
We need to talk
to Ms. Thompson.

18:42.711 --> 18:44.310
This is her.

18:44.312 --> 18:47.313
We saw her speak
at the town square.

18:47.315 --> 18:49.716
You ask questions about the
factory, you'll wind up dead.

18:49.718 --> 18:51.651
She controls everything.

18:51.653 --> 18:54.520
Don't worry about us, Doctor.

18:54.522 --> 18:56.956
Samaritan runs the factory.

18:56.958 --> 18:58.458
Welcome to Maple.

19:01.528 --> 19:02.995
Won't happen again, sir.

19:02.997 --> 19:04.964
Thank you, Detective.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.841
IA told me if I go
within 100 feet of that guy,

19:15.843 --> 19:17.977
I'll be suspended.

19:17.979 --> 19:21.981
What makes a man like Mr. Weiss
become a killer?

19:21.983 --> 19:24.983
Guy like that,
living an unhappy life,

19:24.985 --> 19:27.753
answers an unorthodox
Craigslist ad,

19:27.755 --> 19:29.421
finds he likes it.

19:29.423 --> 19:32.557
Some people are called
to be killers.

19:32.559 --> 19:35.560
I found a lead.

19:35.562 --> 19:38.497
Weiss owns a home in Brooklyn
under a false name.

19:43.635 --> 19:46.271
So, um...

19:46.273 --> 19:48.173
any news?

19:48.175 --> 19:51.509
I'm afraid
things aren't looking good.

19:51.511 --> 19:53.244
We should be prepared

19:53.246 --> 19:56.213
for an unfavorable outcome.

19:57.816 --> 20:00.017
Just say it plain.

20:00.019 --> 20:01.319
She's dead, right?

20:06.591 --> 20:07.591
Hey.

20:07.593 --> 20:09.293
I got a lead.

20:09.295 --> 20:12.595
House in Brooklyn
owned by Weiss.

20:12.597 --> 20:13.864
You talk to the banger yet?

20:13.866 --> 20:15.398
He's not a banger.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.800
Checked
the Gang Division files.

20:16.802 --> 20:18.235
He's a witness.

20:18.237 --> 20:22.206
Saw a bigwig from the 280 gang
kill three guys,

20:22.208 --> 20:24.341
but he won't testify.

20:26.410 --> 20:28.411
Marcus Young?

20:28.413 --> 20:29.512
Thanks for coming in.

20:31.949 --> 20:33.115
<i>You.</i>

20:33.117 --> 20:34.784
I saw what you did to that guy.

20:34.786 --> 20:36.219
You're in danger.

20:36.221 --> 20:38.588
The 280 gang hired that guy
to shut you up.

20:38.590 --> 20:39.589
That old man?

20:39.591 --> 20:40.957
Got to be kidding me.

20:40.959 --> 20:44.627
That old man's
got a mean streak.

20:44.629 --> 20:48.430
Detective Fusco here
will take you someplace safe.

20:48.432 --> 20:50.366
I'm gonna go find that hit man.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.070
Weiss is dangerous.

20:54.072 --> 20:55.571
We need to work on this
together.

20:55.573 --> 20:57.240
You got yourself sidelined.

20:57.242 --> 21:00.176
I'm a big girl.
I can take care of myself.

21:07.418 --> 21:09.651
Watch your back, now.

21:09.653 --> 21:12.254
I'm a winner.
I'm a winner!

21:12.256 --> 21:14.289
That's Mason
from the impound lot.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.259
He shot the guy
who won the lottery.

21:17.261 --> 21:19.160
One guy's fortune
goes up in smoke.

21:19.162 --> 21:21.462
Another guy wins the lottery.

21:21.464 --> 21:23.865
Maybe Samaritan
came here for the factory,

21:23.867 --> 21:27.269
but it's expanded its grip
to the whole community.

21:27.271 --> 21:29.104
It's playing
with people's lives.

21:29.106 --> 21:30.038
Why?

21:33.009 --> 21:34.842
Look.

21:34.844 --> 21:37.678
There's our mark.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.213
Bring the car around.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.285
This is horrible.

21:44.287 --> 21:46.120
Founders' Day is ruined.

21:46.122 --> 21:49.891
For that hooligan
to do this today--

21:49.893 --> 21:52.226
I know.
I know.

23:01.303 --> 23:03.971
Oh, my God.

23:51.351 --> 23:52.952
Whoa.

23:52.954 --> 23:54.286
Where's Weiss?

23:54.288 --> 23:55.654
He must have run off.
You all right?

23:55.656 --> 23:57.623
You let him escape?

24:00.828 --> 24:02.962
Nothing useful on her phone,
Harold.

24:05.266 --> 24:07.132
Swept the B&B.
It's clean.

24:07.134 --> 24:09.235
We have to move fast.

24:09.237 --> 24:12.271
Your little voice finally
tell you something about Sameen?

24:12.273 --> 24:14.906
No, but Ms. Thompson will.

24:14.908 --> 24:16.208
<i>At a minimum, she may know</i>

24:16.210 --> 24:17.843
what our rival is making
in the factory

24:17.845 --> 24:19.778
and how it's manipulating
the people of Maple.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.447
If it re-creates this
in other cities,

24:22.449 --> 24:24.282
countless people will suffer.

24:24.284 --> 24:26.651
Right now, I only care
about one person, Harold.

24:26.653 --> 24:28.553
I'm gonna take
first swing at this.

24:28.555 --> 24:29.554
All right?

24:29.556 --> 24:30.822
You get ten minutes.

24:34.460 --> 24:35.693
I'm warning you,

24:35.695 --> 24:39.196
the police will come
looking for me.

24:39.198 --> 24:42.066
I wouldn't bet on it.

24:42.068 --> 24:44.935
I'd introduce myself,
but you already know us.

24:44.937 --> 24:46.537
What did you do with Sameen?

24:46.539 --> 24:48.038
Who?

24:48.040 --> 24:52.310
You know, little firecracker,
brown hair.

24:52.312 --> 24:54.044
I don't know who you mean.

24:54.046 --> 24:56.180
Hope you've got a good
physical therapist in town.

24:56.182 --> 24:57.815
I don't know anything.

24:57.817 --> 25:01.451
I do what I'm told.
I follow the instructions.

25:01.453 --> 25:02.753
What instructions?

25:02.755 --> 25:04.321
Emails

25:04.323 --> 25:06.490
telling me where to go,

25:06.492 --> 25:09.593
what to say,
places to leave things,

25:09.595 --> 25:11.095
find other things.

25:11.097 --> 25:13.163
I do what I'm told.

25:13.165 --> 25:15.799
I get to live a nice life.

25:15.801 --> 25:17.000
If I don't...

25:17.002 --> 25:18.368
They kill you.

25:20.405 --> 25:24.040
My real name is Maryann Holst.

25:24.042 --> 25:27.911
Six months ago, I was working
at a CVS in Pittsburgh.

25:27.913 --> 25:29.578
Had a heart attack.

25:29.580 --> 25:33.917
I woke up with a new pacemaker
at the Maple hospital.

25:33.919 --> 25:37.120
A blonde woman told me
I'd been given a new job,

25:37.122 --> 25:38.521
a second chance,

25:38.523 --> 25:41.191
but I don't know anything.

25:44.061 --> 25:45.461
You're a good liar,

25:45.463 --> 25:47.930
but I'm losing my patience now.

25:47.932 --> 25:49.432
And you don't want me
to turn you over

25:49.434 --> 25:51.834
to my colleague here.

25:51.836 --> 25:53.302
<i>She's telling the truth.</i>

25:53.304 --> 25:55.871
Maryann Holst officially died
in Pittsburgh

25:55.873 --> 25:57.440
six months ago.

25:57.442 --> 25:58.607
<i>It's her.</i>

25:58.609 --> 25:59.608
Doesn't matter.

25:59.610 --> 26:01.743
She's an agent now.

26:01.745 --> 26:03.545
I put you on a private line.

26:03.547 --> 26:06.448
John, you cannot allow Samantha
to take over the interrogation.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.550
It will lead to the torture
and possible murder

26:08.552 --> 26:10.552
of a woman
who may well be innocent.

26:10.554 --> 26:12.988
Even if she was just obeying
orders, she's responsible.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.456
Our friend is gone.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.158
I feel Sameen's loss
as acutely as you,

26:16.160 --> 26:17.726
but we can't become monsters.

26:17.728 --> 26:19.260
<i>Thompson is hiding something.</i>

26:19.262 --> 26:21.963
And if I can't
get it out of her,

26:21.965 --> 26:23.898
she can.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.401
My ears are burning.

26:26.403 --> 26:27.969
Do I get to come out and play?

26:27.971 --> 26:28.970
Please, let me try.

26:28.972 --> 26:30.037
Please?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.643
<i>Ms. Thompson, the transponders</i>
<i>you make at the factory,</i>

26:36.645 --> 26:37.912
<i>what do they do?</i>

26:37.914 --> 26:40.381
I don't know.
I swear to God.

26:40.383 --> 26:41.482
<i>Why did your supervisors</i>

26:41.484 --> 26:43.584
turn the town on its head?

26:43.586 --> 26:45.086
What is the goal?

26:45.088 --> 26:48.789
I think they want
to make people happy.

26:48.791 --> 26:52.993
I've given so many people
new jobs at the factory,

26:52.995 --> 26:54.327
jobs they're suited to.

26:54.329 --> 26:56.196
Everyone is so happy.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.131
What about Dr. Haskell
and the dead mayor?

26:58.133 --> 26:59.767
I doubt they're happy.

26:59.769 --> 27:04.004
The blonde woman told me
a few must be displaced

27:04.006 --> 27:06.273
so that the majority
may thrive.

27:06.275 --> 27:09.209
<i>Everyone rewarded</i>
<i>according to their abilities.</i>

27:09.211 --> 27:10.676
But the things
we saw today--

27:10.678 --> 27:15.348
There have been
some recent changes.

27:15.350 --> 27:18.618
Mason shooting that poor man...

27:18.620 --> 27:21.021
Things have fallen
out of balance,

27:21.023 --> 27:22.622
like we're being punished.

27:22.624 --> 27:25.024
It isn't punishment.

27:25.026 --> 27:28.227
It's studying us.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.829
Our enemy hasn't had the time

27:29.831 --> 27:31.531
to learn the intricacies
of human nature,

27:31.533 --> 27:35.535
so it's turned Maple
into its own little ant farm.

27:35.537 --> 27:40.372
<i>It took a broken town</i>
<i>and rearranged the populace.</i>

27:40.374 --> 27:43.242
First, it made things perfect.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.045
Then it decided
to see what happens

27:46.047 --> 27:48.480
if you shake the ant farm.

27:48.482 --> 27:51.250
I promise, I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.851
That's not good enough.

27:52.853 --> 27:54.320
She's our only lead.

27:54.322 --> 27:55.988
But she doesn't know anything.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.556
I haven't asked her yet.

28:00.993 --> 28:03.528
Your people used this
on our friend.

28:05.265 --> 28:06.865
Where is she?

28:06.867 --> 28:07.933
John, you have to stop her.

28:07.935 --> 28:09.033
<i>Thompson is a puppet.</i>

28:09.035 --> 28:10.168
Thompson's lying.

28:10.170 --> 28:11.169
She knows something.

28:11.171 --> 28:12.737
We are not beasts.

28:12.739 --> 28:14.705
A little beastliness
is just the thing now and then.

28:16.076 --> 28:18.076
I saw her.
I saw the brunette woman.

28:18.078 --> 28:20.078
- Please don't do this.
- Where?

28:20.080 --> 28:21.779
They were taking her
into the factory.

28:21.781 --> 28:24.048
I can help you.
I can help you get inside.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.683
<i>I'm sorry that I lied.</i>

28:25.685 --> 28:27.785
I had to.
They'll kill me.

28:27.787 --> 28:30.488
Thank you for telling us.

28:30.490 --> 28:34.091
Honesty is always
the best policy.

28:35.127 --> 28:36.126
John!

28:41.767 --> 28:43.100
Final question.

28:43.102 --> 28:46.436
You lie,
this goes in your skull.

28:46.438 --> 28:49.539
When you saw our friend...

28:49.541 --> 28:52.642
was she alive?

28:52.644 --> 28:53.576
Yes.

29:08.543 --> 29:11.311
Doesn't matter what happened or
what you saw in that basement.

29:11.313 --> 29:13.813
You broke into his house.

29:13.815 --> 29:16.282
He fired shots because he
thought his life was in danger.

29:16.284 --> 29:17.651
That's all the DA's gonna hear.

29:17.653 --> 29:19.385
There's a kill room
in that house.

29:19.387 --> 29:21.555
Yeah, if it still exists.
Good luck getting a warrant now.

29:21.557 --> 29:23.156
Well, if you hadn't
shot up the basement,

29:23.158 --> 29:24.724
maybe I would have gotten
a confession out of him.

29:24.726 --> 29:25.792
I saved your ass.

29:25.794 --> 29:27.661
I don't need you to save me.

29:31.331 --> 29:33.699
I couldn't stand
to lose someone today.

29:36.136 --> 29:39.472
Listen, I went through
the missing person cases

29:39.474 --> 29:42.575
and saw one other cop
pulled those files last year,

29:42.577 --> 29:44.610
Bill Buchanan
from Jersey City police.

29:48.147 --> 29:49.648
Then he went home

29:49.650 --> 29:52.350
and took a carbon monoxide nap
in his garage.

29:52.352 --> 29:54.587
Maybe old Billy made
the same connections we did

29:54.589 --> 29:55.854
and got a little too close,

29:55.856 --> 29:58.156
so Weiss made him disappear.

29:58.158 --> 30:00.926
And now he might want to do
the same to the both of us.

30:00.928 --> 30:02.928
I hope he tries.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.533
Here we go.

30:10.669 --> 30:13.905
Remember, one false move,
you're dead.

30:16.175 --> 30:17.209
So have fun.

30:20.379 --> 30:21.679
Evening, Ms. Thompson.

30:21.681 --> 30:23.380
Hello, Dave.

30:23.382 --> 30:26.117
What brings you around so late?

30:26.119 --> 30:30.187
Just giving my cousins a tour.

30:30.189 --> 30:31.623
Of course.

30:31.625 --> 30:32.890
Welcome to Carrow.

30:42.201 --> 30:44.301
The security suite is in here.

30:52.410 --> 30:53.810
My password is...

30:53.812 --> 30:55.445
Unnecessary.

31:02.419 --> 31:04.054
We'll have to move quickly

31:04.056 --> 31:06.657
<i>after I shut down</i>
<i>the cameras and alarms.</i>

31:06.659 --> 31:09.225
It's just
a skeleton crew tonight.

31:09.227 --> 31:10.993
It's not them
I'm worried about.

31:19.036 --> 31:20.670
Microdots.

31:20.672 --> 31:24.240
Invisible GPS trackers,
probably.

31:24.242 --> 31:26.242
They are transponders.

31:26.244 --> 31:27.843
Stick these
on your tech equipment,

31:27.845 --> 31:30.279
your kid's backpack, your keys.

31:30.281 --> 31:32.581
Carrow will keep track
of it all.

31:32.583 --> 31:36.185
That sounds useful, right?

31:36.187 --> 31:37.586
Samaritan will have

31:37.588 --> 31:41.057
constant location data
on everything.

31:41.059 --> 31:42.591
But it wouldn't have
brought Shaw here

31:42.593 --> 31:45.960
to put a tracker on her.

31:45.962 --> 31:48.063
Where did they take her?

31:48.065 --> 31:49.964
There, but I don't have access.

31:49.966 --> 31:52.067
That area's classified.

31:52.069 --> 31:53.935
You're on your own from here.

31:53.937 --> 31:55.970
When the shooting starts, duck.

33:13.147 --> 33:15.948
It's polite to knock.

33:15.950 --> 33:19.551
Hey, Weiss.

33:19.553 --> 33:21.788
You were gonna make it look
like she hung herself.

33:21.790 --> 33:22.721
Cute.

33:25.158 --> 33:27.793
I swore I'd never get caught.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.962
Yeah, well, you're gonna
have to break that promise.

33:30.964 --> 33:32.631
No, I don't think so.

34:01.393 --> 34:03.328
Here come the fireworks.

34:13.306 --> 34:15.072
<i>Today's not the
day to screw with us.</i>

34:15.074 --> 34:18.242
<i>You get one chance to run.</i>

34:18.244 --> 34:19.409
Time's up.

34:23.014 --> 34:25.114
Try to be nice,
and this is what happens.

34:25.117 --> 34:27.551
Come on, Ms. Thompson.

34:36.427 --> 34:40.630
This is
the factory's real project.

34:40.632 --> 34:42.098
These are neural implants

34:42.100 --> 34:45.534
to prevent seizures
in people with epilepsy

34:45.536 --> 34:47.971
or brain damage.

34:47.973 --> 34:49.739
But look here.

34:49.741 --> 34:51.407
Transponder.

34:51.409 --> 34:53.877
The implants can relay
information to Samaritan.

34:53.879 --> 34:55.643
Watching the people of Maple
isn't enough.

34:55.646 --> 34:58.882
It wants to study us
on an electrochemical level.

34:58.884 --> 35:01.217
They're gonna stick
one of these in Shaw.

35:01.219 --> 35:03.452
We really are just pets to it.

35:03.454 --> 35:05.220
Pets don't carry guns.

35:05.222 --> 35:06.188
Come on.

35:13.162 --> 35:14.162
Please, don't shoot.

35:16.901 --> 35:17.867
Look.

35:22.471 --> 35:23.372
Sameen?

35:31.547 --> 35:33.415
<i>John, Samantha.</i>

35:33.417 --> 35:35.683
The blood from the truck--

35:35.685 --> 35:37.151
the test came back--

35:37.153 --> 35:39.020
it isn't Sameen's.

35:41.189 --> 35:43.824
Please let me go home.

35:43.826 --> 35:46.093
Who are you?

35:46.095 --> 35:47.861
Delia Jones.

35:50.832 --> 35:52.934
You were in the truck?

35:55.037 --> 35:57.604
It was you the whole time?

36:02.311 --> 36:04.010
Have there been
any other patients here

36:04.012 --> 36:05.111
in the past three days?

36:05.113 --> 36:07.448
No, just her.

36:07.450 --> 36:10.717
We followed the wrong clues,
Finch.

36:10.719 --> 36:13.219
Why was Delia
at the stock exchange?

36:13.221 --> 36:16.722
She was a secretary there.

36:16.724 --> 36:19.125
She must have been shot
in the firefight.

36:19.127 --> 36:20.626
They got rid of the witnesses,

36:20.628 --> 36:22.528
but it seems that
they brought Delia here

36:22.530 --> 36:24.831
to test the neural implant.

36:27.134 --> 36:28.534
Root?

36:28.536 --> 36:31.003
Your friend left.

36:31.005 --> 36:33.539
She found the reinforcements.

36:33.541 --> 36:35.675
We have to take Delia with us.

36:35.677 --> 36:38.043
I need to stay behind.

36:38.045 --> 36:40.546
I'm quitting my job.

36:40.548 --> 36:42.348
Well, good luck.

36:42.350 --> 36:44.249
When they track you down,
remember this.

36:44.251 --> 36:46.085
By taking orders
without question,

36:46.087 --> 36:47.886
you've destroyed this town.

36:47.888 --> 36:49.721
You deserve
what's coming to you.

36:49.723 --> 36:51.357
John, they'll be trying
to turn the cameras back on.

36:51.359 --> 36:52.591
Hide your face.

37:28.294 --> 37:29.727
Root?

37:35.635 --> 37:37.134
Root?

37:47.546 --> 37:48.913
Good timing.

37:48.915 --> 37:50.848
Let's get out of here.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.476
_

37:57.073 --> 37:58.359
_

38:15.238 --> 38:17.306
Hey.

38:17.308 --> 38:19.642
Thanks for saving my ass.

38:19.644 --> 38:21.878
See, that's how you show
proper gratitude.

38:28.651 --> 38:29.585
You okay?

38:32.089 --> 38:35.257
It's my first kill.

38:35.259 --> 38:36.592
I had to.

38:39.796 --> 38:42.363
They ruled it
a good shooting, but...

38:42.365 --> 38:45.000
I got assigned
mandatory counseling.

38:45.002 --> 38:46.702
Hey.
You stopped a killer.

38:46.704 --> 38:48.236
You saved Marcus.

38:48.238 --> 38:51.306
He's gonna testify
against the 280 gang.

38:51.308 --> 38:53.241
Today's a good day.

38:59.848 --> 39:03.718
You're a real terror.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.287
You remind me of a friend.

39:06.289 --> 39:09.824
A couple of friends, actually.

39:09.826 --> 39:13.661
You're gonna see
a lot of death.

39:13.663 --> 39:16.597
Heroics ain't a job
you carry easy.

39:19.334 --> 39:23.403
<i>Dr. Enright is keeping an
eye on Delia at the safe house.</i>

39:23.405 --> 39:27.307
I've prepared a cover for her
once she's healed.

39:27.309 --> 39:29.476
She'll have to hide.

39:29.478 --> 39:30.978
What about Maple?

39:30.980 --> 39:32.879
<i>The factory has closed.</i>

39:32.881 --> 39:34.681
<i>Samaritan is pulling out.</i>

39:34.683 --> 39:37.151
Maple may fall apart.

39:37.153 --> 39:38.519
The people there
will have to learn

39:38.521 --> 39:40.954
to fend for themselves again.

39:43.024 --> 39:44.791
I sent you for nothing.
I'm sorry.

39:44.793 --> 39:47.194
<i>We saved people, Finch.</i>

39:47.196 --> 39:50.096
<i>Shaw would be proud.</i>

39:50.098 --> 39:53.933
And she'd understand
what we have to do.

39:53.935 --> 39:55.902
Root might not, though.

39:55.904 --> 39:57.671
<i>Good luck.</i>

40:01.075 --> 40:02.542
She knows.

40:06.146 --> 40:08.447
The Machine must know
where Shaw is

40:08.449 --> 40:09.682
and if she's alive.

40:09.684 --> 40:12.185
But...

40:12.187 --> 40:14.620
she won't tell me.

40:16.190 --> 40:19.192
Ms. Groves,
our only lead

40:19.194 --> 40:21.193
brought us
to the brink of disaster.

40:21.195 --> 40:23.962
You and John
came perilously close

40:23.964 --> 40:25.297
to being discovered.

40:28.168 --> 40:31.770
I care about her deeply.

40:31.772 --> 40:35.207
But if only for our own sake,
we have to let her go.

40:35.209 --> 40:38.910
You gave up on her days ago.

40:38.912 --> 40:40.912
You really think she's dead.

40:40.914 --> 40:44.115
I want to hold out hope.

40:44.117 --> 40:48.086
But hope is painful.

40:48.088 --> 40:49.921
We may never find her.

40:49.923 --> 40:52.224
We need an answer.

40:52.226 --> 40:53.891
I need an answer

40:53.893 --> 40:57.494
if Sameen is alive
or if she's dead.

40:57.496 --> 41:00.598
Please, help us.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.933
Please.

41:32.029 --> 41:33.563
Harold, what's she saying?

41:38.502 --> 41:42.672
<i>Sierra. Tango. Oscar. Papa.</i>

41:42.674 --> 41:44.840
<i>Sierra. Tango. Oscar. Papa.</i>

41:44.842 --> 41:47.510
"Stop."

41:47.512 --> 41:50.580
<i>Sierra. Tango. Oscar--</i>

41:52.182 --> 41:54.950
The Machine is asking us
to stop looking for her.

41:57.454 --> 41:58.854
Perhaps the Machine does know.

41:58.856 --> 42:00.622
Perhaps it has a plan.

42:00.624 --> 42:04.260
But for our own survival,

42:04.262 --> 42:06.461
our sanity,

42:06.463 --> 42:08.397
I believe we must
reconcile ourselves

42:08.399 --> 42:11.867
with never knowing the truth.

42:11.869 --> 42:15.805
Otherwise, our pursuit of it
will consume us entirely.

42:28.083 --> 42:30.819
Good-bye, Harold.

42:47.169 --> 42:49.737
<i>If this is the afterlife,</i>

42:49.739 --> 42:51.171
it sucks.

42:52.975 --> 42:55.943
<i>I sincerely hope</i>
<i>you managed to get some rest,</i>

42:55.945 --> 42:57.344
my dear Sameen.

42:57.346 --> 42:59.512
You're going to need it.
