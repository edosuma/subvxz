WEBVTT

00:27.235 --> 00:29.029
Come on, Ellie, pick up.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.365
<i>Hey, it's Ellie. I'm not available</i>
<i>right now, but if you leave your name--</i>

00:32.449 --> 00:34.075
Excuse me, how much longer?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.536
Hmm. Should be just another five minutes.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.913
You said that five minutes ago.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.540
Hi there.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.417
Sorry for the waiting.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.711
This department's not used
to handling much more

00:44.794 --> 00:47.922
than the occasional noise complaint,
or petty theft, or van--

00:48.965 --> 00:51.134
Detective Daniel Matuko.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.511
Nina Locke. I'm the one who found Joe.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.930
-Yes, I know. I was--
-Can we talk in private?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.932
Oh, sure. My office.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.227
-Offer you some coffee or a fresh cruller?

01:01.352 --> 01:02.270
No cruller.

01:05.857 --> 01:06.900
Have a seat.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.737
I'm very sorry about your friend.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.574
I didn't know him very well,
but Joe was a beloved man in this town.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.202
Which is why I wanted to speak to you
the other night at his house,

01:17.285 --> 01:18.828
but they told me I had to wait.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.414
I was actually planning
on calling you today to follow-up.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.459
-We're still investigating Joe's death.
-It wasn't suicide.

01:25.877 --> 01:26.878
He wouldn't do that.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.172
Like I said,
we're still investigating Joe's--

01:29.255 --> 01:30.632
Joe was murdered.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.635
What would make you think that?

01:33.718 --> 01:37.222
When I was there, the door was unlocked.
It was open.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.474
Most of the doors in this town
are unlocked.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.226
I heard someone in the house.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.894
Did you see anyone?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.939
Any evidence
that says somebody else was there?

01:46.022 --> 01:47.065
Well, no, no, but...

01:47.190 --> 01:50.276
he left me a voicemail
an hour before I found him.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.779
<i>Hi, Nina, it's Joe.</i>

01:53.404 --> 01:54.239
<i>I, uh--</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:56.366
<i>I just saw something.</i>

01:57.617 --> 01:59.077
<i>But I can't explain it.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:01.704
<i>I think I just need to show you,</i>
<i>I'll be home all night.</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:02.789
-What do you think

02:02.872 --> 02:04.541
-he planned on showing you?
-I have no idea.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.502
But that's not the message someone leaves
who's about to kill themselves.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.547
Joe had absolutely no reason
to commit suicide.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.881
I saw him that night.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.843
He wasn't upset about anything.
If anything, I was the one who was upset.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.261
About what?

02:17.345 --> 02:19.389
You might've heard that I...

02:19.931 --> 02:20.974
I lost my husband recently

02:21.057 --> 02:23.726
and Joe was helping me...

02:24.644 --> 02:26.062
try to make sense of it.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.023
Listen...

02:30.024 --> 02:33.319
I don't want to sound dismissive,
but I've got to go with the evidence.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.156
And the evidence
strongly points toward suicide.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.366
-That said,

02:38.783 --> 02:40.952
we will take everything
under consideration.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.412
What about Ellie Whedon?

02:42.495 --> 02:43.454
Have you talked to her?

02:43.538 --> 02:46.040
Sorry, Mrs. Locke,
I can't give you any more details.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.508
Is this Joe's?

02:55.592 --> 02:56.509
Yeah, we found that

02:56.593 --> 02:57.510
on his desk

02:57.594 --> 02:59.220
in his home office.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.222
He said he had to show me something.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.726
-It could've been something in this box.
-I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.730
But you have my word, I will be in touch
as soon as I know more.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.495
<i>Rendell, no!</i>

03:34.505 --> 03:35.340
So crazy, right?

03:36.257 --> 03:37.091
We just saw him

03:37.175 --> 03:38.593
and now he's gone.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.515
You never know
what's going on in someone's brain.

03:46.517 --> 03:47.352
That's true.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.688
Hey... do you still wanna come over later?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.024
Yeah, of course.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.401
Okay.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.830
<i>Okay, so we have a big problem.</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:10.708
-The climactic demise of Nephropidae.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.002
The first cut came out a bit rubbish.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.754
What, don't think we cracked the lobster?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.256
- Good one.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.633
But it's not all bad news, however.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.678
-I found another solution.
-And by "I," you mean--

04:21.761 --> 04:22.595
We, sorry.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.055
None of this would've been possible

04:24.138 --> 04:25.807
without the brilliant Kinsey Locke.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.310
I'm sorry, none of what, exactly?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.020
Oh, I've written a few extra scenes

04:31.104 --> 04:33.398
that I really think
will make this thing sing,

04:33.481 --> 04:34.983
and Kinsey and I have already shot one.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.279
And how's that?
All the equipment's in my van.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.239
Well, we...

04:41.364 --> 04:42.991
Kinsey had a work around.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.327
- Shit.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.371
What is it?

04:48.454 --> 04:50.039
We lost the Matheson Docks.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.084
-As in they... they sunk?
- As in Mr. Peña,

04:53.167 --> 04:54.836
the owner,
won't let us film there.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.212
Why not?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.340
He doesn't wanna deal
with potential liability... Blah, blah.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.884
See, there's a reason
no one wants to shoot in Matheson.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.678
This town is so not ready
for it's big break.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.513
Okay, it's fine. It's okay.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.307
We will find something else, all right?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.391
We have to, okay?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.226
This is the pivotal scene.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.561
This is our hero's epic showdown

05:11.644 --> 05:13.771
with Nephropidae inside his lair, okay?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.400
Let's think on it and regroup tomorrow,

05:17.483 --> 05:18.318
all right?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.774
-Hey, Kins! Where's Tyler?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.485
He's hanging at his girlfriend's tonight.

06:00.568 --> 06:04.322
Gone for a few weeks
and I miss all the hot goss.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.532
Whatcha got there?

06:07.825 --> 06:09.285
I want to show you something.

06:10.411 --> 06:14.499
Does it bother you that you don't remember
pieces of your childhood?

06:15.833 --> 06:18.086
I don't really think about it.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.756
I think your brain forgets old memories
to make space for new ones.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.591
What do you want to show me?

06:33.935 --> 06:34.936
What are those?

06:36.312 --> 06:37.772
They're memories.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.316
I think they're your memories.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.485
Well, how did they make...

06:43.194 --> 06:44.070
Who made these?

06:44.153 --> 06:45.905
I know this won't make any sense, but...

06:47.115 --> 06:49.242
I think someone took them
out of your head.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.917
I wanted you to look at them
to see if you remember

06:58.000 --> 06:58.835
anything about them.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.046
Duncan?

07:02.755 --> 07:04.298
What is it? What do you see?

07:08.719 --> 07:10.263
Feels so familiar, but I...

07:12.390 --> 07:14.100
I don't know what I'm looking at.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.941
Oh, I feel really queasy.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.905
I'm sorry. This was a bad idea.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.616
-What was a bad idea?

07:32.743 --> 07:35.121
Dunc?
Can you give me a hand with dinner?

07:35.246 --> 07:36.289
Yeah, I'll be right there.

07:36.914 --> 07:37.748
Excuse me.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.306
Hey.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.308
You good?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.225
Yeah.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.478
You've been staring at that same photo
of a coelacanth

07:58.561 --> 08:00.897
for an hour and I'm just wondering
if I should be jealous.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.441
Just... something on my mind.

08:04.108 --> 08:04.942
Like what?

08:06.027 --> 08:10.156
What I would rather be doing
instead of homework.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.914
I didn't realize
you were rocking some bling

08:17.997 --> 08:18.873
under there.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.584
-Sort of.
-I didn't mean to embarrass you.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.169
No, no, you didn't. Um...

08:24.670 --> 08:25.505
I just...

08:27.548 --> 08:28.966
I should get going, actually.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.385
Sorry, did I do something wrong?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.723
Oh, no, not at all.
I just, uh... lost track of the time.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.808
-You're sure?
-Yeah, of course.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.062
Okay, but you'll be there Sunday, right?

08:41.646 --> 08:42.688
Set-up's at two.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.357
Yeah, definitely.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.370
I have to show you something.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.788
Can't it wait?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.165
No, it really can't.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.970
I tried talking to Duncan
about what happened with Dad.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.431
I even tried showing him his memories,
but it didn't work.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.519
Adults can't remember magic.
We already know this.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.521
And by the way, you shouldn't be
doing that shit

09:23.604 --> 09:24.897
without us talking first.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.568
But it wasn't like
what happened with Mom, though.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.861
Even while he was watching the memory,
it was like,

09:30.987 --> 09:33.030
his brain couldn't process it
or something.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.615
My brain can barely process it.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.785
But there was one memory
he totally fixated on.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.264
What am I looking at?

09:58.806 --> 10:01.434
That's Dad and his friends
going down into the caves.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.980
Look at this next part.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.649
-See that blue light?

10:10.776 --> 10:13.696
Something happened to Dad and his friends
in that sea cave.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.072
I want to go down there.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.117
By yourself,
to chase after some weird blue light?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.202
I'm not gonna go by myself.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.414
I'm asking you to come with me.

10:27.918 --> 10:28.753
No.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.672
We don't know
what we saw in that memory, Tyler.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.549
We don't know what Dad did!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
Sure seems like he killed his friend.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.552
It was a moment.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.304
We don't know
what happened before.

10:39.055 --> 10:39.889
Or after!

10:40.014 --> 10:41.182
If we go down to the caves,

10:41.265 --> 10:43.017
-maybe we can get some answers.
-Kinsey, stop.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.894
-Our Dad's not a murderer!
- Kinsey!

10:51.150 --> 10:52.193
I'm done with this.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.070
-Meaning what?
-It means...

10:54.153 --> 10:55.237
I'm done.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.491
I'm done with Dad,
I'm done with these evil keys!

11:00.951 --> 11:01.952
They're all yours.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.705
Why are you avoiding me?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.625
Nina, this isn't the time or the place.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
You should've picked up one of my calls.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.212
You're hiding something.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.550
Outside, now.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.637
What do you want from me, Nina?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.599
You and Rendell have the exact same scar.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.977
I know you didn't get it
from a bike accident.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.770
That's what this is about?

12:09.854 --> 12:10.896
How'd you get it?

12:15.151 --> 12:16.360
We did it to ourselves,

12:16.861 --> 12:17.695
okay?

12:17.778 --> 12:20.322
Me, Rendell, Mark and Erin...

12:21.657 --> 12:23.659
senior year after our friends died,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.703
we pressed a hot poker to our chests.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.663
It was a way to remember them.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.041
Well, why wouldn't you have just
told me that when I asked?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.877
Because it was none of your business,

12:32.960 --> 12:33.836
that's why!

12:34.837 --> 12:38.299
It was a private,
intimate thing.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.427
-Now, if you'll excuse me.
-The night Joe died, where were you?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.765
I was home.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.057
No, you weren't.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.143
I went to your house and talked to Rufus

12:50.019 --> 12:51.479
right before I went to Joe's.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.647
You weren't there.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.780
What exactly are you accusing me of, Nina?
Just say it.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.115
Look...  I cared about Joe.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.243
Twenty-five years, Nina,
that's how long I've known Joe.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.330
You've been in town all of what,
a few months?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.333
So don't talk to me about caring for Joe.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.505
I tried really hard to be your friend.

13:34.772 --> 13:35.731
Wow.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.487
How the hell did you do that?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.364
It's a...

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
time lapse effect.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.035
-Yeah, great work, guys. It's magical.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.621
I mean, yeah, it's cool,

13:50.704 --> 13:52.581
but let me be the one
to state the obvious here,

13:52.665 --> 13:55.167
I mean, what's Nephropidae doing
chasing Amanda through the woods?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.293
He's a sea monster.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.212
We've been over this,
Douglas, okay?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.005
He's both water and land based.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.006
No?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.968
Look, what we really need
to be focusing our energy on

14:04.218 --> 14:05.219
is finding a new location

14:05.302 --> 14:07.638
for our final showdown. Okay? Now,

14:07.721 --> 14:08.639
there are no bad ideas.

14:08.722 --> 14:09.723
-Go.
-We could build one.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.141
With what budget?

14:11.225 --> 14:14.186
We could construct miniatures
and then film it in bathtubs.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.897
I stand corrected,
there are definitely bad ideas.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.233
-I thought this was a safe place.
-Well, I'm sorry Douglas,

14:19.316 --> 14:21.235
but we're making a monster piece here.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.486
I have an idea.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.572
What if we shoot
in the sea caves?

14:25.614 --> 14:26.448
Uh...

14:26.991 --> 14:29.535
I don't think that's a good idea.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.247
You know that they're nicknamed
the "Drowning Caves" for a reason?

14:33.330 --> 14:36.000
It's really not that scary
as long as you're careful.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.587
I've been down there before,
it's insanely cool!

14:39.670 --> 14:42.339
No, it would be a bitch
to get all our equipment down there, so--

14:42.423 --> 14:44.508
There are rumors
that place was like a government site.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.720
What if there's radiation or something?
I don't want to grow a third arm.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.097
You guys are being such killjoys
right now. Come on!

14:50.180 --> 14:51.599
I actually love this idea.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.976
I mean,
where's your sense of adventure?

14:54.101 --> 14:56.437
Yeah, you said yourself,
you don't want it to look like

14:56.520 --> 14:58.814
some cheap, hacky, home-made film, right?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.400
Well, obviously.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.153
Okay, unless someone's got a better idea,
I vote sea caves.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.785
All right, sea caves. Let's do it.

16:32.908 --> 16:33.951
Okay...

16:37.746 --> 16:38.664
Okay.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.272
Perhaps this is a Narnia situation.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.372
Whoa.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.292
It looks just like our world.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.087
Morning, kiddo.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.007
Want some cereal?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.884
You found the key!

17:32.217 --> 17:33.260
That's great.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.556
I found that cabinet in the basement
a few weeks ago.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.185
-There's nothing magical about it.
-Well, not yet.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.395
Wait till I refinish it.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.273
- Hey, Mom,

17:46.356 --> 17:47.941
do we have any flashlights?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.276
Mm...

17:49.443 --> 17:50.402
Try the closet upstairs.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.404
What do you need them for?

18:00.162 --> 18:00.996
Hello?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.831
<i>Hi. This is Detective Mutuku.</i>

18:02.915 --> 18:04.208
Yes. Hi, Detective.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.877
We found no signs of forced entry.

18:07.461 --> 18:11.924
No robbery, no fingerprints on the bag
other than Joe's or yours.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.928
No physical evidence
inconsistent with him killing himself.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.850
We interviewed a number of people
that were close with him

18:21.934 --> 18:24.186
and all of them described him
as being lonely.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.400
This upcoming weekend was the anniversary
of his wife's death.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.404
You're ruling it a suicide?

18:35.197 --> 18:38.242
Yes.

18:39.993 --> 18:40.911
Okay.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.251
-Is that it?
-Uh.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.211
I didn't find anything in here.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.550
Just some photographs
from when he was a yearbook adviser.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.846
Given that they're no longer evidence,
you're welcome to have 'em.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.684
Thank you.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.864
Hey, Uncle Duncan,
do you wanna go outside

19:16.947 --> 19:17.781
and explore?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.116
I wish I could, bud,

19:19.199 --> 19:20.033
but not now.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.287
I'm sorry,
I'm still fighting this migraine.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.998
I think
I'm almost on the other side of it.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.125
I'm gonna have to take a raincheck, okay?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.210
Okay.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.715
-I'll be outside. Hope you feel better.
-Mm-hmm.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.735
Hello, Bode.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.946
What do you want?

19:59.656 --> 20:02.242
I'm going to give you one last chance
to give me the keys.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.535
Never.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.456
And I know you can't take them from us.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.584
You have no idea what's coming.

20:14.630 --> 20:18.425
It's gonna destroy your family
and you'll be the one responsible.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.181
Don't say I didn't warn you.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.239
Hey, I'm taking off.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.908
My headache's finally eased up, so...

22:48.533 --> 22:50.118
What is all this?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.286
I'm looking for something.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.121
Can I help?

22:53.538 --> 22:55.665
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

22:57.125 --> 23:00.420
but... I'm not crazy.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.505
Who said you were?

23:01.630 --> 23:04.132
Ellie. I think messed things up with her.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.470
I accused her of something,
and I don't know.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.681
Maybe she was telling me the truth.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.643
-Truth about what?
-I wanted to know about this scar she has.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.354
It's the exact same scar that Rendell had.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.314
Do you remember that?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.566
Right here, by his collarbone?

23:22.943 --> 23:23.777
Not really.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.445
Another thing you don't remember?

23:25.946 --> 23:26.947
-I don't know,

23:27.030 --> 23:29.241
maybe the answer's not in this box.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.450
I just know...

23:33.328 --> 23:34.871
that something feels off here.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.166
I think you need a good night's sleep.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.253
-I'm sure that's true.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.629
Why don't we round up the kids,

23:42.712 --> 23:44.131
I'll drive us
back to Boston tonight,

23:44.214 --> 23:46.508
Bryan and I will take the kids out,
and you can just rest.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.676
Thanks.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.429
But, you know, I'm okay here.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.223
Okay.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.517
Talk in the morning. Hmm?

23:55.976 --> 23:56.852
Sure.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.216
- No way.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.263
Man, it really does feel like

24:33.346 --> 24:35.474
some otherworldly creature
could be lurking here, huh?

24:37.017 --> 24:38.059
Exactly. Come on!

24:38.643 --> 24:40.353
Now, this is cool. I mean,

24:40.437 --> 24:42.731
kinda scary, but really cool.

24:42.814 --> 24:43.982
Pretty awesome, right?

24:44.065 --> 24:45.650
-Yeah, it's amazing.
- Yeah.

24:45.734 --> 24:49.070
Yeah, the Matheson Docks are just like,
a super embarrassing memory right now.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.824
All right,
what if we put the camera here?

24:52.949 --> 24:55.327
We can catch the shot
of this dramatic entrance.

24:55.410 --> 24:56.745
That's perfect!

24:56.828 --> 24:58.830
Plus we get all this nice lighting
in the back side.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.415
- Shall we set up?
- Yeah.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.754
Kinsey, you got the tripod?

25:05.879 --> 25:07.172
Kinsey? Kinsey?

25:07.255 --> 25:09.508
-I think we should keep going.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.260
What? No, no, no, no.
This place is perfect!

25:12.344 --> 25:13.178
No!

25:14.262 --> 25:17.599
-There's a better location further in.
- Yeah, I don't know about that.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.184
That tunnel looks a little...

25:19.726 --> 25:21.144
hard on the ankles. And it's wet.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.522
Yeah, and we'd have to bring
all this equipment down there.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.023
Yeah guys, seriously, I...

25:25.774 --> 25:27.192
I don't want anybody to get hurt,

25:27.275 --> 25:28.985
and I don't think
I have phone signal here.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.820
Look, I'm telling you it's safe.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.073
And it's gonna be totally worth it.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.450
Trust me.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.203
Sounds like she knows
what she's talking about, guys.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.248
For Nephropidae, right?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.298
-Kinsey, just wait a sec.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.431
After you.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.268
Never question my commitment
to my craft ever again.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.936
I only said that

26:03.061 --> 26:05.021
because you were the one
who insisted on shooting

26:05.105 --> 26:07.649
-from your dad's freaking La-Z-Boy.
-It was the best angle,

26:07.732 --> 26:08.567
okay?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.859
- Really?
-Yes.

26:11.361 --> 26:12.946
-Oh! Take the head.
- Guys.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.200
Yo, guys.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.125
Here.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.963
Hey, wait up, huh?

26:54.821 --> 26:56.114
Holy shit.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.409
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa!

27:01.369 --> 27:02.370
Yeah, okay.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.955
Yeah, you were right, Kinsey.

27:05.248 --> 27:08.168
Wow, Doug gave his approval.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.920
This, my friends, is a miracle cave.

27:11.588 --> 27:12.464
Told you guys.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.466
I can see Nephropidae crawling out

27:14.549 --> 27:16.593
-from, like, right over there.
- Oh, I love it.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.678
What do you think, Scot?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.013
Scot?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.681
Oh, sorry, I was...

27:22.515 --> 27:23.975
just practicing my Oscar speech

27:24.059 --> 27:24.976
-in my head.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.520
All right, let's do it. Get set up.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.204
I could get used to having a lair.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.210
-What the...

28:35.630 --> 28:37.048
I don't understand how...

28:46.474 --> 28:47.851
Uh, guys?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.271
What is happening here?

28:58.319 --> 28:59.154
Oh, shit.

28:59.779 --> 29:00.947
I think the tide's coming in.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.950
We're already in so far.
How can it get all the way in here?

29:04.033 --> 29:06.411
Well, it's the ocean, Doug.
It's pretty bloody agile, yeah?

29:06.494 --> 29:08.163
Pack up everything, we're leaving now.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.750
Oh, man, this really isn't good.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.795
Where's Kinsey? Kinsey!

29:16.504 --> 29:17.505
I'm gonna go get her.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.673
I'll get her. You guys go.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.675
-No, we'll wait!
-No, that's putting everyone else

29:20.759 --> 29:23.136
in danger. Get out of here!
I'll meet you.

29:23.219 --> 29:24.053
Kinsey!

29:25.722 --> 29:27.390
- He'll be fine.
- Kinsey!

29:43.740 --> 29:45.158
We can't wait, we have to go now!

29:45.241 --> 29:46.951
-What about our equipment?
-Leave the stuff--

29:47.035 --> 29:50.246
We have to swim. It's flooded all the way
to the other cavern. Yo, let's go!

29:50.330 --> 29:52.165
No, no, no,
I don't think I can do that, okay?

29:52.248 --> 29:55.126
-Maybe if we just climb high enough--
-There is no high enough, Doug, okay?

29:55.210 --> 29:57.253
This thing is filling up
and it's filling fast. Okay?

29:57.337 --> 29:59.714
If we don't go now,
I promise you we will drown.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.466
Okay, now me and Zadie will help you.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.218
Let's go.

30:10.391 --> 30:13.561
Leave your bloody shoes, Doug!
Let's go!

30:14.938 --> 30:16.689
Kinsey! Kinsey, come on,
we have to go.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.566
The caves are flooding.
Kinsey, we have to go.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.235
-What are you doing?
-Get off me!

30:22.487 --> 30:24.280
-Okay.
- Nice and steady.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.740
Oh, my God. It's cold!

30:25.824 --> 30:27.617
-It's really cold!

30:28.451 --> 30:31.120
We've got to swim to the other cavern.
It's coming up.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.957
-Here it is. All right.

30:34.999 --> 30:35.834
Okay.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.462
On three, okay? Just take a deep breath
and don't stop swimming.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.548
One, two, three.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.258
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

30:45.051 --> 30:46.845
Okay...

30:52.809 --> 30:54.978
- <i>Kinsey, the cave is flooding!</i>

30:55.061 --> 30:57.647
If we don't go right now,
we're both gonna die. Come on, please.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.733
Kinsey, let's go.

31:01.442 --> 31:02.277
Come on.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.288
Oh, shit.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.081
I told you.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.375
We can do this.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.421
My flashlight's waterproof.
I'll go first.

31:35.643 --> 31:36.978
Oh, my God, I made it.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.565
-I can't believe I made it.
-What about Gabe and Kinsey?

32:24.233 --> 32:27.320
- You okay?
-Yeah, just a little farther.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.989
- I don't think we're gonna make it.
-Yes, we are.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.171
- Kinsey!

32:50.426 --> 32:51.344
That was fun.

32:52.845 --> 32:55.723
-Why didn't you tell us that could happen?
-I didn't know!

32:55.807 --> 32:57.600
Even though you're such an expert
on the caves?

32:57.684 --> 32:59.102
We could've all died!

32:59.394 --> 33:00.979
I know, I'm sorry.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.982
I'm so sorry, but at least we're all safe.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.358
We lost all our gear!

33:05.441 --> 33:08.319
-So? We'll replace it! I'll replace it!
-With what money?

33:08.736 --> 33:10.905
Kinsey, do you know how many hours
of scooping ice cream

33:10.989 --> 33:12.323
it took me to buy all that stuff?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.200
You said you wanted a good location,
so I...

33:14.283 --> 33:16.869
-Oh, bullshit! You left us down there!
-...was just trying to help.

33:16.953 --> 33:20.123
Did you even care about this film at all?
Why are we even here?

33:20.206 --> 33:23.334
I have more to worry about
than this stupid little movie, okay?

33:39.058 --> 33:40.727
I never should have trusted you.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.104
Never.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.426
You saved my life back there.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.305
You know that, right?

34:19.849 --> 34:20.933
I would've drowned.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.815
Well,  I'm sure you would've done
the same thing for me.

34:28.399 --> 34:32.320
Besides, I can't really blame you.
I mean, that door was...

34:33.946 --> 34:35.448
What the hell was that thing?

34:37.450 --> 34:38.451
I don't know.

34:42.538 --> 34:44.373
I think it has something to do
with the magic,

34:44.957 --> 34:46.000
and the keys.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.379
What, you might have a key that opens it?

34:50.505 --> 34:51.589
No.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.178
I... don't really have anything.

34:58.137 --> 35:00.181
I don't even have the Savinis anymore.

35:01.557 --> 35:04.685
Just... give them some time,
they'll get over it.

35:04.852 --> 35:06.229
Sure.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.065
I should never have made you guys
go down there.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.360
You didn't make us do anything.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.862
No, I did.
I lied about knowing about the cave.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.532
Well, I, for one, am glad we did it.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.245
I'm serious.
What else would I have been doing today?

35:22.995 --> 35:26.415
Filming some crappy little scene
in Doug's basement? Doing homework?

35:26.916 --> 35:29.085
I mean, I'm excited to be alive right now!

35:29.293 --> 35:33.005
And not just because we almost drowned,
but you just...

35:33.631 --> 35:35.216
you have that effect on people.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.468
You have this energy that I think

35:37.677 --> 35:39.679
we'd all follow, anywhere.

35:39.762 --> 35:40.805
I mean, I would.

35:43.933 --> 35:44.767
You're a badass.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.271
I don't feel like a badass.

35:50.731 --> 35:51.774
I like this Kinsey.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.775

36:34.859 --> 36:36.777
You're not there either, dude.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.946
Jackie wasn't counting on me, dude.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.990
She was expecting you.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.993
I'm sure she's got it under control,

36:44.368 --> 36:45.578

36:54.086 --> 36:56.339

36:56.547 --> 36:58.216
We miss having you on the team, man.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.718
Not sure that's true,
but I miss you guys, too.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.054
See, you're softening up all ready, bro!

37:03.221 --> 37:05.431
Me and Javi are doing this thing
where on every third day,

37:05.514 --> 37:06.641
we only eat meat.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.976
Really starting to see the difference
actually, though.

You can have mine.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.974

37:49.183 --> 37:52.436

My body is a temple.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.231
Yeah, I can see that.

37:55.481 --> 37:58.067

we can get you something better.

Uh, dude, Jackie Veda just showed up.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.802
Who's Jackie Veda?

38:26.470 --> 38:27.638
-Uh...

38:27.722 --> 38:29.932
-She's, um...
-Right.

38:30.725 --> 38:31.684
I get it.

38:33.352 --> 38:35.271
I will see you around.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.859
I'm sorry we didn't get
to spend more time together.

-I can't believe you.
-Jackie,

38:46.866 --> 38:48.993
-uh...
-You knew how much this mattered to me,

38:49.076 --> 38:50.953
how much it mattered to Mr. Ridgeway.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.165
Trust me,
I'm doing you a favor.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.002
Bailing on something you knew
was important to me, that's a favor?

38:58.085 --> 38:59.670
Better sooner than later.

39:01.881 --> 39:05.051
Look, I know you're going through a lot
right now...

39:07.470 --> 39:09.180

39:09.764 --> 39:12.224
You can't understand, you really can't.

39:13.851 --> 39:14.685
Fine.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.442
-Am I understanding you now?

39:22.026 --> 39:23.152
Jackie, what are you doing?

39:23.235 --> 39:24.070
Yum...

39:26.197 --> 39:27.948
-Let's play some beer pong.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.325
No, no, maybe we should wrestle!

39:29.408 --> 39:30.284

39:30.368 --> 39:31.952
No, I'm having fun. You go.

It's okay, bud.

She's just trying to scare you
into giving her what she wants.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.757
Look, I'm not afraid of her
and you shouldn't be either.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.760

carry boxes up from the basement?

41:24.190 --> 41:25.065
Fine.

41:26.108 --> 41:27.109

-sort of a... sort of a weird night.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.524
