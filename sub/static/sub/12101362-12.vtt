WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.878
Previously on Dynasty...
Leo, hiring your crew

00:03.920 --> 00:05.296
might have been
a little premature,

00:05.338 --> 00:07.007
and we need to pump the brakes.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.843
And my guys really don't like it
when someone goes back

00:09.884 --> 00:11.678
on their word.
Is this some kind of threat?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.263
I have a brain tumor.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.765
We can start treatment
next week in Atlanta.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.809
This is so great. Thank you.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.646
The Atlanta Fashion Council
sponsors a runway show

00:21.688 --> 00:22.939
for an up-and-coming designer,

00:22.981 --> 00:24.858
and I've been selected
as a finalist.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.152
I hope it works out.
Maybe next year,

00:27.193 --> 00:30.488
you and Blake can sit front row
at my Paris fashion show.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.990
Do you remember
that, uh, private airline

00:32.032 --> 00:33.450
company you wanted me to buy?

00:33.491 --> 00:34.534
I bought it,

00:34.576 --> 00:35.702
and I'm giving it to you.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.832
♪ Give me the keys and now
we're leaving together... ♪

00:40.874 --> 00:42.125
HOWIE:
We've got a fleet

00:42.167 --> 00:44.711
of 200 jets, mostly Cessnas.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.713
We bought a couple
of G450s last year,

00:46.755 --> 00:48.339
but we found
our clientele typically opts

00:48.381 --> 00:49.966
for the midsize cabin.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.218
Well, I typically opt for
a large-sized company,

00:52.260 --> 00:53.845
so I'd like to be at 300 planes

00:53.887 --> 00:56.139
before the end
of the first quarter.
300?

00:56.181 --> 00:59.059
Yeah. And-and I need to sit down
with the marketing department.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.187
We need a new app to streamline
the booking process.
Yeah.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.563
Preferably one
that doesn't crash

01:03.605 --> 01:05.148
every time we make a selection.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.400
We don't really use the
word "crash" in our business.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.779
Mr. Carrington, I think
you may want to slow down?

01:10.820 --> 01:12.739
Look, Howie, I get it.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.284
Nobody likes a new boss
rolling in, making big changes,

01:16.326 --> 01:18.036
but you'll get used to it.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.955
With all due respect,
we were already surprised

01:20.997 --> 01:22.540
when your daughter
bought the company.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.959
But then we got handed off
to her oil baron father.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.920
How do we know
you'll even be here in a week?

01:26.961 --> 01:29.130
Aviation is not a game to me.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
Hey, I know a beautiful

01:31.174 --> 01:33.093
twin-engine Piper
when I see one.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.428
That Comanche
you've got over in hangar 12?

01:35.470 --> 01:38.515
I soloed first time in
a Piper just like that one.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.141
You're a pilot?
I made my fortune in oil,

01:40.183 --> 01:43.937
but I have always had a passion
for flying.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.730
Had my pilot's license
before I could drive.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.358
I'll have the guys
in marketing reach out.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.360
Great.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.487
Forgive me, sir,
but need I remind you

01:52.529 --> 01:55.865
that you didn't actually finish
your pilot's certification?

01:55.907 --> 01:57.826
Yeah, it was a
technicality, all right?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.619
I was basically done.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.871
Nothing a few more hops
couldn't fix.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.290
You flew for your country,
right? You certify me.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.168
Well, of course. It's just
that the last flight...
That's ancient history.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.921
If I'm gonna shape this
company into my vision,

02:09.963 --> 02:11.965
I need the respect of
the people that work here.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.925
And the best way
to get that respect

02:13.967 --> 02:16.219
is by jumping back
into that cockpit.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.680
Pick up the pace. You're
getting left behind.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.181
Totally cool with that.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.350
Why did I ever agree to this?
Because

02:22.392 --> 02:24.978
I found ten hard candy wrappers
on your bed this morning.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.688
It's called stress-eating.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.940
Turns out, having
a business partner isn't as easy

02:28.982 --> 02:30.191
as I thought it would be.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.651
Wait a minute. Wait.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.153
Are you talking about Culhane?

02:33.194 --> 02:34.863
The most laid-back
guy on the planet?

02:34.904 --> 02:37.282
He's gonna be a lot less
laid-back when he finds out

02:37.323 --> 02:40.160
I hired this sketchy contractor
without his approval.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.371
Or maybe I should just not tell
him and hope he never finds out.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.165
Are you even listening to me?

02:45.206 --> 02:47.959
No. I'm sorry. I zoned out
after "stress-eating."

02:48.001 --> 02:50.336
Liam gets back today,
after his insider trading,

02:50.378 --> 02:52.505
slash, dead-dad investigation.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.591
Okay, now I understand
the extra workout.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.467
Mama's gonna get some action.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.511
That's disgusting, but yes.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.555
I have arranged to have
our bedroom stocked

03:00.597 --> 03:03.474
with enough food and alcohol
to last us 48 hours.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.893
He won't ever
have to leave.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.020
Any chance
that 48 hours starts now?

03:07.061 --> 03:08.730
No. Come on.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.648
Those calories aren't
gonna burn themselves.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.108
Ugh.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.403
Mm, well, it's not the
Carrousel du Louvre,

03:15.445 --> 03:18.323
but it should suit
my needs just fine.

03:18.364 --> 03:21.576
Hmm. I can see
the runway now.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.120
You sure you're ready
to pull off a fashion show?

03:24.162 --> 03:27.790
This is the best way
to debut Dom-Mystique.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.459
And now that Clark
Hoffman is coming--

03:29.500 --> 03:31.878
thank you for making
that happen--

03:31.920 --> 03:35.006
this is the beginning of
my very own fashion empire.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.634
He is the top buyer
for Galliard Designs.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.802
He can make or break this.

03:39.844 --> 03:42.096
Well, Clark is only coming if
he likes your design pictures.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.890
So don't forget
to send those soon.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.433
I know.
And they're Mom's designs.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.018
I just spruced them up a bit.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.603
I'm sure Clark will love them.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.979
But what are you planning
for...?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.397
Jeff, I don't have time
to chitchat.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.399
I need to get started
on those photos.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.860
What did she want?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.822
A favor,
which I now want from you.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.950
Seeing as how
we're technically

04:01.991 --> 04:05.328
still in escrow here, would
the almost-new owner consider

04:05.370 --> 04:07.622
letting Dom use the space for
her runway show this weekend?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.917
I don't know, Jeff. I haven't
had the best luck with Dom.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.961
I'll knock 20 grand
off the purchase price.
Sold.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.672
Thank you.
It'll mean a lot to her.

04:15.713 --> 04:18.508
I know it will, but
your mother makes me nervous.

04:18.549 --> 04:22.053
Last time I trusted her, I ended
up costarring in a sex tape.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.682
Really don't need to remind me.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.689
That is all for today.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.066
Need to get a few
more treatments in

04:35.108 --> 04:37.652
before we find out if the
tumor is shrinking or not.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.070
How do you feel?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.405
I'm okay.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.408
Hopeful, actually.
Good.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.410
Thank you for this.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.245
For helping me keep it all
from Blake.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.373
It's not gonna
get any easier.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.166
The treatment or
keeping it a secret.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.459
The side effects can be

04:53.501 --> 04:55.503
pretty severe-- fatigue, nausea,

04:55.545 --> 04:56.879
even hair loss.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.381
I can handle it.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.632
That's what wigs are for.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.342
Blake is going to notice.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.052
I know you're strong, but...

05:03.094 --> 05:05.179
you're gonna have
to tell him soon.

05:05.221 --> 05:08.308
I know. I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.270
It's not gonna be an easy thing
for him to process.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.689
(groaning)

05:14.731 --> 05:16.149
Hey, partner. Have a seat.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.651
We've got club business
to discuss.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.737
I wish I could, but
Fallon made me work out

05:20.778 --> 05:23.698
with her this morning, and
I have no feeling in my legs.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.534
(laughs)
What's this?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.828
A list of potential replacement
contractors for the renovation

05:28.870 --> 05:30.663
now that you've let Leo go.

05:32.248 --> 05:35.376
Great. We'll set something up
for the next week or two.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.795
Step ahead of you. I've already
scheduled the appointments.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.339
No time to waste, right?
Right.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.467
Totally. No time.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.926
But you know,
we should still

05:43.968 --> 05:45.887
keep Leo's crew
in consideration.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.139
He deserves a fair shot.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.641
Especially with his city council
connections that can help us.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.394
I guess, but I really
don't think he's our guy.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.480
A lot of these new people
have connections,

05:55.521 --> 05:58.232
and come highly recommended
at almost half the price.

05:58.274 --> 06:02.445
Well, you know what they say.
Half the price, double the time.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.530
Am I right?

06:04.572 --> 06:06.491
I-I got to go ice
my thighs. I...

06:06.532 --> 06:11.037
(door opens)
ALEXIS:
Oh. It's not Soho House,

06:11.079 --> 06:13.831
but it should suit
my needs just fine.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.709
Alexis, the club isn't open
for business or your needs.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.920
That's where
you're wrong.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.089
This place is perfect
for a luncheon

06:21.130 --> 06:24.634
I am hosting this weekend
for my dear friend, Elsie Von.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.928
She's flying in from
New York for Fashion Week.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.181
Naturally, I assume a
family discount applies?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.682
We're not family.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.435
You and Fallon were
engaged. Close enough.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.938
Sorry that didn't
work out, by the way.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.357
I already rented
the place out to Dominique.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.859
What possible use
could she have for it?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.654
Does she need a bigger space
to contemplate her empty life?

06:44.695 --> 06:47.115
Some fashion show she's having
for her new clothing line.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.076
Oh, please. That woman couldn't
design a decent hand towel.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.537
Is this about her pajamas?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.959
No, it's the real thing.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.253
From what I hear,
she's got some good stuff.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.296
So I get why you'd be jealous.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.173
Jealous?

07:04.215 --> 07:08.386
Oh, please. I haven't been
jealous since the early '90s.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.555
I can get dressed up
and traipse around here

07:10.596 --> 07:12.223
just as easily as she can.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.683
Maybe.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.393
But you don't have
some big fashion buyer

07:15.435 --> 07:16.602
named Clark Hoffman

07:16.644 --> 07:18.020
interested in you
like she does.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.774
So, sorry. Can't help you.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.907
FALLON:
And I want those little fish
from Japan. You know,

07:29.949 --> 07:31.993
the ones that pick all the dead
skin off your feet? I was...

07:32.034 --> 07:33.744
(Liam whispering)
Liam?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.330
Liam? Are you okay?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.791
Fallon.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.793
Sorry. I was, uh...

07:40.835 --> 07:42.712
I was trying to
remember a name.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.174
Oh. Well, I thought you weren't
coming home until tonight.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.675
I mean, I had
a whole thing planned.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.343
Massage tables
haven't even arrived yet.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.053
Yeah. No, I-I took
a red-eye last minute.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.556
I have big news.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.725
So I followed up with
that lead from Washington,

07:55.766 --> 07:57.727
which led to a former
broker in New York,

07:57.768 --> 07:59.145
and then, she mentioned
that her old boss used...

07:59.187 --> 08:00.563
Okay, okay, take a breath.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.356
You're Beautiful Mind-ing
a little bit.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.025
Tell me the abridged version.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.027
Corinne was right.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.362
The insider-trading ring
is still running,

08:08.404 --> 08:10.698
and I know
who the mastermind is.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.241
Uh, here we go.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.869
Georgia Senator Bill North.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.497
Now, I have a transcript
of a call between his office

08:17.538 --> 08:19.665
and an informant,
basically confirming it.

08:19.707 --> 08:23.336
Well, that all sounds great,
while also giving me a headache.

08:23.377 --> 08:26.714
But I have some
chocolate-covered strawberries

08:26.756 --> 08:29.008
and a whole lot
of pent-up sexual energy

08:29.050 --> 08:30.676
that I think
might solve the problem.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.429
I haven't told you
the craziest part.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.724
Crazier than whatever it was
you were just talking about?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.935
My dad wasn't part
of the ring anymore.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.103
He was trying to expose it,

08:41.145 --> 08:42.647
and that's when
North had him killed.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.775
Whoa. That's...
Do you have proof?

08:45.816 --> 08:48.736
I mean, you can't just
accuse a senator of murder.
No.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.738
I know. That's why
I came home early.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.573
I have a meeting
with an informant

08:52.615 --> 08:53.866
first thing tomorrow
to get more evidence.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.202
Oh.
Uh,

08:56.244 --> 08:58.371
look, you can stay if you want.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.414
Just keep it down, okay?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.668
Uh, wait.
What?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.337
Can you actually close
those doors, please?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.381
I don't want anyone
seeing anything by mistake.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.383
Do you really think
you could be in danger?

09:10.424 --> 09:12.677
Only if I'm right.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.640
♪ ♪

09:38.911 --> 09:40.830
Oh, hey.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.832
Hey. Where are you off to?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.209
Um, the clinic. Something
came up with a patient.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.211
Oh, that's too bad.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.629
I was thinking we could
have lunch together.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.214
Nothing too serious, I hope?

09:50.256 --> 09:53.301
We're trying this new
experimental treatment,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.928
and I have no idea whether
or not it's gonna work.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.180
It's just so frustrating.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.182
For my patient.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.893
Yeah, I'm sure. Hey,
listen, my car's waiting.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.312
Why don't I give you
a ride to the clinic?

10:04.353 --> 10:05.980
Oh, that's all right.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.565
I wouldn't want you
to make a detour just for me.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.983
Hey, is everything okay?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.527
You've been a little
distant lately.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.613
Talk to me.
JENNINGS:
Everything's fine.

10:13.654 --> 10:18.492
I-I... I can't ride
with you because, um...

10:18.534 --> 10:20.494
Because she's-she's coming
with me.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.871
Uh, I'm heading to the hospital

10:21.912 --> 10:23.372
anyway, and...

10:23.414 --> 10:26.167
I asked Cristal to ride shotgun,
spend a little

10:26.208 --> 10:27.918
bonding time
with my stepmother.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.295
Oh, well, I'm a little surprised

10:29.337 --> 10:30.546
to see the two of you
getting along

10:30.588 --> 10:32.340
so well lately, but

10:32.381 --> 10:34.383
it's nice... I think.
(chuckles)

10:34.425 --> 10:36.510
I'll see you tonight.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.600
So I guess you still haven't
found the perfect time?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.143
(scoffs)

10:45.102 --> 10:46.896
(sighs heavily)

10:46.937 --> 10:49.398
Have you slept
or showered?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.816
I'm getting concerned.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.735
Yeah, but check this out.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.112
I got a copy of the senator's
tax return at my meeting.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.699
North donated 100 grand to
Paul Sabino's charity foundation

10:58.741 --> 11:01.118
two days after my father's body
was found.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.162
Sabino's a known criminal.
So what are you saying?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.498
I'm saying North wasn't donating
to charity.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.417
I bet this is how he paid Sabino
to have my father killed.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.419
Okay, hold on.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.380
I mean, that's a bit of a leap,
don't you think?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.256
Unless you have some proof
that I haven't seen yet,

11:14.298 --> 11:15.841
I don't think that's enough
to go public with.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.343
No, it's not.
I-I know that.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.053
Okay, good. Well,
maybe you need a break.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.680
I mean, you've been
going at this nonstop.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.474
What I need is correspondence
between the two.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.226
Now, if I can establish
a personal connection

11:25.267 --> 11:27.228
between the two, it'll be enough

11:27.269 --> 11:28.813
to open
an official investigation.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.399
Well, unless
you have his personal computer,

11:31.440 --> 11:33.067
I don't know how
you're gonna get that.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.486
You know, unless he keeps
a key under his doormat

11:35.528 --> 11:38.531
and a sticky-note on his desk
with his password written on it.

11:38.572 --> 11:41.242
That was one time,
and it was my Netflix password.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.661
Which Sam still
uses to this day.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.246
Check this out.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.082
The senator is having
a campaign fundraising event

11:48.124 --> 11:49.792
at his mansion today.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.336
So I'll find a way into
the party, access his computer,

11:52.378 --> 11:54.547
get the proof I need.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.550
That sounds like a terrible
idea for so many reasons.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.511
Yeah, maybe, but I need
to see this through.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.516
Okay, fine. Fine, I'll help you.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.644
Yes, but once
this is done,

12:08.686 --> 12:10.646
if it turns out
that you're wrong,

12:10.688 --> 12:12.690
you have to promise me
that you'll drop this.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.734
Okay, I miss you,
and I'm starting

12:14.775 --> 12:18.112
to worry that this is getting
unhealthy, and not just for me.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.321
I promise.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.990
So what are you thinking?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.492
Well, neither one of us can risk
putting our real names

12:23.534 --> 12:25.745
on that guest list
without raising suspicion.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.080
Okay. So what's the plan?

12:28.122 --> 12:31.584
It's time for someone to pay you
back for all that free Netflix.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.880
May I help you?

12:35.921 --> 12:37.465
I'm actually here to help you.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.383
I'm Rachel,
Clark Hoffman's assistant.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.385
I just came by to drop
off a little swag-bag

12:41.427 --> 12:43.846
with some of our new products,
courtesy of Clark.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.181
Oh, come in!

12:45.222 --> 12:46.932
That's so nice.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.977
He always sends a little
something to potential clients.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.815
(clears throat)
Is something wrong?

12:54.857 --> 12:58.527
Oh, no. Not at all. Everything
looks great. It's just...

12:58.569 --> 13:01.071
Well, it's really
not my place. (laughs)

13:01.113 --> 13:03.783
Oh, now you have to tell me.
I'll be worrying all night.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.868
Okay. It's just...

13:05.910 --> 13:09.038
your designs are a little...

13:09.079 --> 13:11.040
uncomplicated.

13:11.081 --> 13:14.126
I think of them
as classic, elegant.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.171
Which can be good,
but between us,

13:17.213 --> 13:20.883
lately, Clark has been
favoring clothes with more...

13:20.925 --> 13:22.968
panache, you know?

13:23.010 --> 13:26.764
Frills, sparkle, something
that makes a statement.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.432
Oh. I didn't know that.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.976
Look, it's just
something I've noticed.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.688
But there's really no rush
on sending in those photos.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.732
Bye now.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.284
EMMA:
Mr. Carrington, hi.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.245
How are you these days?
I am feeling good today, Emma.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.663
Would you tell
Mrs. Carrington I'm here?

13:50.704 --> 13:52.289
I thought I'd surprise her

13:52.331 --> 13:53.874
with lunch
from her favorite Thai place.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.377
Oh, I think
there must have been a mix-up.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.295
Mrs. Carrington hasn't been here
all day.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.131
Oh, what do you mean? She's
at the clinic. She told me...

14:02.967 --> 14:05.761
(laughs softly)

14:09.640 --> 14:11.600
LIAM:
Did you get the invitation?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.936
Yes, per Fallon's
very specific instructions,

14:13.978 --> 14:15.771
I donated the maximum
legal amount

14:15.813 --> 14:17.439
to Senator North's campaign,

14:17.481 --> 14:19.441
which got me an immediate invite
to the fundraiser.

14:19.483 --> 14:20.860
You owe me, big-time.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.278
Send me an invoice.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.071
So basically, Liam just has

14:24.113 --> 14:25.865
to go in there,
wearing a hat

14:25.906 --> 14:28.075
and some glasses, pretend
to be Sammy Jo for five minutes,

14:28.117 --> 14:30.202
and sneak around
before anyone notices a thing.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.954
Did you forward the evite?
I did.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.622
A few minutes ago.
Thank you both.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.124
This really means
a lot to me.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.667
Just be careful, okay?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.419
I mean, just because
these people don't know

14:38.460 --> 14:40.004
who Sammy Jo is,
they're still dangerous.
(phone buzzes)

14:40.045 --> 14:41.297
And they could...
Go for Sam.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.300
Don't... Me!
Hi, Deborah.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.343
Yes.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.470
I understand,
but what if...

14:49.638 --> 14:51.599
Oh, okay.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.517
Okay, got it.
Thank you.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.395
That was the
North campaign.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.147
They didn't rescind the
invitation, did they?

14:58.188 --> 14:59.773
No, but they said
I need a photo ID

14:59.815 --> 15:01.567
to get in, and that tickets are

15:01.609 --> 15:03.694
strictly
nontransferable.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.323
It's like they were
listening to us.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.450
Or reading your email.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.578
They called right after
Sammy forwarded that to you.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.496
That can't be a coincidence.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.208
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

15:18.250 --> 15:21.670
but I am starting to think you
may not actually be so crazy.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.347
♪ I want to feel good... ♪

15:31.388 --> 15:34.642
(indistinct chatter)

15:34.683 --> 15:36.936
Watch out, ladies!
Ice queen coming in!

15:36.977 --> 15:38.354
(camera shutter clicking)

15:38.395 --> 15:40.689
You bought an ice version
of yourself?

15:40.731 --> 15:42.775
Is Jeff footing the bill
for all of this?

15:42.816 --> 15:46.153
I'm not dependent
on my son's financial support.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.530
The royalties from my new line
will be more than enough

15:48.572 --> 15:50.032
to cover the expenses.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.117
So you're just maxing out
your credit cards?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.869
Don't you know the expression

15:53.911 --> 15:55.871
of putting all of your eggs
on one runway?

15:55.913 --> 15:58.499
If the basket is Clark Hoffman,

15:58.540 --> 16:01.502
and the eggs are my designs,
then, yes, I do.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.003
Do you even understand
what you're talking about?

16:03.045 --> 16:04.421
(phone buzzing)

16:04.463 --> 16:06.799
Oh, perfect.
Listen and learn, Michael.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.510
Dominique Deveraux.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.011
CHERYL:
Hello, Ms. Deveraux.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.097
This is Cheryl
from Clark Hoffman's office.

16:13.138 --> 16:17.351
Hi there! So when can we expect
Clark to arrive this afternoon?

16:17.393 --> 16:20.437
Oh, unfortunately, Clark won't
be able to attend your show.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.857
What? May I ask why?

16:23.899 --> 16:26.652
I'm sorry. He just feels
your line isn't right

16:26.694 --> 16:28.821
for the marketplace
at this time.

16:28.862 --> 16:32.449
Clark tends to favor more...
um, elegant simplicity?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.411
But you told me
he wanted panache.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.454
Me? (chuckles)

16:37.496 --> 16:39.164
I didn't tell you anything.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.125
We've never spoken before.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.252
Then who was in my loft?
Was it his other assistant?

16:43.293 --> 16:45.087
I'm not good with names.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.047
I'm Clark's only assistant.
Sorry.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.590
(line beeps)
ALEXIS:
Oh.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.759
You poor thing.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.428
What are you doing here?

16:52.469 --> 16:55.347
I was just looking for Sam.
An issue with my minibar.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.392
I couldn't help but overhear
that your little runway show is

16:58.434 --> 16:59.893
dead on arrival.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.564
If you had something
to do with this...

17:03.605 --> 17:05.941
Guess you won't be needing the
club this weekend after all.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.110
Culhane, would you be a doll

17:08.152 --> 17:10.070
and tidy this place
up for my luncheon?

17:10.112 --> 17:12.489
Fine, but you're paying
full price.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.409
Oh, believe me,
it'll be worth it.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.500
Fallon was right.
Your email account was hacked.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.961
Someone's been reading your
messages for a few weeks now.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.005
How did they get
into his account?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.590
Well, whoever hacked

17:29.631 --> 17:30.966
into your company servers
wasn't going after you.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.384
They were clearly looking
for Liam.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.969
Do you have a
Fallon Unlimited email account?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.971
Yeah, from when I worked there,
but I don't use it.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.431
Everything just forwards
to my regular account.

17:37.473 --> 17:39.308
Which is exactly
what they wanted.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.851
Going through Fallon's company

17:40.893 --> 17:44.396
to get to you was a genius way
to go unnoticed.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.898
(sighs)

17:45.939 --> 17:47.858
These guys are good.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.151
Like, U.S. government good?

17:49.193 --> 17:51.320
Maybe.
FALLON:
Okay.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.490
Can't you do some sort
of a reverse-hack,

17:54.531 --> 17:56.784
you know, to Senator
North's computer?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.036
You're kidding, right?
Ah.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.247
But this is preloaded
with a program I wrote myself.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.084
Plug this in, one click,
and it'll download everything

18:05.125 --> 18:07.086
on his computer
in just a few minutes.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.547
If you can get that far.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.258
Good luck with it all.
LIAM:
Thank you.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.676
Thanks.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.470
If this man
really is responsible

18:16.512 --> 18:17.930
for my father's death...

18:17.971 --> 18:19.807
Then you have
to see it through. I know.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.934
But I am not letting you
do this alone.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.477
We just have

18:23.519 --> 18:25.354
to figure out another way
into this fundraiser.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.565
ANDERS:
Right aileron.

18:28.607 --> 18:32.152
Check. Propeller okay.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.279
Tires?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.407
Sir?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.326
Oh, yeah.
Those tires are fine.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.744
There are still chocks
on the front wheel.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.329
Could be a very short flight.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.914
You know, maybe today's not such
a good day to fly.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.415
Who knows what
the weather's like up there?

18:45.457 --> 18:46.208
Well, maybe we could find out.

18:47.876 --> 18:52.005
If this is about Daisy, I assure
you, nothing is going to happen.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.882
It has nothing to do
with her, all right?

18:53.924 --> 18:55.801
I'm just a little distracted,
that's all.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.470
Cristal's lying to me.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.847
About what?
I'm not sure.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.265
But after her fling
with that priest,

19:01.306 --> 19:02.808
my mind is all over the place.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.893
I just...

19:04.935 --> 19:07.187
I need to get
to the bottom of it.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.190
Yeah.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.280
(knocking)
JEFF: I got a call from
one of your models.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.199
We had drinks the other
night, so she had my, uh...

19:19.241 --> 19:22.327
Not important. She said
you told everyone to go home?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.746
Show's canceled.
Clark's not coming,

19:24.788 --> 19:26.123
and without him,
there's no point.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.708
What? Clark didn't like
the clothes?

19:27.749 --> 19:29.960
He never saw them.
At least not the real ones.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.797
I was sabotaged, and I think
I know who was behind it.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.509
Look, forget about that
for a second, okay?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.138
You started this to
honor your mother.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.931
And when Monica and I
were growing up,

19:42.973 --> 19:45.559
Grandma Lo always supported us,
unless we gave up.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.770
Then you've never seen such
a sweet woman get so vicious.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.815
Yes, I got some of that
as a kid, too.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.567
If you really want

19:53.609 --> 19:55.819
to honor her memory, don't quit.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.906
Find another way
to get your clothes seen.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.574
You're right.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.827
Call your model girlfriend.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.122
If Clark won't come to my show,

20:07.164 --> 20:09.291
I'll just have

20:09.333 --> 20:11.501
to take it to a buyer who will.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.878
Yes.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.213
(laughs)

20:14.254 --> 20:16.590
Thanks. We'll be in touch.
Mm.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.426
Well?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.887
She seems to know her stuff,
and the price is fair.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.015
I don't know. A girl
contractor, really?

20:25.057 --> 20:29.228
I think it's "woman,"
and I also think it's 2021.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.480
But... then how about Phillip?

20:31.521 --> 20:34.441
He was fine, but I mean, what
about that sweater? (laughs)

20:34.483 --> 20:36.944
We can't hire a
contractor with no taste.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.154
When I was talking
to Leo, he...

20:39.196 --> 20:41.365
What is it with you and Leo?

20:41.406 --> 20:44.034
Are you guys related?
Is he your uncle?

20:44.076 --> 20:48.080
Truth is, when I went
to fire Leo like we discussed,

20:48.121 --> 20:49.873
he kind of...

20:49.915 --> 20:51.875
threatened me.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.670
He threatened you?
Yes. Not with, like,

20:54.711 --> 20:57.339
bodily harm. He just implied
that unless we hire his crew,

20:57.381 --> 20:59.216
he'll make sure
our project never makes it

20:59.258 --> 21:01.176
onto the city council calendar
for approval.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.886
Why didn't you just
tell me this?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.305
I wanted to,
but I was embarrassed

21:05.347 --> 21:07.474
that I got us into this mess.
Hey.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.476
Bro, we are partners.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.478
We handle problems together.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.689
Now you set up a meeting
for the three of us.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.315
I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.943
What if he calls his guy
at the city council office?

21:17.985 --> 21:20.237
He's just acting tough.
When I worked for Ada Stone,

21:20.279 --> 21:22.072
I met guys like him
all the time.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.448
They back down
once you call them on it.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.242
He's not gonna
bully us around.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.577
I got important friends, too.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.373
Okay, drink
plenty of water.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.582
(groans softly)

21:32.624 --> 21:33.709
Easy. Easy.
Sorry.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.419
Huh?
Oh.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.506
I'm okay. Really, I-I just

21:39.548 --> 21:42.009
need a minute.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.011
Cristal,

21:44.052 --> 21:45.971
being brave is not gonna shrink
this tumor any faster.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.848
If you're already
feeling the effects

21:47.889 --> 21:51.310
of this after a few treatments,
it's going to be impossible

21:51.351 --> 21:53.437
to hide it from Blake
for much longer.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.896
What if we tell
him together?

21:54.938 --> 21:56.982
Would that be easier?
No.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.068
It's something
I have to do on my own.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.738
I know that.
I'm just waiting for the...

22:02.779 --> 22:04.740
Perfect time.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.701
Cristal, there is
no perfect time.
I'll figure it out.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.370
I really think you need to talk
to someone... besides me.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.873
You're-you're not talking
to your family, and-and...

22:12.914 --> 22:14.958
Can you please just stop?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.544
It's none of your business
who I talk to about this.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.504
When we're here,
you're just my doctor.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.298
That's all.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.175
Just pretend you don't know
anything else about me.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.469
And I will tell Blake
when I'm good and ready.

Clark Kent thing going on.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.086
I can wear them again tonight
when we get home.
Mm.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.962
But I'm gonna head
to the senator's office.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.547
You know what to do?

23:02.589 --> 23:03.965

23:05.550 --> 23:07.844
What?

23:07.886 --> 23:09.971
Little spy humor. I'm out.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.810
ALEXIS:
So I slapped him.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.270
And I said, "Antoni,
if you can't behave,

23:17.312 --> 23:19.481
I'm just gonna have to put
you at the kids' table."

23:19.523 --> 23:21.233
(laughs)
Yes, that story
still kills me

23:21.274 --> 23:23.110
no matter how many times
you tell it.

23:23.151 --> 23:27.697
Elsie, did I ever tell you

What do you think you're doing?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.065
I'm Dominique Deveraux.
Big fan.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.151
I know you're one
of the top buyers

24:04.192 --> 24:06.236
in the country, and I know
your time is valuable,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.405
but instead of making you go

24:08.447 --> 24:10.824
to a fashion show,
I brought one to you.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.284
What do you think?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.953
Very impressive.
Seriously?

24:14.995 --> 24:18.123
I do love how
you stripped down the excess,

24:18.165 --> 24:19.875
and the triadic
scheme is...

24:19.916 --> 24:21.918
striking.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.045
Striking.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.924
I could definitely sell this
to several high-end retailers

24:27.966 --> 24:30.760
as a luxury seasonal collection.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.429
So you mean you'll buy the line?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.097
You can't be serious.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.601
I recognize talent
when I see it.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.769
You have something here.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.689
And I'll have a few suggestions
and changes,

24:42.731 --> 24:45.734
but I think
we can work together.

24:45.775 --> 24:46.985
(laughs)

24:47.027 --> 24:48.403
(indistinct chatter)

24:48.445 --> 24:49.779
I'm on my break.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.114
Ugh.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.866
MAN:
Mrs. North. Hey.
(gasps)

24:52.908 --> 24:54.034
How y'all doing?
MRS. NORTH:
It's nice to see you.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.118
Liam?

24:55.160 --> 24:56.953
The Eagle has landed.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.122
LIAM: What?
FALLON: North's headed inside.
Are you done?

24:59.164 --> 25:00.624
LIAM:
No, I had to start up
his computer first.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.042
Who actually shuts down
their computer?

25:02.083 --> 25:03.376
Just stall him.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.920
How?

25:04.961 --> 25:06.254
I don't know.
This was your plan, remember?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.381
Uh...

25:14.221 --> 25:16.223
(door opens)

25:16.264 --> 25:18.225
Adam, is that you?

25:18.266 --> 25:20.143
Would you come in here
for a second?
(door closes)

25:21.478 --> 25:22.479
Sit down.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.272
If it's all the same to you,

25:24.314 --> 25:26.024
I'd rather go change.
It's been a long day.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.443
You need to tell me what's
going on with Cristal right now.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.153
I don't know what you mean.
Come on. Cut the crap.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.863
I know she didn't go
to the clinic today.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.989
She's hiding something,
and you're covering for her.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.366
What is it?

25:34.407 --> 25:36.284
Father,
if you're having problems

25:36.326 --> 25:38.203
with your wife, you should
probably talk to her about it.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.163
She's keeping secrets again.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.832
And the last time I ignored
the signs, I almost lost her,

25:42.874 --> 25:46.545
which is why
I need your help, son.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.548
Please.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.641
There's no one else
in her life, but,

25:59.683 --> 26:05.230
hypothetically speaking, if
she'd seen me as her physician,

26:05.272 --> 26:08.400
I wouldn't be able to break
doctor-patient confidentiality.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.444
I'm gonna leave my stuff
here and make some tea.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.446
When I come back
in a few minutes,

26:13.488 --> 26:16.199
this file is going
back in my case.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.660
Okay.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.311
(distant chatter)

26:44.352 --> 26:45.437
(phone chimes)

26:45.478 --> 26:47.647
Um, excuse me, Senator?

26:47.689 --> 26:50.025
Hi. Daphne Green. I don't
believe we've had the pleasure.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.027
Oh, Ms. Green,
how nice to meet you.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.779
But the party's outside.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.448
I just need to pop
into my office for a moment

26:56.489 --> 26:57.866
to get something,
so I'll see you out there.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.159
Oh, your office is right there?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.994
Um, I was hoping
that we could,

27:01.036 --> 27:02.996
you know, grab a drink and talk

27:03.038 --> 27:05.332
about starting a political
action committee to raise

27:05.373 --> 27:07.125
some money for
your campaign.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.127
I was thinking-- I don't know--

27:09.169 --> 27:11.963
maybe, um, a million dollars
in seed money?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.923
Daphne, was it?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.800
I always have time for a drink
with a constituent.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.762
Uh, Senator, a word?

27:18.803 --> 27:22.849
Oh, Daphne, this is my chief
of staff, Katy Lofflan. Katy,

27:22.891 --> 27:26.019
Daphne here was just discussing
a PAC that she wants to start.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.729
So let's all go downstairs,
you know?

27:27.771 --> 27:30.273
Let's grab a drink,
and talk about PACs, man.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.109
(laughs)
Sir, I need to speak
to you in your office.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.944
Uh, excuse me, won't you?

27:34.986 --> 27:36.821
Okay. I guess we're all going
into your office.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.281
Did everybody hear that? We're
going to the office right now.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.371
Uh-oh.
KATY:
Senator,

27:44.412 --> 27:46.956
this is Liam Ridley,
John Lowden's son.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.334
He tripped the silent alarm
sneaking in here, and

27:49.376 --> 27:53.088
we caught him trying to download
information from your computer.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.090
What do you mean
he snuck in? How?

27:55.131 --> 27:57.425
Well, he did have some help

27:57.467 --> 28:00.136
from his wife,
Fallon Carrington.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.722
Well, this is awkward.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.475
Hi, babe.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.731
You can lie all you want.
We know the truth.

28:11.773 --> 28:13.274
When my father tried
to expose you

28:13.316 --> 28:14.734
for insider trading,
you had him taken out.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.444
Okay, I think that's enough.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.321
Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should go.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.281
NORTH:
No, you're not
going anywhere.

28:20.323 --> 28:21.741
Oh, I want to hear this.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.868
What exactly
are you accusing me of?

28:23.910 --> 28:25.078
I have a transcript
of an interview

28:25.120 --> 28:26.996
from a former employee of yours,

28:27.038 --> 28:29.207
and it's pretty damn clear that
this office would do anything

28:29.249 --> 28:31.668
to save itself from getting
caught in that scandal.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.671
So, you are accusing
a sitting U.S. senator

28:34.713 --> 28:37.257
of murder? You know, we could
have you arrested right now.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.717
No, you just
gave the order.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.885
You let Sabino do
your dirty work for you.

28:40.927 --> 28:43.847
You think Louis Sabino
killed your father on my orders?

28:43.888 --> 28:45.682
FALLON:
Well, why else would you
have paid him

28:45.724 --> 28:47.809
a hundred grand just
after Liam's dad died?

28:47.851 --> 28:50.019
Because he runs
a cancer foundation.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.897
One to which I donate
every year.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.066
Well, maybe he kills someone
for you every year.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.236
Okay, I think we're done here.
I need to get back

28:58.278 --> 29:00.280
to my guests.
Katy, will you, uh...?
No, hold on, hold on, hold on.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.365
Wait, wait, wait.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.159
I mean, what
about the hacking?

29:04.200 --> 29:05.744
We know that you
guys have been

29:05.785 --> 29:07.287
reading Liam's emails, so
how do you explain that?

29:07.328 --> 29:08.955
KATY:
I can explain.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.833
Our security team
has been monitoring

29:11.875 --> 29:14.002
Mr. Ridley's email account,

29:14.043 --> 29:17.130
but only after
he started stalking the senator.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.591
No.
We deemed him
a credible threat,

29:19.632 --> 29:22.510
and so, we got a warrant
for some limited surveillance.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.053
Oh, I'm the threat?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.805
And I'm supposed to believe

29:25.847 --> 29:28.099
that my father just fell off
that boat and drowned?

29:29.517 --> 29:32.562
Liam, your father and I
were friends,

29:32.604 --> 29:36.941
but we both know that he made
some questionable choices.

29:36.983 --> 29:39.235
When the SEC came after him,

29:39.277 --> 29:41.112
things got very,
very dark, right?

29:41.154 --> 29:44.407
But there was no conspiracy,
no murder.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.076
Just a broken man
and a tragic accident.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.955
I know it would be easier
if you could blame someone.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.458
Now, because
of who you are,

29:53.500 --> 29:54.918
I'm going to ask security
to escort you

29:54.959 --> 29:56.920
off the premises,

29:56.961 --> 29:58.922
and we'll forget
this ever happened.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.465
Unless you'd rather go to jail.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.883
No, no, no.
We're okay.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.176
Thank you,
Senator. Come on.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.639
Oh, and Ms. Carrington...

30:08.807 --> 30:10.391
...I'll be looking forward
to that donation.

30:10.433 --> 30:15.355
Yeah. That was kind of
more Daphne's idea, but okay.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.732
Yup, you'll have it
by the end of the week.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.737
(footsteps approaching)

30:24.322 --> 30:25.740
Hi there.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.202
What's wrong?

30:29.244 --> 30:31.663
I know about the tumor, Cristal.
I'm so sorry.

30:31.704 --> 30:32.914
Blake,

30:32.956 --> 30:34.082
how do you

30:34.123 --> 30:36.501
even...? Adam.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.419
No, Adam didn't
tell me anything.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.839
I saw your medical file
in his bag, and I'm glad I did.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.257
Are you okay?
Well,

30:42.298 --> 30:44.259
I have cancer,

30:44.300 --> 30:45.927
so I'm not great.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.762
You should have
told me about this.
Excuse me?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.013
I'm your husband.
You should have told me.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.266
Well, this isn't
about you, Blake.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.892
No, it's not.
It's about us being partners,

30:52.934 --> 30:54.352
or at least
we're supposed to be.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.479
There wasn't anything to tell.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.566
I'm trying
these experimental treatments,

30:59.607 --> 31:01.234
and I didn't want you to worry.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.986
Should have had a conversation
about this.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.904
This is life and death,
and you completely cut me out.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.656
Now might be too late
for me to do anything.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.658
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.661
Because you try to take charge
and make it all about you.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.788
How is me trying
to save your life a bad thing?

31:13.830 --> 31:15.373
(groans softly)

31:15.415 --> 31:17.250
Where are you going?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.252
I can't talk to you when
you're being irrational.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.920
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I not being rational

31:20.962 --> 31:22.505
after finding out
my wife is dying?

31:22.547 --> 31:24.048
I need to go.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.550
Sure, you just run away

31:25.592 --> 31:28.261
when things get tough,
just like always.

31:29.178 --> 31:32.098
(footsteps approaching)

31:32.140 --> 31:34.767
Well, how'd it go?
Was Elsie Von impressed?

31:34.809 --> 31:36.519
It went perfectly.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.313
She made me an offer
for the line.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.815
That's incredible.
Congratulations.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.442
I turned her down.
What?

31:42.483 --> 31:45.278
You know, just when I think
I understand you...

31:45.320 --> 31:47.697
Talking to you about Lo
made me take another look

31:47.739 --> 31:49.198
at her sketchbook.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.075
She designed
beautiful pieces,

31:51.117 --> 31:54.370
but mostly, she made clothes
for you and Monica.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.080
Yeah. Since we couldn't keep up

31:56.122 --> 31:57.540
with the other rich kids
at school,

31:57.582 --> 31:59.167
she decided
she'd make 'em herself

31:59.208 --> 32:01.586
and told us
to call them "custom."

32:01.628 --> 32:05.298
Elsie already wanted to charge
a fortune in high-end stores.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.300
Isn't that the goal?

32:07.342 --> 32:09.761
I thought it was,
but now I realize it's not.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.554
That's not what Mom wanted.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.015
She designed clothes
for everyone.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.850
I want to do the same.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.478
Wow. That's, uh,
so not like you.

32:18.519 --> 32:21.147
Maybe I am growing.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.484
I mean, Elsie also wanted
to make some design changes

32:24.525 --> 32:27.195
that were
hideous, so now,

32:27.236 --> 32:30.073
I just need to find
an affordable manufacturer

32:30.114 --> 32:31.783
that can keep the cost down.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.993
Let me do it.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.995
Maybe it's time Colby Co.

32:36.037 --> 32:37.455
gets in the fashion game.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.459
Jeff, I'm not asking
you for money.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.711
Which is exactly why I offered.

32:43.753 --> 32:46.965
And this way,
we can keep it in the family.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.092
I think
Lo would have liked that.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.302
(both laugh)

32:52.929 --> 32:56.057
She would have loved it,

32:56.099 --> 32:58.226
just like I do.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.186
(laughs)

33:05.024 --> 33:07.568
Can I get you a plate?
Nope.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.488
Rough night.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.532
Found out
what Cristal's been hiding.
I know.

33:12.573 --> 33:16.202
And so does anyone within
a two-mile radius, I'm afraid.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.204
I'm sorry.
Thought I was prepared
for anything.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.124
Didn't expect
to be so hurt and angry.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.126
It surprised me.
I think

33:23.167 --> 33:24.669
your reaction was stronger
than you expected

33:24.711 --> 33:26.337
for other reasons, as well.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.964
What are you talking about?

33:28.006 --> 33:29.716
It's not enough
for Cristal to be sick?
Yes.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.927
But you're afraid of losing
someone you love... again.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.595
There's a reason why

33:34.637 --> 33:36.431
you can't get back
in the cockpit.

33:36.472 --> 33:39.058
Being around those planes
again must remind you of her.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.102
Anders...
The accident was awful.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.104
Daisy was your girlfriend, yes,

33:43.146 --> 33:45.481
but she was also
a trained pilot.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.984
Well, that doesn't change
what happened.
The crash

33:48.026 --> 33:51.696
wasn't your fault.
It was a force of nature.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.281
You may have been
flying the plane,

33:53.322 --> 33:54.866
but there was nothing
you could've done.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.076
Her death was just
a tragedy.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.412
There are things that even
Blake Carrington can't control.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.414
It feels like I'm back
in the pilot's seat again,

34:01.456 --> 34:04.625
watching the plane go down,
helpless.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.586
That's because you are.

34:06.627 --> 34:09.338
Not your best pep talk.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.758
You can't stop Cristal
from dying.

34:11.799 --> 34:15.178
But you can at least be
by her side.

34:16.804 --> 34:20.349
If you're scared, imagine
what she's going through.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.770
As Sam told you,
we appreciate your offer

34:23.811 --> 34:25.313
to help us
with the construction permits.

34:25.354 --> 34:26.898
Happy to do it.

34:26.939 --> 34:29.525
Anything for a client.
Unfortunately, we won't

34:29.567 --> 34:30.818
be able to hire your crew.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.111
I understand
that means

34:32.153 --> 34:33.529
we'll lose
your connections,

34:33.571 --> 34:35.865
but we'll navigate
the city council ourselves.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.492
It's nothing personal.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.368
Sounds personal.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.370
Especially since I explained
the situation pretty clearly

34:41.412 --> 34:42.705
to your partner here.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.332
You were clear, yes.

34:44.373 --> 34:45.875
MICHAEL:
He told me about
your threats.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.710
Sounds a lot
like racketeering to me.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.379
I got an idea.

34:50.421 --> 34:52.590
Why don't we call the new
chief of police?

34:52.632 --> 34:54.634
See what he thinks?
The police chief?

34:54.675 --> 34:57.470
An old friend.
Atlantix season ticket holder.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.263
I know people.

34:59.305 --> 35:00.932
You didn't see that coming,
did you?

35:00.973 --> 35:03.601
(line ringing)

35:03.643 --> 35:05.186
CHIEF:
Leo?

35:05.228 --> 35:07.271
Hey, Chief, just checking in,

35:07.313 --> 35:09.440
making sure we're still on
for dinner this week.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.942
As long as you're still paying.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.777
(laughs)
Of course.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.862
Give my best to Sandy.
CHIEF:
I will.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.739
See you in a few days.
CHIEF:
See you then.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.117
I know people, too.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.619
Here's the thing.

35:21.661 --> 35:25.873
You may own this club,
but I'm running the show.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.252
Which means
you will be using my crew.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.254
Is that going
to be a problem?

35:31.295 --> 35:32.964
I think we can work with that.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.175
How about you, tough guy?

35:37.135 --> 35:40.138
Yeah. I'm good.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.057
Whew. (laughs)

35:43.099 --> 35:45.268
Glad that's settled.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.479
Hey, what's with
the sad faces?

35:48.521 --> 35:50.857
We're like family now.

35:50.898 --> 35:54.610
This place is going
to look amazing when we're done.

35:54.652 --> 35:56.696
My guys are the best.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.532
See you Monday.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.953
(door opens)

36:03.995 --> 36:05.329
That went well.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.747
(door closes)

36:06.789 --> 36:08.332
Now what?
I don't know.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.585
Next time you want
to hire an organized crime boss,

36:10.626 --> 36:12.253
a little heads-up would be nice.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.013
Sorry. I just wanted
to check in.

36:22.054 --> 36:26.225
I heard you and Blake fight,
and I just want to explain.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.936
You don't have
to explain anything.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.355
Blake had to find out
sooner or later.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.566
I just wish I'd listened
to you in the first place.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.318
I have some good news.

36:35.359 --> 36:39.030
The treatment seems
to be working.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.573
Really?
Somewhat, yes.

36:40.615 --> 36:44.035
The tumor hasn't shrunk enough
yet to operate, but

36:44.076 --> 36:46.329
if things keep progressing
like this, I'm optimistic

36:46.370 --> 36:47.622
we can remove it safely.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.665
I wish I shared your optimism.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.001
I get that.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.420
This is real progress.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.797
I'll, um...
I'll leave you guys to it.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.425
Blake, I...

36:59.467 --> 37:01.260
Can we start over again?

37:01.302 --> 37:03.888
I just want
to be here for you.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.015
I got angry because, um...

37:08.643 --> 37:11.103
...I'm terrified by the thought
of losing you again.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.108
And apparently, dealing with
loss is not one of my strengths.

37:16.150 --> 37:17.693
That makes two of us.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.904
I should have told you
what was going on,

37:19.946 --> 37:22.490
but that would've meant
admitting this is real,

37:22.531 --> 37:24.742
and that scares me.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.535
Yeah, I know. I know.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.663
I'm scared, too. I am.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.667
(sighs)

37:33.876 --> 37:36.796
But you and I are gonna
tackle this thing together.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.800
Okay?

37:40.841 --> 37:42.802
Okay.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.721
But that's a problem
for tomorrow.

37:45.763 --> 37:50.059
What do you say
we live a little tonight, huh?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.979
I have an 1811 bottle
of Château d'Yquem

37:53.020 --> 37:55.523
that I paid six figures for

37:55.564 --> 37:57.858
which I've been saving
for a special night.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.821
Let's make that night tonight.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.657
(panting)

38:06.534 --> 38:08.035
What are you doing?

38:08.077 --> 38:10.830
That was a setback,
but I just got a reply

38:10.871 --> 38:12.540
from another informant
who said he has North's

38:12.581 --> 38:14.834
old BlackBerry,
so if-if I can just...

38:14.875 --> 38:16.877
Stop it.
You can't be serious.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.671
I want my husband back.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.548
You promised me
you would drop this.
Yes.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.133
Once the investigation is over.

38:22.174 --> 38:23.676
It's not over, Fallon.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.678
Yes, it is!

38:25.720 --> 38:27.763
Liam, enough is enough.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.599
You have to accept
that you were wrong.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.893
And I know you don't want
to hear that, but...

38:36.230 --> 38:39.817
Every crazy scheme of yours,
I have always had your back.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.152
And-and now
that I am trying

38:41.193 --> 38:43.195
to exonerate my murdered father,

38:43.237 --> 38:44.780
what, you're just giving up
on me?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.198
I do have your back.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.533
(scoffs)
That is what I am trying

38:47.575 --> 38:49.160
to explain to you.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.578
Your father

38:50.619 --> 38:52.413
was not murdered,
and we don't know

38:52.455 --> 38:54.415
what he's guilty of.
He wasn't exactly a saint.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.542
But you cannot rewrite history.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.503
You are searching for an answer
that is not there!

38:59.545 --> 39:01.339
I'm not giving up on this.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.592
You need to accept reality.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.802
The only reason
you are not giving up

39:06.844 --> 39:09.263
is because you don't want
to admit that you failed.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.265
But if you want
to keep making things up,

39:11.307 --> 39:13.434
and you want to live
in a fantasy world, that's fine,

39:13.476 --> 39:15.728
but maybe you should go back
to writing fiction.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.608
I got to go.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.485
Liam...

39:24.695 --> 39:26.530
(music playing faintly)

39:26.572 --> 39:28.949
You have some nerve,

39:28.991 --> 39:30.951
embarrassing me in front
of my friends like that

39:30.993 --> 39:32.703
with your little game
of dress-up.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.830
Save it.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.874
I know you sabotaged me.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.459
You hired that fake

39:38.501 --> 39:41.712
Clark Hoffman assistant,
but it didn't work.

39:41.754 --> 39:44.340
You failed... as usual.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.593
Oh, Dominique, sometimes I wish
I lived in your fantasy world.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.304
As soon as Michael told me
he had mentioned Clark to you,

39:50.346 --> 39:53.015
it didn't take long for me
to put the pieces together.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.267
Is there a point to this,
or are you just lonely?

39:55.309 --> 39:56.727
The point is,

39:56.769 --> 39:58.646
I know your secret.

39:58.687 --> 40:01.065
And if you ever try this again,
I'll use it.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.942
I wonder how
Fallon would react,

40:02.983 --> 40:07.321
knowing you've been hiding her
half-sibling all these years?

40:07.363 --> 40:09.281
She would probably be upset.

40:09.323 --> 40:12.743
But not nearly as upset as
your children when they find out

40:12.785 --> 40:15.329
you're still married and
haven't stopped lying to them.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.332
I already told you,
I made that up to...
Yes.

40:18.374 --> 40:22.336
To bait me, but I didn't
buy that, so I looked into it.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.380
And what do you know?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.757
You are still married

40:26.799 --> 40:28.801
to Mr. Brady Lloyd.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.636
And to think,

40:30.678 --> 40:33.681
just when you and Jeff were
finally getting along,

40:33.722 --> 40:35.599
another betrayal.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.518
I should have left you
in the bottom of that mine.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.854
Probably, but you didn't.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.898
Which means you better watch who
you mess with moving forward.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.943
I think we're done here.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.870
Well, I just need a few
more solo flying hours,

40:55.911 --> 40:57.872
and then I'm done.

40:57.913 --> 41:00.541
And Anders is qualified
to be an instructor?
Yeah.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.334
I think he flew in one
of the World Wars or something.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.711
Anyway,

41:03.752 --> 41:05.379
once I get my license,

41:05.421 --> 41:07.506
you and I can fly anywhere
we want.

41:07.548 --> 41:10.050
Just the two of us.
That sounds nice.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.594
Yeah.

41:11.635 --> 41:14.388
Mm. Sorry.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.224
Mm. Just got
a little woozy.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.935
Give me just a second.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.772
Oh, Cristal!

41:23.814 --> 41:27.359
Help! Help!

41:28.819 --> 41:30.488
(dog barking)

41:30.529 --> 41:33.282
Hey.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.825
Are you...?

41:36.368 --> 41:38.579
(grunting)
(tires squealing)

41:38.621 --> 41:41.373
Get off me!
(groaning)

41:41.415 --> 41:42.666
Get off!

41:42.708 --> 41:45.002
(groaning)

41:47.630 --> 41:49.673
(engine revving)
