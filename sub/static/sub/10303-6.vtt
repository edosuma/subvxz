01:15.600 --> 01:17.272
Last time on Married With Children...

01:17.480 --> 01:20.040
...I was neither fed, walk ed
or had a close-up.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.593
That's better.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.512
Last time on Married With Children...

01:24.760 --> 01:27.911
...AI was having a typical day
at the shoe store, when suddenly:

01:28.160 --> 01:30.958
Oh, what in Sam Hill are you doing?

01:31.360 --> 01:34.511
- I'm breast-feeding.
- But why?

01:34.760 --> 01:36.830
Because he can't cook.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.070
You just told me it was all right
if I fed him.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.949
Well, I meant to give him something
healthy, like an Orange Bang.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.074
Al made the lady leave,
but only temporarily.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.153
How dare you deny her
her God-given right to nurse her baby...

01:50.360 --> 01:52.510
...whenever Mother Nature calls!

01:53.320 --> 01:56.357
Breast-feeding is a natural
biological function.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.160
So is peeing, but you don't see me
doing that in public.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.431
Al stuck by his guns on this one...

02:03.640 --> 02:05.995
...so you know his life could've
only gotten better.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.271
Company halt!

02:09.520 --> 02:12.193
Present babies.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.073
Express milk.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.669
So, Al had no choice...

02:21.880 --> 02:24.440
...but to counterprotest
in his usual classy manner.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.199
Present.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.396
Beer bellies.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.268
Boogie down.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.068
And now, despite
my vehement objections...

02:49.320 --> 02:51.231
...Married With Children continues.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.199
One, two, three, four
We will breast-feed in your store

02:54.440 --> 02:57.750
Two, four, six, eight
Hide your breasts or...

02:59.400 --> 03:00.719
Wait, what rhymes with eight?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.112
- Get a date?
- Guess my weight.

03:03.360 --> 03:04.998
Urinate.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.954
Well, this past week there have been
two fires, a flood and a mass murder.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.237
Unfortunately, none of them here
at Gary's Shoes...

03:14.480 --> 03:17.995
...where I, Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

03:18.240 --> 03:21.391
...have been since
this breast-feeding protest began.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.959
But since I am here...

03:23.200 --> 03:26.317
...I might as well speak to the leader
of the counterdemonstration.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.996
A former high school football player,
current shoe salesman...

03:30.240 --> 03:34.552
...and future food-stamp abuser,
Al Bundy.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.236
Mr. Bundy, what is your group trying
to achieve here?

03:38.440 --> 03:40.829
We wanna show that men have
a God-given right...

03:41.040 --> 03:43.918
...to live
in a breast-free environment.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.068
Don't get us wrong.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.590
We're not some of those sissy marys
who don't like breasts.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.035
I mean, I'm not.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.553
Of course, I can't vouch
for these other guys.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.952
Our point is breasts have no place
in a women's shoe store.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.158
Unless they're on a pinup calendar
in a bathroom.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.829
Or in one of them pens
where the bathing suit disappears.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.839
Mr. Bundy, sorry to break up
the Mensa meeting...

04:14.080 --> 04:17.709
...but how does your wife feel
about this protest?

04:17.959 --> 04:19.951
Oh, I'm not married.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.468
But if I was married,
I'm sure she'd be here for me.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.594
Hi, Al.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.549
Hello, woman I've never seen before.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.951
Oh, yeah, here you wear the bag,
but in bed...

04:43.160 --> 04:46.948
If you two don't mind, I'll head over
to the other wing of the asylum.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.357
- Here she comes, girls.
- Look fertile and oppressed.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.872
Hi, honey. Brought you your lunch.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.556
It's just three pieces of bread, Peg.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.275
Yeah, it's a club sandwich,
hold the "club."

05:03.240 --> 05:05.834
Oh, I'd like to hold the club, Peg.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.119
Oh, well, I guess it's better
than yesterday's hot-dog bun on rye.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.710
Now, look, Al, I know I'm not supposed
to ask you about your business...

05:13.920 --> 05:14.955
...or your future...

05:15.160 --> 05:18.470
...or why there's never a pair of your
dirty underwear in the hamper...

05:18.680 --> 05:21.035
...but just how long
is this protest gonna continue?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.197
Until we've made our point, Peg.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.597
Which shouldn't be long once these
women realize how united we men are.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.554
- Food!
- Hey, burgers! Come on!

05:30.560 --> 05:32.790
What...?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.594
Hey, you're supposed to bring
the food back to us...

05:35.840 --> 05:37.432
...not eat it all yourself.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.148
I hit a red light on the way back.

05:41.280 --> 05:45.353
Now, look, Al, you've been gone
a week and I miss you.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.312
There's no one to take
the trash out...

05:47.560 --> 05:50.279
...and sex without you
just isn't the same.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.670
Well, actually it is.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.917
I want this protest
to be over right now.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.196
Marcie, get over here.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.512
Now, how long have
we been friends?

06:00.720 --> 06:03.234
What, me and you, or me and her?

06:03.520 --> 06:05.431
You and soap.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.277
Why don't you just drop
this whole thing?

06:09.480 --> 06:11.596
Don't worry, Peggy,
this will all be over soon.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.992
Al and I have already found a way
to settle our differences.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.878
Our philosophical ones.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.469
The physical ones
are still too close to call.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.957
Actually, the key was
to find someone...

06:23.160 --> 06:25.151
...who could track down
what the law says.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.960
Someone neutral,
with no more loyalty to Al than to me.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.555
So we picked your son, Bud.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.552
And when he gets back,
we'll find out...

06:32.760 --> 06:36.116
...that this is still the United States
of America, where men have rights.

06:36.320 --> 06:40.393
That's why George Washington chopped
down that tree, called it macaroni.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.670
That's why George Hamilton
and Raymond Burr...

06:42.880 --> 06:44.950
...fought their famous duel.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.715
And that's why a lot of other guys
did a lot of other stuff.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.354
Believe me, Marcie, my government
would never rule against me.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.068
Dad, they ruled against you.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.994
Damn George Washington!
I wish he was dead!

06:59.240 --> 07:01.913
- We won! We won! We won!
- We won! We won!

07:02.160 --> 07:04.230
Well, it looks like Sucklegate...

07:04.480 --> 07:08.189
...much like my career,
has finally come to an end.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.477
This is Miranda Veracruz
de la Jolla Cardenal...

07:11.720 --> 07:15.759
...saying good night and yikes.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.718
Oh, gee, Al, I know you really put
a lot into this protest.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.359
I'm sorry you lost.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.630
Thanks, Peg.
I knew that you'd understand.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.553
You know what I love
about America in the '90s?

07:39.800 --> 07:41.836
Jockey for Her?

07:42.680 --> 07:46.753
No. It's that people like you
never get what they want.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.194
It's so amusing to watch.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.472
You try, but things
just never go your way.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.597
That's what makes
this country great.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.518
I don't care what the law says!
I do what I want, Marcie!

07:57.760 --> 08:00.069
I laugh at the law!

08:12.960 --> 08:16.635
Hello, officer.
What brings you here?

08:16.840 --> 08:18.273
The law.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.715
You know, that thing
you were just laughing at.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.791
Come on, Dan, you're a guy.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.758
I'm a cop first, Al.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.912
Well, actually I'm a cop about 11 th.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.948
I'm a lover first,
and then a bowler...

08:32.200 --> 08:34.236
...then a lover again.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.432
And then sometimes late at night
I like to pretend I'm Barney...

08:37.679 --> 08:39.635
...on Mission Impossible.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.111
But anyway, I'm here to uphold the law.
It's the job I've sworn to do.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.070
Officer! Someone's being mugged
in the food court!

08:48.320 --> 08:50.595
Tell someone who cares.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.915
Anyway, the law says you can't stop
a woman from breast-feeding.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.116
Sorry, Bundy, but we live in an age...

08:58.320 --> 09:00.515
...where everyone's rights
have to be respected.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.551
Especially mine.

09:05.440 --> 09:11.231
That's why I've got seven citations here
for indecent exposure.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.639
But there's only six of us.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.440
I know. I gave you two.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.630
Come on.
What's he talking about, "indecent"?

09:22.880 --> 09:25.519
I mean, we don't look so bad.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.998
When did being born a man
become a crime?

09:37.240 --> 09:40.710
Well, according to
The People of Illinois v. Baby Hayes...

09:40.960 --> 09:43.793
...it was May 12th, 1992.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.069
Baby Hayes?

09:45.360 --> 09:47.237
Yeah, he was born naked.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.634
The nurse didn't like it,
sued him for sexual harassment.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.677
They tried him as an adult...

09:55.400 --> 09:57.595
...and gave him
the electric highchair.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.955
You'll be seeing it on Fox.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.994
In all honesty, why are you surprised
in having to see breast-feeding?

10:07.200 --> 10:09.350
I mean, after all,
this is a women's shoe store.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.637
It is, isn't it?

10:15.880 --> 10:19.270
Yeah, Dad, and hold onto your hairline,
you are a woman's shoe salesman.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.358
I am, aren't I?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.517
Well, that's enough for today.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.832
I'll break the Dodge and Mom
to you some other time.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.836
Son, you just gave me a great idea.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.514
I know how to get
around the law, Marcie...

10:36.760 --> 10:41.038
...and her cud-chewing comrades
permanently.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.431
- Hey, Griff.
- Hey.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.874
- Dad.
- Son...

10:56.080 --> 11:00.232
...welcome to Gary's Shoes
and Accessories for Today's Man.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.233
It even says so on the sign. See?

11:09.120 --> 11:11.475
Dad, the imprint of the W and the O
are still there.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.797
Well, that's the way
it is with women, see?

11:15.480 --> 11:17.710
Their imprint is always there.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.309
But, son, don't you see the genius
of what I've done?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.278
Now that I just sell men's shoes...

11:22.520 --> 11:25.637
...I never have to worry about women
coming in the store at all.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.036
I need shoes!

11:28.880 --> 11:32.350
Sorry, ma'am,
but this is now a man's shoe store.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.909
- I need shoes.
- Right this way.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.472
Well, at least we know
she's not gonna breast-feed.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.629
But my idea is genius.
Just listen to the silence.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.037
Hey, Al.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.673
Listen, I came by to warn you...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.110
...Marcie's as mad
as a wet hen about this.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.875
Well, that means somewhere out there,
there's a wet hen as mad as Marcie.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.310
Look, you know
she's not gonna give up on this.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.557
I mean, when she sinks her teeth
into something...

12:19.200 --> 12:22.909
Well, if you wanna step
in the backroom, I'll show you.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.710
No! That's okay,
I'll do a silent scream from here.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.194
But I'm glad she's mad at me.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.676
That'll teach her
to get into a milking contest with me.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.668
Get that, son.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.839
Oh, and if it's your mother, tell her
I've remarried and she gets the kids.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.557
I feel good. Yep, I do.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.035
Hey, Al, aren't you afraid
that Gary will find out...

12:50.240 --> 12:52.390
...that you turned this
into a men's shoe store?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.272
Who's Gary?

12:55.760 --> 12:57.990
You know, Gary of Gary's Shoes.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.390
Jefferson, I've worked here
20 years...

13:04.680 --> 13:07.433
Twenty years?
Where the hell has my life gone?

13:08.160 --> 13:12.199
But anyway, I've never even seen Gary.
I don't even know if the Gary exists.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.592
But I haven't been this happy in years.
Let me just sit back and revel in it.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.515
Dad, that was Gary's office
on the phone.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.630
Gary's flying in the day after tomorrow
to take a personal look at the store.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.751
Hello, La Crappe Shoe Distributors?

13:40.840 --> 13:44.594
Yeah. I'm Al Bundy.
I returned $20,000 worth of shoes.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.990
Okay, 20,000 pesos.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.632
Look, I need them back today.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.070
Three weeks?
Look, you don't understand. My boss...

13:52.280 --> 13:55.431
Hey, don't "ay caramba" me
in that sarcastic tone!

13:55.920 --> 13:58.434
Now, I need those sh... Hello?!

14:03.000 --> 14:05.355
Oh, Dad, so you traded
your women's shoes...

14:05.600 --> 14:07.636
...for men's shoes
without telling your boss.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.519
It's not like when you bought
that $200 bowling ball...

14:10.720 --> 14:12.472
...and you didn't tell Mom.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.949
Now, that would be trouble.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.474
Well, thank you, pumpkin.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.319
You just spoiled
your mother's birthday present.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.189
And let's not spoil
your father's birthday present.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.039
He's getting a cocktail dress.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.754
Quiet down, the two of you!
I gotta think.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.037
Leave the wife. Leave the wife.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.111
Gary's coming. Gary's coming.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.557
Peg, you just gave me an idea.
You have shoes. Lots of shoes.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.360
I can sell them. Give them to me.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.191
No! I need them.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.159
Well, what does a woman need
with over 200 pairs of shoes?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.719
Well, let's start with the black ones.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.474
You know, black is a basic,
so you need all the styles.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.918
I have black flats for casual outfits,
black mules for lounging...

15:07.160 --> 15:08.991
...black clogs for that retro look...

15:09.240 --> 15:11.629
...oh, and my black heels
for dressy occasions.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.154
- Kelly, come with me.
- Okay.

15:13.360 --> 15:17.353
And then there's the black boots,
cowboy boots for boot cut jeans...

15:17.600 --> 15:20.512
...English riding boots
for tweedy suits and skirts...

15:20.760 --> 15:23.558
...and yes, shoe boots,
for when you want that boot look...

15:23.760 --> 15:26.593
...but you just can't commit
to the whole boot experience.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.360
I tell you,
and then it goes on from there...

15:37.960 --> 15:40.155
How do I do it?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.792
I am a genius.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.310
Would you have known
that five minutes ago...

15:45.520 --> 15:47.078
...this was a man's shoe?

15:50.120 --> 15:52.190
Well, yeah.

15:52.520 --> 15:57.992
I defy anyone else to tell me
that these aren't real ladies' shoes.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.798
Pumpkin, let me explain again
what I want you to do here for me.

16:02.040 --> 16:07.114
Now, when Gary comes in, I want you
to act like you're a customer.

16:07.360 --> 16:12.514
If you do a good job, Gary will think
that these are really ladies' shoes.

16:14.160 --> 16:19.075
And then Daddy won't have to wrestle
old women for government cheese.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.436
Can you do that
for Daddy, pumpkin?

16:22.880 --> 16:26.350
Well, I don't know.
How tough are these old women?

16:29.080 --> 16:31.116
You know,
I really think we can pull this off.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.993
Even if women can tell
that these aren't women's shoes...

16:34.200 --> 16:36.589
...Gary won't know the difference.
He's a man.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.798
Hi, I'm Gary. I own this store.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.317
Of course.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.591
Excuse me, Mr. Shoe Daddy...

16:49.600 --> 16:54.196
...what a wonderful selection
of women's shoes.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.429
I think I'll take
this lovely wiener pair.

17:04.839 --> 17:08.469
They're so women's.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.829
Well, that's probably because
this is a woman's shoe store.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.394
How much do I owe you?

17:16.839 --> 17:20.150
Oh, you could never repay me.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.836
- Miss...?
- Bundy.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.508
Anyway, as a satisfied
woman customer...

17:31.760 --> 17:37.517
...in this, a women's shoe store,
I insist that I pay.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.914
Five, ten, fifteen.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.469
What are you doing?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.755
Waiting for my change.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.232
Get out.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.998
I guess I'll see you at home then.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.753
You bet.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.632
Now, do me a favour and leave
the oven on for Daddy, would you?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.637
Okay.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.598
- Mr. Bundy?
- One second, please.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.831
Let me say one thing.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.831
Please. Please, don't fire me.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.879
I'm just a major stroke away
from a comfortable retirement.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.874
Mr. Bundy, I have holdings
all over the world.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.157
I own airlines,
I own oil wells, I own men.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.794
Well, I'm for sale.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.838
- I said men.
- Sorry.

18:52.600 --> 18:57.799
Anyhow, I almost made
the Forbes 400 last year.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.396
I was number 401. You know why?

19:01.640 --> 19:05.474
You're too beautiful to be perceived
as a successful business woman?

19:06.160 --> 19:08.116
That's what I thought.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.434
But, no.
It's because of this shoe store.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.318
That was my second guess.

19:14.480 --> 19:19.349
This is the only holding I have that
has never ever made me any money.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.711
And I think I know why.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.760
Please, don't fire me!

19:26.280 --> 19:28.748
It's because of these shoes!

19:29.000 --> 19:32.390
Did you know that underneath...

19:34.200 --> 19:37.272
...this patina of jaw-breakers
and double-sided tape...

19:37.520 --> 19:40.114
...these are men's shoes?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.916
The hell, you say!

19:44.280 --> 19:48.432
- Oh, of course you knew.
- Oh, I did.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.511
I'll get my lunchbox.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.595
And obviously, you had the acumen
to know that men's shoes don't sell.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.589
Bundy, we're going to turn this store
into a moneymaker.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.475
- And you know how?
- Tear it down, put up a Gap?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.473
No.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.792
We're going to turn it
into a women's shoe store.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.553
A really cheap one.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.279
And we'll cater to their needs.

20:13.480 --> 20:17.632
There will be bidets
and Michael Bolton music...

20:19.240 --> 20:21.356
...and a place
where they can breast-feed.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.279
Congratulations, Mr. Bundy.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.557
You're going to sell women's shoes
for the rest of your life.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.435
You have such a wonderful store.

20:51.760 --> 20:55.150
I'm going to have to tell all the women
in my cheesecake club about it.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.070
Oh, Al, I'm so glad to see you
finally dragged your knuckles...

21:04.320 --> 21:06.629
...into the 20th century.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.068
What came over you?

21:09.080 --> 21:10.832
It certainly wasn't a clean T-shirt.

21:13.280 --> 21:16.272
That's right, Marcie, feed the bears.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.714
Excuse me, sir, but do you have
a place I can put this dirty diaper?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.829
No, I do not.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.914
And this is where I draw the line.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.152
There will be no dirty diapers
in my shoe store!

21:33.400 --> 21:35.197
Oh, no?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.155
Oh, no.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.796
Ladies, present loads.
