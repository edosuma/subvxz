Previously on <i>"Switched at Birth"...
What the hell are you doing?</i>

00:04.591 --> 00:06.125
Put the pin back in the
grenade, angry girl.

00:06.126 --> 00:07.659
I'm just answering your piece.

00:07.694 --> 00:11.396
The law say that I have to accommodate
you to the best of my ability,

00:11.431 --> 00:14.500
so if you want to stay,
go wash dishes.

00:14.534 --> 00:17.102
Judge: <i>Will you,
Regina Teresa Vasquez,</i>

00:17.136 --> 00:19.371
take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

00:19.405 --> 00:22.341
- I will.
- This marriage is strictly on paper.

00:22.375 --> 00:26.144
- What exactly are we looking for?
- Anything about the hospital

00:26.179 --> 00:28.080
or where Angelo might have gone.

00:30.116 --> 00:32.084
Maybe he went to see her.

00:32.118 --> 00:34.786
Colleen Vandernoot.
Does that ring any bells?

00:34.821 --> 00:36.239
I thought we could go
talk to her together

00:36.240 --> 00:37.656
and maybe it would jog your memories.

00:37.690 --> 00:38.808
No, seriously.

00:38.809 --> 00:40.125
I insist. I am not
going to let you freeze.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.729
- Oh.
- I am so sorry.

00:43.763 --> 00:45.831
They're going to be making sure
that we are living together.

00:45.865 --> 00:47.799
And if we are not,
we could go to jail.

00:47.834 --> 00:51.603
What if Angelo doesn't move
into the guest house,

00:51.638 --> 00:54.473
but he moves in here

00:54.507 --> 00:56.275
<i>with us?</i>

00:56.309 --> 00:58.477
( Spray paint hissing )

01:06.452 --> 01:09.087
<i>( people laughing )</i>

01:09.122 --> 01:11.256
Medusa: <i>I'm not even
listening to you, man.</i>

01:15.194 --> 01:17.763
See, there's some
yellow in here, yeah.

01:19.232 --> 01:22.968
- ( Soft chatter )
- Guy: <i>Man, just stick with paint, bro.</i>

01:23.002 --> 01:25.070
Medusa: <i>What are you
talking about, dude?</i>

01:25.104 --> 01:27.673
( Laughter, chatter )

01:32.946 --> 01:35.714
Hey, who the hell are you?

01:35.748 --> 01:37.816
Angry girl, you're back.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.319
Yeah, and as a bonus
I'm not even angry.

01:40.353 --> 01:41.653
Damn, what am I gonna call you then?

01:41.688 --> 01:43.439
Bay.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.190
I had her pegged as
more of a Courtney.

01:45.224 --> 01:48.160
( Chuckles ) Or a Brittany.

01:48.194 --> 01:49.494
- ( Laughs )
- Bay: <i>Well, it's Bay.</i>

01:49.529 --> 01:52.164
It's Bay Vasquez actually.

01:52.198 --> 01:53.398
Oh yeah?

01:53.433 --> 01:56.201
Yeah.
What's your name?

01:56.235 --> 01:57.803
Zarra.

01:57.837 --> 02:00.772
That's eight ball,
mouse and this is J.T.

02:02.041 --> 02:05.043
Do you think that I could
help you guys out?

02:05.078 --> 02:07.980
Like do a little tornado on
that streetlamp or something?

02:08.014 --> 02:09.799
Yeah, we actually don't mess
with toys out here, so...

02:09.800 --> 02:11.583
I'm not a toy.

02:15.388 --> 02:16.906
And we've already
worked together, so...

02:16.907 --> 02:18.423
You worked with her?

02:18.458 --> 02:20.626
Uh... huh.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.227
Look, I got this, okay?

02:25.431 --> 02:27.399
Look, this one's almost
all played out,

02:27.433 --> 02:30.068
but we're starting
something new this weekend.

02:30.103 --> 02:31.436
Maybe you could pitch in.

02:31.471 --> 02:34.272
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll text you a time and place.

02:35.341 --> 02:37.009
I'll be there.

02:38.344 --> 02:40.045
Sure you're up for this?

02:41.114 --> 02:43.849
- Absolutely.
- All right, gimme your number.

02:45.018 --> 02:46.184
We're gonna find out.

02:58.498 --> 02:59.665
Hey, I'm outta here.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.634
Who ordered these?

03:02.669 --> 03:05.303
I think they're for that
bridal party tomorrow.

03:05.338 --> 03:06.672
Dumbest trend ever.

03:06.706 --> 03:09.441
What's wrong with cupcakes?
They're delicious.

03:09.475 --> 03:11.610
They're for
five-year-olds.

03:15.381 --> 03:17.115
What?
I'm young at heart.

03:17.150 --> 03:19.151
You should put these
in the walk-in.

03:19.185 --> 03:21.253
- Am I allowed in there?
- Why not?

03:21.287 --> 03:23.021
Just don't get locked in.

03:23.056 --> 03:26.191
I'm kidding.
Actually no, I'm not.

03:37.003 --> 03:39.838
( Screams )

03:39.872 --> 03:41.773
- No no no no no!
- Daphne.

03:41.808 --> 03:44.676
- What happened?
- I'm sorry, Jeff.

03:44.711 --> 03:46.978
I... the shelf fell and I...

03:48.614 --> 03:50.682
aw, damn it.

03:51.784 --> 03:53.752
It's okay, it's not your fault.

03:53.786 --> 03:55.654
I knew I should have
fixed that shelf.

03:55.688 --> 03:57.422
Here, just throw those out.

03:59.358 --> 04:02.661
I might be able to fix them. I'm
pretty good with a frosting Piper.

04:02.695 --> 04:05.430
Then you better not have
any plans tonight.

04:08.201 --> 04:10.268
I don't have any plans.

Hey.

04:31.841 --> 04:33.291
Sorry. I thought you
worked out in the morning.

04:33.326 --> 04:36.161
Eh, sometimes I
work out in the morning,

04:36.195 --> 04:38.063
sometimes in the afternoons.

04:38.097 --> 04:40.365
That's the beauty
of having your own gym.

04:40.399 --> 04:43.268
- Yeah.
- Oh no no, please continue.

04:43.302 --> 04:45.504
- I was pretty much done.
- No, you got a great sweat going.

04:45.538 --> 04:48.306
- Just finish up.
- I'll be another 20 minutes?

04:48.341 --> 04:49.341
Fantastic.

04:52.578 --> 04:54.346
Just if you could remember to wipe

04:54.380 --> 04:56.181
everything down when you're done?

04:56.215 --> 04:58.150
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:05.258 --> 05:06.491
<i>( Door closes )</i>

05:53.339 --> 05:55.440
- ( Sighs )
- If you lift up at the end,

05:55.474 --> 05:57.442
it will give you more control.

05:57.476 --> 05:59.444
Great.

05:59.478 --> 06:01.346
I'm gonna have some more coffee.

06:04.116 --> 06:06.451
- Thank you.
- Did you ever think about doing pastry?

06:06.485 --> 06:10.121
- ( Snickers )
- What?

06:10.156 --> 06:12.224
Are you trying to get me
out of your kitchen again?

06:12.258 --> 06:15.260
No. I contract out desserts
because I'm no good at them.

06:15.294 --> 06:17.128
You clearly are.

06:17.163 --> 06:19.431
I want to be good at a lot of things.

06:19.465 --> 06:22.167
Desserts are just easy
because I'm a vegetarian, but...

06:22.201 --> 06:24.236
( chokes )

06:24.270 --> 06:26.171
That is worse than the deaf thing.

06:26.205 --> 06:28.073
Did you seriously just say that?

06:28.107 --> 06:30.508
Yeah, I seriously just did.
It's not cuisine.

06:30.543 --> 06:33.445
What, because there's no dead
animal it's not cuisine?

06:33.479 --> 06:36.114
We are meat eaters. We have
been meat eaters for millennia.

06:36.148 --> 06:38.283
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Yes, it does.

06:38.317 --> 06:42.187
It satisfies us. I've seen you
scarfing down those buttered rolls.

06:42.221 --> 06:44.456
You know why you love them so much?
Animal fat.

06:44.490 --> 06:47.092
Your poor starving body
is dying for it.

06:47.126 --> 06:49.527
- I'm not starved!
- But you're not satisfied.

06:49.562 --> 06:52.464
And whether or not you want
to save Bambi or whatever,

06:52.498 --> 06:55.333
we are in the business
of satisfaction,

06:55.368 --> 06:57.168
not evolution.

06:58.204 --> 07:00.038
Okay.

07:02.174 --> 07:03.475
It's your turn.

07:08.247 --> 07:10.315
Have you ever been to a chicken farm?

07:10.349 --> 07:13.084
Because I have and there's
nothing satisfying about it.

07:13.119 --> 07:15.854
- There's free-range...
- Free-range and all that...

07:15.888 --> 07:17.055
it's still death.

07:17.089 --> 07:20.025
And also, your point of view
is completely narrow-minded.

07:20.059 --> 07:21.860
You say you have to be this,
you can't be that.

07:21.894 --> 07:23.895
Is that what they teach you
at culinary school?

07:23.930 --> 07:26.531
Because if it is,
I'm not sure I want to go.

07:26.565 --> 07:28.733
You are fun on caffeine.

07:31.537 --> 07:34.572
You need some animal fat
for your coffee.

07:40.279 --> 07:43.081
And you can thank M.I.T.
For my narrow mind,

07:43.115 --> 07:44.449
not culinary school.

07:44.483 --> 07:47.185
- M.I.T.?
- Massachusetts...

07:47.219 --> 07:48.920
I know what
M.I.T. Means.

07:50.189 --> 07:52.891
That's why my tuna tartare is
so beautifully stacked.

07:52.925 --> 07:54.960
I had to use my engineering
degree for something.

07:57.096 --> 07:58.830
So what happened?

07:58.864 --> 08:00.865
Somebody told you to get a new dream?

08:00.900 --> 08:03.635
No, it never really was my dream.

08:04.937 --> 08:07.505
Also probably why I was so miserable.

08:07.540 --> 08:11.743
The only thing I ever truly
loved to do was cook, so...

08:12.812 --> 08:16.381
So you decided to do
what you really loved,

08:16.415 --> 08:18.550
even though nobody else
thought it was a good idea.

08:18.584 --> 08:21.486
Hmm, that is interesting.

08:25.091 --> 08:26.958
You have a little...

08:36.135 --> 08:39.070
<i>( guitar notes playing )</i>

08:44.677 --> 08:46.228
I don't want to interrupt
their meeting in there.

08:46.229 --> 08:47.579
It looks important.

08:47.613 --> 08:49.914
Ah, it's just their lawyer.
Endless lawsuit.

08:50.950 --> 08:53.485
Croissant?
They gave me an extra one.

08:53.519 --> 08:55.653
Oh no, I'm good.

08:55.688 --> 08:58.423
So how are you holding up
at <i>casa de</i> Kennish?

08:58.457 --> 09:00.592
It's, um...

09:00.626 --> 09:04.162
it's nice of your parents
to open their home to me.

09:08.334 --> 09:10.001
So...

09:10.036 --> 09:11.336
Have you ever played with a band?

09:13.105 --> 09:16.975
Yeah, but my bass player got
shipped off to boarding school

09:17.009 --> 09:19.177
and my drummer had sex
with my girlfriend,

09:19.211 --> 09:21.046
so I'm kinda nowhere right now.

09:23.115 --> 09:25.683
I know what you mean.

09:25.718 --> 09:27.752
So we're going to trial

09:27.787 --> 09:29.854
with one lactation consultant

09:29.889 --> 09:31.956
whose favorite topic
is the antichrist?

09:31.991 --> 09:33.758
Most of the time she gives

09:33.793 --> 09:36.528
a very convincing portrait
of the hospital's negligence.

09:36.562 --> 09:38.763
I was hoping we'd have
more after six months.

09:38.798 --> 09:41.433
What about Angelo's source
at the hospital?

09:41.467 --> 09:43.435
- We asked him, what? Twice?
- Twice.

09:43.469 --> 09:45.603
Each time he said he got
an anonymous phone call

09:45.638 --> 09:48.239
tipping him off
to a disgruntled nurse.

09:48.274 --> 09:51.376
What about the fact that the girls
were actually switched at birth?

09:51.410 --> 09:52.795
<i>( Phone ringing )</i>

09:52.796 --> 09:54.179
<i>I mean doesn't that
count for something?</i>

09:54.213 --> 09:56.281
Oh, I should grab this.
Excuse me.

09:56.315 --> 09:58.116
- Honey...
- Hello.

10:06.892 --> 10:09.994
So did you hear that
I'm going to be interviewed

10:10.029 --> 10:11.963
on "good afternoon Kansas City"?

10:11.997 --> 10:14.699
- No no, that's great.
- Yeah, about my book.

10:14.733 --> 10:16.734
( Stammering ) Marcia grace...

10:16.769 --> 10:19.604
she's going to interview
me and Regina.

10:19.638 --> 10:22.507
Um, but they want to do it
in front of the hospital.

10:22.541 --> 10:24.843
- Do you think that's okay?
- I don't see why not.

10:24.877 --> 10:27.412
Obviously steer clear of the lawsuit

10:27.446 --> 10:30.482
and don't let them talk you into
saying anything that you'll regret.

10:30.516 --> 10:33.251
Oh, I'm sure I'll be fine.

10:33.285 --> 10:35.220
- I know you will be.
- Yeah.

10:40.392 --> 10:43.962
So you're actually driving
out to see crazy Colleen?

10:43.996 --> 10:45.396
- Yep.
- ( Both laugh )

10:45.431 --> 10:47.232
Well, I don't miss that.

10:49.268 --> 10:50.969
Oh, I didn't...

10:51.003 --> 10:52.170
I didn't mean...

10:52.204 --> 10:54.105
no no, it...

10:54.140 --> 10:56.908
<i>( footsteps ) Ahem.</i>

10:58.911 --> 11:02.514
That was the Dean at Buckner hall.
Craig, you'll have to excuse us.

11:02.548 --> 11:04.199
What is it, honey?

11:04.200 --> 11:05.850
We need to have a
chat with our daughter.

11:05.885 --> 11:08.620
Academic probation?
That's impossible.

11:08.654 --> 11:10.455
It's only been like three weeks.

11:10.489 --> 11:11.723
The Dean was impressed as well.

11:11.757 --> 11:13.725
- He thinks you set a new record.
- What can I say?

11:13.759 --> 11:15.527
Grandma Bonnie was right.
I'm latina.

11:15.561 --> 11:17.295
I'm at a severe genetic disadvantage.

11:17.329 --> 11:18.413
Bay.

11:18.414 --> 11:20.097
This has nothing to do with
your racist grandmother.

11:20.132 --> 11:21.399
- She's not racist.
- Oh, honey, please.

11:21.433 --> 11:24.069
Sweetie, you have not turned in
your labs from the Galapagos,

11:24.103 --> 11:25.537
not to mention a weeks'
worth of math homework

11:25.571 --> 11:28.006
and I believe there's a paper
due in your French class?

11:28.040 --> 11:30.441
That paper is not due
until like Monday.

11:30.476 --> 11:32.177
Oh.

11:32.211 --> 11:34.245
Honey, you really
have to buckle down.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.114
Colleges look at these grades.

11:36.148 --> 11:37.949
But I'm gonna go to art school.

11:37.983 --> 11:39.884
And they don't care
about stuff like that.

11:39.919 --> 11:41.853
They just care about
the work that I submit.

11:41.887 --> 11:44.222
Bay, I know you're
into painting and all that,

11:44.256 --> 11:47.692
and that's wonderful, but you
have to keep your options open.

11:47.726 --> 11:49.928
Okay? Until you finish
these assignments

11:49.962 --> 11:52.730
- you are not leaving the house.
- You're locking me up?

11:52.765 --> 11:55.934
That... what if I have errands
that I need to run or something?

11:55.968 --> 11:59.437
- No homework, no leave.
- <i>That is so unfair, dad!</i>

11:59.471 --> 12:02.574
Hi, um, I just needed
to pass through.

12:02.608 --> 12:05.643
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- You're not interrupting anything.

12:05.678 --> 12:07.679
<i>They</i> are putting me
under house arrest

12:07.713 --> 12:10.582
- because I'm a little late on homework.
- She has science labs,

12:10.616 --> 12:13.351
math homework and a French
paper all due very soon.

12:13.385 --> 12:15.453
We're just trying to help her
structure her time.

12:15.487 --> 12:16.955
I could help with the
French, if you'd like.

12:16.956 --> 12:18.423
That's okay.

12:18.457 --> 12:21.392
- We've got this covered.
- I would love your help.

12:21.427 --> 12:23.995
After all, what are dads for, right?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.320
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:42.351 --> 12:44.690
- Is chef here?
- He's out back.

12:44.709 --> 12:47.611
So I heard you got stuck here
all night with the beastmaster.

12:47.646 --> 12:49.613
It was awful.

12:49.648 --> 12:52.716
This shelf just poof! And
then... ( Mimics explosions )

12:52.751 --> 12:54.785
There was shrimp everywhere.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.455
- All I heard was how you saved the day.
- Really?

12:57.489 --> 13:00.357
Yeah, you and your mad
frosting skills.

13:00.392 --> 13:01.759
Did you know that
he went to M.I.T.?

13:01.793 --> 13:04.728
Oh, Vivienne, <i>ma belle.</i>

13:04.763 --> 13:08.499
- ( Speaks French )
- Last strawberries of the year

13:08.533 --> 13:10.401
and they're the best.
Here, try.

13:11.603 --> 13:13.370
- Mmm, that's good.
- Right?

13:13.405 --> 13:15.339
With a little balsamic
or fresh cream.

13:15.373 --> 13:18.242
- Scuba: <i>Mmm, yeah.</i>
<i>- Hi, chef!</i>

13:18.276 --> 13:20.211
- Are you on the schedule?
- No.

13:20.245 --> 13:22.980
Well, I am later. I just
came by to pick up my check

13:23.014 --> 13:25.382
and I made you some
cauliflower gratin?

13:25.417 --> 13:29.053
- Some what?
- Cauliflower... gratin.

13:29.087 --> 13:32.123
Oh, <i>gratin.</i>
<i>Sorry, I didn't understand.</i>

13:32.157 --> 13:34.892
- Vivienne, hi!
- <i>Hi.</i>

13:34.926 --> 13:37.094
- Chef: <i>Wow, those look great.</i>
<i>- Have a strawberry.</i>

13:37.129 --> 13:38.162
Oh.

13:39.831 --> 13:40.931
- Mmm.
- Good, right?

13:40.966 --> 13:42.833
- It's fantastic.
- <i>Have some more.</i>

13:42.868 --> 13:44.568
Thank you.

13:44.603 --> 13:45.870
- <i>Yes please.</i>
<i>- ( Vivienne laughs )</i>

13:45.904 --> 13:47.771
Bay: <i>So it's all
about relationships.</i>

13:47.806 --> 13:50.608
Yep, trig is just about

13:50.642 --> 13:52.743
sides and ratios.
And if you get stuck,

13:52.777 --> 13:55.646
- just remember...
- Both: Soh-cah-toa.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.382
Sine equals opposite over hypotenuse.

13:58.416 --> 14:00.518
Cosine equals adjacent
over hypotenuse.

14:00.552 --> 14:02.520
Tangent equals...

14:02.554 --> 14:05.222
Opposite over...

14:05.257 --> 14:07.091
over... over...

14:07.125 --> 14:08.959
Adjacent adjacent adjacent!

14:08.994 --> 14:10.294
Yes, all right, sweet!

14:10.328 --> 14:13.130
Oh, in your face,
Mr. Winslow!

14:13.165 --> 14:14.999
- ( Laughs )
- All right, so seriously,

14:15.033 --> 14:17.868
if you need help
with, like, an art project

14:17.903 --> 14:20.037
or, I don't know,

14:20.071 --> 14:22.072
someone to taste
a chocolate souffle...

14:22.107 --> 14:23.941
um, actually

14:23.975 --> 14:26.877
you have this one shirt...

14:26.912 --> 14:28.946
oh cool.
Okay.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.682
It's black and kind
of see-through?

14:31.716 --> 14:32.850
Uh...

14:34.786 --> 14:37.388
Yeah, this one.

14:37.422 --> 14:39.490
- Do you mind?
- Go for it.

14:39.524 --> 14:41.659
It's a little high octane
for me these days anyway.

14:43.528 --> 14:45.363
Do you usually wear, like, a...
with it?

14:45.364 --> 14:47.198
A camisole.

14:48.433 --> 14:51.168
Uh, here you go.

14:51.203 --> 14:53.370
So are we wrapping up
the goods for Wilke or...

14:53.405 --> 14:57.841
well, we both decided not to
do the long-distance thing.

14:57.876 --> 14:59.143
There's actually

14:59.177 --> 15:02.179
this new guy.
He's a little bit older.

15:02.214 --> 15:04.782
Uh, more.
Immediately, please.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.884
( Laughs ) I don't want to jinx it.

15:06.918 --> 15:11.622
And I'm not actually sure that I'm
not making the whole thing up.

15:11.656 --> 15:13.557
( Both laugh )

15:13.592 --> 15:15.492
Well, ha!

15:15.527 --> 15:19.597
We have found some
real common ground here.

15:19.631 --> 15:21.432
You're gonna help me with trig,

15:21.466 --> 15:23.567
and I'm gonna help you with your

15:23.602 --> 15:26.270
borderline slutty
re-branding.

15:28.406 --> 15:31.342
Hey, I'm on my way to the
TV interview with Kathryn.

15:31.376 --> 15:33.444
I'll... wow.

15:33.478 --> 15:35.446
You look... fancy.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.115
- Thanks. So do you.
- Thanks.

15:38.149 --> 15:40.918
So did you make the reservation
for me and melody?

15:40.952 --> 15:44.188
8:00. If you come early, I'll try
to bring you into the kitchen.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.058
You're going to wear
a sweater with that, right?

15:48.093 --> 15:51.695
- No, I'm good.
- I don't think you are.

15:51.730 --> 15:53.964
Do you tell Bay to put on a
sweater when she wears this?

15:53.999 --> 15:56.533
- Bay's never worn that.
- It's her shirt, mom.

15:56.568 --> 15:58.869
Well, I mean, Bay...

15:58.903 --> 16:01.605
What? Bay can
pull it off and I can't?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.741
Look, sweetie, there are many ways

16:03.775 --> 16:06.410
to get noticed, so if you're
trying to catch someone's eye...

16:06.444 --> 16:08.679
oh my God, mom,
this is not about some boy.

16:08.713 --> 16:10.681
Can't I just want
to look nice for myself?

16:10.715 --> 16:12.650
Of course.

16:14.552 --> 16:17.321
I'll see you there.
Good luck with the interview.

16:17.355 --> 16:19.089
Thanks.

16:19.124 --> 16:22.092
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

16:24.129 --> 16:26.930
And to think the last time we were
both here at the same time...

16:26.965 --> 16:28.065
Yeah.

16:28.099 --> 16:32.102
Regina, thank you so much
for doing this for me.

16:32.137 --> 16:35.906
You're putting Angelo up, the least
I could do is be your P.R. Lackey.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.075
Hi, I'm marcia.

16:38.109 --> 16:40.844
- It's such a pleasure to meet you both.
- Such an honor.

16:40.879 --> 16:42.079
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:42.113 --> 16:45.582
Oh okay.
We're just about to start.

16:45.617 --> 16:47.818
- If you're ready? Great, have a seat.
- Yes.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.620
Okay.

16:54.626 --> 16:57.861
We're here with two women who have
lived every mother's nightmare.

16:57.896 --> 17:00.731
16 years ago, their daughters
were switched at birth

17:00.765 --> 17:02.633
in this very hospital.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.636
We have with us today Kathryn
Kennish, author of the new memoir

17:05.670 --> 17:07.637
"the true story
of a mother's journey"

17:07.672 --> 17:11.141
and Regina Vasquez.
Ladies,

17:11.175 --> 17:12.476
tell me about that first time

17:12.510 --> 17:14.444
you laid eyes
on your biological daughter.

17:14.479 --> 17:17.314
Oh, the first time I saw Daphne
my heart just stopped.

17:17.348 --> 17:20.317
Me, I was just overwhelmed.

17:20.352 --> 17:23.020
It's just not something
I ever expected.

17:23.054 --> 17:26.089
But, Regina, from what I understand
you and your daughter's father

17:26.124 --> 17:29.660
had doubts shortly after you came home
from the hospital. Is that right?

17:29.694 --> 17:31.729
Well, she did have
a different coloring.

17:31.763 --> 17:33.564
We always thought
that Bay was special.

17:33.598 --> 17:35.933
Though you wrote you never suspected
anything, isn't that right?

17:35.967 --> 17:38.802
- Well, not that she wasn't ours.
- Oh, of course.

17:38.837 --> 17:41.538
And you must have had a lot of
nannies, given your resources,

17:41.573 --> 17:45.509
so you may not have picked up on some
of the subtle cues the way Regina did.

17:45.543 --> 17:48.612
I'm sure I speak for a lot
of mothers who are wondering

17:48.646 --> 17:52.549
how you possibly did it... a single
mother struggling to make ends meet,

17:52.584 --> 17:57.154
battling alcoholism,
raising a deaf daughter.

17:57.188 --> 17:59.022
I just did what I had to do.

17:59.057 --> 18:00.958
I took it one day at a time.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.160
Well, you are a true hero.

18:03.194 --> 18:07.164
Tell us how you found the time to
become fluent in sign language.

18:07.198 --> 18:11.068
I woke up an hour and a half
before Daphne did and I practiced.

18:11.102 --> 18:14.538
- I've been learning A.S.L.
- She's getting really good.

18:14.572 --> 18:16.640
- Thank you.
- I bet.

18:16.674 --> 18:18.475
So you left your home,

18:18.510 --> 18:20.711
your friends, your entire life behind

18:20.745 --> 18:23.580
to move in with the Kennishes
for the sake of your daughters.

18:23.615 --> 18:26.350
How have you been
handling that adjustment?

18:26.384 --> 18:29.319
<i>I just did what any</i>
<i>devoted mother would do.</i>

18:29.354 --> 18:33.123
<i>I'm not gonna lie, it has been difficult
giving up some of my autonomy.</i>

18:33.158 --> 18:36.226
I'm sure it has. Tell me
about the culture shock.

18:45.118 --> 18:47.853
(Sighs) That was actually kinda fun.

18:47.888 --> 18:51.023
That marcia grace seems
a lot nicer on TV.

18:51.057 --> 18:54.727
Oh, she wasn't that bad. Anyway,
hopefully we sold a lot of books.

18:54.761 --> 18:56.629
Yeah.

18:56.663 --> 18:58.964
You should come out with me and
melody tonight to celebrate.

18:58.999 --> 19:01.634
- We're going to Daphne's restaurant.
- I don't know.

19:01.668 --> 19:03.002
It'll be fun.

19:03.036 --> 19:06.572
Plus with my wrist, I'm gonna need
somebody to help me interpret.

19:06.606 --> 19:09.742
Think of it as your way of paying
me back for doing the interview.

19:09.776 --> 19:11.644
I thought the interview was your way

19:11.678 --> 19:13.879
of paying <i>me</i> back
for Angelo moving in.

19:13.914 --> 19:15.748
Oh jeez, just come.

19:19.819 --> 19:23.355
It's three parts olive oil,
one part vinegar,

19:23.390 --> 19:25.758
some lemon juice...

19:25.792 --> 19:28.394
Whoa, nice shirt.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.563
You going to a stripper's funeral?

19:30.597 --> 19:32.665
- What?
- Yeah okay,

19:32.699 --> 19:35.568
apparently my humor
doesn't survive lip reading.

19:35.602 --> 19:38.137
- I'm sorry.
- ( Laughs )

19:38.171 --> 19:40.272
- Hi, chef.
- Hey. Scuba,

19:40.307 --> 19:42.308
these pear tarts
came out kind of flat.

19:42.342 --> 19:44.276
See what you can do with them...
add a ganache,

19:44.311 --> 19:46.979
creme anglaise, I really don't
care, just make 'em good.

19:47.013 --> 19:50.082
You know what? Actually use her and do
it fast before I need some dishes, okay?

19:50.116 --> 19:52.017
You got it, chef.

19:54.054 --> 19:55.854
- Are you going somewhere?
- No.

19:55.889 --> 19:57.056
I... just here.

19:57.090 --> 19:59.792
I... I meant after.
'Cause you look...

19:59.826 --> 20:02.061
oh. I have some family
coming in tonight,

20:02.095 --> 20:04.897
but I can definitely stay late.
I mean, if you need me to.

20:05.899 --> 20:07.866
Okay.

20:09.603 --> 20:11.737
<i>( French dialogue on TV )</i>

20:13.840 --> 20:16.575
Mr. Feldman is gonna love me
doing the French new wave.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.677
This is so much cooler
than the French revolution.

20:18.712 --> 20:21.680
But these movies were completely
revolutionary for the time.

20:21.715 --> 20:24.416
Truffaut and godard
grabbed their camera

20:24.451 --> 20:27.486
and made the streets their studio.
It's totally alive.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.055
I know exactly what you mean.

20:34.127 --> 20:36.128
I thought you were
supposed to be studying.

20:36.162 --> 20:38.831
I am. This is
my French project.

20:38.865 --> 20:41.066
Dad, why don't you join us?
It's a really good movie.

20:41.101 --> 20:43.102
I can fill you in
on what you have missed.

20:43.136 --> 20:45.704
No no, that's okay.
I think I'll take advantage

20:45.739 --> 20:47.740
of the empty gym and grab a workout.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.591
I hope I'm not crashing your party.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.526
Of course not!
I'm happy you could come.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.195
It's gorgeous.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.068
Almost. Once they start
letting me cook,

21:16.102 --> 21:19.004
then I'll be living my dream.

21:19.039 --> 21:21.106
Right now Daphne is washing dishes,

21:21.141 --> 21:23.876
but not for long, right?

21:25.211 --> 21:27.079
- Chef.
- Are these your guests?

21:27.113 --> 21:30.749
I hope it's okay. I was
just showing them around.

21:30.784 --> 21:33.652
Of course.
Have we met?

21:33.687 --> 21:35.054
- Actually...
- This is Kathryn, my mom.

21:35.088 --> 21:37.823
And Regina, my mom.
And melody.

21:37.857 --> 21:39.792
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

21:39.826 --> 21:41.660
Jeffrey Reycraft.
Welcome to maize.

21:45.598 --> 21:48.701
"Chef Jeff"?
Really, chef Jeff?

21:48.735 --> 21:51.637
( Chuckles ) I bet you get
that all the time, I'm sorry.

21:51.671 --> 21:54.139
I'll show them to their table.

21:54.174 --> 21:56.241
No, I will.
Besides we need

21:56.276 --> 21:58.344
Daphne in the kitchen.

21:58.378 --> 22:00.412
She's our secret weapon.

22:00.447 --> 22:03.048
If you ladies will follow me?

22:04.250 --> 22:06.185
<i>You have to try the tasting menu.</i>

22:06.219 --> 22:09.121
I'll bring out each
individual course.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.935
Other than that, <i>tres bien.</i>

22:22.969 --> 22:25.637
Huh. Well, I don't want
to jinx anything,

22:25.672 --> 22:27.873
but I think this French paper
might actually be good.

22:27.907 --> 22:30.476
- ( Phone vibrating )
- Yeah.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.383
Uh, Angelo, can I ask you a favor?

22:37.417 --> 22:39.351
I would be more than happy
to proofread.

22:39.386 --> 22:41.220
Oh no, it's not that.
It's just...

22:41.254 --> 22:44.490
I'm supposed to meet somebody

22:44.524 --> 22:48.026
and as you know, I'm still
under Kennish house arrest.

22:48.061 --> 22:50.963
Do you mind covering for me?

22:50.997 --> 22:52.448
Where do you need to go?

22:52.449 --> 22:53.899
Oh, it's not dangerous
or anything like that.

22:53.933 --> 22:57.002
I promise. It's just my parents
are not cool like you are.

22:57.036 --> 23:00.839
- They wouldn't understand.
- Bay, I don't think it's a good idea.

23:02.909 --> 23:05.677
You're my dad too.

23:05.712 --> 23:07.613
You should have a say in what I do.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.349
And I won't be more than an hour.

23:10.383 --> 23:11.583
Please?

23:14.521 --> 23:17.423
- Hi.
- So, uh,

23:17.457 --> 23:19.325
Angelo thought it would
be a good idea for

23:19.326 --> 23:21.193
me to continue studying
at a French cafe.

23:21.227 --> 23:22.594
You know, the whole immersion thing.

23:22.629 --> 23:24.463
A cafe?

23:24.497 --> 23:27.232
Doesn't sound like a very
conducive work environment.

23:27.267 --> 23:30.068
C'mon, I just want a croissant
and a little change of scenery.

23:30.103 --> 23:32.070
Plus look at all the work
I've done, okay?

23:32.105 --> 23:33.806
I have trigonometry,

23:33.840 --> 23:35.207
all my labs from the galapagos,

23:35.241 --> 23:38.911
<i>and</i> an English paper that's
not even due till Wednesday.

23:38.945 --> 23:41.713
Isn't it amazing what you can do
when you put your mind to it?

23:41.748 --> 23:42.882
Thank you.

23:42.883 --> 23:44.216
That's why I've been
so hard on you, Bay.

23:44.250 --> 23:47.753
I think your art is fantastic, but
if you really apply yourself,

23:47.787 --> 23:50.556
you could be somebody.

23:50.590 --> 23:51.790
Yeah.

23:51.825 --> 23:55.394
So you think
the cafe thing will help?

23:55.428 --> 23:58.597
Never doubt the power
of <i>le croissant</i> to inspire.

23:58.631 --> 24:02.167
Okay,
curfew's at 10:30.

24:02.202 --> 24:04.236
All right, then as the French say...

24:05.572 --> 24:08.474
however the French say,
"let's go," we're gonna do that.

24:08.508 --> 24:11.210
- <i>Allez-y.</i>
<i>- Allez-y.</i>

24:26.511 --> 24:29.280
"And then there was this
guy who brought his pug

24:29.314 --> 24:32.316
in a bag with him
everywhere he went."

24:32.350 --> 24:36.887
You should introduce him to the
guy with the boa constrictor.

24:36.922 --> 24:38.956
To start things off,
we have an amuse bouche.

24:38.990 --> 24:40.891
My twist on the classic
chiles rellenos.

24:40.926 --> 24:43.160
Tempura Chile, crab,
corn and scallions.

24:43.195 --> 24:45.629
Amuse bouche?

24:45.664 --> 24:48.966
It's an appetizer to an appetizer.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.737
It's French for "amusement
for the mouth."

24:58.777 --> 25:00.076
I don't, um...

25:00.101 --> 25:02.236
- She loves scallions.
- Oh.

25:02.270 --> 25:04.104
Enjoy.

25:07.042 --> 25:09.844
Mmm mmm!

25:09.878 --> 25:11.912
Anyone else want
another glass of wine?

25:11.947 --> 25:13.747
I think we've had enough.

25:13.782 --> 25:16.984
Are you afraid if I drink too much, I
might finally become more interesting?

25:17.018 --> 25:19.153
Or, I don't know, more heroic?

25:19.187 --> 25:22.756
( Sighs ) Kathryn, marcia
grace only found me heroic

25:22.791 --> 25:24.692
because of what you wrote.

25:24.726 --> 25:26.627
Look, they look great.

25:28.970 --> 25:31.905
Okay fine, maybe I didn't have
to uproot my entire family,

25:31.940 --> 25:33.458
but that doesn't mean
it hasn't been hard

25:33.459 --> 25:34.975
having everybody move into our house.

25:35.010 --> 25:38.879
Especially Angelo. You think that
marcia grace might have mentioned that.

25:38.913 --> 25:41.882
Excuse me, could I have
another Pinot noir?

25:41.916 --> 25:43.684
- <i>Thank you.</i>

- Okay.
- So you're gonna do a solo piece,

No yards, no tunnels.

26:21.122 --> 26:23.123
Fine, what kind of piece?

26:24.159 --> 26:26.060
It doesn't matter.

26:28.229 --> 26:30.798
As long as it's got risk, y'know?

26:32.033 --> 26:34.902
Look, the people out there, they
don't want to see us, right?

26:34.936 --> 26:37.905
So you gotta find someplace
where they gotta see you,

26:37.939 --> 26:39.807
where they gotta know you.

26:40.875 --> 26:42.709
And then I can work with you guys?

27:14.275 --> 27:16.243
Maple or something?

27:21.182 --> 27:25.219
Daphne, I need some help
prepping for tomorrow's brunch.

27:25.253 --> 27:27.855
- You're all right to stay?
- Absolutely.

27:27.889 --> 27:29.823
- Tonight?
- Unless you have other plans.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.091
Nope, I'm good.

27:31.126 --> 27:33.660
Good.

27:35.763 --> 27:37.865
<i>( Acoustic guitar playing )</i>

27:46.741 --> 27:48.742
- Hey, Toby.
- Oh hey, what's up, man?

27:48.776 --> 27:52.546
- Have you seen Bay?
- No, I thought she was with you.

27:52.580 --> 27:54.381
Didn't you guys go
to a cafe or something?

27:54.415 --> 27:56.350
We... we did, but, uh...

27:58.286 --> 28:01.488
Oh!
You're her new cover.

28:01.523 --> 28:03.090
It used to be me.

28:03.124 --> 28:05.259
- So you haven't heard from her?
- No, I'm sorry.

28:05.293 --> 28:08.061
She was supposed to come to the
cafe after she met somebody,

28:08.096 --> 28:11.165
but she never showed up, she
hasn't answered my texts.

28:11.199 --> 28:14.001
Is it a boy? Is she
into drugs or anything?

28:14.035 --> 28:16.803
No, it's nothing like that.

28:16.838 --> 28:20.040
But wait, if you were worried about
that, why did you let her go?

28:20.074 --> 28:22.743
- ( Door closes )
- Hey, guys.

28:23.945 --> 28:25.612
Where's Bay?

28:28.483 --> 28:29.483
I don't know.

28:29.517 --> 28:31.652
What do you mean you don't know?

28:31.686 --> 28:34.555
Well, um, this is
a good opportunity...

28:34.589 --> 28:36.690
I don't follow. What do you mean
you don't know where Bay is?

28:36.724 --> 28:39.359
It seemed like you were blaming her
because I moved in so I wanted to do

28:39.394 --> 28:41.562
- something nice for her.
- What the hell are you talking about?

28:41.596 --> 28:44.431
- She had someplace she wanted to go.
- What do you mean someplace...

28:44.465 --> 28:45.983
A friend texted her and
she wanted to meet up...

28:45.984 --> 28:47.100
What friend texted?

28:47.135 --> 28:49.369
- I didn't see any harm.
- You saw no harm in this?

28:49.404 --> 28:51.238
What are you talking about?

28:51.272 --> 28:54.141
You let her go off to God knows
where with God knows whom?

28:54.175 --> 28:56.843
- She promised she'd be back in an hour.
- Let me explain something.

28:56.878 --> 28:58.946
You are not her friend, okay?
You're her father!

29:05.753 --> 29:08.689
You're her father.

29:09.991 --> 29:12.759
And that means that you have
to say "no" to her sometimes.

29:14.862 --> 29:17.664
She will not like you for it,

29:17.699 --> 29:19.733
but it doesn't matter

29:19.767 --> 29:22.603
'cause your job is not
to make her <i>like</i> you.

29:22.637 --> 29:25.405
Your job is to <i>protect</i> her.

29:28.343 --> 29:30.377
You're right.

29:30.411 --> 29:33.113
So what do we do now?

29:33.147 --> 29:34.314
We go out, we look for her?

29:34.349 --> 29:37.284
- Where?
- I don't know, John.

29:39.921 --> 29:42.155
No, you know what we do right now?

29:43.291 --> 29:45.993
We sit, we worry,

29:46.027 --> 29:48.061
we wait.

- Are you kidding me?
- So I've got a fancy dashboard system.

30:20.061 --> 30:22.730
I hope it's not too much
of a culture shock.

30:22.764 --> 30:25.799
Okay, you really need to
let go of that interview.

30:25.834 --> 30:29.703
All those years of just
being Mrs. John Kennish

30:29.738 --> 30:32.940
and I thought finally people actually
cared about what I had to say.

30:32.974 --> 30:35.743
But no! They just want
to hear your story.

30:35.777 --> 30:39.546
What about all the good reviews
for the book <i>you</i> wrote?

30:39.581 --> 30:41.448
You know what I don't get?

30:41.483 --> 30:45.719
You kept my daughter
away from me for 13 years,

30:45.754 --> 30:48.355
and somehow I'm the bad guy?

30:48.390 --> 30:52.426
- 'Cause I am so rich and out of touch.
- You are not the bad guy.

30:52.460 --> 30:55.029
How did I not know?

30:55.063 --> 30:59.233
When they put Bay in my hands
instead of Daphne,

30:59.267 --> 31:01.969
how did I not know?

31:02.003 --> 31:04.872
You can't blame yourself

31:04.906 --> 31:07.174
or marcia grace or me.

31:09.844 --> 31:12.713
This thing has to have
a navigation system, right?

31:12.747 --> 31:15.916
- I know the way home.
- We're not going home.

31:15.950 --> 31:18.585
We're gonna go exorcise some demons.

31:26.661 --> 31:31.265
Oh wow, I was not expecting
you both to still be up.

31:31.299 --> 31:34.301
- Thank God you're okay.
- I'm sorry.

31:34.335 --> 31:36.204
I had really terrible
reception, I didn't get

31:36.205 --> 31:38.072
any of your texts
until, like, just now.

31:39.207 --> 31:42.009
That's all you have to say?

31:42.043 --> 31:43.911
I'm sorry.
I really am.

31:45.947 --> 31:49.783
Why do you think we've all
turned our lives upside down?

31:51.820 --> 31:53.854
So that this man could
be a part of your life.

31:56.658 --> 31:58.625
I know.

31:58.660 --> 32:01.528
And yet you treated him
like a convenient alibi.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.433
He deserves more than that.

32:08.336 --> 32:10.437
I'm going to bed.

32:19.380 --> 32:22.282
I really messed up. I shouldn't
have asked you to lie for me.

32:22.317 --> 32:25.219
And I shouldn't have done it.

32:28.790 --> 32:30.090
I should go to bed.

32:47.876 --> 32:51.778
Do you remember them being so tiny?

32:51.813 --> 32:55.649
I remember being convinced that
I was going to drop Daphne.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.685
Oh, I used to have nightmares

32:58.720 --> 33:01.321
about leaving Bay
in the dirty laundry.

33:01.356 --> 33:04.291
Oh, and one time
on the top of the car. Ugh.

33:04.325 --> 33:08.362
They do all sort of look alike.

33:11.432 --> 33:13.167
They do.

Don't they?

33:17.172 --> 33:19.106
Well...

I can take right now.

Oh, just taking a walk
down memory Lane.

Aw, okay.
Have a good night.

33:32.587 --> 33:33.887
Okay.

34:04.252 --> 34:07.087
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

It's salmon...

34:10.358 --> 34:12.326
oh God, please don't
tell me fish too?

34:12.360 --> 34:15.996
No, I eat fish. It looks amazing.
Thank you.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.900
And thank you for being
so sweet to my moms.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.703
- They were blown away.
- Of course.

34:22.737 --> 34:24.871
It was nice to meet them.
They're a cute couple.

34:24.906 --> 34:27.808
Oh, they're not together.

34:28.976 --> 34:30.744
It's just a long story.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.413
Come on, I told you about
my engineering degree.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.482
Yeah, some other time.

34:38.418 --> 34:40.554
Mmm, so

see how it goes.

34:45.560 --> 34:49.062
Wait, I'm sorry, I just want
to make sure I got that.

- That's what I thought you said.

34:56.103 --> 34:58.171
So you mean no more washing dishes?

34:58.206 --> 35:00.774
As long as you stop trying
to turn me vegetarian.

35:00.808 --> 35:03.110
Yes!
Oh my God, thank you!

35:03.144 --> 35:06.179

shouldn't have done... I...

35:06.214 --> 35:08.815
but I'm so excited.
Thank you so much!

there, you mind grabbing it for me?

35:13.855 --> 35:15.656
Of course.

A bottle of what?

35:17.492 --> 35:20.360
Chateaun... never mind.

all good with glasses.

35:58.099 --> 36:00.200
Yeah no, I was just...

38:33.827 --> 38:36.362
No, I definitely want
to take a look at it.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.743
No, don't call the police
until I see it.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.414
I'll be there in 20.
Yeah.

38:41.448 --> 38:43.483
- <i>( Phone beeps )</i>
<i>- Police?</i>

38:43.517 --> 38:47.220
Yeah, good morning. Apparently there was
an incident at the car wash last night.

38:47.254 --> 38:49.956
- I have to head in.
- Huh.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.892
I finished my French
project last night

38:52.927 --> 38:55.862
if you wanted to take a look at it.

38:55.896 --> 38:57.931
I would be happy to take
a look at it when I get back.

38:57.965 --> 39:01.067
Dad, why don't I just go with you?

39:01.101 --> 39:03.636
I can show you my project
at the car wash.

39:03.671 --> 39:05.571
Okay.
Get dressed.

39:14.615 --> 39:16.616
- Ahh.
- Blueberry muffins?

39:16.650 --> 39:17.718
From Chuck's?

39:17.719 --> 39:20.085
It's the only place in the neighborhood
that is open at 7:00.

39:20.119 --> 39:21.654
You're not eating with the Kennishes?

39:21.689 --> 39:23.007
Nah.

39:23.008 --> 39:24.324
Yeah, they're pretty
cheery in the morning.

39:24.358 --> 39:27.160
It's not that. I just
feel like I'm in the way.

39:27.194 --> 39:30.363
And when I'm not, I'm
messing things up with Bay.

39:30.397 --> 39:33.032
Run-ins with the Kennishes,

39:33.067 --> 39:34.467
making mistakes with your daughter...

39:34.501 --> 39:36.336
welcome to my world.

39:36.370 --> 39:38.237
Come on.

39:38.272 --> 39:41.074
You shouldn't have to have
breakfast alone every morning.

40:05.065 --> 40:07.800
Good evening, ladies. Which
baby are we visiting tonight?

40:07.835 --> 40:10.536
Regina: Just taking a
trip down memory Lane.

40:10.571 --> 40:12.372
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, have a good night.</i>

40:16.610 --> 40:19.645
Craig, it's Kathryn. I'm sorry
to bother you on a Sunday,

40:19.680 --> 40:22.615
but I think I might have figured out

40:22.649 --> 40:25.385
who Angelo's source
at the hospital is.

40:25.419 --> 40:27.487
Call me when you can.

40:32.426 --> 40:34.594
John: Huh.

40:36.597 --> 40:40.333
Wow, will you look at that?

40:42.136 --> 40:43.403
It's, uh, cool, right?

40:43.437 --> 40:46.439
You know it's bad enough they
trash their own neighborhoods,

40:46.473 --> 40:48.941
now they come down here
and pull this crap?

40:48.976 --> 40:50.109
<i>And guess who gets to clean up?</i>

40:50.144 --> 40:53.112
Me. Eh, it's good
that you're here.

40:53.147 --> 40:55.815
I got paint and rollers in the back.

40:55.849 --> 40:59.185
You can tell me all about your
French project while we work.
