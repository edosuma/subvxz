WEBVTT

00:03.959 --> 00:05.375
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:05.458 --> 00:07.250
There's a giant pocket of primorphous gel.

00:07.333 --> 00:11.250
It's the key to Harper's master plan
to destroy the world.

00:11.333 --> 00:12.500
I know where the ooze is.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.083
It's under the school!

00:14.166 --> 00:17.542
(Harper) What would happen
if I could control the monsters

00:17.625 --> 00:18.542
with my mind?

00:18.625 --> 00:20.709
Fighter jets? We're fighting the military?

00:20.792 --> 00:23.166
They didn't need to be convinced
you were an enemy of the state

00:23.250 --> 00:25.375
after you... destroyed the school.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.458
(Ryan) They made it look
like we're the villains.

00:27.542 --> 00:31.333
(Harper) But hey, don't worry.
I will keep your mom safe.

00:31.417 --> 00:34.166
I'm gonna Harper sorry
he ever messed with my family.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.083
(birds chirping)

00:39.083 --> 00:40.709
(whooshing)

00:43.583 --> 00:45.041
Dang.

00:46.917 --> 00:49.709
-(grunts)
-Bro, are you all right?

00:49.792 --> 00:51.709
Aah. I can't shake these guys.

00:51.792 --> 00:54.500
I believe the "let's run away"
plan isn't working!

00:56.417 --> 00:58.083
We need a new tactic.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.375
Oh, okay! How about this,
how about this plan?

01:00.458 --> 01:02.750
I get in an escape pod and eject.

01:03.417 --> 01:04.458
And?

01:05.125 --> 01:06.834
-And... And what?
-(missile whooshes)

01:06.917 --> 01:09.917
(grunting)

01:12.667 --> 01:14.083
There goes the last of our shields.

01:14.166 --> 01:17.083
Harris, I think it's time
to try out our special project.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.834
It isn't ready yet. I haven't tested it!

01:18.917 --> 01:19.917
Do it!

01:28.583 --> 01:30.458
(jet engine roaring)

01:30.542 --> 01:32.917
(Man over radio)
Fox Four to Bay Command.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.375
The robot has disappeared.

01:34.458 --> 01:37.375
I repeat, the robot has disappeared.

01:37.458 --> 01:39.959
(theme music playing)

01:58.959 --> 02:00.208
(jet engines roaring)

02:04.291 --> 02:05.375
(Harris) What's up now?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.291
Didn't expect the robot
to hologram up, did you?

02:08.375 --> 02:09.750
So you best ghost.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.583
Since when could we do that?

02:15.667 --> 02:17.792
I asked Harris to install
a hologram generator

02:17.875 --> 02:19.458
like the one hiding Mech-X3.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.417
Consider this our first field test.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.834
I'd say it passed.

02:23.583 --> 02:26.125
Always wondered
what passing a test felt like.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.583
Leo deserves most of the credit.
He invented it.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.959
-Speaking of Leo...
-I sent him our GPS coordinates.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.000
He's on his way from Mech-X3
to help with repairs.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.917
Good, okay. I'm out of here.

02:36.709 --> 02:38.417
I'm heading to Harper's to save Mom.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.041
(Harris) Right now?

02:40.125 --> 02:42.250
Because that worked out
so well the last time.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.875
We almost lost the robot.

02:43.959 --> 02:46.375
I don't need the robot to save Mom!

02:46.458 --> 02:48.375
Okay? I have a power.

02:49.875 --> 02:50.917
Out of my way.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.875
Dude, move or I will move you.

02:54.959 --> 02:56.417
You're not going.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.917
You're the only one
that can pilot this robot.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Ry, Mark is right.
If the military finds us,

03:01.083 --> 03:03.458
the robot will have to make
another run for it.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.375
You can't leave!

03:06.375 --> 03:08.834
I'll take the tech and get Mom.

03:08.917 --> 03:09.917
And I'm going, too.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.583
I know that place like the back
of my perfectly moisturized hand.

03:13.667 --> 03:14.500
You?

03:15.625 --> 03:17.959
I kind of saw this
as a solo Mark Walker thing.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.709
-Uh, no offense.
-Some taken.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.709
Dude, just-- You need him.

03:22.792 --> 03:25.041
He's been working there
every day after school

03:25.125 --> 03:26.375
since he won the Harper grant.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.458
He knows the layout.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.333
Hey, Mark?

03:34.709 --> 03:36.166
Bring her home.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.458
Come on. Let's go check the damage report.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.959
-Uh-oh.
-(alarm beeping)

03:50.041 --> 03:51.667
Yeah, that's not good.

03:52.709 --> 03:53.917
Go, go, go.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.542
Hey-hey, what are you doin', Grace-Face?

04:03.625 --> 04:06.375
Sorry, I'm experimenting
with new pet names.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.417
I... I'm going to find my boys.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.834
-No, no, no, wait!
-Seth,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.000
if there's a point,
can you get there faster?

04:12.083 --> 04:14.125
I'll make it quick.
I'm behind the monsters.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.542
Yeah. And I'm about to make a new one
from the gel under the school.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.917
It's gonna be the biggest,
most destructive beast I've ever created.

04:21.000 --> 04:21.875
(whispering) Wow!

04:21.959 --> 04:24.166
You are... insane.

04:25.041 --> 04:27.083
I am getting out of here
and away from you.

04:30.542 --> 04:31.834
(grunts)

04:31.917 --> 04:33.875
-What? No, no!
-Okay, Morris, Morris, Morris!

04:33.959 --> 04:36.667
Gently, Morris, please.

04:36.750 --> 04:40.458
Listen, Grace, I am sorry about all this,
but we can talk about everything

04:40.542 --> 04:43.458
once I, you know... reboot the world.

04:45.208 --> 04:46.917
No. No, no, no...

04:47.000 --> 04:48.250
(groans)

04:49.333 --> 04:50.333
What was that?

04:50.417 --> 04:53.166
Insurance. Just finished it.

04:53.250 --> 04:57.000
Yeah. I can't enjoy the apocalypse
without my best gal there.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.959
Get her down to the bunker level.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.500
Aha. Ah.

05:08.792 --> 05:11.792
So, um,
one of the military's missiles hit,

05:11.875 --> 05:14.792
pierced the hole heh, but didn't explode.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.583
Aw, that's so sad.
Didn't fulfill its destiny.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.709
Hey! Let's keep it that way.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.583
Woo! Oh! Wow.

05:25.834 --> 05:29.750
Why would I design an elevator
that gives me the dizzies?

05:29.834 --> 05:32.834
(chuckles) Okay. So what's the emergency?

05:32.917 --> 05:36.083
Wow! Man, did I come to the wrong party.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.667
Okay, maybe I can defuse it.

05:38.750 --> 05:39.917
Stop!

05:40.000 --> 05:42.417
I mean, indoor voice. Stop.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.792
It looks too damaged.
You might just set it off.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.083
It could detonate and destroy
the robot at any second.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.500
So, what do we do?

05:49.583 --> 05:52.917
Hmm. The hologram was gettin'
real glitchy when I flew in.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.333
I need to stabilize it or--

05:54.417 --> 05:56.208
Before we're sitting ducks
for the military.

05:56.291 --> 06:01.417
Yes. You guys need to get it out
of the wall... and get it outside.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.125
And then I can use my power
and detonate it from a distance.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.083
Yes, yes.

06:06.875 --> 06:07.875
Good luck with that.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.375
Hear that, buddy?
You get to be you after all!

06:13.458 --> 06:14.667
It's a missile!

06:23.542 --> 06:24.750
(detector beeps)

06:26.291 --> 06:27.625
(detector beeps)

06:28.542 --> 06:29.542
(detector beeps)

06:32.917 --> 06:35.625
-(Harris sneezes)
-Watch it, dude.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.333
Sorry. But you smell like
body spray and low test scores.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.917
(sniffing)

06:41.000 --> 06:43.417
You're the one that said
we had to do this so close.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.125
So can you be more careful?

06:45.208 --> 06:48.834
We can do it in separate stealth fields,
but... we won't be able to see each other.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.709
Won't be much of a covert op
if I have to yell "Mark!"

06:55.125 --> 06:57.834
See, this is why I-- Never mind.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.291
What? This is why you didn't want me
to come along?

07:00.375 --> 07:02.709
Look, you're great, right, in the lab,

07:02.792 --> 07:04.750
but out in the field, not so much.

07:04.834 --> 07:07.250
And I can't protect you and save my mom
at the same time.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.542
Wait.

07:08.625 --> 07:10.709
So I'm some kind of professional
damsel in distress?

07:11.792 --> 07:13.792
Yeah, but a dude version.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.208
That doesn't make it any better. Come on.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.291
(truck horn blowing)

07:22.458 --> 07:24.583
And... voila!

07:24.667 --> 07:27.333
The ultimate in anti-robot tech.

07:28.917 --> 07:33.166
Oh. Appreciate the help, Mr. Harper,
but we have weapons.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.000
So why do we need yours?

07:35.083 --> 07:38.500
Well, you kind of blew your chance
to destroy the robot

07:38.583 --> 07:42.083
when it attacked my building,
and now you kind of lost the robot.

07:42.166 --> 07:45.375
So, let's be honest.
You need all the help you can get.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.250
What are these parts from, the 1950s?

07:49.333 --> 07:52.125
What is that casing, plastic?

07:52.208 --> 07:53.750
Really gives it that vintage vibe.

07:53.834 --> 07:58.041
I mean, who says a weapon of mass
destruction can't be a little stylish.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.750
But, yeah, it's almost totally analog,
barely any electronics.

08:00.834 --> 08:04.166
Trust me, you wanna go
low-tech with this robot.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.542
Thanks, civilian,

08:05.625 --> 08:09.041
but my "HarpPhone"
only works half the time,

08:09.125 --> 08:11.542
so I'll stick with the weapons
that I know work.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.166
-Soldier?
-Zing, sir.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.458
Okay, good talk. You know what?

08:17.542 --> 08:19.792
I'm gonna leave it here, just in case.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.041
(mutters) I'm sure you dimwits
will need it later.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.709
Careful. Careful!

08:31.500 --> 08:34.208
Easy. Easy. Easy!

08:36.041 --> 08:40.083
Oh, man, Tuesday confession: I cheated
on my bar mitzvah, I'm not a real man yet.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.542
-Okay.
-We're good. Yeah, we're good.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.250
We are so not good!

08:44.333 --> 08:46.500
Okay, hey, take it easy.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.500
You know, you, kind of, have been,
um, barking orders at everyone.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.041
My therapist would call that acting out.

08:52.125 --> 08:55.291
I'm scared, Spyder.
Harper has outmaneuvered us at every turn.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.709
The ooze, my mom, the military,
and we could fail, you know?

08:58.792 --> 09:00.125
That doesn't even freak you out?

09:00.208 --> 09:01.208
No.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.667
Not even a little?

09:02.750 --> 09:06.000
No, 'cause I know my best friend
has these powers,

09:06.083 --> 09:08.583
so I'm totally not scared
of some rich old dude.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.792
That's the point. What if my powers
and the robot aren't enough to save Mom

09:11.875 --> 09:12.709
and the city?

09:12.792 --> 09:15.583
I know you, Ryan. How many bones
did you almost break

09:15.667 --> 09:17.875
trying to master
the McCallister 720 backwards?

09:17.959 --> 09:20.333
(chuckles) All of 'em.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.583
That's what I'm saying.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.583
That attitude with these powers
equals victory!

09:23.667 --> 09:24.917
-(grunts)
-Oh, boy.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.583
(alarm beeping)

09:26.667 --> 09:28.291
It's gonna explode! Door!

09:34.041 --> 09:35.000
Come on!

09:36.417 --> 09:37.625
(grunting)

09:48.667 --> 09:50.041
(Leo) Ryan, Spyder, you guys okay?

09:50.125 --> 09:51.500
-Yeah, we're good.
-I peed.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.041
The explosion took out the power.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.417
No power means no hologram cover.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.375
Major!

10:00.458 --> 10:01.583
What've we got?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.166
Fox Three has reacquired the target.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.792
Excellent. Tell him to clear the airspace.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.750
We're gonna hit him
with everything we've got.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.750
(Mark) Okay, dude, we need
to find my mom quickly.

10:11.834 --> 10:14.291
You're sure Harper's
penthouse elevator is this way?

10:14.375 --> 10:17.750
Yes. Look, about this whole
"needing to be rescued" thing.

10:17.834 --> 10:20.333
-Will you let it go?
-No. I'm a scientist.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.834
Scientists need evidence
to make a conclusion.

10:22.917 --> 10:26.041
You don't have any to back up the idea
that I need to be rescued.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.291
Or I'm not good in the field.

10:27.375 --> 10:30.041
I pulled you out of a shack
during the Octoconda attack.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.500
I helped cure you when you were turning
into an ooze monster.

10:32.583 --> 10:34.667
-Isolated incidents.
-Okay, true or false?

10:34.750 --> 10:37.250
You once zapped yourself unconscious
in the middle of a fight?

10:37.333 --> 10:38.834
I have no recollection of that.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.542
I'm just saying, right?
You're a brain.

10:40.625 --> 10:44.166
Leave the physical stuff to me,
stick with what you know.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.333
Not cool!

10:45.417 --> 10:47.667
Oh! You little...

10:47.750 --> 10:49.083
Uh...

10:50.500 --> 10:53.417
Uh... Nothing.
Power's out all over the 'bot.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.500
The core must be damaged.
This could take me a while to fix.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.583
The military could attack any second.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.458
Well, you're the technopath, Ryan.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.750
I need you to hold 'em off
until I get the power back on.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.041
Whoa, whoa. Are you serious?

11:04.125 --> 11:06.750
You just want me to hold off
the entire military?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.834
But you fight monsters.

11:08.917 --> 11:12.250
Yeah, in a robot! But now it's just me.

11:12.333 --> 11:16.166
And your power. Uh... It's gonna have
to be enough for now, I'm afraid.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.125
Leo, come on, you're dreaming, okay?

11:18.208 --> 11:21.417
I couldn't destroy the ooze,
I couldn't rescue my mom,

11:21.500 --> 11:22.834
and now this?

11:24.583 --> 11:27.959
Just face it, okay?
The wrong person got the power.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.542
It should've been someone else,
someone better.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.625
I wish I had something more inspirational
to say right now, Ryan,

11:35.709 --> 11:39.583
but you're the technopath,
so, it has to be you.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.500
If it makes any difference,
I believe in you.

11:43.583 --> 11:44.792
Hey, that's what I said!

11:44.875 --> 11:46.291
Although he said it better.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.166
We both know you can do it, Ry.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.375
All right, fine. But just please hurry
and get the power back on.

11:59.458 --> 12:00.625
Yeah.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.917
Sir, all the missiles
are locked onto the robot.

12:18.792 --> 12:20.208
(Major) Fire at will!

12:29.959 --> 12:30.792
All right.

12:31.875 --> 12:32.709
I got this.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.959
Who's got this? I got this.

12:40.792 --> 12:41.875
(missiles roaring)

12:41.959 --> 12:43.834
Uh-oh.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.083
(grunting)

12:49.166 --> 12:50.959
(grunts)

12:52.750 --> 12:53.834
(grunts)

12:57.917 --> 12:59.333
Okay, yeah. See? There.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.375
Those globes are supposed to be connected.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.417
We gotta get the broken ends realigned.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
Okay, well, have you met
my friend duct tape?

13:06.417 --> 13:09.375
Okay, yes. I love your enthusiasm.
Thank you very much.

13:09.458 --> 13:13.875
But... I have no idea what that energy
discharge is gonna do to a human being.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.041
(grunting)

13:19.458 --> 13:20.792
(shouts)

13:22.041 --> 13:23.625
Ryan's in danger. We gotta fix it.

13:23.709 --> 13:25.291
He could be getting killed out there.

13:25.375 --> 13:29.834
I know. Um, here, I can. Yeah,
just, uh... go get my radiation suit.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.792
Hurry! Don't look back.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.041
Keep running!

13:33.125 --> 13:34.792
I've got to realign them myself.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.000
-Hey, what are you doing?
-There's no time.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.834
-Hey!
-Sorry.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.625
Leo!

13:55.667 --> 13:56.750
(screams)

14:00.500 --> 14:02.834
Every single missile destroyed
before they hit the target!

14:02.917 --> 14:04.583
Yes, sir, all negative impacts.

14:07.792 --> 14:09.625
Find someone who can fire that missile.

14:09.709 --> 14:11.667
-Let's destroy that robot.
-Yes, sir!

14:14.709 --> 14:15.875
(beeping)

14:15.959 --> 14:20.333
Ooh, looks like someone finally decided
to use my missile.

14:27.709 --> 14:29.000
Ooh.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.375
Leo, this one's different!

14:38.458 --> 14:40.208
My powers aren't working on it!

14:40.709 --> 14:41.875
(chuckling)

14:44.583 --> 14:46.208
I can't stop this one!

14:46.917 --> 14:49.041
Goodbye, Ryan.

14:51.333 --> 14:54.667
Leo, this one's different!
I can't stop it!

15:02.166 --> 15:03.834
(alarm sounding)

15:07.625 --> 15:08.959
(growls)

15:12.375 --> 15:13.583
Yeah!

15:13.667 --> 15:15.375
(laughs) Wooo!

15:15.458 --> 15:16.500
Yeah!

15:19.417 --> 15:21.792
Okay. I'll just sit down.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.792
(chuckles)

15:25.875 --> 15:27.500
Ryan, you better get down here.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.709
-Leo!
-(coughs)

15:33.792 --> 15:35.750
What were you thinking?

15:35.834 --> 15:39.166
I had to. Because the world
needs you, Ryan.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.208
You're the only one who can stop Harper.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.875
Look, I know sometimes
you wish someone else

15:44.959 --> 15:47.125
got the power so you could
just be a normal kid,

15:47.208 --> 15:49.625
but... I'm glad it was you.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.083
You're a good kid.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.750
With a good heart.

15:56.917 --> 15:58.959
The right person got the power.

16:01.959 --> 16:03.917
(coughing)

16:04.000 --> 16:04.917
Let him sleep.

16:06.542 --> 16:07.667
It took guts, what he did.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.125
He almost died.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.792
I'm not gonna let that be for nothing.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.500
We have to finish what he started.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.333
So we're gonna win this thing?

16:17.417 --> 16:19.291
Without a doubt. But I need my team.

16:24.166 --> 16:27.709
I cannot believe this.
Now we have to be rescued from our rescue.

16:27.792 --> 16:30.333
Whoa. This place is huge.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.083
Check it.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.583
Is that a missile?

16:37.667 --> 16:39.458
What's that thing on it?

16:39.542 --> 16:42.417
It looks just like a monster heart,
but a thousand times bigger.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.375
Wait. Does that mean he can make
a monster a thousand times bigger?

16:45.458 --> 16:47.583
If it gets to the ooze
under the school, yeah.

17:04.959 --> 17:06.875
Hey, Dingus. Where's my mom?

17:06.959 --> 17:10.291
-If you've hurt her, I sw--
-Shut it! Your mom's not goin' anywhere.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.083
And neither are you.

17:14.458 --> 17:15.875
(whispering) I need a distraction.

17:15.959 --> 17:17.375
What? Why?

17:17.458 --> 17:19.792
-It just needs to be for a sec.
-I said shut it.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.667
-(guards grunting)
-Duck!

17:24.750 --> 17:26.667
What? Ow!

17:27.792 --> 17:29.375
(grunting)

17:32.750 --> 17:34.625
Get 'em! Now!

17:36.125 --> 17:37.917
(grunting)

17:40.417 --> 17:42.375
Harris, we're totally outnumbered!

17:42.458 --> 17:43.709
I know. I have an idea!

17:52.375 --> 17:53.208
Wait, wait, no!

17:56.709 --> 17:58.792
It's time for brains to meet brawn.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.875
Man, forget what I said!

18:00.959 --> 18:02.166
You got nothin' to prove!

18:02.250 --> 18:03.458
Don't drink that stuff!

18:03.542 --> 18:05.375
This is the only way to save your mom.

18:05.458 --> 18:06.875
No!

18:10.458 --> 18:13.583
You're right about one thing.
I am gonna need to be rescued.

18:15.542 --> 18:19.250
If we get out of here, I'm gonna need you
to get me some of that antidote, ASAP!

18:19.333 --> 18:20.667
(Morris) Come on, get this open!

18:20.750 --> 18:21.834
(groans)

18:27.875 --> 18:29.458
(voice distorted) Wait for it.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.542
(screaming)

18:34.625 --> 18:35.875
Huh?

18:37.208 --> 18:39.375
-(growling)
-(groans)

18:42.959 --> 18:44.291
Got the gear!

18:44.375 --> 18:46.166
(grunts)

18:47.959 --> 18:49.583
(zapping)

18:51.542 --> 18:52.417
(screams)

18:53.959 --> 18:55.125
(groans)

18:58.917 --> 19:00.792
Harris? You all right?

19:02.041 --> 19:04.417
(growling)

19:04.500 --> 19:06.417
Whoa!

19:06.500 --> 19:07.834
(groans)

19:13.917 --> 19:15.750
Brains and brawn.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.083
Not bad, buddy.

19:18.417 --> 19:19.625
Let's get out of here.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.750
Lieutenant!

19:21.834 --> 19:23.875
What is the status on that robot?

19:23.959 --> 19:25.625
Uh, sir...

19:26.792 --> 19:29.500
The robot may be the least
of our problems now.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.667
There's a new monster coming
from Harper Futuristics.

19:34.959 --> 19:37.000
-(screaming)
-(alarm sounding)

19:41.000 --> 19:43.333
(roaring)

19:48.417 --> 19:49.625
Mom safe?

19:50.417 --> 19:51.959
Yeah. In the med bay.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.875
But you can kiss our secret identities
goodbye when she wakes up.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.000
Is that ooze antidote?

19:58.083 --> 20:00.041
Leftover from the capsule for the school.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.542
-Long story.
-Not, it's not. He's crazy.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.792
But maybe not the worst guy
to go into a fight with.

20:07.875 --> 20:11.250
Guys... Harper built
a giant monster heart.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.542
We have to destroy it
before he gets it to the school.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.583
We will, but right after
we end this new monster.

20:15.667 --> 20:17.750
It's threatening
innocent people right now.

20:17.834 --> 20:20.041
Then we'll kick Harper's butt
from here to the Moon.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.208
-Sound good?
-Yeah!

20:24.750 --> 20:26.375
Mech-execute!

20:26.458 --> 20:29.083
(alarm sounding)

20:30.667 --> 20:34.041
-(roaring)
-(screaming)

20:37.291 --> 20:38.125
Fire!

20:39.709 --> 20:40.875
(growling)

20:49.291 --> 20:50.875
You okay?

20:52.792 --> 20:53.834
Oh!

20:56.875 --> 20:58.125
(howling)

21:00.000 --> 21:02.375
I may have been wrong about that robot.

21:02.458 --> 21:03.959
Let's take this thing apart!

21:18.417 --> 21:19.291
(grunts)

21:22.458 --> 21:24.709
(grunting)

21:29.917 --> 21:31.500
Ow!

21:35.041 --> 21:36.375
(groans)

21:40.542 --> 21:42.709
It just... stopped?

21:42.792 --> 21:45.709
(Harper) You're only gonna take me
by surprise once, Ryan.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.208
-Did that monster just talk?
-Can't be.

21:58.959 --> 22:00.750
Hello, guys!

22:00.834 --> 22:02.542
And goodbye.

22:05.542 --> 22:08.000
(theme music playing)

22:28.875 --> 22:30.291
(barks)
