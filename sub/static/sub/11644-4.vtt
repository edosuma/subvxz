WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.679
What the fuck is going on?

00:04.680 --> 00:07.519
Since when did you run around
jumping off buildings?

00:07.520 --> 00:09.559
Since I travelled back
from the future.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.159
So what happens now?

00:11.160 --> 00:13.039
You fall in love with me.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.159
Am I going to die?

00:14.160 --> 00:15.759
I'm not going to let that happen.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.079
You can never tell Simon I'm him.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.039
Is this doing anything for you?

00:20.040 --> 00:21.879
I'm a guy, we're not that fussy.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.799
I just think we should be mates.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.119
You OK?

00:25.120 --> 00:27.079
Brilliant.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.439
Can I do anything, like?

00:28.440 --> 00:29.879
You got a spare heart?

00:29.880 --> 00:33.879
What?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:58.600 --> 01:02.599
What you doing?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.119
Nothing.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.279
Well, if you're done
being all superheroey,

01:09.280 --> 01:13.279
with your little clocks,
you can come back to bed.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.839
# War, huh, yeah

01:36.840 --> 01:39.159
# What is it good for?

01:39.160 --> 01:42.479
# Absolutely nothing
Uh-huh, oh

01:42.480 --> 01:46.119
# War, huh, yeah

01:46.120 --> 01:47.799
# What is it good for?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.559
# Absolutely nothing

01:49.560 --> 01:51.199
# Say it again, y'all

01:51.200 --> 01:55.199
# War, huh, huh,look out... #

02:06.120 --> 02:09.119
Hey.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.199
Who's the new guy?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.919
What's your name again?

02:13.920 --> 02:15.439
It's Ollie.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.159
Right. These are
some other young offenders.

02:19.160 --> 02:23.159
He's going to be doing his Community
Service thing with you lot.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.879
Are you saying he's like
a new member of the gang?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.919
Whatever.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.919
Look, piss off
and pick up some litter.

02:37.080 --> 02:41.079
Hi.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.519
# The city breathing

02:56.520 --> 02:58.199
# The people churning

02:58.200 --> 02:59.679
# The conversating

02:59.680 --> 03:03.679
# The price is what?

03:16.800 --> 03:17.999
# The conversating

03:18.000 --> 03:19.879
# This place is heaven

03:19.880 --> 03:21.679
# And if you see them... #

03:21.680 --> 03:24.719
Whatever happens, we can't let the
new guy find out about our powers.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.359
What do we do if he does find out?

03:26.360 --> 03:29.119
We kill him.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.639
I'm joking.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.519
You're making jokes now? 
Excuse us.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.039
You're creeping out of
your weird little shell.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.039
I get that. Good for you.
But let's get one thing straight,
I'm the funny guy round here.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.919
He's coming.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.599
All right?

03:48.600 --> 03:51.079
What did you get done for?

03:51.080 --> 03:55.039
I was arrested for vandalising
a coal-fired power station.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.759
We were protesting
against CO2 emissions.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.759
DISINTERESTED GROAN

04:08.640 --> 04:11.639
Have any of you got
one of these weird powers?

04:11.640 --> 04:12.879
What? What powers?

04:12.880 --> 04:15.159
I was only asking
because I've got one.

04:15.160 --> 04:18.159
Oh, yeah, us too.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.319
I don't think I was supposed
to tell you that.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.359
What can you do?

04:23.360 --> 04:25.879
I can teleport.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.879
Let's see you do it then.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.239
Whoa!

04:47.240 --> 04:50.599
Ahem. 

04:50.600 --> 04:53.399
That's shit.
You could've walked there quicker.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.399
Sometimes I go further than that.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.399
That's really impressive.

04:57.400 --> 05:01.399
I honestly thought something more
exciting was going to happen.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.199
This is great.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.879
So are we all right?

05:20.880 --> 05:23.279
You know,
what with me slipping you a finger?

05:23.280 --> 05:27.279
I don't even want to
think about it, all right?

05:29.520 --> 05:33.519
Does all this get recycled?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.719
What's with this guy?

05:35.720 --> 05:39.719
He's fucking crazy!

05:43.160 --> 05:47.159
Oh. Do you think he was
talking about this fella?

06:00.640 --> 06:02.439
Where's Conti?

06:02.440 --> 06:04.239
Oh, it's him.

06:04.240 --> 06:08.239
He's a right Conti.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.719
Did you think I was going to let
it go? I want my money.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.199
Give the man his money.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.199
I haven't got your money.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.079
Roxy?

06:34.240 --> 06:37.559
So you're with him now?

06:37.560 --> 06:40.999
I was still waiting for you at the
church when the cops picked me up.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.519
Not being funny, mate, but
you're acting like a right nutter.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.959
He's clearly suffering from
a mental illness.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.039
I want my money.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.679
Let me talk to him.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.239
Don't, look, just leave it.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.439
It's OK.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.319
I've had some training
in conflict resolution.

06:56.320 --> 07:00.319
This should be entertaining.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.879
What's your name?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.479
It's OK.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.479
I'm not going to hurt you...

07:12.200 --> 07:17.559
Run!
Run!

07:17.560 --> 07:18.319
Run!
Oh, fuck's sake!

07:18.320 --> 07:22.319
Fuck!

08:00.280 --> 08:02.759
He shot him. He shot the new guy.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.479
We should go back for him.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.839
He was hit in the head.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.599
He's fucked.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.599
Hey, no. It's OK.
He's fine. He's over there.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.919
I don't see him.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.479
What?

08:19.480 --> 08:23.479
Oh, then that must be his ghost,
which means he's not at all OK,

08:24.680 --> 08:27.239
on account of him being dead.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.799
This is messed up.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.279
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, new guy!

08:31.280 --> 08:34.679
Sorry you got shot, man.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.958
Hey, fuck you!

08:35.960 --> 08:36.999
What was that?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.318
He just got shot
and you're insulting him?

08:39.320 --> 08:40.759
He made an obscene gesture.

08:40.760 --> 08:44.719
I don't care if he's dead.
There's no excuse for rudeness.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.239
You should rewind time.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.399
You can save him.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.399
Go on, then.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.359
Well, I didn't know him.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.959
I'm not feeling it.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.479
Yeah, he was a bit of a twat.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.319
There's something wrong with you.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.119
Come on, seriously?
He was never going to fit in,

09:12.120 --> 09:16.119
what with all the caring
about the environment and
that. Better him than me.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.199
You're immortal.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.199
Better him, than one of you.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.999
# Think of your fellow man
Lend them a helping hand

09:31.480 --> 09:35.479
# Put a little love in your heart

09:36.240 --> 09:40.239
# You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate

09:41.640 --> 09:45.559
# To put a little love
into your heart

09:45.560 --> 09:49.559
# And the world, the world,
would be a better place

09:50.680 --> 09:54.679
# Oh, and the world, the world,
would be a better place

09:55.680 --> 09:58.799
# For you

09:58.800 --> 10:01.359
# And just for me, and me

10:01.360 --> 10:03.599
# You just wait, just wait

10:03.600 --> 10:07.319
#And see

10:07.320 --> 10:11.319
# Another day goes by
Still the children cry

10:12.560 --> 10:16.559
# Put a little love into your heart

10:17.240 --> 10:21.239
# If you want the world to know... #

10:26.520 --> 10:29.039
You knew?

10:29.040 --> 10:31.679
You knew it was going to happen?

10:31.680 --> 10:34.319
Why didn't you stop it?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.399
I can't save everyone.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.519
That's bullshit.

10:39.520 --> 10:43.279
If I'd have stopped
it from happening,

10:43.280 --> 10:47.279
someone else would've died.

11:02.110 --> 11:05.549
The police want witness
statements off all of you.

11:05.550 --> 11:08.469
And try not to screw it up cos
I don't need them on my back.

11:08.470 --> 11:12.389
Think you can manage that?

11:12.390 --> 11:14.189
Good.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.189
Is that it?

11:15.190 --> 11:18.029
Aren't you going to even
pretend to be a little bit sad?

11:18.030 --> 11:19.749
Do you know how much

11:19.750 --> 11:23.749
paperwork's involved when someone
gets shot doing community service?

11:24.070 --> 11:27.269
I've got health and safety
forms coming out of my arse.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.349
So sure,

11:29.350 --> 11:33.349
we're all very sad! So there it is.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.989
It's a cruel, senseless waste.

11:38.950 --> 11:40.509
A young man...

11:40.510 --> 11:44.469
taken from us in his prime,
leaving us to pick up the pieces

11:44.470 --> 11:46.189
of our shattered lives,

11:46.190 --> 11:50.149
knowing that he's gone forever.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.709
So, maybe

11:51.710 --> 11:54.189
we should have the
rest of the week off,

11:54.190 --> 11:58.189
you know, to cry and grieve,
and remember our dear friend...

12:06.150 --> 12:10.909
Ollie.
Ollie! Dear, beautiful Ollie.

12:13.150 --> 12:16.509
Heartless bastard.

12:16.510 --> 12:20.509
We should do something...

12:21.270 --> 12:23.669
..about the guy who shot Ollie.

12:23.670 --> 12:27.669
So, you're talking about stepping
up to the plate and taking him down?

12:28.470 --> 12:30.429
I really don't see that happening.

12:30.430 --> 12:30.949
He's right.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.429
He's right.
Since when did you want to get
involved in anything like this?

12:33.430 --> 12:37.269
Maybe since I got someone's
brains blown out all over my face.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.589
If we go up against him,

12:38.590 --> 12:40.589
one of us is going to get our
brains blown out.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.429
We can't just pretend
it didn't happen.

12:42.430 --> 12:44.549
I do that all the time.

12:44.550 --> 12:47.709
It's like that fella in the Bible -
the Good Samaritan.

12:47.710 --> 12:50.269
Walk on by.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.549
So, how are you going to feel if

12:52.550 --> 12:56.549
we do nothing and we read in the
paper that he shot someone else?

12:57.070 --> 12:59.389
I don't read the papers.

12:59.390 --> 13:01.029
All right.
So what're you two going to

13:01.030 --> 13:05.029
do when you find this guy and
he sticks a gun to your head?

13:05.710 --> 13:09.709
I'm glad you've got it all figured
out. No way you're getting involved.

13:10.110 --> 13:12.629
Since when did you tell
me what I can and can't do?

13:12.630 --> 13:16.189
Since I care about whether you die
or not. You forgotten about that?

13:16.190 --> 13:17.909
Guys. Come on. Seriously.

13:17.910 --> 13:21.869
I think I speak for all of us when
I say we're lazy and incompetent.

13:21.870 --> 13:24.109
We're practically handicapped.

13:24.110 --> 13:27.549
Leave it to the police.
They get paid to get shot.

13:27.550 --> 13:31.029
I never thought I'd say this but
he's talking sense.

13:31.030 --> 13:35.029
Thank you. Hey! I'm already
doing my bit to fight crime. Bosh!

13:46.950 --> 13:49.869
It feels weird

13:49.870 --> 13:52.509
that's someone else's heart...

13:52.510 --> 13:56.509
It will feel strange
for a little while.

13:57.430 --> 14:01.429
You're making the most
remarkable recovery.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.469
How does it work? Am I supposed to

14:06.470 --> 14:09.949
send a card to his parents?
"Thanks for the heart."

14:09.950 --> 14:12.189
Would you like me to see if the
next of kin are happy

14:12.190 --> 14:16.189
for their details to be passed
on to you?

14:17.310 --> 14:21.309
Yeah... OK.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.789
BEEPING

14:40.790 --> 14:44.789
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

15:18.230 --> 15:22.149
I can't even go back and save
someone who's just been shot.

15:22.150 --> 15:26.149
What's that about?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.949
Am I boring you?

15:29.950 --> 15:31.549
I'm just checking the time.

15:31.550 --> 15:34.469
Because you're bored?
No. Because I'm having
the time of my life!

15:34.470 --> 15:37.109
What's going on with you?
Nothing.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.349
It seems like there is.

15:38.350 --> 15:39.949
Just leave it, all right?

15:39.950 --> 15:43.469
Get down!

15:43.470 --> 15:44.789
Did he see us?

15:44.790 --> 15:48.789
I don't think so.

15:50.070 --> 15:51.309
Shit! What's he doing?

15:51.310 --> 15:54.709
I don't know.

15:54.710 --> 15:58.709
Conti!

15:59.350 --> 16:01.629
I knew we needed to do
something about him.

16:01.630 --> 16:03.469
So this is my fault? 
That figures.

16:03.470 --> 16:06.509
I didn't say it was your fault.
You're not listening to me.

16:06.510 --> 16:09.069
Most the time you've got
nothing to say any more.
Oh, fuck off!

16:09.070 --> 16:13.069
You fuck off! I'm done with you.

16:18.430 --> 16:22.429
Oh, shit! Go!

16:29.430 --> 16:30.829
Are you finishing with me?

16:30.830 --> 16:32.069
Do we have to do this right now?

16:32.070 --> 16:35.309
Do we have to do this right now?
Yes.

16:35.310 --> 16:37.309
Things with us...

16:37.310 --> 16:39.669
They haven't been
right for a while now.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.509
You're different.

16:41.510 --> 16:45.509
You've changed.

16:46.150 --> 16:50.149
We need to move. Come on!

17:21.030 --> 17:25.029
So, I guess that's it.

17:27.670 --> 17:30.109
I never wanted it to end like this.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.549
Something's not right.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.269
Maybe I fucked it up.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.309
No.

17:35.310 --> 17:39.309
It's me.

17:40.110 --> 17:44.109
I'm sorry.

17:45.590 --> 17:48.669
'There's something going on
with this heart you put in me.'

17:48.670 --> 17:50.349
There's something wrong with it.

17:50.350 --> 17:53.069
I promise you.
There is nothing wrong with it.

17:53.070 --> 17:55.429
Take it out. I want a different one.

17:55.430 --> 17:57.669
We don't have spares
just lying around.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.109
People die all the time.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.749
Look at him!

18:01.750 --> 18:05.749
He doesn't look like he's got
long to go. I'll have his heart.

18:08.550 --> 18:12.469
When a patient makes a
miraculous recovery,

18:12.470 --> 18:14.109
we don't hold a big inquest.

18:14.110 --> 18:18.109
We treat sick people,
and you're not sick any more.

18:21.550 --> 18:25.549
Job done!

18:34.830 --> 18:37.269
I did what you said.

18:37.270 --> 18:41.269
I let it play out.

18:41.990 --> 18:45.989
Me and Curtis...

18:46.550 --> 18:50.549
We're over.

19:18.110 --> 19:22.109
Hi!

19:23.470 --> 19:25.669
Hi.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.149
Did you know him?

19:27.150 --> 19:29.749
I've got his heart.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.789
What do you mean?

19:31.790 --> 19:34.749
I mean, when he died, they ripped
his heart out and stuck it in me.

19:34.750 --> 19:38.749
Bullshit!

19:45.910 --> 19:49.149
You OK?

19:49.150 --> 19:53.149
Something weird's happening to me.

19:57.710 --> 20:01.709
Seriously?

20:03.790 --> 20:05.709
I can teleport.

20:05.710 --> 20:08.629
I suppose that could be useful.

20:08.630 --> 20:12.629
Beats getting the bus.

20:14.870 --> 20:18.029
Thanks for the pyjamas.

20:18.030 --> 20:21.829
Hope they fit.
I had to guess your size.

20:21.830 --> 20:25.829
Always a nightmare.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.429
I should go.

20:29.430 --> 20:30.909
What, are you going?

20:30.910 --> 20:33.029
Got my community service.

20:33.030 --> 20:37.029
Er, you just told me I've inherited
the power to teleport from the guy

20:37.750 --> 20:41.229
whose heart was transplanted into me
and now you're going to walk off and

20:41.230 --> 20:45.029
leave it at that.
Well, fuck you very much!

20:45.030 --> 20:47.629
How do you want to leave it?

20:47.630 --> 20:51.629
Well, the least you could do
is ask me out for a drink.

21:07.110 --> 21:08.989
We should go away somewhere.

21:08.990 --> 21:12.989
Where would you like to go?

21:13.430 --> 21:16.709
I've always wanted
to go to Las Vegas.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.869
I'll take you there.

21:18.870 --> 21:22.869
I promise.

21:32.310 --> 21:36.309
I've got something for you.

21:37.950 --> 21:41.949
No-one's ever given
me keys to their place before.

21:45.430 --> 21:49.429
Now you can let yourself in.

21:56.470 --> 22:00.069
I've got to go.

22:00.070 --> 22:03.309
What?

22:03.310 --> 22:05.949
Nothing.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.949
All right, mystery man.

22:13.350 --> 22:17.349
I'm going to be late.

22:39.124 --> 22:43.123
Aggh!

22:51.084 --> 22:53.723
Alisha?

22:53.724 --> 22:57.723
Hiya.

Look, before you hear me thinking
it, I'll just tell you, yeah?

23:08.284 --> 23:12.283
Me and Curtis ended it last night.

23:12.924 --> 23:15.683
You all right?

23:15.684 --> 23:17.283
Yeah, I'm...I'm fine.

23:17.284 --> 23:21.283
If that was me, I'd be, like,
all crying my eyes out and shit.

23:24.644 --> 23:25.203

24:15.644 --> 24:19.003
Kelly! Let her go!

24:19.004 --> 24:21.403
You tell Conti,

24:21.404 --> 24:22.923
I want my money.

24:22.924 --> 24:25.603
There is no Conti!
There's no Conti!

24:25.604 --> 24:27.403
There's no money,
 just let her go!

24:27.404 --> 24:31.403
Tell Conti to bring my hundred grand
to the warehouse on Tipton Street.

24:40.684 --> 24:44.603
Kelly!

24:44.604 --> 24:48.603

The bloke who shot the new guy.

24:52.924 --> 24:56.483
He was on the estate again last
night. He's looking for this Conti.

24:56.484 --> 24:58.803
He thinks I'm Conti.

24:58.804 --> 25:00.083
Why does he think that?

25:00.084 --> 25:05.163
Because you told him I was.
Did I? Sorry, man. I think they've mended it.

25:10.896 --> 25:12.815
You want me to buy you a drink?

25:12.816 --> 25:15.815
I have never paid for a drink
from this machine before

25:15.816 --> 25:19.815
and I don't intend to start now.

25:23.736 --> 25:27.735
Thank you!

25:31.776 --> 25:36.135
Well, the bad news is they've
fixed the vending machine.
The guy with the red car and the gun...

25:36.136 --> 25:38.815
We were just talking about him.
Yeah, he's got Kelly.

25:38.816 --> 25:42.095
Oh, Jesus. He's going to shoot her,
and he going to kill her.

25:42.096 --> 25:43.575
I told you he was dangerous.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.135
Right, everybody calm down!

25:45.136 --> 25:49.135
Just think. Think and keep calm.

25:51.016 --> 25:54.215
Do something, you little freak!

25:59.136 --> 26:03.135
He's here.

of her!

GUNSHOT

26:43.936 --> 26:47.935
He's living the game.

26:48.176 --> 26:51.335
Where did all this come from?

26:51.336 --> 26:54.175
He was the guy in the mask.

26:54.176 --> 26:56.295
Give me my hundred grand.

26:56.296 --> 26:57.935
I haven't got your money, Jimmy.

26:57.936 --> 27:01.935
I haven't got your money, Jimmy.

27:04.736 --> 27:06.775

You can shove that up your arse.

27:24.616 --> 27:28.615
Put it on.

27:35.576 --> 27:36.615
He's Jimmy Cisco.

27:36.616 --> 27:39.335
He spent ten years
in prison for armed robbery.

27:39.336 --> 27:42.055
His lover and this crime boss,
Conti,

27:42.056 --> 27:45.815
they double-crossed him
on his wedding day.

27:45.816 --> 27:49.295
Hey, watch me run
over this fat bloke.

27:49.296 --> 27:52.615
Run, fat boy, run!

27:52.616 --> 27:56.615
Oh, he's fucked up my car!

GUNSHOTS FROM GAME

28:02.936 --> 28:05.135
We need to play the game for real.

28:05.136 --> 28:08.655
If we give him his money,
I think he'll let Kelly go.

28:08.656 --> 28:12.655
So now all we need
is a hundred grand?

28:15.056 --> 28:18.015
We could a rob a bank.

28:19.176 --> 28:21.775
Yeah, OK. Let's rob a bank.

28:21.776 --> 28:24.175
What's that?

28:24.176 --> 28:25.455
Nothing.

28:25.456 --> 28:27.335
Really? That's funny, innit?

28:27.336 --> 28:30.735
Because to me it sounded like you
were planning on robbing a bank.

28:30.736 --> 28:34.735
No, no, no.
I said, er, "Let's have a big wank."

28:35.416 --> 28:39.415
Communal masturbation.
The old circle jerk.

28:41.456 --> 28:44.975
Go and clean my car.

28:44.976 --> 28:48.455
That wasn't what they had in mind
when we got community service.

28:48.456 --> 28:52.095
Well, I'm a member of the
community and my car needs cleaning.

28:52.096 --> 28:55.015
And I don't give a shit.

28:55.016 --> 28:58.335
The man wants his car washed.

28:58.336 --> 28:59.455
(MOUTHS) What?

28:59.456 --> 29:03.455
He's giving us his keys
so we can clean his car.

29:05.016 --> 29:09.015
For fuck's sake.

29:13.936 --> 29:15.495
We're stealing his car.

29:15.496 --> 29:17.575
Right, yeah, I get it.

29:17.576 --> 29:21.575
Let's go.

29:28.296 --> 29:29.935
What's the plan?

29:29.936 --> 29:33.935
I turn invisible, I walk up to the
security van and I take the money.

29:34.696 --> 29:38.695
Works for me.

29:42.256 --> 29:46.255
Right, keep the engine running,
just in case he gets caught.

Fuck.

30:04.696 --> 30:06.895
How was it?

30:06.896 --> 30:10.015
Very easy.

30:10.016 --> 30:13.295
A bunch of young offenders
develop superpowers,

30:13.296 --> 30:17.295
and not one of us thinks of using
them to commit crime? Shame on us.

30:23.896 --> 30:26.735
More wine?

30:26.736 --> 30:30.735
Yeah, mate. Right.

30:42.016 --> 30:45.295
It's dead fruity.

30:45.296 --> 30:49.295
When I was in jail,
I thought about you.

30:49.656 --> 30:51.095
That's nice.

30:51.096 --> 30:53.415
I thought about you lying to me,

30:53.416 --> 30:56.575
stealing my money,

30:56.576 --> 30:58.695
screwing other men.

30:58.696 --> 31:00.815
You want to try some
positive thinking.

rabbits hopping around and shit.

31:29.456 --> 31:31.815
Do we think this is going to work?

31:31.816 --> 31:35.175
When he gets the money,
it should be game over.

31:35.176 --> 31:38.375
Then we beat the shit out of
him and take the money back, right?

31:38.376 --> 31:40.655
Come on, a hundred grand's
a lot of money.

31:40.656 --> 31:45.295

the ones who make money
and don't get caught,

31:57.856 --> 32:00.855
and have girlfriends
with enormous breast implants.

I thought we'd use our
powers to help people?
Nah!

We can talk about what we'regoing
to do with the money
afterwe get Kelly back.

but that's OK, right?

Fat Tony says you've got an
undercover cop in your organisation.

34:17.696 --> 34:21.695
See? That's why I don't play computer
games, cos they never bloody end.

34:26.936 --> 34:29.534
Who's a cop?

to get a chainsaw

34:47.476 --> 34:49.156

34:49.157 --> 34:53.156
you're going to tell me which
one of you is the undercover cop.

35:06.597 --> 35:07.836
Get your boyfriend to sort it out.

35:07.837 --> 35:10.076
Er, he's not my boyfriend.

35:10.077 --> 35:11.756
We've split up, all right?

35:11.757 --> 35:13.396
So you're available?

35:13.397 --> 35:17.396
Not to you.

35:18.837 --> 35:22.836
Where's that prick inthe mask
when we need him?

35:30.517 --> 35:34.396
I just need to get
a bit more momentum.

35:34.397 --> 35:37.916
Oh, yeah. Come on! Come on!

35:37.917 --> 35:40.156
A few more swings

35:40.157 --> 35:44.156

to summersault right off the hook.

got transplanted into her.

supposed to rescue us.

37:23.997 --> 37:27.996

37:34.197 --> 37:35.276
Get out of here!

37:35.277 --> 37:35.756
Get out of here...

37:35.757 --> 37:36.796
He's coming back!

37:36.797 --> 37:37.836
Now!

37:37.837 --> 37:39.796
I can't just do it whenever I want.

37:39.797 --> 37:43.796
Cos that would be far
too convenient and useful.

37:48.197 --> 37:50.756
Who are you?

37:50.757 --> 37:54.756
It's complicated.

37:58.197 --> 38:02.196
Hands.

38:02.717 --> 38:05.316
CHAINS RATTLE

38:05.317 --> 38:08.716
You need to tell him
you're the undercover cop.

38:08.717 --> 38:10.516
If he kills you, it doesn't matter.

38:10.517 --> 38:11.956
That's easy for you to say.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.956
You're not the one who has to be
dismembered with a chainsaw.

38:19.957 --> 38:23.076
I'm sorry you got into this.

38:23.077 --> 38:25.836
I really hope that
thing doesn't start.

38:25.837 --> 38:29.036
CHAINSAW WHIRRS

38:29.037 --> 38:33.036
CHAINSAW PULSES

38:37.557 --> 38:38.636
You're first.

38:38.637 --> 38:39.676
Please!

38:39.677 --> 38:40.476
Leave her alone!

38:40.477 --> 38:41.916
You can't do this!

38:41.917 --> 38:42.956
Don't touch her!

38:42.957 --> 38:45.716
Leave her alone,
 you fucking psycho!

38:45.717 --> 38:48.196
This is insane.

38:48.197 --> 38:50.876
Do something!

38:50.877 --> 38:54.076
Wait!

38:54.077 --> 38:55.716
All right, all right, it's me.

38:55.717 --> 38:58.076
I'm the undercover cop.

38:58.077 --> 39:02.076
So, fire up the chainsaw,
and get with the sawing.

39:02.357 --> 39:06.356
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd do it quickly and cleanly.

39:06.397 --> 39:09.396
Oi!

39:09.397 --> 39:13.396
Run! RUN!

39:49.717 --> 39:51.836
This is not real, it's just a game!

39:51.837 --> 39:55.836
You think this is a game?

39:57.037 --> 40:01.036
This is my life.

40:06.237 --> 40:10.236
Oh! No!

40:15.277 --> 40:17.516
Conti?

40:17.517 --> 40:20.756
I'm the undercover cop.

40:20.757 --> 40:24.756
No!

40:32.597 --> 40:36.596
Hold on. I'll get you an ambulance.

40:38.677 --> 40:40.516
It has to be like this.

40:40.517 --> 40:41.596
Why?

40:41.597 --> 40:43.996
So we can be together.

40:43.997 --> 40:45.956
No. I won't let you die!

40:45.957 --> 40:48.236
You have to,

40:48.237 --> 40:51.716
or I'll never be this person.

40:51.717 --> 40:55.716
I can't do this.

40:56.077 --> 41:00.076
It's going to be OK.

41:03.717 --> 41:07.716
You have to do something.

41:08.077 --> 41:12.076
There's petrol in that can.

41:14.477 --> 41:17.636
No-one can know it's me.

41:17.637 --> 41:20.836
Promise me you won't tell him.

41:20.837 --> 41:23.276
Promise me!

41:23.277 --> 41:25.796
You can't die. I love you.

41:25.797 --> 41:28.956
I'll still be here.

41:28.957 --> 41:32.116
I don't love him. I love you!

41:32.117 --> 41:36.116
It's you falling in love with him
that makes him become me.

41:40.117 --> 41:44.116
It's all coming together.

41:49.237 --> 41:50.916
No.

41:50.917 --> 41:52.716
Don't!

41:52.717 --> 41:56.716
Simon!

41:58.197 --> 41:59.796
Fuck!

41:59.797 --> 42:03.796
Oh, God!

42:30.917 --> 42:34.916
# Love is like a sin my love

42:39.157 --> 42:43.156
# For the one that feels it the most

42:46.117 --> 42:47.956
# Look at her

42:47.957 --> 42:51.956
# With her eyes like a flame

42:53.517 --> 42:55.116
# She will love you

42:55.117 --> 42:59.036
# Like a fly will never love you

42:59.037 --> 43:01.236
# Again... #

43:01.237 --> 43:03.556
The computer game guy.

43:03.557 --> 43:07.556
They've arrested him.

43:13.717 --> 43:15.916
That's what happens when blokes
spend all their time

43:15.917 --> 43:19.916
playing computer games and
wanking over porn on the internet.

43:22.997 --> 43:26.996
Right.

43:28.597 --> 43:32.596
# Love is like a sin my love

43:35.637 --> 43:39.636
# For the one
that feels it the most.. #

43:43.197 --> 43:45.396
Is everything all right?

43:45.397 --> 43:48.476
# ..with her smile like a flame

43:48.477 --> 43:50.796
# She will love you

43:50.797 --> 43:54.796
# Like a fly will never love you

43:55.837 --> 43:59.836
# Again. #

44:16.037 --> 44:18.396
Hi.

44:18.397 --> 44:19.796
What was that for?

44:19.797 --> 44:23.796
I'm not going to die and
I'm feelingpretty happy about it.

45:32.557 --> 45:33.996
Jesus!

45:33.997 --> 45:38.996
Sorry. I was just, er...
Piss off, you pervert!

45:41.237 --> 45:43.036
The cute, smiley popular girl...

45:43.037 --> 45:44.436
I think she murdered me.

45:44.437 --> 45:46.156
Hi.
Hi.

45:46.157 --> 45:47.916
Jesus! She's after Barry!

45:47.917 --> 45:49.916
Would you like to gofor a drink
with me?

45:49.917 --> 45:52.236
I'd love to.

45:52.237 --> 45:53.676
Why do you want to know my name?

45:53.677 --> 45:54.756
I think you're beautiful.

45:54.757 --> 45:55.676
I'm not a slag.

45:55.677 --> 45:57.836
Why are the coppers after you?

45:57.837 --> 46:00.436
I didn't mean to hurt him,
but I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

46:00.437 --> 46:01.636
Especially not you.

46:01.637 --> 46:05.636
Get an ambulance!
Get a fucking ambulance!
