03:13.800 --> 03:16.600
They say big dreams
are sold in some cities.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.880
Because the city and its monotonous
life needs the vision and color

03:20.000 --> 03:22.840
of a beautiful dream to make itself big.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.680
My city is somewhat similar.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.920
Where I lived the dream of
becoming a super model.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.640
I, Meghna Mathur...

03:33.240 --> 03:36.120
have dreams bigger than this city.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.720
Since you were tired of
eating the potato pancakes

03:41.840 --> 03:43.760
I made radish pancakes for you.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.320
-Mom, this has a lot of butter.
-Have it.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.680
I told you I am on a diet.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.960
Having one won't make a difference.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.880
Of course, it will.
I have to lose two kilos.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.800
I got my portfolio yesterday.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.440
I was thinking of leaving
for Mumbai on Monday.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.520
That reminds me, I have
spoken to Mehra Associates.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.640
They have agreed on an
internship with them

04:11.720 --> 04:13.840
while you finish your chartered
accountants course.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.200
In fact, you can join them on Monday.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.040
Papa, you didn't hear me.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.640
I want to go to Mumbai...

04:21.600 --> 04:22.600
to become a model.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.160
I don't want to do any internship.

04:28.240 --> 04:32.160
Meghna, I've told you earlier.

04:33.720 --> 04:34.760
Never mind.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.240
Listen, dreaming isn't bad but--

04:38.320 --> 04:39.320
But what, Papa?

04:40.880 --> 04:42.720
Do I've to dream according to you?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.680
Can't I have my own dreams?

04:48.680 --> 04:49.760
I have decided.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.120
I want to go to Mumbai.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.840
In that case, there is
nothing left to discuss.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.800
Do as you wish.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.120
But don't expect anything from me.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.680
I was expecting for
a little encouragement but--

05:03.800 --> 05:05.440
Encouragement for what?

05:08.480 --> 05:13.920
You lost your mind after
winning that local beauty pageant.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.600
It was my fault.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.560
"Want to be a model!"

05:34.960 --> 05:38.200
Though I have spoken to
Brother Baldev...

05:38.280 --> 05:40.440
call me as soon as you reach.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.280
Papa...

05:49.720 --> 05:53.640
Don't worry, dear.
Everything will be alright.

05:54.960 --> 05:55.960
Give me a hug.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.360
You were so young during
Brother Kuldeep's wedding.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.720
Divya was really happy ever since
she learnt you were coming.

06:07.000 --> 06:07.840
Sister...

06:07.920 --> 06:09.760
Mom was mentioning
that you are going to be a model.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.600
Mom, it would be fun to watch
her on television.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.680
Divya...

06:17.080 --> 06:19.760
Come, Meghna.
I will take you to your room.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.760
Of course.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.120
This is Divya's room.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.520
You will have to share it with her.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.560
No problem.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.960
It's a little small...

06:32.520 --> 06:34.760
but you won't be here for long.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.720
Maybe a month, until I get work.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.160
Alright. You can freshen up.
Meanwhile, I will serve breakfast.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.480
No, it's in the evening.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.560
I'm sorry, I'm late.
But what could I do?

07:22.720 --> 07:24.400
Vinay wouldn't let me go.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.200
This evening we have to
do fittings for Duggu.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.320
Duggu?

07:33.640 --> 07:35.480
Duggu! Hrithik!

07:39.720 --> 07:40.560
I'm okay.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.520
You know, when I saw you in that silly
beauty contest in Chandigarh...

07:47.920 --> 07:49.840
I'm here because you
were confident about me.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.800
Now everything depends on you.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.600
-Do you have your pictures?
-Yes, of course!

08:03.280 --> 08:04.280
What's the matter?

08:13.640 --> 08:14.680
Who are you looking for?

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920
Here?

08:18.480 --> 08:19.400
Shomu.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.480
A Godmother to the newcomers.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Hey! What man!

08:26.440 --> 08:28.120
Have you ever traveled by
plane before?

08:28.440 --> 08:29.960
I'm sending you to a foreign location.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.320
So what if the role is small?

08:31.600 --> 08:32.799
You will suffer one day.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.400
And Shweta, you have a two day job.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.720
No one gives more than 25,000 rupees
for a Punjabi dance number.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.080
I would have done it,
if I were taller.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.880
Ma'am, you are being called inside.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.280
Who is it?

08:52.400 --> 08:53.360
Are you new?

08:53.440 --> 08:55.040
-Are you from the North?
-Yes.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
What's your size?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.120
Listen, I am not interested.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.240
It's the client who wants to know.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.480
Hey! I was just about to call you.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.000
I'm sending a girl for the catalogue.
Check her out.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.120
What is your name?

09:11.360 --> 09:12.960
Meghna... Meghna Mathur.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.560
Her name is Meghna Mathur.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
Bye.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.880
Okay, listen. You have
an audition tomorrow.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.800
B 409, Adarsh Nagar.
Be there at eleven o'clock.

09:21.880 --> 09:22.920
Take the number from this chick.

09:23.120 --> 09:23.960
Chick?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
An audition tomorrow?

09:25.120 --> 09:26.520
Yes. And listen, if it works

09:26.600 --> 09:29.080
I'll take a twenty per cent cut.
Is that clear?

09:29.160 --> 09:30.360
Okay.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.160
Stop here. I think this is the place.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.920
How much is the bill?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Fifteen rupees.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.120
Take this.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.720
I recently did two advertisements.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.040
What about you?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.840
I'm an air hostess.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.360
I got bored of serving people.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.520
So now I want to be a model.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.680
Do you have a problem with that?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.200
-No.
-Then stop bothering me.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.800
It is a soap commercial, right?

10:09.880 --> 10:10.880
Alright, I will be there.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.720
I am at Adarsh Nagar right now.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.320
I will be at Famous Studios in an hour.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
Yes.

10:27.840 --> 10:28.840
Are you auditioning for the first time?

10:30.120 --> 10:31.200
How did you guess?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.320
Only novices walk around
with their portfolio.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.920
Seasoned models, like us,
send it in earlier or email it to them.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.680
Since nine months
I am a veteran struggler.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.120
That's me.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.720
Yes.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.840
You can't be tired in
just three or four auditions.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.800
It takes up to three
hundred auditions at times

11:18.920 --> 11:20.200
to finally get a break.

11:23.960 --> 11:24.920
Okay. I'll call you later.

11:25.000 --> 11:25.960
One week is over...

11:26.040 --> 11:27.800
Will you do a lingerie advertisement?

11:27.920 --> 11:28.720
Shomu...

11:28.800 --> 11:33.000
I have told you a million times!
It's lingerie not Lin-guh-ree.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.560
The same thing.
Will you do it?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.840
Meghna won't do such
degrading commercials. Alright?

11:39.920 --> 11:41.040
Why are you getting angry?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.920
What is so degrading in
a lingerie advertisement?

11:43.040 --> 11:44.600
Haven't you seen commercially
successful models in calendars?

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
They wear whatever they are told.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.160
Attitude walks in before stardom.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.520
And you go to Bandra.
I'll give you an address.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.720
Don't take her seriously.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.760
-We are going for a fashion show tomorrow.
-Fashion show?

12:05.040 --> 12:08.320
Rahul Arora! I have only
seen him on television.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.200
So tomorrow evening it is
Rahul Arora's fashion show. Live!

12:12.280 --> 12:14.520
Honey, I have told you so many times
not to keep your phone switched off.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.280
Not the same thing again!

12:25.160 --> 12:27.440
I should at least know where you are

12:27.520 --> 12:28.680
and what you're up to.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.800
We've been together
for six months.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.560
I know you quite well.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.480
Now what?

12:46.400 --> 12:47.200
For once.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.520
Try to understand.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.200
-Okay, I am hanging up the phone.
-Darling, please.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.520
-We are meeting tonight, right?
-Yes.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.360
Rahul...

13:05.440 --> 13:06.480
Yes, mother.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
What can I say?

13:11.680 --> 13:13.200
The whole world is talking.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.960
All those women at temple are now
laughing at me.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.240
They say that I don't want
you to get married.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.200
Let them talk.
How does it affect us?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.800
How can I bear it?

13:21.960 --> 13:23.760
We can't go against society.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.200
It's high time you get married.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.200
Brother Kishen had called from London.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.120
He sent some pictures through email.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.400
Mom! I don't want to see
any pictures of girls.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.800
-At least look at them.
-Mom, please.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.640
Don't bother me at least today.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.800
I have a show tomorrow
and I'm really nervous.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.680
This isn't a garden.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.960
Couturier, lets see it.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.800
Couturier, what is this?

14:14.360 --> 14:15.760
This is the show stopper's outfit.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.840
Increase the length of the slit.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.920
There are only three hours
left for the show.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.520
Please leave.
Don't stress me out.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.040
Please, quickly.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.200
Rahul, pay attention now okay?
We have a run through, alright?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.560
Yes, but where is Shonali?

14:26.840 --> 14:28.640
When is she ever punctual
that today will be an exception?

14:28.720 --> 14:32.040
She is your show stopper
and your favourite.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.000
Why aren't we sitting in the front row?
It's absolutely empty.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.560
Are you nuts?
That's reserved seating, darling.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.920
Just watch what happens
there in a while.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.240
-Meghna.
-Yes?

15:24.360 --> 15:25.200
Look there.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.400
There in the front row...

15:29.480 --> 15:31.400
He is Rahul's biggest rival

15:31.520 --> 15:33.360
and his most loyal audience.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.440
He doesn't miss a single show of Rahul.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.680
And the one sitting there?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.640
There, on right hand corner...

16:05.200 --> 16:08.040
Anisha Roy, the owner
of Profiles Agency.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.760
Every top model since the past
six years is from her agency.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.800
His brand is the biggest
status symbol in the fashion world.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.800
Everyone dances to
his tunes. Everyone.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.480
Charisma

16:42.560 --> 16:44.040
Charisma

16:44.120 --> 16:47.640
Yo blaze up the walk

16:55.720 --> 16:58.080
This is the charisma of bodies

16:58.240 --> 17:00.600
This is the charisma of destiny

17:00.680 --> 17:03.160
Charisma also brings wealth

17:03.320 --> 17:05.680
Charisma also gives us a reason

17:12.480 --> 17:13.520
Charisma

17:15.160 --> 17:16.200
Charisma

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
Charisma

17:29.800 --> 17:30.800
I'm in the middle of my show.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.920
I told you not to call me.

17:37.120 --> 17:40.960
God knows how many times
you'll break up and patch up.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.920
It flows like fire

17:49.720 --> 17:52.920
It walks in style

17:54.720 --> 17:59.720
It sparks a fire in the hearts

18:00.240 --> 18:01.320
This charisma

18:01.520 --> 18:02.600
This charisma

18:03.000 --> 18:05.080
This is the charisma of fashion

18:05.280 --> 18:07.760
This charisma

18:07.840 --> 18:10.280
This is the charisma of fashion

18:10.680 --> 18:15.480
This is the charisma of fashion

18:15.680 --> 18:20.480
-This is the charisma of fashion
-Okay, go.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.760
The fire

18:48.760 --> 18:51.400
Charisma

18:52.960 --> 18:53.960
Charisma

18:55.440 --> 18:56.480
Charisma

18:58.000 --> 18:59.040
Charisma

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
Charisma

19:05.720 --> 19:06.720
Charisma

19:14.080 --> 19:19.600
This is the charisma of fashion

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
Charisma

19:36.600 --> 19:37.600
Charisma

19:39.080 --> 19:40.080
Charisma

19:41.600 --> 19:42.600
Charisma

20:07.160 --> 20:08.440
I spoke to Manish.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.920
She is here to be a model.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.200
She'll dazzle the ramp.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.040
By the way I have my pictures
with me right now.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.200
I'll show you.

20:41.160 --> 20:41.960
Here.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.920
I agree you may not like the pictures
but you need not throw them.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.720
It doesn't look like you have one
in your photographs.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.080
Who would you go to
if you were in my place?

21:05.160 --> 21:07.320
Darling, I wouldn't ever be in your place.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.160
You know Rohit, Kartik is
very busy these days.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.280
I mean look at her.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.600
What difference will
one photo shoot make?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.720
I'm sure if you put in
a word he will agree.

21:32.360 --> 21:36.200
He charges 50,000 rupees,
along with make up and styling.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.600
And separate charges for costumes.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.480
Can she afford it?

21:42.320 --> 21:43.160
But Meghna...

21:46.320 --> 21:47.800
Will 7000 rupees do for now?

21:48.040 --> 21:49.400
I only have that much
with me right now.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.360
I'm making an appointment for

21:54.520 --> 21:56.960
the 20th of next month
at eight in the morning.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.960
If you cancel you forfeit
the advance. Okay?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.280
Manav, I told you earlier as well.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.280
If you want to progress in this industry

22:11.760 --> 22:13.360
you have to compromise.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.440
Do you think that
all the successful models

22:17.520 --> 22:19.760
found work just like that?

22:22.160 --> 22:23.480
They also had to compromise.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.280
I can't do what others do.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.120
I want to be successful
on my own terms.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.080
Not like this.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.040
I am speaking from
Vinay Khosla's office, ma'am.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.560
I'm here with your
outfits for the trial.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.520
What are you doing here?
Did you have a meeting?

23:04.600 --> 23:07.040
Yes, kind of.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.080
That's what I came here for,
but it didn't work out.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.320
You should have at least
introduced me to him.

23:27.080 --> 23:27.920
Rohit.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.440
-Now what?
-Lunch.

23:33.280 --> 23:37.120
Enjoy, Meghna.
I only have mineral water.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.400
Especially when someone
else is paying the bill.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.240
But how can we eat out here?
It's so expensive.

23:45.880 --> 23:49.000
Mrs. Agarwal is an NRI.
She is very rich.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.600
She told me to have lunch
and add the bill to her account.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.840
Shomu had called up.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.920
-What?
-Yes.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.320
She said there is
a party at some hotel.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.840
If I want to make contacts,
I must go.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.320
Should I go?

24:06.280 --> 24:07.960
Networking is very important.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.920
What fun!

24:10.960 --> 24:13.400
Lunch and dinner both
at a five star hotel.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.720
Stop fooling around.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.320
The girls have been waiting in
the lobby since long.

24:32.720 --> 24:36.160
Listen, there are three girls.
One of them is new.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.760
Explain it to all of them properly.
Got it?

24:39.200 --> 24:41.240
Yes, I'll be there in five minutes.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.400
Sorry, Sameer.
I have to go.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.560
Not Sameer, Janet.
My name is Sohail.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.280
Stay together everybody. Okay?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.040
Where is Bajaj?

25:21.680 --> 25:23.320
The "Kanta laga" type.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.800
No, thank you. I don't drink.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.760
Drink up. It's free and imported too.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.120
Shomu said that I could
make some contacts here.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.680
-Drink ma'am.
-Contacts? And that too here?

26:08.200 --> 26:12.520
Just smile and look pretty
for the photographs.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.600
And then our job is done.
That's it!

26:38.960 --> 26:41.080
No, not as yet but hopefully...

26:42.840 --> 26:45.240
Send me some of your photographs.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.560
I suggest that you
drop in to my office.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.160
Janet, Meet Mr...

26:58.240 --> 27:01.360
-Mukesh Tyagi. He runs an ad agency.
-Yes.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.040
He says he has a lot of contacts.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.800
I've been meeting him in parties
since the past five years.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.160
Listen, fraud.

27:13.240 --> 27:17.200
You won't catch any fish with such tricks.
Go from here.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.280
What's the problem with
you small town girls?

27:23.200 --> 27:26.120
Anyone who speaks halfway decent English,
can get anywhere with you.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
Come on, let's go.

27:27.720 --> 27:28.840
"Want to make contacts."

27:35.240 --> 27:39.240
Dolly, that's your 15,000 rupees.
I've cut 5000 rupees for the advance.

27:39.320 --> 27:40.720
-There are 10,000 rupees in the packet.
-Okay, fine.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
And here's your 18,000 rupees.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.200
Don't ask for conveyance.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.560
We've got a party like this
after a month. Got it?

27:48.080 --> 27:49.320
And Meghna...

27:49.680 --> 27:51.640
It's your first time so
I'm paying you 12,000 rupees.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.120
What are you looking at?
Here take it.

27:55.720 --> 27:56.560
Don't you want it?

27:56.920 --> 27:59.560
But money for what?

28:00.120 --> 28:02.520
You're paid for the work you did.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.560
Work?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.680
Didn't you pose for the camera?

28:07.240 --> 28:10.000
People like having girls
at such parties.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.920
Mr. Bajaj is an event manager.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.720
He contacts me for the models.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.320
It's like

28:16.400 --> 28:19.240
pretty girls get the glamor
quotient for such parties.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.880
High society calls this
eye candy, understood?

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
Now take it.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.320
Take.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.040
And here, Reema.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.320
What's this? Where have you been?

28:29.520 --> 28:31.000
Don't you want your money?

28:33.240 --> 28:34.640
The world of glamor is strange.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.600
You are so desperate
to achieve success...

28:38.680 --> 28:43.080
that the difference between
what's right and wrong begins to blur.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.720
And there's barely
any time to think about it.

28:47.600 --> 28:52.040
As the date for the portfolio got closer

28:52.200 --> 28:55.040
my hopes began to diminish.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.960
Meghna darling,
why are you so tense?

29:02.160 --> 29:03.120
How is it possible, Rohit?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.480
Only six days to go for the portfolio.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.640
And I still don't have the money.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.120
If I don't pay the entire amount

29:10.200 --> 29:11.240
then I forfeit the advance.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.440
Shomu's offer is still open.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.200
You could give it a try.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.360
Janet, show some more skin.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.600
I've shown enough for
what I've been paid. Get it?

29:43.680 --> 29:44.920
Fine, let's get on with it.

29:58.920 --> 29:59.960
Don't feel shy.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.840
It's weird for the first ten seconds.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.280
After that, you will get used to it.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.680
Come on, madam.
Take off your gown.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.920
There are other models
waiting for the shoot.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.040
Quickly, there are three more to go.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.360
Come on, madam.
Make it quick.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.480
Do not stress.
There's nothing to worry about.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.880
-Have some tea. You will feel better.
-No.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.360
-Janet, your cheque.
-Thank you.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.760
Meghna, that's yours. You remember
my commission, right?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.360
Yes, but Shomu are you sure this

31:06.480 --> 31:09.320
advertisement won't be released here?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.880
I told you that
it won't get released here.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.640
This advertisement is only for Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh. Is that clear?

31:15.720 --> 31:18.120
Why are you so tensed?

31:18.480 --> 31:19.560
Now you've done the advertisement.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.960
Thanks. I don't smoke.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.880
Meghna, don't think so much.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.440
The lesser you think,
the more you will make.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.120
Oh, yes! Tomorrow is
your portfolio shoot, isn't it?

32:18.440 --> 32:20.400
Anisha, didn't I mention that

32:20.600 --> 32:23.360
I haven't seen a striking
impressive face recently.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.240
So, you want to be a model?

32:40.480 --> 32:41.520
No, ma'am.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.480
You know the city gets 200 girls
everyday who aspire to be a model.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.480
I know.

32:56.360 --> 33:00.680
But how many of them
get a chance to sit across you?

33:08.800 --> 33:10.040
But that will not suffice.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.800
What's your name?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.240
Meghna, ma'am.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.840
Meghna...

33:20.640 --> 33:24.440
In fashion industry,
even a little talent will do.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.680
But if you have the wrong attitude...

33:27.560 --> 33:28.960
nothing will work.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.600
Use it with prudence or
it will be mistaken for arrogance.

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760
That won't happen.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.520
Yes.

33:45.320 --> 33:48.960
Won't you be there to guide me?

33:52.760 --> 33:53.880
What are you doing tomorrow?

34:13.400 --> 34:16.000
Actually, I don't know
a lot about wines.

34:16.239 --> 34:19.120
Don't worry there are
very few over here who do.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.800
You've either tried wine
for the first time

34:41.239 --> 34:42.320
or you had a lot of it.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.840
That's why you can't tell the difference.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.360
These models are so thin.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.720
I've heard they do drugs!

35:07.320 --> 35:08.680
Not all of them, maybe a few.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.000
I heard that designer
Varun Ramani's wife is

35:13.080 --> 35:15.960
having an affair with her gym instructor.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.760
Rajan Sodhi has hidden
cameras in his wife's bedroom.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.560
You seem quite intelligent.
So what's this craze for modeling?

36:05.600 --> 36:09.400
You too are intelligent and
are also in the same business.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.360
So the comparison is with me.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.120
It's not like that.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.920
It doesn't matter.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.160
I judge people by their ambition.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.480
Really? So what do you think of me?

36:24.080 --> 36:26.400
You've hardly told me
anything about yourself.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.960
What can I say?
Like thousands of girls...

36:30.040 --> 36:32.280
I too want to be a successful model.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.520
-But there's a small difference.
-What's that?

36:38.640 --> 36:42.080
That I'm better than the rest.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.480
That you are.

36:48.040 --> 36:48.840
Shall we go?

36:57.840 --> 37:01.720
You've been meeting people like
Kartik and Sarin.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.560
The formula to this business

37:05.040 --> 37:08.160
is the right timing,
contacts and publicity.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.600
I will feature you in Leena Mehta's show.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.840
Everything is happening so quickly.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.840
Everything depends on what
you make of this opportunity.

37:32.480 --> 37:34.440
And, where you want to go from here.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.720
I know where I want to be.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.000
-Shona...
-Why is Ritu calling you?

38:10.280 --> 38:11.800
-Shona, my phone...
-You told me that she doesn't call you.

38:11.880 --> 38:12.840
Shona, give me my phone.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.880
-Why did you lie to me?
-Leave my phone.

38:13.960 --> 38:14.800
Why is she calling you?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.800
-Why?
-What are you doing?

38:18.880 --> 38:19.880
Are you the only one who can help her?

38:22.920 --> 38:25.160
-Let me talk to her.
-Shona, leave it.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.280
Shona!

38:30.240 --> 38:31.960
You bastard! I have a show tomorrow.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.880
Come on, Shona. I told you
there is nothing like that.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.680
She just needs help.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.320
This is my avant-garde collection.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.800
It's completely different
from my earlier work.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.320
I mean, this collection is inspired
by my childhood memories.

38:51.440 --> 38:54.040
You will see influences
of those images.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.280
She should have at least
taken off the label.

39:04.280 --> 39:08.000
Gets it from a local market in Bangkok
and calls it her "avant-garde" collection.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.000
Will you do my makeup
or should I stop the show?

39:45.320 --> 39:46.880
-You look sad.
-Not at all.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.360
-Would you like to go back?
-No.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.800
Chandu, why are you
clicking a nobody?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.280
Fool, do you know how
big a socialite she is?

40:19.640 --> 40:22.640
Socialite? Once upon
a time she was a B-grade actress.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.840
Today she is a self proclaimed
socialite and designer.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
Are you kidding me?

40:27.360 --> 40:31.120
She is at all functions,
weddings, parties, awards.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.920
She doesn't even spare baby showers.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.360
Really?

40:34.440 --> 40:35.800
Yes, even baby showers.

40:36.520 --> 40:39.200
Delete her pictures!

40:47.600 --> 40:48.560
What brings you here?

40:52.800 --> 40:54.600
I got to know that
it is your first show.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.240
I thought I should wish you luck.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.640
He's probably doing his research.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.600
He's making a movie on
the fashion industry.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.600
He makes realistic films.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.680
He won't even spare
the world of fashion.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.080
Now remember, I want a lot of drama.

41:28.920 --> 41:32.880
Binal, walk tall and beautiful.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.280
-Meghna, this is a big show for you.
-Yes.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.120
Shonali!

42:15.920 --> 42:17.960
I've been tantalizing for you

42:18.160 --> 42:20.840
In this air and atmosphere

42:22.040 --> 42:23.920
You've tormented me with your promise

42:24.160 --> 42:27.280
God is looking at this atmosphere

42:28.640 --> 42:30.440
I admitted to my crime
Still I got none

42:30.560 --> 42:33.600
In this air and atmosphere

42:34.400 --> 42:36.240
You've tormented me with your promise

42:36.440 --> 42:39.680
God is looking at this atmosphere

42:51.760 --> 42:54.200
I shall give up my life

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
I shall give up my life

42:58.320 --> 43:02.720
I shall give up my life
For your love

43:04.080 --> 43:06.640
I shall give up my life

43:06.720 --> 43:09.200
I shall give up my life

43:10.800 --> 43:14.960
I shall give up my life
For your love

43:17.480 --> 43:22.160
It's like a letter with drenched dreams

43:23.600 --> 43:28.160
It's like an addiction of drenched love

43:28.720 --> 43:34.120
I shall give up my life

43:35.160 --> 43:39.960
I shall give up my life
For your love

43:40.840 --> 43:46.000
I shall give up my life

43:47.480 --> 43:52.760
I shall give up my life
For your love

43:54.160 --> 43:56.080
I've been tantalizing for you

43:56.440 --> 43:59.400
In this air and atmosphere

44:00.480 --> 44:02.320
You've tormented me with your promise

44:02.440 --> 44:05.440
God is looking at this atmosphere

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
I admitted to my crime
Still I got none

44:08.880 --> 44:11.920
In this air and atmosphere

44:12.720 --> 44:14.560
You've tormented me with your promise

44:14.680 --> 44:17.640
God is looking at this atmosphere

44:38.840 --> 44:40.640
We'll have to extend your contract.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I had to become a model.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.600
And dieting made me like this.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.560
You and diet?

45:25.240 --> 45:27.400
During college she used
to carry a box of sugar candy.

45:27.480 --> 45:30.560
A box of sugar candy?

45:34.080 --> 45:35.360
Should I reveal your secrets?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.560
-Besides, I am very upset with you.
-Why?

45:40.760 --> 45:42.480
You are a model now and
you didn't even bother to call.

45:44.520 --> 45:47.800
You are an A list designer
and I'm a struggling B list model.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.080
How could I call?

46:15.280 --> 46:17.040
Such good confidence in your first show!

46:54.240 --> 46:56.400
After many trials and troubles
I reached a place...

46:57.000 --> 47:00.400
where I could see my dream
taking shape clearly.

47:01.600 --> 47:05.720
But my journey ahead went
through strange phases.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.280
Old relationships though
near seemed far away.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.160
And new relationships
started growing closer.

47:20.520 --> 47:21.800
We are going to get a huge bill.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.360
Just relax and order.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.840
-You haven't changed a bit.
-Why do you say that?

47:49.320 --> 47:52.520
I was just being polite and
you actually joined us.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.000
You know, throughout college,
I used to foot her canteen bills.

47:58.480 --> 48:00.800
So I thought it was payback time today.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.400
Unfortunately, it's Meghna's treat.

48:09.520 --> 48:11.320
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

48:11.800 --> 48:14.960
Do you have a brother
or cousin who looks...

48:15.240 --> 48:16.080
just like you do.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.120
Listen, you do know that...

48:27.200 --> 48:28.960
the venue for tomorrow's
rehearsal has changed?

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
Santosh...

48:50.680 --> 48:51.840
It's two in the morning, Meghna.

48:52.960 --> 48:54.320
You've been coming in late every night.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.920
You should be a little more responsible.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.040
Even the neighbours are complaining.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.680
This can't continue here.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.200
I'm sorry, aunt, but my job keeps me--

49:04.280 --> 49:05.600
I know what it keeps you at.

49:07.960 --> 49:10.880
Divya brought this to
show us from the neighbors.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.240
What influence will it have on her?

49:14.880 --> 49:17.000
Meghna, we can't let your career be

49:17.080 --> 49:19.120
a negative influence on Divya.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.800
I suggest you...

49:22.400 --> 49:23.840
to look for alternate accommodation.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.320
Santosh, it's so late in the night...

49:26.440 --> 49:28.320
She doesn't need to leave immediately.

49:30.280 --> 49:31.520
She can leave after a couple of days.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
It's okay, aunt.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.560
I'll leave right away.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.440
Nothing.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.720
I left home in a huff but
I didn't know where to go.

50:06.640 --> 50:10.040
Janet is in Goa and
Rohit stays with his parents.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.840
I don't know anyone else in Mumbai.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.920
I'm really sorry but...

50:15.000 --> 50:16.320
There is no need for an explanation.

50:17.880 --> 50:18.960
I'm glad that you called.

50:20.560 --> 50:21.840
It's only for tonight.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.720
I'll look for another place tomorrow.

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
Meghna, this is Mumbai.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.560
You may find God but not accommodation.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.400
That too a single woman...

50:30.960 --> 50:33.400
a model, no way.

50:35.480 --> 50:37.560
Yes, there is one place though...

50:37.640 --> 50:39.880
where you can share an apartment.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.080
-Where?
-Here.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.480
Actually, I was looking
for a room mate.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.080
I don't have regular work and...

50:52.120 --> 50:53.240
the rent is too high.

50:57.360 --> 50:59.680
But Manav, both of us...

50:59.760 --> 51:01.640
in the same apartment...

51:05.600 --> 51:06.480
This isn't Chandigarh.

51:10.760 --> 51:15.080
We'll share all the expenses.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.440
We can share everything...

51:18.520 --> 51:21.680
but the bedrooms will be separate, right?

51:23.880 --> 51:25.120
Of course they will be separate!

51:37.280 --> 51:39.040
Anisha, I'm sorry I had to call you.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.400
Where is Shonali?

51:40.480 --> 51:43.600
The entire unit has been waiting for
two hours. There is no sign of her.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
This has become a habit.

52:08.240 --> 52:09.880
The entire unit has been
waiting for two hours.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.080
And you are back
to this awful habit.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.640
This is the third complaint.

52:23.760 --> 52:26.240
Our clients pay a lot of
money for your time.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.520
My agency is my reputation.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.400
That's the reason you
stand here today.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.920
If you don't take control of yourself...

52:32.240 --> 52:35.520
then there are several others
who are eager to replace you. Got it?

52:44.440 --> 52:46.040
-Don't worry. I've talked to her.
-Megha, Gauri...

52:46.280 --> 52:49.160
If she misbehaves again,
call me up.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.520
Vinay, isn't this a bit over the top?

53:13.200 --> 53:15.760
You are about to do
Bobby Chopra's film in Europe.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.280
You guys do very realistic films and...

53:32.560 --> 53:34.880
-According to my character graph...
-Dear, no...

53:37.040 --> 53:39.880
Koko, the amount the producer is
spending on your clothes

53:39.960 --> 53:42.800
exceeds the total budget
of this film production.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.600
So if you're done arguing,
can we rehearse?

53:45.840 --> 53:47.080
The entire unit has been
waiting for two hours

53:47.160 --> 53:48.680
and a lot of people work on daily wages.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.520
Come on, take it.

54:00.680 --> 54:01.520
-Hey, Manav.
-Ya.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.680
Whom are you paired
with in Anamika's show?

54:03.920 --> 54:05.040
I have been paired with Rajneesh.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.360
Now your entry is along with me.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.000
We open the show together now.

54:13.360 --> 54:14.160
But how come?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.520
Because our choreographer believes

54:16.600 --> 54:18.000
that we make a great pair.

54:36.960 --> 54:38.720
There is something special

54:38.800 --> 54:40.600
There is something nearby

54:40.680 --> 54:44.040
There is an unusual feeling

54:44.360 --> 54:47.960
There is some closeness and distance

54:48.040 --> 54:51.400
There is some loneliness smiling

54:51.480 --> 54:53.400
Is this some intoxication?

54:53.480 --> 54:55.000
Is this some kind of trust?

54:55.080 --> 54:56.960
May be it's love

54:57.040 --> 54:58.760
It's love may be

54:58.840 --> 55:00.720
Is this some form of spring?

55:00.800 --> 55:02.400
Is this some type of wait?

55:02.480 --> 55:04.280
May be it's love

55:04.360 --> 55:06.400
It's love may be

55:10.120 --> 55:13.800
There is something special
There is something nearby

55:13.880 --> 55:17.480
There is an unusual feeling

55:17.560 --> 55:21.200
There is some closeness and distance

55:21.280 --> 55:24.520
There is some loneliness smiling

55:24.600 --> 55:26.400
Is this some intoxication?

55:26.480 --> 55:28.160
Is this some kind of trust?

55:28.320 --> 55:29.960
May be it's love

55:30.040 --> 55:31.800
It's love may be

55:32.000 --> 55:33.600
Is this some form of spring?

55:33.680 --> 55:35.600
Is this some type of wait?

55:35.680 --> 55:37.360
May be it's love

55:37.440 --> 55:39.400
It's love may be

55:56.240 --> 55:59.400
What should I say?

55:59.480 --> 56:03.360
It's not my fault

56:03.560 --> 56:11.280
The heart saw someone like it's own

56:11.440 --> 56:18.240
I had this one bet with my heart

56:18.320 --> 56:25.400
Why do I feel this loss like a win?

56:25.600 --> 56:29.000
Why is this calling there?
Why is restlessness there?

56:29.120 --> 56:30.880
May be it's love

56:30.960 --> 56:33.040
It's love may be

56:33.120 --> 56:36.400
Magic has taken over me
There is no self control

56:36.560 --> 56:38.720
May be it's love

56:39.400 --> 56:41.560
It's love may be

56:44.080 --> 56:46.160
It's love may be

56:47.840 --> 56:51.400
There is something special
There is something nearby

56:51.560 --> 56:55.520
There is an unusual feeling

57:22.720 --> 57:24.280
May be it's love

57:26.560 --> 57:29.720
May be it's love

57:42.760 --> 57:43.960
-Please give me the phone.
-No.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.000
-Please give me the phone.
-No way.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.000
Where are you?

57:51.080 --> 57:52.360
At home.

57:55.120 --> 57:55.920
Right now?

58:21.760 --> 58:28.280
Anisha told me that you wanted to see me.
I had to rush.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.320
I've brought my portfolio along.
I also have it on CD.

58:32.600 --> 58:35.600
If you want to have a look.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.160
There's no need for this.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.040
Would you like to be a show stopper?

58:42.840 --> 58:43.960
It's for Vinay Khosla.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.240
The show is in four days.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.840
Vinay Khosla?

59:12.160 --> 59:14.600
Half of them are doing shows and the
other half are in abroad.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.880
What's happening with the new girl?
Is she ready?

59:36.880 --> 59:38.720
But it looks so much cooler here.

59:40.560 --> 59:41.760
She is an absolute new girl.

59:58.960 --> 1:00:01.560
Meghna, you should because
he was saying that...

1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:02.480
Rohit.

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:18.200
Actually it's not his fault.
I did it.

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:20.960
I thought that if--

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:23.320
You thought?

1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:27.840
You don't need to
use your brains, okay?

1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:33.680
It's such an insignificant thing...

1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:38.960
An insignificant thing?

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:41.640
This is the show stopper outfit.

1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:45.560
The media will be watching.

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:49.640
And even if you sell yourself,
you can't afford this dress.

1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:56.400
And listen, I really don't care
about your relationship with Sarin.

1:00:58.400 --> 1:00:59.840
My relationship with Sarin?

1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:23.040
Send four girls in the end.
Change the finale. I don't care.

1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:50.760
Meghna!

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:52.680
Rohit.

1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:56.000
Meghna...

1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:52.040
How could he think that I...

1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:55.920
People say stuff when they're angry.

1:03:57.800 --> 1:03:59.120
You could've controlled yourself.

1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:02.680
Was it my fault?

1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:07.320
Listen, I know it wasn't your fault.

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.880
Besides he is a veteran designer
and you are new to modeling.

1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.160
Does that mean he can say
whatever he wants?

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:18.400
So what if he is a reputed designer?

1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:20.320
I'm no average model either.

1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:34.800
Tell me one thing, Anisha.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:37.760
When is Shonali's contract up for renewal?

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:41.960
There is time yet.

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:45.640
Why?

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:47.000
Terminate her contract.

1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:55.440
But Sarin, we can't do that.

1:04:55.720 --> 1:04:56.920
Why not?

1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.400
Panache is my company
and I can do whatever I want.

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:05.640
I mean it hasn't expired as yet.

1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:07.640
Give Shonali full compensation.

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:10.400
In fact give her a little more
so that there are no complaints.

1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:19.960
But on what grounds?

1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:25.480
You'll think of something.
I am sure.

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:38.800
I warned you a couple of
times earlier, Shonali.

1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:42.400
Three official complaints!

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:44.920
After all professionalism matters.

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:53.000
Three complaints and I am out?

1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:55.160
It's not just that, Shonali.

1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:56.560
Your lifestyle,

1:05:56.680 --> 1:05:57.920
your boyfriends,

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:01.040
your addiction and
misbehavior at parties.

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:07.560
This was bound to happen someday.

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:16.600
The compensation is higher.

1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:18.600
If there is anything that

1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:21.120
you want to add to the termination
clause, go ahead.

1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:46.440
Who has replaced me?

1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:48.840
Meghna Mathur.

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:06.000
In no time my dreams
turned into reality

1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:07.960
and they reached the sky.

1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:13.520
My new image as a super
model everywhere

1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:15.760
gave me a new high.

1:08:17.920 --> 1:08:22.520
I felt like the whole world
was interested in no one but me.

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:29.200
What do I wear, eat, think...

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:31.960
The media wanted to know everything.

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:34.760
I too was lost in myself.

1:08:35.479 --> 1:08:38.560
I got so involved with the happiness...

1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:42.160
that what was next for me.

1:09:45.319 --> 1:09:47.560
-I didn't know that, its going to happen.
-Don't worry.

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:50.120
Neither did I.

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.600
It's this industry!

1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:56.960
You never know what's going to happen.

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:09.960
You're still new.

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:14.720
Everything feels good in the beginning.

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:17.320
The novelty eventually wears out.

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:22.520
I can see it in your eyes.

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.320
You will neither recognise
yourself nor anyone else.

1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:42.440
But I do recognise.

1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:46.760
Myself...

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:49.280
and others as well.

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:55.240
We'll see.

1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:39.840
If we wait any longer...

1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:42.560
I'll have to head to
office from here only.

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.440
No, that's it. You can stop here.

1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:51.200
I'll go from here.

1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:01.680
I know!

1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:11.040
I tried calling you all night.

1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:13.760
The phone was on silent
and in the bag.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:17.240
You knew I was with
Mr. Sarin at a party.

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:19.560
Listen, but you could have
sent me a text message.

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:27.840
I am a model too.

1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:32.600
Exactly! You're a model too,
so I thought you would understand.

1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:35.800
There were so many people at the party.

1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:41.520
And you forgot that
someone's waiting for you.

1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:46.120
You won't understand the pressures.

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.000
-Really? So make me understand.
-How do I?

1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:51.560
You aren't in that league.
You are still struggling.

1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:02.680
Meghna, I am really happy
that you are in the big league.

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.680
But have you thought about
the price you're paying for that?

1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:09.280
A lecture at four in the morning!

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:13.200
I am lecturing you because
not everybody can handle success.

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:15.600
Is that so?

1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:17.000
Then tell me...

1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:20.280
Why are those
who preach about success...

1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:22.520
only those who haven't tasted it yet?

1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:27.320
Because they don't run after it insanely.

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:33.040
And what if Mr. Sarin were promoting you?

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:35.880
Why would he?

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:37.680
He's promoting you, isn't he?

1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:40.040
Who knows what he is getting in return.

1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:59.280
I don't know why,
but I thought you were different.

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:02.520
I had also thought the same about you.

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:15.160
There is something special
It's close to me

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:21.480
There is an unusual feeling

1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:28.120
This closeness has a distance

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:34.160
There is loneliness in the air

1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:40.160
The intoxication and trust we had

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:46.600
May be it was love

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:53.000
Where there was blossom and no waiting

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:56.600
May be it was love

1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:04.880
May be it was love

1:16:40.320 --> 1:16:41.120
Move.

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:12.320
So many signatures, Anisha.
Is it necessary to read everything?

1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:18.400
It's your agency's
contract and I trust you.

1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:20.000
Where do I need to sign?

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.520
-What?
-And here... full signature.

1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:42.960
Right now?

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:49.760
-Sarin?
-Yes.

1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:51.160
Sign it later.

1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:30.120
I hope you like your new house.

1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:57.800
A beautiful home

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.360
A beautiful home

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:24.200
A beautiful home

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:27.040
I have got it

1:19:27.640 --> 1:19:30.840
The sign of my destination

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:34.440
Why should there be any complaint now?

1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:37.800
There is no doubt now

1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:44.480
A little fragrant
Intoxicating is my life

1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:52.080
A little fragrant
Intoxicating is my life

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:55.760
My beautiful house is here

1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:59.200
My people are my world

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.840
I have no time for myself

1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:06.480
I have no time for myself

1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:23.560
Don't try to stop me

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:27.160
Don't try to question me

1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:34.240
Slowly and softly
I have to lose my senses

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:38.480
There's France of such type that

1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:42.320
I have no patience anymore

1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:48.520
Slowly and softly
My heart is getting intoxicated

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:55.120
A little fragrant
Intoxicating is my life

1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:02.360
A little fragrant
Intoxicating is my life

1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:06.680
This is my beautiful home

1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:10.240
My people are my world

1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:17.080
I have no time for myself

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:33.520
A beautiful home

1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:38.040
You should often visit the Gurudwara.
It feels good.

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:39.520
-Gurpreet?
-Kuldeep?

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:41.480
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:43.840
-Greetings.
-Greetings, dear.

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:48.320
What about the photographs
that Mrs. Sethi sent?

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:51.440
No, aunty. I don't want to
get married right now.

1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:53.200
Don't want to get married?

1:21:54.480 --> 1:21:56.720
My daughter mentioned...

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:00.000
that these fashion designers
don't get married.

1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:01.360
Is it true?

1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:04.400
So are you also...

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:08.200
Aunty, these days people
say anything.

1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:11.440
How is your elder daughter, Dolly?

1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:13.600
The one who got married in London.

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:16.280
I heard she is divorced.

1:22:16.480 --> 1:22:18.080
And now she's living with you.

1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:20.200
Is it true?

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:23.680
Come on, let's go.

1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:29.800
You'll run out of answers
but their questions won't stop.

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:32.280
Mom...

1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:33.360
It's your life, your decision.

1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:34.960
Mom?

1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:42.800
I never thought I'd be the show
stopper for such a big show.

1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:45.800
-And today because of you...
-Enough now.

1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:48.040
Now don't get into your
teenage drama queen mode.

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:50.000
You very well know that you can do it.

1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:51.040
Or else, you wouldn't have agreed.

1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:58.360
I agreed because
I can never say no to you.

1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:57.200
-Here you are.
-Yes.

1:24:57.640 --> 1:24:59.560
So, what did you ask from God?

1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:01.760
I wasn't here to ask.
I came to thank Him.

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:07.360
Janet, yesterday, backstage
you told me something.

1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:10.760
What?

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:13.920
That you can never say no to me.

1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:48.200
Listen, I don't know
whether it's right or wrong.

1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:50.560
But I do know that...

1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:52.200
if anyone can understand me...

1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:54.840
it's only you.

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.640
What about your boyfriend?

1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:05.080
I have spoken to him.

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:09.720
When you can't come
out with the truth

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.360
it's time to live a lie.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:17.560
There are a lot of people
who live like us.

1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.120
So shall we.

1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:23.600
And as they say...

1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:27.440
it is difficult to find
a good friend in a husband.

1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:31.440
But you will surely find
a good husband in a good friend.

1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:47.920
You know I can never say no to you.

1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:06.160
Let's go.

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:21.240
Don't worry. They're saying good things.

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.160
Abhi is taking good
care of you, isn't he?

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.240
After all, you are
so important to Panache.

1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:10.200
It's Rahul's wedding today...

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.760
and I'm very happy.

1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:08.040
Vinay, you will get any look you want.
But please call your model.

1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:12.920
-Does anyone want to shoot or not?
-Yes, of course.

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:15.480
-Vinay.
-Yes.

1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:18.440
I thought of holding
the drape like this.

1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:22.200
I know you are very particular
about your drapes.

1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:25.680
If you don't like it we can change it.

1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:39.120
Come on, Vinay. Let's hurry up.

1:29:39.400 --> 1:29:41.080
It's been two hours and
we haven't taken a single shot.

1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:45.600
Why are you getting
so hyper, Kartik?

1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:48.120
Anyway, what do you have to do?

1:29:48.840 --> 1:29:51.040
Except change the background colours.

1:30:31.520 --> 1:30:32.560
Drink this.

1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:39.960
Are you joking?

1:30:45.360 --> 1:30:46.160
Please, pal.

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:16.000
You insult me in front of your friends
and then say you were joking.

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:19.640
Who funds your expenses?
Who pays all your bills?

1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:20.880
Do your friends know about this?

1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:22.640
Have you told them or should I?

1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:27.320
You don't do me any favour
by funding my expenses.

1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:29.600
Who gets you your dope?

1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:31.160
I do.

1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:33.280
Who handles your craziness?

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:34.960
I do!

1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:30.640
I won't wear such tacky earrings.

1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:33.000
Meghna, everyone has the same look.

1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:35.080
All the models are wearing
the same earrings.

1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.720
I have been tantalizing for you

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:30.920
In this air and atmosphere

1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:37.920
You've tormented me with your promise

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:45.520
God is looking at this atmosphere

1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:42.240
I'm not in a frame of mind to comment.

1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:47.920
The media should
show some restraint.

1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:58.480
There is no need to hype it
and create an issue of it.

1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:01.640
Down with fashion shows!
Don't ruin our culture!

1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:03.640
As far as Vinay Khosla's
show is concerned...

1:36:03.920 --> 1:36:07.440
whether this was an
accident or publicity stunt...

1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:09.040
only Shonali can confirm.

1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:12.160
You have just seen what
Meghna Mathur had to say.

1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:13.600
She herself is a model
the same Meghna Mathur,

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.920
who is the brand
ambassador of Panache.

1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.320
Could this be a personal conflict?
Or anything else?

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:20.800
Let's see again, what
Meghna Mathur has to say

1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:24.120
about her rival Shonali Gujral.

1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:27.640
Whether this was an accident or publicity
stunt, only Shonali can confirm.

1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:31.080
Whether this was an accident or publicity
stunt, only Shonali can confirm.

1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:34.440
Whether this was an accident or publicity
stunt, only Shonali can confirm.

1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:42.200
Did you see the story about Shonali on TV?

1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:44.520
She's in rehab.

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:47.040
Don't know for how long she
will have to stay there.

1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:54.640
Janet, have you given it a thought?

1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:01.360
To adopt a child
considering our situation?

1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:05.920
Yes, Rahul.
It's a huge responsibility.

1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:14.120
How is Ashish doing?

1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:20.560
He's gone to Chennai.

1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:22.280
He's doing a show with Manish.

1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:29.680
Your drink.

1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:37.960
Why can't you come with me
on this three city tour?

1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.440
I mean, it is a Panache event.

1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:49.880
And what sort of craziness is this?

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:55.600
There's something I want to tell you.

1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:57.760
Go on.

1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:17.920
And what if I tell you...

1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:21.040
that I want to keep the baby.

1:39:27.920 --> 1:39:28.960
I don't have a problem.

1:39:30.160 --> 1:39:31.920
But Anisha might have a problem.

1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:34.560
You have signed a contract.

1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:42.400
Abhi, at times you are really funny.

1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:44.200
I was just kidding.

1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:47.360
You took it seriously.

1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:14.440
Yes, my love.
I'm on my way home.

1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:17.120
No, I dined with the client.

1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:20.200
Did the children sleep?

1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:33.440
We will get twenty percent
of your earnings.

1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.720
You can't do any endorsement
or make an appearance...

1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:45.240
without our permission.

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:53.840
Officially you can
neither get married...

1:40:55.160 --> 1:40:57.120
nor get pregnant.

1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:12.200
Whom are you calling?

1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:14.720
Sarin?

1:41:17.800 --> 1:41:20.360
Sarin put in these clauses in
the contract himself.

1:41:55.800 --> 1:42:01.000
I went back to being a middle
class girl for a while.

1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:26.160
Whose pregnancy do you
want to get terminated?

1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:27.280
Mine.

1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:06.880
Madam, you are driving
without the seat belt.

1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:13.360
Listen, I don't have much time, so...

1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:14.720
Alright. Take the car aside.

1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:22.120
Surekha, take the test.

1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:26.200
Who knows how many people
have put it in their mouth.

1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:27.320
Listen, madam.

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:30.280
It doesn't matter whether you are
a model, an actor or anybody else.

1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:33.720
Surekha, take the test.

1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:52.360
Our daughter has made us proud.

1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:55.960
Why are you crying?

1:44:56.200 --> 1:44:59.920
Look, your daughter is now a super model.

1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:06.720
Now our neighbours will come
with flowers, to a proud mother.

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:13.480
Meghna, your reckless behaviour is
not only damaging your reputation...

1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:15.440
but Panache's too.

1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:17.320
I know you are upset.

1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:21.320
But learn to keep your personal life
apart from your professional life.

1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:30.240
Tell me something, Abhi.

1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:32.920
What about our relationship?

1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:36.800
Is it personal or professional?

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:24.200
I am telling you, they don't
want to sell the food there.

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:05.720
I think you have taken
my words too seriously.

1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.280
You have become so professional

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:09.760
that you are uneasy greeting me.

1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:23.760
Mrs. Sarin.

1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:28.280
I saw all that drama on television.

1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:35.640
Didn't you tell her?

1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:40.680
I was in a clinic.

1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:49.880
Abhi will give you the details.

1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:54.000
After all he paid the bill.

1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:05.200
Oh! She got offended.

1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:18.560
I'm telling you again Meghna,
it's still not too late.

1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:21.120
Avantika is very upset.

1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:26.560
Just meet her once and apologise.

1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:28.760
If she forgives you,
everything will be sorted.

1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:29.840
I should apologise to her?

1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:35.680
Who is she, Anisha?

1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:41.680
I don't need her.

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:45.400
Of course, you need her, Meghna.

1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:48.600
You're in this position due to Panache.

1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:50.560
All the brands are signing you.

1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:02.920
I don't need Panache,
Panache needs me. Okay?

1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:09.840
Anything else?

1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:50.120
I just read the paper.

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:53.960
This had to happen.

1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:55.400
I told you so.

1:49:57.720 --> 1:49:59.520
Gauri Anand is from your agency.

1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:02.360
That means you knew I was
going to be replaced!

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:11.720
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:16.400
When we replaced Shonali...

1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:18.800
you didn't ask me this.

1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:36.840
The sound of a shattered
dream never hurts

1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:38.840
as much as it's lasting echo.

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.640
My career started falling
like a pack of cards

1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:44.680
and I stood there,
like a mere spectator.

1:50:45.320 --> 1:50:47.480
Everything changed.
Home, relationships...

1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:48.960
and along with them I changed too.

1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:52.400
Commitments, sincerity, professionalism...

1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:55.480
I ran away from all of them

1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:59.080
and reached a place so loud...

1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:02.160
that I couldn't even hear myself.

1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:07.800
What I was doing, why I was doing it...
I had no clue at all.

1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:12.960
Shonali was right,
I couldn't even recognize myself.

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.000
You've had a lot to drink.

1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:26.920
You're saying this, Janet!

1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:31.920
Look, I don't know how to lecture.

1:51:32.280 --> 1:51:35.080
But I can say that
you're ruining yourself.

1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:39.800
You don't know how to lecture,
so please don't try.

1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:45.080
Meghna, everyone I meet is
talking about your arrogance.

1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:51.480
It's important to have an
attitude to be successful.

1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:56.960
Is that necessary too?

1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:01.640
Listen, if you continue to behave like
this no one will want to work with you.

1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:14.200
What do you know
about professionalism?

1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:18.920
You don't become a model by doing
a couple of small assignments.

1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:25.920
Listen, I know I didn't make it big.

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:29.400
But I have spent more
time in this industry.

1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:34.680
I know why your reputation
is getting ruined.

1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:36.920
That's why I'm telling you.

1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:39.280
Straighten up before everything crumbles.

1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:44.080
Straighten up?

1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:46.680
How?

1:52:47.880 --> 1:52:50.280
Should I beg Sarin or Anisha?

1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:54.360
I know what I can do.

1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.160
I should marry a rich
gay designer like you.

1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:29.360
Hi, babes. Where are you?

1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:34.000
Yes, I'll be there.

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:41.320
Charisma

1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:49.960
Charisma

1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.160
It's the charisma of the bodies

1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:58.520
Charisma also brings wealth

1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:00.640
Charisma also gives us a reason

1:54:04.880 --> 1:54:08.800
Charisma feels adorable

1:54:08.880 --> 1:54:16.840
It's enjoyment
It's intoxication

1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:26.360
Charisma
It flows like fire and walks in style

1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:31.880
It sparks a fire in the hearts

1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:36.240
This is the charisma of fashion

1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:40.400
This is the charisma of fashion

1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.440
This is the charisma of fashion

1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:48.640
This is the charisma of fashion

1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:26.160
It has distracted everyone
Its illusion is unique

1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:30.720
No one escape from this charisma

1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:34.440
It also shows you the sky and
Brings you down on the Earth

1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:36.560
It has made us do everything for it

1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:38.480
This charisma

1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:41.960
It flows like fire

1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:45.040
It walks in style

1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:51.080
It sparks a fire in the hearts

1:55:51.520 --> 1:55:55.400
This is the charisma of fashion

1:55:55.880 --> 1:55:59.840
This is the charisma of fashion

1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:04.200
This is the charisma of fashion

1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:08.240
This is the charisma of fashion

2:00:35.760 --> 2:00:36.800
Meghna...

2:00:42.680 --> 2:00:43.680
Dear...

2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.240
We become totally isolated

2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:05.840
when we lose our own company.

2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:09.000
I came back home to Chandigarh...

2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:12.040
but I could never be myself.

2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:14.760
Leaving all my relationships behind

2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:17.600
I descended into my inner darkness.

2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:21.800
I neither felt happy nor sad.

2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:29.080
The psychiatrist advised...

2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:32.040
that nothing is possible until

2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:37.840
I rediscover myself and
my self-confidence.

2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.400
But as easy as it is to lose oneself...

2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:45.560
it is even more difficult
to forgive...

2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:48.440
and find oneself again.

2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:52.120
Have you heard anything about Shonali?

2:01:53.680 --> 2:01:55.560
I heard that she's in some rehab.

2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:58.000
No one knows where exactly.

2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:09.480
Who is your show stopper
for the Delhi show?

2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:13.880
I heard that just like Vinay Khosla,
you too have roped in a film star.

2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:18.880
But if there was a model

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:21.080
for a show stopper for
this show, that's best.

2:03:11.040 --> 2:03:12.080
Meghna.

2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:18.000
Dear...

2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:21.760
The one who loses...

2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:24.160
isn't the one who falls.

2:03:25.920 --> 2:03:27.160
But a failure is one...

2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:29.680
who still doesn't rise to the occasion.

2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:33.920
My daughter is not a loser.

2:03:36.840 --> 2:03:37.920
I'm sorry, my dear.

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:43.280
It was my fault.

2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:48.240
That I didn't trust my daughter's dream...

2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:51.720
-and how high it could take her.
-Papa...

2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:56.880
I had trust in my daughter...

2:03:57.320 --> 2:03:58.480
and I still do.

2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:05.720
Meghna, go ahead and
pursue your dream again.

2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:08.520
Yes, my dear.

2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:15.480
Go back, my dear.

2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:24.080
Yes, dear.

2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:28.680
Go back, my dear.

2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:02.200
I thought I'd come and apologise.

2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:07.200
But I can't.

2:05:22.760 --> 2:05:25.600
But when I decided to come back...

2:05:27.200 --> 2:05:29.200
I couldn't think of anyone else but you.

2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:35.160
So, I came right here.

2:05:41.360 --> 2:05:42.720
Didn't I do the right thing, Janet?

2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:09.920
You may borrow clothes for
a function, but do return them.

2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:49.880
She's sent it to everyone.

2:06:57.280 --> 2:06:59.600
You know, she always
compared herself to Shonali.

2:07:00.760 --> 2:07:02.840
Mark my words, someday
she will lose it just like Shonali.

2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:20.360
You went through a lot in your life.

2:08:24.280 --> 2:08:25.880
But the good thing is
that you have come back.

2:08:40.680 --> 2:08:42.600
I know I've hurt you a lot.

2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:50.600
I'm really happy for you that
today you're in the big league.

2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:10.440
We got engaged last month.

2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:20.080
-No.
-Please stay for a while.

2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:21.560
Some other time.

2:09:56.080 --> 2:09:59.920
It is said that the people you meet
on your way up to success...

2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:03.840
you encounter them again
on your way down.

2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:08.640
It felt really weird.

2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:15.280
The relations I left behind in
arrogance of my success...

2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:20.200
have left me and gone way ahead in life.

2:10:21.400 --> 2:10:22.640
Everything had changed.

2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:27.800
But thank God.
Some relationships in life...

2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:31.400
don't require an
invitation for acceptance.

2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:52.840
For giving me this show.

2:10:54.920 --> 2:10:56.680
I know that you didn't have to do it.

2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:01.720
And everyone must have
advised you not to.

2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:05.480
No one knows you like I do.

2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:09.280
Look, if I could have my way,
you would be my show stopper.

2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:19.720
The fact that I'm even in
your show, means a lot.

2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:27.280
After all, it is my first show
on comeback and...

2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:05.080
Daisy, why isn't the dress ironed yet?

2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.480
-Meghna...
-Hi.

2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:15.720
Meghna, are you okay?

2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:16.800
Yes, of course.

2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:28.800
I froze on the head ramp.

2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:34.160
It happens sometimes, Meghna.

2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:37.320
It doesn't happen, Rahul.

2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:49.280
You were nervous then, that's all.

2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:51.800
I mean, you walked
the ramp after a year.

2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:55.440
Meghna just think!
How will your dad feel?

2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:09.480
You know how this industry works.

2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:13.040
There is no room for weakness.

2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:31.640
Yes, that's her.

2:16:31.960 --> 2:16:33.360
What has she done to her?

2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:39.040
-Madam, do you know anybody here?
-Shut up! Go away!

2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:41.879
Madam, please tell us.
Do you know anyone here?

2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:53.600
People say that she has
been here for the last two days

2:16:53.680 --> 2:16:55.280
and isn't talking to anyone.

2:16:55.559 --> 2:16:57.480
Shonali Gujral's distressing story...

2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:01.160
highlights another truth
of the fashion industry.

2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:04.959
It is evident that the profession
isn't as glamorous as it seems.

2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:09.200
It is said that she ran away from rehab.

2:17:21.719 --> 2:17:22.920
Listen, Inspector...

2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:24.440
instead of roaming
on the streets...

2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:27.080
instead of making a mockery
in front of the media...

2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:29.080
it is better that
we take her along.

2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:31.480
Our NGO will
take good care of her.

2:17:31.879 --> 2:17:33.120
Madam, it's a procedure.

2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:35.040
Until her family members don't come...

2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:36.799
and don't take her along...

2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:38.840
or she doesn't say anything...

2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:40.920
we can't let you take her.

2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:51.120
Madam, do you know her?

2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:54.520
Yes, I do.

2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:09.240
Meghna, it's a huge responsibility.

2:18:09.879 --> 2:18:11.080
You yourself are struggling.

2:18:11.680 --> 2:18:13.799
Can you afford to look
after her as well?

2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:20.719
I haven't thought about it, Janet.

2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:24.360
All I know is...

2:18:26.160 --> 2:18:27.440
I'm not doing it for Shonali...

2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:30.080
but for myself.

2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:58.799
After bringing Shonali
home I realized

2:18:58.879 --> 2:19:02.040
that our lives were quite similar.

2:19:03.680 --> 2:19:05.520
Both of us had lost ourselves.

2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:09.080
The happiness I achieved in helping...

2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:11.520
Shonali come back to a normal life...

2:19:11.879 --> 2:19:15.559
was more important than the happiness
of professional success.

2:19:16.799 --> 2:19:23.440
As she got better, I regained
the self confidence I had lost.

2:20:00.840 --> 2:20:02.440
In fact everything was
finalized yesterday.

2:20:06.720 --> 2:20:07.720
Who is the show stopper?

2:20:08.160 --> 2:20:09.360
Like Vinay Khosla's...

2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:17.240
Ms. Meghna Mathur.

2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:31.520
After what happened
at Rohit's show...

2:20:34.280 --> 2:20:37.680
Meghna, we've given
this a lot of thought.

2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:45.440
I know you'll are doing this for me.

2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:48.760
And I appreciate it. I really do.
I am really grateful, but...

2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:03.320
Why don't you want to do the show?

2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:09.480
You do know how important
this show is for you, don't you?

2:21:10.200 --> 2:21:11.400
Come on, Shonali.

2:21:12.600 --> 2:21:14.600
You do know what happened
during Rohit's show and...

2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:19.840
This show is very
important for Rahul.

2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:30.560
Meghna, you aren't
worried for Rahul...

2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:33.040
but you're afraid of failing again.

2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:37.960
Rahul has so much confidence in you.

2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:40.520
Isn't it your turn...

2:21:41.520 --> 2:21:43.800
to prove him right?

2:21:55.640 --> 2:21:57.680
We have lost a lot here, Meghna.

2:22:03.800 --> 2:22:08.080
But if this show helps
you make a comeback...

2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:32.080
I have never interfered
in your decisions, Rahul.

2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:33.720
So why do it now?

2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:37.800
To make Meghna the show stopper
for such an important show!

2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:41.880
And you know
what she did at Rohit's show.

2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:52.360
People from the Paris Fashion
Week are coming to see the finale.

2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:56.160
If there is any problem in this show
then Paris is out of the question.

2:23:05.320 --> 2:23:06.360
Nothing of that sort will happen.

2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:09.800
But is it necessary to take
such a big risk for this show?

2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:12.120
There are other shows as well.
Give her a chance there.

2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:14.240
No, Abhijeet. It'll be too late then.

2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:47.760
The Kimaya Fashion Week
has begun with a controversy.

2:23:48.320 --> 2:23:50.480
Bollywood's ace
designer Vinay Khosla...

2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:55.040
has accused upcoming designer
Zulfi Khan with stealing his designs.

2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:00.680
I had designed them for a film,
which he has stolen from there.

2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:02.960
I can show you the DVD.

2:24:14.840 --> 2:24:15.640
Yes.

2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:18.960
Rohit's driver will come
to pick you up from the airport.

2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:21.600
-Come directly to the venue.
-Okay. Did you have dinner?

2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:23.600
No, mom. I have just returned
from a fitting session.

2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:26.120
Okay, dear. Take care of yourself.

2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:27.160
We will be there.

2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:39.520
Shonali!

2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:50.200
Shonali?

2:24:56.560 --> 2:24:57.560
Shonali!

2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:12.640
Shonali...

2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:34.640
Janet, Shonali isn't at home.

2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:36.440
The house is a mess.
I don't know what to do!

2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:39.520
-What is it?
-We'll be there soon.

2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:49.720
Who are these people?

2:26:01.200 --> 2:26:02.200
Did she come here?

2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:04.160
Why would she come here?

2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:08.040
She hasn't paid me 5,000 rupees
for the stuff as yet.

2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:09.800
She's probably lying
around on the streets.

2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:20.600
What did he say?

2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:22.040
Shinde, pay attention.

2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:24.680
If you get any information,
call immediately.

2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:27.000
Look, don't panic.

2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:30.200
We've sent out a search party.

2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:32.160
We'll try our best.

2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:34.280
We have your number.

2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:38.760
If we get any information about Shonali

2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:40.160
we will inform you.

2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:42.080
-But...
-Relax.

2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:44.720
Sir, please try your best.

2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:20.000
Don't worry.
We'll find Shonali.

2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:21.680
We've informed the police.

2:27:22.200 --> 2:27:23.280
Everything will be alright.

2:28:21.800 --> 2:28:23.000
Alicia.

2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:39.520
I have been tantalizing you

2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:42.800
In this air and atmosphere

2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:46.280
You've tormented me with your promise

2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:49.760
God is looking at this atmosphere

2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:22.880
I shall give up my life

2:29:24.520 --> 2:29:27.400
Ask the inspector to call Meghna Mathur.

2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:30.120
I shall give up my life

2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:31.000
Okay, thank you.

2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:36.560
I shall give up my life

2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:43.680
I shall die for your love

2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:50.680
It's like a letter with drenched dreams

2:29:54.720 --> 2:29:56.480
It's like an addiction of drenched love

2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:01.160
I shall give up my life

2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:03.480
I shall give up my life

2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:10.560
I shall die for your love

2:30:13.080 --> 2:30:15.080
I have been tantalizing for you

2:30:15.400 --> 2:30:18.280
In this air and atmosphere

2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:21.800
You've tormented me with your promise

2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:25.080
God is looking at this atmosphere

2:30:30.360 --> 2:30:32.160
-Hello, Miss Meghna.
-Yes.

2:30:32.360 --> 2:30:34.680
This is Inspector Gighe from
Bandra police station.

2:30:36.200 --> 2:30:37.400
There's a bad news.

2:30:37.640 --> 2:30:40.120
We've found Shonali Gujral's body
in Khar East.

2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:45.200
We suspect that the cause of
death could be drug overdose.

2:30:46.280 --> 2:30:51.200
Please come to Bhabha Hospital
and claim the body.

2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:43.600
Meghna!

2:31:51.920 --> 2:31:53.240
Meghna!

2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:48.520
When we dream, nobody tells
us what we have to

2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:51.000
give up to achieve them.

2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:57.480
I lost Shonali in the same
moment I achieved success.

2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:00.880
I was pained by her loss.

2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:07.000
But I had the feeling that
she gave me a reason to dream.

2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:21.360
Even after everything
I went through...

2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:24.840
life provided me another opportunity.

2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:27.640
To find myself again.
