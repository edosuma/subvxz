about the bogus Armenian threat.

44:55.324 --> 44:57.259
He thought that Shane
was trying to hurt him

44:57.260 --> 44:58.927
by scaring you
and your daughter.

44:58.928 --> 45:00.695
What Armenian threat?

45:00.696 --> 45:04.599
Shane was acting out on some tip
from some banger in County.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.636
I guess one of us
is being lied to.

45:09.072 --> 45:13.342
Listen, Vic's had this ex-cop
watching us all day long, okay?

45:13.343 --> 45:16.545
I don't know what's going on--
I do.

45:16.546 --> 45:19.481
And it's hurting
both our families.

45:19.482 --> 45:21.617
If our husbands won't stay away
from each other,

45:21.618 --> 45:24.486
then maybe we need
to step in so that--

45:24.487 --> 45:27.289
So that somebody
doesn't get hurt.

45:33.429 --> 45:35.130
Cassidy?

45:39.302 --> 45:41.270
Zadofian's prelim
crime-scene report.

45:41.271 --> 45:43.071
Holy shit.

45:43.072 --> 45:44.973
His shoes were attached
when I left him.

45:44.974 --> 45:47.176
Guess who the first detective
on the scene was.

45:47.177 --> 45:50.345
I know. Shane.

45:50.346 --> 45:52.380
[SIGHS]

45:52.381 --> 45:55.884
Rezian must have sent him
looking for Zadofian.

45:55.885 --> 45:58.887
The feet were some kind of
message to Diro.

45:58.888 --> 46:00.956
There he is.

46:00.957 --> 46:03.525
Shane is neck-deep
in Armenian shit.

46:05.362 --> 46:09.231
Listen, we gotta keep him close,
make him feel safe.

46:09.232 --> 46:11.300
Just like old times.

46:11.301 --> 46:14.436
Soon as we get this situation
under control.

46:17.606 --> 46:21.209
What you did for me today,
I'll never forget.

46:22.778 --> 46:25.347
I thought pulling the trigger
would be the hard part, but--

46:25.348 --> 46:26.781
Don't you ever

46:26.782 --> 46:30.051
get sucked into that black hole
that got Shane.

46:34.523 --> 46:37.926
You got any idea
how Zadofian got that pedicure?

46:39.329 --> 46:41.964
Was like that
when I got on the scene.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.566
Why?
It's just,

46:44.567 --> 46:48.503
he had both his feet
when we got done talking to him.

46:52.375 --> 46:54.610
Look, Rezian wanted me
to find Zadofian

46:54.611 --> 46:56.344
before the cops did.

46:56.345 --> 46:59.248
Turn him over to his guys.

46:59.249 --> 47:01.783
I chopped off the feet

47:01.784 --> 47:04.486
to make it look
like Diro's handiwork.

47:04.487 --> 47:06.088
No idea who shot him.

47:06.089 --> 47:07.589
You?

47:09.225 --> 47:12.060
Probably was Diro.

47:13.129 --> 47:14.229
Right.

47:15.632 --> 47:18.433
Well, either way,
it helped sell the story.

47:18.434 --> 47:19.601
Told Rezian

47:19.602 --> 47:22.905
that Diro's made some
new greasy friends.

47:22.906 --> 47:24.339
Did like you said.

47:24.340 --> 47:26.809
Convinced him that the Mexicans
were his biggest threat.

47:26.810 --> 47:29.411
Good, I got the Mexicans
thinking

47:29.412 --> 47:33.081
that the Armenians are making
a power play for the barrio.

47:33.082 --> 47:35.150
And we help
both sides win.

47:36.419 --> 47:39.120
Could get
real bloody real fast.

47:39.121 --> 47:42.690
The sooner they bleed out,
the sooner my family's safe.

47:44.961 --> 47:47.596
So...

47:47.597 --> 47:49.864
What now?

47:49.865 --> 47:51.900
We just sit back,

47:53.669 --> 47:56.338
and watch the gang war.

48:04.280 --> 48:06.281
