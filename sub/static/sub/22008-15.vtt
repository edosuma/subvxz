WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:05.711
Need a warm-up, hon?

00:05.881 --> 00:07.622
No, thanks. Just the check.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.836
Be right... Right back.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.801
Hey, you okay?

00:19.978 --> 00:23.562
- Hey, Phoebe? What's the matter?
- I don't know what's wrong.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.019
I feel dizzy, like I can't...

00:26.193 --> 00:28.810
- You're burning up.
- Is there a doctor here?!

00:28.987 --> 00:30.853
Somebody, call an ambulance!

00:31.031 --> 00:33.944
My head, that ringing. Please.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.949
I can't. Something's wrong.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.245
She seems to be having
a viral reaction.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.531
Ambulance is on its way.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.922
We have to call the CDC right now.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.311
- You can't keep me here.
- We both feel fine.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.354
I got another.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.320
Can somebody explain what's going on?

01:13.490 --> 01:16.483
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Dr. Marcus Joffe.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.026
I'm a CDC investigator.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.911
This facility is being placed
under quarantine.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.324
We need to identify
who needs immediate care.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.150
I took the liberty.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.489
Is this latex or memory foam?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.027
<i>He broke into my house.</i>

02:01.204 --> 02:04.242
I wake up in the night,
the man's sitting on my bed.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.580
- Reddington has a flair for the dramatic.
- He threatened to kill me.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.996
If you divulge his relationship
with the FBI. So don't.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.211
We told you about this to gain your trust.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.626
Reddington wants you
to help find my husband's killer.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.214
That's what he said.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.505
He seemed more interested
in my mattress.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.389
You can draw out the killer?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.927
- What do you call him, Damascus?
- We don't know his real name.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.017
He's a cop protecting drug dealers
with the Nash Syndicate.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.683
I'm part of a task force trying
to bring them down.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.477
Every time we get a lead,
Damascus tips them off.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.773
Which means whoever killed Tom
has a line in on his task force.

02:37.949 --> 02:41.317
My next meeting, I'll let it be known
that we have a snitch of our own.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.696
Someone inside the syndicate
who can ID Damascus.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.873
Bobby Navarro, a former dealer
from the syndicate who's gone missing.

02:51.046 --> 02:54.630
We'll tell them when I'll meet Navarro
and that he'll ID Damascus.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.134
Whoever shows up to stop that
will either be Damascus...

02:58.303 --> 03:00.465
...or someone that can lead us to him.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.676
Detective Singleton,
I'm sure you agree...

03:02.849 --> 03:05.136
...a dirty cop is
a good cop's worst enemy.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.098
Still, it's hard to go after one of our own.
And dangerous.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.480
I appreciate your determination.
Keen, reach out to Reddington.

03:11.650 --> 03:15.815
Please implore him that he should
stay off the detective's mattress.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.069
I'm sorry. I'm out.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.404
Yes. Of jail. Because of me.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.662
And in exchange for said freedom,
you owe me one genuine...

03:26.832 --> 03:28.664
...bona fide, Earl Fagen...

03:28.834 --> 03:32.202
...electrical-wires-somehow-
got-crossed inferno.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.247
- Then you're out.
- No. Then I'm in.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.044
I mean, then I'm back in.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.837
- You're waving coke in front of an addict.
- Take a snort.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.847
This isn't a negotiation.
It's an assignment.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.508
I have a business
that's become a liability.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.348
I need you to burn it down.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.889
Critter Cabin, we're in the book.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.819
- There you are. I have a case.
- And I have a request:

03:57.988 --> 04:00.526
Take it easy on Singleton.
He's on our side.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.316
For now. Because he's afraid not to be.

04:03.702 --> 04:07.662
I find a good bedside chat
to be effective and exhilarating.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.450
He and I have a plan.
If it works out, it'll ID Tom's killer.

04:11.626 --> 04:15.495
Then what? If it turns out to be a cop,
what are you gonna do?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.380
Let the system close ranks
around one of its own?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.666
Let him lawyer up, stand trial?

04:20.844 --> 04:23.587
Juries acquit cops
even when they have video...

04:23.764 --> 04:26.302
...showing those cops
shooting innocent victims.

04:26.475 --> 04:30.139
You think a jury will take
your word over his? Your memory?

04:30.312 --> 04:33.771
The memory of someone who suffered
such significant brain trauma...

04:33.940 --> 04:37.024
- ...she was in a coma for 10 months.
- Why are you telling me this?

04:37.194 --> 04:40.153
Because we both know
this doesn't end in a courtroom.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.530
It ends on the street.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.654
I want you to be prepared for that.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.281
- About this case...
- I'm only interested in Tom's murder.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.666
Unfortunately, this is an urgent one.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.044
There's been an acute viral outbreak
in New York City.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.831
I'm afraid it was not a natural occurrence.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.091
Nine months ago,
Reddington was approached...

05:02.260 --> 05:05.094
...by Jumbal Mazi Okoro,
South African black-market trader...

05:05.263 --> 05:08.222
...who was looking to secure
a rare viral agent for his client.

05:08.391 --> 05:13.682
Okoro was requesting a pathogen
with maximum contagion capabilities.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.973
Reddington never facilitated the trade,
citing ethical issues.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.734
- Go figure.
- But based on this morning's incident...

05:20.904 --> 05:25.490
...Reddington believes this client may be
responsible for the attacks in NY.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.116
Agent Mojtabai.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.695
- Is something funny?
- What?

05:31.039 --> 05:36.285
No, sorry, I was just watching Agent Keen.
It's good to have you back.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.420
- Even if it's on restricted duty.
- Thanks, Aram.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.955
What's the connection?

05:41.132 --> 05:44.000
Okoro was looking to obtain
the same kind of pathogen.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.012
A highly-concentrated, purified form
of organic chemicals.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.547
Can Reddington ID the client?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.341
No, and neither can Okoro,
who was killed in November.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.978
Based on this morning's incident,
Reddington thinks his would-be client...

05:56.147 --> 05:59.606
- ...may be active on U.S. soil.
- I'll notify HHS and Homeland.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.938
Ressler, Navabi,
coordinate with the troops...

06:02.112 --> 06:04.775
...and see if the CDC's
uncovered anything.

06:05.907 --> 06:10.777
Lab confirmed it's a viral pathogen,
likely airborne and replicating quickly.

06:10.954 --> 06:14.288
When we arrived,
we had 26 confirmed cases.

06:14.457 --> 06:18.326
Customers, first responders.
In six hours that number's tripled.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.961
- What about your quarantine?
- Three square blocks.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.999
N.Y.P.D. has another 12 in lockdown.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.794
- How do you know it's a targeted attack?
- Confidential source.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.803
Think this may be a designer virus?

06:29.973 --> 06:34.593
All I know is what my people told you
on the phone. About the woman.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.188
Here. With the notebook.

06:39.357 --> 06:43.442
She somehow managed to slip out
before we could ID the infected.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.696
Could be a mistake,
but whoever she is, she's not here now.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.151
Can you roll that back?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.531
It's an inhaler.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.162
We suspect it may contain...

06:55.332 --> 06:59.167
- ...some kind of anti-viral agent.
- Looks like we have a suspect.

06:59.711 --> 07:03.796
<i>Aram, I'm gonna send you some CCTV
images. We need an ID right away.</i>

07:03.965 --> 07:06.958
<i>Tell your confidential source
if he knows anything else...</i>

07:07.135 --> 07:09.001
<i>...he needs to tell us.</i>

07:09.179 --> 07:12.138
<i>We'll have fatalities on our hands
within the hour.</i>

07:20.315 --> 07:23.433
Got word of N.Y.P.D. responding
to a call at New York General.

07:23.610 --> 07:27.775
- Where they're treating the infected?
- Yes. But there may be another outbreak.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.780
They found a biological device.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.695
Doesn't make sense. Why would she try
to infect them twice? They're already sick.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.788
You won't believe this. I don't think
we're looking at another virus.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.668
Why, what is it?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.626
It's the cure.

07:57.060 --> 08:00.053
Sixteen people are in serious condition.
Seven are critical.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.267
Why aren't they being given
the antidote?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.978
- The CDC wants to test it.
- How about on the victims?

08:05.151 --> 08:07.518
What could happen?
They're dying anyway.

08:07.696 --> 08:11.235
We've confirmed it's her, the woman
who caused the infection.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.367
Why would she infect people
only to provide them with the cure?

08:14.536 --> 08:16.277
Okay, hang on. I got an ID.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.743
Here we go.
Captain Patricia Sue Edwards.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.830
She's a biochemist, formerly with
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute...

08:24.004 --> 08:27.088
<i>- ...of Infectious Disease.
- USAMRIID. The germ-warfare guys.</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:31.171
<i>Married to Lieutenant Commander
Dennis Edwards, Navy SEAL.</i>

08:31.344 --> 08:34.928
- All in, all the time. Best of the best.
- Put a pin in that...

08:35.097 --> 08:37.635
...because in March 2017...

08:37.808 --> 08:40.847
...Lieutenant Commander Edwards
was stationed in Manbij, Syria...

08:41.020 --> 08:44.685
<i>...tasked with securing the area
to facilitate the liberation of Raqqa.</i>

08:44.858 --> 08:48.226
His record had been exemplary
up until another SEAL...

08:48.403 --> 08:51.146
...caught him stealing
a truck full of confiscated opium.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.941
- Was he court-martialed?
- Killed. By the SEAL who caught him.

08:55.118 --> 08:58.031
And judge advocate ruled
that it was self-defense.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.615
Did they investigate the wife?

08:59.789 --> 09:02.247
Yeah, but nothing conclusive.
But she was stripped...

09:02.417 --> 09:05.956
<i>...of her security clearance
at USAMRIID before resigning.</i>

09:06.129 --> 09:10.339
Which means she lost access
to the chemical and biological weapons.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.215
She's gotten over that hurdle.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.471
There was a story in the news today.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.641
About an outbreak.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.778
I think you'll like it.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.908
Red, I told you from day one,
Heddie's no good.

09:42.082 --> 09:46.122
She knows how to cook the books,
but she's a little nutty, excitable.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.162
She's taken a powder,
we're about to be audited, so what?

09:49.339 --> 09:52.548
Now you got this... This... This...
This guy? To what?

09:52.717 --> 09:55.960
To light a match and boom,
there goes this deal we got going.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.845
As you well know,
Heddie did not take a powder.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.884
She's lying in her bed right now,
sneezing and wheezing...

10:03.061 --> 10:04.643
...swollen up like a puffer fish.

10:04.813 --> 10:08.727
I'm afraid all the dogs and cats
finally got the best of her.

10:08.900 --> 10:13.110
Be that as it may, mistakes are mistakes.
And she's out of her depth.

10:13.279 --> 10:17.114
And now, with the new tax law,
forget about it. It is:

10:19.452 --> 10:22.411
Little guys and nonprofits are screwed.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.537
I want you to go to our vet...

10:24.707 --> 10:28.291
...and find out how he disposes
of the animals he puts down.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.669
We're gonna need about half a dozen.

10:31.798 --> 10:32.914
Half a dozen what?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.044
Skeletons.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.380
To make it look authentic.

10:37.554 --> 10:41.468
Couple of dogs, cats. I think
we shampoo the occasional marmot.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.807
In order to melt structural components...

10:51.985 --> 10:54.773
...we need
a high-temperature accelerant fire.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.689
Your typical fire generates
about 2000 degrees.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.405
We add a little thermite,
we can boost that to 4500 degrees.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.662
If the fire department shows up early
and starts spraying water...

11:04.831 --> 11:08.575
...they'll just aggravate the flames.
Leave you nothing but memories.

11:09.961 --> 11:13.580
I never said I didn't love it,
I just said I shouldn't do it.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.213
Earl, you have a gift.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.750
Others create, you destroy.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.257
Mr. Hepworth. Thomas Dekker.

11:24.434 --> 11:28.394
As you know, the IRS is conducting
an audit of Critter Cabin...

11:28.563 --> 11:31.351
Let me ask you,
how come you get to audit me...

11:31.524 --> 11:33.516
...and I don't get to audit you?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.935
- About the audit...
- Granted, you use my money...

11:36.112 --> 11:38.775
...for some worthy causes.
Roads, schools.

11:38.948 --> 11:43.113
But building a border wall,
prosecuting people for smoking pot...

11:43.286 --> 11:47.371
...building even more prisons
to hold even more young men of color?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.283
Why should my money finance that?

11:50.835 --> 11:54.670
There seem to be discrepancies
in your unrelated business income...

11:54.839 --> 11:58.048
Hershey, Hershey, Hershey.
You're missing the point.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.757
If I could direct your attention
to Form 990-T, Part 1, 4A...

12:01.930 --> 12:05.423
The point, the essential point, is this:

12:05.600 --> 12:07.136
We're all sinners.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.230
- Sinning. That's the point?
- Lust. Gluttony. Sloth.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.765
Three of my favorites.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.731
But you're here because of my greed.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.988
Tell me, what's your sin, Mr. Hepworth?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.776
- I don't...
- Of course you do.

12:25.954 --> 12:29.948
For all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.332
Testify, Brother Hershey.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.585
- I don't think that...
- Don't think.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.746
- Flow.
- I...

12:36.923 --> 12:38.880
That's it. Let it out.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.417
- Let it out.
- I hate this job.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.179
Amen to that.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.304
My kid...

12:50.144 --> 12:51.555
...he's incredible.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.062
He's desperate to go
to Davenport Academy...

12:54.232 --> 12:57.851
...but the headmaster won't let him in
because of what I do.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.102
What I did.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.900
I audited his sister.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.818
Don't despair, Brother Hershey.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.075
Your job is what kept your son out...

13:11.249 --> 13:14.458
...and now it will be what gets him in.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.587
- How is it gonna do that?
- I'm going to do that.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.840
In exchange
for services rendered by you.

13:22.010 --> 13:26.630
Or, to be more precise,
not rendered by you.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.799
Rumor is you got a bomb
to drop on the task force.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.684
- That a fact?
- Tactical freaking nuke.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.061
I'm all a-tingle.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.766
I tailed Keen.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.808
She didn't lead me to Reddington.
Someone else.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.068
- Who?
- Robert Navarro.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.319
Navarro?
I figured he got himself whacked.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.693
What he got himself was a deal
with the feds.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.736
- Snitch?
- He cut a deal.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.449
Immunity in exchange for everything
he knows about Nash Syndicate.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.539
- Names, suppliers, amounts.
- He's gonna tell all that to the feds?

13:58.713 --> 14:00.955
Everything we've tried
to find out for a year.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.920
Talk about getting caught
with your hands in your pants.

14:04.093 --> 14:08.838
Navarro's gonna meet his contact today
at a fed safe-house on Water Street.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.881
The bureau's promising transcripts.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.761
That's not tactical nuke, my friend.
That's thermo-freaking-nuclear.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.648
- Let's go drop it on the boys.
- Go ahead. I'll be right there.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.613
We ran a sample of Edwards's virus,
which we're uploading to Atlanta.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.530
Naturally-occurring Nipah has
one strand of RNA. Hers has two.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.913
That sounds bad.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.167
She genetically spliced
a secondary strand onto the virus.

14:38.836 --> 14:42.329
No idea why. We'll know more
when we hear back from Atlanta.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.215
<i>Network alert. Network alert.</i>

14:46.636 --> 14:49.845
<i>Access denied.</i>

14:50.014 --> 14:52.006
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.424
I'm locked out.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.467
Atlanta's down.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.304
- Everyone's down.
- How's that possible?

14:58.481 --> 14:59.597
I have no idea.

15:00.733 --> 15:06.149
But it seems like the biological virus
is now infecting our entire network.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.485
A human virus infected
a computer network?

15:12.662 --> 15:14.028
How is that possible?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.162
Code is code. Ones and zeroes.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.827
We can manipulate the human genome
to implant malicious code into it.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.666
When the infected DNA
from the victims was analyzed...

15:23.840 --> 15:28.585
...and uploaded to the CDC's network,
the computer virus was uploaded with it.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.880
So the purpose of the outbreak was
to hijack the CDC's server.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.140
<i>And lock us out. But why?</i>

15:35.309 --> 15:38.643
<i>The server could give her
the locations and access codes...</i>

15:38.813 --> 15:40.270
<i>...to thousands of viruses.</i>

15:40.440 --> 15:43.228
<i>The only way I can see
what she's doing inside the system...</i>

15:43.401 --> 15:46.610
<i>...is to physically access
the server farm.</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:48.065
Then that's what you'll do.

15:48.239 --> 15:52.153
Sir, that's what I'd like to do,
there's just one small problem.

15:52.326 --> 15:55.865
This is the quarantine zone,
and this is the server farm...

15:56.038 --> 15:58.781
...that supplies
the CDC's computer system.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.290
A strange coincidence.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.168
Or Edwards chose her target
with that in mind.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.425
Thank you, Ms. Timmons.
The board couldn't be happier.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.390
Now, don't forget your jersey.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.562
Isn't it marvelous?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.064
Very sporty.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.691
- And please...
- Thank you.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.568
- Mr. Dekker, is it?
- Yes. Very impressive.

16:35.745 --> 16:39.534
What a gymnasium.
A real shrine to athleticism.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.664
I can just feel the testosterone.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.002
We've wanted to build it for years.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.710
But one neighbor refused to sell
an adjoining plot.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.249
Until five minutes ago.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.257
- The charming lady who just left?
- It's been a good day.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.218
Then allow me to make it
an even better one.

16:57.850 --> 17:03.312
Every great athletic facility
requires spectacular locker rooms...

17:03.481 --> 17:06.645
...for all those inspirational
pregame-sermons...

17:06.817 --> 17:08.809
...the halftime pep-talks...

17:08.986 --> 17:13.105
...all that postgame towel-snapping
and rump-slapping.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.901
Let me be forthright,
if you're willing to offer enrollment...

17:17.078 --> 17:22.073
...at the academy to a very,
very promising young man that I know...

17:22.250 --> 17:25.584
...then I'd be willing to pay
for those locker rooms.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.335
- That is very generous.
- His name is Charlie Hepworth.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.374
I know there's been bad blood...

17:32.552 --> 17:34.885
That's rather an understatement.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.262
His father's audit cost my sister
her company.

17:37.431 --> 17:42.517
Yes, but to be fair, should poor Charlie
have to suffer the consequences...

17:42.687 --> 17:46.681
...of his father's doggedness
and your sister's indiscretions?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.766
Thank you, Mr. Dekker...

17:49.944 --> 17:53.028
...but I'll have to turn down
your generous offer.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.780
Must be something I can do
to change your mind.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.362
I can't think of a thing.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.370
Well, let's see if I can.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.582
Can you really intercept cell phones
with that?

18:05.751 --> 18:08.994
Anyone in range makes a call,
this picks up their device ID number.

18:09.171 --> 18:13.632
That way we get whoever shows up
and anyone they reach out to for help.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.136
If I haven't said it, thank you for this.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.093
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.523
My girls call this "daddy mud."

18:32.028 --> 18:33.269
How old are they?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.903
Thirteen and 10.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.068
My wife took them last year.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.484
Found herself another guy.

18:41.579 --> 18:45.539
I have a daughter too.
She's not with me right now either.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.999
She's with her grandmother.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.500
I have to get through this first.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.337
My ex's guy...

18:57.053 --> 18:58.760
...lives in Orlando.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.717
Except for vacations, my kids do too.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.851
Life's something, isn't it?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.478
Unsolicited advice:

19:08.898 --> 19:10.560
You need a better lawyer.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.641
Make a deal.

19:13.694 --> 19:17.233
We catch Damascus,
you go see your daughter...

19:17.782 --> 19:20.650
- ...I get myself a new lawyer.
- Deal.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.869
Bar code in his window. It's a rental.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.877
- You recognize him?
- No.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.332
Maybe hired muscle.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.088
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

19:35.257 --> 19:38.295
<i>Yeah. I don't know,
but there's no sign of Navarro.</i>

19:39.387 --> 19:40.844
<i>Right.</i>

19:41.013 --> 19:43.175
<i>I'll go in for a closer look.</i>

19:44.308 --> 19:48.177
Inside the hot zone, your rebreather
will have 20 minutes of air.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.018
Beyond that, oxygen levels fall
and the environment inside your suit...

19:52.191 --> 19:53.978
...will change dramatically.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.735
Carbon monoxide levels spike,
causing nausea, dizziness.

19:57.905 --> 20:02.366
Got it. So if the virus doesn't kill me,
the suit will.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.868
- Nothing will kill you.
- We got you on comms...

20:05.037 --> 20:08.451
...so we can guide you to the server.
Once there, tap the terminal.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.583
Figure out what Edwards is doing
in there and get out.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.833
Okay, listen.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.917
You can do this.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.626
You're going to be great.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.257
Okay?

20:22.638 --> 20:25.676
- What?
- I have to pee.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.801
Kidding.

20:29.687 --> 20:33.101
Totally kidding. Come on,
I'm trying to lighten the mood.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.560
What? Okay.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.747
You getting this?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.620
Not yet.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.995
- He's leaving.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

20:57.173 --> 21:00.086
<i>Nobody. The place is empty.</i>

21:00.259 --> 21:03.218
<i>Maybe you got bad intel,
but there's nobody here.</i>

21:04.513 --> 21:07.130
We're not gonna get
another shot at this.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.050
We won't need one.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.275
When you exit the elevator,
there's a door...

21:19.445 --> 21:22.233
...to your immediate right.
That's the server room.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.822
I see it.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.609
<i>- How am I doing on oxygen?</i>
- Nine minutes.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.335
Nine minutes, huh?

21:39.006 --> 21:42.215
- Actually, eight.
- Aram, you gotta listen to me.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.252
<i>You're looking for Server Row D-52.</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:47.637
Fourth row from the east wall.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.641
Dr. Moshay, this is probably
as good a time as any...

21:50.810 --> 21:54.599
...to tell you how much I admire
the CDC and the work you do.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.185
<i>But perhaps one
of your scientists could...</i>

21:57.358 --> 22:01.318
Could find a way to equip
these hazmat suits with a simple...

22:01.487 --> 22:05.572
...in-line recirculating fan
to cool them off a bit that...

22:05.741 --> 22:08.324
Oh, okay. I found it. D-52. We're here.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.985
It's... Okay, okay.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.698
- Seven minutes.
- He'll make it.

22:11.872 --> 22:15.456
- I need the root password.
<i>- It's 12, net, four, hotel, bravo.</i>

22:15.626 --> 22:17.208
Honestly, I can't...

22:17.795 --> 22:20.208
I can't really see through this mask.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.840
Okay, hold on. I'm in. I'm in.
All right. Now I'm...

22:24.009 --> 22:26.922
...scanning for unknown processes.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.134
He's burning through his air faster
than he should. Pull him out.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.344
- Aram, you need to focus.
<i>- I am.</i>

22:32.893 --> 22:35.101
- I can't see here.
<i>- You're gonna have to.</i>

22:35.271 --> 22:37.354
<i>Aram, do you remember Thanksgiving?</i>

22:37.523 --> 22:40.061
The immigration diatribe
your brother-in-law went on?

22:40.234 --> 22:42.897
<i>- Remember how you coped?</i>
- I gorged on apple cobbler.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.027
You told me, you breathed.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.115
- I breathed.
<i>- You tried to breathe.</i>

22:49.285 --> 22:51.527
Remember when you focused
on breathing?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.491
- Call it.
- You found a sense of calm.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.122
You could separate yourself
from anxiety and just be.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.329
Samar, this is...

22:58.502 --> 23:01.461
<i>I know you're helping,
but I figured it out.</i>

23:01.630 --> 23:03.838
- She's jumped the system.
- What does that mean?

23:04.008 --> 23:06.500
Government computer systems
are networked.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.464
If what I'm seeing here is right...

23:08.637 --> 23:11.254
...then Edwards is using
the CDC portal to launch...

23:11.432 --> 23:14.015
...a search in SlPRnet and the DoD.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.471
The most classified networks
in the country.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.056
She's trolling their databases.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.937
- Looking for what?
<i>- That's just it.</i>

23:20.107 --> 23:22.975
She's using a DNA sample in her search.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.189
It's not a "what."

23:26.155 --> 23:27.646
It's "who."

23:28.157 --> 23:30.695
<i>I think she's looking for somebody.</i>

23:34.538 --> 23:36.951
The outbreak was just a way
to ID someone.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.491
Yeah, she's looking
to put a name to DNA.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.035
- Who? Family member? Loved one?
- Enemy?

23:42.212 --> 23:45.831
I wanna know the second you find out.
Whoever it is may need our protection.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.920
- Agent Keen.
- Bad time?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.676
Not at all. Did anyone take the bait?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.508
Yes, a merc, some muscle.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.673
But he was reporting
to whoever sent him.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.309
That's the person I'm looking for,
which is why I need your help.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.933
- What can I do?
- The guy who showed up...

24:01.106 --> 24:02.972
...Singleton intercepted his phone.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.688
- A burner.
- You must know who he called.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.605
- I do. One number, also a burner.
- I'll geolocate him.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.024
- You're in the middle of a big case...
- Do it.

24:12.201 --> 24:15.365
CDC's confirming the antidote.
We'll track the DNA.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.453
- You sure?
- Of course.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.990
It's imperative we find Tom's killer.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.833
How?

24:22.002 --> 24:25.120
A quit claim? But we were in contract.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.415
As Old Man Quimby,
my fencing instructor, used to say:

24:28.592 --> 24:33.587
"If 'ifs' and 'buts' were candy and nuts,
oh, what a Christmas we'd have."

24:33.764 --> 24:35.380
My God, I loved the foil.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.344
She agreed to sell to us.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.511
As it turns out,
you weren't offering quite enough.

24:41.772 --> 24:45.982
She accepted my proposal over
the most delicious buckwheat blini...

24:46.151 --> 24:50.145
...and a tour
of her surprisingly vast collection...

24:50.322 --> 24:52.564
...of ceramic salt and pepper shakers.

24:53.283 --> 24:57.778
But the funny thing is,
I have absolutely no use for the place.

24:57.955 --> 25:01.039
If only there were something
you could do...

25:01.208 --> 25:05.043
...to help me think of a constructive way
to develop the property.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.999
- Any good ideas?
- No.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.879
- Really?
- Absolutely not.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.756
Maybe a massage parlor.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.542
The athletes would love it.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.961
Oh, my God.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.176
Fine.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.888
I'll admit him, the Hepworth kid...

25:21.061 --> 25:23.929
...if you throw in the locker room.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.104
"If wishes were horses,
beggars would ride."

25:28.277 --> 25:29.518
Ah, Quimby.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.937
The man was a walking aphorism.

25:33.449 --> 25:37.659
We found who Edwards was looking for.
Caleb James Cronin, retired Navy SEAL.

25:37.828 --> 25:41.492
- She was looking up his DNA.
- Explains her extraordinary steps.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.952
The ID of anyone in Special Ops
is classified.

25:44.126 --> 25:47.870
- What it doesn't explain is why she cares.
- Cronin killed her husband.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.500
The opium.

25:49.673 --> 25:53.166
He's the one who caught Edwards
stealing it. JAG ruled it was self-defense.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.084
She'd like to render her own verdict.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.096
<i>If she knows who he is,
it won't take her long to find him.</i>

25:58.265 --> 26:01.258
<i>- We need to find him first.</i>
- Lt. Caleb Cronin?

26:04.980 --> 26:06.937
What the hell was that?

26:08.150 --> 26:09.937
Invite me in and I'll explain.

26:16.867 --> 26:19.951
Red, I've been thinking
about this all wrong.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.284
You're the fancy fugitive
the IRS can't touch.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.494
Heddie and I,
our names are all over this.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.330
This audit is gonna land us in jail
where she belongs.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.668
But I need to feel the sun on my face
and the breeze on my neck.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.297
So here you go.

26:33.467 --> 26:37.962
A dachshund, husky, chow, pug,
beagle, two Siamese, a chinchilla...

26:38.138 --> 26:40.881
...and my appreciation
for torching the place.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.641
As it turns out, that won't be necessary.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.269
He promised me a sure thing,
gives me Viagra.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.896
All I have to show for it
is a four-hour erection.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.771
Who knew an IRS agent
would be so amenable?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.904
Wait. You're...?
You're not burning down the place?

26:56.073 --> 26:58.986
Did you hear what I said?
We'll go to jail for this.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.401
Brother Hershey, behold a miracle.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.864
You got Charlie in.

27:08.043 --> 27:12.003
- I can't thank you enough.
- Of course you can. That's why I did it.

27:13.799 --> 27:18.169
There's nothing I've wanted more
than for my son to go to Davenport.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.756
And...

27:21.181 --> 27:25.391
...if it were in my power
to bury this audit, I would.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.978
But it is in your power.
You're the auditor.

27:29.565 --> 27:32.854
Yes, I was when we came
to our understanding...

27:33.026 --> 27:34.437
...but there's been a change.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.108
I'm out, and Larry Hotchkiss is in.

27:38.282 --> 27:42.743
He'll be here tomorrow at 9
to examine your books.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.737
I am so sorry.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.205
So am I, Brother Hershey.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.707
So am I.

27:51.545 --> 27:55.209
It appears we're going to need
that chinchilla after all.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.256
Okay.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.587
Come on.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.503
- I'm geolocating now.
- Singleton, can you talk?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.922
- You got a location?
- Almost.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.635
Okay, okay, okay.

28:06.143 --> 28:09.557
All right. Looks like there.
There, 447 Skidmore.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.813
- Did you get that?
<i>- Call the burner.</i>

28:11.982 --> 28:14.645
What? Why?
What good's that gonna do?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.811
It'll tell me what task-force member
killed your husband.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.114
That address, 447 Skidmore,
that's your office.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.526
- Call the number.
<i>- Not until we get units there.</i>

28:24.703 --> 28:26.069
<i>You need back...</i>

28:26.580 --> 28:28.071
Singleton?

28:31.293 --> 28:32.409
Is there a problem?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.790
I hope not.

29:00.197 --> 29:03.065
Your girls are in Orlando, right?

29:06.036 --> 29:09.871
You can open your mouth,
but whatever happens to me...

29:10.040 --> 29:13.408
...I got people, Norm.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.122
A lot of people.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.956
You do anything stupid...

29:19.466 --> 29:23.005
...and those girls of yours are gonna pay.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.383
Let's go for a ride.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.444
That cough is your body trying
to fight genetic material...

29:48.620 --> 29:50.577
...I've introduced into your bloodstream.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.866
It'll be followed by a migraine,
double vision.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.914
Your brain is swelling, lieutenant.

29:57.087 --> 30:00.455
It will continue to until your skull
can't accommodate its size.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.873
Look.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.760
- Whatever this is...
- There is a cure, however.

30:06.305 --> 30:10.219
And I have it. But for that,
I'm gonna need something in return.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.175
Who are you?

30:14.730 --> 30:17.643
Dennis Edwards, Navy SEAL.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.309
Manbij, Syria. You remember him?

30:22.279 --> 30:23.941
He was my husband.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.568
It wasn't my fault.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.655
What happened,
your husband's death, it was...

30:30.912 --> 30:32.153
It was an accident.

30:32.331 --> 30:36.245
You convinced JAG
that he stole a truckload of opium.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.954
But I know differently.

30:38.128 --> 30:41.667
I know
because he delayed shipping out...

30:42.257 --> 30:45.546
- ...to find out who'd done it.
- No, that's...

30:46.303 --> 30:48.511
That is not right.
Whatever he told you...

30:48.680 --> 30:50.797
When my husband's effects
were returned...

30:50.974 --> 30:53.387
...there was blood on his uniform.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.723
I tested it.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.387
Found two sets of DNA.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.557
His and the Navy SEAL who killed him.

31:00.901 --> 31:01.982
You.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.403
I know you stole the opium.

31:09.576 --> 31:13.490
I know you blamed it on my husband,
then murdered him to cover your tracks.

31:13.663 --> 31:17.623
What I don't know is
who else was involved.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.169
You've heard about the outbreak.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.550
That was me.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.882
I've infected you
with an accelerated variant.

31:31.056 --> 31:35.551
You'll be dead in three hours
unless you get the antidote.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.476
So...

31:37.938 --> 31:39.725
...lieutenant...

31:41.274 --> 31:43.266
...who helped you kill my husband?

31:57.249 --> 31:58.706
Oh, God.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.287
Earl, I've been thinking.

32:04.714 --> 32:08.207
Who am I to stand
between you and your calling?

32:08.385 --> 32:11.549
You can make disappear
in one hour what it took...

32:11.721 --> 32:13.838
...a hundred men a year to create?

32:14.015 --> 32:16.257
I take it the IRS wasn't
so amenable after all.

32:17.227 --> 32:20.095
There may have been a slight hiccup.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.683
Men plan. God laughs.

32:21.857 --> 32:25.316
- The audit begins tomorrow, 9 a.m.
- Only there is no God.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.899
- It's all a big chemical reaction.
- Can you do it by then?

32:29.781 --> 32:33.320
I need someone
who sees the fire in my eyes...

32:33.493 --> 32:35.200
...and wants to play with it.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.995
Is that a yes or a no?

32:38.165 --> 32:40.532
Or is a haiku sometimes just a haiku?

32:40.709 --> 32:43.372
I have five smoke detectors,
16 sprinkler heads...

32:43.545 --> 32:46.413
- ...and a backflow preventer to install.
- Then...

32:46.590 --> 32:49.173
The plan's in my head.
Supplies are in the van.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.460
Every shred of evidence will be reduced
to ashes by dawn.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.180
I do see the fire in your eyes.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.215
And it's terrifying.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.728
FBI!

33:03.899 --> 33:06.232
FBI! Down! Move!

33:10.614 --> 33:11.650
Ressler.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.322
You think she infected him?

33:17.496 --> 33:19.829
Or tried. There was some struggle.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.536
He gets the upper hand.
He's bigger, a SEAL.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.622
Take her where? She came here
to get her revenge.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.127
Agents!

33:27.631 --> 33:29.873
This is Jill Conway, a neighbor.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.712
I saw them. He had a gun.

33:31.885 --> 33:34.502
All right. Get her full statement.
Thank you.

33:34.888 --> 33:37.346
Aram, we may have a hostage situation.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.260
<i>Run a profile on Cronin. Credit cards,
vehicle registration, the works.</i>

33:41.436 --> 33:42.597
Okay, I'm on it.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.601
Let me drive.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.526
- Please. I can help.
- Stop. Just...

33:53.865 --> 33:55.197
How much further?

33:55.367 --> 33:56.608
Left at the light.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.196
Onto Shore Boulevard.

34:05.418 --> 34:09.583
I never wanted to kill you. I just wanted
to clear my husband's name.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.842
<i>A traffic cam clocked Cronin's vehicle...</i>

34:16.012 --> 34:17.799
...three minutes ago,
westbound on 495.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.885
<i>I've got an N. Y.P.D. unit tailing them.</i>

34:20.058 --> 34:22.516
- Headed towards Astoria.
- That's where Edwards lives.

34:22.686 --> 34:25.929
They're headed to her house.
Aram, have N.Y.P.D. set a perimeter.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.188
Run him onto a service road
at Hell Gate Bridge.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.226
Call Dr. Moshay.
Tell her we have a likely infection.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.146
We need response units on-site.

34:34.656 --> 34:36.818
- What do we got?
- He's symptomatic.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.199
Likely infected, which means she is too.

34:39.369 --> 34:42.407
I've asked law enforcement
to keep them at bay until you arrive.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.914
Tell me if it's safe to send my people in.

34:45.083 --> 34:49.327
- So you can treat them?
- Yes. Atlanta cleared the antidote.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.460
We have doses ready to go.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.338
What about him? Is he armed?

34:53.507 --> 34:55.215
We think so.

34:55.385 --> 34:59.004
- Well, then it's not safe to treat them.
- Where are you going?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.426
Ressler?

35:19.701 --> 35:22.739
- All right. Hold on. Not so fast.
- I need medicine.

35:22.912 --> 35:26.451
She infected me with some kind of...
Some virus.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.582
- Where's the weapon?
- Did you hear me?

35:28.752 --> 35:31.836
This woman, she's the reason.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.748
- She's infected half the city.
- I asked you a question.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.040
Where's the weapon?

35:42.932 --> 35:45.299
I only wanted
to clear my husband's name.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.968
To prove his innocence.

35:47.145 --> 35:51.355
- I didn't want anybody to get hurt.
- His innocence? Hey, hold up.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.981
- What does she mean, "his innocence"?
- Are you insane?

35:57.155 --> 36:00.569
This man takes another step,
you have permission to shoot.

36:00.742 --> 36:03.860
- He doesn't have much time.
- How about we make a trade?

36:04.037 --> 36:06.370
Your life for the truth
about Dennis Edwards.

36:06.539 --> 36:07.575
I told the truth.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.706
Unless you wanna leave
in a hazmat bag...

36:09.876 --> 36:13.495
...you're gonna tell me what happened
to this woman's husband in Raqqa.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.585
Please. I'm begging you.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.382
He's gonna die.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.338
Yeah, I guess so.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.219
Okay, stop!

36:23.640 --> 36:25.347
Stop.

36:26.226 --> 36:29.139
The opium, we took it.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.137
Edwards figured it out.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.022
He was gonna turn us in.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.024
I want names.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.145
Oz Stone. Frank McGraw.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.486
- Who pulled the trigger?
- I did, okay?

36:42.659 --> 36:43.945
Are you happy?

36:44.119 --> 36:45.985
I shot him.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.112
Bring them in!

36:49.374 --> 36:52.492
When it's safe, arrest them both.

37:04.806 --> 37:08.220
Hey. Singleton, it's me again.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.009
You don't seem to be home.

37:10.186 --> 37:13.679
And you don't answer your calls, so...

37:14.441 --> 37:17.900
...I'm getting worried.
Call me back when you get this.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.696
- Singleton?
- He's not at home?

37:22.866 --> 37:25.859
No. He's not answering his cell either.

37:26.035 --> 37:29.073
- This is what I was afraid of.
<i>- Why do you say that?</i>

37:29.247 --> 37:30.363
It may be nothing.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.332
I'm gonna give you an address.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.211
Where the hell you been?

37:42.385 --> 37:45.503
The auditor's in the bathroom
washing up for the kill.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.093
I couldn't bring myself to burn it down.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.598
I like it here.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.351
Good for you. Why don't you stay here
and pat the pets.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.183
- We'll be in jail with the animals.
- I don't think so.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.848
I should've known
you'd throw us under the bus.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.313
Shut your mouth, and look and learn.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.441
- Oh, Mr. Dekker, it's your lucky day.
- Why is that?

38:07.619 --> 38:12.205
Our field office caught fire last night.
Yeah, a wire shorted in the basement.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.990
<i>Sparked a bag of deicing chemicals
someone left there.</i>

38:15.168 --> 38:19.128
<i>We store the materials we prepare
for audits in the basement.</i>

38:19.297 --> 38:21.880
As a result, yours has been
indefinitely postponed.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.250
That is a bit of luck.

38:25.178 --> 38:26.840
We'll be in touch.

38:27.013 --> 38:30.552
I assume that you assume
the fire was the work of an arsonist.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.433
We did, but we found no evidence of it.

38:33.603 --> 38:36.562
All we know is that the fire started
inside the smoke alarm.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.268
How ironic.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.993
Present arms. Ready, aim, fire.

39:01.381 --> 39:04.874
Ready, aim, fire.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.504
Ready, aim, fire.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.783
Mr. Fagen.

40:23.922 --> 40:27.916
I was staring at those trees,
thinking how I wanted to burn them.

40:29.594 --> 40:34.510
I realize that I've stoked the flame,
which is why I brought you this.

40:40.980 --> 40:44.394
<i>- Embrace the Struggle.</i>
- Zig Ziglar at his most persuasive.

40:44.567 --> 40:47.935
- Familiar with his work?
- He's a motivational speaker.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.901
Who motivated me to quit smoking
and shoot from the neck down.

40:52.075 --> 40:55.284
You think he can motivate me
not to burn those trees.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.160
A retainer.

40:57.747 --> 41:00.330
For services not yet rendered.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.204
Read the book.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.246
Think positive. Control your urges.

41:06.422 --> 41:09.256
And I'll put your gift to good use.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.153
Stabbed multiple times.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.279
Wallet gone.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.443
They're saying it was a robbery.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.868
I want witness statements,
CCTV footage...

41:45.044 --> 41:47.331
...and a forensic report
on my desk an hour ago.

41:47.505 --> 41:51.089
Nobody sleeps until we find
the son of a bitch who did this.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.011
Elizabeth.

42:11.654 --> 42:12.861
What is it?

42:13.614 --> 42:15.355
That's him.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.574
The bald man.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.576
Damascus.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.822
That's the man who killed Tom.
