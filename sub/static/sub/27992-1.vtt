WEBVTT

02:05.004 --> 02:06.068
Morning.

02:06.068 --> 02:08.044
Morning.

02:08.044 --> 02:11.068
- Do you want coffee? - Yeah,
cheers. I could use one.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.044
You out last night?

02:14.044 --> 02:16.016
Only to put out the bins.

02:16.016 --> 02:19.004
Does that count? Just couldn't sleep.

02:19.004 --> 02:22.024
Guy upstairs snores like a buffalo.

02:22.024 --> 02:24.040
- You?
- Er, no.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.056
Er, it's like a silent retreat,
ma house, these days -

02:28.056 --> 02:29.096
without all the fun.

02:32.056 --> 02:37.012
Tosh, you've still got your earplugs in.

02:37.012 --> 02:39.044
Thank God!

02:39.044 --> 02:41.056
I thought was having a psychotic episode.

02:41.056 --> 02:44.024
Don't get too comfortable, folks.

02:44.024 --> 02:46.084
You need to get down to Minn Beach, now.

02:58.004 --> 03:01.000
Looks like it's been severed
just below the elbow.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.064
Has there been any reports of
accidents at sea or out on the rigs?

03:04.064 --> 03:07.092
No, I've already checked
with the coastguard.

03:07.092 --> 03:10.000
Bone's been cut clean through.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.024
And look at the fingers.

03:12.024 --> 03:13.084
No fingerprints.

03:13.084 --> 03:16.008
They've been burned off.

03:16.008 --> 03:19.064
Any chance the owner's still alive
and bleeding out somewhere?

03:19.064 --> 03:20.080
Oh, I doubt it

03:20.080 --> 03:23.064
cos this looks like it's
been severed postmortem

03:23.064 --> 03:26.032
and it's been in the water for a few days.

03:27.044 --> 03:30.016
Sandy, how long do you think it would take

03:30.016 --> 03:32.080
something from Norway to wash up here?

03:32.080 --> 03:34.040
Not sure.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.060
About a week, probably.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.028
Tosh, will you check the tidal streams

03:39.028 --> 03:42.052
and see if we can figure
out where this came from?

03:52.084 --> 03:54.008
Sorry to keep you, Jimmy.

03:54.008 --> 03:56.096
I just want to do a couple of tests myself.

03:56.096 --> 03:58.040
And we have a problem.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.012
I've found traces of Lye on
the hand and lower arm.

04:01.012 --> 04:03.080
OK. What's that?

04:03.080 --> 04:05.012
Sodium hydroxide.

04:06.016 --> 04:08.076
It's used as an industrial cleaner,

04:08.076 --> 04:10.060
or to make soap,

04:10.060 --> 04:13.072
but it can turn a body
into liquid in three hours

04:13.072 --> 04:16.031
if heated to the correct temperature.

04:17.043 --> 04:20.079
Are you saying somebody's
tried to dissolve that hand?

04:20.079 --> 04:22.028
More than likely.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.060
And I'd forget about tidal streams.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.068
There's soil under the nails.

04:26.068 --> 04:28.008
Lime and fertiliser -

04:28.008 --> 04:29.064
common on crofts here.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.096
It suggests it came from Shetland.

05:15.052 --> 05:17.016
Tidal report.

05:17.016 --> 05:19.084
With the prevailing currents,
it doesn't seem likely that...

05:19.084 --> 05:20.096
Sandy, Sandy, it's fine.

05:20.096 --> 05:23.056
It looks like we might be
looking a wee bit closer to home.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.064
Somebody's attempted to dissolve it in lye,

05:25.064 --> 05:27.032
then attempted to dump it at sea.

05:27.032 --> 05:28.056
This just in.

05:28.056 --> 05:31.016
A severed head has washed up by Eswick.

05:38.084 --> 05:40.000
Tosh, you're with me.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.096
Sandy, find out which businesses
are using lye, where it's sold,

05:43.096 --> 05:45.036
and who's buying it.

05:52.008 --> 05:55.024
We'll need to get a forensic
team from the mainland.

05:55.024 --> 05:57.048
OK, Cora. Just give me the basics.

05:58.092 --> 06:02.012
Well, it appears to be the
partly dissolved body parts

06:02.012 --> 06:03.060
of a young male.

06:03.060 --> 06:07.068
I'm making an educated guess that
the hand is from the same person.

06:07.068 --> 06:09.076
The peat cutter says he's
been working in this area

06:09.076 --> 06:11.004
for a couple of days.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.040
He hasn't seen anyone
dumping anything into the sea.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.012
Looks like he sustained a
head wound before he died.

06:18.012 --> 06:21.008
Any chance we can get
some DNA out of the hold-all?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.044
Sandy?

06:24.044 --> 06:25.088
Genuine lye,

06:25.088 --> 06:27.088
there's quite a few folk
using it on the isles.

06:27.088 --> 06:29.092
Handmade soap companies.

06:29.092 --> 06:32.036
The paper mill uses it
for pulping wood.

06:32.036 --> 06:36.004
The most recent buyer was Hayes,

06:36.004 --> 06:38.036
a scrap merchant dealer
and building contractor.

06:38.036 --> 06:39.096
Aye, I know who you mean.

07:01.016 --> 07:02.040
I'm DI Perez.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.012
This is DS McIntosh.

07:04.012 --> 07:05.096
Aye, what brings you up here?

07:05.096 --> 07:08.056
We've found some remains
- a young man,

07:08.056 --> 07:10.008
African, or Afro Caribbean -

07:10.008 --> 07:12.064
we wondered if you knew
anyone fitting that description?

07:12.064 --> 07:15.068
African?
What, he fall out of a plane?

07:15.068 --> 07:18.008
There's no need for that, Prentice.

07:18.008 --> 07:21.056
No, we haven't seen anyone like that.

07:26.060 --> 07:29.048
What do you use that for?

07:29.048 --> 07:31.028
Use what? The lye.

07:33.068 --> 07:35.092
We're doing more scrap metal these days.

07:35.092 --> 07:38.040
It's good for cleaning the
grease and fat from engines,

07:38.040 --> 07:40.076
ovens, cookers.

07:42.096 --> 07:45.040
You sold any of it to anyone?

07:45.040 --> 07:46.076
No.

07:48.088 --> 07:51.052
Any of it go missing?
Not that I'm aware of, no.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
We did have some stuff go missing
- some tools.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.084
They might have taken more.

07:58.084 --> 08:00.008
Haven't checked.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.020
Why didn't you report it?

08:04.044 --> 08:06.080
Wasn't worth the bother.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.000
You lot never get it back, do you?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.084
Well, check now and let us know.

08:18.072 --> 08:21.088
Charmer, isn't he? They been here long?

08:21.088 --> 08:24.008
Long as I remember.

08:24.008 --> 08:27.060
He'd be daft as a door brush
to do something like this

08:27.060 --> 08:28.080
and use his own lye.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.016
Maybe he's not as smart as he looks.

08:52.008 --> 08:55.092
Picked up a young guy on the
town CCTV from five days ago -

08:55.092 --> 08:58.048
matches the victim's description.

08:58.048 --> 09:03.068
This was him on Harbour Street,
heading up towards Commercial Road.

09:03.068 --> 09:05.004
Do you recognise him?

09:05.004 --> 09:06.028
No, he's new to me.

09:09.020 --> 09:13.036
Right, check all the footage
that we've got from the harbour

09:13.036 --> 09:16.060
and the square, and see
if you can find him again.

09:17.092 --> 09:20.052
We've got hardly any locals from
an Afro-Caribbean background

09:20.052 --> 09:21.096
and they're all accounted for.

09:21.096 --> 09:24.036
No temp staff missing either.

09:24.036 --> 09:26.032
OK, so he was a visitor then?

09:33.036 --> 09:36.004
Well, CCTV lost him about here.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.088
The bus station.

09:38.088 --> 09:41.004
Must have been going somewhere.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.012
Is this everything he left with you?

09:45.012 --> 09:46.048
It was, aye.

09:46.048 --> 09:48.020
He never came back for it.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.084
Toothbrush, change of socks,
not much else.

09:53.076 --> 09:55.012
Do you know what bus he got on?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.092
He didn't wait around that long.

09:56.092 --> 10:00.012
Probably the 14:50 up to Eswick.

10:00.012 --> 10:01.084
Did he give you a name and address?

10:01.084 --> 10:03.068
Just a first name.

10:03.068 --> 10:04.092
Daniel.

10:06.084 --> 10:08.092
You got a pencil I could borrow?

10:08.092 --> 10:11.076
Aye, sure.Thanks.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.036
Pipeline?

10:27.012 --> 10:31.092
Daniel first appears four
days ago at the ferry port,

10:31.092 --> 10:35.080
with his haversack, at 7:20 a.m.

10:35.080 --> 10:40.060
Then we see him in Lerwick
town centre at 9:23 a.m.,

10:40.060 --> 10:44.088
where he goes from shop to shop,
but he doesn't seem to buy anything.

10:46.084 --> 10:51.020
He then shows up at the fish
processing plant at 11:23 a.m.,

10:51.020 --> 10:52.096
where he spent half an hour.

10:52.096 --> 10:57.012
Tosh, find out, if you can, what
our guy was doing down there.

10:57.012 --> 11:00.064
And then we pick him again,
at the harbour,

11:00.064 --> 11:04.012
where he takes an interest in a
boat called The Silver Darling.

11:04.012 --> 11:06.044
That boat belongs to Calum Dunwoody.

11:06.044 --> 11:08.048
Looks like we need to
speak to Mr Dunwoody.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.092
I'm pretty sure I saw him
heading out to sea the other day.

11:10.092 --> 11:12.080
He probably won't be back for a few days.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.040
Billy, get in touch with the coastguard

11:15.040 --> 11:18.000
and request that he come back in again.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.068
Right, and then we've got
nothing until we pick him up again

11:21.068 --> 11:24.040
at the bus station, where
I think we can assume

11:24.040 --> 11:26.072
he got on the bus to Eswick.

11:26.072 --> 11:29.036
And then, shortly after that,
he was killed.

11:30.068 --> 11:33.092
The press are already
calling, just so you know.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.012
Thank you.

11:44.052 --> 11:47.028
He spoke with an accent,
but I didn't recognise it.

11:47.028 --> 11:49.016
African, maybe. What did he want?

11:49.016 --> 11:51.048
To a have a look around.

11:51.048 --> 11:53.076
I said not unless he told me why.

11:53.076 --> 11:56.044
He said he was... he was studying
to work in the fishing industry.

11:56.044 --> 11:58.068
I smelt a rat, told him to bugger off.

11:58.068 --> 12:01.072
Why? It's not like you have
trade secrets to protect, is it?

12:01.072 --> 12:04.064
He could have been
checking on our staff levels,

12:04.064 --> 12:06.032
our machinery, who knows?

12:06.032 --> 12:08.060
All right, we'll be in touch, Mr Laird.

12:31.016 --> 12:34.040
The DNA from the toothbrush matches.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.092
The body is Daniel.

12:35.092 --> 12:39.016
But there's no match in
the database for his DNA.

12:39.016 --> 12:43.048
And they found traces of cocaine
in the hold-all from the inlet.

12:43.048 --> 12:46.052
Not in the haversack,
though? No, just in the hold-all.

12:47.048 --> 12:48.080
I got the feeling Laird,

12:48.080 --> 12:51.092
the fish factory manager over
there, was fobbing me off.

12:51.092 --> 12:53.068
I'd like to dig a bit deeper,
if that's OK.

12:53.068 --> 12:55.088
Yeah, that's fine by me.

12:55.088 --> 12:57.084
Oh, shit, I have to be somewhere.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.084
I know, I'm late, I'm sorry.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.064
Some things never change.

13:17.008 --> 13:19.084
You're here now,
that's all that matters.

13:19.084 --> 13:22.036
Come on through.
There's plenty of food left.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.060
Er, no.

13:23.060 --> 13:26.056
Em, I can't stay. I've just
come to show my face.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.096
That's a shame.

13:27.096 --> 13:30.000
OK, everyone, a toast.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.056
To Chris and Alice.

13:31.056 --> 13:34.048
This is their official
welcome to Shetland.

13:47.044 --> 13:51.000
- You settling in OK?
- Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.016
How about the refuge,
how's that coming along?

13:53.016 --> 13:55.080
Well, still putting the last
of the funding in place,

13:55.080 --> 13:58.032
but we're opening tomorrow
come hell or high water.

13:58.032 --> 14:01.088
Listen, see if you need me to
make any phone calls, just ask me.

14:01.088 --> 14:03.020
I will.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.060
How's the renovation going?

14:07.060 --> 14:11.052
Well, I'm not allowed near the
place until he's finished gutting it.

14:11.052 --> 14:14.004
We're going to turn it into
an outdoor activities centre.

14:14.004 --> 14:16.024
What do you think? - Yeah,
I think that's a great idea.

14:16.024 --> 14:18.064
And how long till we can move in?
- Tell him.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.012
Four or five months. No time at all.

14:22.012 --> 14:25.008
If you get bored of this place,
you can always move in with Jimmy.

14:25.008 --> 14:26.048
Oh, yeah, you'd love that.

14:26.048 --> 14:29.092
One big dysfunctional family.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.012
Cheese and pickle.

14:33.012 --> 14:34.044
No tuna?

14:34.044 --> 14:36.048
It was either that or tongue.

14:36.048 --> 14:38.072
I got some background on
Calum Dunwoody

14:38.072 --> 14:40.088
I think you should take a look at.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.036
It seems he was in a
bit of financial difficulty.

14:43.036 --> 14:46.004
And if he was defaulting
on payments for his boat,

14:46.004 --> 14:48.048
he might have gotten
himself involved in drugs.

14:48.048 --> 14:50.052
With the men coming in to
work on the new refinery,

14:50.052 --> 14:52.028
there's a market for sure.

14:52.028 --> 14:56.064
Do you want me to get a
search warrant for Silver Darling?

14:56.064 --> 14:59.012
We don't have reasonable cause,
not yet,

14:59.012 --> 15:01.000
so let me speak to him first.

15:01.096 --> 15:04.060
Billy, get an image of Daniel
out to the media tonight

15:04.060 --> 15:05.084
and make it nationwide.

15:07.036 --> 15:10.036
Somebody, somewhere,
has to recognise him.

15:20.072 --> 15:22.016
Hi.

15:22.016 --> 15:24.068
An artist's impression of a
young man whose remains

15:24.068 --> 15:26.072
have been found on the
Shetland Islands.

15:26.072 --> 15:29.024
Anyone with information on
the identity of this young man,

15:29.024 --> 15:31.084
known only as Daniel, are
urged to contact Shetland Police.

15:31.084 --> 15:35.012
He was in his early
twenties, with short black hair,

15:35.012 --> 15:37.056
and was wearing a light grey suit...

16:01.092 --> 16:06.092
Mr Dunwoody? I'm Perez.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.064
I hope you've got a good reason
for interrupting my trip, Inspector.

16:11.064 --> 16:13.064
You do know this is how
I make my living?

16:13.064 --> 16:16.048
Aye, I'm sorry. I didn't
really have much choice.

16:16.048 --> 16:18.076
There was a young guy who
was seen down by your boat

16:18.076 --> 16:20.060
the other day,
and he's turned up dead,

16:20.060 --> 16:24.004
so we're just trying to work out
who he was.

16:24.004 --> 16:26.008
What young man? What
are you talking about?

16:26.008 --> 16:28.060
Young black guy in a grey suit.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.008
When was this?

16:30.008 --> 16:32.020
Just before you went out to sea.

16:35.044 --> 16:39.016
Aye, parts of his body have
washed up on the beach.

16:39.016 --> 16:41.004
That's terrible.Aye.

16:42.096 --> 16:46.068
You don't think I had something
to do with that, do you?

16:46.068 --> 16:50.008
I'm just trying to work out why he
was be so interested in your boat.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.012
I never spoke to him,
so how would I know?

16:57.092 --> 17:00.088
The Silver Darlings.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.071
One of my favourite books.

17:04.071 --> 17:07.000
I've never read it.
My wife named the boat.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
So, how's things going anyway?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.056
I hear the quota hits some
people harder than others.

17:11.056 --> 17:12.096
You managing to make ends meet?

17:12.096 --> 17:15.044
Aye, you know I'm washing my face,
y'know.

17:15.044 --> 17:18.012
Thought about branching out?

17:18.012 --> 17:21.003
I think I'll stick to fishing
for the moment.

17:21.003 --> 17:22.028
I can make it work.

17:24.092 --> 17:28.051
Right, so if I was to get a
search warrant for your boat,

17:28.051 --> 17:31.092
I wouldn't find any trace of
drugs or anything like that, no?

17:31.092 --> 17:34.080
You can do what you have to do.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.056
But I'm telling you, I don't
know who that young guy was

17:37.056 --> 17:40.060
and my wife can vouch for
my whereabouts

17:40.060 --> 17:43.020
every single night before I left. OK.

17:48.052 --> 17:52.048
Here's the deal, Calum, I
don't want you going back out

17:52.048 --> 17:56.012
until I get a clearer picture of
what that young man was doing here.

17:56.012 --> 17:59.096
I need to work. Well, you will...

17:59.096 --> 18:01.056
..but not until I get some answers.

18:11.084 --> 18:14.048
The clothes in the bag...

18:14.048 --> 18:16.092
..they all belong to your mystery man.

18:20.028 --> 18:21.068
His name was Daniel.

18:22.080 --> 18:27.008
Sandy, I need some information about

18:27.008 --> 18:30.048
this clothes shop in Nigeria.

18:30.048 --> 18:34.040
I need to know if they made a
suit for somebody named Daniel

18:34.040 --> 18:35.088
and, if they did, when?

18:39.072 --> 18:41.004
I like a challenge.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.000
Hello.

18:47.004 --> 18:49.000
I'll get Inspector Perez.

18:53.064 --> 18:54.084
Miss Lennox?

18:56.076 --> 18:59.076
I understand that you have
some information regarding

18:59.076 --> 19:02.076
the young man's remains
that we found, is that right?

19:04.064 --> 19:06.068
It's my boy.

19:06.068 --> 19:08.044
Your son?

19:08.044 --> 19:11.028
Daniel, it's my Dan.

19:14.072 --> 19:16.068
I'm sorry, are you sure?

19:16.068 --> 19:19.064
Well, I wouldn't be here otherwise,
would I?

19:22.084 --> 19:28.004
That's Daniel with his sister Zezi.

19:33.096 --> 19:36.032
May I make a copy of this? Yeah.

19:39.020 --> 19:40.096
Can I see him?

19:40.096 --> 19:43.044
There's no need for
identification purposes.

19:43.044 --> 19:45.008
We can take a DNA swab from you.

19:45.008 --> 19:47.000
No, I want to see him.

19:48.084 --> 19:51.004
I don't think that's a good idea.

19:54.076 --> 19:57.016
Why?

19:57.016 --> 19:58.080
We only have part of him.

20:39.068 --> 20:42.020
I haven't seen him since he was little.

20:44.084 --> 20:47.028
Him and his sister live with their dad.

20:54.028 --> 20:56.004
Where was that?

20:57.076 --> 20:59.032
Nigeria.

21:06.084 --> 21:09.032
Look, I know this is really difficult,

21:09.032 --> 21:13.064
and I'm so sorry to have to ask you,

21:13.064 --> 21:17.036
but was he involved in drugs in any way?

21:19.044 --> 21:23.068
We just have to establish
what he was doing on Shetland.

21:34.024 --> 21:36.064
Knowing his dad, I doubt it.

21:41.036 --> 21:44.004
So you didn't stay in touch then?

21:50.076 --> 21:52.040
Who did this?

21:54.076 --> 21:56.048
Someone here?

22:02.076 --> 22:04.052
Yeah, it's possible.

22:20.080 --> 22:28.028
His name was Daniel Ugara, he
was 21, from Lagos in Nigeria.

22:28.028 --> 22:32.032
Tosh, check his social media,
e-mail accounts, all of that.

22:32.032 --> 22:35.048
Sandy, check his mobile phone
records, see what you come up with.

22:35.048 --> 22:37.044
Are we thinking he was a
drugs courier?

22:37.044 --> 22:39.044
It's a possibility, but
let's keep an open mind.

22:39.044 --> 22:42.028
Because if he was bringing anything
in, it'd be good to know who for.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.096
Yes, but just remember he's a
victim in this case, not a suspect, OK?

22:59.056 --> 23:01.068
Prentice, how you doing?

23:01.068 --> 23:03.016
Fancy a pint?

23:03.016 --> 23:05.080
Oh, I'd love to, mate, but I
need to get this stuff packed up

23:05.080 --> 23:07.068
and get up the road.

23:07.068 --> 23:10.092
Maybe later? Leave it.

23:10.092 --> 23:13.060
We need to have a chin-wag.

23:13.060 --> 23:15.092
Aye? What about?

23:16.092 --> 23:20.020
You know what about.

23:20.020 --> 23:22.044
See you in the pub.

23:22.044 --> 23:24.040
Don't make me wait too long.

23:54.048 --> 23:55.096
How you doing?I'm all right.

23:55.096 --> 23:57.044
Nice to see you.Yeah, you, too.

23:57.044 --> 24:00.028
Where's your lunch? Oh, I
had a really big breakfast.

24:03.056 --> 24:06.000
Are you sure you don't want
half? No, I'm good, honestly.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.068
It beats what they serve
in the canteen.

24:10.004 --> 24:12.004
Can I be nosey?

24:12.004 --> 24:15.072
What's with that hut on the side
- high voltage on the door?

24:16.092 --> 24:20.036
Why do you want to know
about that? Just seems odd.

24:20.036 --> 24:22.068
If it's dangerous,
it should be fenced off.

24:22.068 --> 24:26.008
Nobody seems to go in
there, except the supervisor.

24:27.024 --> 24:29.072
Why does it have two
separate pipes running from it?

24:29.072 --> 24:32.080
Honestly, Tosh, I just come
in, stick my headphones on,

24:32.080 --> 24:36.020
turn up my music and get to work.
- Mags?

24:39.040 --> 24:43.000
I have noticed that, whenever
the Super goes in there,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.028
the tank room fills up

24:45.028 --> 24:48.032
even though the silo is empty.

24:48.032 --> 24:51.044
OK, say that again and imagine
you're talking to an idiot.

24:51.044 --> 24:55.020
If there's no fish in the
silo and the tank fills up,

24:55.020 --> 24:58.008
then it's coming from somewhere else.

24:58.008 --> 25:01.068
So there's always rumours that
some fishermen try to beat the quota,

25:01.068 --> 25:04.092
but everything that's landed
is weighed. You'd have to fix

25:04.092 --> 25:08.036
the scales, then everybody at the
plant would have to be involved.

25:08.036 --> 25:12.028
But if there was another pipe
that bypassed the scales and silo...

25:12.028 --> 25:13.092
OK, is there?

25:13.092 --> 25:16.052
From the way Mags
described it, there could be.

25:16.052 --> 25:19.048
And the valve that switches the fish
supply from one pipe to the other

25:19.048 --> 25:21.084
is probably in the mysterious

25:21.084 --> 25:24.012
"dangerous but apparently
not that dangerous" hut.

25:24.012 --> 25:27.004
Why would Daniel come
all the way from Nigeria

25:27.004 --> 25:30.020
to get involved in a quota scam here?

25:30.020 --> 25:33.080
Undeclared fish worth millions?
It's got to be sold somewhere.

25:33.080 --> 25:36.088
Maybe he wasn't selling,
maybe he was buying.

25:39.016 --> 25:40.076
I'm not sure about that.

25:40.076 --> 25:44.044
I mean, let's not throw
it out completely though.

25:44.044 --> 25:49.044
Sandy, get me some background
information on Prentice Hayes.

25:50.044 --> 25:53.024
Ask about.

25:53.024 --> 25:55.076
I want to know what he's capable of.

26:03.008 --> 26:05.016
Are you sure you want to do this?

27:03.052 --> 27:08.024
We've been trying to get in
contact with the family in Nigeria,

27:08.024 --> 27:10.064
but we haven't had any luck yet.

27:10.064 --> 27:14.052
Do you have you any
contact details for his father?

27:14.052 --> 27:16.000
No.

27:18.084 --> 27:20.080
Can we stop? I need a drink.

27:56.012 --> 27:57.080
Thank you.

28:14.048 --> 28:20.008
I get the feeling that there's
something you're not telling me.

28:23.072 --> 28:25.012
And I need to hear it.

28:35.036 --> 28:37.096
Have you got kids? A daughter.

28:39.068 --> 28:41.052
She's left home now.

28:46.024 --> 28:49.060
You think I'm a shit
mother, don't you? I can tell.

28:54.096 --> 28:58.052
But I had Daniel when I was 17.

28:58.052 --> 29:00.088
Had his sister when I was 18.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.084
Their dad was older
- a student.

29:05.092 --> 29:07.096
Didn't last.

29:09.064 --> 29:15.068
Then social services got involved
- they said I was an unfit mother.

29:18.064 --> 29:22.008
I don't know what they was
expecting, I was only a kid myself.

29:26.020 --> 29:32.076
So... I decided they would be
better off in Nigeria with their dad.

29:32.076 --> 29:34.096
I thought they'd be safer there.

29:36.028 --> 29:38.000
Safe from what?

29:40.080 --> 29:44.028
He's dead, their dad.

29:44.028 --> 29:46.032
He died a couple of months ago.

29:47.092 --> 29:50.028
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

29:51.056 --> 29:52.096
I'm telling you now.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.068
How do you know that?

30:05.028 --> 30:08.044
Daniel contacted me last week.

30:12.088 --> 30:14.024
What did he say?

30:15.056 --> 30:16.072
He wanted money.

30:17.096 --> 30:22.004
I haven't got any. I don't
know why he thought I did.

30:22.004 --> 30:24.064
Barely getting by. I had to borrow
the money to come up here.

30:24.064 --> 30:26.000
How much money?

30:28.072 --> 30:30.048
30 grand.

30:32.068 --> 30:37.020
We agreed to meet, but
I... I couldn't. I couldn't.

30:40.088 --> 30:44.060
You didn't go?

30:44.060 --> 30:46.076
I didn't have anything to give him.

30:52.024 --> 30:54.076
I thought he was better off without me.

30:59.032 --> 31:01.080
But I was wrong.

31:02.088 --> 31:04.028
I know that now.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.004
Bad business.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.096
This body found up by the inlet?

31:28.096 --> 31:31.016
Got any idea what happened?

31:32.056 --> 31:33.096
We're working on it.

31:37.012 --> 31:42.004
I hope they'll be sending up
the heavy squad to sort it.

31:42.004 --> 31:44.008
It's bound to affect tourism.

31:44.008 --> 31:46.020
We all need to make a living, eh?

31:48.040 --> 31:51.044
You a relative?

31:51.044 --> 31:53.072
Who are you?

31:53.072 --> 31:58.016
Paul Kiernan. I run this place.

31:58.016 --> 32:00.040
Well, if it's tourism
you're worried about,

32:00.040 --> 32:03.016
a lick of paint would'nay hurt.

32:18.032 --> 32:21.000
Seriously, again?

32:22.068 --> 32:24.024
This time she means it.

32:29.036 --> 32:31.024
You got anything stronger?

32:37.008 --> 32:38.092
Say when.

32:43.016 --> 32:45.052
Sometime this week.

32:48.020 --> 32:51.032
I knew she was pissed
off, I mean, that's a given,

32:51.032 --> 32:54.072
that's a normal state of
affairs really, but this.

32:56.084 --> 32:58.072
She's met someone else.

32:58.072 --> 33:00.044
I'm sorry.

33:00.044 --> 33:02.040
And she's selling the house.

33:04.004 --> 33:06.044
Can she do that? It's in her name.

33:06.044 --> 33:09.016
And she's leaving
Shetland. What, with him?

33:09.016 --> 33:12.036
No, with the Big Top.
Aye, with him.

33:12.036 --> 33:13.088
Who?

33:13.088 --> 33:15.080
I don't know. I didn't ask.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.068
You didn't ask?

33:17.068 --> 33:18.092
Is that weird?

33:20.060 --> 33:22.040
I don't know what to say.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.004
I thought the two of you
were finally in a good place.

33:26.004 --> 33:30.060
Listen, can I just bunk here
for a few days?

33:30.060 --> 33:32.080
Just till I get somewhere sorted.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.076
What about one of your holiday lets?

33:34.076 --> 33:37.012
I need them full. I'm...

33:37.012 --> 33:38.076
I'm broke.

33:38.076 --> 33:41.036
This new bar idea has cleaned me
right out.

33:44.032 --> 33:45.060
Is it a problem?

33:46.076 --> 33:50.052
I don't know how much
more rejection I can take.

33:50.052 --> 33:53.044
Yeah, you can...
You can have Cassie's room

33:53.044 --> 33:55.092
until she comes home for the summer.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.084
Top man.

34:07.016 --> 34:09.016
You know the problem, Tosh?

34:09.016 --> 34:13.027
All the single men on
Shetland are single for a reason.

34:13.027 --> 34:16.076
Honestly, the well has run dry.

34:16.076 --> 34:18.043
We have to Tinder.

34:18.043 --> 34:21.024
Are you kidding? We
know everyone on Tinder.

34:21.024 --> 34:23.000
There might be some fresh meat.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.043
Well, you Tinder away.
I'm going to my bed.

34:32.080 --> 34:36.020
Tosh, isn't it? Oh, hi.

34:36.020 --> 34:40.000
It's Donnie. We met at
the exhibition opening

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
at the museum last year.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.016
I work at the plant with Mags.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.004
Oh, that's right.

34:46.004 --> 34:49.056
Oh, you don't remember, do
you? It's the story of my life.

34:49.056 --> 34:51.056
No, I do. You're the...

34:51.056 --> 34:54.016
Invisible Man, it would appear.

34:54.016 --> 34:56.004
So, how are you doing?

34:56.004 --> 34:59.032
Good, thanks. I've just been
stood up, so...

34:59.032 --> 35:02.008
Maybe she looked in and
saw you doing the crossword?

35:02.008 --> 35:03.060
No-one likes a swot.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.064
Oh, mind you, I bounce back
pretty quick.

35:05.064 --> 35:08.072
Can I get you both a drink? Erm...

35:08.072 --> 35:12.004
You're OK. I'm actually up early.

35:12.004 --> 35:15.068
Sorry. See you later.See you.

35:18.084 --> 35:20.068
Let's focus on the processing plant.

35:20.068 --> 35:23.000
I mean, these scams are worth millions.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.076
And Daniel must have
been there for a reason.

35:25.076 --> 35:27.004
I can't see one, yet.

35:28.032 --> 35:31.088
Well, let's bring in
Marine Scotland anyway.

35:31.088 --> 35:34.024
Their forensic accountants
can go through the books.

35:34.024 --> 35:36.028
Kill two birds with one stone.

35:38.012 --> 35:39.052
What it is?

35:40.072 --> 35:46.016
I just can't see someone being
hacked to death over black landing,

35:46.016 --> 35:48.068
I don't care how much money's involved.

35:48.068 --> 35:52.060
Gavin Laird has a lot to lose,
Jimmy. He owns that plant.

35:52.060 --> 35:54.048
People have killed for less.

35:54.048 --> 35:58.096
Look, we found traces
of cocaine in the hold-all

35:58.096 --> 36:01.096
that was used to dump Daniel's remains.

36:01.096 --> 36:05.048
The way in which they tried
to dispose of the body has all

36:05.048 --> 36:08.060
the hallmarks of drug traffickers.

36:08.060 --> 36:14.032
Oh, except they didn't do a
very professional job, did they?

36:14.032 --> 36:16.024
This is your investigation,

36:16.024 --> 36:19.040
just build me a case that
will stand up in court.

37:13.016 --> 37:18.004
Here you go, Rosie. Do
you think this is a charity?

37:18.004 --> 37:22.060
Where's our money?
There, take it. It's all there.

37:24.088 --> 37:27.016
Jamie, let's go.

37:27.016 --> 37:28.064
See ya, Rosie.See ya, Jamie.

37:51.012 --> 37:55.064
Hi, I'm DI Perez. Shetland Police.

37:56.092 --> 37:59.012
Mind if I have a quick word?

38:01.048 --> 38:05.000
No, sorry,
I haven't seen him around here.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.004
What's your name? Rosie.

38:09.008 --> 38:11.088
How long have you
been staying here, Rosie?

38:11.088 --> 38:14.012
About three weeks.

38:14.012 --> 38:16.092
I've got a job at the refinery,
in the canteen.

38:16.092 --> 38:18.028
She's the same.

38:19.092 --> 38:22.040
It's cheaper than a hotel and nearer.

38:24.052 --> 38:27.036
Carla Hayes own these
caravans, doesn't she?

38:27.036 --> 38:29.048
That's right.

38:29.048 --> 38:34.008
You're an awayday girl, aren't
you, Rosie? And so's your pal.

38:34.008 --> 38:35.084
No, we're not.

38:37.052 --> 38:40.060
But you know what an
awayday girl is? Aye.

38:40.060 --> 38:43.020
They come over on the ferry
to turn tricks.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.084
When they get enough
money, they go home.

38:48.072 --> 38:51.020
But that's not you? No.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.068
You sure you haven't seen him?

38:57.076 --> 38:59.096
Is that the man in the newspaper?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.032
That's right.

39:05.032 --> 39:09.000
Tell him, Rosie, he's doing us a favour.
- What?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.044
Tell him.
- I don't...

39:15.040 --> 39:19.028
He was here last week,
looking for a girl.

39:19.028 --> 39:22.084
Prentice told us not to
say anything about him.

39:22.084 --> 39:24.028
What girl?

39:24.028 --> 39:29.068
He didn't say, he just
asked who was staying here.

39:29.068 --> 39:32.020
We told him it was just us.

39:32.020 --> 39:36.056
Has Prentice got something to
do with this? He has, hasn't he?

39:36.056 --> 39:39.060
Look, I'm not gonna make
your situation any worse

39:39.060 --> 39:41.024
than it already is.

39:43.052 --> 39:48.044
If you want me to put you in touch
with a refuge, or call your family,

39:48.044 --> 39:54.052
or even if you just want somebody
to talk to, then you call me, OK?

40:23.084 --> 40:25.004
Billy? Boss.

40:25.004 --> 40:28.080
You know those caravans
up by the new pipeline? I do.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.084
Let Social Services know there's some
vulnerable young women up there, OK?

40:32.084 --> 40:34.008
Aye, no problem.

40:36.068 --> 40:39.000
It seems Daniel was up
there looking for a girl -

40:39.000 --> 40:40.048
I need to know who.

40:40.048 --> 40:42.032
So get Tosh to call me soon as,
all right?

40:42.032 --> 40:43.092
I'll let her know right away.

40:43.092 --> 40:46.048
Listen, I need to go. I've got
somebody right up my arse.

40:46.048 --> 40:47.088
Are you on your way back now?

40:51.064 --> 40:52.068
Boss?

40:55.028 --> 40:56.040
Jesus!

40:57.052 --> 41:01.004
Jimmy? Jimmy?

41:31.060 --> 41:33.076
I'm getting your car checked out.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.024
How's your head?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Sore.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.020
You thinking Prentice Hayes
has something to do with this?

41:42.020 --> 41:45.016
Could have been trying to
warn you off?

41:45.016 --> 41:47.024
If he is,
he's going to fuckin' regret it.

41:52.040 --> 41:56.004
She's been here for hours,
waiting for news.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.028
Right, Tosh, what have you got?

42:02.028 --> 42:06.060
Daniel's social media
- just photographs from uni, mostly.

42:16.092 --> 42:18.044
OK, enough, enough.

42:20.020 --> 42:22.048
He was looking for somebody.
Did he have a girlfriend?

42:22.048 --> 42:23.088
Not in a relationship.

42:23.088 --> 42:26.092
And nothing on here to indicate
that he was involved with drugs.

42:26.092 --> 42:31.020
Mind you, I don't suppose Pablo
Escobar's Facebook page did either.

42:31.020 --> 42:32.068
I got Daniel's phone records.

42:32.068 --> 42:35.084
He didn't make many calls,
internet mostly, but he did receive

42:35.084 --> 42:39.020
a few from different cities all over
- Madrid, Amsterdam.

42:39.020 --> 42:41.084
Anything local? Calum
Dunwoody, Prentice Hayes?

42:41.084 --> 42:43.000
Not that I can see, no.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.056
Data's encrypted. The tech
boys are talking to the carrier,

42:45.056 --> 42:47.016
they'll get us it as soon as they can.

42:47.016 --> 42:48.032
Look at this.

42:48.032 --> 42:51.020
Seems Prentice Hayes is pretty
active on social media himself.

42:51.020 --> 42:54.016
That's him with Calum Dunwoody
at Up Helly Aa two years ago.

42:55.044 --> 42:56.072
Let's go.

44:52.060 --> 44:54.052
What do you use this tank for?

44:57.084 --> 45:00.016
We get rid of animal carcasses
in there.

45:00.016 --> 45:01.028
Do you dissolve them?

45:03.004 --> 45:04.052
Don't get ahead of yourself.

45:07.040 --> 45:11.016
Sandy, there's traces of
blood and tissue in this tank.

45:11.016 --> 45:14.040
Get the forensics team over
here to check for Daniel's DNA.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.084
Will do, but we've got a problem.

45:18.044 --> 45:21.004
Get out of my way! I just
want to know what's going on!

45:21.004 --> 45:23.092
You lost? Wee bit far
from home, are you no?

45:23.092 --> 45:25.036
You laughing at me?

45:25.036 --> 45:27.088
Olivia, wait, wait, wait!
What are you doing here?

45:27.088 --> 45:30.092
You found something, didn't you?
I can't talk to you about that!

45:30.092 --> 45:33.056
Go back to your hotel and wait there.

45:33.056 --> 45:35.040
I just want to know how my boy died!

45:35.040 --> 45:39.096
I know, I know you do, but
this could be a crime scene,

45:39.096 --> 45:41.076
so you can't be here now.

45:49.068 --> 45:51.060
Wait, I'll give you a lift
back to Lerwick.

45:51.060 --> 45:53.032
I thought you were going to help me.

45:53.032 --> 45:56.044
I am, but that has to work both ways.

45:57.080 --> 46:02.012
You're just... you're... you're
getting in the way here.

46:02.012 --> 46:04.076
Thing is, this is an island, right?
And you all know each other?

46:04.076 --> 46:06.020
OK, so what do you mean by that?

46:06.020 --> 46:08.028
What, you think that I
would turn a blind eye

46:08.028 --> 46:09.072
to what happened to your boy?

46:09.072 --> 46:13.008
All I'm saying is you all look out
for each other, yeah? Oh, no.

46:13.008 --> 46:15.036
Let's just get one thing
straight. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

46:15.036 --> 46:17.084
Let's just get the one thing straight.

46:17.084 --> 46:20.064
I don't turn a blind eye to anything.

46:23.076 --> 46:27.092
I need the air. I'll walk. Thanks.

46:31.008 --> 46:32.056
It's going to take you hours.

46:36.020 --> 46:37.044
Hours!

47:03.028 --> 47:06.076
Ah, hello. I bring gifts.

47:06.076 --> 47:08.024
Then you are welcome.

47:14.020 --> 47:16.076
One Hundred Years Of Solitude?
Right, OK.

47:16.076 --> 47:19.064
Yeah, well, for some
reason, I thought of you.

47:19.064 --> 47:22.044
You've been on your own too long,
Jimmy, you're beginning to like it.

47:22.044 --> 47:25.040
Hey, have you nothing
better to worry about?

47:25.040 --> 47:28.068
A million things,
but you're top of my list.

47:28.068 --> 47:31.076
You have to eat your ice
cream before it melts.

47:31.076 --> 47:33.060
So you're saying I'm past it?

47:33.060 --> 47:35.020
No, I just don't want you to end up

47:35.020 --> 47:37.064
like some Shetland
equivalent to Miss Havisham.

47:37.064 --> 47:39.076
That's how...?
That's how you see me, is it?

47:42.096 --> 47:46.044
Well, you're behind the curve
- my days of solitude are over.

47:48.092 --> 47:50.044
Duncan's moved in.

47:52.044 --> 47:54.088
They haven't split up,
have they? And then some.

47:56.056 --> 47:58.072
It's not easy, is it, marriage?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.052
Maybe you have the right idea.

48:04.016 --> 48:05.092
You and Chris OK?

48:05.092 --> 48:08.068
Yeah. It's not perfect, but yeah.

48:10.072 --> 48:12.092
Don't worry - you won't have
me and Duncan living here.

48:12.092 --> 48:14.060
It's not an epidemic.

48:14.060 --> 48:16.016
Shit, I'd better go.

48:16.016 --> 48:17.048
Read that.

48:17.048 --> 48:19.040
OK. You'll like it.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.052
See you later.Bye.

48:48.064 --> 48:52.060
Daniel, give them what they
want, please!

48:54.004 --> 48:57.020
Just give them what
they want. They'll kill me!

48:57.020 --> 48:58.072
Please find a way!

49:12.076 --> 49:14.092
- Tosh?
- Sir, there's something you need to see.

49:21.040 --> 49:24.044
Blood traces for the Hayes yard
- roadkill right enough.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.064
OK. Thanks, Sandy.
What have you got, Tosh?

49:29.012 --> 49:30.072
Found this in Daniel's inbox.

49:30.072 --> 49:34.056
Daniel, give them what they want, please!

49:36.004 --> 49:39.068
Just give them what
they want, they'll kill me!

49:39.068 --> 49:40.092
Please find a way!

50:00.064 --> 50:03.064
That's her. It's his sister.

50:07.056 --> 50:11.052
Olivia, I have something to show you.

50:12.084 --> 50:15.064
I think it's your daughter.
Are you OK with that?

50:22.092 --> 50:25.092
Is that Zezi? Where did you get this?

50:25.092 --> 50:27.040
It was sent to Daniel.

50:28.036 --> 50:30.008
That's who he was looking for.

50:30.008 --> 50:32.016
I know, but she's in Lagos.

50:32.016 --> 50:36.012
There's a possibility that she's
being held somewhere else

50:36.012 --> 50:42.008
against her will, so if you
have any information at all...

50:42.008 --> 50:46.000
Here? Oh, she's... she's
in Shetland? She's here?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.068
No, right now, I don't know where she is.

50:52.076 --> 50:56.000
Well, I tell you what
- instead of judging me,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.008
why don't you imagine that
is your girl in that picture

50:59.008 --> 51:01.008
and you go and find her?

51:08.088 --> 51:10.064
Olivia, can I have a second?

51:12.024 --> 51:13.028
Um...

51:17.032 --> 51:20.096
This is my number,
if you ever want to talk.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.080
About what?

51:24.080 --> 51:26.092
About whatever it is
that happened to you.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.096
Excuse me?

51:34.000 --> 51:37.052
I'm just saying, no-one's
blaming you for any of this,

51:37.052 --> 51:39.024
so you shouldn't blame yourself.

51:40.076 --> 51:42.028
I'm not.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.072
Billy, can you request a copy of
Olivia Lennox's social work file for me?

51:57.072 --> 51:59.028
Aye. No problem.

51:59.028 --> 52:00.068
Thank you.

52:04.004 --> 52:06.028
Give them what they want, please!

52:06.028 --> 52:08.060
Just give them what they want.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.096
They'll kill me!

52:09.096 --> 52:11.036
Please find a way!

52:15.068 --> 52:17.060
And you think that was filmed here?

52:17.060 --> 52:19.096
Well, Daniel came here to
find his sister,

52:19.096 --> 52:23.040
so I think it's safe to assume
it was, Rhona.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.076
By who, the Hayes?

52:25.076 --> 52:28.040
There's no way Carla would be
involved in something like this!

52:28.040 --> 52:30.020
No?

52:30.020 --> 52:34.008
Well, Prentice Hayes is renting
caravans to awayday girls

52:34.008 --> 52:35.084
up by the new pipeline.

52:35.084 --> 52:39.008
Which might explain why Daniel
wrote pipeline in that notepad.

52:43.048 --> 52:48.092
I've known Carla for 15
years. This is not her, trust me.

52:53.044 --> 52:54.088
OK.

52:54.088 --> 52:56.044
Get your overtime claims in now

52:56.044 --> 52:59.068
because there's no more time
off until we find Daniel's killer

52:59.068 --> 53:01.044
and whoever's holding his sister.

53:20.016 --> 53:21.092
Daniel, give them what they want, please!

53:21.092 --> 53:24.068
She could be dead already.

53:24.068 --> 53:27.040
I mean, they're not going to
get their money now, are they?

53:27.040 --> 53:28.044
We don't know that.

53:28.044 --> 53:30.096
They'll kill me! Please find a way!

53:33.036 --> 53:34.088
Play that again.

53:37.064 --> 53:41.080
Daniel, give them what they want, please!

53:43.008 --> 53:45.016
Just give them what they want.

53:45.016 --> 53:47.016
Can you hear that? Is that music?

53:47.016 --> 53:48.020
Please find a way!

53:49.040 --> 53:51.092
Sandy, can you isolate the background?

53:51.092 --> 53:53.044
Can we do that?

53:53.044 --> 53:56.076
I can lose everything except the background.

54:09.052 --> 54:12.068
That's the song that was playing
in the bar at the Macbay Hotel.

54:17.036 --> 54:18.040
Let's go.

56:43.048 --> 56:46.016
She was here. We missed her.

56:48.044 --> 56:49.092
This isn't about drugs.

56:51.016 --> 56:53.040
It's people, Tosh
- they're selling people.
