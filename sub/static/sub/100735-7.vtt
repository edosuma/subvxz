WEBVTT

01:14.992 --> 01:16.368
So you think I'll win?

01:19.371 --> 01:22.749
Be surprised if you didn't. This is your first murder, right?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.084
It's that obvious?

01:24.168 --> 01:26.503
No, no, you're doing great. It's really well, yeah.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.548
I really appreciate you taking the time here.

01:29.631 --> 01:34.344
Oh, come on, come on. Actually I... took some notes.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.597
If you want.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.558
Yeah. Great. Sure.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.560
So...

01:42.936 --> 01:44.855
-All right, your opening argument... -Okay.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.191
You didn't look at him, the defendant.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.193
-I didn't? -No.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.819
And I'm not talking about a passing glance.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.738
You gotta show the jury that you can look at a defendant

01:52.821 --> 01:54.823
right in the eye and say, "Guilty."

01:54.907 --> 01:57.451
If you show them that you have the courage to do that, so will they.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.745
Okay. That's great.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.289
What else?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.167
I noticed you kinda stand far away from the jury box.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.002
You always wanna be closing that space.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.753
Makes the jurors feel like you're one of them.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.632
You... you said the name of the defendant four times.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.342
I shouldn't do that?

02:13.425 --> 02:16.845
As far as you're concerned, he doesn't have a name. He's the defendant.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.139
His lawyer's gonna be doing everything he can to humanize him.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.599
Don't make the job any easier.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.934
Another round?

02:22.017 --> 02:24.978
-No, that's okay. -Yes. Absolutely.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.564
Come on. It's on me.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.360
You really think I'm gonna win?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.759
Now, Jacob, I know I've told you this before...

03:52.024 --> 03:53.650
Court, all rise.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.069
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.239
All persons having anything to do before the Honorable Judge French,

03:59.323 --> 04:01.366
a Justice of the Superior Court,

04:01.450 --> 04:03.118
now sitting within and for the Commonwealth,

04:03.202 --> 04:05.954
draw near, give your attendance, and you shall be heard.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.124
God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and this most honorable court.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.043
This court's now open. Please be seated.

04:14.379 --> 04:19.593
Number 08-44-07, Commonwealth versus Jacob Owen Barber.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.803
A single count of murder in the first degree.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.555
For the defendant, Joanna Klein.

04:24.056 --> 04:27.434
For the Commonwealth, Assistant District Attorney Neal Logiudice.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.313
Any preliminary motions before we begin the voir dire?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.148
A couple of things, yes, Your Honor.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.943
First, the defendant's father, Andrew Barber,

04:36.026 --> 04:40.239
would like to enter an appearance in the case on the defendant's behalf.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.242
With the court's permission, he's going to second chair me at trial.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.327
Is this a wise decision, Ms. Klein?

04:45.744 --> 04:47.788
It is the family's wish, Your Honor.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.334
All right, Mr. Barber, you can come forward. What else?

04:52.417 --> 04:55.003
Your Honor, I have filed a motion in limine

04:55.087 --> 04:58.465
to exclude any mention of the defendant's grandfather William Barber,

04:58.549 --> 05:01.802
who is currently serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.

05:01.885 --> 05:06.056
We believe the Commonwealth may try to introduce this fact to prejudice the jury.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.891
Your Honor, the Commonwealth contends

05:07.975 --> 05:11.061
that the family's history of violence is of great relevance.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.981
Your Honor, my client has never once met the--

05:14.064 --> 05:16.108
I get it. I read the motion.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.447
Defendant's objection is noted and tabled.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.157
Should the Commonwealth decide

05:24.241 --> 05:27.077
William Barber's criminal record is critical to his case,

05:27.160 --> 05:30.998
he will first notify the defense, and then we'll have a hearing on the matter.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.834
Otherwise, not a word about this to the jury.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.252
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.087
Yes, Your Honor.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.716
Lastly, the defense moves to expand its witness list by two:

05:40.799 --> 05:43.969
Matthew McGrath and Leonard Patz.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.513
-Commonwealth? -We're fine with it, Your Honor.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.765
All right, let's bring in the jury venire.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.726
All rise for the jury.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.621
Retired bus driver, works with kids. That's good.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.581
Yeah, I liked her. Thanks, Ellen.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.085
They kept staring at me.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.879
You'll get used to that.

06:19.588 --> 06:23.967
Just keep your eye on the judge as much as possible-- or on your dad and me.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.012
Don't give 'em any reason to not like you. No faces. Okay?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.014
You're doing great so far.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.724
You all are.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.605
You see, this wasn't just an average boy, the defendant.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.484
No, something set him apart.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.529
His father.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.865
A father who was the first assistant district attorney.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.076
Top man, right here in this building.

06:50.786 --> 06:54.081
For years, the defendant watched his father

06:54.164 --> 06:57.459
prosecute every major murder case in this county.

06:57.543 --> 07:02.965
He listened to dinner conversations. Overheard phone calls, shop talk.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.219
You might even say that murder was the family business.

07:09.221 --> 07:12.015
But still, the question remains: "Why?"

07:14.601 --> 07:15.894
Why...

07:16.979 --> 07:20.399
would an eighth-grade boy kill his classmate?

07:22.317 --> 07:25.153
Well, we've all been to school.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.241
We know kids can be mean.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.372
You're gonna hear testimony that the victim in this case,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.125
Ben Rifkin, teased the defendant.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.296
Nothing shocking, but still, mean.

07:43.172 --> 07:47.217
Ben foolishly mocked this young man,

07:47.968 --> 07:53.265
unaware of his hidden capacity, even desire, to kill.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.391
Objection.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.517
Sustained.

07:55.601 --> 07:59.563
The jury will disregard the last remark about the defendant's desire,

07:59.646 --> 08:01.315
which is speculation.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.109
And so, on April 12,

08:04.193 --> 08:07.821
the defendant walked into the woods of Cold Spring Park

08:07.905 --> 08:12.034
with a knife in his pocket and an idea in his mind.

08:13.035 --> 08:16.914
Did he ambush the victim, or were there words exchanged first?

08:18.207 --> 08:21.668
Maybe Ben called him a name.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.338
Or even threatened him.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.715
We don't know.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.093
All we know

08:30.177 --> 08:35.974
is that the defendant punched his knife three times into Ben Rifkin's chest,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.143
killing him.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.688
Three...

08:42.773 --> 08:46.527
evenly spaced wounds.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.364
One.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.450
Two.

08:55.494 --> 08:56.745
Three.

08:59.623 --> 09:05.420
You see a tragedy as enormous as this, and it makes you furious.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.590
You want someone to pay.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.968
I do too. I do.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.637
It's only human.

09:15.222 --> 09:19.059
But Jacob Barber is innocent.

09:20.227 --> 09:24.606
And I want to say that again so that there is no misunderstanding.

09:25.274 --> 09:30.571
Jacob Barber is wholly and completely innocent.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.951
When you understand what really happened that day,

09:36.910 --> 09:41.790
you'll see this case for what it is-- a rush to judgment.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.085
The fingerprint, for example,

09:45.169 --> 09:47.462
that the prosecution made such a big deal about,

09:47.546 --> 09:49.756
you're going to hear how that print got there

09:49.840 --> 09:53.260
just as Jacob told the police officer who arrested him

09:53.343 --> 09:55.262
the moment that he was asked.

09:56.430 --> 10:00.475
He saw his classmate lying on the ground, and he tried to help.

10:01.393 --> 10:07.274
And when he discovered that Ben was dead, saw all that blood, he panicked.

10:07.357 --> 10:12.279
He feared that if he told someone about the body, he'd become a suspect.

10:12.362 --> 10:16.241
After all, this was Ben Rifkin, the boy who bullied him.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.328
Everyone knew that. How would it look?

10:20.537 --> 10:26.502
Does Jacob wish that he had been braver from the start and told the truth?

10:27.419 --> 10:29.129
Of course he does.

10:29.213 --> 10:33.800
It was the worst mistake he's ever made. It was a horrible, terrifying mistake.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.970
But he was a boy.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.391
And I don't give a damn how the state chooses to try him.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.686
He was a 14-year-old boy.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.148
And boys make mistakes.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.528
But we are adults...

10:54.071 --> 10:57.074
with a grave responsibility before us.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.952
A child is dead.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.873
Don't destroy another child's life to make up for it.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.668
That isn't justice.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.421
That's just another tragedy.

11:21.807 --> 11:22.891
Mr. Barber, over here!

11:22.975 --> 11:24.560
Mr. Barber, you have any comment?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.353
Give us a little room here, please.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.146
Give us a little room here.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.443
Mr. Barber, do you feel he's guilty?

11:34.319 --> 11:35.654
Hey, come over here, please.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.409
It's definitely the same guy.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.079
Yes, I'm sure. Blue Lincoln.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.957
Right.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.585
You still have that plate number I sent you?

11:52.254 --> 11:53.255
Okay.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.008
Thanks, Duff.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.552
What was that about?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.929
Long story. I'll tell you later.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.016
Okay, well, make sure they get some rest.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.310
-I'll call you tonight. -Okay.

12:20.908 --> 12:21.909
Driver's license.

12:22.951 --> 12:23.952
What I do?

12:24.036 --> 12:25.704
Let me see your license.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.707
I got a right to sit in my own car, don't I?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.586
Sir, are you refusing to provide me with identification?

12:33.003 --> 12:34.421
I'm not refusing anything.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.216
I wanna know what you're bothering me for.

12:57.528 --> 13:00.781
The family declined making any statement when leaving the courthouse today.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.032
And by all indications,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.701
plan to spend their night here at their home in Newton.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.662
What happens tomorrow is anyone's guess.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.664
However, opening statements suggest

13:08.747 --> 13:10.958
we could be in for an emotionally charged trial.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.043
This is Alix Wong, Channel 12 News.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.351
Just got off the phone with Duffy.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.313
It's not good. Just hear me out.

14:14.396 --> 14:15.522
What?

14:15.606 --> 14:18.233
His name is James O'Leary, the guy in the Lincoln.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.860
They call him Father O'Leary.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.486
They?

14:21.570 --> 14:23.238
I guess he's an old gangster.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.241
He's got a record. Duffy said he used to be some sort of muscle.

14:26.325 --> 14:29.077
Now he hires himself out to do, you know, small things,

14:29.161 --> 14:30.871
roughing people up, that sort of thing.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.082
Are you kidding me? What does he want with us?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.292
I don't know.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.962
What are we supposed to do? Can't they arrest him? Question him?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.381
Not unless he explicitly threatens us.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.383
Oh, my God.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.595
Duffy said she's gonna keep an eye on him. I know it doesn't sound good,

14:46.678 --> 14:49.223
but odds are it's probably just someone trying to scare us.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.266
Because we're not scared enough already.

14:57.439 --> 15:01.693
My heart was kind of pounding then, because he wasn't answering me.

15:01.777 --> 15:05.614
Still, I couldn't see how he looked until I got close.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.158
And did you call for help?

15:08.825 --> 15:12.162
I remember crawling backwards up the slope, dialing 911.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.207
Thank you, Mrs. Gianetto.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.334
Ms. Klein.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.919
No questions, Your Honor.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.547
The dog park, yes.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.923
What time was this?

15:23.632 --> 15:24.967
Around 8:00 a.m.

15:25.717 --> 15:29.179
Like I said, it sounded like a boy's voice I heard.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.850
He said, "Stop. You're hurting me."

15:33.642 --> 15:35.143
"Stop. You're hurting me."

15:37.896 --> 15:40.691
Could you tell what direction the boy's voice came from?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.069
West, I think.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.698
Detective, is it standard procedure

15:47.781 --> 15:51.243
for an assistant district attorney to direct a homicide investigation?

15:51.994 --> 15:52.995
Yes.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.497
And who was the assistant DA assigned to the case that day?

15:55.581 --> 15:56.957
Objection. Relevance.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.877
See counsel at sidebar.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.967
Your Honor, I don't see how Mr. Barber's brief involvement in this case

16:07.050 --> 16:09.261
has anything to do with his son's innocence or guilt.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.681
Your Honor, the jury is entitled to hear that the defendant's own father

16:12.764 --> 16:15.100
was in charge of the early stages of the investigation.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.813
I'm going to allow it, but I warn you, counselor.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.691
Mr. Barber is not on trial here. Remember that.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.360
Yes, Your Honor. Understood.

16:26.445 --> 16:27.905
Witness will answer the question.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.284
Andrew Barber was in charge.

16:33.827 --> 16:37.539
And did you find it strange that Mr. Barber was handling a case

16:37.623 --> 16:39.499
that involved his own son's classmate?

16:40.209 --> 16:41.585
Not really, no.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.213
And once his son was charged with the murder?

16:44.713 --> 16:45.839
Any concerns?

16:47.049 --> 16:48.717
I wasn't happy about it.

16:49.343 --> 16:52.429
Detective, have you ever heard of a prosecutor

16:52.513 --> 16:55.390
being involved in the investigation into his own child?

16:55.474 --> 16:57.100
-Objection. -Sustained.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.102
You've made your point, counselor. Let's move it along.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.772
No further questions, Your Honor.

17:03.649 --> 17:04.733
Ms. Klein.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.945
Detective Peterson, you were among the first at the crime scene.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.990
-Was there a murder weapon found that day? -No, ma'am.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.243
Besides a single fingerprint found on the victim's sweatshirt,

17:15.327 --> 17:17.412
was there any evidence recovered that day?

17:17.496 --> 17:18.622
No.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.501
And of course, the fingerprint wasn't identified until later. Yes?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.002
Yes. Correct.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.964
So is it fair to say that at the beginning of the investigation,

17:27.047 --> 17:31.051
neither you nor Mr. Barber had any obvious suspects?

17:31.134 --> 17:32.135
We did not.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.055
And was the defendant the first suspect to emerge?

17:35.973 --> 17:38.684
-No. We initially just-- -Objection. Relevance?

17:41.019 --> 17:42.020
Overruled.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.649
We initially pursued a suspect named Leonard Patz.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.486
He had a record for indecent assault and battery on kids, things like that.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.864
So a registered sex offender,

17:51.947 --> 17:54.074
and that's what made him a person of interest?

17:54.157 --> 17:56.076
That, and he lived near the park.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.661
He didn't just live near the park.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.831
He was known to walk in the park most mornings. Isn't that true?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.708
Objection. Leading the witness.

18:02.791 --> 18:03.834
Overruled.

18:04.585 --> 18:08.422
Yes. In fact, he admitted to being in the park that same morning.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.967
No more questions. Thank you.

18:13.051 --> 18:18.098
Detective, whose idea was it to pursue the investigation into Leonard Patz?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.644
Andy Barber brought it to my attention.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.480
Andy Barber. I see.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.692
And Mr. Patz was then cleared

18:28.775 --> 18:31.361
when Mr. Barber's own son was charged with the crime.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.364
Yes.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.866
No further questions, Your Honor.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.205
-Your Honor, we'd like to recross. -Go ahead.

18:43.123 --> 18:47.711
Detective, when Mr. Logiudice asked if you had cleared Leonard Patz,

18:47.794 --> 18:50.130
were you certain of his innocence?

18:50.214 --> 18:51.840
Certain? No.

18:51.924 --> 18:56.053
Did you agree with Mr. Barber's decision to investigate Leonard Patz?

18:56.512 --> 18:58.222
Yes. Absolutely.

18:58.305 --> 19:01.558
What about other decisions Andy Barber made?

19:01.642 --> 19:02.851
Any concerns at all?

19:03.393 --> 19:04.811
None I can think of.

19:05.646 --> 19:06.855
He's the best they got.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.067
The best they used to have, anyway.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.112
Thank you, Detective. No further questions.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.741
Commonwealth, you prepared to call your next witness?

19:19.910 --> 19:21.245
Yes, Your Honor.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.792
The beam refracts through each slit

19:26.875 --> 19:29.378
and makes a pattern of light and dark stripes on the other side.

19:29.461 --> 19:33.799
Why? Because light isn't made of particles, but...

19:33.882 --> 19:35.008
-Waves? -Exactly.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.678
And it is the intersection of the waves that make the patterns.

19:38.262 --> 19:41.223
So these physicists decide that they're gonna solve what's going on

19:41.306 --> 19:44.768
by installing a device that allows them to see

19:44.852 --> 19:48.689
exactly which slit each electron is passing through.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.567
Only the moment that they try to observe it,

19:51.650 --> 19:56.154
the electrons stop behaving like waves and behave like particles again.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.990
What? That's impossible.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.284
-Google it. -I'll be right back.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.369
I tell my wife it's exactly like me and the Celtics.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.538
The moment I turn on the game, they lose.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.583
What the hell did I say about calling here?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.127
I just want to know how it's going.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.295
What?

20:11.795 --> 20:13.505
What do you mean, "What"? The trial.

20:13.589 --> 20:15.841
He's my grandson. I got a right to know.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.259
Listen to me very carefully.

20:17.342 --> 20:20.262
You don't have a right to shit. Okay?

20:20.345 --> 20:23.724
Maybe I got a right to call one of these reporters that keeps trying me, huh?

20:24.099 --> 20:25.100
Do whatever you want.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.060
Come on. I just wanna know what are you thinking.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.812
I mean, what's your strategy?

20:28.896 --> 20:32.191
I'm watching it all day on the news here. I think the kid's got a chance.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.776
But you know you gotta be smart about this.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.197
Oh, yeah? I didn't know they gave out law degrees in prison.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.533
That's funny. You think prison's a fucking joke?

20:43.327 --> 20:44.536
Let me tell you something.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.873
This is sure as hell no place for a kid like Jacob.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.793
Now one of the witnesses today,

20:51.877 --> 20:53.253
this cop who was on the stand,

20:54.129 --> 20:55.923
he mentioned this guy Patz.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.341
What about him?

20:57.758 --> 20:59.301
Well, you think he did it?

21:01.512 --> 21:03.597
-Do you? -Yeah.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.183
Are you sure?

21:06.725 --> 21:07.809
Look, I gotta go.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.895
Guy's a child molester, right?

21:11.313 --> 21:12.523
Sort of.

21:12.898 --> 21:15.442
How the fuck are you "sort of" a child molester?

21:15.901 --> 21:19.071
Same way you were a murderer before you actually murdered someone.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.864
Why you gotta make it about me?

21:20.948 --> 21:23.325
Why don't you fucking quit worrying about what I am

21:23.408 --> 21:25.744
and start worrying about my grandson?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.246
Don't call here again.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.748
I mean it. You keep him out of this place!

21:29.831 --> 21:31.124
You hear me?

21:31.208 --> 21:33.210
I spent my whole fucking life in this shithole.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.838
I'm not gonna stand by while my grandson's life--

21:36.880 --> 21:38.048
You mother--

21:38.131 --> 21:39.675
You fucked up, cocksucker.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.066
-Did Joanna leave? -Yeah.

21:56.775 --> 21:58.277
Who was that?

21:58.360 --> 22:02.114
Oh, it was... credit card company, just confirming some charges.

22:04.825 --> 22:07.703
Joanna seemed... optimistic.

22:08.537 --> 22:11.164
You know, I'm starting to think she should be.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.673
So weird, 'cause there were just all these people there.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.216
I don't even know why, because it was so cold outside.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.093
-Hey. -Hold on one second.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.720
I'm just hanging these on your door.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.221
Okay. Thanks.

22:26.889 --> 22:27.973
Who are you talking to?

22:28.515 --> 22:29.433
Sarah.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.186
Okay.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.605
-Tell her I said hi. -Okay.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.357
Sorry about that.

22:37.441 --> 22:40.152
So anyway, this lady comes in with her kids, right?

22:40.235 --> 22:42.738
And they're just so loud and obnoxious.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.866
And I was like, "Oh, my gosh. Shut up already." But...

22:53.123 --> 22:55.209
You've been with the state's crime lab how long?

22:55.292 --> 22:57.419
Eleven years, almost 12.

22:58.212 --> 23:02.382
Ms. Carlson, could you describe the blood evidence at the point of attack?

23:02.466 --> 23:05.761
There were a few small spatters less than an inch in diameter.

23:05.844 --> 23:07.429
Yesterday, we heard defense contend

23:07.513 --> 23:10.641
that there should have been blood on the clothing of an attacker

23:10.724 --> 23:12.518
in a stabbing like this.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.394
-Do you have an opinion on that? -Yes.

23:14.478 --> 23:18.899
That's not necessarily true, since no spatter seemed cast off with force.

23:18.982 --> 23:22.694
It's also possible the assailant stood behind the victim when he stabbed him,

23:22.778 --> 23:26.323
which would have meant he was out of the trajectory of any spray or spatter.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.951
What can you tell us about the murder weapon?

23:29.034 --> 23:33.914
We were looking for a knife with a four- to six-inch blade and a serrated edge.

23:34.665 --> 23:35.749
I see.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.837
So, a knife like this one?

23:40.963 --> 23:41.964
Objection.

23:42.047 --> 23:43.382
Commonwealth moves to enter into evidence--

23:43.465 --> 23:44.675
Objection!

23:45.175 --> 23:47.636
Your Honor, the jury will soon hear testimony

23:47.719 --> 23:49.263
from the defendant's best friend

23:49.346 --> 23:52.432
that the defendant owned a knife exactly like this one:

23:52.516 --> 23:53.725
a Schnell Tactical.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.936
Your Honor, this is a cheap stunt.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.815
The Commonwealth has yet to link any such knife to the defendant,

23:59.898 --> 24:03.735
and to wave it around in here now is irresponsible. It's inflammatory.

24:03.819 --> 24:07.197
Agreed. Objection sustained. Put away the knife, Mr. Logiudice.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.409
In that case, no more questions, Your Honor.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.202
Cross.

24:12.286 --> 24:13.662
Absolutely, Your Honor.

24:14.371 --> 24:17.374
Ms. Carlson, we were just on the subject of blood.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.586
Was there any blood evidence recovered from the defendant?

24:20.669 --> 24:21.753
No.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.755
Genetic evidence?

24:23.839 --> 24:26.758
DNA? Hairs? Fibers?

24:26.842 --> 24:28.468
No, just the fingerprint.

24:28.969 --> 24:31.513
-May I propose a hypothetical? -Okay.

24:31.597 --> 24:36.518
Let's suppose the defendant, Jacob, was walking on his way to school...

24:37.519 --> 24:40.606
and came across the victim lying on the ground.

24:41.440 --> 24:48.155
And suppose Jacob lifted the victim by the collar to see if he was okay.

24:48.238 --> 24:52.409
Might that create a fingerprint consistent with the one you found?

24:52.910 --> 24:54.494
Yes, that is possible.

24:55.037 --> 24:58.874
Now the knife that the Commonwealth attempted to enter into evidence,

24:58.957 --> 25:00.417
had you ever seen it before?

25:00.501 --> 25:01.919
Objection. Relevance.

25:02.002 --> 25:05.380
Overruled. You opened the door, counselor.

25:06.340 --> 25:08.634
Yes, the DA's office asked me to determine

25:08.717 --> 25:12.638
if that particular model of knife was consistent with the victim's wounds.

25:13.472 --> 25:16.767
And I assume they gave you other models to compare as well?

25:16.850 --> 25:18.101
No.

25:18.185 --> 25:19.228
No?

25:20.896 --> 25:23.023
Did they at least ask you to determine

25:23.106 --> 25:26.068
how many other knives might have made those wounds?

25:26.652 --> 25:27.694
No.

25:27.778 --> 25:29.238
Well, how many would you think?

25:30.572 --> 25:34.159
I don't know. That would be speculating.

25:34.243 --> 25:35.369
A thousand?

25:37.538 --> 25:38.747
A large number.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.124
Seven hundred? Five hundred?

25:42.918 --> 25:45.254
Somewhere... Somewhere in that range.

25:45.629 --> 25:50.342
In other words, the chances of it being the actual knife

25:50.425 --> 25:52.094
are one in 500. Correct?

25:52.177 --> 25:54.221
Objection. Calls for speculation.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.430
Sustained.

25:59.351 --> 26:01.019
No further questions, Your Honor.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.772
This is all going to shit.

26:03.856 --> 26:06.233
He's gonna walk. Can't you see that?

26:06.316 --> 26:07.860
He's gonna get away with killing our son

26:07.943 --> 26:10.779
because of that asshole and his goddamn theatrics.

26:10.863 --> 26:12.447
Please, I can't take this.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.241
Yeah, well, I can't take it either.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.493
Dan. Dan.

26:32.009 --> 26:34.845
How he didn't know that that stunt would backfire is beyond me.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.054
Because he's reckless.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.015
-You doing all right? -Yeah.

26:40.559 --> 26:41.810
One of them smiled.

26:43.187 --> 26:45.814
One of the jurors, the guy with the goatee.

26:45.898 --> 26:47.399
He smiled? Really?

26:47.482 --> 26:51.028
Yeah, when she admitted it was a one in 500 chance, he smiled.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.450
Something wrong?

26:57.159 --> 26:58.744
No. No, it's nothing.

26:59.453 --> 27:00.662
We'll talk later.

27:02.331 --> 27:05.959
You and Mr. Barber have worked together on many cases. Is that right?

27:06.376 --> 27:07.377
We go back, yes.

27:07.878 --> 27:10.672
Would you describe him as diligent when it came to his work?

27:11.048 --> 27:12.674
More than that. He was relentless.

27:12.758 --> 27:14.635
Was that relentlessness on display

27:14.718 --> 27:16.929
when you were attempting to cut through the school's red tape?

27:17.596 --> 27:19.431
He didn't feel the classmates were a priority.

27:19.515 --> 27:21.475
We'd already interviewed Ben's close friends.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.394
Once you did interview the students, finally,

27:24.478 --> 27:27.105
was there anything useful that came out of that?

27:27.189 --> 27:28.899
After the initial meetings, nothing much.

27:28.982 --> 27:31.109
But with some follow-up, we came to learn that

27:31.193 --> 27:33.487
there was an ongoing beef between the victim and the defendant.

27:33.570 --> 27:36.156
Meaning Ben had been bullying the defendant.

27:36.573 --> 27:37.741
For some time, yes.

27:37.824 --> 27:41.286
Was this around the time that you started to view the defendant as a suspect?

27:42.162 --> 27:43.163
It was.

27:43.247 --> 27:45.749
Even as his father was still running the investigation?

27:47.459 --> 27:49.962
Certain aspects of the investigation had to be carried out

27:50.045 --> 27:51.839
without Mr. Barber's knowledge.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.424
What did that reveal?

27:57.261 --> 28:00.639
That the defendant supposedly had a knife consistent with the wounds,

28:00.722 --> 28:02.558
that he had sufficient motive,

28:02.641 --> 28:05.519
and he had opportunity, in that his movements the morning of the attack

28:05.602 --> 28:07.437
placed him near or at the scene.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.022
Did you arrest him at this time?

28:09.106 --> 28:10.649
Not until the fingerprint came back.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.568
We then obtained a warrant and searched the house,

28:12.651 --> 28:14.862
trying to find the knife, which we did not.

28:15.821 --> 28:17.573
Did you seize the defendant's computer?

28:17.656 --> 28:20.033
We did, but we found nothing directly incriminating.

28:20.117 --> 28:23.453
Detective, are you aware of a program called Disk Scraper?

28:23.537 --> 28:27.165
I am. It's a program that wipes hard drives, deletes files, that kind of thing.

28:27.249 --> 28:30.252
Was that program on the defendant's laptop?

28:31.086 --> 28:32.087
It was.

28:33.213 --> 28:37.050
Is it possible that there was incriminating evidence on the laptop,

28:37.134 --> 28:38.552
and it was removed by the defendant?

28:38.635 --> 28:40.804
Objection. Calls for speculation.

28:40.888 --> 28:41.763
Sustained.

28:42.931 --> 28:44.183
What about pornography?

28:44.266 --> 28:46.143
-Objection. Relevance. -Sustained.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.895
Let me be more specific.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.649
Did you find any violent pornography on the defendant's laptop?

28:54.151 --> 28:56.069
I think all pornography is violent.

28:56.153 --> 28:57.196
Of course.

28:57.863 --> 29:01.366
I mean, specifically, images glorifying abuse or torture.

29:01.450 --> 29:03.035
Objection. Relevance.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.455
Overruled. The witness will answer.

29:08.790 --> 29:09.917
Some, yeah.

29:15.214 --> 29:16.256
No further questions.

29:19.176 --> 29:22.888
Detective, I assume you have executed countless search warrants

29:22.971 --> 29:25.057
-in your career, yes? -Sure.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.558
Seized a lot of laptops.

29:26.642 --> 29:27.726
Yes.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.313
Have you ever found one that didn't have some pornography on it?

29:33.232 --> 29:34.316
I don't think so.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.944
Detective, is it true that you were the first

29:37.027 --> 29:39.446
to identify Leonard Patz as a person of interest,

29:39.530 --> 29:41.281
and not Mr. Barber?

29:41.907 --> 29:43.700
Yes, I brought Patz to Andy's attention,

29:43.784 --> 29:46.245
and we agreed that he was someone we should be looking at.

29:46.912 --> 29:48.247
One last question.

29:49.790 --> 29:52.417
At any point in the investigation,

29:52.501 --> 29:58.340
did Andy Barber behave in any way to suggest that he suspected his own son?

29:58.841 --> 30:00.634
No, not in the slightest.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.971
No further questions, Your Honor.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.931
Mr. Logiudice, redirect?

30:14.481 --> 30:15.566
Detective...

30:18.777 --> 30:22.114
have you ever known Mr. Barber to be violent?

30:24.408 --> 30:26.159
-No. -Are you sure?

30:27.619 --> 30:31.081
Never seen him grab somebody by the jacket, push them into a wall?

30:31.164 --> 30:32.708
Objection. Relevance.

30:34.168 --> 30:35.335
Overruled.

30:39.715 --> 30:41.383
Once. You.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.720
After your provoked him with that crack about his father doing time for--

30:46.054 --> 30:47.264
Doing time for murder?

30:47.347 --> 30:49.558
-Objection! Your Honor! -Sustained.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.476
I'll see counsel at sidebar, right now.

30:56.732 --> 30:59.735
I'm appalled at what I just saw. We went over this in pretrial.

30:59.818 --> 31:02.529
Your Honor, it was the defense counsel who first raised the issue

31:02.613 --> 31:05.699
of whether the defendant's father had reason to suspect his own son.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.701
I am simply trying to make that argument.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.536
You have got to be kidding me.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.247
Your Honor, the defense moves for a mistrial.

31:12.331 --> 31:14.082
-Come on. -He was given specific instructions.

31:14.166 --> 31:18.837
You are on extraordinarily thin ice, Mr. Logiudice, you understand me?

31:18.921 --> 31:21.924
Now you wrap it up with this witness right now.

31:22.007 --> 31:25.594
And if I hear even a whisper about the defendant's grandfather going forward,

31:25.677 --> 31:27.721
Ms. Klein will get her mistrial. Am I clear?

31:27.804 --> 31:30.307
Yes, Your Honor.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.028
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:43.820 --> 31:48.325
there's a saying in the law, "You cannot unring the bell"...

31:49.660 --> 31:54.498
but I am going to insist that you do just that with regard to the last question.

31:57.084 --> 31:58.919
That must have been torture for you,

32:00.087 --> 32:01.588
sitting on the sidelines.

32:02.464 --> 32:03.757
I had no choice.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.052
So you trusted Ms. Klein?

32:07.845 --> 32:08.971
I did.

32:10.055 --> 32:13.725
On day four of the trial, the Commonwealth called its final witness:

32:14.560 --> 32:15.769
Derek Yoo.

32:16.854 --> 32:22.609
Did you feel that Ms. Klein adequately prepared for Derek Yoo's testimony?

32:23.527 --> 32:25.028
Yeah, as best she could.

32:25.445 --> 32:27.823
She intended to destroy his credibility?

32:28.282 --> 32:31.368
He had a plausible motive. The jury had a right to know.

32:31.869 --> 32:33.412
What about you and Laurie?

32:35.622 --> 32:37.040
What about us?

32:38.333 --> 32:39.668
Were you prepared?

33:05.402 --> 33:06.528
We've got a problem.

33:06.987 --> 33:09.156
Matt McGrath. I can't find him.

33:09.239 --> 33:10.324
What?

33:10.407 --> 33:12.326
Ellen's been trying to call his cell all week,

33:12.409 --> 33:14.703
and she finally got in touch with his mother this morning.

33:14.786 --> 33:19.082
And she said that she and Matt had a fight three days ago, and that he took off.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.752
And his girlfriend just posted online from Florida,

33:21.835 --> 33:23.837
and the mom thinks that he's down there with her.

33:23.921 --> 33:26.256
What are we supposed to do? He's supposed to take the stand tomorrow.

33:26.340 --> 33:29.801
Don't worry. We're gonna think of something. Okay.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.318
Court, all rise!

34:35.534 --> 34:39.913
I was like, "That's the same way you go to school. Did you see anything?"

34:40.539 --> 34:42.040
And Jake said no.

34:42.875 --> 34:47.838
Nothing about seeing Ben on the ground or trying to help him?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.632
No. And then he made a joke.

34:51.717 --> 34:55.262
Something like, "Couldn't happen to a nicer guy."

34:59.558 --> 35:03.437
And this is within a few hours after learning about Ben's murder?

35:03.979 --> 35:07.566
I guess, yeah. We were at Jake's house, playing video games.

35:09.401 --> 35:12.404
When you said that Ben used to pick on Jacob,

35:13.197 --> 35:14.489
what did you mean by that?

35:16.783 --> 35:20.579
Ben always kinda had it in for Jake. He was always calling him "fag."

35:21.163 --> 35:22.372
Like a nickname.

35:23.123 --> 35:27.794
Like he'd ask Jake questions about different sex things gay people do,

35:27.878 --> 35:29.922
but in front of everyone, to embarrass him.

35:30.005 --> 35:32.674
Or he'd fake a punch at Jake if he passed him in the hall.

35:32.758 --> 35:33.884
Stuff like that.

35:33.967 --> 35:36.762
And all of this bullying, it upset Jacob.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.389
-Yeah, of course. -Did it make him angry?

35:41.141 --> 35:42.726
Not so much in front of Ben, but...

35:44.102 --> 35:46.813
privately, he'd go off on how much he hated Ben's guts.

35:46.897 --> 35:52.528
Which I got. I mean, Ben would be a jerk to me too sometimes.

35:53.987 --> 35:56.240
At what point after Ben's murder

35:56.907 --> 35:59.201
did you begin to consider your friend Jacob's role in it?

35:59.284 --> 36:00.702
Objection. Leading the witness.

36:02.079 --> 36:03.205
Overruled.

36:06.124 --> 36:08.043
You can go ahead and answer, young man.

36:08.752 --> 36:10.045
I guess it was three days later.

36:10.629 --> 36:14.883
Was there anything other than his temper that began to make you suspicious?

36:14.967 --> 36:16.468
Well, yeah. The knife.

36:16.844 --> 36:19.721
Jake had this scary combat knife he'd bought in town.

36:19.805 --> 36:22.975
-He used to bring it to school sometimes. -To show it off, or what?

36:23.058 --> 36:26.353
Not really. I mean, he showed it to me and our friend Dylan...

36:27.604 --> 36:30.065
but it was more like he liked having it on him,

36:30.148 --> 36:31.358
walking around with it.

36:31.441 --> 36:34.570
Like... it was this secret thing he had.

36:35.028 --> 36:38.407
I see. So the bullying and the knife...

36:39.491 --> 36:41.368
But you knew about these things,

36:41.910 --> 36:44.538
and still, you didn't suspect Jacob immediately?

36:46.081 --> 36:49.042
I don't know. Maybe part of me did, a little.

36:50.294 --> 36:52.254
But it wasn't until I read what he wrote online.

36:52.629 --> 36:53.797
Online?

36:53.881 --> 36:57.092
This messed up site Jake was into called The Cut Up Room.

36:57.176 --> 37:00.012
By "messed up," I'm assuming you mean pornographic.

37:00.095 --> 37:03.891
Yeah, but, it's not really so much about sex.

37:03.974 --> 37:07.352
More violence. Like, really graphic stuff.

37:07.436 --> 37:09.188
Are there stories on this site?

37:10.147 --> 37:14.943
Yeah, people post all kinds of stuff. Photos, videos, stories.

37:15.027 --> 37:17.613
And do you know if Jacob posted any stories?

37:19.239 --> 37:20.824
He did, yeah.

37:20.908 --> 37:22.743
He called them Job stories.

37:23.869 --> 37:25.078
Job stories?

37:25.162 --> 37:28.665
Yeah, you know, like his initials. J-O-B?

37:29.791 --> 37:31.460
That was his screen name on there.

37:32.586 --> 37:33.795
What do you know about this?

37:33.879 --> 37:35.339
Not enough. You got to shut it down.

37:35.422 --> 37:38.842
And did Job post a story about the murder of Ben Rifkin?

37:39.426 --> 37:40.469
Yes.

37:44.139 --> 37:46.099
Commonwealth moves to enter into evidence--

37:46.183 --> 37:47.392
Objection.

37:47.476 --> 37:48.727
Your Honor, may we approach?

37:48.810 --> 37:49.937
Settle down, please.

37:52.648 --> 37:55.150
Respectfully, Your Honor, we ask to approach.

37:59.446 --> 38:03.033
Your Honor, this is an ambush. None of this was disclosed in discovery.

38:03.116 --> 38:05.202
Your Honor, this story was authored by the defendant.

38:05.285 --> 38:08.330
If he chose to hide it from his attorney, that's hardly the Commonwealth's fault.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.082
What's this about, Jacob?

38:10.916 --> 38:12.042
Jacob?

38:34.523 --> 38:36.733
Your Honor, I need to confer with my client.

38:36.817 --> 38:38.443
All right, go ahead.

38:42.406 --> 38:43.907
I'm gonna ask your patience

38:43.991 --> 38:47.578
while I allow defense counselor a moment to confer with her client.

38:50.497 --> 38:54.251
He's going to allow it unless our position is that Jacob didn't write the story.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.879
-Then that's our plan-- -They know that he wrote it, Andy.

38:56.962 --> 38:58.463
They've got an IP address.

39:00.465 --> 39:01.800
Jacob.

39:07.139 --> 39:10.851
If we push back now, we're only going to shine a brighter light on it.

39:11.310 --> 39:12.311
How bad is it?

39:20.360 --> 39:24.198
"Jason stood there on the path as Brent kept walking toward him, grinning.

39:24.615 --> 39:27.659
If Brent knew the real Jason, he would have been scared shitless.

39:27.743 --> 39:30.662
'Don't fuck with me,' Jason warned him. 'I mean it.'

39:31.246 --> 39:33.665
But Brent just laughed and grabbed him by the arm,

39:33.749 --> 39:36.251
twisting it back like he'd done so many times before.

39:36.877 --> 39:40.464
'Stop. You're hurting me,' Jason said. But it didn't hurt that much.

39:41.006 --> 39:43.967
He just wanted Brent to think that, so he would let go.

39:44.593 --> 39:48.180
Brent laughed again, the way he always did, a fake laugh.

39:48.972 --> 39:51.558
Jason's hand slipped into his sweatshirt pocket.

39:52.142 --> 39:54.394
There it was, his trusted friend.

39:54.978 --> 39:58.482
He curled his fingers around the grip and felt a surge of power through his arm,

39:58.565 --> 39:59.858
up into his shoulder.

39:59.942 --> 40:01.985
He knew there was no turning back now.

40:02.069 --> 40:03.695
The park seemed to know it too.

40:03.779 --> 40:06.448
He could hear the breeze in the leaves and birds chirping.

40:06.907 --> 40:10.077
Brent saw the knife coming for him, but it was too late to do anything but stare.

40:10.744 --> 40:15.165
It slipped in so easily Jason thought he was stabbing air. That surprised him.

40:15.249 --> 40:18.627
He did it twice more, telling his brain to remember the feeling for later.

40:22.047 --> 40:24.007
Brent fell backward and rolled down the slope,

40:24.091 --> 40:26.051
until he stopped down below.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.637
Jason knew he should go, but he couldn't help himself.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.223
He went down to Brent's body to make sure he was dead.

40:31.306 --> 40:33.851
The smell of blood in the air made him feel dizzy.

40:33.934 --> 40:37.437
He found a small stream nearby and washed the knife off, and his hand too.

40:37.521 --> 40:41.441
He could see his reflection in the water, but his face looked different to him now.

40:41.525 --> 40:43.986
'It'll be our secret,' it seemed to say.

40:47.739 --> 40:48.907
The End."

40:54.204 --> 41:00.127
This story was posted three days after Ben Rifkin's body was found?

41:01.670 --> 41:02.671
Yeah.

41:06.717 --> 41:08.302
No further questions, Your Honor.

41:10.387 --> 41:11.388
Ms. Klein?

41:22.900 --> 41:23.901
No.

41:24.818 --> 41:25.944
No, we weren't prepared.

41:27.237 --> 41:30.657
A surprising turn of events sent shock waves through the courtroom today

41:30.741 --> 41:33.619
as testimony from one of Jacob Barber's classmates

41:33.702 --> 41:37.706
provided the prosecution with some extremely damaging evidence.

41:37.789 --> 41:41.960
The reaction from the jurors was palpable, to say the least.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.501
It was just a story.

42:32.052 --> 42:34.137
I didn't know it would be a big deal.

42:40.394 --> 42:41.395
Did you do it?

42:44.565 --> 42:46.233
Just tell me. Did you kill him?

42:56.910 --> 42:57.953
No.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.961
No.

43:25.814 --> 43:29.109
I could ask the judge to issue a bench warrant for Matt McGrath.

43:29.735 --> 43:33.113
He won't. Not for some secondary witness holed up in Florida.

43:34.323 --> 43:36.575
We don't have a choice. We gotta go straight at Patz.

43:36.658 --> 43:38.243
Yeah, his subpoena was served this morning.

43:38.327 --> 43:41.246
I'll call him as a hostile witness and see what we can get out of him.

43:41.330 --> 43:45.083
We gotta run every play we have. Not just on the Patz front, Derek too.

43:45.959 --> 43:48.003
You don't think we covered Derek on cross?

43:49.671 --> 43:51.215
You did your best.

43:51.924 --> 43:53.133
You were distracted.

43:54.426 --> 43:55.719
Everyone was.

43:59.264 --> 44:03.810
We need to backstop Patz. I say we go harder on Derek, subpoena Sarah.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.979
Andy, we discussed this.

44:06.063 --> 44:09.233
That was before. We need Sarah to hammer home Derek's obsession.

44:09.316 --> 44:11.818
We need to have her repeat his words on the stand.

44:11.902 --> 44:13.737
Yeah, you're right. That could be powerful.

44:13.820 --> 44:15.155
Show the jury the selfie again.

44:15.239 --> 44:16.240
No.

44:17.616 --> 44:20.619
I don't wanna bring her into this. It's my trial. I'm saying no.

44:21.870 --> 44:23.872
Sorry, but you don't get a say in this anymore.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.377
Not after today.

44:42.266 --> 44:44.726
I'll get into it first thing tomorrow.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.514
You haven't said one word all night.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.601
Did you know?

46:08.477 --> 46:09.603
About the story?

46:10.479 --> 46:11.480
No.

46:11.563 --> 46:12.898
Just tell me the truth.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.734
-I am. -The truth. I need to know.

46:16.235 --> 46:18.320
Laurie, I swear I'm telling you the truth.

46:18.987 --> 46:20.447
What about the website?

46:20.531 --> 46:21.823
The Cut Up Room?

46:29.456 --> 46:31.166
I only kept it from you 'cause I knew it would--

46:31.250 --> 46:32.793
Don't. Don't.

46:33.502 --> 46:34.378
Don't what?

46:34.461 --> 46:37.631
Explain it away like you do everything. Excuse it away.

46:37.714 --> 46:39.216
I knew it would set you off.

46:39.716 --> 46:42.344
You were already half convinced that Jacob was guilty. I didn't want to add--

46:42.427 --> 46:43.470
Not anymore.

46:52.187 --> 46:53.605
What'd you just say?

46:56.567 --> 46:57.568
I don't believe him.

46:58.652 --> 47:00.070
Not after what I heard today.

47:04.283 --> 47:05.742
So you're gonna let this one thing change--

47:05.826 --> 47:07.327
It's always one thing.

47:07.995 --> 47:09.538
Don't you see?

47:10.080 --> 47:13.750
We're guilty too. If we protect him, we're as guilty as he is.

47:13.834 --> 47:15.878
All right. Just keep your voice down. He's right upstairs.

47:15.961 --> 47:18.714
I'm not even saying I know what to do about it. I don't.

47:19.464 --> 47:21.675
But I know what I heard, and I know what it means.

47:21.758 --> 47:23.135
Laurie, I'm begging you.

47:23.218 --> 47:26.013
Don't talk yourself into something 'cause of some made-up story.

47:26.096 --> 47:28.265
-It's not a story. -Yes, it is!

47:29.308 --> 47:30.809
This is a kid that bullied him.

47:30.893 --> 47:33.812
He probably fantasized about hurting him a thousand times.

47:33.896 --> 47:37.274
So he let his imagination run wild, and he wrote it down.

47:38.358 --> 47:39.359
Maybe...

47:40.611 --> 47:42.905
Maybe he got some sick thrill imagining it.

47:42.988 --> 47:44.573
And is that horrible? Yes.

47:44.656 --> 47:47.326
It's terrible, and it was wrong, and it was stupid,

47:47.409 --> 47:48.952
but it was a story.

47:50.245 --> 47:52.164
Joanna vetted every single line from it.

47:52.247 --> 47:55.626
There wasn't one detail that hadn't already been reported by the news.

47:55.709 --> 47:58.545
-He was fantasizing. -He was confessing.

48:00.047 --> 48:03.133
To call it anything else is just lawyer spin, and you know it.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.136
What if you knew?

48:07.804 --> 48:11.892
What if you knew in your heart that our son did this unforgivable thing?

48:12.434 --> 48:15.604
Took the life of another child? Would it even matter?

48:15.687 --> 48:17.231
I'd still love him, if that's what you're asking.

48:17.314 --> 48:19.983
No, it's not. I'd still love him too.

48:20.067 --> 48:21.944
I will always love him, no matter what.

48:22.611 --> 48:24.863
You don't know how badly I wanted to hold him tonight

48:24.947 --> 48:26.114
and tell him it's all going to be okay.

48:26.198 --> 48:28.033
But I can't play this game anymore,

48:28.575 --> 48:30.869
letting him pretend he didn't do it, pretending to each other.

48:30.953 --> 48:32.621
He's not pretending. He didn't do this.

48:32.704 --> 48:34.164
-I know he didn't do this. -No, you don't!

48:34.248 --> 48:35.916
No one can sustain that level of deception.

48:35.999 --> 48:39.044
Of course he could. You of all people should know that.

48:49.388 --> 48:50.430
Yeah.

48:51.098 --> 48:52.391
Yeah, of course.

48:54.184 --> 48:55.602
He learned it from me.

49:02.025 --> 49:03.777
Maybe he learned it from both of us.

49:10.492 --> 49:11.952
What do you want me to say, Laurie?

49:13.412 --> 49:14.413
You're right.

49:15.455 --> 49:16.748
Our marriage is a lie.

49:17.833 --> 49:21.628
Our whole fucking family is based on a fairy tale, built on nothing.

49:23.672 --> 49:24.840
And our son's a murderer.

49:26.508 --> 49:27.718
Is that what you want to hear?

49:28.844 --> 49:30.053
No.

49:33.390 --> 49:35.142
But that doesn't mean it isn't true.

50:53.804 --> 50:54.930
Hello.
