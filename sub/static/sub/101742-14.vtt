at the wrong address,

17:35.358 --> 17:36.620
half a block south,

17:36.664 --> 17:40.146
so we ran over
when we heard the gunshots.

that the security guard

works in the building.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.032

of a reputational website

17:57.076 --> 17:58.294

17:58.338 --> 17:59.817

about unreliable contractors,

That's all right.

Frank Olson?

20:39.934 --> 20:41.718
He has a wife
and a teenage son.

Avery bought a .40-cal
Smith & Wesson last month,
