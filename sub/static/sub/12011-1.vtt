Hello, lads.

Fuck off, old man...

(man 2)
Yeah, you old git.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.147

... or I'll smash your head in.

[man, indistinct]

01:21.540 --> 01:23.531
This lads...

01:23.625 --> 01:27.209
is a hurley,
used in the Irish
game of hurling...

01:27.296 --> 01:29.787
a cross between
hockey and murder.

01:29.881 --> 01:30.791

You fuck--

01:30.882 --> 01:32.588

01:32.676 --> 01:35.509
Why don't l
carve my name

01:35.596 --> 01:37.211
Hold on, hold on.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.012

Fucking kill him!

02:17.054 --> 02:19.386
If you're picking

the right weapon.

03:18.407 --> 03:21.444
(man)
Now, Sergeant, I'd like
you to tell me once again...

03:21.576 --> 03:24.283
about your violent urges.

03:24.371 --> 03:28.455
Uh, I must insist
that you extinguish that.

03:28.542 --> 03:34.253
And you'll do what,
exactly, if I don't?
Arrest me?

03:34.339 --> 03:38.127
I'm not sure you realize
the gravity of your situation.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.678
Nice pen.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.970
Sergeant?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.797
Nice pen, I said.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.928
Says a lot about you.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.681
Oh, is that so?
Pray tell.

03:50.772 --> 03:55.311
You like a solid phallic
symbol between your fingers.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.986
Sergeant Brant,
in the last year...

03:59.114 --> 04:02.606
you've been
charged with bugging
the Superintendent's office...

04:02.701 --> 04:05.317
beating a felon unconscious
in a billiards hall...

04:05.412 --> 04:09.246
and just last week
you assaulted three
innocent youths...

04:09.332 --> 04:12.574
with a hockey stick.
Shall I go on?

04:12.669 --> 04:17.163
My report will be a
major factor in whether
you remain in the force.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.507
Ser-- Sergeant Brant,
sit down.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.928
The thing is, Doc...

04:33.023 --> 04:38.768
this is the only work l
can do, and if I get bounced...

04:38.820 --> 04:42.358
I'm sure I'll do
something truly reckless.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.361
[incidental music]

04:53.293 --> 04:54.783
Hi.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.665
[incidental music continues]

04:57.756 --> 04:59.747
[walla]

05:04.179 --> 05:06.716
You got a
minute for me?
[music fades]

05:06.807 --> 05:10.015
Yeah. What is it?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.301
I don't know.

05:12.437 --> 05:16.806
I thought two years
undercover on the Drug Squad
would help me out, but...

05:16.900 --> 05:19.391
I don't know.

05:19.528 --> 05:22.770
I thought maybe my past
went against me or...

05:22.823 --> 05:26.065
I failed the
Sergeant’s exam.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.820
Everyone fails
the first time.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.448
Did you?

05:30.580 --> 05:35.370
[sighs]
Now you've only
been out of rehab a few
months. Give it time.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.211
(Superintendent)
Falls, go grab
some piss poor tea
in the canteen, okay?

05:48.306 --> 05:51.719
[scoffs]
You don't wanna
believe what you read
in the papers, sir.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.051
It's not
what this station
needs right now.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.603
You know we can't afford
any more bad publicity.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.148
Imagine you walk
down the street...

06:04.239 --> 06:07.606
and you bump into
three blokes carrying
carpeting knives.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.819
Nah, they're not
carpet fitters.
They're after your wallet.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.824
Maybe even that gold watch...

06:13.915 --> 06:17.032
that you got for the highest
arrest rate in the Southeast.

06:17.168 --> 06:21.502
One of the rats there even
very kindly offered to carve
their name in your face.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.374
Now, would you be more
worried about whether
you're gonna have a fight...

06:25.510 --> 06:29.048
than how it looks in the papers?

06:29.139 --> 06:34.634
Well, just keep a
low profile until this
little shit storm blows over.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.991
Business is brisk.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.907
Have that, Daniel.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.836
[sighs]
I don't think I can
go through with this.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.381
[sighs]
You'll be okay.
It'll be over
in no time.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.215
You think I should've
gone for a burial?

07:08.303 --> 07:10.168
No.

07:10.221 --> 07:15.056
[indistinct]
You'll be glad.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.351
We're ready for you,
Inspector Roberts.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.929
Go on.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.610
Who got
the flowers?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.904
Owner of a stall
in Streatham owed
me a favor.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.232
Does a clean line
in fruit and veg.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.989
It's time.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.039
[incidental music]

07:39.125 --> 07:42.993
Got some last words, Gov?
[sighs]

08:05.986 --> 08:09.695
We'll miss you, love.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.651
Coats and Hammond,
as quick as you can.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.991
Let's get you legless.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.337

08:35.432 --> 08:37.764
The urn, Brant.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.217
Where the fuck's the urn?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.682
Someone must've
nicked that.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.022
[chuckles]

08:55.660 --> 08:58.572
One of these guys.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.790
Up, up and away.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.952

10:01.726 --> 10:03.762
What?

10:03.853 --> 10:06.219
We need you down at
Smithfield yesterday, Brant.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.225
An officer is down.
All hands to the pump...

10:08.316 --> 10:10.432
and don 't go talking
to any fucking journalists.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.058

The officer
is Sandra Bates--

(woman)
O h, no. It can't be.

10:20.829 --> 10:24.822

is armed and dangerous--

That is some dress.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.211
Yeah, well you
look shitty.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.219
I've been consoling the
Inspector. His wife passed.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.341
Yeah. I heard.

10:41.432 --> 10:46.222
I knew Sandra.
We were at Police
College together.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.519
Brant.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.187
Was there something?

10:50.275 --> 10:51.765
Sir? There's a witness.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.818
What? Why
wasn't I told?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.816
I've been trying to tell you
for the past half an hour.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.398
Take his statement.

11:00.535 --> 11:04.653
[background chopper,
[incidental music]

11:09.127 --> 11:12.369
[reporter over TV]
The dead policewoman
has been identified as...

11:12.505 --> 11:16.043
as 26-year-old
Sandra Bates of Camberwell.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.546
Described as a credit
to her force...

11:18.636 --> 11:20.922
she was shot
at point blank range...

11:21.014 --> 11:22.800
and died instantly.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.223
And now from our
Washington correspondent--

11:25.310 --> 11:28.928
[walla]

11:28.980 --> 11:30.311
It's Tony, right?

11:30.398 --> 11:32.104
Anthony.
You're Brant, right?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.932
You know me?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.734
Who doesn’t? Last year
at Camberwell billiards...

11:36.821 --> 11:40.109
when that nutter
come in with a crowbar,
attacked a couple of mates?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.906
You rocked up,
beat matey to a pulp.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.403
That makes me think
you're a legend.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.323
I'm flattered.
They got names?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.746
That's Posh.
That's Becks.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.073
Posh and fucking Becks?

11:50.168 --> 11:52.409
You're fucking right.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.582
So run the description
by me again.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.085
Ain't you gonna
take any notes?

11:58.176 --> 12:01.760
Do I look
like I carry a pencil?

12:01.846 --> 12:04.337
[incidental music]

12:20.365 --> 12:22.697
Morning. I'm
Porter Nash.

12:22.784 --> 12:27.574
Superintendent Brown
said to talk to you
about getting a locker.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.511
[incidental music continues]

12:55.149 --> 12:57.891
(Superintendent)
Due to the recent
death of his wife...

12:57.986 --> 13:00.773
Chief Inspector Roberts
is on extended leave.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.780
I'm therefore promoting
Sergeant Porter Nash...

13:03.866 --> 13:05.948
to Acting Inspector...
[audience chuckles]

13:06.035 --> 13:07.195

of the inquiry.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.618

Sir?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.445
(Superintendent)
Yes?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.997
Shouldn't we promote
one of our own?
[all laugh]

13:13.084 --> 13:15.996
(Superintendent)
Now, now gents.
I don 't need
to remind you...

13:16.087 --> 13:18.624
that we're already
the focus of a media circus.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.840
Sergeant Nash comes to us
from the prestigious
West London branch...

13:22.927 --> 13:26.920
and it is my opinion that
he will instill a level
of professionalism...

13:27.015 --> 13:30.382
hitherto lacking
in our primitive
Southeast Division.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.257
Take that hood
off your head.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.925
I'm in trouble.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.173
You got
any beers
or anything?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.925
You know I haven't.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.972
Sit down.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.846
Talk.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.348
[panting]
Well, me, Macky and Bowes were

14:16.439 --> 14:21.354
What? Looking for a madness?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.776
I think we killed someone.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.607
Some camel jockey.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.314
Sorry, I mean
an Indian guy.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.401
He weren't moving.
[panting]

14:34.749 --> 14:36.990
Okay.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.996
Okay, I'll look into it.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.577
Thank you--

14:40.671 --> 14:43.378
Shut up.
I ain't finished yet.

14:43.508 --> 14:46.170
If he's dead,
you're on your own.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.219
Yeah? In fact, I’ll
come round your yard
and nick you myself.

14:50.306 --> 14:54.345
Now you go home
and you wait till
you hear from me.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.262
It's choice time, John.
If he lives...

14:59.357 --> 15:03.020
you either quit that gang
or you quit coming round
here, you understand?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.066
Yeah.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.393
Yeah, what?

15:05.530 --> 15:10.320
Yes, ma'am.

Brant, can l
have a word?

15:16.040 --> 15:19.828
I just need to
have a quick chat.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.963
(Brant)
So what can l
do for you?

15:27.051 --> 15:30.384
[clears throat]
I need a favor.

15:30.513 --> 15:35.598
A friend of mine is in trouble.
I need to get him off the hook.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.141
Someone you're riding?

15:37.228 --> 15:40.937
What?
No, nothing like that.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.098
He's a kid.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.683
There's a DI.
I used to know him
from way back.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.190
We shared a snitch in Brixton.
He'll be able to help.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.213
Harold Dunlop.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.666
(man over phone)
I read your stuff
in the papers.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.251
I've got some information
on the police killings.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.678
All rig ht.
Hang on.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.312
All right. Fire away.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.310
Aw, have some
fucking manners.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.643
I'm offering you information.
You don't even say hello.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.979
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.
Is that better?

16:31.073 --> 16:33.189
I detest sarcasm.

16:33.326 --> 16:38.195
Maybe I'll start
on journalists when
I've finished my cop quota.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.371
[suspenseful music]

16:40.458 --> 16:42.244
Oh, uh, heh...

16:42.335 --> 16:44.041
Listen fellow.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.494
You and me got off to
the wrong start, didn't we?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.204
So let's try again now.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.085
What's your name?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.417
Oh, Christ. I'm not sure
you're even up to the task.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.134
(Dunlop)
What task?

16:54.180 --> 16:58.389
Reporting from inside
the police killings?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.100
[suspenseful music]

17:01.187 --> 17:04.805
(man over phone)
Where are you on
the food chain?
You got any clout?

17:04.941 --> 17:08.398
(Dunlop)
Well, I'm a staff writer
in the crime department, yeah.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.771
(man)
I can make you famous.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.652
(man)
Yo there, copper!
Remember me?

17:15.701 --> 17:16.656
Do you want something?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.612
Thing.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.242
What?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.116
It's 'something'
not somethink. '

17:21.207 --> 17:23.698
You should at least
be able to speak properly.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.499
Look, get lost mate, yeah?

17:25.586 --> 17:28.202
I've got a question, yeah?
What would you do...

17:28.297 --> 17:31.130
if I was
to call you a cunt?

17:31.217 --> 17:34.129
(man over phone)
Which do you prefer?
Seven or eight?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.676
Eight.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.628
Eight it is.
[suspenseful music]

17:37.723 --> 17:39.509
Hang on. What?
Eight what?

17:41.811 --> 17:44.052
Eight more coppers
to kill. Bye.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.102
What--

17:46.190 --> 17:48.055
[suspenseful
music intensifies]

18:17.763 --> 18:20.596
Cup of tea
and a biscuit.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.773
Are you as black
as you're painted?

18:30.860 --> 18:33.226
Are you as Nancy
as they say?

18:33.362 --> 18:36.354
Thing is, Brant,
if there's a problem,
I'm gonna need to know about it.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.360
There's a problem, all right.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.158
Some sick fuck
is killing policemen...

18:41.245 --> 18:43.702
and he's only just started.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.495
I meant between us.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.199
I know what you meant.

18:48.336 --> 18:53.501
Problem?
Not unless you
follow me into public toilets.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.379
So I don't get to be
head boy. Big fucking deal.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.502
Less paperwork for me.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.133
[incidental music]

19:01.182 --> 19:03.264
(officer)
There's nothing, sir.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.757
(Nash)
See if you
can get me a possible
match of the bullet.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.308
(officer)
Yes, sir.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.228
(female officer)
[indistinct]

19:09.315 --> 19:11.397
(Nash)
Just keep it open
for me, for now.

19:11.525 --> 19:16.189
Move your right and take your
fucking left hand up and over.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.066
[indistinct]

19:18.157 --> 19:20.694
Aw, fuck me.
Not you again, mate.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.532
(Brant)
I'll keep coming back
until you get me
a knife.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.201
Keep your
right hand up.
I keep telling ya.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.903
You're getting
caught with your
left up.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.410
(man)
No, that's not him.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.991
(woman)
[indistinct]

19:30.086 --> 19:34.329
Yeah, please.
That's quite important.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.418
Want me to widen
the area for questioning?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.632
Great, yeah.
Great idea.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.334
(woman)
The gun was a
9mm semi-automatic.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.169
A SIG or a Glock?

19:42.264 --> 19:43.925
(Nash)
I'll go on
to forensics now.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.222
No?

19:45.309 --> 19:46.674
(man)
I don't fucking know.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.100
I don't know!

19:48.187 --> 19:49.973
I wanna know
the name

19:50.064 --> 19:51.975
of every punk
that you sold

19:52.066 --> 19:54.352
a 9 mil semi-automatic
pistol to in the last
few months.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.525
(Nash)
He's got his back
turned every time.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.978
He knows where
the cameras are.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.188
(Brant)
Don't make me
come back

20:00.282 --> 20:01.692
and give me
the same

20:01.742 --> 20:03.323
fucking silly
answers, all right?

20:03.411 --> 20:05.618
I'll ring
you when I've
got something.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.912
(Brant)
I want the name, address
and fucking postal code.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.489
(officer)
Sarge, come have
a look at this?

20:10.584 --> 20:14.793
We've got no
footage of the killing
of the second officer.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.745
(Nash)
There must be more.
Keep looking.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.047
(man)
Sir.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.850
You know what I want...

20:30.938 --> 20:32.929
so spill.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.849
Well, I need paying first.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.446
What do you have in mind?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.531
Serious.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.654
Serious money.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.077
Serious money?

20:48.164 --> 20:49.654
Mmm-hmm.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.331
What, like the time
of benefit?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.203
Yeah.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.537
[patting]
Bony fucker, aren't ya?

20:58.632 --> 21:02.841
You don't have the brains
of a chicken, do you?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.715
[groaning]

21:05.806 --> 21:09.549
I doubt you have any real
Irish blood in you, Radnor.

21:09.643 --> 21:13.932
Me, I'm a wild streak
and a Celt.
Makes me unpredictable.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.893
Them Irish. Did you know
they invented kneecap?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.316
It's a nasty business.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.769
They fix you up
as best they can...

21:21.864 --> 21:25.607
but you'll
always have a limp.
How does that sound?

21:25.701 --> 21:30.320
Radnor the gimp.
How does that go down
in your retirement package?

21:30.414 --> 21:31.824
[groaning]

21:31.916 --> 21:34.498
[panting]

21:34.585 --> 21:37.827
A brandy here, Paul.
And a large scotch.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.004
[panting]

21:40.090 --> 21:43.753
Here's what we'll do.

21:43.844 --> 21:49.589
We'll have a nice stiff drink.
Ought to fire us off.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.595
[crunching]

21:52.686 --> 21:55.928
Well, go on, Rad.
Pay the man.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.723
Well, l-- I don't
drink brandy.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.439
Yeah, keep
the change.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.989
Okay, tell me.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.408
There's this bloke
at the Peacock Gym.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.119
He set fire
to a police dog.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.377
YouTubed it.
Somebody asked him
why he did it. He said...

22:23.509 --> 22:27.343
"Practice."

22:27.429 --> 22:28.919
Well, that's it?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.925
Seriously, he's a nutter.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.927
Fuck, if we pulled in
every wanker who said that...

22:33.018 --> 22:34.599
we'd be up to our
arse in suspects.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.143
What's his name?

22:36.230 --> 22:38.095
Well, I don't--
I don't-- I don't know.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.852
But I'm meeting a guy
later who's gonna
get it for me.

22:40.943 --> 22:44.231
Don't bother.
I'll go to the gym.
Ask the manager.

22:44.321 --> 22:48.439
But you see, l--
Don't I get something?

22:48.576 --> 22:52.535
I left you the rest of my
crisps, you greedy bugger.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.992
What more do you want?

22:55.082 --> 22:57.198
For fuck's sake.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.500
Are you fucking me?

22:59.587 --> 23:03.250
Can I have
my change back, please?

23:03.340 --> 23:06.252
Fuck, I can't walk.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.671
[incidental music]

24:00.439 --> 24:03.852
(Nash)
Are you as black
as you're painted?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.571
[doorbell ringing]

24:22.294 --> 24:24.660
[indistinct]

24:24.755 --> 24:27.167
Disturbing you,
am l?

24:27.257 --> 24:29.873
No, I was just
in the middle
of eating.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.632
Go ahead.
That's your Tex Mex, isn't it?

24:38.185 --> 24:40.050
Christ, what is that?

24:40.145 --> 24:43.057
Hare Krishna food?
[burns out cigarette]

24:43.148 --> 24:44.854
Better put some
meat in you, boy.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.063
A big juicy steak.
Get the blood flowing.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.065
[scoffs]
You know,
the chaps had a word...

24:51.156 --> 24:54.114
for this type of
bare look, didn't they?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.567
Minimalist.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.612
Shy is the word
I had in mind.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.618
Can I get a drink, then?

25:01.709 --> 25:04.826
Over there.
Help yourself.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.214
Jesus, no wonder you
stay at home.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.541
[pouring]
So what are you having?

25:12.636 --> 25:15.719
(Nash)
I've got some
water, thanks.

25:15.806 --> 25:20.391
Can I ask you
why you're here?

25:20.519 --> 25:24.011
I need your advice.

25:24.106 --> 25:28.566
Look, I don't give
a fuck about you
being a pillow biter.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.813
I don't give a fuck
what people do...

25:30.904 --> 25:33.737
as long as they
keep it to themselves.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.613
[sighs]

25:35.701 --> 25:39.535
I respect you
and there's not many I do.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.322
What's the problem?

25:46.420 --> 25:48.376
I'm losing it.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.587
In what way?

25:50.674 --> 25:54.792
[sighs]

25:54.887 --> 25:57.344
I'm blacking out.

25:57.431 --> 26:02.050
Not often, but enough
to be worried.

26:02.102 --> 26:07.142
Don't wanna talk, eat.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.941
It's actually a huge effort
to drag myself outta bed.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.986
[sighs]

26:14.073 --> 26:17.611
I just stare at the wall.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.901
Just do nothing, you know?

26:20.996 --> 26:23.078
Absolutely nothing.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.030
It's burnout.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.331
What?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.534
Your brain's on meltdown.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.210
A couple of days
doing nothing...

26:30.297 --> 26:31.878
and you’ll
start to come back.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.956
You sound pretty sure.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.212
Yeah, I am sure.
I've been there myself.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.377
You?

26:38.514 --> 26:40.880
Yeah. I could barely
work the microwave.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.056
I was fucked.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.226
We got this pedophile
on the loose in Holland Park.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.055
He was luring
children into his car.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.391
We knew who he was
but we just couldn't
catch him in the act.

26:52.528 --> 26:56.521
These kids were too
traumatized to identify him.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.776
He was this big
showbiz agent, you know.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.279
Major connections.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.076
The guys back
at the nick...

27:03.163 --> 27:04.949
they just about put me
on a par with him...

27:05.040 --> 27:06.905
because I was
a queer, yeah?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.332
Wanked off into condoms
and leave them
in my locker...

27:09.419 --> 27:12.661
scratched the car,
sugar in the petrol tank.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.371
All the usual shit.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.591
It put me
under tremendous pressure.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.545
I was knocking back
Valium, shots at breakfast...

27:20.639 --> 27:22.220
two packs a day.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.889
So I thought, fuck it.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.094
I thought I'd take matters
into my own hands.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.892
And I broke
into the pedophile's
house at 4:00 in the morning...

27:30.983 --> 27:33.725
and I smashed his bollocks
in with a baseball bat...

27:33.819 --> 27:36.811
until they fucking popped.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.770
I took a leave
of absence after that.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.572
I was burnt out.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.025
Came back here,
I shut the curtains.

27:43.120 --> 27:48.205
Pulled the phone out.
Just hid away.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.876
I went back to work
expecting the axe...

27:51.962 --> 27:55.580
but they ended up
transferring me.

27:55.674 --> 28:02.421
[snoring]

28:02.556 --> 28:04.968
Wanker.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.070
[classical music]

28:24.161 --> 28:26.868
Morning.
Want some breakfast?

28:26.955 --> 28:29.992
A coffee,
two sugars.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.838
You had an affair
with me?

28:38.926 --> 28:41.087
I held back.

28:41.178 --> 28:44.215
So any idea who
we're looking for?

28:44.306 --> 28:48.094
A psycho.
Whistles while he works.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.016
Showed up
at Peacock Gym yesterday.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.599
I got the name
of a bloke in Nunhead.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.929
Worth a visit?

28:53.982 --> 28:55.643
You want me along?

28:55.734 --> 28:57.770
Sure. See you there
in half an hour.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.605
[slurps]

29:03.116 --> 29:07.826
Oh, yeah. The other thing,
about you being a good cop.
I meant that.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.074
Thank you.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.498
For a poofter.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.807
[incidental music]

29:49.329 --> 29:51.194
(Roberts)
You replaced me.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.405
(Superintendent)
You're on compassionate leave.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.452
I 'm back.

29:54.543 --> 29:58.582
Inspector Roberts,
losing a wife
is not easy.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.082
You lost your wife?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.834
Well, no--
[sighs]

30:01.925 --> 30:04.007
How would you feel
about early retirement?

30:04.094 --> 30:06.756
We'd miss you, sir.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.803
You know who
else would miss you?

30:08.890 --> 30:13.930
Olga, the 250-pound
call girl you see
every Wednesday.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.387
Your wife thinks
you're playing squash.

30:16.523 --> 30:20.107
Well, you are, in a way.

30:20.193 --> 30:24.152
I don't need a fanfare.
I don't need an office.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.820
I just wanna work.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.568
Well, what are
you waiting for?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.240
Fuck off, Roberts.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.990
Go solve some crimes.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.662
[incidental music]

30:44.259 --> 30:46.500
[knocking]

30:48.013 --> 30:50.880
[moans]
Fuck.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.680
[knocking]
Police! Open up!

31:02.611 --> 31:04.272
[groaning]
Uh.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.230
Oh!
[panting]

31:09.618 --> 31:13.907
[knocking]

31:13.997 --> 31:18.741
[incidental music intensifies]

31:18.835 --> 31:21.326
(Nash)
Barry Weiss?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.041
That is me.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.417
Can we come in?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.506
Got a warrant?

31:27.594 --> 31:30.927
(Brant)
It's in the post.

31:31.014 --> 31:34.632
[suspenseful music]

31:43.068 --> 31:44.729
[yawning]

31:52.035 --> 31:54.026
(Weiss)
Can I get you anything?

31:54.121 --> 31:58.364
How about a cuppa, coppers?

31:58.458 --> 32:00.414
I know you.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.993
If we'd met,
I'm sure I'd remember.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.926
(Weiss)
You know what that is?

32:16.017 --> 32:19.430
Michael Jackson's shit.
[chuckles]

32:19.563 --> 32:21.770
It's priceless.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.893
I got it off eBay.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.942
So what was it you
were looking for?
Maybe I could help you.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.939
(Nash)
What do you do, Mr. Weiss?

32:29.030 --> 32:32.113
(Weiss)
I'm between jobs.

32:32.200 --> 32:36.739
You like torching
dogs, do ya?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.821
I saw your
home movie.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.076
On YouTube, right?

32:41.168 --> 32:43.910
It got over 9,000
hits before they
took it down.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.837
I post--
I posted it, yeah,
but I wasn't involved.

32:46.923 --> 32:49.289
Nah, I'm joking.
I love animals, me.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.251
What about police, Barry?
You like them?

32:52.345 --> 32:54.927
"Thank God," I say.

32:55.015 --> 32:59.179
I say "Thank God
for the men in blue."

32:59.269 --> 33:03.729
I remember you now, Barry.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.103
Yeah, you're
the piece of shit
from the billiards hall.

33:11.156 --> 33:15.069
Back on your feet,
I see.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.741
[suspenseful music continues]

33:16.828 --> 33:20.992
Come on, Nash.
Let's get out of here.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.382
What was
all that about?

33:32.511 --> 33:35.048
I had a run in with
him about a year ago.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.049
I might have put
him in the hospital.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.256
Welcome to the liberal
Southeast.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.558
It gets results.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.852
Let's just keep
an eye on him.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.555
You just wait and see.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.766
Yeah?

33:48.860 --> 33:52.318
[suspenseful music]

33:52.405 --> 33:54.441
You wait and see.

33:56.785 --> 34:00.528
What are you
fucking looking at,
you fucking perv?

35:03.226 --> 35:07.139

35:07.230 --> 35:10.893

Who is it?

37:12.272 --> 37:14.888
(Weiss)
Satellite TV.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.144
I've come for your box.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.615
What's the problem?
I just paid the bill.

37:25.660 --> 37:28.823
[chuckles}
That's funny...

37:28.913 --> 37:30.574
because you
are the bill.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.280
You're not
the usual bloke--

37:34.502 --> 37:35.662
Ugh.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.133

38:39.818 --> 38:41.354
B! B! B.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.150
A. Jack Milroy

38:43.238 --> 38:46.150
B. Andy Stewart
or C. Sir Harry Lauder?

38:46.241 --> 38:49.074
B.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.574
Come on, you fucking idiot, B.
[chuckles}

39:17.856 --> 39:19.721
Yes.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.182

[Weiss over phone]
There 's a fire
at Cerinem Point.

39:50.930 --> 39:55.048
In a flat on the 1 6th
floor, you'll find
cop number three.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.680
Oh, I used a new system.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.135
A new system?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.596
Can you be
a bit clearer?

40:01.691 --> 40:03.682
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.064
Is that clear
enough for you?
[hangs up]

40:07.155 --> 40:09.396
[turns device on]

40:09.532 --> 40:11.864
(Weiss)
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.236
[whispering]
Oh, yeah.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.694
[phone ringing]
Oh, shit.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.528
Yeah, I forgot.
I got a name.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.740
A name?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.950
Is there an echo?
Stop repeating
everything I say.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.285
It's getting
on my fucking tits.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.744
I'm sorry.

40:24.839 --> 40:28.673
It's "Blitz"
as in "Blitzkrieg."

40:28.760 --> 40:30.341
You got that?

40:30.428 --> 40:33.295
Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.175

Oh, fuck.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.346

to see this.

Where the hell
have you been?

41:36.035 --> 41:37.400
Can't say.

41:37.537 --> 41:39.619
What do you mean
you can't say?

41:39.706 --> 41:41.412
Can't account
for my movements?

41:41.541 --> 41:43.122
Is that
the correct lingo?

41:43.209 --> 41:45.575
You do know another
policeman’s been killed?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.080
Chief Inspector Roberts.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.207
What?

41:49.298 --> 41:51.835
(Nash)
The killer's targets
are in this station.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.713
He used a hammer
to kill Roberts
and he torched his flat.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.920
He contacted some hack
journalist at The Post...

41:57.015 --> 41:59.973
called Dunlop.
Gave him all
the details.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.924
Dunlop you say?

42:02.020 --> 42:04.056
Yeah. Harold Dunlop.
I sent a team over there...

42:04.147 --> 42:06.354
to tap his phone and make
sure his calls are traced.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.601
Do you know him?

42:07.692 --> 42:09.273
I do.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.193
[incidental music]

42:12.280 --> 42:13.895
I'm Harold Dunlop
from The Post.

Hey! Get off!

[Dunlop, shouting]
All right! All right!
Bloody hell!

42:19.203 --> 42:20.409
What was
all that about?

42:20.538 --> 42:22.403
I told you,
I know him.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.072
Hello? Dunlop.

43:44.163 --> 43:46.870
(man)
Is this Harold Dunlop?

43:46.958 --> 43:48.619
Yeah. Yeah.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.665
The Harold Dunlop?
The crime reporter?

43:50.753 --> 43:51.742
Can you get me a lattè?

43:51.838 --> 43:53.749
Yeah. Who's this?

43:53.840 --> 43:57.424
Mr. Dunlop, how would
you like to nail The Blitz?

43:57.552 --> 43:59.793
Yeah, I 'd like
that very much.

43:59.929 --> 44:04.548
(man)
Oh-ho! Is that it?
Perhaps I didn't make
myself clear, Mr. Dunlop.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.758
I know the name
of the cop killer.

44:06.853 --> 44:10.345
I think you're gonna
have to work a little bit
harder than that.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.805
It'll be an honor to bring
that maniac to justice.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.265
Yeah. Yeah.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.271
Well, you'll have
a little think...

44:16.362 --> 44:18.694
about how much
you'd be willing to pay.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.025
Come now, Mr. Dunlop.

44:21.117 --> 44:24.655
You didn't think this was
a citizen doing his bit
now, did you?

44:24.745 --> 44:25.905
How much do you want?

44:25.997 --> 44:28.033
50k. In cash.

44:28.124 --> 44:31.241
For that, you get
the name of The Blitz...

44:31.335 --> 44:33.166
plus extras.

44:33.254 --> 44:35.040
Extras?
What do you mean extras?

44:35.131 --> 44:37.588
Various assorted
items, Mr. Dunlop.

44:37.675 --> 44:41.088
You'll find out
when I get my 50k.

44:45.850 --> 44:48.967
I'm the master
of the fucking universe.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.931
[humming]

44:55.568 --> 44:56.978
Hello.

44:57.069 --> 44:59.355
Hey.

44:59.447 --> 45:04.737
The fire pretty much
destroyed anything
around the body.

45:04.869 --> 45:08.361
(woman)
We found that in the bathroom.
The fire wasn't
so bad in there.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.702
(Nash)
But did the heat or water
damage any DNA
or fingerprints?

45:11.792 --> 45:13.578
I'm afraid so.

45:18.341 --> 45:20.297
Peacock Gym.

45:20.384 --> 45:23.091
(Nash)
Yeah, looks like it.
[dialing]

45:23.221 --> 45:27.555
It's B rant.
Check if DI Roberts
was ever a member
of the Peacock Gym.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.021
What are you doing?

45:36.108 --> 45:38.144
I told you to wait
until you heard
from me.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.022
Yeah, well,
I didn't hear from you.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.773
Yeah.
Well, I'm sorting it.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.404
Yeah? I'm trying to.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.740
Look, just go home.

45:46.827 --> 45:50.285
[incidental music]

46:07.723 --> 46:09.839
DI Stokes?

46:09.934 --> 46:11.344
You must be Falls.

46:11.435 --> 46:12.800
Yeah. Yeah.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.305
What'll you have?

46:14.397 --> 46:17.605
Tea, please, sir.
Just tea.

46:17.692 --> 46:20.399
Forget the "sir" stuff.
Craig'll do.

46:20.528 --> 46:21.859
Tea and toast
for two!

46:21.946 --> 46:23.732
(woman)
Coming up, love!

46:23.823 --> 46:26.360
(Stokes)
Okay. Well, we've got
two of the kids...

46:26.450 --> 46:28.361
involved in the assault
of Mr. Azziz.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.612
I thought-- He's not--?

46:29.704 --> 46:32.537
Dead? Incredibly, no.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.205
Let me see.

46:35.293 --> 46:38.160
John Wells,
known as Metal.

46:38.254 --> 46:40.586
This the one
you wanted to discuss?

46:40.673 --> 46:41.753
Yes.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.923
What is he? A snitch?

46:44.010 --> 46:45.966
Yeah, well, you know...

46:46.053 --> 46:49.637
and I try to look out
for him.

46:49.724 --> 46:52.807
Thank you.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.760
He's a piece of shit.

46:55.855 --> 46:56.844
A thug.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.679
Oh, he's a boy.

46:58.774 --> 47:02.642
Underneath all that,
he's just a scared boy.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.651
So is there
anything you can do?

47:08.743 --> 47:11.234
Anything can be buried.

47:11.329 --> 47:14.321
Will you?

47:14.415 --> 47:17.327
Meet me for a drink tonight.

47:17.418 --> 47:18.749
[incidental music]

47:18.836 --> 47:20.542
That's all?

47:29.972 --> 47:33.760
Hey, Roberts and
the Peacock Gym.
Never a member.

47:33.851 --> 47:36.058
No, of course not.

47:36.145 --> 47:37.760
Have you got a minute?

47:37.855 --> 47:39.061
Yeah.

47:39.148 --> 47:41.059
Can you work that thing?

47:41.150 --> 47:43.186
Brant, you're
such a dinosaur.

47:43.277 --> 47:46.986
I'm surprised you can even
work your own microwave.

47:47.073 --> 47:49.985
This is
women's work.
Just like typing.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.816
Right.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.572
So what are
you looking for?

47:53.621 --> 47:56.579
Barry Weiss.
It's the Belfront Towers.

47:56.665 --> 48:02.126
(Brant)
Kicked out of Peacock Gym.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.876
(woman)
Oh, wow. This guy's
always in trouble.

48:05.966 --> 48:10.630
He's been arrested more times
than you've had WPC's.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.177
You know I'm
not like that.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.095
Right.

48:14.183 --> 48:17.926
(woman)
It's petty stuff, though.
What do you think?

48:18.020 --> 48:20.557
No, nothing major.

48:20.648 --> 48:21.888
None of that yet.

48:27.279 --> 48:29.019
Have you got my money?

48:29.115 --> 48:31.356
Yeah. I just had to
pull a few strings.

48:31.534 --> 48:35.447
(man)
Pick me up outside
Weymouth Street car park.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.541
Stand there.

48:50.636 --> 48:51.716
All right.

48:51.804 --> 48:54.261
There. Steady. There.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.714
Oh, Jesus.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.649
[click]

49:07.736 --> 49:10.694
Click.

49:17.455 --> 49:19.320
[suspenseful music]

49:19.415 --> 49:22.157
(Radnor)
These are the extras
I was talking about.

49:22.251 --> 49:25.414
Trophies, I believe
is the correct term.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.745
And you know
who these belong to, eh?

49:27.840 --> 49:30.297
Correct.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.923
[shuts trunk]

49:32.011 --> 49:33.967
[suspenseful
music intensifies]

49:34.054 --> 49:35.885
Right, I showed
you mine.

49:35.973 --> 49:38.760
Perhaps we could
have a little look
at yours now.

49:38.851 --> 49:41.593
[humming]

49:44.607 --> 49:47.314
[indistinct]

50:05.002 --> 50:07.744
All right.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.624
Aw.

50:09.715 --> 50:10.921
What?

50:11.008 --> 50:12.248
That's not
fifty grand.

50:12.301 --> 50:13.791
Of course
it's fifty grand.

50:13.886 --> 50:15.251
There's no way
that's fifty grand.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.836
When did you
last see fifty grand?

50:16.931 --> 50:18.592
Don't you trust me?
Go and count it.

50:18.682 --> 50:19.762
It's about
500 quid.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.181
Oh. Go on, then.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.930
I'm gonna count
every bit of it.

50:23.979 --> 50:26.516
Good. Buy yourself
a new suit.

50:26.607 --> 50:31.852
[suspenseful music]

50:31.946 --> 50:34.688
Fifty, fifty,
fifty, fifty, fifty.

50:34.740 --> 50:39.734
You are a fucking genius.

50:39.828 --> 50:41.568
[door closes]

50:41.664 --> 50:45.031
[suspenseful music]

50:50.506 --> 50:52.292
I haven't told him
your name yet.

50:52.341 --> 50:55.378
(Weiss)
Relax. I'm not
gonna hurt you.

50:55.511 --> 50:59.925
I only do police. Remember?

51:00.015 --> 51:02.131
How'd you get on to me?

51:02.226 --> 51:07.516
I got your address
from the Peacock Gym...

51:07.606 --> 51:11.645
and I went
through your rubbish.

51:11.735 --> 51:14.977
I found the receipt
for the parking garage.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.858
That's very impressive.

51:16.949 --> 51:20.066
[whispering]
I haven't told him
your name yet.

51:23.622 --> 51:25.283
I haven't
told him your name.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.990
But you're gonna
have to help me
out, see?

51:28.085 --> 51:29.621
Ah.

51:29.712 --> 51:32.624
I haven't told him
your name yet.

51:32.715 --> 51:34.922
This is a bit
of a tight squeeze.

51:35.009 --> 51:37.091
[groaning]

51:37.177 --> 51:40.214
I haven't told him
your name yet.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.796
No, no, no.

51:41.890 --> 51:44.347
[man crying]

51:44.435 --> 51:48.394
[drowning
and screaming]

51:48.522 --> 51:50.979
[toilet flushing]

52:23.432 --> 52:25.423
A double Irish.

52:25.559 --> 52:28.221
Can't do, buddy.
I'm closed.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.767
Listen up. I'm only
gonna say this once.
I ain't your 'buddy.'

52:35.819 --> 52:39.027
When I ask
for a drink, you say,
"Ice with that, sir?"

52:39.114 --> 52:41.651
Now let's begin again.
A double Irish.

52:41.700 --> 52:46.069
[background police radio]

52:46.163 --> 52:48.324
You want ice
with that, sir?

52:48.415 --> 52:51.498
Don't be ridiculous.
Who needs ice?

52:51.585 --> 52:54.543
[pouring]

52:54.630 --> 52:57.838
That’ll be five quid, sir.

52:57.925 --> 52:59.790
Like you said...

52:59.885 --> 53:02.501
you're closed.

53:02.638 --> 53:06.096
(Dunlop)
He went to the toilet.
When he hadn't come back...

53:06.141 --> 53:07.096
I got concerned.
I thought he fell in.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.382
He did.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.134
(Nash)
Then what happened?

53:10.229 --> 53:12.720
Well, I went in there,
didn't l? I found him.

53:12.856 --> 53:16.098
(Brant)
Well, you didn't
exactly come rushing out
though, did you, Mr. Dunlop?

53:16.193 --> 53:18.809
The man at the bar says
you was with him
for ten minutes.

53:18.904 --> 53:21.611
Had you down as a couple
of George Michael fans.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.564
Hey, I was looking
for the money.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.069
Money?

53:25.160 --> 53:26.696
(Dunlop)
The paper's money.

53:26.787 --> 53:27.993
We were paying him
for an exclusive.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.116
Oh, for fuck's sake.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.617
Can I remind you
that people...

53:31.709 --> 53:32.573
are being killed
here, Mr. Dunlop?

53:32.668 --> 53:34.499
Ah, yeah?

53:34.586 --> 53:37.043
Yeah. Human beings,
with families and children.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.838
There's a car. Yeah.
Oh, God, I forgot.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.133
Yeah. A car.
You're not gonna
believe what's inside.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.085
Where is this car?

53:45.180 --> 53:47.592
Weymouth Street car park.
It's a black Jaguar.

53:47.683 --> 53:48.843
Bay 23!

53:52.062 --> 53:55.020
Oy! Am I gonna get
police protection?

53:55.107 --> 53:56.643
Oh, yeah.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.726
We'll be all over you.

53:59.820 --> 54:02.357
Should've been
the other guy
had him killed.

54:02.448 --> 54:05.565
[incidental music]

54:11.999 --> 54:13.580
What now?

54:21.717 --> 54:24.049
Murder inquiry.
I want the disc
for the last month.

54:24.136 --> 54:25.421
(man)
Discs are full.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.294
What do you mean
they’re full?

54:27.389 --> 54:29.926
(man)
They haven't recorded
anything for six weeks.

54:30.017 --> 54:32.133
It ran out of memory.
They'll fix it Monday.

54:32.227 --> 54:34.309
I don't believe this.

54:34.396 --> 54:37.763
The cameras are
really turned on.
It's psychological.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.019
(Nash)
You don't give
a shit, do ya?

54:40.110 --> 54:43.602
It's disgraceful.

54:43.697 --> 54:48.532
So is you eating it.

54:48.619 --> 54:52.328
[pop music]

55:13.268 --> 55:16.101
[suspenseful music]

55:16.188 --> 55:17.724
(Stokes)
Hey.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.897
You look nice.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.143
(Falls)
Thanks.

55:21.235 --> 55:22.395
Can I take
your coat?

55:22.528 --> 55:24.143
Yeah.

55:28.534 --> 55:30.365
Thank you.

55:30.452 --> 55:32.158
Have a seat.

55:32.246 --> 55:34.953
[suspenseful
music intensifies]

55:41.421 --> 55:43.753
[mouthing silently]

55:58.522 --> 56:00.058
You've gone quiet.

56:00.148 --> 56:03.015
I like
listening to you.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.590
Everything all right?

56:28.677 --> 56:30.542
There's got to be
an easier way to do this.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.343
Fuck, Brant.

56:32.431 --> 56:34.547
So how does it feel
to actually need
us girls...

56:34.683 --> 56:39.017
for more
than just cooking
and cleaning and shagging?

56:39.104 --> 56:43.814
I was sorting a way
of listing all Weiss'
arresting officers.

56:43.901 --> 56:47.109
I've seemed to pull up
the first one. It's
WPC Sandra Bates.

56:47.195 --> 56:49.436
[incidental music]

56:49.573 --> 56:50.779
You're kidding.

56:55.662 --> 56:57.823
I've had
a really nice time.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.246
Yeah.

56:59.333 --> 57:01.790
[engine continues]

57:03.962 --> 57:06.328
I'll call you.

57:10.093 --> 57:13.051
[clears throat]
When?

57:13.138 --> 57:16.630
When are you
gonna call me?

57:16.725 --> 57:18.511
Tomorrow.

57:18.602 --> 57:20.433
I'll tell you what.
How about this summer...

57:20.562 --> 57:23.224
we'll do a picnic?

57:23.315 --> 57:27.354
Don't you think
I know how this goes?

57:27.444 --> 57:29.435
Man says,
"I'll call you"...

57:29.571 --> 57:31.732
and a woman's waiting
and hoping.

57:31.823 --> 57:33.905
She's a slave
to her mobile...

57:33.992 --> 57:36.654
while he's thinking,
"Well, I'll call her...

57:36.745 --> 57:41.660
tomorrow, some day,
Monday. Doesn't matter.
Well, here's a hint, yeah?

57:41.750 --> 57:44.708
It matters.
It matters a lot.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.831
Tomorrow. I'll
call you tomorrow.

57:46.922 --> 57:48.378
No, fuck off.

57:48.507 --> 57:49.371
Hey!

57:49.508 --> 57:50.623
[shuts door]

57:50.717 --> 57:55.006
[suspenseful music]

57:59.351 --> 58:01.842
Jesus. Look who else.

58:01.937 --> 58:03.893
[gunshot]

58:03.981 --> 58:06.973
[suspenseful music]

58:07.067 --> 58:09.524
[engine accelerating]

58:15.117 --> 58:17.529
Fuck. That's Roberts.

58:17.619 --> 58:18.904
(Brant)
And Falls.

58:18.996 --> 58:20.736
[suspenseful music]

58:20.831 --> 58:23.493
Shit. How could l
be that stupid?

58:23.583 --> 58:27.667
Send an armed response
unit round to her flat
straight away.

58:27.754 --> 58:29.119
It's a 1 9.

58:29.214 --> 58:31.580
Come on, Falls.
We're coming.

58:31.675 --> 58:34.132
[phone ringing]
Oh.

58:34.219 --> 58:35.925
Oh, shit.

58:36.013 --> 58:40.222
[phone ringing]
I'm stupid.
I'm stupid.

58:40.308 --> 58:42.173
[screaming and thump]

58:50.694 --> 58:52.059
[Weiss shouting]
What the fuck?

58:52.154 --> 58:53.234
What the fuck?

58:56.450 --> 58:57.690
Ugh!

58:57.784 --> 58:58.899
[groans]

58:58.994 --> 59:00.154
[screaming]

59:00.245 --> 59:01.360
[loud crack]

59:01.455 --> 59:03.446
[sirens wailing]

59:03.540 --> 59:04.825
Not--

59:10.672 --> 59:12.754
[sirens wailing louder]

59:26.063 --> 59:28.805
[screaming]

59:28.899 --> 59:31.515
[background police radio
and incidental music]

59:38.075 --> 59:39.906
[camera shutter clicks]

59:46.374 --> 59:49.662
Doctors have given her
a sedative. She should
be out for a while.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.584
Did she get a look
at the attacker?

59:51.671 --> 59:54.208
All she could say for sure
is that he's big and white.

59:54.299 --> 59:56.130
Big and white.

59:56.218 --> 59:59.335
So it's not
the black kid
from Different Strokes.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.592
It's Barry Weiss.
I know him.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:05.139
Should you be
taking her booze?

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.309
[pouring]
Well, she
won't notice.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:08.635
Want one?

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.595
Yeah.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.851
[sighs]

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.859
[panting]
Is she all right?

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.902
(Nash)
Who are you?

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.650
DI Craig Stokes.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.280
I heard someone
got killed.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.904
It's not Falls.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:24.575
Cop killer
took a run at her.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.324
Some kid jumped in,
a hoodie.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:29.247
He got his ticket punched.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.541
(Nash)
Were you
with Falls this evening?

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:35.371
Yes. We went
for a drink and
I dropped her off.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.293
You dropped her
in it, you mean.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:41.676
Did it not occur
to you to walk her
to the door?

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.596
What agent.

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.548
[incidental music]

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.936
Taxi!

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:56.562
(Weiss)
Can you take me
to Bayswater?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:57.859
[shuts door]

01:00:57.946 --> 01:00:59.356
It's gonna
cost you, mate.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:00.903
Hey, Bronski Beat.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.731
Do I look like
the kind of cunt...

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:05.317
who thinks
Bayswater is just
around the corner?

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:08.028
[suspenseful music]

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.790
Hey, stop here.
Stop here, mate.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:18.588
There. Dean Court.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.718
[Weiss, chuckles]
All right.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:24.965
Yeah, all right.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:26.546
There you go.
Keep it.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:35.393
[woman over TV]
1,000 pounds.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:40.607
And question two.
We wanted to know the
post code for BIair Castle.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.154
Don't know how many
of you ever visited
Blair Castle.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.330
Is he dead?

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:02.791
What, the little skinhead?

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:06.299
It was a doornail.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:21.150
What's the story
with you and him?

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:25.356
Him risking
his life for ya.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:29.284
Oh, I've known him
since he was twelve.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:33.865
He used to live
next door.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.585
When I came out of rehab,
he was the only one around
here I wanted to know.

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:43.086
He made me tea.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.337
I don't know.
I thought...

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.669
I could help him.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:52.224
Oh, my God.

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.892
[sobbing]

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.767
Brant.

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.974
[crying]

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:10.192
[suspenseful music]

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.911
[blast]

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:31.763
He definitely
did a bunk.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.386
Find anything?

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:36.225
Nothing incriminating, no.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:40.347
(Nash)
Used to be
a good looking boy.
He let himself go a bit.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.434
Let's go public
with Weiss.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.061
Your call.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.863
At least we'll flush
the fucker out.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.744
[man over TV}
Police today released
a picture of the suspect...

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.368
they would like to question
regarding The Blitz.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:59.916
Yeah! I know him!

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.336
I dropped the guy off.
He was fucking psycho.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.172
[tires screeching]

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:12.128
[suspenseful music]

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:15.845

Long time, no see.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.220
(Nash)
Hey.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:20.145
Jack, this is
Detective Brant.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:21.346
Hello, mate.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.601
Where's our boy?

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.273
Room 7.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.818
[suspenseful music continues]

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.655
(Jack)
Go, go, go.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.282
[thump]

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.539
Fuck!

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.997
(Brant)
He's on the move.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:48.707
Let's go.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:50.292
[curtain music]

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.546
[horn honking]

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:31.215
[thump]
Ugh.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.970
[man over radio]
We have him on the Great
Western Road.

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:38.511
(Nash)
Head down to Harrow Road.
We 'Il put him off
at the underpass.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.167
[horns honking,
tires screeching]

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.711
[man over radio]
Now running west
on the Westway.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.136

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:20.424

[policeman over radio]
Heading towards Paddington.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.067
Suspect entering
train depot...

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:37.240
north of Paddington.
Brant still in pursuit.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.158
[sirens]

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.405
(Nash)
All units
head for train depot...

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.449
north of Paddington.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:46.158
Do not let B rant engage.
Repeat. Do not let
Brant engage.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.164
[sirens and music stop]

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:56.877

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.735

[curtain music recommences]

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.518
What the fuck--
[thump}

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:49.391
(Nash)
Leave it, Brant.

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.856
(Nash)
Brant, calm down.
We've got him.

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.228
(Brant)
Get the fuck--

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.184
(Brant)
Fuck!

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.362
(Nash)
Get this piece
of shit out of here.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:07:58.813
Just calm down.
Calm down.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.899
Move! Now!

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:02.575
We've got him.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.077
We've got
him, okay?
We've got him.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:06.745
[choppers flying]

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:11.247
[incidental music]

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:18.379
[female on TV]
The Metropolitan Police
have just confirmed...

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:21.594
the arrest of Barry
Weiss, the prime suspect
in The Blitz killings...

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:25.136
in which three London Police
officers were murdered
in cold blood...

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:28.093
after a dramatic chase
through West London--

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:29.723
[scream and crack]

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:32.100
A t the Paddington
train depot.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:35.058
Police are refusing
to comment any further--

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.285
(Falls)
Just selling
records, yeah?

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:31.573
(Nash)
We're going
to record this.
Okay, Barry?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:43.301
I want a lawyer
and a sandwich.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:47.848
Oh, and I want to update
my Facebook status.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:49.890
(lawyer)
You have exactly
forty-eight hours.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:53.845
In that time,
you either charge
my client or release him.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:06.317
And he'd like
a different sandwich.
He says the bread is stale.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.244
(Nash)
Weiss might be crazy
but he's not stupid.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.366
He's covered
his tracks.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.415
The fire at Roberts'
flat destroyed any
forensic evidence...

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:17.369
we might have had.
Even the Peacock
Gym link is tenuous.

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:19.959
(Nash)
Well, he's admitted
the Jag belongs to him.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.290
It's been
sitting in a car park
for at least six months.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:25.172
Anyone could've
had access to it.
There's no CCTT.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:29.882
(Brant)
I got ahold of the guy
with the dogs, the one that
saw the first murder.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.888
Now he's saying he can't
make a positive I D.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:36.387
All right, de 's too scared.
Same goes for the barman
at the Wellesley.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.185
(Superintendent)
You didn't find
anything at the hotel?

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.356
Nothing.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:40.809
What about Forensics?

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:43.228
Team stripped
it down, but no.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.779
With what we've got,
he'll be out tomorrow
laughing his head off.

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:47.403
We need something solid.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.617
We'd better come up
with something quick.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:52.950
Otherwise, the killer
is gonna hop, skip
and jump out of here.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.747
The only thing he's getting
so far is a caution.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:59.373
[incidental music]

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.387
[dialing]

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.897
All right, Babe?

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:25.354
Yeah. Yeah, no. I've been
away, but...

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.734
I'm back now.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.316
Do you want to come
to my party?

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:34.700
[exhaling]
Yeah, like old times.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.749
Can you take care
of me?

01:11:37.835 --> 01:11:39.746
Sweet.

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:44.046
[walla]

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.418
What's this?

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.258
Moonshine.
Irish moonshine.

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:49.756
Isn't this
stuff illegal?

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:52.054
I fucking hope so.

01:11:52.099 --> 01:11:54.590
You drink this poison
and then you wonder
why you get blackouts.

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:57.347
I drink this poison
because I get blackouts.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:58.644
Sláinte.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:00.096
Cheers.

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:09.447
Say we
can't prove anything.
Say Barry Weiss walks.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:11.531
Where are you
going with this?

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.452
Well, you told
me once before
about some pedophile.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.698
You couldn't
get the bastard through
the regular channels, so...

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.409
you took him out yourself.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:25.167
I thought you were asleep
when I told you that.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:28.250
I'm not gonna continue
this line of talk.

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:31.009
I don't like
where it's going.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.396
Been a busy couple
of days for you, Barry.

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:53.241
Took a ride in a police car.
Got your picture in the paper.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:57.115
Highlight of your career.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:00.869
You know, Barry,
if you were smart...

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.542
which I know you're not...

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:06.416
you'd admit to what you did...

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:10.800
because I'm gonna tell
you now, you'll be a lot
safer in here than out there.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:13.549
Were they
friends of yours...

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:16.381
those cops
that got killed?

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:21.887
[suspenseful music]

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:25.727
You see...

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.151
I know what this
is about, Barry.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:37.322
(Brant)
What did those lads
ever do to you, Barry?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:41.326
Of course, you knew.
How did you react?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.908
Fuck you, pig.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:47.040
(Brant)
They call that
resisting arrest.

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:49.998
I call it stupid.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:56.008
[incidental music]

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.680
I know I embarrassed you.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.594
Since then you've stewed...

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:07.398
and cooked
and simmered over it.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:10.017
[sighs]

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:14.731
You should've just let it go.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.082
Personally...

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:30.289
I didn't remember until
I saw you. Didn't give it
a second thought.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:34.422
It was so insignificant,
I forgot all about it.

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:39.263
We sure all laughed when
I played the surveillance
tapes at the station.

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:44.219
We all did.
But that stuff's silly.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:47.851
[men chuckling]

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.061
Sergeant Brant
to you.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:55.522
[men continue chuckling]

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:58.107
The point is, Barry...

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.944
you're nothing.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:09.373
No one cares.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.963
No one gives a fuck.

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:15.883
[suspenseful music]

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.552
Oh, and another thing.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:22.928
You, The Blitz.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.351
What the fuck is that?

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.521
[scoffs]

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:36.733

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:16.273
[pop music]

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.529
Don't mean to bomb
you out, bro...

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.118
but there's some major
shit going down.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:29.665
I'm listening.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.288
A cop's ripped off
a dealer.

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:33.039
What?

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.212
They're getting
into the products, man.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.255
This dealer is like
serious folks.

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:41.677
You fuck with him
and he gets difficult,
even with a woman.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.972
Whoa. Whoa.
Back up a second.

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.550
A female cop
is ripping off
drug dealers?

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:51.012
She a sister, too.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.768
This cop
have a name?

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.769
Yeah. Falls.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.148
[dialing]

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.697
Brant. It's Stokes.
Listen, I need your help.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:10.372
I think she's inside.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:15.377
[very loud music]

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:18.664
You crashed
a party, man.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:22.047
"You crashed
a party?" You
fucking-- Get him out!

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.594
Come here.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:25.091
[shouting]

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:31.057
[mumbles unintelligibly]

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:33.308
[loud music continues]

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:35.981
Do you like me?
If you like me--

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:40.277
[continues mumbling]

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:41.900
Look at this shit.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:47.156
If you like me,
you can throw me a party.

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:48.702
[indistinct]

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:51.280
What are you doing?
I don't wanna go!

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:54.037
[shouting]
Go back.
He's gonna kill me!

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:57.370
He's gonna kill me!
No! He's gonna kill me!

01:17:57.506 --> 01:18:00.873
[shouting and crying]
No!

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:02.879
He's gonna kill me!

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:32.621
What are these?

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:35.495
Thanks. They’ll
bring you down.

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.749
The shower did that.

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:42.002
Just take 'em, Falls.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.971
[incidental music]

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.683
I'm messed up,
aren't l?

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:02.310
Even when I was
working undercover...

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.395
I was a cop
pretending to be a junkie.

01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:08.115
But really, I'm just a junkie
playing at being a cop.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:14.956
He's gonna get away
with it, isn't he?

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:20.161
If we can't protect our own,
what good are we, Brant?

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.962
What good are we?

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:54.620
A lot
of press waiting?

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:58.206
Yes, I'm afraid so.
There's quiet a crowd
gathered outside the front.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.377
But we can leave
through a different
exit, if you prefer.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:03.037
Fuck no!

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.839
I hope it's all there.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:21.730
Is something
on your mind, Barry?

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:26.060
Well, I guess I'll
see you another day.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:28.237
I can't wait.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.282
[crowd exclaiming]

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:33.859
[curtain music]

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:04.849
Don't worry. We're
having him tailed
around the clock.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.767
Keep him
out of trouble.

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:17.740
[suspenseful music]

01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:22.200
[mumbling]

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:31.083
(policeman)
We're in position now.
He's going into his flat.

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:37.089
[knocking]

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.598
[door opens]

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:57.158
Is Brant still here?

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:59.077
No. No, he left.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.246
It's Roberts' funeral
this afternoon.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.870
Every cop in the Southeast
is gonna be there.

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:05.792
Except you.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:13.004
[suspenseful music]

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.148
[rainfall]

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.446
[sad music]

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.817
(priest)
In company with Christ
who died and now lives...

01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.742
may the rejoicing
in Your Kingdom...

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:42.572
where all our tears
are wiped away...

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:46.158
unite us together again
in one family...

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.790
to sing Your praise
forever and ever.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:50.917
Amen.

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:58.841
Eternal rest grant
unto him, Oh, Lord...

01:22:58.932 --> 01:23:02.925
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:06.512
[ominous music]

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:09.644
(priest)
into Your hand,
Father of Mercy...

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:13.728
we commend our brother
in sure and certain hope...

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.317
that together, all who
have died in Christ...

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:19.525
will live with Him one day.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.238
In nomine Patris,
Filii et Spiritu
Sancti. Amen.

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:36.884
Beloved Bruce Roberts,
we give your body
to the earth.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.552
Earth Mother,
Root Mother...

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.676
Father of soil.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:46.261
We give You this body
of our beloved Bruce Roberts.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.142
His eyes will never
greet us again.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:51.349
Return to earth.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:54.150
We will not kiss these lops.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:56.229
Return to earth.

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:59.065
[thunder
and suspenseful music]

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.621
What he has been is gone.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.418
What he is now
has passed the gate...

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:16.081
leaving his body
to become soil.
[suspenseful music
intensifies]

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.667
This flesh
to nurture flowers...

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:22.675
these bones
to be roots of trees.

01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:56.837
[suspenseful music continues]

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.233
Come on.

01:25:45.432 --> 01:25:48.674
[phone ringing]

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.226
(Brant)
Yeah, what's the latest?

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.725
(policeman)
Weiss hasn't left
his flat all day.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:57.849
[mumbles unintelligibly]

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.320
Fuck.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:03.943
[suspenseful music continues]

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:46.903
[clicks]

01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:48.984
[suspenseful music
intensifies]

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.889
[sirens wailing
far away]

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.406
[suspenseful music continues]

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:08.196
Brant! Turn around,
you fucker!

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.899
I wanna see your face
as your head explodes.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:20.659
Ugh. Agh.

01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:25.334
[groaning]

01:28:25.425 --> 01:28:28.633
[panting]
What? You think
you fooled me?

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.384
No chance. I was
just playing along.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:34.677
Ugh!

01:28:39.689 --> 01:28:41.805
Ugh!
[groaning]

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.273
[growling
and groaning]

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:50.356
Come on, Barry.

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:51.986
What are you
gonna do?

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.617
Huh? Call
the cops?

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:10.049
[spitting]

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:14.004
You stupid fucking pig.

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:17.762
Wait till the papers
get a load of this, hey.

01:29:17.853 --> 01:29:19.844
I'm gonna sue you.

01:29:19.938 --> 01:29:21.303
And you.

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:24.890
And all of you
fucking pig cunts.

01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:28.352
I'm gonna make
fucking millions.

01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:31.028
[suspenseful music continues]

01:29:31.116 --> 01:29:32.856
You fucking--

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:34.612
(Nash)
Brant?

01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:40.997
You fuck.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:43.416
You can't kill me.

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:46.332
I'm The Blitz.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:49.043
Are you talking
about that cop killer?

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:52.046
That can't be you, Barry.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:55.550
We tried to convict you
but you were innocent.

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:59.846
The only thing we do know
is he was partial to
people in uniform...

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:02.678
just like the one
you're wearing.

01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:06.640
And he used a weapon
just like this one.

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:36.799
Fucking lucky
he didn't shoot
me in the head.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:54.317
Something tells me
this one's gonna
remain unsolved.

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:01.820
You're not supposed
to smoke in here.

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:04.031
What you gonna do?

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.831
Shoot me?

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.998
[Dunlop, chuckling]
I'm just leaving
the office now, darling.

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:14.834
Yeah, I'll be back at 7:00.
I love you too, Amanda. Yeah.

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:16.509
[dogs growling
and barking]

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:19.212
There he is.
There's Brecky.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.342
Fuck.

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:22.048
Bon appétit.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.850
[shouting and barking]

01:31:24.938 --> 01:31:26.849
(Dunlop)
Get out! Get away!

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:30.228
[shouting and barking]

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.104
