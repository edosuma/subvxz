03:22.040 --> 03:24.930
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, all right.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.764
Will you hurry up?

03:38.040 --> 03:39.849
I'm home.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.570
Afternoon, Miss Edna.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.484
Penny, your mother called.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.849
Tracy Turnblad, can't you
say hello to Mrs. Malinski?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.445
Mm, mm, mm.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.844
Every day she's got to watch that
<i>Corny Collins Show.</i>

03:53.040 --> 03:54.929
Delinquents, if you ask me.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.368
It ain't right to be dancing
on TV to that colored music.

03:58.520 --> 04:01.330
- She's just a teenager.
- Hmph.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.725
- Goodbye, Mrs. Malinski.
- Goodbye, Edna.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.367
<i>Mashed Potato
Feel it in your feet now</i>

04:13.560 --> 04:16.608
<i>Mashed Potato
Come on get the beat now</i>

04:16.760 --> 04:22.005
<i>Baby, come on honey,
come on baby</i>

04:23.720 --> 04:25.802
Could you turn that racket down?

04:25.960 --> 04:29.885
I'm trying to iron in here.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.482
<i>They found this dance
was outta sight</i>

04:35.640 --> 04:39.725
<i>Doin' the lion sleeps tonight</i>

04:39.920 --> 04:45.404
<i>Mashed Potato</i>

04:47.520 --> 04:48.567
Woo, yeah

04:48.760 --> 04:51.445
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Corny Collins.</i>

04:51.680 --> 04:54.604
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome
to <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

04:57.200 --> 04:58.964
That was Dee Dee Sharp
and today's...

04:59.120 --> 05:01.000
Thwip. ...Bull's-eye hit,
"Mashed Potato Time."

05:02.360 --> 05:04.522
We've got our first
telegram of the day.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.200
Thank you very much, Tammy.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.284
"Please have Lou Ann Levorowski
and I.Q. Jones lead a dance."

05:10.440 --> 05:12.727
Signed, "your number one fan
in West Baltimore."

05:12.880 --> 05:14.644
Here they come.
Come up here, kids.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.484
- Hi, Corny.
- Hi, West Baltimore.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.962
You're a groovy chick. How long have
you been a regular on the show?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.828
I've been on the
Council for five months.

05:21.854 --> 05:22.625
And you, I.Q.?

05:22.800 --> 05:23.881
Two out-of-sight years.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.321
Heh, not bad.

05:26.480 --> 05:28.562
God, he's gorgeous, Penny.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.807
- Look at her hair.
- Aah!

05:29.960 --> 05:31.480
Gosh, I wish mine was that high.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.887
<i>And what's your favorite
record from the survey?</i>

05:34.040 --> 05:35.371
<i>"Gravy."</i>

05:35.560 --> 05:38.131
<i>All right, here's I. Q. Jones
and Lou Ann Levorowski...</i>

05:38.280 --> 05:41.250
<i>leading our next dance,
Give Me Gravy on my Mashed Potatoes.</i>

05:44.160 --> 05:46.970
<i>I need gravy
Give me, give me</i>

05:47.120 --> 05:49.441
<i>Give me, give me gravy tonight</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:53.161
<i>I knew you danced
The mashed potato fine</i>

05:53.320 --> 05:56.369
<i>But that don't show me
That you're really mine</i>

05:57.120 --> 06:00.090
<i>What's with dancin'
Without romancin'?</i>

06:00.240 --> 06:03.847
<i>So put that somethin'
extra on the line</i>

06:04.000 --> 06:06.924
<i>Give me gravy
On my mashed potatoes</i>

06:07.080 --> 06:10.846
<i>Give me gravy
Come on and treat me right</i>

06:11.000 --> 06:14.721
<i>Give me gravy
You're the greatest</i>

06:14.880 --> 06:19.488
<i>So give me, give me
Give me, give me gravy tonight</i>

06:23.240 --> 06:25.720
Link, tell the home viewers
where we'll be tonight.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.121
Well, Corny, we'll be
at the Parkville VFW.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.482
For the Corny Collins Record Hop.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.211
Stuck-up little spastic.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.805
She's such a queer.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.725
<i>Parkville VFW, 8:00.
What do you want to hear, Amber?</i>

06:37.880 --> 06:40.281
"Shake a Tail Feather"
by The Five Du-Tones.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.283
Here they are, The Five Du-Tones.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.168
<i>I heard about the fella
You've been dancin' with</i>

06:53.320 --> 06:56.085
<i>All over the neighborhood</i>

06:56.240 --> 06:59.323
<i>So why didn't you ask me, baby?</i>

06:59.520 --> 07:02.091
<i>Or didn't you think I could?</i>

07:02.240 --> 07:05.403
<i>I know that the Bossa Nova's
Outta sight</i>

07:05.560 --> 07:08.086
<i>I've seen him do
the Bird all night</i>

07:08.280 --> 07:11.329
<i>But, if that was you and me
Out there, baby</i>

07:11.480 --> 07:14.689
<i>I would have shown you
How to do it right</i>

07:14.840 --> 07:15.588
<i>Do it right</i>

07:21.640 --> 07:29.640
<i>Bend over
Let me see you shake a tail feather</i>

07:33.600 --> 07:39.004
<i>Twistin'! Shake-it, shake-it, shake-it
Shake-it, baby</i>

07:39.160 --> 07:41.367
You should be on
that council, not her.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.962
I know I should, Penny.
Hey, I'm going to that hop tonight.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.602
Oh, let me come. We'll lie and say
we're going to the library to study.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.285
- It's a deal, heh.
- Heh.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.966
- We'll meet 8:00, up on the avenue.
- Heh.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.966
Okay, young ladies. I've had just
about enough of this screeching music.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.561
Mother, we're watching
<i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

08:00.520 --> 08:02.568
Penny,
your mother called all frantic.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.131
She said you are punished.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.884
I'm always punished.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.566
And Tracy, I have told
you about that hair...

08:08.720 --> 08:11.530
all ratted up like
a teenage Jezebel.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.603
Oh, Mother,
you're so '50s.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.003
Tracy's flamboyant flip
is all the rage, Miss Edna.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.209
Jackie Kennedy, our first lady,
even rats her hair.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.364
But Tracy ain't no
first lady, are you, Tracy?

08:23.560 --> 08:27.042
No, sirree, she's a hairhopper.
That's what she is.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.647
Now, I've got nothing but
hampers of ironing to do...

08:30.800 --> 08:33.041
and my diet pill is wearing off.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.602
Tracy, I want you to go
to your room and study.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.568
And Penny,
don't you be listening...

08:38.720 --> 08:41.121
to every bit of nonsense
my daughter tells you.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.770
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear she was mental.

08:46.160 --> 08:50.165
Now what? More soiled laundry
for Mommy, I suppose.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.243
Come in.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.482
Edna, have you seen Penny?

08:54.640 --> 08:56.961
Good Lord, Prudy,
she's right over there.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.321
Hi, Mom.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.245
Penny Pingleton,
you know you were punished.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.041
From now on, you're wearing a giant P
on your blouse every day to school...

09:06.200 --> 09:10.444
so that the whole world knows that
Penny Pingleton is permanently...

09:10.600 --> 09:12.409
positively punished.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.887
Eight o'clock.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.088
- Bye, Miss Edna.
- Bye, honey.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.608
I said no.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.329
- Oh, stop. Stop, unh.
- What is it? What is it?

10:34.480 --> 10:36.289
Unh, oh, my God.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.122
- Amber, what's the matter?
- No, get off of me.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.130
- Don't look at me.
- Whoa, what's the matter? Amber.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.405
What's the matter?

10:49.560 --> 10:52.040
I happen to have a blemish.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.047
You had three good
close-ups today, period.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.010
Why can't you dance up front
where the voters can see you?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.924
Leave me alone, Mother.
I have a pimple.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.402
Heh, you had to choose a colored
record as your favorite song?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.409
That's nice for the neighbors.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.921
You got something against
Connie Francis?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.366
Shelley Fabares?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.449
- I love Shelley Fabares.
- Oh.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.489
Amber, Amber.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.324
Are you listening to me?

11:18.680 --> 11:21.411
We have to have a little talk.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.564
You know, if your father is
forced to integrate Tilted Acres...

11:24.720 --> 11:26.165
we're out of business.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.971
So at least act
white on television.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.286
Leave me alone, Mother.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.568
"Shake a Tail Feather"
is a wild song.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.927
It's got a good beat
and you can dance to it.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.286
Oh, God, of all nights.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.808
A Corny Collins record hop,
and I've got craters.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.327
Unh, just pop it. Pop it.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.323
Just relax. Relax.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.131
Don't be ridiculous.
Take it easy.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.250
Tension is the worst thing
for a complexion.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.846
Come on. Lie down. Lie down.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.604
No moping.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.602
Mother is here.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.046
You have beautiful skin, Amber.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.763
There. It's gone.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.322
<i>Now it's time for you-know-what</i>

12:12.480 --> 12:14.767
Mother, I know all the dances.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.169
Come on. Get up. Get up.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.004
- Practice makes perfect.
- Ugh.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.924
I ought to know.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.050
Don't forget, I was
Miss Soft Crab in 1945.

12:25.240 --> 12:29.040
And that title wasn't handed to me
on a silver platter. I worked for it.

12:29.200 --> 12:34.650
Now come on. A one, two,
a one, two, three, pony.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.441
Mash potatoes.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.929
Faster.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.244
Amber, I'd like to talk to you.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.806
Yes, Daddy?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.764
Don't stop. Cha-cha.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.287
- I'm tired.
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.010
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

12:54.160 --> 13:00.566
I had some new campaign fliers made up
today, all for Daddy's little girl.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.929
Now, I want you to hand those out
at the hop tonight to everyone.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.923
Each and every one of those.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.321
- Twist.
- Oh, Daddy, ugh.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.131
No lip from you, Miss ingrate.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.647
This campaign is costing us
an arm and a leg.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.929
New gowns,
hairdresser three times a week.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.130
Your hairspray bill alone is enough to eat
up all the profits from the Tilt-A-Whirl.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.847
Do as Daddy says or we'll send you
to Catholic school where you belong.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.401
- Right, Franklin?
- That's right. Catholic school.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.967
Pass the macaroni
and cheese, please.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.767
Did you take that appetite suppressant
I gave you on Dr. McKenzie's orders?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.440
Mother, I'm a growing teenager.
I need food.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.690
Let her eat, Edna.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.565
Tracy, did you do your chores
around the house today?

13:45.360 --> 13:48.204
Not Miss Tracy,
Cyd Charisse herself.

13:48.360 --> 13:52.490
She's too busy ratting her hair
and doing the Ubangi stomp.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.725
Tracy, we all have
responsibilities in life.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.884
You may think owning the Hardy
Har joke shop is all drudgery...

14:00.040 --> 14:03.362
unwrapping dribble glasses,
checking doggie doo inventory...

14:03.520 --> 14:04.646
but I love it.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.326
You'll see. Work can be fun.

14:09.480 --> 14:13.166
Can I please be excused to go
to the library to study?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.287
<i>Let's have a ball
at the hall tonight</i>

14:19.440 --> 14:22.649
<i>Boot it girl till
the early bright</i>

14:22.840 --> 14:27.846
<i>Make a scene with the record machine
At the dancin' party tonight</i>

14:28.000 --> 14:29.968
<i>Come on let's try
mashed potatoes too</i>

14:30.120 --> 14:31.451
What's the problem, officer?

14:31.640 --> 14:33.802
- This is a white establishment.
- Oh, come on.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.281
Hey, listen,
we just came to dance.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.209
- That's not fair.
- Open your purse, please.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.000
<i>And everything's all right</i>

14:46.320 --> 14:49.449
Go. Go.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.924
<i>Mess around, Bristol Stompin' too</i>

14:54.120 --> 14:56.407
<i>Pony now like it's all brand new</i>

14:56.560 --> 14:58.847
<i>Any dance that you wanna do</i>

15:04.640 --> 15:08.486
Boys and girls, stay on the dance floor.
Here comes the hottest tune of the day.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.166
And it started right
here in Baltimore.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.326
And where did you
see it first, kids?

15:18.560 --> 15:21.689
<i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

15:21.880 --> 15:26.841
A big strong line, ladies and
gentlemen. It's "Madison Time."

15:27.880 --> 15:29.086
I can do that dance.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.845
<i>It's Madison time, hit it</i>

15:40.000 --> 15:43.209
<i>You're lookin' good
A big strong line</i>

15:45.320 --> 15:48.403
<i>When I say hit it I want you
to go two up and two back</i>

15:48.560 --> 15:52.087
<i>With a big strong turn
and back to the Madison</i>

15:53.080 --> 15:54.127
<i>Hit it</i>

15:54.280 --> 15:57.045
No, you dance better than
all of them. Go ahead. Go.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.446
<i>You're lookin' good</i>

16:02.200 --> 16:05.568
<i>Now when I say hit it I want
you to go two up and two back</i>

16:05.720 --> 16:09.441
<i>Double cross
Come out of it with the rifleman</i>

16:10.440 --> 16:12.169
<i>Hit it</i>

16:22.080 --> 16:23.605
Crazy

16:23.760 --> 16:26.240
<i>Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong "M"</i>

16:26.400 --> 16:28.971
<i>Erase it,
and back to the Madison</i>

16:30.400 --> 16:32.050
<i>Hit it</i>

16:35.960 --> 16:37.724
<i>Walk on, you're lookin' good</i>

16:46.480 --> 16:50.326
<i>Now then when I say hit it
It'll be "T" time</i>

16:53.040 --> 16:54.485
<i>Hit it</i>

17:01.560 --> 17:02.607
<i>Big strong line</i>

17:03.800 --> 17:06.723
<i>Now when I say hit it
I want the big strong basketball</i>

17:06.920 --> 17:09.491
<i>With the Wilt Chamberlain hook</i>

17:12.480 --> 17:14.005
<i>Hit it</i>

17:15.280 --> 17:17.203
<i>Two points</i>

17:19.760 --> 17:21.967
<i>Now this time when I say hit it</i>

17:22.119 --> 17:25.761
<i>I want the big strong Jackie Gleason
And back to the Madison</i>

17:27.760 --> 17:29.125
<i>Hit it</i>

17:31.400 --> 17:33.050
<i>And away we go</i>

17:34.760 --> 17:35.841
Crazy

17:36.000 --> 17:39.561
<i>When I say hit it, go two up
and two back double cross and freeze</i>

17:39.720 --> 17:41.165
<i>Hit it</i>

17:47.840 --> 17:50.684
<i>And hold it right there</i>

17:57.360 --> 18:00.364
All right. Hold on to your hats,
all you continental rockers...

18:00.520 --> 18:04.570
because it's dance contest time,
and we've got the wildest judge in town.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.042
You listen to her every night on WEDD
and she hosts Negro Day...

18:08.200 --> 18:11.204
on <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>
The last Thursday of every month.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.529
A warm welcome for the queen
of Baltimore soul...

18:14.680 --> 18:17.968
Miss Motormouth Maybelle herself,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.044
Let's hear it, Baltimore.
Motormouth Maybelle.

18:21.240 --> 18:25.529
All right, here she comes,
looking very fine.

18:25.720 --> 18:31.409
Ooh, wee, tiddley papa,
I am a whopper.

18:33.600 --> 18:40.722
Motormouth Maybelle is my name
and, sweetheart, dancing is my game.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.971
Motormouth, Motormouth,
Motormouth.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.281
All right.

18:46.440 --> 18:50.525
Chubby Checker and "Pony Time."

18:54.280 --> 19:00.287
<i>Hey now let's party
In the union hall</i>

19:00.440 --> 19:05.128
<i>It's pony time
When you hear this call</i>

19:06.560 --> 19:10.451
<i>So get with it
Don't quit it</i>

19:10.600 --> 19:12.489
<i>Get up</i>

19:12.640 --> 19:15.723
Okay, fatso, let's see
what you're made of.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.969
<i>With a big boss line</i>

19:19.120 --> 19:22.010
<i>Well anyway you do it</i>

19:22.160 --> 19:23.924
<i>You're gonna look real fine</i>

19:25.160 --> 19:29.051
<i>So get with it
Don't quit it</i>

19:29.200 --> 19:30.964
<i>Get up</i>

19:32.200 --> 19:35.647
<i>Now you turn to the left
When I say gee</i>

19:35.800 --> 19:38.371
<i>You turn to the right
When I say haw</i>

19:38.520 --> 19:41.364
<i>Now gee
Yeah, yeah, little baby</i>

19:41.520 --> 19:45.684
<i>Now haw
Yeah, oh, baby</i>

19:45.840 --> 19:48.764
<i>Oh, baby, pony baby</i>

19:48.920 --> 19:54.131
<i>Do it, baby
Oh, baby, oh, baby</i>

19:54.280 --> 19:56.123
<i>Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety</i>

19:56.280 --> 20:02.162
<i>Gonna see little Suzie
Who lives next door</i>

20:02.320 --> 20:05.210
<i>She's doin' the pony</i>

20:05.360 --> 20:08.250
<i>She's takin' the floor</i>

20:09.080 --> 20:11.526
<i>So get with it
Don't quit it</i>

20:18.400 --> 20:20.323
All right.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.529
All right, Motormouth,
just three couples left.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.404
Tammy,
bring on the applause meter.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.690
Is it going to be
couple number one?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.522
Or is it couple number two?

20:39.360 --> 20:42.603
Or shall it be couple
number three?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.163
All right.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.607
I think we have a winner.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.649
And that winner is...

20:58.800 --> 21:02.964
I love them tender,
Tracy and Fender.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.485
All right.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.966
Tracy Turnblad and Fender.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.406
Tracy Turnblad, you are the
queen of the hop tonight.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.406
We hold auditions for the Council
tomorrow. Come down, strut your stuff.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.562
Oh, Corny, do you really think
I'm good enough?

21:21.720 --> 21:22.801
What do you think, Kids?

21:22.960 --> 21:24.803
Yeah!

21:26.880 --> 21:30.043
I hear you. Thanks for coming down,
Tracy. We'll see you tomorrow.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.522
Now, Motormouth, I think it's time
we slowed things down a little...

21:33.680 --> 21:34.966
with Mr. Gene Pitney.

21:35.120 --> 21:39.045
You can't hide your face
in this godforsaken place.

21:39.200 --> 21:43.569
Here in your own city,
there's a town without pity, heh.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.484
Gene Pitney,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:58.160 --> 22:04.281
<i>When you're young and so and love
As we</i>

22:04.440 --> 22:10.243
<i>And bewildered by the world we see</i>

22:10.400 --> 22:16.601
<i>Why do people hurt us so
Only those in love would know</i>

22:16.760 --> 22:22.563
<i>What a town without pity can do</i>

22:23.760 --> 22:25.569
Whore.

22:37.200 --> 22:43.606
<i>How can we keep love alive
How can anything survive</i>

22:43.760 --> 22:47.560
<i>When these little minds
tear you in two</i>

22:49.400 --> 22:53.724
<i>What a town without pity can do</i>

22:55.360 --> 22:58.364
<i>No, it isn't very pretty</i>

22:58.560 --> 23:05.842
<i>What a town without pity can do</i>

23:21.200 --> 23:24.090
<i>Hey, diddily da
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

23:24.240 --> 23:26.004
<i>Come on and make a line</i>

23:26.160 --> 23:28.686
<i>Continental, continental</i>

23:28.880 --> 23:33.886
<i>Hey, diddily dee
Oh, yeah, you're looking fine</i>

23:34.040 --> 23:36.566
<i>Continental, continental</i>

23:36.720 --> 23:40.566
<i>Come on
Let's go</i>

23:40.720 --> 23:44.566
<i>It's continental time
Continental, continental</i>

23:44.720 --> 23:47.530
<i>Hey, diddily doo
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

23:47.680 --> 23:52.368
<i>This dance is all brand new
Continental, continental</i>

23:52.520 --> 23:57.447
<i>Hey, diddily doo
Aha, it's such a ball to do</i>

23:57.600 --> 23:59.568
<i>Continental, continental</i>

24:01.000 --> 24:02.764
Thank you, girls.

24:02.960 --> 24:07.409
And now it's time to move on to a
little something we call the spotlight.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.965
Okay. First girl, Miss Pingleton?

24:17.800 --> 24:19.723
Uh, I'm just a little nervous.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.968
This is show business, young lady.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.122
If you think you're
nervous now, ha.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.328
Wait till you're on the air.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.966
Okay, first question?

24:30.560 --> 24:34.087
Are you now, or have
you ever gone steady?

24:34.320 --> 24:37.529
Well, I'm not going with anybody now,
but I'd love to date a Council Member.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.489
- Pfft. She wishes.
- Yeah, right.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.041
Come on.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.282
Exactly how many
sweaters do you have?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.209
Gee, I never counted.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.010
I guess about five.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.646
Five?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.521
Next.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.171
Nadine Carver,
Eastern High School.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.369
Are you aware Negro Day is the
last Thursday of every month?

25:01.560 --> 25:04.211
Yes, I've been on it a few times.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.280
I feel the show should be
integrated every day.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.008
Can you relate
to Lesley Gore's music?

25:13.480 --> 25:16.211
Look, she ain't no James Brown...

25:16.360 --> 25:20.445
but I can dance to
Lawrence Welk if I have to.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.568
Lawrence Welk?

25:22.720 --> 25:24.131
Thank you, Nadine.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.324
Tracy Turnblad.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.443
Would you do a pimple cream
commercial on camera...

25:36.680 --> 25:38.409
if Corny asked you to?

25:38.560 --> 25:39.891
I'd be proud to.

25:40.280 --> 25:44.171
Luckily, I've never been cursed
with acne like others.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.121
But I realize the devastating
effect of skin blemishes...

25:47.280 --> 25:48.964
on the social life of teenagers.

25:50.360 --> 25:55.924
Would you ever, heh, swim in
an integrated swimming pool, heh?

25:56.080 --> 25:57.127
Oh, my God.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.806
- I certainly would, Iggy.
- Heh.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.325
I'm a modern kind of girl.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.130
I'm all for integration.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.567
Ugh, aren't you a little fat
for the show?

26:05.720 --> 26:07.006
That's enough, Amber.

26:07.520 --> 26:11.605
I would imagine that many home viewers
are also pleasantly plump or chunky.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.525
Oh, come on. The show's
not filmed in CinemaScope, heh.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.841
You're out of line, Amber.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.571
- Ow.
- Corny, Tammy, can't you see?

26:18.760 --> 26:21.491
- This girl's a trash can.
- That's five demerit points.

26:21.680 --> 26:24.763
You're suspended from the show today.
Pack your things. Go home.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.251
Oh, my God.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.883
- I was supposed to lead ladies' choice.
- I'm sure we can find a replacement.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.126
- Yes, Corny.
- Please, wait outside.

26:35.320 --> 26:39.086
The Council will now meet in secret,
debate your personality flaws...

26:39.280 --> 26:42.045
and come to a final decision.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.004
Miss Edna!

26:47.160 --> 26:49.447
Miss Edna!

26:49.600 --> 26:51.568
Penny Pingleton,
you'll wake the dead.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.006
Tracy's not home yet.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.925
Plus your mother called
and she's on the warpath.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.684
I know, Miss Edna.
Can I come in?

26:57.880 --> 26:59.803
Oh, there's something
you have gotta see.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.803
Well, yeah, come on up...

27:01.960 --> 27:05.328
but I've got ironing
and Wilbur's working.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.926
Mr. Turnblad!

27:13.720 --> 27:16.451
It's not war with Cuba, is it?

27:16.640 --> 27:19.041
- Or more Negro problems?
- No, you'll see.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.323
Did poor Debbie Reynolds
have a nervous breakdown?

27:22.480 --> 27:23.686
This better be good.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.162
Broad daylight and I'm sitting
in front of a TV.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.527
I've seen <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>,
thank you.

27:29.680 --> 27:34.049
- Just watch.
- I just lost a $2.69 Silly Putty sale.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.283
- This better be worth it.
- Wait, you'll see. Just watch.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.845
<i>- What's your name?
- I'm Ruby.</i>

27:39.000 --> 27:40.445
<i>- And you?
- Dee Dee.</i>

27:40.600 --> 27:42.409
<i>- What about you?
- I'm Lucille.</i>

27:42.560 --> 27:44.324
<i>Where will you
be appearing tonight?</i>

27:44.480 --> 27:45.845
<i>We'll be at the Royal Theater.</i>

27:46.000 --> 27:49.322
<i>- At Motormouth Maybelle
- All soul review.</i>

27:49.560 --> 27:51.164
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

27:51.320 --> 27:53.527
<i>a big hand for Baltimore's
own Trinklettes.</i>

27:53.680 --> 27:55.444
I closed up shop for this?

27:55.600 --> 27:56.965
Just wait.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.645
<i>Let's keep the music playing...</i>

27:58.800 --> 28:00.882
<i>and the hits a-turning
with Mr. Gene Chandler...</i>

28:01.040 --> 28:04.010
<i>because the Duke of Earl
loves to cha-cha.</i>

28:06.280 --> 28:07.691
There, there. Look.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.205
It's Tracy.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.842
Oh, my God.
She's all peroxided up.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.485
I'll be damned. Tracy's on TV.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.130
With a triple process, yet.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.443
But Tracy was accepted
on the Corny Collins Council.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.400
Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad,
your daughter's a star.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.602
<i>And you, you are my girl</i>

28:30.760 --> 28:34.810
<i>And no one can hurt you, oh, no</i>

28:34.960 --> 28:37.247
See? She's already
getting close-ups.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.169
Does she get paid for this?

28:39.720 --> 28:43.042
- Big as a house.
- I think she looks pretty, Edna, heh.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.808
Hello.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.447
Uh, yes, I'm watching her now.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.281
You are? Well, thank you, heh.

28:59.440 --> 29:02.284
Yes. Good bye.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.482
That was Hilda
from up Conklin Street.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.250
She's going to send a telegram.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.284
Oh, God, there she is.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.569
<i>Nothing can stop me, now</i>

29:24.720 --> 29:29.169
<i>'Cause I'm the Duke of Earl</i>

29:29.320 --> 29:32.688
<i>So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

29:39.640 --> 29:42.041
It's time to introduce someone
very special.

29:42.200 --> 29:45.204
A new Council Member making
her first appearance on the show...

29:45.360 --> 29:47.886
and we already have telegrams.
Introduce yourself.

29:48.040 --> 29:52.682
Hi, Corny. I'm Tracy Turnblad
and I go to Mervel High.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.043
Well, someone out there likes you.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.090
"Please, have the new girl
lead a ladies' choice."

30:01.280 --> 30:03.567
I was supposed to lead
the ladies' choice.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.451
<i>- Tell me, Tracy, are you going steady?
- No, I'm not.</i>

30:06.600 --> 30:08.807
<i>But there is somebody
I've got a crush on.</i>

30:08.960 --> 30:12.931
Who, I'd like to know?
She's just a child.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.448
<i>Well, let's see who
the lucky guy is.</i>

30:15.600 --> 30:18.126
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a ladies' choice.</i>

30:18.520 --> 30:20.363
Hi, Tracy. It's me, Penny.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.329
She can't hear you.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.289
She better hadn't dare.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.085
<i>If you should lose me</i>

30:37.320 --> 30:39.641
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

30:39.800 --> 30:42.167
<i>You'll lose a good thing</i>

30:46.320 --> 30:50.245
<i>If you should lose me</i>

30:51.640 --> 30:53.529
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

30:53.680 --> 30:58.004
<i>You'll lose a good thing</i>

31:02.440 --> 31:05.410
<i>You know I love you</i>

31:05.560 --> 31:09.451
<i>Do anything for you</i>

31:09.600 --> 31:15.164
Ugh, oh, God. He's violated the
oath of the friendship ring.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.481
Oh, don't cry, honey.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.402
<i>You'll lose a good thing</i>

31:30.560 --> 31:33.564
<i>I'm givin' you one more chance</i>

31:33.720 --> 31:36.291
<i>For you to do right</i>

31:37.680 --> 31:42.686
<i>If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life</i>

31:42.840 --> 31:44.649
That fat girl's no competition.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.246
White trash, plain and simple.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.847
For all we know,
that girl could be high yellow.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.961
Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'll still be
the queen of the auto show, won't I?

31:56.120 --> 31:58.441
Oh, honey.

32:05.160 --> 32:08.448
Tracy!

32:08.600 --> 32:10.602
Tracy.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.246
No, she's not here.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.687
Well, I'm sure she loves you too.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.964
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.531
This is amazing.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.809
She's so popular already.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.641
She could be one of
The June Taylor Dancers.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.930
Hello.

32:41.080 --> 32:45.961
Well, yes,
I am Tracy Turnblad's agent.

32:46.120 --> 32:48.726
Give me a pencil. Quick, quick.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.882
How may I help you?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.326
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.767
Here's Tracy.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.449
Oh, Tracy, you were wonderful.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.365
- Honey, we're real proud of you.
- We'll be there.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.681
Oh, sweetie, listen.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.730
Tomorrow, get up just a bit
closer so we can see you better.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.083
And maybe even give the Hardy
Har a little p-p-p plug, heh.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.481
Oh, Mom, Dad.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.291
Oh, Penny, my best friend.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.124
I'm so happy.

33:19.280 --> 33:25.367
Finally all of Baltimore knows,
I'm big, blond and beautiful.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.289
You're a teen leader now.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.131
And the show biz offers
are pouring in.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.329
Tonight we have an audition.
Honey, this is only the beginning.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.960
Stick with me and we'll
claw our way to the top.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.406
Oh, God.

33:37.560 --> 33:42.202
Fame, fortune, glamour.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.681
And to top it off...

33:46.200 --> 33:48.328
- ...I'm in love.
- Oh.

33:50.440 --> 33:53.887
Wow, Tracy, you're really tough.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.806
Oh, ooh, Tracy, what do
you think about this one?

34:12.960 --> 34:14.007
- I like it.
- Oh.

34:14.159 --> 34:16.367
Wilbur would kill us
if we spent that much.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.045
You look gorgeous, Bertha.
Simply exquisite.

34:19.239 --> 34:22.641
- Oh, I don't know, Pinky.
- Have an éclair.

34:22.800 --> 34:23.960
Oh.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.891
Eat up, girls. Eat up.
Big is beautiful.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.047
Tracy Turnblad.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.409
Welcome to the Hefty Hideaway house
of fashion for the ample woman.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.210
- Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky.
- Hi.

34:35.360 --> 34:39.284
Mr. Pinky, I'm Tracy's business
manager, Edna Turnblad.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.726
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet the both of you.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.009
Here, we cater to big-boned gals
like yourself who are stylish...

34:45.159 --> 34:48.721
and at the same time frustrated
by the lack of sizes in stores today.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.770
I saw you on TV.
I want you to be my model.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.366
Would, uh...?
Would she be paid for this?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.971
One free outfit a month.

34:56.199 --> 34:59.044
You start tomorrow. I hope
there's no diets in the works...

34:59.240 --> 35:02.961
because I want to design your Miss
Auto Show coronation gown myself.

35:03.680 --> 35:07.048
Could, uh, could you throw a pair of
complimentary pettipants in the deal?

35:07.200 --> 35:10.124
You drive a hard bargain,
Miss Edna, and rightfully so.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.523
Pettipants, pettigirdle,
you just let Tracy take her pick.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.247
How about a fabulous
frock just for me?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.351
Tracy has to work one
extra day for free.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.150
It's a deal.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.123
- Thank you, Mr. Pinky.
- Ha-ha-ha.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.682
I'm going to make you a star.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.446
I hope your father likes this.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.080
He'll love it. You look beautiful.
It's the new you.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.801
Oh, mom, come on. Come on.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.246
- Go in the beauty shop?
- Yes.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.243
- You haven't done that in years.
- No, ha, ha.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.846
- Come on. You deserve it.
- No, Wilbur will kill me.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.889
- Come on.
- Oh, okay.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.651
- You really think I should?
- Yes.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.968
Come on, Mom.

36:04.040 --> 36:08.443
- Mama, welcome to the '60s.
- Heh.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.888
- I'll talk to you after biology.
- See you after PE, guys.

36:14.040 --> 36:20.844
In the figure shown, line
segment AB and line segment CD...

36:21.000 --> 36:22.843
are chords of the circle.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.846
Line segment PA
and line segment PC...

36:27.800 --> 36:30.849
What is the problem, Mr. Davis?

36:31.040 --> 36:33.520
I can't see through her hair.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.250
I can't help it if he's short.

36:35.400 --> 36:40.884
Your ratted hair is preventing yet
another student's geometry education.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.641
It's feathered, not ratted.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.640
Whatever you call it,
it's a hair-don't.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.968
You've been warned repeatedly.

36:50.200 --> 36:54.171
I want you to take a little walk
down to the principal's office.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.049
Let's see what he has to say.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.250
Anyway, she was right in the car...

37:16.400 --> 37:20.724
in plain sight of
just everybody at the hop.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.251
She was nude.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.289
- No.
- That fat thing?

37:24.440 --> 37:27.011
Tracy Turnblad is a whore.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.327
Happy now?

37:31.480 --> 37:33.687
- But, Mom, I didn't do...
- Don't "but, Mom" me.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.810
- I didn't. He's lying. Ow!
- You are suspended.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.203
- What was that for?
- Give you something to whine about.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.485
Miss Turnblad?

37:56.760 --> 37:58.125
Have a seat.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.282
Yes, sir.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.566
Once again, your hairdo
is getting you in hot water.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.401
Didn't two weeks in hairdo
detention have any effect?

38:13.120 --> 38:15.726
Uh, I happen to be the
height of teen fashion.

38:15.880 --> 38:19.407
You're on a one-way ticket
to reform school.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.843
Well, I'm afraid we're just going
to have to change your homeroom.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.131
Starting today, you report
to class 10-D, room 108.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.481
Special ed?

38:29.680 --> 38:33.082
Yes, Miss Turnblad,
special education.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.248
- But that's for retards.
- Mm.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.243
And the black kids
you try to hold back.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.971
Here, you will be taught
by specialists...

38:40.120 --> 38:44.125
trained to deal with hairdo
scofflaws in high-school society.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.930
Mr. Davidson.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.168
That will be all, Miss Turnblad.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.285
The city of Baltimore
has an interesting Catholic history.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.283
It was named after Lord Baltimore.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.841
He founded the Maryland
colony for Catholics...

38:57.000 --> 39:00.846
and others who could not practice
their religion in England.

39:08.960 --> 39:12.806
Hey, don't touch my stuff.
I'll kick your ass.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.769
Take it back.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.446
Teach us how to dance, honey.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.883
Yeah, yeah. Go, go, go...

39:48.840 --> 39:50.842
Good morning, class.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.361
Good morning, Mrs. Shipley.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.805
Now let's all stand and say
the Pledge of Allegiance.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.443
I pledge allegiance to the flag...

40:09.600 --> 40:11.648
of the United States of America.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.004
And one and two and three and four.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.606
Let's warm it up.
And one and two...

40:21.760 --> 40:24.525
Come on, Amber.
Can't we just be friends?

40:25.880 --> 40:27.245
You're acting like a child.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.522
Here we go with jumping jacks.

40:29.680 --> 40:33.480
Let's go.
And one and two and three...

40:33.640 --> 40:34.846
Now, as you all know...

40:35.000 --> 40:37.924
today is special education's turn
at the dodgeball tournament.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.451
Aw!

40:42.160 --> 40:45.164
So let's get into the locker room,
put on those gym outfits...

40:45.320 --> 40:49.291
and show them that special education
is nothing to laugh about.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.161
And three and four.
Looking good.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.810
Look, it's special ed.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.127
This is special ed?

41:14.360 --> 41:16.089
Special ed in the red!

41:17.840 --> 41:21.367
All right, ladies, let's go.
Let's play dodgeball.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.006
Penny, they put me in special ed
just because of my hair.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.561
Hey, I saw you on
<i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

41:30.720 --> 41:32.927
Where'd a white girl learn
to dance like that?

41:33.080 --> 41:34.127
Just practicing.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.851
Oh, and watching Negro Day
on Corny Collins.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.407
Hey, Thunder Thighs,
this one's for you.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.400
Grow up, Amber.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.047
Mama says Negro Day
ain't nothing but segregation.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.565
- Your mama?
- Yeah.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.530
None other than Motormouth
Maybelle herself.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.563
I'm Seaweed.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.930
Hey, Penny, see the colored boy,
the cute one?

41:55.080 --> 41:57.526
His mother is Motormouth Maybelle.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.284
He's gorgeous.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.491
I'll get the fat retard.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.248
- Game over! Let's hit the showers.
- Tracy?

42:17.240 --> 42:18.765
Tracy?

42:18.920 --> 42:20.285
Did you see that?

42:20.840 --> 42:22.808
Tracy?

42:23.480 --> 42:24.766
You're all right, girl.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.731
- Are you sure she's all right?
- Yeah.

42:27.880 --> 42:29.325
She'll be okay.

42:29.520 --> 42:33.002
It's not who wins.
It's how you play the game.

42:33.760 --> 42:37.321
Tracy,
would you go steady with me?

42:38.320 --> 42:39.606
Uh-huh.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.240
<i>Come on, everybody
Clap your hands</i>

42:44.400 --> 42:46.721
<i>Now you're looking good</i>

42:46.880 --> 42:49.804
<i>I'm gonna sing my song
It won't take long</i>

42:50.000 --> 42:53.402
<i>We're gonna do the twist
And it goes like this</i>

42:53.560 --> 42:58.361
<i>Come on let's twist again
Like we did last summer</i>

42:58.520 --> 43:04.607
<i>Yeah, let's twist again
Like we did last year</i>

43:04.760 --> 43:09.641
<i>Do you remember when
Things were really hummin'?</i>

43:09.960 --> 43:16.366
<i>Yeah, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here</i>

43:16.520 --> 43:22.323
<i>Yeah, round and round
And up and down we go again</i>

43:22.480 --> 43:26.724
<i>Oh, baby let me know
You love me so</i>

43:26.880 --> 43:32.683
<i>And then twist again
Like we did last summer</i>

43:32.880 --> 43:38.649
<i>Girl, let's twist again
Like we did last year</i>

43:38.840 --> 43:43.641
<i>Come on, let's twist again
Twistin' time is here</i>

43:48.920 --> 43:53.323
Four, three, two, one.
You're on the air.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.207
Fatty, fatty, 2-by-4, can't get
through the dressing room door?

43:57.400 --> 44:01.883
Hi, I'm Mr. Pinky, owner of the
Hefty Hideaway, 3311 Eastern Avenue.

44:02.040 --> 44:05.283
Are you big-boned, got a glandular
problem, but still want glamour?

44:05.440 --> 44:08.364
Don't worry about it.
The Hefty Hideaway has got it all.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.444
This beautiful ensemble,
being modeled by our lovely Tracy...

44:11.600 --> 44:15.400
is available in sizes 12 to 26.
You heard me right.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.289
You need a girdle? We got them.

44:17.440 --> 44:20.569
Even got large-size shoes for
that continental Clementine look.

44:20.760 --> 44:21.921
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

44:22.120 --> 44:24.691
All at prices you can afford.
Big is beautiful.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.207
Hefty Hideaway, Eastern Avenue.
Come on in today.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.408
You'll be awful glad you did.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.083
- That's our little baby.
- Ugh.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.368
She's prettier than
Elizabeth Taylor.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.085
Thank you. It's, uh, a thrill
to have you as a new sponsor.

44:41.280 --> 44:45.080
And Tracy, you keep this up and you just
may be crowned Miss Auto Show 1963.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.124
<i>Remember,
tomorrow is Preteen Day...</i>

44:49.280 --> 44:51.362
<i>so bring your little brother
or little sister...</i>

44:51.520 --> 44:55.684
<i>or cousins or nieces or nephews
and let those tykes rock'n 'roll on...</i>

44:55.920 --> 44:58.526
<i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

45:00.400 --> 45:02.050
I've never been to North Avenue.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.010
Don't worry.
Seaweed gave me the directions.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.206
Oh, my God! It's Tracy!

45:12.600 --> 45:15.490
- Tracy!
- What's your name?

45:15.640 --> 45:17.802
Oh, that's so sweet.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.008
Thank you.

45:20.440 --> 45:23.171
Penny! Hurry up. Hurry up.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.443
I gotta go. Thank you. Penny!

45:31.440 --> 45:33.408
Taxi. Taxi.

45:33.560 --> 45:37.042
Come here. Quick, quick.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.401
Follow that bus.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.687
- Yeah, this is the place.
- Wow.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.281
This is great.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.048
Look at that.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.170
Never been to this part
of town before, heh.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.766
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:06.400 --> 46:10.371
There they are.
Stop the cab. Stop the cab.

46:28.400 --> 46:31.688
<i>Come on, everybody
Dig this dance I'm gonna put down</i>

46:31.840 --> 46:33.330
<i>Is it the Watusi?</i>

46:33.480 --> 46:34.925
<i>No, baby</i>

46:35.080 --> 46:38.368
<i>- Is it the twist?
- Un-un!</i>

46:38.600 --> 46:41.649
<i>- Flap your wings
- Flap your wings</i>

46:41.800 --> 46:44.849
<i>- While the music swings
- While the music swings</i>

46:45.000 --> 46:47.765
<i>- Get with the beat, now
- Get with the beat</i>

46:47.920 --> 46:49.729
<i>Ow! Lookin' real</i>

46:51.640 --> 46:54.644
<i>- Come on and work it baby
- Work, work, work</i>

46:54.800 --> 46:57.280
<i>- Come on and work it now
- Work it, work</i>

46:57.440 --> 46:59.920
Tracy Turnblad.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.163
You're my favorite dancer
on Corny Collins.

47:05.320 --> 47:08.130
I'm L'il Inez, Seaweed's sister.

47:08.280 --> 47:10.760
Well, it's nice to meet you,
L'il Inez.

47:10.920 --> 47:14.129
Uh, this is my best friend Penny.
Link you probably know from the show.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.442
Wow, you guys really came.
Hey, everybody.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.484
This is Tracy,
the baddest white dancer in town.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.284
And this is Link.

47:21.480 --> 47:22.811
This is Penny.

47:22.960 --> 47:24.724
No matter what you heard...

47:24.880 --> 47:30.569
we are gonna teach the white
children how to do the Bird.

47:30.960 --> 47:34.328
Right. Come on. Come on. Watch.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.804
<i>- Come on and work it baby
- Work, work, work</i>

47:39.000 --> 47:42.243
<i>- Come on and work it, honey
- Work, work, work</i>

47:42.400 --> 47:45.449
<i>- Do the swim
- Do the swim</i>

47:45.600 --> 47:47.409
<i>- Do the flea, now
- Do the flea</i>

47:47.600 --> 47:48.761
Hey, Miss White Lady.

47:53.320 --> 47:57.848
Hey, can you spare me a quarter,
so I can buy me a taste?

47:58.040 --> 48:00.122
Somebody, please, help me.

48:00.280 --> 48:02.044
Here, here. Take it all.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.969
- Take it. Take it all.
- Uh...

48:07.080 --> 48:09.162
Please, don't hurt me. Please.

48:11.560 --> 48:13.801
Why, thank you.
Thank you kindly.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.565
- Help.
- Ha-ha-ha!

48:18.600 --> 48:21.331
No, no, no.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.926
Oh, oh, oh!

48:24.080 --> 48:26.242
- Officer.
- Yes, ma'am? Can I help you?

48:33.240 --> 48:35.720
<i>Let's get together tonight
And play some hide and go seek</i>

48:35.880 --> 48:37.689
<i>Let's play some hide and go seek
Let's go</i>

48:37.840 --> 48:39.888
Ooh, the dirty boogie.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.929
<i>Well, I love you
Love you, love you</i>

48:42.080 --> 48:44.481
<i>Tickle, tickle
Hug me, hug me, hug me</i>

48:44.640 --> 48:47.291
<i>- You all hid?
- Yeah!</i>

48:47.480 --> 48:49.528
<i>If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat</i>

48:49.680 --> 48:51.569
<i>Bahh</i>

48:51.720 --> 48:54.326
<i>- Are you ready?
- I'm not ready</i>

48:54.480 --> 48:55.641
<i>Aw, man, let's hide this time</i>

48:57.240 --> 48:58.844
<i>I went down the road
The road was muddy</i>

48:59.000 --> 49:01.685
<i>I stubbed my toe
My toe was hurting</i>

49:01.840 --> 49:04.286
<i>- Who all hid?
- Yeah</i>

49:04.440 --> 49:06.761
<i>If you ain't hid, you better holler
Billy goat</i>

49:06.960 --> 49:09.122
<i>Bahh</i>

49:10.040 --> 49:12.327
<i>Two bars of washing powder
Two bars of soap</i>

49:12.480 --> 49:14.448
<i>Already hid, you better holler
Billy goat</i>

49:14.600 --> 49:16.762
<i>I went down the road
The road was muddy</i>

49:16.920 --> 49:19.287
<i>I stubbed my toe
My toe wasn't hurting</i>

49:19.440 --> 49:21.602
<i>Walk, don't jump
To the bottom of the well</i>

49:21.760 --> 49:25.287
<i>Swam by the devil and he
I'm not gonna say that</i>

49:25.600 --> 49:28.080
<i>- Who all hid?
- Yeah</i>

49:28.240 --> 49:30.322
<i>If you ain't hid, you better
holler Billy goat</i>

49:30.480 --> 49:32.608
<i>Bahh</i>

49:34.760 --> 49:35.921
Don't anybody come near me.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.811
I'm armed, and I'm prepared
to protect myself.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.407
Oh, God, Mother.

49:43.640 --> 49:48.168
I know you were snatched, Penny,
and I've come to save you.

49:48.360 --> 49:51.284
Oh, Papa Tuney, we got a loony.

49:51.440 --> 49:56.446
Don't you try any of your voodoo
spells on me, you native woman.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.409
We're just dancing.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.643
Mrs. Pingleton, stop acting crazy.
These are our friends.

50:01.800 --> 50:04.167
Don't act ignorant,
Tracy Turnblad.

50:04.320 --> 50:05.845
- Come on, Penny.
- Mother.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.651
Come on. Run. Run.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.689
Run for your life!

50:14.200 --> 50:17.568
Don't push, please. Don't push.
Settle down. It's hot. Please.

50:17.720 --> 50:22.123
If you'll just stay still,
you won't be so hot...

50:23.560 --> 50:25.449
You're gonna do terrific, all right?

50:25.600 --> 50:27.250
Oh, it's gonna be a lot of fun.

50:36.040 --> 50:40.090
<i>Come on come on
And do the fly with me</i>

50:41.040 --> 50:46.843
<i>Hey, come on everybody
And do the fly with me</i>

50:47.280 --> 50:52.161
<i>Well if you don't know how to do it
Just watch and see</i>

50:53.440 --> 50:55.488
<i>You've gotta shake your hands
All around</i>

50:55.640 --> 50:57.608
Right over here.

50:59.440 --> 51:05.083
<i>And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try</i>

51:05.240 --> 51:08.528
<i>All the girls and the guys</i>

51:08.680 --> 51:11.650
Tracy! Aah! Tracy!

51:12.320 --> 51:13.446
What the hell?

51:13.880 --> 51:15.530
What are they doing here?

51:15.680 --> 51:17.045
Look what she's wearing.

51:17.200 --> 51:20.010
Hurry up, but watch your step.
Hurry, but watch your step.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.321
- You all together?
- Yeah.

51:21.480 --> 51:25.246
Sorry, Preteen Day is a white-only show.
Negro Day is the end of the month.

51:25.400 --> 51:29.371
- You can come in or get out of the line.
- You're gonna turn this little girl away?

51:29.560 --> 51:31.642
I don't make the rules.
You gonna come in...?

51:31.800 --> 51:34.690
Aren't you aware of the Supreme
Court ruling on segregation?

51:34.840 --> 51:38.686
What are you talking about? I just want
you to either come in or don't come in.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.928
- I have a dream.
- You heard the man.

51:41.080 --> 51:45.165
<i>- You're holding up the line.
- Segregation never! Integration now!</i>

51:45.320 --> 51:46.731
Cut it out. Knock it off.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.486
<i>Segregation never!
Integration now!</i>

51:49.640 --> 51:51.722
Come here. Come here.
Hold them. All right.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.287
<i>- All right.
- Integration now! Segregation never!</i>

51:54.520 --> 51:57.490
Okay, you little tykes.
We got a real treat in store for you.

51:57.640 --> 51:59.563
A local group with a big hit record.

51:59.760 --> 52:02.331
Let's have a warm welcome,
come on, for the Lafayettes.

52:07.040 --> 52:10.522
- Mother.
- Go on. What are you waiting for?

52:15.600 --> 52:18.365
<i>Well, life's too short</i>

52:18.520 --> 52:19.965
<i>And you're too sweet</i>

52:21.160 --> 52:23.162
<i>Every day of your life, child</i>

52:23.960 --> 52:26.406
<i>You've got to spend with me</i>

52:27.000 --> 52:29.731
<i>Now let me tell you about Sally</i>

52:29.880 --> 52:32.281
<i>She's a-really tough</i>

52:32.680 --> 52:35.411
<i>And girl you know about Emmy</i>

52:35.920 --> 52:39.811
There's some trouble outside. A little
black girl who wants to be on the show.

52:39.960 --> 52:43.487
- Well, let her in, for God sakes.
- The station management says no.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.684
She's with agitators. I'm afraid
demonstration's in the works.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.241
Okay,
I'll be there as soon as I can.

52:50.280 --> 52:51.327
Where are you going?

52:51.520 --> 52:54.126
- Wait, I gotta go.
- You're a teen helper. You can't go.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.886
You can't change the world's
problems in one day.

52:57.040 --> 53:02.490
<i>A-no no, a-no no</i>

53:03.680 --> 53:11.680
<i>I, I keep a-tellin' you</i>

53:13.320 --> 53:15.687
<i>Aah, I</i>

53:16.600 --> 53:18.329
<i>I said I told a-you baby</i>

53:18.480 --> 53:21.927
<i>Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!</i>

53:22.080 --> 53:25.243
- Please, sit down and stop this, please.
- Hey, you.

53:25.400 --> 53:27.528
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

53:27.720 --> 53:31.406
- Is your daughter mulatto?
- Why, you...

53:31.600 --> 53:36.481
- Look at this.
- How dare you call my daughter mulatto?

53:36.640 --> 53:38.369
Tracy. Tracy, come back here.

53:38.560 --> 53:41.211
<i>Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!</i>

53:41.400 --> 53:44.085
<i>Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!</i>

53:44.280 --> 53:45.327
<i>Two, four, six...!</i>

53:45.480 --> 53:46.925
<i>A-hey-hey</i>

53:48.760 --> 53:50.649
<i>A-hey-hey</i>

53:51.360 --> 53:53.283
<i>A-hey-hey</i>

54:08.440 --> 54:10.681
Now, kids, we're gonna get
real lovey-dovey.

54:10.840 --> 54:13.207
One of your favorite records
and one of mine too.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.966
Lesley Gore, sing your heart out.

54:25.600 --> 54:29.241
Can I, uh, have this dance?

54:29.400 --> 54:31.289
Sure.

54:34.080 --> 54:37.402
What difference does it make,
Mr. Hodgepile? One little black girl?

54:37.560 --> 54:39.403
Who are you, the NAACP?

54:39.560 --> 54:43.007
But it's an easy way
to integrate without trouble.

54:43.160 --> 54:44.571
Absolutely not.

54:44.720 --> 54:47.724
Baltimore is not ready
for integrated dancing.

54:47.880 --> 54:50.121
<i>And don't tell me what to say</i>

54:50.280 --> 54:54.080
<i>And please, when I go out with you</i>

54:54.240 --> 54:57.562
<i>Don't put me on display</i>

54:57.720 --> 55:02.521
<i>'Cause you don't own me</i>

55:02.680 --> 55:04.250
<i>Don't try to change me</i>

55:04.440 --> 55:06.568
Ew!

55:06.720 --> 55:10.088
<i>Two, four, six, eight!
TV's got to integrate!</i>

55:10.280 --> 55:11.964
Aah! That's the fuzz!

55:13.640 --> 55:15.051
That's it for today, kids.

55:15.200 --> 55:18.124
See you tomorrow at 3:00,
live at Tilted Acres.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.000
<i>I'm blue</i>

55:59.560 --> 56:02.723
<i>I wanna tell all you people</i>

56:02.920 --> 56:08.484
<i>I dropped a penny in the well
Hopin' you would come back soon</i>

56:08.640 --> 56:11.803
<i>I couldn't believe what I heard</i>

56:11.960 --> 56:17.251
<i>A fortune teller told me
My love with you was through</i>

56:17.400 --> 56:20.563
<i>I hope her reading was wrong</i>

56:20.720 --> 56:24.805
<i>I hope she was wrong
'Cause you been gone too long</i>

56:24.960 --> 56:26.928
<i>- Come home
- Hey!</i>

57:04.800 --> 57:09.522
Black Baltimore, your mother
is ready to show her might...

57:09.680 --> 57:12.081
and fight, fight, fight.

57:12.280 --> 57:13.441
Yeah!

57:17.040 --> 57:20.487
All right, now. After school,
you know where to go.

57:20.640 --> 57:22.563
Tilted Acres, for the show.

57:22.720 --> 57:27.169
Segregation? No, no, no!

57:29.400 --> 57:32.370
No, no, no!

57:32.560 --> 57:34.164
<i>No, no, no!</i>

57:34.360 --> 57:37.284
<i>No, no, no!</i>

57:41.680 --> 57:45.969
All right, now. I want to
introduce you to my main man.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.690
I'm his biggest fan.

57:47.840 --> 57:49.604
All the way from Louisiana...

57:49.760 --> 57:52.127
just to see me,
the big mamma jamma.

57:52.320 --> 57:56.041
Now, I want a ball in this hall,
because he's a real doll.

57:56.240 --> 57:59.562
Talking about Toussaint McCall.

58:18.480 --> 58:21.290
<i>I moved your picture</i>

58:23.440 --> 58:25.602
<i>From my walls</i>

58:28.640 --> 58:31.007
<i>And I replaced them</i>

58:33.080 --> 58:36.402
<i>Both large and small</i>

58:38.120 --> 58:40.691
<i>And each new day</i>

58:42.720 --> 58:46.281
<i>Finds me so blue</i>

58:48.440 --> 58:50.522
<i>Nothing</i>

58:52.480 --> 58:55.689
<i>Takes the place of you</i>

58:56.480 --> 59:00.485
<i>And oh, my darling</i>

59:02.320 --> 59:04.891
<i>I'm so blue</i>

59:07.400 --> 59:09.721
<i>Because nothing</i>

59:09.880 --> 59:12.281
<i>Oh, nothing</i>

59:12.480 --> 59:14.209
<i>Takes the place of you</i>

59:17.560 --> 59:19.801
<i>I</i>

59:22.120 --> 59:24.930
<i>I write this letter</i>

59:27.320 --> 59:29.084
<i>It's raining</i>

59:30.080 --> 59:33.209
<i>On my window pane</i>

59:37.640 --> 59:40.530
<i>And</i>

59:41.360 --> 59:44.284
<i>I feel the need of you</i>

59:46.200 --> 59:48.851
<i>Because without you</i>

59:50.080 --> 59:54.085
<i>Nothing seems the same</i>

59:56.040 --> 59:58.725
<i>So I'll wait</i>

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.884
<i>Until you're home</i>

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.564
<i>Again I love you</i>

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.162
<i>But I'm all alone</i>

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.248
<i>And oh, my darling</i>

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.887
Oh, Link, this is so romantic.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.289
I wish...

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.165
I wish I was dark-skinned.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.168
Oh, Tracy.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.605
Our souls are black,
even though our skin is white.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.441
Oh, Seaweed.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.523
Oh, Seaweed,
will integration ever come?

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.890
Oh, Penny, my little white lily.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.847
We're outcast from both
societies, black, white.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.729
Our love is taboo.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.924
Oh, go to second.
Go to second.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.165
Oh, yes.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.081
Seaweed, look.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.769
Tracy. Tracy Turnblad,
It's your mommy.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.083
- Oh, my God, it's my mother.
- She's gonna kill us.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.727
- There they are. Tracy! Tracy!
- I'm gonna die.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.360
Where are they?
Don't run, Tracy.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.251
You'll fall. You have heels on.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.004
You'll fall, honey.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.008
Hello, hello! Oh, thank God.
Can we please come in for a little while?

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.491
- Open up.
- Please.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.642
- Oh, come on.
- Open up.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.365
- Let us in.
- Can we come in?

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.045
- Please?
- Come on, guys.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.929
Come on. Come on.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.810
Like, hi, cats.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.321
Sit down.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.008
- You got the fuzz chasing you?
- No, we were...

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.085
- Wow, you cats are real beatniks.
- Just like New York.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.843
Day-o, day-o

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.527
<i>Daylight's a-comin'
And he wanna go home</i>

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.128
- You two checkerboard chicks?
- What?

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.409
You know, black and white,
salt and pepper.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.891
Well, yes, I'm a
checkerboard chick, I guess.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.242
Whoa! Whoa!

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.482
Phew!

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.964
- I'm an integrationist.
- Yeah.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.327
We shall overcome someday.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.085
Not with that hair, you won't.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.370
You look like a hairhopper to me.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.445
I mean,
your hair is really uncool.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:51.128
How do you get your hair
so straight and so flat?

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.850
With an iron, man.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.166
I play my bongos, listen to Odetta,
and then I iron my hair. Dig?

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.527
I think we'd better get going now.
The coast looks clear.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.770
Let's do some reefer. We'll get high
and I'll iron the chicks' hair.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.048
Reefer? Oh.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.802
Drugs?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.331
Locoweed.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.724
When I'm high, I am Odetta.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.531
Let's get naked and smoke.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.165
Cool.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.368
Don't breathe it in.
You'll be addicted.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.522
Later, sister, later.
Much later.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.684
<i>I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness</i>

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.451
<i>Starving, hysterical, naked
Dragging themselves...</i>

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.323
<i>Angelheaded hipsters burning for
The ancient heavenly connection</i>

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.801
<i>To the starry dynamo
In the machinery of night</i>

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.686
<i>Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed
And sat up smoking in the...</i>

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.120
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Dad?

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.602
Don't "hi, Dad" me.
The whole world saw you on the news.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.121
Penny, this is Dr. Frederickson.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.841
He's a psychiatrist, and he's
going to make you all better.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.685
Feeling depressed, Penny?
Want to talk about it?

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.050
Think of all the white boys in school
and how much you'd like to date one.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.089
Be a good little girl
and slip this on.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.850
Shock treatments are the answer.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.810
- Come here, Penny.
- What are you doing?

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.327
Good girl. Good girl.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.767
- I love you, Seaweed!
- Shut up!

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.924
- Get her in the car.
- It'll be all right. Get her, doc, quick.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.327
Prudy,
this is totally unnecessary.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.450
Come on, honey. Time to go home.
You can see Link tomorrow.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.286
We've been worried sick about you.
This neighborhood's no place for a star.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.442
Get in that car before
someone sees you.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.449
<i>Tilted acres is not fair!</i>

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.608
<i>Racist people everywhere!</i>

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:44.760
<i>Tilted acres is not fair!
Racist people everywhere!</i>

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.126
- Get out of here.
- Go back where you belong.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.487
Well, personally,
I have nothing against them.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.803
It's merely a matter of economics.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.207
Tilted Acres
will never be integrated.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.409
- Segregation today.
- Segregation tomorrow.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.483
Segregation forever.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.610
Hey.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.328
One black face gets on camera,
this show's off the air.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.801
The kids don't care
if blacks dance on the show.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.485
This is ripping the city apart.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.450
Motormouth Maybelle is
out there, and she's our friend.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.729
We've done hops together for years.
The kids love her.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.922
<i>The Corny Collins Show</i>
remains white.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.491
Or you're all fired.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.405
Good afternoon, Baltimore, and welcome
to <i>The Corny Collins Show.</i>

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.244
Yes, we are live from Tilted Acres.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.721
Hop in the car,
bring the whole family, come out.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.685
Right now I want to introduce
to you the top contenders...

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.522
in the Miss Auto Show contest,
Amber Von Tussle and Tracy Turnblad.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.407
I understand you're both going to
introduce a new dance in the show today.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.570
Yes, I am, Corny.
It's called the Limbo Rock.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.327
And I bet some people will
find it quite difficult.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.887
Here it is, the Limbo Rock.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.606
<i>Every limbo boy and girl</i>

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.366
<i>All around the limbo world</i>

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.602
<i>Gonna do the limbo rock</i>

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.851
<i>All around the limbo clock</i>

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.526
<i>Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick</i>

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.331
<i>Jack, go under limbo stick</i>

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.086
<i>All around the limbo clock</i>

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.925
<i>Hey, let's do the limbo rock</i>

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.361
Good afternoon, Penny.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.010
Feeling better?

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.561
Getting in touch with your anger?

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.087
Go, Tracy, go!

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.683
<i>Limbo ankle, limbo knee
Bend back like a limbo tree</i>

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.491
<i>Jack, be limber, Jack, be quick</i>

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.211
<i>Jack, go under limbo stick</i>

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.041
I watch that tramp
and I'm embarrassed to be white.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.931
You know, Edna,
I've been reading about these kids.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.562
Maybe Tracy could be
some sort of campus leader.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.246
Wilbur, it's the times.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.164
They're a-changing.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.926
Something's blowing in the wind.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.924
Fetch me my diet pills,
would you, hon?

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.451
<i>Get yourself a limbo girl</i>

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.924
Go back to Africa where you came from.
Your kind's not wanted here.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.286
Baltimore, you saw it here first.
The Limbo Rock.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:42.010
Thank you very much, Amber.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.731
- I'm a winner, Corny.
- Well, Amber, you won the dance...

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.770
but let's check the election
results to see how you're doing.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.211
We have an upset.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:55.728
For the first time, Tracy Turnblad
is number one with a bullet.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.805
What do you have to say
for yourself, Tracy?

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.567
If elected, I plan to
represent all of Baltimore.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.161
Today I'd like to introduce
a brand-new dance...

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.765
and dedicate it to some
of my special friends...

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.367
who, because of small-minded people,
can't be here with me today.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.050
My dance is called the Waddle.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.167
That girl's got
roaches in her hair.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.250
Roaches?

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:19.845
My little Tracy's a clean teen.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.684
There's no bugs on our baby.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.121
I'm not kidding.
I just saw one.

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:26.089
Amber,
you're such a comedian, heh.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.448
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tracy Turnblad and the Waddle.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.405
You all make me sick.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.290
- Tammy.
- What is going on here?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.807
- Look, we had nothing to do with it.
- It isn't our fault.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.726
Seaweed, come on.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.365
Seaweed.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.730
Tracy, just keep dancing.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.882
Move it around here.
What, are you crazy?

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.690
Come on. Move out.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.082
That's why I would like
to humbly state...

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.528
Daddy. Mommy. Daddy.
Mommy. Daddy.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.330
- There's a riot going on.
- A riot?

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.608
- A race riot.
- A race...?

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.683
- Yo, I'm talking to you.
- Look, I have no...

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.240
Everybody just stay calm.
Stay calm...

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.091
You leave my boyfriend alone,
you witch.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.806
- You scum!
- Stay back. Stay back.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.487
Police brutality.
Police brutality.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.324
- Negroes.
- Aah!

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.403
- Black boys.
- Aah!

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:15.281
Police brutality!
Police brutality!

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.728
Tracy!

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.011
Tracy!

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.882
Link! Link!

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.443
- Police brutality!
- Tracy!

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.844
Hey, let her go! Tracy!

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.050
Tracy!

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.570
Tracy!

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.606

- Penny. How are you?

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.649
Why are you here?
What happened to your head?

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.683
Uh, it happened at Tilted Acres.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.884
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.

Amber will be so proud of us.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.326
We're going to go down in the history
books for this one, Velma.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.320
<i>Tracy's parents had an emotional
appeal for their daughter.</i>

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.291
<i>Tracy, honey,
we know you are innocent.</i>

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.845
It's Miss Edna.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.886
- Has she always been that big?
<i>- We joined the NAACP.</i>

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.044
<i>And we will fight in every way
possible to get you released...</i>

- in Harlem.
- Ha, ha.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.804
- What was that?
- Ah, just the TV.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.611
I heard somebody laugh.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.930
Oh, my God! There are
colored people in my house!

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.082
I'm gonna make a citizen's arrest.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.685
Stop! Stop!

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.407
- Paddy, stop them.
- What the...?

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.249
Come on, Penny.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.323
Penny Pingleton,
I'm calling the cops.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.644
You are no longer my daughter.
You are punished even after you die.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.563
It's a real pleasure to be here
today in the city of Baltimore...

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.200
at this wonderful auto show.
Thank you very much.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.410
I have my aide here with the scissors
and we're gonna take this opportunity...

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.121
to open the show here
in the city of Baltimore.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.970
- There we are.
- Thank you, governor.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.166
Wonderful to see you again.
How are you doing?

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.890
How do you do?
So nice meeting you.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.923
You've got some
spinach on your tie.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.648
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!</i>

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.043
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!</i>

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.727
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!</i>

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:47.880
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never! Integration now!</i>

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.526
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!
Segregation never!</i>

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.970
Now, just remember, if Amber loses,
she walks off the set...

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.444
and then you throw the bomb.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.328
Who the hell is Tracy Turnblad?

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.323
She's an upper lower-class teenager...

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.960
who was arrested
in yesterday's demonstration...

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.168
and is currently being held
at Montrose.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.529
- She is a hairhopper.
- A what?

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.129
- Free Tracy Turnblad!
- Jesus Christ.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.850
More integration pickets.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.089
This is a political hot potato
and I wasn't even warned.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.810
This came out of nowhere.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.008
We had no idea of her
grassroots support.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.006
You keep the goddamn cops away
before this makes the national news.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:40.606
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!
Free Tracy Turnblad!</i>

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.842
Governor, governor.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.890
We must have some answers
for our vast television audience.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.328
Voters are demanding answers
right here at the governor's mansion.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.929
This demonstration's gonna turn nasty.
We've got to get answers.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.560
- Hey, no police. No police.
- Good evening, governor.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.882
- May I speak with you?
- How are you, dear?

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.044
What are you doing? What is this?
What's with the handcuffs?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.126
Oh.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.806
Hi, honey. I'm... I'm home.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.601
Well, Baltimore, today's the big day.
We're here live at the new armory...

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.843
for the grand opening
of the 1963 Auto Show.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.846
And who will be the dancing princess
from our council to be crowned queen?

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.604
We'll know right after this.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.929
No cops. No cameras.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.085
We're gonna work this thing out
ourselves, aren't we?

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.402
Madame, you do have
the key to these?

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.928
We'll talk about the key
after you release Tracy.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.129
Stinky, stinky, stombo...

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.411
The moment of truth
has arrived, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.046
- You, the audience, made your decision.
- Excuse me.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.807
And here to announce the
results we have Mr. Arvin Hodgepile...

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:58.531
president of WZZT studios,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.249
Thank you. Thank you.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.489
We have a difficult situation
with the votes tabulation.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.881
The results were quite close.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.487
<i>Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!</i>

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:18.528
<i>Tracy! Tracy! Tracy!</i>

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.366
Technically, the winner is
Miss Tracy Turnblad.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.965
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.805
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Quiet.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.482
Shut up, or we're
going off the air.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.290
Now listen carefully.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.729
Since Miss Turnblad is in reform school,
the judges have found her ineligible.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.450
I would like to announce
on behalf of WZZT...

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.811
the winner of the Miss Auto Show
1963, Amber Von Tussle.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.644
Let's talk this over.
We can discuss this.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.724
Oh, what...? Oh, wow.
Let's talk it over.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.287
- Leave him alone.
- We can talk... I'll call.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.049
Well, Amber, like it or not,
you're officially Miss Auto Show 1963.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.845
Any words for your opponent who
many feel was the more popular winner?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.686
I'd like to lead a dance
and dedicate it to that loser.

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.607
Tracy Turnblad, I hope you're watching,
because this one's for you.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.004
It's a brand-new dance, one that
I'm sure you'll know how to do.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.531
It's called the Roach.

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.043
<i>Too bad you can't be
here to do it.</i>

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.522
I'm the winner!
Leave me alone!

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.808
Amber Von Tussle and the Roach.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.727
<i>There's a dance
They're callin' the Roach</i>

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.282
<i>It's buggin' all the kids
From coast to coast</i>

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:45.641
<i>Well now, form a big line
Do the Roach</i>

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:50.601
<i>Everybody, now
Squish, squash</i>

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.649
<i>Kill that roach</i>

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.642
<i>Well, there's a roach
Upon my floor</i>

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.007
For Christ's sakes,
pardon Tracy Turnblad.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.730
- All right!
- Whoo!

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.686
<i>Free Tracy Turnblad!</i>

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.450
<i>Squish, squash
Kill that roach</i>

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.244
Tracy?
What are you doing here?

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.521
I got something for you.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.130
Amber.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.804
Wait. Hold on.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.327
Baltimore, you are seeing
history being made today.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:51.162
White and black together
for the first time on local TV.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.927
- I hate you, Tracy Turnblad.
- <i>The Corny Collins Show</i> is integrated!

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.366
Yes, all right!

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.404
Amber, we're going home now.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.324
No, Mommy, no!

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.801
Stop. Get away from me.
Get away. Come on.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.611
I'm a married man with a family.
Don't hurt me, please.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.082
Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.368
I love you, Baltimore.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:01.086
I don't know about you,
but I feel like dancing.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.850
I've got the Bug.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.164
<i>Everybody's jumpin'
Movin' around</i>

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:20.840
<i>Nobody's standin' still
Keepin' their ground</i>

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.209
<i>You can't tell what'll happen
When they pass it around</i>

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.169
<i>It's the bug</i>

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.645
<i>You got it, you got it
You're all on your own</i>

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.327
<i>Somehow it seems better
When you do it alone</i>

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.723
- What are you doing? Ow!
- Give me that.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.809
You little... Ugh.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.648
<i>Well, come on, baby
Let's do the Bug</i>

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.361
<i>Mm, come on, baby
And give me a hug</i>

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.086
<i>Come on, baby
My turn's long due</i>

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.210
<i>I wanna Bug
Bug a hole in my shoe</i>

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.523
<i>Well, real bugs bug me
No matter what size</i>

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.125
Come down. Come down.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.368
- Itching powder.
- Itching powder?

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.522
Oh, oh, oh!

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.923
- Let's dance!
- Yeah!
