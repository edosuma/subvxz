LIN28A, so called
"fountain of youth" gene.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.643
They're manipulating
the expression levels

00:06.720 --> 00:08.324
of LIN28A in both of these subjects

00:08.400 --> 00:09.686
WOMAN: This is Aisha and this is...

00:09.760 --> 00:12.240
The human experiment that P.T.
had chained up in his basement.

00:12.320 --> 00:15.324
He was our first LIN28A subject.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.721
He showed remarkable healing.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.926
<i>KIRA: I cut myself.</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.963
I wanted to see how fast I could heal.

00:21.040 --> 00:23.122
You've isolated
the mutation in Kira, haven't you?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.925
Her healing ability is a self-regulating
mutation of the gene.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.729
Which does not cause cancer.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.849
Unlike Aisha, whose cancer
you've manipulated, not cured.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.809
We have to know if the trait
is heritable.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.245
<i>COSXMA". You're gonna harvest her eggs?</i>

00:34.320 --> 00:36.721
- How many surrogates?
-1500 to start.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.326
However they're planning
to exploit Kira, it's happening soon.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.449
I RA: <i>Imprisoning Virginia C 0a d y,
the woman who ran CA 5 TOR.</i>

00:42.520 --> 00:43.885
She's a dangerous liability.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.647
But do you think she's dead?
What if he finds out?

00:46.720 --> 00:47.801
COSIMA: You're dying, P.T...

00:47.880 --> 00:50.531
All this suffering just so that
you can extend your life?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.162
You're not even 170.
That's all smoke.

00:55.720 --> 00:56.721
Let me out!

00:58.080 --> 00:59.650
HEY, GUYS, I'm Krystal.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.042
Before we begin this week's segment,

01:08.120 --> 01:11.681
we just wanna give a big shout out

-Oh, my God. That's all over the world.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.485
Yeah, and we love getting comments from
you guys who can't really speak English.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.449
- It's so adorable.
-It is.

01:23.560 --> 01:27.485
Your supportjust gives us
strength and courage

01:27.560 --> 01:30.689
to keep exposing the lies
of big cosmetics.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.525
- Anyway, so, speaking of celebrating...
-(GIGGLES)

01:33.600 --> 01:36.251
Today, we are going to show you
how to do this incredible

01:36.320 --> 01:38.607
hot, sexy, effortless party look.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.241
The great thing about this
is that you literally need

01:42.320 --> 01:43.606
-zero product.
-What?

01:43.680 --> 01:47.651
So, what you need are these
cute, little, colourful bendy straws.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.881
I put them in last night.

01:48.960 --> 01:53.170
So, we will start by taking out all
of the cute, little straws.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.451
And you'll be amazed how the curls,
like, totally spring from your head.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.247
What?

02:01.680 --> 02:02.681
What?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.488
(BOTH SHRIEKING)

02:11.920 --> 02:14.241
I know, I know.
I know it's so hard to watch.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.045
(STAMMERS) We're still not sure
what we're seeing here, Krystal.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.360
I know, right? Like...

02:18.440 --> 02:20.920
Not even a top scalp specialist
knew what was going on there.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.571
But I told Brie
I have white-hot friends so...

02:24.680 --> 02:27.001
- Thank you for helping me.
-Yeah.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.081
Yeah, thank you.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.640
Sure, with what, exactly?

02:31.640 --> 02:32.721
She's been poisoned.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.691
By big cosmetics.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.803
What about...
What about that is confusing?

03:17.080 --> 03:20.527
- Sarah?
-Dyad's here for Kira.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.044
Good morning.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.922
Mum, she's not well.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.962
How are you, Kira?

03:31.040 --> 03:33.361
- I barfed this morning.
-So I hear.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.928
She doesn't have a fever.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.211
You don't want to miss
a visit with Rachel do you?

03:43.280 --> 03:45.169
You're too sick, babe.
You're gonna stay here.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.969
No, Mum, I wanna go.

You're wearing a bell?
What are you, his livestock now?

04:14.040 --> 04:15.041
No.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.290
It's my own punishment.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.362
Yanis and Salvador are both dead
because of me.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.608
No, no, no, no.
That's all Westmoreland.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.485
You've gotta get over this place, Mud.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.807
Mud, Mud, come on, break the spell.
Talk to me.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.370
Talk to me. Where are you from?

04:28.440 --> 04:30.283
Where are you from? (SIGHS)

04:34.000 --> 04:36.401
I'm just a girl from Seattle, okay?

04:37.560 --> 04:38.561
Nobody cares about me.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.850
Then I came here
and saw wondrous things.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.169
It's not wondrous, Mud.
It's all a lie.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.444
He's not who he says he is.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.045
I'm not letting you out.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.761
Look, you know what he's doing
to my niece, who is eight years old?

04:54.360 --> 04:56.522
He's gonna fertilise
over 1,000 of her eggs

04:56.600 --> 04:58.284
and implant them in surrogates.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.051
Experimental children.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.247
Like Yanis.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.731
Come on.
Let me out.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.723
Let me out so I can warn my family.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.804
- No.
-No, no, no, Mud!

05:15.080 --> 05:18.448
My niece! Think of my niece!
Please!

05:18.880 --> 05:21.770
- He's gone.
-You did so well, babe.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.650
You really did, love.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.801
I'm sorry, but you should
be done being sick.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.804
Syrup of ipecac
usually does three good pukes.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.570
So, what the hell, S? We did
all of this on account of Delphine?

05:33.640 --> 05:36.450
She travelled here from
the island at great personal risk.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.131
To warn us to keep Kira away from Dyad.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.925
And she and Cosima have identified

05:41.000 --> 05:43.002
whatever gene they're looking for
in Kira?

05:43.080 --> 05:45.321
MRS S: Westmoreland's
fountain of youth gene.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.401
LIN28A.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.762
Maybe that's the same gene
that makes my mouse's skin grow back.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.529
Delphine is gonna rendezvous
with Adele and Felix in Geneva.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.407
They've sent new dirt
on the Neo money trail.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.122
Rachel has been busy.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.763
Neolution-infiltrated companies have
made huge acquisitions in healthcare

06:06.840 --> 06:08.126
and also some...

06:08.280 --> 06:09.441
Some kind of odd sectors,

06:09.520 --> 06:11.887
but maybe Delphine
can give us some context with that.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.402
Okay, I see how Delphine
can be involved in this,

06:14.480 --> 06:17.211
but is she the source who got you Coady?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.090
I have more than one source.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.409
And you know when to leave
well enough alone.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.003
- Made you tea.

but we may have a lead.</i>

06:30.920 --> 06:32.126
Are you near a laptop?

06:33.280 --> 06:35.362
<i>So, our blog is super popular.</i>

06:35.440 --> 06:39.001
<i>We exposed inconvenient truths
about big cosmetics.</i>

06:39.080 --> 06:41.401
So, it's retaliation obviously.

06:41.960 --> 06:42.961
Aha!

06:43.680 --> 06:45.091
Thanks, Krystal.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.481
Uh, Art, what are they on about?

06:47.560 --> 06:50.530
She's been poisoned, okay?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.888
<i>Probably by those Swedish Neolutionists.</i>

06:53.240 --> 06:56.289
<i>Like that Russian whose hair fell out
when they put a nuclear bomb in his tea.</i>

'Cause she is so rude,</i>

06:59.920 --> 07:01.285

07:01.360 --> 07:02.885
Okay, she's an operative,
like you, Krystal.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.247
Okay? So right now we just
need to stick to the facts.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.607
Now, you said that they were targeting
a cosmetics exec that you met?

07:07.680 --> 07:09.842
Oh, yeah. Leonard Sipp.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.724
Len is like...

07:14.160 --> 07:17.050
(CHUCKLES) He's like an artist
in the industry.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.326
We met at a trade show.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.084
Girl, he's totally into you.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.050
He's only the CEO
of Blue Zone Cosmetics.

<i>It's an amazing company.
So ethical.</i>

07:26.160 --> 07:28.640

cultivating him as a source.</i>

07:32.840 --> 07:36.686
Anyway, he invited us to this
really amazing party at his penthouse.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.967
But then, the day that
they poisoned Brie's hair,

07:39.040 --> 07:40.451
he totally stopped calling me.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.922
He didn't return my calls or my texts.
He just, like, ghosted me.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.889
They got to him for sure.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.965
Just grabbing this document
that confirms that Len Sipp sold

07:57.040 --> 08:00.123
Blue Zone Cosmetics
to a Dyad subsidiary.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.526

come down with the flu.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.807
I verify it as, "She emptied the
contents of her stomach onto my shoes."

08:19.960 --> 08:22.645
Mr Westmoreland wants to begin
her hormone treatments.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.690
As she is ill, I thought it best
to let her recover at home.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.011
Not arouse suspicion
by dragging her out of there.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.203
We'll let her rest for now.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.049
With Yanis gone, perhaps you'll focus
on what's important.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.131
Kira's mutation.

08:44.880 --> 08:49.044
For that, we need Cosima. Kira will be
much easier with her on side.

you've gone mad.

If a meddling student.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.521
And you were brilliant.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.369
But it was 1962, and you were a woman.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.967
And what I couldn't get with brains,
I bought.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.883
By fortune and fiction.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.769
That's how the patriarchy works.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.361
All to push your crazed ideals.

Been a long time since the three of us
were in this room together.

You bought me
from that mercenary, Ferdinand.

drooling on myself for months.

She is a maniac.

segments of the population

10:35.800 --> 10:37.723
to genetically advance the human race.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.370
Well, it sure would speed things up.

Thirty yea rs ago, I separated CASTOR
from LEDA at Susan's request.

Now, I have you both here...
I realise that was a mistake.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.326
Cosmetics. Why would Neolution
be expanding into cosmetics?

11:10.400 --> 11:14.200
Well, because it's
a $700 billion industry, for one.

- More research dollars than cancer.
-Piss off.

into something big again?

11:24.920 --> 11:26.285
I do not know how the girl does it.

11:26.880 --> 11:27.881
Seriously, you don't?

11:30.600 --> 11:34.525
Wonder if Krystal...
Could make Len Sipp talk?

11:35.480 --> 11:36.720
Oh, chicken...

11:39.360 --> 11:40.361
Is that a good idea?

11:40.440 --> 11:41.566
That is not a good idea.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.003
That was my initial thought too, Arthur.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.287
But we did buy ourselves
some time with Kira.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.601
There's a window here
to figure out the bigger picture.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.765
It's a good way to connect the dots.

<i>If they're using LIN28A,
this guy would know.</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:56.167
just get Krystal to set me up
with a meeting with Sipp.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.681
<i>Okay-</i>

11:58.960 --> 11:59.961
I'll try.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.966
We need to move quickly, Arthur.
So set it up for tonight.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.601
- KIRA: Mum?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.162
I have a new codename for the island.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.041
Wonderland.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.161
(CHUCKLES)

12:14.280 --> 12:16.806
And if I have to, I'll hustle Rachel.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.484
No, no, no.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.245
You've done your part today.

-(IMITATING KRYSTAL) Now it's my turn.
-(CHUCKLES)

12:23.920 --> 12:26.685

-I love Krystal.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.649
I love you.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.442
You've got it wrong.
Len is Mr Vegan King of the industry.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.965
He would never sell his company to Dyad.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.804
Okay, that's all
I wanna talk to him about.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.201
Well, I should talk to him.
He's my source.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.011
You and that Australian girl are gonna,
like, mess the whole thing up.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.208
Okay, look, Krystal, I think
the best thing for you to do

12:43.280 --> 12:44.884
is to stay here and support Brie.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.685
Scott is gonna run some tests
and believe me, you're in good hands.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.761
(SCOTT BLOWS NOSE)

12:50.080 --> 12:52.003
Okay, look, just call Len, all right?

12:52.080 --> 12:53.525
And tell him that you wanna
meet him at your place.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.041
I'll take care of the rest.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.601
Fine, give me your phone.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.366
We never met, but you know me.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.722
I knew the previous occupant down here.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.401
Your sisters too.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.681
Sarah and Helena.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.086
You're Virginia Coady?

13:19.760 --> 13:23.128
Just re-familiarising
myself with the facilities.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.161
This lab's an old friend.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.931
- Are you taking inventory?
-Don't worry.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.602
You're not deadstock yet.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.521
Still Susan's beautiful baseline,
aren't you?

13:38.280 --> 13:39.361
I never accepted that.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.886
I don't get it.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.441
Your family...

13:44.520 --> 13:48.241
Kira's mutation,
Helena's fetal stem cells...

13:48.320 --> 13:49.651
They will be exploited.

13:50.720 --> 13:56.090
If you shifted your thinking one step...
You could be part of it.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.485
There's a pet project
I could use you on.

13:59.560 --> 14:03.451
They've developed the most ingenious
delivery systems while I've been gone.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.848
Frankly, you're all too insane.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.804
IRA: Virginia Coady is here?

14:12.880 --> 14:14.564
Yes, she escaped.

14:14.880 --> 14:15.927
And he brought her here.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.762
Her influence is the last thing we need.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.800
He's losing his grip.
He's going to destroy everything.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.483
- Did she ask about me?
-Ira, she is a monster.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.927
Yes, but she created CASTOR.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.446
As a weapon.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.724
I raised you as a human being.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.325
I would still like to learn
about myself.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.367
(SOFTLY) I'm sorry.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.650
She's evil.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.487
I locked her up
to keep her away from my science.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.049
And P.T. has resurrected her?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.203
I should've killed her
when I had the chance.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.125
Susan. (BREATHING HEAVILY)
You're not a murderer.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.922
No, I'm everything but.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.283
And that may have to change.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.726
Well, then...

15:10.000 --> 15:11.968
Let me try and get close to her.

15:15.960 --> 15:20.568
Okay, I need to take a blood sample
to test for any toxins in your system.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.085
Yeah, you should take off
your sweater, Brie.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.722
What?
So you don't get any blood on it.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.489
- Right.
-(CHUCKLES) Okay.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.801

-Obviously.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.320
(GIGGLES)

15:37.680 --> 15:39.170
- Dr Scott.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.366
Are you really a doctor?

15:40.960 --> 15:44.362
- No, but I dropped out of a doctorate.
-Still pretty good.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.244
My hair is super fragile

15:46.320 --> 15:49.085
and I was wondering if you could
help me take off my sweater.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.207
Uh, yeah.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.281
- Okay?
-Yeah.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.842
- Great.
-Maybe I'll just...

vaguely-

16:54.640 --> 16:57.610
Well, you were only four
when Susan separated you.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.442
It was tough for everyone.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.367
How you screamed, leaving your brothers.

17:04.079 --> 17:06.082
Are there any of my brothers left?

17:10.440 --> 17:11.566

What is this all for?

17:30.320 --> 17:33.403
Susan certainly remade you
in her image, didn't she?

17:35.640 --> 17:37.768
Some singers are dancers.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.490
All dancers are slim.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.963
So, there are no slim singers.

17:43.880 --> 17:44.881
True or false?

17:47.280 --> 17:48.645
Have you shown any symptoms?

17:49.680 --> 17:50.681
No.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.007
Did Susan tell you?

17:53.800 --> 17:54.961
I'm close to a cure.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.164
How... How does it go?

36:38.520 --> 36:39.851
"To her fair works

36:40.720 --> 36:45.089
<i>"did nature link this human soul
that through me ran.</i>

36:48.560 --> 36:51.404
<i>"If this belief from heaven be sent,</i>

36:51.960 --> 36:55.328

37:11.000 --> 37:13.765
Hello, Virginia, what's happening?

37:14.360 --> 37:16.840
She was trying to kill you.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.961
No.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.363
I was trying to save us all.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.051
(ENGINE STARTS)

37:32.880 --> 37:33.881
- Cosima?
-Yeah.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.486
It's too far from the mainland,
and I can't even swim.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.006
Hey, hey, this is something
you don't know about me.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.287
I grew up on boats.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.530
And we've got a compass
and we've got charts,

37:45.600 --> 37:47.204
and we've got extra gas.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.040
It's really calm tonight, see?

37:50.560 --> 37:51.766
Can you take care of that?

37:51.920 --> 37:52.967
Thank you.

37:59.560 --> 38:00.766
I don't think they're coming.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.801
Susan?

38:17.640 --> 38:18.721
Susan!

38:20.080 --> 38:21.923
Susan, we have to go now.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.441
MAN: Burn everything!

39:29.000 --> 39:30.206
Revival is a lie!

39:31.400 --> 39:32.447
Get the children out!

39:33.960 --> 39:35.405
Burn every building!

39:59.280 --> 40:00.406
We are getting her back.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.970
S, we're not storming the gate.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.161
What are you doing here?

40:04.640 --> 40:06.051
Oh, wow, Alison.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.045
Unlock his cuffs and leave us.

how important you are?</i>
