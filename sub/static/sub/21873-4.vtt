WEBVTT

00:12.041 --> 00:13.583
Lee and I have
some issues to discuss.

00:13.834 --> 00:14.709
Open or closed?

00:14.709 --> 00:15.959
-Open.
-Closed.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.125
He said to do closed.

00:18.041 --> 00:20.583
You all are probably wondering
why I'm sitting with you.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.792
Lee Russell is an asshole.

00:22.792 --> 00:23.959
-(LAUGHING)
-No shit.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.083
He's got me substitute
teaching history class.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.208
STUDENT:
You even go to college?

00:27.208 --> 00:28.583
(SCOFFS) Yes.
I went to college.

00:28.583 --> 00:29.750
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
What were your SAT scores?

00:30.041 --> 00:32.250
(MOCKING) I think my SAT scores
are none of your business.

00:32.875 --> 00:35.500
The teachers definitely hate you
and mock you at every turn.

00:35.917 --> 00:37.083
NEIL GAMBY: King Ding-a-Ling?

00:37.083 --> 00:38.417
MS. ABBOTT:
So, I made it my wall paper.

00:38.667 --> 00:39.792
(LAUGHING)

00:40.083 --> 00:41.417
Woo!

00:41.750 --> 00:43.333
LEE RUSSELL: I am the Principal.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.166
Uh, I was supposed
to be Principal too, so...

00:45.166 --> 00:47.375
Yes... But, then you got shot.

00:47.625 --> 00:50.333
You were broken
and I brought you back.

00:56.583 --> 00:59.250
Boy:
Most mischievous
foul sin...

00:59.250 --> 01:00.625
What a life is this,

01:00.625 --> 01:02.875
that your poor friends
must woo your company?

01:02.875 --> 01:04.583
Girl:
A fool, a fool!

01:04.583 --> 01:06.500
I met a fool in the forest,

01:06.500 --> 01:09.458
a motley fool,
in a miserable world!

01:09.458 --> 01:11.709
(dialogue continues
indistinctly)

01:11.709 --> 01:13.125
All right. Listen,
listen, listen, listen!

01:13.125 --> 01:14.792
My good friend
Joni Mitchell once said,

01:14.792 --> 01:16.792
"Laughing and crying..."
And shut up, Maggie!

01:16.792 --> 01:18.583
"...is the same release."

01:18.583 --> 01:21.291
(students chattering)

01:21.291 --> 01:23.417
Think, think, think,
think, think, think.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.375
Gamby:
Seychelles!

01:29.375 --> 01:30.959
Seychelles!

01:32.417 --> 01:34.500
Where are you, big boy?

01:34.500 --> 01:37.166
Seychelles!

01:37.166 --> 01:40.375
(singsongy)
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:43.917 --> 01:46.333
Seychelles.

01:52.417 --> 01:55.458
Seychelles.
I see you in that red hat!

01:55.458 --> 01:56.667
Get out here, right now!

01:56.667 --> 01:59.083
Team-building is mandatory,
Russell says so.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.625
Have a heart. I have all this
work to do, you know that.

02:01.625 --> 02:03.500
Seychelles--
You don't understand!

02:03.500 --> 02:06.750
You're not an artist!
Get the fuck out!

02:06.750 --> 02:10.000
-(men shouting orders)
-(clamoring)

02:10.000 --> 02:11.667
Woman:
Move it, ladies!

02:11.667 --> 02:13.083
(clamoring continues)

02:13.083 --> 02:16.000
If we are passionate,
there is nothing
we cannot accomplish.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.125
Power is speed and force.
Let's go!

02:19.125 --> 02:22.458
These guys are working
the teachers like Hebrew slaves.

02:22.458 --> 02:26.041
SweatDogs are the best
team-building company
in the world.

02:26.041 --> 02:29.166
They've even done it
for Japanese corporations.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.208
(grunts, sobs)

02:31.208 --> 02:33.000
Look at Seychelles's ass.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.542
Flustered, sweating,
and looking like a bitch.

02:35.542 --> 02:37.041
What are you doing?
Don't look at me.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.917
Get up. We don't fall over.
Don't look at me.

02:38.917 --> 02:40.208
On your feet, sir!

02:40.208 --> 02:41.750
Seychelles:
I can't do it.
It's too heavy.

02:41.750 --> 02:44.083
It's too heavy?
Well, we've identified
the weak one.

02:44.083 --> 02:46.000
The man
in the infinity scarf.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.667
That's how you keep
people in line, Gamby.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.041
You push them
to the limits.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.000
That's enough.
He's trying his best.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.709
Break them down to nothing.

02:52.709 --> 02:55.333
I think you should get back
to doing what you were doing.
Don't touch me.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.000
And rebuild them
into whatever you want.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.875
Pretty diabolical there, boss.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.792
It's good to be the king.

03:02.792 --> 03:04.250
(screams)

03:04.250 --> 03:06.750
(theme music playing)

03:16.125 --> 03:19.750
What I just witnessed:
the most obnoxious,

03:19.750 --> 03:22.583
arrogant, out-of-shape
group of teachers

03:22.583 --> 03:24.375
that I have ever seen
in my life.

03:24.375 --> 03:25.709
And we work
with the Special Olympics!

03:25.709 --> 03:27.834
Well, why do you think
I fuckin' called you?

03:27.834 --> 03:29.750
Huh? You got
your fuckin' berets.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.208
You got your tank tops.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.917
Isn't it to whip people
into shape?

03:32.917 --> 03:35.333
Woman:
Don't worry, don't worry.
We like to implement

03:35.333 --> 03:38.208
involuntary reeducation
of basic beliefs and values

03:38.208 --> 03:40.667
to adjust to your
institution's philosophy.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.208
Hmm. So brainwashing.
It's not brainwashing.

03:43.208 --> 03:45.333
We call it...
Think-change.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.166
Shawn came up with that term.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.792
I used to be fat as fuck,

03:50.792 --> 03:53.834
but I had to change
my lifestyle and my mindset

03:53.834 --> 03:55.500
to get jacked and pumped.

03:56.542 --> 03:57.834
Think-change.

03:57.834 --> 04:00.792
You, my friend,
are fuckin' cool!
You're damn right.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.792
(knock on door)
What, Janice?

04:02.792 --> 04:04.458
Can't you see I'm talking
to these SweatDogs?

04:04.458 --> 04:06.750
Oh, I'm very sorry to...

04:06.750 --> 04:08.458
interrupt.
Then why are you
interrupting?

04:08.458 --> 04:09.959
Your wife called,

04:09.959 --> 04:12.667
and, um, it's urgent.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.125
So, what's
the emergency, Russell?

04:18.125 --> 04:19.834
My father passed away.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.458
Aw, shit.

04:24.625 --> 04:28.166
I'm sorry, Russell.
Were you guys close?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.500
No.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.208
He was a Navy captain,
my daddy.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.083
A fuckin' man's man.

04:34.083 --> 04:38.291
(sighs) He showered
my two older sisters
with all the affection.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.917
They grew up to be tomboys,

04:41.917 --> 04:44.166
interested in sports and cars.

04:45.917 --> 04:48.667
He was always
more proud of them
than he ever was of me.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.542
That's tough.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.875
That's real tough.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.333
I know how it is.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.166
Really?
Your father was an asshole
who looked down on you too?

04:59.291 --> 05:01.375
I mean...
not really.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.875
Actually, he supported me
in all my endeavors,

05:03.875 --> 05:05.875
was there for me pretty much
every step of the way.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.375
What the fuck?

05:07.375 --> 05:10.208
You have no fuckin' idea
what I'm going through, Gamby!

05:10.208 --> 05:12.250
Well, I still
really, really pity you.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.333
Is there anything I can do?

05:14.333 --> 05:15.542
Yes.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.709
I need you to run Jackson
while I'm gone.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.875
For a day.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.667
You think you can do that
without fuckin' it up?

05:23.667 --> 05:25.250
Trust me, okay?
I can handle anything.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.375
Can you handle these lazy,
fuckin' teachers?
Yeah.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.458
Don't let them get out
of the team-building
workshops either.

05:29.458 --> 05:33.041
I paid these SweatDogs
good money to beat them
into submission.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.625
If they participate,
you write them up.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.500
Mandatory attendance.
Got it. Easy.
And a fine.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.083
And a fine.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.667
Look at that.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.375
Come tomorrow,

05:42.375 --> 05:45.959
you will be principal
of North Jackson high school.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.750
For a day.

05:53.959 --> 05:56.125
It'll be nice to see
your sisters again.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.166
We haven't seen them in ages.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.583
Their boys must be
all grown up by now.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.250
All four of their kids
together look like

06:02.250 --> 06:04.417
a retarded
Hitler youth group.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.333
Oh, fuck, no!

06:06.333 --> 06:08.375
Christine,
I have a white stain

06:08.375 --> 06:10.166
on my special
black funeral suit!

06:10.166 --> 06:12.250
It's so small,
you can hardly notice it.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.792
My sisters notice
everything.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.917
Lynn will say that this
looks like dried-up cum,

06:15.917 --> 06:18.125
and Lacey will say
that it is dried-up cum.

06:18.125 --> 06:21.291
You know how my sisters are
towards me, Christine!

06:21.291 --> 06:23.291
Yeah, but
everything's closed.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.834
Nothing's open now.
But...

06:25.834 --> 06:28.250
Nobody's going to be
noticing your suit.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.959
You're there to celebrate
your father's life.

06:34.625 --> 06:37.291
It doesn't look
like dried-up cum.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.166
Okay.

06:41.166 --> 06:45.458
♪ ♪

06:58.458 --> 07:02.709
♪ ♪

07:11.166 --> 07:12.500
God damn it.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.625
Both:
...with liberty
and justice for all.

07:14.625 --> 07:15.959
Unbelievable.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.667
Good morning,
boss for the day.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.041
Principal Gamby.

07:19.041 --> 07:21.166
What do you two
think you are doing?
We just raised the flag,

07:21.166 --> 07:22.709
getting the doors
open for business.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.041
You don't think I would have
wanted to raise the flag, Nash?

07:25.041 --> 07:27.542
Russell usually does it,
but we didn't know
that you were--

07:27.542 --> 07:29.709
(babbles)
Listen to what you're
saying, okay, Nash.

07:29.709 --> 07:32.000
Russell usually does it
because he's the principal.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.458
What am I today?
I'm the principal, Nash.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.083
Of course
I want to raise the flag!

07:36.083 --> 07:38.375
And why are you wearing
a hat when you're pledging
allegiance, Nash?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.625
The one fuckin' time I've ever
seen you with a hat,

07:40.625 --> 07:42.250
and it's when
you're raising the flag.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.333
You guys suck beans
at being patriots.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.083
Mr. Gamby, you have
a nine o'clock with
Harold in maintenance,

07:47.083 --> 07:49.333
and then you have
a 9:30 phone call
with the district,

07:49.333 --> 07:51.667
and then after lunch,
you have a meeting
with student government.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.041
Oh, and, um,
here's the checklist

07:53.041 --> 07:55.458
of all the teachers doing
new curriculum proposals.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.125
You're about to give me
a fuckin' panic attack,

07:57.125 --> 07:58.709
and I'm just starting
to get situated, okay.

07:58.709 --> 07:59.959
Don't be fuckin'
with my head!

07:59.959 --> 08:01.166
I'm sorry, um...

08:01.166 --> 08:03.417
You have about seven minutes
until morning announcements.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.792
I have to do that?

08:04.792 --> 08:06.208
It'll be fun.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.875
Okay. This is
a teleprompter.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.333
Can you read okay?

08:12.333 --> 08:14.709
These are the words
that I'm to say?
Yes, it is.

08:14.709 --> 08:16.458
Okay. Easy fine. Cinch.
Okay.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.041
I'm gonna give you a countdown
and we're gonna start. Three.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.667
Two.
Two, one.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.083
One.
Three, two, one,
to do what?

08:22.083 --> 08:24.083
To do what?
To do the thing? I'm ready.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.583
Girl: Go!
Gamby: Fine. Shut up.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.917
Oh shit, Mr. Gamby on TV.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.583
Hey! Good afternoon, ladies.

08:29.583 --> 08:30.750
Girl: Tigers.
Tigers.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.917
I'm Principal Namby...
(laughter)

08:33.917 --> 08:37.375
Robotics Club is canceling
their monthly meetings
next Thursday,

08:37.375 --> 08:39.417
so, no reason
to go to the meetings,

08:39.417 --> 08:41.917
'cause no one who does robots
is going to be there.

08:41.917 --> 08:45.542
Uh, today, is Miranda Clarke
and Ricky Leache's birthday.

08:45.542 --> 08:47.792
It's a special time
to have a birthday,

08:47.792 --> 08:49.667
to be able to celebrate
with your friends.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.041
Mr. Gamby looks like
he's having a stroke.

08:51.041 --> 08:53.375
Uh, faculty is reminded
that today after school,

08:53.375 --> 08:55.583
team-building with
the SweatDogs will continue.

08:55.583 --> 08:56.875
Attendance is mandatory.

08:56.875 --> 08:58.750
And in the final words
of every...

08:58.750 --> 09:00.583
the stuff for the
morning announcements,

09:00.583 --> 09:02.083
is that there is no fear

09:02.083 --> 09:03.959
of anything slipping
through the cracks

09:03.959 --> 09:07.291
while Lee Russell is gone,
because I am here,

09:07.291 --> 09:09.250
the principal that everyone
knows that I can be,

09:09.250 --> 09:14.291
so that the school
is in the best hands
that can ever to be in.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.792
Okay, anyway.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.333
Do I have to say that's it?
Cut. Will someone say cut?

09:19.333 --> 09:20.917
I'm sitting here
fuckin' sweating my face off.

09:20.917 --> 09:22.625
I don't know if this is going
to the fuckin'...

09:22.625 --> 09:25.500
(school bell chimes)

09:25.500 --> 09:27.458
(voices murmuring)

09:29.208 --> 09:30.709
Russell:
Okay, Momma.

09:30.709 --> 09:34.041
Oh, let's go sit down
in your favorite chair.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.917
You look so good!

09:35.917 --> 09:39.166
I used to rock you
in this chair.

09:39.166 --> 09:40.625
(speaking Korean)

09:40.625 --> 09:42.458
Not-not now, Mi-Cha.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.667
Mi-Cha, please!

09:43.667 --> 09:45.500
Just go to the
snack table, please.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.917
Okay? Just...
There's some... Please.

09:47.917 --> 09:51.792
If you need anything, Momma,
please, just let me know.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.583
I'm just so glad you came, son.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.250
I didn't think you would.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.250
Momma, why would
you think that?

09:58.250 --> 10:00.083
Christine:
Look who I found.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.500
Lee!

10:01.500 --> 10:02.959
Wow.

10:02.959 --> 10:05.125
You actually came.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.458
We didn't think
you'd make it. Hi.

10:07.458 --> 10:10.250
I'm not so sure why everybody
thought that I wasn't coming?

10:10.250 --> 10:11.583
That's just crazy.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.834
Well, you never called,
or texted, or...

10:13.834 --> 10:16.333
e-mailed, so what did
you expect us to think?

10:16.333 --> 10:18.125
Well, I would expect
you both to think

10:18.125 --> 10:20.667
that I would show up
to my own daddy's funeral.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.709
Stop trying to make
me look bad, okay?
Lee Russell.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.417
Don't you start up
again, not here.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.542
Shep! Tripp!
Come and say hi to your uncle.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.500
Yeah, Arliss, Wyatt,
get in here.
Come on.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.875
Get in here.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.917
Hey, Uncle Lee.
You came after all.

10:32.917 --> 10:36.125
After Lynn and I
finish speaking
at Dad's ceremony,

10:36.125 --> 10:38.834
they are going to play
a tribute on their guitars.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.000
Been practicing for weeks.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.875
Oh my God, you look like
a Christian rock band.

10:41.875 --> 10:45.166
So, everybody has a part
in the ceremony, except for me?

10:45.166 --> 10:48.500
We didn't think you cared.
We assumed you wouldn't want to.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.375
Momma, would you like
a nice cold cup of iced tea?

10:51.375 --> 10:54.834
Yeah, I'll get you some,
I'll get you some.
I got it. Lee, I got it.

10:54.834 --> 10:56.208
Stop-- Aah!

10:56.208 --> 10:58.583
Fine. Whatever.
I'm sorry, Momma.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.834
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Momma.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.333
Boys! Get--

11:02.333 --> 11:03.542
(sighs)

11:04.750 --> 11:07.709
Can we speak to you
for a moment, Lee?
No.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.041
Why are you acting
like a little bitch?

11:11.041 --> 11:13.875
Look, we've got enough
going on here with the funeral

11:13.875 --> 11:15.625
and moving Momma
into a nursing home.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.000
Momma's moving
into a nursing home?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.291
Well, that's news to me.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.875
Of course it's news to you.
You're never around!

11:21.875 --> 11:23.959
Why do you think
we packed up
all of Dad's stuff?

11:23.959 --> 11:26.542
Yeah, I'm claiming
his China, his comfy chair,

11:26.542 --> 11:28.083
and his old Navy
magazines.
That's right.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.917
And I've got his DVDs
and his rifle.

11:29.917 --> 11:32.041
Well, did you think that maybe
I would want some of his

11:32.041 --> 11:33.834
magazines or his rifles?

11:33.834 --> 11:37.041
Just 'cause you two
French-kissed his asshole
his whole fuckin' life--

11:37.041 --> 11:40.375
Excuse me?
Excuse me! I get some stuff too.
And you know what?

11:40.375 --> 11:43.125
I'm going to start right here--
No, you're not
gonna start anything.

11:43.125 --> 11:44.417
Lee! Stop it!

11:44.417 --> 11:46.041
That is mine!
I fuckin' claimed it!

11:46.041 --> 11:47.917
You're so funny.
You're so funny.
You should back off.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.041
I don't even want that.
It's so stupid.
You know what's funny?

11:50.041 --> 11:54.917
Is your fuckin' face,
your fuckin' little pig face.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.333
See this? It's mine.
Whatever.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.000
Fine.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.291
His model airplane.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.625
Oh, no you don't.
Hands off!

12:05.625 --> 12:06.917
Those are for our kids.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.625
Don't you think your kids
are a little bit old

12:08.625 --> 12:10.333
to be playing
with model airplanes?

12:10.333 --> 12:11.875
You don't even have kids.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.959
That's 'cause
he's shooting blanks.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.250
Uh-oh, Lynn.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.959
Her blood is boiling.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.542
Oh yeah, she's gonna
throw a hissy fit.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.208
What, are you getting
all... all red?

12:20.208 --> 12:21.625
Are you getting red?
Oh that's so funny,

12:21.625 --> 12:23.041
you calling me
"she" again.
Look at that.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.083
Why don't you get some
new fuckin' material, all right?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.250
Lee.
Jesus, what?

12:27.250 --> 12:30.458
What is that stain
on your pants, Lee?
Oh yeah, that looks like cum.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.667
I don't have--
No, I didn't cum on myself.
Did you cum on yourself again?

12:33.667 --> 12:35.959
No, no, no, no!
No, no!

12:35.959 --> 12:37.917
No, no, no!

12:37.917 --> 12:41.625
No, no, no! No!
(shrieking laughter)

12:41.625 --> 12:42.959
Lynn:
Dirty little boy!

12:42.959 --> 12:45.667
Please-- No! No.

12:45.667 --> 12:48.250
No, Lacey, Lacey.
Please, no!

12:48.250 --> 12:50.000
Open the door.
Open the door, please?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.125
You know what?

12:51.125 --> 12:53.792
Fuck you! Fuck you!

12:55.125 --> 12:57.500
When you say venison,
it has to have

12:57.500 --> 13:00.667
all the sadness
of the exile in that word.

13:00.667 --> 13:04.709
Sh-Come! Shall we go
kill us some venison?

13:06.041 --> 13:07.500
Seychelles:
Oh, shit.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.250
Mr. Geal Namby.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.917
Your video announcements
would have been the highlight
of my morning,

13:11.917 --> 13:14.417
but you choked,
as we actors say.

13:14.417 --> 13:17.792
Where are the curriculum
proposals that Russell
asked for yesterday?

13:17.792 --> 13:21.417
Excuse me if the proposals
are a little bit tardy.

13:21.417 --> 13:24.208
Russell has been
running us ragged,
stressing everybody out.

13:24.208 --> 13:25.375
Oh, give me a break.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.083
You're a grown man
who prances around in tights.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.583
What the hell
do you have to do?
Gamby.

13:29.583 --> 13:33.208
You're not gonna make us
stay after school
with the SweatDogs?

13:33.208 --> 13:34.750
They're not human.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.583
They threatened
to waterboard me yesterday.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.917
You're going,
Seychelles, okay?

13:38.917 --> 13:41.208
So, he dreams it up,
you execute it,

13:41.208 --> 13:43.250
like a little puppet man
coming to fuck us.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.458
You better watch your tone.

13:44.458 --> 13:45.750
I'm the principal,
do you hear me?

13:45.750 --> 13:47.500
(giggling)
You're not the principal!

13:47.500 --> 13:50.125
You're just a flimsy cardboard
cutout of a principal.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.583
You're just
a two-bit thespian.

13:51.583 --> 13:52.709
Stand-in.
(scoffs)

13:52.709 --> 13:54.291
Queen for a day.
Seychelles, that's enough!

13:54.291 --> 13:56.917
Get back in there
and teach these children
how to play make-pretend.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.917
Just like you're
making-pretend
to be principal.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.959
Fuck you.
(mouths words)
Fuck you.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.375
(scoffs)

14:04.458 --> 14:07.000
(loud clattering)

14:07.000 --> 14:09.125
Adolescent behavior.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.583
(tuning guitars)

14:11.583 --> 14:13.083
What is the matter?

14:13.083 --> 14:15.125
Why are you so upset?

14:15.125 --> 14:16.875
They're putting you
in a home, Momma,

14:16.875 --> 14:19.375
a terrible, awful,
nursing home.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.750
It's my idea.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.458
I don't want to live in this
big old house all by myself.

14:24.458 --> 14:27.083
I want to be with people
my own age.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.917
They have
brainwashed you, Momma.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.625
It breaks my heart to think
of you in a place like that

14:31.625 --> 14:34.041
where the orderlies
molest all the seniors.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.125
Stop.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.792
Lynn and Lacey are
rotten human beings, Momma.

14:38.792 --> 14:41.375
I wish that they had died
instead of Daddy.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.667
Don't you go cursing
your sisters like that.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.333
I know you don't get along
with them and I know why,

14:47.333 --> 14:50.208
'cause you think
Daddy liked them better.

14:50.208 --> 14:53.125
Well, maybe,
I do, yes, but...

14:53.125 --> 14:55.667
we will never know if
that's true or not, Momma.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.792
No, it's true.
He loved them more.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.792
Your sisters are mean.
Yeah.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.333
They tease you,
they strip off your clothes.

15:03.333 --> 15:06.166
Do you think I'm blind?
I know that.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.291
But they were never
being sneaky like you.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.792
You told lies,
lies that stung.

15:12.792 --> 15:15.959
Daddy didn't like that,
even if they caused it.

15:15.959 --> 15:19.208
Make your daddy proud
of you for once.

15:21.166 --> 15:24.166
You're right, Momma.

15:24.166 --> 15:26.667
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:26.667 --> 15:27.834
Oh!

15:29.834 --> 15:32.667
I love you.
I love you.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.875
Back it up.

15:39.875 --> 15:42.166
Hey, Mr. Gamby, those teachers
hate them SweatDogs

15:42.166 --> 15:44.458
more than they hate your ass.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.834
Oh, here we go.
Oh, shit.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.625
Gamby, this is
getting ridiculous.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.333
The SweatDogs
want us to record

15:49.333 --> 15:51.083
when we throw out
our lunches now.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.583
And they're harassing us
about our diets.
Shh. SweatDogs are coming.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.417
What? Ridiculous.
Ms. Snodgrass.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.709
Mrs. Deets.
Lunchtime is over.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.625
There is no time
for stop and chat.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.709
Is this normal behavior,
Mr. Gamby.

16:01.709 --> 16:04.291
The stop and chats?
Uh, I mean...

16:04.291 --> 16:06.458
Yeah, the teachers
usually do chitchat

16:06.458 --> 16:09.834
after lunch.
That is your fault.
I blame you.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.959
You are enabling
this behavior.

16:11.959 --> 16:13.375
Look, I know about
being a leader too.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.291
I mean, it's like,
the main part of my job,

16:15.291 --> 16:17.709
like being productive,
and... and being leader.

16:17.709 --> 16:21.166
We do the same thing.
Incorrect, Mr. Gamby.

16:21.166 --> 16:22.709
You don't do what we do.

16:22.709 --> 16:26.041
Because if you did what we do,
we wouldn't be here.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.709
Do you see what I'm saying?

16:27.709 --> 16:30.458
Yeah. But I'm not sure
if you're seeing what
I'm saying, which is,

16:30.458 --> 16:33.333
I also specialize
in leadership too.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.375
Show me. Show us.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.625
Be the leader
that you say you are.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.375
Get these underlings
back to work. I want to see.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.834
(mutters)
Okay, yeah, well...

16:43.834 --> 16:46.500
Women...
Come, come, women, now.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.083
Enough with
the small talk, okay?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.667
It's time to get back
to your places.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.250
That was pathetic.
Bark at them.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.583
Go on! I said,
go on now.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.125
Get to class,
the both of you.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.458
You got--
Bark at them. Bark at them!

16:58.458 --> 16:59.792
Go--
Bark at them!

16:59.792 --> 17:02.625
God damn it!
Get back to your fuckin'
classes right now! Go!

17:02.625 --> 17:05.709
(stomps foot)
Shoo!
Get on, varmints!

17:05.709 --> 17:07.083
(hisses)

17:09.333 --> 17:11.250
It's not about
being nice, ladies.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.083
It's about being leadership.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.583
I like it!
See, I told you guys.

17:14.583 --> 17:15.583
I can do this.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.875
Fantastic!
Yeah!

17:16.875 --> 17:18.500
Are you going to stand here
like an asshole

17:18.500 --> 17:21.166
or you going to get back
to work yourself?

17:21.166 --> 17:24.959
Yeah, of course
I'm gonna get back to work.
Come on. Don't trip.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.709
See you,
SweatDogs.

17:26.709 --> 17:30.792
(guitars playing)
(boys singing softly)

17:30.792 --> 17:31.959
(whimpers)

17:31.959 --> 17:35.583
I hate my sisters so much.

17:35.583 --> 17:39.709
They made me look
like a fuckin' loser
in my daddy's eyes.

17:39.709 --> 17:40.834
Fuck that!

17:40.834 --> 17:43.083
I should expose them.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.125
What do you mean by expose?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.959
I used to read
all their diaries.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.458
I know their deepest,
darkest secrets.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.166
They don't want me speaking
at the ceremony?

17:51.166 --> 17:52.583
Well, tough shit.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.417
I will put them
on blast.

17:56.417 --> 17:59.000
I will let the world
know what deceitful
little cunts they are.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.959
This is about celebrating
your dad's life,

18:00.959 --> 18:03.166
not waging war
against your sisters.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.000
Please, my brain
is working, Christine.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.625
What's this I'm hearing
about a consultancy firm
that Lee hired?

18:09.625 --> 18:11.291
Lee hired a consulting firm?

18:11.291 --> 18:12.667
Uh, yeah, the SweatDogs.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.625
The what? SweatDogs?

18:14.625 --> 18:16.333
They are
a world-renowned outfit.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.000
You know, they do
Fortune 500 companies,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.750
teach team-building.
Look, all I know is,

18:19.750 --> 18:21.667
I'm getting bombed
with complaints

18:21.667 --> 18:24.834
from frustrated teachers
about this being the cherry

18:24.834 --> 18:27.667
on top of an
impossible workload.

18:27.667 --> 18:30.166
I mean, this
wasn't in the budget.
Why wasn't I informed?

18:30.166 --> 18:32.709
Would you mind if I make
a quick phone call?
I can find out.

18:32.709 --> 18:34.125
I would love for you
to check on this.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.250
Okay, I'm going to leave,
then I'm going to be right back.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.834
That would be
a swell idea,

18:37.834 --> 18:40.000
and be right back
with that information.
I'll find out the answers.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.792
Be right back.
Be right back if you can.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.000
Out.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.000
(phone vibrates)

18:46.000 --> 18:48.291
Well, you didn't fuck
everything up already,
did you, Gamby?

18:48.291 --> 18:50.125
No! I'm calling
about the SweatDogs.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.375
The teachers
complained to Haas

18:51.375 --> 18:52.750
and now he's over here
flipping out!

18:52.750 --> 18:54.083
Saying this thing
wasn't approved

18:54.083 --> 18:55.500
and it's not
in the fuckin' budget.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.875
Just fuckin' calm down.
Just lie to the man.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.250
Look, man,
lies might slide easily

18:59.250 --> 19:01.125
off your oily lips,
but I'm not like you.

19:01.125 --> 19:04.000
Which is why you are
a goober who couldn't hack it
as a principal.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.083
Don't give me that shit.
It's not like you're having
your fair share of problems.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.417
You're pushing
the teachers too far.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.792
Don't you tell me
how to run my school.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.750
Just tell Haas
that the SweatDogs

19:13.750 --> 19:16.166
are doing it pro gratis.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.458
That means free, dummy.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.709
No way. No way.
I'm not going to sit here

19:19.709 --> 19:21.375
and just bald-face lie
to Superintendent Haas.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.208
Well, then I will
find someone who will!

19:25.166 --> 19:26.500
God damn it.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.083
Hey! Principal for a day!

19:30.083 --> 19:31.583
Fuck off, Willows.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.083
I'm back.
(crunches)

19:34.083 --> 19:36.667
Sir, I think I got to the bottom
of this whole SweatDogs thing.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.125
SweatDogs.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.750
It would appear that they are
doing their services for us

19:40.750 --> 19:43.125
pro gracias, uh,
which means for free.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.750
Hmm. Free, huh?
Yeah.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.500
Hmm. I gotta tell
you something.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.250
I've never seen morale
so low around here.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.542
What, with all
that's befallen this school,

19:51.542 --> 19:54.542
it's like North Jackson's lost
its will to live, Gamby.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.041
(crunches)

19:56.041 --> 19:57.583
But, hey...

19:57.583 --> 20:00.250
maybe Lee has finally come up
with something to turn it
all around.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.250
You think?
Yeah, I hope so.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.583
SweatDog:
Here I am!

20:03.583 --> 20:04.917
Teachers:
Here I am!

20:04.917 --> 20:07.875
Here you are!
Here you are!

20:07.875 --> 20:11.041
Here we are!
Here we are!

20:11.041 --> 20:13.458
I move forward!
We move forward!

20:13.458 --> 20:15.959
We are a team!
We are a team!

20:15.959 --> 20:18.625
Gamby, this is
some weird stuff.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.083
On the ground.
On your face!

20:20.083 --> 20:22.583
You have a problem
with authority, sir?

20:22.583 --> 20:24.333
Yes, we are!
Yes, we are!

20:24.333 --> 20:25.959
Yes, we are!
Yes, we are!

20:25.959 --> 20:27.750
Yes, we are!
Yes, we are!

20:27.750 --> 20:31.083
Yes, we are!
Yes, we are!

20:31.083 --> 20:35.250
Boys:
♪ Here I am, Lord ♪

20:35.250 --> 20:39.083
♪ Is it I, Lord? ♪

20:39.083 --> 20:42.125

20:42.125 --> 20:46.792

We're going
to miss you, Daddy.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.083
I love you, Daddy.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.291
(whispers)
No.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.333
(sisters muttering)
No. Lee...

21:17.333 --> 21:21.166
(scuffling)
(muttering)

21:23.458 --> 21:24.959
Russell:
Excuse me.

21:24.959 --> 21:26.500
Hello. Thank you, thank you...

21:26.500 --> 21:27.875
Thank you.

21:27.875 --> 21:30.291
Uh, I just, I wanted to say...

21:30.291 --> 21:32.041
a few words, so...

21:32.041 --> 21:33.583
Uh...

21:34.834 --> 21:36.542
My daddy,

21:36.542 --> 21:39.875
always spent a hell of a lot
more time with my sisters

21:39.875 --> 21:42.917
than he ever did with me.

21:42.917 --> 21:44.709
But...

21:44.709 --> 21:46.959
he didn't know
what I've always known

21:46.959 --> 21:49.959
about them.

21:49.959 --> 21:51.750
Which is...

21:55.875 --> 21:58.709
Whi-Which is...

21:58.709 --> 22:02.333
(Lee sighs)

22:02.333 --> 22:05.750
That they were the
luckiest girls in the world
to have had a father like him.

22:07.500 --> 22:12.375
One of my fondest
memories of Daddy

22:12.375 --> 22:14.709
was helping him
build his, his...

22:14.709 --> 22:16.834
model airplanes.

22:16.834 --> 22:21.875
If, uh... I would hand him
the wrong part and he would say:

22:21.875 --> 22:24.208
"No, Lee! Damn it!

22:24.208 --> 22:26.000
"You need to focus.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.041
You need to pay attention,"

22:28.041 --> 22:32.000
and I would hand him
the right part

22:32.000 --> 22:35.208
and he would just nod.

22:36.542 --> 22:39.333
I cherish those times.

22:39.333 --> 22:41.792
Because it meant
that he cared enough

22:41.792 --> 22:45.750
about me to teach me
how to improve myself,

22:45.750 --> 22:50.291
how to strive for the best,
how to reach for the top.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.417
That's what he instilled in me.

22:56.083 --> 23:00.417
I wish that he could see
my life now.

23:01.625 --> 23:05.542
I have a...
a beautiful wife, Christine,

23:05.542 --> 23:09.667
and my... well, my Korean
mother-in-law, Mi-Cha.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.709
I take care of her.

23:11.709 --> 23:13.834
And I have a...

23:13.834 --> 23:16.125
Well, I have a very nice home.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.709
I'm-I'm even the...

23:20.709 --> 23:23.625
the principal
of my very own school.

23:26.542 --> 23:28.834
He would be proud...

23:28.834 --> 23:31.250
of me.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.792
I think he would.

23:33.959 --> 23:36.041
Because I...

23:36.041 --> 23:38.792
I, too, reached the top,

23:38.792 --> 23:40.834
like he...

23:40.834 --> 23:42.500
like he did.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.542
Bye-bye, Daddy.

23:58.333 --> 23:59.417
Move it.
Let's go.

23:59.417 --> 24:02.250
Go, go, go.
Move it!
(coughs)

24:02.250 --> 24:05.000
SweatDog:
What are you doing?
I need water.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.208
What?
I need some water.

24:07.208 --> 24:08.709
SweatDog:
No water for anyone

24:08.709 --> 24:12.333
until this weakling
finishes the exercise.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.750
I'm just a drama teacher,
you guys.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.000
I can't do this.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.041
Well, then, maybe,
it is time you be

24:18.041 --> 24:20.834
just a drama teacher
someplace else,

24:20.834 --> 24:22.542
because it is teachers

24:22.542 --> 24:24.583
with a limited
view of themselves

24:24.583 --> 24:26.375
that is keeping this place

24:26.375 --> 24:28.041
from reaching
its full potential.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.250
This place is
the bottom of the barrel.

24:30.250 --> 24:31.917
Why?

24:31.917 --> 24:33.250
Because of you.

24:33.250 --> 24:35.625
Because of you and you

24:35.625 --> 24:38.000
and you and you and you.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.709
Yes, you specifically,

24:39.709 --> 24:41.250
and you and you.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.166
Yes, you and you

24:43.166 --> 24:44.375
and you...
No!

24:44.375 --> 24:46.166
That's enough!
That's enough right there.

24:46.166 --> 24:48.542
Get up, Seychelles, come on.
Excuse me, Mr. Gamby.
What are you doing?

24:48.542 --> 24:51.875
I'm giving the drama teacher
a glass of water, okay?

24:51.875 --> 24:53.000
Here.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.166
Actually, can I have
a San Pelligrino? My stomach--

24:57.166 --> 24:59.750
You don't know
the first thing about
what's wrong with this school.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.250
Mm.
Okay, fine, yes.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.250
Teachers can be lazy.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.375
They can be
bitch-ass complainers.

25:05.375 --> 25:07.291
But these aren't
just any teachers.

25:07.291 --> 25:09.583
These are
North Jackson teachers.

25:09.583 --> 25:11.875
So take Seychelles,
for instance, okay?

25:11.875 --> 25:13.083
He took a one act play

25:13.083 --> 25:14.917
all the way
to the state competition.

25:14.917 --> 25:17.834
It came in third, but still,
he got us to states.

25:17.834 --> 25:19.250
And then there's Ms. Deets.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.834
She did this thing
with her class, uh,
Pottery for Poverty.

25:21.834 --> 25:24.291
It raised more money--
You're not going
to start listing off

25:24.291 --> 25:25.750
a bunch of
bullshit achievements

25:25.750 --> 25:27.375
of your staff right now,
are you?

25:27.375 --> 25:30.125
How sentimental
and uninspired

25:30.125 --> 25:32.959
from the vice principal.

25:32.959 --> 25:34.709
You see, after watching,

25:34.709 --> 25:36.417
how you've handled
these people today,

25:36.417 --> 25:39.375
it makes complete sense
that you would never, ever,

25:39.375 --> 25:40.750
get this job for real.

25:40.750 --> 25:44.000
You're a loser who commands
no respect, whatsoever.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.542
Fuck you!

25:45.542 --> 25:46.583
Fuck you.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.792
I respect him.
Oh.

25:49.792 --> 25:51.083
This school has had worse.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.667
Guess what? You guys
can blow it out your dicks.

25:54.667 --> 25:58.917
Wow, let's see, that's...
three teachers.

25:58.917 --> 26:01.291
(giggles)

26:11.750 --> 26:13.291
I see.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.333
How about you three
take your berets,

26:15.333 --> 26:17.959
your kettlebells,
and your yoga mats

26:17.959 --> 26:19.458
and shove them up your ass.

26:19.458 --> 26:21.834
I'm the principal,
I call the shots,

26:21.834 --> 26:24.625
so get the fuck
out of here right now!

26:24.625 --> 26:27.500
No, Shawn. It's fine.
We've billed them.
They've paid.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.375
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em all. Come, on.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.250
Good riddance,

26:32.250 --> 26:33.500

Go, Gamby!

26:43.542 --> 26:45.667
Gamby:
Don't tell Russell.
Don't tell Russell, okay?

26:45.667 --> 26:47.834
Seriously, don't tell him
what happened.

27:00.875 --> 27:02.125

27:03.333 --> 27:05.542

Don't worry, I won't.

I've let it go.
