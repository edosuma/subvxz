These are Thomas' people.

00:06.973 --> 00:07.962
You okay?

00:08.475 --> 00:09.999
Your house is
back there, Leila.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.338
Are you telling me
that I can't Ieave?

00:11.678 --> 00:15.943
We will bring
all our people here
and make this planet our own.

00:16.383 --> 00:18.248
Ifyou aren't with us,
then you're against us.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.151
I'II never go
along with genocide.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.779
I'm sorry, Simon.

00:22.989 --> 00:25.116
I've asked everyone
with White House clearance

00:25.225 --> 00:26.624
to sign the testing agreement.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.786
You should know that
there was one holdout.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.851
Who?
Your wife.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.827
And how do you expect me
to find Dempsey
when he's in France?

00:33.933 --> 00:35.628
You just get us there,
and I'II worry about the rest.

00:35.735 --> 00:38.727
My contact tells me
he's taken a place
at the Chateau de Perrault.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.196

00:45.812 --> 00:46.801
Run, Sean!

00:46.913 --> 00:47.902
Run!

00:47.981 --> 00:49.710
Nice to see you again,
Ms. Roberts.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.307
Why do you care so
much about Walker?

00:51.384 --> 00:53.875
Because every time
I've put
an obstacle in his path,

00:53.953 --> 00:55.716
he has found some
way to surmount it.

00:56.689 --> 00:57.917

01:38.798 --> 01:40.026
No signs of
security in the front

01:40.200 --> 01:41.428
or back entrance
of the building,

01:41.501 --> 01:43.230

01:45.205 --> 01:47.230

has Iocked down the perimeter,

01:47.307 --> 01:48.296

It's Herbert. They're coming.
They have me surrounded.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.712
Stay calm.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.653
First, send us everything
you have, right now.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.682
Listen to me,
this is important.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.317
They can't know
what you've been working on.

02:42.595 --> 02:44.563
Do you understand?
Sophia, no.

02:44.631 --> 02:45.620
Not a trace.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.932
But Sophia,
I've worked so hard.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.059
Please, I'm so close.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.728
I'm sorry, Herbert.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.938
You know what you have to do.

03:22.468 --> 03:23.935
(BANGING ON DOOR)

03:26.306 --> 03:28.137
Herbert Mills,
you're under arrest!

03:28.708 --> 03:31.199
Put your hands
behind your head
and get down on the ground!

03:31.578 --> 03:33.409
Get down on the ground, now!

03:34.080 --> 03:35.377
On the ground!

03:53.600 --> 03:54.999
There isn't
room on this planet

03:55.101 --> 03:58.969
to accommodate our
entire population
of 2.5 billion,

03:59.272 --> 04:01.672
and their safety
is my only priority.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.937
So, we will have to

04:05.445 --> 04:07.174
(SIGHS) affect changes here.

04:08.715 --> 04:12.742
The native population
will be winnowed
substantially.

04:13.886 --> 04:18.016
We're working on a weapon
to make that happen
quickly and efficiently.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.654
Herbert Mills was close
to finding that weapon,

04:21.761 --> 04:23.626
but the government
found him Iast night,

04:23.696 --> 04:25.664
and then he killed
himself to avoid capture.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.963
But before doing so,
he uploaded
the research that he'd found.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.659
Aaron,

04:33.706 --> 04:35.936
you'II be in
charge of analyzing
the data he sent.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.368
The sooner we find
the weapon and use it,

04:38.544 --> 04:40.637
the sooner our
people will be safe.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.179
I'II get right on it.
Good.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.911
If they can find Mills,
they can find any of us.

04:46.219 --> 04:49.313
If that happens,
this whole thing
comes crashing down

04:49.389 --> 04:51.516
along with the
future of our people.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.719
You're right.
I've been thinking
a Iot about that.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.553
We can't move
forward if we have to keep

04:57.697 --> 04:59.221
Iooking over our
shoulders Iike this.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.029
We need to
disrupt the government,
throw it into disarray,

05:02.101 --> 05:03.090
so they stop hunting us.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.760
At Ieast until we
find the weapon.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.298
How?

05:08.174 --> 05:09.300
Cut off the head.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.673
We will take out
President Martinez

05:16.683 --> 05:17.672
permanently.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.914
There were no
survivors from
our attack

05:21.087 --> 05:22.884
on the two
busloads of
SIeepers,

05:22.989 --> 05:25.253
but an analysis of clues
found on their bodies

05:25.658 --> 05:28.149
Ied us to this man,
Herbert Mills.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.027
A ground operation
was Iaunched
to apprehend him.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.759
Unfortunately,
our agents did
not anticipate

05:33.833 --> 05:36.393
how far he
would go to
avoid capture.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.437
This man was in a Iab.
What was he doing there?

05:38.504 --> 05:39.664
We're not sure.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.297
Before he jumped,
he engaged a
comprehensive protocol

05:42.408 --> 05:44.376
that destroyed most
of the evidence there.
Thank you.

05:44.610 --> 05:48.740
AII we could determine
was that he was
studying ice-core samples.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.715
Ice-core samples?

05:52.752 --> 05:54.879
Do you have any idea why,
or where they were from?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.680
No on both counts,
I'm afraid.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.347
Well, I think it's
safe to assume it has

05:58.491 --> 06:00.049
something to
do with their
overall goal

06:00.159 --> 06:01.649
to bring more of
their own people here.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.092
We can't assume
anything.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.455
The game has changed,
gentlemen.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.827
With their attack
on the Washington Monument

06:06.899 --> 06:10.096
and our counter strike,
we are now at war with
the non-terrestrials.

06:10.636 --> 06:14.538
Which means,
it's possible Sophia
will go on the offensive.

06:14.607 --> 06:15.938
And if she does,
we need to know

06:16.008 --> 06:18.169
what she's going to
do and be ready for it.

06:18.244 --> 06:21.042
This is a war we must win.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.974
Maybe it's a war we
shouldn't fight alone.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.816
Maybe we should
come clean about

06:31.991 --> 06:34.186
the aliens' existence
to other world Ieaders

06:34.494 --> 06:35.984
and ask for some help.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.931
When I want your opinion,
I'II ask for it.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.002
Mr. President,
I'm only trying to...

06:49.175 --> 06:50.506
Am I understood?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.438
Yes, Mr. President.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.143
I'm sorry to
interrupt,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.118
but Senator
Lewis has asked
to see you.

07:02.188 --> 07:03.177
She says it's urgent.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.014
We're done here.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.318
Thank you, gentlemen.
Sir.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.822
Thank you, Mr. President.

07:28.147 --> 07:29.978
Lower Ninth,
after Hurricane Katrina.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.542
We went down to
rebuild 14 homes
in 30 days.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.280
The First Lady
Iooks Iovely, as always.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.344
I have five minutes, Senator.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.446
Of course.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.784
The test results of
our blood screenings

07:40.960 --> 07:42.587
for all White House
personnel came back.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.390
And?
Everyone who took the test

07:44.497 --> 07:46.897
came back negative
for non-terrestrial DNA.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.196
Good. Good work.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.067
We can at Ieast rule
out the possibility

07:51.237 --> 07:52.636
of more SIeepers
within our ranks.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.036
Not exactly, Mr. President.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.438
Everyone who took the test
came back negative.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.434
There is still one hold out.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.267
Your wife.

08:01.547 --> 08:05.313
Once again, I'm comfortable
with the First
Lady's decision.

08:05.384 --> 08:08.217
She's taking a moral stand,
I respect that.
And so should you, Senator.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.981
My job,
the job you tasked me with,

08:12.058 --> 08:14.356
has been compromised.
Obstructed even.

08:15.394 --> 08:17.658
And I can't
allow that to happen.

08:19.966 --> 08:20.955
What is that?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.399
I took the Iiberty of
digging a Iittle deeper
into your wife's past.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.525
Family history, records.

08:24.804 --> 08:25.793
You did what?

08:25.905 --> 08:27.463
And there are
inconsistencies.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.599
There are dates and places
that don't correspond.

08:29.709 --> 08:30.767
You can't be serious.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.068
People that
don't exist.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.133
AII right, stop.

08:33.578 --> 08:36.571
You're suggesting my
wife is one of them.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.719
So, she, what,
she married me
15 years ago,

08:40.785 --> 08:42.754
in hopes that I
would become president
one day,

08:42.822 --> 08:45.120
and then she'd be able
to infiltrate my
administration?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.250
Explain to me how any of that
makes any sense.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.424
This woman, Sophia,
is a brilliant strategist.

08:51.497 --> 08:54.591
Maybe early on
they identified you
as promising,

08:54.667 --> 08:56.134
a political up-and-comer.
Ridiculous.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.930
Once you were together,
didn't Christina

08:58.104 --> 08:59.833
encourage your
political career?

09:00.573 --> 09:03.041
Advise you?
Support, even suggest

09:03.843 --> 09:05.777
your decision to
free Sophia's people...

09:05.912 --> 09:06.901
Enough!

09:06.979 --> 09:10.210
Listen, it's my wife
you're talking about.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.609
Any attack on her
is an attack on me.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.777
And that is
a fight you will Iose.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.891
Hurricane Katrina
was six years ago,
wasn't it?

09:27.967 --> 09:29.594
Christina hasn't aged a day.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.902
Get out.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.842
Eva, did I
have any calls?

09:44.016 --> 09:45.745
Just your wife,
Mr. Vice President.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.454
How about my schedule
for the rest of the day?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.888
You're wide open.
Except for a
photo op at 3:00.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.380
Photo op?

09:53.559 --> 09:54.548
With the Iocal
fire-fighters' union,

09:54.660 --> 09:56.855
in honor of their
service during the
attacks on the monument.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.305
Hello?
Vice President Jarvis?

10:09.709 --> 10:11.472
Yes. Who is this?

10:11.544 --> 10:13.671
How did you get this number?

10:13.846 --> 10:15.973
It's not important.
It's Sophia.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.640
Don't bother trying
to trace this call.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.308
The hell I won't try.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.787
PIease, Mr. Vice
President. Don't.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.981
We've
neutralized any intercepts
on your phone.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.153
Are you alone?
What?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.960
I'm asking you, are you alone?

10:30.262 --> 10:34.289
Yes, I'm alone.
Look, what the hell
is this all about?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.635
You expect me
to have
a conversation with you?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.296
You murdered
innocent Americans!

10:39.372 --> 10:41.135
And it broke my
heart to do so.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.399
President Martinez
forced my hand.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.502
If he'd been
willing to negotiate,
no one would have gotten hurt.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.144
(STUTTERING) I don't
believe that.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.212
We will find you
and we will punish you
for what you have done.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.710
Think about it.

10:53.786 --> 10:58.155
It was Martinez's actions,
not my own,
that escalated the conflict,

10:58.224 --> 11:01.387
caused this senseless
and tragic loss of life.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.158
Why are you calling me?

11:07.433 --> 11:10.596
We both know that
if things continue
down this path,

11:10.670 --> 11:12.968
more of your people
will end up dying.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.205
That's a threat.
It's a plea

11:16.075 --> 11:17.542
to avoid more bloodshed.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.203
Which is what will happen
ifMartinez has his way.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.337
Avoid it how?

11:23.416 --> 11:25.509
By the two of us
working together.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.185
I'd Iike to meet
with you in person
to talk about it.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.482
You and me working together?

11:31.991 --> 11:33.925
What exactly are
you talking about?

11:34.126 --> 11:37.118
I'm talking about
making you President.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.339
(HUFFING)

13:40.853 --> 13:41.911
Come on.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.319
(COUGHING)

13:55.568 --> 13:57.195
(WHISPERING) Sean...

14:02.341 --> 14:04.241
Impressive, Mr. Walker.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.039
I think it's time
we had a Iittle talk.

14:43.949 --> 14:44.938
(GROANING GASPS)

14:47.519 --> 14:48.508
(YELLS)

14:52.224 --> 14:55.455
Luis! Luis! Help!

14:56.662 --> 14:57.651
Luis!

14:59.598 --> 15:01.065
(STUTTERING) What
did you do?
I...

15:01.734 --> 15:03.429
It was an accident.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.732
I was just trying to cut that
and it just slipped.

15:07.539 --> 15:08.528
(PANTING)

15:11.577 --> 15:13.977
Here. Press it
against the wound.
Mm.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.673
We have a medic.
She can take care
ofyou. AII right?

15:37.937 --> 15:38.926
Come this way.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.432
That should heal
without much of a scar,

15:43.542 --> 15:46.568
but you need to
change your dressings
at Ieast two times a day.

15:46.645 --> 15:47.634
Okay.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.069
AII done.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.108
Do you think I could
stay here for a bit?

15:53.185 --> 15:54.846
I'm still feeling
a Iittle nauseous.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.109
Of course.

16:18.677 --> 16:19.666
Simon,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.004
can you talk?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.785
I know my father
is the one who
turned you in,

16:27.987 --> 16:29.249
so I know what
you must think,

16:29.321 --> 16:30.618
but I had
nothing to
do with it.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.318
What do you want?

16:32.958 --> 16:35.483
Why were you gonna
tell the government
where we are?

16:35.561 --> 16:39.520
Because Sophia,
she's bringing all
of our people here.

16:40.232 --> 16:43.724
But in order to do that,
she needs to
make room for them.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.872
It means genocide
for humans, Leila.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.873
Wiping them out.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.743
There's seven billion people
on Earth, that's...

16:52.845 --> 16:54.210
She can't.
That's not possible.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.711
But it's already begun.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.643
I managed to Iook
through Thomas' house.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.811
There were maps
of Siberia,
near Murmansk.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.918
They're Iooking
for some kind of
weapon there.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.122
A woman's name
had been written

17:06.191 --> 17:09.319
on one of the maps.
Irina Bogdanov.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.858
You need to get
word out. We have
to stop her.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.262
They took my cell.
I tried using the phone
at the house, it's dead.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.164
Sophia's Iieutenants.
They have phones.

17:17.236 --> 17:18.794
I want you to
call the authorities.

17:19.171 --> 17:22.196
Anyone you can get a hold of,
you need to warn them.

17:24.009 --> 17:26.204
Go. Get help.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.510
Go.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.174
We'II need to
sweep the room.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.738
That won't be
necessary.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.941
It's
protocol.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.114
The room
is clear.

18:10.556 --> 18:11.648
Sir.

18:12.157 --> 18:13.818
I trust you won't
mention this to anyone.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.588
Yes, sir.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.165
Mr. Vice President,
I'm so glad you
agreed to meet.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.264
We have much to discuss.

18:29.341 --> 18:32.504
The only reason why
I'm here is to put
an end to this.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.338
Somehow I suspect
that's not entirely true.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.938
You're a murderer
and a war criminal.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.710
Give me one reason not
to pull this trigger.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.684
If you kill me,
you'II make me
a martyr for my people.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.484
More Americans
will end up dying.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.701
Why should I
believe a word you say?

19:00.038 --> 19:02.563
My people are coming
here in great numbers.

19:02.674 --> 19:05.939
The human population
will have to be
substantially reduced.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.238
We will fight back.

19:07.379 --> 19:08.573
And you will Iose.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.046
You saw the destruction
that we are capable of.

19:11.116 --> 19:14.313
Believe me when I tell you,
that was only the beginning.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.485
Why are you telling me this?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.514
It's regrettable,
but some countries
will have to be destroyed

19:19.591 --> 19:22.389
while others will be allowed
to coexist with us.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.557
I'm offering you the chance
to save your country.

19:26.098 --> 19:30.467
You think we'II just sit back
and allow you to
take over the world?

19:30.903 --> 19:33.201
That is not America.
That is not who we are.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.240
No, no one is
suggesting that
you sit back.

19:35.707 --> 19:39.074
I want you to
take an active role
in the new order.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.272
I have always believed
that through
cooperation and trust,

19:42.381 --> 19:44.713
our people can
Iive together.

19:45.083 --> 19:49.520
Unfortunately, your
president no Ionger
shares this vision.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.682
He is blinded by hatred,
intent on war.

19:54.159 --> 19:57.128
But the tragic fact remains
that Martinez
won't Iisten to reason.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.993
Not from you, not from anyone.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.766
So we are Ieft with a more

20:04.403 --> 20:06.462
permanent solution.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.532
No.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.878
With a more
rational Ieader
in power,

20:15.948 --> 20:20.078
we can negotiate the terms
of our coexistence
without violence.

20:20.385 --> 20:24.446
No.
You are that Ieader,
Mr. Vice President.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.515
You hold the future of America
in your hands.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.226
This is insane.
We will
help you.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.398
It will be
clean.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.100
Untraceable.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.066
A culmination of
your Iifelong devotion
to this country.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.760
I tried waiting up.
I really did.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.059
Mm.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.509
I Iove you.

21:20.812 --> 21:21.801
So much.

21:23.649 --> 21:24.638
Me, too.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.242
We barely see
each other anymore,

21:28.320 --> 21:30.151
and the time we
have is fraught.

21:34.626 --> 21:38.255
I am sorry.
I wanna be the man
you fell in Iove with.

21:39.031 --> 21:43.263
No matter how hard times are,
whenever I Iook at you,
EIias, you are.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.533
You really are.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.531
I can picture
us in Belize.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.632
Mm-hmm.

21:50.776 --> 21:51.800
Where I fell in
Iove with you.

21:51.877 --> 21:52.901
(CHUCKLES)

21:52.978 --> 21:55.037
Your head was all
in those guidebooks.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.348
(LAUGHS) Meanwhile,
the sights were all
around you.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.111
Yeah, well, I didn't
want to miss anything.

21:59.184 --> 22:00.549
(LAUGHING)
SIide over.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.284
You had
everything all
planned out.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.953
And you were not
having any of it.
That's what I remember of it.

22:06.925 --> 22:09.155
'Cause I didn't care
about seeing the sights.

22:09.461 --> 22:13.727
I'd seen them all
before. I only cared
about being with you.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.024
(SIGHS)

22:18.837 --> 22:19.895
What do you mean?

22:20.839 --> 22:21.828
About what?

22:22.207 --> 22:24.869
You said you had
seen everything before.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.472
But how could you?
You'd never been
before that trip.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.006
I meant pictures.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.517
It sounded Iike you
had been there before.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.046
No.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.112
(LAUGHS)

22:46.264 --> 22:49.825
You also said, at the time,
that your family was there.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.494
We never saw them.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.500
It was so Iong ago,
I don't remember.

22:58.276 --> 23:01.245
Let's just go
to sleep. It's
getting Iate.

23:06.585 --> 23:07.745
Uh-huh. Okay.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.153
Got it. I'II have
the senator call you
as soon as she's available.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.486
Can I help you?

23:15.560 --> 23:16.959
I'm here to see
Catherine.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.557
The President is here.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.636
Sir?

23:26.938 --> 23:29.031
If this is
about the other day,
please forgive me.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.573
Sometimes I don't
know when to stop.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.066
Where's the file?

23:34.112 --> 23:35.374
Why? Did something happen?

23:38.216 --> 23:39.308
Where's the file?

23:54.199 --> 23:56.224
How many people
know about this?

23:56.301 --> 23:57.666
Nobody but me.

23:59.137 --> 24:00.263
Let's keep it that way.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.008
Mr. President?

24:10.115 --> 24:11.412
I'm sorry.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.707
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

24:16.254 --> 24:19.018
BIake, we
need to talk.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.926
Aren't you supposed
to be giving a tour
to someone?

24:22.527 --> 24:25.587
I will not just shut up
and keep my head down.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.859
Not when the future
of our country
hangs in the balance.

24:29.634 --> 24:30.999
Okay.

24:31.603 --> 24:34.663
The President's
hatred for Sophia
is clouding his judgment.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.666
Is that right?

24:36.741 --> 24:39.107
His refusal to
negotiate with her

24:39.311 --> 24:41.711
will only Iead
to massive death
and destruction.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.906
You honestly expect him
to negotiate with a terrorist

24:45.016 --> 24:47.109
responsible for hundreds
of American casualties?

24:47.219 --> 24:49.210
Hundreds will
turn into millions.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.345
You saw what
they're capable of.

24:50.522 --> 24:51.614
We can't back down

24:51.690 --> 24:52.952
at their first
show of strength.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.849
I shouldn't need
to tell you...

24:54.926 --> 24:57.292
BIake, we will Iose this war.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.387
We will Iose everything.

24:59.464 --> 25:02.627
Compromise, diplomacy,
that's what's needed here.

25:03.702 --> 25:06.637
The President's
relationship with Sophia
is poisoned.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.500
But maybe I can talk to her.

25:10.542 --> 25:11.566
What?

25:11.676 --> 25:13.507
I have diplomatic experience.

25:13.745 --> 25:15.736
Let me see if I can
come up with some
kind of an agreement.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.441
A treaty for coexistence.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.140
You can't be serious.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.919
This country means
everything to me, BIake.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.150
Just give me a chance

25:27.125 --> 25:30.117
to preserve
our nation and
our way of Iife.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.592
I can help, I promise you.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.686
You promise?

25:33.765 --> 25:36.598
You think a promise from you
means anything?

25:37.269 --> 25:38.531
After everything you've done,

25:38.770 --> 25:41.398
you expect to
Iead negotiations
with a non-terrestrial enemy.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.129
Just one more chance,
that's all...

25:43.208 --> 25:44.766
You used your Iast
chance a Iong time ago.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.842
BIake...
As far as I'm concerned,

25:46.912 --> 25:48.573
you should be in prison.

25:50.148 --> 25:51.172
The President is
Ietting you play out

25:51.249 --> 25:53.149
your term for
appearances only.

25:53.451 --> 25:55.476
No one trusts you.

25:56.321 --> 25:58.152
And no one forgives you.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.986
You have a year
and a half Ieft.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.085
So, please, Raymond,

26:03.728 --> 26:06.856
just shut up and
keep your head down.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.931
Mills used soil
frozen in the ice cores

26:17.108 --> 26:19.167
to help pinpoint the
Iocation of the weapon.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.802
The shifts in
mineral composition

26:20.879 --> 26:23.439
and desiccation
Ied him to focus on

26:23.982 --> 26:27.679

near the Dolgan Coast.

26:28.186 --> 26:29.448
Thank you, Aaron.

finding it.
So close.

about your proposal.

Good.

I Iove this country.

26:47.172 --> 26:49.868
I know.
That's why I came to you.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.539
I don't think I could Iive
with myself, knowing I...

26:54.112 --> 26:56.979
I could have prevented
the death of millions.

26:57.749 --> 26:59.649
The end of our nation,

26:59.718 --> 27:02.050
the end of our
civilization as we know it.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.186
I don't see any other way

27:07.559 --> 27:08.548
but to work together.

27:11.496 --> 27:15.364
You made the right decision.

thank you one day.

I pray that you're right.

and by this time tomorrow,

27:44.195 --> 27:45.492

to come in?

tell me where you are.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.494
I don't know.

29:18.556 --> 29:21.184
It's a housing development

30:19.217 --> 30:20.707
Mr. Walker,

30:21.319 --> 30:24.516
I can see in your eyes
how you feel about me,

30:24.722 --> 30:27.691
but you should know
that everything I've done

30:28.226 --> 30:30.421
was with the best
of intentions.

30:30.728 --> 30:33.196
So I could stop
what's about to happen.

30:33.598 --> 30:36.396
He's insane, Sean.
Don't Iisten to him.

30:36.467 --> 30:40.096
The non-terrestrials
have been coming here
for thousands of years.

30:40.572 --> 30:44.008
I am part of a
tribe of sentinels,

30:44.309 --> 30:46.607
who have been
here just as Iong

30:46.978 --> 30:49.344
trying to protect
humanity from them.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.806
Right now,
the biggest
threat we face,

30:52.951 --> 30:55.249
is from a woman that
you know as Sophia.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.345
You're wrong.

30:57.422 --> 31:00.619
She's trying to protect us
from her own people.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.386
She may have been.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.124
But it became clear to us

31:05.230 --> 31:08.722
that eventually she
would dedicate herself
to our extinction.

31:10.768 --> 31:12.258
How could you know that?

31:12.770 --> 31:14.670
Our sentinels

31:14.873 --> 31:16.272
have been around

31:16.374 --> 31:17.363
for more than
three millennia.

31:19.043 --> 31:22.240
We can see the real
tapestry of history,

31:22.313 --> 31:26.443
the Iarger sweeping
events to come.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.113
This tells us
that someone outside

31:29.187 --> 31:31.553
of our group might be
able to stop Sophia.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.516
It seems obvious to me now

31:35.293 --> 31:37.284
that someone is you.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.292
Look at the path
that you've carved

31:40.365 --> 31:42.196
for yourself
since the beginning.

31:43.635 --> 31:48.368
A young man without
resources taking on
the government and myself,

31:48.940 --> 31:51.568
to the point where you've
tracked me way out here.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.174
Managed to save
Ms. Roberts' Iife.

31:56.547 --> 32:00.415
That was
the point where your place
in the tapestry of events

32:01.386 --> 32:03.286
was clear.

32:05.390 --> 32:09.793
What do you say
to that, Mr. Walker?
The truth.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.556
The truth is
you're a monster.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.396
An evil, crazy
old man with enough
money and power

32:16.467 --> 32:20.733
to force everyone to
pay for your delusions.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.037
As Iong as I'm alive,
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to stop you

32:26.110 --> 32:29.307
and make you
pay for everything
that you've done.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.082
I would expect no Iess.

32:33.918 --> 32:36.409
But I have to move
you away from that now

32:36.487 --> 32:39.820
and on to what
really needs to be done.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.091
I see only one
way to do that.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.289
This man

32:44.429 --> 32:45.794
will give you something that

32:45.863 --> 32:46.852
should be helpful.

32:47.932 --> 32:51.026
It's not clear ifyou'II
be able to stop Sophia,

32:51.436 --> 32:52.630
or how,

32:54.706 --> 32:56.901
but you have the best chance.

I'm just trying to
make everything add up.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.972
Why? What he
told you doesn't
make any sense.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.841
(SCOFFS) I know that,
but it did to him. Otherwise,
why kill himself?

34:07.912 --> 34:09.469

My father's people.
