00:04.705 --> 00:07.341
- AS WE RODE OUT
INTO ANOTHER CHICAGO MORNING,

00:07.375 --> 00:09.877
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

00:09.910 --> 00:12.846
WE KNEW NOT WHAT TO EXPECT.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.216
WE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT AWAITED US.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.151
- BRIAN,
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING, BUDDY?

00:17.185 --> 00:18.686
- JUST FOUND OUT MY PHONE HAS
THIS REALLY COOL

00:18.719 --> 00:20.254
RECORDING APP AND WAS LIKE,

00:20.288 --> 00:23.157
"HELLO, I OBVIOUSLY NEED TO
DICTATE MY MEMOIRS."

00:23.191 --> 00:24.158
- OH, OBVIOUSLY.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.026
- SO, UM, NO SPOILERS,

00:26.060 --> 00:28.062
BUT YOU'RE BOTH HEAVILY FEATURED
IN MY BOOK.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.030
- GREAT.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.032
- EVERYONE,
BRIAN IS WRITING HIS MEMOIRS.

00:32.066 --> 00:34.835
SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY
AND DO IN FRONT OF HIM.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.204
YOU COULD END UP
IN A BEST SELLER.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.205
- [laughing]

00:37.238 --> 00:38.772
- GOOD FOR YOU, BRIAN.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.509
STATS HERE.
I'VE BEEN WRITING A BOOK TOO.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.211
IT'S AN EROTIC SPACE FANTASY

00:43.244 --> 00:46.247
ABOUT A BRAINY WOMAN ASTRONAUT
WHO'S LOST IN SPACE,

00:46.280 --> 00:48.549
AND SHE FINDS HERSELF
ON A PLANET INHABITED

00:48.582 --> 00:50.050
BY HANDSOME MALE ALIENS.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.252
- I'M LISTENING.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.420
- IT'S REALLY COOL.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.288
THE PLANET HAS THREE MOONS.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.424
- I DON'T WANT TO BE LOCKED
INTO THE MOON THING YET.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.192
- YOU GOT TO KEEP THE MOONS.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.793
THAT'S MY FAVORITE PART, STATS.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.230
- SEX IN ZERO GRAVITY,
THAT'S MY FAVORITE PART.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.797
- OH, THINK ABOUT IT, BRO.
SEX IN ZERO GRAVITY WOULD SUCK.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.266
THERE'S NO TORQUE.
THERE'S NO FRICTION.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.234
IT'S ALL ABOUT TORQUE
AND FRICTION.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.714
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD
THAT PHRASE?

01:20.748 --> 01:23.217
BUT THIS TIME,
IT WAS PERSONAL.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.253
JOHNNY, DRIVING AS QUICK
AS HE COULD--

01:25.286 --> 01:26.487

OKAY.

- HEY, UM, T,
CAN WE PICK UP MAEVE REAL QUICK?

02:13.667 --> 02:16.670
- WHY, SHE FINALLY DECIDED
TO TURN HERSELF IN?

02:16.704 --> 02:17.838
- OH, MY GOD,
WHAT'D SHE DO?

02:17.871 --> 02:19.440
- NOTHING, BILLY.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.175
- OH, SHE JUST REALLY NEEDS
A RIDE ACROSS TOWN,

02:27.047 --> 02:28.616
PRIVATE TAXI SERVICE?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.883
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK
WE SHOULD BE DOING?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.352
- NO, BUT COULD YOU TELL HER
THAT?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.886
IT'S NOT THAT I'M FRIGHTENED
OF HER,

02:32.920 --> 02:35.423
IT'S JUST THAT I'M AFRAID OF HER
SOMETIMES.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.692
- LISTEN CLOSE, MAEVE,

02:38.726 --> 02:41.562

03:55.168 --> 03:57.805
EXCEPT FOR THE HUGE FRICKIN'
PYTHON AROUND MY NECK.

BRIAN, CALL ANIMAL CONTROL.

OH, WOW.

THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO

04:17.958 --> 04:18.959
IS GET THAT SNAKE--

04:21.829 --> 04:24.332
OUR COLLEAGUE BRIAN IS CALLING

WHY DON'T YOU HONK THE HORN?
MAYBE THAT'LL SCARE IT OFF.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.176
- WHAT?
YOU WANT ME TO HONK THE HORN?

04:36.209 --> 04:37.611
- YEAH.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.513

A NAME?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.528
- LORD BYRON.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.863
- THAT'S A FANCY NAME
FOR A SNAKE.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.931
- YEAH, IT LOOKS MORE
LIKE A PAUL.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.533
- LISTEN, I DIDN'T NAME IT.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.670
MY PRETENTIOUS DOUCHE BAG
EX-BOYFRIEND DID.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.438
DICKWAD LEFT ME FOR THAT WHORE,
TRISH,

05:04.472 --> 05:06.607
SO I TOOK HIS FAVORITE THING,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.376
A HUGE SNAKE.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.345
IT'S IRONIC,
BECAUSE HIS PENIS IS TINY.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.213
IT'S JUST SO TINY!
- HMM.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.948
- IT'S A TINY PENIS.
- MM-HMM. YEAH.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.184
UM, HOW DID THE SNAKE GET AROUND
YOUR NECK?

05:17.217 --> 05:19.820
- IT MUST HAVE ESCAPED
FROM ITS CAGE IN THE BACKSEAT.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.989
- WE'RE DEALING WITH A HIGHLY
INTELLIGENT SNAKE HERE, GUYS.

05:22.022 --> 05:26.026
- OKAY, I'M GONNA TRY SOMETHING.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.961

[whistles] HUH!

05:31.699 --> 05:33.467
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HUH?

05:33.501 --> 05:34.702
- IT'S NOT A DOG.
IT DOESN'T HAVE EARS, DOES IT?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.136
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T SEE ANY.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.905
- I THINK THEY HEAR
THROUGH VIBRATIONS.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.540
- WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH THAT INFORMATION, BRIAN?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.375
GET A STEP TEAM OUT HERE?
WHERE'S ANIMAL CONTROL?

05:41.409 --> 05:42.743
- THEY SAID THEY WERE SLAMMED.
- DID YOU TELL THEM WE'RE

05:42.776 --> 05:44.478
DEALING WITH A GIANT,
FRICKIN' SNAKE?

05:44.512 --> 05:45.879
- I DID, BUT THE WOMAN ON
THE PHONE KEPT YELLING AT ME

05:45.913 --> 05:47.681
ABOUT BUDGET CUTS,
LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.816
MAYBE SHE WAS GOING THROUGH SOME
OTHER STUFF, I DON'T KNOW.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.317
ANYWAY, I'M NOT SO POSITIVE

05:50.350 --> 05:51.985
THEY'RE GONNA BE OUT HERE
ANYTIME SOON.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.587
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU CUT PUBLIC SERVICES.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.755
- CINDY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CALL YOUR BOYFRIEND.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.756
- EX.
- OKAY, WHATEVER HE IS.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.890
WHERE'S YOUR PHONE?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.091
- IN MY PURSE
IN THE BACKSEAT.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.493
- I GOT IT.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.862
- BE CAREFUL.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.398
- OH, HOLY COW!
AH, I TOUCHED ITS TAIL.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.434
IT FEELS LIKE A GHOST
WENT THROUGH ME.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.169
- OKAY, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
- SCOTT.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.838
- OKAY.
- OH.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
BUT HIS NAME IN MY PHONE
IS SH-- HEAD.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.708
- RIGHT.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.376
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.912
HEY, IS IT--

06:18.946 --> 06:21.014
NO, NO, IT'S NOT CINDY.
I'M AN EMT.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.282
CINDY WAS INVOLVED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT,

06:22.315 --> 06:23.851
BUT SHE'S FINE.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.086
- HE ASK HOW I WAS?
- YEAH, I HAVE YOUR SNAKE.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.788
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
IF ANYBODY'S A PSYCHO,

06:27.821 --> 06:29.757
IT'S THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT
THAT HUGE FRICKIN' THING

06:29.790 --> 06:32.092
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THAT'S NOT A HOUSE PET, BRO.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.927
I DON'T CARE IF YOU BOUGHT IT
WHEN YOU WERE HIGH.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.029
EVERYBODY BUYS SOMETHING WEIRD
WHEN THEY'RE HIGH.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.565
- TELL HIM IF HE GETS BACK
TOGETHER WITH ME,

06:37.598 --> 06:38.532
I'LL GIVE HIM BACK HIS SNAKE.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.767
- CINDY, NO.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.401
HE LEFT YOU FOR
THAT TRAMP TRISH.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.036
HE DOESN'T DESERVE YOU.
- AND HE HAS A TINY PENIS.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.071
- ALL GOOD POINTS.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.239
- SAY IT.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.908
- SAY IT.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.810
- CINDY SAYS THAT IF YOU GET
BACK TOGETHER WITH HER,

06:49.843 --> 06:52.212
SHE WILL GIVE YOU
LORD BYRON BACK.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.714
COOL NAME, BY THE WAY.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.483
RIGHT.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.617
HE SAYS HE'S WITH TRISH NOW,
AND YOU'RE CRAZY.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.251
- WILL YOU TELL HIM HE'S A--

06:58.285 --> 06:59.620
- NO, I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.489
YOU HAVE A SNAKE
WRAPPED AROUND YOUR NECK.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.156
- PRIORITIES, CINDY.
- COME ON, SCOTT.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.825
BE A HUMAN BEING HERE.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.959
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL ME

07:05.993 --> 07:07.060
THAT MIGHT HELP US OUT?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.295
OH, YEAH.
OH, REALLY?

07:08.328 --> 07:09.797
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW YOU, PAL.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.064
HAVE FUN WITH TRISH.
ASSHOLE.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.166
- HE'S SUCH AN ASSHOLE, RIGHT?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.569
[sniffles]

07:15.603 --> 07:17.838
- CINDY, UH, JUST GONNA--

07:17.871 --> 07:19.272
WILL YOU GIVE US A SECOND?

07:19.306 --> 07:20.774
- BE RIGHT HERE.
- OKAY.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.113
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET THAT SNAKE
OFF HER NECK

07:26.146 --> 07:28.982
IF ANIMAL CONTROL
DOESN'T SHOW UP?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.652
- AS WE CONTEMPLATED
WHAT TO DO WITH THE SNAKE,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.954
I COULD SEE THAT HANK
WAS FORMULATING A PLAN.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.623
- PLAN, WHAT PLAN?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.491
- I THOUGHT IF I DICTATED IT,
IT WOULD COME TRUE,

07:37.525 --> 07:39.192
LIKE A "IF YOU BUILD IT,
THEY WILL COME" SCENARIO.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.428
- WHY DON'T YOU MAKE YOURSELF
A HERO OF YOUR OWN STORY

07:41.461 --> 07:42.796
AND GO IN THERE
AND GET THE SNAKE?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.297

07:46.299 --> 07:48.035
- MY NINTH GRADE ENGLISH TEACHER
WAS REALLY HOT.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.137
- BRIAN, GO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANYONE IN THE FIREHOUSE.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.872
IF THEY'RE NAPPING
OR SOME SH--, WAKE THEM UP.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.474
- SEE, THAT'S A PLAN.
THE DICTATION WORKED.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.709
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

07:55.743 --> 07:58.946
I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.

- OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.103
OH, JESUS.
OH, IT RAN RIGHT AT ME!

08:56.136 --> 08:57.905
THE SNAKE RAN RIGHT AT ME.
I JUMPED OVER IT.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.040
- DID YOU SEE WHERE IT WENT?
- IT WAS GOING TOWARDS A RIG.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.675
AH, WHAT IF IT SLIDES
IN THERE

09:01.709 --> 09:03.076
AND TOUCHES MY STUFF?

09:03.110 --> 09:04.277
- EITHER WAY,
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL

09:04.311 --> 09:05.378
WE'RE GOING IN THAT FIREHOUSE.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.546

SITUATION AT THE FIREHOUSE.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.422
WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.691
- IF THAT'S A METAPHOR,
I'M JEALOUS.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.926
- UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.802
- IT STINKS BACK HERE.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
- IT'S NOT A LIMO, MAEVE.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.239
- LOOK, IT'S CRUEL
AND UNUSUAL SMELLING.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.273

BABE?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.775
- YES.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.810
- WELL, I'D OPEN A WINDOW,
BUT I CAN'T.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.079
- IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT
THE CRIMINALS TO GET OUT, MAEVE.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.314
- YOU WERE MEAN AS A CHILD,
AND YOU'RE MEAN NOW.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.483

10:00.033 --> 10:01.935

10:01.969 --> 10:03.804
IT SMELLS LIKE HOBO FARTS

10:03.837 --> 10:04.972
- HEY, REMEMBER,

10:14.782 --> 10:17.150
IF THIS IS A SAMPLE SALE,
I DON'T THINK I LIKE IT.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.485
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
WAIT IN THE CAR.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.653
- NO, WE NEED YOU.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.055

11:44.972 --> 11:46.840
WE JUST GOT A PYTHON

11:46.874 --> 11:48.842
- SERIOUSLY.
THEY SAVE MORE CATS THAN PEOPLE.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.377
WE SAVE MORE PEOPLE IN A MONTH

11:50.410 --> 11:52.012
THAN THEY DO
IN THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.380
- HEY, YOU GUYS NEED ANY HELP

12:11.098 --> 12:13.300
- OH, WHERE YOU GOING?

I CANNOT BE FIRED.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.605
SO I DON'T CARE.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.107

12:29.649 --> 12:31.584
WHY I DON'T WANT
MY LAST THOUGHT TO BE,

12:31.618 --> 12:33.586
AS THAT SNAKE IS STRANGLING ME,

12:33.620 --> 12:37.057
THAT I DID NOT DRIVE MY T-BIRD
TO MY HOUSEBOAT.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.826
- THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY
IN YOUR DEPARTMENT

12:38.859 --> 12:39.893
WHO SPECIALIZES IN SNAKES.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.761

12:50.303 --> 12:52.105
- WAIT, BEFORE WE KILL IT,

12:52.139 --> 12:53.773
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHO'S
REALLY TO BLAME HERE, HUH?

12:53.807 --> 12:56.176
THE SNAKE OR THE PEOPLE?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.911
ACCORDING TO MY GOOGLING,

12:57.945 --> 12:59.847
LORD BYRON SHOULD BE
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA,

12:59.880 --> 13:02.749
HAPPILY SWIMMING IN RIVERS
AND EATING LOCAL MAMMALS.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.651
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT THAT
HE WAS BORN INTO CAPTIVITY

13:04.684 --> 13:06.686
IN WICKER PARK
AND CINDY'S NOT A GOAT.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.355
- THAT'S REALLY NICE.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.257
I'M GONNA GO CHOP IT IN HALF.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.791

THAT'S A GOOD CHOP.
[overlapping chatter]

13:23.503 --> 13:25.105
- WH--
- I PANICKED.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.606
I THREW IT AT HIM.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.707
NOW THE SNAKE HAS AN AX.
WE NEED A GUN.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.009
DOES ANYBODY HAVE A GUN?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.978
- YOU KNOW WHO HAS A GUN.
FRANK.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.046
- NO, I'M NOT CALLING MY DAD
TO BAIL ME OUT.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.848

HE'S COMING OVER.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.884
- OH, GREAT.

OKAY, NEVER MIND.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.636
HI, BABY.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.906
- SO HOW MUCH LONGER YOU THINK
WE'RE JUST GONNA HANG OUT HERE--

13:58.939 --> 14:00.373
- OFFICER!
- YEP.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.209
- THAT LADY STOLE THE SWEATER
I WANTED.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.211
- IT WAS CLEARLY IN MY PILE.
ARREST HER.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.678
- SHE'S LYING.
IT WAS MY PILE.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.047
- LADIES, LADIES--

14:07.080 --> 14:08.348
CALM DOWN FOR A SECOND.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.217
CALM DOWN.
IT'S JUST A SWEATER.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.920
OH, DAMN, IS THIS CASHMERE...

14:12.953 --> 14:16.756
AND PERIWINKLE FOR $20
DOWN FROM $200?

14:16.789 --> 14:18.058
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.893
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD DEAL
FOR CASHMERE.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.996
OKAY--OKAY--T, I'M GONNA NEED
BACKUP OVER HERE.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.032
- BE RIGHT THERE
RIGHT AS SOON AS I TRY THIS ON.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.100
- UM, HEY, LISTEN, LISTEN,

14:27.134 --> 14:28.868
I THINK I GOT A SOLUTION.

14:28.902 --> 14:32.005
WHY DON'T WE JUST CUT THIS
SWEATER IN HALF LIKE A BABY?

14:32.039 --> 14:34.041
YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT DUDE
IN THE BIBLE.

14:34.074 --> 14:38.078
HE CUT THIS BABY IN HALF,
SO THEN BOTH WOMEN HAD A BABY.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.180
WAIT.
THAT'S NOT HOW THAT STORY WENT.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.449
UM, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO?

14:42.482 --> 14:43.951
[all screaming]

14:49.923 --> 14:52.759
[tires screeching]

14:52.792 --> 14:55.929
- ALL RIGHT, THE CAVALRY'S HERE.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.364
YOU FREAKIN' PUSSIES.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.765
WHAT ARE YOU,
AFRAID OF A LITTLE SNAKE?

14:58.798 --> 15:00.600
- HEY, IT'S A PRETTY BIG SNAKE,
DAD.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.402
- IT'S GOT NO ARMS
AND NO LEGS.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.903
I GOT TWO OF EACH.
I'M LIKING MY ODDS.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.638
- OKAY, OKAY, RELAX.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.807
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS YOU THINK
TO CAPTURE A PYTHON.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.276
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S PROBABLY EASIER.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.910
- OKAY.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.878
- IT'S NOT EVEN ONE
OF THOSE POISONOUS SNAKES

15:11.911 --> 15:13.480
LIKE A KING COBRA.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.115
OVER IN INDIA, THEY GOT
LITTLE DUDES PLAYING FLUTES

15:15.148 --> 15:17.050
IN THEIR UNDERWEAR,
TRAPPING THOSE SONS OF BITCHES

15:17.084 --> 15:18.651
IN WICKER BASKETS ALL THE TIME.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.287
- ALL RIGHT, BIG TOUGH GUY.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.455
- AS I WATCHED JOHNNY'S DAD'S
GODLIKE DEMEANOR

15:22.489 --> 15:23.890
IN THE FACE OF DANGER,

15:23.923 --> 15:26.259
I FINALLY SAW WHAT MANHOOD
REALLY WAS.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.827
AND IT MEANT BUSINESS.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.929
- BRIAN, SHUT UP.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.164
- WHAT WAS THAT?
I LIKED IT.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.633
- I'M DICTATING MY MEMOIRS.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.668
- GOOD FOR YOU.
WELL, WATCH AND DICTATE.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.904
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU SOME
KILLER MATERIAL.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.472
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, GET HIM, FRANK.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.640
[cocks gun]

15:41.975 --> 15:44.011
- GO GET HIM, FRANK.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.112
[gunshot]

15:45.145 --> 15:46.946
- HEY.
[laughs] HE GOT HIM.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.947
THAT'S MY DAD.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.016
[gunshots]

15:49.049 --> 15:50.417
NOW HE'S JUST SHOWING OFF.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.119
- DON'T SHOOT THE TV, FRANK.
- YEAH.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.654
[clattering, thudding,
objects smashing]

15:54.687 --> 15:56.456
- [whimpering] OH!
THAT FREAKIN' THING IS HUGE!

15:56.489 --> 15:57.957
[laughter]

15:57.991 --> 16:00.427
JESUS, IT'S FAST!
IS IT FOLLOWING ME?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.362
SHUT UP, YOU DICKLESS JERKS!

16:02.395 --> 16:04.131
AND YOU WITH THE HAIR,

16:04.164 --> 16:06.666
DON'T EVEN THINK OF PUTTING THAT
IN YOUR GODDAMN BOOK.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.568
- WHAT IF I CHANGE YOUR NAME?
- NO!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.306
- BACK OFF, BITCH!

16:13.340 --> 16:15.842
- WHAT?
NO, I'M THE STORE MANAGER.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.311
AND THERE'S A WOMAN
OVER THERE SHOPLIFTING.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.814
- [sighs]

16:21.848 --> 16:23.716
WE GOT A SHOPLIFTER
ON THE MOVE.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.885
SHE'S HEADED TO THE BACK
ENTRANCE.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.721
- I'M TRAPPED, T, I'LL NEVER GET
OVER THERE IN TIME.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.624
- SH--, SHE'S GETTING AWAY.
SHE'S GETTING AWAY.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.993
- NO!
- [yelps]

16:34.027 --> 16:35.595
women: OH!
[murmuring]

16:40.867 --> 16:42.369
- HOLY SH--,
NICE, BABE.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.870
YOU JUST CAUGHT THE PERP.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.305
THAT WAS REALLY ATHLETIC.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.240
YOU JUST LOOKED LIKE A FINE-ASS
J.J. WATT

16:47.274 --> 16:48.508
THE WAY YOU JUST JUMPED AT HER.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.976
- WHAT?
WHAT PERP?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.712
THIS BITCH JUST STOLE
THE DRESS I WANTED.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.414
- OH, OKAY, COME ON.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.782
- OKAY.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.954
- WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.526
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.428
- IT'S ALL OVER THE SQUAWK BOX.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.763
EVERY EMERGENCY SERVICE
IN CHICAGO

17:10.797 --> 17:12.565
IS TALKING ABOUT THIS SH--.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.534
YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF WIMPS.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.336
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.939
BEING BRAVE IS LITERALLY PART
OF YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.841
I AM DISGUSTED.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.278
AND WHERE IS THE ANIMAL CONTROL
GUY?

17:25.312 --> 17:27.580
HAVE YOU NO PRIDE?
- I DO NOT.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.349
- DISGRACEFUL.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.719
LET ME SHOW Y'ALL HOW A REAL MAN
HANDLES HIS BUSINESS.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.355
VOODOO, GO GET HIM.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.723
- YES, SIR.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.025
- AND OFF SHE WENT,
MY SNAKE CHARMER.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.560
- I LIKE THAT.
GOOD USE OF METAPHOR.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.295
WE SHOULD START
A WRITERS' GROUP.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.963
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D LET
A SMALL BLONDE WOMAN

17:43.996 --> 17:46.099
WALK DIRECTLY INTO THE
GATES OF HELL.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.600
- VOODOO,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

17:47.634 --> 17:48.968
- I'VE BEEN IN THERE.
I'VE SEEN IT.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.870
THIS IS NO NORMAL SNAKE.
YOU GOT TO--

17:50.903 --> 17:51.871
- UH, YOU WERE SAYING?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.806
all: OH!

17:53.840 --> 17:54.907
- OKAY.
- THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.576
- WHOO-HOO!
- YOU OKAY?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.145
- NOT TOO CLOSE, NOT TOO CLOSE.
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.479
- THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S A WITCH,
RIGHT?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.248
- YEAH.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.317
- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BRING
THAT INTO THE OFFICE FOR ME?

18:04.351 --> 18:06.819
- OKAY.
- ASK FOR JANET.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.321
- VOO, HOW'D YOU LEARN
TO DO THAT?

18:08.355 --> 18:10.089
- LEARN?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.225
I JUST PICKED UP THE SNAKE
AND STAYED AWAY FROM THE MOUTH.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.993
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.728
PLUS, LOOK HOW CUTE HE IS.
- NO, HE'S NOT THAT CUTE.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.297
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.233
DOES THIS MEAN SCOTT DOESN'T GET
HIS SNAKE BACK?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.401
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.335
PROBABLY NOT.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.970
- PERFECT.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.005
OH, MY GOD, CAN YOU TAKE
A PICTURE OF US?

18:26.038 --> 18:28.575
- NO.
- OKAY.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.243
CAN YOU, KIND SIR?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.978
- MM-HMM.
- THANK YOU.

18:32.011 --> 18:35.114
STEVEN, BUDDY,
GET UP IN THIS,

18:35.148 --> 18:36.883
LIKE, REAL TIGHT.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.253
TAKE THAT, SH-- HEAD.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.054
all: SMILE.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.428
- HEY, THOSE ARE MY CLOTHES.
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.398
NEWS FLASH--YOU HAVE
TO PAY MONEY FOR THINGS.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.701
MAEVE, STOP.
THAT IS EVIDENCE.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.203
- NO, THIS IS YOUR STUFF.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.206
YOU HAVE, LIKE, TERRIBLE TASTE,
THERESA.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.207
- [laughs]
- OH, PLEASE.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.641
I SAW WHAT YOU STOLE.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.276
BESIDES THAT DRESS,
EVERYTHING YOU HAD

19:03.310 --> 19:05.312
LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING
A GRANDMOTHER WOULD DIE IN.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.979
OW.

19:07.013 --> 19:11.117
- WOULD YOU STOP?
I WILL PULL THIS CAR OVER.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.985
- I GOT TO SAY,
I'M NOT HATING THIS.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.654
BABE, I THINK THAT YOU WOULD
REALLY KICK ASS

19:14.687 --> 19:15.688
IN A WOMAN'S PRISON,

19:15.722 --> 19:17.056
AND YOU LOOK GOOD IN ORANGE.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.958
I THINK YOU LOOK GOOD
IN ALL COLORS.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.127
- THANKS, BABY.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.862
- DON'T THINK I WON'T ARREST
YOU, MAEVE.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.996
- BITCH.
- TOTALLY.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.898
- WHAT WAS THAT?
both: NOTHING.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.676
- AW, THAT WAS AWESOME.
I FEEL SO ALIVE.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.845
I FEEL DOUBLE ALIVE BECAUSE
I SAW MY DAD RUN AWAY

19:38.878 --> 19:40.580
FROM THAT SNAKE
LIKE AN OVERGROWN BABY.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.215
- WELL, THE APPLE DIDN'T FALL
TOO FAR FROM THE TREE.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.516
- WHATEVER.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.151
- IT IS A DAY
I WILL NOT SOON FORGET.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.719
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT, BRIAN.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.154
YOU GOT A LOT OF GOOD STUFF
FOR YOUR MEMOIRS.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.689
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU GOT SO FAR?
BUST IT OUT.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.157
- WELL, IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.158
- OH, COME ON.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.093
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.895
TWIST MY ARM,
HERE WE GO.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.397
- AND IT WAS DURING THIS PERIOD

19:57.430 --> 19:59.098
THAT I WAS DEALING
WITH A SMELLY FART ISSUE,

19:59.131 --> 20:02.735
SO I WAS GRATEFUL
THAT I WASN'T HAVING ANY SEX.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.537
- HA HA HA, JOHNNY.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.538
VERY FUNNY.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.874
- AS I BENT OVER TO GET MY BAG,

20:07.907 --> 20:10.243
I HOPED THAT THE GUYS DIDN'T SEE
MY THONG.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.613
HOW SMALL IS TOO SMALL WHEN
IT COMES TO YOUR OWN TESTICLES?

20:13.646 --> 20:14.914
- VERY MATURE.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.016
VERY MATURE, GUYS,
VERY MATURE.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.785
- DON'T STOP.
THIS IS GOOD STUFF. KEEP GOING.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.553
- COME ON, I WANT TO HEAR
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

20:20.587 --> 20:24.524
- THEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ONE
OF THE BEST, MOST UNDERSTANDING

20:24.557 --> 20:26.959
FRIENDS A GIRL COULD HAVE.
- THAT'S SWEET.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.795
- WE THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE IT.
- I LIKE THAT.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.530
- HEY, BRIAN,
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU

20:30.563 --> 20:31.764
A TASTE OF THE BOOK I'M WRITING.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.799
- LET'S HEAR IT.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.634
- "THE LADY ASTRONAUT TREMBLED

20:34.667 --> 20:37.537
"AS THE HUNKY SPACE ALIEN
UNDRESSED HER.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.707
"AS HER EYES PASSED OVER
HIS STRAPPING BODY,

20:40.740 --> 20:44.777
"SHE REALIZED THAT THEIR SPECIES
COULD, INDEED, MIX.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.145
HIS GLISTENING"--
all: NO.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.880
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- NO, THANK YOU.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.882
- THAT'S GOOD.
- THANK YOU, I'M GOOD.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.318
- IT'S BEEN A GOOD DAY,
YOU GUYS.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
- IT WAS A GOOD DAY.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.155
- WE ENCOUNTERED A PYTHON
WITH AN AX, HANK.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.325
- WHAT WAS HIS NAME?
- LORD BYRON.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.059
- WHO NAMES A SNAKE
"LORD BYRON"?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.328
- AN IDIOT.
A HIPSTER.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.729
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

21:02.762 --> 21:02.829
- [laughs]
- THAT'S GOOD, BRIAN.
