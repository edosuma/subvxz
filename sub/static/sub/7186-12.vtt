00:11.112 --> 00:12.277

Yo-ho, let's go!

00:58.993 --> 01:00.225
Ha-har!

01:01.961 --> 01:03.328
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.330 --> 01:05.898
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.634 --> 01:08.634
Great!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.035
To start today's adventure,

01:10.037 --> 01:12.271
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:12.273 --> 01:14.306
Yo-ho ho!

01:14.308 --> 01:17.843
- [all] Yo-ho ho!
- One more time!

01:17.845 --> 01:19.778
Yo-ho ho!

01:23.349 --> 01:26.251
<i>[Jake]</i> Izzy's
Trident Treasure.

01:26.253 --> 01:30.856
Sandy crackers, Izzy.
Your Mermaid City rocks.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.324
It sure does.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.726
[Jake] Marina, Stormy.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.329
A high tide ahoy to
all our pirate friends.

01:37.331 --> 01:42.634
And a special sea smile to
our honorary mer-sister, Izzy.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.937
[giggles]
And to you as well.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.605
Are you here
for a visit?

01:46.607 --> 01:50.209
No. We're here on
official mermaid business.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.277
We need your help
finding a treasure.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.713
Then you've come
to the right place.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.748
We're great
at finding stuff.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.383
Especially treasure.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.052
What are you
looking for?

02:00.054 --> 02:02.888
Neptune's
Golden Trident.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.790
This special mer-treasure

02:04.792 --> 02:07.092
is said to create
bodies of water.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.661
The Trident was hidden
a long time ago

02:09.663 --> 02:11.897
to keep it safe
from thieving pirates.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.666
But the mer-map that shows
where the Trident was hidden

02:14.668 --> 02:17.336
- was lost at sea.
- Until today.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.071
I found it
when I was surfing.

02:19.073 --> 02:22.207
The Trident is supposed to be
on an underwater mountain

02:22.209 --> 02:23.909
in the middle
of a giant lake.

02:23.911 --> 02:27.412
We can't seem to find
this lake or mountain anywhere.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.248
An underwater mountain?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.250
That's called
Mount Mer-suvias.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.019
And I think I know why
you can't find it.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.055
The lake you're looking for
dried up a long time ago.

02:37.057 --> 02:41.126
So today, Mount Mer-suvias
isn't in the middle of a lake.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.862
It's in the middle
of a sandy desert.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.898
Aw, fishsticks.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.400
Only a mermaid can touch
Neptune's Trident.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.303
And we can't swim
through the desert sand.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.372
Now we'll never
get the Trident.

02:53.374 --> 02:57.176
Hmm, sounds like you
need a mermaid with legs.

02:57.178 --> 03:02.748
Honorary mermaid Izzy,
reporting for duty.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.183
Happy clams!

03:04.185 --> 03:06.418
Izzy, you can walk
through the desert sand.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.055
And, as an honorary mermaid
who's true of heart,

03:10.057 --> 03:11.990
she can hold
the Trident.

03:11.992 --> 03:15.427
[both] Mount Mer-suvias,
here we come.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.463
I'm not sure what
those puny pirates

03:18.465 --> 03:20.699
and guppy girls
are up to,

03:20.701 --> 03:23.335
but it looks
like treasure.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.771
Why, Cap'n,
that looks like a picture

03:25.773 --> 03:28.073
of Neptune's Trident.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.242
Neptune's Trident?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.211
Say no more, Smee.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.313
I've got a treasure
to plunder.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.481
Thanks for joining us
on our quest, Izzy.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.450
We'll lead you as far
as the desert,

03:38.452 --> 03:41.019
and then you and your mates
can take it from there.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.956
No worries, Marina.
We love to help.

03:43.958 --> 03:48.827
Say, mateys, want to help us
find Neptune's Trident?

03:50.296 --> 03:52.064
Great!

03:52.066 --> 03:55.167
Remember to keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

03:55.169 --> 03:57.402
Whenever we solve a
Pirate Problem together,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.338
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

03:59.340 --> 04:02.074
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.209
Is everybody ready?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.477
I got my sword.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.979
I got my map.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.414
And I've got
my Pixie Dust.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.884
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.153
But only in emergencies.

04:15.155 --> 04:19.024
Yo-ho, let's go find
Neptune's Trident.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.330
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

04:25.332 --> 04:28.200
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

04:28.202 --> 04:32.371
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:32.373 --> 04:35.374
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:35.376 --> 04:37.542
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:40.146 --> 04:41.913
[Skully] Look alive,
me hearties.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.549
Sandbar Straits,
dead ahead.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.418
I don't like
the looks of that.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.819
Can we go around it?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.454
I wish we could,

04:49.456 --> 04:51.890
but the map says we have
to take Sandbar Straits

04:51.892 --> 04:55.360
to a river that will lead us
to Mount Mer-suvias.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.896
Then keep your
weather-eyes open, crew.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.565
One wrong move and Bucky
could get stuck.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.100
Don't worry, Jake.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.136
Stormy and I will help
guide you through.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.337
Thanks, Marina.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.375
[bell rings]

05:16.082 --> 05:17.316
[bell rings]

05:17.318 --> 05:19.284
[Jake]
Steady as she goes.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.353
Yo-ho, way to go.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.188
We made it through
Sandbar Straits,

05:23.190 --> 05:25.524
and got three
gold doubloons.

05:25.526 --> 05:29.294
Let's grab 'em and go
find Neptune's Trident.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.996
Sneaky snook alert.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.131
Ol' Feather Hat
is on our tail.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.934
[gasps] I bet he wants
to get his hooks

05:35.936 --> 05:37.903
on Neptune's Trident.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.471
Steady on, Mr. Smee.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.540
Steadying, sir.

05:44.310 --> 05:48.213
Captain Hook, these sandbars
are way too dangerous.

05:48.215 --> 05:51.116
Your ship could get stuck.
Turn back.

05:51.118 --> 05:55.087
[gasps] Maybe the sea pups
are right, Cap'n.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.490
The sandbars do look a little
tricky to sail through.

05:58.492 --> 06:02.227
And we don't have any
mermy-maids to help us.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.497
Well, I do know a dogfish
who owes me a favor.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.599
- Maybe he could...
- Enough!

06:07.601 --> 06:09.968
I am a Pirate Captain.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.437
I don't need
meddlesome mermaids,

06:12.439 --> 06:15.374
or dogfishes to help me
sail a ship.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.441
[shouting]

06:17.410 --> 06:19.311
Blast.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.612
Beggin' your pardon, Cap'n,

06:20.614 --> 06:23.248
but how are we supposed
to follow them now,

06:23.250 --> 06:26.051
when our ship's
stuck in the sand?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.420
Rowing, Cap'n.
Rowing.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.890
Bucky would have never
made it up this river.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.492
No worries, Stormy.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.361
A good pirate has a boat
for every kind of water.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.629
Okay, mates.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.532
The sandy desert
is this way.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.335
And that's where we'll
find Mount Mer-suvias.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.270
Look alive, me hearties.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.505
Here comes Hook.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.474
Out of me way,
ya blasted river rats.

06:49.476 --> 06:53.011
Say, this current
is pretty strong.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.447
I hope Jake and
his crew are OK.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.348
Uh-oh.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.383
Where is everybody?

06:58.385 --> 06:59.618
They must need our help.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.619
Come on!

07:00.621 --> 07:02.454
Hang in there, crew.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.289
Faster, Smee, faster.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.325
[panting]

07:07.327 --> 07:09.394
Excuse me.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.430
Why are we
going backwards?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.298
Our paddles
aren't strong enough

07:13.300 --> 07:15.400
to row up
the strong current

07:15.402 --> 07:17.502
of this quickly
flowing stream.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.105
Too bad we're
not mermaids.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.507
Their tails
are much stronger

07:22.509 --> 07:24.242
than our paddles.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.677
Marina, Stormy.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.413
Can you help our boat
go up the flowing stream?

07:28.415 --> 07:30.515
Sure thing, Jake.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.651
Awesome coconuts!

07:32.653 --> 07:34.953
Our boat's going
up the stream,

07:34.955 --> 07:37.456
and we got two
gold doubloons.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.692
Let's grab 'em and go
find Mount Mer-suvias.

07:41.427 --> 07:44.296
What? No fair!

07:44.298 --> 07:48.467
Come on, Smee.
Row. Row. Row!

07:48.469 --> 07:51.169
Rowing.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.206
Shiver me sand dunes.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.274
I can't believe
this dry, sandy desert

07:56.276 --> 07:57.542
used to be a lake.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.245
That waterfall
must have once filled it.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.481
And that mountain
must be...

08:02.483 --> 08:04.349
[Marina]
Mount Mer-suvias.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.486
The last known resting place
of Neptune's Trident.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.488
We can't go any further.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.356
It's up to you
now, Izzy.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.125
[Marina] Remember,
you are an honorary mermaid,

08:14.127 --> 08:16.328
so only you
can hold the Trident.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.130
I won't let you down.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.565
Good luck.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.401
[Izzy] Time to put
my best foot forward.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.605
I don't want to disappoint
my mermaid friends.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.343
Behold. I shall
conquer yon river,

08:31.345 --> 08:34.513
the way sailors have always
conquered the seas.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.716
With sails
and the power of wind.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.519
[shouting]

08:40.521 --> 08:42.187
Aye, that'll do it.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.489
[both shouting]

08:46.392 --> 08:48.793
Shiver me timbers.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.463
It's Neptune's Trident.

08:51.465 --> 08:54.165
It's truly awesome.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.734
I guess we beat
ol' Feather Hat

08:55.736 --> 08:57.636
to the treasure
once again.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.739
Yeah, I wonder whatever
happened to Captain Hook.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.173
[shouting]

09:04.043 --> 09:06.278
Captain Hook.
Are you all right?

09:06.280 --> 09:10.215
Ooh, treasure.
Treasure.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.617
Oh, yep.
He's fine.

09:12.619 --> 09:15.320
Treasure.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.322
Don't be silly,
Captain Hook.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.492
Only a mermaid can hold
Neptune's Trident.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.460
And you're not
a mermaid.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.396
Neither are you.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.631
I'm an honorary mermaid.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.466
Then I suppose
you can call me

09:28.468 --> 09:32.370
an honorary
mermaid-treasure-taker.

09:32.372 --> 09:36.141
[screaming]

09:36.143 --> 09:37.509
Oh, dear!

09:37.511 --> 09:40.645
Let go, Cap'n.
Let it go.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.649
The Trident!

09:44.651 --> 09:46.618
Looks like
an emergency to me.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.787
Pixie Dust away.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.390
Got it.

09:58.564 --> 10:02.367
Woo-hoo. The Trident
turned the sandy desert

10:02.369 --> 10:04.402
back into a watery lake.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.670
Yay-hey.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.639
We saved Neptune's Trident

10:07.641 --> 10:10.508
and got three more
gold doubloons.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.678
Let's grab 'em and go bring
the mermaids their treasure.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.117
As honorary mermaid,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.385
I present to you...

10:20.387 --> 10:21.820
Da-da-da-da!

10:21.822 --> 10:24.289
...Neptune's Trident.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.424
From one mermaid
to another...

10:26.426 --> 10:28.426
- [both] Thanks!
- [giggles]

10:28.428 --> 10:31.396
Anytime.
Glad we could help.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.832
- So long.
- Happy swimming.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.500
Woo-hoo.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.506
Mateys, thanks for helping us
find Neptune's Trident.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.475
Now, let's count
our gold doubloons

10:43.477 --> 10:46.144
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.420
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:55.422 --> 10:57.422
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:57.424 --> 10:59.524
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

10:59.526 --> 11:02.460
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:02.462 --> 11:05.163
C'mon, count with us.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.532
[all] Yeah!

11:08.734 --> 11:11.436
[Jake] One, two, three.

11:11.438 --> 11:12.804
[Cubby] Four, five.

11:12.806 --> 11:16.174
[Izzy] Six, seven, eight.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.544
Yay-hey. For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:19.546 --> 11:21.846
we got eight
gold doubloons.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.216
And we got
something else.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.452
- What is it?
- It's a note,

11:27.454 --> 11:29.554
from Marina and Stormy.

11:29.556 --> 11:33.558
It says, "For our
honorary mermaid, Izzy,

11:33.560 --> 11:36.861
we give you...

11:36.863 --> 11:39.564
...Izzy's Trident".

11:39.566 --> 11:42.500
Crackers.
It works.

11:42.502 --> 11:46.438
[all laugh]

11:46.440 --> 11:48.640
- [coyote howling]
- Are you sure

11:48.642 --> 11:50.208
this is the best way

11:50.210 --> 11:51.943
to get back
to the <i>Jolly Roger?</i>

11:51.945 --> 11:53.478
Trust me, Smee.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.648
This time I've got it
all worked out.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.384
Now, which way is
the wind blowing?

11:59.386 --> 12:03.788
Mmm. I believe
it's blowing due...

12:03.790 --> 12:05.757
Uh. Oh, dear.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.562
[shouting] Smee!

12:15.634 --> 12:17.902
<i>[Jake]</i> Pirate Putt-Putt.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.604
[Izzy] Ahoy, mateys.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.906
I found my puzzle box.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.008
Hey, look what I found.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.410
What are those?

12:25.412 --> 12:28.413
Golf clubs for playing
Pirate Putt-Putt.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.015
That's a game where you hit
a ball with one of these clubs

12:31.017 --> 12:33.651
and try to get it in
a special hole in the ground.

12:33.653 --> 12:37.288
Check it out.
There's a map, too.

12:37.290 --> 12:41.259
Wow. It's got a message
on it from Peter Pan.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.595
He says that he built
a place on Never Land

12:43.597 --> 12:46.331
just for playing
Pirate Putt-Putt.

12:46.333 --> 12:50.468
Say, mateys, want to play
Pirate Putt-Putt with us today?

12:51.537 --> 12:52.871
Great!

12:52.873 --> 12:55.440
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.475
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

12:57.477 --> 12:59.577
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em,

12:59.579 --> 13:01.980
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.716
Yo ho, let's go play
Pirate Putt-Putt.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.422
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

13:11.424 --> 13:13.792
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:13.794 --> 13:15.393
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

13:15.395 --> 13:18.596
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:18.598 --> 13:21.065
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:21.067 --> 13:23.368
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:28.541 --> 13:30.375
Bilge-water!

13:30.377 --> 13:34.345
This blasted bird
beat me. Again.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.347
[chortling]

13:36.349 --> 13:38.349
There, there, Cap'n.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.985
Why don't you spy
on the sea pups?

13:40.987 --> 13:43.421
That always puts you
in a better mood.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.390
You know me so well,
Mr. Smee.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.427
What's this?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.564
What are those pesky
popinjays up to now?

13:54.366 --> 13:57.802
[Cubby] It should be
right through here.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.404
Whoa!

13:59.406 --> 14:02.073
This is the Pirate
Putt-Putt Course.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.342
It's awesome!

14:04.344 --> 14:06.110
Crack-crackers!

14:06.112 --> 14:07.378
Whoo-hoo!

14:07.380 --> 14:09.080
This is gonna be fun.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.083
Ahoy there.
Puny Popinjays.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.551
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.454
It sure is funny how we
keep running into you.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.122
Yes, well...

14:18.124 --> 14:21.092
...I demand a chance
to defeat you

14:21.094 --> 14:24.495
in a game of wooden
clubs and holes.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.631
Me against
the three of you.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.434
Are you sure you only
want to be a team of one?

14:29.436 --> 14:30.869
Absolutely.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.404
Captain Hook
needs no one's help.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.873
OK, Captain.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.407
The way the game works

14:36.409 --> 14:38.877
is you get one point
for each hole.

14:38.879 --> 14:42.413
Fine.
Let's get started.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.382
This is it, Mr. Smee.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.386
My chance to finally
be a winner.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.088
A winner indeed, Cap'n.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.456
[chuckles]

14:51.458 --> 14:53.892
OK, Cubby.
To make this hole,

14:53.894 --> 14:56.461
putt-putt the ball through
the jaws of the croc.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.129
Aw, coconuts.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.098
This looks pretty tricky.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.634
Don't worry.
Just take your time.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.470
Concentrate on where
you want the ball to go.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.872
Aim, and then
hit the ball.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.173
Got it, Jake.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.808
Take your time.

15:10.810 --> 15:12.911
Concentrate.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.546
Aim, and then
hit the ball.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.018
[Skully] Woo-hoo!

15:20.020 --> 15:22.086
You got the ball
in the hole,

15:22.088 --> 15:23.688
and you got one point.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.924
And I got three
gold doubloons.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.494
Let's grab 'em and go play
some more Pirate Putt-Putt.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.163
Stand back, everybody,

15:32.165 --> 15:34.832
and watch a winner.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.068
Remember, Captain,
take your time...

15:37.070 --> 15:38.169
Captain Hook
needs no advice

15:38.171 --> 15:41.639
from a pint-sized putter.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.876
Over there.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.844
- [ball ricocheting]
- Crackers.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.212
[grunts]

15:48.214 --> 15:50.815
- [thudding]
- [shouting]

15:50.817 --> 15:54.152
Release me,
you mechanical menace!

15:54.154 --> 15:58.690
[Hook] Well, well,
a little Shipwreck Cove.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.124
Now that I'm warmed up,

16:00.126 --> 16:03.594
I need a real challenge
like this.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.829
To win a point,

16:04.831 --> 16:07.131
you have to hit the ball
past the shipwrecks,

16:07.133 --> 16:08.766
through the lighthouse door

16:08.768 --> 16:11.102
so it drops into the hole
that's inside.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.872
Hmm, I think I see
a way of doing this.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.775
Just like Jake said,
take your time,

16:17.777 --> 16:19.577
concentrate,

16:19.579 --> 16:22.547
aim, and then
hit the ball.

16:26.052 --> 16:30.788
You got one point for
putting the ball in the hole.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.124
That gives Jake's crew
two points.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.860
And I got two more
gold doubloons.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.097
Let's grab 'em and go
play more Putt-Putt.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.799
Perhaps you should
follow Jake's advice.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.101
Take your time...

16:43.103 --> 16:45.203
Balderdash and piffle.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.906
This is the time
to strike, and win!

16:50.275 --> 16:52.710
Tally-ho.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.079
Tallying, sir.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.615
<i>¶ Duck your head</i>
<i>Watch your rudder ¶</i>

16:57.617 --> 16:59.650
<i>¶ Maybe I'll tell you</i>
<i>what's-what ¶</i>

16:59.652 --> 17:01.652
<i>¶ Captain Hook is</i>
<i>swingin' a putter ¶</i>

17:01.654 --> 17:03.721
<i>¶ But he don't know</i>
<i>how to putt-putt ¶</i>

17:03.723 --> 17:06.024
<i>¶ Duck your head</i>
<i>Watch your rudder ¶</i>

17:06.026 --> 17:08.092
<i>¶ Maybe I'll tell you</i>
<i>whats-what ¶</i>

17:08.094 --> 17:10.028
<i>¶ Captain Hook is</i>
<i>swingin' a putter ¶</i>

17:10.030 --> 17:12.130
<i>¶ But he don't know</i>
<i>how to putt-putt ¶</i>

17:12.132 --> 17:13.931
¶ He don't know
how to putt-putt ¶

17:13.933 --> 17:15.833
Look out.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.703
- [grunts]
- Whoa!

17:20.806 --> 17:24.208
And Cap'n Hook
gets no points.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.278
[Cubby] This Belch Mountain
might be little,

17:27.280 --> 17:30.014
but it sure looks
hot-hot-hot.

17:30.016 --> 17:33.017
That's why the ball has to
go over the volcano,

17:33.019 --> 17:35.887
and between the spurts
of steam. Watch me.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.221
Take your time.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.158
Concentrate on where
you want the ball to go.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.194
Aim, and hit the ball.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.136
You got the hole,

17:52.138 --> 17:55.573
and that gives our team
a total of three points.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.175
Oh, dear.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.611
This hole looks even more
difficult than the last one.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.647
What are you
going to do, Cap'n?

18:02.649 --> 18:06.317
Take this coconut
and plug up that volcano.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.219
Aye, Cap'n.
Plug up that...

18:08.221 --> 18:09.921
Oh, my.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.091
Careful, Cap'n.
Belch Mountain is tricky.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.126
Don't you worry
about me, lad.

18:15.128 --> 18:19.297
[gasps] Is that
a flying dragon?

18:22.801 --> 18:24.836
- A dragon?
- Where?

18:24.838 --> 18:27.371
Onward to victory.

18:32.878 --> 18:35.613
Blast this infernal shaking.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.816
It's keeping me perfect putt
from falling into the hole.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.086
It might be the volcano's
fault, Cap'n.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.889
I think the coconut is
trapping the steam inside,

18:44.891 --> 18:46.624
and it has nowhere to go.

18:46.626 --> 18:50.194
Hook put a coconut
in the volcano?

18:50.196 --> 18:51.629
Aw, coconuts!

18:51.631 --> 18:54.899
Step aside.
I shall get it out.

18:54.901 --> 18:58.669
Blow me down.
She's gonna blow.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.872
[screaming]

19:00.874 --> 19:04.242
Izzy.
This is an emergency.

19:04.244 --> 19:08.045
Then it's...
Pixie Dust away!

19:08.047 --> 19:12.150
Somebody stop
this kooky coconut!

19:12.152 --> 19:15.319
Blast.
[shouting]

19:15.321 --> 19:16.754
[both] Gotcha.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.922
Way to go.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.190
We saved Captain Hook,

19:19.192 --> 19:21.893
and got five more
gold doubloons.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.327
Let's grab 'em and go.

19:25.297 --> 19:29.133
Oh, Cap'n. I'm so glad
you're all right.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.302
Thank you, sea pups.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.438
Never mind that, Smee.
Did I make a point?

19:34.440 --> 19:38.209
Oh, my. In all
the excitement, I...

19:38.211 --> 19:42.413
[Hook] Thunder
and lightning. No!

19:42.415 --> 19:46.017
Sorry, but no points
for Hook.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.718
Blast!

19:47.720 --> 19:50.788
Everybody got a point
but me.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.057
I lose again.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.458
Don't be sad, Captain.

19:54.460 --> 19:58.229
The last Pirate Putt-Putt hole
is the trickiest yet.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.431
It's worth four points.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.133
If you get your ball
in the hole,

20:02.135 --> 20:03.968
you could still
win the game.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.204
Really?

20:06.206 --> 20:11.175
Welcome to the Pirate
Putt-Putt Tiki Surprise.

20:11.177 --> 20:14.078
As team captain,
I'll play this hole.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.046
- You can do it, Jake.
- Yeah.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.347
Make that putt.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.750
Take your time.
Concentrate.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.253
Aim, then hit the ball.

20:26.858 --> 20:30.328
Uh-oh. I missed.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.330
This is it, Cap'n.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.199
It's your final chance
to win.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.335
Oh, what's the point?

20:37.337 --> 20:39.337
I never win.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.772
Oh, you can do it, sir.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.242
Mama Hook did not
raise a quitter.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.077
You are Captain Hook.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.146
You were born
to be a winner!

20:49.148 --> 20:51.816
You're right.
I can do it.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.818
I can still win.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.321
Take your time.
Concentrate.

20:57.323 --> 21:06.464
Aim, then hit the ball.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.366
- [Cubby] Whoa.
- [Skully] I can't look.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.433
[gasps]

21:11.303 --> 21:13.504
- I did it!
- Cap'n Hook makes the shot

21:13.506 --> 21:15.239
and gets four points.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.109
Jake's team made three points,
which means...

21:18.111 --> 21:20.544
Great Galleons.
I won!

21:20.546 --> 21:25.082
[laughs]
Hippity-hip hooray, Cap'n.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.851
I finally won.

21:26.853 --> 21:30.054
And you did it by
following Jake's advice.

21:30.056 --> 21:33.391
Mmm, perhaps the lad
might have helped a smidgen.

21:33.393 --> 21:38.362
But what matters is that
I am finally a winner.

21:40.932 --> 21:44.035
Thanks for playing Pirate
Putt-Putt with us, mateys.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.103
Now, let's put all
our gold doubloons

21:46.105 --> 21:48.272
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.581
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:57.583 --> 21:59.550
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:59.552 --> 22:01.886
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

22:01.888 --> 22:04.822
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:04.824 --> 22:07.124
Come on.
Count with us.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.493
[all] Yeah!

22:11.129 --> 22:13.230

22:13.232 --> 22:15.366
[Izzy] Four, five.

22:15.368 --> 22:19.870
[Jake] Six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.973
Yo-ho. For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:22.975 --> 22:26.344
we got ten
gold doubloons.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.113
And we learned
how to putt-putt.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.050
[grumbling]

22:33.052 --> 22:35.252
Oops.
Sorry, Crabby.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.887
[giggling]

22:38.290 --> 22:39.256
[pounding]

22:39.258 --> 22:41.459
What is all that racket?

22:41.461 --> 22:44.328
Oh, Sharky and Bones
are below deck

22:44.330 --> 22:47.064
making a Pirate
Putt-Putt course.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.868
Oh, joy.
I love winning that game.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.305
And what's that drilling?

22:54.307 --> 22:57.475
They're drilling holes
for the Putt-Putt course.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.378
[Hook] In the bottom
of the ship?

23:02.414 --> 23:04.482
Sorry, Cap'n!

23:07.085 --> 23:09.220
<i>¶ What's more sneaky</i>
<i>than the snook? ¶</i>

23:09.222 --> 23:13.057
<i>¶ It's a cabinet full of</i>
<i>all his hooks ¶</i>

23:13.059 --> 23:16.360
<i>¶ Every one in his supply </i>

23:16.362 --> 23:19.263
<i>¶ Is a clever hook</i>
<i>in Hook's surprise ¶</i>

23:19.265 --> 23:21.399
<i>¶ Got a blender hook</i>
<i>and a fishing rod ¶</i>

23:21.401 --> 23:23.200
<i>¶ Got a pinwheel hook</i>
<i>if you think that's odd ¶</i>

23:23.202 --> 23:25.069
<i>¶ Got a butterfly net,</i>
<i>flyswatter too ¶</i>

23:25.071 --> 23:27.505
<i>¶ He can catch a bug</i>
<i>and squish it, ew! ¶</i>

23:27.507 --> 23:29.640
<i>¶ Got a shovel hook</i>
<i>that digs things up ¶</i>

23:29.642 --> 23:31.475
<i>¶ Got a hammer and spoon</i>
<i>Don't mix those up ¶</i>

23:31.477 --> 23:34.178
<i>¶ Got a whirly hook</i>
<i>so he can fly ¶</i>

23:34.180 --> 23:36.414
<i>¶ And an eggbeater hook</i>
<i>I don't know why ¶</i>

23:36.416 --> 23:37.982
<i>¶ Captain Hook </i>

23:37.984 --> 23:40.050
<i>¶ Oh, what a frumpy,</i>
<i>grumpy goosey ¶</i>

23:40.052 --> 23:43.220
<i>¶ He never learned to share </i>

23:43.222 --> 23:45.189
<i>¶ Captain Hook </i>

23:45.191 --> 23:47.191
<i>¶ A stinky, finky</i>
<i>double-crosser ¶</i>

23:47.193 --> 23:49.026
<i>¶ Mateys best </i>

23:49.028 --> 23:50.628
<i>¶ Mateys best beware </i>

23:50.630 --> 23:54.064
<i>¶ He's after you</i>
<i>so take a look ¶</i>

23:54.066 --> 23:56.600
<i>¶ He's the dastardly</i>
<i>Captain Hook ¶</i>

23:56.602 --> 23:59.103
<i>¶ Captain Hook </i>

23:59.105 --> 24:01.272
<i>¶ A stinky, finky</i>
<i>double-crosser ¶</i>

24:01.274 --> 24:03.174
<i>¶ Mateys best </i>

24:03.176 --> 24:04.575
<i>¶ Mateys best beware </i>
