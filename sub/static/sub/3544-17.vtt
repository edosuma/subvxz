Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.280 --> 00:06.442
How is our precious anchor
to the Other Side?

00:06.600 --> 00:09.365
I'm letting her think
she's teaching me magic. It's kind of cute.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.444
- Who the hell are you?
- I get people to do things they don't wanna do.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.364
- I killed Aaron Whitmore.
- You did not kill Aaron Whitmore.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.842
I did. I thought you broke my heart,
so I ripped open Aaron's neck.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.441
That is how much control you have over me.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.803
And I'm still here.
That's how much control you have over me.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.843
- This has to end.
- It just did.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.040
The leader of the Travelers
wants the blood from you and Elena.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.282
Until the last doppelganger
is out of the picture...

00:38.440 --> 00:42.126
- ...your blood doesn't do squat.
- We need the doppelganger dead.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.327
He's in Atlanta.

00:48.120 --> 00:52.091
Got a good grip. What's your name, huh?
My name is Tom.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.645
You're gonna be all right.

00:53.840 --> 00:56.491
- Ugh!
- His name is Tom Avery. I heard that much.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.643
- Pneumothorax. I need a 10-gauge needle now.
- We'll take it from here.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.485
If you don't do it now,
she won't make it to the table.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.487
Come on, Stefan.
I need your help with the link.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.570
Tell me what you see.
Tell me where to find your doppelganger.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.486
You're a piece of work, Avery. They must
have broke the mold when they made you.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.568
Atlanta Metropolitan Hospital.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.681
Good.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.440
Now your friends can go kill him.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.643
Morning, sunshine.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.725
Oh. Um...

02:13.040 --> 02:15.327
Did I wake you?

02:15.480 --> 02:17.244
No, I've been up for three hours.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.571
Really? Because you didn't say a word.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.209
Neither did you.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.330
Mm. Well, ahem...

02:26.480 --> 02:29.245
that's because
I didn't really have much to say.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.210
Nothing's changed.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.331
We're still bad for each other,
and we are still broken up.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.128
Last night was...

02:39.280 --> 02:40.964
a mistake.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.168
Maybe we should keep making mistakes.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.762
Big ones.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.922
Oh.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.530
Seriously, Damon, put some clothes on.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.765
- Or at least get out of my way. I need to go.
- Your loss.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.042
I make one hell of a naked breakfast.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.608
Atlanta Assassination Squad.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.807
How may we be of service?

03:40.960 --> 03:43.804
I take it you haven't located
the doppelganger yet?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.721
You told us to find a nameless
paramedic at the scene of a car accident...

03:47.880 --> 03:51.566
in a city full of freeways,
fried green tomatoes...

03:51.720 --> 03:55.008
and terrible drivers.
It's not exactly as easy as it sounds.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.687
Which is why I'm calling.
The doppelgangers name is Tom Avery.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.129
And I just saw him deliver a patient
to Atlanta Metro Hospital.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.204
She saw him?
She did the vision thing again?

04:05.400 --> 04:08.802
We had a deal.
I find Stefan's last living doppelganger...

04:08.960 --> 04:10.803
- Tom.
- ...Tom.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.845
I take care of Tom...

04:14.000 --> 04:18.005
and in return, you stop using Stefan
to psychically doppel-bomb him.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.726
Every time you link them,
you're frying Stefan's brain.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.844
I don't give a damn about his brain.
It's his blood that matters.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.010
Until Stefan and Elena
are the last two doppelgangers on Earth...

04:27.200 --> 04:28.645
their blood is useless.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.771
You better believe I will give Stefan a
back-alley lobotomy if you fail to kill Tom.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.367
Well, I don't fail at things.
So do it again and I'll kill you too.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.611
"I'll kill you too."

04:41.440 --> 04:44.125
Like a perky blond angel of death.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.606
Almost had me convinced.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.801
Hey, hey, baby, don't you know?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.160
<i>Can you feel that heat...?</i>

04:52.320 --> 04:55.369
- Breakfast of champions.
- Let me guess, this is about Elena.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.769
You know, that is so incredibly insightful,
Donovan.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.407
You are really street smart
from working behind that bar for...

05:02.560 --> 05:05.450
What is it?... three years now.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.563
At least he's not looking for answers
at the bottom of a glass.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.448
Tyler Lockwood is now a life coach despite
running his own life into the ground. Perfect.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.409
You want advice, why not talk to Stefan?

05:14.560 --> 05:19.566
It's difficult to explain to your brother that you
just broke up with the former love of his life.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.321
- And then broke the bed.
- Whoa..

05:23.480 --> 05:26.245
- Heh.
- Besides, I've got you two idiots.

05:27.200 --> 05:31.922
- Mystic Falls' amateur therapists.
- I'm only listening because I'm getting paid.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.609
Less and less by the second.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.128
Anyway, Stefan's not an option.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.529
He's off doing some research project
with Caroline.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.644
Don't worry, wolf boy.
I'm sure they're just friends.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.923
<i>Everybody I see
When I sing to the world</i>

05:48.080 --> 05:50.242
Bottle of gin. Let me
see you break the seal.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.528
What can I say? I got issues.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.490
Whoa. Pull up a chair.
Tell the professionals your problems.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.409
Just talk slow and use small words.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.167
Thanks, but never. Ever. Goodbye.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.842
<i>No other way to choose it
It's how I know that I'm alive</i>

06:06.040 --> 06:07.451
Mm.

06:09.680 --> 06:15.005
Well, boys, I hate to cut the session short, but
unlike you, I have other places to be today.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.288
But don't worry, I will be back.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.643
Because I have some deep,
dark childhood trauma...

06:20.800 --> 06:23.121
that I'm just itching to talk about.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.560
Hmm.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.481
Hmm.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.289
As the guidance counselor,
you'll first meet with me individually...

06:42.440 --> 06:44.602
then you'll have an open house
with the teachers.

06:44.760 --> 06:45.841
Hey, Bon.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.164
- I got your text. What's the friend emergency?
- Damon and I broke up.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.522
- It's final.
- Oh, my God. When did it happen?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.688
<i>- Last</i> night.
- You didn't come home.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.525
- Uh, that's because I slept with him.
- Oh.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.011
- Post-breakup.
- Oh.

06:59.160 --> 07:01.288
- Was that irresponsible?
- Probably.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.281
Does Jeremy know that you and Damon
definitely maybe broke up?

07:05.840 --> 07:08.889
No. He wasn't at the house last night,
thankfully.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.361
Well, that's weird.

07:10.520 --> 07:14.969
I mean, he didn't mention anything to me.
If he wasn't at home, where was he?

07:16.120 --> 07:18.646
I don't know.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.045
That doesn't help
with the irresponsible thing, does it?

07:28.680 --> 07:29.886
Bonnie?

07:30.400 --> 07:34.041
Uh, sorry.
Katherine's cute BFF just showed up.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.170
<i>- I think his name is Luke.</i>
- I have <i>an idea.</i>

07:37.320 --> 07:40.608
- Since you and Damon are officially over...
<i>- Nice</i> try...

07:40.760 --> 07:43.923
but, um, I'm pretty sure
Damon is more of his type.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.167
They'd be cute too.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.450
Heh. Oh, look, Bonnie, I have to go.
Thanks for listening.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.846
Hey, Mrs. Douglas.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.843
- Elena. It's good to see you.
- You too.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.049
Although you're not on the list
as Jeremy's primary contact.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.248
- Then who is?
- Damon Salvatore.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.925
Present.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.922
Mm. Pardon me.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.400
Thanks.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.327
So the receptionist
doesn't know Tom personally...

08:14.480 --> 08:17.404
but I compelled her
to call someone who does.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.288
Okay, I give up. I can't tell if
you're avoiding the mission or me.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.211
- Why can't it be both?
- Because I've earned some company...

08:38.360 --> 08:42.649
after hand-delivering the antidote that kept
Damon and Elena from consuming each other.

08:42.840 --> 08:46.287
It doesn't mean I trust you. I still
don't understand why you're even here.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.602
Damon's trying to be a good boy these days.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.127
Which means I'm in need
of a new murder buddy.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.482
I'm joking. A joke. British humor.

09:02.840 --> 09:06.765
Ah, modern women. All bosom, no mystery.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.680
Present company excluded.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.691
Please don't tell me
that I'm the reason you're here.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.645
Why not? From what Damon tells me,
I am your type.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.683
Well traveled, charming accent,
dodgy morals.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.325
Arrogant, tactless...

09:20.480 --> 09:23.643
- ...completely unable to take a hint.
- Precisely.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.043
Now, to be honest,
you remind me of someone I once knew.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.322
- Hmm?
- She worked for the Augustines.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.329
Which means she tortured you.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.646
I can relate to that.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.481
Maggie was there to observe my behavior
in captivity. Quite liked her, actually.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.685
Let me guess.
She made you want to be a better man.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.440
Not at all.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.690
She just reminded me
that I was good all along.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.681
- You were asking about Tom Avery?
- Yes. We need to see him as soon as possible.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.003
- It's, um, a matter of life and death.
- I wish I could help.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.363
He was a pain in my ass
but also the best paramedic I ever met.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.370
- What do you mean, "was"?
- He disappeared four months ago.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.528
No one knows where he is.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.966
We moved.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.121
Why?

10:24.680 --> 10:27.001
They don't call us Travelers
for our mileage points.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.567
I know this place.
We're outside of Mystic Falls.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.685
I'd rather be at the beach now, but this is
where we're supposed to meet our leader.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.006
Markos, right?

10:38.040 --> 10:39.963
You said he wants our blood. Why?

10:45.240 --> 10:47.720
I hope you're calling to tell me
the doppelgangers dead.

10:47.920 --> 10:51.367
Your doppel-visions gave us bad information.
Put Stefan on the phone.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.242
- Caroline, what happened?
- Tom's been missing for months.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.767
Is there any other things
you noticed in your visions?

11:00.920 --> 11:03.048
<i>Any small details that could
maybe help us out?</i>

11:04.520 --> 11:07.251
No, I can't remember anything.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.046
After the spell happened,
it's like I blacked out.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.202
The link connects us
to the doppelgangers mind.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.244
If we're seeing old memories,
that means we have to go deeper.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.768
No. If he's blacking out, that means
the link is destroying his memories.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.487
Stefan? Stefan.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.724
Stefan. Are you still with me?

11:30.880 --> 11:34.930
Stefan, I'm still here, okay? Listen to my voice.
I'm with you. Can you hear me?

11:36.280 --> 11:38.931
I'm right here, okay? So hold on.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.121
- Excuse me?
- Hi.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.129
- Are you Tom Avery?
- One and only.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.045
- What can I do for you, Miss, uh...?
- Hazel.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.567
And you already did it, actually.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.566
It's my friend Trish. The doctor
said you saved her life last night.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.884
I was just doing my job.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.244
Can I buy you dinner? To thank you, I mean.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.770
Oh, God, I'm so bad at this.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.801
How's 7:00?

12:17.760 --> 12:18.886
Perfect.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.125
You can pick me up at 6643 Peachtree Drive.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.609
Hopefully not in an ambulance.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.043
Can you hear me?

12:30.680 --> 12:32.523
Just say something, please.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.284
Caroline.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.084
- I'm here.
- Okay.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.687
6643 Peachtree Drive.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.088
It was a red-haired woman named Hazel.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.886
Okay, thank you. I won't let you down.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.726
Caroline, he's a good person. Don't do it.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.163
Clock's ticking.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.486
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Clock's busted.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.047
What am I paying my PTA dues for?

13:06.240 --> 13:08.481
- I am gonna file a complaint.
- Is that why you're here?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.921
You left me in charge of Jeremy
when you went to Whitmore.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.289
- This was on my calendar for months.
- Really?

13:14.480 --> 13:17.927
- So no other reason.
- Why? Something else you want to talk about?

13:20.360 --> 13:23.648
Oh, come on. Don't pretend
you're not still tingly from this morning.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.810
Can we just focus on Jeremy?

13:25.960 --> 13:28.167
Right, okay.
Well, speaking of hypotheticals...

13:28.320 --> 13:32.325
if Jeremy was running around with another
girl, would you want to know about it?

13:32.480 --> 13:35.450
- What are you talking about?
- Bonnie's witch trainee, Liv.

13:35.600 --> 13:40.367
I saw her and Jeremy sharing a top-shelf bottle
of inhibition killer at the Grill this morning.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.485
- Jeremy wouldn't do that to Bonnie.
- He once had an affair with a ghost.

13:44.640 --> 13:49.043
And the only thing that was missing
was a sappy love song and a pottery wheel.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.290
He learned his lesson.
Jeremy's not a cheater.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.245
Okay, sorry to keep you waiting.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.168
Bad news first.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.888
Jeremy has missed 11 days of school.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.645
He started three fights...

14:03.800 --> 14:06.371
and he's been caught cheating
in math class...

14:06.520 --> 14:08.124
- ...twice.
- Cheating?

14:10.200 --> 14:11.884
That is so not like him.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.001
Go on, please.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.845
I'm sorry, you are Elena's...?

14:16.040 --> 14:19.169
- Ex-boyfriend. Ex, right?
- Can we not talk about this right now?

14:19.320 --> 14:23.564
Actually, it's relevant. Most problems in
school are rooted in problems at home.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.764
Jeremy's in desperate need
of a stable living situation.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.329
People who care about giving him that
more than their own needs...

14:30.480 --> 14:33.131
Sounds like he's in desperate need
of a less judgy counselor.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.802
We do care. We really do. We'll...

14:38.240 --> 14:39.446
We'll do better.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.081
I hope so. For Jeremy's sake.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.209
It's a miracle we found the place.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.325
Every other street in this blasted city
is Peachtree.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.767
These look old.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.441
Like four months old.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.405
Seventy years in a cage.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.927
You'd think I'd have learned
to pick a lock by now.

15:13.520 --> 15:17.206
Red hair. That's her. She's a witch.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.126
And she must own the house.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.441
Not for long.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.046
Why did you do that?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.282
- She was our only lead.
- Exactly.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.209
And I am a murderous vampire.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.601
Surprise.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.042
<i>Hey-</i>

15:49.680 --> 15:52.729
- Hey. Can I help you?
- Oh, huh?

15:52.880 --> 15:55.326
You keep looking over.
I thought you wanted to say something.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.602
Oh, no. No, I'm just studying.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.843
Unless you're an expert in wave mechanics.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.004
- Hmm. Science isn't really my thing.
- Yeah. Heh.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.171
You're the anchor.

16:06.360 --> 16:09.364
If I'm here, that means I'm dead.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.607
Tell him I failed.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.601
Tell him I was trying to hide the
doppelganger with magic, but they found us.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.331
What are you talking about? Who are you?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.801
Hazel. He'll know the rest.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.529
- Whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?
- She said she knew you.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.603
- How did she know you?
- Who?

16:34.800 --> 16:35.847
Someone named Hazel.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.205
She had a message for you.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.527
What the hell is a silencing spell?

16:44.680 --> 16:48.844
Just a little bit of magic.
Keeps nosy hybrid types from snooping.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.410
So, what's up with those two?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.682
Cliffs Notes, Liv goes to Whitmore.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.650
She's a new witch,
and Bonnie's teaching her magic.

16:57.800 --> 17:02.362
You left out the part about her being hot.
Like weird hot.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.122
You're the one with the vamp ears.
What are they talking about?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.685
- I have no idea. I can't hear anything.
- Huh.

17:12.920 --> 17:17.209
You're here because you're a hunter.
You can't be mind-controlled by Travelers.

17:17.359 --> 17:21.251
That officially makes you the only person
in this room that I can trust.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.602
Okay. So trust me. Tell me what's going on.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.366
There's a rumor going around
in witch circles.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.403
The Travelers are up to something big.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.561
I thought Travelers were witches.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.327
Not quite.
They're more like the ugly stepsister.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.888
Travelers have a grudge against anyone
that draws their magic from nature.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.771
Something about witches cursing the land
to turn it against them.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.481
Now they're on the move. Next stop, here.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.608
Mystic Falls? Why?

17:49.160 --> 17:54.485
Your sister. Turns out Elena's friends are right.
The world actually does revolve around her.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.928
So if you want to keep her safe...

17:57.480 --> 18:00.324
help me figure out
what the Travelers are up to.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.444
Is everything okay?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.889
It Will be.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.408
Wait. You lay this on me,
and now you're leaving?

18:14.600 --> 18:17.001
You were plan A. Plans change.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.006
It's rude to leave Jeremy hanging.
Even for a newbie witch.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.163
Not a newbie witch, FYI.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.850
Just because Jeremy's a bad student,
doesn't mean he's cheating on Bonnie.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.765
You're making excuses for someone you love.
It's what you do.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.922
The worse the behavior,
the more you defend.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.809
You keep trying to make this about us.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.924
Yeah, because you keep trying
to make it about anything else.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.730
You know what? Fine.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.568
But don't pretend you came here for Jeremy.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.722
If you wanna talk about last night, talk.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.049
Here's the thing, Elena.
I don't know what to say.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.481
Or do or think.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.210
All I know...

19:07.760 --> 19:09.250
is that right now...

19:10.240 --> 19:12.447
I wanna rip your clothes
off in this hall...

19:13.080 --> 19:16.084
throw you in one of these classrooms
and kiss every inch of your body...

19:16.240 --> 19:18.766
while a bunch of people
that drive minivans listen...

19:18.920 --> 19:20.922
wishing they were us.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.084
That's probably a bad idea, right?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.770
Right.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.241
Right.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.648
See you in class.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.008
She was in a bloody trance.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.806
Unable to answer questions.
I don't see why you're mad.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.129
I'm only doing what's necessary
to save your friend because you won't.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.611
You don't think I'm up for this?

19:58.800 --> 20:01.371
"This" being the cold-blooded murder
of an innocent man.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.602
You can't say the word.
How do you expect to do it?

20:03.800 --> 20:05.882
I'm sorry. Is this all supposed to be easy?

20:06.040 --> 20:08.691
You barely know me,
so let me reintroduce myself.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.640
Hi, my name is Caroline Forbes,
and I am a good vampire...

20:12.800 --> 20:14.962
and I don't just go
around killing people.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.006
You've got me all wrong, Caroline Forbes.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.011
I'm not judging you, I'm preparing you.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.002
I've seen soldiers, men trained to kill,
look their enemy in the eye...

20:25.240 --> 20:27.049
and freeze up on the battlefield.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.767
A hesitation that usually costs them
their lives.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.845
Last time I checked, this isn't war,
and I'm not a soldier.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.884
But Stefan is one of the best people
that I know.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.089
And when it comes to saving his life, yes,
I will do just about anything...

20:42.760 --> 20:44.683
What's that sound?

20:48.120 --> 20:50.407
The telltale heart.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.643
Why would a witch go to such lengths to keep a
man alive and off the grid for four months?

21:15.400 --> 21:18.131
Four months ago, Silas died.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.886
The original Stefan-ganger.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.849
Well, he's a dead ringer, all right...

21:23.240 --> 21:24.890
or rather, soon to be dead.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.207
Tom?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.081
Tom?

21:35.320 --> 21:38.449
- Tom Avery?
- Caroline, let me do this.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.600
- Walk away now, go upstairs...
- No.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.763
I'm the one who made the deal.
This is on me, no matter what.

21:43.920 --> 21:48.084
Maybe you can't stand the thought of putting
Stefan's life in anyone's hands but your own.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.128
What's happening? Who are you people?

22:13.280 --> 22:15.760
We're angels,
come to deliver you to the sweet hereafter.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.161
Calm down. You can trust me.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.563
- Bonding with him will make it harder on you.
- Let me do this my way.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.525
I'm your friend.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.284
And you mean the world to me.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.841
Do you trust me?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.005
Of course.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.530
Good.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.451
Now, I promise...

22:33.600 --> 22:35.284
you won't feel a thing.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.921
- What's going on?
- I'm getting you out of here.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.842
So you're Liv's twin brother and a witch.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.804
Anything else I should know?

22:52.960 --> 22:57.204
Look, please don't be mad at Liv, okay?
My family's kind of messed up.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.331
I'm not mad. I'm creeped out.
Why have you been watching me all day?

23:04.800 --> 23:05.847
We're not done.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.850
- Hey, Jer.
- Ls Elena with you? She's in trouble.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.886
No, she's at your school today.
What's going on?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.602
Liv is up to something. She said
Elena is important to the Travelers.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.087
Liv? Since when do you two talk?

23:19.240 --> 23:22.050
I'll tell you everything later,
but I gotta go find Elena.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.962
Lucky us. First ones here.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.409
Shut up.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.289
Are you okay?

23:46.480 --> 23:48.608
Shh. I said no talking.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.650
Hey.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.242
Hey, Elena. Elena.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.606
Elena.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.731
I tell my
students chemistry is about...

24:06.920 --> 24:08.445
attraction and reaction.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.085
Hey...

24:10.240 --> 24:14.484
you're missing an incredibly
boring presentation.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.850
I need some air.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.081
As you can imagine...

24:19.240 --> 24:23.768
it's the more destructive reactions that
your students are the most interested in.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.371
Elena Gilbert.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.283
- Just the girl I'm looking for.
- Liv?

24:40.480 --> 24:42.289
<i>Hey-</i>

24:42.440 --> 24:44.363
What are you doing here?

24:45.240 --> 24:46.401
Is this about Jeremy?

24:47.320 --> 24:50.051
No. This is about you.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.566
Sorry about this.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.649
My coven did everything in its power
to protect you.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.965
- But you're just too dangerous, so...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.970
And you never will.

25:20.160 --> 25:24.768
Little tip. If you're gonna show up to kill
someone, don't waste time feeling bad about it.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.486
Hazel seemed nice.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.881
So, you know,
I figured why not have dinner?

25:34.040 --> 25:37.931
I showered, picked her up, and that was it.
That's the last thing I remember.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.969
She kidnapped you that night.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.249
Locked you up ever since and hid you away
from anyone that knew magic.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.808
- Well, like you said, she was a real witch.
- Yeah.

25:46.960 --> 25:51.124
- I don't know why I'm telling you my life story.
- It's because I compelled you to.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.567
And to stay calm and to not worry.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.405
Hmm. Why do you wanna know
so much about me?

25:56.560 --> 25:59.040
I just wanna make
sure that you're a good guy.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.210
No skeletons in the closet,
that sort of thing.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.931
- And?
- And...

26:05.120 --> 26:09.284
you are just about one of the
nicest people I've ever met.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.527
- Heh.
- Hmm.

26:10.680 --> 26:15.049
Well, likewise.
Because I do remember you saving my life.

26:15.200 --> 26:20.525
So if there's anything that I can do
to repay you, let me know.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.371
Let's just call it over

26:24.960 --> 26:27.691
<i>All the broken hearts
in the world still beat</i>

26:39.880 --> 26:42.611
<i>Girls chase boys chase girls</i>

26:43.480 --> 26:47.371
Uh, what I need from you
isn't something I can take.

26:48.320 --> 26:51.051
- I don't understand.
- Well, you don't have to.

26:51.240 --> 26:55.404
You just remind me of someone
who's really important to me.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.802
Well, he's one hell of a lucky guy.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.769
Heh. Yeah.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.445
So are you.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.970
After this, you're gonna get on the train,
ride until you find a place that you like...

27:06.120 --> 27:07.804
meet a pretty girl, settle down...

27:07.960 --> 27:11.521
and be happy
for the rest of your long, long life.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.689
<i>Let's not make it harder than it has to be</i>

27:17.360 --> 27:19.806
Just go easy on the carbs. Heh.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.450
They're a killer.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.407
- Enough. Ow.
- Hardly.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.087
She was two seconds away from killing you.
I wanna know why.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.326
So I am gonna rip this nasty rag
out of your mouth.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.684
If I hear so much as one syllable of
hocus-pocus, one of us is gonna break your neck.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.968
It's gonna be me.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.241
Talk.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.281
- All right.
- Ugh!

27:50.480 --> 27:51.561
Damon, stop.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.644
You cannot tell me what to do anymore.
We broke up, remember?

27:54.800 --> 27:57.041
This is exactly why we broke up.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.687
- Please tell me you understand that.
- Oh, my God, just kill me already.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.842
Tempting, but not until you talk.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.087
She's the last female doppelganger.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.050
After tonight, there might only be
one male doppelganger.

28:12.200 --> 28:16.728
And if that happens,
the Travelers will come for you, Elena.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.241
To use you.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.729
The witches can't let that happen.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.086
It it's between you or the psychopath,
you know what I have to do.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.528
And if you do, then what?
Am I supposed to hate you or resent you?

28:30.680 --> 28:32.045
- Or forgive you?
- Your choice.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.010
The only way you're gonna get to make it
is if you are alive.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.003
Please tell me you understand that.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.130
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- Oh, God.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.287
You wanna kill Liv, you'll
have to kill me too.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.803
- Who are you?
- Friends of Jeremy and Elena.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.042
Even Damon. Sometimes.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.090
Oh, and don't forget Bonnie.
She told us you might be here.

29:17.240 --> 29:22.326
Well, blood's thicker than water,
and my sister's in there. So...

29:22.920 --> 29:26.129
- Unh!
- Yeah. She showed us that trick before.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.209
What are you waiting for? Go on.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.362
- It wouldn't be the first time you killed me.
- Jeremy.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.046
She tried to stake your sister.
She'll do it again.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.091
No, she won't. She is gonna help
keep Elena safe. I will make sure of that.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.766
How? You can't even get a passing grade
in penmanship.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.531
Trust me. I won't let anyone hurt you.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.280
After all the things
you've been pulling at school...

29:48.440 --> 29:51.489
how could I trust you?
You haven't been making good decisions.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.129
How do you expect me to care about school
when this is my life?

29:55.960 --> 29:59.123
Take a look around. It's not like I
could bring my teachers a note...

29:59.280 --> 30:03.251
saying, "Hey, sorry I missed class today.
We were under a doppelganger invasion."

30:05.160 --> 30:07.128
But I know what I'm doing.

30:08.480 --> 30:13.281
Please. Liv knows more about the Travelers
than she's letting on.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.522
- Let's go, Damon.
- Oh... You can't be serious.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.602
I trust him, okay? And right now...

30:28.320 --> 30:30.129
I really need you to trust me.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.843
- Where were you?
- We wouldn't be here if you'd just killed Elena.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.402
I was almost turned into an ashtray
or whatever crap they make in woodshop.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.130
Thanks for the brotherly concern.

30:52.680 --> 30:58.005
So here's plan C. You're gonna protect Elena,
and I'm gonna help you stop the Travelers.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.521
You realize
this is an epic conflict of interest?

31:00.960 --> 31:05.329
Maybe not. Jeremy's got hunter skills,
and he's not afraid to take a stand.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.562
If the Travelers are
coming for his sister...

31:07.760 --> 31:11.367
or making a move on
Mystic Falls or both...

31:11.520 --> 31:13.443
he's gonna see it coming before we do.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.846
- So, what's the catch?
- I'm gonna need some help.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.202
More townies. No.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.365
They're part of the deal.
Take it or leave it.

31:31.200 --> 31:36.081
- I don't think I've ever eaten so much in my life.
- Yeah. I don't think anyone has.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.682
- Then I suppose it was a fitting last supper.
- No!

31:44.600 --> 31:46.045
Why the hell did you do that?

31:46.240 --> 31:49.130
You're not the only one who cut a deal
to save someone's life.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.846
That old flame I mentioned, Maggie, Travelers
claim they know where to find her.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.765
Yeah, well, if she's anything like me,
then she just lost all respect for you.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.404
Then I'll earn her forgiveness in time.

32:04.880 --> 32:09.169
Because unlike you, Caroline, I'm willing to
do whatever it takes for the people I love.

32:12.240 --> 32:16.928
Travelers moved to some junkyard
just outside Mystic Falls.

32:17.120 --> 32:20.249
Feel free to tell Stefan
you're the one who saved his life.

32:38.440 --> 32:39.646
Penny for your thoughts?

32:42.040 --> 32:45.522
- I'm thinking Mrs. Douglas is right.
- The guidance counselor?

32:46.200 --> 32:48.601
What does she know about the crap
we're dealing with?

32:48.760 --> 32:50.842
She spelled it out for us, Damon.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.731
It's not that we're bad for each other.
We're bad for Jeremy.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.571
Jeremy's whole life is bad for Jeremy.
You want to fix him?

32:56.720 --> 32:59.769
Put him on a plane, get him out of town.
We did what he wanted.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.446
Against my better judgment, I might add.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.284
The man of the hour.
Where are you going, Little Gilbert?

33:08.440 --> 33:10.647
Matt and Tyler said I could stay
at their place.

33:11.080 --> 33:14.243
What? No, Jer, you don't have to do that.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.841
Put the bags down. We'll
talk in the morning.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.209
No, we won't.
I should have moved out a long time ago.

33:20.360 --> 33:24.524
- I know things have been a little crazy...
- You know that they're always gonna be crazy.

33:25.280 --> 33:28.568
And I need to figure out
how to deal with crazy on my own.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.529
Right now, this is what's best for me.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.287
For all of us.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.969
I'm not asking for permission.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.323
Okay, I'll...

33:44.120 --> 33:46.043
I'll call every day and I'll...

33:46.760 --> 33:49.001
I'll make sure to stay more involved.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.768
Stefan?

34:21.920 --> 34:23.331
<i>Hey-</i>

34:23.480 --> 34:24.811
Hey.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.891
- Are you...?
- A big fat failure? Yup.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.487
But on the bright side,
I'm also exhausted and very cranky.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.842
It's good to see you anyway.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.484
So you wanna tell me what happened?

34:41.159 --> 34:43.003
<i>I</i> just did.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.924
I failed.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.681
I couldn't kill him, Stefan.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.251
Not even to save you.

34:53.800 --> 34:59.011
You do realize that you're feeling guilty
for not being able to kill somebody, right?

34:59.200 --> 35:03.683
No. I'm feeling guilty
because you're still being held prisoner.

35:03.880 --> 35:08.647
Come on, Caroline. They were never gonna
let me out. I'm too important to them.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.689
Well, you're even more important now.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.249
Enzo killed Tom.

35:16.040 --> 35:21.171
- Yet another reason to hate Enzo, I guess.
- I should have seen it coming.

35:21.320 --> 35:25.769
That whole flirty "Oh, I'm so charming
because I want to distract you" thing.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.844
I mean, I practically invented that.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.569
And what do we do now?

35:35.560 --> 35:37.050
We go to sleep.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.325
Wh...? Heh. That's heroic.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.888
The hero part of my brain
needs to recharge after, you know...

35:44.040 --> 35:48.523
being tortured all day while you were
out flirting with yet another British man.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.886
Shut up.

35:50.080 --> 35:51.809
Ha, ha, that's very funny.

35:52.240 --> 35:56.370
We gather our strength,
wait for an opportunity...

35:56.520 --> 35:57.851
get the hell out of here.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.851
Together.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.609
You knew.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.081
That's why you let me go...

36:14.240 --> 36:18.086
because you knew the whole time,
didn't you?

36:18.600 --> 36:22.730
- I knew what?
- That I couldn't do it.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.645
Not that you couldn't do it.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.566
That you wouldn't do it.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.486
How?

36:39.400 --> 36:42.210
Because that's what makes you, you.

37:15.320 --> 37:18.085
Something tells me you're not packing
for our honeymoon.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.770
I'm going back to campus.

37:19.960 --> 37:23.123
You realize you leaving
doesn't solve anything, right?

37:23.280 --> 37:27.171
I mean, especially now that Jeremy is
free and clear of our horrible influence.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.845
It's not about Jeremy.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.003
It's about us.

37:32.160 --> 37:37.803
It's not just that we're bad for each other.
It's that when we're together...

37:37.960 --> 37:40.691
we do bad things for each other.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.283
I can't live like that.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.767
I'll drive you to Whitmore.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.809
If you do that, then...

37:50.960 --> 37:52.849
I'm gonna spend the entire car ride...

37:53.040 --> 37:56.681
thinking about your hand next to mine,
and even though I'll try...

37:57.680 --> 38:00.047
I won't be able to stop myself
from taking it.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.361
Or from letting you kiss me...

38:03.560 --> 38:06.530
and we're never gonna get
to where we need to go.

38:07.880 --> 38:12.044
We'll just end up back here
where we started.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.360
That's why I need you to let me go.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.964
No, Damon...

38:26.720 --> 38:28.802
- ...I can't...
- Shh, shh, shh.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.244
Travel safe.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.245
Hey, Jer. Um...

38:56.400 --> 38:59.847
I haven't heard back,
and I have a million questions, so...

39:00.560 --> 39:03.609
I miss you and I'm confused.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.330
That's all.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.604
Call me?

39:21.040 --> 39:23.407
What the hell is that?

39:42.320 --> 39:43.651
Those buckets.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.649
They're drinking my blood and Elena's.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.126
Oh, my God.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.607
This is it. Here, take my hand.
