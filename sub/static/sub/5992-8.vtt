00:01.322 --> 00:04.362
<i>(NARRATOR)
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:04.562 --> 00:07.322
<i>I was born a Saxon lord,
but raised as a Dane,</i>

00:07.522 --> 00:11.762
<i>until the eve of my sister's wedding
when my family were murdered.</i>

00:11.962 --> 00:13.962
<i>I am a warrior,</i>

00:14.162 --> 00:17.402
<i>but when the Dane's attacked
Alfred's stronghold of Winchester,</i>

00:17.602 --> 00:20.362
<i>all a man could do was run.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:24.002
<i>Some faster than others. Including
my enemy, Young Odda.</i>

00:24.282 --> 00:26.882
<i>And so Guthrum took Winchester.</i>

00:27.082 --> 00:30.322
<i>Aethe/wo/d pledged his allegiance
to the Danes.</i>

00:30.522 --> 00:33.402
<i>Though Guthrum
still feared Alfred's god.</i>

00:33.602 --> 00:37.522
<i>I could only hope my now-distant
wife and child would be safe.</i>

00:38.322 --> 00:42.642
<i>We had no choice but to hide,
and pray for</i> a <i>miracle.</i>

00:42.842 --> 00:46.442
<i>lseult, my virgin queen,
saved the king's son,</i>

00:46.642 --> 00:49.402
<i>but at</i> a <i>cost only she could see.</i>

00:50.082 --> 00:52.282
<i>She gave Alfred strength.</i>

00:52.882 --> 00:57.242
<i>With the king alive and well,
there is hope for Wessex.</i>

00:57.562 --> 00:59.802
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

01:41.122 --> 01:43.362
(WULFHERE) We have fired
a good number of ships.

01:43.522 --> 01:45.042
- (UHTRED) A fleet.
- A fleet.

01:45.202 --> 01:50.002
In the meantime, we left hundreds
of Danes stranded in Wessex.

01:50.242 --> 01:53.722
Wulfhere, I do not believe
their intention was to ever leave.

01:53.922 --> 01:56.842
And in a few months there'll be
more ships, more men.

01:57.002 --> 01:59.602
- Now is the time to fight.
- (WULFHERE) To fight with what?

01:59.802 --> 02:01.882
We're without an army,
the Danes will number thousands.

02:02.042 --> 02:05.762
The men are out there and they're
waiting. What they need is the call.

02:05.962 --> 02:07.402
(WULFHERE) Indeed, but...

02:09.241 --> 02:10.801
Lord...

02:11.562 --> 02:15.162
...what if I suggest we escort you
to Frankia?

02:15.362 --> 02:18.042
That will not happen. I will not hide.

02:18.202 --> 02:19.922
Not here nor in Frankia.

02:20.282 --> 02:21.602
(WULFHERE) But my lord...

02:21.762 --> 02:23.762
(ALFRED)
I've prayed daily for guidance.

02:24.442 --> 02:28.122
The only way I see to save Wessex
is with what we have begun:

02:28.722 --> 02:30.682
One defining battle.

02:32.122 --> 02:34.082
We shall be leaving the marshes.

02:37.202 --> 02:38.642
Courage and faith.

02:40.722 --> 02:42.282
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:43.002 --> 02:44.322
Amen.

02:50.042 --> 02:55.002
It will not be recorded that King Alfred
was a weak and frail man

02:55.322 --> 02:59.682
in mind, body and soul,
unfit to be called king.

02:59.842 --> 03:04.082
- Nothing of what you say is true.
- But it would become true.

03:04.802 --> 03:06.402
Never.

03:08.002 --> 03:11.602
Now, you, my love, will remain here.

03:12.682 --> 03:17.282
- If I fail, you must go to Frankia.
- Not without you.

03:17.442 --> 03:20.242
You must save and protect
our children.

03:23.962 --> 03:25.602
For me...

03:26.522 --> 03:29.442
...there can be no other country
but England.

03:30.602 --> 03:33.362
No other wife but Aelswith.

03:37.322 --> 03:39.282
(UHTRED) Father Beocca.

03:40.122 --> 03:41.642
Father.

03:43.122 --> 03:49.002
I'm not saying I know everything,
but the king must continue to trust me.

03:49.442 --> 03:53.802
- The arrival of Asser may change him.
- Brother Asser has given him strength.

03:53.962 --> 03:56.922
The brother is not a warrior.
Now is a time for warriors.

03:58.202 --> 04:00.842
Never thought I'd say it,
we need Odda the Younger.

04:01.002 --> 04:02.762
He commands the largest fyrd.

04:02.962 --> 04:05.242
It's the beginning of our army.

04:05.842 --> 04:07.682
That is where we're headed.

04:08.402 --> 04:11.242
Uhtred, I will do everything I can
to help.

04:12.402 --> 04:16.522
I will be at your side.
I'll be a flea in Alfred's ear.

04:16.682 --> 04:20.762
- Thank you.
- Your father would be a proud man.

04:21.802 --> 04:23.642
As am I.

04:33.402 --> 04:36.562
(WULFHERE) I shall ready my men
and by tomorrow have horses waiting.

04:37.122 --> 04:38.642
Uhtred.

04:41.802 --> 04:43.802
You believe the Danes
can be defeated?

04:47.202 --> 04:50.322
I'll see you across the water,
Ealdorman Wulfhere.

04:55.242 --> 04:56.882
You Will.

05:10.562 --> 05:13.482
(GUTHRUM)
Aethelcod. Aethelcod, my friend.

05:13.642 --> 05:16.842
A man who would be king
ofVVessex.

05:17.002 --> 05:19.882
Thank you, thank you
for coming to see me.

05:20.042 --> 05:23.562
- It is Aethelwold...
- Yes. Please, sit down. Sit down.

05:24.162 --> 05:25.482
So,

05:25.642 --> 05:29.962
I want you to tell me
everything you know

05:30.122 --> 05:31.442
about Alfred.

05:31.602 --> 05:34.242
I've told you, lord.
He thinks with his dick. Heh.

05:34.402 --> 05:37.402
He can barely keep his breeches on.
Heh, heh.

05:37.562 --> 05:41.482
- Hear the question, boy.
- Not everybody enjoys a fool.

05:44.122 --> 05:45.602
Alfred...

05:46.122 --> 05:50.082
Though he may be afflicted by pain,
he's as strong a man as you will find.

05:50.922 --> 05:53.522
He is also as clever a man
as you will find.

05:53.802 --> 05:57.082
I was ready to have him as my advisor,
until he stole my crown.

05:58.682 --> 06:03.242
His strength, lord, I believe,
comes from his faith.

06:03.442 --> 06:05.362
(BRIDA LAUGHS)

06:05.602 --> 06:07.442
From God. Heh, heh, heh.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.402
Do you believe...

06:20.202 --> 06:21.522
...in this God?

06:24.802 --> 06:26.762
I believe in myself.

06:27.122 --> 06:29.962
Why did Alfred steal the crown?

06:30.122 --> 06:32.722
For silver or to be
a stronger king to the people?

06:32.882 --> 06:34.202
No. Umj... Um...

06:35.202 --> 06:39.002
- Yes, in part.
- Which is it?

06:39.762 --> 06:44.842
Unfairly, I was not seen as a man
to follow, by some.

06:46.842 --> 06:49.362
I was not a man to fight Danes,
it was said.

06:49.522 --> 06:52.602
And which is true because
I know the Danes will win. Heh, heh. Yes.

06:52.802 --> 06:57.082
Whereas... Whereas Alfred...
Alfred believes that he can win.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.362
- Even now?
- Yes.

06:59.642 --> 07:03.682
He's wrong, of course, but his faith...

07:04.722 --> 07:10.722
...that God will not desert him,
will make him believe that he will win.

07:11.522 --> 07:12.802
(CHUCKLES)

07:27.362 --> 07:28.722
Then you have to kill him.

07:30.562 --> 07:31.882
I must kill him?

07:32.482 --> 07:34.162
Who else...

07:35.002 --> 07:40.082
...than King Aethelcod
can walk into Alfred's camp

07:40.482 --> 07:44.322
and be welcomed as a friend?

08:25.242 --> 08:26.562
Shh-Shh.

08:42.761 --> 08:44.842
(LEOFRIC) Wulfhere and his men.

08:50.162 --> 08:54.202
God, save me. Stay away! I have skills!

08:54.602 --> 08:56.642
Put that piece of tin away, boy.

08:56.882 --> 09:00.962
Oh, thank Christ. You're English.
I thought you were one of them.

09:01.322 --> 09:02.922
What with the hair.

09:04.602 --> 09:06.282
Where is the Ealdorman Wulfhere?

09:08.322 --> 09:10.082
Gone, lord.

09:11.482 --> 09:15.562
- I am Halig. I take care of the horses.
- Gone where?

09:16.362 --> 09:19.762
Now I'm thinking on it, he did not say.
I thought you would know.

09:19.922 --> 09:22.602
- Wulfhere, where is he?
- (UHTRED) He's gone, lord.

09:24.042 --> 09:25.802
My lord, it's you.

09:25.962 --> 09:27.962
- (ALFRED) Where?
- (UHTRED) He didn't say.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.122
- He has left you horses, lord.
- (UHTRED) We keep moving.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.922
(ALFRED) Without Wulfhere?

09:35.082 --> 09:37.882
(UHTRED) Our plan doesn't change.
We make our way to Odda's estate.

09:48.882 --> 09:51.082
We cannot use the Roman roads.

09:52.122 --> 09:54.122
We can make our way to my farmstead,

09:54.282 --> 09:56.562
from there, across covered ground
to Odda's.

09:56.802 --> 09:59.762
- And that is the safest path, Leofric?
- It is, lord.

10:00.162 --> 10:02.242
Let's return to the others.

10:16.722 --> 10:19.242
There is pain here for you, my love.

10:43.362 --> 10:46.282
- Do you know them?
- Tenants.

11:33.602 --> 11:34.922
No.

11:47.482 --> 11:49.282
(GRUNTING)

12:30.442 --> 12:32.602
(sesame)

12:35.442 --> 12:38.482
No. No!

12:42.802 --> 12:46.042
(sesame)

12:52.042 --> 12:54.202
(ALFRED) We shall bury the dead

12:54.962 --> 12:58.282
- and pray for their souls.
- When you are ready...

13:00.002 --> 13:03.562
...l would like to say a prayer
for Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

13:16.082 --> 13:21.842
I will search for Mildrith.
She may be dead and unburied.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.362
Uhtred, no, no.

13:26.082 --> 13:31.482
She has buried your son with care
and she has left this place.

13:33.842 --> 13:36.962
It was no longer home
for her anymore.

13:37.922 --> 13:39.802
Believe me.

13:43.922 --> 13:47.082
Your tears on the earth
will show him that you loved him.

13:48.602 --> 13:51.082
(UHTRED SOBBING)

14:03.162 --> 14:05.722
Lord, may I ask what you're writing?

14:06.002 --> 14:07.362
The first of many letters.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.522
Each will say the same:

14:10.682 --> 14:13.802
The men of Wessex and beyond
shall gather at Egbert's Stone,

14:13.962 --> 14:16.202
and together we will fight.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.042
When you send out your messengers,
lord,

14:19.202 --> 14:22.282
might I suggest that you hand them
the letters personally?

14:22.922 --> 14:25.402
Perhaps place a hand
on their shoulder.

14:25.562 --> 14:27.602
It will embolden them, I'm sure.

14:29.082 --> 14:32.842
Thank you, Beocca, I will do that.

14:51.482 --> 14:55.082
You know I did this to you,
when I saved the king's son.

14:55.882 --> 14:59.362
- You did not.
- I knew an innocent would die.

15:01.042 --> 15:02.722
I'm tired of being like this.

15:05.722 --> 15:09.842
I've seen too much. I know too much.

15:13.002 --> 15:15.202
I want to see no more.

16:23.122 --> 16:24.482
(ELDER) Mildrith?

16:28.282 --> 16:29.602
Mildrith!

16:35.442 --> 16:37.002
Mildrith!

16:40.602 --> 16:43.962
(MILDRITH) Lord, you should be resting.
We should all be resting.

16:44.122 --> 16:47.722
(ELDER) I'm tired of resting.
I spend too many days doing nothing.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.842
(MILDRITH)
Sit before you become unsteady.

16:50.002 --> 16:52.562
- (ELDER) Where is my wife?
- She's resting, lord.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.122
(ELDER) My son?

16:54.282 --> 16:57.002
- (MILDRITH) He is away, lord.
- Still?

16:58.882 --> 17:02.682
Important business demands time.

17:08.602 --> 17:10.561
It is not a betrayal.

17:11.482 --> 17:12.842
No, it is not, lord.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.402
Look what I have done to you, child.

17:25.602 --> 17:29.722
- I am content enough, lord.
- Look what God has done to you.

17:31.722 --> 17:36.882
You deserve so much more
than the clothes of a nun.

17:40.082 --> 17:42.562
I have purpose, lord.

17:42.922 --> 17:47.442
My child is with God
and I am close to God.

17:48.322 --> 17:51.322
There is joy in my days, at times.

17:54.602 --> 17:57.322
Do not fear the Danes.

17:58.362 --> 18:00.242
You will be protected.

18:01.242 --> 18:03.522
My son will ensure that.

18:26.002 --> 18:27.482
You are Earl Skorpa?

18:30.082 --> 18:34.362
(SKORPA) You are here to surrender
and not waste my time.

18:34.562 --> 18:38.162
- I am here to negotiate.
- Surrender and you will live.

18:38.522 --> 18:42.762
- Talk too much and I will kill you.
- Of all the ealdormen of Wessex,

18:42.922 --> 18:48.282
I am the man who can assemble
the greatest fyrd, the greatest army.

18:48.522 --> 18:50.482
I now have to make a choice,

18:50.722 --> 18:53.802
whether to side with Guthrum
or with Skorpa.

18:54.762 --> 18:56.602
One Dane looks like the other
to me.

18:56.762 --> 19:01.482
I am occupying your land.
Why should I not simply crush you?

19:03.162 --> 19:05.642
Accept my invitation.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.322
Eat with myself and with my father,

19:09.482 --> 19:14.562
and I will tell you all about my land,
the range of my influence.

19:14.922 --> 19:18.082
I am sure an agreement
can be reached.

19:18.242 --> 19:22.922
Neither of us need lose any men.
Neither of us need be weakened.

19:23.202 --> 19:27.802
- Eat?
- And drink. At my hall.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.922
I assure you this is no trap.

19:40.362 --> 19:45.082
I will arrive at your hall
after the new moon.

19:45.242 --> 19:47.082
I shall expect you.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.642
Then we have peace,
at least for a time?

19:52.122 --> 19:54.162
(SKORPA) on, we do.

20:00.442 --> 20:02.842
(ISEULT) You have lost much.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.682
Fathers, mothers,

20:07.282 --> 20:09.002
and a son,

20:10.242 --> 20:12.082
lovers.

20:19.722 --> 20:21.842
I have you.

20:25.162 --> 20:27.122
I have a brother.

20:28.162 --> 20:31.082
- Ragnar.
- Yes.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.362
Your sister, Thyra.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.442
Yes?

20:47.562 --> 20:49.762
She is alive.

20:52.282 --> 20:56.002
No, she's dead. In the fire.

20:57.922 --> 21:02.282
Uhtred, she lives and is being held
in the north.

21:05.082 --> 21:07.202
It is the truth.

21:08.802 --> 21:11.362
Skorpa told me.

21:11.602 --> 21:14.802
I thought at first it could be a lie
to torment you.

21:14.962 --> 21:18.202
Hearing it from me
would have made it true.

21:19.642 --> 21:23.922
But now I know that it is true.
She lives.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.842
You've seen it?

21:29.482 --> 21:31.802
Yes. I've seen her.

21:33.522 --> 21:36.882
But I will see her no more,
the gift is fading.

21:38.362 --> 21:42.642
When this battle is done, Uhtred,
your path leads north.

21:44.402 --> 21:46.762
It will be time to face your past.

21:49.282 --> 21:50.722
And you'll be with me?

22:03.602 --> 22:05.642
Always.

22:07.922 --> 22:09.482
Lord,

22:10.122 --> 22:14.642
if God's help is required, how could he
look favourably upon Uhtred,

22:14.802 --> 22:16.522
a non-believer?

22:19.322 --> 22:20.842
God is good.

22:21.002 --> 22:25.122
Yes, lord, but in following the heathen,
what does that say about our beliefs?

22:25.282 --> 22:27.762
Death could be waiting
over the very next hill,

22:28.002 --> 22:30.282
and it will be Uhtred
who stands in its way.

22:30.442 --> 22:34.602
No doubt. A Dane will always protect
his plunder. The king is of value.

22:34.802 --> 22:37.802
He is here to protect the king,
something we can't do.

22:38.002 --> 22:41.002
- He is a man without a soul.
- Then I will be his soul.

22:41.162 --> 22:44.962
I will pray for him. I will ride
beside him always and into battle.

22:45.722 --> 22:49.122
- I will be his conduit to God.
- And if you fall in battle?

22:49.922 --> 22:53.842
With the help of your prayers,
I shall become invincible, I'm sure.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.402
Brother Asser...

23:03.202 --> 23:07.722
...l should like you to be
the first of my messengers.

23:22.522 --> 23:24.082
(UHTRED) Morning.

23:24.242 --> 23:26.002
(LEOFRIC) Sleep well?

23:26.322 --> 23:30.242
- (HALIG) He means did you hump well?
- I know what he means.

23:30.402 --> 23:32.122
Sleep well, lady?

23:32.722 --> 23:35.962
(ALFRED) If I may speak to you all.

23:46.922 --> 23:49.122
We are yet to complete
the first segment

23:49.322 --> 23:52.322
and reach Odda,
it's important we begin the second.

23:52.482 --> 23:55.322
Word of our army's gathering point
must be dispatched

23:55.482 --> 23:57.362
to the further reaches of our land.

23:57.522 --> 24:01.002
Brother Asser here will be
my first messenger.

24:02.602 --> 24:05.762
- Halig.
- Yes, lord.

24:06.842 --> 24:12.002
- You will also be my voice.
- I will, lord.

24:13.762 --> 24:15.522
(HILD) And me, lord.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.122
Hild?

24:18.322 --> 24:20.602
Lord, she is a woman.

24:20.762 --> 24:23.002
I'm as good a horseman
as anyone here.

24:23.162 --> 24:27.082
If it means more Danes will die,
then I'll do it.

24:27.562 --> 24:29.402
Yes, Hild.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.202
You Will.

24:57.162 --> 25:00.962
- Your horses belong to whom?
- Lord Odda.

25:03.042 --> 25:05.442
- You'll let us pass?
- You selling or buying?

25:05.602 --> 25:08.322
Selling. To the Danes.

25:09.002 --> 25:10.482
There is a peace.

25:11.562 --> 25:14.962
- Did you not know?
- That Odda has made a peace?

25:15.522 --> 25:17.522
No, I did not.

25:35.402 --> 25:37.282
Odda is loyal.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.082
We shall see for ourselves
what is true.

25:40.242 --> 25:41.802
(LEOFRIC) My lord.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.882
(UHTRED)
Lord, you should remain out of sight...

25:53.042 --> 25:55.242
...until we can be sure of your safety.

25:55.482 --> 25:56.962
(ALFRED) Odda is not a danger.

25:58.122 --> 26:00.802
(UHTRED) But who sits with Odda?

26:01.042 --> 26:05.282
- (ALFRED) I will not hide.
- (BEOCCA) Lord. Hear the advice.

26:05.842 --> 26:08.722
You are a symbol of Wessex,
the standard around which

26:08.922 --> 26:12.562
our army will gather.
You can't be put at risk.

26:15.002 --> 26:16.482
Very well.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.922
I must see this with my own eyes.

26:38.082 --> 26:40.922
- Lord, that is not advisable.
- I've made up my mind.

26:41.242 --> 26:44.042
If there is treachery,
it is something I must witness.

26:44.202 --> 26:46.562
- I'll go with you.
- I do not require a nursemaid.

26:46.722 --> 26:48.882
- I am a priest.
- And I a king.

26:49.882 --> 26:52.162
You will wait here with lseult.

26:52.762 --> 26:55.922
I am aware of the care I need to take.

27:19.922 --> 27:24.042
Nuns should not be so pretty
nor have lips that demand to be kissed.

27:25.922 --> 27:28.602
- I see you agree.
- When is it you're leaving?

27:28.762 --> 27:31.322
When I am rested, lord.

27:36.802 --> 27:38.282
Lord?

27:42.202 --> 27:43.602
(ELDER) What is it?

27:43.762 --> 27:45.642
Have the Danes arrived?

27:46.802 --> 27:49.922
(YOUNGER) Leofric, he is outside.

27:50.082 --> 27:52.002
Then bring him inside. He's our man.

27:53.122 --> 27:54.442
He is with Uhtred.

27:59.002 --> 28:00.962
Bring them both to me.

28:13.002 --> 28:15.882
(AETHELWOLD) Leofric, Uhtred.
My prayers have been answered.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.842
God is good.

28:22.042 --> 28:23.522
Lords.

28:24.122 --> 28:26.442
It is good to see you both
safe and well.

28:26.602 --> 28:28.122
Leofric,

28:28.402 --> 28:31.122
- you are home.
- Where in God's name have you been?

28:31.282 --> 28:35.002
- Hiding, lord. And killing Danes.
- Hopefully not on my land.

28:35.482 --> 28:38.962
(UHTRED) We have been sent by
the king. We bring orders from the king.

28:39.162 --> 28:40.842
- What king?
- King Alfred?

28:41.042 --> 28:45.682
- Who else, lord?
- (YOUNGER) Wessex is full of kings.

28:45.882 --> 28:48.202
There is Guthrum,
who is king of East Anglia,

28:48.362 --> 28:49.882
who now sits in Winchester.

28:50.482 --> 28:54.402
There's Aethelwold, who'll tell anyone
who cares to listen that he is king.

28:54.762 --> 28:56.082
Where will it end?

28:56.282 --> 28:58.722
- I have Alfred's order.
- It means nothing.

28:58.922 --> 29:02.882
- You are to raise the fyrd.
- It is over for Alfred.

29:04.562 --> 29:07.002
Alfred gave up on Wessex.

29:07.362 --> 29:10.322
He decided to save himself.

29:10.962 --> 29:15.442
No man has been more loyal to Alfred
than my father and I,

29:15.722 --> 29:18.522
but he has failed us!

29:18.762 --> 29:22.002
Danes surround us and he is hiding.

29:22.322 --> 29:26.922
Alfred is king of the eels,
slippery and elusive.

29:27.762 --> 29:29.282
I see it's true.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.122
You have sided with the Danes.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.202
What has Skorpa promised you?

29:39.362 --> 29:41.482
Are you to be king, Odda?

29:42.482 --> 29:45.042
- Leofric, are you still my man?
- Am I right?

29:45.202 --> 29:47.322
I asked you a question, Leofric.

29:47.842 --> 29:49.442
I am still your man, lord.

29:52.842 --> 29:57.042
Then you will finish the business
you have with this Dane and kill him.

30:00.162 --> 30:02.162
You have my order. Kill him.

30:02.922 --> 30:06.202
- Lord, I cannot do that.
- (UHTRED) I'm Alfred's messenger.

30:06.362 --> 30:08.162
(YOUNGER) I will not tell you again.

30:08.322 --> 30:11.722
Should any man try to kill me,
that man is a traitor to the king.

30:11.922 --> 30:14.522
(YOUNGER) You will kill him.
Alfred is no longer my king!

30:14.682 --> 30:16.802
- (LEOFRIC) I will not do it, lord.
- (ELDER) My son.

30:17.122 --> 30:19.002
Father, you will not interfere.

30:23.802 --> 30:26.082
(GRUNTING)

30:35.242 --> 30:37.322
May your mother forgive me.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.082
And may you be forgiven
for your treason.

30:48.882 --> 30:51.402
(CROWD MURMURING)

31:01.602 --> 31:05.602
Lord, forgive him.

31:06.682 --> 31:10.882
Let him die a noble. Forgive him.

31:11.962 --> 31:14.842
I ask you this as your servant.

31:17.482 --> 31:18.922
Odda...

31:20.802 --> 31:23.522
...you will do as I command.

31:24.762 --> 31:27.642
You will raise the Somerset fyrd.

31:29.242 --> 31:34.362
Lord, forgive my son. Please!

31:34.562 --> 31:39.562
I will not forgive what I have seen.

31:41.722 --> 31:44.242
You will raise the fyrd.

31:47.482 --> 31:49.522
Yes, lord.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.402
I will need 20 horsemen...

32:15.002 --> 32:21.802
...to take word to all men
able to carry sword, hook or spear.

32:24.002 --> 32:28.682
The word is that Alfred is king.

32:28.882 --> 32:30.802
(CROWD CHEERING)

32:31.722 --> 32:38.522
And will fight alongside the swords
of Wessex to his dying breath!

32:38.682 --> 32:42.042
(CROWD CHEERING)

33:03.722 --> 33:05.562
May we speak...

33:08.802 --> 33:10.442
"aboutourson?

33:12.842 --> 33:14.562
You know?

33:15.522 --> 33:17.762
Then there is nothing left to say.

33:21.122 --> 33:25.082
I'm sorry that his death was something
that you had to face alone.

33:26.282 --> 33:31.602
I was not alone. Being without
a husband does not mean I am alone.

33:32.402 --> 33:35.082
Then I am sorry for the life
that I've given you.

33:35.242 --> 33:38.722
I've found peace.
I hope you can do the same.

33:42.522 --> 33:44.202
Was there sickness?

33:44.962 --> 33:47.962
- I would like to understand.
- Children are frail.

33:48.682 --> 33:54.402
You will have other sons, I'm sure.
With your queen.

33:56.042 --> 34:00.522
- Is she here?
- Yes.

34:02.242 --> 34:06.882
I would like you to leave me alone.
Never speak to me again.

34:07.042 --> 34:09.842
We have nothing that binds us,
nothing.

34:10.042 --> 34:13.722
Avoid me. Please.

34:34.962 --> 34:39.482
Uhtred Ragnarson.
Should I be pleased to see you?

34:39.641 --> 34:44.962
- Skorpa of the White Horse.
- I am expected by the Lord Odda.

34:45.161 --> 34:48.042
The Lord Odda's in the ground,
buried as a traitor.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.681
So, what now?

34:53.562 --> 34:55.202
Do I speak with you?

34:56.322 --> 34:58.002
Does the truce stand?

34:58.162 --> 35:00.242
For today it stands.

35:00.402 --> 35:01.762
Tomorrow we'll kill you.

35:02.442 --> 35:06.522
You Will kill me With What?

35:07.402 --> 35:10.362
I have almost 1000 men
to call upon.

35:10.522 --> 35:14.922
Your ships have been burned, Skorpa.
By Alfred.

35:15.322 --> 35:19.602
- He's gathering a great Saxon army.
- I am aware my ships are gone.

35:20.682 --> 35:22.242
And I will have my revenge.

35:22.442 --> 35:25.762
You should return to Guthrum
and prepare to die.

35:27.362 --> 35:29.602
Did your queen tell you...

35:30.482 --> 35:34.362
...that your sister
is being humped in the arse

35:34.522 --> 35:37.842
each and every night
by one-eyed Sven?

35:38.002 --> 35:41.482
Did your mother tell you that
she should've kept her legs closed?

35:42.722 --> 35:46.522
I will look for you first
across the battlefield.

35:46.682 --> 35:50.482
I will be there
and I will not be difficult to find.

36:01.842 --> 36:06.042
- (ALFRED) He will go to Guthrum?
- I believe he will, lord.

36:08.002 --> 36:10.842
Then the battle is one step nearer.

36:12.002 --> 36:16.162
Beocca, you should wash out
your mouth.

36:16.882 --> 36:21.002
Yes, lord, I will. With ale.

36:44.842 --> 36:49.282
- (GUTHRUM) How many men?
- (RAGNAR) Four hundred. No more.

36:49.602 --> 36:52.122
And this is the great Saxon army?

36:53.002 --> 36:54.882
(SKORPA) Their numbers will grow.

36:55.882 --> 37:01.162
We need to march. There needs
to be a story of a slaughter.

37:01.322 --> 37:04.122
Only days ago Ragnar
was asking if the war was over.

37:05.202 --> 37:07.602
Skorpa is right,
there must be a slaughter.

37:07.762 --> 37:11.642
We must take the fight to Alfred
and his god.

37:12.242 --> 37:15.842
And you are ready to kill your brother?

37:19.282 --> 37:22.362
If it comes to that, yes.

37:28.722 --> 37:31.362
Then we shall face one great army
with another.

37:32.362 --> 37:37.322
(ALFRED) Once the armies are
assembled, I shall speak to them as one.

37:38.482 --> 37:44.242
Each man should know
this war is not only about land.

37:45.042 --> 37:49.962
Should the heathens win,
then Christ is defeated.

37:52.402 --> 37:57.362
(UHTRED) When you speak to the men,
lord, you cannot make it a sermon.

37:57.882 --> 38:00.162
(ALFRED)
Then what do you suggest I say?

38:01.242 --> 38:04.282
(UHTRED) Tell them that you'll die
for them, that's good.

38:05.402 --> 38:07.882
Tell them that we'll make the Danes
pay in blood

38:08.042 --> 38:10.562
and that they'll be rewarded in plunder.

38:11.082 --> 38:13.402
(ALFRED)
I am to talk of revenge and greed?

38:13.562 --> 38:15.762
(UHTRED)
They are men, lord, not angels.

38:20.122 --> 38:23.522
- (ALFRED) We shall stop for a moment.
- (LEOFRIC) Hold!

38:24.162 --> 38:25.882
We hold!

38:34.082 --> 38:35.562
Lord.

38:36.362 --> 38:38.002
It is Egbert's Stone.

38:39.802 --> 38:44.242
Within these next few yards,
we will know if we have an army...

38:45.322 --> 38:47.482
...of angels or otherwise.

38:49.602 --> 38:51.282
I will go alone.

38:58.682 --> 39:00.962
If no one is there, what then?

39:04.682 --> 39:06.282
I see.

39:20.002 --> 39:22.202
Not a single one.

39:24.402 --> 39:29.002
Not a single man has answered my call.

39:31.642 --> 39:33.522
Then we wait.

39:34.962 --> 39:37.122
We must wait, lord.

39:55.202 --> 39:56.802
A fine knife.

39:58.522 --> 40:02.042
- A Dane's knife.
- This thing?

40:03.322 --> 40:06.082
Yes, I took it from a Dane.
A Dane I killed.

40:06.402 --> 40:08.922
- Where?
- Winchester.

40:09.082 --> 40:11.482
This is before you
grovelled to Guthrum?

40:11.682 --> 40:15.642
Before I presented myself to him, yes.

40:15.882 --> 40:20.202
I was not, however, treated in a kingly
manner, and decided to escape.

40:20.362 --> 40:22.922
A king under the Danes is no king.

40:23.402 --> 40:27.082
Uhtred, I do like you,
but I rather tire of your preaching.

40:27.682 --> 40:31.122
- You ever thought of becoming a priest?
- Ever since I was a boy.

40:31.322 --> 40:35.242
That's a lie. I baptised him twice.
He's still not a Christian.

40:37.642 --> 40:39.082
For luck.

40:42.162 --> 40:43.922
Then I'll need a lock from you.

40:45.882 --> 40:48.322
- Where's Alfred?
- Watching.

40:50.242 --> 40:52.242
Waiting for his army.

40:55.882 --> 40:58.562
I think I shall go and sit with him
a while.

41:01.682 --> 41:03.802
You are fond of him now?

41:17.442 --> 41:18.962
For luck.

42:19.682 --> 42:21.002
Lord.

42:27.602 --> 42:29.762
I thought you would like company.

42:42.002 --> 42:44.682
What do you see?
What do you hear? Tell me.

42:44.842 --> 42:47.522
- I hear nothing, lord.
- No, no.

42:49.082 --> 42:51.602
There is a change in the shadows.

42:52.162 --> 42:54.602
In the air. They are out there.

42:54.762 --> 42:57.202
I see nothing but grass, lord.

42:58.042 --> 43:00.882
- And beyond the grass, trees.
- There, there.

43:03.042 --> 43:04.402
It's men.

43:06.922 --> 43:08.482
And more men there.

43:11.002 --> 43:12.922
They have answered the call.

43:13.682 --> 43:17.642
They have answered the call.
The swords of England, they're coming.

Today is a day for warriors.

43:42.202 --> 43:45.122
A day to kill your enemies.

they had never heard of Wessex.

We have men here from Northumbria,
from Mercia, from East Anglia.

44:13.002 --> 44:15.402
And why are the pagans here?

44:16.562 --> 44:19.362
They want your wives
for their pleasure.

44:19.522 --> 44:22.162
They want your children
as their slaves.

44:22.482 --> 44:27.922

44:53.602 --> 44:57.362
We shall make the ground red

44:57.562 --> 45:00.522
We shall strip them
of what they have plundered.

45:00.682 --> 45:03.442
We shall make them cry out for mercy,
