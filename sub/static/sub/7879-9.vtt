♪ Good morning, USA!

00:35.503 --> 00:38.080
All right, quiet down, everyone.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.716
Shh! Deputy's talking.

00:39.841 --> 00:41.117
Shut your face, Sanders!

00:41.242 --> 00:43.486
Well, it's the start of summer,

00:43.611 --> 00:46.222
or, more officially, our slow season.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.292
Terrorism drops as our Johnny Jihads

00:49.417 --> 00:52.595
trade in their bomb suitcases
for bomb pops.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.648
Two strikes, kiss-ass!

00:55.773 --> 00:57.700
Find out what a third gets you!

00:57.825 --> 00:59.042
I dare you!

01:03.896 --> 01:05.542
Anyway, as always,

01:05.667 --> 01:07.994
we will be cutting back
to our summer hours.

01:09.754 --> 01:12.823
All right, now!
Summertime!

01:12.989 --> 01:14.417
Well, I'm off
to the lake house, boys.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.402
Jet Skis and dock sex!

01:16.527 --> 01:18.404
I'm gonna spend my summer
giving something back

01:18.529 --> 01:20.640
to the community...
chlamydia.

01:20.913 --> 01:22.508
Your guys' plans suck.

01:22.633 --> 01:25.435
I'll be spending another summer
at the country club.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.628
Stan, welcome back!

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.289 --> 01:46.666
Stan!

01:46.791 --> 01:48.275
Back to work for another summer.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.003
Horatio.
Good to be back.

01:50.128 --> 01:52.906
Groundskeepin', keeping the grounds.

01:53.031 --> 01:54.906
Beautiful day.
<i>Día bueno.</i>

01:55.072 --> 01:57.076
Hard to believe,
after working here 30 summers,

01:57.201 --> 02:00.495
I almost have enough money saved
to finally afford a membership.

02:00.661 --> 02:02.432
Ah, then you're just going
to become a rich jerk

02:02.557 --> 02:03.683
like the rest of them.

02:03.808 --> 02:05.301
The other day, Mr. Vanderhill...

02:05.426 --> 02:07.437
he stuffed a live
swan in his golf bag

02:07.562 --> 02:08.905
as a surprise for his caddy.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.173
You know what the surprise was?

02:10.298 --> 02:11.758
How far that swan took

02:11.883 --> 02:14.134
the caddy's scrotum
across the 17th fairway.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.112
Don't worry.
I'll never become one of them.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.763
Guys like Vanderhill have been handed

02:17.888 --> 02:19.282
everything their whole lives.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.517
But not me...
I've been baking in the sun

02:21.642 --> 02:23.977
on a riding mower
that's rattling my butt apart.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.339
I told you... wear seven underwears.

02:26.464 --> 02:28.007
I'm going to actually
appreciate this place

02:28.132 --> 02:29.876
because I worked for it.

02:30.001 --> 02:31.744
Kerry, give me a kiss!

02:31.869 --> 02:33.196
My wife is old.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.897
Stop calling my house!

02:35.022 --> 02:37.958
Mm. I...
I call her house.

02:40.785 --> 02:43.673
Klaus, this summer heat...

02:43.798 --> 02:45.508
gets a girl a-thinkin'.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.143
What's it all about, man?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.710
Why are we here?

02:48.876 --> 02:51.014
To eat chocolate
and get our toes done.

02:52.523 --> 02:54.007
Champagne clink.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.169
Seriously, I'm going to die one day,

02:56.294 --> 02:58.071
and I want to make sure I've left

02:58.196 --> 02:59.706
something behind I can be proud of.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.240
What about your kids?

03:01.365 --> 03:02.976
Meh.

03:03.101 --> 03:06.269
I'm talking about
something more permanent.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.348
I want to invent a catchphrase.

03:08.473 --> 03:12.192
Something as profound as
"all that and a bag of chips."

03:12.358 --> 03:13.453
Oh, come on.

03:13.578 --> 03:14.821
Don't you think everyone has tried

03:14.946 --> 03:16.239
coming up with a catchphrase?

03:16.364 --> 03:17.948
It's next to impossible.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.126
Well, Klaus, I'm going to do it.

03:20.251 --> 03:23.096
And you can put that
frog in the casserole.

03:25.156 --> 03:27.591
Bitch, what'd I just say?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.538
That's Norm MacDonald, right?

03:32.663 --> 03:34.931
How is this <i>Dancing with the Stars?</i>

03:36.534 --> 03:37.977
What a day.

03:38.102 --> 03:40.513
Got a blood blister,
smashed my thumbnail black

03:40.638 --> 03:42.389
and fried up one hell
of farmer's tan.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.633
Ugh. I know.

03:43.758 --> 03:45.392
I've got one, too.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.994
Can't make fudge out of a waterfall.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.094
What are you doing?

03:55.219 --> 03:56.820
Sounded like there
was still some soda left.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.064
I don't like the last half.

03:58.189 --> 03:59.632
It's not as effervescent.

03:59.757 --> 04:01.718
Nope, the bottom's not for me.

04:01.843 --> 04:03.460
I'm what they call a top.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.806
That's a soda from my fridge,

04:06.931 --> 04:09.041
which I bought
with money I worked for.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.777
Sorry. I didn't know you wanted it.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.078
My fingers are still sticky.

04:12.203 --> 04:13.712
You can suck on them if you want.

04:17.130 --> 04:18.451
Well, I'll be upstairs

04:18.576 --> 04:20.570
melting pearls on my
tummy if you need me.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.272
Steve, you're just like
those rich jerks at the club

04:23.397 --> 04:24.707
who don't appreciate what they have

04:24.832 --> 04:26.259
because they've never worked for it.

04:26.384 --> 04:28.919
Got to appreciate to graduate.

04:30.454 --> 04:32.799
Now you have a problem
with soda <i>and</i> being rich?

04:32.924 --> 04:36.035
No, I have a problem with
people who have it too easy.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.671
I admire the self-made
men of this world.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.273
The Levi Strausses,

04:40.398 --> 04:42.157
the Hulk Hogans, the Larry Flynts.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.735
Imagine... overcoming
a name like Larry.

04:49.955 --> 04:51.918
Horatio, my son, Steve,

04:52.043 --> 04:53.586
is going to be working
with us for the summer.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.804
Welcome aboard.

04:54.929 --> 04:55.938
Thanks.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.573
Aah! What the hell?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.101
That, Steve, is a
working man's handshake.

05:03.354 --> 05:04.564
<i>A locked wrist that says</i>

05:04.689 --> 05:06.466
<i>he stands strong by his convictions,</i>

05:06.591 --> 05:08.568
<i>a firm grip that says
you can trust him,</i>

05:08.693 --> 05:10.002
<i>plenty of thick calluses</i>

05:10.127 --> 05:11.904
<i>that show he's not afraid
to persevere.</i>

05:12.029 --> 05:13.172
<i>Kind of like Shrek's hands.</i>

05:13.297 --> 05:14.314
<i>Aah!</i>

05:14.480 --> 05:15.475
My tip.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.176
Your hands are the exact opposite.

05:17.301 --> 05:19.278
But thankfully, a summer of hard work

05:19.403 --> 05:20.413
will fix you right up.

05:20.538 --> 05:21.747
Steve, you're in luck.

05:21.872 --> 05:23.349
You started here at a good time.

05:23.474 --> 05:25.867
Tomorrow is employee swim.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.869
Ooh, is that where the girls
ask the guys?

05:28.035 --> 05:30.656
Uh... huh.

05:30.781 --> 05:33.526
No, once a month,
the club gives us an hour

05:33.651 --> 05:35.428
early in the morning
to swim in the pool

05:35.553 --> 05:37.128
right before they drain it.

05:37.294 --> 05:38.364
It's magic.

05:41.006 --> 05:42.819
Oh, no.
It's Vanderhill!

05:44.211 --> 05:45.905
A bird distracted me on my backswing.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.707
It was going...

05:47.832 --> 05:50.076
That's not my name, and it
was saying it right at me.

05:50.201 --> 05:51.744
Yes, Mr. Vanderhill.
Yes, Mr. Vanderhill.

05:51.869 --> 05:53.146
I'm sure it was a female.

05:53.271 --> 05:55.148
Now, go find its nest
and smash its offspring

05:55.273 --> 05:56.949
before I shoot you with my turd gun.

05:58.876 --> 06:00.953
Yes, Mr. Vanderhill.
Yes, Mr. Vanderhill.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.255
Roger?

06:02.380 --> 06:03.422
Hey!

06:03.547 --> 06:05.191
Why didn't my dad recognize you?

06:05.316 --> 06:06.425
Oh, everyone in the family

06:06.550 --> 06:08.494
has one persona they
can't see through.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.396
Your mom's is my Korean kid

06:10.521 --> 06:12.064
who shoots pool with
a giant chopstick.

06:12.189 --> 06:13.581
No way.

06:13.824 --> 06:15.868
And Hayley doesn't realize
I'm her sandal repairman.

06:15.993 --> 06:17.293
Get out.

06:17.459 --> 06:19.587
And remember that spin
the bottle party you went to?

06:19.753 --> 06:21.047
Yeah.

06:35.227 --> 06:36.956
You were Alicia Wilkner?

06:37.081 --> 06:38.524
We went on seven dates!

06:38.649 --> 06:40.393
Nine. I roofied you on two of them.

06:40.518 --> 06:42.402
Nothing happened.
Wink, wink.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.696
But how can you afford
a membership here?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.716
Concise story.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.619
Several years ago,
I married some 95-year-old bag

06:49.744 --> 06:51.286
two weeks before she kicked it.

06:54.788 --> 06:56.526
Reverse Anna Nicole Smithed her.

06:56.651 --> 06:58.294
Her daughter was not thrilled.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.087
You're never going to get
your mom's money, Pamela!

07:03.923 --> 07:05.234
Why you dressed like Peter Venkman?

07:05.359 --> 07:07.470
It's Doctor, and because
Dad got me a job

07:07.595 --> 07:09.305
to teach me the value of hard work.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.207
You mean he's teaching
you to be a chump.

07:11.332 --> 07:14.043
Come on, Steve. Suckers like
him just glorify hard work

07:14.168 --> 07:16.269
because they never had an
opportunity to not work hard.

07:16.821 --> 07:19.498
Believe me, everyone takes
the easy way if they can.

07:19.623 --> 07:21.367
That's why we tell fart jokes.

07:21.492 --> 07:23.002
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

07:29.573 --> 07:32.211
Ah, this water feels good
on my jeans.

07:32.336 --> 07:33.779
Where's Steve?

07:33.904 --> 07:35.997
Can't believe he's missing
employee swim.

07:37.391 --> 07:38.701
Vanderhill.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.002
Steve, what are you doing?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.211
I'm so sorry, Mr. Vanderhill.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.355
Silence, worker.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.290
I've decided to give your boy a job

07:44.415 --> 07:45.725
hanging out with me for the summer.

07:45.850 --> 07:47.560
I like him.
He makes me laugh.

07:47.685 --> 07:49.662
Looks like it's tee time, boys.

07:51.188 --> 07:52.832
You can't teach that.

07:52.957 --> 07:55.401
Oh, and by the by,
I pay like I walk...

07:55.526 --> 07:56.736
handsomely.

07:57.017 --> 07:57.987
That's not a job.

07:58.112 --> 08:00.647
He's just getting paid to...
to lounge around.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.358
I'm sorry... is an employee
talking back to a member?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.252
Didn't think so.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.169
Steve, meet the fellas.

08:28.294 --> 08:30.718
This is Dill Shepherd
and Johnny Golf.

08:30.884 --> 08:32.823
Actually, it's Johnny
Golf Swimandtennis,

08:32.948 --> 08:34.347
but that's a real mouthful.

08:35.467 --> 08:37.412
The calamari, the rib eye,

08:37.537 --> 08:39.581
the turkey club, the key lime pie

08:39.706 --> 08:41.816
and the crab-stuffed Dover sole?

08:41.941 --> 08:43.241
Yo!

08:46.029 --> 08:47.739
That's enough of that.

08:49.332 --> 08:52.201
Steve, honey, finish pushing
that onto the floor for me.

08:54.304 --> 08:55.869
Good boy.
Here's a hundo.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.633
I don't like this, Horatio.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.135
These are not the type of people

09:00.260 --> 09:01.870
I want my son to be influenced by.

09:01.995 --> 09:03.672
Don't worry, Stan.
He's a good kid.

09:03.797 --> 09:06.174
I'm sure he'll be able to
keep his head on straight.

09:07.734 --> 09:09.110
Yeah! I hate birds

09:09.235 --> 09:11.096
and am therefore glad
that you kicked one.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.219
Here is money.

09:17.094 --> 09:18.904
"Spare me your dance recital."

09:19.029 --> 09:20.338
No.

09:20.463 --> 09:22.741
"Forget the mustard.
It's karate time."

09:22.866 --> 09:24.242
Eh.

09:24.367 --> 09:27.012
"Things are getting too spicy
for the pepper."

09:27.137 --> 09:28.914
Wait! What was that? Just now.

09:29.039 --> 09:30.695
"Things are getting too spicy
for the pepper?"

09:30.861 --> 09:32.071
That's it.
That's it?

09:32.237 --> 09:34.853
"Things are getting too
spicy for the pepper."

09:34.978 --> 09:36.154
Your catchphrase.

09:36.279 --> 09:37.656
Of course!

09:37.781 --> 09:39.224
Now you just have to test it out.

09:39.349 --> 09:40.825
Things are getting...

09:40.950 --> 09:43.285
On someone other than me, bitch.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.849
Mom, are you okay?

09:47.974 --> 09:49.547
You look like you're going to burst.

09:49.713 --> 09:51.810
Not yet.

09:53.913 --> 09:55.106
Anyone seen Steve?

09:55.231 --> 09:57.125
I didn't see him
at the club all afternoon.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.848
Maybe things got too spic...

10:00.599 --> 10:01.429
Hey, now.

10:01.554 --> 10:02.685
Steve, where you been?

10:02.851 --> 10:05.216
Let me guess... Vanderhill
fired you already.

10:05.341 --> 10:08.219
No. Mr. Vanderhill
wanted to sleep one off,

10:08.344 --> 10:11.289
so he paid me for the full day
and let me leave at noon.

10:11.414 --> 10:13.208
Whew. I am stuffed.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.943
The loaf was great, Francine.

10:15.068 --> 10:16.444
It's just, I filled up on lobster

10:16.569 --> 10:17.746
and chocolate soufflé at the club.

10:17.871 --> 10:19.631
Here...
for your trouble.

10:19.756 --> 10:22.288
That's it!
No tipping your mother.

10:22.454 --> 10:23.852
Looks like things are getting

10:23.977 --> 10:26.245
too spicy for the pepper.

10:29.315 --> 10:32.027
We do not take the easy way
in this house.

10:32.152 --> 10:33.294
Just like...
I know.

10:33.419 --> 10:35.196
Self-made men, hard work, Hulk Hogan.

10:35.321 --> 10:36.865
Honest work is for suckers.

10:36.990 --> 10:39.389
Easy way... best way.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.935
Is that so, big shot?

10:41.060 --> 10:43.121
Because, thanks to my last paycheck,

10:43.246 --> 10:46.391
I now have enough saved to
buy my way into the club.

10:46.516 --> 10:47.926
And it's going to be even sweeter

10:48.051 --> 10:50.362
because it wasn't handed
to me on a silver platter.

10:50.487 --> 10:53.403
I earned it...
all seven grand.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.834
Ha! Seven grand?

10:55.959 --> 10:58.069
Dad, that was the cost
of a membership

10:58.194 --> 11:00.410
30 years ago
when you first started saving.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.494
Wh-What?

11:01.660 --> 11:03.975
It's, like, 200 grand now.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.227
You thought... Wow!

11:06.352 --> 11:09.014
Well, keep on being a working
sucker and maybe you can

11:09.139 --> 11:12.046
appreciate the club
when you're 85, if you're lucky.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.492
Mr. Vanderhill!

11:20.617 --> 11:22.811
Please, Mr. Vanderhill was my father.

11:22.936 --> 11:24.142
Call me Spartacus.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.648
I may never have a chance of
being a member at this club,

11:26.773 --> 11:28.266
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit by

11:28.391 --> 11:29.734
and let you corrupt my son.

11:29.859 --> 11:31.302
Me and you, a round of golf.

11:31.427 --> 11:33.735
If I win, Steve comes
back to work with us.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.457
Ooh, a bet.

11:35.582 --> 11:38.489
Okay, but if I win,
no more employee swim.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.332
You against the guy that knows
every blade of this course?

11:44.457 --> 11:46.568
I'll bet you 200 Gs you lose.

11:46.693 --> 11:48.236
Johnny's crazy today.

11:48.361 --> 11:49.370
I love it.

11:49.495 --> 11:50.585
Count me in, too.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.440
Fine, I'll take all your action.

11:52.565 --> 11:53.508
Okay, then.

11:53.633 --> 11:54.672
Good luck.

11:56.553 --> 11:57.846
Ow!

11:57.971 --> 12:00.887
That's the hand I use to
peel bananas, you ass.

12:01.136 --> 12:03.222
♪

12:32.918 --> 12:36.334
After the first hole,
the score is... 35 to 36.

12:36.459 --> 12:37.502
You both suck.

12:37.627 --> 12:39.003
What do you say next hole wins?

12:39.128 --> 12:40.171
We don't have all day.

12:40.296 --> 12:41.677
Yep.
Sounds good.

12:41.969 --> 12:46.201
All right, Stan, if you don't
make this, you lose.

12:54.110 --> 12:55.066
Yay!

12:56.567 --> 12:57.388
Sucks!

12:57.513 --> 12:58.957
Oh, fiddlesticks.

12:59.082 --> 13:02.073
400 grand and no more
poor people in the pool!

13:02.239 --> 13:04.158
But I just bought a noodle.

13:04.324 --> 13:05.964
Come on, boys, let's go get drunk

13:06.089 --> 13:07.665
and play talcum tag
in the locker room.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.217
All right.
Here we go.

13:09.342 --> 13:11.176
Oh, that is my passion.

13:17.717 --> 13:19.494
Steve-o, go grab some more champagne

13:19.619 --> 13:20.969
from the storage closet, huh?

13:24.720 --> 13:27.352
W-What's going on here?

13:27.477 --> 13:29.821
Oh, this is where I come to
do whip-its and think about

13:29.946 --> 13:32.357
what would happen if the Ninja
Turtles had to go to college.

13:32.482 --> 13:35.593
Vanderhill offered me a 50-50
split if I threw the match.

13:35.718 --> 13:37.529
Now I have enough to become a member.

13:37.654 --> 13:39.819
Told you everyone would take
the easy way if they could.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.733
You were right all along, Steve.

13:41.858 --> 13:43.425
Easy way, best way.

13:47.246 --> 13:49.057
I know you probably
have a lot of questions,

13:49.182 --> 13:51.159
so I'll just tell you...
the dean closes down

13:51.284 --> 13:53.094
the campus pizza shop
and the Ninja Turtles

13:53.219 --> 13:55.387
do not take it well.

14:02.666 --> 14:04.309
Does it get any better?

14:04.434 --> 14:07.813
Only if Mother could win
her battle with exhaustion

14:07.938 --> 14:10.206
and float here next to me.

14:12.442 --> 14:14.236
Oh, now there's too much ice in here.

14:14.361 --> 14:16.621
Take it back to the bartender
and bring me a new one.

14:16.746 --> 14:20.318
And punch him for me,
around this hard.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.295
Your dad seems to be
fitting in nicely.

14:23.420 --> 14:26.098
Hey, Dad, maybe you should
ease up a little?

14:26.365 --> 14:28.800
I'm very eased, Stevie.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.404
I mean, maybe tone it down.

14:32.529 --> 14:33.915
You're acting a little aggressive.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.641
If anyone's earned a right
to act like this, it's me.

14:36.766 --> 14:39.845
Like a fool, I wasted 30 long
years trying to get here.

14:39.970 --> 14:41.771
So now I'm gonna enjoy it.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.202
Hey, check it out.

14:47.327 --> 14:49.238
I just got that kid to
Mickey-Mouse-ear that guy.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.996
Francine, I think I figured out

14:58.121 --> 14:59.464
why your catchphrase fell flat.

14:59.589 --> 15:01.567
Because it was a stupid idea.

15:01.733 --> 15:04.603
No. The words are right,
just not the delivery.

15:04.728 --> 15:06.238
Try saying it like you've just been

15:06.363 --> 15:07.930
on a road trip through the South.

15:09.816 --> 15:10.759
Things are getting

15:10.884 --> 15:12.787
too spicy for the pepper!

15:12.953 --> 15:15.964
Now more like you just came in
from playing in the snow,

15:16.089 --> 15:18.084
but you haven't had
your hot chocolate yet.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.768
Things are getting

15:19.893 --> 15:21.295
too spicy for the pepper!

15:21.461 --> 15:24.206
Maybe more a mix of sadness
that your dog died,

15:24.331 --> 15:26.992
relief because he was
riddled with fatty lymphomas

15:27.117 --> 15:30.346
and joy that you can now
get a new kitty.

15:30.512 --> 15:34.716
Things are getting too spicy
for the pepper...!

15:34.841 --> 15:38.020
Watch Oscar-nominated actress
Gabourey Sidibe do it.

15:38.186 --> 15:41.113
Things are getting too spicy
for the pepper.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.864
You look nice, Dad.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.366
I had to pick up a tie
for the New Member Gala

15:51.491 --> 15:53.578
at the club tomorrow,
and I figured I'd treat myself.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.087
Ew, ham.

15:55.212 --> 15:56.488
Let's toss it and take a cab

15:56.613 --> 15:57.915
over to Long John
Silver's... my treat.

15:58.081 --> 16:01.526
Dad, doesn't it bother you at
all that you lost employee swim?

16:01.651 --> 16:02.861
Hadn't thought about it.

16:02.986 --> 16:04.746
And thank you, Steve,
for opening my eyes.

16:04.871 --> 16:06.114
If you hadn't, I'd still be

16:06.239 --> 16:07.842
wasting my time scrimping pennies.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.652
Janet Jackson played
Penny in <i>Good Times.</i>

16:10.777 --> 16:12.912
Jeff, that's the crap
that gives me a headache.

16:14.881 --> 16:17.143
Things are getting too
spicy for the pepper.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.187
Huh, that's pretty catchy, Mrs. S.

16:21.605 --> 16:25.384
I... am... immortal!

16:25.509 --> 16:26.752
Oh, that's great, honey.

16:26.877 --> 16:28.321
Set me up with the whole schmeer.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.756
You know, mugs, hats, bags,
aprons, slacks, shirts.

16:30.881 --> 16:31.823
Hey, shot glasses.

16:31.948 --> 16:33.191
I'll take a box of those.

16:33.316 --> 16:34.860
Give me a box of those
spicy pepper pens.

16:34.985 --> 16:36.245
Give me two of those, six of those.

16:36.411 --> 16:38.964
Come on, to Long John Silver's!

16:39.089 --> 16:40.766
Woo-hoo! Icelandic cod!

16:40.891 --> 16:42.224
Yay!

16:43.502 --> 16:45.044
Booyah!
Yay!

16:46.838 --> 16:48.240
Dad?

16:48.365 --> 16:49.841
Steve, why are you
dressed like Ernie Hudson?

16:49.966 --> 16:51.109
Winston Zeddemore.

16:51.234 --> 16:53.178
And because I'm going
back to work with Horatio,

16:53.303 --> 16:54.346
and you are, too.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.349
I am, am I?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.550
Yes, because I've learned my lesson.

16:58.675 --> 17:00.185
By acting like a spoiled jerk,

17:00.310 --> 17:01.920
you showed me how I was behaving.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.655
Acting? I'm not acting.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.057
I'm playing tomato tennis.

17:05.182 --> 17:06.315
Ooh! An unripe one!

17:10.904 --> 17:12.114
We lost him, Steve.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.022
Your dad is one of them.

17:21.731 --> 17:24.476
Feel good to finally hold
that member key, Stan?

17:24.601 --> 17:25.644
Sure does.

17:25.769 --> 17:28.363
I'll just put it on my key chain.

17:28.488 --> 17:31.133
Membership has its privileges.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.434
Greetings, Father.

17:33.718 --> 17:35.060
Hulk Hogan!

17:37.347 --> 17:39.691
He goes to my chiropractor.

17:39.816 --> 17:42.244
So I asked him if he'd come
talk some sense into you.

17:42.369 --> 17:45.797
Stan, my little Hulkamaniac
filled me in on what's going on,

17:45.922 --> 17:47.632
and let me tell you
something, brother.

17:47.757 --> 17:49.701
The Hulkster had to battle
my entire life

17:49.826 --> 17:50.903
to get where I am, brother.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.004
With nothing but sweat,
tears and heartache

17:53.129 --> 17:54.689
and good ol' red, white and blue

17:54.814 --> 17:56.075
pumping through my veins, brother.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.176
All the training, all the matches,

17:58.301 --> 17:59.978
all the prayers and all the brothers

18:00.103 --> 18:02.164
made me appreciate
everything I've earned.

18:02.330 --> 18:04.633
That's why, no matter
how many one, two, threes

18:04.758 --> 18:08.670
I slap on my opponents, I just
thank my lucky Mean Genes

18:08.795 --> 18:11.373
I was blessed to be able to
step into that squared circle

18:11.498 --> 18:13.884
and use these 24-inch pythons.

18:14.050 --> 18:16.611
Stan, brother,
sometimes, as a Hulkamaniac,

18:16.736 --> 18:19.598
you got to look deep down
inside yourself and ask,

18:19.764 --> 18:24.286
whatcha gonna do when Hulkamania
runs wild on you?!

18:24.411 --> 18:25.678
Yeah.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.526
Listen, Terry, I appreciate

18:30.692 --> 18:31.944
you coming out, but...

18:34.271 --> 18:35.430
Oh, what's wrong Dad?

18:35.555 --> 18:38.075
Have you developed
privileged rich guy hands?

18:38.241 --> 18:40.327
My handshake.

18:40.493 --> 18:42.154
Looks like your grip's gone soft.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.056
Probably from not
lifting a finger all day.

18:45.181 --> 18:46.491
Nonsense, Stan.

18:46.616 --> 18:48.500
Stick with what got you
here: the easy way.

19:09.222 --> 19:10.274
My son's right!

19:11.241 --> 19:13.018
I became what I despise the most.

19:13.143 --> 19:15.187
I don't want your membership,
not this way.

19:15.312 --> 19:17.823
I want to earn it,
with my working man's hands.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.158
Welcome back, Dad.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.909
What do you say, Vanderhill?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.444
You keep my membership in exchange

19:22.569 --> 19:24.045
for us getting employee swim back?

19:24.170 --> 19:26.290
No ways to your Josés.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.316
Well, Hogan, then it looks like

19:28.441 --> 19:30.385
we're gonna have to
earn swim time back

19:30.510 --> 19:31.870
the hard way.

19:34.547 --> 19:36.282
♪

20:04.277 --> 20:05.120
Roger!

20:05.245 --> 20:06.221
What are you doing here?

20:06.346 --> 20:07.973
I have so much to tell you.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.042
Oh, Pamela. Good.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.419
I was just looking for you.

20:12.585 --> 20:15.747
You have the same scowl
your mother had...

20:15.872 --> 20:17.115
when I banged her...

20:17.240 --> 20:18.592
after I pulled the plug.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.319
God, I was kidding!

20:21.444 --> 20:24.222
Looks like someone pulled
the plug on your sense of humor.

20:24.347 --> 20:26.057
This meeting is over, Pamela.

20:26.182 --> 20:27.859
Okay, the meeting's back on.

20:27.984 --> 20:31.713
First item of business:
those two hams you call arms.

20:31.838 --> 20:33.922
That one I deserved.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.103
Dad, look!

20:38.228 --> 20:41.690
One week of hard work, and I
already got my first blister.

20:41.815 --> 20:45.202
Maybe we take that <i>Playboy</i> out
of the bathroom for the summer.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.622
Looks like things are getting
too spicy for the pepper.

20:48.788 --> 20:50.332
Hey, that's my wife's saying.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.700
Your wife?

20:51.825 --> 20:53.501
That's the old Salsa Fresca slogan

20:53.626 --> 20:55.087
from, like, two Super Bowls ago.

20:59.215 --> 21:03.228
Well, it looks like
the Hulkster's work here is done.
