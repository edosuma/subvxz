WEBVTT

00:16.150 --> 00:18.319
TRY NOT TO BREAK
THAT THING.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.730
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
START WITHOUT ME.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.732
WELL, I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE ON TIME.

00:34.335 --> 00:37.438
- ( door opens )
- Paul: HI.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.872
READY FOR YOU NOW.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.874
BESS AND I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ALONE.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.211
Paul: SURE.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.679
OLIVER, YOU OKAY
FOR A FEW MINUTES?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.860
FUCK.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.496
( theme music playing )

01:21.682 --> 01:24.385
- WHAT?
- DON'T YOU WANT TO GIVE
PAUL YOUR BIG NEWS?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.720
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
SO WORKED UP ABOUT IT.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.656
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM?

01:31.392 --> 01:33.427
11:00 LAST NIGHT
BESS CALLS ME UP

01:33.527 --> 01:35.563
AND TELLS ME
SHE'S MOVING UPSTATE.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.598
I GOT A JOB OFFER.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.967
TWO WEEKS FROM NOW
SHE'S GONNA PACK UP MY SON
AND TAKE HIM AWAY.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.436
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT.
I'M NOT TRYING TO KIDNAP HIM.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.438
SHE DUMPS THIS ON ME,
NO CHANCE TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.874
I TRIED TO TALK
TO HIM ABOUT IT,
AND HE HUNG UP ON ME.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.843
AND WHEN I TRIED TO
CALL HIM BACK, HE WOULDN'T
PICK UP THE PHONE.

01:49.943 --> 01:54.948
BESS, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE JOB OFFER?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.785
WHILE MICHELLE AND I
WERE ON VACATION,

01:57.885 --> 02:00.721
WE VISITED A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO'S A PROFESSOR
AT BARD COLLEGE.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.857
TURNS OUT,
ONE OF THEIR ADJUNCTS
IN THE ART HISTORY DEPARTMENT

02:03.957 --> 02:05.959
IS GOING ON EMERGENCY
MEDICAL LEAVE

02:06.059 --> 02:08.862
AND THEY NEED
SOMEBODY TO FILL IN...
STARTING IN TWO WEEKS.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.832
SEE? SHE'S KNOWN ABOUT THIS
FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW,

02:11.932 --> 02:15.369
BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
TILL SHE'D ALREADY MADE
ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.305
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
UNTIL I KNEW FOR SURE.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.941
I FIGURED, WHAT'S THE POINT
IN HAVING A FIGHT IF THERE'S
NOTHING TO FIGHT ABOUT?

02:21.041 --> 02:22.743
BESS, I'M SURE
YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND

02:22.843 --> 02:27.014
HOW LUKE MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE
CONFUSED ABOUT THIS.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.982
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM

02:29.082 --> 02:31.585
THAT YOU WERE SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING LEAVING THE CITY,

02:31.685 --> 02:34.988
AND THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING
TO IMPACT UPON HIS LIFE,

02:35.088 --> 02:37.925
BUT ESPECIALLY
ON OLIVER'S.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.828
DID YOU ALREADY
TELL OLIVER ABOUT THIS?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.064
NO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T TELL HIM.
I WANTED TO DISCUSS IT
WITH YOUR FIRST.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.901
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.239
AND IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH,
I WAS AFRAID TO TELL YOU
ABOUT IT TILL NOW,

02:51.339 --> 02:53.341
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU WOULD GET UPSET,

02:53.441 --> 02:57.177
AND THEN I WOULD PROBABLY
BACK DOWN AND GIVE UP.
AND I WASN'T GONNA RISK THAT.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.146
CAN I ASK YOU

02:59.247 --> 03:02.716
WHY THIS JOB IS
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

03:02.816 --> 03:07.821
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE
LIKE THIS EVERY DAY.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.858
AND IN THE FALL
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE ON
ANOTHER GRADUATE FELLOW.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.228
AND IF I DO WELL,
THAT MEANS I CAN FINALLY
FINISH MY DEGREE.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.096
SO YOU MIGHT STAY
UP THERE?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.400
IS IT NECESSARY
FOR YOU TO MOVE
UPSTATE?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.635
I'M TAKING YOUR ADVICE.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.738
YOU TOLD ME I'VE BEEN USING
OLIVER AS A WAY TO HIDE,

03:24.838 --> 03:28.909
THAT HE'S MY EXCUSE
FOR NEVER FINISHING
ANYTHING.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.711
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
THE EFFECT

03:30.811 --> 03:33.681
THAT LEAVING THE CITY
WILL HAVE ON OLIVER?

03:33.781 --> 03:36.417
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN THROUGH
A TREMENDOUS UPHEAVAL.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.419
NO, WAIT.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.021
THIS IS A HUGE
DOUBLE STANDARD.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.757
IF LUKE WAS OFFERED
A JOB OUT OF TOWN,
WOULD YOU BE TELLING HIM

03:43.857 --> 03:46.794
THAT HE'S GOT TO GIVE IT UP,
HE'S GOT TO STAY HOME
AND TAKE CARE OF OLIVER?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.630
SHE'S JUST USING THIS JOB
AS AN EXCUSE TO TAKE MY SON
AWAY FROM ME FOR GOOD.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.899
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT AT ALL!
- ONCE SHE TAKES HIM UPSTATE,

03:51.999 --> 03:54.101
I'LL ONLY
SEE HIM ON THE WEEKENDS,
AND THAT'S IF I'M LUCKY.

03:54.201 --> 03:57.170
- IF YOU'D ACTUALLY
LET ME EXPLAIN-
- SHE WANTS HIM ALL FOR HERSELF.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.372
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.775
I AGREE WITH YOU
ABOUT OLIVER.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.778
I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE
TO MOVE HIM UP THERE
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.315
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU LAST NIGHT

04:07.415 --> 04:10.017
WHEN YOU HUNG UP ON ME.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.120
I THINK OLIVER SHOULD
STAY HERE

04:13.220 --> 04:15.689
AND LIVE WITH YOU.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.496
LIVE WITH ME?

04:34.174 --> 04:37.745
( exhales )
I THINK IT WOULD BE
AWFUL TO UPROOT HIM

04:37.845 --> 04:40.481
MORE THAN HALFWAY
THROUGH THE SCHOOL YEAR.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.982
PLUS I DON'T KNOW YET

04:42.082 --> 04:44.518
IF THIS JOB'S GOING TO TURN
INTO SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT.

04:44.618 --> 04:48.856
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
SUGGESTING, BESS?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.658
THE BEST PLAN IS
FOR OLIVER

04:50.758 --> 04:53.226
TO LIVE WITH LUKE
UNTIL JUNE.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.729
THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT
THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.332
SO YOU'RE PLANNING TO JUST
RUN AWAY AND LEAVE HIM HERE?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.401
FIVE MINUTES AGO YOU
ACCUSED ME OF KIDNAPPING HIM.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.236
NOW YOU'RE SAYING
THAT I'M ABANDONING HIM?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.906
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE WHY LUKE
MIGHT BE CONFUSED.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.542
I MEAN, WHEN YOU STARTED
COMING HERE AT FIRST,

05:08.642 --> 05:12.012
YOU WERE NERVOUS
ABOUT LETTING OLIVER
STAY OVER ONE NIGHT.

05:12.112 --> 05:16.484
NOW YOU WANT HIM TO LIVE
THERE UNTIL JUNE AT LEAST.

05:16.584 --> 05:20.454
I REALIZE I'VE BEEN
TOO POSSESSIVE OF OLIVER.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.056
AND I CAN SEE NOW THAT I'VE
BEEN OVERLY CRITICAL OF LUKE.

05:23.156 --> 05:27.461
- YOU FINALLY FIGURED THAT OUT?
- LUKE, PLEASE, LET'S NOT
DO THAT.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.598
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT I THINK

05:30.698 --> 05:33.601
THE BEST THING FOR OLIVER
IS FOR ME TO STEP BACK

05:33.701 --> 05:35.369
AND LET HIM SPEND SOME
MORE TIME WITH HIS FATHER.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.438
NOW THAT YOU'RE FINISHED
SCREWING HIM UP,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.907
YOU'RE GONNA DUMP HIM ON ME?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.575
I DON'T GET THIS.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.378
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIM.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.414
LUKE, I'M NOT SURE
THAT BESS UNDERSTANDS

05:46.514 --> 05:50.384
WHY YOU'VE HAD SUCH A CHANGE
OF HEART ABOUT THIS.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.887
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO TAKE HIM ON FULL-TIME
RIGHT NOW.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.290
YOU JUST SPENT
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS TAKING
CARE OF HIM BY YOURSELF.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.026
YEAH, AND WE NEARLY
KILLED EACH OTHER.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.128
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:01.228 --> 06:04.031
YOU LEAVE THE TWO OF US ALONE
IN THE SAME APARTMENT AGAIN,

06:04.131 --> 06:07.435
BY JUNE YOU'RE GONNA BE
DRAGGING OUR BODIES
OUT OF THE HUDSON.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.103
Paul:
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT YOU AND OLIVER

06:10.203 --> 06:13.040
HAVE HAD A ROUGH
COUPLE OF WEEKS.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.842
BUT IN THE LAST FEW SESSIONS

06:14.942 --> 06:17.945
DIDN'T YOU FEEL THAT WE WERE
MAKING REAL PROGRESS?

06:20.448 --> 06:23.917
IT JUST ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.855
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNFAIR.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.458
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST
12 YEARS OF MY LIFE

06:30.558 --> 06:32.693
TAKING CARE OF HIM
PRACTICALLY ALL BY MYSELF.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.996
AND NOW I FINALLY HAVE
A CHANCE TO GET A LIFE
OF MY OWN GOING,

06:36.096 --> 06:37.731
AND THEN YOU SAY
I CAN'T DO IT.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.568
ALL I'M SAYING IS
I CAN'T BE WITH HIM
SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.903
SO WHAT, YOU THINK
IT'S BETTER TO JUST YANK
HIM OUT OF SCHOOL

06:43.003 --> 06:45.539
AND FORCE HIM
TO MOVE SOMEWHERE WHERE
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYONE?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.575
HE'S MISERABLE
AT HIS SCHOOL!

06:47.675 --> 06:49.810
HE'D BE MUCH
HAPPIER STARTING OVER
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.412
NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT
THINGS ARE NOW,

06:52.513 --> 06:55.115
THEY WILL BE MUCH WORSE
IF YOU FORCE HIM

06:55.215 --> 06:57.317
TO MOVE AWAY FROM HOME.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.953
HE DOESN'T CARE
WHAT OLIVER NEEDS.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.556
HE JUST DOESN'T WANT
TO MAKE THINGS INCONVENIENT
FOR HIMSELF.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.592
Paul:
SO WHAT ARE WE
SAYING HERE--

07:04.692 --> 07:09.497
THAT NEITHER
OF YOU WANTS TO TAKE CARE
OF OLIVER RIGHT NOW?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.513
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT BOTH OF YOU

07:25.613 --> 07:28.949
HAVE HAD A REALLY
TOUGH TIME OF IT LATELY.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.486
IT'S A HUGE TASK JUST
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELVES.

07:32.586 --> 07:36.089
BUT YOU HAVE GOT
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

07:36.189 --> 07:39.593
TO LOOK AFTER
YOUR SON.

07:45.633 --> 07:50.437
I KNOW MORE THAN ANYBODY
HOW MUCH ATTENTION HE NEEDS.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.573
AND I'M JUST ASKING
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS

07:52.673 --> 07:56.510
SO THAT I CAN GET
MY FEET ON THE GROUND.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.979
WELL, I CAN'T CUT
BACK ON MY HOURS AT WORK.
AND I CAN'T LEAVE OLIVER

07:59.079 --> 08:01.248
ALONE IN THE APARTMENT
EVERY WEEKNIGHT UNTIL 10:00.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.785
YOU NEED TO COME
TO A COMPROMISE HERE.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.387
YOU'RE BOTH
GONNA HAVE TO GIVE UP
SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT

08:07.487 --> 08:10.558
FOR THE SAKE
OF YOUR SON.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.603
UM...

08:22.703 --> 08:25.138
WHAT IF HE LIVES WITH YOU
DURING THE WEEK,

08:25.238 --> 08:29.943
THEN ON THE WEEKEND HE TAKES
THE TRAIN INTO THE CITY
AND STAYS WITH ME?

08:31.979 --> 08:35.348
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO TAKE
THE TRAIN BY HIMSELF.

08:35.448 --> 08:39.119
OKAY THEN,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.421
I COULD COME PICK HIM UP

08:41.521 --> 08:45.058
AND BRING HIM BACK
WITH ME.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.699
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA--

08:51.799 --> 08:55.736
TAKING HIM OUT OF SCHOOL,
MOVING HIM AWAY
FROM HIS HOUSE.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.537
I CAN'T TURN DOWN
THIS JOB.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.907
I'VE BEEN WAITING TOO LONG
FOR A CHANCE LIKE THIS.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.909
Luke:
I THINK BESS IS RIGHT.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.011
IT'S THE BEST THING
WE CAN DO.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.546
Paul:
I THINK IT'S
POTENTIALLY HARMFUL.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.749
IT'S ONLY
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

09:08.849 --> 09:12.586
AND IF IT TURNS OUT
TO BE A DISASTER,

09:12.686 --> 09:14.688
WE CAN COME UP WITH
SOMETHING ELSE, RIGHT?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.825
NOW WE'VE JUST GOT
TO BREAK IT TO THE KID.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.028
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN
TELL HIM JUST LIKE THAT.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.864
IT'S NOT THE KIND
OF DECISION THAT YOU CAN
MAKE IN 10 MINUTES.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.900
YOU BOTH HAVE TO SIT
AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.237
OTHERWISE, I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.673
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE TIME.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.675
I HAVE TO TELL THEM TODAY
IF I'M GONNA TAKE THE JOB.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.443
THEN I HAVE
TO PACK UP THE HOUSE.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.511
I THINK WE SHOULD
TELL HIM RIGHT NOW,

09:38.612 --> 09:40.914
WHILE WE'RE ALL HERE.

09:41.014 --> 09:45.753
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T SEE
ANY OTHER WAY?

10:01.268 --> 10:03.704
FINE.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.780
HEY, OLIVER,
COME ON IN FOR A SECOND.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.388
DO I HAVE TO?

10:21.488 --> 10:23.657
YOUR MOM AND DAD
WANT TO SAY

10:23.757 --> 10:26.093
JUST A COUPLE
OF THINGS TO YOU.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.829
ARE THEY STILL FIGHTING?

10:28.929 --> 10:30.731
NO, SWEETIE,
EVERYTHING IS OKAY NOW.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.266
DON'T WORRY, KIDDO.
NOTHING BAD IS
GONNA HAPPEN.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.770
YOU WANT
TO TAKE A SEAT?

10:52.886 --> 10:57.657
SO IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY
TO OLIVER?

10:59.860 --> 11:04.798
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
SOME REALLY
GOOD NEWS.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.867
WHILE MICHELLE AND I
WERE ON VACATION,

11:06.967 --> 11:08.702
WE RAN INTO THIS
OLD FRIEND OF MINE,

11:08.802 --> 11:11.739
AND HE OFFERED ME A JOB.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.175
IS THAT WHY YOU WERE
GONE SO LONG?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.510
PARTLY.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.413
ANYWAY, IT'S A REALLY
EXCELLENT JOB.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.582
I'M GOING TO BE TEACHING

11:22.682 --> 11:24.617
AT THIS SCHOOL
CALLED BARD COLLEGE.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.920
IT'S ONLY 2 1/2 HOURS
NORTH OF THE CITY.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.422
YOU'RE MOVING AWAY
FROM BROOKLYN?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.025
WELL, THAT'S
THE EXCITING PART,

11:32.125 --> 11:34.694
BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE GOING
TO LIVE UP THERE TOGETHER,

11:34.795 --> 11:37.330
AT LEAST
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.532
AND IF WE BOTH
LIKE IT,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.869
WE MIGHT EVEN
DECIDE TO STAY.

11:44.772 --> 11:48.041
THEY ALREADY HAVE A REALLY
NICE APARTMENT FOR US.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.611
IT'S ON THE EDGE OF THIS
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL FOREST.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.181
WHERE AM I GONNA
GO TO SCHOOL?

11:54.281 --> 11:56.383
UP THERE.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.886
YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

11:58.986 --> 12:03.356
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE
THE SCHOOL YOU'RE AT NOW.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.926
SO IT'LL BE
A FRESH START.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.768
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO OUR REAL APARTMENT?

12:16.469 --> 12:19.006
WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY
SOMETHING YOUR FATHER AND I

12:19.106 --> 12:21.641
HAVEN'T DISCUSSED YET.
BUT MY GUESS IS

12:21.741 --> 12:24.144
WE'LL SUBLET IT
FOR THE TIME BEING.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.513
IS SOMEONE ELSE
GONNA LIVE IN MY ROOM?

12:26.613 --> 12:27.981
MAYBE,

12:28.081 --> 12:30.884
BUT ONLY
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.522
WHAT ABOUT
ALL MY STUFF?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.624
YOU'LL TAKE
SOME OF IT UPSTATE

12:37.724 --> 12:39.692
AND LEAVE SOME
WITH ME,

12:39.793 --> 12:43.897
AND WE'LL PUT
THE REST IN STORAGE.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.899
EVERYTHING WILL BE SAFE.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.236
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA BE?

12:49.336 --> 12:50.938
I'M STAYING HERE.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.906
BUT I'LL COME VISIT.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.108
OR I'LL COME
PICK YOU UP

12:55.208 --> 12:58.478
AND WE'LL SPEND
WEEKENDS IN THE CITY.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.952
OLIVER, WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SAY

13:05.052 --> 13:07.687
TO YOUR MOM AND DAD?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
I DON'T WANT TO GO!

13:11.992 --> 13:14.761
LISTEN, KIDDO, I KNOW
THIS IS A LOT TO ASK,

13:14.862 --> 13:19.299
AND I KNOW WE'VE
ASKED A LOT ALREADY,

13:19.399 --> 13:21.768
BUT THIS IS THE WAY
IT HAS TO BE RIGHT NOW.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.336
YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT I THINK?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.538
BABY, OF COURSE WE CARE
WHAT YOU THINK,

13:25.638 --> 13:28.008
AND I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
REALLY REALLY HARD ON YOU,

13:28.108 --> 13:30.944
BUT THIS IS THE BEST
POSSIBLE SOLUTION.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.481
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

13:34.581 --> 13:39.186
OLIVER, THIS IS AN AWFUL LOT
FOR YOU TO TAKE IN,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.454
BUT I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT

13:41.554 --> 13:44.057
THAT YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU NEED.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.826
I DON'T WANT TO GO!
TELL THEM THEY CAN'T
DO THIS!

13:46.927 --> 13:48.695
I KNEW THIS WAS
AN AWFUL IDEA.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.663
IF YOU WOULD JUST
MOVE BACK TO BROOKLYN,

13:50.763 --> 13:52.966
THEN HE COULD GO
TO HIS REAL SCHOOL
AND STAY IN HIS REAL HOUSE.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.303
MOVE BACK INTO OUR
OLD APARTMENT? WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.705
I HATE STAYING WITH DAD.
I WON'T STAY WITH DAD.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.207
BABY, I KNOW YOU DON'T
ALWAYS GET ALONG,

14:00.307 --> 14:01.942
BUT YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T HATE EACH OTHER.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.743
HE YELLS AT ME.
HE GETS DRUNK.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.913
I DON'T WANT
TO STAY WITH HIM.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.215
YOU GET DRUNK
WHILE HE'S STAYING
WITH YOU?

14:08.315 --> 14:10.750
THAT'S WHY
HE CAN'T LIVE WITH ME.
IT'S ALL A FUCKING TRAIN WRECK.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.953
SO WHAT THEN? I HAVE
TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME

14:13.053 --> 14:15.388
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE
A FUCKING RESPONSIBLE
FATHER FOR TWO SECONDS?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.824
- STOP IT!
- ENOUGH!

14:17.925 --> 14:20.627
THAT'S IT.
NO MORE FIGHTING.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.663
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS KID.

14:23.763 --> 14:25.798
OF COURSE.

14:25.899 --> 14:29.669
OLIVER, YOU KNOW THAT
WE LOVE YOU VERY VERY MUCH.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.139
DON'T WORRY, KIDDO.
THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.241
FUCK YOU!
FUCK YOU!

14:37.978 --> 14:40.981
OLIVER.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.679
Luke:
OLIVER, CAN WE COME INSIDE
AND TRY TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

15:12.779 --> 15:14.647
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ANYBODY.

15:14.747 --> 15:18.785
OLIVER, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE OFFICE

15:18.885 --> 15:21.654
AND WE CAN TALK
EVERYTHING THROUGH, OKAY?

15:24.191 --> 15:25.925
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING FIRST.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.329
SURE.
SURE.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.965
ALONE.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.170
AT LEAST PUT YOUR JACKET ON
FOR ME, OKAY?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.579
YOUR DAD AND I WILL BE
RIGHT OVER THERE

15:46.679 --> 15:49.316
IF YOU WANT
TO TALK, OKAY?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.634
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

16:07.734 --> 16:11.104
WHERE AM I GONNA LIVE?

16:13.840 --> 16:15.742
( sighs )

16:15.842 --> 16:18.378
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.048
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.050
MY MOM AND DAD
DON'T WANT ME.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.486
THAT'S NOT
HOW THEY REALLY FEEL.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.058
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT MARRIED ANYMORE

16:31.158 --> 16:35.228
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GONNA
STOP BEING YOUR PARENTS.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.630
( sighs )

16:37.730 --> 16:39.866
IF I WAS GONE,

16:39.966 --> 16:44.003
MY MOM COULD GO AWAY
AND START HER NEW JOB,

16:44.104 --> 16:48.041
MY DAD COULD
LIVE ALONE.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.643
EVERYBODY
WOULD BE HAPPY.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.780
YOUR MOM AND DAD--
THEY'RE FRUSTRATED
RIGHT NOW.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.950
THEY'RE--
YEAH, THEY'RE ANGRY.

16:58.051 --> 17:02.689
AND THEY'RE GOING
THROUGH A TOUGH TIME.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.491
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER

17:04.591 --> 17:08.027
THEY STILL
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.431
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.534
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
LET'S TRY AN EXPERIMENT.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.470
LET'S TRY AND THINK
OF ALL THE THINGS

17:17.570 --> 17:19.172
THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY,

17:19.272 --> 17:23.009
ALL THE THINGS THAT
MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.178
I'M COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR OFFICE.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.314
WELL, I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.750
WHAT IS IT ABOUT MY OFFICE
THAT MAKES YOU COMFORTABLE?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.953
I LIKE TALKING TO YOU.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.324
AND I LIKE TALKING
TO YOU TOO.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.600
CAN I COME
LIVE WITH YOU?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.944
YOU KNOW, OLIVER,

17:58.044 --> 18:01.348
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A REALLY--

18:01.448 --> 18:03.716
A REALLY GOOD IDEA,
BUT I--

18:03.816 --> 18:05.885
REMEMBER YOU MADE ME
A SANDWICH

18:05.985 --> 18:08.054
AND YOU TOOK CARE
OF MY TURTLE?

18:08.155 --> 18:12.159
LOOK, WE HAVE
A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.796
BUT...

18:16.896 --> 18:18.831
YOU CAN'T COME
AND LIVE WITH ME.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.333
I'D BE AT SCHOOL ALL DAY.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.102
AND MY SCHOOL IS REALLY CLOSE
TO YOUR OFFICE. IT'D BE FUN.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.238
I KNOW, IT WOULD BE FUN
FOR ME TOO, BUT--

18:25.338 --> 18:27.207
I DON'T EVEN NEED
MY OWN BED.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.376
I CAN SLEEP
ON YOUR COUCH.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.179
BUT YOU HAVE PARENTS
OF YOUR OWN,

18:32.279 --> 18:36.649
AND THEY LOVE YOU,

18:36.749 --> 18:41.254
AND THEY WANT YOU
TO BE WITH THEM.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.223
BUT I LIKE YOU BETTER.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.092
I CAN NEVER TAKE THE PLACE
OF YOUR PARENTS.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.361
BUT YOU CAN COME VISIT ME
ANYTIME AT MY OFFICE--

18:48.461 --> 18:49.696
ANYTIME.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.265
AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.

18:52.365 --> 18:56.569
YOU KNOW LAST WEEK
WHEN I RAN AWAY FROM SCHOOL?

18:56.669 --> 18:59.772
I CAME TO YOUR OFFICE
INSTEAD OF GOING TO
MY MOM'S OR MY DAD'S.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.776
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE THEM.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.246
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

19:06.346 --> 19:10.550
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.919
IF YOU WERE REALLY MY FRIEND,
YOU'D LET ME COME LIVE WITH YOU.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.889
OLIVER, I PROMISE YOU
I WILL ALWAYS BE
YOUR FRIEND.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.926
AND--

19:25.232 --> 19:28.301
- YOU DON'T WANT ME EITHER.
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.606
LOOK, I KNOW THAT--

19:33.706 --> 19:37.777
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
REALLY UPSETTING FOR YOU.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.612
IT WAS A STUPID IDEA.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.449
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
A REALLY COOL IDEA.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.419
AND IT MAKES ME
VERY HAPPY

19:46.519 --> 19:49.989
THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
TALKING TO ME.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.158
YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

19:52.259 --> 19:55.061
WOULD YOU AT LEAST
LET ME TRY?

19:55.161 --> 19:56.996
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.099
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY--

20:00.199 --> 20:02.134
EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP

20:02.235 --> 20:04.371
SOME TIME
IN THEIR LIVES.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.548
OKAY.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.724
I UNDERSTAND.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.695
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

20:28.795 --> 20:34.867
THAT WHENEVER YOU NEED
TO TALK TO ME, I'M HERE.

20:34.967 --> 20:38.905
YOU WANT ME
TO TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD
YOU'RE READY TO GO?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.408
NO, I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.976
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.478
ARE YOU SURE?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.680
I DON'T CARE.
I'M MOVING NEXT WEEK

20:47.780 --> 20:50.383
AND I'M NEVER GONNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.988
OLIVER.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.891
OLIVER.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.663
I'M SORRY.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.824
( theme music playing )
