The World is Quiet Here?

01:56.833 --> 01:58.291
[Lemony]  After a great deal of time

01:58.375 --> 02:01.416
examining oceans,
investigating rainstorms,

02:01.500 --> 02:04.333
and staring very hard
at several drinking fountains,

02:04.416 --> 02:08.666
the scientists of the world developed
a theory called "the water cycle."

02:08.750 --> 02:11.583
The water cycle consists
of three key phenomena...

02:11.666 --> 02:14.416
evaporation, precipitation,
and collection.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.875
All of them are equally dry,
a word which here means "boring."

02:20.166 --> 02:22.625
Sometimes it is a relief to be bored

02:22.708 --> 02:24.541
because when one is bored...

02:25.541 --> 02:26.875
one is also safe.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.916
My name is Lemony Snicket,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.208
and I, myself, wish that I were studying
something dry like the water cycle

02:36.291 --> 02:39.416
instead of the lives
of the Baudelaire orphans,

02:39.500 --> 02:44.083
which are neither dry as in boring
nor dry as in lacking ocean.

02:44.166 --> 02:49.708
But I advise you to find
some safe, dry piece of entertainment,

02:49.791 --> 02:53.375
rather than watching another second
of this danger-filled,

02:53.458 --> 02:55.875

03:40.458 --> 03:41.833
Look at all this equipment.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.958
Look at these tidal charts. I think
the submarine is searching for something.

Welcome to the  Queequeg,  Baudelaires.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.666
Shiver me timbers!

03:57.458 --> 03:59.916
That's an expression pirates use
when they're surprised.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.875
Are you a pirate?

04:01.500 --> 04:06.541
No, but I am surprised to find
Klaus, Violet, and Sunny Baudelaire

04:06.625 --> 04:08.791
-in the middle of the ocean.
-How do you know who we are?

04:08.875 --> 04:11.458
And  The Daily Punctilio
says that you're dangerous murderers.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.708
Well, you can't always believe
what you read in the newspaper.

04:15.791 --> 04:17.041
So you're not dangerous?

04:20.541 --> 04:21.416
I, uh...

04:21.916 --> 04:23.208
We've had our...

I'm the captain of this sub.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.541
-You?
-You think a girl can't man a submarine?

04:36.625 --> 04:38.541
No, of course she can.
You're just so young.

04:38.625 --> 04:39.541
I'm old enough.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.250
I haven't been captain for long.

04:41.958 --> 04:45.041
That's my stepfather,
the original Captain Widdershins.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.041
He's gone now.

04:46.791 --> 04:47.875
We're orphans too.

04:47.958 --> 04:48.958
My stepfather's not dead.

04:49.041 --> 04:52.458
He left one day to answer a distress call
from a manatee and never came back.

04:52.958 --> 04:53.791
Well, we're sorry--

04:53.875 --> 04:55.708
He's out there.
He'll find me. I know he will.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.458
Well, we're glad you found us.
We got a message from V.F.D.

04:58.541 --> 05:00.916
saying there was a meeting
at the Last Safe Place on Thursday.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.958
Our friend might be there.
Can you take us?

05:03.041 --> 05:04.000
I'm already on a mission.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.250
Then can you take us to shore?

05:07.333 --> 05:10.125
I can't just change course
in the middle of a mission! Sorry.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.791
It's been hard running the submarine
on my own, but V.F.D. is counting on me.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.416
Well, what if you weren't on your own?

05:15.500 --> 05:18.333
If we helped with your mission,
you could take us to the Last Safe Place.

05:18.416 --> 05:20.875
Klaus, there's no time.
The meeting's on Thursday.

05:20.958 --> 05:22.916
-That's still a few days away.
-You'd volunteer?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.250
That's what V.F.D. is for.

05:25.791 --> 05:27.875
Klaus, we don't even know
what this mission is.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.500
Only the most important mission
in V.F.D. history.

05:36.541 --> 05:38.583
[Lemony]
The expression "shiver me timbers"

05:38.666 --> 05:43.000
comes from the society of pirates
who enjoy using interesting expressions

05:43.083 --> 05:45.375
almost as much as jumping aboard
other people's ships

05:45.458 --> 05:46.916
and stealing their valuables.

05:47.416 --> 05:52.166
It is an expression of extreme amazement
they used in circumstances

05:52.250 --> 05:56.958
when one feels as if one's very bones,
or timbers, are shivering.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.291
I have not used it since one rainy night

05:59.375 --> 06:03.125
when it was necessary to pose as a pirate
experiencing amazement.

06:03.208 --> 06:07.083
But there is one occasion
when it is always appropriate,

06:07.166 --> 06:09.666
and that is when you see Count Olaf.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.375
Shiver me timbers!

06:12.458 --> 06:13.750
That's a pirate expression

06:13.833 --> 06:16.833
that means put on these disguises
and do what I tell you.

06:17.416 --> 06:19.666
Now, the public still thinks
that I'm dead,

06:19.750 --> 06:22.583
so we have to be extremely careful
with what we say.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.666
Hello, I'm looking to steal a submarine.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.375
I mean, borrow a submarine.

06:27.458 --> 06:31.083
I mean, rent your finest
discount submarine.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.166
[Olaf] In case you were wondering,

06:33.250 --> 06:37.541
I'm just a typical family man
on vacation with my lovely wife--

06:37.625 --> 06:39.083
This muumuu is not very "in."

06:39.166 --> 06:42.083
-My handsome daughter--
-I'm not handsome! I'm adorable.

06:42.166 --> 06:46.000
-And a distant cousin who is dead to me.
-Is this because I didn't murder the baby?

06:46.083 --> 06:47.625
-I said I was sorry!
-Sh!

06:48.750 --> 06:50.916
He says the strangest things.

06:51.291 --> 06:54.541
As I was saying,
we're taking a family vacation

06:54.625 --> 06:56.791
to the bottom of the sea to hunt orphans,

06:56.875 --> 06:59.750
which is a normal activity
that many families do.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.833
Yep, just a normal family

07:09.250 --> 07:11.041
with an extensive backstory

07:11.125 --> 07:13.375
that I'm happy to share with you
if you have any questions,

07:13.458 --> 07:14.875
or if you've noticed that I resemble

07:14.958 --> 07:17.250
a certain dead count
that you read about in the paper.

07:17.333 --> 07:18.916
Esmé Squalor?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.416
No, that's not my name.

My name is some other thing
I haven't told you yet.

-Who's asking?
-Your submarine's ready.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.416
My submarine?

07:30.500 --> 07:31.583
Her submarine?

07:31.666 --> 07:33.041
Some couple arranged it.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.916
Our most terrifying submarine
for one Esmé Squalor.

07:36.458 --> 07:39.875
It was over the phone, but it sounded like
one of them had hair and no beard

07:39.958 --> 07:41.458
and the other had a beard and no hair.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.291
Real aura of menace.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.375
They prepaid.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.291
Both so thoughtful.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.791
Well, did they order anything else?
Maybe under the name Olaf?

07:48.875 --> 07:50.166
Just this captain's hat.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.958
-I'll take it!
-They said she was captain.

are making me feel uncomfortable.

07:59.625 --> 08:02.041
I'll make it up to you, boss.
Who do you want me to kill?

08:04.166 --> 08:07.958
Yep, just a normal, regular,
ordinary family.

08:08.541 --> 08:10.208
Your sub's the one with the tentacles.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.375
Oh!

08:21.833 --> 08:23.250
[Klaus] We heard about a sugar bowl.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.708
Esmé Squalor was searching for it
at the Heimlich Hospital.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.375
But one of our agents got to it first.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.250
She was taking it to V.F.D. headquarters
in the Mortmain Mountains.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.833
We went there. They burnt down.

08:31.916 --> 08:34.208
I know. And the sugar bowl
fell into Stricken Stream,

08:34.291 --> 08:35.541
where it was carried out to sea.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.791
That is why the  Queequeg
is the only hope of finding it.

08:37.875 --> 08:41.000
-What's so important about the sugar bowl?
-Both sides of the schism are after it.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.916
Some say it's the reason
for the schism itself.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.333
-What's in it?
-That's top secret.

08:44.416 --> 08:46.583
-You're not gonna tell us?
-It's on a need to know basis,

08:46.708 --> 08:47.958
and you don't need to know.

08:48.041 --> 08:49.958
I don't take orders
unless I know the facts.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.666
How about we all just focus on finding it,

08:51.750 --> 08:54.541
then we'll all know
what's inside the... sugar bowl.

08:54.625 --> 08:57.416
You sound like Cookie.
He's always saying cheery stuff like that.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.333
-Cookie?
-My other crewman.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.708
He's in charge of meals,
though his cooking's a little heavy

09:01.791 --> 09:04.250
-on the chewing gum.
-Hey, Cookie! Get out here!

09:12.958 --> 09:13.833

09:16.916 --> 09:18.208
Oh, what are you doing here?

09:18.291 --> 09:20.791

Ain't that right, Cookie?

09:20.875 --> 09:22.750
-His name is Phil.
-And I call him Cookie.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.000
Oh, I really don't mind
what people call me.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.250
I'm glad you got out
of that terrible lumber mill.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.875
I was sure I could find a better job
than "unpaid mill worker."

09:29.958 --> 09:34.166
And look at me now. I am a cook
on an understaffed submarine!

09:34.250 --> 09:35.500
[laughs]

09:35.583 --> 09:37.375
Life keeps getting better and better!

09:37.458 --> 09:39.916
Phil, I am so sorry
for causing that accident.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.916
-No, no, no. That healed ages ago!
-Then what happened to your leg?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.875
It was eaten by a shark. Yeah.

09:44.958 --> 09:46.625
It was extremely painful,

09:46.708 --> 09:47.750
but on the bright side,

09:47.833 --> 09:50.791
most people never get to see
such a dangerous animal up close.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.041
I can see you're still an optimist.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.166
What's for dinner, Cookie?

09:54.250 --> 09:57.625
I don't like to say anything bad about
anyone's cooking, even mine, so I won't.

09:57.708 --> 10:01.291
[chuckles]
Tonight's casserole is extremely chewy.

10:01.375 --> 10:03.125
-Chewy?
-It's just gum.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.000
[babbling]

10:05.083 --> 10:07.958
What my sister means is she recently
took up an interest in cooking.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.666
She'd be happy to help you in the kitchen.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.583
I'd appreciate that.
I have no idea what I'm doing! [laughs]

10:12.666 --> 10:14.125
We've got uniforms in the barracks.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.375
Once you suit up,
Sunny can join Cookie in the galley,

10:16.458 --> 10:17.833
while I show Klaus the library.

10:18.541 --> 10:20.083
I could use a dedicated researcher.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.500
-What can I do?
-Do you have any special skills?

10:22.583 --> 10:24.083
My sister's a mechanical genius.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.125
I wouldn't say "genius."

10:25.208 --> 10:28.208
Well, I'm pretty mechanically-minded
myself, so the boat's in ship-shape.

10:28.791 --> 10:30.750
-I see.
-My stepfather had a philosophy:

10:30.833 --> 10:32.541
"He who hesitates is lost."

10:32.625 --> 10:35.208
-So let's not hesitate, Baudelaires.
- Aye-aye.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.541
-Aye-aye!
-Aye-aye.

10:38.416 --> 10:40.708
"He who hesitates is lost"
isn't a very useful philosophy.

10:40.791 --> 10:43.166
There are plenty of times
where it's better to stop and think.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.500
Besides, it should be
"he or she who hesitates."

10:45.583 --> 10:47.625
I guess that's harder to fit on a plaque.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.458
[Violet sighs] We should hesitate now.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.166
We should try and find the Last Safe Place

10:51.250 --> 10:53.250
instead of floating around
looking for a sugar bowl.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.666
I think we can trust Fiona.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.875
I want to, but there's something about her
that rubs me the wrong way.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.041
Really?

10:59.125 --> 11:00.666
'Cause I think she's a lot like you.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.833
I know you're worried about Quigley,
but I'm sure he's safe.

11:03.916 --> 11:06.500
I know he is. Quigley's very resourceful.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.791
[spluttering]

11:07.875 --> 11:10.875
Young man, are you telling me that
you tobogganed down a frozen waterfall,

11:10.958 --> 11:13.833
fell into a stream when you were
separated from your friends,

11:13.916 --> 11:16.625
then made it back to the city
on skis you carved out of tree bark?

11:16.708 --> 11:19.208
[scoffs]
Frankly, I find that difficult to swallow.

11:19.291 --> 11:22.000
I mean, why not just call a cab?
And where are your parents?

11:22.083 --> 11:23.708
I'm an orphan. My friends are orphans too.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.208
That's why I came
to the Department of Orphan Affairs.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.541
-[phone rings]
-Excuse me.

11:29.041 --> 11:29.875
Yes?

11:30.875 --> 11:31.708
Yes.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.208
No.

11:33.958 --> 11:34.791
No.

11:37.416 --> 11:38.458
The color puce.

11:39.708 --> 11:41.375
[laughs] No, thank you.

11:42.625 --> 11:43.458
Hm.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.000
You were saying?

11:45.083 --> 11:46.708
Are you gonna help me
find my friends?

11:46.791 --> 11:49.208
I'm sorry, but I simply don't have
the time to look for orphans

11:49.291 --> 11:50.625
who lack the good sense to stay put.

11:50.708 --> 11:54.208
Why, the Baudelaire case alone has
chapped my lips too many times to count!

11:54.291 --> 11:56.041
And don't get me started
about the Quagmires.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.583
I'm looking for the Baudelaires.
I'm Quigley Quagmire.

11:58.666 --> 12:00.708
That's impossible.
Quigley Quagmire died in a fire,

12:00.791 --> 12:02.458
which seems to be going around.

12:02.541 --> 12:05.041
Now, my new secretary
will help you find the door.

12:05.375 --> 12:06.833
-[buzzing]
-Jacqueline?

12:07.791 --> 12:08.958
Jacqueline!

12:09.625 --> 12:10.583
I am not the secretary,

12:10.666 --> 12:13.750
and my name is not Jacqueline,
but I might be able to help you.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.875
This sounds
like a Viciously Fraught Dilemma.

12:26.958 --> 12:31.541
For years, people have called me
a villain and a criminal.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.875
They've trembled at my every wicked deed.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.125
But I never understood until now

12:38.208 --> 12:40.750
just how terrifying it is
to be under the control

12:40.833 --> 12:44.208
of a villainous, treacherous,
tyrannical, traitorous,

12:44.291 --> 12:46.625
super mean and really, really bossy--

12:47.250 --> 12:48.791
-Ow!
-Don't be such a baby.

12:48.875 --> 12:52.041
You're just mad because that nice couple
from the mountain like me better than you.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.125
That's why they bought me
this submarine and hat.

12:54.208 --> 12:57.291
A captain's hat
does not make you a captain!

12:57.791 --> 12:59.875
And it's a rental.

12:59.958 --> 13:03.416
-Olaf, are you in one of your moods?
-We should be hunting Baudelaires,

13:03.500 --> 13:07.291
not... not floating around
in this hunk of tin.

13:07.375 --> 13:10.416
Listen, mister. I supported you
when you wanted to chase your dream

13:10.500 --> 13:11.458
of chasing those orphans

13:11.541 --> 13:14.416
through some of the least "in" landscapes
in the hinterlands.

13:14.500 --> 13:18.125
This time, we are going after what I want.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.583
The sugar bowl.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.250
You're darn right, the sugar bowl.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.666
Besides, just think of this
as family time.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.291
[Carmelita] Look at me, Countie!

13:25.375 --> 13:27.625
Look at me! Look, Countie!

13:27.708 --> 13:28.583
[giggles]

13:28.666 --> 13:31.041
It's so important in these modern times

13:31.125 --> 13:33.666
-with everybody rushing around...
-Look! Look!

13:33.750 --> 13:35.041
...that families carve out time

13:35.125 --> 13:36.541
-to really be together.
-Look at me!

13:36.625 --> 13:38.000
Look at me, you cakesniffers!

13:38.083 --> 13:40.458
-[inhales]
-Darling, you look adorable!

13:40.541 --> 13:42.041
Doesn't she look adorable?

13:42.125 --> 13:45.708
I'm a tap-dancing-ballerina-
fairy princess-veterinarian!

13:46.333 --> 13:49.875
Next time, please ask
before you take disguises from my trunk.

13:49.958 --> 13:51.250
But Countie,

13:51.333 --> 13:54.083
I need a special outfit to rehearse
for my special tap-dancing-

13:54.166 --> 13:57.750
ballerina-fairy princess-
veterinarian recital!

13:58.125 --> 14:00.333
This number is called "Swan Lake,"

14:00.416 --> 14:02.500
where the swan gets run over

14:02.583 --> 14:04.958
because it thought
it was more adorable than me.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.791
-[giggles]
-Aww!

14:07.958 --> 14:12.250
[out of tune music plays]

14:13.250 --> 14:14.791
Oh! Oh!

14:16.458 --> 14:17.458
Woo!

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Woo!

14:19.083 --> 14:20.125
[tapping]

14:20.208 --> 14:22.416
[music continues]

14:23.333 --> 14:24.583
Where do you think you're going?

14:24.666 --> 14:26.208
To drown my sorrows,

14:26.625 --> 14:29.000
before I drown a fairy princess.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.041
Where have you been?

14:34.125 --> 14:37.458
Oh, sorry, boss. I had to swab the deck
and hang that picture of Captain Esmé

14:37.541 --> 14:38.666
before I started cooking.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.458
I miss the rest of the troupe.

14:40.541 --> 14:43.833
It's a little challenging being
the only crew member aboard the  Carmelita.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.541
I think we should keep
workshopping that name.

14:46.625 --> 14:48.041
Oh... Um, listen, boss,

14:48.125 --> 14:51.833
I know that you're upset about, you know,
what went down on the mountains.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.750
So I just wanted to let you know
that you can still  count  on me.

14:59.416 --> 15:02.541
I said "count"
because I made a little Countie face.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.000
-What is this?
-What? Oh, it's a chef's salad.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.458
It's full of different things
that are just chopped up and--

15:07.541 --> 15:08.666
Is there any beef in it?

15:08.750 --> 15:10.041
-It's vegetarian.
-Vege-what-who?

15:10.125 --> 15:12.375
"Vegetarian" means
there's no meat in it whatsoever.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.708
Ow, that's my favorite hook!

15:13.791 --> 15:15.375
You are my henchperson,

15:15.458 --> 15:17.875
a word which here means you work for me.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.416
So the next time
I ask you to toss a baby off a cliff,

15:20.500 --> 15:22.791
-I expect to hear one thing.
-Uh...

15:22.875 --> 15:24.166
"Splat."

15:24.750 --> 15:25.583
Yes!

15:29.708 --> 15:30.791
[gargles]

15:32.833 --> 15:34.000
Oh, no!

15:39.958 --> 15:41.916
Hello, sailors. Looking sharp.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.875
This is Herman Melville.
He's one of my favorite authors.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.875
I love the way he dramatizes
the plight of overlooked groups,

15:47.958 --> 15:49.708
like poor sailors and young people.

15:49.791 --> 15:51.208
I like his use of symbolism,

15:51.291 --> 15:54.583
like how Moby Dick is both a literal whale
and a metaphor for death.

15:54.666 --> 15:57.041
I could do without the sea captain
pursuing obsessive, bloody,

15:57.125 --> 15:58.166
single-minded revenge.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.958
-I'm not surprised.
-[laughs]

16:00.041 --> 16:02.250
But my favorite books are over here.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.083
Mycology, Your Cology,

16:04.583 --> 16:07.083
The Fungus Among Us,
The Mycological Gaze...

16:07.166 --> 16:08.625
This is books on mushrooms.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.291
-Are you a mycologist?
-I've always been interested in fungi.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.166
[babbling]

16:16.666 --> 16:18.666
-Where should we start?
-Well, a book on tidal charts

16:18.750 --> 16:21.250
might help us determine
where the currents carried the sugar bowl.

16:21.333 --> 16:22.875
Then we can calculate where it ended up.

16:22.958 --> 16:25.291
It would be easier to calculate
if we knew what was inside.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.000
And I told you that is confidential.

16:27.458 --> 16:30.375
So we can miss the V.F.D. gathering
for something we know nothing about.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.958
Without the sugar bowl,
there is no gathering. Now get to work.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.083
-But--
-I am the captain and that is an order!

16:37.625 --> 16:38.458
I...

16:39.750 --> 16:42.666
-Sorry, I--
-I'm gonna go check the sonar equipment.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.375
If that's okay with the captain.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.166
I don't know what came over me.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.541
It's okay. We've all been through a lot.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.750
It's just been hard without my stepfather.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.000
I'm under so much pressure.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.666
Well, that makes sense.
You're in a submarine.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.416
You know, you and Violet
are actually a lot alike.

17:01.791 --> 17:05.333
You're both pretty smart,
pretty strong-willed, pretty...

17:06.250 --> 17:07.708
pretty... uh...

17:07.791 --> 17:08.791
The truth is...

17:10.041 --> 17:12.958
my stepfather never told me
what was inside the sugar bowl.

17:13.041 --> 17:14.750
A captain's supposed to have
all the answers,

17:14.833 --> 17:16.791
but there's so much
he never told me about V.F.D.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.791
He said that some secrets are too terrible
for young people to know.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.375
[sighs] He drove my brother crazy.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.583
You have a brother?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.625
He died.

17:23.708 --> 17:24.541
In a fire?

17:24.625 --> 17:26.583
No. In a manatee accident.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.833
Well, our parents kept secrets
from us too.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.583
I think they were trying to keep us safe.

17:31.666 --> 17:34.500
Instead, we're facing dangers
they never prepared us for.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.083
Listen, Klaus. There's something
you should know about my family.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.333
Oh, I found it!  The Water Cycle.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.041
Sorry, you were saying?

17:46.625 --> 17:47.666
It's not important.

17:49.666 --> 17:50.750
[Sunny babbling]

17:51.250 --> 17:52.541
Boxes of gum!

17:52.625 --> 17:55.875
I raided the pantry at Lucky Smells
before I left.

17:55.958 --> 17:58.458
But we also have potatoes,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.666
all-purpose flour,

18:01.333 --> 18:03.708
cream, ground black pepper,

18:04.791 --> 18:05.625
and...

18:08.375 --> 18:09.208
cod.

18:09.291 --> 18:12.666
I know! We could make
a cod and gum casserole.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.333
Chowder with gum?
[laughs]

18:17.208 --> 18:19.833
You have a lot to learn about cooking,
little lady.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.708
Cod and potato chowder.

18:25.625 --> 18:26.833
That is brilliant!

18:26.916 --> 18:29.541
We don't have any butter,
but we do have olive oil.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.541
[high-pitched] "Adventurous cooking
often necessitates quick substitutions,"

18:37.208 --> 18:39.000
as my Auntie Julia used to say.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.375
You know, ordinarily, I would never let
a toddler peel potatoes, but...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.208
you seem like a natural!

19:00.375 --> 19:01.291
There you are.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.916
There was nothing onboard
that needed repairing,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.250
so I've been studying
the mechanics of this airlock.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.666
You put on these diving suits,
and the room fills with water,

19:08.750 --> 19:11.333
and then that hatch opens
so you can go out to explore.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.333
That might be useful.
We've made some progress.

19:13.416 --> 19:14.291
You and Fiona?

19:14.375 --> 19:15.500
You should give her a chance.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.625
The reason she didn't tell us
what's in the sugar bowl

19:17.708 --> 19:20.625
-is because she doesn't know.
-So she lied? What else is she hiding?

19:20.708 --> 19:22.291
She's on our side. She's V.F.D.!

19:22.375 --> 19:23.708
But what side of the schism?

19:23.791 --> 19:25.333
She seems pretty noble to me.

19:25.416 --> 19:28.333
A lot of people seem noble that aren't.
I don't trust her, Klaus.

19:28.416 --> 19:29.250
But I do.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.583
-Don't you trust me?
-Of course.

19:31.666 --> 19:33.666
Then just try to get along.

19:34.666 --> 19:36.583
Come on, we'll show you what we found.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.791
[Klaus] We assume the bowl
was carried downstream,

19:40.875 --> 19:42.083
and then was washed out to sea,

19:42.583 --> 19:45.083
where the tides carried it
in a northwesterly direction.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.958
-Did it sink?
-Oceans are in constant motion,

19:47.041 --> 19:50.458
so if an object falls into the sea,
then it'll end up miles away.

19:50.541 --> 19:53.291
The currents in this part of the ocean
would have carried the sugar bowl

19:53.375 --> 19:56.250
around the Mediocre Barrier Reef,
which would have carried it to here.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.666
-[Violet] It's marked "A.A."
-Anwhistle Aquatics.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.916
Anwhistle was our Aunt Josephine's
last name.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I know.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.625
Anwhistle Aquatics was a marine research
and rhetorical advice center.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.083
Her husband, Ike,
ran it with his brother, Gregor.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.583
Aunt Josephine never mentioned it.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.333
She never mentioned a lot of things.

20:11.416 --> 20:13.416
I'm not surprised
she never wanted to talk about it.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.125
Ike and Gregor had a terrible falling out.

20:15.208 --> 20:18.000
No one knew why,
but they never spoke to each other again.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.250
And then one day there was a fire.

20:21.791 --> 20:25.000
Anwhistle Aquatics burned down,
and Gregor Anwhistle was killed.

20:25.958 --> 20:26.958
[Violet] So the sugar bowl

20:27.041 --> 20:29.875
-is near the ruins of Anwhistle Aquatics?
-That's where it gets confusing.

20:29.958 --> 20:33.291
According to my calculations, the bowl
is under Anwhistle Aquatics, right here.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.333
[Violet] It's marked "G.G."

20:35.416 --> 20:36.583
The Gorgonian Grotto.

20:36.958 --> 20:40.416
-It's an underwater cave below the lab.
-So we'll set a course for the Grotto.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.500
-What?
-We shouldn't rush it.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.458
We don't know
if the calculations are correct.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.416
I thought she who hesitated was lost.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.125
Maybe this time, we should stop and think.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.291
[Violet] We can't stop.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.458
We have to make it to the Last Safe Place
by Thursday. We're running out of time!

20:54.541 --> 20:56.958
Klaus, tell your sister
she is being insubordinate!

20:57.041 --> 20:58.791
Tell your captain she's being absurd!

20:58.875 --> 21:00.583
-I... Let's--
-Soup's up!

21:01.208 --> 21:03.291
-Good timing, Phil.
-Don't thank me, thank Sunny.

21:04.333 --> 21:07.458
Her teeth came in real handy
dicing potatoes and deboning the fish.

21:07.541 --> 21:09.291
Smells delicious.

21:12.583 --> 21:13.875
Good work, you two.

21:15.583 --> 21:16.583
Good work, everyone.

21:18.625 --> 21:19.625
On the advice of my crew,

21:19.708 --> 21:23.458
I've decided to set sail for the Gorgonian
Grotto right away. Captain's orders.

21:23.541 --> 21:27.083
You see? There is no problem
that a family dinner can't solve.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.750
-Political injustice.
-Stomachache.

21:28.833 --> 21:31.208
-Complex math.
-I'm talking about real problems, guys!

21:31.291 --> 21:32.541
[laughing]

21:33.583 --> 21:34.416
[Hooky] It's lettuce.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.958
-And you're sure it's edible?
-That's what I said.

21:37.041 --> 21:39.291
I wanted a salad with pizzas inside.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.291
This one's a real snooze.

21:43.625 --> 21:44.500
Darling...

21:46.416 --> 21:47.875
[under breath] Say something.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.708
[muttering]

21:49.791 --> 21:51.666
Look, uh, Hooky...

21:51.750 --> 21:54.583
-Actually, you know, my name is--
-This is a family dinner.

21:54.666 --> 21:55.750
Aw!

21:55.833 --> 21:57.041
Thanks, boss.

21:58.416 --> 22:01.833
Last I checked, I had one
fabulously handsome, "in" partner.

22:01.916 --> 22:04.416
-That's  moi.
-And one adorably adopted,

22:04.500 --> 22:05.875
sickeningly talented daughter.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.458
A man, a woman, a child.

22:08.541 --> 22:09.875
That's a family.

22:09.958 --> 22:12.875
Actually, families take on
all sorts of shapes, like--

22:12.958 --> 22:15.833
What Esmé means is
go eat in the brig with the rats.

22:18.750 --> 22:19.791
Oh, um...

22:21.583 --> 22:22.500
Yes, boss.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.416
♪ The cakesniffer is not family! ♪

22:26.500 --> 22:29.208
♪ The cakesniffer is not family! ♪

22:29.291 --> 22:31.666
♪ The cakesniffer is not family! ♪

22:31.750 --> 22:34.333
♪ The cakesniffer is not family! ♪

22:34.416 --> 22:37.250
♪ The cakesniffer is not family! ♪

22:38.041 --> 22:40.125
[Fiona] We'll be at Anwhistle Aquatics
within the hour.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.375
Maybe you should tell us
what we're really getting into.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.541
-Violet, stop.
-There's something she's not telling us.

22:44.625 --> 22:46.625
That's why she hesitated.
What's down there?

22:47.416 --> 22:49.041
[sighs] The Medusoid Mycelium.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.583
Mycelium is a word for mushrooms.

22:51.916 --> 22:56.166
And Medusa is a monster from Greek
mythology. Her hair is made of snakes.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.416
I bet she was really nice
when you got to know her.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.833
The Medusoid Mycelium is a rare mushroom
that only grows in the grotto.

23:01.916 --> 23:03.750
One of my books has a poem about it.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.750
"A single spore has such grim power
that you may die within the hour."

23:07.833 --> 23:09.916
-So it's poisonous.
-And deadly.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.583
The mushroom waxes and wanes.
It appears and disappears in cycles.

23:13.666 --> 23:16.708
When it wanes, you might not even know
it's there, but when it waxes...

23:18.875 --> 23:21.458
The grotto isolates the fungus
so it cannot spread.

23:21.541 --> 23:24.125
If that's where the sugar bowl is...
If that's where we're headed...

23:24.791 --> 23:26.000
this mission could be doomed.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.166
[beeping]

23:28.250 --> 23:29.625
It's the sonar detector.

23:30.291 --> 23:32.041
[beeping continues]

23:35.166 --> 23:37.041
-Is that Q the  Queequeg?
-Aye.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.708
[Klaus] What's that question mark?

23:38.791 --> 23:40.750
-Maybe if we go dark, it won't see us.
-But--

23:40.833 --> 23:43.666
She who hesitates is lost. Shut off
the engines, lights, everything! Go!

23:46.166 --> 23:48.583
[beeping]

24:05.458 --> 24:07.083
[whispering] Get down. Get down!

24:12.666 --> 24:14.625
[crashing]

24:17.791 --> 24:18.791
[crashing]

24:37.375 --> 24:38.583
[crashing]

24:49.125 --> 24:50.625
[crashing]

24:55.166 --> 24:58.000
[beeping]

25:00.291 --> 25:01.708
[all sighing]

25:05.833 --> 25:06.750
What was that?

25:07.083 --> 25:08.916
Sailors called it The Great Unknown.

25:09.291 --> 25:11.333
Did you see it through the porthole?
It was enormous.

25:11.416 --> 25:14.375
That was nothing.
A few scales, a glimpse of skin.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.875
My stepfather used to say
there are things in the world

25:16.958 --> 25:19.541
more powerful
than human beings can fathom.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.000
Ancient, mysterious things.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.458
[switches clunking]

25:23.958 --> 25:25.583
The Great Unknown is one of them.

25:25.666 --> 25:28.208
Different cultures
call it by different names, but...

25:28.791 --> 25:31.291
it's always out there,
waiting in the darkness.

25:31.708 --> 25:34.375
Jacques Snicket's brother wrote
an account of it. It's in the library.

25:34.458 --> 25:36.125
We should read that,
in case it comes back,

25:36.208 --> 25:38.083
and any books you have
on the Medusoid Mycelium.

25:38.166 --> 25:39.833
-I'll get them.
-[Cookie] Please hurry back.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.583
You do not want to miss dessert.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.583
Sunny and I made something very special.

25:44.666 --> 25:45.958
[laughs]

25:46.041 --> 25:47.000
It's not gum, is it?

25:47.083 --> 25:48.208
It's a surprise.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.208
I wish you were here.

26:12.416 --> 26:16.500
The way sadness works is one
of the strange riddles of the world.

26:17.541 --> 26:20.041
If you have been stricken
with a great sadness,

26:20.125 --> 26:22.875
you may feel
as if you have been set aflame

26:22.958 --> 26:25.083
as the sadness spreads over your life,

26:25.166 --> 26:28.208
like smoke from an enormous fire.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.791
If the Baudelaires could laugh again,

26:30.875 --> 26:32.458
they might have found it funny to know

26:32.541 --> 26:35.125
that as they contemplated
their own sad history

26:35.208 --> 26:36.833
and the uncharted waters ahead,

26:36.916 --> 26:40.083
their worst enemy
was adrift in sadness too.

26:41.791 --> 26:43.291
I'll never laugh again.

26:44.458 --> 26:45.708
[exhales]

26:46.500 --> 26:47.416
[splutters]

26:47.500 --> 26:49.458
See? My lips can't even form the sound.

26:49.750 --> 26:53.833
All joy and mirth has been sucked
from my life like those...

26:54.791 --> 26:57.833
What are those parasitic things
that cling to you and suck your blood?

26:57.916 --> 26:58.958
Lachrymose leeches?

27:00.750 --> 27:02.041
Families.

27:02.125 --> 27:06.208
How the mighty have sunk...
sunk to the bottom of the sea.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.958
Without the Baudelaires to torment,
there is no light, no air,

27:10.041 --> 27:13.333
no prescription moisturizer
because someone forgot to pack it!

27:14.208 --> 27:15.458
Stop being depressing.

27:15.541 --> 27:16.875
It's depressing me.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.666
[snarling] Get over it.

27:18.750 --> 27:21.291
Life's the pits,
and you can't get what you want,

27:21.375 --> 27:23.875
no matter how handsome
and good-looking you are.

27:23.958 --> 27:25.166
But I'm adorable!

27:25.250 --> 27:26.416
Looks fade.

27:26.958 --> 27:29.541
-[whimpering]
-You're scaring our daughter!

27:29.625 --> 27:31.583
I know, and I still don't feel better.

27:34.125 --> 27:35.625
[beeping]

27:35.708 --> 27:37.083
[Olaf] I don't believe it.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.500
[Carmelita]
What is that cakesniffing shape?

27:40.583 --> 27:43.000
-It looks like a big comma.
-[Olaf] It's the Great Unknown.

27:43.083 --> 27:46.041
I thought that was a myth,
like gravity or inner beauty.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.166
Be quiet or it'll sense us!

27:47.250 --> 27:49.583
I don't have to be quiet.
I'm too adorable!

27:49.666 --> 27:50.541
Turn out the lights!

27:51.875 --> 27:53.208
[machines power down]

28:01.916 --> 28:03.125
[exhales]

28:03.833 --> 28:05.500
I'll tell Hooky to get us out of here.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.583
Hooky, get us out of here.

28:07.666 --> 28:08.500
Wait...

28:08.583 --> 28:09.666
[beeping]

28:12.958 --> 28:14.166
Is that a Q?

28:16.125 --> 28:16.958
What is that?

28:17.041 --> 28:18.250
[Klaus] It looks like...

28:21.291 --> 28:22.666
Quick, turn everything off again.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.875
Well, if it isn't the  Queequeg.

28:25.958 --> 28:27.291
That's Captain Widdershins' ship.

28:27.375 --> 28:30.250
Widdershins? That sounds
like a skin disease. Am I right?

28:30.333 --> 28:32.583
You're close. It's a volunteer.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.000
That old salt lick owes me fifty bucks!

28:35.583 --> 28:38.958
Plus, I bet he can tell us
where the Baudelaires are.

28:39.416 --> 28:42.458
Those volunteers are always
sending each other annoying telegrams.

28:42.541 --> 28:44.875
We are not after the Baudelaires!
We're after the sugar bowl.

28:44.958 --> 28:47.333
I remind you that I've been made
captain of this boat, not you.

28:47.958 --> 28:50.041
-Oh!
-Consider this a mutiny.

28:50.791 --> 28:53.000
-Full steam ahead!
-[whirring]

28:53.083 --> 28:54.583
[Klaus] It's coming straight at us.

28:56.916 --> 28:59.541
-[Violet] It's a submarine.
-[Klaus] A very strange submarine.

28:59.625 --> 29:01.125
Let's not stick around!

29:02.583 --> 29:04.166
[alarm blares]

29:06.791 --> 29:08.833
[Olaf] Ah, the thrill of the chase!

29:09.291 --> 29:10.875
I can feel my belly roil!

29:11.250 --> 29:13.458
That's the salad.
You can never trust green food.

29:14.875 --> 29:15.958
Ha!

29:16.041 --> 29:17.666
That's not the salad, my pet.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.541
That's a villainous laugh.

29:21.458 --> 29:23.375
Ha-ha-hi-ho.

29:26.125 --> 29:29.041
[Olaf] Ha-ha-hee-ho.

29:29.125 --> 29:31.208
Horticulture!

29:31.291 --> 29:33.250
Come to papa!

29:34.958 --> 29:36.000
[rattling]

29:37.166 --> 29:39.083
Oh, boy, this is exciting!

29:46.041 --> 29:49.041
[tapping]

29:51.500 --> 29:53.500
[alarm blares]

29:57.291 --> 29:58.791
[Olaf] Ha-ha-ha!

29:58.875 --> 30:00.083
Hee-hee!

30:00.166 --> 30:01.166
-Oh, no!
-It can't be!

30:01.250 --> 30:05.041
[Olaf] I'm splitting my sides!
I'm nauseous with mirth!

30:05.375 --> 30:07.625
I'm seriously considering
compiling a joke book

30:07.708 --> 30:10.333
from all the hilarious things
bouncing around in my brain!

30:10.416 --> 30:12.125
Ha-ha!

30:12.208 --> 30:13.875
If I do say so myself.

30:14.458 --> 30:15.666
Ha!

30:17.250 --> 30:18.916
[squeaking]

30:19.000 --> 30:21.833
When did you change?
We boarded the sub, like, right away.

30:21.916 --> 30:24.250
Oh, this? It's just something
I threw together.

30:24.333 --> 30:25.958
Oh, you look great.

30:27.833 --> 30:30.958
-Doesn't she?
-You're not Captain Widdershins.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.833
Oops.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.125
Sorry, kids.

30:38.125 --> 30:39.833
Well, well, well...

30:39.916 --> 30:41.166
[Esmé sighs]

30:41.250 --> 30:43.208
The Quagmires.

30:43.291 --> 30:46.166
-It's the Baudelaires, love.
-Who?

30:46.250 --> 30:47.541
You adopted us for a while.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.375
-Doesn't ring a bell.
-[Olaf] Hm.

30:49.458 --> 30:52.000
What a fortuitous turn of events.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.416
I was expecting to torture an old enemy

30:54.500 --> 30:57.041
until he revealed the location
of you orphans,

30:57.125 --> 31:00.708
but now I can skip the middleman
and simply torture you.

31:00.791 --> 31:02.291
Hee-hee-hi-ho.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.333
Ha ya, pickle ho.

31:04.416 --> 31:07.458
-Why are you making those noises?
-It's our new villainous laugh.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.041
It's very "in."

31:11.791 --> 31:13.291
There's nothing funny about villainy.

31:13.375 --> 31:16.750
Yes, well, comedy is subjective.
Higgledy-piggledy!

31:16.833 --> 31:18.416
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

31:18.500 --> 31:21.416
I thought you'd drowned
in Stricken Stream.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.208
[buzzing]

31:27.416 --> 31:28.541
I was heartbroken.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.458
You weren't heartbroken. You've tried
to murder us plenty of times.

31:31.541 --> 31:34.625
I was heartbroken because I'd planned
to slaughter you myself,

31:34.708 --> 31:36.583
after I got your fortune, of course.

31:36.666 --> 31:40.333
And pried the sugar bowl
from your cold, dead fingers or toes.

31:40.416 --> 31:42.625
Why would we hold a sugar bowl
with our toes?

31:43.250 --> 31:44.833
[whispering] Don't question me.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.041
[Olaf] Where is the old man, anyway?
I thought this was his sub.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.000
Captain Widdershins left

31:50.083 --> 31:52.625
to answer a distress call from a manatee
and never came back.

31:54.625 --> 31:57.583
That does check out.
He always had a thing for sea cows.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.958
But do you expect me to believe that
he would leave his sub with no captain?

32:02.416 --> 32:03.416
I'm the captain.

32:03.500 --> 32:06.333
You? Captain of a submarine?
I don't believe that.

32:06.416 --> 32:08.125
-Because I'm too young?
-Because you're a girl.

32:08.208 --> 32:10.375
Uh, you were a captain
not five minutes ago, love.

32:10.458 --> 32:11.750
[hissing] I am a woman.

32:12.291 --> 32:14.458
-[Olaf] You're coming with us, brats.
-What about me?

32:14.541 --> 32:18.041
Who are you again? Oh, never mind.
There's room in the brig for all of you.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.625
I get to see a brig?

32:19.708 --> 32:21.541
-Let's go, orphans.
-Sea monster!

32:21.625 --> 32:24.166
-Wait, what?
-How dare you call me that.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.291
Oh, man, running is super fun!

32:26.708 --> 32:28.625
[Esmé] I'll show you a sea monster!

32:28.708 --> 32:29.791
Take that!

32:29.875 --> 32:30.708
[crashing]

32:33.125 --> 32:35.416
Sorry, baby, but I can't let you get away
this time.

32:36.916 --> 32:39.625
[laughing] Lookee, Countie,
I caught a cakesniffer!

32:39.708 --> 32:42.666
You see, Baudelaires, I have a family too,

32:42.750 --> 32:45.166
only mine is better than yours

32:45.250 --> 32:47.208
because they do everything
I tell them to do,

32:47.291 --> 32:48.708
and they're alive.

32:48.791 --> 32:50.625
-Darling...
-Not now, my pet.

32:50.708 --> 32:54.166
-But darling, the sugar bowl--
-Yes, I know you want the sugar bowl!

32:54.250 --> 32:56.083
I'm going to find it for you, I promise.

32:56.166 --> 32:57.791
But darling!

32:59.041 --> 33:00.750
They already have.

33:05.791 --> 33:07.291
That's because this is scary.

33:08.083 --> 33:10.708
You will dive deep
and retrieve that sugar bowl!

33:11.208 --> 33:12.041
You hear me?

33:12.125 --> 33:14.708
I'm sure they can hear you, dear.
You're very, very loud.

33:14.791 --> 33:16.166
And I wouldn't try to escape.

33:16.250 --> 33:19.291
You're at the bottom of the ocean
and there's not much air in those suits.

33:19.375 --> 33:23.333
If you don't come back, you'll die,
and I don't want that, not yet.

33:23.833 --> 33:26.708
[Olaf] Let's have one more round
of villainous laughter, on the house.

33:26.791 --> 33:28.666
Ha-ha hostages!

33:28.750 --> 33:31.458
Hee-hee-hee antagonism!

33:31.541 --> 33:33.875
Cackle, cackle, cakesniffer!

34:05.083 --> 34:09.458
The phrase "uncharted waters" refers
to locations that do not appear on a map,

34:09.541 --> 34:12.041
but it can also describe
any place that is unknown.

34:12.958 --> 34:14.541
From the darkest depths of the sea...

34:16.583 --> 34:18.291
to one's own future,

34:18.375 --> 34:21.125
which cannot be known until it arrives.

34:27.791 --> 34:29.833
[Olaf] Widdershins, you old fool.

34:29.916 --> 34:32.125
You always picked the wrong side.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.416
-What do you think happened to him?
-He probably drowned.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.500
-You think?
-Or got himself eaten by sharks.

34:36.583 --> 34:38.166
No, that was me.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.083
[laughs]

34:39.166 --> 34:40.333
Classic Phil.

34:41.916 --> 34:46.000
Boss... you know, most submarines
have more than one crew member.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.250
So what? Most sailors
have more than no hands.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.416
No, I meant, maybe I should search
for stowaways.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.625
-That's not a bad idea, Hooky.
-Actually, my name is--

34:53.708 --> 34:56.208
Search the  Queequeg
from stern to other side.

34:56.291 --> 34:58.583
If you find any volunteers
or soft pretzels,

34:58.666 --> 35:00.333
bring them right to my mouth.

35:00.416 --> 35:01.375
Aye aye, Captain.

35:01.458 --> 35:03.083
I love soft pretzels!

35:11.208 --> 35:12.416
-[beeping]
-S...

35:13.333 --> 35:14.458
-[beeping]
-O...

35:14.875 --> 35:15.708
-[beeping]
-S.

35:15.791 --> 35:17.166
-[beeping]
-[Poe] S.O.S.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.541
That's what I ought to send!

35:18.625 --> 35:21.541
-I'm literally drowning in paperwork.
-[Kit] Figuratively.

35:22.041 --> 35:23.875
You're figuratively drowning in paperwork.

35:23.958 --> 35:25.916
Yes, I meant to say literally.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.791
It's all hands on deck here
at the Department of Orphan Affairs

35:28.875 --> 35:30.958
since those mysterious fires
created all those orphans.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.916
And if that weren't bad enough,
the orphans themselves have gone missing.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.958
That's why I'm so glad
you've agreed to become my secretary.

35:37.041 --> 35:39.958
I don't work for you, Mr. Poe.
I'm just here to use your telegraph.

35:40.041 --> 35:41.541
Well, I wish you'd reconsider.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.166
We offer partial-pay maternity leave.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.041
-[beeping]
-[screaming]

35:46.125 --> 35:48.625
Is that my boss? Is it my wife?
Is it the taxman?

35:48.708 --> 35:50.833
I meant to pay him,
but I got so busy making money.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.083
-It's for me.
-For you?

35:52.166 --> 35:54.083
Technically,
it's a Volunteer Factual Dispatch,

35:54.166 --> 35:56.250
which is a type of message
sent out to all the members

35:56.333 --> 35:58.125
of a particular organization
to which I belong,

35:58.208 --> 36:00.541
but I thought maybe
that was too confusing to explain.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.166
Yes. [laughs] Well...

36:03.833 --> 36:07.375
We'll discuss receiving personal
correspondences in the office tomorrow.

36:09.708 --> 36:13.166
[Fiona]  Sugar bowl in G.G., stop.
Mission compromised, stop.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.333
[beeping]

36:18.416 --> 36:20.208
[beeping]

36:20.291 --> 36:21.833
Come on! Come on!

36:26.708 --> 36:27.833
[Kit]  Sending help.

36:41.750 --> 36:42.583
[sighs]

36:43.000 --> 36:44.500
[footsteps]

37:01.541 --> 37:03.000
[beeping]

37:09.916 --> 37:11.666
[footsteps]

37:16.500 --> 37:17.791
[sighs]

37:19.083 --> 37:20.541
[gasps]

37:20.625 --> 37:22.791
It's me. How fast can you swim?

37:33.291 --> 37:36.000
As Klaus had predicted
by studying the tidal charts,

37:36.083 --> 37:39.958
the currents carried the Baudelaires
to the mouth of the Gorgonian Grotto.

37:40.875 --> 37:43.125
I remember a time when Anwhistle Aquatics

37:43.208 --> 37:46.583
was renowned as a marine research
and rhetorical advice center,

37:46.666 --> 37:50.208
and as the aquatic base
of a secret organization.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.000
The organization has waxed and waned
over the years,

37:54.083 --> 37:56.833
and since the schism,
many volunteers have lost dear friends,

37:56.916 --> 38:00.708
trusted associates, and beloved siblings.

38:04.291 --> 38:07.333
Anwhistle Aquatics, of course,
burned down in a fire,

38:07.416 --> 38:10.041
but the grotto beneath the lab remains

38:10.125 --> 38:12.458
so that anyone who ventures inside

38:12.541 --> 38:16.375
can see glimpses
of the organization's glorious history...

38:17.208 --> 38:19.333
before it fell into darkness.

38:30.750 --> 38:32.375
[Klaus] That must lead
to Anwhistle Aquatics.

38:32.458 --> 38:33.375
[Violet] And a way out.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.125
[Violet] Once we get the bowl,

38:35.208 --> 38:37.583
-we'll be able to escape to the surface.
-Not without Fiona.

38:37.666 --> 38:40.000
-Fiona can handle herself.
-We're not leaving her behind!

38:40.083 --> 38:41.958
We can talk about it
once we find the sugar bowl.

38:42.041 --> 38:43.500
[Violet] That's scientific equipment.

38:43.583 --> 38:46.416
[Klaus] V.F.D. must have been doing
experiments down here before the fire.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.583
[Violet] What kind of experiments?

38:51.791 --> 38:52.875
[Klaus] Did you find something?

38:53.708 --> 38:56.500
It's an old telegram.
A Volunteer Factual Dispatch.

38:56.583 --> 38:57.416
[Klaus] That's V.F.D.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.708
[Violet]
"Gregor: Please reconsider your project.

38:59.791 --> 39:02.000
You're playing with fire.
Don't make me do the same."

39:02.083 --> 39:03.583
It's signed "Fernald."

39:03.666 --> 39:04.666
Who's Fernald?

39:05.041 --> 39:06.583
And what project?

39:06.958 --> 39:07.916
I don't know.

39:09.166 --> 39:11.416
There's something sinister
about this place.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.750
Something bad happened here.
It's not just the fire.

39:16.458 --> 39:18.333
I'm sure my calculations were correct.

39:18.416 --> 39:20.416
I double-checked them,
and Fiona triple-checked them.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.125
[Violet] Look at this. I think they were.

39:22.583 --> 39:24.500
It looks like the sugar bowl was here.

39:25.458 --> 39:26.583
Those footprints are recent.

39:35.541 --> 39:36.750
-Hello?
-Is someone up there?

39:39.666 --> 39:40.958
[Quigley] Violet? Klaus?

39:41.541 --> 39:42.833
-Quigley?
-Quigley!

39:45.625 --> 39:46.708
What are you doing here?

39:46.791 --> 39:49.291
V.F.D. sent me. I got the sugar bowl!

39:49.375 --> 39:52.666
I've learned so much! When you get
up here, I'll tell you everything.

39:52.750 --> 39:53.708
Violet, stop!

39:53.791 --> 39:56.416
[gurgling]

39:57.458 --> 39:58.916
It's the Medusoid Mycelium.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.000
It's waxing!

40:05.625 --> 40:07.500
-What's going on?
-Violet, you have to come down.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.791
Violet!

40:11.083 --> 40:13.125
Violet, hurry! It's spreading towards you!

40:16.208 --> 40:17.708
Quigley, the mushrooms are dangerous!

40:17.791 --> 40:20.000
They're spreading up the stairs!
You have to go!

40:20.083 --> 40:21.416
No, not without you!

40:21.500 --> 40:23.583
-We'll meet you at the Last Safe Place.
-No!

40:23.666 --> 40:26.458
Count Olaf is expecting the sugar bowl.
Should Quigley throw it down?

40:26.541 --> 40:28.541
No. Whatever's inside
is safer away from Count Olaf.

40:31.416 --> 40:32.333
[Klaus] Shut the door!

40:32.708 --> 40:34.166
[Violet] Quigley, shut the door!

40:37.250 --> 40:38.583
[sighs]

40:45.625 --> 40:47.625
What do we tell Olaf
when we come back empty-handed?

40:47.708 --> 40:50.083
[Violet] If we don't go now,
we won't be alive to tell them.

40:50.166 --> 40:52.000
Come on. If we hesitate, we're lost.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.833
-I searched the sub.
-And?

41:01.916 --> 41:03.375
I didn't find anyone, boss.

41:03.458 --> 41:06.625
Well, thank you
for wasting everyone's time!

41:06.958 --> 41:08.750
Take the prisoner to the  Carmelita.

41:10.375 --> 41:12.041
[dinging]

41:12.125 --> 41:14.625
Oh, that must be the Baudelaires!

41:14.708 --> 41:16.166
[shrieking]

41:16.250 --> 41:17.958
Oh! Oh!

41:18.041 --> 41:20.000
I am so excited to get my hands
on that sugar bowl,

41:20.083 --> 41:21.291
I could chew off someone's arm!

41:21.375 --> 41:24.500
-I've still got two of ‘em!
-Come on! Show-off.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.291
[shrieking]

41:28.041 --> 41:31.875
One of the most powerful elements
not found on standard periodic tables

41:31.958 --> 41:34.000
is the element of surprise.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.875
-[tapping]
-Sugar bowl safe.

41:38.166 --> 41:39.500
Baudelaires in danger.

41:39.583 --> 41:42.916
The element of surprise
is found where you least expect it.

41:49.208 --> 41:50.916
But it is a dangerous element,

41:51.000 --> 41:54.916
which is why I recommend limiting one's
scientific studies to the water cycle.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.916
[Violet] I hope Quigley will be all right.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.583
I hope we'll be all right once
they discover we don't have the bowl.

41:59.666 --> 42:01.958
The water cycle consists
of three key phenomena:

42:02.041 --> 42:04.541
evaporation, precipitation,
and collection.

42:04.625 --> 42:06.125
All of them are equally boring...

42:08.000 --> 42:08.833
One second, Sunny.

42:08.916 --> 42:10.666
...but so much less upsetting...

42:11.208 --> 42:14.500
than the natural phenomena
the Baudelaires were about to behold.

42:17.791 --> 42:18.750
Oh, no.

42:21.375 --> 42:22.791
No! No, no, no!

42:22.875 --> 42:24.041
No, no, no!

42:24.125 --> 42:26.125
[Violet gasps] It'll be okay.

42:26.208 --> 42:27.416
It'll be okay, Sunny.

42:27.750 --> 42:28.583
Don't worry.

42:28.666 --> 42:32.791
Hee-hee-ho-ho.

42:37.625 --> 42:40.000
[theme music playing]
