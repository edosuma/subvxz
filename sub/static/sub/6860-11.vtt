The Jedi Council deploys
a squad of droids

00:20.818 --> 00:23.887
on a desperate mission
aboard a Separatist cruiser.

00:23.921 --> 00:26.189
Under the guidance
of Colonel Meebur Gascon,

00:26.223 --> 00:30.326
the droids succeed in stealing
a crucial encryption module.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.595
Now the colonel and his droid squad

00:32.630 --> 00:35.298
must return the module
to the Jedi Temple

00:35.332 --> 00:37.033
to crack a Separatist code

00:37.068 --> 00:41.004
detailing an impending terror
plot against the Republic.

00:43.941 --> 00:47.309
How long until my command
center is operational again?

00:47.344 --> 00:49.711
[R2-D2 whistles and beeps]

00:49.746 --> 00:52.214
Okay, fine.

00:52.249 --> 00:56.852
I meant how long until Beezee
is operational again?

00:56.886 --> 00:58.387
[R2-D2 beeps]

00:58.421 --> 00:59.989
Well, make it fast.

01:00.023 --> 01:03.025
We must get this encryption
module back to the Republic

01:03.060 --> 01:04.860
as soon as possible.

Oh, Beezee, you are all better.

[Beezee beeps]

01:30.687 --> 01:32.888
WAC, what are you doing back here?

01:32.923 --> 01:35.524
Who is flying this shuttle?

01:35.558 --> 01:37.893
I have good news and bad news, Colonel.

01:37.928 --> 01:40.963
The bad news is, scans are
picking up giant ice formations,

01:40.997 --> 01:43.865
commonly called comets,
heading straight for us.

01:43.899 --> 01:44.966
What? Wha--

01:45.001 --> 01:46.134
[R2-D2 beeps]

01:46.169 --> 01:48.436
What in the world is the good news?

01:48.471 --> 01:50.038
At least you have a good excuse

01:50.072 --> 01:52.174
if your mission is a failure.

01:52.208 --> 01:55.044

The shuttle's power system
has been knocked out.

02:37.687 --> 02:39.588
I can see that.

02:39.622 --> 02:41.623

03:24.500 --> 03:27.401
We need the primary motivators
reestablished now.

03:27.436 --> 03:28.436
Forget that.

03:28.470 --> 03:29.904
We need the engines to come on.

to put her down on that planet.

05:19.113 --> 05:20.581
Is it Separatist-controlled?

05:20.615 --> 05:21.581
Who cares?

05:21.616 --> 05:22.683
I care.

05:22.717 --> 05:24.785
We can't jeopardize the mission.

05:24.819 --> 05:27.255

[droid beeping]

Don't be absurd.

07:08.343 --> 07:10.577
We can't just go rushing off like fools

07:10.611 --> 07:12.279
into this--this void.

07:12.313 --> 07:14.782
We need to stay put,
consider all the facts,

07:14.816 --> 07:17.718
and then I'll, uh--I'll draw up
a reconnaissance plan,

07:17.752 --> 07:19.687
and we can--
hey, hey!

07:19.721 --> 07:21.655
Where are you going, soldier?

07:21.689 --> 07:23.491
[R2-D2 beeps]

07:23.525 --> 07:27.127

07:30.198 --> 07:31.965

07:35.270 --> 07:37.204
[R2-D2 beeps]

07:37.239 --> 07:40.341
I will not stand for insubordination.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.642
Do not worry, Colonel.

07:41.676 --> 07:43.410
I can lead the mission from here

07:43.444 --> 07:45.012
and return the module.

07:45.046 --> 07:48.248
Maybe they'll give me a promotion.

07:48.283 --> 07:50.684
Over my dead body.

07:50.718 --> 07:52.719
Beezee, pop your top.

07:52.754 --> 07:57.291
I will not let you droids
commandeer my mission.

08:31.958 --> 08:34.626
Ugh, I can't believe I came this close

08:34.660 --> 08:36.796
to completing my first mission

08:36.863 --> 08:40.700
only to get lost
in this detestable desert.

08:40.734 --> 08:42.467
Look on the bright side, Colonel.

08:42.501 --> 08:44.637
At least it is a sunny day.

08:44.671 --> 08:47.640
What sun?
I don't see any sun.

08:47.674 --> 08:51.044
It's just hot and oppressive.

08:51.078 --> 08:53.212
Wait a minute.

08:53.247 --> 08:54.847
There's no sun.

08:54.882 --> 08:57.150
How do we know
which direction we're going?

08:57.184 --> 08:58.852
[R2-D2 beeps]

08:58.886 --> 09:02.589
You set your directional
guidance to "straight"?

09:02.623 --> 09:04.224
That's all we're going on,

09:04.258 --> 09:07.060
some rudimentary programming directive

09:07.094 --> 09:09.396
in a lousy astromech?

09:09.430 --> 09:11.799
[R2-D2 warbles]

09:13.635 --> 09:16.637
Yes, I know you're designed
for navigation,

09:16.671 --> 09:18.672
but that requires map coordinates

09:18.707 --> 09:20.474
and environmental input--

09:20.508 --> 09:23.543
something we are sorely lacking here.

09:23.578 --> 09:26.747
All right, we can't rely on technology.

09:26.814 --> 09:29.115
We have to rely on my training,

09:29.150 --> 09:32.485
something you droids don't have.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.522
How do you know, Colonel?

09:35.556 --> 09:37.924
Because droids don't get training.

09:37.959 --> 09:39.125
You get programmed.

09:39.159 --> 09:40.860
clang!
[droid beeps]

09:40.894 --> 09:43.262
That's your weakness.

09:43.297 --> 09:47.667
So how is your training going
to lead us out of this void?

09:47.702 --> 09:52.072
Well, uh, my, uh, training
as an officer tells me

09:52.106 --> 09:55.208
to use all available resources
to, uh--

09:55.243 --> 09:58.145
to stay alive until help comes.

09:58.179 --> 10:00.280
So your officer training--

10:00.314 --> 10:02.082
how exactly did you learn that?

10:02.116 --> 10:05.685
It was drilled into me by my superiors.

10:05.719 --> 10:07.053
Then you were programmed.

10:07.087 --> 10:08.754
Just like us.

10:08.789 --> 10:09.889
What?

10:09.923 --> 10:12.725
No, I am not like you droids in any way.

10:12.759 --> 10:15.795
I can think outside
my program--

10:15.829 --> 10:17.363
I mean, my training.

10:17.397 --> 10:20.699
And I can make decisions based
on a complex analysis

10:20.734 --> 10:22.167
of a situation,

10:22.202 --> 10:25.937
which is why I insist we return
to the ship.

10:25.972 --> 10:27.105
Wait a minute.

10:27.139 --> 10:29.140
Why can't I find our tracks?

10:29.208 --> 10:30.842
There are not any.

10:30.876 --> 10:32.243
What?

10:32.277 --> 10:33.511
I noticed it earlier.

10:33.545 --> 10:36.079
This surface leaves no trace of us.

10:36.114 --> 10:37.881
You noticed it earlier?

10:37.915 --> 10:41.284
Why in the world
didn't you say anything?

10:41.319 --> 10:43.553
I did not think we would want
to go backwards

10:43.587 --> 10:46.856
when forwards seems to be
the only way out of this void.

10:46.891 --> 10:48.091
[groans]

10:48.125 --> 10:50.126
Why are you thinking?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.694
I don't want you to think.

10:51.729 --> 10:53.396
Thinking is my job.

10:53.430 --> 10:55.398
I am the commanding officer.

10:55.432 --> 10:57.700
You are just a pilot.

10:57.768 --> 11:00.303
Oh, that hurt.

11:00.338 --> 11:02.706
Ugh.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.574
I have been thinking, Colonel.

11:04.608 --> 11:07.910
I told you not to do that.

11:07.945 --> 11:10.813
My programming keeps me
focused on the task at hand,

11:10.848 --> 11:13.550
which means I do not have
to worry about my health.

11:13.584 --> 11:15.285
I just have to worry about the mission.

11:15.319 --> 11:17.387
Don't even go there.

11:17.421 --> 11:18.755
So I think--

11:18.789 --> 11:20.490
- Don't do that!

11:20.524 --> 11:23.827
When you die,
I should lead D-Squad.

11:23.861 --> 11:25.729
Stop!

11:25.763 --> 11:27.030
[droids clanking]

11:27.065 --> 11:28.666
[R2-D2 beeps]

11:28.700 --> 11:30.434
You are what's killing me!

11:30.468 --> 11:33.904
I can't believe I am forced
to justify my existence

11:33.938 --> 11:35.472
with a droid!

11:35.507 --> 11:37.407
Ugh! I'm at the end!

11:37.442 --> 11:38.742
I can feel it!

11:38.776 --> 11:43.547
All I ask is that you
just let me die with dignity!

11:43.581 --> 11:46.116
Is that possible?

11:46.150 --> 11:49.153
[R2-D2 beeps]

11:49.187 --> 11:50.187
What?

11:50.221 --> 11:52.156
Our ship?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.994
[laughs]

11:57.028 --> 11:59.296
You--you stupid lucky droids.

11:59.331 --> 12:03.334
You have just taken us in a circle.

12:13.346 --> 12:14.380
Wait a minute.

12:14.414 --> 12:16.715
Is this really our ship?

12:18.118 --> 12:20.186
How long have we been gone?

12:26.927 --> 12:29.895
Ugh.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.930
No, it is not our ship.

12:31.965 --> 12:33.966
No, no, no!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.469
No, no, no!

12:37.838 --> 12:39.472
[R2-D2 beeps]

12:39.506 --> 12:42.275
[R2-D2 whimpers]

12:42.309 --> 12:43.509
Artoo is right.

12:43.543 --> 12:47.013
This is what happens
when you stay at the ship.

12:47.047 --> 12:50.382
Why is this happening to me?

13:06.001 --> 13:07.035
[grunting]

13:08.871 --> 13:10.772
[whimpering]

13:23.284 --> 13:25.285
[droid beeping]

13:25.319 --> 13:26.586
Maybe he is going to jump

13:26.620 --> 13:29.022
and put himself out of his misery.

13:29.056 --> 13:30.537
[droid chirping]

13:30.657 --> 13:34.026
Well, I vote for myself as
the new leader of this mission.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.594
[droids beeping]

13:37.796 --> 13:39.497
You cannot vote for Artoo.

13:39.531 --> 13:41.232
He is just a mech.

13:41.266 --> 13:42.833
He cannot lead a squadron.

13:42.867 --> 13:45.169
[R2-D2 beeps]

13:45.203 --> 13:48.506
Help!

13:48.540 --> 13:52.377
There has to be something out there!

13:52.411 --> 13:55.013
Show me a sign.

13:55.047 --> 13:57.816
A glimmer of hope!

13:57.850 --> 13:59.551
[sobbing]

13:59.585 --> 14:01.453
[Beezee warbling]

14:04.290 --> 14:06.725
I do not know who he is talking to.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.727
Maybe whoever programmed him.

14:10.630 --> 14:12.631
[groaning]

14:19.506 --> 14:20.506
[gasping]

14:20.540 --> 14:21.474
There!

14:21.541 --> 14:22.675
I see something.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.210
Ooh, a village!

14:24.244 --> 14:25.878
[laughs]

14:28.749 --> 14:31.117
[laughing maniacally]

14:31.152 --> 14:33.587
[R2-D2 beeps]

14:33.621 --> 14:35.188
What are you waiting for?

14:35.222 --> 14:36.656
We're saved!

14:36.690 --> 14:39.091
[laughs maniacally]

14:49.270 --> 14:52.372
[giggling]

14:55.711 --> 14:58.046
What exactly do you see, Colonel?

14:58.080 --> 14:59.581
[panting] I don't know.

14:59.615 --> 15:01.116
Hard to say.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.451
An outpost.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.787
Maybe a cantina.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.590
Whatever it is, they can help us.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.396
[R2-D2 beeps]

15:13.430 --> 15:16.165
I do not see anything either, Artoo.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.767
He should have jumped.

15:45.929 --> 15:47.229
No.

15:47.264 --> 15:50.766
We're going in circles again.

15:52.169 --> 15:54.303
[giggling maniacally]

16:02.979 --> 16:04.980
[R2-D2 beeps]

16:06.817 --> 16:07.950
I agree.

16:07.984 --> 16:10.453
We cannot trust his training anymore.

16:10.487 --> 16:13.089
But I cannot trust your
programming either,

16:13.123 --> 16:16.460
especially if you will not vote
for me to be the new leader.

16:16.494 --> 16:18.362
[R2-D2 beeps]

16:18.430 --> 16:19.864
Where are you going now?

16:19.898 --> 16:21.899
[droids beeping]

16:21.934 --> 16:23.601
[laughing]

16:23.636 --> 16:25.269
Hey, that is not true.

16:25.304 --> 16:28.239
I am more than just a pilot!

16:32.776 --> 16:35.044
We need a new plan, Colonel.

16:35.079 --> 16:36.613
I just realized:

16:36.647 --> 16:38.647
what if I'm dead?

16:38.682 --> 16:41.516
Ooh, what if I died
in that shuttle crash

16:41.551 --> 16:45.554
and now--now I'm stuck here
in limbo?

16:45.588 --> 16:47.055
Yes.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.090
I should have gone with the mechs.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.027
Think about it.

16:52.061 --> 16:54.529
Life.
Life is a void.

16:54.564 --> 16:56.998
We search and search for answers,

16:57.033 --> 16:58.533
but there are none.

16:58.567 --> 17:01.002
Hope is just an illusion, WAC.

17:01.037 --> 17:04.371
Death is the only certainty.

17:05.473 --> 17:08.542
Giving up is not in my programming.

17:08.577 --> 17:11.880
I am surprised that it
is in yours, Colonel.

17:19.656 --> 17:21.891
Maybe--

17:21.925 --> 17:23.059
maybe you're right.

17:23.093 --> 17:26.061
I was taught to find a rational solution

17:26.096 --> 17:27.763
to every problem.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.699
But this void--

17:29.734 --> 17:33.871
this proves that that's not
always possible.

17:33.906 --> 17:36.641
Maybe I need to change how I see things,

17:36.675 --> 17:38.576
and that will change my programming,

17:38.610 --> 17:41.513
my training.

17:41.547 --> 17:42.614
You know what?

17:42.648 --> 17:45.684
You are more than just a pilot, WAC.

17:45.718 --> 17:47.018
[laughs]

17:47.053 --> 17:48.687
I knew it!
I knew it!

17:48.721 --> 17:50.322
[laughing]

17:50.356 --> 17:53.926
All right, all right,
calm down, soldier.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.495
[water bottle clanking]

18:02.702 --> 18:05.872
[rumbling]

18:05.906 --> 18:07.707
[footfalls thundering]

18:07.741 --> 18:09.876
[creatures squawking]

18:14.348 --> 18:16.583
Whoa! Whoa!

18:20.655 --> 18:21.889
[laughs]

18:21.957 --> 18:24.292
This is our way out of the void!

18:24.326 --> 18:26.460
You have lost your mind, Colonel!

18:26.495 --> 18:27.761
No!

18:27.796 --> 18:29.696
This is our only hope!

18:29.731 --> 18:32.399
We've got to stop following my training

18:32.434 --> 18:34.168
or your programming

18:34.236 --> 18:36.804
and follow the birds' instincts!

18:36.838 --> 18:39.240
Grab hold!

18:39.275 --> 18:40.375
Like this?

18:40.409 --> 18:42.076
Whoa!

18:58.158 --> 18:59.892
[creatures squawking]

19:07.667 --> 19:09.434
Look.

19:10.603 --> 19:12.704
I can see a town from here.

19:16.743 --> 19:19.078
You can see that, right?

19:21.548 --> 19:22.915
I sure can.

19:22.950 --> 19:24.450
How did you know, Colonel,

19:24.485 --> 19:26.452
that these creatures would
get us out of the void?

19:26.487 --> 19:27.653
[laughs]

19:27.688 --> 19:29.355
You've got your programming.

19:29.389 --> 19:31.324
I've got my training.

19:31.358 --> 19:34.326
But these creatures,
they have their instinct.

19:34.361 --> 19:37.062
They know how to survive out here.

19:37.097 --> 19:39.098
If you say so.

19:51.412 --> 19:52.745
[creatures squawking]

20:15.870 --> 20:17.403
[R2-D2 whistles]

20:19.740 --> 20:21.775
I don't believe it.

20:21.809 --> 20:24.711
Those mechs beat us here.

20:24.746 --> 20:27.481
Stupid lucky droids.

20:27.516 --> 20:30.351
Just like you said, Colonel.

20:30.385 --> 20:31.686
Tell you what, WAC.

20:31.754 --> 20:34.555
Why don't you get the squad
ready to roll?

20:34.590 --> 20:37.525
I've got a second chance
to complete this mission,

20:37.560 --> 20:40.229
and I intend to take advantage of it.

20:40.263 --> 20:44.166
After I rehydrate myself.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.670
That'll be all, Corporal.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.239
Corporal?

20:50.274 --> 20:51.541
Yes, sir.

20:51.575 --> 20:54.210
The squad will be ready to roll.

20:55.445 --> 20:57.747
Attention!

20:57.781 --> 21:00.249
Front and center, soldiers!

21:00.283 --> 21:04.220
I want us ready to roll pronto, pronto!

21:04.255 --> 21:07.223
[R2-D2 beeps]

21:07.257 --> 21:10.459
That is Corporal WAC to you, soldier.

21:10.494 --> 21:14.263
And I will not tolerate insubordination!

21:14.297 --> 21:16.698
[R2-D2 beeps]

21:19.269 --> 21:21.136
[R2-D2 chuckles]
