let those guys go. Right, P?

20:18.175 --> 20:20.845
But how was he supposed to know
you had a tracker on their truck?

20:20.845 --> 20:22.722
He understands how
these things are.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.807
One minute
you're catching a thief,

20:24.807 --> 20:27.727
the next you get Intel they might be
leading you somewhere bigger and better.

20:27.727 --> 20:32.231
Oh, and by bigger and better you
obviously mean me. Right? Right?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.942
Yeah, right.
Ah, anyway.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.236
You got some serious
skills there, P.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.821
(CHATTERING)

20:38.821 --> 20:41.198
Oh, stop.
You're making me blush.

20:41.198 --> 20:45.745
I can see that things went well
with our neighbors to the North.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.246
Well, now that our
mission is done...

20:47.246 --> 20:48.372
Our mission?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.458
Maybe we could
drop by Niagara Falls.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.127
It's so close by and I've
always wanted to see it.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.755
Well, I suppose we could
swing by on our way back.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.965
(VIOLINS PLAYING)

21:05.014 --> 21:06.390
(SUCKING NOISILY)

21:34.877 --> 21:35.920
(SIGHS)

21:39.924 --> 21:43.177
I wonder how my scheme worked
out for Professor Bannister.

21:43.177 --> 21:46.931
I'm sure that Cloud-Magnetize-inator
was a winner.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.935
CANDACE: Mom! Mom! Morn!
Hey, Perry. Mom! Mom! Mom!

21:50.935 --> 21:52.937
PHINEAS: How was it that a
cloud was able to carry off

21:52.937 --> 21:54.939
our metal super structure?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.273
But, but, but...

21:56.273 --> 21:58.400
Someone's got
a bathroom to clean.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.569
Everyone else,
there's pie.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.071
Oh, there you are, Perry.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.949
Ah, a platypus' life
is a life of leisure.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.575
Yes. Yes, it is.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.960
We'd like to apologize on behalf of the
show for poking a little fun at Greenland.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.212
The Greenland flag
is actually verifiably cool.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.839
It was designed by
Thue Christiansen

22:19.839 --> 22:23.050
as part of a flag designing
contest in the '80s?

22:23.050 --> 22:24.552
Is this actually
true, Carl?

22:24.552 --> 22:26.428
CARL: According
to the Internet, sir.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.473
Also, we understand that
the people of Greenland

22:29.473 --> 22:31.308
do have enormous
national pride

22:31.308 --> 22:33.227
and are not
necessarily short.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.854
This was all purely
in the interest of comedy

22:34.854 --> 22:37.064
and not meant
to be taken seriously.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.190
Go, Greenland!
