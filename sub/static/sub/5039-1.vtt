00:20.033 --> 00:22.831
Tada! And here we are,
the stars of the hour

00:22.869 --> 00:24.530
on Amy's new video camera.

00:24.571 --> 00:27.131
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.

00:27.174 --> 00:28.835
Yeah, well,
mine love me too, slut.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.809
Bitch.

00:58.705 --> 01:01.833
l'd like to know who came up
with the stupid rule

01:01.875 --> 01:04.742
that you have to go back to school
the very next day after New Year's.

01:04.778 --> 01:06.268
lt's so fucking stupid.

01:06.313 --> 01:08.941
- When would you want to go back?
- Like Easter.

01:08.982 --> 01:10.813
At least then l wouldn't
feel so wasted.

01:10.851 --> 01:12.341
Let me use it too.

01:12.386 --> 01:14.877
- You don't even use makeup.
- l do too.

01:14.921 --> 01:16.445
Like what?
Like some baby powder?

01:16.490 --> 01:18.481
Shut up.

01:18.525 --> 01:20.925
Virgins don't know
how to wear makeup.

01:25.665 --> 01:28.429
Oh, come on.
l didn't mean anything by it.

01:28.468 --> 01:31.335
- You're so fucking sensitive.
- Whatever.

01:31.371 --> 01:33.236
l don't see what
the big deal is anyway.

01:33.273 --> 01:35.366
Just fuck some guy
and get it over with.

01:35.409 --> 01:37.775
Good advice. Thanks.

01:39.413 --> 01:41.711
You're a ho-- H-O, ho.

01:41.748 --> 01:44.649
Jealousy talking.
Blah blah blah.

01:44.684 --> 01:47.118
That guy over there would do you.

01:56.229 --> 01:57.218
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey.

01:57.264 --> 01:58.629
Hey, Meg.

01:58.665 --> 02:00.724
Did you get some of that shit
Tercel had today?

02:00.767 --> 02:03.497
- No. Was it good?
- Fuckin' awesome, girl.

02:03.537 --> 02:05.528
Fuck! He didn't even tell me
he had some.

02:05.572 --> 02:08.439
- Last time l blow him.
- You blew Tercel?

02:08.475 --> 02:10.739
Like you haven't.
l've seen the stash you carry.

02:10.776 --> 02:12.404
l didn't have to blow him
for anything.

02:12.446 --> 02:13.913
Yeah yeah, l'm sure.

02:13.947 --> 02:16.541
- Can you save me some?
- Um, no.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.347
- Me and Gideon are partying tonight.
- You party every night.

02:19.386 --> 02:21.684
What's so special about one night?
Come on, save me some.

02:21.721 --> 02:23.712
( boy laughs )
Ask her what she'll do for it.

02:23.757 --> 02:26.157
Gideon wants to know
what you're willing to do for it.

02:26.193 --> 02:27.785
- ls he there?
- ( Gideon laughing )

02:27.828 --> 02:29.659
- Yeah.
- Fuck, Angie!

02:29.696 --> 02:31.926
Can't a person have
a private conversation?

02:31.965 --> 02:34.934
Come on, Meggie, there's no secrets
between me and you.

02:34.968 --> 02:38.529
- l know you inside and out.
- Go fuck yourself.

02:38.572 --> 02:40.472
Why don't you come on over here
and play with me and Angie?

02:40.507 --> 02:42.031
Yeah, in your dreams, you dork.

02:42.075 --> 02:43.906
Aw, come on.
You know you want to.

02:43.944 --> 02:46.469
Woman: God damn it, Megan!
Why didn't my program record?

02:46.513 --> 02:49.744
l unplugged the VCR to use the game box
and l forgot to plug it back in.

02:49.783 --> 02:51.512
You forgot?!
You forgot?!

02:51.551 --> 02:54.213
l worked 1 2 hours a fucking day
to buy you that box

02:54.254 --> 02:56.848
and all l ask is that you let me watch
my fucking program!

02:56.890 --> 02:59.757
( both shouting )

02:59.793 --> 03:01.317
- Lay off me.
- You selfish bitch.

03:01.361 --> 03:03.488
Why don't you go live with your father
and get the fuck out of my life?

03:03.530 --> 03:06.226
l bought this game box.
lt's out of here!

03:07.334 --> 03:12.135
Wow, your mom is crazy.
What a twisted bitch.

03:12.172 --> 03:16.404
- She's crazier than my mom.
- ( object clatters, breaks )

03:16.443 --> 03:17.535
What are you doing?

03:17.577 --> 03:19.135
Miss Stewart:
You're going to learn to respect me!

03:19.179 --> 03:21.170
- Megan: That's mine!
- No. l paid for it

03:21.214 --> 03:23.205
- and l get to smash it!
- Oh no.

03:24.518 --> 03:26.509
Oh no.

03:29.623 --> 03:30.954
- ( clears throat )
- ( computer chimes )

03:30.991 --> 03:32.424
- Oh, hold on.
- Mm-hmm.

03:32.459 --> 03:34.984
Hey, Meg.
What's happening?

03:35.028 --> 03:37.792
Hey, Amy. Nothing.
Just hanging.

03:37.831 --> 03:39.822
l know it's a little late,
but l was wondering if you want

03:39.866 --> 03:42.494
to hit the mall before they close
and see the new Choo shoes.

03:42.536 --> 03:44.094
You want to go to the mall?

03:44.137 --> 03:47.402
Yeah, or we can just hang out.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.432
l can't. l have to do stuff
with my mom.

03:50.477 --> 03:51.910
Are you all right?

03:51.945 --> 03:54.436
Yeah. Fuckin' cat fur
makes me vomit.

03:54.481 --> 03:57.746
l told you, you have to keep him
out of your bedroom at night.

03:57.784 --> 03:59.479
Yeah, you told me.

03:59.519 --> 04:02.215
Okay well, if you need anything
call me, okay?

04:02.255 --> 04:05.190
- l'll see you in school tomorrow.
- Yeah. Thanks, Amy.

04:05.225 --> 04:06.715
- Ciao.
- Bye.

04:10.363 --> 04:12.695
So what's it going to be, Meggie?

04:12.732 --> 04:16.565
You know only Gideon's slaves
get the fairy dust.

04:19.773 --> 04:21.942
- l'll be right over.
- ( Gideon laughs )

04:41.928 --> 04:45.159
- ( knocking at door )
- Come in.

04:46.466 --> 04:49.230
- Morning, princess.
- Morning, Daddy.

04:49.269 --> 04:52.534
You know, Party Restaurant's
getting all booked up.

04:52.572 --> 04:54.563
Are you sure you don't want to have
your birthday party there?

04:54.608 --> 04:55.802
Daddy, it's for kids.

04:55.842 --> 04:57.742
l don't want people
who dress up like bears

04:57.777 --> 04:59.108
singing ''Happy Birthday'' to me.

04:59.145 --> 05:02.842
- Well, you used to like that.
- Yeah, when l was like 10.

05:02.882 --> 05:05.817
Well, try not to grow up
so fast, okay?

05:05.852 --> 05:08.787
lt makes your dad
feel really really old.

05:09.889 --> 05:12.858
( kisses )
You'll never be old, Daddy.

05:12.892 --> 05:16.658
Well, l'll figure something special
to get you for your birthday.

05:16.696 --> 05:18.926
Like maybe a video camera?

05:18.965 --> 05:21.365
Hmm, mortgage payment,
video camera.

05:21.401 --> 05:24.802
- What should l do?
- lt doesn't cost that much, jerk.

05:24.838 --> 05:27.033
Louise, your daughter
just called me a jerk.

05:27.073 --> 05:29.132
She's right, you know?

05:29.175 --> 05:32.667
Women, always ganging up
on defenseless men.

05:32.712 --> 05:35.772
( chuckles )
All right, get ready for school.

05:35.815 --> 05:37.373
We'll talk about
your present later, princess.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.146
Okay.

05:39.185 --> 05:40.618
Hurry up, Amy.
You're going to be late.

05:40.654 --> 05:42.645
Okay.

05:52.432 --> 05:54.423
( sighs )

05:56.870 --> 06:00.169
Princess.
Princess Pudgy.

06:03.576 --> 06:05.066
- ( beeps )
- Ben?

06:05.111 --> 06:07.079
- What's up, ma?
- Oh hey, Ben.

06:07.113 --> 06:09.604
- Hey, Ben.
- Damn, all the hot girls in one place?

06:09.649 --> 06:12.117
- Yeah, where you're not.
- Bogus ass.

06:12.152 --> 06:13.619
Why you gotta do me like that?

06:13.653 --> 06:15.951
Because she doesn't
do losers, duh.

06:15.989 --> 06:17.547
- Ah, l see.
- Yeah, she's not Kathy.

06:17.590 --> 06:20.024
- Oh, shut up.
- All you girls are crazy as hell.

06:20.060 --> 06:21.687
So what's going on
with this weekend?

06:21.728 --> 06:23.286
Party's on this weekend.

06:23.329 --> 06:24.853
You can come by the crib
around midnight.

06:24.898 --> 06:27.890
- Shit'll be off the hook.
- Cool. Can l bring Aaron?

06:27.934 --> 06:30.129
- Nope. No dudes.
- Why not?

06:30.170 --> 06:32.434
Because it's my party
and it's my rules, that's why.

06:32.472 --> 06:33.530
Yeah, whatever.

06:33.573 --> 06:35.234
Yeah, Kathy, you'd better
obey the rules.

06:35.275 --> 06:36.264
Oh, shut up.

06:36.309 --> 06:38.607
l have footage of you
''obeying the rules''

06:38.645 --> 06:40.545
on your hands and knees
at the last party.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.639
Hey, Ben, can l bring Amy?

06:42.682 --> 06:46.413
Man, this is a party, not church.

06:46.453 --> 06:49.354
You're not really going
to drag her along, are you?

06:49.389 --> 06:52.119
Whoa, y'all need to chill.
What's wrong with Amy?

06:52.158 --> 06:54.592
Oh well, let's think.
She's a drag.

06:54.627 --> 06:56.754
She ain't fun for shit.
She don't know how to dress.

06:56.796 --> 06:58.093
Amy is hot.

06:58.131 --> 07:00.656
Man, if Amy was hot,

07:00.700 --> 07:02.361
Lexie would have
fucked her by now.

07:02.402 --> 07:03.426
Shut up!

07:03.470 --> 07:05.131
No, we all know
you go with the flow.

07:05.171 --> 07:07.935
Look, Ben, l'm serious.
Her birthday's coming up.

07:07.974 --> 07:10.534
Oh. Well, she's going
to get an ass-whupping

07:10.577 --> 07:12.477
if she comes to my party.

07:12.512 --> 07:15.208
Well, either Amy comes or l don't.

07:15.248 --> 07:16.977
( mutters )

07:17.016 --> 07:19.007
- We gotta go, Meg.
- Okay, bye.

07:19.052 --> 07:21.282
See you later.

07:21.321 --> 07:23.551
What is it with you and this girl?

07:23.590 --> 07:25.683
You fuckin' her?
She got blackmail on you? What?

07:25.725 --> 07:26.919
She's my friend.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.621
She's not a fucking loser
like the rest of you.

07:28.661 --> 07:30.856
Yeah well, l got a reputation
to think about.

07:30.897 --> 07:33.695
l run the best parties
and you are my premier party girl.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.964
You bringing Amy along
could take away that crown.

07:37.003 --> 07:39.062
Well, maybe l don't need to have it.

07:39.105 --> 07:40.697
Yeah, you do.

07:40.740 --> 07:43.072
What the fuck else do you got?

07:44.778 --> 07:46.837
Does Amy come
or do l spend quality time

07:46.880 --> 07:49.747
with my mom Saturday night?

07:49.783 --> 07:51.944
- You owe me for this.
- Yeah, take a number.

07:51.985 --> 07:52.974
l'm not kidding.

07:53.019 --> 07:56.216
You're going to be jumping hoops
if you want to bring Miss Party Killer.

07:59.359 --> 08:02.328
You just make sure
you take a fucking bath.

08:06.466 --> 08:09.458
( rock music playing, chatter )

08:12.839 --> 08:14.830
Oh, here they are.

08:32.892 --> 08:34.826
Get in there.
You're sucking my dick.

08:34.861 --> 08:38.490
Oh shit, the hot squad

08:38.530 --> 08:39.691

08:47.207 --> 08:49.198
Oh, you sure you want
to enter the harem?

08:49.242 --> 08:50.732
lt ain't for lightweights,
sweetheart.

08:50.777 --> 08:52.540
- Yes.
- Ben: l don't know.

08:52.579 --> 08:54.069
Jesus Christ!

Eh, remember, Meg,

08:59.719 --> 09:01.584
Come on in.
Let's go, let's go.

Mm mm! Go on in.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.952
( loud rock music playing )

09:46.332 --> 09:49.324
( people cheering )

09:57.310 --> 10:00.302
( no audible dialogue )

10:16.462 --> 10:19.431
Boy: Hey, Lexie, can l see

11:02.675 --> 11:05.109
Okay okay, Kathy, tell me,

11:05.144 --> 11:07.044

11:07.080 --> 11:10.846
- To get fucked up.
- Okay.

So, uh, what are you right now?

Come here.
What's up, baby girl?

11:39.979 --> 11:42.243

- Boy: Oh, where are you going?

13:25.218 --> 13:26.480

13:26.519 --> 13:29.420
Aren't you going to be late

13:29.455 --> 13:32.447
( chatter )

13:34.727 --> 13:36.718
Boy:

13:36.762 --> 13:38.889
Maybe l can help you, baby.

13:42.401 --> 13:44.392
Ben:

13:44.437 --> 13:46.428

13:49.208 --> 13:52.234

14:14.600 --> 14:16.591
( loud music continues )

14:34.654 --> 14:36.178
Ahh!

14:36.222 --> 14:39.214
( no audible dialogue )

15:06.085 --> 15:09.919
Boy: Hey, Lexie, why don't you do

15:09.956 --> 15:12.151

15:12.191 --> 15:14.022
Boy:
Make out or something.

15:14.060 --> 15:16.255
Oh yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

15:16.295 --> 15:18.229
We don't make out for hired help.

15:18.264 --> 15:20.994
Well, fuckin' do something.
Jesus.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.365
All right, watch this.

15:37.683 --> 15:41.710
Boy:
Oh, man. Aw shit.

15:45.124 --> 15:46.955
( gasps )

15:46.993 --> 15:49.461
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

15:49.495 --> 15:50.826
- Lexie: Oh my God!
- ( laughter )

15:50.863 --> 15:53.024
- Boy: Oh God.
- Lexie: Fuck you!

15:53.065 --> 15:56.369
- Boy: She's wasted.
- Boy #2 : She is wasted.

16:00.473 --> 16:01.963
( beeps )

16:02.008 --> 16:06.138
- Hey, Meg.
- Hey. Are you okay?

16:06.178 --> 16:09.409
- l'm so stupid.
- No, you're not.

16:09.448 --> 16:12.144
lt was my fault.
l shouldn't have brought you there.

16:12.184 --> 16:15.585
- Now all your friends hate me.
- So what?

16:15.621 --> 16:18.249
Fuck them.
They're just shit.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.987
- l'm such a loser.
- No, you're not.

16:21.027 --> 16:22.995
l'm like nothing.

16:23.029 --> 16:25.429
No, l want you to shut up
about that.

16:28.234 --> 16:29.895
l don't know why
you're friends with me.

16:29.935 --> 16:33.302
Well, because l am, that's why.
Look, l'm the big fucking loser.

16:33.339 --> 16:36.137
l was the one blowing
some dickhead for a hit.

16:36.175 --> 16:37.506
That did look kind of gross.

16:37.543 --> 16:40.478
- Yeah, it tasted gross.
- Ew.

16:40.513 --> 16:42.811
l don't think l could ever do that.

16:42.848 --> 16:45.180
- l'd be way too embarrassed.
- Why?

16:45.217 --> 16:46.878
lt's like a power thing.
You're in charge.

16:46.919 --> 16:48.784
Oh, you really looked like
you were in charge.

16:48.821 --> 16:49.913
No, l'm serious.

16:49.955 --> 16:53.891
Like, the guy can't come
unless you let him.

16:53.926 --> 16:55.416
l don't know.

16:55.461 --> 16:57.691
Well, you know, someday
you're going to do it.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.698
l'll probably screw that up too.

16:59.732 --> 17:03.361
- Well, just practice before.
- Practice?

17:03.402 --> 17:04.835
- Yeah.
- Like how?

17:04.869 --> 17:06.770
Like on anything.
Like a banana.

17:06.806 --> 17:08.603
Try not to leave teeth marks.
( clicks tongue )

17:08.641 --> 17:10.438
Was that how you learned?

17:10.476 --> 17:12.467
- No.
- Tell me.

17:12.511 --> 17:14.502
l was at summer camp
when l was 10.

17:14.547 --> 17:16.276
You were 10 when you did it?

17:16.315 --> 17:19.375
Do you want to listen to this or not?

17:19.417 --> 17:22.114
So l was at summer camp
and there was this counselor.

17:22.154 --> 17:24.917
He was older, like 17.

17:24.957 --> 17:26.857
He was always telling me
that l was pretty and shit.

17:26.892 --> 17:28.723
So one day he tells me
to come to the pantry

17:28.761 --> 17:30.888
to like help him get paper plates.

17:30.930 --> 17:31.919
And it's really small in there,

17:31.964 --> 17:33.795
so we're like pressed up
against each other.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.358
- Was he really hot?
- He was okay.

17:36.402 --> 17:39.098
He looked kind of like that guy
in the movie ''Se7 en.''

17:39.138 --> 17:42.130
- Brad Pitt?
- No, the weird killer guy.

17:42.174 --> 17:44.005
Oh. Ew.

17:44.043 --> 17:46.671
Okay, anyways,
so he's pressed up against me

17:46.712 --> 17:50.170
and l can feel it
and it's like huge.

17:50.216 --> 17:52.116
And then he just looks at me
and pushes--

17:52.151 --> 17:54.381
he puts his hand on top of my head
and pushes me down to my knees

17:54.420 --> 17:56.445
- in front of him.
- Did you scream?

17:56.489 --> 17:58.116
No, he was really gentle.

17:58.157 --> 18:00.819
And then he unzips his jeans
and just takes it out.

18:00.860 --> 18:04.557
- And l was like, ''Whoa.''
- What was it like?

18:04.597 --> 18:08.966
lt was like this big fat snake
like staring me in the face.

18:09.001 --> 18:10.525
- Oh my God.
- And he's like waving it around

18:10.569 --> 18:12.696
and tapping it
on my nose and shit.

18:12.738 --> 18:14.205
And he puts it against my lips.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.105
l'm like, l don't know
what to do,

18:16.142 --> 18:18.838
but there's like
nowhere to go, you know?

18:18.878 --> 18:20.846
And he just keeps pushing,
and l think at some point

18:20.880 --> 18:22.609
l opened my mouth
to say something like,

18:22.648 --> 18:24.673
''Get that smelly thing
out of my face,''

18:24.717 --> 18:26.548
and he just shoved it in.

18:26.585 --> 18:29.713
- Did you choke?
- Yeah, because it was huge.

18:29.755 --> 18:32.223
My mouth was wide open
like this. Like--

18:32.258 --> 18:33.748
Oh wow.

18:33.793 --> 18:35.693
And l was starting to turn blue
because l couldn't breathe.

18:35.728 --> 18:37.787
And he tells me to breathe
through my nose and l do.

18:37.830 --> 18:40.390
And snot starts coming
out of my nose.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.697
- Oh my God.
- But it wasn't funny.

18:42.735 --> 18:44.828
l was like blowing my nose
all over his dick.

18:44.870 --> 18:46.269
And he's like pumping it
in and out,

18:46.305 --> 18:49.069
back and forth in my mouth
and grabbing my hair.

18:49.108 --> 18:51.269
Did you-- oh my God.

18:51.310 --> 18:55.508
- Did you scream?
- No.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.948
He told me a couple of times actually
to get my teeth out of the way,

18:57.983 --> 19:00.645
but like where the fuck
were they supposed to go?

19:00.686 --> 19:01.675
- You know?
- Yeah.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.018
l mean like there wasn't any room
in there for his dick and my teeth.

19:04.056 --> 19:06.251
( laughs )
Oh.

19:06.292 --> 19:08.817
So he just keeps pumping
and grabbing my hair.

19:08.861 --> 19:12.388
And at some point l look up
and l can see that he's going to come,

19:12.431 --> 19:14.524
because, you know, guys look
really stupid before they come.

19:14.567 --> 19:17.593
Mm-hmm.
Like how?

19:17.636 --> 19:20.366
Like, their faces get all scrunchy

19:20.406 --> 19:22.397
and they look like they're taking
a shit or something.

19:22.441 --> 19:24.705
Oh my God.

19:24.743 --> 19:26.643
So he's doing all this weird shit
with his face.

19:26.679 --> 19:27.771
Mm-hmm.

19:27.813 --> 19:30.941
And all of a sudden there's like
this explosion in my mouth

19:30.983 --> 19:33.679
and all this hot gooey stuff
starts coming out.

19:33.719 --> 19:35.880
- Did you swallow any of it?
- Yeah.

19:35.921 --> 19:37.855
l swallowed a lot of it
because l didn't have a choice.

19:37.890 --> 19:40.950
l mean there was like a gallon of it
and it just kept coming.

19:40.993 --> 19:43.655
And he's like grabbing my head
so l couldn't move or anything, right?

19:43.696 --> 19:46.597
And like l started coughing
and it just started coming

19:46.632 --> 19:48.725
out of my nose
and the sides of my mouth,

19:48.767 --> 19:49.961
like probably my ears.

19:50.002 --> 19:53.665
- Oh. Did it taste totally gross?
- lt was like--

19:53.706 --> 19:55.469
- Mom, what the fuck?
- Who are you talking to?

19:55.508 --> 19:58.944
lt's Amy. l was talking to Amy.
Jesus Christ.

19:58.978 --> 20:01.208
lt's me, Miss Stewart.
Sorry.

20:01.247 --> 20:04.683
lt's late.
Go to sleep, Megan.

20:04.717 --> 20:06.708
Sorry, Meg.

20:10.222 --> 20:12.213
Sorry.

20:15.394 --> 20:17.862
l-- l hate it here.

20:17.897 --> 20:20.365
l hate it so much.
l have to get out of here.

20:20.399 --> 20:22.924
Where would you go?

20:22.968 --> 20:24.629
l don't care.

20:24.670 --> 20:29.835
Well, if you go anywhere,
l'm going with you.

20:29.875 --> 20:33.811
- Really?
- Yeah. You're my best friend.

20:33.846 --> 20:35.837
Really?

20:35.881 --> 20:38.247
l don't know what l'd do
without you.

20:38.284 --> 20:40.548
Well, you're my best friend too, Amy.

20:40.586 --> 20:43.453
- Really?
- You're my only real friend.

20:43.489 --> 20:46.458
Miss Stewart:
Megan, go to sleep now!

20:48.327 --> 20:50.454
Maybe we'll run away together,

20:50.496 --> 20:53.021
go far away somewhere
like Texas or something.

20:53.065 --> 20:54.589
Why Texas?

20:54.633 --> 20:57.329
l don't know.
Sounds far away.

20:59.505 --> 21:02.167
Okay. Texas.

21:02.207 --> 21:03.799
Texas.

21:03.842 --> 21:06.709
- Good night, Amy.
- Good night, Meg.

21:10.883 --> 21:13.681
Tada! And here we are,
the stars of the hour

21:13.719 --> 21:15.380
on Amy's new video camera.

21:15.421 --> 21:17.981
My expensive new video camera.
Daddy loves me.

21:18.023 --> 21:19.957
Yeah, well, mine

Bitch.

21:21.827 --> 21:25.058

- l don't know.

21:25.097 --> 21:26.621
We can make a documentary
about my cat,

21:26.665 --> 21:28.633
like ''A Day in the Life of Charlie''
or something.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.793
- Are you for real?
- Mm-hmm.

21:29.835 --> 21:32.861
Okay, let's do something,

21:32.905 --> 21:34.873
Ooh, l know.
Why don't you strip?

l'm not doing that.

21:36.308 --> 21:38.173
Oh yeah, that's right.
We said not boring.

21:38.210 --> 21:39.837
Shut up.
You strip then.

21:39.878 --> 21:41.869
- Fine, l will.
- No no no no no.

21:41.914 --> 21:43.814
What if my parents

21:43.849 --> 21:46.181
Well, your dad's pretty hot.

21:46.218 --> 21:48.584
l so did not hear that.

21:48.621 --> 21:52.216
Okay, why don't we do an interview,

21:52.257 --> 21:53.747

22:54.687 --> 22:56.678
He's in prison.

23:00.426 --> 23:03.554
He fucked me for the first time
when l was nine.

23:05.764 --> 23:08.631
And he kept on fucking me
for two years.

23:12.738 --> 23:15.730
My mom was so afraid of losing him
that she wouldn't--

23:15.774 --> 23:18.265
she wouldn't even listen to me
when l told her about it.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.374
She even blamed me
when he got sent to prison.

23:30.889 --> 23:33.289
Guys like me.

23:33.325 --> 23:37.557
They've always liked me.
l'm... a likable girl, l guess.

23:39.231 --> 23:40.755
l'll pretty much do
what you want,

23:40.799 --> 23:44.360
but you have to tell me
that you love me.

23:49.441 --> 23:52.001
They're all so fucking pathetic.

24:17.536 --> 24:19.436
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey.

24:19.471 --> 24:22.372
- What the hell is that?
- lt's my stuffed animal.

24:22.407 --> 24:24.534
- lt's cute.
- Oh, it's adorable.

24:24.576 --> 24:26.134
Yeah, l know.

24:26.178 --> 24:28.806
- So are you going to go tonight?
- l don't know.

24:28.847 --> 24:30.576
There's never anything
but losers there.

24:30.616 --> 24:34.279
Yeah well, l've met some
pretty cool guys there like Jorge.

24:34.319 --> 24:37.447
Okay, l hate to break it to you,
but Jorge's not cool.

24:37.489 --> 24:40.390
Whatever.
He's fun to hang out with.

24:40.425 --> 24:43.588
- No.
- And so are you.

24:43.629 --> 24:46.928
l mean, maybe sometime
you want to hang out again?

24:46.965 --> 24:51.197
Um, Lex, l'm just not like comfortable
with what happened before.

24:51.236 --> 24:53.067
- Yeah, no. lt's okay.
- lt's just not me, you know?

24:53.105 --> 24:55.096
No, l understand.
That's fine.

24:55.140 --> 24:58.769
Um, actually l've been talking
to this new guy named Josh.

24:58.811 --> 25:01.245
- He's really cool.
- Oh yeah? What makes him cool?

25:01.280 --> 25:04.545
He skateboards
and he goes to Tolland

25:04.583 --> 25:07.381
- and he competes for real stuff.
- Oh really?

25:07.419 --> 25:09.944
And he saw that l like skateboarding
and so he added me.

25:09.988 --> 25:12.047
- You don't skateboard.
- Whatever.

25:12.090 --> 25:15.355
Guys dig it when chicks
are skateboarders.

25:15.394 --> 25:18.488
Lex! Oh my God.

25:18.530 --> 25:20.862
Oh, you should check it out.
lt's Skaterdude.

25:20.899 --> 25:22.890
- Okay.
- ( keyboard clicking )

25:26.939 --> 25:28.964
Doesn't he look like Brad Pitt?

25:29.007 --> 25:32.909
A little in the eyes, l guess.
Does Josh have a cam?

25:32.945 --> 25:36.244
He does, but his little brother
like busted it or something crazy, so...

25:36.281 --> 25:37.771
l don't know.
But--

25:37.816 --> 25:40.376
ooh, one time he met
George Clooney in person.

25:40.419 --> 25:41.977
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah.

25:42.020 --> 25:43.009
Oh my God.

25:43.055 --> 25:45.387
And he like talked to him
for like an hour at this mall and--

25:45.424 --> 25:47.119
- What mall?
- l don't know.

25:47.159 --> 25:49.127
We should like go
and stalk him or something.

25:49.161 --> 25:51.152
Yeah. That's funny.

25:51.196 --> 25:53.858
- But you should talk to him.
- Okay, maybe.

25:53.899 --> 25:55.389
Maybe if l'm bored l'll go.
l don't know.

25:55.434 --> 25:57.459
Okay. Well then,
l'll talk to you later.

25:57.502 --> 25:58.799
- Okay.
- Bye.

25:58.837 --> 26:00.828
Bye.

26:09.081 --> 26:12.881
Hello, my name's Amy Herman
and today's January 1 3th, 2007,

26:12.918 --> 26:15.386
and this is my video diary.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.684
This is my room.

26:17.723 --> 26:20.283
As you can see,
it's very neat and clean,

26:20.325 --> 26:23.624
because l believe cleanliness
is next to godliness.

26:25.230 --> 26:28.461
This is Mr. Rupert.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.593
He's in charge of all the rest
of the animals

26:30.636 --> 26:32.831
and he makes sure that
they all behave when l'm gone.

26:32.871 --> 26:35.396
l love him, but he's not
my favorite bear.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.876
My favorite bear is Billy Bear.
He's not here anymore.

26:43.615 --> 26:45.845
This is my best friend Megan.

26:45.884 --> 26:48.250
We go on all kinds
of crazy adventures.

26:48.287 --> 26:50.152
We're pretty wild together.

26:50.188 --> 26:52.782
We're like sisters.

26:52.824 --> 26:54.849
l just love her.

26:54.893 --> 26:58.420
As you can see,
l live in a pretty nice house.

26:58.463 --> 27:00.522
We live in an area
called Sherman Oaks.

27:00.565 --> 27:02.556
lf you're not from Los Angeles,

27:02.601 --> 27:04.432
you have no idea
what l'm talking about.

27:04.469 --> 27:07.836
But there it is.

27:07.873 --> 27:12.139
- This is my mom Louise.
- Amy, what are you doing?

27:12.177 --> 27:14.805
lt's my video diary.

27:14.846 --> 27:17.610
You want to tape me rushing around,
trying to get dinner ready?

27:17.649 --> 27:19.640
Sure. lt's real life.

27:19.685 --> 27:22.017
So is doing your homework
while l'm doing this.

27:22.054 --> 27:24.784
Mom's a real estate agent
as well as being a mom.

27:24.823 --> 27:27.189
She's probably crabby because
she didn't sell a house today.

27:27.225 --> 27:29.591
- Amy.
- ( laughs )

27:31.029 --> 27:34.988
This is my cat Charlie.
He's really old.

27:35.033 --> 27:39.470
He's actually older than me,
which makes him like 100 in cat years.

27:39.504 --> 27:41.495
That's really old.

27:41.540 --> 27:43.804
This is my backyard.

27:46.845 --> 27:48.335
This is our barbecue.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.007
When the weather's nice,
we'll barbecue

27:50.048 --> 27:53.745
and my parents will invite
some friends over for a party.

27:53.785 --> 27:55.377
My dad's not here.

27:55.420 --> 27:58.150
He works long hours,
but he always makes sure

27:58.190 --> 28:01.353
to be here on my birthday
and other important holidays.

28:01.393 --> 28:04.920
Well, that's my house.

28:04.963 --> 28:07.158
Thanks for joining me on the tour.

28:07.199 --> 28:09.997
Bye.
( laughs )

28:11.303 --> 28:13.134
( computer chimes )

28:13.171 --> 28:16.265
- Josh: Hello, hot chick.
- Hi, Skaterdude.

28:16.308 --> 28:19.471
- ( laughs ) My name's Josh.
- l know.

28:19.511 --> 28:21.103
How did you know that?

28:21.146 --> 28:23.512
My friend Lexie gave me
your address.

28:23.548 --> 28:25.743
Well, that was nice of her.

28:25.784 --> 28:28.480
- So what's your name?
- Megan.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.545
Nice name.

28:30.589 --> 28:33.888
l'm just checking your profile.

28:33.925 --> 28:36.018
So you go to Tolland?

28:36.061 --> 28:39.360
Yeah, when l go to school at all.
The teachers suck there.

28:39.398 --> 28:41.127
They do at Alton too.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.794
Oh, Alton.
So we live near each other.

28:43.835 --> 28:45.928
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

28:45.971 --> 28:47.962
You should come
skateboarding sometime.

28:48.006 --> 28:51.271
l don't board. l'll watch.
Where do you board?

28:51.309 --> 28:54.506
Usually down by the ravine
in the back of the diner.

28:54.546 --> 28:55.877
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.

28:55.914 --> 28:57.609
Yeah, l'm around there
all the time.

28:57.649 --> 28:59.116
Cool.

28:59.151 --> 29:01.984
Hey, can you tilt your webcam
down a little?

29:02.020 --> 29:03.544
Why?

29:03.588 --> 29:06.421
l don't know.
Just because.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.824
Oh my God,
all guys are the same.

29:08.860 --> 29:10.350
What?

29:10.395 --> 29:12.295
l'm not putting on a show
for you, freak.

29:12.330 --> 29:16.061
- No! l didn't mean it like that.
- Then what?

29:16.101 --> 29:18.160
l don't know.
l'm-- nothing.

29:18.203 --> 29:21.434
l'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

29:27.345 --> 29:30.212
- How's that?
- Mm, much better.

29:30.248 --> 29:32.842
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

29:32.884 --> 29:35.580
So your cam is broken, huh?

29:35.620 --> 29:38.384
Yeah, my fucking dog
chomped on it.

29:38.423 --> 29:40.288
l thought your little brother
broke it.

29:40.325 --> 29:43.692
Yeah, he did, and then my dog
took a swipe at it too.

29:43.728 --> 29:45.958
Wow, sucks to be you.

29:45.997 --> 29:48.625
( Josh laughs )
Damn, you're a firecracker.

29:48.667 --> 29:49.998
That's right.

29:50.035 --> 29:52.469
Gotta watch myself
around you, huh?

29:52.504 --> 29:54.734
Uh-huh.

29:54.773 --> 29:57.264
Ah... l like that.

29:57.309 --> 30:00.574
Too many girls just roll over--
like no challenge.

30:00.612 --> 30:02.375
You know a lot of girls, huh?

30:02.414 --> 30:06.111
No. l'm into quality,
not quantity.

30:06.151 --> 30:09.177
Yeah, l'm sure.
l've heard that one before.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.519
l'm serious.
No bullshit.

30:11.556 --> 30:14.081
Yeah well, maybe.

30:14.126 --> 30:17.994
- Maybe what?
- Just maybe.

30:18.029 --> 30:19.519
( Josh sighs )

30:19.564 --> 30:22.965
So you going
to the party tonight?

30:23.001 --> 30:26.937
- l don't know.
- Hmm.

30:26.972 --> 30:28.837
At least you get to see
what l look like.

30:28.874 --> 30:30.865
l already know what you look like.

30:30.909 --> 30:33.070
How?

30:33.111 --> 30:34.772
l have an imagination.

30:34.813 --> 30:36.678
( laughs )
Oh no.

30:36.715 --> 30:38.842
Lexie gave you my picture,
didn't she?

30:38.884 --> 30:41.352
- Maybe.
- Oh my God, busted!

30:41.386 --> 30:43.149
( laughs )
You're such a stalker.

30:43.188 --> 30:46.157
l am not!
l just-- never mind.

30:46.191 --> 30:48.182
Ah. No, that's cool.

30:48.226 --> 30:50.820
l like knowing some chick
thinks l'm dope.

30:50.862 --> 30:52.420
l didn't say l thought
you were dope.

30:52.464 --> 30:54.227
Maybe a dope.

30:54.266 --> 30:56.097
( laughs )
Oh my God.

30:56.134 --> 30:59.865
You've got a mouth on you,
a nice one too.

30:59.905 --> 31:03.033
- You think so?
- Mm, hell yeah.

31:04.442 --> 31:06.000
Aw.
( laughs )

31:06.044 --> 31:07.705
Now you're torturing Skaterdude.

31:07.746 --> 31:10.306
- ( laughs )
- Aw, poor baby.

31:10.348 --> 31:12.145
You're a cool chick.

31:12.184 --> 31:14.209
You should come tonight.
We should hook up.

31:14.252 --> 31:16.243
Maybe.

31:16.288 --> 31:19.121
Come on, l'll be hanging
with my buds by the kitchen.

31:19.157 --> 31:22.456
- You gonna come?
- Maybe.

31:22.494 --> 31:26.487
Mm, okay, Maybe Megan.

31:26.531 --> 31:29.557
- Well, l hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.

31:29.601 --> 31:32.866
- All right. Bye, hot chick.
- Bye.

31:47.285 --> 31:50.254
- ( beeps )
- Hey.

31:50.288 --> 31:52.085
Where are you going?

31:52.123 --> 31:55.615
Um, l decided at the last minute
to go to Tracy's party.

31:55.660 --> 31:58.060
Oh, l thought you weren't
going to go.

31:58.096 --> 32:00.929
Yeah, it's just l was talking
to this kind of cool guy

32:00.966 --> 32:03.764
and he's going to be there,
so l thought l'd check him out.

32:03.802 --> 32:06.965
Oh, okay.

32:07.005 --> 32:09.803
So, yeah.
l'll call you tomorrow?

32:09.841 --> 32:11.809
Yeah, l'll see you tomorrow.

32:11.843 --> 32:14.243
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

32:19.451 --> 32:21.885
Hey, video diary.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.650
lt's me, Amy, again.

32:24.689 --> 32:26.850
Yeah, like who else would it be?

32:32.697 --> 32:34.892
l was going through
some magazines the other day

32:34.933 --> 32:38.926
because l want to find
a nice dress for my prom.

32:38.970 --> 32:42.838
My prom's not for four years away,
but l figured if--

32:42.874 --> 32:45.809
if someone asked me to his,
then l should be prepared.

32:49.347 --> 32:51.907
Hell, like who's going
to ask me, right?

32:54.419 --> 32:56.410
Fuck you.

33:02.827 --> 33:04.454
- ( beeps )
- Yeah?

33:04.496 --> 33:06.157
Hey.

33:06.197 --> 33:08.722
Amy? What time is it?

33:08.767 --> 33:11.861
- 8:00.
- ln the morning?

33:11.903 --> 33:14.269
- Jesus Christ, Amy.
- Sorry.

33:14.306 --> 33:16.240
l was just wondering
how it went with that guy.

33:16.274 --> 33:19.801
- Was he cool?
- He wasn't there, fucking dork.

33:19.844 --> 33:22.870
- l looked for him for four hours.
- That's too bad.

33:22.914 --> 33:26.816
- What was his name?
- Josh, Josh the jerk.

33:26.851 --> 33:28.842
Okay, well, what are you
doing later?

33:28.887 --> 33:31.185
- Sleeping.
- After that?

33:31.222 --> 33:32.484
That's it.

33:32.524 --> 33:34.788
Well, let's go to a movie
or something.

33:34.826 --> 33:37.124
- Okay, call me later.
- Okay. Good night.

33:37.162 --> 33:38.823
Bye.

33:40.465 --> 33:43.195
- ( computer chimes )
- Josh: Hey, hot chick.

33:43.234 --> 33:45.498
How would you know?

33:45.537 --> 33:47.732
Uh-oh, you sound pissed.

33:47.772 --> 33:49.330
Oh no, why would l be pissed?

33:49.374 --> 33:51.308
Just because some jerk
tells me to meet him at a party

33:51.343 --> 33:52.435
and then never shows up?

33:52.477 --> 33:53.774
Why would l be pissed?

33:53.812 --> 33:56.542
- l was there.
- No, you weren't.

33:56.581 --> 33:58.776
l was at that party
for four hours, buddy.

33:58.817 --> 34:00.978
lf you were there,
then you're the invisible man.

34:01.019 --> 34:02.919
l looked like an idiot.

34:02.954 --> 34:04.819
Well, l thought you looked great.

34:04.856 --> 34:08.348
- And how would you know?
- Because l was there.

34:08.393 --> 34:12.556
Okay. lf you were there,
then what was l wearing?

34:12.597 --> 34:15.896
Uh, well, you had on

34:15.934 --> 34:19.563
a really sexy little jean skirt

34:19.603 --> 34:22.471
and a black top with gold trim

34:22.507 --> 34:26.603
and, um, black high-heeled
kind of sandals.

34:26.643 --> 34:31.638
And l think you had
a butterfly clip in your hair.

34:32.717 --> 34:35.583
- You were there.
- Yeah, l told you.

34:35.620 --> 34:38.248
Well, then why didn't
you come up to me?

34:38.289 --> 34:39.779
l saw you looking around.

34:39.824 --> 34:41.882
l figured you were probably
looking for me.

34:41.926 --> 34:44.257
Yeah, l was.

34:44.295 --> 34:48.697
And you looked so great.
l mean you looked incredible.

34:48.733 --> 34:53.067
l totally felt my heart skip a beat
when l saw you.

34:53.103 --> 34:55.004
l guess l just wimped out.

34:55.039 --> 34:57.633
So you watched me?

34:57.675 --> 35:00.075
( laughs )
Yeah. Kind of creepy, huh?

35:00.111 --> 35:03.239
No. lt's kind of nice.

35:03.281 --> 35:06.341
Yeah, l saw you talking
with your friends.

35:06.384 --> 35:08.579
You're really popular.

35:08.620 --> 35:12.249
l didn't want to barge in
and mess things up.

35:12.290 --> 35:15.589
- You're shy.
- Mm, sometimes.

35:15.627 --> 35:18.596
lt's okay.
l get shy too sometimes.

35:18.630 --> 35:21.758
Hmm. You seem like
you're always in control.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.064
No. Sometimes l just don't
know what to do,

35:24.102 --> 35:25.797
so l usually do something stupid.

35:25.837 --> 35:26.826
( Josh chuckles )

35:26.871 --> 35:29.169
( lisping )
Hey well, Stupid is my middle name.

35:29.207 --> 35:31.368
( laughs )

35:31.409 --> 35:35.038
Anyway, l am sorry
l didn't talk to you last night.

35:35.079 --> 35:37.707
lt's okay.
l understand.

35:37.749 --> 35:40.343
- You do?
- Yeah.

35:40.385 --> 35:42.512
But l do wish
l could have met you.

35:42.554 --> 35:45.216
Yeah. Well, there were just
so many people and stuff

35:45.256 --> 35:48.453
and it was like l didn't know
that many people

35:48.493 --> 35:51.462
- and l felt weird and--
- Yeah. Yeah, l understand.

35:52.997 --> 35:56.057
So anyway,
what are you doing today?

35:56.100 --> 35:57.590
Oh, nothing much.

35:57.635 --> 36:00.798
Me and my friend Amy are going to go
see the new Matt Damon movie.

36:00.839 --> 36:03.501
Matt Damon.
You like Matt Damon, huh?

36:03.541 --> 36:05.406
Yeah. What's not to like?

36:05.443 --> 36:08.105
l don't know.
He looks kind of gay to me.

36:08.146 --> 36:10.478
- l don't think so.
- Hmm.

36:10.515 --> 36:13.678
- Well, l bet he can't skateboard.
- You're jealous.

36:13.718 --> 36:15.982
( chuckles )
Of him? Nah.

36:16.020 --> 36:17.715
Yes, you are!
Admit it!

36:17.755 --> 36:19.552
Why would l be jealous
of Matt Damon?

36:19.591 --> 36:22.719
l don't know.
You tell me.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.321
Well, maybe because he gets
to spend time with you today

36:26.364 --> 36:29.595
and l don't.

36:29.634 --> 36:32.933
Well, you could if you ask me.

36:32.971 --> 36:35.496
Okay, then l'm asking you.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.633
- Asking me what?
- ( laughing )

36:37.675 --> 36:39.575
Wow, you don't
make this easy, do you?

36:39.611 --> 36:43.308
- Hey, l'm worth fighting for.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah, you are.

36:43.348 --> 36:46.112
Thank you.

36:46.150 --> 36:50.678
So, Megan, after your date
with Matt Damon,

36:50.722 --> 36:52.349
would you like to meet up

36:52.390 --> 36:54.688
and maybe get some ice cream
or something?

36:54.726 --> 36:56.660
Yes, l would.

36:56.694 --> 36:59.663
Cool.
Well, that was easy.

36:59.697 --> 37:01.961
The movie will be over
around like 7:00.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.594
So do you want to meet us
at the theater?

37:04.636 --> 37:07.969
Uh, you know, l'd love to meet
your friend and everything--

37:08.006 --> 37:09.132
Yeah yeah, it's okay.

37:09.173 --> 37:12.631
Um, why don't you web me later
around like 7:30?

37:12.677 --> 37:14.440
Okay, that sounds good.

37:14.479 --> 37:17.710
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Bye.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.151
- ( beeps )
- Hey.

37:24.188 --> 37:26.486
Hey. Guess who l was
just talking to.

37:26.524 --> 37:28.958
- Lexie?
- No. Josh.

37:28.993 --> 37:31.791
Josh, as in Josh the big fat jerk
who stood you up Josh?

37:31.829 --> 37:33.490
No no, he's not a jerk.
He was just shy.

37:33.531 --> 37:35.999
- For four hours?
- Okay, so he's very shy.

37:36.034 --> 37:38.594
But listen, l was just talking to him
and he's really sensitive.

37:38.636 --> 37:39.898
What did he say?

37:39.938 --> 37:41.735
Well, we were talking about
lots of stuff and, get this,

37:41.773 --> 37:43.570
he remembered everything
l was wearing last night.

37:43.608 --> 37:44.870
Wow. So what are you
going to do?

37:44.909 --> 37:46.342
l'm going to see him tonight
after the movie.

37:46.377 --> 37:47.401
He's going to web me later.

37:47.445 --> 37:49.072
Hey, you want to come over
and say hello?

37:49.113 --> 37:51.673
Um, if you don't think
that's going to be weird.

37:51.716 --> 37:53.445
Um, no.
He's really cool about stuff.

37:53.484 --> 37:55.509
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.

37:55.553 --> 37:57.418
Hey.

37:59.791 --> 38:01.918
Okay, there he is.
Okay, be cool.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.087
- ( computer chimes )
- Hello?

38:04.128 --> 38:06.096
Josh: Hey, Megan.
How was the movie?

38:06.130 --> 38:08.621
- Oh, it was okay.
- Hey, who's that?

38:08.666 --> 38:11.533
- Hey, l'm Megan's best friend Amy.
- Hi, Amy.

38:11.569 --> 38:13.469
l think l might have seen you
around school before.

38:13.504 --> 38:16.940
- l thought you go to Tolland.
- Yeah, l do, when l go to school.

38:16.975 --> 38:19.500
But sometimes l just like
to hang out at Alton

38:19.544 --> 38:21.375
because the girls are prettier.

38:21.412 --> 38:24.210
- And don't you forget it.
- ( Josh chuckles )

38:24.248 --> 38:26.011
So what do you look like?

38:26.050 --> 38:28.211
Oh, Megan didn't show you my pic?

38:28.252 --> 38:30.914
- l don't remember if she did.
- Yes, you do, bitch!

38:30.955 --> 38:33.947
- Don't listen to her, Josh.
- That's okay.

38:33.992 --> 38:36.153
l-- l have another one here
l was going to send you anyway

38:36.194 --> 38:38.162
since my web's broken.

38:38.196 --> 38:40.130
Here it comes.
Hold on.

38:41.966 --> 38:45.231
- Oh, you didn't tell me you surf.
- Yeah, totally.

38:45.269 --> 38:46.930
The waves are awesome
this time of year

38:46.971 --> 38:49.371
because of the currents
coming up from Mexico.

38:49.407 --> 38:52.843
- Does it get cold?
- Nah, l wear a wetsuit.

38:52.877 --> 38:55.368
And also the adrenaline
keeps you warm.

38:55.413 --> 38:58.644
- That sounds really cool.
- Yeah.

38:58.683 --> 39:01.447
So are you two doing
something tonight?

39:01.486 --> 39:03.579
Oh, no.
Actually Amy was just leaving.

39:03.621 --> 39:05.213
Bye, Amy.
See you in school tomorrow.

39:05.256 --> 39:06.917
Bye.

39:06.958 --> 39:08.152
( mouths word )

39:08.192 --> 39:12.026
l saw that, Amy.
( laughs )

39:12.063 --> 39:15.123
So, alone at last.

39:15.166 --> 39:18.260
So you still want to meet up
and do something?

39:18.302 --> 39:20.770
- Sure. Where?
- l don't know.

39:20.805 --> 39:23.933
Why don't we meet behind the diner
in like 20 minutes?

39:23.975 --> 39:27.172
- Behind the diner-- how romantic.
- ( laughs )

39:27.211 --> 39:28.701
Well, if you want to meet
somewhere else--

39:28.746 --> 39:30.475
No, l'm kidding.
l'm sorry.

39:30.515 --> 39:32.483
l can be kind of a smart-ass
sometimes.

39:32.517 --> 39:34.212
Ah, no problemo.

39:34.252 --> 39:36.243
l know how to deal
with smart-asses.

39:36.287 --> 39:39.779
- Oh? And how is that?
- You'll see.

39:39.824 --> 39:41.724
See? lt's always the quiet ones
you have to worry about.

39:41.759 --> 39:43.920
( Josh chuckles )

39:43.961 --> 39:46.361
- l would never hurt you, Megan.
- l know.

39:46.397 --> 39:48.490
- Do you?
- Yes.

39:48.533 --> 39:51.195
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

39:51.235 --> 39:53.465
l trust you too.

39:53.504 --> 39:56.098
So see you in like 20 minutes.

39:56.140 --> 39:58.802
- Okay. Bye, Josh.
- Cool. Bye.

40:40.785 --> 40:42.377
- ( beeps )
- Hello?

40:42.420 --> 40:44.547
- Hey, Kathy, it's Amy.
- l know.

40:44.589 --> 40:46.853
What l don't know
is why you're calling me.

40:46.891 --> 40:48.791
l was just wondering
if you talked to Megan today.

40:48.826 --> 40:49.815
No, l haven't.

40:49.861 --> 40:51.761
Um, l'm kind of busy,
so l'm going to go, okay?

40:51.796 --> 40:54.026
- Bye.
- ( beeps )

40:54.065 --> 40:57.865
( keypad beeping )

40:57.902 --> 40:59.267
- ( beeps )
- Hello?

40:59.303 --> 41:01.066
- Hey, Lexie.
- Hi.

41:01.105 --> 41:03.096
Are you sure you didn't dial
the wrong number?

41:03.141 --> 41:05.234
l know you don't like me,
but l was just wondering

41:05.276 --> 41:06.607
if you saw Megan
in history class today.

41:06.644 --> 41:08.942
Huh-uh.
Well, l-- l gotta go.

41:08.980 --> 41:10.709
- But--
- Bye.

41:14.252 --> 41:16.743
( kids laughing )

41:18.489 --> 41:21.686
- ( computer chimes )
- Hey, Josh.

41:21.726 --> 41:24.456
- Hey. Who's this?
- lt's Amy.

41:24.495 --> 41:27.020
l met you yesterday.
l'm Megan's best friend.

41:27.064 --> 41:29.157
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
How's it going?

41:29.200 --> 41:31.930
Not so good.
Have you heard from Megan at all?

41:31.969 --> 41:34.130
No, l was going to ask you
the same thing.

41:34.172 --> 41:36.504
We were supposed
to get together last night

41:36.541 --> 41:38.702
and she never showed up.

41:38.743 --> 41:42.804
She hasn't been at school all day.
She hasn't called me at all.

41:42.847 --> 41:45.816
Mm, well, l haven't seen her.

41:45.850 --> 41:48.614
l mean do you guys talk
all the time?

41:48.653 --> 41:50.712
Yeah, like every hour.

41:50.755 --> 41:52.985
This is so weird.

41:53.024 --> 41:55.618
You know, maybe she went
somewhere with her mom.

41:55.660 --> 41:58.220
No, Megan and her mom
don't get along.

41:58.262 --> 41:59.456
l don't know, Amy.

41:59.497 --> 42:02.625
l mean we talked and l thought
we got along great.

42:02.667 --> 42:05.830
- And then she never showed up.
- Okay.

42:05.870 --> 42:08.168
Well, if you hear from her,
will you web me?

42:08.206 --> 42:10.197
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Josh.

42:10.241 --> 42:12.232
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:16.447 --> 42:18.574
- ( newscast music playing )
- News anchor: ln America

42:18.616 --> 42:21.278
a child disappears
every 40 seconds.

42:21.319 --> 42:24.413
The police need your help
to solve these crimes.

42:24.455 --> 42:29.188
Over 2,000 times a day
somewhere a mother cries out:

42:33.331 --> 42:36.994
Tonight on ''Missing'':
a beautiful teenage girl,

42:37.034 --> 42:38.797
a desperate mother...

42:38.836 --> 42:40.997
She's a good girl.
Just don't hurt her.

42:41.038 --> 42:43.097
News anchor:
...and a mysterious disappearance.

42:43.140 --> 42:45.836
l don't know. One day she just
didn't show up for school.

42:45.877 --> 42:49.210
ls she a runaway
or is she the victim of foul play?

42:49.247 --> 42:52.512
No matter which way you look
at the facts, one fact remains:

42:54.886 --> 42:57.150
Good evening.
l'm Callie Daniels.

42:57.188 --> 43:00.680
Megan Stewart, a beautiful
popular 14-year-old girl

43:00.725 --> 43:04.217
vanished without a trace after going out
with friends two days ago.

43:04.262 --> 43:06.628
Police have no leads
in the baffling disappearance

43:06.664 --> 43:09.963
of one of Alton High School's
most popular students.

43:10.001 --> 43:12.629
Megan Stewart is by all accounts

43:12.670 --> 43:15.332
one of the shining stars
of Alton High School--

43:15.373 --> 43:18.035
a straight-A student
who devotes her spare time

43:18.075 --> 43:19.975
to helping her community
and her friends.

43:20.011 --> 43:22.878
She's popular with students
and faculty alike.

43:22.914 --> 43:26.111
Megan Stewart is a role model
for many of our students here.

43:26.150 --> 43:29.608
She's active in her community
and a very good student.

43:29.654 --> 43:32.487
Megan's mother, Joyce Stewart,
gave this statement.

43:32.523 --> 43:35.754
l-- l just want her to be
brought back safe

43:35.793 --> 43:37.852
to the people who love her
and miss her.

43:37.895 --> 43:40.989
We asked her friends
if they thought Megan ran away.

43:41.032 --> 43:43.523
- Megan would never run away.
- No. She's like my best friend.

43:43.567 --> 43:45.660
And if something was wrong
in her life, she would tell us.

43:45.703 --> 43:46.863
She would totally.

43:46.904 --> 43:50.305
Whether a runaway, abduction
or other form of foul play,

43:50.341 --> 43:53.276
the one fact remains
that this beautiful young girl

43:53.311 --> 43:55.074
disappeared without a trace.

43:55.112 --> 43:57.580
Police are asking for your help.

43:57.615 --> 44:00.482
Megan Stewart is 5'1'',

44:00.518 --> 44:03.954
105 lbs with dark hair
and hazel eyes.

44:03.988 --> 44:07.651
She was last seen wearing blue jeans
and a maroon blouse.

44:07.692 --> 44:10.593
lf you know anything regarding
the whereabouts of this young girl,

44:10.628 --> 44:12.960
please contact
North Hollywood Police

44:12.997 --> 44:17.434
or you can send anonymous tips

44:17.468 --> 44:20.062
Police are also looking for clues
in the disappearance

44:20.104 --> 44:23.437
of 1 3-year-old Tercel Jackson
who was abducted

44:23.474 --> 44:26.375
from his home in Crenshaw
yesterday afternoon.

44:26.410 --> 44:28.708
Anyone with information
is encouraged to call

44:28.746 --> 44:31.010
the Crenshaw Police Department.

44:31.048 --> 44:33.448
We will be right back with more
on the disappearance

44:33.484 --> 44:36.851
and search for Megan Stewart
after these messages.

44:43.594 --> 44:46.119
lt's been four days
since l've heard from Megan.

44:48.699 --> 44:51.065
l don't think she ran away.

44:51.102 --> 44:54.469
That's what all the news people
are saying.

44:54.505 --> 44:58.100
l don't know what happened,
but l'm worried.

45:00.811 --> 45:02.802
This is so weird.

45:04.448 --> 45:07.781
l keep expecting her
to call me any second.

45:07.818 --> 45:10.378
l sleep with my cell phone
next to my pillow.

45:16.694 --> 45:19.458
l know she's alive.

45:19.497 --> 45:21.727
l can feel it.

45:30.107 --> 45:33.702
A stunning break in the case
of missing teenager Megan Stewart.

45:33.744 --> 45:36.042
Police today released
security camera footage

45:36.080 --> 45:39.413
from the back of a diner
just one mile from where she lived.

45:39.450 --> 45:42.647
The footage clearly shows
that she encounters a man

45:42.686 --> 45:44.779
who appears to lead her away.

45:44.822 --> 45:47.814
Sergeant Jon Simonelli
of District 33 Police Department

45:47.858 --> 45:49.621
had this statement.

45:49.660 --> 45:51.287
Well, we got a lucky break
in the case.

45:51.328 --> 45:53.421
We obtained some
surveillance footage.

45:53.464 --> 45:56.297
And on the videotape it appears
as if she's waiting for someone.

45:56.333 --> 45:59.996
Whether the man she walked away with
was the individual she was waiting for

46:00.037 --> 46:03.336
- is still under investigation.
- So you think she may be a runaway.

46:03.374 --> 46:05.842
Well, we're looking at
all possibilities at the moment.

46:05.876 --> 46:08.640
Anyone with information
is encouraged to contact

46:08.679 --> 46:10.772
the North Hollywood
Police Department.

46:10.815 --> 46:13.841
And when we return,
a pure-bred cocker spaniel

46:13.884 --> 46:16.751
accidentally drives his owner's car
through a store window.

47:18.916 --> 47:21.009
( computer chimes )

47:21.051 --> 47:24.214
- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, cute girl.

47:24.255 --> 47:26.348
Don't say that.

47:26.390 --> 47:29.086
l wouldn't say it if it weren't true.

47:29.126 --> 47:31.117
You don't think you're cute?

47:31.162 --> 47:34.563
- l do.
- l'm all right.

47:34.598 --> 47:36.862
Mm, l think you're sexy.

47:36.901 --> 47:40.462
l think you're one sexy girl.

47:40.504 --> 47:42.995
Was that you in the video?

47:43.040 --> 47:45.099
What, that security video?

47:45.142 --> 47:47.167
That was some old dude.

47:47.211 --> 47:50.203
- So you didn't see her there?
- No.

47:50.247 --> 47:53.808
l think maybe she skipped out
with that guy before l got there.

47:53.851 --> 47:55.716
You know,
she seems kind of flaky.

47:55.753 --> 47:59.519
She wouldn't do that.
She would have told me.

47:59.557 --> 48:01.718
So you two are really close, huh?

48:01.759 --> 48:04.387
Yeah, we are.

48:04.428 --> 48:07.659
lt's funny, you don't seem
like the kind of girl

48:07.698 --> 48:09.689
she would hang with.

48:09.733 --> 48:13.169
- What do you mean?
- You know what l mean.

48:13.204 --> 48:16.662
Just look at yourself.
You know exactly what l mean.

48:16.707 --> 48:19.198
No, l don't.
You just said l was sexy.

48:19.243 --> 48:21.234
Then you're stupid too.

48:21.278 --> 48:23.303
You'll believe anything,
won't you?

48:25.082 --> 48:28.415
l think you know where she is.

48:28.452 --> 48:33.287
Trying to change the conversation
won't change the facts, Amy.

48:33.324 --> 48:35.554
What facts?

48:35.593 --> 48:39.120
That you're fat,
that you have no friends,

48:39.163 --> 48:42.223
that no one finds you attractive.

48:42.266 --> 48:44.666
- l have friends.
- ( laughs )

48:44.702 --> 48:48.536
You have one friend who left
and didn't tell you where she was going

48:48.572 --> 48:50.233
because she didn't
want you tagging along.

48:50.274 --> 48:52.799
No, that's not true.

48:52.843 --> 48:55.676
Would you like
to have friends, Amy?

48:55.713 --> 48:58.705
Would you like to sleep with something
besides your teddy bear?

48:58.749 --> 49:02.048
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.

49:02.086 --> 49:05.613
Do you hug your teddy bear, Amy,
and pretend he's some guy you like

49:05.656 --> 49:08.784
- who's never going to talk to you?
- Shut up.

49:08.826 --> 49:11.818
Because you're some loser
who won't spread her legs?

49:11.862 --> 49:13.887
You don't know anything about me.

49:13.931 --> 49:16.024
You don't know who l am.

49:16.066 --> 49:19.035
l know exactly who you are, Amy.

49:19.069 --> 49:22.903
Megan told me all about you--
how pathetic you are,

49:22.940 --> 49:25.374
how you follow her around
like a little puppy.

49:25.409 --> 49:28.435
You're like a big joke to her.

49:28.479 --> 49:31.915
- What did you do to Megan?
- Nothing.

49:31.949 --> 49:35.009
Nothing she didn't do
with 100 guys before.

49:44.094 --> 49:48.155
Today on ''Missing,'' new revelations
in the case of Megan Stewart,

49:48.198 --> 49:51.429
the North Hollywood teenager
who disappeared over two weeks ago.

49:51.468 --> 49:54.835
Police were given a statement
by 14-year-old Amy Herman,

49:54.872 --> 49:56.840
a close friend of the missing girl.

49:56.874 --> 49:58.364
Reporter:
What did you tell the police?

49:58.409 --> 50:01.037
l just told them about someone
Megan was chatting with online.

50:01.078 --> 50:03.103
- What's this person's name?
- Had she met with this man before?

50:03.147 --> 50:05.672
l'm sorry, but that information is vital
to the ongoing investigation.

50:05.716 --> 50:07.911
Well, now that you've come forward,
do you fear for your own life?

50:07.951 --> 50:10.545
All right, that's it.
No more questions for now.

50:10.587 --> 50:15.251
We have confirmed that Amy Herman
mentioned a man named Josh

50:15.292 --> 50:17.783
who apparently met Megan Stewart
in a chat room

50:17.828 --> 50:20.126
using the nickname Skaterdude.

50:20.164 --> 50:23.099
A complete chronology
of the investigation can be found

50:23.133 --> 50:26.534
at our website:
findmegan.com.

50:26.570 --> 50:29.095
We'll be back
after these messages.

50:32.409 --> 50:34.809
Let me take you on a tour
of some of the places

50:34.845 --> 50:36.540
Megan and l would go to.

50:36.580 --> 50:38.878
l keep thinking
l'll see her somewhere.

50:38.916 --> 50:42.283
l keep hoping l do, at least.
This is a diner.

50:42.319 --> 50:44.184
We always used to come here
after school.

50:44.221 --> 50:47.122
- What are you doing?
- Get that camera out of my face.

50:47.157 --> 50:50.024
l'm not recording you guys.
l'm making a video diary for myself.

50:50.060 --> 50:52.221
About how you messed up
Megan's life, huh?

50:52.262 --> 50:53.251
No--

50:53.297 --> 50:56.027
You know it's because of you
that she's not here, right?

50:56.066 --> 50:57.556
That's not true.

50:57.601 --> 50:59.159
What are you going to do,
sell this?

50:59.203 --> 51:00.568
Are you going to sell this
to the news?

51:00.604 --> 51:03.767
No, l'm-- l'm not going
to sell this to anyone.

51:03.807 --> 51:07.072
You know what?
Stay the fuck out of my face, bitch.

51:09.480 --> 51:11.812
- As you can see l'm very well liked.
- Hey!

51:13.617 --> 51:15.414
You know that
this is all your fault, right?

51:15.452 --> 51:17.511
You think you're hot shit
because she spent

51:17.554 --> 51:19.317
every waking moment with you?

51:19.356 --> 51:20.846
- No, l--
- ls that what you think?

51:20.891 --> 51:22.586
l don't think that.

51:22.626 --> 51:26.084
Fuck.
She loved me!

51:26.130 --> 51:29.622
And l-- l loved her back.
l loved her so much!

51:29.666 --> 51:32.294
And now she's gone
because of you!

51:33.404 --> 51:35.565
This is all your fault

51:35.606 --> 51:38.507
and l can't fix it.

51:38.542 --> 51:41.340
There's nothing l can fucking do.

51:43.414 --> 51:46.315
Get the fuck out of my face.

51:46.350 --> 51:49.547
( crying )
This is all your fault.

51:52.189 --> 51:54.419
Amy: Megan and l used to come
under this bridge

51:54.458 --> 51:56.926
and just talk about stuff.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.053
l remember one time
when it just started to rain

51:59.096 --> 52:00.723
and then it started to pour.

52:00.764 --> 52:04.131
All of a sudden the entire river
was flooded.

52:04.168 --> 52:06.159
We didn't want to tell
anyone about it.

52:06.203 --> 52:08.831
We thought people might think
we were stupid.

52:08.872 --> 52:10.863
l guess we kind of were.

52:17.548 --> 52:20.244
Megan's so adventurous.

52:20.284 --> 52:23.447
She's not afraid to try things
and she doesn't care

52:23.487 --> 52:25.512
what other people think
about her.

52:27.391 --> 52:29.791
l wish l was more like her.

52:29.827 --> 52:31.920
l'm going to show you something.

52:40.871 --> 52:42.463
This is Billy Bear.

52:42.506 --> 52:45.202
l've had him since l was like five.

52:45.242 --> 52:47.233
Three years ago my mom
wanted me to get rid of him

52:47.277 --> 52:51.043
because he was all ragged,
but l just couldn't.

52:51.081 --> 52:54.517
So l keep him here and l can
visit him whenever l want.

52:57.087 --> 52:59.749
People keep saying
how this experience

52:59.790 --> 53:01.985
is supposed
to help me grow up,

53:02.025 --> 53:07.361
but... l don't understand that.

53:07.397 --> 53:10.332
lf anything, it's making me
not want to grow up.

53:11.668 --> 53:14.159
There's so much weirdness
out there.

53:16.406 --> 53:19.807
l'd just-- l'd just rather
stay here with Billy.

53:32.656 --> 53:36.057
( keyboard clicking )

53:36.093 --> 53:39.290
( computer chimes )

53:39.329 --> 53:40.990
Who is this?

53:41.031 --> 53:45.832
- Josh: l think you know.
- Josh?

53:45.869 --> 53:49.805
You have a big mouth.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.001
l didn't say you
kidnapped Megan.

53:52.042 --> 53:56.069
No. You just said
you think l did.

53:56.113 --> 54:00.550
Well, if you didn't,
you have nothing to worry about.

54:00.584 --> 54:03.144
l don't have anything
to worry about.

54:03.186 --> 54:04.676
They can't find me.

54:04.721 --> 54:08.680
You can set up
free screen names anywhere.

54:08.725 --> 54:11.193
What do you want from me?

54:11.228 --> 54:16.029
l want you to shut
your big fucking mouth.

54:16.066 --> 54:18.591
And if you still feel like
yakking to the police,

54:18.635 --> 54:23.095
l may have to pay you a visit
or your mom.

54:23.140 --> 54:26.439
l'm watching you, Amy.

54:48.131 --> 54:51.532
Tonight a special
''Megan is Missing'' reenactment

54:51.568 --> 54:54.901
based on analysis of the original
security camera footage.

54:54.938 --> 54:56.929
We must warn you
that some material

54:56.974 --> 55:00.068
may be too intense
for younger viewers.

55:00.110 --> 55:02.670
Well, we're filming the reenactment
of an abduction

55:02.713 --> 55:05.739
and we're doing it actually
on the exact location

55:05.782 --> 55:07.773
where the girl was abducted.

55:07.818 --> 55:12.414
You want to find the truth
and we believe an accurate reenactment

55:12.456 --> 55:15.892
in the same location
might bring about some clues

55:15.926 --> 55:19.259
that the police really haven't
been able to touch on themselves.

55:19.296 --> 55:21.958
l-- l just-- l think
this is so important.

55:21.999 --> 55:25.730
And l want to do anything
l could do to help out.

55:25.769 --> 55:28.863
l mean l can't even imagine
that this happened.

55:28.905 --> 55:31.499
lt is difficult playing
someone as awful as this,

55:31.541 --> 55:34.704
but you look past
your personal feelings

55:34.745 --> 55:36.713
and just try to make it real
for the audience.

55:36.747 --> 55:39.716
When l was a lot younger l spent
a lot of time on the internet.

55:39.750 --> 55:41.274
lt's not a safe space.

55:41.318 --> 55:44.879
As much as you feel safe
in your own home, you're not safe.

55:44.921 --> 55:48.721
And now a ''Megan is Missing''
exclusive reenactment.

55:50.727 --> 55:52.718
Hey, Mom, it's me.
l'm going to go to the store

55:52.763 --> 55:54.390
and get some groceries
for breakfast.

55:54.431 --> 55:57.195
So l'll see you soon. Bye.

56:01.038 --> 56:02.938
( echoing )
You're trespassing.

56:02.973 --> 56:04.964
Come with me.

56:08.879 --> 56:11.439
Stop! No, please!
Please!

56:11.481 --> 56:16.418
Stop! Stop!
( screaming )

56:23.794 --> 56:26.490
The brutal abduction
of a beautiful young girl.

56:26.530 --> 56:28.020
We'll be right back.

57:03.834 --> 57:07.167
lt's been three weeks now.

57:07.204 --> 57:10.332
l can feel the people searching
for Megan are starting to give up.

57:10.373 --> 57:12.364
They're not trying anymore

57:12.409 --> 57:15.674
and it's really hard
to get volunteers.

57:17.481 --> 57:19.949
l think that they might
think she's dead.

57:22.419 --> 57:24.546
Maybe l do too.

57:39.336 --> 57:42.669
Tonight a shocking twist
in the case of Megan Stewart.

57:42.706 --> 57:46.699
The missing girl's best friend,
Amy Herman, has now vanished.

57:46.743 --> 57:48.973
Are the girls the victims
of the same kidnapper

57:49.012 --> 57:50.946
or have they simply
run away together?

57:50.981 --> 57:53.506
Detective Jon Simonelli
had this to say.

57:53.550 --> 57:55.984
Obviously the coincidence
of both girls,

57:56.019 --> 57:58.487
who were friends,
disappearing is enormous.

57:58.522 --> 58:01.082
We're working all possible
scenarios at this time.

58:01.124 --> 58:04.992
A baffling case that grows
more bizarre by the hour.

58:05.028 --> 58:06.893
We'll be right back.

58:09.633 --> 58:11.794
lt has been two days
since the disappearance

58:11.835 --> 58:15.032
of 15-year-old Amy Herman
and 23 days

58:15.071 --> 58:18.802
since her best friend Megan Stewart
was abducted behind a local diner.

58:18.842 --> 58:21.709
Their friends have started a campaign
to persuade everyone

58:21.745 --> 58:25.078
to tie pink ribbons on trees
as a symbol of hope.

58:26.550 --> 58:28.415
We're doing
this pink ribbon campaign

58:28.451 --> 58:30.646
to let Megan know that we love her
and we miss her.

58:30.687 --> 58:33.315
And hopefully it'll make
whoever took her, you know,

58:33.356 --> 58:35.017
feel bad and let her go.

58:35.058 --> 58:37.117
Yvette: Search parties
continue to examine

58:37.160 --> 58:39.287
the wooded area surrounding
the two girls' homes

58:39.329 --> 58:41.797
for any leads
as to their whereabouts.

58:41.832 --> 58:44.562
Earlier today l spoke
with Amy's parents.

58:44.601 --> 58:46.626
We'd like to thank
all the volunteers

58:46.670 --> 58:51.607
that have spent so many hours
searching for Amy.

58:51.641 --> 58:55.099
We believe in our hearts
that she's well

58:55.145 --> 58:57.909
and that she will be
returned to us.

58:57.948 --> 59:00.974
Princess, if you can--
if you can hear me,

59:01.017 --> 59:04.851
we love you
and we're praying for you.

59:15.465 --> 59:18.161
Chief, we've got something here.

59:18.201 --> 59:21.602
Frank, get the camera.
Get the camera, Frank.

59:21.638 --> 59:24.664
Man: Tell those guys to stop.
Hold up. Hold up right there.

59:52.068 --> 59:54.696
( no audible dialogue )

01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:14.247
- ( Amy screams )
- ( banging )

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:19.354
Help!
Somebody help!

01:00:19.396 --> 01:00:23.423
Somebody please!
Please!

01:00:23.466 --> 01:00:28.028
Please help!
( crying )

01:00:28.071 --> 01:00:32.872
Please, help me!
Help me!

01:00:36.947 --> 01:00:40.713
Why are you doing this to me?

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.274
Please.
