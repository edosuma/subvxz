00:03.737 --> 00:05.270
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:08.240
<i>Was a child,</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:11.577
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.246 --> 00:16.148
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.150 --> 00:17.750
To save herself and her people,

00:17.752 --> 00:21.053
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.622
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire--</i>

00:23.624 --> 00:25.524
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>

00:25.526 --> 00:27.459
<i>Forces of the heart.</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:29.795
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:32.032 --> 00:34.366
<i>Previously on</i> reign:

00:34.368 --> 00:35.701
You're holding me prisoner?
Guarded, day and night,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.603
Or at least until
I'm back from rome.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.105
Sebastian, if this girl
is pregnant with your child...

00:40.107 --> 00:42.374
The child is not mine. No one
knows of our true connection.

00:42.376 --> 00:46.278
But if they learn
that a traitor was my uncle...
You can never be king.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.647
There's something wrong
with isabel!

00:48.649 --> 00:50.149
Promise you'll care
for the baby.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.817
Find her a home
and a family.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.119
Bash: Hide her existence among
the other children you care for.

00:54.121 --> 00:56.755
I'll say nothing.
Mary: Did you see
the baby's foot?

00:56.757 --> 00:59.158
It's a mark that pagans
sometimes put on their newborns.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.460
Will the mark fade?
Eventually.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.096
Let's pray that
eventually comes soon.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.236
Mary: Thank you, jeanne,
for taking care of her...

01:11.238 --> 01:14.373
And for keeping quiet about it.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.575
I'm sorry I can't tell you
the mother's name,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.811
But a child born
out of wedlock...

01:18.813 --> 01:20.345
I understand.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.481
Poor lady, she'd be disgraced...

01:22.483 --> 01:24.716
But I've kept the baby
well-hidden in the stables.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.120
Could you give us
a minute alone, please?

01:28.122 --> 01:30.255
Of course, your grace.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.191
(baby murmuring)

01:32.193 --> 01:34.460
(whispering):
Hi...

01:43.369 --> 01:44.603
The mark is fading.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.172
In a few days,
it will be gone,

01:47.174 --> 01:49.174
And then we can
take her to a convent.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.676
Meanwhile, that little mark

01:50.678 --> 01:52.711
Could lead to questions
we can't answer.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.713
What if they put this
together with isabel,

01:54.715 --> 01:56.215
If they learned
she was my cousin?

01:56.217 --> 01:59.618
Once, my pagan ties only put
me in danger, but now...

01:59.620 --> 02:03.288
Imagine the response to a
heretic king on the throne.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.490
We'd both be targets.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.459
(sighs)

02:07.461 --> 02:09.161
I don't like
putting you at risk.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.796
Every day this baby's
in the castle...

02:10.798 --> 02:13.165
It's going to be all right.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.800
I talked to agnes,
our wet nurse's mother.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.201
She's been helping
care for the baby.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.337
(sighs)
she agreed to take the child

02:18.339 --> 02:19.805
To her village for a few days.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.173
By then, the mark will be gone

02:21.175 --> 02:23.242
And agnes can take her
on to a convent.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.544
Francis would have offered you
a life without these risks.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.612
We're being careful...

02:26.614 --> 02:28.714
And we're lucky.

02:28.716 --> 02:32.651
We only have to protect the baby
from servants' gossip.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.253
Henry is away in rome,

02:34.255 --> 02:36.221
Catherine is locked
in her tower,

02:36.223 --> 02:37.389
And <i>you</i> are the regent.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.658
My lord, my lady,
news...

02:39.660 --> 02:42.261
Henry's back, and they say
he's brought medicis with him.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.533
♪

02:48.701 --> 02:51.270
(flies buzzing)

02:58.244 --> 03:01.246
Oh! My family!

03:01.248 --> 03:03.615
Oh, francesca.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.616
Oh! Pietro.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.552
You got my letters.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.320
(sighs)
I'm horrified, my dear.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.588
(sighs)
I know.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.623
(gasps)
but now I have you to thank

03:11.625 --> 03:13.792
For making this place fit
for a human being.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.294
(gasps)

03:17.263 --> 03:19.331
My darling girl,
we bring mixed tidings.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.600
As you urged in your letters,
our family has thrown

03:21.602 --> 03:24.436
Its considerable weight
against this annulment

03:24.438 --> 03:25.637
Of your marriage to henry.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.673
And were you successful?

03:27.675 --> 03:30.242
Yes. Under our pressure,
the pope refused to see henry.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.843
Excellent.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.546
So henry has returned here
with the aim of killing you.

03:35.915 --> 03:36.949
He can't.

03:36.951 --> 03:39.351
He has no legal justification!

03:39.353 --> 03:41.320
He's accused you of adultery.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.322
That's a treasonable offense.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.690
If found guilty,
you would pay with...

03:50.363 --> 03:53.332
Pietro:
They say one or two
of henry viii's wives

03:53.334 --> 03:54.933
Practiced laying
their head on a block,

03:54.935 --> 03:57.669
So they could face
the end with dignity.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.371
But, of course,
it will never come to that.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.340
Absolutely not.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.376
We will be here to see
any charges are fairly disputed.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.712
And we've arranged that
you may leave the tower,

04:06.714 --> 04:09.648
Under guard,
to prepare your defense.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.318
But, just in case...

04:14.687 --> 04:16.555
Catherine:
This is ridiculous.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.324
Who am I accused of being
adulterous with?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.297
You meant it, didn't you?

04:25.299 --> 04:26.932
If I say these things
at the court,

04:26.934 --> 04:28.533
You'll find me
a suitable husband?

04:28.535 --> 04:30.469
Yes, I promise.
Now try to concentrate.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.837
Were they naked?

04:35.541 --> 04:36.942
Well, that wouldn't be
believable, would it?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.478
And how do you know
how far they went?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.614
The queen screamed in pleasure.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.284
Lady kenna, I'm not sure...
No, no, no.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.952
I like that. Let catherine
scramble for her dignity.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.420
Catherine tried
to poison me once.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.588
You could tell them
that in court.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.456
No one cares, kenna.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.725
That part's true.
My dear henry's only

04:53.727 --> 04:55.627
Interested in offenses
against himself.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.432
Aren't you supposed to wait
outside the door,

05:00.434 --> 05:02.601
So I can conduct
my defense privately?

05:08.408 --> 05:10.375
(sighs)

05:10.377 --> 05:11.410
Off with you, child.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.478
You've killed me
enough for one day.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.884
Did you miss me?

05:18.886 --> 05:20.085
This is judicial
murder, henry.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.553
We all know
how this plays out

05:21.555 --> 05:23.755
When a king tries
to cast off a queen.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.358
I'll have a line of witnesses
to your adultery a mile long,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.894
All eager to say whatever
I want them to say.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.896
Nobles, servants,
stable boys,

05:30.898 --> 05:32.998
The man who clips the hedges in
the garden, it doesn't matter.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.568
Twist and squirm all you want;
you can't outlast them,

05:36.570 --> 05:38.503
Because I'll have
another, and another.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.572
All to wed mary
to your bastard son,

05:40.574 --> 05:43.075
And get her to stake her claim
to the english throne.

05:43.077 --> 05:46.044
(sighs)
it won't look good, henry.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.913
You're doing all this
for England.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.715
You're killing me for England.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.583
When you go back
to the vatican all set

05:51.585 --> 05:54.386
To legitimize bash, you need
to give them a fig leaf.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.621
You need the appearance
of fairness.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.024
So that you and the pope
don't look like

05:59.026 --> 06:00.559
The power-hungry
bastards you are.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.027
Oh, my hands will be clean.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.862
I'm keeping a distance.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.432
The evidence against you will
be collected by my old friend.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.569
You remember viscount
richard delacroix?

06:12.605 --> 06:15.474
It takes a special kind
of vindictiveness

06:15.476 --> 06:17.943
To kill a woman over
a petty slight from years ago.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.811
Petty?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.546
You exiled me from court.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.448
You should never have
referred to your queen

06:23.450 --> 06:24.683
As an "italian horse."

06:24.685 --> 06:26.451
I didn't.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.453
I called you an "italian mule."

06:28.455 --> 06:30.522
Henry (laughs):
I'm sure you never stopped

06:30.524 --> 06:33.558
To notice, but you have made a
lot more enemies than just me.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.461
And now the time's come to pay.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.536
(woman gasps)
man: Your majesty.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.804
Women:
Your majesty.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.739
Woman: Your majesty,
you're back.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.908
Your majesty shines like
the sun upon our humble...

06:49.910 --> 06:51.510
Yes, bernard.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.145
Where are we?

06:53.147 --> 06:55.180
Gervaise has taken
back his request

06:55.182 --> 06:56.982
To dedicate his
new play to you,

06:56.984 --> 06:58.917
For fear of
offending the king.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.586
Martin assumes his
dancers are canceled,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.422
And is preparing
to move on to padua.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.158
Everyone! Your attention.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.460
The queen of France
wants it known

07:08.462 --> 07:11.596
That nothing will be canceled.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.098
The money will
continue to flow.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.600
The arts in France live,

07:15.602 --> 07:17.436
As long as
catherine de medici lives,

07:17.438 --> 07:21.072
And I intend that
to be a long, long time.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.909
(all applaud)

07:23.911 --> 07:25.744
Now, let's not make that a lie.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.814
Ah, charlotte, a word.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.515
Is it bad, your grace?

07:30.517 --> 07:31.650
It's worse than bad.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.084
Henry will have my head,

07:33.086 --> 07:35.754
And I can't win if
I fight him legally.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.923
Then I trust your grace
has another strategy.

07:37.925 --> 07:41.526
Well, my best chance, my only
chance, is to destroy sebastian.

07:41.528 --> 07:44.496
That way, henry will have to
turn to francis as the next heir

07:44.498 --> 07:46.932
And there'll be
no need to kill me.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.768
There must be something I can
use to destroy the bastard.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.971
We've watched him,
your grace, as you ordered.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.706
Janet says that
for the last few days,

07:54.708 --> 07:56.842
Bash and mary have spent
an unusual amount of time

07:56.844 --> 07:57.943
In the wine cellar.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.878
Danielle told me

07:59.880 --> 08:02.481
That she saw mary talking
to the wet nurse,

08:02.483 --> 08:05.550
And the wet nurse
going down to the stables...

08:05.552 --> 08:06.518
Several times.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.553
(chuckles)

08:08.555 --> 08:10.021
The physician said
to leave the bandage on

08:10.023 --> 08:11.623
For another three days.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.658
Do not remove it until then;
not for any reason.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.060
When the burn is healed,
you can take the child

08:15.062 --> 08:16.528
To the convent
of st. Clare.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.562
Have no fear, your grace.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.897
Babies are nothing new to me.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.832
I've delivered
dozens in my time.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.704
Be on your way, agnes.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.607
Your majesty,
I'm surprised to see you here.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.775
Yes, I thought a ride
might clear my head.

08:30.777 --> 08:33.612
But you're not wearing
your riding habit.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.947
Oh, how foolish.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.048
I should have changed.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.818
(gasps)
what...

08:39.820 --> 08:41.887
A beautiful baby.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.755
Grandchild, agnes?

08:43.757 --> 08:47.092
Orphan, left at
the castle door.
Mm.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.127
Agnes is taking her to the
convent. Isn't that right?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.596
Yes, your grace.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.900
Babies are such a sign
of hope in dark times.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.067
Oh, I hope nothing's wrong,

08:56.069 --> 08:57.569
Is there?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.076
Jeanne, dear, go away.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.978
Queen mary and I need
to have a little talk.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.218
That's a pagan child.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.186
No doubt the mother
was pagan as well.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.821
I'm not sure what
you're imagining.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.324
So what would this make bash
in the eyes of the nobles?

09:19.326 --> 09:23.194
The fact that he's kept
that mark secret...

09:23.196 --> 09:26.164
The timing of the birth,
which will foster suspicion.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.733
Half of them don't want him
as their king as it is.

09:28.735 --> 09:33.104
Rumors are deadly to a
man in that position.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.043
Rumors are deadly
for a queen as well.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.345
Yes, I'm a good
object lesson, aren't I?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.714
If henry can cut off my head

09:42.716 --> 09:44.849
Based on rumors
he creates himself,

09:44.851 --> 09:48.286
Imagine what would happen
to bash with actual evidence.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.590
One look at that baby,

09:51.592 --> 09:52.958
And bash's enemies will say,

09:52.960 --> 09:54.926
"where there's smoke,
there's fire."

09:54.928 --> 09:58.196
At best, they'll pull him
off the throne

09:58.198 --> 10:00.198
And you'll lose the alliance.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.067
At worst...

10:02.069 --> 10:04.803
Well, by the time
they're finished...

10:04.805 --> 10:06.972
You could end up
on a stake beside him,

10:06.974 --> 10:09.608
My dear,
if you aren't careful.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.142
I'm not threatening you.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.612
I'm giving you a chance
to run home to your mother

10:13.614 --> 10:15.313
And let bash be
what he's always been,

10:15.315 --> 10:16.881
A playmate to henry.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.617
Otherwise...

10:18.619 --> 10:21.052
Well yes, then I am
threatening you.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.756
It will be hard
to destroy us both,

10:24.758 --> 10:26.891
When you are
without your head.

10:26.893 --> 10:30.629
(laughs)
so it's to be a race, is it?

10:30.631 --> 10:31.963
Well, I seek to pull down bash

10:31.965 --> 10:33.798
From the perch
he does not deserve.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.701
You can help henry
trip me into my grave.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.403
Which one of us
will crush the other first?

10:38.405 --> 10:39.971
I wonder.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.408
When the ax falls on your neck,
I will be there...

10:43.410 --> 10:45.110
With bash...

10:45.112 --> 10:47.012
The next king of France.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.402
Hello, old friend.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.203
Too bad you didn't see
this one coming.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.273
Somehow I never see anything
coming that could help me.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.775
(sighs)

11:16.777 --> 11:18.743
So, we're lovers now, are we?

11:18.745 --> 11:20.779
Well, henry was never

11:20.781 --> 11:23.314
Very imaginative.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.786
(breathing heavily)

11:27.788 --> 11:31.456
You've read books
on pagan law.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.358
You probably understand
more about it than anyone

11:33.360 --> 11:35.360
Who isn't a pagan themselves.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.463
Tell me, have you ever thought
sebastian might know more about

11:38.465 --> 11:41.066
What goes on in the forest
than a good catholic should?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.768
He seems well-informed.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.470
But then, he's a woodsman.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.005
He hunts game there.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.974
It's reasonable to think
he might see things.

11:49.976 --> 11:53.178
Are you aiming to use bash
as your way out of this?

11:56.949 --> 11:58.783
Are you keeping
your own counsel

11:58.785 --> 12:00.485
Because a man marked
for questioning

12:00.487 --> 12:02.721
Might betray your secrets?

12:02.723 --> 12:06.024
(sighs)
I'm sorry our friendship
has made you a target.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.460
No harm done yet.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.729
They've only given me
a look at the instruments.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.397
(door clanks open)

12:15.468 --> 12:18.870
Ah! The guilty couple
together again.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.238
It isn't funny, henry.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.873
It might be a little funny,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.775
If you're the only one
who suffers.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.743
Nostradamus...

12:24.745 --> 12:26.845
I've come to offer you a deal.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.246
If you'll say
that you

12:28.248 --> 12:30.048
And my wife have been
having an affair,

12:30.050 --> 12:31.516
I'll show mercy.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.251
Instead of death,
your punishment

12:33.253 --> 12:34.753
Will be exile from France.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.021
Is that so bad?

12:37.023 --> 12:39.357
You can pretend
to tell fortunes

12:39.359 --> 12:40.925
In germany or Spain.

12:44.396 --> 12:45.764
I think not.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.866
Henry:
Well, there you are.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.201
Loyalty's an odd thing.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.070
Heaven knows how you
engender it, my dear.

12:55.274 --> 12:59.277
Catherine: You must see
how frustrating this is.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.347
Clearly, you're in
mary's confidence.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.849
It was your own mother
who took the baby away.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.284
You must know
where they've gone.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.787
The convent of st. Clare,
your majesty.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.890
Yes, but we've been
to the convent of st. Clare,

13:11.892 --> 13:13.324
And there was no baby.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.261
Where else would they go?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.196
Where does your mother live?

13:26.906 --> 13:29.841
I dislike leaving you in the
hands of my family, jeanne.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.010
Sometimes they
lack my patience.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.914
But I simply don't have the time
to cajole the answers from you.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.521
Bash:
<i>The risks catherine</i>
<i>talked about</i>

13:43.523 --> 13:44.856
Are real.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.825
You could marry me,

13:46.827 --> 13:48.526
And I could be pulled down
from the throne.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.296
Or we could try for England
and both lose our heads.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.897
Do you want to withdraw?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.299
Give up our plans,

13:54.301 --> 13:55.466
The legitimization?

13:55.468 --> 13:57.836
No. No. I'm committed.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.170
But I want you to commit.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.206
I have.
Politically.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.976
Is a political reward enough
to justify the risks?

14:04.978 --> 14:07.145
It's not for me, and I don't
believe it is for you.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.314
Mary...

14:09.316 --> 14:11.149
(sighs) since childhood,
you were told that

14:11.151 --> 14:13.484
Francis... Was your destiny.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.154
Have you ever considered
what might have been,

14:16.156 --> 14:19.591
If I were the dauphin
when you came to court

14:19.593 --> 14:21.125
Instead of my brother?

14:23.629 --> 14:25.597
If you came with
your heart open...

14:25.599 --> 14:27.999
Ready to love me?

14:29.468 --> 14:30.902
(door clanks open)

14:30.904 --> 14:32.237
Oh, mary, it's terrible.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.471
Jeanne, the wet nurse...

14:44.450 --> 14:47.352
We were gentle,
as you wished.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.120
Our men simply stretched her
a bit on the rack.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.355
And?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.923
Her mother lives in peronne.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.258
I've already sent horsemen.

15:00.966 --> 15:04.068
She's all right now.
I saw her in the infirmary.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.570
But she said to tell you
that she's worried.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.672
She said, "they know where
my mother took the baby."

15:07.674 --> 15:09.240
They'll have
sent men already.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.942
We must get there first.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.443
The medicis don't know
this countryside.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.912
They'll have to
follow a map,

15:13.914 --> 15:15.046
Go by road.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.981
We'll cut over the hills.

15:32.031 --> 15:35.233
(inhales deeply)

15:35.235 --> 15:37.201
Clarissa (whispering): You're
going to get what you deserve.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.970
You and nostradamus.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.575
Who are you, ghost?

15:44.577 --> 15:45.977
Why are you here?

15:49.982 --> 15:51.549
Come out into the light.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.618
Where we can all see you!

15:53.620 --> 15:57.221
(catherine gasping)

15:57.223 --> 15:59.023
(panting)

16:03.295 --> 16:05.630
I haven't accepted
the king's offer.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.065
I won't betray you.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.233
I wonder if you've
already betrayed me.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.203
Tell me about the castle ghost.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.172
Who, contrary to what
you've repeatedly told me,

16:14.174 --> 16:16.007
Is not really a ghost.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.075
You've seen her?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.476
And touched her
bony little arm.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.978
Well, she has
a grudge against me,

16:19.980 --> 16:21.145
And you, too, it seems.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.981
But you knew that, I'm sure!

16:22.983 --> 16:24.515
Her name is
clarissa.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.719
She's forged a bond with mary.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.420
Sees herself as mary's defender.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.590
(sighs) so, of course,
she sees me as a threat.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.259
And yet you have been
hiding this danger from me.

16:35.261 --> 16:38.062
How long has she been
lurking in shadows,

16:38.064 --> 16:39.597
Listening to god knows what?!

16:39.599 --> 16:42.066
I feel responsible for her.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.471
It was the year of
the great storm.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.041
My father came home
through the floods

16:50.043 --> 16:51.476
With a newborn in his arms.

16:53.145 --> 16:56.381
He wanted to see if he
could correct her face.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.182
"correct" it?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.284
As the villagers said,

17:00.286 --> 17:02.487
"she was kissed by the devil."

17:03.789 --> 17:05.289
You mean she had a birthmark?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.492
Going up along one cheek.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.164
The mother insisted
the mark be removed.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.099
And my father...

17:15.101 --> 17:16.768
Liked to experiment.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.139
He tried to remove it.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.107
First, surgically...

17:23.109 --> 17:24.709
Then with potions.

17:24.711 --> 17:28.146
He managed to peel and
dissolve some of the stain,

17:28.148 --> 17:31.282
But the... The wounds putrefied.

17:31.284 --> 17:34.786
By the time he stopped,
she was horribly deformed.

17:36.722 --> 17:37.789
(sighs)

17:39.458 --> 17:42.160
He didn't tell
the mother this?

17:42.162 --> 17:43.394
As soon as it went wrong,

17:43.396 --> 17:46.364
He hurried to cover his failure.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.166
He told her the baby had died.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.202
Of natural causes.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.472
And he ordered me to expose
the child in the woods.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.207
Why did you disobey?

17:56.209 --> 18:00.244
Perhaps I know what
it's like to be a freak.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.114
I found a couple
willing to take her in.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.549
Paid them what I could.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.151
And yet, she ended up here.

18:08.821 --> 18:12.857
Some of the villagers said
she was marked by the devil.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.294
Children tormented her.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.629
They laughed, threw stones.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.231
Then one day, she broke.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.567
She tackled a boy,

18:22.569 --> 18:24.769
And nearly beat him
half to death.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.171
So you brought this...

18:27.173 --> 18:29.674
Wretched, tortured savage here?

18:29.676 --> 18:31.275
To live in the shadows?

18:31.277 --> 18:34.212
The shadows
are the only life she has.

18:45.324 --> 18:49.293
I hear tomorrow's
a big day for me.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.562
There was another option--
you rejected it.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.499
My hands are tied.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.767
Who ties the hands
of the king?

18:56.769 --> 18:59.537
Other than a select
lusty few?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.305
You know...

19:01.307 --> 19:04.142
I feel better about
this all the time.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.144
Really, henry, is this
the best you could do?

19:06.146 --> 19:08.846
Adultery,
with the court seer.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.548
Even the way
I put you to death...

19:10.550 --> 19:12.550
Fails to meet your standards.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.285
Well, perhaps you're right.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.587
It's just hard to picture you
in the arms of anyone

19:16.589 --> 19:18.256
You're not obliged
to sleep with

19:18.258 --> 19:20.758
For reasons of state.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.794
You're incapable of love,
I know that well enough.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.864
So that's the lie that you tell
yourself to justify all this.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.267
However our marriage began...

19:29.269 --> 19:31.235
We came to love each other
in those first years.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.204
Don't pretend that we didn't.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.207
Yes. That was a charming
illusion you created...

19:36.209 --> 19:38.309
Until you tired of it
and pushed me away.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.178
I pushed you away?!

19:40.180 --> 19:41.312
(sighs)

19:41.314 --> 19:45.249
Who brought diane
back to court?

19:45.251 --> 19:48.319
Who had her pointedly in
his lap during that meeting

19:48.321 --> 19:51.322
With the german ambassador?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.291
Yes, I was childish.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.661
I was young, and a man
doesn't respond well

19:56.663 --> 19:59.664
When his wife uses him as
a studhorse to sire offspring.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.499
I was saving my life.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.668
Ten years without a child!

20:03.670 --> 20:06.437
How many queens have been
tossed aside, or beheaded

20:06.439 --> 20:08.639
For not providing an heir?!

20:08.641 --> 20:10.408
My family warned me
ahead of time...

20:10.410 --> 20:12.410
Oh, let's not bring
the damn medicis into this!

20:12.412 --> 20:14.512
You are the one who wanted
me to perform with

20:14.514 --> 20:16.347
Quack medicines from half
the doctors in europe,

20:16.349 --> 20:19.584
But without the slightest hint
of tenderness, or even liking.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.818
I hurt your feelings.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.986
The man
who would have

20:21.988 --> 20:23.487
Had me killed
and found another queen

20:23.489 --> 20:25.523
Was annoyed
because I'm trying to...

20:25.525 --> 20:26.791
I would not have killed you!

20:26.793 --> 20:28.292
Or put you aside!

20:29.995 --> 20:31.929
I was in love with you.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.399
Could you not have trusted me?

20:35.401 --> 20:36.434
(whispering):
Trust you?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.369
You're killing me now!

20:38.371 --> 20:40.004
We are not the same people.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.008
Maybe I had something
to do with that.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.713
Trust does not
come easily to me.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.381
(catherine sighs)

20:50.383 --> 20:52.316
I was always taught
that love was delusion.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.318
That people love what
you can give them,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.454
And a queen...

20:58.423 --> 21:00.324
...What's the use
of might-have-beens?

21:01.560 --> 21:03.561
It's too late.

21:03.563 --> 21:07.698
Those two naive children
are dead now.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.802
We killed them.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.807
Did we?

21:19.544 --> 21:22.780
Let down your hair.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.483
Let me look at you.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.478
(knocking)

21:54.480 --> 21:57.648
Welcome, your
grace, my lord.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.350
This is my nephew, andrew.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.686
Are you here to see the baby?

22:01.688 --> 22:02.987
She's in the
next room.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.422
I just got her to sleep.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.425
Of course, my lady.
Where would she be?

22:07.427 --> 22:08.859
No one's come asking
about her?

22:08.861 --> 22:11.829
No, my lord.
Oh, we're in time, then.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.498
Agnes, we're here to take
the baby away, and it might

22:14.500 --> 22:16.834
Be a good idea for you and
your nephew to leave, as well.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.868
Just for a while.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.370
If you don't, then...

22:19.372 --> 22:20.738
You-you might be questioned.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.009
There are people
searching for the baby,

22:25.011 --> 22:26.877
And if they don't find her,

22:26.879 --> 22:29.480
They might think that you can
tell them where she is.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.015
Questioned? Who would want...?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.351
(horse neighing,
hoofbeats approaching)

22:35.954 --> 22:37.955
(quietly):
At least six horses.

22:46.965 --> 22:49.400
Medicis.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.802
If they find us, they won't need
the baby. They can kill us here,

22:51.804 --> 22:53.104
Now, where no one will know.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.538
And won't that solve

22:54.540 --> 22:55.806
All catherine's problems!

22:55.808 --> 22:57.608
Agnes, do you have another door?

22:57.610 --> 22:59.643
Or a window
in the back?

22:59.645 --> 23:00.878
Somewhere to hide, then?

23:01.813 --> 23:02.880
There must be somewhere.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.015
If those men find us,

23:05.017 --> 23:07.551
Queen mary and me won't be
the only people to die here.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.853
They'll have to kill you

23:08.855 --> 23:09.954
And your nephew.
Oh.

23:09.956 --> 23:10.888
You'll be witnesses.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.623
(knocking)

23:27.873 --> 23:30.574
Hmm.

23:36.548 --> 23:39.817
I don't want
to do this to you.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.552
Then don't.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.658
We've come
for the baby, old woman.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.828
Where is it?

23:50.830 --> 23:52.596
I don't understand.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.665
Who are you?

23:59.838 --> 24:00.838
What's in there?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.807
Sacks of grain
and apples

24:02.809 --> 24:04.508
To store
through the winter.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.612
Open it.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.481
Agnes:
My son has the key.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.515
He's not here.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.684
There were two horses outside.

24:13.686 --> 24:16.787
Yes, my son and daughter-in-law
are in from town.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.156
They're visiting the farm
on the next hill.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.567
What's that, then?

24:39.544 --> 24:42.546
I guess you were
telling the truth after all.

24:42.548 --> 24:45.249
(baby crying)

24:51.490 --> 24:52.890
Go.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.627
(baby crying)

24:59.064 --> 25:01.732
(metallic clink)

25:06.972 --> 25:09.807
(door creaks open)

25:09.809 --> 25:11.609
(door closes)

25:13.512 --> 25:15.646
Tomorrow's witnesses
have been canceled.

25:15.648 --> 25:16.981
The inquiry is postponed.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.550
(sighs)
it seems

25:19.552 --> 25:21.785
Henry's had misgivings.

25:21.787 --> 25:24.054
He needs time
to think.

25:26.758 --> 25:28.659
Thank god.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.829
(sighs)

25:35.600 --> 25:38.636
It may be only in a
temporary reprieve,

25:38.638 --> 25:40.571
But at least I've
achieved that.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.673
At the price
of convincing the devil

25:42.675 --> 25:44.074
You're married to
that you love him.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.644
I do love him, richard.

25:46.646 --> 25:49.079
I had to speak
the truth.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.683
There are times when lies...

25:52.685 --> 25:55.986
Lack sufficient power.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.256
Richard, no man has

25:59.258 --> 26:01.158
Ever cared for me
the way you do.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.927
(sighs)

26:02.929 --> 26:05.229
You left court
to throw off suspicion,

26:05.231 --> 26:07.565
And now you've returned...

26:07.567 --> 26:10.167
To take up a task you despise,

26:10.169 --> 26:12.736
And all to protect me.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.638
And for myself.

26:14.640 --> 26:18.742
I dared not let henry appoint
someone else to prosecute you.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.644
Who knows what
they might have found?

26:20.646 --> 26:23.581
Don't pretend
to be self-interested, my dear.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.616
You never could pull it off.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.585
Catherine,

26:27.587 --> 26:30.721
All these years
without you,

26:30.723 --> 26:33.290
Imagining you in henry's arms.

26:33.292 --> 26:36.694
Can't you lie,

26:36.696 --> 26:38.195
And say you love me best?

26:38.197 --> 26:41.131
I will always love you best,

26:41.133 --> 26:44.034
Richard, my heart.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.871
You're the one man
I have never lied to.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.140
Unless this is a lie.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.709
(laughter)

26:53.812 --> 26:57.081
For years, catherine was
unable to get pregnant.

26:57.083 --> 27:01.318
She felt rejected
by the king, humiliated

27:01.320 --> 27:03.187
And frightened,
I'm sure.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.289
A queen who can't
produce an heir?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.659
So, she turned for comfort

27:08.661 --> 27:09.860
To someone else.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.629
Who?

27:11.631 --> 27:13.631
I never saw his face.

27:13.633 --> 27:17.301
But the notes, the secret
letters that flew back and forth

27:17.303 --> 27:19.737
As the time came
for her to give birth.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.805
The orders
to her ladies-in-waiting,

27:21.807 --> 27:23.774
The fear
the king might find out.

27:23.776 --> 27:27.978
She slapped one of the ladies,
told her to be more careful.

27:29.681 --> 27:33.150
Servants are invisible
to the highborn.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.320
They think we aren't even there.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.222
But we are.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.090
I saw

27:40.092 --> 27:42.726
How scared catherine was.

27:42.728 --> 27:46.096
Because it was
the lover's child, you see.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.932
Not henry's.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.079
And you'll testify
to this?
I will.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.815
Mind you, I'm not one
to wish my lady harm.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.785
If she hadn't done such
wickedness to my daughter...

28:07.787 --> 28:09.820
Yes.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.855
We all must protect
those that we love.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.424
Henry:
Have you no evidence
beyond notes

28:13.426 --> 28:16.427
You say were exchanged,
notes you never read?

28:16.429 --> 28:18.829
I thought you wanted
to convict the queen.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.098
I just want to be sure
of the truth.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.166
Well, that's new.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.936
Why should you think
the child wasn't mine?

28:25.938 --> 28:27.705
What color were its eyes?

28:27.707 --> 28:30.140
Agnes:
I can't say.
Richard: My lord,

28:30.142 --> 28:32.710
I'm afraid the witness
doesn't seem that helpful.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.845
I could take her
and question her further.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.480
I barely noticed the eyes,

28:36.482 --> 28:39.283
For the birthmark
over half her cheek.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.452
Birthmark?
The child was born

28:41.454 --> 28:43.854
With a port-wine stain
just above her lip.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.990
The queen reacted
unfavorably to it.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.827
The girl was handed off
to nostradamus's father,

28:49.829 --> 28:53.363
The court surgeon, and must have
died soon after, poor thing.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.891
(baby cooing)

29:28.333 --> 29:30.934
It's not here.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.770
The pagan mark isn't here.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.438
What baby did you take?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.874
This is the same child.
She was with the midwife.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.777
She's useless to me! Useless!

29:39.779 --> 29:41.812
What do you want
me to do with her?

29:41.814 --> 29:43.413
What do I care?

29:43.415 --> 29:44.982
Send her to a convent.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.917
(knocking)

29:48.853 --> 29:50.954
The king wishes
to see you.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.157
(baby cooing)

29:53.159 --> 29:55.025
(grunts)
henry:
Richard,

29:55.027 --> 29:56.794
My old companion.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.862
How many taverns
did we shut down

29:58.864 --> 30:00.330
When we were younger?

30:02.967 --> 30:04.968
I remember how that birthmark
runs in your family.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.805
You were the first of my friends
to grow a beard, weren't you?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.406
You're going to kill me,
aren't you?

30:10.975 --> 30:12.476
What do you want me to say?

30:12.478 --> 30:13.544
That you're sorry!

30:15.280 --> 30:17.581
You were my friend,
and she was my wife.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.920
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.154
Henry:
A short good-bye, I know.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.823
If you need more
time together,

30:25.825 --> 30:27.291
I can have his head delivered
to your chambers

30:27.293 --> 30:29.827
Within the hour.

30:29.829 --> 30:32.129
Always generous
in victory.
It is victory.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.931
There is enough for
the ecclesiastical

30:33.933 --> 30:35.499
Court to render
a guilty verdict.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.534
And then you can have your way
unobstructed.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.937
And put the son of your choice
on the throne.

30:40.872 --> 30:43.473
Pagan sympathizer though he is.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.308
What?

30:44.310 --> 30:45.876
Oh, I could be wrong.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.311
He might not be
a pagan sympathizer.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.880
He might simply be a pagan,
like his mother.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.850
How dare you make these wild,
baseless accusations?

30:52.852 --> 30:53.951
You have no proof!

30:55.053 --> 30:57.421
I'm sure this is
familiar, henry.

30:57.423 --> 31:00.324
Diane kept it
in her chambers.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.126
Oh, it's just a charming,
decorative sculpture.

31:03.128 --> 31:06.063
If you had ever
cared to read

31:06.065 --> 31:08.932
Nostradamus's books
on pagan lore, you would know

31:08.934 --> 31:11.134
That this represents
the soul of its owner.

31:11.136 --> 31:14.238
It's meant to be kept
in the lover's home,

31:14.240 --> 31:17.407
So the lover's soul can be kept
close to one's own.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.376
It's very pretty, if heretical.

31:22.947 --> 31:24.047
Huh.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.987
Diane's soul.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.623
Lovely, if a bit lightweight.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.258
(scoffs)
bash:
Father,

31:34.260 --> 31:34.992
Let me speak.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.426
Silence.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.961
You'll have your turn.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.030
Catherine
let's face it, henry. What good

31:40.032 --> 31:41.932
Is a catholic claim to England

31:41.934 --> 31:44.334
When heresy abounds
here in France?

31:44.336 --> 31:47.037
The rumors alone
could splinter your realm

31:47.039 --> 31:48.939
And destroy your entire legacy.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.974
Father, she's lying!
She planted the evidence.

31:50.976 --> 31:53.176
Silence!

31:53.178 --> 31:56.680
I've been betrayed
sufficiently for one day.

31:56.682 --> 31:57.547
Go on.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.316
Yes.

31:59.318 --> 32:03.020
I can see how you might suspect
I had planted the evidence.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.188
But as it happens, you've had
two guards accompanying me

32:05.190 --> 32:06.924
Wherever I go. (laughs)

32:06.926 --> 32:10.027
How ironic
that they are now my witnesses.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.364
Bellows?

32:16.634 --> 32:18.201
Is it true?

32:18.203 --> 32:20.370
Did you see the queen
find this object?

32:20.372 --> 32:23.040
Yes, my lord.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.075
She told us to come in and
witness that everything

32:25.077 --> 32:27.477
Was above board.
That thing was

32:27.479 --> 32:29.012
In a chest on the table.

32:29.014 --> 32:30.380
Queen catherine
didn't plant it there.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.483
Would you be willing to testify
to this publicly?

32:35.420 --> 32:38.422
I will speak the truth,
my lord.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.723
Ah.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.458
(catherine chuckles)

32:43.628 --> 32:44.728
(yells)

32:44.730 --> 32:47.297
(catherine screaming)

32:55.506 --> 32:58.508
And you?

32:58.510 --> 32:59.977
Did you see anything?

32:59.979 --> 33:01.745
No, my lord,
I saw nothing.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.086
You don't need to teach me
how rumors work.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.989
I know it, and I know
the time to quash them

33:11.991 --> 33:13.523
Is when they're still
in the seed.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.759
You're letting your lust
for England blind you!

33:15.761 --> 33:17.728
I've had a lot of time
to think about that,

33:17.730 --> 33:18.996
Well before England became
a possibility.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.998
As it happens,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.400
Diane chose to share
her secret with me.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.268
It took some years
for her to trust me.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.570
I'm glad she did.

33:26.572 --> 33:30.140
She wanted to put
her past behind her,

33:30.142 --> 33:31.241
To have a new life with me.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.542
I'd hoped once

33:32.544 --> 33:34.411
The same might be
true with you,

33:34.413 --> 33:37.381
That you could put your family
behind you and we'd grow closer,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.750
But every year

33:39.752 --> 33:43.086
Shows me how deep
your medici blood goes.

33:43.088 --> 33:45.422
You wouldn't have minded
my medici blood

33:45.424 --> 33:49.159
If the hurt of my betrayal
wasn't stinging you right now.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.528
I know
how that feels.

33:51.530 --> 33:54.097
Well played.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.169
(sighs)

34:05.343 --> 34:09.146
Lesson for the day:
Next time you see a threat,

34:09.148 --> 34:12.182
Large or small,
you cut it down like a weed.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.316
Understand?

34:13.318 --> 34:16.153
Yes.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.587
(sword clangs)

34:25.830 --> 34:27.130
(door opens)

34:31.202 --> 34:33.303
You've disgraced
yourself

34:33.305 --> 34:35.105
And our family.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.207
By what, adultery?

34:37.209 --> 34:39.810
How many of our family
have taken lovers?

34:39.812 --> 34:41.211
Including the popes.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.146
You've disgraced
us by losing.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.347
(sighs)

34:44.349 --> 34:46.416
Yes.

34:48.186 --> 34:49.319
I can attempt escape.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.088
With our money,
I can fashion a bribe

34:51.090 --> 34:52.089
Like no other.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.857
You can give me refuge in Italy.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.425
We can give
you this.

34:57.695 --> 35:01.098
I saw the way you looked
at the execution block.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.233
This is kinder
than the ax.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.735
And less vulgar
in the eyes of the family.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.538
Safe voyage,
queen catherine.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.847
(door closes)

35:19.851 --> 35:23.320
Queen catherine is just
the first, isn't she?

35:23.322 --> 35:26.423
I suppose my cousin elizabeth
is on that list, too.

35:26.425 --> 35:30.160
That's the deal I made
with the king.

35:30.162 --> 35:33.130
Mary, claiming England
means nothing to me.

35:33.132 --> 35:36.166
I was only interested
in claiming you.

35:36.168 --> 35:38.201
If you want
to change your mind...

35:38.203 --> 35:40.670
Henry will never permit it.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.173
The decision is yours.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.775
And if henry stands in the way,

35:45.777 --> 35:47.811
I'll kill him for you.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.380
Did you hear
his advice today?

35:50.382 --> 35:52.282
To cut down any threat?

35:52.284 --> 35:54.618
He put my head
on the chopping block

35:54.620 --> 35:56.153
To threaten you.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.687
Anyone who threatens you

35:57.689 --> 36:00.824
Or terrorizes you or harms you,

36:00.826 --> 36:03.693
I will cut down.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.362
Even my father.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.732
You're always saying
that you're not francis.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.600
I can see that now.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.402
Yes.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.205
My brother is more civilized.

36:15.207 --> 36:18.275
He plays by the rules.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.277
Bash?

36:21.879 --> 36:23.580
Yes.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.416
You frighten me sometimes.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.486
And exhilarate me, and
challenge me to do things

36:29.488 --> 36:31.188
I never thought I could.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.790
You don't have to be francis.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.393
You're sure?

36:36.395 --> 36:38.528
Because there'll be
no turning back.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.432
You asked me if things might
have been different

36:42.434 --> 36:43.900
If I had come to you

36:43.902 --> 36:46.403
With an open heart.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.405
♪ around again to when

36:48.407 --> 36:50.707
♪ to when

36:54.779 --> 36:57.847
My heart is open.

36:57.849 --> 37:02.586
♪ running out
the spaces of mind ♪

37:09.560 --> 37:12.495

38:44.055 --> 38:45.689
Oh, don't overreact.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.657
The guards are outside the door
if you want to shout.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.993
Meanwhile, there's
no one to see you

38:49.995 --> 38:52.429
In your altogether except me.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.597
How are you allowed
to wander around the castle?

38:54.599 --> 38:56.733
Well, I told them I was
preparing an appeal

38:56.735 --> 38:59.035
To be lodged with the
ecclesiastical court.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.439
Of course, we all know how
pointless that would be.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.477
Don't call out.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.845
This is madness.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.613
A few days ago,
I'd have thought so.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.415
Now I have no alternative.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.750
We both must die.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.385
You've already lost.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.454
You have nothing to gain
from killing me.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.456
I'm a mother.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.523
And a mother

39:20.525 --> 39:21.658
Who won't be here to be sure

39:21.660 --> 39:23.526
That her children are safe.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.495
But I can give them one thing.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.430
I can remove you before I go.

39:27.432 --> 39:30.500
I mean your children no harm.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.535
What do your good
intentions matter?

39:32.537 --> 39:35.705
I kill you, and the marriage
with sebastian is gone.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.142
My children's
inheritance restored.

39:39.144 --> 39:42.379
I kill you, and ensure
that you can never be

39:42.381 --> 39:44.714
The cause of francis's death.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.383
(coughs)

39:46.385 --> 39:49.986
It's the best legacy
that I can offer.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.622
(gasping for air)

39:54.525 --> 39:57.727
I hope you'll excuse
the choice of poison.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.430
I know death takes
a bit longer.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.866
But I didn't want
to be cruel.

40:02.868 --> 40:06.636
I promise that
you'll feel no pain.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.473
(door opens)

40:21.152 --> 40:22.685
(knocking)
man: Who goes there?

40:22.687 --> 40:25.822
Your grace?!

40:25.824 --> 40:28.992
(coughing)
(man shouting)

40:28.994 --> 40:31.528
Wake up, mother!
(knocking)

40:31.530 --> 40:33.062
Wake up, mother!

40:33.064 --> 40:34.464
Man:
Open the door now!

40:34.466 --> 40:36.166
Wake up, mother!

40:36.168 --> 40:38.568
Wake up, mother.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.004
No.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.541
They told me
you were dead.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.643
Man: Open the door!
You should be dead.

40:47.845 --> 40:50.613
(coughing)
and so should I.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.514
But I'm saving you.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.185
Get away from me! Go!

40:55.187 --> 40:56.186
Get out!

40:56.188 --> 40:57.787
(wheezing)

40:57.789 --> 40:59.856
(coughing)
(grunts)

40:59.858 --> 41:02.892
Don't touch them.
They might be poisoned.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.594
Mary.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.162
(panting)

41:07.565 --> 41:10.600
Mary. Are you all right?
What happened?

41:12.770 --> 41:14.103
(coughing)

41:16.106 --> 41:20.043
Catherine tried
to kill me.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.644
Take her away.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.079
Chain her up

41:23.081 --> 41:24.781
Like the animal she is!

41:25.883 --> 41:26.950
(coughing, panting)

41:30.921 --> 41:33.223
You should have left France
while you had the chance!

41:33.225 --> 41:34.791
He's a man with secrets.

41:34.793 --> 41:37.160
You've made a choice
that will be your ruin!

41:37.162 --> 41:39.095
I know who he is.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.997
And I've made
the perfect choice.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.566
Because together,
we have killed you.
