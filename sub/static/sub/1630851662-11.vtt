00:24.524 --> 00:26.443
<i>Unlike the Chaos Lords,</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:30.321
<i>the Lords of Order
rarely descended to Earth...</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:32.449
<i>Instead, they would empower</i>

00:32.532 --> 00:35.618
<i>a human being
to act as their agent.</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.455
<i>The theory was that
a mortal's earthly ties</i>

00:38.538 --> 00:40.415
<i>would allow for
a greater understanding</i>

00:40.498 --> 00:44.169
<i>of the problems that
Chaos created among humankind.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:50.633
<i>Though perhaps,
in truth, the Lords of Order</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:56.139
<i>simply hesitated
to dirty their hands
on our chaotic world.</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:58.475
<i>Arion was the first such agent</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:02.479
<i>empowered by and for
the Lords of Order on Earth.</i>

01:05.231 --> 01:07.567
<i>But Chaos's partnership
with a mortal,</i>

01:07.650 --> 01:10.236
<i>not to mention
their sinking of Atlantis,</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:14.157
<i>represented a significant
escalation of the conflict.</i>

01:19.078 --> 01:24.209
<i>And Arion's resulting death,
forced Order to reassess.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:31.966
<i>Thus, they took a moment
to observe the architect
of all this chaos.</i>

01:33.510 --> 01:34.886
<i>Varl'jat...</i>

01:36.095 --> 01:39.682
<i>Soon to be known as Marduk.</i>

02:23.059 --> 02:26.646
We. Are. So. Moded.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.731
Fixing this would take
a lot more than

02:28.815 --> 02:30.191
bending a branch
back into shape.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.987
<i>Teg aremac ydaer!</i>

02:35.905 --> 02:37.574
You know who I'm going to see.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.243
So you and Blood should go
on a recruiting tour, too.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.036
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.632
<i>Rehtaf, ediug ruo
yenruoj hguorht
S'etaf Yloh Hkna!</i>

03:00.096 --> 03:01.931
Thanks, Doc.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.600
I'm not a doctor yet.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.602
Nope. Not yet.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.395
Is she all right?

03:07.478 --> 03:09.647
There's a cost
to magic.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.650
She's drained her <i>vim vitae,</i>
her life force.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.111
Using the ankh
always takes it out of me.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.779
Huh?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.782
That spell usually takes me
to the stairs.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.784
<i>I wonder why we wound up here?</i>

03:21.868 --> 03:23.953
- Aunt Inza?
- Oh, that's why.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.663
And where is here, exactly?

03:29.292 --> 03:30.627
- Whoa!

03:30.710 --> 03:31.878
Nice entrance.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.630
Daughter of Zatara,

03:33.713 --> 03:37.634
you invoke our ankh
and invade our tower.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.304
Take these children
and get out.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.193
Yes! Mission time.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.987
- Beast Boy?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.989
- Garfield?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.866
Huh? What?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.242
The mission.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.786
Did you seriously not hear
the Troub-Alert?

04:04.869 --> 04:07.664
Sure. Yeah, yeah, of course.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.333
So, are you coming or what?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.293
Nah. You got this covered.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.879
"You got this covered"?

04:16.047 --> 04:17.632
Is that our catchphrase now?

04:21.594 --> 04:27.225
<i>7,586 years
after the fall of Atlantis,</i>

04:27.308 --> 04:29.894
<i>came the rise of Babylonia.</i>

04:29.978 --> 04:34.649
<i>But ruling this new kingdom
came with its own challenges.</i>

04:34.732 --> 04:36.567
<i>Marduk found himself frustrated</i>

04:36.651 --> 04:38.528
<i>with his Babylonian generals</i>

04:38.611 --> 04:41.614
<i>and their
pernicious independence
of mind.</i>

04:41.698 --> 04:43.366
Guess who?

04:43.449 --> 04:47.537
<i>The Chaos Lord Klarion
arrived, without invitation,</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:49.414
<i>but with an offer of help.</i>

04:49.497 --> 04:52.375
<i>Marduk's son, Nabu,
argued fiercely</i>

04:52.458 --> 04:55.753
<i>against giving the Witch Boy
free rein.</i>

04:55.837 --> 04:58.548
<i>But Marduk,
ignoring his son's advice,</i>

04:58.631 --> 05:01.509
<i>was intrigued
by Klarion's offer.</i>

05:01.592 --> 05:03.219
<i>The result...</i>

05:03.302 --> 05:06.931
<i>Klarion brought
a Starro-Creature
from Deep Space</i>

05:07.807 --> 05:09.642
<i>to Ancient Babylon.</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:17.900
I can't leave. A new Chaos Lord
threatens the Earth.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.070
Yes. She calls herself Child.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.282
Do not waste time telling Fate
what's already known.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.784
Then Fate knows
we need his help.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.454
We are not
inclined to intervene.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.456
I know exactly what
you're thinking.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.832
We doubt that.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.752
I do, because I had
the exact same thought.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.921
Two Chaos Lords
at each other's throats
sounded like a win.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.008
Right up until their conflict
sank half of Roanoke Island.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.385
We can't wait
for the final outcome.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.637
We have to stop
the fight itself.

05:46.721 --> 05:50.433
And you plan on doing that
with these children?

05:50.516 --> 05:52.810
Yes, while you confront
Child and Klarion,

05:52.894 --> 05:55.605
my Sentinels can
covertly strike
from the shadows.

05:55.688 --> 05:59.525
Your "Sentinels" are not ready
for this fight.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.486
- We so are.
- We've been training
really hard.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.738
- We're ready for anything...
more or less.
- Kind of.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.784
They'll do great,
Nabu. You just watch.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.744
Let us test that premise.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.668
Observe.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.964
Ugh! Great.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.300
Now, I guess I'm supposed
to prove myself.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.517
You don't have to
prove anything to me, Trace!

06:32.600 --> 06:33.726
Who are you?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.812
- I'm your boyfriend.
- You're a puppet.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.107
- I'm your puppet boyfriend.
- And I'm your puppet mentor.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.983
And I'm
your puppet idol.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.529
Terrific.
Who's controlling you?
Why are you here?

06:44.612 --> 06:46.739
We're here
to cheer you up.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.366
I don't need cheering up.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.159
Of course, you don't.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.829
<i>What would be the point, loser?</i>

06:52.912 --> 06:54.956
- Who was that?
- Ignore the whispers.

06:55.039 --> 06:59.335
- They're nothing.
<i>Nothing, like you.</i>

07:02.004 --> 07:03.214
Noted.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.508
A mystic test
to draw out my insecurities.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.678
What do you have to be
insecure about?
You're terrific!

07:08.761 --> 07:10.680
All your friends think
you're great.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.307
<i>They just
don't trust you
to have their backs.</i>

07:13.391 --> 07:15.560
You've got
the coolest powers, too!

07:15.643 --> 07:17.436
<i>Too bad
you still haven't
mastered them.</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:19.605
That's why I invited you
to join the Outsiders!

07:19.689 --> 07:22.191
<i>That's why
he was relieved when
you turned him down.</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:24.360
That's why I wanted you
as my protegee!

07:24.443 --> 07:27.947
<i>That's why
she pulled in Khalid and Mary
to replace you.</i>

07:28.030 --> 07:30.366
Stop it! It's not gonna work.

07:30.449 --> 07:32.285
Come out here and face me.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.079
Is it Fate?
Is Nabu pulling your strings?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.414
We're hand puppets.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.040
We have no strings.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.501
Besides, there's no one
back there.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.379
<i>You're afraid
to face the ugly truth.</i>

07:43.462 --> 07:46.007
I'm not afraid to face
ugly you!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.095
What the hell?

07:51.179 --> 07:53.848
Funny you should mention hell.

07:53.931 --> 07:56.058
<i>Here's your ugly truth, Traci.</i>

07:56.142 --> 07:58.811
<i>You're a fraud.
You don't belong here.</i>

07:58.895 --> 08:00.980
You're not ready
for this fight.

08:05.151 --> 08:09.530
<i>Marduk was not prepared
for the gifts Starro brought.</i>

08:10.823 --> 08:12.658
<i>Instantly, it became clear</i>

08:12.742 --> 08:16.871
<i>Starro was no solution
to Marduk's problems,</i>

08:16.954 --> 08:19.582
<i>as the alien creature
put the Babylonian army</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:23.002
<i>under its own control,
not Marduk's.</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:26.589
<i>As for Marduk's son Nabu,</i>

08:26.672 --> 08:29.550
<i>it was his fate to die,</i>

08:29.634 --> 08:33.679
<i>fighting the enemy
his father had
unintentionally raised.</i>

08:33.763 --> 08:37.683
<i>And his death,
under these circumstances,</i>

08:37.767 --> 08:41.395
<i>left the Lords of Order
intrigued.</i>

08:53.115 --> 08:54.575
Where am I?

08:56.911 --> 08:58.579
- What in the...
- What are you doing?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.790
You should be making
hospital rounds,
diagnosing people,

09:00.873 --> 09:01.791
helping them.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.292
I am helping people.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.586
I'm trying to become a doctor
and a hero.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.964
It's the same thing,
just different methods.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.132
Your methods are magic.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.301
I thought
you were Muslim.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.138
Mom, I... I am Muslim.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.057
You're not behaving
like one, Khalid.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.017
You should rely on God alone.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.562
I gave up magic
when I converted to Islam.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.398
Look, magic is a tool
I'm using to do good.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.899
I mean, that's what
our faith is all about.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.401
If you were a good Muslim,

09:28.484 --> 09:30.111
you would listen
to your mother.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.904
That's... that's not fair.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.824
You're using religion
to bully me into doing
what you want.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.452
What I want is a better life
for you. A safer life.

09:38.536 --> 09:42.123
He's
following in the footsteps
of your uncle, Jane.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.416
He's Homo Magi.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.793
He has to honor
his genetic heritage,

09:45.876 --> 09:49.505
even if it means giving up
the study of medicine.

09:49.588 --> 09:52.216
Dad, I'm not
giving up medicine.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.052
I can do both,
forge my own identity.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.513
We don't get to choose
our destinies.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.682
You have a responsibility.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.517
And this is responsible?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.602
He can't play
at being a hero, Muhammed.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.355
I'm not playing.
I'm training, studying.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.650
Time taken away from training
and studying to be a doctor.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.027
I know, but...

10:11.110 --> 10:14.030
Your father and I didn't
work hard our whole lives

10:14.113 --> 10:15.698
to put you through
medical school...

10:15.781 --> 10:16.741
I know, but...

10:16.824 --> 10:18.034
only to have you run off.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.077
You cannot abandon
your true calling.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.454
I know, but...

10:21.537 --> 10:24.040
Admit the truth.
We are drowning in your doubts.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.418
You're killing us both,
because you're not ready
for this fight.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.270
We run an entire mission
against the Headmaster,

10:46.354 --> 10:48.856
and he hasn't moved an inch?

10:48.939 --> 10:51.901
Hey, Beast Boss!
Have you been sleeping
this whole time?

10:51.984 --> 10:55.237
What? No. I'm awake.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.322
Kinda not!

10:57.656 --> 10:58.908
So what?

10:58.991 --> 11:01.077
First, you guys say
I don't get enough sleep.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.661
Now, too much?

11:02.745 --> 11:04.497
There's just no pleasing you.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.762
It is on, Nabu.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.723
Say it. I want you to say it.

11:24.642 --> 11:29.814
- No. We don't say
that anymore. We can't.
<i>-Help!</i>

11:29.897 --> 11:32.358
- Say it and save me.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.985
Speed of Mercury!

11:36.654 --> 11:38.280
Not that way.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.786
<i>-Help me! Save me!</i>

11:43.869 --> 11:45.287
Say it, please!

11:45.371 --> 11:47.498
Strength of Hercules!

11:47.581 --> 11:50.626
- That's not the way.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.044
You're not doing it right.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.630
I know, but I can't.
I promised.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.424
If you won't say it, I will.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.925
- Don't...
- Shazam!

12:03.639 --> 12:05.266
You don't have what it takes.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.309
Stamina of Atlas!

12:08.978 --> 12:10.563
- What are you doing?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.690
You're not a hero.
You're not a sorceress.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.150
Courage of Achille...

12:14.233 --> 12:16.444
- You call that power?

12:16.527 --> 12:18.863
This is what
real power looks like.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.698
Stop dabbling in half-measures!

12:23.534 --> 12:25.411
You're pathetic.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.121
Afraid to be your true self,

12:27.204 --> 12:30.082
and without enough imagination
to become something new.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.335
Without me, you're not ready
for this fight.

12:45.222 --> 12:49.393
<i>The Babylonians
had believed Nabu to be
a God of Wisdom.</i>

12:49.477 --> 12:54.148
<i>He was already, in his own way,
a Champion of Order,</i>

12:54.231 --> 12:57.234
<i>willing to defy his father,
Marduk,</i>

12:57.318 --> 13:01.989
<i>Chaos' immortal mortal ally
upon the Earth.</i>

13:02.072 --> 13:05.367
<i>What better candidate
for Order's purpose?</i>

13:05.451 --> 13:09.163
<i>So the Lords of Order
recruited Nabu's soul,</i>

13:09.246 --> 13:13.792
<i>now free of the limitations
of his fragile mortal form.</i>

13:13.876 --> 13:16.212
<i>Elevating it
to a higher calling,</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:20.674
<i>they gave purpose
to his once pointless death,</i>

13:20.758 --> 13:24.136
<i>and revealed the dangers
resulting from the Chaos</i>

13:24.220 --> 13:27.640
<i>of the Klarion-Marduk alliance.</i>

13:27.723 --> 13:30.976
<i>Gaining an oath
of Nabu's fealty to Order,</i>

13:31.060 --> 13:34.813
<i>the Lords forged
something new.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:38.108
<i>Not simply an agent of Order
on Earth,</i>

13:38.192 --> 13:40.152
<i>but a Lord of Order,</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:43.572
<i>created from the soul
of mortal man</i>

13:43.656 --> 13:45.491
<i>and Nabu's own helmet.</i>

13:45.574 --> 13:47.535
<i>The Helmet of Fate</i>

13:47.618 --> 13:50.287
<i>would act as the anchor
for his spirit</i>

13:50.371 --> 13:52.915
<i>on the mortal plane.</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:56.210
<i>The only thing required
was a human host body,</i>

13:56.293 --> 13:59.421
<i>capable of channeling
Nabu's mystic power.</i>

14:01.423 --> 14:05.761
<i>Such hosts were
not always easy to come by.</i>

14:08.764 --> 14:12.226
<i>Yet, Nabu became
the Lord of Order,</i>

14:12.309 --> 14:15.062
<i>known as Doctor Fate,</i>

14:15.145 --> 14:17.314
<i>who has for centuries</i>

14:18.440 --> 14:21.485
<i>defended this world from Chaos.</i>

14:24.446 --> 14:27.533
<i>Bad luck magic.</i>

14:27.616 --> 14:30.494
You're as likely to
curse friends as enemies.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.165
Urban magic.
What does that even mean?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.418
<i>And what if the battle isn't
in a city?</i>

14:39.378 --> 14:42.506
You're just a kid
playing out of your depth.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.717
<i>You are not ready.</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:55.019
Thanks, Leroy. You're right.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.939
The thing is,

14:59.023 --> 15:01.108
I live with these voices.

15:01.191 --> 15:05.487
I work through my insecurities
every day,

15:05.571 --> 15:07.406
but I am not a quitter.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.783
I didn't have to join
the Outsiders.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.619
<i>I'm already on the Team.</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:17.666
Yes, I'm afraid,
but I get up anyway,

15:17.750 --> 15:20.794
<i>and I'm brave enough
to ask for help.</i>

15:20.878 --> 15:25.299
I work, I train,
I make myself better.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.636
And I don't fear failure,
or let it stop me.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.014
Well, not for long anyway.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.486
I am ready.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.623
<i>-As-Salaam-u 'A-lay'kum.
- Wa-Alay'kum-us-Salam.</i>

16:45.671 --> 16:49.383
I am a man of faith, science
and mysticism.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.678
A Muslim and Homo Magi.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.098
I am
a first-generation American
on my father's side

16:56.181 --> 17:00.269
and descended from
Mayflower pilgrims
on my mother's.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.271
I will forge a new way forward

17:02.354 --> 17:05.441
on a path
built by those before me.

17:05.524 --> 17:11.113
I can and will be
both a doctor and a sorcerer.

17:11.196 --> 17:15.325
That is my jihad,
my inner struggle.

17:15.409 --> 17:19.121
In my world, magic is
a science of its own.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.498
Another tool from our creator,

17:21.582 --> 17:24.126
to serve what's good.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.629
My faith will strengthen
and guide me

17:27.713 --> 17:29.798
as I walk along this path.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.057
I am ready.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.147
- Look at me.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.317
I'm beautiful, I am powerful.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.613
I am better and stronger
than anyone and anything!

17:52.696 --> 17:55.365
Why wouldn't you want this?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.701
- No. Not you.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.370
Forgot why you gave it up, huh?

18:00.454 --> 18:03.123
Forgot how
you traded everything
for the power?

18:03.207 --> 18:07.544
Being Sergeant full-time
and not living your life
as Mary at all?

18:09.254 --> 18:13.008
When Freddy and I came to you,
you agreed it wasn't right.

18:13.091 --> 18:17.387
<i>Back then, you knew
you had to stop using
the power completely.</i>

18:17.471 --> 18:18.972
Quit it. Quit her.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.100
Cold turkey. Or else you'd
never give her up.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.645
No. No.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.272
No, you need me.
You are nothing without me.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.692
Billy was right.
I had to stop.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.570
But that doesn't mean
I have to stop being a hero.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.573
I can use my connection to you
to become a sorceress.

18:36.657 --> 18:40.911
To be just as important
and powerful as you ever were,

18:40.994 --> 18:44.706
without abandoning who I am.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.292
No!

18:51.964 --> 18:54.216
Go get 'em, sis!

18:54.299 --> 18:56.343
I am ready for this fight.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.268
Ha! See? There's a reason why
I chose each one of them.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.103
They can handle what's coming.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.938
Is this true?

19:08.021 --> 19:10.190
Are you ready to enter a battle

19:10.274 --> 19:13.443
which could
easily cost you your lives?

19:13.527 --> 19:14.945
- I am.
- Ready.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.780
Been there, done that.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.782
Perhaps they are ready.

19:18.866 --> 19:24.079
Still, Fate has neither need
nor use for them, or you,

19:24.163 --> 19:27.124
as we have no intention
of intervening

19:27.207 --> 19:30.544
so long as Chaos fights Chaos.

19:51.940 --> 19:56.361
<i>And thus,
a single champion was
raised by Order</i>

19:56.445 --> 20:00.073
<i>to battle Chaos
in all its forms.</i>

20:00.157 --> 20:03.911
Nabu, why do you tell me
what I already know?

20:03.994 --> 20:05.454
So that you may understand

20:05.537 --> 20:08.957
why there is, as yet, no need
for us to act.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.627
<i>Let the Chaos Lords fight,</i>

20:11.710 --> 20:14.796
<i>until even the victor
has been weakened by battle.</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:18.842
Fate will step forward
to bring order in the end,

20:18.926 --> 20:22.429
as we have done for millennia.

20:22.512 --> 20:26.683
Nabu, how can you miss
the point of your own story?

20:26.767 --> 20:29.394
You view Fate
as a single champion,

20:29.478 --> 20:33.982
a lone warrior, capable of
triumphing over any opposition.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.817
But this has never been true,

20:35.901 --> 20:38.445
nor was it
your masters' intent.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.740
The Lords of Order planned
for Doctor Fate's formation

20:41.823 --> 20:44.201
to require two champions,

20:44.284 --> 20:47.329
Nabu and Fate's host.

20:47.412 --> 20:49.331
Both are equally important.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.960
For if the host fails,
so falls Fate.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.003
<i>And for Fate to succeed,</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:58.548
<i>Nabu must draw on
his host's diverse strengths.</i>

20:58.632 --> 21:01.051
Yet every host, every person,

21:01.134 --> 21:03.553
finds their strength
in their own way.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.932
Look at these three children,
whom you tested this day,

21:07.015 --> 21:12.187
<i>finding strength
through mentors, family
and faith.</i>

21:12.270 --> 21:17.192
Honestly, do you think
I would have survived
these ten years

21:17.275 --> 21:22.114
as your host and prisoner,
without my faith
in a higher power?

21:25.617 --> 21:28.745
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

21:28.829 --> 21:30.831
hallowed be thy name.

21:30.914 --> 21:34.459
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done,

21:34.543 --> 21:37.295
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.215
Give us this day
our daily bread

21:40.298 --> 21:42.718
<i>and forgive us our trespasses,</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:46.221
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

21:46.304 --> 21:49.057
And lead us
not into temptation,

21:49.141 --> 21:50.934
but deliver us from evil.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.186
Amen.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.732
And the victories
you so proudly cite,

21:56.815 --> 21:59.860
would they have come
without allies
such as the League,

21:59.943 --> 22:02.738
or the Lords of Order
themselves?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.365
You view cooperation as Chaos.

22:05.449 --> 22:09.745
<i>But it is
only in the combined strengths
of all these individuals,</i>

22:09.828 --> 22:11.997
<i>in the unity of the disparate,</i>

22:12.080 --> 22:15.208
<i>that Order may truly rise
out of Chaos.</i>

22:15.292 --> 22:17.461
<i>You must know this
on some level,</i>

22:17.544 --> 22:20.088
<i>Or why else would you have
allowed Kent Nelson</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:23.383
<i>to push you into joining
the Justice Society,</i>

22:23.467 --> 22:26.970
Or allowed me to keep you
in the Justice League?

22:27.054 --> 22:29.264
Great Nabu, step back

22:29.347 --> 22:31.641
from the precipice
of your own arrogance,

22:31.725 --> 22:35.604
and heed the words of those
who seek only to
aid your cause,

22:35.687 --> 22:37.439
lest you fall victim to Chaos,

22:37.522 --> 22:41.568
as you did in your natural life
so many years ago.

22:41.651 --> 22:45.822
<i>Start by listening
to my daughter.</i>

22:49.034 --> 22:50.786
<i>We need you
in this battle.</i>

22:50.869 --> 22:52.829
What more can I say
to convince you?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.209
Come on, Nabu,

22:57.292 --> 22:59.461
you cranky old fart, let me in!

22:59.544 --> 23:02.506
- I need help.
<i>You're beyond help.</i>

23:05.717 --> 23:08.595
Flaw, please kill his anchor.

23:08.678 --> 23:09.971
Big talk!

23:10.055 --> 23:11.890
- Teekl is my familiar!

23:11.973 --> 23:13.517
She won't be that easy to kill.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.274
Teekl!

23:30.826 --> 23:33.745
Mm, not as hard as
you made it sound.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.583
No!
