Down to florida.

03:02.501 --> 03:03.501
They say you can
go swimming there,

03:03.536 --> 03:04.632
Even in january.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.133
Sure. We can even
hop one to california,

03:06.168 --> 03:08.466
If we wanted to.

break that easy.

those pens.

can't we?

03:34.934 --> 03:36.300
Now, listen. What we
don't take we ain't got.

03:36.335 --> 03:37.365

look around.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.133

to break that lock.

a bad cut on your eye?

05:25.369 --> 05:27.432
Not bad. Just a few
stitches in it.

your eye out or somethin'.

05:29.903 --> 05:31.432

tomorrow?

05:31.467 --> 05:33.534
Listen, rocky, i've been
worrying about this

05:33.569 --> 05:34.998
All last night.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.032
I can't let you take
the whole blame.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.300
Pipe down. You want
that flapper to hear you?

05:39.335 --> 05:41.534
Now get this. You got away,
didn't you? Ok.

05:41.569 --> 05:43.032
Now, why be a sucker?

05:43.067 --> 05:45.534
But, rocky, maybe if they
thought i was in on it,

05:45.569 --> 05:47.132
They'd go easier
on you.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.534
In a pig's eye they would.
Now you listen to me.

05:48.569 --> 05:50.666
Just 'cause you can run
faster than me,

05:50.701 --> 05:53.167
You don't need to go around
and eat yourself.

05:53.202 --> 05:54.667
But it ain't fair
to you, rocky.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.133
Look, so they
send me up. So what?

05:56.168 --> 05:57.432
What have i got to lose?

05:57.467 --> 05:58.834

enough without me.

05:58.869 --> 06:00.365

It's the breaks.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.332
I got caught, and you
got away, that's all.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.968
But you, rocky. Supposin' i
was the one who got caught.

06:05.003 --> 06:06.818
I bet you wouldn't
keep quiet.

06:06.853 --> 06:08.827
You'd make 'em
send you up, too.

06:08.862 --> 06:10.766
Go on. What do you
think i am?

06:10.801 --> 06:11.968
I'd lay dead, just like
you're gonna do.

06:12.003 --> 06:13.065
You would?

06:13.100 --> 06:17.067
Sure. Always remember-
Don't be a sucker.

every string i can.

the right people.

07:28.634 --> 07:30.599
I think i can get you off
with about three years.

07:30.634 --> 07:32.667
You talk like i could do
that three years in a handstand.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.365
That's along time.
That ain't no picnic.

soft on those cushions.

It's a tough break, but
i'm not gonna mark time.

07:39.677 --> 07:42.200
I'll scout around, make
connections for both of us.

07:42.235 --> 07:43.998

take the fall?

07:44.033 --> 07:45.998
There's no other way out.
Now, be sensible.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.616
If they get me, too, i'll
not only be disbarred,

07:48.651 --> 07:51.200
But they'll check my vault
and grab that 100 grand.

07:51.235 --> 07:53.701
You don't want to lose
that dough, do you?

07:53.736 --> 07:55.165
All right, frazier.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.367
It's my rap,
and i'll take it,

07:57.402 --> 07:59.165
But it's my 100 grand,

07:59.200 --> 08:02.200
And i'll take that, too,
the day i get out.

a smart lawyer,

08:04.769 --> 08:06.199

old sacristy, huh?

11:44.652 --> 11:46.601
Remember it? He used to
stand right where you are

11:46.636 --> 11:47.998
And boil the tar
out of me.

11:48.033 --> 11:50.666
Gosh. 15 years.
It doesn't seem possible

11:50.701 --> 11:53.300
I haven't seen you
in that length of time.

11:53.335 --> 11:54.451
I've seen you.

11:54.486 --> 11:55.660
You have? Where?

11:55.695 --> 11:56.799
I was in the stands

90-Yard run against nyu.

11:58.402 --> 12:00.098
Why didn't you
come back and see me?

12:00.133 --> 12:02.200
Couldn't. Some people
were waitin' for me.

12:02.235 --> 12:03.299
Oh.

12:03.334 --> 12:05.317
Well, i got a kick
coming, though.

12:05.352 --> 12:07.326
Why haven't you
written to me?

12:07.361 --> 12:09.265
Aw, you know
how it is, jerry.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.300
I changed my address
and number so often,

12:11.335 --> 12:13.265
You had no way
of answerin' me.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.467
And you know what happens to
letters written in the stir.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.766
Everybody from the p. K.
Down reads 'em.

12:17.801 --> 12:19.467

nothin' happened anyway,

12:19.502 --> 12:20.965
And when i was out,

12:21.000 --> 12:22.467
It was all there to read
on the front page.

wanted you to do it,

12:30.269 --> 12:31.632
But what finally
decided you?

I was riding along
on the top of a bus,

12:34.418 --> 12:36.509
Looking down,
passing the cathedral.

12:36.544 --> 12:38.566

That's funny.

of a bus one time.

a lot of crazy things

13:06.469 --> 13:07.666

13:07.701 --> 13:09.000
Certainly did.

You run along and tell 'em
i'll be right over.

the game started.

What's this
store racket?

You got the kids shillin'
for the parish?

13:26.135 --> 13:28.100
Ha ha! That's not
a bad idea, rocky.

13:28.135 --> 13:30.065
No. It's a pet
scheme of mine-

13:30.100 --> 13:32.100
Sort of a recreation
spot for the kids.

13:32.135 --> 13:33.951
Kind of a kindergarten
place, huh?

13:33.986 --> 13:35.732
No. It's for
the big fellas, too.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.767
You'd be surprised how
tremendously it's helped

13:37.802 --> 13:39.634
To keep the kids
from becoming...

13:39.669 --> 13:41.133
Hoodlums like me?

13:41.168 --> 13:42.265
Ha ha!

13:42.300 --> 13:44.550

a lot of prayer.

13:44.585 --> 13:47.176
I've been to kind of
a retreat myself.

13:47.211 --> 13:49.732
Yes. Will you be
here for some time?

13:49.767 --> 13:51.784

Only i thought
it was next month.

Otherwise,
i would have met you

18:30.868 --> 18:32.450
With the brass band

18:32.485 --> 18:34.509
Yeah, i thought it was

18:34.544 --> 18:36.189
But you've been busy
the last three years.

18:36.224 --> 18:37.834

a swell layout here.

in the dough.

18:39.653 --> 18:41.332
Yes. Well,
you know mac keefer.

18:41.367 --> 18:44.767
Heard of him. He owns the town,
can buy it and sell it.

18:44.802 --> 18:47.934
Only he doesn't buy it.
He sells it.

18:47.969 --> 18:48.899

You said it before.

You don't have to
worry about it.

some spending money.

19:12.501 --> 19:15.200

to get settled.

that dough together

19:17.286 --> 19:19.232
And tell me
where i come in.

19:19.267 --> 19:21.534

What do you mean?

19:21.569 --> 19:24.168
What business
you want me to handle,

19:24.203 --> 19:26.767
What parts of town,
and what my cut is.

19:26.802 --> 19:27.799
Your cut?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.834

the idea, wasn't it?

the three years.

made the connections,

19:34.152 --> 19:36.400

24:14.602 --> 24:16.032
Oh, my!

24:16.067 --> 24:18.067
We split half,
all right?

24:18.102 --> 24:20.067
Hey, i didn't

24:20.102 --> 24:21.532
Gimme!

24:21.567 --> 24:23.067
You bunch

24:23.102 --> 24:24.901
Stick 'em up!

24:24.936 --> 24:26.701
[Silence]

24:28.234 --> 24:29.799
You're all covered.

24:29.834 --> 24:31.968
Hey, give us a break, mister.
We wasn't even there.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.234
We didn't have nothin'
to do with it.

24:40.234 --> 24:41.950
Say your prayers,
mugs.

24:41.985 --> 24:43.667
On the level, mister!

24:43.702 --> 24:45.065
We wasn't there!

24:45.100 --> 24:46.600
Soapy:
shut up, brats!

24:46.635 --> 24:48.100
Stop your squealin'.

24:51.601 --> 24:53.267
Who's
the leader?

24:53.302 --> 24:54.732
I am.

24:54.767 --> 24:56.267
Come here.

24:58.067 --> 24:59.934
Collect
that dough...

24:59.969 --> 25:01.534
And fast.

25:04.868 --> 25:07.101
Come on. Hand it over.

25:07.136 --> 25:09.334
You, too. Come on.

25:09.369 --> 25:11.065
Here.

25:11.100 --> 25:14.100
Now get 'em up
and turn around.

25:17.601 --> 25:18.998
Hey!

25:19.033 --> 25:20.599
Hey! What's
the matter?

25:20.634 --> 25:23.383
Next time you roll
a guy for his poke,

25:23.418 --> 25:26.133
Make sure he don't
know your hideout.

25:26.168 --> 25:28.001
How'd you know?

25:28.036 --> 25:29.834
Come here, suckers.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.968
Hey, how do you know
this place so good?

25:34.003 --> 25:35.365
Yeah!

25:35.400 --> 25:37.400
Let me show you.
Here.

25:38.767 --> 25:40.734
Look at this.

25:40.769 --> 25:42.666
Hey, you ain't-

25:42.701 --> 25:45.200
You ain't
rocky sullivan!

25:45.235 --> 25:46.933
Rocky sullivan!

25:46.968 --> 25:50.467
Hey, did you get that?
It's rocky sullivan!

25:50.502 --> 25:52.532
We tried to hook you!
What a boner!

25:52.567 --> 25:54.467
The minute you saw us
duck down the alley,

25:54.502 --> 25:56.332
You knew we was
headin' for the hideout.

25:56.367 --> 25:59.400
I took the old shortcut.
What do they call you?

25:59.435 --> 26:01.300
Soapy's the name.
This guy's bim.

26:01.335 --> 26:02.699
This mug here's swing.

26:02.734 --> 26:04.400
This palooka
up here's hunky.

26:04.435 --> 26:05.699
Hi, rocky.

26:05.734 --> 26:07.817
And i'm pasty,
and this guy's crab-Face,

26:07.852 --> 26:09.901
But we just call him crab
for short.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.399
Hi.

26:11.434 --> 26:12.917
Glad to meet you,
rocky.

26:12.952 --> 26:14.376
Fellas,

26:14.411 --> 26:15.801
Hiya, rocky!
Hiya, rocky!

26:15.836 --> 26:16.965
Good to see you!

26:17.000 --> 26:20.734
[Boys talking at once]

26:20.769 --> 26:22.199
Hey, rocky.

26:22.234 --> 26:23.834
Hey, you took
the room above us-

26:23.869 --> 26:25.067
Number 24-
Didn't you?

26:25.102 --> 26:26.232
Yeah.

26:26.267 --> 26:27.732
Sure, sure. We knew.

26:27.767 --> 26:29.466
You knew
when you rolled me?

26:29.501 --> 26:31.267
Certainly, certainly.
Johnny maggione told us,

26:31.302 --> 26:33.232
But he didn't tell us
who you was.

26:33.267 --> 26:35.232
You still shouldn't
have taken a chance.

26:35.267 --> 26:37.267
Never bother anybody
in your own neighborhood.

26:37.302 --> 26:39.118
You kids got
a lot to learn.

26:39.153 --> 26:40.899
You could
learn us, rocky.

26:40.934 --> 26:43.200
How would you like
to have a bite with me?

26:43.235 --> 26:44.732
[Boys yelling]

26:44.767 --> 26:46.399
Go down
to the delicatessen

26:46.434 --> 26:48.684
And get some sandwiches
and pickles and some beer.

26:48.719 --> 26:50.934
Bring 'em over to my place.
We'll have a feed.

26:50.969 --> 26:53.767
[Boys yelling excitedly]

27:01.467 --> 27:03.067
[Coins clinking]

27:09.234 --> 27:10.901
Come on. I'm not
in a bread line no more.

27:10.936 --> 27:12.334
Will ya give me some beans?

27:12.369 --> 27:14.001
All right, all right!

27:14.036 --> 27:15.599
I'm on
no hunger strike.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.933
Give out with
this irish caviar.

27:17.968 --> 27:19.901
Come on. A little more,
you stingy grubber.

27:19.936 --> 27:21.132
Gimme
some pickles.

27:21.167 --> 27:22.532
You don't want
any pickles.

27:22.567 --> 27:24.133
Haa haa haa!
Sure, i want pickles.

27:24.168 --> 27:26.234
You like pickles?
Take 'em.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.732
Boy! Pickles!

27:27.767 --> 27:29.834
What are you doin'?
Goin' into business?

27:29.869 --> 27:31.334
No. Souvenirs. Free.

27:31.369 --> 27:32.599
Oh.

27:32.634 --> 27:33.599
Here, rocky.

27:33.634 --> 27:35.300
Here's your change.
41/2 bucks even.

27:35.335 --> 27:36.933
Where's
the other 50 cents?

27:36.968 --> 27:38.851
We had to buy somethin',
didn't we?

27:38.886 --> 27:40.699
You guys got
an awful lot to learn.

27:40.734 --> 27:43.467
Come on, now. Chuck your
chest up to the wood.

27:43.502 --> 27:45.235
Aw, these beans
are rotten.

27:45.270 --> 27:46.968
Oh. You don't
like the beans?

27:47.003 --> 27:48.332
No!

27:48.367 --> 27:50.098
Ha ha ha ha!

27:50.133 --> 27:52.300
Hey, these beans
taste soapy.

27:52.335 --> 27:53.801
Ahh...
but good!

27:53.836 --> 27:55.300
Very good.

28:00.501 --> 28:01.868
Come in!

28:03.300 --> 28:04.801
Rocky:
hello, jerry.

28:04.836 --> 28:06.132
Hello, rocky.

28:06.167 --> 28:07.632
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?

28:07.667 --> 28:10.434
Just havin' a little bite
to eat with the kids.

28:10.469 --> 28:12.000
Sit in? Right here.

28:12.035 --> 28:13.132
Thanks.

28:13.167 --> 28:14.667
How about
a sandwich?

28:14.702 --> 28:15.884
All right.

28:15.919 --> 28:17.032
Thanks, swing.

28:17.067 --> 28:18.799
It didn't
take you boys long

28:18.834 --> 28:20.784
To get acquainted
with rocky, did it?

28:20.819 --> 28:22.734
Hey, rock, looks like
you and the fadda

28:22.769 --> 28:23.833
Are old pals.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.467
Look, next time you go
down to the hideout,

28:26.502 --> 28:27.532
Look at that old door.

28:27.567 --> 28:29.701
You'll see right next
to my initials-J.C.

28:29.736 --> 28:31.132
Jerry connelly.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.550
You mean fadda
used to hang out

28:32.585 --> 28:33.934
With rocky
at the old boiler-Room?

28:33.969 --> 28:34.933
Certainly did.

28:34.968 --> 28:36.567
Of course, we spend
most of our time

28:36.602 --> 28:38.101
At the gym now,
rocky.

28:38.136 --> 28:39.566
That reminds me,
boys.

28:39.601 --> 28:41.601
I hoped to start that
basketball game today.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.285
We're too busy.
Too busy.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.877
Hey, gimme
a sandwich.

28:44.912 --> 28:46.399
What's the matter,
soapy?

28:46.434 --> 28:49.267
Why don't you want to go
to the basketball game?

28:49.302 --> 28:50.899
It ought to be fun.

28:50.934 --> 28:53.517
What do you think we are?
A bunch of cream puffs?

28:53.552 --> 28:56.100
Hey, imagine us playin'
basketball all of a sudden.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.232
[Laughter]

28:57.267 --> 28:59.517
Oh, yeah? Well,
i'll tell you what.

28:59.552 --> 29:01.732
I'll bet you a buck
to a plug nickel

29:01.767 --> 29:04.167
You can't get the ball
past the other team.

29:04.202 --> 29:06.434
Aw, we'll run 'em
into the ground.

29:06.469 --> 29:07.899
[Boys yelling]

29:07.934 --> 29:09.399
You'll come
with us?

29:09.434 --> 29:11.299
Yeah. Whaddya say?
Is it a bet?

29:11.334 --> 29:13.766
Bim: yeah. I got
a nickel. It's a bet.

29:13.801 --> 29:15.968
We ought to have some
practice first, though.

29:16.003 --> 29:17.467
Gym's open. You can
go over right now.

29:17.502 --> 29:19.634
[Boys yelling excitedly]

29:24.033 --> 29:26.333
Good-Bye, fadda!

29:26.368 --> 29:28.599
[Door closes]

29:28.634 --> 29:30.634
Young roughnecks-I've been
workin' on them for a year.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.151
Can't get anyplace.
You talk to 'em 10 minutes,

29:32.186 --> 29:33.910
They'd jump through a hoop
if you asked 'em to.

29:33.945 --> 29:35.789
Maybe it's because i
wear my collar frontwards.

29:35.824 --> 29:37.634
Maybe. As long as you're
sponsoring the gym,

29:37.669 --> 29:40.133
Let's take a look
at it.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.599
You mean now?

29:41.634 --> 29:43.599
Sure, why not?
Come on, rocky.

29:43.634 --> 29:45.934
You remember old krausmeyer's
store, don't you?

29:45.969 --> 29:48.267
Yeah, sure.
We used to rob it.

29:48.302 --> 29:50.000
Yes! [Chuckles]

29:51.234 --> 29:52.699
Sure, i been trailin' him,

29:52.734 --> 29:54.767
But he's mixed up
with a priest and kids,

29:54.802 --> 29:56.484
And i can't get
a crack at him.

29:56.519 --> 29:58.132
Don't let him
out of your sight.

29:58.167 --> 30:00.667
I'll send bugs down
with a couple boys.

30:02.234 --> 30:06.167
Let's wipe up the floor
with these kids!

30:10.534 --> 30:12.834
Your kids play
a swell game, rocky.

30:12.869 --> 30:14.434
Keep a good eye
on 'em.

30:14.469 --> 30:16.000
Keep your chin
covered.

30:16.035 --> 30:17.132
[Blows whistle]

30:17.167 --> 30:21.767
Clear the floor!
Take the mats off!

30:23.234 --> 30:24.467
Hello.

30:24.502 --> 30:25.918
Hello.

30:25.953 --> 30:27.334
Friends?

30:27.369 --> 30:29.199
Ok.

30:29.234 --> 30:30.384
What have
you been doin',

30:30.419 --> 30:31.560
Playin' a duck
for me?

30:31.595 --> 30:32.666
I wasn't
gonna hurt you.

30:32.701 --> 30:34.968
No. I'd forgotten you were
in the neighborhood.

30:35.003 --> 30:37.165
Oh.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.833
Well, uh,
what are you doin'?

30:39.868 --> 30:42.467
Same thing
you're doing-

30:42.502 --> 30:43.467
Watching the game.

30:45.901 --> 30:47.701
Say, uh, you know,
you turned out to be

30:47.736 --> 30:49.200
A pretty
snappy-Lookin' dish.

30:49.235 --> 30:50.165
Thanks.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.501
For a sociable
worker.

30:51.536 --> 30:52.799
Thanks again.

30:52.834 --> 30:53.933
I can't figure out

30:53.968 --> 30:55.466
Why some smart guy
hasn't grabbed you off.

30:55.501 --> 30:58.234
Some smart guy who's always
in the headlines, huh?

31:00.734 --> 31:02.501
You could do worse.

31:06.234 --> 31:08.132
[Blows whistle]

31:08.167 --> 31:09.984
You know better
than that.

31:10.019 --> 31:11.801
Wait till
i blow the whistle.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.901
Ok.
Let's get goin'.

Run! Run!

31:34.868 --> 31:36.599
Free throw.

31:36.634 --> 31:40.467
Oh, no! That's not fair.
He didn't do nothin'.

31:40.502 --> 31:42.384
Come on!

31:42.419 --> 31:44.267
That's it.

31:53.634 --> 31:55.634
Come on!
Take it down!

31:55.669 --> 31:56.801
I got my man!

32:03.367 --> 32:04.550
[Blows whistle]

32:04.585 --> 32:05.699
You do that again,

32:05.734 --> 32:07.550
I'll take you
out of the game.

32:07.585 --> 32:09.367
I didn't do nothin'.
He's screwy.

32:09.402 --> 32:10.666
Give us a break.

32:10.701 --> 32:12.667
Can't you even shove
a guy in this game?

32:12.702 --> 32:14.934
What do you mean,
shove a guy?

32:14.969 --> 32:17.167
It's a free throw,
gibby. Take it.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.501
That's not fair!

32:25.000 --> 32:27.167
Hey, dribble that ball
and pass it.

32:27.202 --> 32:28.501
Dribble that.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.200
[Blows whistle]

32:32.235 --> 32:33.399
Foul!

32:33.434 --> 32:36.167
That big bozo
just stuck his belly out.

32:36.202 --> 32:38.132
You boys know
better than that.

32:38.167 --> 32:39.634
You've been committing
technical fouls

32:39.669 --> 32:41.151
And personal fouls.
Now, stop it.

32:41.186 --> 32:42.634
You've got six men
on the floor.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.232
Pasty, get off the floor.

32:44.267 --> 32:45.634
Somebody, take care of
that trapeze.

32:45.669 --> 32:47.651
Just be my good deed
for today.

32:47.686 --> 32:49.634
All right.
Red out. Take it.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.066
[Blows whistle]

32:58.101 --> 33:00.133
Here.
Watch this.

33:01.634 --> 33:03.134
Make a few notes.

33:03.169 --> 33:04.599
All right, boys!

33:04.634 --> 33:06.900
Mr. Sullivan's

Go on.

33:10.667 --> 33:12.417
Get off the floor!

33:12.452 --> 33:14.193
What am i,

33:14.228 --> 33:15.899
Now! Get goin'!
Ow!

33:15.934 --> 33:17.934
Don't forget.
Accordin' to rules, now.

33:17.969 --> 33:19.634
Here we go.
Wait for the whistle.

might be interesting

43:49.669 --> 43:50.965
To know more about.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.133
You know just about
everybody in town.

43:53.168 --> 43:54.833
You made 'em sign,
too.

43:54.868 --> 43:57.634
That's the way you held
the club over 'em, huh?

43:57.669 --> 43:59.098
I'm gonna take this
and study up.

43:59.133 --> 44:02.167
One partner should know
what the other is doin'.

44:02.202 --> 44:03.567
What's keefer's number?

44:03.602 --> 44:05.098
Circle 0500.

44:05.133 --> 44:06.133
His private number.

44:06.168 --> 44:07.217
That's it.

44:07.252 --> 44:08.232
Dial it.

44:08.267 --> 44:09.766
Now, look. You're
gonna get on there

44:09.801 --> 44:12.234
And tell keefer i'm comin'

44:12.269 --> 44:14.400
He's to give me
that 100 grand.

44:14.435 --> 44:15.666
And no wrong cracks,

44:15.701 --> 44:18.184
Or i'll cut you off

44:18.219 --> 44:20.693
Hello, mac.
This is rocky.

44:20.728 --> 44:22.947
Yeah.
Surprise, surprise.

44:22.982 --> 44:24.824
No, i ain't

44:24.859 --> 44:26.632
That's one
of your own boys.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.767
Frazier's here.
He wants to talk.

44:28.802 --> 44:29.799
Hello. Mac?

44:29.834 --> 44:31.901
Rocky will be up
the el toro in the morning.

44:31.936 --> 44:32.965
About 11:00.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.332
That'll give him time
to get to the bank.

44:34.367 --> 44:36.632
11:00. That'll give you
time to get to the bank.

44:36.667 --> 44:38.434
I want you to take $100,000
out of my personal account

44:38.469 --> 44:39.965
And give it to him.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.834
What's up?
Is he holding you?

44:41.869 --> 44:42.833
Tell him yes.

44:42.868 --> 44:45.098
Yes. You've got
to do it, mac.

44:45.133 --> 44:47.234
You understand?
You've got to do it.

44:47.269 --> 44:49.018
Ok.
I'll give it to him.

44:49.053 --> 44:50.732
And tell him
no slip-Ups.

44:50.767 --> 44:53.033
And no slip-Ups.
It's very important to me.

44:53.068 --> 44:55.434
Ok, ok.
I said i'd give it to him.

44:55.469 --> 44:58.701
Mac, i get you
out of bed?

44:58.736 --> 45:00.200
Oh, i'm so sorry.

45:01.801 --> 45:03.300
I think he's sore.

45:13.801 --> 45:16.634
Morning, gentlemen.
Nice day for a murder.

45:16.669 --> 45:17.699
Where's frazier?

45:17.734 --> 45:18.998
Where's that 100 grand?

45:19.033 --> 45:20.632
Think we're gonna
pay off, huh?

45:20.667 --> 45:22.167
Certainly. If i don't get
that dough in three minutes,

45:22.202 --> 45:24.501
Frazier will be splashed
all over my hideout.

45:24.536 --> 45:26.801
You don't expect
to get away with this.

45:26.836 --> 45:28.132
Why not?

45:28.167 --> 45:29.968
I guess we can
make you talk.

45:30.003 --> 45:32.085
Uh-Huh.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.132
All right.

45:34.167 --> 45:36.132
Suppose you don't
make me talk.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.167
I give you a wrong number.
Maybe another wrong number.

45:38.202 --> 45:39.801
Meanwhile,
frazier's watchin' the clock,

45:39.836 --> 45:42.167
And waitin'
for the phone to ring.

45:42.202 --> 45:44.868
How much you like
frazier?

45:44.903 --> 45:47.033
Give him the dough.

45:47.068 --> 45:48.132
Well, look-

45:48.167 --> 45:50.167
Give him the dough.

45:53.534 --> 45:57.367
Look. Suppose you don't
produce frazier.

45:57.402 --> 45:59.301
What do i want
with him?

45:59.336 --> 46:01.165
All right. 100 grand.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.200
Now give me a phone
and an outside line.

46:07.701 --> 46:09.701

46:21.636 --> 46:22.566
But don't call

46:22.601 --> 46:24.184
If you see me
smokin' a cigarette.

46:24.219 --> 46:26.176
That means

46:39.133 --> 46:41.098
See, when i walk
past that window,

46:41.133 --> 46:44.167
Frazier will be sprung...
unless i'm followed.

46:44.202 --> 46:46.367
Ok. Beat it,
and let him go.

46:50.300 --> 46:51.332
[Door slams]

46:51.367 --> 46:54.634
We'll get him as soon
as we see frazier.

46:54.669 --> 46:56.599
I got a better idea.

46:56.634 --> 46:59.133
Get me the tyson street

47:10.202 --> 47:12.132
I'm gonna give you

47:12.167 --> 47:14.167
Last night,
rocky sullivan snatched frazier.

47:14.202 --> 47:16.384
I just paid off
100 grand to him.

47:16.419 --> 47:18.567

I don't get you.

47:27.402 --> 47:28.666
Yeah.
What's the idea

47:28.701 --> 47:30.532
Of bringing
the cops in on it?

47:30.567 --> 47:33.267
Because i'm not a mug.
I'm smart, see?

47:33.302 --> 47:35.065
Sure, you'd like
rough stuff.

47:35.100 --> 47:37.601
Why? When you can do it
nice and legal?

47:37.636 --> 47:39.065
No trouble, no fuss.

47:39.100 --> 47:41.098

50:13.302 --> 50:15.065
Quiet! Quiet!

50:15.100 --> 50:17.065
What'd the cops
jug him for?

50:17.100 --> 50:19.065
He didn't have time
to tell me nothin'.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.067
He just gives me this
and he tells me to hide it.

50:21.102 --> 50:23.033
What do you think's
in it?

50:23.068 --> 50:24.332
How should i know?

50:28.501 --> 50:30.299
Rocky said
not to open it. See?

All right, all right,
i was just askin'.

50:32.536 --> 50:34.432
How'd you get away
with it?

50:34.467 --> 50:37.133
Them cops passed me
right on the stairs.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.432
They don't know
nothin'.

50:38.467 --> 50:41.634
And me with this
in me shirt.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.467
You're all wrong, boys.
There was no snatch.

50:46.502 --> 50:49.634
Me and frazier was away
on a business trip.

50:49.669 --> 50:51.601
Spill. We've got
the dope anyway.

50:51.636 --> 50:53.801
Let me call my lawyer.

I don't know how you
feel. You look terrible.

51:09.702 --> 51:12.000
It wasn't a picnic
in the cellar

51:12.035 --> 51:13.566
With the rats
and dirt.

51:13.601 --> 51:16.350
That'll teach you to leave
the rough stuff to me.

51:16.385 --> 51:19.100
Is it my fault if your apes
can't get the right man?

51:19.135 --> 51:20.801
You didn't put anybody
after sullivan, did you?

51:20.836 --> 51:23.132
No. You did that
once too often.

51:23.167 --> 51:24.834
I'm lettin' the coppers
take care of him.

51:24.869 --> 51:25.965
You what?!

51:26.000 --> 51:27.833
I tipped them off
that he snatched you.

51:27.868 --> 51:29.701
I just got word from
buckley he picked him up.

51:29.736 --> 51:32.200
That's just what
you shouldn't have done.

51:32.235 --> 51:33.468
But
it's already done.

51:33.503 --> 51:34.666
You don't understand.

51:34.701 --> 51:35.766
Sullivan picked me up
at my home.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.251
He's got everything
that was in my safe-

names, addresses,

51:38.736 --> 51:40.165

51:40.200 --> 51:42.200
If he's prosecuted for
this kidnapping, he'll talk.

51:42.235 --> 51:44.499
He's got evidence
to back it up.

51:44.534 --> 51:46.634
He'll tear this whole town
wide open.

51:46.669 --> 51:48.934
We gotta pull him
out of there.

a boner, you did.

54:05.701 --> 54:07.450
Now, look,
you don't know

54:07.485 --> 54:09.093
Anything
about this, see?

54:09.128 --> 54:10.666
No. No. I don't
know nothin'.

54:10.701 --> 54:13.200
But you do know
what guys get who talk.

54:13.235 --> 54:14.234
Yeah.

54:14.269 --> 54:15.199
Huh?

54:15.234 --> 54:16.501
Yeah, yeah.

54:17.634 --> 54:22.267
Now, look, that goes
for the rest of you.

54:22.302 --> 54:24.167
You understand?

54:24.202 --> 54:25.167
Certainly.

54:25.202 --> 54:26.165
Sure!

54:26.200 --> 54:27.634
All right.
Now we're pals.

54:27.669 --> 54:29.634
Put her there, rocky.

54:36.133 --> 54:41.100
All right, soapy.
Here you are.

54:41.135 --> 54:42.199
[Whistle]

54:42.234 --> 54:44.051
Cut that up
any way you like.

54:44.086 --> 54:45.868
It's ok.
I just saw it made.

54:45.903 --> 54:47.632
Thanks, rocky.

54:47.667 --> 54:48.632
You don't
have to worry

54:48.667 --> 54:50.167
About the guys
talkin', either.

54:50.202 --> 54:51.667
We once had a squealer
in the gang,

54:51.702 --> 54:53.434
But now he ain't
got no teeth.

54:53.469 --> 54:55.167
I'll see you
in a couple days.

54:56.167 --> 54:58.132
So long, rocky!

54:58.167 --> 55:01.334
Bye, rock!
Have a good time!

55:01.369 --> 55:02.667
Come on, guys!

55:02.702 --> 55:04.799
Yeah!

55:04.834 --> 55:05.901
You want to see
what it's like?

55:05.936 --> 55:08.098
Yeah!
Here's your cut.

55:08.133 --> 55:10.501
Come on.
Give me some of that.

55:10.536 --> 55:12.101
50 bucks! Wow!

55:12.136 --> 55:13.632
50 bucks! Wow!

55:13.667 --> 55:16.334
And the same for
the rest of youse, too.

55:16.369 --> 55:17.732
Oh, boy.
50 simoleons.

55:17.767 --> 55:19.133
My old man never
made that much dough

55:19.168 --> 55:20.165
In his whole life

55:20.200 --> 55:22.467
Workin' for the department
of sanitation.

55:22.502 --> 55:24.467
How much you got
there, soapy?

55:24.502 --> 55:26.068
About 100.

55:26.103 --> 55:27.599
100? How come?

55:27.634 --> 55:29.599
That's twice
as much as i got.

55:29.634 --> 55:31.967
You want to make
somethin' out of it?

55:32.002 --> 55:34.300
He deserves it.
He hid all the stuff.

55:34.335 --> 55:35.766
You pull in
your ears.

55:35.801 --> 55:37.332
Say, what are we
gonna do with it?

55:37.367 --> 55:40.367
This is burnin' a hole
right through my hands.

55:40.402 --> 55:42.632
I'm gonna
get me a pair

55:42.667 --> 55:44.634
Of chromium-Plated
brass knuckles.

55:44.669 --> 55:46.618
Come on! Let's go!

55:46.653 --> 55:48.567
[Excited chatter]

56:02.133 --> 56:04.666
[Knock on door]

56:04.701 --> 56:05.833
Can i come in,
rocky?

56:05.868 --> 56:08.167
Yeah. Wait
a minute, jerry.

56:12.167 --> 56:15.667
Just a second.
I want to dry me hands.

56:20.667 --> 56:22.167
Hello, jerry.

56:22.202 --> 56:23.632
Hello, rocky.

56:23.667 --> 56:25.000
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?

56:25.035 --> 56:26.132
What do you say?

56:26.167 --> 56:28.200
You gave me
a terrific scare.

56:28.235 --> 56:29.432
Huh?

56:29.467 --> 56:31.200
Before i finished reading
about you being arrested,

56:31.235 --> 56:33.501
There were headlines
saying you were out.

56:33.536 --> 56:35.165
There was
nothin' to it.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.165
You know how it is with
a guy with a record.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.701
Haul him in because they
have nothing else to do.

56:39.736 --> 56:41.167
What are you worrying about?

56:41.202 --> 56:42.201
Plenty.

56:42.236 --> 56:43.165
What's up?

56:43.200 --> 56:45.200
Soapy and the boys
had a return game

56:45.235 --> 56:46.599
At the gym today,

56:46.634 --> 56:48.232
And they haven't
shown up.

56:48.267 --> 56:50.233
Thought you might know
where they were.

56:50.268 --> 56:52.200
How would i know?
What am i, a nursemaid?

56:52.235 --> 56:53.717
No, rocky.
I didn't mean that.

56:53.752 --> 56:55.276
Thought they might
be up here

56:55.311 --> 56:56.766
Celebrating
your release.

56:56.801 --> 56:59.651
With them, it's kind of
a hero worship.

56:59.686 --> 57:02.466
You can't blame 'em
for that, can you?

57:02.501 --> 57:06.167
Rocky, why don't you tell me
what it's all about?

57:06.202 --> 57:08.184
Look, jerry,
i've been answerin'

57:08.219 --> 57:10.167
A lot of questions
all mornin', see?

57:10.202 --> 57:11.667
A lot of 'em.

57:14.267 --> 57:15.299
Frazier and me
were just away

57:15.334 --> 57:16.667
On a little business trip,
that's all.

57:20.534 --> 57:22.199
Some dope wanted
to start some trouble

57:22.234 --> 57:24.868
And happened upon the cops
at the same time.

57:24.903 --> 57:26.833
Spread a false alarm,
that's all.

57:26.868 --> 57:29.534
I'm glad it wasn't
any more than that.

57:29.569 --> 57:30.699
[Knock on door]

57:30.734 --> 57:32.699
Hello, laury!
Whaddya say?

57:32.734 --> 57:35.067
This looks like it's
gonna be a big day.

57:35.102 --> 57:37.400
I have to admit,
i was pretty worried.

57:37.435 --> 57:39.267
That sounds very nice
to hear.

57:39.302 --> 57:40.232
Well, father,

57:40.267 --> 57:42.767
I finally located
our precious angels.

57:42.802 --> 57:44.032
You did? Where?

57:44.067 --> 57:45.234
Over
in murphy's poolroom.

57:45.269 --> 57:46.199
What?

57:46.234 --> 57:47.499
Yeah, soapy
and the gang.

57:47.534 --> 57:49.767
They're passing out beer
to the neighborhood kids.

57:49.802 --> 57:51.767
Throwing dollar bills around
like confetti.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.767
Wonder where
they got the money.

57:53.802 --> 57:55.165
You might ask them.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.868
Well, i'm gonna be
going, rocky.

57:58.903 --> 58:01.265
So soon?

58:01.300 --> 58:02.450
Coming, laury?

58:02.485 --> 58:03.566
No, father.

58:03.601 --> 58:06.334
I want to stay and talk
to rocky for a while.

58:06.369 --> 58:08.535
When will i see you,
rocky?

58:08.570 --> 58:10.701
I'll catch up
with you.

58:10.736 --> 58:13.200
Ok. Bye.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.700
Well, rocky,
i guess-

58:21.735 --> 58:23.165
Now, wait a minute.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.868
You're the kind of gal
that's smart enough

58:25.903 --> 58:27.701
To mind
her own business.

58:27.736 --> 58:29.299
Am i right or wrong?

58:29.334 --> 58:31.267
Don't worry.
I know all the rules.

58:32.267 --> 58:34.984
Get your 10 here!
All bets covered!

58:35.019 --> 58:37.360
Where'd you get
the dough, pasty?

58:37.395 --> 58:39.666
We wrote
to santa claus, see.

58:39.701 --> 58:42.033
Then when we
woke up this morning,

58:42.068 --> 58:43.998
There it was
in our socks.

58:44.033 --> 58:46.100
All bets covered.
Come on, boys.

58:46.135 --> 58:47.734
[Men arguing]

58:50.834 --> 58:52.199
Give me another one.

58:52.234 --> 58:54.199
What do you mean,
another one?

58:54.234 --> 58:56.901
You tryin' to gyp
the kid or somethin'?

58:56.936 --> 58:58.267
He owes me
five bucks.

58:58.302 --> 58:59.634
Shut up!

59:02.868 --> 59:04.399
Dirty tables
aggravate me.

59:04.434 --> 59:06.033
You're gonna make
this shot, you know.

59:06.068 --> 59:08.400
Put your eightball
on the corner.

59:08.435 --> 59:09.866
Ok.
All right.

59:09.901 --> 59:11.866
Hey, bury that beef,
will ya?

59:11.901 --> 59:15.234
Pull in your head
and get that off the table!

59:15.269 --> 59:17.634
Got a threeball
off the corner.

59:20.734 --> 59:23.566
Nice shot, boy!
Eight bucks!

59:23.601 --> 59:26.267
My mother has to
work almost all week

59:26.302 --> 59:27.951
To make
this much.

59:27.986 --> 59:29.566
Give, give, give!

59:29.601 --> 59:31.300
All right.
All right.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.550
All gamblers
die broke.

59:35.585 --> 59:37.965
Hey, soapy,
you promised us

59:38.000 --> 59:40.117
Another round
of beers if you won.

59:40.152 --> 59:42.199
Ok, go on.
Bring up another case.

59:42.234 --> 59:45.334
What's the difference?
Those chumps are payin' for it.

59:46.901 --> 59:48.899
What is this,
a raid?

59:48.934 --> 59:50.983
No. Maybe
they're gonna make

59:51.018 --> 59:53.033
A sunday school
out of it.

59:53.068 --> 59:54.499
Come on.

59:54.534 --> 59:56.499
I'll take two.
Give me two.

59:56.534 --> 59:59.200
Aren't you boys
goin' over to the gym

59:59.235 --> 01:00:00.767
And start that game?

01:00:00.802 --> 01:00:02.165
Sure, father.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.799
We just
wanted to see

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:05.567
What was going on
in here.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.300
Come on, joe.
Come on, kids.

01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:09.367

01:00:21.269 --> 01:00:23.766
Yeah.

01:00:23.801 --> 01:00:26.133
Why don't you give it
over at the gym?

01:00:27.334 --> 01:00:29.432
'Cause i'm
havin' it here.

01:00:29.467 --> 01:00:31.701

you asked for?

on that shot, ok?

meant anything to you?

What makes you think
hanging around hoodlums,

with a lot of hoodlums

ain't no future

Can't a guy even
have any fun?

01:01:21.235 --> 01:01:22.834
It's a waste
of time.

Can't you get 'em to go
to heaven with ya?

You got the wrong
slant, honey.

still figurin'

things can go.

You've been readin' stuff
about "crime don't pay. "

the cops every day, rocky.

You do if you're
smart. Come here.

You see those white
lights up there?

of mine hangs together.

01:02:48.919 --> 01:02:50.232
Rocky
sullivan.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.766
Oh, yes. Sure, of course.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.100
There you are, baby.
Try your luck.

01:02:53.135 --> 01:02:54.767
I got some business
to attend to.

01:02:54.802 --> 01:02:56.400
I'll be back
in a little while.

01:02:56.435 --> 01:02:57.400
But, rocky,
i'm not lucky.

01:02:57.435 --> 01:02:58.365
Don't be afraid.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.534
Let your hair down.
Have fun. Go ahead.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.534
How much are these?

01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:03.499
$50 each.

01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:04.800
Change them
to dollar chips.

01:03:04.835 --> 01:03:06.067
But mr. Sullivan
wants black.

01:03:06.102 --> 01:03:07.032
I don't
like black.

01:03:07.067 --> 01:03:08.866
Oh, you don't
like black.

01:03:08.901 --> 01:03:11.684
Seeing as how jim
owed you the dough

01:03:11.719 --> 01:03:14.093
And it being
a misunderstanding,

01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:16.467
We decided
to call it square

01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:17.965
With no
hard feelings,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.033
Especially now
you're in the know.

01:03:20.068 --> 01:03:22.067
You boys really want
to talk business?

01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:23.332
Ok, let's talk.

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:25.467
Look here, rocky, what
about those accounts

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:27.065
You took from my safe?

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.750
I figured it was
good insurance,

01:03:28.785 --> 01:03:30.400
In case you boys
change your minds.

01:03:30.435 --> 01:03:31.917
What do you
want, rocky?

01:03:31.952 --> 01:03:33.365
Nothin' from you, mac,

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.033
Just my original
agreement with frazier-

01:03:35.068 --> 01:03:37.067
50% of his share
of everything.

01:03:37.102 --> 01:03:39.067
That sounds fair
enough, jim.

01:03:39.102 --> 01:03:42.866
All right. It's a deal.

01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:45.934
I'm gonna take very good
care of those accounts.

01:03:45.969 --> 01:03:48.332
I wouldn't do anything
i'd be sorry for

01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:50.834
Because i'm gonna pay
very special attention

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:52.634
To those books.
You understand?

01:03:52.669 --> 01:03:54.635
If it's a deal
between you guys,

01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:56.385
It's just like
it was on paper.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.100
I always do
everything legal.

01:03:58.135 --> 01:03:59.632
Oh, yeah, i know that.

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:02.801
Now, partners, i'll have
my accountant go over the books

01:04:02.836 --> 01:04:04.834
To make sure you boys
ain't cheating.

01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:06.334
Fair enough?
Yeah.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:07.734
Ok.

01:04:11.334 --> 01:04:12.933
How long
do you think

01:04:12.968 --> 01:04:15.632
I'll let that guy
sit in my chair?

01:04:15.667 --> 01:04:18.567
As long as he hangs
onto that information.

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.417
You like this place?

01:04:29.452 --> 01:04:31.242
Sure.
Why wouldn't i?

01:04:31.277 --> 01:04:33.033
Just got
a piece of it.

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:34.399
Rocky.
Yeah?

01:04:34.434 --> 01:04:35.901
Maybe you are
smart enough.

01:04:35.936 --> 01:04:37.466
Baby, how'd you like

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:38.734
To give up that two-
For-A-Nickel job

01:04:38.769 --> 01:04:40.067
And move in here?

01:04:40.102 --> 01:04:41.365
Doin' what?

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.968
Just sittin' around,
lookin' pretty,

01:04:43.003 --> 01:04:44.901
Dance a little,
play a little.

01:04:44.936 --> 01:04:46.199
Kind of a hostess.

01:04:46.234 --> 01:04:47.834
Give you $100 a week
and expenses.

01:04:47.869 --> 01:04:49.766
It'll be
very nice to have

01:04:49.801 --> 01:04:51.400
At least one friend
in this place.

01:05:05.133 --> 01:05:06.434
[Knocking on door]

01:05:07.434 --> 01:05:08.434
Come in.

01:05:10.133 --> 01:05:11.766
Yes, mrs. Mcgee,
what is it?

01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:13.884
I've had your lunch
waitin' since noon.

01:05:13.919 --> 01:05:15.659
Then this package
came by messenger.

01:05:15.694 --> 01:05:17.400
I thought maybe
it was important,

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:18.767
So i brought it up.

01:05:18.802 --> 01:05:20.065
All right.
Thank you.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.265
Is there anything
wrong, father?

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.400
No, no, nothing.
Oh, i won't have any lunch.

01:05:25.435 --> 01:05:27.551
If i'd known
that this morning,

01:05:27.586 --> 01:05:29.667
I could have saved
some money.

01:05:59.033 --> 01:06:02.567
You wait. I'll tell him
you're here.

01:06:02.602 --> 01:06:04.567
Uh, make yourself
at home.

01:06:04.602 --> 01:06:06.200
Thanks.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.184
Hi, jerry. Whaddya
hear? Whaddya say?

01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:19.968
What are you doin',
tryin' your luck?

01:06:20.003 --> 01:06:20.933
Yes, i'd like to,

01:06:20.968 --> 01:06:22.968
But i haven't
got any money.

01:06:23.003 --> 01:06:25.135
Except this.
And it's not mine.

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:27.267
Where did you get
ahold of that?

01:06:27.302 --> 01:06:28.801
Where did you?

01:06:28.836 --> 01:06:29.866
Huh?

01:06:29.901 --> 01:06:32.567
Here, rocky. Thanks,
but i can't accept it.

01:06:32.602 --> 01:06:33.701
You silly
or somethin'?

01:06:33.736 --> 01:06:34.833
That ain't mine.

01:06:34.868 --> 01:06:37.234
I know it isn't.
That's why i can't take it.

01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:38.699
What is this?

01:06:38.734 --> 01:06:40.666
You flash
this wad on me,

01:06:40.701 --> 01:06:43.334
Then try to tell me
the dough is mine.

01:06:43.369 --> 01:06:45.933
You've got a great
poker face, rocky,

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.784
But don't forget i've known
that face a long time.

01:06:48.819 --> 01:06:51.601
I know you forced frazier
to get you $100,000.

01:06:51.636 --> 01:06:52.868
Everybody knows it.

01:06:52.903 --> 01:06:54.065
What's the difference

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.599
Where the dough
came from?

01:06:55.634 --> 01:06:57.900
Frazier owed it to me.
It was mine.

01:06:57.935 --> 01:07:00.167
Better you get
a chunk of it than him.

01:07:00.202 --> 01:07:01.766
Suppose the dough
is hot?

01:07:01.801 --> 01:07:03.534
Nobody knows that
but you and me.

01:07:03.569 --> 01:07:04.866
That's just it.

01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:06.767
Oh, come on.
Don't be such an angel.

01:07:06.802 --> 01:07:08.634
You want to get
that center built?

01:07:08.669 --> 01:07:09.732
Go ahead!
Get it started!

01:07:09.767 --> 01:07:12.467
I don't want to build
on rotten foundations.

01:07:12.502 --> 01:07:14.032
Ah, don't be
a sucker!

01:07:14.067 --> 01:07:16.834
All right, rocky.
Supposing i take the money,

01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:19.601
I kid myself that
it's a means to an end.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.799
Well, it isn't.
It never will be.

01:07:21.834 --> 01:07:24.334
Inside the center,
my boys will be clean,

01:07:24.369 --> 01:07:25.933
And outside,
they'd be surrounded

01:07:25.968 --> 01:07:28.968
By the same rotten corruption
and crime and criminals.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.518
Yes,
yourself included.

01:07:30.553 --> 01:07:31.998
Criminals on all sides

01:07:32.033 --> 01:07:34.183
For my boys to look up to
and revere

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:36.299
And respect,
admire and imitate.

01:07:36.334 --> 01:07:39.267
What earthly good
is it for me to teach them

01:07:39.302 --> 01:07:41.165
Honesty is the best policy

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.167
When all around, they see
dishonesty is a better policy?

01:07:43.202 --> 01:07:44.866
The hoodlum and gangster

01:07:44.901 --> 01:07:46.332
Is looked up to
with the same respect

01:07:46.367 --> 01:07:50.367
As the successful businessman
or popular hero-

01:07:50.402 --> 01:07:52.998
You, the fraziers,
the keefers,

01:07:53.033 --> 01:07:55.334
And all the rest of
those rotten politicians

01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:57.901
You've got in the palm
of your hand.

01:07:57.936 --> 01:08:00.399
Yes, and you've got
my boys, too.

01:08:00.434 --> 01:08:03.501
Whatever i teach them,
you show me up.

01:08:03.536 --> 01:08:05.699
You show them
the easiest way,

01:08:05.734 --> 01:08:09.167
The quickest way is
with a racket or a gun.

01:08:09.202 --> 01:08:10.834
Well, it's so,
ain't it?

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:12.799
[Drops cards]

01:08:12.834 --> 01:08:15.968
Yes, it's so... god help us.

01:08:16.002 --> 01:08:17.466
You see, rocky...

01:08:17.501 --> 01:08:20.567
I thought i could
solve my problems...

01:08:20.602 --> 01:08:23.432
Problems with my boys-

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.599
Which, after all,
they are-

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:26.584
From the bottom up.
But i can't.

01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:28.533
I've gotta start
from the top down.

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:29.499
Yeah? How?

01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:31.064
I'll tell you how.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.600
I'm gonna use
your case

01:08:32.635 --> 01:08:34.064
Of kidnapping
frazier

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.750
As a crowbar to uncover
this cesspool.

01:08:36.785 --> 01:08:39.365
I'm gonna force the law,
corrupt or not,

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.600
To indict, prosecute and
bring to the light of day

01:08:41.636 --> 01:08:42.734
This entire filthy affair.

01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:43.899
There's gonna be

01:08:43.934 --> 01:08:46.317
A lot of people
stepped on, rocky,

01:08:46.352 --> 01:08:48.859
And if you happen
to get in the way,

01:08:48.894 --> 01:08:51.367
I'll be sorry,
but you'll be stepped on

01:08:51.402 --> 01:08:52.332
Just as hard.

01:08:52.367 --> 01:08:53.832
All right, jerry,
go to it.

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:56.300
But you've got as much chance
of gettin' an indictment

01:08:56.335 --> 01:08:58.631
As i have of gettin'
into bible society.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:01.667
You'll find nobody cares
about the whole thing.

01:09:01.702 --> 01:09:04.667
You'll find 'em laughing,
end up with blind alleys.

01:09:04.702 --> 01:09:06.268
But go ahead, kid.

01:09:06.303 --> 01:09:07.799
If i'm in your way,

01:09:07.834 --> 01:09:09.834
Keep on steppin'
just as hard.

01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:11.466
For being honest

01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:14.365
And for
old times' sake,

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.267
There's one favor i'm
gonna have to ask you.

01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:19.318
Maybe i won't be
able to return it.

01:09:19.353 --> 01:09:22.334
Well, go ahead.
Anything you say.

01:09:22.368 --> 01:09:23.832
Soapy
and those kids-

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.832
Give 'em a break,
will ya?

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:28.032
Don't offer 'em
any more money.

01:09:28.067 --> 01:09:31.466
Don't encourage them
to... admire you.

01:09:31.502 --> 01:09:33.185
All right.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.193
I'll do that.

01:09:35.228 --> 01:09:37.167
Sure, you will.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.200
Father connelly,
i'd like to help you,

01:10:04.235 --> 01:10:06.332
But we can't
get away with it.

01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:08.467
The organization is
too powerful to fight.

01:10:12.634 --> 01:10:14.934
You know what you're
asking of me.

01:10:14.969 --> 01:10:16.299
Yes, mr. White.

01:10:16.334 --> 01:10:19.000
The other papers have
gone to great lengths

01:10:19.035 --> 01:10:20.998
To explain
the risks to me.

01:10:21.033 --> 01:10:23.033
You'll go into
the fight personally,

01:10:23.068 --> 01:10:24.998
Devote your full time
to it?

01:10:25.033 --> 01:10:26.950
Believe me, nothing
would please me more.

01:10:26.985 --> 01:10:28.868
Very well, father connelly,
i'm with you.

01:10:28.903 --> 01:10:31.534
The presswill
back you to the limit.

01:10:31.569 --> 01:10:33.434
Thank you,
and i appreciate it.

01:10:54.267 --> 01:10:57.300
Get me the inside on frazier
and keefer's bank accounts.

01:10:57.335 --> 01:10:59.933
I don't care where
you get the dope.

01:10:59.968 --> 01:11:03.634
Pap, get information on frazier
before he got to this town,

01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:05.899
If he'd been mixed up
with sullivan.

01:11:05.934 --> 01:11:09.834
Jenkins, find out how many
of keefer's men have been sprung

01:11:09.869 --> 01:11:12.235
Since frazier moved in.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:14.566
Why are you hounding rocky?

01:11:14.601 --> 01:11:17.501
Why are you trying to send
him to prison for life?

01:11:17.536 --> 01:11:19.567
You can't do that to rocky.
I won't let you.

01:11:19.602 --> 01:11:21.367
It's not his fault,
father.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:23.101
He was just a kid

01:11:23.136 --> 01:11:24.766
Who made a mistake

01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:26.900
And got sent
to reform school.

01:11:26.935 --> 01:11:28.965
They made a criminal
out of him,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.601
But he's not really bad.
You know that.

01:11:31.636 --> 01:11:33.534
And whatever they've
done to him,

01:11:33.569 --> 01:11:35.334
No matter
what he is now,

01:11:35.369 --> 01:11:37.234
Whether he's
right or wrong,

01:11:37.269 --> 01:11:39.368
We both love him,
father.

01:11:39.403 --> 01:11:41.467
Yes, laury,
we both love him.

01:11:41.502 --> 01:11:42.933
I've loved him

01:11:42.968 --> 01:11:45.499
Since we were kids
6 years old.

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:48.501
We worked together,
fought together...

01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:50.466
Stole together.

01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:52.234
Oh, i'm not
blaming rocky

01:11:52.269 --> 01:11:54.101
For what
he is today.

01:11:54.136 --> 01:11:55.934
But for
the grace of god,

01:11:55.969 --> 01:11:57.365
There walk i.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.483
I'd do anything
for him, laury,

01:11:59.518 --> 01:12:01.567
Anything in the world
to help him.

01:12:01.602 --> 01:12:03.701
I'd give my life
if i thought

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.501
It'd do any good.

01:12:05.536 --> 01:12:06.901
But it wouldn't.

01:12:06.936 --> 01:12:08.232
You see, laury,

01:12:08.267 --> 01:12:10.033
There's all
those other kids,

01:12:10.068 --> 01:12:11.899
Hundreds of them,

01:12:11.934 --> 01:12:14.534
In the streets,
in bad environment,

01:12:14.569 --> 01:12:16.668
Whom i don't
want to see

01:12:16.703 --> 01:12:18.732
Grow up
like rocky did.

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:21.133
I can't sacrifice
them for rocky.

01:12:21.168 --> 01:12:23.098
You see, laury,

01:12:23.133 --> 01:12:25.983
They have lives,
too.

01:12:26.018 --> 01:12:28.834
I can't
throw them away.

01:12:28.869 --> 01:12:30.300
I can't.

01:12:45.734 --> 01:12:49.701
Connelly: the very fact
that countless thousands of you

01:12:49.736 --> 01:12:51.165
Are listening in tonight

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.501
Is proof to these cynics
that the public does care

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.466
And does propose
to do something

01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:59.534
About the appalling conditions
i have tried to describe.

01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:02.432
Do not doubt that our efforts
have not struck panic

01:13:02.467 --> 01:13:05.467
Into the cesspool of official
and near-Official corruption.

01:13:05.502 --> 01:13:07.833
Yeah, i'm shaking
like a leaf.

01:13:07.868 --> 01:13:09.934
This very afternoon,
i was approached

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.532
With a sugar-Coated proposition,

01:13:11.567 --> 01:13:14.300
A bribe offered me
by this corrupt officialdom-

01:13:14.335 --> 01:13:16.518
$100,000 for the building
and equipment

01:13:16.553 --> 01:13:18.666
Of a recreation center
in my parish

01:13:18.701 --> 01:13:21.801
If i would agree to refrain
from further attacks,

01:13:21.836 --> 01:13:24.535
If i would sabotage
this campaign,

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:27.234
If i would
shut my eyes, stop my ears,

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:28.666
And hold my tongue.

01:13:28.701 --> 01:13:32.000
But building a playground
to shield my boys from crime

01:13:32.035 --> 01:13:34.332
Is not rooting out
the crime itself.

01:13:34.367 --> 01:13:37.033
We must rid ourselves
of the criminal parasites

01:13:37.068 --> 01:13:38.566
That feed on us.

01:13:38.601 --> 01:13:41.067
We must wipe out those
we have ignorantly elected

01:13:41.102 --> 01:13:43.534
And those who manipulate
this diseased officialdom

01:13:43.569 --> 01:13:44.899
Behind locked doors.

01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:48.834
Tonight, we have in our power
to ask definitely

01:13:48.869 --> 01:13:51.351
Incriminating questions
of these officials

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:53.834
And the power to demand
satisfactory answers.

01:13:53.869 --> 01:13:55.632
What really is the truth

01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:59.200
In the case of the racketeer
and gunman rocky sullivan?

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:01.418
Why did the police release him
so suddenly

01:14:01.453 --> 01:14:03.601
With all the evidence
they had against him?

01:14:03.636 --> 01:14:05.618
Why did the notorious
mac keefer

01:14:05.653 --> 01:14:07.566
Pay sullivan
$100,000 in cash,

01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:09.766
And what political sword
does he hold

01:14:09.801 --> 01:14:12.067
Over the trembling hands
of district attorneys,

01:14:12.102 --> 01:14:13.632
Judges,
and police officials?

01:14:13.667 --> 01:14:16.234
But tomorrow, the new
grand jury will meet,

01:14:16.269 --> 01:14:18.065
And these questions
must be answered.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.634
Therefore, i ask all of you
listening in...

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.868
You thought you
could buy him off?

01:14:22.903 --> 01:14:25.067
I told you you were
wastin' your time.

01:14:25.102 --> 01:14:26.668
We ain't wastin'
any more time.

01:14:26.703 --> 01:14:28.199
That was that guy's
last chance.

01:14:28.234 --> 01:14:29.900
We're gonna take care
of him tonight.

01:14:29.935 --> 01:14:32.034
Ah, you're talkin'
through your hat.

01:14:32.069 --> 01:14:34.133
You can't bump off
a priest. Forget it.

01:14:34.168 --> 01:14:35.917
I'll forget it
tomorrow morning

01:14:35.952 --> 01:14:37.667
When he's floating
down the river.

01:14:37.702 --> 01:14:39.065
Get this straight,
sullivan.

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.000
Even if he is
an old pal of yours,

01:14:42.035 --> 01:14:43.667
I'm still runnin'
the works.

01:14:43.702 --> 01:14:45.300
I'm not taking
orders from you

01:14:45.335 --> 01:14:46.399
All of a sudden.

01:14:46.434 --> 01:14:48.065
He's not gonna appear

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.100
At no grand jury tomorrow
shooting off his mouth.

01:14:51.135 --> 01:14:53.567
I say he
gets it tonight.

01:14:53.602 --> 01:14:55.399
Not if i'm around.

01:14:55.434 --> 01:14:57.034
Wait a minute,
gentlemen.

01:14:57.069 --> 01:14:58.584
There's no sense
in running

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:00.100
Too far ahead
of ourselves.

01:15:00.135 --> 01:15:01.165
Don't forget,

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.400
There are all kinds
of grand juries,

01:15:03.435 --> 01:15:04.601
And there's
all kinds of ways

01:15:04.636 --> 01:15:05.766
Of handling them.

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.851
That's what
you got me for.

01:15:07.886 --> 01:15:09.866
If you can do
a thing legally-

01:15:09.901 --> 01:15:12.701
Sure. I don't care
how we stop that guy,

01:15:12.736 --> 01:15:14.285
I only want him stopped.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.799
Then leave it to me.

01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:18.834
You know, this is
no penny ante reform wave

01:15:18.869 --> 01:15:20.451
This priest is starting.

01:15:20.486 --> 01:15:21.998
This is
a tidal wave,

01:15:22.033 --> 01:15:23.998
And unless
we stop it quick,

01:15:24.033 --> 01:15:26.516
We're gonna find
ourselves in the pen.

01:15:26.551 --> 01:15:29.000
Look, frazier, nobody
knows better than me

01:15:29.035 --> 01:15:30.632
That we're in a spot.
I know that.

01:15:30.667 --> 01:15:33.750
And, mac, you can settle
it any way you like.

01:15:33.785 --> 01:15:36.834
But lay off the rough
stuff, see? That's out.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.766
I'll see you later.

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.365
Frazier:
don't worry, mac.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.067
I've got an idea how we
can stymie that grand jury.

01:15:45.102 --> 01:15:47.334
That preacher won't
get to first base.

01:15:57.033 --> 01:15:59.850
I hope you were stalling.
I meant what i said.

01:15:59.885 --> 01:16:02.667
Sure. Connelly's,
first of all, rocky's pal.

01:16:02.702 --> 01:16:03.767
Second, he's a priest.

01:16:03.802 --> 01:16:04.732
So what?

01:16:04.767 --> 01:16:06.067
Where would rocky
keep those accounts?

01:16:06.102 --> 01:16:07.065
With that priest,

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.968
With instructions
to make 'em public

01:16:09.003 --> 01:16:10.534
If anything
happens to rocky.

01:16:10.569 --> 01:16:12.098
That ain't news
to me.

01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:14.666
That's why he
can be a wise guy.

01:16:14.701 --> 01:16:17.367
If we're gonna get
that preacher tonight,

01:16:17.402 --> 01:16:18.601
Why not get
those accounts, too?

01:16:18.636 --> 01:16:20.432
Yeah.

01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:23.367
Only this time,
no drugstore mistakes.

01:16:23.402 --> 01:16:25.568
I'm taking care
of this job myself.

01:16:25.603 --> 01:16:27.699
Get blackie up here
right away.

01:16:27.734 --> 01:16:30.000
I don't care how
you handle sullivan,

01:16:30.035 --> 01:16:32.267
But it's got to look
like an accident

01:16:32.302 --> 01:16:33.434
With that priest.

01:16:33.469 --> 01:16:34.567
Leave that to me.

01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:47.866
Rocky!

01:16:47.901 --> 01:16:50.866
Don't! Don't!
I'll do anything.

01:16:50.901 --> 01:16:53.365
No, you won't. You've
had your last chance.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.300
Take this with you-
I never let go of those papers.

01:16:56.335 --> 01:16:58.701
All you had to do
was bump me off.

01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:03.868
[Women screaming]

01:17:13.934 --> 01:17:15.300
[Women screaming]

01:17:30.033 --> 01:17:32.901
Come on, stand back.
We'll shoot it off.

01:17:40.901 --> 01:17:43.234
[Police whistle blowing]

01:17:43.269 --> 01:17:45.567
Gunfight
at the el toro.

01:18:12.767 --> 01:18:16.033
Is father connelly still there?
I must talk to him.

01:18:16.068 --> 01:18:18.501
[Sirens]

01:18:33.033 --> 01:18:35.067
[Sirens]

01:18:49.901 --> 01:18:51.032
Well?

01:18:51.067 --> 01:18:52.617
Rocky sullivan,
captain.

01:18:52.652 --> 01:18:54.132
He got frazier
and keefer.

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:56.432
They've chased him
up on the roof.

01:18:56.467 --> 01:18:58.734
Macmahon, throw a cordon
around the block.

01:18:58.769 --> 01:19:00.434
Come on, men,
with me.

01:19:02.534 --> 01:19:04.634
Here's the microphone,
captain.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.834
O'flannigan, hook up
those searchlights

01:19:07.869 --> 01:19:09.968
And play them
on the building.

01:19:13.968 --> 01:19:16.133
Galavan, cover
the warehouse skylights.

01:20:11.767 --> 01:20:13.667
[Coughing]

01:20:25.767 --> 01:20:27.200
There he is!

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.550
Sullivan, are you coming out,

01:20:46.585 --> 01:20:48.701
Or must we smoke you out?

01:20:53.901 --> 01:20:56.634
All right,
give him the tear gas.

01:21:16.601 --> 01:21:18.033
Please.

01:21:26.934 --> 01:21:29.934
Captain... i'm father connelly,
an old friend of rocky's.

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:31.501
He'll come out for me.
He'll listen to me.

01:21:31.536 --> 01:21:34.267
This is a job
for the police, father.

01:21:34.302 --> 01:21:36.666
He'll need
a priest later.

01:21:36.701 --> 01:21:39.000
You want to kill him,
or do you want him alive?

01:21:39.035 --> 01:21:41.000
What do you mean
by that?

01:21:41.035 --> 01:21:42.299
He'll listen to me.

01:21:42.334 --> 01:21:43.801
Won't you let me
talk to him?

01:21:43.836 --> 01:21:45.299
Go ahead.
Thank you.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:48.634
Rocky, this is jerry.
Please come out.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.299
Tell him we'll
get him anyway,

01:21:51.334 --> 01:21:53.868
Even if we blow up
the whole block.

01:21:53.903 --> 01:21:56.200
Rocky, you've
got to come out!

01:22:06.267 --> 01:22:08.200
I'm coming up.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.968
Officers,
hold your fire.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.868
Rocky?

01:23:12.434 --> 01:23:13.399
Rocky.

01:23:13.434 --> 01:23:14.732
What are you doin' up here?

01:23:14.767 --> 01:23:15.934
Go on. Get outta here!
Beat it!

01:23:15.969 --> 01:23:17.532
I'm coming in,
rocky.

01:23:17.567 --> 01:23:19.567
You want your skull
full of lead?

01:23:19.602 --> 01:23:20.933
Get outta here!

01:23:20.968 --> 01:23:23.801
I thought you were smarter
than to stick your kisser

01:23:23.836 --> 01:23:25.299
Into a place
like this.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.901
I couldn't watch them
shoot you down, rocky.

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.399
You're covered
from every angle.

01:23:29.434 --> 01:23:31.651
Your only chance
is to give yourself up.

01:23:31.686 --> 01:23:34.143
You're through, rocky.
You're finished.

01:23:34.178 --> 01:23:37.356
Yeah, i was until
you stepped into it.

01:23:37.391 --> 01:23:40.534
Father connelly,
are you all right?

01:23:40.569 --> 01:23:42.165
Go on.
Get over there

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.868
And tell them to
call off their dogs.

01:23:44.903 --> 01:23:46.501
I'm goin' down
with you.

01:23:46.536 --> 01:23:48.268
[Coughing]

01:23:48.303 --> 01:23:50.235
Sure, you are.

01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:52.167
[Coughing]

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.900
Call off your men,
all of them!

01:23:59.935 --> 01:24:02.884
Sullivan's coming out
with me!

01:24:02.919 --> 01:24:05.834
Hold your fire, men,
but stand by.

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:09.617
Let's go.

01:24:09.652 --> 01:24:11.400
[Coughing]

01:24:15.501 --> 01:24:18.034
Come on,
get 'em up, jerry.

01:24:18.069 --> 01:24:20.567
Sorry it has to
be you, kid,

01:24:20.602 --> 01:24:22.165
But get goin'.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.801
Get away from there,
or i'll let him have it!

01:24:25.836 --> 01:24:27.801
Turn back around.

01:24:29.901 --> 01:24:31.567
Come on.

01:24:51.267 --> 01:24:53.701
Get 'em up high. High!

01:25:02.901 --> 01:25:04.899
Get back,
all of you,

01:25:04.934 --> 01:25:07.434
Or i'll give it to him
right in the head!

01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:09.567
Back!

01:25:16.701 --> 01:25:18.467
Duck, jerry!

01:25:21.534 --> 01:25:24.701
[Gunfire]

01:25:31.334 --> 01:25:33.200
Got him
in the leg.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.232
Empty.

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:42.167
Heh heh. So is your
thick skull, copper.

01:25:43.734 --> 01:25:46.299
Extra! Identified killer!

01:25:46.334 --> 01:25:48.901
Papers! Get your papers!
Extra!

01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:51.100
Extra! Get your papers!

01:25:51.135 --> 01:25:52.934
Identified killer!

01:25:52.969 --> 01:25:54.699
Gee, that's tough.

01:25:54.734 --> 01:25:57.033
Boy, i'd like
to get my hands

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:58.466
On those squealers.

01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:02.734
"Special prosecutor
for trial of rocky today.

01:26:02.769 --> 01:26:05.265
State builds
strong case. "

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.234
That dope of a governor's
so scared of rocky,

01:26:08.269 --> 01:26:09.868
He's appointin'
a special shyster.

01:26:09.903 --> 01:26:13.699
"Rocky guilty;
to die!"

01:26:13.734 --> 01:26:15.734
Gee, you think
they'll burn him

01:26:15.769 --> 01:26:16.933
In the chair?

01:26:16.968 --> 01:26:18.868
Nah. They can't build
no death house

01:26:18.903 --> 01:26:20.265
That'll hold rocky.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.834
You mean he'll blow it
and make a getaway?

01:26:21.869 --> 01:26:23.899
Just wait, that's all.
Just wait.

01:26:23.934 --> 01:26:26.834
He'll show those mugs
how to die in a big way.

01:26:26.869 --> 01:26:29.734
Sure, he will. They'll
never make him crack.

01:26:29.769 --> 01:26:31.835
There's nothin' yellow
about rocky.

01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:33.901
Remember what he said
at the trial?

01:26:33.936 --> 01:26:35.599
Said he'd spit
in their eye.

01:26:35.634 --> 01:26:38.117
He'll do it, too.
He'll laugh at 'em.

01:26:38.152 --> 01:26:40.601
Sure, he'll show
those phonies up.

01:26:44.033 --> 01:26:45.534
Guard:
sullivan.

01:26:50.033 --> 01:26:51.365
Rocky.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.033
Father connelly has
received permission

01:26:53.068 --> 01:26:54.301
To be with you.

01:26:54.336 --> 01:26:55.499
He just arrived.

01:26:55.534 --> 01:26:57.165
You'll see him,
won't you?

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.799
Yeah, sure, send him in,
but tell him

01:26:58.834 --> 01:27:01.501
None of that incense
and holy water stuff,

01:27:01.536 --> 01:27:02.998
Will ya?

01:27:03.033 --> 01:27:04.701
Whatever you say,
rocky.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.634
Did you enjoy your
dinner, mr. Sullivan?

01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:15.965
Yeah, it was
pretty good,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.332
Only the meat
was kinda burnt,

01:27:17.367 --> 01:27:20.098
And i don't like
burnt meat. Do you?

01:27:20.133 --> 01:27:22.801
Listen, big shot, you got
only 10 minutes to go,

01:27:22.836 --> 01:27:24.318
So don't try stalling
around

01:27:24.353 --> 01:27:25.801
With that priest
pal of yours.

01:27:25.836 --> 01:27:27.365
[Spits]

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.333
10 minutes
till that hot seat.

01:27:29.368 --> 01:27:31.232
I'm gonna tell
the electrician

01:27:31.267 --> 01:27:34.367
To give it to you
slow and easy, wise guy.

01:27:34.402 --> 01:27:36.367
Somebody get this screw
out of here!

01:27:36.402 --> 01:27:38.667
Come on! Take him
out of there!

01:27:38.702 --> 01:27:40.300
Get him out
of there!

01:27:40.335 --> 01:27:42.933
[Inmates yelling]

01:27:42.968 --> 01:27:45.033
Let him alone,
herbert.

01:27:45.068 --> 01:27:46.567
Quiet.

01:27:46.602 --> 01:27:48.032
Hey!

01:27:48.067 --> 01:27:50.133
Quiet, now!
Quiet.

01:27:51.267 --> 01:27:52.834
How are you,
father?

01:27:52.869 --> 01:27:54.484
How much time?

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.100
About 10 minutes.

01:28:02.534 --> 01:28:03.998
Hiya, jerry.

01:28:04.033 --> 01:28:05.867
Whaddya hear?
Whaddya say?

01:28:05.902 --> 01:28:07.701
Hello, rocky.
How do you feel?

01:28:07.736 --> 01:28:09.567
Like a million.

01:28:09.602 --> 01:28:12.065
Uh...

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.450
How is soapy
and the kids?

01:28:13.485 --> 01:28:14.766
Pulling for you
all the way.

01:28:14.801 --> 01:28:16.067
As long as there's
the slightest hope

01:28:16.102 --> 01:28:17.032
From the governor.

01:28:17.067 --> 01:28:18.567
They'll be easier
to handle with me

01:28:18.602 --> 01:28:20.101
Out of the way,
won't they?

01:28:20.136 --> 01:28:21.601
That's up to you,
rocky.

01:28:21.636 --> 01:28:22.601
Huh?

01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:26.167
We haven't got
a lot of time.

01:28:26.202 --> 01:28:28.018
I want to ask
one last favor.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.834
There's not much
i can do, kid.

01:28:29.869 --> 01:28:31.232
Yes, there is,
rocky-

01:28:31.267 --> 01:28:32.667
Perhaps more than
you could do

01:28:32.702 --> 01:28:34.032
Under any
other circumstances,

01:28:34.067 --> 01:28:37.067
If you have the courage,
and i know you have.

01:28:37.102 --> 01:28:38.434
You mean
walkin' in there?

01:28:38.469 --> 01:28:39.767
That's not
gonna take much.

01:28:39.802 --> 01:28:41.332
I know that, rocky.

01:28:41.367 --> 01:28:43.250
It's like sittin'
a barber chair.

01:28:43.285 --> 01:28:44.776
They're gonna ask,
"anything to say?"

01:28:44.811 --> 01:28:46.232
I'll say, "give me
a haircut, a shave

01:28:46.267 --> 01:28:48.300
And one of those nice
new electric massages. "

01:28:48.335 --> 01:28:50.084
But you're
not afraid, rocky?

01:28:50.119 --> 01:28:51.759
No. They'd
like me to be.

01:28:51.794 --> 01:28:53.365
I can't
oblige 'em, kid.

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.933
You know, jerry,
i think to be afraid,

01:28:55.968 --> 01:28:58.000
You got to have a heart.
I don't think i got one.

01:28:58.035 --> 01:29:00.884
I had that cut out of me
a long time ago.

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:03.734
Suppose i asked you
to have the heart,

01:29:03.769 --> 01:29:05.285
To be scared?

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.766
What do you mean?

01:29:06.801 --> 01:29:08.801
Suppose the guards
dragged you out

01:29:08.836 --> 01:29:09.766
Screaming for mercy?

01:29:09.801 --> 01:29:12.032
Suppose you went
to the chair yellow?

01:29:12.067 --> 01:29:14.734
Yellow? Say, what's
the matter with you, jerry?

01:29:14.769 --> 01:29:16.968
You just been worryin'
about my courage.

01:29:17.003 --> 01:29:18.466
I know that.

01:29:18.501 --> 01:29:20.801
This is a different
kind of courage...

01:29:20.836 --> 01:29:22.232
The kind that's...

01:29:22.267 --> 01:29:24.098
Well, it's born
in heaven.

01:29:24.133 --> 01:29:26.917
Not the courage of
heroics and bravado,

01:29:26.952 --> 01:29:29.701
The kind that you and i
and god know about.

01:29:29.736 --> 01:29:32.101
I still don't know
what you mean.

01:29:32.136 --> 01:29:34.552
Look, rocky, before
i came up here,

01:29:34.587 --> 01:29:36.694
The boys saw me off
on the train,

01:29:36.729 --> 01:29:38.831
Soapy and several
of the others.

01:29:38.866 --> 01:29:41.083
You can imagine
what they told me.

01:29:41.118 --> 01:29:43.300
"Father, tell rocky
to show the world

01:29:43.335 --> 01:29:44.532
"What he's made of.

01:29:44.567 --> 01:29:46.517
"Tell him not
to be afraid,

01:29:46.552 --> 01:29:48.467
To go out
laughing and-"

01:29:48.502 --> 01:29:49.799
What do you want?

01:29:49.834 --> 01:29:51.784
I'm not gonna
let them down,

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:53.926
If that's what's
worryin' you.

01:29:53.961 --> 01:29:56.147
I want you
to let them down.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:58.299
You've been a hero
to these kids

01:29:58.334 --> 01:30:00.634
And hundreds of others
all through your life.

01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:02.265
Now you're gonna be

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.866
A glorified hero
in death,

01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:06.000
And i want to
prevent that, rocky.

01:30:06.035 --> 01:30:08.151
They've got to
despise your memory.

01:30:08.186 --> 01:30:10.232
They've got to be
ashamed of you.

01:30:10.267 --> 01:30:12.367
You're askin' me
to pull an act, turn yellow,

01:30:12.402 --> 01:30:14.467
So those kids
will think i'm no good?

01:30:14.502 --> 01:30:16.000
You're askin' me
to throw away

01:30:16.035 --> 01:30:17.466
The only thing i got left,

01:30:17.501 --> 01:30:18.667
The only thing they haven't
been able to take away from me,

01:30:18.702 --> 01:30:19.965
To give those newspaper
sob sisters

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.467
A chance to say,
"another rat turned yellow. "

01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:24.365
You and i will
know you're not.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.767
You're askin' me
to crawl on my belly

01:30:26.802 --> 01:30:28.701
The last thing
i do in life.

01:30:28.736 --> 01:30:30.267
I know
what i'm asking,

01:30:30.302 --> 01:30:31.232
And i'm asking

01:30:31.267 --> 01:30:32.466
Because being
kids together

01:30:32.501 --> 01:30:35.100
Gave me the idea
that you might like

01:30:35.135 --> 01:30:36.632
To join hands
with me

01:30:36.667 --> 01:30:39.599
And save some other boys
from ending up here.

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:41.601
You're asking too much.
You want to help those kids,

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.268
Figure out
some other way!

01:30:43.303 --> 01:30:44.768
It's impossible
to do it

01:30:44.803 --> 01:30:46.199
Without your help,
rocky.

01:30:46.234 --> 01:30:48.499
I can't reach
all of those boys,

01:30:48.534 --> 01:30:50.834
Hero-Worshiping kids
all over the country.

01:30:50.869 --> 01:30:52.368
Don't give me
that humanity stuff.

01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:53.833
I had enough
in the courtroom.

01:30:53.868 --> 01:30:55.332
Told everything i knew.
Named names,

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:56.567
Gave the lowdown
on the whole dirty mess.

01:30:56.602 --> 01:30:57.632
What more do you want?

01:30:57.667 --> 01:31:00.033
What i've always
wanted, rocky-

01:31:00.068 --> 01:31:02.400
Straighten yourself
out with god.

01:31:04.067 --> 01:31:05.532
Outside of that,

01:31:05.567 --> 01:31:07.567
I can't ask
for anything else.

01:31:07.602 --> 01:31:09.267
Well, don't!

01:31:16.501 --> 01:31:18.901
It's time, rocky.
Are you ready?

01:31:18.936 --> 01:31:20.534
Yeah.

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.400
You figure on
goin' in with me?

01:31:25.435 --> 01:31:27.666
I'd like to, rocky,
that is, if-

01:31:27.701 --> 01:31:30.667
You can if you wish.
Do you mind, father?

01:31:30.702 --> 01:31:32.134
Certainly not.

01:31:32.169 --> 01:31:33.532
That's better.

01:31:33.567 --> 01:31:36.467
Be kind of lonesome
goin' down that last mile.

01:31:37.734 --> 01:31:39.766
Oh, uh, promise me
somethin'.

01:31:39.801 --> 01:31:42.801
Promise me you won't
let me hear you pray.

01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:44.868
I promise
you won't hear me.

01:31:48.267 --> 01:31:50.000
Get away from me, screw,

01:31:50.035 --> 01:31:51.699
Or i'll bust
your face in.

01:31:51.734 --> 01:31:53.234
It'll be the last face
you see, big shot,

01:31:53.269 --> 01:31:54.467
And it'll be
laughing at you.

01:31:54.502 --> 01:31:55.965
Don't get
near me now.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.100
I'll spit
in your eye again.

01:31:58.135 --> 01:32:00.065
Herbert,
stand back.

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:02.200
Thompson,
take care of him.

01:32:03.868 --> 01:32:06.267
Lay off. I don't
need anybody.

01:32:06.302 --> 01:32:08.232
Come on.

01:32:08.267 --> 01:32:09.950
Inmate:
that-A-Boy, rocky.

01:32:09.985 --> 01:32:11.599
Pick your own
company.

01:32:11.634 --> 01:32:15.100
So long, rocky.
We won't be long.

01:32:15.135 --> 01:32:16.834
So long, rocky.

01:32:57.634 --> 01:32:59.567
Rocky, please.

01:32:59.602 --> 01:33:01.234
No.

01:33:16.834 --> 01:33:18.550
So long, kid.

01:33:18.585 --> 01:33:20.232
Good-Bye, rocky.

01:33:20.267 --> 01:33:22.601
May god
have mercy on you.

01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:45.400
Oh, i don't want to die!
Oh, please!

01:33:45.435 --> 01:33:47.267
[Sobbing]
i don't want to die!

01:33:47.302 --> 01:33:49.232
Oh, please! Please!

01:33:49.267 --> 01:33:52.934
Ah, don't make me burn
in hell!

01:33:52.969 --> 01:33:54.199
[Gasp]

01:33:54.234 --> 01:33:56.817
Oh, please, let go of me!

01:33:56.852 --> 01:33:59.942
Please, don't kill me!

01:33:59.977 --> 01:34:03.033
Oh, don't kill me, please!

01:34:03.068 --> 01:34:04.567
[Sobbing]

01:34:11.467 --> 01:34:13.334
Man: ok, hold him
down there!

01:34:13.369 --> 01:34:14.732
[Sobbing] no!

01:34:14.767 --> 01:34:15.901
Please, don't kill me!

01:34:15.936 --> 01:34:16.934
Ohh-

01:34:25.534 --> 01:34:29.300
The yellow rat was
gonna spit in my eye.

01:34:36.634 --> 01:34:39.601
"At the fatal stroke
of 11 p. M.,

01:34:39.636 --> 01:34:40.866
"Rocky was led

01:34:40.901 --> 01:34:43.117
"Through the little
green door of death.

01:34:43.152 --> 01:34:45.793
"No sooner had he entered
the death chamber

01:34:45.828 --> 01:34:48.434
"Than he tore himself
from the guards' grasp,

01:34:48.469 --> 01:34:49.901
"Flung himself
on the floor

01:34:49.936 --> 01:34:51.232
"Screaming for mercy.

01:34:51.267 --> 01:34:54.467
"And as they dragged him
to the electric chair,

01:34:54.502 --> 01:34:56.901
"He crawled around
on the concrete floor

01:34:56.936 --> 01:34:58.299
"With agonized shrieks.

01:34:58.334 --> 01:35:01.467
In contrast to
his former heroics... "

01:35:03.467 --> 01:35:06.067
"Rocky sullivan
died a coward. "

01:35:07.801 --> 01:35:08.933
I don't believe it.

01:35:08.968 --> 01:35:11.767
I don't believe
one rotten word of it.

01:35:11.802 --> 01:35:14.332
I don't believe it, either.

01:35:14.367 --> 01:35:16.084
If anybody says
it's true, i'll...

01:35:16.119 --> 01:35:17.801
He couldn't die
that way, not rocky!

01:35:17.836 --> 01:35:19.098
He couldn't!

01:35:19.133 --> 01:35:21.634
It's all lies!
Lies, i tell ya!

01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:22.766
Hey, fellas.

01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:25.299

He oughta know.

01:35:27.536 --> 01:35:29.501
He'll tell us

01:35:37.334 --> 01:35:39.667
You were there,
father.

01:35:39.702 --> 01:35:41.667
You saw everything.

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.799
What happened?

01:35:43.834 --> 01:35:46.801
Did rocky die
like they said,

01:35:46.836 --> 01:35:48.767
Like
a yellow rat?

01:35:52.834 --> 01:35:57.033
It's true, boys.
Every word of it.

01:35:57.068 --> 01:35:58.934
He died like they said.

01:36:02.701 --> 01:36:04.701
All right, fellas.

01:36:04.736 --> 01:36:06.666
