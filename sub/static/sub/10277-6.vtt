WEBVTT

00:05.079 --> 00:06.557
Previously on E.R.

00:06.558 --> 00:09.134
You're taking drugs, which means
your baby is taking drugs.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.164
I'm hardly using.

00:10.165 --> 00:11.962
You can't use at all!

00:11.963 --> 00:14.002
Is it Ok that I might be
a little late tomorrow?

00:14.003 --> 00:16.504
You don't like that I hired Gabe,
but I did, so deal with it.

00:16.579 --> 00:19.841
These are unreliable. Half the time
you end up in the preperitoneal space.

00:19.842 --> 00:22.128
- I think if you tried-
- I said no, damn it!

00:22.329 --> 00:24.006
This is crap!

00:26.320 --> 00:29.463
6x06 "THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS"

00:34.995 --> 00:38.245
- Can I give you a hand with that?
- Thanks.

00:38.457 --> 00:40.948
It cost a fortune and it's stuck.

00:41.168 --> 00:45.461
As long as I can sneak under it.
I left mine at home.

00:45.672 --> 00:49.621
I hate coming in to work
when it's still dark.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.502
Doesn't look promising.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.840
Perfect start to a perfect day!

00:56.057 --> 00:58.464
93-year-old woman with COPD.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.638
Wheezing due to smoke inhalation.
No facial-burn evidence.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.769
BP's 134 over 92, pulse 96.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.184
Get her on a pulse ox.
Order a chest film.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.236
- What's up?
- Fire in a nursing home.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.530
Not enough people to get them out.
Get this last ambulance.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.527
90-year-old with tachypnea,
altered mental status.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.115
- BP's 95 over 60.
- No singed nasal hairs.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.998
We're getting two more, one critical.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.749
- Who's on the desk?
- Nobody.

01:23.958 --> 01:27.659
- Steve's sick, Randi left at 6:30.
- She didn't wait for a replacement?

01:27.837 --> 01:29.995
You want to bitch, bitch at her.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.833
Haleh, I need you.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.507
Jeanie called.
She's not coming in either.

01:37.972 --> 01:40.213
You got basketball practice?

01:40.432 --> 01:43.433
- I have practice.
- You about ready?

01:43.644 --> 01:45.186
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:45.354 --> 01:49.186
Your backpack's in the bathroom
atop the toilet.

01:49.358 --> 01:51.350
Your basketball stuff's
in the basement.

01:51.526 --> 01:54.017
If you want it washed,
put it in the basket.

01:54.237 --> 01:59.029
She can hit a 20-foot fader
but she can't hit the hamper.

02:01.703 --> 02:04.110
- Got a minute?
- Not really.

02:08.918 --> 02:11.919
Carla says Reece might not be mine.

02:13.422 --> 02:15.082
What are you gonna do?

02:16.884 --> 02:21.546
I don't know that I believe her
with everything going on.

02:22.181 --> 02:25.715
What the hell's the matter
with that bitch?

02:25.892 --> 02:30.139
All that she's put you through
and she's not even sure?

02:32.774 --> 02:34.102
I'm sorry.

02:34.901 --> 02:38.851
Has she always known this or
is she doing it to get Reece?

02:40.073 --> 02:43.655
I got a paternity test.
I haven't taken it.

02:43.868 --> 02:46.822
- How long does it take?
- I don't know if I'll take it.

02:47.246 --> 02:48.277
You have to.

02:49.331 --> 02:51.407
What if I'm not his dad?

02:52.668 --> 02:55.159
You can't wait. He'll find out.

02:55.379 --> 02:59.079
- I know-
- Then he'll know you lied to him.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:02.776 --> 04:06.608
- What's up?
- I called, but the phone just rang.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.781
I don't always hear it.
I gotta go to work.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.485
- Still at the pharmacy?
- The hours are good.

04:13.704 --> 04:16.111
The tests came after you left.

04:16.331 --> 04:19.949
You gotta get treated for
a bladder infection.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.913
It can be dangerous
when you're pregnant.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.707
I'll come by soon.

04:24.923 --> 04:29.631
Have you given any more thought
to the detox program?

04:29.844 --> 04:32.798
I stopped using five days ago.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.641
- Good for you.
- Thanks again.

04:37.601 --> 04:41.551
I don't give a damn how many
patients you have!

04:41.772 --> 04:45.520
We're drowning here.
I need qualified bodies.

04:45.734 --> 04:48.106
- Excuse me, I'm-
- Go away.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.195
I've got 11 fried old folks.
Want to compare patient loads?

04:53.408 --> 04:57.192
You're in a car accident,
I hope you end up here.

04:57.412 --> 05:02.204
I'll personally be of absolutely
no help to you whatsoever!

05:02.417 --> 05:03.959
- Twerp.
- Excuse me.

05:04.168 --> 05:08.000
- I'm Andrew-
- You have an M.D. behind your name?

05:08.214 --> 05:13.172
Have a seat. I'll get to you
when I get to you.

05:13.427 --> 05:16.428
- Margaret Ramey sent me.
- You a desk clerk?

05:16.639 --> 05:20.303
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good. Then get back here now.

05:22.811 --> 05:25.682
- Okay, so-
- You're a clerk. Clerk.

05:25.897 --> 05:28.139
Phone anybody with the day off.

05:28.358 --> 05:31.561
They'll work today if they
want to work here tomorrow.

05:32.028 --> 05:33.570
- Oh, God!
- Can I help you?

05:33.738 --> 05:36.027
I've lost my husband.

05:36.241 --> 05:39.194
- Were you in the fire?
- Barry's his name.

05:39.410 --> 05:43.704
I followed them down the hall.
They went so fast.

05:43.915 --> 05:47.414
Let's go see if we can find him
for you.

05:47.626 --> 05:48.871
Thank you.

05:49.044 --> 05:53.208
- Take a deep breath.
- Pulse ox 82 on four liters.

05:53.424 --> 05:56.377
Can your patient's wife come in?

05:56.593 --> 05:59.927
- Absolutely. You free?
- I was gonna grab another one.

06:00.138 --> 06:03.590
Take this one.
No singed nasal hairs.

06:03.809 --> 06:05.468
Barry, I'm here.

06:05.685 --> 06:07.892
I need you to lean forward.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.518
He can't lift himself.

06:14.444 --> 06:17.895
Wet crackles bilaterally.
Put him on a non-rebreather.

06:18.072 --> 06:22.401
- MS, CHF, coronary artery disease.
- Let's get a nitre drip.

06:22.576 --> 06:27.487
Titrate to a systolic of 100.
80 of Lasix, four of morphine.

06:27.706 --> 06:29.865
- You got it?
- Yeah.

06:31.627 --> 06:34.912
78-year-old woman,
right thigh contusion.

06:35.088 --> 06:37.128
BP's 155 over 88, pulse 96.

06:37.340 --> 06:39.167
Laceration to forehead.

06:39.384 --> 06:41.258
I should've had that coffee.

06:41.428 --> 06:43.254
- What is it?
- Nursing-home fire.

06:43.430 --> 06:45.469
Check the residents.

06:45.682 --> 06:49.596
Can you take over the desk?
They're stacking up.

06:50.144 --> 06:53.596
No smoke inhalation sign,
but she's hypoxic.

06:53.773 --> 06:57.687
- Pulse ox is down to 84.
- Crank her up to 10.

06:57.902 --> 07:02.148
- What is it? Her chest's clear.
- Should I get Dr. Greene?

07:02.656 --> 07:05.443
- What's her temp?
-101.2.

07:06.452 --> 07:10.235
You appreciate the coarse rhonchi
at the right base?

07:14.918 --> 07:17.539
- She has pneumonia.
- Not much gets by you.

07:17.754 --> 07:21.882
- CBC, blood cultures-
- Chest x-ray, ceftriaxone. Sign.

07:23.134 --> 07:26.301
Andy does imitations. Ask him.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.841
Imitations, huh?

07:28.055 --> 07:30.926
I'm better at improv.
This is my day job.

07:31.142 --> 07:35.554
Do Keanu Reeves, man. Come on.
Do something, man.

07:37.147 --> 07:41.359
Whoa! You're a little pregnant, huh?
All right.

07:41.568 --> 07:44.238
- Picked a name for the dude?
- No.

07:44.446 --> 07:47.815
How about Leif? Or Bodhi? Or Keanu?

07:48.909 --> 07:52.657
- Keanu's a most excellent name.
- Very good.

07:52.829 --> 07:56.032
- Did you talk to Jeanie?
- She can't make it.

07:56.249 --> 07:58.206
She's been out all week.

07:58.418 --> 08:02.961
Call her and have her tell me
why I shouldn't fire her.

08:04.298 --> 08:06.291
Just had a great pickup.

08:06.509 --> 08:10.257
Woman had rapid breathing
and altered mental status.

08:10.471 --> 08:13.341
Tachypneic, hypoxic.
Like smoke inhalation.

08:13.516 --> 08:17.595
- Your Bunsen burner's still on.
- Pulse ox 84. You with me?

08:17.811 --> 08:19.685
Struggling. I think I get it.

08:19.897 --> 08:24.060
I could've thought inhalation,
but I saw subtleties.

08:24.276 --> 08:28.225
Crackles in the middle lobe
and low-grade fever.

08:28.446 --> 08:29.822
Pneumonia.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.229
Right.

08:32.325 --> 08:34.780
Figure I'll find gram-positive
diplococci here.

08:34.994 --> 08:38.446
- She's lucky she had you.
- Damn straight!

08:38.664 --> 08:42.365
Haleh said she heard the rhonchi
and told you.

08:47.840 --> 08:52.134
- I can't understand him.
- He can't get enough oxygen.

08:52.344 --> 08:57.255
Causes confusion and disorientation.
His lungs are very sick.

08:57.641 --> 09:01.935
We have to place a tube
down his throat to help him breathe.

09:02.145 --> 09:07.056
- I don't know that that will help.
- Will he get better?

09:08.610 --> 09:12.477
There is a chance.
In his declining health...

09:12.697 --> 09:16.397
- ... I'm not optimistic.
- He could get better?

09:17.285 --> 09:18.364
He could.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.491
Then let's try it.

09:23.999 --> 09:26.490
It could also be his heart.

09:29.254 --> 09:31.211
We'll run more tests...

09:31.423 --> 09:34.673
...to ensure we're doing
the right thing.

09:36.303 --> 09:40.965
- Can we get Cardiology down here?
- To do an echo?

09:46.813 --> 09:47.844
Help me!

09:48.022 --> 09:50.940
- How you doing?
-89-year-old woman.

09:51.150 --> 09:54.400
Delusional, no smoke inhalation
or injury.

09:54.612 --> 09:58.194
- What's been done?
- Five of Haldol, two of Ativan.

09:58.407 --> 10:01.858
- I lost my reading glasses.
- Help me! Why won't you help?

10:03.037 --> 10:05.907
- Please!
- Dementia cases are so sad.

10:06.123 --> 10:09.741
I hated Geriatrics rotation,
so I chose Pedes.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.498
Looks like you're doing fine.

10:20.970 --> 10:24.635
- How's she doing?
- Fine. Excuse me.

10:26.976 --> 10:28.719
Three are in Medicine.

10:28.936 --> 10:32.471
The broken hip's in surgery,
one's in CICU.

10:32.648 --> 10:35.139
Five were treated and released.

10:35.359 --> 10:36.984
- You smell gas?
- I do.

10:37.194 --> 10:38.854
- Smell that?
- Yeah.

10:39.071 --> 10:43.982
I'll call Maintenance.
Get everyone out of this hall.

10:44.826 --> 10:46.237
It's stronger in here-

10:59.549 --> 11:02.752
Both eardrums intact.
How's the ringing?

11:02.969 --> 11:05.045
- Still bad?
- What was it?

11:05.263 --> 11:08.050
A Bunsen burner may have been left on.

11:08.265 --> 11:11.183
I used one. I'm sure I turned it off.

11:11.393 --> 11:16.351
- Want to go to Audiology?
- I had it worse at a Clash concert.

11:16.523 --> 11:20.307
- I want out of these wet clothes.
- Just scratches.

11:20.527 --> 11:24.026
- Could today get any worse?
- What happened?

11:24.239 --> 11:28.402
We think a small gas leak
may have ignited next door.

11:28.618 --> 11:33.114
- I heard it on the 4th floor.
- No one's seriously injured.

11:33.331 --> 11:37.957
- A Bunsen burner may have been left on.
- Really?

11:38.169 --> 11:40.921
- The pain started when?
- Last night.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.882
- Had you eaten?
- We shared a pizza.

11:44.050 --> 11:46.042
- Any vomiting?
- No.

11:46.260 --> 11:49.427
- Any pain?
- A bit near my bellybutton.

11:49.638 --> 11:51.263
- How old are you?
-12.

11:51.473 --> 11:54.143
Married? Big for your age.
Play football?

11:54.351 --> 11:57.103
He's into video games, not sports.

11:57.312 --> 12:00.515
- Sit up. Any pain back here?
- A little.

12:00.732 --> 12:05.275
- Dr. Kayson's here.
- Thanks. I'll be right there.

12:05.487 --> 12:09.105
It's not too serious.
Maybe a stomach flu.

12:09.324 --> 12:12.574
Pee in the cup and give it to Malik.

12:13.119 --> 12:16.570
- Pistachio, almond and peppermint.
- Peppermint?

12:16.747 --> 12:18.621
Just eat the pistachio.

12:18.833 --> 12:23.245
Another birthday? Just leave
the decorations up permanently.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.876
Carol's surprise baby shower.

12:26.090 --> 12:29.755
Anybody leave their reading glasses
in the freezer?

12:29.968 --> 12:31.083
May I see those?

12:31.303 --> 12:34.304
I've left mine in some weird places.

12:34.514 --> 12:39.425
- Are they yours?
- No, but I think I know whose they are.

12:40.437 --> 12:42.928
- You got a minute?
- Wish I had.

12:43.106 --> 12:46.557
- We can talk while I work.
- Nice office.

12:46.776 --> 12:51.354
His madness is admirable,
no matter how sociopathic.

12:51.572 --> 12:54.443
- Who?
- Romano. This office. Sorry.

12:54.659 --> 12:56.236
You wanted to talk?

12:56.952 --> 13:01.116
Slumming with we simple surgical folk,
Dr. Benton?

13:01.665 --> 13:03.492
We're discussing a patient.

13:03.792 --> 13:08.371
Not taking him from the excitement
of trauma medicine, I hope.

13:08.797 --> 13:12.380
I have a hernia scheduled.

13:12.551 --> 13:15.124
I'm meeting the insurance people.

13:15.345 --> 13:18.299
Can you do it?
It's a bit early. 6:00.

13:18.473 --> 13:21.972
- In the morning?
- Early bird catches the worm.

13:22.185 --> 13:25.969
A more advanced ER member
blew up the lab.

13:26.189 --> 13:30.020
- The insurance company's concerned.
- Anyone hurt?

13:30.234 --> 13:35.145
Your boyfriend's hair got mussed,
but he bounced right back.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.321
He is a scrapper.

13:37.491 --> 13:41.323
Deaf as a post, but that's
probably temporary.

13:43.830 --> 13:46.500
What would you pay for my sperm?

13:46.750 --> 13:51.412
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, is that sexual harassment?

13:51.630 --> 13:56.422
Oh, no, The Marshall/Hillberg
Sperm Bank recruited me.

13:56.634 --> 14:00.963
Its donors include Olympic athletes
and Nobel winners.

14:01.472 --> 14:06.264
- They want you?
- Embarrassing, but it's a good cause.

14:06.477 --> 14:11.103
Who knows what the mother brings?
As for my genetics...

14:11.315 --> 14:15.728
...I guarantee a great advantage
over the spermic competition.

14:15.903 --> 14:19.817
Can't have too many Romanos
running around, can we?

14:31.960 --> 14:34.581
- What've we got?
- Shattered femur. Rock-climbing.

14:34.754 --> 14:38.039
55-year-old keeping up
with a young wife.

14:38.257 --> 14:39.965
What a mess!

14:40.343 --> 14:43.925
Major orthopedic surgery,
four months in a wheelchair.

14:44.138 --> 14:46.593
Should prove his vitality
to the fairer sex.

14:47.433 --> 14:50.137
Still looking for
your reading glasses?

14:50.352 --> 14:53.436
I'll stop by a drugstore
for a $10 pair.

14:53.647 --> 14:54.810
Are these them?

14:56.316 --> 14:57.597
Where were they?

14:58.110 --> 15:00.779
In the freezer in the lounge.

15:01.112 --> 15:04.066
That's one place I didn't look.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.400
Thanks.

15:12.290 --> 15:15.125
Could you write a Keflex prescription?

15:15.334 --> 15:18.039
A sometimes patient,
8 months pregnant.

15:18.254 --> 15:20.579
She has a bladder infection.

15:20.798 --> 15:23.834
- Want me to see her?
- She's not here.

15:24.009 --> 15:28.338
I'll get it for her
and hope she fills it.

15:29.598 --> 15:30.796
Thank you.

15:35.687 --> 15:40.598
I think the heart failure's making
him sick. Not his lungs.

15:43.194 --> 15:45.519
I think we need to accept...

15:45.697 --> 15:50.109
...that the time has come
to let nature take its course.

15:51.619 --> 15:54.240
I don't know what to do.

15:55.790 --> 16:00.582
Barry always made all the
important decisions.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.497
You know what a "Do Not Resuscitate"
order is?

16:08.260 --> 16:11.047
I think you need to sign one for him.

16:13.557 --> 16:15.300
Will you do that?

16:18.019 --> 16:19.679
Yes.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.689
Dr. Spielman's office?

16:28.904 --> 16:32.320
Third floor. Go left
past the MRl suite.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.454
- Dr. Spielman.
- Kerry! My God! How are you?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.288
I'm fine, thanks.

16:40.499 --> 16:44.579
Still sacrificing yourself
to the indigent at County?

16:44.753 --> 16:48.122
- Battling windmills.
- Please. Want some tea?

16:48.340 --> 16:52.800
No, thanks. You moved the office
around a little bit.

16:53.011 --> 16:56.510
Yeah, when we put in the MRl suite,
what a mess!

16:56.723 --> 16:59.926
What brings you here?
Job-hunting, I hope.

17:01.436 --> 17:03.095
No, Gabe Lawrence.

17:05.106 --> 17:09.933
- You let him go a couple months ago?
- He left the staff, yes.

17:10.986 --> 17:15.114
I heard it was politics.
A bit of a palace coup.

17:15.949 --> 17:19.401
With me cast as lago, I suspect.

17:19.619 --> 17:22.490
I wonder if that really happened.

17:22.705 --> 17:27.617
Gabe Lawrence was my closest friend.
My mentor, my teacher.

17:27.836 --> 17:31.169
The finest doctor
I've ever worked with.

17:31.589 --> 17:36.465
His leaving was the most trying
experience of my career.

17:36.636 --> 17:38.842
I hired him at County.

17:40.723 --> 17:42.846
I hadn't heard that.

17:43.142 --> 17:44.601
I need to know.

17:44.810 --> 17:49.721
Should I worry about patient safety
with him on my staff?

17:56.655 --> 17:59.062
- Where's Dr. Lawrence?
- Trauma 2.

17:59.282 --> 18:01.987
- What have they got?
- Stab wound to the chest.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.449
Rib spreader.

18:06.247 --> 18:07.907
- Suction.
- Still no pulse.

18:11.002 --> 18:14.750
- Need a hand?
- We're fine. Too many cooks...

18:15.298 --> 18:17.919
- Heart's still beating.
- Not much blood.

18:18.134 --> 18:20.422
Pulseless electrical activity.

18:20.636 --> 18:24.680
Four units of O-neg.
Stab wound, left ventricle.

18:24.848 --> 18:29.427
- Hold this. Do you sew fast?
- Blink and you'll miss it.

18:29.645 --> 18:33.428
I'll put him into
ventricular fibrillation.

18:33.648 --> 18:36.222
- Are you serious?
- Do you want to sew a moving target?

18:36.443 --> 18:39.064
- What next?
- Sauerbruch grip.

18:39.279 --> 18:43.359
Dr. Weaver was the finest student
I ever had.

18:43.533 --> 18:46.202
She answered before I questioned.

18:46.744 --> 18:49.413
And what is the Sauerbruch grip?

18:49.622 --> 18:52.623
Occlude the inflow
from both vena cava.

18:53.292 --> 18:54.703
What'd I tell you?

18:54.919 --> 18:57.244
You'll have 30 seconds to fix it.

18:57.463 --> 19:00.796
- Go high, with a horizontal mattress.
- V-fib.

19:17.065 --> 19:19.520
Charge the paddles to 20.

19:19.734 --> 19:22.059
Don't tie that too tight.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.906
- Paddles now.
- Last knot.

19:30.745 --> 19:32.702
Look at the heart.

19:32.872 --> 19:36.869
That is normal sinus rhythm
inside the chest.

19:37.084 --> 19:38.115
Damn!

19:42.506 --> 19:46.124
- She was the last one to use it.
- They'd fire her?

19:46.343 --> 19:49.260
- Who?
- Dr. Finch last used the Bunsen.

19:49.429 --> 19:50.460
Fired? For that?

19:50.638 --> 19:54.138
If you can be fired for dress-code
violations, you can be for this.

19:54.350 --> 19:56.142
Dress-code violations?

19:56.352 --> 19:57.930
Is anything open?

19:58.146 --> 20:00.637
Do Christopher Walken.

20:00.857 --> 20:03.478
Well, see, you want a room?

20:03.693 --> 20:08.520
The only room that's available
is Exam 1.

20:08.739 --> 20:10.067
Thanks.

20:10.241 --> 20:13.241
Welcome. Have fun
storming the castle.

20:28.925 --> 20:30.300
Here you go.

20:31.302 --> 20:32.381
Sit up.

20:34.097 --> 20:37.216
Let's get this DNA stuff over with.

20:48.152 --> 20:49.183
See?

21:03.416 --> 21:05.575
See, that didn't hurt.

21:06.502 --> 21:08.542
All right. Yeah.

21:19.181 --> 21:22.265
Good man. That's my big man.

21:33.487 --> 21:35.278
I'm sorry.

21:49.168 --> 21:50.876
Is Meg Corwin here?

21:51.087 --> 21:53.412
- Deb, where's Meg?
- On break.

21:53.631 --> 21:57.047
Probably out back.
Past the bathrooms.

21:57.259 --> 21:58.290
Thank you.

22:04.474 --> 22:06.882
I get paid today, really.

22:07.102 --> 22:10.268
- I'll catch you later?
- I'm off at 6:30.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.511
Maybe.

22:13.858 --> 22:14.890
What are you doing here?

22:15.068 --> 22:19.611
I brought you your prescription.
Who was that guy?

22:19.822 --> 22:21.945
Oh, Meg, you're pregnant.

22:22.617 --> 22:25.487
No kidding. I didn't ask to be.

22:25.703 --> 22:29.072
- You weren't there?
- It's none of your business.

22:29.248 --> 22:32.118
Your kid deserves a chance to live.

22:32.334 --> 22:35.288
You've mixed me up with
someone who cares.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.046
- I didn't do it.
- I saw you.

22:38.257 --> 22:41.092
- I turned it off.
- Tell them it was you.

22:41.260 --> 22:44.094
- Why would I?
- Dr. Finch will be fired.

22:44.262 --> 22:47.180
- Maybe she did it.
- Benton's with your patient.

22:47.390 --> 22:52.099
Her patient was an hour before yours.
She was there long before us.

22:52.312 --> 22:54.767
I turned it off. Honest.

22:55.732 --> 23:00.358
Hey, Cleo. I have a 12-year-old
with a 278 blood sugar.

23:00.570 --> 23:03.523
- Diabetes?
- I just got the test.

23:03.739 --> 23:08.152
- Overweight? Crappy diet? Couch potato?
- All the above.

23:08.369 --> 23:13.280
Kids eat junk food and play video
games. Bingo! Diabetes.

23:13.540 --> 23:14.571
How do I treat it?

23:14.833 --> 23:18.617
- Want me to talk to the family?
- That'd be great.

23:20.005 --> 23:23.124
I'd heard Gabe lost
a power struggle...

23:23.341 --> 23:25.085
...over tenure issues.

23:25.301 --> 23:26.796
You never checked?

23:27.011 --> 23:29.882
I've known Gabe my entire career.

23:30.098 --> 23:32.968
He's the reason I became an ER doc.

23:33.184 --> 23:35.592
I jumped at the chance to hire him.

23:36.270 --> 23:40.766
Or the chance to impress him.
Student hires teacher.

23:46.363 --> 23:49.862
Spielman suspected early Alzheimer's.

23:50.534 --> 23:54.282
She asked him to undergo
neurological testing.

23:54.454 --> 23:57.455
He blew up. Quit.
Won't speak to her.

23:57.666 --> 24:00.750
- You have to fire him.
- She wasn't sure.

24:01.336 --> 24:04.586
He can't cope with stress.
Wanders around-

24:04.797 --> 24:08.665
- He's always been scattered.
- He may endanger patients.

24:08.885 --> 24:12.467
I don't know.
I love him like a father.

24:12.638 --> 24:15.212
I don't know if I can fire him.

24:22.940 --> 24:26.640
- Is there family history of diabetes?
- My mother.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.817
Don't old people get it?

24:28.987 --> 24:33.067
This type, yes, but some children
are susceptible.

24:33.283 --> 24:35.192
He needs a diabetes clinic.

24:35.410 --> 24:39.538
A new drug works well for kids,
but it's expensive.

24:39.706 --> 24:42.410
Does your insurance
cover prescriptions?

24:42.625 --> 24:45.199
I'm not insured. How expensive?

24:45.420 --> 24:50.081
- $100 a month plus clinic visits.
- I can't afford that.

24:50.299 --> 24:54.131
He needs to lose weight, exercise
and control his diet.

24:54.345 --> 24:56.503
Then he might not need medication.

24:56.972 --> 25:00.341
I start a new job next week
with good benefits.

25:00.559 --> 25:03.595
But they start in 90 days.
Can it wait?

25:03.979 --> 25:06.552
With elevated blood sugar...

25:06.773 --> 25:09.857
...he's likely to have complications.

25:10.068 --> 25:14.018
Will this be a pre-existing condition
on my new insurance?

25:14.239 --> 25:18.023
If you treat him right now,
they won't cover him.

25:18.243 --> 25:23.200
I don't know the specifics of your
plan, but it's possible.

25:23.372 --> 25:25.579
I'll get him to diet and work out.

25:25.791 --> 25:30.003
He could take my mother's HMO's
diabetes pills for 90 days.

25:30.212 --> 25:32.786
He needs a physician's supervision.

25:33.007 --> 25:37.918
He needs a nutritionist, an exercise
specialist and education.

25:38.136 --> 25:41.137
What will that cost?
It's only three months.

25:41.431 --> 25:43.673
We weren't here, okay?

25:43.975 --> 25:47.142
Your son has a very serious disease.

25:47.354 --> 25:50.888
He could have kidney failure,
heart disease...

25:51.107 --> 25:52.767
...go blind, lose limbs.

25:53.192 --> 25:55.600
Let me talk to Dr. Finch.

26:00.032 --> 26:01.230
You're making it worse.

26:01.450 --> 26:04.570
He'd wait three months
to treat diabetes.

26:04.745 --> 26:09.324
If insurance won't cover him and
he can't afford medication...

26:09.541 --> 26:10.952
...what will happen over 3 years?

26:11.168 --> 26:14.751
With his grandmother's glyburide,
he might gain more weight.

26:14.963 --> 26:19.708
He'll start on half a pill and
the dad gets him to lose weight.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.753
Later he'll get better care.

26:21.970 --> 26:26.014
You don't know about Type ll
diabetes in children.

26:26.224 --> 26:29.889
Sedentary kids don't easily
change lifestyle.

26:30.061 --> 26:34.853
Dad hasn't kept him off the sofa
and potato chips in 12 years.

26:35.024 --> 26:36.566
How could he now?

26:36.776 --> 26:40.725
- Your CHF guy is in V-tach.
- I'll be right there.

26:40.946 --> 26:44.564
You accommodate the dad's
financial problems...

26:44.783 --> 26:46.776
...you're endangering a life.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.208
But what is it?

26:55.418 --> 26:59.961
It's ventricular tachycardia.
It's an abnormal heart rhythm.

27:01.716 --> 27:03.507
How much longer?

27:04.636 --> 27:06.260
A few minutes.

27:06.888 --> 27:09.295
A few minutes?

27:21.318 --> 27:22.563
Dr. Lawrence?

27:22.778 --> 27:24.486
- Can we talk?
- What's up?

27:24.655 --> 27:29.862
You've had Mrs. Karis waiting
for a prescription for four hours.

27:30.077 --> 27:33.492
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mrs. Karis.

27:34.914 --> 27:39.457
I got tied up with other patients.
I completely forgot.

27:39.669 --> 27:43.038
I'm very sorry.
One pill every six hours.

27:43.256 --> 27:47.170
Elevate your ankle and ice it
three times a day.

27:47.385 --> 27:51.252
- Gabe, can we talk in the lounge?
- Yeah.

27:52.848 --> 27:54.259
- Thanks.
- That's it?

27:54.475 --> 27:55.850
Appreciate it.

27:56.435 --> 27:58.843
Wait, what is she doing?

27:59.063 --> 28:01.518
- What the hell-?!
- Come on.

28:01.732 --> 28:04.483
Why's she taking off her ankle wrap?

28:04.693 --> 28:07.184
That's Brenda from Accounting.

28:07.404 --> 28:10.855
Her ankle's fine.
You've never seen her before.

28:11.074 --> 28:13.944
- You tricked me?
- Can we not do this here?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.532
It's been very busy here today!

28:17.163 --> 28:20.034
I had several ankle injuries!
I got confused.

28:20.875 --> 28:23.330
I went to see Renee Spielman.

28:37.307 --> 28:39.466
Time of death, 7:42.

28:44.898 --> 28:46.725
Mrs. Connelly?

28:49.235 --> 28:50.314
Has he gone?

29:10.881 --> 29:11.912
Barry...

29:12.758 --> 29:14.631
...you're so sweet.

29:15.927 --> 29:17.552
Yes, you are.

29:18.305 --> 29:19.799
I'll miss you.

29:24.060 --> 29:28.971
I need to call my son. Is there
a phone I could use nearby?

29:29.482 --> 29:30.941
I'll show you.

29:38.866 --> 29:40.859
Thank you, doctor.

29:46.290 --> 29:48.199
You're sure about this?

29:48.417 --> 29:51.916
Jail's not the best place
to have a baby.

29:52.129 --> 29:54.335
At least she won't be high.

29:55.215 --> 29:57.172
- There he is.
- Got him.

29:57.384 --> 30:01.796
5-3-2-0. White male with a
leather jacket in alley.

30:03.556 --> 30:07.470
- What happens now?
- Wait to see if it goes down.

30:16.652 --> 30:17.731
Bingo.

30:31.374 --> 30:34.079
- Get anything?
- Pills, some weed.

30:34.294 --> 30:36.701
What's this, Einstein, crank?

30:36.921 --> 30:39.673
Kid's a cash-and-carry pharmacy.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.508
You bitch!

30:42.677 --> 30:45.713
How could you?
You have nothing to say?

30:45.930 --> 30:48.551
How could you do this to me?!

31:05.240 --> 31:08.276
- Is Dr. Lawrence back?
- Not yet.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.654
Dr. Weaver?

31:10.870 --> 31:14.998
I may have been last to use
the Bunsen burner...

31:15.208 --> 31:17.200
...before the explosion.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.170
It's assumed Dr. Finch used it last.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.500
I used it too, probably after she did.

31:24.717 --> 31:28.168
I think I turned it off.
Possibly I didn't.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.261
It could've been my fault.

31:30.973 --> 31:35.599
Fire investigators say it was
a gas line. Ruptured pipe.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.388
I guess it wasn't me.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.232
Safety's our number one priority here.

31:44.402 --> 31:48.731
You cannot "think" you left on
a potentially dangerous lab tool.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.780
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.527
This is Gabe. Please leave
your name and number.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.572
Gabe, this is Kerry.

31:57.248 --> 32:00.581
I'm at the hospital.
Please call me back.

32:04.755 --> 32:06.712
Can I come in?

32:08.258 --> 32:09.373
Sure.

32:10.552 --> 32:13.470
This is my son's record, right?

32:14.181 --> 32:18.677
- Yes, it is.
- It says here that Eddie has diabetes.

32:18.894 --> 32:20.269
You put that in?

32:21.938 --> 32:25.437
- Tear it up, please.
- I can't do that.

32:26.150 --> 32:27.265
It's illegal.

32:29.612 --> 32:31.154
I'm not a fool.

32:31.823 --> 32:36.116
I'd never hurt my son.
We're just getting back on our feet.

32:36.952 --> 32:39.443
I don't have that kind of money.

32:39.622 --> 32:42.457
All those specialists and things.

32:42.958 --> 32:46.790
I'll have insurance in three months.
It's good.

32:46.962 --> 32:50.295
He'll diet, exercise,
use my mom's pills.

32:50.465 --> 32:53.799
- She gets the test kits.
- Glucose levels.

32:53.969 --> 32:57.302
If he's not improving,
we'll come back.

32:57.472 --> 32:59.963
I'll do whatever you tell me.

33:00.141 --> 33:04.518
If there's a chance to do this
any other way...

33:04.729 --> 33:06.223
...please help us.

33:08.858 --> 33:10.435
What are you doing?

33:10.651 --> 33:15.278
I was doing chart review in here.
Sprinklers soaked everything.

33:15.489 --> 33:19.487
- I may have just done the wrong thing.
- Me too.

33:19.827 --> 33:22.697
- Really?
- Yeah, about an hour ago.

33:22.913 --> 33:27.491
I destroyed what little was left
of a good man's career.

33:28.168 --> 33:29.876
What'd you do?

33:30.045 --> 33:33.793
Got a pregnant junkie arrested
for possession...

33:34.007 --> 33:36.758
...so she'd get clean in jail.

33:37.635 --> 33:41.004
Want to drown our sorrows
in ginger ale?

33:41.723 --> 33:44.593
No, I'm getting a surprise
baby shower.

33:45.184 --> 33:48.683
- It's supposed to be a surprise.
- I'll look surprised.

33:56.111 --> 33:57.392
I miss Doug.

33:59.781 --> 34:01.026
You call him?

34:03.744 --> 34:05.487
Has he called you?

34:06.246 --> 34:08.867
He leaves messages on my machine.

34:09.081 --> 34:13.909
He calls when I'm not there
so I don't have to talk to him.

34:14.712 --> 34:16.337
You don't want to?

34:18.216 --> 34:20.754
I don't know what else to say.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.382
- Rain check on that ginger ale?
- Sure.

34:45.533 --> 34:48.867
- Seen the Bernero T-sheet?
- The diabetic?

34:49.078 --> 34:53.906
- Why's it so hard to keep them?
- It was there a while ago.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.788
I gotta fill out a new chart.

34:57.003 --> 35:00.003
Bernero kid in Three can go home.

35:00.214 --> 35:03.084
Just a case of the stomach flu.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.756
Kick him out. We need the bed.

35:11.099 --> 35:14.599
- Have you seen Kerry?
- Curtain 2.

35:16.229 --> 35:17.605
- How's the baby?
- Great.

35:17.772 --> 35:22.066
- Come by for Carol's baby shower.
- Yeah, I'll try.

35:24.445 --> 35:28.692
Hang a banana bag and dress the
abrasions. He fell.

35:28.908 --> 35:31.031
You wanted me to come in?

35:31.244 --> 35:35.537
You've worked two days
in the last three weeks.

35:35.748 --> 35:40.326
We depend on you. When you call in,
it's tough on us.

35:40.544 --> 35:42.252
I'm not coming back.

35:43.130 --> 35:45.537
I'm sorry I've made it tough.

35:45.757 --> 35:48.544
I should've talked to you earlier.

35:48.760 --> 35:52.805
- Is everything all right?
- I've never been happier.

35:52.973 --> 35:57.136
I have Reggie and the baby.
I want to be with them.

35:57.352 --> 35:58.846
That's great.

35:59.062 --> 36:02.762
- If you need me to work a few shifts-
- No.

36:02.982 --> 36:07.146
When the baby's older and needs
you less, call me.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.985
- There's always a job for you here.
- Thanks.

36:12.116 --> 36:15.033
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

36:19.957 --> 36:21.700
Hello, baby!

36:22.334 --> 36:24.825
Roger was gonna pick him up.

36:25.003 --> 36:26.497
I know...

36:26.671 --> 36:28.664
I called him and told him.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.541
Roger! Reece is here.

36:35.263 --> 36:38.098
I got this DNA test for paternity.

36:39.142 --> 36:40.173
And...?

36:41.519 --> 36:45.563
I'm not gonna use it.
I'm gonna throw it away.

36:45.898 --> 36:46.929
Why?

36:50.319 --> 36:53.236
I touched your pregnant stomach.

36:54.531 --> 36:56.738
And I felt him move.

36:59.161 --> 37:03.490
I was there for his birth.
The nights in the NIC-U.

37:04.541 --> 37:08.788
When I wake up, he is the first
thing on my mind.

37:10.547 --> 37:13.417
When I go to sleep, he's the last.

37:17.095 --> 37:18.589
I love him.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.305
He's my son.

37:21.724 --> 37:26.682
I don't care about biology.
I don't need a DNA kit to tell me.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.481
I don't have a whole lot in my life.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.560
My career...

37:35.112 --> 37:38.315
...Jackie and her kids and that boy.

37:39.908 --> 37:43.277
He's more to me than
the rest combined.

37:45.413 --> 37:50.371
I'd lie down in front of a train
for him. That's how I love him.

37:51.753 --> 37:53.911
So I'm asking...

38:01.262 --> 38:03.088
I'm asking you...

38:05.641 --> 38:06.755
Please...

38:14.941 --> 38:18.441
Don't take my son away from me.

38:24.576 --> 38:25.856
Please.

38:33.209 --> 38:36.375
Weaver needs to see you
about overtime.

38:36.587 --> 38:37.702
Great. Okay.

38:39.006 --> 38:41.378
Surprise!

38:41.592 --> 38:44.842
Oh, my God! You guys...

38:45.053 --> 38:47.805
- You didn't know?
- I had no idea.

38:47.973 --> 38:52.635
- We chipped in on the bassinets.
- We have no money left.

38:52.853 --> 38:55.390
They're beautiful!

38:56.022 --> 38:58.893
Dr. Lawrence is in Trauma 2.

39:02.987 --> 39:04.647
Where have you been?

39:06.073 --> 39:08.031
Out walking by the lake.

39:10.328 --> 39:12.285
I was worried about you.

39:14.373 --> 39:16.864
When despair for the world
Grows in me

39:17.501 --> 39:22.459
I go lie down where the wood drake
Rests in his beauty on the water

39:23.382 --> 39:25.789
and the great heron feeds.

39:29.137 --> 39:31.842
I come into the peace
Of wild things

39:32.057 --> 39:36.006
Who do not tax their lives
With forethought of grief.

39:38.021 --> 39:41.105
I come into the presence
Of still water

39:41.315 --> 39:46.226
And feel above me the day-blind stars
Waiting with their light

39:48.656 --> 39:53.567
And for a time, I rest in the peace

39:55.412 --> 39:58.662
Of the world and am free.

40:05.714 --> 40:08.383
How can I remember a Blake poem...

40:08.550 --> 40:12.298
...I memorized 30 years ago,
and not remember...

40:12.512 --> 40:17.257
...that I saw a woman with a
sprained ankle this afternoon?

40:24.482 --> 40:27.103
I noticed something wrong a year ago.

40:29.403 --> 40:34.314
Memory loss and not being able
to find the right word.

40:36.660 --> 40:41.286
I went to Boston to see an
old classmate, a neurologist.

40:45.126 --> 40:46.585
He did a PET scan.

40:46.794 --> 40:50.709
It showed bilateral hypoperfusion
to the parietal areas.

40:52.425 --> 40:54.631
He started me on Aricept.

40:55.177 --> 40:59.720
It's supposed to put the brakes
on the Alzheimer's.

41:00.307 --> 41:01.802
But I guess...

41:03.060 --> 41:04.851
...it didn't help enough.

41:05.312 --> 41:07.103
They do great work...

41:07.272 --> 41:12.017
...upstairs at the Comprehensive
Dementia Center. You should go.

41:12.277 --> 41:14.946
I have a progressive
neurologic disorder.

41:15.155 --> 41:18.689
They work with neurotrophins,
antioxidants.

41:18.908 --> 41:23.202
- Maybe get into a clinical trial.
- I thought of committing suicide.

41:27.959 --> 41:30.580
I can't figure out when to do it.

41:32.088 --> 41:35.788
Too early, I'll miss
what little life is left.

41:35.966 --> 41:38.540
I wait too long,
I won't remember to do it.

41:41.263 --> 41:43.884
Please don't say that.

41:47.686 --> 41:49.928
God, I'm gonna miss this.

41:53.024 --> 41:56.393
Medicine has been my whole life.

41:58.446 --> 42:00.024
You could stay on.

42:00.531 --> 42:04.149
You could lecture the students
and Residents.

42:05.161 --> 42:06.821
But not see patients.

42:09.165 --> 42:13.458
You're a brilliant doctor
and a wonderful teacher.

42:13.669 --> 42:17.085
Please don't give up those gifts.

42:21.510 --> 42:23.882
I saw a woman this morning.

42:27.265 --> 42:28.843
Dementia.

42:31.770 --> 42:35.269
She had no idea where she was
or who she was.

42:41.737 --> 42:43.896
Ten years, that'll be me.

42:46.367 --> 42:47.861
Bedridden...

42:49.537 --> 42:51.196
...in diapers...

42:52.164 --> 42:54.619
...locked away in some home...

42:56.418 --> 42:58.494
...nobody coming to see me.

43:01.882 --> 43:04.088
I'll come and see you.

43:08.930 --> 43:11.551
But I won't know you're there.
