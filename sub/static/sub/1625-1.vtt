00:01.787 --> 00:04.536
I can't believe you guys
are still staring over there.

00:04.787 --> 00:07.536
Some mothers tend to breast-feed
for a lot longer these days.

00:07.537 --> 00:09.906
It's called detachment parenting.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.906
When the kid is that big,
it's called dating.

00:16.036 --> 00:18.906
I mean, he's gotta come up
for air at some point.

00:18.908 --> 00:22.176
No, he doesn't.

00:22.178 --> 00:23.911
Isn't he too old
to drink from the teat?

00:23.913 --> 00:25.450
The kid
is my height.

00:29.852 --> 00:32.853
Don't get any ideas.

00:32.855 --> 00:37.558
Well, it's happened:
I've lived too long.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.226
I'm ready to order.

00:39.228 --> 00:41.061
I can't.
I mean, I respect it all,

00:41.063 --> 00:43.464
but I'll throw up.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.432
I'll go.
I can't afford HBO,

00:45.434 --> 00:51.238
and it's the closest I can get
to seeing <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

00:51.240 --> 00:52.540
Hi, what can I get you?

00:52.542 --> 00:55.843
He's obviously good drink-wise.

00:55.845 --> 00:57.545
I'll have tea
and a turkey club.

00:57.547 --> 01:01.248
Anything for him?
Coffee for the milk?

01:01.250 --> 01:03.450
Burger? Fries?

01:03.452 --> 01:05.786
I'll have fries.

Ooh! Late night phone call.

01:30.445 --> 01:32.978
Ring-a-ding-dang.

01:32.980 --> 01:36.482
Someone's gonna get
their freaky freak on.

01:36.484 --> 01:37.850
It's my father.

01:37.852 --> 01:41.520
I don't judge.

01:41.522 --> 01:43.389
Hey, Daddy.

01:43.391 --> 01:44.924
Me? I'm fine.

01:44.926 --> 01:46.025
A little bummed:
It's truffle season,

01:46.027 --> 01:47.860
and no one I know knows
what a truffle is,

01:47.862 --> 01:49.295
but...[Giggles]

01:49.297 --> 01:50.730
Oh! Our estate auction?

01:50.732 --> 01:55.201
Yeah, I think I heard
something about that.

01:55.203 --> 01:58.070
But honestly, Daddy, I haven't
given it a second thought.

01:58.072 --> 02:00.606
No, you don't have to worry
about me.

02:00.608 --> 02:04.543
I am not at all emotional
about it.

02:07.147 --> 02:11.317
Wha--

02:11.319 --> 02:15.321
Thank God
it's not flip-flop Friday.

02:15.323 --> 02:16.756
Well, wait, I'll ask her.

02:16.758 --> 02:18.457
My father wants to know
if you'll come out to the prison

02:18.459 --> 02:20.326
- and finally meet him.
- Sure.

02:20.328 --> 02:21.961
Great. We'll see you
tomorrow.

02:21.963 --> 02:23.796
Bye.

02:23.798 --> 02:25.334
I'm not going.

02:28.736 --> 02:30.569
What? Why'd you say yes?

02:30.571 --> 02:32.471
'Cause you never tell
a man in prison no.

02:32.473 --> 02:35.107
He could hang himself
with his belt.

02:35.109 --> 02:36.609
Do not give me
that look.

02:36.611 --> 02:39.445
It happened to me
twice already.

02:39.447 --> 02:43.983
Oh, God, has anything not
happened to you twice already?

02:43.985 --> 02:45.885
Max, come on.
It's really important to me

02:45.887 --> 02:47.086
that you meet my father.

02:47.088 --> 02:48.387
Well, you never
met my father,

02:48.389 --> 02:49.622
and you don't see me
dragging you

02:49.624 --> 02:51.423
to every rail road boxcar
in the country

02:51.425 --> 02:53.425
trying to find him.

02:53.427 --> 02:56.629
Come on, it's gonna be
a really hard week for me.

02:56.631 --> 03:00.166
Has any week ever
not been hard for you?

03:00.168 --> 03:01.333
Everything I've ever owned

03:01.335 --> 03:03.369
is being auctioned off
to the public.

03:03.371 --> 03:04.770
I'm humiliated.

03:04.772 --> 03:06.071
Would this be a bad time
to tell you

03:06.073 --> 03:09.341
your one long face hair
is back?

03:09.343 --> 03:11.177
Well, there's something
they can't take away from me,

03:11.179 --> 03:14.980
and apparently,
I can't either.

03:14.982 --> 03:18.083
Well, well,
here comes the sun,

03:18.085 --> 03:22.054
and the moon
is looking great too.

03:22.056 --> 03:26.525
Oh, Earl, your flirting is
just the right amount of dirty,

03:26.527 --> 03:31.430
and that's not easy.

03:31.432 --> 03:35.467
Sophie's here.
Quick, how's my hairnet?

03:35.469 --> 03:37.436
I'm about to go over
and ask her out

03:37.438 --> 03:39.004
on a romantic date.

03:39.006 --> 03:41.473
A date?
Isn't that a waste of time?

03:41.475 --> 03:43.108
I mean, you guys
already have sex so often,

03:43.110 --> 03:45.444
I took a pregnancy test.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.817
Evening, Sophie.

03:51.819 --> 03:53.719
As you know, we have now
been together

03:53.721 --> 03:58.424
for 468 sexual encounters.

03:58.426 --> 04:00.125
I believe it is time
I take you out

04:00.127 --> 04:01.493
on a romantic date.

04:01.495 --> 04:04.063
Aw, I don't know.

04:04.065 --> 04:06.699
Who has time
to go out any more?

04:06.701 --> 04:08.868
Can't you just come over
and ruin my sheets

04:08.870 --> 04:11.303
like you usually do?

04:11.305 --> 04:13.372
Oh, just say yes.

04:13.374 --> 04:15.040
I'll take you
anywhere you want.

04:15.042 --> 04:18.344
Then take me
to the Channing Family auction

04:18.346 --> 04:20.546
and buy me something gold.

04:20.548 --> 04:22.147
How is this romantic?

04:22.149 --> 04:24.350
How is this romantic?

04:24.352 --> 04:29.321
It's gold.

04:29.323 --> 04:31.724
Wait, is that the catalog
from Caroline's estate auction?

04:31.726 --> 04:32.925
Yes.

04:32.927 --> 04:36.128
I found it in the trash
out behind our building.

04:36.130 --> 04:37.496
Caroline threw it there
'cause she doesn't

04:37.498 --> 04:38.731
wanna see it again.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.199
You better give it to me
before she comes out here

04:40.201 --> 04:43.535
and lights you on fire.
She kinda does that now.

04:43.537 --> 04:45.504
Sophie, let go, seriously.

04:45.506 --> 04:47.606
No, you're never
gonna win, Max.

04:47.608 --> 04:50.142
You know, when I was born,
the doctors tried

04:50.144 --> 04:53.812
to pry my dead twin sister
from my hands,

04:53.814 --> 04:56.048
but I never let go.

04:56.050 --> 05:00.886
She was my first doll.

05:00.888 --> 05:02.688
Hey, Sophie,
you don't happen

05:02.690 --> 05:03.856
to have any tweezers,
do you?

05:03.858 --> 05:06.191
Like, the really good
industrial kind?

05:06.193 --> 05:08.694
Oh, you know
about the hair?

05:08.696 --> 05:11.163
Oh.

05:11.165 --> 05:12.698
'Cause I was gonna have
to take you out for a beer

05:12.700 --> 05:15.901
and talk about it.

05:15.903 --> 05:18.470
Max, what is that thing
that you have behind your back?

05:18.472 --> 05:19.672
What? No, nothing.

05:19.674 --> 05:23.709
Yes, right here.

05:23.711 --> 05:25.210
Is that the auction catalog

05:25.212 --> 05:26.545
that just fell
between your legs?

05:26.547 --> 05:28.647
No, you're watching
an episode

05:28.649 --> 05:31.317
of <i>I didn't know I was pregnant.</i>

05:31.319 --> 05:33.085
What is this thing
doing here?

05:33.087 --> 05:35.721
Isn't it enough
I have a 2-foot face hair?

05:35.723 --> 05:37.756
Nice, Han.
She's upset again. Happy?

05:37.758 --> 05:39.425
Sorry, I thought
we were playing some kind

05:39.427 --> 05:40.993
of hiding game.

05:40.995 --> 05:42.661
Oh, reach for me
like that again

05:42.663 --> 05:43.762
and we'll be playing
a different game

05:43.764 --> 05:47.900
called "guess which part
of Han I cut off."

05:47.902 --> 05:49.068
Yeah, that's right.

05:49.070 --> 05:52.271
You better walk away.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.275
Now, can I have
my catalog back?

05:56.277 --> 05:58.510
You brought this in here?

05:58.512 --> 05:59.912
I can't believe it, Sophie.

05:59.914 --> 06:00.980
I can't believe you think
it's okay for you

06:00.982 --> 06:02.414
to just sit here
and casually flip

06:02.416 --> 06:04.416
through this catalog
that contains everything I love

06:04.418 --> 06:05.718
from my old life.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.387
I just think it's really
insensitive and stuff.

06:08.389 --> 06:10.522
I mean,
what are you thinking?

06:10.524 --> 06:12.024
What is wrong with you,

06:12.026 --> 06:13.292
I mean, besides
your obvious choice

06:13.294 --> 06:17.096
of bad fabric
and color.

06:17.098 --> 06:22.868
Oh, no.

06:22.870 --> 06:28.474
You back up your truck,
bearded lady.

06:28.476 --> 06:30.309
I'm insensitive?

06:30.311 --> 06:33.645
I'm the thief who stole
all those people's money?

06:33.647 --> 06:37.616
And you don't think this color
is happening?

06:37.618 --> 06:40.586
Pick up a copy
of Polish <i>Vogue.</i>

06:40.588 --> 06:42.354
All right, okay, okay.

06:42.356 --> 06:44.723
It's all getting
a little tense.

06:44.725 --> 06:45.791
I think we're all clear

06:45.793 --> 06:48.861
about what needs to happen
right now.

06:48.863 --> 06:51.830
Plink.

06:54.067 --> 06:56.368
Wow, this prison's
a lot better than the last one.

06:56.370 --> 06:57.803
It's more
like a country club.

06:57.805 --> 06:59.838
I mean, I think I saw a list
for mixed doubles

06:59.840 --> 07:01.173
where we signed in.

07:01.175 --> 07:03.175
Max, I know your idea
of a country club's

07:03.177 --> 07:04.810
an abandoned car
in the woods,

07:04.812 --> 07:06.345
but look around.

07:06.347 --> 07:08.881
There's security cameras
and bars on the windows.

07:08.883 --> 07:10.716
All right,
so it's a rough country club,

07:10.718 --> 07:14.686
where the strongest golfers
make the caddies their bitch.

07:14.688 --> 07:16.221
Max, my father's
in prison.

07:16.223 --> 07:18.424
Be more sensitive
and stuff.

07:18.426 --> 07:21.026
Look, I get it.
You're protective.

07:21.028 --> 07:22.628
He's your father
and you love him,

07:22.630 --> 07:27.366
but I'm sorry,
not everybody feels that way.

07:27.368 --> 07:28.801
- Daddy.
- There she is.

07:28.803 --> 07:30.669
Aww, uhh!

07:30.671 --> 07:32.704
How's my little girl?
I'm great, Daddy.

07:32.706 --> 07:34.606
- Yeah.
- I like the new uniform,

07:34.608 --> 07:36.408
and it isn't
at all prison-y.

07:36.410 --> 07:37.676
Yeah. I don't know
what's worse:

07:37.678 --> 07:39.211
Being locked up
or looking like you work

07:39.213 --> 07:42.448
at a banana republic.

07:42.450 --> 07:45.350
Now, wait a minute.
This can't be Max.

07:45.352 --> 07:46.852
The stories I've heard,
I was expecting more

07:46.854 --> 07:50.189
of a truck driver.

07:50.191 --> 07:51.890
Hey, Brian, you might wanna look
the other way.

07:51.892 --> 07:54.126
I think Max is here
to break me out.

07:54.128 --> 07:55.160
Isn't that right, Max?

07:55.162 --> 07:58.297
[Giggles]
Martin Channing.

07:58.299 --> 07:59.731
Shall we?

07:59.733 --> 08:01.700
[Laughter]

08:01.702 --> 08:04.470
Okay, fine,
your dad is awesome.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.300
Well, our projected
cupcake business growth ratio

08:13.302 --> 08:15.402
isn't where I want it to be,
but with autumn here,

08:15.404 --> 08:16.803
we have a lot of hope
in the launch

08:16.805 --> 08:18.471
of our new pumpkin spice flavor.

08:18.473 --> 08:20.874
Honey, I love you very much,

08:20.876 --> 08:22.008
but we're almost
out of time,

08:22.010 --> 08:25.245
and I can't talk any more
about cupcakes.

08:25.247 --> 08:27.180
Just wanted
to pick your brain.

08:27.182 --> 08:29.115
Now, Max, I asked you
to meet me here today

08:29.117 --> 08:30.517
because I wanna ask you
a favor.

08:30.519 --> 08:32.152
You want me
to smuggle something in?

08:32.154 --> 08:35.121
Something out?
I'm good either way.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.424
I want you to take Caroline
to the estate auction.

08:37.426 --> 08:38.692
Daddy, no.

08:38.693 --> 08:40.193
Why would I put myself
through that?

08:40.195 --> 08:42.095
Why would I ever go
where everybody knows who I am

08:42.097 --> 08:43.429
and be publicly humiliated?

08:43.432 --> 08:44.898
I know it will be hard
for you,

08:44.900 --> 08:46.433
but I promise
it'll be worth it.

08:46.435 --> 08:48.034
There's one thing
at that auction

08:48.036 --> 08:50.303
that I really care about
that I want you to have.

08:50.305 --> 08:51.471
What?

08:51.473 --> 08:53.173
The painting of me
as a baby?

08:53.175 --> 08:54.874
The sculpture of me
as a five-year-old?

08:54.876 --> 08:57.277
[Gasps] The tapestry
of me at 14?

08:57.279 --> 09:01.081
I have a pretty good
police sketch of me at seven.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.749
I want you two
to go there

09:02.751 --> 09:05.852
and get the loving cup you won
jumping with Chestnut.

09:05.854 --> 09:07.754
I know how much
that meant to you.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.090
Even if I could bring myself
to go through all that,

09:10.092 --> 09:13.493
we need every penny we have
for the cupcake business.

09:13.495 --> 09:14.728
Tell him, Max.

09:14.730 --> 09:18.098
Martin, you know
I'd do anything for you.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.533
Anything.

09:20.535 --> 09:21.735
But it's true.
We're broke.

09:21.737 --> 09:23.837
- Time is up.
- Seriously, Daddy,

09:23.839 --> 09:27.974
I use the box
our soap comes in as a wallet.

09:27.976 --> 09:31.644
Man, that is hard
to hear.

09:31.646 --> 09:35.315
Max, you're my girl, right?

09:35.317 --> 09:37.450
Am I?

09:37.452 --> 09:39.452
I want you to find a way
to get that cup.

09:39.454 --> 09:43.790
No matter what she says,
make sure she gets that cup.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.891
You follow me?

09:44.893 --> 09:46.593
You want me
to follow you?

09:46.595 --> 09:48.595
Can I even
go back there?

09:48.597 --> 09:50.230
No, you can't, miss.

09:50.232 --> 09:53.666
Oh, follow you,
like follow your thought.

09:53.668 --> 09:54.901
It's important for her,

09:54.903 --> 09:56.803
and it's important
for the both of you

09:56.805 --> 09:59.205
for your futures, all right?

09:59.207 --> 10:02.008
Get the cup.
What are you getting?

10:02.010 --> 10:06.679
The cup, Martin?

10:06.681 --> 10:07.781
I love you, sweetheart.

10:07.783 --> 10:09.115
Love you too, Daddy.

10:09.117 --> 10:12.152
And don't worry:
We'll get that cup.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.686
I'm not getting
that cup.

10:13.688 --> 10:16.256
What? Then why did you say
you would?

10:16.258 --> 10:17.991
You can't tell
a man in prison "no."

10:17.993 --> 10:19.692
He'll hang himself
with his belt.

10:19.694 --> 10:21.561
It happened
to you twice already.

10:21.563 --> 10:23.129
We have
to go get that cup.

10:23.131 --> 10:25.365
Why?

10:25.367 --> 10:28.568
There's money
in the cup.

10:28.570 --> 10:29.969
What are you talking about?

10:29.971 --> 10:32.038
He said we needed it
for our future,

10:32.040 --> 10:33.673
then he winked.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.408
It was either that,
or he was hitting on me,

10:35.410 --> 10:37.811
which, I'm not gonna lie,
I wouldn't hate.

10:37.813 --> 10:40.780
How would he even hide money
in a cup, Nancy Drew?

10:40.782 --> 10:43.016
Well, what does a loving cup
look like?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.050
Is it
like a bowling trophy?

10:44.052 --> 10:46.419
How dare you.

10:46.421 --> 10:49.656
Does it have, like,
a wood base?

10:49.658 --> 10:53.092
Yup, I used to hide my stash
in my mother's bowling trophy,

10:53.094 --> 10:54.994
and you're telling me the man
who invented a way

10:54.996 --> 10:57.197
to defraud most of New York
isn't as clever

10:57.199 --> 11:00.366
as a stoned 12-year-old
with a butter knife?

11:00.368 --> 11:02.469
Well, it was weird
how it was all about the cup

11:02.471 --> 11:04.270
and so little
about the pumpkin spice cupcake.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.572
Right?

11:05.574 --> 11:07.073
And you don't think
your father

11:07.075 --> 11:09.442
who spent a fortune
to turn you into a sculpture,

11:09.444 --> 11:11.978
presumably nude, wouldn't try
to figure out a way

11:11.980 --> 11:14.214
to take care
of his only daughter?

11:14.216 --> 11:16.015
The man's a criminal genius,

11:16.017 --> 11:19.219
and he found a way to put money
for your future in the cup,

11:19.221 --> 11:21.254
and clearly,
that's why he dragged me

11:21.256 --> 11:23.623
out to prison, because he knows
you'll do what I say

11:23.625 --> 11:25.225
'cause I'm the boss of you,
and pretty soon

11:25.227 --> 11:28.161
I'm gonna be
your stepmom.

11:28.163 --> 11:31.231
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,
I hear what you're saying,

11:31.233 --> 11:32.966
but I just
have one big question.

11:32.968 --> 11:34.300
How much
are we willing to bid?

11:34.302 --> 11:36.636
No, about my disguise.

11:36.638 --> 11:39.639
I know I'm a brunette,
but do I have bangs?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.678
Actually, I need two:
One for me,

11:45.680 --> 11:50.383
and one for my friend
Zooey Deschanel.

11:50.385 --> 11:53.052
What? You look like her.
Everybody does.

11:53.054 --> 11:57.290
It's the least expensive look
you can do and still get laid.

11:57.292 --> 12:00.793
God, this is from storage.
I haven't seen it in years.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.028
Wow, you had
all these closets,

12:02.030 --> 12:05.231
and no one in your family
is gay?

12:05.233 --> 12:09.035
Look! It's the Louie the XVI
I used to have in my playroom.

12:09.037 --> 12:11.337
My cousin Peter and I
used to climb in here

12:11.339 --> 12:13.306
and play French Revolution.

12:13.308 --> 12:14.807
I'd be Marie Antoinette,
and he'd help me

12:14.809 --> 12:16.576
put my hair up
in a high chignon.

12:16.578 --> 12:22.081
[Gasps] Oh, now I'm feeling bad
for his wife.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.616
So where do you think
the cup is?

12:23.618 --> 12:25.885
Let's look
over there.

12:25.887 --> 12:29.055
[Gasps] Oh, this is
from the summer house.

12:29.057 --> 12:31.124
Max, you know the expression

12:31.126 --> 12:34.060
"born with a silver spoon
in your mouth"?

12:34.062 --> 12:36.062
This is mine.

12:36.064 --> 12:37.730
Miss, do not handle that.

12:37.732 --> 12:39.532
I'm asking you
to put it down right now.

12:39.534 --> 12:41.768
Hey, you might
wanna relax the attitude.

12:41.770 --> 12:45.572
You really think my friend
Jennifer Love Hewitt,

12:45.574 --> 12:48.041
international movie
and Lifetime channel superstar,

12:48.043 --> 12:49.509
is gonna steal a used spoon?

12:49.511 --> 12:52.979
[Chuckles]
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.348
Now I see it.
[Chuckles]

12:55.350 --> 12:57.216
I thought
I was Zooey Deschanel.

12:57.218 --> 12:58.351
Eh, six of one.

12:58.353 --> 12:59.652
All you Hollywood brunettes
look alike.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.087
[Tones]

13:01.089 --> 13:04.023
The auction is starting,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:04.025 --> 13:05.358
Hi, Max.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.461
[Chuckles] I'm so excited
to be here.

13:08.463 --> 13:10.463
Oh, hello, Caroline.

13:10.465 --> 13:12.999
Sophie, I apologize
for the other day.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.535
I was really tense,
and I didn't mean it.

13:15.537 --> 13:17.337
I think you have
a unique sense of style.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.840
You do so much
with so little fabric.

13:20.842 --> 13:24.210
I do...

13:24.212 --> 13:29.616
And I see you took my advice
and got Polish <i>Vogue.</i>

13:29.618 --> 13:30.950
How nice
is this?

13:30.952 --> 13:32.986
We are finally
on a romantic date.

13:32.988 --> 13:35.154
We just came from lunch
at Rainbow Room,

13:35.156 --> 13:38.758
and I'm wearing
my best Fila tracksuit.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.228
Yah, now, he's going
to buy me something golden.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.797
Yah, I want
to be covered in gold.

13:44.799 --> 13:47.634
I want a golden shower.

13:51.071 --> 13:52.939
Let's see.
If I was a loving cup,

13:52.941 --> 13:54.273
where would I be?

13:54.275 --> 13:57.176
Some place with a lot of cash
shoved up inside you.

13:57.178 --> 13:58.811
How much do you think
is in there?

13:58.813 --> 14:00.179
Well, let's see.
The wooden base of the cup

14:00.181 --> 14:02.615
is about this big,
and I know you can get 20,000

14:02.617 --> 14:04.250
in an Altoids tin,

14:04.252 --> 14:06.219
and this is about three times
that size,

14:06.221 --> 14:08.621
so 60,000.

14:08.623 --> 14:12.725
$60,000?

14:12.727 --> 14:15.962
That's like a million dollars!

14:15.964 --> 14:18.731
So I could have $60,000
in an hour?

14:18.733 --> 14:22.068
Well, we.
We could have it.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.370
Did I say I?
How weird.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.081
And sold.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.349
Wow, you're getting
everything.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.351
Yes, we are.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.620
Aren't we, Miss Pickle?

14:38.622 --> 14:40.288
I'm Hamish McDonough,
by the way.

14:40.290 --> 14:45.527
Oh, I'm Max, and this
is my friend Katie Holmes.

14:45.529 --> 14:48.997
We won't speak
of it...

14:48.999 --> 14:54.002
But I just have to say:
Well done!

14:54.004 --> 14:57.339
And if you ever need anything,
don't hesitate.

14:57.341 --> 14:59.608
Oh, you have your own shop?

14:59.610 --> 15:01.543
"Just The Two Of Us" antiques.

15:01.545 --> 15:03.778
Is that you and Miss Pickle?

15:03.780 --> 15:08.250
No, dear,
I'm not insane.

15:08.252 --> 15:09.684
Next item for auction:

15:09.686 --> 15:13.321
A 19th century ivory and gold
bedside table,

15:13.323 --> 15:16.191
Oh! [Moans]

15:16.193 --> 15:19.494
Oh, say it again.

15:19.496 --> 15:23.331
This is highly unorthodox,
but I shall repeat the item.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.901
A 19th century gold and ivory
bedside table--

15:25.903 --> 15:29.871
[Moans]

15:29.873 --> 15:32.540
I'm a very lucky man, yes?

15:32.542 --> 15:34.576
We start the opening bid
on this item

15:34.578 --> 15:36.978
at $50,000.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.314
I'm out.

15:39.316 --> 15:41.516
- 50,000.
- Here.

15:41.518 --> 15:42.817
Do I hear 60,000?

15:42.819 --> 15:44.653
- 60,000!
- 60,000 over here.

15:44.655 --> 15:46.054
Do I hear 70,000?

15:46.056 --> 15:48.056
70,000.
Do I hear 80,000?

15:48.058 --> 15:50.392
Yes, you do!

15:50.394 --> 15:54.095
80,000 going once,
going twice,

15:54.097 --> 15:55.463
sold.
[Laughs]

15:55.465 --> 15:56.898
Hamish, you killed it.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.167
Yolo!

16:01.103 --> 16:02.737
And the next item
up for bid

16:02.739 --> 16:04.906
is a silver-plated
tin loving cup,

16:04.908 --> 16:07.475
property of Caroline Channing.

16:07.477 --> 16:08.843
How much do you think
this is going to go for?

16:08.845 --> 16:12.213
Kitsch is always a wild card,
but it has no real value.

16:12.215 --> 16:14.582
No real value? Please.

16:14.584 --> 16:16.518
I won that when no one
thought I could.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.821
I jumped 14 hurdles in the rain
with walking pneumonia.

16:19.823 --> 16:21.256
It's worth something.

16:21.258 --> 16:23.458
Yeah, 'cause it has money
in it.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.560
We start the bidding at $50.

16:25.562 --> 16:27.095
50.

16:27.097 --> 16:29.798
51.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.901
Sir, it's in increments
of $10.

16:32.903 --> 16:35.503
Then, I'm out.

16:35.505 --> 16:38.139
Sorry, the Rainbow Room
really sucked me dry.

16:38.141 --> 16:42.377
Hm, guess what else
is pretty dry right now?

16:42.379 --> 16:44.312
Do I hear 60?

16:44.314 --> 16:46.214
60.

16:46.216 --> 16:48.316
What are you doing?
You said it had no real value.

16:48.318 --> 16:50.085
I know,
but wouldn't it be camp

16:50.087 --> 16:52.187
to see Miss Pickle
taking a bath in that

16:52.189 --> 16:53.755
for my Christmas card?

16:53.757 --> 16:55.724
Do I hear 70?

16:55.726 --> 16:57.459
My cup
is not a puppy bath.

16:57.461 --> 16:59.728
- 70.
- 80.

16:59.730 --> 17:02.630
Back out now, ladies.
I'm a paddle bitch.

17:02.632 --> 17:04.799
Well, I'm a bitch bitch.
100.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.167
- 125.
- 150.

17:07.170 --> 17:10.038
- 175.
- Hamish came to play.

17:10.040 --> 17:13.974
So did we, I broke my hymen
getting that thing.

17:13.977 --> 17:16.411
Is that why it's called
a loving cup?

17:16.413 --> 17:18.480
- 200.
- I have 200.

17:18.482 --> 17:19.848
Do I hear 225?

17:19.849 --> 17:21.116
Look, Hamish.

17:21.117 --> 17:23.018
I know you have no interest
in what I would normally

17:23.020 --> 17:24.452
offer you
to get what I want.

17:24.454 --> 17:28.089
Don't be so sure.
I was bisexual till I was 62.

17:28.090 --> 17:31.159
Look, Katie Holmes
really wants this,

17:31.161 --> 17:32.627
and she's been
through a lot.

17:32.629 --> 17:35.630
True. It's yours.
I'm out.

17:35.632 --> 17:38.166
200 going once,
going twice.

17:38.168 --> 17:40.802
- Sold.
- Yes, I'm rich!

17:40.804 --> 17:45.006
Did you just
say "I'm"?

17:45.008 --> 17:48.443
I think
you're hearing me wrong.

17:48.445 --> 17:50.512
Okay, before we use
all this money on the business,

17:50.514 --> 17:52.514
we should take a vacation.
How 'bout it?

17:52.516 --> 17:55.216
You, me, Chestnut, jet skis.

17:55.218 --> 17:57.252
Okay, here we go.

17:57.254 --> 17:58.420
No, no, no.
Don't open it now.

17:58.422 --> 17:59.687
There are cameras here.

17:59.689 --> 18:00.922
We can just go over there
and open it

18:00.924 --> 18:02.057
right next to that thing
where you

18:02.059 --> 18:04.159
and your little queen cousin
played dress-up.

18:04.161 --> 18:06.194
Seriously, how could I not
have known that?

18:06.196 --> 18:07.695
When we played
Cowboys and Indians,

18:07.697 --> 18:10.865
he played
the Indian's makeup artist.

18:10.867 --> 18:12.534
I have to say, Max,
it'll be nice

18:12.536 --> 18:14.602
to have some money again,
but what's really nice

18:14.604 --> 18:16.538
is that now you see
who my father is,

18:16.540 --> 18:18.673
a man who,
despite all of his flaws,

18:18.675 --> 18:20.041
never stopped thinking
about what he could do

18:20.043 --> 18:22.110
to take care
of his little girl.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.350
It's empty?

18:29.352 --> 18:33.021
Son of a bitch.

18:33.023 --> 18:37.792
Martin, we just
have one question.

18:37.794 --> 18:40.562
Where's the money?

18:40.564 --> 18:42.530
I'm sorry, what?

18:42.532 --> 18:46.334
Where's...The money?

18:46.336 --> 18:48.002
[Laughs]
What?

18:48.004 --> 18:50.238
She's asking
where the money is.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.307
Oh! Uh, what money?

18:52.309 --> 18:53.875
The money in the cup, Daddy.

18:53.877 --> 18:55.710
The money you hid in the cup
that was supposed to be

18:55.712 --> 18:57.779
for my future?
Where's my 60 grand?

18:57.781 --> 19:00.215
Which, for anyone
who might be watching my lips,

19:00.217 --> 19:02.917
we were going
to give all to charity.

19:02.919 --> 19:05.420
Sweetheart, why do you
think I would hide money,

19:05.422 --> 19:08.022
besides the fact I'm here
for hiding money?

19:08.024 --> 19:09.958
Well, that might
have been my fault.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.559
No, it's
not her fault, Daddy.

19:11.561 --> 19:12.961
It's yours.

19:12.963 --> 19:15.163
You were supposed to take care
of me, and you didn't.

19:15.165 --> 19:17.232
You didn't think
about me at all,

19:17.234 --> 19:19.200
and it's not just me.
You hurt a lot of people.

19:19.202 --> 19:22.137
Do you ever even think
about them?

19:22.139 --> 19:23.538
Yes, I do.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.107
Now, every day,

19:26.109 --> 19:27.742
but I also think
about what I did to you

19:27.744 --> 19:30.044
every day, all day.

19:30.046 --> 19:31.913
I mean, back then,
when I figured out a way

19:31.915 --> 19:33.915
to get free money,
all I could think

19:33.917 --> 19:37.719
- about was the money.
- I hear that.

19:37.721 --> 19:39.454
But I really did
wanna give you something

19:39.456 --> 19:41.356
for your future, sweetheart,

19:41.358 --> 19:43.525
which is why I asked Max
to make sure

19:43.527 --> 19:45.793
that you got that cup.

19:45.795 --> 19:49.097
And I know it's only tin,
but it's the most valuable thing

19:49.099 --> 19:50.498
I could give you,
because it'll remind you

19:50.500 --> 19:54.135
that no matter
how hard the circumstances,

19:54.137 --> 19:57.472
you could get over any hurdle,

19:57.474 --> 20:02.010
even the ones
I put in front of you.

20:02.012 --> 20:03.745
Okay, well, we should go.
Our time's up.

20:03.747 --> 20:05.813
Yeah, but--what?
You just got here.

20:05.815 --> 20:10.285
Well, I think I'm done
for today.

20:10.287 --> 20:16.057
Boy, I've dreaded the day
you looked at me like this.

20:16.059 --> 20:19.861
Now that it's here,
it's even worse.

20:19.863 --> 20:21.095
I only hope
that one day

20:21.097 --> 20:22.730
you could look at me again

20:22.732 --> 20:25.667
the way you did
the day you won that cup.

20:32.340 --> 20:33.608
I love you, honey.

20:33.610 --> 20:37.779
I love you too, Daddy.

20:37.781 --> 20:39.647
Oh.
[Chuckles] Sorry.

20:39.649 --> 20:42.217
You meant her.

20:42.219 --> 20:44.786
See you next week?

20:50.192 --> 20:54.329
Wow, having a father
is rough.

20:54.331 --> 20:57.031
- Are you okay?
- I will be,

20:57.033 --> 20:59.133
because despite
what everyone else may think,

20:59.135 --> 21:00.935
he's not just a thief.
He's my father,

21:00.937 --> 21:03.271
and I love him.

21:03.273 --> 21:05.506
Look, if it's any consolation,
I now see

21:05.508 --> 21:06.741
how that could've happened
to him.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.009
I'm not condoning it,
but I see

21:08.011 --> 21:09.711
how people
can get caught up,

21:09.713 --> 21:11.479
'cause I am pissed as hell
that next week

21:11.481 --> 21:15.850
I won't be riding a horse
who's riding a jet ski.
