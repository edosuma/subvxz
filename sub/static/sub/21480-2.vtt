00:01.502 --> 00:03.671
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

00:03.754 --> 00:05.256
<i>A comet cannot change course.</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:07.258
<i>- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.</i>

00:08.426 --> 00:09.969
<i>We're not sure what's
just happened.</i>

00:10.052 --> 00:11.929
<i>There appears to be
something out there.</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:15.016
<i>The light is gone and thousands of
people have just suddenly appeared!</i>

00:15.099 --> 00:17.351
Diana Skouris. Tom Baldwin.

00:17.435 --> 00:20.688
You two will be one of the teams
that's responsible for investigating

00:20.771 --> 00:22.023
what happened to the returnees.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.233
Why disappear a little
girl from the 1940s,

00:24.316 --> 00:25.693
hold her for 60 years,

00:25.776 --> 00:28.216
and then send her back with the
ability to predict the future?

00:28.240 --> 00:31.323
Diana Skouris, your adoption of
Maia Rutledge is hereby complete.

00:31.407 --> 00:32.491
<i>Shawn Farrell.</i>

00:32.575 --> 00:33.659
Uncle Tommy!

00:33.743 --> 00:35.327
- Hi.
- He's all yours.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.747
- Hey, what about Kyle?
- Kyle is in a coma, Shawn.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.470
- What the hell did you do with Kyle?
<i>- I don't know what happened.</i>

00:40.494 --> 00:42.918
I put my hands on him,
that's it, he woke up.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.171
You're talking about some
kind of ripple effect.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.048
Diana Skouris to the
head of the class.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.217
The incidents themselves are
just catalysts for change.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.386
- Kyle! Kyle!
- No! Tom, don't!

00:52.720 --> 00:54.480
<i>You're not my son. Who are you?
What are you?</i>

00:54.513 --> 00:57.141
I'm human. I come from a
different time, your future.

00:57.224 --> 01:00.061
In my time, humanity is dying out.
Only those we took

01:00.144 --> 01:01.824
can prevent the catastrophe
from happening.

01:01.907 --> 01:04.507
That's why they've been altered and
seeded back into the timeline.

01:04.535 --> 01:06.609
I intend to provide a
safe haven for any 4400

01:06.692 --> 01:07.892
in this country who needs one.

01:07.916 --> 01:10.821
I guess what I'm asking you is if
I could stay here for a while.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.324
Tell me a little more about
this ability of yours.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.575
<i>This is a miracle.</i>

01:14.658 --> 01:15.868
<i>Is he really cured?</i>

01:15.951 --> 01:17.671
<i>But people should know
about that young man.</i>

01:17.695 --> 01:19.038
In time, they'll
know everything.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.206
My name's Devon.

01:20.289 --> 01:23.169
- Can I sign you up for a tour?
- Thanks, I'm just looking for my cousin.

01:23.193 --> 01:25.711
I'm afraid policy prohibits me
from discussing our membership.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.195
Then tell Shawn I'm here! If he
doesn't want to see me, fine.

01:28.279 --> 01:29.399
But that's up to him, right?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.802
<i>I wasn't pregnant when I was
abducted, but I was when I got back.</i>

01:32.885 --> 01:34.485
That baby could be the
key to the future

01:34.553 --> 01:36.555
and it has to be protected,
and I can do that.

01:38.849 --> 01:39.892
Go ahead! Run!

01:39.975 --> 01:42.645
It won't do you any good.
That baby belongs with me.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.605
Dennis Ryland is no
longer in charge here.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.608
Maybe you should call
Washington and talk to him.

01:46.632 --> 01:49.110
I don't have to call Washington.
They've got me on speed dial.

01:49.193 --> 01:52.571
Tess Doerner, diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia at the age of 15.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.855
You're sure Tess drew this
before they started building?

01:54.879 --> 01:56.492
She made her first
sketch two weeks ago.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.095
That thing started
going up yesterday.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.954
We're talking about the
people who took me.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.681
They want me to get
in touch with them.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.374
That's why they put
the plans in my head.

02:03.499 --> 02:04.875
It's gonna get built anyway.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.878
Yesterday, a few patients were
compelled to work on this thing

02:07.962 --> 02:10.131
and today, it's the
entire hospital.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.050
NTAC? Collier?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.402
Does this look like
their calling card?

02:14.426 --> 02:15.586
<i>Someone knows we're 4400s.</i>

02:15.610 --> 02:17.346
- That child yours?
- That's my daughter.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.933
- Abomination begets abomination.
<i>- Richard!</i>

02:21.016 --> 02:22.810
We've got to get out of here.
Now!

02:22.893 --> 02:23.936
Time to go.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.409 --> 02:39.702
Hurry, Richard.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.788
Hurry.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.232
As of tonight, Abendson
State Hospital

04:33.315 --> 04:34.608
is officially under quarantine.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.527
The patients will
remain locked down.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.487
Hospital staff and
affected NTAC personnel

04:38.570 --> 04:39.738
will be confined to the site

04:39.822 --> 04:42.741
until we've isolated the
source of the compulsion.

04:42.767 --> 04:43.927
That sounds like a good plan,

04:43.951 --> 04:45.231
but who's gonna watch over them?

04:45.314 --> 04:47.358
The last group we sent was
compromised within hours.

04:47.441 --> 04:49.665
Which is, quite frankly,
a little disturbing.

04:49.748 --> 04:52.251
I mean, if you think of
this like an epidemic,

04:52.334 --> 04:55.462
in the CDC, we'd call Tess
the sole disease vector.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.548
You remove her, you
remove the urge to build.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.966
Except, as far as we know...

04:59.049 --> 05:01.010
None of those agents had
any contact with Tess.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.096
Right, so it's like the flu
or any other airborne virus.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.806
You catch it, you
can pass it on.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.392
What is this thing
supposed to be, anyway?

05:08.475 --> 05:09.518
My guess,

05:09.601 --> 05:12.313
and I cannot emphasise the
word "guess" strongly enough,

05:12.396 --> 05:13.897
is that Tess is
telling us the truth.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.858
It's some kind of
communication device.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.360
To contact who? The future?

05:19.194 --> 05:22.781
The only way to find out is to let
the patients finish building it.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.545
That night on Highland Beach, they
were trying to tell us something.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.817
The conversation was cut shod.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.580
Which is why we've been stumbling
around in the dark this last year.

05:29.653 --> 05:32.791
Tess is the only 4400 who
remembers where she was taken.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.210
No, claims to remember
where she was taken.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.921
She is also the only
paranoid schizophrenic.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.380
And it sounds to me like
you two have been spending

05:40.404 --> 05:42.573
a little too much
time around her.

05:42.718 --> 05:46.889
Maybe I caught the bug,
too, but I agree with them.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.102
The quarantine orders at the hospital
remain in effect until further notice.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.272
The guards will rotate shifts
to minimise their exposure.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.274
So where does that leave us?

05:57.983 --> 06:00.223
Until we're sure the compulsion
is not spreading anymore,

06:00.247 --> 06:02.375
you two aren't going
anywhere near that facility.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.326
You never told me
I was a prisoner.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.203
Have you ever seen a
prison cell, Shawn?

06:09.286 --> 06:10.766
It looks nothing
like your apartment.

06:10.790 --> 06:14.166
God damn it, Jordan, since when do
you decide who I see and talk to?

06:14.249 --> 06:16.502
This is about your
cousin, isn't it?

06:17.086 --> 06:20.339
- So you did know he was here.
- I know he was rude and aggressive

06:20.422 --> 06:22.102
and had to be escorted
from the premises...

06:22.126 --> 06:23.675
You mean thrown out.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.470
It might've been handled
more smoothly, Shawn.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.723
But all in all, I'd have to
say it was for the best.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.266
Kyle is my friend.

06:31.934 --> 06:33.560
He was your friend.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.981
Look. A year ago, you came to
me looking for a new life.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.067
Your old one in shambles.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.487
Kyle, friend or not, is
part of that old life.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.780
So what do you want me to do?

06:44.863 --> 06:47.023
You just want me to cut him
loose and forget he exists?

06:47.074 --> 06:50.786
He is no different than your mother,
your brother or your friend Nikki.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.287
- Don't...
- They do not understand

06:52.371 --> 06:54.051
what it is we're trying
to accomplish here.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.130
You know, maybe I don't, either.

07:05.175 --> 07:09.179
Well, then I suggest you
pack your bags and leave.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.200
So what happens the next time you
start screaming out in pain?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.453
Do what's right for you, Shawn.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.497
I'll take care of myself.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.089
- Do you have a seven?
- Go fish.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.384
I'm so sorry I'm late.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.846
Who do we have here?

07:50.929 --> 07:53.056
This is Carrie. She
lives downstairs.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.726
The UPS man left their
package with us by mistake.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.395
And when her mom came to get
it, Carrie was with her.

07:58.479 --> 08:02.107
And now I'm invited to her birthday party.
And it's a sleepover.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.984
I can go, right?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.947
Hi, Carrie. I'm Diana.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.950
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.328
I already said it's okay.

08:14.495 --> 08:18.165
I think we should probably talk
to Carrie's mom first, don't you?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.462
Look, you know what?
It sounds fine to me.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.714
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

08:28.717 --> 08:29.885
Isabelle's asleep.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.724
Rainy day came sooner
than expected.

08:35.849 --> 08:40.145
- Do you think we lost them?
- I'm not ready to stop for pie just yet.

08:40.229 --> 08:43.357
I've got $1,200 here.
Another $300 in my pocket.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.983
I'm carrying $200.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.904
We're gonna have to get those back
windows replaced in the morning.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.240
This should be enough to
carry us through to Montana.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.843
What did Eric say
when you called him?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.993
He was a little surprised
to hear from me.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.162
But even back in quarantine

08:57.246 --> 08:59.581
he used to say how us 4400s
should stick together.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.042
Yeah. We didn't have much choice
back then, though, did we?

09:06.088 --> 09:08.173
The bank can wire us our
savings when we get there.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.634
If things get really
bad we can sell these.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.221
I put that ring on you forever.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.583
I guess you and
Isabelle were right.

09:21.607 --> 09:23.487
We should have taken off
when we had the chance.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.818
It's gonna be a long night.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.736
You want me to drive a shift?

09:30.571 --> 09:31.822
Get some sleep.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.311
Maia, what's wrong?

10:02.394 --> 10:05.814
I'm sorry. I know it's late, but
Maia really wanted to come home.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.942
- Why is that, sweetie?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

10:09.651 --> 10:10.819
Some of the girls,

10:10.902 --> 10:12.738
not my daughter, but
some of the other girls

10:12.821 --> 10:13.947
were teasing Maia.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.408
I guess she said she has a
crush on Frank Sinatra.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.412
Old Blue Eyes. Do you blame her?
Right?

10:20.495 --> 10:23.582
Most 9-year-olds don't even
know who Frank Sinatra was.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.417
I wanna go to bed.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.797
I guess it got pretty nasty.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.342
I feel terrible.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.385
Maybe Maia can come
back another time.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.889
- Just her and Carrie.
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.557
Thank you.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.643
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.699
Maia.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.204
I know you didn't fall
asleep that fast.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.376
It was awful.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.088
- You were right.
- I didn't wanna be right.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.383
I don't need any friends.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.468
Everyone needs friends, Maia.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.560
Maia, I really think we
should talk about this.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.391
Well, I don't.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.503
Buck's burger's good
as I remembered.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.131
Kind of a strange thing to
have on top of your list,

11:54.214 --> 11:55.340
but, hey, you know what?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.093
I'm glad I could make
your dreams come true.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.972
Kyle, shouldn't you be in bed?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.516
Dad, I'm 21.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.186
Yeah, that's what I have
to keep reminding myself.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.191
I'm making some popcorn.
Do you want some?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.861
You're kidding me.
You could eat more?

12:16.153 --> 12:18.238
I've been eating quarantine
food for a year.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.001
You guys might be keeping
the country safe,

12:20.025 --> 12:21.777
but your cafeteria sucks.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.204
Hello?

12:27.581 --> 12:28.623
Hello?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.002
Kyle.

12:37.674 --> 12:40.051
We gotta get the baby
out of the cold.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.597
I don't think there's any
motels on this road.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.934
I was thinking we head
south, catch the 35.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.737
Guy should lose his high beams.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.993
That's the first car we've
seen in what, like, 50 miles?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.462
Get your head down!

13:24.721 --> 13:26.515
Oh, my God, Richard! It's them!

13:40.862 --> 13:42.364
Hold on! Hold on!

13:55.377 --> 13:58.046
- Everybody okay?
- I think so.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.589
Okay. Let's go.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.609
Spread out.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.579
Hey, Maia, sweetie.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.123
It's wake-up time.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.457
Okay.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.836
It was a late night, huh?

14:40.297 --> 14:42.340
All right. Fifteen more minutes.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.306
You know what? Frank
Sinatra is the coolest,

14:49.389 --> 14:51.683
and don't you let anyone
ever tell you different.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.122
So, you didn't read any of it?

15:14.205 --> 15:17.042
No. I wouldn't want my
daughter reading my diary.

15:17.626 --> 15:21.713
- You keep a diary? Am I in it?
- Come on. Don't flatter yourself.

15:22.005 --> 15:25.175
So really, you don't even
know if what she sees means,

15:25.258 --> 15:29.012
you know, things during the
day, TV shows, ponies, whatnot.

15:29.220 --> 15:33.016
Or it could be what she sees a week,
a month, a year down the line.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.810
No, no, no. She hasn't had one of
those visions in like four months.

15:36.811 --> 15:40.315
- That's what she tells you, anyway.
- Why would she lie?

15:41.483 --> 15:43.485
She wants to be normal, right?

15:43.568 --> 15:46.237
Every time she makes a prediction,
someone calls her a freak.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.491
Look, I understand.
You're her mom now.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.493
There are certain protocols.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.296
Next time I'm over, why
don't I take a peek?

15:53.328 --> 15:55.872
Come on. You think that would
be any less of a betrayal?

15:57.666 --> 15:59.709
Respecting Maia's privacy
is no small thing

15:59.793 --> 16:01.586
but, I mean, you've
got to weigh that

16:01.670 --> 16:03.922
against the information that
could be in that diary.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.048
You know what?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.884
When you stop trusting a parent,
it's really hard to start again.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.844
And yes, I'm speaking
from experience.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.140
Hey, I'm glad it's
not my decision.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.560
But if Maia's having visions,
you should know about it.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.312
And you should know
what they are.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.568
Is it bad?

16:27.612 --> 16:29.781
I just jammed it
when we spun out.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.880
I just need to walk
it off a little more.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.621
Follow this stream south.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.916
Hike through the water a bit,
throw them off our trail.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.002
It'll be cold.

16:42.252 --> 16:45.171
It'll keep us awake.
After a mile, we'll...

16:46.965 --> 16:48.675
We'll double back west.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.928
Head straight for the highway.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.347
Sounds easy when you say it.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.808
We can do it.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.601
We're gonna do it, right?

17:03.356 --> 17:06.358
Keep her quiet. She's gonna
bring them right to us.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.968
Does the name Gene
Pecusa ring a bell?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.304
Yeah, returnee 927.

17:34.471 --> 17:38.683
Let me guess. He still has the ability
to turn $20 into a crushing hangover.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.327
And a night in the
drunk tank downtown.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.513
Come on. We gotta ferry him
back to his halfway house.

17:42.537 --> 17:43.997
Give it to Mortimer and Falcone.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.067
- We got something else on our plates?
- Yeah.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.613
Everything's quiet at Abendson. No
one's been allowed near the tower.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.410
- That's the problem, isn't it?
- Tom. Tom, no. You...

17:57.660 --> 18:00.580
You do remember that Jarvis has still
got your letter of resignation.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.703
Yeah, she wants results. I'm
gonna give them to her.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.335
And besides, you wanna know what
that thing is as badly as I do.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.738
I'm trying not to
think about it.

18:06.762 --> 18:08.764
Yeah, well, I can't
think of anything else.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.092
So, it sounds like Tess
has got her hooks in you.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.844
I don't have the urge
to pick up a tool belt.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.476
I'm coming with you.

18:23.186 --> 18:26.397
It's all right, Tess. We're
taking you back to Abendson.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.359
We signed you out, Tess. No one
from NTAC is coming after you.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.736
Not you people. The doctors
in the submarines.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.946
They're watching us!

18:34.280 --> 18:36.080
Come on, what, are you
having second thoughts?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.492
No, just get in.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.592
So, you still owe me

18:55.468 --> 18:58.721
$4, $5 for those two six-packs.
Something like that.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.433
I got a $20 right here if you
think you can take it from me.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.813
Look at you, man. Back
among the living.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.857
- You look great.
- I walk. I talk.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.775
I seem to have full
control of my limbs.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.280
You still hit like a girl.
Nothing's changed.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.074
- Four years? Plenty's changed.
- No, what are you talking about?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.398
We saw each other right when
you got out of the hospital.

19:20.422 --> 19:22.912
- I don't remember any of that.
- You don't?

19:23.079 --> 19:25.874
So, you don't remember sitting
naked in the sprinklers?

19:25.957 --> 19:28.543
No. That sounds like
something you'd do.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.545
- Well.
- Thank you.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.755
I never got a
chance to say that.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.507
For getting me out of
the coma, thank you.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.927
You know, if it
hadn't been for me,

19:38.011 --> 19:42.223
you wouldn't have been in that
stupid hospital anyway. So...

19:42.307 --> 19:45.727
No, I'd have been the one who
disappeared into 4400 boot camp.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.937
Maybe I'd have come back
with the magic hands.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.482
- All right, all right. Okay.
- Speaking of disappearing, you jerk!

19:51.566 --> 19:52.942
Kyle, don't go there yet.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.360
- Come on.
- Don't go there?

19:54.444 --> 19:56.237
Your mom is so freaked out.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.573
You haven't seen her in a year.
You haven't seen anybody.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.075
Your brother. My dad.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.655
- What was going on with you and Nikki?
- Kyle, I don't wanna talk about Nikki.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.291
We're all really worried
about you, man.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.672
You don't need to be.
I mean, I'm fine.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.385
I've been to that place
where you're living.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.430
There are some serious <i>Stepford
Wives</i> vibes going on there.

20:22.513 --> 20:23.556
You know that, right?

20:25.558 --> 20:28.645
All that stuff about "unlocking
the 4400 inside everybody."

20:28.728 --> 20:29.812
Yeah?

20:33.107 --> 20:35.187
You don't really believe
Collier can do that, do you?

20:37.946 --> 20:39.030
Kyle.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.034
Look around us, man.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.953
The world is in a
total freefall.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.413
These centres,

20:47.497 --> 20:50.500
they're a chance to bring people together.
Maybe our last chance.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.003
I don't just believe
that he can do it.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.215
I believe that he has to do it.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.552
Sounds like someone
got inside your head.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.142
- He said you wouldn't understand.
- Collier?

21:09.560 --> 21:10.645
Yeah.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.981
I gotta tell you, man.
He was right.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.375
<i>Isabelle!</i>

21:39.465 --> 21:40.508
Richard!

21:41.718 --> 21:43.094
What happened?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.680
Guess I wasn't looking
where I was going.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.849
Okay, you just need to rest.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.329
You think they're
stopping for breaks?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.481
- No.
- Come on, Richard.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.567
All right, five minutes.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.953
All right, people! Come on!
Everyone out to the tower.

22:09.203 --> 22:12.206
Come on! We have a lot of work to
do and not a lot of time to do it.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.460
So let's go. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

22:15.543 --> 22:19.464
- Come on, you heard me. Let's go!
- This one's mine. Stand over there.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.841
- Hey, Kevin!
- Come on.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.509
Look! I escaped.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.139
Always thinking of me.

22:28.931 --> 22:32.518
Kevin's a genius, you know.
But he doesn't brag about it.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.037
I bet in a couple days all
these berries will be ripe.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.206
Don't eat 'em now.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.709
The last thing we need
is to start cramping up.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.328
Look.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.685
I thought you said
they weren't ripe.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.126
They weren't.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.965
Isabelle?

23:45.133 --> 23:46.217
Had to be.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.973
Way to go, little girl.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.784
They're gonna have to work fast.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.956
- I'm gonna help them.
- It's not funny, Diana.

24:17.039 --> 24:20.293
- No, I really wanna do this.
- No, you'd only be in the way.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.545
You don't understand. I
really need to do this.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.706
Have these sent to my office.
Shawn, I've been looking for you.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.667
- Yeah, I took a walk.
- We have a special visitor tonight.

25:01.751 --> 25:03.294
She has pancreatic cancer.

25:03.377 --> 25:07.381
Her husband is willing to donate
real estate for a 4400 centre

25:07.465 --> 25:08.549
in Los Angeles.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.510
Tonight doesn't really
work for me, Jordan.

25:11.302 --> 25:14.639
Well, you have five, no, six
hours to get in the mood.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.892
Mood's got nothing to do with it.
I'm just not working tonight.

25:40.831 --> 25:45.920
- Richard, please. Don't do this.
- We don't have another choice.

25:46.295 --> 25:49.090
There's three of them.
They're gonna kill you.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.217
Not if I get my hands on
one of those shotguns.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.760
You can barely walk.

25:56.222 --> 25:57.557
It's our only chance.

25:59.016 --> 26:02.353
And I've got to do it now while
I still have the strength.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.190
If I'm not back by sundown,

26:06.941 --> 26:09.235
take the baby and walk due west.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.613
It's that way. Just keep
going in a straight line.

26:14.782 --> 26:15.908
Understand?

26:28.963 --> 26:31.507
I'd give up another 50 years
if it meant finding you again.

26:58.743 --> 27:01.621
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- Knew about what?

27:01.704 --> 27:03.704
Baldwin and Skouris signed
Tess Doerner out of here

27:03.748 --> 27:05.082
and took her back to Abendson.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.586
Yeah, they're
rebuilding the tower.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.005
That would be one theory.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.378
No crying. We can't cry now!

28:05.017 --> 28:06.060
Drop ii.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.397
Or I'll cut you in half.

28:13.067 --> 28:14.735
Yeah, turn around.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.960
I taught you boys
better than this.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.003
Get up!

28:49.603 --> 28:51.355
Diana, how's it going?

28:51.439 --> 28:53.566
It turns out we're in better
shape than I thought.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.819
- The fire missed most of the wiring.
- So, how soon till it's ready to go?

28:56.902 --> 28:59.238
We've gotta finish
triangulating the dishes

28:59.321 --> 29:01.073
and then we're good.

29:02.575 --> 29:03.993
Just get it done.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.244
Baldwin.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.912
We've got your man!

29:08.038 --> 29:09.540
Either you come out,

29:10.124 --> 29:15.045
or the next sound you hear is him
being blown straight to hell!

29:15.129 --> 29:17.715
I told you, she's
miles away by now!

29:18.299 --> 29:21.385
Open your mouth again,
I'll cut your tongue out.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.679
Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.271
Watch him.

29:34.190 --> 29:36.066
Lily, run!

29:45.034 --> 29:47.119
- Screw it in tighter.
- It's almost done.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.540
Are you sure you don't
wanna say goodbye to me?

29:52.416 --> 29:53.793
I'm gonna miss you most of all.

29:55.878 --> 29:57.171
Clear. Sir.

30:07.181 --> 30:09.433
Last time, Baldwin.
Unlock the door.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.394
I can't do that. You
said you wanted results.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.897
Listen to me, Baldwin! You
are not in your right mind.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.274
And these are not the results
that I was talking about.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.860
Now, step away
before you get hurt.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.076
- Take it.
- Ready?

30:28.744 --> 30:31.413
No, no, just wait! Wait!
Just wait! Just wait.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.042
We need answers. That
tower might provide them.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.086
Just listen to me.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.463
It's a risk, I know.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.554
But sometimes, when you
wanna get to the truth,

30:42.578 --> 30:44.385
you have to take
a leap of faith.

30:44.468 --> 30:45.511
Just listen to me.

30:46.262 --> 30:47.304
No.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.057
You want the truth?

30:56.564 --> 30:59.733
Tess Doerner's memories of the future.
They're not memories.

30:59.817 --> 31:02.653
She read them in a shod story by H.P.
Lovecraft.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.780
The Shadow Out of Time.
I have it right here.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.325
I underlined some of the passages that
showed up verbatim in your report.

31:10.411 --> 31:11.704
They're just another delusion.

31:13.581 --> 31:14.623
No.

31:14.832 --> 31:18.127
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- Okay, let's go. Okay, you guys take it!

31:25.259 --> 31:26.468
Hurry!

31:27.678 --> 31:28.804
Hurry.

31:29.513 --> 31:33.142
- Everyone step away from that tower!
- The doctor!

31:49.241 --> 31:50.409
Yeah.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.079
Isabelle!

32:42.211 --> 32:43.462
Isabelle!

32:52.304 --> 32:55.182
My son! What did you make me do?

32:55.265 --> 32:59.353
Gabriel! My God! My son!
No! No! Gabriel!

32:59.436 --> 33:00.646
Richard!

33:05.943 --> 33:07.403
It wasn't me!

33:10.447 --> 33:13.117
That creature made
me pull the trigger!

33:13.659 --> 33:16.453
You've unleashed the
devil into this world,

33:16.996 --> 33:19.415
and we're all going to burn!
That...

33:33.887 --> 33:35.014
Richard!

34:48.962 --> 34:50.005
Where are you?

34:55.803 --> 34:57.137
Where are you?

34:57.221 --> 34:59.261
All right. Let's get everyone
back into their rooms.

34:59.285 --> 35:01.787
We need a full head count before
the next round of medications.

35:02.309 --> 35:03.811
Where are you?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.730
I did what you wanted, right?

35:08.315 --> 35:09.691
Talk to me!

35:09.983 --> 35:11.485
Come on, Tess.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.321
We all could use a little rest.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.491
But they lied to me.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.328
Or did I lie to you?

35:30.170 --> 35:32.673
Well, somehow, I wanted more.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.592
I don't know what I expected.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.052
Another ball of light,

35:37.136 --> 35:39.555
a booming voice from the sky.
Something.

35:40.681 --> 35:43.809
- Could we have built it wrong?
- Maybe.

35:44.017 --> 35:47.855
And all I know is that I don't feel
like picking up a hammer anymore.

35:47.938 --> 35:51.275
And 10 minutes ago, that
was all I could think of.

35:51.358 --> 35:52.818
If there's new information.

35:52.901 --> 35:53.986
Yeah.

35:56.488 --> 36:00.033
NORAD said the pulse dissipated
before it left the atmosphere.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.078
Could be all this sound and fury
was for absolutely nothing.

36:05.706 --> 36:08.167
Now our first priority is to
help the hospital personnel

36:08.250 --> 36:09.334
restore order here. Okay?

36:09.418 --> 36:11.778
And then I want all of you who
were infected with this thing

36:11.802 --> 36:13.172
to be checked out
by NTAC Medical.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.775
Are you including me in that order?
Because I'm not sure if I...

36:15.799 --> 36:17.134
You were infected.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.377
Because if you're standing
here telling me you weren't,

36:19.401 --> 36:21.445
I'm putting a date on that
letter of resignation.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.268
I was definitely infected.

36:26.810 --> 36:27.978
I thought so.

36:28.061 --> 36:30.314
We could use a little help
policing the area here.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.399
And we need to get
rid of these tools

36:32.482 --> 36:34.526
before one of the patients
hurts themselves.

36:34.610 --> 36:35.694
You heard the man.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.322
Excuse me, Dr Clayton?

36:42.743 --> 36:45.871
Kevin? Did you just speak to me?

36:48.123 --> 36:49.458
I guess I did.

36:50.876 --> 36:55.589
I haven't said anything
for a long time, have I?

36:57.633 --> 36:59.384
Try six years.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.228
I can think again, too.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.190
I don't know what happened,

37:13.857 --> 37:16.860
but I feel

37:18.820 --> 37:20.030
better.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.418
You had me followed?

37:33.502 --> 37:35.545
I could have had your
conversation recorded.

37:35.629 --> 37:38.799
- I just thought that might be pushing it.
- Oh, my God, Kyle's right.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.592
I am some kind of prisoner.

37:40.676 --> 37:44.054
Shawn, I've told you, you can
leave here anytime you want.

37:44.137 --> 37:47.182
And I meant it.
But until you do,

37:47.599 --> 37:50.269
I will not allow these
shadows from your past

37:50.352 --> 37:53.355
to alter your perceptions of what it
is we're trying to accomplish here.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.564
You're too important.

37:54.648 --> 37:58.568
No, no, no. You mean, you need me
to help bring in the big cheques.

37:59.528 --> 38:03.198
Shawn, the money is
a means to an end.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.159
The goal is what matters.

38:06.243 --> 38:09.121
Ensure the future.
Save the planet.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.041
I can't do that without you.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.552
You want proof the future
works in mysterious ways?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.554
Look no further than
Mr Kevin Burkhoff.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.056
Yes, instead of contacting
the future, we got him.

38:28.140 --> 38:30.726
Not as disappointing as it
might seem at first blush.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.103
Burkhoff was a tenured
professor of neurochemistry

38:33.186 --> 38:34.313
at Stanford University.

38:34.396 --> 38:37.524
Neuroscience. Only class
I ever got a "B" in.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.943
Yeah, you're not alone.

38:40.027 --> 38:43.363
Only a handful of people work at the
top of the field at any given time.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.033
Our Mr Burkhoff was
the heir apparent.

38:46.575 --> 38:49.036
Until he suffered his first
delusion at the age of 30

38:49.119 --> 38:50.954
and he was institutionalised
two years later.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.080
What was he working on?

38:52.372 --> 38:54.708
You want a ripple effect?
How's this?

38:55.208 --> 38:58.378
Burkhoff specialised in
dormant neural pathways.

39:00.797 --> 39:04.134
He was trying to wake up parts
of the brain that we can't use.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.137
Parts that would do what?

39:07.554 --> 39:10.557
Well, parts that could lead to all
kinds of special new abilities.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.893
Like precognition. Right, Marco?

39:13.268 --> 39:15.604
Precognition. Telekinesis.

39:16.229 --> 39:19.649
- Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.
- Maia Rutledge. Orson Bailey.

39:20.192 --> 39:23.695
You're saying that Burkhoff is the
father of the 4400 technology?

39:24.404 --> 39:26.948
- It's possible.
- And we just woke him up.

41:18.435 --> 41:20.896
<i>Miss Oster next door
is getting a kitten.</i>

41:20.979 --> 41:22.189
<i>Hope she lets me play with it.</i>

41:22.272 --> 41:24.472
<i>There's going to be a book
about how we all came back...</i>

41:24.496 --> 41:26.109
<i>Me and Diana get to
be a real family...</i>

41:26.193 --> 41:28.195
<i>A computer for Christmas!</i>

41:28.737 --> 41:30.405
<i>The pizza place
when it closes...</i>

41:30.489 --> 41:31.823
<i>get his job back.</i>

41:31.907 --> 41:33.408
<i>Mommy's bosses will be punished.</i>

41:35.577 --> 41:39.289
<i>Mommy's bosses will be
punished for betraying us.</i>
