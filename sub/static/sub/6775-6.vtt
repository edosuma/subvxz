by
HOME BOX OFFICE

01:20.500 --> 01:24.652
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, LP.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.957
( clearing throat)

03:16.700 --> 03:20.295
DAMN, THIS HOUSE
IS COLD.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.225
SHIT, HATI'IE, IT'S LIKE
A GODDAMN ICEBOX.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.798
WELL, NO WONDER.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.256
GIRL,
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

03:35.260 --> 03:39.697
WE LIVE IN THE DESERT,
IT GETS COLD AT NIGHT.

03:39.700 --> 03:43.249
YOU PLAN ON
SLEEPING ALL DAY ?

03:43.260 --> 03:47.356
I WAS PLANNING
TO GET ME SOME BREAKFAST
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.057
C'MON, BITCH,
GET YOUR LAZY ASS UP.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.757
COME ON, NOW, THIS AIN'T
THE OLD FOLKS HOME.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.895
HATI'IE.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.589
HATI'IE ?

04:17.330 --> 04:24.122
HATI'IE ?

04:24.130 --> 04:27.452
SHE GETS
DUMPED BY A GUY,
SHE GETS A PUPPY.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.248
SO NOW, SHE'S GOT
LIKE 15 DOGS

04:31.260 --> 04:33.125
THEY'RE ALL MALE,
THEY'RE ALL HUGE,

04:33.130 --> 04:35.894
AND THEY SIT THERE AND WATCH
WITH THEIR TONGUES HANGING OUT

04:35.900 --> 04:37.390
WHILE I WORK
ON HER.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.992
IT'S LIKE BEING
IN SOME LIVE SEX SHOW

04:39.000 --> 04:42.254
FOR ASIAN BUSINESSMEN
AND FRAT BOYS.

04:42.260 --> 04:45.957
WHICH I ACTUALLY
DID FOR A WHILE,

04:45.960 --> 04:48.428
BACK IN THE '805,
TO MAKE SOME MONEY.

04:48.430 --> 04:52.423
I GOT THIS GREAT THING GOING
WITH PING-PONG BALLS

04:52.430 --> 04:54.625
YOU'D REALLY LIKE.

04:54.630 --> 04:57.258
I'M GONNA SHOW IT
TO YOU SOME TIME.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.194
HEY, WOULDN'T IT
BE FUNNY

04:59.200 --> 05:01.919
IF I GOT SOME HEDGE CLIPPERS
AND CUT OFF YOUR DICK ?

05:01.930 --> 05:03.795
WHAT ?

05:03.800 --> 05:06.428
DO ME A FAVOR, OKAY ?
DON'T READ THAT SHIT
IN FRONT OF ME.

05:06.430 --> 05:07.658
YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

05:07.660 --> 05:09.321
YEAH, COME ON,
I'M LATE.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.195
I'M AT THE PART
WITH THE DOLL.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.952
( male )
WHY IS YOUR DOLL ANGRY ?

05:12.960 --> 05:15.155
BECAUSE
SHE GOT RAPED.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.299
REALLY,
BY WHO ?

05:17.300 --> 05:19.222
BY YOU.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.551
BRENDA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT "RAPED" MEANS ?

05:21.560 --> 05:25.724
IT MEANS SHE WAS FORCED
INTO SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
AGAINST HER WILL.

05:25.730 --> 05:28.949
IT'S SO COOL,

05:28.960 --> 05:31.428
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY DOING IT
TO SCARE 'EM INTO
LEAVING YOU ALONE, RIGHT ?

05:31.430 --> 05:33.398
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME ?
I WAS EIGHT.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.651
DID IT WORK ?

05:34.660 --> 05:36.093
NO, IT DIDN'T WORK.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.920
I JUST GOT A WHOLE
NEW LEVEL OF SCRUTINY

05:37.930 --> 05:39.352
BY A WHOLE DIFFERENT
SET OF VULTURES,

05:39.360 --> 05:40.622
ONLY THIS TIME
THEY WERE WOMEN.

05:40.630 --> 05:42.791
I'M LEAVING,
YOU STILL WANT A RIDE ?

05:56.600 --> 05:58.397
YOU ALRIGHT ?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.254
YES, I'M FINE.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.319
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TODAY ?

06:02.330 --> 06:06.391
AH, WELL...
THE CABINETS,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.527
I'M GONNA TRY
TO ORGANIZE THE CABINETS.

06:08.530 --> 06:10.521
GOOD.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.296
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.518
ALRIGHT.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.195
HEY, BOBBY !

06:22.200 --> 06:23.326
( Bobby)
YEAH.

06:23.330 --> 06:25.218
BRING THE LINCOLN TOWN CAR
AROUND FRONT.

06:25.230 --> 06:27.095
SO, YOU'RE THE OTHER
FISHER BOY, HUH ?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.056
THE ONE FROM
WHERE, OREGON ?

06:29.060 --> 06:30.220
SEA'I'I'LE.

06:30.230 --> 06:31.754
RIGHT, WITH
THE HEALTH FOOD THING.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.920
YEP.

06:32.930 --> 06:34.397
I REMEMBER YOUR DAD
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.254
I'M SORRY TO HEAR
ABOUT HIM, MAN.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.251
HE WAS
A FUNNY GUY.

06:38.260 --> 06:40.558
YEAH ?

06:42.060 --> 06:43.527
NO, YOU DON'T PAY.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.191
DON'T PAY ?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.519
YEAH.

06:46.530 --> 06:48.157
YOUR DAD BURIED MY BROTHER
A FEW YEARS BACK.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.025
IT'S IN TRADE.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.021
MY FATHER TRADED A FUNERAL
FOR OIL CHANGES ?

06:56.030 --> 06:57.918
YEAH,
GUESS SO.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.420
BYE, MOM.

07:07.430 --> 07:09.318
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

07:17.030 --> 07:19.328
SO, WOULD YOU LIKE US
TO TAKE CARE OF

07:19.330 --> 07:21.525
FINDING YOU A CEMETERY PLOT,
MR. JONES ?

07:21.530 --> 07:23.418
YEAH, I DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT.

07:23.430 --> 07:24.988
WOULD YOU LIKE
A DOUBLE PLOT ?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.490
WHAT FOR ?

07:26.500 --> 07:30.596
WELL, ONE FOR YOUR WIFE,
AND ONE FOR YOU.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.091
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.692
IT THIS WHAT YOU DO
ALL THE TIME ?

07:34.700 --> 07:36.656
SELL PEOPLE
THEIR OWN GRAVES ?

07:36.660 --> 07:39.026
WELL, YES, SIR,
THIS IS MY JOB.

07:39.030 --> 07:41.021
DON'T TRY TO PULL
THAT SHIT WITH ME, BOY.

07:41.030 --> 07:43.021
I WANT A SIMPLE BOX,
NO FRILLS.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.749
YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME
BECAUSE I'M OLD.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.193
I'LL KICK YOUR ASS !

07:47.200 --> 07:49.953
JUST A SINGLE PLOT THEN.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.189
NO, DOUBLE PLOT.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.519
SHIT.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.227
WILL YOU WANT MRS. JONES
PREPARED FOR VIEWING ?

08:02.230 --> 08:03.629
YES, I WANT
TO SEE HER.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.928
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
MESSING WITH HER NONE.

08:05.930 --> 08:08.057
I DON'T WANT YOU TO CUT HER,
OR STICK HER,

08:08.060 --> 08:10.494
OR PICKLE HER
LIKE AN EGG.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.718
IF YOU WANT A VIEWING
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND--

08:12.730 --> 08:15.699
THAT'S MY WIFE, BOY,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO TOUCH HER !

08:15.700 --> 08:19.090
MR. JONES,
I CAN GUARANTEE

08:19.100 --> 08:21.625
THAT YOU WILL NOT
WANT TO SEE HER,
NOR WILL ANYONE ELSE,

08:21.630 --> 08:23.598
UNLESS SHE'S
BEEN EMBALMED.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.558
I WOULD BEG YOU TO CONSIDER
WHAT YOUR WIFE WOULD WANT.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.051
SHE'S DEAD, FOOL,
DON'T MATTER WHAT SHE WANTS.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.652
WELL, YES, SIR,
BUT...

08:32.460 --> 08:36.419
AFI'ER DEATH, THE BODY
IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO DECOMPOSE,

08:36.430 --> 08:38.557
MUCH QUICKER
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.027
THE SKIN BEGINS
TO SEPARATE,

08:40.030 --> 08:41.622
THERE'S QUITE
AN UNPLEASANT ODOR.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.518
SHOULD YOU CHOOSE
TO FORGO EMBALMING,

08:43.530 --> 08:45.589
MY RECOMMENDATION
WOULD BE CREMATION,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.420
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

08:47.430 --> 08:51.855
THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS,
MR. JONES.

08:51.860 --> 08:56.092
I DON'T WANT TO BURN HER UP,
I WANT TO SEE HER.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.058
FINE, YOU DO
UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER,

08:59.060 --> 09:02.223
THAT MEANS SHE'LL NEED
TO BE EMBALMED.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.928
I AIN'T PAYING
FOR THAT.

09:07.930 --> 09:10.194
SIR, THE COST
IS MINIMAL.

09:13.200 --> 09:18.228
I WILL WAIVE
THE EMBALMING FEE,
MR. JONES, ALRIGHT ?

10:07.630 --> 10:09.894
THAT WAS A GOOD SERMON,
I THOUGHT.

10:09.900 --> 10:10.992
DID YOU ?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.251
YOU DIDN'T ?

10:12.260 --> 10:13.955
I DIDN'T REALLY
LISTEN TO IT.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.496
( female )
HELLO !

10:15.500 --> 10:17.559
HELLO.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.754

DAVID'S FRIEND.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.751
TRACY.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.320
I KEEP ASKING HIM WHEN
WE'RE GONNA MEET HIS FIANCEE.

10:25.330 --> 10:26.991
DOES SHE GO TO
ANOTHER CHURCH ?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.251
YES.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.659
WHAT FIANCEE ?

10:29.660 --> 10:31.093
TRACY, I TOLD YOU,

10:31.100 --> 10:32.727
JENNIFER AND I HAD
BROKEN IT OFF YEARS AGO.

10:32.730 --> 10:33.856
YOU DID ?

10:33.860 --> 10:36.021
SO THERE'S
NO FIANCE NOW ?

10:36.030 --> 10:38.157
EXCUSE US.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.698
IT'S REALLY A SORE SUBJECT
FOR US ALL.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.053
OW, YOU'RE HURTING
MY ARM.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.618
( male )
RUTH ?

10:44.630 --> 10:46.120
HIRAM.

10:46.130 --> 10:47.290
HOW ARE YOU ?

10:47.300 --> 10:49.097
I'M FINE,
THANK YOU.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.058
HAVE YOU BEEN
COMING TO CHURCH ?
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU.

10:52.060 --> 10:54.096
I WANTED TO
GIVE US SOME SPACE.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.024
PLEASE DON'T SACRIFICE
ANYTHING ON MY ACCOUNT.

10:57.030 --> 10:59.658
LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.821
I MISS YOU,
CAN I SEE YOU ?

11:01.830 --> 11:03.195
NO.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.953
RUTH, HAVEN'T YOU PUNISHED
YOURSELF ENOUGH ?

11:05.960 --> 11:08.497
SHALL WE GO ?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.889
HI, I'M DAVID FISHER.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.356

11:16.130 --> 11:18.098

THE HAIRDRESSER.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.351
IT'S NICE TO
MEET YOU, SON.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.622
DON'T CALL
ME THAT.

11:20.630 --> 11:21.551
DAVID.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.494
WHAT ?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.695
I'LL GO
GET THE CAR.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.850
NO, I'M COMING
WITH YOU.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.851
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

11:31.860 --> 11:33.725
YOU LOOK WELL.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.920

11:43.930 --> 11:46.125

11:46.130 --> 11:47.791
OKAY, I HEAR YOU, JESUS !

11:55.960 --> 11:57.598
I WANT TO

11:57.600 --> 12:00.228
OH, I'M SORRY,
WE'RE NOT OPEN YET.

12:00.230 --> 12:02.050
EVERYONE WHO KNOWS
ANYTHING IS GONE.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.891
I WANT TO
SEE MY WIFE.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.788
LOOK, SIR, I'M SORRY, I DON'T
DEAL WITH THE DEAD PEOPLE.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.119
SO, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO COME BACK

12:07.130 --> 12:08.495
WHEN MY BROTHERS

12:08.500 --> 12:10.149
BITCH, I DON'T NEED
YOUR PERMISSION.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.697
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO COME BACK LATER.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.099
OW, MY FOOT.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.089
WHAT ?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.829
HELP, HELP !

12:16.830 --> 12:19.549
THERE'S A WHITE GIRL TRYING
TO CRIPPLE AN OLD BLACK MAN.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.221
HON ESTLY.

12:23.030 --> 12:24.918
LOOK, SIR, YOU CAN'T

12:36.000 --> 12:38.389

12:42.330 --> 12:44.423
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND ?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.421
HELL IF I KNOW.

12:46.430 --> 12:49.126
HIS WIFE DIED
AND HE WANTED
TO SEE HER.

12:49.130 --> 12:50.927
I GUESS SHE ISN'T
READY YET.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.420
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
ABOUT TO KEEL OVER,

12:52.430 --> 12:53.590
SO, I HELP HIM
SIT DOWN,

12:53.600 --> 12:54.851
THEN I HAD TO LISTEN TO HIM
BITCH AND MOAN

12:54.860 --> 12:56.691
ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

12:56.700 --> 12:58.622
AND THEN HE JUST
LIKE PASSED OUT.

12:58.630 --> 13:01.098
NOW I CAN'T GET HIS
FUCKING HAND TO LET GO.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.829
MAYBE HE DIED.

13:02.830 --> 13:04.058
VERY FUNNY.

13:04.060 --> 13:05.994
NO, HE'S STILL
BREATHING AND FARTING.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.954
CAN YOU HELP ME

13:10.960 --> 13:12.723
SURE.

EVERYBODY'S ALONE.

14:21.330 --> 14:23.821

14:23.830 --> 14:26.025
YOU DIE ALONE,
GODDAMNIT.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.393
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR WIFE.

14:43.130 --> 14:45.826
YOU DIDN'T
KNOW HER.

14:54.030 --> 14:55.327
JESSICA WILCOX ?

14:55.330 --> 14:58.891
I'M NATE FISHER,
NATHANIEL'S SON.

15:00.660 --> 15:04.050
I WONDERED WHY I HADN'T HEARD
FROM NATHANIEL IN QUITE A WHILE.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.528
I HATE THIS.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.328
I HATE THAT I'LL NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.025
HE WAS SUCH A KOOK.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.258
A KOOK ?

15:12.260 --> 15:13.852
DAD ?

15:13.860 --> 15:15.953
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EVER
MADE ME LAUGH LIKE THAT.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.019
HE HAD SUCH
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

15:18.030 --> 15:19.725
SO I HEAR.

15:19.730 --> 15:22.119
HE WAS REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.122
I'M NATE,
NOT DAVID.

15:25.130 --> 15:26.722
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

15:26.730 --> 15:28.698
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TOOK OFF.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.021
YOUR FATHER REALLY
RESPECT ED YOU FOR THAT.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.352
SAID HE WISHED HE'D HAD THE GUTS
TO DO THAT WHEN HE WAS A KID.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.323
MS. WI LCOX,

15:39.330 --> 15:42.549
DID YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
ARRANGEMENT WITH MY FATHER ?

15:42.560 --> 15:43.697
ARRANGEMENT ?

15:43.700 --> 15:45.349
UH, IN OUR LEDGERS,

15:45.360 --> 15:46.759
SOME OF THE FUNERALS
WERE MARKED DIFFERENTLY

15:46.760 --> 15:48.455
AND YOUR MOTHER'S
WAS ONE.

15:48.460 --> 15:51.395
IT SEEMS MY FATHER SOMETIMES
TRADED HIS SERVICES

15:51.400 --> 15:53.891
FOR PAYMENTS
OTHER THAN CASH.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.255
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY,

15:56.260 --> 16:00.026
BUT CAN I SEE SOME
KIND OF IDENTIFICATION ?

16:00.030 --> 16:02.396
DRIVER'S LICENSE
WOULD DO.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.527
AH, SURE.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.694
LIBRA, HUH ?

16:11.700 --> 16:14.954
I WOULD'VE TAKEN YOU
FOR A CAPRICORN.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.551
YOU DRINK A LOT OF COFFEE
UP IN SEATTLE ?

16:19.560 --> 16:20.652
YEAH.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.321
BETTER BE CAREFUL.

16:22.330 --> 16:24.821
IT'LL GIVE YOU
KIDNEY STONES.

16:36.230 --> 16:37.697
OH, COME ON.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.349
SURELY YOU WOULDN'T
BEGRUDGE YOUR FATHER

16:39.360 --> 16:41.499
SUCH A MINOR
IN DULGENCE.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.018
MY FATHER
NEVER SMOKED POT.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.248
NOT IN FRONT OF YOU,
HE DIDN'T.

16:47.260 --> 16:48.727
IT'S THE FINEST ORGANIC,

16:48.730 --> 16:52.120
GROWN UP IN SAN FRANCISCO
BY MY SON.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.121
TAKE IT.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.826
IT'S YOUR FATHER'S
MONTHLY SUPPLY.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.324
HOW IS YOUR MOTHER DOING
WITH THE GRIEVING, DAVID ?

17:05.330 --> 17:06.649
SHE'S FINE.

17:06.660 --> 17:07.752
AS FAR AS
I CAN TELL.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.853
YOU KNOW HER, SHE LIKES
TO SUFFER IN SILENCE.

17:09.860 --> 17:11.157
UH-HUH.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.924
THAT SEEMS TO BE
A FAMILY TRAIT.

17:13.930 --> 17:17.024
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOD'S WILL
FOR US TO LIVE OUR LIVES FULLY.

17:17.030 --> 17:19.294
BREATHING IN THE JOY
AROUND US,

17:19.300 --> 17:21.052
NOT JUST SHOULDERING
THE PAIN.

17:21.060 --> 17:23.620
GOD WANTS YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

17:23.630 --> 17:26.428
I CALL THEM
ENERGY BUNS.

17:26.430 --> 17:28.159
THEY'RE MY OWN RECIPE.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.559
WELL, NOT REALLY,
ADDING THE PEPPERS

17:29.560 --> 17:31.050
WAS SOMETHING I PICKED UP
ON MY HONEYMOON.

17:31.060 --> 17:32.425
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO BRAZIL ?

17:32.430 --> 17:33.795
AH, NO.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.495
OH, MY GOD, BRAZILIANS ARE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

17:35.500 --> 17:36.649
ALIVE !

17:36.660 --> 17:38.457
THEY'RE LIKE THESE
FABULOUS MONGRELS

17:38.460 --> 17:40.928
WHO HAVE INCORPORATED
ALL THE VERY BEST ATTRIBUTES

17:40.930 --> 17:42.852
FROM EVERY RACE.

17:42.860 --> 17:45.499
I MEAN, ALL THAT
CROSS-BREEDING, HELLO ?!

17:45.500 --> 17:47.525
I HAD A HALF-BREED MUTT
WHO LIVED TO BE ALMOST 20.

17:47.530 --> 17:49.555
AND THEN I GOT
THIS PURE-BRED CORGI

17:49.560 --> 17:52.290
AND ITS HIPS DISINTEGRATED
BEFORE IT WAS EVEN TWO.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.427
HERE YOU GO.

17:57.430 --> 17:59.648
FUCK YOU,
CHURCH FREAKS.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.594
WELL, ENJOY.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.124
DO YOU COOK ?

18:03.130 --> 18:05.325
I HATE COOKING
JUST FOR MYSELF.

18:05.330 --> 18:08.151
THAT'S THE WORST PART
ABOUT BEING DIVORCED.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.550
THAT AND THE WHOLE
NO REGULAR SEX THING.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.357
DAVID ?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.658
COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT ?

18:15.660 --> 18:17.719
ALONE ?

18:17.730 --> 18:19.698
EXCUSE US.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.397
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

18:26.400 --> 18:27.651
RUTH WON'T
TALK TO ME.

18:27.660 --> 18:28.627
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

18:28.630 --> 18:29.927
I WAS HOPING
THAT YOU COULD--

18:29.930 --> 18:32.251
YOU WERE FUCKING MY MOTHER
WHILE MY FATHER WAS STILL ALIVE

18:32.260 --> 18:33.818
AND NOW
YOU WANT ME TO--

18:33.830 --> 18:35.559
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
IF YOU'RE UPSET.

18:35.560 --> 18:36.822
UNDERSTAND THIS,

18:36.830 --> 18:38.957
WHATEVER YOU HAVE WITH MY MOTHER
IS BETWEEN YOU AND HER.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.428
BUT I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN HELPING YOU.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.195
TABLE FOR ONE ?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.191
ARE YOU THE OWNER ?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.258
YES.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.898
DID YOU KNOW
MY FATHER...

18:57.900 --> 18:59.959
NATHANIEL FISHER ?

19:01.030 --> 19:03.055
THIS USED TO BE
OUR STOREROOM.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.358
BUT WHEN I FINALLY GOT
A LOAN FROM THE BANK,

19:05.360 --> 19:07.055
I PUT AN EXTENSION
OUT THE KITCHEN.

19:07.060 --> 19:10.291
YOUR FATHER BURIED MY WIFE
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.450
I HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY
FOR THE FUNERAL.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.349
HE ASKED IF HE COULD HAVE
THIS ROOM AS HIS OWN.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.453
AND THAT WOULD BE
MY SETTLEMENT.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.125
WHAT DID
HE DO HERE ?

19:22.130 --> 19:24.223
I DON'T KNOW.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.096
STAY AS LONG
AS YOU LIKE.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.455
HOW OFTEN DID
HE COME HERE ?

19:31.460 --> 19:33.496
SOMETIMES WE WOULDN'T
SEE HIM FOR MONTHS.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.196
SOMETIMES HE WAS
HERE EVERYDAY.

20:18.830 --> 20:20.957
( music )

21:04.900 --> 21:07.892
LEAVE YOUR
TEARS BEHIND

21:07.900 --> 21:10.789
COME WITH US
AND CLIMB

21:10.800 --> 21:16.352
THE PLEASURES OF THE JOURNEY
TO THE CENTER OF THE MIND

21:16.360 --> 21:20.626
COME ALONG
IF YOU CARE

21:20.630 --> 21:23.952
COME ALONG IF
YOU CARE

21:23.960 --> 21:28.829
TAKE A RIDE TO THE LAND
INSIDE OF YOUR MIND

21:28.830 --> 21:31.890
BEYOND THE SEAS
OF THOUGHT

21:31.900 --> 21:35.051
BEYOND THE REALM
OF WHAT

21:35.060 --> 21:38.120
ACROSS THE STREAMS
OF HOPES AND DREAMS

21:38.130 --> 21:40.951
WHERE THINGS
ARE REALLY HOT

21:40.960 --> 21:44.327
COME ALONG
IF YOU CARE

21:44.330 --> 21:48.699
COME ALONG IF
YOU CARE

21:48.700 --> 21:52.852
TAKE A RIDE TO THE LAND
INSIDE OF YOUR MIND

21:52.860 --> 21:55.852
( gunshots )

21:57.460 --> 22:00.054
IF ALL OF MANKIND

22:00.060 --> 22:02.654
WOULD TAKE
THE TIME TO JOURNEY

22:02.660 --> 22:06.027
TO THE CENTER
OF OUR MIND

22:24.300 --> 22:25.619
AH, MRS. FISHER.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.689
GOOD AFTERNOON,
NIKOLAI.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.157
I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE HAD
A CHANCE TO THANK YOU YET.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.220
WHEN KROEHNER STARTED PRESSURING
EVERYONE TO CUT US OFF,

22:33.230 --> 22:37.121
MOST OF US OUR SUPPLIERS
JUST ABANDONED FISHER & SONS.

22:37.130 --> 22:38.791
YOU STUCK WITH US.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.529
OF COURSE I STICK
WITH YOU.

22:40.530 --> 22:41.599
HERE.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.791
THANK YOU.

22:48.860 --> 22:50.919
WELL, THESE FLOWERS ARE NOT
GOING TO PLANT THEMSELVES.

22:50.930 --> 22:52.659
SUCH DELICATE SKIN.

22:52.660 --> 22:55.299
YOU HAVE
RUSSIAN COLOR.

22:55.300 --> 22:56.949
IDO?

22:56.960 --> 23:00.657
YOU DON'T LIKE
THE BEAUTY YOU HAVE ?

23:06.260 --> 23:07.295
THE FRONT DOOR
IS OPEN.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.858
YOU CAN LEAVE
THE FLOWERS INSIDE.

23:08.860 --> 23:10.828
OKAY.

23:15.100 --> 23:18.558
OKAY, THAT IS WHERE THAT IS
GOING TO HAVE TO STAY.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.949
GOD, THAT SHIT
WAS HEAW.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.894
YOU WANTED TO HELP.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.691
OH, MY GOD,
IS THIS YOURS ?

23:28.700 --> 23:32.750
UH, NO, THAT'S NATE'S, BUT HE
KEEPS LEAVING IT IN MY CAR.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.159
I LOVE THIS BOOK !

23:34.160 --> 23:35.752
YOU READ IT ?

23:35.760 --> 23:37.227
OH, YEAH, MY FRIENDS AND I
WERE ALL OVER THIS BOOK,

23:37.230 --> 23:39.357
LIKE THREE SUMMERS AGO
BEFORE THEY ALL TURNED INTO

23:39.360 --> 23:42.090
PRETENTIOUS DRAMA NERDS
AND TOTALLY ABANDONED ME,

23:42.100 --> 23:43.351
THANK GOD.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.999
WHAT'S YOUR
FAVORITE PART ?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.195
OH, THEY'RE TOO NUMEROUS
TO MENTION.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.692
WHERE'S THAT PART WHERE SHE
STOPS SPEAKING FOR A MONTH

23:51.700 --> 23:53.656
AND JUST BARKS AT THEM ?

23:53.660 --> 23:55.321
( barking )

23:55.330 --> 23:57.389
( female )
BRENDA...

23:57.400 --> 23:58.992
BRENDA, I KNOW
YOU'RE ANGRY.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.094
( barking and growling )

24:03.930 --> 24:06.421
CAN YOU
TALK TO ME ?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.423
( growling )

24:18.330 --> 24:22.323
YOU KNOW THEY PUT ME IN THERAPY
'CAUSE I STOLE THAT FOOT ?

24:22.330 --> 24:25.458
YEAH, NATE TOLD ME.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.950
GOD, I WOULD LOVE TO GO
INTO ONE OF THOSE SESSIONS

24:26.960 --> 24:28.496
AND JUST BARK...

24:28.500 --> 24:32.721
JUST TO SEE
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE.

24:36.630 --> 24:39.428
SO, DO YOU TOTALLY IDENTIFY
WITH THIS BOOK TOO ?

24:39.430 --> 24:40.897
OF COURSE SHE DOES.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.856
IT'S ABOUT HER.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.157
WHAT ?

24:45.600 --> 24:48.091
SHE'S CHARLOTTE.

24:48.100 --> 24:50.398
YOU'RE SHITTING ME.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.857
IS HE FOR REAL ?

24:57.700 --> 24:59.053
COMPLETELY.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.652
OH, MY GOD.

25:00.660 --> 25:04.357
THIS IS LIKE MEETING
GANDHI OR JESUS.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.918
DON'T TELL ME...

25:05.930 --> 25:07.727
THE BOOK
SPOKE TO YOU.

25:07.730 --> 25:09.948
LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN
SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.521
WELL, YEAH,
IN A WAY.

25:13.530 --> 25:15.555
HAVE YOU BEEN TO
THE WEBSITE ?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.755
THERE'S A WEBSITE ?

25:17.760 --> 25:18.954
OH, YES.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.427
THERE'S A FAN CLUB.

25:20.430 --> 25:22.853
YEAH, THOSE
LONELY LITTLE GIRLS

25:22.860 --> 25:24.498
DESPERATE FOR
SOMETHING TO EMULATE

25:24.500 --> 25:26.058
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
THEY'RE NOT ORIGINAL ENOUGH

25:26.060 --> 25:28.358
TO COME UP WITH
ANYTHING ON THEIR OWN.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.453
THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO SEE,

25:30.460 --> 25:32.052
DRINKING BEFORE
SUNDOWN.

25:43.230 --> 25:44.652
HI, I'M BILLY.

25:44.660 --> 25:47.823
I'M CLAIRE.

25:47.830 --> 25:49.889
HOW DO YOU
KNOW MY SISTER ?

25:49.900 --> 25:53.199
THROUGH MY BROTHER,
NATE, THEY'RE DATING.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.828
OH, YEAH,
DATING ?

25:55.830 --> 25:57.127
LIKE WHAT,
GOING STEADY ?

25:57.130 --> 25:59.553
HE GIVE HER
HIS I.D. BRACELET ?

25:59.560 --> 26:02.358
DID SHE CARVE HIS
INITIALS IN HER ARMS

26:02.360 --> 26:04.055
SO, THEY'D BE
THERE FOREVER ?

26:07.060 --> 26:08.288
YO, BREN...

26:08.300 --> 26:10.655
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN ME
OUT ON THE OCEAN TODAY.

26:10.660 --> 26:14.596
ALL THOSE VENICE DICKS TAKING
THEMSELVES SO SERIOUSLY.

26:18.330 --> 26:19.627
YOU SURF ?

26:19.630 --> 26:21.518
ME, DO I LOOK
LIKE I SURF ?

26:21.530 --> 26:22.997
DOI?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.319
UH-OH.

26:24.930 --> 26:27.819
YOU'LL FREEZE YOUR ASS OFF
THIS TIME OF YEAR
WEARING THAT THING.

26:27.830 --> 26:29.593
SO, IT'S MY ASS.

26:29.600 --> 26:34.424
OH, FINE, YOU WANT TO GET
PNEUMONIA AGAIN GO RIGHT AHEAD.

26:36.030 --> 26:37.691
CLAIRE, I SHOULD
TAKE YOU HOME,

26:37.700 --> 26:39.099
I GOT STUFF TO DO.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.021
THAT'S ALRIGHT,
I'LL TAKE HER.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.588
GREAT.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.558
NO, I'VE GOT TIME,
WE JUST NEED TO GO RIGHT NOW.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.620
WELL, IF YOU HAVE STUFF TO DO,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

26:47.630 --> 26:49.291
YEAH, DO YOUR STUFF.

26:49.300 --> 26:52.098
I JUST HAVE TO
TAKE A SHOWER.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.298
SO, I'M WALKING
ALONG ONE DAY

27:09.300 --> 27:11.951
AND THIS ASSHOLE STOPS ME
AND ASKS ME IF I'M ALRIGHT.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.518
HE SAYS
I GOT A LOOK.

27:13.530 --> 27:16.897
HE'D SEEN A MAN WITH
THAT SAME LOOK ONCE,

27:16.900 --> 27:18.629
AND HAD IGNORED IT.

27:18.630 --> 27:23.397
AND THAT MAN HAD JUMPED
OUT A NINE-STORY WINDOW.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.994
( laughing )

27:28.400 --> 27:31.551
YOU KNOW THE RECONSTRUCTION
INVOLVED IN A DEATH LIKE THAT ?

27:33.600 --> 27:36.251
THIS BUSINESS GETS
UNDER YOUR SKIN.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.796
IT'S LIKE
A FUCKING VIRUS.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.291
YOU CAN EVEN SEE IT
ON YOUR FACE.

27:40.300 --> 27:42.325
SMELL IT ON YOU.

27:42.330 --> 27:44.651
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS PLACE ?

27:44.660 --> 27:46.457
THIS MUSIC ?

27:46.460 --> 27:49.952
SINCE WHEN DO YOU LISTEN
TO "THE CLASSICS FOUR" ?

27:51.400 --> 27:53.493
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO HERE ?

27:53.500 --> 27:54.626
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU ?

27:54.630 --> 27:55.824
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

27:55.830 --> 27:58.048
WHY COULDN'T YOU ASK THEM
WHILE I WAS STILL ALIVE ?

28:00.560 --> 28:03.893
IT'S OKAY, I COULDN'T HAVE
ANSWERED MOST OF THEM ANWVAY...

28:03.900 --> 28:06.494
UNLIKE NOW, NOW,
I'M A FUCKING PROPHET.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.422
RIGHT.

28:08.430 --> 28:10.295
YOU THINK I'M KIDDING,
BUDDY BOY ?

28:15.100 --> 28:17.295
THAT'S ONE OF THE PERKS
OF BEING DEAD.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.495
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER YOU DIE.

28:19.500 --> 28:23.254
AND YOU KNOW
THE MEANING OF LIFE.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.654
THAT SEEMS
FAIRLY USELESS.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.127
YEAH, I KNOW.

28:29.130 --> 28:31.655
LIFE IS WASTED
ON THE LIVING.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.523
YOU COULD'VE TOLD ME
YOU WERE PROUD OF ME.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.191
YOU WERE NEVER AROUND
FOR ME TO TELL.

28:40.200 --> 28:44.421
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS PROUD OF YOU FOR.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.089
THEREIN LIES
YOUR CATCH-22.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.957
SO, WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF LIFE ?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.190
YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW ?

29:02.200 --> 29:04.350
I DON'T KNOW.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.693
WILL IT FUCK ME UP
IF I DO ?

29:07.700 --> 29:10.351
( whispering )

29:57.130 --> 29:59.553
DAVID, YOU MAKE SUCH
A HANDSOME DEACON.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.425
ALL THOSE
OLD STIFFS.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.751
FINALLY A DOSE OF VIAGRA
TO THE PLACE.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.957
OH, I DON'T MEAN THAT LITERALLY,
NOT LIKE YOU'D NEED IT.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.723
AH, THANK YOU, TRACY.

30:08.730 --> 30:10.698
SO...

30:10.700 --> 30:12.952
NO FIANCEE, HUH ?

30:12.960 --> 30:15.053
UH, NO, NO,
THAT'S OVER.

30:15.060 --> 30:18.848
BUT SHE BROKE MY HEART
AND I'M JUST NOT READY

30:18.860 --> 30:21.556
OR INTERESTED IN ANY SORT
OF RELATIONSHIP NOW.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.858
OH, COME ON,
ANY RELATIONSHIP ?

30:23.860 --> 30:25.157
I'M JUST NOT READY

30:25.160 --> 30:27.890
AND I DOUBT THAT I WILL BE
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

30:27.900 --> 30:31.427
WELL, WHAT IF CINDY CRAWFORD
WERE TO WALK UP TO YOU AND SAY,

30:31.430 --> 30:34.820
"JUST USE ME FOR SEX" ?

30:34.830 --> 30:36.491
I WOULD SAY NO.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.593
LIAR.

30:45.760 --> 30:51.289
IS IT SO WRONG TO WANT
A LITTLE HUMAN CONTACT ?

30:51.300 --> 30:54.326
YOU'RE LONELY TOO.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.695
I CAN TELL.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.759
FOR CHRISSAKE,
TRACY.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.297
WHAT DOES
IT TAKE ?

31:00.300 --> 31:01.824
NO.

31:01.830 --> 31:04.993
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SO MEAN ABOUT IT.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.524
APPARENTLY I DO.

31:06.530 --> 31:07.952
LOOK, I COME HERE TO
FEED THESE PEOPLE

31:07.960 --> 31:09.689
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ANYBODY.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.918
DO US BOTH A FAVOR,
GO TO A BAR,

31:11.930 --> 31:14.626
PICK SOMEBODY UP.

31:25.060 --> 31:27.290
NO, WE JUST MET.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.949
I KNOW,
I'M SORRY.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.359
I'M JUST SO
TURNED ON BY YOU.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.419
SHUT UP.

31:37.030 --> 31:38.952
I HAVE TO GO HOME.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.120
HEY...

31:40.130 --> 31:43.349
I WANT TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.952
GOOD.

31:44.960 --> 31:48.418
BUT I'M NOT SOME SKANK
FOR YOU TO FUCK.

31:48.430 --> 31:51.729
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE INTO,

31:51.730 --> 31:53.459
JUST GO AND FIND THAT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

31:53.460 --> 31:55.599
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M INTO, CLAIRE.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.795
I SWEAR.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.723
IF YOU'RE LYING, I...

32:02.730 --> 32:05.619
SWEAR TO GOD,
I WILL KILL YOU.

32:05.630 --> 32:09.953
I WILL KICK YOUR ASS.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.758
YOU DO NOT WANT
TO MESS WITH ME.

32:59.230 --> 33:00.754
THAT AIN'T HER.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.398
EXCUSE ME ?

33:02.400 --> 33:04.721
THAT AIN'T MY WIFE,
THAT AIN'T MY HATTIE.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.550
WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH MY HATTIE ?

33:08.900 --> 33:10.049
MR. JONES,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT --

33:10.060 --> 33:12.551
I DON'T WANT YOUR RESPECT,
I WANT MY WIFE.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.189
SIR, THAT IS
YOUR WIFE.

33:19.660 --> 33:20.922
YOU MARRIED ?

33:20.930 --> 33:22.227
YES, SIR.

33:22.230 --> 33:24.824
SHE ALL YOUNG
AND PRETTY

33:24.830 --> 33:27.549
AND KNOW HOW TO
TREAT YOU RIGHT ?

33:27.560 --> 33:30.199
YES, SIR.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.196
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.259
HOW LIFE CAN BE SO GOOD
TO YOU, RIGHT ?

33:37.260 --> 33:41.754
SHE GONNA
TURN TO THAT.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.150
WE ALL DO.

33:46.160 --> 33:50.199
WELL, DON'T THAT
PISS YOU OFF, BOY ?

33:51.960 --> 33:53.689
NOT YET.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.396
HE USED THIS
HOW LONG ?

33:56.400 --> 33:58.152
SEVEN YEARS.

33:59.430 --> 34:02.888
IT'S WEIRD HOW YOU KEEP
SHOWING ME ROOMS
PEOPLE USED TO LIVE IN.

34:04.830 --> 34:06.650
I JUST THINK IT'S
SO FUCKING WEIRD

34:06.660 --> 34:08.855
HE'D SIT IN THIS SAD LITTLE ROOM
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT.

34:08.860 --> 34:12.626
WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO BE SAD ?

34:12.630 --> 34:15.326
LOOK AROUND.

34:17.160 --> 34:19.549
I THINK IT'S
FASCI NATING.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.096
REALLY, WHY ?

34:21.100 --> 34:23.557
IT'S SUCH A MYSTERY,
YOU KNOW ?

34:23.560 --> 34:26.927
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT WENT ON HERE.

34:26.930 --> 34:28.693
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.191
SO, WHAT IF
YOU DID KNOW ?

34:31.200 --> 34:33.259
HAD IT ALL
EXPLAINED TO YOU.

34:33.260 --> 34:35.649
I BET IT WOULDN'T BE NEARLY
AS INTERESTING OR FUN.

34:35.660 --> 34:38.458
YOUR FATHER WOULD BE
A LOT MORE BORING.

34:38.460 --> 34:39.859
ENJOY THIS.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.828
COME ON, DON'T YOU
PICK UP ON SOMETHING ?

34:41.830 --> 34:45.322
I THOUGHT THINGS
LEFT MARKS IN PEOPLE,

34:45.330 --> 34:46.922
IN PLACES,
IN TIME.

34:46.930 --> 34:49.251
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M A WITCH ?

34:49.260 --> 34:53.924
YOU REALLY DON'T GET ANY KIND OF
VIBE FROM THIS PLACE AT ALL ?

34:58.260 --> 35:00.558
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK ?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.854
I THINK YOUR FATHER

35:05.860 --> 35:08.226
WANTED SOMEPLACE

35:08.230 --> 35:11.427
THAT WAS JUST HIS
AND NOBODY ELSE'S.

35:16.530 --> 35:19.249
NATE, IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE,

35:19.260 --> 35:20.329
YOU NEVER WILL.

35:22.430 --> 35:24.455
I DOT WANT TO BE SOMEBODY
WHO, WHEN I DIE,

35:24.460 --> 35:25.927
NOBODY KNOWS
WHO I WAS.

35:25.930 --> 35:28.819
SO, DON'T BE.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.321
HOW YOU DOING,
MR. JONES ?

35:37.330 --> 35:39.719
I'M SITTING HERE HOLDING
MY DEAD WIFE'S HAND.

35:39.730 --> 35:42.153
HOW DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING ?

35:42.160 --> 35:45.926
WELL, YOU LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.022
OH, HELLO.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.827
FOR JONES.

35:50.830 --> 35:53.822
MR. JONES, SEE
THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS

35:53.830 --> 35:56.298
FOR YOUR WIFE'S
VIEWING TOMORROW ?

35:56.300 --> 35:58.222
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU SO EXCITED.

35:58.230 --> 36:01.028
THEY JUST GOING TO
SHRIVEL UP AND DIE.

36:02.930 --> 36:04.158
WELL, THANK YOU.

36:08.130 --> 36:10.496
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

36:19.030 --> 36:20.657
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING,

36:20.660 --> 36:23.151
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK
MY SONS TO ORDER FLOWERS

36:23.160 --> 36:25.720
FROM ANOTHER FLORIST IF
THIS BEHAVIOR CONTINUES.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.288
WHICH BEHAVIOR ?

36:27.300 --> 36:29.029
THIS IS OUR PLACE
OF BUSINESS.

36:29.030 --> 36:30.349
THERE ARE GRIEVING
PEOPLE HERE.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.523
I CAN'T HAVE YOU SKULKING AROUND
WITH THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE.

36:33.530 --> 36:35.418
WHAT LOOK ?

36:35.430 --> 36:37.853
THAT SEX LOOK.

36:37.860 --> 36:41.489
MAYBE YOU LIKE IT.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.898
LADY WEAR RED,
SHE MEAN BUSINESS.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.399
THIS IS JUST
WHAT WAS CLEAN.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.188
LADY, I CAN SEE IF IT FROM HERE,
AND I'M BLIND AND DEAF.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.089
YOU NEED TO GET
YOURSELF LAID.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.551
WHOA.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.993
TIME WARP.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.695
I TOLD YOU.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.497
IT'S PRETTY COZY...

37:46.500 --> 37:48.422
FOR A MORGUE.

37:48.430 --> 37:51.524
MUST BE WEIRD.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.350
YOU GET USED
TO IT.

37:55.260 --> 37:56.921
YOU EVER DONE IT WITH
ANYONE IN HERE ?

37:56.930 --> 37:59.990
YEAH, RIGHT, AND HAVE
MY MOTHER WALK IN ?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.251
NO.

38:01.260 --> 38:03.125
WOW, YOU LOOK GREAT.

38:03.130 --> 38:04.154
SHUT UP.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.048
COME ON, SEDUCE ME.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.028
THERE YOU GO.

38:10.030 --> 38:11.998
OH, YEAH,
THERE YOU GO.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.059
WOW, DON'T PRETEND LIKE YOU
HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE.

38:14.060 --> 38:16.119
YOU ARE A NATURAL,
LOOK AT YOU.

38:16.130 --> 38:18.394
NO, NO, DON'T HIDE.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.355
WAIT.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.525
THIS IS
WHAT YOU DO ?

38:22.530 --> 38:24.157
YOU SHOOT MODELS
AND STUFF ?

38:24.160 --> 38:25.889
HARDLY.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.927
HURRY, IT'S ON
A TIMER.

38:32.930 --> 38:34.659
( camera clicking )

38:36.500 --> 38:39.458
SOMETHING TO
REMEMBER ME BY.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.798
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
BRENDA AND YOUR BROTHER ?

38:46.800 --> 38:48.620
THINK THEY HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL ?

38:48.630 --> 38:50.825
I HOPE SO.

38:50.830 --> 38:52.798
SHE'S PRETTY
AMAZING.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.360
HE'D BE A REAL IDIOT
TO LET HER GO.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.999
THEN AGAIN, HE'S CAPABLE OF
BEING AN IDIOT SOMETIMES.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.025
YEAH, SO WHY IS SHE INTO HIM,
JUST HOT SEX ?

39:01.330 --> 39:04.026
I THINK HE'S REALLY
IN LOVE WITH HER.

39:06.330 --> 39:08.059
HOW COULD
HE NOT BE ?

39:08.060 --> 39:09.493
SHIT, I'M THIRSTY.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.899
YOU GOT ANY BEER ?

39:10.900 --> 39:13.027
NO, SORRY.

39:13.030 --> 39:15.897
THAT'S ALRIGHT, I SHOULD
BE HEADING OUT ANYWAY.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.697
UH, OKAY.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.292
I HAD FUN TODAY.

39:19.300 --> 39:20.619
ME, TOO.

39:20.630 --> 39:23.224
LET'S DO
THIS AGAIN.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.118
OKAY.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.597
( door closing )

39:33.230 --> 39:36.722
OKAY, MR. BOELSON
IS ALL JUICED UP.

39:36.730 --> 39:40.496
I'LL BE IN AT AROUND
SEVEN TOMORROW TO AIRBRUSH HIM,

39:40.500 --> 39:43.219
GET HIM READY
FOR THE VIEWING.

39:46.130 --> 39:48.018
UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO DO HIM NOW.

39:48.030 --> 39:50.089
I WAS KINDA
HOPING TO GET HOME

39:50.100 --> 39:52.489
BEFORE VAN ESSA
PUT JULIO DOWN.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.751
THAT'S FINE.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.796
GOODNIGHT.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.354
YOU NEED ANY HELP ?

40:02.360 --> 40:04.419
NO, FEDERICO.

40:04.430 --> 40:06.625
GO HOME TO
YOUR FAMILY.

40:06.630 --> 40:09.258
DON'T WORK
TOO HARD.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.460
MR. JONES...

40:44.460 --> 40:46.997
TIME TO GO HOME.

40:48.030 --> 40:49.827
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU ?

40:49.830 --> 40:50.797
I'M NATE.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.427
I WORK HERE.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.225
THAT'S MY WIFE
IN THAT BOX.

41:00.230 --> 41:01.254
I KNOW.

41:01.260 --> 41:04.195
I'M VERY SORRY.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.192
56 YEARS I SPENT SLEEPING
IN THE SAME BED WITH THAT WOMAN.

41:09.900 --> 41:14.621
56 YEARS LISTENING TO HER
TALK ABOUT THE SAME SHIT

41:14.630 --> 41:17.758
DAY IN, DAY OUT.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.921
IT'S LATE, MAYBE I SHOULD
DRIVE YOU HOME.

41:19.930 --> 41:22.956
SHUT THE FUCK UP, BOY,
AND LET AN OLD MAN SPEAK.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.848
OKAY.

41:29.730 --> 41:33.120
SHE CHASED ME ACROSS
THE FRONT YARD
WITH A STEAK KNIFE ONCE,

41:33.130 --> 41:34.950
TRIED TO
CUT MY ASS.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.952
WE SPENT CLOSE
TO A YEAR APART.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.953
THAT TIME LIKE
A HOLE IN ME NOW.

41:45.560 --> 41:49.496
SHE THE ONLY ONE
WHO REALLY KNEW ME.

41:53.230 --> 41:55.255
YOUR WIFE WILL
ALWAYS BE WITH YOU,

41:55.260 --> 41:57.091
IN YOUR MEMORIES.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.898
WHEN YOU LOVE
SOMEBODY THAT MUCH,
THEY NEVER REALLY--

41:59.900 --> 42:01.993
YOU SELL THAT SHIT TO
SOMEBODY WHO BUYING IT

42:02.000 --> 42:03.456
'CAUSE I AIN'T.

42:03.460 --> 42:06.020
YOU DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT LOVE.

42:06.030 --> 42:08.999
SOME PRETTY LITTLE THING
CATCH ES YOUR EYE

42:09.000 --> 42:11.491
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
IT'S BEEN 56 YEARS

42:11.500 --> 42:14.958
AND YOU'LL SHIT ALL OVER
YOURSELF IN A MOVIE THEATER

42:14.960 --> 42:17.394
AND SHE THE ONLY ONE
TO HELP YOU CLEAN IT UP.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.721
TH'S LOVE.

42:28.060 --> 42:30.426
YOU DON'T
KNOW NOTHING.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.819
I WON'T ARGUE THAT.

42:38.700 --> 42:40.656
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING TO DRINK ?

42:40.660 --> 42:43.049
I HAVE BEER, RED WINE,
A LITTLE VODKA.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.199
JUST WATER,
THAN KS.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.021
I DON'T USUALLY GO OUT
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT,

42:48.030 --> 42:50.658
BUT YOU KNOW HOW
IT IS SOMETIMES.

42:50.660 --> 42:52.025
YEAH.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.619
HERE YOU GO.

42:57.660 --> 42:59.025
MY EX.

42:59.030 --> 43:00.998
WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS

43:01.000 --> 43:03.252
AND THEN HE DUMPED ME
FOR A 22-YEAR-OLD STAND-IN

43:03.260 --> 43:05.353
HE MET ON LOCATION.

43:05.360 --> 43:08.090
I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY PICTURE
I HAD OF HIM I DIDN'T TEAR UP.

43:08.100 --> 43:11.456
IT'S FUNNY, YOU THINK
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY.

43:13.500 --> 43:15.821
I HEAR
HE'S IN A.A. NOW.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.622
SO, ARE YOU IN
THE BUSINESS ?

43:20.630 --> 43:22.257
AH, NO.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.989
NO, I'M A LAWYER.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.127
I'M FROM BOSTON.

43:26.130 --> 43:28.894
GOD, HOW REFRESHING.

43:29.530 --> 43:31.794
YOU TEND TO FORGET SOMETIMES
LIVING IN LA.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.997
THAT THERE'S THIS WORLD OUTSIDE
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.

43:36.430 --> 43:37.692
THAT'S THE REAL WORLD.

43:39.860 --> 43:42.124
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO ?

43:42.130 --> 43:44.553
PRODUCTION ACCOUNTING,

43:44.560 --> 43:45.492
I TOLD YOU THAT.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.899
RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.027
IT'S OKAY.

43:50.530 --> 43:52.748
SO, JIM...

43:56.000 --> 43:57.854
WHAT DO YOU
LIKE TO DO ?

44:04.460 --> 44:05.927
UM, CAN WE
SIT DOWN ?

44:05.930 --> 44:07.659
SURE.

44:12.200 --> 44:15.124
HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
TO DRINK THERE, JIM ?

44:19.260 --> 44:20.591
YOU OKAY ?

44:20.600 --> 44:21.749
YEAH.

44:58.460 --> 44:59.859
I WANT TO
APOLOGIZE

44:59.860 --> 45:01.896
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.754
IS OKAY.

45:03.760 --> 45:06.149
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LASHED OUT AT YOU LIKE THAT.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.491
IT'S JUST, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME, I--

45:07.500 --> 45:08.819
SHH.

45:10.660 --> 45:13.493
I WAS HOLDING A SAUCE PAN
THE OTHER DAY

45:13.500 --> 45:17.129
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
I REMEMBERED MAKING CREAMED CORN

45:17.130 --> 45:18.950
IN THAT PAN.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.190
SOME NIGHT WHEN IT
WAS RAINING OUTSIDE

45:21.200 --> 45:25.694
AND BOTH THE BOYS HAD COLDS
AND MY HUSBAND WAS ON A CALL,

45:25.700 --> 45:27.327
PICKING UP A BODY.

45:27.330 --> 45:29.423
AND THEN YESTERDAY I WAS
CLEANING OUT THE CABINETS

45:29.430 --> 45:32.888
AND I FOUND A JAR OF
BABY FOOD IN THE VERY BACK,

45:32.900 --> 45:36.859
STRAINED CARROTS FROM
WHEN CLAIRE WAS A BABY.

45:36.860 --> 45:41.627
THAT JAR HAD BEEN SITTING
THERE FOR OVER 15 YEARS.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.155
I AM SURROUNDED
BY THESE...

45:45.160 --> 45:47.048
TH ESE RELICS.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.426
OF A LIFE THAT
NO LONGER EXISTS.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.624
WE'RE HERE FOR
THE JONES' VIEWING.

46:09.630 --> 46:12.849
RIGHT THIS WAY,
PLEASE.

46:17.100 --> 46:18.795
( phone ringing )

46:19.960 --> 46:21.097
( Billy)
Yeah ?

46:21.100 --> 46:22.692
OH, SHIT, BILLY,
DID I WAKE YOU ?

46:22.700 --> 46:24.327
I'M SORRY, FUCK.

46:24.330 --> 46:25.991
Who is this ?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.558
IT'S CLAIRE.

46:29.330 --> 46:30.695
Who ?

46:30.700 --> 46:33.521
IT'S CLAIRE,
NATE'S SISTER.

46:35.730 --> 46:38.392
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF
MAYBE YOU WANTED TO HANG OUT

46:38.400 --> 46:40.197
AFTER SCHOOL
AGAIN TODAY.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.293
Not really.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.593
C'MON, CLAIRE,
YOU'RE WHAT, 16 ?

46:46.600 --> 46:49.922
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AM, A PEDOPHILE ?

47:16.430 --> 47:17.852
WELL ?

47:19.600 --> 47:21.989
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.628
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SAY ANYTHING,

47:24.630 --> 47:26.154
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

47:28.430 --> 47:30.193
I'VE SEEN IT.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.851
GREAT, SO, DAD TRADED
A ROOM FOR A FUNERAL.

47:32.860 --> 47:34.498
NO WONDER WE NEVER
HAD ANY MONEY.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.695
DIDN'T DAD EVER
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU

47:36.700 --> 47:38.156
ABOUT THIS
PLACE AT ALL ?

47:38.160 --> 47:40.048
DAD AND I NEVER TALKED
ABOUT ANYTHING BUT WORK.

47:40.060 --> 47:44.121
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE RELATIONSHIP
YOU AND I HAVE.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.455
NATE, PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED
TO HAVE PRIVATE LIVES.

47:48.460 --> 47:51.099
SO, WHAT IF DAD
HAD A SECRET ROOM ?
I DON'T CARE.

47:51.100 --> 47:53.022
I DON'T CARE IF HE BROUGHT
WOMEN BACK HERE TO FUCK.

47:53.030 --> 47:55.294
I DON'T CARE IF HE BROUGHT
MEN BACK HERE TO FUCK.

47:57.930 --> 48:00.194
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TELL MOM ABOUT IT ?

48:00.200 --> 48:01.895
SURE, WHY NOT ?

48:01.900 --> 48:04.551
YOU WON'T BE HAPPY UNTIL THIS
WHOLE FAMILY IS IN THERAPY.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.449
THAT'S...

48:07.460 --> 48:09.621
KIND OF A LEAP.

48:09.630 --> 48:12.724
DAVE, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
PISSED OFF ABOUT A LOT OF SHIT,

48:12.730 --> 48:14.459
BUT I DIDN'T MAKE
ANY OF THAT SHIT HAPPEN.

48:14.460 --> 48:16.428
OH, RIGHT,
I ABANDONED YOU.

48:16.430 --> 48:17.351
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

48:17.360 --> 48:18.452
I'M NOT YOUR FATHER.

48:18.460 --> 48:20.155
I'M NOT THE ONE WHOSE
RESPONSIBILITY IT WAS

48:20.160 --> 48:21.297
NOT TO ABANDON YOU.

48:21.300 --> 48:22.528
SO, JUST GET
OVER IT, PLEASE.

48:22.530 --> 48:24.725
LIFE IS JUST
TOO FUCKIN' SHORT.

48:28.300 --> 48:31.053
WELL, THANK YOU, NATE,
I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY.

48:31.060 --> 48:33.995
WRAPPED AS IT WAS, IN SUCH
A BOUQUET OF CONDESCENSION.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.594
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D PACK THIS PLACE UP,

48:36.600 --> 48:38.750
BEFORE THEY START
CHARGING US RENT.

49:36.900 --> 49:39.221
QUITE A HOTTIE, HUH ?

49:39.230 --> 49:41.425
THIS IS MOM.

49:41.430 --> 49:44.649
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BEAUTIFUL
SHE WAS, BUDDY BOY.

49:44.660 --> 49:48.824
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU WERE.

49:49.560 --> 49:51.448
I REALLY WASN'T
THAT INTERESTING.

49:51.460 --> 49:55.089
NO, I THINK YOU
PROBABLY WERE.

49:57.030 --> 50:00.227
I THINK YOU WERE THIS GREAT GUY
WHO WAS FUNNY AND WEIRD AND...

50:00.230 --> 50:02.619
HIGH.

50:05.060 --> 50:08.029
I WAS JUST ALWAYS SO AFRAID
OF EVERYTHING YOU DID...

50:08.030 --> 50:09.520
DEATH.

50:13.730 --> 50:16.858
YOU KNOW, I MADE
THE DECISION TO
COME BACK HOME

50:16.860 --> 50:18.589
TO BECOME A FUCKING UNDERTAKER
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

50:18.600 --> 50:20.420
IT WAS SOMETHING
YOU BELIEVED IN.

50:20.430 --> 50:21.829
AND NOW, I FIND OUT
YOU THINK RUNNING AWAY

50:21.830 --> 50:23.149
IS THE BEST THING
I EVER DID ?

50:23.160 --> 50:24.923
MAYBE.

50:24.930 --> 50:28.149
JESUS CHRIST, I KEPT US
FROM SELLING TO KROEHNER.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.899
AND I'M TAKING
THE FUNERAL DIRECTORS'
LICENSE TEST NEXT MONTH.

50:32.900 --> 50:36.290
MAYBE I WAS
JUST COVERING UP

50:36.300 --> 50:39.224
FOR HOW EMBARRASSED
I WAS WHEN YOU LEFT.

50:40.330 --> 50:42.525
IS THAT WHY YOU LEFT
HALF THE BUSINESS TO ME ?

50:44.630 --> 50:46.655
TO GET BACK AT ME ?

50:46.660 --> 50:48.150
MAYBE.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.754
MAYBE I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU HAD THE BALLS
TO GO AGAINST ME.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.125
OR MAYBE I REALLY
WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT.

50:52.130 --> 50:54.348
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

50:54.360 --> 50:55.827
GODDAMNIT !

50:55.830 --> 50:57.718
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
STOP FUCKING WITH ME ?!

50:57.730 --> 51:01.552
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP
CARING WHAT I THOUGHT ?

51:02.330 --> 51:04.890
( imitating Nate )
"I NEVER KNEW MY FATHER."

51:04.900 --> 51:08.722
GET OVER IT,
PLEASE.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.828
LIFE IS JUST
TOO FUCKING SHORT.

51:23.130 --> 51:26.850
MY BROTHER IS A VERY
COMPLICATED MAN.

51:26.860 --> 51:29.499
AND VERY HIGH
MAINTENANCE.

51:29.500 --> 51:32.219
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LOVE HIM DEARLY,

51:32.230 --> 51:36.155
BUT I PITY THE WOMAN
HE ENDS UP WITH.

51:36.160 --> 51:39.027
SEE, THAT'S THE SAME THING
I'D SAY ABOUT MY BROTHER.

51:39.030 --> 51:41.590
NATE IS NOT EVEN
IN THE SAME LEAGUE.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.727
WAS I CRAZY ?

51:43.730 --> 51:47.723
I MEAN, BILLY WAS
REALLY ACTING LIKE...

51:49.460 --> 51:50.859
DID YOU FUCK HIM ?

51:50.860 --> 51:53.249
NO.

51:53.260 --> 51:56.195
WELL, YOU DODGED
A BULLET THERE.

51:56.200 --> 51:59.294
IS EVERY MAN ALIVE
A TOTAL ASSHOLE ?

51:59.300 --> 52:01.359
AT SOME POINT
OR ANOTHER.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.749
THEN AGAIN
SO ARE WE.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.888
C'MON, WE GOTTA GO.

52:09.700 --> 52:11.452
I STILL CANNOT GET OVER
THE FACT THAT YOU ARE

52:11.460 --> 52:13.155
"CHARLOTTE
LIGHT AND DARK".

52:13.160 --> 52:15.253
YOU HAVE TO, BECAUSE
IT'S VERY IRRITATING.

52:22.860 --> 52:24.623
MR. JONES IS
STILL DOWNSTAIRS.

52:24.630 --> 52:26.621
I KNOW.

52:29.230 --> 52:31.494
THIS SILVER HAS BEEN IN
YOUR FATHER'S FAMILY

52:31.500 --> 52:32.819
FOR THREE GENERATIONS.

52:32.830 --> 52:35.025
I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE EVER USED IT.

52:35.030 --> 52:38.818
I'M GOING TO PUT
AN AD IN THE PAPER
AND SEE IF I CAN SELL IT.

52:38.830 --> 52:43.358
MOM, I FOUND SOMETHING
YOU PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.150
WHERE DID YOU
FIND THESE ?

53:01.160 --> 53:03.924
IN THE OFFICE,
AMONG DAD'S THINGS.

53:03.930 --> 53:07.354
LOOK AT WHAT
A CHILD I WAS.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.655
YOUR FATHER WAS
LEAVING FOR VIETNAM.

53:13.660 --> 53:16.788
HE VOLUNTEERED
AS A MEDIC.

53:16.800 --> 53:20.395
YOUR GRANDFATHER
WAS FURIOUS.

53:20.400 --> 53:23.892
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
YOUR GRANDFATHER, DO YOU ?

53:23.900 --> 53:25.856
NO.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.225
HE WAS A VERY
UNHAPPY MAN

53:29.230 --> 53:33.348
AND HE WANTED EVERYONE ELSE
TO BE UNHAPPY TOO.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.693
AND WE WERE ALL LIVING
IN THIS HOUSE.

53:40.630 --> 53:44.657
YOU WERE A BABY AND THERE
WAS NO PRIVACY SO...

53:44.660 --> 53:47.629
NATHANIEL AND I GOT
A ROOM AT A MOTEL.

53:51.230 --> 53:53.425
SOME SEEDY PLACE
IN THE VALLEY.

54:01.460 --> 54:03.997
AND WE MADE LOVE
LIKE MANIACS.

54:07.100 --> 54:09.421
LIKE IT WAS
THE LAST TIME.

54:13.900 --> 54:15.822
YOUR FATHER TOOK
THESE PICTURES,

54:15.830 --> 54:19.095
IN THAT DANK
LITTLE ROOM.

54:21.830 --> 54:25.129
TOLD ME HE KEPT THEM
IN HIS POCKET IN VIETNAM

54:25.130 --> 54:27.849
TO PROTECT HIM.

54:33.460 --> 54:36.395
IT WAS FRIGHTENING
HOW MUCH WE CHANGE.

54:44.600 --> 54:47.319
ARE YOU STAYING
FOR DINNER, DEAR ?

54:50.430 --> 54:51.590
YEAH.

54:57.530 --> 55:00.749
MR. JONES, YOU PROBABLY SHOULD
THINK ABOUT HEADING HOME.

55:00.760 --> 55:02.751
YOU'VE GOT A LONG DAY
AHEAD OF YOU TOMORROW

55:02.760 --> 55:04.022
WITH THE FUNERAL...

55:04.430 --> 55:05.954
MR. JONES ?

55:07.400 --> 55:08.753
MR. JONES.

55:15.300 --> 55:16.949
MR. JONES ?

55:19.660 --> 55:21.992
AW, SHIT.

55:34.060 --> 55:40.124
WHERE THE CARS
GO BY

55:43.100 --> 55:48.299
ALL THE DAY
AND NIGHT

56:01.400 --> 56:06.053
WHAT'S SO
WRONG TONIGHT

56:08.560 --> 56:10.790
PRAY FOR ME

56:13.060 --> 56:17.394
PRAYING FOR THE LIGHT

56:22.100 --> 56:25.957
BABY, BABY

56:28.500 --> 56:32.755
LET'S GO OUT TONIGHT

56:37.160 --> 56:42.826
WHERE THE LIGHTS
WON'T SHINE

56:45.030 --> 56:49.729
I CAN ONLY WONDER

56:55.330 --> 56:58.822
BE MINE, ALL MINE

57:03.660 --> 57:08.597
BABY,
I'LL BE GOOD
