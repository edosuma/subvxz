WEBVTT

00:18.352 --> 00:19.512
Took you long enough.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.845
Well, I had to drive from
Sheﬁdan.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.392
What's so urgent?

00:24.609 --> 00:25.894
It's out back.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.527
Someone left
hundred-dollar chips out here

00:37.747 --> 00:39.203
like a trail of breadcrumbs.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.243
Leading to what?

00:42.710 --> 00:43.825
I'll show you.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.257
The stake is mine.

00:57.475 --> 00:58.931
The flag is not.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.716
This is Gaelic.

01:01.437 --> 01:04.144
Yeah.
"Tiocfaidh ér la."

01:04.357 --> 01:06.814
It means
"Our Day Will Come."

01:07.026 --> 01:08.527
That's an IRA slogan.

01:10.029 --> 01:14.193
Yeah. And it's a
message from Boston.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.072
So why are your mob partners
threatening you?

01:19.288 --> 01:22.030
They're not my partners,
I say again.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.412
In fact, I just sent
a very clear message to them

01:25.628 --> 01:27.619
that they're not welcome
in my casino.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.965
l canceled
all the pending reservations

01:30.132 --> 01:31.872
for Manifest Destinations.

01:33.344 --> 01:36.006
This would seem to be
their response.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.509
Why did you call me?

01:40.476 --> 01:43.013
Why not call Mathias
or Malachi?

01:45.022 --> 01:46.478
Well, as you once
pointed out,

01:46.691 --> 01:49.103
my home is technically
in your county.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.903
And I don't have
complete confidence

01:55.116 --> 01:57.607
in my own security
detail right now.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.912
Why should I believe you?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.408
How do I know
you didn't just stage this

02:07.628 --> 02:11.086
like you did with
David Ridges' funeral pyre?

02:11.882 --> 02:13.543
That'd be a pretty good way
to convince me

02:13.759 --> 02:15.465
you're cutting ties
with the mob.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.635
You know, Walt...

02:19.557 --> 02:22.674
...this was not an easy call
for me to make.

02:25.563 --> 02:26.894
So what is it you want?

02:34.322 --> 02:35.858
I want protection.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.362
I want to stay alive.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.718
[Henry]
Cady, it is Henry again.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.842
I thought you were coming by
with your friend two hours ago.

03:03.059 --> 03:04.970
This is not like you.
[siren wailing]

03:05.186 --> 03:06.722
lam on my way over.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.870
-What happened here?
-Somebody got shot.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.421
Do you know who?

03:35.633 --> 03:37.965
Cops came,
took some people away.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.943
It's quiet in here.
We can talk without an audience.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.485
Did the hospital call?
ls J.P. gonna make it?

04:44.201 --> 04:45.407
We're still waiting for word.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.197
I'm sorry to make you two
go through all this again,

04:51.417 --> 04:54.534
but it's important for us to
have all of our facts straight.

04:54.754 --> 04:57.541
So if you wouldn't mind
starting at the beginning,

04:58.799 --> 05:01.711
I understand J.P. Wright was
served with a protective order.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.633
-She made me do it.
-[Cady] Asha.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.554
You really shouldn't speak
without a lawyer present.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.431
But you're my lawyer.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.308
It's a little complicated
right now.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.056
There's no need
for a lawyer.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.808
This isn't an interrogation.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.764
Nobody's under arrest.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.224
I just want to get
your statements

05:18.444 --> 05:19.650
while it's all still fresh.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.190
I'd like to make
a phone call.

05:22.615 --> 05:23.570
Go ahead.

05:23.783 --> 05:24.397
Okay.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.619
I'll -- I'll be in
the hallway, Asha.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.072
Don't say a word.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.784
[knock on door]

05:45.429 --> 05:47.966
Walt, hey.
What are you doing here?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.388
Can I come in?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.807
-Uh, yeah. Sure.
-Thanks.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.241
So, uh, you live here now?

06:07.243 --> 06:08.107
Yeah.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.321
Do you want a beer?

06:10.538 --> 06:11.744
I'd love one.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.575
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.334
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.253
80, um...

06:23.092 --> 06:26.710
I just wanted to let you know
that I hired Eamonn.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.468
What?

06:28.681 --> 06:29.796
Temporarily.

06:30.808 --> 06:31.763
What for?

06:32.434 --> 06:35.176
Well, I needed to put somebody
on a security detail

06:35.396 --> 06:37.102
at Jacob Nighthorse's house,

06:37.314 --> 06:40.272
and I can't spare you or Ferg
for that, so...

06:41.110 --> 06:44.022
Since when do we run security
for Jacob Nighthorse?

06:44.947 --> 06:47.279
Uh, since a couple hours ago.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.948
He, uh, called me
to his house

06:50.160 --> 06:51.696
and showed me a trail
of poker chips

06:51.912 --> 06:55.154
in his, uh, back field
leading to this.

06:59.378 --> 07:05.544
So, um...what do poker chips
and a flag mean, exactly?

07:06.260 --> 07:09.252
Well, uh...Nighthorse
wants me to believe

07:09.471 --> 07:11.632
it means the Irish Mob
is coming after him

07:12.433 --> 07:14.139
'cause he kicked them out
of the casino.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.682
You don't believe him?

07:16.520 --> 07:19.853
I don't know.
It's possible. Um...

07:21.692 --> 07:23.057
In fact, um...

07:23.736 --> 07:29.697
I may be kind of responsible
for the threat on his life.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.699
What did you do?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.403
Nothing, really.
Just, um...

07:37.875 --> 07:40.617
Well, I may have threatened
the head of the Irish Mob...

07:43.088 --> 07:44.077
...to his face.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.672
You did not.

07:47.635 --> 07:51.799
I told him to, uh, get out of
the casino and out of Absaroka

07:52.014 --> 07:53.629
or I'd give his name
to the FBI.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.303
So there's a mob boss
in Absaroka?

07:57.811 --> 07:58.891
No. No.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.810
You remember when I took
a couple of days off?

08:01.023 --> 08:02.934
I, um, I actually flew
to Boston.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.355
Jesus, Walt. Do you have
any idea how dangerous that was?

08:07.571 --> 08:09.311
Well, I think I'm
starting to, yeah.

08:09.531 --> 08:12.694
Why would you threaten
a mob boss ever,

08:12.910 --> 08:14.446
much less when you have
a massive lawsuit

08:14.662 --> 08:15.993
hanging over your head?

08:16.205 --> 08:19.914
It was just the, urn, the
depositions really got to me.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.706
I felt handcuffed.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.705
I couldn't make a move
without thinking

08:23.921 --> 08:26.503
how it was gonna affect that
stupid lawsuit, and | just --

08:26.840 --> 08:28.580
I just needed to act.

08:29.969 --> 08:33.257
I do realize, in retrospect,
I may have gone, uh,

08:33.889 --> 08:35.174
gone a bit too far.

08:35.391 --> 08:36.471
But, um...

08:37.685 --> 08:40.176
Well, that leads me
to my bigger concern.

08:40.396 --> 08:42.057
You have a bigger concern?

08:43.065 --> 08:44.054
Yeah.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.062
It's possible that the Irish Mob
may have put a hit out.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.316
Only they put it out on me.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.523
Jesus.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.114
ReaHy?

08:58.539 --> 09:01.076
Nighthorse and the mob
may have set this whole thing up

09:01.291 --> 09:03.668
to lure me into
a trap, kill me,

09:03.877 --> 09:06.664
and resume operations
at the casino.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.713
Okay.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.341
Okay. So...

09:15.973 --> 09:18.009
If this is true
and the mob sent a hit man

09:18.225 --> 09:19.635
to Wyoming to take you out,

09:19.852 --> 09:22.468
why don't you just turn this mob
boss over to the FBI?

09:23.397 --> 09:24.512
They can take him
into custody

09:24.732 --> 09:25.938
and take you
out of the line of fire.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.728
Because I gave my word.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.651
And because the
FBI has a leak.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.234
How else would
the mob have known

09:34.450 --> 09:36.657
when and where
to ambush Ferg?

09:38.495 --> 09:40.872
If I give this guy's name
to the FBI,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.072
he'll find out,
go into hiding,

09:43.292 --> 09:46.079
and be even more likely
to send somebody after me.

09:49.089 --> 09:49.839
Okay.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.667
So what do we do?

09:54.845 --> 09:56.710
We need to find
whoever was sent

09:57.097 --> 10:00.589
before they get the drop on me
or Nighthorse.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.928
We'll check airline manifests,
hotel rooms, rental cars...

10:06.899 --> 10:08.639
look for whoever came in
from Boston.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.224
Who are we looking for?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.143
Well, it's probably
not the boss himself.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.113
He probably sent
somebody else.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.779
-But if he didn't and --
-I can't tell you.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.782
Walt, it's gonna be a lot easier
for me to help you

10:22.998 --> 10:24.863
if I've got
all the information.

10:25.084 --> 10:28.622
Vic, the less you know
about this guy, the better.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.795
Now, I may be in trouble.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.625
But I'm not gonna risk you
getting hurt.

10:42.101 --> 10:43.762
[cellphone ringing]

10:47.314 --> 10:48.975
[clears throat]

10:52.069 --> 10:53.184
Moretti.

10:55.030 --> 10:55.985
Yeah.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.156
It's for you.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.783
[door opens]

11:04.998 --> 11:06.454
[footsteps approaching]

11:06.667 --> 11:08.999
Cady, I've been waiting
for your call.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.951
I just didn't expect it
to be about this.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.286
Mr. Morris,
what are you doing here?

11:12.506 --> 11:13.916
[Kevin]
Representing you.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.215
Is there a place where
Ms. Longmire and I can talk?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.004
Uh, privately.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.173
Come on, Asha.
Let's get some air.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.053
Mr. Nighthorse contacted me
and said you had a problem.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.765
[chuckles] He is a master
of understatement.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.395
So...
[clears throat]

11:35.445 --> 11:36.571
Talk me through what happened.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.147
-You're not my attorney.
-No.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.528
I work for Jacob Nighthorse,
and since you work for him...

11:42.744 --> 11:44.154
I'd prefer someone else.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.032
At 2:00 in the afternoon,

11:46.248 --> 11:48.330
you're not gonna find anyone in
this county half as good as me.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.576
At this hour, you're not gonna
find anybody at all.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.881
And you don't want to sleep here
among the Doritos and Slim Jims.

11:55.090 --> 11:55.954
You want to go home.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.206
Let me help you.

12:03.056 --> 12:03.886
Fine.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.682
So, did you shoot
an Indian?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.183
No. He's, um...
[clears throat]

12:12.399 --> 12:13.809
-He's a white male.
-ExceHent

12:14.026 --> 12:15.732
And where did this
white male get shot?

12:16.904 --> 12:18.360
-In the side --
-No.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.108
I mean where were you all
when it happened?

12:20.782 --> 12:23.273
Oh.
Uh, he broke into my office.

12:23.827 --> 12:24.816
You have an office?

12:25.037 --> 12:28.370
Sort of. It's an
old foreclosed house.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.406
A residence.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.369
And did you change
the C of O?

12:36.048 --> 12:37.128
No.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.081
But what does real estate
have to do with anything?

12:39.301 --> 12:40.791
Stand Your Ground.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.717
Wyoming follows
the Castle Doctrine.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.764
A man's home is his castle,
defendable against intruders.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.966
-This happened on the res.
-Doesn't matter.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.722
You're a white woman
who shot a white man.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.054
Tribal law doesn't
apply to you.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.264
Your case gets kicked
up to the state.

12:55.484 --> 12:59.068
So as long as this house belongs
to someone, you're golden.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.356
Now, who's Asha?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.953
She's a client.

13:07.162 --> 13:10.950
Uh, I served her husband
with a restraining order.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.622
He's the one
who attacked us.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.826
So she was with you
at the time.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.495
Is this wife of the victim
your only witness?

13:18.715 --> 13:21.377
I mean, will she back you up
that you acted in self-defense?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.129
We were both
being threatened.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.010
I think I saved her life.

13:26.848 --> 13:27.712
Well, that's good.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.761
I can build a Castle Doctrine
defense for sure,

13:31.436 --> 13:33.267
but it'll really help
to have the wife on your side.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.478
Do you feel like she is?

13:39.403 --> 13:40.267
I do.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.821
[clears throat]

13:47.244 --> 13:47.903
Look.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.160
I know this seems like
the worst night of your life,

13:51.373 --> 13:52.613
but as they say

13:52.833 --> 13:56.075
in the Bible or something,
"This, too, shall pass."

13:56.837 --> 13:57.622
All right.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.083
Let me see if I can spring you
for the night.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.086
-Asha.
-You killed him!

14:04.303 --> 14:05.759
Aah!

14:05.971 --> 14:08.007
-You killed J.P.!
-Asha, get off!

14:09.558 --> 14:11.094
The hospital called!

14:11.310 --> 14:13.551
He died in surgery!

14:13.770 --> 14:15.431
You murdered him!

14:16.815 --> 14:18.601
I never should've
listened to you!

14:18.817 --> 14:21.559
-Get her out of here.
-I loved him, and now he's gone!

14:21.778 --> 14:22.767
Asha, come on.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.608
[crying]
My husband is gone.

14:29.202 --> 14:29.952
[Kevin]
It's okay.

14:30.871 --> 14:31.986
It's okay.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.285
[breathing heavily]

14:38.211 --> 14:40.338
I'm not so sure
she's on your side.

14:44.593 --> 14:45.298
[Ferg] Yeah.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.341
Every passenger
in the last 72 hours

14:47.554 --> 14:49.385
whose flight originated
from Boston.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.891
Thank you.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.766
So, Walt didn't tell you
where he was going?

14:58.982 --> 15:01.598
He got a call from Henry, and he
raced off with no explanation.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.399
You know
that thing that he does.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.352
Yeah, I just --

15:06.073 --> 15:09.190
I don't understand
how we're gonna find this guy

15:09.659 --> 15:11.945
if Walt didn't tell us
his name.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.197
Name doesn't matter.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.703
Guy probably sent another guy
who works for him.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.123
But now that we got these
passenger lists coming in,

15:18.710 --> 15:20.120
we should follow up with the
local hotels

15:20.337 --> 15:21.702
and see if anybody fits
the profile.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.412
The "hit man" profile?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.254
Yeah.

15:25.842 --> 15:26.706
Sure.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.422
We'll just follow
and photograph

15:29.638 --> 15:31.629
every adult traveling
from Boston to Wyoming.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.588
Shouldn't be a problem.
[sighs]

15:33.809 --> 15:36.050
You do realize the whole
needle-in-a-haystack absurdity

15:36.269 --> 15:37.884
-of all this, don't you?
-You know what, Ferg?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.721
Just go hang out with your
girlfriend, 'cause I got this, okay?

15:40.941 --> 15:42.806
You know,
I don't mind the extra work

15:43.026 --> 15:45.017
if it gets a bull's-eye
off Walt's back, all right?

15:45.237 --> 15:46.522
Okay.
Don't bite my head off.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.569
What is with you
these days?

15:55.288 --> 15:56.789
I'm sorry.
You didn't deserve that.

15:57.874 --> 15:58.829
This is just...

15:59.793 --> 16:03.035
It's a lot, so...
[clears throat]

16:03.255 --> 16:07.999
Why don't I take all the hotels
from here to Cody

16:08.218 --> 16:10.800
and you go the other direction
towards Sheridan?

16:11.555 --> 16:12.294
Yeah.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.098
Okay.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.184
Where's Cady?
Cady Longmire.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.019
Cady Longmire's
a murderer!

16:29.239 --> 16:30.649
[Mathias]
Take her back to my office.

16:31.575 --> 16:32.985
Cady's in
the interview room.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.452
My daughter under arrest?

16:34.661 --> 16:35.821
No. She's just giving
a statement.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.235
I'm taking her home.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.281
| just took him
to the hospital

16:40.500 --> 16:41.740
thinking his daughter
had been shot.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.581
I've had my hands full
with this.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.503
It's not often a white girl
shoots a white guy on the res.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.914
After all I have done
for you.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.876
All you've done is the minimum
required to save your ass.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.964
That doesn't earn you special
treatment.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.136
I still have a job to do.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.555
Get your hands off her.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.386
-Dad, it's okay.
-No, it's not.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.188
-Now, you leave her alone.
-Dad, stop.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.606
They got no right, Cady.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.275
Actually, they do, because
I shot and I killed a man.

17:09.488 --> 17:11.729
Whoa. I'm not sure you need to
be saying anything like that.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.735
-Who's he?
-l'm her lawyer. Kevin Morris.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.407
I represent
Jacob Nighthorse's concerns.

17:16.620 --> 17:18.451
He sent me
when, uh, Cady called.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.871
[Mathias]
You get everything you need?
[man] Yes, sir.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.415
Then you're free to go.
We'll be in touch tomorrow.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.458
[Kevin] You need a ride, Cady?
-No.

17:28.507 --> 17:29.747
No, I'll take her home.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.982
[woman] We did have a man
check in from Boston.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.984
Joe Bauman.
Oh, he just went out.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.986
You could probably catch him
in the parking lot.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.067
He's in a white
Chevy Malibu.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.276
Thanks.

18:10.674 --> 18:11.504
[engine starts]

18:29.067 --> 18:29.726
[camera shutter clicks]

18:40.287 --> 18:43.825
[man] Give me a fish fillet,
no mayonnaise, no bun.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.749
You have caffeine-free Slice?
What-- That's fine. That'll do.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.292
No french fries.

18:49.504 --> 18:50.584
Cool. Thank you.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.378
ﬁhud]

18:52.591 --> 18:54.252
What the hell?!
This is a rental!

18:54.467 --> 18:55.877
Sorry!
My bad.

18:59.848 --> 19:01.759
[shutter clicking]

19:02.601 --> 19:04.432
-Need a bag?
-All good.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.467
Thanks.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.893
Can I help you?

19:11.735 --> 19:13.976
Uh, yeah.
Just right behind you.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.277
You want some condoms?

19:17.991 --> 19:20.482
No, um...beneath the...

19:21.036 --> 19:21.821
[clicks tongue]

19:22.621 --> 19:23.952
The pregnancy test?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.405
Could you say it
any louder?

19:28.043 --> 19:28.953
[spits]

19:55.195 --> 19:56.230
Made you some tea.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.936
Oh.
Uh, thank you.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.191
Yeah.
It's hot.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.694
I really appreciate
you taking me home, Dad.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.245
So, why didn't you call me?

20:14.506 --> 20:15.245
What?

20:18.635 --> 20:21.001
Oh. Uh, well, the shooting
happened on the res.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.133
So it made sense
to call Jacob.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.465
Jacob's the one who put you
in danger in the first place.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.058
That's what he does.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.728
He lures people into situations
where they get hurt,

20:34.025 --> 20:37.483
and, uh... nobody can
ever tie him to it.

20:37.696 --> 20:38.981
Well, you can stop
blaming Jacob,

20:39.197 --> 20:42.109
because it was J.P. Wright
who attacked me.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.779
And I'm -- I'm lucky
that I had Jacob's gun.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.656
Nighthorse gave you a gun?

20:51.376 --> 20:53.162
So he knew
he was putting you at risk.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.123
It's a Cheyenne
gesture of trust.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.464
Something that you could use
a little bit more of.

21:01.261 --> 21:05.675
Don't be so naive, Cady.
Nighthorse is not your friend.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.389
He's the last one
you should count on.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.557
I wanted to count on you.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.686
I asked you to help me serve
that restraining order

21:17.902 --> 21:20.939
against J.P. Wright,
and you turned me down.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.107
You told me to quit.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.699
Well, if you listened to me,
none of this would've happened.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.416
Okay. Um...

21:33.752 --> 21:36.960
I'm really tired, Dad.
Okay?

21:37.172 --> 21:38.753
I just want to go to sleep.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.168
Okay?

21:41.676 --> 21:42.381
Okay.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.018
Okay.

22:16.044 --> 22:17.534
Cady, it is Henry.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.332
Just checking to see
how you are feeling this morning

22:20.799 --> 22:23.541
and to find out when would be
a good time to come by later.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.050
I may have a gift for you...

22:27.263 --> 22:29.470
...if I can find
what I am looking for.

22:30.975 --> 22:31.964
Let me know.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.185
[sighs]

23:53.308 --> 23:54.593
[sighs]

23:55.476 --> 23:56.226
[door closes]

23:56.853 --> 23:59.765
You look rough.
What happened last night?

24:00.398 --> 24:01.808
Oh. Um...

24:03.985 --> 24:07.898
There was an incident
at, um, Cady's office.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.194
[liquid pouring]

24:09.407 --> 24:10.908
What type of incident?

24:12.201 --> 24:13.156
A shooting.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.033
Cady shot a guy in self-defense.

24:23.171 --> 24:25.753
You come up with any leads
on hit men

24:25.965 --> 24:27.045
coming in from Boston?

24:28.426 --> 24:29.666
Cady shot a guy?

24:29.886 --> 24:31.092
-Is she okay?
-She's fine.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.714
She shot him.

24:35.558 --> 24:38.300
So, what'd you learn
last night?

24:38.519 --> 24:41.010
So, we got flight manifests
from Range Air

24:41.230 --> 24:44.063
and Frontier out of Sheridan

24:44.275 --> 24:48.439
and all other major airlines
and charters out of Cody.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.862
[Vic] We tracked a number
of Boston-based passengers

24:51.074 --> 24:53.235
to local hotels and photographed
as many of them as we could.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.494
Does anyone look familiar?

24:56.329 --> 24:58.911
Of course, none of these include
anyone who's staying with family

24:59.123 --> 25:02.081
or came in by bus or car.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.286
Who's this?

25:08.549 --> 25:10.130
Can't make out a face.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.425
Oh, I caught him
just before he went inside.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.593
Um, Dennis Wabash.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.509
Boston to Minneapolis
to Sheridan.

25:22.230 --> 25:26.269
Dennis Wabash is
Jacob Blankenship's old cohort.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.645
Who's Jacob Blankenship?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.647
Jacob Nighthorse
before he changed his name.

25:31.781 --> 25:35.399
According to Jacob's records,
Dennis Wabash committed suicide.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.949
Thirty years ago.

25:37.161 --> 25:40.324
So either Dennis Wabash
isn't really dead

25:41.040 --> 25:43.281
or someone else from Boston
is traveling

25:43.501 --> 25:45.082
using a dead man as an alias.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.205
A dead man
connected to Nighthorse.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.038
Where's Dennis staying, Ferg?

25:50.258 --> 25:52.374
Peaksman Motel in Sheridan.

25:52.593 --> 25:53.878
I'm heading to Sheridan.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.343
I don't think
that's a very good idea.

25:56.556 --> 25:57.466
l have to.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.556
If he's come from Boston
and he's who I think he is,

26:00.768 --> 26:02.804
he clearly didn't get my
message the first time.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.012
And you're clearly
not getting his.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.894
Oh, I'm getting his message.
I just don't care for it.

26:12.363 --> 26:15.275
You two head home.
Get some rest.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.407
[door closes]

26:30.173 --> 26:33.415
Hold it right there!
You're on private property.

26:35.595 --> 26:39.304
Easy. I am just here
to see Jacob Nighthorse.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.504
What's in the bag?

26:41.601 --> 26:43.262
Who exactly are you?

26:43.478 --> 26:45.560
-l'm with
the Sheriff's Department.
-No, you are not.

26:45.772 --> 26:46.978
I know everyone
in that department.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.226
I'm a temp.
What's in the bag?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.354
What is in the bag
is private.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.982
You don't want to show me?
That's fine.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.529
Turn around.
Get on the ground.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.653
Turn around
and get on the ground!

26:59.869 --> 27:01.075
Right now,
on your knees.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.404
Get down.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.907
Hey.
There you are.

27:42.537 --> 27:43.617
Hi.

27:43.830 --> 27:47.322
Mandy, uh...
what's going on?

27:47.542 --> 27:50.750
l was walking past, and there
were all these people outside,

27:50.962 --> 27:53.044
-so I let them in.
-How did you get in?

27:53.714 --> 27:56.842
Broken window.
Yo, you should really fix that.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.588
Why are all these people
here?

27:59.804 --> 28:01.886
Well, word spread
that you killed a white man.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.637
It means
you can't be all bad.

28:05.143 --> 28:07.976
Yeah. People are taking you
more seriously now.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.428
Oh, l-l took $20
from each of them.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.639
That's like
a retainer, right?

28:12.859 --> 28:14.645
No, no, no.
You have to give that back.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.476
This is a nonprofit
legal-aid center.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.027
Free is insulting.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.524
If you don't charge them,

28:19.740 --> 28:21.822
people will think you're giving
them shitty service.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.863
I, uh...

28:25.705 --> 28:27.787
l-l need a --
I need a minute.

28:33.796 --> 28:34.785
Excuse me.

28:35.548 --> 28:38.005
[woman] You want me to write
down everything he did to me?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.423
[Mandy]
Mm-hmm. Yep.

28:44.432 --> 28:47.219
Okay. So, we got a couple DUIs,
some child-custody cases,

28:47.435 --> 28:49.471
and a guy who wants to sue
the federal government.

28:50.188 --> 28:51.519
This isn't what I wanted.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.847
Going from having no clients
to a full house?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.192
No, l --

28:57.028 --> 28:58.814
I mean,
l-l want to help people,

28:59.030 --> 29:00.270
but I didn't want
to have to kill a man

29:01.032 --> 29:02.192
to raise my reputation.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.488
Okay.

29:03.701 --> 29:06.534
Well, you can't put that
toothpaste back in the tube.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.613
So, who do you
want to see first?

29:14.295 --> 29:15.080
I can't.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.298
Tell them to come back
tomorrow.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.627
Henry Standing Bear.
He says he knows you.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.428
But he was on the premises
without permission

29:26.641 --> 29:29.053
-and wouldn't cooperate.
-I have been racially profiled.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.054
I didn't profile you.
You were acting suspicious.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.555
That's all right, Eamonn.
I know him.

29:33.898 --> 29:35.729
Will you give us
a moment, please?

29:43.908 --> 29:45.318
What is that guy
doing here, Jacob?

29:45.534 --> 29:46.819
Walt sent him over.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.781
-Walt Longmire?
-Yeah.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.158
You're the one that gave me
the idea to reach out to him

29:52.375 --> 29:55.242
to help deal with the
threat of the mob.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.628
I am beginning
to regret that.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.171
Yeah?

30:02.009 --> 30:05.046
What were you doing out there
to make Eamonn suspicious?

30:06.889 --> 30:08.470
Bringing you good news.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.800
I found Malachi's second set
of financial records

30:12.019 --> 30:12.883
for the Red Pony.

30:13.854 --> 30:17.563
As I suspected,
it tells a very different story.

31:16.834 --> 31:19.371
[humming, clapping]

31:24.216 --> 31:26.628
N I know If

31:32.099 --> 31:37.014
J‘J‘ Know you ain't no saint J‘J‘

31:39.565 --> 31:44.559
J‘J‘ And I won't be M

31:45.529 --> 31:49.147
J‘J‘ Calling out your name if

31:51.660 --> 31:54.037
[beeping]

31:54.747 --> 32:00.617
J‘J‘ And, oh, Lord, it's dirt J‘J‘

32:02.463 --> 32:08.174
J‘J‘ It's been dirt before J‘J‘

32:09.804 --> 32:15.765
U Know all you're doing J‘J‘

32:15.976 --> 32:20.390
N Is dragging it
across my floor J‘J‘

32:25.486 --> 32:31.482
J‘J‘ And let M

32:31.700 --> 32:35.568
J‘J‘ Let my dogs lie J‘J‘

32:35.788 --> 32:38.495
[microwave beeping]

32:54.390 --> 32:57.006
[beer sloshing]

32:59.437 --> 33:01.519
[country music playing]

33:14.994 --> 33:16.985
Wow.
I'm sorry.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.865
If I'd known
you'd be showing up here,

33:19.081 --> 33:20.537
I would've brought
some lobsters.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.660
[silverware clinks]
In exchange for the trout.

33:22.877 --> 33:25.038
They were delicious,
by the way.

33:25.254 --> 33:29.247
I prepared them with an almond
crust, a little lemon. Mmm.

33:29.467 --> 33:32.550
Well, if you weren't expecting
me, who were you expecting?

33:33.220 --> 33:34.551
An old friend.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.306
Jacob Blankenship?

33:37.183 --> 33:39.219
You're a man who knows
his history.

33:39.435 --> 33:41.426
That's a name I haven't heard
in 30 years.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.478
That's about the time
that Jacob was hanging out

33:44.690 --> 33:45.975
with Dennis Wabash.

33:47.318 --> 33:50.185
And that's the name you used
to check in to that motel.

33:51.322 --> 33:52.277
Huh.

33:52.490 --> 33:53.900
Clearly you all knew
each other.

33:54.116 --> 33:55.401
We did.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.574
We were all college radicals.

33:58.496 --> 34:01.613
Bonded over the fact that we had
all lost our countries

34:02.708 --> 34:04.414
to colonizing assholes.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.581
But that was all
a very long time ago.

34:08.214 --> 34:11.581
I've moved on
from that naive idealism

34:11.800 --> 34:14.837
to a more effective
pragmatism.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.170
I can tell you the whole
boring story if you want.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.640
There's no need.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.014
You're leaving.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.138
I told you to stay out
of my county.

34:23.354 --> 34:26.016
I'm not in your county.
This is Sheridan.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.436
Named after an Irish general --
Philip Sheridan.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.977
Kind of a
bad guy, actually.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.437
He's credited with saying,

34:34.657 --> 34:36.397
"The only good Indian
is a dead Indian."

34:38.118 --> 34:39.858
I know one Indian who
believes you're here

34:40.079 --> 34:41.068
to make sure he's dead.

34:43.958 --> 34:47.041
Nighthorse thinks you put that
in his garden as a warning.

34:48.546 --> 34:50.582
A little theatrical,
don't you think?

34:51.799 --> 34:55.132
Tell me, Sheriff, when you're
about to go after a suspect,

34:55.344 --> 34:58.302
do you send a singing
telegram to tip him off?

34:59.265 --> 35:00.721
Please, sit.

35:02.059 --> 35:04.141
You're making
the waitress nervous.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.271
Jacob's a friend of mine.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.401
Why would I want him dead?

35:16.282 --> 35:18.113
Because he pulled out
of your business arrangement

35:18.325 --> 35:19.235
at the casino.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.653
He canceled all the reservations
for Manifest Destinations.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.123
I wasn't aware of that.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.742
In fact, I'm the one
who pulled out of the casino,

35:29.962 --> 35:31.327
just as you and I agreed.

35:32.172 --> 35:32.922
Do we agree?

35:33.132 --> 35:35.373
Well, no.
I suppose not formally.

35:35.593 --> 35:38.460
But after your visit, I did
a profit-and-Ioss analysis,

35:38.679 --> 35:40.465
something I do
on a regular basis.

35:41.515 --> 35:42.755
And I agreed with you.

35:43.726 --> 35:45.262
There are hundreds
of shitty little casinos

35:45.477 --> 35:48.093
all across this
great country of ours

35:48.314 --> 35:51.681
that don't come encumbered
with Indian ghost vigilantes

35:51.900 --> 35:53.310
and crusading sheriffs.

35:55.112 --> 35:58.821
The potential profits in
Absaroka aren't worth the risk.

36:00.576 --> 36:05.616
So, one conversation and you
fly out here under a fake name

36:05.831 --> 36:07.116
to shut up shop?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.205
Your colleagues
back in Boston

36:09.418 --> 36:11.454
must think you're being
a little rash.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.002
No.
Decisive.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.543
The mistake a lot of people make
in this business

36:17.760 --> 36:21.673
is they can't separate
their emotions from business.

36:22.389 --> 36:26.177
That's what often makes endings
so drawn out and messy

36:26.810 --> 36:27.925
and expensive.

36:28.437 --> 36:31.474
People get caught up in cycles
of vendetta, violence

36:31.690 --> 36:34.022
that are really
just about injured pride.

36:35.194 --> 36:39.233
I came out here to make sure
none of that happened.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.359
How did Nighthorse
take it?

36:41.575 --> 36:44.032
Oh, I'm sure
he's not happy.

36:44.244 --> 36:47.486
How much money does a man need?
He's prospering.

36:48.248 --> 36:53.333
And, full disclosure, I did have
another reason to come out here.

36:53.837 --> 36:54.872
What's that?

36:55.673 --> 36:59.336
Wanted to make sure if I hold up
my end of the bargain...

37:00.886 --> 37:02.387
you'll hold up yours.

37:03.806 --> 37:05.387
I gave you my word.

37:06.433 --> 37:09.766
And my gut says
you're a trustworthy man.

37:09.978 --> 37:14.187
But again, I have to separate
my emotions from my business.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.557
It's like Ronald Reagan
used to say

37:16.777 --> 37:18.438
about negotiating
with the Russians.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.150
"Trust but verify."

37:23.283 --> 37:24.784
So you're a
history buff, too.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.199
Mm.

37:26.495 --> 37:32.456
So I have made a clean break
with Four Arrows Casino, and...

37:33.210 --> 37:35.246
I've taken care
of Eddie Harp.

37:37.965 --> 37:40.798
No risk of him getting
chatty with the FBI.

37:42.344 --> 37:46.963
Now I need assurances
that you won't either.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.304
So you didn't come out
here to kill me?

37:53.897 --> 37:55.933
Just here to make sure
I don't talk.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.025
So long as I have nothing
to worry about from you,

38:00.237 --> 38:04.105
you have nothing to
worry about from me.

38:05.159 --> 38:07.070
Neither does
your daughter, Cady...

38:08.454 --> 38:11.912
or your friend
Mr. Standing Bear...

38:13.041 --> 38:15.032
or that deputy of yours.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.326
The cute one.

38:18.088 --> 38:19.123
Moretti.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.002
I'm guessing she's the one
you gave that envelope to,

38:26.930 --> 38:28.761
I don't like
being threatened.

38:29.391 --> 38:32.303
Well, to be fair...

38:33.687 --> 38:34.927
...you started it.

38:37.191 --> 38:38.647
Evidence.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.811
You can never be
too careful.

38:46.408 --> 38:47.614
[woman] Hi.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.906
I'm sorry, Mr. Wabash,

38:49.119 --> 38:50.575
but there's no smoking
allowed in here.

38:50.788 --> 38:53.746
I'm sorry, Cindy.
It will not happen again.

38:58.045 --> 38:59.876
People are so nice here.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.879
Shame I have to leave.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.212
But a deal's a deal,
right, Sheriff?

39:26.240 --> 39:27.104
Asha.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.069
No, Asha, wait.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.367
Wait, please!
I really need to speak with you.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.832
[Henry] Hello?
Hey.

39:43.674 --> 39:44.789
ls Malachi there
right now?

39:46.134 --> 39:47.635
No, he is not.

39:47.845 --> 39:50.006
I have not seen Malachi
in a couple of days, actually.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.679
Do you think he knows
that the ledger is missing?

39:52.891 --> 39:55.724
No.
And he never will.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.058
Good.

40:02.693 --> 40:04.274
I'm gonna have to
call you back, Henry.

40:09.616 --> 40:11.026
So, what's up, gentlemen?

40:11.243 --> 40:12.653
Where you --
Where you guys going?

40:13.495 --> 40:15.986
I'm taking Eamonn
off this security detail.

40:17.291 --> 40:18.701
There's no threat
against your life.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.294
I just got back
from talking with your friend,

40:22.045 --> 40:24.127
the one who called himself
Dennis Wabash.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.748
He says he ended
your business arrangement.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.334
So it seems that if anybody
would be likely to kill,

40:30.554 --> 40:32.419
-it would most probably be you.
-Okay.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.848
"Dennis Wabash" called
me at work

40:37.060 --> 40:39.016
asking to meet
at a Sheridan motel.

40:39.688 --> 40:41.019
A call from a dead man.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.021
If that's not a threat,
I don't know what it is.

40:43.233 --> 40:46.020
-He's lying to you, Walt.
-No. No, you are.

40:47.029 --> 40:48.610
First, you neglect to tell me
you were old friends

40:48.822 --> 40:49.937
with an Irish Mob boss.

40:50.157 --> 40:51.613
Then you leave out the fact

40:51.825 --> 40:54.191
that he's here in town
trying to contact you, Jacob.

40:54.995 --> 40:58.408
You know, honestly,
I'm tired of your denials

40:58.624 --> 41:00.410
about your arrangements
with organized crime.

41:00.626 --> 41:01.490
I'm done.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.960
There is no arrangement!

41:05.547 --> 41:07.754
I don't know what I have to do
to get through to you.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.416
He and l were friends
decades ago.

41:11.511 --> 41:15.174
Yes, the IRA
and the American Indian movement

41:15.390 --> 41:17.005
had common cause.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.887
Both of us were trying to
overthrow our occupiers.

41:20.103 --> 41:23.766
But I left all of that behind
after Dennis killed himself.

41:24.191 --> 41:26.898
When my friend
contacted me a year ago

41:27.110 --> 41:28.896
to suggest a partnership
with the casino,

41:29.196 --> 41:33.189
I flew out to Foxwoods
specifically to tell him no.

41:33.408 --> 41:36.024
You yourself saw me getting off
the plane when I got back!

41:36.244 --> 41:40.112
Nobody flies all the way across
the country to tell someone no.

41:40.332 --> 41:43.790
Your friend was operating
out of Four Arrows,

41:44.002 --> 41:47.460
pouring heroin into Absaroka,
my county!

41:47.673 --> 41:49.664
Now, he's only just
pulled out now

41:49.883 --> 41:51.965
because I threatened to give
his name to the FBI.

41:52.177 --> 41:55.260
Good God!
The great white ego rides again.

41:55.472 --> 41:57.212
You're the reason he's leaving.
Is that it, Walt?

41:57.432 --> 41:59.639
That's right!
And I think you knew that.

41:59.851 --> 42:00.636
That's wrong!

42:00.852 --> 42:02.638
So there is no threat
against your life.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.810
I think you arranged
this whole thing

42:05.023 --> 42:07.560
just to get me out of the way
so you could resume

42:07.776 --> 42:10.267
your profitable arrangement
with your old friend.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.773
Even for you,
that is ridiculous!

42:12.990 --> 42:15.151
Okay. Uh, you guys obviously
have some stuff to work out,

42:15.367 --> 42:16.573
so I'm gonna go wait in the car.

42:17.995 --> 42:20.327
[gunfire]
Aah!

42:36.930 --> 42:39.342
[gunfire continues]

42:49.317 --> 42:50.272
Cover me!

42:50.485 --> 42:52.646
[gunshots]

42:57.868 --> 42:58.607
Walt!

42:59.327 --> 43:00.282
Get back!

43:01.413 --> 43:02.653
Walt!

43:07.085 --> 43:07.835
You all right?

43:08.378 --> 43:09.242
Been better.

43:09.463 --> 43:12.125
[grunting]

43:13.967 --> 43:15.298
I'll get you out of here.

43:16.678 --> 43:18.964
Next time you're thinking of
calling me for a favor,

43:19.181 --> 43:20.216
please don't.

43:21.767 --> 43:23.098
Pull him up!
Aah!

43:23.310 --> 43:25.972
[groaning]

43:39.868 --> 43:41.608
What happened?
Are you okay?

43:41.828 --> 43:44.661
Uh, yeah. There was,
uh, there was a hit.

43:45.749 --> 43:47.705
I don't know if I was the target
or -- or Nighthorse,

43:47.918 --> 43:50.409
but, uh, Eamonn caught
one of the bullets.

43:50.796 --> 43:51.911
Eamonn did?

43:52.214 --> 43:53.454
Yeah.
He got hit in the leg.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.925
Lost a lot of blood,
but he's okay.

43:56.635 --> 43:59.251
Doctor said you could
go see him if you want.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.546
Did you follow them? The shooters?
Did you see them?

44:02.766 --> 44:05.098
l was taking care of Eamonn,
but Nighthorse ran after them.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.345
He couldn't catch them.

44:06.561 --> 44:07.391
Whoever they were,

44:07.604 --> 44:09.435
I guess we're lucky
that they have shitty aim.

44:12.567 --> 44:14.899
You should, um, go see
your, um...

44:15.403 --> 44:16.688
Go see Eamonn.

44:16.905 --> 44:18.270
I should get back over
to Nighthorse's,

44:18.490 --> 44:19.980
make sure nobody disturbs
the crime scene.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.531
Do you think
that we're dating?

44:22.577 --> 44:23.692
Me and Eamonn.

44:25.288 --> 44:26.277
You said you were.

44:27.749 --> 44:30.536
Not dating, exactly, but...
I just figured --

44:30.752 --> 44:32.128
Uh, yeah, 'cause we're not.

44:33.630 --> 44:34.289
Okay.

44:35.465 --> 44:36.250
Um...

44:37.509 --> 44:38.669
So you don't
want to see him?

44:39.261 --> 44:40.751
Oh, I'm gonna go see him.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.756
Right. I guess I'll
see you later.

45:04.077 --> 45:04.736
[knock on door]

45:07.497 --> 45:08.612
You decent?

45:09.082 --> 45:10.367
Not if I stand up.

45:12.836 --> 45:15.077
Your boss is so jealous,
he tried to kill me.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.546
Aren't you
supposed to be resting?

45:19.259 --> 45:21.545
Well, since I have
some downtime,

45:21.761 --> 45:27.051
I'm taking the chance to look up
some career alternatives.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.852
Jobs where you don't
get shot.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.347
Yeah.
Yeah.

45:32.564 --> 45:34.600
So everything in law enforcement
is out, of course.

45:34.816 --> 45:38.354
I thought maybe I'd go back
to medical school, but look.

45:38.570 --> 45:41.607
"Crazed meth head
shoots up emergency room."

45:41.823 --> 45:45.236
Then I thought
maybe I'll work with children.

45:46.953 --> 45:49.365
"Fifth grader brings Uzi
to class."

45:50.832 --> 45:52.663
It's good you're thinking about
your future.

45:56.546 --> 45:59.379
I have been, too...actually.

45:59.591 --> 46:02.833
And what we talked about
at the -- the Red Pony,

46:03.053 --> 46:05.840
that I needed to figure out
what was going on with me

46:06.056 --> 46:07.262
before there could be an us.

46:08.141 --> 46:10.757
Oh, you figured all that out?
That was pretty quick.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.938
Well, it's been six weeks,
you know?

46:14.898 --> 46:19.938
Six and a half, seven.
Uh...anyway, yeah.

46:20.153 --> 46:22.519
l have been thinking about
what I want.

46:22.739 --> 46:25.105
"Dentist shot in Dallas."

46:26.034 --> 46:26.739
Eamonn, please.

46:28.703 --> 46:29.453
Yeah.

46:34.167 --> 46:36.078
So, uh...
I guess I was wondering,

46:36.294 --> 46:38.410
now that you, uh,
you don't work

46:38.630 --> 46:40.586
for the Cumberland County
Sheriff's Department anymore

46:40.799 --> 46:43.381
if you were gonna be hanging
around.

46:46.429 --> 46:47.544
Do you want me to?

46:51.142 --> 46:52.348
I want to know
what you want.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.103
I don't know.

47:02.195 --> 47:03.275
I think maybe it's time
to move on.

47:03.488 --> 47:08.027
And I haven't...
had the best luck here.

47:12.205 --> 47:15.789
But can we not talk
about this now?

47:16.001 --> 47:18.413
Because I don't think
I'm supposed to make

47:18.628 --> 47:21.586
any big decisions
while I'm flying on painkillers.

47:23.717 --> 47:26.880
You know.
And besides, what's the hurry?

47:36.021 --> 47:37.977
You know, I can't believe I'm
saying this,

47:38.648 --> 47:39.558
but I'm starting to think

47:39.774 --> 47:41.355
that Nighthorse
was telling the truth.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.315
Well, you did say
that he returned fire.

47:47.657 --> 47:50.865
Hardly makes sense for him to do
that if he was setting you up.

47:51.703 --> 47:52.488
Yep.

47:53.288 --> 47:55.495
And he pursued the shooters
all the way back here.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.456
Sheriff, here.

48:06.593 --> 48:08.504
That's a nice direct
line of sight.

48:10.847 --> 48:13.680
So you're thinking
this really was the mob?

48:19.314 --> 48:21.350
How many men attacked
you on the road?

48:23.151 --> 48:23.856
Eight.

48:26.613 --> 48:27.443
Eight.

48:31.910 --> 48:33.616
[footsteps approaching]

48:37.374 --> 48:38.409
I need a favor.

48:39.334 --> 48:40.915
I want Cady's rifle back.

48:41.378 --> 48:42.834
No can do.
It's evidence.

48:43.004 --> 48:46.087
You are not required to hold
a weapon used in self-defense.

48:48.009 --> 48:50.466
So you're a lawyer now
on top of being Hector?

48:54.474 --> 48:56.635
I have done you a lot of favors,
Mathias.

48:57.977 --> 49:00.138
I am now asking you for one.

49:02.732 --> 49:05.223
[grumbles]

49:08.947 --> 49:11.359
What are you gonna do
with it?

49:11.574 --> 49:13.565
Return it
to its rightful owner.

49:13.785 --> 49:15.650
You might want to hang on to it
yourself.

49:15.870 --> 49:17.986
I've heard rumors that there's
a bounty on Hector's head.

49:18.206 --> 49:19.321
Are you aware of this?

49:19.541 --> 49:20.997
Why do you think I have been
laying low?

49:21.209 --> 49:22.949
The bounty
is up to $20,000.

49:24.129 --> 49:25.289
For that much money,

49:25.505 --> 49:28.087
I might start thinking about
killing you.

49:28.299 --> 49:30.790
That is not funny.
Sure it is.

49:31.010 --> 49:34.298
So, you have any idea
who wants Hector dead?

49:34.514 --> 49:36.095
No.

49:36.307 --> 49:39.515
But I do know someone who will
want Henry dead pretty soon.

49:39.727 --> 49:41.763
Why?
What'd you do this time?

49:42.814 --> 49:45.305
It does not concern you.
Thank you for this.

49:46.734 --> 49:49.396
And now you owe me
another favor.

49:54.075 --> 49:58.068
There were two dozen casings
in the woods, all in one pile.

49:58.288 --> 50:02.122
Compared to 90 casings
where Eddie Harp was taken,

50:02.333 --> 50:03.914
scattered all over
the pavement.

50:04.836 --> 50:08.454
The mob sent eight men
to extract Eddie.

50:08.673 --> 50:10.629
Now, as far as I can tell,
there was just one shooter

50:10.842 --> 50:14.710
sent to Nighthorse's house
to kill either him or me.

50:15.597 --> 50:18.430
This mob boss would never send
one guy for this job.

50:18.641 --> 50:22.554
He's careful.
He likes to minimize his risk.

50:23.062 --> 50:24.472
I know that much about him.

50:24.689 --> 50:26.805
So you don't think
the attack at Nighthorse's house

50:27.025 --> 50:28.060
was a mob hit.

50:28.276 --> 50:30.187
It just doesn't fit
their style.

50:30.403 --> 50:34.271
Plus, Nighthorse said he never
had a deal with the mob.

50:36.910 --> 50:39.276
Even though the mob swears
they did.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.454
So which one's lying?

50:45.668 --> 50:47.954
Maybe neither of them
is lying.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.416
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

50:54.636 --> 50:57.002
Ah.
I'm looking for Ms. Longmire.

51:01.017 --> 51:03.508
So if you could just take
this home and get the same --

51:03.728 --> 51:05.389
Some douchebag
here to see you.

51:10.944 --> 51:13.481
Um, and just take this home
and get it signed for me.

51:13.696 --> 51:15.812
Uh, we can talk more about it
tomorrow, Mr. Howling Bull.

51:16.032 --> 51:17.192
Oh, o-okay.
Okay?

51:17.408 --> 51:19.490
All right. Thank you.
Thank you.

51:22.247 --> 51:23.737
Charming employee.

51:23.957 --> 51:27.870
Yeah, she kind of hired herself.
What do you want?

51:28.086 --> 51:30.873
Just to see you smile.
And to brag a little bit.

51:31.089 --> 51:33.375
The district attorney went for
my Castle Doctrine argument.

51:33.591 --> 51:34.580
He signed off this morning.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.007
There won't be any charges
against you.

51:37.220 --> 51:38.960
You're good to go.

51:39.180 --> 51:41.091
That's it.

51:41.724 --> 51:42.634
Just like that.

51:42.850 --> 51:44.841
I'm that good.

51:45.061 --> 51:46.926
It was smart
about the C of O.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.888
And the, uh, cot in the
back room is a nice touch.

51:50.108 --> 51:51.894
Just don't shoot the next guy
in your driveway.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.191
What do you mean,
the next guy?

51:55.196 --> 51:57.312
We both know I'll be back.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.751
Oh, come on, Wait.
I just washed my car.

52:19.971 --> 52:22.883
Now you're putting your big old
greasy fingerprints all over it.

52:23.099 --> 52:26.136
Spotted this car in Sheridan
the other night.

52:26.352 --> 52:29.765
Well, is there anything illegal
about Indians being in Sheridan?

52:29.981 --> 52:31.437
Nope.No.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.356
But there's something
awfully coincidental

52:34.569 --> 52:36.560
about you being at
the same motel in Sheridan

52:36.779 --> 52:38.690
where the head of the Irish Mob
is staying.

52:38.906 --> 52:43.149
Well, uh, I was once in the same
restaurant as Susan Lucci.

52:43.369 --> 52:46.327
Does that mean I should be
nominated for a Daytime Emmy?

52:46.539 --> 52:48.279
And then there's a record

52:48.499 --> 52:52.083
of you flying out to
Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut

52:52.295 --> 52:54.126
where this mob boss is rumored
to work.

52:54.339 --> 52:57.331
That was just two days after
Nighthorse went to see him.

52:57.550 --> 53:00.007
So you want to know
what I think?

53:00.219 --> 53:01.675
No.

53:01.888 --> 53:05.301
I think Jacob told you that
he turned down the Irish Mob.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.302
You flew back to make
your own deal.

53:08.353 --> 53:11.140
That would explain
why the mob said they had a deal

53:11.356 --> 53:13.813
with the casino and why
Nighthorse said they didn't.

53:14.025 --> 53:16.357
He knew nothing about it.

53:16.569 --> 53:19.356
Boy, you're -- you're making me
sound like a movie villain.

53:19.572 --> 53:20.937
Huh?

53:21.157 --> 53:24.320
Jetting out to meet the mob,
selling out my own boss.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.071
Well, I'm not that smart.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.619
Oh, I never said
you were smart.

53:28.831 --> 53:32.073
But I do think you had your own
side deal with the mob,

53:32.293 --> 53:35.126
and you were pocketing
all the cash.

53:35.338 --> 53:39.923
But now they're pulling out, you
stand to lose a lot of money.

53:40.134 --> 53:42.841
I bet that makes you angry.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.965
You know
what makes me angry?

53:45.181 --> 53:48.139
Covering for that lying
half-breed Nighthorse.

53:48.351 --> 53:51.843
You think he doesn't know what
goes on inside his own casino?

53:52.980 --> 53:55.813
[sighs] Okay.
Here's what actually happened.

53:56.025 --> 53:58.641
He did say no
to his IRA buddies.

53:58.861 --> 54:00.772
But then he ordered me
to go back

54:00.988 --> 54:03.365
and make a deal
with those dirty lrishmen.

54:03.574 --> 54:06.281
He wanted them to deal with me
and keep him out of it.

54:06.494 --> 54:09.736
So when your car was parked
outside that hotel in Sheridan,

54:09.956 --> 54:13.244
you were negotiating with
the mob on Nighthorse's behalf.

54:13.459 --> 54:14.494
Bingo.

54:14.711 --> 54:16.372
Shane told me
they were pulling out.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.714
Said he wasn't making enough
money to justify the trouble

54:18.923 --> 54:20.424
he had with this --
this damn new Hector

54:20.633 --> 54:21.839
and, of course, you.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.760
So that's why you shot at me
outside Nighthorse's house.

54:25.972 --> 54:27.928
'Cause I cost you
a lot of money.

54:28.141 --> 54:29.927
Listen.
I could care less about that.

54:30.143 --> 54:32.134
I make good money
as the head of security.

54:32.353 --> 54:34.059
A lot more than I made
when l was a cop.

54:34.272 --> 54:35.352
[chuckles]

54:35.565 --> 54:38.352
But you know who does care?
Jacob.

54:38.568 --> 54:39.683
He went through the roof

54:39.902 --> 54:41.938
when I told him the mob
was pulling out.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.862
Sounds to me like you're
throwing him under the bus

54:46.075 --> 54:48.191
to cover for yourself,
Malachi.

54:48.411 --> 54:50.527
Let me ask you this,
bonehead.

54:50.747 --> 54:52.362
When you were being
"shot at,"

54:52.582 --> 54:55.619
did any of those bullets hit
Jacob's precious house?

54:55.835 --> 54:58.451
I'm guessing not.

54:58.671 --> 55:00.411
Come on, Walt.
When are you gonna learn?

55:00.631 --> 55:03.919
Jacob Nighthorse is the master
of the long con.

55:04.135 --> 55:06.626
He's throwing us all
under the bus.

55:08.014 --> 55:10.175
Why should I believe
any of this?

55:10.391 --> 55:13.679
You want proof that he's
a criminal and a murderer?

55:14.520 --> 55:16.260
Huh?
I can give you that proof.

55:16.481 --> 55:19.689
I know where all the bodies
are buried.

55:19.901 --> 55:22.768
You meet me tonight, and I'll
give you everything you need

55:22.987 --> 55:24.818
to bring Nighthorse
to his
knees.

55:42.590 --> 55:43.625
Hello?

55:43.841 --> 55:45.547
Henry.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.474
I heard you had a very busy day
today.

55:56.979 --> 55:58.685
Yeah.

55:59.607 --> 56:01.598
The place was flooded
with people.

56:01.818 --> 56:03.558
Um...

56:04.821 --> 56:07.187
And I've never felt
so alone.

56:08.866 --> 56:11.027
Everyone thinks
that I can help them, Henry,

56:11.244 --> 56:13.155
but I don't know
that I can.

56:13.371 --> 56:15.862
The last person
that I tried to help,

56:16.082 --> 56:18.744
I ended up --
I ended up...

56:20.461 --> 56:23.373
[voice breaking]
I ended up killing her husband.

56:28.052 --> 56:30.589
[crying]
I murdered someone, Henry.

56:32.890 --> 56:33.925
Shh.

56:38.938 --> 56:40.599
Shh.

56:52.201 --> 56:54.908
You did not take a life,
Cady.

56:55.663 --> 56:58.154
You saved one.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.380
Some in my tribe would say
it is sacrilege

57:12.597 --> 57:14.883
to give an eagle feather
to a white person.

57:17.351 --> 57:21.139
War feathers are only supposed
to be passed down in families.

57:27.361 --> 57:30.819
But you are my family, Cady.

57:33.242 --> 57:35.733
And when you defended Asha,

57:35.953 --> 57:39.662
you showed yourself to be
a true Cheyenne warrior.

57:48.049 --> 57:49.835
Thank you.

57:52.386 --> 57:53.637
Thank you, Henry.

57:53.846 --> 57:55.632
[Jacob]
Hey.

57:56.766 --> 57:58.802
Jacob.

58:05.107 --> 58:06.722
Sorry I couldn't get here
soonen

58:06.943 --> 58:11.061
Just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

58:15.326 --> 58:19.444
I'm glad my...
gift proved useful.

58:20.665 --> 58:22.656
Sorry I had to use it.

58:22.875 --> 58:24.740
Yeah.

58:24.961 --> 58:28.874
Sometimes force is the only
thing people will listen to.

58:31.092 --> 58:32.878
It can be very difficult

58:33.094 --> 58:36.803
to deal with the worst
of what happens out here.

58:38.683 --> 58:42.722
But I knew you had the strength
to handle it.

58:44.772 --> 58:48.731
Henry, may I see you outside
for a moment?

59:06.752 --> 59:09.619
I'm proud of you, Cady.

59:26.147 --> 59:27.512
So...

59:31.777 --> 59:33.358
Turns out J.P. Wright

59:33.571 --> 59:36.187
is not the only asshole
going down this week.

59:37.575 --> 59:38.940
What do you mean?

59:41.162 --> 59:44.404
You held up your end
of the bargain, Henry.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.363
It's time I held up mine.

59:47.877 --> 59:50.209
You're gonna need this.

1:00:08.522 --> 1:00:10.353
[engine shuts off]

1:00:12.443 --> 1:00:13.933
[gun clicks]

1:00:28.793 --> 1:00:32.331
You would think that a person
that was worried about a mob hit

1:00:32.546 --> 1:00:35.288
would notice
that they were being followed.

1:00:35.508 --> 1:00:37.794
Why are you following me,
Vic?

1:00:38.010 --> 1:00:39.216
A better question is,

1:00:39.428 --> 1:00:41.009
what the hell are you doing
out on the res?

1:00:42.848 --> 1:00:45.305
Meeting Malachi.

1:00:45.518 --> 1:00:47.224
Here?

1:00:47.937 --> 1:00:49.302
Why?

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:52.726
'Cause he's either gonna
give me evidence that proves

1:00:52.942 --> 1:00:55.775
Nighthorse is behind the
criminal activity at the casino

1:00:55.986 --> 1:00:58.944
or he's gonna try
and kill me.

1:00:59.156 --> 1:01:02.273
A murder attempt is all I need
to arrest him.

1:01:02.493 --> 1:01:04.358
That's great.

1:01:04.578 --> 1:01:06.785
Except you'll be dead.

1:01:22.847 --> 1:01:25.054
Kevlar?

1:01:25.850 --> 1:01:27.715
You've changed.

1:01:27.935 --> 1:01:29.721
Yep.

1:01:29.937 --> 1:01:34.727
I started to realize that doing
everything the same way

1:01:34.942 --> 1:01:37.183
hasn't been working out
too well, so...

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:41.145
You ever think about
giving it all up?

1:01:42.741 --> 1:01:46.825
Living a safe,
simple life...

1:01:48.247 --> 1:01:49.703
...where you don't need
Kevlar?

1:01:52.835 --> 1:01:55.918
Well, I certainly wouldn't blame
you if that's what you wanted.

1:01:59.842 --> 1:02:02.174
Maybe someday.

1:02:06.557 --> 1:02:08.969
All right.
I'm going.

1:02:09.185 --> 1:02:10.550
Hold on.

1:02:11.353 --> 1:02:12.388
[sighs]

1:02:12.605 --> 1:02:13.390
I'm going with you.

1:02:13.606 --> 1:02:14.516
Vic.
What?

1:02:15.399 --> 1:02:17.731
I've changed, too.

1:02:17.943 --> 1:02:20.195
I'm done letting you do
stupid shit on your own.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:22.690
Let's go.

1:02:27.578 --> 1:02:29.694
[bell chiming]

1:03:18.629 --> 1:03:20.745
Funny meeting you guys here.

1:03:20.965 --> 1:03:22.580
[Jacob]
Yeah.

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:27.339
Bet you thought we were a final
goodbye from Shane Muldoon.

1:03:27.554 --> 1:03:29.260
Well...

1:03:29.473 --> 1:03:31.509
That's what this is?
A final goodbye?

1:03:31.725 --> 1:03:33.306
It is.

1:03:33.519 --> 1:03:36.386
It was always gonna end
like this, Malachi.

1:03:36.605 --> 1:03:39.642
I knew when I opened
the casino

1:03:39.858 --> 1:03:43.021
that it was gonna attract
the criminal element.

1:03:43.237 --> 1:03:46.445
You were always just meant to be
a flu shot,

1:03:46.657 --> 1:03:52.072
that little bit of virus
that you inject into the body

1:03:52.288 --> 1:03:55.405
so the body can learn
to fight off the infection.

1:03:55.624 --> 1:03:58.286
And now the body's gotten
stronger,

1:03:58.502 --> 1:04:02.211
and it's time to get rid of
the sickness once and for all.

1:04:02.423 --> 1:04:05.665
Hank, you do know
that this is all for show,
right?

1:04:05.884 --> 1:04:07.715
It's pure theater.

1:04:07.928 --> 1:04:10.305
He's saying this stuff
just for your benefit.

1:04:10.514 --> 1:04:13.301
No.
It's all true.

1:04:14.768 --> 1:04:19.102
You ordered that hit on me
'cause you knew...

1:04:20.441 --> 1:04:22.477
...l'd figured out
your scam...

1:04:24.528 --> 1:04:27.110
and I was gonna put a stop
to all of it.

1:04:27.323 --> 1:04:32.113
The loan sharking, the muggings,
the prostitution, the heroin.

1:04:35.122 --> 1:04:40.242
You put that IRA flag in my yard
to make it look like the mob,

1:04:40.461 --> 1:04:42.622
but I know it was you.

1:04:42.838 --> 1:04:45.625
See, Hank? You're supposed to
listen to that crap

1:04:45.841 --> 1:04:49.083
and go running it over to your
friend there Walter Lawnmower.

1:04:50.179 --> 1:04:54.263
Jacob doesn't realize
that he's too late.

1:04:55.434 --> 1:04:57.140
I talked to Walter already,

1:04:57.353 --> 1:05:01.767
and he knows that Jacob
was behind this mob deal.

1:05:01.982 --> 1:05:03.358
And he knows
that you, uh,

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:08.027
faked that hit on yourself
to protect your crimes.

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:09.694
And we all know

1:05:09.907 --> 1:05:13.240
if Walter Longmire
wants something to be true,

1:05:13.452 --> 1:05:15.613
he makes it true.

1:05:15.829 --> 1:05:17.569
You're an astounding creature,
Malachi.

1:05:17.790 --> 1:05:19.826
I never met anyone
anywhere

1:05:20.042 --> 1:05:22.909
who could lie
with your shamelessness.

1:05:23.128 --> 1:05:27.497
But at the end of the day,
it's still lying.

1:05:28.342 --> 1:05:31.254
And finally I have proof.

1:05:32.137 --> 1:05:35.129
I found the second ledger
from the Red Pony.

1:05:35.349 --> 1:05:37.465
Uh, what second ledger?

1:05:41.355 --> 1:05:42.640
This one.

1:05:43.690 --> 1:05:45.396
I've never seen that
in my life.

1:05:45.609 --> 1:05:47.474
[Henry] It was in your office
at the Red Pony.

1:05:47.694 --> 1:05:52.279
Oh. If that's true,
then somebody planted it there.

1:05:52.491 --> 1:05:54.231
No, that's the pure theater.

1:05:54.451 --> 1:05:56.942
Because all three of us know
that ledger proves

1:05:57.162 --> 1:06:00.404
that you have laundered
tens of thousands of dollars

1:06:00.624 --> 1:06:02.034
through the Red Pony.

1:06:02.251 --> 1:06:05.038
So here's the situation.

1:06:05.254 --> 1:06:10.920
Malachi, you will never again
set foot on this reservation.

1:06:11.135 --> 1:06:16.004
'Cause if you do,
I'll hand that book to the feds,

1:06:16.223 --> 1:06:19.090
and you'll spend the rest
of your life in prison.

1:06:19.309 --> 1:06:22.096
If I'm going down
for this,

1:06:22.312 --> 1:06:25.054
I'm gonna take you right down
with me.

1:06:26.233 --> 1:06:28.565
Nobody's gonna believe
that all this happened

1:06:28.777 --> 1:06:29.892
without your blessing,

1:06:30.112 --> 1:06:35.357
you smug,
arrogant son of a white whore.

1:06:35.576 --> 1:06:36.941
[grunts]

1:06:42.291 --> 1:06:44.202
[grunting]

1:06:53.260 --> 1:06:56.377
Back when this was
all Cheyenne land,

1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:08.769
Now, you are the worst kind
of traitor.

1:07:09.943 --> 1:07:13.185
Stealing from
your own people.

1:07:13.405 --> 1:07:17.239
Getting your own people hooked
on heroin.

1:07:17.993 --> 1:07:21.030
You have no honor.

1:07:25.542 --> 1:07:32.254
By this mark on your face,
people will know that.

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:41.673
You can never come back
to our homeland.

1:07:42.935 --> 1:07:45.972
[chuckles]
Your homeland.

1:07:46.188 --> 1:07:49.055
That's a -- That's a real joke.
[laughs]

1:07:49.274 --> 1:07:52.482
I'm more Indian
than the two of you combined.

1:07:52.694 --> 1:07:56.778
I lived on this land
before either of you was born.

1:07:56.990 --> 1:07:59.106
Well, it is not your home
anymore.

1:08:01.411 --> 1:08:05.654
Before you go,
you need to do one more thing.

1:08:06.875 --> 1:08:09.366
This is the deed
to the Red Pony.

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:12.202
Sign your name,
and it transfers back to me.

1:08:12.422 --> 1:08:14.583
Nowl know
why you're here.

1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:17.462
[chuckles] You're just like
the rest of them.

1:08:17.678 --> 1:08:19.589
Petty and greedy.

1:08:19.805 --> 1:08:22.797
Willing to stand by
and watch him humiliate me

1:08:23.016 --> 1:08:24.722
just to get your bar back.

1:08:29.523 --> 1:08:32.356
That is not
why I am here.

1:08:32.568 --> 1:08:36.060
I am here
because of a boy named Mingan.

1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:39.772
You know nothing about him,
and I am sure you do not care.

1:08:39.992 --> 1:08:42.028
But your heroin killed
his father.

1:08:43.495 --> 1:08:46.953
And the violence
and the fear

1:08:47.165 --> 1:08:49.156
and the helplessness
you spread through the tribe

1:08:49.376 --> 1:08:50.786
killed Mingan.

1:08:51.003 --> 1:08:53.460
That is why I am here...

1:08:54.756 --> 1:08:57.213
...and why you will never
come back.

1:09:12.399 --> 1:09:14.731
[chuckles]

1:09:15.861 --> 1:09:18.978
You thought it was bad
when I owned you, Hank?

1:09:19.197 --> 1:09:20.403
But who owns you now?

1:09:21.742 --> 1:09:22.777
Huh?

1:09:22.993 --> 1:09:25.075
Who owns you now, Hank?!

1:09:26.038 --> 1:09:27.744
Who owns you now, Hank?!

1:09:27.956 --> 1:09:29.457
Who owns you now?!
