00:05.140 --> 00:07.810
There's been
an attack on the police.

00:07.860 --> 00:11.100
Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.210
The vehicles travelled along
Crown Avenue and then turned left

00:16.260 --> 00:19.820
into Long Lane, almost immediately
after which the ambush took place.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.050
Akers chose the route? Yeah.

00:27.100 --> 00:30.050
The third victim's name is being
withheld from the public

00:30.100 --> 00:33.380
because she was from Witness
Protection - DS Jayne Akers.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.660
Do you think she ever knew?

00:40.180 --> 00:41.690
CRASH!

00:41.740 --> 00:43.970
Your vehicle was the only one
that wasn't shot at.

That's my new DC, Kate Foster.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.100
Hi.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.210
Denton just made a call
to the hospital from a payphone.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.540
Get over there, Steve.
Check on the witness.

I'm very sorry about DC Trotman.
Thank you.

We're interested in what you were
up to at the hospital.

02:48.620 --> 02:50.740
There on a tip-off, weren't you?

02:52.020 --> 02:54.330
If you speak
to Superintendent Hastings...

02:54.380 --> 02:56.810
Where did that tip-off come from,
eh?

02:56.860 --> 02:59.330
Who's got that
kind of inside information?

02:59.380 --> 03:00.770
I do honestly want to help, sir,

03:00.820 --> 03:03.540
but I'm really not at liberty
to answer that question.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.090
Your partner fell five floors.

03:08.140 --> 03:13.330
The pathologist had to spoon half
her brain back inside her skull.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.620
Do you not want to help us
get the bastard that did it?

03:17.700 --> 03:20.970
There were two of you, weren't there,
eh?

03:21.020 --> 03:22.300
Two of you. One of him.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.090
Sit down.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.570
You're going nowhere till I've got
corroboration you were

03:28.620 --> 03:30.100
there on lawful business.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.820
You know a Lorna Barrett?

04:00.100 --> 04:02.650
Of her.
She's my next-door neighbour, sir.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.490
Professional Standards are serving
you a Reg 15.

04:05.540 --> 04:08.090
Ms Barrett's c/o'd assault
occasioning ABH.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.330
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

04:09.380 --> 04:12.900
You struck her with a bottle,
beat her head against the floor.

04:13.900 --> 04:14.940
May I, sir?

04:16.420 --> 04:17.459
DC Foster.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.090
What are you playing at?

04:23.140 --> 04:25.340
I'd just feel more comfortable
with a witness, sir.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.620
Sir. Ma'am.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.100
Would you mind repeating
what you just said, sir?

04:37.460 --> 04:41.210
Lorna Barrett alleges you
struck her with a bottle

04:41.260 --> 04:43.970
and alleges you beat
her head against the floor.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.930
Ms Barrett is an alcoholic with
a long history of mental illness.

04:48.980 --> 04:50.020
It's very sad.

04:51.340 --> 04:52.490
You deny the charges?

04:52.540 --> 04:57.610
An officer gets accused, falsely,
and the vultures start circling.

04:57.660 --> 05:00.450
I'm just not going to take it, sir.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.530
I'm going to clear my name, even if

05:02.580 --> 05:05.020
it means dragging the lot of you
through the courts.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.340
You're already under
investigation by AC-12.

05:10.820 --> 05:13.940
If Standards have got any sense,
they'll make it their problem.

05:26.140 --> 05:29.020
Steve, you're fine. Come on.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.530
Could I have a word with you,
please?

05:36.580 --> 05:39.100
Here...if you want to go
down that road.

05:42.180 --> 05:45.850
Your treatment of my officer was
unsympathetic and provocative.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.250
As a matter of policy,
Anti-Corruption cannot discuss

05:48.300 --> 05:51.050
the details of any ongoing
investigation, as you well know.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.930
Yeah, well, you have it your way,
eh?

05:53.980 --> 05:56.010
Leave real policing to the experts.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.100
Experts?

05:58.860 --> 06:01.820
Would that be your guard
unit you're referring to, sir?

06:05.140 --> 06:08.050
Are you all right? How's your head?
Do you need to see the doctor?

06:08.100 --> 06:10.580
I'm fine.
What happened to the guards?

06:11.820 --> 06:16.530
They got locked out on a disused
fire escape chasing an intruder -

06:16.580 --> 06:18.890
thought they could make their way
back to their posts

06:18.940 --> 06:20.050
before anybody noticed.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.450
Pair of bloody idiots
got Georgia killed.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.140
HE SIGHS

06:30.340 --> 06:32.180
You can be very proud
of your daughter.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.890
She was a dedicated young officer
who gave her life

06:36.940 --> 06:38.660
trying to protect the public.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.860
If there's anything I can do,
just call on me at any time.

06:45.940 --> 06:46.980
Let me, let me.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.460
I promise you,
we'll find the people who did it.

07:17.660 --> 07:18.860
So...I'm here.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.540
Thank you.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.500
Well, why the mystery?

07:27.740 --> 07:28.780
We lost Georgia.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.090
The girl we had dinner with?

07:33.140 --> 07:35.180
Oh, my God, Ted, I'm so sorry.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.020
Is there anything I can do?

07:52.180 --> 07:53.610
Don't.

07:53.660 --> 07:56.900
Don't use the poor girl's
death to diminish what you did.

07:59.820 --> 08:03.380
If you're sending flowers,
make them from me too.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.980
CLOCK TICKS

08:14.740 --> 08:17.700
POUNDING MUSIC NEXT DOOR

08:21.140 --> 08:24.180
LOUD POUNDING MUSIC

08:29.860 --> 08:31.890
You. I could sue your arse.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.890
If we could try to get along like
grown-ups, maybe you could understand

08:35.940 --> 08:39.059
that it would help if you didn't play
your music so loudly at night.

08:40.580 --> 08:43.580
Well, if it helps you,
how about you help me?

08:45.180 --> 08:46.930
Hundred.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.090
I'm not giving you money.

08:49.140 --> 08:51.220
A hundred and I keep it down.

08:59.820 --> 09:00.860
Ten.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.500
Fine.

09:10.940 --> 09:11.980
MUSIC STOPS

09:21.340 --> 09:25.690
Michelle? I'm DI Denton. Is there
somewhere quiet we can talk?

09:25.740 --> 09:28.210
Carly's foster parents thought
she might've been with you

09:28.260 --> 09:29.450
the night she disappeared.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.890
In your original statement,
you referred to a boyfriend?

09:31.940 --> 09:33.250
I don't know if he was.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.650
She started hanging out less and
it was like maybe he was the reason.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.490
In your statement, you said you
didn't remember his name.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.170
I think it was Matt or something.

09:41.220 --> 09:43.170
But the policewoman said
if I couldn't be sure,

09:43.220 --> 09:44.570
not to put it in the statement.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.690
And what else do you
remember about him?

09:46.740 --> 09:48.170
Asian...

09:48.220 --> 09:49.450
fit...

09:49.500 --> 09:50.530
older.

09:50.580 --> 09:51.570
How old?

09:51.620 --> 09:53.490
Dunno, 30?

09:53.540 --> 09:56.690
After Carly disappeared, did her
boyfriend ever come looking for her?

09:56.740 --> 09:58.140
No.

10:00.420 --> 10:02.010
Maybe he didn't come looking for her

10:02.060 --> 10:03.850
because he was in on her
disappearance?

10:03.900 --> 10:07.340
I want to go and see Carly's
foster parents again. OK.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.330
What's the address again?

10:11.380 --> 10:13.420
Erm, Queen Street.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.380
FC1 4RC.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.410
I've been trying to find
the right time,

10:26.460 --> 10:27.930
but there never seems to be one.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.500
I'd rather not talk about that.

10:30.740 --> 10:33.210
People talk, that's all.
Round the station.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.770
Well, they shouldn't.

10:34.820 --> 10:35.940
Yes, ma'am.

10:42.700 --> 10:45.690
Sorry, ma'am, I don't mean to
badger you, it's just...

10:45.740 --> 10:48.370
well, you were the one who made
the point of calling me in

10:48.420 --> 10:51.370
to witness the meeting
with Mallick. True.

10:51.420 --> 10:56.090
In which case, it might help if you
gave me the gen on your neighbour.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.180
She's lying.

10:58.820 --> 11:02.210
If you're worried about a charge,
though, I could say I was there,

11:02.260 --> 11:05.290
just to back up
your version of events.

11:05.340 --> 11:07.260
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE

11:23.820 --> 11:25.140
Hi.

11:37.020 --> 11:41.140
Hi, I'm Detective Sergeant Steve
Arnott. We spoke at the hospital.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.580
Can I come in?

11:46.820 --> 11:49.410
I know you had a very long
interview with my colleagues

11:49.460 --> 11:52.970
on the Major Violent Crime Unit, so
I'll keep this as brief as possible.

11:53.020 --> 11:56.010
I want to start with the two
firearms officers who were

11:56.060 --> 11:58.450
assigned to protect the witness.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.970
Why weren't they at their post?

12:00.020 --> 12:03.370
Because of Joe - sorry,
that's the only name I've got.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.610
How?

12:04.660 --> 12:07.290
He was dressed in scrubs
and he told them

12:07.340 --> 12:09.890
he thought he'd seen someone
out on the fire escape with a gun.

12:09.940 --> 12:12.290
As soon as they stepped out to
check, he locked the door.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.370
How'd he got onto
the intensive care unit

12:14.420 --> 12:16.220
and passed himself off as a nurse?

12:17.740 --> 12:19.580
I... I gave him access.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.410
How do you know Joe?

12:23.460 --> 12:25.570
Um, a couple of days earlier,

12:25.620 --> 12:28.050
he bumped into my car
in the hospital car park.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.850
He was very apologetic.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.490
He offered to pay for the repairs
at his mate's garage,

12:32.540 --> 12:35.730
so I wouldn't have to
wait for the insurance.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.580
So, tell me how Joe involved you.

12:38.700 --> 12:42.570
We took my car at his mate's garage,
and then he gave me a lift home.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.730
Then the next morning,
he called round

12:44.780 --> 12:46.610
so we could drop Nathan at nursery.

12:46.660 --> 12:49.370
But instead of going to
collect my car,

12:49.420 --> 12:51.660
Joe said we were going
to the hospital.

12:53.220 --> 12:54.210
He said...

12:54.260 --> 12:55.980
BOY SINGS TO HIMSELF

12:58.580 --> 13:01.010
He said he knew people
who would kill Nathan

13:01.060 --> 13:03.170
unless I did what
they needed me to do.

13:03.220 --> 13:06.530
I know I should've told someone
so they could stop him,

13:06.580 --> 13:08.290
but I was too scared.

13:08.340 --> 13:10.450
Joe said they'd already
killed police,

13:10.500 --> 13:12.420
so not even they could protect me.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.940
It's all right.

13:19.460 --> 13:22.370
Around the time of the killing,
there was a call to the hospital.

13:22.420 --> 13:26.250
Do you know or have you ever had
any contact with a police officer

13:26.300 --> 13:28.340
named Detective Inspector
Lindsay Denton?

13:29.860 --> 13:31.050
No.

13:31.100 --> 13:35.050
You're sure?
Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.140
Definite.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.090
Was she the one?

13:42.140 --> 13:43.570
The one?

13:43.620 --> 13:45.140
Who got killed?

13:47.780 --> 13:48.860
No.

13:51.660 --> 13:53.060
ENGINE REVS

14:00.300 --> 14:01.970
You OK? Fine.

14:02.020 --> 14:04.610
What were Denton's movements
while we were at the hospital?

14:04.660 --> 14:07.050
She made the call,
then visited her mum's nursing home.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.930
I checked it out and she stayed with
her mum for exactly half an hour.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.610
The exact time of the killing.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.570
Perfect alibi -
plus using the phone box.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.490
Yeah, well, I checked out the trace.
Now, the timing matches exactly

14:16.540 --> 14:19.370
with an outside call that was
connected to the reception desk

14:19.420 --> 14:21.970
on the intensive care unit -
a female voice, same time.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.010
Had to be Denton.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.730
The caller insisted they page
the nurse, but they wouldn't

14:25.780 --> 14:27.420
because she wouldn't give a name.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.770
I didn't know Georgia.
She seemed nice.

14:32.820 --> 14:34.060
Yeah.

14:36.620 --> 14:39.660
Mate, if you ever need to talk...
Cheers.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.460
Same.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.210
Right. 'Night.

14:49.260 --> 14:50.300
'Night.

14:59.220 --> 15:02.050
This is an e-fit of the suspect.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.170
We put that together with
the nurse there.

15:04.220 --> 15:06.410
Be great
if we could circulate to the press.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.650
Absolutely.
I want those guards disciplined.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.740
Sir.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.850
This can't bloody get out.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.260
The witness was close to
regaining consciousness!

15:16.700 --> 15:18.660
It's very disappointing, sir.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.330
Our best lead.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.700
Sir.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.970
So where are you with the vehicle?

15:28.020 --> 15:29.170
The ambush vehicle?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.530
Yes, the ambush vehicle.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.770
There's no forensics to connect
it to the gunmen.

15:33.820 --> 15:35.970
Since we can't trace them
via the vehicle,

15:36.020 --> 15:37.970
we've been concentrating
on traffic cams,

15:38.020 --> 15:41.090
trying to plot the route that it took
that night, but so far we've...

15:41.140 --> 15:42.180
Nothing.

15:47.740 --> 15:48.780
Right.

15:51.860 --> 15:54.930
You all right to hang
around for a couple of secs, Les?

15:54.980 --> 15:57.820
Jo's got an idea
she wants to go over with you.

15:58.900 --> 15:59.940
All right, sir.

16:01.940 --> 16:02.980
What idea?

16:04.020 --> 16:06.490
From now on,
Les does the press conferences.

16:06.540 --> 16:07.890
And this is my idea?

16:07.940 --> 16:10.570
Obviously, if there are any
major breakthroughs,

16:10.620 --> 16:12.340
I'll step back up to the plate.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.530

to schedule a meeting with

16:18.580 --> 16:21.290
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden?
'His diary's full for the week.'

16:21.340 --> 16:25.210
Yeah... I appreciate he's got
a hectic round of media appoint...

16:25.260 --> 16:26.450
'I can go back to him.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.130
'Did you say you were
Superintendent Hayman?'

16:29.180 --> 16:31.450
No, no, Hastings, like the battle.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.010
'Leave it with me, sir.'

16:33.060 --> 16:35.020

Hi, Jo. Pleased to meet you.
I'm Lindsay Denton.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.170
I know who you are
and I'm already late for a meeting.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.770
I'm so sorry, I know you must be
rushed off your feet, but this,

16:58.820 --> 17:00.370
it won't take a minute of your time.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.570
You must get so many calls and
e-mails... I'm sorry.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.490
I should've replied.
It's been a busy time.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.450
It's about publicising
the disappearance

17:06.500 --> 17:07.890
of a teenage girl, Carly Kirk.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.490
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.730
You're avoiding me. No.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.690
I'm a serving Missing Persons

17:13.740 --> 17:17.050

until someone tells me otherwise.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.089
Of course.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.810
Well, then help me find this girl.

17:19.859 --> 17:21.540
OK.

Sorry about my boss's questioning.
He's under a lot of pressure.

18:05.140 --> 18:08.210
A&B Carriage Repairs was a legit

Unit's been vacant ever since.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.570
What became of the nurse's car?

18:11.620 --> 18:14.410
Found dumped. It's being checked
over for forensics.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.610
Found any? Nothing.
Nothing here either.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.340
We're locking it down and
moving out.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.100
He's a laugh a minute.

18:36.860 --> 18:40.010
By the looks, it's not been touched
since they moved out.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.210
Apparently.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.660
You checked CCTV
from the hospital car park?

18:44.860 --> 18:45.900
Maybe.

Joe's car.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.380
No accident. Mm.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.050
He never once turns round
so the camera can see him.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.490
That's cos he knows it's there.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.290
You get a trace on that car?

19:12.340 --> 19:15.980
Same story as the ambush -
stolen vehicle, cloned plates.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.570
He's the go-between - you get him,
you get the killers,

19:20.620 --> 19:23.420
you get the police officer
they're working with.

19:26.980 --> 19:30.330
You never saw
a face in the hospital?

19:30.380 --> 19:31.540
No.

19:32.460 --> 19:33.980
Only Georgia did.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.930
Boss, we've had a call off Carly's
mate, Michelle.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.250
She remembered
something about the boyfriend.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.130
Said he was into cars,
might've been a mechanic. OK.

20:36.180 --> 20:38.100
Er, just give me a minute.

20:40.780 --> 20:42.580
We're all set to meet the press.

20:44.420 --> 20:45.780
Come with me a minute.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.940
Take a seat.

Er...

21:03.820 --> 21:05.060

21:06.260 --> 21:09.410
Have they found a body? No. No.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.170
But unfortunately there isn't going
to be a press conference.

21:12.220 --> 21:13.260
Why not?

21:14.260 --> 21:18.020
There's...insufficient
interest in the story.

21:19.420 --> 21:21.530
I get it.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.690
Carly's just some
nothing from a broken home.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.220
I'm so sorry.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.650
But no-one's giving up on Carly.
This is your job!

21:30.700 --> 21:33.650

21:33.700 --> 21:38.490

them to ask people to find Carly.

21:38.540 --> 21:39.610
Tess.

21:39.660 --> 21:43.490
She's upset, DI Denton.
We know it's not your fault. No?

21:43.540 --> 21:44.980
Whose is it, then?

22:18.020 --> 22:20.620
What did you tell him? Working late?

22:21.620 --> 22:23.170
Yeah, something like that.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.260
He believes you?

22:27.540 --> 22:28.620
Kate...?

22:34.660 --> 22:38.570
Are they any nearer to finding out
what happened to Jayne?

22:38.620 --> 22:39.770
I think so.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.060
And?

22:43.580 --> 22:45.610
There's a prime suspect.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.490
Sounds like there's a doubt.

They've got a source claiming

by a safety camera

"Rather not"? With respect, sir,
that's what no reciprocity means.

31:16.140 --> 31:19.810
It's the appropriate way of
investigating blue-on-blue crime.

31:19.860 --> 31:23.220
A way of keeping
the lid on internal leaks, sir.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.700
Of course.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.130
We're the best in the business, sir.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.300
I think we can sort
this thing out pretty quickly.

31:37.740 --> 31:41.050
I'll open up Witness Protection
to your team. Thank you, sir.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.490
There's a DI in AC-9.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.490
He's your man. You'll second him.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.610
As you wish, sir.

31:47.660 --> 31:51.210
Whatever it takes to nail
those bastards, right, Ted?

31:51.260 --> 31:53.220
Absolutely. Thank you, sir.

32:12.020 --> 32:14.740
Thought you could do with a lift.
Thanks.

32:17.420 --> 32:19.610
Er, don't go.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.410
Is there something I can do?

32:21.460 --> 32:23.210
It's me, actually.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.050
So far, I haven't done anything

32:25.100 --> 32:26.890
towards your
professional development.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.660
Well, you've had a lot
on your plate.

32:33.300 --> 32:36.540
So...why Missing Persons?

32:38.380 --> 32:41.730
Um... Well, it's challenging
detective work, plus,

32:41.780 --> 32:44.970
when you do find them, it's
massively rewarding emotionally. Mm.

32:45.020 --> 32:46.730
When you find them.

32:46.780 --> 32:50.330
Yeah. It's not so
brilliant when you don't.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.650
So, have you done
much of this before?

32:52.700 --> 32:54.890
A year on a Misper Squad
at East Mids.

32:54.940 --> 32:58.010
No! No, then you must
know Sally Fordham?

32:58.060 --> 33:00.290
Um...

33:00.340 --> 33:03.730
What? There isn't anybody
by that name on the squad.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.380
Oh.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.170
Sorry, I'm getting mixed up.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.810
It's been a bit of a rough day.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.690
Do you mind if we pick
this up another time?

33:14.740 --> 33:16.540
Yeah. No worries. Great.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.850
Kate.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.780
Thanks for the tea.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.570
My name is
Detective Inspector Denton,

33:59.620 --> 34:00.930
from 4th Street Station.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.850
I need to talk to
somebody who can give me

34:02.900 --> 34:05.180
a list of all your
employees over the last year.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.300
Seen DI Denton? No, sorry.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.060
PHONE BLEEPS

34:55.020 --> 34:58.290
PHONE RINGS

34:58.340 --> 34:59.530
DS Arnott.

34:59.580 --> 35:02.250
Denton's disappeared,
now she's asking me to meet her.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.530
You suspicious?

35:03.580 --> 35:05.770
I'm not sure.
It's an industrial unit.

35:05.820 --> 35:07.090
A&B Carriage Repairs?

35:07.140 --> 35:09.690
That's the empty repair garage
they used as a front.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.970
Now I'm suspicious.

35:12.020 --> 35:14.130
I'll call in back-up.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.570
I know the location -
I can be there in ten minutes.

35:16.620 --> 35:17.770
If she sees you, then...

35:17.820 --> 35:20.530
We'll hold back till you
pocket-dial. Don't blow my cover.

35:20.580 --> 35:24.370
I won't. But if anything
doesn't feel right, you call.

35:24.420 --> 35:25.820
Received.

35:27.020 --> 35:28.420
SHE EXHALES

36:23.060 --> 36:25.370
Boss.
You took your time, didn't you?

36:25.420 --> 36:28.450
Sorry, I...
Christ's sake. It's round the back.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.330
Isn't this place part of the
Major Violent Crime investigation?

36:31.380 --> 36:33.850
I started ringing garages to see
if any of their employees

36:33.900 --> 36:35.850
fitted the description
of Carly's boyfriend

36:35.900 --> 36:37.410
and started acting suspiciously

36:37.460 --> 36:39.530
around about the time
of the disappearance.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.490
This place came up as disused

36:41.540 --> 36:43.850
but crosschecked
with the MVC investigation.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.690
Aren't they protecting the scene?

36:45.740 --> 36:48.740
Forensics have finished.
They've released it.

36:51.100 --> 36:52.410
Ma'am, is this a good idea,

36:52.460 --> 36:54.610
what with AC-12's
investigation into the ambush?

36:54.660 --> 36:55.850
Ugh!

36:55.900 --> 36:57.370
Ugh...

36:57.420 --> 36:59.530
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

36:59.580 --> 37:01.330
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:01.380 --> 37:04.010
No? Brand-new DC, doesn't care
that I'm under investigation.

37:04.060 --> 37:07.290
Wants to be my new best friend?
I'm just trying to get along. Yeah?

37:07.340 --> 37:10.130
What have I told you
about being honest with me?

37:10.180 --> 37:12.010
I hate liars.

37:12.060 --> 37:14.210
DS Arnott, AC-12?

37:14.260 --> 37:15.700
Boss...

37:17.180 --> 37:19.970
People have underestimated me
my whole life.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.060
TRAIN HOOTS

37:30.180 --> 37:32.460
Absolutely, It's fine. Nearly done.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.700
I'll be there in ten. Promise.

37:39.860 --> 37:43.260
Hi. 8:30 OK for
tomorrow's briefing?

37:44.580 --> 37:48.820
Look, Jo, the Hargreaves interview,
the whole thing, this isn't working.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.810
You're firing me? No.

37:52.860 --> 37:55.700
You know that's more
hassle than it's worth.

37:57.340 --> 38:00.690
You're bringing someone else in.
Why?

38:00.740 --> 38:03.940
You have to ask? Seriously?

38:25.780 --> 38:27.180
Can you talk?

38:29.860 --> 38:32.250
What's there to say?

38:32.300 --> 38:34.210
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

38:34.260 --> 38:36.530
No way did Kate mess up.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.060
We underestimated her.

38:39.340 --> 38:40.890
I've let you down, sir.

38:40.940 --> 38:42.380
Don't talk rubbish.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.260
DI Denton doesn't know
the half we've got on her.

38:47.780 --> 38:50.330
That call to the hospital,
now the stuff with the garage.

38:50.380 --> 38:53.050
Steve, I want you to contact
Denton and her rep.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.570
Tell her I want
her in here on a Reg 15.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.700
Any prevarication, you arrest her.

38:58.940 --> 39:00.770
I'm telling you.

39:00.820 --> 39:02.610
She'll be wishing she never
messed with you

39:02.660 --> 39:04.490
by the time we're through with her.

39:04.540 --> 39:05.940
Sir.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.810
Sure you're OK?

39:15.860 --> 39:17.730
Wounded pride, that's all.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.170
I'll give you a lift home.

39:19.220 --> 39:21.340
Thanks, but it's best you don't.

39:24.380 --> 39:26.460
How'd it go with Georgia's parents?

39:27.900 --> 39:29.140
It went.

39:32.460 --> 39:34.580
DOORBELL RINGS

39:44.020 --> 39:45.460
Hey.

39:52.660 --> 39:55.140
Why didn't you tell me
she was your partner?

39:56.900 --> 39:59.020
You were feeling bad enough already.

40:03.580 --> 40:07.170
One thing the other
police officer said...

40:07.220 --> 40:11.170
They said, me being the only witness,

40:11.220 --> 40:15.330
chances were, Joe planned
to kill me afterwards.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.780
You and your partner saved my life.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.540
Suppose.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.980
Had you been together long,
you and her?

40:34.100 --> 40:37.410
SHE PLAYS SOFT, MELODIC PIANO

40:37.460 --> 40:41.330
POUNDING MUSIC NEXT DOOR

40:41.380 --> 40:45.020
SHE PLAYS LOUDER OVER POUNDING MUSIC

40:58.140 --> 41:01.340
SHE PLAYS LOUDER

41:03.140 --> 41:05.180
DISCORDANT NOTES

41:09.660 --> 41:11.740
HARSH, BUZZING DRONE

41:17.060 --> 41:18.050
DRONING STOPS

41:18.100 --> 41:22.970
AC-12 interview with DI Denton,
in the presence of DI Royal,

41:23.020 --> 41:25.850
by Superintendent Hastings,
DS Arnott and DC Fleming.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.500
DI Denton,
did you assault DC Fleming?

41:30.660 --> 41:33.700
Sorry, sir, you'll have to help me.
Who's DC Fleming?

41:36.420 --> 41:40.610
For the purposes of the tape,
I'm indicating DC Fleming.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.900
I'm confused, sir. That's DC Foster.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.330
The officer known to
you know as Foster -

41:47.380 --> 41:49.050
did you assault her, yes or no?

41:49.100 --> 41:51.810
No. You didn't strike her?

41:51.860 --> 41:54.890
There was an altercation
that got a little bit physical.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.690
For the tape, I note that DC Foster -
sorry, Fleming -

41:57.740 --> 41:59.890
shows no significant injuries.

41:59.940 --> 42:02.770
You're in the habit of
assaulting people, DI Denton? No.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.850
Have you ever assaulted anyone? No.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.730
Did you assault Lorna Barrett,
your next door neighbour? No.

42:07.780 --> 42:10.340
She gave a statement alleging
you did. I'll read from it.

42:12.380 --> 42:15.130
"Lindsay Denton struck me across
the side of the head with a bottle

42:15.180 --> 42:17.610
"and then she beat my head
against the floor repeatedly."

42:17.660 --> 42:19.570
Lorna Barrett's
an unreliable witness.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.290
She's making a vexatious complaint.

42:21.340 --> 42:23.090
I interviewed Lorna Barrett.

42:23.140 --> 42:25.210
She provided a coherent
account of the assault,

42:25.260 --> 42:27.450
had injuries consistent
with her version of events,

42:27.500 --> 42:30.810
and accurately described
you as the assailant.

42:30.860 --> 42:33.810
There's a witness
to my relationship with Ms Barrett.

42:33.860 --> 42:36.090
She's in this room right now.

42:36.140 --> 42:38.220
Shall I call you Foster or Fleming?

42:39.500 --> 42:40.890
Fleming.

42:40.940 --> 42:43.730
Ms Barrett played loud music
late at night. Can you confirm that?

42:43.780 --> 42:44.930
Yes.

42:44.980 --> 42:47.250
And did I respond in
a potentially aggressive fashion

42:47.300 --> 42:49.170
to Ms Barrett's anti-social
behaviour?

42:49.220 --> 42:50.450
No.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.970
Ms Barrett's allegations represent
a history of anti-social conduct,

42:54.020 --> 42:55.970
who you might have been
taken in by, DS Arnott,

42:56.020 --> 42:58.420
though she doesn't appear
to be your type.

43:04.700 --> 43:08.170
I think we should revisit
the events of 5th September.

43:08.220 --> 43:11.970
DI Denton has already provided
a comprehensive statement

43:12.020 --> 43:13.770
and interview in this regard.

43:13.820 --> 43:15.090
Yes, as a witness.

43:15.140 --> 43:17.290
These matters will
now be addressed under the terms

43:17.340 --> 43:20.010
of the Regulation 15 notice
you've just been served, DS Arnott.

43:20.060 --> 43:22.010
You've seen
this illustration before -

43:22.060 --> 43:23.650
document five in your folders.

43:23.700 --> 43:27.570
It shows the location of the
safe house, 12 St James' Close,

43:27.620 --> 43:30.890
the route taken by the convoy,
the location of the ambush which

43:30.940 --> 43:34.250
led to the deaths of DS Akers,
Sergeant Wallis and PC Butler.

43:34.300 --> 43:36.570
It also shows the location
of 4th Street Station,

43:36.620 --> 43:40.170
which DI Denton has claimed was
the intended destination that night.

43:40.220 --> 43:44.250
DI Denton, this is now your
opportunity to amend

43:44.300 --> 43:46.580
or clarify your previous statement.

43:50.660 --> 43:52.330
SHE WHISPERS: I've got nothing
to add.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.210
DI Denton has nothing to add.

43:55.260 --> 43:57.970
There is one specific point
we'd like to explore in more depth

43:58.020 --> 43:59.820
with you, and that is the route.

44:01.260 --> 44:03.850
This is an excerpt from the
first interview with DI Denton.

44:03.900 --> 44:06.660
For the tape, a transcript
will appear on screen.

44:10.340 --> 44:13.050
ARNOTT: This back route, it would
lead to 4th Street Station,

44:13.100 --> 44:15.250
but only if you'd continued
along Crown Avenue.

44:15.300 --> 44:17.810
The vehicles turned
left into Long Lane...

44:17.860 --> 44:22.850
DENTON: The, um... The decision
appeared to make sense at the time.

44:22.900 --> 44:27.450
There were roadworks
on Crown Avenue,

44:27.500 --> 44:31.290
with temporary traffic signals
controlling a single lane.

44:31.340 --> 44:34.090
It was a potential hold-up
that would've left us vulnerable.

44:34.140 --> 44:37.170
There were no roadworks
on Crown Avenue that night.

44:37.220 --> 44:39.540
Works had been completed
the day before.

44:41.060 --> 44:42.530
I wasn't aware.

44:42.580 --> 44:46.810
HASTINGS: You didn't make a point
of getting up-to-date travel
information?

44:46.860 --> 44:48.170
No.

44:48.220 --> 44:49.260
BLEEP

44:50.180 --> 44:52.130
DI Denton's service
vehicle is fitted with

44:52.180 --> 44:54.370
a Type-60 Travel System.

44:54.420 --> 44:58.050
I'm familiar with this system
and so is DI Denton.

44:58.100 --> 45:00.050
I've been a passenger
in said vehicle

45:00.100 --> 45:03.330
and observed DI Denton operate
this system faultlessly.

45:03.380 --> 45:06.810
The TS-60 provides
instantaneous traffic

45:06.860 --> 45:10.140
and roadworks information
relating to the chosen route.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.890
The service vehicle driven
by DI Denton on the night

45:13.940 --> 45:16.500
of the ambush was
also fitted with the TS-60.

45:18.340 --> 45:21.850
This system was in operation on
the night of September 5th and would

45:21.900 --> 45:24.900
have advised DI Denton there were
no longer roadworks on Crown Avenue.

45:31.140 --> 45:32.690
You drove them straight into

45:32.740 --> 45:34.180
that ambush, didn't you?

45:36.700 --> 45:38.300
It was no accident, was it?

45:40.060 --> 45:43.210
I genuinely believed
that there were roadworks.

45:43.260 --> 45:44.970
In the stress of the situation,

45:45.020 --> 45:47.170
I didn't even look
at the information on the sat nav.

45:47.220 --> 45:50.700
I strenuously deny any involvement
in setting up the ambush.

45:52.740 --> 45:55.210
Three of our own -
three of YOUR own -

45:55.260 --> 45:57.810
in the morgue because of you,
DI Denton.

45:57.860 --> 46:00.370
Make that four. Yes.

46:00.420 --> 46:03.250
DC Georgia Trotman,
killed attempting to protect

46:03.300 --> 46:06.250
the life of the witness
who was the target of that ambush.

46:06.300 --> 46:09.290
DI Denton has absolutely
no connection

46:09.340 --> 46:12.210
to the tragic death of DC Trotman.

46:12.260 --> 46:15.250
You'll kindly keep your counsel
till we're said and done.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.050
The witness survived the ambush
and was receiving treatment

46:18.100 --> 46:21.250
when there was a second, successful,
attempt on his life.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.170
DI Denton was observed
making a phone call

46:23.220 --> 46:24.730
from a public telephone box

46:24.780 --> 46:27.570
approximately 15 minutes
prior to the witness's death.

46:27.620 --> 46:29.500
Why did you use a phone box?

46:30.620 --> 46:32.890
I didn't want the call
appearing in my phone history.

46:32.940 --> 46:35.420
Yeah we get that, DI Denton.
Why didn't you?

46:36.460 --> 46:39.010
It was an impulse,
I knew it was inadvisable.

46:39.060 --> 46:42.090
Said call was identified with the
number of the hospital switchboard -

46:42.140 --> 46:44.330
it was put through to
the intensive care unit

46:44.380 --> 46:45.970
where the witness was being treated.

46:46.020 --> 46:48.130
The member of staff
who took the call has provided

46:48.180 --> 46:50.970
a statement that the female caller
asked for Staff Nurse Tindall

46:51.020 --> 46:53.570
by name, Staff Nurse Tindall
being the intensive care nurse

46:53.620 --> 46:55.850
blackmailed into furnishing
access to the witness.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.170
Who made that call, DI Denton?

46:57.220 --> 46:59.090
Not me. I saw you make that call.

46:59.140 --> 47:01.570
I'm not denying making A call.

47:01.620 --> 47:04.530
The witness was the only person
who could verify that

47:04.580 --> 47:07.490
I had nothing to do
with setting up the ambush.

47:07.540 --> 47:10.050
I'd heard rumours that he
was about to regain consciousness

47:10.100 --> 47:11.850
and I wanted to find out
if they were true.

47:11.900 --> 47:13.770
How come you knew
the name of the nurse,

47:13.820 --> 47:16.370
the very same nurse who was
involved in killing him? I didn't.

47:16.420 --> 47:18.490
I hung up when they put me through.
I...

47:18.540 --> 47:22.010
I realised it was a stupid
thing to do. I wasn't thinking.

47:22.060 --> 47:24.890
You expect us to believe that?

47:24.940 --> 47:27.090
If I had conspired in the murder...

47:27.140 --> 47:28.450
Which you didn't.

47:28.500 --> 47:30.930
..why on earth would I have made
a call at that exact time?

47:30.980 --> 47:32.450
It would only incriminate me.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.850
It does.

47:33.900 --> 47:35.380
Funny that.

47:37.660 --> 47:41.770
I'm sure you've seen this
e-fit before. Who is that man?

47:41.820 --> 47:43.650
I've never seen him
before in my life.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.890
He was at the hospital,
about to kill the witness

47:45.940 --> 47:48.940
and DC Trotman, at exactly the
same time you made your phone call.

47:53.100 --> 47:56.260
DS Arnott, what's your theory
on why I'd make that call?

47:57.380 --> 47:58.890
It was a signal.

47:58.940 --> 48:01.610
Or you got cold feet,
tried to call off the murder.

48:01.660 --> 48:04.210
I'm as aware as you all are
that it isn't possible to trace

48:04.260 --> 48:06.850
a call within
an internal telephone network.

48:06.900 --> 48:09.490
All you can do is identify
the number dialled from the call box

48:09.540 --> 48:11.650
as being that of the
hospital switchboard -

48:11.700 --> 48:13.650
and I admit to that part.

48:13.700 --> 48:16.210
After that, all you have
is the vague evidence from somebody

48:16.260 --> 48:18.530
who can't be sure who called,
what they said, or why.

48:18.580 --> 48:21.460
I deny that it was me
who asked to speak to the nurse.

48:23.300 --> 48:25.020
That your final answer?

48:31.900 --> 48:33.100
DC Fleming?

48:36.100 --> 48:38.850
DI Denton text-messaged me
to attend a meeting

48:38.900 --> 48:41.290
at the Canalside Industrial Estate,

48:41.340 --> 48:43.930
purporting to be in connection
with a breakthrough

48:43.980 --> 48:45.490
in a missing persons enquiry.

48:45.540 --> 48:48.970
The specific location given
by DI Denton was a unit formerly

48:49.020 --> 48:51.370
belonging to A&B Carriage Repairs.

48:51.420 --> 48:54.090
This disused unit was a front
for individuals connected

48:54.140 --> 48:56.730
with the 5th of September ambush.

48:56.780 --> 48:59.890
What was your connection, DI Denton?

48:59.940 --> 49:02.410
There's no connection to me.

49:02.460 --> 49:05.010
I went there following
a lead on my investigation

49:05.060 --> 49:07.930
into the disappearance
of a 15-year-old girl.

49:07.980 --> 49:10.930
The fact that it'd gone out of
business and was already connected

49:10.980 --> 49:14.530
to an ongoing investigation - these
facts only added to my suspicions.

49:14.580 --> 49:16.650
Yes, but instead of
following your suspicions,

49:16.700 --> 49:20.570
you assault DC Fleming.
I was emotional, sir. Why?

49:20.620 --> 49:23.250
I imagined what it
must've been like for that girl

49:23.300 --> 49:25.010
if she'd been abducted
to that place.

49:25.060 --> 49:29.330
I was frustrated with the case, and
I was angry with DC Fleming's lies.

49:29.380 --> 49:32.970
Lies, yes, you don't like
being lied to, do you, DI Denton?

49:33.020 --> 49:35.730
The fact of the matter is,
neither do we.

49:35.780 --> 49:37.250
DI Denton, I'm arresting you

49:37.300 --> 49:39.330
for conspiracy to murder
a protected witness.

49:39.380 --> 49:41.530
State the grounds.
You do not have to say anything.

49:41.580 --> 49:44.210
Under Code G of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act,

49:44.260 --> 49:46.450
state the grounds.
Why are you arresting me?

49:46.500 --> 49:48.810
As the arresting officer,
I submit...

49:48.860 --> 49:51.810
One - you're the sole survivor
of an ambush

49:51.860 --> 49:53.730
you had the means of setting up.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.330
Two - you made a phone call,

49:55.380 --> 49:58.330
and freely admit that
you made a phone call,

49:58.380 --> 50:01.370
to the hospital, after which
two people were murdered.

50:01.420 --> 50:03.730
Regarding the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act,

50:03.780 --> 50:07.930
I note subsection
5C(1), C(2), E and F,

50:07.980 --> 50:11.650
and I'm sure you're very
familiar with those terms.

50:11.700 --> 50:16.570
Lindsay Denton, you do not have
to say anything, however,

50:16.620 --> 50:19.650
you may harm your defence
if you fail to mention

50:19.700 --> 50:23.450
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

50:23.500 --> 50:26.140
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.450
I would like to say something.

50:31.500 --> 50:33.060
Keep the tape running.

50:36.060 --> 50:38.410
Superintendent Hastings,

50:38.460 --> 50:42.940
I have in my possession certain
financial records pertaining to you.

50:47.100 --> 50:48.730
How the hell did you get these?

50:48.780 --> 50:51.130
The document requests
were signed off by an officer

50:51.180 --> 50:53.010
of Chief Superintendent rank.

50:53.060 --> 50:55.290
Anything I say may be
used in evidence -

50:55.340 --> 50:56.850
that works both ways, sir.

50:56.900 --> 51:00.650
Sir, DI Denton has asked that
the tape be left running.

51:00.700 --> 51:02.490
She's got a right to be heard.

51:02.540 --> 51:05.210
Without going into details,
the records show that

51:05.260 --> 51:09.380
Superintendent Hastings is in
considerable financial difficulties.

51:10.860 --> 51:16.770
These have absolutely no relevance
to the case against you, DI Denton.

51:16.820 --> 51:20.610
I'm reading from a transcript
of our first interview.

51:20.660 --> 51:25.370
Superintendent Hastings -
"Our strongest supposition is that

51:25.420 --> 51:27.530
"criminal interests
attempted to assassinate

51:27.580 --> 51:29.810
"the witness
to prevent him testifying.

51:29.860 --> 51:34.010
"Those interests would pay a pretty
penny for an inside man, or woman.

51:34.060 --> 51:37.730
"Any officer in the kind of
financial mess you're in, DI Denton,

51:37.780 --> 51:39.570
"is honour-bound to declare it,

51:39.620 --> 51:42.100
"on account of vulnerability
to bribery."

51:43.900 --> 51:46.180
Have you declared
your situation, sir?

51:48.740 --> 51:50.170
Sir?

51:50.220 --> 51:51.490
No.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.180
"No."

51:57.740 --> 52:01.580
DS Arnott, I'd like you
to view these photographs.

52:09.540 --> 52:12.130
Do you recognise the location?

52:12.180 --> 52:15.290
Yeah. This is the home,
under protective custody,

52:15.340 --> 52:17.450
of Staff Nurse Claire Tindall.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.690
You interviewed her in connection
with events at the hospital.

52:20.740 --> 52:23.250
There are more photos.
How did you get these?

52:23.300 --> 52:25.370
For the tape, the images
show DS Arnott returning

52:25.420 --> 52:26.770
to Staff Nurse Tindall's home.

52:26.820 --> 52:30.250
And he's later photographed
in an upstairs bedroom with her.

52:30.300 --> 52:32.980
What was the purpose
of your return visit?

52:35.620 --> 52:36.610
(Um...)

52:36.660 --> 52:40.260
I'm sure you took notes of the
conversation. May we hear them?

52:44.340 --> 52:45.740
No notes, then?

52:47.180 --> 52:48.490
I'm sure you're aware -

52:48.540 --> 52:51.370
or perhaps you're not, but I hope
that Superintendent Hastings is -

52:51.420 --> 52:53.810
that inappropriate
relations with a witness

52:53.860 --> 52:57.090
is a breach of the England & Wales
Police Conduct Regulations 2008.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.130
I know the Regs.

52:58.180 --> 53:00.450
Were you coaching
Staff Nurse Tindall to corroborate

53:00.500 --> 53:03.170
the allegations against me
regarding the call to the hospital?

53:03.220 --> 53:04.730
I don't have to. No?

53:04.780 --> 53:07.050
I'd say you're in desperate
need of someone being able

53:07.100 --> 53:08.450
to identify me as the caller.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.180
Was Staff Nurse Tindall
able to do that for you?

53:15.020 --> 53:17.500
For the tape,
DS Arnott's not forthcoming.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.140
No. No, she wasn't able?

53:22.620 --> 53:23.890
She wasn't able.

53:23.940 --> 53:27.010
Was she able to state
any relationship with me?

53:27.060 --> 53:28.300
No.

53:30.140 --> 53:33.090
We've established that you know
the witness better than most.

53:33.140 --> 53:34.660
Is she likely to lie?

53:36.340 --> 53:39.980
No. If I was connected,
she'd say, wouldn't she?

53:42.260 --> 53:44.090
Yes.

53:44.140 --> 53:48.060
DS Arnott, you know a suspect's
three incriminating criteria.

53:50.940 --> 53:52.970
Motive, opportunity, means.

53:53.020 --> 53:55.410
Motive - I had none.

53:55.460 --> 53:58.890
Why on earth would
I want to kill fellow officers?

53:58.940 --> 54:02.130
Opportunity - I had none.

54:02.180 --> 54:04.530
I only found out about
the witness in a phone call

54:04.580 --> 54:07.290
one hour before the ambush.

54:07.340 --> 54:10.210
Means - I had none.

54:10.260 --> 54:12.130
I've never worked Serious Crime.

54:12.180 --> 54:15.900
I don't have the criminal connections
to be able to conspire in an ambush.

54:17.620 --> 54:19.570
DC Fleming.

54:19.620 --> 54:21.460
Is this your mobile phone?

54:23.540 --> 54:26.140
QUIETLY: Yes.
Please speak up for the tape.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.250
Yes.

54:28.300 --> 54:30.090
I came into possession
of this mobile phone

54:30.140 --> 54:32.730
during our altercation
at the Canalside Industrial Estate,

54:32.780 --> 54:33.820
is that correct?

54:35.460 --> 54:38.290
Yeah. You stole it from me.

54:38.340 --> 54:41.490
Your call history makes
for very interesting reading.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.300
Significant people
at significant times.

54:46.140 --> 54:48.930
Stealing is against the law.

54:48.980 --> 54:50.740
My bad.

54:51.980 --> 54:54.450
Let's save the rest of this
conversation for another time.

54:54.500 --> 54:57.770
Does that suit you, Kate?
Interview terminated.

54:57.820 --> 54:59.450
Show's over.

54:59.500 --> 55:02.020
Steve, you hold her here.

55:03.220 --> 55:05.500
Kate, you organise the custody.

55:07.300 --> 55:09.610
The best I can do for
you now, Lindsay,

55:09.660 --> 55:11.580
is find you a good solicitor.

55:19.740 --> 55:21.490
AC-12 are bringing in an officer.

55:21.540 --> 55:24.770
She works at 4th Street Station, so
ideally somewhere she's not known.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.780
ELEVATOR PINGS

55:29.980 --> 55:32.330
We'll fax over the paperwork
for charging. Thanks.

55:32.380 --> 55:34.650
They've handed over
the Witness Protection files.

55:34.700 --> 55:37.010
Let's get cracking.
I want this place locked down.

55:37.060 --> 55:40.570
Access by named personnel only.
Keep an eye on her. Shut the door.

55:40.620 --> 55:42.730
Not one piece of paper shall leave
this building

55:42.780 --> 55:45.180
without my approval in triplicate.
Thank you.

55:48.900 --> 55:50.220
Good man.

55:53.340 --> 55:54.820
Mother of God.

55:56.420 --> 55:59.930
The protected witness.
The wee gobshite this was all about.

55:59.980 --> 56:01.580
Christ.

56:10.300 --> 56:12.290
We need to start over.

56:12.340 --> 56:15.850
Call your wives, your husbands,
your boyfriends, your girlfriends.

56:15.900 --> 56:19.250
No-one is leaving the premises
till we have sifted through

56:19.300 --> 56:21.340
every single piece of information.

56:46.020 --> 56:48.420
What was in
the Witness Protection files?

56:52.380 --> 56:54.780
I saw the reaction.
Was it the witness?

56:58.260 --> 57:00.010
Oh, my God. Was it someone you knew?

57:00.060 --> 57:01.740
I can't discuss this.

57:03.100 --> 57:04.490
How can you let this happen to me,

57:04.540 --> 57:07.100
when you know that there's
so much more to it?

57:12.860 --> 57:13.980
ELEVATOR PINGS
Let's go.

57:29.180 --> 57:31.650
DS Arnott, DI Denton.

57:31.700 --> 57:33.810
You OK to book her in for me?

57:33.860 --> 57:36.930
Lindsay Denton,
I'm satisfied your arrest is lawful.

57:36.980 --> 57:39.770
I'm authorising your detention
at this police station

57:39.820 --> 57:43.690
so that we can secure and preserve
evidence of the investigation,

57:43.740 --> 57:45.730
and to obtain evidence from you...

57:45.780 --> 57:47.660
AUDIO FADES

58:01.620 --> 58:04.220
I'm innocent. You know I am.
