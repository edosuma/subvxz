Less than 24 hours ago,
Emma told me

00:05.092 --> 00:07.224
that she thought Phillip Stroh

00:07.268 --> 00:10.010
was back in Los Angeles,
and now she's dead.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.750
As the police
were checking out the gate

00:11.794 --> 00:14.188
to Emma's backyard,
I had a Sniffy in my pocket,

00:14.231 --> 00:16.494
giving me their contacts
and the picture

00:16.538 --> 00:18.018

for me to text them

00:18.061 --> 00:20.063
infected all their devices
with malware,

00:20.107 --> 00:23.023

control of their cells.

staring at us. Look.

I hope so.

If we do that, though,
it raises a big red flag.

but the ones outside the towers
have to be reassigned.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.959
Oh, come on.
That's complete bullshit, Fritz.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.439
You're turning my stepson
and his friend into live bait!

08:47.483 --> 08:49.833
Andy, they're perfectly safe.
I promise you.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.879
Tao: We can release
Stroh's picture.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.968
Finally.
A relevant idea. If I release his picture

08:54.011 --> 08:55.535
and someone recognizes him
when we're not there,

08:55.578 --> 08:56.753
Stroh might attack.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.276
He is quick on his feet,

08:58.320 --> 08:59.713
and he always seems to have
a backup scheme.

08:59.756 --> 09:01.018
Sounds like
you impressed them.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.585
Yeah,
I'm not sure about that,

09:02.629 --> 09:05.719
but things are definitely
not going to plan.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.765

and now they're regrouping.

Fritz: ...shouldn't be just
protecting people...

Like what?

09:13.291 --> 09:14.554
...better suited
to SOB resources.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.772
They're not just detectives,
you know.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.208
They're a bunch
of bureaucrats.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.949
Budgets are more important
to them than outcomes.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.255
They're idiots.

...that Stroh
ends up killing.

09:21.952 --> 09:22.953
I know you disagree with this.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.433
I'm sorry, guys.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.782
Yeah.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.959
Well, save your apologies
for the dead.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.571
If anybody calls,
I'll be in the office.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.007
Flynn: You notice

09:33.050 --> 09:34.530
about pulling protection
from his wife.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.358

happening.

Great handicap, not getting
into that office with Provenza.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.971
Who cares?
He's alone.

Stroh's past associates,

giving him a hand.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.934

his phone at his desk?

Sanchez: Okay,
so here's where we are.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.461
I've gone on Zillow.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.897
Zillow?
What's Zillow?

09:53.941 --> 09:56.030
Uh, it's a real-estate
website.

09:56.073 --> 10:01.122
And it shows
that the house behind Emma's

10:01.165 --> 10:02.558
on the other side
of that gate

10:02.602 --> 10:04.168
is a rental.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.606
So how come you know
about this Zillow?

10:06.649 --> 10:09.217
Uh, nearly everyone knows
about Zillow, sir.

this property behind Emma's

10:19.967 --> 10:21.577
hasn't been home
since the murder.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.188
He just said that the rental
agreement was managed online

10:24.232 --> 10:25.537
and he never met
the tenant.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.061
Obviously Carl.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.584
I've sent patrol to search

10:28.628 --> 10:30.499
and asked ID to print
and collect DNA, sir.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.370
DNA takes time.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.634
Damn this boy.

10:34.677 --> 10:39.247
Well, the, um, vase that he left
at Stroh's mother's house,

10:39.290 --> 10:41.728
we don't have his prints,
and neither does the FBI.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.251
But we do have

10:43.294 --> 10:45.122
lots of good stuff

facial recognition programs,

from some foreign governments.

Oh, great.

with lung cancer

10:57.613 --> 10:59.702

Stroh's DNA, sir.

Yes, but he eventually closed
all of Gwen's joint accounts,

in Cyprus disappeared.
