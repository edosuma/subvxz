I've always wanted to get as

00:30.731 --> 00:38.538
far away as possible from
the place that I was born.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.242
Far both geographically
and spiritually.

00:42.243 --> 00:50.243
To leave it behind.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.834
Tangier, it's Morocco.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.936
But from 1923 through 1956, it

01:43.937 --> 01:44.971
was loosely governed by the

01:44.972 --> 01:48.475
major powers, an
international zone.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.378
For years it seemed
everything was permitted.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.914
Nothing was forbidden.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.551
At the northern tip of Africa, a

01:58.552 --> 02:06.552
short ferry hop from Spain,
Tangier was a magnet for

02:07.928 --> 02:09.596
writers, remittance men,
spies, and artists.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.564
If you were a bad boy of your

02:10.565 --> 02:11.565
time, you liked drugs, the kind

02:11.566 --> 02:12.699
of sex that was frowned upon at

02:12.700 --> 02:15.235
home and an affordable lifestyle
set against an exotic

02:15.236 --> 02:23.236
background, Tangier was for you.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.849
Matisse, Genest,
William Burroughs.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.883
Many have come this way, staying

02:30.884 --> 02:34.020
a while or hanging around.

02:34.021 --> 02:37.190
But no one stayed longer or

02:37.191 --> 02:38.658
became more associated with

02:38.659 --> 02:42.929
Tangier than the novelist
and composer Paul Bowles.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.031
In works like "the sheltering

02:45.032 --> 02:46.499
sky" he created a romantic

02:46.500 --> 02:50.337
vision of Tangier that persists

02:50.338 --> 02:51.671
even today, a dream that's

02:51.672 --> 02:56.376
become almost inseparable in the

02:56.377 --> 02:58.945
minds of many from reality.

02:58.946 --> 03:03.616
I'm here to find
that dream city.

03:03.617 --> 03:09.423
The place Burroughs
referred to as "Interzone."

03:10.658 --> 03:18.658
♪

03:27.808 --> 03:29.909
Tangier, like I said, was a city

03:29.910 --> 03:32.011
of ex-pats... people with pasts,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.012
people who simply didn't like

03:33.013 --> 03:35.114
where they were and craved

03:35.115 --> 03:38.751
somewhere and something else.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.387
The grand socco is the gateway

03:40.388 --> 03:42.522
to the Medina where you could

03:42.523 --> 03:49.662
find the Casbah, which
means fortress by the way.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.731
The port is to the east, and

03:51.732 --> 03:52.765
right in the middle of it all,

03:52.766 --> 03:55.302
the petit socco, called the last

03:55.303 --> 04:01.774
stop, the meeting place, the
switchboard of Tangier.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.810
Reasons for settling in Tangier

04:03.811 --> 04:08.481
diverge, but everyone sooner or

04:08.482 --> 04:09.582
later since the beginning of

04:09.583 --> 04:11.684
memory comes to cafe Tingis.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.685
Jonathan Dawson came to this

04:12.686 --> 04:16.789
city over 20 years ago as a

04:16.790 --> 04:18.425
journalist, and he never left.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.427
He lives a life not too distant

04:20.428 --> 04:23.563
from Burroughs' fantasy.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.097
Cake and tea at 4:00 every day

04:25.098 --> 04:27.734
served by his man servant.

04:27.735 --> 04:33.440
He may not have a gazelle,
but a pet rooster will do.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.142
And every day he makes the

04:36.143 --> 04:37.677
rounds of the cafes, seeing all

04:37.678 --> 04:44.016
the old faces, ending up
sooner or later here.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.017
This is the petit socco?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.619
This is the petit socco.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.755
Yes.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.257
It existed in venetian times,

04:51.258 --> 04:53.426
existed in Roman times, in the

04:53.427 --> 04:55.895
Portuguese times and the English

04:55.896 --> 04:56.963
were here for 22 years and then

04:56.964 --> 05:00.099
the international city
until 1956, now here.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.270
This is a very historic
scare, very historic.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.872
As a writer, I've noticed

05:05.873 --> 05:07.840
everybody who comes here to do

05:07.841 --> 05:09.976
an article does
the same article.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.011
It is so damn boring.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.580
They're all the beat generation

05:13.581 --> 05:14.647
and there are lots of other

05:14.648 --> 05:15.682
stories in Morocco apart from

05:15.683 --> 05:18.785
that, but everyone
likes the beats.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.388
Bill Burroughs, Tennessee

05:21.389 --> 05:23.490
Williams, they were all here,

05:23.491 --> 05:26.158
but that's a small part
of the Moroccan history.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.193
That's a 15-year page.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.295
There was a life before
that and a life after that.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.329
You're here.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.864
Yeah.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.900
It was inevitable.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.035
Let's pretend those
guys never came.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.606
What is this place?

05:39.607 --> 05:42.274
The reality is, you can
read the story and live it.

05:42.275 --> 05:42.910
People do come here and try to

05:42.911 --> 05:45.878
live it, but they
don't stay very long.

05:45.879 --> 05:46.946
They smoke a little dope, go to

05:46.947 --> 05:49.015
a cheap hotel and go
home with bedbugs.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.049
And a great story.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.083
And a great story.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.219
The attitude here is different
than other parts of

05:53.220 --> 05:54.754
Morocco.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.457
I think they have a higher

05:57.458 --> 06:00.560
tolerance of tradition of
bad or outrageous behavior.

06:00.561 --> 06:05.231
They have a high tolerance
of mad people, you know?

06:05.232 --> 06:11.971
But Moroccans essentially
are very tolerant people.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.039
They quite like madness as well.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.074
They kind of celebrate
that a bit.

06:15.075 --> 06:15.609
You know?

06:15.609 --> 06:16.577
How Moroccan is Tangier?

06:16.578 --> 06:18.745
It's a Moroccan city
with a European outlook.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.747
You can stand up on the
boulevard and see Spain and

06:20.748 --> 06:22.281
Gibraltar and see all sorts of

06:22.282 --> 06:25.418
people passing through, but
it is a Moroccan city.

06:25.419 --> 06:29.088
I'm 62 years old.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.623
I didn't know international days

06:30.624 --> 06:32.692
which finished in 1956, but at

06:32.693 --> 06:33.760
that time, I think Europeans may

06:33.761 --> 06:35.828
have outnumbered Moroccans
in the center of this city.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.430
It's not the case now.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.431
There's very few Europeans

06:38.432 --> 06:41.734
actually living here full time.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.270
The notion of living a life

06:44.271 --> 06:46.906
apart, of being somewhere else,

06:46.907 --> 06:49.509
there are those who
like that feeling.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.612
I like that feeling.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.646
Then there are those who may

06:53.647 --> 06:54.647
live apart, may live somewhere

06:54.648 --> 06:59.819
else, but they're not
entirely comfortable.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.387
It's the difference annoys
them or is a burden.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.990
It did, and it frustrates them.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.594
Some people have to leave
home to find their home.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.161
I'm one of those people.

07:09.162 --> 07:15.401
Whereas I didn't feel at home in

07:15.402 --> 07:16.435
the country I was born in at

07:16.436 --> 07:17.470
all, but here I feel okay.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.071
I feel very, very happy here.

07:19.072 --> 07:24.243
There is indeed something
special about this place.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.345
Burroughs described the native

07:26.346 --> 07:28.981
quarter of Tangier as a maze of

07:28.982 --> 07:34.821
sunless twisting streets
filled with blind alleys.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.288
Its smell was particularly

07:36.289 --> 07:39.926
notable to him, including a mix

07:39.927 --> 07:44.163
of hashish, seared
meat, and sewage.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.766
Tangier, before anything else,

07:46.767 --> 07:49.368
is essentially a port city,
with all the things that

07:49.369 --> 07:54.507
traditionally come
with port cities.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.542
It's situated at the choke point

07:55.543 --> 08:00.212
between the Atlantic ocean
and the Mediterranean sea.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.315
The Moroccan coast is a rich

08:03.316 --> 08:04.350
fishing ground, and a lot of

08:04.351 --> 08:07.486
people make their
living from the sea.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.089
Onshore they use a method called

08:10.090 --> 08:11.123
sentul fishing, where weighted

08:11.124 --> 08:15.294
nets basically drag fish
across the bottom of the sea.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.630
Some of that fish, the good

08:17.631 --> 08:21.934
stuff anyway, ends up here.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.936
The saveur de Poisson, or

08:23.937 --> 08:26.138
restaurant populare or Popeye's.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.174
The place has a lot of names,

08:28.175 --> 08:29.776
but locals and ex-pats alike who

08:29.777 --> 08:30.843
have been coming here for years

08:30.844 --> 08:35.914
say it has some of the
best tagine in town.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.249
Mohammed, the owner and head

08:37.250 --> 08:39.919
chef, is from the nearby rif

08:39.919 --> 08:41.020
mountains, and he sources a lot

08:41.020 --> 08:42.488
of his stuff, his produce and

08:42.489 --> 08:46.793
his Greens, from there, and
he's real proud of them.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.327
The back room is dedicated to

08:48.328 --> 08:50.396
sorting and drying various herbs

08:50.397 --> 08:51.397
which he blends into a secret

08:51.398 --> 08:56.135
mix that he claims has all
sorts of healthful and

08:56.136 --> 08:58.304
boner-inspiring benefits.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.405
If every dish I have been told

08:59.406 --> 09:02.441
over the years would make me

09:02.442 --> 09:03.475
strong worked, I would have a

09:03.476 --> 09:05.177
permanent pup tent going on

09:05.178 --> 09:07.513
down there, so I take all
that with a grain of salt.

09:07.514 --> 09:11.283
Hi.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.586
Hello.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.688
His son Hassan
delivers the food.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.558
It all starts with fresh olives,

09:19.559 --> 09:20.559
they're in season now.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.729
And roasted wall nuts.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.263
Some warm, very good bread.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.398
Squishy.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.900
And you get this stuff.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.603
Everybody gets it.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.105
A pulpy puree of figs, raisins,

09:33.106 --> 09:36.575
strawberries and full of
Mohammed's potent herbs and

09:36.576 --> 09:39.746
spices, of course.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.314
All night, 24 clock.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.449
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.917
It's supposed to
make me more manly.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.985
You know what?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.720
I'm eating.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.657
Let's not talk about
that, okay, sunshine?

09:50.658 --> 09:53.826
What is a tagine, anyway?

09:53.827 --> 09:57.229
It's a traditional Moroccan stew

09:57.230 --> 10:00.833
that can include
vegetables, meat, or ship.

10:00.834 --> 10:05.938
Tonight, baby shark, calamari
and monk fish with fresh

10:05.939 --> 10:10.943
mountain shin spinach cooked in

10:10.944 --> 10:15.414
a classic Clay pot that
gives it its name.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.016
The domed top is supposed to

10:16.016 --> 10:16.884
force the condensation back in

10:16.885 --> 10:18.450
to the dish and keep
it moist and tender.

10:18.451 --> 10:18.986
That's delicious.

10:18.987 --> 10:20.019
I think it's the Greens and the

10:20.020 --> 10:22.054
aromatics and the herbs, I
have no idea what they are.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.055
Never had anything like it.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.692
Tangier version
of farm to table.

10:25.693 --> 10:26.193
Hi.

10:26.194 --> 10:28.795
Wow.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.829
When's that?

10:29.830 --> 10:35.301
Thank you.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.971
And a whole turbot, brushed with

10:38.972 --> 10:41.573
olive oil, salt, and pepper and

10:41.574 --> 10:47.279
some coriander, then grilled
perfectly over the coals.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.348
Cuddled up next to the
fish, tiny shark kabobs.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.416
Cute.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.450
Wow, spectacular.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.119
Good value.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.921
All of this for 20 bucks?

10:54.922 --> 10:56.155
Pretty good job on Mr. Fish.

10:56.156 --> 11:00.793
That will teach you.

11:00.794 --> 11:08.794
[ Speaking foreign language ]

11:12.773 --> 11:13.806
He's freaking me out.

11:13.807 --> 11:14.841
It's like that guy with, you

11:14.842 --> 11:19.511
know, you're tripping
and does this to you?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.148
For dessert, strawberries,
pine nuts and honey.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.150
Like the whole meal, it's
eccentric and delicious.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.184
Thank you.

11:25.185 --> 11:31.958
You're welcome.

11:31.959 --> 11:38.330
I haven't had so much fruits
and nuts since Altaban.

11:38.331 --> 11:43.736
I told Mick, I said, Mick,
this is a bad crowd.

11:43.737 --> 11:49.041
But he's like, man, we
can't disappoint the fans.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.611
Ah, memories.

12:03.623 --> 12:09.962
In Tangier, I lived in one
room in the native quarter.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.064
I have not taken a bath in a

12:12.065 --> 12:16.735
year nor changed my clothes or

12:16.736 --> 12:17.770
removed them except to stick a

12:17.771 --> 12:20.940
needle every hour in the fibrous

12:20.941 --> 12:23.675
gray wooden flesh of
termal addiction.

12:23.676 --> 12:28.614
I never cleaned or
dusted the room.

12:28.615 --> 12:34.586
Amputee everyone pul boampule

12:34.587 --> 12:37.857
objections and garbage
piled up to the ceiling.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.458
Light and water long since
turned off for nonpayment.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.427
I did absolutely nothing.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.494
I could look at the end of
my shoe for eight hours.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.562
I was only roused to action when

12:43.563 --> 12:51.103
the hourglass of junk ran out."

12:51.104 --> 12:53.672
The words of William Seward

12:53.673 --> 12:56.308
Burroughs, one of my heroes.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.911
He came to Tangier in 1953,

12:58.912 --> 12:59.946
shortly after shooting his wife

12:59.947 --> 13:03.082
to death in a drunken
accident in Mexico City.

13:03.083 --> 13:08.320
He was a heroin addict, a

13:08.321 --> 13:09.355
homosexual, and an inspiration

13:09.356 --> 13:17.356
to those protohipsters who
became known as the beats.

13:19.732 --> 13:25.404
Burroughs, however,
was not a beat Nick.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.438
He was a somewhat stuffy,

13:26.439 --> 13:27.074
well-dressed St. Louis son of a

13:27.074 --> 13:28.041
good family gone wrong.

13:28.042 --> 13:29.108
He was also to my mind the

13:29.109 --> 13:30.576
greatest writer of the
whole damn bunch.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.544
On the road, you can have it.

13:31.545 --> 13:36.448
His classic "naked
lunch" was written here.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.551
A nonlinear, dark, dry humored

13:39.552 --> 13:40.619
searingly critical and satirical

13:40.620 --> 13:44.256
and profane masterpiece.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.894
Burroughs was apparently high

13:47.895 --> 13:49.761
for much of the process on

13:49.762 --> 13:57.762
heroin or locally available
prescription opiate.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.606
And the daily staple in
many of these parts.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.740
Hashish, keef and maldune.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.775
Hashish is the concentrated THC

14:03.776 --> 14:05.211
resin of the cannabis plant as

14:05.212 --> 14:07.046
well as varying amounts of its

14:07.047 --> 14:07.847
flowers and leaves that have

14:07.848 --> 14:09.381
been separated from the buds and

14:09.382 --> 14:14.320
compressed into sheet
or brick-like form.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.821
Keif is the part of the plant

14:15.822 --> 14:17.389
containing only the strongest

14:17.390 --> 14:21.027
concentration of
psychoactive ingredients.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.094
Majune is a confection made from

14:22.095 --> 14:28.267
keef, fruits, nuts,
chocolate and honey.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.369
I was, of course, fascinated by

14:30.370 --> 14:33.472
this product since reading about

14:33.473 --> 14:34.506
it and inquired of some local

14:34.507 --> 14:37.743
contacts who shall
necessarily go unnamed.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.745
How was it made?

14:39.746 --> 14:43.415
This is what I wanted to know.

14:43.416 --> 14:49.621
They were kind enough
to demonstrate.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.690
Keef is first chopped into fine

14:51.691 --> 14:53.292
granules and slowly added to

14:53.293 --> 14:55.962
melted butter and chocolate
over a low heat.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.296
You toast it and release the

14:57.297 --> 15:01.600
psychotropic goodies within.

15:01.601 --> 15:05.471
While the binder element is slow

15:05.472 --> 15:08.174
cooking in the pan, a
combination of spices are

15:08.175 --> 15:10.042
blended with ka shoes, almonds,

15:10.043 --> 15:12.744
walnuts, and dried fruit.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.812
This will be the framework to

15:13.813 --> 15:17.950
suspend the THC-laden
goodness in the next step.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.086
The cannabis-laced butter

15:20.087 --> 15:21.087
chocolate is added along with

15:21.088 --> 15:25.924
plenty of honey to bind
together all the ingredients.

15:25.925 --> 15:33.925
Then mix.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.271
Last, you roll the entirety of

15:39.272 --> 15:41.407
the mixture into a ball and

15:41.408 --> 15:48.147
either refrigerate
or dig right in.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.216
Of course, network standards and

15:50.217 --> 15:51.817
practices prohibit me from even

15:51.818 --> 15:53.385
tasting this delicious and

15:53.386 --> 15:54.920
reportedly mind-altering treat.

15:54.921 --> 15:58.024
I'm guessing, anyway.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.126
So until I see Chris, John and

16:00.127 --> 16:01.227
wolf doing bong riffs in "the

16:01.228 --> 16:02.761
situation room," I will, of

16:02.762 --> 16:04.330
course, abide by these rules

16:04.331 --> 16:09.001
because that's the
kind of guy I am.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.037
There's one particular cafe in

16:11.038 --> 16:12.104

16:12.105 --> 16:13.639
drawn in foreign dignitaries,

16:13.640 --> 16:16.242
rock stars, aristocrats and

16:16.243 --> 16:20.846
artists since it opened
its doors in 1943.

16:20.847 --> 16:26.052
Cafe Baba.

16:26.053 --> 16:31.257
Sweet mint tea in a thick
slow-moving haze of smoke.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.859

dorm room 1972.

16:36.463 --> 16:41.667

16:50.877 --> 16:54.413

16:54.414 --> 16:56.282
recollection of me doing
anything untoward in their

16:56.283 --> 16:59.051
presence because that would
be, like, wrong, dude.

16:59.052 --> 17:03.422
George is here on a Fulbright

17:03.423 --> 17:05.857

Zaneb is an artist.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.726

well, don't give me that

Tangier a whole lot.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.602
seasoned beef baked until golden

23:23.603 --> 23:26.672
and then crisped in oil.

23:26.673 --> 23:30.341
I'm good for now well, one more.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.311
Uh-oh, here we go.

23:33.312 --> 23:37.683
The main event,
tajine of chicken.

23:37.684 --> 23:38.717
Welcome, Tony.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.320
Thank you.

23:42.321 --> 23:49.127
Just gorgeous.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.229
First, chopped onions, garlic,

23:51.230 --> 23:59.230
parsley and turmeric are
blended with olive oil.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.541
The bird is generously
coated and stuffed.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.575
Then after simmering in a touch

24:03.576 --> 24:05.110
of olive oil and water, it is

24:05.111 --> 24:06.945
fried until crispy, served with

24:06.946 --> 24:11.382
roasted almonds and olives,
paprika, and ginger.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.417
Nice.

24:12.418 --> 24:13.451
He smells the food.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.087
Like anywhere else in the
Arab world, eating with your

24:16.088 --> 24:18.156
hands, always the right one, is

24:18.157 --> 24:21.793
proper dining etiquette.

24:21.794 --> 24:28.033
This is spinach.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.067
It's wild spinach.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.169
It grows in the mountains?

24:31.170 --> 24:34.139
Yeah.

24:34.140 --> 24:39.545
Chopped mountain spinach

24:39.546 --> 24:41.112
garlic, cilantro, hot and black

24:41.113 --> 24:43.715
peppers finished with
lemon and olive oil.

24:43.716 --> 24:48.453
That's delicious.

24:48.454 --> 24:49.988
I heard you are the greatest

24:49.989 --> 24:51.557
taste for food in
the world, man.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.591
I love good food.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.592
This is good.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.695
Yeah.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.764
After dinner some fruit, some

24:58.765 --> 25:05.003
mint tea, and let
the music begin.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.037
For centuries, the master

25:06.038 --> 25:08.674
musicians of Jajouka have been

25:08.675 --> 25:11.242
the musical choice of the royal

25:11.243 --> 25:13.344
families of Morocco, excused by

25:13.345 --> 25:14.379
the country's rulers from manual

25:14.380 --> 25:20.553
labor to devote themselves
to musical training.

25:22.354 --> 25:30.354
♪

25:43.442 --> 25:48.747
♪

25:48.748 --> 25:53.151
Their powerful style of Sufi

25:53.152 --> 25:55.687
transmusic has inspired many

25:55.688 --> 25:56.722
music seekers, including most

25:56.723 --> 25:57.756
notably perhaps Paul Bowles, who

25:57.757 --> 25:59.357
wrote about them and recorded

25:59.358 --> 26:02.460
them, and spread the word.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.530
Brian Jones was here and
recorded "the pipes of pan at

26:05.531 --> 26:12.370
Jajouka" with these musicians.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.005
The word spread and the master

26:14.006 --> 26:15.907
musicians have ended up being

26:15.908 --> 26:19.878
featured on albums by Annette

26:19.879 --> 26:27.753
Coleman and the rolling stones.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.321
For years, if you were a rock

26:30.322 --> 26:34.459
god, you had to come here, dig

26:34.460 --> 26:36.027
the crazy percussion, strings,

26:36.028 --> 26:38.129
and pipes that took
you to another place.

26:38.130 --> 26:43.835
It's intricate,
hypnotic, beautiful.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.939
If you're in the right frame
of mind, mesmerizing.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.484
Anyone who comes to Tangier

26:59.485 --> 27:03.689
inevitably ends up lost in
the old part of the city.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.257
The Medina is just what
you want it to be.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.359
The ancient world residing just

27:08.360 --> 27:14.666
next to and around the new one.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.735
You can walk around inside the

27:16.736 --> 27:21.807
movie in your head, play the

27:21.808 --> 27:24.710
bogey character you never were,

27:24.711 --> 27:25.744
all against an all too willing,

27:25.745 --> 27:26.778
all too genuine backdrop.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.246
Ordinarily just about the last

27:28.247 --> 27:31.382
thing in the world I would
be interested in doing is

27:31.383 --> 27:32.918
antiquing, but buried in the

27:32.919 --> 27:40.919
network of twisting narrow
streets of the old city is

27:46.532 --> 27:49.434
boutique Majid
owned by this man.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.970
And he's one interesting guy.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.004
Thank you.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.039
Come in.

27:54.040 --> 27:54.673
When he was a little kid back

27:54.673 --> 27:55.607
in the '60s, Majid left his

27:55.608 --> 27:57.175
hometown of fez and came here

27:57.176 --> 27:59.244
where he would earn money
emptying ashtrays at wild

27:59.245 --> 28:03.715
parties being thrown
here by wealthy ex-pats.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.483
He saw what these people would

28:05.484 --> 28:06.617
buy for themselves and how they

28:06.618 --> 28:07.719
would decorate their homes, and

28:07.720 --> 28:10.588
he started to look around for

28:10.589 --> 28:15.293
himself, scoring, then
reselling art and antiques.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.294
Wow.

28:16.295 --> 28:22.968
It became something
of an obsession.

28:22.969 --> 28:26.604
Now his artifacts from Morocco

28:26.605 --> 28:27.239
and north Africa are bought by

28:27.239 --> 28:28.174
collectors all over the world.

28:28.175 --> 28:29.207
Jewelry and old doors.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.309
Wow, these are
incredibly beautiful.

28:31.310 --> 28:35.981
Tell me about that.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.084
Amber, coral, shells.

28:39.085 --> 28:39.651
These used to be currency.

28:39.652 --> 28:41.219
These shells.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.254
How old is this?

28:43.255 --> 28:44.489
Early '20s.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.391
The Amber is millions
of years old.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.527
How much are you selling it for?

28:49.528 --> 28:51.096
By weight.

28:51.097 --> 28:56.267
Quite heavy piece
this one, 429 grams.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.369
So it comes like 42,000
so that's how much in

28:58.370 --> 28:59.404
dollars?

28:59.405 --> 29:03.041
Almost $5,000.

29:03.042 --> 29:03.542
About $5,000.

29:03.543 --> 29:04.543
Almost.

29:04.544 --> 29:06.077
Should we look at another floor?

29:06.078 --> 29:11.316
Oh, yes, follow me.

29:11.317 --> 29:17.288
There's a nice collection
of things from the Sahara.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.323
So you travel a lot?

29:18.324 --> 29:21.459
Not like you.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.096
Oh, this is for pounding...
Yes, this is from the Gon

29:25.097 --> 29:26.131
tribe.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.232
From Mali.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.766
How much will this
sell for do you think?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.835
Around $300.

29:29.836 --> 29:30.836
Really?

29:30.837 --> 29:32.971
For this?

29:32.972 --> 29:35.540
That's very reasonable.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.574
I'll be buying that.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.676
That's going to
be an old friend.

29:38.677 --> 29:39.710
Also memory.

29:39.711 --> 29:44.415
Also memory of Tangier as well.

29:44.416 --> 29:49.787
Majid suggests lunch at
Andalus, a locals only place

29:49.788 --> 29:54.692
nearby.

29:54.693 --> 29:55.760
As a Moroccan, so many people

29:55.761 --> 29:56.794
come with a romantic notion of a

29:56.795 --> 29:58.363
Tangier they read
about in books.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.432
Do people have a
realistic expectation?

30:01.433 --> 30:02.901
Are they looking for Morocco or

30:02.902 --> 30:07.338
are they looking
for this phantasm?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.373
It is a phantasm.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.440
It is.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.441
When you get here, you know

30:10.442 --> 30:11.576
Morocco, you feel that you are

30:11.577 --> 30:13.644
in Morocco but you are not.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.314
There's a lot of Mediterranean
attached to this town.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.815
Also the history, people hear

30:17.816 --> 30:19.985
story about Tangier that it

30:19.986 --> 30:21.987
was... when I first came in the

30:21.988 --> 30:24.655
'60s, everybody said
that you came late.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.192
Right.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.260
Now I'm saying the same
thing as the young now.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.761
They come and they
saw wow, I say...

30:30.762 --> 30:34.432
What was better
about those days?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.001
Well, for me at that time I

30:36.002 --> 30:39.137
was young, and it was the boom

30:39.138 --> 30:42.240
of hippies, and it
was a destination.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.842
You know, cafe Baba, meet Bob

30:44.843 --> 30:47.445
Dylan, and the parties
was going on.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.048
I miss these kind of parties.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.616
People fly from everywhere to

30:51.617 --> 30:55.786
the party, and they make
the whole town move.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.356
Blue and white party, white and

30:58.357 --> 31:01.559
gold party, hat party,
you know, it's amazing.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.695
You see people coming in with

31:04.696 --> 31:05.664
amazing hats, like a cage with a

31:05.665 --> 31:09.400
bird, extravagant
hats, you know.

31:09.401 --> 31:10.036
They put so much energy and time

31:10.037 --> 31:11.970
into the parties, you know?

31:11.971 --> 31:19.710
Look at... now, that looks good.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.346
Tomatoes brushed with local

31:21.347 --> 31:24.983
olive oil, garlic and coriander.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.051
Liver kabobs, beef liver to be

31:26.052 --> 31:29.154
exact, grilled over charcoal.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.222
That looks very nice.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.959
For fish, a bit of swordfish and

31:33.960 --> 31:37.828
and some orange roughy.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.397
That is just beautiful.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.966
How do you like the tomato?

31:40.967 --> 31:45.203
The swordfish is amazing.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.204
So how else have things changed?

31:46.205 --> 31:48.773
You saw how many tourists
there was today?

31:48.774 --> 31:50.875
They were in a hurry.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.478
If they come to the shop,
even try to avoid your eye

31:53.479 --> 31:55.546
contact.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.648
They afraid if you get my eye

31:57.649 --> 32:01.352
contact, I'm going
to rip you off or...

32:01.353 --> 32:03.554
Or make you buy something
that they don't want?

32:03.555 --> 32:04.555
I don't know.

32:04.556 --> 32:05.091
I don't know.

32:05.092 --> 32:06.092
Do they buy?

32:06.093 --> 32:07.125
They don't even say hello.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.893
They don't buy?

32:08.894 --> 32:09.561
Of course.

32:09.562 --> 32:12.897
We call them penguin.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.766
They have short hands that
don't get into the pockets.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.669
I'm just kidding.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.564
When Tangier was Interzone

32:46.565 --> 32:48.133
back in the day, it seemed to

32:48.134 --> 32:49.167
some I'm sure as if the ex-pats

32:49.168 --> 32:51.302
outnumbered the locals.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.304
That was never true, but you

32:53.305 --> 32:55.406
certainly could live a life

32:55.407 --> 32:59.144
apart, make your own world
within the existing one.

32:59.145 --> 33:03.014
Reinvent yourself and live

33:03.015 --> 33:08.553
entirely within a universe
of your own creation.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.690
Far from the grand socco is
a 14-acre estate owned by

33:12.691 --> 33:14.225
Christopher Gibbs, a well-known

33:14.226 --> 33:17.395
dealer of antiques
and longtime ex-pat.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.465
Today, he's having
a garden party.

hind in a lot of businesses.

gather, and occasionally

33:46.492 --> 33:50.295

magrabbi to English.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.730

33:54.600 --> 33:56.667
has been living and working in

33:56.668 --> 33:58.603
the Kasbah since a hasty exit

33:58.604 --> 34:06.604
from Puerto Rico for reasons
never fully explained.

34:10.116 --> 34:17.388
On the menu, bastilla, a meat or

34:17.389 --> 34:19.989

Moroccan as it gets.

34:26.732 --> 34:27.764
It's chicken slow-cooked, pulled

34:27.766 --> 34:30.368
or shredded and folded
into an egg mixture.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.437
Cooked in a reduced
stock from the boil.

34:32.438 --> 34:36.107
This is layered with blanched

34:36.108 --> 34:39.277
almonds, powdered
sugar, and cinnamon.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.413
The whole lot is wrapped
in a crepe-like dough.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.014
After baking to a golden

34:45.016 --> 34:46.583
crispiness, the final touch is a

34:46.585 --> 34:49.654
dusting of even more
cinnamon and sugar.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.789
It's got a sweet savory thing

35:12.845 --> 35:13.978
When it was quite different.

Everyone wore native dress, but

Islam still the throbbing
motor of life here.

from Morocco and the
