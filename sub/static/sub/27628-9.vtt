WEBVTT

00:11.360 --> 00:12.720
Lovely weather.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.960
Oh, yes, it's a bit of a stunner,
isn't it?

00:15.960 --> 00:18.600
How lovely, you're very lucky.Yes.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.600
The luckiest girl in all the county,
aren't I, Daddy?

00:24.800 --> 00:27.720
Weather's held out,
set fair for the wedding.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.680
Not again.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.480 --> 00:49.680
Shooting the messenger?

00:52.240 --> 00:53.360
Misunderstanding.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.400
Damn hawkers.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.040
If you tell me, if you let me help.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.120
Back to your fiancee, now. There's
a good girl.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.080
I will ruin you.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.520
Surely we're not travelling
in that?

01:55.520 --> 01:56.960
That's what they've always used,

01:56.960 --> 02:00.600
and I can't see them changing it
just for you.Well...No, no.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.680
We are not leaving you at home,

02:03.680 --> 02:06.440
not after that business with the
Earl's son

02:06.440 --> 02:08.720
splashed all over the newspapers.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.680
Mr Fawlter.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.200
Morning, Father.

02:16.360 --> 02:22.760
Ladies.Father.Inspector Mallory, I
had no idea you were a rambler.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.240
I'm not.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.600
It's the birdwatching
you've come for?

02:34.800 --> 02:38.400
He's behind with the Chief Super's
Community Engagement Plan.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.040
We get a point for each activity.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.280
Community engagement, my eye.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.800
BUNTY:How many points for traipsing
across the countryside

02:45.800 --> 02:52.200
with half the village?Hello, is
everyone here? Jolly good.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.360
It's very exciting this year,
our first overnighter,

02:56.360 --> 02:59.640
so as chair of the Kembleford
Ramblers Association,

02:59.640 --> 03:02.320
I'd like to welcome old
friends, and new,

03:02.320 --> 03:05.280
on our annual
Ramblers and Twitchers outing!

03:08.080 --> 03:10.920
You'd have to feel sorry for
Norman Fawlter.Why?

03:11.920 --> 03:15.840
Because Cathy Fawlter has been thick
as thieves

03:15.840 --> 03:18.640
with young Randall Jones there since
he arrived in Kembleford.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.720
Odd job man indeed.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.320
We probably shouldn't speculate.
Just observing, Father.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.840
There is a world of difference.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.680
Well, this hotel had better
be half-decent.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.760
Nothing like being out in
the countryside.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.680
Absolutely nothing like it.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.720
There's a picnic spot along the
River Windrush, we'll stop there.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.920
We should be able to cover the first
four miles before lunch.Splendid.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.000
You sure about that short cut,
Cathy?Quite sure. Don't worry.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.280
For goodness' sake! That's a
skylark, isn't it, Mr Fawlter?

04:23.280 --> 04:26.400
Yes, that's right. There he goes.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.040
"Higher still and higher, from the
earth thou springest", Shelley.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.920
Ode To A Skylark.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.400
"We look before and after...

04:36.440 --> 04:39.440
"..and pine for what is not."

04:39.440 --> 04:42.040
What did I tell you?
Thick as thieves.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.400
If we cut through, we'll
avoid the road.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.360
Hang on. Can't you read?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.720
Come on, stragglers!
Don't say I didn't warn you.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.160
Mrs M! Keep low, everyone.
What did I tell you?

05:03.160 --> 05:05.120
Oi, you! Cut it out!

05:06.360 --> 05:08.880
Randall! He's down!
Oi! Stop shooting!

05:11.120 --> 05:12.640
Oh, no. He's bleeding.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.400
Thankfully, the shot only
grazed him.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.960
May I ask you to put down your gun?

05:16.960 --> 05:19.160
Yes. At once! Or I'll have
you arrested.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.480
Thought you were pheasants.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.760
Eyesight not what it was.
You could have killed someone.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.520
It's rock salt, you fool.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.880
I am Inspector Mallory...

05:25.880 --> 05:28.520
I don't care who you are,
you're trespassing.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.040
There's a footpath, we've got a
right, look for yourself.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.240
It is an offence to have in your
possession any firearm

05:36.240 --> 05:38.680
or ammunition with intent
to endanger...

05:38.680 --> 05:41.000
Oh, Daddy wouldn't have intended
anything, honestly.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.400
I've warned you about this!

05:42.400 --> 05:43.680
They were off the path.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.320
MRS McCARTHY:You saw
that, all right!

05:46.880 --> 05:49.200
Bunty?Hetty?

05:49.200 --> 05:51.200
I don't believe it!

05:52.760 --> 05:55.040
Darling, is that a back pack?

05:56.400 --> 05:59.960
You poor thing, here, let me.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.160
Hetty and I went to boarding
school together.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.560
I saw you in the papers with that
Earl's son, you naughty thing.

06:06.560 --> 06:08.640
Same old Bunty!

06:08.640 --> 06:11.320
Listen, you absolutely must stay
for tea.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.520
Stay the night.Oh, Het, that would
be...Impossible, I'm afraid.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.920
We are expected elsewhere.
Oh, shame.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.280
Awfully dull around here
since I got engaged...

06:22.280 --> 06:25.240
Congrats, darling! To a
perfectly dull Duke.Oh...

06:25.240 --> 06:27.120
CATHY:Well, it seems we're safe
to continue.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.640
If you can refrain from shooting,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.960
we will endeavour to keep to
the marked paths.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.400
Damn interfering priest.

06:36.400 --> 06:40.080
We could always take the road.
We're taking the path.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.400
There will be a pile of sandwiches
waiting, if I know Mrs Kendall.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.640
Blisters. Blisters everywhere.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.080
BUNTY:Youth Hostel?
I've been duped.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.760
Oh, I've been so looking
forward to seeing you.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.960
It's been how many years?
You haven't changed a bit.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.360
Oh, I think I have.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.280
I wondered when I'd ever
see you again.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.200
Well, it's marvellous walking
out here.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.760
This is my husband, Norman.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.960
Hello.So good to meet you,
Mrs Kendall.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.000
Father Brown, Mrs McCarthy, Miss
Windermere. And our friend. Randall.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.440
Well, you're all very welcome.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.520
All of you. Any friend of Cathy's.
Come in, come in.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.880
We've tea waiting and all the
dorms are prepared.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.280
Dorms?

07:46.040 --> 07:47.840
They lock the doors at nine.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.440
I'm telling you, Hetty,
it's worse than boarding school.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.720
Why so keen to provoke
Hollingworth, then?

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
Leave it, Norman, please.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.840
What am I supposed to do, Cathy,
when you keep me on the outside?

08:00.920 --> 08:03.480
Perhaps you'd all like
some cocoa now?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.400
I remember how you loved
crumpets, Cathy.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.600
Thank you, Mrs Kendall.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.920
BIRD TWEETS

08:15.920 --> 08:20.320
Could be a sedge warbler?
Yes, Sergeant. Possibly.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.640
Or a chaffinch, maybe?
Mr Fawlter would know.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.360
This is a prison, not a hostel.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.160
I am quite literally being
held prisoner.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.520
SNORING

08:59.680 --> 09:03.080
Doors locked, lights out,
it's not even dark yet.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.800
Hetty! There's a party in town.
It's going to be wild.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.800
Get a move on.Hang on.

09:25.600 --> 09:30.040
I can't! Have you forgotten
everything you learnt at school?

09:44.080 --> 09:46.640
It'd be really awkward if
I break my...

09:48.600 --> 09:50.000
..leg.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.760
Are you all right?

10:00.800 --> 10:05.240
Have you brought me some clothes?
What a trouper! Of course I have.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.520
That doesn't sound like a
sedge warbler.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.680
Help! Help!

11:10.720 --> 11:13.560
Is he dead...?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.640
Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine...
Excuse me!

11:17.640 --> 11:19.160
..et lux perpetua luceat ei.

11:23.840 --> 11:28.360
He's dead.Requiescat in pace. Amen.
Strangled, I'd say.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.600
Someone hit him, too. On the back of
the head, and in the face.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.640
Thank you, Padre, I'm not blind.
It's obviously from where he fell.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.240
Looks like they used a rope.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.240
What are those marks on the neck?

11:43.240 --> 11:47.360
Will you give me some room?
Father, oh, excuse me, excuse me.

11:50.160 --> 11:56.400
Father, I can't find Penelope
anywhere! Oh, my goodness.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.360
He's not...? Oh, heavens above.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.800
That means there's a killer on
the loose.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.040
We have to report her as
a missing person.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.200
I'll rouse the local constabulary.
Thank you, Sergeant.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.760
And after your cocoa with
Mrs Fawlter and Mrs Kendall?

12:21.760 --> 12:25.560
I went to read in the lounge.
Until after lights out?

12:25.560 --> 12:28.560
They have some excellent
ornithology books.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.320
And you returned to find the
body at what time?

12:32.320 --> 12:33.760
It was gone 11.30.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.440
I couldn't sleep, a hot milk
always settles me.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.280
What on earth was
Lord Hollingworth doing here?

12:41.280 --> 12:44.240
You knew him?He used to be the
patron of the Skylark.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.320
I'll ask the questions, Padre.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.520
You weren't in the dorm at
lights out.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.640
What are you all doing up?

12:58.640 --> 13:00.640
We were worried sick about you!

13:00.640 --> 13:03.600
Keep your hair on, Mrs M, we were
only at a party in Cheltenham.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.120
You were only at a party in...

13:08.120 --> 13:11.680
after everything that has happened
here tonight, and...What?

13:15.120 --> 13:19.040
I'm sorry to have to ask these
questions, Miss Hollingworth.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.920
Couldn't it wait til
morning, Inspector?

13:21.920 --> 13:25.080
Did you notice anything strange when
you arrived at the hostel?

13:28.360 --> 13:30.560
At - just after nine, you said?
Nine?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.760
You didn't pick me up
until 9:30.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.800
Actually, there is
something, Inspector.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.960
Yes, Miss Hollingworth?

13:37.960 --> 13:42.880
When I arrived at the Skylark, I saw
my father outside the hostel.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.560
You saw Lord Hollingworth?

13:45.560 --> 13:48.120
He was heading round the back.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.160
I waited in my car for a moment.
And then I followed him.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.920
And why did you do that?
I was worried.

13:56.400 --> 14:01.440
He'd taken a call earlier in the
evening, and he seemed agitated.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.960
Go on, Miss Hollingworth.
He went inside.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.480
Was the door unlocked?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.360
I don't know, he just went in.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.720
I heard voices. An argument.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.280
How dare you threaten me?

14:14.280 --> 14:16.440
I think it's about time you
admitted the truth.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.680
I've had enough of your
little games.Daddy?

14:20.200 --> 14:21.680
What the hell are you doing here?

14:21.680 --> 14:22.880
I could ask you the same.

14:22.880 --> 14:28.680
Did you follow me?Not exactly.
Go home. This does not concern you.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.720
I said go home.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.040
And then I went to pick up Bunty.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.960
And you're certain it was the two
individuals here?

14:39.960 --> 14:44.280
Absolutely positive.
Thank you, Miss Hollingworth.

14:44.280 --> 14:48.400
I'm sorry to have troubled you,
under the circumstances.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.320
What was the argument about?

14:51.360 --> 14:52.400
I've no idea.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.560
Hetty didn't mention seeing
her father.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.360
Or that she was inside the Skylark.

14:59.360 --> 15:03.000
You think she's covering
something up?Seems like it.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Although I don't think she could
possibly be involved in the murder,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.760
she adored her father.
How did she seem?

15:09.760 --> 15:12.120
Same old Hetty, really.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.920
Perhaps a little giddy.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.480
Are you sure that wasn't the
alcohol at that party of yours?

15:16.480 --> 15:19.200
Stick close to her. See what you
can tease out.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.120
I don't know if this is pertinent,

15:24.120 --> 15:27.160
but I saw Cathy and Norman
arguing earlier.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.760
They mentioned Hollingworth.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.120
Darling, where are you going?

15:33.120 --> 15:36.560
I need to be at home.No, you're
in shock.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.440
I'll drive you when it's light.
Come on.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.000
I'm not sure I quite trust
that young lady.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.200
Mrs Fawlter!

15:49.640 --> 15:53.400
I didn't say anything because I
didn't want Randall in trouble.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.960
Why would Randall be in trouble?

15:54.960 --> 15:57.680
Everyone saw how furious he was
after being shot at.

15:58.800 --> 16:03.520
And who can blame him?What is your
relationship with Randall Jones?

16:05.040 --> 16:06.440
I don't see that's relevant here.

16:08.240 --> 16:12.080
So you were arguing about the
trespassing, it got heated,

16:12.080 --> 16:14.360
and your Randall Jones launched
a revenge attack.

16:14.360 --> 16:19.200
No, he didn't, you've got
it all wrong!

16:28.480 --> 16:29.520
Mrs Kendall...

16:32.000 --> 16:36.160
Thought I'd tidy up a bit.
Sorry, Father, I'll leave you.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.600
Tell me, are all the doors locked
at 9pm?

16:39.600 --> 16:41.960
Yes, yes, they are.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.160
What about the back door?

16:44.160 --> 16:47.920
I must have forgotten,
with all the excitement.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.600
It was so good to see Cathy again.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.360
Did she come here often
when she was young?Quite often.

16:54.840 --> 16:58.440
For this to happen tonight,
of all the nights.

16:58.440 --> 17:02.040
A terrible shock,
finding Lord Hollingworth.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.400
It's not me I'm sorry for,
it's Cathy,

17:04.400 --> 17:08.839
and all of you, here on your trip.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.920
I wish you'd said something
last night.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.960
About your father.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.079
Do you mind awfully if we don't go
over all this again, Bunty?

17:25.280 --> 17:27.599
My head is splitting,
I can't think straight.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.680
Actually, I might go and freshen up.
Wait here for me, will you?

17:33.680 --> 17:34.840
Of course.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.360
Adores her father, indeed.

17:45.360 --> 17:50.360
I have never met a more calculating
young lady in all my born days.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.560
"Oh, yes Inspector, there was
something, now I think about it".

17:56.360 --> 17:58.960
Don't think you're being a
bit hasty?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.280
She had Penelope climb out
of the window!

18:03.080 --> 18:06.640
Bunty is quite capable of getting
into scrapes on her own,

18:06.640 --> 18:08.160
don't you think?

18:08.160 --> 18:12.560
And she was very cagey about what
time she arrived at the Skylark,

18:12.560 --> 18:15.000
you heard her yourself.
That doesn't make her a killer.

18:16.280 --> 18:20.240
All I can say is, I hope you've
done the right thing

18:20.240 --> 18:22.080
allowing Penelope to drive her home.

18:23.080 --> 18:27.280
And as for your theory,
I see no car anywhere.

18:27.280 --> 18:31.040
Hollingworth Hall is four
miles from here.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.360
I doubt Lord Hollingworth walked
here last night.

18:34.360 --> 18:38.040
Oh, you're surely not telling me
that Miss Hollingworth was

18:38.040 --> 18:39.280
telling a lie?

18:40.480 --> 18:41.480
Et voila!

19:00.320 --> 19:02.680
If this is Lord Hollingworth's
car...

19:06.960 --> 19:09.760
..then Lord Hollingworth certainly
didn't want to be seen

19:09.760 --> 19:11.360
approaching the Skylark.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.640
Would you look at this?

19:17.600 --> 19:20.360
It's the map Randall thrust at him.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.080
That's the Skylark?And that's the
school.And a convent.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.440
Perhaps Randall was sending
Lord Hollingworth a message?

19:33.440 --> 19:36.680
I'm going to see what I can find
out about those places.

19:36.680 --> 19:41.840
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy, and I will
have a word with Randall Jones.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.240
Hello? Who am I speaking to? I see.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.920
Is there someone there
called Dora Smith?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.600
Thanks for finding that.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.320
Do step away from the telephone, you
know what a good shot I am.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.520
It's not your fault, Cathy.
I gave him the map, didn't I?

21:32.520 --> 21:34.800
We should tell the police.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.280
If they know who you are...

21:36.280 --> 21:37.960
It'll only make it worse.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.720
No, Randall, please don't...
Oi! Head him off at the road.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.800
As if that pair have a hope in
hell of catching him!

21:51.800 --> 21:54.440
If he wants to make himself
look guilty,

21:54.440 --> 21:56.960
he's going the right way about it.
He isn't guilty.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.440
Running away will make him
a suspect.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.520
If he's innocent,
the truth will only help him.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.040
I know where he might head to.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.440
Father Brown, would you come
with me?

22:08.440 --> 22:10.600
Persuade him to give himself up?

22:14.840 --> 22:18.920
All right. Let's think about
this logically.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.080
I don't think you're actually
going to shoot me,

22:22.080 --> 22:24.240
and you can't keep me here for ever.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.200
Well, perhaps there's a civilised
way of dealing with this.

22:29.360 --> 22:33.320
You can't pay me off! Really? That's
not the Bunty I know.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.280
He can't have got far.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.520
Why didn't you look where I
was going?Sorry, Sir.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.480
I see something.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.880
Come on!

22:55.040 --> 22:57.240
That inspector thinks I'm
the bee's knees.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.400
I'll simply deny it if you
go to the police.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.440
We can't afford a scandal.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.400
And if there's no actual evidence...

23:03.400 --> 23:05.880
That number was for a
convent school.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.280
This Dora Smith must have
quite a story.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.640
Sorry, old thing,
you aren't thinking straight.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.400
Now, hand me those letters.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.680
Thank you so much.

23:22.680 --> 23:26.000
Now, you don't happen to have any
rope handy, do you?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.640
There's a twitchers' hide out here.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.920
I brought Randall once,
when he first came to the village.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.880
Mr Jones clearly means a lot to you.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.880
He did some odd jobs for us,
he became a friend.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.000
Why did he give Lord Hollingworth
that map?I don't know.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.600
There's the hide, by those bushes.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.360
I don't wish to pry, but
Miss Windermere said that you

23:48.360 --> 23:51.760
and your husband were heard
arguing last night.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.480
Oh, he's there! Randall!

23:53.480 --> 23:56.320
It's all right, it's all right, I've
brought Father Brown!

23:56.320 --> 23:57.600
It's no good, Cathy.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.560
Please, if we explain.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.480
Who's going to believe me?

24:03.480 --> 24:06.600
I messed up, Father.
All my life's been the same,

24:06.600 --> 24:09.840
but you just keep Cathy out of
this, all right?

24:09.840 --> 24:11.720
She's been through enough.

24:11.720 --> 24:15.240
Stop there, lad! Mr Jones, it
would..Gotcha.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.680
Randall Jones, I am arresting you on
suspicion of murder.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.600
You are not obliged to say anything,

24:19.600 --> 24:21.480
but anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.520
Have you any connection with
Lord Hollingworth?

24:30.520 --> 24:32.520
Yes, yes, that's right. Oh, I see.

24:36.040 --> 24:39.160
And when was that,
if you don't mind my asking?

24:39.160 --> 24:43.240
Sorry to interrupt,
the charabanc's arrived.

24:43.240 --> 24:46.760
Well, thank you very much indeed,
Sister. Goodbye.

24:49.440 --> 24:53.000
Mrs Kendall, when did Lord
Hollingworth stop being patron here?

24:54.040 --> 24:56.680
About 15 years ago, I think. Why?

25:05.480 --> 25:08.400
You're taking me to the police?Now,
you know I'm not a snitch, darling.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.520
I'm taking you to see Father Brown.
Well, this is awkward.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.920
You'd better play along, darling, if
you don't want me

25:15.920 --> 25:17.160
to hand over those letters.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.920
Miss Hollingworth, Miss Windermere.
Inspector.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.800
What the devil's going on?

25:30.040 --> 25:34.360
I was just trying to distract Hetty
after everything she's been through.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.040
What? By tying her up?

25:36.040 --> 25:40.080
Yes...erm... we were just reliving
an old school game,

25:40.080 --> 25:43.480
such larks, honestly, we pretended
to be kidnapped.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.240
Weren't we, Hetty?

25:47.120 --> 25:49.840
We take it in turns to be
tied, you see.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.920
I got the short straw.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.120
Or the long, depending on which
way you look at it.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.160
In one version, we're rescued
by policemen.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.960
Right, well, yes. Goodfellow,
what are you waiting for?

26:02.960 --> 26:04.680
Two devilishly handsome policemen.

26:08.240 --> 26:09.840
What the hell are you playing
at, man!

26:11.680 --> 26:14.160
Well, if he didn't think you were
the bee's knees before...

26:22.520 --> 26:24.800
Would you say you had a hot temper?

26:24.800 --> 26:28.160
You were furious, weren't you,
when Lord Hollingworth shot at you?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.760
Why didn't you mention seeing
Hollingworth before he was murdered?

26:38.800 --> 26:41.840
How old are you, Randall? 23?

26:41.840 --> 26:43.000
Colourful life so far,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.480
what with those convictions for
larceny and housebreaking.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.840
I was starving,
that's why I broke in.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.800
Like I say, hot temper.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.640
So when Hollingworth saw you
and Cathy together...

27:01.640 --> 27:05.800
Nobody's judging, Randall,
private life's your own.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.600
But when Hollingworth let rip at
your lover, you got mad, didn't you?

27:13.600 --> 27:16.680
You wanted him to suffer, his life
of privilege compared to yours?

27:16.680 --> 27:19.280
No, that's not how it was,
all right!

27:19.280 --> 27:21.280
I hit him, but I didn't kill him.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.840
If he were patron of the girls'
approved school...

27:28.840 --> 27:31.880
As well as the convent
and the Skylark.

27:31.880 --> 27:36.320
Then why give up the patronage of
all three at exactly the same time?

27:37.600 --> 27:38.880
In you go, darling.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.520
What on earth...?

27:41.520 --> 27:44.200
So much for the countryside keeping
me out of trouble, Mrs M!

27:47.840 --> 27:52.880
Was your father interested in birds?
Not unless he could shoot them.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.240
So who is...?Dora Smith?

27:55.240 --> 27:58.760
I was just about to get to that
when I was held at gunpoint.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.880
I couldn't see another option.
Apology accepted!

28:05.520 --> 28:07.760
Do these locations mean
anything to you?

28:08.840 --> 28:10.360
Should they?

28:10.360 --> 28:12.920
What did you know about your
father's charitable works?

28:12.920 --> 28:17.360
He was patron of a few
organisations a while back.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.400
And Dora Smith?

28:22.880 --> 28:24.680
I suppose you'll find out
soon enough.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.440
She worked at the convent school.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.280
And she was blackmailing
your father?Not exactly.

28:30.280 --> 28:33.800
Look, I know my father wasn't
entirely... yes, he had his faults,

28:33.800 --> 28:37.680
but he didn't deserve
to be murdered.

28:37.680 --> 28:41.560
So you must want the truth to
come out, Hetty!

28:41.560 --> 28:44.800
It can be hard to accept that
someone we love can be

28:44.800 --> 28:46.640
capable of hurting others.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.880
But every human being,
without doubt,

28:50.880 --> 28:55.480
is worth more than the worst of
their actions.

28:57.920 --> 29:02.560
He fell after you hit him,
didn't he?I can't remember.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.120
I think so.There was blood on the
back of his skull.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.320
Look, he was alive, I swear it!

29:07.320 --> 29:10.520
He was weakened by the blow,
by hitting his head,

29:10.520 --> 29:13.080
and you couldn't stop yourself...
No...You strangled him.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.240
He deserved to die, that old
hypocrite! But I didn't kill him.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.160
Do you hear me? I didn't do it!

29:21.880 --> 29:25.760
Randall Jones, you will be formally
charged for the murder

29:25.760 --> 29:27.680
of Lord Henry Hollingworth.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.160
There was almost a scandal before
Mummy died, a convent girl.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.960
When was this?About 15
years ago.

29:46.160 --> 29:50.720
She made these accusations, Mummy
was sure it was nonsense,

29:50.720 --> 29:54.600
but the girl was threatening the
press and all sorts,

29:54.600 --> 29:56.040
so she was paid off.

29:57.480 --> 30:00.560
Is that why you needed the
perfectly dull Duke?

30:00.560 --> 30:02.560
Hollingworth Hall was under threat?

30:02.560 --> 30:05.120
Oh, we've been on our
uppers for years,

30:05.120 --> 30:07.880
it's frightfully expensive
to maintain.

30:08.920 --> 30:12.600
But when Daddy shot at whoever
brought that book,

30:12.600 --> 30:18.360
I knew something was... I found the
letters, phoned Dora Smith.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.280
She said there were others,

30:23.280 --> 30:25.040
and that she was a witness.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.080
No wonder he wanted to
marry you off.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.360
Did you confront your father?No.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.320
I didn't want to believe it.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.640
We need to take this to the police.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.000
What's the use of
stirring it all up?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.640
They've got their man, haven't they?

30:40.640 --> 30:43.360
What makes you think that Randall
would have killed your father?

30:46.400 --> 30:48.760
Het, did you have anything to
do with this?

30:48.760 --> 30:51.760
Only it must have been devastating
to find out about all of it...

30:51.760 --> 30:54.240
What do you take me for?
He's my father!

30:56.440 --> 31:00.800
He was?I'm sorry. Of course.
Had to ask.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.320
You told the police

31:03.320 --> 31:07.520
Lord Hollingworth received a
telephone call earlier that evening.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.840
Do you remember anything about it?

31:11.560 --> 31:13.720
I won't be ruined by some harlot!

31:20.560 --> 31:22.400
Then I went to pick up Bunty.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.680
'She's been through enough.'.Sorry?

31:28.080 --> 31:30.160
Something young Randall said.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.200
Het, if there's any chance that
Randall is innocent,

31:35.200 --> 31:38.160
you don't want that on
your conscience.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.520
You may have more in common with
Randall Jones than you think.

31:46.760 --> 31:47.760
Excuse me.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.680
Father?

32:19.840 --> 32:23.080
Mrs Fawlter.What's happened?

32:25.680 --> 32:28.320
May I speak with you?
Alone, if possible?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.760
What on earth happened to your car,
Mrs Fawlter?

32:48.760 --> 32:53.680
Oh, um, it was the neighbour's
son, catapult.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.880
Were you and Randall Jones
blackmailing Lord Hollingworth?

32:59.880 --> 33:03.200
What? Don't be absurd!

33:05.200 --> 33:08.840
You wanted Mr Jones to tell the
police who he really was.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.720
Randall's your son, isn't he?

33:13.960 --> 33:15.480
That's absolutely...

33:17.080 --> 33:20.760
I told you, he's a friend.

33:20.760 --> 33:25.160
This must be extremely difficult for
you, Mrs Fawlter,

33:25.160 --> 33:28.960
you were very young when Lord
Hollingworth took advantage of you.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.920
I was 15.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.240
We'd like to speak to
Inspector Mallory, please.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.440
If he's not tied up.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.920
Inspector!

34:06.080 --> 34:07.240
What now?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.440
I do hope you're not easily shocked.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.639
I wanted a better life for Randall.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.080
So the walk over his land...?

34:33.080 --> 34:35.239
Was meant as a warning.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.920
And later you telephoned
Lord Hollingworth from the Skylark?

34:38.920 --> 34:41.320
Yes, I threatened him with the
police if he didn't pay up.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.719
I had the testimony of Dora Smith,

34:45.719 --> 34:49.360
and others. I didn't expect him to
turn up at the Skylark.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.440
No-one will believe your slander.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.040
They'll know you're after my money.

34:57.040 --> 34:58.800
Money for your son!

35:00.400 --> 35:02.080
I had to give him away.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.760
What kind of a life do you
think he's had?

35:06.360 --> 35:08.440
Oi! I'll ruin you,
and all the others like you.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.040
Randall was defending me.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.360
How much does Mr Fawlter know
about all this?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.360
Nothing about the blackmail.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.520
Catherine Fawlter, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Lord Hollingworth.

35:28.520 --> 35:30.280
What?We know all about these.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.720
You're not obliged to say anything,

35:32.720 --> 35:35.080
but anything you say may be
given in evidence.

35:35.080 --> 35:39.360
I am sure that you are mistaken.
Stay out of this, Padre.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.160
I telephoned Dora Smith.

35:41.160 --> 35:44.720
She soon crumbled once she realised
we were onto the extortion racket.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.920
No, you don't understand.
Randall's my son.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.960
The perfect motive.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.760
You and Randall Jones planned to
murder Lord Hollingworth when

35:56.760 --> 35:59.520
he wouldn't pay up.You cannot
honestly think Cathy would...?

35:59.520 --> 36:02.040
Best let us do our job, sir.
Goodfellow. This way...

36:03.560 --> 36:06.080
I don't blame anyone but
Hollingworth, Father. No-one!

36:07.760 --> 36:09.240
It was Hollingworth all along.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.600
But she didn't kill anyone.
She couldn't.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.640
It wasn't Cathy, it was me.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.640
I did it.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.680
How did you kill him, Mr Fawlter?
I strangled him.With what?

36:26.360 --> 36:29.960
I lost my temper and...
Wait, I hit him first...

36:29.960 --> 36:32.760
Your desire to protect
Mrs Fawlter is admirable.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.160
But if you impede the investigation

36:35.160 --> 36:39.720
when the real suspect is still at
large...I can't just stand by!

36:39.720 --> 36:41.080
Can I borrow your telephone?

36:53.720 --> 36:56.720
She insisted on coming too.
Well, if it's about my father.

36:56.720 --> 37:00.920
Thank you, Bunty. Het.
Going twitching?

37:23.480 --> 37:25.120
Mrs Kendall?

37:25.120 --> 37:27.200
Goodness, you gave me a fright.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.000
Did you forget something?
I checked the dorms.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.360
The marks on Lord
Hollingworth's neck.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.480
They were from the focus wheel.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.000
Whose are those?They belong to
Mr Fawlter.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.160
I remembered you put them back on
his bedside table.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.800
But surely you don't think
Norman killed him?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.360
I wondered at first.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.880
He almost confessed when the
police arrested his wife.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.720
They've arrested Cathy?

37:59.720 --> 38:03.480
Both her and Mr Jones are now in
police custody.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.080
So two innocent people may hang.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.600
But if they were
Norman's binoculars...

38:12.600 --> 38:15.360
Mrs Kendall, you didn't forget to
lock up.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.520
Lord Hollingworth had a key.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.400
He must have made it very hard
for you to say no.

38:27.480 --> 38:32.080
When did Mrs Fawlter first tell you
she'd had a child by Hollingworth?

38:38.040 --> 38:42.880
I didn't know what he was doing,
not at first.

38:59.480 --> 39:03.160
I should have known you'd be in
league with the harlots.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.200
Cathy's not the harlot, you're the
disgrace! You disgust me!

39:09.280 --> 39:11.280
If I'm disgusting, so are you.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.160
Who gave me the key?

39:16.840 --> 39:21.080
I should thank you. How could I ever
have managed without you?

39:22.960 --> 39:25.000
We're the same, you and I.

39:34.680 --> 39:38.840
Hollingworth told me if he went
down, so would I.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.600
I was scared.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.320
Norman left his binoculars.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.680
I did it for Cathy and all
the others!

39:56.120 --> 39:57.320
I'm glad he's dead.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.800
I'm glad... All those girls.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.960
You let it happen!
We tried to stop him.

40:04.960 --> 40:09.240
Mr Fawlter...
You helped him abuse her.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.560
No, I cared for Cathy.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.200
She must have known he was a
monster all along.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.680
Not all of it, I didn't, honestly,
he was a good father.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.920
She was 15.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.720
This won't help your wife.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.440
Your wife says she blames
no-one for this.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.960
She has already forgiven
Mrs Kendall.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.680
You were driven by self-hatred

40:41.680 --> 40:44.360
as much as hatred for
Lord Hollingworth.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.440
You can set your soul free at last.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.560
God will forgive you.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.720
I won't let Cathy hang.

41:00.920 --> 41:05.040
I won't. I won't.
You'll confess to the police?

41:17.880 --> 41:21.840
Lemonade...?Thank you,
Miss Hollingworth.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.880
And what will you do once
the hall is sold?

41:24.880 --> 41:27.160
Now that you've ditched your
perfectly dull Duke?

41:28.440 --> 41:30.000
I don't know. Travel?

41:30.000 --> 41:33.080
Or perhaps I'll find a nice little
cottage in Kembleford and

41:33.080 --> 41:35.680
some delightful children to be
a governess to.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.840
Oh, you came!

41:46.840 --> 41:49.600
Miss Hollingworth.Hetty, please, we
are related after all.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.880
There's a stack of scones to eat.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.960
You sure you're all right?

41:55.960 --> 41:58.880
It's very kind of you to invite us.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.920
But this trust for Randall and I,
we couldn't accept.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.240
You could.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.600
It's the least I can do.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.640
So glad you could make
it, Inspector.Ah, it's my pleasure.

42:14.640 --> 42:19.680
You'll know plenty of faces. There's
even some you haven't arrested(!)

42:23.480 --> 42:27.800
Very good of Miss Hollingworth to
help Cathy and the other women,

42:27.800 --> 42:30.680
with the proceeds from the Hall.
She has a good heart.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.640
You don't really think she's going
to settle in Kembleford?

42:37.560 --> 42:41.280
Do you worry about her influence
on Penelope?No, no.

42:42.800 --> 42:47.080
I always thought she was a good and
conscientious girl, underneath.

42:49.920 --> 42:55.080
Penelope? Where are you going?
Don't wait up, Mrs M!

42:55.200 --> 42:56.240
Penelope!
