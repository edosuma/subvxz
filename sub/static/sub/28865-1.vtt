00:05.136 --> 00:06.072
<i>I'm Gary.</i>

00:06.112 --> 00:07.684
<i>A lot of people on Reddit
think I'm annoying.</i>

00:07.685 --> 00:09.652
<i>Well,

00:09.687 --> 00:11.516

- Chookity.</i>

00:16.073 --> 00:18.109

planet destroying super weapon.</i>

00:18.144 --> 00:19.558
<i>My best friend Avocato,</i>

00:19.559 --> 00:21.699
<i>a gruff, tough, little
bit rough bounty hunter,</i>

00:21.733 --> 00:23.424

00:23.525 --> 00:25.665
<i>His son Little Cato,

<i>And Clarence, someone I hope
to never meet again.</i>

00:35.477 --> 00:37.366
<i>I never thought someone like
me would be saving the world.</i>

00:37.401 --> 00:39.782
<i>It's tricky because...
no one teaches you how.</i>

00:39.817 --> 00:43.510
<i>You just meet someone really,
really genuine like Quinn...</i>

00:43.545 --> 00:46.503
<i>and her equally hot
future self, Nightfall.</i>

00:46.538 --> 00:47.410
<i>You hear about
a breach in space</i>

00:47.411 --> 00:48.549
<i>you've got to close or else.</i>

00:48.550 --> 00:51.104

00:51.139 --> 00:52.587

00:52.588 --> 00:54.659

of hope it works out.</i>

00:54.694 --> 00:56.454
<i>That's what happened to me, anyway.</i>

00:56.489 --> 00:58.145
<i>Only it didn't...</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:04.370
<i>...work out.</i>

01:06.292 --> 01:10.399
- Gary.
- No. Don't. Don't say it.

We failed freakin' hard.

H.U.E., where are we?

H.U.E.?
H.U.E.?

02:31.377 --> 02:34.932
- H.U.E.?!
- Sorry, Gary.

02:36.796 --> 02:39.488
This is my first time
inhabiting a shell.

02:39.523 --> 02:42.491
- Is that really you?
- Get off my cheeks, Gary.

02:42.656 --> 02:44.934
Get over here,
you waddling rascal.

02:44.968 --> 02:47.385
Come on over. Come on.
Right here. I'm waiting.

02:49.704 --> 02:51.575
While we're young, H.U.E., please.

02:51.610 --> 02:53.604
Get over here.
Hug me tight, H.U.E.

02:53.639 --> 02:56.607
Hugging, hugging, hugging.

02:56.642 --> 02:57.918
- Okay. Okay. O...
- I missed you so much.

02:57.919 --> 02:59.619
- All right. All right.
- Whoa.

03:01.163 --> 03:03.062
That was the ... that was the
worst hug I've ever received.

03:03.096 --> 03:05.650
Gary, we're about to...
lightfold!

"If you're ready

03:40.337 --> 03:43.650
Oh, that is...
truly disgusting.

03:43.651 --> 03:47.344
- You're disgusting.
- Oh. Oh, God, no.

03:47.378 --> 03:50.312
- Clarence?!
- Surprise.

03:51.659 --> 03:55.317
Well, well, well.
Sorry, primate, to inform you

03:55.352 --> 03:59.839
of the horribly wonderful news
that I now own you.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.945
You don't own me.
No one owns me.

04:01.979 --> 04:04.913
All property gathered
in the Interstellar Null Zone

04:04.948 --> 04:08.641
belongs to he who collects it.
And that "he" is me.

04:08.676 --> 04:12.921
- And that property is you.
- Oh, well, that's great.

04:12.956 --> 04:14.404
And quick, H.U.E., run!

04:19.031 --> 04:21.930
<i>You're not going anywhere!</i>

04:21.964 --> 04:24.208
Whoa!
I can't believe that worked.

04:24.243 --> 04:27.108
Begone, self-doubting
adolescent demon!

04:27.142 --> 04:30.352
Quick, H.U.E., run!
And a little faster this time.

04:30.387 --> 04:31.870
Sprint mode engaged.

04:31.871 --> 04:35.116
Come on, H.U.E.!
Put the pedal to the metal!

04:39.396 --> 04:41.363
Oh.
Now, that scares me.

04:41.398 --> 04:46.230
Ah, I see you've met Fox
and Ash, my darling children.

04:46.265 --> 04:48.094
Just to clarify ...
did any of you spring

04:48.129 --> 04:52.374
- from that hobgoblin's wiener?!
- We were adopted!

04:52.409 --> 04:55.049
Which means it hurts
my feelings when people

04:55.050 --> 04:57.690
run away from me without
giving me a chance.

05:01.452 --> 05:03.902
Mm-hmm. That's great.
Okay, Clarence.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.421
Now it's time for you
and your robot annoyance

05:05.422 --> 05:07.009
to remove your filth.

05:07.010 --> 05:09.184
Wash boy.

05:15.328 --> 05:18.883
- Little Cato?
- Gary?

05:18.884 --> 05:21.714
Thunder Bandit!

05:21.749 --> 05:24.582
My little Spider Cat.

05:24.711 --> 05:28.197
Now, this ... this is a hug.

05:29.957 --> 05:32.615
My body is a nightmare.

05:32.650 --> 05:34.617
Now, how do we get out of here?

05:34.652 --> 05:37.551
We gather every boom stick
we can find

05:37.586 --> 05:42.176
- and start shooting photons at ...
- Ah, before you go any further...

05:44.938 --> 05:46.352
Matchy, matchy.
Cool.

05:48.735 --> 05:51.081
- Good night.
- Oh!

05:59.021 --> 06:03.370
Mooncake,
I wish we'd never met.

06:03.404 --> 06:07.201
Ooooh, chookity pok.

06:11.309 --> 06:15.209
He has nothing left.
You've drained him.

06:15.244 --> 06:19.178
- Time's up, wang dangler.
- No!

06:21.388 --> 06:24.943
I've killed you 100 different
ways in 100 different times,

06:24.978 --> 06:28.084
and every time,
Invictus always takes you.

06:28.119 --> 06:30.121
And the cycle begins again.

06:30.155 --> 06:32.261
But this time feels different.

06:32.295 --> 06:37.680
And when it takes you, tell it
we're coming to kill it.

06:37.715 --> 06:38.887
I...

06:50.141 --> 06:52.108
You finished causing trouble?

06:55.077 --> 06:59.149
Gary, may I speak in ironics?

06:59.150 --> 07:00.910
You're a prisoner once again.

07:00.945 --> 07:04.638
Wow. Freaking hilarious
insight, H.U.E.

07:04.673 --> 07:05.880
Now we gotta get out of here,

07:05.881 --> 07:08.711
and I think I have a plan.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.786
Oh, boy. Here we go!
Home free, boys!

07:14.821 --> 07:15.959
Home freeeee...

07:19.929 --> 07:21.724
- Okay.
- Not that bad.

07:21.759 --> 07:22.897
- Ready to go again?
- What?!

07:22.898 --> 07:23.967
I wouldn't do that, Gary.

07:25.452 --> 07:27.039
Ohh!

07:27.040 --> 07:30.146
- Okay, here we go.
- We got this.

07:30.181 --> 07:32.770
Ugh, I can't feel my head.

07:32.804 --> 07:35.289
We got close that time.

07:41.917 --> 07:44.195
Good news.
Something's come up.

07:44.229 --> 07:47.785
A little job which,
if you help the family with,

07:47.819 --> 07:51.098
you won't have to stay
imprisoned here for 20 years.

07:51.133 --> 07:53.894
I can feel the oil
rushing to my head.

07:53.929 --> 07:55.689
Okay. I'm listening.

07:55.724 --> 07:58.036
We're stealing
the Nymerian Cube.

07:58.071 --> 08:00.107
Where's this, uh, Hungarian Lube?
Where's that?

08:00.142 --> 08:03.248
On a ship that's entered
in the Toro Regatta

08:03.283 --> 08:07.390
the most spectacular space race
in all the galaxy.

08:07.425 --> 08:08.839
Gimme this race right now!

08:08.840 --> 08:11.912
Ordinarily, it's too
well-guarded to steal,

08:11.947 --> 08:14.328
which is why we're going
to pull this heist

08:14.363 --> 08:16.063
in the middle of the race.

08:16.089 --> 08:18.919
You've done time, so this
should be second nature.

08:18.954 --> 08:22.060
I'll even sweeten the deal
and throw in...

08:22.095 --> 08:23.795
The Crimson Light.

08:23.821 --> 08:26.478
A dietetic but
delicious-sounding soft drink?

08:26.513 --> 08:31.929
- A VX-9 light runner.
- Ooh!

08:33.037 --> 08:36.212
Envied by all.

08:39.111 --> 08:40.111
We get to go free?

08:40.113 --> 08:40.975
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:40.976 --> 08:42.390
And we get a spaceship?

08:42.390 --> 08:43.424
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.426 --> 08:46.395
All right.
You got yourself a dealio, yo.

08:46.429 --> 08:49.847
<i>Put. Them. Down.</i>

08:51.408 --> 08:54.100
Wha...

08:54.135 --> 08:56.240
Oh.

08:56.275 --> 08:58.829
No.

08:58.864 --> 09:00.174
Oh, no.

09:00.175 --> 09:01.866
For a second there,
I-I thought it was ...

09:01.867 --> 09:04.179
- I'm baaaaaack.
- No!

09:04.214 --> 09:05.455
I saw you die!

09:05.456 --> 09:07.700
It was so beautiful.
Go back!

09:07.735 --> 09:11.739
I can't go back.
I sensed that you're in danger.

09:11.773 --> 09:13.360
Do you ever sense
that I'min danger?

09:13.361 --> 09:16.558
- I don't really think about you.
- Mnh-mnh-mnh.

09:16.593 --> 09:18.124
- Mnh. Mnh-mnh-mnh.
- That's why I put myself back together.

09:18.159 --> 09:20.196
- No.
- I couldn't leave this world knowing my

09:20.226 --> 09:22.438
- best friend was out there, somewhere...
- No. No.

09:22.439 --> 09:24.406
...forever searching for me.

09:24.441 --> 09:26.141
- There was no searching.
- Right.

09:26.167 --> 09:28.859
- Because I was always in your heart.
- Mnh-mnh.

09:28.894 --> 09:31.413
- Equidistant from both nips, right here.
- Oh!

09:31.448 --> 09:35.003
Now let's play
who missed who the most.

09:37.799 --> 09:39.939
Sounds manageable.
We fly the ship.

09:39.974 --> 09:42.010
We get our freedom.
We get the hell out of here.

09:42.045 --> 09:43.355
Then we find Mooncake.

09:43.356 --> 09:45.427
It doesn't, like, sound too good
to be true or anything, right?

09:45.462 --> 09:49.017
Little Cato, sometimes,
if you're lucky,

09:49.052 --> 09:51.433
life takes the crap in your hand

09:51.468 --> 09:53.297
and hands you two slices of bread,

09:53.332 --> 09:56.093
and turns that crap
into a crap luck sandwich.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.818
You know,
but the crap sandwich is,

09:57.819 --> 10:02.098
- you know, still made out of crap.
- Yeah.

10:02.099 --> 10:04.688
But there's a little bit of luck
in there, too.

10:04.723 --> 10:06.068
And we're going to need it.

10:06.069 --> 10:08.830
Why is Clarence so obsessed
with this cube, anyway?

10:08.865 --> 10:11.764
<i>The Nymerian Cube is
a collapsed star small enough</i>

10:11.799 --> 10:14.456
<i>to hold in your hand
and extremely powerful.</i>

10:14.491 --> 10:15.802
What?
Who is this?

10:15.803 --> 10:18.322
<i>I'm AVA, the ship's AI.</i>

10:18.357 --> 10:20.324
AVA.
I like that name.

10:20.359 --> 10:22.775
I'm H.U.E.
I am also an AI.

10:22.810 --> 10:25.053
<i>Aww. Sure you are.</i>

10:25.088 --> 10:26.122
<i>Any more questions?</i>

10:26.123 --> 10:28.332
I didn't even have that question.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.783
<i>- Right.
- I like her.</i>

10:30.818 --> 10:35.408
<i>Get ready for
race day at the Toro Regatta!</i>

10:35.443 --> 10:37.099
The speed of our competitors

10:37.100 --> 10:41.000
is only outstripped
by their mad lust for victory.

10:41.035 --> 10:43.106
The Nymerian Cube
is on the Starchaser

10:43.140 --> 10:44.814
piloted by Rug Yorkvain,

10:44.815 --> 10:46.488
formerly Chag Murfblick,

10:46.523 --> 10:49.215
formerly Crix Blangdag,

11:04.403 --> 11:07.129
<i>Everyone's been

11:07.130 --> 11:08.544
<i>except for the crew

11:08.545 --> 11:10.028
<i>who just kinda showed up.</i>

11:10.029 --> 11:12.100
<i>The ragtag crew
of the Crimson Light</i>

11:12.135 --> 11:13.835
<i>does not look impressive!</i>

11:13.861 --> 11:15.828
<i>Krakorian oddsmakers
have them all dead</i>

11:15.863 --> 11:18.187
<i>by the end of the first heat!</i>

11:19.280 --> 11:23.560
<i>Welcome to the Toro Regatta!</i>

11:23.594 --> 11:29.117
<i>Racers, spool your engines.</i>

11:29.152 --> 11:31.793
<i>And here we go.</i>

11:32.327 --> 11:38.264
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

11:38.299 --> 11:40.703
<i>one...</i>

11:42.096 --> 11:45.271
<i>The Toro Regatta!
Sponsored by Dart Juice!</i>

11:45.306 --> 11:48.067
<i>Before you disintegrate
in a vain attempt at glory,</i>

11:48.102 --> 11:50.345
<i>taste the freshness of Dart Juice!</i>

11:50.380 --> 11:53.269
<i>I'm chuggin' one right now!</i>

11:53.590 --> 11:55.868
<i>The Crimson Light bringing up the rear.</i>

11:55.903 --> 11:57.939
<i>Wait a second.
It looks ... yes!</i>

11:57.974 --> 12:00.183
<i>It looks like the Crimson Light
is gaining ground.</i>

12:00.217 --> 12:03.565
<i>Pilot Gary Goodspeed
has burned past Dread Renegade,</i>

12:03.600 --> 12:06.409
<i>but something tells me
this won't last long.</i>

12:06.444 --> 12:08.467
<i>Warning ...
weapons are locked to our ship.</i>

12:08.501 --> 12:11.952
- What kind of race is this, Clarence?
- A race to the death.

12:11.953 --> 12:14.059
- Didn't I mention that?
- No, you didn't!

12:15.060 --> 12:16.336
They got us!

12:16.337 --> 12:17.958
They're trying to rip out
our lightfold engine!

12:17.959 --> 12:19.961
We're gonna get 'em.
We're gonna get 'em!

12:19.996 --> 12:21.237
Does this help, Gary?

12:21.238 --> 12:22.929
- No!
- Tropical Muzak engaged.

12:22.930 --> 12:24.828
All right, well, a little.
Actually, it's kinda catchy.

12:24.863 --> 12:25.932
- Dit dit dit dit...
- Gary!

12:25.933 --> 12:27.347
- Oh, oh.
- Gary.

12:27.348 --> 12:29.207
- I see it.
- Gary!

12:29.242 --> 12:30.454
I see it!

12:30.489 --> 12:32.042
<i>Whoa!
It's the ol' twist and burn</i>

12:32.077 --> 12:34.838
<i>as they release a baker's
dozen photon missiles</i>

12:34.873 --> 12:37.185
<i>ready to cook the Crimson Light!</i>

12:37.220 --> 12:42.915
<i>Ooh! And the Dread Renegade
goes down!</i>

12:42.950 --> 12:47.195
Catch the Starchaser.
It's time we make our move.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.611
<i>With just three ships left,
it's anyone's race.</i>

12:49.646 --> 12:52.062
<i>The Starchaser regains the lead!</i>

12:52.097 --> 12:55.134
<i>There they go, past Bee-tor,
the sacred beetle king!</i>

12:55.169 --> 12:57.343
<i>Oh, no!</i>

12:58.689 --> 13:00.380
All right. Go, go, go, go.
Get the cube. Get the ...

13:00.381 --> 13:02.081
Who's ... Who's getting the cube
from the Starchaser?

13:02.107 --> 13:03.521
You are.

13:03.522 --> 13:05.248
You don't think I'm going to
risk my life and my children's

13:05.282 --> 13:08.941
when I have
disposable you here, do you?

13:08.976 --> 13:11.150
- What?
- Back off, Ventrexian!

13:11.185 --> 13:13.635
Unless you want another
thousand-year war!

13:13.670 --> 13:16.224
You back off, Tryvuulian.

13:16.259 --> 13:19.227
No, youback off, Ventrexian!

13:19.262 --> 13:22.208
Don't hurt him!
I kind of like him!

13:22.472 --> 13:24.162
I mean, what?

13:24.163 --> 13:25.715
<i>Incoming.</i>

13:25.716 --> 13:29.272
<i>Dirty play!
But we like that!</i>

13:30.445 --> 13:33.241
We're going to need cover
from those nasty lasers.

13:33.276 --> 13:37.659
- Get out there and destroy things.
- Before I take a life...

13:37.694 --> 13:40.524
I make a life.

13:40.559 --> 13:43.527
Whoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

13:43.562 --> 13:45.045
Why do this?

13:45.046 --> 13:48.981
Ohh! Oh, I can see body parts
and everything.

13:49.016 --> 13:52.053
Oh, no!
I can't do this anymore!

13:52.088 --> 13:55.574
The hell you can't!
This is how we wreck it, Tryvuulian!

13:57.024 --> 14:00.130
<i>Oh, that's "regatta" hurt!</i>

14:00.165 --> 14:01.865
Aaah!

14:02.753 --> 14:05.273
Keep moving, primate.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.310
<i>Starchaser's drop driving!</i>

14:07.344 --> 14:08.724
What the hell was that?

14:08.725 --> 14:10.692
- AVA?
- Yes, gorgeous?

14:10.727 --> 14:13.005
Engage the drop drive, Lambchop.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.897
- Wait. What is a drop drive?
- Engaging drop.

14:14.932 --> 14:17.147
Was it that thing? Because I
don't want to do it if it's that.

14:17.182 --> 14:18.527
- No, no, no, no! I don't want to do it!
- 3, 2, 1.

14:18.528 --> 14:19.597
Oh, no. No, no, no.

14:19.598 --> 14:21.703
Oh! Oh, no!

14:28.089 --> 14:29.745
<i>Drop drive initiated.</i>

14:29.746 --> 14:33.163
<i>Now traveling through
dimensional space.</i>

14:34.337 --> 14:38.329
Gary, can you feel it?
The Nymerian Cube's right there.

14:38.364 --> 14:39.134
Oh, my God.

14:39.135 --> 14:41.447
There is a little tadpole
digglin' out of your pants.

14:41.482 --> 14:43.587
- What is that?!
- My Money Compass.

14:43.622 --> 14:46.452
It points me in the direction of money.

14:46.487 --> 14:48.915
Eh. Kiss.
Hmm?

14:48.950 --> 14:52.320
Ash, attach a jump cable
to the primate.

14:52.355 --> 14:53.700
Oh, man.
What am I doing here?

14:53.701 --> 14:58.533
I ... I lost a frigging planet.
I am not the guy for this.

14:58.568 --> 15:00.535
Let's go already!

15:00.570 --> 15:03.504
Oh, you kicked me!
Oh, this is not good!

15:03.538 --> 15:06.343
Oh! The cable!
No! I'm falling!

15:06.369 --> 15:08.474
- Gary?
- Someone save me!

15:08.509 --> 15:11.201
Hold on!

15:13.100 --> 15:14.134
Oh.

15:15.792 --> 15:19.140
Ash, how are you doing
that thingy thing?

15:19.175 --> 15:21.004
Awh!

15:21.039 --> 15:22.764
What?!

15:22.799 --> 15:24.282
Oh, no!

15:29.392 --> 15:32.360
Oh!
Ohh. Oh.

15:32.395 --> 15:34.224
Finger painting.

15:34.259 --> 15:36.640
Who's got goggles
with a little moustache?

15:36.675 --> 15:40.506
- You do.
- Ha ha. Looking for this?

15:40.541 --> 15:42.715
The Librarian Cube.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.786
Ta-ta.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.515
- What is he doing?
- Aw, crap.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.793
They're destroying their own ship!

15:56.591 --> 15:58.662
Oh, no. That means
they're gonna hijack ours.

15:58.697 --> 16:00.397
We got to get back!
Do ... Do your thingy!

16:00.423 --> 16:01.837
- Do the thingy!
- What thingy?

16:01.838 --> 16:03.598
The thingy thing! The ...
The ... Activate the thingy!

16:03.633 --> 16:06.670
What? Well, I can't just ...
I can't just pop it on, man!

16:06.705 --> 16:10.294
Okay, last chance to activate
the thingy thing! No?!

16:10.295 --> 16:11.502
Then ... Then j-jump!

16:14.644 --> 16:19.545
You liar!
We could have gently levitated!

16:19.580 --> 16:20.649
Oh, my.

16:23.722 --> 16:25.689
Oh, hello, top of the ship again.

16:25.724 --> 16:28.347
Where's generic blond guy?

16:28.382 --> 16:30.867
You're a liar!

16:32.593 --> 16:37.149
- A stinking liar!
- He sounds mad.

16:37.184 --> 16:38.770
Whoah!

16:38.771 --> 16:41.084
Give me the cube, you
handsome, handsome man!

16:41.809 --> 16:43.499
All right.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.365
I... can... head... butt...

16:46.400 --> 16:49.437
you... all... day.

16:49.472 --> 16:50.506
Ohh!

16:50.507 --> 16:52.854
Uh-oh! Oh.
No, I can't.

16:52.889 --> 16:55.374
Oh. Oh, no.
Oh, no.

16:55.409 --> 16:57.376
Oh, no!

17:02.278 --> 17:03.347
How ... oh, my.

17:03.348 --> 17:04.486
Ho! Oh!

17:04.487 --> 17:06.489
How are you still so handsome?!

17:08.628 --> 17:12.589
- Look who's still got it.
- No, actually, I do.

17:12.625 --> 17:16.326
AVA, disengage drop drive,
my little gumdrop.

17:17.362 --> 17:18.810
<i>You got it, big boy.</i>

17:18.810 --> 17:20.511
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

17:20.537 --> 17:23.333
<i>The Crimson Light's back in the race!</i>

17:23.367 --> 17:25.127
<i>But they're not alone.</i>

17:25.163 --> 17:27.474
<i>The Invader Red
is closing in on us.</i>

17:27.510 --> 17:29.822
<i>Oh, and we're about
to be disintegrated.</i>

17:29.857 --> 17:31.617
She's right, Gary.
We got trouble.

17:31.652 --> 17:32.790
Shield! Uh, uh!

17:32.791 --> 17:36.346
Fire something!
Press buttons!

17:36.381 --> 17:37.795
<i>Red has been neutralized</i>

17:37.796 --> 17:41.351
<i>- by an unidentified ship, Gary.
- Yes!</i>

17:41.386 --> 17:42.455
Chookity!

17:42.456 --> 17:46.632
<i>Regatta, baby!
Ya gotta, Regatta!</i>

17:46.667 --> 17:51.361
<i>And the Crimson Light wins
the Toro Regatta!</i>

17:59.576 --> 18:01.440
- Mooncake?
- Gar?

18:01.475 --> 18:03.752
- Mooncake!
- Gar, Gar, Gar, Gar, Gar! Gar.

18:03.753 --> 18:04.960
- Oh.
- Chookity...

18:04.961 --> 18:05.995
- What?
- ...pok pok pok pok pok.

18:05.996 --> 18:07.445
- Oh.
- Chookity! Chookity pok!

18:07.446 --> 18:09.044
Pok pok! Chooka pooka!

18:09.079 --> 18:09.827

- Anda Chookity

18:09.828 --> 18:11.277

- Oh, geez. Oh, God. Okay.

18:11.278 --> 18:12.761
- Yeah?
- Chookity pok pok pok.

18:12.762 --> 18:14.211
- Chooka pok.
- You lost your powers?

18:14.212 --> 18:15.557
And then, the ... then ...
And then, what happened?

18:15.558 --> 18:16.972
- Pok.
- Oh, oh. You were done.

18:16.973 --> 18:19.389
Okay, well.

18:22.012 --> 18:25.912
- Nightfall. You're alive?
- And you're alive.

18:25.913 --> 18:28.674
Let's assume everyone
who is here is ... is alive.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.573
I have a body now, everybody.

18:30.607 --> 18:33.955
What I mean to say is,
if you're alive,

18:33.990 --> 18:36.268
Quinn is alive, too, right?

18:36.303 --> 18:41.273
Gary, no one has ever
returned from Final Space.

18:41.308 --> 18:44.549
That just means there's
got to be a first time.

18:51.663 --> 18:56.633
<i>Our work isn't done, child.</i>

18:56.668 --> 19:01.190
<i>It's only just... begun.</i>

19:04.745 --> 19:07.730
Gary, the Crimson Light
is going to need

19:07.731 --> 19:10.716
- extensive repairs to ...
- The airlocks, lightfold engines,

19:10.751 --> 19:12.451
<i>and captain's bath house.</i>

19:12.477 --> 19:14.306
I was going to say that, AVA.

19:14.341 --> 19:16.239
<i>Yeah, but cha didn't.</i>

19:16.274 --> 19:18.586
Isn't AVA the best?

19:18.621 --> 19:20.450
Right, H.U.E.?
Did you hear me?

19:20.485 --> 19:22.332
H.U.E.? H.U.E.?

19:22.367 --> 19:24.005
- Have I really sunk this low?
- H.U.E.? H.U.E.?

19:24.040 --> 19:28.383
You sure have.
Ooh.

19:29.045 --> 19:30.805
Smell it up, Clarence.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.876
It's the glorious scent called Freedom.

19:32.911 --> 19:36.742
Ahh. What you're smelling is
that you're still my property,

19:36.777 --> 19:40.055
- and I'm keeping the ship.
- Say what? What?

19:40.056 --> 19:42.679
My guess is that you
didn't read the fine print.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.474
What fine print?
There was no fine print.

19:44.509 --> 19:46.069
You gave me your word!

19:46.135 --> 19:48.927
My word isthe fine print,
Dingus, and I just changed it.

19:48.961 --> 19:50.376
If you need me...

19:56.106 --> 19:57.383
Bolo?

19:57.384 --> 20:00.490
<i>Gary. Days are coming.</i>

20:00.525 --> 20:02.975
<i>The war for your universe
has begun.</i>

20:03.010 --> 20:05.909
<i>The time has come
for you to free me.</i>

20:05.944 --> 20:11.052
<i>Otherwise, no one ...
past, present, or future ...</i>

20:11.087 --> 20:12.743
<i>will survive.</i>

20:12.744 --> 20:14.815
Yeah...
Yeah, no, I'm good.

20:14.849 --> 20:17.680
<i>Everything depends on all of you.</i>

20:17.714 --> 20:21.545
<i>- Our journey leads to Final Space.
- Wait, to Quinn?</i>

20:21.546 --> 20:25.480
<i>- Together, we can save her.
- How?</i>

20:25.481 --> 20:28.587
<i>Gather the five Dimensional Keys.</i>

20:28.622 --> 20:30.555
<i>With them, you'll have the power</i>

20:30.589 --> 20:32.107
<i>to break through my prison.</i>

20:32.108 --> 20:33.764
Okay, that's great and all,
but where do I ...

20:33.765 --> 20:35.041
where do I get 'em?

20:35.042 --> 20:37.872
<i>They are hidden across your universe,</i>

20:37.907 --> 20:42.601
<i>but you are already
in possession of the first one.</i>

20:42.636 --> 20:44.119
<i>Peace out, Gary.</i>

20:48.020 --> 20:53.440
Yo!
Yo, B-Bolo, dude!

20:53.474 --> 20:55.407
The universe is a really big place.

21:01.586 --> 21:03.034
<i>Engines spooled.</i>

21:03.035 --> 21:06.453
I'm going to break a Titan
out of inter-dimensional prison.

21:06.487 --> 21:08.489
- Sticking around?
- Wouldn't miss it.

21:08.524 --> 21:12.113
- Out of my seat, primate.
- Yo. My ship, my seat.

21:12.148 --> 21:14.426
Then you leave me no choice.

21:14.461 --> 21:17.789
- Ow.
- Clarence, why is there a pack of Smartees ...

21:17.866 --> 21:20.880
- Oh! Oh, Clarence!
- It's still my Money Compass.

21:20.881 --> 21:22.779
I'm just excited
to be at the controls.

21:22.814 --> 21:25.437
- Grabbing life by its succulent ...
- Oh, Clarence!

21:25.472 --> 21:27.461
Will you get the hell off me?!
