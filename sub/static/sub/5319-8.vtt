00:03.950 --> 00:05.700
Easy to load. Never jams.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.370
Basically point and shoot.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.440
Nice thing about the .38, it
doesn't have too much of a kick.

00:09.490 --> 00:11.210
But don't worry.

00:11.260 --> 00:14.440
Aim it right, it'll get the job done.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.020
Fuck. Fuck.

00:21.070 --> 00:22.690
I don't understand.

00:22.740 --> 00:25.560
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.560
Hey.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.160
Fuck!

00:29.210 --> 00:31.790
You told me. You said he was "they."

00:31.840 --> 00:34.800
You said God told you.

00:34.850 --> 00:36.830
I tried to call you, man.

00:36.880 --> 00:39.000
You told me to turn off my phone.

00:39.050 --> 00:40.870
You told me not to communicate.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.340
I know, I know. I... I...

00:42.390 --> 00:44.340
Fuck!

00:44.390 --> 00:47.410
Is this innocent blood on my hands?

00:47.460 --> 00:48.460
Is it?

00:50.700 --> 00:54.650
Get the fuck away from me!

00:54.700 --> 00:57.890
I tried to call you.

00:57.940 --> 00:59.590
You stay the fuck away from me.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.560
I tried to call you.

01:01.610 --> 01:05.800
I tried to call you. I
tried to call you, man.

01:38.780 --> 01:40.600
Josh.

01:43.420 --> 01:45.140
Josh.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.290
Hey, where are you?

02:06.340 --> 02:09.330
You're not going to
believe what I did tonight.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.530
And now I'm hungry for some Top Dog.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.360
So if you want one, you
just got to call me, okay?

02:14.410 --> 02:16.670
Because the window is closing.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.070
And, um, oh, I turned in the note,

02:20.120 --> 02:22.470
and the court date is still on.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.170
So...

02:25.020 --> 02:27.580
Okay, um,

02:27.630 --> 02:30.510
yeah, bye.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.920
There's a courtroom full of people

04:17.970 --> 04:19.860
waiting for you, Pernell,

04:19.910 --> 04:23.390
including one pissed-off me.

04:28.150 --> 04:30.730
Pernell, we got to get started.

04:33.890 --> 04:35.940
You don't...

04:35.990 --> 04:39.540
see any doves, do you?

04:45.600 --> 04:46.920
Like birds?

05:00.450 --> 05:02.630
I think I'm gonna need a ride.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.110
No, no, no, no, no.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.110
No phone.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.150
How about round three?

05:19.200 --> 05:23.250
Jesus, are you sure?

05:23.300 --> 05:25.720
You barely made it through round two.

05:25.770 --> 05:28.390
Well, feels like round three.

05:30.810 --> 05:32.930
I'll say.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.110
Is that Pernell again?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.910
No, it's Randy.

05:44.960 --> 05:45.910
Don't fall for it.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.310
She's just his beard.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.110
No, you call her back, he'll answer.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.450
Oh, shit.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.960
I got to go.

06:01.010 --> 06:03.130
What?

06:03.180 --> 06:07.060
What could Randy have possibly
said to make you leave?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.440
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

06:13.490 --> 06:16.310
10% Day is now in the Renaissance era.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.410
Renaissance. Renaissance era.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.610
- You heard?
- Randy called me.

06:22.660 --> 06:24.150
A week ago he wouldn't take his medicine.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.450
Now he's checking himself
into the crazy house.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.450
What the fuck happened?

06:26.500 --> 06:28.120
I don't know, Bobo.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.520
I haven't been home since I
heard about his recent nuptials.

06:31.570 --> 06:34.320
You left him, now?

06:34.370 --> 06:36.590
I needed space.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.490
And you couldn't move into
one of the other six bedrooms

06:38.540 --> 06:40.000
in the mansion?

06:40.050 --> 06:41.400
You need to go talk to him.

06:41.450 --> 06:43.430
Get him out of there
before people find out.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.230
I'm running a city.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.400
I'm giving a speech at the
Kiwanis Club in two hours.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.740
Can't just drop everything

06:48.790 --> 06:50.110
and look at ink blots with Pernell.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.940
Not gonna be me, Bobo.

06:51.990 --> 06:55.850
I have done everything I could
to keep him in the stable.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.080
I'm out.

06:57.130 --> 06:58.480
Everything but stay home.

06:58.530 --> 07:00.920
- Oh, low blow.
- Okay, okay.

07:00.970 --> 07:03.850
I'm just saying, we've all taken
plenty of hits for the team.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.790
I feel like the fucking first
wave on the beaches at Normandy.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.020
Maybe we leave him in there.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.900
No.

07:14.950 --> 07:18.570
No, not when I'm getting my
concrete pour in a few days.

07:18.620 --> 07:21.540
Maybe when the Brooks deal
is actually set in stone,

07:21.590 --> 07:23.070
then Pernell can go ahead

07:23.120 --> 07:25.840
and play Old MacDonald
at the fucking funny farm,

07:25.890 --> 07:27.240
but right now,

07:27.290 --> 07:29.750
all the work that you and
I have done is at risk.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.520
This is... this is just one
more hurdle we have to get over.

07:32.570 --> 07:34.920
You... you've got to talk to him.

07:34.970 --> 07:37.750
Bobo, I am telling you,

07:37.800 --> 07:40.220
if I see him,

07:40.270 --> 07:42.530
it's gonna make things worse.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.000
Okay, okay.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.700
Okay, it's gonna have to be tomorrow,

07:48.750 --> 07:51.770
but I'll take care of it.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.200
Where's he staying at, again?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.710
Serenity Lake.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.640
Maybe when you get there,
you can talk to somebody

07:57.690 --> 07:59.610
about your blood pressure.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.090
I thought there'd be a nice view.

08:16.140 --> 08:19.290
Like at Passages?

08:19.340 --> 08:21.160
That's bullshit.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.530
You're out on some bluff.
You're looking out at the ocean.

08:23.580 --> 08:26.000
You're thinking, "Things
can't be that bad."

08:26.050 --> 08:27.600
Well, fuck that.

08:27.650 --> 08:30.440
Things are that bad, and
that's why you're here.

08:30.490 --> 08:32.909
You want a vacation, you go to Passages.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.140
You want to work, you come here.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.919
I'm here.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.750
I know.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.790
So what do you want?

08:45.970 --> 08:49.220
I've been...

08:49.270 --> 08:51.090
having hallucinations.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.600
So you said at intake.

08:52.650 --> 08:55.230
You've been hearing voices too.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.130
But what do you want?

08:57.180 --> 08:59.370
Or did you just come here
to get that off your chest?

08:59.420 --> 09:02.270
I want them gone.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.540
There's an answer.

09:04.590 --> 09:06.710
Next question.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.210
What's causing them?

09:09.260 --> 09:11.910
- I don't know.
- Bullshit.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.250
- Excuse me?
- You're full of shit.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.120
It's not schizophrenia.

09:16.170 --> 09:17.890
That shit doesn't kick
in for the first time

09:17.940 --> 09:20.190
when you're old enough to be a grandpa.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.930
Something happened,

09:22.980 --> 09:25.500
and I know you didn't just
ship in from Afghanistan,

09:25.550 --> 09:28.230
so what the fuck?

09:28.280 --> 09:30.570
I don't appreciate the
tone you're taking with me.

09:30.620 --> 09:32.640
Well, then take a swing.

09:35.590 --> 09:38.370
I'm kidding. I don't want to fight.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.210
And I also don't want to
waste your time either.

09:41.260 --> 09:44.610
Most places will dose you with
pills they don't understand

09:44.660 --> 09:47.120
or let you cry on a couch for a decade.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.820
I don't go that way.

09:48.870 --> 09:52.820
If you don't want real talk, then walk.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.700
I thought it was God sending me messages.

10:02.820 --> 10:04.300
So for the last few months,

10:04.350 --> 10:06.870
you thought you were talking to the Divine.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.970
And now?

10:13.790 --> 10:17.150
I just... think I'm crazy.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.320
What changed?

10:25.140 --> 10:26.690
My client's already
answered these questions.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.590
It's okay. Whatever it takes to find Josh.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.890
I called him a hundred times.

10:31.940 --> 10:34.260
I called all of his friends,
and nobody's heard from him.

10:34.310 --> 10:36.700
And how long have you two
been seeing each other?

10:36.750 --> 10:38.370
We're not seeing each other.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.640
I moved with him because I
didn't want to stay in my house.

10:40.690 --> 10:42.970
But if he did go away for some reason,

10:43.020 --> 10:44.510
you'd expect him to be in touch.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.680
Absolutely.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.210
This is not like him.

10:47.260 --> 10:48.310
People can surprise you.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.010
We had this guy go missing for three days.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.780
He had a wife and three kids.

10:52.830 --> 10:54.120
Turns out he drove to Denver

10:54.170 --> 10:55.650
because the Broncos made the Super Bowl,

10:55.700 --> 10:57.650
and he had to stand in line for tickets.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.890
Phone died. Didn't want to get out of line.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.660
You think she's overreacting?

11:01.710 --> 11:04.660
I'm not overreacting.
Something's not right.

11:04.710 --> 11:06.070
I think it's also worth mentioning

11:06.110 --> 11:07.750
that one of the last people Josh was with

11:07.780 --> 11:10.300
before she lost contact
with him was Pernell Harris.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.200
Is that right?

11:15.250 --> 11:18.270
Yeah, Josh texted me that he was there,

11:18.320 --> 11:20.520
but I don't know that that
had anything to do with this.

11:20.530 --> 11:21.680
But we do know the only way Pernell

11:21.730 --> 11:23.750
keeps his son on life support

11:23.800 --> 11:25.950
is if Josh Miller doesn't testify in court.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.390
You think Judge Harris paid
Josh to disappear for a while?

11:31.440 --> 11:32.620
Maybe.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.090
But because of that connection,

11:34.140 --> 11:36.360
we should make this a
priority, don't you think?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.960
So we don't even know Mr. Miller's missing.

11:41.010 --> 11:44.200
He's got his car, his
car keys, and his phone.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.770
When people go missing,
the first thing we look for

11:45.820 --> 11:47.500
is something they'd never leave behind.

11:47.550 --> 11:49.470
I'm here.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.440
He wouldn't just disappear
without telling me.

12:13.110 --> 12:14.110
Ah.

13:33.490 --> 13:34.980
I'm not angry with you.

13:35.030 --> 13:37.050
I was gonna tell you.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.280
You were just trying
to find the right time.

13:43.140 --> 13:46.360
Maybe there isn't a right time.

13:48.310 --> 13:51.630
It still would have been
good to hear it from you.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.860
I know.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.300
I'm sorry.

13:59.950 --> 14:02.270
I guess you have a decision to make.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.340
We.

14:11.130 --> 14:13.950
It's your body, Alicia.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.350
But it's our baby.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.800
The procedure went as planned,

14:32.850 --> 14:34.200
but I don't want to get your hopes up.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.940
There's been a lot of cranial damage,

14:35.990 --> 14:38.940
but we'll know more once
the swelling goes down.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.910
Thank you.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.410
What did the doctor say?

14:45.460 --> 14:49.150
They had to operate to relieve
the swelling in his brain.

14:54.940 --> 14:57.590
How are you holding up?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.630
Oh.

15:00.950 --> 15:04.170
It's okay. It's okay.

15:05.550 --> 15:09.170
Hey, we're a family,

15:09.220 --> 15:12.980
and we're gonna get
through this like a family,

15:13.030 --> 15:16.210
and we're gonna be by PJ's
side until he wakes up.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.890
Do you want to go see him now?

15:22.940 --> 15:24.020
No, it's okay.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.260
You go. He needs you.

15:26.310 --> 15:30.430
I'll stay here with his mother.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.330
Oh.

15:38.650 --> 15:40.670
You should go in there.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.440
One of the nurses said that

15:42.490 --> 15:43.870
patients recover faster

15:43.920 --> 15:44.870
if the family spends time with them.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.910
I'm not going in there.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.340
What?

15:49.390 --> 15:52.150
PJ doesn't want to recover.

15:56.570 --> 15:57.390
That's your son in there.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.190
My son shot himself in the head.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.090
He wants to die, so let him.

16:08.350 --> 16:11.900
So your son's
life hung in the balance,

16:11.950 --> 16:15.140
and you said, "Let him die."

16:15.190 --> 16:17.070
How long did it take you
to regret saying that?

16:17.120 --> 16:20.010
The minute it came out of my mouth.

16:21.790 --> 16:22.740
I didn't mean it.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.180
You didn't mean it?

16:24.230 --> 16:27.720
Or you didn't mean to say it?

16:27.770 --> 16:29.450
I was angry.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.790
Hey, I get it.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.360
If someone had shot PJ in the head,

16:33.410 --> 16:36.060
you would hate that fuck
for the rest of your life.

16:36.110 --> 16:39.690
Unfortunately, in this case,
that fuck happened to be PJ.

16:39.740 --> 16:42.100
No.

16:42.150 --> 16:43.670
I was angry at the world.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.940
I just...

16:45.990 --> 16:48.240
I just took it out on PJ.

16:49.990 --> 16:51.770
Okay, let's go back.

16:51.820 --> 16:54.340
Anger is a by-product of fear.

16:54.390 --> 16:56.650
What were you afraid of?

16:59.760 --> 17:01.020
Losing PJ, I guess.

17:01.070 --> 17:03.450
You guess? That's it?

17:03.500 --> 17:06.089
He's my son. Isn't that enough?

17:06.140 --> 17:07.520
Not even close.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.260
A lot of people lose loved
ones, even their kids.

17:09.310 --> 17:11.630
They don't wind up swimming in a fountain

17:11.680 --> 17:14.099
convinced they have God on speed dial.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.740
But this is a good start.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.440
You want these hallucinations to go away,

17:26.490 --> 17:29.210
you need to figure out
what you're afraid of.

17:34.530 --> 17:35.820
Where's my coffee?

17:35.870 --> 17:38.450
It's in the café. The
line was long as hell.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.520
You mean you didn't go in time.

17:40.570 --> 17:41.760
You got something you want to say?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.360
- No, sir.
- You sure?

17:43.410 --> 17:44.360
Yes, Daddy.

17:44.410 --> 17:45.560
I'm not gonna let that go.

17:45.610 --> 17:47.000
I'm tired of having to explain...

17:47.050 --> 17:48.560
Mr. Mayor, do you have a minute?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.400
For you, two minutes.

17:50.450 --> 17:53.000
You seem a little stressed.
Is everything okay?

17:53.050 --> 17:55.040
Just hosing down the normal brush fires.

17:55.090 --> 17:56.440
Well, this might brighten your day.

17:56.490 --> 17:58.270
We just got confirmation that Mr. Brooks

17:58.320 --> 18:00.410
will here next week for the concrete pour,

18:00.460 --> 18:03.010
and he might even make the
party at the Harris estate.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.650
Are you teasing me, Miss Wu?

18:04.700 --> 18:07.120
Because that's mayoral
abuse, which is a misdemeanor.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.720
And if it isn't, I'll make it one.

18:08.770 --> 18:11.420
I'm looking at his
travel itinerary right here.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.090
I could have emailed that to you,

18:13.140 --> 18:14.320
but Mr. Brooks wants to talk

18:14.370 --> 18:16.160
to Judge Harris before he arrives.

18:16.210 --> 18:17.260
We've been calling, but we haven't

18:17.310 --> 18:18.530
been able to get hold of him.

18:18.580 --> 18:19.830
I'll make sure Pernell calls him.

18:19.880 --> 18:21.860
- Thank you.
- Could you...

18:21.910 --> 18:23.870
Could you call him right now?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.030
Right this second?

18:25.080 --> 18:26.600
I know he's very busy,

18:26.650 --> 18:29.040
but things like this make Mr. Brooks worry,

18:29.090 --> 18:32.570
so if you could make it a priority...

18:32.620 --> 18:35.040
I'm working against a bit of
a deadline right this second,

18:35.090 --> 18:37.780
but I'll have him call
him, put Mr. Brooks at ease.

18:37.830 --> 18:39.280
Good, because I would love

18:39.330 --> 18:41.480
to spend the next few days
deciding what dress to wear

18:41.530 --> 18:43.250
and not wondering if this deal

18:43.300 --> 18:47.160
is going to turn into
a pumpkin at midnight.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.060
Got the message.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.630
Thank you.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.160
Felony.

18:53.210 --> 18:56.870
I'm gonna make it a fucking felony.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.170
So once you checked off

18:59.220 --> 19:01.600
all the things on God's to-do list

19:01.650 --> 19:04.510
and PJ woke up,

19:04.560 --> 19:05.940
then what was supposed to happen?

19:05.990 --> 19:08.080
What do you mean?

19:08.130 --> 19:09.540
Nothing.

19:09.590 --> 19:12.250
We just go back to our lives.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.850
Well, that sounds nice.

19:13.900 --> 19:17.320
What did you imagine the
two of you doing together

19:17.370 --> 19:20.160
once you got him back?

19:20.210 --> 19:23.390
Tell him how much I love him.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.600
I'd hold him in my arms
for as long as I could.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.500
Feel him hugging me back.

19:33.550 --> 19:34.940
Okay,

19:34.990 --> 19:37.810
but more than a few minutes
of that would be weird, right?

19:37.860 --> 19:39.570
So then what?

19:39.620 --> 19:43.110
What did you have planned for
after those first few minutes?

19:43.160 --> 19:45.510
I don't know. I don't know.

19:45.560 --> 19:49.980
Life would just go back to being normal.

19:50.030 --> 19:52.690
Tell me about normal.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.560
Hmm?

19:54.610 --> 19:57.790
What did you and PJ used to do together?

20:02.110 --> 20:03.800
Well...

20:05.620 --> 20:07.740
When he was eight,

20:07.790 --> 20:11.640
I got him these walkie-talkies
with a Morse code button,

20:11.690 --> 20:15.240
and we hung a sheet alongside the bunk bed,

20:15.290 --> 20:17.810
pretended it was a submarine.

20:17.860 --> 20:22.780
We used to send coded
messages to each other.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.190
When he was 11,

20:25.240 --> 20:27.990
he figured out how to boost the signal,

20:28.040 --> 20:29.920
have it go across the whole house.

20:29.970 --> 20:31.690
So when PJ woke up,

20:31.740 --> 20:34.730
you were gonna play submarines?

20:36.780 --> 20:40.270
I'm not saying that that's
what we were gonna...

20:40.320 --> 20:43.140
All I'm saying is that
we did do things together.

20:43.190 --> 20:44.510
That's when he was a kid,

20:44.560 --> 20:46.740
when he depended upon you for survival.

20:46.790 --> 20:49.780
Oh, trust me, he still
depends on me for survival.

20:49.830 --> 20:52.850
Who do you think's paying
for that house he lives in?

20:52.900 --> 20:55.180
So it's your fault, then,

20:55.230 --> 20:57.190
that PJ shot himself?

20:57.240 --> 20:58.320
What the hell did you just say?

20:58.370 --> 20:59.990
You just told me that PJ

21:00.040 --> 21:01.660
depended on you for survival.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.390
Sounds to me like you
fucked that up pretty good.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.060
Why don't you just get the
fuck to what you're getting at?

21:06.110 --> 21:08.500
No, the point of this
is to try to figure out

21:08.550 --> 21:10.770
what the fuck you are trying to get at

21:10.820 --> 21:13.770
and why you wanted to
have these hallucinations.

21:13.820 --> 21:14.870
Wanted?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.210
Who would want to be haunted like that?

21:17.260 --> 21:18.580
Every day is a fucking nightmare.

21:18.590 --> 21:21.440
And yet it took you two months

21:21.490 --> 21:23.510
of having these visions to come to me,

21:23.560 --> 21:26.220
two months before you'd even admit

21:26.270 --> 21:27.950
you might have a problem.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.490
That, my friend, is a
hell of a fucking problem.

21:37.710 --> 21:40.460
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

21:40.510 --> 21:42.500
Not for nothing, but this is the last place

21:42.550 --> 21:43.700
you should be, Pernell.

21:43.750 --> 21:44.900
That right?

21:44.950 --> 21:46.970
Is there a bar to go to when your son

21:47.020 --> 21:48.470
shoots himself in the head?

21:48.520 --> 21:49.570
Yes, as a matter of fact.

21:49.620 --> 21:51.140
It's called the hospital.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.070
Lots of lights and sirens.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.310
They got a DJ that plays
nothing but that Muzak.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.510
Waitresses wear Crocs instead of heels,

21:57.560 --> 22:01.280
but they bring you the good drugs.

22:01.330 --> 22:02.820
Any of this working?

22:07.870 --> 22:10.960
It's where your family is,
bro, where you need to be.

22:11.010 --> 22:12.630
They can all watch him die without me.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.930
I'm not turning this
into a Hallmark moment.

22:16.950 --> 22:18.500
This might be your last
chance to end things

22:18.550 --> 22:21.770
the right way with PJ,
tell him you love him,

22:21.820 --> 22:23.270
maybe tell him how much
you're proud of him...

22:23.320 --> 22:27.380
Stop fucking picking at me, Robert.

22:31.330 --> 22:33.520
Please go.

22:57.690 --> 22:59.840
You okay?

22:59.890 --> 23:02.410
Yeah, fine.

23:03.660 --> 23:05.750
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but notice.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.980
You look like you could use a friend.

23:13.370 --> 23:17.430
I'm not looking for a
friend. Not tonight, darling.

23:18.740 --> 23:22.000
I bet we'd have a lot in common.

23:22.050 --> 23:23.930
Is that right?

23:23.980 --> 23:26.670
I recognize something in your eyes,

23:26.720 --> 23:30.770
because I've seen that before in my own.

23:30.820 --> 23:32.970
You're sad.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.780
You're confused.

23:36.190 --> 23:38.450
You're looking for answers.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.420
I bet you got all the answers.

23:46.470 --> 23:50.360
No, not me.

23:50.410 --> 23:52.060
But...

23:52.110 --> 23:57.270
if you're looking for someone who does,

23:57.320 --> 23:59.730
then you should come.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.240
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:43.290 --> 24:46.280
Why don't you let KD do that?

24:46.330 --> 24:48.280
I haven't seen him in two days.

24:48.330 --> 24:50.820
I can't wait for him.

24:50.870 --> 24:52.850
Well, maybe I'll go check up on him later.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.690
Yeah.

24:57.510 --> 24:59.630
So what are your thoughts?

24:59.680 --> 25:03.060
I go back and forth. You?

25:03.110 --> 25:07.200
I can't think of anything else.

25:07.250 --> 25:09.700
Me either.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.610
I was thinking about the marina,

25:11.660 --> 25:15.010
how we used to park there
and talk about our dreams.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.080
We'd build this church,

25:16.130 --> 25:18.110
and when it was strong and thriving,

25:18.160 --> 25:19.610
we'd announce our love to the world.

25:19.660 --> 25:21.450
We'd have a fairy-tale wedding.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.590
First class everything.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.560
And then we would start a family.

25:38.220 --> 25:39.670
That can still happen.

25:52.130 --> 25:55.050
Now we need to choose between our dreams.

25:55.100 --> 25:58.890
A preacher fathers a baby with
a young woman in his flock...

26:00.070 --> 26:02.090
Doesn't have to be out of wedlock.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.490
So we run down to City
Hall for a shotgun marriage,

26:04.540 --> 26:06.960
and eight months later, everyone knows why?

26:08.610 --> 26:10.100
So...

26:11.920 --> 26:13.300
You think that we should...

26:13.350 --> 26:16.140
I don't know what I think.

26:16.190 --> 26:20.910
I just know what will happen if we keep it.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.240
Not "it."

26:24.930 --> 26:27.320
"Her."

26:27.370 --> 26:29.620
Or "Paul Jr."

26:32.700 --> 26:34.960
All things are possible through Him.

26:35.770 --> 26:37.830
Yes, they are.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.130
- He made all this possible.
- Mm-hmm.

26:40.180 --> 26:41.730
He brought us to San Vicente,

26:41.780 --> 26:45.300
and He pointed us to Pernell Harris.

26:45.350 --> 26:48.940
Now we're ready to join
forces with Bishop Bruce.

26:48.990 --> 26:51.540
We are so close to being on TV.

26:51.590 --> 26:54.640
He made all that possible.

26:54.690 --> 26:56.680
We messed it up.

27:00.630 --> 27:02.180
Yeah.

27:04.670 --> 27:06.960
Yeah, we did.

27:08.940 --> 27:12.360
We can have more kids, Alicia,

27:12.410 --> 27:15.700
but I don't think we'll
get another chance at this.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.070
We can have other dreams.

27:22.290 --> 27:25.940
But isn't this the most important one?

27:25.990 --> 27:28.080
Serving God?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.690
I'll make the appointment.

29:05.020 --> 29:07.080
Damn, it's dark up in here.

29:07.130 --> 29:09.310
You having a séance or something?

29:26.440 --> 29:28.830
How you feeling, man?

29:49.530 --> 29:52.990
Oh, baby, you feel so good.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.360
Oh, God.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.460
You close?

29:59.510 --> 30:00.760
You ready, baby?

30:00.810 --> 30:04.400
PJ. Oh, God, PJ.

30:04.450 --> 30:06.270
What?

30:09.290 --> 30:11.610
PJ's dead.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.840
What?

30:13.890 --> 30:17.780
Not dead dead, but he's gonna be.

30:18.930 --> 30:22.080
Pernell, what are you talking about?

30:22.130 --> 30:24.390
- What happened?
- PJ!

30:24.440 --> 30:27.560
PJ, PJ, PJ, PJ...

30:27.610 --> 30:29.790
- PJ, PJ, PJ.
- Pernell.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.460
Stop, Pernell. I need you to talk to me.

30:31.510 --> 30:33.230
There's this boy,

30:33.280 --> 30:34.730
and he called,

30:34.780 --> 30:36.660
and his father didn't answer.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.030
And now he's got a hole in his head,

30:38.080 --> 30:41.100
and his father, he never understood him.

30:41.150 --> 30:44.170
He never even fucking tried!

30:44.220 --> 30:47.510
And now, now this boy's gonna die,

30:47.560 --> 30:49.410
and his father never answered.

30:50.830 --> 30:53.780
He lost his last fucking
chance to ever answer again.

30:53.830 --> 30:56.350
Pernell! No, stop!

30:56.400 --> 30:57.400
Stop!

30:59.400 --> 31:01.220
There's this boy.

31:01.270 --> 31:03.490
He's gonna die,

31:03.540 --> 31:06.090
not knowing his father wanted to answer.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.700
- Shh.
- He'll never know.

31:08.750 --> 31:11.930
He'll never know.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.370
He'll never know.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.130
KD?

31:43.180 --> 31:46.370
Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, God.

31:47.890 --> 31:49.840
Hey.

31:49.890 --> 31:51.870
Oh, God. Hey.

31:51.920 --> 31:52.870
Aw, Jesus.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.510
Hey! Hey, KD.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.640
Hey.

31:56.690 --> 31:59.050
Hey.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.080
What? Why are you here?

32:01.130 --> 32:02.720
I came for you. What are you doing?

32:02.770 --> 32:05.650
No, I...

32:05.700 --> 32:08.020
You've been good to me.

32:08.070 --> 32:10.120
Thank you. I would like
you to go now, please.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.460
No, I'm not going anywhere, KD.

32:11.510 --> 32:12.660
Whatever it is that you're thinking,

32:12.710 --> 32:14.330
I want you to stop, okay?

32:14.380 --> 32:16.460
Talk to me. Pray with me.

32:16.510 --> 32:19.300
No, no more talking.

32:19.350 --> 32:20.630
No more praying.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.070
I'd like to be alone now.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.140
- No.
- Please.

32:23.190 --> 32:24.140
No, I'm not going anywhere.

32:24.190 --> 32:26.540
Get the fuck out!

32:36.940 --> 32:39.720
Please just...

32:39.770 --> 32:41.990
Please!

32:54.750 --> 32:58.040
I've done terrible things.

32:58.090 --> 33:00.670
We've all done terrible things.

33:02.630 --> 33:04.580
No, you don't understand.

33:04.630 --> 33:06.110
I understand.

33:06.160 --> 33:10.020
I understand that if we
confess our sins to Him,

33:10.070 --> 33:13.090
God will forgive us, He will.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.490
And we can walk beside Him
in the Kingdom of Heaven.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.130
I can't.

33:17.180 --> 33:19.730
I... I have too many
marks to walk with God.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.600
- I have too many sins.
- No.

33:21.650 --> 33:24.600
- It's too late!
- No, it's never too late.

33:27.850 --> 33:28.940
No, don't do that.

33:28.990 --> 33:31.010
Jesus.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.940
I'm no damn good. I never have been.

33:32.990 --> 33:34.070
- No, I never was.
- No, KD.

33:34.090 --> 33:35.610
- Stop.
- Get out, now.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.810
- Get out!
- KD.

33:37.860 --> 33:39.580
I'm not leaving here without you!

33:39.630 --> 33:40.650
Come with me!

33:40.700 --> 33:41.950
That's not gonna happen.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.750
Please, don't do this, please.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.950
You better go right now.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.320
Don't you believe in God?

33:47.370 --> 33:49.360
I do...

33:49.410 --> 33:50.790
but I don't think He believes in me.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.630
I believe in you.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.600
Too late.

33:56.650 --> 33:57.650
Aah!

34:03.020 --> 34:06.310
- How long on the car?
- 30 minutes.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.110
What the hell are you doing?

34:08.159 --> 34:09.880
He's gonna want to see
this when he gets up.

34:12.830 --> 34:14.250
Car's coming to take him home.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.989
Try to at least get some pants on him.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.050
I'm not sure home's where he should go.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.790
He might need to see a doctor.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.520
He lost his son. Ain't nothing
a doctor can do about that.

34:22.570 --> 34:24.659
He just needed to get it out of his system.

34:24.710 --> 34:26.159
I don't know.

34:26.210 --> 34:28.230
I've seen a lot of people
in dark places before, but...

34:28.280 --> 34:30.130
Pernell ever mention
Brooks Innovations to you?

34:30.179 --> 34:31.770
A million times.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.070
Says it's supposed to
put San Vicente on the map

34:34.120 --> 34:35.199
like Google did Mountain View.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.900
Right, well, that can't happen

34:36.949 --> 34:39.239
if they hear Pernell's in the hospital.

34:39.290 --> 34:41.010
Life will go back to normal, trust me.

34:41.060 --> 34:44.310
Just get him in the car and get him home.

34:46.199 --> 34:48.820
Thank you.

34:48.870 --> 34:52.250
And again, I cannot stress the
part about the pants enough.

35:07.550 --> 35:08.440
You okay?

35:08.490 --> 35:10.300
- You okay?
- Yes.

35:10.350 --> 35:12.210
Leave me the fuck alone.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.640
No, KD, stop!

35:13.690 --> 35:16.740
If you go in, I go in.

35:16.790 --> 35:18.480
God damn you!

35:19.300 --> 35:20.810
God damn you.

35:36.510 --> 35:40.270
I used to think I didn't
fall apart like you

35:40.320 --> 35:42.370
because I was stronger,

35:42.420 --> 35:46.570
but now I realize it's because, if I did,

35:46.620 --> 35:49.310
there'd be nobody there
to pick up the pieces.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.080
I'd have tried.

35:53.130 --> 35:56.080
When would you have had the time?

35:56.130 --> 35:59.290
You have a job, a holy quest,

35:59.340 --> 36:01.490
at least one other wife.

36:10.150 --> 36:13.230
You know about Tessie.

36:13.280 --> 36:17.000
So... what?

36:17.050 --> 36:18.910
There was a...

36:18.960 --> 36:21.510
"buy one, get one free" deal

36:21.560 --> 36:23.110
at the jewelry store that day?

36:23.160 --> 36:26.650
It's not like that, Crys.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.650
I love you both.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.450
Fuck your love.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.850
You think it's a feeling.

36:31.900 --> 36:34.390
I have been there for
you when nobody else was.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.390
- Been there for me?
- I supported you.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.360
I tolerated this insanity.

36:37.410 --> 36:38.860
You were poisoning me.

36:38.910 --> 36:41.430
It was medicine you were supposed to take.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.200
And maybe if you had agreed to do it,

36:43.250 --> 36:44.810
you wouldn't be fucking here right now.

36:44.820 --> 36:47.240
What I needed was somebody I could trust,

36:47.290 --> 36:48.640
somebody who cared about me,

36:48.690 --> 36:50.240
not just somebody who wanted to prop me up.

36:50.290 --> 36:51.870
Fuck you!

36:53.690 --> 36:57.680
Do you know what I would
give not to care about you,

36:57.730 --> 37:00.950
not to give a shit that you
actually married somebody else?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.520
Because your ego can't handle it.

37:02.570 --> 37:05.190
Because I'm a fucking idiot,

37:05.240 --> 37:08.490
and I believed in this marriage.

37:08.540 --> 37:11.360
You really have no idea
what the last few months

37:11.410 --> 37:13.460
have been like, do you?

37:13.510 --> 37:16.700
Worrying about you, wondering.

37:20.820 --> 37:24.270
Wondering when the old Pernell
is ever going to come back.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.270
You mean the guy that was fucking hookers

37:25.320 --> 37:26.510
with your tacit permission

37:26.560 --> 37:28.280
as long as he kept up the Brooks deal?

37:28.330 --> 37:30.240
Is that the Pernell you miss?

37:32.460 --> 37:34.680
You are such a fucking prick.

37:34.730 --> 37:37.490
Yeah, while you have been marrying hookers

37:37.540 --> 37:39.590
and pledging your allegiance to Jesus,

37:39.640 --> 37:41.690
Bobo and I have been cleaning up your shit.

37:41.740 --> 37:44.930
Bobo and you.

37:44.980 --> 37:48.930
Well, if that's the case, you
may as well just go fuck Bobo.

37:48.980 --> 37:50.600
Oh, trust me,

37:50.650 --> 37:54.100
if he was as bad a friend
to you as you've been to him,

37:54.150 --> 37:56.340
I already would have.

38:01.290 --> 38:03.210
Car's downstairs.

38:03.260 --> 38:05.110
Get in it.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.980
Head straight home.

38:08.030 --> 38:10.220
Okay.

38:10.270 --> 38:12.450
Take care of yourself.

39:36.690 --> 39:38.710
Welcome to Hand of God chapel.

39:40.890 --> 39:43.880
Not really sure why I'm here.

39:43.930 --> 39:45.310
God led you here.

39:47.370 --> 39:49.520
Come on.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.530
Praise God.

41:41.580 --> 41:42.860
Hallelujah!

41:44.480 --> 41:46.330
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah.

41:46.380 --> 41:48.000
- Praise God!
- Praise God.

41:48.050 --> 41:51.100
Praise God. Praise God, brother.

41:51.150 --> 41:52.870
The Lord is with you. You are not alone.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.880
- You are not alone.
- Praise God, praise God.

42:04.540 --> 42:05.820
Repeat after me. Thank you, Jesus.

42:05.870 --> 42:07.820
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you, Jesus.

42:07.870 --> 42:09.390
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you, Jesus.

42:09.410 --> 42:10.690
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Louder.

42:10.740 --> 42:11.860
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Louder!

42:11.910 --> 42:13.460
- Thank you, Jesus!
- Louder!

42:13.510 --> 42:15.330
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Hallelujah!

42:15.380 --> 42:16.730
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

42:57.350 --> 42:59.670
I thought this was your car.

43:02.560 --> 43:06.310
Anne Wu, full of surprises.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.120
I'm so sorry, Crystal.

43:08.170 --> 43:10.750
I know how difficult this must be.

43:16.570 --> 43:18.030
Anne Wu, full of surprises.

43:18.080 --> 43:21.260
Look, I know that this
must feel like an invasion,

43:21.310 --> 43:24.800
but it is my job to find
out about these things and...

43:26.580 --> 43:30.640
Spying from the shadows,
it seemed dishonest.

43:30.690 --> 43:32.870
So you decided to tell me in person

43:32.920 --> 43:34.640
that you're invading my privacy?

43:34.690 --> 43:36.580
Crystal, please.

43:36.630 --> 43:39.050
Brooks is pouring nearly $1/4 billion

43:39.100 --> 43:40.210
into this project,

43:40.260 --> 43:42.050
and we have to be aware of the risks.

43:42.100 --> 43:43.720
Well, I'm sure you'll get a very satisfying

43:43.770 --> 43:45.250
pat on the head for this.

43:45.300 --> 43:48.060
Like I said, it's my job
to be aware of the risks,

43:48.110 --> 43:50.720
it's not always my job to report them.

43:52.110 --> 43:56.230
What's the cost of this generous silence?

43:59.150 --> 44:01.200
My sister was in an institution

44:01.250 --> 44:03.300
for most of her life.

44:03.350 --> 44:06.040
So more than most,

44:06.090 --> 44:08.810
I understand how trying this must be.

44:12.830 --> 44:15.680
I think you're very brave.

44:23.770 --> 44:25.960
Thank you.

44:36.950 --> 44:38.440
Thank you for showing me your love.

44:40.160 --> 44:44.140
Thank you for granting clarity
to someone so undeserving.

44:44.190 --> 44:47.820
Now I know, and a man
who knows his true calling

44:47.870 --> 44:49.050
must do everything in his power...

44:49.100 --> 44:50.340
- Yes, Lord.
- To live up to it.

44:51.870 --> 44:53.450
Now I devote myself to you.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.660
Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.

44:54.710 --> 44:55.990
Today and from this day forward.

44:56.010 --> 44:57.830
Hallelujah.

44:57.880 --> 45:01.230
In Mark, chapter 16, verses 15 to 16,

45:01.280 --> 45:04.060
Jesus said, "Go into the
world and preach the gospel"

45:04.110 --> 45:05.700
- to all creations."
Yes.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.670
"Whoever believes and is
baptized will be saved."

45:07.690 --> 45:08.970
Yes.

45:09.020 --> 45:10.940
"And whoever does not
believe will be condemned."

45:10.990 --> 45:12.310
Yes, Lord.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.320
Brother Pernell Harris,
based upon your profession

45:14.360 --> 45:17.280
of faith in Jesus Christ and
the confession of your sins...

45:17.330 --> 45:18.510
Yes, Lord.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.350
I now baptize you in the
name of the Father, the Son,

45:21.400 --> 45:22.850
and the Holy Spirit.

45:25.400 --> 45:29.490
Hallelujah.

45:34.380 --> 45:35.530
Praise Jesus.

45:35.580 --> 45:39.500
Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus!

45:39.550 --> 45:42.100
Hallelujah.

45:45.260 --> 45:49.710
Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus. Praise Jesus.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.810
Hallelujah!

45:59.740 --> 46:02.560
Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus.

46:02.610 --> 46:05.890
Say it. Say his name!

46:08.750 --> 46:10.360
Jesus.

46:10.410 --> 46:13.200
Praise God! Praise God!

46:13.250 --> 46:16.000
- Praise God!
- Hallelujah.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.050
Hey, it's PJ.

46:27.100 --> 46:28.780
This message will self-destruct

46:28.830 --> 46:30.580
in three, two, one.

46:32.270 --> 46:34.820
PJ, it's me.

46:40.510 --> 46:41.800
Hey, it's PJ.

46:41.850 --> 46:43.460
This message will self-destruct

46:43.510 --> 46:45.730
in three, two, one.

46:46.780 --> 46:50.000
PJ, it's me, pick up.

46:50.050 --> 46:52.610
Answer the phone, PJ.

46:52.660 --> 46:54.740
Hello?

46:54.790 --> 46:58.180
PJ, is that you?

46:58.230 --> 47:00.310
I need to see you, Dad.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.920
Come to me.

47:23.420 --> 47:26.470
It's time to stop fucking around.

47:28.190 --> 47:30.540
Is that what we're doing here?

47:30.590 --> 47:32.680
Tell me about finding God.

47:32.730 --> 47:35.350
He found me.

47:35.400 --> 47:40.190
After PJ shot himself, I let him in.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.420
He's the one that gave me my visions.

47:42.470 --> 47:43.420
Your hallucinations?

47:43.470 --> 47:44.790
Hallucinations, visions,

47:44.840 --> 47:47.460
whatever the fuck you want to call them.

47:47.510 --> 47:49.060
He led me to PJ's killer.

47:49.110 --> 47:51.160
No, PJ is PJ's killer.

47:51.210 --> 47:52.870
You know what I mean,

47:52.920 --> 47:54.630
the person who made PJ shoot himself.

47:54.680 --> 47:58.640
You never found him, did you?

47:58.690 --> 48:00.410
No.

48:00.460 --> 48:03.980
Worst hallucinations ever.

48:04.030 --> 48:07.210
Why do you want to wake PJ up?

48:10.370 --> 48:12.820
What the fuck kind of question is that?

48:12.870 --> 48:14.320
He's my son.

48:14.370 --> 48:16.920
Doesn't mean you don't
want something from him.

48:16.970 --> 48:18.730
Prince Charming woke up Sleeping Beauty

48:18.780 --> 48:19.730
so he could fuck her.

48:19.780 --> 48:21.530
Everybody has an agenda.

48:21.580 --> 48:24.360
Why do you want to wake up PJ?

48:24.410 --> 48:27.030
To talk to him.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.070
Tell him I love him.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.170
Tell him it's going to be all right.

48:31.220 --> 48:32.670
That what was gonna be all right?

48:32.720 --> 48:34.540
Whatever was eating at
him, whatever made him put

48:34.590 --> 48:35.640
the fucking gun in his mouth.

48:35.690 --> 48:37.210
Why was that your job?

48:37.260 --> 48:39.280
Because I'm his fucking
father. Jesus fucking Christ.

48:39.330 --> 48:42.120
So what could his father
do that his wife couldn't,

48:42.170 --> 48:44.850
that his mother couldn't,
that his friends couldn't do?

48:44.900 --> 48:47.420
They can't fucking take it back!

48:57.180 --> 49:00.530
What do you need the gun for?

49:00.580 --> 49:03.870
Home defense.

49:03.920 --> 49:05.410
What's wrong, PJ?

49:05.460 --> 49:07.010
The guy said if he was getting a gun,

49:07.060 --> 49:08.010
this is the gun he'd get.

49:08.060 --> 49:09.440
I know, just...

49:09.490 --> 49:11.410
Can I take a look at
some of the others again?

49:11.460 --> 49:14.150
Jesus Christ, we've
been here almost an hour.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.620
You've looked at every
goddamn gun in the store.

49:16.670 --> 49:18.630
They all shoot bullets at
bad guys. Just pick one.

49:18.640 --> 49:20.720
The bullets don't just hit bad guys.

49:20.770 --> 49:23.020
Guns are 20 times more likely
to be involved in an accidental

49:23.070 --> 49:24.390
or self-inflicted shooting.

49:24.440 --> 49:25.760
We're getting a gun because your wife

49:25.810 --> 49:27.630
got raped in her own home.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.260
She needs this to feel safe again. Man up.

49:30.310 --> 49:33.370
She'd feel safe if you kept your promise.

49:33.420 --> 49:34.600
Blame me.

49:34.650 --> 49:36.450
You said you'd find the
asshole that did this.

49:36.490 --> 49:37.940
You said you'd make sure he paid.

49:37.990 --> 49:39.040
I wouldn't have to find anybody

49:39.090 --> 49:40.440
if you hadn't been the pussy

49:40.490 --> 49:43.110
that sat back and watched
another man rape his wife.

49:50.630 --> 49:52.320
The gun's on me.

50:00.480 --> 50:04.330
That was the last time I talked to him,

50:04.380 --> 50:07.170
and I never got to take it back.

50:07.220 --> 50:11.910
I never got to fucking take it back.

50:11.960 --> 50:17.340
I never got to take it back.

50:17.390 --> 50:19.680
That's why you
manifested these visions

50:19.730 --> 50:21.580
and hallucinations.

50:23.830 --> 50:28.060
That's why so many of them came to you

50:28.110 --> 50:30.260
in the form of PJ's voice.

50:35.110 --> 50:36.430
The son you didn't talk to,

50:36.480 --> 50:39.370
the son that you would never talk to again.

50:43.690 --> 50:45.670
What if you're wrong?

50:48.260 --> 50:50.440
What if they're real?

50:52.360 --> 50:54.580
What if I really am called by God?

50:54.630 --> 50:56.320
Right.

50:57.800 --> 51:01.050
Wouldn't it be great if
God wanted what you wanted?

51:01.100 --> 51:04.060
How cool would it be that He
sent you on this holy mission

51:04.110 --> 51:07.160
to wake up your son?

51:07.210 --> 51:09.400
Then you could fix it.

51:11.350 --> 51:13.670
Then you could make up for everything.

51:20.090 --> 51:22.180
Then I could take it back.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.180
Questions? You want to question him.

51:29.230 --> 51:30.420
What does that mean?

51:30.470 --> 51:32.750
It means we want to ask him questions.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.290
But under what context?

51:34.340 --> 51:36.120
Under the context that
Josh Miller is missing

51:36.170 --> 51:37.520
and Pernell may be the
last person to see him.

51:37.570 --> 51:39.030
Josh who?

51:39.080 --> 51:41.490
PJ's best friend.

51:43.150 --> 51:46.130
Strange, right?

51:46.180 --> 51:48.040
- Is Pernell a suspect?
- Well, no.

51:48.090 --> 51:50.340
There's no crime yet, but
we still need to talk to him.

51:50.390 --> 51:53.540
Yeah, I don't know where he is.

51:53.590 --> 51:55.210
You can't get in touch with him?

51:55.260 --> 51:58.550
- Nope.
- Oh, so he's missing too?

51:59.960 --> 52:01.380
He's definitely not missing,

52:01.430 --> 52:03.850
but he can't talk, not for a few days.

52:03.900 --> 52:05.420
We can't wait a few days.

52:05.470 --> 52:07.050
Well, try.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.460
Gentlemen, after you.

52:12.340 --> 52:13.590
- You got the tickets?
- Yep.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.430
I'm in for a good show.

53:04.330 --> 53:05.650
Saved message.

53:05.700 --> 53:09.850
Sent Sunday, November 8th at 5:22 p.m.

53:12.270 --> 53:14.990
Hey, Dad, it's me.

53:15.040 --> 53:17.660
I know it's been a minute,

53:17.710 --> 53:20.530
but I really need to talk to you.

53:20.580 --> 53:21.760
Today.

53:21.810 --> 53:24.760
Please call me back.
