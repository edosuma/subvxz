WEBVTT

00:04.405 --> 00:05.739
Okay.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.208
Everything's all set
for the wedding.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.409
Coffee, please.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.743
We're, uh, meeting
the Justice of the Peace

00:09.843 --> 00:11.479
at the courthouse
at 4:15.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.448
So I've arranged the car to pick
us up at 3:45. Thank you.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.185
And I laid a dress
out for you on your bed.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.552
Oh, and I also
changed your sheets.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.421
'Cause I didn't wanna lay
the dress down on

00:20.521 --> 00:23.257
what appeared to be the better
part of a Denver omelet.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.692
Will,

00:24.792 --> 00:27.361
calm down,
it's a green card wedding.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.298
I don't need to brush my teeth,
fix my hair, put on lipstick--

00:30.398 --> 00:32.600
Hell, I don't even
need a head.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.636
Grace, if you're having
second thoughts about this,

00:35.736 --> 00:37.305
It is not too late
to call it off.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.472
You know I'll understand.

00:38.572 --> 00:39.607
Me too.

00:40.541 --> 00:40.574
Even though,
if you do back out,

00:41.375 --> 00:42.110
I'll be deported back
to Canada,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.345
and my life
will be destroyed.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.247
Have you ever been
to Canada?

00:46.347 --> 00:49.650
It's like Michigan
without any culture.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.254
I'm not backing out!

00:53.354 --> 00:55.223
I'm really looking
forward to this.

00:55.323 --> 00:56.724
For no other reason than
to send a holiday photo

00:56.824 --> 00:58.326
of James and me
to my mom.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.627
Whoo!

01:01.329 --> 01:03.097
Well, look...

01:03.197 --> 01:04.698
I just wanna say--
I know.
It's sweet of you--

01:04.798 --> 01:06.267
Yeah, but I need--
I--You--
Sweet of you--

01:06.367 --> 01:07.535
So you know?
I do.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.470
Okay, I'm just glad I got
a chance to say it to you.

01:10.104 --> 01:10.471
(Karen)
Oh!

01:10.904 --> 01:12.373
There they are.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.308
The Jewish woman
and the black man

01:14.408 --> 01:15.443
who are about
to get married.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.812
I get such a kick
that that's legal.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.781
So, James...

01:20.881 --> 01:26.287
[metal scraping]

01:26.387 --> 01:29.323
You didn't show up at your
bachelor party last night.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.458
Wait, what bachelor party?

01:30.558 --> 01:32.260
Jack offered to throw me

01:32.360 --> 01:34.162
a bachelor party
for the two of us.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.429
Me and him.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.165
I don't know
how he missed it.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.666
My invitation
was very clear.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.468
"What: Bachelor party.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.403
"Where: My place.

01:42.503 --> 01:46.106
When: After Will falls asleep."

01:46.207 --> 01:47.875
Honey, I've made
some arrangements

01:47.975 --> 01:49.310
for your wedding today.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.279
I reserved St. Patrick's
Cathedral.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.746
I know you're Jewish,

01:52.846 --> 01:56.250
but I couldn't find a bank or
a deli on such short notice.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.253
[upbeat jazz music]

01:59.353 --> 02:07.361
*

02:17.938 --> 02:19.407
What the f--

02:19.507 --> 02:20.608
Surprise!

02:20.708 --> 02:23.177
Smile!

02:23.277 --> 02:25.546
Whoa, you're not
gonna like that one.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.881
What's going on?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.383
Surprise wedding!

02:29.483 --> 02:30.618
Since we couldn't do
St. Patrick's

02:30.718 --> 02:32.486
'cause of the Funaway Bride
over here--

02:32.586 --> 02:35.389
Okay, I just came up
with that just now.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.526
See, it's clever

02:38.626 --> 02:42.863
because there's a movie
called Runaway Bride,

02:42.963 --> 02:46.467
and she took the fun away
from planning the wedding.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.502
So I called it
Funaway Bride.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.774
Instead of Runaway Bride.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.576
Runaway Bride is
the real title.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.912
[laughing]

02:59.012 --> 03:01.615
[panting]

03:01.715 --> 03:03.284
This is the first time

03:03.384 --> 03:05.853
I've thought I could
actually kill her.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.957
Well, look at this.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.693
All my friends together
in one room.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.663
And Rosario.
Hey.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.864
Karen, I told you

03:17.865 --> 03:18.966
that I didn't want
to make a big deal about this.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.635
Oh, my God, why do I smell
Polident and cabbage?

03:21.735 --> 03:24.204
Hello, dear.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.508
I hear you're marrying
a gay black man.

03:28.909 --> 03:33.581
Wouldn't it have been easier
to just run me over?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.283
Hi, Mom.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.618
Your wig's on backwards.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.820
Oh, I really need to draw
an arrow inside of it.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.522
Oh...

03:44.458 --> 03:45.959
Excuse us.
Hmm?

03:47.628 --> 03:48.596
Did you know
about this?

03:48.696 --> 03:49.697
No, of course not.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.599
I would never let them
invite your mother.

03:52.300 --> 03:52.833
God, if I'd been
planning this,

03:53.867 --> 03:54.535
I wouldn't have invited
a single person in there.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.805
We can hear you.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.308
You didn't let me finish--

04:00.408 --> 04:01.642
Except for Larry.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.378
[door slams]

04:04.478 --> 04:07.315
I think I patched that up.
So, look--

04:07.415 --> 04:08.649
I didn't want
to do this either.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.817
So why don't we just
go inside

04:10.784 --> 04:11.785
and tell them that
we just want a simple thing

04:11.885 --> 04:12.886
at the Justice of the Peace?

04:12.986 --> 04:15.489
Hey, guys.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.492
Or we march my very hot
boyfriend into that apartment

04:18.592 --> 04:20.794
and show him off in front
of all my friends.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.563
Sorry I'm so dressed up,
Grace.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.598
But, uh, Karen can be
very persuasive

04:24.698 --> 04:25.899
when you're in the tub
and she's there

04:25.999 --> 04:28.969
with a toaster
and garment bag.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.938
Hey, kids.
Everything okay?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.340
No, it's not okay.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.507
What did you do?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.443
I didn't do anything!

04:35.543 --> 04:37.311
I'm against
this whole charade.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.353
Did I pronounce that correctly?

04:45.453 --> 04:48.055
Against.
Yep.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.060
Honey, you've gotta make
your wedding look real

04:53.160 --> 04:54.628
for the INS.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.530
Now, come on,
got ya a dress and a ring,

04:56.630 --> 05:00.300
and Rosario's
gonna take some pictures.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.602
Believe me, she's better
behind the camera

05:01.702 --> 05:03.537
than in front of it.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.072
[moans]

05:05.172 --> 05:07.875
All this
for a pretend wedding?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.477
I'm not even
getting laid at the end.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.644
Am I?
No.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.646
Let him answer.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.650
(man)
I have to say,

05:16.750 --> 05:18.552
Will, when I heard James
was Canadian,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.821
I thought blech.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.356
But you know what?

05:22.456 --> 05:25.659
I didn't know they
made them like that.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.528
Yeah, glad you guys
like him.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.497
Like him?
I'd sell my mother

05:29.597 --> 05:32.600
to a cult just to see him
take off his shirt.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.504
And Grace gets
to marry him. Heh.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.506
I hate her.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.574
But you know,
James isn't just good-looking.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.411
He's also charming
and smart.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.046
And could pound me
like a piece of veal.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.552
What?
You guys were thinking it.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.920
I was.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.488
I am now.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.693
[clearing throat]
You know...

05:59.793 --> 06:03.130
You didn't hear it from me,
but, um...

06:03.230 --> 06:06.634
Will is going bald.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.669
It's not gonna be pretty.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.672
Look at my head.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.007
May I kiss it?

06:14.107 --> 06:16.944
No.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.546
So what's going on
up here?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.014
Yeah, um, I don't see
this working, okay?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.550
There, I said it.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.684
I didn't want
to say it,

06:23.784 --> 06:24.718
but now I've said it.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.854
I don't see this working.

06:31.659 --> 06:35.095
If he comes too close again,
blow this whistle.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.533
You know, I know--
I know we just want

06:39.633 --> 06:41.034
to do a simple thing
at the courthouse, but...

06:41.134 --> 06:42.536
it's kinda fun.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.505
It's exactly the way
I'd do my wedding, you know?

06:44.605 --> 06:47.441
Only Stevie Wonder would be here
to sing my favorite song.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.942
Mm.
Superstitious?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.112
Why? Is it bad luck to have a
blind guy sing at your wedding?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.081
No, the song.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.985
Oh, no, no no.
He'd sing As.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.488
You know, I won a lip-sync
contest at my high school

07:00.588 --> 07:01.789
doing a Stevie Wonder medley

07:01.889 --> 07:03.724
that ended
with Ebony and Ivory.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.693
My performance really
brought everybody together.

07:05.793 --> 07:09.830
You know, kids of all races...
beat me up.

07:09.930 --> 07:14.868
Uh, excuse me, is this
the Adler and Hanson wedding?

07:14.968 --> 07:17.070
Yes.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.507
Are you Hall & Oates?

07:19.607 --> 07:23.176
Actually,
it's Oates & Hall now.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.878
Yeah, every 25 years
we flip it.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.013
Uh, when I agreed to that,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.448
I didn't think
we'd last this long.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.452
God, it is so weird

07:32.553 --> 07:34.888
seeing myself
in a wedding dress again.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.223
It's--

07:36.323 --> 07:37.825
It's freaking me out
a little bit.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.860
I'm actually sweating.
Ha.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.829
Honey, you're finally wearing
a quality fabric.

07:41.929 --> 07:42.830
Your body's not sweating--

07:42.930 --> 07:44.231
It's crying with relief.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.640
It is an incredible dress.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.908
Thank you so much
for doing this.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.978
Probably is better that it look
real for the INS.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.749
That's not the only reason
I'm doing all of this, honey.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.084
I think what you're doing
for Will is...

08:04.184 --> 08:05.252
the most generous thing

08:05.352 --> 08:09.022
I've ever seen one friend
do for another.

08:09.122 --> 08:14.061
And it made me
wanna be generous to you.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.029
I'm just really proud
of you, Gracie.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.032
I just got sick
to my stomach.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.568
Yeah?
Well, screw you!

08:21.702 --> 08:22.069
I was just making conversation,
you ungrateful bitch!

08:22.936 --> 08:26.039
No! No, Karen, come back.
Come back.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.642
It's not what you said,
it's...

08:28.742 --> 08:29.877
I think it's just, uh,

08:29.977 --> 08:31.912
'cause I'm squeezed
into a size two.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.013
It's an eight.
Four.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.048
Six.
I'll take it.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.018
Hey, the Justice
of the Peace is here.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.219
[sighs]
Hi.
My God,

08:39.319 --> 08:40.220
you look incredible.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.922
Well, thank you, Will.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.624
You're not looking
too bad yourself.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.925
[giggling]

08:45.025 --> 08:46.727
I was talking to Grace.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.829
Yeah? Well, screw you,
you ungrateful bitch!

08:51.799 --> 08:53.300
Okay.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.768
Sweetie, if you're ready.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.104
Let's go marry
my boyfriend.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.106
Yeah, just gimme--
just gimme one second.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.676
Ever since I put this dress on,
I'm feeling a little sick.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.645
Wait a minute.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.780
You really not feel well
or is it just...

09:06.880 --> 09:08.882
having a wedding dress
on again is...

09:08.982 --> 09:10.651
bringing up all sorts
of Leo stuff?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.086
I don't know.
Maybe a little bit.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.724
But I still want to do this.
So...

09:16.824 --> 09:18.291
Get out there.
I'll be there in a second.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.961
Okay.
Oh, quick question, Karen.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.964
Did you hire Hall & Oates
for this wedding?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.166
Yes, I did,
and I was lucky to get them.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.168
Honey, that's one of
the most successful acts

09:28.268 --> 09:29.837
in the history of pop music.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.872
Oh, and after the service,

09:31.972 --> 09:34.642
Oates will do your caricature
for a dollar.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.579
Look, anything you need--

09:39.680 --> 09:41.114
[whistle blowing]
Jack!

09:46.353 --> 09:48.121
All righty.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.823
All right, the second
she walks down that aisle,

09:49.923 --> 09:51.158
I want to hear music.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.894
And I don't want to hear
"a track from your last album".

09:53.994 --> 09:56.764
It's a wedding,
not The Ellen Show.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.198
Okay, I understand,
I understand.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.067
All right.
Um...

10:00.167 --> 10:02.235
Let me ask you something.
Did we sleep together?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.904
In Dayton, Ohio, 1981?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.873
Maybe.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.876
Were you in that pile with
Chrissie Hynde and Joan Jett?

10:08.976 --> 10:10.077
[laughing]

10:12.145 --> 10:13.914
(Grace)
Okay...

10:14.014 --> 10:15.248
I'm ready.
Let's do it.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.017
Uh, Grace...

10:17.117 --> 10:19.186
may I walk you
down the aisle?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.221
That's so sweet.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.757
* Whoa, here she comes

10:23.857 --> 10:24.758
* Watch out, boy

10:24.858 --> 10:26.026
* She'll chew you up

10:26.126 --> 10:28.896
* Whoa, here she comes

10:28.996 --> 10:32.733
* She's a maneater *

10:32.833 --> 10:35.035
[fake laughs]

10:35.135 --> 10:36.103
Funny.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.872
Who knew Hall & Oates
were such a riot?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.007
(Karen)
Okay.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.108
Let's do it again.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.976
This time put down
those guitars

10:43.076 --> 10:44.344
and just hum
The Wedding March.

10:45.512 --> 10:45.979
That way you can still walk
around and refill drinks.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.347
Hit it.

10:48.782 --> 10:53.921
[both humming
The Wedding March]

10:54.021 --> 10:57.224
I can't believe she gets
to wear that beautiful dress.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.928
I kinda wanna trip her.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.931
What? You were
both thinking it.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.265
I was.
I am now.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.069
Now it's time for your vows,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.671
which I was told
you prepared yourselves?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.040
Oh, no, we're not
doing that.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.742
Right, and you can just skip

11:14.842 --> 11:16.376
the whole "you may kiss
the bride" thing too.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.211
No, that we're doing.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.851
Uh, I wanna hear vows.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.152
I paid 500 large
for this shindig.

11:25.252 --> 11:29.022
Brown Sugar goes first.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.093
Karen, I have asked you
not to call him that.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.762
It's offensive.

11:34.862 --> 11:38.265
And it makes it a little less
special when I do it.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.101
Okay, uh--
[clears throat]

11:41.201 --> 11:43.103
Grace, I...

11:43.203 --> 11:45.005
love your hair.

11:45.105 --> 11:48.976
It's a kind of red that you
really don't see that often.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.344
Outside of the Raggedy family.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.214
Well, he's quick on his feet.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.817
I don't know what
I would've said.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.251
He's pretty good.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.388
James.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.290
I vow...

12:03.390 --> 12:07.995
to...stand by you
or whatever.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.264
And I vow to...

12:11.364 --> 12:13.466
um...

12:13.566 --> 12:16.469
Wow, I just got dizzy.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.007
Okay, just got
a little barfy.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.509
It's so beautiful.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.149
Oh, my God, I'm crying.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.254
Are you okay?
Could we get some water here?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.924
Thanks, Oates.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.092
Here.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.193
No, I'm--
I'm okay.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.328
I don't even know
what ha--hap--

12:41.428 --> 12:43.030
Whoa, Grace.
I'm fine.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.131
I'm fine.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.432
[laughing]

12:45.532 --> 12:47.100
I'm fine.
It's just a little hot in here.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.235
Or something.
Okay, let's just keep going.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.436
No, no, no.
We're not doing this.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.437
I'm sorry, James.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.405
We need to talk.
Come here.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.374
Wait.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.543
Oof, not her day.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.419
[crying]
How dare you drag me
out of my wedding?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.889
I wanted everything
to be perfect.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.825
I'm totally kidding.
What's up?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.561
What's up?
You just fainted.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.929
Didn't faint.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.298
I barely Lindsay Lohaned.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.237
I don't think
you want to marry James.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.506
What?
Of course I do.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.574
I know you say
you're okay with it.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.342
But look at you.
You're falling apart.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.244
I mean, maybe your body's
trying to tell you

13:32.079 --> 13:33.847
that you're really
not okay with this.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.383
Will, my body's
not that smart.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.185
If it were,

13:38.285 --> 13:40.954
it would've stopped my feet
from growing at age 12

13:41.054 --> 13:45.825
and would've focused all
of its energy right up here.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.896
It's the dress.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.530
It's too tight.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.199
I swear, I wanna do this.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.501
I just wanna make sure that you
have thought this through.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.370
Because after today,
that's it--you're married.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.272
Uh, maybe you haven't noticed,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.975
but, uh, there hasn't been
a lot going on for me lately.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.443
No, no, I've noticed.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.046
But I mean,
what if you meet someone?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.314
You know, I don't want
my relationship with James

14:07.414 --> 14:09.082
to be the thing
that stops you.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.918
It's two years.

14:11.018 --> 14:14.221
And I get a gorgeous husband

14:14.321 --> 14:18.258
who doesn't care
if I cheat on him?

14:18.358 --> 14:21.194
A girl could do worse.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.363
So you're sure?
I'm sure.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.099
'Cause you're the most important
person in the world to me.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.868
And if there is
anything that I can do

14:28.969 --> 14:31.204
to help ensure your happiness,
I'm gonna do it.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.207
What did I do
to deserve you?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.375
A million things.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.977
Mm.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.581
And you're gonna do a million
more to keep deserving me.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.918
This is gonna be a really
expensive two years for me,

14:45.018 --> 14:46.954
isn't it, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.490
Hey.
Tall & Oates.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.292
Not paying you two

14:52.392 --> 14:53.460
to stand around.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.229
Guess I should've hired
Men At Work.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.631
Maybe we should
get in there

14:58.731 --> 15:00.300
and pick up
some dirty plates.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.337
I can't go for that.
No can do.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.939
Whoops.

15:06.039 --> 15:10.243
Now you gotta put a dollar
in the Old Lyric Jar.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.611
You and that jar.

15:12.779 --> 15:16.449
Sometimes I think we're never
gonna have that pizza party.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.918
Excuse me, you guys know Will
pretty well, don't ya?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.553
Uh, should I be worried?

15:20.653 --> 15:21.688
Oh, no.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.224
No, Will and Grace
do this all the time.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.393
They're always crawling off
into rooms

15:26.493 --> 15:30.430
to whisper or fight
or God knows what.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.100
Thanks, that's a relief.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.268
Sorry for freaking out
on you guys like that.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.637
That was freaking out?

15:37.737 --> 15:38.705
I don't know.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.008
Karen gave me
what she swore was a mint,

15:41.108 --> 15:43.010
but she shook it
out of an envelope.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.345
And now I can't feel
my tongue.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.017
Anyway, thanks.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.585
It's nice to not be
the only black guy in the room.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.292
I figured you out.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.729
You hate Canada.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.965
You do.
You hate Canada so much

16:06.066 --> 16:07.267
that you're willing
to marry Grace

16:07.367 --> 16:09.436
and pretend to be in love
with fat, bald Will

16:09.536 --> 16:11.004
so you don't have to go
back to that awful,

16:11.104 --> 16:14.441
frozen prison
where Superman lives.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.210
You know, I used to think
you were jealous of Will,

16:17.310 --> 16:19.446
but now I'm beginning to think
that you're jealous of me

16:19.546 --> 16:21.581
because I get
to be with Will.

16:26.053 --> 16:29.589
Well played, Canada.
Well played.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.658
But you're wrong.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.760
This has all been a test

16:33.860 --> 16:35.562
to see if your feelings
for my best friend

16:35.662 --> 16:37.097
are really true.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.032
And you passed.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.433
This time.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.001
But know this.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.038
I will always be
coming on to you.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.478
Always.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.413
When you turn a corner,

16:53.513 --> 16:55.348
I'll be there.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.150
Nude.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.554
To test you.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.325
Did I mention you're
allowed to fail one test?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.394
Will, he has earned you.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.262
Take good care of him.
And remember...

17:09.362 --> 17:10.763
nude.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.035
Did Jack just threaten
to be nude around a corner?

17:16.136 --> 17:18.571
Eh. It's hard
to be threatened by a guy

17:18.671 --> 17:22.075
who still writes L and R
on the bottom of his shoes.

17:22.175 --> 17:26.413
He took my whistle, Will.

17:26.513 --> 17:30.117
Oh, sweetie. Come here.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.084
It's so crazy today.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.420
I just wish we could get
a little time alone.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.155
* Private eyes

17:35.255 --> 17:37.290
* They're watching you

17:37.390 --> 17:40.093
* They see your every move *

17:40.193 --> 17:42.061
Oh, grow up, Hall and Oates!

17:42.162 --> 17:45.665
Okay. I'm ready.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.135
Oh, dear,
are you all right?

17:48.235 --> 17:52.505
Oh, you're makeup's so thick
I can't get a read.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.542
At least mine doesn't
come off in one piece.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.778
[laughing]
Woo! The wedding zinger.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.414
Okay. See what I did?

18:01.514 --> 18:05.118
The movie is called
The Wedding Singer.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.554
But Grace made a joke,

18:07.654 --> 18:10.357
so I changed it from
The Wedding Singer

18:10.457 --> 18:13.160
to The Wedding Zinger!

18:13.260 --> 18:14.827
So darn clever.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.564
All I did was literally
change one letter.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.732
That's all I did.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.236
Let's go, James.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.104
The quicker we do this,

18:25.205 --> 18:27.274
the quicker I get
out of my dress.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.708
It's a size two.

18:28.808 --> 18:29.842
I heard it was an eight.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.480
You want me to do this?
Okay, okay.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.183
Grace, you look
so radiant. Turn around.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.888
Wow. Looks like I'm gonna
be in Photoshop all night.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.727
Well, all right then.
Do you Grace--
I sure do.

18:47.827 --> 18:48.861
Do you James Alan--

18:48.961 --> 18:50.330
Can you just hold on
for a second?

18:51.398 --> 18:52.599
I mean, I do, but let me
just do this quick thing.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.367
I know this is supposed
to be our day,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.303
but I just wanted to do
something for our best man

18:56.403 --> 18:59.138
since I didn't have time
to buy him any cufflinks.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.841
[clears throat]

19:01.941 --> 19:03.410
* As around the sun

19:03.510 --> 19:05.678
* the Earth knows
she's revolving *

19:05.778 --> 19:07.580
Stevie Wonder.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.819
* And the rosebuds know
to bloom in early May *

19:12.919 --> 19:15.154
* As hate knows
love's the cure *

19:15.255 --> 19:18.157
* You can rest
your mind assure *

19:18.258 --> 19:23.596
* That I'll be
loving you always *

19:23.696 --> 19:25.198
(Jack)
Oh, yeah.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.176
I'm a test you.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.683
You know, as rocky
as that wedding started out,

19:43.783 --> 19:45.418
it turned out to be
pretty great.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.520
My favorite part?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.822
You sang Stevie Wonder to me.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.825
I sang Stevie Wonder?

19:55.462 --> 19:57.196
Yeah. You sang As.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.399
Wow.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.501
Karen's pills were amazing.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.436
You don't remember
singing it?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.273
Un-uh. I don't even
know that song.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.877
Ah. Hey, Will.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.880
Hey, Grace.
I love your hair like that.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.848
Karen, silly!
That's not Grace.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.485
That's James,
Grace's other gay husband.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.422
Tempted?

20:22.522 --> 20:23.556
No.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.926
What if I hadn't
just eaten herring?

20:29.596 --> 20:30.930
Oh, hey.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.400
There you are.
Where'd you get off to so early?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.735
Oh, I still wasn't
feeling well this morning,

20:35.835 --> 20:37.437
so I went to the doctor.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.905
Oh, sweetie, you are sick.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.007
No, I'm--I'm not sick.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.475
I'm pregnant.
