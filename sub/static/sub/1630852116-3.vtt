02:00.245 --> 02:02.455
Hey, why is the alarm going off?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.541
I shorted out the security system, dude!

02:04.624 --> 02:07.085
I bet you gave us bad luck!

02:07.168 --> 02:10.004
What? Me? I didn't do anything.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.006
-Hurry! Split!
-Goddamnit!

02:16.594 --> 02:17.762
Are you kidding me?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.139
Maybe it was me.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.103
Fly, man! Full throttle!

02:25.687 --> 02:26.855
Right!

02:27.939 --> 02:30.024
-Johnny!
-I'm on it.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.703
Reminds me of my childhood.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.290
Fellow citizens,
riding the train is much safer.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.127
For fuck's sake!
If that damn alarm hadn't rung!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.880
Don't worry about a touch of bad luck.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.091
They say good luck
often comes disguised as bad luck.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.926
Isn't it the other way around?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.846
Fuck off! You just store up that bad luck!

03:00.471 --> 03:03.558
That's not exactly how it works, you know.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.018
Don't you worry!

03:05.643 --> 03:08.271
San Francisco's got
hardly any superheroes!

03:08.771 --> 03:10.732
I'm getting a bad feeling.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.278
Thieves headed north
out of the Financial District.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.654
Calling for backup.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.490
The thieves apparently have superpowers.

03:19.574 --> 03:23.036
I repeat.
The thieves apparently have superpowers.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.291
On my way from Jackson Square.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.172
I can't believe
there are still idiot villains around.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.760
Requesting hero assistance.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.929
Don't forget your job, people.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.515
The San Francisco Police
will catch them before any hero gets here.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.653
That was close!

03:56.736 --> 03:57.904
Bye!

04:01.324 --> 04:04.327
Don't underestimate
the San Francisco Police.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.248
-Hey, you better pay up!
-It's only a scratch!

04:20.468 --> 04:21.678
Crap.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.441
I bet they've got weak-ass powers anyway.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.758
Nice work!

05:01.634 --> 05:02.760
Right!

05:04.971 --> 05:06.180
Quit celebrating!

05:06.806 --> 05:09.809
We were supposed to escape
while the cops were still confused!

05:09.892 --> 05:11.811
Quit getting so scared!

05:11.894 --> 05:13.938
Stop right now! Stop!

05:14.022 --> 05:16.441
You've changed since you started
dating that woman.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.358
What?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.986
I bet you're worried
about what Kasey will think.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.362
That's not true.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.280
Hey!

05:22.363 --> 05:23.865
-They're going to crash into us!
-Stop!

05:29.162 --> 05:30.913
All right.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.341
Don't you worry!
We're at the top of our game!

05:42.425 --> 05:45.511
Johnny, if we get away,
Kasey will never find out.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.558
Two Green Power Smoothies for table three.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.564
We've received reports
that the robbers on the run

05:56.647 --> 05:58.983
are supervillains with superpowers.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.318
Local residents are advised…

06:00.943 --> 06:02.612
Our smoothies are taking forever.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.490
I bet she forgot to submit our order.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.826
That's what I thought too!
That waitress was pretty rude.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.745
I think I'll complain.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.038
You do that, girl.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.248
Say, lady…

06:17.794 --> 06:19.295
Here are your smoothies.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.185
Enjoy!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.479
Transmit!

06:36.562 --> 06:37.688
Right!

06:40.149 --> 06:43.069
Stay focused!
Screw up once and we're goners!

06:44.946 --> 06:48.157
Hey! Is it true?
This is the Network's plan?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.325
What?

06:49.408 --> 06:51.410
That big supervillain organization!

06:51.994 --> 06:53.454
What? How did you…

06:53.538 --> 06:54.831
Look out ahead!

06:57.792 --> 06:59.794
Focus on escaping for now!

06:59.877 --> 07:01.879
I hope no superheroes come.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.172
Don't think about it!

07:03.256 --> 07:05.550
If you don't want it to happen,
it will anyway!

07:05.633 --> 07:07.927
I told you, that's not how it works!

07:08.010 --> 07:09.011
Right!

07:09.095 --> 07:10.763
How long are we going to wait?

07:11.347 --> 07:14.600
Request any superhero that's around now!

07:14.684 --> 07:15.768
We did!

07:15.852 --> 07:16.686
Fuck!

07:16.769 --> 07:20.565
One was nearby
and will arrive in a few minutes.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.318
Be honest with me, Johnny.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.154
This gets your blood pumping, right?

07:26.237 --> 07:29.449
I'm sure as fuck that I ain't going back
to the slammer, not even for a day!

07:30.032 --> 07:32.285
Just sitting in the sidecar sure is easy.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.327
What?

07:33.411 --> 07:34.620
What did you say, Kismet?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.998
Are you dissing me?

07:38.332 --> 07:39.375
I'll handle this!

07:48.342 --> 07:50.178
Yippee ki-yay, motherfuck--

07:50.261 --> 07:53.473
My boy is a huge fan of
The Union of Justice.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.433
Oh, really? My boy is a bigger--

07:56.767 --> 08:00.438
Fuck The Union of Justice!

08:09.280 --> 08:10.406
That was cool!

08:11.115 --> 08:12.074
I told ya!

08:12.158 --> 08:14.785
This is what you need, Johnny.

08:14.869 --> 08:18.331
Remember, good luck comes
disguised as bad luck.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.292
Usually, bad luck
just ends up bringing more bad luck.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.712
The day after my cat died, my granny died.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.177
Hey! Didn't your batshit crazy granny
eat your cat and die of food poisoning?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.554
No, she… Oh, yeah…

08:36.682 --> 08:38.309
What the…

08:38.392 --> 08:41.646
-Isn't that a superhero…
-Aw, fuck…

08:47.693 --> 08:50.321
And I thought San Francisco would be safe.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.494
Hey!

09:05.586 --> 09:06.712
Shit, he's fast!

09:13.803 --> 09:16.138
Wear some shoes, you freakin' savage!

09:18.099 --> 09:19.809
Don't get stepped on, guys!

09:26.732 --> 09:28.192
Over here!

09:30.403 --> 09:33.239
With that huge gut,
it must be hard to see, huh?

09:46.168 --> 09:47.336
Take that!

09:48.379 --> 09:51.591
Hit him with a massive dose of bad luck!

09:51.674 --> 09:54.635
Your luck runs out now!

10:10.151 --> 10:13.487
At last, this glorious day has arrived.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.033
The chemical warfare gas
we've worked on for many years to perfect

10:17.116 --> 10:19.368
is finally ready to be delivered.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.872
We must be even more careful
than usual today.

10:22.955 --> 10:27.335
Everyone,
be extremely careful as you work.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.349
Sorry, pal.
The only luck I've got is bad luck.

10:47.938 --> 10:51.484
If we can get there,
the chopper we hired will meet us.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.236
Okay, we can do this! We can do it, dudes!

10:54.320 --> 10:55.613
Didn't I tell you?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.741
-Don't make that chopper crash.
-That's not how…

11:00.076 --> 11:01.160
I'll be careful.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.244
Hey!

11:06.290 --> 11:07.124
Hey!

11:21.764 --> 11:23.099
Hey, people of San Francisco!

11:27.645 --> 11:29.855
Now that I'm here,
everything will be all right!

11:29.939 --> 11:31.315
The fuck is that?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.025
Say cheese!

11:33.609 --> 11:35.403
That's The Rubberball.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.821
The Rubberball?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.240
What a great smile!

11:39.323 --> 11:40.908
I sent it to your phones,

11:40.991 --> 11:42.952
so just call if you ever need me.

11:43.536 --> 11:47.998
He's some young superhero
who showed up while you were in Supermax.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.584
What the fuck's wrong with this country?

11:50.668 --> 11:53.170
It breeds heroes like cockroaches.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.631
I'm back. Let's get this over with.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.300
At this speed, we're too fast for TV.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.182
Damn it! He's too fast!

12:05.766 --> 12:07.435
Hey, now! Better watch out!

12:08.477 --> 12:10.646
You don't move so fast with that sidecar.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.784
Wow! Look what you can do!

12:23.868 --> 12:25.286
That's so cool!

12:29.415 --> 12:30.875
You could kill ordinary citizens!

12:30.958 --> 12:32.626
You call yourself a superhero?

12:33.836 --> 12:37.006
The other day,
I took down this one villain.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.508
I wonder if he was a pal of yours.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.052
His legs were totally crushed.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.263
I doubt he'll ever walk again.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.224
Apologize for me
when you see him in Supermax.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.311
Take this!

12:53.856 --> 12:57.276
No matter what you try,
you can't hurt me physically.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.153
My name's The Rubberball, after all!

13:02.239 --> 13:03.491
That's one down.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.617
Gosh!

13:05.493 --> 13:08.913
Wow! Awesome! That's super useful!

13:10.164 --> 13:12.500
Hold on tight!

13:59.088 --> 14:02.216
Yeah!

14:43.841 --> 14:46.010
You'd better quit fooling around!

14:46.093 --> 14:49.388
This is the kind of thing
that ticks me off the most!

14:53.100 --> 14:54.768
I told you, it doesn't hurt me!

14:57.813 --> 15:01.483
May bad things happen!

15:11.994 --> 15:13.412
The hell is that?

15:13.495 --> 15:15.497
How are we supposed to take this guy down?

15:19.585 --> 15:20.586
It's over for you!

15:21.170 --> 15:23.339
Time to say bye-bye, you crooks!

15:27.718 --> 15:29.386
Shit! We're almost at the bridge!

15:31.138 --> 15:33.390
You're a bigger murderer than any villain!

15:33.474 --> 15:34.558
Justice will prevail!

15:34.642 --> 15:37.019
Frost! Launch your cold blast at me!

15:42.650 --> 15:43.484
Okay!

15:46.487 --> 15:47.655
How lame!

16:04.922 --> 16:06.715
Wait! No!

16:07.299 --> 16:11.637
You see, as a newbie,
I just wanted to show off what I can do!

16:12.304 --> 16:15.265
I'm seriously sorry! I got carried away!

16:15.349 --> 16:17.184
My girl just dumped me, so…

16:17.267 --> 16:19.061
-You talk too much.
-I lost my cool!

16:30.280 --> 16:31.991
I doubt he'll walk again.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.493
He can still roll.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.207
They took out The Rubberball too?

16:40.290 --> 16:41.250
Apparently so.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.752
What's the point
of these superheroes anyway?

16:51.802 --> 16:52.720
This guy…

16:57.433 --> 17:00.310
Frostbite, you were right!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.312
This is how I like to live!

17:02.396 --> 17:04.565
We screwed up at first

17:04.648 --> 17:07.484
but ended up teaching
those superheroes a lesson.

17:08.110 --> 17:12.448
That stuff about good luck coming
disguised as bad luck just might be right.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.534
Not "might." It's the truth!

17:15.617 --> 17:18.912
I appreciate you guys!
You've opened my eyes!

17:19.413 --> 17:20.873
Right!

17:22.291 --> 17:27.046
The mission celebrating
Johnny Bolt's release is a total success!

17:28.630 --> 17:31.050
Good luck comes disguised as bad…

17:32.384 --> 17:33.218
What?

17:34.053 --> 17:34.887
What?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.271
Where are we?

17:44.354 --> 17:45.272
Did you screw up?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.107
No.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.541
Hey, it's morning.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.544
Wake up, boys.

19:34.089 --> 19:39.094
