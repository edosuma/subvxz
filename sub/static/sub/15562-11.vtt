WEBVTT

00:00.320 --> 00:02.520
What does it mean to change?

00:02.554 --> 00:04.955
To embrace progress?

00:04.990 --> 00:07.158
To transform?

00:07.192 --> 00:10.917
Cloud 9 is pleased to announce
that our in-store brand "Halo"

00:10.917 --> 00:13.400
has now become "SuperCloud."

00:15.388 --> 00:17.420
A new day has dawned.

00:19.792 --> 00:22.143
All right, there you have it.

00:22.144 --> 00:24.212
So it's a big day today.

00:24.247 --> 00:25.747
We start our rebranding.

00:25.781 --> 00:29.050
Does rebranding mean
they're redesigning the store?

00:29.085 --> 00:31.843
No, we'll be taking our
in-store product "Halo"

00:31.882 --> 00:34.389
and changing it to "SuperCloud."

00:34.423 --> 00:36.391
And how are they different?

00:36.425 --> 00:39.227
That, uh, what I just said.

00:39.262 --> 00:40.629
It used to be called "Halo."

00:40.663 --> 00:43.352
Now it's called SuperCloud.

00:44.767 --> 00:47.956
- Oh.
- Maybe I'm not, um, selling

00:47.956 --> 00:49.604
the excitement
of what's happening today.

00:49.639 --> 00:50.928
Let's see if this helps.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:10.480 --> 01:13.309
Wow, that song is a little
longer than I thought.

01:13.311 --> 01:14.710
- What was that, 11 minutes?
- 12

01:14.711 --> 01:16.478
All right, anyway... 12?
Sorry about that.

01:16.512 --> 01:19.314
Uh, moving on, we have buttons

01:19.348 --> 01:20.882
for everybody to wear today,

01:20.916 --> 01:25.055
and there's a VP coming in
to oversee this rollout.

01:25.056 --> 01:26.287
A VP of corporate?

01:26.322 --> 01:27.789
I'm gonna need to borrow
somebody's lipstick.

01:27.823 --> 01:29.657
Not Amy's... way too slutty.

01:29.692 --> 01:30.959
Who's that lady?

01:30.993 --> 01:32.794
Oh, that's Kelsey, from Cloud 9.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.411
She's the new SuperCloud mascot.

01:35.431 --> 01:38.993
Why is a smiling white
lady always the mascot?

01:38.993 --> 01:42.130
'Cause in my experience, usually
they're, like, the first to snap.

01:42.130 --> 01:42.940
She's not wrong.

01:42.942 --> 01:45.199
I personally blame all the
yogurt white ladies eat.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.668
Why didn't they make it a superhero?

01:47.702 --> 01:50.104
You know, 'cause SuperCloud?

01:50.138 --> 01:53.941
And it could have, like,
a cape or something,

01:53.975 --> 01:55.838
and, like, little cloud muscles.

01:56.811 --> 01:58.545
Yeah, wow, that's...

01:58.580 --> 02:01.148
Clean, it's simple, it's visual, that...

02:01.182 --> 02:02.983
is probably what
it should've been. Damn.

02:03.018 --> 02:04.818
So all right, let's just move on.

02:04.853 --> 02:06.020
Here are some words

02:06.054 --> 02:08.295
we'd like you guys to pepper in
to the conversation today

02:08.297 --> 02:11.263
whenever SuperCloud comes
up, obviously, so "cool,"

02:11.298 --> 02:13.716
"millennial," "on fleek..."

02:15.138 --> 02:17.106
Have to go back to the superhero mascot,

02:17.140 --> 02:18.753
I'm so sorry, that's just a home run.

02:18.754 --> 02:23.356
Yeah, and he could be
saving people with savings.

02:23.391 --> 02:24.824
[Bleep], that's good.

02:31.766 --> 02:33.033
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yeah?

02:33.067 --> 02:34.868
Where is the Halo toilet paper?

02:34.902 --> 02:36.469
I could only find this stuff.

02:36.496 --> 02:37.825
Yeah, this is our new product line:

02:37.826 --> 02:40.874
the SuperCloud, and I have
been ordered to tell you

02:40.908 --> 02:42.576
how excited I am about it.

02:42.610 --> 02:44.177
But I like Halo.

02:44.612 --> 02:47.714
Right, well, apologies,
but we've actually shifted

02:47.748 --> 02:49.716
completely to SuperCloud.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.952
This is not a good time
in my life for this.

02:52.348 --> 02:54.052
Rachel just broke up with me.

02:54.655 --> 02:57.057
I don't know who that is.

02:57.091 --> 02:58.857
I thought I knew who she was.

03:00.094 --> 03:01.094
You know, I gotta tell ya...

03:01.128 --> 03:02.562
Ooh, look out, ladies.

03:02.597 --> 03:04.130
Here comes a stylish dude.

03:04.165 --> 03:06.399
Yeah, somehow he makes
baldness look cute.

03:06.434 --> 03:07.434
Hey, I'm not talking about Jeff.

03:07.468 --> 03:09.046
I'm talking about the other guy.

03:09.837 --> 03:11.972
Yeah, obvs. I was kidding.

03:12.006 --> 03:15.475
Jeff is like the ugliest
guy in the world.

03:15.509 --> 03:16.910
So busted.

03:16.944 --> 03:18.901
Like stretched-out Danny DeVito.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.034
Hey, guys, excuse me.

03:20.036 --> 03:22.415
I want you to meet Rex Joshi.
He's in from the main office.

03:22.450 --> 03:24.684
Hey, call me Mr. Joshi.
Pleasure to meet you.

03:24.719 --> 03:26.987
So good to meet you.
So good to meet you guys.

03:27.021 --> 03:28.855
We are so excited

03:28.889 --> 03:30.140
about this SuperCloud.

03:30.258 --> 03:32.592
We think it's going
straight up to the sky.

03:32.627 --> 03:34.761
So who's gonna help me get out there

03:34.795 --> 03:37.430
and make this rollout huge?

03:37.465 --> 03:39.699
Big success. Who's with me?

03:39.734 --> 03:40.934
You have a lot of hand gestures.

03:40.968 --> 03:42.535
Always doing something with those hands.

03:42.603 --> 03:43.569
- You betcha.
- Oh, okay.

03:43.571 --> 03:44.537
- One of those.
- Pshew.

03:44.572 --> 03:45.939
One more time. Stick shift.

03:45.973 --> 03:48.608
We could do that all day.

03:48.643 --> 03:50.210
Hey, sorry to interrupt, guys,

03:50.244 --> 03:52.712
but these boxes really
need to be uniform.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.447
Thank you, sorry, I just
gotta stay on top of them.

03:54.482 --> 03:55.448
Yeah, I'll make sure they fix it.

03:55.483 --> 03:56.449
Please do.

03:56.484 --> 03:57.617
You are management,

03:57.652 --> 03:59.036
so you're most at fault here.

03:59.754 --> 04:01.121
Okay, let's head over
to Sporting Goods, Rex.

04:01.155 --> 04:02.489
- Sure, yeah.
- Make sure things are in order.

04:02.523 --> 04:03.957
Ooh, that was cold.

04:03.991 --> 04:06.126
Um, have you decided who you're gonna

04:06.160 --> 04:08.695
take this out on later?
'Cause last week it was me...

04:08.729 --> 04:09.562
Elias!

04:09.597 --> 04:10.997
That is not how you climb a ladder,

04:11.032 --> 04:12.586
you [Bleep] turd!

04:16.070 --> 04:18.571
Hey, Cheyenne, can you
go wake up this lady

04:18.606 --> 04:20.640
that fell asleep in Electronics?

04:20.675 --> 04:21.841
Last time I tried something like that,

04:21.875 --> 04:23.543
I got punched in the beans.

04:23.577 --> 04:26.513
Um, can I just buy some of
this discounted Halo stuff

04:26.547 --> 04:27.580
for my baby first?

04:27.615 --> 04:28.815
It's normally so expensive

04:28.849 --> 04:30.750
I can barely afford her eye shadow.

04:30.785 --> 04:32.252
Okay, but you know
you're not supposed to

04:32.286 --> 04:34.821
buy things while
you're clocked in, right?

04:34.855 --> 04:38.058
Well, can I set it aside
for later before it sells out?

04:38.092 --> 04:39.861
Not supposed to but...

04:41.878 --> 04:43.163
Okay, I'm sorry, no.

04:43.221 --> 04:45.155
You'll have to do it
when your shift's over.

04:45.156 --> 04:48.038
_

04:48.149 --> 04:49.836
_

04:50.529 --> 04:54.377
_

04:54.378 --> 04:56.378
_

04:58.612 --> 05:00.213
No, I-I'm telling you, they...

05:00.247 --> 05:01.715
they feel exactly the same

05:01.749 --> 05:03.950
because they are exactly the same.

05:03.984 --> 05:06.119
Well, let me at least try your belly.

05:06.153 --> 05:07.152
I'm not gonna...

05:08.245 --> 05:11.239
Fine, but just be careful. I'm ticklish.

05:11.241 --> 05:13.127
Um, everything okay over here?

05:13.160 --> 05:15.562
Keep moving, I'm a Cloud
Club Rewards Member.

05:15.596 --> 05:17.086
- It's not a big deal.
- Jonah?

05:18.999 --> 05:21.935
- Rex?
- Wait, I'm sorry, you know him?

05:21.969 --> 05:23.870
Yeah, we went to business
school together.

05:23.904 --> 05:26.039
Dude, what the hell are you doing here?

05:26.073 --> 05:28.309
Could you pull that up
a little bit higher?

05:30.077 --> 05:32.579
- Pull it up higher?
- I heard you.

05:33.369 --> 05:35.635
Anyway, I just started driving, and...

05:35.670 --> 05:38.582
and then I saw that
they were hiring here

05:42.542 --> 05:44.998
- That's... that's great.
- Yeah.

05:45.101 --> 05:46.067
Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.

05:46.068 --> 05:47.469
I would've figured you were
one of those guys who are on

05:47.504 --> 05:49.255
a voyage of self-discovery.

05:49.257 --> 05:49.839
Oh.

05:49.873 --> 05:52.374
You know, backpacking through
Asia, rolling cigars in Cuba.

05:52.409 --> 05:54.143
Or, as Jonah would say, "Coo-ba."

05:54.241 --> 05:55.208
- He does that?
- Yeah.

05:55.824 --> 05:57.093
Should I be embarrassed that I pronounce

05:57.095 --> 05:58.362
it the way native Coo-banos do, or...?

05:58.364 --> 05:59.718
- You should.
- Okay.

05:59.953 --> 06:00.829
Iceman.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.125
I mean, look at you, man.
It has been too long.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.610
I'm sorry, we're gonna need to
take it back to "Iceman"?

06:05.611 --> 06:07.943
Yeah, that was my nickname in school.

06:07.976 --> 06:11.121
They, uh, you know, ice in the
veins, cool and collected.

06:11.129 --> 06:13.752
It's because you were always cold
in class. You had that afghan.

06:13.755 --> 06:15.824
That was a blazer.
That was a knit blazer.

06:15.825 --> 06:17.899
Oh, my God. You're Iceman.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.103
I'm gonna hear this again, aren't I?

06:19.104 --> 06:21.429
Yes, Iceman, you are, Iceman.

06:21.932 --> 06:24.300
"You're the manager, so
you're the most at fault here."

06:24.335 --> 06:27.070
- That guy really sucks.
- Total asshat, right?

06:27.104 --> 06:29.939
- I hate his little eyes.
- I hate his stupid face.

06:29.974 --> 06:31.912
I literally hope he dies.

06:32.810 --> 06:33.463
What?

06:34.278 --> 06:37.146
Yeah, I... I hope he does.
I hope he dies.

06:37.181 --> 06:38.582
I really hope he dies.

06:40.184 --> 06:41.307
Just dead.

06:42.286 --> 06:46.789
Our team formulated a plan
that featured WOM marketing,

06:46.824 --> 06:50.126
message-sending, and,
of course, fluid branding...

06:50.160 --> 06:51.995
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

06:52.029 --> 06:53.129
Look at that little suit.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.998
- It's like his bar mitzvah.
- Aww.

06:55.032 --> 06:56.733
It looks like a normal-size suit to me.

06:56.767 --> 06:59.302
All those words, and you
said absolutely nothing.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.170
Oh, Rex, thank you
for giving us this gift.

07:01.205 --> 07:02.805
Okay, I think we've seen enough.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.907
Ah!

07:16.333 --> 07:18.417
I need to pull off the veil of secrecy.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.456
What are you doing? What is that?

07:20.491 --> 07:22.489
Is that something you've practiced?

07:22.552 --> 07:25.161
Just a couple times in the
mirror, don't worry about it.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.096
Okay, listen. I know you're really

07:27.131 --> 07:30.300
stressed out, but, okay,
this isn't you, okay?

07:30.334 --> 07:32.210
People are starting to complain.

07:32.212 --> 07:32.836
Who?

07:32.870 --> 07:34.304
Just, people, okay?

07:34.775 --> 07:37.573
Dina didn't like the way you talked
to her in front of everybody.

07:37.573 --> 07:38.671
She called you an asshat.

07:38.673 --> 07:41.101
An asshat? Well, that's hurtful.

07:41.611 --> 07:44.477
Uh, but I will try to do better.

07:45.481 --> 07:47.916
And just since the veil
of secrecy is off,

07:47.950 --> 07:51.586
I feel like you've been mentioning
your ex-boyfriend a little too much.

07:52.046 --> 07:52.796
Not the time.

07:53.322 --> 07:53.807
Got it.

07:54.791 --> 07:55.759
Veil on.

07:57.726 --> 07:59.943
I love that you and
Chad are still close.

08:00.430 --> 08:03.465
Direct WOM management
and indirect WOM management...

08:03.499 --> 08:05.967
Garrett, can you please formulate

08:06.002 --> 08:08.270
a global strategy to fold

08:08.304 --> 08:10.686
the yoga pants in Softline?

08:10.719 --> 08:13.988
I will fold them along
multiple distribution channels.

08:13.990 --> 08:16.258
Very clever. So great to
reconnect with you, Rex.

08:16.292 --> 08:18.326
You know what? Blech, that's kind of

08:18.361 --> 08:20.367
a boring topic, unless...

08:22.532 --> 08:23.532
You rap about it.

08:26.369 --> 08:28.069
- Jonah!
- Okay, party's over.

08:28.104 --> 08:29.337
I love hip-hop.

08:29.372 --> 08:31.106
Hey, at least now, when you go back,

08:31.140 --> 08:32.741
you know what not to do.

08:32.775 --> 08:34.482
What do you mean, "go back"?

08:34.578 --> 08:35.977
When he goes back to school.

08:36.011 --> 08:37.695
Your enrollment's still active.

08:37.797 --> 08:40.948
Yeah, they said I could defer
for two years, so...

08:40.982 --> 08:44.352
But you're not actually
planning on going back,

08:44.387 --> 08:45.518
are you?

08:45.518 --> 08:47.886
I mean, I hadn't given it much thought.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.445
I mean, I... I was not happy there,

08:50.654 --> 08:53.642
so, but you know. I'm not sure.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.493
That's not a no, Jonah!

08:55.528 --> 08:57.562
That's not a no!

08:58.198 --> 09:00.899
Nice job with this area, everyone.

09:01.354 --> 09:02.791
Good job managing, Dina.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.824
Thank you, Jeff.

09:05.727 --> 09:08.796
Oh, also, uh, sorry if I've
been a little bit harsh lately,

09:08.831 --> 09:10.269
but if anybody has a problem with me,

09:10.269 --> 09:13.936
I prefer they say it to my face
than call me an asshat

09:13.970 --> 09:15.063
behind my back.

09:16.676 --> 09:18.095
Good job with this area.

09:24.514 --> 09:27.983
Well, it seems we've got
a rat in the store.

09:28.017 --> 09:30.485
I'm not mad. I'm not upset.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.688
I'll allow myself to
feel those things after

09:32.722 --> 09:35.700
I've hunted down and torn apart
whatever little weasel

09:36.185 --> 09:37.492
tattled on me to Jeff.

09:37.966 --> 09:39.333
Does anyone else hear that?

09:39.367 --> 09:41.726
It's like a high-pitched ringing.

09:52.586 --> 09:54.861
Hey, you, uh, wanted to see me?

09:54.863 --> 09:56.497
Yeah, please, have a seat.

09:56.532 --> 09:58.400
I was reviewing my files,

09:58.434 --> 10:00.435
and I noticed there was something wrong

10:00.469 --> 10:01.836
with your contract,

10:01.871 --> 10:03.905
so you need to sign a new one.

10:03.939 --> 10:05.440
Just standard boilerplate,

10:05.474 --> 10:07.242
you don't really need to read it.

10:07.275 --> 10:10.411
"The undersigned agrees
to work exclusively at Cloud 9

10:10.446 --> 10:11.846
for the next 30 years"?

10:13.348 --> 10:16.317
This is very flattering,
but I obviously can't sign that.

10:16.351 --> 10:20.187
Okay, well, that's, uh, disappointing.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.379
What is it that you want?
Is it... is it money?

10:22.390 --> 10:23.357
- No.
- 'Cause there's no money

10:23.391 --> 10:26.494
left in the budget,
but I could fire someone.

10:26.528 --> 10:27.995
- Glenn.
- Maybe Larry.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.206
You don't need to fire Larry.

10:29.209 --> 10:31.432
Oh, God, the poor man has lupus.

10:31.466 --> 10:32.566
It's not about...

10:32.601 --> 10:34.401
No, no, I'll do it. He's gone.

10:34.436 --> 10:37.404
Glenn, look, I'm not going
anywhere anytime soon,

10:37.439 --> 10:40.483
but I can't promise that
it's never gonna happen.

10:41.042 --> 10:42.676
Well, then, you're fired.

10:43.452 --> 10:44.345
What?

10:44.946 --> 10:47.047
Of course you're not fired. I love you!

10:47.082 --> 10:48.782
Okay, well, thank you.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.417
Do you love me?

10:50.452 --> 10:51.652
I'm sorry?

10:52.821 --> 10:55.356
Hey, we need to talk.

10:55.390 --> 10:57.086
I know, right?

10:58.117 --> 10:59.126
What's going on, girl?

10:59.160 --> 10:59.994
No, not a gay talk.

11:00.028 --> 11:01.390
We need to talk about who the snitch is.

11:01.391 --> 11:03.424
Now, it had to be somebody
in that room, but who?

11:03.929 --> 11:05.143
Okay, it couldn't have been Ramona,

11:05.143 --> 11:06.811
her husband doesn't let her
talk to other men.

11:06.845 --> 11:08.646
Wasn't Tim, his jaw's still wired shut,

11:08.680 --> 11:10.050
after talking to Ramona.

11:10.184 --> 11:11.649
I know it wasn't me.

11:11.683 --> 11:13.213
So that just leaves

11:13.885 --> 11:17.521
Justine, Elias, Sandra, you, uh...

11:17.556 --> 11:19.890
What?

11:19.925 --> 11:22.660
You know how I hate to gossip,
but I was out back last week,

11:22.694 --> 11:26.102
and I saw Jeff
making out with... Sandra.

11:27.432 --> 11:28.024
Sandra?

11:28.329 --> 11:31.202
Yeah, man on woman. It was disgusting.

11:31.236 --> 11:32.870
Oh, my God, it was Sandra.

11:32.904 --> 11:35.640
Oh, I am gonna drop-kick
that bitch back into whatever

11:35.674 --> 11:37.575
volcano she crawled out of...

11:37.609 --> 11:39.543
Wait, um, wouldn't it be worse

11:39.610 --> 11:42.378
if we didn't even tell her that we know,

11:42.625 --> 11:43.591
just ice her out,

11:43.626 --> 11:46.007
never talk to her again
and don't tell her why?

11:46.695 --> 11:48.563
It's pretty much the meanest
thing you can do to someone.

11:48.597 --> 11:49.301
I don't know.

11:49.388 --> 11:52.014
I didn't have a single friend in
high school, and I loved it there.

11:52.037 --> 11:52.775
Yeah, but,

11:53.817 --> 11:55.985
Sandra's not as strong as you.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.139
- You're right.
- Yeah.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.918
She's the weakest person I've ever met.

12:00.157 --> 12:01.253
So, uh,

12:02.059 --> 12:05.695
just had a really weird
convo with Glenn.

12:05.729 --> 12:09.632
Look, um, I don't have
a crystal ball, okay?

12:09.666 --> 12:13.169
I...I don't... I don't know
what's gonna happen in life,

12:13.203 --> 12:14.851
but I know one thing,

12:14.851 --> 12:16.518
and that is that we

12:16.552 --> 12:18.375
are always gonna be friends.

12:19.254 --> 12:22.824
Hmm, you say that, but I don't
know if I can believe you.

12:22.858 --> 12:24.659
- You can.
- No, I... I think that you'll

12:24.694 --> 12:26.395
probably just forget about us.

12:26.462 --> 12:29.231
No, Amy, I would never
forget about you guys.

12:29.302 --> 12:31.536
You guys are... are everything to me.

12:31.614 --> 12:33.501
You're just this little
flicker of sunlight

12:34.239 --> 12:36.504
that brightened our lives
for a short while.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.905
And now you must take that light

12:37.940 --> 12:39.675
to someone else, but it's okay because

12:39.709 --> 12:42.244
a little piece of your
magic lives inside

12:42.278 --> 12:43.745
each and every one of us.

12:44.138 --> 12:44.638
Okay.

12:44.738 --> 12:45.682
Be free.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.381
Forget I said anything.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.917
No, wait, don't go, please.

12:49.952 --> 12:52.454
Who's gonna force me to try tahini?

13:17.979 --> 13:19.880
Oh, whatcha got there, Eugene?

13:19.915 --> 13:21.415
You would not believe

13:21.451 --> 13:23.385
the amount of stuff
that gets misstocked here.

13:23.419 --> 13:25.045
Baby food in the barbeque.

13:25.077 --> 13:26.988
I found shampoo in jeans.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.457
I mean, who would do that?

13:28.771 --> 13:30.705
I don't know, probably some jerk

13:30.726 --> 13:32.623
or desperate mom or whatever.

13:32.624 --> 13:35.659
Yeah, well, I worked really
hard rounding it all up.

13:35.709 --> 13:38.344
I stayed two hours past
my shift, but I still...

13:38.362 --> 13:40.296
I'm all out of trophies, Eugene.

13:41.732 --> 13:42.766
That's okay.

13:42.801 --> 13:46.737
♪ Life is fine at Cloud 9 ♪

13:46.772 --> 13:48.739
♪ Life is great...♪ Hello, sir!

13:48.774 --> 13:50.508
♪ Work starts at eight ♪

13:50.541 --> 13:52.742
Two wolves I couldn't
do it, but one wolf...

13:52.777 --> 13:54.609
- Hey, guys.
- I could take it.

13:56.781 --> 13:59.357
Did anyone watch
"Vampire Diaries" last night?

13:59.785 --> 14:01.452
Damien's really gotten out of control.

14:01.485 --> 14:02.924
You stupid slut!

14:03.206 --> 14:03.721
Dina...

14:03.754 --> 14:05.967
- I can't hold it in any longer.
- What's happening?

14:06.006 --> 14:08.391
Sandra is having an affair with Jeff.

14:08.433 --> 14:09.332
- No.
- Oh!

14:09.360 --> 14:11.111
Don't you deny it! You were seen kissing

14:11.115 --> 14:12.081
on the loading dock.

14:12.088 --> 14:15.090
Ooh, Sandra, Sandra, Sandra!

14:15.124 --> 14:16.858
That's crazy, boo!

14:16.891 --> 14:18.993
I didn't know you had it in you.

14:19.028 --> 14:20.143
Dish, girl.

14:20.261 --> 14:21.819
I don't think we need
to be talking about that.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.478
Oh, I got questions,
like, when did it start?

14:32.026 --> 14:33.236
About two weeks ago.

14:34.894 --> 14:36.385
He pulled me into his Kia,

14:36.420 --> 14:40.056
and he said to me,
"Sandra take out your taters."

14:42.131 --> 14:42.992
And I did.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.162
And I put them in his face.

14:46.195 --> 14:48.663
Ooh, yeah!

14:53.347 --> 14:55.203
Hey, sorry about before.

14:55.238 --> 14:56.204
Oh, that's fine.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.815
I can take a little ribbing.

14:57.987 --> 15:00.676
Yeah, it went on for a really long time.

15:00.754 --> 15:01.813
Elias jumped in on it.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.195
He does a really good impression of you.

15:04.211 --> 15:06.772
It's like "Greetings, gentlemen."

15:06.975 --> 15:07.718
I can't do it.

15:07.719 --> 15:09.218
Look, uh, I just

15:09.254 --> 15:11.121
don't want you to think
that I got one foot

15:11.156 --> 15:12.122
out the door, okay?

15:12.157 --> 15:13.857
I...I'm here,

15:13.892 --> 15:15.960
just like everybody else.

15:15.994 --> 15:17.127
Mm...

15:17.162 --> 15:19.957
not just like everybody else.

15:20.498 --> 15:22.800
I mean, you can leave if you want.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.234
But I'm not.

15:24.269 --> 15:25.235
But you can.

15:25.270 --> 15:27.805
- But I'm not.
- But you can,

15:27.839 --> 15:30.541
and that's the difference
between being stranded

15:30.575 --> 15:31.809
on a desert island

15:31.843 --> 15:34.478
or going on a nice tropical vacation.

15:34.512 --> 15:35.600
You wanna think that, fine.

15:35.679 --> 15:37.881
I happen to think it's exactly the same.

15:37.916 --> 15:38.449
Okay.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.885
I mean, if you want me to cancel
my deferment, just say the word.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.521
Yeah, okay.

15:44.556 --> 15:45.990
- Cancel it.
- What?

15:46.024 --> 15:49.288
If you think there's honestly
no difference, cancel it.

15:49.928 --> 15:51.228
Okay, great, yeah.

15:51.262 --> 15:52.830
I will, I'll do it...
I'll do it tonight.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.298
No time like the present.

15:54.772 --> 15:56.740
Okay. I'll do it now.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.069
- Great.
- It makes no difference to me.

15:59.104 --> 16:02.106
I mean, if you need this,
then sure, let's, uh...

16:02.140 --> 16:03.841
I'm just gonna find the number.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.710
It's in an email so I gotta
search for it for...

16:06.745 --> 16:08.112
just hang on one second.

16:08.146 --> 16:10.014
I keep meaning to update the new OS.

16:10.048 --> 16:11.181
You know what? I'm gonna just...

16:11.216 --> 16:12.249
I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna do that

16:12.283 --> 16:13.150
right now, real quickly.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.688
Ugh, "estimated wait time four hours"?

16:16.721 --> 16:18.856
Hey, it's okay.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.191
It's... it's not me. It's the Wi-Fi.

16:21.226 --> 16:23.667
This is probably a
router placement issue.

16:25.229 --> 16:28.007
Jeff and I have these cute
nicknames for each other.

16:28.007 --> 16:29.523
He calls me "Deliciousness."

16:29.666 --> 16:30.733
Ooh.

16:30.734 --> 16:32.168
And I call him Mr. Man.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.811
Yeah, let's not forget she
was blabbing to Jeff about us.

16:36.838 --> 16:37.829
Ain't nobody care about that.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.691
Yeah, I'm just morbidly
intrigued at this point.

16:40.762 --> 16:42.429
Do you have sex in his hotel?

16:42.464 --> 16:44.598
Oh, yeah, all the time.

16:44.633 --> 16:46.167
Is there a coffee machine in there?

16:46.201 --> 16:47.768
Yep, one of those pod ones.

16:47.803 --> 16:49.270
Do they have decaf?

16:49.304 --> 16:50.604
- I think so.
- Ooh.

16:50.639 --> 16:51.098
Yes!

16:52.092 --> 16:53.908
And you guys will keep
this a secret, right?

16:53.942 --> 16:54.909
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

16:54.943 --> 16:56.844
we got you, Deliciousness.

16:59.548 --> 17:01.615
Amy to Glenn's office, please.

17:01.650 --> 17:05.152
Amy, report to Glenn's office, please.

17:06.688 --> 17:08.915
So we just call each other
into Glenn's office now?

17:08.938 --> 17:11.237
And that registration
is under "Jonah Simms"?

17:11.237 --> 17:13.738
Yes, S-I-M-M-S.

17:13.772 --> 17:15.362
Okay, let me pull up your records.

17:15.425 --> 17:16.082
Thank you.

17:16.116 --> 17:16.949
What are you doing?

17:16.976 --> 17:19.327
If you think some college deferral

17:19.328 --> 17:20.843
that I'm never even gonna use

17:20.844 --> 17:22.444
makes us so different, I don't want it.

17:22.478 --> 17:24.181
I was just trying to prove a point.

17:24.182 --> 17:25.147
- Hang up.
- No.

17:25.184 --> 17:26.617
- Hang up.
- No. No.

17:26.652 --> 17:28.619
- No, no, you.
- Cut it out.

17:28.654 --> 17:31.189
- God, your arms are very strong.
- I know.

17:31.223 --> 17:33.624
- Unusually strong.
- Okay, look, fine,

17:33.659 --> 17:35.293
we're in the exact same
position, all right?

17:35.327 --> 17:37.295
Just hang up, don't do
something you're gonna regret.

17:37.845 --> 17:38.481
Are you sure?

17:38.481 --> 17:39.176
Yes.

17:39.209 --> 17:40.509
Mr. Simms?

17:40.551 --> 17:42.685
Uh, hey, uh, yeah, you know what?

17:42.712 --> 17:43.779
I'm... I think I'm actually gonna...

17:43.814 --> 17:45.372
It turns out your registration lapsed

17:45.372 --> 17:47.883
a month ago, so you
don't have to worry about it.

17:47.918 --> 17:49.752
Um, what?

17:49.786 --> 17:51.687
That's... no, that's, mm-mm.

17:51.721 --> 17:53.089
That's a mistake.
I, uh, I believe I have

17:53.123 --> 17:54.590
a two-year deferral.

17:54.624 --> 17:56.692
Yes, two years from your
initial enrollment,

17:56.726 --> 17:57.893
not from when you left school,

17:57.928 --> 17:59.028
unless you apply to extend it...

17:59.062 --> 18:00.160
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,

18:00.162 --> 18:01.162
let's just go ahead and do that.

18:01.197 --> 18:03.959
Well, you would've had to apply
while you were still registered.

18:03.959 --> 18:05.093
Right. Right, right, right,
right, right, right.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.594
Listen, uh, how would I go about

18:07.628 --> 18:09.096
re-registering so that I could apply

18:09.130 --> 18:10.697
to extend the deferral?

18:10.731 --> 18:12.466
Uh, you don't.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.266
I mean, what's the difference?

18:13.301 --> 18:14.801
You were gonna cancel anyway, right?

18:14.836 --> 18:16.736
No, I was bluffing that I was cancelling

18:16.771 --> 18:18.038
to show you how alike we are.

18:18.072 --> 18:20.740
Uh, hey. Hi. What's your name?

18:20.775 --> 18:22.142
Vicky! Uh, hey, listen,

18:22.176 --> 18:25.145
we are going to find a solution, Vicky.

18:25.179 --> 18:26.913
I don't need to calm down, Vicky.

18:26.948 --> 18:28.782
I wasn't raising my voice.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.450
Well, now I am.

18:33.788 --> 18:34.921
Is all the clearance gone?

18:34.956 --> 18:37.624
Yes, Halo is officially over.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.467
What about the back? Would
you mind checking the back?

18:39.467 --> 18:41.935
Okay, fine, I'll check the back.

18:53.547 --> 18:56.049
Yes!

18:56.083 --> 18:59.052
I'm sorry, there's
nothing left in the back.

18:59.086 --> 19:01.021
Oh, thanks anyway.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.407
Psych!

19:04.392 --> 19:06.393
Somebody's actually
throwing their garbage away

19:06.427 --> 19:07.679
in the trash cans that we're selling,

19:07.679 --> 19:09.129
so could you check that
out in Home for me?

19:09.163 --> 19:10.130
I appreciate it.

19:10.164 --> 19:11.798
Thank you very much.

19:11.832 --> 19:12.899
- Sandra.
- Hey.

19:12.933 --> 19:15.702
There is a puddle in the
dressing room over there

19:15.736 --> 19:17.904
of I don't know what, actually.

19:17.938 --> 19:19.839
It's kind of viscous, and
it has a very strong odor.

19:19.874 --> 19:22.709
Um, do you think you might be
able to handle it for me?

19:26.881 --> 19:30.817
Oh, of course. I'll get my bucket.

19:30.851 --> 19:31.885
Boop.

19:36.891 --> 19:38.691
Oh, my God, it's so obvious.

19:38.726 --> 19:41.061
How have I never noticed this?

19:44.031 --> 19:45.565
Ugh.

19:50.471 --> 19:53.073
Hey, Iceman, I was looking for you.

19:53.107 --> 19:55.075
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

19:55.109 --> 19:57.043
Good to see you. Listen, I gotta bounce,

19:57.078 --> 19:59.079
but next time I'm in town,
I'm gonna ping you,

19:59.113 --> 20:00.237
and we go out for drinks.

20:00.239 --> 20:01.048
Uh, all right.

20:01.082 --> 20:02.105
Hey, I'll buy.

20:02.598 --> 20:03.417
I look forward to it.

20:03.451 --> 20:04.851
All right, great to see you.

20:04.885 --> 20:06.419
Hey, Rex Joshi.

20:06.454 --> 20:07.921
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, we met.

20:07.955 --> 20:08.680
Great.

20:10.658 --> 20:13.026
You really want to be that guy?

20:13.060 --> 20:14.727
Heated seats.

20:14.762 --> 20:16.129
The nice suit,

20:16.163 --> 20:17.597
fancy car,

20:17.631 --> 20:19.270
big smile.

20:21.102 --> 20:22.701
I was never gonna go back.

20:24.438 --> 20:26.039
I just...

20:28.776 --> 20:31.045
Welcome to the "no options" club.

20:32.113 --> 20:33.713
- But it's a cool club.
- Yeah?

20:33.747 --> 20:35.530
- Actually, I'm in it.
- Oh.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.150
Most of America's in it.

20:37.184 --> 20:38.651
We meet on Tuesdays.

20:38.686 --> 20:39.986
- Okay.
- I'll get you on the email.

20:40.020 --> 20:42.655
- Oh, great.
- Hey, Jonah.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.492
I heard about your business
school, I am so sorry.

20:45.526 --> 20:48.728
- Oh, uh, thanks.
- Yeah.

20:50.798 --> 20:52.445
Oh, all right.

20:53.667 --> 20:57.604
You will always have a place
here, till the day you die.

20:57.638 --> 20:59.606
You can die here.

21:06.814 --> 21:09.618
Oh, no, no, that wasn't about, um, you.

21:09.845 --> 21:13.414
I was just thinking of something
else that made me really happy.

21:15.047 --> 21:17.014
No, that way.
