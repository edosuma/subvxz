00:04.481 --> 00:06.718
Come on, you really have to go to bed.

00:06.738 --> 00:10.059
I'm not going to sleep
until Daddy says good night.

00:10.345 --> 00:13.238
Fine, I'll get him.

00:14.248 --> 00:17.077
Hi, sweetie.
I love you.

00:17.078 --> 00:18.832
Remember me?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.412
Kinda.

00:29.271 --> 00:33.050
It's, uh, it's almost 11:00.

00:33.070 --> 00:35.290
Is it?

00:35.310 --> 00:39.314
Yeah. How, uh... how much longer
you-you think it'll be?

00:39.399 --> 00:41.066
Till when?

00:41.101 --> 00:43.541
Uh, just, you know,
until we all go home?

00:43.561 --> 00:46.187
Mm... let's give it
another hour.

00:46.641 --> 00:48.259
And then we'll see where we are.

00:48.279 --> 00:49.877
Okay, well, uh...

00:49.897 --> 00:53.388
this design here is
definitely the room favorite.

00:53.408 --> 00:56.031
Yeah, you mentioned that.

00:59.252 --> 01:00.285
Okay.

01:04.686 --> 01:07.997
- What'd he say?
- Mm, no end in sight.

01:08.782 --> 01:11.035
What is wrong with him?

01:11.055 --> 01:13.965
He has no one to go home
to, that's the problem.

01:13.985 --> 01:15.950
Yeah, well, at least
I have my cats.

01:15.970 --> 01:18.714
Cats? Really? As in, plural?

01:18.925 --> 01:22.199
Yeah. I rescued another one.

01:22.219 --> 01:25.310
One more cat, and no man will
ever love you. You know that?

01:25.330 --> 01:27.541
Three cats. Die alone.

01:27.561 --> 01:29.055
Got it.

01:29.075 --> 01:31.756
I'm so lucky to have you as my mentor.

01:31.776 --> 01:33.947
- You should go home.
- No.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.936
Ypi stay, I stay.

01:36.235 --> 01:38.364
It's my job, boss.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.112
There's some chicken in the
fridge if you're hungry.

01:49.132 --> 01:53.045
Oh, uh...
Miranda and I had Greek.

01:53.065 --> 01:54.303
And pizza.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.047
Whoa.

01:56.067 --> 01:59.177
You spend more time with her
than you do with your family.

01:59.229 --> 02:01.429
Assistants are better
than wives.

02:01.515 --> 02:03.172
They do what you ask them to.

02:03.192 --> 02:06.017
- Well, then I should get one of those.
- Mm-hmm.

02:08.321 --> 02:10.130
Mom, Dad, oh, my gosh!

02:10.150 --> 02:12.595
Shh. What are you doing up?
Why are you awake?

02:12.615 --> 02:14.442
Harper's family is going to
Hawaii for spring break,

02:14.528 --> 02:16.821
and they invited me
to come with.

02:16.841 --> 02:18.577
Uh... how much
is that gonna cost?

02:18.597 --> 02:20.058
Oh, they're paying
for everything.

02:20.078 --> 02:21.290
- Can I go?
- Whoa.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.569
I got to... your dad and I
have to talk about that.

02:23.604 --> 02:25.737
Okay? Go back to bed.
We're gonna talk about it.

02:25.773 --> 02:27.182
- Right?
- Yeah.

02:27.202 --> 02:29.535
It's probably fine.

02:29.555 --> 02:30.917
We'll talk about it.
We have to talk about it.

02:30.937 --> 02:32.614
We have to... your father and I
have to talk about that.

02:32.634 --> 02:33.745
We have to talk about it.

02:33.781 --> 02:36.748
Shouldn't the first time that
she goes to Hawaii be with us?

02:36.784 --> 02:38.500
When are we gonna go to Hawaii?

02:38.586 --> 02:40.619
I wish I knew.

02:41.351 --> 02:44.567
Well, maybe we can take
our own family vacation over spring break.

02:44.587 --> 02:47.626
- I'll never get those days off.
- You could ask.

02:47.711 --> 02:50.462
Why don't we
just let her go?

02:50.514 --> 02:52.216
Don't you see what this is?

02:52.236 --> 02:54.340
- What?
- It's the beginning of the end.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.768
This is when she starts to care
more about her friends

02:56.804 --> 02:58.727
than spending time
with any of us.

02:58.747 --> 03:00.290
That's normal.

03:00.310 --> 03:03.442
Well, I'm not ready for it.

03:04.634 --> 03:05.811
I don't know what
she wants from me.

03:05.896 --> 03:08.187
You know?
Before, I didn't work enough,

03:08.207 --> 03:09.615
and now I work too much.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.483
It's like... ugh.

03:11.569 --> 03:13.402
You know, most men who
abandon their families

03:13.487 --> 03:14.653
start new ones.

03:14.705 --> 03:16.655
- I wasn't considering that.
- Oh.

03:16.707 --> 03:19.408
I fantasize about
abandoning Cindy all the time.

03:19.493 --> 03:20.576
But then what?

03:20.661 --> 03:21.743
Another Cindy.

03:21.829 --> 03:23.412
Abandon that Cindy.

03:23.497 --> 03:24.580
Then what?

03:24.665 --> 03:26.119
Another Cindy.

03:27.501 --> 03:29.418
I have a type.

03:29.438 --> 03:33.207
Yeah, well, my Cindy wants me to go
away with the family for spring break.

03:33.227 --> 03:35.674
Oh, so your wife
wants you to go away with your kids.

03:35.726 --> 03:36.842
You're right, she's a monster.

03:36.894 --> 03:39.215
No, it's Gil.

03:39.235 --> 03:41.680
I don't want to have to ask
that Asperger shithead

03:41.765 --> 03:43.649
for permission to hang out
with my family.

03:43.684 --> 03:44.816
That's humiliating.

03:44.852 --> 03:46.685
He's like talking to a robot.

03:46.737 --> 03:47.853
Exactly.

03:47.938 --> 03:49.688
Yeah, I'm not asking him.

03:49.773 --> 03:52.060
What are you gonna say to Lina?

03:52.384 --> 03:54.612
Then I forgot.

03:54.632 --> 03:57.027
It's a good strategy.

03:57.587 --> 03:59.691
What happened to group hang?

04:00.189 --> 04:01.833
It used to be so good
for vacations,

04:01.869 --> 04:05.183
and now it's just all tattoo
and laser hair removal.

04:05.469 --> 04:08.507
Yeah. It's crazy.

04:09.117 --> 04:10.759
You're not even listening.

04:10.844 --> 04:12.761
Sorry. I-I'm texting with AJ.

04:12.846 --> 04:15.764
- Ooh, that's still happening?
- Mm-hmm.

04:15.849 --> 04:17.766
I never met anybody like him.

04:17.851 --> 04:20.385
Most people haven't.

04:20.471 --> 04:21.687
Anyway, sorry.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.242
You were talking about
a cheap vacation.

04:24.262 --> 04:26.525
Yeah. Do you have any ideas?

04:26.560 --> 04:28.083
Um...

04:28.979 --> 04:29.645
Oh.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.563
You know, um, one of the moms

04:31.615 --> 04:34.616
in Maya's class
has a condo in Carpinteria.

04:34.702 --> 04:36.485
It's, like, a walk
from the beach.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.325
Carpinteria.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.705
Yeah.

04:39.740 --> 04:43.408
- I could work that a little.
- Yeah, work it.

04:44.407 --> 04:45.877
Hi. Alice, right?

04:45.913 --> 04:47.629
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Lina.

04:47.715 --> 04:49.464
I'm Maya's mom. Oh, yeah.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.632
Yeah. You teach here, right?

04:50.718 --> 04:52.751
Substitute. I substitute teach,

04:52.803 --> 04:54.886
so I don't really teach.

04:54.922 --> 04:57.506
But I still need a vacation.

04:57.591 --> 04:59.508
- Great.
- Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

04:59.593 --> 05:00.676
Hi, Jane.

05:00.761 --> 05:02.594
Hi. Jane, don't be rude.

05:02.646 --> 05:05.580
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's fine.

05:05.903 --> 05:09.176
I'm just realizing
that we've never hung out.

05:09.337 --> 05:10.569
That's right.

05:10.604 --> 05:13.164
Should we get the girls
together?

05:13.184 --> 05:16.109
Jane's always asking
for playdates.

05:19.165 --> 05:21.613
No, no, no.
That girl has problems.

05:21.665 --> 05:23.749
- Everyone has problems.
- Hers are worse.

05:23.784 --> 05:26.699
I need you to go
on this playdate.

05:27.454 --> 05:28.704
Do you know how many shitty moms

05:28.789 --> 05:31.242
I've had to hang out with
because of you?

05:36.180 --> 05:38.558
What if I told you that Daddy
and I were planning

05:38.578 --> 05:41.413
a family vacation of our own
over spring break?

05:41.433 --> 05:42.325
Where would we go?

05:42.345 --> 05:44.877
Well, we might go
to Carpinteria.

05:44.897 --> 05:49.189
Fancy condo, right on the beach.

05:49.274 --> 05:52.492
It all depends on Maya,
though, doesn't it?

05:52.774 --> 05:54.800
Lina,
why would you say that?

05:54.820 --> 05:58.111
You can't promise them things
that I haven't agreed to.

05:58.131 --> 06:01.540
Yeah, but now I'm gonna be
the one that lets them down.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.249
I realize we need time together,
but we also need to eat.

06:05.269 --> 06:07.408
Yes, fine, I will ask him.

06:07.664 --> 06:09.108
Good-bye.

06:09.233 --> 06:10.294
Everything okay?

06:10.379 --> 06:11.628
Yeah, it's just my wife

06:11.714 --> 06:14.961
wants you to ask Gil for
those vacation days I need.

06:14.981 --> 06:17.994
Your wife wants me to do that?

06:18.504 --> 06:20.185
Come on, please?

06:20.546 --> 06:21.588
Help me out, here.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.132
I-I really don't think
it's that hard.

06:23.152 --> 06:25.497
I think you just have to,
like, act like he's a pal.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.489
I think he looks up to you.
Just hang out with him.

06:27.509 --> 06:30.681
- Ew. Really?
- Call him a... call him a bro.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.351
He'll like that. He'll be, like,
"Oh... we're friends."

06:38.407 --> 06:39.490
Hey, buddy.

06:39.575 --> 06:40.691
How you doing?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.359
Um, hey, what are you, uh,

06:42.445 --> 06:43.777
what are you doing tonight?

06:43.829 --> 06:45.662
It's a work night.
I'm not sure what you mean.

06:45.748 --> 06:47.448
Oh, I was just thinking...

06:47.500 --> 06:49.533
I don't know, maybe
we should, uh, go out.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.618
You know? Like, grab
a bite. Have some fun.

06:51.670 --> 06:55.339
Grab a bite? Hmm.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.541
Hmm.

06:58.198 --> 06:59.626
Hmm.

07:02.406 --> 07:03.464
So, uh,

07:03.516 --> 07:05.632
do you...
do you come here often, or...

07:05.684 --> 07:08.519
No. Between work and the gym,

07:08.539 --> 07:10.587
I don't really have time.

07:12.952 --> 07:14.943
Russ, can I ask you a question?

07:14.963 --> 07:16.643
it's personal.

07:16.729 --> 07:19.446
Uh, sure, man.

07:20.047 --> 07:21.532
Are you having sex
with your assistant?

07:21.617 --> 07:23.534
What? Excuse me?

07:23.554 --> 07:26.165
Your assistant. Are you
having sex with her?

07:26.688 --> 07:27.488
No.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.199
But you guys are always
laughing and joking around.

07:30.219 --> 07:32.493
- Yeah.
- Like... two people who do have sex.

07:32.545 --> 07:34.661
Yeah. That's...
'cause we're friends.

07:34.713 --> 07:36.401
That's... that's it.

07:38.032 --> 07:40.260
So you don't wanna have sex with her?

07:40.447 --> 07:42.426
Not really.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.293
You're lucky.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.036
You understand women.

07:46.629 --> 07:49.248
The rituals.
WantThe communication. her?

07:49.268 --> 07:51.937
Uh... I try.

07:51.957 --> 07:53.057
You know?

07:53.077 --> 07:56.517
I got a full house of 'em
at home, so...

07:56.569 --> 07:58.352
Which, uh, reminds me...

07:58.437 --> 08:00.354
can I ask you a favor? I...

08:00.406 --> 08:01.438
Please keep shooting.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.607
It's, uh... about my family.

08:03.627 --> 08:06.836
Evade! Evade!

08:07.521 --> 08:09.630
When I met you and I
told you that I was sober,

08:09.650 --> 08:12.630
that was not a put-on.
That was not a pose.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.858
That was a life choice
I had made

08:14.878 --> 08:17.156
that meant a lot to me.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.706
The chicken piccata
looks so good.

08:19.758 --> 08:21.458
I was definitely gonna get that.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.394
And then, a week later,

08:23.414 --> 08:27.353
I went into a dark place,
and I slipped again.

08:27.373 --> 08:28.549
I can relate.

08:28.601 --> 08:31.268
Um... a couple weeks ago,

08:31.353 --> 08:34.412
I found out that my ex
got his new girlfriend

08:34.432 --> 08:36.390
a... a boob job.

08:36.409 --> 08:37.201
Wow.

08:37.221 --> 08:40.277
So I drank a whole
bottle of wine that night.

08:40.361 --> 08:42.395
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

08:42.996 --> 08:44.558
How often does that happen?

08:44.578 --> 08:48.325
Oh, well, I think she just
got the one boob job.

08:48.499 --> 08:49.620
No, I meant the drinking.

08:49.705 --> 08:51.371
Do you want another
glass of wine?

08:51.407 --> 08:52.573
Um...

08:52.625 --> 08:54.291
Do you want one?

08:54.376 --> 08:56.710
Uh, yeah, I kind of do,
if that's okay.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.238
That's a very personal decision.

09:05.619 --> 09:07.175
Mmm.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.641
Hey, I just had a great idea.
What are you doing this weekend?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.426
I don't know.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.645
I do.

09:14.730 --> 09:16.597
Oh... all right.

09:16.649 --> 09:18.700
It's a surprise.

09:21.447 --> 09:23.520
Hey, did you get the dates?

09:23.900 --> 09:26.444
I tried. I really tried.

09:26.464 --> 09:28.025
Did you really?

09:28.045 --> 09:31.249
Yeah, I did, okay?
Don't do that.

09:31.269 --> 09:33.447
I just spent the whole
night playing video games

09:33.499 --> 09:35.749
with that weirdo, and he
still shut me down, okay?

09:35.784 --> 09:38.535
Well, are you gonna tell Ella,
or should I?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.293
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey.

09:46.345 --> 09:47.678
How are you?

09:47.763 --> 09:50.347
I can't wait for our vacation.

09:50.432 --> 09:53.222
Oh, yeah, yeah. Our vacation.

09:53.242 --> 09:56.670
Yeah, um, I was thinking,
though, wouldn't...

09:56.690 --> 09:59.072
wouldn't you rather getting
to Hawaii with Harper?

09:59.092 --> 10:01.276
It sounds so much fun
it's beautiful there.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.312
Yeah, but when I told Harper
we were going on vacation,

10:04.332 --> 10:06.647
she invited Lily instead.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.150
Okay.

10:20.598 --> 10:22.219
Do I have to do this?

10:22.239 --> 10:26.649
Honey, here is a photo
of the condo in Carpenteria.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.522
It is right on the beach.

10:30.768 --> 10:32.236
Fine.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.651
Thank you.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.462
You're really taking one
for the team right now,

10:37.482 --> 10:39.752
and I appreciate it.

10:40.428 --> 10:42.379
You're my hero.

10:42.399 --> 10:44.333
This is fun.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.424
I know, right? It's very...

10:46.444 --> 10:47.825
- We should do this more often.
- Yeah, totally.

10:47.845 --> 10:50.477
I'm kind of surprised
that Gil let us leave early.

10:50.497 --> 10:53.654
Actually, Gil is joining us.

10:54.435 --> 10:55.624
Wait, really?

10:55.676 --> 10:57.834
- Yeah.
- Why?

10:58.058 --> 11:00.394
- Well, Gil is...
- Why?

11:00.414 --> 11:03.133
He's-he's
a really interesting guy.

11:03.153 --> 11:06.024
- Is he?
- And I may have told him

11:06.044 --> 11:08.470
that you wanted to hang out.

11:09.061 --> 11:11.327
That's...
Why would you tell him that?

11:11.347 --> 11:12.584
This could be good for us.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.713
- Us? Why would that be good for us?
- Yes.

11:14.733 --> 11:16.612
Because... Okay, think about it.

11:16.632 --> 11:19.164
If Gil becomes more comfortable

11:19.184 --> 11:21.081
with women, right,
then maybe he'll become

11:21.101 --> 11:22.438
more of, like, a normal guy

11:22.458 --> 11:25.237
and let us go
on vacations and stuff

11:25.257 --> 11:27.068
like normal human beings.

11:27.088 --> 11:30.068
- He'll treat his employees...
- Okay, so you want me to blow him

11:30.069 --> 11:31.313
- or something?
- No.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.787
No, I don't.
I just want you to, like,

11:32.807 --> 11:34.998
talk to him, you know,
and-and laugh at his jokes

11:35.018 --> 11:35.919
and make him feel comfortable.

11:35.939 --> 11:37.164
Okay, I thought
this was about work.

11:37.184 --> 11:38.832
I brought you my portfolio
to look at,

11:38.852 --> 11:40.898
and now I'm just, like...
I feel stupid or something.

11:40.918 --> 11:42.915
No. Now you can just
cut out the middleman, right?

11:42.935 --> 11:45.674
And you can just...
show 'em right to Gil.

11:45.965 --> 11:47.794
You pimped me out to the robot.

11:47.814 --> 11:49.818
Hey, dude.
You guys talking about robots?

11:49.838 --> 11:52.096
No, no, no. We... No.

11:52.116 --> 11:53.129
Oh, it's okay.

11:53.149 --> 11:55.567
I know that's what
everybody calls me.

11:55.825 --> 11:58.153
- I don't... No. I don't...
- No.

11:58.173 --> 12:01.523
Robots aren't so bad.

12:01.543 --> 12:04.452
Um... I-I have a Roomba.

12:04.472 --> 12:06.938
Very cool.
That is very cool.

12:06.958 --> 12:09.171
See, you guys have
a lot in common.

12:09.191 --> 12:10.623
That's awesome.

12:10.643 --> 12:12.649
Um... Oh, no.

12:12.669 --> 12:15.736
Oh, Lina just texted.
There's a family emergency.

12:15.756 --> 12:17.990
You know what, I got to go.
I'm so sorry. Um...

12:18.075 --> 12:19.525
- That's okay.
- I will see you at work.

12:19.545 --> 12:20.943
Um... Uh, uh, is everyone okay?

12:20.995 --> 12:23.779
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's just
Lina's got this thing here.

12:23.831 --> 12:26.699
- She has a thing? A thing?
- She's got a thing, and I...

12:26.784 --> 12:28.701
- Yeah, and I got to help her.
- Specifically...?

12:28.786 --> 12:30.682
It's just this thing
that I-I got to... I got to...

12:30.702 --> 12:32.788
I got to take care of.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.006
You know
you're a terrible person, right?

12:34.091 --> 12:35.494
- I owe you one.
- I trusted you.

12:35.514 --> 12:37.523
You're the best.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.975
Wow, this place is beautiful.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.693
Where's our room?

12:54.779 --> 12:57.646
We're in
the Sandpiper Conference Room.

12:57.698 --> 12:59.815
Are they out of regular rooms?

13:02.120 --> 13:03.652
What is this?

13:03.738 --> 13:05.154
Who are all these people?

13:06.718 --> 13:08.791
People who
care about you. People who came

13:08.826 --> 13:11.391
on short notice to help you
talk about your problem.

13:11.411 --> 13:13.116
Is that my gardener?

13:13.739 --> 13:16.081
I dialed the last ten
numbers on your phone

13:16.167 --> 13:17.833
so that we could talk to you.

13:17.918 --> 13:19.051
Excuse me.

13:19.136 --> 13:21.053
You rear-ended me last Thursday.

13:21.138 --> 13:23.672
I got to settle
the insurance claim.

13:23.758 --> 13:25.007
We hurt people when we're sick.

13:25.092 --> 13:26.809
Is that my neighbor?

13:26.844 --> 13:28.644
I hope so. She was standing
right outside

13:28.679 --> 13:30.312
- of your door, so...
- I really don't understand.

13:30.332 --> 13:33.682
- Like, who is that lady?
- That's your yoga teacher.

13:33.768 --> 13:37.069
- That's not my yoga teacher.
- I'm-I'm filling in for Heather.

13:38.076 --> 13:40.471
I know these
aren't your closest

13:40.491 --> 13:42.024
family and friends,

13:42.076 --> 13:44.337
but I did the best I could
on short notice.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.079
Hector, maybe you start.

13:51.422 --> 13:52.835
"Dear Miss Abby,

13:53.339 --> 13:54.036
"I hear you have

13:54.121 --> 13:56.839
"a drinking problem.
Sorry about the mean thoughts

13:56.874 --> 13:58.336
"I had for you.

13:58.356 --> 14:00.709
"And now I understand
why you don't tip.

14:00.795 --> 14:02.431
"It's because you're sick,

14:02.451 --> 14:04.219
sick with addiction."

14:08.790 --> 14:10.364
It feels good to
finally sit down.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.709
Oh, doesn't it?

14:12.729 --> 14:16.444
I always say that sitting is
like a vacation from standing.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.914
And don't we all need that?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.966
- Yeah.
- You know?

14:20.002 --> 14:21.718
- We do.
- Right.

14:21.993 --> 14:23.823
- Hi, Peach.
- Can we go home?

14:23.843 --> 14:26.006
No, not yet.

14:26.425 --> 14:29.414
- She keeps making me play robber.
- So?

14:29.737 --> 14:31.380
I always have to be the robber.

14:31.517 --> 14:33.459
So? That's great.
The villain's the best part.

14:33.479 --> 14:35.982
- I don't want the part.
- Go.

14:38.948 --> 14:41.021
So, teaching.

14:41.289 --> 14:42.939
Did you study education?

14:43.025 --> 14:44.858
You know, it's funny. I didn't.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.910
Um, I went to business school.

14:46.995 --> 14:48.368
Kind of stumbled upon teaching.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.214
I spend, you know,
all day now with kids.

14:51.234 --> 14:53.950
All day... all night,

14:54.036 --> 14:56.432
at home with my kids, so it's

14:56.452 --> 15:00.040
- kind of nonstop. Just kids, kids, kids.
- I do that, too.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.042
You're a psychologist, right?

15:02.127 --> 15:04.928
- Child psychologist.
- Oh, shit. So you're

15:05.013 --> 15:06.713
- in the same boat.
- Yeah.

15:07.849 --> 15:09.182
- Get off of me!
- Oh, my God.

15:09.217 --> 15:11.885
- Jane, what are you doing?! Jane!
- Get off of me.

15:11.937 --> 15:13.053
Mom, she robbed me!

15:13.105 --> 15:15.055
Maya, Maya, Maya.
Stop it right now.

15:15.107 --> 15:16.773
Nobody steals from me!

15:16.858 --> 15:18.966
Oh, sweetie.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.945
I'm so sorry. Is she okay?

15:22.030 --> 15:25.115
- Oh...
- Mommy.

15:25.376 --> 15:29.182
So, I hear you have a condo
on the beach?

15:31.846 --> 15:33.156
I'm sorry. It's just

15:33.241 --> 15:35.909
when you said you drank a
whole bottle of wine...

15:35.961 --> 15:38.488
I was trying
to connect with you.

15:38.886 --> 15:41.543
But then you drank
three glasses at dinner.

15:41.563 --> 15:43.083
Three glasses? You know,

15:43.168 --> 15:45.085
sometimes I drink,
sometimes I don't.

15:45.170 --> 15:47.087
I'm not an addict.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.756
I'm starting to figure that out.
I just got excited

15:49.808 --> 15:52.722
because I thought we had
something in common. My bad.

15:59.935 --> 16:03.019
If you don't want
to see me again, I get it.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.897
No one's ever thrown me
an intervention before.

16:12.453 --> 16:14.009
So you liked it?

16:14.029 --> 16:16.150
No, I didn't.

16:24.472 --> 16:26.339
But I like you.

16:31.754 --> 16:33.609
You do?

16:40.194 --> 16:41.769
Hey.

16:41.789 --> 16:43.727
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

16:43.955 --> 16:45.574
It was good.

16:46.198 --> 16:47.947
- Do you hate me?
- No.

16:47.983 --> 16:50.914
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:52.691 --> 16:54.160
What happened?

16:54.180 --> 16:57.327
Mm, we just, like, got a few drinks.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.825
And?

16:58.877 --> 17:00.827
So, like, you know,

17:00.879 --> 17:03.163
I get out my portfolio to show him.
And he's like, Uh-huh.

17:03.215 --> 17:06.006
"Should we take this
to my place?"

17:06.026 --> 17:06.832
Oh, no.

17:06.852 --> 17:09.627
So I was like, "Screw it."
I went.

17:09.647 --> 17:10.355
You went?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.755
We were there maybe, like, 15 minutes,

17:11.839 --> 17:15.280
Uh-huh. and he...

17:15.300 --> 17:17.727
asks if he could touch himself.

17:17.813 --> 17:20.316
Oh, Miranda, I'm so sorry.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.098
So I said, "Sure."

17:24.030 --> 17:25.819
- You did?
- I don't know. I don't know.

17:25.854 --> 17:27.069
It was, like, so direct.

17:27.155 --> 17:28.847
I thought maybe
it would be interesting,

17:28.940 --> 17:30.849
like, in a story or something.

17:30.942 --> 17:33.026
And, like...

17:33.111 --> 17:36.029
I'm sitting there. He gets up,
he goes to the bathroom

17:36.081 --> 17:39.117
for, like, lotion, I'm assuming,
and comes back

17:39.137 --> 17:41.076
five minutes later.

17:41.415 --> 17:44.829
And he says he's finished

17:44.865 --> 17:46.690
and now we can make milk shakes.

17:46.710 --> 17:50.014
- Wow. Wow.
- Yeah.

17:50.034 --> 17:52.704
- Wow. Okay.
- Oh, God.

17:52.756 --> 17:55.707
Okay. Uh... wow.

17:55.759 --> 17:58.042
All right, uh, we got to...

17:58.095 --> 18:00.095
we can't talk about this
at the office.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.098
No. We just can't.
This would be bad for me.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.800
Hey. Heard about the
masturbating robot.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.969
Awesome.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.771
Eh, eh, beep, boop,

18:09.856 --> 18:11.022
beep, boop, beep,
boop, beep, Oh...

18:11.057 --> 18:12.891
boop, beep, beep, boop.

18:12.976 --> 18:14.859
I might have told
a couple people.

18:14.895 --> 18:18.863
Beep, boop,
beep, boop, beep, boop.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.868
Isn't it beautiful here?

18:23.904 --> 18:26.260
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

18:26.546 --> 18:29.546
Can someone turn me
a little away from the sun?

18:30.418 --> 18:31.942
Say hey to daddy.

18:31.962 --> 18:34.027
- Hey, daddy.
- Hey, daddy.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.964
Guys, do you mind
just trying to, like,

18:36.049 --> 18:38.082
sort of turn me to the right?

18:38.135 --> 18:42.102
I just want to see, there's a...
girl in a bikini over there.
