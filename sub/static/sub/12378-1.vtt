00:34.200 --> 00:37.590
I'm thinking about
getting a penis implant.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.359
Get the fuck out of here.

00:40.480 --> 00:46.635
No, I'm fucking serious.
They've got these do-it-yourself implants, now.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.794
You do most of it yourself,
but somebody's got to give you a hand.

00:52.920 --> 00:57.152
What the fuck are you looking
at me for? I'm not touching your dick!

00:58.240 --> 01:01.437
Hey Cookie, what about you?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.516
Come on, Stretch.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.078
Cookie doesn't want to hear
that shit about your dick. Do you, baby?

01:11.880 --> 01:13.916
Cookie?

01:15.880 --> 01:17.791
Cookie?

01:19.800 --> 01:22.678
Oh, shit! Cookie!

01:22.800 --> 01:25.837
Don't do this to me, baby. Come on! Cookie!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.753
Give me a fucking hand, would you?

01:29.880 --> 01:32.952
- Fuck!
- Shit!

01:34.640 --> 01:36.437
Fuck, fuck!

01:36.560 --> 01:38.516
I knew this would fucking happen!

01:38.640 --> 01:41.518
Just give me a fucking hand, man.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.916
Oh, shit!

01:45.360 --> 01:50.832
...nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

01:50.960 --> 01:55.238
three, two, one... Happy New Year.!

02:00.960 --> 02:04.509
Cookie. Baby.

02:04.640 --> 02:11.398
- I don't believe this!
- This is really fucking bad!

02:15.640 --> 02:19.633
- Give me a fucking hand!
- Will you quit yelling?

02:20.640 --> 02:24.599
Turn on the cold water,
we've got to put her in the tub.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.437
What a great
New Year's celebration...

02:38.200 --> 02:42.955
What a way to start
the new year. Happy fucking New Year!

02:43.080 --> 02:45.435
Can you give me a hand?

02:49.200 --> 02:52.317
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

02:55.120 --> 02:57.918
Come on! Keep talking!

02:58.040 --> 03:00.918
You're doing alright, there.
I don't fucking believe it!

03:01.040 --> 03:03.554
I knew this shit was going to happen.
I fucking knew it!

03:03.680 --> 03:05.272
Shut the fuck up!

03:05.400 --> 03:08.676
Cookie, Cookie!

03:08.800 --> 03:12.475
Cookie... Shit!

03:12.600 --> 03:15.672
- We've got to get her to hospital
- Let's get her out of here.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.831
Taxi!

03:43.600 --> 03:44.874
- Hey!
- Fuck!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.353
Fuck you!

03:53.600 --> 03:55.989
Hey, come on!

04:01.280 --> 04:03.840
Motherfucker!

04:07.000 --> 04:09.434
- Who are you calling?
- Ambulance.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.757
Hello, how mu...

04:12.880 --> 04:15.269
He put me on hold! I can't believe it!

04:15.400 --> 04:18.119
Cookie's fucking dying and he put me on hold!

04:18.240 --> 04:19.992
Have him call back.

04:20.120 --> 04:25.194
Hello? A woman's been shot,
a white woman, OK?

04:25.320 --> 04:31.350
There's black people here shooting,
burning cars and talking about revolution.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.517
You better send some motherfuckers out here!

04:38.040 --> 04:40.474
They're on their way.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.068
Don't worry, baby. They're coming.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.431
Happy New Year...

05:32.040 --> 05:34.474
Dress those wounds!

05:45.560 --> 05:47.073
May I help you?

05:47.200 --> 05:50.112
Yeah, my friend has had a New Year's Eve party

05:50.240 --> 05:53.789
and she had a little too much to drink.
She mixed it with some drugs.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.151
- Overdose, sir?
- Yeah.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.512
- Does she have insurance?
- I don't know.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.200
- Your name, sir?
- EzekielWhitmore.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.550
Fillthis out and bring it back.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.036
My friend's standing here in a coma.
We need to see a doctor right away!

06:10.160 --> 06:12.799
Fillthis out and bring it back.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.990
It's alright, Cookie. OK. It's alright.
Everything's going to be OK.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.998
We're at the hospital
Everything's going to be OK.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.316
- Cn I see a doctor now, please?
- Just a minute, sir.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.637
I need a Social Security number
and a Medicaid number, if she has one.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.513
I'm assuming she does
since you put ''yes'' in this box.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.473
A photo ID and the address of her next of kin.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.354
My fucking lady's going to die here.
We need a fucking doctor right now!

06:56.480 --> 06:59.199
If I knew the numbers,
I would've written them down!

06:59.320 --> 07:03.279
- I need a fucking doctor!
- You don't use that language with me.

07:03.400 --> 07:08.394
You don't know me. Where did you get off
talking to me like to some tramp?

07:08.520 --> 07:12.229
Nobody talks to me like that
when I'm trying to do my job,

07:12.360 --> 07:14.828
because you know what? I'd let the bitch die!

07:14.960 --> 07:18.555
- What is wrong, Gloria?
- That man has lost his mind.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.477
Doc, the girl just OD'd
and hasn't said a word in an hour.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.398
I'm as scared as fuck that she's going to die.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.317
Gurney!

09:00.160 --> 09:01.991
Get off me! Get off!

09:02.120 --> 09:04.350
Let me go!

09:04.480 --> 09:06.311
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

09:06.440 --> 09:09.432
Shut the fuck up!

09:09.560 --> 09:12.074
I'll killyou! Fuck you!

09:14.480 --> 09:18.029
First you fuck for an hour,
screaming. Then you make allthis noise.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.358
What's the matter, daddy?
You could've joined us.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.752
You know I can't get it up in a crowd, baby.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.074
Did you read my new poem?
I'm doing it tonight.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.591
No, not yet.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.036
What the fuck are you watching?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.833
The men had their sex changed,
but now they're lesbian.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.632
What?

09:42.760 --> 09:47.311
The men had their sex changed,
but now they're lesbian.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.309
Wait a minute. A man becomes a woman, yeah?

09:52.440 --> 09:54.829
But he doesn't do it
to sleep with a man as a woman.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.554
He does it to sleep with a woman as a woman.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.873
Right.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.551
So he cuts off his dick so he can sleep
with a woman without the equipment.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.754
Right.

10:06.880 --> 10:12.716
No. He could have saved a lot of money
giving women head and keeping his dick.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.876
But then he wouldn't have been a woman.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.673
Oh, right. Excuse me, I forgot that part.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.590
The baby's fatheris also
yourbaby's cousin. That's notright.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.871
There are some
crazy motherfuckers in this world.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.116
Where's my veggieburger?

10:28.240 --> 10:31.516
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.315
Was that a veggieburger?
The shit tastes just like meat.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.034
You greedy bastard. You ate it!

10:40.400 --> 10:43.198
Which one of you fucks ate my veggieburger?

10:46.960 --> 10:50.236
That shit's not funny! I am the vegetarian.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.920
Buy your own fucking food.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.190
Cookie, you are so full of shit.

10:55.320 --> 10:59.871
Don't you just love people who smoke
three packs a day and say, ''I'm a vegetarian''.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.993
Fuck that. You can talk to me about health
when you stop smoking, OK?

11:04.120 --> 11:09.035
Oh, yeah? You talk to me about smoking
when you stop doing blow, arsehole.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.317
I win.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.632
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.435
Just call me Spoon.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.471
Stretch.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.833
- Stretch...
- Alexander Rowlam.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.951
Most people call me ''Stretch''.

11:38.440 --> 11:43.878
It's stilltoo early to tell,
but, in all honesty, she may not make it.

11:44.720 --> 11:48.190
We're doing all we can.
We just have to wait and see.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.711
Can we see her?

11:52.680 --> 11:54.591
I'm sorry.

11:54.720 --> 11:59.271
Come on with the ''sorry''-shit, Doc!
Can we see her?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.549
It's not making sense.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.638
It's not making any kind of sense.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.436
Look at her. What if she fucking dies?

12:41.400 --> 12:45.075
Huh? What if she fucking dies?

12:49.960 --> 12:54.909
All the things we talked about.
The things we wanted to do...

12:56.640 --> 12:59.632
We could even help some people.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.559
And she fucking dies getting high.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.714
I don't want to go out like that, man.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.751
No.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.436
Ever felt that your luck's running out, man?

13:19.560 --> 13:21.357
I mean...

13:24.040 --> 13:27.749
Lately I've been feeling
like my luck's been running out.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.872
Maybe Cookie OD'ing is some kind of sign.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.872
I don't know. You know what I'm saying?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.116
I'm kicking.

13:52.560 --> 13:57.076
I'm kicking. Are you going to help me?

13:58.320 --> 14:00.709
Get the fuck out of here.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.037
I'm serious. I mean...

14:04.160 --> 14:06.674
We don't even get high off the shit any more.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.678
We just do it to keep from getting sick.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.988
That shit ain't fun no more.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.193
Gentlemen. I'm afraid your time is up.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.273
- Let me think about it.
- What's there to think about?

14:26.400 --> 14:29.995
Come on, we just do it. Make it
our New Year's resolution this year.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.954
Stretch, I'm serious. I'm kicking
and I want you to do it with me.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.472
Let me think about it.

14:48.920 --> 14:54.438
OK. Brand-new 1,400-dollar video camera,
remarkably well-priced.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.390
- 500 dollars, you can't beat that.
- 500 dollars?

14:59.520 --> 15:02.398
- OK, 400.
- Fuck off, I'll give you 200.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.715
- 200?
- OK, 100.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.638
- 100?
- Or should I run over your foot?

15:07.760 --> 15:11.594
Alright. But you know
this is fucked-up, though?

15:13.720 --> 15:16.678
All I've got is 83 and change.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.678
You're giving me 83 dollars for
a 1,400-dollar camera? You're killing me here!

15:25.280 --> 15:28.397
Where's the change? Give me the change.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.148
Fucking junkie.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.431
Fuck you, your mama's a junkie.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.357
Fuck!

16:08.680 --> 16:10.989
What did you say? My mama's a what?

16:11.120 --> 16:13.190
You said some shit about my mama?

16:16.440 --> 16:18.431
I said, ''Your mama's a junkie, bitch!''

16:19.880 --> 16:23.031
- I kicked the motherfucker.
- Yeah.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.833
I knocked the motherfucker out.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.839
I didn't need you to hit the motherfucker.
I'd have kicked his punk ass.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.598
Know what I'm ''sizaying''?

16:31.720 --> 16:36.316
- Let go with that Pig Latin shit.
- It's Bop.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.908
- Bop?
- Yeah, from bebop.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.591
Take the first letter and put ''iz'' behind it.
Then you add the rest of the word.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.908
Like ''saying'' will be ''sizaying''.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.676
''Cool'' will be ''cizool''.
You know what I'm ''sizaying''?

16:51.800 --> 16:55.509
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.918
Yeah, that's just cool
I'm writing some of that bop stuff.

17:00.040 --> 17:04.113
Yeah, Cee-Cee's playing
at The Spotnext week.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.311
- Why don't you come check it out?
- What night are you playing?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.510
Wednesday and Thursday.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.438
- I'll be there.
- Yeah, I'm there.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.676
Why aren't you happy to fuck off
right now? Come on, I've got shit to do.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.078
Yeah, go on and get your
little crazy ass out of here, man.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.396
I've been listening to you
talking shit for an hour.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.114
- I've got other customers coming.
- Fuck you!

17:28.160 --> 17:30.754
I've spent my money, I'll sit all day, nigger.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.878
See, I told you. This motherfucker is crazy.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.397
Fucking real crazy.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.955
What the fuck did you call me?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.799
''Nigger.''

18:02.440 --> 18:07.070
Come on, man. This motherfucker
thinks he is black as shit.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.316
Crazy-ass motherfucker.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.112
Yeah.

18:21.320 --> 18:27.031
You better go and get this motherfucker
out of my face before I shoot him.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.068
Come on, Stretch.
Why am I always waiting for you?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.760
For once in your life can you just come on?

18:40.880 --> 18:46.159
I'm coming. I don't know why you're in
such a hurry. You ain't got shit to do.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.915
- See you Thursday.
- Cool

19:00.280 --> 19:03.829
You won't be seeing me for a while.
It's my last day getting high.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.395
- New Year's resolution.
- No shit.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.195
- Yeah.
- That's good, man. I'm real proud of you.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.352
Shit, I need to kick myself, man.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.473
Seems like I've been doing more dope
than I've been selling nowadays.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.956
- Yeah.
- What about you, nigger?

19:25.600 --> 19:27.397
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.795
I'll be pulling for you, my man.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.675
Yeah, pull on this.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.519
You've got to chill with that ''nigger''-shit, man.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.554
You're comfortable with me, but don't
call me ''nigger'' in front of black people.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.274
They'll ask why I let a honky call me ''nigger''.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.913
Term of fucking endearment.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.713
It'll be a term of you getting your ass kicked.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.674
You can't say that! ''Nigger''! You're not black!

19:51.880 --> 19:54.030
You're going to say that shit
to the wrong person,

19:54.160 --> 19:57.630
- and I swear to God I'll..
- Hey! Don't look up.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.269
That's the guy you hit in the head.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.870
Shit, those are definitely his plates!

20:11.560 --> 20:14.996
- Why don't you go back and kick his ass?
- Fuck you! You think I won't?

20:15.120 --> 20:17.759
Think I fucking won't?

20:17.960 --> 20:23.910
Hey! My friend here was extremely
disappointed with his purchase.

20:24.040 --> 20:28.079
He was under the impression
that batteries would be included.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.440
Shit! Come on!

20:41.920 --> 20:43.273
Let them go.

20:55.160 --> 20:59.358
That was close, way too fucking close.
Think we lost them?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.149
Yeah, we lost them.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.277
Shit, I blew my high!

21:08.480 --> 21:12.439
My last time getting high
and these motherfuckers blow it.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.356
Hi, I'm trying to check on the condition
of Ms Barbara Cook.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.799
I brought her in last night.
Actually, it was this morning.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.518
He could have fucking shot us!

21:32.520 --> 21:34.397
Yeah.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.518
OK, thanks.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.510
No change. Critical condition.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.952
I think you're right
about this ''luck running out''-shit.

21:51.080 --> 21:55.676
We're fucking broke. Cookie paid
the rent for the last three months.

21:57.640 --> 22:02.350
- Now this...
- Yeah. You're right.

22:09.640 --> 22:13.349
No, I think that if you do it in
the privacy of your own home, fine,

22:13.560 --> 22:17.997
but breast-feeding in public
is down right disgusting.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.157
This is Skip Woods taking your calls.

22:22.280 --> 22:27.991
When we return. Addicts - do we
really want to give them free needles.

22:28.120 --> 22:32.716
We'll be right back with
'America - Love it or get the hell out''.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.511
I hate that fucking guy.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.948
- Hey, Spoon!
- Yeah?

22:51.440 --> 22:54.113
I'm coming with you tomorrow.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.990
That's good.

23:23.160 --> 23:28.632
* Crushed eyes stare
maimed minds wear

23:28.760 --> 23:32.309
* badges of intolerance

23:33.480 --> 23:38.474
* believing that it's their defence for me

23:38.600 --> 23:43.151
* Don't they see there's no hiding?

23:44.560 --> 23:49.680
* There's no hiding, yeah

23:51.360 --> 23:55.069
* Caged souls cry
black tongues lie

23:55.200 --> 23:58.397
* behind walls of ignorance

23:58.600 --> 24:02.991
* armed with indifference for me

24:05.200 --> 24:08.909
* Don't they see

24:09.040 --> 24:13.511
* there's no hiding from me?

24:14.440 --> 24:19.150
* There's no hiding from me

24:22.600 --> 24:28.835
* There's no hiding from me

25:08.040 --> 25:11.430
* So where are you going to go, huh?

25:21.560 --> 25:26.190
Wake up, it's seven a.m..!
Welcome to ''The Sunrise Party''.

25:26.320 --> 25:30.438
Howmany ofyou have already broken
their New Year's resolution. Give us a call

25:30.560 --> 25:34.599
It's going to be
a fucking nightmare day, I just feel it.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.870
Are you going to complain all day?

25:37.000 --> 25:40.356
I said I'd kick,
but I didn't say I was going to like it.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.674
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit!

25:43.800 --> 25:46.314
I told you we should have left early.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.795
Koolaid, how are you doing, nigger?

25:50.080 --> 25:52.958
What's up, Pecker Wood?

25:57.880 --> 26:00.952
- What a fuck are you doing here?
- What a fuck are you doing here?

26:01.080 --> 26:03.719
- New Year's resolution.
- Me, too.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.674
What's the point of
turning getting high into a job, right?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.598
Getting high is supposed to be fun, right?

26:12.400 --> 26:15.472
- What's going up, Spoon?
- How are you doing?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.516
Did you hear about Kosher Dill?.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.359
Oh, man! He got off light and went south.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.358
- With some fine-ass Cuban bitch.
- Really?

26:27.400 --> 26:31.916
I hear you're doing some kind of
poetry shit, or something.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.156
Yes, something.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.312
- So how doth that shit be going?
- Good.

26:40.360 --> 26:44.194
- When do the doors open?
- They're already open.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.834
Is this your first time trying to get into rehab?

26:47.640 --> 26:50.234
- Yeah.
- How about you, Grey Boy?

26:50.840 --> 26:54.594
- Yeah.
- Have you all got a Medicaid card?

26:55.920 --> 26:57.751
No.

26:59.880 --> 27:03.873
You've got to have a Medicaid card
to get into the programme.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.036
Fuck, I ain't got no fucking Medicaid card.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.799
Am I supposed to
get out and get one now? Fuck that!

27:09.400 --> 27:13.712
If you sign up for the HIV test, they say
they'll get you into the programme sooner.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.308
Otherwise, it takes six weeks.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.552
I ain't taking no damn HIV test.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.595
Hold still, please.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.753
I didn't want to have to do this.
What are you going to do?

27:32.880 --> 27:35.792
Press the cotton on that spot, please.

27:36.760 --> 27:41.550
OK, the results will be in tomorrow, gentlemen.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.798
You may go to the front desk
to receive your 40 dollars.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.990
Show them this yellow card.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.032
Your name will be placed on
an HIV-tested waiting list.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.391
It'lltake a week to ten days to get into detox,

27:54.520 --> 27:58.479
and you'll need to bring in your Medicaid
card at that time. Thanks, gentlemen.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.119
Yeah, thanks...

28:03.240 --> 28:08.189
..for nothing, bitch. I don't know
if I want to kick in ten fucking days.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.072
Let's try St James'.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.953
I want to stop by Mud and pick up some bags.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.992
- It's not even 10 o'clock!
- But I haven't had a blow, yet.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.795
No point in walking around sick.
Might as well save that 'til after detox.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.230
I'm going to need some support
if we're going to do this.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.078
I'm with you.

28:25.200 --> 28:31.036
So, what the fuck happened?
You fucked your shit up.

28:31.160 --> 28:35.472
A couple of motherfuckers
came in here and rushed me.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.239
Pistol-whipped me and shit.

28:38.360 --> 28:43.036
I owed the nigger some money,
but I told him I was going to pay him.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.754
They slapped Cee-Cee around and whatnot.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.912
- Damn!
- I'm alright.

28:57.080 --> 29:01.756
- When did all this happen?
- Last night.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.075
Right after you left.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.475
- Right after we left?
- Yeah.

29:08.600 --> 29:13.116
- So, D-Reper is a drug man.
- Yeah, I guess so.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.559
I just put the shit through.!
I've been standing here for three hours.!

29:18.680 --> 29:21.433
You people make me want to drink.
Yno me diga calmate.!

29:22.760 --> 29:24.955
You want to fight with me.
I don't want to hear shit...

29:25.800 --> 29:29.236
- What numbers have you got?
- B 91 and 92.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.592
Fuck!

29:34.760 --> 29:38.833
Excuse me?
The three of you want to move, please?

29:49.720 --> 29:51.517
Fuck...

29:52.360 --> 29:55.989
Fucking great!
We're going to be here all fucking day.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.270
No, we're not. Just chill.

30:00.200 --> 30:05.035
I know this is my third time,
but I still need your help, goddammit! Shit!

30:07.440 --> 30:12.468
How are you doing, papa? You've got
beautiful eyes. God bless your eyes.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.511
Avanta.!

30:15.600 --> 30:18.797
B 57...

30:19.600 --> 30:22.160
NumberB 57...

30:51.920 --> 30:55.037
Was that audience
fucking great tonight, or what?

30:55.160 --> 30:57.276
They were possessed, baby.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.710
Are you kidding? It's New Year's Eve.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.956
They ought to be good tonight.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.233
I love it when you've got the audience
in the palm of your hand,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.749
and they're resting there comfortably.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.316
Then, bam! You crush those fuckers.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.758
There's supposed to be some record
executives to check us out tonight.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.839
Yeah? We're going to scare the shit out of them.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.192
How much time have we got?

31:27.880 --> 31:30.838
We'll be back in a couple of minutes.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.276
Come on, boys, let's roll

32:10.000 --> 32:12.230
Number97.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.953
Last callforB 97.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.994
Number98.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.038
- What?
- Your number's already been called, sir.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.436
I was in the bathroom.
I just missed by a couple of numbers.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.348
We're on number 98, sir.
You'll have to take another number.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.397
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Hey, man.

32:36.520 --> 32:41.389
- Get back behind the line, asshole!
- I'm offering you a ticket, schmuck.

32:41.520 --> 32:46.640
I always take an extra one for him.
These people are such stone-cold pigs.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.877
- Thanks.
- Anytime, brother.

32:52.600 --> 32:56.832
- What?
- The centre is now for alcohol abuse only.

32:56.960 --> 33:02.398
We no longer treat drug addiction.
Someone gave you the wrong information.

33:02.520 --> 33:08.789
Fuck, fuck! Did anybody say anything
about St James' being for alcoholics only?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.719
No, they didn't! Now, what do we have to do?

33:11.840 --> 33:15.628
- Temporary Medicaid.
- What?

33:15.760 --> 33:19.514
We go to Welfare, tellthem it's an
emergency and we need to get into detox.

33:19.640 --> 33:23.713
Spoon, I'm losing my patience with this shit!

33:31.560 --> 33:33.835
- Fuck off!
- Get out of my way.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.832
- What's up, fellas?
- Two dogs with everything.

33:37.960 --> 33:41.191
- Two with everything.
- Give me the same with nothing on them.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.517
You want the same
or two dogs with nothing on them?

33:44.640 --> 33:47.996
- Are you a fucking comedian?
- Can you help me out?

33:48.120 --> 33:50.395
Get the fuck out of here, man!

33:50.520 --> 33:53.080
Oh, man! I'm a veteran,
I've got disabilities, man.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.909
- What's his problem?
- Stop busting my customers' balls.

33:57.040 --> 34:01.033
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Yeah, that's nice. I like that.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.189
I'm paying for the white guy.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.117
Thanks.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.757
- Two dogs with everything.
- Thanks.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.678
- Two dogs with nothing on them.
- Get a fucking job!

34:22.480 --> 34:24.471
Hold up, chief, hold up!

34:24.600 --> 34:26.511
No food or beverages.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.434
Right, hold my dogs 'til I come back.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.916
Hold on, I've got to search you. Hands up.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.559
What's that?

34:36.679 --> 34:38.033
Chain.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.679
OK, turn around.

34:43.639 --> 34:45.630
Thank you.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.840
Empty your pockets, please.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.118
Hands up.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.871
Turn around, please.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.274
Thank you.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.834
Thanks.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.877
How do you think Cookie is doing?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.309
She'll pullthrough.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.755
She'd better.

35:54.160 --> 35:57.072
Excuse me, sir. There's no smoking.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.477
Look, bro. I said there's no smoking.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.194
- Next.
- Happy now?

36:17.560 --> 36:19.676
Hi, how are you doing, beautiful?.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.360
Fine. May I help you?

36:23.240 --> 36:26.152
We'd like to apply for temporary Medicaid cards.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.909
- Are you on welfare?
- No.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.793
You've got to be on welfare to get Medicaid.

36:34.440 --> 36:39.798
The only reason we need Medicaid
is to get on a rehab programme today.

36:39.920 --> 36:43.071
Sorry, but that's still going to take
four to six weeks.

36:44.880 --> 36:47.474
We don't have four to six weeks, ma'am.

36:48.280 --> 36:49.679
Next.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.271
The problem is, it's going to Lansing
and back. These things take time.

36:54.400 --> 36:59.235
Temporary Medicaid cards are issued
only for medical necessities.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.670
Why is everything
such a fucking hassle with you guys?

37:03.440 --> 37:09.117
I sit here in need of help, and you give
me bullshit about ''medical necessities''?

37:09.240 --> 37:12.949
It is a fucking necessity for me
to get into fucking detox

37:13.080 --> 37:16.550
before I kill some-motherfucking-body!

37:16.680 --> 37:19.274
Do you understand what I'm fucking saying?

37:22.240 --> 37:24.231
Yeah, I understand.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.068
Oh, I understand.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.556
Let me see if you understand this, my man:

37:31.680 --> 37:34.274
Rules are rules.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.791
Am I supposed to change them
because you sit across there screaming?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.512
Take a look at you.

37:41.640 --> 37:46.350
You fucking walk in here
after five, ten, however many years,

37:46.480 --> 37:50.109
and because today is the day you decide to kick,

37:50.240 --> 37:54.631
the whole fucking world is supposed to stop?!

37:54.760 --> 37:56.591
Is that it?

37:57.520 --> 38:01.638
We've all been waiting for the day
that you come through that door

38:01.760 --> 38:08.154
and tell us you no longer
want to be a fucking dope fiend! Right?

38:11.040 --> 38:14.396
Get the fuck away from my desk.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.719
My brother, my brother.

38:19.840 --> 38:23.549
Look, it's been a long day.
We're all stressed-out.

38:23.680 --> 38:28.629
We've been getting the run-around
and we really don't know what to do.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.031
Downtown...

38:42.280 --> 38:44.271
Woodward and Jefferson.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.552
Thanks a lot, my brother. Come on, man.

38:59.880 --> 39:04.192
- Fuck it, I need a blow.
- I don't know, Spoon.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.151
I'm just starting to feel a little fucked-up.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.272
- OK.
- We'll be in and out.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.316
Mud?

39:19.320 --> 39:21.197
Hey, Mud!

39:22.240 --> 39:24.515
Hey!

39:26.400 --> 39:28.470
Mud?

39:32.600 --> 39:34.795
- What the fuck?
- Yo, Mud!

39:43.640 --> 39:45.870
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

39:48.160 --> 39:51.152
- Don't touch him!
- He might still be alive.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.236
That, my friends, was fucking great!

40:10.440 --> 40:14.956
- That show was the ''shizit''.
- Did you see the record company guy?

40:16.800 --> 40:19.553
Said it's cool on Wednesday.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.719
- He's a nice guy.
- Yeah? What else did he say?

40:30.040 --> 40:33.077
- Give me that.
- What the fuck?

40:33.200 --> 40:36.033
Give it here,
me and Stretch should do it.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.628
- I want to try some.
- No!

40:38.760 --> 40:41.433
- It's New Year's Eve, come on!
- Get the fuck out of here, Cookie.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.074
- You never do blow.
- He gave it to me.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.668
It's mine and I just want to try some.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.195
This shit is fucked-up.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.951
Yeah...

41:18.920 --> 41:20.751
Who do you think it was?

41:20.880 --> 41:23.440
It could have been any-fucking-body.

41:26.760 --> 41:30.799
Why are you still using that spoon
for cooking dope?

41:32.120 --> 41:34.588
The finer shit's evaporating.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.957
You should use a vitamin cap
or cheese cap or something.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.230
Why?

41:42.360 --> 41:46.717
Because aluminium is a better
conductor of heat than steel

41:46.840 --> 41:49.673
- No shit.
- Yeah.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.155
Copper would be even better.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.431
I don't really know
where you're going to find a copper top.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.512
I'd go with aluminium.

41:58.640 --> 42:03.270
Fuck aluminium, man.
You get Alzheimer's off it. Old-timers...

42:03.400 --> 42:06.392
Wasn't that what Mohammad Ali got?

42:08.400 --> 42:13.474
He's fucked-up. He used to be so quick...

42:15.400 --> 42:19.791
..fast-talking and shit. It's kind of sad.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.515
He's still got a quick mind.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.108
The shit just comes out a lot slower.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.792
This is some seriously good shit.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.874
I can't believe we found Mud's stash.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.908
- I knew where it was.
- How much was in it?

43:06.240 --> 43:10.552
I don't know... Maybe three ounces.

43:10.680 --> 43:14.150
What? This is allyou fucking brought out?

43:15.320 --> 43:17.072
If we're kicking, we don't need it.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.512
Fuck that! What if we don't get
into the programme today?

43:21.640 --> 43:24.950
We're going to fucking need it then.

43:25.080 --> 43:29.312
We could sell it, give it away, anything.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.910
You can't leave three ounces
of free dope sitting in here.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.994
Look, I'm not walking around
with three ounces of dope in my pocket.

43:39.120 --> 43:42.078
- We don't need it.
- Fuck you!

43:42.200 --> 43:46.591
I'll fucking carry it.
Let's just get the dope and get out of here.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.433
No.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.511
- Come on!
- No.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.791
While you're in there, grab me a diet iced tea.

43:59.920 --> 44:03.754
- I can't believe you sometimes!
- What are you talking about?

44:03.960 --> 44:07.396
- I can't believe...
- Oh, shit!

44:07.520 --> 44:10.193
Did you guys hear any gunshots?

44:10.320 --> 44:14.108
- No, we haven't.
- Somebody reported shots from this building.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.471
I didn't hear... We didn't... It was nothing.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.955
What about him? Does he talk?

44:22.080 --> 44:25.117
- How about you? Did you hear anything?
- No.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.919
- What's your name?
- Bob.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.600
- Bob?
- Yeah.

44:34.720 --> 44:41.159
- Do you have a last name?
- Yeah... Most people just call me ''Bob''.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.597
Do you think this is a joke?

44:49.520 --> 44:51.511
Johnson.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.992
I can't hear you.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.479
Robert Johnson.

45:03.760 --> 45:07.435
- How about you?
- John Doman.

45:11.240 --> 45:14.789
- Do you live in this building?
- We were here to visit a friend.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.669
Was I talking to you?

45:22.120 --> 45:23.633
OK, get out of here.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.996
- Hey!
- Oh, fuck...

45:53.120 --> 45:55.475
What's her name?

45:56.080 --> 45:58.355
Your friend in the building. What's her name?

45:58.480 --> 46:02.917
Sharon... Sharon Barnes. Third floor.

46:32.240 --> 46:35.437
The problem is that we've got fundamental
differences in our belief systems.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.757
You believe in the good of man,
everything's going to work out.

46:38.880 --> 46:41.633
I knowthe world is a fuck-up
and nothing's going to work out.

46:41.760 --> 46:44.991
- Don't put your arm on me, man!
- What?

46:45.120 --> 46:48.874
You smell disgusting! Look at
your pants. Is that puke on your pants?

46:49.000 --> 46:53.073
- Get the fuck out of here! That ain't puke!
- It sure smells like it.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.270
Fuck you! What's the address?

46:55.880 --> 46:57.757
Medicaid. First and Jefferson.

46:57.880 --> 47:03.034
We were standing on First and there's
Jefferson, but I don't see any Medicaid.

47:03.160 --> 47:06.755
- Excuse me!
- Sorry, no spare change.

47:06.880 --> 47:10.270
I just wanted directions.
Just some fucking directions!

47:11.640 --> 47:13.756
Hey!

47:13.880 --> 47:17.953
Would you come on? Come the fuck on!

47:47.760 --> 47:51.469
- I was a bad-ass builder about 50 years ago.
- Yeah.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.270
How are you doing?

48:01.080 --> 48:02.718
Medicaid, please.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.195
Three lefts, a right and a left. Eighth floor.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.072
Two rights, two lefts and a right?

48:08.360 --> 48:11.397
Yeah. Two rights, three lefts
and another two lefts.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.195
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

48:17.320 --> 48:19.390
Hold that elevator!

48:21.360 --> 48:24.113
- I can believe you said that.
- Yes, I did.

48:24.240 --> 48:28.631
You've got to tell a brother
because they'll be in your...

48:28.840 --> 48:33.197
Excuse me, my sisters. We came here
to apply for temporary Medicaid cards.

48:33.320 --> 48:37.996
They moved out three weeks ago.
You have to go to the new office,

48:38.120 --> 48:40.429
18063, Gratiot.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.949
No, they just told us to come here.

48:43.080 --> 48:49.110
We only do referrals here, now. 18063, Gratiot.

48:49.240 --> 48:52.949
So I said to him, ''Help?
I don't need no help. I've got a job.''

48:53.080 --> 48:55.958
OK, right. Hello?

48:56.080 --> 48:58.355
But then he had to
say something, you know?

48:58.480 --> 49:01.790
- I don't know...
- She couldn't leave it at putting up with him...

49:01.920 --> 49:03.751
Is there anything else?

49:17.280 --> 49:19.555
This fucking country is falling apart, man.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.990
People don't give a shit. It's ridiculous.

49:25.120 --> 49:29.079
The people with these government jobs
sit on their asses, taking their time.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.829
You can't get them to help you,
and if they do, they give you allthis attitude

49:32.960 --> 49:37.078
like you're wasting their time.
Excuse me, it's your fucking job!

49:38.240 --> 49:42.597
My tax dollars are paying
your wages, I'm your fucking boss!

49:42.720 --> 49:46.872
Sometimes you want to reach across
the desk and choke the shit out of them.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.274
Too right!

49:48.400 --> 49:51.472
Don't bust my balls because you hate
your job. At least you've got one.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.989
There's a lot of people who can't get one.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.953
And if you do get a job
there's no fucking security.

49:57.080 --> 50:01.915
A friend's cousin's sister's brother-in-law
worked for the same company for 20 years.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.759
Then what happened?
They fired his fucking ass!

50:05.400 --> 50:07.072
Excuse me.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.877
- Hey, I'm talking to you!
- What?

50:10.000 --> 50:13.117
- What?
- I believe you have something that's ours.

50:13.240 --> 50:17.677
- Is that fucking so?
- Yeah, and we'd like to get it back.

50:17.800 --> 50:21.679
I'm sorry, I try not to carry more than
one pair of pantyhose with me.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.312
That's some funny shit.
Come here, motherfucker!

50:27.440 --> 50:30.512
Come on, get in the goddamn car!

50:30.640 --> 50:34.394
Officers!
Officers, I'm so glad to see you!

50:34.520 --> 50:37.751
- We can't find the...
- ..Department of Social Services.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.872
Yeah, the Social Services.
We asked the kind gentlemen here,

50:41.000 --> 50:42.956
but they can't help us.

50:43.080 --> 50:46.914
- It's aroundthe corner, up on the left.
- Just on the left.

50:47.960 --> 50:50.633
Thanks a lot. Mind if we walk with you?

50:50.760 --> 50:54.912
- Maybe you could point it out for us.
- It's around the corner, on the left.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.600
- Yeah.
- You can't miss it.

50:59.960 --> 51:02.872
- Is there a problem?
- No.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.638
No, no problem.

51:05.680 --> 51:07.796
Well, yeah, there is.

51:08.920 --> 51:11.434
How long do you train at police academy for?

51:11.560 --> 51:13.357
What?

51:13.480 --> 51:18.110
I was just wondering how long it takes
to become a police officer.

51:19.680 --> 51:22.433
It's just that I'm thinking
of becoming a policeman.

51:22.560 --> 51:26.553
Going down, putting an application in...
I wanted to know how long will it take, you know,

51:26.680 --> 51:28.352
for me to able to serve and protect.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.118
- Protect and serve.
- Absolutely.

51:31.800 --> 51:35.793
I can't find my Filofax right
now. Can I borrow yours for a moment?

51:38.360 --> 51:40.396
Fucking guy... Alright.

51:45.360 --> 51:49.194
Here. Personnel's open from eight to four, OK?

51:49.320 --> 51:51.276
Thanks a lot.

51:51.400 --> 51:54.915
You know, you guys are really great guys.

51:55.040 --> 51:57.759
I think cops get a bum rap sometimes.

51:57.880 --> 52:01.236
You are helping out a citizen with directions
and employment information.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.749
You guys are great. You're professional

52:03.880 --> 52:08.351
Do you ever hear about guys like you?
The ones who care and want to make a difference?

52:08.480 --> 52:11.711
No, all you hear about are the racists.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.071
The ones who use excessive force.
The ones who are on the take.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.272
The ones who shoot their wives. Never you guys.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.595
Never the ones who truly serve and protect.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.837
- Protect and serve.
- Absolutely.

52:23.960 --> 52:28.272
- You guys are my kind of guys. Nice cops.
- Yeah, thanks...

52:28.400 --> 52:32.678
You're the second set of nice people
we've met today. You guys,

52:32.800 --> 52:36.076
and those guys. You see those guys?

52:36.200 --> 52:39.033
Those guys are really nice guys, too.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.515
We asked those guys for directions.

52:41.640 --> 52:46.873
They didn't know where Social Security was,
but they were willing to help, even drive us.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.195
There go some really nice guys.

52:53.280 --> 52:55.953
Well, thanks for everything.

52:56.080 --> 52:58.878
You say it's just around the corner
on the left, right?

52:59.000 --> 53:00.274
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:00.880 --> 53:03.713
Thanks again. I'm going to look into this.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.989
What the fuck was that?

53:35.920 --> 53:40.436
That was fucking great!
Did you see those motherfuckers take off?

53:42.040 --> 53:44.076
Yeah.

53:45.920 --> 53:49.993
What the fuck did they mean by
''give us our shit back?''

53:50.120 --> 53:52.759
Probably the fucking dope.

53:55.200 --> 53:57.714
What I can't understand is,

53:57.840 --> 54:02.356
how the fuck do we leave Mud's,
go downtown, come out of Social Security,

54:02.480 --> 54:06.155
and have two guys waiting for us
talking about us giving their shit back?

54:06.280 --> 54:09.238
Doesn't that seem a bit strange to you?

54:09.360 --> 54:12.432
Who gives a fuck? We lost them.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.471
We've only got to
get to Medicaid before it closes,

54:14.600 --> 54:17.831
because if it doesn't happen today,
it ain't ever going to happen.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.190
Yeah.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.834
It's about two blocks that way.

54:24.960 --> 54:28.430
- What time is it?
- 4:30.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.479
- Let's stop and get some breakfast.
- Yeah.

54:35.920 --> 54:38.195
Ding-ding!

54:42.520 --> 54:45.637
This is Bill Jacobs
with the evening news.

54:45.760 --> 54:47.352
Knock, knock!

54:47.480 --> 54:49.596
Knock, knock!

54:52.320 --> 54:54.276
What can I do for you, governor?

54:54.400 --> 54:58.029
- What kind of sandwiches have you got?
- What?

54:58.160 --> 55:00.230
What kind of sandwiches have you got?

55:08.120 --> 55:11.112
Turning to the West Side. A vicious
double homicide has been discovered

55:11.240 --> 55:13.356
near Grant River and Hamilton Avenues.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.836
We now go live to news caster Alexia
Cruz with resident Patty Robinson.

55:16.960 --> 55:21.351
It makes no sense. If someone called about
gunshots in a rich neighbourhood

55:21.480 --> 55:24.313
they would have been there in a flash.

55:24.440 --> 55:27.477
- Give me a cheeseburger with everything.
- What?

55:27.600 --> 55:31.673
- A cheeseburger with everything!
- How about you, senator?

55:31.800 --> 55:34.712
Give me a BLT!

55:36.400 --> 55:39.437
The man was found dead
on the floor, shot several times.

55:39.560 --> 55:42.279
The woman was discovered
in the closet, also shot...

55:42.400 --> 55:45.153
- That's Mud's place!
- She was found to be pregnant.

55:45.280 --> 55:50.195
The police think it was drug-related
and are looking for these two suspects.

55:50.320 --> 55:53.039
One African-American and one Caucasian,

55:53.160 --> 55:58.154
encountered by police while leaving
the scene of this horrible crime.

56:00.920 --> 56:05.232
This is Alexia Cruz, PrimeAction News.
Back to you, Bill

56:08.960 --> 56:12.032
- What are we going to do?
- They killed Cee-Cee!

56:12.160 --> 56:18.030
- They fucking killed Cee-Cee, too!
- Hey, what the fuck are we going to do?

56:22.800 --> 56:27.749
OK. We've got to get off the fucking streets.

56:27.880 --> 56:32.078
We're going to go in here and talk to
somebody about a programme.

56:32.200 --> 56:35.158
We're going to tell them
what we have to tell them. Whatever!

56:35.280 --> 56:39.751
We're going to get off the streets today. OK?

56:39.880 --> 56:41.916
Yeah.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.874
Fillthis out and bring it back to me.

56:54.720 --> 56:57.598
- Fillthis out and bring it back to me.
- Thank you.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.475
Could you put the cigarette out, please?

57:03.920 --> 57:06.798
Fillthis out and bring it back to me.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.750
Melvin Goldman.

57:17.720 --> 57:20.359
MrMelvin Goldman.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.710
I had a homeboy in high school
named Melvin Goldman.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.833
Sure would freak the fuck out of me
if he walked up to the counter.

57:38.080 --> 57:40.799
Little crazy-ass Melvin Goldman.

57:42.320 --> 57:45.118
The first time I got high I was with Melvin.

57:45.240 --> 57:48.437
This is one of those rich motherfuckers.
The parents had everything.

57:48.560 --> 57:52.553
There were always six or eight of us
ghetto motherfuckers at his house.

57:53.800 --> 57:56.837
I remember one night
when his parents were out of town.

57:56.960 --> 57:59.235
We were getting fucked-up,
smoking, playing pool

57:59.360 --> 58:05.833
We were drinking some 151 proof rum
that we got someone to buy for us.

58:06.640 --> 58:11.270
And this guy comes in with some
white powder, like ''who wants to try?''

58:11.400 --> 58:13.550
I didn't know what the shit was.

58:13.680 --> 58:18.117
All I had ever done
was maybe smoke a joint once.

58:19.240 --> 58:23.313
We were young and stupid. And it was fun.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.639
So we said, ''Fuck it, let's try some.''

58:29.160 --> 58:31.310
Everybody got sick as dogs.

58:31.440 --> 58:34.432
The motherfuckers were running around
throwing up and shit.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.476
And for me...

58:42.920 --> 58:46.117
For me that shit
was like going back to the womb.

58:47.760 --> 58:52.276
I never felt such peace. I was home.

58:52.400 --> 58:55.710
I was sixteen fucking years old!

58:57.240 --> 59:01.836
Whoo! First you just
got fucked-up on weekends.

59:01.960 --> 59:05.270
Then... Well..

59:08.880 --> 59:11.110
Life is funny, ain't it?

59:12.320 --> 59:16.029
Somehow I don't think
this was my parents' dream for me.

59:19.720 --> 59:21.790
Look at this!

59:22.720 --> 59:26.713
- Get rid of the dope and I'll finish this.
- Yeah.

59:31.720 --> 59:34.837
Mr EzekielWhitmore, please.

59:35.840 --> 59:40.356
- EzekielWhitmore!
- Here!

59:41.600 --> 59:46.469
You came too late. It's almost five and
we're not giving out more appointments,

59:46.600 --> 59:51.151
so I'm going to stamp your application this way.

59:51.280 --> 59:54.317
Come back tomorrow. You can
go directly to me without waiting.

59:54.440 --> 59:56.431
I can't wait 'tiltomorrow, sir.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.915
Me and my friend need to get to a detox today.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.508
We've been running from office to office all day.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.599
I understand, but the best I can do
for you is give you an appointment,

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.518
and even if I did that
you wouldn't get Medicaid today.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.279
You have to come back in ten days
to see an interviewer.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.551
Once they've reviewed your case,
they'll notify you by mail

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.238
That can take a month.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.716
So whoever told me about getting
Medicaid in one day was bullshitting me?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.833
I would say that is correct.
Either that, or they were misinformed.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.431
See, the only way to get on
is if you're HIV infected.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.828
- Yeah?
- But you need a letter of proof from your doctor.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.952
I took an HIV test this morning
at the New Centre Clinic.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.116
They told me I could get Medicaid sooner.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.233
- Hm... When willyour results be in?
- Tomorrow.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.238
It's like I said. You come back tomorrow.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.749
You come to my desk after you get the results.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.871
That way, you won't have to wait in line.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.956
Yeah. Thanks.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.794
Oh, shit!

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.758
Shit! Excuse me, pardon...

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.354
- Stretch!
- Yeah. How did it go?

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.951
The fucking ''5-0''
just came in. We've got to get out of here.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.354
Give me a minute.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.951
You know that crap about getting
Medicaid the same day? It's all drama!

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.834
You've got to be HIV positive
to get on. Ain't that some shit?

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.315
I'm HIV positive.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.795
Spoon, are you alright?

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.198
I would have mentioned it before,
but I didn't know how you'd take it.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.756
I've always used my own works, and everything.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.997
- Does Cookie know?
- No.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.157
It really didn't get far enough
for me to have to tell her.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.511
You're the first person I ever told.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.475
What the fuck are you doing?
I can't believe you, man!

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.194
I tellyou to get rid of it
and what do you do?

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.915
What am I supposed to do,
flush it down the toilet? Fuck that!

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.429
- ''5-0s''!
- Freeze! Come out of there now!

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.394
Put your hands up
and get out of there.!

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.512
Move it! Get out of there now, motherfucker!

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.999
Wipe it!

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.111
Get out of there! I said now!

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.638
Fucking junkies, come here! Come here,
motherfucker! Against the wall!

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.876
Turn around. Keep them up there!

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.151
Do you have any fucking weapons on you?

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.549
What do I have to do
to get some attention around here?

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.434
Get up!

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.508
I'm a human being, too!

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.590
Let's get out of here! Come on, move!

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.400
We have a situation!

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.713
I don't want to live in a dump!

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.916
I fought in
the fucking war and it ain't shit!

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.033
I'll drag the whole goddamn government down,

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.755
before I'll let them take me out like this.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.236
Is this my homecoming?

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.391
Is this my fucking ticker-tape parade?

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.714
Well, I can't see it!

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.558
Incoming!

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.269
- Incoming!
- Freeze, sir!

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.473
- Excuse me?
- Cllyour dog or I'll have to shoot it.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.150
I said you callyour dog or he's dead.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.556
Nixon, heel! Heel, Nixon! Here!

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.955
Nixon, come on! Good boy.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.633
Good boy. Yes. Good, Nixon.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.638
Good, Nixon. Good, Nixon. Yeah.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.116
Yes, yes. Good boy, good boy.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.993
Name, rank, serial number.
Name, rank, serial number.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.237

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.150
Hi.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.115
Move! Move away!
Move, motherfucker!

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.800
Move, move, move, move!

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.392
- Have you still got the dope?
- No, I flushed it down the toilet.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.672
Freeze!

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.590
They ain't fucking gone!
Still think that's not strange?

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.836
Yes, it's a little fucking strange.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.596
If they keep shooting,
they're going to get lucky!

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.912
You know, you've still got time
to go back and kick his ass!

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.270
I'll get him later.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.274
- What are you doing, man?
- Assholes!

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.188
Number97. Last call B 97.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.871
Come on, my man!

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.270
Sussex and Alley. Six and Lafayette.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.788
- I've got to stop.
- Come on, they're here!

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.716
Shit!

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.839
Freeze, both of you! Freeze!

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:20.750
- Turn around!
- Take all their weapons!

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.676
Give me your arm!

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.314
Spoon, I've got to do something.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.676
I'm going to fucking die here.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.238
You ain't going to fucking die.
It's just a flesh wound.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.838
You think so? It feels like
I'm fucking bleeding to death.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.511
No, you'll be alright.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.836
OK, it's getting dark.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.192
Here's what we're going to do.
I want you to stab me.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.912
- What?
- Stab me.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.190
Get the fuck out of here! I ain't stabbing you!

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.517
If we're in the Emergency Room
we're off the streets.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.200
Once we're in the hospital we can kick, Stretch.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.993
What are you tripping off? I'll be the one cut!

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.714
Besides, it's a pocketknife.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.751
I don't feel comfortable with that.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.189
Come on, Stretch. We can't be out here all night.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.279
You're bleeding all over the place.
You've got to go, anyway.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.957
- Where?
- Where what?

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.359
- Where do you want me to stab you?
- Oh. Where do you think is best?

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.108
If I stab you in the stomach
I might hit some organs and shit.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.119
Yeah, you're right. Not the stomach.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.918
What about the arm?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.396
Nah, too wimpy.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.350
If you turn around I can stab you in the back.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:21.234
No, you'll fucking paralyse me! Not the back.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.352
OK, my liver is on the left,
the stomach's on the...

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.837
No, my liver's on the left, my kidneys
are back here and my stomach's on the right.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.830
No, my stomach's on the...
Or are my kidneys on the left?

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.793
I think the stomach's to the left.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.078
I know my lungs are right here and
I definitely don't want a punctured lung.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.355
What about if I stab you between the organs?

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.392
Maybe between where
the stomach and the kidneys meet?

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.275
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.153
- Right here.
- Yeah.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.191
Wait, wait, wait!

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.028
Let's go over there, in the light.
You'll kill me over here.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.276
- Which side did you say?
- This side.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.438
- Right there.
- Yeah. Come on, let's do it.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.869
Aahh! That fucking hurts!

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.870
Fuck! Oh, shit, you didn't even
break the fucking skin, man!

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.549
- The fucking knife's too dull
- Oh, fuck!

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.076
Do it again.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.558
Aahh! Shit!

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.195
- Again.
- Again?

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.880
Do it again!

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.511
Aahh!

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.995
Oh, my God!

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.276
Shit! Again.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.597
Aahh! Aahh!

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:21.759
Shit! Oh, shit! Okay, O-fucking-kay!

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.991
Goddamn! Oh, my fucking God!

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.918
- Are you OK?
- Shit!

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:32.793
- Yeah.
- Looks good, though.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.676
- Do you think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, it looks good.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.271
Alright, come on.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.070
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. Shit, that hurts.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.514
Get a doctor!

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.154
Are they ''Code Yellow''?

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.511
No, we've got a surface
gunshot wound to the arm on one

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.553
and several lacerations in the side on the other.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.271
Pick them up and put them over there.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.080
Thisjustin tonight.
A shoot-out withpolice

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.077
ended with
the apprehension oftwo suspects

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.760
apparently linkedto
drug-relatedmurders,

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.112
including one today in which a man and
apregnant woman were shot to death

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.439
in their EastSide apartment.
Alexia Cruz is at police headquarters.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:25.156
Ballistics found that one of the guns in
the shoot-out was usedin today's murders

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.159
and is possibly the same gun used
in several recent drug-related killings.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.068
The gun is believed to be registered
to an undercover police officer.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.237
This could be the biggest break yet
in a series of murders

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.794
- where millions in drugs and cash...
- Nurse!

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.275
..have been stolen
over the last six months.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.836
As you can see, the suspects are
being transferred to the county jail

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.076
where they will be held
until tomorrow's arraignment.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.430
Excuse me, gentlemen...

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.471
They got them.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.512
Hello, hello...

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.872
As you can see, Bill, mum's the word here.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.709
This is Alexia Cruz, PrimeAction News.
Back to you in the studio.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.831
Thank you, Alexia. Also in tonight.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.918

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.555
went on a rampage today
at a West Side Social Services office.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.319
The branch,
locatedat 10863, EightMile Road

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.989
sustained an undetermined amount
of damage caused by the veteran,

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:23.432
now identified as James W. Stewart,
and his dog, Nixon.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:26.552
Miraculously, no one was injured
in this bizarre incident.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.918
Mr Stewart had been recently attempting
to receive benefits with no success.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.749
When asked why the violent reaction,
Mr Stewart simply said.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.757
''I was tired of getting the run-around. ''

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.952
A police officer and several
by standers were hurt during the mélée.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.230
Paramedics were called to the scene...

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.476
Listen, I've got to see a doctor.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.917
Take a seat, sir. Your name will be called.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.115
Mr Hanser!

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.312
Mr William Hanser.!

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.997
MrLarry Williams.!

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.476
Larry.!

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.358
Leave a message afterthe beep.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.234
Spoon, Stretchie? Pick up!

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.717
Are you there? Come on!
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.989
I can't believe you guys dumped me
in that raggedy-ass hospital

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.635
I'll  fucking kill you when I get home.
Come on, pick up!

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.199
I know you're there listening to me, arseholes.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.993
Are you going to pick up the phone, or what?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.237
We're supposed to see
that record guy tomorrow.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.114
I was thinking that if
we're going to do this record thing,

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:09.759
maybe you guys should start thinking
about kicking, know what I mean?

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.393
This could be
a really big break for us, you know.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.558
I just thought tonight is as good a time as any.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.036
Maybe get a clean break for the new year.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:24.799
A New Year's resolution.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:29.072
I hear they've got these programmes
that are easy to get into.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.910
What do you think? Hello? Hello?

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.115
Shit.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.353
Hell of a way to start the new year.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:22.509
- Ezekiel Whitmore.
- Here.!

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.437
That was about fucking time.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.354
* Land of the free and home of the enslaved

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:07.597
* To the concept of time

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.915
* Six hours, twenty-two minutes,
three seconds

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.190
* I've been standing in this county line

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.234
* By the looks of the gridlock outside

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.193
* it's going to be about 3:3

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.470
* Everybody rushing from place to place

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.193
* The looks on their face
no different from mine

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.119
* Both of us look like
we've just worked a nine-to-five.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.476
* What are they rushing
for is my interest

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.998
* Rushing through trafficjam
to get to emergency room trafficjam

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.112
* that's supposed to be a free clinic

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.111
* to hear that you have
or if you don't have insurance

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.710
* it ain't nothing but the survival of the fittest

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.272
* What are they rushing for?

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.915
* Damn, this man at the window is slow

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.999
* The concept of time has us all fucked

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.398
* and on top of that life
ain't nothing but a trafficjam

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.670
* Life is too short, I feel trapped
Hoping I don't get caught, watch my back

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.597
* Lost in the traffic, heartless and tragic

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.678
* Don't want to get my ass kicked
so I walk in a smiley state

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:33.679
* Don't make me feel this way
I tell you, life is a trafficjam, I'm stuck

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.597
* When will you realise you're fucked?

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.632
* Don't try to change my ways, I'm hopeless,
victims to the games we play.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.799
* Stay focused, watch for the crazy ride, don't lie
Hard to the day we die is my life

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.390
* Tell me if you fear me, I tell you
life is a trafficjam, sincerely

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.432
* Stretch your mind, feed your soul
Three voices you can't control

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:53.599
* Remember, life is a trafficjam
Life is a trafficjam

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.315
* Life is a trafficjam
Life is a trafficjam

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.513
* Life is a trafficjam

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.353
* Life is a trafficjam

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.632
Thanks! Thanks a lot!

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.959
