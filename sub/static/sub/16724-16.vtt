I can't believe we're
at school on a Saturday.

00:21.593 --> 00:23.794
The Cotton Candy Festival
is today at Wonder Wharf!

00:23.795 --> 00:25.796
I heard they have unusual
and exotic flavors.

00:25.797 --> 00:27.898
Like lasagna.
And chimichurri!

00:27.899 --> 00:30.301
Well, you'll never know since
you'll all be in detention.

00:30.302 --> 00:32.470
Dad, Tina will give you all
the money in her bank account

00:32.470 --> 00:34.071
if you take us to Wonder Wharf
right now.

00:34.072 --> 00:35.406
Please? By the time we get

00:35.407 --> 00:37.608
out of detention,
the festival will be over.

00:37.609 --> 00:39.944
Well, you should've thought about
that before you got in trouble.

00:39.945 --> 00:42.647
Good kids eat cotton,
bad kids eat notton'.

00:42.648 --> 00:44.649
I can't believe you won't go
to detention for me.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.651
I already told you,
if I could I would,

00:46.652 --> 00:48.386
but I can't fit into
your clothes, Tammy.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.488
You know I want to. You want
to go to detention for me

00:50.489 --> 00:51.756
or you want to wear my clothes?

00:51.757 --> 00:53.758
J-Just go.

00:53.759 --> 00:55.760
Mom, I can't believe
I got detention.

00:55.761 --> 00:59.130
Don't even worry about it.
You're, like, really pretty.

00:59.164 --> 01:02.166
All day, huh? Oof, this is gonna
suck for you, really.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.435
Hey, there's Bob. Hey, Belcher!

01:04.436 --> 01:06.437
You got three kids
in detention, huh?

01:06.438 --> 01:07.438
Yeah, Jimmy.

01:07.439 --> 01:10.274
I only got one. I win!

01:10.309 --> 01:13.311
Well, I... had none in...
detention yesterday!

01:13.312 --> 01:15.279
How many did you have in...

01:15.314 --> 01:17.114
Don't roll up your window!
(yelling indistinctly)

01:17.149 --> 01:18.282
Roll it back down!

01:18.317 --> 01:20.451
(tires screech)

01:20.485 --> 01:21.752
MR. FROND: <i>Well? Do any of you</i>

01:21.787 --> 01:23.187
have anything to say
for yourselves

01:23.188 --> 01:25.089
after what happened yesterday
at school?

01:25.123 --> 01:26.524
I have something to say.

01:26.525 --> 01:28.826
I'd like to apologize
on behalf of Tammy.

01:28.860 --> 01:30.861
She's a horrible person
who caused all of this,

01:30.862 --> 01:33.130
and everyone should be released
from this hell pit except her.

01:33.131 --> 01:35.466
Thank you. You're a liar
without a hair dryer.

01:35.467 --> 01:37.301
This is your sister's fault!

01:37.302 --> 01:38.536
I'm a boy!

01:38.537 --> 01:40.171
Not you, Gene. Tina.

01:40.172 --> 01:42.073
She caused all of this.

01:42.074 --> 01:43.908
If by "caused" you mean
"didn't cause," then, yeah,

01:43.909 --> 01:45.509
I caused this. High five. Sure.

01:45.510 --> 01:47.511
Ow. Too hard.
From what I remember,

01:47.512 --> 01:52.383
this was caused by one thing
and one thing only: fashion.

01:52.417 --> 01:54.252
(sighs) Okay, so this is it.

01:54.253 --> 01:55.853
Day one with my new look.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.855
I can't believe
I'm wearing this at school.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.657
I barely recognize you.

01:59.691 --> 02:01.659
Maybe I shouldn't do it.
No, no.

02:01.693 --> 02:03.694
If you want to dazzle,
you got to take razzles.

02:03.695 --> 02:05.529
That's a dazzling way
to say "risks."

02:05.530 --> 02:07.932
You take fashion risks
with your fashion wrists.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.866
Hi, how are you guys?

02:09.868 --> 02:12.003
They're speechless, Tina.
They don't know what to say

02:12.037 --> 02:14.238
because they've never seen
anything so original.

02:14.239 --> 02:17.341
I think you're right.
Guys, this is going great.

02:17.342 --> 02:19.110
(gasps) (gasps)

02:19.111 --> 02:20.778
Oh, my God!

02:20.779 --> 02:23.414
Tina's wearing the same
bracelet as you, Tammy!

02:23.448 --> 02:25.049
Tina, you need to take
that off right now.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.884
Sparkle jelly bracelets are
my thing since yesterday

02:26.885 --> 02:28.386
when I bought it.
Yeah.

02:28.420 --> 02:30.087
Tammy, I understand
you're disappointed.

02:30.088 --> 02:32.423
I'm a little disappointed, too.
Before I saw it on you,

02:32.424 --> 02:34.158
I thought
this bracelet was classy.

02:34.193 --> 02:37.528
Take... it... off.

02:37.563 --> 02:40.031
I... would... rather... die.

02:40.032 --> 02:41.532
Then you will die!

02:41.533 --> 02:42.633
(all shouting)

02:43.936 --> 02:45.369
Get off my sister!

02:45.370 --> 02:47.638
Hey! You guys playing Red Rover?

02:47.639 --> 02:49.607
Send Zeke on over!

02:49.608 --> 02:52.109
I don't know what to do! The
fire department will fix this!

02:52.110 --> 02:53.077
(fire alarm ringing)

02:53.111 --> 02:55.112
Yeah! Foam party!

02:55.113 --> 02:57.248
(shouting)

02:57.282 --> 03:00.351
Detention! Saturday!

03:00.385 --> 03:01.719
All of you!
What?!

03:01.720 --> 03:02.954
Admit it, Tina, the only reason

03:02.955 --> 03:04.722
you wore
that sparkle jelly bracelet

03:04.723 --> 03:07.258
was because you wanted
to copy me, okay?

03:07.292 --> 03:09.060
That's not true.
I wore it because I wanted

03:09.061 --> 03:10.728
to make a statement
without saying a word.

03:10.762 --> 03:12.997
Mm-kay, well, I have
a statement for you then.

03:12.998 --> 03:14.765
(grunts) Darn it! Ugh!

03:14.766 --> 03:16.767
Why can't I fart when I want to?

03:16.802 --> 03:18.236
Where are the kids?

03:18.237 --> 03:19.704
They got detention, Teddy.

03:19.738 --> 03:21.672
On the day
of the Cotton Candy Festival?

03:21.673 --> 03:23.941
That's rough. Wish I could go,
but I can't trust myself.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.943
You think you're gonna get one,
maybe two cottons,

03:25.944 --> 03:27.578
next thing you know
you're getting kicked out

03:27.579 --> 03:29.547
of the festival, and they take
away your car keys.

03:29.581 --> 03:32.049
Right. Hi, sweetie.
Can I help you?

03:32.084 --> 03:34.085
Hi. Good afternoon.
My name is Sally.

03:34.086 --> 03:35.920
I hope
that you're enjoying your day.

03:35.921 --> 03:38.155
Would you like to buy
some magazine subscriptions

03:38.156 --> 03:40.658
to help me learn
communication skills,

03:40.659 --> 03:42.260
help me buy textbooks,

03:42.261 --> 03:45.229
and send me on a trip
to Turtle Camp in Florida?

03:45.264 --> 03:48.099
I'm only 283 points
away from my goal.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.667
Turtle Camp?
Uh, no, thanks.

03:49.668 --> 03:51.335
We're-we're not interested.
At all.

03:51.336 --> 03:54.171
Aw. I love turtles.
What do you do at camp?

03:54.172 --> 03:57.108
You get in a little canoe
with them? Do turtle crafts?

03:57.142 --> 03:59.143
You can select
up to ten magazines

03:59.144 --> 04:02.613
from any of these titles
for only $17.

04:02.648 --> 04:04.482
That sounds like a great deal.
Where do I sign? (quietly): Fake.

04:04.483 --> 04:06.217
This is fake. Not real.
I'll take a look!

04:06.218 --> 04:07.685
Fake.
Let me see what you got.

04:07.719 --> 04:09.387
<i>Jacuzzi Enthusiast.</i>

04:09.388 --> 04:12.056
Ooh, they got <i> Lotion Monthly.</i>
Ooh. Ooh, ooh.

04:12.057 --> 04:14.892
Aw,<i> Healthy Babies Digest.</i>
Aw...

04:14.893 --> 04:16.793
(quietly): Lin, th-they never
send you the magazines.

04:16.829 --> 04:19.363
You will start receiving issues
within 30 days.

04:19.398 --> 04:20.731
Uh, hold on one second, Sally.

04:20.732 --> 04:23.134
Quick conversation over here
with my wife.

04:23.168 --> 04:25.169
Lin, no.
They have <i>Open-Toe Living.</i>

04:25.170 --> 04:26.470
Linda, it's a scam.

04:26.471 --> 04:28.406
You give them money,
and they just take it.

04:28.407 --> 04:30.308
Sally's a scammer?
Our Sally?

04:30.309 --> 04:33.144
Somebody's scamming her, too.
They put her up to it.

04:33.145 --> 04:34.879
What are we talking
about over here?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.814
Somebody is scamming Sally.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.816
Bastard!
We got to help her.

04:38.817 --> 04:41.152
Or we can just nicely
ask her to leave.

04:41.153 --> 04:43.955
No, Bobby. We lost three kids
to detention today.

04:43.989 --> 04:45.389
We're not losing Sally, too.

04:45.390 --> 04:47.158
(sobs): Sally! What?

04:47.159 --> 04:48.693
Nothing, Sally!
Nothing. Uh, no.

04:48.727 --> 04:50.895
Fashion has become toxic
here at Wagstaff.

04:50.929 --> 04:52.930
Believe it or not,
even I have been the recipient

04:52.931 --> 04:56.000
of what some people call
a "fashion thrashin'."

04:56.001 --> 04:57.135
(urinating)

04:57.169 --> 04:58.536
Wha...

04:58.570 --> 05:00.371
What?!

05:00.405 --> 05:03.040
Wh-What?
"More like sweater mess"?

05:03.075 --> 05:04.509
That night, I was upset.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.344
But instead of lashing out
in anger,

05:06.345 --> 05:07.879
I turned to the needle.

05:07.913 --> 05:09.747
That's right.
The knitting needle.

05:09.748 --> 05:12.483
I rehabilitated myself
with fashion.

05:12.518 --> 05:14.652
That's an emotional-ass story,
Mr. Frond.

05:14.686 --> 05:16.687
Fashion should be
a form of expression,

05:16.688 --> 05:18.523
not a weapon
to tear people down.

05:18.524 --> 05:20.892
That is why I have decided
to team you up

05:20.893 --> 05:23.761
and pitch you against each other
in a fashion contest.

05:23.796 --> 05:25.797
So far, this all makes sense.
Uh, no, thanks.

05:25.798 --> 05:28.566
If you need me, I'll be zoning
out pretty hard over here.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.234
And I'm gonna sleep
with my eyes open.

05:30.235 --> 05:32.570
Like this.
(snoring)

05:32.604 --> 05:35.039
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine!
The winning team will be allowed

05:35.040 --> 05:37.675
to leave detention
three hours early.

05:37.709 --> 05:39.110
Wait, what?
Seriously?

05:39.111 --> 05:41.446
We can go
to the Cotton Candy Festival!

05:41.447 --> 05:44.048
Mr. Frond, you got yourself
a fashion contest.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.851
Welcome to... Scared Fabulous!

05:46.885 --> 05:48.619
(quietly): Hey, Tina.
How about a side bet?

05:48.620 --> 05:50.621
Winner gets to wear
the sparkle jelly bracelet.

05:50.622 --> 05:53.291
Loser has to throw
theirs in the trash.

05:53.325 --> 05:55.626
Deal. We've got
a deal like Ally McBeal.

05:55.661 --> 05:58.629
We've got a deal like
Steven Spiel... berg.

06:00.028 --> 06:02.457
Welcome to Scared Fabulous.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.426
You will divide into teams
and face three challenges.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.294
You'll sketch designs,
collect materials,

06:06.295 --> 06:08.263
and construct outfits
on your CPR dummy.

06:08.297 --> 06:11.867
Good news for us, 'cause that
dummy looks hot in anything.

06:11.868 --> 06:14.369
Then one of you will walk
your design down the runway.

06:14.370 --> 06:15.704
You will have
three impartial judges

06:15.705 --> 06:17.706
with a keen sense of fashion:

06:17.707 --> 06:20.976
<i>Ms. Schnur, Coach Blevins
and Mr. Branca.</i>

06:21.010 --> 06:22.744
What? The big three?

06:22.745 --> 06:24.880
Aren't they all supposed to be
in Milan this week?

06:24.914 --> 06:26.214
They're the only other
faculty members

06:26.215 --> 06:27.549
who happen to be
in the building today.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.351
I'm on Tammy's team!

06:29.352 --> 06:31.520
I want to be on Zeke's team.
Someday we're gonna start

06:31.521 --> 06:33.922
our own men's fashion line
then live in a van!

06:33.923 --> 06:35.757
Yeah! Called Fancy Pants!

06:35.758 --> 06:38.660
You're gonna fance the way
you pants. I guarantee it!

06:38.661 --> 06:40.862
Fine, then. The last team will
be the Belcher kids. There are

06:40.863 --> 06:43.231
three of you, but I don't
really see that as an advantage.

06:43.266 --> 06:45.100
Don't underestimate us.
Our family's motto is,

06:45.101 --> 06:47.102
"Maybe we'll get lucky this
time." I thought it was,

06:47.103 --> 06:49.237
"Stop touching that!
You're getting it all greasy!"

06:49.272 --> 06:51.339
LINDA: How's the burger, Sally?

06:51.374 --> 06:53.375
You like it?
It's fine. Thanks.

06:53.376 --> 06:55.911
So, are you guys gonna
buy any magazines?

06:55.945 --> 06:58.714
No, Sally,
'cause your life is a lie. What?

06:58.715 --> 07:00.048
Linda.
Sorry, Sally.

07:00.049 --> 07:02.284
Uh, what my wife is
trying to say is that

07:02.285 --> 07:03.785
there are no magazines.

07:03.786 --> 07:05.354
You're-you're involved
in a scam.

07:05.355 --> 07:07.089
Somebody is using you.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.524
But I'm only 283 points away
from reaching my goal.

07:09.525 --> 07:11.193
Sally! There are no points!
(gasps)

07:11.227 --> 07:12.427
What?
There is no goal!

07:12.462 --> 07:13.395
But...
There are no turtles!

07:13.429 --> 07:14.363
Oh.
You got to get out!

07:14.364 --> 07:15.263
What happened to the turtles?

07:15.264 --> 07:16.398
Linda, calm down.

07:16.399 --> 07:18.133
I guess I'm gonna get going.

07:18.134 --> 07:20.102
Uh, okay, yeah, but did you get
what we were talking about here?

07:20.103 --> 07:21.503
Give me a quick hug!

07:21.537 --> 07:23.071
We'll, I'm not supposed...
(grunts)

07:23.072 --> 07:25.073
Sally. I got to be on my way,
but, uh...

07:25.074 --> 07:27.075
sorry to, uh...
sorry to, uh...

07:27.076 --> 07:29.945
sorry to, uh...
sorry to bother you.

07:29.979 --> 07:32.314
Bye, Sally.
What a nice girl.

07:32.315 --> 07:34.149
Wait, where's my purse?
My purse!

07:34.150 --> 07:36.318
Oh, there it is.
There it is.

07:36.319 --> 07:37.519
Everything's okay.

07:37.553 --> 07:39.488
My fries!
You ate them, Teddy.

07:39.489 --> 07:41.923
Oh, okay. Can I get another fry
over here please?

07:41.958 --> 07:43.392
MR. FROND:
<i>All right. I just got off</i>

07:43.426 --> 07:45.694
the phone with Principal Spoors'
voicemail.

07:45.728 --> 07:47.496
I feel like the message
went really well,

07:47.497 --> 07:49.398
and I think what
we're looking at here

07:49.399 --> 07:53.235
is a pilot program
that will probably go national.

07:53.236 --> 07:56.071
So, Ms. Schnur, what
is the first challenge?

07:56.105 --> 07:59.441
For my challenge, I want
each team to design an outfit

07:59.442 --> 08:02.978
that I can wear over
a three-day holiday weekend.

08:03.012 --> 08:04.646
All right, Schnur,
what are we talking here?

08:04.647 --> 08:07.649
Martial arts tournament?
Canadian pill run? Antiquing?

08:07.684 --> 08:10.118
No. I'm just gonna sit
on the couch all weekend

08:10.119 --> 08:12.354
and watch a David Schwimmer
movie marathon.

08:12.355 --> 08:16.792
Great! Okay, designers, time to
make her fab while you rehab.

08:16.793 --> 08:19.127
Ms. Schnur wants to sit
on the couch for three days.

08:19.162 --> 08:21.496
Gene, you were born
to design this outfit.

08:21.497 --> 08:22.931
I'm like the Steve Jobs

08:22.932 --> 08:24.666
of sitting on the couch
for three days.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.468
Tina, you can be our model.

08:26.502 --> 08:28.503
Uh, I don't know.
I'm not very good at walking.

08:28.538 --> 08:30.372
You're getting better.
Just keep your head high,

08:30.373 --> 08:33.275
pick your knees up, and make
every step a glamorous stomp.

08:33.308 --> 08:34.643
You mean like a horse?

08:34.677 --> 08:35.644
Mm... yeah.

08:35.678 --> 08:36.878
♪ ♪

08:36.879 --> 08:39.114
(grunting)

08:39.115 --> 08:41.549
Clip-clop, girl!

08:42.619 --> 08:43.852
I'm in.

08:43.852 --> 08:45.287
All right, designers,
you each have

08:45.288 --> 08:47.022
five minutes
to collect your materials.

08:47.023 --> 08:48.957
Are we going to
the fabric store? No!

08:48.958 --> 08:50.692
Oh.
For this challenge,

08:50.693 --> 08:53.629
you can only use materials
from Ms. Schnur's supply closet.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.664
And your time starts... now!

08:55.698 --> 08:56.832
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

09:00.036 --> 09:01.803
Ugh, you copied
my bracelet, Tina,

09:01.804 --> 09:03.705
and now you want
to take my stapler?

09:03.706 --> 09:05.874
Why don't you staple your mouth
shut, 'cause your face keeps

09:05.875 --> 09:07.809
falling open and dumb words
keep coming out.

09:07.810 --> 09:09.044
Mine!

09:09.045 --> 09:10.379
No...!

09:10.380 --> 09:11.680
Oh, there's another one
right here.

09:11.714 --> 09:13.048
MR. FROND:
<i>Welcome to the runway.</i>

09:13.082 --> 09:14.349
As you know in fashion,

09:14.350 --> 09:15.684
one day you're in,

09:15.685 --> 09:18.220
the next day
you're rehabilitated.

09:18.221 --> 09:19.988
And out free in the world
eating cotton candy

09:19.989 --> 09:22.190
to shove it in your face,
the whole thing.

09:22.225 --> 09:23.992
The winner of this challenge
will receive immunity

09:23.993 --> 09:25.727
in the next round.
Let's start the show!

09:25.728 --> 09:27.396
(dance music playing)

09:27.397 --> 09:29.498
(grunting) J-Ju's
wearing the Couch-fit!

09:29.499 --> 09:32.501
For the d... For those days
you just don't want to get off

09:32.502 --> 09:34.336
the couch, now you
don't have to.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.038
'Cause you are the couch.
Spin.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.739
Looking good, girl!

09:37.774 --> 09:39.875
Ha.
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

09:39.876 --> 09:43.178
It doesn't matter if she's out
on the town or in on the couch,

09:43.212 --> 09:46.415
we wanted Ms. Schnur to look fun
and flirty, not gross and dirty.

09:46.416 --> 09:48.417
This is me right now.

09:48.418 --> 09:50.652
And... clip-clop. Clip-clop.

09:50.687 --> 09:52.421
(grunting) Ladies and gentlemen,

09:52.422 --> 09:54.690
I introduce to you
the Adult Bib.

09:54.691 --> 09:56.692
The pockets are lined
with aluminum foil

09:56.693 --> 09:58.327
to keep your chicken wings warm.

09:58.361 --> 10:01.229
(quietly): We got this, Gene.
Tina looks great out there.

10:01.264 --> 10:03.098
Horsey but good.
Ah!

10:03.099 --> 10:05.100
Oh, no! My nephew
through the years!

10:05.101 --> 10:07.269
Oh, nice one, Tina.
Uh, good luck winning

10:07.270 --> 10:09.705
after you ruined
Ms. Schnur's family forever.

10:09.706 --> 10:12.441
Uh...

10:12.442 --> 10:14.343
MR. FROND: <i>Now it's time
to pick a winner and see</i>

10:14.377 --> 10:18.013
who will get immunity and move
directly to the final round.

10:18.047 --> 10:22.017
Zeke, Jimmy Jr., I found
your look incredibly offensive.

10:22.051 --> 10:23.585
I am not a couch.

10:23.586 --> 10:25.087
Tammy, Jocelyn,

10:25.121 --> 10:27.623
your flirty outfit
would send the wrong message

10:27.624 --> 10:30.025
to the Chinese food
delivery guy.

10:30.059 --> 10:33.395
His name is Enrique, and he's
already very forward with me.

10:33.396 --> 10:36.064
Belcher children,
your model fell over

10:36.065 --> 10:38.700
and destroyed
all my photographs of Nathan.

10:38.735 --> 10:41.403
Ms. Schnur, it's time
to announce your decision.

10:41.437 --> 10:43.872
The winner of
this challenge is...

10:43.907 --> 10:47.576
Come on, Schnur. Get us to
that sweet, sweet cotton candy.

10:47.577 --> 10:49.578
...Tammy and Jocelyn.

10:49.612 --> 10:51.013
(groans) Yay! We're popular!

10:51.014 --> 10:52.314
Yes! Yes!

10:52.348 --> 10:53.749
Sparkle jealous, much?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.584
Blah, blah, blah much?
That's you.

10:55.585 --> 10:58.569
I want cotton candy
much! That's me!

10:59.450 --> 11:01.557
Kids, welcome to round two.

11:01.558 --> 11:02.992
Coach Blevins,
tell the designers

11:02.993 --> 11:04.260
about their next challenge.

11:04.294 --> 11:05.728
Uh, I just came in today

11:05.729 --> 11:07.162
to pull up
these old wrestling mats

11:07.163 --> 11:09.665
because they're full
of, uh, blood and spit.

11:09.666 --> 11:10.733
Mm-hmm.

11:10.734 --> 11:11.734
Also, I need

11:11.735 --> 11:13.636
to throw out these jerseys.

11:13.637 --> 11:15.638
They're from the '60s, and they
have high levels of bacteria.

11:15.639 --> 11:17.907
Yeah, but isn't bacteria
just a myth?

11:17.908 --> 11:19.675
So let's just say the materials

11:19.676 --> 11:22.745
for this challenge will be
wrestling mats and old jerseys.

11:22.746 --> 11:25.147
Now, tell them what kind
of outfit you want.

11:25.148 --> 11:28.017
Well, next Saturday, I have
a wrestling meet in the morning,

11:28.018 --> 11:31.120
traffic school in the afternoon
and salsa dancing at night.

11:31.121 --> 11:34.423
So I guess I need an outfit
that's a triple threat:

11:34.457 --> 11:36.592
coaching, getting
my license back, dancing.

11:36.593 --> 11:37.993
You heard the man.

11:37.994 --> 11:39.361
Let's get started, designers.

11:39.362 --> 11:40.763
TAMMY:
Good luck, designer-whiners!

11:40.797 --> 11:42.631
We have immunity!

11:42.632 --> 11:45.267
That means we don't have to
design an outfit this round,

11:45.268 --> 11:46.769
and we can never die.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.238
Just the first thing.
The second thing is incorrect.

11:49.272 --> 11:50.840
(doorbells jingle)
Excuse me. Hi.

11:50.841 --> 11:52.341
Can I help you?

11:52.375 --> 11:55.878
Did you tell this girl
that she was part of a scam?

11:55.879 --> 11:57.880
Um, a little bit?
Who are you?

11:57.881 --> 12:00.683
I'm Trish, and I've been
helping girls like Sally

12:00.684 --> 12:02.785
get communication
skills, textbooks

12:02.786 --> 12:06.288
and trips to Florida
for the last 16 years.

12:06.289 --> 12:07.857
Oh, okay. So you're the one

12:07.858 --> 12:09.592
behind the whole
fake Turtle Camp thing?

12:09.626 --> 12:12.228
Fake Turtle Camp thing?

12:12.229 --> 12:14.196
Do you know what these
girls learn down there?

12:14.197 --> 12:16.799
They learn to come out
of their shell. Yup.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.300
Let me tell you a story, huh?

12:18.301 --> 12:20.169
Once upon a time,
there was a little girl.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.338
And she used to stutter
with a lisp, like this.

12:22.339 --> 12:23.906
Th-th-th-th-th-th-th.

12:23.907 --> 12:25.641
And then she sold magazines
and went to Turtle Camp,

12:25.642 --> 12:27.042
and everything changed.

12:27.043 --> 12:28.544
(gasps) Was it you?

12:28.578 --> 12:30.045
Yes. Let's say yes.

12:30.046 --> 12:32.214
These magazines change lives.

12:32.215 --> 12:34.016
Oh, my God, Bobby,
it's not a scam.

12:34.017 --> 12:36.352
We had it all wrong.
Uh, yeah.

12:36.353 --> 12:38.554
Still think this is
a bunch of crap.

12:38.555 --> 12:40.022
It-it just seems
like you're asking girls

12:40.023 --> 12:41.724
to sell magazines
and then taking the money.

12:41.725 --> 12:44.326
Okay, you know what else
a turtle can do?

12:44.327 --> 12:45.728
Huh? Do you know?

12:45.729 --> 12:47.897
A little turtle,
what can it do, hmm?

12:47.931 --> 12:50.065
It can snap!
Snapping turtles!

12:50.100 --> 12:52.501
So do you want
to see me snap, hmm?

12:52.536 --> 12:54.537
No. Or do you want to
buy some magazines?

12:54.538 --> 12:56.372
(groaning) Calm down.
What are you doing?

12:56.373 --> 12:58.174
Okay, okay, take it easy.

12:58.175 --> 13:00.409
Oh, no! Bobby,
she's pulling up the counter!

13:00.443 --> 13:04.713
Do... you... want to buy
any... magazines?!

13:04.748 --> 13:06.248
Say yes, Bobby! Say yes! Oh!

13:06.283 --> 13:07.750
God, I'm going crazy!

13:07.751 --> 13:09.585
Okay, do you have any
magazines about cooking?

13:09.619 --> 13:10.853
We have <i>Cooking in the Kitchen.</i>

13:10.854 --> 13:12.354
Great. I'll get my checkbook.

13:12.355 --> 13:13.889
Get your checkbook. Get it!
I'm getting it!

13:13.890 --> 13:15.491
Hurry!
I can't find it!

13:15.525 --> 13:17.626
Okay, the designs are complete.

13:17.627 --> 13:20.262
Let's tear them apart
metaphorically.

13:20.263 --> 13:21.697
(grunting)

13:21.698 --> 13:24.099
Coach Blevins will
be sporty and spicy

13:24.100 --> 13:26.302
in this one-piece,
all-day dress shirt.

13:26.303 --> 13:29.405
Mm-hmm. You'll notice the design
is backless, which is perfect

13:29.406 --> 13:31.073
for salsa dancing
and gettinyour license back.

13:31.074 --> 13:32.875
(grunting wildly) Come on!

13:32.909 --> 13:36.278
Zeke is wearing a traditional
Japanese samurai outfit.

13:36.279 --> 13:39.148
'Cause there is nowhere
this outfit doesn't fit in

13:39.149 --> 13:40.916
and stand out.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.551
Coach Blevins, it's time

13:42.552 --> 13:44.253
to announce the winner
of this challenge

13:44.254 --> 13:47.289
and who will face Tammy
and Jocelyn in the final round!

13:47.290 --> 13:49.425
Uh, I honestly don't know
anything about fashion.

13:49.426 --> 13:51.127
Can we just call it a tie?

13:51.128 --> 13:52.728
No, we cannot call it a tie.

13:52.729 --> 13:54.230
It's fashion. There
has to be a winner

13:54.231 --> 13:55.564
and a loser.
Pick one!

13:55.599 --> 13:56.966
Um, maybe

13:56.967 --> 13:58.567
they should just wrestle for it.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.503
That's how I usually
settle things in my gym class.

14:00.504 --> 14:02.938
Fine, then. If that's what it
takes for you to pick a winner,

14:02.939 --> 14:04.306
then we'll have them wrestle.

14:04.341 --> 14:05.407
Wait. What?

14:05.408 --> 14:06.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go!

14:06.676 --> 14:09.111
Yeah! This is my kind
of fashion show!

14:09.112 --> 14:10.813
Gene, get over here!
I'm gonna get ya!

14:10.814 --> 14:12.248
Come on! Come on!

14:12.249 --> 14:13.983
I just ironed this outfit! Aah!

14:14.017 --> 14:16.418
(phone ringing)
Oh, hello, Principal Spoors.

14:16.453 --> 14:18.154
We're right in the middle
of a fashion show.

14:18.155 --> 14:19.855
I assume
you're calling about that?

14:19.856 --> 14:21.323
It's-it's a little
hard to hear you.

14:21.324 --> 14:23.025
Wh-What were you saying?
Stop it!

14:23.026 --> 14:25.528
Oh, you... you what
Scared Fabulous?

14:25.529 --> 14:27.496
You hate it. Okay.

14:27.497 --> 14:29.365
Like, ironically?

14:29.366 --> 14:31.267
Hey, Tina!
You guys are gonna lose!

14:31.268 --> 14:34.003
So bracelet in your facelet
is what I'm talking about!

14:34.004 --> 14:36.172
You want to go, Tammy?
Want to go?! Yeah!

14:36.173 --> 14:37.807
I'd like to talk to you more,
a little more,

14:37.808 --> 14:39.442
about the... Oh. Okay, right.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.645
No morlls on the weekend.
Got it. Right. Bye.

14:41.646 --> 14:44.046
So, designers, I just spoke
with Principal Spoors,

14:44.047 --> 14:45.915
and there have been
some new developments.

14:45.949 --> 14:47.683
Scared Fabulous
will abruptly end now,

14:47.684 --> 14:49.452
and we'll all be
returning to class

14:49.453 --> 14:51.120
where detention
will resume as usual.

14:51.154 --> 14:52.455
ALL: What?!

14:52.456 --> 14:53.489
What about the finals?

14:53.523 --> 14:55.658
And the Cotton Candy Festival!

14:55.659 --> 14:57.460
Whoa, Mr. Frond, hold on.

14:57.494 --> 14:58.794
You're gonna let
Principal Spoors

14:58.795 --> 15:01.363
just shut down
our rehabilitation?

15:01.364 --> 15:03.199
It was a mutual decision.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.167
(chuckles):
Oh, I get what's going on.

15:05.168 --> 15:06.669
He didn't think
you were qualified

15:06.670 --> 15:08.737
to run a fashion-based
at-risk youth program.

15:08.738 --> 15:10.840
Maybe another teacher
will have to do it.

15:10.841 --> 15:13.409
Someone with, say,
a knack for fashion.

15:13.410 --> 15:16.846
Uh, I...
I'm Wagstaff's fashion guy.

15:16.847 --> 15:19.148
I'm a better designer
than all of you combined.

15:19.149 --> 15:20.916
I could sew you under the table.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.085
Oh, really? Well, why don't you
put your knitting needles

15:23.086 --> 15:24.553
where your mouth is?

15:24.554 --> 15:26.989
One last challenge...
all of us against you.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.291
Mr. Branca judges.
Right, Mr. Branca?

15:29.326 --> 15:31.894
I like clean lines
and simple silhouettes.

15:31.928 --> 15:34.363
Ugh. No. I don't want to work
with Tina. I won't do it.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.866
Tammy shush. I'm getting us out of
here. I don't want to work with Tina.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.400
I don't... I...
Stop it! Just shush. Shush!

15:38.401 --> 15:40.336
If you win,
we'll tell Principal Spoors

15:40.337 --> 15:42.238
that you scared us fabulous,

15:42.239 --> 15:44.173
and that you're the best dressed
man we've ever seen.

15:44.174 --> 15:47.176
But if we win, (chuckles)
we all get to leave early.

15:47.177 --> 15:49.545
I'm a knitter, not a quitter.

15:49.546 --> 15:51.547
Kids, you're on.

15:51.548 --> 15:52.948
All right!
Hell yeah!

15:52.949 --> 15:54.250
Oh, my God, yeah!
Let's do it.

15:54.251 --> 15:56.285
You can take
our Saturday morning,

15:56.286 --> 15:58.421
but you'll hopefully
never take away

15:58.422 --> 16:00.746
our mid-to-late
Saturday afternoon!

16:02.199 --> 16:05.034
Let the ultimate
challenge begin.

16:05.068 --> 16:08.270
The fashionista
versus the detentionistas.

16:08.305 --> 16:10.106
I can't believe I have
to work with Tina.

16:10.107 --> 16:11.807
She smells like failure, and her
hair smells like ketchup.

16:11.808 --> 16:13.476
It's not like I want to work
with you, either, Tammy.

16:13.477 --> 16:15.211
And you're wrong.

16:15.212 --> 16:17.046
My hair doesn't smell
like ketchup. My skin does.

16:17.047 --> 16:19.648
Oh. You guys, try to keep it
together for one last challenge.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.083
We'll all get out of here,

16:21.084 --> 16:23.185
and you can hate each other
on the outside.

16:23.220 --> 16:24.653
Let me paint a picture.

16:24.654 --> 16:26.088
I am president
in the old country.

16:26.089 --> 16:27.556
The revolution is underway.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.558
The rebels have charged
into my palace,

16:29.559 --> 16:31.827
dragged me onto the street,
and are demanding justice.

16:31.828 --> 16:33.529
I must give a speech.

16:33.563 --> 16:36.732
I want you to design a look
that will save my life

16:36.733 --> 16:38.467
using a material

16:38.468 --> 16:41.971
that I now work with every day
in your wonderful country.

16:42.005 --> 16:44.473
Trash. You have 20 minutes. Dig!

16:44.508 --> 16:45.608
Let's go!
Let's go!

16:45.642 --> 16:47.643
BOB: So what do we owe you?

16:47.677 --> 16:49.178
Let's call it $160.

16:49.179 --> 16:50.679
Hmm. That's not how
much magazines cost.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.048
(doorbells jingle)
JIMMY: Hey, Bob.

16:52.082 --> 16:53.416
Just wanted to
check how many kids

16:53.417 --> 16:55.351
you were gonna be
picking up from detention.

16:55.352 --> 16:58.521
Still three? Not now, Jimmy. We're
in the middle of something here.

16:58.522 --> 17:01.057
Yeah? What are you talking
about? What are you doing?

17:01.091 --> 17:03.592
You know what? Just... Nah,
you-you wouldn't be interested.

17:03.627 --> 17:05.327
Ha! Yeah, you're right.

17:05.328 --> 17:08.097
But, uh, you know, tell me
so I can not be interested.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.964
Well, we were just using
some of our profits

17:09.965 --> 17:12.134
to help Sally here
with her textbooks

17:12.135 --> 17:14.136
and communication skills
and Turtle Camp.

17:14.137 --> 17:15.604
Just some philanthropy.

17:15.605 --> 17:17.006
You know, giving back
to the community.

17:17.007 --> 17:18.406
We bought 20
magazine subscriptions,

17:18.442 --> 17:19.809
but it's not a big deal.

17:19.810 --> 17:21.176
Nothing you'd be interested in.

17:21.211 --> 17:23.612
20? That's dumb.
I could buy 40.

17:23.646 --> 17:24.780
I don't think you could.

17:24.815 --> 17:26.115
Oh, yeah, I could easily.

17:26.116 --> 17:27.849
I give back
like a son of a bitch.

17:27.884 --> 17:29.618
Hey, uh, why don't
you guys come over

17:29.619 --> 17:31.220
to my place after
you're done here?

17:31.221 --> 17:32.955
I'll take two of everything.

17:32.989 --> 17:35.291
Whoa! Yes, sir!
You got it.

17:35.325 --> 17:36.859
♪ Ha-da doo-dee. ♪

17:36.893 --> 17:38.361
You should receive
your first issues

17:38.362 --> 17:40.329
in ten to 12 to 18 weeks, huh?

17:40.330 --> 17:41.831
Okay, thanks for
your support. Bye!

17:41.832 --> 17:43.799
And I'll send you a postcard
from Turtle Camp.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.635
Aw, I hope you do, Sally.
I really hope you do.

17:46.670 --> 17:48.304
Me, too.
I hope I do it, too.

17:48.305 --> 17:49.372
Bye. Love you, Sally!

17:49.373 --> 17:51.040
Okay, thank-thank you.

17:51.041 --> 17:52.508
Today was a good day.

17:52.509 --> 17:54.877
Yeah. We got screwed,
but Jimmy got screwed more.

17:54.878 --> 17:56.212
Yeah.

17:56.213 --> 17:57.646
I found some cucumber.

17:57.647 --> 17:59.615
Maybe we can make
a cucumber-bund?

17:59.650 --> 18:01.183
Come on, Philip.

18:01.184 --> 18:03.386
It's time to prove yourself
to the world.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.821
Let's make something Fronderful!

18:07.424 --> 18:09.158
Aah, we're out of peanut butter!

18:09.192 --> 18:10.593
Where are we gonna
find something

18:10.594 --> 18:12.962
that can wrap around
a human wrist? Hey.

18:12.996 --> 18:15.164
What if Tina and Tammy each
threw away their bracelets?

18:15.165 --> 18:17.133
Then we could use them
to hold up the lettuce.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.868
Great idea J-Ju!
Thanks, Zeke!

18:18.902 --> 18:22.071
No way. My sparkle jelly
stays on my wrist until I die,

18:22.072 --> 18:23.706
and then
probably even after that.

18:23.707 --> 18:25.207
Tina can throw hers away.

18:25.208 --> 18:26.676
Why don't we throw Tammy away?

18:26.677 --> 18:28.577
(girls shrieking, grunting)

18:28.578 --> 18:30.046
Come on, girls!

18:30.047 --> 18:31.647
Work together for God's sake!

18:31.682 --> 18:33.516
Guys, we're gonna lose!

18:33.517 --> 18:36.018
We're supposed to be at the
Cotton Candy Festival right now,

18:36.019 --> 18:38.254
and instead we're standing
in a freaking Dumpster!

18:38.255 --> 18:41.557
They're just stupid
sparkle jelly bracelets!

18:41.591 --> 18:43.192
They're not stupid!
They're made of rubber,

18:43.193 --> 18:44.894
and they have
a little charm on them,

18:44.895 --> 18:46.262
and they define who you are.

18:46.296 --> 18:47.863
Oh, my God, they <i> are</i> stupid.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.732
I don't need
this sparkle jelly to dazzle.

18:49.733 --> 18:51.600
I dazzle on my own.
We all do.

18:51.601 --> 18:53.002
Except for Tammy.

18:53.036 --> 18:54.904
How sure are
we that this is peanut butter?

18:54.905 --> 18:56.639
'Cause it's starting to burn.
Sorry to interrupt.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.107
Go on with what you were saying.

18:58.108 --> 18:59.842
Tammy, these bracelets
are what got us in here.

18:59.876 --> 19:01.644
Let's use them
to get us out of here.

19:01.645 --> 19:03.646
I'm throwing mine away.

19:04.781 --> 19:06.182
Thanks, T.

19:06.216 --> 19:07.550
Tammy, now you throw away
your bracelet.

19:07.551 --> 19:09.151
We need it
to hold up the other arm.

19:09.152 --> 19:10.252
What do you say, Tammy?

19:12.222 --> 19:14.390
Let the fashion show begin!

19:14.391 --> 19:15.391
♪ ♪

19:15.392 --> 19:17.593
(grunting)

19:19.730 --> 19:21.297
This is my design.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.466
It is a slim-fitted
European-style suit.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.934
Apparently, Hildy the lunch lady

19:24.935 --> 19:26.402
cuts her hair
in the parking lot,

19:26.403 --> 19:29.171
which I have used
to make a fur lapel.

19:29.172 --> 19:31.407
(grunting)

19:31.408 --> 19:35.077
This is our fresh new design
made of not-so-fresh lettuce.

19:35.112 --> 19:37.747
It's a tailored suit, perfect
for a summertime wedding,

19:37.748 --> 19:39.415
or a summertime revolution.

19:39.416 --> 19:41.584
Mmm!

19:41.585 --> 19:44.520
Designers, I am impressed.

19:44.521 --> 19:46.856
Both teams did an excellent job
making my trash suit.

19:46.857 --> 19:49.659
Mr. Frond, your outfit had class

19:49.660 --> 19:51.294
and sass. Kids,

19:51.295 --> 19:52.495
the tailored fit
around the wrists

19:52.496 --> 19:54.730
of my lettuce suit
was impeccable!

19:54.765 --> 19:56.999
We can easily change it
to peccable if you prefer.

19:57.034 --> 19:59.602
But there was a clear winner.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.107
The kids!

20:05.142 --> 20:06.776
(cheering, excited chatter)
What?!

20:06.777 --> 20:09.145
Mr. Branca,
there must be some mistake.

20:11.114 --> 20:12.682
Wait. Did Tina and Tammy

20:12.683 --> 20:15.017
give up their bracelets
to secure your sleeves?

20:15.052 --> 20:17.787
Did you...
collaborate on fashion

20:17.788 --> 20:20.456
and build a bridge
to friendship and understanding?

20:20.457 --> 20:22.091
We sure did, Mr. Frond.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.027
Let it go, Tammy!
No! Never! Never! Never!

20:25.028 --> 20:28.297
I'll take your arm off
with it if I have to!

20:28.298 --> 20:30.800
Maybe I <i> did</i> rehabilitate
you kids after all.

20:30.801 --> 20:32.201
Yeah, maybe.

20:34.338 --> 20:35.738
Ah! I missed you, outside world!

20:35.739 --> 20:37.139
What year is it?!
