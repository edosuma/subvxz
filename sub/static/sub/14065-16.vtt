<i>Previously on ‘Boston Legal’…</i>

00:01.282 --> 00:02.143
Bethany!

00:02.143 --> 00:04.731
I never want to see you again.

00:04.731 --> 00:06.733
–I dumped your mother.
–You dumped Bella?

00:06.733 --> 00:07.893
'Cause I can't get over you.

00:07.893 --> 00:10.102
–It's my baby.
–It's my choice, not yours.

00:10.102 --> 00:11.196
Have you thought about schools yet?

00:11.196 --> 00:13.331
You have to start applying early
for these pre-schools.

00:13.331 --> 00:17.423
I've been working very hard to
deal with my Asperger syndrome.

00:18.176 --> 00:20.591
Litigation is about confidence.

00:20.591 --> 00:22.834
How did you feel when you were
beating him with the club?

00:22.834 --> 00:25.144
No, you don't want to say that.
Strategy.

00:25.144 --> 00:26.222
Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

00:26.222 --> 00:28.449
–Cheap theatrics.
–Bingo!

00:28.449 --> 00:30.297
To friendship, my colleague.

00:42.018 --> 00:43.469
Hey, hey.

00:44.238 --> 00:45.672
My client lives here.

00:45.672 --> 00:48.460
Would you mind telling me
what the problem is?

00:48.460 --> 00:51.847
I can see it's clearly an emergency.

00:51.847 --> 00:53.635
We're just waiting for
the warrant to come through.

00:53.635 --> 00:55.017
She could've chosen
to cooperate with us.

00:55.017 --> 00:55.992
She didn't want to do that.

00:55.992 --> 00:58.111
She's suspected of wrongdoing?

00:58.111 --> 01:00.555
She stole some art from a museum.

01:01.196 --> 01:03.306
Art? I would hardly call it art.

01:03.306 --> 01:05.486
But you did steal something?

01:05.486 --> 01:07.893
You can't let them search
my house, Alan. You just can't.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.277
Maureen, what's going on?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.292
Can't you just make them
go away for an hour

01:11.292 --> 01:13.760
No. Assuming they can show cause,
they'll get their warrant,

01:13.760 --> 01:16.548
and judging from their demeanor,
they seem confident.

01:16.548 --> 01:19.877
Maureen, what's going on?

01:19.877 --> 01:21.730
It's an anatomical exhibition.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.042
One of the most popular
touring exhibits in the world,

01:24.042 --> 01:27.292
currently on display
at the natural science museum.

01:27.292 --> 01:28.746
This man was a drunkard.

01:28.746 --> 01:31.157
You can tell by the liver.
It's been ravaged.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.706
He also suffered from
some form of venereal disease,

01:33.706 --> 01:37.364
which has caused some sort of
deterioration of some other organs,

01:37.364 --> 01:41.237
I guess, if you know what to look for.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.647
And aside from beautifully
complementing your credenza,

01:44.647 --> 01:47.411
why is he in your dining room?

01:47.411 --> 01:49.277
That's my father.

QA: ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ

02:20.775 --> 02:23.283
I knew someone in maintenance
at the museum.

02:23.283 --> 02:25.199
I went in with the cleaning crew at night.

02:25.199 --> 02:27.461
I just put him on a hand dolly,
and I took him.

02:27.461 --> 02:28.572
The goal being?

02:28.572 --> 02:31.742
To bury him. To give him
a dignified resting place.

02:31.742 --> 02:34.865
Well, Maureen, the only thing
to do is surrender yourself.

02:34.865 --> 02:37.658
The police aren't going anywhere,
and once the search warrant is issued…

02:37.658 --> 02:39.660
Will I go to jail?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.107
You might.

02:44.361 --> 02:47.020
How did he end up like this
in the first place?

02:47.020 --> 02:49.999
My mother donated him upon his death.

02:49.999 --> 02:53.400
I mean, it's perverse, Alan.
Look at him, for God's sake.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.445
Well, he certainly seems happy.

02:56.445 --> 02:59.468
They have no right
to display him like that.

02:59.468 --> 03:02.669
Maureen, you need to surrender
both yourself and dad here.

03:02.669 --> 03:07.751
My best chance of keeping you out of jail
is for you to cooperate completely.

03:27.192 --> 03:28.894
It is almost 11 o'clock.

03:28.894 --> 03:31.030
Thank you, Paul.
I won't have to check my sundial.

03:31.030 --> 03:34.326
We had a 9 o'clock conference call
with our former governor, no less.

03:34.326 --> 03:36.593
I'm sure you had a good reason
for blowing him off.

03:36.593 --> 03:37.609
I did, actually.

03:37.609 --> 03:40.384
One of my clients stole
her dead father from a museum.

03:40.384 --> 03:42.239
I'm sure you've had it
happen to you, Paul.

03:42.239 --> 03:44.161
Please extend my apologies to Mitch.

03:44.161 --> 03:47.821
It's Mitt! –Alan, there's a man
in your office.

03:47.821 --> 03:50.275
I tried to get him
to wait outside, but, uh…

03:50.275 --> 03:51.837
What sort of man, Clarence?

03:51.837 --> 03:53.500
A very serious one.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.242
Did the man say what he wanted?

03:55.242 --> 03:57.678
You.
That's all he'd tell me.

03:57.678 --> 04:00.399
I could have a go at him
as Clarice if you'd like.

04:00.399 --> 04:02.476
That won't be necessary.

04:06.816 --> 04:07.811
Hello.

04:07.811 --> 04:09.182
Uh, good morning, sir.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.225
My name is Dr Alvin Azinabinacroft.

04:12.225 --> 04:15.423
And first I want to thank you very much
for taking the time to see me.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.302
I didn't take the time.
You planted yourself like a squatter.

04:18.302 --> 04:20.464
Seeing you was unavoidable.

04:20.464 --> 04:23.146
I'm here on a matter
of rather grave concern.

04:23.146 --> 04:24.172
Not to me.

04:24.172 --> 04:26.497
I am a cognitive therapist.

04:26.497 --> 04:29.706
I work in the psychology department
at Boston Memorial.

04:29.706 --> 04:34.102
I've recently been discharged
from my employ, wrongfully.

04:34.102 --> 04:37.175
This has been a major personal setback,
it goes without saying.

04:37.175 --> 04:39.244
And yet, you say it.

04:39.244 --> 04:42.638
You come to me highly,
highly recommended.

04:42.638 --> 04:45.414
Here's a copy of my curriculum vitae.

04:45.414 --> 04:47.562
I've been published,
lectured at Harvard.

04:47.562 --> 04:49.461
I'm preeminent.
–And humble.

04:49.461 --> 04:55.325
For me to have been discharged wrongfully
damages my name, my reputation, career.

04:55.325 --> 04:57.048
Why were you discharged, doctor…

04:57.048 --> 04:58.799
Azinabinacroft.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.331
No, really.

05:01.331 --> 05:02.739
Will you represent me?

05:02.739 --> 05:04.487
Why were you fired?

05:04.487 --> 05:07.391
Because I've seen extraterrestrial life.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.572
Who hasn't?

05:09.572 --> 05:11.510
And your employers
now consider you…

05:11.510 --> 05:13.685
–Cuckoo.
–Are you, doctor…

05:13.685 --> 05:15.410
Azinabinacroft.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.964
The answer is no.

05:17.964 --> 05:20.088
They're out there, Mr Shore.

05:20.088 --> 05:21.847
I've seen them.

05:26.442 --> 05:28.244
–Get out of my way.
–Hey, hey, hey!

05:28.244 --> 05:30.254
Pedestrian, right of way.

05:49.703 --> 05:51.021
What are you doing?

05:51.021 --> 05:52.761
Alan's got two cases at once.

05:52.761 --> 05:54.363
I'm going to court with him.

05:54.363 --> 05:56.401
You need something?
–Uh, yeah.

05:56.401 --> 06:00.791
I was wondering if you'd let me
cook you dinner tomorrow night.

06:00.791 --> 06:02.624
Sounds great.

06:03.402 --> 06:07.764
And I was wondering
if maybe after dinner,

06:07.764 --> 06:10.219
you'd like to stay.

06:14.310 --> 06:16.421
Uh, stay?

06:16.421 --> 06:18.337
Overnight.

06:22.252 --> 06:25.420
Temple? That would make me
seem like a Jew.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.304
I'm a Jew, Denny.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.150
Temple is a part of my life,

06:29.150 --> 06:31.066
and if you want to be
a big part of my life…

06:31.066 --> 06:34.582
But I'm a Christian,
and to Christians, temple is…

06:34.582 --> 06:37.358
a college.
–My faith is very important to me.

06:37.358 --> 06:39.378
–As mine is to me.
–Oh, please.

06:39.378 --> 06:40.978
What denomination are you?

06:40.978 --> 06:43.752
I'm, uh…

06:43.752 --> 06:46.079
Lutheran.
–I see.

06:46.079 --> 06:48.248
And what do Lutherans
believe in, Denny?

06:48.248 --> 06:50.043
We believe in a great
many things, Bethany.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.697
But mostly we believe…

06:52.697 --> 06:55.059
in, uh, Luther.

06:55.059 --> 06:57.919
Denny, let me say this
as your girlfriend,

06:57.919 --> 07:00.322
i.e. senior management:

07:00.322 --> 07:02.494
You're going to temple.

07:02.494 --> 07:03.912
She stole what?

07:03.912 --> 07:05.482
A plastinized body.

07:05.482 --> 07:07.328
It's part of an anatomical exhibition.

07:07.328 --> 07:08.646
This is a real body?

07:08.646 --> 07:10.939
It's property,
on consignment to the museum.

07:10.939 --> 07:11.927
It's her father.

07:11.927 --> 07:13.468
Property that was legally transferred…

07:13.468 --> 07:16.969
Stop calling him property!
He is a human being.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.966
All right. Do you want a trial?

07:18.966 --> 07:19.773
Yes, your honor.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.964
Two actually, in case
the first one doesn't go well.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.297
–Pick a date.
–I'm ready now.

07:25.297 --> 07:26.746
Mr Beedle?

07:26.746 --> 07:29.030
–Sure.
–After lunch. 2 o'clock.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.327
See you.

07:31.388 --> 07:34.988
–Alan, we gotta fly.
–We'll see you at 2.

07:36.559 --> 07:38.117
He saw aliens?

07:38.117 --> 07:39.597
Uh, no, not aliens, your honor.

07:39.597 --> 07:42.377
Just their, uh, mode of transportation.
The point is,

07:42.377 --> 07:46.670
it bears no reflection on his ability
to perform as a cognitive therapist.

07:46.670 --> 07:51.442
To terminate—
–Were they green with, uh, big eyes?

07:51.442 --> 07:54.615
Your honor, he did not see
the occupants of the craft.

07:54.615 --> 07:59.025
Simply the… –Little antennae
growing on their heads?

07:59.025 --> 08:00.128
Good morning, your honor.

08:00.128 --> 08:02.477
Jerry Espenson representing
Boston Memorial.

08:02.477 --> 08:06.259
Please note my objection that respondent
did not receive notice of this proceeding,

08:06.259 --> 08:07.918
and as such, I would ask that you…

08:07.918 --> 08:10.898
–Jerry.
–Alan! Oh, my God.

08:10.898 --> 08:13.537
Oh, I had no idea
you were opposing counsel.

08:13.537 --> 08:16.320
Nor I you.
You represent Boston Memorial?

08:16.320 --> 08:18.281
My practice is going very well.

08:18.281 --> 08:20.801
I changed medications.
Did you not get my e-mail?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.921
I did, but, Jerry, wow!

08:22.921 --> 08:25.793
This is a huge client.

08:26.191 --> 08:28.655
Why are the lawyers hugging?

08:28.655 --> 08:31.549
Your honor, opposing counsel
and I are good friends.

08:31.549 --> 08:33.227
Given that, notice, Alan?

08:33.227 --> 08:34.725
–It's ex parte.
–Fair enough.

08:34.725 --> 08:36.456
You look fantastic.

08:36.456 --> 08:37.453
Stop it.

08:37.453 --> 08:40.717
I won't have happiness in my courtroom.

08:40.717 --> 08:43.294
Your honor, the termination
was entirely lawful.

08:43.294 --> 08:46.205
Dr Azinabinacroft
has lost touch with reality.

08:46.205 --> 08:49.273
I would like to question the person
who decided to fire him.

08:49.273 --> 08:50.587
Fair enough. This afternoon?

08:50.587 --> 08:53.312
Well, I'm already in trial at 2.

08:53.312 --> 08:54.785
Uh, could we do it at 3?

08:54.785 --> 08:56.417
–3 works.
–3 o'clock then.

08:56.417 --> 08:59.129
Silence!
I get to decide.

08:59.129 --> 09:02.316
You two huggers don't
get to make the rules.

09:02.316 --> 09:05.083
I'm the decider.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.896
3 o'clock.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.374
Hey.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.352
Hey.

09:22.545 --> 09:24.971
Who was that girl I just saw
leaving your office?

09:24.971 --> 09:28.369
She was, uh, pretty cute.

09:28.369 --> 09:30.371
Oh, just a friend.

09:30.371 --> 09:32.149
Just a friend?

09:32.408 --> 09:34.001
You, you dating her?

09:34.001 --> 09:36.405
Uh, yes, actually.

09:36.405 --> 09:37.808
It's not going anywhere, but…

09:37.808 --> 09:40.786
It's a good rattle
just the same, I bet, huh?

09:40.995 --> 09:43.231
Excuse me? –Do you really think
it's appropriate, Brad?

09:43.231 --> 09:45.542
Getting one girl knocked up
while you're dating another?

09:45.542 --> 09:47.980
What? –Did you not hear me?
Am I being too subtle?

09:47.980 --> 09:49.878
No, Denise. You're being
anything but subtle.

09:49.878 --> 09:52.936
And then bringing her into the office,
that's really classy.

09:52.936 --> 09:55.043
You should just parade her
right into my office.

09:55.043 --> 10:00.087
You two could do a little Shawne Merriman
sack dance, you insensitive pig.

10:02.092 --> 10:04.044
So any hormones kicking in
with this pregnancy,

10:04.044 --> 10:06.309
or is everything sort of even-keel?

10:06.309 --> 10:09.734
Why don't you just go
have sex with yourself, Brad?

10:10.049 --> 10:12.071
Is that too subtle?

10:15.790 --> 10:17.242
How's it going?

10:22.632 --> 10:25.264
Nathan very much wanted to
be an organ donor,

10:25.264 --> 10:28.309
but given the condition of his body,
he wasn't a candidate.

10:28.309 --> 10:31.198
But you were the one who
donated the body to the project.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.450
Yes.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.680
Can you tell us why?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.404
Well, the intent of the exhibition,

10:37.404 --> 10:41.333
to educate people on the human body,
not just the physiology,

10:41.333 --> 10:44.861
but also the influence
on the body by lifestyle choice.

10:44.861 --> 10:48.424
That's something that definitely
would've appealed to Nathan.

10:48.424 --> 10:50.829
When he explored being an organ donor,

10:50.829 --> 10:53.431
he wanted his remains to benefit others.

10:53.431 --> 10:56.818
Being a part of this exhibition
would've accomplished that.

10:56.818 --> 11:00.615
That's why I donated the body.

11:00.831 --> 11:03.335
So you never had the exact conversation,

11:03.335 --> 11:06.371
“honey, how would you feel
about having your body put on display,”

11:06.371 --> 11:10.256
“skinless to be showcased
as a drunk with venereal disease?”

11:10.256 --> 11:11.364
As I said,

11:11.364 --> 11:14.875
it's my belief he would've wanted
his remains to benefit others.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.866
According to your daughter,
he was a fairly private man.

11:17.866 --> 11:19.690
Is that true?
–Yes.

11:19.690 --> 11:21.119
You think, as a private man,

11:21.119 --> 11:23.772
he would've been fine with having
his body put on display,

11:23.772 --> 11:25.954
skinless, as a drunk
with venereal disease?

11:25.954 --> 11:29.265
I think he'd be happy to know
his final legacy was selfless.

11:29.265 --> 11:31.280
“Selfless”?

11:31.280 --> 11:33.153
Did he love his children?

11:33.153 --> 11:34.296
Very much.

11:34.296 --> 11:36.462
You think had he known
that it would hurt them,

11:36.462 --> 11:38.347
having his body put on display,

11:38.347 --> 11:40.192
skinless, as a drunk
with venereal disease…

11:40.192 --> 11:41.568
He didn't know that, nor did I.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.656
–Exposed in death as a degenerate.
–That's how he lived.

11:44.656 --> 11:47.803
Maybe people should see how he…

11:54.686 --> 11:59.292
Your husband hurt you a great deal,
didn't he, Mrs Fleming?

11:59.292 --> 12:01.379
This isn't about that.

12:01.379 --> 12:03.888
It isn't about hurting him?

12:06.190 --> 12:11.601
Well, if it is, you've certainly
accomplished that, haven't you?

12:21.887 --> 12:24.911
Do you want to tell me
what that was all about?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.632
Brad, we may not be a couple,
but I am having your baby,

12:27.632 --> 12:29.850
which the entire office knows.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.294
As such, it is completely humiliating

12:32.294 --> 12:35.617
when you prance these trophy girls
around in front of everyone.

12:35.617 --> 12:37.419
I want to be a couple.

12:37.419 --> 12:39.452
We are not even remotely
compatible as a couple,

12:39.452 --> 12:41.594
as evidenced by your preference

12:41.594 --> 12:44.466
for that airheaded, airbrushed bimbo
you brought in here.

12:44.466 --> 12:46.318
My preference is you.

12:46.318 --> 12:48.498
Denise, you cite my values
as an obstacle.

12:48.498 --> 12:49.585
What are your values?

12:49.585 --> 12:51.517
This friends with benefits thing?

12:51.517 --> 12:53.242
What are your values, Denise?

12:53.242 --> 12:56.044
You get engaged to a guy who buys
body parts on a black market,

12:56.044 --> 12:57.590
who corrupts cancer studies.

12:57.590 --> 12:58.732
What are your values?

12:58.732 --> 13:00.893
You sleep with Jeffrey Coho,
a man you don't even like.

13:00.893 --> 13:02.617
And let's not forget the policeman
you did last year

13:02.617 --> 13:04.663
to get out of a parking ticket.

13:07.223 --> 13:08.719
Okay.

13:09.782 --> 13:12.463
You're lost.
–No.

13:12.463 --> 13:14.534
I'm scared.

13:14.534 --> 13:17.336
I am alone and
I am having a baby,

13:17.336 --> 13:21.424
and I am completely alone.

13:22.066 --> 13:24.163
By your choice.

13:32.949 --> 13:35.140
And you've been able
to confirm all of this?

13:35.140 --> 13:38.024
Yes. I sourced it all on the back page.

13:38.024 --> 13:41.223
Excellent.
Excellent work, Clarence.

13:41.223 --> 13:43.112
What's wrong?

13:44.230 --> 13:45.357
Clarence?

13:45.357 --> 13:47.817
Clarence, what's wrong?

13:47.817 --> 13:49.531
Well, uh…

13:50.391 --> 13:53.266
Claire asked me to stay over.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.928
I see.

13:54.928 --> 13:58.166
Well, you have strong feelings
for Claire, don't you?

13:58.166 --> 13:59.808
Very strong.

13:59.808 --> 14:01.749
I think I love her.

14:01.937 --> 14:05.056
But, but I've never…

14:07.065 --> 14:09.475
I'm not sure I'll, uh…

14:09.475 --> 14:11.904
Clarence, um…

14:13.532 --> 14:17.335
the thing about making love
for the first time,

14:17.335 --> 14:19.979
it'll happen when it's right.
And when it's right,

14:19.979 --> 14:23.836
everything just happens naturally.

14:24.762 --> 14:26.878
You couldn't think of anything to say.

14:26.878 --> 14:28.982
I just went blank.

14:30.626 --> 14:35.356
He's an enormously gifted therapist,
an invaluable asset to our clinic.

14:35.356 --> 14:36.466
But?

14:36.466 --> 14:39.757
We're in the business of helping
people cope with reality.

14:39.757 --> 14:42.248
He needs to be in touch with his.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.742
He's telling his clients

14:43.742 --> 14:47.203
that there are aliens out there
monitoring us.

14:47.203 --> 14:48.739
Uh, hold on a second.

14:48.739 --> 14:51.512
Uh, there's no smoking in here.

14:51.512 --> 14:53.319
It's wooden, judge.
Not real.

14:53.319 --> 14:55.556
It's a proprioceptive tool.
–A what?

14:55.556 --> 14:57.452
Relaxation technique.
Never mind.

14:57.452 --> 15:00.761
You just sit there and judge.
I won't actually smoke it.

15:00.761 --> 15:03.625
You said you asked him to stop
talking about the UFO.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.639
Over and over.
He said he could not.

15:05.639 --> 15:10.320
He said that once one actually sees
an extraterrestrial spacecraft,

15:10.320 --> 15:13.995
one has to rethink what he thinks
about the world and our place in it,

15:13.995 --> 15:15.992
what it means to be human.

15:15.992 --> 15:18.961
Thank you. Pass the witness.
Reserve the right to recall.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.650
Go ahead, Alan.

15:34.833 --> 15:38.455
Did you fire him for seeing the UFO
or talking about it?

15:38.455 --> 15:42.119
He was discharged primarily
for discussing it with his patients.

15:42.119 --> 15:46.376
But obviously the fact that he
is convinced that he saw it…

15:46.376 --> 15:49.027
You don't believe he really saw it.

15:49.027 --> 15:50.421
No, I don't.

15:50.421 --> 15:53.378
I suppose if there really was a UFO

15:53.378 --> 15:56.434
hovering above O'Hare
airport last November,

15:56.434 --> 15:59.001
Dr Azinabinacroft
would get his job back.

15:59.001 --> 15:59.949
Well…

15:59.949 --> 16:02.457
He wouldn't be out of touch
with reality then, would he?

16:02.457 --> 16:04.590
I'm sorry. I'd like to
point out for the court

16:04.590 --> 16:06.867
that counsel is very tricky.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.723
And I would ask your honor
that he be noted as such.

16:09.723 --> 16:12.536
He is a profound trickster,
it must be said.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.308
I say it with affection.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.022
Continue.

16:26.910 --> 16:30.222
If you were satisfied that
Dr Azinabinacroft did see

16:30.222 --> 16:32.799
an unidentified flying object
in Chicago that night,

16:32.799 --> 16:37.168
you would have to revisit your decision,
wouldn't you, sir?

16:38.057 --> 16:40.128
Well, I guess I would have to.

16:40.128 --> 16:41.968
I suppose the explanation is simple.

16:41.968 --> 16:46.035
The spacecraft traveled
5 billion light-years to Earth

16:46.035 --> 16:49.336
and then left because of
all the airport hassle.

16:49.336 --> 16:52.468
I mean, who needs that, really?

17:05.152 --> 17:07.344
So you want to prove the UFO is real?

17:07.344 --> 17:10.240
It seems like the obvious thing to do.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.460
I think Jerry could beat me on this.

17:12.460 --> 17:16.522
He's got this newfound confidence.

17:16.522 --> 17:19.064
I was abducted once.

17:19.064 --> 17:22.907
I can't be sure.
It felt like a dream, only more real.

17:22.907 --> 17:24.268
What happened?

17:24.268 --> 17:25.958
Well, uh…

17:25.958 --> 17:30.055
these aliens in the form of Ann Margret
took me to their spacecraft

17:30.055 --> 17:31.825
and had sex with me.

17:31.825 --> 17:34.901
I'm gonna go with dream on that one.

17:34.901 --> 17:37.159
I've gotta go to temple tomorrow.

17:37.159 --> 17:38.699
Bethany's making me.

17:38.699 --> 17:39.769
On a Wednesday?

17:39.769 --> 17:43.271
Yeah, it's a Tu B'shvat
or something like that.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.350
Jewish arbor day.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.429
I gotta wear a beanie.

17:47.429 --> 17:49.499
The things we do for love.

17:49.499 --> 17:51.376
Alan, you called me?

17:51.376 --> 17:52.760
I did.

17:53.536 --> 17:58.798
And on a rather delicate matter that
would ordinarily be none of my business.

17:58.798 --> 18:02.812
Try anything with me,
I'll sever your favorite appendage.

18:02.812 --> 18:08.281
Clarence is extremely anxious that
his appendage will be called into service.

18:08.281 --> 18:12.725
He seems as if he's about to
retreat into Clarice again,

18:12.725 --> 18:16.081
and I just thought you should know.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.411
Thank you.

18:25.568 --> 18:28.375
Do you think Bethany could be an alien?

18:41.327 --> 18:43.900
–Off to court again?
–Yeah.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.129
Clarence,

18:45.129 --> 18:48.236
Alan intimated to me that
you intimated to him

18:48.236 --> 18:52.044
that you were nervous
about staying at my place tonight.

18:52.044 --> 18:55.311
Look, the best thing about
being in a relationship

18:55.311 --> 18:58.379
is having somebody
to share your fears with.

18:58.379 --> 19:01.610
–Even that one?
–Especially that one.

19:01.610 --> 19:05.566
Just talk to me. Okay?

19:06.401 --> 19:08.007
Okay.

19:08.782 --> 19:12.019
I know that he didn't live
a particularly dignified life,

19:12.019 --> 19:15.625
but he was a man of dignity.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.082
And to be exhibited like that,

19:18.082 --> 19:22.448
so that the whole world can see his,
his ravaged liver and organs

19:22.448 --> 19:26.381
while he's holding
a liquor bottle and smiling?

19:26.698 --> 19:29.246
Nobody deserves that.

19:30.347 --> 19:34.900
You do realize that this decision
legally belonged to your mother?

19:34.900 --> 19:37.593
No, legally, she was to do
what he wanted.

19:37.593 --> 19:41.272
This was not his wish.
He would never…

19:44.537 --> 19:47.299
Oh, for God sakes, mom.

19:47.299 --> 19:52.770
Couldn't you at least allow him to find
a little redemption in death?

19:53.588 --> 19:55.412
Do you go to church, Ms Fleming?

19:55.412 --> 19:56.272
I do.

19:56.272 --> 19:57.869
–Do you believe in heaven?
–Of course.

19:57.869 --> 19:59.808
Do you think your father
is in heaven right now?

19:59.808 --> 20:01.794
–Objection.
–Overruled.

20:01.794 --> 20:05.982
Do you believe your dad is in heaven?

20:05.982 --> 20:07.977
I don't know. I hope so.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.306
Was your father a religious man?

20:10.754 --> 20:12.667
–No.
–Did he believe in God?

20:12.667 --> 20:15.094
–Objection.
–Overruled.

20:15.094 --> 20:19.431
Did he believe in God or heaven?

20:20.631 --> 20:22.421
No, he didn't.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.665
So this is more about what you want.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.708
I have been thinking
about what you said.

20:36.708 --> 20:38.755
And, um…

20:38.755 --> 20:42.667
in an ideal world, I would live
with the father of my child.

20:42.667 --> 20:47.649
Toward that, I feel I owe it to my child
to at least explore the…

20:47.649 --> 20:50.871
possibility of…

20:56.126 --> 20:59.193
I want us to see a couples therapist

20:59.193 --> 21:02.308
to get a professional prognosis
as to our…

21:02.308 --> 21:06.098
emotional and practical compatibility.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.652
Why don't we just date,
see how it goes?

21:07.652 --> 21:10.906
No. I'm not gonna waste time.
We'll see a doctor.

21:16.050 --> 21:18.493
Hey. How's it going?

21:40.645 --> 21:41.863
What the hell is this?

21:41.863 --> 21:43.783
Shut up and sing.

21:43.783 --> 21:45.088
I don't know the words.

21:45.088 --> 21:48.088
“Oy yoi yoi.” Just do it.

22:07.490 --> 22:10.838
I work as an air traffic controller
at O'Hare airport in Chicago, Illinois.

22:10.838 --> 22:12.960
That sounds like a high-stress job.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.962
You have no idea.

22:14.962 --> 22:18.623
Tell me, sir, on the evening
of November 7, 2006,

22:18.623 --> 22:22.857
did you get any calls, uh,
about, say extraterrestrials?

22:22.857 --> 22:23.788
I'm sorry.

22:23.788 --> 22:25.592
Could we be any more leading?

22:25.592 --> 22:28.132
Perhaps you should whip out
one of those leashes you use

22:28.132 --> 22:30.040
in your recreational pursuits?
–What?

22:30.040 --> 22:33.388
Overruled. Sit down, you.

22:35.982 --> 22:39.579
Uh, we were contacted by airline
supervisor and informed that

22:39.579 --> 22:43.969
several of its passengers as well as
a dozen or so of its employees

22:43.969 --> 22:46.049
spotted an elliptical shaped craft

22:46.049 --> 22:48.738
sitting motionless over concourse C
of the United terminal.

22:48.738 --> 22:53.251
In fact, even the United airlines' pilot
claimed to have seen it. Am I right?

22:53.251 --> 22:54.072
You are.

22:54.072 --> 22:57.294
So one wouldn't be considered
out of touch with reality or…

22:57.294 --> 22:59.630
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

22:59.630 --> 23:02.345
Ooh. Sorry, your honor.
Remember, it isn't real.

23:02.345 --> 23:04.261
It's just wood.
Pay no mind.

23:04.261 --> 23:08.734
Wood is flammable.
You will not light it.

23:14.918 --> 23:18.327
Mr Bettman, can you say with all certainty

23:18.327 --> 23:22.819
that there wasn't a UFO
hovering over O'Hare that night?

23:22.819 --> 23:25.315
Well, I suppose
we can't prove a negative.

23:25.315 --> 23:28.848
But our conclusion was that
it was a weather phenomenon.

23:28.848 --> 23:30.843
A loud cloud ceiling.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.240
A lot of lights in the sky.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.253
This was no weather phenomenon.

23:36.253 --> 23:39.821
It hovered, and then it shot through
the clouds and left a hole.

23:39.821 --> 23:41.008
A hole?

23:41.008 --> 23:44.510
Dozens of people gave
the exact same description,

23:44.510 --> 23:47.428
including some mechanics
at the airlines.

23:47.428 --> 23:51.028
There was something unearthly up there.

23:51.028 --> 23:53.221
And the radar showed nothing?

23:53.221 --> 23:57.386
The FAA won't release the radar data
or the voice communications.

23:57.386 --> 23:59.151
What are they hiding?

23:59.151 --> 24:02.285
Well, on the “X-files,”
it was the truth.

24:02.285 --> 24:03.351
Great show, wasn't it?

24:03.351 --> 24:04.686
How many of you watched the “X-files”?

24:04.686 --> 24:07.929
Friday night, lousy time slot.
–Silence.

24:14.496 --> 24:17.745
I must say, Jerry,
you had quite the swagger in there.

24:17.745 --> 24:20.449
Look, Alan, the fact that
others thought they saw it

24:20.449 --> 24:22.123
doesn't really matter.

24:22.123 --> 24:23.124
Of course it matters.

24:23.124 --> 24:25.959
The fact that others saw it
means my client isn't crazy,

24:25.959 --> 24:28.056
which was the very basis
of his discharge.

24:28.056 --> 24:30.675
No. The basis was that he talked
about it with his clients.

24:30.675 --> 24:32.268
No. It was that he thought
he saw an alien…

24:32.268 --> 24:33.683
Look, I'd love to help you here,
I really would,

24:33.683 --> 24:35.589
but my hands are tied.

24:35.589 --> 24:38.074
Your hands aren't tied.
They're in your pockets.

24:38.074 --> 24:39.443
What is this?

24:39.443 --> 24:41.507
New therapy.
Good, isn't it?

24:41.507 --> 24:43.592
Look, here's the deal.

24:43.592 --> 24:44.530
You're gonna get up,

24:44.530 --> 24:48.116
say “others saw it, blah, blah, blah,
therefore not crazy.”

24:48.116 --> 24:49.744
Whatever. You'll be effective.
You always are.

24:49.744 --> 24:51.429
But I'll get up,

24:51.429 --> 24:53.715
make the point that a function of his job.

24:53.715 --> 24:57.558
The function, actually,
is to ground his patients.

24:57.558 --> 24:59.651
A therapist has to come
from a relatable place.

24:59.651 --> 25:02.919
Al, come on. When you sit there
and talk about space aliens,

25:02.919 --> 25:06.092
how effective can you really be
as a cognitive therapist?

25:06.092 --> 25:08.192
Do we sympathize?
Of course we do.

25:08.192 --> 25:11.407
But the man can no longer do his job.

25:15.188 --> 25:18.574
Here's the problem
with your theory, Jerry.

25:18.574 --> 25:20.437
As plausible as it sounds now,

25:20.437 --> 25:23.408
you and I both know when you
actually get up to give your closing,

25:23.408 --> 25:25.705
you're Hands Espenson.

25:25.705 --> 25:28.805
Chewing on a silly wooden cigarette
isn't going to distract you

25:28.805 --> 25:32.333
from the reality that you have
very little trial experience,

25:32.333 --> 25:34.367
that you're scared to death
just to be in the room,

25:34.367 --> 25:37.466
and that as able as you might be
to fool others or even yourself,

25:37.466 --> 25:39.532
I know what you are,

25:39.532 --> 25:43.753
and knowing that I know,
feeling my stare upon you,

25:43.753 --> 25:46.793
that you'll be utterly reduced
to an ineffective, bumbling,

25:46.793 --> 25:48.833
inarticulate man with Asperger's,

25:48.833 --> 25:52.388
because that's what you are, Jerry.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.882
Jerry…

26:01.635 --> 26:03.188
Jerry.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.241
I was just lawyering, Jerry.

26:45.759 --> 26:52.921
One of the games trial attorneys play
is to psych-out opposing counsel.

26:52.921 --> 26:55.894
You can certainly appreciate that.

26:56.765 --> 26:58.403
My intent was to unnerve you,

26:58.403 --> 27:02.473
not because I believe you
to be ineffective or inarticulate

27:02.473 --> 27:04.683
but because I know you to be
just the opposite.

27:04.683 --> 27:06.473
I don't believe you.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.948
I have a proposal.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.625
I'm listening.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.557
My client gets his job back,

27:21.557 --> 27:26.613
he agrees not to discuss
the UFO sighting or his opinions on…

27:26.613 --> 27:30.273
extraterrestrial life.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.188
–No money damages.
–Okay.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.227
Jerry…

27:48.625 --> 27:51.609
you'll recall I once advised you

27:51.609 --> 27:55.127
to flee the practice of law
because it's an ugly occupation,

27:55.127 --> 28:00.588
which calls upon its participants
to do ugly things.

28:01.424 --> 28:07.627
I am very accomplished
in the practice of law, Jerry.

28:11.779 --> 28:14.413
I'll take the offer to my client.

28:22.805 --> 28:28.407
Basically, I don't think that we're
compatible as a couple, as partners.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.924
50-50 partners.

28:30.924 --> 28:32.385
If we were to be together,

28:32.385 --> 28:35.407
he would probably start out
by, by demanding that I quit my job

28:35.407 --> 28:38.122
and stay at home with the baby.

28:38.122 --> 28:40.427
Is that true, Brad?

28:41.328 --> 28:42.262
Yes.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.265
You don't think a woman can have
both a career and a family?

28:45.265 --> 28:47.035
Can she? Of course.

28:47.035 --> 28:48.946
Should she? Absolutely not.

28:48.946 --> 28:51.180
Oh, and, and this is him wooing me.

28:51.180 --> 28:52.574
Denise, you have a baby,
that's it.

28:52.574 --> 28:54.295
Baby comes first, period.

28:54.295 --> 28:56.176
Even if he could get by
with a nanny, you couldn't.

28:56.176 --> 28:57.895
It would kill you.
So who are we kidding here?

28:57.895 --> 28:59.437
You stay home,
you raise the kid,

28:59.437 --> 29:02.571
the kid grows up,
then you can go back to work.

29:03.861 --> 29:06.332
Okay, don't look at me like that.

29:06.332 --> 29:08.639
Mothers want to stay home.

29:08.639 --> 29:11.089
It's only because of societal pressures
they feel they can't be a feminist

29:11.089 --> 29:12.866
and still a stay-at-home mom,
so what do they do?

29:12.866 --> 29:15.065
They drag themselves back to
the office, and like I said,

29:15.065 --> 29:16.866
it kills them,
and it'll kill Denise.

29:16.866 --> 29:19.591
Now I wouldn't ask her to do anything
that she doesn't really want to do.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.109
I know that. She knows that.

29:21.109 --> 29:23.126
And if you're any kind
of a real therapist,

29:23.126 --> 29:25.105
you know that, too.

29:28.988 --> 29:32.091
This idea of a 50-50 partnership…

29:32.091 --> 29:34.451
She picks the wallpaper.
I choose the car.

29:34.451 --> 29:36.491
–Chores? –I mow the lawn.
She makes dinner.

29:36.491 --> 29:40.210
–Sex? –I'm the husband.
She's the wife.

29:46.393 --> 29:50.809
Even if she's right about
what her father would've wanted,

29:50.809 --> 29:56.080
that does not entitle her
to steal the body from a museum.

29:56.445 --> 29:58.868
She can resort to equitable relief,

29:58.868 --> 30:00.877
but not grand larceny.

30:00.877 --> 30:05.591
Beyond that, this is about
her religious beliefs, not her father's.

30:05.591 --> 30:10.848
He didn't believe in God
or heaven or the soul.

30:10.848 --> 30:16.301
This is about the defendant
imposing her religious values

30:16.301 --> 30:18.992
and committing a crime to do so.

30:18.992 --> 30:22.842
We all know how dangerous
that can be.

30:37.728 --> 30:39.375
Alan…

30:39.375 --> 30:41.613
it's your turn.

30:41.613 --> 30:44.167
I know that, Clarence.

30:49.564 --> 30:54.005
Life on earth was not very good
to Maureen Fleming's father.

30:54.005 --> 30:56.909
He was a drunk.
He couldn't hold a job.

30:56.909 --> 30:58.448
He had sordid affairs.

30:58.448 --> 31:01.431
He died in part from
a sexually transmitted disease.

31:01.431 --> 31:04.610
There was no salvation or happy ending

31:04.610 --> 31:07.831
to be found on earth
for Nathan Fleming.

31:07.831 --> 31:11.650
Which could only make Maureen
that much more desperate to think

31:11.650 --> 31:17.557
that there must be another, better world
waiting for her father somewhere.

31:17.557 --> 31:20.467
She carted his body out of that museum

31:20.467 --> 31:24.910
so that her father could finally
leave this world behind.

31:24.910 --> 31:26.983
And hopefully…

31:28.237 --> 31:32.975
find his way to a better one.

31:33.166 --> 31:38.728
Certainly, the 12 of you
can understand that.

31:47.869 --> 31:49.067
You know, I…

31:49.067 --> 31:53.743
I want so badly to believe in God.

31:53.743 --> 31:57.874
Not because of any words in the Bible
or claims made by gospels,

31:57.874 --> 32:02.486
but because, I suppose, with our planet
being polluted into extinction

32:02.486 --> 32:05.421
while country after country
develops nuclear bombs,

32:05.421 --> 32:09.169
coinciding with an unprecedented
escalation in hatred

32:09.169 --> 32:13.416
while an entire continent
is dying from AIDS and starvation

32:13.416 --> 32:15.819
as the rest of the world
pretends not to notice,

32:15.819 --> 32:19.819
it's just not that easy these days
to have faith in man.

32:19.819 --> 32:21.871
But if we don't believe in God,

32:21.871 --> 32:24.091
then our only alternative
is to believe in man.

32:24.091 --> 32:27.072
Well, I'm not sure
if I do believe in God.

32:27.072 --> 32:28.337
And even if I did,

32:28.337 --> 32:31.677
I'm not sure he'd be the same God
that you believe in,

32:31.677 --> 32:33.854
or you believe in.

32:33.854 --> 32:38.943
But in the throws of doubt,
I still do believe in man.

32:38.943 --> 32:42.658
I believe in man's innate
sense of humanity,

32:42.658 --> 32:48.677
his potential for compassion,
reason, righteousness in his heart.

32:48.677 --> 32:53.033
Today, now, I appeal to you
in the hope that you'll understand

32:53.033 --> 32:55.654
that when my client
took her father's body

32:55.654 --> 32:58.057
so that she may bury him

32:58.057 --> 33:00.572
so that he may rest in peace

33:00.572 --> 33:03.764
and perhaps find some salvation,

33:03.764 --> 33:08.711
she did so acting on her humanity, on…

33:08.930 --> 33:12.753
the righteousness in her heart.

34:21.221 --> 34:24.128
What have you got
stuck to your face?

34:27.967 --> 34:31.632
Don't you even think about it.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.400
Denny, don't you dare.

34:43.589 --> 34:45.991
Holy crap.
I shot the rabbi.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.120
How did you get a lawyer so quickly?

34:54.120 --> 34:56.693
This is a difficult time
for all of us, Mr Crane.

34:56.693 --> 34:57.858
I think we can agree,

34:57.858 --> 35:00.407
it would be best
to resolve this privately.

35:00.407 --> 35:03.171
If rabbi Hershman were to report
the assault to the police,

35:03.171 --> 35:06.794
well, given your grumblings that were
heard by others in the synagogue,

35:06.794 --> 35:08.671
you could face prosecution
for a hate crime.

35:08.671 --> 35:11.956
You can't threaten criminal prosecution
to advance a civil claim.

35:11.956 --> 35:13.059
What's wrong with you?

35:13.059 --> 35:15.671
You people have an overreacting
problem. You do know that?

35:15.671 --> 35:17.800
–We “people”?
–Yeah, same thing in Lebanon.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.867
They grab a few soldiers,
you respond with overkill.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.131
That's a problem.

35:21.131 --> 35:24.595
Are you saying that Israel doesn't
have the right to defend itself?

35:24.595 --> 35:25.772
Well, of course they do,

35:25.772 --> 35:28.387
but you don't blow up a whole country
'cause you get mad.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.474
Only the United States
enjoys that privilege.

35:30.474 --> 35:33.252
And we're a superpower.
God is on our side.

35:33.252 --> 35:34.680
Gum?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.268
Good-bye, Denny.

35:37.907 --> 35:39.849
What do you mean?

35:39.849 --> 35:43.575
I never want to see you again.

35:51.013 --> 35:52.766
She'll be back.

35:52.766 --> 35:55.332
Get out of my way.
Handicapped.

35:55.332 --> 35:58.008
Look out. Handicapped.

35:59.902 --> 36:03.083
That was quite an interesting tack 
you took there with the therapist, Brad.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.964
It wasn't a tack.
It was the truth.

36:07.801 --> 36:10.005
So when are you gonna
face the truth, Denise?

36:10.005 --> 36:10.861
Which is?

36:10.861 --> 36:13.367
That you want for your children
the same life that your parents gave you.

36:13.367 --> 36:15.235
Dad works, mom stays at home,

36:15.235 --> 36:18.108
The perfect Norman Rockwell
nuclear family that used to be.

36:18.108 --> 36:21.357
Uh, Brad, we live in very
different times than they did.

36:21.357 --> 36:22.458
Oh, right, modern times.

36:22.458 --> 36:26.015
50% of women are manless
right now. 50%.

36:26.015 --> 36:28.046
Is that progress, feminism or both?

36:28.046 --> 36:31.665
It, it, what, do you intend to
bludgeon me into giving us a chance?

36:31.665 --> 36:34.465
No. I'm asking.

36:34.465 --> 36:39.232
For you, for me, for our child.

36:39.232 --> 36:41.774
Give us a chance.

36:48.234 --> 36:52.226
Madam Foreperson, the jury
has reached a unanimous verdict?

36:52.226 --> 36:54.451
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

36:54.451 --> 36:57.527
“In the matter of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts vs Maureen Fleming”

36:57.527 --> 36:59.644
“on the charge of grand theft larceny,”

36:59.644 --> 37:02.619
“we the jury find the defendant…”

37:03.313 --> 37:05.457
“not guilty.”

37:05.762 --> 37:07.975
The Commonwealth thanks you
for your service.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.635
We are adjourned.

37:12.524 --> 37:14.331
Congratulations, Maureen.

37:14.331 --> 37:15.885
Thank you.

37:20.242 --> 37:23.110
Can I bury my father now?

37:23.660 --> 37:29.655
I'm afraid that's an issue that will
have to be decided at another time.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.748
Jerry.

37:44.387 --> 37:49.895
The settlement terms
are acceptable to my client.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.907
Good.

37:55.448 --> 37:59.414
I should also, I should
thank you for the lesson.

37:59.414 --> 38:04.968
Of course opposing counsel will try to
exploit my Asperger's, and…

38:06.624 --> 38:08.984
I thank you, Alan.

38:08.984 --> 38:11.161
As a result of this, my skin
will only get more calloused.

38:11.161 --> 38:13.668
I'll be more hardened.

38:16.746 --> 38:20.372
I want you to know, I don't take
what you said personally.

38:20.372 --> 38:22.616
I do, Jerry.

38:22.616 --> 38:24.508
And I'm deeply sorry.

38:24.508 --> 38:26.545
Don't be.

38:30.905 --> 38:33.288
Well, until we meet again…

38:51.765 --> 38:52.825
She dumped you?

38:52.825 --> 38:55.462
Because of my views
on the Middle East.

38:56.755 --> 39:02.278
If I had a nickel for every time
a midget broke up with me over politics.

39:03.231 --> 39:06.571
Denny, you think you can understand
what it means to be Jewish?

39:06.571 --> 39:09.444
Oh, please. I don't even understand
what it means to be Lutheran.

39:09.444 --> 39:11.470
Do you believe in God?

39:12.340 --> 39:14.884
Of course I do.
You know I do.

39:14.884 --> 39:16.395
Why?

39:16.395 --> 39:18.679
Why? Why?

39:18.679 --> 39:22.024
Because if you believe in God
and it turns out there's no God,

39:22.024 --> 39:23.556
there's no harm, no foul.

39:23.556 --> 39:27.529
But if you don't believe in God,
and it turns out that there is one,

39:27.529 --> 39:29.694
you're screwed.

39:29.694 --> 39:31.513
What do you think he looks like?

39:31.513 --> 39:33.560
Like me. Perhaps thinner.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.258
You think he looks like you?

39:35.258 --> 39:37.481
God made man in his image.

39:37.481 --> 39:39.974
–And specifically?
–Me.

39:45.668 --> 39:50.160
Why does he allow for
all the suffering that goes on?

39:51.426 --> 39:54.014
Overextended.

39:55.579 --> 39:57.682
What do you believe?

40:00.091 --> 40:02.327
I'm not sure.

40:05.563 --> 40:11.157
I think I believe mostly in friendship.

40:12.390 --> 40:17.728
Yours, Jerry Espenson's.

40:19.764 --> 40:23.391
I wasn't a very good friend to him today.

40:23.391 --> 40:25.580
I hate that you're seeing him again.

40:25.580 --> 40:28.175
He was opposing counsel.

40:33.133 --> 40:35.975
Oh, I hurt him today.

40:36.981 --> 40:39.025
