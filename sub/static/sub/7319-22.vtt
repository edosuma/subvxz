WEBVTT

00:13.233 --> 00:15.033
(Meredith) THE DREAM IS THIS--

00:15.067 --> 00:18.300
THAT WE'LL FINALLY BE HAPPY
WHEN WE REACH OUR GOALS.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.367
FIND THE GUY,
FINISH OUR INTERNSHIP--

00:20.400 --> 00:22.167
THAT'S THE DREAM.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.533
THEN WE GET THERE.

00:23.567 --> 00:25.467
AND IF WE'RE HUMAN,

00:25.500 --> 00:28.600
WE IMMEDIATELY START DREAMING
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

00:28.633 --> 00:30.733
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

00:30.767 --> 00:32.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

00:32.300 --> 00:33.600
(sighs) I CAN'T SLEEP.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.367
WHAT ARE WE WATCHING?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.300
WHY CAN'T YOU SLEEP?

00:37.333 --> 00:38.633
NO REASON.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.700
THEN WE'D LIKE TO WAKE UP...

00:43.733 --> 00:45.500
(laughter)

00:45.533 --> 00:47.733
NOW, PLEASE.

00:47.767 --> 00:49.133

00:49.167 --> 00:50.667
(Preston laughs)

00:50.700 --> 00:52.367
OKAY.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.067
CRISTINA, STOP LURKING.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.067
COME AND SAY GOOD MORNING
TO YOUR GUESTS.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.767
GOOD MORNING, MOTHER.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.833
UH, GOOD MORNING, MISSUS...
MAMA.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.800
DOING HERE SO EARLY?

01:08.833 --> 01:09.633
EARLY?

01:09.667 --> 01:11.533
DARLING, BY THE LOOK
OF THE CALENDAR,

01:11.567 --> 01:13.433
WE SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE
SIX MONTHS AGO.

01:13.467 --> 01:16.633
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
GOES INTO PLANNING A WEDDING.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.267
***

01:18.300 --> 01:19.667
BREATHE.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.333
SIP... AND BREATHE.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.667
THE POLICE HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING ON OUR JANE DOE.

01:25.700 --> 01:27.600
WELL, I BELIEVE SHE
CALLS HERSELF AVA NOW.

01:27.633 --> 01:30.300
YES, WELL, SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE GETTING HER MEMORY BACK.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.800
WELL, NOW THAT THE REST
OF HER MEDICAL PROBLEMS

01:32.833 --> 01:34.733
ARE TAKEN CARE OF,
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

01:34.767 --> 01:37.067
THAT'D BE GREAT. THANKS.
HAS ANYBODY SEEN ADDISON?

01:37.100 --> 01:39.067
UH, SHE'S GONE.
GONE?

01:39.067 --> 01:41.067
SHE TOOK A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.
WHY?

01:41.100 --> 01:43.567
I MEAN, DID SHE--
DID SHE TELL YOU WHY?
WHAT'D YOU DO TO HER, MARK?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.567
SHE DIDN'T GIVE A REASON.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.700
DID SHE TELL YOU
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

01:47.733 --> 01:50.133
(sighs) ALL SHE SAID WAS
SHE NEEDED SOME TIME,

01:50.167 --> 01:52.333
"TO BE HAPPY AND FREE,"
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.100
EXCUSE ME.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.433

IT'S JUST... UM...

03:05.267 --> 03:07.667
WHERE I COME FROM...

03:07.700 --> 03:11.567
ELEVATORS TEND TO BE THIS
KIND OF APHRODISIAC.
(ding)

03:11.600 --> 03:15.367
YOU KNOW? PEOPLE GET ON 'EM,
AND THEY JUST GET ALL HORNY.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.633
OH, NO!

I'M--I'M JUST SAYING,
IT--IT'S A RELIEF.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.333
YOU KNOW, TO BE ON
A NOT HORNY ELEVATOR.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.067
YOU KNOW?

03:27.067 --> 03:29.433
JUST GET ON...
AND RIDE...

03:29.467 --> 03:31.767

03:40.500 --> 03:41.833
OH, MY GOD.

03:41.867 --> 03:44.300
I'M BECOMING A CRAZY FREAK...

03:44.333 --> 03:48.300
A CRAZY, INAPPROPRIATELY
CHATTING FREAK.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.767
(woman) BECOMING?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.133
(elevator bell dings)

03:51.167 --> 03:53.367
SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE ALREADY THERE.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.467
(Callie) HEY.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.533
OH, HI.

OH.

04:30.233 --> 04:33.167
CRISTINA LED US TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE FRIENDS.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.300

04:36.133 --> 04:38.400
OKAY. I GUESS.

YOU ACTUALLY ASKING ME TO BE--

04:48.733 --> 04:51.500
TO BE ONE OF
MY BRIDESMAIDS? YEAH.

(mouths words)

04:53.333 --> 04:55.167
(mouths words)

04:57.833 --> 05:00.167
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.067
I DID, ACTUALLY,
AFTER I EVICTED A RACCOON

05:02.100 --> 05:04.600
WHO CHEWED HIS WAY
INTO THE LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.533
MM. THE TRAILER.

05:06.567 --> 05:07.733
YES.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.733
SO WHILE YOU
WERE SLEEPING...

05:11.700 --> 05:13.800
(sighs) WHEN I DROWNED,

05:13.833 --> 05:16.700
IT WAS DIFFERENT FOR YOU
THAN IT WAS FOR ME.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.467
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.133
AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT

05:22.167 --> 05:25.767
WITHOUT SOUNDING LIKE...
(sighs)

05:25.800 --> 05:28.200
I JUST--
I FEEL DIFFERENT.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.133
I WANNA BE BETTER
AT EVERYTHING,

05:30.167 --> 05:33.067
AND I WANNA LET YOU IN.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.500
I SWEAR.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.567
DID YOU PRACTICE THAT?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.267
(laughs)

05:39.300 --> 05:42.167
WITH HAND GESTURES,
BUT I DROPPED THOSE.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.067
UH-HUH.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.800
JUST, NOW IS NOT THE TIME
TO GIVE UP ON ME, OKAY?

05:46.833 --> 05:48.300
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.267
OKAY.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.233

SURPRISE!

06:52.467 --> 06:54.367
OH, I GOT LOST
LIKE EIGHT TIMES,

06:54.400 --> 06:58.133
I SMELL LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
DRIVING IN CAR A FOR TWO DAYS,

06:58.167 --> 07:01.067
AND I THINK I JUST HAD
SOME KIND OF PSYCHOTIC BREAK

07:01.067 --> 07:03.500
IN YOUR ELEVATOR, BUT, UM...

07:03.533 --> 07:05.733
SURPRISE! (laughs)

07:05.767 --> 07:07.333
MAYA, GO GET YOUR BACKPACK.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.167
SO...

07:11.200 --> 07:12.533
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ADDISON?

07:12.567 --> 07:14.467
I MISS YOU.
REALLY?

07:14.500 --> 07:17.200
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
IN OVER A YEAR.

07:17.233 --> 07:19.133
UNLESS YOU COUNT
THE CHRISTMAS CARD,

07:19.167 --> 07:21.733
WHICH WAS NICE.
I KNOW, I KNOW. I'M SORRY
ABOUT--I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.633
I LEFT YOU MESSAGES
ON YOUR PAGER. I E-MAILED YOU.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.567
I HAD SOME
REALLY SPECIAL CONVERSATIONS

07:25.600 --> 07:27.500
WITH YOUR VOICE MAIL.
CAN WE JUST LET THIS GO?

07:27.533 --> 07:30.233
I'VE BEEN HAVING SOME ROUGH
TIMES LATELY, OKAY?

07:30.267 --> 07:32.167

GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUT...

07:44.400 --> 07:46.067
"BODY LANGUAGE"?
(clears throat)

07:46.100 --> 07:47.800
UH, YEAH, I JUST--
I HAD A FEW THOUGHTS,

07:47.833 --> 07:49.733
I WROTE 'EM DOWN,
AND THAT'S...

07:49.767 --> 07:52.533
AND NOW YOU'RE
THE COMMON MAN'S MEDICAL GURU.

07:52.567 --> 07:54.500
HEY, DELL, CAN YOU PUSH
MY APPOINTMENTS BACK AN HOUR?

07:54.533 --> 07:56.400
OH.
I HAVE TO RESCUE COOPER.

07:56.433 --> 07:59.167

ADDISON, THIS IS OUR SHRINK.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.800
VIOLET. HI. BYE.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.733
WHAT DID COOPER DO
THIS TIME?
WHAT DOES COOPER ALWAYS DO?

08:02.767 --> 08:04.133
(Sam and Naomi) A WOMAN.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.567
I'M HIS COLLEAGUE,
NOT HIS CHAUFFEUR.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.067
SO THIS IS, UH...
CO-OP MEDICINE, HUH?

08:09.100 --> 08:11.733
YEAH,
DOCTORS WORKING TOGETHER.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.367
IT'S ME, NAOMI, WE HAVE
A PEDIATRICIAN, A SHRINK,

08:14.400 --> 08:15.633
AN ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
PRACTITIONER--

08:15.667 --> 08:19.133
COULD--COULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR JUST A MINUTE?
SURE, I CAN.

08:19.167 --> 08:21.167
GOOD MORNING, NAOMI.
OH, SHUT UP.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.100
SO YOU TWO
STILL WORK TOGETHER?

08:23.133 --> 08:24.467
(Naomi) HEY, PETE.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.733
WHO IS THAT REDHEAD
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE?

08:26.767 --> 08:28.267
SHE'S HOT.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.567
POSSIBLY INSANE, BUT HOT.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.533
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.667
YOU WORK WITH
YOUR EX-HUSBAND

08:34.700 --> 08:37.067
IN A SHRINE
FOR YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

08:37.067 --> 08:39.533
IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD BOOK.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.433
AND WE'RE FRIENDS.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.467
WE STAYED FRIENDS
EVEN AFTER WE GOT DIVORCED.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.833
IT'S VERY HEALTHY.
WE'RE HEALTHY.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.467
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND SAM?

08:48.500 --> 08:51.133
ADDISON, YOU AND I WERE CLOSE
IN MED SCHOOL.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.067
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.200
OH, NAOMI, COME ON.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.133
YOU CAN'T
STAY MAD AT ME FOREVER.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.067
I KNOW YOU.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.400
YOU GOT FAT.

09:00.433 --> 09:01.767
I DID NOT.
YOUR HAIR LOOKS HIDEOUS.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.533
IT DOES NOT.
AND YOU'RE GETTING
REALLY, REALLY UGLY.

09:04.567 --> 09:08.067
AWW. I'VE MISSED YOU, TOO.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.267
(sighs)

09:09.300 --> 09:12.300
SO...
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE?

09:12.333 --> 09:16.833
YOU'RE A FERTILITY SPECIALIST,
ONE OF THE BEST.

09:16.867 --> 09:19.467
YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.667
I WANT TO HAVE A BABY.

09:31.733 --> 09:32.700
(hiccup)

09:32.733 --> 09:33.833
SUSAN GREY.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.767
YOU SURE YOU'RE IN
THE RIGHT PLACE?

09:35.800 --> 09:38.067
I HAVE REFLUX...
(hiccups)

09:38.100 --> 09:39.600
ACID REFLUX.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.533
AND THE, UH, HICCUPS
COME AND GO... (hiccups)

09:41.567 --> 09:43.500
WHEN IT GETS REALLY BAD.
(hiccups)

09:43.533 --> 09:46.333
THEY'VE STOPPED A FEW TIMES,
BUT LATELY IT'S BEEN GETTING...

09:46.367 --> 09:48.267
(hiccups) WORSE.
(hiccups)

09:48.300 --> 09:50.267
HAVE YOU HAD CHLORPROMAZINE?
THANK YOU.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.067
UM, ISN'T THAT
THE CRAZY PERSON'S DRUG?

09:53.100 --> 09:54.833
(laughs) IT'S USED
AS AN ANTI-PSYCHOTIC,

09:54.867 --> 09:56.733
BUT IT'S HELPFUL
WITH HICCUPS.
(hiccups)

09:56.767 --> 09:58.667
AND IF WE DON'T
STOP THESE SOON,

09:58.700 --> 10:00.700
YOU WILL BE A CRAZY PERSON.
(laughs)

10:00.733 --> 10:02.667
AH.
(Miranda) OKAY.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.667
HEY, HOW IS MEREDITH DOING?

10:04.700 --> 10:07.567
I KNOW THEY HAVE THAT BIG
INTERN EXAM COMING UP,

10:07.600 --> 10:09.167
AND SHE'S BEEN REALLY BUSY.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.367
I TRIED TO CALL, BUT...

10:10.400 --> 10:12.833
UH...

10:12.867 --> 10:14.767
HEY, NO HICCUPS.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.567
(chuckles)
CHLORPROMAZINE.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.167
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER, YOU KNOW?

10:21.200 --> 10:23.100
AND I ALWAYS PLANNED
TO HAVE ONE,

10:23.133 --> 10:24.500
IT'S JUST--WELL, NOW CLEARLY,

10:24.533 --> 10:26.433
A MAN IS NOT
IN THE CARDS FOR ME.

10:26.467 --> 10:28.700
I MEAN, THIS IS ADDISON
POST McDREAMY, POST McSTEAMY.

10:28.733 --> 10:31.067
YOU KNOW, I JUST HAVE TO...
(makes whooshing sound)

10:31.100 --> 10:32.133
McWHAT?

10:32.167 --> 10:34.767
FORGET IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S NEVER "Mc" ANYTHING.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.100
A BABY, THAT IS...
MY ANSWER.

10:38.133 --> 10:40.567
FIND A SPERM DONOR,
HAVE A BABY.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.767
MY NEW DREAM--A BABY.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.433
A BABY'S NOT REALLY
AN ANSWER.

10:44.467 --> 10:47.333
IT'S MORE OF A CRYING,
PUKING, NON-ANSWER.
YEAH, BUT YOU DID IT.

10:47.367 --> 10:49.333
YEAH, WITH A HUSBAND.
YEAH, BUT YOU DID IT.

10:49.367 --> 10:51.267
YOU GOT MARRIED,
YOU HAD A BABY.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.333
YOU'RE MY EXAMPLE.

10:53.367 --> 10:55.233
OKAY, WE SHOULD CHECK
YOUR F.S.H.

10:55.267 --> 10:57.033
AND YOUR ESTRADIOL LEVELS,

10:57.067 --> 10:58.800
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO
AND ANTRAL FOLLICLE COUNT.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.700
HOLY CRAP. (sighs)

11:00.733 --> 11:03.100
I'M GONNA HAVE A BABY.

11:03.133 --> 11:05.600
(laughs)

11:05.633 --> 11:07.533
OOH. THE TREADMILL, HUH?

11:07.567 --> 11:10.067
MM.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.400
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:11.433 --> 11:14.267
I TRIED TO TAKE IT UP TO TEN
AND DO THE HILLY TERRAIN MODE,

11:14.300 --> 11:17.067
WHICH YOU CAN DO,
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE AN OLYMPIAN,

11:17.100 --> 11:18.833
SO I PAUSED
AND I WENT FLYING OFF.

11:18.867 --> 11:21.733
NO. I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
YOU PUSHING YOURSELF THIS HARD?

11:21.767 --> 11:24.400
THIS IS YOUR FOURTH
SPORTS INJURY IN THREE MONTHS.

11:26.367 --> 11:29.067
I AM A SEXUAL PERSON.

11:29.067 --> 11:31.667
I'M A NORMAL SEXUAL PERSON.
I LIKE SEX.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.600
I NEED SEX.
AND HE WON'T DO IT.

11:33.633 --> 11:36.600
HE WON'T HAVE SEX WITH ME.
HE JUST... WON'T.

11:36.633 --> 11:38.533
I'M HOPING YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.833
WELL, I'M NOT HOPING
BECAUSE OF THE NO SEX PART--
IT'S BEEN 18 MONTHS.

11:40.867 --> 11:41.867
WOW.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.700
18 MONTHS! DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT THAT IS LIKE?

11:44.733 --> 11:47.067
MY HUSBAND WON'T DO IT.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.567
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO?
UH, YOU RUN.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.067
I RUN. I RUN SO I WON'T
SLEEP WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.833
I RUN SO I HAVE SOMEPLACE
TO CHANNEL MY ENERGIES.

11:53.867 --> 11:56.733
I RUN SO I WON'T PICK UP
A TIRE IRON

11:56.767 --> 12:00.267
AND BEAT MY HUSBAND TO DEATH.
I NEED SEX!

12:01.633 --> 12:04.067
YOU'D DO IT WITH ME, RIGHT?

12:04.100 --> 12:06.067
HMM?

12:06.067 --> 12:08.800
I THINK YOU NEED TO SPEND
SOME TIME WITH OUR THERAPIST.

12:08.833 --> 12:11.567
(sighs)

12:11.600 --> 12:12.800
(honks horn)

12:12.833 --> 12:14.567
(man) HEY!

12:16.667 --> 12:18.833
(grunts) HEY.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.300
(clears throat)

12:20.333 --> 12:22.233
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

12:22.267 --> 12:25.167
(sniffles)

12:25.200 --> 12:28.233
HEY, HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?
WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

12:28.267 --> 12:30.100
WERE YOU CRYING?
WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

12:30.133 --> 12:32.167
WERE YOU CRYING?
YOU WANNA WALK?

12:32.200 --> 12:34.100
I MET A GIRL AT A BAR...

12:34.133 --> 12:35.267
(chuckles)

12:35.300 --> 12:37.167
ON THE INTERNET...

12:37.200 --> 12:40.067
AND SHE BORROWED MY CAR.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.300
(snickers) DID YOU FILE
A POLICE REPORT?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.233
SHE MIGHT BRING THE CAR BACK.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.267
SHE WAS GORGEOUS AND HOT
AND S--
OKAY, COOPER, COOPER, COOPER.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.200
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU MEET
A STRANGE WOMAN

12:48.233 --> 12:49.567
ON THE INTERNET AGAIN.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.800
YOU BRING HER BACK
TO YOUR APARTMENT

12:50.833 --> 12:53.433
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU AGAIN,
AND SHE STEALS FROM YOU AGAIN.

12:53.467 --> 12:56.300
WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST
TO YOU ABOUT YOU?

12:56.333 --> 12:58.733
THAT I'M AN OPTIMIST.

12:58.767 --> 12:59.800
THAT I BELIEVE IN MAGIC.

12:59.833 --> 13:05.633
THAT THERE IS A SOUL MATE
OUT THERE WAITING FOR ME.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.133
(whimpers)

13:08.167 --> 13:10.200
OH, VIOLET...

13:12.533 --> 13:14.433
ALLAN'S NOT WORTH IT.
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.367
I KNOW THAT. I DO.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.300
I'M NOT... (clears throat)

13:18.333 --> 13:21.233
I'M NOT CRYING ABOUT HIM.
I'M NOT. (sniffles)

13:21.267 --> 13:24.133
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
LOOK OVER THERE.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.433
(ferry horn blows)

13:31.467 --> 13:33.367
I SWITCHED MY HOURS
AT THE CLINIC

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
SO I CAN GO
TO THE BRIDAL SHOP. YAY!

13:35.433 --> 13:36.767
DID SHE CHEER?
SHE JUST CHEERED.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.233
SOMEONE'S NOT BEING
VERY BRIDE-Y

13:38.267 --> 13:40.067
I AM NOT A BRIDE.
I AM A SURGEON.

13:40.067 --> 13:41.600
DON'T TEASE
THE CAGED ANIMAL.

13:41.633 --> 13:43.133
YOU'RE NOT EXCITED?

13:43.167 --> 13:45.433
I'M EXCITED.
I LOVE WEDDINGS.

13:45.467 --> 13:48.600
WEDDINGS ARE ALL ABOUT HOPE
AND THE FUTURE.

13:48.633 --> 13:49.733
OKAY.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.233
I RESCHEDULED AN A.C.L. REPAIR,
BUT I WANNA BE CLEAR.

13:52.267 --> 13:54.267
I WILL NOT BE WEARING PINK
OR BABY BLUE.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.200
I DO NOT DO FLOWERS IN MY HAIR.

13:56.233 --> 13:58.467
AND I WILL NEVER BE SEEN
WITH A BOW ON MY ASS, OKAY?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.133
SEE? SHE'S GOT
THE RIGHT ATTITUDE.
(laughs)

14:00.167 --> 14:01.733
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.600
HEY.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.067
(Thatcher) HEY.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.600
HI. I--I'M HERE WITH SUSAN.
SHE'S DOWN IN THE CLINIC.

14:07.633 --> 14:09.133
THE CLINIC?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

14:09.167 --> 14:12.067
(Thatcher) YEAH.
CALLIE'S A BRIDESMAID?

14:12.067 --> 14:14.067
YEAH.

14:14.067 --> 14:17.200
YEAH, CA--YES, OF COURSE.
CALLIE'S A BRIDESMAID.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.433
(laughs) FUN.
(Callie laughs) YEAH.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.467
YEAH.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.167
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.067
THAT KID OF YOURS IS GONNA
NEED YOU ON YOUR FEET.

14:26.100 --> 14:26.933
SHE'S CUTE, HUH?
SHE'S A CUTE SHRIVELED KID.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.100
SHE'S CUTE. COME ON.
LET'S KEEP WALKING.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.467
(groans)

14:30.500 --> 14:32.400
SO... WHERE IS SHE?

14:32.433 --> 14:34.333
RED--I THOUGHT THAT WAS ON.

14:34.367 --> 14:35.400
(chuckles) WALK.

14:35.433 --> 14:37.067
GOSSIP.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.500
OH, YOU CALLED IT.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.600
SHE WAS TOO SERIOUS
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

14:40.633 --> 14:42.533
AND ALEX
IS A ROLLING STONE.

14:42.567 --> 14:43.733
I WAS BEING THOUGHTFUL.

14:43.767 --> 14:47.700
YEAH, RIGHT. AND DUMPING RED
AFTER ONE NIGHT IS SENSITIVE?

14:47.733 --> 14:50.133
COME ON.
YOU NEED TO BUFF UP.

14:50.167 --> 14:52.633
SO DID SHE JUST TAKE OFF?
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HER?

14:52.667 --> 14:54.167
DID SHE CRY?

14:54.200 --> 14:55.133
(elevator bell dings)

14:55.167 --> 14:56.800
OW.
IDIOT.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.333
YOU DIVORCED NAOMI?

14:58.367 --> 15:00.667
LOOK, JUST MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS, OK--OUCH.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.667
MORON.
SHE IS MY BEST FRIEND.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.400
STOP HITTING ME
ON TOP OF MY HEAD.

15:05.433 --> 15:07.200
DID YOU CHEAT?

15:07.233 --> 15:08.733
DI--OKAY. (clears throat)

15:08.767 --> 15:10.667
TWO THINGS I LEARNED
WAY BACK IN KINDERGARTEN--

15:10.700 --> 15:12.600
ONE, KEEP YOUR HANDS
TO YOURSELF,

15:12.633 --> 15:14.667
TWO, HE WHO SMELT IT
DEALT IT.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.200
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

15:16.233 --> 15:17.700
YEAH. WELL...

15:17.733 --> 15:19.367
YOU CHEATED.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.800
YOU CHEATED ON YOUR HUSBAND
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.167
THERE. SMELT IT, DEALT IT--
IT WORKS.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.367
YOU'RE USING FART LOGIC.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.300
HEY, IF YOU WANT DETAILS,
GO SEE NAOMI.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.533
SHE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
WELL, THEN YOU GET NO DETAILS.

15:29.567 --> 15:32.167
I'M ON HER SIDE.
YOU KNOW THAT.
THAT'S WHY YOU GET NO DETAILS.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.100
OH, DETAILS!

15:34.133 --> 15:36.600
WOMAN, BE QUIET.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.667
I'VE MISSED YOU.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.200
YEAH.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.433
WELL, YOU KNOW, NAOMI'S
KNOWN YOU LONGER,

15:44.467 --> 15:48.500
SO SHE GETS CUSTODY OF YOU
IN THE DIVORCE.

15:48.533 --> 15:52.200
(sighs) YEAH.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.433
(Addison) SO, UH,
OTHER THAN PROJECT BABY,

15:54.467 --> 15:56.133
THIS IS STRICTLY A VACATION.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.333
I AM HERE
TO READ TRASHY NOVELS

15:58.367 --> 15:59.800
AND GO TO THE BEACH.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.433
OKAY, NOBODY OVER 30
GOES TO THE BEACH.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.600
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE
AT THE PRACTICE, HANG OUT,

16:04.633 --> 16:06.133
SEE HOW WE WORK.
(chuckles)

16:06.167 --> 16:08.267
IT'S MORE FUN
THAN A STUFFY HOSPITAL.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.600
(singsongy voice)
AND WE HAVE AN EMPTY OFFICE.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.500
NAI,
ARE YOU TRYING TO LURE ME?

16:12.533 --> 16:13.600
(normal voice)
LOOK, MAYBE.

16:13.633 --> 16:15.533
WE DO HAVE SUNSHINE
AND CUTE BOYS.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.200
YEAH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
CUTE BOY BEHIND THE DESK

16:18.233 --> 16:20.133
IS TRACKING YOU
WITH HIS EYES.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.667
NO, HE'S NOT.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.067
OH, CUTE BOY WANTS NAOMI.
(chuckles)

16:24.067 --> 16:26.233
OKAY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SHUT UP...
(growls)

16:26.267 --> 16:28.133
AND GO GET SOME COFFEE
OR SOMETHING...
(imitates claws clicking)

16:28.167 --> 16:29.367
PLEASE.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.800
***

16:31.833 --> 16:34.700
YOU HAVE TO STOP THAT.
STOP WHAT?

16:34.733 --> 16:37.333
YOU CANNOT
WATCH ME LIKE THAT.

16:37.367 --> 16:40.133
IT'S... NOT SOMETHING YOU
CAN DO. I WON'T ALLOW IT.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.333
YOU CAN'T MAKE RULES
ABOUT MY EYES.
(man) THAT'S ENOUGH!

16:42.367 --> 16:44.067
(woman) NO!
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

16:44.067 --> 16:46.333
(woman) ALL OF YOU,
JUST STOP IT!

16:46.367 --> 16:48.100
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

16:48.133 --> 16:49.533
WHAT WAS THAT?

16:49.567 --> 16:52.300
DID I JUST HEAR--
(glass shatters)

16:52.333 --> 16:54.233
(woman screams)
I'M THE FATHER OF THAT CHILD!

16:54.267 --> 16:56.300
NO, I'M THE FATHER!
IF IT'S ANYBODY'S BABY,
IT'S MINE!

16:56.333 --> 16:59.067
STOP IT!
(Cooper) CALM DOWN, EVERYBODY!
JUST--HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

16:59.067 --> 17:00.500
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! A LITTLE
HELP HERE. A LITTLE HELP.

17:00.533 --> 17:02.733
(woman) DR. FREEDMAN!
(Naomi) OH, MY GOD, COOPER!

17:02.767 --> 17:05.067
(Violet) COOPER!
OH, GOD!

17:05.100 --> 17:07.167
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
REALLY GREAT.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.300
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.600
(hiccups)

17:13.633 --> 17:15.700
YOU COULD'VE CALLED.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.633
OH, IT'S SUCH A SILLY PROBLEM.
HICCUPS?

17:17.667 --> 17:20.233
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER YOU.
(hiccups)

17:20.267 --> 17:22.600
WELL, IT'S NOT SILLY
IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP.

17:22.633 --> 17:25.433
CHLORPROMAZINE IS GOOD, BUT IT
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK LONG-TERM.
(Susan hiccups)

17:25.467 --> 17:28.767
WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD RESULT
WITH ENDOSCOPIC GASTROPLICATION.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.333
WE PUT A TUBE
DOWN YOUR THROAT

17:31.367 --> 17:33.300
AND SEW TOGETHER
THE BOTTOM OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS

17:33.333 --> 17:35.533
TO PROTECT IT FROM
THE ACID IN YOUR STOMACH.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.700
IT WOULD BE
AN OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE.
I'M SOLD.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.667
READY WHEN YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SURE THAT
THAT'S NOT--

17:39.700 --> 17:41.333
JUST THINK OF IT LIKE

17:41.367 --> 17:44.167
BREATHING INTO A VERY EXPENSIVE
BROWN PAPER BAG.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.600
(hiccups)

17:45.633 --> 17:48.267
OKAY, LET ME SEE IF I CAN
EXPLAIN THIS TO EVERYONE.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.733
SO CAROL WAS MARRIED TO RICK.

17:50.767 --> 17:53.367
CAROL IS NOW MARRIED TO DOUG.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.267
KEITH IS LISA'S HUSBAND.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.133
UH, I'M RICK'S HUSBAND.
LIFE PARTNER.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.833
YOU'RE JUST MAD
I LEFT YOU FOR A MAN.
I'M LISA'S HUSBAND.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.300
AND LISA IS THE--
SURROGATE CARRYING MY CHILD.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.367
OUR CHILD.
(Rick) YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER!

18:05.400 --> 18:07.233
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT, RICK!
I AM SO SICK OF YOU!

18:07.267 --> 18:09.333
HEY, HEY!
O-OKAY, OKAY.

18:09.367 --> 18:13.233
LET'S ALL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT
WE ARE IN A PLACE OF HEALING.

18:13.267 --> 18:14.733
UH, LISA...

18:14.767 --> 18:18.267
H-HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

18:18.300 --> 18:20.167
(crying)

18:20.200 --> 18:22.467
GUILTY.
GUILTY IS HOW SHE IS FEELING.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.100
(Lisa whimpers)
WH-WHY IS THAT, LISA?

18:25.133 --> 18:27.433
BECAUSE THE SAME WEEK THAT
I BROUGHT HER HERE

18:27.467 --> 18:28.800
TO BE INSEMINATED,

18:28.833 --> 18:30.733
SHE HAD SEX WITH HIM...

18:30.767 --> 18:33.300
AND HIM... AND HIM.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.100
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THE FATHER IS.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.800
(Carol) YEAH, SHE, UM,
REALLY GETS AROUND.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.533
OKAY, HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?

18:43.567 --> 18:45.733
HOW DO YOU PICK A SUPER FREAK
FOR A SURROGATE?

18:45.767 --> 18:47.300
I-I SCREENED HER.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.367
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
TO INDICATE SHE WAS--
(Cooper) SEX CRAZED?
INSATIABLE?

18:50.400 --> 18:51.800
COOPER-LIKE?
OOH. OKAY.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.100
THE POINT IS, EVERYBODY'S
FLIPPING OUT OVER NOTHING.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.067
MEDICALLY, IT HAS TO BE
RICK'S BABY.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.433
WE IMPLANTED LISA
WITH A FERTILIZED EMBRYO

18:58.467 --> 18:59.667
FROM CAROL'S EGG
AND RICK'S SPERM.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.733
THEN RICK IMPLANTED SOME MORE
OF HIS OWN FOR GOOD MEASURE.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.533
(Naomi) BEFORE HE DECIDED
HE WAS GAY.
I'VE TREATED DOUG.

19:05.567 --> 19:08.433
I HAVE HIM ON VALERIAN ROOT
FOR ANXIETY AND STRESS.

19:08.467 --> 19:10.367
AND I KNEW
HE WAS FOOLING AROUND,

19:10.400 --> 19:11.700
BUT WITH HIS
NEW WIFE'S SURROGATE?

19:11.733 --> 19:15.333
CAN I JUST, UH... I THINK
THE MORE PRESSING ISSUE,

19:15.367 --> 19:18.233
UH, HERE, IS THAT, UH,
LISA'S HAD NO PRENATAL CARE.

19:18.267 --> 19:20.300
SHE TOOK OFF
RIGHT AFTER HER, UH--

19:20.333 --> 19:22.433
(Cooper) SEX-A-THON?

19:22.467 --> 19:24.800
HI. WE HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY MET.
COOPER. PEDIATRICS.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.567
HI. UH, YEAH,
SHE... LEFT TOWN,

19:27.600 --> 19:30.833
AND, UH, SHE AND THE BABY
NEED A COMPLETE WORKUP.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.767
UM, WHO'S YOUR USUAL G.Y.N.?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.533
UH, SHE LEFT THE PRACTICE
RATHER SUDDENLY.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.200
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

19:39.233 --> 19:41.167
WELL, LOOK, I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO EXAMINE HER.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.067
TRASHY NOVELS CAN WAIT.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.733
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF...

19:44.767 --> 19:47.400
PLYING YOUR TRADE
IN SUNNIER CLIMES, ADDISON?

19:47.433 --> 19:48.767
"SUNNIER CLIMES"?

19:48.800 --> 19:51.167
NOW WE SEE WHY HE HAS TO TYPE
TO PICK UP WOMEN.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.333
HEY!

19:52.367 --> 19:55.767
BESIDES, WE HAVE A VERY STRICT
NO CONSORTING RULE HERE NOW.

19:57.367 --> 20:00.200
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.833
(hiccups)
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL MEREDITH

20:04.867 --> 20:06.800
HER STEPMOM HICCUPPED
THROUGH THE WHOLE THING.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.200
SHE SHOULD BE HERE FOR THIS.

20:08.233 --> 20:11.233
SUSAN ASKED HER
TO BE WITH HER FATHER.

20:11.267 --> 20:14.833
SHE SAID HE'S HAVING
A LOT OF ANXIETY.

20:14.867 --> 20:18.633
AND... MEREDITH IS SUPPOSED
TO HELP WITH THAT?

20:18.667 --> 20:20.267
(Susan hiccups)

20:20.300 --> 20:23.300
YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.233
(sighs) WHAT I...

20:25.267 --> 20:26.233
(chuckles)

20:26.267 --> 20:30.467
WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS
MOLLY LIVING IN A NEW CITY

20:30.500 --> 20:32.400
ALONE WITH A BABY
MOST OF THE DAY.

20:32.433 --> 20:33.767
THAT'S HARD.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.267
AND LEXIE, WHO'S...
ABOUT TO START HER RESIDENCY.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.633
SHE'S A REALLY GOOD STUDENT,
BUT IT'S GRUELING.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.100
I KNOW.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.400
YOU KNOW.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.767
RIGHT.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.233
AND...
I WORRY ABOUT YOU, TOO.

20:46.267 --> 20:48.167
HOW YOU'RE GETTING ON,
YOUR MOM--

20:48.200 --> 20:50.600
NONE OF THAT WAS... SIMPLE.

20:53.167 --> 20:56.033
SUSAN'S REALLY ON YOU
TO TALK TO ME, HUH?

20:56.067 --> 20:56.867
(chuckles)

20:56.900 --> 20:59.200
(laughs) I GOT TO ADMIT,
I'M ENVIOUS...

20:59.233 --> 21:02.400
THAT SHE'S
GETTING TO KNOW YOU,

21:02.433 --> 21:04.700
AND I'M NOT YET.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.700
I THINK SHE MAY BE FAKING
THESE HICCUPS.

21:08.733 --> 21:12.167
TO GET... US
IN THE SAME PLACE?

21:12.200 --> 21:13.133
(laughs)

21:13.167 --> 21:14.600
(laughs)

21:14.633 --> 21:18.200
(man) I GUESS
I'M JUST NOT VERY SEXUAL.

21:18.233 --> 21:21.300
HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR. HE'S NOT
IN LOVE WITH ME ANYMORE.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.233
THAT'S NOT TRUE, HONEY.
I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

21:24.267 --> 21:26.833
I-I WANT TO DO IT.

21:26.867 --> 21:29.567
I JUST WANT
TO WANT TO DO IT.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.433
OKAY, PAUL, I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU SOME HOMEWORK

21:32.467 --> 21:33.667
FOR NEXT SESSION.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.100
HOMEWORK?
HAVE SEX WITH YOUR WIFE.

21:36.133 --> 21:37.233
YAY!

21:37.267 --> 21:39.400
WELL, BUT--
NO MATTER WHAT.

21:39.433 --> 21:41.333
WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
OR NOT, HAVE SEX.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.600
DO IT IN THE BED,
DO IT ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

21:43.633 --> 21:44.767
DO YOU HAVE A POOL?
YES.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.700
OKAY, DO IT IN THE POOL.
DO IT IN THE POOL.

21:46.733 --> 21:48.633
HAVE SEX. NO PRESSURE,
NO JUDGMENT, NO EXPECTATIONS.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.333
HAVE SEX.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.067
JUST... DO IT.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.833
WE DO NEED A NEW G.Y.N.

21:53.867 --> 21:54.800
RIGHT.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.133
AND ADDISON SEEMS...

21:57.167 --> 21:59.100
***

21:59.133 --> 22:01.833
OH. NUH-UNH. NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

22:01.867 --> 22:02.800
WHAT?

22:02.833 --> 22:04.433
ADDISON IS A NICE PERSON.

22:04.467 --> 22:06.200
SHE IS A DECENT PERSON.

22:06.233 --> 22:08.267
SHE IS A PERSON.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.167
I'M LOOKIN' FOR A PERSON.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.533
MAN, YOU'RE JUST LOOKING.

22:11.567 --> 22:13.067
AT LEAST I'M TRYING.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.833
DR. FEELGOOD.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.800
HEY.
I LOVE YOU.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.333
HI. THANK YOU.

22:18.367 --> 22:21.233
OKAY, DR. FEELGOOD,
THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

22:21.267 --> 22:22.600
YOUR CAREER IS TAKING OFF,

22:22.633 --> 22:25.067
GIRLS LIKE THAT ARE
THROWING THEMSELVES AT YOU.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.433
YOU SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.

22:26.467 --> 22:28.367
CELEBRATING?
I JUST GOT A DIVORCE.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.300
YOU GOT A LITTLE TINY DOG,

22:30.333 --> 22:32.733
AND YOU COOK IT CHICKEN,
AND YOU TALK TO IT.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.667
THAT'S NOT NORMAL.
HEY, EASY. ALL RIGHT?

22:34.700 --> 22:37.533
I'M ALONE BECAUSE I CHOOSE
TO BE. IT'S--IT'S A CHOICE.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.767
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE
NOT INTERESTED IN ADDISON,

22:39.800 --> 22:41.300
BUT I CAN'T HAVE HER.

22:41.333 --> 22:44.333
SEE, ADDISON ISN'T THE TYPE
OF WOMAN YOU HAVE.

22:44.367 --> 22:46.267
SHE'S A MARRIAGE WOMAN.
ALL RIGHT?

22:46.300 --> 22:49.067
SHE'S GONNA WANT A COMMITMENT,
AND YOU--
HEY, I DO NOT SLEEP AROUND.

22:49.067 --> 22:52.100
NO. YOU ARE
A SERIAL MONOGAMIST, ALL RIGHT?

22:52.133 --> 22:52.933
YOU--YOU DATE A GIRL,
YOU ROMANCE A GIRL,

22:52.967 --> 22:53.700
AND THEN WHEN IT'S TIME
TO COMMIT,

22:53.733 --> 22:55.767
YOU CUT AND YOU RUN.
I DO NOT.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.133
LINDA, UH, KAREN,
UH, JULIE.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.067
THEN THERE WAS TRICIA,
AMY, CARRIE,

22:59.100 --> 23:00.833
THE OTHER LINDA--
WE CAN'T FORGET--

23:00.867 --> 23:02.767
FINE. I WON'T ASK HER OUT.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.100
GOOD BOY.
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

23:07.133 --> 23:09.200
(Naomi) AND THE WEEK BEFORE
I IMPLANTED THE EMBRYO,

23:09.233 --> 23:11.133
YOU SLEPT WITH HOW MANY,
THREE?

23:11.167 --> 23:12.667
THREE MEN.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.067
WE'RE ALMOST DONE HERE, LISA,

23:14.067 --> 23:15.667
AND THEN WE'LL DO
THE AMNIOCENTESIS.
YOU'RE ON CAROL'S SIDE.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.067
I'M CAROL'S DOCTOR.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.200
YOU CAME TO US.
YOU APPLIED TO BE A SURROGATE.

23:19.233 --> 23:21.667
IT WAS YOUR CHOICE.
I KNOW. I JUST--

23:21.700 --> 23:24.400
I WAS ABOUT
TO HAND MY BODY OVER

23:24.433 --> 23:26.733
TO A BABY THAT'S NOT MINE
FOR NINE MONTHS,

23:26.767 --> 23:29.200
WHICH IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.300
THAT... HIT ME--

23:31.333 --> 23:32.800
THE RESPONSIBILITY--

23:32.833 --> 23:35.700
AND I JUST... (sighs)

23:35.733 --> 23:37.767
THEY ALL WANTED ME.
(chuckles)

23:37.800 --> 23:39.700
ME.

23:39.733 --> 23:42.600
AND F-FOR ONCE,
I JUST STOPPED THINKING

23:42.633 --> 23:45.467
AND I JUST...

23:45.500 --> 23:47.433
I DID SOMETHING WILD.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.200
(monitor beeps)

23:49.233 --> 23:50.300
(Addison types)

23:50.333 --> 23:51.633
(monitor beeps)

23:51.667 --> 23:54.100
DR. MONTGOMERY,
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

23:54.133 --> 23:56.233
I'M GONNA RUN
SOME MORE TESTS.

24:00.567 --> 24:02.467
YOU PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TAKE IT EASY.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.400
MM-HMM. I HAVE A STACK
OF DVDs TO WATCH,

24:04.433 --> 24:06.500
AND I EXPECT YOUR FATHER
TO FEED ME BY HAND.

24:06.533 --> 24:09.333
(chuckles) UH, WELL.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.367
SO JUST CALL IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.233
IT WAS NICE T-TALKING
WITH YOU.

24:16.267 --> 24:17.200
BYE.

24:17.233 --> 24:18.700
(Susan) BYE.

24:18.733 --> 24:20.133
BYE-BYE.

24:22.567 --> 24:24.633
(elevator bell dings)

24:32.500 --> 24:34.400
ANY NEWS
ABOUT MERCY WEST?

24:34.433 --> 24:36.333
UH, THERE'S A SPOT.

24:36.367 --> 24:39.233
THERE'S A LOT OF TAKERS,
BUT THEY SAID IT LOOKS GOOD.

24:39.267 --> 24:40.833
SO AFTER THE INTERN EXAM--

24:40.867 --> 24:45.633
I'M NOT AN UNFAITHFUL GUY.
I'M NOT A CHEATER.

24:45.667 --> 24:49.100
YOU THINK IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN
IF YOU STAY HERE...
NO.

24:49.133 --> 24:50.700
WITH ME?
I DON'T KNOW.

24:50.733 --> 24:52.733
GEORGE.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.767
I HAVE TO GO.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.367
(elevator door closes)

24:58.400 --> 24:59.833
SAM.
YEAH.

24:59.867 --> 25:02.167
SO PAUL AND KATHY,
I GAVE THEM AN ASSIGNMENT.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.800
I TOLD 'EM TO DO IT.
HE DIDN'T RISE TO THE OCCASION.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.833
NOTHING? NO WOOD.

25:06.867 --> 25:08.500
NOT EVEN A TWIG.

25:08.533 --> 25:10.767
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
PHYSICAL GOING ON, RIGHT?

25:10.800 --> 25:12.433
BECAUSE THE ONLY OTHER OPTION--

25:12.467 --> 25:14.433
THAT HE JUST DOESN'T
LOVE HER ANYMORE--

25:14.467 --> 25:15.500
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST...

25:15.533 --> 25:16.833
NOT THE ONLY OPTION.

25:16.867 --> 25:19.567
I MEAN, DID THEY MEET IN
THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT IN COLLEGE?

25:19.600 --> 25:21.633
COULD BE A THYROID THING,
ANEMIA.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.133
COULD BE A BUNCH OF STUFF.
HAVE YOU CHECKED
FOR EXTREME UGLINESS?

25:24.167 --> 25:26.667
OKAY, NOT FUNNY.
WILL YOU GET BACK TO ME...
YES, I WILL.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.600
WITH WHAT YOU FIND SOON? OKAY.
YES.

25:28.633 --> 25:30.767
AND, COOPER, YOU KNOW WHAT?
UGLY PEOPLE HAVE SEX, COOPER.
EW.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.667
UGLY PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE, TOO.
OKAY.
OKAY.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.067
(elevator bell dings)

25:35.067 --> 25:37.700
(sighs)

25:37.733 --> 25:41.200
(elevator whirring)

25:41.233 --> 25:42.533
HELLO?

25:45.200 --> 25:46.467
HELLO?

25:48.200 --> 25:50.133
HELLO?

25:51.367 --> 25:53.267
HELLO?

25:54.833 --> 25:56.500
(sighs)

25:56.533 --> 25:57.667
(elevator bell dings)

25:57.700 --> 26:00.533
YOU FILL OUT
THIS E.E.G. REQUEST ON AVA?

26:00.567 --> 26:01.733
YEAH, YOU ASKED FOR IT.

26:01.767 --> 26:04.533
I ASKED YOU TO RUN LABS
ON HER EVERY OTHER DAY.

26:04.567 --> 26:06.367
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
SHEPHERD'S DOING A FULL
NEURO WORKUP.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.067
JUST GET THE HELL OF MY--

26:08.067 --> 26:11.200
GO AHEAD. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
AN EXCUSE TO LAY YOU OUT.

26:11.233 --> 26:12.633
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.133
WHATEVER YOU DIDN'T DO

26:14.167 --> 26:16.067
SENT ADDISON
RUNNING FOR THE HILLS.

26:23.567 --> 26:28.200
OKAY, THIS GUY IS 6'2",
DARK HAIR, GREEN EYES,

26:28.233 --> 26:30.133
TOTALLY HEALTHY.

26:30.167 --> 26:32.333
HE PLAYS THE VIOLIN,
AND HE'S A PHYSICIST.

26:32.367 --> 26:34.267
THAT IS GOOD SPERM.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.433
GEEKY, BUT, UH, GOOD.

26:36.467 --> 26:39.067
LISA HAS EXTRA DONORS
IF YOU WANT TO BORROW ONE.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.067
OH.

26:40.067 --> 26:41.233
HER TESTS COME IN YET?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.767
NO, TOMORROW.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.600
I DON'T WANT TO RING
ANY ALARM BELLS TILL WE'RE SURE.

26:45.633 --> 26:48.500
OOH. WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?
HE'S A MARINE BIOLOGIST.

26:48.533 --> 26:49.700
GOOD HAIR.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.700
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS,

26:51.733 --> 26:53.400
HAVE A BABY?

26:53.433 --> 26:55.300
YOUR LIFE
IS REALLY GONNA CHANGE.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.100
THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS.

26:57.133 --> 26:58.700
I WANT MY LIFE TO CHANGE.

26:58.733 --> 27:01.567
I NEED... MY LIFE TO CHANGE.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.067
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU HAVE MAYA.
YOU'RE LUCKY.

27:05.067 --> 27:07.533
YOU DID EVERYTHING
THE WAY YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO.

27:07.567 --> 27:09.500
YOU DIDN'T WAIT.

27:09.533 --> 27:11.333
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.

27:11.367 --> 27:12.400
***

27:12.433 --> 27:14.433
WAITED.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.467
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:16.500 --> 27:18.167
(sighs) ADDISON,
I DID EVERYTHING

27:18.200 --> 27:20.233
EXACTLY THE WAY
I WAS SUPPOSED TO.

27:20.267 --> 27:22.367
AFTER COLLEGE, I NEVER DATED
ANYBODY BUT SAM,

27:22.400 --> 27:24.733
BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE.

27:24.767 --> 27:27.433
I NEVER HAD SEX
WITH ANYBODY BUT SAM

27:27.467 --> 27:28.633
BECAUSE CHEATING IS WRONG.

27:28.667 --> 27:30.300
I HAD A BABY BECAUSE...

27:30.333 --> 27:33.467
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED.

27:33.500 --> 27:37.100
I NEVER MADE A SINGLE MISTAKE.
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.600
AND THEN SAM COMES HOME
AND SAYS HE WANTS A DIVORCE.

27:39.633 --> 27:43.367
SO ALL THOSE PHOTOS YOU'RE...
BUSY ADMIRING,

27:43.400 --> 27:45.067
ALL THEY ARE
ARE REMINDERS

27:45.100 --> 27:47.533
OF ALL THE STUFF
I DIDN'T DO.

27:47.567 --> 27:48.733
I'M 38 YEARS OLD,

27:48.767 --> 27:50.667
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HAVE FUN.

27:50.700 --> 27:52.633
THAT'S NOT LUCKY.
THAT'S SAD.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.667
SO JUST...
SHUT UP ABOUT LUCKY!

27:54.700 --> 27:58.700
***

27:58.733 --> 28:01.633
POOR... SAD...

28:01.667 --> 28:04.400
DRIED UP NAOMI.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.200
SHUT UP.

28:06.233 --> 28:09.133
POOR LITTLE, SPECIAL

28:09.167 --> 28:11.067
TALENTED DOCTOR GIRL.
(laughs)

28:11.100 --> 28:12.833
LET'S MAKE
A MADE-FOR-TV MOVIE...
(laughs)

28:12.867 --> 28:16.667
ABOUT THE POOR LITTLE,
DRIED UP SPECIAL GIRL

28:16.700 --> 28:18.433
WHO HAS NO FUN.

28:18.467 --> 28:21.467
I COULD PUT YOU OUT.
YOU'D HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE CAR.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.267
I JUST... (sighs)

28:24.300 --> 28:26.833
I JUST WISH I'D BEEN
A LITTLE MORE LIKE YOU.

28:26.867 --> 28:30.267
WHAT, AN ADULTEROUS BITCH
WHO FORGOT TO HAVE KIDS?

28:30.300 --> 28:33.800
***

28:46.500 --> 28:50.133
***

28:50.167 --> 28:52.067
VIOLET?

28:54.300 --> 28:56.333
ALLAN.
HEY!

28:56.367 --> 28:58.433
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
HOW YOU DOING?

28:58.467 --> 29:00.600
I'M GREAT. REALLY.
I'M REALLY WONDERFUL.

29:00.633 --> 29:04.467
WELL, I SAW YOU AND I--
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.400
SO I HOPE IT'S OKAY.
(laughs)

29:06.433 --> 29:07.667
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST...

29:07.700 --> 29:10.133
IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU.

29:10.167 --> 29:11.300
YOU LOOK, UH...

29:11.333 --> 29:13.700
YOU LOOK REALLY WONDERFUL.

29:13.733 --> 29:16.300
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE GOUDA YOU LIKE,

29:16.333 --> 29:18.200
BUT THEY HAD
A CAMEMBERT--HI.

29:18.233 --> 29:19.633
HI.

29:19.667 --> 29:20.833
THIS IS VIOLET.

29:20.867 --> 29:23.133
VIOLET--OH, VIOLET.
YEAH.

29:23.167 --> 29:24.733
HI.

29:24.767 --> 29:26.733
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I-I'M CAMI.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.433
OKAY.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.100
ALLAN'S WIFE.

29:30.133 --> 29:34.567
(laughs) GOD, I STILL CAN'T
GET USED TO THAT WORD--WIFE.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.500
(laughs) YEAH.

29:36.533 --> 29:37.767
WIFE?

29:37.800 --> 29:41.100
***

29:41.133 --> 29:43.167
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED?

29:43.200 --> 29:46.100
NEWLYWEDS--
EIGHT WEEKS.

29:46.133 --> 29:49.267
OH.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.267
CONGRATULATIONS.

29:51.300 --> 29:55.367
***

29:55.400 --> 29:57.333
WE'LL SEE YOU.

29:57.367 --> 30:00.833
(Cami) NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:00.867 --> 30:04.067
***

30:23.267 --> 30:24.633
(Cooper)
HEY, ADDISON, UH, LATTE?

30:24.667 --> 30:26.533
OR AC--MORE OF
A CAPPUCCINO.

30:26.567 --> 30:29.267
LISA'S BABY HAS SOMETHING
CALLED PLACENTA ACCRETA.

30:29.300 --> 30:30.767
IS THAT BAD?

30:30.800 --> 30:33.667
THE PLACENTA ABNORMALLY
ATTACHES TO THE UTERINE WALL.

30:33.700 --> 30:36.600
IT MAKES DELIVERING DANGEROUS
FOR BOTH MOM AND BABY.

30:36.633 --> 30:39.467
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.533
THE BABY HAS
SOME GENETIC MARKERS

30:41.567 --> 30:43.300
THAT DON'T MATCH CAROL,
JUST LISA.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.567
WHAT? THE EMBRYO--

30:45.600 --> 30:47.467
DID NOT IMPLANT.
THIS IS LISA'S BABY?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
WHICH ALSO MEANS
THAT THE PATERNITY

30:49.533 --> 30:51.433
IS ONCE AGAIN UP FOR GRABS.

30:51.467 --> 30:53.033
GOOD LUCK.

30:53.067 --> 30:54.133
I'M OFF TO THE BEACH.

30:54.167 --> 30:57.600
UH, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
SOMEONE HAS TO TELL THE PATIENT.

30:57.633 --> 31:00.067
HONESTLY, I HA--I HAVE...
(clears throat)

31:00.100 --> 31:02.500
LOW PEOPLE SKILLS
WITH ANYBODY OVER 12.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.733
IT--IT'S TRUE.

31:03.767 --> 31:05.667
AN INTERNET HOOKER
JUST STOLE HIS CAR--

31:05.700 --> 31:08.467
VIOLET! PRIVACY.
SHE WAS NOT--SHE JUST...

31:08.500 --> 31:10.267
SHE BORROWED MY CAR.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.100
MM-HMM.

31:12.133 --> 31:13.300
(Naomi and Violet laugh)

31:13.333 --> 31:16.233
SHE--SHE BORROWED IT.
BORROWED.
OKAY.

31:19.167 --> 31:22.133
911 TURBO,

31:22.167 --> 31:24.567
HAND-SEWN LEATHER SEATS.

31:26.633 --> 31:29.367
911 TURBO
WITH HAND-SEWN LEATHER SEATS.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.200
WHO DOES THAT TO A 911?

31:32.233 --> 31:34.100
A CHICK. A CRAZY CHICK.

31:34.133 --> 31:35.467
BUT SHE WAS SO HOT.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.833
A CRAZY HOT CHICK.

31:36.867 --> 31:38.233
I LOVED THAT CAR.

31:38.267 --> 31:40.167
THAT WAS A SINGLE MAN'S CAR.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.067
THAT'S THE POINT.
I MEAN, I--

31:42.100 --> 31:45.533
I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS DONE
BEING SINGLE.

31:45.567 --> 31:48.500
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA BE
THE MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN.

31:48.533 --> 31:51.300
WHAT WAS HER NAME AGAIN?
SexyBoobs316.

31:53.300 --> 31:54.367
(mutters)

31:54.400 --> 31:56.067
ARE YOU...

31:56.100 --> 31:58.333
DUDE, ARE YOU CRYING?

31:58.367 --> 31:59.400
NO.

31:59.433 --> 32:01.333
YOU BETTER BE CRYING
ABOUT THAT CAR

32:01.367 --> 32:04.067
AND NOT OVER SexyBoobs315.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.533
I CAN'T. I-I CAN'T.
I'M GONNA HURT HIM.

32:08.567 --> 32:12.767
LET'S JUST SAY HE'S CRYING
OVER THE CAR AND THE WOMAN.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.300
ALL RIGHT? THERE WE GO.
LET IT OUT.
(exhales sharply)

32:16.333 --> 32:18.467
LET IT OUT.

32:21.533 --> 32:24.067
UH, CRISTINA?

32:28.833 --> 32:31.433
OOH.
THAT'S A PRETTY ONE.

32:31.467 --> 32:34.567
MM. MOVES VERY WELL IN IT.
LOOKS QUITE NATURAL.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.067
YOU PAGED?

32:36.100 --> 32:37.833
(low voice)
I NEED YOU OVER HERE.

32:37.867 --> 32:39.367
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.333
SHOULD I BE SEEING YOU IN
THE DRESS BEFORE THE WEDDING?

32:42.367 --> 32:44.267
YOU THINK I'M WEARING THIS?

32:44.300 --> 32:46.300
WELL...

32:46.333 --> 32:48.233
WELL, IT IS VERY FEMININE.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.100
EXACTLY.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.133
DO YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER
BOOKED A CHAPEL

32:51.167 --> 32:53.567
THAT SITS 200 PEOPLE?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.767
OKAY, HOW DID I
GET BRIDESMAIDS, HUH?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.333
(normal voice) FREAKIN' STUPID

32:58.367 --> 33:00.267
COTTON-CANDY COLORED
BRIDESMAIDS? NO OFFENSE.

33:00.300 --> 33:03.233
(lowered voice) WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR SMALL CEREMONY?

33:03.267 --> 33:05.433
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND ME
AT CITY HALL?

33:05.467 --> 33:09.133
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE SERIOUS.
(pager beeps)

33:09.167 --> 33:12.100
(Callie)
I AM NOT WEARING THIS.

33:12.133 --> 33:14.067
OH, I GOTTA GET
TO THE HOSPITAL.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.800
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD, UH,
GIVE 'EM SOME PRIVACY.

33:16.833 --> 33:18.500
WHAT?

33:19.767 --> 33:22.400
OH! OH, YOU WANT ME TO GO
OVER THERE WITH YOU...

33:22.433 --> 33:24.433
BY MYSELF.

33:24.467 --> 33:26.133
YEAH.
OKAY.

33:26.167 --> 33:28.167
OKAY.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.533
YOU WANT A BIG WEDDING?

33:29.567 --> 33:31.467
YOU WANT THE CHAPEL,
YOU WANT THE GUESTS

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
AND ME IN A WHITE DRESS?

33:33.533 --> 33:35.400
WELL...

33:35.433 --> 33:36.667
YES.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.600
I'M A TRADITIONAL MAN,
CRISTINA.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.500
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
NO.

33:46.433 --> 33:48.167
OH.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.367
THE SALESLADY HAS
ANOTHER BATCH OF DRESSES

33:50.400 --> 33:53.067
FOR YOU TO SEE, CRISTINA.

33:53.067 --> 33:57.133
OH, THANK YOU... MAMA.

34:01.133 --> 34:05.400
CRISTINA HAS CERTAINLY
MADE QUITE AN EFFORT.

34:05.433 --> 34:07.733
TRIED ON, I WOULD SAY,
OVER A HUNDRED DRESSES,

34:07.767 --> 34:11.233
AND THAT CERTAINLY COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN EASY FOR HER.

34:11.267 --> 34:12.433
YEAH, MAMA, I KNOW

34:12.467 --> 34:14.367
SHE SEEMS DISINTERESTED
IN WEDDING PLANNING.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.333
BUT CRISTINA...

34:16.367 --> 34:18.067
SHE'S NOT COLD.

34:18.067 --> 34:19.433
I KNOW SHE SEEMS COLD--

34:19.467 --> 34:20.633
PRESTON...

34:20.667 --> 34:23.567
IF YOU THINK CRISTINA
IS RIGHT FOR YOU,

34:23.600 --> 34:25.800
I TRUST YOU.

34:25.833 --> 34:28.633
I TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.167
(Carol) AND THE BABY--

34:43.200 --> 34:45.100
THE, UM,
THE BABY ISN'T EVEN MINE?

34:45.133 --> 34:47.067
HONEY, CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN?

34:47.067 --> 34:49.767
YOU MEAN I CAN KEEP THIS BABY
IF I WANT TO?

34:49.800 --> 34:51.767
UH, LEGALLY, YES.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.700
SO WHO'S THE FATHER?

34:53.733 --> 34:56.067
WE WON'T KNOW THE PATERNITY
OF THE BABY

34:56.100 --> 34:59.467
TILL AFTER LISA DELIVERS.
MORE URGENT AT THE MOMENT
IS THE PLACENTA ACCRETA.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.567
THE FACT IS, LISA IS AT RISK

35:01.600 --> 35:04.200
OF HAVING
A LIFE-THREATENING HEMORRHAGE

35:04.233 --> 35:06.500
AND THE BABY
COULD DELIVER PRETERM.

35:06.533 --> 35:08.467
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THEY COULD DIE?

35:08.500 --> 35:10.567
THERE IS A RISK
OF DEATH, YES.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.100
LISA,
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

35:14.133 --> 35:15.767
IF YOU DO GO
INTO PRETERM LABOR,

35:15.800 --> 35:17.700
YOU'LL HAVE A C-SECTION.

35:17.733 --> 35:19.667
AND THEY'LL MONITOR IT
AND CONTROL IT

35:19.700 --> 35:20.800
SO THAT THEY HAVE

35:20.833 --> 35:23.600
A BETTER CHANCE OF SAVING
YOUR UTERUS AND YOUR LIFE.

35:23.633 --> 35:26.200
AND YOU'LL SAVE US,
ME AND THE BABY?

35:26.233 --> 35:28.700
WELL, I HAVE...
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO SEATTLE.

35:28.733 --> 35:31.600
I HAVE A PRACTICE. BUT I CAN
REFER YOU TO SOMEONE LOCAL WHO--

35:31.633 --> 35:34.067
NO, I WANT YOU.
YOU BE THERE.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.800
I THOUGHT KATHY WAS COMING
TO THE APPOINTMENT TODAY.

35:46.833 --> 35:48.700
(sobbing)
OH.

35:48.733 --> 35:51.333
JUST--KATHY DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

35:51.367 --> 35:53.267
AND, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T BLAME HER,

35:53.300 --> 35:55.200
BUT IT'S JUST...

35:55.233 --> 35:57.767
WHAT--WHAT IF SHE'S WITH
SOME GUY RIGHT NOW?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.800
SOME GUY--SOME--SOME GUY
WHO CAN... WHO CAN BRING IT?

36:00.833 --> 36:02.733
OKAY. LET'S NOT
GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

36:02.767 --> 36:05.067
IT'S OKAY. ALL RIGHT?

36:05.100 --> 36:07.700
THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEDICAL
REASONS FOR LOW SEX DRIVE.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.333
ALL RIGHT?
SORRY. SORRY.

36:10.367 --> 36:12.367
HONEY...
WHERE WERE YOU?

36:12.400 --> 36:15.133
I WAS OUT.

36:15.167 --> 36:16.667
ALL NIGHT?

36:16.700 --> 36:17.833
MM-HMM.

36:17.867 --> 36:20.733
AND I HAD A CHANCE TO CHEAT,
BELIEVE ME.

36:20.767 --> 36:22.067
BUT I PASSED. OKAY?

36:22.067 --> 36:25.767
I PASSED UP BEING WITH SOMEONE
WHO ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE WITH ME

36:25.800 --> 36:27.800
BECAUSE I AM STUCK WITH YOU.
(crying)

36:27.833 --> 36:29.633
YOU'RE CRYING?

36:29.667 --> 36:31.667
OKAY, LET'S--LET'S ALL
JUST CALM DOWN HERE.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.567
ALL RIGHT--
I'LL BE
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.500
OH! SHE'S STARTING
TO HATE ME.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.300
(sobs)

36:37.333 --> 36:40.200
OH.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO IF
LITTLE PAUL CAN'T PERFORM?

36:40.233 --> 36:41.300
OKAY.

36:41.333 --> 36:44.200
DON'T TALK ABOUT YOUR PENIS
WHILE YOU HUG ANOTHER MAN.

36:44.233 --> 36:45.733
I'M SORRY, MAN.
IT'S OKAY.

36:45.767 --> 36:47.667
I'M SORRY.
LET'S DRAW SOME BLOOD.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.567
OKAY,
LET'S DRAW SOME BLOOD.

36:53.467 --> 36:54.800
WHAT'S IN L.A.?

36:54.833 --> 36:56.567
WHAT?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.233
FOR ADDISON.

36:58.267 --> 37:00.167
ANY IDEA...

37:00.200 --> 37:02.100
WHAT SHE MIGHT
BE DOING THERE?

37:02.133 --> 37:04.600
UH... NAOMI AND SAM
ARE DOWN THERE, I GUESS.

37:04.633 --> 37:06.133
I DON'T KNOW.

37:06.167 --> 37:08.200
YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:08.233 --> 37:10.567
WE WERE GONNA TRY.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.067
WE WERE GONNA MAKE
A GO OF IT...

37:13.100 --> 37:15.567
AS A COUPLE.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.500
SHE BET ME I COULDN'T GO
60 DAYS WITHOUT HAVING SEX.

37:18.533 --> 37:21.733
OH. LET ME GUESS.
YOU COULDN'T DO IT.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.200
NO, SHE COULDN'T.

37:26.633 --> 37:29.133
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
WITH ME.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.433
I THOUGHT SHE DID.

37:31.467 --> 37:33.633
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.500
BUT SHE DIDN'T.

37:37.867 --> 37:40.633
AND I CAUGHT HER.
YOU KNOW...

37:40.667 --> 37:42.333
SLEEPING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

37:42.367 --> 37:43.467
(snickers)

37:43.500 --> 37:46.333
OH, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO HARD FOR YOU.

37:46.367 --> 37:47.300
(chuckles)

37:47.333 --> 37:49.233
NOT THAT I CAN'T RELATE.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.533
SO I TOLD HER I DID IT.

37:51.567 --> 37:54.167
YOU TOLD HER YOU DID IT?

37:54.200 --> 37:57.233
I TOLD HER I LOST THE BET.
I TOLD HER I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

37:57.267 --> 38:00.133
I FIGURED IF SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME,

38:00.167 --> 38:02.067
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.067
SELFLESS. THAT'S...
OUT OF CHARACTER.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.767
YEAH.

38:07.800 --> 38:11.633
ANYWAY, UH...

38:11.667 --> 38:14.500
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU KNEW WHAT WAS IN L.A.

38:14.533 --> 38:18.367
NO. (sighs)

38:21.300 --> 38:24.833
OKAY, NOW I AM GOING
TO THE BEACH.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.767
WAIT, ADDIE.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.700
YOUR TEST RESULTS
CAME BACK IN.

38:28.733 --> 38:30.233
OH, GOOD.

38:30.267 --> 38:32.167
BECAUSE, UM,
I PICKED A DONOR.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.067
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
WITH PHYSICIST GUY.

38:34.067 --> 38:37.100
YOUR F.S.H. LEVEL IS HIGH.

38:37.133 --> 38:38.700
WELL,
THEY'RE HIGH THIS MONTH.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.633
WE CAN DO, UH,
OVARIAN STIMULATION.

38:40.667 --> 38:43.533
AND YOUR ANTRAL FOLLICLE COUNT
IS ONLY TWO.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.400
THAT COULD BE DUE TO STRESS.

38:48.433 --> 38:49.767
ADDISON, I'M SORRY.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.700
I DID ALL THE TESTS.

38:51.733 --> 38:54.233
THERE'S NO
FERTILITY POTENTIAL HERE.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.767
(laughs)

38:59.800 --> 39:01.133
OKAY.

39:01.167 --> 39:03.667
UH...

39:03.700 --> 39:06.600
THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS, UM...

39:06.633 --> 39:08.833
OH, THIS IS JUST... PERFECT.

39:08.867 --> 39:10.167
ADDISON--

39:10.200 --> 39:11.667
I HAVE THE GREAT GUY.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.533
I DON'T HAVE A BABY BECAUSE
I'M FOCUSING ON MY CAREER.

39:14.567 --> 39:16.267
AND THEN I HAVE THE OTHER GUY.

39:16.300 --> 39:19.267
I DON'T HAVE HIS BABY
BECAUSE HE'S NOT THE GREAT GUY.

39:19.300 --> 39:22.167
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE
THE GREAT GUY OR THE OTHER GUY,

39:22.200 --> 39:25.067
AND I'M FINALLY READY
TO HAVE A BABY, AND I CAN'T.

39:25.100 --> 39:29.233
THAT IS SO...
EXACTLY WHAT MY LIFE IS.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.767
ADDIE,
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.333
YEAH, I KNOW
ABOUT THE OPTIONS.

39:34.367 --> 39:35.800
I'M SO SORRY.

39:35.833 --> 39:40.133
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU WANTED THIS.

39:40.167 --> 39:42.267
IT'S OKAY.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.533
I JUST, UM...

39:45.567 --> 39:48.433
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
I WAS OUT OF TIME,

39:48.467 --> 39:50.100
THAT'S ALL.

39:50.133 --> 39:52.067
***

39:52.067 --> 39:54.233
ADDIE, PLEASE STAY
SO WE CAN--

39:54.267 --> 39:55.767
NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.700
THANK YOU... FOR TELLING ME.

39:57.733 --> 40:00.600
THANK YOU.
I WILL SEE YOU AT HOME.

40:00.633 --> 40:03.733
***

40:03.767 --> 40:05.667
(elevator bell dings)

40:05.700 --> 40:09.233
***

40:09.267 --> 40:12.367
(woman) LOOKS LIKE
YOU HAD A BAD DAY.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.600
OKAY...

40:14.633 --> 40:16.167
ENOUGH.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.167
OKAY? NOT TODAY.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.100
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DAY.
ALL RIGHT?

40:20.133 --> 40:25.233
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST...
SHUT UP?

40:25.267 --> 40:28.233
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!

40:28.267 --> 40:31.133
(sobbing)

40:31.167 --> 40:34.033
***

40:36.767 --> 40:39.067
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.800
