11:16.301 --> 11:17.962
Uh, one of the phones
was Manny’s,

11:18.053 --> 11:19.884
and l was able to look
at that one.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.009
All of the voice calls
were to and from his mom.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.807
What about texts?
Michelle only texts her friends.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.850
Yeah. The bulk were
from Kat Martin,

11:27.938 --> 11:30.099
who was the girl they met
at the victim’s apartment.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.930
— Were they an item?
— I don’t think so.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.901
[ Saroyan ]
And pretty one—sided.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.697
I think he had a crush on her,
and seems like she was trying
to let him down easy.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.445
Let’s hope it was easy.
Who was the other person
he was texting?

11:42.536 --> 11:44.652
Uh, there’s no name.
It’s just a number.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.282
l’m tracing it now.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.739
Most messages are just about
where and when to meet...

11:48.834 --> 11:50.825
and then a series
of random numbers.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.752
I guess sometimes there Is
more than meets the eye.

11:53.839 --> 11:57.673
Hey, I wasn’t trying
to imply anything
about Michelle.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.213
She’s great.
Oh, you don’t
have to say that.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.132
l—l know.
But she is great though.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.758
Okay. Nick Pavonetti.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.770
I got a hit.
This is the guy
who was texting.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.734
Pavonetti & Sons.
This is your dad’s company,
right, Nick?

12:17.821 --> 12:19.857
Yeah. Yeah.
I’m one of the sons.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.280
Um, actually, here, um—

12:22.367 --> 12:25.530
It’s a coupon.
Gets you five percent off.
That’s my idea.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.493
This is about Manny,
right?
Yeah.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.412
It’s a drag,
him being dead
and everything.

12:29.499 --> 12:33.742
Yeah. Interesting, a kid
like that who didn’t have any
friends was always texting you.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.498
I felt sorry for him,
you know.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.626
l was trying to integrate him
into the community,
do my civic duty.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.091
By selling drugs?
What?

12:41.178 --> 12:43.669
Vitamin “K”? Ketamine?
K—fog?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.301
No. You—You got
the wrong idea, dude.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.475
Really? ’Cause what I have here
are a bunch of text messages
between you and Manny.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.894
Always a time
and place to meet.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.607
I’m assuming these numbers here
are prices and codes
for different drugs?

12:56.693 --> 12:58.775
What, you two
get into an argument
over money or something?

12:58.862 --> 13:00.398
No.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.105
There’s no drugs, ever,
I swear.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.612
Manny was— He was kind
of a brainiac, you know?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.409
He was always making
smart phones where you
wouldn’t get billed,

13:08.497 --> 13:11.113
chips for computers,
free downloads,
that sort of thing.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.164
So, if Manny did all the work,
what’d you do?

13:13.251 --> 13:15.913
Well, I’m a people person.
You know, I handled all the sales.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.746
We were doing pretty good too.
Almost two grand so far.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.923
A couple more months like that,
and I don’t have to work
for my dad anymore.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.126
Right. Do you know anyone
who’d want to hurt Manny?

13:24.221 --> 13:26.212
No one even knew
who he was.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.843
I wasn’t lying.
l was trying to give
this dude a social life.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.184
When was the last time
you saw him?
Party about two weekends ago.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.181
This party—
Everyone keeps
mentioning this party.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.103
It was awesome.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.182
It’s the best party
I was ever at.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.773
This could be cause of death.
I found two depressions...

13:42.864 --> 13:45.355
bilaterally on the frontal bone
and one on the left parietal.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.987
They’re shallow,
but I found them
while feeling the bones,

13:48.078 --> 13:50.069
a technique I learned
from you, ma’am.

13:50.163 --> 13:55.283
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.
They’re holding points from
a halo—traction brace.

13:55.377 --> 13:58.869
The brace is applied
to stabilize cervical vertebrae...

13:58.964 --> 14:01.501
in order to allow time
for healing.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.207
Which means they’re
the result of his car accident
when he was a sprout.

14:04.302 --> 14:08.261
A child. Can you tell me
what you see here?

14:08.390 --> 14:10.255
Osteophytes.
Precisely.

14:10.350 --> 14:14.639
You see how they’ve grown here
at the transverse foramina?

14:14.730 --> 14:17.767
Yes, they caused cervical nerves
three and four to be severed.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.266
We have cause of death—
asphyxiation.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.979
Yes. The injury would have
severed the connection
to the medulla.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.860
Which caused him to stop breathing,
but he wasn’t suffocated or strangled.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.532
That’s what
the evidence suggests.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.031
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Oh, I— | forgot.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.363
This is yours,
Mr. Abernathy.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.914
You left it
in my office.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.204
Oh, looks like Michelle
is calling you.
Thank you.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.081
— Uh, I can talk to her later.
- I don’t mind.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.288
You deserve a reward
after your excellent work.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.838
Dr. Saroyan.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.916
I’ll call her back.
It’s no— no problem.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.297
She called
quite a few times.
She must miss you.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.091
lt’s Michelle.
Oh!

14:50.182 --> 14:53.674
No. I understand.
It’s tough being away
from each other so long.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.101
Yeah. Well, fortunately,
! have my work right here, so—

14:56.188 --> 14:58.804
Good way to deal with it.
I’m impressed, Finn.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.810
Can I borrow you
for a moment, Dr. Brennan?

15:00.901 --> 15:04.519
Of course. Are you okay
to catalog our findings
in the binder?

15:04.613 --> 15:06.103
Yes. Totally fine.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.032
I’ve been going through
the victim’s computer...

15:15.123 --> 15:18.411
and looking for any online
threats or squabbles.

15:18.502 --> 15:21.915
So far there’s
nothing in any e—mails
or social network threats.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.246
Is that his girlfriend
from when they were younger?

15:24.341 --> 15:27.003
The one he wishes
was his girlfriend— Kat.

15:27.094 --> 15:30.302
I also looked
at the LP. addresses
that he visited most often.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.765
There’s computer hacking
message boards, of course,

15:32.849 --> 15:35.591
but the one that he visited
the most was this one.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.641
The Hipstashotz site.

15:37.729 --> 15:42.063
So, he was looking at pictures
of the party from the night
before he was murdered.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.232
The infamous
“awesome” party.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.311
- And who took all of these?
- Well, it’s a photo—sharing Web site,

15:47.405 --> 15:49.270
so over 50 kids uploaded these.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.324
Don’t they know
anyone can see these?

15:52.410 --> 15:55.573
Yeah, but, I mean,
what parent would want
to look at these?

15:55.705 --> 15:57.741
[ Chuckles ]
What are you
laughing at?

15:57.833 --> 15:59.414
Just reminds me
of high school.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.000
This reminds you
of high school?
Yes.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.827
In high school,
I did a report...

16:03.922 --> 16:07.130
concerning the effects of alcohol
on muscle coordination.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.832
[ Chuckling ]
It was very amusing.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.713
Can we focus on the case?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.386
Is this behavior anomalous
with your teenage experience?

16:13.473 --> 16:17.136
l have a daughter.
I’d rather not think of her
doing what I did.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.559
Cam was naughty.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.638
- The case?
- Okay. It’s fine.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.893
So, I took
his class photo...

16:24.985 --> 16:27.977
and applied
facial—recognition software
to single him out.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.824
[ Saroyan ]
He looks angry.

16:31.908 --> 16:35.150
l stitched the photos together
so we could follow him
through the night.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.827
Sort of like
a photo flip—book.

16:37.914 --> 16:41.623
There’s Kat.
She’s dancing with that guy.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.543
- Manny was jealous.
- Yeah, it gets worse.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.790
Manny was following her
around the party.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.543
[ Saroyan ]
Was he stalking her?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.295
Competition for a mate
is even more pronounced
during the teenage years...

16:51.386 --> 16:52.922
when they’re most fertile.

16:53.013 --> 16:56.597
Which led to a fight
between Manny and the boy
that was dancing with Kat.

17:00.187 --> 17:04.146
[Angela] These were some
of the last photos taken
of Manny at the party.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.478
The last of him alive.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.453
[Sighs]
It was a dull party.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.415
Nothing even
gotoutofhand.
[Booth] Dull?

17:23.501 --> 17:25.958
What?
You don’t like my moves?

17:26.046 --> 17:28.287
The girl you’re dancing with
is 15 years old.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.124
That’s not what she said.
Besides, there’s no age rules
about dancing.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.426
You know this boy?
No.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.925
You’re gonna say no when I got
a picture of the two of you
arguing right here?

17:38.016 --> 17:39.972
I mean, I don’t know
his name or anything.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.392
The kid goes to my school.
That’s all.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.720
What’s this about?
I didn’t hit him or anything.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.975
I’m starting to feel like you
think I did something wrong.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.353
Kid’s name is Martin Manicone,
all right?

17:49.486 --> 17:52.273
Kids calls him Manny.
I’ll keep that in mind
next party.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.980
He was murdered.
Right now, you’re a suspect.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.525
Me? Why?
Oh, I don’t know.
A photo, fighting.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.404
Should I get a lawyer?
You need a lawyer?

18:01.498 --> 18:04.160
No, time out.
I’ll tell you straight up
what I know.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.412
Great, ’cause we like it
straight up here at the FBI.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.619
I’m a senior, right?

18:10.715 --> 18:14.253
She asked me to dance.
Happens all the time.
She wants an upgrade.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.093
And you like that?
Who wouldn’t?

18:17.180 --> 18:20.764
But your boy here, he comes in
and shoves me off and yells at me.

18:20.892 --> 18:25.181
And you didn’t do anything?
I went, got myself a drink
and asked a senior to dance.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.770
And before that,
what did the girl do?
She yelled at him.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.441
Everybody heard.
She said she hated him
and she wished he was dead.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.189
Hmm.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.941
I don’t think she meant it
though, right?

18:35.031 --> 18:36.942
I mean, it’s just one of
those things a girl says.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.615
You know, like, “Drop dead.”

18:39.703 --> 18:41.819
Right. You get that a lot, right?

18:41.913 --> 18:44.996
Doesn’t stop me, man.
Doesn’t even slow me down.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.294
Six avulsion fractures
that present symmetrically...

18:51.381 --> 18:53.292
and nearly parallel
to one another...

18:53.383 --> 18:56.170
here, here and here.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.884
No remodeling.
No, ma’am.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.381
Indicating that these injuries
were likely sustained...

18:59.472 --> 19:00.882
after the victim
was already dead.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.057
We knew that from the suitcase
striking boats and rocks.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.975
But these—

19:08.064 --> 19:11.056
Spider fracturing like this
can only be caused
by compression.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.813
But since the injuries
aren’t spread out over
the surrounding bones,

19:13.903 --> 19:15.985
it’s not just a factor
of being put in the case.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.485
Let’s catalog the injuries
and get a rough time line of
when they might have occurred.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.238
Whether antemortem,
time of death, postmortem?
Got it.

19:22.329 --> 19:25.947
[Sighs ] What kind
of trouble could a kid
in high school get into...

19:26.041 --> 19:28.783
that ends with him
stuffed in a suitcase
and tossed off a bridge?

19:28.877 --> 19:30.993
As a former
juvenile delinquent,

19:31.087 --> 19:35.080
I’d assume you have a string
of bad decisions behind you.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.665
Yes, ma’am.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.423
I just wish all of them
were behind me.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.189
Dr. Sweets?

19:50.273 --> 19:51.729
Kat. Hi.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.477
— Uh, I can take it from here.
- Okay.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.566
Thanks.
You remember me?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.781
Yeah. Agent Booth and I were
meaning to talk to you again.
Please sit down.

20:01.451 --> 20:05.535
This is weird,
but you said I could
come talk to you, right?

20:05.622 --> 20:08.705
— Of course.
— The thing is...

20:08.792 --> 20:11.204
it’s private, and I don’t
want anyone to know.

20:11.294 --> 20:13.910
Is this about your argument with Manny
before he was killed?

20:14.005 --> 20:17.623
It’s all right. I mean,
in a murder investigation,
everything comes to light.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.718
If I tell you,
and you’re a psychologist,

20:22.806 --> 20:25.218
you can’t tell anyone else,
right?

20:25.308 --> 20:27.048
[Sighs]

20:27.143 --> 20:30.635
Uh, not quite. I mean,
I’m not your psychologist.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.345
Why not?

20:33.691 --> 20:35.682
Why don’t you just
trust my judgment?

20:35.777 --> 20:39.190
I will not tell anyone anything
they don’t need to know.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.481
— Promise?
— I promise.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.198
l was raped.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.699
At that party, I think.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.502
I remember being at the party,
and then I woke up at home...

20:59.592 --> 21:01.583
and...

21:01.678 --> 21:03.168
I knew.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.890
People will wonder
how you knew for sure.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.724
I was a virgin.

21:13.815 --> 21:16.682
There was blood.
I’m not a virgin anymore.

21:18.236 --> 21:19.726
I’m sorry.

21:21.364 --> 21:25.232
[ Sniffling ]
All I remember
is one green eye.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.113
l have nightmares
about one green eye.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.581
And you decided
not to call the police.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.371
My mom said not to.

21:34.085 --> 21:37.293
She said if! didn’t know
who did it, then...

21:37.380 --> 21:39.041
it was my fault.

21:39.132 --> 21:42.465
No, rape is never
the victim’s fault.
Never

21:42.552 --> 21:45.294
And the fact that
you don’t remember it,
it might suggest...

21:45.388 --> 21:48.221
that either you were
unconscious or on drugs.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.800
I didn’t take anything.
Maybe someone roofied me.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.682
You know, Special “K”
can have that effect.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.263
I don’t know anything
about Special “K.”

21:57.358 --> 22:01.146
We have reason to believe that
Manny had access to the drug.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.898
I don’t know.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.200
Lately, he got all—

22:07.452 --> 22:10.285
The way he looked at me
changed,and—

22:10.371 --> 22:13.829
No! No, Manny would never
do anything like that.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.408
Drug me and rape me?

22:16.503 --> 22:19.040
We’ve known each other
since we were kids.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.212
Wait right here, okay?
I’ll be—

22:25.303 --> 22:27.715
I’ll be right back.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.601
Cam says that the ketamine
wasn’t present
in the victim’s liver.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.678
And this means something
to me because—

22:36.773 --> 22:40.186
Manny didn’t ingest the drug.
It means that the pills
were on him, not in him.

22:40.276 --> 22:43.814
Hodgins found remnants
of a sandwich bag
inside the suitcase.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.691
Sounds more and more
like a drug deal gone bad.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.524
l have noticed that
a disproportionate percentage
of drug dealers...

22:48.618 --> 22:50.279
end up as homicide victims.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.361
Oh, man.
Hey, Dr. Brennan.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.320
— Hi.
- “Oh, man” what?

22:54.415 --> 22:57.373
Turns out Kat Martin
was raped at the party.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.872
- Well, was she drugged?
- How did you know?

23:00.004 --> 23:02.711
Well, it looks like Manny
was dealing ketamine.
Oh, man.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.752
How do you know
that she was raped?
She’s in my office right now.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.298
Without her mother?
That’s correct.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.050
— She said she was raped?
- Yeah.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.132
- Her mom told her
not to tell anyone.
- What?

23:14.227 --> 23:16.809
You are aware that you
can’t question a juvenile
without a parent present?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.888
I... made sure not to
ask a single question.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.895
Um, I was very careful,
and I recorded
the entire conversation.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.648
That’s a technicality.
You’re playing with fire.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.275
Being raped—
that could give Kat
a motive for murder.

23:28.366 --> 23:31.278
Okay, the victim was in
possession of date—rape drugs.
Kat was raped.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.485
Let’s do the math here, people.
It’s kind of simple.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.242
She doesn’t know
who raped her.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.574
- Who else has she told?
— Just me and the mother.

23:39.669 --> 23:43.332
Okay. You know what?
I’m gonna call the city cops
and the mother.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.005
[Woman ]
First you’ll receive a complete
medical examination.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.299
Then we’ll test you
for foreign DNA

23:48.386 --> 23:50.798
Sweets, you had to hand her over
to properjurisdiction.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.888
It’s not a federal case.
That doesn’t make me
feel any better.

23:53.975 --> 23:58.218
I came to you for help.
I trusted you!

23:58.313 --> 24:01.350
- You promised.
— I’m sorry.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.323
What you did was
for her own good, Sweets.

24:09.407 --> 24:11.363
Come on. Let’s go home.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.406
Dr. Brennan told me to look for
any bone injuries that might’ve
taken place before he died.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.742
Now, I’ve compared the X—rays
to the bone injuries
five times now,

24:22.837 --> 24:24.793
and I noticed
that the fracturing
on the remains...

24:24.881 --> 24:27.588
is random and specific
at the same time.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.540
I don’t understand.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.001
Neither do I.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.507
If the bones were damaged
by being smashed
against the rocks,

24:33.598 --> 24:35.589
why do these injuries form
an inorganic pattern?

24:35.683 --> 24:39.892
Now, three lines—
one at the right scapula
continuing along T5 and 6,

24:39.979 --> 24:42.595
here, at the posterior extremity
of rib number 10,

24:42.690 --> 24:44.521
also favoring the right side,

24:44.609 --> 24:48.522
as well as here,
at the superior aspect
of the right iliac crest.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.649
And those in the center?

24:50.740 --> 24:52.446
Damage is postmortem
and seems to have occurred...

24:52.533 --> 24:54.273
after the victim was already
curled up in the suitcase.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.951
And one other thing.
Michelle’s in town visiting me.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.700
Excuse me?

24:59.791 --> 25:01.952
This has been weighing on me.
I can’t lie to you.

25:02.043 --> 25:05.877
You’re my boss.
And even if you weren’t,
I’m very bad at it.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.999
How long has she
been in town?

25:08.132 --> 25:12.000
Since yesterday.
I’d say you’re
a very good liar.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.336
She just wanted us
to have some time alone.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.512
She Ioves you,
but she thought
if you knew she was here—

25:16.599 --> 25:18.681
since you haven’t seen her
in such a long time—

25:18.768 --> 25:21.510
— And she’d be right.
You are in big trouble, Finn.
— Yes, ma’am, I know.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.890
With Michelle.
Why are you telling me this?

25:23.981 --> 25:25.437
Beg your pardon?

25:25.525 --> 25:28.608
If she finds out,
you’re a dead man.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.607
Not a good thing
to say here, I know.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.155
But... you owe her
your trust.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.575
I mean, I assume
that you didn’t tell her
you were gonna tell me.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.745
No, itjust came out.
I thought honesty
was the best policy.

25:40.832 --> 25:44.040
I’m mighty confused right now.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.915
Here’s what we’re gonna do.
You will meet with Michelle
and tell me where.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.586
I will happen upon you.

25:49.674 --> 25:52.131
That way you get to
save your relationship,

25:52.218 --> 25:54.049
I get to be angry
at my daughter,

25:54.137 --> 25:56.048
and she gets to think
it’s a coincidence.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.800
And everyone’s happy.
Understood?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.755
Uh—

25:59.851 --> 26:01.341
Yes, ma’am.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.927
And this... isn’t lying?

26:04.021 --> 26:06.683
Oh, Finn, you have
so much to learn.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.356
Why don’t you just concentrate
on the murder for now?

26:09.444 --> 26:12.436
Yes, ma’am.
I’d like that very much.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.783
I told Manny
to stay away from Kat.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.573
I thought they were
best friends.
Like family, you said.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.451
They weren’t little kids
having sleepovers anymore.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.249
I saw the way that Manny
was looking at her.

26:27.336 --> 26:31.249
Once those hormones get flowing—
I needed to protect her.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.296
He was gettin’ creepy.

26:33.384 --> 26:36.251
So you think that the boy
who grew up with your daughter
drugged and raped her?

26:36.345 --> 26:38.927
But you didn’t think
it was important enough
to do anything about?

26:39.015 --> 26:40.505
I did something.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.512
When Kat told me
what she thought happened,
I confronted Manny.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.890
— Okay. What did he say?
- Nothing.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.939
The blood drained from his face,
and he ran off.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.642
— What do you think that means?
— But you didn’t go to the cops?

26:52.737 --> 26:55.854
And say what? And say,
“My daughter thinks
she was raped,

26:55.948 --> 26:58.530
but she doesn’t know who did it
or when it happened”?

26:58.618 --> 27:01.030
Yes. And they examine her,
medically,

27:01.120 --> 27:04.453
so your daughter knows it’s true,
so she knows that someone cares.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.405
Weren’t you ever
in high school?

27:06.501 --> 27:12.041
Word of this gets out,
people call her a slut,
say she’s asking for it.

27:13.341 --> 27:14.956
I saw the pictures
from that party.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.258
l have a daughter, too,
and I would do anything
it took...

27:17.345 --> 27:19.176
to make sure she knew
that I would fight for her.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.764
Maybe she did fight,
Bones, you know?

27:20.848 --> 27:23.464
Maybe she got rid
of the boy she thought
raped her daughter...

27:23.559 --> 27:26.221
and then she told her daughter
not to say anything.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.474
I used to be married
to a cop.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.772
You want to charge me, fine.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.895
Otherwise we’re done here.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.988
I guess I can understand
a mother getting so mad...

27:43.079 --> 27:44.819
that she takes the law
into her own hands.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.745
And encouraging
her daughter to lie?

27:46.833 --> 27:49.620
Then the girl is involved
in another crime,
victimized twice.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.701
Did she look strong enough
to inflict these injuries?

27:51.796 --> 27:56.381
No. But the patterns indicate
some kind of localized force.

27:56.467 --> 27:57.968
Like a machine?

27:58.052 --> 28:00.634
Three sets of evenly spaced
linear breaks.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.507
And that’s just on the back.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.429
See here on the shins?

28:04.517 --> 28:07.680
Now, Dr. Hodgins found
three dents on the suitcase,
evenly spaced,

28:07.770 --> 28:09.761
that are different
from the dents
caused by the rocks.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.972
Is there any
particulate evidence
associated with them?

28:12.066 --> 28:13.977
Yeah, some fibers
that he’s running
through the mass spec.

28:14.068 --> 28:17.151
Good. Let’s see if Angela
can make any sense
of the patterns.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.070
I trusted you!

28:24.161 --> 28:27.289
Kat, I’m sorry.
You have to understand,
I had no choice.

28:27.415 --> 28:30.373
I had to report this.
I just want all this
to go away.

28:30.501 --> 28:33.368
Then why’d you tell me?
I don’t know.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.670
After talking to my mom,
I just got so confused.

28:36.757 --> 28:40.215

tell someone who would listen,
and you were right.

or it’ll stay with you forever.

Were you raped?

28:59.530 --> 29:02.317

29:06.120 --> 29:08.907
I was beaten.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.910

he did it for sport.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.742
I thought it was me,
you know?

29:14.837 --> 29:18.500
I thought... if I just—
if I behaved better—

29:18.591 --> 29:20.923
So that’s what
I tried to do.

29:21.010 --> 29:25.094
Until...
someone helped me see
it wasn’t my fault.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.842
It wasn’t.

or painful it is,

29:31.312 --> 29:34.349
it was— it was better
to face what happened.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.775

you weren’t allowed.

someone who can.

who got my foster dad arrested.

29:46.577 --> 29:49.569
But even the police say
there’s no evidence.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.372

I don’t believe that
Manny raped Kat.

31:42.777 --> 31:46.065
His behavior
at the party was protective,
and he had a crush on her.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.552
—[ Brennan] Manny’s watching.
- Manny’s not important right now.

32:19.688 --> 32:24.182
[ Brennan ] But he confronted them,
and Saunders threw Manny
out the front door.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.437
Okay, this is where we left
Manny the last time.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.144
This time let’s see
where Kat goes.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.981
Saunders rejects Kat,
dances with a new girl.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.817
Next, she left Saunders
and ran off crying.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.276
Maybe he followed her.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.579
I’ll go through the other photos
from the back of the house.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.790
[ Brennan] How about there?
[ Sweets ] She’s going
into the backyard.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.706
She’s upset.
She wants to be alone.

Someone is offering her
a drink.

[ Brennan ]
That’s not Manny.
He’s too big.

32:54.807 --> 32:56.468
[ Sweets ]
That’s got to be
the spiked drink.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.641
How long would it take
for a drug like that
to take effect?

32:58.727 --> 33:02.345
Depending on stomach contents,
between five and 15 minutes.

33:02.439 --> 33:05.602

on this photograph
is eight minutes later.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.111

She can barely walk.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.527

The drug has clearly
taken effect.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.651
That has to be
who raped her.

your promise, Sweets.

Please don’t
take it personally.

33:38.475 --> 33:42.639
I’d really like not to,
but you’re personally
avoiding me personally,

33:42.730 --> 33:45.062
so it’s very hard
not to take it personally.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.015
Why didn’t you
just tell me...

33:48.110 --> 33:49.850
you wanted to spend
the weekend in with Finn?

33:49.945 --> 33:52.402
Because I thought
it would hurt your feelings.

33:52.489 --> 33:55.447
Well, it would,
but I’d recover.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.070
You know I love you.

33:57.161 --> 33:59.823
I know you do.
That’s not the point.

33:59.914 --> 34:03.623
Loving someone does not
give you carte blanche
to treat them badly.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.325
Loving someone
is not an excuse.

34:08.923 --> 34:11.710
Okay. Now I’m
hiding the truth.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.301
What?

34:13.385 --> 34:16.718
Finn couldn’t
keep your secret.
He blurted it out.

outside the club—

No, Finn’s a good guy,
Michelle.

34:22.478 --> 34:24.890
I think we should both
just let him off the hook.

34:25.022 --> 34:28.389
By keeping ln/s a secret?
Oh, God. This is all
so confusing.

34:28.484 --> 34:31.647
Maybe we should just
tell each other everything
from now on.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.482
Okay. Yes.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.780
We really, really should.

I’m seeing someone.
Who?

34:42.456 --> 34:43.992
l’d rather not—

34:46.085 --> 34:47.996
He’s a poet.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.416
It’s Arastoo Vaziri.

34:51.507 --> 34:54.749
What, the intern
who works for you?

34:54.843 --> 34:56.344

He works with me
in that l administrate

Is there anything else
I should know?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.307
Wait. How did / get
on the defensive here?

35:09.191 --> 35:10.692
[Chuckling]

35:13.028 --> 35:16.316
Isuppose
you want me to keep ln/s
a secret from Finn?

35:16.407 --> 35:18.864
Oh, God. I didn’t
even think of that.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.942
Hmm. I’ll try.

35:22.997 --> 35:25.488
I saw where Finn found
the spider fracturing,

35:25.582 --> 35:28.244
so I swabbed the corresponding
damage to the suitcase...

35:28.335 --> 35:30.792
and I found some fibers
caught in the latch—

35:30.879 --> 35:33.666
a poly—fiber weave
used in strapping.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.418
Like webbing
or belting.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.841
The victim was crushed
with some kind of strap?

35:37.928 --> 35:41.011
Yeah. Something approximately
two inches in width.

35:41.098 --> 35:45.137
So if the victim
was placed into the suitcase
in the manner we thought—

35:45.269 --> 35:47.430
Like this.
Right— knees to chest.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.227
Like he was bowing
before the king.

35:49.315 --> 35:54.150
Three ratcheting straps
lined up with the patterns
Finn discovered.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.602
— Tighten.
- How much force
would be required?

35:56.697 --> 35:58.983
Well, the measurable unit
is called breakout strength.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.565
How much force the strap
can take before it snaps.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.651
So a ratcheting strap
such as this—

36:03.746 --> 36:06.408
the breakout strength
is roughly 500 pounds.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.454
Multiplied
by three straps.

36:08.542 --> 36:11.158
That should be
more than enough
to crush the resistance...

36:11.253 --> 36:14.086
from the ligaments
and intervertebral
fibrocartilage...

36:14.173 --> 36:16.004
and cause
the avulsion fractures.

36:16.091 --> 36:19.083
[Angela ] When the ligaments
at the fold points were
stretched beyond their limits,

36:19.178 --> 36:21.419
they ripped bone from bone.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.220
Pop,pop,pop.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.387
The kid fits
in the suitcase.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.641
One of the suspects works
for a moving company.

36:31.732 --> 36:35.270
I would find out
if he had access to
two—inch ratcheting straps.

You can’t come nose around

you could get away
with killing someone?

36:48.999 --> 36:51.331
Manny and me were friends.
You got the wrong guy.

36:51.418 --> 36:54.251
As the body was crushed
inside the suitcase,

36:54.338 --> 36:56.249
blood and tissue
would have spurted out.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.706
There should be residue
on the straps.

36:58.801 --> 37:02.259
Well, those straps are clean.
You can go ahead
and have a look.

37:02.346 --> 37:05.964

37:21.323 --> 37:24.565

a big misunderstanding,
a mistake.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.777
— So let’s just start
from the top, huh?
— Sure.

So, Manny comes over
to collect on some phones
that I sold.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.829
Only thing is,
the guy paid me
in Special “K.”

37:33.919 --> 37:36.456
So you were going
to pay Manny in ketamine?

37:36.547 --> 37:38.378
I mean,
I didn’t want the stuff,

37:38.507 --> 37:41.715
but the pills are worth three
times what the guy owed us,
and that’s all we were gonna get.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.760
I’m sorry. So paying Manny
in Special “K”— Was this
before or after the party?

37:44.847 --> 37:48.431
— After.
— Why didn’t you just give Manny
his payment at the party?

37:48.517 --> 37:51.099
Because you don’t
do something like that
in the open.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.768
Besides, Manny got into
some shouting match
over a girl,

37:53.856 --> 37:55.562
and the girl yelled at him,
and he left.

37:55.649 --> 37:58.561
— And she ran out back crying.
- I guess.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.267
Good thing you had
the Special “K” on you.

to drug Kat Martin

Manny heard about it
and figured it was you
because of the ketamine.

so he wouldn’t tell.

this is all his fault.

— Because you raped her.
— No, he was throwing things
at me. He was hitting me.

and I didn’t even hit him hard.
