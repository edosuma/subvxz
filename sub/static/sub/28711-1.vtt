Come on. Piece of shit.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.701
[beeps]

00:49.788 --> 00:52.313
Signal keeps getting dropped.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.707
[Eddie] I hate being this
far in at night.

00:55.794 --> 00:58.623
I'd be sweating too
if the law caught me
fishing with this.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.801
[signal beeping]

01:02.888 --> 01:04.194
-[Jones] Oh. I got it. Got it.
-[keyboard keys clacking]

01:04.281 --> 01:06.240
Looks like the last
drop zone is...

01:08.242 --> 01:09.895
Just beyond these trees.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.427
[signal beeps steadily]

01:19.514 --> 01:21.472
[beeping intensifies]

01:22.473 --> 01:23.735
Hey, hey, stop.

01:24.693 --> 01:25.955
I think we're here, boys.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.697
[Blaine]
Sure about this, Eddie?

01:28.784 --> 01:31.047
Man said bring out three boxes
and drop 'em,

01:31.134 --> 01:32.309
that's all I know.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.529
[Blaine] All right.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.854
[motor sputters and stops]

01:55.941 --> 01:57.073
What just happened?

01:57.856 --> 01:59.249
It won't start.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.644
[Blaine] What the hell
you mean it won't start?

02:03.427 --> 02:05.255
It won't start.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.561
[loud thud]

02:11.914 --> 02:14.134
That... that was just
a gator, right?

02:29.453 --> 02:30.454

[gasps]

02:37.592 --> 02:39.159
[muffled screaming]

02:43.511 --> 02:44.512
[Jones] Where'd he go?

02:47.732 --> 02:48.820
[gasping]

02:52.868 --> 02:54.130
-Come on!
-I got you. Just swim.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.523
-Please! Please! Please!
-[Jones] Come on!

02:55.610 --> 02:56.872
Just swim to me. Swim to me.

Come on, man!

03:03.226 --> 03:04.445
Just come here!

03:16.631 --> 03:17.588
[Eddie] What?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.721
Listen. Listen.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.177
[roots continue creaking]

05:49.958 --> 05:51.568
[Karen]  Who was trapped
in the castle?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.788
-[all]  Princess Cassie.
-[Karen]  Princess Cassie.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.311
And who was angry with her?

05:55.398 --> 05:57.095
[all] The Giant King.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.619
The Giant King.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.316
Now, why was
The Giant King angry, guys?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.057
[all] They stole all his gold.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.320
[Karen] Because they stole
all of his gold.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.888
But Princess Cassie
was in there by herself.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.716
-[coughing]
-So, do you think
she was happy?

06:08.803 --> 06:09.934
-[all] No.
-[Karen] Excited?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.458
[all] No.

06:11.545 --> 06:12.894
-[Karen] How did she feel?
-[all] Afraid.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.462
[Karen] She's scared...
She's very scared.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.725
When you're scared,
what are you supposed to do?

06:17.812 --> 06:19.640

06:57.895 --> 06:59.331
[man in English]
Stop! Put it down!

06:59.419 --> 07:00.768
Hey... Stop! Stop!

07:02.596 --> 07:04.815
[speaking French]

07:04.902 --> 07:07.818
[man in English] Hey, now.
I'm trying to help you.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.341
Put it down! Put it down.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.083
Doctor, hey, don't!

-[speaks French]

Don't take your mask off!

[in French]

08:19.411 --> 08:21.457
[helicopter hovering]

08:25.592 --> 08:28.638
Okay. Go ahead. Say it.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.771
What, that you were great?

08:32.076 --> 08:33.687
That you're a hero?

08:33.774 --> 08:36.472
Oh! I thought for sure
you were gonna tear into me

08:36.559 --> 08:39.127
for risking hemorrhagic fever
for that girl.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.520
It saved her life.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.481
Plus, I know you're
gonna beat yourself
up over that later,

08:45.568 --> 08:47.396
so just please...

08:47.483 --> 08:49.050
I'll go through all the tests.
Don't worry.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.095
Thank you.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.054
And we dropped
the last of the antibiotics
and the test kits

08:53.141 --> 08:55.535
in the village
in case the water
goes south again.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.711
What would I do
without you, Harlan?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.495
-Work on finding
us boyfriends?
-No.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.018
[laughs]

09:01.105 --> 09:02.846
Okay. Well, if you're
not gonna do that...

09:02.933 --> 09:04.892
Uh, Atlanta called earlier.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.894
There's a possible situation
brewing back in the States.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.199
Where?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.550
Ah...

09:16.686 --> 09:17.861
You're kidding.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.521
Well, it's not the Congo.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.870
You want to make a left there.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.004
You still remember.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.571
How long has it been
since you were home?

09:32.789 --> 09:34.269
A while.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.098
Well, somebody forgot
to tell beautiful Marais

09:37.185 --> 09:39.840
that 1962 was a long time ago.

09:59.903 --> 10:00.861
[muffled laughter]

10:10.914 --> 10:12.220
[Dr. Chowodury]
I'm glad the CDC is here

10:12.307 --> 10:15.223
'cause I'm running
out of options.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.051
So, it's still just
the three infected?

10:17.138 --> 10:18.705
Fourth came in this morning.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.707
Little girl presented first.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.623
She had direct contact
with her teacher and
the school nurse.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.276
-And today's patient?
-A clerk.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.930
From the Sunderland
One Stop on Guidry.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.324
Shit. It's spreading.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.368
Yeah.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.327
They all here?

10:32.414 --> 10:34.459
Yeah.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.679
[clears throat]
Okay, everyone.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.159
For those of you
who don't know,

10:38.246 --> 10:39.987
my name is Dr. Abby Arcane

10:40.074 --> 10:42.642
with the CDC's
Epidemic Intelligence Service.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.513
That is a real thing.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.733
Um, my team is here to assist
in caring for your patients

10:46.820 --> 10:49.257
and to find the source
of this disease.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.606
We need fresh blood samples,

10:50.693 --> 10:52.477
and diaries of each
patient's contacts

10:52.564 --> 10:54.610
before presenting symptoms.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.917
If we can identify
the disease, we can
figure out how to treat it.

10:57.004 --> 11:00.007
For now though, it is masks,
gloves and goggles

11:00.094 --> 11:03.097
for anyone in direct contact
with the patients.

11:03.184 --> 11:06.970
Caregivers do not get sick
on my watch, okay?

11:07.057 --> 11:08.102
Let's get to it.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.597
-[Abby] Hey, sweetie.
-[inhales sharply]

11:25.685 --> 11:27.034
How you feelin'?

11:48.272 --> 11:49.709
So I found this on her pillow.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.234
Maybe transfer from
the ambulance?

11:53.321 --> 11:55.236
I don't think so.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.412
Has she been
breathing like this
since she was admitted?

11:57.499 --> 12:00.371
Our X-rays did find
a stubborn mycosis
in her lungs,

12:00.458 --> 12:03.157
but it's not fungal.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.898
I'll have the staff
check for contamination.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.000
Excuse me?

12:20.087 --> 12:22.567
-You can't take those.
-I'm not.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.613
-You're not what?
-Taking them.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.833
I'm just looking as
an interested party.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.748
These blood tests,
are they the most recent?

12:29.357 --> 12:31.185
Okay.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.100
If you can give me the tests
from when she first came in,

12:33.187 --> 12:35.015
I can compare them
with the latest results.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.451
Who are you exactly?

12:36.538 --> 12:37.887
I told you before,
this area is off limits.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.759
-Fuck, again.
-I'm sorry, Dr. Arcane.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.804
Listen, you're not gonna find
anything you need

12:41.891 --> 12:43.023
in the standard CDC rule book.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.894
-I promise.
-Excuse me.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.330
-Get security!
-No, no, no. It's fine.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.636
-It's fine. It's fine.
-Let's go.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.116
I'm out. I'm gone. I'm out.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.987
You're gonna wanna speak
to me sooner or later.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.163
Hey, can we just be friends?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.904
-See you tomorrow, Bob.
-[door opens]

12:54.991 --> 12:56.776
Who the hell was that?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.865
No idea.
We should find out though.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.868
-Uh, where are we
on Susie's parents?
-Mother's dead.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.044
Her father Eddie's MIA.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.568
Cops say his boat's not
in his slip, so he could
be out in the water.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.048
[Abby] Mmm.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.224
And the school bus
picked her up as usual.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.921
So maybe Dad made it home.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.491
[crows cawing]

13:29.634 --> 13:31.636
[vehicle approaching]

13:38.556 --> 13:40.297
-Matt?
-Dispatch said

13:40.384 --> 13:42.430
a Dr. Arcane
requested assistance.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.998
I said that
was fucking impossible.

13:45.085 --> 13:48.523
-You're a cop now.
-Yeah, four years.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.178
Jesus Christ, Abby.
Didn't think we'd
ever see you again.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.962
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.660
Yeah.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.185
-The Coyle girl.
How's she doing?
-Not good.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.317
And right now,
she's patient zero.

14:00.404 --> 14:01.884
What do you know
about her dad?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.103
-Who, Eddie?
-Yeah.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.844
He's a fisherman, mostly.

14:04.931 --> 14:08.064
Pulled him in a few times
for game violations, a DUI...

14:08.151 --> 14:09.631
[Abby] Child Services?

14:09.718 --> 14:11.459
[Matt]
Never had any complaints.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.765
Well, around here,
that makes you
father of the year.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.724
[Matt chuckles]

14:15.811 --> 14:18.074
When the little girl
got sick, we called,
but no answer.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.597
And since Eddie's boat
was still out,

14:19.684 --> 14:22.078
we didn't think
anything of it.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.863
[door creaks]

14:35.831 --> 14:37.006
Mr. Coyle?

14:39.748 --> 14:40.749
Coyle!

15:35.325 --> 15:36.544

15:46.032 --> 15:48.556

-Yeah, I hear it.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.348
Mr. Coyle?

16:44.046 --> 16:45.091
Mr. Coyle?

16:47.702 --> 16:48.703

[door creaking]

17:05.372 --> 17:07.330

17:11.682 --> 17:12.683
Hey.

17:17.079 --> 17:17.993
Hey.

17:19.647 --> 17:20.865
-Hey!
-[shrieks]

17:23.085 --> 17:25.000
-Fuck!
-Drop it, right now!

17:25.087 --> 17:26.610
-What?
-I said drop it!

17:26.697 --> 17:28.569
Wait, hold up...

17:28.656 --> 17:29.787
-Drop it!
-I'm collecting a sample!
I'm collecting a sample!

17:31.528 --> 17:33.617
What the hell are
you doing here?

17:33.704 --> 17:35.924
-You know this guy?
-Yeah. He was at
the hospital earlier,

17:36.011 --> 17:37.273
-trespassing.
-Guys. Guys!

17:37.360 --> 17:39.449
[panting]

17:40.929 --> 17:42.496
You're focusing on
the wrong thing here.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.008
[Matt] What the fuck?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.260
-[cracks]
-[gasps]

18:56.613 --> 18:57.919
[Matt] His name's Alec Holland.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.355
Seen him around
the past few months.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.009
Kind of, I don't know,
scientist-type.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.271
-[Abby] Seriously?
-What?

19:04.012 --> 19:05.666
You're not arresting him,
are you?

19:05.753 --> 19:07.624
He did break in.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.757
Well, what happened
with Eddie Coyle
wasn't because of him.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.020
So what the hell did this?

19:14.022 --> 19:15.197
It's what I intend to find out.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.069
That's enough. No more.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.158
Hey.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.165
Excuse me, uh...

19:26.252 --> 19:27.992
[clears throat] Dr. Arcane,
can I talk to you for... Again?

19:28.079 --> 19:31.344
-What is up with you?
-What?

19:31.431 --> 19:33.911
-You're clearly not a local.
-No, I, uh...

19:33.998 --> 19:35.348
I'm just trying to help.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.871
By being everywhere
you shouldn't be?

19:36.958 --> 19:39.569
Listen, um, you saw the body.

19:39.656 --> 19:40.875
Dealt with anything
like that before?

19:40.962 --> 19:42.659
We have it under control.
It's okay.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.139
Well, nothing's working,
is it?

19:44.226 --> 19:45.662
Pyrazinamide? Ethambutol?

19:47.534 --> 19:48.970
Who are you again?

19:49.057 --> 19:50.667
Holland, like, the country.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.105
Listen. Listen, listen, listen.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.326
Avery Sunderland
hired me to collect
and analyze biological--

19:57.413 --> 19:59.546
Congratulations. He's a very
important man around here.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.243
Thank you very much.
The thing is,

20:01.330 --> 20:03.941
is that I've been finding
some serious fucking crazy.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.508
-Crazy?
-Yes, as in,

20:05.595 --> 20:07.684
biological processes
I've never seen before,

20:07.771 --> 20:09.991
and I think that they could be
connected to your infection.

20:10.818 --> 20:11.819
How?

20:12.559 --> 20:14.125
[sighs]

20:14.213 --> 20:15.736
It's easier to show you
than to tell you.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.694
Sunderland's lab's on
the water, 20 minutes out.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.609
-I have patients waiting.
-Yes. Yes.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.133
I know they're waiting.
They're waiting for a cure,

20:22.221 --> 20:25.093
but I'm guessing the doctors
haven't had any luck ID'ing
the pathogen yet.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.530
No.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.231
You like mysteries?

20:32.318 --> 20:34.755
You know, old mystery,
like  Murder She Wrote,
Columbo...

20:36.104 --> 20:38.367
-[laughs] What?
-What?

20:38.454 --> 20:41.327
Wow. I like references
that aren't from the 1980s...

20:41.414 --> 20:43.372
It was the first thing
that popped in mind.
It doesn't have to--

20:43.459 --> 20:45.200
-Well, no. I don't
like mysteries...
-Okay.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.810
-I like solutions.
-Me, too.

20:46.897 --> 20:49.291
So let me help you
find one, okay?

20:49.378 --> 20:50.858
Okay? Going back
to the hospital,

20:50.945 --> 20:52.381
spinning around,
trying to find an answer...

20:52.468 --> 20:53.600
It's not gonna get you
any closer to the truth.

20:55.036 --> 20:55.993
Going out there,

20:57.125 --> 20:58.082
that will.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.047
That worked, yeah.
That worked. Here we go.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.757
[flapping]

21:22.759 --> 21:24.326
How'd you know
I wasn't a local?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.548
You're wearing
designer flip-flops.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.639
Comfy suckers, though.

21:33.944 --> 21:34.989
And the attitude.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.687
It's a bit of a giveaway, too.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.319
[Alec] Watch your step.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.277
It's tight.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.496
-[dog barking]
-Where is he?

22:03.583 --> 22:05.889
Oh! What were you doing?

22:05.976 --> 22:07.326
What were you doing?

22:09.371 --> 22:10.590
It's a little steep,
be careful.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.202
[Abby] Aw!

22:14.289 --> 22:16.117
This is my, uh, buddy, Garou.

22:18.815 --> 22:19.773
[door closes]

22:27.868 --> 22:29.957
What kind of study is this?

22:30.044 --> 22:32.960
The kind dip-shit biologists
like me dream about.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.048
Check this out.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.054
All right, um...

22:40.141 --> 22:42.230
How much do you know
about mutagens?

22:42.317 --> 22:45.929
The stuff that causes
cancer, that blows
holes in human DNA...

22:46.016 --> 22:48.105
Right. The ones we know about.

22:48.192 --> 22:49.368
-Uh-huh.
-Right?

22:51.848 --> 22:53.067
[beeping]

22:53.154 --> 22:54.547
[device whirring]

22:56.592 --> 23:00.248
I'm close to identifying
an entirely new strand

23:00.335 --> 23:01.597
buried deep in this swamp.

23:03.207 --> 23:04.470
All right, here we go.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.646
So, um, for the last
seven months,

23:06.733 --> 23:08.561
I've been out on the water

23:08.648 --> 23:10.954
mapping out
biological hotspots

23:11.041 --> 23:12.782
where the mutagenic activity
is the strongest,

23:12.869 --> 23:15.437
and the thing is, is that
for the last two weeks,

23:15.524 --> 23:20.094
I've noticed a steady increase
in speed of these processes.

23:20.181 --> 23:23.140
-[beeps]
-And this...

23:25.012 --> 23:28.189
is a sample I took
just yesterday, um,

23:28.276 --> 23:30.017
at one of the most
active sites.

23:30.104 --> 23:33.412
This clear shit on top,
that's just swamp water, right?

23:33.499 --> 23:34.978
But right there on the bottom,
you see that?

23:35.065 --> 23:36.327
I do.

23:37.677 --> 23:38.982
That doesn't belong.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.031
[Alec] Green Spanish moss.

23:44.118 --> 23:45.293
[Abby] Plant-based
growth medium.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.252
I've taken a few classes.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.739
-You ready?
-Mmm-hmm.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.144
[rustling]

24:15.932 --> 24:17.064
[crackles]

24:19.370 --> 24:20.371
Oh, my God.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.159
-[glass crackling]
-Holland!

24:25.246 --> 24:26.595
-[gasps]
-[steam hisses]

24:30.207 --> 24:31.818
-What just happened?
-Fuck.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.474
I don't know, um...

24:37.911 --> 24:38.868
[keys clacking]

24:43.786 --> 24:45.832
I think the stuff at
the bottom of the tube,
I don't... I...

24:45.919 --> 24:48.138
It's gotta be some sort
of biological accelerant
or something.

24:48.225 --> 24:49.400
-Like a fertilizer.
-Yeah.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.141
But it only jacks up mutagens.

24:52.969 --> 24:53.840
What?

24:55.668 --> 24:57.408
What?

24:57.496 --> 24:59.280
You wanted to test
Susie Coyle's blood
from two days ago

24:59.367 --> 25:01.064
against today's to see
if it had changed.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.110
Yes.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.025
This really could be
what's making people sick.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.462
It's like  Columbo.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.426
[cell phone buzzing]

25:15.514 --> 25:17.733
All right, Coyle's body
is ready for postmortem.

25:17.820 --> 25:22.782
Tell me, please,
that you have all this
science fiction backed up.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.001
-A hard-drive away.
-Okay.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.916
-Can you get me
to the hospital?
-Okay.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.615
Might not let me in, but...

25:29.702 --> 25:31.660
[indistinct chattering]

25:34.881 --> 25:36.317
-[Riley]  People.
-[indistinct chatter]

25:36.404 --> 25:38.580
Settle down, people.
Settle down.

25:38.667 --> 25:42.149
I know this bug
has got everyone rattled,

25:42.236 --> 25:44.804
but the doctors are doing
everything they can.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.501
[man 1] Big timber's coming in,

25:46.588 --> 25:49.417
dumping their trash,
burning trees...

25:49.504 --> 25:51.332
The swamp puts food
on our tables.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.899
We lose that,
we lose everything!

25:52.986 --> 25:54.030
[indistinct shouting]

25:54.117 --> 25:55.597
Just say it, Riley!

25:55.684 --> 25:58.034
The swamp's had enough.
This is payback.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.558
[woman] Yeah!

25:59.645 --> 26:01.690
[Riley] We... We don't know
what this is yet.

26:01.777 --> 26:05.433
The hospital is on it 24/7,
and the CDC.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.566
[man 2] Bullshit.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.959
[Avery] Hold on! Hold on!

26:11.613 --> 26:13.093
I'm not saying you're wrong,

26:13.180 --> 26:15.008
but right now,
let the doctors do their work.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.619
Hell, Avery, I don't got
money for doctors.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.273
[indistinct chatter]

26:20.709 --> 26:22.929
It comes to that, you see me.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.061
Goes for all of you.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.977
You know that.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.675
Maybe you ought to put some
of that Sunderland money
into this town,

26:29.762 --> 26:32.068
and less in that
nonsense lab of yours.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.331
[all clamoring]

26:41.208 --> 26:44.167
You know, the swamp
took my father from me

26:44.254 --> 26:47.344
when I was still a boy.
You know that, right?

26:47.431 --> 26:50.130
But ever since, that same swamp

26:50.217 --> 26:54.917
has given me, you,
and this whole damn town

26:55.004 --> 26:56.353
a way of life.

26:58.921 --> 27:01.620
Yeah, there's something special
about this place,

27:01.707 --> 27:03.926
you know that,
we all know that.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.668
And you live here long enough,
you feel it

27:06.755 --> 27:08.061
in your bones.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.367
Now, my research

27:11.412 --> 27:13.109
is about the future,

27:13.196 --> 27:15.721
uncovering what else
the swamp can offer.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.724
New medicines, fertilizers,
God knows what else.

27:18.811 --> 27:22.858
And if what we find is worth
what I hope it is,

27:22.945 --> 27:25.426
that could be the answer
to this town's troubles.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.254
Your troubles, more like it.

27:27.341 --> 27:29.648
A rising tide lifts
all boats, Leon,

27:29.735 --> 27:31.345
even that shit box of yours.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.781
[crowd laughs]

27:34.261 --> 27:36.655
Hell, yeah, I took a hit
and we all did.

27:36.742 --> 27:37.873
[all] Yeah.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.705
I could have pulled up stakes

27:43.792 --> 27:45.707
and left Marais high and dry.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.318
But Marais is home.

27:51.495 --> 27:52.801
Where my daddy is buried.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.327
And my little girl.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.981
Where I met Maria.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.421
Now, if I was like most of you

28:04.508 --> 28:07.163
and 20 years younger,
I'd get my ass back to work.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.165
[crowd laughs]

28:09.252 --> 28:11.559
[laughs] All right,
folks, listen.

28:11.646 --> 28:15.345
We'll, uh, post updates
as we get 'em. Thank you.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.130
[indistinct chattering]

28:23.484 --> 28:24.615
[Alec] Excuse me.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.616
[Avery] Of course.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.315
That was a nice speech.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.273
What are you doing here,
Holland?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.145
Did you get 'em?
Did you get the findings
I sent you last night?

28:32.232 --> 28:33.537
I did, and I was wondering why,

28:33.624 --> 28:35.714
since I dismissed you
two weeks ago.

28:35.801 --> 28:38.151
Is that what that was?

28:38.238 --> 28:40.588
Well, I assumed you'd
reconsider since things
were just getting interesting.

28:40.675 --> 28:41.545
[Avery sighs]

28:41.632 --> 28:44.070
Say what you came to say.

28:44.157 --> 28:47.160
For the last two weeks,
the evolutionary cycle
of the mutagen

28:47.247 --> 28:49.336
has just continued
to skyrocket

28:49.423 --> 28:52.948
and now out of nowhere,
people are just getting sick?

28:53.035 --> 28:54.863
And you think
there's a connection?

28:54.950 --> 28:57.083
Yeah, I mean, yeah.
I mean, I can't rule
it out. Yes.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.738
You don't need to set your hair
on fire either, Holland.

28:59.825 --> 29:01.261
I'm not a scientist,

29:01.348 --> 29:03.872
but disease is not uncommon
around Marais.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.005
We had an epidemic in '86,

29:06.092 --> 29:07.920
and one in '92.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.096
People get sick.
They always have.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.794
Yeah, sure. That makes sense.

29:12.881 --> 29:15.014
-But you're not convinced.
-No, I'm not, Avery.

29:15.101 --> 29:18.757
You, uh... You hired me
to follow the science
and here I am.

29:18.844 --> 29:21.237
I also hired a man
looking for a second chance.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.892
This town doesn't need a panic.

29:23.979 --> 29:26.852
It doesn't need an epidemic
either, Avery.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.202
[Maria] Honey,
Mr. Adams would like a word.

29:29.289 --> 29:30.551
Oh, boy. Aye-aye!

29:30.638 --> 29:32.727
Go home, Holland.
We got it from here.

29:32.814 --> 29:33.989
Okay.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.226
[door closes]

29:55.706 --> 29:57.447
-[Alec] Hey.
-Hey.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.016
Okay.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.980
Do you ever sleep, Dr. Arcane?

30:08.067 --> 30:09.372
Not when everyone else does.

30:09.459 --> 30:10.896
And it's Abby.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.511
Have you ever seen an autopsy?

30:18.773 --> 30:19.861
Yeah, yeah.

30:19.948 --> 30:22.429
Saw an alien autopsy once.

30:22.516 --> 30:23.865
I'm pretty sure
it was fake though.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.042
All right.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.088
I'm, uh, gonna set up
the test gear.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.568
You kids have fun.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.230
How's the girl?

30:41.317 --> 30:44.625
The drug therapy is slowing
the beast in the adults, but...

30:44.712 --> 30:48.020
Susie had gone for two days
before we got to her, so...

30:48.107 --> 30:49.630
She's also only nine years old.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.241
It's not your fault.

31:03.470 --> 31:06.908
A plant sample,
straight from the source.
Knock yourself out.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.214
Thank you.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.404
[clears throat]

31:30.105 --> 31:31.367
Got a reaction here.

31:48.428 --> 31:51.387
[monitor beeping]

31:51.474 --> 31:53.650
-[gasps]
-[beeping intensifies]

32:07.403 --> 32:08.578
[growls]

32:08.665 --> 32:10.276
[screaming]

32:11.538 --> 32:12.974
[metal clanking]

32:14.497 --> 32:15.803
We gotta go. We gotta go.

32:15.890 --> 32:17.022
[Abby screams]

32:17.109 --> 32:18.371
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.549
[machine beeping]

32:23.680 --> 32:24.768
[Abby] Oh, my God!

32:25.334 --> 32:26.945
Alec!

32:27.032 --> 32:29.077
[machine beeping rapidly]

32:36.737 --> 32:37.999
[electricity crackling]

32:40.915 --> 32:42.830
Fuck!

32:42.917 --> 32:44.701
[Alec] Come on!
Come on! Come on!

32:44.788 --> 32:46.138
[Abby and Alec scream]

32:48.575 --> 32:49.706
[screaming]

33:02.981 --> 33:05.244
[shrieking]

33:05.331 --> 33:06.810
[gasps] Susie.

33:08.247 --> 33:09.552
Daddy!

33:14.427 --> 33:16.820
Abby! Abby, wait!

33:16.907 --> 33:18.257
[electricity crackling]

33:19.388 --> 33:20.607
Go, go, go, go!

33:22.696 --> 33:24.002
Susie. Susie.

33:29.572 --> 33:30.486
[gasps]

33:32.227 --> 33:33.837
[objects clattering]

33:45.153 --> 33:47.373
[snarling and chittering]

34:03.215 --> 34:05.043
Clear! Clear! Clear!

34:05.130 --> 34:06.044
She's Code Blue.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.766
[breathing heavily]

34:32.853 --> 34:34.072
Come on, honey.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.336
Come on.

34:41.688 --> 34:42.906
[gasps]

34:43.907 --> 34:44.908
Susie.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.959
Okay, I'm getting something.
Restart the IV.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.925
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:16.853 --> 35:18.028
[sighs]

35:23.077 --> 35:24.034
You all right?

35:33.827 --> 35:35.045
The, uh...

35:46.622 --> 35:48.102
It's a piece of glass.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.063
[sighs]

35:55.457 --> 35:56.850
So what now?

35:59.200 --> 36:00.723
We can't just sit here.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.464
[cell phone buzzing]

36:06.512 --> 36:07.600
I'm gonna go check
something out.

36:08.775 --> 36:09.993
You coming?

36:11.212 --> 36:12.909
Does it involve bourbon?

36:14.084 --> 36:15.956
Actually, yes.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.871
[country music playing
on speakers]

36:17.958 --> 36:19.916
[excited chattering]

36:34.627 --> 36:35.889
[Alec] What?

36:38.500 --> 36:41.286
I was just kidding
about the, uh, bourbon.

36:41.373 --> 36:44.114
A friend of mine's inside.
She's a reporter.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.508
Maybe she knows why
Eddie was out in that water.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.254
[Alec] This is where
you used to hang out, huh?

36:53.341 --> 36:56.301
[Abby] This is where
everybody in Marais hangs out.

36:58.781 --> 37:00.522
Scary woman, 12 o'clock.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.223
Xanadu.

37:06.354 --> 37:07.877
Can't believe she's still here.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.489
[indistinct chatter]

37:20.977 --> 37:22.327
Abby Arcane.

37:22.414 --> 37:23.763
Goddamn!

37:23.850 --> 37:25.460
[chuckles]

37:25.547 --> 37:27.157
-I heard you were back in town.
-[both chuckle]

37:27.245 --> 37:29.812
Liz.

37:29.899 --> 37:32.162
Delroy's on a supply run,
but I know he'd wanna see you.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.122
Uh, yeah, I'd love to
see your dad, but it's, uh...

37:35.209 --> 37:36.428
It's not that kind of visit.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.692
Right.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.389
Guess it'd take nothing less
than a medical meltdown

37:41.476 --> 37:42.521
to bring you back to Marais.

37:43.739 --> 37:44.871
Uh, Alec Holland,

37:44.958 --> 37:46.176
-this is Liz Tremayne.
-Hi.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.310
I...

37:49.397 --> 37:51.181
Yeah, you guys catch up,
I'll get the drink.

37:53.532 --> 37:54.576
What's with sandals?

37:56.926 --> 37:57.971
He's all right.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.717
So...

38:04.804 --> 38:06.588
Heard you found something
seriously messed up

38:06.675 --> 38:07.807
over at Eddie Coyle's.

38:09.025 --> 38:10.113
Who said that?

38:11.027 --> 38:12.638
It's out there, Abby.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.596
[scoffs] This town...

38:16.119 --> 38:17.730
You still work
for the  Echo, right?

38:20.428 --> 38:21.864
I need a favor.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.605
[chuckles softly]

38:23.692 --> 38:25.303
I gotta write the Coyle story
before I can hold it.

38:25.390 --> 38:28.654
I'm not saying that,
I just, um...

38:28.741 --> 38:31.352
Have you seen anything unusual
at the docks lately?

38:33.702 --> 38:35.008
Wait, you're Abby's reporter?

38:35.095 --> 38:37.184
For the  Marais Echo Weekly.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.925
-[Alec] Hmm.
-Emphasis on the weekly.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.970
So I have time to help out
my dad when I can.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.409
-No offense.
-Some taken.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.416
Not a lot of people
are talking, Abby.

38:51.503 --> 38:52.982
So you already know it's bad.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.462
Why do you say that?

38:54.549 --> 38:57.596
'Cause it's Marais.
Mosquitoes and gossip...

38:57.683 --> 38:59.598
Two things we get
a lot of here.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.035
But...

39:03.819 --> 39:05.778
I have heard whispers
of someone hiring boats

39:05.865 --> 39:07.780
to go out into
the swamp at night.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.304
Who?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.654
No one knows.
The who or the why.

39:12.741 --> 39:15.614
-And Eddie Coyle?
-His boat was never found.

39:15.701 --> 39:18.965
And the guy he crewed with,
he's AWOL, too.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.270
Last thing anyone heard,

39:20.358 --> 39:21.576
they were headed out
to Skeeter Cove.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.190
Oh, shit.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.105
Abby...

39:32.848 --> 39:35.198
No. Sit.

39:35.285 --> 39:36.722
Could you give us
a moment, please?

39:50.910 --> 39:53.782
[inaudible]

39:53.869 --> 39:56.959
-[Liz] Can I get you anything?
-[Maria] No, thanks.

40:00.963 --> 40:04.750
Five thousand people
work at the CDC.
I looked it up.

40:04.837 --> 40:11.321
That's 4,999 other options
they could have sent.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.541
I'm good at my job.
They knew I could help.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.109
I wanted to help.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.546
Where did you end up studying?

40:20.461 --> 40:21.506
Emory.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.772
Okay. So, let's think about
this just for a minute.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.733
Your freshman year...

40:31.820 --> 40:33.605
When you were
going out to parties...

40:33.692 --> 40:38.000
-I didn't--
-When you were
going out to parties...

40:39.828 --> 40:42.788
I spent your freshman year
in Shawna's bedroom.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.267
Mrs. Sunderland...

40:46.052 --> 40:48.837
I think about Shawna
every day.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.491
I'm speaking now.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.322
Sophomore year...

40:59.021 --> 41:02.198
Maybe that's just about
the time you figured out

41:02.285 --> 41:04.374
what you wanted to do in life,

41:04.462 --> 41:06.028
and declared a major.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.728
That's about the time I...

41:09.815 --> 41:12.382
stumbled out of her bed
and into a bottle.

41:14.254 --> 41:15.473
A lot of bottles.

41:20.216 --> 41:25.004
Now, what I'm really
trying to forget

41:26.048 --> 41:28.964
is your senior year.

41:29.051 --> 41:33.491
Because while you were
applying to medical schools,

41:33.578 --> 41:36.145
my husband was
talking to divorce lawyers.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.584
It was the thought
of losing him

41:39.671 --> 41:41.542
that finally made me
quit drinking.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.676
And I asked Avery

41:46.460 --> 41:48.984
where that kind of strength
came from.

41:51.334 --> 41:52.510
And he said,

41:54.033 --> 41:55.338
because...

41:56.775 --> 42:00.387
all that darkness
wasn't my fault.

42:02.607 --> 42:03.912
It was yours.

42:06.915 --> 42:09.701
You said you're good
at what you do

42:09.788 --> 42:13.618
and that you can help,
that's why you came here.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.707
And that's why
I'm letting you stay.

42:18.492 --> 42:19.841
But if that little girl dies--

42:19.928 --> 42:21.147
She won't.

42:22.148 --> 42:23.105
Promise me.

42:24.019 --> 42:25.107
[scoffs]

42:26.108 --> 42:28.894
Go ahead. Promise.

42:28.981 --> 42:30.156
[exhales sharply]

42:33.725 --> 42:35.335
[sniffles]

42:35.422 --> 42:36.728
I promise.

42:37.293 --> 42:38.381
Hmm.

42:41.733 --> 42:44.344
Within the minute she's better,

42:47.608 --> 42:49.088
I want you gone.

42:56.312 --> 42:57.531
[exhales]

43:05.495 --> 43:06.584
[sniffles]

43:15.897 --> 43:17.856
We... We should go
check out Skeeter Cove.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.727
Okay.

43:23.862 --> 43:25.254
[thunder crashes]

43:28.475 --> 43:29.868
[thunder rumbling]

43:36.309 --> 43:37.484
[Abby] Oh, my God.

43:43.403 --> 43:44.578
[Alec] What the hell?

43:45.753 --> 43:47.799
How is that even possible?

43:49.061 --> 43:50.845
[Alec] I have no idea.

44:08.384 --> 44:09.734
[thunder rumbling]

44:11.300 --> 44:12.519
[Alec] Found something.

44:21.049 --> 44:22.616
Laptop.

44:22.703 --> 44:23.704
[Alec] That could help.

44:25.271 --> 44:26.664
Here, hold this.

44:42.201 --> 44:43.245
What is it?

44:52.211 --> 44:53.691
[rattling]

45:10.229 --> 45:11.621
[thunder rumbling]

45:26.941 --> 45:28.638
[Alec] It's like a...

45:28.726 --> 45:31.293
Underwater release
mechanism or something.

45:31.380 --> 45:32.599
Releasing what?

45:33.600 --> 45:34.906
I don't know.

45:34.993 --> 45:36.603
Let's take it back to the lab.

45:40.215 --> 45:41.608
[thunder rumbling]

45:51.139 --> 45:52.532
[thunder rumbling]

45:59.974 --> 46:02.063
-[keyboard clacking]
-Let's see what you are.

46:03.238 --> 46:05.588
-[switch clicks]
-[beeps]

46:05.675 --> 46:07.939
It's almost worth coming back
just for him.

46:15.642 --> 46:16.599
What are you doing,
buggin' her?

46:16.686 --> 46:17.862
Come here. [clicks tongue]

46:19.254 --> 46:20.429
Go downstairs.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.998
[sighs]

46:24.085 --> 46:25.695
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

46:26.609 --> 46:28.611
And now, we wait. [sighs]

46:31.179 --> 46:32.964
So, is, uh, Mrs. Sunderland
the reason

46:33.051 --> 46:34.182
you don't visit home much?

46:35.401 --> 46:37.316
Uh...

46:37.403 --> 46:40.014
She'd say I'm the reason
I don't come home much.

46:40.101 --> 46:41.059
And she's right.

46:43.322 --> 46:44.802
Do you ever feel like that?

46:46.499 --> 46:47.848
That's why I'm here.

46:49.763 --> 46:51.373
One thing we have in common.

46:52.200 --> 46:53.245
[Alec scoffs]

46:55.856 --> 46:57.727
May I offer you a drink?

46:57.815 --> 46:59.773
I sure as hell could use one.

46:59.860 --> 47:01.819
That's two things
we have in common.

47:01.906 --> 47:03.777
Okay.

47:03.864 --> 47:05.910
[grunts] Let's see.

47:08.390 --> 47:10.479
Hmm...

47:10.566 --> 47:12.917
-Glasses...
-It's... It's okay.

47:13.004 --> 47:14.135
Okay.

47:15.702 --> 47:16.877
Here you go.

47:17.573 --> 47:19.488
[both sigh]

47:23.971 --> 47:25.277
I...

47:26.278 --> 47:28.410
have a confession.

47:28.497 --> 47:30.630
You're the president
of the  Columbo fan page.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.719
[laughs]

47:35.113 --> 47:37.289
No. No, I...

47:38.029 --> 47:39.247
I Googled you.

47:40.901 --> 47:42.076
Oh.

47:44.122 --> 47:45.079
When?

47:46.124 --> 47:47.299
Earlier today.

47:55.133 --> 47:59.006
Yeah. Yeah, it's funny
you think I haven't seen those.

47:59.093 --> 48:00.703
-I'm sorry.
-No. No. It's fine.

48:00.790 --> 48:02.357
[clears throat]

48:02.444 --> 48:03.750
So, it's true?

48:04.620 --> 48:05.839
What?

48:07.449 --> 48:09.060
That I, uh,

48:09.147 --> 48:11.714
manipulated the data
to better prove my conclusion?

48:13.281 --> 48:14.848
Yeah. Yeah.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.678
I still stand by what I found.

48:20.245 --> 48:22.290
But you couldn't
replicate the results.

48:24.336 --> 48:25.554
Not yet.

48:27.382 --> 48:28.949
Okay. So, why do it then?

48:29.776 --> 48:30.820
Why do it then?

48:30.908 --> 48:32.300
Yeah, um... Can I have that?

48:34.650 --> 48:36.522
I don't know.
No, I know. Um...

48:39.568 --> 48:41.353
I always wanted to be
known by my work,

48:41.440 --> 48:45.009
you know, I wanted the work
to define me and, uh...

48:46.836 --> 48:49.404
Well, now it does,
just not in the way I wanted.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.191
So, how did all that
land you here?

48:53.278 --> 48:54.366
Oh, in this palace?

48:54.453 --> 48:56.629
-[chuckles]
-Uh...

48:56.716 --> 48:58.936
Well, when the smoke cleared,
I realized pretty quickly

48:59.023 --> 49:01.373
that I was chasing after
the wrong things, you know.

49:03.505 --> 49:05.768
I don't...

49:05.855 --> 49:07.509
need to be published
in the big journals

49:07.596 --> 49:08.946
or, uh, [clears throat]

49:09.033 --> 49:11.035
taught in high school
biology classes,

49:11.122 --> 49:12.819
although that would
be pretty cool, but...

49:13.515 --> 49:15.691
No. Uh...

49:15.778 --> 49:18.042
The joy's always been
in the discovery.

49:18.825 --> 49:21.001
So...

49:21.088 --> 49:23.917
Guess sometimes the mistakes
we make stay with us.

49:24.744 --> 49:26.224
What I wouldn't give

49:26.311 --> 49:28.443
for you to Google my name
and it'd just say...

49:28.530 --> 49:31.011
"Sorry, your query
got back no results."

49:31.098 --> 49:32.273
Hmm.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.796
Well, look at that,

49:33.883 --> 49:35.233
it's three things
we have in common.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.322
Oh.

49:37.409 --> 49:39.367
What? What do you mean?

49:39.454 --> 49:41.152
Speaking of
Avery Sunderland...

49:43.197 --> 49:45.156
[sighs] Um...

49:46.722 --> 49:49.508
He and his wife
had a daughter...

49:52.424 --> 49:53.381
Shawna.

49:54.643 --> 49:55.862
And, um...

49:57.472 --> 50:00.127
Growing up, we were...
We were best friends.

50:00.214 --> 50:03.957
She was like my sister.
The Sunderlands were...

50:04.044 --> 50:05.872
They were, uh... [chuckles]

50:08.135 --> 50:09.745
They were like parents to me.

50:12.052 --> 50:15.316
And two days
before we graduated,

50:15.882 --> 50:16.883
I, um...

50:16.970 --> 50:17.971
[beeps]

50:19.233 --> 50:20.626
[whirring]

50:21.670 --> 50:22.715
[beeps]

50:22.802 --> 50:25.370
Right. Let's grab that.

50:25.457 --> 50:27.807
No... [stammers]

50:27.894 --> 50:31.028
Sorry. I mean, two nights
before you graduated...

50:32.812 --> 50:33.769
What?

50:40.341 --> 50:41.516
[scoffs]

50:45.694 --> 50:47.131
I killed her.

50:54.442 --> 50:56.009
[sniffles]

50:56.096 --> 50:57.184
Let's check that result.

50:58.838 --> 51:01.058
-Yes.
-Let's get those results.

51:09.153 --> 51:11.024
-[sniffles]
-Shit.

51:11.851 --> 51:13.548
What?

51:13.635 --> 51:15.420
This stuff in the box,
it's a biological accelerant.

51:15.507 --> 51:16.725
It's like the stuff
we pulled from the swamp.

51:16.812 --> 51:18.075
Like, it's times...

51:19.119 --> 51:20.120
A lot.

51:20.207 --> 51:23.210
So, someone's dumping it here?

51:23.297 --> 51:25.908
Okay. Pull some samples
I can take back
to the hospital.

51:25.995 --> 51:27.606
What, you think
that could help?

51:27.693 --> 51:29.216
I mean, I think if this is
what's turning our pathogen

51:29.303 --> 51:30.826
into what's making people sick,

51:30.913 --> 51:32.828
maybe there's a way
we can slow the infection.

51:32.915 --> 51:34.961
Susie and the others
aren't going to wait.

51:35.048 --> 51:36.615
All right.

51:36.702 --> 51:38.704
All the samples are here.

51:38.791 --> 51:40.227
And you'll know what you need
better than I do.

51:40.314 --> 51:42.316
So, I'm gonna...

51:42.403 --> 51:44.579
-Where are you going?
-The laptop that
we found on the boat,

51:44.666 --> 51:47.495
this thing is showing
these GPS locations

51:47.582 --> 51:49.671
and I'm thinking

51:49.758 --> 51:52.413
that they're markings where
other accelerant boxes
have been dumped.

51:54.154 --> 51:56.504
So...

51:56.591 --> 51:59.333
I'm gonna fish 'em out
before other people get sick.

51:59.420 --> 52:02.119
Good. Good. Yeah.
I'll see you at the hospital.

52:06.035 --> 52:07.385
You okay?

52:08.864 --> 52:10.083
Yeah.

52:12.781 --> 52:14.000
[sniffles]

52:15.132 --> 52:16.307
[door opens]

52:19.310 --> 52:20.354
Abby...

52:22.008 --> 52:23.183
Why'd you Google me?

52:26.752 --> 52:30.059
I'm sorry, but your query
got back no results.

52:32.061 --> 52:33.541
That was pretty good.

52:38.633 --> 52:40.418
[device beeping]

52:42.681 --> 52:44.465
[beeping intensifies]

52:53.170 --> 52:54.345
[beeping stops]

53:11.405 --> 53:12.841
[Abby]  Listen, I think
I may have something

53:12.928 --> 53:14.626
that could help us
get a handle on this disease.

53:14.713 --> 53:16.541
[Harlan]  We could use
anything you got.

53:16.628 --> 53:19.674
This drug regimen
slowed this thing,
but it hasn't stopped it.

53:19.761 --> 53:21.807
What do you need from me?

53:21.894 --> 53:23.374
I need access
to the hospital's lab

53:23.461 --> 53:25.158
and time to go through
some new findings.

53:25.245 --> 53:27.378
You bet. I'll get on it.

53:27.465 --> 53:28.640
Thank you, Harlan.

53:35.734 --> 53:36.909
