00:00.280 --> 00:02.710
â™ª Get ready... All you lonely girls â™ª

00:03.060 --> 00:04.920
The category is Realness:

00:05.010 --> 00:07.440
Bring It like a Weather Girl.

00:07.610 --> 00:09.820
Who will show us whether it will be

00:09.920 --> 00:12.260
rain or shine?

00:12.350 --> 00:14.119
Who is real enough

00:14.120 --> 00:17.700
to be on Channel 9... ?

00:17.760 --> 00:20.260
Oh, Miss Angel.

00:20.360 --> 00:24.100
Now, this category used to
be for the juicy girls,

00:24.200 --> 00:26.820
but not tonight!

00:30.820 --> 00:32.960
Oh, let it snow.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.980
Let it snow.

00:35.210 --> 00:37.199
This Weather Girl is prepared

00:37.200 --> 00:39.380
for all of the elements.

00:39.410 --> 00:42.110
Yes, Miss Angel. Work, Miss Angel.

00:42.220 --> 00:44.150
Please, judges, your scores.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.320
Please, your scores.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.820
Ten. Ten. Ten.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.220
Ten. Ten.

00:48.270 --> 00:50.160
Grand prize, Miss Angel.

00:50.260 --> 00:52.660
From the upstart house Evangelista.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.679
Angel! Angel! Angel!

00:57.680 --> 00:59.680
Angel! Angel!

01:09.080 --> 01:12.320
Go get Damon and tell him
to meet me in the hallway.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.520
Next category,

01:16.620 --> 01:18.450
you walk in ten minutes.

01:25.660 --> 01:27.230
What's going on?

01:27.330 --> 01:29.020
I am walking this category.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.036
Are you serious? I mean,
hasn't she won this category,

01:31.060 --> 01:33.400
like, ten times? It would be
like fighting Mike Tyson.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.646
You spend enough time in this hall

01:34.670 --> 01:36.059
and you start to be
able to feel the room.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.170
You see the way they
went crazy for Angel?

01:38.270 --> 01:40.140
They're hungry for fresh faces tonight.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.270
The upsets and the underdogs.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.900
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.280
Trust your mother.

01:47.380 --> 01:49.210
I felt the wind in my
face my whole life.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.180
Which means I know when it's at my back.

01:51.290 --> 01:53.190
Now help me get into this dress.

01:54.690 --> 01:57.520
The category is Legendary Runway.

01:57.630 --> 02:00.390
Who will prove themselves
to be mother of all mothers

02:00.490 --> 02:02.290
on the Parisian runway?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.980
Dare anyone challenge
reigning femme queen

02:06.020 --> 02:08.300
Elektra Abundance?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.440
Going once...

02:10.500 --> 02:12.000
Going twice...

02:13.310 --> 02:15.980
Elektra! Elektra!

02:16.020 --> 02:18.820
- No one?
- Elektra! Elektra!

02:18.940 --> 02:21.250
Elektra! Elektra! Elektra!

02:21.350 --> 02:23.450
Elektra! Elektra!

02:23.550 --> 02:25.320
Legendary children,

02:25.420 --> 02:27.550
I do correct myself.

02:27.980 --> 02:30.320
A challenge has been issued.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.860
Clear the floor

02:32.920 --> 02:34.390
or prepare to be trampled

02:34.500 --> 02:36.090
by the magnificence

02:36.100 --> 02:37.580
you are about to witness.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.599
Walking against Elektra Abundance,

02:40.600 --> 02:43.780
Blanca Evangelista!

03:14.140 --> 03:16.560
And turn and lift and walk.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.270
You are the last motherfuckers

03:19.370 --> 03:21.180
on the runway.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.700
Will you receive a standing ovation

03:23.720 --> 03:26.480
from Bianca Jagger and David Bowie?

03:26.580 --> 03:29.579
Or will your collection fall flat

03:29.580 --> 03:31.300
on its face?

03:32.700 --> 03:35.000
To your places, ladies.

03:35.220 --> 03:36.920
To your places.

03:37.190 --> 03:38.440
Blanca!

03:39.440 --> 03:43.020
Blanca! Blanca!

03:43.060 --> 03:44.329
Blanca!

03:44.330 --> 03:46.370
Please, quiet, please.

03:46.470 --> 03:49.200
Quiet, please. Quiet, please.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.400
Silence!

03:51.620 --> 03:54.840
Judges, challenging though it may be,

03:54.900 --> 03:57.139
the future is in your hands now.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.260
Elektra first...

03:58.280 --> 04:01.180
as she is reigning
champion, it is her honor.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.050
Scores, please.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.320
Ten, ten,

04:04.350 --> 04:07.350
ten, ten, nine.

04:07.450 --> 04:08.800
Nine?

04:09.920 --> 04:11.360
Are you blind in one eye?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.190
Have you lost your
ability to count to ten?

04:13.290 --> 04:14.860
I demand an explanation.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.100
I would give you an
explanation if your outfit

04:17.200 --> 04:19.000
didn't look like the inside of a coffin.

04:21.339 --> 04:23.570
Ooh, shade of the panel.

04:25.470 --> 04:27.440
It's fixed! It's fixed.

04:27.540 --> 04:30.580
Who paid you, honey? Who paid you?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.240
Now for Miss Blanca.

04:32.350 --> 04:33.620
Scores, please.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.160
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.520
Blanca! Blanca Evangelista.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.560
Congratulations.

04:52.630 --> 04:56.470
Blanca! Blanca! Blanca! Blanca!

04:56.570 --> 04:59.260
Blanca! Blanca! Blanca!

05:01.610 --> 05:03.440
I must inform the audience

05:03.540 --> 05:05.180
that after tonight's performance

05:05.280 --> 05:08.410
there is another contender
for Mother of the Year.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.520
Miss Blanca has ushered
a new legendary house

05:11.620 --> 05:14.450
into the forefront of the ball world.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.160
Blanca! Blanca! Blanca!

05:20.630 --> 05:22.130
You did that.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.460
I was so proud of you.

05:24.570 --> 05:27.270
You were just like...

05:27.370 --> 05:30.200
Pride goeth forth before the fall.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.270
That win was pure luck.

05:32.370 --> 05:34.270
The judges were merely showing sympathy

05:34.380 --> 05:36.380
for your virgin Legendary Walk.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.580
Or perhaps the fix was in.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.360
I know it was Pray Tell
who helped you make

05:40.450 --> 05:41.880
that ill-fitting potato sack

05:41.980 --> 05:43.460
you had draped over your bones tonight.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.960
Who's to say he didn't tell the judges

05:44.980 --> 05:46.860
to adjust my score so
you and he could share

05:46.880 --> 05:48.250
a moment of glory?

05:48.360 --> 05:50.460
You lost fair and
square and you know it.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.260
I suggest you get used to it.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.390
Please.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.910
You are the Cracker Barrel

05:55.920 --> 05:58.020
to my Gucci and Saint Laurent.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.270
So agitated, Elektra.

06:01.370 --> 06:04.400
And here I thought old age
would mellow a bitch.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.310
It takes more than two trophies

06:08.410 --> 06:10.760
to become a legendary house
and take Mother of the Year.

06:10.940 --> 06:12.640
I would know.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.900
I've won it six times.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.799
True, we aren't where you are,

06:17.800 --> 06:19.320
but we'll get there.

06:19.390 --> 06:21.220
And soon, everything new will be old,

06:21.320 --> 06:23.940
and everything old... meaning you...

06:24.000 --> 06:27.120
will be in the gutter looking up
at my perfectly sewn hemline.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.390
Now, the only house I'm
worried about at the moment

06:29.500 --> 06:31.880
is the International House of Pancakes,

06:31.920 --> 06:34.200
where we will celebrate and raise a fork

06:34.300 --> 06:36.300
of the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity

06:36.400 --> 06:38.640
to your inevitable demise.

06:44.580 --> 06:47.110
- You read her.
- She deserved it.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.380
I got to go.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.420
Hey.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.040
You're an Evangelista, right?

06:59.780 --> 07:01.039
Yeah.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.260
Y'all showed out in there tonight.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.940
Thanks.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.200
I'm Damon.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.620
Ricky.

07:13.570 --> 07:16.240
Did you take a bath in Kouros
Player cologne tonight?

07:16.340 --> 07:18.140
Too much?

07:18.250 --> 07:19.620
It's the right amount if

07:19.650 --> 07:21.690
you're trying to cover up
the stench of a dead body.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.500
No, I like it.

07:25.540 --> 07:27.020
You smell good.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.620
Thank you.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.190
What? You like my tank top?

07:32.290 --> 07:33.430
It's WilliWear.

07:33.530 --> 07:35.260
I mopped it from Macy's.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.100
I tie rubber bands around
the bottom of my sweats.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.430
I could stuff anything down there

07:41.660 --> 07:44.000
and just walk out.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.430
You thought of that yourself?

07:46.440 --> 07:47.920
Smart.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.380
You like smart boys?

07:50.480 --> 07:52.060
If they're cute.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.380
Excuse me.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.840
Oh, okay.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.160
Excuse me.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.760
Oh, man.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.500
You want to go grab a slice
or something? On me.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.200
You mean like a date?

08:17.300 --> 08:20.270
I mean, I'm smart and cute,

08:20.370 --> 08:22.100
and I smell good.

08:22.140 --> 08:25.160
I mean, you could do a lot worse.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.120
Okay, but...

08:30.220 --> 08:32.080
can we go sit at dinner and talk first?

08:32.190 --> 08:34.390
I mean, isn't that what you're
supposed to do on a date?

08:34.780 --> 08:37.320
Oh, see...

08:38.740 --> 08:41.940
Sitting means waitresses,
which means tips.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.660
Slice and a stroll...
that's my idea of a date.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.520
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

08:48.580 --> 08:50.370
Don't go nowhere.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.110
What was all of that?

08:57.210 --> 08:59.620
He asked me if I can go
on a date. Can I go?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.250
He looks like trouble.

09:01.350 --> 09:03.460
But they're always the ones I like, too.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.860
Don't do nothing stupid.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.220
Be back by 3:00 a.m.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.320
No minute later, understand?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.520
Yes, Mother.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.320
All right.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.200
The category is...

09:27.200 --> 09:29.410
Live...

09:29.680 --> 09:31.660
Work...

09:32.020 --> 09:35.480
Pose!

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

09:54.010 --> 09:56.600
I don't get the hype around Janet.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.380
She ain't Michael.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.580
That's the point.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.620
She's not trying to be Michael.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.320
She's stepping out.

10:04.420 --> 10:06.280
No daddy, no husband...

10:06.400 --> 10:09.180
just Janet on her own.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.100
I mean, she's going for her dreams.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.640
I love her for that.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.780
I want that.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.820
Anyway, you're sleeping on Janet.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.420
I mean, in 20 years,

10:24.570 --> 10:27.340
you're gonna look back
and tell me I was right.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.180
You think we're gonna know
each other in 20 years?

10:32.440 --> 10:33.710
I don't know.

10:33.820 --> 10:35.400
I hope.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.000
It's cool.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.360
We're with our people.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.520
No one's gonna do anything.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.520
Come on.

10:55.810 --> 10:58.540
I want to show you something.

11:03.860 --> 11:05.510
Where are you going?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.500
Where are you?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.100
Over here.

11:39.550 --> 11:41.450
Boo!

11:44.750 --> 11:46.620
It's beautiful, right?

11:46.720 --> 11:49.720
This is my favorite spot.

11:49.830 --> 11:51.730
What's that smell? It stinks in here.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.560
I didn't realize you were so bougie.

11:54.660 --> 11:57.500
It's all right. I ain't into thugs.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.800
I don't know how to do this.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.140
Know how to do what?

12:05.280 --> 12:07.300
Um...

12:07.710 --> 12:10.080
I've never kissed anyone before.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.510
Ah.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.620
Hold on. Um... here.

12:29.770 --> 12:32.500
I've wanted to be alone with you
ever since I first saw you.

12:32.600 --> 12:33.800
Me, too.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.230
Wait. We're moving too fast.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.140
Ah, but I'm in love with you.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.120
What? You just met me.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.750
I know, but it's like I've
known you my whole life.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.600
Come on, let's have some fun
before you meet someone better.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.220
I-I won't meet anybody better.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.820
Oh, yeah, you will.

12:55.930 --> 12:57.830
You're gonna be a star.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.800
You'll forget all about me.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.730
You really think I'm gonna be a star?

13:01.830 --> 13:03.730
Of course.

13:03.830 --> 13:07.100
I believe in you.

13:15.910 --> 13:18.680
- Ricky. Ricky.
- What? What? What?

13:21.680 --> 13:23.320
I'm not ready.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.850
I'm sorry.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.499
Maybe

13:29.500 --> 13:32.380
we can go on a few dates first?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.300
Yeah. Sure.

13:38.340 --> 13:41.060
Uh, how about next Saturday?

13:41.740 --> 13:44.320
We can grab a slice, catch a movie?

13:45.640 --> 13:46.780
Yeah, I'd like that.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.000
Cool.

13:52.620 --> 13:53.940
It's a date.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.060
Come on. This is...

14:01.500 --> 14:02.820
Bougie.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.660
It stinks in here.

14:04.790 --> 14:07.560
- Oh, God.
- Where are you taking me?

14:54.810 --> 14:56.720
Damon?

14:58.680 --> 14:59.910
Yeah?

15:14.760 --> 15:16.320
Sit down.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.640
Where have you been?

15:30.920 --> 15:32.380
Ricky took me to the pier.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.920
You're two hours late.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.520
I won't tolerate you breaking my rules.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.300
Were you out drinking?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.460
- No.
- Did he give you any drugs?

15:43.340 --> 15:45.590
No, ma'am. Mother.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.860
So what possible reason could
you have for disobeying me?

15:50.320 --> 15:51.670
Did you have sex?

15:51.770 --> 15:53.160
No.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.340
We...

15:56.220 --> 15:57.399
We kissed.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.920
- And?
- And that's it.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.710
He wanted to do more, but...

16:04.650 --> 16:07.450
I didn't want my first
time to be at the pier.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.940
Did your daddy ever give you the talk?

16:17.080 --> 16:18.160
The talk?

16:18.200 --> 16:19.860
The birds and the bees.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.660
Yeah, he did.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.670
It was really awful.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.020
I mean, he was saying
all this stuff about

16:29.040 --> 16:31.740
women's anatomy and-and
things like that, and...

16:32.240 --> 16:34.440
the whole time I was thinking,

16:34.540 --> 16:37.060
this is not the information
I need to get.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.510
Like, Sweet Baby Jesus,
this is not helping me.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.420
But, you know, I-I couldn't ask him

16:42.520 --> 16:43.830
the questions I really wanted to know,

16:43.850 --> 16:45.650
which was about...

16:45.760 --> 16:48.620
what men do together and stuff,

16:49.180 --> 16:52.590
or... I'd be found out.

16:55.820 --> 16:59.500
And... I was afraid he'd kill me.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.570
Well, here's what no one
will tell you but me.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.380
Gay life is hard.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.260
Here.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.079
No. I-I-I don't need these.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.930
I-I'm not planning on
having sex with Ricky.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.420
Oh, child, no one ever
plans on having sex.

17:23.530 --> 17:25.460
And I can't be your mother
and your conscience.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.630
I'm not gonna always be
here to protect you.

17:27.730 --> 17:30.280
You are a good-looking young man.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.240
And soon you are gonna want to
start exploring, but you got

17:33.280 --> 17:34.800
to make smart choices.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.819
Now, as a gay man,

17:36.820 --> 17:38.439
you have options when it comes to sex.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.120
You can be a top or a bottom.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.820
Uh, how will I know which one I am?

17:42.920 --> 17:44.980
Well, there's no rule book.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.620
Sometimes you want to give,
sometimes you want to receive.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.760
Sometimes you want all the pleasure.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.160
It's up to you.

17:52.220 --> 17:54.100
- What if I'm a bottom...
- Mm-hmm.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.520
... and I fall for another bottom?

17:56.630 --> 17:58.136
- Oh, don't.
- You said there was no rules!

17:58.160 --> 18:00.480
Oh, so what y'all gonna be
doing, bumping purses all night?

18:04.530 --> 18:07.160
Look, don't overthink it.

18:08.140 --> 18:11.260
When you find the right
guy, you'll figure it out.

18:11.470 --> 18:13.780
Just promise me you'll protect yourself.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.299
There's a virus out there,

18:15.300 --> 18:17.720
and if you catch it, it will kill you.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.480
If you need condoms, you
go and ask for them,

18:20.580 --> 18:21.779
and if I'm not around,

18:21.780 --> 18:23.590
you go to the clinic. Understood?

18:24.820 --> 18:26.140
Yes, Mother.

18:31.590 --> 18:34.460
When will I know that I'm ready?

18:35.380 --> 18:36.980
Well, when you have sex,

18:37.020 --> 18:39.800
that's your decision to
make, no one else's.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.820
Just listen to that
voice in your head...

18:42.940 --> 18:44.800
the one that told you
to come to New York.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.670
That voice is intuition,

18:46.780 --> 18:48.740
and I promise you she'll
guide you, and if

18:48.840 --> 18:51.280
you ever feel unsure about
what that bitch has to say,

18:51.300 --> 18:53.240
you come straight home to Mother.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.600
Thank you.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.540
Damon...

19:15.570 --> 19:17.640
if I could go back in time

19:17.740 --> 19:20.570
and make different choices, I would.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.440
Don't ever give away your gifts...

19:26.200 --> 19:27.520
for no one.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.790
Mm.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.200
Hey, you found it!

20:31.040 --> 20:32.480
This better be worth it,

20:32.580 --> 20:35.160
'cause I'm missing 227
to come meet your ass.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.890
Why are we meeting here?

20:37.990 --> 20:39.590
Is this some kind of joke?

20:39.690 --> 20:41.260
No, it was in the Village Voice.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.380
Best gay bar in Manhattan
two years running.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.140
I wanted something special

20:46.180 --> 20:48.200
to celebrate me snagging
my first trophy.

20:48.260 --> 20:50.600
You do know they don't
serve our kind here?

20:50.640 --> 20:51.930
Bitch, shut up.

20:52.030 --> 20:54.470
Our money is just as good as anyone's.

20:54.570 --> 20:57.040
Happy Halloween, ladies.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.860
- I'm done.
- Uh-uh. No!

20:59.880 --> 21:01.540
One drink.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.480
I got a proposition for you.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.580
My house is going to crush all others.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.960
They're gonna place a
statue on the piers

21:11.040 --> 21:12.880
to commemorate us one day.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.060
Big talk after one trophy.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.579
Now's the time to get in line

21:17.580 --> 21:19.050
before the line to get in starts

21:19.060 --> 21:21.520
to snake its way around the block.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.670
I need a lieutenant.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.640
A second in command.

21:26.670 --> 21:28.060
Who? Me?

21:28.100 --> 21:30.180
You hate Elektra just as much as anyone.

21:30.260 --> 21:32.100
All she does is look down on you,

21:32.180 --> 21:34.160
bragging about her rich daddy

21:34.180 --> 21:36.740
and her Weezy Jefferson
apartment up on the East Side.

21:36.850 --> 21:38.750
She don't care about you.

21:38.850 --> 21:40.780
And I'm not just starting a house.

21:41.420 --> 21:43.880
We're gonna be a family that
looks out for one another.

21:45.060 --> 21:48.100
Elektra would rip your weave
right off of your head

21:48.160 --> 21:49.880
if she knew you was
trying to steal me away.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.360
Oh, so, what, you want to tell her?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.630
Fuck her.

21:52.730 --> 21:54.730
I ain't got no loyalty to her.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.760
But she helps me win,

21:56.820 --> 21:58.240
and I like to win.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.320
Which means joining a house

22:00.380 --> 22:02.439
that ain't no more than a toddler

22:02.440 --> 22:05.240
still soiling in his diapers
ain't never gonna happen.

22:05.740 --> 22:09.320
Besides, maybe I want to
start my own house one day.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.680
Well, hello, handsome.

22:14.780 --> 22:16.620
I'll have a Manhattan,

22:16.720 --> 22:19.450
and my friend here is
going to have a Malibu...

22:19.460 --> 22:22.180
Malibu Rum and Tab on the rocks.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.300
This one's on me, but
then you got to go.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.720
I got ten guys in here asking
me if it's drag night.

22:27.820 --> 22:30.000
Well, I'm sorry. We're not in drag.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.660
- We're women.
- Even better.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.180
We don't like women in here.
This is a gay bar.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.800
Well, I want to see a manager.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.240
Girl, why you always got to
pick fights you can't win?

22:42.280 --> 22:44.380
Because these are the
ones worth fighting.

22:44.460 --> 22:45.480
I'm Mitchell the manager.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.440
Can we speak outside where it's quieter?

22:58.120 --> 23:00.940
How could you discriminate
against me in my own community?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.430
This bar is called Boy Lounge.

23:03.530 --> 23:06.000
We have a specific clientele...

23:06.160 --> 23:08.440
gay, under 35...

23:08.460 --> 23:10.440
- White?
- Frankly, yes.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.470
The New York City
nightlife is segregated.

23:12.570 --> 23:13.939
Look, I've got a friend.

23:13.940 --> 23:15.160
She works at the Cubby Hole.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.980
I'll call her. You guys can go.
You can drink free all night.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.419
But I don't want that scene tonight.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.550
I'm sorry. I'm not
throwing a costume party.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.400
Oh, this is not over.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.490
Bitch, it was over before it started.

23:28.590 --> 23:31.660
Everybody needs someone to
make them feel superior.

23:31.980 --> 23:33.800
That line ends with us, though.

23:33.940 --> 23:36.430
This shit runs downhill past the women,

23:36.530 --> 23:38.040
the blacks, Latins,

23:38.160 --> 23:41.670
gays until it reaches the
bottom and lands on our kind.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.920
Five, six, seven, eight.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.580
Uh. Reach.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.880
Uh-huh.

23:50.980 --> 23:53.580
And legs! That's right. Oh!

23:54.850 --> 23:56.620
Huh. Uh-huh.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.850
Yes. Yes.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.490
Five, six, seven, eight.

24:03.590 --> 24:05.260
Yes! Reach!

24:05.340 --> 24:07.730
Uh-huh. And...

24:08.100 --> 24:10.500
breathing!

24:10.600 --> 24:13.160
Uh, and...

24:13.840 --> 24:16.759
All right, everybody,

24:16.760 --> 24:18.800
that's the day.

24:34.620 --> 24:35.840
Mr. Richards?

24:37.380 --> 24:39.260
You weren't rehearsing today.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.680
I wasn't?

24:40.740 --> 24:43.530
No. You were dancing.

24:43.630 --> 24:45.500
Rehearsal is getting ready for life.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.500
Dancing is living it.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.500
For an artist, greatness happens

24:49.610 --> 24:53.000
when you can take something organized

24:53.120 --> 24:55.860
and make it feel like it was improvised.

24:55.940 --> 24:57.639
You've been doing that,

24:57.640 --> 25:00.400
and that's a skill I cannot teach.

25:00.550 --> 25:02.520
You either have it, or you don't.

25:02.620 --> 25:04.520
Great job.

25:04.620 --> 25:06.000
I'm impressed.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.200
Thank you so much. That
means so much to me.

25:08.260 --> 25:11.280
I'm taking some students to
the ballet on Saturday night.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.600
Mostly seniors, but one
of them has the flu,

25:13.620 --> 25:14.800
so I have an extra ticket.

25:14.820 --> 25:17.830
It's a story of heartbreak,
betrayal, revenge,

25:17.930 --> 25:20.670
the redemptive power of true love.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.470
That sounds like a play or something.

25:22.570 --> 25:24.960
Dancers tell stories with their bodies.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.610
Technique is nothing
if it doesn't reveal

25:26.710 --> 25:28.510
some personal truth.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.980
Be outside Roosevelt Hall
at 7:00 on Saturday night.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.779
This is a big opportunity for you.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.520
Don't blow it.

25:35.620 --> 25:36.860
I'll be there.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.790
Yes.

25:46.060 --> 25:48.540
Why are you eating like
this is your last meal?

25:48.640 --> 25:50.180
- 'Cause this food is bomb.
- Ugh.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.540
Close your mouth, hood rat.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.710
- Mmm, mmm.
- Oh, my God.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.900
Um, excuse me. Where the
hell are you going?

25:58.960 --> 26:00.719
Sit your ass down. We are having

26:00.720 --> 26:03.040
a mandatory family meeting.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.220
And where did that come from?

26:06.460 --> 26:07.680
I bought it.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.600
- With what money?
- Money.

26:09.660 --> 26:12.280
Oh, how does anyone make
good money these days?

26:12.420 --> 26:15.160
Waiting tables, cleaning gutters,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.839
working as a street pharmacist.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.470
Yo, mind your business.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.240
- Are you dealing?
- No.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.659
If I find out that you're doing

26:22.660 --> 26:24.540
anything illegal, you will
be out of this house.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.480
- Do you understand me?
- Yup.

26:26.580 --> 26:27.750
Hey, y'all.

26:27.850 --> 26:30.550
See, now, if that was me,
I'd have got my ass read

26:30.650 --> 26:31.780
like a library book.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.920
Where did you get that jacket from?

26:33.940 --> 26:35.420
Oh, I bought it at the Goodwill.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.560
- Oh.
- In the dollar bin.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.640
My dance instructor is taking me

26:39.760 --> 26:41.560
to the ballet this Saturday.

26:41.660 --> 26:43.430
Oh, you fancy, huh?

26:44.870 --> 26:46.979
Well, that is a moment

26:46.980 --> 26:49.880
to celebrate... one of my
children is going to the ballet.

26:49.940 --> 26:53.720
I mean, I was supposed to
have a date with Ricky,

26:53.760 --> 26:55.960
but I don't have his phone
number to reschedule.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.499
Don't really matter if you show up.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.100
Ricky's a hit-it-and-quit-it type.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.510
Trust and believe, you've
already been replaced.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.620
Okay, that's enough. Thank you.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.160
Damon, soak this moment up, okay?

27:06.200 --> 27:08.520
This is just the beginning
of many more doors

27:08.620 --> 27:10.720
like this one opening
for you, for all of us.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.490
You made your mother proud.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.639
All right, now,

27:17.640 --> 27:19.640
I got something to
share with all of y'all.

27:19.670 --> 27:21.259
This may come as a shock, but

27:21.260 --> 27:22.480
I'm not gonna be competing in the

27:22.500 --> 27:24.400
Saint Laurent ball this weekend.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.440
- What? Wh-Why?
- What?

27:27.540 --> 27:29.679
There are things more
important than prizes,

27:29.680 --> 27:30.900
like my dignity.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.450
Wait. Did something happen?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.250
I went to a gay bar downtown

27:34.260 --> 27:35.580
for a celebratory cocktail,

27:35.680 --> 27:37.520
and the bastards refused to serve me.

27:37.620 --> 27:39.199
I don't understand.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.200
I mean, if they're gay, why
did they turn you away?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.520
Gay, straight... it doesn't matter.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.590
They all think we got
psychological issues.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.760
They don't see us as real.

27:50.860 --> 27:52.280
It's not fair.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.340
Nothing in life is fair.

27:54.470 --> 27:55.840
But that's okay, though.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.670
I'm-a do something about it,

27:57.770 --> 27:59.450
so that my children's world is better

27:59.460 --> 28:01.500
than the one I grew up in.

28:28.870 --> 28:31.000
You're asking for trouble.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.470
I want a Manhattan.

28:32.570 --> 28:34.870
I want a drink just like everybody else.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.260
Yeah, get her out.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.740
I should be able to
drink wherever I want!

29:06.880 --> 29:09.060
There's my Jersey boy.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.500
How do you like the new de Ville?

29:10.580 --> 29:11.740
Like driving a cloud.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.760
I told him to get the new de Ville.

29:12.780 --> 29:13.926
He's got a good eye for style,

29:13.950 --> 29:15.910
but he needs a little help
from the professionals.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.879
Hey. How you doing?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.820
Come on in.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.670
We never used to have so many.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.810
Yeah, well, this is what
success looks like.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.410
You think we're successful enough

29:46.510 --> 29:48.260
- to get a dishwasher?
- You serious?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.280
Do you see how underwater we
are now? Look at all this.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.420
We have a Cadillac in the garage.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.600
There's a ball gown in mine

29:54.660 --> 29:56.590
that costs $900 that I've worn once.

29:56.690 --> 29:57.690
If we don't have any money, then

29:57.691 --> 29:58.840
how are you paying for all these things?

29:58.860 --> 29:59.860
We need all that stuff.

29:59.930 --> 30:01.760
We need a dishwasher.

30:01.860 --> 30:04.950
We have a baby, and I'm
up doing dishes by hand

30:04.960 --> 30:06.530
until The Tonight Show starts.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.019
You don't understand how it works

30:11.020 --> 30:12.440
out there in Manhattan, okay?

30:12.540 --> 30:14.139
You have to look the part
or they won't let you

30:14.140 --> 30:15.640
into the big club.

30:15.740 --> 30:18.160
You wore that gown to the big
event at 21 the other night,

30:18.220 --> 30:19.586
and now they all think
you're one of them.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.300
- So what?
- So what?!

30:24.020 --> 30:25.520
You know anybody with a corner office

30:25.620 --> 30:27.380
in one of those skyscrapers in Midtown?

30:27.440 --> 30:28.700
Or a place in Montauk of their own?

30:28.720 --> 30:30.060
- No.
- No.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.690
You don't. Because people
like us don't get invited.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.220
We don't get a shot at it.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.706
But I got a one-in-a-million
chance here,

30:35.730 --> 30:37.860
and I made that happen
because I'm adaptable.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.470
I know how to play the part.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.120
But you have no idea

30:41.200 --> 30:42.639
how much pressure that puts on me.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.900
I have to be on 100% of the time,

30:45.010 --> 30:47.470
and I can't do that if
you're second-guessing me

30:47.580 --> 30:50.060
and pressuring me to buy
things that you don't need

30:50.080 --> 30:51.480
and that we can't afford!

30:51.500 --> 30:54.610
Baby, baby, is any of
this really worth it?

30:59.260 --> 31:00.550
I got to go back to the office.

31:00.660 --> 31:02.220
It's Saturday.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.620
Yeah, it's Saturday.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.706
If I'm gonna have to put up
with this version of you,

31:05.730 --> 31:07.530
I should at least get a
dishwasher out of it.

31:07.630 --> 31:10.700
Asshole.

31:31.580 --> 31:33.840
Mr. Richards, I'm glad
you could join us.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.200
You're looking sharp.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.440
Really?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.710
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.080
Ah, showtime.

31:42.420 --> 31:44.080
Let's find our seats.

33:11.770 --> 33:14.110
Applause comes at the end.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.340
Hey!

33:58.320 --> 33:59.790
You a cop?

34:00.420 --> 34:02.440
I'm looking for Angel. I'm a friend.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.320
I'm sure you are.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.890
She's working indoors now.

34:05.990 --> 34:08.360
Me, myself, I prefer the fresh air.

34:08.420 --> 34:09.876
What, you mean, like,
she got a regular job

34:09.900 --> 34:11.420
at a store or something?

34:11.920 --> 34:13.870
You know that place in Times Square,

34:13.969 --> 34:15.400
Show World?

34:16.560 --> 34:18.340
Go give her a visit.

34:57.840 --> 35:01.079
_

35:20.970 --> 35:22.700
Got to buy tokens here.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.260
Ten-dollar minimum.

35:27.110 --> 35:29.740
How's it work if I'm looking
for someone specific?

35:29.850 --> 35:31.750
I'm here to see Angel.

35:31.850 --> 35:33.300
Yeah, he's popular.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.820
She.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.220
Whatever you say, boss.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.040
Second-to-last door on the left.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.660
Well...

36:41.780 --> 36:44.850
if it isn't my uptown businessman.

36:44.950 --> 36:46.380
I knew you'd find me.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.890
You can't stay away from
your Angel too long.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.660
Why are you here?

36:54.760 --> 36:56.920
This place isn't right for you.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.930
I make $125 a night here.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.900
And no one touches me.

37:03.060 --> 37:04.900
Don't you want me to be safe?

37:05.320 --> 37:07.039
I get jealous

37:07.040 --> 37:09.220
that so many men see you like this.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.520
Hmm.

37:10.710 --> 37:12.520
Does that make you mad?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.750
Do I look like a kept woman to you?

37:17.580 --> 37:18.880
A kept woman

37:19.740 --> 37:21.780
would be in a high-rise apartment

37:21.800 --> 37:24.560
in Riverdale with a
refrigerator full of groceries

37:24.790 --> 37:26.580
and a mink coat in her closet.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.600
Do you ever do things with guys here?

37:44.920 --> 37:46.440
Sweetheart...

37:47.880 --> 37:49.480
a lady never tells.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.220
And I'm not appreciating your attitude.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.920
Especially considering
this is the first time

37:56.020 --> 37:59.320
I'm seeing you in three weeks.

38:03.970 --> 38:05.970
I can't stop thinking about you.

38:07.800 --> 38:08.870
At work.

38:08.970 --> 38:11.670
If I'm in bed with my wife.

38:11.770 --> 38:13.319
I drive by the piers almost every night,

38:13.320 --> 38:15.040
but I get too scared to pull over.

38:16.950 --> 38:18.280
Scared of what?

38:20.080 --> 38:22.320
I don't like you in a place like this.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.800
A lady needs to make a living.

38:29.260 --> 38:32.380
Can I take you to get some... food?

38:32.790 --> 38:34.790
Coffee or something?

38:37.870 --> 38:39.830
I have break in an hour.

38:40.140 --> 38:41.580
We can walk to a diner.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.780
Okay.

38:43.940 --> 38:45.840
Where should I wait for you?

39:02.360 --> 39:04.420
The category is Dynasty.

39:04.520 --> 39:08.020
I want to see all the rich bitch fantasy

39:08.080 --> 39:09.760
in full effect.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.740
Ah, yes.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.700
Looking like a ghetto Banjee Fallon.

39:21.260 --> 39:23.720
Work, mama. Scores, scores, please.

39:23.780 --> 39:25.000
Yeah!

39:25.480 --> 39:27.600
Here we have Dominique Deveraux,

39:27.750 --> 39:29.580
replete with boa.

39:31.720 --> 39:34.800
Darling, the champagne is burnt.

39:40.590 --> 39:42.290
Oh, and what have we here?

39:42.390 --> 39:45.580
Bringing her best attempt
at Heather Locklear.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.960
Mmm, darling,

39:49.020 --> 39:51.900
more like T.J. Hooker.

39:54.940 --> 39:57.759
Hmm, is it Krystle Carrington...

39:57.760 --> 39:59.760
Linda Evans?

40:00.060 --> 40:03.050
Oh, my children, I'm
afeared that this show

40:03.150 --> 40:04.980
is about to be canceled.

40:05.050 --> 40:06.920
Children, I repeat,

40:07.020 --> 40:10.090
the category is Dynasty,

40:10.190 --> 40:12.990
not goddamn Falcon Crest!

40:13.090 --> 40:16.330
We don't need no spinoffs
up in this bitch.

40:20.100 --> 40:22.460
The eleganza!

40:22.500 --> 40:25.520
Miss Elektra is bringing
us Alexis Carrington

40:25.580 --> 40:27.040
in full effect.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.600
Show them how it's done.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.140
Show them how it's done.

40:33.780 --> 40:36.219
Elektra! Elektra!

40:36.220 --> 40:38.220
Elektra! Elektra!

40:47.620 --> 40:51.060
Showing the children how it's done.

40:51.160 --> 40:54.000
And the scores are ten, ten, ten...

40:54.100 --> 40:56.000
tens across the board.

40:56.100 --> 40:59.080
And the grand prize goes to,

40:59.100 --> 41:01.520
with no competition,

41:01.560 --> 41:04.800
Miss Elektra, Abundance.

41:09.950 --> 41:11.850
Once again.

41:11.950 --> 41:14.020
She brings it every time.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.090
She brings it every time.

41:34.140 --> 41:35.620
Why the attitude?

41:35.680 --> 41:37.140
We did amazing tonight.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.810
A victory's hollow if there's
no real competition.

41:39.820 --> 41:41.250
How dare The House of Evangelista

41:41.260 --> 41:42.620
not show their faces tonight?

41:42.680 --> 41:44.180
Where the fuck was Blanca?

41:47.440 --> 41:49.020
Is this the life you want,

41:49.100 --> 41:50.640
dancing in a place like that?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.820
It's safe behind the glass.

41:53.930 --> 41:55.190
Money is good.

41:55.290 --> 41:57.700
And I like being admired.

42:02.260 --> 42:03.930
I don't like other men touching you.

42:05.420 --> 42:07.170
How much do you make a week?

42:09.380 --> 42:11.400
You trying to put me on
a retainer, sweetheart?

42:11.440 --> 42:13.100
I'm sorry. I didn't...

42:13.160 --> 42:14.560
I didn't mean it like that.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.620
What if I got you a place of your own?

42:23.340 --> 42:24.990
A kept woman?

42:25.980 --> 42:27.960
I must warn you,

42:28.440 --> 42:30.030
I cannot cook.

42:30.130 --> 42:31.799
Unless you count

42:31.800 --> 42:33.520
opening a can of SpaghettiOs.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.420
I want a year lease.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.739
I don't want you running away
and leaving me holding the bag

42:38.740 --> 42:40.046
once you get me out of your system.

42:40.070 --> 42:42.110
No, it's not like that. I swear.

42:45.380 --> 42:46.680
But okay.

42:47.300 --> 42:48.440
A year.

42:53.300 --> 42:54.950
I can't leave my wife, though,

42:55.520 --> 42:58.090
or promise that I could
see you every day.

42:58.190 --> 43:00.360
I can't help you if I
can't keep my life.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.360
I should refuse you, right?

43:04.480 --> 43:06.000
Demand commitment.

43:06.600 --> 43:09.870
But I've also learned
how to keep my dignity,

43:10.220 --> 43:13.000
even when I'm kneeling down for scraps

43:13.720 --> 43:15.260
under the table.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.499
My hope is that, over time,

43:19.500 --> 43:21.580
I can help you want more for yourself.

43:22.950 --> 43:25.150
You talking about dreams?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.850
Aspirations?

43:28.480 --> 43:30.050
Those are only words

43:30.160 --> 43:32.399
that only last in the suburbs.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.940
All I know

43:34.720 --> 43:36.990
is that I'm-a have a roof over my head,

43:37.100 --> 43:39.419
a little spending cash for clothes

43:39.420 --> 43:41.200
for the balls,

43:42.140 --> 43:45.350
and my chances of not
getting killed in the gutter

43:45.380 --> 43:47.900
just increased considerably.

43:48.010 --> 43:50.040
I'm fine with that for now.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.950
What's your deal here?

43:59.050 --> 44:00.540
Usually, the ones like you

44:00.620 --> 44:03.090
are either gay... won't admit it...

44:03.740 --> 44:05.159
or straight

44:05.160 --> 44:06.779
but too afraid to ask their wife

44:06.780 --> 44:08.200
to stick a finger up their behind.

44:08.220 --> 44:09.990
Jesus.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.360
I'm neither of those things.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.480
I'm not gay.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.520
I don't understand.

44:17.940 --> 44:19.840
You hadn't touched me.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.970
Not a blow job in the car or nothing.

44:22.070 --> 44:23.860
But you want to possess me.

44:23.980 --> 44:25.100
Why?

44:26.580 --> 44:28.280
What are you?

44:30.700 --> 44:32.020
I'm no one.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.220
I want what I'm supposed to want,

44:34.320 --> 44:35.636
I wear what I'm supposed to wear,

44:35.660 --> 44:37.380
and I work where I'm supposed to work.

44:39.460 --> 44:41.290
I stand for nothing.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.579
I've never fought in a war

44:43.580 --> 44:44.899
and I probably won't ever have to,

44:44.900 --> 44:47.100
'cause the next one's gonna kill us all.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.250
I can buy things I can't afford,

44:49.260 --> 44:51.300
which means they're never really mine.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.560
I don't live.

44:54.700 --> 44:56.070
I don't believe.

44:56.540 --> 44:58.000
I accumulate.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.110
I'm a brand...

45:01.840 --> 45:04.010
a middle-class white guy.

45:05.180 --> 45:07.020
But you're who you are

45:07.560 --> 45:09.540
even though the price you pay for it

45:09.620 --> 45:11.960
is being disinvited from
the rest of the world.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.340
I'm the one playing dress-up.

45:15.580 --> 45:18.250
Is it wrong to want to be
with one of the few people

45:18.260 --> 45:20.860
in the world who isn't,

45:21.860 --> 45:25.280
to have one person in my
life who I know is real?

45:37.420 --> 45:39.380
You think of me as a real woman?

45:42.480 --> 45:45.460
You'd be crazy to choose this
life if you didn't have to.

45:52.780 --> 45:54.200
I...

45:54.920 --> 45:56.600
have to get back to work.

45:57.640 --> 45:59.000
You know where to find me

45:59.100 --> 46:01.460
once you've made all your arrangements.

46:03.910 --> 46:05.180
Hey. Hey.

46:10.700 --> 46:12.320
Do you believe in love?

46:12.980 --> 46:15.640
Or is that just a word
for the suburbs, too?

46:30.040 --> 46:32.520
How was your fancy trip to the ballet?

46:32.620 --> 46:35.570
It was magical.

46:35.580 --> 46:37.520
You know, one day,

46:37.660 --> 46:40.760
I'm-a be on that stage, and I
expect you to come and see me.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.540
How much are you gonna
pay me to show up?

46:42.640 --> 46:44.580
Uh, you know what?

46:44.680 --> 46:46.280
- Forget I even invited you.
- Nah,

46:46.360 --> 46:48.340
I'll show up for, like, 15
minutes before dipping.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.790
Uh-uh.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.020
You're too much, though.

46:52.060 --> 46:53.960
Was it worth ditching your date, though?

46:55.940 --> 46:57.200
I think so.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.580
A'ight, so then...

47:18.580 --> 47:20.679
You shouldn't be selling
drugs out in the open.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.839
It's dangerous.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.219
If Blanca finds out, she's gonna take...

47:23.220 --> 47:25.720
Only way she'll find out
is if you flap your gums.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.540
Yo, I got to run.

47:49.220 --> 47:50.440
Ricky?

47:51.040 --> 47:52.950
Hey, uh, Damon.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.080
This is Midnight.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.920
Nice to meet you.

48:03.180 --> 48:04.860
Can we speak in private?

48:07.260 --> 48:09.030
Can you give me a minute?

48:12.900 --> 48:15.080
Is that your girlfriend?

48:16.700 --> 48:18.320
I'm not the boyfriend type.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.719
So what type are you?

48:19.720 --> 48:21.496
The type that sits around
waiting in the pizza shop

48:21.520 --> 48:23.080
for an hour and a half like an asshole.

48:25.460 --> 48:28.340
I'm the asshole, and I'm sorry.

48:28.460 --> 48:30.660
I didn't show up because
I was at the ballet.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.640
- My teacher gave me a ticket.
- School?

48:32.720 --> 48:34.220
I thought you wasn't bougie.

48:36.260 --> 48:39.000
I didn't move to New York
looking for a relationship.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.740
I mean, I came here to
make my dreams come true.

48:41.860 --> 48:44.420
I got kicked out of my
home for being gay.

48:44.500 --> 48:46.099
And then I spent weeks on a park bench

48:46.100 --> 48:47.200
because I had nothing.

48:47.310 --> 48:48.980
I mean, Blanca gave me

48:49.020 --> 48:50.579
a warm meal and a place to stay,

48:50.580 --> 48:51.719
and being a part of her house

48:51.720 --> 48:53.059
means I have to follow her rules.

48:53.060 --> 48:55.780
If I have to choose between
education and dating,

48:56.280 --> 48:58.579
- I choose the ballet.
- Whatever. It's all good.

49:00.840 --> 49:03.050
Seems like you moved on,
so no big deal, right?

49:03.060 --> 49:04.120
Yeah, no biggie.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.920
You know, you ain't the only one
who came here with a dream.

49:06.990 --> 49:09.120
I'm still sleeping on that park bench.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.960
You could join a house.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.399
Don't nobody want me
to join their house.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.020
- You can't sleep on the street.
- It's what I do every night.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.179
Just yesterday, I stole a couple 40s

49:17.180 --> 49:18.900
and got smashed right over there.

49:21.060 --> 49:23.180
You know, you were smart
for not showing up.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.200
I'm just a fuckup.

49:25.220 --> 49:27.580
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.500
You know, when I first
saw you, I thought,

49:33.220 --> 49:35.420
"That shorty's going places."

49:35.800 --> 49:37.700
Guess I thought maybe you might...

49:38.340 --> 49:40.060
take me with you.

49:41.740 --> 49:43.840
Not the first time
I've been left behind.

50:03.260 --> 50:04.500
Mani-pedi?

50:04.560 --> 50:06.850
Just a top coat, please.

50:06.950 --> 50:07.950
I want her.

50:08.620 --> 50:10.050
Oh, she's on break.

50:10.980 --> 50:12.720
Do your ears not work,

50:12.780 --> 50:15.890
or is the customer not always
right in this establishment?

50:15.990 --> 50:18.660
I said I want her.

50:20.030 --> 50:22.100
Oh, I am sorry, sweetie, I'm on break.

50:22.740 --> 50:25.870
I'm sure, even worn as you look,

50:25.970 --> 50:28.420
that you can find the
fortitude to stick around

50:28.520 --> 50:31.300
and give a top coat to the
woman who raised you.

50:32.060 --> 50:33.820
Oh, what is that, Coral Punch?

50:33.860 --> 50:36.680
I assume you have Revlon or Max Factor.

50:36.780 --> 50:40.560
Don't even think about putting
Yardley on these fingers.

50:42.350 --> 50:44.850
You know, you can learn
so much about a person

50:44.860 --> 50:46.660
by looking at their hands.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.920
All the wigs and

50:47.960 --> 50:50.780
clothes and plastic surgery don't matter

50:50.820 --> 50:53.100
when you're looking at a woman's hands.

50:53.540 --> 50:55.540
It always reveals her real age.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.460
You're one to talk

50:57.660 --> 51:01.620
in your stained white coat,
looking like a peasant.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.310
Look at me.

51:03.780 --> 51:05.910
You're clearly not winning the game.

51:06.010 --> 51:08.210
Nor are you playing it fairly.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.659
Do you think you can just
come to the balls and beat me

51:10.660 --> 51:12.879
with a lucky break and then disappear?

51:12.880 --> 51:14.980
Denying me my opportunity
for redemption?

51:15.090 --> 51:16.950
Leaving me twisting in the wind?

51:17.060 --> 51:19.520
You are so anxious to have
me come and crush you again?

51:19.580 --> 51:21.020
Oh, please.

51:21.130 --> 51:22.999
You win one trophy,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.920
and you talk like you're a legend.

51:25.030 --> 51:27.719
Any hoodlum or orangutan off the streets

51:27.720 --> 51:29.160
can snag one trophy.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.160
I've been busy with other business.

51:31.260 --> 51:34.480
Oh. I heard about that "other" business.

51:34.940 --> 51:37.300
You're a regular transvestite Norma Rae.

51:39.100 --> 51:40.600
Don't get me wrong,

51:41.180 --> 51:43.560
I admire your determination.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.920
I have known you since
you were a wee tot,

51:46.980 --> 51:49.639
and while you're not nearly as stunning

51:49.640 --> 51:51.379
and well-kept as I am,

51:51.380 --> 51:54.940
and you could clearly use a
delivery of Pond's Cold Cream

51:54.980 --> 51:57.060
for that ashy complexion,

51:57.160 --> 51:59.800
you have always been impossible to stop

51:59.820 --> 52:01.800
once you get an idea in your head.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.620
But take it from a woman of the world:

52:04.820 --> 52:06.720
you're punching at windmills.

52:06.940 --> 52:09.600
These gay white boys don't
want anything to do with you,

52:09.680 --> 52:11.480
and never will.

52:11.620 --> 52:14.860
I told the children of my house
that I was fighting for them.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.340
I won't back down.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.640
You're not Rosa Parks,
sitting up front of the bus.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.020
You're a tired, old queen

52:21.120 --> 52:23.199
looking to sip a margarita
with some white boy

52:23.200 --> 52:25.579
- in Sergio Valente blue jeans.
- You know, I know about

52:25.580 --> 52:27.920
your life, even though you
never speak about it.

52:28.030 --> 52:31.960
About your gentleman caller who
showers you in rhinestones

52:32.060 --> 52:33.900
and keeps a house over your head.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.870
You're settled, comfortable.

52:35.970 --> 52:38.640
The only fights you have
left are with your wrinkles

52:38.720 --> 52:41.140
and your cellulite and
walking the balls.

52:41.240 --> 52:42.940
And, bitch, that's because you're old.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.160
If I cut you open, there
would be nothing but dust

52:45.220 --> 52:47.110
and 50 rings to count.

52:47.940 --> 52:49.950
Now, your generation got
us to where we are.

52:49.960 --> 52:52.520
I'll give you that, I'll
give you all of that.

52:52.580 --> 52:55.180
But I'm planning on
moving our kind forward.

52:55.290 --> 52:58.920
Getting us access to worlds you
wouldn't dare dream about.

52:59.020 --> 53:00.860
I'm entitled, I have the right.

53:00.940 --> 53:02.830
All right.

53:02.930 --> 53:06.320
You fight that fight, naive little girl.

53:06.460 --> 53:09.620
Learn the lesson we
all learn eventually.

53:09.700 --> 53:11.639
When it comes to the life we lead,

53:11.640 --> 53:13.899
there comes a point where you must

53:13.900 --> 53:16.200
accept disappointment.

53:17.420 --> 53:20.110
Like I'm disappointed in this top coat.

53:24.050 --> 53:25.880
It's on the house.

53:28.990 --> 53:30.200
Matt?

53:31.860 --> 53:33.560
Our boss is in the Post again.

53:33.700 --> 53:35.760
He's a master of the publicity machine.

53:35.820 --> 53:37.816
It's so fucking awesome the
way he controls them all.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.860
- Do you read the Post?
- Everyone does.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.500
I read the Times, too. The Journal.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.330
Listen, if you want to sip Chardonnay

53:43.440 --> 53:45.180
in the Upper West Side with
a bunch of intellectuals

53:45.200 --> 53:46.480
from Columbia, get the Times.

53:46.580 --> 53:48.286
If you want to get invited
to the best parties,

53:48.310 --> 53:50.220
walk past the line at
Palladium, meet celebrities,

53:50.240 --> 53:52.080
get your name in the Post.

53:52.460 --> 53:53.700
What do you want?

53:54.900 --> 53:56.210
Well,

53:56.320 --> 53:59.280
I know it's pretty early
in my time here, but, uh,

53:59.390 --> 54:01.450
if you look at what I've
accomplished so far,

54:01.550 --> 54:04.360
I-I... I wrote that speech
for the Ellis Island award,

54:04.460 --> 54:05.679
- and, uh...
- What is this about?

54:05.680 --> 54:06.840
You want more money?

54:08.440 --> 54:11.030
Well, yes. I was hoping for a...

54:11.130 --> 54:13.460
maybe, like, a ten
percent bump, or-or a...

54:13.980 --> 54:16.200
preferably, a small bonus.

54:21.140 --> 54:22.820
Close the door.

54:29.720 --> 54:31.320
Have a seat.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.070
So what's she like?

54:52.170 --> 54:53.380
I want details.

54:53.410 --> 54:55.340
She blonde? Got big tits?

54:55.440 --> 54:57.170
She do that new Brazilian
thing down there?

54:58.360 --> 55:00.310
I... I don't...

55:00.410 --> 55:02.210
I'm sorry, I-I don't understand.

55:02.240 --> 55:04.150
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

55:04.250 --> 55:05.280
Huh?

55:05.380 --> 55:06.980
I'm proud of you. I'm telling you,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.800
you put on that suit, you
get behind that Cadillac,

55:08.820 --> 55:10.880
the pussy starts flowing
like Niagara Falls.

55:11.900 --> 55:13.800
My wife just wants a dishwasher.

55:16.260 --> 55:18.000
I'll get you your money.

55:18.260 --> 55:19.860
Two conditions.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.170
You work weekends when I ask,

55:22.270 --> 55:24.760
and you got to tell
me the fucking truth.

55:31.880 --> 55:33.180
She's beautiful.

55:33.280 --> 55:34.380
Yeah?

55:36.080 --> 55:37.350
Puerto Rican, I think.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.350
Exotic.

55:41.450 --> 55:44.220
It's not my thing, but to each his own.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.020
Do you love her?

55:47.240 --> 55:48.880
- I don't know yet.
- You don't.

55:48.940 --> 55:50.800
You're just not tired
of fucking her yet.

56:04.280 --> 56:05.520
Matt, thank you.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.900
I promise I will earn every penny.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.360
Word of advice.

56:10.150 --> 56:11.450
Don't leave your wife.

56:11.550 --> 56:14.280
And if you get her pregnant, you
come talk to me immediately.

56:32.100 --> 56:34.070
Jesus Christ, not this bitch again.

56:34.170 --> 56:35.960
Don't you have anything better to do?

56:35.980 --> 56:38.900
Told you, I'll be here every
night until you serve me.

56:38.960 --> 56:41.210
I'm not dealing with your shit tonight.

56:41.310 --> 56:42.696
- I'm calling the cops.
- Call them.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.620
I'll be right here. I'm
not afraid of Five-O.

56:53.330 --> 56:56.229
Have you noticed you're the only one

56:56.230 --> 56:58.160
here with the year-round tan?

56:58.260 --> 56:59.920
What's your point?

57:00.020 --> 57:01.300
They don't want us here.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.270
No, they don't want you here.

57:05.480 --> 57:07.040
Compliments of the house.

57:07.100 --> 57:08.800
Thank you.

57:09.110 --> 57:11.310
I still want my Manhattan.

57:11.460 --> 57:14.200
Miss, can I have a word with you?

57:14.210 --> 57:15.880
"Miss"? It's a dude.

57:15.980 --> 57:17.439
I am a woman

57:17.440 --> 57:20.060
and I will be addressed like a lady.

57:20.140 --> 57:22.060
Sir, can I have a quick word with you?

57:22.140 --> 57:24.100
What, is the battery in
your hearing aid dead?

57:24.180 --> 57:27.160
I said I'm a woman and I
go by "ma'am" or "miss."

57:27.260 --> 57:28.640
This is what I'm talking about, Officer.

57:28.660 --> 57:30.410
- He's constantly spouting off.
- You know what?

57:30.430 --> 57:32.416
Why don't you make like your
hairline and disappear?

57:32.440 --> 57:35.100
- You know, you need to calm down.
- Deaf and blind.

57:35.180 --> 57:36.736
You know what, I can't
arrest you for being here,

57:36.760 --> 57:38.416
- but I can arrest you for your mouth.
- What?

57:38.440 --> 57:40.486
That's right. You're under
arrest for disturbing the peace.

57:40.510 --> 57:43.970
Turn around.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.210
Get her out.

57:45.310 --> 57:48.250
All right, Officer.

57:52.080 --> 57:54.220
What the fuck are you looking at, bitch?

57:54.320 --> 57:55.720
I think it likes you.

57:56.420 --> 57:58.220
Man, fuck you.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.230
What's up? You pissed that her
dick is bigger than yours?

58:01.330 --> 58:03.680
Rodriguez.

58:03.840 --> 58:04.980
You made bail.

58:05.200 --> 58:07.440
Wait, somebody bailed me out?

58:08.940 --> 58:10.130
Who?

58:10.240 --> 58:12.760
That is Caron Poivre, darling.

58:13.540 --> 58:16.340
Mmm, I've never smelled a
perfume like that before.

58:16.440 --> 58:18.240
Well, of course you haven't.

58:18.340 --> 58:20.380
It cost $100 an ounce.

58:20.480 --> 58:22.450
I don't believe that the
ladies of the evening

58:22.550 --> 58:24.879
that come through here
or the girls in the bars

58:24.880 --> 58:26.339
you frequent in Newark

58:26.340 --> 58:29.720
can afford such a luxurious aroma.

58:32.440 --> 58:33.760
Elektra?

58:34.080 --> 58:36.560
Ah, there she is.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.080
This one is a relation
of my housekeeper.

58:40.100 --> 58:43.099
The poor woman was
inconsolable about her arrest,

58:43.100 --> 58:44.780
so I volunteered to be of assistance.

58:44.880 --> 58:47.100
And she's an expert with my delicates.

58:47.210 --> 58:48.700
How could I say no?

58:48.840 --> 58:50.920
A true pleasure, Officer.

58:51.180 --> 58:53.420
I do love a man in uniform.

58:53.500 --> 58:55.199
Perhaps I'll call on you one evening

58:55.200 --> 58:57.560
if I'm in the neighborhood
and in need of some company.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.660
Any time, sweetheart.

59:05.360 --> 59:06.860
Let's go.

59:07.020 --> 59:08.990
Well, this is a surprise.

59:09.090 --> 59:10.319
You're lucky that I
have a gentleman friend

59:10.320 --> 59:12.900
who understands my needs in
terms of walking-around money.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.240
Though don't expect the same
kindness in the future.

59:15.270 --> 59:16.920
You just cost me half
my weekly allowance,

59:17.000 --> 59:18.279
and it's only fucking Tuesday.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.270
Yeah, but why? Why did you help me out?

59:20.370 --> 59:21.660
Why do you think?

59:21.760 --> 59:22.960
There's my car.

59:23.020 --> 59:24.979
Because you understand
what I'm trying to do

59:24.980 --> 59:26.280
by getting into this bar.

59:27.720 --> 59:29.280
Have you lost your mind?

59:29.380 --> 59:31.960
Did you not see me back
there with that policeman?

59:32.220 --> 59:34.640
I can gain access to any
bar or country club

59:34.680 --> 59:36.350
or department store in this city.

59:36.420 --> 59:38.480
Your struggle is not my struggle.

59:38.620 --> 59:40.570
My struggle is that I was defeated

59:40.580 --> 59:41.619
at the balls last weekend.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.880
Because you're so distracted
with this silliness,

59:43.940 --> 59:46.300
I have remained in a
temporary humiliation.

59:46.400 --> 59:49.200
You are not being beaten
within an inch of your life

59:49.300 --> 59:51.980
in that jail because I need you
to be at the ball tomorrow night

59:52.020 --> 59:53.680
so I can reclaim my honor.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.860
And you will be there, bitch.

59:56.900 --> 59:58.700
So that's all that matters to you?

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.310
That is our place.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:03.920
Our community.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.120
The balls were created so we
would have somewhere to matter.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.220
If you have any aspirations
to become a legendary mother,

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.880
you'll get it in your skull that
while there are many places

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.430
for us to find love and
adoration in the outside world,

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.739
in this life, yes,

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.220
the balls are all that matters.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.740
Is your driver going uptown?

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.919
Yes.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.080
Subway's two blocks away.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.820
Hey, I heard you was here.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.590
Can we talk?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.560
Can we talk?

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.930
I heard you the first time.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.160
What you want?

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.140
I want to start over.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.300
You clearly didn't
appreciate my presence.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.950
My absence shouldn't be any different.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:18.879
That's not true. Look,

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.220
I like you

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.880
and I'd like to invite you out,

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.460
but it's not a date, just
two friends hanging out.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.220
Tuesday night?

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:28.760
I'm busy.

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.980
Fine. Wednesday night?

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.500
I have tickets to the ballet.

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.720
The ballet?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.580
Hell nah.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.300
I thought the same thing,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.080
but I went and...

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.700
it opened me up.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:53.740
The freedom I saw on that stage!

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.360
I mean, those dancers weren't
dancing with the music.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.600
They were the music.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.040
Not interested.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:07.590
I thought you wanted a
different kind of life.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.339
I mean, maybe

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.440
this is the beginning of something new.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.120
Look, I'll be in front
of the Roosevelt Hall

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.160
Wednesday at 6:30.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.660
Attire's kind of fancy, so
no jeans or shell tops,

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.440
in case you decide to show up.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.320
The category is...

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.770
Femme Queen in Pumps.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.980
Now, this is not a face category.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.850
This is to show that you
can cross the threshold

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.060
into the Four Seasons

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:11.320
or to the bar at the St. Regis

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.960
or tip up and down Fifth Avenue

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.580
and never stumble,

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.580
wobble or show fear.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.260
Miss Kiki Pendavis,
your heels are too low

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.240
and your hips have no flow.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.599
Please remove yourself from the premises

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.919
and do not return

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.000
until you're in some goddamn stilts

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.919
because as we all know,

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.780
six inches is the minimum.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.400
Ladies and gentlemen, clear
the floor. Clear the floor.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.770
I need the floor cleared
of all contestants.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.459
I have just gotten word

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.660
that it is time for a rematch

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.220
between the legendary House of Abundance

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.940
and the upstart House of Evangelista.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.200
Now, if my memory serves me correct,

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.750
each has one win.

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:23.820
Who will be the best out of three?

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:26.960
Ah, here she comes,

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.299
freshly sprung

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.820
from her night in the clink.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:33.760
Yes, you do belong, darling,

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.800
walking like you were
born in a stiletto.

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.870
What have we here?

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.950
Is it Aphrodite?

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:51.260
Is it the goddess Athena?

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.830
Who are we to stand

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:10.480
in this woman's presence?

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.339
How could we possibly

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.340
deserve to bear witness

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.579
to all that the

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.580
goddess Elektra is bringing forth

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.679
on this evening?

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.059
There is no way this bitch

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.420
is getting her heel stuck in a grate.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.560
Judges, please, it's time to score.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.779
For Miss Blanca,

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.020
ten, ten, nine, nine.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.320
A respectable score.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.930
And now, for the legend Elektra,

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:41.700
ten, ten, ten, ten.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.900
Perfection.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.480
Grand prize, Elektra.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.770
First runner-up, Miss Blanca.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.910
Elektra! Elektra! Elektra!

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.460
Elektra! Elektra! Elektra!

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.690
Elektra! Elektra! Elektra!

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.320
You know what it is?

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.710
- No.
- You don't?

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:20.910
- No.
- Can you see?

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.910
No.

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:24.980
Where are we going?

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.620
On the count of three, okay?

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.280
- Okay.
- Three.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, babe.
