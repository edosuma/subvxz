00:23.604 --> 00:25.125
Hey, roomie, you decent yet?

00:25.962 --> 00:27.091
I guess.

00:27.141 --> 00:28.569
You like it black, right?

00:28.923 --> 00:29.829
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.263
Mm-hmm.

00:34.662 --> 00:36.238
Mmm. You don't like it.

00:36.288 --> 00:38.337
No, it's-it's perfect.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.872
Yeah, I woke up this morning so excited.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.441
This place is so sweet. You are so sweet.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.509
Thank you.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.144
You're the one that did me the favor.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.580
Like I said, I really
don't think I should be
alone right now, so...

00:48.781 --> 00:50.116
Uh, okay.

01:02.661 --> 01:03.493
What's that?

01:03.543 --> 01:04.796
Uh, it's, uh, Vallenwe'en...

01:04.831 --> 01:06.231
Dawn's guinea pig.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.100
Dawn's rodents moved in, too?

01:08.134 --> 01:09.567
I promised her I'd take care of it

01:09.602 --> 01:11.369
while she's at
the cardiovascular conference.

01:11.437 --> 01:13.412
You know how she worries.

01:13.515 --> 01:17.008
What exactly is our house policy on pets?

01:17.042 --> 01:18.743
Zero tolerance.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.779
Unless it's a Nova Scotia
Duck Tolling Retriever.

01:21.847 --> 01:24.048
A what exactly?

01:29.522 --> 01:31.523
Hey, Charlie, how's it going?

01:31.590 --> 01:33.924
Uh good.

01:33.992 --> 01:35.359
Wow.

01:35.393 --> 01:37.662
You should take lessons
to learn how to lie, seriously.

01:38.587 --> 01:40.409
I'm not a chick, Mel, so
just say what you're gonna say,

01:40.459 --> 01:41.708
say it quick.

01:41.878 --> 01:43.034
You proposed to Alex.

01:44.369 --> 01:45.636
Yeah.

01:45.704 --> 01:47.271
She's been through a lot.

01:47.338 --> 01:49.806
Just give her some time. She'll come around.

01:49.874 --> 01:51.975
What if she's gone for good?

01:52.043 --> 01:53.777
Not gone. On your 6:00.

01:53.844 --> 01:54.811
What?

01:54.879 --> 01:56.180
Behind you.

01:57.715 --> 01:59.916
Hey.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.018
- Charlie.
- Good morning.

02:02.086 --> 02:04.020
Good morning.
How are the new roommates doing?

02:04.955 --> 02:06.890
Great.

02:06.924 --> 02:11.227
I have to go bathe Vallenwe'en
before Dawn gets back.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.595
Check you later, roomie.

02:14.565 --> 02:18.101
If you must know, a little
too perky for the morning.

02:18.135 --> 02:20.136
And I hate being called roomie.

02:21.463 --> 02:24.940
Uh, I, um, actually
dug up some of my old keys.

02:25.008 --> 02:26.875
Thank you, and I found a box of your...

02:32.048 --> 02:34.283
Déjà vu?

02:34.318 --> 02:36.819
It's just... I'm over-caffeinated.

02:36.853 --> 02:38.354
Maggie brews a wicked cup.

02:39.689 --> 02:43.025
Uh, you managed to find a box of...?

02:43.059 --> 02:45.027
Yeah, some old photos and things you forgot.

02:45.061 --> 02:46.628
I thought maybe I'd bring them for you.

02:46.662 --> 02:47.629
There's no rush.

02:47.663 --> 02:49.264
Okay.

02:49.298 --> 02:51.466
Well, I should, uh, get to the E.R.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.968
Why don't I meet you in the, uh...

02:53.002 --> 02:54.103
Yes.

02:57.172 --> 02:59.040
Yeah, you should have come in
as soon as you were bit,

02:59.108 --> 03:00.141
not wait a day.

03:00.209 --> 03:02.043
I know. I-I thought I had it covered.

03:02.077 --> 03:04.145
- Geez.
- It bit me in my own backyard.

03:04.179 --> 03:05.680
What exactly is it that bit you?

03:05.715 --> 03:08.049
M-massasauga rattler, I think.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.252
Oh!

03:10.286 --> 03:11.419
Geez.

03:11.454 --> 03:13.087
Pretty nervy of you to wrangle that, huh?

03:13.122 --> 03:15.322
Yeah, I guess so.
I've dealt with snakes before.

03:15.357 --> 03:18.059
I camped up and down the Appalachian Trail.

03:18.093 --> 03:19.526
You know, there's some mothers out there

03:19.561 --> 03:20.783
you don't want to mess with.

03:22.700 --> 03:23.888
Well, I don't want to mess
with any of those mothers.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.134
Are you sure that cat cage is locked tight?

03:26.184 --> 03:27.422
Oh, yeah. No worries.

03:27.472 --> 03:29.303
Okay, this may sting a bit, okay?

03:30.238 --> 03:31.405
Oh!

03:32.394 --> 03:35.532
My, Zach, what a great, big snake you have.

03:35.582 --> 03:36.791
He was bit.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.579
Whoa! I can see that.

03:38.613 --> 03:41.248
Yeah, I tried to dig the venom out myself.

03:41.283 --> 03:42.549
Yeah, I see that, too.

03:42.584 --> 03:43.387
Why don't you

03:43.437 --> 03:45.939
leave that to the professional
butchers next time, okay?

03:45.989 --> 03:47.051
Mm-hmm.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.890
Well, the swelling's relatively
small, looks contained.

03:49.957 --> 03:51.324
I'm just gonna mark this

03:51.392 --> 03:54.127
and see how you respond to
the anti-venom, all right?

03:54.162 --> 03:55.962
It's not my first hit of anti-venom.

03:55.997 --> 03:58.830
I, uh... I got one last summer stateside

03:58.880 --> 04:01.491
- for a cottonmouth bite.
- Mm-hmm.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.920
You think you maybe
want to up the dosage?

04:03.970 --> 04:05.538
Jackson!

04:06.740 --> 04:08.441
I need another vial of anti-venom.

04:08.475 --> 04:10.860
And run an I.V., antibiotics,
and some steroids, too.

04:10.910 --> 04:11.978
Sweet.

04:12.053 --> 04:12.945
Massasauga rattler?

04:13.013 --> 04:15.415
Yeah. You... you know about snakes?

04:15.449 --> 04:17.716
I got an amazonian boa
that's the ruler of my house.

04:17.785 --> 04:19.151
Okay, well, let's just call animal control

04:19.219 --> 04:20.752
and get them to come down here
and take it away,

04:20.821 --> 04:22.473
the sooner, the better, okay?

04:22.523 --> 04:23.671
Why? Are you scared?

04:24.123 --> 04:24.997
Possibly.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.926
- Here you go.
- Hey, hey. Jackson, don't...

04:28.995 --> 04:30.562
They're probably just gonna kill it, right?

04:30.596 --> 04:31.663
Works for me.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.900
Are you feeling any dizziness
from the car crash, Will?

04:35.968 --> 04:37.302
What is that?

04:37.370 --> 04:40.572
Well, I need to see if
there's bleeding in your belly.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.873
And the good news is...

04:41.941 --> 04:43.442
there isn't.

04:43.509 --> 04:47.312
So, were you driving
the car when it crashed?

04:47.380 --> 04:49.848
Yes. I have a learner's license.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.582
Ah.

04:51.650 --> 04:54.618
Do you know where you are when
everything is coming your way?

04:54.686 --> 04:55.619
Sorry?

04:55.687 --> 04:56.955
The wrong lane.

04:58.523 --> 05:02.693
Is my mom going to be okay?

05:02.761 --> 05:05.596
I'll go check for you
as soon as we're done, okay?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.770
Did you hurt your hand?

05:12.804 --> 05:15.272
No. I'm fine.

05:15.340 --> 05:16.874
And so are you.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.843
See you in a few minutes.

05:20.211 --> 05:21.679
Hey, guys. What do we have?

05:21.747 --> 05:24.447
We've got a 54-year-old female
injured in a car accident,

05:24.482 --> 05:27.317
blunt trauma to the abdominal
region and also to the spine.

05:27.385 --> 05:28.651
My son?

05:28.719 --> 05:30.720
Why don't you let us
worry about that, ma'am?

05:30.755 --> 05:32.856
But your arms... can you feel those, ma'am?

05:32.891 --> 05:34.124
Where? Where's Will?

05:36.895 --> 05:38.262
Potential organ injuries, yes.

05:38.329 --> 05:39.429
Okay.

05:39.497 --> 05:40.663
She's tanking.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.365
Could somebody get me a crash cart, please?

05:42.433 --> 05:44.934
And I need a pail of uncross-matched
blood right away, please!

05:44.968 --> 05:46.335
What can I do?

05:46.370 --> 05:48.170
Take over compressions.
Just be careful of that spine.

05:48.205 --> 05:50.106
Well, do you want her to walk,
or do you want her to live?

05:50.140 --> 05:51.173
Well, preferably both.

05:51.241 --> 05:53.242
- Mom! Mom, wait!
- It's okay, buddy.

05:53.277 --> 05:55.378
Charlie, can you help him, please?

05:55.413 --> 05:56.312
Yep. Got it, got it.

05:56.346 --> 05:57.479
- Ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

05:57.547 --> 05:59.515
- Clear.
- Stop!

05:59.549 --> 06:01.583
- You're hurting my mom!
- No, they're not hurting her.

06:01.618 --> 06:03.552
- - We've got a rhythm.
Okay, let's get her to the O.R.

06:03.586 --> 06:04.987
Mom! Stop!

06:05.022 --> 06:07.723
She's gonna be okay. Just... just calm down.

06:07.757 --> 06:09.926
- No!
- I'm right beside you.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.761
Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's your name?

06:12.796 --> 06:14.296
- Can you tell me your name?
- Get out of my way!

06:14.330 --> 06:15.864
I'm right here, Will.

06:15.899 --> 06:17.633
♪ everybody happy ♪

06:17.667 --> 06:19.034
♪ nobody sad ♪

06:19.068 --> 06:21.202
♪ well, I should say, hey, hey ♪

06:21.237 --> 06:23.439
I said, let me see my mom!

06:23.473 --> 06:25.173
Hey, hey, will. Will, is it? Hey.

06:25.207 --> 06:26.775
♪ everybody happy ♪

06:26.810 --> 06:28.076
♪ nobody sad ♪

06:28.110 --> 06:30.946

06:30.980 --> 06:32.314
How do you know that?

06:32.348 --> 06:33.781
Do you know my mom?

06:33.816 --> 06:36.051
Uh, yeah.

06:36.085 --> 06:37.518
Uh, kind of.

06:37.553 --> 06:39.454
You can talk to her?

06:39.488 --> 06:41.122
Yep.

06:46.128 --> 06:49.864
Tell her I'm sorry!

06:54.090 --> 06:56.764
Studying for the surgical boards
is no joke, Maggie.

06:56.831 --> 06:58.666
if we fail them, we've wasted about
10 years of our life.

06:58.700 --> 06:59.867
I know, I know.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.902
But when Lana asked me, I couldn't say no.

07:01.936 --> 07:04.070
She has this pathetic, dying-puppy-dog look.

07:04.104 --> 07:06.105
Okay, great. So lazy Lana's
part of our study group.

07:06.174 --> 07:07.274
Are you gonna carry her?

07:07.308 --> 07:08.775
I swear it won't happen again, okay?

07:08.842 --> 07:10.510
I will kill all pity...

07:10.545 --> 07:12.520
Ladies, can we just focus
for a second of our lives, please?

07:12.686 --> 07:13.328
Right.

07:13.378 --> 07:15.221
The priority is to stop
the abdominal bleeding,

07:15.271 --> 07:16.805
and we need to be ready to crack the chest

07:16.855 --> 07:17.806
if it looks torrential.

07:17.856 --> 07:18.851
The patient has had a spinal trauma,

07:18.919 --> 07:20.452
so let's be careful
not to aggravate that cord.

07:20.487 --> 07:22.055
- You got that, Lin?
- Got it.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.123
Hey, what kind of snacks do you want
to serve at our first meeting?

07:24.191 --> 07:25.725
- Unbelievable.
- First meeting?

07:25.759 --> 07:28.127
First meeting. Tonight.
Our place. Study group.

07:28.195 --> 07:29.662
Thought we talked about it, roomie.

07:33.734 --> 07:36.068
Roomie is not a happy roomie.

07:36.102 --> 07:38.704
A gloomy roomie.

07:38.738 --> 07:40.472
- Am I dead?
- Ah...

07:40.540 --> 07:41.807
- Am I?
- No.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.242
Then what am I?

07:43.276 --> 07:45.143
I-I don't know. I really wish I did.

07:45.178 --> 07:47.546
I can't die. My son needs me.

07:47.581 --> 07:49.848
What do you think
will happen to him without me?

07:49.916 --> 07:51.317
Do you see a line out there

07:51.384 --> 07:53.719
of people happy to look after
an adult with Downs?

07:53.786 --> 07:55.921
- They're doing the best they can.
- No, not good enough.

07:55.988 --> 07:57.956
I told you, I can't die. It's nonnegotiable.

07:58.024 --> 07:59.357
Do you always talk
to strangers this way or...?

07:59.425 --> 08:00.525
No, just you.

08:00.593 --> 08:02.293
And when it comes to protecting my son.

08:02.361 --> 08:04.796
And trust me, I will.

08:06.632 --> 08:08.566
Oh, don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

08:08.634 --> 08:11.936
They usually eat mice,
voles, even other snakes.

08:11.970 --> 08:13.571
I'm kind of scared.

08:13.639 --> 08:16.341
Hey, I won't let it bite you.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.776
What is gonna happen to my mom?

08:18.844 --> 08:20.978
She's in very good hands, bro... the best.

08:21.046 --> 08:22.347
- Can I see her?
- Uh, no.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.914
No, not, uh, not quite yet.

08:23.949 --> 08:25.549
Can we get rid of that thing?

08:25.617 --> 08:26.583
I'm on shift.

08:26.618 --> 08:28.619
Get the new guy to deal with it.

08:28.686 --> 08:30.788
Dr. Larouche!

08:32.557 --> 08:34.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no.

08:34.363 --> 08:36.827
- Let's grab a seat, Will.
- No, I need to stay right here.

08:36.895 --> 08:39.230
He's afraid. Hug him.

08:40.498 --> 08:42.799
I said hug him.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.508
That is from your mom.

08:52.810 --> 08:53.877
Thanks, mom.

08:53.911 --> 08:56.813
From now on, just do what I tell you.

08:56.847 --> 09:01.184
Did you tell her I was sorry
for the car crash?

09:01.218 --> 09:02.551
Oh, god, Will.

09:02.586 --> 09:04.788
Tell him the accident was my fault.

09:04.822 --> 09:07.857
I was so nervous, I made him nervous, too.

09:07.892 --> 09:09.659
Are you listening to me, doctor?

09:09.693 --> 09:11.027
We got trouble!

09:17.133 --> 09:18.601
This just started?

09:18.635 --> 09:20.436
Yeah, along with
a spike in body temperature.

09:20.470 --> 09:21.671
So the anti-venom isn't working?

09:21.705 --> 09:23.172
You ever seen anything like this before?

09:23.206 --> 09:24.440
From that snake? No way.

09:27.277 --> 09:29.512
Blood clots are spreading all over his body.

09:29.546 --> 09:30.913
Why the hell isn't the anti-venom working?

09:30.947 --> 09:32.514
Sure that's the snake that bit him?

09:32.548 --> 09:33.782
Why would he lie about it?

09:33.817 --> 09:35.217
I don't know. Crazy if he did.

09:35.251 --> 09:36.952
It could be allergic reaction.

09:36.986 --> 09:38.375
Let's run some more blood tests
and push more steroids.

09:38.425 --> 09:39.453
Yeah, I'm on it.

09:39.488 --> 09:41.824
- He's going into shock.
- Here. See if you can track down his family.

09:41.858 --> 09:43.692
Okay.

09:44.660 --> 09:46.864
Abdomen's full of blood.
How does the chest wall look?

09:46.914 --> 09:48.330
Ribs don't appear
to have punctured the lung.

09:48.364 --> 09:50.332
- A little help here, Joel?
- You got it.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.667
Okay, am I giving you
enough space there, Dr. Reid?

09:52.702 --> 09:54.369
Yeah. Just enough. Thank you.

09:54.403 --> 09:55.837
Clamp, please.

09:55.871 --> 09:58.373
Okay. All right.

09:58.407 --> 10:01.376
I am clamping everything here.
I'm doing a pringle maneuver.

10:01.410 --> 10:02.995
Can't see much.
How's the liver look?

10:03.067 --> 10:05.012
- Brutal.
- Is that the technical term?

10:05.047 --> 10:07.315
Sponges. Keep them coming, please.

10:07.349 --> 10:09.717
Her liver's been pulped.
I don't think it's viable.

10:09.751 --> 10:12.453
Both the right and left lobes
have been severely damaged.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.388
Okay, let's pack it, and then
let's get her into imaging

10:14.456 --> 10:16.083
and see how badly damaged
that spinal cord is.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.591
- Right.
- How do you want to tell her son?

10:17.625 --> 10:18.792
What do you mean?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.094
He's got Down syndrome, Joel.

10:20.128 --> 10:22.028
Somebody has to try
to explain all of this to him.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.364
Okay, so we explain it to him.

10:23.398 --> 10:25.031
You remember, I have a cousin with Downs.

10:25.066 --> 10:28.669
He'll be fine. We'll just
do it together, okay?

10:29.771 --> 10:31.938
Thank you.

10:34.476 --> 10:36.844
Hey, Lin, um,

10:36.878 --> 10:38.544
I hear you have a study group
going for the boards.

10:38.612 --> 10:40.413
Mm-hmm. Yep, and it's all full.

10:40.447 --> 10:41.982
Oh, come on. You gonna let lazy Lana in?

10:42.049 --> 10:43.316
You know she's just gonna coast.

10:44.351 --> 10:45.752
Is that what my nickname means?

10:45.786 --> 10:47.320
Seriously?

10:47.388 --> 10:49.856
I always thought it was because of my eye.

10:49.891 --> 10:53.326
It's just this weird hereditary thing.

10:55.262 --> 10:57.329
Uh, you're gonna have to ask Alex.

10:57.398 --> 10:59.298
She's study group boss, not me.

10:59.366 --> 11:02.067
The old surgical board study group, huh?

11:02.135 --> 11:03.436
You hold hands and pray?

11:03.470 --> 11:05.337
"Jesus, please let me be a surgeon."

11:05.406 --> 11:07.473
Don't knock the power of prayer. You passed.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.910
You, uh, bring a cat in here
in that cage, hot shot?

11:12.349 --> 11:14.206
Sort of just holding it for...
for a patient.

11:14.256 --> 11:16.848
Well, the door's open.
Good luck finding kitty.

11:18.985 --> 11:21.253
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:21.321 --> 11:22.587
Maggie, it's gone.

11:22.655 --> 11:23.555
What's gone?

11:23.589 --> 11:24.924
I didn't see a cat in there.

11:24.991 --> 11:26.591
I did see a big snake, though.

11:29.910 --> 11:33.097
So, she said she couldn't feel
her arms, but the CT's normal.

11:33.165 --> 11:36.167
Need an MRI, see if
that spinal cord is damaged.

11:36.235 --> 11:37.903
Oh, she'll be lucky to make it that far.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.638
I could only salvage about 15% of her liver,

11:39.672 --> 11:40.639
and that's failing.

11:40.673 --> 11:42.307
Emergency transplant?

11:42.341 --> 11:44.108
Yeah, I put her on priority 4 status,

11:44.176 --> 11:46.044
but that transplant's
got to come through today or...

11:46.111 --> 11:47.578
Good news...

11:47.612 --> 11:48.947
All around.

11:48.981 --> 11:51.215
Yeah, well, now we've got to tell her son

11:51.250 --> 11:52.984
that mom's on death's door.

11:54.619 --> 11:57.788
Hey, what's going on?

11:57.856 --> 11:59.390
What are you afraid of here?

11:59.425 --> 12:02.392
Honestly, seems like just
about everything right now.

12:02.427 --> 12:06.296
Even the easy things are hard.

12:06.331 --> 12:09.567
It's going to get better.

12:09.601 --> 12:12.536
Well, I'll have to trust your word.

12:12.571 --> 12:16.706
You should. My word is excellent.

12:16.774 --> 12:20.344
Jackson left it in the cage.
He must have left it unlocked.

12:20.378 --> 12:23.413
You're telling me the snake
that causes eyes to bleed

12:23.481 --> 12:24.781
is loose in my hospital?

12:24.815 --> 12:28.118
Alert security, call a hospital-wide code,

12:28.152 --> 12:29.886
- and, you two, find the damn thing now.
- Uh...

12:29.920 --> 12:31.455
but why me?

12:31.489 --> 12:32.689
I had nothing to do with this.

12:32.723 --> 12:34.323
I don't care. I hate snakes. They're evil.

12:34.358 --> 12:35.892
Okay, what code do we call?

12:35.926 --> 12:37.861
Brown. Code brown.

12:37.895 --> 12:40.229
Isn't that hazardous spills?

12:40.263 --> 12:41.631
Close enough. Just do it!

12:42.900 --> 12:44.501
Thanks a lot.

12:50.340 --> 12:51.974
Sorry to intrude.

12:52.009 --> 12:54.143
Hey.

12:54.177 --> 12:56.312
Hey. Hello, Will.

12:57.814 --> 13:00.116
How's, uh... how's his mom doing?

13:04.354 --> 13:07.188
Um, Will, I have to get to the E.R.

13:07.223 --> 13:08.724
My mom needs you.

13:08.791 --> 13:10.291
I know. I'll be back as soon as I can.

13:13.530 --> 13:16.064
He talks to my mom for me.

13:16.098 --> 13:19.868
Yeah, actually, we wanted to
have a conversation with you

13:19.903 --> 13:21.670
about your mother, too, Will,

13:21.738 --> 13:25.040
sort of to explain what's gonna happen next.

13:25.107 --> 13:26.607
- Will she die?
- Well, we hope not,

13:26.642 --> 13:29.044
but you have to understand,
she's very sick right now.

13:29.078 --> 13:31.413
Do you understand that, Will?

13:35.084 --> 13:37.485
We were in a parking lot

13:37.553 --> 13:40.254
where it was safe to drive.

13:40.288 --> 13:43.157
What happened?

13:43.191 --> 13:46.393
I hit the gas,

13:46.461 --> 13:49.730
not the brake.

13:49.798 --> 13:52.733
The truck hit her side.

14:02.510 --> 14:05.179
Your mom needs a liver transplant, Will.

14:05.246 --> 14:07.281
We put her on the list today,

14:07.348 --> 14:10.084
and we're waiting for one to come through.

14:10.151 --> 14:12.052
From where?

14:12.119 --> 14:14.487
Accident victims,
people that sign donor cards.

14:14.555 --> 14:19.092
Someone has to die so my mom gets better?

14:19.159 --> 14:21.260
Well, we also do living transplants,

14:21.328 --> 14:24.564
where, um, a donor can give part
of their own healthy liver,

14:24.632 --> 14:26.600
but that's not likely in your mom's case.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.834
Why?

14:27.902 --> 14:30.002
'Cause it would have to be today.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.670
You know, as a family member,

14:31.738 --> 14:34.039
you're very likely to be a match, Will.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.808
You're saying I could save my mom?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.177
If the tests prove that
you're the right candidate,

14:38.245 --> 14:39.178
it could work.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.246
Let me do it!

14:40.280 --> 14:42.881
Just hold on a minute, okay?

14:42.916 --> 14:45.283
We don't have a minute.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.785
This is great, Will.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.621
We'll run tests.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.922
Joel.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.891
You should have discussed this with me.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.259
You're giving him false hope.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.928
No, we are the only hope that he has.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.196
Listen to me, Alex.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.233
She'll die before you find another donor.

15:11.860 --> 15:12.831
Stop him.

15:12.898 --> 15:14.633
I can't let Will be my organ donor.

15:14.667 --> 15:15.767
It's too dangerous.

15:15.802 --> 15:17.068
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:17.102 --> 15:19.003
They want him to risk
his life for me.

15:19.038 --> 15:20.271
I can't do this right now.

15:20.340 --> 15:22.040
What... what kind of a doctor are you?

15:22.074 --> 15:23.842
Oh, right, the normal, arrogant kind.

15:23.876 --> 15:25.877
Help him, damn it.

15:25.911 --> 15:28.479
Protect him. You can't let him do this!

15:28.513 --> 15:30.715
Get this... patient's an illegal smuggler.

15:30.749 --> 15:32.383
He brings in exotic species,

15:32.417 --> 15:34.118
sells them in the underground market.

15:34.153 --> 15:36.254
That's why he lied
about the snake that bit him.

15:36.288 --> 15:37.922
Yeah. He could go to jail for this.

15:37.957 --> 15:40.090
Long time, too. He's protecting his ass.

15:40.124 --> 15:43.126
Well, he's gonna lose a lot more
than that unless we get lucky.

15:43.161 --> 15:45.563
Check this. I think this one did the deed.

15:45.597 --> 15:47.170
South african twig snake.

15:47.220 --> 15:49.682
Symptoms match, especially the bleeding out.

15:49.744 --> 15:51.689
There's no anti-venom available.

15:51.898 --> 15:53.731
Is Dr. Bell back from her conference yet?

15:53.781 --> 15:54.439
Haven't heard.

15:54.489 --> 15:56.222
Page her or another cardiac surgeon.

15:56.273 --> 15:57.402
We're gonna need to get him to the ICU

15:57.452 --> 15:59.238
and activate the massive
transfusion protocol.

15:59.288 --> 16:00.505
Hail Mary it is.

16:00.555 --> 16:01.979
Um...

16:03.453 --> 16:04.907
Did you find the next of kin on his phone?

16:04.957 --> 16:07.435
- Yeah, just an ex-wife. Called her.
- Well, call her again.

16:07.485 --> 16:09.207
She's gonna want to be here.

16:10.986 --> 16:13.133
A Down syndrome living organ donor.

16:13.183 --> 16:14.262
Did I hear that last part correctly?

16:14.312 --> 16:15.859
He's an adult,
and his mother is our patient.

16:15.893 --> 16:18.749
Will's a match, and we have the
transplant team ready to go.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.267
Are you really that naive?

16:20.317 --> 16:21.448
- I mean, it's charming, but really?
- Dawn,

16:21.498 --> 16:23.360
- no. Please.
- No, you know what?

16:23.410 --> 16:24.701
Educate me, please, but do make it quick,

16:24.735 --> 16:26.235
because our patient's on a clock.

16:26.303 --> 16:28.355
Okay. Well, first you need to get the donor

16:28.405 --> 16:30.903
into a capacity exam to see
if he's even competent

16:30.953 --> 16:32.108
to make the decision.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.598
Then a tribunal has to rule,

16:34.648 --> 16:36.662
acting as the Down syndrome's
legal guardian.

16:36.712 --> 16:38.552
Is that fast enough for you?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.502
Look at Will's test results.

16:40.772 --> 16:42.591
His blood's a match... "O."

16:42.641 --> 16:46.062
Ultrasound, echocardiogram,
even the volumetric CT.

16:46.142 --> 16:47.556
He is a match. We can save her life.

16:47.624 --> 16:49.346
I'm gonna get the ball rolling
with the tribunal,

16:49.396 --> 16:51.541
and I'll explain the process to Will.

16:51.963 --> 16:54.450
Page a shrink. Get a psych exam set up.

16:54.673 --> 16:55.428
Thank you.

16:55.478 --> 16:57.834
You gonna thank me if the kid dies?

17:04.744 --> 17:07.018
Dr. Lin, Dr. Larouche.

17:07.512 --> 17:08.707
What are you doing?

17:08.757 --> 17:12.270
- Us? Nothing. Why?
- Just hanging out.

17:13.064 --> 17:14.156
Okay.

17:14.916 --> 17:16.134
Maggie, I was just in my office,

17:16.184 --> 17:18.303
and Vallenwe'en is not in her cage.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.089
Uh, yeah, I left her in her
carrier in the call room.

17:22.634 --> 17:24.352
You know she doesn't like the call room.

17:24.402 --> 17:25.604
She likes her home.

17:25.654 --> 17:27.963
Please bring her back to my office.

17:28.550 --> 17:29.697
And put a sweater on her. It's chilly.

17:31.199 --> 17:34.177
Attention, E.R. staff,
code brown in effect.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.934
Code brown. What's that? Hazardous spills?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.439
What is the doctor gonna ask me?

17:43.489 --> 17:45.461
Well, why you want to help your mom,

17:45.511 --> 17:47.647
if you understand the risks
involved in a transplant surgery,

17:47.682 --> 17:49.883
probably questions
about your living situation.

17:49.951 --> 17:51.618
That's a lot of questions.

17:51.686 --> 17:53.920
Just be yourself. You'll be fine.

17:54.697 --> 17:56.618
- Dr. Day.
- Jimmy.

17:56.668 --> 17:58.394
Alex Reid. This is Will McCall.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.308
Come on in, William.

17:59.358 --> 18:01.887
I've just been reading your file.

18:03.163 --> 18:04.163
Great.

18:04.198 --> 18:06.165
Um, I prefer to do this alone,

18:06.200 --> 18:08.501
but thanks for bringing him by, Alex.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.238
God, I miss Gavin.

18:12.306 --> 18:13.873
Code brown in effect.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.608
What are you gonna do with forceps?

18:15.675 --> 18:17.773
Deliver the little baby snakes?

18:17.823 --> 18:19.211
How were you gonna pick it up?

18:19.261 --> 18:20.937
I am not going to pick it up.

18:20.987 --> 18:22.231
We are gonna find it...

18:22.281 --> 18:24.608
and then call security or Jackson.

18:24.658 --> 18:28.080
Okay, we is history,
'cause I got to go to the O.R.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.732
No, no, no, no. You can't do this to me.
Don't make me do this alone.

18:30.782 --> 18:31.857
P...

18:32.428 --> 18:35.134
You're so never getting
into our study group!

18:40.620 --> 18:42.811
He's bleeding out
because of a toxic snake bite,

18:42.861 --> 18:45.357
going septic, and no
anti-venom's gonna work.

18:45.407 --> 18:47.489
He needs a full exchange transfusion.

18:47.539 --> 18:49.638
I should've stayed another day
at my conference,

18:49.688 --> 18:51.363
but I was falling asleep to Reilly's paper

18:51.413 --> 18:53.651
on adrenal denervation
of idiopathic hypertension.

18:53.701 --> 18:55.588
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Right?

18:55.913 --> 18:57.630
You paged me, Dr. Bell?

18:57.842 --> 18:59.644
Yes. You're gonna be our blood bank runner.

18:59.694 --> 19:01.661
Two units, type "A" to start. Go.

19:01.910 --> 19:03.019
Hey, Dr. Harris, um,

19:03.069 --> 19:04.422
there's this surgical board study group.

19:04.456 --> 19:07.714
Um, I'd appreciate any advice

19:07.764 --> 19:09.655
that you'd have so Dr. Reid would let me in.

19:09.705 --> 19:10.725
Does this look like a good time?

19:10.775 --> 19:11.770
I-I apologize, sir.

19:11.820 --> 19:15.199
I'm really... I'm really, really
desperate right now.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.619
Okay, um, Dr. Reid doesn't fall for flash,

19:17.669 --> 19:20.021
- so show her you got the goods, okay?
- Yeah.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.321
- Now run!
- Thank you.

19:23.975 --> 19:26.416
Most of the risks in a living transplant

19:26.466 --> 19:27.677
are on the donor's part.

19:27.727 --> 19:29.944
It's a long, hazardous road back to health

19:29.994 --> 19:31.327
even if you don't have Downs.

19:31.377 --> 19:33.703
Are there any risks specific
to people with Down syndrome?

19:33.753 --> 19:35.218
Anesthetic can be problematic.

19:35.268 --> 19:38.800
Look, I'm sorry.
I talked to Will for an hour.

19:38.850 --> 19:40.729
I don't believe he's competent

19:40.779 --> 19:42.382
to give his consent for this surgery.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.307
What are you talking about?
He volunteered to do it.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.948
Actually, Dr. Goran, Will told
me that the plan came from you.

19:49.284 --> 19:50.481
Uh, is this true?

19:50.531 --> 19:52.884
- I suggested the possibility, yes.
- Well, you shouldn't have.

19:52.934 --> 19:55.421
He's got the mental and
emotional capacity of a child.

19:55.471 --> 19:57.413
Yeah, but he's not a child,
though, is he? He's a grown man.

19:57.463 --> 20:00.264
Yeah, well, wishes don't make it
true, do they, doctor?

20:00.314 --> 20:01.901
Look, I was skeptical at first, too,

20:01.951 --> 20:03.969
but if it had been any other
member of her family,

20:04.019 --> 20:05.221
I would have jumped at it.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.168
Will loves his mom.

20:06.218 --> 20:07.650
He wants to save her. Why not let him?

20:07.718 --> 20:10.185
Because he's incapable of understanding

20:10.220 --> 20:12.321
the potential consequences of his choice.

20:12.388 --> 20:14.456
He doesn't understand that he could die.

20:14.524 --> 20:15.825
He understands that she will.

20:15.859 --> 20:17.727
Listen, I actually grew up
with someone who had Downs.

20:17.794 --> 20:19.778
How do you know what he's capable of?

20:19.828 --> 20:22.714
Well, I worked in the prison
system for a little while,

20:22.764 --> 20:26.018
and I learned to accept people
for who they are,

20:26.068 --> 20:27.632
not who I want them to be.

20:27.682 --> 20:29.058
I think he's up for it.

20:29.108 --> 20:30.139
I do.

20:30.685 --> 20:33.790
Why isn't Will here to speak for himself?

20:34.098 --> 20:36.348
It's an able question.

20:37.968 --> 20:39.180
Okay, more FFP and platelets.

20:39.248 --> 20:41.302
Keep it coming. No seventh
inning stretch for you.

20:41.352 --> 20:42.427
- Need cryo?
- Yeah.

20:42.477 --> 20:43.284
Okay.

20:43.852 --> 20:45.119
He's bleeding from everywhere.

20:45.154 --> 20:46.554
- - He's in shock.
- BP's dropping.

20:46.588 --> 20:47.855
Scratch that. Plummeting.

20:47.922 --> 20:49.624
His body can't handle all the fluids.

20:49.691 --> 20:52.627
Okay, BP's 80 over 50.

20:52.694 --> 20:53.827
We're not catching up.
He's just running out of blood.

20:53.895 --> 20:57.297
Okay, push everything. Give him bicarb.

20:57.365 --> 20:59.499
More colloid.

20:59.534 --> 21:01.368
- It's not working.
- Yeah, we see that.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.775
Come on.

21:23.747 --> 21:26.626
Don't let this happen to my son.

21:32.171 --> 21:33.727
I'm asking, did the doctors

21:33.777 --> 21:36.144
explore all of the alternatives with you?

21:36.179 --> 21:37.079
We did.

21:37.113 --> 21:38.313
Excuse me, doctor.

21:38.348 --> 21:39.948
If he's competent to make the decision,

21:39.983 --> 21:42.150
then why isn't anyone letting
William talk for himself?

21:42.185 --> 21:44.853
I'm sorry.

21:45.765 --> 21:47.990
Um, sorry to interrupt. I, um...

21:49.625 --> 21:52.042
Aren't you the guy who pulled
the plug on me?

21:52.244 --> 21:53.028
Noah Stein.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.163
Glad to see you're still
with us, Dr. Harris.

21:55.198 --> 21:57.232
My mom sent you to help me.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.701
Yeah. Hey.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.904
Will and I built a bit of a bond.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.204
To that end, I'd like to, uh,
to speak to his decision

22:07.254 --> 22:09.772
and... and how it affects
both him and his mother.

22:09.822 --> 22:10.969
I have no objection.

22:11.019 --> 22:11.881
Thank you.

22:11.931 --> 22:16.217
Um, now, we all know that this
is a difficult situation.

22:16.919 --> 22:20.037
Two lives are at stake here,
so how do we decide?

22:20.087 --> 22:21.250
No, Charlie.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.204
It's my turn to talk.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.091
Thank you.

22:24.126 --> 22:28.004
Look, I know my mom
won't be with me forever.

22:28.253 --> 22:30.919
But I'm trying to be more independent.

22:30.969 --> 22:33.651
I have a driving learning's license.

22:33.701 --> 22:35.701
I do taekwondo.

22:35.883 --> 22:39.372
I work at a daycare center
three times a week!

22:39.749 --> 22:43.242
Why can't I help my mom?

22:43.310 --> 22:46.638
It's a dangerous and difficult

22:46.749 --> 22:48.736
and complicated procedure,

22:48.855 --> 22:51.702
William. We have to make sure
that you understand

22:51.752 --> 22:52.767
what you're getting into.

22:52.830 --> 22:56.054
I know I could die,

22:56.104 --> 22:58.358
and that does scare me

22:58.392 --> 23:02.295
but I'm more
scared of losing her.

23:02.363 --> 23:05.631
This is my decision!

23:07.760 --> 23:10.169
Do you wish to make your
statement now, Dr. Harris?

23:12.531 --> 23:13.694
Uh, no.

23:13.766 --> 23:17.376
No, I... I think Will's got this one covered.

23:18.512 --> 23:19.645
All right, then.

23:23.459 --> 23:25.494
Make the right decision this time.

23:25.794 --> 23:28.442
I always try to, doctor.

23:33.073 --> 23:34.826
You are...

23:35.192 --> 23:37.701
an articulate young man, William.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.967
I believe you understand
what's required of you.

23:40.017 --> 23:43.393
I'm going to rule that you are
able to give consent

23:43.443 --> 23:45.081
to be a living organ donor.

23:45.131 --> 23:48.084
And I wish you the very best today.

23:48.134 --> 23:49.268
You'll note my objection?

23:49.318 --> 23:50.680
Noted.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.048
Are you all right, Will?

24:01.634 --> 24:04.322
It's okay to be afraid.

24:04.356 --> 24:07.805
Yeah. Of course.

24:09.636 --> 24:12.174
Mrs. Merrifield,
we're very sorry for your loss.

24:12.224 --> 24:14.623
We did everything that we could
to try to save your husband.

24:14.673 --> 24:15.963
My ex-husband.

24:16.293 --> 24:18.171
Colin and I didn't see each other much,

24:18.353 --> 24:20.209
but yeah, we still had a connection.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.679
I guess there always is
when you were married.

24:23.207 --> 24:25.976
It's pathetic. Ironic.

24:26.044 --> 24:27.912
Whatever the right word is.

24:28.896 --> 24:32.195
We broke up over his obsession
with the damn snakes.

24:32.288 --> 24:34.475
He just couldn't let it go.

24:34.725 --> 24:37.454
And now the damn
things have killed him.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.159
Well, um, police services
would like to speak to you

24:42.193 --> 24:44.951
about collecting your ex-husband's exotics.

24:45.256 --> 24:48.026
Uh, again, our sincere condolences.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.960
Well, obsession is the word.

24:54.010 --> 24:55.204
If he'd just come in 12 hours earlier,

24:55.238 --> 24:56.472
we could have saved his life.

24:56.506 --> 24:57.774
Takes one to know one.

24:58.426 --> 24:59.505
What?

24:59.555 --> 25:00.710
Obsession.

25:01.357 --> 25:04.394
Did you really ask her
to marry you again, Charlie?

25:04.444 --> 25:06.119
Ouch.

25:07.037 --> 25:08.750
Hey, Will.

25:09.862 --> 25:12.590
Your mom's procedure
is going very well.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.748
We're removing her damaged liver right now.

25:14.798 --> 25:16.254
You ready to do your part?

25:16.304 --> 25:18.594
- I think so.
- All right.

25:20.097 --> 25:21.273
What's wrong, Will?

25:21.759 --> 25:26.027
Usually my mom goes to my
doctor's appointments with me.

25:26.310 --> 25:28.804
Well, she is right next door
waiting for you.

25:29.309 --> 25:30.866
Time to dream, young man.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.340
Count to 10 with me?

25:33.039 --> 25:34.342
- One.
- One.

25:34.410 --> 25:36.211
- Two.
- Two.

25:36.245 --> 25:39.280
Three. Four.

25:43.135 --> 25:44.725
Ready when you are, Dr. Reid.

25:54.295 --> 25:55.963
How's he doing?

25:56.031 --> 25:57.999
He's terrified.

25:58.033 --> 25:59.967
He's a trouper.

26:00.002 --> 26:01.804
I just wonder what his mom would say

26:01.854 --> 26:03.965
if she knew this was happening to her son.

26:04.015 --> 26:06.443
Well, let's hope we find out.

26:07.373 --> 26:09.095
What's happening with that hand?

26:09.145 --> 26:11.311
Nothing. It's... it's nothing.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.092
Look at me.

26:16.636 --> 26:17.990
Breathe.

26:21.161 --> 26:22.760
You're gonna kick ass.

26:42.422 --> 26:45.357
Looks like someone still wants
to watch over you.

26:46.867 --> 26:47.933
Clamp.

27:00.951 --> 27:03.100
- Instrument failure?
- Get me another one.

27:06.719 --> 27:10.088
So, you got stabbed,
and now you're back at work.

27:10.155 --> 27:12.290
How's that going?

27:13.220 --> 27:14.671
All good.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.996
When you're the anvil, hold thee still.

27:18.063 --> 27:20.664
When you're the hammer, strike thee full.

27:20.699 --> 27:22.466
I don't know what that means.

27:22.501 --> 27:24.535
Well, is it hammer time?

27:25.367 --> 27:27.077
Dr. Rocca, I still don't know
what that means.

27:28.707 --> 27:31.008
Saw you out there with Dr. Goran.

27:32.092 --> 27:32.676
Yeah?

27:32.711 --> 27:34.912
Your heart just got fixed.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.747
Be careful with it.

27:39.217 --> 27:42.219
How do his right side bile ducts
look to you?

27:42.253 --> 27:44.955
Long enough. Good caliber. Well perfused.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.190
His surgeon looks scared.

27:47.935 --> 27:49.293
I can see it in her face.

27:50.008 --> 27:52.262
Well, you're wrong. She's a rock.

27:52.998 --> 27:54.597
The other doctor looks mean.

27:55.256 --> 27:58.002
What... what is your problem
with doctors, anyway?

27:58.052 --> 27:59.046
'Cause as far as I can tell,

27:59.096 --> 28:00.069
there are three of them down there

28:00.103 --> 28:01.771
trying very hard to save your life,

28:01.806 --> 28:03.372
- and your son's, too.
- My problem?

28:05.275 --> 28:10.112
The obstetrician who told me
I should just let Will die.

28:11.002 --> 28:13.583
The pediatrician who swore
he'd never be able to walk.

28:14.081 --> 28:16.485
The cardiologist who asked me

28:16.519 --> 28:20.022
when he needed heart surgery
why I wanted to bother with it.

28:20.057 --> 28:24.726
No one believes in Will except me.

28:28.432 --> 28:30.499
Well, believe in him now.

28:36.442 --> 28:37.906
So, we're good here.

28:37.941 --> 28:40.141
Lift it out gently.

28:44.609 --> 28:47.764
Pack it in slush. This is precious cargo.

28:53.774 --> 28:54.722
Okay.

28:54.756 --> 28:57.577
I am here, B-team, ready to
score the touchdown for you.

28:57.627 --> 28:58.503
Where's my liver?

28:58.553 --> 28:59.902
Perfect timing, Reycraft.

29:00.054 --> 29:01.104
Thank you.

29:01.154 --> 29:04.099
SATs are good. All vitals are stable.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.432
B-team rules.

29:05.501 --> 29:07.334
"Silver is the best,
better than all the rest."

29:07.964 --> 29:09.824
There's a little quote of my own.

29:10.053 --> 29:11.178
Nice.

29:11.309 --> 29:12.540
Sorry.

29:13.026 --> 29:14.709
Maggie, can you help Dr. Rocca close?

29:14.743 --> 29:16.964
I'd like to assist Reycraft
in Katie's transplant.

29:17.014 --> 29:18.187
- No problem, roomie.
- Thanks.

29:18.237 --> 29:19.981
And, uh, can you stop calling me that?

29:20.685 --> 29:23.410
What? Roomie? You don't like it?

29:23.460 --> 29:24.551
Not so much.

29:26.649 --> 29:27.982
We're good, right?

29:28.032 --> 29:29.323
Never better.

29:31.026 --> 29:33.427
It went well.

29:33.461 --> 29:35.729
They'll transplant the liver, stabilize you,

29:35.796 --> 29:38.715
and then Dr. Goran will operate
on your spine.

29:38.889 --> 29:40.667
My spine?

29:40.735 --> 29:42.836
Oh, god, no.

29:43.723 --> 29:45.381
If I can't move...

29:45.778 --> 29:47.990
I don't want to be a burden to my son.

29:48.083 --> 29:51.716
Well, you didn't think
he could do this.

29:52.110 --> 29:53.513
who knows what he can handle, right?

29:53.548 --> 29:56.115
I do believe in him.

29:56.183 --> 29:58.551
I do.

29:59.418 --> 30:01.787
I know he wants... Wants it...

30:01.855 --> 30:04.957
Wants to be more independent.

30:05.025 --> 30:06.859
I'm trying, but...

30:08.262 --> 30:10.740
It's just so hard to let go.

30:13.181 --> 30:14.433
Yeah.

30:14.483 --> 30:17.317
Letting go isn't easy, but...

30:18.856 --> 30:20.673
Sometimes it's the only way.

30:27.277 --> 30:28.568
This is weird.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.948
What?

30:29.982 --> 30:32.084
I'm not seeing the ligamentous injury

30:32.118 --> 30:34.786
I expected from Katie's MRI.

30:34.820 --> 30:36.754
What are you gonna do?

30:38.891 --> 30:40.592
Joel?

30:40.626 --> 30:44.395
Hey, um, hey, I hear you have
a-a surgical board study group,

30:44.429 --> 30:46.097
and I would... I would love
to be a part of it.

30:46.131 --> 30:48.407
I know I can more than pull my own weight.

30:48.885 --> 30:49.596
Not now, Rian.

30:49.646 --> 30:50.835
Okay, check this out, okay?

30:50.869 --> 30:53.004
I-I have three years of detailed
notes on general surgery,

30:53.038 --> 30:54.839
and I have three years of previous exams.

30:54.873 --> 30:57.274
I have absolutely everything
we need to pass these boards.

30:57.309 --> 30:59.510
Like I said, now is not the time.

31:03.176 --> 31:05.697
I also have this really wicked
karaoke machine.

31:07.376 --> 31:10.873
Karaoke's not my thing, but come on by.

31:11.736 --> 31:12.832
- So I'm in?
- Yeah.

31:12.882 --> 31:14.225
You had me at detailed notes.

31:17.311 --> 31:18.561
Yes!

31:22.407 --> 31:24.653
Vallenwe'en?

31:24.742 --> 31:27.303
How's my sweetie, hey?

31:27.791 --> 31:29.506
Did you have a good nap?

31:35.197 --> 31:36.520
Vall?

31:38.157 --> 31:39.486
Hey, have you seen Dr. Lin?

31:39.536 --> 31:40.816
Yeah, uh, surgery O.R. 3.

31:40.851 --> 31:42.084
Code brown in effect.

31:42.119 --> 31:43.219
Hey, what is with this code brown?

31:43.287 --> 31:44.320
I mean, what the hell spilled?

31:44.355 --> 31:45.688
Uh, nothing.

31:45.722 --> 31:47.190
An animal's loose in the hospital.

31:47.224 --> 31:50.026
Vallenwe'en. How did they know that?

31:50.060 --> 31:53.696
Actually, it's another animal that's loose.

31:57.768 --> 31:59.669
104 degrees.

31:59.703 --> 32:01.570
That is one crazy fever.

32:01.604 --> 32:02.872
I hallucinated.

32:02.939 --> 32:04.140
Yeah? Well, I'm not surprised.

32:04.207 --> 32:05.445
I mean, there's nothing to worry
about, though.

32:05.495 --> 32:07.099
That's perfectly normal.

32:07.742 --> 32:09.282
It seemed so real,

32:09.332 --> 32:12.181
these sucking sounds all from under the bed.

32:12.215 --> 32:13.615
Am I going crazy?

32:15.518 --> 32:16.985
No.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.455
There's nothing to worry about.

32:18.505 --> 32:20.037
It's totally normal.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.491
Can you check, please?

32:24.498 --> 32:25.763
Yep.

32:38.464 --> 32:40.007
It's all good.

32:43.683 --> 32:45.282
Jackson!

32:48.750 --> 32:50.518
Nice work, Reid.

32:50.552 --> 32:53.592
Mom's got a pretty good shot
the transplant will take.

32:57.358 --> 32:58.892
Ah, the mighty orthopod has come

32:58.927 --> 33:01.161
to see how we've messed
with his patient's spine.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.164
We've been as gentle as lowly
surgeons could be, Dr. Goran.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.199
Wake her up.

33:05.266 --> 33:06.734
What? Why?

33:06.801 --> 33:08.435
I'm playing a hunch.
It's the only way I can do this.

33:08.502 --> 33:09.903
Okay.

33:09.938 --> 33:13.206
Wake her up, please.

33:14.508 --> 33:16.509
If you love something, set it free.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.745
If it comes back, it's yours.

33:18.812 --> 33:22.249
My god. That's so maudlin.

33:22.316 --> 33:24.684
You think it could be true?

33:24.752 --> 33:27.354
I don't know. I'd like to.

33:27.421 --> 33:31.724
But sometimes a boomerang
is just a stick, isn't it?

33:33.093 --> 33:34.426
What's happening?

33:34.461 --> 33:37.329
I-I feel strange.

33:37.364 --> 33:40.699
My... my hands are tingling.

33:40.734 --> 33:43.069
They're burning.

33:43.103 --> 33:44.637
Am I dying?

33:52.646 --> 33:54.380
Katie?

33:54.414 --> 33:57.249
You've been in a car accident, Katie.

33:57.284 --> 33:59.385
I need to know whether or not

33:59.419 --> 34:02.387
you can feel a burning sensation
in your hands,

34:02.421 --> 34:05.056
like, um, your leg fell asleep

34:05.091 --> 34:06.858
and you felt an awful cramp in it.

34:06.893 --> 34:09.127
Can you feel anything like that
in your hands?

34:09.161 --> 34:10.929
Okay, that's actually a good sign.

34:10.963 --> 34:13.331
It means that you have
central cord syndrome.

34:13.364 --> 34:14.732
What?

34:14.766 --> 34:16.902
Basically, Katie, what that means is,

34:16.936 --> 34:19.103
you have a big bruise near your spine,

34:19.137 --> 34:20.938
but none of the nerves were severed,

34:20.972 --> 34:22.806
so we don't actually have to operate.

34:22.841 --> 34:24.942
Just need to wait and see how you respond.

34:24.976 --> 34:27.312
With rehab, you should be able
to walk again.

34:27.346 --> 34:28.346
Where's Will?

34:29.667 --> 34:31.047
Will's fine, Katie.

34:31.081 --> 34:32.583
He's just resting.

34:32.618 --> 34:34.719
He just saved your life.

34:46.995 --> 34:49.190
You paged me? you found Vallenwe'en?

34:49.663 --> 34:50.822
Yeah, I think so.

34:51.085 --> 34:52.873
What do you mean, you think so?

34:53.998 --> 34:56.291
She's not exactly visible.

34:56.494 --> 34:57.532
Well, where is she?

34:57.566 --> 34:58.933
Uh, she's...

35:06.885 --> 35:09.461
That's her sweater. What happened?

35:10.349 --> 35:12.112
We got this snake...

35:12.777 --> 35:14.824
It's the food chain, doc.

35:20.588 --> 35:22.179
What's wrong?

35:22.949 --> 35:24.640
She's dead.

35:25.186 --> 35:26.493
Oh, hey.

35:26.528 --> 35:28.295
It's okay.

35:28.363 --> 35:30.764
It's not your fault.
Want to tell me what happened?

35:31.881 --> 35:34.200
Vallenwe'en has been...

35:34.268 --> 35:36.292
Eaten by a snake.

35:38.733 --> 35:40.128
You serious?

35:40.454 --> 35:41.908
The pig thing?

35:42.573 --> 35:44.410
That's

35:46.299 --> 35:47.898
uh...

35:49.733 --> 35:51.150
Yes, the pig thing.

35:51.738 --> 35:52.644
Okay.

35:52.694 --> 35:54.720
I loved her.

35:54.788 --> 35:57.090
I really, really loved her.

35:57.625 --> 35:59.043
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, but...

35:59.093 --> 35:59.992
Go to hell.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.128
Is this for real?

36:02.196 --> 36:03.963
What's the big deal?

36:04.030 --> 36:05.631
Get another one!

36:05.699 --> 36:07.199
She loved her.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.610
I love you, mom.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.322
Mm.

36:19.879 --> 36:21.413
Welcome back, Katie.

36:22.794 --> 36:24.042
Who are you?

36:24.486 --> 36:25.717
Uh, I'm Dr. Harris,

36:25.751 --> 36:28.559
but, um, don't let the "doctor"
part put you off.

36:28.631 --> 36:32.552
Dr. Harris talked to you for me
when you were sleeping.

36:35.928 --> 36:38.930
Hello. How are you both feeling?

36:38.964 --> 36:40.765
- Will?
- Okay.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.500
Good.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.468
Well, Katie, I have some good news for you.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.138
The transplant went well,
and your enzymes are spot-on,

36:47.172 --> 36:49.507
but there will be a lot
of follow-up and therapy

36:49.541 --> 36:51.375
for both of you, okay?

36:51.409 --> 36:53.614
I'll take care of her.

36:53.851 --> 36:56.413
I'm sure you will, mate.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.250
Um, you still need a ride home, Alex?

37:02.635 --> 37:03.521
Okay, well, good night.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.222
We'll see both of you in the morning.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.957
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.194
Good night, Charlie.

37:11.228 --> 37:12.629
Good night.

37:20.754 --> 37:23.524
Night-night, Zach.
Let's try again tomorrow, eh?

37:23.574 --> 37:24.844
Is that a snake in your pocket,

37:24.894 --> 37:26.958
or are you just happy to say
good night to me?

37:28.785 --> 37:30.706
They're just gonna kill it, man.

37:32.330 --> 37:33.446
All right.

37:33.603 --> 37:36.280
I won't tell Dawn that you
saved her murderer.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.403
Thanks.

37:41.292 --> 37:42.592
Goodbye, Vallenwe'en.

37:43.322 --> 37:45.460
Alas, I never really knew you.

37:55.422 --> 37:58.039
You okay, Dawn?

37:58.075 --> 38:00.542
Leave me alone, Charlie.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.384
When you gonna stop
pushing people away?

38:09.434 --> 38:11.086
I mean it.

38:25.493 --> 38:27.335
I've been with you through
way worse than this.

38:28.804 --> 38:30.772
And when you say you want to be alone...

38:30.840 --> 38:34.108
It's because you're sad,

38:34.175 --> 38:36.577
and really it's the last thing
that you want.

38:50.225 --> 38:52.492
I lost a patient today,

38:52.526 --> 38:55.095
and I didn't feel a thing.

38:55.163 --> 38:58.999
Yeah. Because you're a pro.

38:59.067 --> 39:01.635
That's the training.

39:01.702 --> 39:03.443
I lost my guinea pig,

39:03.511 --> 39:05.138
and I'm a complete wreck.

39:11.145 --> 39:13.980
Am I such an awful, awful person?

39:14.047 --> 39:16.182
No, you're not.

39:16.250 --> 39:18.151
Well, I must be.

39:22.122 --> 39:23.689
Because I'm all alone.

39:29.196 --> 39:31.463
I'm here.

39:38.238 --> 39:40.906
Yeah. You are.

39:42.842 --> 39:43.975
I'm sorry.

39:49.816 --> 39:51.183

41:19.703 --> 41:22.772
Guess I'm feeling a little
nostalgic for my lost youth.

41:24.775 --> 41:27.576
So, this is our surgical board study group?

41:27.644 --> 41:29.812
Well, just the, uh... the first night, boss.

41:29.846 --> 41:32.147
Uh, uh, figured we needed a little bit of,

41:32.215 --> 41:34.482
um, uh... team building.

41:34.550 --> 41:36.518
- Yep. Team building.

"Sweep up the ashes in the
morning," if you please.

41:46.362 --> 41:48.663
