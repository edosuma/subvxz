00:06.605 --> 00:09.080
I feel like I'm being watched.

00:09.081 --> 00:12.879
Somebody smothering me, putting
their hand on my face.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.715
It grabbed me by the back
of my head and, like...

00:15.716 --> 00:19.082
Somebody's holding her down, choking her.

00:19.083 --> 00:21.408
I am seeing, shadow figures.

00:21.409 --> 00:24.315
I'd wake up to a shadowy figure,
right at the foot of my bed.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.645
He was speaking in Tongues.

00:25.646 --> 00:27.360
Sounds like something out of The Exorcist.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.810
I hate this house, I hate it.

00:28.811 --> 00:29.982
Get out!

00:29.983 --> 00:31.747
- I'm scared.
- It's frightening.

00:31.748 --> 00:33.498
Got to be something in here doing it.

00:33.499 --> 00:36.977
I don't know what's happening.

00:36.978 --> 00:40.098
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.186 --> 00:41.625
There's something down there.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.327
I see dead people.

00:43.328 --> 00:44.728
He doesn't want me back there.

00:44.729 --> 00:47.064
I speak to dead people...

00:47.065 --> 00:48.632
She's pissed.

00:48.633 --> 00:49.767
And they speak to me...

00:49.768 --> 00:52.225
She doesn't like the people who live here.

00:52.226 --> 00:55.406
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.407 --> 00:57.028
Someone did hang themselves here.

00:57.029 --> 00:58.842
- Where?
- There.

00:58.843 --> 01:00.528
I rely on my partner.

01:00.529 --> 01:04.147
I'm Steve Dischiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective...

01:04.149 --> 01:05.650
Did you want to kill him?

01:05.651 --> 01:09.286
And I know every person, every house...
has secrets.

01:09.287 --> 01:10.994
She did die in this house.

01:10.995 --> 01:12.346
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.347 --> 01:14.748
Would you be surprised if there
were bodies in this basement?

01:14.749 --> 01:15.653
No.

01:15.654 --> 01:17.211
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.212 --> 01:19.129
We never communicated
during an investigation...

01:19.130 --> 01:20.564
Until the very end...

01:20.565 --> 01:21.865
Not good.

01:21.866 --> 01:24.001
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.002 --> 01:25.102
Will it get worse?

01:25.103 --> 01:26.303
Or time to get out.

01:26.304 --> 01:29.184
- Oh, yes.
- Whew.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.726 --> 01:53.437
Steve will dig into the
history of a location,

01:53.438 --> 01:56.283
and he'll interview the people involved.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.080
He'll gather all the facts so
that later when we come together,

01:59.081 --> 02:04.981
we can see if our research has
drawn any significant conclusions.

02:05.310 --> 02:08.966
I'm headed to a small town
in California called Acampo.

02:08.967 --> 02:13.103
We've got an elderly woman that
lives in a farmhouse alone.

02:13.104 --> 02:17.787
She raised her children there, and her
children actually reached out to us.

02:17.788 --> 02:20.277
They're concerned for her because
as they were growing up,

02:20.278 --> 02:24.414
they were tormented by a black smoky
figure they're convinced was a spirit.

02:24.415 --> 02:27.633
They say she's not afraid,
but that she should be.

02:27.634 --> 02:33.534
So I'm gonna go meet with the mom
now and see what I can find out.

02:35.657 --> 02:41.557
Before I enter a location, Matt
will do what we call a cleaning.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.860
He'll remove any personal items, photos,

02:44.861 --> 02:50.761
or any other information that could
possibly influence my findings.

02:50.932 --> 02:54.172
And then I do my walk.

03:04.695 --> 03:08.654
The second I step onto this property,
I can feel that something's wrong.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.575
Okay.

03:11.433 --> 03:17.193
There's a powerful presence
in this house, and it's evil.

03:17.571 --> 03:20.391
It's really evil.

03:27.057 --> 03:31.677
I see two big hands trying to pull me in.

03:37.525 --> 03:40.945
Let me just wander a bit.

03:42.385 --> 03:45.774
Like, I feel like it comes...

03:45.775 --> 03:49.255
In and out of the closets.

03:52.354 --> 03:55.306
There's something darker.

03:55.307 --> 03:57.750
I want to hide.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.518
This is, like, so bizarre.

03:59.519 --> 04:02.497
Like, I don't even want
to open this closet.

04:02.498 --> 04:06.278
It's like the physical doorway.

04:06.326 --> 04:10.286
That's where they're coming from.

04:37.050 --> 04:40.710
- Lorraine?
- Hi. Come on in.

04:40.886 --> 04:43.467
Well, let me just cut to the
chase, your kids called,

04:43.468 --> 04:46.729
they're a little concerned about the
stuff that goes on in this house.

04:46.730 --> 04:50.659
And I figured I'd start with you
since you live here alone, right?

04:50.660 --> 04:51.854
Yes, I do.

04:51.855 --> 04:54.443
Your husband's been deceased for about...
almost eight years.

04:54.444 --> 04:55.455
- Eight years?
- Mm hmm.

04:55.456 --> 04:57.162
And did he have any experiences?

04:57.163 --> 04:59.817
He had an experience himself several times,

04:59.818 --> 05:03.236
and he was telling me about it,
but I didn't really take it...

05:03.237 --> 05:06.288
I don't take things seriously.

05:06.289 --> 05:09.006
- I laughed it off.
- Are you shutting it out?

05:09.007 --> 05:10.425
More or less, yes.

05:10.426 --> 05:14.113
Lorraine seems to think that by
ignoring the problem, it will go away.

05:14.114 --> 05:19.934
Now I understand why her kids
are concerned for her safety.

05:20.168 --> 05:26.068
Maybe people have seen something you
know, out of the corner of their eye.

05:28.076 --> 05:33.416
You kind of look up, and
you kind of see something.

05:35.808 --> 05:41.708
Little movements, little things at
first, but then it got not so good.

05:44.733 --> 05:48.513
I don't know what's happening.

05:52.734 --> 05:55.777
Maybe you could just tell me some of
the things you've seen in the house.

05:55.778 --> 05:59.075
I've seen a few shadows, you know, but...

05:59.076 --> 06:01.136
I've not seen what my
children have seen, so...

06:01.137 --> 06:03.216
Okay, but you have
experienced seeing shadows.

06:03.217 --> 06:06.147
Shadows, yeah. But it just
passes, and it's gone.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.283
Where do you see them?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.791
Sometimes if you're sitting down
watching TV, all of a sudden,

06:10.792 --> 06:13.622
you see something go by, or
you know, with your eye or...

06:13.623 --> 06:15.879
- Okay.
- And it just quickly...

06:15.880 --> 06:18.049
- I've seen it in my bedroom.
- In your bedroom?

06:18.050 --> 06:20.529
- Mm hmm.
- And how often do you see these?

06:20.530 --> 06:23.440
Not all the time. It's just every so often.

06:23.441 --> 06:27.641
- And it doesn't frighten you?
- No.

06:31.406 --> 06:37.106
I feel like there's more kind
of going on in this area.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.983
Wait a minute.

06:45.895 --> 06:49.331
I am seeing, like, shadow figures.

06:49.332 --> 06:54.132
Not our shadows, other...
like, shadow beings.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.761
Which makes me un-com-fort-able.

06:57.762 --> 07:01.302
I do not like those things.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.925
When was the first time anybody experienced
anything unusual in the house?

07:09.926 --> 07:11.627
I think my daughter Laura was the first.

07:11.628 --> 07:14.744
She was playing with her sister, and
they were running down the stairs,

07:14.745 --> 07:17.866
and she went down into
my room, going into it.

07:17.867 --> 07:22.717
And she had experienced something
going across, like a dark...

07:22.718 --> 07:26.618
I don't know how to explain it.

07:27.518 --> 07:31.213
There's this evilness, these shadow beings.

07:31.214 --> 07:33.396
Shadow people, we don't
know much about them.

07:33.397 --> 07:35.586
We don't know where they come from.

07:35.587 --> 07:40.147
They're just bad. They're very, very bad.

07:42.991 --> 07:45.327
- Now your youngest is Joe.
- Mm hmm.

07:45.328 --> 07:47.329
Did he start experiencing anything?

07:47.330 --> 07:49.779
Yes, when he was probably around 4.

07:49.780 --> 07:53.548
I guess he'd have a bad dream or something
was bothering him while he was sleeping,

07:53.549 --> 07:58.025
and then he'd get up and be on the
edge of his bed and sitting there,

07:58.026 --> 08:00.785
and he'd have his eyes, like,
going up, and he'd go...

08:00.786 --> 08:02.513
You know, like that?

08:02.514 --> 08:06.382
Like, just not making sense,
what he was trying to say.

08:06.383 --> 08:08.986
So what was actually
coming out of his mouth?

08:08.987 --> 08:13.841
He was speaking in Tongues,
he was just going on...

08:13.842 --> 08:17.028
- You know, rolling his tongue and just...
- Okay so...

08:17.029 --> 08:20.699
With his eyes rolled back
like somebody was...

08:20.700 --> 08:23.213
You know, talking to him,
I guess, I don't know.

08:23.214 --> 08:27.109
I don't know why he was doing it, but I
guess he was seeing whatever he was seeing.

08:27.110 --> 08:29.828
Lorraine, that sounds like
something out of The Exorcist.

08:29.829 --> 08:32.958
Well, that's what I'm saying.
He wasn't himself, you know?

08:32.960 --> 08:36.140
Yeah, he was possessed.

08:47.950 --> 08:50.753
- You okay?
- Hmm, not really.

08:50.754 --> 08:53.262
I'm kind of uncomfortable here.

08:53.263 --> 08:55.871
The first time I encountered shadow people,

08:55.872 --> 08:59.481
I was 4 years old, and
they tried to kill me.

08:59.482 --> 09:01.731
They convinced me that
they were my friends.

09:01.732 --> 09:05.821
And that I could go with them if I bit
the electrical cord in my bedroom.

09:05.822 --> 09:08.162
And I did.

09:09.232 --> 09:11.463
I don't really like the
information I'm getting.

09:11.464 --> 09:14.275
All I know is that there's
frickin' shadow people here.

09:14.276 --> 09:18.056
So, frankly, I hate this house.

09:34.305 --> 09:38.144
There's this evilness, these shadow beings.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.520
Shadow people, we don't much about them.

09:40.521 --> 09:42.788
We don't know where they come from.

09:42.789 --> 09:46.459
They're just bad. They're very, very bad.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.095
Shadow people are a mystery.

09:49.096 --> 09:51.697
We don't know if they were
once living people or not.

09:51.698 --> 09:57.598
What we do know is that they can literally
drain the life from a living person.

10:02.452 --> 10:06.974
Bad with the closets. The
closets are just bad here.

10:06.975 --> 10:10.155
This is where they go.

10:13.222 --> 10:18.922
Someone here tries to protect
this room from these things.

10:21.364 --> 10:24.133
This is a female. She's
trying to protect this room.

10:24.134 --> 10:28.620
Stay out, get out, get
out, stay out, get out.

10:28.621 --> 10:33.984
As long as a spirit is not hurting
me, I don't take things seriously.

10:33.985 --> 10:37.277
Obviously, Lorraine has not been
tormented by these shadows.

10:37.278 --> 10:42.438
But the kids were, so I
need to speak with them.

10:43.219 --> 10:46.391
Right in here is my mom and dad's room.

10:46.392 --> 10:48.997
All right, this is where you had
your first experience, you said?

10:48.998 --> 10:49.920
Yeah.

10:49.921 --> 10:53.767
My sister Joanna was babysitting
me and my brother Joey.

10:53.768 --> 10:57.424
And I was upstairs, and
she was chasing after me,

10:57.425 --> 11:00.431
and I was bolting for this room because
I wanted to run and shut the door.

11:00.432 --> 11:01.242
Right.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.904
And instead, as I ran, all of a
sudden, I just stopped like this.

11:04.905 --> 11:09.408
Then she was coming right behind me.
She stopped, too.

11:09.409 --> 11:12.758
And from this point, this thing just...

11:12.759 --> 11:15.673
Went like this in front of us...

11:15.674 --> 11:20.480
Like not fast, not slow, but
just like at a perfect speed.

11:20.481 --> 11:23.197
Laura, did this mass have
any kind of a shape?

11:23.198 --> 11:25.836
No. It was cold, and it was thick black.

11:25.837 --> 11:27.179
- Okay.
- It made us stop.

11:27.180 --> 11:31.140
So it could pass in front of us.

11:36.669 --> 11:39.311
I feel like there's something in here.

11:39.312 --> 11:45.192
That has walked through the
room, in and out of the room...

11:46.449 --> 11:48.556
Around the bed a lot.

11:48.557 --> 11:54.457
There's been arguments with this
entity, this black shadow being.

11:57.465 --> 12:01.965
I feel like there's been words exchanged.

12:02.660 --> 12:05.212
So this is my room that I grew up in,

12:05.213 --> 12:07.709
and, um, this is the room that's
terrified me to the point

12:07.710 --> 12:10.586
where I don't even come in
here anymore when I visit.

12:10.587 --> 12:11.766
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.369
At night, when I would try to go to bed,

12:13.370 --> 12:16.813
I would always try to cover myself up
because if I had any part of me exposed,

12:16.814 --> 12:19.535
something would touch me,
or if my face was exposed,

12:19.536 --> 12:22.029
I'd feel somebody breathing
or something on top of me.

12:22.030 --> 12:25.750
Then I couldn't move, and I couldn't talk.
I couldn't do anything.

12:25.751 --> 12:27.166
You literally couldn't move.

12:27.167 --> 12:30.388
My body was just dead weight.

12:30.389 --> 12:33.113
I would wish it away, um, pray,

12:33.114 --> 12:38.814
do whatever I could to get
this thing to leave me alone.

12:39.857 --> 12:41.541
How old were you when this was happening?

12:41.542 --> 12:44.121
Around like 11 to 13 and then on

12:44.122 --> 12:48.138
because I stayed in this room up
until I was probably like 19.

12:48.139 --> 12:50.174
This happened to you as you got older?

12:50.175 --> 12:52.405
- Yeah.
- And you understood it?

12:52.406 --> 12:53.505
Mm-hmm.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.613
And it wasn't a small-child fear anymore.

12:56.614 --> 12:58.007
No.

12:58.008 --> 12:59.808
No.

13:02.608 --> 13:05.650
I'm getting somebody waking up in the
middle of the night freaking out.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.323
Can't breathe, being pushed on.

13:08.324 --> 13:13.484
And it's these shadow beings,
these shadow people.

13:14.459 --> 13:18.063
I hear somebody screaming. I'm
hearing a female screaming.

13:18.064 --> 13:21.699
Something physical happened to this female.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.199
Somebody putting their hand
over her mouth and her nose,

13:25.200 --> 13:29.580
holding her down and, like, choking her.

13:31.351 --> 13:34.603
It came one night when I was
in here and I'd fallen asleep.

13:34.604 --> 13:38.483
All of a sudden, I see
this, like, black thing...

13:38.484 --> 13:41.595
Like a smoky black thing
on this side right here.

13:41.596 --> 13:44.738
- All right.
- It shoots up the wall like this...

13:44.739 --> 13:47.807
Like a snake kind of thing,
and it goes up to there,

13:47.808 --> 13:50.765
and then it goes up there, and
then it goes along there.

13:50.766 --> 13:54.712
And then it goes over here, and then
right where my head is over here.

13:54.713 --> 13:58.558
It goes down, and then, like,
I heard this loud noise.

13:58.559 --> 14:00.840
It kind of grabbed me by the
back of my head and, like,

14:00.841 --> 14:02.245
starting hitting my head like this.

14:02.246 --> 14:06.267
So I am frozen, and I'm
lying here, and I...

14:06.268 --> 14:10.726
Finally, like, get myself out of it, and
I jump up, and I ran across the room,

14:10.727 --> 14:13.318
slid open the door, and ran to the balcony.

14:13.319 --> 14:16.365
And I look down and I'm like,
dad, I can't take it anymore.

14:16.366 --> 14:18.352
There's a ghost in my
room, I'm going crazy,

14:18.353 --> 14:20.300
you know, I can't deal with this anymore.

14:20.301 --> 14:24.930
And he goes, your little brother was up
sleepwalking towards the basement saying...

14:24.931 --> 14:27.480
"Leave me alone. Go away, leave me alone".

14:27.481 --> 14:31.852
And I had to get him and grab him
and shake him, and he woke up.

14:31.853 --> 14:37.753
And then I put him back to sleep, and then
you just came out five minutes later.

14:41.182 --> 14:44.422
I just feel like the...

14:46.174 --> 14:50.342
Somebody's shaking me and
yelling at me, and...

14:50.343 --> 14:52.584
I'm small...

14:52.585 --> 14:55.888
And I can't do anything, and they're
shaking the breath out of me.

14:55.889 --> 15:00.629
And I'm being yelled at by this older male.

15:03.682 --> 15:06.673
And it seems like you, your brother,
and your father all have this,

15:06.674 --> 15:08.096
connection as far as...

15:08.097 --> 15:09.501
- Mm hmm.
- Things happening to you.

15:09.502 --> 15:12.904
I come to find out it happened
to, like, my sisters, as well.

15:12.905 --> 15:16.575
But we never really talked about it
because we were all kind of embarrassed.

15:16.576 --> 15:19.536
My little brother was the
one who was actively,

15:19.537 --> 15:22.857
talking and seeing the actual figures.

15:22.858 --> 15:26.327
He was really little when all
this stuff was happening.

15:26.328 --> 15:30.948
I feel like I'm being, like, watched by...

15:31.043 --> 15:33.568
These shadow people.

15:33.569 --> 15:36.792
Like, they're just watching right now.

15:36.793 --> 15:41.089
- So they're present?
- I feel like they're present now.

15:41.090 --> 15:46.136
Like, in here. I feel like they're in here
and they're being... they're, like...

15:46.137 --> 15:48.717
Watching, um...

15:50.480 --> 15:53.480
Which I don't like.

16:08.735 --> 16:13.355
I feel like I'm being, like, watched by...

16:13.372 --> 16:16.312
These shadow people.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.287
Are they influencing in any way, or...

16:24.288 --> 16:26.088
Mm.

16:26.237 --> 16:28.037
No.

16:28.350 --> 16:29.890
They just kill people.

16:29.891 --> 16:32.364
They just kill kids, and
they kill the elderly.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.881
That's what the shadow people do.

16:34.882 --> 16:39.920
These beings kill children by luring
them into dangerous situations.

16:39.921 --> 16:42.817
Like they did to me.

16:42.818 --> 16:44.611
They can prey on the elderly,

16:44.612 --> 16:49.332
by slowly draining the life
out of them as they sleep.

16:49.333 --> 16:54.503
- So what are they doing in this case?
- They're sucking someone's life out.

16:54.504 --> 16:58.288
But it seems like slowly they're
doing it to this person.

16:58.289 --> 16:59.981
And they're like just tormenting people,

16:59.982 --> 17:05.082
and there's a lot of 'em,
and I'm freaked out.

17:06.449 --> 17:09.471
Both Laura and her mother say
that Laura's brother Joe,

17:09.472 --> 17:12.362
was most violently affected
by the shadowy figures.

17:12.363 --> 17:16.383
So I need to speak with him next.

17:16.894 --> 17:19.363
When I was a kid, I used to
see a lot of crazy stuff.

17:19.364 --> 17:21.699
A lot of it happened
upstairs in my old bedroom.

17:21.700 --> 17:27.534
Some nights, when I was around 6 or
7, I'd wake up to a shadowy figure.

17:27.535 --> 17:31.500
And it was always the same spot, it
was right at the entrance of my room.

17:31.501 --> 17:33.281
And right at the foot of my bed.

17:33.282 --> 17:35.880
The only thing I could
really make out of it was,

17:35.881 --> 17:39.106
it looked like a man
wearing a hat, top hat.

17:39.107 --> 17:44.442
And whenever I woke up and saw this
figure or the shadow, I couldn't move.

17:44.443 --> 17:48.930
And I just had a chill to my body and
was just frightened, really frightened.

17:48.931 --> 17:52.837
Did you get woken up by anything,
like a touch or anything like that?

17:52.838 --> 17:55.545
On different occasions,
yes, but not all the time.

17:55.546 --> 17:57.647
Sometimes I would wake up to a feeling that

17:57.648 --> 18:01.741
someone was grabbing my feet
or screwing with my toes.

18:01.742 --> 18:04.955
- How often did this happen?
- Quite often as a kid.

18:04.956 --> 18:08.792
Now, when this happened, it happened
when you said you were younger, about 7?

18:08.793 --> 18:09.920
Correct.

18:09.921 --> 18:12.629
Okay, and how long did it last?
Till how old?

18:12.630 --> 18:15.165
It carried on throughout my... my youth.

18:15.166 --> 18:19.400
It... it really slowed down when
I was at the age of 11 or 12.

18:19.401 --> 18:22.705
Because then I started sleeping
downstairs in this living room.

18:22.706 --> 18:28.346
I couldn't sleep in my room anymore.
I was that scared.

18:32.182 --> 18:35.482
That room is really bad.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.322
That room's horrid. I hate it.

18:38.323 --> 18:41.803
- I hate that room.
- Why?

18:43.026 --> 18:48.006
I think a lot of bad
things happened in there.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.801
And I feel like there's been
shadow people in there.

18:51.802 --> 18:54.668
I can't [Bleep] breathe.

18:54.669 --> 18:56.974
Now you seem like you were
pretty close with your father.

18:56.975 --> 18:57.776
Yeah.

18:57.777 --> 19:01.390
Could you get into detail about what you
and your father experienced together?

19:01.391 --> 19:04.390
We never really said anything about it,
we just kind of look at each other,

19:04.391 --> 19:07.122
and we knew that we both
kind of saw the same thing.

19:07.123 --> 19:08.852
Okay, but you guys never discussed it.

19:08.853 --> 19:11.733
Never discussed it.

19:12.090 --> 19:15.323
Did your father ever talk to
you about stuff that he saw?

19:15.324 --> 19:18.604
At this time, I was pretty young,
and I think that they, uh,

19:18.605 --> 19:24.505
didn't want to talk to me about it because
maybe it would have made it worse.

19:29.973 --> 19:32.811
I hear, like, Soul Reaper.

19:32.812 --> 19:36.725
It's eking out the person's life.

19:36.726 --> 19:38.482
Sucking out the person's life.

19:38.483 --> 19:42.986
And I'm getting a male that's
being kind of slowly killed.

19:42.987 --> 19:48.687
By this thing, this black entity,
this black shadow being.

19:49.081 --> 19:51.061
Did mom have any experiences here?

19:51.062 --> 19:53.300
- If she did, she wouldn't tell us.
- She wouldn't?

19:53.301 --> 19:55.965
Yeah, she holds her cards
pretty close to her chest.

19:55.966 --> 19:57.679
Why is that?

19:57.680 --> 20:02.131
I'm not sure. I think my mom's had a
lot of stuff go on in her life that...

20:02.132 --> 20:04.183
Forced her to build a brick wall around it.

20:04.184 --> 20:09.464
And, uh, you know, she deals
with things internally.

20:10.155 --> 20:12.398
Just lots of icky things going...

20:12.399 --> 20:16.299
I just... I can't even do this.

20:17.555 --> 20:19.956
Just knowing that there's a
bunch of shadow people here.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.991
Is like, freaking me the hell out.

20:21.992 --> 20:24.094
- You need to take a minute?
- Yeah.

20:24.095 --> 20:25.825
Okay.

20:25.826 --> 20:29.158
I've never walked away from
an investigation out of fear.

20:29.159 --> 20:32.674
But this house is unlike
anything I've ever encountered.

20:32.675 --> 20:37.556
It's taking everything I've got to
stop myself from running out the door.

20:37.557 --> 20:42.297
This is just a really
negative, scary place.

20:49.097 --> 20:51.952
I seriously feel like somebody's
strangling the [Bleep] out of me.

20:51.953 --> 20:57.853
Like somebody's smothering me,
putting their hand on my face.

21:04.247 --> 21:08.016
Wow, this is, like, not cool, man.

21:08.017 --> 21:12.407
I just feel really frickin' nauseous
there from all the energy in that...

21:12.408 --> 21:13.977
In the house.

21:13.978 --> 21:18.982
It's, like, going through my body,
like, physically pushing on my body.

21:18.983 --> 21:22.163
And it was hurting me.

21:24.485 --> 21:27.357
I'm, like... I'm just in shock right now.

21:27.358 --> 21:29.326
You got blindsided.

21:29.327 --> 21:32.479
The other thing I did
get was a poltergeist.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.920
Coming from a living agent in the house.

21:37.149 --> 21:40.003
After I got outside and away
from the shadow people,

21:40.004 --> 21:43.168
I also felt the presence of a poltergeist.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.869
What most people don't know,

21:44.870 --> 21:48.908
is that poltergeists are created
by the living, not the dead.

21:48.909 --> 21:54.184
When someone with psychic abilities
represses trauma or negative emotions.

21:54.185 --> 21:57.587
That negativity can materialize
into a poltergeist,

21:57.588 --> 22:01.382
which can cause serious harm to people.

22:01.383 --> 22:05.538
Is there anybody that you can
help as far as all this going on?

22:05.539 --> 22:08.648
Well, I mean, the first thing that
I have to try to figure out is

22:08.649 --> 22:11.883
if it's the current residents
that are doing this.

22:11.884 --> 22:16.449
If they're the culprits, then
we've got a big [Bleep] problem.

22:16.450 --> 22:19.390
Because with that...

22:20.484 --> 22:24.864
They could be bringing it on themselves.

22:41.969 --> 22:45.772
The other thing I did
get was a poltergeist.

22:45.773 --> 22:48.913
So the first thing that I
have to try to figure out is

22:48.914 --> 22:52.312
if it's the current residents
that are doing this.

22:52.313 --> 22:58.213
If they're the culprits, then
we've got a big [Bleep] problem.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.407
Everyone in this family
has the exact same story,

23:02.408 --> 23:04.891
and I'm convinced they're
all telling me the truth.

23:04.892 --> 23:08.857
Now I got to find out if the problem
existed before the family moved in.

23:08.858 --> 23:11.688
So I asked the last owner of
the property to meet with me.

23:11.689 --> 23:14.458
- How are you? I'm Steve.
- Nice to meet you, Steve.

23:14.459 --> 23:17.287
I understand you used to live here.
You actually grew up in this house?

23:17.288 --> 23:18.615
Yeah, born and raised here.

23:18.616 --> 23:20.778
- And you lived here till how old?
- Twenty one.

23:20.779 --> 23:24.748
When you lived here, did you ever
experience any strange things in the house?

23:24.749 --> 23:27.949
No, not really, no. My
sister and I, neither one.

23:27.950 --> 23:29.954
- Okay, so you lived here with your sister?
- Yeah.

23:29.955 --> 23:31.689
- And your parents, obviously.
- Yes.

23:31.690 --> 23:35.221
- Did they ever mention anything to you?
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.

23:35.222 --> 23:36.984
Do you know the family that lives here now?

23:36.985 --> 23:38.531
Yes, we sold them the property.

23:38.532 --> 23:40.215
You don't think they're crazy or anything?

23:40.216 --> 23:41.450
No, not that I know.

23:41.451 --> 23:44.879
Okay, so to you, they're just
a normal American family.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.600
- Far as I know, yes.
- Okay.

23:51.457 --> 23:53.744
I can't exactly investigate shadows.

23:53.745 --> 23:56.379
I need something concrete,
so I look into the house,

23:56.380 --> 24:01.240
and there's not much in
its 70-year history.

24:01.341 --> 24:03.463
There are only two deaths
that I can find...

24:03.464 --> 24:07.467
The father of the previous
owner, who died in 1963.

24:07.468 --> 24:11.044
And Laura and Joe's father, who
died of a heart condition in 2003.

24:11.045 --> 24:16.565
But neither of these deaths
even happened in the house.

24:28.545 --> 24:31.663
Well, I feel like somebody died in here.

24:31.664 --> 24:34.964
Someone committed suicide.

24:34.984 --> 24:38.824
Somebody, like, gassed themselves.

24:41.224 --> 24:47.124
This is a male, but I also see a
little boy on a... on the car seat.

24:48.811 --> 24:52.422
They're both white, he
has short brown hair...

24:52.423 --> 24:54.713
And it's wavy.

24:54.714 --> 24:56.339
Its summer. It's a long time ago.

24:56.340 --> 24:59.324
My heart's pounding.

24:59.325 --> 25:02.205
They're both dead.

25:04.320 --> 25:08.089
I widen my search to include the
neighbor's farmland close to the house.

25:08.090 --> 25:12.230
And then I find something from 1962.

25:16.393 --> 25:18.793
Oh, my God.

25:19.230 --> 25:22.494
- Oh, God.
- What's wrong?

25:22.495 --> 25:27.771
I just felt dizzy in my head.
It's my ears. Just...

25:27.772 --> 25:30.532
Death, uh, dying.

25:30.975 --> 25:33.711
My head, like, really...

25:33.712 --> 25:35.992
Feels bad.

25:37.284 --> 25:40.464
That's it. That's it.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.926
Okay.

26:03.315 --> 26:05.745
I know nothing about the
residents in this house,

26:05.746 --> 26:10.351
and I never want to
contaminate an investigation.

26:10.352 --> 26:13.559
But in this case, I really
need to speak with Steve.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.782
Someone who lives here is either
creating this poltergeist,

26:16.783 --> 26:20.065
or is in danger of being harmed by it.

26:20.066 --> 26:24.566
Steve agrees to arrange a private meeting.

26:29.475 --> 26:32.748
Have you had any experiences
in this location?

26:32.749 --> 26:35.556
Since my husband passed, I've seen, like...

26:35.557 --> 26:38.417
A shadow or something, but
just catches your eye.

26:38.418 --> 26:44.001
It doesn't stay there. It just goes away.
It doesn't... it doesn't bother me.

26:44.002 --> 26:48.606
What about your husband? Did he ever
have any experiences that you know of?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.675
Well, I guess he's seen what my kids seen.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.344
- Really? Okay.
- Some of it, yeah.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.254
I felt that the residents of this house

26:55.255 --> 26:57.638
were seeing the same
shadow people that I saw.

26:57.639 --> 26:59.884
Which tells me that they
could all have abilities,

26:59.885 --> 27:03.421
and any one of them is capable
of creating a poltergeist.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.958
Now I need to figure out who's
suppressing their emotional pain.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.864
And creating the poltergeist
that resides here.

27:09.865 --> 27:15.058
Did you ever have any, uh,
traumatic incidents growing up?

27:15.059 --> 27:18.376
Well, my mom had passed
away during my senior year.

27:18.377 --> 27:21.338
- Oh, wow. Okay.
- To me, that was... yeah.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.377
- That was a...
- Going on 18, I don't know.

27:23.378 --> 27:26.127
- I can't remember.
- Okay, all right.

27:26.128 --> 27:26.961
Wow.

27:26.962 --> 27:29.894
She had a brain tumor, and
she died just like that.

27:29.895 --> 27:32.096
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah.

27:32.097 --> 27:33.957
Wow.

27:34.012 --> 27:36.353
- Is your father currently living, or...
- No.

27:36.354 --> 27:38.333
- Okay.
- He committed suicide.

27:38.334 --> 27:40.614
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.582
Hung himself.

27:42.583 --> 27:45.719
- So that was also traumatic for you.
- Yeah.

27:45.720 --> 27:49.214
I didn't know that, um, there
was a lot of problems there.

27:49.215 --> 27:54.268
I thought maybe if I'd have known, I
could've probably saved him, but he passed.

27:54.269 --> 27:57.549
Wow, so that's... that's very traumatizing.

27:57.550 --> 28:01.854
That's, you know, you get over it, though.
You just got to keep going on.

28:01.855 --> 28:05.338
Lorraine has endured some
very traumatic losses.

28:05.339 --> 28:09.283
And it seems to me she's dealt with
them by repressing her emotions.

28:09.284 --> 28:12.729
You're obviously concerned
about your children,

28:12.730 --> 28:17.430
and how these experiences
are affecting them.

28:17.431 --> 28:20.131
Yeah, because I never seen Laura
look like that, you know?

28:20.132 --> 28:22.782
And Joe, I didn't think
he would be that bad.

28:22.783 --> 28:25.003
That's...

28:25.276 --> 28:27.700
There's got to be something in
here doing it, I don't know.

28:27.701 --> 28:31.871
Sometimes it's only about understanding

28:31.872 --> 28:35.558
what's going on, and then knowing
what you can do about it.

28:35.559 --> 28:36.358
Yeah.

28:36.359 --> 28:40.514
And then you can actually be proactive
and take care of the situation.

28:40.515 --> 28:44.625
So that's what hopefully
we'll be able to do here.

28:44.626 --> 28:48.826
Do you feel that it can be resolved?

28:50.356 --> 28:52.726
How do they resolve it?

28:52.727 --> 28:56.212
Well, there's techniques
that they can learn...

28:56.213 --> 28:58.009
- Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
- To kind of shut it down.

28:58.010 --> 29:02.514
How do you feel that you protect yourself?

29:02.515 --> 29:05.755
I don't believe in it.

29:06.405 --> 29:09.253
You know, I may... I'd
have to really have to...

29:09.254 --> 29:13.395
I just don't... I won't let...
I won't believe it.

29:13.396 --> 29:17.311
Well, I've always been thankful, you
know, that my kids were always healthy.

29:17.312 --> 29:18.293
Mm-hmm.

29:18.294 --> 29:21.192
I felt like God blessed
me, you know, not to,

29:21.193 --> 29:23.184
take away anything away from me again,

29:23.185 --> 29:25.612
because I miss my mother and
father, you know? So...

29:25.613 --> 29:26.493
Right.

29:26.494 --> 29:30.842
That's why I feel I was blessed because the
thing was really seriously wrong with it.

29:30.843 --> 29:33.794
Lorraine has seen these
things with her own eyes.

29:33.795 --> 29:36.775
But she's still in denial
about their existence.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.529
And that's the problem.

29:38.530 --> 29:40.820
Repressed emotions are
not going to eliminate

29:40.821 --> 29:43.723
poltergeists or shadow
people from her home.

29:43.724 --> 29:47.264
It could make them stronger.

29:56.336 --> 29:59.054
I did not want to go back into this house,

29:59.055 --> 30:02.687
but I really need to find out
what Steve has uncovered.

30:02.688 --> 30:07.191
I also need to sit face-to-face with
Lorraine's kids, and only her kids.

30:07.192 --> 30:13.092
I don't think Lorraine's ready
to hear what I have to say.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.103
Well, hi, guys. It's good to see you again.

30:18.104 --> 30:19.771
I want to introduce you to Amy.

30:19.772 --> 30:22.243
Amy, this is Laura, and this is Joseph.

30:22.244 --> 30:26.019
They were both born and raised in this
house, and they called us in to...

30:26.020 --> 30:28.329
Try to give them some answers
as to what's going on here.

30:28.330 --> 30:32.550
What I'd like to do is start by
having Amy talk about her walk.

30:32.551 --> 30:36.921
The first thing I want to talk
about is in the garage area.

30:36.922 --> 30:42.822
It seemed to be either a double
suicide or a murder/suicide.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.810
Well, I feel like somebody died in here.

30:46.811 --> 30:50.111
Someone committed suicide.

30:50.202 --> 30:53.772
Somebody, like, gassed themselves.

30:53.773 --> 30:59.673
This is a male, but I also see a
little boy on a... on the car seat.

30:59.679 --> 31:02.284
They're both dead.

31:02.285 --> 31:06.785
There was gas involved. He gassed himself.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.815
See, the thing is with Amy, she picks
things up and she'll say something,

31:11.816 --> 31:15.167
and I'll remember an article
or some interview I've done.

31:15.168 --> 31:18.738
That'll bring clarity to the
information that she gets.

31:18.739 --> 31:24.639
I actually I have an article when I was
doing my research back in August of '62.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.213
It's summer. It's a long time ago.

31:27.214 --> 31:29.115
My heart's pounding.

31:29.116 --> 31:33.567
A guy killed himself and his 6-year-old
son by, uh, asphyxiation in the truck.

31:33.568 --> 31:39.468
He hooked up the gas pipe into the cab of
the truck, killed himself and his son.

31:40.827 --> 31:43.587
Death, uh, dying.

31:43.764 --> 31:46.500
My head, like, really...

31:46.501 --> 31:48.781
Feels bad.

31:49.907 --> 31:54.539
This happened within the area right
here, very close to where we are.

31:54.540 --> 31:57.295
I guess that's probably what you picked up.

31:57.296 --> 31:59.156
Wow.

32:00.380 --> 32:04.951
And, Amy, you found this outside in
the garage when you did your walk?

32:04.952 --> 32:06.812
Yes.

32:07.594 --> 32:11.057
Normally, I would feel validated
by the article that Steve found,

32:11.058 --> 32:14.044
but I'm focused on the
bigger issue right now.

32:14.045 --> 32:18.613
I want to make sure that Laura and Joe
get the answers they are looking for.

32:18.614 --> 32:22.630
This case is unlike any of
the other cases we've done.

32:22.631 --> 32:25.247
So I just want to make sure you
still want to go forward with the

32:25.248 --> 32:27.679
information we're gonna give you
because it's very sensitive,

32:27.680 --> 32:29.986
and it's very scary.

32:29.987 --> 32:31.877
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

32:31.878 --> 32:36.198
Amy, if you can continue about your walk...

32:36.199 --> 32:39.323
So I came into the house.

32:39.324 --> 32:42.605
And upstairs, in the bedroom areas...

32:42.606 --> 32:47.106
I encountered five different shadow people.

32:50.596 --> 32:54.800
- So they're present?
- I feel like they're present now.

32:54.801 --> 32:57.501
They're, like...

32:57.651 --> 32:59.931
Watching...

33:00.862 --> 33:03.712
Which I don't like.

33:03.713 --> 33:06.679
They were coming and going
through the closets.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.984
They interacted with people
who were in the household.

33:10.985 --> 33:13.834
Typically when they would
be in bed at night.

33:13.835 --> 33:19.715
And they were basically causing
harm to the individuals here.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.963
In a location, I've only
ever encountered one,

33:23.964 --> 33:29.668
so to be in a household where there
were five really disturbed me.

33:29.669 --> 33:33.065
I'm actually terrified of these things.

33:33.066 --> 33:38.011
And I've had my own experience
with them when I was a child.

33:38.012 --> 33:41.451
It was actually my first
memory of an experience...

33:41.452 --> 33:42.972
Was with shadow people.

33:42.973 --> 33:45.997
And they actually tried to kill me.

33:45.998 --> 33:51.541
They influenced me to bite my electrical
cord, and I was electrocuted.

33:51.542 --> 33:54.861
That's when I also kind of figured
out that they were not good.

33:54.862 --> 33:58.579
Because initially, they tried
to say that they were good

33:58.580 --> 34:00.366
and they wanted me to come with them.

34:00.367 --> 34:05.107
So I do find these
entities very horrifying.

34:06.675 --> 34:12.574
I'd like Laura and Joseph to tell you what
happened to them when they were kids.

34:12.833 --> 34:17.612
I spent the majority of my
childhood in this room up here.

34:17.614 --> 34:19.366
Every night, before I'd go to bed,

34:19.367 --> 34:23.266
I'd always feel something on me.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.069
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

34:29.070 --> 34:34.550
And I've actually seen this black
smoke in my room go up the wall.

34:34.551 --> 34:37.735
I would always feel like,
um, I couldn't breathe.

34:37.737 --> 34:39.803
I was just paralyzed where I couldn't move.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.705
I mean, it's fascinating
that you're saying that

34:41.706 --> 34:44.110
there's actually these figures
because I've seen them.

34:44.110 --> 34:48.230
I've had very similar situations
happen to me very frequently

34:48.231 --> 34:51.516
as a kid, and it started as
soon as I could remember.

34:51.518 --> 34:52.956
Even before I could remember,

34:52.958 --> 34:57.141
I was told that I would sleepwalk,
I would speak in Tongues.

34:57.143 --> 35:01.211
And it was all driving from when I
was sleeping in my room upstairs.

35:01.212 --> 35:02.693
Sleepwalking and sleep-talking,

35:02.694 --> 35:08.594
that's typically them interacting
with us while we're asleep.

35:10.137 --> 35:12.572
So where do these shadow people come from?

35:12.573 --> 35:15.580
Were they in the house here already,
or did they come from somewhere else?

35:15.581 --> 35:21.481
Well, unfortunately, there's not a lot
known about where they come from.

35:22.100 --> 35:27.935
We think that they are attracted to
locations of people who have abilities.

35:27.936 --> 35:30.923
Of people who are vulnerable...

35:30.924 --> 35:33.480
And that there's some type of negativity,

35:33.481 --> 35:36.444
that's attracting them to that location.

35:36.445 --> 35:39.746
They usually go after young children.

35:39.747 --> 35:44.778
Or elderly people or people
who are sick and vulnerable.

35:44.779 --> 35:48.444
And they absolutely were encountering
people in this household

35:48.445 --> 35:49.872
and messing with them.

35:49.873 --> 35:54.242
And I think, in fact, one person
in the household may have been...

35:54.243 --> 35:56.883
Killed by them.

35:59.198 --> 36:02.323
The person that I saw was
a male, an older male.

36:02.324 --> 36:05.730
He was sleeping when I saw him.

36:05.731 --> 36:10.182
And one of the beings was
sucking out his breath.

36:10.183 --> 36:14.569
So I was thinking chest issues,
breathing issues, heart issues...

36:14.570 --> 36:18.106
Things of that nature, that
this thing, over a long term,

36:18.107 --> 36:21.467
was doing to this person.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.246
I hear Soul Reaper.

36:25.247 --> 36:29.173
I feel like it's sucking
out the person's life.

36:29.174 --> 36:32.820
From everything that I've seen on
my walk and heard from this family,

36:32.821 --> 36:35.328
I believe I was seeing their father.

36:35.329 --> 36:37.751
But it's not my place to say.

36:37.752 --> 36:41.463
I think Joe and Laura will talk
about it when they're ready.

36:41.464 --> 36:44.799
When I did the walk of the upstairs...

36:44.800 --> 36:46.766
I'm sorry, it really bothers me.

36:46.767 --> 36:49.107
It's okay.

36:52.060 --> 36:54.257
Do you feel them right now?

36:54.258 --> 36:56.778
A little bit.

37:09.071 --> 37:12.593
When I did the walk of the upstairs...

37:12.594 --> 37:14.862
I'm sorry, it really bothers me.

37:14.863 --> 37:16.909
Do you feel them right now?

37:16.910 --> 37:19.430
A little bit.

37:19.546 --> 37:21.981
Where exactly are you
picking up the energy?

37:21.982 --> 37:24.995
From over in this location.

37:24.996 --> 37:28.013
I was feeling like they
were on the landing.

37:28.014 --> 37:29.864
I kind of wanted to leave.

37:29.865 --> 37:35.763
I just still have a lot of issues of
my own with that from my childhood.

37:35.764 --> 37:37.271
Joe, what's on your mind?

37:37.272 --> 37:40.575
A lot's on my mind. I mean, really,
it's a lot to take in, you know?

37:40.576 --> 37:43.010
It's frightening. It's... it's crazy.

37:43.011 --> 37:46.711
So basically, what you're telling
us, it ain't safe upstairs for...

37:46.712 --> 37:51.054
Kids, for elderly, for anybody that's
maybe vulnerable or have some kind of...

37:51.055 --> 37:52.660
- Illness.
- Weakness or illness.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.877
- It's not safe up there.
- No, it's not safe upstairs.

37:54.878 --> 37:57.278
- And it's not safe downstairs.
- Downstairs?

37:57.279 --> 38:02.397
- The whole downstairs and the basement?
- Yeah, not safe.

38:02.398 --> 38:06.098
To have five in one household is just...
like, boggled my mind.

38:06.099 --> 38:08.187
Like I've never seen that before.

38:08.188 --> 38:11.016
I think that they were attracted...

38:11.017 --> 38:14.827
Probably to the family because it
seems that you all have abilities.

38:14.828 --> 38:18.850
And then, you were young children,
vulnerable, they're attracted to that.

38:18.851 --> 38:22.478
So it was kind of like the perfect storm.

38:22.479 --> 38:26.632
Even though Joe and Laura have encountered
these shadow people personally.

38:26.633 --> 38:29.408
It's still seems hard for them to accept.

38:29.409 --> 38:33.545
This makes me concerned about
what I have to tell them next.

38:33.546 --> 38:39.008
So the next thing that I encountered
was a poltergeist entity.

38:39.009 --> 38:43.192
And the thing about poltergeists
is that it's not...

38:43.193 --> 38:45.649
Like the movie poltergeist.

38:45.650 --> 38:50.030
A poltergeist stems from a living agent.

38:51.388 --> 38:55.309
So it's somebody who
resides at the location.

38:55.310 --> 38:58.356
And what happens is...

38:58.357 --> 39:04.036
Typically, it's an individual who
has repressed their emotions.

39:04.037 --> 39:07.149
They tend to keep it bottled
up and pushed down.

39:07.150 --> 39:12.459
And what can end up happening is that
that emotion that's been bottled up...

39:12.460 --> 39:17.229
Comes out in a manner of affecting
their physical surroundings.

39:17.230 --> 39:22.221
Via this electricity or this energy
that can come from the body.

39:22.222 --> 39:28.122
That's basically what a poltergeist
is, from a living person.

39:29.432 --> 39:32.140
I did speak to your mother yesterday.

39:32.141 --> 39:35.141
I did interview her.

39:35.618 --> 39:38.334
I know where that's going.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.702
I'm sorry, I...

39:39.703 --> 39:44.443
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
- I can see...

39:45.112 --> 39:47.154
It's something that's subconscious.

39:47.155 --> 39:50.460
It's not something that the
person is aware they're doing.

39:50.461 --> 39:53.130
It's not something that
the person wants to do.

39:53.131 --> 39:55.365
It's just simply something that happens

39:55.366 --> 39:58.161
to someone who has gone
through emotional traumas,

39:58.162 --> 40:02.372
who has learned to repress
their emotions, as a safety.

40:02.373 --> 40:07.773
It's just something that can
be a natural occurrence.

40:09.111 --> 40:12.210
So basically anybody can
carry this kind of energy?

40:12.211 --> 40:16.304
Not anybody um, it's usually
people with ability's.

40:16.305 --> 40:19.158
I try to help people by
telling them what I see.

40:19.159 --> 40:21.093
But I can't always make things better.

40:21.094 --> 40:23.781
Sometimes they have to
do that for themselves.

40:23.782 --> 40:25.897
Obviously mom's not here with us tonight.

40:25.898 --> 40:30.007
But I'm just curious, are you guys going
to share any of this information with her?

40:30.008 --> 40:34.252
I think I will, I'll try to explain
what a poltergeist can be.

40:34.253 --> 40:39.141
But I don't think it's her, I think
it could be, something else.

40:39.142 --> 40:42.982
I don't think it could be her.

40:43.079 --> 40:46.291
We're just coming in here to
give you what we found out.

40:46.292 --> 40:48.692
Basically on this case
mostly what Amy found out.

40:48.693 --> 40:51.212
We wouldn't be doing our jobs if
we didn't tell you everything.

40:51.213 --> 40:53.595
- Of course, I understand that.
- Right.

40:53.596 --> 40:57.412
It can't be easy for Joe and
Laura to process my findings.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.461
But the most important part of my job,

40:59.462 --> 41:03.366
no matter how difficult it may
be is to be honest with them.

41:03.367 --> 41:06.405
You know if it is possible
that that's the case.

41:06.406 --> 41:09.408
What are some things we can
do to remedy that situation?

41:09.409 --> 41:12.365
The best thing is just for her to talk.

41:12.366 --> 41:15.569
You know really talk out her emotions.

41:15.570 --> 41:20.297
And talk out that energy, and for her
to release verbally, or in writing...

41:20.298 --> 41:23.324
The things that she's been through,
things that she's experienced,

41:23.325 --> 41:25.321
and have that emotional outlet.

41:25.322 --> 41:27.436
In a safe way.

41:27.437 --> 41:30.335
This a lot of information for you
guys to absorb in a couple of hours,

41:30.336 --> 41:32.227
so I mean what do you think Joe?

41:32.228 --> 41:34.141
Well, if anything it's validating for me.

41:34.142 --> 41:35.926
People probably think
I'm still a little off.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.901
But you know once you
experience something this,

41:37.902 --> 41:40.089
it open's your eyes, and you see something.

41:40.090 --> 41:44.120
I mean it's hard to deny something
that's happened so many times to me.

41:44.121 --> 41:47.206
Amy always tells our
clients the same thing.

41:47.207 --> 41:49.455
- You have to take control.
- Big time.

41:49.456 --> 41:52.702
Obviously as a family we have a lot of
things we need to consider, and think about

41:52.703 --> 41:54.343
for the future here.

41:54.344 --> 41:56.257
But it's defiantly stuff that we've heard.

41:56.258 --> 41:57.830
We're gonna have that conversation,

41:57.831 --> 42:00.211
we're going to move forward
here, we're a strong family and

42:00.212 --> 42:01.748
we're going to work through this.

42:01.749 --> 42:05.745
No one knows where shadow people come from,
so no one knows how to get rid of them.

42:05.746 --> 42:08.745
But we do know that they're
drawn to negative emotions.

42:08.746 --> 42:12.130
Lorraine has experienced a
lot of tragedy in her life.

42:12.131 --> 42:16.021
And I hope that Joe's right, that
as a family they can pull together,

42:16.022 --> 42:18.751
and create a more positive
environment for Lorraine.

42:18.752 --> 42:22.437
But personally, I would leave
this house and never come back.
