WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:03.404
Jimmy, when's the landlord
coming to get the new lease?

00:03.504 --> 00:04.938
CARL: Landlord.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.707
Uh, I think sometime
this morning?

00:06.807 --> 00:08.076
We're not ready
for him.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.078
I don't know. We covered
all the holes with bad art

00:10.178 --> 00:12.180
and creative furniture
placement.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.115
I don't see any
major lease violations.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.719
What do you think,
major lease violation?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.921
Well, hide him.

00:21.021 --> 00:21.922
Come here, Pepper.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.258
Come here.
Come here!

00:25.659 --> 00:28.396
Is this how people feel when
they ask me to do things?

00:28.496 --> 00:30.030
-Yep.
-Mm.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.901
Mother of...

00:34.001 --> 00:34.768
MAYA:
We'll be right there!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.570
Fetch!

00:36.670 --> 00:38.106
Lazy millennials.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.942
How...?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.544
MAYA:
Come on, Pepper.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.778
Come on.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.913
Yes!

00:46.013 --> 00:47.815
Oh, so sorry, won't you
please come in?

00:47.915 --> 00:49.817
You sign
the new lease?
Yes.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.752
Enjoy your year.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.789
How did you get out?
Where's Dylan?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.292
DYLAN:
He locked me in here!

00:58.392 --> 01:00.228
Well played, darling.

01:00.328 --> 01:04.165
**

01:05.999 --> 01:08.302
I have some dumb
journalism project

01:08.402 --> 01:09.470
for stupid
English class

01:09.570 --> 01:11.339
where I have to interview
a family member.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.107
Mom, what's
Grandpa's number?

01:13.774 --> 01:15.976
Dylan, your mother
hasn't talked to her father

01:16.076 --> 01:17.478
in 20 years.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.513
Okay. I'll just
interview the dog then.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.781
Wait, how do you
not know that?

01:20.881 --> 01:21.749
Has it never
crossed your mind

01:21.849 --> 01:23.417
that you've not once
met the man?

01:23.517 --> 01:26.019
And don't you want to know
why she hasn't spoken to him

01:26.120 --> 01:27.288
in 20 years?

01:27.388 --> 01:29.457
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and suggest

01:29.557 --> 01:31.592
that journalism is not
in your future.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.129
Dylan...my father and I
were once very close,

01:35.229 --> 01:36.530
but that all changed when

01:36.630 --> 01:38.332
I returned home
from America in 1998

01:38.432 --> 01:41.202
with the love of my life,
Jimmy DiMeo.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.870
My father didn't approve.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.805
He said that if
we were to get married,

01:44.905 --> 01:46.140
he would never
speak to me again.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.308
So I looked him
in the eye

01:47.408 --> 01:50.678
and I said something that
I never thought I'd say --

01:50.778 --> 01:53.947
Cool, I think I have enough
for my project now. Thanks.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.850
Dylan, my heart
is breaking over Taylor.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.687
Let a boy listen
to his mother's love story.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.555
I said to my father --

02:01.655 --> 02:04.358
"Goodbye forever."

02:04.458 --> 02:05.893
Painful? Yes.

02:05.993 --> 02:09.463
But right and good
because, you know,

02:09.563 --> 02:11.999
that is what
I strive to be.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.133
(construction machinery
whirring, grinding)

02:13.234 --> 02:15.236
If those bloody neighbors
don't shut up,

02:15.336 --> 02:16.837
I'm gonna go over there
and eat their children!

02:16.937 --> 02:19.173
They're not supposed to start
construction for an hour.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.342
Do you know what?
Someone's got to go over
there and talk to them,

02:21.442 --> 02:22.743
and that somebody
has got to be

02:22.843 --> 02:24.312
diplomatic.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.246
Who's it gonna be?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.880
Rock, paper, scissors,
shoot.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.482
I left my country
for you.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.418
And that beats scissors.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.986
MR. POWERS:
Ladies and gentlemen,
to announce the winner

02:33.086 --> 02:35.523
of our annual
Weekend Film Challenge --

02:35.623 --> 02:38.392
Mr. Powers and...

02:38.492 --> 02:40.528
Mr. Powers!

02:40.628 --> 02:43.564
Nice tie.
Where'd you get it?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.833
Uh, there.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.737
Class, you've all read
each other's scripts and voted.

02:49.837 --> 02:53.874
The winner now gets
to direct his or her film

02:53.974 --> 02:55.943
to be screened
for the student body

02:56.043 --> 02:57.611
with the unlimited
resources

02:57.711 --> 03:01.349
of the entire Lafayette High
Film Department!

03:01.449 --> 03:03.851
AKA, $10.
Oh, you!

03:03.951 --> 03:06.086
That's all we need.
Two of this guy.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.521
Hey, can we keep
the chatter down?

03:07.621 --> 03:09.857
Whoa.
Okay, I'm on board.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.392
And the winner is...

03:11.492 --> 03:14.295
Ahhhh...

03:14.395 --> 03:15.529
JJ DiMeo!

03:16.864 --> 03:19.132
I read for that guy!

03:19.233 --> 03:21.201
"Whoa, I won?"

03:21.302 --> 03:22.703
That's awesome, JJ.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.272
Can I be
your assistant director?

03:24.372 --> 03:25.706
Quiet on set!

03:25.806 --> 03:28.309
I guess that's better than you
quoting movies all day.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.610
I'm the king of the world!

03:29.710 --> 03:33.647
We will be shooting JJ's
short horror film

03:33.747 --> 03:34.982
The Hall.

03:35.082 --> 03:39.052
Winner, here is our class's
director's megaphone.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.256
Oh.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.292
Actually, JJ may not
have much use for this.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.159
Just run on up here
and grab it.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.628
He can't!
Stop it!

03:47.728 --> 03:50.331
Now, let me hear you yell,
"Action"!
Stop it!

03:50.431 --> 03:53.467
Aw, you can yell it
louder than that!

03:53.567 --> 03:55.102
I did not
think this through.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.970
Oh...

03:57.070 --> 03:58.672
Mom's memory box.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.775
Looks like someone was bitten
by the family-history bug.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.644
Please. I just need
a visual aid

04:03.744 --> 04:06.179
for my dumb
journalism project.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.949
Their wedding video.
Done.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.151
Wait, where's the screen
on this sucker?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.322
You put it in the machine
and press play.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.525
Journalism is so hard!

04:21.795 --> 04:25.499
There's
my handsome groom.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.535
Oh, I love you.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.802
Huh?

04:28.902 --> 04:29.870
That isn't Dad.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.540
MAYA:
Dylan, go and walk Pepper!

04:32.640 --> 04:34.342
Just a sec!
Now!

04:35.943 --> 04:37.210
Come on, Pepper!

04:39.780 --> 04:40.681
MAYA: Dylan?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.384
Where's the tape?
What tape?

04:43.484 --> 04:46.320
I thought it was you and Dad's
wedding tape, but it wasn't.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.456
Did you take it?
Huh?

04:48.556 --> 04:49.990
I thought you were supposed
to walk Pepper.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.660
I-I just did.
Well, do it again.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.562
Look at him,
he's bursting with energy.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.873
**

05:05.973 --> 05:07.140
She knows.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.876
(to tune of "For He's
a Jolly Good Fellow")

05:08.976 --> 05:11.011
MAYA AND JIMMY:
* For he's a jolly
promising director *

05:11.111 --> 05:13.714
* Who owes it all
to his mom *
* Who owes it all
to his dad *

05:13.814 --> 05:15.248
Guess you didn't read my text
about JJ asking

05:15.349 --> 05:16.750
we no make this
a big deal.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.586
Not a big deal?
Read you texts?

05:18.686 --> 05:22.189
It's a tremendous deal.
Aren't you so excited?

05:22.990 --> 05:26.427
"Of course, but it's
a student film

05:26.527 --> 05:29.930
made by
a nonverbal director.

05:30.030 --> 05:33.200
Let's keep the bar low."
Can I be in it?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.603
"Not that low."

05:35.703 --> 05:37.505
Look, I'm dying for a way
to win Taylor back.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.939
If I can be
the star of a movie,

05:39.039 --> 05:41.542
say something badass,
save the day...

05:41.642 --> 05:43.944
"Dead body. Face down."
Yes!

05:44.044 --> 05:45.379
Do you have a role
for your dad?

05:45.479 --> 05:47.681
More noise
from the neighbors!

05:47.781 --> 05:49.082
I thought you said
you talked to them.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.217
Are you kidding me?

05:50.317 --> 05:52.886
I went right over there
the second we spoke.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.555
Yeah, don't cast me.
I can't act.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.224
Eddie, d-do you have
a second?

05:57.324 --> 05:58.392
Hey. Sorry.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.927
Guys, can we
hold the work, please?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.762
Torbjorn!

06:01.862 --> 06:03.864
This is gonna sound
really bad by the way,

06:03.964 --> 06:06.366
but if you're ever hiring
workers, don't hire Norwegian.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.735
What's up?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.202
Well, I'm actually here about
the construction noise.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.271
It's going on all hours.
Oh.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.706
Jimmy, oh my gosh,
I'm so sorry.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.307
I-I think these guys are
so used to Arctic sun hours

06:14.408 --> 06:16.243
that someone needs to remind
them they're working

06:16.343 --> 06:17.478
below the 66th parallel!

06:17.578 --> 06:19.413
It won't happen again.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.881
-Great. Thanks.
-All right.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.083
Are these, uh, the plans
for the addition?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.284
You mind
if I take a look?
Sure.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.553
You know anything
about this stuff?

06:25.653 --> 06:27.921
A little. I-I went
to school for architecture.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.591
A-And it looks like
Torbjorn

06:30.691 --> 06:32.426
is pouring foundational concrete
for a wall...

06:32.526 --> 06:34.161
...where the skylight's
supposed to go.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.430
Really?
Dang it, Torbjorn!

06:36.530 --> 06:38.832
That work took you
tre timer!

06:38.932 --> 06:40.267
Thanks, Jimbo.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.102
Hey, would you mind
taking a look at the rest
of these plans?

06:42.202 --> 06:43.904
Ah, that's not really
a good idea.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.238
I came here
to stop the work.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.306
I'm really
out of my element.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.141
I-I could use
an architect's eye on this.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.409
**

06:49.510 --> 06:50.911
Architect's eye?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.813
Well, no one's
ever called my eye

06:52.913 --> 06:54.482
an architect's eye before.
Uh...

06:54.582 --> 06:57.150
Okay!
All right!
Thank you so much.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.952
Yeah, it turns out neighbors
aren't just for stealing cable.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.688
What's that?
Let's do this!
Okay.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.090
Silence, everyone.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.758
Our director
has arrived.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.960
JJ, I got
to thinking about

07:07.060 --> 07:08.829
how we could better adapt
to your needs.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.930
So, for starters,

07:10.030 --> 07:11.431
we know
how important it is

07:11.532 --> 07:13.501
for a director to be able
to express himself,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.969
so we made you

07:16.069 --> 07:18.806
a custom
communication board.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.009
Yeah, with phrases
like "lights," "camera,"

07:22.109 --> 07:23.611
and "Great take,
Mr. Powers!"

07:23.711 --> 07:26.547
No pressure, just if.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.381
"This is so thoughtful.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.517
Thank you."

07:29.617 --> 07:31.318
That's not all.
Wireless monitors

07:31.418 --> 07:34.287
so you can watch the camera feed
from your chair.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.523
Brand-new
editing software

07:35.623 --> 07:37.858
that can be controlled
with eye movement.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.627
I mean...

07:39.727 --> 07:44.464
"Wow. Guess my movie
better be good."

07:44.565 --> 07:45.666
Not done!
Everyone!

07:45.766 --> 07:46.834
YOUNG MAN:
Hey, JJ.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.402
When word got out
that you were taking this on,

07:49.503 --> 07:51.171
a few more people
wanted to help

07:51.271 --> 07:52.906
in any way
that they could.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.175
Now nothing
will stop you

07:55.275 --> 07:58.378
from sharing your brilliant
vision with the world.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.580
So...

08:00.681 --> 08:02.516
...what is it?

08:02.616 --> 08:07.320
**

08:11.158 --> 08:14.227
KENNETH: Dead guy. Face down.
Good rehearsal.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.362
JJ!

08:15.462 --> 08:16.764
Time for the big shoot!

08:16.864 --> 08:18.365
Hey.
Oh...

08:18.465 --> 08:20.000
What happened to you?

08:20.100 --> 08:23.203
"I didn't sleep
last night."

08:23.303 --> 08:24.437
Yeah, probably
too many brilliant ideas

08:24.538 --> 08:25.573
popping around
in your head.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.441
"I had to puke
four times."

08:28.542 --> 08:30.944
Man, your process
fascinates me.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.880
Let's go!

08:32.980 --> 08:34.214
Dead guy, you want a ride
to the set?

08:34.314 --> 08:35.348
Yes, please.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.417
That was a test.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.386
Do you want a ride?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.422
Suit yourself.
No ride.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.292
No, guys, I was just kidding!
I'm coming!

08:45.392 --> 08:46.627
Don't leave without me!

08:46.727 --> 08:48.896
Dylan, I think I found the tape
you're looking for.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.099
Yes, that's it!
Put it in.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.536
Oh, look at that.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.772
It was just my wedding video
all along.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.207
No, I-I don't think
that's it.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.242
I think you were wearing
a different dress.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.713
Oh, and you were all over
this guy with silver hair.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.247
Let me look
at the tape.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.082
You are confused, Dylan.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.218
Let's just put this to bed,
shall we?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.988
You're right, Mom.
It's the same tape.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.590
It i the same tape.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.658
**

09:18.859 --> 09:20.828
**

09:20.928 --> 09:24.732
From now on,
we sleep in shifts.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.934
I call nights.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.302
You're blowing your southern
exposure on a foundational wall.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.672
So I flipped the whole thing,
regraded the hill,

09:31.772 --> 09:33.273
and saved you some room
for a gazebo.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.642
Wow, Jimbo!

09:34.742 --> 09:35.843
Yeah, I was just
having some fun.

09:35.943 --> 09:36.977
I looked over
your original plans.

09:37.077 --> 09:37.978
They're good to go.

09:38.078 --> 09:38.979
Are you kidding me?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.347
We're going with
the gazebo plan.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.115
Are you serious? You want to do
the thing I designed?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.150
Heck, yeah.
What else you got?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.852
Well, before I landed on
the gazebo,

09:44.952 --> 09:46.820
I drew up some ideas for
some different additions.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.021
Uh, a guest house,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.157
uh, maybe a Japanese
rock garden...

09:50.257 --> 09:52.125
I mean, obviously you don't have
room for all of this.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.126
I love my architect!

09:53.226 --> 09:54.995
I love being called
an architect!

09:55.095 --> 09:55.963
-Ha-ha!

10:02.269 --> 10:05.505
AARON: "And action
on rehearsal."

10:08.108 --> 10:09.042
Aah!

10:09.142 --> 10:11.178
Go! Go! Go!

10:12.612 --> 10:14.447
He's killing everyone!

10:16.283 --> 10:19.119
Aah! No!

10:21.288 --> 10:22.890
MR. POWERS: And...

10:25.759 --> 10:29.296
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand--

10:29.396 --> 10:31.364
"Cut!"

10:31.464 --> 10:33.633
Any thoughts, JJ?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.002
"I don't know.

10:35.102 --> 10:39.406
Do any of you
have thoughts?"

10:39.506 --> 10:42.342
Oh. Uh, actually, yeah.
What if we threw in some jokes?

10:42.442 --> 10:44.244
I think that would really
subvert the genre.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.347
Girl: Off that -- I kinda feel
like my character

10:47.447 --> 10:50.818
wouldn't let herself
just...die.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.319
The character
of "Dying Girl"?

10:52.419 --> 10:55.322
RAY:
If we're opening up this box,
one thing Taylor would love --

10:55.422 --> 10:56.857
I've been working
on a character

10:56.957 --> 10:58.358
that's like a James Bond
of today's world --

10:58.458 --> 11:00.493
playboy, but all about
consent.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.729
What's his name?

11:01.829 --> 11:04.397
Um, JJ,
any thoughts?

11:04.497 --> 11:09.602
**

11:09.703 --> 11:12.272
"What's his name?"

11:12.372 --> 11:16.043
**

11:19.112 --> 11:21.548
(The Champs' "Tequila"
plays loudly)

11:21.648 --> 11:24.251
What are you doing?
So no one will hear us.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.886
Yeah, I also
can't hear us.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.120
Something's up with Mom.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.389
I found a video of her
wearing a wedding dress,

11:29.489 --> 11:30.724
but you weren't in it.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.959
Please, you probably
just missed me.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.127
People said I was
the most unremarkable groom

11:34.227 --> 11:35.195
they'd ever seen.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.764
No, she was with
some other guy,

11:36.864 --> 11:39.232
and when I asked her about it,
she got all shifty.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.401
She's hiding something.
I know it.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.702
MAYA: Know what?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.204
**

11:44.304 --> 11:46.774
What's going on
in here?

11:46.874 --> 11:49.877
We were just
having a dance party.

11:49.977 --> 11:50.944
Oh, great.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.880
I love dance parties.

11:52.980 --> 11:53.881
* Tequila

11:56.183 --> 12:00.553
**

12:00.653 --> 12:02.589
**

12:02.689 --> 12:04.925
Oh! Kenneth,
you're right on time.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.827
We're watching a cut
of the scene we shot.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.061
Well, I'm a tough critic.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.897
I almost didn't like
The Emoji Movie.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.398
Ohh.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.599
(television beeps,
video plays)

12:14.367 --> 12:16.169
First try.
Luck.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.971
No. Skill.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.973
Wait. Why was the murder
replaced with sexy banter?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.341
Shh, shh, shh.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.744
Going somewhere?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.413
What's Ray doing
in Maya's raincoat?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.982
But you're --
Then who is --

12:29.082 --> 12:31.819
Nick Mustang.

12:31.919 --> 12:32.953
And I'm his twin.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.287
And we're here
to kick some --

12:34.387 --> 12:35.455
Language!

12:35.555 --> 12:37.757
I mean, come on.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.628
**

12:43.763 --> 12:45.799
Are you comfortable
with this?

12:45.899 --> 12:49.102
You know it,
Nick Mustang.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.770
Ray is playing
two characters?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.539
They catch the killer
in the first scene?

12:52.639 --> 12:54.641
(television beeps,
video stops)
No, this has gone
off the rails.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.309
I need to talk
to the director,

12:56.409 --> 12:57.845
if he's still in there.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.479
Everyone out.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.181
Actually, I'm not sure
you have that sort of
authority over me.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.183
Okay, you know what?
That's fine. That's fine.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.351
Let's move it, people!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.286
**

13:08.621 --> 13:10.190
So we want to be loud,
do we?

13:10.290 --> 13:11.358
Let's be loud!

13:13.827 --> 13:15.028
MAYA: Oi!

13:15.128 --> 13:17.297
My husband has emphasized
multiple times

13:17.397 --> 13:19.833
the importance of keeping
the noise level down!

13:19.933 --> 13:22.002
I will not have
my husband disres--

13:22.102 --> 13:24.171
This thing rocks!

13:24.271 --> 13:25.705
Ha ha -- Oh.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.377
Please kill me with it?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.313
RAY:
And I'm his twin.
And we're here to ki--

13:33.413 --> 13:34.681
(television beeps,
video stops)

13:34.781 --> 13:36.984
Well, that did not get better
with the second viewing.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.751
Is this what
you really wanted?

13:38.886 --> 13:42.222
Okay, that acting is worse
than Rick Mustang.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.591
Nick Mustang.
Who's Rick Mustang?

13:44.691 --> 13:47.060
What happened to the movie
you wanted to make?

13:48.095 --> 13:50.563
RAY:
"It was too hard."

13:50.663 --> 13:53.533
I know they really tried
to set you up for success.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.003
"They did.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.071
That's kind of
the problem.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.573
I had no excuses."

14:00.673 --> 14:02.876
You hate when people
make excuses for you.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.045
**

14:05.145 --> 14:06.213
"I do.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.615
But I guess I like to know
they're there.

14:08.715 --> 14:12.219
Without excuses,
I'm just some guy...

14:12.319 --> 14:14.387
who might suck."

14:14.487 --> 14:15.455
**

14:15.555 --> 14:19.426
"And all these people
believe in me."

14:19.526 --> 14:22.062
**

14:22.162 --> 14:24.864
Hm.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.767
Well, if that's
the problem, uh...

14:27.867 --> 14:29.202
I'll be honest --

14:29.302 --> 14:31.939
I don't think
you can do it.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.108
"Go on."

14:35.208 --> 14:38.912
Well, uh...
I think you're a hack.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.249
I think you need
those excuses.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.951
You

14:44.051 --> 14:45.585
Pfft!
No way.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.088
When the scene ends,
he can't even yell --

14:48.188 --> 14:49.923
"Cut!"

14:50.023 --> 14:52.092
There it is.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.560
So, how about us?

14:53.660 --> 14:54.962
Do, uh,
we get the part of

14:55.062 --> 14:56.563
"Guys who don't
believe in you"?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.266
"Next!"
"Next!"

14:59.366 --> 15:00.667
That's cold, man.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.171
You went over there
to shut them down,

15:04.271 --> 15:05.638
not do architecture
with them.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.307
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm...I'm weak.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.509
Is this the first time?
I mean, how many others
have there been?

15:09.609 --> 15:11.811
The Finns just added
a pool house. Was that you?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.814
This is the first time,
and ...

15:14.914 --> 15:15.983
I loved it.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.018
I miss it, but i-it's over.
It was stupid.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.521
Well, if you love it,
it's not stupid.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.855
How much are they
paying you?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.024
Uh, nothing.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.925
Well, that is stupid.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.629
I think you
should go for it.
What?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.531
Well, you love architecture.
You're good at it.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.832
So do it.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.167
You shouldn't
do it halfway.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.635
You tell that Eddie
if he wants your ideas,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.337
he's got to pay for
your brilliant brain.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.671
You deserve that much.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.010
I never thought
I'd say this, but...

15:43.110 --> 15:44.644
I love you
more than Eddie.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.346
**

15:46.446 --> 15:48.115
Nice wall, Jimmy.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.616
Yeah! I still got it!

15:50.383 --> 15:52.719
I found
more photos of Mom

15:52.819 --> 15:54.554
with that silver-haired man
from the video.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.823
I don't understand.
Who is this guy?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.192
Put some shoes on.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.528
I'm take you for yogurt.
We'll talk.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.696
Okay, now we can talk.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.864
Oh, good.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.499
I love talking.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.834
Mom?

16:07.934 --> 16:10.637
Where's Dad?
He couldn't make it.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.573
But I'm going to take you
to the yogurt place...

16:13.673 --> 16:14.574
and we can talk.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.345
Buckle up.

16:18.445 --> 16:21.848
**

16:21.948 --> 16:23.516
All right, kids,

16:23.616 --> 16:26.553
before we dive
into this scene, a word --

16:26.653 --> 16:28.755
only one voice
matters now.

16:31.491 --> 16:36.429
**

16:36.529 --> 16:41.168
"Get out your"
O-R-- "original scripts.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.671
Anyone have any"
S

16:44.771 --> 16:45.905
Too bad.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.176
Let's make my movie!"

16:51.444 --> 16:53.780
So, darling, I heard
you've been developing

16:53.880 --> 16:56.549
some wild,
crazy theories.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.051
And I wanted
to let you know

16:58.151 --> 17:01.288
what I do
when I'm confused

17:01.388 --> 17:04.391
with wild,
untrue theories.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.726
I forget them.
I --

17:06.826 --> 17:08.261
What are you doing?!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.297
This isn't the way
to the frozen-yogurt place!

17:10.397 --> 17:12.432
Yes, it is! I'm taking you
to the one you love

17:12.532 --> 17:13.533
with all the mix-ins.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.635
Oh, yeah.
I love that place.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.970
What the bloody hell
did you think I was doing?!

17:18.071 --> 17:19.472
I don't know!

17:19.572 --> 17:21.741
All I know is you really
don't want me to know
what's on that tape.

17:21.841 --> 17:22.975
What could be so bad?

17:23.076 --> 17:24.444
Okay.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.412
You're right.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.447
This has gone on
long enough.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.983
I told you a story
about why I don't
speak to my father.

17:31.084 --> 17:35.388
And in it, I was noble
and dignified, and that's --

17:36.089 --> 17:37.157
Well, it's a fantasy.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.591
No more lies.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.760
I had a very complicated
relationship with
your grandfather.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.930
Those two
would get into it, man.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.165
When they
got going it was --

17:45.265 --> 17:46.799
a painful memory.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.067
Be cool, kids.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.669
That video that Dylan found...

17:49.769 --> 17:51.138
it wasn't
our wedding day.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.472
It was actually, uh,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.107
the straw that broke
the camel's back.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.675
So, you didn't
choose love?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.945
No, on that day, I
chose immaturity and
15 killer margaritas.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.284
Ha!

18:04.384 --> 18:06.519
I don't understand.
You said it wasn't your wedding.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.920
No, it was not.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.990
So, you wore a wedding dress
to someone else's wedding?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.293
That's, like,
the worst thing ever.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.961
No, it was not.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.263
-So -- Oh, boy.
-No! I don't want to go!

18:16.363 --> 18:17.530
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!

18:17.630 --> 18:19.766
My father was getting remarried,
and I didn't approve.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.035
I wasn't invited,
and...

18:23.136 --> 18:26.306
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

18:26.406 --> 18:29.176
It was -- It was -- It was
denser than you'd imagine.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.977
I got --

18:31.077 --> 18:32.545
It was a thick cake.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.113
Oh, God. Yep.
That --

18:34.214 --> 18:35.482
That seems like
the right place to stop.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.850
Yeah, my father was very upset.
His wife was furious.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.320
And I've tried over the years
to apologize,

18:40.420 --> 18:42.189
but, uh, nothing.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.358
"But why
lie to us?"

18:45.458 --> 18:47.160
Because I'm ashamed!

18:47.260 --> 18:50.197
My terrible behavior
is the reason

18:50.297 --> 18:52.999
that you don't have
a relationship
with your grandfather.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.468
Maybe it's time
to call him again.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.804
Oh, I don't know.
It's been so bloody long.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.807
Well, maybe
I'm almost ready,

19:00.907 --> 19:04.177
now that it's all out
in the open again.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.346
Thanks to some
crack journalism from Dylan.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.381
Did I blow the lid
off something?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.917
I'm gonna get a "B"!

19:19.359 --> 19:22.061
You have locker 49?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.764
Doesn't everyone with
that locker end up dead?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.098
I'm not worried
about it.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.335
Why isn't she
worried about it?

19:28.435 --> 19:31.604
(dramatic music plays,
girls screaming)

19:31.704 --> 19:33.506
Aah! Aah!

19:33.606 --> 19:34.707
Oh...

19:36.976 --> 19:38.278
No, don't go in there.
Don't go in there!

19:42.782 --> 19:43.883
Oh, no!

19:43.983 --> 19:45.385
Hell, no!

19:45.485 --> 19:48.255
I'm gonna grade this later!
This is crazy!

19:51.023 --> 19:53.293
Clean up
at locker 49...

19:53.393 --> 19:54.427
Dad.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.133
Pretty good, man.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.603
Wow.
Dude, they love it.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.738
"I'll never question

20:05.838 --> 20:08.875
anything I do ever again."

20:08.975 --> 20:11.278
That is not the lesson.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.579
EDDIE:
They also messed this part up,
so we gotta redo --

20:12.679 --> 20:14.281
We actually have
to redo this whole thing.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.248
Jimbo!

20:15.348 --> 20:16.883
Hey, Eddie.
I -- I have kind of, uh,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.618
an important question
for you.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.588
Oh, yeah? I actually have
an important question for you.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.323
Why is my landlord here?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.458
Uh, I wanna
buy your house.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.059
Actually, that's not
a question, is it?

20:27.159 --> 20:28.995
You wanna buy my house?

20:29.095 --> 20:31.097
How What?

20:31.197 --> 20:32.965
The wife was so thrilled
with your sun-room plans

20:33.065 --> 20:34.133
that I showed her
the rest of them,

20:34.233 --> 20:35.435
and she was like,
"Build it all."

20:35.535 --> 20:36.603
I was like,
"Well, da doy, Marilyn.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.405
We don't have enough room
on our property."

20:38.505 --> 20:40.139
She was like, "Well, da doy
yourself, Eddie.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.141
Why don't we just buy the
neighbor's property and expand?"

20:42.241 --> 20:45.144
So I, uh, called the old
landlord here, made an offer.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.979
Hey, do you wanna be
our official architect?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.682
No! You --
You can't do this!

20:49.782 --> 20:51.183
We just signed
a new lease. Carl?

20:51.284 --> 20:52.985
I was just
saying that.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.487
Great.
That's settled.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.988
We're never gonna
speak of this again.

20:58.057 --> 21:00.293
Is there a dog barking
in your yard?

21:00.393 --> 21:02.429
Why -- Why would there be a dog
in our backyard?

21:02.529 --> 21:03.930
We are not allowed
to have dogs,

21:04.030 --> 21:05.665
and dogs know this.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.167
Speak!

21:08.267 --> 21:10.036
**

21:10.136 --> 21:12.972
Hello,
lease violation.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.174
You've got a deal.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.143
Let's say...

21:17.243 --> 21:18.678
out by the end
of the month?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.514
**

21:21.614 --> 21:22.682
Sure.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.984
Now you obey a command.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.893
