WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:07.094
12 across: "2018 NBA
Rookie of the Year."

00:07.137 --> 00:09.661
[chuckles] Claire-bear,
pass me that pencil, please.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.882
[chuckles] Ah!

00:12.925 --> 00:15.406
This bad boy's
going in pen, baby.[chuckles] Oh.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.061
I love it when you get all
confident during word games.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.628
Thank you.

00:19.671 --> 00:23.023
Uh, the 2018 NBA Rookie of
the Year is none other than...

00:23.066 --> 00:24.850
he's my favorite player...

00:24.894 --> 00:26.461
I want to name my
child after him...

00:26.504 --> 00:28.898
Uh...
That might be more
of a conversation.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.508
Ben Simmons!

00:30.552 --> 00:32.467
You want to name our kid
after Ben Simmons?
Yeah.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.773
Ben Simmons Davis.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.428
Well, what if it's a girl?

00:37.472 --> 00:39.039
Ben Simmons Marie Davis.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.823
[laughs]
Kind of like it.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.042
It's doing something.[car door shuts]

00:42.085 --> 00:43.739
Oh, that's Cooper.
He's home early.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.784
Damn it. He's always walking
in on us doing something lame.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.438
I know. God.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.484
See, this is the kind of thing
that no one warns you about

00:49.527 --> 00:51.138
when you agree to allow
a world famous pop star

00:51.181 --> 00:52.139
to move in with you.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.792
Okay. What do we do?
Uh...

00:53.836 --> 00:54.967
I don't... um...

00:55.011 --> 00:56.143
I don't... uh,
just be cool.

00:56.186 --> 00:59.102
Yeah, just be cool.

00:59.146 --> 01:02.062
Uh... um...

01:09.243 --> 01:10.505
Hey, guys.

01:10.548 --> 01:11.941
Hey, how you doing, man?COOPER: Yeah, all right.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.203
Hey, you know that
feeling when you know

01:13.247 --> 01:14.944
you're in love right away?Oh, totally.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.076
Like, uh, when we first started

01:16.119 --> 01:17.251
mixing M&M's
in with our popcorn.

01:17.294 --> 01:21.559
[chuckles] So, who's
the lucky lady?

01:21.603 --> 01:23.083
Vanessa Cole.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.867
That country singer who sings
"That Dog Ain't Right."

01:24.910 --> 01:26.390
Oh, we love that song, right?CLAIRE: Yeah.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.274
[both laugh]

01:42.928 --> 01:47.063
So, you're dating Vanessa.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.543
Well, before she goes
on her fall tour,

01:48.586 --> 01:50.197
I want to surprise her
with a big, romantic gesture,

01:50.240 --> 01:51.981
but I'm kind of sick
of my go-to moves.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.461
You know, like renting out
Dodger's Stadium

01:53.504 --> 01:55.071
to watch Field of Dreams...Right.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.247
...or eating a 12-course meal
at the Vatican.
Of course.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.641
How did you pull that off?

01:59.684 --> 02:00.903
Oh, I know the owner.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.948
God?

02:02.992 --> 02:05.255
So, I was thinking,

02:05.299 --> 02:08.171
you guys have been together
for half my life...

02:08.215 --> 02:11.522
Feels like a hurtful
way to keep time.
No.

02:11.566 --> 02:14.090
What big, romantic moves
have you done over the years?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.048
Oh. [laughs]
Oh. [laughs]

02:16.092 --> 02:17.441
Don't even get us...Don't get us started.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.748
Right?
Because once we start,
we ain't stopping.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.532
Yeah. There's so many,
it's like, um...

02:21.576 --> 02:23.230
I mean, it just goes
on and on and on.[rolls tongue]

02:23.273 --> 02:24.840
[both stammering]

02:24.883 --> 02:27.059
Hmm. Well, there's
that one... hmm...

02:27.103 --> 02:28.757
CLAIRE:
Oh! Oh! Okay.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.193
Get him. Let him know.Ooh. Okay. So...

02:30.237 --> 02:34.197
Let him know.So, just last week,

02:34.241 --> 02:38.332
Jake totally surprised me
by filling up my car with gas.Mm-hmm.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.509
'Cause everyone knows that
the way to a woman's heart

02:41.552 --> 02:44.164
is through her gas tank.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.993
That's not a euphemism.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.212
JAKE:
Oh, I know.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.214
Um, like, uh, Claire,
she always leaves me

02:51.258 --> 02:53.173
cute, little, sexy notes

02:53.216 --> 02:56.001
like this one I found
in my, uh, briefcase today.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.047

02:58.090 --> 03:01.006
[sexy voice]:
"Jake, please buy lightbulbs."

03:03.922 --> 03:06.403
I mean, I can't be the only one
who's getting goose bumps. Huh?

03:07.665 --> 03:09.276
Look at that. [chuckles]

03:09.319 --> 03:11.408
You know what? We're past
all that stuff. You know?

03:11.452 --> 03:13.454
I mean, I don't have
to prove I love someone

03:13.497 --> 03:16.500
when I regularly pick up their
prescription toothpaste.Aw, yeah.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.285
That's right, baby.

03:18.328 --> 03:21.201
[inhales]

03:21.244 --> 03:23.290
[coughs]

03:25.248 --> 03:26.858
It's working.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.383
It's working and,
uh, so are we.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.342
All right, well, let me know

03:32.386 --> 03:33.735
if you think of anything.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.259
All right.[laughs]

03:36.303 --> 03:38.392
You know, babe, I didn't
want to embarrass you
in front of Cooper,

03:38.435 --> 03:40.785
but that toothpaste
is not working.

to propose a toast.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.730
Yay.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.602
To my beautiful wife

04:14.645 --> 04:16.952
who makes me excited
to wake up every day.
Aw.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.301
Happy birthday, baby.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.172
Ah, happy birthday.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.305
Thank you.
Thank you.
Super sweet.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.742
Cooper says happy
birthday, as well.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.570
He'd be here,
but he rented out SeaWorld

04:26.614 --> 04:28.746
so he and Vanessa
could watch Finding Nemo.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.618
Do you think he just doesn't
know about movie theaters?

04:32.359 --> 04:34.622
That seems a little
extravagant.
CLAIRE: Right?

04:34.665 --> 04:36.928
It's hard not to feel
like unromantic losers

04:36.972 --> 04:38.321
when you're living
with a celebrity

04:38.365 --> 04:39.888
who, for Valentine's Day,

04:39.931 --> 04:43.544
bought his girlfriend a panda
holding a box of chocolates.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.285
An actual panda.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.766
I mean, is it okay that
we don't do those things?

04:48.810 --> 04:49.985
Of course it is.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.595
That big, showy stuff
is for new couples

04:51.639 --> 04:53.336
who don't know
what true love is.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.772

I don't know.

04:54.816 --> 04:55.773
I think every
once in a while

04:55.817 --> 04:57.558
a big move can be nice.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.603
Trust me, honey, a small,
quiet dinner with my family,

04:59.647 --> 05:00.952
that's all I need.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.433
Right? I mean, married
people don't need to do

05:03.477 --> 05:05.609
that over-the-top,
crazy stuff.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.281
Bonnie, I know we've missed
a lot of big events together

05:25.325 --> 05:26.717
while we were working,
so I decided to gather

05:26.761 --> 05:28.763
our best friends and our family

05:28.806 --> 05:30.025
to show you just how much

05:30.068 --> 05:32.375
your life and your love
means to me.

Claire-bear, we're good, right?

05:59.837 --> 06:00.882
Our fire's still burning?

06:00.925 --> 06:03.363
Yeah, of course it is.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.759
No, I mean, when Cooper
does a grand gesture,

06:08.803 --> 06:10.152
it's one thing,
but now your parents?

06:10.195 --> 06:12.807
No, babe, we are en fuego.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.635
Okay?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.898
We just need to accept
that our fire

06:16.941 --> 06:20.815
is more of a controlled burn.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.034
I guess that sounds good.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.385
Yeah, we're-we're a safe
and sensible flame. Right?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.691
We're like, uh,
carbon monoxide poisoning.

06:27.735 --> 06:31.260
You can't detect it, but it'll
take your breath away.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.871
Definitely. You know,
it's like those fake candles

06:33.915 --> 06:35.830
that they have
at The Cheesecake Factory.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.615
Consistent, yet electric.
Yep.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.793
[lisping]: Yeah.
You know, I just...

06:42.837 --> 06:44.665
I just want to make sure
we're still passionate.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.057
You know?

06:46.101 --> 06:48.103
[lisping]: Sweetie,
we are so passionate.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.279
It's all good.

06:50.322 --> 06:54.414
Oh, wait, stop, babe.
We forgot to kiss.
[sighs]

06:54.457 --> 06:56.807
Well, let's just have
a makeup kiss at breakfast.

06:56.851 --> 07:01.725
Okay? Mm. Good night.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.684
Sleep tight, sweetie.

07:03.727 --> 07:04.946
Okay.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.783
I have been married to Claire
for four years now,

07:15.826 --> 07:17.262
and I just want
to do something big

07:17.306 --> 07:18.742
to remind her
how much I love her.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.179
So what's,
like, a cool,

07:21.223 --> 07:24.400
over-the-top romantic move
I could do?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.316
Do you want the name
of my stadium guy?

07:29.623 --> 07:31.581
I can't rent out Dodger Stadium.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.584
Are you not a baseball fan?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.499
Eh...

07:36.543 --> 07:39.763
Yeah, dude, that's the only
speed bump in that plan.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.593
What about a private flight
to Fiji?
All right.

07:43.637 --> 07:44.986
Listen, you are at a Bentley,

07:45.029 --> 07:48.163
I'm-a need you
at a bus pass, okay?

07:49.773 --> 07:52.733
What is the most affordable
grand gesture you've done?

07:52.776 --> 07:55.518
Well, I got my last girlfriend's
name tattooed on my body.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.998
Oh, Claire loves tattoos!

07:57.041 --> 07:59.522
Ah, but that might only be
when they're on The Rock.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.871
Dwayne is such a sweet guy.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.177
Why don't I text him

08:02.220 --> 08:06.224
to see if he can take Claire
on a picnic.
No!

08:06.268 --> 08:07.835
No!

08:09.880 --> 08:13.188
Sorry. No. I...

08:13.231 --> 08:15.320
I don't want that.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.280
But that tattoo idea
is perfect, you know.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.804
It-It's sexy,
it's permanent, you know.

08:20.848 --> 08:22.371
Plus, Claire would
never see it coming

08:22.414 --> 08:24.286
because she knows I'm afraid
of needles. [laughs]

08:27.115 --> 08:30.901
[needles buzzing]Ahh!

08:30.945 --> 08:34.078
Hey, uh, what are we talking
on the pain scale here, huh?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.297
It's more of a tickle.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.128
Ooh, tickly.

08:40.998 --> 08:41.999
So, Jake, where'd you like

08:42.043 --> 08:44.741
to get your tattoo today?

08:44.785 --> 08:46.482
Uh, probably a cleaner room,
that'd be nice,

08:46.526 --> 08:49.311
uh, maybe somewhere
with a little more privacy.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.574
He means where on your body.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.923
Oh.

08:52.967 --> 08:56.100
Well, as Captain Hook says
with his treasure maps,

08:56.144 --> 08:57.841
"Flex marks
the spot."

08:57.885 --> 08:58.973
Huh?

08:59.016 --> 09:00.975
He wants it on his shoulder.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.977
Jake, are you absolutely sure
about this?

09:03.020 --> 09:04.892
Yeah, I am,
I'm-I'm sure.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.850
Uh, you know, I'm-I'm
crazy about Claire.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.809
I want to do something
crazy for her,

09:08.852 --> 09:11.289
something big,
something romantic, you know?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.682
Got it.

09:12.726 --> 09:16.643
I can make your junk
look like a dragon.

09:16.686 --> 09:20.385
Uh, great brainstorming sesh,
buddy, that's-that's nice,

09:20.429 --> 09:22.605
but, um, I was thinking
something a little less scary

09:22.649 --> 09:24.868
and a little more, uh, swirly.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.348
You're the boss.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.916
Okay, just raise
your finger

09:28.959 --> 09:31.092
if you need me to stop
for any reason.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.181
[chuckles] The only finger
I'll be raising is my thumb

09:33.224 --> 09:35.096
because hell yeah, dude.

09:35.139 --> 09:38.926
[needle buzzing][screaming]

09:38.969 --> 09:40.710
Ha-ha!

09:40.754 --> 09:43.713
It tickles!
You were right!

09:43.757 --> 09:46.760
It tickles so bad!

09:57.292 --> 09:58.902
Oh, Jake, guess what,

09:58.946 --> 10:01.209
there was a crossword
clue about the IRS.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.037
It was ten letters,
started with a "C."

10:03.080 --> 10:05.605
Compulsory.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.132
Where have you been?

10:11.175 --> 10:13.656
Well, I had lunch with Coop-dog,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.353
went and picked up
your lightbulbs.

10:15.397 --> 10:16.920
Oh.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.401
Oh, and I, uh,
slammed a little body art.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.055
Wait, what?

10:21.098 --> 10:24.928
Oh, you're talking about
my "champ stamp"?

10:24.972 --> 10:28.149
Jake, is that a freaking tattoo?
Oh, my God, well, let me see it.

10:28.192 --> 10:32.196
Easy, easy.
No touching the dancers.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.200
He said I'm not supposed to take
the bandages off yet, but, uh,

10:36.244 --> 10:41.075
tat-rats like us don't
play by the rules, so...

10:41.118 --> 10:44.165
[muttering]

10:45.949 --> 10:47.951
Ready?
Here, ready?

10:49.083 --> 10:52.129
Ah, just peel that...

10:52.173 --> 10:54.523
[moans]

11:03.488 --> 11:05.839
Woo.
[laughs]

11:05.882 --> 11:10.539
Jake, aw!

11:10.582 --> 11:13.150
You got my name
tattooed on your arm.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.674
Yup.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.371
Did it hurt?

11:16.414 --> 11:19.679
I screamed so much they made me
put my own socks in my mouth.

11:19.722 --> 11:23.117
Oh, my God, well, this is
the most romantic thing ever.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.384
But...
But what?

11:29.427 --> 11:30.994
Nothing. It's just...

11:31.038 --> 11:34.084
I don't know, this is so sweet,
and it just makes me feel bad

11:34.128 --> 11:36.173
'cause I've never done anything
big like this for you.

11:36.217 --> 11:40.700
Sea bass,
don't you dare.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.096
I may be painted,

11:46.140 --> 11:49.099
but you're the masterpiece
around here, okay?

11:49.143 --> 11:52.537
[laughs] Okay. Ah...

11:52.581 --> 11:55.323
You know, I've never hooked up
with a tattoo guy before.

11:55.366 --> 11:58.456
Oh, well, all that's
about to change because, uh,

11:58.500 --> 12:00.197
as they say
in Space Jam,

12:00.241 --> 12:04.201
"Y'all ready for this?"

12:06.073 --> 12:08.075
Well, I'm excited
to help, Claire,

12:08.118 --> 12:09.641
but just because Jake
did something over the top

12:09.685 --> 12:11.121
doesn't mean
you have to as well.

12:11.165 --> 12:14.951
Mm, you have no idea
how marriage works, do you?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.694
I just felt so special
when I saw his tattoo,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.914
I want to make sure that Jake
feels the same way.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.307
Okay, well, I usually start
with something they like

12:23.351 --> 12:25.788
and then build from it.
So what's Jake into?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.835
Um, well, he is really into

12:28.878 --> 12:32.012
food, sleeping, playing ball...

12:32.055 --> 12:36.625
Oh, my God, I married
a Golden Retriever.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.064
You, uh, you mentioned food,

12:41.108 --> 12:43.588
would, uh, would Jake like to
cook a meal with Gordon Ramsey?

12:43.632 --> 12:45.068
If you pay extra

12:45.112 --> 12:46.896
he yells at you until you feel
like absolute garbage,

12:46.940 --> 12:48.158
it's pretty great.

12:48.202 --> 12:51.422
Uh, well, he's-he's
not into gourmet food.

12:51.466 --> 12:55.818
Okay, um, what about a sparring
session with Conor McGregor?

12:55.862 --> 12:59.256
If you ask nicely he'll knock
you out, it's pretty great.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.823
Are all these people
in your phone?

13:00.867 --> 13:02.216
Yeah, these are just the people

13:02.259 --> 13:04.218
I'm playing Words With Friends
against right now.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.742
Okay, give me that thing.
I need to see your contacts.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.702
Oh, my God, you're friends
with The Rock?

13:10.746 --> 13:11.703
[laughs]

13:11.747 --> 13:12.879
Oh, my God...

13:12.922 --> 13:14.445
No!

13:18.188 --> 13:20.408
No. No, um,

13:20.451 --> 13:23.541
yeah, I don't think
Jake would like that.

13:27.589 --> 13:31.158
[chuckles]

13:31.201 --> 13:34.378
Whoa, man,
nice ink, bro.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.902
It's killer.
I'm a bit of a

13:35.945 --> 13:38.861
squid myself.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.645
Thinking about getting
a whole sleeve.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.908
That looks bad.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.127
Yeah, badass.

13:44.171 --> 13:47.130
I heard guys like us can't be
buried in a Jewish cemetery.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.306
No, I'm saying that looks nasty.

13:49.350 --> 13:52.657
I'm a dirty dog,
through and through.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.790
Sir, I'm trying to tell you

13:54.834 --> 13:57.880
your tattoo
is horribly infected.

13:57.924 --> 14:01.318
So that's not just muscle juice
leaking out of it?

14:10.066 --> 14:10.545
[wincing]

14:10.588 --> 14:12.025
Stop.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.592
Jake, I-I'm not trying
to scare you,

14:14.636 --> 14:16.159
but this looks very serious.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.118
That infection
is verging on necrosis.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.380
I'm sorry, I just don't see

14:19.423 --> 14:20.860
a world where
we're not amputating.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.166
[high-pitched]:
No-- put it down!
What are you doing?!

14:23.210 --> 14:24.907
Hey, hey! What's going on?

14:24.951 --> 14:28.432
[both laugh]Oh, my God.

14:28.476 --> 14:32.349
Your face. Your face.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.657
[imitating yelps]

14:35.700 --> 14:37.702
It's for the lime, Jake.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.968
BONNIE: Oh, my God.Don't worry, buddy.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.186
We're just gonna give you
this antibiotic

14:43.230 --> 14:45.101
and it should clear it up
in a week or so.

14:45.145 --> 14:48.757
But I have to ask, Jake, why on
Earth would you get a tattoo?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.237
Well, because I thought
only new couples

14:50.280 --> 14:52.152
had to do these grand gestures.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.762
But then, you two
started doing them.

14:53.805 --> 14:55.590
Well, technically,
only Gerald did one.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.854
Oh, I repaid the favor.
Nothing's for free, Jake.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.291
[chuckles]

15:04.860 --> 15:08.168
[retches]

15:08.211 --> 15:10.126
All right, I guess I should
probably sterilize this,

15:10.170 --> 15:11.562
being-- all right,

15:11.606 --> 15:14.174
there we go.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.089
Other arm, other arm, please.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.134
Other arm.All right, very well.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.223
Could you give me
a countdown, please?

15:20.267 --> 15:23.052
Oh, I wish I could,
but I'm not a pediatrician.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.967
All right, don't
be surprised

15:25.011 --> 15:26.664
if the antibiotics make
your arm a little sore.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.928
And keep washing that area,
or we'll have to, you know...

15:28.971 --> 15:30.103
[screams]

15:30.146 --> 15:31.974
[both laugh]

15:32.018 --> 15:33.758
Bonnie, Bonnie.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.586
He fell for it again.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.286
Hey, Claire, you home?

15:39.329 --> 15:40.896
Jake. Where have you been?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.811
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.204
Uh, I-I...

15:44.247 --> 15:46.510
Got a little infection
going on in my tat.
What?

15:46.554 --> 15:49.339
Yeah, my arms are so sore,
I can barely move them both.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.385
Man, this is awful timing.
Well, I'm not supposed to say,

15:51.428 --> 15:53.387
but Claire's planned
an awesome surprise for you.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.475
Really? What is it?

15:54.518 --> 15:56.346
Check your phone.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.131
[grunting]:
Okay.

15:58.174 --> 16:02.004
"Dr. Dunk," that's me,

16:02.048 --> 16:05.268
"Grab your keys and make
a fast break to Henley Park

16:05.312 --> 16:06.617
or you'll be
called for a foul."

16:06.661 --> 16:08.054
This is basketball-related?

16:08.097 --> 16:09.925
Yeah. All I can say is that
Claire's really excited

16:09.969 --> 16:11.274
to do this grand gesture
for you.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.929
Ah, nice. I mean,
I can't play basketball,

16:13.973 --> 16:15.931
but I might as well
drive down there and thank her.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.325
Grab my keys, man.
Let's go. [chuckles]

16:18.368 --> 16:20.370
Ha, ha.

16:24.461 --> 16:27.464
You know what? You know what--
you steer, I'll do the pedals.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.600
CLAIRE:
Jake!

16:32.643 --> 16:34.689
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here. What...

16:34.732 --> 16:37.257
Why are you walking
like you've been lassoed?

16:38.519 --> 16:41.087
Can I talk to you for a second
over here, please?

16:41.130 --> 16:42.697
Over here...

16:42.740 --> 16:45.874
Yeah?Yeah, uh, listen, um,

16:45.917 --> 16:49.486
I love that you planned this
grand gesture for me, but, um...

16:49.530 --> 16:51.619
My champ stamp
got infected, and, uh,

16:51.662 --> 16:54.709
I can't play
basketball today.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.058
Seriously?

16:56.102 --> 16:58.408
Yeah.
[sighs]
That stinks.

16:58.452 --> 17:01.672
Well, you know how you've always
wanted to play with NBA players?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.326
Yes.

17:03.370 --> 17:07.287
I kind of got you into a charity
tournament with your favorite.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.333
It's Ben Simmons.

17:11.856 --> 17:14.772
[squeaking]:
What? He's-- aww, come on.

17:14.816 --> 17:17.949
What? Is it...?
How did you do this?

17:17.993 --> 17:19.168
Uh, Cooper knows him.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.865
Yeah, I didn't even know
Ben played basketball.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.867
But if he's as good at this game
as he is at Scrabble,

17:22.911 --> 17:24.086
you're gonna be in great shape.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.653
[groans]

17:25.696 --> 17:27.263
Hey, Coop.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.135
Hey, man.
Hey, Claire.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.398
What's up?
What's up, Ben Simmons?

17:32.877 --> 17:35.184
So, um, anyway, um,
I'm so sorry, Ben,

17:35.228 --> 17:36.403
but I think we're gonna
have to take a rain check,

17:36.446 --> 17:38.361
'cause my husband's
in pretty serious...

17:38.405 --> 17:40.450
Awe of his amazing wife.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.061
We doing this, man.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.150
We gonna do this.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.368
CLAIRE:
Okay, you got this, babe!

18:17.313 --> 18:19.533
Well, I, uh, really thought
that Jake was gonna be able

18:19.576 --> 18:21.100
to play without his arms,
but it turns out,

18:21.143 --> 18:23.754
I didn't know
what basketball was.

18:25.539 --> 18:28.585
Hey. I love you, babe.
You got this.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.589
All right, Ben, let's huddle up.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.157
Do we have to? Your shoulder
smells like really old turkey.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.332
Listen, I got an idea.

We're gonna win this game

so amazing, Claire-Bear.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.017
Yeah? Oh...[grunts]

19:12.629 --> 19:14.544
Get your butt in here for a hug.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.938
Oh...[shouts]

19:16.981 --> 19:18.635
Do it... Oh!

19:18.679 --> 19:20.594
Okay. [chuckles]
Right?

19:20.637 --> 19:22.596
Worked out well. Yeah.Uh-- pleasure doing
business with you. Yeah.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.685
Yes, yes.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.862
Ah, I'm gonna have to think of
something huge to top this.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.821
Uh, is it crazy that I don't
want another grand gesture?

19:30.865 --> 19:33.476
I mean, they're sweet and all,
but I kind of prefer

19:33.520 --> 19:34.782
when you just do little things,

19:34.825 --> 19:37.350
like, how you always fill up
my car with gas.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.569
Or those cute little notes
you always leave me.Yeah.

19:39.613 --> 19:40.831
Or like how you always
bring an extra spoon

19:40.875 --> 19:42.050
whenever you eat ice cream.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.269
Yeah, exactly.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.445
They're more like
bland gestures, but...

19:45.488 --> 19:46.837
Mm....they're better.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.056
Because that means
that we're thinking

19:48.099 --> 19:49.884
about each other all the time.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.755
Totally. Like,
I'm with you right now,

19:51.799 --> 19:53.192
but I still miss you
whenever I blink.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.541
Claire, where'd you...

19:54.584 --> 19:56.282
Oh, my God, Claire, I can't...

19:56.325 --> 19:57.718
Claire, where'd you--
oh, there you are.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.328
[laughs]Oh, my God.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.461
You guys are geniuses.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.289
We're listening.Go on.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.421
I kept trying to surprise
Vanessa with a big move,

20:05.465 --> 20:06.770
but none of them
were having an impact.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.685
So I thought, "What would
Jake and Claire do?"

20:08.729 --> 20:11.732
And I filled up her gas tank and
she went absolutely nuts for it.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.082
Oh, my God.
Well, that's amazing.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.476
Yeah, I know. And I got to say,
I'm-I'm really grateful

20:16.519 --> 20:18.956
for you guys
letting me stay here.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.567
You're really onto something
with this normal life.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.829
[Jake and Claire chuckle]

20:23.178 --> 20:25.920
Well, uh, we're happy
to have you here, Coops.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.530
And, uh, take it from us:

20:27.574 --> 20:30.185
sometimes $40 of gas
is all it takes.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.580
$40? I'm gonna need the number
of your jet fuel guy.

20:35.277 --> 20:36.800
Oh.Oh, you filled up her plane?

20:36.844 --> 20:39.977
Yeah.Different situation.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.892
Yeah, she said fueling up
her private jet

20:41.936 --> 20:44.025
was the most thoughtful thing
anyone's ever done for her.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.767
Thanks. $40, ha...

20:46.810 --> 20:47.855
Oh.
Ah.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.900
[phone buzzing]

20:49.944 --> 20:51.380
Cooper's phone.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.729
Uh...[clattering]

20:52.773 --> 20:55.384
Oh-- oh, my God. It's The Rock.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.342
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

20:56.385 --> 20:57.647
Yeah! Look.Can I see that?

20:57.691 --> 20:59.867
Ooh, wow.
[shouts, groans]
