11:47.805 --> 11:51.707
We'll find a safe place
for her to stay.

11:51.975 --> 11:54.410
- So what are we gonna do
when we find her--

11:54.412 --> 11:56.879
invite her back to
the lair for pizza?

11:56.881 --> 11:58.414
- That's a good question.

11:58.416 --> 12:01.717
The retromutagen
still isn't finished.

[Electronic sounds]

12:06.757 --> 12:10.092

Another kraangdroid party!

Your brother.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.954
We're your friends.

12:37.956 --> 12:39.388
Remember who you are!

12:39.390 --> 12:41.724
- [Hiss]
- She's becoming more snake-like

12:41.726 --> 12:42.591
by the hour.

12:42.593 --> 12:45.094
She doesn't understand, leo.

12:45.096 --> 12:47.396
- She understands, donnie.

12:47.398 --> 12:48.631
You're changing, karai.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.766
We wanna help you.

- [Shrieks]

13:36.047 --> 13:37.146

13:37.148 --> 13:42.051

13:42.053 --> 13:43.986
[Both coughing]

13:43.988 --> 13:47.189

13:56.934 --> 13:58.834
- [Laughing]
Our bargaining chip

13:58.836 --> 14:02.238

Hee hee!
Whoo! Hee hee hee!

14:08.513 --> 14:09.979
- Nice job back there, amigo.

14:09.981 --> 14:12.715
I'll take her
to master shredder.

14:12.717 --> 14:15.584
- Wait, why do you get to
take her to shredder?

14:15.586 --> 14:19.522
- Because you are too big
and bony to ride this bike.

14:19.524 --> 14:20.890
- Watch it, sashimi lips!

14:20.892 --> 14:24.727

14:50.688 --> 14:51.787
You get snake girl

14:51.789 --> 14:54.757
and steal cool-looking
motor scooter!

14:54.759 --> 14:56.058
- I barely made it, big s.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.259
The streets
are full of kraang.

14:57.261 --> 15:00.830
Let's dial up shredder and get
the heck outta dodge.

15:00.832 --> 15:02.631
[Line ringing]

15:02.633 --> 15:04.934
- Hi. Is steranko.

15:07.904 --> 15:09.905

15:12.376 --> 15:13.676
Is shredder!

15:13.678 --> 15:16.378
We has your snake daughter.

15:16.380 --> 15:17.680
Make deal.

15:17.682 --> 15:20.783
Da.
At the docks.

15:36.099 --> 15:38.167
- [Softly]
Donnie, you sure they're here?

15:38.169 --> 15:40.970
- I planted a whole bunch of
spy roaches on steranko

15:40.972 --> 15:41.871
during the fight.

15:41.873 --> 15:43.139
I'm pretty sure
he ate most of them,

15:43.141 --> 15:46.408
but there's still one
little guy left.

15:46.410 --> 15:50.779
Yeah, yeah, they're definitely
down there.

15:51.081 --> 15:56.685
- So the thief who stole from me
desires to make a deal.

15:56.687 --> 15:59.321
Where is karai?

16:08.765 --> 16:10.799
- You get us out of city
safe.

16:10.801 --> 16:14.170
You get girl.
That is deal.

16:14.172 --> 16:17.806
- I don't make deals.

16:18.208 --> 16:21.944
But perhaps
this is worth the exception.

16:21.946 --> 16:26.782
Give me karai, and you will
leave this city alive.

16:26.784 --> 16:27.850
- Let her go...

16:27.852 --> 16:32.054
And I'll let all of you
walk away alive!

16:35.125 --> 16:36.392

16:58.215 --> 17:00.950
- We're just getting started.

17:02.385 --> 17:03.352
- It's simple.

17:03.354 --> 17:05.521
Give her to me,
and the pain will stop.

17:05.522 --> 17:07.756
- Attack, vicious snake woman!

17:07.758 --> 17:10.326

on it, homefish!

17:15.132 --> 17:17.766
- [Grunting]
You talk too much!

17:17.768 --> 17:21.136
And that says a lot,
coming from me!

17:24.874 --> 17:30.079
- Whoo!
Sham on, uh-sham on!

17:33.883 --> 17:34.917
- That's better.

17:34.919 --> 17:38.254
I can finally hear
myself think again.

17:43.893 --> 17:45.160
- Karai!

18:01.378 --> 18:03.012

Comet.

- Comet?

18:22.133 --> 18:24.266
What does that mean?
- No!

18:24.268 --> 18:25.267
My daughter!

18:25.269 --> 18:27.102
- She's not your daughter!

18:27.104 --> 18:29.505
- I raised her.
Cared for her.

18:29.507 --> 18:30.973
She is mine!

18:30.975 --> 18:34.009
- [Grunts]
- Aah!

18:35.612 --> 18:37.212
What?!

18:41.851 --> 18:42.885
Someone must pay for this.

18:42.887 --> 18:47.022
Take them to stockman's
laboratory.

18:48.358 --> 18:51.060
- What happened back there?
We had her!

18:51.062 --> 18:53.095
- It was too dangerous,
raph.

18:53.097 --> 18:53.896
We'll find her.

18:53.898 --> 18:55.998
- She gave me a clue
where she is, though.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.903
She pointed east...
And said "comet"...
