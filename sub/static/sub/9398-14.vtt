00:01.000 --> 00:02.695
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.769 --> 00:05.397
This is the first draft of a novel I'm writing.

00:05.471 --> 00:07.406
- Who knew?
- No one.

00:07.474 --> 00:10.170
I could pass calculus in my sleep.
You're the one flunking out.

00:10.243 --> 00:12.177
And this is the key to the cabinet
with the answers.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.269
Got it.

00:13.646 --> 00:15.113
<i>My mom tried to kill herself.</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:17.411
I felt relieved,
like maybe it was for the best.

00:17.484 --> 00:18.883
Have you guys met Chase?

00:18.952 --> 00:21.887
He's our newest Clean Teen.
Virgins for life.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.321
Hi. Brooke Davis, Clean Teen.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.393
I'm kind of afraid of being here with you.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.053
- Why?
- You're hot.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.231
Open your eyes, Luke.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.931
I saw Jimmy lying there on the floor dead,

00:40.006 --> 00:41.633
and Keith was standing above him.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.868
Jimmy didn't kill Keith.

00:42.942 --> 00:46.036
Lucas said something
really unsettling today.

00:46.112 --> 00:47.602
What'd he say?

00:48.715 --> 00:52.310
He said he doesn't think
that Jimmy Edwards killed Keith.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.792
<i>Do you ever wonder</i>
<i>if we make the moments in our lives,</i>

01:03.863 --> 01:06.730
<i>or if the moments in our lives make us?</i>

01:06.800 --> 01:09.132
<i>Give me five. Give me five.</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:10.897
<i>Four, five!</i>

01:15.442 --> 01:17.103
<i>Okay, watch. Are you watching me?</i>

01:17.177 --> 01:20.169
<i>Okay, go ahead. Nice shot.</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:23.079
<i>- Can you say merry Christmas?</i>
<i>- Merry Christmas.</i>

01:23.149 --> 01:26.016
It's amazing how fast they grow up,
isn't it?

01:34.027 --> 01:35.016
Ouch.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.223
Keith bought me that bike.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.735
Hey, Mom, don't forget,
I gotta get fitted for my tux today.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.396
Right, the prom.

01:46.973 --> 01:49.703
You come by the café,
and we'll go take a look this afternoon.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.175
All right.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.138
How's he doing?

01:56.449 --> 01:59.850
I mean, with this notion about Keith
not being taken by the Edwards kid?

01:59.919 --> 02:03.082
I think he just needs
to believe in that somehow.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.220
Let me take him shopping
this afternoon for the tux.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.782
I've missed enough important moments
in his life.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.330
I'd like to do something about that.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.727
Please?

02:17.103 --> 02:18.570
Hey, Glenda.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.031
Hi.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.642
Oh, you remember Peyton, right?

02:23.710 --> 02:27.202
- Yeah, sure. The loner.
- Loner cheerleader.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.908
I really like the picture you took of Lucas.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.044
The eye shadow
was a little Fall Out Boy, though.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.850
So, Lucas, that book that you loaned me?

02:36.923 --> 02:40.120
I'm just in chapter 10,
but I'd love to talk to you about it.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.161
Yeah. Good. No, anytime.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.456
Okay.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.388
Bye.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.793
- What book?
- Oh, I...

02:49.869 --> 02:51.894
I loaned her a copy of <i>The Great Gatsby.</i>

02:51.971 --> 02:53.905
She's never read it, can you believe that?

02:53.973 --> 02:57.033
I took her for more of an Edgar Allan Poe
kind of girl.

03:01.514 --> 03:05.280
- We should slow down.
- Feels like just the right speed to me.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.221
Really, I have to go.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.551
Saved by the bell.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.047 --> 03:35.139
Hey.

03:35.481 --> 03:36.539
I gotta ask you something

03:36.616 --> 03:38.208
and I really don't want you
to get pissed off,

03:38.284 --> 03:39.376
but I have to ask you.

03:39.452 --> 03:40.476
Okay.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.043
It's about the stolen test.

03:42.121 --> 03:46.319
You were failing calculus
and then you just got an A on the last test.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.623
- Just tell me it's a coincidence.
- It was a coincidence.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.664
- Seriously, Brooke?
- Yeah.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.528
I know
I have to pass the class to graduate,

03:53.600 --> 03:54.999
and you were busy tutoring Rachel,

03:55.068 --> 03:57.696
so I just got help from Chase instead.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.366
Really?

04:00.340 --> 04:01.637
Okay.

04:02.375 --> 04:06.937
Sorry. Principal Turner is just really pissed
right now and he's on a major witch hunt.

04:07.013 --> 04:10.847
You should probably know
you're, like, the prime suspect.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.613
It wasn't me. Scouts honor.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.085
Okay. Sorry.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.394
Why the long face?
You know what today is.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.959
No, but I'm sure
you're about to enlighten me.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.301
Come on.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.905
You've got three weeks of sobriety.

04:36.976 --> 04:39.444
It's the first day you can have visitors.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.104
It's a good day.

04:42.715 --> 04:46.173
After the way I've behaved,
no one is coming for me.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.583
Trust me.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.382
Hey, don't be so sure.

04:50.456 --> 04:54.222
Sometimes, people can surprise you.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.123
<i>Are you on drugs?</i>

05:02.201 --> 05:03.930
You're not turning yourself in.

05:04.003 --> 05:08.201
I just had to lie to Haley,
Turner is closing in, and I am stewed.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.969
Brooke, they don't have any proof.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.477
There is no use to this.
I'm gonna turn myself in.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.069
Fine. Whatever.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.881
Before you turn yourself in,

05:16.949 --> 05:19.850
you might want to take a look at this.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.046
It came for you this morning.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.283
Oh, my God.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.427
Victoria's Secret
wants to franchise Clothes Over Bro's

05:31.497 --> 05:33.590
for their Pink fashion line.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.024
I'm gonna be in stores everywhere!

05:36.102 --> 05:38.536
Maybe not. Look at paragraph 14.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.340
So I like reading your mail.
It's a guilty pleasure.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.201
The contract has a morality clause.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.610
That means they want
Student Council President Brooke Davis,

05:47.680 --> 05:50.114
not l-cheated-in-calculus Brooke Davis.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.844
See, I don't think
an expelled high-school student

05:51.918 --> 05:54.216
exactly fits the Victoria's Secret profile.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.723
- Then what am I gonna do?
- Nothing.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.655
Brooke, trust me,
there's nothing they can do

05:59.726 --> 06:01.023
to prove you cheated on the test.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.695
As some of you may know,

06:03.763 --> 06:08.063
it has come to my attention
that one of you cheated on the last exam.

06:08.735 --> 06:12.171
So, today,
we're all gonna take a little pop quiz.

06:12.705 --> 06:16.539
And I assure you,
when I discover who that cheater is,

06:16.609 --> 06:20.204
they will be dealt with
in the harshest possible way.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.242
Didn't see that one coming.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.929
So, I was thinking
we would get a limo for prom.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.370
I talked to Brooke,
and she and Chase want to share.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.466
- Mouth, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.949
I don't think I can do this.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.114
- What "this"?
- Us.

07:38.324 --> 07:42.055
I think maybe it's not
such a good idea that we're dating.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.997
It's about them, isn't it? The Clean Teens.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.626
It's more complicated than that.

07:48.701 --> 07:51.465
Well, explain it to me.
'Cause I'm pretty good with complicated.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.562
I can't go out with you.

07:56.042 --> 08:00.877
Okay, so we're not dating,
but we're still going to prom, right?

08:00.947 --> 08:04.246
I don't think prom
would be such a good idea either.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.150
This was...

08:09.355 --> 08:11.289
This was a mistake.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.688
I'm sorry.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.464
Maybe you passed the test this time.
I mean, stranger things have happened.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.065
Like, Brooke Davis is dating a Clean Teen?

08:29.809 --> 08:33.039
Maybe. I mean, it didn't feel that bad.

08:33.712 --> 08:37.240
Oh, who am I kidding?
There's no way I passed that test.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.909
Brooke, this could be the chance
that you need to start over.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.046
Think about it. If you passed this time,
you did it all on your own.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.716
Yeah, and if I didn't pass,
I'm gonna get expelled from school,

08:45.791 --> 08:48.123
and my life, as I know it, is over.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.094
Well, I believe in you.

08:50.963 --> 08:54.729
<i>Brooke Davis, please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office immediately.</i>

08:56.636 --> 08:58.263
Well, okay, then.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.468
Dead girl kissing.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.204
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.407
Nice fit for a rental.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.215
- What are you, a 42 regular?
- Yeah.

09:16.422 --> 09:17.889
Not bad.

09:18.858 --> 09:21.827
You know, the trick with formal wear
is to always go classic.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.885
You don't wanna be that guy
looking back 20 years from now,

09:23.963 --> 09:25.794
regretting the blue ruffles.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.594
Yeah, right.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.363
- What'd you wear to prom?
- Blue ruffles.

09:32.605 --> 09:36.701
Hey, Lucas, I know it's been hard for you
without Keith around.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.745
And your mother told me
what you said about Jimmy Edwards.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.404
And I just want you to know

09:41.480 --> 09:44.244
that you may not be wrong
in what you're thinking.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.581
You don't think Jimmy killed Keith?

09:46.652 --> 09:48.381
Not exactly. What I mean is,

09:48.454 --> 09:51.014
I know you and Jimmy were friends,
and maybe you're right.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.058
Maybe Jimmy didn't mean to kill Keith.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.457
And maybe what happened in that hallway
was a terrible accident.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.190
But the truth is we'll never know.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.331
So I need to ask you a favor, Lucas.

10:04.403 --> 10:07.839
I need you to stop
and consider your mother's feelings

10:07.907 --> 10:09.875
because, although she'll never admit it,

10:09.942 --> 10:12.638
all this talk is breaking her up
on the inside.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.579
So you gotta let it go, for her sake.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.911
- How are we doing, gentlemen?
- Fine, thanks.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.646
We're gonna take this Armani.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.348
I'm sorry, sir.
The Armani is only available for purchase.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.516
I'm aware of that, slick.
We'll take the Armani.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.720
You're buying me a tuxedo? Why?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.820
Every man should own his own tuxedo.

10:31.897 --> 10:35.958
And every father should know
what it feels like to buy one for his son.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.513
Nathan.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.607
Hi.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.119
I wasn't sure you'd wanna see me.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.851
Well, to be honest,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.321
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.887
Suicide. Nice one, Mom.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.799
- And thanks for the note, by the way.
- Please, Nathan. Don't.

11:10.536 --> 11:13.300
You can't begin to understand
this disease.

11:13.372 --> 11:14.532
Disease?

11:14.907 --> 11:17.000
Is that what you're calling it now?

11:17.076 --> 11:19.044
Peyton's mom, Ellie, had a disease.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.341
Cancer. That's a disease, Mom.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.872
What you have is a weakness.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.315
And when the hell
are you gonna start fighting it?

11:26.385 --> 11:29.718
I know. I know I've been weak.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.687
But I...

11:33.159 --> 11:35.059
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

11:36.095 --> 11:38.791
Your terrible life
in that big expensive house?

11:38.864 --> 11:42.459
'Cause I'm not seeing it, Mom.
What are you so scared of?

11:44.103 --> 11:45.331
Myself.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.374
It's easy in here.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.412
I have a support team to stay sober.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.805
But out there alone?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.785
I'm not sure I can trust myself.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.320
Mom.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.053
You better figure it out.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.460
Because if things don't change soon,

12:11.530 --> 12:14.727
you're not gonna have anything
to come home to.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.738
Thanks. It's pretty cool.
I think Peyton's really gonna love it.

12:26.812 --> 12:29.110
You're welcome. So, Peyton, huh?

12:30.116 --> 12:31.344
Yeah.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.112
Well, have a good time,
Senior State Champ.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.450
It's a good time to be alive.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.956
By the way, the State Championship,

12:40.593 --> 12:43.153
you didn't take your HCM medication,
did you?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.657
- Why would you say that?
- Because I take those pills, Lucas.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.596
We have the same condition.

12:47.666 --> 12:49.998
You can fool other people,
but you can't fool me.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.503
Well, it'll be our secret.

12:52.571 --> 12:55.404
Just promise me you won't do anything
that stupid again, okay?

12:55.474 --> 12:56.736
Your mom's already been through enough.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.175
She needs you healthy and in one piece.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.612
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.584
There you guys are.
What took you so long?

13:07.653 --> 13:10.520
Well, we decided to turn a rental
into a purchase.

13:10.589 --> 13:15.049
I know, I know, I should've cleared it
with you first, but I couldn't help myself.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.926
His idea.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.164
Dan? We need to...
We need to talk about this.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.732
- Talk about what?
- You and him.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.541
And all of this. Everything.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.505
Okay.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.138
How about dinner?
I'll pick you up around 7:00.

13:35.214 --> 13:38.445
- That sounds like a date.
- No. No date.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.519
Just dinner.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.086
Miss Davis.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.230
It's about your calculus exam.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.297
It seems I owe you an apology.

14:04.443 --> 14:05.705
I passed the test!

14:05.778 --> 14:07.939
Turner just apologized.
I guess all my studying paid off.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.504
- How cool is that?
- Congratulations.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.677
Now you're free
to be Victoria Secret's next big thing.

14:13.752 --> 14:14.844
You know it!

14:14.920 --> 14:17.286
Okay, you are good
with all this legal mumbo jumbo,

14:17.356 --> 14:19.290
so what do I do next?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.657
It seems pretty basic.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.457
In addition to your designs,

14:24.530 --> 14:28.091
you just have to turn over the artwork
and you're good to go.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.168
Artwork?

14:40.813 --> 14:42.940
Hey, Principal Turner,
you wanted to see me?

14:43.282 --> 14:45.773
Yes. Please have a seat, Haley.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.822
We've discovered
who stole the calculus exam

14:54.894 --> 14:57.692
and unfortunately, it's someone you know.

15:00.332 --> 15:01.856
Rachel Gatina.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.675
- It's not... Are you sure it's Rachel?
- I've spoken to Miss Gatina.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.210
I'm quite sure.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.836
Haley, you were tutoring her,

15:13.913 --> 15:16.780
and access to that test
was under your direct supervision.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.840
I know. I didn't give her the test...

15:18.918 --> 15:20.385
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I have no choice

15:20.452 --> 15:24.411
but to ask you to resign your position
at the Tutor Center, effective immediately.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.948
- No, look, Principal Turner, listen...
- My decision is final.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.730
And I'll need your key.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.532
I'm sorry it came to this, Haley.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.134
Word of advice.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.070
I might take a good look
at who your real friends are.

15:55.087 --> 15:57.715
- What do you mean you got fired?
- It was Rachel.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.916
I was right about her all along.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.288
She was the one that stole the exam,

16:00.359 --> 16:02.657
and because I was tutoring her,
they let me go.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.719
- Bitch.
- But you had nothing to do with it.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.788
- Didn't you just tell Principal Turner?
- Yeah, I did.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.732
I told him and he said it's school policy.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.158
It just really sucks.

16:11.236 --> 16:14.205
I loved tutoring
and we really needed that extra money.

16:14.273 --> 16:17.436
I'm so sorry, Haley. I know...
I went to bat for her.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.239
I knew it. I knew I was right about her.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.406
I'm sorry. Look, it's not your fault.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.948
I know you were just trying to help her.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.483
Just trying to

16:26.385 --> 16:29.286
be a good guy. It's what I love about you.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.157
I don't feel like such a good guy right now.

16:35.227 --> 16:36.421
Why?

16:36.929 --> 16:39.454
I went to see my mom this morning,

16:40.432 --> 16:42.627
and I think I was kind of hard on her.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.761
Babe, if anybody is in need
of tough love, it's your mom.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.499
I know, but...

16:47.573 --> 16:49.165
She's gonna be released in a few days

16:49.241 --> 16:52.176
and she told me
that she's scared to be alone in the house.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.610
She's gonna slip, Haley. I can feel it.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.944
Well... Well, why don't we do
something about it?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.950
- Like what?
- I don't know.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.748
We need to save money. She needs help.

17:01.820 --> 17:06.086
We could let the apartment go
and move into her house.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.715
Yeah, look, it'd be perfect.

17:07.792 --> 17:11.092
We'd save a ton of money
and we'd be there to watch her 24-7,

17:11.163 --> 17:12.323
and everybody wins.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.161
And Peyton thinks I'm a martyr?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.861
Come on, she's...
You know, she's your family.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.665
She's a train wreck, but she's your mom.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.805
- And you'd do that for her?
- No.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.867
But I'd do that for you.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.285
Okay. My mom gets home in a few days,

17:34.353 --> 17:37.322
and I need this house
to be completely drug and alcohol free.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.879
Let's fan out.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.551
Dude, it's just Nathan's mom.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.860
I mean, how much booze
could we possibly be talking about?

17:50.302 --> 17:54.102
Damn, Nate mom
like the alcoholic Easter Bunny.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.472
- Are we really gonna dump it all?
- Hold on a second.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.011
It's Friday, prom's tomorrow night,

18:00.079 --> 18:02.206
we got a ton of booze, a huge house,

18:02.281 --> 18:04.841
and we just won the State Championship.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.249
I like the way you think, dog.

18:07.319 --> 18:10.686
Hey, you know, with a crib like this,
a brother could definitely get hooked up.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.816
Especially if he got him a new shorty
with some hot leather pants.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.154
You feeling me, Mouth?

18:15.227 --> 18:17.695
Yeah, but, I don't think she is.

18:22.501 --> 18:24.128
What you working on?

18:27.673 --> 18:28.901
Look,

18:31.076 --> 18:32.373
I gotta be honest.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.968
Today, I kind of lied to you.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.913
The book that I gave Glenda
wasn't the <i>Gatsby.</i>

18:39.351 --> 18:41.444
It's one I've been writing.

18:42.387 --> 18:46.289
And I needed an impartial opinion,
so I gave it to her.

18:49.895 --> 18:54.889
I know there's no tenth chapter in <i>Gatsby,</i>

18:55.868 --> 18:58.268
but thank you for telling me the truth.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.066
I'm sorry,

19:00.139 --> 19:03.905
I guess I'm just worried
it's not gonna be good.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.605
Well, what about me?
I'm... I can be impartial.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.306
- I don't think so.
- Why?

19:09.381 --> 19:11.212
Because you're in it.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.742
Give me that book right now.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.183
- No way.
- Please?

19:14.253 --> 19:15.811
It's not ready.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.657
Pretty please with me on top?

19:21.493 --> 19:24.018
Well, I can be persuaded.

19:42.047 --> 19:44.277
Okay. No. Okay, stop, stop, stop.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.010
I don't think so.

19:46.418 --> 19:49.114
Oh, come on. I'll let you read
the first six chapters of my book.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.088
That's very sexy,

19:51.156 --> 19:54.250
but I just want our first time to be special.

19:54.660 --> 19:59.359
And right now it's really not
with a National CD

19:59.431 --> 20:00.557
wedged underneath my back.

20:00.632 --> 20:03.692
Which is a very good album, by the way.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.329
I'm sure your mom's gonna come in
any second.

20:06.939 --> 20:10.306
She's working at the café,
and nobody's gonna walk in.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.408
Okay, my discomfort meter
is pretty much peaked.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.147
Hi. Sorry.

20:25.757 --> 20:29.386
- Luke, can I talk to Peyton for a sec?
- Sure.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.789
Just, you know, if you guys get into it,

20:32.864 --> 20:35.924
try not to break anything expensive.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.541
For the record, I didn't come here to fight.

20:50.949 --> 20:55.113
Victoria's Secret has offered
to franchise Clothes Over Bro's,

20:55.187 --> 21:00.648
so it's a really big, huge deal for me,
but I can't move forward with it

21:00.726 --> 21:04.253
unless you're willing to sign off
on your artwork, so...

21:05.330 --> 21:09.027
I just need to know
what you need for me to make this work.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.096
You have a pen?

21:18.343 --> 21:20.072
What are you doing?

21:21.480 --> 21:24.074
I'm signing over the artwork to you.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.742
They were just sketches, Brooke.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.877
You're the one that turned them
into Clothes Over Bro's.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.189
Congratulations, Brooke.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.421
Are you sure you're comfortable with this?

21:33.492 --> 21:36.461
Sure. I'm happy for you.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.629
You know I love him. I really do.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.868
But I never meant for my love for him
to hurt you.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.172
Thank you, Peyton.

22:00.619 --> 22:02.883
Nathan, what is going on?

22:02.954 --> 22:05.388
Well, we never really got a chance
to celebrate winning State,

22:05.457 --> 22:07.925
and I figured with everything
that's been going on lately,

22:07.993 --> 22:11.827
it might be nice to kick off prom
and have a little...

22:12.164 --> 22:14.894
- Party!
- Party!

22:26.511 --> 22:29.275
Oh, wait, don't look now, Mouth,
but Shelly all up in here right now.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.873
- Where?
- 12:00 and closing fast.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.611
Okay, on the count of three,
we are out of here.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.243
- Ready?
- Three.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.691
So, this is how it's gonna be?
You're just gonna ignore me?

22:44.763 --> 22:47.664
Let me guess, you're here to tell me
you just wanna be friends.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.667
I get it, Shelly. You're not attracted to me.

22:49.735 --> 22:52.431
It's not that. It is just the opposite.

22:52.938 --> 22:55.771
It's because I am attracted to you, Mouth.

22:57.142 --> 22:59.076
I'm just not sure
I trust myself to be with you.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.270
Let me get this straight.

23:00.345 --> 23:04.406
You broke up with me the day before prom
because you're so attracted to me?

23:05.650 --> 23:08.175
Okay, I think I really need a drink.

23:13.992 --> 23:16.153
Dan, this feels like a date.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.391
Let's just call it the mayor
and almost-mayor having dinner.

23:19.464 --> 23:23.059
Karen, I wanna start
being a bigger part of Lucas' life.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.194
He needs a father and I...

23:26.004 --> 23:27.801
I wanna be that father to him,

23:27.873 --> 23:29.534
regardless of
what's happening between us.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.803
I'm pregnant with your brother's child.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.539
There's nothing happening between us.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.142
You're also alone.

23:39.618 --> 23:42.109
And if you need anything,
and I mean anything at all,

23:42.187 --> 23:44.417
I wanna be the man that you turn to.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.457
Luke, you gotta help me
find some booze, man.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.832
It's gonna get ugly down there.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.601
You gotta let this go, man.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.980
Keith's gone, Luke.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.176
Jimmy's gone.

24:15.687 --> 24:18.121
Nothing's gonna bring them back.

24:19.157 --> 24:22.456
But you got a ton of people
that love you out there.

24:22.961 --> 24:27.193
And in a few months, most of those people
are gonna go their separate ways.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.892
So what do you say, big brother?

24:28.967 --> 24:30.901
Let's have some fun.

24:33.839 --> 24:34.863
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.103
Oh, hey, I just wanted to say
congratulations on your calculus test.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.268
Turner told me.

24:39.344 --> 24:42.370
I am really sorry about this morning.
I should never have doubted you.

24:42.447 --> 24:43.744
I never doubted her for a second.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.305
You should be really proud
of yourself, Brooke.

24:45.383 --> 24:48.580
Well, as tempting as it was
to be a senior for another year,

24:48.653 --> 24:51.850
I figured it was probably time
for me to graduate.

24:52.691 --> 24:56.320
- Have you guys seen Rachel?
- She was holding court in the living room.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.555
- Clothed or unclothed?
- Clothed.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.929
But it was about 10 minutes ago,
so you never know.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.737
So, have you written the chapter
where you take your girlfriend

25:10.809 --> 25:13.107
up to that empty bedroom at the party?

25:13.578 --> 25:16.513
Well, I think I may need to do
a little research first.

25:16.581 --> 25:18.708
I was hoping you'd say that.

25:29.728 --> 25:33.323
Thank you, thank you.
Tip your waitresses. Or me.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.968
- So, how did you do it, Rach?
- Do what?

25:39.037 --> 25:40.231
Don't throw dumb-ass at me, girly.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.399
You stole that test,
and I wanna know how you did it.

25:43.475 --> 25:46.273
You steal my key
while I was in the hospital?

25:46.344 --> 25:48.141
Yeah, I bet you did, didn't you?

25:48.213 --> 25:51.205
You know, I could have spent my time
tutoring someone that actually needed it?

25:51.283 --> 25:54.650
And now I'm not gonna have
that opportunity again thanks to you.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.311
- Whatever.
- So...

25:57.889 --> 26:00.016
That is for getting me fired!

26:02.160 --> 26:05.789
And that is for trying
to sleep with my husband.

26:06.364 --> 26:07.626
Bitch, you are lucky you're pregnant.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.132
Honey, you're lucky that I'm pregnant.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.465
I think it's time you get your insecure,
cheating, skank ass

26:12.537 --> 26:14.630
out of this house right now!

26:14.706 --> 26:18.005
- You...
- Yo, ma, I think it's time for you to leave.

26:26.484 --> 26:28.748
Told you I had the kid's back.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.158
Rachel, wait.

26:41.232 --> 26:44.929
What the hell was that?
What did you do to piss off Haley?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.197
It was the exam.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.134
Haley found out I stole it,
and they fired her.

26:54.312 --> 26:55.779
Guess I didn't see that one coming either.

26:55.847 --> 26:58.338
But how? We both passed the re-test.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.818
Not exactly, Copernicus.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.648
Only one of us did.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.936
But why would you do that?

27:27.746 --> 27:29.839
Victoria's Secret, Brooke.

27:31.282 --> 27:32.977
The morals clause.

27:33.985 --> 27:38.547
Besides, I figured I got you into this,
so I wanted to get you out.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.985
You're my friend, Brooke.

27:45.897 --> 27:48.365
What are they gonna do to you now?

27:48.867 --> 27:51.131
Who knows? We'll see.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.966
Brooke, it's okay. I'll be fine.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.669
I'm gonna take off.
Go back in and hang with Chase.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.236
Catch up with you at home.

28:01.579 --> 28:02.807
Rachel,

28:06.718 --> 28:08.117
thank you.

28:20.565 --> 28:24.626
Haley, I heard you were fighting Rachel.
You punched her?

28:24.703 --> 28:26.466
It was more of a bitch-slap.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.268
Yeah, that was after she threw
the drink on her.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.837
I'm okay. Don't worry about me,
I feel fine...

28:32.911 --> 28:34.310
What? What is it? Are you okay?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.813
Yeah, the baby's just really kicking.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.850
- It's kicking?
- Oh, yeah.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.745
I can feel it.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.550
- That's our boy!
- Yeah.

28:49.627 --> 28:50.958
Wow.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.372
Mouth.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.649
- Are you okay?
- No.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.754
I know it's my fault.

29:24.462 --> 29:25.861
I'm sorry.

29:30.001 --> 29:32.026
It's just hard, you know?

29:33.037 --> 29:37.599
I look at you and it hurts so much
to know that we can't be together.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.970
- Mouth...
- I know you're a Clean Teen, Shelly,

29:41.045 --> 29:43.377
but what do you want me to say?

29:43.915 --> 29:46.645
That I don't wanna sleep with you?

29:46.718 --> 29:49.812
That I don't want my first time
to be with you?

29:51.489 --> 29:54.652
Well, I can't say that
'cause that would be a lie.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.361
From the moment I saw you,
I was hooked.

29:59.430 --> 30:03.196
And then I got to look
into those beautiful eyes and kiss you.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.498
And now that's all I wanna do.

30:06.704 --> 30:08.695
I could kiss you forever.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.804
- And I know I'm not good enough.
- No.

30:49.047 --> 30:52.813
So, is this where tomorrow night's
prom queen is hanging out?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.285
What's up?

30:58.890 --> 31:01.154
I'm just worried about Rachel.

31:02.126 --> 31:03.616
That's my girl.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.825
There's a raging party going on
and you're worried about a friend?

31:07.899 --> 31:10.390
You're a good person, Brooke Davis.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.269
You think so?

31:13.304 --> 31:16.296
I've done some things
I'm really not proud of.

31:16.941 --> 31:18.841
You're a good person.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.012
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

31:24.315 --> 31:27.216
Does that mean
you wanna kiss me some more?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.361
Old-school Nathan in the house!

31:49.574 --> 31:51.667
<i>Scott. Nathan Scott.</i>

31:51.743 --> 31:53.574
<i>That's my baby.</i>

31:55.546 --> 31:57.275
Oh, snap!

31:57.348 --> 31:59.976
I thought you and Nathan were married.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.083
Shelly, are you okay?

32:06.157 --> 32:10.184
- I mean... Was that okay?
- Yeah, I... I just gotta find my shirt.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.435
Oh, my bad.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.436
Nice work, though.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.341
Shelly?

32:28.680 --> 32:30.614
Hey, hey, don't cry.

32:30.682 --> 32:33.207
Skills won't tell anyone. I promise.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.085
You don't understand. I gotta go.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.253
But tonight, this, I mean,

32:39.324 --> 32:41.053
this was the start
of something really good.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.888
This was the start of us.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.691
- Can't you feel that?
- I'm a Clean Teen.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.628
I'm the Clean Teen.

32:50.668 --> 32:52.431
I could love you.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.101
I know I could.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.236
But I can't.

33:04.048 --> 33:05.845
Then what was this?

33:13.591 --> 33:15.286
This was goodbye.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.598
Shelly, please don't go.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.828
Mouth, don't call me.

33:24.902 --> 33:27.302
If you really like me,

33:29.040 --> 33:30.667
just let me go.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.292
Thanks for a great evening.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.530
Oh, and thanks for letting Lucas
keep the tux.

34:00.605 --> 34:04.200
Oh, well, I had him try it on.
It looks good on him.

34:04.642 --> 34:07.202
It's better than those blue ruffles.

34:11.748 --> 34:15.310
You know, I'm chaperoning at the prom.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.911
They still need a couple of parents.

34:18.856 --> 34:21.051
You're asking me to the prom?

34:22.927 --> 34:24.918
Yeah, I guess I am.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.063
Okay.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.483
I thought you said you wanted to wait.

34:48.553 --> 34:52.148
Do you remember what you said
the last time we were here?

34:52.223 --> 34:56.420
You said you wanted it all,
and I walked away.

34:59.497 --> 35:03.490
I made a big mistake that night
'cause all I wanted was sex.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.559
And what do you want now?

35:06.137 --> 35:08.230
Now I want what you wanted.

35:09.307 --> 35:11.400
I want everything with you.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.741
There he is.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.177
Big night, dog.
Big night. So, how you feel?

35:50.515 --> 35:53.916
Well, I lost my virginity, my prom date,

35:53.985 --> 35:56.579
and a girl I really could've loved.

35:57.221 --> 35:58.916
All in one night.

36:01.092 --> 36:04.926
Tell you the truth, Skills,
I never felt worse.

36:18.809 --> 36:21.710
- Where's the new boyfriend?
- Taking a break.

36:22.180 --> 36:26.617
When all you do is kiss,
you gotta come up for air once in a while.

36:26.684 --> 36:29.517
Well, he seems
like a really good guy, Chase.

36:29.587 --> 36:33.023
Yeah, he is. I really like him.

36:33.658 --> 36:34.818
Good.

36:40.598 --> 36:43.897
Listen, I'm really sorry about
Haley and the whole Tutor Center thing.

36:43.968 --> 36:47.131
Don't be sorry.
It's not like it was your fault.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.233
Yeah.

36:51.075 --> 36:54.010
So, how come you're not in there,
enjoying your big party?

36:54.078 --> 36:57.479
Well, Skills broke out
the old Ravens game footage.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.579
I swear, when I watch it,
it doesn't even feel like me.

37:01.652 --> 37:05.088
I should hope not. You were such a jerk.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.818
You were dating Peyton
and you guys fought all the time...

37:07.892 --> 37:10.224
Hey, look who's talking?

37:11.295 --> 37:14.128
Are you ever gonna let Peyton off the mat?

37:15.733 --> 37:16.961
Yeah.

37:19.103 --> 37:21.571
I guess it's about time, isn't it?

37:22.106 --> 37:24.040
Yeah, actually, it is.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.905
- Don't move.
- Why?

37:28.713 --> 37:31.011
Nathan, what...

37:31.082 --> 37:32.674
What's going on?

37:33.651 --> 37:35.516
The sprinklers.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.780
What?

37:40.024 --> 37:42.754
You think you're funny? You are so dead!

37:46.664 --> 37:49.224
Oh, I got you. I got you, I got you!

37:50.201 --> 37:54.535
<i>If you could go back</i>
<i>and change just one thing about your life,</i>

37:54.605 --> 37:55.970
<i>would you?</i>

38:01.646 --> 38:06.242
<i>And if you did,</i>
<i>would that change make your life better?</i>

38:43.287 --> 38:46.518
<i>Or would that change</i>
<i>ultimately break your heart?</i>

38:53.531 --> 38:55.761
<i>Or break the heart of another?</i>

39:16.354 --> 39:19.289
<i>Would you choose</i>
<i>an entirely different path?</i>

39:25.096 --> 39:29.556
<i>Or would you change just one thing.</i>
<i>Just one moment.</i>

39:31.202 --> 39:34.137
<i>One moment</i>
<i>that you always wanted back?</i>

39:35.773 --> 39:37.035
<i>Done.</i>

39:45.516 --> 39:47.541
Oh, my God. Is that Nathan?

39:47.618 --> 39:50.348
- Is that Haley?
- I think it's Peyton.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.965
- What's going on out there?
- I don't know.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.558
Dude, you gotta see this!

40:05.636 --> 40:08.298
There's a tape of Peyton
having sex with Nathan.

40:08.372 --> 40:09.839
Oh, my God!

40:18.516 --> 40:20.416
Shut it off!

40:20.484 --> 40:22.111
Shut it off!

40:34.498 --> 40:36.591
<i>Come on, I can't believe I'm doing this.</i>

40:36.667 --> 40:39.568
<i>I would die if anybody saw this, Nathan.</i>

40:39.637 --> 40:42.162
<i>Don't worry, nobody will ever know.</i>
