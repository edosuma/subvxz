WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.545
This location is my revenge
for everything

00:03.628 --> 00:06.006
I've been put through
on this road trip.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.092
CHELSEA: Rituals were performed
at this location.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.761
I just hope it didn't stir up
anything evil.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.471
(SCREAMING)

00:13.555 --> 00:16.808
Every night is a shadow figure
that will roam the halls.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.935
Did you hear that?
It's getting closer.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.520
It's in the woods.
Hello?

00:20.603 --> 00:23.064
It is impossible to move from one
side of the building

00:23.148 --> 00:25.025
to the other so fast.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.526
(CLATTERING)
(SCREAMS)

00:26.609 --> 00:27.944
A glass just broke!

00:28.028 --> 00:29.738
Normally people die
in the buildings.

00:29.821 --> 00:33.033
This time they're bringing remains
into the building.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.702
I'm hearing so much movement,
I think someone's in here.

00:35.785 --> 00:39.247
This was a really bad idea.
We're in someone else's domain.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.166
(YELLING)

00:41.249 --> 00:43.335
Oh, my God.
Alex, in here.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.712
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Where are you?

00:45.795 --> 00:47.464
I can't see anything!

00:48.673 --> 00:50.759
My name is Dakota Laden.

00:50.842 --> 00:54.095
I'm leading my sister and two best
friends on a road trip,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.807
exploring the most haunted locations
in America...

00:57.891 --> 00:59.976
(WOMAN SCREAMING) Oh, my God!

01:06.733 --> 01:08.193
I'm freaked out.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.819
..experimenting with fear

01:09.903 --> 01:13.156
and how it affects our interaction
with the paranormal.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.201
Each night,
we separate and sleep alone.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.830
The catch is - only one of us knows
where we're going.

01:44.062 --> 01:45.605
Ohh!

01:45.689 --> 01:47.607
Let's go!

01:47.691 --> 01:49.776
(WHOOPING AND YELLING)

01:49.859 --> 01:52.779
All right! Here we go! Hey!

02:00.245 --> 02:01.955
It's the one right in the middle.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.291
Oh, the red one, the bull's-eye?
It's the all wood wall.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.378
That's what I'm supposed to hit?
Just like this?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.422
Son of a bitch.
(GROANS)

02:19.264 --> 02:23.059
All right, I sent the team off into
the city to have a bit of fun.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.812
Because they are going to need it.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.941
I have been put through a lot of
punishment on this road trip.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.694
Tanner handcuffed me to a jail cell.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.154
Oh, shit.

02:34.237 --> 02:38.158
Chelsea tortured all of us
with her mystery box pitstop.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.535
Eurgh! I'm not doing this!

02:40.618 --> 02:46.082
And Dakota has some crazy experiment
at every location he's brought us.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.961
Finally, it's my turn.
And no one is safe.

02:50.754 --> 02:54.549
My location is notorious
for its many secrets.

02:57.177 --> 03:02.390
I am taking us to
a 120-year-old decaying compound

03:02.474 --> 03:04.559
in Liberty, Missouri.

03:05.727 --> 03:10.565
Evidence of ritualistic ceremonies
is found throughout the property.

03:10.648 --> 03:15.236
And skeletal remains have actually
been discovered within the walls.

03:16.321 --> 03:20.992
Although this place was originally
established to serve
the disenfranchised,

03:21.076 --> 03:22.994
it instead tormented them

03:23.078 --> 03:27.415
with overcrowding, neglect,
accidents and illness.

03:29.084 --> 03:33.463
With so much tragedy linked to
this 247-acre property,

03:33.963 --> 03:36.341
the paranormal energy
is ever present,

03:37.092 --> 03:39.969
wanting to be seen, heard and felt.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.640
This location is my revenge
for everything

03:43.723 --> 03:46.393
I've been put through
on this road trip.

03:46.476 --> 03:50.355
And much like this property,
I have many secrets up my sleeve

03:50.438 --> 03:51.898
for tomorrow night.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.323
Alex is in the driver's seat.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.033
What do you have planned for us?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.202
Where are we headed, sir?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.081
First and foremost, we are on our
way to Missouri.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.000
Missouri?
Back to Missouri?

04:10.083 --> 04:13.753
I thought I picked a really haunted
place at Missouri on this trip.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.922
What the heck's there?
You did.

04:16.006 --> 04:19.426
But compared to the place I've
found, it's weak sauce, bro.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.594
What the heck could it be?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.889
I'll give you a couple of things
to chew on.

04:24.973 --> 04:30.353
The first thing is, there have been
over 10,000 recorded deaths

04:30.437 --> 04:32.022
on this property.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.358
10,000 deaths?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.652
What kind of place
has 10,000 deaths?

04:37.736 --> 04:41.156
Is there a historical element
you can give us a hint about?

04:41.239 --> 04:42.490
Secrecy.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.577
This place was founded on secrecy.

04:45.660 --> 04:49.122
Have we been anywhere
like this before? No.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.542
Are you guys ready for this?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.711
Why would be excited for your pick?

04:54.794 --> 04:57.881
Fair enough. Chelsea?
No, not at all, actually!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.467
Hm, interesting.
No one's excited for me.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.220
I just feel like you've been
carrying this revenge for so long,

05:04.304 --> 05:06.681
that now you can just totally
get back at us.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.850
Me? Revenge?

05:10.268 --> 05:11.936
Alex, what are we up to now?

05:12.020 --> 05:16.399
Seems like we've been taking
a lot of shots at each other
on this road trip.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.693
Is that fair to say?
That's very fair to say.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.695
We've all put each other
through hell.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.864
And it's time to put an end to it.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.868
Well, we are actually headed
to a place where we will

05:26.951 --> 05:29.371
literally be taking shots
at each other.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.830
What are we doing?

05:30.914 --> 05:33.917
Right now, we are headed
to this cool place that I found

05:34.000 --> 05:37.837
where we will be playing
a few rounds of paintball.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.757
Are you serious?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.551
I'm not gonna speak for everyone
but I have a feeling

05:43.635 --> 05:47.764
we're at that point of the trip where
we do just want to shoot each other
with paintballs.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.933
I think this is pretty good.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.727
How are we gonna do it?
Is it just a free-for-all?

05:52.811 --> 05:56.564
We should play two on two and just
draw out of the hat for teams.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.733
I like that.
Leave it up to fate.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.778
I can hunt me a mean ghost
but I can't shoot a paintball gun.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.447
I might shoot my own teammate.
I don't know.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.701
I really don't want Chelsea
on my team now!

06:09.994 --> 06:12.080
Anyone else nervous?
Yes.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.083
Where's the paintball, a cave?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.585
Yeah, it's actually
a limestone quarry.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.754
What?
Limestone?

06:19.838 --> 06:23.508
The team that has the most paint
on them has to run the gauntlet.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.553
I'm so sorry for my teammate.
Let's do this.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.222
It's me and Tanner
versus Chelsea and Alex.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.391
Team two!
We got this, Chels.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.982
All right, game on!

06:39.065 --> 06:40.316
Go!

06:41.568 --> 06:43.653
You can go.
I'm scared!

06:44.446 --> 06:46.156
Get up!

06:46.239 --> 06:49.367
I got hit. Got to run back.
Yes!

06:51.745 --> 06:53.413
(YELLING)

06:53.496 --> 06:55.582
Dakota versus Chelsea.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.127
Get up!
Oh, I'm hit!

06:59.210 --> 07:00.962
I'm hit!
Yeah!

07:11.681 --> 07:13.767
(LAUGHS)

07:14.768 --> 07:17.270
Let's go, Chels, let's go! Now, now!

07:17.354 --> 07:20.482
OK. We quit!
We quit!

07:20.565 --> 07:22.567
Come out with your hands up!

07:22.650 --> 07:24.235
OK. Good game.

07:24.319 --> 07:28.740
Nice job, guys. When I chased you,
Chelsea lit me up in the back.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.367
That was our move.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.619
Chelsea, did you even get hit?
Nope.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.456
That means we have to run
the gauntlet because we lost. Yeah!

07:37.374 --> 07:38.541
Go!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.710
(GUNS FIRING)

07:45.924 --> 07:47.425
My leg!

07:47.509 --> 07:50.637
I have so much adrenaline,
I can't even feel the pain.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.180
We got you.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.558
It almost didn't hurt cos
the adrenaline was pumping so bad.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.560
If you thought
the gauntlet was scary,

07:57.644 --> 08:01.064
wait until you see the information
I put together for this packet.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.358
Let's get out of here.
Good job, guys.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.860
Good job, guys.
Let's go read the packet.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.168
All right, we're rolling.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.258
What are you doing?
Sitting down, guys. What's wrong?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.760
Creeping me out already.
Let's get started.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.430
There is a lot to get through
in this packet.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.098
Dakota?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.809
All right.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.814
BOTH: The Odd Fellows Home?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.034
Nope.
You know about the place, don't you?

08:54.117 --> 08:58.163
It makes a lot of sense now why you
were talking about secrets earlier.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.332
Can you let us in on this secret?
I'm completely clueless.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.501
Wait until you read this.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.671
"The Odd Fellows Home.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.091
Founded in the early 1900s
by a secret society

09:10.175 --> 09:13.011
known as the Independent Order
of Odd Fellows,

09:13.094 --> 09:17.390
the creepy and decrepit compound
consists of a former orphanage,

09:17.474 --> 09:20.727
nursing home, hospital
and old folks' home.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.606
Though it officially closed
almost 30 years ago,

09:24.689 --> 09:28.151
the former orphanage has since
renovated into a winery and inn

09:28.234 --> 09:30.320
and guests leave
in the middle of the night

09:30.403 --> 09:32.822
after being spooked
out of their rooms."

09:32.906 --> 09:35.909
There is something still haunting
these hallways.

09:35.992 --> 09:39.662
Even though it's very clearly dead,
there is still something here.

09:40.205 --> 09:43.166
"Dating back to 17th-century England,

09:43.249 --> 09:47.295
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows
is a highly private brotherhood

09:47.379 --> 09:49.464
that still exists to this day."

09:49.547 --> 09:53.551
The Odd Fellows were the second
largest fraternal order
in the world,

09:53.635 --> 09:55.387
following only the Masons.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.557
They started in Europe, moved over
here when the colonies were created

09:59.641 --> 10:02.018
and they created
a large organisation.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.688
"The organisation
is charitable in nature,

10:04.771 --> 10:07.816
with a motto preaching friendship,
love and truth."

10:07.899 --> 10:10.735
They were all about helping anyone
who joined the Odd Fellows

10:10.819 --> 10:14.489
but they do seem to have lots of
secrets people don't talk about.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.910
"In fact, it has only been
in the past few decades

10:18.993 --> 10:22.664
that hints of what goes on in their
rituals have been unearthed.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.833
And it borders on the macabre."

10:24.916 --> 10:27.502
You had to touch
the remains of past members,

10:27.585 --> 10:30.088
you had to wear masks
with human hair on it.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.966
Lots of shady things happening,
it seems like.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.927
"In the 1990s and early 2000s,

10:36.011 --> 10:38.805
many Odd Fellow lodges
across the United States

10:38.888 --> 10:41.808
were bought by people
outside the organisation.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.437
As these new owners began
renovations, knocking down walls,

10:45.520 --> 10:48.815
construction workers made
grizzly discoveries.

10:49.649 --> 10:54.070
Fully intact human skeletons
had been buried behind the walls."

10:56.031 --> 10:58.116
The specific portion of the ritual

10:58.199 --> 11:00.618
where they take
a blindfolded initiate,

11:00.702 --> 11:02.245
bring them in front of a coffin

11:02.328 --> 11:04.706
and then they present them
with the skeleton.

11:05.957 --> 11:10.253
"The practice required
the use of real human remains."

11:10.337 --> 11:13.757
I mean, normally people die
in the buildings that we go to.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.886
This time, they're bringing remains
into the building.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.556
That's got to be something different
we've never had to deal with.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.601
That'll probably bring about
a different type of haunting.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.230
"The Odd Fellows built up complexes
throughout the US.

11:29.314 --> 11:34.319
One of the most prominent ones was
a compound in Liberty, Missouri."

11:34.402 --> 11:37.238
"The complex eventually
had so many residents,

11:37.322 --> 11:41.326
that by the 1950s, the staff
was severely outnumbered,

11:41.409 --> 11:43.495
leading to extensive neglect."

11:43.578 --> 11:46.998
There were orphans that had drowned
in the lake that was out front.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.417
There were people that had vanished.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.588
There were over 10,000 recorded
deaths on site.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.383
It wasn't necessarily a situation
where they were curing you

11:56.466 --> 11:58.593
and creating miracles,
it didn't happen.

11:58.677 --> 12:02.889
I mean, this whole property is just
covered in death head to toe.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.100
Gosh.
Dude.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.311
Just wait until you hear my plan.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.480
When are you gonna tell us that?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.565
Tomorrow.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.734
Awesome. Great.
Keep reading.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.487
"The nursing home.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.948
Time has stood still
in this building."

12:20.031 --> 12:22.283
The nursing home
is unsettling for me.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.745
There's still old bedpans,
old wheelchairs.

12:26.621 --> 12:30.291
It basically looks like they just
got up and left that building.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.005
I don't really like the nursing home
to be honest with you.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.673
I don't feel as welcome.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.009
Especially the morgue area
in the basement.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.511
I don't feel comfortable
in there at all.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.597
"People have been pushed down here.

12:44.681 --> 12:49.185
Others have been deeply scratched and
women routinely get earrings tugged."

12:50.979 --> 12:52.731
"The old folks' home.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.816
Attached to the nursing home,

12:54.899 --> 12:57.777
this building was housing
for the elderly residents

12:57.861 --> 12:59.946
who required less one-on-one care.

13:00.030 --> 13:04.034
People hate going into this building
especially at night.

13:05.160 --> 13:11.124
It is incredibly noisy with giggles,
knocks and bangs heard constantly."

13:11.207 --> 13:13.293
(WOMAN GIGGLING)

13:14.336 --> 13:17.380
When you cross over the hallway
into the old folks' home,

13:17.464 --> 13:20.884
you can feel an energy change.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.803
There's a lot of eyes on you.

13:23.887 --> 13:26.681
We've had people see full-bodied
apparitions,

13:26.765 --> 13:30.977
little bitty red and green orbs
flying through the air.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.146
I've experienced that several times.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.776
"Located all the way
to the left of the grounds,

13:37.859 --> 13:42.113
the hospital has the most malevolent
dark energy of anywhere
on the property."

13:42.197 --> 13:44.657
It almost feels like you can't
breathe over there.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.785
Every night there's a shadow figure

13:46.868 --> 13:49.871
that will roam the halls
of the hospital building.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.500
He is very scary, he's very heavy,
he's very intense.

13:54.459 --> 13:59.130
It is said if you get in his way,
he will just walk right through you

13:59.214 --> 14:02.217
and you will just kind of feel
all of that darkness.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.055
"People report having their hair
violently tugged

14:07.138 --> 14:10.392
and becoming suddenly sick
and light-headed in here."

14:10.475 --> 14:12.102
This is gonna suck!

14:12.185 --> 14:16.022
Wait until you see the size
of these buildings too. Take a look.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.650
Oh, my goodness!

14:21.945 --> 14:25.073
I know that rituals were performed
at this location.

14:25.156 --> 14:28.952
I just hope it didn't stir up
anything really evil

14:29.035 --> 14:31.454
or something
that's completely unwanted.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.164
I'm not looking forward to that.

14:33.248 --> 14:37.002
We're getting really close.
Tanner and Chelsea, head up front.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.754
(GROANS)
All right, let's do this.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.590
No way!

14:42.674 --> 14:45.969
The road's called Odd Fellows.
We are close.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.471
Oh, God!

14:49.347 --> 14:52.559
Oh, my God!
Oh, no way!

14:53.810 --> 14:56.479
Dude, look at that!
Holy crap!

14:56.563 --> 14:58.648
Are you kidding, Alex?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.817
This place is huge!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.694
This is insane!

15:05.405 --> 15:06.990
(LAUGHS)

15:07.073 --> 15:09.743
You guys, are you ready?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.244
No!

15:11.327 --> 15:13.747
Dude, get out of here!
Look at this place!

15:13.830 --> 15:16.541
Odd Fellows Home. Seriously?

15:16.624 --> 15:19.336
Holy crap! I feel like
we're in a horror movie.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.504
Alex, this is terrifying!

15:21.588 --> 15:23.673
It's messed up.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.468
Even the land we're surrounded by
looks scary.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.927
Yep.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.096
Come on!

15:30.180 --> 15:32.265
After you, guys.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.230
So we just got to
the Odd Fellows Home.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.108
We set up a gear room
in the orphanage behind me.

15:42.192 --> 15:46.237
I think right now we should go
explore this place as a group.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.742
It's so far away, guys.
I know.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.911
This is gonna suck.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.080
This whole place is creepy, dude.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.877
Here's the hospital.
It's way over here?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.712
Are you serious?

16:02.796 --> 16:06.257
Apparently there is something
very dark in this hospital.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.303
People have said to be chased out
by shadow figures.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.020
Oh, my gosh!

16:19.104 --> 16:22.691
This is super, super rundown.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.528
I'm gonna put my mask on.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.290
Is there anyone down here?

16:40.709 --> 16:42.794
I don't feel good about this place.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.383
(CLATTERING)
Did you hear that, upstairs?

16:48.466 --> 16:50.552
That was a loud thud right above us.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.970
Ssh.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.642
How do we get upstairs?
Back towards the front.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.811
We should just check.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.567
Hello, can you make another noise?

17:08.737 --> 17:10.822
We heard you. Can you do it again?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.458
Can you make that noise again?

17:30.342 --> 17:32.427
It definitely came from up here.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.389
It's creepy, cos we were only in here
for a minute before it started.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.435
(THUD)
Whoa! Fuck that! Shit!

17:40.518 --> 17:42.604
That was high-pitched.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.314
Like metal.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.483
Like metal dropping on the ground.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.651
Before it started...

17:48.735 --> 17:50.820
(THUDDING)
Whoa!

17:51.613 --> 17:53.406
(THUDDING)
Whoa!

17:53.490 --> 17:55.575
What the hell was that?

18:00.622 --> 18:02.999
Just keep going
to where the noises are.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.587
Dude, what the hell was that?

18:07.671 --> 18:12.175
I mean, part of the building is
totally outside right now.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.389
Every time when we least expect it,
there's a noise.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.894
Can you make a noise in which
direction you want us to go?

18:29.442 --> 18:33.071
This is the first building we've
been in and I am so freaked out.

18:33.154 --> 18:36.700
Is it just waiting for us now?
What do you think's happening?

18:36.783 --> 18:39.119
Either there's just
a lot of natural noises here,

18:39.202 --> 18:41.496
but I've never been
to a building that has...

18:41.579 --> 18:44.374
(CLATTERING)
Holy shit! The glass just broke!

18:44.457 --> 18:46.543
Glass just broke!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.712
Holy crap!

18:48.795 --> 18:50.672
Can you see what window
it came from?

18:50.755 --> 18:54.384
No. No, a lot of the windows
have broken glass on them.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.637
(DOGS BARK IN DISTANCE)

18:57.721 --> 19:00.724
Dogs are barking.
Dogs are barking super loud now.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.352
Hello?

19:04.436 --> 19:06.521
OK, what the hell?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.483
Have we looked in every room?
I'm looking now.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.612
Make sure there's no one
in any of these rooms.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.617
There's nowhere else to look.

19:19.701 --> 19:23.079
I feel like there's someone in here
with the amount of noises we hear.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.665
It sounds like someone
is in the building.

19:25.749 --> 19:28.585
I disagree. It is impossible
for a person to move

19:28.668 --> 19:32.088
from one side of the building
to the other so fast.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.257
What shall we do, Alex?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.594
I mean, maybe we whip out the Ovilus

19:37.677 --> 19:39.637
and ask some questions,

19:39.721 --> 19:43.350
see if we can get any answers
to the noises we've been hearing.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.436
If there's somebody here
and you can hear my voice,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.605
you can use this thing in my hand

19:48.688 --> 19:51.483
and you can talk to us,
choose one word at a time.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.404
We know that you're here,
we could hear you.

19:56.488 --> 19:59.282
We heard a metal pipe,
we heard glass breaking.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.832
If there's a dark entity here,
why are you here?

20:07.916 --> 20:10.001
Why this hospital?

20:12.754 --> 20:14.839
We're gonna be here all night.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.759
Do you have any type of warning
for us?

20:19.594 --> 20:21.680
(NOISE ON OVILUS)
What?

20:21.763 --> 20:23.848
"Property."

20:23.932 --> 20:26.017
Were you buried on this property?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.773
Were you someone who stayed here?
Were you a part of the Odd Fellows?

20:35.610 --> 20:39.989
I want to know what the agenda
of this organisation was.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.158
Like, what was the true agenda?

20:42.242 --> 20:44.452
I mean, it's weird because
the Odd Fellows,

20:44.536 --> 20:46.287
their whole motto was peaceful,

20:46.371 --> 20:48.665
it was supposed to be
a community thing,

20:48.748 --> 20:50.834
they were taking in orphans.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.628
But then you throw in, like,
weird rituals...

20:53.712 --> 20:56.881
I cannot believe that people would
actually donate their body

20:56.965 --> 20:59.050
back to the society when they died.

20:59.134 --> 21:02.137
Especially with them knowing
what it was used for.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.806
What are the things
that they had to follow,

21:04.889 --> 21:07.726
things that are unwritten
but people just know?

21:07.809 --> 21:10.562
I feel like this place has already
been so active,

21:10.645 --> 21:12.856
it's got a whole different
type of energy.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.025
Ssh!

21:15.108 --> 21:17.193
(DISTANT HOOTING)

21:17.277 --> 21:19.070
Is that owls?

21:19.154 --> 21:21.239
It sounded like multiple owls.

21:21.322 --> 21:24.284
Talking about a secret society
and owls start freaking...

21:24.367 --> 21:26.453
(NOISE ON OVILUS)
"Outside."

21:26.536 --> 21:28.621
OK.
"Outside."

21:28.705 --> 21:30.331
What?

21:30.415 --> 21:32.500
What the hell, dude?

21:32.584 --> 21:34.794
That was, like, multiple owls.
Yeah.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.963
I do not like this at all.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.132
Freaking creepy, man.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.509
It's a really creepy time
to hear owls.

Person. Swear to God.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.765
Person, person, person.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.434
Grab my camera.
Holy crap! There, I see him!

21:49.517 --> 21:52.312
There's someone right here.
A person just ran across-

21:52.395 --> 21:54.481
Shh! Guys, guys, guys.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.733
There's, like, someone sneaking on.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.695
I just saw a light.
See that fucking light?

22:00.779 --> 22:02.197
(CLATTERING)

22:02.280 --> 22:04.366
There's someone actually outside.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.410
Lights down, Chelsea.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.829
There is someone right there.
Behind the tree line.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.790
He's in the woods.
He's in the woods.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.127
(DOG HOWLS IN DISTANCE)

22:24.803 --> 22:27.097
(THUD)
Did you hear that? In the woods.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.265
Getting closer.
Behind the woods.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.684
Hello?

22:31.643 --> 22:33.812
Yeah, there he is.
He's in the trees.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.980
Hey!
He's running. He's running.

22:40.652 --> 22:42.737
I lost him. Shit.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.906
Hello?

22:46.116 --> 22:48.326
What the hell.
It was just one person?

22:48.410 --> 22:51.204
Yeah, just one person.
He ran into these woods.

22:51.287 --> 22:55.166
What is his intention? It's one
person breaking into the building.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.545
They could come in
at any time right now.

23:01.715 --> 23:05.802
I find it very odd we were barely
getting anything on the Ovilus

23:05.885 --> 23:08.179
and the only two things
that we got were

23:09.097 --> 23:10.974
"outside" and "property".

23:11.057 --> 23:13.101
And then someone came
onto the property.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.187
Almost like it was protecting us.
I'm not kidding.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.356
No, that's a really good point.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.525
I would like to do
a property search.

23:20.608 --> 23:24.195
Just a quick sweep around
just to make sure we're OK.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.871
It was right here in these woods.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.834
This is so thick.

23:39.878 --> 23:42.756
Whoever that was was not worried
about getting hurt.

23:42.839 --> 23:46.718
I dunno, like, I wouldn't run through
these woods. These are thick.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.720
Oh, my gosh!

23:48.803 --> 23:50.805
I don't see anything, guys.

23:50.889 --> 23:54.142
Whoever it was,
they're still here and hiding?

23:54.225 --> 23:56.436
Or they dipped out?
I just don't know.

24:00.315 --> 24:03.026
I think we should definitely
keep exploring.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.529
We have a lot to see tonight
and this is just the beginning.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.073
All right.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.410
The fact that we don't know
if there's a person
in one of these buildings

24:12.494 --> 24:14.579
has me completely freaked out.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.748
And on edge.

24:18.917 --> 24:22.504
We just had a very scary encounter.

24:22.587 --> 24:25.757
And now we are gonna go
explore the nursing home.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.343
This is the building
that the morgue is at.

24:28.426 --> 24:31.388
And they say
there's a dark energy here.

24:32.347 --> 24:35.684
There's even been reports
that people hear piano music.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.852
If you look right here...

24:37.936 --> 24:39.729
Not a chance!

24:39.813 --> 24:41.898
There's no music coming from that.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.067
Hey, Dakota, I have an idea.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.361
No. I just thought of it.
No, I'm good.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.530
No, I just thought of it.
What?

24:48.613 --> 24:52.117
Want to walk to the end of this
hallway? Of course I do!

24:52.200 --> 24:55.453
It just seems like a really nice
hallway, very inviting.

24:55.537 --> 25:00.000
It looks exactly like a place you
should do a walk-down to the end.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.669
What the shit!
It goes way down there!

25:02.752 --> 25:04.838
We'll follow you after.

25:04.921 --> 25:08.383
I'm not gonna argue it because
I know I don't have an option.

(SIGHS) Son of a bitch.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.267
Oh, crap.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.565
It's a long hallway.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.942
Let us know if the morgue
is down there.

25:26.026 --> 25:28.111
I will. I freaking will.

25:30.989 --> 25:33.074
Is anybody down here?

25:36.119 --> 25:39.039
Oh, dude, it breaks off
super far to the left, too.

25:54.846 --> 25:56.931
Is there somebody down here?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.645
Can you make a noise?

26:07.067 --> 26:09.152
What is down here?

26:23.249 --> 26:25.335
Did you find the morgue yet?

26:25.418 --> 26:28.755
Holy shit! You guys are so far away,
I can hardly hear you.

26:28.838 --> 26:31.049
I don't think
the morgue is down here.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.801
Let's go down there.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.344
We're coming down.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.430
Nothing down there,
just a ton of destroyed rooms.

26:37.514 --> 26:40.350
But down there...
I haven't been down there yet.

26:41.393 --> 26:44.854
Let's go down that way because
the morgue is not down there.

26:44.938 --> 26:47.524
But you can lead. I'm not doing that.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.360
I'm glad you did it.
Thanks for the challenge, Al.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.195
Do you feel accomplished?
Kind of.

26:52.278 --> 26:56.950
But I was thinking about ghosts
jumping out at me
and also a freaking person too.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.119
And that's not fun.

27:01.246 --> 27:03.331
Is there somebody here with us?

27:03.415 --> 27:06.835
(GLASS CRACKING UNDERFOOT)
There's so much glass, guys.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.255
(CLATTER)
Oh, my gosh!

27:10.338 --> 27:12.841
A dog kennel. What the hell?

27:14.175 --> 27:16.886
This building is, like,
completely run down.

27:18.346 --> 27:20.432
This is disgusting.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.938
I would never have guessed
this is the morgue.

27:27.022 --> 27:29.733
I can't even take a guess
of where things were.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.944
10,000 people died here.

27:33.028 --> 27:35.196
That is a lot of death
and mortality.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.701
Right, Al, where are we going next?

27:39.784 --> 27:41.161
(SIGHS)

27:41.244 --> 27:43.329
Actually, guys...

27:43.413 --> 27:46.458
I think it's time for us
to separate and sleep alone.

27:46.541 --> 27:49.169
ALL: What? It's so early.
What are you talking about?

27:49.252 --> 27:51.212
Dude, hell, no!
Already?

27:51.296 --> 27:55.925
Usually, we separate and sleep alone
for three, four hours.

27:56.009 --> 28:00.555
But tonight we are going to sleep
alone for six to seven hours.

28:00.638 --> 28:02.724
Dude, seriously?
That long?

28:02.807 --> 28:05.602
And we know someone was, like,
on the property.

28:05.685 --> 28:09.564
Alex, I saw somebody on the property
and you're still gonna do this?

28:09.647 --> 28:12.776
How was I supposed to know
that that was gonna happen?

28:13.651 --> 28:16.279
I'm not just gonna change
my whole gameplan-

28:16.363 --> 28:18.948
I just don't think
this is a good idea at all.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.117
Trust me. I feel like a jerk.

28:21.201 --> 28:24.079
But I get one shot at a location

28:24.162 --> 28:26.790
and I'm not letting anything
mess my plan up.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.959
Oh, man. I mean, I would do the same.

28:30.043 --> 28:32.462
I think we all would probably
do the same.

28:36.049 --> 28:38.468
The reason why we are sleeping alone
is because we believe

28:38.551 --> 28:41.888
when you are alone and isolated
it brings about the fear.

28:41.971 --> 28:45.809
We've all agreed on the four scariest
locations for us to go sleep.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.645
First we have the hospital.

28:48.728 --> 28:52.899
The hospital is said to be the most
malevolent haunting of the property.

28:52.982 --> 28:56.361
And then we have the morgue
in the nursing home.

28:56.444 --> 28:59.572
People have reported getting
their hair tugged, scratched.

28:59.656 --> 29:03.743
Our next two locations are in the old
folks' home where none of us
have been.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.955
And those two are: the east wing
of the old folks' home

29:07.038 --> 29:10.417
and the west wing
of the old folks' home.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.919
Those are our four scariest places.

29:13.003 --> 29:16.131
Tanner will write them on
a piece of paper and we'll draw.

29:16.214 --> 29:19.259
That's where you go sleep for the
rest of the night, for six hours.

29:19.342 --> 29:21.428
A lot longer than normal.

29:21.511 --> 29:24.472
All right, who is going to draw?
Dakota.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.641
I'm drawing first?
Oh, yeah.

29:26.725 --> 29:30.270
50% chance you'll be with someone,
100% chance it's haunted.

29:30.353 --> 29:32.022
Love it.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.527
West Wing, Old Folks' Home.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.154
Ohh!

29:39.237 --> 29:41.114
I don't know what to think.

29:41.197 --> 29:43.408
Let's just go in order.
Let's go Chelsea next.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.368
Chelsea!
(IMITATES WIND WHISTLING)

29:45.452 --> 29:49.330
Don't make that sound!
Like, I'm already screwed!

29:49.414 --> 29:51.499
(LAUGHS)
Tanner!

29:51.583 --> 29:54.252
So nervous.
I smile when I'm nervous.

29:57.047 --> 30:00.342
Ohh, the nursing home morgue!

30:00.425 --> 30:03.470
Whoa! (LAUGHS)
Oh, no!

30:03.553 --> 30:05.638
That's terrible!

30:05.722 --> 30:07.807
This is not a good spot.

30:07.891 --> 30:10.101
Tanner, you want to decide
our fates?

30:10.185 --> 30:12.979
This is very important
for both of us right now.

30:13.063 --> 30:16.274
Yeah, a lot rides on this, man.

30:16.358 --> 30:19.778
I either have the best spot
or the worst spot.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.321
Oh, snap.

30:23.448 --> 30:25.200
God!
No?

30:25.283 --> 30:27.369
I got the hospital!

30:27.452 --> 30:28.828
Ohh!

30:28.912 --> 30:30.997
(GROANS) Why?

30:31.081 --> 30:34.834
Remember when someone was trying
to break in? Yeah, I remember.

30:34.918 --> 30:37.754
Dude, honestly, screw this,
everything about it.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.464
Hate it, don't like it.

30:39.547 --> 30:43.802
That leaves me with
the east wing, old folks' home.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.595
This is really awkward.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.932
But now would be a bad time
to bring up my real challenge.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.226
Your real challenge?
Real challenge?

30:51.309 --> 30:53.395
It's more of a two-part challenge.

30:53.478 --> 30:56.898
This might actually piss every
single one of you off a lot.

30:58.942 --> 31:01.027
But I'm gonna need your flashlights.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.823
Someone came onto the property.

31:05.365 --> 31:08.993
And you're gonna not only make us
sleep alone for twice as long

31:09.077 --> 31:12.831
but now you're taking away
our only light source?

31:12.914 --> 31:15.917
Let me ask you this - why?
Is there a reason for this?

31:16.001 --> 31:19.421
The reason we sleep alone is
because it brings about the fear.

31:19.504 --> 31:22.382
Taking away the light
is only going to increase that.

31:22.465 --> 31:25.969
I think we're doing just fine
with the flashlights.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.804
You're a real piece of shit.

31:27.887 --> 31:31.224
To be honest, after what
we experienced right away
in the hospital,

31:31.307 --> 31:33.059
this is probably a terrible idea.

31:33.143 --> 31:35.228
But again, I only get one location.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.981
And it's time, it is time to do it.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.150
All right, hand them over, guys.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.318
Drop them in.

31:45.238 --> 31:47.407
There you go. There's my flashlight.

31:47.490 --> 31:50.410
Got a bag full of flashlights.
Oh, and he threw it.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.329
Just threw it away.
We don't have flashlights now, guys.

31:53.413 --> 31:55.248
Well, this is great!

31:55.331 --> 31:57.709
All right, all,
let's go get in our cots.

31:57.792 --> 31:59.878
I want my flashlight back.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.014
This is gonna be a long night.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.275
This was a really bad idea.

32:33.078 --> 32:36.831
OK, I just want you guys to see how
freaking dark this actually is.

32:37.624 --> 32:39.709
So that's my sleeping arrangement.

32:39.793 --> 32:41.878
That's what I see - nothing.

32:41.961 --> 32:43.713
Pitch black.

32:43.797 --> 32:45.882
This sucks.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.727
(THUDDING)
Holy shit!

32:59.437 --> 33:01.523
It sounded like a knock on the door.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.111
Is something here with me?

33:08.113 --> 33:10.198
I'm hearing walking.

33:16.746 --> 33:19.124
I truly don't know what to do
about this.

33:19.207 --> 33:23.086
If it's something weird and
paranormal, I want to know what.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.132
I just feel like someone's
in this building right now.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.015
This is not something
that I want to say

33:35.098 --> 33:38.435
but I know that my brother
would want me to say this.

33:38.518 --> 33:42.147
There is a music box on the ground
turned on.

33:42.230 --> 33:46.317
You can turn that music box on
by stepping in front of it.

33:48.153 --> 33:49.696
But feel free to not.

33:49.779 --> 33:51.865
That is totally fine too.

33:51.948 --> 33:54.034
I'd actually prefer that.

34:08.798 --> 34:10.216
(THUDDING)

34:10.300 --> 34:11.843
Holy shit.

34:11.926 --> 34:13.636
That's above me.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.723
I just heard the loudest stomp
above me.

34:16.806 --> 34:19.559
That was either something falling
off the ceiling

34:19.642 --> 34:21.728
or someone walking up there.

34:31.863 --> 34:33.573
(THUDDING)
Whoa!

34:34.991 --> 34:36.743
What is...

34:36.826 --> 34:38.912
Oh, my God!

34:38.995 --> 34:42.332
I just heard something moving
above me.

34:43.541 --> 34:46.044
If there's something above me
and you can hear me,

34:46.127 --> 34:48.213
can you come down to this floor?

34:49.923 --> 34:52.342
Hey, Dakota,
are you exploring already?

34:52.425 --> 34:54.511
No, I'm on the first floor in my cot.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.305
But I am hearing stuff above me.

34:57.389 --> 35:01.685
Dude, are you kidding? I thought you
were walking round upstairs already!

35:01.768 --> 35:05.271
No, I am not. I honestly was hoping
that was you above me.

35:05.355 --> 35:07.023
We have to explore.

35:07.107 --> 35:09.192
We have to look round the building.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.653
OK, well, I'm going
to find the staircase

35:11.736 --> 35:14.155
and try to make my way
up to the second floor,

35:14.239 --> 35:16.741
just to see if there is anything
that could have moved.

35:16.825 --> 35:18.576
All right, I'm gonna do the same.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.621
Literally, I'm just looking through
my LCD screen.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.790
I don't know where I'm walking.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.669
This is the staircase.

35:29.462 --> 35:31.548
I'm gonna go up.

35:37.971 --> 35:40.056
This is so hard to walk.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.647
Hello?

35:50.984 --> 35:53.028
Alex?
Yo!

35:53.111 --> 35:56.489
Where are you? I don't know, dude,
I can't see anything.

35:56.573 --> 35:58.616
I can't see shit, dude.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.326
Yo.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.454
Oh, my God. OK, I see you.

36:02.537 --> 36:05.123
What the hell was that?
I heard, like, thuds.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.250
Like, dumm, dumm, dumm.

36:07.334 --> 36:10.628
I dunno what to think about this
place. I'm already regretting it.

36:10.712 --> 36:13.298
We should look around. I don't even
know what to look for.

36:13.381 --> 36:16.301
We'll just see if anything
is out of the ordinary.

36:17.594 --> 36:21.431
Just to show everyone really quick.
This is how dark it is in here.

36:22.307 --> 36:25.518
I can only see Alex's camera
red light and green light.

36:28.521 --> 36:30.607
Hello?

36:31.399 --> 36:34.110
People have heard
children giggling in here.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.822
People have also seen shadow figures
in here.

36:37.906 --> 36:39.949
Is there somebody up here?

36:40.033 --> 36:44.204
Can you move something now that we're
up here? Can you make a noise again?

36:45.288 --> 36:47.374
I can't see a thing.
Me neither.

36:58.385 --> 37:00.470
(THUD)
What the fuck?

37:01.846 --> 37:04.349
Something just moved
fucking back there.

37:05.225 --> 37:07.268
There's a window back there.

37:07.352 --> 37:11.564
I can't see past that because
my camera's IR light is blinding.

37:16.695 --> 37:20.365
I'm hearing so much fucking movement
I think someone's in here.

37:21.783 --> 37:23.827
I don't see anything.

37:23.910 --> 37:25.995
Tanner to Dakota.
Oh, my gosh!

37:27.706 --> 37:29.666
Yeah, go for Dakota.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.127
No one's up here with me, right?
No, dude.

37:32.210 --> 37:34.796
Me and Alex are on the second floor
of the old folks' home

37:34.879 --> 37:36.923
cos we are hearing stuff above us.

37:37.007 --> 37:39.092
I just saw something move up here.

37:40.051 --> 37:42.637
Like, I'm standing up
and I'm holding my camera.

37:42.721 --> 37:45.306
I'm too freaked out to walk
down the hallway.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.684
You are alone.
I don't know what to say.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.354
Seriously, check in with us in,
like, five.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.942
This is legitimately the most
freaked out I've ever been.

37:56.026 --> 37:59.446
I'm trying to stay calm, cool and
collected and it's not working.

38:00.864 --> 38:03.366
I saw something move
right past this door.

38:04.784 --> 38:06.828
I don't know what to do.

38:06.911 --> 38:08.997
I can't see anything.

38:14.669 --> 38:17.047
I don't even know
what to look for up here.

38:17.130 --> 38:18.340
I can't tell.

38:18.423 --> 38:21.301
Everything's so out of place,
all over the place.

38:21.384 --> 38:24.137
It'd almost be impossible
to figure out what we just heard.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.681
We are in someone else's domain
right now.

38:26.765 --> 38:28.808
We are not welcome.

38:28.892 --> 38:32.312
I'll go back to my side and we'll
just keep in touch, I guess.

38:32.395 --> 38:34.481
Yeah.
Good luck.

38:34.564 --> 38:35.857
Good luck.

38:35.940 --> 38:39.110
Oh, my gosh. I actually hate this.

38:40.570 --> 38:42.739
I have no idea what me
and Alex heard.

38:42.822 --> 38:46.576
I honestly feel like whatever
it was is moving around upstairs,

38:46.659 --> 38:49.996
moving around this building,
it is not stuck in one spot.

39:07.597 --> 39:10.308
No! Stop.

39:10.392 --> 39:12.227
(MUSIC BOX TINKLING)

39:13.645 --> 39:15.397
Oh, my God.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.565
The music box just went off.

39:19.901 --> 39:21.444
Hello?

39:26.074 --> 39:28.618
That just woke me up.

39:37.669 --> 39:40.296
I actually don't feel safe in here,
honestly.

39:44.092 --> 39:46.177
(DISTANT CLATTERING)
Holy...

39:48.471 --> 39:50.557
There's so much movement.

(GROANS)

39:57.355 --> 39:59.441
It's so fucked,

39:59.524 --> 40:02.652
that I am loosening up
to beat the shit out of someone.

40:02.736 --> 40:04.612
Cos I feel like someone's in here.

40:05.780 --> 40:07.866
Better loosen up too, bitch.

someone's in here, I think.

Coming. I'm coming.

40:23.923 --> 40:26.968
(FOOTSTEPS RUNNING)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Footsteps.

40:28.428 --> 40:30.722
Yo, Alex, get here.
(GASPS) Holy shit.

40:30.805 --> 40:33.850
OK, what the hell?
Tanner just said, "Get here."

40:33.933 --> 40:37.437
Alex, in here. Holy shit!
OK, I'm coming! I'm coming!

40:38.188 --> 40:40.273
Yo, Dak.

40:41.816 --> 40:43.902
Yo, I'm here.
OK.

40:45.445 --> 40:46.738
What happened?

40:46.821 --> 40:48.907
Tanner?
We're up here.

40:48.990 --> 40:51.534
I can't see shit! What the fuck?
It's your fault!

40:51.618 --> 40:53.244
I saw movement back there.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.330
I walked down there,
didn't see anything.

40:55.413 --> 40:57.582
All of a sudden,
I started hearing footsteps.

40:57.665 --> 41:01.336
It sounded like it was getting
closer, so I wanted you guys here.

41:01.419 --> 41:03.505
Let's go look.

41:04.673 --> 41:06.299
Hello?

41:19.104 --> 41:21.189
Are you kidding me right now?

41:21.272 --> 41:25.527
There's stairs, so the person
could have gotten away.
There's stairs.

41:26.986 --> 41:30.740
Dude, that's just an open door.
Just an open door to the outside.

41:30.824 --> 41:34.536
Easily, someone could've walked in.
Yeah, and easily gotten out.

41:34.619 --> 41:35.829
Hm.

41:35.912 --> 41:37.997
No one's in here now.

41:38.957 --> 41:42.377
But that doesn't mean someone could
have easily ran out those stairs.

41:42.460 --> 41:43.962
(EXHALES)

41:44.045 --> 41:45.505
This is weird.

41:45.588 --> 41:48.008
I honestly, like,
hope it's paranormal.

41:48.091 --> 41:51.302
That's such a messed-up thing to say
but I hope it's a ghost.

41:51.386 --> 41:54.305
I really don't think it is.
I think it was someone.

41:54.389 --> 41:56.558
Good freaking luck.
Appreciate it.

41:56.641 --> 41:58.727
Good luck, dude.
Appreciate it.

42:01.354 --> 42:03.940
Me and Alex just walked
the entire property,

42:04.024 --> 42:06.192
the whole circumference
of the hospital.

42:06.276 --> 42:08.862
We don't see anyone outside
but there's many ways

42:08.945 --> 42:10.613
to get in and out of that hospital.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.782
So just keep your walkie up.

42:13.700 --> 42:17.120
I'm gonna check in with Chelsea
just to make sure she's OK.

42:17.787 --> 42:19.873
Hey, Chelsea?
Holy sh...

42:20.915 --> 42:23.001
Yeah, what's up?
How are you doing?

42:23.835 --> 42:26.588
I am just hanging out in the morgue.

42:27.380 --> 42:29.799
Copy. Just wanted to make sure
you're OK.

42:30.342 --> 42:34.346
Tanner was dead serious
that he thought he heard someone.

42:34.429 --> 42:37.766
He had me and Alex come and do, like,
a whole sweep with him.

42:37.849 --> 42:40.393
Dang, that's so scary, actually.

42:40.477 --> 42:42.395
So freaking scary.

42:42.479 --> 42:45.565
Check in whenever you want.
I'm gonna go back to channel one.

42:45.648 --> 42:47.734
Copy that. Good luck.

42:47.817 --> 42:50.320
I really don't know
what to say about this.

42:50.403 --> 42:53.865
I'm almost frustrated that someone
tried to break in beforehand

42:53.948 --> 42:58.119
because if it is paranormal, it has
the greatest camouflage of all time.

42:58.203 --> 42:59.662
We'll never know.

42:59.746 --> 43:03.500
And it sucks that if this was some
type of spirit showing itself,

43:03.583 --> 43:05.794
that my first instinct
goes to human.

43:06.836 --> 43:08.463
That sucks.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.885
And that caution tape just fell.

43:16.763 --> 43:19.391
It's almost like
the building's listening.

43:20.392 --> 43:23.728
We are done. I'm sure you can see
the light in the hallways.

43:23.812 --> 43:25.897
Let's start wrapping up.

43:26.690 --> 43:30.860
Oh, my goodness! I've never felt
so glad to leave a building.

43:40.328 --> 43:44.541
This is by far the most scared
I have ever been

43:44.624 --> 43:46.334
on any of our road trips.

43:46.418 --> 43:51.006
Having to deal with sleeping alone
with no flashlight is my worst
nightmare.

43:51.089 --> 43:53.508
I didn't even know
I was that scared of it.

43:53.591 --> 43:59.222
The flashlight is almost like our
life force behind sleeping alone.

43:59.305 --> 44:02.559
And I really wanted to see
what would happen to each of us

44:02.642 --> 44:04.144
if I took that away.

44:04.227 --> 44:07.856
I am completely inspired by the level
of fear that I've hit now.

44:07.939 --> 44:11.693
I feel like I've found a whole new
rush I didn't even know existed.

44:12.610 --> 44:14.863
Last night was a perfect example

44:14.946 --> 44:18.074
of how there are just so
many different facets of fear.

44:18.158 --> 44:20.577
Being deprived of light,
the paranormal,

44:20.660 --> 44:23.038
also worrying about intruders.

44:23.663 --> 44:27.292
The second there was an intruder on
the property, that changed everything

44:27.375 --> 44:29.878
That brought us to
a whole new level of fear,

44:29.961 --> 44:34.215
a whole new level of vulnerability
that we've never experienced before.

44:35.133 --> 44:38.553
Even when you think you're
in control, you're really not.

44:38.636 --> 44:42.307
There's just unforeseen things
that can happen at any moment.

44:42.390 --> 44:45.101
Who knows what that person's
intentions were?

44:45.185 --> 44:48.355
They were all by themselves,
that alone is very sketchy.

44:48.438 --> 44:50.023
I will be thinking about this.

44:50.106 --> 44:52.734
Going forward, we need
to take precautions.

44:52.817 --> 44:56.738
This place definitely
still has its secrets.

44:57.655 --> 45:01.201
Every building had its own feel,
its own activity within it.

45:01.868 --> 45:03.453
It really showed last night.

45:03.536 --> 45:08.792
I mean, this place has an orphanage,
a hospital and a nursing home.

45:08.875 --> 45:12.253
Alex picked, like,
the paranormal trifecta.

45:12.337 --> 45:14.422
And Dakota's picking next.

45:14.506 --> 45:16.591
This never ends.

45:17.467 --> 45:20.970
Everyone has a cap to
how much fear they can handle.

45:21.054 --> 45:23.473
This is the biggest test
we've ever done.

45:23.556 --> 45:26.685
But as long as we stick together
and have each other's backs,

45:26.768 --> 45:28.978
we might be able
to finish this thing.
