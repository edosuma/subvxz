WEBVTT

00:04.400 --> 00:06.300
And he wouldn't stop crying.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.300
- The whole flight.
- Guess why I was sitting back.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.000
Avoid the little prep orders.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.100
Thank you so much for
kicking me out Stef.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.600
- Trent is always working late.
- Been there, hate that.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.265
I figure it's about time that

00:20.300 --> 00:23.500
I throw a little fit in case if
he's forgotten how I feel about it.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.700
Trent?

00:25.100 --> 00:28.900
Well, that sounds like he's
working really hard, doesn't it?

00:29.100 --> 00:31.400
Trent, turn it down.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.700
What are you trying
to do, wake the dead?

00:35.700 --> 00:36.800
Hey, Trent.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.100
How's it go...?

01:38.676 --> 01:40.676
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Gibbs.

01:40.711 --> 01:41.711
Did you get it?

01:41.776 --> 01:42.776
It?

01:44.376 --> 01:45.376
Abby?

01:45.976 --> 01:48.026
I put this year's tax
refund to good use.

01:48.061 --> 01:50.076
I got one for everybody on Team Gibbs.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.976
Luck be a lady tonight.

01:53.076 --> 01:57.276
Luck, if you've ever
been a lady to begin with.

01:57.376 --> 01:59.676
Luck be a...

02:00.076 --> 02:02.276
Hey, boss. Sorry about that.

02:02.311 --> 02:04.476
Sinatra, you got to sing alone.

02:04.576 --> 02:06.041
I mean, it's Old Blue Eyes.

02:06.076 --> 02:08.876
It's the Chairman of the
Board. I'm gonna Rat Pack it up.

02:13.376 --> 02:15.676
Becoming an alpha male
means that without saying

02:15.711 --> 02:18.076
a word you're able to project confidence

02:18.176 --> 02:20.776
and sexuality simply
through you body language...

02:21.376 --> 02:22.776
MIT lecture.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.476
Nothing I can't listen
to on my own time.

02:26.576 --> 02:29.076
It's the newest version,
Gibbs. It's 160 gigabytes.

02:29.111 --> 02:31.076
You could download like 40,000 songs.

02:31.176 --> 02:32.976
I only listen to five, abbs.

02:33.076 --> 02:35.241
- 5,000?
- No. Five.

02:35.276 --> 02:37.776
Oh, Gibbs. We really have
to broaden your horizons.

02:37.811 --> 02:39.576
I could download some
of my music for you.

02:39.976 --> 02:42.276
Like Android Lust or
Flesh-Eating Foundation,

02:42.311 --> 02:44.476
Green Satan, or Suicide Commando.

02:44.676 --> 02:45.841
Dead Marine.

02:45.876 --> 02:47.076
Never heard of 'em.

02:47.111 --> 02:48.276
Fort Belvoir Army Base.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.376
Let's go.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.876
Good morning, Jethro.

02:54.476 --> 02:55.476
Busy morning.

02:55.776 --> 02:56.776
Dead Marine.

02:57.976 --> 03:00.376
- Army base.
- Her rocks matches his scissors.

03:00.476 --> 03:01.876
Which puts the Colonel on top.

03:04.876 --> 03:06.776
You work for me on this one, Jethro.

03:07.576 --> 03:09.876
It's my army base and my crime scene.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.376
And my people, my office.

03:16.676 --> 03:18.576
They know we're still seeing each other?

03:21.776 --> 03:23.276
- Is she...?
- Still on top?

03:23.876 --> 03:24.976
Seeing Gibbs?

03:25.976 --> 03:27.041
Same thing.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.976
But an excellent question
nonetheless, Probie.

03:34.176 --> 03:35.776
Marine Captain Trent Reynolds.

03:36.076 --> 03:40.276
Worked for the defense Intelligence
Agency on an inter-agency task force.

03:40.676 --> 03:42.076
His wife

03:42.176 --> 03:45.476
found him last night when she got back
from a convention in Charlottesville.

03:45.511 --> 03:46.676
Where's the wife now?

03:46.976 --> 03:47.976
Mother's house.

03:48.076 --> 03:50.576
How long has he been... stuck here?

03:50.676 --> 03:53.776
Only the dead know the true
meaning of patience, Timothy.

03:53.976 --> 03:56.776
No more places to go, people to see.

03:56.876 --> 03:58.376
Except me, of course.

03:58.876 --> 04:00.076
Colonel, Jethro.

04:00.376 --> 04:01.376
So...

04:01.976 --> 04:03.676
To whom do I report?

04:03.776 --> 04:04.776
- Her.
- Me.

04:05.676 --> 04:07.076
Better get used to that.

04:08.676 --> 04:09.776
Spearguns.

04:10.176 --> 04:11.176
Pretty cool.

04:11.276 --> 04:14.476
Thunderball. Very James Bond... boss...

04:14.976 --> 04:16.576
Ma'am... Colonel.

04:17.176 --> 04:19.776
Captain Reynolds was
a recreational diver.

04:23.276 --> 04:24.276
Burglary?

04:24.376 --> 04:26.141
Well, the back door was jimmied,

04:26.176 --> 04:28.641
but the wallet and
cash were still on him,

04:28.676 --> 04:30.776
and the wife doesn't think
that anything's missing.

04:31.076 --> 04:32.841
Dr. Mallard, you got anything?

04:32.876 --> 04:36.476
You do realize I arrived
about a minute ago.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.441
The dead speak to me, Colonel,

04:38.476 --> 04:42.076
but give the poor man time to
catch his breath, so to speak.

04:42.876 --> 04:46.776
Time of death: Between
7:00 and 9:00 p.m.

04:47.076 --> 04:48.041
Yeah, Gibbs.

04:48.076 --> 04:50.276
Tony, review the witness statements.

04:50.311 --> 04:52.076
Yes, boss. Ma'am...

04:53.576 --> 04:54.641
- Colonel.
- Ziva...

04:54.676 --> 04:57.041
I will check Captain Reynolds'
phone and bank records.

04:57.076 --> 04:59.776
Agent McGee, see if you can pull
some prints off the back door.

04:59.811 --> 05:00.811
Yes, ma'am.

05:03.676 --> 05:05.176
Do you know a Major Sweigart?

05:07.176 --> 05:11.076
Major Sweigart was Captain Reynolds'
superior at Defense Intelligence.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.941
He understands the Army CID and NCIS

05:13.976 --> 05:16.776
will be working hand
in hand on this case.

05:17.676 --> 05:19.676
I mean... Side by side.

05:21.976 --> 05:22.976
Cooperatively.

05:23.076 --> 05:24.876
You've taken Captain Reynolds' laptop.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.076
- I want it back.
- That's evidence, Major.

05:27.176 --> 05:29.876
DIA deals with highly
classified materials, ma'am.

05:29.911 --> 05:31.976
And we have top secret clearance.

05:32.076 --> 05:33.876
I'm talking about
special access programs

05:33.976 --> 05:35.776
which go well beyond your clearance.

05:35.976 --> 05:36.976
Black ops?

05:37.576 --> 05:39.641
Major Sweigart, these are your options,

05:39.676 --> 05:43.076
either read in our forensic
scientist to your special access

05:43.111 --> 05:46.076
programs or send someone
who can oversee her work.

05:48.776 --> 05:51.176
- Send someone over from Cyber.
- Yes, sir.

05:51.276 --> 05:54.776
Any thoughts on who might have
wanted to kill Captain Reynolds?

05:55.376 --> 05:57.176
He got along with everyone at work.

05:57.376 --> 05:58.676
What about his personal life?

05:59.676 --> 06:02.676
Other than the usual command
dinners I didn't really know.

06:02.711 --> 06:04.676
Capitain Reynolds on a personal basis.

06:04.776 --> 06:06.376
You, Lieutenant?

06:07.276 --> 06:09.876
We played some pickup basketball
together. That's about it.

06:11.176 --> 06:13.076
I think he spent his
free time with his wife.

06:13.476 --> 06:14.476
Why?

06:15.176 --> 06:17.176
Because he was always
rushing home to be with her.

06:19.576 --> 06:21.776
Crash and burn... only a matter of time.

06:21.876 --> 06:22.676
What?

06:22.876 --> 06:23.876
Not a what...

06:24.576 --> 06:25.576
A whom.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.476
Colonel Mann, Gibbs,
Army-Navy joint operation.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.776
It could last a lifetime.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.676
Behind the torture

06:33.976 --> 06:37.376
techniques and the contract killings,
Ziva, you're really just a...

06:38.676 --> 06:39.776
A whom?

06:40.876 --> 06:42.576
What? Whom?

06:42.976 --> 06:45.476
Not a whom... It's more... it's a what.

06:45.676 --> 06:46.676
A what then?

06:46.776 --> 06:47.776
What then?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.876
What? What then? I think...

06:52.976 --> 06:54.376
I'm still just a what?

06:54.476 --> 06:55.476
A girl.

06:57.776 --> 06:58.776
Abby Sciuto.

06:59.476 --> 07:01.976
I was sent here to check
in so I could see her.

07:02.176 --> 07:03.176
Probie.

07:05.176 --> 07:06.176
Fred Rinnert,

07:06.276 --> 07:07.476
DIA.

07:08.176 --> 07:10.176
That's Defense Intelligence Agency.

07:10.776 --> 07:13.376
I was sent he to keep
track of a laptop of ours.

07:14.176 --> 07:15.576
Laptop is down in the lab.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.876
I'm here to make sure Ms.
Sciuto doesn't uncover any

07:17.911 --> 07:19.876
super-duper, secret spook stuff.

07:20.276 --> 07:22.576
Meaning, you will be
scrutinizing her every move?

07:22.611 --> 07:23.676
Exactly.

07:30.576 --> 07:33.876
I gotta warn you, Abby doesn't work well
with people looking over her shoulder.

07:34.076 --> 07:35.376
We'll do fine.

07:35.476 --> 07:36.776
I'm a people person.

07:37.676 --> 07:39.076
Make him go away, McGee.

07:39.276 --> 07:40.576
Abby, I can't.

07:42.376 --> 07:43.476
Look at him.

07:43.576 --> 07:46.276
I feel blocked. I can't
work when I'm blocked.

07:46.311 --> 07:48.676
Well, then just block him out.

07:48.776 --> 07:50.476
- What?
- You block him out.

07:51.176 --> 07:52.476
He's not there.

07:54.076 --> 07:55.176
He's not there.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.076
He's still there.

07:58.276 --> 07:59.476
Close your eyes,

08:00.176 --> 08:03.576
open them, and imagine him gone.

08:06.176 --> 08:07.876
- Didn't work.
- Try it again.

08:08.476 --> 08:09.976
He's not there.

08:10.676 --> 08:12.176
He's not there.

08:14.176 --> 08:15.676
Still not working, McGee.

08:17.076 --> 08:18.076
McGee?

08:23.176 --> 08:24.276
Try the return key.

08:24.311 --> 08:25.311
This one?

08:25.376 --> 08:26.976
- Here, let me.
- No, I got it.

08:27.076 --> 08:29.076
- No, I don't think you do.
- I got it.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.776
Sometimes it takes a soft touch, okay.

08:33.476 --> 08:34.441
There.

08:34.476 --> 08:35.876
Delete this search?

08:36.476 --> 08:37.476
No.

08:38.376 --> 08:39.376
No.

08:43.275 --> 08:46.976
Prints from Reynolds'back door scored
a match, but your computer's a little...

08:47.011 --> 08:49.576
It's linked to Abby's lab.
It's perfectly fine, Colonel.

08:53.676 --> 08:56.576
Which is more than can be
said for Major Sweigart.

08:57.876 --> 09:01.076
I dropped off some documents to
Captain Reynolds a couple of weeks ago.

09:01.276 --> 09:02.876
And you left via the back door?

09:03.676 --> 09:05.276
His wife was having friends around.

09:05.476 --> 09:07.076
I didn't want to disturb them.

09:07.276 --> 09:09.676
Mrs. Reynolds can verify
that you were at the house?

09:10.176 --> 09:11.176
Don't know.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.976
Guess you'll have to ask her, ma'am.

09:13.576 --> 09:15.776
Means you saw what was
hanging in his office.

09:16.576 --> 09:17.576
Sorry.

09:18.676 --> 09:19.876
Knew how to use it.

09:20.176 --> 09:22.776
You look pretty handy
with that speargun.

09:23.176 --> 09:24.176
Well,

09:24.876 --> 09:27.776
picture's worth a
thousand words to a jury.

09:27.811 --> 09:29.376
Yeah, or just one:

09:30.076 --> 09:31.076
Guilty.

09:31.176 --> 09:32.576
Lots of guys dive.

09:33.476 --> 09:34.576
Look, Colonel,

09:35.576 --> 09:37.376
I was with someone last night.

09:37.876 --> 09:38.876
A date.

09:39.076 --> 09:40.276
She's got a name?

09:40.311 --> 09:41.476
We went to dinner.

09:42.476 --> 09:43.476
Name.

09:43.776 --> 09:44.776
Stephanie Flynn.

09:46.676 --> 09:50.576
The woman who was with Mrs.
Reynolds when she found him dead?

09:50.876 --> 09:51.876
That's right.

09:51.976 --> 09:53.676
Stephanie Bronwyn Flynn?

09:54.776 --> 09:55.776
Yeah.

09:58.076 --> 09:59.176
You know her?

10:04.376 --> 10:05.676
I was married to her.

10:15.776 --> 10:17.676
We have a little issue.

10:18.976 --> 10:20.041
We?

10:20.076 --> 10:21.776
You, you want to tell her, Agent Gibbs?

10:21.811 --> 10:22.976
No, not particularly.

10:24.376 --> 10:27.076
Is this issue going to involve lawyers?

10:27.576 --> 10:28.576
It already did.

10:31.676 --> 10:34.476
It's his ex-wife. She's
a material witness.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.476
And which ex would that be?

10:38.576 --> 10:39.576
Stephanie.

10:39.676 --> 10:41.176
What number is she again?

10:41.476 --> 10:42.676
- Second?
- Third.

10:42.711 --> 10:43.776
Oh, right.

10:44.576 --> 10:47.176
You lived in Europe with
her for a while, Frankfurt.

10:47.276 --> 10:48.876
- Moscow.
- Two years?

10:48.911 --> 10:49.741
One.

10:49.776 --> 10:51.876
Well, it's hard to live in Moscow.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.276
With anyone.

10:53.376 --> 10:57.476
Do you think he should divorce
himself from this case, Colonel Mann?

10:57.511 --> 10:58.941
No, ma'am. No.

10:58.976 --> 11:02.176
Nor do I. I don't see a problem
if you conduct the interview.

11:02.376 --> 11:06.576
Do you have a problem with Colonel Mann
interviewing your ex-wife, Agent Gibbs?

11:06.676 --> 11:07.976
Do I have a choice?

11:08.011 --> 11:09.011
- No.
- No.

11:10.376 --> 11:11.476
Problem solved.

11:13.976 --> 11:16.676
What time did Major Sweigart
arrive at your appartment?

11:18.276 --> 11:19.976
About 6:30.

11:20.876 --> 11:21.876
And leave?

11:21.976 --> 11:22.976
About 10:00.

11:24.176 --> 11:25.176
Where's Gibbs?

11:26.876 --> 11:28.376
I know you know he's my ex.

11:29.376 --> 11:30.476
He's busy.

11:31.576 --> 11:32.976
Some things never change.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.341
Who do you think is prettier?

11:35.376 --> 11:38.341
Ex-wife number three or
future ex-wife number four?

11:38.376 --> 11:40.976
Colonel Mann is at a disadvantage
because of her uniform.

11:43.176 --> 11:46.676
Tell me you are not trying to
imagine her without her uniform, Tony.

11:49.976 --> 11:53.476
How long have you known
Agent Gibbs... Major Sweigart?

11:55.276 --> 11:56.341
Eight months.

11:56.376 --> 11:57.676
Known Gibbs longer.

11:58.876 --> 11:59.876
Wedding bells?

11:59.976 --> 12:02.476
I know how this works.
You're implying because I love

12:02.576 --> 12:04.076
Eric, I'm lying for him.

12:04.676 --> 12:05.676
Are you?

12:09.376 --> 12:11.476
He's watching, isn't he?

12:12.276 --> 12:16.076
If you're going to have me interrogated,
Jethro, at least do it yourself.

12:16.176 --> 12:17.376
Come on.

12:17.976 --> 12:19.541
You never could talk to me, could you?

12:19.576 --> 12:21.476
Well, that was then,
this is now, so just...

12:22.176 --> 12:23.576
get the hell in here!

12:23.776 --> 12:24.776
Feisty.

12:27.776 --> 12:29.376
In an attractive kind of way.

12:29.476 --> 12:31.176
Got zip at Fort Belvoir, boss.

12:31.676 --> 12:33.676
Captain Reynolds got
along with everyone.

12:33.876 --> 12:35.576
No one heard a thing last night.

12:37.276 --> 12:38.976
I'm gonna go check those phone records.

12:39.076 --> 12:40.976
I am going to help him.

12:53.576 --> 12:55.676
Interesting. So you work off and image

12:55.776 --> 12:59.176
of Captain Reynolds hard drive
instead of the actual laptop.

12:59.776 --> 13:00.876
Sorry.

13:10.376 --> 13:11.576
What are you doing?

13:11.976 --> 13:13.476
Imagining you talking to me.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.341
The laptop is evidence.
It can't be touched,

13:17.376 --> 13:20.776
so we copy the hard drive and put the
laptop back in the evidence locker.

13:23.776 --> 13:24.976
Any other questions?

13:25.176 --> 13:26.176
No.

13:26.276 --> 13:28.176
Except did you see that sniffer?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.576
- Sniffer?
- Yeah, just back up a bit.

13:32.976 --> 13:33.976
Right there.

13:34.776 --> 13:37.376
I've seen one of these.
Looks like a DLL file, right?

13:37.411 --> 13:38.676
It is a DLL file.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.276
That's what it wants you to think.

13:40.376 --> 13:42.276
It's actually an executable file.

13:42.476 --> 13:44.376
It sniffs out stuff
when you're not looking.

13:44.476 --> 13:46.576
So is this file classified?

13:47.676 --> 13:48.976
It's yours, free and clear.

13:50.776 --> 13:51.776
So...

13:51.876 --> 13:54.676
Captain Reynolds was a hacker.

13:55.676 --> 13:58.576
Does it really matter,
what I made for dinner?

14:04.376 --> 14:05.976
Chicken piccata,

14:06.276 --> 14:09.976
slightly overdone, steamed
vegetables, slightly underdone,

14:10.011 --> 14:12.876
served with a Chardonnay
that was just right.

14:14.576 --> 14:16.576
- Did he appear at all agitated?
- No.

14:17.076 --> 14:18.476
You having fun, Jethro?

14:20.476 --> 14:21.476
Still decaf?

14:22.676 --> 14:23.676
We need to talk.

14:23.776 --> 14:25.476
The colonel's conducting the interview.

14:25.876 --> 14:26.876
I'm done.

14:30.976 --> 14:32.676
Why are you targeting my boyfriend?

14:33.076 --> 14:34.341
You couldn't make me happy, so

14:34.376 --> 14:36.676
you won't let me be happy
with someone else, is that it?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.076
- No.
- Then what are you doing?

14:39.176 --> 14:41.576
What I've always had to
do, Stephanie, my job.

14:41.676 --> 14:43.426
Can we at least finish one conversation?

14:43.461 --> 14:45.141
I'm starting to feel like I'm married.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.376
That's funny. I never felt
like we were ever married.

14:47.676 --> 14:50.476
Look, Eric didn't do this
and I don't know what evidence

14:50.576 --> 14:53.076
you've got that makes you
think he did, but you're wrong.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.676
Just don't screw this up for me, Jethro.

14:55.776 --> 14:56.876
It's not about you.

14:57.676 --> 14:59.276
Well, it was never about me, was it?

15:01.776 --> 15:02.776
Boss?

15:04.876 --> 15:06.376
Abby needs to see us.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.276
I'm just going to...

15:13.276 --> 15:14.976
I'm happy you found somebody.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.676
I'll send an agent
down to escort you out.

15:24.476 --> 15:25.476
Cyber guy here yet?

15:26.076 --> 15:27.176
Yeah, in with Abby.

15:28.576 --> 15:29.576
She'll be fine.

15:30.376 --> 15:31.376
Get out!

15:31.476 --> 15:32.476
I'm serious.

15:32.576 --> 15:35.276
So... the dead are strung
up on a spit and roasted?

15:35.311 --> 15:37.976
Yeah, and then the tribe
serves up the drippings.

15:38.011 --> 15:39.041
So gross.

15:39.076 --> 15:40.776
- And you saw this?
- Saw what, Abs?

15:40.876 --> 15:43.376
A death ritual that would
make your hair stand up on end.

15:43.411 --> 15:45.876
Maybe not your hair but
definitely, say, McGee's hair.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.476
What about our ritual? Solving crimes.

15:48.676 --> 15:50.176
Fred found a sniffer.

15:51.476 --> 15:54.676
It's a keystroke logger used
by hackers to find passwords.

15:54.776 --> 15:56.176
And you're never going to guess

15:56.276 --> 15:58.876
whose computer Captain
Reynolds was hacking into.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.976
Well, just 'cause I said you'd never
guess doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

16:03.076 --> 16:04.576
Major Eric Sweigart.

16:04.776 --> 16:05.776
Him again.

16:05.876 --> 16:07.276
What was Reynolds accessing?

16:07.376 --> 16:11.176
Sweigart's e - mails, which I still
have to manually cut and paste.

16:11.276 --> 16:13.276
- Do it, Abs.
- Well, I found something else.

16:13.376 --> 16:14.876
Captain Reynolds opened a

16:14.976 --> 16:17.741
file-share application
at 7:30 last night.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.876
- What's a file-share...
- File-share application.

16:19.976 --> 16:22.041
You share music, videos,

16:22.076 --> 16:25.176
other files, put 'em on the Internet,
anyone who wants to can copy 'em.

16:25.211 --> 16:26.776
7:30 is about the time of death.

16:26.876 --> 16:29.176
But what's weird is... The song.

16:29.376 --> 16:30.576
Drumroll, please.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.176
"The Elements" song.

16:37.776 --> 16:39.176
A song about the weather?

16:39.276 --> 16:41.076
No, no, no, it recites all the elements.

16:41.176 --> 16:43.941
It's a comic ditty written by a Harvard

16:43.976 --> 16:47.176
math professor in the late
50s. It's really catchy...

16:49.976 --> 16:52.076
Well, Abby, maybe if
you play it, you'll...

16:54.076 --> 16:56.076
There's antimony, arsenic,
aluminum, seleniuma,

16:56.176 --> 16:58.126
and hydrogen and oxygen
and nitrogen and rhenium,

16:58.161 --> 17:00.076
and nickel, neodymium,
neptunium, germanium,

17:00.176 --> 17:02.176
and iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium,

17:02.276 --> 17:04.276
europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium.

17:04.376 --> 17:06.675
And lanthanum and osmium
and astatine and radium.

17:06.711 --> 17:08.976
And gold and protactinium,
and indium and gallium.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.340
He has access to the nation's secrets

17:12.376 --> 17:15.175
and he's file-sharing that
song just before he dies?

17:15.576 --> 17:16.476
Why?

17:16.576 --> 17:17.776
Abby's going to find out.

17:17.876 --> 17:20.476
Yes, because neither
rain nor sleet nor any

17:20.576 --> 17:24.175
class of simple atomic substance will
keep me from my appointed duty, sir.

17:24.776 --> 17:25.776
Sweet.

17:30.476 --> 17:33.176
You know, when I was in the
sixthrade I made a complete

17:33.276 --> 17:36.576
periodic table out of
licorice and Junior Mints.

17:38.076 --> 17:38.876
Cool.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.876
Yeah, that's... impressive, McGee.

17:42.376 --> 17:44.776
That must have been extremely awkward...

17:46.476 --> 17:48.176
For all concerned.

17:48.576 --> 17:50.176
So what happened between them?

17:50.276 --> 17:54.176
You know, a man's heart
often tells us how he lived.

17:54.276 --> 17:55.476
Sometimes...

17:55.676 --> 17:59.676
it might even tell us how he
died, but contrary to popular myth,

18:00.476 --> 18:02.576
it never tells us how he loved.

18:02.876 --> 18:03.841
I'm sorry.

18:03.876 --> 18:05.776
I did not mean to put you on the spot.

18:05.976 --> 18:08.276
You won't find a better man than Jethro.

18:09.076 --> 18:10.476
He's a fircely loyal

18:10.676 --> 18:14.376
colleague and friend, but he
does come with his challenges.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.776
Tell me about it.

18:16.676 --> 18:19.576
There's a part of him I...

18:19.976 --> 18:22.676
I don't know, I mean,
he just shuts me out.

18:23.176 --> 18:25.576
I thought maybe it was
Stephanie or their marriage...

18:25.611 --> 18:27.176
They weren't married long.

18:27.376 --> 18:28.676
Fourteen months.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.476
Top of my class in Interrogation.

18:32.576 --> 18:35.376
Remind me to ask for a
highly qualified lawyer

18:35.411 --> 18:37.376
should I ever be interrogated by you.

18:37.676 --> 18:40.676
I don't want to be another
one of his mistakes, Ducky.

18:41.476 --> 18:43.676
I know he's been married three time.

18:48.376 --> 18:49.776
More than three time?

18:50.376 --> 18:52.676
Perhaps I should get that lawyer now.

18:54.776 --> 18:57.576
Divorced three times, married four.

18:59.476 --> 19:00.676
Jethro's married?

19:01.076 --> 19:02.276
Heavens no.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.176
Well, then, I don't...

19:10.076 --> 19:13.076
His first wife, along
with his only child.

19:13.376 --> 19:15.276
Oh, my God...

19:16.776 --> 19:19.876
He named the boat "Kelly".

19:20.276 --> 19:21.476
After his daughter.

19:22.176 --> 19:23.976
She was eight-years-old.

19:26.276 --> 19:27.376
What happened?

19:28.076 --> 19:30.476
I think you should ask Jethro that.

19:33.976 --> 19:37.576
His wife witnessed a murder.
She identified the shooter.

19:37.611 --> 19:38.776
He came after her.

19:40.576 --> 19:41.776
What was her name?

19:42.276 --> 19:43.376
Shannon.

19:46.276 --> 19:47.776
Results, Duck?

19:48.476 --> 19:50.641
Captain Reynolds' cause of death

19:50.676 --> 19:54.626
was relatively straight forward,
but I did find something else.

19:54.661 --> 19:58.576
On his cheeks, we found a
residue of prolactin and lysozyme.

19:59.076 --> 20:00.176
Tears, Jethro.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.776
Captain Reynolds was
crying when he died.

20:04.476 --> 20:06.876
Checked Reynold's phone records, boss.

20:07.776 --> 20:09.676
Colonel, ma'am...

20:10.876 --> 20:11.976
I drew a blank.

20:12.376 --> 20:15.676
So we checked Major
Sweigart'phone records.

20:16.776 --> 20:19.576
Ten calls in the last three
days to the same person...

20:20.276 --> 20:21.276
A woman.

20:21.876 --> 20:23.376
- Stephanie?
- No.

20:24.676 --> 20:26.476
Jill, Captain Reynolds' wife.

20:35.387 --> 20:37.787
The husband, the wife and the lover.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.587
All the trademarks of
a classic love triangle.

20:41.187 --> 20:42.887
You forgot the lover's lover,

20:42.987 --> 20:46.087
which would make it technically,
I think, a lovers quadrangle.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.487
Or it could be a ring.

20:48.387 --> 20:51.787
Abby uncovered suspicious
activity on the victim's laptop.

20:51.887 --> 20:55.287
And since Captain Reynolds had access
to highly classified defense secrets,

20:55.387 --> 20:57.187
we cannot rule out a spy ring.

20:57.487 --> 21:00.087
And we know that Major
Sweigart was with your ex...

21:00.987 --> 21:02.687
with... Stephanie Flynn.

21:02.722 --> 21:04.387
And Mrs. Reynolds was at

21:04.487 --> 21:06.487
a pharmaceutical convention
in Charlottesville.

21:06.787 --> 21:10.287
- Charlottesville.
- Yes, Charlottesville.

21:10.322 --> 21:12.587
Great minds think alike, McGee.

21:13.887 --> 21:16.787
Fort Belvoir, where
Reynolds died, is here.

21:17.087 --> 21:19.787
Charlottesville is here, 104 miles.

21:19.887 --> 21:20.887
Two hour drive.

21:21.387 --> 21:24.687
Close enough for Jill Reynolds
to drive home, kill her husband,

21:24.787 --> 21:26.887
drive back to Charlottesville, and fly

21:26.987 --> 21:29.487
home again to discover him
dead with a witness present.

21:29.587 --> 21:32.587
- That does not mean she did it.
- It doesn't mean she didn't do it.

21:32.687 --> 21:34.187
- Motive?
- DiNozzo, check...

21:34.287 --> 21:36.352
Life insurance. Did it, 400 grand

21:36.387 --> 21:39.687
from the military, another quarter mil
from a private carrier, a beneficiary:

21:39.887 --> 21:40.852
Jill Reynolds.

21:40.887 --> 21:43.687
The crime scene just became
our prime suspect's house.

21:43.722 --> 21:45.887
- Get a warrant.
- Mrs. Reynolds?

21:47.287 --> 21:48.387
We'll bring her in.

21:51.587 --> 21:53.837
There's sulfur, californium,
and fermium, berkelium,

21:53.872 --> 21:56.087
and also mendelevium,
einsteinium, noelium and argon,

21:56.187 --> 21:58.887
krypton, neon, radon, xenon,
zinc and rhodium. And chlorine,

21:58.922 --> 22:01.287
carbon, cobalt, copper,
tungsten, tin and sodium...

22:03.187 --> 22:04.787
You thinking what I'm thinking?

22:05.487 --> 22:06.587
I hope so.

22:06.787 --> 22:07.787
Steganography.

22:08.287 --> 22:09.487
Not even close.

22:09.587 --> 22:11.687
If the song has a meaning,
then the meaning is

22:11.722 --> 22:13.687
probably hidden inside a file.

22:13.987 --> 22:17.187
What's the most sophisticated
way to hide a file in a computer?

22:17.287 --> 22:19.587
- Steganography.
- Now you're thinking what I'm thinking.

22:19.687 --> 22:21.152
Yeah, but I was enjoying thinking

22:21.187 --> 22:23.687
what I was thinking before you
asked me what I was thinking.

22:23.787 --> 22:26.287
Would I have enjoyed
what you were thinking?

22:27.187 --> 22:28.287
Don't answer that.

22:28.887 --> 22:30.387
I developed a program

22:30.487 --> 22:33.587
to search for any
steganography algorithm.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.387
If there is a stego file
on there, this puppy...

22:36.487 --> 22:37.687
will find it.

22:38.187 --> 22:39.187
You're good.

22:39.487 --> 22:40.487
Please.

22:41.287 --> 22:43.987
Hey! You ever feel like you could
use some extra help around here?

22:44.087 --> 22:45.987
I work like 16 hours a day.

22:46.187 --> 22:49.587
That's like two eight-hour
days stuck together.

22:49.987 --> 22:50.987
Yup.

22:51.587 --> 22:54.287
It's probably not in the budget, and...

22:55.587 --> 22:57.187
I'm kind of a control freak.

22:57.287 --> 23:00.687
I work for two control freaks,
neither of whom are as smart as you.

23:01.387 --> 23:02.687
I'm not that smart.

23:02.787 --> 23:04.887
- Please.
- I'm not.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.587
I'm not.

23:09.587 --> 23:10.587
Password cracker?

23:11.687 --> 23:13.387
Password cracker.

23:29.587 --> 23:31.587
- You're going to tell me?
- Tell you what?

23:31.687 --> 23:32.987
What's bugging you.

23:36.987 --> 23:38.687
How long have we been together?

23:48.887 --> 23:50.787
- Weeks.
- Months.

23:50.822 --> 23:52.687
Meaning many weeks.

23:54.387 --> 23:55.787
We've shared a lot, right?

23:55.887 --> 23:56.887
Yeah.

23:58.787 --> 24:00.387
Divorced three times.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.687
- I told you that.
- Married four.

24:03.787 --> 24:05.887
You never told me about
your first wife, Shannon.

24:06.087 --> 24:07.687
Or that you had a daughter, Kelly.

24:08.587 --> 24:09.587
Why, Jethro?

24:12.387 --> 24:13.387
They're dead.

24:14.687 --> 24:15.687
End of story.

24:17.887 --> 24:19.287
I've put it behind me.

24:22.687 --> 24:23.687
Have you?

24:36.987 --> 24:38.987
Anything from those
ATMs in Charlottesville?

24:39.287 --> 24:40.387
Not yet, boss.

24:42.987 --> 24:44.187
I was thinking, boss.

24:44.587 --> 24:46.052
Now, you know that Abby and I have

24:46.087 --> 24:49.387
solved a lot of computer problems
together, and it seems to me that,

24:49.687 --> 24:51.887
you know, three heads
are better than two.

24:52.187 --> 24:55.987
And seeing as how the period table
is, you know, in my wheelhouse...

24:57.187 --> 24:58.187
it seems...

25:03.387 --> 25:06.287
I was thinking it'd probably be best
if I stay here, focus on my job...

25:06.487 --> 25:08.687
- That's a good call.
- Abby focus on hers.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.187
I tell you, Colonel,

25:12.587 --> 25:14.987
guys like Fred... they're
a dime a dozen at MIT.

25:15.587 --> 25:18.387
Charming, funny,
successful, good-looking.

25:18.587 --> 25:20.087
Women see right through that.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.587
Exactly.

25:26.487 --> 25:27.487
Excuse us there.

25:27.587 --> 25:29.987
- NCIS.
- We are looking for Jill Reynolds.

25:30.387 --> 25:31.487
She's in the back.

25:31.687 --> 25:32.687
You a friend?

25:33.587 --> 25:34.887
Lieutenant Marsden.

25:34.987 --> 25:37.887
Command sent me out to go over Captain
Reynolds'death benefits with her.

25:38.587 --> 25:39.687
Quite the waterfall.

25:40.987 --> 25:42.187
She means windfall.

25:43.987 --> 25:46.487
If you think money compensates
for the loss of a loved one.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.087
No, I'm sure it doesn't.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.287
Excuse me.

25:58.087 --> 25:59.687
NCIS. Mrs. Reynolds?

25:59.987 --> 26:00.987
In here.

26:11.587 --> 26:13.687
Cleaning is kind of therapeutic for me.

26:18.387 --> 26:19.887
Give it to me, baby, come on.

26:20.587 --> 26:21.787
Don't make me beg.

26:26.687 --> 26:27.687
Hey, McGee.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.587
Everything okay?

26:30.187 --> 26:31.887
I'm just running a password cracker.

26:32.787 --> 26:34.087
I brought you a...

26:36.987 --> 26:37.952
Caf-Pow!

26:37.987 --> 26:39.987
This is a monumental task, McGee.

26:40.487 --> 26:43.387
The keyboard doesn't just have
numbers, it has the whole alphabet.

26:43.422 --> 26:44.552
Could be case-sensitive.

26:44.587 --> 26:47.687
Or you could take 1000 years to go
through all the possible permutations.

26:47.887 --> 26:49.787
You know, the more
complicated the password,

26:49.822 --> 26:51.687
the bigger the need to
keep some record of it.

26:52.487 --> 26:53.452
Nice try, McGee,

26:53.487 --> 26:55.887
but we already looked for it
in the copy of his hard drive.

26:57.187 --> 26:58.987
But not in the actual laptop.

26:59.287 --> 27:01.987
It could be hidden in a
secret partition of RAM.

27:02.187 --> 27:03.287
That's brilliant!

27:03.887 --> 27:06.187
I'm gonna go get the laptop
out of the evidence locker.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.887
These have quite a kick, don't they?

27:21.387 --> 27:23.787
I down six or seven of
these bad boys a day.

27:25.287 --> 27:26.987
There's a serious conflict here.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.487
Jethro shouldn't be
leading this investigation.

27:29.587 --> 27:31.587
He's not. Colonel Mann is.

27:33.687 --> 27:35.487
You pick up that look from Gibbs?

27:37.987 --> 27:40.087
I picked up a lot of
bad habits from Gibbs.

27:40.687 --> 27:42.187
I understand your concern.

27:42.487 --> 27:43.987
Then take him off the case.

27:44.387 --> 27:46.287
I've known Agent Gibbs a long time.

27:46.487 --> 27:48.287
I trust and respect his judgment.

27:49.187 --> 27:51.287
My boy friend didn't kill anyone.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.887
Then I'm sure the investigation
will bear that out.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.187
Maybe not before damaging
Eric's military career.

27:56.487 --> 27:58.452
If Major Sweigart wasn't involved,

27:58.487 --> 28:02.187
I'll personally see to it that he
suffers no career repercussions.

28:03.287 --> 28:04.287
Thank you.

28:05.787 --> 28:07.387
Can I ask you a personal question?

28:10.387 --> 28:13.787
I don't quite know how to put this,
but I always had the feeling that before

28:14.587 --> 28:16.987
our marriage, there was
something between you and Jethro.

28:18.987 --> 28:21.687
It has always been strictly
professional between us.

28:23.087 --> 28:24.387
She's got something to hide.

28:24.587 --> 28:26.387
Why else would she clean so thoroughly?

28:31.087 --> 28:32.087
Train wreck.

28:34.587 --> 28:36.287
I want to look away, but I can't.

28:36.587 --> 28:37.787
Agent Gibbs?

28:40.187 --> 28:41.487
- Director.
- Colonel,

28:41.987 --> 28:44.387
I was just reassuring Gibbs's...

28:46.087 --> 28:47.387
your witness,

28:47.487 --> 28:49.287
that Agent Gibbs could separate himself

28:49.387 --> 28:51.787
from the personal aspects
of this investigation.

28:52.287 --> 28:55.487
Well, I'll monitor
him, closely, Director.

28:56.487 --> 28:57.687
I'm sure you will.

28:59.687 --> 29:02.287
- Is that the look you're talking about?
- Yeah, that's it.

29:03.187 --> 29:04.887
Yup, we've all seen that one.

29:08.187 --> 29:11.087
Miss Flynn was just leaving,
unless you need her for something.

29:11.187 --> 29:12.287
No. She can go home.

29:13.587 --> 29:14.587
For now.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.152
You find anything?

29:17.187 --> 29:18.987
I bet you've never
been happier to see me.

29:19.387 --> 29:20.652
- It was clean.
- Spotless.

29:20.687 --> 29:22.698
She's like that professional
cleaner in Pulp Fiction.

29:22.722 --> 29:24.787
We found a partial print in the kitchen

29:24.822 --> 29:26.087
- near the office.
- Run it.

29:26.287 --> 29:28.587
I mean, with only, like, a
squiggle on a little loop.

29:28.687 --> 29:31.987
- We don't even know which finger.
- Only ten possibilities, DiNozzo.

29:32.087 --> 29:34.487
Well, no. There's one
point, there's ten fingers.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.187
You know, that's thousands of...

29:36.787 --> 29:37.787
On it.

29:40.587 --> 29:41.587
Train wreck.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.487
Why have you kept me waiting?

29:50.687 --> 29:52.587
- Give you time to think.
- I don't...

29:53.187 --> 29:54.887
want to think. I want to clean.

29:56.687 --> 29:59.187
We know about your affair
with Major Sweigart.

30:00.087 --> 30:01.287
Your husband knew, too.

30:04.487 --> 30:05.487
He didn't.

30:06.187 --> 30:08.787
He hacked into Major
Sweigart's e-mails.

30:09.187 --> 30:11.287
Read everything you
ever wrote to each other.

30:11.887 --> 30:13.287
He was crying when he died.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.687
We also know about the life insurance.

30:17.287 --> 30:20.487
650,000 reasons not to want a divorce.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.687
I don't care about the money.

30:25.887 --> 30:27.587
Wait. You think that...

30:28.187 --> 30:31.887
Look, my marriage wasn't good,
but I would never, ever...

30:32.687 --> 30:33.787
I told you,

30:33.987 --> 30:36.037
I was at a conference
in Charlottesville.

30:36.072 --> 30:38.087
- All you have to do is check.
- We did.

30:38.787 --> 30:40.687
- I signed in.
- And you slipped out.

30:41.987 --> 30:44.687
- Killed your husband, drove back.
- No!

30:44.887 --> 30:47.887
You want to clean? You clean your
conscience, you tell the truth.

30:47.922 --> 30:49.687
- I am!
- You're not!

30:52.987 --> 30:55.187
- What?
- Boss, I got something you need to see.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.487
We'll be right there.

31:01.087 --> 31:03.087
I've been watching the
footage of ATMs surrounding

31:03.187 --> 31:04.452
the pharmaceutical convention

31:04.487 --> 31:06.687
in Charlottesville on the
day Captain Reynolds died.

31:07.187 --> 31:08.887
As you can see, it's time-stamped.

31:09.787 --> 31:10.987
Check out the brunette.

31:11.187 --> 31:12.987
No. In the background
rounding the corner.

31:15.587 --> 31:16.587
Wait for it.

31:17.987 --> 31:18.987
There!

31:19.687 --> 31:21.587
Jill Reynolds. 8:05.

31:21.787 --> 31:23.487
Can't be two places at once.

31:23.787 --> 31:24.787
She's clean...

31:25.987 --> 31:27.187
in more ways than one.

31:39.187 --> 31:40.887
Maybe she hired a contract killer.

31:40.987 --> 31:43.187
What about the partial
prints in Reynold's kitchen?

31:43.387 --> 31:45.887
Came up with 80,000 potential hits.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.187
I know. Trying to
narrow it down to people

31:48.287 --> 31:49.987
who might have had
access to the Army base.

31:50.087 --> 31:51.587
Have we given up on Major Sweigart?

31:51.687 --> 31:52.787
He has an alibi.

31:52.887 --> 31:55.087
From someone who thinks
he's her future husband.

31:55.487 --> 31:57.787
- Stephanie wouldn't lie.
- Are you sure?

32:00.187 --> 32:01.852
Well, I'm not. I mean, she finds out

32:01.887 --> 32:04.387
that her boyfriend was having
an affair with her best friend,

32:04.787 --> 32:06.187
she might just change her story.

32:06.787 --> 32:08.487
Bring her in for another interview.

32:10.587 --> 32:11.587
Wait.

32:11.987 --> 32:13.987
- I said bring her in.
- I'd said wait.

32:20.687 --> 32:22.387
This never turns out well for the kids.

32:23.487 --> 32:24.852
Can you be objective here?

32:24.887 --> 32:26.687
Because if you can't,
you're no good to me.

32:30.187 --> 32:33.287
If this wasn't your ex, what
would your gut be saying right now?

32:34.487 --> 32:36.487
It would be saying bring
her in and break her.

32:39.287 --> 32:40.287
Maybe

32:40.587 --> 32:42.287
she's lying to protect her boyfriend.

32:43.287 --> 32:44.387
Maybe it's worse.

32:46.187 --> 32:48.187
What if Stephanie knew about the affair?

32:51.887 --> 32:52.887
She'd walk.

32:54.187 --> 32:55.987
Okay, then, let's talk about motive.

32:56.387 --> 32:58.352
Maybe she wants to frame
Jill for being the bitch

32:58.387 --> 33:01.387
who stole her boyfriend. Or maybe
Major Sweigart for cheating on her.

33:02.587 --> 33:03.887
You don't know Stephanie.

33:04.887 --> 33:06.287
But I do know my job.

33:10.187 --> 33:11.787
- DiNozzo.
- Here I am, boss.

33:11.887 --> 33:12.887
Call her.

33:13.187 --> 33:15.287
Tell her to come in. I
need to talk with her.

33:23.887 --> 33:24.887
Voicemail.

33:30.687 --> 33:31.687
Same thing.

33:36.687 --> 33:40.187
This is Special Agent Anthony
DiNozzo of NCIS for Stephanie Flynn.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.287
As of when?

33:45.787 --> 33:46.787
Thank you.

33:50.687 --> 33:52.887
Stephanie quit her job this morning.

33:59.387 --> 34:00.987
- Pow!
- Another one?

34:01.287 --> 34:04.387
I found a program on Captain
Reynolds' boot-up sequence.

34:04.487 --> 34:05.587
Guess what it does.

34:05.687 --> 34:07.363
Judging by your
expression, something good.

34:07.387 --> 34:10.286
It creates the password when
you turn the computer on,

34:10.322 --> 34:11.987
and it deletes it when you turn it off.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.487
Hidden in RAM. You know what?

34:14.687 --> 34:18.286
If I weren't so irrationally confident,
I might actually be intimidated by you.

34:19.187 --> 34:22.087
Please. Okay, so it's 30 characters.

34:22.187 --> 34:23.987
That's too many for a password cracker.

34:24.587 --> 34:26.687
Here we go.

34:29.687 --> 34:32.087
That was really anticlimactic.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.587
Okay, so...

34:33.687 --> 34:37.286
the file extension indicates
it's an audio plug-in file.

34:38.487 --> 34:40.286
Last accessed...

34:40.887 --> 34:43.087
at 7:31 p. M. On Monday.

34:43.187 --> 34:46.187
That's the same time Captain
Reynolds uploaded the song.

34:46.687 --> 34:49.887
That's the same time he died,
it give or take a chorus.

34:50.087 --> 34:51.987
Let's see what the
plug-in does with the song.

34:54.987 --> 34:56.087
Selenium...

34:56.487 --> 34:58.287
Uranium... Gallium...

34:58.387 --> 34:59.387
Phosphorus.

34:59.787 --> 35:01.187
Potassium... Polonium...

35:01.587 --> 35:02.587
Curium...

35:02.987 --> 35:04.087
Sodium.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.987
The plug-in is just a filter...
it highlights pieces of the song.

35:11.387 --> 35:13.387
- It's a code.
- It's not a code.

35:13.687 --> 35:14.787
It's just words, Abby.

35:15.887 --> 35:18.187
It's not just words, Fred. It's numbers.

35:18.587 --> 35:21.287
Every element has a corresponding
number on the periodic table.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.487
Selenium is 34,

35:23.587 --> 35:25.987
uranium 92,

35:26.187 --> 35:27.887
and gallium 31.

35:29.687 --> 35:30.787
Abby's office.

35:31.487 --> 35:32.887
Yeah. She's right here.

35:33.187 --> 35:35.487
I could... Okay. No. I'll tell her, sir.

35:36.387 --> 35:37.687
Your boss wants to see you.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.687
Gibbs... has this uncanny ability

35:41.787 --> 35:43.287
to know when I found something.

35:44.487 --> 35:46.687
I don't even know what I found yet.

35:46.987 --> 35:48.387
Well, he didn't seem happy.

35:49.687 --> 35:51.787
He never does, even when he is happy.

35:51.887 --> 35:53.587
And I doubt he's happy right now.

35:53.787 --> 35:55.587
But, you know, I am his favorite,

35:55.687 --> 35:57.687
so he's usually pretty good with me.

35:57.787 --> 35:59.187
Even when you keep him waiting?

36:02.787 --> 36:03.887
I'll be right back.

36:05.787 --> 36:06.787
Hurry up.

36:07.587 --> 36:08.587
Try her again.

36:09.387 --> 36:10.437
I'm here, Gibbs.

36:10.472 --> 36:11.487
- Abby.
- Wait.

36:12.387 --> 36:15.987
"Selenium, uranium, gallium, phosphorus.
Potassium, polonium, curium and sodium."

36:16.022 --> 36:17.187
It's the song, Gibbs!

36:17.387 --> 36:19.487
There was a program on
Captain Reynolds' laptop

36:19.587 --> 36:20.987
that highlighted these elements.

36:21.087 --> 36:23.487
The periodic table has a
number associated with each one.

36:23.522 --> 36:24.652
The numbers mean something,

36:24.687 --> 36:27.287
I just don't know what yet.
Like 34 could be three-four...

36:27.322 --> 36:28.552
92 could be nine-two.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.852
- Could be a GPS coordinate.
- Or a bank account.

36:30.887 --> 36:33.187
I just need to know how you
knew that I found something.

36:33.987 --> 36:35.087
I didn't, Abby.

36:35.387 --> 36:36.987
Stephanie's still not answering.

36:37.887 --> 36:39.487
Well, why did you call me?

36:40.387 --> 36:42.287
- I didn't.
- Fred said you did.

36:42.487 --> 36:44.887
Boss, guess who was one the 88,000 hits

36:44.987 --> 36:46.587
from the crime scene fingerprints.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.287
- Fred?
- You guessed.

36:48.387 --> 36:49.387
Where is he?

36:49.787 --> 36:51.287
- In my lab.
- With evidence?

36:51.587 --> 36:52.587
With the laptop!

36:53.187 --> 36:54.887
Find out what this means, McGee.

36:56.287 --> 36:57.487
Hey, going somewhere?

36:58.087 --> 36:59.087
Home.

36:59.287 --> 37:01.087
- Tell me you didn't.
- Didn't what?

37:03.687 --> 37:05.287
You know, I think we had a power surge.

37:08.687 --> 37:09.887
They're wiped clean.

37:10.887 --> 37:12.087
The original laptop?

37:16.687 --> 37:18.287
I did not leave this open!

37:18.887 --> 37:20.187
You wiped it, too!

37:20.587 --> 37:22.787
Abby, I'm hurt! You think I did this?

37:23.487 --> 37:25.487
- Gibbs, can I hit him?
- No.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.187
Look, anybody could have done it.

37:28.787 --> 37:30.787
The lab was left
unattended, right, Abby?

37:32.287 --> 37:35.387
Unless you're gonna arrest me, I've
got a date with my Pilates instructor.

37:40.887 --> 37:42.187
Hey, what are you doing?

37:42.487 --> 37:44.152
Last number dialed, my lab.

37:44.187 --> 37:45.587
Yeah, so, could've missed that one.

37:45.622 --> 37:46.687
The last e-mail.

37:47.387 --> 37:49.387
Confirmed for a flight on Thai Air.

37:50.787 --> 37:52.987
- Why did you erase the hard drives?
- I didn't.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.387
What do the numbers mean?

37:54.787 --> 37:55.787
Not a clue.

37:56.987 --> 38:00.387
DIA deals with classified
material. You found a foreign buyer?

38:01.987 --> 38:04.087
You have to go up, in
order to go down, right?

38:05.387 --> 38:06.787
Can I hit him now, Gibbs?

38:07.687 --> 38:10.087
You think Reynolds could have
set up that computer code?

38:10.487 --> 38:12.087
Only an expert could have done it.

38:12.387 --> 38:15.187
Reynolds had access to the
secrets, you knew how to steal them.

38:15.387 --> 38:17.487
Are we gonna find some
money stashed away?

38:18.387 --> 38:20.087
If you've got the evidence, arrest me.

38:20.122 --> 38:21.887
If not... have a nice day.

38:26.487 --> 38:29.187
Lieutenant Marsden just confirmed
that our friend here volunteered

38:29.222 --> 38:30.887
to oversee Abby's work on the laptop.

38:30.987 --> 38:33.337
Why didn't you wipe the hard
drive after you killed him?

38:33.372 --> 38:35.687
He didn't think anyone was
smart enough to find the code,

38:35.722 --> 38:37.663
- until it was sent to me.
- I didn't kill anyone.

38:37.687 --> 38:41.087
Either Reynolds wouldn't split the
money with you or you got greedy.

38:41.187 --> 38:44.087
Think of the slimiest thing
and that's what he did!

38:44.187 --> 38:45.187
Come on, McGee.

38:47.987 --> 38:49.987
- Hey, I know my rights.
- Boss, I got it.

38:50.687 --> 38:53.787
Numbers are an offshore account in
the names of both Captain Reynolds

38:53.822 --> 38:54.752
and Fred Rinnert.

38:54.787 --> 38:57.687
One half-million dollars
transferred into the account

38:57.787 --> 39:01.287
from a bank in Beirut at
7:30 the night Reynolds died.

39:01.487 --> 39:03.187
It was cleaned out two hours later.

39:03.387 --> 39:04.787
So, it was greed?

39:08.787 --> 39:10.787
My acting boss says you
ain't going anywhere.

39:11.387 --> 39:13.287
What'd you sell and
who'd you sell it to?

39:15.287 --> 39:16.987
Maybe if you cut me a deal,

39:17.287 --> 39:18.287
I'll tell you.

39:27.987 --> 39:28.987
Sweet.

39:34.787 --> 39:37.887
Why isn't that a romantic night
on the town always turns into

39:37.922 --> 39:40.587
a less than romantic night
in your basement, sanding...

39:41.987 --> 39:43.087
your boat.

39:45.587 --> 39:46.587
Hello, Stephanie.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.087
Still not locking your
front door, Jethro.

39:55.187 --> 39:56.187
Sweet.

39:59.787 --> 40:01.387
I just came by to...

40:02.587 --> 40:03.687
give you these.

40:04.187 --> 40:05.587
I found them in a drawer...

40:06.887 --> 40:08.087
about six years ago.

40:09.487 --> 40:10.687
I thought I'd lost them.

40:11.287 --> 40:12.287
I'm gonna...

40:12.587 --> 40:15.087
- wait for you upstairs.
- No... it's okay. I'm...

40:16.387 --> 40:18.687
- I'm not staying. So...
- I'll walk you out.

40:26.387 --> 40:27.387
Good luck.

40:29.087 --> 40:30.087
Thanks.

40:40.287 --> 40:41.487
Why'd you quit your job?

40:45.687 --> 40:47.487
I'm moving to Philadelphia.

40:48.787 --> 40:50.287
My parents are getting old.

40:50.322 --> 40:51.787
And, Shelley had a baby.

40:51.987 --> 40:54.087
- Another one?
- She's a baby factory.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.687
It's a good thing
someone in my family is.

40:59.087 --> 41:00.687
I guess I'm gonna be that...

41:01.387 --> 41:04.087
doting aunt that still
looks great in her bikini.

41:11.787 --> 41:12.887
Eric and I split up.

41:14.787 --> 41:16.087
He told me about his...

41:16.687 --> 41:19.187
affair... with Jill.

41:20.787 --> 41:21.787
You knew.

41:25.487 --> 41:27.252
After all my ranting in your office,

41:27.287 --> 41:30.487
you missed a perfect opportunity
to throw that in my face.

41:31.287 --> 41:32.587
I wouldn't do that to you.

41:34.587 --> 41:35.787
No, you wouldn't.

41:38.887 --> 41:41.287
It just never seems to
work out for me, Jethro.

41:44.287 --> 41:45.487
I'm sorry.

41:47.787 --> 41:49.887
Me. Us. Not your fault.

41:54.187 --> 41:55.687
Wasn't anybody's fault.

42:04.987 --> 42:06.387
We'll always have Moscow.

42:21.187 --> 42:23.587
You never cease to surprise me.

42:24.087 --> 42:25.187
Music.

42:46.787 --> 42:47.987
What do you think, daddy?!

42:48.187 --> 42:49.687
I came in second place!

42:49.787 --> 42:51.487
You would have been
proud of her, Jethro.

42:51.587 --> 42:52.587
I miss you, daddy!

42:52.687 --> 42:56.187
When you get home, I'll be
really good at it, I promise.

42:56.387 --> 42:57.352
I love you.

42:57.387 --> 42:58.587
A kiss for daddy.

43:00.787 --> 43:02.687
I love you, daddy... love you.

43:02.887 --> 43:03.887
Bye, Jethro.

43:04.187 --> 43:05.287
We miss you.
