WEBVTT

00:06.539 --> 00:08.234
You want some coffee, Kel?

00:08.274 --> 00:09.536
Yeah, thanks.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.242
Are you doing Tara's
laundry now, too?

00:13.279 --> 00:15.543
Clare, would you stop it.

00:15.582 --> 00:18.176
Tara's been a very good
houseguest and you know it.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.617
Yeah, she has, but, uh...

00:19.652 --> 00:21.313
that's not it.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.878
Then what is it?

00:24.090 --> 00:25.990
This is a three bedroom
apartment, Kel.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.753
It's fine to have a guest
for a couple nights.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.991
But this has been weeks now
without an end in sight.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.622
She's getting her own place.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.757
She's on a waiting list.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.961
That's what you said last week.

00:36.002 --> 00:37.492
Don't take this personally,

00:37.537 --> 00:40.768
but, um, I'm going to stay
with Steve until she's gone.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.331
Why?

00:44.844 --> 00:47.404
Can I be honest with you
and you won't get mad at me?

00:47.447 --> 00:48.675
Yeah.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.707
Tara gives me the creeps.

00:51.751 --> 00:54.584
I don't know why, there's just,
there's something about her.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.522
I totally respect what you're
doing for her, Kel, I do.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.457
I just feel put out
you know, I feel like

00:59.492 --> 01:02.154
I'm being displaced from my own
apartment, you know?

01:02.195 --> 01:04.220
You agree with her?

01:06.132 --> 01:08.066
I, uh, I think it would be
best for everyone

01:08.101 --> 01:10.661
if she found
her own place, soon.

01:10.703 --> 01:12.227
I don't understand.

01:12.272 --> 01:15.264
It's not like I didn't discuss
this with you first.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.536
I mean, you agreed to this

01:16.576 --> 01:18.635
and now you're
changing your mind.

01:18.678 --> 01:21.738
I just don't think
that's very fair to Tara.

01:21.781 --> 01:24.147
The beach was awesome
this morning.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.516
The waves were huge.

01:26.553 --> 01:27.918
Well, we better get to school.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.980
Have a good day.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.082
Hold on, guys, check it out.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.856
I found some great croissants
at this cafe on the strand.

01:35.895 --> 01:38.295
We're late for school.
Sorry, we gotta go.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.696
Yeah, we'll see you later, Kel.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.200
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.005
I'll try one.

01:50.076 --> 01:53.671
Hmm, they're still warm.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.546
They don't like me
too much, do they?

01:56.583 --> 01:58.278
Tara, you can't
please everyone.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.013
Still, I'm freeloading
in their apartment.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.486
I told you, you can stay

02:01.521 --> 02:03.250
as long as you need to.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.756
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.399 --> 03:56.630
So, I hear you and Clare
are playing house.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.000
Big responsibility, huh?

03:58.037 --> 03:59.402
We're not playing house.

03:59.439 --> 04:01.873
She's just staying over while
you guys cram, that's all.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.307
I feel for you, Steve.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.277
Clare's gonna get to see
all your bad habits,

04:05.311 --> 04:06.369
up close and personal.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.640
I don't have any bad habits.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.511
I know how to put
the toilet seat down.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.210
Ah, you've got Brandon
beat on that one.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.445
Aren't you late for something?

04:12.485 --> 04:14.646
- Yeah, yeah.
- See ya.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.952
Did you break the
bad news to her?

04:18.057 --> 04:20.890
Did you tell her your big plans
to spend the summer

04:20.927 --> 04:22.224
- together are canceled, huh?
- They aren't canceled.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.820
Oh, you didn't tell her?

04:23.863 --> 04:25.194
No, no, no, there's
nothing to tell, okay.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.664
I haven't even met
with the guy yet.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.291
I know you, Walsh,
you had a blast

04:28.334 --> 04:30.393
- in Boston last summer.
- So?

04:30.436 --> 04:33.337
So? You've got a great offer,
from an even better newspaper,

04:33.373 --> 04:34.863
they're grooming you for
a significant position.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.135
You'll never turn that down.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.302
Never, never, never, ever
and you shouldn't!

04:38.344 --> 04:40.778
Steve, Steve, Steve, this trip
means a lot to Susan, okay?

04:40.813 --> 04:42.974
It's not that cut-and-dry.

04:43.049 --> 04:46.109
Oh, sorry, Mr. Sensitive,
touchy-feely.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.552
Don't forget, Bran, men are men,

04:48.588 --> 04:51.352
business is business
and women...

04:51.391 --> 04:53.325
Whatever.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.064
So, what do you think?

05:02.101 --> 05:03.295
Sounds good.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.566
Sounds good?

05:05.605 --> 05:06.594
What are you kidding,
they're great.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.573
And they want me
to direct their video.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.269
Hey, Joe, you want
to listen to this?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.039
It's a campus band...
Powerman 5000.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.545
Sure, I'll take a listen.

05:13.579 --> 05:14.637
I'm telling you, Donna,

05:14.681 --> 05:16.273
all these guys need
is a dope video

05:16.316 --> 05:17.943
and they're as
good as signed.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.110
They're willing to put up their
own money for the production.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.347
I'm so psyched.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.082
Well, they picked the
right guy for the job.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.453
Especially if you're
this excited about it.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.048
I told them we could
do it this weekend.

05:26.092 --> 05:29.493
But we're really
up against the wall.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.156
I mean, finals start next week,

05:31.197 --> 05:32.596
and they're gonna
be going on tour.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.328
Don't worry about it. I mean,
you're the best under pressure.

05:35.368 --> 05:38.701
Yeah, I, I don't know,
I still don't think

05:38.738 --> 05:40.137
I can do this by myself.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.937
Come on, Donna, you've
got great instincts.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.569
I mean, we work well together,
what do you say?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.141
Well, it's not exactly my thing,
but they have a lot of energy.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.651
So, uh...

05:52.685 --> 05:54.482
can you help me out?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.817
Um...

05:55.855 --> 05:58.187
Okay, you got me
for the weekend.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.782
Great.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.919
I owe you one.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.189
Um, I'll give you a call later

06:03.229 --> 06:04.890
and, and we'll get
together at some point.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.330
I gotta get going.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.233
Here, you should take this tape
with you and learn the song.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.930
See you guys later.
See you later, Joe.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.096
Yeah, see you, Dave.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.504
Thanks, Donna.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.542
What was that all about?

06:17.577 --> 06:21.877
Oh, I'm going to help David make
a music video for this band.

06:21.914 --> 06:22.938
Really?

06:22.982 --> 06:24.574
Their music kind
of gave me a headache.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.278
What, you don't think
I should do it?

06:26.319 --> 06:27.411
I didn't say that.

06:27.453 --> 06:28.818
No, I mean,
I'm gonna be studying

06:28.855 --> 06:30.379
for my exams all weekend.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.856
Do it. I think you'd have fun.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.552
And if you can listen
to that all weekend,

06:33.593 --> 06:35.493
more power to you.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.928
You are so square sometimes.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.329
And that's why you love me.

06:39.365 --> 06:40.832
I guess so.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.300
- See ya, darlin'.
- Bye.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.764
Sometimes I think if my parents

06:48.808 --> 06:50.469
would have taken me back

06:50.510 --> 06:52.842
everything would be fine.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.473
But I made their life hell.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.710
I kept thinking the more
pathetic I got,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.843
the more they would want me.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.911
And now?

07:01.954 --> 07:04.548
They didn't even tell
me where they moved.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.582
Maybe someday
I'll get them back,

07:07.627 --> 07:09.891
but now,

07:09.929 --> 07:13.421
and for the first time
since I ran away...

07:13.466 --> 07:15.832
the world is a friendlier place.

07:15.868 --> 07:19.531
I have a friend and people who
care about me

07:19.572 --> 07:21.938
and that I care about.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.442
It's a real beginning.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.684
Hey, Colin, is Val around?

07:38.724 --> 07:41.215
Yeah.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.727
Yeah, she was.

07:42.762 --> 07:45.287
So, what does that mean?

07:45.331 --> 07:46.889
Is she coming back?

07:46.933 --> 07:49.265
I don't know, man.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.199
What's with the attitude, man?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.105
David...

07:56.142 --> 07:59.976
come on, brother,
you don't like me,

08:00.079 --> 08:02.547
you know I don't like you.

08:02.582 --> 08:07.110
Don't worry...
the feeling is mutual.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.280
Besides, I have this

08:09.322 --> 08:13.588
standing rule about not hanging
out with ex-felons, you know.

08:13.626 --> 08:14.991
Hmm.

08:16.796 --> 08:17.922
Val...

08:17.997 --> 08:20.761
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.665
I need to ask you a favor.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.363
Sure. What's up?

08:24.403 --> 08:26.303
I'm shooting this music video
this weekend

08:26.339 --> 08:28.830
and I was kind of hoping maybe
we could use the club

08:28.875 --> 08:30.172
for one of the locations
tomorrow.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.506
Now I talked to Nat

08:31.544 --> 08:34.274
and he's fine with it
as long as you are.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.506
Yeah, it's okay with me,

08:35.548 --> 08:37.379
as long as you're out of here
before we open.

08:37.416 --> 08:38.883
No problem.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.145
Thank you.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.049
See you later, Colin.

08:49.929 --> 08:52.124
What happened with you
and David?

08:53.966 --> 08:55.957
Who cares?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.866
- I care.
- Well, don't.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.099
He still blames me
for bringing Kelly down.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.573
One of these days, man...

09:02.608 --> 09:03.905
Can't you just lighten up?

09:04.010 --> 09:06.274
It's hard enough for me
to be stuck in the middle.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.611
Besides, don't you have
enough problems already?

09:19.659 --> 09:22.594
Can you believe
how fast time flies?

09:22.628 --> 09:25.392
We are already prepping for
the grad school exams.

09:25.431 --> 09:28.628
It seems like just
yesterday I took my SATs.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.067
I know.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.469
It reminds me that I'm not
going to be in school forever.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.872
I'm just glad we're taking
the summer off to travel.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.933
I'm looking forward to
putting my life on hold

09:38.010 --> 09:39.341
for a couple of months.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.939
Did you know that in a little
town off Interstate 80

09:43.015 --> 09:44.277
called Cauker City, Kansas,

09:44.317 --> 09:46.512
there is the largest ball
of twine in the world?

09:46.552 --> 09:49.146
Can you imagine... some farmer
made it his life's work

09:49.188 --> 09:52.715
and now it's the
town's pride and joy.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.956
Huh. You know I got a call
yesterday from the Boston Globe.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.156
They have a recruiter in town.

09:59.198 --> 10:02.565
He wants to meet with me.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.093
- Oh, about a summer job, huh?
- Yeah.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.697
They want to make a place
for me after I graduate.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.901
Wow, that's great.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.207
It may not even be anything
I want.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.076
But you're warning me our,
our trip may be off, right?

10:15.114 --> 10:18.743
Well, I gotta go meet
the guy, right?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.081
Yeah.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.986
No, I know you'll
do what you have to do.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.651
There you go.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.423
Now you've got two drawers
all to yourself.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.589
Thank you, honey.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.360
And I made room
in the closet for you.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.424
So, now this is kind
of like your room, too.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.730
Oh, you're so sweet.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.294
Well, I've never
done this before.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.306
You know, lived with someone.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.308
Well, it's only for
a couple days.

10:43.342 --> 10:46.140
Well, yeah, but I want to make
sure it's a nice place for you.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.873
That way I can be sure
you'll come back.

10:47.913 --> 10:50.438
You know what?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.417
You can be so romantic.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.976
Well, do me a favor, would ya?
Don't tell anybody.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.751
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.257
You know while you're
here with me,

10:59.291 --> 11:01.384
I don't want you
to lift a finger.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.327
I'm gonna wait on you
hand and foot.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.761
How does that sound?

11:04.797 --> 11:09.427
Mm, better than a poke in
the eye with a sharp stick.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.834
Well, how about a poke
in the old...

11:18.978 --> 11:20.912
Kelly, what do you think
of my hair?

11:20.946 --> 11:22.573
It's kind of mousy, huh?

11:22.615 --> 11:24.344
No, not at all.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.977
Oh, come on.
Look at us and tell me

11:27.019 --> 11:28.350
you don't see the difference.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.979
I mean, you've got it all:
style, flare.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.582
I'll never be anything
like you.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.186
Well, maybe it could
use a little pizzazz.

11:36.228 --> 11:39.789
Hmm. Pizzazz is for girls
like you, not me.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.096
Why don't I make you an
appointment at my hairdresser?

11:42.134 --> 11:43.465
lt'll be my treat.
You'll see.

11:43.502 --> 11:44.469
He does pizzazz.

11:44.503 --> 11:45.765
He could do that for me?

11:45.805 --> 11:47.238
Oh, are you kidding?
He works miracles.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.571
He'd have to be
to do anything with this.

11:49.608 --> 11:53.374
So, um, did Dr. Browning
mention anything to you

11:53.412 --> 11:55.539
about a place opening up
in a rooming house?

11:55.581 --> 12:00.143
Uh, yeah, she told me.

12:00.186 --> 12:03.155
What do you think?

12:03.189 --> 12:05.714
Please, don't make me go, Kelly.

12:05.758 --> 12:06.952
Kelly, you're like family,

12:07.026 --> 12:08.254
like a sister to me.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.956
You heard what I said in group.
I need you.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.897
I know. I just,
I have two roommates

12:14.934 --> 12:16.367
that I have to think about.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.836
How could you do this to me?

12:18.871 --> 12:20.202
I thought you were different.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.968
I'm sorry, Tara.

12:22.041 --> 12:26.068
You-You can stay at our place
until your place opens up.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.238
Please, Kelly.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.746
You promised
you would never leave me.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.249
I will prove to you I can be the
best friend you've ever had.

12:31.283 --> 12:32.443
Just don't make me leave.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.952
Tara, we are friends.

12:33.986 --> 12:38.548
I just think that it would be
best for everybody.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.325
Hey, Kelly.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.836
Hi.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.304
How you doing?

12:53.339 --> 12:55.000
Better every day.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.200
Yeah, Colin, too. It's amazing

12:56.242 --> 12:58.073
how things work out
for the best, huh?

12:59.879 --> 13:00.846
Hi.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.074
I'm sorry, Tara.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.604
This is Valerie and Colin.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.911
You were at

13:04.950 --> 13:06.076
Steve's party, right?

13:06.118 --> 13:07.142
Yeah, that was me.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.710
Nice to meet you guys.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.551
Well, we'll see you around,

13:10.589 --> 13:13.057
huh, Kel?

13:15.060 --> 13:17.358
- Bye.
- See ya.

13:17.396 --> 13:20.854
Wow, that's a really nice car.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.796
God, I hate her so much.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.396
I know I shouldn't feel
this way about anybody,

13:27.439 --> 13:28.804
but I do... I hate her.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.433
- Because of Colin?
- She has been

13:30.476 --> 13:31.670
after him since she asked him

13:31.710 --> 13:33.302
to paint that damn mural
at the club.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.313
Come on, Kelly.
You're just paranoid.

13:35.347 --> 13:37.315
Besides, Colin's no good
for you anyway.

13:37.349 --> 13:40.580
I know, but I still hate her.

13:40.619 --> 13:43.884
Well, anyone you hate...
I hate, too.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.385
I hope she dies.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.984
Tara, you don't even know them.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.083
It doesn't matter.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.619
That's what friends are for.

14:07.446 --> 14:08.606
All right, fine.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.672
Fine, scratch devils and angels.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.946
But I still think
it would've, uh,

14:12.985 --> 14:14.612
it would've worked
if we intercut it

14:14.653 --> 14:15.779
with the band footage.

14:15.821 --> 14:18.449
David, let's be realistic.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.424
We start taping at 8:00
in the morning.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.552
Where do you plan
on getting wings, halos

14:22.595 --> 14:24.927
and cloven hooves
to pull that off?

14:24.964 --> 14:26.761
Well, that's what I was hoping
you'd help me with.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.495
Uh, yeah,
but I'm not a miracle worker.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.766
Fine, why don't you come up
with an idea?

14:32.805 --> 14:34.397
Well, I have been coming up
with ideas,

14:34.440 --> 14:36.203
and you didn't like any of them,
remember that?

14:36.242 --> 14:37.209
Donna, they're too soft.

14:37.243 --> 14:38.335
This is a gritty song.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.401
It needs a gritty concept.

14:39.445 --> 14:40.469
Okay, fine.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.480
Why don't we
just keep it simple?

14:42.514 --> 14:44.539
I mean, the song's called
"Strike The Match,"

14:44.583 --> 14:45.914
so let's just have

14:45.951 --> 14:48.545
all the band members striking
lots of matches, hmm?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.488
Wow. That's...

14:51.523 --> 14:52.990
That's real clever.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.390
Well, it's more than you've had.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.724
You know what?

14:56.762 --> 14:58.787
If you don't want
to help on this, just say so.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.389
You know, I thought it might be
fun working together.

15:00.432 --> 15:01.922
You know,
doing something creative?

15:01.967 --> 15:05.334
I don't know why I asked you
to help me in the first place.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.539
Donna, where are you going?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.668
I'm leaving.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.143
You are being mean and rude,

15:13.178 --> 15:14.805
and right now, you are

15:14.847 --> 15:17.941
the last person on earth
I'd want to hang out with.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.250
Donna, stop! Stop, that's it!

15:21.287 --> 15:22.549
That's perfect!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.613
It's exactly what we've
been looking for.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.319
What are you talking about?

15:27.359 --> 15:32.160
"The last person on earth."

15:32.197 --> 15:35.098
It could be like a,
a post-apocalyptic theme.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.694
Like after a big war

15:37.736 --> 15:39.863
or a flood or a
famine or something.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.065
It's so simple.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.870
For wardrobe all we have
to do is rip up old clothes.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.274
Hey, that, that's not bad.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.471
You know, I could do that.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.638
You know what?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.944
Maybe we could rent out, like,
an old warehouse

15:49.982 --> 15:51.347
and do real smoky shots

15:51.383 --> 15:55.945
or make it look like a old alley
or something.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.888
Yeah, yeah. Okay, well,
what do we do

15:57.923 --> 15:59.151
with the drummer's
girlfriend, though?

15:59.191 --> 16:01.921
She could be the one striking
the matches.

16:01.961 --> 16:02.928
Everybody wants her

16:02.962 --> 16:04.327
because she's got
the fire, and they're...

16:04.363 --> 16:07.491
they're tired of eating
everything raw or something.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.522
Right,

16:08.567 --> 16:09.761
she's the last woman on earth.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.269
And they need her
for more than a hot meal.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.395
That's it!

16:12.438 --> 16:14.872
I like this.
I think this is gonna work.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.034
This is cool.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.636
Ready for antonyms?

16:20.679 --> 16:22.078
Okay, fire away.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.548
Okay, "multifarious:

16:24.583 --> 16:28.679
"A) Deprived of freedom,
B) Deprived of comfort,

16:28.721 --> 16:31.952
C) Lacking space,
or D) Lacking diversity?"

16:32.024 --> 16:34.390
D) Lacking diversity.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.326
- Correct.
- I didn't get that.

16:36.362 --> 16:37.329
I did.

16:37.363 --> 16:38.523
Well, antonyms are tricky.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.691
The correct answer's
never an exact opposite.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.291
It's always nearly opposite.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.131
What kind of career
would require you

16:44.169 --> 16:46.637
to know nearly exact opposites?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.139
Hopefully,
not air traffic controllers.

16:49.608 --> 16:50.734
I say we take a little break

16:50.776 --> 16:51.970
before we move on

16:52.077 --> 16:53.635
to the ever-intimidating
Data Analysis.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.169
What do you say, kids?
Who wants something?

16:55.214 --> 16:56.272
I'll have water.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.444
Clare, that shawl is beautiful.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.715
Where did you get it?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.451
Oh, it's a family heirloom.
It was my mom's.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.391
It's my lucky
study shawl now.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.320
It's one of the only things
I have from her.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.887
Well, it's beautiful.

17:12.931 --> 17:15.126
I'm gonna get some tea.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.173
Are we almost finished yet?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.198
What's the difference?
I'm sleeping over.

17:24.242 --> 17:27.804
Besides, just by
hanging with us,

17:27.846 --> 17:30.076
you're learning from osmosis.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.377
I'm bored.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.510
I've already used up
a week's worth of osmosis.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.486
Very good.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.752
Vocabulary usage in context.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.954
You know, you should have taken

17:42.027 --> 17:44.359
the graduate school exams.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.489
Yeah, this is what
I want to study for.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.280
Cool. Yeah, 8:00.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.651
All right, I'll see you then.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.121
Great.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.954
The band is all set for
the scenes in the After Dark.

18:47.025 --> 18:48.458
They're gonna bring
their own wardrobe.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.587
And they've got
some fans coming down.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.096
Now, you're taking care

18:52.131 --> 18:53.598
of the lead girl's
costume, right?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.759
Yeah, we'll get some
hot pants, fishnets.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.962
She has a great body,
it should work like a charm.

18:58.070 --> 18:58.968
Great.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.562
Oh, don't forget
lots of matches.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.905
Uh, those wooden ones that you
can strike on anything.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.375
Right. Lots of matches.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.877
Okay, everything's set.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.345
Great.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.677
I gotta say, I had a lot of fun.

19:09.715 --> 19:10.875
Yeah, well, uh,

19:10.916 --> 19:13.510
let's not celebrate
till you get it on tape.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.747
All right, you'd better get
some sleep.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.050
Yeah.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.626
Night, David.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.627
Good night.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.526
See you in the morning.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.264
You have a really nice car, Val.

20:02.301 --> 20:05.793
A really nice car.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.966
Well, I just want
this all to be over with

20:11.076 --> 20:12.304
because my stomach
is in knots.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.834
Come on, Keats,
it's good for you.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.847
A little pre-test jitters
gives you an edge.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.746
Yeah, or a stroke.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.842
Come on, guys.
This is just a warm-up.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.216
Next year
you can be nervous.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.481
Next year's the
last train out.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.352
If you don't have
your act together by then,

20:24.389 --> 20:25.822
you can kiss your academic
future good-bye.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.950
Ooh, don't get testy,
so to speak.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.551
It's just your
life on the line.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.456
Oh, to be an underachiever.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.158
That's right.
That's me, Clare.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.860
Graduate School
of Hard Knocks.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.426
Well, I'm outta here. I'm late.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.801
Good-bye. See you there.

20:39.838 --> 20:40.930
Bye, Clare.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.634
Honey, I'm gonna do
some laundry, later.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.403
Is there anything
I can do for you?

20:44.443 --> 20:47.571
Yeah, actually, the stuff on the
chair in your bedroom, okay?

20:47.613 --> 20:48.739
Warm wash, cold rinse.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.008
Got it.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.346
He's such a great
house husband. Bye.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.215
Mm, good wifey.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.949
Uh, these voices in my head
keep playing over and over,

21:00.993 --> 21:02.654
"Time to put down
your pencils,

21:02.694 --> 21:04.389
time to put
down your pencils."

21:04.429 --> 21:06.624
Susan, you're putting way
too much pressure on yourself.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.326
There are more
important things in life

21:08.367 --> 21:10.358
than where you're gonna go
to grad school.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.369
Like what?

21:11.403 --> 21:14.270
Where to do your
summer internship?

21:15.907 --> 21:17.568
Sorry.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.510
Aren't you getting a little
carried away with this?

21:20.545 --> 21:25.448
This year with you has meant
everything to me.

21:28.754 --> 21:33.123
I just want to know, are we...

21:33.158 --> 21:37.788
I mean, you and I,
are we a part of my future?

21:40.165 --> 21:43.464
Is this on the Data Analysis

21:43.502 --> 21:44.491
section of the test?

21:44.536 --> 21:46.265
Come on. I'm serious.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.466
I know.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.101
Look, all I'm asking is
that you think about it.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.405
And when you meet with the guy

21:52.444 --> 21:53.672
from the Boston Globe
about your job,

21:53.712 --> 21:55.805
I just want you

21:55.847 --> 21:58.543
to take into consideration
what...

21:58.583 --> 22:00.642
what you want
to have happen to us.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.347
Are you saying that
if I take the job

22:02.387 --> 22:04.446
and we don't go on our trip,
then we're finished?

22:04.489 --> 22:07.822
No, it isn't an ultimatum.

22:07.859 --> 22:08.689
Good.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.129
It's time to go.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.325
Perfect. Cut it.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.694
That was great.

22:45.731 --> 22:46.891
Yeah, it was good.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.729
I'd like to try it
one more time, though.

22:48.767 --> 22:51.201
Oh, hey, sure, no problem.
We can do it from the top

22:51.236 --> 22:52.726
and then we'll move on
to the next segment.

22:52.771 --> 22:53.999
Oh, Adam, by the way,

22:54.072 --> 22:55.334
when's your girlfriend
going to get here?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.342
We kind of need
to get her in wardrobe.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.003
Anna's still at Al's,
taking care of the dog.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.544
You're kidding?

23:00.579 --> 23:02.945
Why didn't anybody say anything?

23:02.981 --> 23:05.449
Why didn't you ask?
I mean...

23:07.652 --> 23:09.620
All right, that's no problem.

23:09.654 --> 23:12.145
Donna, you have
the wardrobe, right?

23:12.190 --> 23:13.179
Yeah, sure.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.852
Great.
Put it on.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.724
- Me?
- Yeah.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.593
You're about to be
the last woman on earth.

23:28.807 --> 23:30.672
Colin, somebody keyed my car!

23:30.709 --> 23:32.006
What?

23:35.247 --> 23:36.509
Oh...

23:36.548 --> 23:38.072
Hell of a way to start
the morning.

23:38.116 --> 23:40.243
- Who could've done this?
- Don't worry,

23:40.285 --> 23:42.719
it's probably just vandalism,
some stupid kids or something.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.813
This is not just vandalism.
They know my name.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.583
I'm calling the police.

23:49.628 --> 23:50.890
I'm scared.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.235
Thanks for the lift, Kel.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.243
No problem.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.676
I wanted you to meet
Bernie anyway.

24:06.711 --> 24:09.145
He was the only friend
I had on the streets.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.216
Here we go.

24:22.327 --> 24:23.919
Hey, Bernie!

24:25.530 --> 24:27.327
Tara!

24:27.365 --> 24:29.731
Hey.

24:29.768 --> 24:30.928
Where you been?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.129
I missed you.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.104
Hey, Bernie.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.401
- You look great.
- Thanks.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.839
This is my friend Kelly.

24:36.875 --> 24:37.899
Hi. Hi, Kelly.

24:37.943 --> 24:39.376
Nice to meet you.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.879
I was wondering if
I'd ever see you again.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.278
Well, here I am.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.215
By any chance,
do you still have my stuff?

24:45.250 --> 24:46.740
Of course I do.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.514
What do you think
I'd do, hock it?

24:48.553 --> 24:50.646
Thanks.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.486
I used to stay back there

24:52.524 --> 24:55.084
until Bernie caught me
doing drugs and threw me out.

24:55.126 --> 24:56.889
But he always
stayed my friend.

24:56.928 --> 24:58.953
I can't imagine
what it must've been like

24:58.997 --> 25:00.760
living in a place like this.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.357
Living on the streets...

25:02.400 --> 25:05.597
it's a character-
building experience.

25:05.637 --> 25:06.763
Here you go.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.705
Hey, you still have that
old camera I gave you?

25:08.740 --> 25:10.105
Yup, right in there.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.938
- She's a heck of a photographer.
- Really?

25:12.043 --> 25:13.340
- Well, enjoy.
- Thanks.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.846
And don't be such
a stranger, huh?

25:15.881 --> 25:17.815
- Okay.
- Thanks, Bernie.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.077
Nice to meet you, Kelly.

25:19.117 --> 25:20.084
- You, too.
- Okay.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.313
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:25.724 --> 25:28.124
Sure is nice to have
my stuff back again.

25:28.159 --> 25:30.184
It's good to see
a smile on your face.

25:30.228 --> 25:32.059
Come on, let's go see how
David and Donna are doing

25:32.097 --> 25:34.031
- on that video of theirs.
- Okay.

25:48.246 --> 25:49.304
Oh, no.

25:51.816 --> 25:54.478
Clare's mother's shawl.
She's gonna kill me!

26:03.528 --> 26:05.052
All right, now,

26:05.096 --> 26:06.461
you should start here

26:06.498 --> 26:08.898
and then when the
chorus part comes in,

26:08.934 --> 26:11.664
you should move down
to right about here.

26:11.703 --> 26:13.398
Okay, I'll give it a try.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.804
You look great.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.501
Thanks.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.840
Well, we're almost done lighting
and then we'll be ready to go.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.346
Cool.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.940
Wow, David really
knows what he's doing.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.951
Yeah, I knew Donna
was working on this,

26:27.052 --> 26:29.384
but I didn't know that
she was going to be in it.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.049
She looks great.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.819
Do you want to stay
and watch for awhile?

26:33.858 --> 26:34.950
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.653
- I'll go get us some sodas.
- Okay.

26:44.169 --> 26:45.727
This is all cool.
We've gotta make sure, though,

26:45.770 --> 26:47.135
that these two
spotlights up here

26:47.172 --> 26:48.867
are aimed on the center
of the stage at all times,

26:48.907 --> 26:50.636
otherwise we lose 'em.
We need the strobe lights.

26:50.675 --> 26:51.972
We needed those,
like, half an hour ago.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.068
We gotta find...

26:54.412 --> 26:56.277
What?

26:56.314 --> 26:57.872
Nothing.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.077
What, do you got a problem?

27:00.118 --> 27:02.052
No, I don't got a problem.
You got a problem.

27:02.087 --> 27:04.351
Really?

27:05.857 --> 27:07.825
Just stay out of my way,
all right?

27:07.859 --> 27:08.917
Stay out of your way?

27:09.027 --> 27:10.289
What, are you gonna make me?

27:10.328 --> 27:11.590
Huh?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.598
Maybe I will.

27:18.970 --> 27:19.937
Hey, Nat.

27:20.005 --> 27:21.165
Hi, darlin'.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.605
Looks like the Peach Pit
went big time.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.040
Yeah, did you see Donna?

27:24.075 --> 27:25.440
She looks like a movie star.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.037
Yeah, well, it looks like they
know what they're doing.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.637
And what can I do for you?

27:29.681 --> 27:31.842
- Two cherry sodas to go.
- Okay.

27:36.688 --> 27:38.918
Kelly, I need to talk to you.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.117
What?

27:40.158 --> 27:42.149
Someone vandalized
my car last night.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.388
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.158
What's that
have to do with me?

27:46.197 --> 27:47.858
Well, they scratched the words
"Die Val" in the side of my car

27:47.899 --> 27:49.423
and I can't think
of anybody else

27:49.467 --> 27:50.729
who wants me dead besides you.

27:50.769 --> 27:53.067
Well, maybe you're not thinking
hard enough.

27:53.104 --> 27:54.332
You know, this isn't a joke.

27:54.372 --> 27:55.600
I've called the police.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.471
And you're number one
on my list of people

27:57.509 --> 27:58.976
I told them might have
a grudge against me.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.671
You're crazy.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.577
- And you're paranoid.
- Yeah, right.

28:02.614 --> 28:03.842
Like you haven't
had it in for me

28:03.882 --> 28:05.281
since I took Colin
away from you.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.547
You did not take Colin
away from me, I dumped him.

28:08.586 --> 28:10.747
And you were the only thing
low enough for him to crawl to.

28:10.789 --> 28:13.121
You're a bitch, you know that.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.183
You want to take it outside?

28:15.226 --> 28:16.284
Glad to.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.495
Hey, there's a fight next door!

28:18.530 --> 28:20.361
Come on, there's a fight!

28:28.506 --> 28:29.700
David, stop it!

28:29.741 --> 28:31.072
Come on, man, let go of me!

28:31.109 --> 28:32.940
Get off of me! Let go of me!
I'm sick of this punk!

28:32.977 --> 28:34.035
Nat!

28:35.013 --> 28:36.446
Stop!

28:36.481 --> 28:37.470
- Come on!
- That's enough!

28:37.515 --> 28:38.743
That's enough!
Break it up!

28:38.783 --> 28:39.943
- I didn't start it, man.
- Man, I didn't touch

28:40.018 --> 28:41.349
Valerie's car.
You need to know what

28:41.386 --> 28:43.081
you're talking about before you
accuse people of things.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.816
I know exactly what I'm
talking about, all right?

28:44.856 --> 28:46.255
- Come on.
- Did Kelly put you up to this?

28:46.291 --> 28:48.452
- What?!
- Come on! Come on!

28:48.493 --> 28:51.223
All right, all right, all right,
take him outside!

28:51.262 --> 28:53.787
Come on.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.526
As far as I'm concerned,
this shoot is over.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.003
Nat...

29:02.040 --> 29:04.531
David, I'm sorry.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.669
She's right, man. Chill.

29:07.812 --> 29:10.337
- Damn it.
- Are you okay?

29:12.150 --> 29:14.345
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.012
We'll just get
whatever we didn't get

29:16.054 --> 29:17.385
when we move on
to the warehouse.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.389
David, I'm sorry.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.617
She accused me
of the same thing.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.852
What's gotten into them?

29:21.893 --> 29:23.520
They really are bad.

29:23.561 --> 29:25.222
No wonder you guys
hate them so much.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.108
Mr. Dreesen.

29:40.145 --> 29:41.510
- Brandon Walsh.
- Yes, sir.

29:41.546 --> 29:43.036
- How do you do?
- Good, thank you.

29:43.081 --> 29:44.070
Please, join me.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.104
Thanks.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.139
Sorry, I'm a little late.

29:46.184 --> 29:47.344
I took my GREs today.

29:47.385 --> 29:48.613
No problem.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.143
So how's your year been?

29:50.188 --> 29:51.155
Good, good.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.213
Great, actually. Thanks.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.884
- Grades up?
- Uh, yeah.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.859
Actually,
I'm looking at a 3.5.

29:55.894 --> 29:57.225
- Very good.
- Yeah.

29:57.262 --> 29:59.162
And I know you've been
very active with The Condor.

29:59.197 --> 30:01.665
We were very impressed
with that copy you filed

30:01.699 --> 30:03.428
for the AP on the
Bradley assault trial.

30:03.468 --> 30:04.833
- Thank you.
- And then of course,

30:04.869 --> 30:06.359
word got around town
about the work you did

30:06.404 --> 30:08.235
for The Herald last summer.

30:08.273 --> 30:09.763
They were very happy
with you.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.866
That's good to hear.

30:10.909 --> 30:12.877
- I'm a big fan of Boston.
- Good.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.243
Because we would like to have
you come back this summer.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.611
And I don't suppose
I have to tell you

30:16.648 --> 30:18.445
that working for
The Boston Globe

30:18.483 --> 30:19.950
would be a considerable step up

30:19.984 --> 30:21.417
from your affiliation
last summer.

30:21.452 --> 30:22.544
Well, I understand.

30:22.587 --> 30:23.713
And, frankly, Mr. Walsh,

30:23.755 --> 30:25.985
we are in a very aggressive
recruiting period.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.990
We're prepared
to extend ourselves

30:28.092 --> 30:29.354
beyond a summer internship.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.158
But that would take
some commitment on your part.

30:32.197 --> 30:34.324
Well, what exactly
did you have in mind?

30:34.365 --> 30:36.162
Well, we know you're gonna be
a senior next year.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.964
And, of course, it would be
in all our best interests

30:38.002 --> 30:38.969
that you finish your degree.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.800
But if you come on board

30:40.839 --> 30:42.170
with us this summer,

30:42.207 --> 30:44.300
there would be a job waiting
for you when you graduate.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.307
That might make
for a relatively

30:47.345 --> 30:48.812
stress-free senior year.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.474
- Yeah, it might.
- Now, of course,

30:50.515 --> 30:52.005
we'd like you to work
from the bottom up.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.917
But you'd be starting
with a very competitive salary

30:54.953 --> 30:56.648
and a full benefits package.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.883
I don't understand.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.515
Why are you recruiting me
as a junior?

31:00.558 --> 31:01.616
We like to make

31:01.659 --> 31:04.219
special exceptions
for special candidates.

31:04.262 --> 31:06.526
We'd rather take you
off the market

31:06.564 --> 31:08.225
than have to compete for you
next year.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.734
Wow.

31:13.738 --> 31:14.966
That's quite an offer.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.904
We think so.

31:16.941 --> 31:19.136
Wow.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.405
You already said that, Brandon.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.639
Yeah, yeah, I did.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.204
I'm sorry.

31:24.249 --> 31:25.978
And all of this is contingent

31:26.050 --> 31:28.280
on me coming to work
for you this summer?

31:28.319 --> 31:29.445
Yeah, it would be
a grooming period.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.216
A chance for us
to evaluate your strengths,

31:31.256 --> 31:32.484
find out where you fit.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.886
So what do you think?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.691
Well, I was kinda planning on
taking this summer off.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.494
I don't think this is the summer
to be goofing off, do you?

31:54.512 --> 31:56.002
Let me make you
some herbal tea.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.980
You need to relax.

31:58.016 --> 32:01.918
I just cannot believe the nerve
of them to accuse me.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.853
She probably keyed her own car
just to blame it on you.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.253
I wouldn't put it past her.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.279
She's a witch.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.918
Trust me, when you live
on the streets,

32:08.960 --> 32:12.191
you learn to spot the meanness
in people in order to survive.

32:12.230 --> 32:14.061
I just feel bad for David.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.896
I wish he didn't have to get
sucked into this, you know?

32:19.671 --> 32:22.105
Maybe I will take you up
on that tea.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.836
Thanks for making
that appointment

32:29.881 --> 32:31.075
with your hairdresser for me.

32:31.115 --> 32:32.241
I can't wait.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.978
Oh, you're welcome.
Just don't be late.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.849
He was completely booked up
this afternoon

32:35.887 --> 32:37.787
and he is squeezing you in.

32:37.822 --> 32:40.086
No, no, I'm staying
here with you; you need me.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.115
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm fine.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.794
Why didn't you ever tell me
you were a photographer?

32:47.832 --> 32:49.424
I don't know.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.458
It didn't seem important.

32:51.502 --> 32:52.992
I love taking pictures, though.

32:53.104 --> 32:54.469
It was the only thing

32:54.505 --> 32:56.598
that seemed to keep me
sane on the streets.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.132
I spent every penny
I had on film.

32:59.177 --> 33:01.372
And I took a picture
of every person I met

33:01.412 --> 33:02.572
and every place I went.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.104
Hm. Sounds like a calling.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.276
- You think?
- Yeah.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.445
I'd love to see
some of your stuff.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.717
Me, too.
I could afford the film,

33:11.756 --> 33:14.816
but not the processing
and the printing.

33:14.859 --> 33:16.884
Do you happen to know anybody
with a darkroom?

33:16.928 --> 33:20.329
Actually, I may be able
to help you there.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.593
Really?

33:21.632 --> 33:23.896
Yeah, a newspaper
would have a darkroom, right?

33:23.935 --> 33:24.924
Of course.

33:24.969 --> 33:26.231
Well, the The Condor
must have one.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.534
I'll just ask Brandon
to do me a favor.

33:28.573 --> 33:29.699
He would do that for you?

33:29.741 --> 33:32.335
If I ask him nicely.

33:33.845 --> 33:38.248
You still like him,
don't you?

33:38.282 --> 33:40.409
I think he likes you, too.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.078
Another one of my instincts.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.088
Oh, really?

33:44.122 --> 33:46.181
Well, I'm going to go
take a shower and a nap.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.317
But don't be late for Umberto
or he will kill me, all right?

33:48.359 --> 33:49.758
- I won't.
- All right.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.158
And cut it!

35:28.192 --> 35:29.625
That was great.
Here, come on down.

35:29.660 --> 35:30.854
I have another shot idea.

35:30.895 --> 35:32.624
Okay, let me go, uh,
fix my makeup.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.324
Oh. Sure. Go ahead.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.509
Hey.

35:45.543 --> 35:46.669
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.305
Wow. Look at you.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.178
I didn't know you
were gonna be in this.

35:51.215 --> 35:52.182
Yeah, neither did I.

35:52.216 --> 35:53.308
So, are your tests finished?

35:53.351 --> 35:54.409
Yeah.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.853
That's a...
an interesting outfit.

35:57.889 --> 36:01.450
It's my last-woman-on-earth
costume. You dig it?

36:01.492 --> 36:02.618
Donna!

36:02.660 --> 36:03.888
We're ready for your close up.

36:03.928 --> 36:04.917
Yeah, okay. You know what?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.088
This shouldn't take long.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.461
Why don't you stay and watch?

36:07.498 --> 36:08.522
Okay.

36:08.566 --> 36:10.158
Okay. Bye.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.339
Uh, just do the same
thing you were doing.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.540
Just try and keep the
energy up, the sexiness. Y...

36:22.580 --> 36:24.605
You know what you're
doing. Feed the camera.

36:24.649 --> 36:26.276
Uh, roll 'em, play back.

37:06.424 --> 37:07.914
So.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.449
How'd your big meeting go?

37:09.493 --> 37:11.461
Great.

37:11.495 --> 37:12.553
Great. That's good.

37:12.597 --> 37:13.825
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

37:13.864 --> 37:15.126
Yeah, it's really good,
actually.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.656
You won't believe
what they offered me.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.794
Pray tell.

37:20.304 --> 37:21.794
All I have to do is intern

37:21.839 --> 37:24.137
for one of the best newspapers
in the country this summer,

37:24.175 --> 37:25.938
and, uh, when I graduate,

37:25.977 --> 37:28.275
they'll guarantee me a job
with full benefits...

37:28.312 --> 37:29.506
if I want it.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.779
Whoa.

37:32.817 --> 37:33.943
Well, you deserve it.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.350
You're very talented, Brandon.

37:56.474 --> 37:57.463
What?

37:57.508 --> 37:58.805
I'm not finished.

37:58.843 --> 38:00.936
I don't think there's
anything more to say

38:00.978 --> 38:02.445
right now.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.505
All right.

38:04.548 --> 38:05.606
Then, uh...

38:05.650 --> 38:07.914
let me show you something.

38:07.985 --> 38:09.111
What?

38:09.153 --> 38:10.415
This.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.921
What is it?

38:11.956 --> 38:13.150
It's incredible, isn't it?

38:13.190 --> 38:15.055
What? W-What is it?

38:15.092 --> 38:17.754
It's a tiny ball
of knotted string.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.592
A knot?

38:19.630 --> 38:21.063
You want to show me a knot?

38:21.098 --> 38:22.292
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

38:22.333 --> 38:25.131
This isn't just a knot.

38:25.169 --> 38:27.467
This is the smallest ball
of twine in the world.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.632
And now that we've
seen the smallest one,

38:29.674 --> 38:32.142
don't you think we owe it to
ourselves to see the biggest?

38:34.178 --> 38:35.611
You mean it?

38:35.646 --> 38:37.580
Our summer together?

38:37.615 --> 38:40.015
If you still want to.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.653
You mean you'd give up this
incredible offer for me?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.954
Well, the truth is,
I already did.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.822
Besides, if I wait
until next year,

38:49.860 --> 38:51.953
they'll have to pay me more.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.156
You sure?

38:53.197 --> 38:54.960
I mean, it is such
a great opportunity,

38:54.999 --> 38:57.968
and if you change your mind,
I mean, I'll understand.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.334
No, no.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.566
We only have one
more summer like this.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.233
We should make it one
to remember, huh?

39:04.275 --> 39:05.469
Okay.

39:11.949 --> 39:13.473
Honey! I'm home.

39:15.319 --> 39:16.843
- Hey, babe.
- Hi!

39:18.155 --> 39:19.122
How'd it go?

39:19.156 --> 39:20.646
Easier than I thought.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.215
I'm glad we crammed.
It really helped.

39:22.259 --> 39:24.090
Ooh, wow.
Beautiful flowers.

39:24.128 --> 39:26.255
Yeah. They're for you.

39:26.297 --> 39:27.787
Really?

39:27.832 --> 39:29.060
What did I do to deserve?

39:29.100 --> 39:31.125
Oh, nothing.
Just for being you.

39:31.168 --> 39:33.261
Oh. That's sweet.

39:33.304 --> 39:36.432
You know, I'm gonna have
to move in more often.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.109
Geez, this kitchen
is spotless.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.475
You've been busy, huh?

39:41.512 --> 39:43.139
Well, I try.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.875
I know.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.348
You've been really
great to me, Steve.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.285
Well, I really try,

39:49.320 --> 39:51.515
and sometimes it doesn't
always go the way I planned.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.647
That's okay.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.818
It's not okay.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.122
Clare, something's happened.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.594
What are you talking about?

39:58.629 --> 40:00.859
Well, I-I did your laundry.

40:00.898 --> 40:04.163
Did you mix my whites
in with my colors?

40:04.201 --> 40:06.635
No, I know how
to do the wash.

40:06.670 --> 40:09.503
Well, what, then?

40:09.540 --> 40:10.768
Clare, don't hate me for this,

40:10.808 --> 40:12.776
but I, uh...

40:12.810 --> 40:14.300
I accidentally washed
your mom's shawl

40:14.345 --> 40:15.676
with the rest of the laundry.

40:15.713 --> 40:17.476
Oh, no.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.005
It's pretty bad.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.409
Where is it? Let me see it.

40:34.565 --> 40:35.896
It's, um...

40:39.570 --> 40:41.504
How could you do this?

40:41.539 --> 40:43.166
You knew what this
meant to me, Steve.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.539
Clare, I'm sorry.

40:45.576 --> 40:46.668
Look.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.678
I bought you a whole
bunch of other shawls.

40:48.712 --> 40:51.010
There's some really
beautiful ones here. Look...

40:51.048 --> 40:52.538
Look at this one.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.175
It's kinda like that
one, isn't it?

40:54.218 --> 40:55.583
It's almost the same.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.883
But it's not my mom's.

40:59.056 --> 41:01.149
I know.

41:01.192 --> 41:02.625
Clare, please,
I didn't notice it.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.719
It was on the chair
with your other stuff.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.857
I can't undo what's done.

41:08.899 --> 41:10.992
I would if I could,
honey, but...

41:17.241 --> 41:21.177
You're not gonna forgive me.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.611
I guess I deserve it.

41:24.348 --> 41:26.043
As much as this meant to me...

41:28.552 --> 41:29.746
...I forgive you.

41:29.787 --> 41:30.754
You do?

41:30.788 --> 41:31.982
It was an accident.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.751
I know you love me and...

41:34.792 --> 41:36.384
you'd never do
anything to hurt me.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.827
I wouldn't, Clare. I swear.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.497
Come here.

41:46.003 --> 41:50.531
You're a good guy.

41:50.574 --> 41:52.542
I know my mom would approve.

41:59.483 --> 42:02.281
God, I am so exhausted,

42:02.319 --> 42:03.946
but I did have fun.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.148
Looked like it.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.953
Can you believe what happened
with Valerie and Colin?

42:08.058 --> 42:10.492
Donna, I promised myself

42:10.528 --> 42:12.359
I wasn't gonna talk
about them any more today.

42:12.396 --> 42:15.297
Well, I can understand that.

42:15.332 --> 42:16.822
You know,
I have to admit, though,

42:16.867 --> 42:18.494
sometimes I really like Val.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.197
It's like one minute she's nice,

42:20.237 --> 42:22.762
the next she just...
goes off the deep end.

42:22.806 --> 42:24.239
Like thinking
that I would get up

42:24.275 --> 42:26.368
in the middle of the night,
go over to Colin's

42:26.410 --> 42:28.571
- and vandalize her car.
- I know.

42:28.612 --> 42:30.978
I just hope the police catches
whoever did it, you know.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.812
Maybe you guys could make up.

42:32.850 --> 42:34.511
I don't think that Valerie
and I will ever

42:34.552 --> 42:35.780
be seeing eye-to-eye
on anything.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.811
Hey, guys, I'm home.

42:41.358 --> 42:43.155
Is this pizzazz or what?

42:45.696 --> 42:47.960
So, how do you like the new me?

42:47.998 --> 42:50.899
How could you do this?

42:50.935 --> 42:52.994
Do what?

42:53.070 --> 42:54.765
You know exactly
what you did, Tara.

42:54.805 --> 42:56.272
You sent me to him.

42:56.307 --> 42:58.207
I-I just told him to make me
look as good as you.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.177
I don't want to talk about this.

43:01.211 --> 43:02.473
What... what did I do?

43:02.513 --> 43:03.639
Donna, what did I do?

43:03.681 --> 43:05.808
Uh...

43:05.849 --> 43:07.146
Maybe we just need

43:07.184 --> 43:09.880
a little time to get used
to the new you.

43:22.132 --> 43:25.829
We told you she was weird.

43:25.869 --> 43:27.632
She wants to be you, Kel.
