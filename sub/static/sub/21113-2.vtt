WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:02.436
- Meet three besties killing it
in New York City.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.307
- Lady, move your ass.
- My friend

00:06.340 --> 00:08.209
is having a moment.
- Kat, "Scarlett" magazine's

00:08.242 --> 00:09.777
social media director
told a lesbian artist

00:09.810 --> 00:12.480
that she isn't into...
- This.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.582
- But clearly she is.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.150
Jane just landed her dream job.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.052
All she has to do now

00:18.086 --> 00:19.520
is write about
her most embarrassing moments.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.522
- Give me what you got.
- Easy.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.358
Sutton is the hardest-working
assistant in Manhattan,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.460
but she wants to do
so much more,

00:26.494 --> 00:28.829
and she already is--a board
member named Richard Hunter.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.631
These women are...

00:31.632 --> 00:34.202
[dynamic music]

00:34.235 --> 00:38.639
- * I feel like fire

00:38.672 --> 00:40.208
* I feel like rain

00:40.241 --> 00:43.311
*

00:43.344 --> 00:44.845
- It can't be done.
- Agreed.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.081
- But maybe.
- No way.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.183
- No, it's--it's a no, right?
- No, it's a maybe.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.319
What did Sage say,
exactly?

00:51.352 --> 00:53.487
- Just that she wants me
to verify that

00:53.521 --> 00:56.257
it's physically possible before
sending it up to Jacqueline.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.226
- Oh, I think you're
getting hazed, babe.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.660
- I'm not getting hazed!

01:00.694 --> 01:02.496
Ugh, I'm getting hazed.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.565
- No, no, no, I think
we can do this.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.267
Get up on this thing.
- Yeah.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.837
- Excuse me?
- Come on, help me help you.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.540
I'm gonna need you
to kind of, like...

01:12.573 --> 01:14.642
- Yeah, but with your legs
you got to...

01:14.675 --> 01:16.610
Oh!
- That's great.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.246
- Wow.
- Wow, those barre classes

01:18.279 --> 01:19.447
are really working out for you.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.681
You're so strong.
- Yeah.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.616
- Okay, it's a two-person job.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.685
- Yeah, wait, can I be the dude?
- Yes.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.487
- Yeah!
- Sure.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.189
- So then you should
probably go--

01:28.222 --> 01:29.557
- If I go--
- Nope.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.292
- Turn the other way.
- Nope.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.693
- Yeah, flip it.
- All right, cool, cool, cool.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.230
- And then just...

01:36.264 --> 01:37.631
- Is this good for you?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.601
- Great for me so far.
- Okay, and then push up.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.438
- Does this look sexy?
'Cause it doesn't feel sexy?

01:44.472 --> 01:46.240
- This is pretty--
- Good morning, ladies.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.641
- Oh, my g--hi.

01:47.675 --> 01:48.676
- Hello.
- Good morning.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.145
- Hi. Um, we were just--

01:51.179 --> 01:53.614
- Verifying a new sex position.
And?

01:53.647 --> 01:58.519
- I...I don't think
it's physically possible.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.728
- Oh, no,
this is absolutely possible.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.230
Staff meeting in 15.
Consider this approved.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.598
- * And baby, worship me

02:10.631 --> 02:13.667
*

02:13.701 --> 02:15.236
* Worship me

02:15.269 --> 02:17.137
*

02:18.706 --> 02:20.341
- Anyone else read
the latest advice

02:20.374 --> 02:22.376
from our hot friend downstairs?

02:22.410 --> 02:24.312
- [laughs]

02:24.345 --> 02:25.913
I'm sorry, is he kidding
with this advice?

02:25.946 --> 02:29.250
I mean, who wants to
F-asterisk-percentage sign-K

02:29.283 --> 02:30.684
like a porn star?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.720
- Uh, if it was with him?
Might make an effort.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.657
- Yeah, but this is just
typical male fantasy crap.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.261
I mean, that's not what
real men want, is it?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.763
Being the only man in the room,
this is directed at you.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.765
- Am I allowed
to respectfully abstain?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.667
[light laughter]

02:46.700 --> 02:48.636
- No.
- Okay, I'll be honest.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.405
I think there's a reason
his column is so popular.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.241
- Yes, with men.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.943
- Well, it is a men's magazine.
Men watch porn.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.212
- Yeah, and so do women.
A study just came out

02:58.246 --> 03:00.414
that one in three women
are regularly watching porn.

03:00.448 --> 03:03.651
- That cannot be true.
- Show of hands.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.421
Hmm. All right, Sage,

03:07.455 --> 03:09.690
you've got your assignment--
Porn: love it or hate it?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.625
It's clearly something
we need to be talking about.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.993
Let's make a feature
piece out of it,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.662
which means we need somebody

03:14.695 --> 03:17.365
to cover your sex
column this month.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.700
Jane.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.436
- Oh, uh, actually,
I had this political piece

03:22.470 --> 03:24.372
that I wanted to pitch to you.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.274
I'm really excited about it--
- Well, that can wait.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.309
We need a sex column.
- Yeah, but I'm not exactly--

03:28.342 --> 03:30.578
- I know you're not exactly.
That's why I want you doing it.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.681
- Oh, we haven't done a best
orgasm piece in a while.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.583
Those are always strong.
- That's great.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.684
All right.
I look forward to it.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.719
What else we got? Alex?

03:38.752 --> 03:41.789
- Spooning or forking.
Which one makes you hungrier?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.691
- All right, so the response

03:43.724 --> 03:46.494
to our sexual health campaign
has been good and bad.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.462
The links are being
heavily read but not shared.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.698
- People don't love
retweeting about herpes.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.700
- I'm already on it.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.269
I, uh, added a few feel-goods
to help boost our likes, okay?

03:55.303 --> 03:58.572
- What about that Adena piece,
the Muslim photographer?

03:58.606 --> 04:01.375
That got us some good traffic.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.778
- Yeah, um, yeah,
but it's been a few weeks.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.447
Attention on it's kind
of died down.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.382
- So why aren't you doing
a follow-up?

04:08.416 --> 04:11.485
- I--I've actually tried
to get into contact with her,

04:11.519 --> 04:13.354
but she's been
a little tough to reach,

04:13.387 --> 04:15.523
or a lot tough to reach,
actually.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.491
She deleted all of her
social media accounts.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.727
- Well, I know this is
a fairly controversial idea

04:19.760 --> 04:21.061
for your generation, but...

04:21.094 --> 04:22.763
have you considered
telephoning her?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.765
I thought you were
grabbing me ten minutes ago.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.500
- The board pushed
the meeting ten minutes.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.068
You're right on time.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.304
She's not in a very
good mood, is she?

04:30.338 --> 04:31.672
- Mm, she's in as good a mood
as she gets.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.641
Do not wuss out.
- I don't know.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.343
- I do. Now go.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.879
Hey, Sutton, you got this.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.649
- Hey, Lauren, I was hoping
to catch you for a quick minute

04:41.682 --> 04:43.083
before the meeting starts.
- Uh-huh.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.052
- I've been on your desk
for three years.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.720
I've worked incredibly hard.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.722
I like to think that
I've made your life easier,

04:48.756 --> 04:51.792
and it's been an amazing
learning experience, but...

04:51.825 --> 04:54.328
I think I'm ready
for the next step.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.568
- So what exactly are you
asking me here?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.102
- I'm trying to be
more proactive.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.672
- What job do you want?
What department?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.740
- I was a biz econ
major in college,

05:06.774 --> 05:08.676
but I haven't actually
had the opportunity

05:08.709 --> 05:11.679
to explore the business
side of the magazine.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.113
- Hmm. I'm impressed.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.417
Most girls come here
with these crazy dreams,

05:16.450 --> 05:18.686
wanting to do something
they're totally unqualified for.

05:18.719 --> 05:22.823
I respect that you want
to do something practical.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.425
Okay, well, let's get some

05:24.458 --> 05:26.360
informational interviews
set up for you.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.429
- Really? Wow, thanks.
- Richard.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.431
- Yes?
- I have a favor to ask you.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.533
- Oh, no, he shouldn't
because I--

05:32.566 --> 05:34.635
He's so high-level,
I wouldn't want to trouble him.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.836
- Sutton, we need to
get you better

05:35.869 --> 05:37.705
at speaking up
for yourself.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.574
Could you spare 15 minutes
to talk to my assistant

05:40.608 --> 05:42.576
about the business side
of the magazine?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.344
- Of course.
- Fantastic.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.621
[pensive music]

05:53.654 --> 06:01.395
*

06:12.773 --> 06:14.675
[line ringing]

06:14.708 --> 06:16.610
[disconnect signal]
- We're sorry.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.780
Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.655
[background chatter]

06:29.723 --> 06:31.892
- She wants me to do
a best orgasm piece.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.794
- Oh, those are fun.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.729
- This is your worst nightmare
in the best possible way.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.565
- Yeah, I can't write this.
- Sure you can.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.433
Just open a bottle of gin,
chase it with nothing,

06:39.467 --> 06:40.868
start typing.
- Who was your best orgasm ever?

06:40.901 --> 06:44.171
It had to have been Eric, right?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.706
- No.
- Really?

06:45.739 --> 06:46.774
- Doesn't surprise me.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.542
Men are always such a letdown.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.177
I can get the job done
better myself.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.779
- That's because you never stick
around long enough.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.647
Takes time to train them.

06:53.681 --> 06:54.915
Speaking of men I've trained,

06:54.948 --> 06:56.917
Lauren cornered Richard
into giving me

06:56.950 --> 06:59.186
an informational
interview later.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.888
- When are you just gonna admit
you want to work in fashion?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.823
- Everybody wants to work
in fashion.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.925
It requires this little
magical thing called talent.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.994
- You have talent.
- Do you know that Lauren

07:07.027 --> 07:11.632
told me she respected me for
choosing something practical?

07:11.665 --> 07:14.502
Lauren has never told me
that she respects me.

07:14.535 --> 07:17.871
- Okay, my turn. I had a sex
dream about Adena last night.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.808
- What?
- Yeah, I know. It was so weird.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
- But sometimes sex dreams...
- Guys?

07:22.710 --> 07:24.545
- Don't really mean sex.
- No, this one did.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.979
- You guys.
- Wow, we're gonna have to

07:26.013 --> 07:27.848
unpack this.
- You guys!

07:30.718 --> 07:32.786
I can't write this story
because...

07:32.820 --> 07:35.789
I've never had an orgasm before.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.764
- I'm gonna need a more
detailed description of never.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.499
- Like, never.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.867
- Like, not even with yourself?
- Correct.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.802
Like the basic definition
of the word never.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.771
- Hostile.
- She's allowed to be hostile.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.805
She's never had
an orgasm before.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.707
- I'm fine, okay?
It just--

07:53.741 --> 07:55.509
I feel like a fraud.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.578
We work for this magazine
that's all about

07:57.611 --> 07:59.079
having the most
amazing sex ever,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.749
and you guys are having
the most amazing sex,

08:01.782 --> 08:04.652
and Jacqueline obviously is.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.253
[sighs]

08:06.286 --> 08:07.921
I can't tell Jacqueline.

08:07.955 --> 08:11.825
I just need to figure out
a way to have an orgasm.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.795
- Okay, so let's make it happen.
- Loving the can-do spirit.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.730
- I'm a problem-solver.
- Yeah.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.532
- Okay, here's what we're gonna
do--we're gonna call your gyno.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.000
She's gonna rule out
anything physiological.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.769
- You think it could
be something physiological?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.837
- No, I think you're
very highly strung

08:23.871 --> 08:25.839
and probably have trouble
getting out of your own head,

08:25.873 --> 08:27.307
but we need to at least
check in on your vageen.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.509
[phone chimes]

08:32.312 --> 08:33.881
- Great, it's Jacqueline.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.916
She wants me
to come to her office.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.086
God, does she have
this place bugged?

08:44.825 --> 08:47.628
- Kat? There's somebody
at the front desk for you.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.062
- Okay, thank you.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.770
- Surprise.

08:56.804 --> 09:00.674
- Adena, hi.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.809
Good to see you.

09:05.646 --> 09:14.888
Oh, my God.
[laughs]

09:14.922 --> 09:18.091
- After you got out,
I texted you a lot,

09:18.125 --> 09:22.830
so you better have a good excuse
for ghosting me.

09:22.863 --> 09:26.066
- Well, I don't know
if it's a good excuse,

09:26.099 --> 09:28.969
but after I was detained
at the airport,

09:29.002 --> 09:32.873
I received, um, an increase
in death threats.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.942
- Oh, Adena--
- It's okay, but, um,

09:34.975 --> 09:36.810
we've been hearing
for a while

09:36.844 --> 09:38.045
that American
immigration officers

09:38.078 --> 09:39.847
are looking through
Muslims' phones,

09:39.880 --> 09:41.615
so I ditched mine.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.916
- That's probably
the best excuse

09:42.950 --> 09:44.985
for not returning
a text I have ever heard.

09:45.018 --> 09:49.923
- But I--I want you to know
that I did receive your picture.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.892
- Oh, yeah, it was--
that was stupid.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.393
I was trying to be funny.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
- It wasn't stupid.

09:54.962 --> 10:00.868
Maybe a little funny,
but...

10:00.901 --> 10:02.369
you touched me here too.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.105
[soft music]

10:05.138 --> 10:08.942
[phone chimes, buzzes]

10:10.711 --> 10:12.379
Anyway, my manager told me

10:12.412 --> 10:15.082
that you needed something
from me for the magazine?

10:15.115 --> 10:19.720
- Oh, right, yeah, uh,
your article was really popular,

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022
so we want to do
a little follow-up interview.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.757
If you could sit down
with one of our writers,

10:23.791 --> 10:25.926
I think Alex probably
has some time?

10:25.959 --> 10:30.664
- I have to run today,
but Thursday I have a show.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.432
It's downtown at a gallery.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.936
If he can come to that,
I would love to speak to him.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.105
- Totally, totally "Scarlet."

10:38.138 --> 10:41.875
- Okay, and Kat,
you should come too.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.813
- I'd like that.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.382
- You wanted to
see me, Jacqueline?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.118
- Yes, you looked
terrified this morning.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.787
- No.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.756
- You look terrified now.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.891
Does writing the sex column
make you uncomfortable?

10:57.925 --> 11:01.995
- No, I, um--I'm
a little uncomfortable,

11:02.029 --> 11:05.132
but I'm very excited to be
a part of this writing staff

11:05.165 --> 11:08.736
and to stretch myself
as a writer.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.773
- Okay, well, I guess
we are done here then.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.141
[papers rustle]
- That's it?

11:14.174 --> 11:16.076
- Well, I'm good if you're good.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.712
Are you good?

11:20.948 --> 11:23.083
- There's just...

11:23.116 --> 11:26.053
a lot of pressure here,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.221
and I don't want
to disappoint you.

11:28.255 --> 11:32.893
I want to live up to your
expectations sexually and--

11:32.926 --> 11:34.161
You know what I mean.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.763
- You just have to make
the article

11:35.796 --> 11:37.064
your own, Jane.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.899
You can't try to do
what Sage does.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.901
Very people can do
what Sage does.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.936
You've got to make it
personal.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.178
- Mr. Grey will see you now.
- That's not funny.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.113
- It sort of is,
and if we weren't

11:53.146 --> 11:55.182
in a glass conference room--
- But we are in a glass

11:55.215 --> 11:56.950
conference room right now,
so this is what's gonna happen.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.251
I'm gonna pass you my resume,

11:58.285 --> 11:59.920
and while you pretend
to look at it,

11:59.953 --> 12:02.923
we're gonna talk about
how completely my 76ers

12:02.956 --> 12:03.991
destroyed your Knicks
last night.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.894
- Well, that's just hurtful.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.797
You know, why can't we have an
actual informational interview?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.298
- Because this is awkward
for me.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.834
Look, we're in a good place.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.837
Outside of work
we're having fun.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.873
- It feels good.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.811
- It is...good.

12:23.844 --> 12:27.815
[soft music]

12:27.848 --> 12:30.884
- Well, I know that you're
feeling stuck on Lauren's desk,

12:30.918 --> 12:33.520
and holy--uh--
[clears throat]

12:33.553 --> 12:35.488
Sutton, this is a heck of
a resume you got here.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.858
- [giggles]
- Summa cum laude.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.928
Wow, and why Penn State?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.930
- I could save money
living at home.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.898
- And it says here that you
did an internship in finance.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.499
Why finance?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.969
- This is starting to feel
suspiciously like

12:49.002 --> 12:50.838
an informational interview.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.305
- Humor me.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.843
- Okay.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.845
Look, it's not
like I love finance.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.048
- Mm, probably don't say that in
a real informational interview.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.852
- My mother is complicated.
I had to be the adult.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.854
It made more sense for me
to do something practical.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.222
- And you didn't want to pursue
finance after graduation?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.892
- Oh, you mean when I graduated
into the worst job market

13:11.925 --> 13:15.162
in 50 years,
thanks to your generation?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.964
- Mm.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.367
- I couldn't get a fulltime job,
so I started to temp.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.970
That's how I wound up
at "Scarlet."

13:23.003 --> 13:24.304
- But you stayed.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.606
- Longer than I intended to.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.210
I just--I love this magazine,

13:30.243 --> 13:33.981
and I would like to stay here,
but...

13:34.014 --> 13:36.884
I need to start thinking
seriously about moving on.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.159

there's an opening in ad sales.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.162
Give him a call, 'cause I think
you'd be perfect for it.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.008
- Hello?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.911
Yes, Dr. Morris, thank you
so much for getting back to me.

14:03.944 --> 14:07.014
Um, hold on.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.885
So I saw you
a few months ago

14:11.919 --> 14:14.922
for a pap smear,
and I just wanted to--

14:14.955 --> 14:16.656
- Oh, that looks good.
- Um...

14:16.689 --> 14:18.658
- That one's hot for summer.
- Hold one second.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.129
Um, I swear this is important.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.630
I don't mean to waste your time.

14:23.663 --> 14:27.935
I just, um--
Hold on a second.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.303
The issue I'm having is, um,

14:30.337 --> 14:33.173
I've never actually
climaxed before,

14:33.206 --> 14:36.676
and I'm just wondering
if there could be

14:36.709 --> 14:38.645
a problem with my--

14:39.947 --> 14:42.249
Hello?

14:42.282 --> 14:44.952
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.954
Can you hear me?

14:46.987 --> 14:49.089
Yeah, no, no, no,
I'm--I'm in an elevator.

14:49.122 --> 14:53.961
No, I--I said a problem.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.963
No, a problem?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.297
[elevator bell dings]
[whispers] Oh, my God.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.332

15:04.004 --> 15:06.039
- And I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.276
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.112
- You're the new
"Scarlet" writer, right?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.114
- Yup, Jane, hi.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.117
- Did you write about getting
dumped in a train station?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.086
Oof!

15:19.119 --> 15:21.088
It was very cute.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.389
- [scoffs]

- I'm Ry--
- Ryan from "Pinstripe."

15:25.225 --> 15:26.659
Yeah, I know who you are.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.495
You wrote the article about

15:28.528 --> 15:31.731
getting your girlfriend
to screw like a porn star.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.501
- Yes.
- Also very cute.

working on now?

meeting you, Jane.

You looking for Lauren?
- Kat, actually.

16:03.363 --> 16:07.000
I got a message she wants me
to do an interview with Adena.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.336
- Hmm. Do I look
like Kat's assistant?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.004
- No,
but you look like someone

16:11.038 --> 16:13.540
who knows
where Kat is at all times.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.077
- She's with Jane at the--she's
helping Jane with her article.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.647
- Thank you. What's that?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.216
- Uh, nothing,
or maybe something.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.785
I don't know.
There's an ad sales job

16:25.818 --> 16:28.221

about going for.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.790
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.259
Why? Is that bad?
- I just didn't realize

16:32.292 --> 16:34.527
that's something
you wanted to do.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.529
- I mean, ad sales
isn't really my dream job,

16:36.563 --> 16:38.265
but look at this
compensation package.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.366
[whistles]

16:39.399 --> 16:41.268
- That's some good money.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.536
- Yeah, life-changing money
for me.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.638
Is that a bad reason
to take a job?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.374
- That's exactly why
you take the job.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.609
- Right? And it could be fun.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.079
I would be selling ad space
in a magazine that I love.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.181
I'm good with people.
I could be good at this.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.348
- Yeah, you're amazing.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.384
you'd be great at it.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.686

Yeah.

some Shake Shack.

- Come in. Get comfortable.

This is your girlfriend?

17:17.337 --> 17:19.839
- No, no, we're just friends.
- I'm her moral support.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.575
- Yeah, we're both straight.
- Oh, but actually, you know,

17:22.609 --> 17:24.311
since we're here,

17:24.344 --> 17:25.845
I am having
some sexual identity issues.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.847
- Kat.
- I've always been into dudes,

17:27.880 --> 17:31.584
but then I met this girl,
and she's awesome.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.253
and I just saw her for the first
time in a while--

17:33.286 --> 17:35.422
- Okay, well, and we will
get back to that...

17:35.455 --> 17:37.724
[laughs]
because...

17:37.757 --> 17:39.792
Wow! Um...

17:39.826 --> 17:41.628
But...
- Yes.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.729
- This brings us to my problem.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.597
I've never had an orgasm before,

17:44.631 --> 17:45.865
and my gynecologist says

17:45.898 --> 17:47.434
that there's
no real medical issue,

17:47.467 --> 17:50.437
so...here we are.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.842
What exactly
does a sexologist do?

17:55.875 --> 17:58.278
- Well, I'm gonna give you
some physical exercises

17:58.311 --> 17:59.779
and assignments.
- I'm into this.

17:59.812 --> 18:00.880
- Of course you are.
- Let's start here.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.883
Ever heard of a yoni egg?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.618
- Yes.
- This will help strengthen

18:05.652 --> 18:07.620
the vaginal muscles
and increase sensitivity.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.422
- These were all
over Gwyneth's blog.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.424
- Yeah, but there were, like,
a million takedown pieces.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.261
This is, like, an infection
waiting to happen.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.396
- Not if you use the right ones
and in the right way.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.365
- I don't really feel
comfortable

18:18.398 --> 18:22.769
putting a yoni in...
my yoni.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.371
- Which is exactly why
I want you to.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.872
- So crazy how they--
- Don't touch it!

18:25.905 --> 18:28.141
- Could you please tell her

18:28.175 --> 18:29.376
to stop being so uptight?
- There's absolutely

18:29.409 --> 18:31.144
nothing wrong
with being uptight.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.645
- Thank you.
- The problem is when you

18:32.679 --> 18:34.914
let it hold you back.
Jane, if you want to

18:34.947 --> 18:39.152
have an orgasm, you have to
find your inner freak.

- She did not seriously tell you
to watch porn as an assignment?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.930
- She wants Jane to find
a fantasy

18:50.963 --> 18:53.666
so she can awaken
her erotic creature.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.337
- Okay, you know what? My erotic

18:57.370 --> 18:59.439
- Then tell me one fantasy
you have.

- Okay, sorry, there's no way
this woman is enjoying this.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.244
- No.
- Could somebody please

19:04.277 --> 19:05.512
make her stop moaning?
- Yeah, I want to pick one.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.447
- Honestly,
it's the production value

19:07.480 --> 19:09.716
of half of this stuff
that turns me off, you know?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.418

any day of the week.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.396
- You know, it's not like
I don't have fantasies.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.298
I do.
- Okay.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.533
- I just...

19:26.566 --> 19:28.735
I wind up getting too logical.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.937
Like, okay,
so there's this one--

19:30.970 --> 19:34.974
- Ooh.
- Where I'm in a cotton field,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.244
and this really hot soldier,

19:37.277 --> 19:39.412
and he, like,
rips off my corset,

19:39.446 --> 19:42.215
and...then I'm like,

19:42.249 --> 19:43.883
"Well, if I'm Scarlett O'Hara,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.985
"then that means that
he's a Confederate soldier,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.955
and then that means that I'm on
the wrong end of the Civil War."

19:48.988 --> 19:52.459
- Oh, babe, I appreciate you not
being racist in your fantasy,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.527
but it's just a fantasy.
That's the whole point.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.763
You're supposed to just
totally give in to whatever.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.566
- Yeah, well, I'm not
a "totally give in to whatever"

19:59.599 --> 20:01.434
type of person.
I wish I was.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.470
- What should we
watch next?

20:03.503 --> 20:05.004
- So...
- What is the...[murmurs]?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.473
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.740
- Amateur?
- Mm-mm.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.476
- I have
a job interview tomorrow.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.877
- What?
- Oh, my God!

20:10.910 --> 20:12.345
- That's amazing. For what?

20:12.379 --> 20:14.447
- In ad sales.
- Ad sales?

20:14.481 --> 20:15.782
- Yeah, it kind of
came out of nowhere,

20:15.815 --> 20:17.484
but I'm really excited about it.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.352
I feel like I'm kind
of perfect for it.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.887
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.323
- But why wouldn't you
go out for something

20:23.356 --> 20:25.358
in the fashion department?
- No way.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.560
I mean, even if
I could get a foot in the door,

20:27.594 --> 20:30.029
there's no money in it
unless you really make it,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.765
which, I mean, the odds of that
happening are basically zero.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.536
- Well, yeah, but ad sales?
God, it sounds so boring.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.473
Okay, uh, this right here.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.510
Every time I think about Adena,
my mind eventually goes to this,

20:43.543 --> 20:46.813
and I'm just like, "Nope."

20:47.947 --> 20:50.417
- Really? Ad sales
is kind of boring?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.051
I mean, I'm just talking about

20:52.084 --> 20:53.786
changing the course
of my entire future,

20:53.820 --> 20:55.822
and that's all you have to say?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.492
- No, I mean,
it is though, isn't it?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.494
- It's a good job.
- You guys.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.929
- Yeah, but Sutton,
is that really what you

21:02.962 --> 21:04.497
want to do
with the rest of your life?

21:04.531 --> 21:06.399
- I need a job, Kat, a real job,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.535
not an assistant job
that doesn't pay anything.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.936
All right, I'm gonna go.
- What? No.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.438
Where are you going?
- Don't go.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.072
- I have an interview tomorrow.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.974
I can't stay up all night
watching porn!

21:15.007 --> 21:16.543
- We could shut it off.
I would be more than happy to.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.511
- That's fine.
I'm going to sleep at Richard's.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.547
You guys suck.
- I messed that up, didn't I?

21:20.580 --> 21:22.915
- Yeah, good job.
Shut this off.

21:31.891 --> 21:32.992
- Hey.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.562
- Hi.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.564
- Can't sleep?

21:37.597 --> 21:39.532
- I snapped
at my friends tonight.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.968
- No, you're just nervous
about your interview.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.404
- Yeah.
I just feel like they don't know

21:44.437 --> 21:47.574
what this could mean for me...

21:47.607 --> 21:49.409
Kat especially.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.344
She's never had
to worry about money.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.979
She doesn't have student loans

21:53.012 --> 21:54.581
and a mom
who can't pay her own bills.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.849
This job would literally
change my life.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.519
- Yeah, it's a big deal.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.391
- Can I tell you something

22:04.424 --> 22:06.859
that's probably gonna
sound insane to you?

22:06.893 --> 22:08.495
- Tell me.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.031
- Before I moved here,
I took a $100 bill,

22:12.064 --> 22:13.900
and I put it into an envelope.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.004
I carry that envelope with me.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.007
It's in my purse right now.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.377
- Okay, why?

22:24.411 --> 22:26.913
- Uh...

22:26.946 --> 22:28.681
it's my plan B.

22:28.715 --> 22:32.485
It's just enough money to buy
a train ticket home if I fail.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.587
- Sutton, you're not
going back to Harrisburg.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.523
- I don't know.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.492
It's been four years carrying
around that emergency envelope.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.060
It used to make me feel safe,

22:41.093 --> 22:43.530
and now it's this
horrible weight.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.170
First thing I'm gonna do
if I get that job,

22:51.203 --> 22:52.905
spend that $100 bill.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.373
- Damn right you will.

- It wasn't you. It was me.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.727
Do you?
[phone buzzes]

24:55.762 --> 24:58.631
- Oh, why is she
calling me again?

24:58.665 --> 25:01.568
Uh, yeah, I do,

25:01.601 --> 25:03.269
and for what it's worth,
I'm really sorry

25:03.302 --> 25:06.673
that I didn't take the Adena
thing seriously last night.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.274
Is this real?

25:08.307 --> 25:10.176
- I don't know.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.245
I definitely
feel something for her,

25:13.279 --> 25:17.216
but then I think
about all the sex stuff

25:17.249 --> 25:19.719
and what that would mean,
and...

25:19.752 --> 25:22.254
my shrink parents
would probably say

25:22.288 --> 25:25.091
it's because she was
unreachable for so long,

25:25.124 --> 25:27.093
I probably confused my concern

25:27.126 --> 25:28.595
for romantic feelings
or something.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.062
- Is that really what
they would say?

25:30.096 --> 25:32.699
- Oh, yeah.
[phone chiming]

25:32.732 --> 25:34.634
All right, Jane.
Hey, can I call you back?

25:34.667 --> 25:38.104
- Don't hang up.
The yoni egg, I tried it.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.572
- Ooh, hey, good for you, babe.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.140
How's your yoni?
Oh, Sutton and I--

25:41.173 --> 25:43.242
- It's stuck.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.044

Oh, come on.
- Good morning.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.288
Do you need me
to press the button for you?

25:56.322 --> 25:58.324
- No, I got it.

- You seem a little tense.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.363
- You know what?
I lied yesterday.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.132
Your article wasn't cute.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.834
- Ouch.
- The way you write about sex,

26:07.867 --> 26:10.136
you put these unrealistic
expectations on women,

26:10.169 --> 26:11.303
so then of course
we feel like failures

26:11.337 --> 26:13.039
if we can't--

26:15.307 --> 26:17.143
You know what?
Just for once I would like

26:17.176 --> 26:19.145
to see you actually talk
about a woman's needs in bed,

26:19.178 --> 26:20.647
maybe giving your readers
a little advice

26:20.680 --> 26:23.149
on how they could do that?

26:23.182 --> 26:25.618
What? Why are you smiling?

my articles at all.

who speaks her mind.

both: Not it!
- No, I said it first.

- Congratulations. So what?

26:45.104 --> 26:46.773
- I can't have my hand
up there an hour before

I'm supposed to shake it
with the entire ad sales team.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.377
You're the one who wants
to explore her sexuality.

- Oh, my God, seriously?

what helps me to relax

27:34.320 --> 27:35.855
is you telling me to relax.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.256

29:55.494 --> 29:57.396
- Jacqueline?
- Yeah?

29:57.429 --> 30:00.232
- Sorry to interrupt.
I have my article for you.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.334
- Oh, great.
How did it turn out?

30:02.368 --> 30:05.304
- Uh, well, it's--
[clears throat] You'll see.

30:05.337 --> 30:08.507
Uh, but before I give it to you,
I just wanted to ask.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.378
I know you don't normally
let writers publish anonymously,

30:12.411 --> 30:15.214
but I was hoping you could make
an exception just this once.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.949
- Do you know why I don't like
to publish pieces

30:16.983 --> 30:18.550
without real names?

30:18.584 --> 30:20.486
- You want our readers to feel
like they can trust us.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.890
- Exactly. I want them to know
that we are real women

30:23.923 --> 30:27.927
just going through the same
things they're going through.

30:27.960 --> 30:32.131
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Uh...

30:32.164 --> 30:33.866
I'll just hand it over.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.240
- Oh. Never?

30:41.273 --> 30:43.275
Hmm.
I'll give it a read.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.278
[singing pop melody]
in foreign language]

30:46.312 --> 30:53.619
*

31:06.298 --> 31:08.567
- What? Oh, my God.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.302
Did you know
she was gonna use this?

31:10.336 --> 31:12.204
- You look great.
- I did not know.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.273
- Whoa! You look gorgeous.
- Wow.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.645
- I understand you.
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.447
[laughs]

31:21.480 --> 31:23.882
[cheers and applause]

31:31.357 --> 31:34.226
- Do you...
want to introduce me?

31:34.260 --> 31:36.295
- What?
Yes, yeah.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.898
I--I just feel like we should
give her a minute, so...

31:45.972 --> 31:49.675
- Seriously? What, is he, like,
following me now?

31:49.708 --> 31:52.211
- Ryan from "Pinstripe"?

31:52.244 --> 31:53.545
He's reviewing the show.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.514
- Oh, great,
just what the world needs,

31:55.547 --> 31:58.951
an interpretation of feminist
art through the male gaze.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.287
- Well, he's actually
a pretty good writer.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.295
- I need a drink.
- Did you say drink?

32:09.328 --> 32:11.297
- Yup.
- Mm, you know what?

32:11.330 --> 32:12.498
This is a work call,
so I'm just gonna--

32:12.531 --> 32:13.932
- Yeah, yeah.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.568
- Hi.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.570
- I just got an email.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.439
- That's exciting.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.575
- It's asking my approval
to send out an offer letter,

32:23.609 --> 32:25.711
and I'm violating
like three different

32:25.744 --> 32:28.047
confidentiality clauses
by telling you this,

32:28.080 --> 32:30.416
but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.651
You're getting the job.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.287
- Wow.
- You must have dazzled them

32:35.321 --> 32:36.555
in the interview today.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.392
Good night, Sutton.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.338
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.674
Um, I'm...kind of in shock.
[laughs]

32:57.409 --> 33:00.479
I got the job.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.682
- Hey, congratulations.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.418
Okay, I thought this was
supposed to be a good thing.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.421
- Yeah, it is good.
It's great.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.590
- But?
- I don't know.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.092
I should be ecstatic.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.527
The money is incredible,
but--

33:17.563 --> 33:19.365
But nothing.
It's amazing.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.133
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.369
- Okay, forget the money.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.672
What's your dream?

33:26.705 --> 33:29.641
- Fashion.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.043
I've always loved it,

33:31.077 --> 33:33.679
but it's too risky, you know?

33:33.712 --> 33:36.748
I can't afford to fail,

33:36.782 --> 33:42.388
and there are practicalities
that I--I need to consider.

33:42.421 --> 33:47.059
- I get it, but you get
to have a dream too, Sutton.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.762
- * Do you break it off
when it hurts *

33:50.796 --> 33:54.566
* But it hurts so good,
can you say it *

33:54.600 --> 33:56.768
* Can you say it,
it hurts so good *

33:56.802 --> 33:58.737
- Hello?
- Jane, hi.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.740
Um, so I--I read your article.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.142
I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.077
I need you to take another pass.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.845
- Do you have
any specific notes?

34:06.878 --> 34:08.714
- Uh, yeah.
You're holding back.

34:08.747 --> 34:12.084
All I see are facts and figures,
and where are you?

34:12.118 --> 34:14.353
- I'm--I'm at an art gallery.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.355
Do you need me to come back?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.357
- No, I mean where are you
in this piece?

34:18.390 --> 34:21.193
- I...I don't know.

34:21.227 --> 34:25.364
- I don't want percentages.
I want your point of view.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.833
- Those percentages
aren't boring to me.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.768
I mean, 10% of women say

34:29.801 --> 34:31.637
they've never had
an orgasm before,

34:31.670 --> 34:35.207
and researchers say
that number's probably higher.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.110
But...no one will admit it,

34:38.144 --> 34:40.212
and, you know,

34:40.246 --> 34:43.215
knowing that I'm not
the only one--

34:43.249 --> 34:45.651
it's comforting.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.827
- Jane?

34:57.696 --> 35:00.532
- Look,
it's amazing that women

35:00.566 --> 35:02.834
are owning their sexualities
in this way

35:02.868 --> 35:05.671
that they've never
been able to before, but...

35:05.704 --> 35:07.239
[sighs]

35:07.273 --> 35:11.410
for someone like me,
it's a lot of pressure

35:11.443 --> 35:13.445
to live up to,
and even this magazine

35:13.479 --> 35:15.214
makes me feel bad
about it sometimes.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.851
I'm sorry.
I--I didn't mean that.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.192
- I'm gonna do something.

35:27.593 --> 35:31.563
I am gonna let you write
this article anonymously,

35:31.597 --> 35:35.167
but in return I want
the real story

35:35.201 --> 35:37.436
from your heart, not your head.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.271
I want to know what this
is really like for you.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.440
- Okay.

35:41.473 --> 35:45.644
- I'll expect the next draft
on my desk tomorrow.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.813
- G'night.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.619
- Don't touch the art,
please.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.491
[background chatter]

36:01.760 --> 36:03.495
- Hey. I think I got to go.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.697
- Oh.
- Have you said hi to Adena yet?

36:05.731 --> 36:07.499
- Uh, nope.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.269
- So why do you think that is?

36:10.302 --> 36:13.739
- Mm, gay, straight,
I don't--I don't know.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.209
I--I don't think it matters,

36:17.243 --> 36:19.278
so I...

36:19.311 --> 36:21.247
I'm just gonna
go talk to her.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.217
- Go talk to her.
- Okay.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.286
- * Wide awake
through the daylight *

36:27.319 --> 36:30.222
- Get it, girl.
- * Will you hold me

36:30.256 --> 36:34.293
* Like we're burning
in paradise *

36:36.027 --> 36:37.929
* When it hurts

36:37.963 --> 36:41.967
* But it hurts so good,
do you take it *

36:42.000 --> 36:45.537
* Do you break it off
when it hurts *

36:45.571 --> 36:51.009
* Hurts so good

36:51.042 --> 36:52.978
- Kat, hey.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.880
Are you okay?

36:54.913 --> 36:56.748
- God, I feel like
such an idiot.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.950
I just completely misread
that whole situation.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.253
- Hey, you're not an idiot.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.956
- No, you're not. I mean, you're
the bravest person I know.

37:04.990 --> 37:08.894
You take risks,
and you put yourself out there.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.964
I mean, I wish
I could be more like you.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.967
- Yeah, me too.

37:16.001 --> 37:20.706
- Like I said, you got
to do something crazy.

37:20.739 --> 37:25.010
- You know what?
I can, and I will.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.320
Hey.
- Hey.

37:34.353 --> 37:37.022
- So have you been
flirting with me?

37:37.055 --> 37:38.924
- Yeah.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.860
- * 'Cause all of the downs
and the uppers *

37:41.893 --> 37:44.330
* Keep making love
to each other *

37:44.363 --> 37:47.666
* And I'm trying, trying,
trying, trying *

37:47.699 --> 37:49.935
* Can't keep my hands
to myself *

37:49.968 --> 37:51.069
*

37:51.102 --> 37:52.671
* Can't keep my hands...

37:52.704 --> 37:55.841
- I have to go.
I have to write.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.676
- Jane.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.945
- * And nothing else

37:59.978 --> 38:03.014
* Oh, I want it all

38:03.048 --> 38:04.983
- Hey.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.585
- Hello.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.320
- I've been waiting
for the right moment

38:08.354 --> 38:09.955
to come talk to you.

38:09.988 --> 38:13.725
- I know. It's been, um,
a very busy night,

38:13.759 --> 38:15.627
but I'm so happy you came.

38:15.661 --> 38:19.331
- Yeah, me too, and I wanted
to talk to you about something.

38:19.365 --> 38:22.100
I'm--I'm kind of nervous
to say it.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.337
- The photograph? I know.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.938
I should have
asked your permission.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.107
- No, no, no.
Honestly, it's so fine.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.577
I'm actually kind of honored.

38:31.610 --> 38:35.113
What I was thinking of was...

38:35.146 --> 38:40.886
just how incredible
this show is.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.688
It's amazing.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.858
- Thank you.

38:46.892 --> 38:52.097
*

38:52.130 --> 38:54.032
- I'm getting a drink. You?

38:54.065 --> 38:56.668
- Definitely.
- Excuse me, can we

38:56.702 --> 38:58.136
please see
the champagne menu?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.906
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

39:00.939 --> 39:04.876
We'll take a bottle of the Veuve
Clicquot Yellow Label.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.012
- Sure.
- That's an expensive bottle.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.013
- Mm-hmm.
- I take it we're celebrating.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.081
- Yup.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.950
- Here you go.

39:11.983 --> 39:12.984
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.821
- To your new job.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.055
- I'm not taking the job.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.791
- Then what are we celebrating?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.029
- Crazy dreams.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.031
- * I want it all

39:26.064 --> 39:28.900
*

39:28.934 --> 39:31.637
* I want it all

39:31.670 --> 39:33.805
* Ooh ooh

39:33.839 --> 39:36.007
*

39:36.041 --> 39:38.777
* Can't keep my hands
to myself *

39:38.810 --> 39:41.413
* I mean, I could,
but why would I want to? *

39:41.447 --> 39:48.854
*

39:48.887 --> 39:52.023
- It's honest and funny
and brave.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.927
I want to put it up
on our digital site right now.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.396
- Okay.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.067
Uh, wait.

40:03.101 --> 40:07.105
Can I just make
one change first?

40:07.138 --> 40:08.474
- Sure.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.990
You ready?

40:25.023 --> 40:27.025
- Yeah.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.127
*

40:29.160 --> 40:31.997
- * Why you hanging
in the background *

40:32.030 --> 40:34.099
* Like a painting
that's been turned 'round *

40:34.132 --> 40:36.868
* Come on, come on,
come on, come on *

40:36.902 --> 40:39.204
* Come on, come on, come on,
come on *

40:39.237 --> 40:44.009
* It's your time now

40:44.042 --> 40:45.877
* Can you feel it now

40:45.911 --> 40:48.514
* You got the heart
of a phoenix *

40:48.547 --> 40:53.118
* So let them see you rise

40:53.151 --> 40:55.521
* Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

40:55.554 --> 40:58.089
* Let's see you show
how high you can go *

40:58.123 --> 41:00.859
* Flying right past
the ones who said no *

41:00.892 --> 41:04.129
* Let's give them all
one hell of a show *

41:04.162 --> 41:06.164
* Hey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey

41:06.197 --> 41:09.100
* You got the heart,
you got the heart *

41:09.134 --> 41:11.903
* You got the heart of a
heart of a, hey *

41:11.937 --> 41:13.939
* You got the heart,
the heart *

41:13.972 --> 41:15.841
* You got the heart,
the heart of a *
