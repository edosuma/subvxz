00:08.200 --> 00:10.799
Three, two, one.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.839
Get it! Come on!
Come on, here we go!

00:13.920 --> 00:15.639
Yes, come on!

00:15.720 --> 00:17.759
Congratulations!

00:17.840 --> 00:19.439
Oh, my gosh!

00:21.560 --> 00:24.479
All right! Congratulations,
ma'am.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.479
You are going
to San Francisco!

00:30.160 --> 00:31.719
Hello?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.559
Who?

00:34.760 --> 00:36.839
It's Grace Kaukonen for you?

00:36.920 --> 00:38.159
Who?

00:38.240 --> 00:40.599
She sounds British.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.639
Hello?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.399
Yeah, I see.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.319
Yeah, no problem. I'll...

00:53.840 --> 00:55.599
Yeah, I'll be right there.

00:56.560 --> 01:00.159
You gotta go now?
It's 9.30.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.159
That's what 24 hours means,
honey.

01:03.240 --> 01:07.479
Waste pipe broke.
They got sewage spilling into the rec room.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.399
... running toward
the ball, he grabs, reaching out...

02:46.480 --> 02:50.559
... he makes a backhanded catch
and then slams against the fencing...

02:50.640 --> 02:53.999
... spinning away from the wall
in the end after a fabulous catch...

02:54.080 --> 02:58.319
... retiring fades
and ending the night for the poor Sox.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.999
No!

03:41.560 --> 03:44.839
- No!
- Danny? Leanne!

04:20.320 --> 04:21.919
- Panj familii.
- Anton?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.239
Janus.
You're all going to die.

04:25.320 --> 04:29.599
I want to help you, and I believe this is right.
It's just I... I don't think I can.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.759
Do you think
I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit?

04:31.840 --> 04:33.159
Well, I'm alive.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.879
I have Christian Donaldson.
But I want Amanda and Tess safe.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.559
- Jessica's gone.
- What?

04:41.640 --> 04:43.119
Philip?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.559
Philip Carvel?

04:45.640 --> 04:48.239
- Philip Carvel's alive.
- Philip's alive?

04:49.440 --> 04:50.799
We need to talk.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.399
... to test a nuclear device
on the Kazakh border.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.919
Now China is claiming that this was
previously a nuclear testing site..

05:25.000 --> 05:29.079
.... but there is little doubt that this is
Beijing drawing a line in the sand.

05:29.160 --> 05:32.919
- We await a response...
- You want to speak to me?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.119
You have something to tell...

05:55.040 --> 05:57.599
Fucking... fuck!

06:04.920 --> 06:07.439
How long
have I been asleep?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.159
Two days, straight through.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.599
Can I have some food,
please?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.999
Remember this?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.399
- Philip?
- Jesus, don't call him Philip.

06:58.480 --> 07:03.279
Why not? Pietre and Donaldson are out
and Grant's in his own world.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.839
We've been here for two days.
Why the hell are we doing nothing?

07:05.920 --> 07:08.159
- And what is it you wanna do?
- Look.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.599
He saw a news story and said,
"Janus, you're all gonna die."

07:10.680 --> 07:15.479
It was USNC News, an American network,
which means we can't get it online.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.519
- So we need to break into their offices.
- What?

07:18.600 --> 07:21.279
We need to steal it and show it to Anton,
then we go and talk to Dugdale.

07:21.360 --> 07:26.359
Break in? What are you on?
And fucking Dugdale's with them.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.839
- I don't believe he is.
- And your judgment's so great.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.479
What does that mean?

07:31.560 --> 07:34.839
No, no, come on.
Let's have it out.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.519
- You called Milner.
- Oh, here we go.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.079
After everyone saying, "Don't call Milner,
don't call Milner," you called Milner.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.119
- It was a mistake.
- Was it? Was it, Ian?

07:45.200 --> 07:47.999
Are you that fucking stupid?

07:48.080 --> 07:52.239
Or... are you actually
quite fucking smart?

07:52.320 --> 07:54.879
Your insults are getting increasingly cryptic.
What the hell are you saying?

07:54.960 --> 07:57.999
Maybe you're doing stupid stuff
cos you want it more dangerous.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.039
Oh, for Christ's sake, Becky!

07:59.120 --> 08:00.959
- You're getting off on it.
- This is fucking psychobabble.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.599
It's not IT any more,
is it, Ian?

08:03.680 --> 08:06.479
Getting a buzz, are you?
Nice little danger bone.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.479
Gonna nip off
for a little five-finger froufrou?

08:08.560 --> 08:09.799
And you're obsessed with wanking.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.399
Well, let's face it, you're not into me
any more, are you?

08:11.480 --> 08:13.359
No. No, I am not.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.359
Right. Can I ask why?

08:20.440 --> 08:22.679
Ask your pal.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.519
Donaldson.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.279
Fuck's sake!
Why's Anton drawing on my Utopia?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.919
It's time you knew something.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.839
But you can't tell
anyone this, Grant, all right?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.279
Anton is Philip Carvel.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.679
Nah.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.759
What, Anton? Mad Anton?

08:48.840 --> 08:50.759
Do you remember anything else
about that story?

08:50.840 --> 08:53.199
Are you sure it wasn't...
it wasn't about the vaccine or V Day?

08:53.280 --> 08:55.559
Nah, it was just about a cat
on a fucking Hoover.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.919
Anton went nuts.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.439
Right, I'm going.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.359
Fuck this.
I can't just sit here.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.999
China is the largest consumer
of wheat in the world.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.639
Its harvest is fading.
It's not just gonna roll over.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.399
Yes, but it cannot be allowed
to flaunt international law.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.319
America's right. It should be closed
now it's a peak market...

09:28.960 --> 09:30.319
These are nice.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.599
- Did you use salt?
- Er... yeah, but just a pinch.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.519
It's nice.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.719
Tasty. Do you do that
while you're cooking them, or after?

09:38.800 --> 09:43.359
Er... after.
Otherwise you... you lose flavour.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.919
Actually...

09:45.480 --> 09:50.639
... do you mind if we talk about you
breaking in with a knife...

09:50.720 --> 09:52.879
... and not my eggs?

09:53.480 --> 09:56.079
So you're in charge
of the vaccine, Michael?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.559
Look, look,
I... I know how this looks.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.319
But I thought all... all this,
er... Janus stuff was over.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.599
And Geoff said
we had to keep making the vaccine.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.719
You know, all the fuss last year.
He couldn't just stop...

10:08.800 --> 10:12.079
Well, he... well, he paid me!

10:13.120 --> 10:14.719
Money!

10:17.360 --> 10:19.879
Jessica, I am not with them.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.879
Michael, don't worry.

10:21.960 --> 10:25.759
If I thought you were with them,
you'd be dead.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.759
I know who Mr. Rabbit is.

10:31.600 --> 10:36.039
- Mr. Rabbit's dead. Grant killed him.
- Mr. Rabbit's alive.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.839
I won't tell you who.

10:37.920 --> 10:42.119
I've put you in enough danger,
and you've been really kind to me.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.719
I'm sorry your wife left you.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.079
And you must miss Alice.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.639
Look, I'll stay a day or two.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.079
I'm trying to find Ian.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.799
Well, there was something
between him and me, you know?

11:09.880 --> 11:12.519
Oh, right.
Because I thought, er... Becky...

11:12.600 --> 11:14.199
Yeah.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.719
I like Becky.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.519
She's not for him, though.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.279
Can I ask
what we're doing here?

12:04.360 --> 12:06.039
Excuse me.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.079
Why... why am I here?

12:08.920 --> 12:11.919
Oh, nice. Live feed.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.559
Where is that? Greece?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.159
Albania?

12:19.240 --> 12:23.839
- Am I getting a new identity too?
- Yeah. Albania, I reckon.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.079
No CCTV.
Cash-based culture.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.079
Yeah.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.759
Albania's where I'd go
if I was retiring.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.119
So, erm...
what the fuck's going on?

12:38.320 --> 12:40.279
Arby's saving his family.

12:41.600 --> 12:46.879
- Oh, I... I didn't see you as a family man.
- This is all about family.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.839
Oh, here we go.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.359
See?
Tess and Amanda are safe.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.679
- Hello?
- Tess? It's me, Pietre.

13:02.760 --> 13:04.279
Pietre, what's going on?

13:04.360 --> 13:08.399
- These men, they... they just took us.
- Tess, please, you have to listen.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.839
I need you both to look up to your right
and into the camera, now.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.479
Amanda, look over here,
please.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.959
That is the last time
you can ever do that.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.519
In the bag,
there are new identities.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.159
- But what... I...
- You can never go home.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.799
You can never use
bank accounts or e-mail.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.519
You can never contact
anyone you once knew.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.759
Go east.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.119
After half a mile
is a blue Toyota.

13:39.200 --> 13:44.199
Drive to the location on the map,
and start a new life.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.519
Are... are you coming too?

13:47.640 --> 13:52.359
- No. You will never see me again.
- But... Why?

13:52.440 --> 13:57.559
Can you both look into the camera
for one moment more, please?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.119
Thank you.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.319
Throw the phone away.

14:17.240 --> 14:20.359
Kept my side
of the bargain, matey.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.959
Ciao for now.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.559
What about the rest?
Things have changed, Arby.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.439
I can't really tell you why,
but we need them. All of them.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.199
Right now.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.079
It's very, very important.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.599
Where is Jessica Hyde?

15:18.040 --> 15:20.519
- Leah told me Philip Carvel's alive?
- Yes.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.919
After all these years.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.079
I can't tell you how that feels.
It feels...

15:27.280 --> 15:30.519
I have someone after him.
We're close. He'll be with us soon.

15:30.600 --> 15:34.039
And this adjustment, is it...?
He'll tell us what it is?

15:34.120 --> 15:35.879
Cos we're making it, Milner.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.039
We're making the vaccine with Janus in it.
If there's anything wrong...

15:39.120 --> 15:42.599
He put it inside Jessica,
Wilson.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.559
He would never harm her.
He loved her.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.639
And you're willing to gamble
everything on that love?

15:47.720 --> 15:50.239
Yes. Yes, of course I am.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.479
Don't you understand yet?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.119
I need you, Wilson. You.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.439
This whole thing comes down to the kind of
people we are. You, me, Philip.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.119
What are you saying? I don't get this.
I don't get what you're trying...

16:05.200 --> 16:08.879
To get the manuscript,
we killed eight children.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.159
We went into a school, shot them dead,
and blamed it on Grant.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.519
I made that choice, that plan.
What do you think of that?

16:19.760 --> 16:22.079
Why are you telling me this?

16:24.520 --> 16:27.279
There's someone
I need you to meet.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.759
Philip?

16:32.840 --> 16:34.359
Philip.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.039
Please.

16:38.520 --> 16:42.799
Look, we know you speak English,
so bloody speak it now!

16:42.880 --> 16:45.839
Why did they put
that number on his arm?

16:46.760 --> 16:51.119
The Network. They tattooed a number
on his arm. Why did they do that?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.799
Oh, my God.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.399
Anton.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.079
So, what,
Anton's Jewish, then?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.839
Well, I don't know.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.799
There were loads of people in the Holocaust.
He could be any one of them.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.039
Hold your hands out.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.959
Parbyndyn zayn rikht hant.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.479
Yiddish?

17:30.560 --> 17:33.799
- Ain't that a bit racist?
- No. Stupid.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.399
Okay.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.439
Not that one.

17:37.520 --> 17:41.359
Berühren Sie die rechte Hand.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.559
Okay.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.359
La mână dreapta.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.679
Fucking hell. You did it.

17:59.760 --> 18:03.439
It's Romanian.
He's speaking Romanian.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.959
Right, stay here.
I'll be back soon.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.159
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:00.240 --> 19:04.759
What the hell are you doing here?
This place is disgusting.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.879
Put your food
in the waste basket!

19:06.960 --> 19:08.719
We are not your servants.
We are human beings.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.879
Sorry, sorry.
I... I don't normally work here. I just...

19:43.560 --> 19:45.159
Dugdale?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.159
It's me!

19:50.240 --> 19:51.679
Ian.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.199
What the fuck?

20:04.440 --> 20:06.439
Have you been running?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.359
You're out of breath.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.359
Er... yeah, I was.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.119
Jessica, what are you doing?

20:21.000 --> 20:24.079
- No, no, hang on. Hang on. Wait.
- No, I'm not waiting.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.599
I'm not fucking waiting at all.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.919
2050. That's when fish stocks run out.
Do you fucking get that?

20:47.000 --> 20:51.279
- Course. It's...
- 2080, end of gas. 2090, end of oil.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.879
Those figures don't come from Greenpeace
or Friends of the fucking Earth.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.719
They come from BP.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.279
If demand for fertiliser
increases at current rates...

20:58.360 --> 21:01.399
... phosphates end this century,
and that means no food.

21:01.480 --> 21:05.159
- I know. You don't have to tell me.
- Do you? Because I don't think you do.

21:05.240 --> 21:10.119
If you really knew, you'd understand
that we have no choice.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.599
You're just like Philip.
You can't let go of morality.

21:13.680 --> 21:17.599
But what we must do
puts us beyond morality.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.999
What are we doing here?

21:26.520 --> 21:29.679
This is Paul.
What do you do, Paul?

21:29.760 --> 21:33.639
- I'm assistant manager at...
- Tell Wilson what you really do.

21:34.600 --> 21:40.599
Paul is one of three people trained
to do one very, very special thing.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.479
It's okay.
Tell him everything.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.679
If I am chosen,
I will receive a call.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.839
The moment I do,
I shall walk out of my life.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.319
I will go into hiding
until just nine days before V Day...

21:55.400 --> 21:59.519
... when I will go to a car park in Denham.
A car will be waiting.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.319
It has been adapted
to store a canister...

22:01.400 --> 22:03.959
... that will have been slowly coming down
in temperature for nearly 90 days.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.639
When I get there, what's inside
the canister will be thawed...

22:07.720 --> 22:09.159
... ready for release.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.159
Do you know what's inside?

22:11.240 --> 22:15.239
Yeah. Inside is an extremely deadly
variant of Russian influenza.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.839
I will take it to a crop-duster
at Denham airfield...

22:17.920 --> 22:22.359
... which I'll fly over a 35-square-mile area,
releasing the virus onto those below.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.719
I will repeat this
at four other as-of-yet...

22:25.800 --> 22:28.599
... undisclosed locations
all over the world.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.359
Does it bother you that we're going to
release a deadly virus?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.639
Well, we have a vaccine.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.839
Many will die before it works.
You will have killed them.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.719
- But I will have saved everyone.
- Are you worried about dying?

22:39.800 --> 22:44.959
- Chances are you will be infected.
- No, I'm not worried about dying at all.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.999
I'm going to save the world.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.639
You should see your face.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.279
You're worried
Becky'll find out?

23:23.040 --> 23:24.559
I won't tell.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.999
Why are you here, Jessica?

23:28.280 --> 23:30.759
- Is Dugdale with them?
- No.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.319
He's just doing
what he has to.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.639
And I came looking for you.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.279
Where did you get
the scars?

23:46.760 --> 23:47.999
I, erm...

23:49.440 --> 23:52.559
I should never have brought
the manuscript to Milner.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.599
Janus wasn't in Utopia.
It was in me.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.559
I was the first person
to get the vaccine.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.919
My own dad did that to me.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.319
Your dad?
You mean Philip Carvel?

24:07.400 --> 24:09.759
So you've nothing
to worry about, Ian.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.999
I'm sterile.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.319
Shall we do it again?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.079
What is wrong with you?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.159
Do you want some eggs?

24:25.240 --> 24:27.159
I'll make some eggs.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.199
Okay.
Car pick you up in five minutes.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.719
How many will die?

26:38.720 --> 26:41.999
Typically, mortality in a flu virus
comes in waves.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.839
We hope the vaccine
will kick in on the first wave...

26:43.920 --> 26:46.399
... and the virus
will be eradicated.

26:49.520 --> 26:54.039
First wave, 1,200, 1,500 people.

26:54.120 --> 26:56.999
If it goes into the second wave,
it will almost certainly be tens of thousands.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.279
God. Jesus Christ, Milner.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.879
But think what
we will have done, Wilson.

27:02.960 --> 27:07.239
- This can't be the only way.
- We've been planning this for 30 years.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.999
If there was another way,
we'd know.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.079
I've told you everything.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.399
You need to tell me
if you can live with this.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.719
Can you live with this?

27:21.440 --> 27:24.319
Wilson, can you live with...?

27:27.200 --> 27:29.599
I need you to say it.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.919
Yes.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.999
I can...

27:40.360 --> 27:42.119
... live with this.

27:51.280 --> 27:54.759
- Where did you get this man?
- Fuck's it got to do with you?

27:54.840 --> 27:58.199
- You're the translator. Translate.
- Grant.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.559
He's...our neighbour.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.559
- He's ill.
- Neighbour?

28:04.640 --> 28:07.559
Live next door
to your nice unfinished hotel?

28:07.640 --> 28:09.919
Why not call 999?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.919
We'll give you £500 cash.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.559
Pleased to meet you.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.719
My name is Marius.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.519
Let us begin.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.839
O del si lasho.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.999
That not Romanian.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.199
That Romani.

28:37.240 --> 28:41.759
Romani, language of the Roma people.
Gypsy people, yes?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.879
You racist bastards.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.559
You think all Roma is from Romania.
Is not. Roma many places.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.359
Bulgaria, Poland, Spain.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.639
Romani different language,
like Welsh to English.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.079
Do you speak fucking Welsh?

28:55.160 --> 28:57.959
- Yeah, I do, actually.
- Doesn't matter.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.079
- But...
- You still racist.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.519
... he was speaking Romanian.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.959
Vorbesti Romaneste?

29:12.040 --> 29:16.399
Da, eu vorbesc limba Română.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.039
This Roma is from Romania.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.919
Coincidence. You still racist.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.079
- What's going on?
- Becky found a way to speak to Anton...

29:31.160 --> 29:33.039
... through twat-face.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.199
Is twat-face me?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.759
Ian was here.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.399
What? Here?
What... what did he want?

29:54.480 --> 29:57.559
Who knows
what that boy wants?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.239
Are you okay, Jessica?

30:01.320 --> 30:03.119
It's Milner.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.759
Milner's Mr. Rabbit.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.439
I'm sorry.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.639
I can't bear everything
on my own.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.919
I need someone to trust.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.199
You okay? You seem odd.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.959
I'm not odd.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.799
Odd? No, I'm fine. Why?

30:48.800 --> 30:52.439
Well, you haven't busted my nuts
about bringing Marius here, for a start.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.679
Look, are we gonna do this?

30:58.240 --> 31:03.239
- This man is a survivor?
- Yes, he is. Ask him about it.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.759
- De unde ai luat asta?
- Am fost in Bełżec.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.599
Fuck.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.359
Bełżec concentration camp.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.679
Very bad for Roma people,
very bad.

31:14.760 --> 31:20.519
Familia mea, mama, fratii, verii -
toti omorati.

31:20.600 --> 31:25.959
Mother, father, brothers, cousins -
whole family, all killed.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.319
Jesus Christ.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.519
He always hear the hissing...

31:32.600 --> 31:34.759
... gas released.

31:34.840 --> 31:39.999
End of war, he break incinerator.
Sabotage, yes?

31:41.040 --> 31:45.399
So, they take out the bodies,
dump the bodies in the wood.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.959
He hide in bodies.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.359
Two days.
He five years old.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.759
Am crescut, am vrut să imi folosesc
mintea pentru face ca asa...

31:55.840 --> 31:56.879
Grow up...

31:56.960 --> 32:01.319
... want use mind,
make never happen again.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.839
- Jesus, who is this guy?
- Just carry on.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.919
But then he meet...
Mr. Rabbit?

32:13.480 --> 32:16.079
Is that right, Mr. Rabbit?

32:16.160 --> 32:18.319
- He say she was incredible.
- She?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.999
- Mr. Rabbit was a man.
- No.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.359
He was feminine.

32:24.920 --> 32:31.479
They work together, make a thing
that solve... all world's problems?

32:32.240 --> 32:34.599
Is it Janus?

32:34.680 --> 32:36.999
You made Janus?

32:38.480 --> 32:41.319
And does Janus work, Anton?

32:42.120 --> 32:45.639
- Yes, it will work perfectly.
- Fuck. He speaks English?

32:45.720 --> 32:48.479
But not in the way
she thinks.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.679
She said we couldn't choose.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.319
I made an adjustment.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.519
I...

32:56.600 --> 33:00.439
I wanted to help evolution,
you see.

33:03.840 --> 33:07.199
- I chose.
- You mean a race?

33:08.280 --> 33:11.279
- You chose a race?
- I did.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.359
Oh, God, I did.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.119
And which race
did you choose?

33:33.080 --> 33:35.999
You show him
cat dressed like shark?

33:36.080 --> 33:37.079
Panj familii!

33:37.160 --> 33:38.879
- What the fuck?
- Panj familii!

33:38.960 --> 33:41.199
- What does that mean, "panj familii"?
- I don't know.

33:41.280 --> 33:45.839
Familii means "families". Panj is Romani,
it means "five". Five families.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.239
- And what does "five families" mean?
- Why the fuck you ask me?

33:48.320 --> 33:49.839
- Look, that's where he freaked.
- Yeah?

33:49.920 --> 33:53.079
Look at the bottom.
Man kills his family, Hartwell, Georgia.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.759
Hang on.
There was a story like that here as well.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.079
A man killed his family
out of the blue.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.559
Five families.
So there's three more?

33:59.640 --> 34:02.959
Okay, you guys
are fucking freaking me out.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.119
- What the fuck is going on?
- Oh, no.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.079
No, no, no, no.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.159
Philip is with Ian.
This is how we're going to get him.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.959
The guards here are Ml5,
by the way.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.479
They know nothing about us.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.999
Hello, Roy.
My name is Milner.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.199
Where's your brother?
Where's Ian?

34:42.280 --> 34:45.079
I don't know.
I've no idea.

34:45.160 --> 34:48.239
- Are you sure, Roy?
- Yes. Why am I here?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.799
I'm in handcuffs.
They put a hood on me.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.199
Did Ian say anything
about me, Roy?

34:52.280 --> 34:57.199
For example, did he say to you,
"Milner is Mr. Rabbit"?

34:57.280 --> 34:59.799
- What are you doing?
- No. No, he never said that.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.519
Are you sure?

35:01.600 --> 35:05.279
He never used the phrase,
"Milner is Mr. Rabbit"?

35:05.360 --> 35:07.719
No.
Who's... who's Mr. Rabbit?

35:10.040 --> 35:13.199
Keep questioning,
but in one hour set him free.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.159
Send him home.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.439
Why did you do that?

35:23.520 --> 35:26.639
- You told him that you were Mr...
- We need Philip.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.479
He's with Ian.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.079
Roy has no idea
where his brother is.

35:31.160 --> 35:35.519
But when Ian discovers that we've
killed Roy... Well, he has a mother.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.399
Killed? No, wait.
Just hang on a minute!

35:38.480 --> 35:42.319
In a few days, I'm going to call
either Paul or one of the other two.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.239
I'll give a command,
a command that only I know...

35:45.320 --> 35:47.599
... and in about 90 days
that person will release...

35:47.680 --> 35:50.999
... the most deadly flu
this world has ever seen.

35:51.080 --> 35:55.159
Everyone will take the vaccine.
Everyone will willingly take Janus.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.519
It'll be chaos, it will,
but in less than 100 years...

35:58.600 --> 36:02.999
... there'll be no more than
500 million people on this planet.

36:03.080 --> 36:06.279
We will have created Utopia.

36:08.080 --> 36:13.839
But if those three men walk out
of that room knowing who I am...

36:14.760 --> 36:18.679
... then in all probability,
all of that disappears.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.439
Hey.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.879
No, look, Milner. Can...
Can we just talk about this a minute?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.759
Cos I... I can't...

36:34.840 --> 36:37.199
I need you, Wilson.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.599
I need someone.

36:40.560 --> 36:45.159
I wish I could leave you as that
beautiful boy that I met, but I can't.

36:47.440 --> 36:51.199
No, I... I can't.
I just... I just can't.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.159
I've been making
decisions like this for 40 years.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.439
Every day.

36:57.240 --> 37:00.839
This decision,
I'm leaving with you.

37:17.840 --> 37:20.919
I nicked a bunch of Reuters files
with the same date on.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.399
There's one here called the global news index.
It catalogues all stories.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.519
What do I look up?

37:26.400 --> 37:28.559
Er... family annihilation?

37:32.520 --> 37:34.399
Right, there's five.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.199
All on the same day.

37:36.280 --> 37:39.319
The one here was in a place
called Denham, off the M25.

37:39.400 --> 37:43.399
Then the one in America,
then killings in Roseira, Brazil...

37:43.480 --> 37:47.759
... Ratanda, South Africa,
and Laishui near Beijing.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.879
I was working with Donaldson.

37:49.960 --> 37:54.999
Last time, when this happened.
He wanted the manuscript.

37:55.080 --> 38:00.519
He has access to an experimental drug,
Thoraxin, that works on Deel's.

38:00.600 --> 38:05.599
He said if that I didn't get him what he
wanted, then I wouldn't have the drugs.

38:05.680 --> 38:10.639
But at... at the last minute I told him
to go fuck himself, and I had that fit...

38:10.720 --> 38:14.879
... and I'm so sorry that I haven't told you
and I've regretted it for so long.

38:14.960 --> 38:19.239
I just wanted everything to be
out in the open between us, okay?

38:19.800 --> 38:21.799
Everything.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.839
Nice jacket. How come a knob-face
like you has suddenly grown a sense...

38:24.920 --> 38:28.319
Grant, for fuck's sake! We're doing something.
Will you just piss off?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.839
Where did that come from?

38:56.760 --> 39:00.079
- Look, Grant, I'm sorry, I...
- Yeah? Sorry, is it?

39:00.160 --> 39:03.759
You made me a killer.
Everyone still thinks I did it.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.559
- And then you made me dead, Ian.
- Grant, put the gun...

39:06.640 --> 39:09.159
No.
You don't tell me what to do no more.

39:09.240 --> 39:11.079
No-one does.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.519
Stay very still, mate.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.919
Stay very fucking still.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.719
They've got Jen and Alice.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.919
They've got my family.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.319
Michael?

40:00.800 --> 40:04.199
I'm gonna help you
get your family back.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.519
I promise.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.199
I'll go.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.239
I'll slip out the back.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.399
I'll come back tomorrow.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.639
Michael.
How lovely to see you.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.559
- I wasn't expecting to see you.
- Well, no, of course not.

40:42.640 --> 40:48.159
Er... I'm sorry to barge in, Michael.
It... it's just... I'm looking for Ian.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.319
Ian?
Why... why do you want Ian?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.959
Why?

40:54.920 --> 40:58.399
- He's wanted for murder, Michael.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.959
- Had you forgotten?
- I had.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.039
I'd fucking...

41:04.400 --> 41:08.479
- What an idiot.
- Oh, so much on your plate.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.959
Ian believes The Network
are running again.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.399
The person he killed
he thought was with them.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.919
Look, I've tried
everywhere else.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.399
I thought there was a remote chance
he'd come to you.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.159
No, no, no,
he's not been here.

41:21.920 --> 41:25.959
I didn't think so.
It's just I'm getting rather desperate.

41:26.720 --> 41:30.079
Well, that's it, really.
I'll be off, leave you to it.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.319
Actually,
could I have some water?

41:32.400 --> 41:35.959
- I'll get it. Kitchen through here?
- Yeah.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.519
- Are you religious, Michael?
- No.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.599
No, not... not at all.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.199
Thought not.

41:45.280 --> 41:46.919
Me neither.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.599
Don't even fucking blink.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.839
What, here?

42:22.920 --> 42:25.879
No, don't be silly. But...

42:25.960 --> 42:27.559
- But I have things to do.
- Yeah.

42:27.640 --> 42:30.479
- That's why I'm killing you.
- Don't be silly, Jessica.

42:30.560 --> 42:32.999
- This isn't... I mean, this...
- It is.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.479
It really is.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.239
Your father's alive.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.879
Look at me.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.279
Look at me, Jessica.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.439
I'm not lying.
You can see that.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.119
He's with Ian.

42:55.080 --> 42:57.399
Ian has Philip.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.999
Let's go see him.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.199
Together.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.759
When you kill,
you don't feel nothing, do you?

43:11.400 --> 43:12.879
No.

43:13.520 --> 43:17.839
For me it's like unscrewing a bottle
to get to the water.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.279
Yeah.

43:22.120 --> 43:24.519
And no-one fucks with you.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.119
They do.
They just do it different.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.279
Will you teach me to shoot?

43:34.800 --> 43:35.959
Yes.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.159
Will you teach me to kill?

43:39.200 --> 43:41.359
No, I don't think I will.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.439
Where are the others?

43:46.520 --> 43:50.279
Up there, talking to Anton,
now they've figured out who he is.

43:50.360 --> 43:53.319
What do you mean,
who he is?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.399
Who is Anton?

44:01.400 --> 44:03.839
I'm... not really
supposed to say.

44:18.040 --> 44:22.559
Look at this: Hartwell, Georgia,
where the American bloke killed his family.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.799
Middle of fucking nowhere.

44:23.880 --> 44:26.959
The only thing that's interesting
is that it has an airfield.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.119
Light aircraft, crop-dusters,
that sort of thing.

44:29.200 --> 44:32.639
- Okay.
- And it's 80 miles from Atlanta airport...

44:32.720 --> 44:35.119
... the busiest airport
in the world.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.239
It's the same with Denham.

44:37.320 --> 44:40.759
It has a tiny airfield, but it's en route
to Heathrow and Gatwick.

44:40.840 --> 44:43.719
It... it's the same
with all these places.

44:43.800 --> 44:47.239
If you were going to spread flu,
that's how you'd do it.

44:47.320 --> 44:49.239
Crop-dusters
in the middle of nowhere...

44:49.320 --> 44:51.719
... but en route to some of
the busiest airports in the world.

44:51.800 --> 44:57.239
Where these families were killed,
that's where they're releasing the virus from.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.359
But why... why kill families?
Why... why kill innocent...

45:00.440 --> 45:02.559
To cover our tracks.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.999
They are sleeper agents.

45:07.920 --> 45:11.199
Trained or brainwashed.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.559
Their job is
to tend the virus.

45:13.640 --> 45:17.759
When they get the call, they place it
in a designated location...

45:17.840 --> 45:20.159
... then they kill themselves
and their families.

45:20.240 --> 45:22.439
All traces gone.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.999
That's how we work,
you see.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.399
Families.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.159
Children.

45:30.240 --> 45:32.119
We are...

45:32.720 --> 45:34.559
... appalling.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.199
Dovada.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.959
Dovada.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.799
- Dovada.
- What does that mean, "dovada"?

45:46.880 --> 45:50.519
Dovada means "proof".
It means "proof".

45:53.560 --> 45:55.919
Why you got the fucking gun?

45:56.480 --> 45:58.759
Go. Go, go, go.

46:00.240 --> 46:01.319
Go on.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.279
Ian!

46:31.520 --> 46:33.599
No, no, no, please!

46:34.160 --> 46:35.959
Please don't.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.759
Please.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.079
You're coming with us.

46:57.160 --> 46:59.679
Don't move! Don't move!

47:04.360 --> 47:05.919
Chi sim bi-doshalo.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.759
Grant...

47:13.000 --> 47:13.759
Grant!

48:02.760 --> 48:04.199
Don't.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.399
No, no, don't do that.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.999
Don't. Please.
Please don't do that. Don't.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.799
Please. Please!
