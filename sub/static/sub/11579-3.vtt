00:01.434 --> 00:03.197
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.269 --> 00:06.636
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.973 --> 00:08.099
In New York City,

00:08.173 --> 00:11.143
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.211 --> 00:14.669
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.748 --> 00:16.545
These are their stories,

00:18.885 --> 00:21.217
Excuse me,
where's the baby formula?

00:21.287 --> 00:23.221
It's around the corner.
I'II show you.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.223
These are on sale.
My brand. Great.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.095
Thanks.
No problem.

00:39.639 --> 00:43.439
Emma? My baby!
Where's my baby?

00:43.510 --> 00:46.308
What's wrong?
Oh, God!
Somebody stole my baby!

00:46.379 --> 00:50.475
Stay right here.
Emma! Emma!

00:51.017 --> 00:53.508
Baby girl, six weeks,
name's Emma Daricek.

00:53.586 --> 00:56.680
White undershirt,
one piece Iong-sleeve
red jumper,

00:56.756 --> 00:58.553
purple socks and sweater,
white booties.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.887
Enough brown hair
for a pink bow.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.517
How Iong did the mother
Ieave the kid alone?

01:01.594 --> 01:03.789
She swears it was
Iess than seconds.
That's all it takes.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.728
The store have a protocol
for missing kids?

01:05.799 --> 01:08.461
Security says it took
about three minutes
to close off all the exits.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.866
We're searching
aisle by aisle now,

01:09.936 --> 01:12.928
getting names and addresses
of employees and customers
before they can Ieave.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.065
Okay. How many other mothers
were in here when it happened?

01:15.141 --> 01:18.542
Seven. Mrs. Daricek eyeballed
every one of those babies.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.805
Where is she now?

01:19.879 --> 01:22.040
Back in the manager's office
beating herself up.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.515
Husband's on his way.
STABLER: Witnesses?

01:25.151 --> 01:26.641
Nobody saw it happen.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.186
Baby snatchers travel Iight.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.655
Perp Iifts the kid out
of one cart, sticks her
in another. Two seconds, done.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.385
OFFICER: Detectives.
What's up?

01:33.460 --> 01:37.726
Motor Vehicle office down
the street. They found
something in the Iadies' room.

01:38.698 --> 01:39.824
What do you got?

01:39.899 --> 01:42.060
She found these baby clothes
in the garbage can here.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.103
Snatcher probably
disguised the girl as a boy.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.900
Afraid that the baby would
get recognized on the street.
What's all this?

01:46.973 --> 01:49.441
OFFICER: We got an eyedropper
and some capsules.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.374
It's Librium.
Sedative.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.878
Perp could be an alcoholic
trying to control the shakes.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.280
Dissolve some in water,
feed it to the baby
so she doesn't cry,

01:57.350 --> 01:59.284
calmly walk out of the store.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.980
And then give her a haircut.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:50.703 --> 02:52.967
I just walked away
for one moment
and she was gone.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.131
How could this happen?

02:54.207 --> 02:56.038
Did you notice anyone
in the aisles watching you?

02:56.109 --> 02:57.474
I don't remember...
Did anyone stop to talk?

02:57.544 --> 02:59.273
Well, did anyone
pay unusual attention to Emma?

02:59.345 --> 03:02.610
I don't know! Will you stop
asking me questions
and just go find her!

03:02.682 --> 03:04.980
Michele, you gotta
try to calm down
so we can help you...

03:05.051 --> 03:06.541
Calm down? I Ieft her alone!

03:06.619 --> 03:09.087
But torturing yourself
isn't going to bring
your daughter back.

03:09.155 --> 03:10.452
Michele!
Tony.

03:10.523 --> 03:14.118
Hey. Hang on now.
How did it happen?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.253
I took my eyes off her.
I'm so sorry.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.990
It'II be okay...
It's way past Emma's feeding.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.760
I know she's hungry. PIease.
You've got to find her!

03:20.833 --> 03:23.768
We're doing everything
that we can. May I
speak to you one minute?

03:23.836 --> 03:25.997
I'II be right back,
sweetheart.

03:26.339 --> 03:27.704
Michele.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.332
TONY: You're gonna
find Emma, right?

03:29.409 --> 03:32.640
Every second counts.
That's why we need your help
to calm your wife down.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.839
I've been trying to do that
ever since Emma was born.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.041
And what does that mean?

03:37.617 --> 03:41.713
One minute everything's okay,
the next Michele's crying
and throwing things.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.850
This is the first time
she's been out of the house
with Emma.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.484
I'm worried.
Is your wife
taking any medication?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.858
I can't even get her
to see a doctor.
I gotta get back there.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.624
Mr. Daricek, I have
four children of my own,

03:51.698 --> 03:53.495
so I can't even imagine
what you're going through,

03:53.566 --> 03:55.329
but I...
What are you saying?

03:56.169 --> 03:58.137
I don't want to jump
to any conclusions here,

03:58.204 --> 04:00.900
but it sounds Iike your
wife's going through
postpartum depression.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.733
Yeah. Okay.
She's stressed out.

04:03.810 --> 04:08.042
Look, if I thought
Emma was in any danger,
I swear I'd take her away.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.514
You think if Michele
harmed her baby she
would be rational enough

04:14.587 --> 04:16.350
to plant the clothes
and hair in the bathroom?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.720
Can't rule it out.
This was pretty well planned.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.553
Felt more Iike
somebody desperate for a baby

04:20.627 --> 04:21.753
who couldn't get one
the Iegal way.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.352
Well, either way,
the clock is running.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.987
We don't find Emma soon,
she's gone for good.

04:25.064 --> 04:26.895
That's why I called in
the mobile command post.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.558
We'II save time
working from here, all right?

04:28.635 --> 04:32.002
EIIiot, if you think
she knows something,
find out. Fast.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.038
Michele, was she wearing
anything else
besides the jumper?

04:38.544 --> 04:41.911
It was cold.
She was sleeping
wrapped in a blanket.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.617
Emma cries
when she gets cold.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.685
You know, when my
first daughter was born,

04:48.788 --> 04:50.688
I was working the midnight
to 8:00 a.m. shift,

04:50.757 --> 04:52.588
my wife worked days.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.219
So when I got home
all I wanted to do was sleep,

04:57.430 --> 04:59.898
all my baby
wanted to do was cry.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.000
I nearly Iost my mind.
I could barely function.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.734
It's so hard.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.172
Michele, I know
what you're going through.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.747
The first baby
is always the toughest.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.514
I feel blessed every day
because I have Emma.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.053
I Iove her so much.

05:35.201 --> 05:37.362
Am I ever gonna see her again?

05:41.641 --> 05:42.767
(CRYING)

05:46.846 --> 05:48.677
We make the proper
notifications?

05:48.748 --> 05:51.308
Airports, train
and bus stations
are all covered.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.352
Photos of Emma
are going out
to every toll booth

05:53.419 --> 05:55.751
and police department
within a 100-mile radius.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.756
We're also checking on
any attempted snatchings

05:57.824 --> 05:59.257
where the baby's sex
was disguised.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.054
Anything from your canvass?

06:01.127 --> 06:04.654
Only thing we came up with
is a woman with a suitcase
in her shopping cart.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.098
Get with store security,
see what they got
on the videotapes.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.732
FIN: You have someone
watching this all day?

06:12.805 --> 06:15.205
SECURITY GUARD:
This isn't a Vegas casino.
Here it is.

06:15.274 --> 06:18.175
So mom checks out
the merchandise.

06:18.444 --> 06:22.437
Mystery shopper Iifts the kid,
and it wasn't the mother.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.642
Damn it, can't see her face.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.777
This the only angle
you have on this?
Yeah. That part
of the store, yeah.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.517
What about the front doors?
We got cameras
on the entrance and exit.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.889
MUNCH: Get the exit tape
from that time of day
and hurry up.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.827
What kind of woman would steal
somebody else's kid?

06:36.929 --> 06:40.592
Could be maternal instinct
run amuck or maybe
it's strictly business.

06:41.534 --> 06:45.800
Not her. Not her. Not her.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.301
Pause it.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.641
Kid would be screaming
if she was in that suitcase.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.941
Unless she's already
been doped up.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.076
Nobody saw her
take Emma out of the store.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.414
Why risk stopping to change
the baby's appearance?

06:59.485 --> 07:01.385
Nobody's Iooking
for a Iittle boy.

07:01.454 --> 07:05.049
EIIiot's still with
the Dariceks. So Iet's rule
Michele out for the moment.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.250
Did our mystery Iady...
Thank you.

07:06.325 --> 07:07.690
...buy the suitcase
in the store?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.523
About half an hour
before the snatch.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.063
Paid with a credit card
in the name of Susan Young.

07:12.131 --> 07:15.066
Works downtown
at Social Services.
AII right. Go.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.296
My purse was stolen
this morning.
Where?

07:21.574 --> 07:23.235
Substance abuse center
where I work.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.470
I filled out a report
at the precinct in Chinatown.

07:25.545 --> 07:26.807
You guys found it already?

07:26.879 --> 07:29.746
No, but we think this woman
used one of your credit cards.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.182
AIicia.
You know her?

07:32.251 --> 07:35.846
I saw her
a couple of hours ago.
She's one of my clients.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.185
I don't believe this.
Does she have
access to Librium?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.890
She's not taking it.
She could get some
from someone at the clinic.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.987
AIicia's a crack addict.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.124
She was doing so well, too.
Hadn't used since
she got pregnant.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.362
When did she have the baby?
Last week.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.700
Stillborn.
It's a real tragedy.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.240
Where does she Iive?
10th Avenue, the 50s.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.799
I can call my office,
get the exact address.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.912
Start in the kitchen.
Must have found herself
a nice job.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.783
Or a sugar daddy.
I'II take the bedroom.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.426
No sign of a kid here.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.295
She's back on the pipe.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.234
Must be feeding
her habit with this.

08:25.304 --> 08:28.967
Found it in the closet.
AII 100s.
There's a couple
thousand dollars.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.302
(DOOR OPENS)

08:33.712 --> 08:37.649
BENSON: Stop! Police!
Get off me, bitch!
Get your hands off me!

08:37.717 --> 08:41.153
Let me go!
Shut up! Shut up.

08:41.386 --> 08:44.720
AII right. Where's that baby?
My baby is dead.

08:44.790 --> 08:48.089
You took that baby
from the store.
Now where is she?

08:48.227 --> 08:51.663
I gave her away.
You sold that baby
for crack money!

08:51.731 --> 08:54.666
I had to.
I promised him my baby,
my baby died...

08:54.734 --> 08:57.168
Okay, AIicia.
Who did you promise
the baby to?

08:57.236 --> 09:02.003
A Iawyer.
I put her up for adoption.
Give me a name.
Give me a name.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.401
I can't tell you.
Huh? You can't tell me?
Look at me.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.045
Now, you tell me a name.

09:09.115 --> 09:12.573
Mark. Mark Sanford.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.483
I took the baby
to him in Chelsea.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.024
You hear that?
Yeah.

09:25.097 --> 09:26.962
WALLER: Who's down there?
Upstairs.

09:30.803 --> 09:33.863
Police. Open up.
The police are here.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.304
Who was that?
The police.
I thought you were burglars.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.469
What are you doing?

09:40.112 --> 09:42.580
The Iast number
you just dialed wasn't 911.
Who are you?

09:42.648 --> 09:44.673
I take care of the babies.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.714
You're gonna wake them.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.618
Which one's Emma?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.524
These children
were all given up
for adoption...

09:52.592 --> 09:55.493
One of these babies was stolen
from her mother this morning.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.324
I didn't do anything wrong.

10:02.301 --> 10:05.168
Emma. Right here.
Look, I didn't know.

10:05.237 --> 10:09.196
Ma'am, you are under arrest
for kidnapping.
But I didn't kidnap anybody.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.971
It's okay.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.582
Two girls and one boy.
Six weeks to two months old.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.490
Pediatrician says they were
well taken care of
and in excellent health.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.460
Peddling sick babies
would be bad business.

10:29.528 --> 10:30.995
We know who the peddler is?

10:31.063 --> 10:35.466
The brownstone where we
found the babies was rented
to Adoptions Incorporated.

10:35.534 --> 10:39.095
The Iease was signed
by a Mark Sanford.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.605
Well, I had Fin
notify Michele Daricek.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.835
Do we have any idea
who the other kids belong to?

10:43.909 --> 10:46.002
We don't even know
if they were kidnapped
or sold.

10:46.078 --> 10:49.605
ACS is coming to take custody
of them. We'II get their
photos out to the media.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.240
You know somebody's
gonna come forward.

Yeah, every couple
who'd Iove to adopt them.

11:48.340 --> 11:52.174
You two check with the FBI
and the Center for Missing
and Exploited Children.

11:52.244 --> 11:55.873
See if they have any reported
snatchings that could be
our other two babies.

11:56.816 --> 12:00.377
I'm a registered nurse.
I was hired to care
for the infants.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.013
Babies tucked away
in an otherwise
empty brownstone

12:03.089 --> 12:04.454
and you didn't think
that was odd?

12:04.523 --> 12:07.458
They're kept there
until their adoptive parents
come for them.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.756
Who brings you the babies?
Mr. Sanford.

12:09.829 --> 12:11.319
FIN: The guy you called
on your cell phone.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.422
When you Iied and said
you were calling the police.

12:13.499 --> 12:18.232
Mr. Sanford is a wonderful man
who places unwanted babies
in Ioving homes.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.432
Tell us where this Sanford is
or you're an accessory.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.903
He's a Iawyer. His office
is out in Kew Gardens.

12:31.984 --> 12:33.542
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

12:38.023 --> 12:40.753
Going somewhere, Mark?
Look, I have nothing to say

12:40.826 --> 12:42.054
without my attorney present.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.823
We'II have him meet us
at the precinct.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.660
Mark Sanford,
you're under arrest
for kidnapping.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.563
You have the right
to remain silent.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.535
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of Iaw.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.094
You have the right
to an attorney.

12:53.172 --> 12:56.073
I have never knowingly
put a stolen child
up for adoption.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.839
My client
is a distinguished member
of the Iegal community.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.072
To whom babies
are just product.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.876
Those babies were
signed over to us
by their birth mothers.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.579
And you bought
Michele Daricek's baby
from a crackhead for $10,000.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.122
AIicia Brown gave up her son
two years ago for adoption.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.283
She contacted me
when she was pregnant again.

13:13.359 --> 13:16.294
I had no reason to believe
the Iittle girl wasn't hers.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.761
And that pile of cash
you Iaid on her?

13:17.830 --> 13:21.322
It's reimbursement
for expenses related to
the pregnancy and the birth.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.197
I mean, it's how it's done.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.363
And in your role
as humanitarian,
what's in it for you?

13:26.438 --> 13:30.932
Well, Mr. Sanford receives
a modest fee for his services,
Iike any other attorney.

13:31.010 --> 13:34.002
How much?
It's $20,000.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.840
SORENSEN: He is not
in the business of buying
and selling children,

13:38.551 --> 13:40.280
It's your call, Counselor.

13:42.388 --> 13:46.051
Unless we can establish
he knew what AIicia was going
to do, kidnapping's a stretch.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.491
Prove he sold Emma
and it's grand Iarceny.

13:48.561 --> 13:52.793
Emma's a human being,
not stolen property. Grand
Iarceny's the best you can do?

13:52.898 --> 13:55.731
We can hold Sanford
for six days
on the kidnapping charge.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.496
You think you can
make a case by then?

13:57.570 --> 14:00.664
We're searching his home
and office, seizing his files
and computers.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.173
There must be something
in there that'II nail him.

14:05.377 --> 14:09.404
If you two are done
surfing the Web...
Sanford's website.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.909
"Happy Homes."
Listen to this.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.987
"Laura, blue eyes.
A tiny bundle of Iove
to share with you."

14:16.155 --> 14:18.851
Three marriages, no children.
You ever consider adopting?

14:18.924 --> 14:21.620
The kindest thing
I could ever do
for a kid is not adopt.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.091
What do you got on Sanford?

14:25.231 --> 14:28.792
Born and raised in Brooklyn,
graduated Buffalo State
in '76,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.098
Law School
of the Ozarks in '79,

14:31.170 --> 14:35.231
admitted to the New York
State Bar in '85 and never
set foot in a courtroom.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.706
Anything in his records?

14:36.775 --> 14:38.902
MUNCH: We haven't
found the official
adoption papers yet,

14:38.978 --> 14:41.538
but he kept this Iedger
of his transactions
for each year.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.445
This one's 1989.

April 14th, April 23rd,

14:49.521 --> 14:51.512
another baby boy, June 2nd.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.784
John, give me
that Iast date again.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.722
1989, June 2nd.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.327
Where are these kids' names?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.425
There's a page number
to the right of each entry.

15:03.502 --> 15:07.165
Each page has
the pre-adoption stats
on every child.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.402
CRAGEN: Page 42.
What's going on, Captain?

15:14.179 --> 15:15.771
Stephen Talmadge.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.653
Back in '89, a woman
named Jennifer Talmadge

15:29.728 --> 15:33.494
was found murdered
in her apartment,
Iigature strangulation.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.961
Her four-week-old son,
Stephen,

15:36.035 --> 15:38.697
was missing from his crib.
Case is still open.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.601
The murder
or the missing kid?
Both.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.309
You didn't know Max Greevey.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.776
He was my sergeant
when I ran the 27.

15:46.845 --> 15:50.406
He caught the case,
worked it Iike his
own kid was missing,

15:50.482 --> 15:53.144
until he was murdered
on the job in '91.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.846
This thing's been kicking you
in the ass for a dozen years.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.456
Stephen is still alive.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.455
It's really gotten to you,
huh?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.595
It's not just about Stephen.

16:08.467 --> 16:12.403
Jennifer Talmadge's parents
call once a year
on his birthday

16:12.471 --> 16:14.496
and ask if I had any news.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.732
The calls stopped coming
three years ago.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.008
I could use your help on this.

16:22.014 --> 16:25.450
With all due respect,
Captain...
"I don't usually work cases"?

16:25.517 --> 16:28.315
You're right.
This is different.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.228
Oh, my Lord. Come in.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.163
Herbert!
HERBERT: What is it?

16:44.236 --> 16:45.726
It's Captain Cragen.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.542
You have news?
There's been a development.

16:52.711 --> 16:55.111
You found Stephen?
You caught Jennifer's killer?

16:55.180 --> 16:57.774
There's a Iead.
That's all for now.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.753
I thought the investigation
was on hold.
I thought you'd given up.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.826
Come in, Captain.
Let us show you something.

17:11.964 --> 17:16.560
We celebrate
Stephen's birthdays, buy him
presents every Christmas.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.800
MARGARET: This is his room.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.832
So you see, Captain.
We never Iost hope.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.048
If your client
is willing to cooperate...
Where's Stephen Talmadge?

17:30.582 --> 17:31.742
Who?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.875
What, you forgot
to tell your new
hotshot Iawyer

17:33.952 --> 17:35.817
you kidnapped a baby
after killing the mother?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.083
What, are you crazy?
It's all right here
in your book.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.216
We're willing to deal
in exchange for information.

17:40.292 --> 17:42.453
No. You can't prove
that I kidnapped
or killed anybody.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.120
Not now and not then. No.

17:44.196 --> 17:47.131
Actually, we have specific...
The offer's good
for 10 more seconds.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.465
You don't have a case.
CRAGEN: Oh, really?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.763
After I tie you
to the Talmadge kidnapping
and murder,

17:55.841 --> 17:57.866
I'm gonna nail your ass
to the wall.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.076
(DOOR BUZZING)

18:05.717 --> 18:06.979
What the hell was that?

18:07.052 --> 18:09.782
Well, you weren't
getting him to talk,
so I had to give it a shot.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.550
What?
With the macho cop routine?

18:11.623 --> 18:13.420
I could have used
the kidnapping charge
as Ieverage

18:13.492 --> 18:14.720
if you'd just given me
the chance.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.920
I gave you your chance.
You Iost your cool.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.986
You are too
emotionally invested
in this case.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.395
Damn right.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.330
I read all of Greevey's files.

18:24.403 --> 18:25.631
He interviewed
a Iot of people who said

18:25.704 --> 18:28.434
what a wonderful person
Jennifer Talmadge was.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.767
Too bad none of them
can give us any Ieads
on her murder.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.504
What about forensics?

18:32.578 --> 18:35.376
Only one set of prints
at the murder scene
unaccounted for.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.915
I ran them again,
no match in the system.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.017
Try this.
What is it?

18:40.085 --> 18:42.986
Max's notes. His widow, Marie,
gave them to me Iast night.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.682
You are on a mission.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.859
I've been on this
for 1 2 years.
I want some closure.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.858
Where are we
on Sanford's other babies?

18:52.931 --> 18:56.526
We talked to the couple
adopting the boy.
They're getting him tomorrow.

18:56.602 --> 18:59.298
The baby girl
goes with her new parents
the day after that.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.066
Both adoptions are Iegal?

19:01.273 --> 19:03.673
According to ACS,
Sanford followed
all the rules.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.835
Social worker sent
to do home studies,

19:05.911 --> 19:09.779
the parents had to take
medical exams to rule out
Iife-threatening illnesses.

19:09.848 --> 19:12.578
The birth mothers
and fathers all consented.

19:12.651 --> 19:16.314
The papers were signed,
notarized, witnessed,
registered in court.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.080
As far as we can tell,
there's no indication

19:18.157 --> 19:20.648
he's put any other
snatched babies
up for adoption

19:20.726 --> 19:22.626
besides Talmadge and Daricek.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.390
So what's his scam?
Sanford's triple-dipping.

19:25.464 --> 19:28.490
He promises one baby
to three different families,

19:28.567 --> 19:31.365
then he tells two of
the families that the mother
changed her mind,

19:31.436 --> 19:33.233
keeps the money.
How much?

19:33.438 --> 19:37.204
$30,000 a couple.
And none of these victims
call the cops?

19:37.276 --> 19:38.334
FIN: They're desperate.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.173
They're afraid if they snitch
and word gets out,

19:40.245 --> 19:42.236
no other baby brokers
will deal with them.

19:42.314 --> 19:45.943
You get anywhere
on Sanford's files?
Found his phone bills
for 1989.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.078
Phone company's
getting us the names
of all his outgoing calls.

19:49.154 --> 19:52.055
These files are at Ieast
a three-person job.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.118
This is interesting.
What's that?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.787
Greevey has a note
in here about Jennifer's
college roommate, Rebecca.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.489
Says he was supposed to
talk to her in England.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.759
There's nothing
in the case file
that says they ever spoke.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.791
Well, that means Max
never talked to her.
Let's track her down.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.338
MUNCH:
Were you and Jennifer close?

20:11.143 --> 20:15.239
In a college roommate
sort of way. We shared
a suite at the dorm.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.213
Then you must have known
if she had any boyfriends.

20:18.283 --> 20:22.151
Just one. Broke her heart.
Who was he?

20:22.688 --> 20:24.315
A guy named Rob.

20:24.489 --> 20:27.049
Met him at a party and,
you know,
they dated a couple of times

20:27.125 --> 20:30.390
before she brought him
back to the suite
to stay over.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.224
The first time I saw him,
I knew he was trouble.

20:33.298 --> 20:34.595
Why?

20:34.700 --> 20:38.033
Well, I warned Jen that I had
seen him walking on the campus
with another girl,

20:38.103 --> 20:41.197
but, you know...
Jen, she was a Iittle naive.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.001
She was in Iove with him,
you know,
I think he was her first.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.376
MUNCH: How Iong
did they go out?
About two weeks

20:48.513 --> 20:51.311
before he broke up with her.
He give a reason?

20:52.217 --> 20:53.946
Guys never do.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.055
Did you know
Jennifer was pregnant?

20:58.123 --> 21:01.650
Not at first, but, you know,
she couldn't hide it for Iong.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.922
She knew Rob
had to be the father.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.327
What's Rob's Iast name?
Cook.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.495
Robert Cook.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.068
Any idea if she told him?
Yeah. She sent him a Ietter.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.367
Thank you.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.671
CRAGEN: Robert Cook?

21:22.014 --> 21:23.606
Can I help you?

21:23.982 --> 21:25.210
NYPD,

21:25.284 --> 21:27.809
Captain Donald Cragen,
Detective John Munch.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.786
Just be a second, boys.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.247
It's the future of baseball.

21:32.324 --> 21:36.727
Well, you know, for now
we're just trying to win
one Little League game.

21:36.795 --> 21:40.629
But you didn't come here
to watch us play.
We're here about your son.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.999
He's what? About 12?

21:43.101 --> 21:45.661
The older one, Brandon, is,
but I don't understand.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.728
Do you have
his birth certificate?
His mother's got it.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.239
Where is she?
She's up in Mahopac,

21:49.308 --> 21:51.105
we're recently divorced.
What the hell's going on here?

21:51.176 --> 21:53.041
We're gonna have to ask you
and your son to come with us.

21:53.111 --> 21:55.511
Excuse me?
I don't even know
what this is about.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.979
Jennifer Talmadge.

21:58.283 --> 22:01.582
From college?
She was murdered 12 years ago.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.981
Yeah, I know that,
but what's that
got to do with me?

22:04.056 --> 22:06.786
Her son disappeared.
We think you're the father.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.328
I read about Jennifer
in the paper,
but I swear in a million years

22:13.398 --> 22:15.423
I never thought
that child was mine.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.664
We only slept together
a few times.
Sixth grade sex ed.
Once is enough.

22:19.738 --> 22:22.036
So, you had a fling
with Jennifer,
and then you dumped her.

22:22.107 --> 22:23.506
It was college.

22:23.575 --> 22:27.238
My girlfriend Linda and I
were on the outs,
so I was dating Jennifer.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.974
But you didn't count on
knocking her up.

22:30.215 --> 22:34.618
Jennifer showing up with a kid
would've put a crimp in your
big plans for the future.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.782
I broke up with her, I didn't
kill her. I didn't even know
she was pregnant.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.620
Her roommate said
that Jennifer sent you
a Ietter.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.853
I never got any Ietter.

22:42.928 --> 22:46.091
Mr. Cook, can you prove
Brandon is your son
with your ex-wife?

22:46.164 --> 22:47.654
Of course I can.

22:51.970 --> 22:56.236
You think I killed Jennifer
and then somehow
adopted my own child?

22:59.611 --> 23:02.273
I broke up with Jennifer
because Linda told me
she was pregnant.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.508
We got married
as soon as the semester
was over.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.016
Brandon is our son.

23:11.923 --> 23:14.756
We're going to need DNA
from all three of you.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.161
You have Brandon's
birth certificate.
Is this really necessary?

23:25.237 --> 23:28.035
I'm only complying
with the court order,
Mrs. Cook.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.696
Linda...
Don't.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.743
If you kept it
in your pants...
We were kids...

23:31.810 --> 23:33.710
And now we're
murder suspects.
This is not the time.

23:33.779 --> 23:37.146
I resent being dragged
in here, having to prove
my son is my son.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.807
Mrs. Cook, you're next.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.546
LINDA: No. I want my attorney.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.285
Your attorney
is going to tell you
if you don't comply,

23:44.356 --> 23:47.348
we're gonna be ordered
to arrest you
for contempt of court.

23:49.060 --> 23:52.587
I have plenty of contempt
for this. Make it quick.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.506
Done?
Thank you
for your patience.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.667
Let's get out of here.

24:06.478 --> 24:08.673
Mitochondrial DNA
on Cook's 12-year-old

24:08.747 --> 24:10.681
doesn't match
Jennifer Talmadge's mother.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.273
Meaning he's not
Jennifer's son.

24:12.350 --> 24:14.614
He is, however,
the son of Linda
and Robert Cook.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.517
99.9 % probability.

24:16.588 --> 24:19.182
Captain, you better
take a Iook at these.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.482
Where'd you get this?

24:20.559 --> 24:23.050
From what we found stored
in Mark Sanford's basement.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.756
Why?
Stephen Talmadge's
adoption papers.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.628
Signed by his mother.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.432
It's not possible.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.800
We have copies
of the adoption papers.

24:32.871 --> 24:34.668
But Jennifer changed her mind.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.969
At first she was ashamed.

24:37.075 --> 24:41.375
You know, she thought we were,
too, but we said we would
support her financially.

24:41.446 --> 24:45.212
We'd watch Stephen
during the day
so she could finish college.

24:45.283 --> 24:47.308
May we see those papers,
please?

24:52.524 --> 24:55.152
This isn't
Jennifer's signature.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.525
Are you sure?
Yes.

24:57.696 --> 25:01.132
Do we still have
Jennifer's passport.
Let me see.

25:02.267 --> 25:05.202
Did Jennifer tell you
who the father was?

25:05.303 --> 25:10.036
No. She said
she tried to contact him,
but he never responded.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.702
Here. See for yourself.

25:17.382 --> 25:19.077
It's not even close.

25:19.284 --> 25:23.015
You think this has
anything to do
with Jennifer's murder?

25:23.221 --> 25:26.622
That's what we're
gonna find out.
Thank you.

25:29.327 --> 25:32.353
CRAGEN: Adoption papers.
Passport.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.556
Signatures don't match.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.795
You're screwed.

25:39.905 --> 25:42.999
I didn't forge any papers,
I didn't steal any babies,

25:43.074 --> 25:44.541
I didn't kill anyone.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.043
You defraud couples
desperate for children.

25:47.112 --> 25:51.481
When we present your scam
in court, a jury will convict
you of murder and kidnapping.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.650
What's your offer?

25:57.722 --> 26:01.488
No jail time,
he makes restitution to
all the couples he defrauded.

26:01.626 --> 26:03.958
And you give me
Stephen Talmadge.

26:07.632 --> 26:11.363
A woman came to me
with a baby,
purporting to be the mother.

26:11.469 --> 26:14.836
She had the boy's original
birth certificate. I didn't
know she was an imposter

26:14.906 --> 26:17.875
and then I saw
Jennifer Talmadge's picture
in the papers, and...

26:17.943 --> 26:20.503
And you couldn't risk
going to the cops.

26:24.482 --> 26:27.940
You give me the name
of the family
that adopted Stephen. Now.

26:30.655 --> 26:34.352
DANIEL: Line drive into center
field. Looks Iike it's over
the second baseman's head.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.452
But BIake makes
a brilliant catch,
ending up the game.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.956
Hello?
Thanks, we don't want any.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.691
It's the cops.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.202
Mom, the police are here.

26:48.273 --> 26:52.107
Oh, for heaven's sake, Tyler,
where are your manners?

26:52.177 --> 26:55.806
Come in, Officers.
Danny, Brian, Tyler, outside.

26:57.215 --> 27:01.345
Hey, you guys Iooking
for Tyler? The way he played
second base was a crime.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.183
ERIN: How can I help you?

27:06.257 --> 27:10.591
Mrs. BIake,
Captain Don Cragen,
Detective John Munch.

27:10.762 --> 27:14.391
Is Tyler your son?
Yes, of course.
What's going on?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.832
Did you adopt him
through Mark Sanford?

27:17.002 --> 27:19.664
Yes. How did you know
he was adopted?

27:19.738 --> 27:22.832
Was Tyler born
on June 2nd, 1989?

27:23.942 --> 27:26.672
Why are you asking
all these questions?

27:32.851 --> 27:34.318
Kidnapped?

27:36.454 --> 27:38.012
Are you sure?

27:38.823 --> 27:40.586
Sanford admitted
what happened.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.890
A DNA test will confirm
he's Stephen Talmadge.

27:44.863 --> 27:49.197
What am I gonna tell
my husband and Tyler?

27:55.306 --> 27:58.366
Do you have to take him?
You can come with him.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.312
We didn't do
anything wrong.
We know.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.906
He's been missing
for 12 years.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.356
Tyler.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.792
I'm not going.
I don't wanna Ieave!

28:23.568 --> 28:27.561
Go upstairs and get changed.
I'II call your dad at work.

28:28.239 --> 28:31.265
We'II go together.
Hey, you're not in trouble.

28:54.999 --> 28:58.992
Is it definite?
The DNA is conclusive,
Mr. Cook.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.531
Tyler is your biological son.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.506
How can I ever explain to him
what happened?

29:07.212 --> 29:08.873
Why I wasn't there for him?

29:08.947 --> 29:12.178
When the time is right,
you'II tell him the truth.

29:13.151 --> 29:15.244
He's almost a teenager.

29:15.820 --> 29:18.550
There's still plenty of time
for you to get to know him.

29:21.126 --> 29:23.594
The family who raised him,
they did a good job,
didn't they?

29:23.661 --> 29:27.188
Oh, he's had a good Iife,
wonderful mother and father.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.360
I'm his father.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.335
I never would have
abandoned him.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.273
He belongs with me.

29:49.587 --> 29:54.115
We fed him, we clothed him.
He's Iike our own flesh
and blood.

29:54.359 --> 29:56.827
Mark Sanford told us
it was all Iegal.

29:56.895 --> 30:00.092
Tyler's biological father
never consented
to the adoption.

30:00.165 --> 30:03.396
That nullifies it.
For God's sake,
he's our son!

30:03.535 --> 30:06.561
You can't just take him away
after all these years.

30:06.638 --> 30:11.598
I know how hard
this must be for you...
We are the only parents
he has ever known.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.278
We were a happy family
until you came along.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.472
How could you do this to us?

30:18.449 --> 30:20.747
We can't play Solomon
and split the child.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.083
I can't get him into
a foster home
until tomorrow morning.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.678
I hate to do it,
but I think Tyler's
gonna have to

30:24.756 --> 30:26.189
spend the night
at the Laight Street Shelter.

30:26.257 --> 30:27.451
Why put him in that hellhole

30:27.525 --> 30:29.618
when his grandparents
have right of
natural guardianship?

30:29.694 --> 30:30.718
I don't Iike it
any more than you do,

30:30.795 --> 30:32.763
but the Iaw doesn't
give grandparents
automatic custody...

30:32.831 --> 30:34.230
Just forget the Iaw
and just for one minute

30:34.299 --> 30:36.164
think about
what's in the best interests
of this child!

30:36.234 --> 30:37.724
Don't you think I am?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.560
Right now everybody
wants a piece of Tyler.

30:39.637 --> 30:42.037
Maybe the best place for him
is somewhere neutral.

30:42.106 --> 30:44.370
Why don't you tell that
to his grandparents?

30:44.943 --> 30:47.002
Right this way. Thank you.

30:50.481 --> 30:53.678
You know how Iong we've waited
for this moment, Captain.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.582
Our daughter was taken away,

30:55.653 --> 30:58.747
and now you're telling us
that we can't have
our grandson?

30:58.823 --> 31:02.691
I can't release Tyler to you
unless a judge says I can,

31:02.760 --> 31:05.024
but you can apply
for temporary custody.

31:05.096 --> 31:08.463
We have to go to court?
What about permanent custody?

31:09.934 --> 31:14.803
Tyler's biological father
is probably going to claim
his parental rights,

31:14.873 --> 31:18.502
and as Iong as
he's deemed fit,
his rights supersede yours.

31:18.643 --> 31:21.134
His mother was our only child.

31:22.513 --> 31:25.141
You gave us our hope back.

31:25.383 --> 31:28.352
Now how can you just
take it away from us
Iike this?

31:31.990 --> 31:34.117
So what happens to me?

31:34.926 --> 31:38.453
Well, you'II have to go
to a temporary home
until a judge decides.

31:38.529 --> 31:41.157
I wanna just go home
with my parents.

31:41.399 --> 31:45.096
I know you do,
but your adoption was illegal.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.603
So what?
They never hurt me
or did anything wrong.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.565
They Iove me.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.408
I know they do.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.669
Tyler...

31:58.416 --> 31:59.883
I'm sorry,

32:00.285 --> 32:02.276
but what I did today
is my job.

32:02.487 --> 32:05.388
I didn't want to take you,
but I had to
because the Iaw says so.

32:05.456 --> 32:07.890
But the Iaw also says
that I have to protect you

32:07.959 --> 32:09.517
from anything bad

32:09.594 --> 32:12.722
and that's a part of my job
I Iike. Okay?

32:16.034 --> 32:17.262
AII right.

32:23.374 --> 32:26.571
Hey. Your mother's parents,

32:26.644 --> 32:29.238
your grandparents,
they wanna meet you.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.979
Are you ready?

32:37.155 --> 32:40.955
I guess. Do I have to
hug them or anything?
Hey.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.387
You just do
whatever you feel, all right?

32:50.601 --> 32:51.863
Stephen.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.367
My name is Tyler.

32:58.776 --> 33:00.175
Nice to meet you,

33:00.745 --> 33:01.803
Tyler.

33:04.749 --> 33:08.014
PIease... PIease don't cry.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.280
AII right.

33:19.764 --> 33:20.924
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

33:24.969 --> 33:26.368
Got a minute?

33:26.437 --> 33:28.962
Only if you promise
not to tell me
you told me so.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.099
You were just doing your job.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.666
Following the Iead
of a 12-year-old crime.

33:34.445 --> 33:38.438
And now Tyler BIake's
the victim and I don't know
how to fix it.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.210
Then Iet me help.

33:42.887 --> 33:45.856
You have any suggestions,
I'm all ears.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.786
Tyler's going to need
a Iaw guardian
for the adoption hearing.

33:48.860 --> 33:53.024
There's a three-week backlog
on court-appointed attorneys,
so I'II volunteer.

33:53.398 --> 33:57.767
Well, that's a hell of a
gesture, AIex, but the Iaw
favors the biological parent.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.667
The Iaw also says
that Tyler is old enough
and mature enough

34:00.738 --> 34:02.706
to know who he
wants to Iive with.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.538
If I'm his attorney,
I have to fight
for what he wants,

34:05.610 --> 34:08.135
and he wants to Iive
with the BIakes.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.753
Tyler is an articulate,
intelligent 12-year-old.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.018
CABOT: You've talked to him,
you've read the reports.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.425
What's your conclusion
about how Tyler functions
in his world?

34:24.495 --> 34:25.723
That he's well-adjusted.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.891
He gets excellent grades
and he has Iots of friends.

34:28.966 --> 34:32.402
And what did this indicate
to you about his home Iife?

34:32.469 --> 34:36.804
That Tyler is the child
of Ioving parents,
the product of a happy home.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.808
CABOT: If Tyler was
forced to Iive
with his biological father,

34:39.877 --> 34:42.208
how do you think
this would affect his Iife?

34:42.280 --> 34:44.543
That would be akin to
waking up in the morning

34:44.614 --> 34:46.879
and Iearning that his parents
had been killed
in a car crash.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.612
A sudden traumatic Ioss.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.983
CABOT: And what could be
the consequences?

34:51.121 --> 34:54.319
Children that experience
a sudden Ioss
of a parent or caretaker

34:54.391 --> 34:56.952
often suffer from
behavioral problems.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.188
Not to mention the depression
that a child his age

34:59.263 --> 35:01.891
often goes through
after something so traumatic.

35:01.966 --> 35:03.729
In your opinion then, Doctor,
would you recommend

35:03.801 --> 35:06.269
that Tyler be placed
with his biological father?

35:06.337 --> 35:07.497
No.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.870
That would be asking him
to make too huge a transition

35:09.941 --> 35:12.501
at a time in his Iife
when he's the most vulnerable.

35:12.577 --> 35:13.976
Thank you, Doctor.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.611
Mr. Stern?
I have no questions.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.947
This is Tyler's
first birthday.

35:25.022 --> 35:27.718
We squeezed 100 people
into the house.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.417
You've got
a Iot of pictures there.

35:29.494 --> 35:32.930
Tyler's been the center
of our Iives
since the day we got him.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.631
What kind of Iife
has he had with you?

35:36.200 --> 35:40.569
We don't have a Iot of money,
but he doesn't want
for anything.

35:41.239 --> 35:42.968
Especially our Iove.

35:43.474 --> 35:46.705
We've tried to be
the best parents we can.

35:46.911 --> 35:51.109
Mrs. BIake, did you know
12 years ago that
the adoption was not Iegal?

35:51.549 --> 35:53.779
Did you know
about the death
of Tyler's mother?

35:53.851 --> 35:55.148
Of course not.

35:55.219 --> 35:58.245
We did everything
Mr. Sanford told us to do.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.983
And now that you do know?

36:02.360 --> 36:05.090
We're terrified that we're
going to Iose Tyler.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.630
We can't imagine
being without him.

36:09.734 --> 36:13.898
PIease,
don't punish our family

36:13.971 --> 36:15.529
for someone else's crime.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.671
Thank you.

36:24.348 --> 36:28.409
I'm sorry for the tragedy
you and your husband
are going through right now.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.918
And Tyler. He's been
our son all his Iife.

36:31.989 --> 36:34.514
And you've done
a wonderful job raising him.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.221
Thank you.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.421
And can you imagine
how Mr. Cook feels then,

36:38.496 --> 36:41.795
all these years he Iost
not knowing Tyler was his son?

36:41.866 --> 36:45.802
Mr. Cook has other children.
Tyler is all we have.

36:46.237 --> 36:48.933
Mrs. BIake,
if your child was Iost,

36:49.006 --> 36:51.566
and a nice family took him in
and raised him well,

36:51.642 --> 36:54.975
and then you found him,
wouldn't you want him back?

37:00.184 --> 37:01.344
Yes.

37:03.087 --> 37:07.023
I wasn't there to give Tyler
the Iove and attention
the BIakes did,

37:07.091 --> 37:09.651
because I was robbed
of the chance.

37:10.094 --> 37:12.824
You're recently divorced,
you already have two sons.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.094
How can you convince
this court that you can
take care of a third child?

37:16.167 --> 37:18.635
Just Iook at what I've done
with my sons.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.735
Tyler would have
a brother his age,

37:21.806 --> 37:25.071
a devoted father
who could more than
provide for him.

37:25.943 --> 37:29.276
And he has his mother's
parents. I want them
to be a part of his Iife.

37:33.618 --> 37:37.486
Mr. Cook, Tyler has grown up
with a mother and father
who Iove him.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.456
Do you think his Iife
would improve
Iiving with you?

37:41.359 --> 37:45.625
I know I am now
a single parent.
I wish it were different,

37:46.597 --> 37:49.725
but Tyler
is my flesh and blood.

37:50.167 --> 37:52.067
You've spent time with Tyler.

37:52.236 --> 37:55.603
What do you think of the job
the BIakes have done
as parents?

37:57.475 --> 38:00.569
Just as good as I
could've ever done.

38:00.745 --> 38:03.043
Can you imagine, then,
what they must be
going through?

38:03.114 --> 38:07.244
You can't imagine
how hard it is for me
to make them go through it.

38:08.252 --> 38:11.415
You just finished
a bitter custody battle
with your ex-wife.

38:11.489 --> 38:14.947
She was seeking full custody
of your two sons,
is that correct?

38:17.595 --> 38:18.823
Yes.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.223
Mr. Cook,
how would you have felt
if she'd won,

38:21.299 --> 38:24.700
and you weren't able
to see your children
anytime you wanted?

38:27.471 --> 38:29.200
It would've crushed me.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.339
I'm sorry.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.778
How's it going?
Ripping my guts out.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.887
These are all good people.

38:44.021 --> 38:45.454
We finished talking
to the birthmothers

38:45.523 --> 38:47.718
who gave their babies
to Sanford for adoption.

38:47.792 --> 38:51.284
AII Iegit.
If Sanford stole babies,
we can't find them.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.794
Your faces tell me
there's more to this story.

38:54.899 --> 38:58.596
His ex-wife, Linda Cook,
gave birth to her oldest son
at Long Island Jewish

38:58.669 --> 39:01.263
a month before
Jennifer Talmadge
gave birth.

39:01.372 --> 39:04.466
Linda's hospital roommate
was a client of Sanford's.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.005
Says she recommended
Sanford to Linda.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.569
STABLER: We compared
Jennifer's signature
on the adoption papers

39:09.647 --> 39:13.014
to Linda Cook's signature
on the release forms
for her DNA.

39:14.251 --> 39:16.310
Let's get Linda Cook in here.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.978
LINDA: Robert and I
are divorced.

39:19.056 --> 39:22.321
Whether he gets
to keep his Iove child
has nothing to do with me.

39:22.393 --> 39:23.883
Why am I here?

39:24.028 --> 39:27.054
CRAGEN: 12 years ago,
Jennifer Talmadge wrote
a Ietter to your husband

39:27.131 --> 39:29.258
telling him
she was having his baby.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.796
So?

39:32.803 --> 39:36.500
Well, he never got it,
because you intercepted it.

39:37.441 --> 39:39.909
That's how you found out
about Jennifer.

39:40.578 --> 39:43.103
Is this some fantasy
you concocted?

39:43.180 --> 39:45.205
When you gave birth
to your son,

39:45.316 --> 39:49.412
why did you ask
your hospital roommate
about her adoption attorney?

39:49.520 --> 39:53.547
I knew Rob was fooling around
on me. I didn't know he'd
ask me to marry him.

39:53.624 --> 39:57.151
And when he did,
you realized it would
be better for everybody

39:57.228 --> 39:59.890
if your husband didn't know
he had a Iove child.

39:59.964 --> 40:02.194
Where are you
getting this from?

40:03.734 --> 40:06.828
Jennifer's signature
on the adoption papers.

40:10.107 --> 40:12.075
That's your handwriting.

40:13.611 --> 40:16.478
You get the Ietter,
you go to see Jennifer.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.616
Something happens.
She's dead.

40:20.117 --> 40:22.950
And now you're gonna find
some place for the baby,

40:23.087 --> 40:24.520
so you impersonate her

40:24.588 --> 40:27.853
and you give Stephen
to Mark Sanford for adoption.

40:29.593 --> 40:33.427
Now just tell me that you
didn't plan to kill her
and I can help you.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.996
I want a Iawyer.

40:45.843 --> 40:48.073
SERANI: Most of the children
who come through this court

40:48.145 --> 40:50.477
have nobody who wants
or Ioves them.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.679
This case is
so much more difficult,

40:53.751 --> 40:57.517
because all the parties
have only acted
in the child's best interest.

40:58.856 --> 41:02.383
Mr. Cook, it's clear
that you never intended
to abandon Tyler

41:02.460 --> 41:05.691
and that you're
more than suitable
to make a home for him.

41:06.230 --> 41:11.133
Mr. and Mrs. BIake,
you're Ioving,
excellent model parents,

41:11.569 --> 41:13.059
an example to follow.

41:15.506 --> 41:19.943
But the Iaw recognizes
the right of the
biological parent as paramount

41:20.010 --> 41:22.604
as Iong as that parent
is deemed fit.

41:23.747 --> 41:28.377
Therefore, I have no choice
but to award custody
of the child to Mr. Cook.

41:30.321 --> 41:34.519
Mr. Cook, I urge you
in the strongest
possible terms

41:34.592 --> 41:37.652
to continue to act
in Tyler's best interest

41:37.728 --> 41:39.889
with regards to his
adoptive parents.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.826
(GAVEL POUNDING)
We're adjourned.

41:52.643 --> 41:54.042
Tyler.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.705
We'II see you when you
come over to get your stuff,
okay, buddy?

42:15.533 --> 42:19.060
Prosecuting's easier.
At Ieast then you know
who the bad guy is.

42:20.671 --> 42:24.038
You okay?
They're talking. It's a start.
