DID YOU GUYS FIRE

00:09.922 --> 00:11.707
THAT HOT

00:11.750 --> 00:14.188
BECAUSE HE WAS
THE BEST PART
OF THIS PLACE.

KATE, I FINALLY
COME HOME FROM
A SEMESTER ABROAD,

00:26.069 --> 00:28.332
AND THIS IS
HOW YOU REACT?

00:28.376 --> 00:29.899
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT THEY CONVERTED

00:29.942 --> 00:31.901

00:31.944 --> 00:34.338

02:36.504 --> 02:38.636
IT WOULDN'T BE
OFFICIAL

02:38.680 --> 02:40.595
WITHOUT MAKING
A WISH.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.308
TO SEE MY SISTER
AND FATHER.

ERASED ALL TRACES
OF MY DAUGHTER.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.227
SHE'S GONE. DON'T MAKE
THE MISTAKE I MADE.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.751
IT'D BE A MISTAKE
TO NOT EVEN TRY TO
INTERROGATE ALICE.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.580
SO SHE CAN PRATTLE OFF
A BUNCH OF NONSENSICAL
NURSERY RHYMES?

03:52.623 --> 03:55.365
OR INCRIMINATE HERSELF.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.411
I APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT,
BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING

03:57.454 --> 03:58.977

OUT OF HER.

-IT'S TOO BIG A RISK.
-RISK OF WHAT?

WERE YOU PLANNING
ON TELLING ME THAT

04:12.861 --> 04:14.166
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:14.210 --> 04:15.864
SHE SHOWED UP
AT MY OFFICE JUST NOW.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.258
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.520
SHE'S BEEN
IN A HOLDING CELL

04:19.563 --> 04:20.825
FOR THE LAST 8 HOURS.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.305
IS THAT A LIVE FEED?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.351
YES, WITH TWO GUARDS
AT THE DOOR.

SHE'S DOWNSTAIRS.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

SAW HER.

OFF THE MESSENGER BAG

THEY'RE AN EXACT MATCH
FOR ALICE'S PRINTS

04:43.195 --> 04:44.806
IN THE CROWS' DATABASE.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.590
AND LOOK.
THERE'S MORE.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.027
I FOUND THIS
IN HER WALLET.

04:49.071 --> 04:51.116
NOW IT'S
NOT IN THE SYSTEM,

04:51.160 --> 04:53.205
BUT THAT IS HANDS DOWN
THE BEST FAKE I.D.
I'VE EVER SEEN.

A LOT OF TROUBLE.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.296

A 300-PAGE DISSERTATION

04:59.429 --> 05:03.303
ON "THEORETICAL EXTRAGALACTIC
ASTROPHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY."

WITH A SECURITY CODE,

05:07.481 --> 05:09.483

CRACK IT IN A COUPLE HOURS.

-HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.144

COULD EVER REMEMBER.

OK.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.723
I DON'T KNOW.

05:32.767 --> 05:36.074

REALLY CLOSE.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.815
WE SHOULD TELL
YOUR DAD
ABOUT THIS.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.556
NO. NOT UNTIL WE FIGURE
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.341
-UH-UH.
-WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

FIGURE IT OUT,
LET ME KNOW.

LIKE THIS BEFORE

ON THIS ONE,

AND NOT ALICE?

OF ALL THAT.

STILL, I MEAN, THIS WORLD
HAS GOT TO BE

TO THIS ONE,

OF REQUESTS,

HAVE DISOWNED YOU.

HE WAS OUR DAD.

WHEN WE WERE 13
DRIVING BACK
FROM OUR BAT MITZVAH,

11:15.675 --> 11:17.459

OFF A BRIDGE.
