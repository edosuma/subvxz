00:10.520 --> 00:11.749
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:11.920 --> 00:14.310
Harrison and I are
leaving Miami with Hannah.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.312
You act like this
doesn't even affect me.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.556
You can visit.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.076
I'll look you up
the next time I'm in Argentina.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.074
So you any closer
in your search for Saxon?

00:23.280 --> 00:25.590
I wish we could just leave.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.160
I still have feelings for you.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.959
I used to feel like something
was holding me back.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.634
- Now?
- Now, I--

00:32.320 --> 00:34.755
I want you to help me
like you helped Dexter.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.480
- I'll find a way.
- What about Dexter? He's still after me.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.716
I'll talk to Dexter.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.360
You don't think he likes killing.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.950
Let me show you how much
he doesn't like killing.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.793
<i>No!</i>

00:44.960 --> 00:47.077
That's Zach's head
he's sawing into.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.357
I'd like to be a part of the team
on this one.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.399
Thanks, but the Marshal Service
doesn't take on partners.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.279
Looking for a new forensic tech?

00:54.440 --> 00:56.875
- Dexter's moving on.
- Really?

00:57.040 --> 00:59.509
It just struck me as odd
that he's leaving town...

00:59.680 --> 01:02.320
...at the same time
Hannah McKay is rumoured to be here.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.233
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay,
I would know about it.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.676
Deputy Marshal Clayton
thinks Dexter's hiding you.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.314
Oh, God.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.392
- What happened?
- He fell and hit his chin.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.631
It's a deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.872
Hello, Dexter.
Mother chose the wrong son.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.598
Evelyn?

03:32.840 --> 03:36.629
<i>Vogel warned me
I've been straddling two worlds...</i>

03:37.800 --> 03:40.076
<i>...and I ignored her.</i>

03:40.280 --> 03:43.478
<i>For that, she paid the price
with her life.</i>

03:45.320 --> 03:49.030
<i>Now I have to remove myself
from her life.</i>

04:12.760 --> 04:16.834
<i>I never imagined the last homicide
I'd work would be one I'm now a part of.</i>

04:18.360 --> 04:20.750
<i>I have to call this in.</i>

04:21.839 --> 04:24.878
<i>I can't be seen
leaving the scene of the crime.</i>

04:36.160 --> 04:38.550
<i>The last time I was in a pool
of my mother's blood...</i>

04:38.720 --> 04:41.076
<i>...I was too young
to do anything about it.</i>

04:41.240 --> 04:43.118
<i>But I'm no longer a child.</i>

04:47.040 --> 04:50.920
She didn't say
why she wanted me to stop by.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.312
The two of you were friends?
Your father knew her, right?

04:54.520 --> 04:57.194
Yeah, she reached out
to both Deb and me.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.039
She was a good person.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.953
So you pull up to the house.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.318
- You see the door kicked in--
- And I ran in. That's when I found her.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.470
You moved the body?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.757
Yes.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.754
I tried to stem the bleeding,
but she was already gone.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.479
Did you see anybody suspicious?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.552
Miller was talking to the neighbours.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.280
One of them saw a white male
in his 40s take off...

05:18.440 --> 05:21.399
...in a white or grey pickup.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.119
- Which is it?
- It was dark.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.431
That's the best
they could make out.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.394
Give Miller a hand,
and canvass the whole block.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.758
Updates every half hour.
The media's gonna be all over this.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.434
Okay.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.199
- You should go.
- No, I can help.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.033
Dex.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.793
As much as I could use
the hand...

05:39.960 --> 05:41.155
...a defence attorney
would have a field day...

05:41.360 --> 05:44.159
...with a forensic tech
who not only found a murder...

05:44.360 --> 05:45.953
...but knew the victim
and then worked it.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.476
We gotta protect the case here.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.676
So I'll see you first thing
in the morning.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.077
Last day on the job.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.119
Last day.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.839
- I should--
- Go. We got this.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.076
All right.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.392
<i>Saxon may have a head start,
but I intend to catch up.</i>

06:09.240 --> 06:11.914
Jesus, what are you doing here
so early?

06:12.120 --> 06:13.315
Is Harrison with Hannah?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.676
Yeah, she's helping him
get dressed in my room.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.991
That kid wakes
before the fucking sun.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.193
You all right?

06:23.760 --> 06:26.036
Evelyn's dead.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.593
Saxon killed her last night
in front of me.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.350
He got away.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.958
- Fuck.
- I wanted you to hear it from me.

06:35.160 --> 06:39.120
Miami Metro is working the case.
It's all over the news.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.877
Jesus Christ. You all right?

06:47.760 --> 06:50.036
- Evelyn was...
- I know.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.195
If it weren't for her--

06:55.360 --> 06:57.795
We might not have found
our way back to each other.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.640
If Saxon's out there...

07:04.800 --> 07:08.396
...Harrison needs to be with Jamie.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.878
She's back at Batista's.
He'll be safe there.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.000
Are you gonna go after Saxon?

07:15.440 --> 07:17.272
Yes.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.031
Then I will too. I'll call Batista.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.634
I'll go back to work today.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.393
She was important to me too, Dex.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.951
You're putting yourself in the same
position you've been trying to avoid.

07:28.120 --> 07:32.558
Understand this: if I get Saxon my way,
I'm not handing him over to you.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.599
Daddy, I combed my hair.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.679
I see that.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.115
He insisted.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.796
I think Jamie's gonna be really
impressed. Go grab your backpack.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.317
- She's waiting for us at the apartment.
- I'll help you.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.594
Don't tell her
I already had a doughnut.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.752
- What's this?
- I booked our itinerary.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.640
The three of us fly to Rio.
When we get to South America...

08:02.800 --> 08:05.235
...we catch a flight to Buenos Aires.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.517
And no one can trace us.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.036
That's still the plan, right?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.394
Yeah.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.677
- But...
- What?

08:15.760 --> 08:18.992
Dr. Vogel's dead.
Saxon killed her.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.471
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.313
This doesn't change anything
for us...

08:24.520 --> 08:27.354
...but I need to make sure
it's taken care of before we leave.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.160
You think you can
take care of it that fast?

08:30.960 --> 08:32.996
Yes.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.836
<i>Two days left in Miami.</i>

08:41.039 --> 08:43.077
<i>Two days to find Saxon.</i>

08:43.240 --> 08:45.516
<i>Two days until I start
a new life with Hannah.</i>

08:45.680 --> 08:47.478
Good news.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.429
I already have five people
coming by to see your place today.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.795
That was fast.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.998
Market's coming back.
And with a location like yours...

08:56.160 --> 08:59.073
...I wouldn't be surprised
if we end up with five offers.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.631
I really appreciate you taking
the listing on such short notice, Syl.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.918
Course.
I was happy to get the call.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.353
Oh, Harrison's gotten so big.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.159
Yeah.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.473
So why the sudden move?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.631
Too many memories.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.395
I understand.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.631
After Miguel...

09:26.520 --> 09:30.070
I downsized.
Focused on the kids.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.279
Oh, make that six people
coming by.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.596
I should take this.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.359
Okay.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.794
You put monkey in a box.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.792
Oh, sorry about that.

09:47.960 --> 09:53.638
God, seeing your place all boxed up
is making this so real.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.230
You guys are really going.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.631
Harrison is gonna miss you.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.315
Monkey's gonna miss you too.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.836
Hey, why don't you take
Harrison overnight?

10:05.040 --> 10:08.238
Deb's place is so cramped, and people
are gonna be in and out of here.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.629
And that way, you can--

10:09.800 --> 10:13.237
Hug my favourite person
in the whole wide world all night long!

10:13.400 --> 10:14.959
Stop!

10:16.840 --> 10:17.990
All right.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.436
- This one.
- This one, oh.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.599
Oh, yeah. Looks pretty.

10:25.760 --> 10:29.549
I'd like to get her inland
before Laura hits.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.076
- Laura?
- Tropical Storm Laura.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.358
They say she'll make landfall
in a few days.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.556
She's a 2001 Century 2901
centre console.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.916
I had this custom rail put in.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.600
New paint.

10:47.760 --> 10:52.471
Has a radar, GPS,
fish-finder, autopilot...

10:52.640 --> 10:54.552
...emergency life raft.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.351
And I had these twin Yamaha 250
four-stroke motors put in.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.477
They got just over 400 hours...

11:01.680 --> 11:05.390
...and when you open them up
and you're out there...

11:06.840 --> 11:08.718
There's nothing like it.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.393
Hoping she'd have
a bigger beer cooler.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.634
Well, maybe she's not
the boat for you.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.991
<i>Saxon moves from city to city...</i>

11:29.160 --> 11:30.480
<i>...but his job never changes.</i>

11:30.640 --> 11:33.360
<i>He inspects buildings.
It's a place to start.</i>

11:35.680 --> 11:37.592
- Good morning.
- Easy for you to say.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.917
You didn't spend the night
scouring Vogel's place...

11:40.080 --> 11:42.549
...with nothing to show for it
except a big goose egg.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.155
Nothing?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.596
See for yourself.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.835
No prints, no trace.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.959
Oh, man, I could go for some hookers
and some blow right now.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.636
But since this isn't the '90s,
caffeine it is.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.837
- Want anything?
- No, I'm good.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.478
<i>This hospital, closed for years.</i>

12:12.000 --> 12:15.755
<i>Saxon issued a demolition permit,
but it's still standing.</i>

12:16.680 --> 12:19.673
<i>The perfect place to cut
into your victims' skulls.</i>

12:21.080 --> 12:23.231
Hey, Dexter,
Quinn is looking for you.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.193
- Because?
- Oh, yeah.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.080
The swab thing
in the interrogation room.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.040
Okay.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.753
Dex, come in.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.313
Hi, Dexter.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.071
He came in to clear his name
on the Cassie case.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.640
I see.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.520
I had no idea I was a suspect.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.117
We got to your apartment,
and it was totally cleaned out.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.352
You can appreciate how that looks.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.357
I couldn't stay at my old place.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.832
I spent so much time there
with Cassie.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.194
Everywhere I looked,
something reminded me of her.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.238
You can understand that.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.960
You knew Cassie.
She was a great person.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.673
Yes, she was.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.077
For a while...

13:23.800 --> 13:26.520
...I was even thinking
of leaving Miami.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.512
But my business is here...

13:30.680 --> 13:33.479
...my friends, family.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.117
When I heard there was
an alert out for me, I...

13:41.280 --> 13:44.751
I couldn't believe it.
I thought we already resolved this.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.354
We appreciate you coming in.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.716
Like you said,
I just wanna clear my name.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.317
Good. This will help towards that.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.596
What's this?

13:53.760 --> 13:56.150
- DNA sample.
- Is that really necessary?

13:56.560 --> 13:59.394
- You said you wanted to cooperate.
- Open.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.674
Thanks. We're done here for now.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.993
Hey, you plan on any more moves--

14:23.160 --> 14:26.153
- I'll be sure to let you know.
- Good.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.717
Saxon was just here, trying to
clear his name for Cassie's murder.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.634
He had an answer for everything
Quinn threw at him.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.076
Well, he's got balls, I'll give him that.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.749
Masuka find anything to tie him
to Vogel's crime scene?

14:50.920 --> 14:52.752
He came up empty, but...

14:52.920 --> 14:54.320
What?

14:54.480 --> 14:57.314
- Saxon agreed to a standard.
- Well, so what?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.949
It's not gonna tie him
to Cassie's murder.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.114
But it'll give us a matri-fucking-lineal
match to his mother.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.272
Yeah, suddenly he's no longer
Oliver Saxon.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.080
He's Daniel Vogel,
Dr. Vogel's psychopathic son...

15:10.240 --> 15:13.312
...who died in a fire
at a psychiatric hospital.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.279
Let him try to explain that away
with my boot up his ass.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.951
Let me ask you a question.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.594
Why are you helping us get Saxon?

15:26.480 --> 15:28.312
Don't you want him for yourself?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.030
I just want him taken care of.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.840
Well, that's new coming from you.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.478
I'm gonna go get started on this.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.155
I'm gonna go find some pens.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.954
Hi.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.160
Your Thin Mints are
in the bottom drawer.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.597
It takes supply requisition
like a week to come through, so...

16:05.760 --> 16:06.796
- Right.
- You mind?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.514
By all means, go ahead.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.558
Thanks.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.871
What the fuck is this?

16:20.840 --> 16:24.356
I kept it around
just in case I decided...

16:24.520 --> 16:26.318
...to marry somebody else from work.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.314
You've had this in here
the whole time?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.997
Keep my stapler away from Soderquist.
Guy's a fucking klepto.

17:00.440 --> 17:04.638
<i>Is this old hospital
Saxon's private sanatorium?</i>

18:26.920 --> 18:28.912
Saxon's kill room.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.714
Zach died here.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.116
And who knows how many others?

18:37.080 --> 18:39.675
Doesn't look like
Saxon's been living here.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.399
But he'll be back.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.597
This is clearly a special place
for him.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.195
You can stake out the building,
wait for him.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.079
I don't have time to wait.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.072
Hannah and I
don't have time to wait.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.709
- I want him dead.
- By your hand.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.111
Anyone's hand,
as long as he's dead.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.791
That doesn't sound
like the old Dexter.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.395
Maybe I'm not the old Dexter.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.754
Everything Saxon downloaded
about me from Vogel's computer...

19:26.920 --> 19:29.071
...is on this.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.795
He recorded all his kills.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.998
They're all here.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.954
But you still don't know
where he is.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.794
Maybe this is exactly what I need.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.437
I can bring him to me.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.398
Hey.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.359
You calling it quits soon?

19:56.520 --> 19:57.954
Yeah, I will soon.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.271
I just wanna get up to speed
on a couple things.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.238
Going to Dr. Vogel's memorial
tomorrow?

20:02.400 --> 20:03.959
I know she helped you
get through a lot.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.318
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Need a ride, let me know.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.357
Swung by Elway's.
He said you were back on the force.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.399
Yeah. It's my first day back.
I'm kind of swamped.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.392
What can I help you with,
deputy marshal?

20:23.560 --> 20:25.836
I was hoping you could
clear something up for me.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.231
- I'm just following up on a lead.
- Shoot.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.120
A blond woman matching
Hannah McKay's description...

20:31.280 --> 20:34.478
...walked into urgent care with
a young boy named Harrison Morgan...

20:34.640 --> 20:36.313
...said she was his mother.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.791
The weird part is
she gave your name and address.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.593
My nephew's been staying with me...

20:43.800 --> 20:45.792
...since Dexter put his condo
on the market.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.670
He busted his chin, and I took him in
to get him stitched up.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.752
So you took him to urgent care?

20:51.920 --> 20:55.311
I told the woman at the desk I was
his aunt, but maybe she didn't hear me.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.671
Still, she looked at my photo
of Hannah McKay...

20:57.840 --> 20:59.513
...and swore
that's who brought him in.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.911
Then she needs to get
her fucking eyes checked...

21:02.080 --> 21:06.438
...because I haven't been blond
since a very bad freshman year.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.195
Right, okay.
Well, look, you know what it's like.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.159
I gotta check out all the leads,
even the crazy ones, right?

21:12.320 --> 21:13.549
Sure.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.800
All right, welcome back, detective.
I'll be in touch.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.677
I'll be here.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.913
Not much turnout. I guess
she didn't have many family or friends.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.231
Yeah, just the son
who slit her throat.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.319
Think Saxon's watching?

21:37.520 --> 21:39.512
I would be.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.440
Thank you, everyone, for coming.
I know most of you...

21:43.600 --> 21:46.718
...didn't know Evelyn very well, but...

21:46.880 --> 21:49.520
- It was a nice service.
- Yeah.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.672
It's important to remember
those no longer with us.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.354
Yeah.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.476
Now, who wants a drink?

22:06.040 --> 22:08.794
Christ. I'll be right back.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.514
You know they're really
gonna miss you, right?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.992
I know.

22:23.720 --> 22:27.077
Maybe you should go in there and
pretend you're gonna miss them too.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.749
It's your last day, you know?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.880
<i>It's no longer pretend.</i>

22:32.040 --> 22:35.590
Well, gain a Morgan,
lose a Morgan.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.631
Harry would have been proud
of the two of you.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.152
Thank you, sir.

22:41.320 --> 22:45.951
I want you to know both of you
have been like family to me.

22:46.120 --> 22:50.956
And, Dexter, if you ever need anything
or decide you wanna come back...

22:51.120 --> 22:52.679
...this will always be your home.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.671
I appreciate that.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.032
So let me buy you another round.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.318
- I should probably get going.
- Oh, nonsense.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.876
For the next six hours,
you're still working for me.

23:04.040 --> 23:06.999
You're not going anywhere.
That's an order. Come on.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.795
Okay, missy, what's your poison?

23:10.840 --> 23:13.150
I'll have a Diet Coke.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.198
A beer for me. Thanks.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.831
Well, that's a little tame.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.271
Really? Are you gonna go there?

23:21.440 --> 23:23.318
Well, if you put it that way, no.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.040
Okay, you were all up in my shit
about a bong rip...

23:26.200 --> 23:29.318
...but I don't know if you've noticed,
but we're in a bar.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.392
Look, I'm sorry
about the whole pot thing.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.110
You know, this whole father-daughter
thing is still kind of new, you know?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.397
Yeah, I know. It's cool.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.431
Everybody's really excited about
your sister being back on the force.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.839
Yeah, she told me
that you two might be...

23:48.000 --> 23:49.719
...back in each other's lives.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.318
You okay with that?

23:53.840 --> 23:57.151
Deb likes you, and with me gone...

23:59.120 --> 24:01.874
I don't want her to be alone.

24:02.080 --> 24:06.677
I want her to be with someone
who makes her happy.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.075
That's all I ever wanted to do.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.152
I'm okay with that.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.992
I gotta take this.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.915
- Hey, Syl, what's up?
- Dex, I'm so glad I caught you.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.596
I know it's last-minute but I've got
somebody who wants to see the place...

24:28.760 --> 24:33.789
<i>...wants to meet the seller,
and he's ready to make an offer, cash.</i>

24:34.960 --> 24:37.794
- Give me half an hour.
<i>- Perfect.</i>

24:42.360 --> 24:45.080
You remember
the first case we worked?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.071
Husband, wife, lots of blood.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.038
I'd never seen anything like it.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.193
The strings. The look on your face.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.033
You were like a pig in shit.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.433
Thanks, I think.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.113
Not sure what this place
is gonna be like without you.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.752
You're a good friend, Angel.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.640
I'm glad to hear you say that.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.632
So you'll forgive me for this.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.520
All right, everybody!
Everybody, come on, gather around.

25:16.680 --> 25:21.960
Gather around. I know that
this is a solemn occasion.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.949
But since somebody didn't
let me throw him a party...

25:26.840 --> 25:29.150
...let's let this be it.

25:29.720 --> 25:34.920
Dexter Morgan may be leaving
the Miami Metro <i>familia...</i>

25:35.320 --> 25:39.109
...but he will always be
right here in our hearts.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.832
To Dexter.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.678
We wish you and Harrison luck
in whatever comes next.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.036
- To Dexter.
- To Dexter.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.511
Thank you. Thank you.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.556
I'll miss you guys too.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.917
Dexter.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.398
This is Oliver Saxon.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.594
<i>Again.</i>

26:16.880 --> 26:20.556
He responded to the listing and was
hoping to take a look at the place.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.956
- Pleasure.
- Likewise.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.600
You'll have to excuse the mess.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.594
No problem. They say moving's
one of the big causes of stress.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.229
Almost as much as divorce.
And death.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.957
Why don't you follow me?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.598
So it's a one bedroom, one bathroom,
but it has an attached--

26:37.800 --> 26:41.316
Would you mind if Dexter showed me?
I like to hear directly from the owner.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.119
No sales pitch.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.909
Sure.

26:46.120 --> 26:49.636
I have a few phone calls to return.
I'll be outside.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.512
I always did like this place.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.438
You have the same view Cassie did.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.557
What are you doing here?

27:01.760 --> 27:03.672
I have a proposal.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.833
Figured the safest way
to deliver it was to bring a referee.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.998
I'm listening.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.992
We walk away.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.834
- Walk away?
- Both of us.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.279
From each other.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.000
Go our separate paths,
live our separate lives.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.237
I forget about you.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.914
You forget about me.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.234
You went out of your way
to kill your mother in front of me...

27:28.400 --> 27:30.153
...and you just expect me to forget?

27:30.320 --> 27:32.232
May have been
a little bit over-the-top...

27:32.400 --> 27:34.278
...but I was only trying
to make a point.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.237
I missed the point.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.553
It was a test to see if,
given the chance...

27:41.760 --> 27:43.956
...she would finally choose me.

27:44.120 --> 27:48.239
Well, we both know
how that turned out.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.593
Yeah, so naturally,
you had to cut her throat.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.878
You know what it's like. The kill.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.679
It can be cathartic.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.718
And it was.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.349
That's why
I'm giving you a choice.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.399
Go on with your life,
or come after me.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.636
But choose poorly, like Mom...

28:12.240 --> 28:14.152
...and you will lose.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.315
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.592
You have a lot more to lose
than I do.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.077
You've created the perfect cover life.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.831
Cute little son, your sister.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.511
Stepkids even.

28:33.680 --> 28:38.914
And now you have a girlfriend.
It's Hannah, right?

28:40.480 --> 28:42.790
<i>They're not a cover.
They're real to me.</i>

28:42.960 --> 28:44.713
<i>Something Saxon can't understand.</i>

28:44.880 --> 28:48.191
All very lovely.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.797
And all very easy
to remove from your life.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.473
I mean, you've already had
one wife murdered.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.677
That must be an interesting story.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.715
But it's gonna put you
in a very awkward position...

29:03.880 --> 29:07.396
...if everyone else starts
disappearing from your life.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.872
The choice is yours.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.195
Yeah, I think I can live with that.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.554
I'll let Mrs. Prado know
I've put an offer on the table.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.757
<i>He wants me to walk away
without realising...</i>

29:35.960 --> 29:38.680
<i>...he's just reminded me why I can't.</i>

29:41.160 --> 29:44.153
So, what's so urgent?

29:44.320 --> 29:48.633
I've got a line on Hannah McKay, but
I'm gonna need your help reeling her in.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.998
- I thought you didn't want my help.
- Been looking at the wrong Morgan.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.318
I think your former employee
has her holed up in her place.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.634
Deb is no fan of Hannah McKay.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.190
Yeah, but you said she'd
do anything for her brother.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.119
Helping McKay is helping him.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.358
I just need you to talk to her,
take a look around.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.359
Look, Deb and I didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.671
If you're still interested
in that reward...

30:13.840 --> 30:16.719
...I suggest you find a way
to patch things up with her.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.230
Hey.

30:26.440 --> 30:30.798
Just trying to make our last
few days in Miami special, you know?

30:30.960 --> 30:33.191
I hope you like dolmas.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.189
I'm just trying to keep myself busy.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.952
You should go on one
of those cooking shows.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.351
The competition ones. You'd win.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.910
Oh, I'd make sure that I did.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.515
- It's Elway.
- Bedroom.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.430
What's up, Elway?

31:03.600 --> 31:07.071
Security left a couple of your
personal items back in the office.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.471
Just a couple pictures and a hat.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.752
You didn't have to bring them
over here. I could've picked them up.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.230
Well, I actually wanted
to talk to you.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.518
- May I?
- Actually, now is not a very good time.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.512
It'll just take a minute.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.560
I wanted to apologise
about the way I behaved when you left.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.279
Don't worry about it.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.238
No, no, I was a real asshole.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.711
I let my ego get the best of me,
and I don't want to leave it like that.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.190
I-- Well, I want us
to be friends, you know?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.317
Great. Well, then we're good.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.800
Now you're back on the force.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.560
Maybe you and I can do
each other the occasional favour.

31:40.720 --> 31:42.439
Yeah, we'll keep in touch.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.520
You--

31:44.680 --> 31:46.114
You expecting company?

31:46.280 --> 31:48.590
I sure am, and I actually need
to get ready. So...

31:51.200 --> 31:53.510
I guess the police department is
paying better than I remember.

31:53.720 --> 31:57.350
Hey, Elway, I really appreciate that
apology, but I've got a lot of shit to do.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.677
Could you kindly get
the fuck out of my house?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.672
Yeah.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.759
- He's gone, but he's onto you.
- Oh, shit.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.958
The deputy marshal won't be far
behind. You've gotta move fast.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.200
Hello?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.875
Dex, we have a problem.
Elway was just here.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.680
- Elway?
<i>- He was dropping by to talk with Deb...</i>

32:30.880 --> 32:34.669
...but she's sure he was looking for me.
She thinks that he knows that I'm here.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.750
Stay there.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.440
Okay.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.157
I tried to get an earlier flight,
but it's booked because of the storm.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.953
I'm getting out of here right now.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.032
She's gonna stay at a hotel
near the airport until your flight.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.756
- Saxon came to my apartment.
- What? Why the fuck didn't you call me?

32:57.920 --> 33:01.357
It happened very fast.
He said he wanted to offer me a truce.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.115
- A truce?
- Really it was just a veiled threat.

33:04.280 --> 33:07.432
He threatened you, Harrison,
Astor and Cody, and you.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.512
I can handle
whatever he throws at me.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.558
- You should go with Hannah.
- Yes.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.713
I deposited my money into an offshore
account. We can access it immediately.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.270
The storm coming
is gonna ground all the flights.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.239
- Saxon isn't gonna follow us.
- What if he does?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.798
I get it. I get that this is something
you feel like you have to do...

33:24.960 --> 33:27.031
- ...this is who you are--
- It's not who I wanna be.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.994
I have to do this first.
There's no other way.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.833
I will be there.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.591
I guess this is goodbye.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.073
For now.

33:51.160 --> 33:54.631
I can't not see
my brother and my nephew.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.875
Now you're a part of that package.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.598
Well, not anything I ever saw coming.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.116
For what it's worth, I think Dexter's
making a mistake going after Saxon.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.795
I think he should be here
with you now.

34:10.239 --> 34:12.550
Have you ever known him
to be able to walk away...

34:12.719 --> 34:14.871
...from something
once he's started it?

34:15.800 --> 34:18.713
That's life with Dexter.
That's who he is.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.792
It's like having a whole other
person in the relationship.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.353
I must really love this man.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.272
Me too.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.870
Even when I don't want to.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.476
Take care of them.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.271
Yeah, I will.

34:59.200 --> 35:02.238
<i>Saxon wants to make Miami
his home.</i>

35:02.400 --> 35:04.915
<i>Little does he know
how hot the summers can get.</i>

35:12.200 --> 35:16.353
<i>And once everyone sees the footage
of him as the Brain Surgeon...</i>

35:16.520 --> 35:18.159
<i>...the heat will be unbearable.</i>

35:18.320 --> 35:20.994
You know, he's not just gonna
walk away from that.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.799
Exactly.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.077
I'm drawing him to me.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.914
So I guess you're not gonna
accept his offer.

35:28.600 --> 35:32.879
Did you believe him,
that he's willing to disengage?

35:33.040 --> 35:35.077
You clearly don't.

35:35.240 --> 35:38.551
He came into my house
and threatened my family.

35:39.520 --> 35:42.718
Now you're sounding like
the old Dexter again.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.993
No, this is a different kind of kill.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.396
Dead is dead, Dex.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.711
It didn't used to matter
who was on my table...

35:51.920 --> 35:53.912
...as long as someone was, but now--

35:54.080 --> 35:55.116
It's personal.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.679
It's been personal for a long time.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.675
And that need you used to feel?

36:04.880 --> 36:08.271
It's still there, somewhere.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.711
But since Hannah came into my life...

36:11.880 --> 36:14.520
...it's lessened.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.637
What I need...

36:17.120 --> 36:19.032
...is her.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.749
So when you get to Argentina,
what happens?

36:24.800 --> 36:26.154
I don't know.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.715
But I can't wait to find out.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.231
Sorry. Dad said you were
waiting for this DNA stuff?

36:37.400 --> 36:38.800
Tell your dad thanks.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.236
It's so weird Masuka's your father.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.392
Weird awesome.

36:45.720 --> 36:48.360
You're not gonna fucking
believe this.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.192
Saxon is related to Vogel.
He's her son.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.559
You're kidding me.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.279
I thought all her family was dead.

36:56.920 --> 37:00.596
You think this fucker killed
his mother along with Cassie?

37:05.040 --> 37:06.190
What are you doing here?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.840
Starving.

37:09.120 --> 37:13.239
Saxon's DNA came back,
so they put out a warrant for his arrest.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.756
Miami Metro knows
that Saxon is Vogel's son...

37:15.960 --> 37:19.351
...and Elway and Clayton have
no idea where Hannah is.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.911
This is your last night in Miami,
and we are having dinner together.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.076
Even though you've already
packed up your kitchen.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.277
You wanna help me find
a plate and some pans?

37:28.440 --> 37:30.909
- I'm really not hungry.
- The next time we do this...

37:31.080 --> 37:33.754
...it's gonna be
fucking tacos and tequila.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.037
Or whatever the fuck they eat
in Argentina.

37:36.200 --> 37:39.796
Yeah, it'll probably be steaks.
It's Argentina, not Mexico.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.633
Deb, you shouldn't be here.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.031
Bullshit. Do you remember
where you put the pans?

37:44.240 --> 37:45.879
Listen to me. You can't be here.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.550
Why?

37:51.480 --> 37:55.110
- What the fuck is going on?
- I'm expecting company.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.079
Saxon.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.309
Just leave him to me.
And I mean leave.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.880
After everything you've been through,
I don't want--

38:07.040 --> 38:08.474
Listen to me.

38:08.680 --> 38:12.196
Nothing, and I mean nothing...

38:12.360 --> 38:16.320
...is gonna stand in the way of me
having one more night with my brother.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.830
Now, are you gonna help me
find that fucking skillet or what?

38:46.080 --> 38:47.639
This place has been wiped clean.

38:47.840 --> 38:50.230
Almost clean. Look at this.

38:50.400 --> 38:54.030
The last site someone visited on this
computer was for an Aero Sudamerica.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.954
Any specific details?
Did she book a flight?

38:57.120 --> 39:00.238
If she did, it's not here.
But I'll tell you what I can do.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.796
Access manifests for flights
in the next few days...

39:02.960 --> 39:05.111
...cross-check those names
with passport photos.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.471
- Not exactly legal.
- Are you saying don't do it?

39:07.640 --> 39:10.633
I'm not saying anything. While you do
whatever you're gonna do...

39:10.800 --> 39:13.360
...I'm gonna tail the Morgans,
see if they'll lead me to her.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.352
Done and done.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.798
How are Astor and Cody
doing with the move?

39:20.000 --> 39:23.960
They're better now that I told them
they could come down for Christmas...

39:24.120 --> 39:27.033
...and that Astor could have my SUV.

39:27.200 --> 39:31.274
You think you could drive it up to her?
She asked about you.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.797
Yeah, as soon as the storm passes.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.350
They're saying it might
turn into a hurricane.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.871
It's one of the few things
I won't miss about Florida.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.238
God, this is such a mindfuck.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.556
After tomorrow, you're not gonna be
here. What the fuck does that look like?

39:51.320 --> 39:54.358
We both start over.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.031
Is that even possible?

39:58.280 --> 40:01.000
Yeah, I think so.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.153
Don't you?

40:04.080 --> 40:08.393
It's just every fucked up--

40:12.920 --> 40:16.880
Every time I've been a complete mess,
you've been there for me.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.840
Even when it was your fault
that I was fucked up...

40:21.000 --> 40:23.117
...you've never given up on me.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.509
So if I can't make this work...

40:27.840 --> 40:31.231
...going back to being a cop again,
then who the fuck is gonna help me...

40:31.400 --> 40:33.392
...pick up the pieces of that?

40:33.560 --> 40:36.120
You're not that person anymore.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.112
You're stronger than that.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.715
You're stronger than I'll ever be.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.758
I'm not.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.391
Deb, Dad and Vogel
gave me the code...

40:46.560 --> 40:49.678
...so I'd know the right thing to do,
but you've always...

40:50.880 --> 40:53.156
...just known.

40:54.240 --> 40:57.312
It's the compass
I always wished I had.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.200
And as long as you listen to that...

41:01.360 --> 41:03.317
...you won't need me.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.113
You'll be fine.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.319
Maybe.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.790
But don't ever think
that it was the code...

41:15.960 --> 41:18.350
...that made you a good brother.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.074
There's a human being in there.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.355
There always has been.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.200
Even if you can't see it.

41:34.120 --> 41:38.080
<i>Miami Metro is seeking the public's help
in locating a local man, Oliver Saxon...</i>

41:38.240 --> 41:40.755
<i>...in connection with a string
of grisly recordings...</i>

41:40.920 --> 41:43.276
<i>...that were recently obtained
by Channel 8 News.</i>

41:43.440 --> 41:44.510
<i>Miami--</i>

41:47.920 --> 41:51.994
Did you help them
recently obtain that footage?

41:52.760 --> 41:57.039
I needed him to be a wanted man
and force his hand.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.916
If he wants to take a last stab at me,
now he has to do it tonight.

42:02.720 --> 42:06.600
Which I why I need you
to get out of here, Deb.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.353
Please.

42:12.120 --> 42:16.319
<i>Bringing him in for questioning
is still the department's top priority.</i>

42:16.480 --> 42:18.711
<i>Miami Metro is seeking

Fucking Dexter.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.590
Freeze, motherfucker.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.200
I'll take it from here.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.120
Thanks, Deb.

43:55.320 --> 43:57.312
Welcome home.

43:58.840 --> 44:02.390
I guess this means you've
decided against the truce.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.916
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.316
It's your own fault.

44:07.480 --> 44:10.518
You should've walked away,
left Miami when you could.

44:11.320 --> 44:15.200
I like this place. Miami's a great city.

44:15.360 --> 44:18.910
I love the Cuban food.
Nice weather.

44:19.080 --> 44:22.039
Murder solve rate
at about 20 percent.

44:23.040 --> 44:24.918
Yeah.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.437
I understand.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.116
There was a time
I wasn't willing to leave either.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.397
I didn't wanna give up anything.

44:36.920 --> 44:39.389
Sounds like something's changed.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.399
It has.

44:42.560 --> 44:44.677
Your girlfriend?

44:45.360 --> 44:46.476
Yeah, that's part of it.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.675
I've never been good
at relationships.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.311
Longest was a couple of weeks
and she was chained to my radiator...

44:54.480 --> 44:58.110
- ...so I guess that doesn't much count.
- Not really, no.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.273
Too much anger towards women,
I suppose.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.151
I can thank my mother for that.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.915
No, that's all on you.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.515
Well, I wish you luck.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.718
Hope you don't stab her
in the heart while she sleeps.

45:19.880 --> 45:24.272
No, Oliver, I like her.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.437
I love her.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.875
I think about her all the time.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.630
I'm thinking about her right now.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.440
How I'd rather be with her
than here with you.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.719
What?

45:48.840 --> 45:51.036
This is usually
my favourite moment...

45:51.480 --> 45:53.551
...the kill.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.556
The moment before the kill,
the kill itself...

45:56.720 --> 45:58.757
...the moment right after.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.238
But now I don't even wanna be here.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.513
I'm feeling a much stronger pull.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.756
I don't need to kill you.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.917
Then don't.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.037
Walk away.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.953
I will.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.391
I guess I'll live to see another day.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.069
Oh, no, you're still gonna die.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.356
Just gonna be in the electric chair.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.471
Hey, Deb, change of plans.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.269
Dex.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.511
Saxon's in here.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.637
Arrest him. Take him in.

47:31.800 --> 47:34.235
Arrest him? He's still alive?

47:35.720 --> 47:39.316
Say you were looking into the buildings
he was inspecting. You subdued him.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.040
You'll be the hero of Miami Metro.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.759
I guess I fucking will.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.759
What about your knives?

47:49.920 --> 47:52.276
I've got a plane to catch.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.312
Do you want me
to send them to you?

47:56.480 --> 47:59.996
Leave them as evidence.
Say you found them in the cabinet.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.880
- People will think they're Saxon's.
- Let them.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.680
Give him even more credit
than he deserves.

48:05.840 --> 48:08.912
Once I get settled, I'm gonna figure
out a way to get in touch.

48:09.080 --> 48:10.753
- Dexter--
- My car, I'll leave it at the airport.

48:10.920 --> 48:13.310
- Dexter.
- And--

48:14.400 --> 48:16.119
What?

48:17.640 --> 48:19.996
You could at least fucking hug me.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.989
This is just for right now.
It's not forever.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.396
I know that, fuckface.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.754
Go get on a plane.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.873
I will.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.475
Are you sure about this, Dexter?

48:54.800 --> 48:56.712
I am.

48:57.720 --> 49:00.189
I never thought this day would come.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.551
You don't need me anymore.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.598
This is Debra Morgan
requesting backup...

49:31.760 --> 49:34.912
...at the Rendell Psychiatric Hospital
in Allapattah.

49:47.160 --> 49:49.516
What the fuck is going on here?

49:51.560 --> 49:53.153
Help me, please!

49:53.320 --> 49:55.357
I was abducted by the man
who was just here.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.352
- Did you see him?
- I didn't see anybody.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.115
Get me out of here, please,
before he comes back.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.757
I thought I was gonna die.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.952
Thank God you came here.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.074
Don't move.

50:33.680 --> 50:37.469
This is Detective Debra Morgan.
I've been shot.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.720
Please send help.

50:48.200 --> 50:51.034
<i>I used to live my life at night.</i>

50:52.480 --> 50:55.598
<i>In the shadow of my dark passenger.</i>

50:56.360 --> 50:59.353
<i>I lived in shadows for so long...</i>

50:59.520 --> 51:02.513
<i>...until the dark became my world.</i>

51:03.960 --> 51:06.680
<i>But over time, the people in my life...</i>

51:06.840 --> 51:08.513
<i>...flipped on a light.</i>

51:11.240 --> 51:14.836
<i>At first I was blinded,
it was so bright.</i>

51:19.520 --> 51:21.910
<i>But over the years,
my eyes adjusted...</i>

51:22.080 --> 51:24.151
<i>...and I could see.</i>

51:25.600 --> 51:28.399
<i>And now what's in focus
is my future.</i>

51:28.600 --> 51:30.273
<i>Bright.</i>

51:30.480 --> 51:33.279
<i>Brighter than it's ever been.</i>
