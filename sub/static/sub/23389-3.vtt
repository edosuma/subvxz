00:02.427 --> 00:03.469
Previously, on "The Path":

00:03.471 --> 00:04.514
 I have decided to

00:04.515 --> 00:06.184
leave the gates open

00:06.185 --> 00:09.106
so that anyone can enter
as they please.

00:09.107 --> 00:10.652
Since when does an IS

00:10.653 --> 00:12.029
know more than we do?

00:12.030 --> 00:13.824
This doesn't feel like change.

00:13.825 --> 00:16.036
It feels like it's
the beginning of the end.

00:16.038 --> 00:18.041
 You're Hawk Lane?

00:18.042 --> 00:21.005
I was just expecting some

00:21.006 --> 00:22.634
bearded old hippie dude.

00:22.635 --> 00:23.761
You saved me.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.389
You did that.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.517
Say it.

00:26.518 --> 00:28.228
 I did that.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.606
 Here, in case you want to
talk some more.

00:29.607 --> 00:30.858
 Yeah, I don't.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.988
 No, about... your religion.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.616
 It's easy to be punished.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.369
It's harder to forgive yourself.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.914
 Meyerism...

00:37.915 --> 00:41.045
doesn't work for me anymore.

00:41.046 --> 00:45.095
I think something bad
happened to me

00:45.096 --> 00:46.724
when I was a child.

00:46.725 --> 00:50.857
The son is here.

00:50.858 --> 00:53.194
It begins.

00:53.195 --> 00:54.865
 Is anybody out here?

01:48.222 --> 01:51.895
 I'm Sarah Lane.

01:51.896 --> 01:56.237
So tell me
what brought you in here today.

01:56.238 --> 01:58.450
 I'm scared.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.038
Feels like we're

02:01.039 --> 02:03.752
headed towards World War III.

02:03.753 --> 02:06.550
 What brought you here today?

02:06.551 --> 02:08.762
 I have to lose
a hundred pounds.

02:08.763 --> 02:11.977
 What brought you here today?

02:11.978 --> 02:14.273
 I have a drinking problem.

02:14.274 --> 02:16.653
 I broke up with my girlfriend.

02:16.654 --> 02:18.239
 If it wasn't for my kids,
I wouldn't even

02:18.240 --> 02:20.953
get out of bed
in the morning anymore.

02:20.954 --> 02:22.791
 Nuclear war,
the environment...

02:22.792 --> 02:24.836
World's falling apart.

02:24.837 --> 02:26.172
What have you tried?

02:26.173 --> 02:28.259
 Weight Watchers, paleo,

02:28.260 --> 02:30.681
no carbs, gastric bypass...

02:30.682 --> 02:32.602
 I had to explain to my
kindergartener

02:32.603 --> 02:34.230
what a school shooter is.

02:34.231 --> 02:35.525
 We can help you.

02:35.526 --> 02:37.779
 Everyone looks so happy here.

02:37.780 --> 02:40.492
 Hypnotism, aversion therapy...

02:40.493 --> 02:42.454
 We can help you.

02:42.455 --> 02:44.626
 I can't watch the news
anymore.

02:44.627 --> 02:46.295
 I feel like I'm wasting
my life.

02:46.296 --> 02:49.719
 We can help you.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.347
 What are you looking for?

02:51.348 --> 02:53.894
 Love.

 Community.

02:56.358 --> 02:58.654
 Guidance.

02:58.655 --> 03:01.075
 Safety.

03:01.076 --> 03:03.496
 Peace.

03:03.497 --> 03:05.000
How did you get here?

03:05.001 --> 03:07.922
Where are you from?

03:07.923 --> 03:09.969
What's your name?

03:16.315 --> 03:20.405
Look, kid...

03:20.406 --> 03:21.867
I really want to help you out,

03:21.868 --> 03:24.205
but you got to give me
something.

03:27.503 --> 03:29.089
 Logan.

03:29.090 --> 03:31.011
 Logan.

03:32.848 --> 03:35.268
All right.

03:35.269 --> 03:38.149
Where are you
supposed to be right now?

03:38.150 --> 03:39.987
School?

03:43.327 --> 03:45.246
Where are your parents?

03:45.247 --> 03:47.335
 Dead.

03:49.464 --> 03:51.217
 Okay, where do you stay
when you're not hiding out

03:51.218 --> 03:52.553
in our woods?

03:52.554 --> 03:54.766
 My brother's place.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.561
 Who beat you up?

03:56.562 --> 03:59.776
 Couple of his friends.

03:59.777 --> 04:03.408
 What's the deal with that?

04:03.409 --> 04:06.581
 My brother gave it to me.

04:06.582 --> 04:09.211
Helped me get by in juvie.

04:09.212 --> 04:11.717
 So you've been to juvie?

04:11.718 --> 04:13.052
 Twice.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.223
 Do you believe in it?

04:15.224 --> 04:17.310
 The tattoo?  Yeah.

04:17.310 --> 04:20.860
 Doesn't mean anything.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.448


04:23.449 --> 04:25.118
Listen, Logan,

04:25.119 --> 04:26.872
this is a community

04:26.873 --> 04:29.293
full of love and acceptance.

04:29.294 --> 04:33.176
We do not tolerate hate.

04:33.177 --> 04:35.305
 I don't hate anybody.

04:35.306 --> 04:37.894
 What?

04:37.895 --> 04:39.565
 I don't hate anybody.

04:42.571 --> 04:44.365
 Why did you kill
those rabbits?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.622
 Because I hadn't eaten
anything

04:47.623 --> 04:48.707
in four days,

04:48.708 --> 04:51.171
and I was fucking hungry.

05:15.971 --> 05:19.268
 It's so pretty here.

05:19.269 --> 05:20.521
 Yep.

05:20.522 --> 05:22.274
I have to get out of here.

05:22.275 --> 05:24.654
 What do you mean?

05:24.655 --> 05:28.494
 I just can't be here.
Just, um...

05:28.495 --> 05:30.165
we have to go.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.793
 Where?  I don't know.

05:31.794 --> 05:33.421
 We don't have much money
saved.

05:33.422 --> 05:35.634
We need a place to stay,
money for diapers...

05:35.635 --> 05:36.928
 Mary, you don't understand.
I'm suffocating.

05:36.929 --> 05:40.101
I can't be this person anymore.

05:40.102 --> 05:42.565
Ithisthis servant.

05:42.566 --> 05:44.862
 Okay. Yeah, of course.

05:48.076 --> 05:50.539
Wait, you mean
you mean leave right now?

05:50.540 --> 05:51.833
 Yeah, I'm gonna talk
to Harold,

05:51.834 --> 05:52.919
we'll get our things together

05:52.920 --> 05:54.004
 Is he gonna let us?

05:54.005 --> 05:55.674
 We're not prisoners.

05:55.675 --> 05:57.260
 Why don't we
sneak out when he's asleep?

05:57.261 --> 05:58.931
 God, no, no,
this is exactly why

05:58.932 --> 06:00.350
we have to go,
because I can't be somewhere

06:00.351 --> 06:01.603
wherewhere we're trapped.

06:01.604 --> 06:02.688
 And what about the contract?

06:02.689 --> 06:05.360
 I'll talk to him.

06:05.361 --> 06:07.239
All right?

06:07.240 --> 06:10.287
He can't force us to stay.

06:20.432 --> 06:22.060
American religion

06:22.061 --> 06:25.943
is a private, personal
experience.

06:25.944 --> 06:27.780
Bloom argues

06:27.781 --> 06:30.118
that almost all
American religious groups.

06:30.119 --> 06:32.455
SeventhDay Adventism,

06:32.456 --> 06:34.334
Mormonism, Southern Baptists,

06:34.335 --> 06:36.005
Pentecostalism

06:36.006 --> 06:38.426
believe that salvation
cannot be achieved

06:38.427 --> 06:40.597
by engaging with a community,

06:40.598 --> 06:44.939
but rather by an intense
inward solitude,

06:44.940 --> 06:48.362
that you must experience
some kind of

06:48.363 --> 06:51.368
direct confrontation with God

06:51.369 --> 06:53.456
in order to be saved.

06:53.457 --> 06:55.878
Now, since we have our

06:55.879 --> 06:58.132
friendly resident
fringe movement

06:58.133 --> 07:01.765
representative here with us,
Sarah...

07:01.766 --> 07:03.977
Tell us.

07:03.978 --> 07:05.689
Is that how you understand
Meyerism?

07:05.690 --> 07:08.069
 No.

07:08.070 --> 07:12.410
I mean, confrontation
is such a negative... word.

07:12.411 --> 07:14.874
Experiencing The Light is a...

07:14.875 --> 07:17.630
positive, profound experience.

07:17.631 --> 07:20.301
 Has it always been that way?

07:20.302 --> 07:22.890
I mean, Steve Meyer,
didn't he...

07:22.891 --> 07:25.144
find darkness and destruction
at the top of that Ladder?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.648
 I mean, he only saw that
so he could lead

07:26.649 --> 07:28.860
the rest of us to The Light.

07:28.861 --> 07:31.406
To the Truth.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.203
Sorry, I have to go.

07:41.804 --> 07:44.224
 Tell you what, guys:
Class dismissed.

07:44.225 --> 07:45.937
 Shit.

07:49.110 --> 07:52.031
 At least you weren't towed.

07:52.032 --> 07:54.286
I'm sorry.

07:54.287 --> 07:55.454
Was I pissing you off
back there?

07:55.455 --> 07:56.791
 No, not at all.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.460
I'm just, um,

07:58.461 --> 08:00.131
late for a meeting.
 Right. And if,

08:00.132 --> 08:01.926
you're late, then they make you

08:01.927 --> 08:05.016
scrub the bathroom floors
with a toothbrush.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.730
What if they found out
you were here?

08:07.731 --> 08:09.232
 They'd be fine.

08:09.233 --> 08:10.777
Yeah.

08:10.778 --> 08:12.113
You have this narrative
in your head

08:12.114 --> 08:13.199
about Meyerism, and it's...

08:13.200 --> 08:14.785
It's not like that.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.455
We have free will.

08:16.456 --> 08:18.459
 Good, because I wanted
to ask you a question.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.966
Would you like
to have dinner with me?

08:21.967 --> 08:22.928
 No.

08:22.929 --> 08:24.972
That's not... No.

08:24.973 --> 08:27.811
 Because you're not...
allowed, or

08:27.812 --> 08:30.943
because you don't want to?

08:30.944 --> 08:34.659
 Whatever makes you
feel better about yourself.

08:34.659 --> 08:36.580


08:39.878 --> 08:42.716
This kid was me, 20 years ago.

08:42.717 --> 08:44.804
 You didn't have a swastika
tattooed to your arm.

08:44.805 --> 08:48.394
 No, but I had other shit.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.522
We all did.

08:49.523 --> 08:52.193
That is how we got here.

08:52.194 --> 08:53.613
Okay? He is just a kid.

08:53.614 --> 08:54.615
We can help him.

08:54.616 --> 08:55.909
 He's not a kid.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.580
He had a knife. We're open,

08:57.581 --> 08:59.291
but we can't be fools about it.

08:59.292 --> 09:01.128
 Look, in our community,

09:01.129 --> 09:03.758
we accept people
for who they are.

09:03.759 --> 09:05.846
Without judgement.

09:05.847 --> 09:07.766
That's always been the way.

09:07.767 --> 09:09.227
 These are different times.

09:09.228 --> 09:12.191
We can't afford to be naive.

09:12.192 --> 09:14.279
Religious communities
are targets.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.618
We're getting more
more Possibles than ever.

09:16.619 --> 09:18.955
 I'm doing
a dozen intake sessions a day.

09:18.956 --> 09:20.584
People don't feel safe
in their communities,

09:20.585 --> 09:22.295
and they are coming to us.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.923
 Does this boy want to
live in The Light,

09:23.924 --> 09:26.136
or does he want
free room and board?

09:26.137 --> 09:28.015
 Look, it is our job

09:28.016 --> 09:29.685
to show him The Light

09:29.686 --> 09:32.315
and hope that he makes
that choice for himself.

09:32.316 --> 09:34.987
Vera can help communicate
what we're doing

09:34.988 --> 09:37.785
to the community.  Vera...

09:37.786 --> 09:39.371
isn't one of us.

09:39.372 --> 09:42.168
She has no part
in this conversation.

09:42.169 --> 09:44.382
We need to assess
the boy's Damage.

09:46.302 --> 09:48.222
 Assess the boy's Damage.

09:48.223 --> 09:51.144
What, by doing the ODE?

09:51.145 --> 09:52.355
We don't do that anymore.

09:52.356 --> 09:54.067
 Because we haven't had to.

09:54.068 --> 09:56.154
We haven't had
anyone like him come through.

09:56.155 --> 09:58.325
 The ODE is the only way
to determine whether or not

09:58.326 --> 10:01.624
he can truly receive The Light.

10:01.625 --> 10:02.835
Sarah, will you administer?

10:02.836 --> 10:05.632
 I'll set it up.

10:05.633 --> 10:08.848
 If he fails, he has to go.

10:11.269 --> 10:13.481
Are we in agreement?

10:16.070 --> 10:17.280
 Yeah.

10:17.281 --> 10:18.909
Let's do the test.

10:56.777 --> 10:58.947
 Wow. This is an embarrassment.

10:58.948 --> 11:01.953
 Okay, Mom, please, breathe.

11:01.954 --> 11:04.332
 So, what do you think?

11:04.333 --> 11:06.169
 What the hell have you
been doing the last two weeks?

11:06.170 --> 11:08.507
 We made a lot of progress.

11:08.508 --> 11:10.344
Sorry, I'm Tom.

11:10.345 --> 11:12.056
 Vera.  Wow, I've heard

11:12.057 --> 11:13.852
so much about you
 No, no, okay,

11:13.853 --> 11:15.522
don't shake his hand.
You should kiss her feet.

11:15.523 --> 11:17.568
Do you understand
what he's been doing for us?

11:17.569 --> 11:19.153
We need Meyerism to spread

11:19.154 --> 11:20.574
to all four corners
of the Earth,

11:20.575 --> 11:22.159
and it's well on its way

11:22.160 --> 11:23.788
because of her.

11:23.789 --> 11:25.457
New members every day,

11:25.458 --> 11:27.044
college kids drinking
that dumb-ass juice,

11:27.045 --> 11:28.590
and their leader

11:28.591 --> 11:31.136
can't take a piss
without asking her first,

11:31.137 --> 11:33.140
but meanwhile,
you can't even install a fan.

11:33.141 --> 11:34.727
 Lilith, this type of work
takes time. I had to design

11:34.728 --> 11:36.062
 It's not a fucking tea party.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.566
It has to be finished.

11:37.567 --> 11:38.651
You can't be setting the table

11:38.652 --> 11:39.653
when the end comes.

11:39.654 --> 11:41.574
Work faster.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.243
Do you realize
how little time we have?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.663
Dear, can you tell him
what happens

11:44.664 --> 11:46.291
if they don't finish in time?

11:46.292 --> 11:49.674
 Yeah. You'll die
like the rest of them.

12:21.530 --> 12:25.036
 Nobody has anything
to unburden?

12:35.223 --> 12:36.726
Then let me offer strength

12:36.727 --> 12:38.145
and community to us all

12:38.146 --> 12:41.151
as we continue our journey to

12:41.152 --> 12:43.363
enlightenment in climbing...

12:43.364 --> 12:45.243
The Ladder of Truth.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.551
 Joy...

12:53.552 --> 12:55.220
 Yeah?

12:55.221 --> 12:57.141
 What was that?

12:57.142 --> 12:58.770
 I didn't say anything.

12:58.771 --> 13:00.355
 Yeah, I know. Nobody did.

13:00.356 --> 13:01.692
That's what I'm talking about.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.278
 Honestly, a lot of people

13:03.279 --> 13:05.365
are really freaked out
by that Nazi kid.

13:05.366 --> 13:07.161
 He's not a Nazi.
 It goes against

13:07.162 --> 13:08.664
everything we believe,

13:08.665 --> 13:10.084
not to mention
it puts us at risk

13:10.085 --> 13:11.754
every time
we step on the compound.

13:11.755 --> 13:13.591
 Okay, well, why didn't
anybody say anything?

13:13.592 --> 13:15.260
That's the entire point
of unburdening.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.056
 Because it's
your dad's decision,

13:17.057 --> 13:19.895
and you're like your dad's
good little foot soldier.

13:19.896 --> 13:21.982
 Okay, that is not true at all.

13:21.983 --> 13:23.778
 Okay, so if people had said
something, you what?

13:23.779 --> 13:24.822
Go and ask your dad, and he...
 No, I

13:24.823 --> 13:25.949
 Kicks the kid out?

13:25.950 --> 13:27.368
 I would sit with him

13:27.369 --> 13:28.871
and I would ask  Okay, Hawk.

13:28.872 --> 13:30.667
You're white.

13:30.668 --> 13:32.086
Maybe you can afford
to assume that you're safe,

13:32.087 --> 13:35.300
but some of us can't.

13:35.301 --> 13:36.386
Anyway, whatever. I need

13:36.387 --> 13:37.597
your help with something.

13:37.598 --> 13:38.683
 Okay.  I need you

13:38.684 --> 13:40.060
to go bowling with me.

13:40.061 --> 13:41.897
 Okay, what?

13:41.898 --> 13:43.483
 Caleb and some of the
Musa kids are going

13:43.484 --> 13:45.112
and he asked us if we could go.

13:45.113 --> 13:47.909
 Well, whywhy c
Why do I have to go?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.580
Why can't you just go
with Caleb?

13:49.581 --> 13:50.707
 Because, I'm pretty sure
they can't date

13:50.708 --> 13:52.418
outside their religion,

13:52.419 --> 13:54.548
so it's probably, like,
a group date thing.

13:54.549 --> 13:55.925
 I have a girlfriend

13:55.926 --> 13:58.931
 Yeah, who's doing 2R in Haiti.

13:58.932 --> 14:00.852
Hawk, come on.

14:00.853 --> 14:02.522
You've had a little bit
of a stick up your ass

14:02.523 --> 14:04.317
since your dad became leader.

14:04.318 --> 14:07.782
You don't have to be
the son of God all the time.

14:07.783 --> 14:10.539
Bowling might be good for you.

14:48.907 --> 14:51.663
Are you ready to begin?

14:57.382 --> 15:00.388


15:02.893 --> 15:04.186
Where am I?

15:04.187 --> 15:05.940
 You're in an evaluation room.

15:05.941 --> 15:08.153
We're getting ready to start.

15:08.154 --> 15:10.490
Observable Damage Evaluation.

15:10.491 --> 15:12.411
 How did you get me here?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.331
 We moved you.

15:14.332 --> 15:15.835
 You drugged me.

15:15.836 --> 15:18.214
 No, we gave you a safe
herbal sleep aid

15:18.215 --> 15:20.261
so we can start with your mind
perfectly clear.

15:21.556 --> 15:22.766
 What's on my arm?

15:22.767 --> 15:24.268
 ODE works best when you're

15:24.269 --> 15:25.270
at complete resting state
heart rate,

15:25.271 --> 15:26.983
below 60.

15:30.448 --> 15:32.577
Are you present?

15:32.578 --> 15:33.913
 I guess.

15:33.914 --> 15:35.666
 What's your full name?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.671
 Logan Dodd.

15:40.594 --> 15:43.682
 Are you a spiritual person?

15:43.683 --> 15:45.645
 No.

15:45.646 --> 15:47.816
 Do you believe in God?

15:47.817 --> 15:49.528
 Definitely not.

15:49.529 --> 15:52.032
 Do you believe in
the afterlife?

15:52.033 --> 15:54.411
 No.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.919
 Do you have control
over your dreams?

15:57.920 --> 16:00.132
 I don't know.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.094
 Do you like being alone?
 Yes.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.722
Do you feel sorry for others

16:03.723 --> 16:05.142
who have less than you?

16:05.143 --> 16:06.645
 Yes.

16:06.646 --> 16:08.356
 Do you feel sorry
for yourself?

16:08.357 --> 16:09.568
 No.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.195
 In general, do you believe

16:11.196 --> 16:12.866
bad things that happen
are your fault?

16:12.867 --> 16:14.410
 No.

16:14.411 --> 16:16.205
 Have other done bad things
to you?

16:16.206 --> 16:17.834
 Yes.

16:17.835 --> 16:19.796
 What would you change
about yourself?

16:19.797 --> 16:22.217
 I wish I could change
what other people see about me.

16:22.218 --> 16:24.388
 Are your harder on yourself
or on others?

16:24.389 --> 16:25.766
 I don't know.  Go deeper.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.021
 Other people are harder on me.

16:28.022 --> 16:29.566
 What do you mean?

16:29.567 --> 16:32.154
 I don't know. Nothing.

16:32.155 --> 16:33.824
Nobody gives me a chance.

16:33.825 --> 16:35.786
Everybody just assumes
I'm a piece of shit.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.582
 Why is that?

16:37.583 --> 16:39.961
 Probably 'cause my parents
are both pieces of shit,

16:39.962 --> 16:41.632
and my brother's
a piece of shit.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.677
Usually runs in the family,
I guess.

16:43.678 --> 16:46.516
 You told Eddie
that your parents were dead.

16:46.517 --> 16:49.021


16:49.022 --> 16:51.777
My dad is.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.782
 And your mom?

16:55.827 --> 16:57.121
 Didn't want me.

17:00.712 --> 17:02.674
 Who are you closest to?

17:02.675 --> 17:06.807
In the world, right now?

17:06.808 --> 17:10.690
Who are you closest to?

17:10.691 --> 17:12.694
 Nobody.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.083
 Do you remember the last time
you felt joy?

17:20.084 --> 17:22.462


17:22.463 --> 17:25.050
I don't know.

17:25.051 --> 17:28.183
 Go deeper.

17:43.213 --> 17:46.218
 When I was 12, my brother
got me a pet chicken.

17:46.219 --> 17:49.475
 What did you name it?

17:49.476 --> 17:50.978
 Captain.

17:50.979 --> 17:53.024
 Captain.

17:53.025 --> 17:55.071
 He was really smart.

17:57.283 --> 18:00.205
He was my best friend
for, like, two years.

18:00.206 --> 18:01.918
 What happened?

18:06.301 --> 18:10.058
 Cockfight.

18:10.059 --> 18:13.272
My brother made me do it.

18:13.273 --> 18:17.573
Captain was really sweet.
He didn't stand a chance.

18:17.574 --> 18:21.080
Got the shit kicked out of him
by a bigger bird.

18:21.081 --> 18:23.670
Razors on his spurs.

18:26.968 --> 18:28.930
Bled out in a couple minutes.

18:35.109 --> 18:37.280
 Thank you.

18:43.793 --> 18:45.630
He scored a 28.

18:49.345 --> 18:50.639
All right.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.309
Well, give him another shot.

18:52.310 --> 18:54.188
Okay, maybe he was nervous.

18:54.189 --> 18:56.150
 No, that's not how it works.
Steve was a psychiatrist.

18:56.151 --> 18:58.196
He worked with a lot of people
that had Damage.

18:58.197 --> 18:59.991
He knew how to find darkness.

18:59.992 --> 19:01.745
 All right, well, let me
work with him

19:01.746 --> 19:04.959
for a couple of weeks.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.130
Okay? I mean, he's so young.

19:07.131 --> 19:09.761
And he didn't have a choice.
I mean...

19:09.762 --> 19:13.017
Dead dad, his mom...

19:13.018 --> 19:14.521
Look, maybe I can get to him.

19:14.522 --> 19:15.940
 Doesn't matter.

19:15.941 --> 19:17.860
 It does matter.

19:17.861 --> 19:19.488
I refuse to believe that

19:19.489 --> 19:22.118
some people are beyond help.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.332
 You promised the Council.

19:27.380 --> 19:28.757
 What if you guys

19:28.758 --> 19:31.805
turned your backs on me?

19:31.806 --> 19:35.270
 You scored a 97 on the ODE.

19:35.271 --> 19:36.773
 How do you know that?
 Because people

19:36.774 --> 19:38.317
talked about it. You were...

19:38.318 --> 19:40.823
Damaged, but you were
full of Light.

19:40.824 --> 19:45.123
This kid is beyond the capacity
to help.

19:45.124 --> 19:47.962
 Where is he supposed to go?

19:47.963 --> 19:49.172
 His brother is his
legal guardian.

19:49.173 --> 19:50.718
 He's not going back there.

19:50.719 --> 19:52.178
 Well, then, I'll make
some calls.

19:52.179 --> 19:54.349
I'll connect
with child services.

19:54.350 --> 19:56.437
 I am not sending him
to child services.

19:56.438 --> 19:57.940
 They can help him.

19:57.941 --> 19:59.234
We can't.

19:59.235 --> 20:00.906
And if you can't do it, I will.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.706
 No.

20:05.707 --> 20:07.460
I brought him in. I'll do it.

20:24.327 --> 20:25.704
 Been two days.

20:25.705 --> 20:28.085
I still feel like shit.

20:31.676 --> 20:34.388
Thanks, boss.

20:34.389 --> 20:37.561
 Pickled ume. It'll,
replace your electrolytes.

20:37.562 --> 20:40.025
Here. Under your tongue.

20:42.279 --> 20:44.785
Um...

20:49.252 --> 20:50.963
Harold, I need to apologize.

20:50.964 --> 20:52.758
Um...

20:52.759 --> 20:55.388
The other night, I
I let you down.

20:55.389 --> 20:57.518
 We both fucked up.
 Yeah, but I'm

20:57.519 --> 20:59.271
supposed to be stronger,

20:59.272 --> 21:02.068
and I let my own Damage

21:02.069 --> 21:04.782
get in the way of our progress
together.

21:04.783 --> 21:07.580
 It's okay.  No, it's not,

21:07.581 --> 21:10.084
which is why I need

21:10.085 --> 21:13.633
to go away and do some work
on myself.

21:13.634 --> 21:15.554
Yeah, because I'm not in
the condition,

21:15.555 --> 21:18.142
right now, to help someone else.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.647
 What?  II can't afford

21:20.648 --> 21:22.358
to inflict any more harm

21:22.359 --> 21:24.781
onto you.

21:24.782 --> 21:26.534
Mary and I need to leave.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.329
 You can't.
 No, well, I understand

21:28.330 --> 21:30.249
we had an agreement.
 We signed a contract.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.588
 We can't stay here anymore.

21:32.589 --> 21:35.093
 That's not how it works.
You don't break contracts.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.721
That's the point of
a fucking contract.

21:36.722 --> 21:38.683
Look it up. Look it up
on your phone.

21:38.684 --> 21:40.144
 No, I'm not going to do that.

21:40.145 --> 21:41.731
 Saul!

21:41.732 --> 21:43.234
 "A written or spoken
agreement,

21:43.235 --> 21:44.695
enforceable by law."

21:44.696 --> 21:46.700
 "By law." You're breaking
the law!

21:49.247 --> 21:50.624
You can't do this.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.168
Sorry, you can't leave.

21:52.169 --> 21:53.880
 Harold, Harold,
I firmly believe

21:53.881 --> 21:55.884
that you have the tools
to climb The Ladder.

21:55.885 --> 21:58.055
 I don't. I need you!

21:58.056 --> 22:00.227
 No, you are all you need.

22:02.858 --> 22:05.904
 Okay.

22:05.905 --> 22:07.534
Okay, I get...

22:10.874 --> 22:12.835
At least let me make you a

22:12.836 --> 22:15.423
goodbye dinner or something.

22:15.424 --> 22:18.638
I want to give you guys
a proper sendoff.

22:18.639 --> 22:19.932
...  Let me at least do that.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.728
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:21.729 --> 22:23.189
 Small Saul!

22:23.190 --> 22:25.987
We've got to clean
this place up!

22:39.640 --> 22:41.601
 Hey.

22:41.602 --> 22:43.437
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

22:43.438 --> 22:44.649
 Sorry.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.193
I was just trying to fix it.

22:46.194 --> 22:48.155
 Fix it?

22:48.156 --> 22:51.495
 Your irrigation's broke. See?

22:51.496 --> 22:53.082
Those plants are
getting drowned. I just

22:53.083 --> 22:54.878
I wanted to get them
out of the ground.

22:57.926 --> 22:59.596
I really like plants and stuff.

23:01.474 --> 23:04.730
I lived on a farm for a while.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.276
One of the group homes.

23:11.745 --> 23:13.289
I was just trying to help.

23:13.290 --> 23:14.834
You said everybody here
contributes.

23:14.835 --> 23:17.589
 I appreciate that.

23:17.590 --> 23:20.220
I'm sorry. I thought you were...

23:24.061 --> 23:26.190
Thank you.

23:28.361 --> 23:30.489
All right.

23:30.490 --> 23:32.369
Let's get these
out of the ground.

23:54.372 --> 23:56.751
 Hello, Meadow. Gavin.

23:56.752 --> 23:58.296
Katrina.

23:59.256 --> 24:01.929
 Can't believe he's
still here, right?

24:04.893 --> 24:06.228
 You all right?

24:06.229 --> 24:08.399
 I'm used to it.

24:08.400 --> 24:12.156
 It's not gonna
be like that here.

24:12.157 --> 24:13.828
Okay?

24:22.679 --> 24:26.143
Hello, everybody. Um...

24:26.144 --> 24:27.938
I want you to meet Logan.

24:27.939 --> 24:30.234
He's going to be staying with us

24:30.235 --> 24:32.488
for a little while, so please,

24:32.489 --> 24:34.535
make him feel welcome.

24:34.536 --> 24:36.873
Okay?

24:36.874 --> 24:39.502
Thank you.

24:39.503 --> 24:41.006
All right, so the food
is right here.

24:41.007 --> 24:42.926
Drinks right behind it.

24:42.927 --> 24:44.345
Take whatever you want,
all right?

24:44.346 --> 24:46.684
 Can I talk to you for a sec?

24:46.685 --> 24:48.020
 Not if it's about the kid.

24:48.021 --> 24:50.274
 Sarah said he failed.

24:50.275 --> 24:51.652
Bad.

24:51.653 --> 24:53.322
 Look, the ODE

24:53.323 --> 24:55.367
doesn't always tell
the full story.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.121
 Since when?

24:57.122 --> 24:59.793
Look, I know you've got this new

24:59.794 --> 25:02.048
open doors policy...  

25:02.049 --> 25:03.551
 But my husband's away

25:03.552 --> 25:05.304
and I need to keep
my family safe.

25:05.305 --> 25:07.266
Did you hear there was
a bomb threat at a mosque

25:07.267 --> 25:08.978
in Spring Valley yesterday?
 The kid is not

25:08.979 --> 25:10.565
building a bomb.

25:10.566 --> 25:12.778
 How do you know?

25:12.779 --> 25:14.239
 Look, he is a good kid

25:14.240 --> 25:17.411
who's had a shitty life.

25:17.412 --> 25:21.336
Not all kids grow up
like your kids.

25:21.337 --> 25:22.631
Okay?

25:22.632 --> 25:25.302
Some people need
a second chance.

25:25.303 --> 25:26.722
 Don't pull that shit on me.

25:26.723 --> 25:28.267
I have seen hundreds of people

25:28.268 --> 25:29.435
come here
and change their lives,

25:29.436 --> 25:30.897
but they didn't have

25:30.898 --> 25:32.275
a deep, ingrained hatred
in their hearts.

25:32.276 --> 25:33.987
 Neither does Logan.

25:33.988 --> 25:35.197
Okay?

25:35.198 --> 25:37.326
 You're sure of that?

25:37.327 --> 25:39.122
 Look, it doesn't matter.

25:39.123 --> 25:40.374
He's staying.

25:40.375 --> 25:42.503
Logan.

25:42.504 --> 25:44.215


25:44.216 --> 25:46.261
 Hey, I, want you to meet

25:46.262 --> 25:47.471
Nicole.

25:47.472 --> 25:49.142
Nicole, this is Logan.

25:49.143 --> 25:51.272
Do you have
two extra seats at your table?

25:53.484 --> 25:55.280
Thank you.

26:08.014 --> 26:09.558
 Yes!

26:09.559 --> 26:11.979
 That was awesome.  Thank you.

26:11.980 --> 26:14.233
 So, are you guys
allowed to date

26:14.234 --> 26:16.112
outside the religion,
or are you, like,

26:16.113 --> 26:17.824
breaking the rules?

26:17.825 --> 26:20.204
I mean, it's not rules
that we have,

26:20.205 --> 26:22.333
but, yes, technically,
we're supposed to

26:22.334 --> 26:23.961
date other Christians.

26:23.962 --> 26:25.674
 'Cause we'll corrupt you
or something?

26:25.675 --> 26:27.343
 No, no.

26:27.344 --> 26:29.389
According to the Bible,
we're just...

26:29.390 --> 26:31.602
unequally yoked.

26:31.603 --> 26:34.023
 What the hell does that mean?

26:34.024 --> 26:35.568
 It's Corinthians:

26:35.569 --> 26:37.446
"Do not be bound together
with unbelievers.

26:37.447 --> 26:40.494
"What partnership has
righteousness and lawlessness?

26:40.495 --> 26:42.666
What fellowship has light
with darkness?"

26:42.667 --> 26:44.127
 So we're just

26:44.128 --> 26:46.048
lawless, dark, unbelievers?

26:48.428 --> 26:50.305
 I'm not my dad.

26:50.306 --> 26:52.686
 What do you believe?

26:52.687 --> 26:54.021
 I'm...

26:54.022 --> 26:56.109
attracted to people

26:56.110 --> 26:58.113
who have a deep faith.

26:58.114 --> 27:00.910
Who believe in something.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.123
 Totally.

27:03.124 --> 27:04.292
Me too.

27:04.293 --> 27:05.545


27:05.546 --> 27:07.131
 What?

27:07.132 --> 27:08.885
 You have a girlfriend, Hawk?

27:08.886 --> 27:10.220
 Yeah, um,

27:10.221 --> 27:11.849
she's doing service in Haiti.

27:11.850 --> 27:13.895
 And it's not that serious.

27:13.896 --> 27:15.314
 What are you talking about?

27:15.315 --> 27:16.817
 I mean, she's not, like,
the one.

27:16.818 --> 27:19.698
 You actually have no idea.

27:19.699 --> 27:21.535
 Hawk used to be
really in love with this girl

27:21.536 --> 27:23.371
who was an IS, like you.

27:23.372 --> 27:25.001
Not one of us.

27:26.504 --> 27:28.089
 You're drunk.

27:28.090 --> 27:30.803
 He's a little bit
of a romantic.

27:30.804 --> 27:32.724
Still kinda heartbroken.

27:32.725 --> 27:34.143
 Fuck off, Joy.

27:34.144 --> 27:36.941
 Sorry.

27:36.942 --> 27:38.861
Hawk's dad became Jesus,

27:38.862 --> 27:40.908
and he became sort of
a buzzkill.

27:46.210 --> 27:48.631
 Sorry.  No, I...

27:48.632 --> 27:51.052
I get it. You do not
have to explain yourself, dude.

27:51.053 --> 27:53.057
  I get it all.

27:55.270 --> 27:57.274
More than you know.

28:04.371 --> 28:06.165
 Toast.

28:06.166 --> 28:10.007
We have to toast.

28:10.008 --> 28:12.220
A lovely sparkling cider.

28:15.351 --> 28:16.436
Come on, Cal.

28:16.437 --> 28:18.189
We're toasting.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.028
Cal?

28:29.463 --> 28:31.466
To you guys.

28:31.467 --> 28:33.888
For everything you've done.

28:33.889 --> 28:36.059
You've changed my life.

28:36.060 --> 28:39.274
You know that, right?
 No, you changed your life.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.574
I'm gonna miss you guys.

28:43.575 --> 28:45.077
Don't know how I'm gonna
do it without you.

28:45.078 --> 28:46.538
 You'll be okay.  Will I?

28:46.539 --> 28:48.291
 YeahYeah.  Nah.

28:48.292 --> 28:50.337
Don't worry about it.

28:50.338 --> 28:52.049
Not your problem anymore.

28:52.050 --> 28:53.301
Out of sight,

28:53.302 --> 28:55.890
out of mind, right?

28:55.891 --> 28:57.476
That's what everyone
does to me, anyways.

28:57.477 --> 28:59.606
Takes what they want
and then leaves.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.275
 No, no, no.

29:01.276 --> 29:03.656
That's not what we're doing.

29:03.657 --> 29:05.117
 Cal just needs
to work on himself.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.997
 It's cool.

29:07.998 --> 29:09.668
I get it.

29:09.669 --> 29:11.672
You know how many
buddies from home

29:11.673 --> 29:13.258
I've had mooch off me?

29:13.259 --> 29:14.886
Act like we're best friends

29:14.887 --> 29:16.765
and then get the fuck out
when shit gets dark?

29:16.766 --> 29:19.395
It's cool.
How you want your steak cooked?

29:19.396 --> 29:20.648
-  We don't eat meat.
- And you don't either.

29:20.649 --> 29:22.401
You've been doing really good.

29:22.402 --> 29:24.488
 We all break the rules
sometimes, right?

29:24.489 --> 29:26.075
You want some?

29:26.076 --> 29:28.246
Cal? Mary?

29:28.247 --> 29:29.750
No, no, no.

29:29.751 --> 29:30.752
And if you're gonna
drink alcohol,

29:30.753 --> 29:31.754
we're gonna leave.

29:31.755 --> 29:33.298
All right?

29:33.299 --> 29:34.508
 Not before I give you
your bonus.

29:34.509 --> 29:36.429
That's what you want, right?

29:36.430 --> 29:37.807
My money?

29:37.808 --> 29:39.227
As much as you can get?

29:42.108 --> 29:43.736
Here.  No.

29:43.737 --> 29:45.197
 Take it!

29:45.198 --> 29:47.242
 Harold...
I won't take your money.

29:47.243 --> 29:51.125
 Mary. Do you want Cal
to take my money?

29:51.126 --> 29:52.796
 Harold, Harold,
Harold, Harold...

29:52.797 --> 29:55.843
Put the money down.

29:55.844 --> 29:58.473
 What? No, Harold,
are you insane?

29:58.474 --> 30:00.143
 It's just fucking money,
right?

30:00.144 --> 30:02.272
Statistically, I'm gonna
be dead by 45 anyway.

30:02.273 --> 30:03.818
So who cares?  I fucking care.

30:03.819 --> 30:05.278
I grew up in a fucking
trailer park.

30:05.279 --> 30:06.782
I mean, you could feed

30:06.783 --> 30:08.034
forty homeless people
with that money.

30:08.035 --> 30:09.495
That's bullshit!

30:09.496 --> 30:11.543
 I made Mary mad.

30:13.087 --> 30:14.799
I don't want Mary
to be mad at me.

30:17.220 --> 30:18.806
 Don't you touch her!

30:18.807 --> 30:20.225
 We're gonna play chicken.

30:20.226 --> 30:21.687
Let's see how long

30:21.688 --> 30:22.814
Mary can hold her breath underwater.
I don't want to play.

30:22.815 --> 30:24.192
 Get off of her!

30:32.333 --> 30:33.501
 You are a fucking lunatic!

30:33.502 --> 30:35.715
 It was just a joke.

30:35.716 --> 30:37.050
You can't go!

30:37.051 --> 30:38.971
I'll kill myself! You can't go.

30:38.972 --> 30:40.766
 Then, God, just fucking do it!

30:40.767 --> 30:43.731
I am officially done
with your selfpity!

30:43.732 --> 30:45.610
So I'm gonna need you to

30:45.611 --> 30:47.822
sit your ass in this chair
for the next ten minutes,

30:47.823 --> 30:50.661
while my wife and my son and I
get out of here,

30:50.662 --> 30:52.999
and then you can do
whatever the hell you want.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.670
Good luck!

31:10.619 --> 31:12.245
Okay, you have everything?

31:12.246 --> 31:13.625
 

31:15.963 --> 31:17.924
Who's Jackson?

31:17.925 --> 31:21.263
 A Possible.

31:21.264 --> 31:22.642
 What's sushi?

31:22.643 --> 31:24.938
 Something an IS eats.

31:24.939 --> 31:26.483
Don't worry about it.

31:42.891 --> 31:44.728
 Daddy!

31:44.729 --> 31:46.857
 Hey, honey!

31:46.858 --> 31:50.280
 What is he still doing here?

31:50.281 --> 31:51.992
 Decided to let him stay.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.787
 Who?

31:53.788 --> 31:55.750
 A bad kid. He failed the ODE.

31:55.751 --> 31:58.504
 Look, I know that Steve

31:58.505 --> 32:00.216
really believed in that test,

32:00.217 --> 32:02.220
but I am thinking
of phasing it out.

32:02.221 --> 32:05.143
Okay? We shouldn't judge people
for their past.

32:05.144 --> 32:07.565
You, of all people,
should believe in that.

32:07.566 --> 32:08.609
 But you promised
that you would do

32:08.610 --> 32:09.736
what that test said.

32:09.737 --> 32:11.573
 I changed my mind.

32:11.574 --> 32:13.242
 Well, you just do
whatever you want, now, Eddie?

32:13.243 --> 32:14.871
You just want to be the guy
on the billboard?

32:14.872 --> 32:16.415
You wanna be a cult leader?
Is that it?

32:16.416 --> 32:18.377
 Sarah, Sarah,
just think about it.

32:18.378 --> 32:20.215
When Eddie opened the gates,
he opened them to everyone.

32:20.216 --> 32:22.135
It wouldn't look good
for him to kick someone out.

32:22.136 --> 32:24.682
-  Vera...
- .

32:24.683 --> 32:27.395
It would be bad press.
Is that it?

32:27.396 --> 32:29.734
I'm sorry,
what is your role here?

32:29.735 --> 32:31.571
I understand that you
want to sell green juice,

32:31.572 --> 32:32.949
but our movement is founded

32:32.950 --> 32:34.744
on sacred practices and rituals

32:34.745 --> 32:36.915
that you will never understand.

32:36.916 --> 32:39.378
 I'm just here to help Eddie
deliver his message. That's it.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.382
 And what is his message?

32:41.383 --> 32:43.637
That you're in charge here?
That nobody else has a voice?

32:43.638 --> 32:45.641
That nobody can disagree
with you?

32:45.642 --> 32:47.060
Got it.

32:47.061 --> 32:48.271
But as a mother,
I do have a voice,

32:48.272 --> 32:49.816
and as long as he is here,

32:49.817 --> 32:51.111
your daughter won't be.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.785
 Sarah...

33:17.121 --> 33:18.457
 I forgot his bag.

34:10.311 --> 34:11.855
What made you

34:11.856 --> 34:13.149
change your mind?
 My daughter wanted

34:13.150 --> 34:14.150
to stay with her grandparents,

34:14.152 --> 34:15.779
so, um...

34:15.780 --> 34:17.742
I found myself
with a free night.

34:17.743 --> 34:19.036
'Cause I'm free.

34:19.036 --> 34:20.455
To do whatever I want.

34:20.456 --> 34:21.583


34:21.583 --> 34:22.793
Yes, you are.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.922
Cheers.

34:27.512 --> 34:29.724
Thank you. Thank you very much.

34:29.725 --> 34:31.435
Here we go.

34:31.436 --> 34:33.774
...

34:33.775 --> 34:35.945


34:37.406 --> 34:39.786


34:39.786 --> 34:41.121
 You need a minute alone
with the...

34:41.121 --> 34:42.708
 I'm sorry.  Yellowtail?

34:42.708 --> 34:44.712
 You were telling me
about Kentucky.

34:44.713 --> 34:46.800
 That's where I grew up.

34:46.801 --> 34:48.637
Heart of the Bible Belt.

34:48.638 --> 34:50.389
Cuban mom, devout Catholic,

34:50.391 --> 34:52.476
Southern Methodist dad.

34:52.478 --> 34:54.607
There was a sign
across the street from

34:54.608 --> 34:55.943
my elementary school.

34:55.944 --> 34:57.278
"Go to church,

34:57.279 --> 34:58.574
or the Devil will find you."

34:59.993 --> 35:01.328
 Did he find you?

35:01.329 --> 35:03.416
 Yeah. Kind of.

35:03.417 --> 35:05.754
I was a real fuckup
in high school.

35:05.755 --> 35:07.675
Anyway,

35:07.676 --> 35:08.719
do you want some more?

35:08.720 --> 35:10.388
 Please.

35:10.389 --> 35:14.271
My parents wanted me
to be a priest, so...

35:14.272 --> 35:16.818
I went to seminary.

35:16.819 --> 35:19.532
 Really?  I know.

35:19.533 --> 35:21.619
The thing is,
the more that I learned,

35:21.620 --> 35:23.623
the more it kind of...

35:23.624 --> 35:27.422
just collapsed in on itself.

35:27.423 --> 35:29.134
I don't know.
That's what happens

35:29.135 --> 35:31.346
when you look too deep

35:31.347 --> 35:32.933
at this stuff, you know?

35:32.934 --> 35:34.812
 No.

35:34.813 --> 35:37.317
Actually, I've been...

35:37.318 --> 35:38.779
I have been going a bit back,

35:38.780 --> 35:39.781
and the further I go,

35:39.782 --> 35:42.327
the more I find...

35:42.328 --> 35:43.538
pure.

35:43.539 --> 35:44.791
  Fulfilling.

35:44.792 --> 35:46.961
 Really? Like what?

35:46.962 --> 35:48.673
 Just...

35:48.674 --> 35:52.556
rituals and practices, ways to

35:52.557 --> 35:54.142
reach a higher state of being.

35:54.143 --> 35:55.854
 Yes, the elusive

35:55.855 --> 35:57.106
"higher state of being,"

35:57.107 --> 35:59.612
whatever the fuck that means.

35:59.613 --> 36:02.367
 Well, obviously,
you've never been there.

36:02.368 --> 36:07.001
 So tell me, then:

36:07.002 --> 36:08.839
How do I get there?

36:08.840 --> 36:10.926
 Never mind.  I mean it.

36:10.927 --> 36:13.056
How do I get there?

36:19.820 --> 36:22.741
 I recently came across

36:22.742 --> 36:24.537
something that Steve used to use

36:24.538 --> 36:27.668
in the early days
of the religion.

36:27.669 --> 36:29.922
Something that was written out

36:29.923 --> 36:32.720
that he referred to as the.

36:32.721 --> 36:34.472
"Hypoxian Cleanse."

36:34.473 --> 36:37.437
 Hypoxian Cleanse.
 Where he'd bind himself.

36:37.438 --> 36:39.482
And take his breath.

36:39.483 --> 36:42.030
 Autoerotic asphyxiation.

36:42.031 --> 36:43.826
 No, it was punishment.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.961
But it was quite transcendent.

36:51.592 --> 36:54.387
 You've tried it?

36:54.388 --> 36:57.811
 No.

36:57.812 --> 37:00.651
 So...

37:00.652 --> 37:03.865
What else have you not tried
recently?

37:03.866 --> 37:06.119
 Nothing.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.748
 Okay.  Why?

37:07.749 --> 37:10.086
 I... justI'm curious.

37:10.087 --> 37:11.923
Listen, if the Hypoxian Cleanse
is in there,

37:11.924 --> 37:15.013
who knows what else there is?

37:18.353 --> 37:20.691
 This is awesome!

37:20.692 --> 37:22.778
See? 20 minutes
outside the city,

37:22.779 --> 37:24.865
different world.
 You were right.

37:24.866 --> 37:26.995
You actually were right.  

37:26.996 --> 37:28.372
 This is so beautiful.

37:28.373 --> 37:30.334
I have never seen this much sky.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.671
Like, ever.

37:31.672 --> 37:33.675
Hey, what's up?

37:33.676 --> 37:35.721
This is where you're from?

37:35.722 --> 37:39.352
... My house
is just down the street,

37:39.353 --> 37:41.481
but yeah.

37:41.482 --> 37:44.947
Yeah.  No wonder.

37:44.948 --> 37:45.991
 No wonder what?

37:45.992 --> 37:49.456


37:49.457 --> 37:50.625
 I wanna sing.

37:50.626 --> 37:51.961
Hey.

37:51.962 --> 37:53.505
- I wanna sing.
-  Okay.

37:53.506 --> 37:55.092
 We should start
a MusaMeyerist band.

37:55.093 --> 37:57.430
 No, no.  Yes, yes!

37:57.431 --> 38:00.521
Dee plays the drums! Come on!
 That's a terrible idea.

38:11.209 --> 38:13.379
 What do you want?

38:16.052 --> 38:18.640
 Hey.

38:18.641 --> 38:20.560
Logan, right?

38:20.561 --> 38:22.689
I'm, I'm Hawk.

38:22.690 --> 38:24.484
Eddie's son.

38:24.485 --> 38:26.404
Welcome.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.658
 Can you guys keep it down
a little bit?

38:27.659 --> 38:28.701
You're right outside my room.

38:28.702 --> 38:31.206
 Yes, of course. Sorry.

38:31.207 --> 38:33.210
Sorry about that.

38:33.211 --> 38:36.258
Seriously?  Joy, shut up.

38:36.259 --> 38:37.928
 No. He's a Nazi,

38:37.929 --> 38:39.472
and he's gonna get mad at us
for singing?

38:39.473 --> 38:41.059
 He is not a Nazi.

38:41.060 --> 38:42.604
 What's the deal
with your tattoo, then?

38:42.605 --> 38:44.107
 Nothing. It doesn't
mean anything.

38:44.108 --> 38:45.652
 Well, it's not nothing,
right? Last time

38:45.653 --> 38:46.821
I checked,
it was a symbol of hatred.

38:46.822 --> 38:48.616
 Whatever you say. Jesus.

38:48.617 --> 38:49.660
 Like the opposite
of everything we stand for.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.079
 All right. Okay. Okay.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.376
Just leave him alone. Yeah?

38:55.338 --> 38:57.676
Look, I'll make sure
they stay quiet.

38:57.677 --> 38:59.262
Why don't you just
go back to your dorm?

38:59.263 --> 39:00.640
 But I wasn't doing anything
 I know,

39:00.641 --> 39:02.519
but they'rethey're drunk,

39:02.520 --> 39:04.355
they're being idiots,
I'll talk to my dad tomorrow.

39:04.356 --> 39:06.234
 Hawk Lane, foot soldier,
reporting for duty.

39:06.235 --> 39:07.779
 I didn't do anything wrong.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.157
Yeah, except
he's a fucking racist!

39:09.158 --> 39:10.492
 I didn't do anything!

39:10.493 --> 39:12.413
 Good? You okay?  I'm fine.

39:12.414 --> 39:14.292
 He's not worth it.

39:14.293 --> 39:15.922
Never were, were you?

39:17.634 --> 39:19.053


39:25.065 --> 39:28.863


39:28.864 --> 39:29.990
 Hey!

39:29.991 --> 39:31.409
 Hey, my god!

39:31.410 --> 39:32.453
 Hey, hey, hey!

39:32.454 --> 39:33.873
 Get off of him!

39:33.874 --> 39:35.711
 Hey, hey, come on!  Stop it!

39:38.926 --> 39:40.094
 Argh!

39:40.095 --> 39:41.096
 Get the fuck off of him!

39:41.097 --> 39:42.724
Hey, stop!

39:42.725 --> 39:45.397
  Are you okay?

40:07.734 --> 40:08.776
 You okay?

40:08.777 --> 40:10.363
 Yep.

40:12.785 --> 40:16.709
 Look, Hawk, I never meant
for any of this

40:16.710 --> 40:19.213
to happen, all right?

40:19.214 --> 40:22.763
Especially to you.

40:22.764 --> 40:24.976
 I'm not supposed to matter
more than anyone else.

40:30.863 --> 40:32.365
Dad, don't...

40:32.366 --> 40:35.663
Don't do this
just because of me.

40:35.664 --> 40:39.546
 It's not just because
of you, Hawk.

40:39.547 --> 40:43.303
All right? This is his one
fucking chance.

40:43.304 --> 40:46.227


40:56.957 --> 40:58.710
It's that one.

41:08.187 --> 41:10.358
 Do you want me
to go in with you?

41:13.657 --> 41:17.748
Look, I'm sorry
that this happened.

41:19.126 --> 41:21.923
 I told you.

41:24.804 --> 41:27.684
 Logan, look.

41:27.685 --> 41:31.817
You can be loved.

41:31.818 --> 41:34.155
You can.

41:34.156 --> 41:36.035
You have it in you.

42:03.381 --> 42:05.843
 Sarah!

42:05.844 --> 42:09.101
Sweetie, can you bring us
the other bag of peas?

42:11.565 --> 42:14.904
Sarah?

43:12.687 --> 43:15.148
 You should call a plumber.

43:15.149 --> 43:17.236
 We don't call people for help.

43:17.237 --> 43:18.739
We fix things ourselves.

43:18.740 --> 43:20.242
I taught you how to
change a tire,

43:20.243 --> 43:22.454
I taught you how to
fix the sink.

43:22.455 --> 43:24.291
The way people waste money
in this country...

43:24.292 --> 43:27.757
 I can't get it to work!

43:27.758 --> 43:29.803
 Try again.

43:29.804 --> 43:31.222
 This is a waste of time.

43:31.223 --> 43:32.474
You have a super.
You have people

43:32.475 --> 43:34.437
to do things for you. I can't

43:34.438 --> 43:35.857
come running to you every time
you have a paper cut.

43:35.858 --> 43:37.317
It's not my job.

43:37.318 --> 43:39.155
 Nobody does anything right
anymore.

43:39.156 --> 43:41.117
You saw Bridgeport.
They'll never finish in time,

43:41.118 --> 43:42.662
and it's their own fault.

43:42.663 --> 43:45.877
I told them, the martyrdom
is coming.

43:45.878 --> 43:48.257
Sooner than expected.

43:50.971 --> 43:53.142
 Just try it again.

43:57.192 --> 43:58.234
 It's fixed.

43:58.235 --> 44:00.574
See? We don't need help.

44:07.797 --> 44:10.383
 Does he have to die?

44:10.384 --> 44:11.970
 Yes.

44:11.971 --> 44:15.311
Eddie has to die so we can live.

44:25.122 --> 44:28.086
 What you said to Harold...

44:28.087 --> 44:30.633
 Yeah.

44:30.634 --> 44:32.555
 You called me your wife.

44:35.351 --> 44:38.064
 Right. Um...

44:38.065 --> 44:40.653
Well...

44:40.654 --> 44:43.033
That's how I think about you.

44:45.664 --> 44:49.420
 Where are we going?

44:49.421 --> 44:51.257
 New York.

44:51.258 --> 44:53.052
 Back to the compound?

44:53.053 --> 44:56.100
 It's mine.

44:56.101 --> 44:57.562
They owe me.

44:57.563 --> 44:59.984
Steve owes me.

45:03.658 --> 45:05.704
 So...  So I'm taking it back.

45:10.672 --> 45:14.054
'Cause I earned it.

45:19.607 --> 45:22.613
 Shh. It's okay.

45:26.829 --> 45:30.711
