12:33.671 --> 12:36.132
I was just legitimately surprised to see him
at orientation

12:36.341 --> 12:38.843
because it's not like
he was ever there for Abigail's first day.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.931
- And Bonnie is his new wife?
- Yeah, she's the very pretty one.

12:43.973 --> 12:47.852
In fact, she's so pretty and free spirited
and Bohemian

12:47.936 --> 12:50.605
and all loving that sometimes I just want to...

12:50.939 --> 12:52.440
Punch her in the face?

12:53.149 --> 12:54.192
Hey.

12:54.609 --> 12:56.527
You're gonna love this girl.

12:57.612 --> 12:58.947
Oh. Good, they saved my spot.

12:59.864 --> 13:01.282
- Hello, Tom.
- TOM: Madeline.

13:01.783 --> 13:03.034
What's happened to you?

13:03.284 --> 13:05.870
I've gravely injured myself.
I've twisted my ankle.

13:05.995 --> 13:07.497
Come meet my new friend, Jane.

13:08.039 --> 13:09.290
CELESTE: Here, sit down.

13:10.041 --> 13:12.210
MADELINE:
This is my knight in shining armor.

13:13.378 --> 13:15.505
She rescued me
like a wounded dog in the street.

13:15.964 --> 13:18.466
- Hi.
- And you know what else? She's funny.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.719
- It's nice to meet you, funny Jane.
- Nice to meet you.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.555
I think she just moved to this area
for your delicious coffee.

13:25.139 --> 13:26.391
So do you mind getting three...

13:26.516 --> 13:28.142
- Would you like one?
- Yeah.

13:28.226 --> 13:29.310
Three, please.

13:29.394 --> 13:32.146
And will you throw in something chocolate
that won't make my ass look fat?

13:32.230 --> 13:33.356
- You got it.
- Thank you.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.026
Everybody moves here for the education.

13:38.319 --> 13:41.239
Basically, it's private school
at a public school price.

13:41.322 --> 13:43.574
Anyway, you're gonna to love it. Do you surf?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.576
Do you have a husband or...

13:45.660 --> 13:48.413
I shouldn't assume. Boyfriend, girlfriend.
I'm open to all possibilities.

13:48.496 --> 13:50.915
No. No husband or partner. Just me.

13:50.999 --> 13:53.084
- What about Ziggy's dad?
- Easy, girl.

13:53.167 --> 13:55.003
- Okay. I'm just wondering.
-It's fine.

13:55.086 --> 13:56.337
He's not in the picture.

13:56.421 --> 13:58.256
He was actually never in the picture.
We weren't together.

13:58.381 --> 13:59.424
Really?

13:59.507 --> 14:01.092
- Where'd you move here from?
- Just Santa Cruz.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.593
I was up there with my parents.

14:02.719 --> 14:05.596
You know, she does part-time bookkeeping
as well. Isn't that great?

14:06.097 --> 14:08.433
You know, I work at the theater,
and whenever we go into production,

14:08.516 --> 14:11.519
we hire freelance accountants,
so I'll ask them if they have anything for you.

14:12.437 --> 14:14.939
You're so nice. Thank you.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.860
- This is Monterey. We pound people with nice.
- To death.

14:21.612 --> 14:22.739
What?

14:23.114 --> 14:24.866
What do I know of Jane Chapman?

14:25.033 --> 14:26.617
Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

14:27.035 --> 14:28.036
MADELINEI You okay?

14:28.119 --> 14:30.621
Nobody knows nothing about anybody.

14:31.289 --> 14:34.542
You can write that down, Detective,
and underline it.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.252
MADELINEI What is it, honey?

14:36.544 --> 14:37.879
JANE: It's weird.

14:38.296 --> 14:42.800
Sometimes, when I'm in a new place,
I get this sensation.

14:43.134 --> 14:45.053
Like, "if only I were here."

14:46.596 --> 14:48.890
- But you are here.
- I know.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.810
It's like I'm on the outside looking in, or like...

14:53.311 --> 14:56.481
You know, like I see this life and this moment,
and it's so wonderful,

14:57.774 --> 14:59.776
but it doesn't quite belong to me.

15:02.445 --> 15:03.821
Does that make any sense?

15:05.448 --> 15:06.574
Yeah.

15:07.492 --> 15:09.243
- Are you following this?
- Yeah.

15:10.244 --> 15:13.164
And, like, I look at you,
and you're so beautiful.

15:13.289 --> 15:14.332
- MADELINE: That's true.
- Stop.

15:14.415 --> 15:17.585
And I'm not saying that
to embarrass you at all, but it is true.

15:18.002 --> 15:20.505
- You are, and so are you, and...
- I agree.

15:21.005 --> 15:22.507
You guys are just right.

15:23.132 --> 15:24.675
You're exactly right.

15:25.009 --> 15:28.763
And for some reason,
that makes me feel wrong, I guess.

15:29.138 --> 15:31.432
-It's crazy. I know I sound crazy.
-It's not crazy.

15:31.516 --> 15:33.101
I mean,
I have no idea what you're talking about,

15:33.184 --> 15:36.771
but if you were crazy, you'd fit in perfectly
in this town. Right, Tom?

15:38.689 --> 15:40.358
MADELINE: We love crazy people here.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.026
TOM: We love our crazy.
Here's your cupcake.

She can be hostile with me, but not you.

16:57.768 --> 17:00.688
You think she should keep
all of her emotions bottled up inside?

17:00.771 --> 17:02.607
- Who does that serve?
-"Am I missing the math?"

17:03.774 --> 17:04.942

17:05.276 --> 17:07.069
Can't she see
that it has nothing to do with you?

17:07.153 --> 17:10.656
None of us really see things as they are.
We see things as we are.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.657
Come on, Bonnie. Give me a break.

17:12.742 --> 17:14.035
The kids are in the same class together.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.871
Madeline's eventually gonna discover
how smart you are, and when she does,

17:16.954 --> 17:18.372
shit's gonna hit the fan.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.917
The shit is really gonna hit the fan
if I don't tell her about this petition.

17:22.001 --> 17:23.169
No.

17:23.461 --> 17:27.214
Everyone knew Nathan was
a little bit of a dick, but a likeable one.

17:27.298 --> 17:28.966
I never liked him.

17:29.675 --> 17:31.302
I liked his Wife.

17:51.697 --> 17:52.782
Hi.

17:53.074 --> 17:54.158
(LAUGHS)

17:54.242 --> 17:55.618
- How was it?
- Fun.

17:55.701 --> 17:57.078
- Yeah?
- I made friends.

17:57.161 --> 17:59.330
You made friends? You already made friends?

17:59.413 --> 18:00.873
That is so exciting.

18:02.625 --> 18:03.876
Hi, guys.

18:05.086 --> 18:06.254
Hi.

18:06.796 --> 18:09.173
Mmm, I missed you. Oh!

18:09.590 --> 18:11.259
MADELINE: Now, where is the Chloe?

18:11.884 --> 18:13.552
Chloe. Of course, she's networking.

18:14.387 --> 18:15.429
Hi.

18:16.055 --> 18:17.223
Okay.

18:17.932 --> 18:21.644
I just want to introduce you to Juliette.
This is my Amabella's nanny.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.145
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

18:23.229 --> 18:24.480
She's French.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.190
It's good for them to learn a language,
you know?

18:26.274 --> 18:28.651
I just thought it was nice for the nannies
to get to know each other,

18:28.734 --> 18:31.237
-have your own little support system.
- Renata, Jane is not a nanny.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.155
She's a mom, just young.

18:33.239 --> 18:35.616
- Like you used to be.
- Oh. Like we used to be?

18:36.575 --> 18:37.994
- Sorry, l...
- Maddie, hi.

18:38.077 --> 18:39.787
BONNIE: I heard you're working
at the community theater.

18:39.870 --> 18:41.497
I wanted to talk to you about the petition.

18:42.415 --> 18:43.833
About the play.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.835
There's been some concern
about it being appropriate.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.087
There's a petition to stop the play?

18:48.170 --> 18:51.173
That play was
kind of like a lifeline for Madeline.

18:52.008 --> 18:53.509
It tethered her to a purpose.

18:53.759 --> 18:54.844
I signed it.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.304
MS. BARNES: Excuse me!

18:56.387 --> 18:57.430
- You signed it?
- I did.

18:57.513 --> 18:58.597
I didn't know you were involved, though...

18:58.681 --> 19:01.058
MS BARNES: Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention for a moment?

19:01.142 --> 19:02.184
She grew up wanting to be Betty Grable.

19:02.268 --> 19:03.561
<i>MS BARNES: All my first-grade kiddos...</i>

19:03.644 --> 19:05.021
Ended up Betty Crocker.

19:05.104 --> 19:07.023
- Chloe, come on.
-...and their parents, please.

19:07.106 --> 19:08.983
- I'm here.
- Hi, Chloe.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.276
Wonderful.

19:10.359 --> 19:16.365
Okay.
We have had such a wonderful morning.

19:16.449 --> 19:20.619
But we need to have a little chat,
and it's a little bit serious, okay?

19:21.329 --> 19:24.206
Someone hurt Anabella.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.876
- Oh.
- MS BARNES: Excuse me. Amabella.

19:26.959 --> 19:31.339
And I would like whoever it was
to come over and apologize,

19:31.422 --> 19:35.051
okay, because we don't hurt our friends
at school, do we?

19:35.634 --> 19:36.802
- No.
- MS BARNES: No, we don't.

19:36.886 --> 19:40.431
And if we do, we always say...

19:40.973 --> 19:42.600
- KIDS: Sorry.
- Sorry. That's right.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.978
Because that's what
big first-grade children do, right?

19:46.604 --> 19:48.272
Yeah. Yeah.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.359
Baby, someone hurt you?

19:51.442 --> 19:53.736
Amabella, do you think
it was an accident maybe?

19:53.819 --> 19:57.323
An accident? Look at her neck for God's sake.
It has marks on it.

19:58.157 --> 20:01.285
Amabella, sweetie,
can you tell me if it was a boy or a girl?

20:01.786 --> 20:03.829
- It was a boy.
-It was a boy?

20:04.330 --> 20:07.166
- What was his name?
- Maybe she doesn't want to say.

20:07.249 --> 20:12.129
Mrs. Klein, my problem is that the children
don't know one another's names yet,

20:12.213 --> 20:14.298
so Amabella cannot tell me who...

20:14.382 --> 20:17.176
- We're not gonna just let this go.
- Absolutely not.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.472
Mrs. Klein, I'm so sorry.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.140
Is she okay?

20:23.432 --> 20:26.185
I don't know. They're gonna find out.
Just give her a second.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.397
- Did you see what happened?
- No.

20:29.605 --> 20:31.232
- RENATA: You're her teacher.
- MS. BARNES: You know what.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.608
- You should be doing something.
- Um... Uh,

20:33.275 --> 20:37.571
Amabella, sweetie, could you maybe point
to the boy who hurt you.

20:38.155 --> 20:39.740
Come on, really?

20:48.833 --> 20:50.209
- This boy?
- No.

20:50.751 --> 20:51.877
Him.

20:53.421 --> 20:56.006
- This boy?
- AMABELLA: Yes, he tried to choke me.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.883
- What?
- ZIGGY: it wasn't me.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.218
AMABELLAI Yes, it was.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.720
MS. BARNES: Ziggy, sweetie,
we just need you to say sorry.

21:02.221 --> 21:03.556
I didn't do anything.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.101
(WHISPERS) I didn't.

21:07.977 --> 21:10.688
Are you sure
that it was this little boy, sweetie?

21:13.232 --> 21:14.567
Could she have got it wrong?

21:15.401 --> 21:17.653
Can you say you're sorry to Amabella?

21:17.736 --> 21:19.780
- She's hurt quite badly.
- ZIGGY: It wasn't me.

21:19.864 --> 21:21.407
Ziggy, look at me.

21:22.366 --> 21:23.951
- Promise.
- RENATA: We don't have to lie.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.619
We just want to say we're sorry.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.122
- Ziggy doesn't lie.
- Right.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.166
I can assure you, Amabella's telling the truth.

21:30.249 --> 21:32.585
- If my son says he didn't do it, I believe him.
- Of course.

21:32.960 --> 21:37.006
You know what? I don't know
if this is the best way to deal with this, so...

21:37.089 --> 21:39.091
I agree, but now we are,

21:39.175 --> 21:42.344
so maybe the child needs
to take responsibility for his actions.

21:43.053 --> 21:45.473
And he needs to see there are consequences.

21:45.556 --> 21:49.727
Little boys don't get to go around anymore
hurting little girls.

21:49.810 --> 21:52.062
And none of us want to raise bullies, so...

21:52.146 --> 21:54.565
We don't have to pretend we didn't do it.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.692
It's okay. I believe you.

21:56.775 --> 22:00.196
- Jane, can you just make your son apologize?
- MADELINE: Renata.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.614
Stay out of it.

22:02.239 --> 22:04.700
I can't make him apologize
for something that I know he didn't do.

22:04.783 --> 22:07.369
- Of course you can't.
- We will schedule a meeting for another time.

22:07.453 --> 22:09.622
- We can handle this later.
- RENATA: Okay.

22:10.122 --> 22:12.625
This is unacceptable. Let's go, baby.
Let's go, sweet pea.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.835
- MS BARNES: All right, everyone, thank you.
- I'm so sorry, honey.

22:14.919 --> 22:19.131
Not that there's a right little girl to strangle,
but he picked the wrong little girl to strangle.

22:19.215 --> 22:20.841
Ziggy-

22:20.925 --> 22:22.593
Do you see her neck?

22:23.302 --> 22:27.556
If you ever touch my little girl like that again,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.308
- Excuse me.
- Well...

22:29.558 --> 22:31.227
Now you owe him an apology.

22:31.310 --> 22:32.686
- Madeline!
- Renata!

22:32.770 --> 22:34.939
The battle lines were drawn right there.

22:35.397 --> 22:39.485
We've never had a Trivia Night
end in bloodshed before.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.987
MADELINE:
How dare she speak to a child like that?

22:42.279 --> 22:45.241
I mean, isn't there some sort of
students' bill of rights?

22:45.324 --> 22:47.576
Celeste used to be a lawyer,
a very good lawyer.

22:47.660 --> 22:50.704
I mean, isn't there due process
for a first grader? Am I wrong?

22:50.788 --> 22:52.581
Well, he's not being punished, so...

22:52.665 --> 22:54.667
Well, he's being stigmatized as a bully,
and that's worse.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.585
I think we should not make
a big deal out of this. Just...

22:56.669 --> 22:57.920
Madeline.

22:58.754 --> 23:00.047
Harper Stimson, hi.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.423
Jane just didn't fit here.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.176
Kind of like a dirty old Prius
parked outside of Barneys.

23:06.345 --> 23:11.392
It was a mistake to let people compete,
but that is not what got someone killed.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.018
HARPER: Hi, Celeste. How's Perry?

23:13.852 --> 23:15.437
Oh, uh. He's good. Thank you.

23:16.605 --> 23:18.857
- HARPER: If it'll help...
- MADELINE: You didn't ask me how Ed was.

23:20.526 --> 23:21.777
I'm sorry.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.988
Listen, Renata happens to be
one of my best friends,

23:24.071 --> 23:27.533
so if there's any way I can play the role
of peacemaker in all this, just please...

23:27.616 --> 23:29.368
Thank you, Harper.
That's very sweet of you to offer.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.871
And I'll make sure and let everybody know
that Renata is your best friend.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.376
I'm only trying to help.

23:37.626 --> 23:38.919
MADELINE: I'm sure you are.

23:41.547 --> 23:43.132
This could get ugly.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.633
We could just let it blow over.

23:44.717 --> 23:47.886
Things never blow over
once Madeline gets involved.

I take it this Jane is kind of damaged.

24:49.114 --> 24:50.324
Why do you say that?

24:51.241 --> 24:53.619
- You're drawn to damaged people.
- I am not.

24:54.453 --> 24:58.040
Even Celeste, there's something
wounded about her, if you ask me.

24:58.123 --> 25:02.086
I didn't ask,
and I'm not drawn to damaged people.

25:02.169 --> 25:04.588
Do I like to help people in need? Yes.

Last time I checked,
that's not a character flaw.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.512
- MADELINE: I see that look.
- Hmm.

25:11.804 --> 25:14.264
I just think,
to be accused of something so horrible

25:14.348 --> 25:16.642
on your very first day at a new school,

25:16.725 --> 25:19.353
-can you imagine anything worse?
- ABIGAIL: Mmm...

25:19.895 --> 25:21.647
Being choked, maybe?

25:22.272 --> 25:25.359
Bruises heal. Stigmas can last a lifetime.

25:26.193 --> 25:29.321
ABIGAIL: You don't think assault victims
bear lifetime emotional injuries?

25:31.156 --> 25:35.077
I don't know. ls there a recent study you'd
like to illuminate the family about, Abigail?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.662
- All right.
-"All right" what?

25:37.287 --> 25:38.706
Nothing.

25:38.789 --> 25:41.083
Well, it's not nothing. It's something.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.418
You said, "All right."

25:42.501 --> 25:45.337
Would you like to assign meaning to that,
or was it just a nervous tic?

25:46.004 --> 25:47.381
CHLOE: Guys, Mom had a day.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.757
And don't you start.

25:48.841 --> 25:50.050
I'm on your side, woman.

25:50.134 --> 25:52.469
- I'm gonna go with "nervous tic."
- ABIGAIL: Mmm.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.848
I think his "all right" meant,
"Let's not fight at the dinner table."

25:56.432 --> 25:57.766
Were we fighting?

25:57.850 --> 26:00.519
- I didn't realize we were fighting.
- We were about to.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.896
You said I probably read some study
on women assault victims,

26:02.980 --> 26:04.022
and I would've responded with,

26:04.106 --> 26:06.525
"No, I learned it
at my self-defense and wellness class,"

26:06.608 --> 26:08.527
which happens to be taught by Bonnie,

26:08.610 --> 26:10.738
who, by the very mention of her name,
makes your eyes twitch,

26:10.821 --> 26:13.907
so Ed said "all right" to head it off.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.159
I see.

26:15.242 --> 26:17.745
Well, speaking of Bonnie,
do you know what she did today?

26:18.704 --> 26:22.791
She signed a petition to stop our production
of Avenue Q.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.169
This is the play
where the puppets drop the f-bombs?

26:25.252 --> 26:27.629
- Cool.
-It is not only not about that,

26:27.713 --> 26:29.214
but it's actually a play that you should see

26:29.298 --> 26:32.760
because it deals with the struggle
of young adults being

26:32.843 --> 26:34.470
-disillusioned with life...
- Hmm.

26:34.553 --> 26:38.098
...feeling demoralized and defrauded
by the false promises of tomorrow.

26:40.392 --> 26:41.935

27:07.753 --> 27:08.837

No, I still have to go.

- Yes.

27:49.044 --> 27:50.379

and peeled potatoes at a homeless shelter,

28:11.483 --> 28:15.112
and she couldn't stop talking about what
a beautiful experience it was to contribute.

28:15.988 --> 28:20.576
I mean, she whines if I ask her to set the table,
but peel one fucking potato with Bonnie...

28:22.077 --> 28:24.121
Well, Bonnie is a positive influence.

28:26.123 --> 28:29.251
What, you'd rather Abby be out
with her friends smoking pot?

28:31.211 --> 28:33.505
I just feel like they're both slipping away.

28:33.964 --> 28:35.173
You should've seen Chloe today.

28:35.257 --> 28:39.678
She just marched right into that school
like some sort of a woman-child.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.597
She never turned around.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.433
And it was like she was on her own.
"Bye, Mom. See you later."

28:47.394 --> 28:50.355
I just feel like they're gonna grow up,
and they're gonna be gone,

28:51.356 --> 28:54.651
and it'll just be you and I, and we're gonna be
on to another chapter of our life,

28:54.985 --> 28:57.571
and you have another chapter.
You have a business.

28:58.196 --> 29:01.825

29:03.702 --> 29:07.247
This is my universe, and currently,
that universe is in meltdown

29:07.331 --> 29:10.792
because my oldest daughter prefers
to hang out with her fucking step-thing.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.837
Hey. You will never lose them.

29:15.297 --> 29:16.924
And you know that.

29:17.007 --> 29:19.343
I just thought
one day Nathan would get his due.

29:19.927 --> 29:22.679
For some reason,
Abigail would love me more.

29:23.597 --> 29:26.266
He hasn't paid in the slightest, for any of it.

29:26.975 --> 29:31.563
And now he's got Bonnie,
and she's younger and sexier and prettier,

29:31.647 --> 29:34.650
and she probably gives mint-flavored
organic blowjobs.

29:35.442 --> 29:38.487
And Abigail likes to hang out with him
and be buddies.

29:38.570 --> 29:41.490
And he got it all. He won.

29:44.493 --> 29:48.872
Okay. Well, speaking as the consolation prize,

29:49.373 --> 29:51.375

-...but not tonight.

- Not tonight.

when she's physically assaulted.

is that, when it all comes down to it,

37:51.813 --> 37:54.816
you have to be independent,

go poof in your face,

38:04.659 --> 38:07.245

38:07.328 --> 38:11.249
