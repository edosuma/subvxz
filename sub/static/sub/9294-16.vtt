00:16.338 --> 00:17.640
No!

00:17.760 --> 00:19.652
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

00:19.772 --> 00:22.015
- He's dead.
- Are you telling me

00:22.084 --> 00:23.984
that Jack Bauer just killed

00:24.052 --> 00:25.986
a United States senator?

00:26.054 --> 00:27.421
How could you have let
this happen?!

00:27.489 --> 00:29.690
Mr. Kanin, you are not going
to lay this one at my feet.

00:29.757 --> 00:32.192
What is it, Ethan, what's wrong?

00:32.259 --> 00:33.827
<i>Madam President,
I'm afraid I have no choice</i>

00:33.895 --> 00:36.029
but to resign
as your chief of staff.

00:36.098 --> 00:38.265
You're taking this too far.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.267
<i>- Where's Jack?
- We don't have him.</i>

00:40.335 --> 00:41.335
<i>The man</i>

00:41.403 --> 00:42.769
who framed Jack
for Burnett's murder was

00:42.837 --> 00:45.068
John Quinn,
a Starkwood contractor.

00:45.188 --> 00:47.040
Jack went to Mayer
to get the evidence

00:47.109 --> 00:48.542
to prove it.

00:48.610 --> 00:49.776
Starkwood was involved
with everything

00:49.844 --> 00:51.212
that's happened today.
They were the ones

00:51.279 --> 00:53.114
that helped Juma and his men
bring down the planes and attack

00:53.181 --> 00:54.248
the White House.

00:54.316 --> 00:55.616
In exchange,
they were allowed to develop

00:55.683 --> 00:58.319
and manufacture a WMD
in Sangala.

00:58.386 --> 01:00.387
<i>The text message I got
off their agent's cell phone</i>

01:00.455 --> 01:02.156
said "Port of Alexandria,

01:02.224 --> 01:04.325
lot "C," 10:15 p.m."

01:04.391 --> 01:06.727
Go red, go red!
Engage, engage.

01:15.036 --> 01:16.670
<i>Get that truck
out of here now!</i>

01:16.738 --> 01:18.172
Tony!
The truck--

01:18.240 --> 01:19.173
I'm going after it!

01:19.241 --> 01:20.274
Cover me now!

01:31.153 --> 01:32.353
I'm in possession
of a biological weapon

01:32.420 --> 01:33.854
interdicted
at the Port of Alexandria.

01:50.138 --> 01:52.005
What's your status?

01:52.073 --> 01:53.340
<i>Package is secure;
we're inbound.</i>

01:53.408 --> 01:54.343
What about Bauer?

01:54.463 --> 01:55.543
He's at the scene, sir,

01:55.610 --> 01:56.877
but he sought cover nearby.

01:56.944 --> 01:59.346
We have to assume that
he contacted the authorities,

01:59.414 --> 02:01.649
so we'd better be
on an accelerated timetable.

02:01.716 --> 02:03.184
Get over here.

02:03.251 --> 02:04.885
Starkwood reacquired
the bioweapon.

02:04.952 --> 02:06.620
They airlifted the freight
right out of here.

02:06.688 --> 02:08.556
They were headed due west
from my current position.

02:08.622 --> 02:09.990
Jack, I can't assault
a private compound

02:10.058 --> 02:11.727
unless I have proof
that a weapon exists.

02:11.847 --> 02:13.294
Okay, where is the CDC?

02:13.361 --> 02:14.695
They're scrambling a team
right now.

02:14.762 --> 02:15.762
Send them to me.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.494
You'll have
all the proof you need.

02:17.614 --> 02:18.499
Jack, what happened?

02:18.567 --> 02:20.668
I was exposed.

02:39.987 --> 02:42.089
We're ready for you, sir,
come with me.

02:54.068 --> 02:55.168
<i>Mr. Bauer.</i>

02:55.237 --> 02:57.003
Dr. Macer, CDC.

02:57.071 --> 02:58.772
We need you to
get undressed.

03:01.909 --> 03:04.278
You're the one
that talked to Agent Moss?

03:04.346 --> 03:05.579
He brought me up to speed,

03:05.647 --> 03:07.381
said you had some information
about the bioweapon.

03:07.449 --> 03:09.916
All I know is that it was
developed in Sangala,

03:09.984 --> 03:11.852
and according to rumors
from the village

03:11.919 --> 03:13.086
that it was tested on,

03:13.154 --> 03:15.165
all the victims suffered
from dementia and paralysis.

03:15.285 --> 03:17.413
Check neurological
vectors and pathogens.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.192
How much was released?

03:19.261 --> 03:21.729
I'm not exactly sure.

03:21.796 --> 03:23.718
The weapon was stored
in a pressurized canister.

03:23.838 --> 03:25.566
It was breached
for maybe two minutes

03:25.634 --> 03:26.833
before I could seal it off.

03:33.875 --> 03:34.875
This is not
a reaction.

03:34.942 --> 03:36.143
I've had
these scars.

03:36.210 --> 03:39.194
This is a full
spectrum antibiotic.

03:39.314 --> 03:40.113
It should counteract

03:40.181 --> 03:42.190
a wide range of
known pathogens.

03:44.786 --> 03:46.887
Step inside, sir.

03:55.129 --> 03:58.198
Raise your arms and
close your eyes.

04:08.725 --> 04:09.359
Janis, where are we?

04:09.479 --> 04:12.212
Metro closed down a six-mile
stretch of Highway 236.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.147
The CDC first responders
are on-site. What the hell's

04:14.215 --> 04:15.596
going on?
One of the bioweapon canisters

04:15.716 --> 04:17.918
was breached.

04:17.985 --> 04:19.084
Jack may have been exposed.

04:19.153 --> 04:22.022
Oh, my God.
Starkwood took the canisters.

04:22.089 --> 04:23.722
They're probably flying it
back to their main compound

04:23.842 --> 04:25.759
in Virginia, along
with Tony Almeida.

04:25.827 --> 04:27.453
Almeida?
Yeah, he was
working with Jack.

04:27.573 --> 04:28.862
We think he might have been
taken captive.

04:28.930 --> 04:30.597
Hang on one second. I
need you to put together

04:30.665 --> 04:31.732
a briefing packet
on Starkwood.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.367
I want every division
caught up to speed

04:33.435 --> 04:34.702
on what we might
be dealing with.

04:34.769 --> 04:35.869
You planning to
move on Starkwood?

04:35.937 --> 04:37.404
That place is enormous;
it's practically

04:37.472 --> 04:39.373
a military base.
We're not going to do anything

04:39.441 --> 04:41.208
till we have concrete evidence
on the bioweapon from CDC.

04:41.275 --> 04:42.676
Then I'll inform
the president.

04:42.744 --> 04:44.712
She'll decide
how to proceed.

05:25.086 --> 05:28.389
Almeida's not going
to talk.

05:28.456 --> 05:30.424
He's not the type;
he's the brave type.

05:30.492 --> 05:33.226
Know the psychology
of your subject.

05:33.294 --> 05:36.196
That's in our manual.

05:36.264 --> 05:37.865
Here we go.

05:43.471 --> 05:45.406
Mr. Hodges,

05:45.473 --> 05:47.941
we isolated
the damaged canister.

05:48.009 --> 05:49.476
We got lucky.

05:49.544 --> 05:51.077
They know we
have the weapons.

05:51.145 --> 05:52.245
That's not so lucky.

05:52.313 --> 05:53.480
How fast can you
have them ready?

05:53.548 --> 05:55.482
It's going to take me
at least two hours.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.284
Too long, Tom.
Sir, we don't know

05:57.351 --> 05:58.351
what the government knows.

05:58.420 --> 05:59.720
They're coming,
and they'll be coming

05:59.788 --> 06:02.088
with everything they've got,
and the only thing

06:02.156 --> 06:04.758
that's going to stop them
is getting these weapons ready

06:04.826 --> 06:05.826
to deploy.

06:05.894 --> 06:08.295
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

06:08.362 --> 06:10.864
I know you will.

06:16.771 --> 06:17.805
Okay, let's go!

06:33.354 --> 06:35.889
What does
the FBI know?

06:35.957 --> 06:37.491
I'm not going to
ask you again.

06:44.432 --> 06:46.266
Okay.

06:50.204 --> 06:51.705
You're a good man, Tony.

06:52.874 --> 06:54.842
I know your profile.

06:54.909 --> 06:56.710
You've had some
hard breaks.

06:56.778 --> 07:00.581
I don't want to see you hurt,

07:00.648 --> 07:02.483
so you just tell me
what the FBI knows

07:02.550 --> 07:05.953
about what we're
doing here,

07:06.020 --> 07:08.355
and I can't say you'll
walk away smiling--

07:08.422 --> 07:10.491
that would be
unrealistic--

07:10.558 --> 07:13.894
but you'll be alive.

07:15.663 --> 07:17.631
You hear me?

07:24.706 --> 07:30.143
But I don't know
anything, Mr. Hodges.

07:40.187 --> 07:44.791
I'm giving you
a way out, Tony.

07:44.859 --> 07:46.894
Sir,

07:46.961 --> 07:48.629
may I speak to you for a moment?

07:48.696 --> 07:51.364
Not now, Greg.

07:51.432 --> 07:52.699
Please, sir,

07:52.767 --> 07:54.167
just for a moment.

08:02.744 --> 08:04.678
What is it?

08:04.746 --> 08:07.836
This was supposed to
be a covert operation.

08:07.956 --> 08:08.742
That is not
the case

08:08.862 --> 08:09.750
anymore.

08:09.817 --> 08:11.718
The government knows
that we have these weapons,

08:11.786 --> 08:13.954
and they're not just going
to sit on that information.

08:15.056 --> 08:17.991
What are you suggesting, Greg?

08:18.059 --> 08:21.261
Maybe we should destroy
the evidence

08:21.328 --> 08:23.129
while we still have
some time.

08:24.165 --> 08:26.099
I can't believe

08:26.167 --> 08:28.802
that I'm hearing
this from you.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.037
I'm just trying
to help, sir.

08:30.104 --> 08:32.337
I care about this company
as much as you do.

08:32.405 --> 08:34.908
Oh, I doubt that.

08:34.976 --> 08:37.510
We've invested a lot
of blood and treasure

08:37.578 --> 08:39.947
to get these weapons, and I'm
not going to give them up.

08:41.982 --> 08:44.217
Think about what
you're risking, sir--

08:44.284 --> 08:47.287
everything,
everything you've built.

08:47.354 --> 08:49.022
You say you're
trying to help.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.724
You know what I think?

08:50.792 --> 08:52.459
I think you're worried
about your own ass.

08:52.526 --> 08:55.729
Get him out of here and
do what you have to do.

08:55.797 --> 08:58.632
Think about what I said,
young man.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.766
You're a little nervous,
Greg.

08:59.834 --> 09:01.001
Well, I've got a news flash:

09:01.069 --> 09:02.669
we're all nervous.

09:02.737 --> 09:04.471
Keep your doubts to yourself.

09:04.538 --> 09:06.974
I'm not going to tell you again.

09:10.678 --> 09:12.445
We're going to need to take
more blood and saliva samples,

09:12.513 --> 09:14.881
and I'd like to collect
a spinal fluid specimen.

09:14.949 --> 09:16.016
Until we know
what we're dealing with,

09:16.084 --> 09:17.517
we need to keep you
under quarantine.

09:17.585 --> 09:18.852
How long is it gonna be
till you know

09:18.920 --> 09:19.953
whether or not
I've been infected?

09:20.021 --> 09:21.488
We should have the
preliminary results

09:21.555 --> 09:22.823
in the next
15 minutes.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.024
Okay.
Dr. Macer,

09:24.092 --> 09:25.859
we've detected

09:25.927 --> 09:27.494
trace amounts of an
airborne pathogen.

09:27.561 --> 09:29.162
It's concentrated
near the truck.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.697
We're also picking it up in
the surrounding environments

09:30.765 --> 09:31.999
at much lower
concentrations.

09:32.066 --> 09:33.166
Can you identify it?

09:33.234 --> 09:34.701
No, but we're analyzing
a sample now.

09:34.769 --> 09:36.503
These levels shouldn't present
any danger

09:36.570 --> 09:37.704
to the nearby population,

09:37.772 --> 09:39.472
but I still want
atmospheric monitors set up.

09:39.540 --> 09:42.575
It's a good thing you sealed
off the canister, Mr. Bauer.

09:42.644 --> 09:44.911
You saved a
lot of lives.

09:44.979 --> 09:46.980
You're going to have
to transport me back to FBI.

09:47.048 --> 09:49.315
I'm still material evidence
in an ongoing terrorist threat.

09:49.383 --> 09:50.316
Those were
our orders.

09:50.384 --> 09:51.417
We can run our
tests from there.

09:51.485 --> 09:53.486
Okay.

09:57.792 --> 10:00.260
Bob Justman's been
associate counsel

10:00.327 --> 10:01.528
for the past three years.

10:01.595 --> 10:03.931
He and Ethan worked
very closely together.

10:04.051 --> 10:07.034
He is certainly qualified
to be chief of staff.

10:07.101 --> 10:08.735
But...

10:08.803 --> 10:11.204
After what's happened today,

10:11.272 --> 10:13.675
I think you should be looking
outside your administration.

10:13.795 --> 10:15.842
An insider has a leg up.

10:15.910 --> 10:19.846
Chief of staff has a
steep learning curve.

10:19.914 --> 10:22.200
I think you're underestimating

10:22.320 --> 10:23.950
the value
of a fresh perspective.

10:24.018 --> 10:26.553
You have
someone in mind.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.689
I do.

10:28.756 --> 10:29.890
Rick Berman.

10:33.194 --> 10:35.975
Would Rick even consider leaving
the private sector?

10:36.095 --> 10:37.230
Well, he's made his fortune.

10:37.298 --> 10:39.232
I think he'd jump at the
chance to serve his country.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.600
Let's sit down with him.

10:40.668 --> 10:42.202
Great.

10:42.269 --> 10:43.564
But keep Bob on the list.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.173
I still have a good feeling
about him.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.875
I'll start to set up
meetings tomorrow.

10:48.943 --> 10:53.646
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

10:53.715 --> 10:56.482
In the meantime,

10:56.550 --> 10:59.438
I'm going to need
a provisional chief of staff.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.254
I'd like that to be you.

11:03.825 --> 11:05.480
Um...

11:05.600 --> 11:06.245
<i>Madam President?</i>

11:06.365 --> 11:07.043
Yes?

11:07.163 --> 11:09.863
Tim Woods is here to see you.
Just give me a minute,

11:09.931 --> 11:11.064
please, and then
send him in.

11:12.666 --> 11:15.202
Livy, I need someone
I can trust.

11:15.269 --> 11:18.205
Especially after everything
that's happened today.

11:18.272 --> 11:21.942
You're not going to say "no"
to your mother, are you?

11:24.511 --> 11:26.546
Of course not.

11:26.614 --> 11:28.548
Good.

11:29.751 --> 11:31.952
Madam President,
I have Larry Moss

11:32.019 --> 11:33.620
at FBI calling for you.

11:33.687 --> 11:34.755
What's this about?

11:34.822 --> 11:36.223
I don't know the specifics,

11:36.290 --> 11:38.308
but he says it involves
an imminent homeland threat.

11:39.526 --> 11:40.761
Put him through.

11:42.363 --> 11:43.463
It's all right, Tim.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.599
I've made Olivia
Acting Chief of Staff.

11:48.535 --> 11:50.436
Agent Moss,
you're on with the president.

11:50.504 --> 11:53.106
Madam President, we have
a situation developing.

11:53.174 --> 11:55.541
First of all, you need
to know that Jack Bauer

11:55.609 --> 11:58.278
did not kill Ryan Burnett
nor Senator Blaine Mayer.

11:58.345 --> 11:59.479
He was framed
for their murders.

11:59.546 --> 12:00.613
I knew it.

12:00.681 --> 12:02.715
Who framed him?
Our operational theory

12:02.784 --> 12:04.918
is that he was set up
by Starkwood.

12:04.986 --> 12:07.420
I don't understand.
Why would Starkwood frame Jack?

12:07.488 --> 12:10.090
To cover up the fact that
they helped Juma stage

12:10.158 --> 12:11.992
the terrorist attacks today.

12:12.059 --> 12:12.993
What?

12:13.060 --> 12:14.294
Ma'am, we have evidence

12:14.361 --> 12:15.962
that Starkwood provided Juma

12:16.030 --> 12:17.764
with technological
support and intelligence.

12:17.832 --> 12:20.100
And in return, Juma allowed
Starkwood to use Sangala

12:20.168 --> 12:22.335
as a base to operate
without having

12:22.403 --> 12:23.536
to worry about any oversight.

12:23.604 --> 12:25.238
A base for what?

12:25.306 --> 12:27.573
To manufacture
weapons of mass destruction.

12:27.641 --> 12:30.844
Specifically,
biological weapons.

12:41.422 --> 12:43.824
What kind of bioweapons
are you talking about?

12:43.891 --> 12:45.358
We're not sure,
but it could be

12:45.426 --> 12:47.427
some kind of neurological
pathogen.

12:47.494 --> 12:49.637
CDC has obtained a sample
and they're analyzing it now.

12:49.757 --> 12:51.788
Agent Moss, you said there
was an imminent threat.

12:51.908 --> 12:53.715
Yes, a large shipment
of bioweapons

12:53.835 --> 12:55.274
was delivered
to Starkwood.

12:55.394 --> 12:56.926
We believe they're
in possession of them now.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.839
Are you saying these weapons
are on U.S. soil?

12:58.906 --> 13:00.340
We suspect they're
at the Starkwood

13:00.407 --> 13:01.541
headquarters
in Virginia.

13:01.608 --> 13:03.176
You're not suggesting
that Starkwood

13:03.244 --> 13:06.012
intends to use those weapons
to attack this country?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.882
We don't know,
but, given their actions today,

13:08.950 --> 13:10.884
we need to move
on Starkwood immediately.

13:13.955 --> 13:18.124
Madam President?

13:18.192 --> 13:20.626
Assemble the Cabinet
and the Joint Chiefs.

13:20.694 --> 13:22.462
Yes, ma'am.

13:43.077 --> 13:45.715
<i>
Jack was right about Starkwood.</i>

13:45.783 --> 13:48.852
You found evidence that
they've been supporting Juma.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.186
Yeah.

13:50.254 --> 13:52.155
Did you find out why?

13:52.222 --> 13:53.957
I mean, what could Starkwood
possibly get from Juma?

13:54.025 --> 13:56.426
The infrastructure to develop
and test biological weapons.

13:56.493 --> 13:58.061
We think they're
holding them somewhere

13:58.128 --> 13:59.829
on the Starkwood compound.

13:59.897 --> 14:01.330
Okay, where's Jack?

14:02.733 --> 14:05.368
He's on his way over here.

14:06.857 --> 14:09.039
What, Larry?

14:10.808 --> 14:14.644
He managed to secure
the weapons, but then, uh,

14:14.712 --> 14:16.746
Starkwood got them back.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.816
And when that
happened, um...

14:21.986 --> 14:24.921
Jack was exposed.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.089
He may have
been infected.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.857
He's being placed
under quarantine.

14:27.925 --> 14:30.326
Listen, he's on his way here
and we need to find out

14:30.394 --> 14:32.195
everything that he learned
about these weapons.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.297
And I think you should be
the one who debriefs him.

14:37.668 --> 14:41.104
And I owe you
an apology.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.039
I was wrong not to trust you,

14:43.107 --> 14:47.510
and I-I let my prejudice
about Bauer get in the way.

14:47.578 --> 14:50.446
But...

14:50.514 --> 14:53.316
Renee, you should've
kept me in the loop.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.721
You should've
trusted me.

15:01.425 --> 15:03.660
I know.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.062
I should have.

15:13.638 --> 15:15.639
When are we moving
on Starkwood?

15:18.375 --> 15:20.343
Aaron?

15:20.410 --> 15:22.012
I'll check in
with you guys later, okay?

15:22.079 --> 15:24.080
Thank you.

15:25.916 --> 15:27.851
May I speak with
you for a moment?

15:27.918 --> 15:29.185
Of course.
I heard you finished

15:29.253 --> 15:30.987
your debrief and were
on your way out.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.321
Yes, ma'am.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.490
Well, I need you to stay.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.859
Ma'am?

15:35.926 --> 15:38.695
I've been appointed
Acting Chief of Staff.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.930
Secret Service is going
to assign an agent

15:40.998 --> 15:43.166
to handle my
security detail.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.567
I'd like that to be you.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.438
Well, I'm truly flattered,
ma'am,

15:49.506 --> 15:51.374
but as you know,
I'm retired.

15:51.441 --> 15:53.176
I can have you reinstated.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.545
There are plenty
of fine agents

15:55.612 --> 15:57.246
on the roster.
But I don't want them.

15:57.314 --> 15:58.682
I want you.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.686
I can't go into
the details now,

16:02.753 --> 16:05.188
but the threat to this
country isn't over.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.223
We're in the middle
of a crisis,

16:07.291 --> 16:09.225
and I need people
around me I can trust.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.296
I trust you, Aaron.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.865
I can't say that
about a lot of people.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.301
I'm running into a meeting
with the president.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.838
I'll assume your
answer is "yes."

16:30.681 --> 16:33.950
Gentlemen, ladies,
please take your seats.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.689
Now, those of you who
haven't had a chance

16:39.757 --> 16:41.191
to finish your briefing packets,

16:41.258 --> 16:43.159
please keep reading.

16:46.363 --> 16:48.164
As we've all
just learned,

16:48.232 --> 16:50.333
this day is not over.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.803
Our national security is
still being threatened,

16:53.871 --> 16:56.305
and we are here
to consider our options.

16:56.373 --> 16:57.807
Mr. Woods.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.508
Your briefing materials

16:59.576 --> 17:01.611
include FBI intelligence
about a cache

17:01.678 --> 17:04.413
of biological weapons on
Starkwood's main compound

17:04.481 --> 17:05.815
in Northern Virginia.

17:05.883 --> 17:08.550
This is a recent satellite
view of the compound.

17:08.618 --> 17:11.420
Over three square miles,
259 structures--

17:11.488 --> 17:12.454
the weapons
could be hidden

17:12.521 --> 17:13.757
anywhere on
the facility.

17:13.824 --> 17:14.991
<i>What kind of bioweapons</i>

17:15.059 --> 17:16.126
are we talking about?

17:17.962 --> 17:19.762
This is Ben Landry,
he's director of CDC.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.564
He's here to answer any
questions you may have

17:21.632 --> 17:22.766
in regards
to the pathogen. Ben.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.334
I've just received
a preliminary report

17:25.402 --> 17:26.669
from our agents
in the field.

17:26.737 --> 17:29.372
They've identified
the pathogen as a prion variant

17:29.439 --> 17:31.507
indigenous to the East Congo.

17:31.575 --> 17:34.077
It's a form
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

17:34.145 --> 17:36.012
It attacks the brain
and the nervous system,

17:36.080 --> 17:38.281
causes dementia,
physical deterioration,

17:38.348 --> 17:39.949
ultimately death.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.918
Standard CJD kills
within several months,

17:41.986 --> 17:44.254
but this strain
kills more quickly.

17:44.321 --> 17:45.554
How long?

17:45.622 --> 17:46.923
A day, maybe two.

17:46.991 --> 17:48.491
There's no treatment
for this disease.

17:48.558 --> 17:49.959
There's no cure.
If dispersed

17:50.027 --> 17:51.127
over a populated area,

17:51.195 --> 17:52.595
the results would be
catastrophic.

17:52.663 --> 17:54.898
But it goes
without saying

17:54.965 --> 17:57.533
we cannot allow
a private military force,

17:57.601 --> 18:00.636
these killers, to possess
weapons of mass destruction.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.538
We need to find these weapons,

18:02.606 --> 18:05.041
and arrest those bastards
in Starkwood

18:05.109 --> 18:07.343
who are responsible
for bringing them here.

18:08.846 --> 18:10.079
Madam President.

18:12.283 --> 18:15.451
Given the size of the compound,
it would take

18:15.519 --> 18:17.653
a considerable force
to locate these weapons.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.589
Not to mention the fact
that there are 1,500

18:20.657 --> 18:23.293
highly-trained mercenaries
on that base.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.494
God forbid
they decide to resist.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.464
We could have a small war
in our own backyard.

18:29.381 --> 18:31.600
I share those concerns,
Madam President.

18:31.668 --> 18:33.736
We also have to consider
the possibility

18:33.804 --> 18:35.972
that Starkwood might use
these biological weapons

18:36.040 --> 18:37.340
against our own forces.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.975
What about an air strike?

18:40.610 --> 18:43.313
A facility that large would
require multiple bombing runs.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.048
We'd be looking
at massive casualties

18:45.115 --> 18:46.482
on the Starkwood base,

18:46.550 --> 18:48.417
with no guarantee
of destroying the bioweapons.

18:48.485 --> 18:49.485
For all we know,

18:49.553 --> 18:50.519
they've been
buried underground

18:50.587 --> 18:51.821
or in fortified facilities.

18:51.889 --> 18:54.123
There's also a risk that
hitting these weapons

18:54.191 --> 18:55.725
with insufficient force
could release the bio-agent

18:55.792 --> 18:56.960
into the atmosphere.

18:57.027 --> 18:58.928
<i>We can't just
ignore the law here.</i>

18:58.996 --> 19:01.904
All these scenarios
would be in violation

19:02.024 --> 19:03.699
of the Posse
Comitatus Act.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.535
I mean, we can't deploy
military personnel

19:06.603 --> 19:08.704
in a law enforcement
capacity.

19:08.772 --> 19:12.108
Not without
congressional approval.

19:12.176 --> 19:13.309
What I'm hearing

19:13.377 --> 19:16.980
is that there are
no good options.

19:17.047 --> 19:19.148
I don't accept that.

19:20.184 --> 19:21.284
Until we find

19:21.352 --> 19:23.152
a way to contain this threat,

19:23.220 --> 19:26.389
we are risking another attack
on this country.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.458
And that is an option
I won't consider.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.731
Mr. Hodges
wants to know

19:35.799 --> 19:38.268
if you've given
any thought to his offer.

19:41.738 --> 19:44.874
Why this loyalty to a government
that screwed you over?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.676
I don't get it.

19:47.744 --> 19:48.978
Just tell us

19:49.046 --> 19:51.281
what the FBI knows
and you can walk.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.420
For the record,

19:57.487 --> 19:59.422
I bet Mr. Hodges a pair
of Redskins tickets

19:59.489 --> 20:01.958
you wouldn't talk.

20:06.196 --> 20:07.430
Looks like I'm going
to be sitting

20:07.497 --> 20:09.899
on the 50 yard line.

20:13.103 --> 20:15.071
Hey.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.841
Hey, what
the hell's going on?

20:21.778 --> 20:23.346
I need your help.

20:23.414 --> 20:25.114
My help?

20:25.182 --> 20:27.250
We need to stop this.
It's gone too far.

20:27.318 --> 20:30.453
Look, I'm not going anywhere

20:30.520 --> 20:32.088
until you tell me
why you're doing this.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.463
I'm not spending
the rest of my life

20:40.530 --> 20:42.932
in prison because Jonas Hodges
has lost his mind.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.600
You know where the weapons are?

20:44.668 --> 20:45.935
Yes.

20:46.003 --> 20:47.770
Then you better
tell me right now.

20:47.838 --> 20:49.605
I want immunity.

20:49.673 --> 20:51.874
Look, I can't promise you
anything.

20:51.942 --> 20:54.143
We can call the FBI
and negotiate a deal,

20:54.211 --> 20:56.112
immunity in exchange
for your help

20:56.180 --> 20:58.281
in recovering the weapons,
that's the best I can do.

21:00.317 --> 21:02.651
I can set up a secure
landline in my office.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.053
Good, let's go.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.399
We're pulling up to FBI.

21:16.467 --> 21:18.501
We have to put you
in an isolation suit

21:18.568 --> 21:20.669
to transfer you to
the quarantine area.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.338
I understand.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.672
How are you feeling?

21:25.642 --> 21:27.143
No different.

21:28.645 --> 21:30.480
We have the results
of Mr. Bauer's blood work.

21:30.547 --> 21:31.881
Thank you.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.324
Open it.

21:59.176 --> 22:00.076
Thank you.

22:18.315 --> 22:19.282
Excuse me.

22:19.350 --> 22:20.516
Larry wanted me
to tell you,

22:20.584 --> 22:22.151
that CDC arrived
with Jack Bauer.

22:22.219 --> 22:23.919
I'll meet them down
in quarantine.
He's not in quarantine.

22:23.988 --> 22:26.622
I don't understand.

22:26.690 --> 22:27.957
That's all I know.

22:28.025 --> 22:29.625
They just cleared security.
He's on his way up.

22:39.007 --> 22:41.404
Jack, are you okay?

22:41.472 --> 22:43.406
My blood work came
back positive.

22:43.474 --> 22:44.740
I'm infected.

22:44.808 --> 22:47.010
<i>Mr. Bauer, there's a room
for you to change in.</i>

22:47.077 --> 22:49.045
Thank you.

22:49.113 --> 22:51.647
It's fine.

22:53.683 --> 22:56.285
But he's not in quarantine.

22:56.353 --> 22:58.454
We've learned the disease
isn't contagious.

22:58.522 --> 23:00.356
It was engineered that way
to prevent blowback

23:00.424 --> 23:01.857
on the people deploying it.
Okay,

23:01.925 --> 23:02.958
but there has to be something

23:03.027 --> 23:04.827
that you can do
to help him.

23:04.895 --> 23:06.496
There's no cure.

23:06.563 --> 23:07.630
But he's patient zero.

23:07.697 --> 23:08.864
Whatever we learn
from the pathogen

23:08.932 --> 23:10.433
will come from the tests
we still need to run.

23:12.403 --> 23:15.038
Excuse me.

23:15.105 --> 23:18.207
This is Macer.

23:18.275 --> 23:20.510
He's stable for
the moment.

23:24.148 --> 23:26.149
Yeah?

23:29.853 --> 23:31.987
Jack, um...

23:32.056 --> 23:34.457
I don't know what to say.

23:34.525 --> 23:37.060
Then tell me that Agent Moss
followed up on Starkwood.

23:40.964 --> 23:42.898
Sorry.

23:42.966 --> 23:44.900
Larry debriefed the White House

23:44.968 --> 23:46.469
and we're waiting
on the president

23:46.537 --> 23:48.003
to decide on a course of action.

23:48.072 --> 23:49.472
Good.

23:49.540 --> 23:50.573
Any word on Tony?

23:50.640 --> 23:53.943
Sorry, we don't know
anything yet.

23:55.812 --> 23:57.980
I need to debrief you

23:58.048 --> 24:00.015
on the canisters that you saw.

24:00.084 --> 24:02.017
You okay with that?

24:02.086 --> 24:03.752
Yeah.

24:07.124 --> 24:08.924
I read the statement

24:08.992 --> 24:11.427
from the Port
Authority cop.

24:11.495 --> 24:13.563
He said that
you risked the mission

24:13.630 --> 24:15.631
to save his life.

24:17.301 --> 24:19.935
You did the right thing.

24:20.971 --> 24:23.206
Thanks.

25:05.382 --> 25:07.583
Uh, it's the lab.

25:08.652 --> 25:10.386
It's probably
Hodges.

25:10.454 --> 25:11.887
We should talk to him.

25:11.955 --> 25:13.956
Put it on speaker.

25:16.126 --> 25:18.093
Seaton.

25:18.162 --> 25:19.795
Where the hell have you been?

25:19.863 --> 25:20.829
I've been trying

25:20.897 --> 25:21.830
to reach you.

25:21.898 --> 25:24.167
I was, uh, checking
on Almeida.

25:24.234 --> 25:26.769
Did Stokes get him to talk?

25:26.836 --> 25:28.003
He's still working
on that, sir.

25:28.071 --> 25:30.005
I told him to put
Almeida down

25:30.073 --> 25:31.307
if he didn't
start talking.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.842
I think we should give him
a few more minutes, sir.

25:33.910 --> 25:36.187
We're busting our asses to
get these weapons ready

25:36.307 --> 25:38.013
before the government
makes their move,

25:38.081 --> 25:40.983
I want all hands on deck.

25:41.051 --> 25:42.351
We'll be there soon, sir.

25:42.419 --> 25:44.320
See that you are, Greg.

25:46.089 --> 25:47.723
Call FBI.

25:47.791 --> 25:50.059
I need to set up
the secure landline.

25:50.126 --> 25:51.694
Make sure nobody's listening.

25:51.761 --> 25:53.696
All right, well, do it.

25:55.144 --> 25:57.733
I never thought Jonas
would take it this far.

25:57.801 --> 25:59.902
I mean, the man's
a patriot.

25:59.969 --> 26:02.205
He founded Starkwood to protect

26:02.272 --> 26:03.539
this country.

26:03.607 --> 26:05.548
Yeah, well,
why is he attacking it?

26:05.668 --> 26:06.933
It's complicated.

26:07.617 --> 26:10.713
I don't understand
it myself.

26:10.780 --> 26:13.115
I should've done more
to stop this.

26:15.052 --> 26:15.476
I should've

26:15.596 --> 26:17.086
called FBI months ago.

26:17.153 --> 26:19.555
Well, you're doing
the right thing now.

26:19.623 --> 26:22.057
I've pulled together everything
we have on Starkwood.

26:22.125 --> 26:24.393
Structural specs,
aerial maps,

26:24.461 --> 26:25.961
topography,
company roster,

26:26.029 --> 26:27.129
the whole works.
All right.

26:27.197 --> 26:29.332
Upload it onto
the interagency servers.

26:29.399 --> 26:31.467
Let's get everybody
on the same page.

26:33.036 --> 26:34.537
That's good
work, Janis.

26:34.605 --> 26:35.871
Renee...

26:38.709 --> 26:40.309
I heard about Jack.

26:40.377 --> 26:41.844
I'm sorry.

26:41.911 --> 26:43.879
I'm still debriefing him
but I brought a full

26:43.947 --> 26:45.481
description of
the canisters.

26:45.549 --> 26:47.350
All right.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.594
All right, get this out
to the field agents.

26:50.219 --> 26:51.354
How's he doing?

26:51.421 --> 26:54.189
Hard to tell.

26:56.092 --> 26:58.026
Larry, so many people
have died today.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.428
We cannot let their deaths be

26:59.496 --> 27:00.633
for nothing.
We won't.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.898
Larry.
I've got Tony Almeida

27:02.966 --> 27:04.734
on the phone.
Almeida?

27:04.801 --> 27:06.602
He says he's calling
from inside Starkwood.

27:06.670 --> 27:09.142
Put him through.

27:09.262 --> 27:10.906
Go ahead, Tony.

27:10.974 --> 27:12.007
Who am I talking to?

27:12.075 --> 27:13.876
It's Larry Moss.
What's going on?

27:13.943 --> 27:15.311
I'm on the Starkwood compound.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.647
I was being held by a man
named Jonas Hodges,

27:17.714 --> 27:19.509
but I was released
by one of his executives.

27:19.629 --> 27:21.717
A man named Greg Seaton.

27:21.785 --> 27:23.218
Now he wants
to cut a deal.

27:23.287 --> 27:24.553
He wants immunity.

27:24.621 --> 27:26.175
What's he offering
in return?

27:26.295 --> 27:28.190
He knows where the weapons
are being held.

27:29.959 --> 27:32.328
All right, Tony, I got to run
this by the president.

27:32.396 --> 27:33.996
Wait, Larry.

27:34.063 --> 27:35.598
Do you know
what happened to Jack?

27:36.700 --> 27:38.267
He's here.

27:38.335 --> 27:40.269
He's in medical.

27:40.337 --> 27:41.837
Was he hit?
No.

27:41.905 --> 27:43.739
One of the canisters
was breached.

27:43.807 --> 27:45.808
He's been infected.

27:47.003 --> 27:49.178
Tony, I got to call
the White House. Stand by.

27:49.245 --> 27:50.613
Janis, set up a secure
connection in the conference

27:50.681 --> 27:52.515
room with Almeida and the White
House for this signature.

27:52.582 --> 27:54.283
And get me the president
on the phone.

28:18.941 --> 28:20.875
<i>Footage recovered
from Sangala.</i>

28:20.943 --> 28:22.677
It was smuggled out
of the remains

28:22.745 --> 28:26.648
of a biological weapons lab
about 45 minutes ago.

28:26.715 --> 28:30.318
It's a confirmation that
Juma was experimenting

28:30.385 --> 28:33.054
with biological weapons

28:33.121 --> 28:35.089
on the local
population.

28:35.157 --> 28:38.023
These poor people
were suffering

28:38.143 --> 28:41.496
from the effects of the
weaponized prion variant.

28:41.564 --> 28:44.666
And that's what
we allowed Starkwood

28:44.733 --> 28:46.701
to bring into this country.

28:46.769 --> 28:48.736
We didn't allow this.

28:48.804 --> 28:51.573
Starkwood is a monster
we created, Olivia.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.075
We have been feeding it
for years.

28:54.142 --> 28:56.010
We gave them military contracts.

28:56.078 --> 28:58.012
We relied
on their paid mercenaries

28:58.080 --> 28:59.514
instead of our own soldiers,

28:59.582 --> 29:02.116
outsourced intelligence
gathering operations.

29:02.184 --> 29:03.952
My God, we even passed a law

29:04.019 --> 29:05.620
so that they could build
a military base

29:05.688 --> 29:07.589
13 miles
from the nation's capitol.

29:07.656 --> 29:09.591
You fought against all that.

29:09.658 --> 29:11.392
You've been trying
to limit Starkwood's power

29:11.460 --> 29:12.855
ever since you took office.

29:12.975 --> 29:15.597
I didn't do enough...

29:15.664 --> 29:17.632
fast enough.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.902
And now it may be too late.

29:20.970 --> 29:22.937
<i>Madam President,
Tim Woods</i>

29:23.005 --> 29:24.606
and Admiral Smith
are here to see you.

29:24.673 --> 29:26.674
Send them in.

29:29.712 --> 29:31.646
Madam President, Larry Moss
at FBI is calling in.

29:31.714 --> 29:32.680
He says it's urgent.

29:32.748 --> 29:34.148
Put him through.

29:34.216 --> 29:36.217
Agent Moss,
the president's here. Go ahead.

29:36.284 --> 29:37.685
Madam President,
we've been contacted

29:37.753 --> 29:39.721
by someone inside
Starkwood.

29:39.788 --> 29:41.723
Ma'am, it's Tony Almeida.

29:41.790 --> 29:43.391
Almeida?

29:43.458 --> 29:45.493
He's been working with Jack
Bauer to recover these weapons.

29:45.561 --> 29:47.529
He was taken captive
but then released

29:47.596 --> 29:49.130
by someone on the inside.

29:49.197 --> 29:50.832
His name is Greg Seaton.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.134
He's part of Jonas
Hodges' inner circle.

29:53.201 --> 29:54.802
Ma'am, he says
he's willing to tell us

29:54.870 --> 29:57.171
where the weapons are
in exchange for immunity.

29:57.239 --> 29:59.173
Now, I've already started
mobilizing

29:59.241 --> 30:00.742
for a targeted raid.

30:00.809 --> 30:02.076
We can catch 'em by surprise

30:02.144 --> 30:03.110
and lock down
these weapons.

30:03.178 --> 30:04.478
But I'm going to
need you to sign

30:04.547 --> 30:05.747
an immunity agreement
for this man.

30:05.814 --> 30:06.814
How confident

30:06.882 --> 30:08.315
are you of Seaton's intel?

30:08.383 --> 30:09.918
We believe it's genuine, ma'am.

30:10.786 --> 30:11.786
Madam President,

30:11.854 --> 30:13.320
we may not get a chance
like this again.

30:13.388 --> 30:15.222
Admiral Smith?

30:15.290 --> 30:16.558
I concur,

30:16.625 --> 30:18.359
but I would suggest
we supplement the FBI

30:18.427 --> 30:19.727
with a SEAL squad.

30:19.795 --> 30:21.162
They're ready to move
on my order.

30:21.229 --> 30:22.702
The attorney general
will raise hell

30:22.822 --> 30:24.732
about us involving the military
in this operation.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.734
We'll deal with him later.

30:26.802 --> 30:28.235
Agent Moss, you have

30:28.303 --> 30:31.238
my direct authorization
to move on Starkwood.

30:31.306 --> 30:33.240
How soon can you be ready?

30:33.308 --> 30:35.076
We've already drafted
an executive pardon,

30:35.143 --> 30:36.878
and set it up via WebEx.

30:36.946 --> 30:39.847
You'll be able to give a
secure digital signature
and we're good to go.

30:39.915 --> 30:42.349
We have the document set up
at your assistant's computer.

30:51.393 --> 30:53.360
Agent Moss,

30:53.428 --> 30:54.696
the president
is prepared to sign.

30:54.763 --> 30:56.097
Go ahead, ma'am.

31:01.136 --> 31:03.638
All right,
it's done.

31:03.706 --> 31:05.039
Tony, did you get
the signature?

31:05.107 --> 31:06.074
Yeah, we're good.

31:06.141 --> 31:08.175
When can you be
at Starkwood?

31:08.243 --> 31:10.011
We can be there
in ten minutes.

31:10.079 --> 31:11.813
Agent Moss, thank you.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.114
And good luck.

31:13.181 --> 31:14.148
Thank you, ma'am.

31:14.216 --> 31:16.684
Let's go.

31:16.752 --> 31:18.753
Madam President, we may have
just caught a lucky break.

31:18.821 --> 31:20.421
Until this plays out,

31:20.489 --> 31:23.357
I want everyone to keep looking
for other options.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.567
All right, Mr. Seaton.

31:33.636 --> 31:35.569
Go ahead.

31:35.638 --> 31:37.605
The weapons are
in a warehouse

31:37.673 --> 31:40.274
on the northeast quadrant
of the compound.

31:40.342 --> 31:43.444
32, 44.23 north...

31:43.512 --> 31:46.380
117, 10.42 west.

31:47.716 --> 31:50.284
Mr. Seaton, it would help
to have someone on the ground

31:50.352 --> 31:51.418
doing recon.

31:51.486 --> 31:53.121
Can you get Tony
to that warehouse?

31:53.188 --> 31:54.255
I think so.

31:54.322 --> 31:55.823
See if you can get ahold
of a hand radio.

31:55.891 --> 31:56.858
We'll be on 480 kilohertz.

31:56.925 --> 31:58.526
All right, we'll be there.

31:58.593 --> 32:01.295
If we land here, we'll be within
50 yards of the warehouse.

32:01.363 --> 32:02.329
Yeah, support
teams here

32:02.397 --> 32:03.330
and here.
Shore us up.

32:03.398 --> 32:05.332
Coordinate
with the navy.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.035
Get moving.
I'll meet you upstairs.

32:07.102 --> 32:08.317
Let's move!

32:11.273 --> 32:12.874
You're mobilizing.
What's going on?

32:12.941 --> 32:14.909
We got a call
from Tony.

32:14.977 --> 32:16.978
He's working with an informant
inside Starkwood.

32:17.046 --> 32:18.379
We got a location
on the weapon,

32:18.446 --> 32:19.547
we're getting ready
to stage

32:19.614 --> 32:21.315
a raid on the
compound.
I want to go.

32:21.383 --> 32:23.785
I can understand why,
but I'm sorry.

32:23.852 --> 32:25.319
I can't allow it.
Larry, I can help
you with this.

32:25.387 --> 32:26.487
I'm the only one who's
seen the canisters,

32:26.555 --> 32:28.355
I know exactly what
we're looking for.

32:28.423 --> 32:29.390
I read your debrief.

32:29.457 --> 32:31.726
You gave us all the
details we need.

32:31.794 --> 32:34.580
Larry, please, I've earned this.

32:36.198 --> 32:37.965
Jack, I know

32:38.033 --> 32:39.801
what you've done today,

32:39.868 --> 32:41.169
the sacrifice you've made.

32:41.236 --> 32:43.571
Uh, under any
other circumstances,

32:43.638 --> 32:46.040
I'd want you out there
with us, but you're sick,

32:46.108 --> 32:47.308
and we have no idea

32:47.375 --> 32:49.077
when you're going to
start showing symptoms.

32:49.144 --> 32:50.745
I cannot risk
that happening

32:50.813 --> 32:52.046
out in the field.

32:52.114 --> 32:54.082
I need my best men
for this operation.

32:56.484 --> 32:58.186
I hope you can understand that.

33:02.490 --> 33:04.092
You're right.

33:05.961 --> 33:07.962
You're right.

33:10.332 --> 33:12.499
Yeah.

33:12.567 --> 33:15.502
I always knew eventually
we'd agree on something.

33:18.006 --> 33:20.141
I'm so sorry, Jack.

33:56.947 --> 33:59.048
Mr. Seaton?
Murphy,
I need

33:59.116 --> 34:00.880
to check the personnel that...

34:30.480 --> 34:32.414
That's it.

34:33.373 --> 34:36.219
The weapons are
inside there.

34:36.286 --> 34:38.320
<i>How many men inside?</i>

34:38.388 --> 34:41.224
Hodges, munitions team,
security.

34:41.291 --> 34:43.592
I'm guessing a
dozen or more.

34:47.164 --> 34:49.632
Wolves are at the door, Tommy.

34:49.699 --> 34:51.634
How much longer?

34:51.701 --> 34:53.735
We're still an hour away
from being armed, sir.

34:53.804 --> 34:56.139
We just intercepted
a government transmission.

34:56.206 --> 34:58.440
FBI is on the way.

34:58.508 --> 35:01.844
Sir, we haven't even run
the sequence checks yet.

35:01.912 --> 35:03.579
Let's do it!

35:03.647 --> 35:06.082
Oh, damn it.

35:11.488 --> 35:12.955
What's our ETA?

35:13.023 --> 35:15.124
Two minutes, sir.

35:15.192 --> 35:16.826
Tony, it's Larry Moss.

35:16.894 --> 35:18.227
Are you in position?

35:18.295 --> 35:19.528
<i>Affirmative.</i>

35:19.596 --> 35:21.998
We're about 50 yards
north of the warehouse.

35:22.065 --> 35:23.833
<i>What can you tell me?</i>

35:23.901 --> 35:26.002
Got two entrances,
north and south.

35:26.069 --> 35:27.804
Heavy steel doors.

35:27.871 --> 35:30.206
Two guards armed
with automatic weapons.

35:30.274 --> 35:32.541
Seaton says there's probably
about a dozen inside.

35:32.609 --> 35:34.710
We have to assume
they're armed, as well.

35:34.778 --> 35:36.212
All right.
We're almost there.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.114
I'm gonna need your eyes
on the ground in case

35:38.182 --> 35:39.315
there's any resistance.

35:39.382 --> 35:40.516
Copy that.

35:40.583 --> 35:41.818
Aerial One to home base.

35:41.885 --> 35:43.886
Target has been confirmed.
We are go

35:43.954 --> 35:46.655
for Tac plan Alpha.
Copy that, Aerial One.

35:46.723 --> 35:48.691
All feeds are live.
We're monitoring your approach.

35:53.263 --> 35:55.298
Sir, we're being signaled
by Starkwood's air tower.

35:55.365 --> 35:56.699
Let me talk to them.

35:58.601 --> 35:59.335
You're on.

35:59.402 --> 36:00.569
This is Special Agent

36:00.637 --> 36:02.038
Larry Moss from FBI.

36:02.105 --> 36:03.906
We have an executive order

36:03.974 --> 36:05.341
from the president
of the United States

36:05.408 --> 36:07.176
to search one of your buildings.

36:07.244 --> 36:09.478
FBI? I'll need
to get authorization

36:09.546 --> 36:10.646
from my superior.

36:10.714 --> 36:11.814
We have sent you

36:11.882 --> 36:13.649
a digital copy
of the executive order.

36:13.717 --> 36:14.984
Check your wireless frequency.

36:15.052 --> 36:16.152
That is all

36:16.220 --> 36:18.054
the authorization
you will need.

36:18.121 --> 36:20.756
Make no attempt to interfere,
or you will be arrested.

36:20.858 --> 36:22.124
Do you understand?

36:23.160 --> 36:25.261
Do you understand?

36:25.329 --> 36:26.628
Understood, FBI.

36:26.696 --> 36:29.065
Take us in.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.301
Aerial One to home base.

36:32.369 --> 36:33.535
We're good to go.

36:33.603 --> 36:34.703
Copy that, Aerial One.

36:34.771 --> 36:35.972
Looks like
you have got a clean approach.

36:36.039 --> 36:37.206
No hostiles in sight.

37:42.539 --> 37:43.505
<i>You all right?</i>

37:43.573 --> 37:44.873
We have a medic.

37:44.942 --> 37:46.275
I'm fine.

37:46.343 --> 37:49.412
Seaton, I need you
to stay behind us.

37:49.479 --> 37:51.480
Let's go.

38:13.536 --> 38:14.670
Stand down!

38:15.653 --> 38:17.506
You were told to stand down!

38:17.574 --> 38:20.609
Lower your weapons
and get on the ground now!

38:21.711 --> 38:23.468
Lock them down!

38:30.954 --> 38:33.055
It's locked, sir.

38:33.123 --> 38:34.390
Blow it.

38:40.178 --> 38:41.197
Blasting!

38:41.264 --> 38:44.333
Three. Two. One!

38:46.269 --> 38:48.070
Go. Go!

39:03.620 --> 39:04.753
Where are the weapons?

39:04.821 --> 39:06.571
I don't know.

39:06.691 --> 39:08.324
What do you mean,
you don't know?

39:08.392 --> 39:09.925
Almeida was threatening
to kill me.

39:09.993 --> 39:11.827
I told him
what he wanted to hear.

39:11.895 --> 39:13.729
You lying son of a
bitch! You came to me!

39:13.796 --> 39:15.597
Now, where are
the weapons?!

39:15.717 --> 39:18.600
Where are the damn weapons?!
Tell him to take
his hands off of me.

39:18.668 --> 39:21.504
Tony? Tony! I need you
to stand down now!

39:21.571 --> 39:23.172
You're not getting away
with this.

39:23.240 --> 39:24.507
Secure him!

39:26.743 --> 39:28.177
He's lying, Larry.

39:29.702 --> 39:31.914
He played me.

39:31.981 --> 39:33.682
Yeah, I know.
It looks that way.

39:46.196 --> 39:48.830
Well, what do you know?

39:48.898 --> 39:51.133
Little old Seaton
bought us some time.

39:51.201 --> 39:55.204
They're on the other
side of the compound.

39:55.272 --> 39:58.441
We just have
to keep them there.

40:24.634 --> 40:26.868
There's nothing here, sir.

40:29.973 --> 40:31.407
Renee, the warehouse is empty.

40:31.475 --> 40:32.975
Tony's informant

40:33.042 --> 40:34.076
sent us to the wrong location.

40:34.144 --> 40:36.078
This whole thing
was a diversion.

40:36.146 --> 40:38.180
They couldn't have
gotten them out that fast.

40:38.248 --> 40:39.715
The weapons are
there somewhere.

40:39.782 --> 40:41.317
Larry, the weapons have to be

40:41.384 --> 40:42.485
inside of Starkwood.

40:42.552 --> 40:43.885
Tell them to
keep looking.

40:43.953 --> 40:45.988
Stand by.

40:48.077 --> 40:50.326
All right, everyone
outside now.

41:06.109 --> 41:08.043
All right, listen up.

41:08.111 --> 41:09.612
We're going
to do a point-by-point

41:09.679 --> 41:11.947
search of this entire compound.

41:12.015 --> 41:13.882
Good.

41:13.950 --> 41:15.784
<i>I want four teams sweeping</i>

41:15.852 --> 41:17.853
every structure
on this property.

41:25.262 --> 41:26.228
Jack.

41:28.498 --> 41:29.431
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

41:30.467 --> 41:32.168
Hold your fire.

41:36.139 --> 41:37.506
Hold your fire.

41:37.574 --> 41:39.141
Stay in position.

41:41.411 --> 41:42.944
Tell Larry to have
his men stand down.

41:43.012 --> 41:45.447
Are you kidding me? They just
drew on federal forces.

41:45.515 --> 41:46.748
If you don't want to lose
your men, you'll get them

41:46.816 --> 41:47.949
to stand down now. Now!

41:50.053 --> 41:52.054
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

41:58.061 --> 41:59.127
That's far enough.

42:04.301 --> 42:07.002
We cooperated
with your demand

42:07.070 --> 42:08.937
to search this building.

42:09.005 --> 42:10.105
Now, we're asking you to leave.

42:10.173 --> 42:11.273
<i>There are biological</i>

42:11.341 --> 42:12.441
weapons on this facility.

42:12.509 --> 42:14.109
We're not going anywhere
without them.

42:14.177 --> 42:15.648
Now, tell your men
to stand down.

42:15.768 --> 42:17.479
Those charges are absurd,

42:17.547 --> 42:19.981
and we're not going to
let you keep searching.

42:20.049 --> 42:21.617
You're on private property,

42:21.685 --> 42:23.999
and we're prepared
to defend it if necessary.

42:24.119 --> 42:26.455
You are threatening
federal agents.

42:26.523 --> 42:28.457
Stand down! Now!

42:28.525 --> 42:29.725
We're protecting our rights

42:29.792 --> 42:31.293
against a hostile government
that's using

42:31.361 --> 42:34.029
false charges to
try to shut us down.

42:34.097 --> 42:35.931
Now, we don't want
any bloodshed.

42:38.201 --> 42:41.803
But if you try
to advance any farther,

42:41.871 --> 42:44.340
you will be fired upon.
