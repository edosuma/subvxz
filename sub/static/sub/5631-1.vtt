WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.202
.

00:01.435 --> 00:01.669
- Hello.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.339
- Yates chooses his victims
at random.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.408
Nadia Decotis was tortured
and killed.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.511
Yates transported her
to his burial ground.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.413
- How many others?
- Seven so far.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.415
- No forensics, nothing
to tie him to any of them?

00:14.448 --> 00:16.917
- Green nail polish
was applied to the victims.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.220
He either burned the bodies,
or he buried them.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.922
- He gets off on torture,
even in court.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.926
See what we saw?
- I just hope the jury saw it.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.496
- On the charge of murder
in the first degree,

00:28.529 --> 00:32.766
we find the defendant
Gregory Yates guilty.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.575
male announcer:
In the criminal justice system,

00:41.609 --> 00:45.079
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.415
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:47.448 --> 00:49.417
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:49.450 --> 00:50.918
are members of an elite squad

00:50.951 --> 00:52.920
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.389
These are their stories.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.128
[water sloshes]

01:18.812 --> 01:21.149
- What, was she dismembered,
or did she come apart in water?

01:21.149 --> 01:22.616
- No obvious tears,
but there are

01:22.650 --> 01:24.185
cutting marks
in the bones and tendons.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.720
- Another body here
at Yates' burial ground.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.689
- Yeah, some skinny-dipping
teenagers ditching class

01:28.722 --> 01:29.990
kicked up the vic.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.359
Local precinct gave us
the heads-up,

01:31.392 --> 01:32.660
thought it might be one
we missed.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.295
- How?
We covered the whole island.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.529
- And Yates buried his bodies.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.165
This one
we found floating in the water.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.399
- It just happens to coincide

01:38.432 --> 01:39.633
with when and where Yates
dumped Nadia?

01:39.667 --> 01:40.801
Rollins.
- Okay.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.636
What, he buried Nadia,
goes back out to Queens,

01:42.670 --> 01:45.373
assaults two flight attendants,
has lunch with his fiancée,

01:45.406 --> 01:47.175
and finds time
for a fourth assault?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.643
Come on.
- The man was on a spree.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.245
- For brunettes.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.980
She's a redhead.
It's not his type.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.548
- We got nine dead bodies

01:54.582 --> 01:56.884
found here,
all by the same killer.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.919
- And now we got the tenth.
Occam's razor.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.354
- Guys, listen,
we have two options.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.924
One is bad.
The other one is worse.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.193
Either we missed one,

02:05.193 --> 02:08.696
or Yates has a copycat.

02:10.097 --> 02:14.001
- The victim is
a Caucasian female, late 20s,

02:14.034 --> 02:17.638
probable cause of death--
fractured skull.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.409
Right arm severed surgically
at the shoulder.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.944
- Dr. Rudnick,
are we interrupting?

02:23.977 --> 02:27.080
- No, not at all. Just notating
my initial findings.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.217
Found in Pelham Bay,

02:29.217 --> 02:31.919
so either she floated up
as the water warmed,

02:31.952 --> 02:34.488
or CSU missed her in April?

02:34.522 --> 02:36.424
- So you think Yates did this?

02:36.457 --> 02:39.527
- I can't say definitively,

02:39.560 --> 02:43.697
but there are findings
consistent with Yates' MO,

02:43.731 --> 02:45.233
as well as evidence
of injury,

02:45.233 --> 02:47.668
both vaginal and anal,
consistent with rape.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.870
- Even after this long
in the water?

02:49.903 --> 02:52.306
- There's no question
the skull was fractured

02:52.340 --> 02:54.942
just like those of the two
flight attendants and Nadia.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.810
- Yeah, but this body
was also dismembered.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.779
That's not part of Yates' MO.
- Correct.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.714
However, I can tell you the cuts
were made by someone

03:00.748 --> 03:02.250
with surgical training.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.051
And another
interesting detail--

03:04.084 --> 03:06.954
microscopic traces
of green nail polish

03:06.987 --> 03:08.956
under two fingernails.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.359
- Another coincidence, Rollins?
- It's public record.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.726
- If you say so.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.073
- [sighing]
Ooh.

03:26.106 --> 03:30.478
That poor, poor girl--
raped, tortured.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.980
- And her skull
was fractured.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.649
- You think I'm responsible.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.285
I understand.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.152
It is the logical assumption.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.054
We had a saying
in medical school--

03:41.088 --> 03:45.559
if you hear hoofbeats,
think horses, not zebras.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.428
- The ME found traces

03:47.461 --> 03:51.131
of green polish
on her fingernails.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.500
- Really?

03:55.135 --> 03:57.305
Now, that is fascinating.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.376
Someone committed
this horrific crime,

04:02.410 --> 04:04.011
and then he went
out of his way

04:04.044 --> 04:06.480
to piggyback it onto crimes
I've been accused of.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.550
- That was
my initial response.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.784
And the red hair...

04:10.818 --> 04:15.323
- [scoffs]
Gingers are anathema to me.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.624
I prefer brunettes.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.091
No offense.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.693
It's a long story.

04:19.727 --> 04:22.530
And the body dismembered--

04:22.563 --> 04:24.932
it's so unnecessary.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.567
It's so barbaric.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.337
- Well, any ideas
why somebody would have done it?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.104
- Well, I don't know.

04:31.138 --> 04:35.443
Maybe the killer likes the act
of cutting into bone and flesh.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.346
Do you mind if I...

04:38.346 --> 04:39.747
have another look?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.849
- Go right ahead.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.120
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.766
I'm really sorry.
You...

04:58.799 --> 05:01.469
you have your work
cut out for you.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.680
- I appreciate
your help, Doctor.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.621
- Thoughts are occurring.

05:20.654 --> 05:25.393
If I can, uh, stew on them
for a couple of days...

05:25.426 --> 05:27.895
I might have something
for you.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.400
[door buzzes, unlocks]

05:36.236 --> 05:38.238
[door creaks, closes]

05:40.808 --> 05:43.777
[dramatic music]

06:27.488 --> 06:27.588
.

06:28.288 --> 06:28.989
- Yates told you
that it wasn't him?

06:29.523 --> 06:30.624
- Yeah.

06:30.658 --> 06:31.925
- I bet he still says
that Nadia wasn't him.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.462
- No, the timeline is too tight.
This girl was a redhead.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.764
Okay, he's never dismembered
a body before this.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.131
- We found skulls
last time, Amanda.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.300
- Yeah, but that was skeletal
remains of decomped corpses.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.535
This is different.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.203
You know, his victims
were never prostitutes.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.672
This girl is a Jane Doe.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.774
- Amanda, I don't know
what you're doing,

06:46.807 --> 06:47.908
but this isn't police work.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.276
- I am cultivating a source.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.545
Listen, Yates hinted that
he might know who the killer is.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.046
- Hinted, but didn't say.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.582
So what, do you have to go
back there again,

06:54.615 --> 06:55.883
and then he'll tell you?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.317
- He's playing you.
This guy's a psychopath.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.852
- Not to mention, Amanda,

06:58.886 --> 07:00.220
you went up there
without clearing it with me.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.089
I'm not trusting your judgment
right now.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.491
- Okay.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.092
All right,
maybe you guys are right.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.359
So say it is Yates.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.961
Just let me keep
building a rapport.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.630
Then maybe we can finally
get an ID on this girl.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.499
[knock at door]
- Hey, Sarge.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.500
Sorry to interrupt,

07:12.500 --> 07:14.602
but I finally got a hit
from our DNA.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.070
- From CODIS?
- No, military database.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.806
Vic's name
is Brooke Groves, 28.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.508
She was ROTC
at SUNY Plattsburgh.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.510
- Didn't the ME
say she was a working girl?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.311
- Well, yeah, but before that,
she had another life.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.979
Last known address
was in Larchmont.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.114
- I'll go with.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.750
- Actually, Rollins, you
stay here with Fin.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.686
I'll let you know
what we find out.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.993
- There you are.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.895
- Yeah, they spend all this
money renovating the squad room,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.931
and there's still
nothing to eat.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.533
- How you feeling?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.601
- I'm just tired.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.770
I've been taking too many shifts
since Nick left.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.972
- You talk to him?

07:52.005 --> 07:55.543
- Yeah.
Yeah, he's happy.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.011
He's doing physical therapy
in Laguna Beach,

07:58.045 --> 08:01.248
and he's got some kind of lead
with the U.S. Park Police, so...

08:01.281 --> 08:04.084
- You miss him.
Is that what this is all about?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.987
- No.
I'm pissed off, man.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.056
I get grounded,
and this is my case?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.759
I mean, I know more about how
Yates thinks than Carisi does.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.293
- Olivia's just looking out
for you, Amanda.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.664
- Yeah?
How do you figure?

08:16.697 --> 08:19.099
- You're good at getting
inside these guys' heads.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.804
Don't let them get
inside yours.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.716
- Oh, no, bikes, toys--
she's a mom.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.017
- No, they're not hers.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.621
If a mom disappears, they file
a missing persons report.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.456
[doorbell rings]

08:43.490 --> 08:45.993
[dog barks]

08:47.961 --> 08:49.830
- Can I help you?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.866
- Uh, Yeah, we're NYPD, um,
Manhattan Special Victims Unit.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.702
We're looking
for a Brooke Groves.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.103
- That's me.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.006
Actually, it was me.
I'm Brooke Norwalk now.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.445
Hey, Tommy, Bobby,
go play on the iPad.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.618
Did something happen
to my husband?

09:10.651 --> 09:11.919
- No.
- No, no, no.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.487
Um, we thought something
happened to you.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.723
- I don't understand.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.324
- It must have been a mistake,

09:17.357 --> 09:20.427
but we got a body
in the morgue, actually.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.164
- Oh, no.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.267
Rachel.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.105
My twin sister.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.941
- Are you still in touch
with her?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.976
- Off and on.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.545
My husband doesn't know that.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.114
Those boys
have never even...

09:41.148 --> 09:43.283
After they were born,
my husband--

09:43.316 --> 09:46.253
he said she couldn't come
around anymore.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.356
- She had problems?

09:49.389 --> 09:51.892
- Rachel went to pieces
after our mom died--

09:51.925 --> 09:53.460
drinking, drugs.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.664
She'd call me from the city,
swear she was going to get help.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.668
I'd go into the city
and give her money.

10:00.668 --> 10:05.272
A few months ago,
she called again really high,

10:05.305 --> 10:08.575
and I told her
I was done enabling her.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.681
[sighs]

10:13.714 --> 10:15.048
How...

10:17.384 --> 10:19.352
What happened to my sister?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.790
- I ran the DNA again.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.192
You two were
identical twins, yes?

10:25.225 --> 10:28.161
- That's right.
When we were young, we...

10:28.195 --> 10:30.197
[sniffles]
Used to dress alike.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.132
No one could tell us apart.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.835
- Brace yourself. There's
significant decomposition.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.738
[metal curtain whirs]

10:37.771 --> 10:40.708
- [gasps]

10:42.409 --> 10:45.112
It's Rachel.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.148
[sobbing]

10:51.719 --> 10:53.453
- I'm very sorry
for your loss.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.992
- [continues sobbing]

11:03.363 --> 11:05.999
- Rachel Groves--
she stayed here on and off.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.735
She was murdered?
- Yeah.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.903
We think she was targeted
'cause she was on the fringes.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.504
- Somebody
who wouldn't be missed.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.240
- Rachel was troubled.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.575
That's why I was so happy
when her mother came for her.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.745
- Mother?
- I think it was her mother.

11:17.745 --> 11:21.048
The last time I saw Rachel,
she left with an older woman--

11:21.081 --> 11:22.582
gray hair, nicely dressed.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.851
- When was this?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.485
- I'd have to check.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.321
It was still cold--
March, April.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.159
I remember the woman
had a long coat and a hat on.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.761
- Okay, do you have
security cameras here?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.764
- Yes.
Come, follow me.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.267
[telephones ringing
in the background]

11:42.435 --> 11:44.171
- So Rachel was last seen
with this woman.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.906
Can the sister ID her?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.174
- No, I mean, their mother
died ten years ago,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.275
and Brooke doesn't know

11:48.308 --> 11:49.943
any other female relatives
or friends.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.611
- So who is she?

11:51.644 --> 11:53.546
- Obviously not Yates.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.682
And look at the timecode--
April 15th.

11:55.783 --> 11:56.950
Yates was in custody.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.920
- April 15, 2012--
that's three years off.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.455
- Yeah, and obviously it's a.m.,
but it reads as 11:30 p.m.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.524
The timecode was glitched.
- Okay, so check the machine.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.359
See what it reads now
and then adjust it from there.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.861
- No, I tried that.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.997
They already reset it once they
realized it was out of whack.

12:10.030 --> 12:13.100
- I'll have TARU take a look.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.935
- And, um, Sergeant...

12:14.968 --> 12:17.670
in the meantime,
Yates called me twice.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.106
He says
he has more information.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.809
He won't talk
to anybody but me.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.944
- Go.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.146
But not by yourself.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.683
[indistinct chatter
in the background]

12:30.717 --> 12:34.988
[door buzzes, unlocks,
creaks open]

12:37.490 --> 12:39.126
- You...

12:39.159 --> 12:40.828
you brought backup.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.296
I thought this was gonna be
just between me and you.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.464
- You thought wrong.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.033
- We're here because we were
able to identify

12:46.066 --> 12:47.734
the victim from Pelham Bay.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.003
- You know, I already told you
that I had nothing

12:50.037 --> 12:51.671
to do with that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.640
- You also told me
that you would stew on this,

12:53.673 --> 12:56.476
that you might be able to come
up with more information.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.578
So it turns out...

12:58.611 --> 13:00.948
she had a twin sister.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.749
It sure would mean a lot
to someone

13:02.850 --> 13:04.885
if we could bring
her closure.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.153
- A twin?

13:06.186 --> 13:07.654
Huh...

13:07.687 --> 13:10.858
that is a real bond.

13:10.858 --> 13:15.762
I would like to help,
but this is a long shot.

13:15.863 --> 13:19.332
But I kept thinking
about those autopsy photos,

13:19.366 --> 13:21.902
the medical training,
the red hair,

13:21.935 --> 13:26.006
and suddenly I was reminded
of this incident that happened

13:26.039 --> 13:28.008
back when I was becoming
a senior resident.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.979
- That was what, in 2002?
- Yeah, about then.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.114
I got a call
from an attending.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.515
He needed stitches.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.885
- He called you?
Why not go to the hospital?

13:37.885 --> 13:39.987
- Because he was embarrassed.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.590
When I got to the town house,
I found out why.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.894
He had bruising and cuts

13:46.894 --> 13:48.461
and what appeared to be

13:48.495 --> 13:51.598
human bite marks
on his inner thigh and scrotum.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.334
He claimed it happened
during some sex game gone awry.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.203
- But you don't believe him.
- No.

13:56.236 --> 14:00.607
I asked him if his partner
needed medical attention.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.376
He assured me
that she was fine

14:03.410 --> 14:05.212
and that she had left.

14:05.245 --> 14:09.582
Whoever she was, I could sense
that she was still in the house.

14:09.616 --> 14:13.720
There was a clump of red hair
on the floorboards,

14:13.753 --> 14:15.722
and I...

14:15.755 --> 14:17.925
I could smell her.
- Okay, Doc.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.560
- No.
Really, I could,

14:20.593 --> 14:22.795
and it wasn't the sex,
and it wasn't the hormones.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.197
It was her fear.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.634
It has a very real scent,
like ammonia.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.669
- What was the name
of the attending?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.771
- [chuckles]

14:31.804 --> 14:33.740
I don't want
to incriminate anybody.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.042
I...

14:35.075 --> 14:38.745
I could be wrong, but...

14:38.778 --> 14:41.248
I remember the street,
though...

14:41.281 --> 14:43.483
Convent Avenue in Harlem.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.624
The town house
has a lovely Juliet balcony.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.869
- Sarge, Fin,
I wasn't expecting you.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.504
These are the Changs.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.573
They bought the house four years
ago, did a renovation.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.375
Before that,
it had fallen into disrepair

15:08.408 --> 15:10.810
after the 2007 death
of Manon Favreau.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.445
She was a widow
whose husband's family

15:12.479 --> 15:13.880
actually built this house
in the 1880s.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.348
- Thanks for
the history lesson, Carisi.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.150
Who lived here in 2002?

15:17.184 --> 15:18.651
- We're looking at tax records,
utility bills,

15:18.685 --> 15:19.819
but realistically--

15:19.852 --> 15:21.588
- Yates could just be
pulling Rollins' chain.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.990
- I don't see
what he gets out of that.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.757
So we're here.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.759
The couple's given us permission
to do a noninvasive search?

15:26.793 --> 15:28.028
- Yeah,
but after all this time,

15:28.061 --> 15:29.629
what are the chances
we're going to find something?

15:29.662 --> 15:33.133
- Sergeant, you're here.
Come look at what we found.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.672
The CSU techs picked up an image
using the GPR.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.409
- What's that?
- Ground penetrating radar.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.611
- It's like a sonogram that can
see inside of that wall.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.015
- Yes. And see,
it used to be a chimney.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.850
- What's that shadow?
There's something in there.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.187
- I bet that's
another Yates victim.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.788
So what,
we rip down the wall?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.290
- Okay, go tell the owners

15:57.324 --> 16:00.527
that that noninvasive search
just became invasive.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.470
- A little help here.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.681
- It's a suitcase.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.251
- Great.
Let's get it out.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.190
- [grunts]
There's something inside.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.226
Should we open it?
- Yeah, go ahead.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.733
[camera shutter clicks]

16:51.111 --> 16:51.244
.

16:52.879 --> 16:53.413
- So Yates' tip paid off.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.549
There was a body
in the Harlem town house?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.618
- In the wall, mummified.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.320
- Anything else
in the house?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.855
- Fin and Carisi are searching
the place with CSU.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.291
We're getting a DNA sample.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.126
As soon as the ME
dates the decomp,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.127
search missing persons.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.328
- Why not just ask Yates?

17:08.361 --> 17:09.896
He's a convicted serial killer

17:09.929 --> 17:11.531
who tipped you off
to the location of a corpse

17:11.564 --> 17:13.333
in a house
where he also puts himself.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.567
- Rollins has been
working him.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.303
He swears
that it wasn't him.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.838
- [scoffs]
You've got to be kidding me.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.473
- The incisions
seem to have been made

17:20.507 --> 17:23.710
by a medical professional,
pubis and ilium scraped

17:23.743 --> 17:25.345
where they were separated
from the adductors.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.648
- So she was dissected
just like Rachel Groves was.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.417
- The muscle was cut
away from the bone.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.119
- [clears throat]
Mm.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.653
- Detective,
you look a little peaked.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.122
- I'm fine.
No, I'm good.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.157
- Dr. Rudnick, Rollins.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.159
- A sergeant
and an ADA at an autopsy--

17:39.192 --> 17:40.760
should I be nervous?

17:40.793 --> 17:41.894
- Can you tell us anything?

17:41.928 --> 17:44.564
- An autopsy like this
is an enigmatic puzzle.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.333
The body was cut, broken,

17:46.366 --> 17:49.736
and tied with an electrical cord
to fit in the suitcase.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.406
It had to be uncurled,
X-rayed, rehydrated.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.376
- Start at the beginning--
age, cause of death.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.378
- She was a white female.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.447
Uh, from her teeth,
I'd guess about 25.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.582
5'6",
in good physical health.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.616
- Cause of death?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.152
- The skull was fractured,

18:05.152 --> 18:07.754
but I believe the cause
was strangulation.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.689
The hyoid
was also fractured.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.624
The body was wrapped
in a blanket.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.361
The dry heat and smoke
from the common chimney

18:14.394 --> 18:16.529
effectively mummified
the remains,

18:16.563 --> 18:20.300
and she was in situ
for over a decade mostly likely.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.534
How is it she was discovered?

18:21.568 --> 18:23.170
- Actually, it was a tip
from Yates.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.837
- Dr. Yates?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.306
It's a tip or a confession?

18:26.339 --> 18:29.442
- Is this another one of his?
- I noted no nail polish.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.512
But the incisions do show
evidence of medical technique.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.982
And the fractured skull is
not inconsistent with Yates' MO.

18:36.015 --> 18:39.319
- But strangulation is,
and the victim was a redhead.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.454
- Yes, so was Rachel Groves.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.956
I'll need to do
a thorough examination.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.059
So far, I've found no trace
of the killer's DNA,

18:47.093 --> 18:51.998
which is also not inconsistent
with Yates' MO.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.667
- "Also not inconsistent
with Yates' MO."

18:54.701 --> 18:56.569
- That's ME talk for, "Yates did
it, but don't quote me."

18:56.603 --> 18:57.970
- Yates is appealing
his conviction.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.239
Why would he tip us off
to another victim?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.208
He's sick,
but he's not stupid.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.442
- Rollins, all due respect--

19:02.475 --> 19:03.710
- Don't start a sentence
that way.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.212
- Fine.

19:05.212 --> 19:08.114
If Yates didn't do it, then how
did he know that body was there?

19:08.215 --> 19:10.517
- [scoffs]

19:18.225 --> 19:20.593
- Your DA thinks I'm the one
who did this.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.830
You know, I am the one
who told you all about her.

19:23.863 --> 19:27.500
- That's exactly
why he thinks you did it.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.737
- Is he always so circular
in his reasoning?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.605
- You told me that you
were called to that house,

19:32.639 --> 19:35.608
that you knew
a woman was there.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.244
Do you know who she was?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.911
- I do.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.580
I even know who killed her.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.849
But...

19:42.882 --> 19:47.820
enough talk
about what I can do for you.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.090
Let's talk
about how you can help me.

19:51.123 --> 19:55.295
- Yates wants to touch
his fiancée, Susie Frain?

19:55.328 --> 19:56.829
Hasn't he touched
enough women already?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.665
- Look, they've been together
for 20 years.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.966
He's never hurt Susie.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.801
- And she's okay
with conjugal visits?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.136
- She called about it twice.
- Every pot has a lid.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.938
- Lovely.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.707
You do realize how this would
look if word got out, right?

20:07.740 --> 20:10.810
Yates is already on the hook
for multiple rapes and murder.

20:10.843 --> 20:14.180
Now he wants to trade crime tips
for conjugal visits.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.615
- If Yates
is telling the truth,

20:15.648 --> 20:17.116
there could be
another serial out there.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.485
- So pick your poison,
Counselor.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.220
- Fine.
Bring the fiancée upstate.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.655
Let them conjugate

20:22.689 --> 20:24.123
and then interrogate
both of them afterwards.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.758
You better be right
about this, Rollins.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.434
[woman moaning]

20:37.003 --> 20:38.705
- Okay, we good?

20:44.711 --> 20:46.379
- Time's up, coming in.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.554
- There you go.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.022
- Ms. Frain,
before you leave,

20:56.055 --> 20:58.558
uh, my detectives
have some questions for you.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.327
- No one told me
about this.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.596
- Oh, hey,
it's all right.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.732
Just tell the truth.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.403
- All right, we have some
questions for you too.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.906
- So much for afterglow,
but a deal's a deal.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.907
Come in here.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.744
We'll have more privacy.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.780
- I hope now that you've found
these two bodies,

21:20.813 --> 21:22.749
you'll be releasing Greg
as soon as possible.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.016
- Come again?

21:24.050 --> 21:26.619
- I always knew Greg
wasn't capable of these crimes.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.054
He was framed.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.556
The poor girl in Pelham Bay--

21:29.589 --> 21:31.858
she must have been murdered
after he was arrested,

21:31.891 --> 21:34.060
or you would have found the body
when you first searched.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.762
- Oh, did Greg tell you that?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.530
- It's common sense.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.932
And Lena--
we were all friends.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.368
Greg was fond of her.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.470
- Hold up.
Who--who's Lena?

21:43.503 --> 21:45.171
- Lena Grunwald--

21:45.204 --> 21:47.374
the girl in the wall.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.941
I thought she had gone home
to Switzerland,

21:48.975 --> 21:51.644
but she must have never left.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.012
- Lena was a lovely girl.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.181
She was over from Switzerland
for her doctorate,

21:55.214 --> 21:56.949
and they, uh--
they met at Columbia.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.385
- Met who?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.520
- Her fiancé.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.254
No.
[clears throat]

22:02.288 --> 22:04.090
When--The night
that I stitched him,

22:04.123 --> 22:06.593
he said that it was
a sex game gone wrong,

22:06.626 --> 22:08.761
but he had
to have tortured--

22:08.795 --> 22:11.598
[gasps]
Oh, he might have sealed her

22:11.631 --> 22:13.733
in that wall
while she was still alive.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.602
- Stay with us, Dr. Yates.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.036
- Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.405
That poor woman.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.407
- You were gonna
give us a name?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.274
- I was.
Apologies.

22:22.308 --> 22:23.576
Uh, Carl.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.579
Yes, when I was
a senior resident,

22:26.613 --> 22:27.747
he was an attending--

22:27.780 --> 22:31.551
strange man,
a little delicate, pale.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.787
He kept to himself, which was
why we were so sort of surprised

22:34.821 --> 22:36.823
when he got engaged to Lena

22:36.856 --> 22:39.225
- Does this delicate man
have a last name?

22:39.258 --> 22:41.528
- Rudnick.
Uh, Dr. Carl Rudnick.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.863
- That's it.
We're done.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.164
Rollins.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.067
- I went out on a limb for you.
- What?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.201
- You think this is a game?

22:49.235 --> 22:51.237
You are going to be transferred
so far upstate,

22:51.270 --> 22:52.439
your ass is gonna freeze.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.940
- Rollins, let's go.
- What did I say?

22:53.973 --> 22:57.744
- Dr. Carl Rudnick,
Deputy Chief Medical Examiner

22:57.777 --> 23:00.680
in the borough of Manhattan--
he's a serial killer.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.450
- Wait.
Carl became an ME?

23:03.450 --> 23:05.652
Oh, no, that--
that really is--

23:05.685 --> 23:07.654
that is--
that is perfect.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.156
He never liked people,
but he always liked cutting.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.458
- [scoffs]
Don't even try, Yates.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.459
- No, stay.
Please?

23:12.492 --> 23:13.993
I need to know.

23:14.026 --> 23:17.497
Did he do any of the autopsies
on the girls you found?

23:17.530 --> 23:19.466
Nadia maybe?

23:19.466 --> 23:22.268
Come on, a man like that
with all those female bodies

23:22.301 --> 23:23.836
being delivered
to the morgue

23:23.870 --> 23:27.740
having been tortured
to death?

23:27.774 --> 23:29.208
That is a trigger.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.743
He would get off on them,

23:30.777 --> 23:34.547
and then he would want to go
do another one for himself.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.149
That girl,
the girl in Pelham Bay...

23:38.818 --> 23:42.722
Did Rudnick do
her autopsy too?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.627
Have another ME
recheck the body.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.496
His report didn't say so,

23:49.496 --> 23:51.130
but I'll be you dollars
to doughnuts,

23:51.163 --> 23:54.400
he cut that girl up
while she was still alive.

24:07.614 --> 24:07.747
.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.381
- Accusing the Deputy Chief ME
of rape and murder?

24:10.650 --> 24:12.118
And they offered
this conspiracy theory

24:12.151 --> 24:13.620
right after
their conjugal visit.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.121
- Yeah, I know.
- He worked you two.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.723
- Or the fiancé worked us.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.591
Give Yates points.
That's a bold move.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.327
- I'm sorry. You all were right.
I was wrong.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.662
- Hold on, Rollins.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.631
Now, look,
I'm still only mid-search,

24:24.664 --> 24:26.298
but there was a Lena Grunwald

24:26.332 --> 24:28.000
from Switzerland who went
to Columbia at that time.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.202
Now, as far as I can tell,
she never graduates,

24:30.236 --> 24:33.005
she just disappears off the grid
in winter of 2002.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.007
- You actually looked
into this?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.543
- Yeah, Counselor, I did,

24:36.543 --> 24:38.177
because if Yates
is taking a flyer for an appeal,

24:38.210 --> 24:41.047
then we have to rule this out.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.149
Now, I'm still new here,

24:43.182 --> 24:45.451
but how well do you guys
know Carl Rudnick?

24:45.552 --> 24:47.019
- He got here
right before you did.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.155
He came out of Miami-Dade,
I think.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.257
- Carisi's right.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.693
Yates is looking
to overturn his conviction.

24:53.726 --> 24:54.861
Did Rudnick ever mention

24:54.894 --> 24:56.563
that he went to medical school
with Yates?

24:56.596 --> 24:57.830
- No, he didn't.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.566
- So what if he did?

24:59.566 --> 25:03.670
Yates kidnapped, raped,
tortured, and murdered Nadia.

25:03.703 --> 25:04.971
He is guilty.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.639
The only reason he's bringing up
conflicting evidence

25:06.673 --> 25:07.907
is for his appeal.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.341
- Still,
if they did know each other,

25:09.375 --> 25:10.677
then Rudnick
should have recused himself.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.211
- That's easy enough
to confirm.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.080
Then while you're at it, see
if Rudnick has any connection

25:14.113 --> 25:15.915
to the town house in Harlem

25:15.948 --> 25:18.985
or if he even knew this supposed
fiancé of Lena Grunwald.

25:22.221 --> 25:26.292
- That's Lena
with Carl, me, and Greg--

25:26.325 --> 25:28.327
New Year's Eve 2001
in Montreal.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.762
- So you knew each other
well enough

25:29.796 --> 25:31.330
that you all go
on vacation together.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.133
- Oh, yeah,
Canada, Europe a few times.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.602
Lena spoke French
and German.

25:35.602 --> 25:38.470
She was a great tour guide,
a lovely person.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.139
- What can you tell us
about her relationship

25:40.172 --> 25:41.741
with Carl Rudnick?

25:41.774 --> 25:43.142
- Tempestuous.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.811
They fought,
especially when they drank,

25:44.844 --> 25:46.212
and they both drank.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.180
She loved her Gewurztraminer.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.516
- Remember the last time
you saw her?

25:50.617 --> 25:53.285
- I remember when she left.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.322
Greg threw me a birthday party,
and Carl brought a new date.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.124
He said Lena
had broken off their engagement

25:58.157 --> 25:59.458
and moved back to Switzerland.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.793
- And that was...?

26:00.827 --> 26:03.329
- Early February 2002.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.530
- So you didn't think
it was strange

26:04.631 --> 26:06.866
that she didn't say good-bye
to you herself?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.234
- I did, actually.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.837
In Montreal,
they were going at each other.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.705
On the flight back,
Lena told me

26:12.739 --> 26:15.207
that if anything ever
happened to her, Carl did it.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.745
- Why didn't you
call the police?

26:18.778 --> 26:20.913
- I was going to,
but then I got a note from Lena

26:20.947 --> 26:24.083
with a photo of herself
in her village--Grindelwald.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.653
She apologized. She said
she just had to get away.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.955
- And you're sure
that it was her?

26:28.988 --> 26:30.757
- I thought it was.
- You think you may have kept

26:30.790 --> 26:32.091
that note and photo?

26:32.124 --> 26:34.326
- I have tons of boxes
in mini storage.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.898
You think it will help
if I find it?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.901
- Okay, so Rudnick and Yates
overlapped in medical school,

26:41.934 --> 26:44.771
and Lena was in business school
at the same time.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.239
- And Susie just told us
that they were all friends.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.409
- Which, as Carisi said,
Rudnick should have disclosed.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.311
- It still doesn't mean
that Rudnick is good for this.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.746
Remember, Rollins,

26:53.780 --> 26:56.749
Yates tried to pin Nadia's death
on Will Halsted.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.284
He's an opportunist.
- I know he is.

26:58.317 --> 27:02.254
And I know he's good for Nadia's
murder and a dozen before,

27:02.288 --> 27:04.691
but this woman in the wall...

27:04.691 --> 27:07.694
I'm not sure about,
'cause look, I did a search.

27:07.727 --> 27:12.364
I was trying to find who exactly
lived in this house in 2002.

27:12.398 --> 27:17.336
Now, ConEd and phone bills
both went to Manon Favreau.

27:17.369 --> 27:19.571
The name on the cable bill...

27:19.605 --> 27:21.874
it's under Carl Rudnick.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.911
- While it was owned
by Manon Favreau?

27:24.944 --> 27:26.713
So he was renting.
- More like house-sitting.

27:26.713 --> 27:31.350
It turns out, the maiden name
was Manon Rudnick.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.785
She's Carl Rudnick's
great-aunt.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.286
I mean,
these ancestry Websites--

27:34.320 --> 27:35.888
you'd be surprised
what they know about you.

27:35.922 --> 27:38.557
- Okay, so Rudnick neglected
to mention that the body

27:38.590 --> 27:41.060
that we found
was in his aunt's house

27:41.093 --> 27:43.462
and he was living there when it
was plastered in the wall.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.532
- Damn,
he autopsied his own fiancée?

27:46.565 --> 27:48.901
- 13 years
after he killed her.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.369
- We don't know that yet.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.304
We don't even know
if the body is Lena's.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.874
- Susie told us that Lena sent
her a picture of herself

27:54.907 --> 27:56.075
from Switzerland.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.609
- Well, if she did send
that photo,

27:57.643 --> 27:59.078
that's the last trace of her.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.113
- Do we have any proof
that the body was hers?

28:01.147 --> 28:03.115
DNA, dental records, anything?

28:03.149 --> 28:04.851
- I called Warner.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.754
She said according to Rudnick,
there's no way to ID her.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.221
- There's a shock.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.657
- Okay, I'll call
the Chief Medical Examiner

28:11.758 --> 28:13.292
and see
if he'll authorize Warner

28:13.325 --> 28:16.295
to independently redo
both autopsies,

28:16.328 --> 28:19.031
preferably
when Rudnick's not there.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.369
- The body's well-preserved,

28:23.402 --> 28:26.038
most likely from
the frigid water temperatures,

28:26.072 --> 28:27.573
which last well into April.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.075
- Let's stop here.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.811
Dr. Rudnick's time of death
may be mistaken.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.080
- Maybe?
- He says early April.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.848
But based
on the crime-scene photos,

28:35.882 --> 28:38.818
it appears the body wasn't
wrapped in plastic or a tarp.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.552
- Wait.
That's in his report.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.655
- Yes, but if this body went
into the water in mid-April,

28:43.689 --> 28:47.159
the fish or crabs would have
nibbled away at the soft tissue.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.895
- So it's more likely
early May.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.329
- I think so.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.664
I'm surprised, frankly.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.033
It's careless.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.802
Dr. Rudnick is meticulous
to a fault.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.837
He's one of the top MEs
in the country.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.205
- What else do you know
about him?

28:59.238 --> 29:01.207
- He's a guy
who works six days a week,

29:01.240 --> 29:02.809
never puts in for overtime.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.911
We all figure family money.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.613
He's obsessed with his work.
- Okay, okay.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.681
So his timeline is off.

29:09.715 --> 29:12.985
Is it possible
that he's overworked?

29:13.019 --> 29:16.188
- Maybe. And here's
another omission I noticed.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.624
His report neglects to mention
that the dismemberment

29:18.657 --> 29:20.492
took place antemortem.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.632
- So Rachel Groves was alive.
Are you sure?

29:26.665 --> 29:28.167
- Positive.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.038
Cutting into live tissue
always causes a vital reaction

29:32.071 --> 29:34.273
markedly different
from cutting into dead tissue.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.208
- And there's no way
an ME would leave this out

29:36.242 --> 29:38.577
or possibly mistake the two?

29:38.610 --> 29:42.148
- No. Now, you want to tell me
what this is about?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.885
- I'm sorry, Melinda.
I can't.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.855
This is, uh,
an active investigation.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.928
- Before I re-autopsy
this mummified body,

29:55.962 --> 29:57.196
is there anything I should know?

29:57.229 --> 30:00.532
- Uh, well,
she may be a Swiss national.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.368
We haven't been able to ID her.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.769
- That may be helpful.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.504
- Okay.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.406
[door opens]

30:07.439 --> 30:11.010
- Melinda, watch your back
with Rudnick.

30:18.985 --> 30:19.118
.

30:19.886 --> 30:20.419
- What am I looking at here?

30:21.854 --> 30:23.923
- It's proof that the body
in that wall was Lena Grunwald.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.691
Okay, Warner
found these gold overlays

30:25.724 --> 30:29.095
on her teeth that are specific
to German-Swiss dentists.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.030
- Yeah, another detail
Dr. Rudnick did not put

30:31.063 --> 30:32.498
in his autopsy report.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.233
- We confirmed with her dentist
in Switzerland.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.834
It is Lena's body.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.169
- She never went home.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.504
- Well, here's
where it gets tricky.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.172
I finally heard back
from my guy at TSA.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.540
Now, according to them,

30:41.573 --> 30:43.709
Lena Grunwald
left JFK for Zurich

30:43.742 --> 30:46.245
on February 11, 2002.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.847
- So? We can't pinpoint
her time of death.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.716
She must have come back,
been murdered sometime later.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.385
- Yeah, but there's no record
of her coming back.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.221
So, on a hunch,
I looked at Rudnick's travel.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.556
Now, this guy--he's got
the opposite problem, all right?

30:57.589 --> 31:00.459
He returned from Paris to JFK
on February 15th,

31:00.492 --> 31:03.195
but there's no record of him
leaving the U.S. or even Canada.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.097
- Okay, you got a theory
to go with this travelogue?

31:05.131 --> 31:08.467
- What if Rudnick left the U.S.
using Lena's passport

31:08.500 --> 31:11.603
and then came back as himself?

31:11.637 --> 31:16.275
- You're suggesting he was able
to pass as a woman post 9/11?

31:16.308 --> 31:19.545
- Yeah, a red-haired lady
with a Swiss passport--

31:19.578 --> 31:22.281
so outside their profile, nobody
took a second look at her.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.483
- And Rachel,
the victim from the bay--

31:24.516 --> 31:27.119
I mean, she was last seen
leaving her shelter with a woman

31:27.153 --> 31:28.955
or someone dressed like one.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.990
- Using facial-recognition
software?

31:31.023 --> 31:32.158
- We are.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.592
Olivia's headed to 1PP now

31:33.625 --> 31:36.462
to get the okay to bring Rudnick
in for questioning.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.829
- Call her off.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.731
We'll ask forgiveness later.

31:39.765 --> 31:42.134
For now, I'll find a pretext
to invite him to my office.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.136
- So, while he's with you, how
about a warrant for his house.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.973
You know, knives, dresses--
who knows what we'll find?

31:49.875 --> 31:51.343
[sighs]

31:51.377 --> 31:52.444
- Please come in.

31:52.478 --> 31:53.612
Dr. Rudnick,
just so you know,

31:53.645 --> 31:55.214
everything in this room
is recorded.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.448
Have a seat.

31:56.482 --> 31:59.485
Um, Yates
is appealing his conviction,

31:59.518 --> 32:01.220
so this conversation
may be discoverable

32:01.253 --> 32:02.654
as part of that process.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.491
- Of course,
I also record everything.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.226
Oh, Sergeant Benson.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.396
- Yes. Dr. Rudnick, thank you
so much for meeting us.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.098
Just have a few questions
for you.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.465
- Certainly.

32:16.302 --> 32:20.406
- Okay, this file--
do you recognize it?

32:20.439 --> 32:24.210
- Yes, it's the autopsy report

32:24.243 --> 32:26.512
of the Jane Doe
you found mummified--

32:26.545 --> 32:28.180
the Yates victim.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.915
- And the address
where the body was found--

32:30.016 --> 32:31.650
do you recognize that?

32:31.683 --> 32:34.553
- That's bizarre.
I never noticed the address.

32:34.586 --> 32:38.624
My eyes were
on the poor girl's remains.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.492
- So you do recognize
the address?

32:40.526 --> 32:42.194
- It was
my great-aunt's house.

32:42.228 --> 32:45.297
- Look at this.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.666
He keeps
autopsy photos bedside.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.102
- He'll probably claim
he takes his work home with him.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.838
- And this woman,
do you recognize her?

32:52.871 --> 32:55.041
- Yes, of course,
that's Lena Grunwald,

32:55.041 --> 32:58.510
an old flame of mine
from 15 years ago.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.379
I'm sorry.
What's this all about?

33:00.412 --> 33:03.249
- We believe the body found
in the wall of your aunt's house

33:03.282 --> 33:05.417
was Lena Grunwald.

33:09.955 --> 33:12.724
- Oh, my God.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.893
I didn't recognize her.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.395
And how could I
in that state?

33:16.428 --> 33:18.530
Are you suggesting
I autopsied my ex?

33:18.564 --> 33:20.499
- So you didn't know
that she was dead?

33:20.532 --> 33:21.600
- Well, of course not.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.801
Last time I saw her
was at the airport

33:22.834 --> 33:25.071
when she left
for Switzerland.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.605
She must have come back
without my knowledge

33:26.638 --> 33:29.541
and fallen back in
with Yates.

33:29.575 --> 33:33.545
- Who took her to your
aunt's house, killed her,

33:33.579 --> 33:35.547
and entombed her in the wall?

33:35.581 --> 33:37.749
That's an incredible
coincidence.

33:37.783 --> 33:38.984
- Not really.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.586
We all knew each other,

33:40.619 --> 33:42.654
and I occasionally entertained
at that home.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.257
- So you and Yates
knew each other?

33:45.291 --> 33:47.426
- Yes, of course,
it's public knowledge.

33:47.459 --> 33:51.297
We were at med school at
the same time a few years apart.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.233
He was always
rather jealous of me.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.901
- You and Yates
were colleagues.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.370
Did you ever think
to mention that to anyone?

33:58.404 --> 33:59.971
- Well, frankly, no.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.641
- When did you last
hear from Lena?

34:02.674 --> 34:04.643
- We broke up
amidst a hard winter.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.313
It was 2002, 2003.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.681
That son of a bitch...

34:09.715 --> 34:12.118
He always had
a thing for Lena,

34:12.118 --> 34:14.653
and killing her is his way
of hurting me.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.122
- He did this to hurt you,

34:16.122 --> 34:20.126
and you didn't know about it
for 13 years.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.393
- Well, what other explanation
could there be?

34:21.427 --> 34:23.529
He knew the house.
He knew her.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.197
And he's
a convicted serial killer.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.133
Ipso facto...

34:34.140 --> 34:36.742
Oh, you can't think that I had
anything to do with this.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.744
- We can't.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.313
- Oh, it's patently absurd.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.551
- Dr. Rudnick...

34:45.584 --> 34:47.786
then you wouldn't mind

34:47.819 --> 34:50.956
working through some
of the other inconsistencies

34:50.989 --> 34:51.957
that we found.

34:51.990 --> 34:54.059
- Well, not at all.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.728
Given the change
in tenor of this conversation,

34:56.762 --> 34:58.464
I'm contacting my lawyer.

34:58.497 --> 35:01.700
I'd like to exercise
that right.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.536
- [sighs]
Feel free.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.373
We will wait to continue
questioning you

35:07.406 --> 35:08.807
until a lawyer arrives.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.390
- You realize that if he is
guilty,

35:24.423 --> 35:25.991
then every case
he's testified in--

35:26.024 --> 35:28.494
- I know.
Every autopsy he's performed--

35:28.527 --> 35:29.728
I don't even want to think

35:29.761 --> 35:31.463
about how many convictions
will have to be reopened.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.999
- Oh.
- Olivia.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.234
- Rita, what are
you doing here?

35:35.267 --> 35:36.502
- I was working out
a plea deal

35:36.535 --> 35:38.504
when I got a message from Carl.
- Carl.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.506
- You're representing
Dr. Rudnick.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.541
- Everyone is entitled
to the best defense

35:42.574 --> 35:43.842
they can afford.

35:43.875 --> 35:47.479
And Dr. Rudnick or his family
can afford a very good one.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.681
- And that, of course,
is all that matters.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.217
- My client's waiting.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.052
He'll be coming with me.
He is done talking to you.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.224
- Actually...

35:58.224 --> 35:59.691
he won't be leaving.

36:05.297 --> 36:08.734
- Rita, it's very good of you
to come on such short notice.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.270
- Of course, Carl, but I'm
afraid I have some bad news.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.839
- Carl Rudnick,
you're under arrest

36:13.872 --> 36:16.975
for the murders of Rachel Groves
and Lena Grunwald.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.777
You have the right
to remain silent.

36:18.810 --> 36:19.945
Anything you say can

36:19.978 --> 36:21.947
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.282
You have the right
to an attorney...

36:28.287 --> 36:28.387
.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.256
- Dr. Rudnick,
how do you plead?

36:31.089 --> 36:32.524
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.926
He's a respected
Deputy Chief Medical Examiner

36:34.960 --> 36:36.161
for the borough of Manhattan.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.429
- I'm aware of that,
Counselor.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.965
- With an impeccable
reputation.

36:39.998 --> 36:43.302
We request ROR as the charges
are, on their face, ridiculous.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.870
- Mr. Barba?
- Dr. Rudnick

36:44.903 --> 36:47.273
has been charged with two counts
of first-degree murder,

36:47.306 --> 36:49.841
one in which the victim
was vivisected.

36:49.875 --> 36:53.645
The other was found entombed in
the wall of his family's home.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.281
He's already tampered
with evidence.

36:55.281 --> 36:58.384
His position has allowed him
to cover up the crimes.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.886
Through several family trusts,

37:00.919 --> 37:03.088
he has the means
and the motive to flee,

37:03.121 --> 37:04.756
and we have reason to believe

37:04.790 --> 37:07.626
that he has traveled
internationally using passports

37:07.659 --> 37:09.094
from one of his victims
in the past.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.096
- Dr. Rudnick only
became a suspect

37:11.129 --> 37:14.433
based on false accusations
by serial killer Greg Yates

37:14.466 --> 37:16.302
in a desperate attempt
to throw doubt

37:16.302 --> 37:17.569
on his own conviction.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.937
- Even if that's true,

37:18.970 --> 37:20.739
I'm sure the state
would not waste my time

37:20.772 --> 37:22.808
if they didn't have
more compelling evidence.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.410
Dr. Rudnick,

37:24.443 --> 37:26.945
you are to surrender
your passport to the court.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.080
Bail is set at $2 million.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.983
[gavel bangs]

37:32.017 --> 37:34.119
- Rudnick posted
a $2 million bail?

37:34.152 --> 37:36.087
- There's no money
like family money.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.989
It was wired in
before he was even processed.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.758
- Whoa.
- Hey, check this out.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.127
"The ME Nobody Knows."

37:42.160 --> 37:43.829
"A Monster in the Morgue."

37:43.862 --> 37:45.997
I mean, these headlines--
they write themselves.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.400
- This is a freaky story.
- Yeah.

37:48.434 --> 37:51.337
- Getting freakier
by the minute.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.839
- Mommy and Noah
will get a little time later.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.441
There you go, sweetie.
- Okay.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.476
- All right.
[smooches] I love you.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.346
- Sarge, you're going
to want to see this!

38:00.346 --> 38:02.348
- Great.
You got something?

38:02.348 --> 38:04.082
- Yeah, facial recognition
came back.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.152
That TSA photo,
it's definitely not Lena.

38:07.185 --> 38:08.820
The jawline
is wide by two centimeters.

38:08.854 --> 38:10.121
The symmetry is wrong.

38:10.155 --> 38:12.558
And they also say it's not
inconsistent with Rudnick.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.560
- This guy has a closet
full of wigs and dresses.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.794
We know it's him.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.563
- We may know it's Rudnick,
but Barba wants proof.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.230
We need that photo
of Lena in Switzerland

38:19.264 --> 38:20.899
that he sent to Susie.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.034
- Well, I've been trying
to reach Susie. So far, no luck.

38:23.068 --> 38:26.538
- All right, Rollins,
let's call Yates, now.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.407
- Something happened to Susie.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.576
She was supposed
to call this morning.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.110
She would never just forget.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.712
- When's the last time
you talked to her?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.381
- Last night.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.416
She said she had good news.
- Good news?

38:37.449 --> 38:39.551
- She said
that she had found the photo

38:39.585 --> 38:41.787
that Lena supposedly sent
from Switzerland.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.924
She felt it looked a lot
like Rudnick in drag.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.693
- Was she going to tell
Rudnick that?

38:47.726 --> 38:49.895
- No, I don't think so.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.431
Wait. he's still in custody,
isn't he?

38:52.464 --> 38:55.066
- No, he made bail
last night.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.737
- Oh, no.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.306
[sirens wailing]

39:01.407 --> 39:02.808
- She's not here?

39:02.841 --> 39:05.310
- No, and I doubt she went
alone willingly.

39:19.591 --> 39:23.328
- Blood is mostly dried.
It's been a while.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.597
- Get a BOLO
out on Rudnick asap.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.566
Then head over
to Real Time Crime.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.835
We're going to need
a task force, TARU,

39:29.868 --> 39:31.302
TSA, Port Authority Police.

39:31.336 --> 39:34.239
You know the drill.
- On it.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.007
- Hey, Sarge.
Sarge.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.477
I might have heard something
come over the borough-wide.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.746
Got freshly cut body parts
coming in with the tide.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.749
- Cut?
Were they female?

39:45.617 --> 39:48.053
[sighs]

39:50.556 --> 39:51.790
What do we have?

39:51.823 --> 39:54.059
- Well, we're still putting
the pieces together.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.362
Some fishermen saw the bags
coming in about an hour ago.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.730
- This is
why I hate fishing.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.998
Learned that growing up
in Staten Island.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.233
- We're a long way
from Elmhurst.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.471
We're not sure it's Susie.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.221
- We are now.

41:10.035 --> 41:13.038
[wolf howls]
