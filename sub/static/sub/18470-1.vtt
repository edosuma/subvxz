00:12.960 --> 00:17.030
- Squadron leader? - Yes, thank you
very much. - There you go. - Lovely.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.350
John?

00:36.400 --> 00:38.280
One. One.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.470
And to sum up -- my
plans for Little Auburn

00:47.520 --> 00:50.830
ensure that we, the
people of Great Auburn,

00:50.880 --> 00:55.870
can feel connected to a
vital part of our history.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.310
A living museum is the perfect choice

01:00.360 --> 01:04.629
for the reopening of the
village of Little Auburn.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.880
Here, here. Well done, Mummy.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.960
Thank you, Sylvia.

01:16.440 --> 01:20.030
Thank you to all three finalists
for your presentations

01:20.080 --> 01:23.470
and thank you for being so
patient during this long process.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.990
For 75 years, Little Auburn
has been taken from us

01:27.040 --> 01:30.270
but now we are at the start
of a new and exciting chapter.

01:30.320 --> 01:37.230
All three proposals for Little Auburn's
future are splendid in their own way.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.590
- Midsomer Luxury Villas.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.040
- Auburn Eco Village.
- Whoo!

01:45.120 --> 01:48.190
And, of course, Sylvia
Lennard's living museum.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.240
- The only possible choice!
- Hear, hear.

01:52.280 --> 01:56.670
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow
morning for the opening of Little Auburn

01:56.720 --> 02:01.110
where we will all visit the village for
the first time since the Second World War.

02:01.160 --> 02:07.880
The army will be handing the lease back to my
family and I will then choose who takes it over.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.830
- So thank you to everyone
and enjoy the party. - Whoo!

02:31.000 --> 02:34.110
I think I'd better go and see
how Grandpa's getting on.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.960
- Do you need a hand, Dad?
- Go on, then. - Granddad!

02:38.640 --> 02:41.070
Not made much of an effort, Sylvia.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.990
I thought you still had some
of those dresses from the '40s.

02:45.040 --> 02:50.400
You haven't changed your clothes since the Second
World War and you have no sense of community!

02:56.800 --> 03:00.790
So,... have you, er, decided yet?

03:00.840 --> 03:03.790
- Can't be easy.
- You'll have to wait.

03:03.840 --> 03:11.000
If you go for Finn and Corina's bid,
it'd be a great opportunity to unite
the whole family, wouldn't it?

03:16.200 --> 03:18.870
But Dad's not giving anything away.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.800
I'm off.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.590
- Come on, let's dance.
- Not really in the mood.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.310
- I want to celebrate.
- When the people can have their village back.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.360
From what I know, it could
be sooner rather than later.

03:41.720 --> 03:46.830
- Tell me all about it. - You'll
know tomorrow. I'm going back to
the village. Stay here tonight.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.480
You're too drunk to cycle anyway.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.720
My leg.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.440
Agh!

05:47.400 --> 05:50.070
I now declare the village open!

06:59.800 --> 07:02.280
Look what I just found.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.960
That dog was a champion burier.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.230
What have you told Betty?

07:14.280 --> 07:16.590
I told her the truth gently --

07:16.640 --> 07:20.000
that Sykes was old and
his body stopped working.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.630
But we'll always remember
him and love him.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.310
Nelson sent his condolences.
He called yesterday.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.990
- How's he getting on with his
undercover course? - Loving it.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.070
Doing really well, so I hear.
No sign of him coming back yet.

07:35.120 --> 07:40.790
- How are you getting on with the
temporary sergeants? - You can meet
the latest. He's picking me up.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.670
Hey. Can your doggy chase a ball?

07:44.720 --> 07:46.590
Go on, chase it.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.580
Chase it. Chase it.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.790
- Where do you want to go first,
Mummy? - I thought we might start
with the church. - Then Granny's grave.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.230
We haven't got long cos I
need to get back to work.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.510
I'll take as long as I like!

08:06.560 --> 08:10.870
- I've waited all my life for this day.
- Of course, we get that.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.960
Then perhaps you'll understand
I'd rather be alone.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.960
Cheery as ever.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.110
What the...?!

08:58.240 --> 09:00.980
- Corina!
- Corina, what's happened?

09:01.480 --> 09:03.120
Corina?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.040
Oh, my...

09:09.320 --> 09:11.720
Come on, come here. Come here.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.760
Come here, darling.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.310
- Shall I comb his nose? I think
Doggy likes -- - Here, here.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.830
Yes, I need to comb his wheels.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.750
Sliding away...

09:27.800 --> 09:31.680
Wheels? No? Just do his... Oh, OK.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.550
Hi.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.990
Hi, I'm Jamie. You must be the boss' wife.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.750
- Ah, yes, Sarah. Come in.
- Thank you.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.670
- Just go through.
- Thanks.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.030
- Go on, then.
- We introduced ourselves.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.990
- Winter.
- Morning, sir.

09:55.040 --> 10:00.030
I'm not taking you to the office. There's a
body on the village green in Little Auburn.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.310
I take it there are
suspicious circumstances.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.750
If being run over by a tank
is suspicious, then, yeah.

10:06.800 --> 10:10.430
That's the village the army took
over. Isn't it about to reopen?

10:10.480 --> 10:15.950
- Due to be handed back to the owners
today. - Evidentially they didn't
take all their hardware with them.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.430
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.820
I'm Jamie. What's your name?

10:22.360 --> 10:23.900
It's Betty.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.840
Bye-bye, Betty. Mwah.
I've got to go to work now.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.670
Mwah.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.030
Mwah.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.400
Mwah.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.820
They're on their way to you now.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.710
- Morning, Kam.
- Oh, morning, sir.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.030
- What have we got?
- A male in his early 30s.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.070
Major trauma to the legs and
torso. Excessive internal bleeding.

11:25.120 --> 11:29.350
Injuries and markings all consistent
with having been struck by this.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.300
- The injuries to the head and face --
- Kam Karimore?!

11:33.960 --> 11:38.710
- I didn't expect to run into you in deepest
Midsomer! - You're the latest sergeant?

11:38.760 --> 11:43.550
- I take it you two have met. - Kam and I did
a training course together. Five years ago?

11:43.600 --> 11:49.390
- Six. - You're right. We were in this
big old house in Dorset. There was a
billiard table and Kam used to win --

11:49.440 --> 11:53.960
- Can you save the reminiscences for
another time, do you think? - Sorry, sir.

11:56.320 --> 12:01.190
As I was saying, the facial
injuries are superficial.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.870
A graze and a bump to the forehead,
bits of gravel on the cheeks.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.630
I looked like that when I came
off my bike on Tower Bridge.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.470
- Do we know who the victim is?
- Finn Thornberry.

12:12.520 --> 12:18.590
- His body was found when the village
was opened this morning. - He's been
dead between 10 and 12 hours.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.160
- He obviously got in here last night.
- Thank you, Kam.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.800
I wonder why he was here.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.320
And who would use a
tank as a murder weapon?

12:48.720 --> 12:51.990
- Corina Craven?
- Yes.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.070
I'm DCI Barnaby, Causton
CID. This is DS Winter.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.390
- I'll leave you to it, Chief Inspector.
- Thank you, Mr...?

12:59.440 --> 13:04.030
Craven, Roderick Craven. I'm Corina's
father. This is my niece Dottie Craven.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.680
Mr Craven, we'd like to talk
to you later. Don't go far.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.480
Come on, Dottie.

13:14.120 --> 13:19.270
- When was the last time you saw
Finn Thornberry alive? - Last night.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.750
We were at a party at The Cross Keys

13:23.800 --> 13:26.390
to celebrate the reopening
of Little Auburn.

13:26.440 --> 13:30.140
What was he doing in a
deserted village in the dark?

13:30.920 --> 13:34.070
- Oh, we've been living here.
- Living here?

13:34.120 --> 13:35.710
Where exactly?

13:35.760 --> 13:40.390
Squatting in one of the cottages to
help the Auburn Eco Village project.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.750
Why would that help?

13:42.800 --> 13:47.070
We want to rebuild Little Auburn,
make it a proper community again.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.310
We're just waiting for my
father to make a decision.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.720
If he decides against us,
he'll have to throw us out.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.840
Do you know of anyone who might
want to harm your boyfriend?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.280
No.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.880
Are there rival schemes to yours?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.150
Yes, but none of them would
do anything like this.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.110
Could you tell us who his
next of kin is please?

14:14.160 --> 14:18.990
Erm, his mother Andrea is married to
my Uncle Milo. Finn's his step-son.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.830
They're here in the village today.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.470
Thank you.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.040
- Can you tell us where this squat is?
- It's this way.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.840
One more thing, why didn't you come
back here with Finn last night?

14:39.520 --> 14:43.640
I was tired so I slept in the pub.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.000
This way.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.750
It's just in here.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.120
Thank you.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.590
- Not exactly a comfortable arrangement.
- Looks like someone got here before us.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.380
I wonder what they were looking for.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.640
In here, sir.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.120
It was hidden in the stairs, sir.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.360
Interesting.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.070
You go and see if Kam has found
anything else on the body.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.910
Then talk to the
landowner, Roderick Craven.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.900
I'll track down Finn Thornberry's mother.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.320
Mr Craven.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.200
- Thank you.
- Sir.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.150
Did you know that Finn and Corina were
squatting here in one of the cottages?

16:30.200 --> 16:33.150
It made no difference to
me, personally or legally.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.990
If you'd chosen a rival bid and had to evict
them, the local press would have a field day.

16:38.040 --> 16:42.750
- "Landowner evicts own daughter."
- Corina would never have let it come to that.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.310
What about Finn Thornberry?

16:45.360 --> 16:48.670
Well, I'm sure he'd have made
hay whilst the sun shone.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.310
- Did you not get on with your daughter's
boyfriend? - Not in the slightest.

16:53.360 --> 16:58.870
But my daughter thought very highly of him.
I had no choice but to trust her judgement.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.430
And had you made a decision on
the winning bid for the village?

17:02.480 --> 17:06.640
Even if I had, this is
hardly the right moment.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.030
Wait here.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.990
- The wire's new.
- So the killer set a trap

17:20.040 --> 17:22.109
to knock the victim off his bike

17:22.160 --> 17:24.150
before driving at him with the tank.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.750
Tanks are slow things. It's better to have
a target that can't dodge out of the way.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.110
- Why did you move the tank? - We had to
move it forward so it was clear of the body.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.100
Don't worry. We dusted for prints first.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.070
How did you start it? Isn't driving
a tank a specialised skill?

17:40.120 --> 17:44.110
It had been hotwired and
the mechanism is very basic.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.550
It's not specialised at all. If you can
drive a golf buggy, you can drive a tank.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.320
That's a pity -- throws our
field of suspects wide open.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.170
Jamie!

18:03.280 --> 18:07.680
Sorry, I don't know what's
happened. I'll fix it.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.790
Mrs Craven, I'm sorry to have
to ask you these questions

18:14.840 --> 18:18.400
- at such a difficult time.
- It's OK, please.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.800
Did your son have any
enemies in the village?

18:24.800 --> 18:26.390
No, of course not.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.550
Well, he could be a bit arrogant.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.430
Confident, you mean.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.720
And had he been particularly
confident about the competition?

18:36.720 --> 18:39.870
He has made it clear that
he thought he should win.

18:39.920 --> 18:44.160
Yeah, but everybody knew it wasn't
personal. They all understood that.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.520
Except Sylvia Lennard.

18:48.520 --> 18:51.390
- Sylvia Lennard?
- One of the other entrants.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.240
- Had she singled Finn out?
- Oh, no.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.640
Sylvia distributed her
scorn fairly evenly.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.960
We found this among Finn's possessions.
Do you recognise the woman or the child?

19:08.720 --> 19:10.160
No.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.400
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.430
You're all free to go.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.280
This way.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.630
Although perhaps you and
I should have a chat.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.190
The photograph. You recognised them.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.990
- No. - Josh, your brother
has just been murdered.

19:40.040 --> 19:44.880
If I find you're holding anything back
that effects this enquiry, I'll arrest you.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.630
Look, you have to promise not to
tell any of my family that I knew.

19:51.680 --> 19:55.670
Not if I can help it. That's the
only guarantee you're getting.

19:55.720 --> 20:01.390
When Finn came home, I picked up his phone
and it was a woman saying she was his wife.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.870
His wife?

20:02.920 --> 20:06.310
I asked him about it and
he said, "It was a mistake."

20:06.360 --> 20:09.350
He got married when he
was working in Glasgow

20:09.400 --> 20:12.750
and it was something he
just wanted to forget about.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.110
But he never said he had a kid.

20:15.160 --> 20:18.870
Do you think Finn told anyone
else about his marriage? Corina?

20:18.920 --> 20:23.400
I doubt it. He made me promise
never to mention it again.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.110
Thank you, we'll be in touch.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.590
That was Finn Thornberry's wife.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.430
Ex-wife?

20:32.480 --> 20:35.830
No, they're still married. He
hasn't seen her in four years.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.990
He walked out a few weeks
after his son was born.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.030
- The child in the photograph.
- Yeah, he cared enough to keep the picture

20:43.080 --> 20:46.470
Not enough to stick around after
clearing out their account.

20:46.520 --> 20:51.710
A month later, the unfortunate Mrs Thornberry
discovered he'd been misappropriating funds

20:51.760 --> 20:55.310
from the community housing
project they both worked for.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.350
Did you ask if there was
anyone with a grudge again Finn?

20:58.400 --> 21:03.590
- She didn't name anyone specifically
but reckons it could be a long
list. - She's probably right.

21:03.640 --> 21:10.230
This doesn't quite fit with Andrea's
claim that her son's only fault was
being a little over-confident.

21:10.280 --> 21:15.760
Let's find out whether Corina Craven knew
anything about her late fiance's past.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.990
That can't be right.

21:24.040 --> 21:29.110
Finn and I were getting married.
He was making the arrangements.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.840
Had he got very far with that?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.070
He'd been busy.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.660
Booked the church? Set the date?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.280
No, not yet.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.270
Did you make any attempt to find
out why he was delaying things?

21:47.320 --> 21:50.240
No, I just thought he was busy.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.350
I really trusted Finn.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.280
More fool me.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
Thank you.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.790
If you remember anything significant that
he might have mentioned about his past,

22:06.840 --> 22:08.840
please let us know.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.790
- You must have been very young
when the village was evacuated. - 12.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.270
They said we'd be allowed to
return at the end of the war

23:13.320 --> 23:16.230
but we were lied to and betrayed.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.270
Have you lived in Great Auburn ever since?

23:19.320 --> 23:23.110
I lived in London for a
while after my marriage

23:23.160 --> 23:27.350
but my husband died when Julian
was a baby and I came back.

23:27.400 --> 23:34.030
I understand you're campaigning to
restore Little Auburn exactly as it was.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.750
Had you been back there before today?

23:36.800 --> 23:42.680
No, but I've always known it was a vital
and precious part of our heritage.

23:43.720 --> 23:47.230
What was your relationship
like with your rival bidders?

23:47.280 --> 23:48.750
Civilised.

23:49.720 --> 23:54.400
- What was your opinion of Finn Thornberry?
- Full of the arrogance of youth.

23:56.280 --> 24:02.110
Do you have any influence with Roderick that
might make him look on your bid more favourably?

24:02.160 --> 24:06.870
I'm sure, Inspector, that you
will hear that I had a relationship

24:06.920 --> 24:09.870
with Roderick's father
Tobias before I was married

24:09.920 --> 24:15.600
but that does not put me in a
favourable position with Roderick.

24:17.640 --> 24:23.030
As one of the rival bids, I'm here to talk to you
about your relationship with Finn Thornberry.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.710
Oh, we've got no issue with him.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.110
Our bid's obviously the frontrunner.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.710
It's the best investment for Roderick.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.950
Last night, did you come
straight home after the party?

24:35.000 --> 24:38.040
Yes, we came back together.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.510
- Did you speak to Finn at all?
- No.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.350
Although there was something odd. When I
got home, I'd missed a voicemail from him.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.600
- Have you still got it?
- I should think so.

24:52.880 --> 24:56.560
- Why would Finn be calling you?
- I don't know.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.440
I tried to ring him back
but it didn't connect.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.670
"You have no new messages
and one saved message."

25:11.720 --> 25:14.830
"Lucy, it's Finn. Call me
back as soon as you can."

25:14.880 --> 25:18.240
- Any idea what that was about.
- No idea. He never phoned back.

25:19.240 --> 25:23.000
Why didn't you think to tell us this?

25:28.080 --> 25:30.110
Can I help you?

25:30.160 --> 25:34.520
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Barnaby, Causton CID. And you are?

25:35.520 --> 25:39.630
Julian Lennard. I hope my mother
has been her usual charming self.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.750
Little Auburn clearly
means a great deal to her.

25:42.800 --> 25:48.360
Her family lived there for
generations. Her father was the
last vicar. Her mother's buried there.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.880
What do you think should happen
to the village, Mr Lennard?

25:56.480 --> 26:00.110
I'm Roderick Craven's solicitor
so I'm staying strictly neutral.

26:00.160 --> 26:03.720
Well, you'd be a brave man to
go up against your own mother.

26:04.760 --> 26:09.070
As Mr Craven's solicitor, you must
be privy to his business affairs.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.790
Do you know which project
he's going to choose?

26:11.840 --> 26:16.360
I couldn't possibly divulge
my client's preference.

26:17.360 --> 26:19.150
I understand

26:19.200 --> 26:22.510
but if I find I can't get
this information elsewhere,

26:22.560 --> 26:24.900
I'll be back to talk to you.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.040
It was YOU, wasn't it?

26:31.280 --> 26:33.590
Are you accusing me of murder?

26:33.640 --> 26:37.470
- Don't make me laugh. You wouldn't
have the guts. - What, then?

26:37.520 --> 26:42.190
An application to have Little Auburn declared
a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

26:42.240 --> 26:47.230
- Got your eco-friendly fingerprints all over
it. - I have no idea what you're talking about.

26:47.280 --> 26:52.510
But if there is of rare plant or wildlife in
Little Auburn, I'm glad it's being protected!

26:52.560 --> 26:55.030
Father always said you were a waster!

26:55.080 --> 26:58.590
- You're a pathetic failure!
- Get out! - Dad! - Stop it!

26:58.640 --> 27:00.470
You two, stop arguing!

27:00.520 --> 27:04.510
My son's been killed and you're
behaving like school children.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.470
Can we please move on from this?

27:08.520 --> 27:11.510
You always think the worst of me.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.840
But it's not me that needs to move on.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.880
It's me. We're going to
have to be more careful.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.430
Any chance of a coffee, darling?

27:34.480 --> 27:37.120
- Sure.
- Thanks.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.720
Call you back.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.280
- Here.
- Thank you.

28:07.880 --> 28:12.270
- Did you and Dad fight when
you were kids? - All the time.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.320
I bet you always won.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.670
Have you thought any more who
you are going to sell to?

28:22.720 --> 28:27.710
It's just I've loved helping
Lucy and Blake design the plan.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.990
It's all going to be so exciting.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.310
'Dad!'

28:33.120 --> 28:35.030
In here.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.920
Hello, darling.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.350
- Sorry, am I interrupting something?
- Of course not.

28:43.400 --> 28:47.240
I've got stuff to do. See
you later, Uncle Rod.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.360
Corina.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.150
Go on, go.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.280
- No!
- Here, boy. There we go.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.270
I've come to tell you I'm not
gonna let our project die.

29:14.320 --> 29:18.750
Really? And who are you going to
be working with now Finn has gone?

29:18.800 --> 29:22.640
- I can lead the project
without him. - Hmn...

29:23.680 --> 29:28.030
Of course! It was too much to hope you
might believe in me for once in my life.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.380
- I never said anything.
- You didn't have to!

29:31.880 --> 29:35.510
All I'm asking is for an
opportunity to prove you wrong,

29:35.560 --> 29:38.240
to show you what I'm capable of.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.350
Good, boy.

29:48.680 --> 29:53.830
Can I show you this, sir? The search team
came across it abandoned in some bushes.

29:53.880 --> 29:58.190
It's new, less than six months old so
I doubt it was left over by the army.

29:58.240 --> 30:02.350
- Was it Finn and Corina's?
- Eco-warriors don't tend to use fossil fuels.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.150
They didn't have a vehicle and there
wasn't a generator at the squat.

30:06.200 --> 30:10.960
There is a serial number so I might be able
to find out when and where it was bought.

30:18.080 --> 30:22.910
If you were Roderick Craven, which of
the three proposals would you choose?

30:22.960 --> 30:27.950
If I was thinking about the money, I'd pick
the villas. They're offering the best price.

30:28.000 --> 30:32.670
But if I wanted to keep Corina on side and
do some good, I'd pick the eco-village.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.870
If you wanted a quiet life, you'd let
Sylvia Lennard have her living museum.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.910
What would you do?

30:38.960 --> 30:44.070
It would depend whether I wanted to get Finn
Thornberry out of my daughter's life or not.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.230
Have you found out anything
about Finn's finances?

30:47.280 --> 30:50.550
Several cash deposits made
over the last couple of months.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.920
Who would be paying regular cash to Finn?

30:57.480 --> 31:02.800
I have a feeling that this murder isn't just
about who wins the fight for Little Auburn.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.790
You know they belong to me.
Why are you hiding them?

31:08.840 --> 31:12.510
- That is an outrageous accusation.
- It is not an accusation.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.110
- I am asking a question.
- And I'm telling you you're deluded.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.870
You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?

31:18.920 --> 31:22.920
I had hoped that we could settle
this in a civilised fashion.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.600
But I will get what's mine.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.320
You'll see.

31:41.320 --> 31:45.390
Nothing to worry about. Everything's
heading in the right direction.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.590
- Are you sure?
- My charm will win it for us in the end.

31:48.640 --> 31:52.110
I can't argue with that. You
are quite charming, Lucy.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.670
Thank you.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.190
But we have to be careful.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.190
As an MP, I'm the one in the public eye.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.910
I think you're quite enjoying this.

32:02.440 --> 32:06.030
Besides, it will all be worth
it in the end, I promise.

32:06.080 --> 32:12.070
- And you're not doing anything
wrong. - People around here wouldn't
agree, my mother-in-law for a start!

32:12.120 --> 32:14.920
And certainly not Julian.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.070
How's Jamie coping with
his first country murder?

32:52.120 --> 32:54.110
With gusto.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.150
He's OK, then?

32:56.200 --> 32:59.790
- Better than the others?
- That's not setting the bar very high.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.550
- He talks too much.
- We must have him over for dinner.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.150
You haven't been listening to me.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.470
Yes, I have. You like him.

33:10.040 --> 33:16.430
While Betty was having her nap, I
dug out the latest news letter from
the Midsomer Historical Society.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.910
And joined Betty in peaceful slumber?

33:18.960 --> 33:24.190
There was a piece in it arguing that Little
Auburn should be preserved as a living museum.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.470
- Written by Sylvia Lennard
by any chance? - Very good!

33:27.520 --> 33:28.950
I'm a detective, you know.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.590
So then I rang Dr Granville,
my local historian friend,

33:32.640 --> 33:36.030
- to see if she knew anything
more about the place. - And?

33:36.080 --> 33:40.870
It's more gossip than history. She said the
Cravens were a rackety lot, by all accounts.

33:40.920 --> 33:46.110
Tobias Craven, who's the present generation's
father, was a terrible gambler and womaniser.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.070
Hmn, just like me, darling.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.120
In your dreams!

34:15.340 --> 34:16.610
Paddy!

34:17.199 --> 34:19.760
Paddy! Paddy!

34:22.679 --> 34:24.230
Stupid animal.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.670
Paddy!

34:25.719 --> 34:27.190
Paddy.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.909
Agh! Ugh!

34:28.960 --> 34:30.159
God!

34:45.560 --> 34:48.199
Hello. Police.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.469
I need to report something.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.030
He's been dead around 10 hours.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.870
There are signs of trauma to his head

35:06.920 --> 35:10.950
but I don't think that's what's
killed him. His flask was by his side.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.270
Tell me what you can smell.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.430
- Bitter almonds -- cyanide.
- Poisoned.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.190
And that's not everything.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.440
I've got something to
show you. Come with me.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.950
There are traces of blood on the body
as well as evidence he'd been dragged.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.990
Look over here -- traces of blood.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.190
It's a fox hole trench.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.950
My guess is the victim was
lured here and fell into it.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.510
- First the tank. Now a fox hole.
- It's as if the army never left.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.070
Thank you, Kam. Let me know
if you find anything else.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.640
I will do.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.920
Now let's find out what Fred Messenger
was doing here so early in the morning.

35:54.560 --> 35:59.110
- I woke up early. I fancied a walk.
- You know this is still private land.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.350
I grew up here.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.830
And I didn't get a good
look around yesterday.

36:04.880 --> 36:08.840
You lived here as a child
like Sylvia Lennard?

36:11.160 --> 36:15.630
My dad ran the pub. Her dad was the vicar.

36:15.680 --> 36:20.840
Sylvia wasn't allowed to
play with us village kids.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.790
Did you see anyone on your way here
this morning, walkers, cyclists?

36:26.840 --> 36:30.830
- Any vehicles on the road?
- It was barely light. It's nearly 10 o'clock.

36:30.880 --> 36:37.750
Everybody's going to be at my pub waiting
for Roderick to announce his decision.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.270
What do you think it was going to be?

36:40.320 --> 36:43.160
Well, we'll never know, will we?

36:50.160 --> 36:54.350
I hope Roderick isn't going
to leave us hanging around.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.070
- Maybe he's done a runner.
- Hasn't got the guts to face us.

36:58.120 --> 37:01.400
- Very likely!
- Hasn't got the guts to face you.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.310
No, Roderick wouldn't do that.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.900
- Are you OK?
- Not really, no.

37:09.120 --> 37:12.390
I don't suppose you are either.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.990
- I just want to get this over with.
- Oh, come on!

37:15.040 --> 37:18.030
- What's he playing at?!
- What's the rush?

37:18.080 --> 37:23.270
I don't like being kept waiting. I've spent
enough time, money and effort on this thing.

37:23.320 --> 37:28.760
It's all about to pay dividends. He's not going
to give it to Sylvia. Not in a million years.

37:29.800 --> 37:33.710
She's the reason Roderick
has to choose us.

37:33.760 --> 37:37.190
Or this place will be overrun by her type.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.910
Could we have a word in private, please?

37:52.960 --> 37:55.000
Shall we go outside?

37:56.000 --> 37:57.940
You stay here, Josh.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.390
I'm very sorry.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.390
Can you tell me when you last saw him?

38:26.440 --> 38:27.830
Erm...

38:27.880 --> 38:30.710
Yesterday evening. I went to his house.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.150
And you, Mr Craven?

38:32.200 --> 38:36.080
He came into my shop yesterday afternoon.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.710
What did you talk about,
anything that might help us?

38:40.760 --> 38:42.750
Nothing much.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.240
What time did you leave?

38:47.760 --> 38:51.310
I left when he went for his
usual evening walk with Paddy.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.600
Has anyone seen his dog?

38:54.600 --> 38:57.340
Don't worry, we'll look out for him.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.940
And how was he when he
left you, Mr Craven?

39:01.960 --> 39:04.750
I could lie. I could say that he was fine

39:04.800 --> 39:10.880
but it wouldn't take you long to work out
that our relationship wasn't that good.

39:11.880 --> 39:15.040
We had one of our usual
brotherly arguments.

39:16.160 --> 39:19.100
But he was perfectly OK when he left me.

39:23.080 --> 39:27.190
That's it, we're finished! There's
no way Corina's going to sell to us.

39:27.240 --> 39:31.310
- We don't know that for sure and even
if it is the case -- - What? Sorry, what?

39:31.360 --> 39:32.910
Enlighten me.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.750
Well, it's not the end of the world, Lucy.

39:35.800 --> 39:40.510
When I fell in love with you, you
weren't afraid of a challenge.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.870
I am not afraid of a challenge!

39:42.920 --> 39:44.510
Oh, good grief!

39:44.560 --> 39:48.150
Look, can we just cut our
losses and just leave, Lucy?

39:48.200 --> 39:52.950
- Please? - I need to do this for me. You
know I have to make a success of it this time.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.310
For goodness sake, I am just
trying to make you happy.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.280
He just doesn't get it, does he?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.630
Was Roderick Craven a
friend as well as a client?

40:33.680 --> 40:37.110
I'd say so, yes. We'd known
each other since childhood.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.950
I'd been his solicitor
for more than 20 years.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.630
- Did you draw up a will for him?
- Yeah.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.830
Quite a long time ago.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.990
May I see it, please?

40:47.040 --> 40:51.040
No, that wouldn't be right. His
family have yet to see it themselves.

40:52.840 --> 40:56.150
Are they familiar with its
provisions, do you know?

40:56.200 --> 41:02.590
I'm afraid I don't know what Roderick
did or didn't discuss with his family.

41:02.640 --> 41:07.390
- The will, please, Mr Lennard.
- I've already explained that's not possible.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.910
We can get a warrant, you know.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.760
If you put it that way...

41:23.780 --> 41:26.390
He left Little Auburn to me?!

41:26.440 --> 41:28.590
Why would he do that?

41:28.640 --> 41:30.230
Does it matter?

41:30.280 --> 41:33.350
You had no inkling that your
brother was planning this?

41:33.400 --> 41:35.750
Well, as you know, we
didn't exactly get on.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.600
And why was that?

41:38.080 --> 41:39.270
That was my fault!

41:39.320 --> 41:43.470
Milo and I got married and his
father cut him out of the will.

41:43.520 --> 41:48.550
I mean, Roderick could have shared the
inheritance when the old man died but he didn't.

41:48.600 --> 41:54.520
Forgive my asking but what did
Mr Craven Senior have against you?

41:55.560 --> 41:57.790
Cravens don't marry barmaids.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.780
Not even when they've got them pregnant.

42:02.160 --> 42:06.350
That seems a rather old-fashioned
attitude even for 25 years ago.

42:06.400 --> 42:12.190
Tobias was old-school. Had half
the women in Great Auburn in his
day but kept the bloodline pure.

42:12.240 --> 42:16.270
Perhaps leaving Little Auburn to Milo
was Roderick's way of making amends.

42:16.320 --> 42:21.070
- But what will Corina get? - She will get
the house at Great Auburn and everything else.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.990
If there is anything else.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.980
All the Cravens are hopeless with money.

42:27.880 --> 42:32.360
The grandfather used to own a racing
stables. Lost the whole lot in a single bet.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.870
Looks like Blake's about
to send out a search party.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.590
I'd better go.

42:52.960 --> 42:57.520
I am so looking forward to
when it's just the two of us.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.430
You've got five seconds to explain what
you're doing here before I call the police.

44:36.480 --> 44:40.470
- How did you get here?
- Through the back door which I found unlocked.

44:40.520 --> 44:43.030
- How did you?
- With Corina's keys.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.150
Corina sent you?

44:45.200 --> 44:47.680
Not exactly.

44:48.960 --> 44:52.360
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.030
Please don't do that.

44:56.080 --> 44:59.880
I'm calling them unless you
tell me what you're doing here.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.040
You have five more seconds.

45:06.160 --> 45:10.320
It might take a bit longer than that.

45:12.840 --> 45:17.070
Remember when they took us to watch a
post mortem and the Scottish guy fainted?

45:17.120 --> 45:22.590
- You and I had to take him outside.
- Then you suggested we go for sushi
and he nearly fainted again.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.470
Didn't know what he was missing.

45:24.520 --> 45:29.230
Is there anywhere in Causton that does good
sushi? I usually make my own packed lunch...

45:29.280 --> 45:34.070
Words can hardly express how uninterested
I am in your nutritional arrangements.

45:34.120 --> 45:38.270
What I am interested in is the
test results from that flask.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.840
It was cyanide but clear for
DNA and prints, I'm afraid.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.110
What about the markings?

45:45.160 --> 45:48.150
Possibly military.
Probably 30-40 years old.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.630
So, when the MOD still had the village?

45:50.680 --> 45:55.430
OK, so we should keep following up any
military connections to our suspects.

45:55.480 --> 46:00.070
But why would the killer use a flask
that led us to that conclusion?

46:00.120 --> 46:04.990
- It's too staged. - I'm on it, sir. - There
was another thing that I thought odd. - What?

46:05.040 --> 46:10.910
There were loose hairs on Roderick
Craven's head and body as though
someone had been pulling it out.

46:10.960 --> 46:15.800
- Why would someone pull out his
hair? Torture? DNA? - A love token.

46:20.600 --> 46:25.470
Maybe we can scale back on these terraces.
This stone is pushing us way over budget.

46:25.520 --> 46:31.030
Lucy said to use the best materials.
I'm not sure if we can achieve the
same effect if we go cheaper.

46:31.080 --> 46:36.200
- It's naturally sourced in India. - We need
to talk about how to deal with Milo Craven.

46:37.200 --> 46:41.640
Darling, little inappropriate
under the circumstances.

46:45.560 --> 46:48.870
I'm sorry, Dottie, about Roderick.

46:48.920 --> 46:54.910
I can't believe your father's going
to let the eco-village happen after
all the hard work we've put in.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.550
I still want it just as much as you.

46:57.600 --> 47:01.880
Well, I think we need to make your
father an offer he can't refuse.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.880
Tea?

47:05.880 --> 47:08.280
Did you have a figure in mind?

47:09.080 --> 47:10.630
No.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.110
Didn't think so.

47:12.160 --> 47:16.000
Because we don't have
unlimited funds, darling.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.870
Most of which came and
continue to come from me

47:20.920 --> 47:24.630
- so this is a decision that we need
to make together. - We're a team.

47:24.680 --> 47:27.070
I need you. You need me.

47:27.120 --> 47:30.840
You know how good I am at getting
people to do what I want.

47:32.920 --> 47:38.110
- Milo, if we sell, we can stop flogging
this dead horse for a start. - Dead horse?

47:38.160 --> 47:44.040
- Something good has got to come of this.
- Maybe you can give up your cleaning jobs now.

47:46.760 --> 47:50.320
I can't believe it. Poor Uncle Rod.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.320
I know, love.

47:55.360 --> 47:56.920
Come on.

47:57.920 --> 48:02.390
The last time I saw him he said he
regretted how things ended up between you.

48:02.440 --> 48:05.640
I told him to tell you
but he said he couldn't.

48:07.080 --> 48:12.470
The night before he died he told me he was
going to go with our luxury villas project

48:12.520 --> 48:15.920
but that'd only make
matters worse between you.

48:17.040 --> 48:22.080
I suppose the eco-village
will go ahead now.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.430
We haven't got that far, to be honest.

48:27.480 --> 48:30.270
I'm sure it's the last thing on your mind.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.820
I just thought that you
should know what he said.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.870
- Just in case --
- Just in case, what?

48:37.440 --> 48:42.510
This isn't about what Roderick
wanted. It's about what Lucy wants.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.630
- That is not fair!
- Isn't it?

48:44.680 --> 48:49.670
Ever since you started hanging around with
your new friends, you've barely spoken to us

48:49.720 --> 48:52.590
and now, all of a sudden, here you are!

49:03.560 --> 49:07.550
Lucy, there's nothing I can
do. It's out of my hands.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.830
You see, I don't believe
that. Not for a second.

49:10.880 --> 49:15.550
There's a world of difference between putting
pressure on a local planning committee

49:15.600 --> 49:18.070
and going further up the chain.

49:21.760 --> 49:25.030
It upsets me when you
underestimate yourself like this.

49:25.080 --> 49:28.550
I think you are a lot smarter
than you give yourself credit for.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.030
- You're being ridiculous.
- I don't think so.

49:31.080 --> 49:34.350
I'm sure you're going to come
up with something brilliant.

49:34.400 --> 49:38.320
I think that would be for
the best for both of us.

49:45.320 --> 49:47.310
No joy with the jerry can.

49:47.360 --> 49:51.990
I've got the camping shop in Aspern Tallow
trawling through their customer records

49:52.040 --> 49:55.230
although I don't hold out much
hope for their filing system.

49:55.280 --> 50:00.190
Let's concentrate on the information we
do have, see who we still have in play.

50:00.240 --> 50:05.240
- Who do you suppose are the only
two people on that board with a
criminal record? - Surprise me.

50:06.240 --> 50:09.030
Fred Messenger and Sylvia Lennard.

50:09.080 --> 50:13.070
In 1962, a group of locals
invaded Little Auburn

50:13.120 --> 50:16.910
in protest against the army's
continued occupation of the village.

50:16.960 --> 50:21.750
They stayed a couple of days and then
were arrested, fined and bound over.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.270
Interesting.

50:23.320 --> 50:27.910
I wonder why Sylvia told me she hadn't been
back to Little Auburn since she was a child.

50:27.960 --> 50:33.120
I don't remember there being any
record of this invasion in her museum.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.110
What?

50:47.200 --> 50:50.590
What do you mean you can't
do anything about it?

50:50.640 --> 50:53.630
Why should Milo choose what
happens to Little Auburn?

50:53.680 --> 50:57.270
Sylvia, MPs aren't elected
to challenge people's wills.

50:57.320 --> 51:00.310
Milo was his brother.
He owns the land now.

51:00.360 --> 51:04.800
Looks like you have someone more
important than me to talk to. Excuse me.

51:07.160 --> 51:08.550
Inspector.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.200
Mrs Lennard.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.360
- Mrs Lennard.
- Yes.

51:17.960 --> 51:23.590
You were part of a group that broke
into Little Auburn in 1962, weren't you?

51:23.640 --> 51:25.310
What of it?

51:25.360 --> 51:27.590
That event isn't in your museum, is it?

51:27.640 --> 51:29.880
Not worth mentioning.

51:32.480 --> 51:36.800
We pitched camp in Little
Auburn for a few days.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.870
We got turfed out. Achieved nothing.

51:40.920 --> 51:43.030
Accept to earn you a criminal record.

51:43.080 --> 51:46.160
I suppose that's an achievement of sorts.

51:47.160 --> 51:50.660
And Fred Messenger was
there with you, wasn't he?

51:50.960 --> 51:54.350
I can't remember who was
there. It was a long time ago.

51:54.400 --> 51:58.750
Mrs Lennard, I'd hate to think you were
obstructing a murder investigation.

51:58.800 --> 52:02.950
- Is there anything else I should know?
- I'm not the criminal here!

52:03.000 --> 52:07.230
It's Fred who was snooping round
Roderick's place after he died.

52:07.280 --> 52:10.630
- What was he doing there?
- How should I know?!

52:10.680 --> 52:13.320
You're the detective. Do your job.

52:34.560 --> 52:36.470
It's so peaceful here.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.910
I can't believe this is all ours.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.700
- Quite something, isn't it?
- Yes.

52:42.640 --> 52:45.920
After all we've been
through, all we've lost...

52:51.460 --> 52:52.490
Did you hear that?

52:52.540 --> 52:54.080
Over there.

52:54.560 --> 52:55.920
Josh!

53:03.760 --> 53:06.500
What's happened, Josh? What's wrong?

53:06.720 --> 53:09.080
He's burning up.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.500
Fred Messenger.

53:23.760 --> 53:27.760
Auburn's finest. How can I help?

53:28.800 --> 53:32.790
It must be good news that your
son-in-law now owns Little Auburn.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.590
I suppose so.

53:34.640 --> 53:36.310
Bit of a surprise.

53:36.360 --> 53:40.240
Let's hope Milo can
prove himself for once.

53:41.280 --> 53:44.480
The village means a lot
to you, I'm guessing.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.400
Oh, go on. Spit it out.

53:52.200 --> 53:57.550
You were involved in a protest to
take back Little Auburn in 1962.

53:57.600 --> 54:00.870
Sylvia Lennard was also
a part of that protest.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.070
When I spoke to her earlier,

54:03.120 --> 54:07.110
she informed me that she found you
in Roderick's house this morning.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.880
Is it true?

54:09.880 --> 54:11.270
Yes.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.310
I was there.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.000
Corina asked me to find her dad's dog.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.990
In the study?

54:20.040 --> 54:24.070
Oh, you can't believe
everything Sylvia Lennard says.

54:24.120 --> 54:27.310
She knew exactly why I was there

54:27.360 --> 54:30.750
but she didn't want you to know

54:30.800 --> 54:35.510
that my family still own
the pub in Little Auburn.

54:35.560 --> 54:39.990
It was won in a poker
game by my grandfather

54:40.040 --> 54:45.280
and the deeds have conveniently been
missing since the village was taken.

54:46.560 --> 54:49.950
- And did you find them?
- No.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.790
But I will

54:51.840 --> 54:54.270
and whatever plans Milo has

54:54.320 --> 54:58.040
will have to involve me.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.190
Ooh!

55:04.240 --> 55:06.870
Oh, sweetheart!

55:06.920 --> 55:10.070
It looks really nasty.

55:10.120 --> 55:13.310
We must get you checked out by a doctor.

55:13.360 --> 55:16.790
I told you, Mum, I'm feeling better now.

55:16.840 --> 55:19.780
- I couldn't find any painkillers. - OK.

55:20.360 --> 55:23.800
When I get back, I want you to tell
me why you were in the village.

55:37.360 --> 55:41.830
- You haven't told her anything, have you?
- No, Dad, but you need to get back there.

55:41.880 --> 55:45.230
- You must get to them now.
One has got loose. - Loose?

55:45.280 --> 55:47.720
For God's sake, Josh!

55:57.600 --> 56:00.390
- Thank you, Mrs Lennard.
- Thank you for your support.

56:00.440 --> 56:03.990
Would you drop one of those off
at the Emporium on your way home?

56:04.040 --> 56:07.710
Are you trying to persuade Milo?
I'm not sure a leaflet will do it.

56:07.760 --> 56:11.110
Since when have you
been a quitter, Julian?

56:11.160 --> 56:13.270
I don't want you to be disappointed.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.990
My whole life is a disappointment!

56:16.040 --> 56:18.840
You couldn't help yourself, could you?

56:21.200 --> 56:26.030
Can you just move along? Stop making
the front of my store look unsightly.

56:26.080 --> 56:31.280
I might have known you couldn't resist
the temptation to set the police on me.

56:32.280 --> 56:34.350
But it backfired.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.630
I told them I was looking for the deeds.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.560
- I was trying to be fair.
- Fair?

56:41.600 --> 56:46.190
You can't move me aside to
preserve your old relics.

56:46.240 --> 56:51.070
- And Milo will do the right thing.
- By destroying the village?

56:51.120 --> 56:53.230
Our past.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.070
Move on!

56:55.120 --> 56:58.390
- You're becoming an old relic
yourself, Sylvia. - Steady on.

56:58.440 --> 57:01.560
You've had your say. Now
just leave Mummy alone.

57:11.800 --> 57:16.350
I, er, take it he didn't find
anything at Roderick's house?

57:16.400 --> 57:18.940
Not when I was there, certainly.

57:19.600 --> 57:21.870
I saw him off the premises.

57:23.200 --> 57:26.140
So it sounds like wishful thinking, then.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.270
.. for one bathroom. That will do.

57:35.320 --> 57:36.830
Thank you.

57:36.880 --> 57:40.750
I bet you know where
Roderick's put the deeds.

57:40.800 --> 57:44.470
- Are you asking me to be indiscreet?
- What have you got to lose?

57:44.520 --> 57:48.710
And I won't tell your mummy if that helps.

57:48.760 --> 57:50.680
Nice try.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.840
- You look like you need
one of those. - Thanks.

57:56.880 --> 58:00.270
I've just had Fred Messenger
trying to put pressure on me.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.310
I know that feeling.

58:02.360 --> 58:07.950
Milo! But your daughter, quite
rightly, believes our bid is the best.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.770
No, you need to seriously
consider our offer.

58:12.320 --> 58:15.600
We can improve it if that would help?

58:16.600 --> 58:17.960
Please?

58:22.640 --> 58:26.340
So that's the bathroom of
one of the two-bed flats.

58:26.480 --> 58:30.030
- Who was that? - It
was just Milo. - Really?

58:30.080 --> 58:31.470
Yes.

58:31.520 --> 58:36.510
I really tried to talk to Dad but he wasn't
in the mood for talking about the village.

58:36.560 --> 58:39.230
I gathered. Honestly, you're hopeless!

58:39.280 --> 58:43.400
Don't you want us to win? Maybe try
again when he's had a few drinks.

58:46.520 --> 58:49.920
Going to go and powder my nose,
Blake. Large G and T for me.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.000
See you later.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.240
Hello, you.

59:46.600 --> 59:49.200
- Is Lucy in there?
- Sorry, no.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.120
Lucy, it's me.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.440
Where are you?

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.980
How are you feeling?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.110
- I hope you're not in any trouble. - Honestly,
Mum, it's nothing. I was just being stupid.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.680
I wanted to check out the village and
fell over. It must have been a branch.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.390
Is Milo about?

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.870
Erm, no, he's not at the
moment. Is something wrong?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.620
Tell him I need to speak
to him and it's important.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.750
- What was all that about?
- I don't know.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.190
Where is your dad?

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.070
Josh!

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.910
- Blake Keswick was the only one in the village
with an army background? - Still checking.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:04.550
He was the first one that came up. The interesting
bit is he was stationed at Little Auburn.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.550
He left 20 years ago.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.150
I found a report from his then
commanding officer, Major Haynes.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:15.230
Blake Keswick was discharged
for attacking a senior officer.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.150
- Do we know who that was?
- The man himself.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.950
Haynes received a nasty punch after Keswick
accused him of sleeping with his girlfriend.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.150
Haynes denies it and no-one
backs up Keswick's story.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.030
So, what have we got? Two murders
connected to the military in some way.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.350
Coincidence?

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.910
Or someone trying to point
the finger at Blake?

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.790
- He sounds aggressive and unpredictable.
- I'm sure you can handle him.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.240
Let's see what he has to say.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.830
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.670
- I'm just meeting a supplier.
- "Don't lie. You're a terrible liar."

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.710
What's going on? Where are you?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.550
I've had Blake in here looking for you.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.470
- "I'm in the old village. Something's
come up." - "What do you mean?"

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.660
What are you doing here?

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.070
Milo!

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.880
"Milo?"

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.540
"Milo!"

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.920
OK, Josh, you need to tell
me exactly where your dad is.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.110
What, Little Auburn?

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.270
Do we know exactly where he is? ... OK.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.470
- Mr Keswick, we need to talk.
- Change of plan.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.350
- Andrew Craven thinks her husband
is in danger. - Whereabouts?

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.870
- Sir?
- Hmn?

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.320
Perhaps we should...

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.230
It's an old sign. Come on.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440
Sir.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.510
Sir, stay right where you are.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.500
You've got company.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.000
Get out, Winter.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.640
Got you!

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.110
Nicely done, Winter.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.830
Even if you were disobeying orders.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.440
I think we need to see what's
behind this door, don't you?

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.470
It's like a sauna in here.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.960
Sir.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.790
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Craven.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.670
What was he thinking, getting
involved in something like that?

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.590
Do you know, Josh?

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.710
It's my fault.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.590
What do you mean?

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.870
I read about how much
money exotic snakes go for.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:30.240
I told Dad and we came up with an
idea of breeding them in the village.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.630
- Oh, Josh!
- One got loose and bit me on my arm.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.990
I let the wound get infected.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.710
Dad didn't want me to say anything.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.710
- Who did this?
- That's what we're trying to establish.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:48.950
Is there anyone who'd clashed
with your husband recently.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.310
No. Apart from Roderick.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.630
Everyone was trying to get him
to talk to them about the village.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.710
Sylvia. Lucy.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.070
And then Blake Keswick
came round asking for him.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.190
Thank you.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.800
If you remember anything
else, please let us know.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.320
I'm sorry.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.310
She's asleep. Took her a while to go down.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:29.680
She's still asking exactly where Sykes is.

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.350
How did your seminar go?

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:34.910
Oh, fine.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.670
I am now fully compliant with
staff performance review protocols.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.310
Lucky you!

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:44.720
Maybe we should get Betty a rabbit
or something to distract her.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.710
For five minutes.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.550
I'll spend more time cleaning the cage out

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.029
- than she will playing with Flopsy.
- You're probably right.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.760
It's too soon.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.550
How's the case going?
Anything I can help you with?

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.149
Only if you know something I
don't about any of the suspects,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.590
like Lucy or Blake Keswick or local
MP Sujan Lennard for instance.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:16.319
Wasn't she the one that had a female partner
then suddenly married a male solicitor?

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.279
You spend too much time
reading online gossip.

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:24.479
And I'm glad that you do.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.830
You know how to keep me on my toes.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.029
This is the first time I've encountered
snake constriction as a method of killing.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.069
- No two days are the same in this
job. - The ultimate cause of death
is restriction of blood supply.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.950
The victim suffered a sharp blow to
the head rendering him unconscious.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.910
So that's how the killer got him
locked in the deadly room of serpents.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.310
- Is that what we're calling it?
- Absolutely not.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.030
There are grazes to his legs
and bruises under his arms

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.990
- consistent with having been
pulled into the... - Please don't.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.670
.. crime scene.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:11.710
The snakes would then have squeezed
his body, cutting off his blood flow.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.950
- His major organs would have
shut down under the pressure.
- What a deeply unpleasant way to go.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
- When you examined the victim's
head wound, did you notice any...?
- No sign of any hair missing. Sorry.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.630
That village must be cursed. First
one owner dies, then the next.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:34.070
Under the terms of Milo's will,
Little Auburn now passes to Andrea.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.910
- Shall I get Uniform to
keep an eye on her? - Um.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:41.070
Finn was squatting in Little
Auburn but he didn't own it.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.190
So if this is the same killer,

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.230
there must be something else
that connects the three deaths.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.120
But what?

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.510
If can't be Andrea? She rang
us about Milo going missing.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.470
The perfect cover.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.510
Let's not rule anyone out.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.950
She's very close to her father
and he wants the old pub back

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.240
but she surely wouldn't
have killed her own son.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:11.110
Anything come back from the bank about who
was making cash payments into Finn's account?

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.630
- You think we should
follow the money? - Always.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.360
In fact, let's have a look at all our
suspects' financial ins and outs.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.280
Oh, and it's time to go
and see Blake Keswick.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.950
I didn't mention it because I didn't
think it was relevant. It was years ago.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.430
You didn't think it was relevant
that you were second in command
of an army unit in Little Auburn?

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.670
The place wasn't used
very much by that stage

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.070
and so it was where the army
sent its most hopeless officers.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.790
- Did you know Roderick Craven back then
or any member of the Craven family? - No.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.830
What about the circumstances in
which you left the army, Mr Keswick?

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.440
- Do you think those are
irrelevant too? - Entirely.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.510
It was a fight, that's all.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.150
- You put the other man in hospital.
- Briefly.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:09.630
- And got a dishonourable discharge.
- Only because the other man happened
to be my commanding officer.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.720
It was 20 years ago!

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.880
We'll be in touch.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.510
Someone's gone through the bank
statements and they have found something.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.790
- About who?
- Andrea Craven.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.030
Her account is regularly
topped up with small cash sums

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.800
- but, also, she deposits a lot of cheques.
- Well, she runs a shop.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.910
No, this is her personal account.
Most of the cheques come from other
Great Auburn residents -- £30, £50.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.860
She's a cleaner. They are
payments from her customers.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.310
Of course. Sorry, I thought
it might have been something.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.670
Maybe it still is.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.910
It's mainly private homes. It looks like she
does a bit of office cleaning for Julian Lennard.

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.790
- That cheque comes from his company account.
- That is interesting.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.870
Find out how often she
cleans his office and when.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.360
Yes, sir.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.920
So, you've been lying to me all this time?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.550
Why?

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.750
I didn't tell you about Little
Auburn because it was too painful.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.390
What's your excuse?

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.920
Excuse for what? Lying to me.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.710
I don't know what you mean.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.350
Let me give you a little
piece of advice, Lucy.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.590
If you are going to go to the
trouble of acquiring a secret phone,

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.760
do not use your date of
birth as your password!

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.350
No, that's all I needed.
That's really useful.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:49.790
According to Julian Lennard's office manager,
Andrea has been cleaning for them for three years.

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.350
- Long enough to trust her with
the keys and alarm code. - Right.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.230
- She goes in after the office
is closed. - Three years?

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.270
So she would have been there when
the MOD announced they were handing
the land back to Roderick Craven.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.030
- What are you thinking, sir?
- Julian Lennard was Roderick Craven's solicitor

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.070
- so he had his will at the office.
- Easy for Andrea to access. - Possibly.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:17.710
Perhaps she forged it. Remember how
shocked everyone was that Roderick
left his estate to his brother.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.040
Let's get Forensics to
take a look at that will.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.030
- Lucy? - Is Julian here? - No.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.510
- You shouldn't be here.
- It's Blake. I think he's going to hurt Julian.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.300
What the hell are you talking about?

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.910
Sir. There's something here
I think you should see.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.550
Those deposits made into Finn's account
-- one was made via an ATM in Oxford.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.900
The bank just sent through
their CCTV footage.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.190
- Lucy, what's going on?
- We're having an affair and Blake's found out.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.750
- I wouldn't call it that. - Julian and
I. Julian and I were having an affair.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:09.150
- Don't look like that. Your
marriage was over. - How could you?!

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.590
- After everything I've done for you?!
- Everything you've done?

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:16.830
- All you did was sweet-talk a
planning committee. - All I did?

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.390
Something that goes against
everything I believe in.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:25.590
- So, why did you do it, then? - Because
I thought there was something between us.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.240
- We haven't got time for this. We need
to call the police. - No! Come back, Lucy!

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.520
What on earth's going on?

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.790
- Leave me alone!
- What's happening?

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.640
- Whoa! - You have to help me! My husband's
about to do something terrible to someone!

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.040
Agh!

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.120
No, no, no.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.500
Mother.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.950
- Will you talk? - I've had enough of listening
to you and everybody else in this town!

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.510
- All you ever do is talk!
- If I could just make you understand.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.230
- It's too late for that!
- Agh!

01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:57.830
No, please!

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.390
No, no!

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.280
Thought you could get
away with it, did you?

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.770
Move! I've got you now.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.070
No!

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.750
- Mummy? - Put that gun down. What
do you think you're doing? - Move!

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.990
Move over there now! Quickly move!

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.640
- Keep out of my way. This is
between me and Julian. - No, please.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.960
Your son has been having
an affair with my wife.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.910
- That can't be true.
- Are you accusing me of lying?

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.590
- Leave her alone!
- STOP TALKING!

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.990
I don't want to hear any
more from any of you!

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.110
- Including me?
- Huh?

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.430
You're an intelligent man, Mr Keswick.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.910
I don't have to tell you
this won't solve anything.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.030
It might make me feel better.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.230
Not for long.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.480
And not in a prison cell.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.780
Don't move!

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.030
I never asked her for anything!

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.200
Only to be with me. Only me!

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.790
You can't force someone into loving you.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.190
- Agh! - Drop it. - Agh!

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.240
Come here.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.820
Stay still.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.270
- Blake Keswick, I'm arresting you --
- I'll get you!

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.620
Come on, now, Ma.
Everything's going to be OK.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.350
I'm not sure that's the case, Mr Lennard.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.870
We still have some unsolved murders.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.550
Well, you've got him now, the killer.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.430
If only it were that simple.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.870
Maybe you could help me
to clear up a few things.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.230
For instance, why were you paying
large sums of money to Finn Thornberry?

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.670
He was doing some work for me,

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.550
erm, sorting out some planning
issues for Little Auburn.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.390
Ah!

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.750
Yet, you didn't want those
payments to be traceable.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.070
So you travelled 30 miles
just to make a deposit.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.670
We have you on CCTV in Oxford.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.000
Why?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.590
I don't recall.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.840
What exactly are you accusing my son of?

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.200
What was Finn really doing
for you, Mr Lennard?

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.790
Julian, why aren't you answering him?

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:33.830
As Corina's boyfriend, Finn had
access to Roderick Craven's house.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.760
What did you need him to get for you?

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.030
Not documents. You already
had access to those.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.240
Something more personal?

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.710
What did you do to my grandson?

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.870
Your grandson was just a little petty
thief and not a very good one either.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:58.590
Finn was supposed to be getting you some
DNA evidence to prove your real parentage.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.030
What?

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.710
- But he refused. - He had no intention
of building a damn eco-village.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.310
He was just going to take all
the investment money and run.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.200
- So, you were performing your civic
duty, protecting the village? - Yes!

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.110
You killed Finn because
he was blackmailing you.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.590
He knew what you intended to do.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.270
You then tried to throw
suspicion onto Blake Keswick.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.920
Julian, tell me this isn't true.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.910
Mr Lennard, how old were you
when you first became aware

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.670
that your mother had been in a relationship
with Tobias Craven, Roderick and Milo's father?

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.230
- Why is this relevant?
- You know why, Mother.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.790
Being Roderick's solicitor, you had
the opportunity to alter his will

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.680
leaving this village to
any surviving sibling.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.280
Then you killed Roderick.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.910
Once you got Milo out of the way as well,

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.990
it was just a case of
producing your DNA results

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.280
and staking your claim as the
rightful heir to Little Auburn.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.510
Julian, you're not the heir.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.160
- What? - Yes, I had
an affair with Tobias.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:20.390
- He wasn't your father.
- Why are you denying this?

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.550
The whole village knew!

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.590
I had to live with the shame
and teasing all my life.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.590
I know who I am!

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.390
Our officers searched your computer and
found you'd forged Roderick's will.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:38.280
They also found you're awaiting confirmation
of a DNA test which we tracked down.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:47.470
There was no match between the
two DNA samples that you provided.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.110
Yours and Roderick's.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.480
Tobias Craven was not your father.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.840
No, no, no, this is a mistake!

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.630
Who is my father?

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.150
And don't, for God's sake, give me that
line about him dying after I was born.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.800
Tell me the truth!

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.100
Here is your father.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.910
It was a long time ago.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:26.270
The invasion of Little Auburn in 1962.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.800
- No! - It can be a heady mix, civil
disobedience and cider around the camp fire.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.270
How could you keep this from me?

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.070
It's not true! You're lying!

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120
I'm so sorry.

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.340
Can you ever forgive me?

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.760
Never!

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:57.950
I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murders
of Finn Thornberry, Roderick and Milo Craven.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.230
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:05.480
if you do not mention, when questioned,
something you later rely on in court.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.140
Mother!

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.320
I'm sorry.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.390
For doing your job?

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:39.160
No, for the way I had to do it.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.680
Julian was right. I should
have told him the truth.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.120
But I was ashamed...

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.560
.. for all the wrong reasons.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.800
I'd never really spoke
to Fred before that night.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.160
He was funny...

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.160
.. and exciting.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.440
And one thing led to another, as it does.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:30.000
Then when I discovered I was in trouble...
That's what we called it in those days.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.800
I should never have come back.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.200
Somehow I couldn't keep away.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.000
- Had Fred never wondered
about Julian? - Oh, yes.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.960
But there was a rumour about Tobias and...

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.080
.. Fred stopped asking.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.270
It's all my fault, isn't it?

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.360
No, Mrs Lennard.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.950
You are responsible for your actions

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.070
but not for your son's.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.020
Let me find someone to take you home.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.280
Thank you.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.760
I prefer to walk.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.950
- Where did you find him? - Paddy went disappeared
in Little Auburn when his master was killed.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.270
Kam and I went back this morning with a
bit of filet mignon and he came running.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.720
Clearly a dog with good taste.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:20.920
Goodbye, Nelson, and good luck.

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.670
Paddy, down, boy.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.260
Sorry, sir.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.030
Better see if any of the
Cravens will take him in.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.550
I've tried, sir. The daughter's allergic
to dogs and the niece doesn't have space.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.790
- So, what are you planning to do?
- Well, I...

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:44.680
I'd take him myself but I don't
even know if I'm staying here.

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:49.440
Nelson's attachment has been
extended for at least another year.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.840
The job's yours if you want it.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.870
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, Jamie.

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.510
Thank you.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.990
Well done.

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.510
So you can start looking for some digs.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.110
Well, it's gonna take me
some time to find somewhere.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.550
I did mention that you and
Sarah recently suffered a loss.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.750
So I was wondering if you
might look after Paddy.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.790
Just for a few days.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.000
By, "A few days", I take
it you mean, "Forever"?

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.240
Well...

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.030
Hello, boy.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.880
Hiya.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.360
Thank you, Winter.
