01:21.455 --> 01:24.270
You are now qualified
for evangelical work...

01:24.335 --> 01:28.230
under the auspices of the Belgian
Committee of the Messengers of the Faith.

01:28.591 --> 01:31.974
May the Lord guide you
and sustain you in all your ways.

01:56.239 --> 01:59.469
Congratulations, Dr. Bosman.
A very creditable group of young men.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.740
Now about this
other young man, Dr. Bosman.

02:01.808 --> 02:03.880
Are you sure he's quite hopeless?

02:03.951 --> 02:07.431
Gentlemen, I've trained a great
many students in evangelical work...

02:07.503 --> 02:10.405
but never in my life
have I come across a case quite like this.

02:10.479 --> 02:13.097
He is completely unable
to speak extemporary.

02:13.232 --> 02:16.647
He prepares long and obscure sermons
which he's unable to memorize...

02:16.720 --> 02:20.102
and has to read
like a stumbling and inarticulate child.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.367
Now, gentlemen, can we send
that kind of man out into the field...

02:23.440 --> 02:25.349
to represent our society?

02:25.423 --> 02:28.009
Dr. Peeters, I think that's conclusive.

02:29.071 --> 02:31.657
Dr. Bosman, ask him to come in, please.

02:44.463 --> 02:48.260
Mr. Van Gogh, we have Dr. Bosman's
report on your progress here.

02:48.527 --> 02:50.829
- In view of what he's told us...
- You understand...

02:50.895 --> 02:53.448
if your teacher feels
that you're unqualified...

02:53.519 --> 02:55.853
this committee cannot give you
an appointment.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.676
We regret it more than we can say.

02:57.744 --> 03:01.039
Gentlemen, I think that concludes
Committee business for today.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.847
Mr. Van Gogh, do you feel that the
Committee were unjust in their decision?

03:16.783 --> 03:18.856
- No, sir.
- We did what we had to do...

03:18.927 --> 03:20.520
in view of your records.

03:21.392 --> 03:23.115
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.316
Your father is a minister, is he not?

03:30.384 --> 03:33.034
I'm not trying to put myself
on a level with my father.

03:33.103 --> 03:36.965
I only hoped in some way
to follow in his footsteps.

03:37.039 --> 03:38.381
Yet, until a year ago...

03:38.447 --> 03:42.157
you showed no inclination or desire
to follow your father's calling.

03:42.223 --> 03:46.249
Believe me, this is something I have to do.
I want to help the unfortunates.

03:46.319 --> 03:48.490
I want to bring them the word of God.

03:48.719 --> 03:51.567
Even if I'm not qualified,
there must be some way I can serve.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.501
Isn't there any place for me?
Somewhere no one else wants to go?

03:54.575 --> 03:57.194
I'll do anything. Only use me. Use me!

04:02.831 --> 04:04.107
Come here.

04:08.688 --> 04:11.055
- Do you know this part of the country?
- No.

04:11.183 --> 04:13.998
It's a coal-mining region, the Borinage.

04:14.127 --> 04:17.541
There exist no more miserable people
on the face of the earth...

04:17.615 --> 04:19.851
than the miners who live there.

04:20.208 --> 04:24.004
If you really mean what you said
about wanting to help the unfortunates...

04:24.079 --> 04:25.192
here's your chance.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.918
"The heart that seeks God...

04:48.271 --> 04:51.337
"has more storms than any others.

04:51.536 --> 04:53.772
"Life is a struggle here below.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.443
"Yet out of our sufferings...

04:57.744 --> 05:00.078
"God teaches us higher things.

05:00.687 --> 05:02.029
"He wills..."

05:05.711 --> 05:08.678
"He wills that man should live humbly...

05:09.807 --> 05:13.582
"and go through life
not reaching after lofty aims...

05:13.871 --> 05:17.995
"but fitting himself to the lowly
and learning from the Gospels...

05:18.799 --> 05:21.865
"to be meek, simple of heart."

05:33.295 --> 05:36.710
Father, we pray to thee
to keep us from evil and despair.

05:37.135 --> 05:40.910
Feed us with the bread
that does not perish, which is thy word.

05:42.319 --> 05:45.188
O Lord, amen.

05:59.407 --> 06:00.552
Mister!

06:00.751 --> 06:02.890
- I don't know what your name is, but...
- Ducrucq.

06:02.959 --> 06:05.959
Why did you leave?
Did I say something wrong?

06:06.255 --> 06:09.289
I saw you leave.
What did I say that offended you?

06:09.359 --> 06:10.668
Just because it's Sunday...

06:10.735 --> 06:13.418
you don't expect us to listen
to the kind of pious bilge...

06:13.488 --> 06:15.691
- you gave us just now.
- Bilge?

06:15.759 --> 06:19.556
Look, I worked all week on that sermon.
I meant every word of it.

06:19.695 --> 06:23.557
Listen, mister. Every now and then,
somebody comes here from the outside...

06:23.631 --> 06:25.387
and tries to help us.

06:25.455 --> 06:29.995
They mean well. So do you, probably,
but that doesn't help us at all, does it?

06:31.663 --> 06:34.118
I want to bring you the word of God.

06:34.575 --> 06:37.870
- What can I do? Tell me.
- I don't know.

06:38.703 --> 06:41.124
Help me. Help me
to understand you people...

06:41.199 --> 06:44.363
to know you. Take me into your homes
where you live.

06:44.527 --> 06:46.185
We don't live here.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.382
We only come here to sleep.

06:49.871 --> 06:53.799
Down there, 2,000 feet underground,
that's where we live.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.870
Can I go down? Take me.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.613
- Will you take me down?
- Sure, I can arrange it.

07:02.735 --> 07:05.452
Be here in the morning when I go to work.

07:05.936 --> 07:07.146
At 4:00.

07:25.839 --> 07:28.589
I'm trembling inside of me
just as much as you are.

07:29.039 --> 07:31.592
And I've been going down for 33 years.

07:58.703 --> 08:00.939
- How old is that child?
- Eleven.

08:01.839 --> 08:04.141
- How long has she been working here?
- A year.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.792
Her father was killed in the explosion.

08:15.855 --> 08:19.685
<i>Listen, mister. Every now and then,</i>
<i>somebody comes here from the outside...</i>

08:19.759 --> 08:21.482
<i>and tries to help us.</i>

08:21.551 --> 08:26.090
<i>They mean well. So do you, probably,</i>
<i>but that doesn't help us at all, does it?</i>

09:47.887 --> 09:49.064
Ducrucq.

10:16.591 --> 10:19.886
Come down! Somebody...

10:19.951 --> 10:22.537
Why don't you come down
and wait with us?

10:28.046 --> 10:29.989
What are you waiting for?

10:47.183 --> 10:50.566
I've got a blanket in there
for one of the wounded, and some bread.

10:50.639 --> 10:52.133
What about you?

10:53.423 --> 10:54.797
Wait for me.

10:59.279 --> 11:00.522
Van Gogh.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.077
I see you don't remember us.

11:03.151 --> 11:05.540
From the Committee
of the Messengers of the Faith.

11:05.615 --> 11:08.779
I'm glad you've come. Did you bring
food and clothes for the families?

11:08.847 --> 11:10.919
- Families?
- Another accident?

11:11.823 --> 11:13.481
- You didn't know?
- I'm sorry to hear it.

11:13.551 --> 11:15.591
- Were there many lost?
- Six.

11:16.527 --> 11:19.909
- Four men, two children, 28 injured.
- Terrible.

11:20.238 --> 11:21.416
I'll see what we can do.

11:21.487 --> 11:24.007
It's unfortunate our visit
should have come at this time.

11:24.078 --> 11:25.485
But it was Rev. Peeters' wish.

11:25.551 --> 11:27.623
The purpose of our coming here
is an inspection.

11:27.695 --> 11:29.735
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'll be right back.

11:33.839 --> 11:36.838
- Just what is the meaning of this?
- You receive an allowance.

11:36.910 --> 11:40.653
Why have you chosen to live in the most
wretched, filthy shack in this village?

11:40.719 --> 11:43.850
Because we have no right to spread
the word of God to these people...

11:43.919 --> 11:45.261
unless we suffer as they do.

11:45.327 --> 11:48.426
You yourself are unclean.
Your clothes are ragged and dirty.

11:48.495 --> 11:50.283
There are people here
who have no clothes.

11:50.350 --> 11:53.547
Do you mean to tell us
you actually sleep on this dirt and straw...

11:53.615 --> 11:56.746
like a beast of the field? You,
the spiritual leader of the community?

11:56.815 --> 11:59.270
I gave my bed to a sick woman
who needed it more than I.

11:59.342 --> 12:01.993
You are new in this work.
I have no doubt you mean well.

12:02.063 --> 12:04.998
But by your behavior, you've degraded
the dignity of the church...

12:05.071 --> 12:07.754
- whose representative you are.
- Have you no sense of decency?

12:07.823 --> 12:10.605
Don't you understand
that if the clergy is to be respected...

12:10.670 --> 12:12.776
I don't care to be respected!

12:13.135 --> 12:15.372
I'm trying to live like a true Christian.

12:15.439 --> 12:18.024
I'm not going to worry about how I sleep.

12:18.094 --> 12:21.094
Look at the fresh graves of the children
in the cemetery.

12:21.295 --> 12:23.684
Scrub floors and pick coal
with the women.

12:23.854 --> 12:27.116
Get those fine clothes dirty
with the blood and sweat of dying miners.

12:27.182 --> 12:29.451
Then come here
and lecture me about Christianity!

12:29.518 --> 12:31.885
Hypocrites!

12:49.583 --> 12:51.143
But you must have heard of him.

12:51.215 --> 12:54.663
He came here about a year ago
as a preacher. Vincent van Gogh.

12:55.182 --> 12:58.248
Yes, mister.
You'll find him in the little shack.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.345
Vincent.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.019
Who is it?

13:47.759 --> 13:49.068
It's Theo.

13:54.446 --> 13:56.715
- Vincent, what have you done to yourself?
- Theo.

13:56.782 --> 13:58.092
What's happened to you?

13:58.159 --> 14:00.428
I was sick for a while,
but I'm all right now.

14:00.495 --> 14:02.088
Doesn't anyone look after you?

14:02.159 --> 14:05.475
- I'd better go and get you some food.
- Don't go. Stay and talk.

14:05.551 --> 14:09.326
- Where's the nearest place where I can...
- Please don't go, Theo.

14:09.839 --> 14:11.846
It's been such a long time.

14:22.479 --> 14:24.813
What are we going to do about you?

14:28.558 --> 14:31.493
Father wrote and asked me
to come and find you.

14:31.759 --> 14:35.141
- For months he's not heard from you.
- There was nothing to tell.

14:35.503 --> 14:37.543
What right have you to decide that?

14:37.615 --> 14:40.484
Cut yourself off from everybody,
even from me.

14:41.455 --> 14:44.454
You've become a stranger.
You've changed.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.022
I haven't changed, Theo.

14:47.535 --> 14:51.845
Outwardly, perhaps, but inside me,
I still want the same things.

14:51.919 --> 14:53.228
What things?

14:53.295 --> 14:55.946
The things we talked about
in the old days.

14:56.015 --> 15:00.139
To be of use, to work,
to bring something to the world.

15:01.135 --> 15:03.372
Do you think this is the answer?

15:04.751 --> 15:06.158
I don't know.

15:08.911 --> 15:10.733
We've grown apart, Theo.

15:10.798 --> 15:14.475
Look, you found what you wanted in Paris
and I'm glad for you.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.287
I've found nothing anywhere.

15:18.030 --> 15:21.326
I've made one bad start after another.
One mess after another.

15:21.775 --> 15:24.906
I thought I was on my way here
by doing God's work.

15:25.775 --> 15:28.142
That was the worst failure of all.

15:29.198 --> 15:32.198
But no matter how often I fail,
there is something in me.

15:32.270 --> 15:36.231
- That I am good for something.
- But this is not the way to find it.

15:37.743 --> 15:40.710
Hiding away here, wasting your time.

15:41.647 --> 15:43.502
You've become an idler.

15:45.358 --> 15:47.016
An idler? Yes.

15:48.303 --> 15:50.637
But there are two kinds of idlers.

15:50.991 --> 15:54.766
There's the man who's idle
because he wants to be, out of laziness.

15:54.831 --> 15:57.580
How easy that is. I envy him.

16:00.591 --> 16:02.696
There's the other kind...

16:02.863 --> 16:05.164
the man who's idle in spite of himself.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.173
I want nothing but to work.

16:07.790 --> 16:09.197
Only, I can't.

16:10.895 --> 16:15.205
I'm in a cage, a cage of shame
and self-doubt and failure.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.969
Somebody believe me.

16:18.414 --> 16:20.237
I'm caged. I'm alone.

16:21.390 --> 16:22.885
I'm frightened.

16:28.847 --> 16:31.268
Vincent, listen to me.

16:33.647 --> 16:37.095
When we were children,
I used to follow you about.

16:38.991 --> 16:42.187
If I was frightened, I'd run to look for you.

16:43.695 --> 16:47.273
If I got lost, you'd always come to find me.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.684
We're still brothers, we're friends...

16:53.903 --> 16:55.812
we can trust one another.

16:56.335 --> 16:58.506
That's stronger than any cage.

17:00.654 --> 17:04.002
Whatever you do, from now on,
wherever you go...

17:05.454 --> 17:09.032
promise me, make me part of it.

17:10.541 --> 17:13.259
Don't ever cut yourself off from me again.

17:17.742 --> 17:20.492
- What is it?
- My pipe.

17:25.231 --> 17:27.053
Let me take you home...

17:27.534 --> 17:29.990
where you can live and be cared for.

17:32.559 --> 17:34.468
Until you find your way.

17:46.414 --> 17:48.389
Tell me, if you were me...

17:48.590 --> 17:50.979
which would you want
to have your money in?

17:51.374 --> 17:53.763
These are both accredited canvases.

17:54.190 --> 17:56.873
Both were exhibited in last year's salon.

17:58.094 --> 18:01.739
Perhaps you'd prefer to be left alone
for a moment to make your choice.

18:01.807 --> 18:03.879
I shall be in the next room.

18:11.759 --> 18:13.166
<i>Dear Theo...</i>

18:15.086 --> 18:17.901
<i>you were right. It's so good to be home.</i>

18:18.318 --> 18:20.391
<i>To live in peace for a time.</i>

18:20.815 --> 18:24.743
<i>Once again, thanks to you,</i>
<i>life seems precious to me.</i>

18:25.326 --> 18:27.628
<i>Something to be valued and loved.</i>

18:28.014 --> 18:29.837
<i>Once again I'm working.</i>

18:30.030 --> 18:33.740
<i>You know how for years,</i>
<i>whenever I saw anything that moved me...</i>

18:33.806 --> 18:35.628
<i>I felt the need to draw it.</i>

18:35.694 --> 18:38.596
<i>To get it down on paper,</i>
<i>no matter how crudely.</i>

18:38.670 --> 18:41.518
<i>Now, for the first time,</i>
<i>I've begun to wonder...</i>

18:41.582 --> 18:43.687
<i>could this be the way for me?</i>

18:44.014 --> 18:47.942
<i>A man or a woman at work.</i>
<i>Some furrows in a plowed field.</i>

18:48.495 --> 18:50.884
<i>A bit of sand, sea, or sky.</i>

18:51.214 --> 18:55.557
<i>These are subjects so difficult,</i>
<i>and at the same time, so beautiful...</i>

18:56.206 --> 18:59.021
<i>that it's worth spending one's whole life...</i>

18:59.086 --> 19:02.763
<i>trying to capture the poetry</i>
<i>that's hidden in them.</i>

19:14.350 --> 19:17.067
Vincent, have you lost all track of time?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.067
Father's upset,
we're practically through dinner.

19:20.142 --> 19:21.931
You go ahead. I just want to finish this.

19:21.999 --> 19:25.163
Couldn't you try to be on time
just once in a while?

19:25.327 --> 19:29.156
Especially with Cousin Kay here.
She brought little Jan with her.

19:31.247 --> 19:34.563
And, Vincent, try not to argue with Father.
Not today.

19:41.358 --> 19:43.016
I'm sorry I'm late.

19:44.431 --> 19:47.497
Vincent, aren't you going to say hello
to your cousin Kay?

19:47.726 --> 19:49.187
Hello, cousin.

19:50.639 --> 19:51.980
Hello, Kay.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.640
You must pardon Vincent.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.809
He's so interested in his new work,
he forgets where he is sometimes.

20:00.878 --> 20:03.115
- Vincent is an artist these days.
- Draws on paper.

20:03.182 --> 20:04.970
Lovely things: Swamps, woods, people...

20:05.039 --> 20:07.722
He's made a drawing of me.
He makes us all pose for him.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.245
If you don't watch out,
he'll make you pose, too, cousin.

20:10.318 --> 20:11.300
And Jan.

20:11.374 --> 20:13.196
You should see the way
he makes people look.

20:13.262 --> 20:16.394
Vincent, you're looking at me
as though you've never seen me before.

20:16.463 --> 20:19.496
It's been a long time.
Not since before Vos died.

20:22.542 --> 20:23.851
I'm sorry.

20:24.622 --> 20:27.110
I guess I shouldn't have mentioned it.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.735
Even though it's been almost a year.

20:29.807 --> 20:31.017
Vincent.

20:31.567 --> 20:34.698
One doesn't measure such things
in weeks and months, Vincent.

20:34.766 --> 20:37.635
No, of course not. See, I only meant that...

20:37.774 --> 20:41.833
I was gonna write to you, Cousin Kay,
but I'm not very good at those things...

20:42.094 --> 20:44.679
and then so much time went by that I...

20:44.750 --> 20:47.750
Jan's being very quiet.
I hope he's not getting up to any mischief.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.099
Excuse me.

20:54.190 --> 20:57.190
- Vincent, really...
- Couldn't you see how she felt?

20:57.262 --> 20:59.782
You know how it was with her and Vos?

21:00.015 --> 21:02.120
It's not right to grieve that long.

21:02.191 --> 21:04.580
God didn't intend the living
to mourn forever.

21:04.654 --> 21:07.524
I hardly think you're the best judge
of God's intentions.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.533
Do you realize you haven't been to church
once since you got back?

21:10.606 --> 21:12.167
You, the minister's son.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.246
What do you think
they're saying in the village?

21:14.319 --> 21:17.766
I act out of my beliefs, Father.
Not because I want to please the village.

21:17.838 --> 21:20.140
I happen not to believe
in the God or the clergymen.

21:20.206 --> 21:21.864
For me, he's as dead as a doornail.

21:21.934 --> 21:24.618
Children, if you've finished,
leave the table, please.

21:24.686 --> 21:26.541
Go into the other room.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.708
Vincent, before the children?

21:34.318 --> 21:36.391
Do you realize what you said?

21:36.462 --> 21:39.080
Yes, Mother. But I must say what I feel.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.984
I'm not an atheist. I do believe in God.

21:43.310 --> 21:46.791
A God of love, Father, and I believe
there are many ways to serve him.

21:46.862 --> 21:50.178
One man does it from a pulpit,
another through a book or a painting.

21:50.254 --> 21:51.977
Let's not discuss it.

21:57.486 --> 22:01.414
I'm sorry, Father,
but I was just telling you my opinion.

22:02.350 --> 22:05.252
Did you have a good morning
in the fields, Vincent?

22:05.326 --> 22:06.820
Like any other.

22:07.278 --> 22:09.765
Do you feel the drawing's going well?

22:10.607 --> 22:12.200
You work so hard and...

22:12.527 --> 22:15.429
I can't help noticing
you go over and over your drawings...

22:15.502 --> 22:17.477
and often as not, you throw them away.

22:17.550 --> 22:21.674
What Mother means is, we'd hate
to see you keep struggling, Vincent...

22:22.030 --> 22:24.680
only to realize in the end,
it was just another failure.

22:24.750 --> 22:28.525
Maybe he could visit Cousin Mauve
in The Hague. He's a successful artist.

22:28.590 --> 22:32.747
Ask him his opinion of your drawings.
I'm sure he'd be glad to help you.

22:32.814 --> 22:36.709
I'm not ready to show my work to Mauve.
When I am, I'll go to him.

22:42.734 --> 22:44.425
I'm sorry, Vincent.

22:45.775 --> 22:48.328
- How's Jan?
- He's all right. Thank you.

22:52.558 --> 22:54.533
I'm glad you're here, Kay.

22:55.598 --> 22:58.467
<i>Please, Theo, send more paper</i>
<i>and drawing ink.</i>

22:58.542 --> 23:01.576
<i>I'm afraid I quickly used up</i>
<i>what you sent last month.</i>

23:01.646 --> 23:04.329
<i>As I work at my drawings day after day...</i>

23:04.654 --> 23:06.989
<i>what seemed unattainable before...</i>

23:07.054 --> 23:09.443
<i>is now gradually becoming possible.</i>

23:09.806 --> 23:12.523
<i>Slowly, I'm learning</i>
<i>to observe and measure.</i>

23:13.390 --> 23:16.805
<i>I don't stand quite so helpless</i>
<i>before nature any longer.</i>

23:21.038 --> 23:22.948
Come on, Jan, you rascal.

23:27.886 --> 23:31.432
<i>I know there's still something</i>
<i>harsh and stiff in my style.</i>

23:31.918 --> 23:36.457
<i>Although, to tell the truth, I believe</i>
<i>the presence of Kay here this summer...</i>

23:37.262 --> 23:40.557
<i>is beginning to have a softening influence</i>
<i>on my work.</i>

23:41.422 --> 23:43.244
Time for your nap, now.

23:48.462 --> 23:50.567
There we go. Cover you up.

23:57.550 --> 24:00.649
He fell asleep almost as soon
as I put him down. Thank you.

24:00.718 --> 24:02.540
He's getting to be such a boy.

24:02.606 --> 24:05.323
It's been a wonderful summer
for him here.

24:05.390 --> 24:07.463
It's been a wonderful summer.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.397
- How did it go today? Well?
- When you're with me, it always goes well.

24:11.470 --> 24:13.095
I'm glad, Vincent.

24:13.422 --> 24:15.015
You work so hard.

24:17.070 --> 24:19.754
I see your light on often,
halfway through the night.

24:19.822 --> 24:22.571
There's so much to learn,
not only about drawing, but people.

24:22.638 --> 24:25.093
How they feel and think,
the world they live in.

24:25.166 --> 24:27.587
Before you can paint them,
you have to know that, too.

24:27.662 --> 24:29.549
So I read everything
I can get my hands on.

24:29.614 --> 24:31.501
Dickens, Zola, Michelet.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.343
You know what Michelet says?

24:34.606 --> 24:37.421
"Blessed is the man
who's found his worth...

24:37.486 --> 24:39.396
"and one woman to love."

24:41.646 --> 24:44.777
- I need love, Kay.
- Of course you do.

24:45.262 --> 24:48.296
I need it to be myself,
to be able to breathe it.

24:49.198 --> 24:51.719
I want a home. I want children.

24:54.670 --> 24:58.728
Vos felt the same way. He made
Jan and me the center of his existence.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.897
- Nothing else counted for him...
- Stop talking about Vos. He's dead.

25:01.966 --> 25:05.065
And we're alive, Kay. In the present.
The present.

25:05.870 --> 25:06.885
- I love you, Kay.
- No.

25:06.958 --> 25:08.813
Listen to me,
we're both alone in the world.

25:08.878 --> 25:10.918
We need each other.
Look, we'll have a home.

25:10.990 --> 25:13.128
We'll be happy. I promise you.

25:14.510 --> 25:15.492
No.

25:17.454 --> 25:21.066
In God's name, don't be frightened.
I'm only saying I want to marry you.

25:21.134 --> 25:23.785
To be your husband, and a father to Jan.

25:23.854 --> 25:25.381
No. Never!

25:26.926 --> 25:29.130
<i>No. Never.</i>

25:30.414 --> 25:33.131
<i>I tell you, Theo, this thing threatens me.</i>

25:33.806 --> 25:36.588
<i>Love is something so strong, so real...</i>

25:37.166 --> 25:39.719
<i>that it's as impossible to quench it...</i>

25:39.790 --> 25:42.440
<i>as it is for a man to take his own life.</i>

25:43.758 --> 25:46.987
<i>I must see her face again</i>
<i>and speak to her once more.</i>

25:47.566 --> 25:51.495
- I'd like to see Miss Kay.
- I'm afraid she's out, sir.

25:51.566 --> 25:54.882
No, you can't go in there, sir.
The family's at dinner.

25:56.686 --> 25:58.147
He pushed his way in, sir.

25:58.222 --> 26:01.571
I see now what people mean when
they complain about your bad manners.

26:01.646 --> 26:03.239
- Where's Kay?
- She's not here.

26:03.310 --> 26:04.837
She's visiting friends.

26:04.910 --> 26:07.692
- Vincent, please, sit down.
- She was just sitting here.

26:07.758 --> 26:10.213
Can't you understand
a simple word like "no"?

26:10.286 --> 26:13.602
Don't you realize what it meant
when Kay returned your letters unopened?

26:13.678 --> 26:15.685
May I speak to Kay, please?

26:16.238 --> 26:18.921
My dear, will you leave us alone, please?

26:23.597 --> 26:26.412
Must you persist in the face of everything?

26:26.926 --> 26:30.668
Try to be reasonable, Vincent.
Even if Kay returned your love...

26:30.734 --> 26:34.029
how could you possibly hope
to provide a home for her?

26:34.094 --> 26:35.883
You haven't earned money in a long time.

26:35.950 --> 26:38.121
- You don't even have...
- lf a man loves, he lives.

26:38.190 --> 26:40.295
If he lives, he works.
If he works, he has bread.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.733
You think I'm a tramp?
I'll be penniless all my life?

26:42.797 --> 26:44.969
- It's not just a question of money...
- Listen to me!

26:45.038 --> 26:47.012
All I ask is a chance to show Kay my love.

26:47.086 --> 26:49.290
To help her understand
why she must love me.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.424
Surely you've been in love.
You know what agonies a man can suffer...

26:52.494 --> 26:54.283
Agonies? Are you such a weakling...

26:54.350 --> 26:57.252
that you can't stand the little pain
of a disappointment in love?

26:57.326 --> 26:59.562
Do you have to whimper about it?

27:01.678 --> 27:03.751
What do you know about pain?

27:04.462 --> 27:07.429
I've seen agonies
that you've never dreamed of.

27:10.574 --> 27:14.568
Let me talk to Kay for as long as
I can keep my hand in this flame.

27:19.566 --> 27:20.776
Vincent!

27:24.494 --> 27:26.730
Have you gone out of your mind?

27:26.990 --> 27:29.740
- Do you hear me whimpering?
- Listen to me, my boy.

27:29.806 --> 27:33.101
I'd let you talk to Kay
to your heart's content, but for one thing.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.981
She refuses to see you again, ever.

27:36.718 --> 27:38.092
I don't believe it.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.005
She said that your persistence
disgusted her.

27:41.870 --> 27:45.317
There are some things
that can't be controlled by wishes.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.081
Love is one of them.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.413
I'm sorry.

27:49.486 --> 27:53.032
But did she say I disgusted her?

27:54.701 --> 27:55.716
Yes.

27:58.029 --> 28:01.608
- Did she actually say that?
- Yes.

28:09.518 --> 28:11.460
All right, I'm sorry, too.

28:12.654 --> 28:14.345
- I'll be going.
- Where are you staying?

28:14.414 --> 28:16.869
- Would you like to spend the night here?
- No, thank you.

28:16.942 --> 28:19.495
- Lf Kay leaves the house...
- Let me take care of your hand.

28:19.566 --> 28:22.086
- Take care of yourself, Vincent.
- Our love to your family.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.652
- Good night.
- Good night, boy.

28:49.006 --> 28:51.210
Come on. Let's get out of here.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.657
Come on. If you want to sit here,
that's all right.

29:05.070 --> 29:06.248
More wine?

29:06.318 --> 29:07.812
- On credit?
- No.

29:28.077 --> 29:29.506
You all right?

29:30.222 --> 29:33.670
I'm sick. I'm tired. Just leave me alone.

29:38.029 --> 29:41.924
Everything's rotten. Now I understand
why people drown themselves.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.894
- Don't say things like that.
- Why not?

29:46.509 --> 29:49.892
- Suicide's a terrible thing.
- What do you know about it?

29:54.797 --> 29:57.186
What are you, anyway? A working man?

29:58.445 --> 30:00.584
- Yes.
- You don't talk like one.

30:02.989 --> 30:04.778
Thanks for the brandy.

30:10.382 --> 30:13.513
I'm a laundress,
when I have the strength to scrub.

30:14.734 --> 30:17.516
And when I haven't, I look for easier work.

30:20.430 --> 30:23.561
I have a baby to feed.
He's at home with my mother.

30:24.334 --> 30:26.755
- Where's your husband?
- What husband?

30:29.517 --> 30:31.590
I've been at the tubs all day.

30:31.662 --> 30:35.623
They were supposed to pay me tonight
but they put me off till tomorrow.

30:35.694 --> 30:38.661
- Can't your mother help you?
- She's helped plenty.

30:38.734 --> 30:40.774
She's taught me all I know.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.722
Can I have another?

30:45.933 --> 30:48.584
Here. Put this in your pocket instead.

30:49.134 --> 30:51.523
- I'm only sorry it isn't more.
- Who bit your hand?

30:51.597 --> 30:53.637
- I burned it.
- Let me see it.

30:58.446 --> 31:01.163
What were you trying to do?
Fry it for dinner?

31:01.358 --> 31:04.205
- I'll get something for it.
- It'll be all right.

31:04.269 --> 31:06.691
Got any oil or butter
in this cockroach trap?

31:06.766 --> 31:08.675
We sell drinks, not food.

31:09.166 --> 31:11.468
It's a bad burn. Come home with me.

31:11.534 --> 31:14.600
- I'll dress it for you before it gets worse.
- Thank you. It'll heal.

31:14.670 --> 31:18.314
What's the matter with you?
You're afraid to be seen with me?

31:41.038 --> 31:44.835
<i>This is a woman, Theo,</i>
<i>who is far from young, far from pretty...</i>

31:45.453 --> 31:47.722
<i>but she was good to me, and kind.</i>

31:48.302 --> 31:51.815
<i>She's evidently had a great deal of trouble</i>
<i>and a hard life...</i>

31:51.886 --> 31:55.595
<i>and there's nothing at all</i>
<i>distinguished or unusual about her.</i>

31:55.694 --> 31:57.766
<i>We talked about all sorts of things. ;</i>

31:57.837 --> 32:00.358
<i>her life, her troubles, her poverty...</i>

32:01.069 --> 32:03.077
<i>her health, her loneliness.</i>

32:06.190 --> 32:09.485
If you had nothing at all,
it'd make no difference.

32:11.533 --> 32:15.363
Since you came over and talked to me,
I don't feel alone anymore.

32:16.814 --> 32:18.821
I don't know how to say it.

32:18.990 --> 32:21.411
<i>The clergymen would call us sinners.</i>

32:22.285 --> 32:26.115
<i>Is it a sin to love, Theo,</i>
<i>to be in need of love?</i>

32:27.245 --> 32:29.667
<i>Not to be able to live without love?</i>

32:38.286 --> 32:39.693
Cousin Mauve.

32:40.718 --> 32:43.784
Vincent. I'm sorry to put off seeing you...

32:43.854 --> 32:46.090
but we artists have to be selfish,
you know.

32:46.158 --> 32:47.751
We have to save ourselves.

32:47.822 --> 32:50.604
After all, with each painting,
we die a little.

32:50.670 --> 32:52.393
What have you there?

32:53.261 --> 32:54.570
I'm trying to draw.

32:54.637 --> 32:56.874
I was wondering if you'd be willing
to help me.

32:56.941 --> 33:00.389
I wouldn't ask much. Just let me
watch you work now and then.

33:00.462 --> 33:02.851
And sometimes, when you're resting...

33:02.925 --> 33:06.242
if you would look at my things
and tell me my mistakes.

33:06.990 --> 33:09.324
You think that's not asking much?

33:11.501 --> 33:15.811
But these are just copying exercises.
Don't you have anything of your own?

33:19.629 --> 33:21.931
You've been out at the beach
at Scheveningen.

33:21.998 --> 33:25.064
Don't be in such a hurry,
seascapes are difficult.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.340
Yes, indeed.

33:37.294 --> 33:40.108
You know, I expected to find you a dullard.

33:41.069 --> 33:42.444
I was wrong.

33:45.646 --> 33:49.802
They're clumsy, most of them,
but I can see what you're getting at.

33:51.213 --> 33:53.068
And that you've worked.

33:57.933 --> 33:59.340
Yes, that...

34:00.654 --> 34:02.247
Tell me something.

34:02.606 --> 34:05.323
What kind of an artist do you want to be?

34:05.773 --> 34:08.261
I want to create things that touch people.

34:08.333 --> 34:12.163
I want to move them so they say,
"He feels deeply and tenderly."

34:14.701 --> 34:18.149
That's fine.
But before you can move people...

34:18.445 --> 34:22.601
you first have to learn your business.
It needs skill as well as heart.

34:23.534 --> 34:24.777
Tell me something.

34:24.846 --> 34:27.081
- Have you ever worked in color?
- No.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.899
You better start working right away
in watercolors and oil.

34:29.965 --> 34:30.947
It'll help your drawing.

34:31.021 --> 34:33.956
- I don't know anything about color.
- I will teach you.

34:34.029 --> 34:35.556
We'll work together here.

34:35.629 --> 34:37.123
- Cousin Mauve...
- No.

34:37.197 --> 34:38.888
When I'm less tired.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.915
Now, you'll need some watercolors.
Here they are.

34:44.077 --> 34:46.695
Some brushes, some oil...

34:47.725 --> 34:50.572
and... No. This is an incomplete set...

34:50.637 --> 34:51.946
but it'll do for now.

34:52.013 --> 34:56.203
There's a palette, palette knife,
oil, turpentine.

34:56.493 --> 34:58.566
Better have a couple of these.

34:59.245 --> 35:02.562
Now, to improve your drawing,
you'll need to use casts.

35:03.246 --> 35:04.936
Now let me see. Yes.

35:05.197 --> 35:08.045
Take these home with you
and see that you work from them...

35:08.109 --> 35:10.597
not less than
three hours each day, faithfully.

35:10.670 --> 35:13.288
- Have you a place to work?
- I found a flat near the market...

35:13.358 --> 35:15.213
- Has it got good light?
- I usually work out...

35:15.278 --> 35:17.929
- How are you fixed for money?
- Theo's been sending me money.

35:17.998 --> 35:20.070
The first few months
are always the hardest.

35:20.141 --> 35:23.174
I don't suppose
a little extra will be unwelcome?

35:23.629 --> 35:26.695
- Cousin Mauve...
- That will help you set yourself up.

35:26.765 --> 35:28.521
- I can't tell you how...
- Not at all.

35:28.589 --> 35:30.956
Now, come back next week,
let me see what you've done.

35:31.021 --> 35:33.356
Please forgive me for barging in
when you're so tired.

35:33.421 --> 35:34.599
Don't. That's all right.

35:34.670 --> 35:36.841
- Just take these with you.
- Yeah.

35:36.973 --> 35:39.591
- I can't tell you how grateful I am.
- That's all right.

35:39.661 --> 35:41.090
Now take that.

35:47.693 --> 35:49.897
How much longer do you need us?

35:50.381 --> 35:53.797
I can't get supper ready
sitting in this chair, you know.

35:55.021 --> 35:57.705
I'm sorry. You can get up now.

35:58.029 --> 35:59.916
I'm going to the market.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.987
Next time, will you keep
some money for food?

36:09.933 --> 36:12.933
If we could eat drawings,
it might be different.

36:13.549 --> 36:15.818
I saved some money.
You dropped it on the beach.

36:15.885 --> 36:17.773
I didn't give it back to you.

36:18.669 --> 36:23.077
My mother was right, getting myself
hooked up with a crazy painter.

36:24.301 --> 36:25.959
Keep an eye on him.

36:39.661 --> 36:43.719
<i>Dear Brother, I think of you so often,</i>
<i>so very, very often these days.</i>

36:44.814 --> 36:48.807
<i>If only you could be here</i>
<i>and see for yourself how it is with us. ;</i>

36:49.389 --> 36:52.259
<i>that this is a real home, rooted in life...</i>

36:53.165 --> 36:56.580
<i>with a woman and a cradle,</i>
<i>and a child's high chair.</i>

36:58.221 --> 37:01.156
<i>The feeling I have for Christine is real, too.</i>

37:20.526 --> 37:21.835
I'm tired.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.281
I'm going in to feed the baby.

37:29.934 --> 37:33.163
Not yet. Christine, come back!

37:38.637 --> 37:41.899
I'm fed up.
Month after month, it's the same thing.

37:42.254 --> 37:45.766
- What's the matter now?
- I'm fed up with living on bread and coffee.

37:46.125 --> 37:49.606
You take every penny you're given
and throw it away on paints and canvases.

37:49.677 --> 37:51.816
- Don't start that again.
- Look at these.

37:51.885 --> 37:54.919
How much do they cost?
You haven't even used up the old ones yet.

37:54.990 --> 37:57.193
Shut up. Don't interfere with things
you don't know.

37:57.262 --> 38:00.523
I won't. I have to pick up after you,
mend those rags you call clothes...

38:00.589 --> 38:02.694
pose for you for hours,
on top of everything else.

38:02.765 --> 38:05.897
- What do you think I am? Your slave?
- Stop nagging!

38:08.397 --> 38:11.812
Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't better off
the way I was.

38:14.477 --> 38:16.681
Don't you dare. Do you hear me?

38:17.453 --> 38:20.836
If only we could have a piece of meat
once in a while, or an egg.

38:20.910 --> 38:24.390
I'm sick of worrying every night
how we'll get money to eat the next day.

38:24.461 --> 38:26.370
You call that a life?

38:28.141 --> 38:29.667
Couldn't you write to your brother?

38:29.741 --> 38:31.781
I can't ask him again.
He's helping all he can.

38:31.853 --> 38:33.828
What about the man
who wanted to meet you?

38:33.901 --> 38:36.105
- Tersteeg.
- Maybe he could sell some of your stuff.

38:36.174 --> 38:39.173
I went to see him. Offered me
a hand-down like I was a beggar.

38:39.245 --> 38:40.772
Didn't you take it?

38:40.845 --> 38:44.423
He said I had no talent.
Even if I did, I started too late.

38:44.973 --> 38:48.202
That leaves only your cousin Mauve.
Couldn't he help?

38:52.077 --> 38:54.630
Or did you have a fight with him, too?

38:56.589 --> 38:57.571
Did you?

38:57.646 --> 39:00.907
Mauve can go to hell.
He helps me when he's in the mood.

39:00.973 --> 39:03.821
The rest of the time,
he doesn't care whether I'm dead or alive.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.732
"Oh, I'm sorry, my boy.
Go home. I can't see you now.

39:06.797 --> 39:08.258
"Go home and work with those casts."

39:08.333 --> 39:10.602
I'm sick of working
with those idiotic casts!

39:10.669 --> 39:12.808
Don't look down your nose
at those casts of his.

39:12.877 --> 39:14.786
He sells what he paints!

39:15.629 --> 39:19.241
I don't want to hear about those casts
from you or from anybody else!

39:34.253 --> 39:35.300
Cien?

39:38.669 --> 39:41.353
Where've you been?
I asked you where you've been.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.723
- At my mother's.
- For two days?

39:44.045 --> 39:46.827
- You said you wouldn't go back.
- There was something to eat.

39:46.893 --> 39:48.748
You promised
not to get into that life again.

39:48.813 --> 39:50.886
And some jokes for a change.

39:53.357 --> 39:56.772
- Where are you going?
- My father's ill. I have to go back.

40:02.253 --> 40:05.450
- How long will you be gone?
- Depends on what happens.

40:06.733 --> 40:09.416
- Vincent, I...
- Yes?

40:12.589 --> 40:13.930
What is it?

40:16.045 --> 40:17.255
Nothing.

40:21.357 --> 40:23.496
There's some painting muslin
left in the cupboard.

40:23.565 --> 40:24.743
Make some shirts for the boy.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.667
I won't be there when you get back.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.620
- Don't say that.
- I didn't want to tell you.

40:28.685 --> 40:31.849
I've been feeling restless.
Besides, my mother's right, what she said.

40:31.917 --> 40:33.805
You don't earn enough
for me and the baby.

40:33.869 --> 40:35.811
- It's a bad life.
- This is no time for...

40:35.885 --> 40:39.430
You'll forget about us once you get home.
It won't be hard.

40:41.165 --> 40:45.421
- Where will you go? How will you live?
- It'll be the old life, I suppose.

40:45.645 --> 40:48.133
Vincent, it's not your fault.
You've been good.

40:48.205 --> 40:51.816
You're the only person
who's ever been good to me and the baby.

40:51.885 --> 40:53.314
Just as if he was your own.

40:53.389 --> 40:54.698
All aboard.

41:11.149 --> 41:13.866
What is it
that came between Father and me?

41:13.997 --> 41:16.812
Why couldn't I have shown him
a little more consideration?

41:16.877 --> 41:18.950
Given him some pleasure
while he was alive?

41:19.021 --> 41:21.835
It wouldn't have hurt me
to come to his church once in a while.

41:21.901 --> 41:24.137
We always assume there's time...

41:24.621 --> 41:27.305
and that we can give love
on our own terms.

41:27.373 --> 41:31.563
Then one day we wake up and find
it's too late to give it on any terms.

41:35.725 --> 41:38.507
Will you go back to your life in The Hague?

41:39.149 --> 41:42.149
That's over.
It was wrong from the beginning.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.981
Come to Paris, Vincent.
We could live together.

41:48.685 --> 41:50.724
You're not the only one that's lonely.

41:50.797 --> 41:53.285
Not yet, Theo. Some day, but not now.

41:53.389 --> 41:56.171
You could meet other painters.
See what they're doing.

41:56.237 --> 41:59.815
If I'm to be anything as a painter,
I've got to break through the iron wall...

41:59.885 --> 42:02.602
between what I feel
and what I can express.

42:03.629 --> 42:06.117
And my best chance of doing it is here...

42:06.189 --> 42:08.807
where my roots are, the people I know...

42:11.820 --> 42:13.347
the earth I know.

42:20.812 --> 42:24.871
<i>Dear Theo, thank you for the money,</i>
<i>the paints, and canvas.</i>

42:25.677 --> 42:27.717
<i>With your help, I go forward.</i>

42:27.949 --> 42:30.982
<i>I feel the force to work</i>
<i>growing daily within me.</i>

42:31.533 --> 42:34.599
<i>Do your realize, Theo,</i>
<i>that what I'm doing is new?</i>

42:35.725 --> 42:38.146
<i>In the paintings of the old masters...</i>

42:38.221 --> 42:41.156
<i>did you ever see</i>
<i>a single man or woman at work?</i>

42:41.357 --> 42:44.673
<i>Did they ever try to paint a laborer,</i>
<i>or a man digging?</i>

42:44.845 --> 42:46.187
<i>They didn't.</i>

42:46.253 --> 42:49.515
<i>And for good reason. ;</i>
<i>because work is so hard to draw.</i>

42:58.444 --> 43:01.925
Just look at the way he's dressed.
That old sheepskin.

43:01.996 --> 43:05.095
Oh, my. I tell you, I'm sorry for the family.

43:06.093 --> 43:10.599
<i>To paint these people means to</i>
<i>be with them in the fields day after day...</i>

43:11.309 --> 43:13.545
<i>and by their firesides at night.</i>

43:16.301 --> 43:19.814
<i>Since the rains came,</i>
<i>I've become absorbed in the weavers.</i>

43:20.236 --> 43:22.342
<i>They make such good subjects.</i>

43:22.477 --> 43:25.673
<i>The old oak wood</i>
<i>darkened by sweating hands...</i>

43:26.125 --> 43:29.256
<i>and the shadows of the looms</i>
<i>on the gray mud walls.</i>

43:33.581 --> 43:36.134
<i>All these months</i>
<i>I've been trying to find a pattern...</i>

43:36.204 --> 43:39.914
<i>trying not so much to draw hands,</i>
<i>as gestures...</i>

43:40.205 --> 43:43.205
<i>not so much faces,</i>
<i>as the expressions of people.</i>

43:43.724 --> 43:46.441
<i>Men and women</i>
<i>who know the meaning of toil.</i>

43:49.453 --> 43:51.493
<i>I want to make clear that these people...</i>

43:51.564 --> 43:54.564
<i>sitting around a meal of potatoes</i>
<i>in the evening...</i>

43:54.636 --> 43:58.313
<i>have turned the soil</i>
<i>with the very hands they put in the dish.</i>

43:58.445 --> 44:01.162
<i>That they have honestly earned their food.</i>

44:01.292 --> 44:05.034
<i>I want to paint something</i>
<i>that smells of bacon smoke and steam.</i>

44:05.740 --> 44:09.155
<i>Something that's the good, dark color</i>
<i>of our Dutch earth.</i>

44:11.021 --> 44:13.126
Willemien. Come in.

44:16.012 --> 44:17.474
Here, sit down.

44:22.124 --> 44:23.717
What's the matter?

44:25.069 --> 44:27.752
- The neighbors been at you again?
- You know how they are.

44:27.820 --> 44:29.511
Such a small place.

44:30.220 --> 44:31.977
What is it this time?

44:33.709 --> 44:37.385
It has to do with
the way you dress, partly, and...

44:39.085 --> 44:41.954
I dress this way
because I work in the fields.

44:44.012 --> 44:46.085
Because I have nothing else.

44:46.797 --> 44:49.666
And the way you behave, too.
They don't understand it.

44:49.741 --> 44:51.628
It makes trouble for us.

44:52.909 --> 44:55.494
Since Father died, it hasn't been easy.

44:55.980 --> 44:59.276
People have stopped coming to the house.
They avoid us.

44:59.341 --> 45:01.642
It isn't very comfortable and...

45:01.869 --> 45:04.389
Is your young man
one of those who's stopped coming?

45:04.460 --> 45:06.762
Yes, he is.
But that doesn't matter so much.

45:06.828 --> 45:08.900
- Yes, it does.
- It's the rest of the family.

45:08.972 --> 45:12.202
Mother pretends she doesn't notice,
but I know it's upset her.

45:12.460 --> 45:15.460
She'll never tell you, so I felt I must.

45:18.797 --> 45:21.895
I'll get out. Take a few days to finish this,
and then I'll leave.

45:21.965 --> 45:24.201
No, Vincent. I didn't mean that.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.111
Of course you did, Willemien.

45:29.772 --> 45:31.266
It's all right.

45:32.333 --> 45:35.180
I've accomplished
what I stayed here to do...

45:36.621 --> 45:38.890
and maybe it is time to move on.

45:41.325 --> 45:44.391
I'm sick and tired of these cheap jokes.
Art is a serious business.

45:44.461 --> 45:47.178
And in Paris, at least.
An artist with a new idea should be...

45:47.245 --> 45:50.343
For once I agree with you, Durand-Ruel.
Impressionism is not a joke.

45:50.413 --> 45:52.235
It's a cancer and it must be cut out.

45:52.300 --> 45:55.464
Condone anarchism in the arts,
and you seal the doom of France.

45:55.532 --> 45:57.354
What would you do?
Padlock the galleries...

45:57.420 --> 45:59.624
- and ship the painters off to Devil's Island?
- No.

45:59.692 --> 46:02.856
They don't paint.
They load pistols with tubes of paint...

46:02.924 --> 46:04.386
and fire them at the canvas.

46:04.461 --> 46:06.795
And then have the audacity
to sign their names...

46:06.860 --> 46:11.333
Cézanne, Signac, Pissarro,
Gauguin, Renoir, Monet.

46:12.236 --> 46:14.124
You know these men.
You handled some of them.

46:14.188 --> 46:15.977
Why didn't you tell me about it?

46:16.045 --> 46:18.434
I wrote you in Antwerp.
Don't you read my letters?

46:18.509 --> 46:22.371
But seeing them, the colors,
and what they've done with light.

46:23.244 --> 46:26.278
- Is that painting?
- The critics and the public don't think so...

46:26.349 --> 46:28.105
nor do my employers at Goupil's.

46:28.172 --> 46:29.579
I can't believe it.

46:29.644 --> 46:32.197
Now, if they're right,
then everything I've done is wrong.

46:32.268 --> 46:34.155
Do they really know what they're doing?

46:34.221 --> 46:36.871
You've got to meet and talk to them,
see what they think.

46:36.940 --> 46:38.315
That's why I wanted you in Paris.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.584
Where can I meet them?
I got so many questions.

46:40.652 --> 46:42.954
- At 2:00 in the morning?
- Why not?

46:43.021 --> 46:46.087
Listen, take that thing off and settle down.

46:46.572 --> 46:48.481
You live here, you know.

46:49.356 --> 46:52.106
We've got to make a Parisian out of you.

46:53.132 --> 46:55.685
You'll have lots of time
to get your answers.

46:55.757 --> 46:58.244
Tomorrow, we'll start with Pissarro.

46:58.700 --> 47:02.083
It's the problem of translating light
into the language of paint.

47:02.156 --> 47:04.906
Those leaves there,
if they were the only thing in sight...

47:04.972 --> 47:07.274
they'd have one color, their own.

47:07.436 --> 47:10.087
But the shade and reflection
of everything around...

47:10.157 --> 47:13.866
the sky, the earth, the water,
give them more than their own color.

47:13.932 --> 47:17.609
That's why, when you paint from nature,
don't fix your eye on any one spot.

47:17.677 --> 47:19.716
Take in everything at once.

47:19.788 --> 47:22.155
And above all, don't be timid.

47:22.508 --> 47:24.548
<i>Trust your first impression.</i>

47:40.940 --> 47:44.999
<i>Everything you've been doing,</i>
<i>what we've all been doing. ; obsolete...</i>

47:45.069 --> 47:47.851
<i>the whole lot of us</i>
<i>guessing with every brush stroke...</i>

47:47.916 --> 47:51.658
pouring rivers of paint
into haphazard combinations...

47:51.724 --> 47:55.401
when actually, everything we're after
can be achieved mathematically.

47:55.468 --> 47:57.770
What are you talking about? Seurat again?

47:57.836 --> 48:00.619
Do you really think
a painting can be done by formula?

48:00.685 --> 48:03.751
Can be? Is being done, right here in Paris...

48:04.269 --> 48:06.690
through precise, scientific methods.

48:06.797 --> 48:08.804
I don't mix my colors on canvas.

48:08.876 --> 48:11.461
I mix them in the eye of the spectator.

48:12.588 --> 48:16.647
Once you accept the phenomenon of
the duration of light in the human retina...

48:16.716 --> 48:18.821
Excuse me. But this is a sunlit exterior.

48:18.892 --> 48:20.997
Now, why do you paint it indoors
by gaslight?

48:21.068 --> 48:24.102
- I mean, how can you judge your colors?
- Why not?

48:24.652 --> 48:27.041
Come on, Seurat,
put him out of his misery.

48:27.116 --> 48:30.858
- I've tried, but he's still in darkness.
- All right, Bernard. Come here.

48:32.844 --> 48:35.844
Everything I do is worked out in advance...

48:36.205 --> 48:39.652
with mathematical accuracy,
through precise scientific methods.

48:39.724 --> 48:41.961
I know exactly
what colors I'm going to use...

48:42.028 --> 48:43.621
before I pick up my brushes.

48:43.692 --> 48:47.270
And my palette is methodically prepared
in the order of the spectrum.

48:47.404 --> 48:50.787
As you see, blue, blue-violet,
violet, violet-red...

48:50.860 --> 48:52.289
<i>red, red-orange, orange-yellow...</i>

49:19.308 --> 49:20.355
Theo.

49:24.140 --> 49:27.686
- Can't it wait till morning?
- No, please, I need your help.

49:27.884 --> 49:28.932
Here.

49:31.212 --> 49:33.634
- What is it this time?
- Look at this.

49:38.828 --> 49:40.584
Yes, it's coming along.

49:41.324 --> 49:43.780
It's got a very good sense of light.

49:45.292 --> 49:49.285
- What's the matter? You look terrible.
- Will you be able to sell it?

49:51.532 --> 49:52.776
I'll try.

49:54.380 --> 49:58.089
It's hard to sell any of the new painters,
even the ones with some sort of name.

49:58.157 --> 49:59.880
You know how Goupil's begrudges me...

49:59.948 --> 50:02.282
the little space I can get for them
in the back room.

50:02.349 --> 50:04.804
Then why don't you leave Goupil's?
Set up for yourself.

50:04.877 --> 50:08.935
- Why waste time with idiots like that?
- Vincent, don't tell me how to run my life!

50:09.004 --> 50:11.306
It's taken me a long time
to get where I am.

50:11.372 --> 50:15.202
It may not be ideal, but, to me,
what I'm doing seems worthwhile.

50:15.660 --> 50:18.955
And you don't make it any easier.
I haven't had any sleep for six months.

50:19.020 --> 50:20.995
When people come to the house,
you insult them.

50:21.068 --> 50:22.923
Don't I have a right to express my opinion?

50:22.988 --> 50:26.304
This is my home.
You have no right to insult my guests!

50:29.900 --> 50:33.282
Maybe I shouldn't have come to Paris
in the first place.

50:41.132 --> 50:44.448
Vincent, all we've got
is what we can give each other.

50:45.580 --> 50:48.580
You know how much joy it would give me
to sell your paintings.

50:48.652 --> 50:51.107
I show them whenever I get a chance.

50:51.692 --> 50:54.594
But perhaps you should take some
to some other dealer.

50:54.764 --> 50:56.619
The more your work's seen, the better.

50:56.684 --> 50:59.018
Go to Père Tanguy.
I'll talk to him about you.

50:59.084 --> 51:00.907
- Why should...
- See what he can do for you.

51:00.972 --> 51:03.721
And show him some of your old work,
not just the new stuff.

51:03.788 --> 51:06.177
Is that your way of saying
the new work's no good?

51:06.252 --> 51:09.481
Vincent, I'm not going to argue with you
when you're in this mood.

51:09.548 --> 51:12.036
- What mood? All I'm trying...
- Good night.

51:12.108 --> 51:13.701
- Theo!
- Good night!

51:22.285 --> 51:24.651
Vincent, it's all good, all of it.

51:25.612 --> 51:29.028
The important thing is
that one day it could be sublime.

51:31.564 --> 51:35.274
Between then and now,
there's one thing you could do for me.

51:35.372 --> 51:37.793
A little thing, that's all I ask.

51:40.140 --> 51:42.180
Let me get a night's sleep.

51:46.284 --> 51:49.994
It's still the same. Nothing's changed
since I left here a year ago.

51:50.060 --> 51:51.205
That's right.

51:51.276 --> 51:54.244
You owed us 112 francs then
and you still do!

51:54.316 --> 51:57.066
- Tanguy, remove your wife.
- Get in the back.

51:57.132 --> 51:59.718
This man is absolutely correct, Tanguy.

52:00.204 --> 52:02.887
You cannot handle painters
and woodpeckers, too.

52:02.956 --> 52:06.535
The fact is, my dear friends,
that you are not painters.

52:07.404 --> 52:09.608
You are tattoo artists.

52:09.676 --> 52:11.880
You are chemists with little pots of paint.

52:11.948 --> 52:14.436
You cover canvases with colored fleas.

52:14.508 --> 52:16.810
You are so busy
imitating each other's tricks...

52:16.876 --> 52:19.145
you've forgotten what painting is about.

52:19.212 --> 52:20.489
You all make me sick.

52:20.556 --> 52:23.490
What doesn't make you sick, Paul,
besides your own work?

52:23.564 --> 52:26.434
Would you really like to know? That.

52:29.388 --> 52:31.941
Look at that. The clarity, the calm.

52:32.012 --> 52:34.183
The Japanese paint
as simply as we breathe.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.139
- Maybe they pay for their paints.
- Who is he?

52:36.204 --> 52:37.186
Paul Gauguin.

52:37.260 --> 52:40.294
You have to go halfway around the world
to find something you like?

52:40.364 --> 52:43.746
I don't have to leave this shop.
Look at that. And that.

52:44.620 --> 52:48.198
- And that, and that.
- Cézanne.

52:48.396 --> 52:51.113
- Yes. Cézanne.
- Yes. Cézanne.

52:51.340 --> 52:53.249
King of the unsaleables.

52:53.324 --> 52:55.746
I suppose you call this painting...

52:55.820 --> 52:57.608
Give me that painting!

53:05.676 --> 53:08.491
Yes. It's direct, it's vigorous.

53:08.556 --> 53:10.563
- What's your name?
- Vincent van Gogh.

53:10.636 --> 53:13.505
He has a statement to make
and he makes it. Theo's brother?

53:13.580 --> 53:15.751
Glad to know you. It's honest.

53:16.556 --> 53:19.207
It owes nothing to anybody. Nothing.

53:19.276 --> 53:22.178
Because it has nothing.
No tone, no values...

53:22.252 --> 53:24.074
- No color relations.
- Sense of space.

53:24.140 --> 53:27.620
The little men are at it again.
My friend, will you join me in a drink?

53:27.691 --> 53:31.237
- What about the 112 francs?
- Lady, go back to your kitchen.

53:31.820 --> 53:33.030
Get back.

53:33.612 --> 53:37.867
You see, down there the sun invades you,
gets into your blood.

53:37.932 --> 53:39.787
Not that Martinique was a paradise.

53:39.852 --> 53:43.168
Between hunger and fever,
I was lucky to get out alive.

53:43.468 --> 53:46.250
But if I could, I'd go back there tomorrow.

53:47.436 --> 53:50.403
- How long you been in Paris?
- Over a year.

53:50.476 --> 53:53.160
How can you stand it?
I can't work here. It strangles me.

53:53.228 --> 53:55.115
- Where would you go?
- Brittany.

53:55.179 --> 53:59.140
There's a place up there I can stay.
It's just a hole, but it's all I can afford.

53:59.212 --> 54:01.896
Wouldn't you miss your friends in Paris?

54:01.964 --> 54:04.647
Friends? A woman or two, maybe.

54:05.292 --> 54:08.194
When you start as late as I did,
you find yourself measuring...

54:08.267 --> 54:10.656
who and what you give your time to.

54:10.924 --> 54:13.128
Friends, comforts, family.

54:14.379 --> 54:18.089
If they interfere with your peace to work,
you cut them off...

54:18.508 --> 54:22.469
and you spend the rest of your life
wondering if it was worthwhile.

54:24.748 --> 54:27.715
If they're mad enough
to buy Impressionist paintings...

54:27.788 --> 54:30.243
it only proves that they're savages.

54:32.076 --> 54:35.425
I haven't seen the place looking so neat
since Vincent came to stay here.

54:35.499 --> 54:38.314
What got into him, cleaning it up like this?

54:40.460 --> 54:42.118
I do hope he's out.

54:42.188 --> 54:45.003
Never would get any business done
if he's in.

54:49.195 --> 54:50.505
What is it?

54:52.524 --> 54:54.117
It's from Vincent.

54:54.636 --> 54:57.287
"I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you,
and endlessly...

54:57.356 --> 54:59.592
"grateful for all your kindness.

54:59.788 --> 55:01.927
"I've hung a few paintings
to remind you of me."

55:01.996 --> 55:05.291
- He's gone?
- He's on his way south to Arles, Provence.

55:06.028 --> 55:08.002
"I've thought it over
these past few weeks...

55:08.076 --> 55:11.043
"and decided the time has come
to make a change.

55:11.404 --> 55:14.121
"I want to see nature under a clearer sky.

55:16.204 --> 55:18.091
"Have to work by myself for a while."

55:18.156 --> 55:22.411
No offense meant, but you'll be better off
without him around your neck.

55:22.508 --> 55:24.264
I think I'm the best judge of that.

55:24.332 --> 55:26.601
No, the worst.
You've been pushing his paintings.

55:26.668 --> 55:28.937
And every time you do that,
we lose a customer.

55:29.004 --> 55:31.077
As your employer,
I tell you for your own good...

55:31.148 --> 55:34.443
your love for Vincent has blinded
your judgment. It's affected your work.

55:34.508 --> 55:36.647
Please don't let's wrangle again
about that.

55:36.716 --> 55:39.683
I'll fight for every good painter
who deserves to be recognized...

55:39.756 --> 55:42.374
and Vincent is one of them.
He could be the best of them.

55:42.444 --> 55:45.095
What? Well, you're his brother.

55:45.260 --> 55:48.293
- You're emotional about him.
- That has nothing to do with it.

55:48.363 --> 55:51.942
What is it when you brood about him?
When you agonize over his every failure?

55:52.012 --> 55:55.143
When you support him
to the point of denying yourself?

55:55.212 --> 55:59.074
You've saved every letter he wrote
as though it were Holy Scripture.

55:59.148 --> 56:03.043
Come now, Theo. Don't you really think
you've done enough for him?

56:04.939 --> 56:06.663
How much is enough...

56:07.276 --> 56:10.854
for a man who's struggling with himself
the way Vincent is?

56:10.956 --> 56:14.272
I know he's crude, quarrelsome,
and excitable...

56:14.348 --> 56:17.795
but inside that tormented head of his
there's something wonderful.

56:17.867 --> 56:21.184
In those letters, there's a gifted man,
a tender man...

56:21.611 --> 56:24.808
and there's far more passionate beauty
and strength in his work...

56:24.876 --> 56:28.520
than there is in half the stuff
you see in the museums today.

56:29.228 --> 56:31.716
Wonder if there'll ever come
a happy time for him.

56:31.788 --> 56:33.893
It seems impossible for him
to have a quiet life.

56:33.964 --> 56:37.226
The change may do him good.
Maybe he'll find himself.

56:37.804 --> 56:40.292
Or will he only find more loneliness?

56:57.196 --> 56:58.505
This is it.

56:58.924 --> 57:02.088
At that, it's worth
more than you're willing to pay.

57:02.700 --> 57:04.609
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

57:04.684 --> 57:07.172
That'll be 8 francs for the week.

58:44.236 --> 58:45.643
Get these pictures out of here!

58:45.707 --> 58:48.009
- I told you a week ago.
- Don't touch that, you fool!

58:48.076 --> 58:49.538
Can't you see it's still wet?

58:49.611 --> 58:52.677
You're getting paint over everything.
That's why I raised your rent.

58:52.748 --> 58:54.635
You had no right to do it
without telling me.

58:54.699 --> 58:56.870
Whoever heard of a storage fee
for using a landing?

58:56.939 --> 58:58.849
- Then get your stuff out of here!
- I will not!

58:58.924 --> 59:00.298
Then pay me!

59:20.075 --> 59:21.766
- Allow me.
- No, don't.

59:23.211 --> 59:24.935
With your permission.

59:29.196 --> 59:32.065
- Looks like you're moving.
- I'm getting out of that hellhole.

59:32.747 --> 59:34.635
Here. I think you need some help.

59:34.700 --> 59:36.522
That swine of a landlord.

59:36.587 --> 59:39.271
Here you are.
I wondered how long you'd stand him.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.856
Where do you think you're going
with all this stuff?

59:42.924 --> 59:44.352
I don't know.

59:44.427 --> 59:47.297
You're gonna have to find some place
before night.

59:47.372 --> 59:50.503
I'd ask you to stay with me,
but it's a bit crowded with a wife...

59:50.572 --> 59:53.255
- and four kids and one on the way...
- Thanks, anyway.

59:53.323 --> 59:55.146
How'd you like a house?

59:57.003 --> 59:59.240
- Too expensive.
- Perhaps not.

59:59.756 --> 01:00:02.177
Come along, let me do the talking.

01:00:04.491 --> 01:00:07.306
If there's one thing I hate, it's landlords.

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:19.463
Come along.
You wouldn't want a dump like that.

01:00:19.531 --> 01:00:21.222
It should've been pulled down years ago.

01:00:21.292 --> 01:00:23.659
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you trying to do to me...

01:00:23.724 --> 01:00:25.284
talking like that about my property?

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:28.421
Is that what you're looking for, a house?
This is a fine house.

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:31.840
Look, my sister lived in it for 17 years
and then she died. God bless her.

01:00:31.915 --> 01:00:33.028
That's what I mean.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.166
Would you want me to show it to you?
How long would you want it for?

01:00:36.236 --> 01:00:38.407
He won't want it at all,
not when he's seen it.

01:00:38.476 --> 01:00:41.127
Now, look here, mind your own business
or I'll report you.

01:00:41.196 --> 01:00:45.189
I'll let you have it at a good price, too.
How about 15 francs a month?

01:00:45.259 --> 01:00:46.820
You stay out of this.

01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:50.055
On top of that, I'll let you have
the use of an extra room.

01:00:52.651 --> 01:00:55.204
<i>A house, Theo. I found a house.</i>

01:00:55.915 --> 01:00:59.177
<i>A place of my own</i>
<i>where I can work without a trouble.</i>

01:00:59.244 --> 01:01:01.284
<i>And where there's plenty of room.</i>

01:01:05.515 --> 01:01:09.312
<i>Roulin lent me a mattress to get started,</i>
<i>and I bought some chairs and a bed...</i>

01:01:09.388 --> 01:01:11.592
<i>and a few other things</i>
<i>that were necessary.</i>

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:14.976
<i>With this and with what I spent</i>
<i>on paints and canvas...</i>

01:01:15.052 --> 01:01:17.637
<i>my money for the month is almost gone.</i>

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.398
<i>But it was worth it.</i>

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.972
<i>Theo, you'd like this house.</i>

01:01:32.363 --> 01:01:35.527
<i>It's yellow on the outside</i>
<i>and filled with sunshine.</i>

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.284
<i>Later, two could live in it.</i>

01:01:37.355 --> 01:01:39.460
<i>One day, perhaps, Gauguin will come...</i>

01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:43.208
<i>and then, who knows,</i>
<i>this might turn into a colony of painters.</i>

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.881
<i>I'm up at dawn and out on the road.</i>

01:01:52.427 --> 01:01:55.046
<i>Now that summer's begun,</i>
<i>it's all very different here...</i>

01:01:55.116 --> 01:01:58.498
<i>from what it was in the spring.</i>
<i>But I love it even more.</i>

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:02.531
<i>Everywhere is old gold, bronze,</i>
<i>and copper.</i>

01:02:21.132 --> 01:02:23.914
<i>I wish you could see</i>
<i>these lovely days here, Theo.</i>

01:02:23.979 --> 01:02:26.084
<i>But if not, you shall see pictures of them...</i>

01:02:26.155 --> 01:02:29.351
<i>for these colors</i>
<i>give me an extraordinary exultation.</i>

01:02:30.188 --> 01:02:33.286
<i>The whole earth is glowing</i>
<i>under the southern sun.</i>

01:02:33.676 --> 01:02:37.986
<i>Lemon yellow, sulfur yellow,</i>
<i>greenish yellow...</i>

01:02:38.603 --> 01:02:41.025
<i>all under a sky blanched with heat.</i>

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:44.231
<i>What a country it is.</i>

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:47.809
<i>It absorbs me so much</i>
<i>that I let myself go...</i>

01:02:48.395 --> 01:02:50.632
<i>never thinking of a single rule.</i>

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.318
<i>I have no doubts, no limitations.</i>

01:02:53.867 --> 01:02:58.123
<i>I'm working like a steam engine,</i>
<i>devouring paints, burning up canvases.</i>

01:02:58.636 --> 01:03:01.603
<i>Whole days go by</i>
<i>without my speaking to anyone.</i>

01:03:02.027 --> 01:03:05.343
<i>And every day my concentration</i>
<i>becomes more intense...</i>

01:03:05.419 --> 01:03:07.012
<i>my hand more sure.</i>

01:03:07.628 --> 01:03:10.923
<i>I have a power of color in me</i>
<i>that I never had before.</i>

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:13.256
<i>A sense of breadth and strength.</i>

01:03:51.563 --> 01:03:54.214
<i>The summer has vanished</i>
<i>in a fever of work.</i>

01:03:54.283 --> 01:03:56.487
<i>And now the mistral is blowing.</i>

01:03:56.684 --> 01:03:59.651
<i>Always the wind, restless and unceasing.</i>

01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:03.656
<i>Sweeping among the dead leaves</i>
<i>in a rage...</i>

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.563
<i>so that I'm forced to remain indoors.</i>

01:04:07.723 --> 01:04:11.039
<i>Now and then,</i>
<i>when the storm inside me gets too loud...</i>

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:13.701
<i>I take a glass too much to distract me.</i>

01:04:21.323 --> 01:04:24.901
<i>I must watch out for my nerves.</i>
<i>I'm getting haggard, I know.</i>

01:04:25.323 --> 01:04:27.112
<i>If I go on this way...</i>

01:04:27.371 --> 01:04:30.054
<i>some day or other there may be a crisis.</i>

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:32.644
<i>Yet I can't stop.</i>

01:04:36.971 --> 01:04:39.305
<i>Sometimes I work on into the night.</i>

01:04:39.371 --> 01:04:42.186
<i>And I'm hardly conscious</i>
<i>of myself anymore...</i>

01:04:42.891 --> 01:04:47.048
<i>and the pictures come to me</i>
<i>as in a dream, with a terrible lucidity.</i>

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.216
- What time did he get here?
- About 4:00 this morning.

01:06:10.284 --> 01:06:12.837
As usual, two coffees, three absinthes.

01:06:12.908 --> 01:06:15.274
- Did he eat anything?
- What do you think?

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:20.970
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Roulin.

01:06:21.035 --> 01:06:23.075
I brought something for you.
From your brother.

01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:24.969
What I want to know is,
when do I get paid?

01:06:25.036 --> 01:06:28.614
I don't mind carrying him for a day or two,
but this time it's over two weeks.

01:06:28.683 --> 01:06:30.657
I must be as crazy as he is.

01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:33.448
What do you think this is, a reading room?

01:06:39.467 --> 01:06:41.409
- How much does he owe?
- 13 francs.

01:06:41.483 --> 01:06:43.141
Here's 10 francs. Shut up.

01:06:45.483 --> 01:06:48.615
Now. Here, let me give you a hand.
Come along.

01:06:55.723 --> 01:06:58.112
Where were you painting last night?

01:06:58.411 --> 01:07:02.688
We were looking for you everywhere,
all over the place. Couldn't find you.

01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:05.673
- Theo's leaving.
- What?

01:07:06.571 --> 01:07:09.986
No, it's good news. He's getting married.

01:07:10.283 --> 01:07:13.480
That's wonderful.
Let's go right back and celebrate.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:22.759
Do you know the girl?

01:07:23.499 --> 01:07:25.189
She's a Dutch girl.

01:07:25.643 --> 01:07:28.807
He's going to Holland this weekend
to meet her family.

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.566
Mother will be happy.

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:33.963
She's always wanted
one of us to get married.

01:07:36.363 --> 01:07:39.909
When you write your brother,
wish him well from me and my family.

01:07:39.979 --> 01:07:41.353
Yes, I will.

01:07:42.827 --> 01:07:44.136
Thank you.

01:07:47.723 --> 01:07:50.690
"But this doesn't mean
that I don't wish you both happiness...

01:07:50.763 --> 01:07:52.421
"with all my heart.

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:56.651
"With your wife,
you won't be Lonely anymore.

01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:58.914
"Your house won't be empty."

01:07:58.987 --> 01:08:01.223
He must be so alone down there.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.745
You two have always been so close.

01:08:04.939 --> 01:08:07.873
Is there anything we can do, Theo,
to help him?

01:08:08.075 --> 01:08:09.536
I wish I knew.

01:08:09.867 --> 01:08:13.762
If only I could sell something of his.
Just one, that'd be a help.

01:08:14.283 --> 01:08:16.192
Heaven knows I've tried.

01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:19.720
He asks about Gauguin again, too.

01:08:19.787 --> 01:08:22.372
He wants me to persuade him
to go down there.

01:08:22.443 --> 01:08:24.353
- Gauguin?
- It might work.

01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:28.863
When they were here last winter,
they seemed to get on.

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:31.906
Vincent was one of the few people
Paul didn't attack.

01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:33.321
Perhaps if they were together...

01:08:33.386 --> 01:08:37.542
If Vincent could have someone with him,
to whom he could pour out his heart.

01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:39.018
Another painter.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:41.898
- Do you think Gauguin would do it?
- He might.

01:08:43.115 --> 01:08:46.944
I'd have to send him some money.
Enough to pay his debts in Brittany...

01:08:47.019 --> 01:08:48.961
and get him down to Arles.

01:08:50.698 --> 01:08:53.448
It could be the solution for both of them.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:26.433
- Vincent!
- Paul?

01:09:31.147 --> 01:09:34.113
- You're here. You're really here.
- Yes, I'm here.

01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:36.805
You're a day early.
Theo told me you wouldn't come till...

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:39.176
Here, let me take these things.
Come on up, Paul.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:40.901
Did you have trouble finding the place?

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:42.826
Your painting things are here,
and canvases.

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:44.996
They arrived the day before yesterday.

01:09:45.067 --> 01:09:47.587
I fixed this room up for you.

01:10:01.803 --> 01:10:03.712
- It's very nice.
- Thanks.

01:10:16.235 --> 01:10:18.090
I painted them for you.

01:10:20.075 --> 01:10:22.563
That's very friendly of you, Vincent.

01:10:31.115 --> 01:10:32.576
That's very friendly.

01:10:32.715 --> 01:10:34.122
Have you had anything to eat?

01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:36.608
Come on downstairs.
I've got something on the stove.

01:10:36.683 --> 01:10:39.847
I can't wait to see the things
you did in Brittany.

01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:46.147
- I think you'll be interested.
- The way you wrote about them.

01:10:46.219 --> 01:10:49.764
I may have hit something there
I never quite got before.

01:10:49.835 --> 01:10:51.079
Sounds wonderful.

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:53.449
It was all I could do
to keep from opening them up...

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.206
and looking at them.

01:11:02.955 --> 01:11:05.770
- Be ready in just a minute.
- Take your time.

01:11:28.554 --> 01:11:30.464
I see you've been working.

01:11:30.539 --> 01:11:33.473
That's not difficult
in this part of the world.

01:11:33.579 --> 01:11:35.335
- I can't tell you, Paul.
- Yeah.

01:11:35.403 --> 01:11:36.996
You'll see for yourself.

01:11:37.067 --> 01:11:40.929
In the morning, you open the window,
see, there's the green of the gardens.

01:11:41.003 --> 01:11:44.778
Wait till you see the yellow fields at noon
under the full sun.

01:11:45.003 --> 01:11:47.207
And the light, you wouldn't believe it...

01:11:47.307 --> 01:11:49.860
but all the time,
these yellows are really here.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:52.232
Everywhere you look,
there's something to paint.

01:11:52.298 --> 01:11:55.844
What an artist like you would do out here.
We'll go out this afternoon.

01:11:55.915 --> 01:11:59.395
Wait a minute. I'm not one of
those painters that gets off the train...

01:11:59.467 --> 01:12:03.079
and turns out a sunlight effect
before he's even unpacked his bags.

01:12:03.147 --> 01:12:05.864
Paul, show me the Brittany paintings.

01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:09.864
There's plenty of time for that.

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:13.095
- Come on, let's eat.
- All right.

01:12:21.002 --> 01:12:23.075
A little heavy on the turpentine, isn't it?

01:12:23.147 --> 01:12:25.056
What did you do,
boil some old paint tubes?

01:12:25.131 --> 01:12:26.593
Smells like it.

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:29.449
Vincent, from now on
you better let me do the cooking.

01:12:29.515 --> 01:12:30.530
All right.

01:12:30.602 --> 01:12:33.602
Even my worst enemies
won't deny me that talent.

01:12:35.467 --> 01:12:37.321
Do you really have to live like this?

01:12:37.387 --> 01:12:39.688
- What do you mean?
- Look at it. How can you stand it?

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:43.170
Look at the paint in those brushes.
How can you work this way? It's a mess.

01:12:43.243 --> 01:12:45.861
If we're going to live together,
might as well start right.

01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:48.451
- Let's get this place in order.
- Show me the paintings.

01:12:48.523 --> 01:12:49.505
That can wait.

01:12:49.579 --> 01:12:53.572
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's confusion, mental or physical.

01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:09.640
There. Now, this'll have to last us
till the first.

01:13:09.739 --> 01:13:11.975
After that, everything Theo sends us
every month:

01:13:12.043 --> 01:13:14.017
Your allowance,
his advance on my paintings...

01:13:14.091 --> 01:13:16.993
goes into this box.
Anything we spend, we write down.

01:13:17.067 --> 01:13:20.416
So much for food, so much for drink,
for tobacco and other relaxation.

01:13:20.491 --> 01:13:23.938
That way there'll be no more starving
at the end of each month. Understood?

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:25.352
Understood.

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:28.169
I still can't believe you're here.

01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:31.781
Before you came here,
I was a little frightened.

01:13:31.851 --> 01:13:34.087
I'd been alone so long that...

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:37.829
I hope you, too, will find
what you want here, Paul.

01:13:37.898 --> 01:13:39.938
A chance to create in peace.

01:13:40.267 --> 01:13:43.562
This could be just the beginning.
We could get other painters here.

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:47.456
Make a colony of it. A studio of the south,
with you at its head.

01:13:48.235 --> 01:13:50.984
- A Father Superior?
- As its guiding force.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:55.904
I thought maybe we'd ask Bernard
and Lautrec, only he'd never leave Paris.

01:13:56.075 --> 01:13:57.930
- And Signac.
- Haven't you heard?

01:13:57.995 --> 01:14:01.224
I've dismissed Mr. Signac
from the legion of my devoted admirers.

01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:02.468
He bores me.

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:04.327
What about Guillaumin and Seurat?

01:14:04.395 --> 01:14:06.369
- You know what I think of Seurat.
- He's so ill.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.898
- This place would do him good.
- It wouldn't do me good.

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:11.010
I don't want that kind of painting
around me.

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:13.985
Vincent, I've just spent a year
beating my brains out.

01:14:14.059 --> 01:14:16.263
I've sacrificed everything:
Execution, effect...

01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:19.364
all the things that come easiest to me,
for a style.

01:14:19.434 --> 01:14:22.118
A style that'll convey the mood
of what I see...

01:14:22.187 --> 01:14:25.351
the idea, without regard
for concrete reality.

01:14:25.931 --> 01:14:27.273
What do you paint, then?

01:14:27.339 --> 01:14:30.786
What's in my head.
Art's an abstraction, not a picture book.

01:14:30.858 --> 01:14:33.892
A painting is a flat surface
covered with lines and colors...

01:14:33.963 --> 01:14:35.905
arranged in certain order.

01:14:35.979 --> 01:14:39.295
Yeah, but what about the arrangements
that exist in nature?

01:14:39.371 --> 01:14:43.048
I choose to disregard nature.
What I'm after are harmonies...

01:14:43.275 --> 01:14:47.585
harmonies of pure color, deliberately
composed and carefully calculated...

01:14:47.659 --> 01:14:50.026
that move you as music moves you.

01:14:50.091 --> 01:14:52.262
But then you deny
the greatest artists of all:

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:55.178
Rembrandt, Rubens, Delacroix, Millet...

01:14:55.243 --> 01:14:56.421
Millet?

01:14:57.963 --> 01:15:01.640
Millet! That calendar artist
with his dun-colored tones...

01:15:01.707 --> 01:15:05.002
- and sentimental insipidities.
- How dare you say that?

01:15:05.066 --> 01:15:08.743
Millet's one of the few artists
that ever really captured the human spirit.

01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:10.949
Here. In the dignity of toil.

01:15:11.467 --> 01:15:13.671
Millet uses paint
to express the word of God.

01:15:13.739 --> 01:15:15.943
Then he should have been a preacher,
not a painter.

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:19.110
If there's one thing I despise,
it's emotionalism in painting.

01:15:19.179 --> 01:15:23.107
- Vincent, painting is for painters.
- Like your friend Degas, I suppose...

01:15:23.179 --> 01:15:26.375
who's done nothing but ballet dancers
and racehorses for 10 years.

01:15:26.442 --> 01:15:28.384
You can learn from him.
You can learn control!

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:30.825
I don't want control!
I'm not afraid of emotion.

01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:33.858
When I paint the sun,
I want the people to feel it revolving...

01:15:33.931 --> 01:15:35.108
giving off light and heat.

01:15:35.178 --> 01:15:36.160
When I paint a peasant...

01:15:36.234 --> 01:15:39.300
I want to feel the sun pouring into him
like it does into the corn...

01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:41.443
Is that what you do
when you overload your brush?

01:15:41.515 --> 01:15:42.944
When you slap paint on like putty?

01:15:43.018 --> 01:15:44.961
When you make your trees
writhe like snakes...

01:15:45.034 --> 01:15:46.758
and your sun explode all over the canvas?

01:15:46.827 --> 01:15:50.471
What I see when I look at your work
is that you paint too fast!

01:15:50.538 --> 01:15:52.131
You look too fast!

01:15:55.723 --> 01:15:57.763
Whatever you say, brigadier.

01:15:59.915 --> 01:16:01.606
Maybe you're right.

01:16:04.555 --> 01:16:06.595
Maybe we need another drink.

01:16:14.155 --> 01:16:15.715
I'm sorry, Paul.

01:16:24.363 --> 01:16:28.291
Look, Paul, when I painted The Night Café,
I tried to show evil.

01:16:28.363 --> 01:16:30.534
The most violent passions of humanity.

01:16:30.602 --> 01:16:33.155
I painted it blood red and dark yellow.

01:16:34.283 --> 01:16:36.966
And a green billiard table in the middle.

01:16:37.355 --> 01:16:39.111
Four lemon-yellow lamps...

01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:42.528
with a glare of orange and green...

01:16:43.723 --> 01:16:47.335
in an atmosphere of pale sulfur,
like a furnace.

01:16:47.723 --> 01:16:52.033
I tried to show a place
where a man can ruin himself...

01:16:53.802 --> 01:16:55.046
go mad...

01:16:57.226 --> 01:16:58.688
commit a crime.

01:17:04.266 --> 01:17:07.081
What's all of this talk
about Arlesian women?

01:17:07.434 --> 01:17:10.729
- I haven't seen a good one yet.
- They must have heard you were coming...

01:17:10.795 --> 01:17:12.104
- and they locked them up.
- Yeah.

01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:14.626
Wait till you see.
There's something about them...

01:17:14.699 --> 01:17:16.771
the way they carry themselves...

01:17:16.842 --> 01:17:20.420
even the old ones,
a certain classic grace and dignity.

01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:23.305
Dignity? I'm talking about women, man.
Women.

01:17:23.531 --> 01:17:27.622
I like them fat, vicious, and not too smart.
Nothing spiritual, either.

01:17:28.106 --> 01:17:31.140
To have to say "I love you"
would break my teeth.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.465
I don't want to be loved.

01:17:35.915 --> 01:17:37.955
You really mean that, Paul.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:42.951
Let's get out of here.
Show me the rest of the town.

01:18:10.346 --> 01:18:12.353
Wait a minute. Here.

01:18:12.426 --> 01:18:16.136
You pig! Kill him! Tear him apart!

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.346
You pig!

01:18:18.411 --> 01:18:21.160
You didn't tell me the ballet was in town.

01:18:24.683 --> 01:18:27.268
Wait a minute. You're tired.

01:18:36.555 --> 01:18:38.824
There. That's more like it.

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:41.829
Now the town's coming to life.

01:18:44.235 --> 01:18:47.650
Come on. Stop it.
Stop that. Get her out of here.

01:18:48.746 --> 01:18:52.095
And you, I don't want any more trouble
in this place. See?

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:53.893
Come on, now get out.

01:19:03.242 --> 01:19:06.024
I told the Captain
I wouldn't return until tomorrow.

01:19:06.090 --> 01:19:08.479
- Pierre.
- Hello, Vincent, my friend.

01:19:11.978 --> 01:19:14.945
- Hello, redhead. Where have you been?
- Hello, Rachel.

01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:18.334
- I thought you must have gone away.
- I've been working.

01:19:19.243 --> 01:19:21.381
What's the matter?
Don't you like me anymore?

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:22.595
Hi. Buy me a drink?

01:19:22.666 --> 01:19:26.212
My friend's come to town.
I've been getting the place ready for him.

01:19:26.475 --> 01:19:29.475
- That tough?
- No, he's a painter, like me.

01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:33.800
Thanks, sir.

01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:37.416
- He's not like you, redhead.
- Hey, Vincent.

01:19:37.674 --> 01:19:40.970
Look, a masterpiece,
direct from the salons. See?

01:19:41.642 --> 01:19:45.417
Symbolism. Better send it to Theo
before the Louvre grabs it.

01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:48.479
Paul, this is Rachel.

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:54.754
Vincent, why do I do it?

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:58.759
Here I pride myself
on my sense of logic and order...

01:19:59.146 --> 01:20:01.034
and inside I'm a savage.

01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:04.996
I have this attraction to violence.

01:20:06.795 --> 01:20:08.518
Violence makes me sick.

01:20:08.586 --> 01:20:11.008
I have too much inside me. I'm afraid of it.

01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:13.832
That's why I let it out before it hurts me.

01:20:14.634 --> 01:20:16.706
Last winter in Martinique...

01:20:17.066 --> 01:20:21.289
I got into a fight with some sailors.
I was in the hospital for a month.

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:25.028
But it was worth it.
Even that piddling brawl out there...

01:20:25.098 --> 01:20:26.854
made me feel better than I have in weeks.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:27.969
And I know why.

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:30.497
Because suddenly
there's something in front of you...

01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:31.945
something you can hit at.

01:20:32.010 --> 01:20:34.759
He stands there, you smash his teeth in,
or he does it to you.

01:20:34.827 --> 01:20:37.794
Either way, it's all right.
There's a decision.

01:20:38.858 --> 01:20:40.713
- Two absinthes.
- Right away.

01:20:40.778 --> 01:20:42.305
Three absinthes.

01:20:58.922 --> 01:21:01.606
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, brigadier.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:09.666
<i>Dear Theo, I'm so happy</i>
<i>to have Gauguin here.</i>

01:21:10.122 --> 01:21:12.009
<i>Not to be alone anymore.</i>

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:15.201
<i>It's of tremendous value to me</i>
<i>to see him work.</i>

01:21:15.434 --> 01:21:18.533
<i>He's a very great artist, and a good friend.</i>

01:21:19.018 --> 01:21:20.098
Paul.

01:21:21.354 --> 01:21:24.453
It doesn't seem to work. Doesn't work.

01:21:26.154 --> 01:21:28.293
Paul, could you come over
and take a look?

01:21:28.362 --> 01:21:30.980
Vincent, I'm trying to catch this light.

01:21:31.402 --> 01:21:35.396
I remember what you said.
I soften my colors, I try to control them.

01:21:35.914 --> 01:21:38.882
- Then I lose everything.
- Go back and try again.

01:21:39.082 --> 01:21:43.043
That's what I mean.
You see how pale and thin that sky is?

01:21:43.626 --> 01:21:46.277
You use the same brush strokes all over.

01:21:46.379 --> 01:21:50.634
- It's got no texture, no energy. It's all flat.
- That's the way I see it!

01:21:50.794 --> 01:21:51.874
Flat!

01:21:56.618 --> 01:21:59.488
<i>We argue, of course,</i>
<i>mainly about painting.</i>

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:03.330
<i>And our arguments are so electric...</i>

01:22:03.403 --> 01:22:06.599
<i>that I come out of them often</i>
<i>with my brain tired...</i>

01:22:06.666 --> 01:22:08.554
<i>like a run-down battery.</i>

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.055
- What are you nervous about?
- We should be out there working.

01:22:26.122 --> 01:22:27.846
- Look at that sunlight, Gauguin.
- Yeah.

01:22:27.915 --> 01:22:31.264
- Listen to that wind.
- Wind doesn't show in a painting.

01:22:32.363 --> 01:22:35.210
- What about it?
- I'm doing fine right here...

01:22:35.306 --> 01:22:38.153
or I would be if you'd only like some place.

01:22:38.314 --> 01:22:40.420
I'm tired of being cooped up here.

01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:42.662
It wouldn't hurt you to work inside
for once.

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:46.275
- Use your imagination, invent.
- Why should I invent here...

01:22:46.346 --> 01:22:48.550
when nature does it so much better
out there?

01:22:48.618 --> 01:22:51.139
Go out there then, who's stopping you?

01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:17.225
This is ridiculous. I can't work like this!

01:23:17.866 --> 01:23:19.590
Tie down your easel.

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:23.494
No wonder they call you crazy
around here.

01:23:24.714 --> 01:23:26.918
Come on, Vincent, let's get out of here.

01:23:26.986 --> 01:23:29.375
Give it up! You can't paint in this gale.

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:32.484
- I've done it plenty of times.
- Yes, and I've seen the results.

01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:34.496
I'm going back. I'm sick of all this.

01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:38.978
The sun burns the eyes out of your head.
The stinking mistral blows you to pieces.

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:43.426
I'm sick of this whole miserable
countryside. And that house, too.

01:23:43.562 --> 01:23:46.017
I don't know what I'm doing here
or why I ever came.

01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:48.391
If that's the way you feel,
then why don't you leave?

01:23:48.458 --> 01:23:51.905
Do you want to know why?
Because I haven't got the money.

01:23:56.106 --> 01:23:57.928
Paul!

01:24:24.874 --> 01:24:28.355
- Our money from Theo.
- Yeah.

01:24:45.258 --> 01:24:48.324
- Can I pour you a drink, Paul?
- No, thanks.

01:24:58.538 --> 01:25:02.760
Paul, all the way home, I kept thinking...

01:25:04.906 --> 01:25:07.873
I wonder, Paul, if only we'd tried a little.

01:25:08.074 --> 01:25:10.791
If we'd made some effort
to remain friends...

01:25:10.858 --> 01:25:13.225
if it wouldn't have been better
for both of us.

01:25:13.290 --> 01:25:15.112
I see you finished it.

01:25:15.274 --> 01:25:18.056
Yes, because, Paul, when you look back...

01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:21.509
so much of life is wasted in Loneliness.

01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:25.188
There's not one of us
that doesn't need friends...

01:25:26.698 --> 01:25:29.665
companionship, attachments.

01:25:29.738 --> 01:25:33.251
I can do without attachments.
I've learned to avoid them.

01:25:33.802 --> 01:25:37.512
How can you say that, Paul?
I mean, even you have your family.

01:25:37.706 --> 01:25:41.568
Do you ever think of them?
Your children, you see them so seldom.

01:25:41.802 --> 01:25:43.657
Mind your own business.

01:25:43.978 --> 01:25:45.920
Paul, all I mean is that...

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:49.956
you, too, must have times
when you have a terrible...

01:25:50.122 --> 01:25:51.945
Why don't you shut up?

01:25:52.138 --> 01:25:54.822
If you have to slobber, don't do it over me.

01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:57.541
You'll have no trouble finding subjects.

01:25:57.738 --> 01:25:59.877
You mourn over a pair of old shoes.

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:02.564
You cry when you read <i>Uncle Tom 's Cabin.</i>

01:26:02.634 --> 01:26:05.351
You bleed with Millet
over the nobility of toil.

01:26:05.418 --> 01:26:09.193
For weeks I've been listening to that slop,
and I'm tired of it!

01:26:09.514 --> 01:26:11.587
What do you know about toil?

01:26:11.849 --> 01:26:14.981
When have you done
a stroke of manual labor in your life?

01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:19.141
I have. I've dug ditches
in the stinking heat of the Tropics.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:21.249
I've worked on the docks
in weather so cold...

01:26:21.322 --> 01:26:23.231
my hands froze to the ropes.

01:26:23.306 --> 01:26:26.601
And I can tell you there's nothing noble
or beautiful about it.

01:26:26.698 --> 01:26:29.153
I did it so I could go on painting!

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:32.003
I didn't have a brother to support me!

01:26:43.658 --> 01:26:45.600
Don't ever do that again.

01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:49.024
Paul, where are you going?

01:26:49.098 --> 01:26:50.985
I'm getting out
before one of us gets killed.

01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:52.643
- Don't go.
- I'll be back for my things.

01:26:52.714 --> 01:26:55.780
Please don't go. If you only knew
how Lonely I was before you came.

01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:59.331
I know all about Loneliness.
Only, I don't whine about it.

01:29:31.754 --> 01:29:34.787
- What's your name?
- Gauguin.

01:29:44.009 --> 01:29:45.951
Your friend is in there...

01:29:47.786 --> 01:29:48.931
dying.

01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:08.999
- Why haven't you sent for the doctor?
- There's one on the way.

01:30:09.418 --> 01:30:12.767
- What happened?
- His ear's been slashed off.

01:30:16.746 --> 01:30:20.095
- What went on last night?
- I don't know. I wasn't here.

01:30:20.649 --> 01:30:22.078
You live here.

01:30:22.698 --> 01:30:24.323
Why did you leave?

01:30:25.193 --> 01:30:27.615
- Did you two have a fight?
- Look, l...

01:30:27.882 --> 01:30:29.987
Inspector, the doctor's here.

01:30:31.338 --> 01:30:33.727
- Inspector.
- Right this way, Doctor.

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:38.435
- When did you find him?
- About an hour ago.

01:30:38.506 --> 01:30:41.255
- Has he been conscious at all?
- Not at all.

01:30:46.154 --> 01:30:48.325
It's a wonder he didn't bleed to death.

01:30:48.393 --> 01:30:51.044
- Self-inflicted, Doctor?
- Looks that way.

01:30:51.754 --> 01:30:53.128
What do you think, Doc?

01:30:53.193 --> 01:30:56.008
Don't worry. You won't have
a corpse on your hands.

01:30:56.073 --> 01:30:58.976
The thing is to get it cauterized
and cleaned.

01:30:59.274 --> 01:31:02.852
<i>- Gendarme,</i> water and towels, please.
- Right away, sir.

01:31:04.361 --> 01:31:07.045
You might as well know
that man's unbalanced.

01:31:07.114 --> 01:31:09.961
Don't take my word for it.
Ask anyone around.

01:31:10.026 --> 01:31:11.684
Last night, he got worse.

01:31:11.754 --> 01:31:15.070
Just my being here
seemed to drive him out of his mind.

01:31:15.146 --> 01:31:19.456
If I'm here when he comes to,
and he sees me, after all that's happened...

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:21.472
it could be fatal to him.

01:31:22.697 --> 01:31:25.119
Will you need me for anything more?

01:31:26.089 --> 01:31:27.650
No, I guess not.

01:31:28.522 --> 01:31:30.431
I'll notify his brother.

01:31:56.297 --> 01:31:58.120
What do you want here?

01:31:58.186 --> 01:32:01.481
Nothing better to do than hang around
cluttering up the square?

01:32:01.866 --> 01:32:04.287
Why don't you go home
and leave the man alone?

01:32:04.362 --> 01:32:06.434
He's sick and he needs rest!

01:32:07.113 --> 01:32:10.277
This is no sideshow!
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!

01:32:10.345 --> 01:32:11.971
Go on home! Go on!

01:32:42.473 --> 01:32:43.967
Leave me alone!

01:32:44.618 --> 01:32:47.716
- Come on, redhead!
- Leave me alone!

01:32:48.810 --> 01:32:51.395
What happened to the other ear?

01:33:33.194 --> 01:33:35.682
Vincent, I've just been with Dr. Rey.

01:33:35.881 --> 01:33:37.736
You're doing very well.

01:33:38.313 --> 01:33:40.485
Quite soon, now, you'll be able to travel.

01:33:40.554 --> 01:33:42.888
- Johanna and I want you to...
- Theo.

01:33:44.169 --> 01:33:46.438
I want to have myself committed.

01:33:46.601 --> 01:33:48.576
I want to go to an asylum.

01:33:49.641 --> 01:33:51.202
I have to, Theo.

01:33:51.722 --> 01:33:54.143
One more of these attacks
could leave me helpless...

01:33:54.217 --> 01:33:56.104
like a crab on its back.

01:33:57.449 --> 01:33:59.871
Unable even to do away with myself.

01:34:02.954 --> 01:34:06.566
You could come and live with us
in Paris and have a reasonable life.

01:34:06.634 --> 01:34:08.805
I'll see that none of this
ever happens again.

01:34:08.873 --> 01:34:10.182
How, Theo?

01:34:10.249 --> 01:34:13.151
Will you and Johanna
take turns watching me...

01:34:13.641 --> 01:34:16.489
to make sure
the symptoms aren't coming back?

01:34:17.225 --> 01:34:19.167
When your baby's born...

01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:25.218
I'm a danger to others,
I'm a danger to myself.

01:34:26.186 --> 01:34:29.830
Believe me, I'll be better off in an asylum.

01:34:30.282 --> 01:34:33.446
Vincent, don't. You mustn't think like that.

01:34:34.697 --> 01:34:37.064
Find a place for me to go. Please.

01:34:41.161 --> 01:34:44.477
Don't be sad. It won't be for long.

01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:49.603
Just long enough for me
to find a little order in my life.

01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:51.584
A little peace.

01:35:45.705 --> 01:35:48.902
Yes, your brother has stated the case
most clearly...

01:35:48.969 --> 01:35:52.831
including the fact that you have
voluntarily committed yourself here.

01:35:52.905 --> 01:35:56.418
Now, you know, mental disease
is no different from any other ailment...

01:35:56.489 --> 01:35:57.831
you might have contracted.

01:35:57.898 --> 01:36:00.898
And these hallucinations you speak of,
once you recognize them...

01:36:00.970 --> 01:36:03.686
as the normal accompaniment
of disturbances of this sort...

01:36:03.754 --> 01:36:06.241
whether congenital or acquired...

01:36:06.313 --> 01:36:10.405
once you accept your state for what it is,
half the terror has gone out of it.

01:36:10.474 --> 01:36:12.448
- You do see that, don't you?
- Of course.

01:36:13.545 --> 01:36:16.066
Beyond that, peace and rest.

01:36:16.138 --> 01:36:19.399
Regular routine in agreeable surroundings.

01:36:19.722 --> 01:36:22.951
You know, in this entire institution
at the moment...

01:36:23.017 --> 01:36:25.635
we've no more than11 male patients.

01:36:26.505 --> 01:36:29.636
The food is plain but healthy.

01:36:29.705 --> 01:36:32.705
And above all, it is quiet. Yes.

01:36:33.674 --> 01:36:35.332
Yes, it is quiet.

01:36:37.514 --> 01:36:39.935
Now, here is our superintendent.

01:36:40.329 --> 01:36:43.526
And this is Mr. Vincent van Gogh
from Holland.

01:36:43.593 --> 01:36:45.960
Now, why don't you
take Mr. Van Gogh to his room...

01:36:46.025 --> 01:36:48.229
and let him know
some of our rules and habits.

01:36:48.297 --> 01:36:51.810
No, we'll store those away for you
for a little while...

01:36:51.881 --> 01:36:54.565
until you see what you need. Yes.

01:36:55.498 --> 01:36:57.865
Meanwhile, any time you need me...

01:37:16.874 --> 01:37:18.816
...mutilated his left ear.

01:37:20.041 --> 01:37:21.896
In view of the above...

01:37:23.017 --> 01:37:26.181
and in the light of my examination
of the patient...

01:37:27.305 --> 01:37:29.574
it is my professional opinion...

01:37:29.802 --> 01:37:32.616
<i>that it will be necessary</i>
<i>for Mr. Van Gogh...</i>

01:37:32.842 --> 01:37:36.387
<i>to undergo extended observation</i>
<i>and treatment...</i>

01:37:36.905 --> 01:37:38.596
<i>in this institution.</i>

01:37:38.665 --> 01:37:42.658
<i>Signed, Dr. Peyron,</i>
<i>dated Saint-Rémy, May 9, 1889.</i>

01:37:45.674 --> 01:37:49.187
Van Gogh, Vincent, June 14.

01:37:49.993 --> 01:37:52.960
The patient's condition
appears satisfactory...

01:37:53.321 --> 01:37:55.361
with continued improvement.

01:37:57.577 --> 01:38:02.116
Continues to suffer, however,
from a condition of chronic inertia...

01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:05.761
<i>accompanied by symptoms</i>
<i>of extreme terror.</i>

01:38:10.825 --> 01:38:13.346
Would you like me to open the window?

01:38:21.993 --> 01:38:24.132
The view is lovely from here.

01:38:36.457 --> 01:38:39.773
General condition of patient: Fair.

01:38:44.009 --> 01:38:45.351
Non-violent.

01:38:48.457 --> 01:38:51.425
<i>He has requested</i>
<i>that his painting equipment...</i>

01:38:51.593 --> 01:38:53.633
<i>and other personal effects...</i>

01:38:53.705 --> 01:38:55.494
<i>be placed in his room.</i>

01:38:55.689 --> 01:38:57.250
<i>Request granted.</i>

01:39:37.257 --> 01:39:38.751
It's beautiful.

01:39:40.969 --> 01:39:45.160
But the mower? Is he imaginary?
There's no one in that field.

01:39:45.577 --> 01:39:49.286
That's just any man struggling in the heat
to finish his work.

01:39:50.441 --> 01:39:52.416
It's the figure of death.

01:39:56.617 --> 01:40:00.327
- It doesn't seem a sad death.
- It's not, Sister.

01:40:01.034 --> 01:40:03.489
It happens in the bright daylight...

01:40:04.009 --> 01:40:07.970
with the sun flooding everything
in a light of pure gold.

01:40:19.274 --> 01:40:23.267
It would appear
that painting is beneficial...

01:40:24.297 --> 01:40:26.599
perhaps even necessary...

01:40:27.497 --> 01:40:29.636
<i>for this patient's well-being.</i>

01:40:31.145 --> 01:40:32.738
<i>Provided, of course...</i>

01:40:32.809 --> 01:40:35.265
<i>that he is not permitted to indulge...</i>

01:40:35.337 --> 01:40:38.599
<i>in those excesses of work and emotion...</i>

01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:42.208
<i>that induced his former crisis.</i>

01:41:41.769 --> 01:41:45.959
This latest seizure was the most severe...

01:41:47.273 --> 01:41:48.767
and prolonged...

01:41:49.129 --> 01:41:51.976
that your brother has suffered to date.

01:41:53.705 --> 01:41:58.277
As a result of constant attention...

01:41:59.561 --> 01:42:01.187
and observation...

01:42:01.481 --> 01:42:05.093
he is today approaching physical recovery.

01:42:05.321 --> 01:42:09.926
He now expresses the desire
to leave this institution...

01:42:11.657 --> 01:42:14.918
with the intention of taking up residence
in the north.

01:42:16.649 --> 01:42:20.031
And since you support him...

01:42:20.713 --> 01:42:22.339
in this request...

01:42:26.409 --> 01:42:28.318
he will be discharged...

01:42:29.321 --> 01:42:31.394
as soon as he is considered fit to travel.

01:42:47.241 --> 01:42:49.412
- Vincent.
- Hello, Johanna.

01:42:51.145 --> 01:42:53.731
- It's good to see you.
- It's about time.

01:42:54.889 --> 01:42:57.093
You're just as pretty as I thought you'd be.

01:42:57.161 --> 01:42:58.950
Don't you think he looks well, Theo?

01:42:59.017 --> 01:43:01.089
- He looks better than I do.
- Where's that baby?

01:43:01.161 --> 01:43:03.430
- When do I get to see him?
- He's asleep...

01:43:03.497 --> 01:43:05.952
but since he's your namesake,
you can go in.

01:43:06.025 --> 01:43:07.618
You try and keep me out.

01:43:07.689 --> 01:43:10.558
I brought him a little present.
I hope he likes it.

01:43:10.633 --> 01:43:13.600
- There's your nephew.
- He's a real van Gogh.

01:43:13.705 --> 01:43:17.021
When Willemien was here, she said
he looked more like Father than anyone.

01:43:17.097 --> 01:43:19.715
No, there's some of Johanna in him.
Look at those hands...

01:43:19.785 --> 01:43:23.614
- and see how well-behaved he is.
- Just wait till he gets hungry.

01:43:24.681 --> 01:43:27.201
Vincent! Are you all right?

01:43:28.233 --> 01:43:29.695
Come sit down.

01:43:30.761 --> 01:43:32.485
You'll be all right.

01:43:34.025 --> 01:43:37.637
I'm fine. I was dizzy for a moment.

01:43:38.569 --> 01:43:40.936
- You're tired.
- I'll get you some coffee.

01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:42.561
Thanks, Johanna.

01:43:43.625 --> 01:43:46.374
I'm all right, really. It was a long trip.

01:43:49.641 --> 01:43:52.292
I left the best news until you got here.

01:43:52.521 --> 01:43:55.270
- Your painting of The Red Vineyard.
- What about it?

01:43:55.337 --> 01:43:57.344
It sold for 400 francs.

01:43:57.417 --> 01:43:58.846
Who bought it?

01:43:59.337 --> 01:44:02.653
A painter. Anna Bock.
She lives in Brussels.

01:44:02.761 --> 01:44:04.866
That's fine. I'm glad...

01:44:09.321 --> 01:44:12.289
Theo, I had no idea
I'd sent you so much stuff.

01:44:14.473 --> 01:44:16.229
It certainly adds up.

01:44:17.545 --> 01:44:20.065
I've hardly given you room
to move around.

01:44:20.136 --> 01:44:23.038
We still have some space
to squeeze a few people in here.

01:44:23.113 --> 01:44:27.270
As a matter of fact, I was thinking of
asking some of your friends over tonight.

01:44:27.529 --> 01:44:30.082
- Where's Paul?
- He's in Brittany.

01:44:30.313 --> 01:44:33.160
But Lautrec, Pissarro, Bernard,
they want to see you.

01:44:33.224 --> 01:44:35.646
We ought to celebrate your first sale.

01:44:35.721 --> 01:44:37.761
Or would you rather leave it till later?

01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:39.458
No, make it tonight.

01:44:39.529 --> 01:44:42.878
I think the sooner I get settled in Auvers,
the better.

01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:45.832
It isn't as if I were going a long ways off.

01:44:45.897 --> 01:44:48.864
Why, you can all come out and see me
on Sunday.

01:44:49.288 --> 01:44:52.867
Is everything set there with Dr. Gachet?

01:44:52.937 --> 01:44:55.424
- Is he expecting me?
- Pissarro made all the arrangements.

01:44:55.497 --> 01:44:57.058
They were here together last week.

01:44:57.129 --> 01:45:00.325
- Did they see my new things?
- Gachet got so excited.

01:45:00.745 --> 01:45:03.647
He wouldn't leave
until I'd lent him a couple.

01:45:07.689 --> 01:45:11.365
- Did you explain to him about me?
- Yes, Vincent, I did.

01:45:11.561 --> 01:45:13.449
He seems very confident.

01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:17.089
Thanks, Johanna. Good Dutch cookies.

01:45:18.217 --> 01:45:21.861
I don't understand you, Theo. With such
fine Dutch cooking in the house...

01:45:21.928 --> 01:45:25.922
you know it's about time you
put some flesh on those bones of yours.

01:45:26.697 --> 01:45:30.591
I'm really very hopeful, Vincent.
Dr. Gachet's got a very good name...

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:32.002
<i>and he says that...</i>

01:45:33.608 --> 01:45:35.878
Dr. Gachet, you see,
that's what I have to know.

01:45:35.945 --> 01:45:38.181
Will there be a warning?
Will I have time to...

01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:41.150
About those seizures of yours,
do you want my opinion?

01:45:41.225 --> 01:45:45.000
Forget them, completely.
Tell yourself you're finished with them...

01:45:45.065 --> 01:45:47.553
and work boldly and joyously.

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.464
Vincent, you don't know
how lucky you are.

01:45:50.536 --> 01:45:53.253
To have done one painting
like that cypress in there...

01:45:53.321 --> 01:45:55.688
or those sunflowers
that your brother showed me...

01:45:55.753 --> 01:45:57.640
I'd give 10 years of my life.

01:45:57.704 --> 01:46:01.185
- Don't you like your wine?
- I don't drink much these days.

01:46:02.217 --> 01:46:05.381
Yes, for a painter,
work is the only medicine there is.

01:46:05.449 --> 01:46:07.554
And this is the place for it.

01:46:08.137 --> 01:46:09.315
Come in.

01:46:10.601 --> 01:46:12.706
Cézanne's. Do you recognize it?

01:46:12.937 --> 01:46:14.725
He painted it right in this room...

01:46:14.793 --> 01:46:17.542
and that is this house.

01:46:18.185 --> 01:46:20.738
He painted that from across the street.

01:46:20.809 --> 01:46:24.005
Yes, as a matter of fact,
there's hardly a canvas here...

01:46:24.073 --> 01:46:27.848
that wasn't done right in this house
or within 100 yards of it.

01:46:27.913 --> 01:46:30.630
Have you seen this Daumier?
It's a wonder.

01:46:32.937 --> 01:46:34.530
Strong, isn't it?

01:46:35.561 --> 01:46:38.114
Yes, he came here many times, Daumier.

01:46:38.697 --> 01:46:40.453
He was a strange one.

01:46:40.745 --> 01:46:42.949
So, you see, when I tell you...

01:46:43.017 --> 01:46:45.887
that I understand
the artistic temperament...

01:46:47.016 --> 01:46:51.173
When Manet was dying,
they called me in for consultation.

01:46:52.201 --> 01:46:53.989
They wanted to amputate.

01:46:54.057 --> 01:46:57.886
I said no. No, not for a man like that.

01:46:57.961 --> 01:46:59.390
But they wouldn't listen.

01:46:59.465 --> 01:47:01.352
- Lunch is served, Doctor.
- Good, Therese.

01:47:01.416 --> 01:47:03.685
You can put it on the table now.
We'll be right out.

01:47:03.752 --> 01:47:04.701
Yes, sir.

01:47:04.777 --> 01:47:07.297
- Guillaumin.
- It's a beauty, isn't it?

01:47:07.432 --> 01:47:10.466
If you like, I'll take you out
and show you where he painted it.

01:47:10.537 --> 01:47:12.871
I wanted him to join us at Arles.

01:47:13.096 --> 01:47:14.722
- Look, it's warped.
- Is it?

01:47:14.793 --> 01:47:16.768
You better have it framed.

01:47:17.544 --> 01:47:21.025
I was meaning to take it in. I will.
I'll do it tomorrow.

01:47:25.513 --> 01:47:28.066
<i>Dear Theo, I've seen Dr. Gachet.</i>

01:47:28.329 --> 01:47:31.809
<i>He's a pleasant man.</i>
<i>He has some good paintings in his house.</i>

01:47:31.881 --> 01:47:34.118
<i>He wants me to do his portrait.</i>

01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:37.379
<i>But as for his helping me...</i>

01:47:38.121 --> 01:47:40.771
<i>I'm afraid we mustn't hope for too much.</i>

01:47:42.088 --> 01:47:44.357
<i>When the blind lead the blind...</i>

01:47:45.032 --> 01:47:46.691
<i>don't they both fall in the ditch?</i>

01:47:47.912 --> 01:47:52.484
Mr. Vincent, at what time would you like
to have your breakfast in the morning?

01:47:52.585 --> 01:47:56.130
Don't worry about that.
I'll be out early, before you get up.

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.812
Just leave some bread
and some cold coffee. That'll be fine.

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.376
<i>Gachet is right about one thing.</i>
<i>This place is beautiful.</i>

01:48:06.088 --> 01:48:08.510
<i>It tempts me to paint</i>
<i>and the work goes well.</i>

01:48:08.585 --> 01:48:12.545
You'd think being a doctor,
seeing so much of pain and suffering...

01:48:12.616 --> 01:48:14.918
that I've got problems enough
for one man.

01:48:14.984 --> 01:48:16.129
But, no.

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:19.997
I go around founding societies
and joining groups...

01:48:20.585 --> 01:48:23.138
and then this passion of mine for art.

01:48:23.624 --> 01:48:26.755
<i>Besides portraits,</i>
<i>I've been doing some landscapes.</i>

01:48:26.889 --> 01:48:31.362
<i>I have a feeling of being</i>
<i>surer of my brush than ever before.</i>

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:35.421
<i>So I work in haste from day to day...</i>

01:48:36.137 --> 01:48:39.333
<i>as a miner does</i>
<i>who knows he's facing disaster.</i>

01:49:55.401 --> 01:49:57.343
<i>Vive Monsieur le maire!</i>

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:49.729
It's impossible.

01:53:10.024 --> 01:53:12.642
I can make a joke
of this whole sorry business...

01:53:12.712 --> 01:53:15.582
if it wasn't for the trouble I've caused you.

01:53:18.344 --> 01:53:22.784
If you'd at least have gotten back
the cost of paint and the canvas.

01:53:24.328 --> 01:53:25.790
Doesn't matter.

01:53:27.304 --> 01:53:29.955
- Is the baby really better?
- Yes.

01:53:31.592 --> 01:53:33.152
We were worried about nothing.

01:53:33.224 --> 01:53:36.290
He was just teething.
That was all of his trouble.

01:53:37.288 --> 01:53:41.314
I only hope he has a quieter soul
than mine...

01:53:42.281 --> 01:53:44.069
'cause mine's sinking.

01:53:46.281 --> 01:53:47.458
Sinking.

01:53:51.496 --> 01:53:53.056
Theo?

01:53:58.024 --> 01:53:59.748
I'd like to go home.

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:20.734
My own brother.

01:54:22.024 --> 01:54:23.846
My poor, poor brother.

01:54:27.976 --> 01:54:32.002
<i>- It doesn't seem a sad death.</i>
<i>- It's not, Sister.</i>

01:54:32.776 --> 01:54:34.816
<i>It happens in the bright daylight...</i>

01:54:34.888 --> 01:54:38.303
<i>with the sun flooding everything</i>
<i>in a light of pure gold.</i>

01:54:39.305 --> 01:54:45.491
