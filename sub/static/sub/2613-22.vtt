00:15.048 --> 00:20.008
(loud rock music playing)

00:45.412 --> 00:46.246
(laughing)

00:46.246 --> 00:48.681
We should have
these parties more than once a month.

00:48.681 --> 00:51.217
I would, but Mina
tends to get jealous.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.218
I love you, Chief,

00:52.218 --> 00:56.423
but if anybody should
be jealous, it's you.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.384
(laughs)

00:59.893 --> 01:01.161
Who's that guy?

01:01.161 --> 01:02.429
Hey, Chief...

01:02.429 --> 01:04.763
I didn't know you
were into guys, too.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.231
What guy?

01:45.038 --> 01:46.972
(two gunshots)

01:51.845 --> 01:53.608
Daddy?

02:15.535 --> 02:18.204
So, two nights ago,
he has a party.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.808
High-end guest list,
very private.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.477
That was the last
anyone saw of him.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.468
Housekeeper arrives
20 minutes ago.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.811
This is
what she found.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.459
Ex- Chief of Detectives.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.427
Left to make the big bucks.

02:41.427 --> 02:46.065
Consulting to the security
at every major casino in town,

02:46.065 --> 02:48.034
and couldn't even
protect himself.

02:48.034 --> 02:52.266
There's only one interpretation
for this:

02:53.306 --> 02:55.171
"Kill the pig."

02:55.909 --> 02:59.140
And what about
the rest of his family?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.147
No sign of the wife.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.149
What about the daughter?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.852
Housekeeper assume d that she spent the

03:05.852 --> 03:07.843
Assumed?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.043
She's gone.

04:02.642 --> 04:06.203
His wife and daughter
are missing.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.238
His silver Cadillac DTS
is also missing.

04:09.282 --> 04:12.217
We're looking for any
signs of forced entry
in the house,

04:12.252 --> 04:16.122
- any signs of ransack that's not associated

04:16.122 --> 04:18.214
We need serious damage control. When

04:18.257 --> 04:21.594
it's going to be bad for morale all around.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.222
- I'll take the downstairs. - Yeah, I'll be

04:24.264 --> 04:26.232
Looks execution - style.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.234
At least one shot
to the back of the head.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.371
A lot of bruising
around these handcuffs.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.236
So he probably
fought back.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.241
Without a doubt.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.266
Found a shell casing.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.279
Looks like one of ours.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.942
Nine- millimeter,
standard issue.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.688
So where do you suppose
the chief keeps his gun safe?

04:48.688 --> 04:50.781
(drilling)

05:10.643 --> 05:12.406
We're in.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.517
Thank you, Scott.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.152
No problem.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.814
What do you got?

05:25.091 --> 05:27.616
.38.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.096
Nice.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.432
Pearl handle.25.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.166
Clear?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.827
I'm looking forthat.9.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.312
So you think the
chief might've kept

05:47.347 --> 05:48.147
his signature piece
someplace else?

05:48.147 --> 05:52.083
"For 25 years of
distinguished service."

05:52.352 --> 05:57.223
An honor like that.
Keep it in the case.

05:57.223 --> 05:57.790
Yeah.

05:57.790 --> 06:01.317
So I'm thinking that
the wife might be in on this.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.895
Why didn't
she plan better?

06:02.895 --> 06:04.328
Pack the
kid's clothes.
What?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.332
The nanny told
me that she only
took one shirt...

06:06.366 --> 06:08.334
one the kid
wouldn't even wear.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.336
Security guard. No party list,

06:10.336 --> 06:13.328
but he did see each car that left the night of

06:13.373 --> 06:16.342
Chief Rittle left
around 5:00 a.m.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.340
5:14, to be exact.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.484
You saw
Chief Rittle leave?

06:24.484 --> 06:27.078
Yeah. He was with
his wife and kid.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.350
And he had his baseball cap
and sunglasses on,

06:29.389 --> 06:30.390
like he always does.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.126
So you saw a baseball cap
and sunglasses.
(cell phone rings)

06:33.126 --> 06:35.061
Did you actually
see the chief's face?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.358
Well...

06:36.396 --> 06:38.364
actually, I didn't.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.727
Brass found the
chief's Cadillac.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.360
Who found it?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.371
In-house security.
Blue jacket.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.373
First time he saw
the car was Saturday.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.342
Chalk ed the tires twice.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.444
Saw the bulletin on
the chief and called us.

06:51.444 --> 06:52.512
Any bodies, Joe?

06:52.512 --> 06:54.781
I already checked
inside the car.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.648
We're waiting on you
to check the trunk.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.655
(cell phone rings)

07:02.655 --> 07:03.990
Whoa.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.625
Excuse me.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.752
Who is this?

07:16.102 --> 07:16.836
"Chief Rittle"?

07:16.836 --> 07:19.872
What is his connection
to the chief?

07:19.872 --> 07:20.640
I don't know.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.209
But, if he has gunpowder
residue on him,

07:23.209 --> 07:25.404
could be our shooter.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.413
Okay.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.075
Florida Highway
Patrol called.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.653
Several motorists
saw a girl matching Sasha's exact physical

07:33.653 --> 07:35.488
walking along an access road.

07:35.488 --> 07:36.489
In Florida?

07:36.489 --> 07:38.423
Miami - Dade County.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.293
Chief was shot Friday night.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.229
It's a two-day drive
if you don't stop.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.424
It's national news with national attention.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.567
I'm not surprised
we're getting call-ins.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.559
Well, if it is our little girl, she's got evidence
on her

07:51.571 --> 07:55.063
One of us should be down there to

07:57.376 --> 08:01.437
Take Warrick.
I don't think he's
ever been to Florida.

08:10.556 --> 08:11.991
She's seven years old!

08:11.991 --> 08:13.993
She's wearing a pink shirt!

08:13.993 --> 08:17.063
She was last seen
by a motorist there!

08:17.063 --> 08:20.132
She can be two kilometers
in either direction.

08:20.132 --> 08:23.402
Think of this area
as a quadrant. Divide up.

08:23.402 --> 08:25.037
You, north.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.606
You, south.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.005
Got it!

09:03.142 --> 09:04.336
(squeals)

09:07.179 --> 09:09.807
(squealing)

09:47.620 --> 09:49.349
Sasha?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.821
Sasha?

09:57.663 --> 10:00.257
My name is Horatio Caine.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.561
I'm the head of the Crime Unit.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.262
Horatio?

10:03.302 --> 10:04.564
Yeah.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.572
That's a funny name,
isn't it?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.607
My mother named me

10:07.607 --> 10:10.176
after a famous writer
named Horatio Alger.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.576
Ever hear of him?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.580
Is your badge real?

10:14.614 --> 10:15.581
Yeah.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.106
Yeah, that's real.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.356
My daddy's a policeman.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.359
I know that.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.883
I knew that.

10:28.928 --> 10:32.531
They're looking for me,
you know.

10:32.531 --> 10:36.035
Me, too. Me, too.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.639
What do you say we sit here

10:39.639 --> 10:42.130
and get found together?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.412
(sighs)

10:51.283 --> 10:53.251
What a day.

10:57.189 --> 11:01.160
(helicopter whirring)

11:01.160 --> 11:03.329
Burgundy sedan.
Caucasian female.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.198
Age 32. Traveling
with a Caucasian male,

11:06.198 --> 11:07.199
indeterminate age.

11:07.199 --> 11:08.467
I got a female in distress.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.170
I want the APB to
extend to the whole state.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.939
Panhandle to the Keys.
Yes, sir.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.167
Good.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.423
Horatio Caine.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.424
Catherine Willows.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.224
Caine.
Brown.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.093
Child Services has
sent a doctor out.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.828
All right,
let's just be clear.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.659
This is a Las Vegas case.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.665
This is our victim,
and we do the processing.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.101
Okay, I didn't say he processed her. I just

11:42.101 --> 11:43.869
I appreciate the respect.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.104
You sure about that?

11:45.104 --> 11:47.073
Does she know
about her father?

11:47.073 --> 11:48.140
Not yet.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.009
Well, I'd like
to get started processing.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.243
Can you show me
where you found her?

11:51.243 --> 11:53.045
Okay, I found her
right in here. And...

11:53.045 --> 11:56.139
this is the young lady
right over here.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.619
Hi, Sasha.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.421
I'm Catherine Willows.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.723
And...

12:03.723 --> 12:07.359
I need to ask you
a few questions.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.951
Okay?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.498
My kit.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.166
Did the man touch you?

12:14.166 --> 12:17.135
He hit my mommy.

12:20.172 --> 12:22.041
Did he hit you?

12:22.041 --> 12:24.043
Did he hurt you
in any way?

12:24.043 --> 12:26.345
He acted like
I wasn't there.

12:26.345 --> 12:31.715
Well, you know what
always happens to
bad people?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.720
They leave behind
a part of themselves,

12:34.754 --> 12:37.723
and that's how you can
help us find your mommy.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.726
Now, I need to look underneath your

12:46.766 --> 12:48.757
You want to show me
what's in your hand?

12:49.835 --> 12:51.666
It's okay.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.742
Where did you get that?

13:01.313 --> 13:04.578
Go! Run, Sasha, run!

13:05.785 --> 13:09.585
I ran out after they drove off.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.692
I picked that up.

13:13.692 --> 13:16.295
I bet it felt cold
when you picked it up.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.431
No.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.233
No... hot.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.335
Hmm.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.703
You're trick ing me.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.365
You're too smart for that.

13:28.307 --> 13:31.177
You can spot a Glock cartridge
from a block away:

13:31.177 --> 13:33.345
Rectangular
firing pin impression,

13:33.345 --> 13:34.914
breach face shear.

13:34.914 --> 13:35.815
This casing's no Glock.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.849
It's isn't
your chief's weapon.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.485
Well, whoever this guy
is, he's a lousy shot.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.544
Five casings, no hits.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.889
Oh, by the way,
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.789
Don't ask me how
to spell it. Southern.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.227
Catherine Willows.
Southern... Nevada.

13:48.227 --> 13:50.196
You got a theory on how the mother and

13:50.196 --> 13:52.498
all the way in Miami
from Las Vegas?

13:52.498 --> 13:54.834
Well, we don't actually
work theories. Do we, Warrick?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.802
No, just evidence.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.138
We're much more
fanciful down here.

13:59.138 --> 13:59.972
Aren't we, Horatio?

13:59.972 --> 14:01.740
I think that's a
fair description.

14:01.740 --> 14:05.444
My guess is, this belongs
to a Taurus 9, made in Brazil. It's a cheap

14:05.444 --> 14:07.780
and you may not see
many of them in Vegas,

14:07.780 --> 14:09.715
but we get them down here
all the time.

14:09.715 --> 14:13.352
Which makes me think this guy
wasn't fleeing Las Vegas.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.621
He was coming home to Miami.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.590
Well, it's no longer
"Trunk Man."

14:17.590 --> 14:20.025
Identified him
from his dental records.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.825
Jason Doyle. Dead
for three days; no GSR.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.532
So, I guess he
didn't shoot Rittle.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.763
We only recovered one
slug from his cranium.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.838
And I got this fragment from his lower back.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.840
His lower back?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.842
I thought he was shot
twice in the head.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.410
Vascular embolization.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.412
Bullet got into his
arterial system.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.845
That's rare.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.282
Well, it took a
full-body X ray for me to find the thing.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.849
Bullet entered here,

14:47.887 --> 14:49.878
fragmenting at the neck,

14:50.222 --> 14:53.726
and losing velocity upon penetration of the

14:53.726 --> 14:56.595
Tube down the aorta,
continually losing momentum.

14:56.595 --> 14:59.798
As it exit ed the aorta,
it struck the vertebral column

14:59.798 --> 15:02.768
and then was swept down
to the base of the aorta

15:02.768 --> 15:05.838
where I recovered it
here at the lumbar region.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.473
(huffs)

15:07.473 --> 15:08.774
Pinball.

15:08.774 --> 15:11.644
Looks like nines...
like we found in the chief.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.445
I'll call Catherine. Thanks.

15:13.445 --> 15:14.912
Yeah.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.485
Hey, Nick.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.052
Mm-hmm?

15:20.052 --> 15:22.213
You ever been
to a swingers' party?

15:23.589 --> 15:26.292
Well, if it's the same
thing as a frat party,

15:26.292 --> 15:27.884
yeah, lots of them.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.590
You know, you get
enough booze going, things can
get pretty wild.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.966
Frat party, huh?

15:33.966 --> 15:37.026
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.135
How wild?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.611
Multiple-partner wild.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.945
And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe
three

15:50.950 --> 15:53.783
Hit on the rock glass.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.254
Work card.

15:55.254 --> 15:58.490
"Orpheus Hotel. Tiffany Langer."

15:58.490 --> 15:59.825
Who's she?

15:59.825 --> 16:01.759
Showgirl.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.925
Yes, I went to the party.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.932
No, I didn't go alone.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.957
And, no, I'm not telling you

16:09.001 --> 16:10.935
my date's name
or anyone else who was there.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.961
These people
are important.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.676
Well, a very important
police officer was murdered there.

16:17.676 --> 16:18.938
I don't care.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.213
It took me a long time
to get into the circle,

16:21.213 --> 16:22.614
and I plan
on staying there.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.984
Was there anybody there
you didn't know?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.086
Anybody who wasn't
in "the circle"?

16:27.086 --> 16:29.154
Well, my date.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.155
Do you know where he is?

16:30.155 --> 16:32.391
I haven't seen him
since that night.

16:32.391 --> 16:35.594
He sent me home
with a judge and his wife.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.196
So... your date

16:37.196 --> 16:39.960
stayed at the party
after you left?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.660
As far as I know.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.268
Where does he live?

16:43.268 --> 16:44.003
I don't know.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.971
I've known him for five days.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.973
Well, that's 120 hours.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.677
There must be something
you know about him that you could share

16:51.677 --> 16:55.614
Right-handed, a Libra,
circumcised, rich...

16:55.614 --> 16:57.516
Back-East rich.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.384
Which kind of surprised me

16:58.384 --> 17:00.519
because he wore
really cheap cologne.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.655
Cheap? How?

17:03.655 --> 17:06.525
Smelled funny... sweet.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.127
Are you sure it was cologne?

17:08.127 --> 17:10.695
Or deodorant. Mouthwash, maybe

17:10.695 --> 17:14.996
All I know is
it smelled sickly sweet.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.369
To be honest, I thought he could
have used a little help in that department.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.406
Would you happen to have

17:20.406 --> 17:22.708
an article of clothing
of his by any chance?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.310
The only thing he gave me
was a good time.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.712
Hey, guess what?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.009
This isn't about you.

17:28.047 --> 17:32.006
This is about a missing
seven-year-old girl.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.587
Why don't you give us his name?

17:37.056 --> 17:40.719
Adam Van der Welk.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.730
Uh... no, the chief's little
girl is with Child Services.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.932
We're still
at the drop-off place.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.068
Yeah, right. Will do, Brass.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.036
I got a pill.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.061
Looks like a sedative.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.005
Okay.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.947
Diazapam.

18:01.947 --> 18:02.881
Benzos.

18:02.881 --> 18:04.383
That could explain
why the mother

18:04.383 --> 18:06.085
didn't escape
with her daughter.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.882
She was incapacitated.

18:09.855 --> 18:10.355
Go!

18:10.355 --> 18:13.192
How'd the little girl get away?

18:13.192 --> 18:16.161
We got some tire treads
on the shoulder.

18:16.161 --> 18:16.995
Made an easy stop.

18:16.995 --> 18:20.032
And why did he pick
such a secluded area?

18:20.032 --> 18:22.968
Seems like a great place
to ice someone.

18:22.968 --> 18:23.702
Or take a leak.

18:23.702 --> 18:27.968
Maybe that's why he stopped
the car here... to take a leak.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.777
Run! Run, Sasha, run!

18:33.779 --> 18:36.077
Let me ask you another question:

18:36.115 --> 18:38.383
When you're home alone, do you lock the

18:38.383 --> 18:40.408
I don't
even know you.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.720
Sure, you do. We all do.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.756
It's human nature
to avoid being
vulnerable, isn't it?

18:44.756 --> 18:46.158
So, if that's the case,

18:46.158 --> 18:48.794
then he would look for a tree

18:48.794 --> 18:51.388
to shield himself,
wouldn't he?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.100
So, then the question becomes,

18:55.134 --> 18:59.071
how far along this path
before he loses sight of them?

18:59.071 --> 19:01.273
Not very far.

19:01.273 --> 19:02.374
Look at this.

19:02.374 --> 19:05.036
Bang. Footprints...

19:05.344 --> 19:08.541
and this is urine.

19:10.749 --> 19:14.583
If you're lucky, urethral cells
with slough off with urine.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.423
But, if we get his DNA,

19:18.423 --> 19:20.292
there's a chance
we'll get
him.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.760
(cell phone rings)

19:21.760 --> 19:23.328
Yeah. Caine.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.819
What do you mean, FBI?

19:29.535 --> 19:31.970
So you're saying the guy has B.O.?

19:31.970 --> 19:34.006
Body odor, bad breath.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.675
I don't know; there's something
about Adam Van der Welk

19:36.675 --> 19:37.543
that makes him smell.

19:37.543 --> 19:41.680
All this because some showgirl
said he smelled sweet?

19:41.680 --> 19:42.347
Sickly sweet.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.850
Smells can be like fingerprints,
my dear.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.318
Hey, what's going on there?

19:46.318 --> 19:48.520
I thought you were
meeting the Feds?

19:48.520 --> 19:51.023
Uh... yeah, we are.
They picked the place.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.191
The Shore Club.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.182
Later.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.461
What's taking
so long?

19:56.461 --> 19:58.725
That is a good question.

20:00.699 --> 20:04.157
Hey, I just ran into
a Fed in the lobby.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.737
He told me that,

20:05.737 --> 20:08.807
apparently, the Vegas case
fits the profile of a serial

20:08.807 --> 20:10.242
the FBI's been tracking.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.211
Hey, you're from Vegas?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.078
Speedle.
Brown.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.279
Where was the Fed?

20:14.279 --> 20:15.314
He's right there
in the lobby.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.382
He's got his little,
you know, headphone on,

20:17.382 --> 20:18.383
and his little tie.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.918
And you talked to him?

20:19.918 --> 20:20.919
Yeah.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.221
Do they have an I.D. Yet?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.655
No I.D. Yet,
but their perp

20:23.655 --> 20:25.424
targets
wealthy couples

20:25.424 --> 20:27.593
at their playgrounds...

20:27.593 --> 20:30.762
Pebble Beach,
Aspen, the Hamptons.

20:30.762 --> 20:34.198
Evidently, the husbands
get murdered first

20:34.233 --> 20:36.001
and the wives later...

20:36.001 --> 20:39.137
after they've enjoyed 48 hours
of fun and games.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.272
48?

20:40.272 --> 20:41.240
Vegas?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.902
Speedle.
Willows.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.244
That's it?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.212
There's also a link to Miami.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.981
Of course there is.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.050
Or, you know, he could
just be some geriatric dude

20:52.050 --> 20:53.210
that just digs the weather.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.188
I don't understand. Why didn't the Feds
put this out on NCIC?

20:56.188 --> 20:58.023
Because they're Feds.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.684
Excuse me.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.828
Dennis. Dennis.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.029
Yeah?

21:04.029 --> 21:05.030
Tick-tock, Dennis.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.266
While you're waiting
to get your ducks in a row,

21:07.266 --> 21:09.868
the guy with
the "Miami link" just slipped
through my hands.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.267
Horatio, I didn't have
federal approval...

21:11.303 --> 21:13.271
I need answers
for this little girl.

21:13.305 --> 21:15.974
Her father's just been killed...
maybe her mother, too...

21:15.974 --> 21:18.944
and that's your fault. You understand that.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.242
It sounds like you're
making this personal.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.182
Dennis,
you don't give me this link,

21:24.182 --> 21:26.480
I will make this
very
personal.

21:27.319 --> 21:31.156
All of his victims stayed
here in the last year.

21:31.156 --> 21:32.817
Here? This hotel?

21:32.958 --> 21:35.256
Rittle and his wife, too.
Last winter.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.864
Mmm. Wish I would
have known that. Maybe he would
still be alive.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.297
Yeah?

21:41.600 --> 21:44.296
(speaking Spanish)

21:45.971 --> 21:48.740
Si...Vamos.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.543
I had a bad feeling
about this.

21:51.543 --> 21:52.477
What did she
just say to you?

21:52.477 --> 21:56.004
She just said that you need
to learn the language.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.587
I don't see this burgundy car.

22:02.587 --> 22:03.422
Where you looking?

22:03.422 --> 22:05.657
Check the disturbance
along the bank

22:05.657 --> 22:06.825
and follow it in.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.283
How did you find
the disturbance? Drive up and down the

22:10.329 --> 22:12.297
No, the thing about Miami

22:12.331 --> 22:13.965
is the entire city's
watched from above.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.934
Coast Guard choppers.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.336
Someone going to cover me?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.236
I got you.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.406
Cover you for what?

22:21.406 --> 22:22.737
Alligators.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.302
Only way to
outrun a gator

22:26.345 --> 22:28.914
is to swim faster than
the guy next to you.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.115
Isn't that right, Delko?

22:30.115 --> 22:32.284
Used to have a partner.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.377
Guys... please?

23:33.145 --> 23:33.979
That her?

23:33.979 --> 23:38.143
Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.430
Our guy's still in the wind,
folks.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.166
Still in the wind.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.407
What's her name?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.139
Mina Rittle.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.417
Who wrapped you, Mina?

24:13.452 --> 24:15.784
The plastic wasn't
for transport.

24:15.821 --> 24:18.415
Covering her intimates...
most likely sexual.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.448
Two gunshot wounds,
left temple.

24:20.492 --> 24:23.427
One shot was
a through-and-through.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.432
Trace ASAP, along
with the plastic.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.135
My preliminary probe

24:30.135 --> 24:31.436
shows water
in the lungs,

24:31.436 --> 24:34.564
which indicates she was still alive when

24:37.476 --> 24:40.078
Looks like the eyes are glued shut.

24:40.078 --> 24:44.616
Gold crusty substance
underneath.

24:44.616 --> 24:47.084
What is that, Mina?

24:53.758 --> 24:56.161
The substance is water- soluble.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.891
But somehow it got preserved in the water.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.466
My guess is

25:01.466 --> 25:04.458
the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at

25:04.603 --> 25:06.628
Wait a minute.

25:06.972 --> 25:09.463
There's a lot more of it.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.545
What do you want to bet

25:13.545 --> 25:16.275
this is in every orifice?

25:19.518 --> 25:22.487
You guys got a sick one.

25:37.469 --> 25:38.570
Aha!

25:38.570 --> 25:41.339
Delko, you've been down there
for45 minutes.

25:41.339 --> 25:44.009
Do you know the
level of bacteria
in the water?

25:44.009 --> 25:45.744
You can get
all kinds of infections.

25:45.744 --> 25:46.745
What do you got?

25:46.745 --> 25:48.508
Water pistol.

25:48.547 --> 25:52.217
One water logged
Beretta knockoff.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.219
Suspect's personal gun?

25:54.219 --> 25:57.188
That's it.
Congratulations.

25:57.188 --> 26:00.058
I'll put it over the wires that he's not carrying
that Taurus anymore

26:00.058 --> 26:01.526
Do that, and take a shower.

26:01.526 --> 26:03.221
Nice shoes.

26:04.162 --> 26:07.365
Ma'am, you have
to concentrate
on the face...

26:07.365 --> 26:09.601
in parts...
not just the whole.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.836
Ask me
what he wore.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.572
Ask me if he was
good in bed.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.341
Just don't ask me
how close together
his eyes were.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.536
You said he kind of looked
like Ricky Martin, right?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.545
Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.513
Try to not
just picture him.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.572
Try to think of an event.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.752
Okay...

26:27.752 --> 26:29.421
Three-way kiss.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.254
His lower lip
was kind of pouty...

26:33.592 --> 26:35.260
and he had this

26:35.260 --> 26:37.596
Michael Douglas thing
working, you know... - 

26:37.596 --> 26:39.564
a cleft in his chin.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.231
Kind of like that?

26:40.231 --> 26:41.633
Yeah.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.364
You're right.
That is easier.

27:05.724 --> 27:08.591
Adam Van der Welk.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.255
Little girl saw a monster.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.593
Showgirl saw a husband.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.299
So this guy could be anybody.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.596
Yeah, that's the problem
with eyewitnesses.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.602
All the more reason
to rely on evidence.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.604
Tell Warrick hey.
Let me know if anything breaks.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.605
You, too.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.840
Hey.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.474
Hey.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.743
So, how's your colleague
Grissom doing

27:24.743 --> 27:25.903
on the aroma angle?

27:25.977 --> 27:27.979
I'm sure he's
making progress,

27:27.979 --> 27:30.482
but Grissom rarely says anything until he's
good

27:30.482 --> 27:31.549
Smart man.

27:31.549 --> 27:33.118
I just wanted to show
you something.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.353
The sticky substance
we got off the wife

27:35.353 --> 27:36.187
is, in fact, honey.

27:36.187 --> 27:39.257
You say that like
it means something.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.622
Well, honey on its own
is just honey

27:40.659 --> 27:44.763
but, when you add plastic wrap,
it's... a different situation.

27:44.763 --> 27:47.866
(techno-pop playing)

27:47.866 --> 27:49.891
(cheering)

27:56.341 --> 27:59.844
(crowd chanting)
Five... four... three...

27:59.844 --> 28:02.180
...two... one...

28:02.180 --> 28:04.239
(cheering)

28:24.703 --> 28:26.237
Yum.

28:26.237 --> 28:29.674
This is where
he got the idea.

28:29.674 --> 28:30.875
Yep.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.366
Wish me luck.

28:40.985 --> 28:42.954
Some guys like to lick it off.

28:42.954 --> 28:46.890
Really? I'm partial
to the swab myself.

28:48.326 --> 28:49.761
Ready, honey?

28:49.761 --> 28:51.456
Coming, dear.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.470
Tuberculosis victims
emit breath that smells

28:58.470 --> 28:59.698
like wet leaves.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.372
Maple, elm, ash, what?

29:01.372 --> 29:02.273
I'm not sure.

29:02.273 --> 29:04.707
Miami is pulling
cars out of canals,

29:04.743 --> 29:06.711
chasing leads,
debriefing the kid...

29:06.745 --> 29:08.713
and you guys are
flip ping through textbooks?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.415
This is how I work.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.117
Tuberculosis.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.486
Cyanide Poisoning.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.855
Endocrinology.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.380
I'm following my nosino.

29:19.424 --> 29:23.762
You're closer to this Van der Welk guy than

29:23.762 --> 29:26.564
Doctor.

29:26.564 --> 29:27.766
Doctor.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.702
How about Darier disease?

29:30.702 --> 29:33.171
Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like

29:33.171 --> 29:36.508
We're looking for something
a little sweeter.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.443
There's diabetic ketoacidosis.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.975
Body has excess glucose,
which converts to ketone...

29:43.314 --> 29:45.748
gets expelled
through the pore s.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.752
Has a fruity smell.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.779
It would help if we had a piece
of the assailant's clothing.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.461
What?

29:56.461 --> 29:58.759
I think I overlooked some evidence.

30:00.131 --> 30:03.835
I'm going to isolate it
using high-performance

30:03.835 --> 30:05.996
liquid chromatography.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.774
Once we identify
the pollen,

30:09.808 --> 30:11.799
we'll know if it's floral honey.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.486
So, H, when's the last time you were in

30:21.486 --> 30:22.783
I was there opening night.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.482
I didn't see you there.

30:24.522 --> 30:25.523
I was, uh...

30:25.523 --> 30:27.491
VIP.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.263
What is this?

30:32.263 --> 30:33.787
It's Tupelo honey.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.800
It's the purest
of all honeys.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.570
Stays in liquid form for life. Doesn't

30:38.570 --> 30:39.798
Where'd you get that?

30:39.838 --> 30:42.807
CDC hip ped me to it after that Africanized

30:42.841 --> 30:45.610
Okay, let's swap
this out.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.771
I want you to take
a look at this.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.806
We got this off
the chief's wife.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.311
It's a match.

30:59.657 --> 31:01.386
It's a match.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.819
$500 for five dollars' worth of honey? I don't

31:05.864 --> 31:07.799
Those are mostly
for decoration

31:07.799 --> 31:10.632
but, once in a while, some bigwig comes,

31:10.735 --> 31:13.295
Wouldn't it have
been easier to put these in order? This is

31:13.538 --> 31:16.140
Maybe not. I've got a receipt
from two nights ago.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.835
Let me see that.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.846
Do you recognize
this guy?

31:21.846 --> 31:24.838
Yeah. Looks just like every other Joe that

31:24.883 --> 31:26.851
Look, you work the door.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.854
Anybody come in here
in the last 48 hours

31:29.888 --> 31:32.557
that bought some of that
very expensive Tupelo honey?

31:32.557 --> 31:34.626
This is Miami. Every night's a weekend.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.857
My people tell me
that a customer came in two nights ago to

31:37.896 --> 31:39.864
Wasn't a customer. It was a limo driver.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.866
- A limo driver? - Yeah. Gordon.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.868
Gave me a C-note
just to double- park.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.564
Did this Gordon tell you who he had in the

31:46.604 --> 31:49.869
No. Just that it was some rich guy... some

31:49.908 --> 31:52.744
Let me guess... from Vegas.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.575
Yeah.

31:59.918 --> 32:04.412
(siren wailing)

32:05.423 --> 32:07.584
How did
you find him?

32:07.625 --> 32:10.028
Figured, limo driver...
airport.

32:10.028 --> 32:12.895
I spotted Gordon,
here, on Alton...

32:12.931 --> 32:14.922
back way to
Miami International.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.602
Lit him up,
pulled him over here.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.836
Nice work.

32:18.836 --> 32:20.895
You got a
last name, Gordon?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.600
Daimler.

32:22.640 --> 32:27.312
Look, Officer, the Corwins are coming in on
their

32:27.312 --> 32:28.904
I really
should be there.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.915
Well, the Corwins
are going to have to wait.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.484
We understand that another one of your

32:33.484 --> 32:36.920
bought some very expensive honey from a

32:36.955 --> 32:39.924
Yeah, well, I've had
stranger requests.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.926
This customer of yours
have a name?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.662
Never got it. He paid cash. Never saw a

32:44.662 --> 32:47.927
Well, did you notice anything unusual about

32:47.966 --> 32:49.934
Did he smell?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.959
Did he... have an odor?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.269
Uh... his breath, maybe. He'd been drinking

32:55.306 --> 32:58.309
Remember what he was drinking? Was it

32:58.309 --> 32:59.644
Whatever I have stocked.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.943
- Well, we'd like
to take a look. - Sure. Go ahead.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.364
Vodka.

33:31.242 --> 33:32.402
Gin.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.697
Smell that?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.932
Sickly sweet.

33:54.932 --> 33:58.299
That's exactly how Grissom described it.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.009
You want me to do what?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.034
Smell this.

34:15.887 --> 34:16.788
That's it.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.018
That's Adam's smell.

34:19.056 --> 34:22.025
In the five days
that you two were together,

34:22.060 --> 34:23.828
did you happen to notice
what he was drinking?

34:23.828 --> 34:25.022
Champagne.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.433
Did he ever drink
anything sweeter, like whiskey or cognac?

34:28.433 --> 34:30.025
Are you kidding me?

34:30.068 --> 34:33.731
With him, it was
all Dom all the time.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.041
You found a medical condition.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.043
Diabetic ketoacidosis.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.045
It's an insulin deficiency.

34:41.079 --> 34:45.038
His body's been expelling
excess glucose. Makes him smell fruity.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.418
Which, I guess,
could easily
be mistaken

34:47.418 --> 34:49.187
for whiskey breath.

34:49.187 --> 34:51.052
Hey, can you

34:51.089 --> 34:54.859
test for diabetic
ketoacidosis off urine?

34:54.859 --> 34:56.053
Well, blood's the best

34:56.094 --> 34:58.830
but, if you had a urine sample,
maybe.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.856
Ask him what medication
you would take for that.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.059
What would
a doctor prescribe?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.093
Novalin insulin.

35:08.339 --> 35:10.641
Lucky for us we found
blood in his urine.

35:10.641 --> 35:13.644
Absence of C- Peptide
in the blood.

35:13.644 --> 35:17.080
Means the insulin
in our guy's system isn't natural...
it's synthetic.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.817
And prescribed. We're right over here.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.808
This is our database.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.356
Okay, what we're looking for
is a patient

35:25.356 --> 35:28.226
who's purchased
synthetic insulin

35:28.226 --> 35:30.456
in the last 48 hours.

35:34.999 --> 35:38.025
Here we go.

35:43.841 --> 35:46.105
Gordon Daimler.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.912
That's the limo driver.

35:47.912 --> 35:48.913
That's him.

35:48.913 --> 35:51.249
And the reason that old Gordon
probably didn't smell

35:51.249 --> 35:52.083
when we picked him up

35:52.083 --> 35:54.418
is because he'd just taken
his insulin, hadn't he?

35:54.418 --> 35:58.389
But the scent was still
in the limo's AC system.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.424
Well, now we have
this guy's address.

36:00.424 --> 36:03.060
Yes, take a look
at this address.
A limousine driver

36:03.060 --> 36:06.631
with a house on the water
in Coconut Grove?

36:06.631 --> 36:07.798
I don't think so.

36:07.798 --> 36:11.302
Who's the owner of record?

36:11.302 --> 36:13.634
Let's check it.

36:15.606 --> 36:18.131
Sissy and Dylan Corwin.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.147
That's the couple that
he was picking up at the airport

36:23.181 --> 36:24.615
when we pulled him over.

36:24.615 --> 36:25.843
That's right.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.176
So then maybe that's how
he finds his victims... driving a limo.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.153
And, when they're away
at some posh resort,

36:33.191 --> 36:36.160
he moves into
their house,
doesn't he?

36:36.194 --> 36:38.296
Hops over to Las Vegas.

36:38.296 --> 36:41.499
Visits the couple
he met in Miami. Kills the husband...
Mm-hmm.

36:41.499 --> 36:44.161
...brings the wife
back here... kills her.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.171
And, when the Corwins
come home...

36:47.205 --> 36:49.730
not good.

37:01.018 --> 37:03.987
No one's answering inside.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.218
Miami- Dade Police!

37:43.160 --> 37:44.593
Slowly.

37:46.497 --> 37:47.930
Slowly.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.952
I got a blood trail here...

38:07.952 --> 38:10.546
leading to the garage.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.000
He dragged her body to here...

38:56.000 --> 38:57.435
and put her in that car.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.300
Nine-mil.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.675
One shot's
a through-and-through.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.302
Scalp hair.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.480
He fired this one first.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.115
I don't know.

39:11.115 --> 39:13.310
To terrorize her.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.319
This strike here.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.344
That one's all business.

39:43.314 --> 39:46.250
He wrapped her in plastic by the bed,

39:46.250 --> 39:47.342
raped her.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.354
Then dragged her
in here and cornered her like an animal

39:50.388 --> 39:52.156
If Gordon's true to form,

39:52.156 --> 39:54.351
he's going
to kill the Corwins.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.361
You guys should take
a look at this.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.365
Well, people don't really buy these houses
for the view.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.368
It's a place to put a million-dollar boat.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.370
But what's your point?

40:08.506 --> 40:10.371
The boat's missing,

40:10.408 --> 40:13.377
and that's where he's
killing them right now.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.546
Speed, get on that thing
right now.

40:15.546 --> 40:19.150
Put the birds in the air
and call the Coast Guard. Right now. Do it.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.085
Air and Sea, this
is Tim Speedle.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.383
I need you to be
on the lookout for a yacht... T-45.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.389
R.O. Dylan and
Sissy Corwin.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.051
Commandeered by one Gordon Daimler.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.427
Gordon Daimler.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.394
Commandeered by...

40:30.428 --> 40:32.396
Gordon Daimler.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.370
Coast Guard found her adrift!

40:39.370 --> 40:41.395
No radio contact!

40:41.439 --> 40:43.207
We hailed her.

40:43.207 --> 40:44.408
No response.

40:44.408 --> 40:45.397
Infrared's up.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.445
Blue means dead,
red means alive.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.779
Pink.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.848
Body heat's fading. Person's dying.

40:50.848 --> 40:53.117
- Identify the other players. - Speed?

40:53.117 --> 40:55.052
Red. Is that our suspect?

40:55.052 --> 40:56.417
I'm not sure.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.222
I am.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.416
How?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.192
We haven't identified all the players.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.422
He's going back to finish off
the job. Detweiler.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.429
Getting a bead on him, sir.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.132
M.O. On this guy says husband's already

41:08.132 --> 41:10.430
He's going back to finish off the wife.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.129
You're good to go.

41:12.169 --> 41:15.434
Body language does not look like an attack.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.247
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.216
Don't the Corwins
have a jet?

41:25.216 --> 41:27.184
The Corwins have a jet, right?

41:27.184 --> 41:29.175
Gordon's left them here to die!

41:29.220 --> 41:31.422
Abort this, Sackheim!
Abort this!

41:31.422 --> 41:33.481
Interstate case.
Not your call! Proceed!

41:33.591 --> 41:35.456
Stand down!

41:35.493 --> 41:37.484
Take him out!

41:37.862 --> 41:41.165
Detweiler, I know you want to impress your

41:41.165 --> 41:42.496
but there's an innocent
man on that boat.

41:42.566 --> 41:44.158
Now, if you take this shot,

41:44.201 --> 41:46.504
I'm going to be in your grille for the rest of
your natural life.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.632
I want you to think bout what that might be

41:50.808 --> 41:52.503
Think about that.

41:59.049 --> 42:03.486
Thank you. Speed,
the Corwins have a jet. Find the jet.

42:03.521 --> 42:08.325
Call the FAA, and ground the jet by authority
of Miami-Dade County.

42:08.325 --> 42:09.485
You got it, H.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.892
Give us 30 seconds.

42:10.928 --> 42:12.919
Then send backup!

42:18.536 --> 42:20.527
Mr. Corwin!

42:21.205 --> 42:23.340
I tried to save her.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.043
It's too late.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.307
(sobbing)

42:30.247 --> 42:32.841
Get me Fire and Rescue.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.722
A few more minutes, sir,

42:38.722 --> 42:41.714
we'll be on our way
to Monaco.

42:44.528 --> 42:46.826
(pistol cocking)

42:48.532 --> 42:50.397
Good evening...

42:51.168 --> 42:53.170
Mr. Van der Welk.

42:53.170 --> 42:56.162
Gordon, did you drive
your limo here?

42:58.208 --> 42:59.176
He's clean.

42:59.176 --> 43:01.111
The Corwins...

43:01.111 --> 43:01.979
are my friends.

43:01.979 --> 43:03.280
They lent me this plane.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.417
Like the lent you their boat?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.118
Speak to the pilot.

43:08.118 --> 43:10.245
Dylan Corwin called him personally.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.551
Directed him to fly me
to Monaco.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.549
I'd rather call "Dylan"
at the hospital to confirm.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.562
The husband
didn't die.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.257
You left us a witness

43:20.331 --> 43:22.866
and enough evidence to convict you in two

43:22.866 --> 43:25.936
Rich men don't go to jail.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.370
You're not rich, Gordon.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.582
I'm going to, uh...

43:38.616 --> 43:40.584
I'm going
to book this guy. You want to go with?

43:40.618 --> 43:41.585
Nah, you got it.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.253
I'll have my D.A.
Call your D.A.

43:43.253 --> 43:44.845
(chuckles)

43:45.756 --> 43:47.587
Sounds good.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.593
Sounds good.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.027
Uh... Thank you
for your help on this.

43:52.062 --> 43:54.587
Thanks for yours, actually.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.600
Right.

43:57.434 --> 43:59.595
You take care of yourself.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.606
I always do.

44:19.556 --> 44:20.989
Hey.

44:26.664 --> 44:30.259
My mommy and daddy are dead,
aren't they?

44:32.703 --> 44:37.606
Well, your aunt is flying in to talk to you.

44:37.808 --> 44:40.538
That's a yes.

44:42.079 --> 44:44.775
I lost someone once.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.408
Who?

44:48.686 --> 44:50.881
Well...

44:51.689 --> 44:53.624
Did you feel sick?

44:53.624 --> 44:55.426
Still do.

44:55.426 --> 44:56.723
Still do.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.687
Sasha...

45:01.031 --> 45:03.659
People are going to say
a lot of things about your mom and dad,

45:03.701 --> 45:05.669
and some of them
are going to be true,

45:05.703 --> 45:07.638
but what I want you to remember

45:07.638 --> 45:10.300
is that they fought like heroes for you.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.639
Will you remember
that for me?

45:15.713 --> 45:16.747
Good.

45:16.747 --> 45:18.681
Good for you.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.695
Hello.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.697
Hey.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.701
Nice tan.

45:37.735 --> 45:38.736
Nice suit.

45:38.736 --> 45:43.207
Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back

45:43.207 --> 45:44.697
Yeah.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.710
Right.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.178
Really.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.708
What?

45:52.750 --> 45:53.739
Nothing.

45:54.084 --> 45:57.713
It's just... unusual to see you dressed like

45:57.755 --> 46:00.724
I had to go to the chief's funeral.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.727
Missed me that much, huh?

46:04.305 --> 46:10.313
