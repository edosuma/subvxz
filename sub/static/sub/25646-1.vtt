00:20.512 --> 00:23.312
Who are
you when no one's watching?

00:37.729 --> 00:40.498
Everyone thinks that
your life is this fairy tale.

00:41.766 --> 00:44.667
You know, you're
either making movies

00:44.669 --> 00:49.541
or partying,
or on a beach, or a yacht.

00:53.778 --> 00:55.345
It's all transitory.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.518
And eventually you have
to go back to reality.

01:04.888 --> 01:07.491
And you have to live with
the person inside of you.

01:15.132 --> 01:17.267
I never liked that person.

01:24.374 --> 01:25.609
I'm not a real person.

01:31.582 --> 01:32.583
That's why...

01:33.817 --> 01:36.284
That's why I'm addicted to it,

01:36.286 --> 01:37.387
because I'm...

01:38.622 --> 01:39.623
I'm nothing...

01:41.325 --> 01:42.392
Without the attention.

01:45.929 --> 01:47.696
It's like a drug,
where you just,

01:47.698 --> 01:50.534
you need more
and more and more

01:52.736 --> 01:54.136
and eventually...

01:57.741 --> 01:59.473
Eventually, you don't

01:59.475 --> 02:01.510
care what you got
to do to get it.

02:14.690 --> 02:16.523
Sydney! Sydney!
Sydney! Sydney! Sydney!

02:16.525 --> 02:18.425
Where's markey?

02:18.427 --> 02:20.229
Markey who?

03:42.911 --> 03:45.379
If there was
any other way, markey.

03:50.051 --> 03:52.484
You're gonna take care of all
my social media when I'm gone.

03:52.486 --> 03:53.685
Is that really what
you're worried about?

03:53.687 --> 03:55.589
- Yeah.
- Your brand?

03:59.060 --> 04:00.927
I don't know
if you've noticed,

04:00.929 --> 04:03.395
but producers aren't
exactly lining up

04:03.397 --> 04:04.730
to get them
some markey marlowe.

04:04.732 --> 04:06.032
Don't be mean.

04:06.034 --> 04:07.933
You think that's mean?

04:07.935 --> 04:09.901
What do you think
jail's gonna be like?

04:09.903 --> 04:11.470
I've already been, remember?

04:11.472 --> 04:12.604
I look awesome in a jumpsuit.

04:12.606 --> 04:16.841
Real jail, markey,
real jail.

04:16.844 --> 04:18.610
Not some sleepover
in an administration office

04:18.612 --> 04:21.248
that you were too
wasted to remember anyway.

04:24.952 --> 04:25.984
Whatever.

05:11.864 --> 05:13.631
How many people know I'm here?

05:13.633 --> 05:16.066
Outside the court,
just me,

05:16.068 --> 05:18.070
your attorneys and
your landlord, Daryl.

05:21.474 --> 05:24.041
So you trust some random
guy not to tell anyone,

05:24.043 --> 05:25.378
but you don't trust me?

05:27.113 --> 05:28.779
We did trust you, markey,

05:28.781 --> 05:31.715
but you ruined that when
you hid drugs in your house

05:31.717 --> 05:33.418
and then assaulted your mom.

05:35.955 --> 05:38.323
The fridge and the
pantry are fully stocked.

05:39.491 --> 05:40.693
Plenty of bottled water.

05:43.696 --> 05:44.864
No Espresso maker?

05:52.404 --> 05:53.672
Who's gonna make it?

05:57.076 --> 05:58.808
I'm gonna try
to come check on you,

05:58.810 --> 06:01.477
but once the paparazzi
realize that you're gone,

06:01.479 --> 06:03.080
they're gonna tell
everyone you know,

06:03.082 --> 06:05.550
so I may not be able to make
it back before this is over.

06:07.085 --> 06:09.519
So you're leaving me
here with no cell phone,

06:09.521 --> 06:11.022
no Internet, and no TV.

06:12.457 --> 06:13.959
There is a TV.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.894
Everything's been
cleaned and disinfected.

06:17.896 --> 06:19.696
The linens are new, 600 thread,

06:19.698 --> 06:21.867
Egyptian, just like
you have at home.

06:26.071 --> 06:28.039
Is that
all you packed for me?

06:29.808 --> 06:31.142
There's more in the closet.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.964
You're leaving me
here to die, aren't you?

06:54.065 --> 06:55.564
There's only two keys.

06:55.566 --> 06:56.932
You've got one,
and I've got one.

06:56.934 --> 06:58.567
Unless it's someone
from the court,

06:58.569 --> 07:00.905
do not open the door for
anyone, do you understand?

07:03.007 --> 07:05.974
What about my landlord?

07:05.976 --> 07:07.709
Forget about him.

07:07.711 --> 07:09.845
I mean, he has a key but
he's not gonna bother you.

07:09.847 --> 07:13.682
And you are not gonna bother
him unless it's an emergency.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.217
He'd be lucky
to be bothered by me.

07:15.219 --> 07:17.922
Markey, please, he just
lost his grandmother.

07:19.723 --> 07:23.926
What if he tries to

07:23.928 --> 07:27.729
make a suit
out of my skin or...

07:27.731 --> 07:30.899
Seriously, there's nothing
to worry about, he's fine.

07:30.901 --> 07:33.436
And he signed a huge
confidentiality agreement.

07:35.172 --> 07:37.172
They set the GPS on
the monitor to the footprint

07:37.174 --> 07:40.743
of the property, so just
stay within the fence line.

07:46.016 --> 07:47.017
Come here.

07:52.789 --> 07:54.889
You just have
to stay here for 30 days

07:54.891 --> 07:57.892
and then your
probation will be over,

07:57.894 --> 08:00.029
and you can start
rebuilding your brand.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.003
I know this is gonna be hard,

08:09.005 --> 08:10.740
but I know you can do it.

08:13.843 --> 08:16.210
What difference does it make?

08:16.212 --> 08:17.814
Nobody cares about me anymore.

08:20.650 --> 08:22.652
I think it's time
you grow up.

08:52.081 --> 08:54.950
Never showed me
upstairs, Annie.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.933
Her only
constant companion, the camera,

09:47.935 --> 09:49.768
her expressionless friend.

09:49.770 --> 09:53.406
Her nameless lover,
it follows her everywhere,

09:53.408 --> 09:57.042
greedily capturing her
for every breath taken.

09:57.044 --> 09:59.044
For Marilyn is a star.

09:59.046 --> 10:02.147
Undeniably, she is the star,

10:02.149 --> 10:06.018
embodying every shimmering
greed that lights our eyes.

10:06.020 --> 10:09.254
But what exists behind
the glittering cascade?

10:09.256 --> 10:13.025
The camera's merciless gaze
reveals her unadorned face,

10:13.027 --> 10:16.630
eyes, and only by the fires,
the quiet struggle.

10:35.748 --> 10:39.017
I can't just ignore the
incidents leading up to this.

10:39.019 --> 10:41.853
The escalating violence
going on within this family,

10:41.855 --> 10:43.388
it's a mess.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.290
Just like all the press
clamoring outside

10:45.292 --> 10:48.227
that I had to ban
from the courtroom.

10:48.229 --> 10:50.897
I am going to issue the temporary
restraining order for 30 days.

10:52.399 --> 10:54.399
Jade marlowe and Cara marlowe,

10:54.401 --> 10:57.336
this no contact order
goes both ways.

10:57.338 --> 11:00.773
God knows all parties could
use a break from each other.

11:02.175 --> 11:03.908
If there's nothing else
from the plaintiffs,

11:03.910 --> 11:05.343
you two are dismissed.

11:05.345 --> 11:06.713
Thank you, your honor.

11:11.951 --> 11:13.751
See you out there, mar?

11:13.753 --> 11:15.920
Hundred feet, little one.

11:15.922 --> 11:17.421
Don't worry about her, jadey.

11:17.423 --> 11:19.292
Miss marlowe, sit down.

11:21.361 --> 11:24.929
Barring any setbacks,
we will reconvene this matter

11:24.931 --> 11:26.497
on the last day of
your house arrest,

11:26.499 --> 11:29.733
which is August the 5th.

11:29.735 --> 11:31.037
We're adjourned.

11:35.941 --> 11:37.974
...saw her hidden moves,

11:37.976 --> 11:42.979
yet fewer still took them
to be omens of mortal doom.

11:42.981 --> 11:45.316
Always, Marilyn's
performances shone

11:45.318 --> 11:47.418
with an undeniable sparkle.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.756
She dreamed our
dreams on the screen.

11:54.793 --> 11:57.827
One is a brilliant light
with a lurking shadow,

11:57.829 --> 12:01.233
and one burns more
quickly and more furiously.

12:05.304 --> 12:07.739
This is the defining irony
of her legacy.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.854
Don't worry about her, jadey.

12:26.024 --> 12:28.260
Don't worry about her, jadey.

12:54.285 --> 12:57.255
Plug, water, coffee.

13:02.293 --> 13:04.462
Power.

13:38.895 --> 13:42.165
Come on, Annie,
no bikini either.

13:58.381 --> 14:00.917
Wow, tmz would love
to see me in these.

14:09.993 --> 14:12.929
Something to read would
have been nice too, Annie.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.173
Hello?

15:00.175 --> 15:02.376
Excuse me,
I locked myself out.

15:02.378 --> 15:05.114
Do you have a key, please?
Thank you.

15:08.050 --> 15:10.919
I locked myself out.
Do you have a key for my door?

15:25.167 --> 15:27.467
Thank you.
What's upstairs?

15:30.205 --> 15:31.471
I'm sorry, what?

15:31.473 --> 15:34.006
There's stairs
in my living room

15:34.008 --> 15:35.375
that lead
to a locked door,

15:35.377 --> 15:37.344
and I heard noises above
my bedroom last night.

15:37.346 --> 15:39.145
Just... what's upstairs?

15:39.147 --> 15:41.182
Rats, probably.

16:46.581 --> 16:48.515
Good morning, ladies.

17:30.089 --> 17:31.090
Yes?

17:32.124 --> 17:33.593
I'm bored.

17:34.794 --> 17:37.162
So go watch
TV or something.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.536
That sounds like something
my grandma used to say.

17:50.309 --> 17:52.543
Can you at least open
the door and look at me

17:52.545 --> 17:53.779
while I talk to you?

18:01.287 --> 18:04.557
My TV remote is broken.
Can you fix it for me?

18:12.831 --> 18:15.399
What happened to your grandma?

18:15.401 --> 18:16.733
Died.

18:16.735 --> 18:21.237
Obviously. How?

18:21.239 --> 18:23.609
Cancer. What are her
figurines doing in here?

18:25.477 --> 18:27.511
This is stupid, but, um,

18:27.513 --> 18:28.845
I can't sleep
without my bears

18:28.847 --> 18:33.215
and ever since I was
little, I would have one

18:33.217 --> 18:35.184
that would stay in bed
with me and the other

18:35.186 --> 18:37.486
would watch both of us
from the night stand,

18:37.488 --> 18:40.556
so I though the
figurines might help.

18:40.558 --> 18:42.859
Actually, first, I tried to
watch myself in the mirror,

18:42.861 --> 18:44.462
but that was really stupid.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.534
I can't believe Annie
forgot to pack them.

18:51.536 --> 18:52.869
If the bears
were so important,

18:52.871 --> 18:55.271
why didn't you
pack them yourself?

18:55.273 --> 18:57.342
She's my assistant.
She packs.

18:58.376 --> 18:59.809
It's dead, I'm sorry.

18:59.811 --> 19:01.279
What am I supposed to do?

19:05.283 --> 19:07.683
Thank you, I knew how
to turn it on like that.

19:07.685 --> 19:09.385
Oh, well, then you're
not that helpless.

19:09.387 --> 19:11.821
Was your grandma
that helpless?

19:11.823 --> 19:13.391
What's that supposed to mean?

19:15.627 --> 19:19.260
I don't know, I just said it.
Sometimes I say stupid...

19:19.262 --> 19:21.566
She was dying, she
couldn't help how she was.

19:23.266 --> 19:25.202
Maybe I can't help how I am.

19:33.343 --> 19:36.511
You made me like this.
You don't care about me.

19:36.513 --> 19:38.948
All you care about is money.

19:38.950 --> 19:40.548
You're nothing
but a pimp, Cara.

19:40.550 --> 19:44.452
Don't you call me Cara.
I'm your mother.

19:44.454 --> 19:47.389
Oh, so I can
call my mother a pimp,

19:47.391 --> 19:48.891
but I can't call her
by her first name.

19:48.893 --> 19:51.259
Shut up, markey.
I don't want Jade hearing you

19:51.261 --> 19:52.995
talk to me like that.
You are ruining her.

19:52.997 --> 19:55.730
Oh, I'm ruining her?

19:55.732 --> 19:59.467
So I guess it was my fault
that your precious little

19:59.469 --> 20:03.004
underage piece of Jade
got herself drunk

20:03.006 --> 20:05.407
and decided to hook up
with scumbag Nick

20:05.409 --> 20:07.375
at a nightclub?

20:07.377 --> 20:09.346
I am the one that saved her.

20:10.947 --> 20:14.482
You were probably too busy
sucking down a bottle of wine

20:14.484 --> 20:16.351
to even know
that she snuck out.

20:16.353 --> 20:17.919
That's it, markey.

20:17.921 --> 20:19.654
You are done
talking to me like that

20:19.656 --> 20:21.491
and you are done
with this family!

20:22.993 --> 20:25.359
I see.

20:25.361 --> 20:28.429
So the pimp lost
control of one whore

20:28.431 --> 20:31.200
and now she's afraid
to lose the other.

20:33.670 --> 20:36.771
I made you what you are.

20:36.773 --> 20:39.974
Everything,
everything you have

20:39.976 --> 20:41.544
is because of me...

20:42.778 --> 20:44.513
And this is what
I get for it?

20:48.651 --> 20:49.652
Yeah,

20:52.822 --> 20:55.522
you made me what I am

20:55.524 --> 20:57.226
and this is what you get for it.

22:22.644 --> 22:24.545
I need your help.
I'm bleeding,

22:26.680 --> 22:28.080
I cut myself and I'm bleeding.

22:28.082 --> 22:30.084
Okay, okay, okay,
stop, I'll look at it.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.653
Okay, cover it up,
cover it up.

22:34.655 --> 22:37.924
- What did you do?
- I cut myself.

22:37.926 --> 22:40.392
On purpose. Could you just
do something about it?

22:40.394 --> 22:41.994
I need something.

22:41.996 --> 22:43.897
Okay, I'll be right back.
Hang on.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.492
Okay, this is...

23:15.494 --> 23:18.065
This will sting.
Move your hand, please.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.400
Okay.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.803
Ow.

23:24.805 --> 23:26.437
- Can you hold that there?
- Mm.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.809
God, please don't
tell anybody about this.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.544
I signed an agreement.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.682
How did they find this place?

23:38.684 --> 23:40.618
Your attorneys had a connection
with the coroner's office

23:40.620 --> 23:43.156
and this place fit all their
needs and I need the money.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.730
You know there's
a guy in Japan

23:52.732 --> 23:54.967
that would a pay million
bucks for my bloody tampons?

23:57.069 --> 23:59.203
So sell it to him.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.973
Sicko would probably
know the difference.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.476
Nobody cares about me.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.177
I'm just a piece of meat
to all of them.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.914
All they care about
is money,

24:09.916 --> 24:11.884
and once that's over...

24:13.853 --> 24:16.586
They're all gone.

24:16.588 --> 24:17.757
Except Annie.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.558
She's the only one
I've got left.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.532
And I have to pay her
just to be around me.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.840
- Yeah?
- Move

24:43.149 --> 24:46.283
Now, if there's nothing
else I can do for you...

24:46.285 --> 24:47.886
You can get my bears for me.

24:49.255 --> 24:52.221
That was rhetorical.
That was rhetoric.

24:52.223 --> 24:53.224
Please.

24:54.592 --> 24:56.092
Look, I cut myself
on purpose,

24:56.094 --> 24:59.662
because I am going insane,
for Christ's sakes.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.297
I need my bears,
I'm not gonna make it

25:01.299 --> 25:02.734
through this without them.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.308
I get it,

25:12.310 --> 25:14.811
you're like some sort of recluse
or some shit like that.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.013
No, I'm not some sort of
recluse or some shit like that.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.915
Okay, when was
the last time you got out?

25:18.917 --> 25:21.152
I made the arrangements
when my grandmother died.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.995
My grandma Addie...

25:32.163 --> 25:34.197
She's the one
that got me the bears.

25:34.199 --> 25:37.933
She was this actress
in the '60s

25:37.935 --> 25:39.636
and I wanted to
be just like her.

25:41.339 --> 25:45.341
And she got me
two Teddy bears...

25:45.343 --> 25:49.011
With the theater masks
for faces?

25:49.013 --> 25:50.846
- Yeah.
- And she told me

25:50.848 --> 25:53.081
to sleep
with the drama bear,

25:53.083 --> 25:56.151
so that the sad face would

25:56.153 --> 25:59.688
scare away all the monsters
like a gargoyle.

25:59.690 --> 26:03.125
And that I should
put the comedy bear

26:03.127 --> 26:05.827
on my nightstand,
so that its smile

26:05.829 --> 26:06.895
is the first thing
that I saw

26:06.897 --> 26:08.265
when I woke up in the morning.

26:11.969 --> 26:14.670
You miss taking care of
your grandmother, don't you?

26:19.309 --> 26:20.110
I owed it to her.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.715
But it was more than that,
wasn't it?

26:28.385 --> 26:31.186
I mattered.

26:31.188 --> 26:33.854
She needed me.

26:33.856 --> 26:35.625
Then do this for me, please.

26:36.893 --> 26:38.326
I know it seems
like a little thing,

26:38.328 --> 26:41.731
but it means so much to me.

26:42.799 --> 26:44.200
I need you.

26:45.201 --> 26:46.569
You can matter to me.

26:52.742 --> 26:55.778
Won't the paparazzi
be staking out your house?

27:11.127 --> 27:12.128
Thank you.

27:18.201 --> 27:21.102

28:04.212 --> 28:05.478
You didn't get it?

28:05.480 --> 28:07.215
A guy ambushed me
in the back yard.

28:09.117 --> 28:10.782
Paparazzi?

28:10.784 --> 28:12.751
I didn't see a camera.

28:12.753 --> 28:14.887
Did you get
a good look at him?

28:14.889 --> 28:17.791
I punched him and I ran away.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.363
I can show you, here.

28:22.730 --> 28:24.665
Why'd you bring a camera?

28:26.368 --> 28:29.069
Because I thought
you might like to see.

28:35.477 --> 28:38.343
Get off me, aah!

28:38.345 --> 28:39.978
Bitch! Oh...

28:39.980 --> 28:41.449
Wait, wait, go back.
I think that's Nick.

28:42.783 --> 28:45.317
Get off me, aah!

28:45.319 --> 28:46.885
Bitch!

28:46.887 --> 28:49.388
Yep, that was Nick.

28:49.390 --> 28:52.257
That's your ex-boyfriend Nick?

28:52.259 --> 28:53.994
I wish you could have
punched his teeth in.

28:57.798 --> 28:59.133
You didn't ask.

29:39.906 --> 29:42.075
I feel like
when I'm playing a role...

29:44.578 --> 29:46.012
...I'm free.

29:48.314 --> 29:50.917
I'm free from having to be me.

30:05.864 --> 30:06.865
I do.

30:09.335 --> 30:13.304
My name is Adele marlowe.

30:13.306 --> 30:17.843
I'm markey marlowe's grandma
Addie on her father's side.

30:19.612 --> 30:23.913
Oh, markey was
a beautiful baby,

30:23.915 --> 30:27.117
but she wasn't...

30:27.119 --> 30:30.488
She wasn't a beautiful child.

30:30.490 --> 30:33.624
She wasn't
allowed to be a child.

30:33.626 --> 30:37.095
Her parents always wanted
her to be something else.

30:39.599 --> 30:43.235
An actress, model,

30:44.637 --> 30:47.070
beauty queen,

30:47.072 --> 30:49.041
meal ticket, mostly.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.411
Maybe some of it
was my fault.

30:54.413 --> 30:58.348
When she was little, I used to sing
"twinkle twinkle little star" to her

30:58.350 --> 31:01.351
to get her to stop crying.

31:01.353 --> 31:03.121
Worked every time.

31:04.523 --> 31:08.023
Her mother insisted her
first word was "mama."

31:08.025 --> 31:11.996
Mm-mm,
I know it was "star."

31:14.098 --> 31:15.866
It appeared
that she enjoyed it.

31:17.602 --> 31:21.270
I mean, what child wouldn't
love all that attention?

31:21.272 --> 31:24.273
She got to play
dress up every day,

31:24.275 --> 31:27.209
and on set she was waited
on hand and foot

31:27.211 --> 31:31.146
or she was treated
like a Princess.

31:31.148 --> 31:34.249
Isn't that what every
little girl wants nowadays,

31:34.251 --> 31:35.252
to be a Princess?

31:41.158 --> 31:44.362
I think what she
really wanted was...

31:46.097 --> 31:48.933
To be loved
without an audience.

31:54.605 --> 31:57.639
Well, I wasn't around
very long.

31:57.641 --> 32:02.879
I didn't see how
it tore everyone apart.

32:05.616 --> 32:09.551
She needed someone
to guide her,

32:09.553 --> 32:12.521
and to watch over her

32:12.523 --> 32:16.358
and to protect her,

32:16.360 --> 32:20.027
someone motivated by
love and caring

32:20.029 --> 32:22.031
and not money and fame.

32:28.639 --> 32:32.340
I like to think that if
I was still there for her,

32:32.342 --> 32:37.280
maybe she wouldn't be
the way that she is now.

32:41.217 --> 32:43.553
Maybe I'm just fooling myself.

32:46.523 --> 32:49.592
Nothing in markey's
life was ever real.

32:54.130 --> 32:56.499
Maybe she's too far gone now.

32:59.702 --> 33:01.970
Maybe she should just give up.

33:10.245 --> 33:11.246
What?

33:15.150 --> 33:17.286
What, what do you want, what?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.589
What are you doing?

33:21.591 --> 33:23.491
Uh, no, what are you
doing banging on my door

33:23.493 --> 33:25.192
in the middle of the
night like a crazy person?

33:25.194 --> 33:27.728
I heard you talking
in there, didn't I?

33:27.730 --> 33:29.764
Stalk much?

33:29.766 --> 33:32.365
The walls are thin and
it's not the first time

33:32.367 --> 33:34.234
that I've heard you
talking in there, is it?

33:34.236 --> 33:35.770
And you're not supposed
to have a cell phone

33:35.772 --> 33:38.238
and also, if you
violate your probation

33:38.240 --> 33:40.175
while you're in there,
they will blame me.

33:43.145 --> 33:45.714
Jesus, okay,
I'll show you, come on.

33:51.520 --> 33:55.121
I couldn't sleep,
so I did some improvising

33:55.123 --> 33:58.427
and that's my audience.

34:01.663 --> 34:03.565
Were you pretending
to be my grandmother?

34:06.234 --> 34:08.570
No, mine.

34:19.748 --> 34:22.181
Is that you and your parents?

34:22.183 --> 34:23.251
Mm-hmm.

34:24.252 --> 34:25.585
Are they gone?

34:27.321 --> 34:29.288
Mm-hmm.

34:29.290 --> 34:32.726
Car accident, not long
after that picture was taken.

34:39.734 --> 34:41.302
Do you remember it?

34:43.804 --> 34:45.639
I mean, I remember the...

34:48.775 --> 34:51.545
The sounds of
their suffering mostly.

34:55.248 --> 34:56.417
How'd it happen?

35:00.454 --> 35:04.255
Went over the edge
driving up in the mountains

35:04.257 --> 35:08.259
and it took them about
three days to find us,

35:08.261 --> 35:10.698
which is about how long it
took for my parents to die.

35:14.301 --> 35:15.770
Is that your grandma?

35:20.140 --> 35:21.408
Yeah.

35:23.343 --> 35:24.578
Yeah, that's her.

35:30.785 --> 35:32.719
I'm not a real person.

35:34.688 --> 35:39.457
That's why I'm addicted to it,
because I'm...

35:39.459 --> 35:43.496
I'm nothing
without the attention.

35:46.466 --> 35:48.399
It's like a drug,
where you just,

35:48.401 --> 35:53.338
you need more and more
and more and...

35:53.340 --> 35:55.508
Eventually...

35:59.646 --> 36:03.617
Eventually you don't care
what you gotta do to get it.

36:05.317 --> 36:08.622
Oxy.
You gotta be kidding me.

36:11.290 --> 36:14.159
And when everything
else is gone, then...

36:16.562 --> 36:18.765
The hope is the last
thing that you lose.

36:24.670 --> 36:28.108
And if there's no one around
to help you get it back, then...

36:34.546 --> 36:36.715
I mean, you might as
well just give up.

37:35.873 --> 37:37.840
I'm not gonna give you guys
stupid names

37:37.842 --> 37:40.543
like wilbur and babe.

37:40.545 --> 37:43.815
You are Eric
and you are Christine.

38:14.377 --> 38:16.413
You scumbag.

38:20.383 --> 38:22.784
Open up!

38:22.786 --> 38:24.352
Hey!

38:24.354 --> 38:26.523
Open up!
Open the door!

38:27.557 --> 38:28.923
Hey!

38:28.925 --> 38:31.760
Found your camera, perv.
You were spying on me.

38:31.762 --> 38:34.596
I didn't... I didn't have time
to take them down.

38:34.598 --> 38:37.031
That's your excuse?

38:37.033 --> 38:39.067
Wait, I'm sorry, "them"?
How many are there?

38:39.069 --> 38:40.769
One in...
There's one in each...

38:40.771 --> 38:42.437
There's one in each room.

38:42.439 --> 38:44.606
Is this why I'm here,
so that you can film

38:44.608 --> 38:48.543
some markey marlowe
voyeur peep show shit?

38:48.545 --> 38:50.411
No, they're not
even hooked up.

38:50.413 --> 38:51.613
If I break my ankle monitor,

38:51.615 --> 38:52.847
the cops will be here
within five minutes.

38:52.849 --> 38:53.948
No, stop, don't, don't.

38:53.950 --> 38:55.284
Please.

38:56.352 --> 38:57.353
Please.

38:58.822 --> 39:00.557
I'll show you.

39:01.992 --> 39:04.125
This is the dvr for
the cameras right here

39:04.127 --> 39:06.761
and you can see none of
the cables are plugged in.

39:06.763 --> 39:09.596
All the cables are just
lying here on top of the dvr.

39:09.598 --> 39:11.431
Or you were watching
me in the bathtub,

39:11.433 --> 39:13.634
saw me find the camera,
and disconnected everything

39:13.636 --> 39:15.569
before I came over.

39:15.571 --> 39:17.005
I don't know how else
to prove it to you.

39:17.007 --> 39:19.974
Why do you even have them?

39:19.976 --> 39:21.644
So I could watch
my grandmother.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.649
You watched your grandmother
go to the bathroom?

39:27.750 --> 39:29.950
- That's gross.
- No, I...

39:29.952 --> 39:32.052
Statistically speaking,
that's where the elderly

39:32.054 --> 39:33.954
die the most often.

39:33.956 --> 39:35.756
And she didn't want to
be a burden,

39:35.758 --> 39:37.090
but I wanted
to watch over her,

39:37.092 --> 39:38.761
so installed the
cameras without her knowing.

39:42.932 --> 39:44.598
Did she die in the bathroom?

39:44.600 --> 39:45.899
No, in the bed.

39:45.901 --> 39:47.570
My bed?

39:49.839 --> 39:51.004
I had everything cleaned...

39:51.006 --> 39:52.541
I wanna see her.

40:02.184 --> 40:04.920
I wish grandma Addie
had lived to be that old.

40:08.756 --> 40:10.658
She never got
to look like a grandma.

40:16.198 --> 40:18.766
How much footage did you keep?

40:19.734 --> 40:21.070
All of it.

40:27.041 --> 40:28.810
You should make a documentary.

40:30.612 --> 40:32.845
Final days of
a dying proud woman.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.049
That's, like, some Oscar
shit right there.

40:36.885 --> 40:38.985
I'd have to change the ending.

40:38.987 --> 40:41.053
Why?

40:41.055 --> 40:45.059
I mean she dies.
That's what it's all about.

40:47.629 --> 40:50.029
I love films where the main
character dies at the end.

40:50.031 --> 40:54.634
Isn't that what we all do?
Die at the end?

40:54.636 --> 40:56.802
Still, I'd have
to change the ending.

40:56.804 --> 40:58.706
Do you believe me
about the cameras?

41:02.944 --> 41:04.611
Haven't decided.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.886
Okay.

41:14.888 --> 41:18.024
What do we do?
What more can I do for you?

41:18.026 --> 41:20.094
You can make me trust you.

41:22.629 --> 41:25.597
I have a clip here of you...

41:25.599 --> 41:27.768
That's worth
seven figures, maybe.

41:29.169 --> 41:31.002
All I'd have to do
is call the tabloids,

41:31.004 --> 41:32.704
and they would
go crazy over it.

41:32.706 --> 41:34.639
So sell it to them.

41:34.641 --> 41:37.676
I would never sell it.

41:37.678 --> 41:38.843
Why not?

41:38.845 --> 41:41.081
My ex boyfriend
sold our sex tape.

41:43.550 --> 41:45.451
It's funny
that you should mention Nick.

41:49.890 --> 41:52.757
I used to collect
footage of celebrities.

41:52.759 --> 41:55.727
You're really killing it on the
getting-me-to-trust-you thing.

41:55.729 --> 41:57.996
I thought
that if I could figure out

41:57.998 --> 42:00.832
why some people
need attention so badly,

42:00.834 --> 42:03.703
like it justifies their very
existence, maybe I could...

42:05.705 --> 42:09.575
Ah, so you must have like
a shitload of footage of me.

42:16.649 --> 42:18.116
Where did you get this?

42:18.118 --> 42:19.252
I shot it.

42:23.089 --> 42:24.924
- You're a paparazzi?
- No.

42:26.892 --> 42:28.225
Once I figured out
that all the stuff

42:28.227 --> 42:29.593
I was collecting off
the TV and Internet

42:29.595 --> 42:30.794
was mostly PR bullshit,

42:30.796 --> 42:34.298
I decided to
collect them myself.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.600
I wanted to get
the candid moments

42:36.602 --> 42:38.504
that the paparazzi rarely see.

42:42.942 --> 42:45.144
How did it feel
being in the crowd?

42:48.781 --> 42:51.017
It's easier with the camera.

42:53.585 --> 42:55.888
People look at it
instead of me.

42:58.757 --> 43:00.292
I'm invisible behind it.

43:10.369 --> 43:12.171
Do you remember that night?

43:17.075 --> 43:18.743
Just another party.

43:27.152 --> 43:28.753
How much did you get?

43:30.321 --> 43:32.722
All of it.

43:32.724 --> 43:34.190
You don't have to watch it
if you don't want.

43:34.192 --> 43:35.627
No, I wanna see it.

43:45.403 --> 43:47.571
How'd you know we'd
be in the alley?

43:51.142 --> 43:53.042
You all arrived
in the same limo,

43:53.044 --> 43:54.977
so when I saw Sydney
leaving the front,

43:54.979 --> 43:58.782
I figured you must be sneaking
out the back for some reason.

44:01.852 --> 44:03.121
They set me up.

44:06.224 --> 44:07.656
They thought it'd be fun

44:07.658 --> 44:11.394
to see me have
a public meltdown

44:11.396 --> 44:14.863
when they told me
that my best friend Sydney

44:14.865 --> 44:17.199
and my boyfriend Nick
had been screwing

44:17.201 --> 44:19.002
behind my back for months.

44:22.272 --> 44:23.839
They even made bets
whether or not

44:23.841 --> 44:25.342
I'd go to
jail that night.

44:33.016 --> 44:35.183
Why didn't you
call the police?

44:35.185 --> 44:36.320
Why didn't you?

44:42.326 --> 44:44.161
Yeah, that would
have gone over great.

44:46.830 --> 44:48.296
The police would have
leaked it to the press,

44:48.298 --> 44:52.000
and the tabloids would have
spun whatever story

44:52.002 --> 44:56.404
and somehow it would
end up being my fault,

44:56.406 --> 44:58.908
that I was asking for it or...

45:00.943 --> 45:03.946
...i made it up
to get attention.

45:11.888 --> 45:13.089
What are you doing?

45:15.425 --> 45:19.228
Do you have any idea how
beautiful you are right now?

45:25.268 --> 45:26.734
Yeah, whatever.

45:26.736 --> 45:27.803
No, look.

45:31.340 --> 45:35.876
That's you without a mask on.

45:35.878 --> 45:39.982
Pure, raw emotion.

45:51.760 --> 45:56.896
Why would I ever share
what's inside of myself,

45:56.898 --> 46:00.436
when all of my life I've been
taught how worthless it is?

46:02.238 --> 46:03.939
How do you feel right now?

46:10.845 --> 46:13.048
Like a pathetic piece of shit.

46:23.526 --> 46:24.893
Worthless.

46:27.028 --> 46:29.097
So now what do you
wanna do about it?

46:36.972 --> 46:40.006
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

46:40.008 --> 46:43.409
You didn't do anything
when Nick raped you.

46:43.411 --> 46:45.844
You just took it,

46:45.846 --> 46:49.850
and now you feel like a pathetic
piece of shit and worthless.

46:51.286 --> 46:54.356
So now what do you
wanna do about it?

47:00.127 --> 47:01.363
It's like whatever.

47:03.465 --> 47:06.332
Do you remember
when you told me

47:06.334 --> 47:09.003
you wished that I would
have punched Nick's teeth in?

47:12.006 --> 47:14.141
You got off on that,
didn't you?

47:18.045 --> 47:19.446
So say it again.

47:24.318 --> 47:27.919
I want you to punch
Nick's teeth in.

47:27.921 --> 47:31.091
No, be real.

47:42.469 --> 47:45.504
I want you...

47:45.506 --> 47:49.043
To punch Nick's teeth
in for me.

47:53.147 --> 47:57.249
Good, now I want you
to imagine it,

47:57.251 --> 47:59.085
all in detail.

48:12.633 --> 48:14.501
Nick's got this...

48:16.603 --> 48:20.306
Gold implant
with a diamond...

48:24.243 --> 48:27.678
And I was just thinking
how good it would look

48:27.680 --> 48:29.582
hanging around my neck.

50:26.497 --> 50:29.498
I think you should take these
before I do something stupid.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.400
Oh, I'm sorry,

50:31.402 --> 50:32.701
I thought
I cleaned everything up.

50:32.703 --> 50:34.538
It's cool.
Annie missed them too.

50:35.539 --> 50:37.105
Thank you.

50:37.107 --> 50:40.144
Could you film me
some more?

50:42.111 --> 50:43.647
It makes me feel better.

51:01.130 --> 51:03.464
You like watching what's
going on in that bedroom?

51:03.466 --> 51:05.502
Don't invade their privacy.

51:07.605 --> 51:09.738
Seriously?

51:09.740 --> 51:11.572
Next you're gonna tell me

51:11.574 --> 51:13.443
you haven't been watching me
sunbathe in my underwear.

51:14.611 --> 51:16.210
I haven't.

51:16.212 --> 51:17.678
Why not?

51:17.680 --> 51:19.480
I only watch people in public,

51:19.482 --> 51:21.117
when they should
expect to be watched.

51:22.552 --> 51:25.419
Your grandma didn't
expect to be watched.

51:25.421 --> 51:26.689
That's...

51:28.458 --> 51:31.192
She needed to be watched.

51:31.194 --> 51:32.328
So do I.

51:35.832 --> 51:37.865
Could you look
at this, actually?

51:37.867 --> 51:41.571
I think it might be infected.
I don't know.

51:44.374 --> 51:46.776
You can keep recording if it
makes you more comfortable.

51:51.681 --> 51:53.750
Could you cover up, please?

51:55.384 --> 51:56.751
I don't know if it's infected,

51:56.753 --> 51:59.121
but you definitely do
need a new bandage.

52:00.355 --> 52:02.357
- And a water too.
- Mm-hmm.

52:56.578 --> 53:00.546
Would you go out tonight
and...

53:00.548 --> 53:02.416
Film something for me?

53:21.302 --> 53:23.702
Why are you sneaking out?

53:23.704 --> 53:25.404
I didn't wanna see you
get your hopes up

53:25.406 --> 53:27.842
only to disappoint you,
like with the bears.

53:31.846 --> 53:34.147
I don't think
you'll disappoint me.

53:35.816 --> 53:37.281
Go to the rude bar.

53:37.283 --> 53:39.687
There's always something
happening there.

54:50.023 --> 54:52.890
It's hard taking
care of someone you love

54:52.892 --> 54:55.559
when they're dying,

54:55.561 --> 54:57.694
especially when they're
the only one

54:57.696 --> 54:59.763
you have left in the world.

54:59.765 --> 55:01.633
It takes over your life.

55:02.634 --> 55:03.802
It is your life.

55:05.504 --> 55:07.871
Nothing else matters.

55:07.873 --> 55:10.507
You'd do anything
and everything for them,

55:10.509 --> 55:13.777
even if it's something
you don't wanna do.

55:13.779 --> 55:16.379
But you do it anyway,

55:16.381 --> 55:18.782
'cause you know it's important,

55:18.784 --> 55:21.553
because it's what they want.

56:08.666 --> 56:10.399
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

56:10.401 --> 56:13.437
No, I was waiting up.
Did you get some good stuff?

56:17.041 --> 56:19.675
I think so.

56:19.677 --> 56:20.943
Your bff made an appearance

56:20.945 --> 56:22.845
at the rude bar tonight.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.847
Yeah, she's addicted
to their pixie sticks

56:24.849 --> 56:26.884
and their paparazzi.

56:28.119 --> 56:29.919
Was Nick there?

56:29.921 --> 56:32.723
I didn't see him,
but I wasn't there very long.

56:38.395 --> 56:39.762
Sydney, Sydney.

56:39.764 --> 56:41.130
Do you know where
markey's holed up?

56:41.132 --> 56:42.665
"Do I care"
is a better question.

56:42.667 --> 56:43.966
Any thoughts about her
possibly going to jail?

56:43.968 --> 56:47.404
I hope...

56:48.405 --> 56:50.773
What... what did she say?

56:50.775 --> 56:53.042
I couldn't hear it.

56:53.044 --> 56:57.081
She said, "I don't care"
and then something else to this.

56:58.481 --> 56:59.749
You're good at that.

57:03.486 --> 57:05.120
Any thoughts about her
possibly going to jail?

57:05.122 --> 57:08.056
I hope...

57:08.058 --> 57:10.525
And then something about a...

57:10.527 --> 57:11.960
Like a broomstick
or something.

57:11.962 --> 57:14.164
Why is she so lame?

57:18.034 --> 57:19.634
I don't know what
I'd like to do more

57:19.636 --> 57:20.735
when she does that,

57:20.737 --> 57:23.004
break every one of her fingers

57:23.006 --> 57:27.110
or rip out every hair
on that empty head.

57:28.578 --> 57:30.080
But if you had to choose?

58:17.092 --> 58:19.061
All right, markey,
you can do this.

58:33.142 --> 58:35.510
Your grandma didn't
expect to be watched.

58:38.881 --> 58:42.217
That's different.
She needed to be watched.

58:48.556 --> 58:50.591
She needed to be watched.

58:55.264 --> 58:57.596
Could you look
at this, actually?

58:57.598 --> 58:59.534
I think it might be infected.

59:04.605 --> 59:06.208
And a water too.

59:51.685 --> 59:54.819
So you can see
the light of day?

59:54.821 --> 59:59.693
I'm not a peeping Tom.
I'm not a vampire either.

01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:02.529
What do you think?

01:00:04.197 --> 01:00:07.267
It's not real,
but it suits you.

01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:09.770
Thank you.

01:00:12.773 --> 01:00:15.008
I found out what Sydney
said about you last night.

01:00:23.784 --> 01:00:26.017
Sydney! You know
where markey's holed up?

01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:27.986
"Do I care"
is a better question.

01:00:27.988 --> 01:00:29.788
Any thoughts about her
possibly going to jail?

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:31.156
Oh, I hope some dyke

01:00:31.158 --> 01:00:33.193
rapes that bitch
with a broomstick.

01:00:52.812 --> 01:00:55.714
What did I do to deserve that?

01:01:06.025 --> 01:01:08.859
You know, I haven't seen...

01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:11.263
My dad in five years.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.933
And my mom and Jade,

01:01:15.935 --> 01:01:17.703
they stopped coming
to my court hearings...

01:01:19.205 --> 01:01:21.171
Way before
the restraining order,

01:01:21.173 --> 01:01:25.976
because they were worried
that the negative press

01:01:25.978 --> 01:01:31.851
would hurt sweet little
Jade's budding career.

01:01:45.231 --> 01:01:47.797
Did you know
that there was a...

01:01:47.799 --> 01:01:50.300
There's a gambling site
online

01:01:50.302 --> 01:01:54.438
that takes bets
on how I'm gonna die.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.172
Did you hear this?

01:01:56.174 --> 01:01:58.107
No.

01:01:58.109 --> 01:02:02.111
The choices were...

01:02:02.113 --> 01:02:03.346
Car accident,

01:02:03.348 --> 01:02:05.183
car accident
under the influence...

01:02:07.986 --> 01:02:11.254
Accidental overdose,

01:02:11.256 --> 01:02:14.490
suicide, pretty corpse,

01:02:14.492 --> 01:02:17.894
suicide, ugly corpse,

01:02:17.896 --> 01:02:19.764
and murdered by stalker.

01:02:27.804 --> 01:02:30.408
God, what I'd like to
do to that bitch Sydney.

01:02:31.976 --> 01:02:33.344
You already chose.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.074
Bye!

01:04:22.918 --> 01:04:26.122
Bye, thank you all.
See you again tomorrow.

01:04:37.433 --> 01:04:38.465
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:04:38.467 --> 01:04:41.036
One... no, no!

01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:48.941
- Ahh...
- Don't you just love oxy?

01:04:48.943 --> 01:04:50.877
Oh, when did we take oxy?

01:04:57.218 --> 01:05:00.086
It was in your pixie sticks.

01:05:04.626 --> 01:05:08.361
Oh my god, party drugs
in pixie sticks!

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.065
Why didn't I think of that?

01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:16.504
How can we thank you?

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.979
I wanna go out big...

01:05:27.981 --> 01:05:29.351
Like Marilyn.

01:05:34.689 --> 01:05:36.023
Then I'll help you.

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.462
I'll make sure
they remember you.

01:05:47.134 --> 01:05:48.369
Where am I?

01:05:52.272 --> 01:05:53.641
How did I get here?

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:58.176
You're not very heavy.

01:05:58.178 --> 01:05:59.444
Thank you.

01:05:59.446 --> 01:06:02.414
Seriously, though,
why am I here?

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:06.485
You traded your safety
for fame.

01:06:06.487 --> 01:06:08.987
You're here because your
publicist tells the paparazzi

01:06:08.989 --> 01:06:10.655
what you're doing
every minute of every day.

01:06:10.657 --> 01:06:12.657
It's all out there
for the world to see,

01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:15.360
right down to the routine
you do when you come home.

01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:17.295
Okay,
if you know me so well,

01:06:17.297 --> 01:06:19.066
why'd you go through
all this trouble?

01:06:21.168 --> 01:06:25.103
Everybody knows
I am freaky.

01:06:25.105 --> 01:06:28.208
I can do you any way you want.

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:31.710
Unless this isn't
what you wanted.

01:06:31.712 --> 01:06:34.013
Also, you betrayed your friend.

01:06:44.525 --> 01:06:46.157
Look.

01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:47.626
Sydney, do you know
where markey's holed up?

01:06:47.628 --> 01:06:49.994
"Do I care"
is a better question.

01:06:49.996 --> 01:06:51.529
Any thoughts about her
possibly going to jail?

01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:54.633
I hope some dyke rapes
that bitch with a broomstick.

01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:57.468
What?

01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:01.138
This is about
markey marlowe?

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.608
No one cares about that bitch.

01:07:04.143 --> 01:07:06.343
I can give you a lot more
than she can.

01:07:06.345 --> 01:07:08.147
I doubt that very much.

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:13.184
I don't know
what I wanna do more to her

01:07:13.186 --> 01:07:14.285
when she does that,

01:07:14.287 --> 01:07:16.320
break every one
of those fingers

01:07:16.322 --> 01:07:19.790
or rip every hair
out of that empty head.

01:07:19.792 --> 01:07:21.727
What do you think
she chose, Sydney?

01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:30.233
Murdered by stalker.

01:07:30.235 --> 01:07:33.471
That's the one it has to be.

01:07:33.473 --> 01:07:37.140
Whatever you're doing,
keep doing it.

01:07:37.142 --> 01:07:40.109
Ow! What are you doing?

01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:42.378
An accident or a suicide

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.181
doesn't have the impact
that you need.

01:07:45.183 --> 01:07:47.818
And then I'd
be the one to blame.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.321
You don't understand, Sydney.

01:07:50.489 --> 01:07:51.757
She chose hair.

01:07:53.191 --> 01:07:54.693
But if a stalker kills you...

01:07:56.228 --> 01:07:58.394
It means obsession.

01:07:58.396 --> 01:08:00.597
Markey chose to rip every
hair out of your empty head.

01:08:00.599 --> 01:08:03.266
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Please!

01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:04.667
No, no!

01:08:04.669 --> 01:08:06.736
Stop, please!

01:08:06.738 --> 01:08:09.839
It means a want so great

01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:12.108
that you'd do
anything it takes

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:13.710
to posses the object of desire.

01:08:13.712 --> 01:08:15.678
No, no, no, please, wait!

01:08:18.283 --> 01:08:19.849
...even if
it means destroying it.

01:08:23.622 --> 01:08:25.388
You'd be like
a character in a movie.

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:35.600
Everyone loves me as long
as I'm being someone else.

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:17.474

How would your grandma

01:09:48.404 --> 01:09:49.639
It would have killed her.

01:09:51.741 --> 01:09:54.508
How would your grandma feel?

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:56.613
This isn't about me.

01:09:58.848 --> 01:10:00.450
What about your father?

01:10:09.826 --> 01:10:11.294
Forget about him...

01:10:13.496 --> 01:10:15.365
...just like
he forgot about me.

01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:19.702
What about your mother?

01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:35.484
Damn paparazzi.

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:01.441
- No, no!
- Don't, don't, don't!

01:11:01.443 --> 01:11:04.377
Don't scream.

01:11:04.379 --> 01:11:05.881
I have enough tape
for your mouth.

01:11:07.649 --> 01:11:10.417
Your daughter told me
not to hurt you.

01:11:10.419 --> 01:11:11.753
Do you understand?

01:11:15.857 --> 01:11:18.660
Where is she?
Where is Jade?

01:11:20.395 --> 01:11:22.431
Your other daughter
told me not to hurt you.

01:11:24.566 --> 01:11:26.465
Do you remember markey?

01:11:26.467 --> 01:11:28.835
Where's Jade?

01:11:28.837 --> 01:11:30.637
If only you cared
about markey a fraction

01:11:30.639 --> 01:11:32.872
about how much
you care about your Jade.

01:11:32.874 --> 01:11:34.040
You don't know shit.

01:11:34.042 --> 01:11:36.243
Oh, but I do.
I know a lot.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.446
I know that it's true
you only had Jade

01:11:40.448 --> 01:11:41.848
because you were worried
about markey's career

01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:44.951
coming to an end,
didn't you?

01:11:44.953 --> 01:11:47.788
Where is she?
Where is Jade?

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.033
Jade!

01:12:01.035 --> 01:12:02.470
Stop, stop!

01:12:05.306 --> 01:12:06.540
Don't scream.

01:12:08.075 --> 01:12:10.943
I swear to god,
you better not hurt her!

01:12:10.945 --> 01:12:12.413
You hear me?

01:12:13.514 --> 01:12:14.515
Jade!

01:12:18.318 --> 01:12:19.319
Jadie.

01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:27.628
You should never have abandoned
markey like that, Cara.

01:12:28.829 --> 01:12:31.899
First her father,
then her mother.

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:38.103
Look at you,
you little pussy.

01:12:38.105 --> 01:12:41.907
You can't even look me in
the eye, can you, you loser?

01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:44.910
Abandonment
is the worst thing

01:12:44.912 --> 01:12:46.379
that a parent
can do to a child,

01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:51.484
that's unforgivable.

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:56.921
But markey wanted
some requital.

01:12:56.923 --> 01:13:01.592
No, no, no!

01:13:01.594 --> 01:13:03.561
I wanna see
the look on Cara's face

01:13:03.563 --> 01:13:06.733
when something happens to her
pretty little piece of Jade.

01:13:12.438 --> 01:13:14.972
Nothing else matters.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:17.642
You'd do anything
and everything for them,

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:19.846
even if it's something
you don't wanna do.

01:13:22.581 --> 01:13:24.749
But you do it anyway,

01:13:24.751 --> 01:13:26.853
because you know
it's important,

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:30.023
because it's what they want.

01:13:36.795 --> 01:13:39.863
I told you I'd have
to change the ending.

01:13:39.865 --> 01:13:41.100
It's perfect.

01:13:44.603 --> 01:13:46.039
What were you talking about?

01:13:48.574 --> 01:13:50.707
She was ready to go,

01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:54.444
but she couldn't stop
her body from struggling.

01:13:54.446 --> 01:13:58.548
Her body still had
this basic primal will to live.

01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:03.987
I couldn't just restrain her
or simply overpower her.

01:14:03.989 --> 01:14:07.157
It would have left marks
all over her body,

01:14:07.159 --> 01:14:09.893
and the police would have
known that I killed her,

01:14:09.895 --> 01:14:11.862
so the only way
for it to work was for her

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:15.999
to just lie there and
wait for it to happen.

01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:17.970
It took over an hour.

01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:21.139
I know, I watched it all.

01:14:26.945 --> 01:14:31.415
It's beautiful
and so are your words.

01:14:34.652 --> 01:14:38.422
I hope the film that you
make for me is this beautiful.

01:14:43.761 --> 01:14:45.429
How are you gonna kill me?

01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:49.800
Any way you want.

01:15:59.669 --> 01:16:02.005
I don't want you
to shoot the ending.

01:16:06.843 --> 01:16:09.145
I want them to
wonder what happened.

01:16:12.015 --> 01:16:13.717
What about Annie?

01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:23.257
Daryl, are you there?

01:16:23.259 --> 01:16:26.160
This is Annie,
markey's assistant.

01:16:26.162 --> 01:16:31.165
Listen, something happened
that markey needs to know about.

01:16:31.167 --> 01:16:32.899
I'm coming right over.

01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:35.904
Markey? It's Annie.

01:16:58.794 --> 01:17:00.796
Oh, my poor girl.

01:17:18.646 --> 01:17:22.550
Markey, are you up there?

01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:33.226
Markey?

01:18:14.135 --> 01:18:17.269
I knew you'd look
good with bangs.

01:18:19.006 --> 01:18:21.040
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:18:21.042 --> 01:18:23.710
I panicked,
and I didn't know what to do.

01:18:25.213 --> 01:18:28.780
I'm gonna take
the tape off of your mouth.

01:18:28.782 --> 01:18:31.885
I'm asking
my very-well-paid assistant...

01:18:34.788 --> 01:18:37.088
And my best friend

01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:38.959
to please keep it down.

01:18:40.927 --> 01:18:43.230
I'm trying to keep her safe.

01:18:45.165 --> 01:18:47.667
Have you completely lost it?

01:18:51.271 --> 01:18:53.707
Stop screwing around
and listen to me.

01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:57.075
Someone attacked
Jade and your mom.

01:18:57.077 --> 01:18:59.444
Mm-hmm.

01:18:59.446 --> 01:19:01.813
Stop it!
You're freaking me out, markey.

01:19:01.815 --> 01:19:04.415
I'm in control

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:07.485
and he won't hurt you
as long as you stay out of it.

01:19:07.487 --> 01:19:09.990
- It's almost done.
- What's almost done?

01:19:11.992 --> 01:19:15.193
We both agreed
that if I was to be remembered,

01:19:15.195 --> 01:19:17.763
like Marilyn,
I'd have to go out big.

01:19:24.937 --> 01:19:26.173
He's back.

01:19:28.908 --> 01:19:31.442
You just stay right here,

01:19:31.444 --> 01:19:33.246
and it'll all be over soon.

01:20:05.511 --> 01:20:07.379
No, no cameras, please.

01:20:14.786 --> 01:20:16.188
And turn off the monitor.

01:20:24.128 --> 01:20:27.433
There, that's better.

01:20:29.468 --> 01:20:30.969
Isn't that better?

01:20:33.339 --> 01:20:34.973
That's me...

01:20:37.842 --> 01:20:43.513
Not some video
of some other room

01:20:43.515 --> 01:20:49.454
in some other place,
but... that's me...

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:53.424
Right there in front of you.

01:20:59.130 --> 01:21:03.832
People look at me like
I'm some kind of mirror,

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:07.169
and all they see
is their own fantasy

01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:08.439
and then...

01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:13.444
And then they tell me I'm the
one living the fantasy...

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.615
When it's their own words
coming out of my mouth

01:21:19.617 --> 01:21:23.554
and their lewd thoughts wrapping
their hands around my neck.

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:39.403
That's what I see.

01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:43.573
A shape...

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.045
An object.

01:21:52.549 --> 01:21:54.051
I'm pretty...

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.989
But I'm not beautiful.

01:22:08.498 --> 01:22:12.200
There's a million little
girls out there all alone,

01:22:12.202 --> 01:22:14.402
wishing that they
could become movie stars

01:22:14.404 --> 01:22:17.207
and I'm the one that wished
the hardest and here I am.

01:22:19.175 --> 01:22:22.546
I wished so hard that everything
became make believe...

01:22:25.382 --> 01:22:26.949
Even me.

01:22:33.089 --> 01:22:34.288
I don't want you
to shoot the ending,

01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:36.325
because I want it
to be a mystery.

01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:48.170
I am so tired of waking up.

01:22:50.606 --> 01:22:55.144
I just wanna dream forever
and sleep forever.

01:23:00.449 --> 01:23:01.615
No, no, no!
