WEBVTT

00:05.335 --> 00:07.002
Peter, come on, it's
time to wake up.

00:07.020 --> 00:08.604
You got to get to work.

00:08.638 --> 00:10.489
Uh, Lois, I ain't feeling good.

00:10.523 --> 00:12.257
Peter, what happened
to your voice?

00:12.292 --> 00:14.192
It-It's so deep.

00:14.227 --> 00:15.661
I think I'm sick.

00:15.695 --> 00:17.529
Well, you don't
sound like yourself.

00:17.563 --> 00:20.732
In fact, you sound
kind of hot.

00:20.767 --> 00:23.335
I just threw up
two chicken gyros out my nose.

00:23.369 --> 00:24.803
They're on your side of the bed.

00:24.837 --> 00:26.872
Oh, say that again.

00:28.224 --> 00:30.559
But I want you to
keep talking to me

00:30.593 --> 00:32.302
in that sexy voice
while we do it.

00:32.455 --> 00:35.443
Okay great. Let's pretend
you're a tollbooth worker

00:35.468 --> 00:36.857
and I'm molesting you.

00:36.858 --> 00:38.059
Okay.

00:38.093 --> 00:39.627
I don't have any change.

00:39.661 --> 00:40.928
Now take off that parka.

00:40.962 --> 00:42.096
Uh-uh-uh.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.764
You're gonna have
to pay a high to

00:43.799 --> 00:45.700
if you want to get
into this tunnel.

00:45.734 --> 00:47.568
Come on,
don't say stuff like that.

00:47.602 --> 00:50.071
I want you to be scared,
not make puns.

01:05.887 --> 01:07.204
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

01:07.239 --> 01:08.672
For those of you who turned out

01:08.707 --> 01:11.375
to see my stand-up comedy debut
at Zany's last night,

01:11.410 --> 01:14.245
I again apologize
for what I said about Moroccans.

01:14.279 --> 01:15.646
But today's breaking news

01:15.680 --> 01:17.548
is that the New England Toy
and Game Company

01:17.582 --> 01:20.217
has issued an immediate recall
of all of its stuffed bears,

01:20.252 --> 01:21.752
like the one shown here.

01:21.787 --> 01:23.854
The bear's eyes
can become easily detached

01:23.889 --> 01:26.323
and pose a potential
choking hazard.

01:26.358 --> 01:29.160
Oh, my God, that's the same
teddy bear Stewie has.

01:29.194 --> 01:31.145
We got to send that thing
back right away.

01:31.179 --> 01:32.613
Boy, I wonder
if there's anything more

01:32.647 --> 01:34.165
on Channel Two about this.

01:34.199 --> 01:36.967
Our top story, Channel Five
News anchor, Tom Tucker,

01:37.002 --> 01:40.004
has a meltdown
at a local comedy club.

01:40.038 --> 01:41.922
Look at you, you fat,
gross Moroccans

01:41.957 --> 01:44.175
with your ooga-booga food.

01:48.997 --> 01:51.665
Oh, my God, that
was amazing.

01:51.683 --> 01:53.634
I'm gonna have to
crawl to the bathroom.

01:53.668 --> 01:55.352
Yeah, that was incredible.

01:55.387 --> 01:57.254
It was the first time
I had an orgasm

01:57.289 --> 01:58.856
out the front and back.

01:58.890 --> 02:01.992
God, Peter, this voice of
yours is really something.

02:02.027 --> 02:03.811
Oh, I can't get
enough of it.

02:03.845 --> 02:05.346
Yeah, it's been pretty great.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.214
You know,
I even won a deep voice contest

02:07.249 --> 02:09.133
with Joe yesterday.

02:11.987 --> 02:13.020
I heard you coming.

02:13.054 --> 02:14.221
I made myself heard.

02:14.256 --> 02:15.322
Where have you come from?

02:15.357 --> 02:16.590
I've come from
where I've been.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.359
You still riding with that
mangy polecat Fletcher?

02:18.393 --> 02:19.994
Fletcher met the
long arm of the law

02:20.028 --> 02:22.897
at the wrong end of a shotgun
and the deep end of a grave

02:22.931 --> 02:24.582
at the far end of
a dead-end road.

02:24.616 --> 02:26.617
Winner!

02:28.220 --> 02:29.837
Well, I should
probably get going.

02:29.871 --> 02:31.972
Me, Joe and Quagmire
are going bowling again.

02:32.007 --> 02:33.941
We got a big tournament
coming up next week.

02:33.975 --> 02:35.543
Well, hurry
back, handsome.

02:35.577 --> 02:37.595
Oh, Peter, this
is so much fun.

02:37.629 --> 02:39.447
I feel like I have
a secret lover

02:39.481 --> 02:40.865
nobody else knows about.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.600
Just like Carly Simon.

02:42.634 --> 02:44.502
Ms. Simon, enough
years have gone by

02:44.536 --> 02:46.837
since you wrote your classic
hit, "You're So Vain."

02:46.872 --> 02:48.739
Don't you think it's
time to tell the world

02:48.773 --> 02:50.608
who that song was
written about?

02:50.642 --> 02:54.328
No. That will always be a secret
between me and him.

02:54.362 --> 02:58.532
♪ You're so vain

02:58.567 --> 03:01.719
♪ You probably think this song
is about you ♪

03:01.753 --> 03:05.489
♪ You're so vain
♪ <i>You're so vain.</i> ♪

03:08.527 --> 03:09.910
Come on, Rupert, let's go.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.378
This is the first day
we're allowed

03:11.412 --> 03:12.596
to the end of the driveway,

03:12.631 --> 03:14.532
and I intend
to take full advantage.

03:14.566 --> 03:16.484
Rupert?

03:18.253 --> 03:20.054
Rupert?

03:21.256 --> 03:22.506
Hey, what's going on?

03:22.541 --> 03:24.058
Brian, I can't find
Rupert anywhere.

03:24.092 --> 03:25.176
Have you seen him?

03:25.210 --> 03:26.577
Oh, I thought Lois
would've told you.

03:26.611 --> 03:28.112
She sent him back
to the factory.

03:28.146 --> 03:29.313
What? Why?!

03:29.364 --> 03:30.844
She was afraid he
was gonna choke you.

03:30.866 --> 03:32.049
Oh, that was
a game we played.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.803
Believe me,
I was in control the whole time.

03:33.835 --> 03:35.236
No, the company
issued a recall.

03:35.270 --> 03:36.620
But don't worry, they
sent a replacement.

03:36.655 --> 03:37.805
Here, the guy just
delivered it.

03:37.839 --> 03:38.939
Replacement?

03:40.942 --> 03:42.610
What the hell is this?

03:42.644 --> 03:45.045
What? Come on,
he's a cute little giraffe.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.131
Maybe you could call him,
like, Gizmo or something.

03:47.165 --> 03:48.849
Oh, look, he can fly.

03:48.884 --> 03:50.684
Whoosh.

03:50.719 --> 03:51.952
I hate him.

03:51.987 --> 03:53.938
His mouth is always open
like P. Diddy.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.139
Well, what do you mean?

03:55.173 --> 03:57.208
You ever notice how
in every photo of P. Diddy,

03:57.242 --> 03:58.726
his mouth is hanging open?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.345
Well, actually, Diddy hired a
guy to close his mouth for him.

04:01.379 --> 04:03.964
I'm telling you, this kid
is the next Justin Bieber.

04:03.999 --> 04:06.200
Young girls love him, but
he makes real music that...

04:06.234 --> 04:07.384
Sorry I'm late.

04:07.419 --> 04:08.686
Traffic.

04:11.890 --> 04:13.557
Good morning, Lois!

04:13.592 --> 04:15.025
How's it going, Brian?

04:15.060 --> 04:17.278
Peter, what happened
to your voice?

04:17.312 --> 04:18.846
Oh, ho, ho.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.115
You know what happened,
you sexy minx.

04:21.149 --> 04:23.551
My white blood cells
attacked the pathogens

04:23.585 --> 04:25.753
and created antibodies,
and then the pathogens

04:25.787 --> 04:28.055
were filtered out
by my kidneys into my urine

04:28.089 --> 04:30.874
and then expelled from my body,
you slut.

04:30.926 --> 04:32.359
Peter, not now.

04:32.394 --> 04:33.460
What the hell, Lois?

04:33.495 --> 04:34.762
Yesterday you were
all over me.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.131
And then, for a confusing
period, inside of me.

04:37.165 --> 04:40.000
I had no control over what
I did yesterday, Peter.

04:40.035 --> 04:41.769
I mean, I'm glad
you're feeling better,

04:41.803 --> 04:44.705
but, boy, that sick
voice of yours was hot.

04:46.074 --> 04:47.374
Damn it,
this sucks, Brian.

04:47.409 --> 04:48.909
I was getting laid
left and right.

04:48.944 --> 04:51.161
Yeah, sounds like being sick
was really working for you.

04:51.196 --> 04:52.947
Well, you know
what I got to do?

04:52.981 --> 04:55.716
I got to make myself sick again
and get that voice back.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.484
Peter, that might
be the worst idea

04:57.519 --> 04:59.003
anyone has ever had.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.271
Well, you're wrong there.

05:00.305 --> 05:02.906
The worst idea anyone ever had
was silver bullets.

05:02.941 --> 05:06.143
Barbara Liebowitz's husband just
bought her a diamond brooch.

05:06.177 --> 05:08.095
You know how he
afforded that?

05:08.129 --> 05:09.430
He uses regular bullets.

05:09.464 --> 05:11.599
He uses regular bullets.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.971
Meg, have you seen Dad?

05:17.005 --> 05:18.405
Yeah, he's at the dentist.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.873
He's trying to get sick.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.595
Okay, go ahead
and spit.

05:24.629 --> 05:26.747
It's okay, go ahead.

05:28.617 --> 05:29.883
All right, Chris,

05:29.901 --> 05:31.685
I figured out a great
way to get sick.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.139
I'm gonna be a woman at work
who cannot get sick right now.

05:36.508 --> 05:38.158
Sweetie, maybe you
need to go home.

05:38.193 --> 05:39.276
I'm not going home.

05:39.327 --> 05:40.727
I cannot get sick right now.

05:40.745 --> 05:42.196
I have way too much to do.

05:42.230 --> 05:44.031
It's okay, everyone
will understand.

05:44.065 --> 05:46.216
No. I cannot get sick
right now.

05:46.251 --> 05:48.118
There's Kendra's birthday
and the baby shower,

05:48.153 --> 05:50.487
and with this move, I-I just
cannot get sick right now.

05:50.522 --> 05:51.905
I have to finish typing this...

05:51.923 --> 05:53.240
typing this...

05:54.526 --> 05:56.927
That's it; I'm
taking you home.

05:58.129 --> 05:59.713
You did this to me!

06:01.516 --> 06:02.716
Miss Lohan!
Lindsay!

06:02.750 --> 06:04.968
Over here, Lindsay!

06:05.020 --> 06:07.588
Excuse me, which one was
Lindsay Lohan's dessert fork?

06:07.622 --> 06:09.623
I think it
was that one.

06:11.726 --> 06:14.328
Give me cocaine!

06:17.766 --> 06:19.500
The History Channel presents

06:19.534 --> 06:22.036
<i>Where in World War Two</i>
<i>is Waldo?</i>

06:26.474 --> 06:28.542
Do I sound sexy?

06:28.576 --> 06:30.644
Tell me I sound sexy.

06:30.679 --> 06:32.246
Peter, what the hell?
You look terrible.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.697
Clear off the couch, kids.

06:33.732 --> 06:35.766
I'm gonna do your mother
right here.

06:37.469 --> 06:38.936
Oh, my God, Peter!

06:38.970 --> 06:40.537
Oh, I'm leaving.

06:40.572 --> 06:42.389
I cannot get
sick right now.

06:48.613 --> 06:51.382
Dr. Hartman,
is Peter gonna be okay?

06:51.383 --> 06:53.884
If one more person
asks me about a patient today,

06:53.919 --> 06:55.920
I'm gonna scream.

06:57.439 --> 06:58.656
What time is it?

06:58.690 --> 07:00.007
Peter, what are you doing?

07:00.041 --> 07:01.308
Get back in bed.

07:01.343 --> 07:02.510
I can't, Lois.

07:02.544 --> 07:04.211
I got the bowling
tournament this afternoon.

07:04.246 --> 07:06.046
Quagmire and Joe
are counting on me.

07:06.081 --> 07:07.615
Forget about bowling, Peter.

07:07.649 --> 07:09.049
You're very sick.

07:09.084 --> 07:10.451
You're not going anywhere.

07:10.485 --> 07:12.553
But if I don't go,
we'll have to forfeit.

07:12.587 --> 07:15.489
I'm sorry, but you need
to stay here and get better.

07:15.524 --> 07:17.892
Well, then, you're gonna
have to bowl for me.

07:17.926 --> 07:19.343
What?

07:19.377 --> 07:21.145
Peter, I haven't bowled
since college.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.997
Please, you got to do
me this favor, Lois.

07:23.031 --> 07:25.900
You owe me from when I took you
to see Shakespeare in the Park,

07:25.934 --> 07:27.701
even though it was
the part of the park

07:27.736 --> 07:29.236
where the gay guys
go to have sex.

07:29.271 --> 07:31.405
To be, or not to be...

07:31.439 --> 07:32.873
Aah!

07:32.908 --> 07:34.241
Aah! Right there!

07:34.276 --> 07:36.243
Ignore that;
that's not part of the play.

07:36.278 --> 07:38.145
That is the question.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.513
Whether 'tis nobler...

07:39.548 --> 07:41.215
This isn't
love, by the way.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.821
Brian, get your keys.

07:46.872 --> 07:48.589
I need you to drive me
to that toy factory

07:48.623 --> 07:49.890
so I can get Rupert back.

07:49.925 --> 07:52.026
Stewie, Lois sent him back
'cause he's not safe.

07:52.060 --> 07:53.594
But, Brian, I miss him!

07:53.628 --> 07:55.296
Without Rupert, I...

07:55.330 --> 07:57.598
Are you watching
porn in the kitchen?

07:57.632 --> 07:59.383
Come on, man,
we eat in here.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.535
Anyway, I need you to
drive me to Middleborough.

08:01.570 --> 08:03.337
Middleborough? That's, like,
two hours from here.

08:03.371 --> 08:05.105
I'm not doing that.
Come on, Brian.

08:05.140 --> 08:06.790
Tell you what, you drive
me to Middleborough,

08:06.825 --> 08:09.460
and I'll teach you my secret
to picking up chicks.

08:09.494 --> 08:11.128
Hey.

08:11.163 --> 08:12.997
You-me, ba-boom, huh?

08:16.968 --> 08:18.769
Thanks for filling
in for Peter, Lois.

08:18.803 --> 08:20.654
Yeah, okay, but I hope
you brought it today,

08:20.689 --> 08:22.050
'cause this ain't
no ladies' lunch.

08:22.057 --> 08:23.791
Well, I'll certainly do
the best I can.

08:23.825 --> 08:25.125
But don't worry, Glenn,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.561
I'm one woman who knows
a thing or two about sports.

08:27.596 --> 08:28.996
Yeah, I know you think you are.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.498
Your softball chatter
made that quite clear.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.833
Okay, that's two down, guys,
two outs.

08:33.869 --> 08:35.419
Two out of the three outs
required.

08:35.453 --> 08:36.787
Okay, guys, let's go.

08:36.821 --> 08:38.272
Tom Brady is a quarterback.

08:38.306 --> 08:39.890
Okay, heads up, two down.

08:39.924 --> 08:41.625
College football is on Saturday.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.110
Okay, come on, look alive.

08:43.144 --> 08:45.796
NBA players
are predominantly black.

08:45.830 --> 08:47.548
Oh, hi, Lois.

08:47.582 --> 08:48.816
What are you doing here?

08:48.850 --> 08:50.017
I'm filling in
for Peter.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.118
He's sick.

08:51.152 --> 08:53.153
All right,
finally a little harpoon

08:53.188 --> 08:55.022
in the bowling alley.

08:55.056 --> 08:58.242
All right, what do you say
we get this thing started, huh?

09:02.197 --> 09:03.898
Nice roll, Lois!

09:03.932 --> 09:05.566
My God.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.168
If she chews gum,
she's got the whole package.

09:08.203 --> 09:09.753
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!

09:09.788 --> 09:11.155
Take that, you jagoffs!

09:11.189 --> 09:12.389
I hope you die!

09:12.423 --> 09:14.758
God, Quagmire gets so
competitive with sports.

09:14.793 --> 09:16.427
Hey, Quagmire,
it's just a game.

09:16.461 --> 09:17.561
Ta it kesy.

09:17.596 --> 09:18.629
I'm not gonna take it easy!

09:18.663 --> 09:19.830
These guys are going down!

09:19.864 --> 09:22.216
You're going down
in front of all these people!

09:30.575 --> 09:32.776
All right, Lois,
it's all up to you.

09:32.811 --> 09:35.279
We only need six to
beat the Pinheads.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.647
And it would be four

09:36.681 --> 09:39.183
if someone could've hit
that seven-ten split, right?

09:39.217 --> 09:40.200
Joe!

09:40.235 --> 09:42.052
Joe, Joey, Joey,
Joey, Joe, Joey, Joe!

09:44.000 --> 09:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:58.853 --> 10:00.154
Yes!
Yeah!

10:00.188 --> 10:01.922
Yeah! We did it!

10:03.091 --> 10:04.758
Oh, what's this?
What's this?

10:04.793 --> 10:06.110
It says right here we won!

10:06.144 --> 10:08.012
We won, you dicks!
You suck!

10:08.046 --> 10:10.347
Um, excuse me,
would you mind keeping it down?

10:10.382 --> 10:12.583
We're having my son's
birthday party over here.

10:12.617 --> 10:13.777
Yeah, sure, sure,
sure, honey.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.619
What's his name?
Mikey.

10:15.654 --> 10:18.038
Happy  birthday, Mikey!

10:18.089 --> 10:19.290
Yeah!

10:23.028 --> 10:24.528
Well, this is great.

10:24.562 --> 10:25.923
So when you guys
aren't celebrating

10:25.930 --> 10:28.198
a big bowling victory,
what do you normally do here?

10:28.233 --> 10:30.634
Uh, well,
sometimes we compare women.

10:30.669 --> 10:32.619
Talk about who we'd rather
have sex with.

10:32.654 --> 10:33.854
Oh, that sounds fun.

10:33.888 --> 10:35.189
How do you play?

10:35.223 --> 10:36.323
Well, it's like, um--

10:36.358 --> 10:37.725
Okay, who would you rather do,

10:37.759 --> 10:39.560
Kristen Stewart
or Scarlett Johansson?

10:39.594 --> 10:41.695
Oh, definitely
Scarlett Johansson.

10:41.730 --> 10:43.163
For one thing,
there's the boobs,

10:43.198 --> 10:45.399
which Kristen Stewart
does not have.

10:45.433 --> 10:47.368
Also, I get the sense
that Kristen Stewart

10:47.402 --> 10:50.037
is more of a bath person
when she really needs a shower.

10:50.071 --> 10:51.638
She does seem
kind of dirty.

10:51.673 --> 10:53.841
Yeah, someone should write
"wash me"

10:53.875 --> 10:55.509
in the dust
on that flat ass.

10:55.543 --> 10:56.844
Ha!
Ho-ho!

10:56.878 --> 10:58.512
Move over funnyman
Richard Lewis.

10:58.546 --> 11:00.581
We got Richard Lois!

11:05.570 --> 11:06.603
Well, here we are.

11:06.638 --> 11:09.173
great.
Hey, may on the ride home,

11:09.207 --> 11:10.774
someone else can tell
a story.

11:12.977 --> 11:14.845
So what exactly is
your plan here?

11:14.879 --> 11:16.347
I've got it all
figured out, Brian.

11:16.381 --> 11:18.849
This tour will take us
deep into the factory,

11:18.883 --> 11:21.635
and when the time is right,
we'll slip away and find Rupert.

11:21.669 --> 11:24.138
Does anyone have
any questions so far?

11:24.172 --> 11:25.522
Who's that up there?

11:25.556 --> 11:26.857
Oh, that's our gunman.

11:26.891 --> 11:29.393
Every once in a while,
one of our toys becomes real,

11:29.427 --> 11:31.595
and we have to make sure
it doesn't get out.

11:39.721 --> 11:43.040
Brian, look!
That must be where Rupert is!

11:45.727 --> 11:48.028
Rupert!
My God, you're all right!

11:48.063 --> 11:49.530
Oh, you missed so much!

11:49.564 --> 11:51.899
I had to deliver a speech
to Britain,

11:51.933 --> 11:54.518
and I overcame my stutter
through some pretty kooky means.

11:54.552 --> 11:55.953
Brian, don't say
anything.

11:55.987 --> 11:57.521
Uh, Stewie?

11:59.140 --> 12:00.741
Oh, crap.

12:00.775 --> 12:04.461
This is not the way out!
This is not the way out!

12:07.832 --> 12:10.200
Hey, Horace, get that
wiener out of your hand

12:10.235 --> 12:12.236
and give us three more beers
over here!

12:12.270 --> 12:14.938
Lois, you're always
giving me the business.

12:16.825 --> 12:19.009
Hey, I meant
to tell you guys.

12:19.043 --> 12:20.844
We shot some drug dealer
this morning,

12:20.879 --> 12:23.414
and he had three Red Sox
tickets in his pocket.

12:23.448 --> 12:24.415
That's awesome!

12:24.449 --> 12:26.350
Oh, this'll be so fun!

12:26.384 --> 12:28.068
You know, if we leave
right now,

12:28.103 --> 12:30.654
we can probably still get there
before the first pitch.

12:30.688 --> 12:31.789
Hey, you guys.

12:31.823 --> 12:33.557
Oh, hey, Peter.
How's it going?

12:33.591 --> 12:35.726
Peter, it's so good
to see you up and around!

12:35.760 --> 12:37.394
Yeah, how ya feeling?

12:37.429 --> 12:38.612
I'm feeling shipshape.

12:38.646 --> 12:40.547
If the ship is
the S.S. <i>Minnow!</i>

12:40.582 --> 12:42.316
Doctor said I'd be
making bland jokes

12:42.350 --> 12:44.685
for about a week,
then I'd be good as new.

12:44.719 --> 12:45.886
Ah, that's good to hear.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.355
Well, we were just on
our way up to Fenway.

12:48.389 --> 12:49.723
Aw, you got tickets?
That's sweet.

12:49.757 --> 12:51.191
You know, there's
no better outing

12:51.226 --> 12:53.360
than watching
nine innings.

12:54.462 --> 12:56.029
Sorry, I'll perk up
at the game.

12:56.064 --> 12:58.599
Oh, well, actually,
we only have three tickets,

12:58.633 --> 13:00.000
and we're going with Lois.

13:00.034 --> 13:01.335
With Lois?

13:01.369 --> 13:02.636
Oh, yeah, we've actually been

13:02.670 --> 13:04.004
having a great time with her.

13:04.038 --> 13:05.506
And she's quite
a bowler, too.

13:05.540 --> 13:06.707
Is that all right,
Peter?

13:06.741 --> 13:09.510
Do you mind if I go
to the game with the guys?

13:09.544 --> 13:10.644
Yeah, no, that's,
that's fine.

13:10.678 --> 13:12.679
I mean, yeah, you only
got three tickets.

13:12.714 --> 13:14.214
I mean, that's cool.
Have fun.

13:14.249 --> 13:15.949
Okay, we'll see you later.

13:17.785 --> 13:19.353
Hey, Horace,

13:19.387 --> 13:21.472
why don't you take that
wiener out of your hand

13:21.506 --> 13:22.639
and get me a beer.

13:22.674 --> 13:25.125
Don't talk to me that way,
you son of a bitch!

13:32.851 --> 13:33.818
Oh, hey, Peter!

13:33.852 --> 13:34.852
Oh, hey.

13:34.886 --> 13:36.520
Did you have fun
at the game?

13:36.555 --> 13:38.055
Oh, yeah,
it was so exciting.

13:38.089 --> 13:40.391
They scored the winning hit
right at the buzzer.

13:40.425 --> 13:41.659
I'm sorry you missed it.

13:41.693 --> 13:43.194
Yeah, no,
th-that's okay.

13:43.228 --> 13:46.030
I've just been hanging out here
having a great time with...

13:46.064 --> 13:47.298
Meg?!
Hey.

13:47.332 --> 13:49.733
I thought you was a bag
of peeling potatoes.

13:49.768 --> 13:51.235
Well, maybe next time
you can come

13:51.269 --> 13:53.270
with us when we go
to Red Sock Field.

13:53.305 --> 13:54.872
Nobody calls it that.

13:54.906 --> 13:58.075
Quags and Swanny were so funny
yelling things at the visitors.

13:58.109 --> 13:59.176
Quags and Swanny?!

13:59.211 --> 14:00.978
Lois, it's one thing
to steal my friends,

14:01.012 --> 14:02.997
but don't go giving them
stupid new nicknames.

14:03.031 --> 14:04.315
What are you
talking about?

14:04.349 --> 14:05.916
I didn't steal
your friends, Peter.

14:05.951 --> 14:08.219
I'm only doing
what you asked me to do.

14:08.253 --> 14:10.321
No, I asked you
to take my place

14:10.355 --> 14:12.223
at the bowling
tournament, that's it!

14:12.257 --> 14:13.657
Look, Lois, I have
my friends,

14:13.692 --> 14:14.925
and you have groceries

14:14.960 --> 14:16.927
and all those rusty
pink razors in the shower.

14:16.962 --> 14:18.896
Now just stick to what's
intended for you

14:18.930 --> 14:20.231
and leave my
things to me.

14:20.265 --> 14:21.699
Are you saying
you want me

14:21.733 --> 14:23.701
to stop hanging out
with Joe and Quagmire?

14:23.735 --> 14:25.436
They're <i>my</i> friends.
They're all I got!

14:25.470 --> 14:27.204
And you know
how hard it is

14:27.239 --> 14:28.706
for me to make
new friends.

14:34.429 --> 14:36.847
Is this friends?

14:41.703 --> 14:43.137
Stewie, we're never
gonna find him.

14:43.171 --> 14:44.638
They're all
exactly the same.

14:44.673 --> 14:48.008
Wow. I wish you could hear how
racist you sound right now.

14:48.043 --> 14:49.310
Come on. Can't you give

14:49.344 --> 14:50.978
that giraffe at home
another chance?

14:51.012 --> 14:52.680
You know, for every one
they sell,

14:52.714 --> 14:54.448
they save a giraffe
in the wild.

14:56.501 --> 15:00.304
Sorry, giraffes!
They only bought one!

15:00.338 --> 15:02.790
Nah, they returned it!

15:06.611 --> 15:08.445
And so Lois sweet-talks
her way backstage.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.813
Next thing you know,

15:09.848 --> 15:11.715
we're partying all night
with the trapeze people!

15:11.750 --> 15:13.551
One of them drives a Volvo!

15:13.585 --> 15:16.120
Drives a super-safe car,
does <i>that</i> for a living!

15:16.154 --> 15:17.154
Go figure!

15:19.040 --> 15:21.392
So what? She can name
a kind of car.

15:21.426 --> 15:23.227
Big whoop.
I can do that, too.

15:23.261 --> 15:24.328
Vikki.

15:24.362 --> 15:25.596
Vikki Carr.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.264
Peter, relax.
It just happens

15:27.299 --> 15:29.466
that your wife has some
funny stories, that's all.

15:29.501 --> 15:31.869
Well, I got some
funny stories.

15:31.903 --> 15:34.138
I knew a guy
who choked on an almond.

15:34.172 --> 15:35.472
And he had a stroke.

15:35.507 --> 15:37.808
Now he can't take care
of his own bathroom needs.

15:39.277 --> 15:40.928
That's not funny.
That sounds sad.

15:40.962 --> 15:42.463
Yeah, I feel
bad for him.

15:42.497 --> 15:43.931
Oh, don't feel bad
for him.

15:43.965 --> 15:45.532
He got his name
in the paper.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.818
What?

15:47.852 --> 15:49.453
Please look at me!

15:49.487 --> 15:51.088
What the hell's wrong
with you, Peter?

15:51.122 --> 15:53.002
Nothing. What the hell's
wrong with you, Swanny?

15:53.024 --> 15:54.325
I'm Quags.

15:54.359 --> 15:57.261
I don't know
who any of you are anymore!

15:57.295 --> 15:58.963
Oh, he's really upset.

15:58.997 --> 16:00.631
I haven't seen him like this

16:00.665 --> 16:02.666
since he saw
that Rocky Dennis movie.

16:02.701 --> 16:06.253
Take off the mask!
That's your problem!

16:06.288 --> 16:07.488
Right?

16:11.660 --> 16:14.044
That's it, Brian.
He's not here.

16:14.079 --> 16:15.946
None of these
bears are Rupert.

16:15.981 --> 16:17.281
Stewie...

16:17.315 --> 16:20.217
You don't have
to say it, Brian. I know.

16:21.503 --> 16:24.672
So this is what it feels
like to be a grown-up, huh?

16:24.706 --> 16:26.740
All alone in the world.

16:26.775 --> 16:29.944
Look, Stewie,
nothing lasts forever.

16:29.978 --> 16:32.346
You and Rupert had
some special times together,

16:32.380 --> 16:33.881
and you'll always have that.

16:35.116 --> 16:36.583
What the deuce?
What's that noise?

16:36.618 --> 16:37.618
I don't know.

16:47.345 --> 16:49.663
Oh, my God!
Brian, look!

16:52.934 --> 16:54.084
That's him!
That's Rupert!

16:54.119 --> 16:55.552
How do you know?

16:55.587 --> 16:57.187
You can't hear
him calling me?

16:57.222 --> 16:58.656
He's calling me,
clear as day!

16:58.690 --> 17:00.457
Ah. Yeah,
now I hear him.

17:00.492 --> 17:02.860
Rupert, yes, we're here
to rescue you!

17:02.894 --> 17:04.211
Stewie, wait!
It's too dangerous!

17:04.244 --> 17:06.413
I won't let it end
like this, Brian!

17:21.262 --> 17:23.213
Don't you give up on me, Rupert!

17:23.263 --> 17:24.932
Hang on, Stewie!
Maybe I can help!

17:24.965 --> 17:26.333
Maybe I can use this helicopter

17:26.351 --> 17:28.051
to knock Rupert off
the conveyor belt...

17:28.103 --> 17:29.503
Ah! Son of a bitch!

17:29.537 --> 17:31.221
Recall room, Brian.
Nothing works in here.

17:31.272 --> 17:32.890
Now come on!
Rupert's in trouble!

17:32.941 --> 17:34.892
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.

17:42.567 --> 17:44.785
Almost there.
You can do this, Stewie.

18:02.870 --> 18:05.089
♪

18:25.510 --> 18:26.243
Damn it!

18:26.277 --> 18:29.246
Brian, do something!

18:48.249 --> 18:51.468
Oh, Rupert!
Thank God, you're alive!

18:51.519 --> 18:53.687
I'm... I'm ready now.

18:53.721 --> 18:55.689
I'm ready to get off the pill.

18:55.723 --> 18:58.758
I think we should start trying.

19:02.347 --> 19:04.248
Look, Peter, I think
there's something

19:04.282 --> 19:05.816
we should talk about.

19:05.850 --> 19:08.218
I'm not reading the last page
of that dinosaur book.

19:08.253 --> 19:10.087
I know something bad
happens to 'em.

19:10.121 --> 19:11.688
No, Peter, we need
to talk about

19:11.723 --> 19:13.090
this situation
with the guys.

19:13.124 --> 19:16.610
Look, of course I like hanging
out with Joe and Quagmire.

19:16.628 --> 19:19.446
But I like hanging out
with you more.

19:19.464 --> 19:22.749
I mean, it's nice to make
new friends, but not if it means

19:22.783 --> 19:25.085
losing the best friend
I've ever had.

19:25.119 --> 19:27.404
Yeah, well, I was
probably kind of a jerk, too.

19:27.438 --> 19:29.640
I guess I shouldn't be
telling you who you can

19:29.674 --> 19:31.141
and can't be
friends with.

19:33.077 --> 19:34.311
Hey, you guys want to go

19:34.345 --> 19:36.163
with me and Joe
to the roller derby?

19:36.197 --> 19:38.132
It's great. You get
to see big, husky chicks

19:38.166 --> 19:39.883
elbow each other
right in the jugs.

19:39.918 --> 19:41.185
Oh, that sounds like fun.

19:41.219 --> 19:42.452
Yeah, and I'm bringing
my grill

19:42.487 --> 19:45.239
so we can eat corn in the
parking lot before we go in.

19:45.273 --> 19:46.456
What do you say?
Who's in?

19:46.491 --> 19:47.457
Sounds great!

19:47.492 --> 19:49.376
Yeah, that'll be really...

19:52.247 --> 19:53.580
You know what, you guys?

19:53.615 --> 19:55.949
I think I'm gonna
just stay in tonight.

19:55.984 --> 19:58.585
I got a huge stack
of coupons to go through.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.787
Plus, I'm planning on having
my period really hard later,

20:00.822 --> 20:03.490
and I want to be
in the tub when it happens.

20:03.525 --> 20:05.359
You what?!
Gross.

20:05.393 --> 20:06.710
Oh, I get it.

20:06.744 --> 20:08.579
Guys, I think Lois
is getting a visit

20:08.613 --> 20:09.847
from her Aunt Period.

20:09.881 --> 20:11.582
Yeah, and lots
of other chick stuff

20:11.616 --> 20:13.800
you guys wouldn't be
interested in.

20:13.834 --> 20:17.287
Peter, go have fun
with your friends.

20:17.322 --> 20:19.356
Thanks, Lois.

20:22.727 --> 20:25.729
Oh, hey, Brian.
Where have you been?

20:25.763 --> 20:27.464
Oh, just reuniting
some old friends.

20:27.498 --> 20:28.782
Huh. Me, too.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.517
Feels good, doesn't it?

20:30.552 --> 20:32.219
Sure does.

20:33.588 --> 20:34.922
I love you, Rupert.

20:34.956 --> 20:36.924
Don't you ever leave me again.
