00:00.920 --> 00:02.285
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.960 --> 00:05.167
There are patterns on this cloth.
I've seen them before.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.280
I can see it. NICK: Can you
draw what you're seeing?

00:07.360 --> 00:08.725
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.136
You chose the wrong side, Sean.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.889
No, you're dead.
Does that really matter?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.041
Get the hell out of here.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.696
I'm not gonna make it
that easy for you.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.688
You have a baby in you.
More than one.

00:18.760 --> 00:19.886
What? Oh, God!

01:31.240 --> 01:33.527
Ugh, we're going
through this again.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.361
No, this isn't good for
either of us. Helen...

03:37.440 --> 03:40.284
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
It's okay. I just...

03:41.440 --> 03:45.161
I don't know. I thought
I heard something.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.725
It's probably nothing.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.000
Must be strange being back here
after everything that happened.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.480
Well, it's a lot better than when I
came back and found you and Kelly gone.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.206
You know I never would've...
I know.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.850
Let's go back to bed.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.005
I'm trying to tell you,
you made the right choice.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.846
No, I'm sorry. I can't do that.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.962
Helen, there's a weird guy.
Let me call you back.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.769
Are you okay?

04:18.920 --> 04:20.809
Hungry.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.690
Need something to eat.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.008
Look, I don't have any food.

04:27.200 --> 04:33.287
Uh, I'm gonna call 911 for you
'cause you look really bad.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.531
911. What's your emergency?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.847
Hi. Look, I'm in
Stillman Park right now,

04:40.920 --> 04:43.321
and there's this guy on the
ground, and he's filthy.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.530
Um, I have no idea who he is, but
you need to send somebody here

04:47.720 --> 04:49.848
because I think he's, like,
starving to death.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.088
Are you near him?
Yes, I'm right by him.

04:53.200 --> 04:59.207
Yeah, yeah. He's not here. I'm sorry.
I'm not sure what happened.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.210
You gonna follow me everywhere?

06:38.400 --> 06:41.165
I like your new place, Sean,
but I'm not following you.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.003
I'm haunting you.
There is a difference.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.491
Well, it's annoying
in either case.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.680
You know, it's been a long
time since I've seen her.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.000
Seen who? Diana.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.600
I was there when she was born.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.330
It was quite an experience.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.528
I'm not really used to
bringing life into the world.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.846
Is that what this is about?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.536
You want some thanks for being
there when I couldn't be?

06:58.560 --> 07:00.560
Well, thank you, really.
Thank you for being there.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.776
I really appreciate everything

07:01.800 --> 07:03.689
that you've done
for Diana and me.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.844
It's too bad
you didn't think of that

07:05.920 --> 07:07.922
before, you know,
that betrayal thing.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.496
Is this gonna be
a regular treat with you?

07:10.520 --> 07:13.285
You gonna keep showing up here
and making me feel sorry?

07:13.360 --> 07:14.850
Because I don't do
sorry very well.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.456
Do I look shocked? Look, we
had some good times together,

07:17.480 --> 07:20.768
and I really appreciate everything
that you've done for all of us.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.610
For Diana, for Adalind, and me.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.330
Did I leave anybody out?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.136
Because I would really
like to be clone with this

07:26.160 --> 07:27.321
once and for all.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.563
I'm not sure I can commit to
a half-assed haunting, Sean.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.131
I mean, you wouldn't respect me

07:32.200 --> 07:33.456
if I were to take
a cheap thank you

07:33.480 --> 07:35.960
and drifted off into
whatever awaits me.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.216
I think we have some real
issues to work through.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.446
I'm tired.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.324
I just wanna get
some sleep. I'd love it

07:41.400 --> 07:43.482
if you got the hell
out of my room!

07:43.600 --> 07:44.840
Well, there's the problem.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.527
Am I in your room, or
am I just in your mind?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.402
Now that's awesome.
Am I even here?

07:51.280 --> 07:54.568
Okay. Fine.
You take the bedroom.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.441
Now we're getting somewhere.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.561
I've heard the only way to battle your
demons is to take a trip to their hell-

08:54.120 --> 08:55.929
We have one strong
heartbeat, that's for sure.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.451
How does it look? It's healthy?

08:57.680 --> 09:00.251
Yes, exactly as it should at
this point of the pregnancy.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.007
Just the one? One's not enough?

09:05.440 --> 09:08.569
No, no. One's great. It's just,
we thought...

09:08.640 --> 09:10.369
We thought maybe there was more.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.044
Yeah.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.605
What's wrong? I think...

09:19.240 --> 09:21.322
Well, there is
a second heartbeat.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.161
Really?

09:23.240 --> 09:24.976
Yeah, I guess you know
your body pretty well.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.764
Congratulations.
You're gonna have...

09:26.840 --> 09:29.411
Twins. It's just twins.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.281
Well, maybe not.
Well, this is a surprise.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.168
There is a third heartbeat.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.921
Three?

09:42.080 --> 09:43.161
Mmm-hmm.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.401
I love you, and we can do this.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.480
I'm pretty sure I was dead.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.086
Well, you were there. You should know.
I was shot.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.496
Look, I know you
think you were shot,

09:55.520 --> 09:56.800
but maybe it was something else.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.565
I felt the bullets, Hank.
I went down.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.441
I knew I was dying.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.521
I could feel it.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.209
And then I wasn't.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.085
I mean, you saw
what happened with Eve.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.168
I can't explain anything
that's been going on.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.568
I keep thinking I need
to be carrying that stick.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.406
Are you? No.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.361
But it's like...

10:17.520 --> 10:20.126
It's like you get used
to carrying your weapon,

10:20.200 --> 10:22.936
and when you don't have it, you feel
like you're missing a piece of yourself.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.689
I know, but we have
a license for that.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.096
I try to stop thinking about it,

10:26.120 --> 10:27.400
but it's not
working out so well.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.611
Where is it?

10:31.480 --> 10:32.606
I put it back in the tunnel.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.376
Don't you think you should put it
someplace a little further out?

10:35.400 --> 10:36.816
No, I wanna understand
what happened.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.126
I wanna know where it came from.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.521
I wanna know why the men
who found it buried it,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.489
and I wanna know what's
written on that cloth

10:43.560 --> 10:44.561
that's wrapped around it.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.722
Sometimes, we can want too much.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.323
And what if we found out
and wished we hadn't?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.161
Maybe that's why it's buried.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.896
Then why didn't
they just destroy it?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.320
Maybe they tried,
and they couldn't.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.256
We are dealing with stuff that
may not have an explanation

10:57.280 --> 10:58.406
we can understand.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.080
It's Wu.

11:05.560 --> 11:06.925
Where are we supposed to be?

11:08.560 --> 11:11.166
Stillman Square Park.
We're 15 away.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.446
I do not like dead bodies
on an empty stomach.

11:19.560 --> 11:22.564
Okay, I'm ready.
Is Daddy coming down?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.283
I don't know.
He's in the bedroom.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.682
I think he was having
bad dreams last night.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.241
Oh.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.608
- Hmm. That's too bad.
- Hey.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.127
- How long you been here?
- About 15 minutes.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.884
Oh, I'm sorry. I overslept.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.285
Did everything
go okay last night?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.287
Oh, yeah. No, we had a great
time, didn't we? Uh-huh.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.451
Okay. Well, I'll call you later.
Okay.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.643
I like the new place. Me, too.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.730
Hey, Adalind. Yeah?

11:59.600 --> 12:02.331
Have you ever dealt with, uh...

12:03.560 --> 12:04.641
What?

12:07.640 --> 12:10.086
Never mind. Call me later.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.361
Okay-

12:24.840 --> 12:26.649
So I'm guessing no ID.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.931
I think what you see
is what you get.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.524
We did a search for clothes, but
besides a kid's dirty t-shirt,

12:33.600 --> 12:35.204
a pile of rags,
and a catcher's mitt,

12:35.280 --> 12:38.363
which I suppose could have covered
his essentials, this is it.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.160
We also didn't find a wallet
or keys or a cell phone.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.091
Who found him? Jogger
found him around 6:45.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.770
Thought he was asleep
on the first lap.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.923
At mile three, he stopped for a
closer look and had a mild freak-out

12:49.000 --> 12:51.162
when he realized
this guy was done.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.608
Where is this pile of rags?
Over here.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.207
Stuffed under some bushes, but I think
they've been here for quite a while.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.801
Smell good, too.
Want me to get them out?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.401
No, leave it
for CSU just in case.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.886
And run the Vic's prints.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.364
Check to see if there are any
reports of a naked man in a park

13:11.480 --> 13:12.561
sometime last night.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.167
Uh, this is Portland. I might
have to narrow that down.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.490
So he either came to
the park fully clothed

13:21.560 --> 13:23.767
and was robbed of
everything he had,

13:23.840 --> 13:25.569
or he came to the park
with no clothes

13:25.640 --> 13:27.802
and was killed for
no personal gain.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.566
Might have just been some sadistic
sexual encounter gone bad.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.083
Really? No. It's Wesen.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.484
He may not have a future, but
he's got just enough of a past.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.127
Jeremy Tauberg.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.727
Arrested for disorderly conduct last
year and a DUI three years ago.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.645
Local address in the Southwest.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.360
Let's take it from that address.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.205
Help! Help! Please help me!

13:58.480 --> 14:00.448
He fell in! I can't get him out!

14:00.520 --> 14:01.931
He was just playing in the dirt.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.329
His foot's stuck on something.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.085
- It's got to be a root.
- Oh, my God.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.361
Help!

14:21.080 --> 14:22.764
Definitely been
down there a while.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.440
With that many roots, I'd say
at least a couple years.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.604
Evidence of clothing
pretty rotted.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.680
I'll know more when I get
the postmortem interval.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.856
Pieces of that clothing on
the corpse look a lot like

14:32.880 --> 14:34.166
the ones stuffed in the bushes.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.890
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.885
So a body gets
buried underground.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.291
It starts to rot.
It gets smaller,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.200
leaving a hole where
the body was, right?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.044
Yeah. Kid starts playing.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.566
Ground collapses.
Kid falls in the hole.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.007
I'm following.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.976
Doesn't this hole seem
a little big for one body?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.490
Well, could be a big body.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.210
Yeah, but the mother said the
kid was playing in the dirt.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.082
I don't see any dirt in
this park. It's all grass.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.084
All right, so if
everything is grass,

15:00.320 --> 15:03.130
how did the dirt get dug up
before the kid fell in?

15:03.680 --> 15:05.967
Somebody did some digging
before the kid started playing.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.767
But why would somebody start digging
right where the body was buried

15:09.840 --> 15:11.808
unless they knew the body
was buried right here?

15:11.960 --> 15:13.440
So it's either
a complete coincidence,

15:13.480 --> 15:14.845
or the killer was the digger.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.561
Hey, we believe in a lot of
things, but not coincidence.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.842
You see any signs of
a pick or a shovel?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.963
I do not.

15:22.040 --> 15:27.968
But I do see some dirt from the hole scattered
in the direction of our other body.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.960
There was more than
one body in that hole.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.291
And one of the bodies got out.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.725
Wearing some nasty ass clothes.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.168
Which is why Mr. Tauberg is lying
naked and dead in the park.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.004
So glad this world makes sense.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.126
More coffee?
Yeah. And more steak.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.607
Seriously?
And this time make it rare.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.731
When was the last time you ate?

16:01.880 --> 16:04.486
Been a while. That's the thing.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.401
You can never tell.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.451
They always look bigger
than they are.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.486
But this last one,

16:12.600 --> 16:15.000
she didn't last anywhere near
as long as I thought she would.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.406
She was pretty. That's why.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.447
I was distracted by her face.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.686
Won't make that mistake again.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.401
Oh!

16:25.920 --> 16:27.840
And why don't you bring me
a couple Bloody Marys?

16:28.240 --> 16:31.449
'Cause I feel like it is
gonna be a beautiful day.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.760
Steiger.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.361
It's Renard.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.521
Been a long time, Sean.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.963
Yeah, I know.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.166
Look, I need to see you.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.444
When? Tonight.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.289
<i>I can't wait-</i>

17:10.000 --> 17:12.048
Tauberg, wearing
a sport coat with no tie,

17:12.119 --> 17:14.805
had drinks at Flannigan's
with a few friends after work.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.611
Walked home about 11:00.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.723
Co-worker said he always
walked through the park

17:18.800 --> 17:19.935
'cause he lived
on the other side.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.769
His address is on Sycamore,

17:21.839 --> 17:23.285
a few blocks on the other side.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.287
Sc was Tauberg a target because he was
convenient or because of his clothes?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.122
Tauberg was 6'1170.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.856
Well, that narrows
it down a little.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.136
Got a hit on
Tauberg's credit card.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.685
Used this morning
at Sunnyside Diner.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.205
It's about a mile from the park.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.040
You want to check it out,
or you want me to...

17:40.160 --> 17:41.161
Can you describe him?

17:41.720 --> 17:45.008
Uh, normal-looking, I guess.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.604
Brown hair. Maybe 6 foot tall.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.440
Not heavy.
Just, you know, regular.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.240
Except for what he said.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.560
That was not regular.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.286
Well, what did he say?

17:56.600 --> 17:58.329
I don't remember
his exact words,

17:58.400 --> 18:02.485
but something like whatever he ate
was bigger than he thought it was,

18:02.880 --> 18:06.601
but then he said that "she" wasn't
as big as he thought she was,

18:06.680 --> 18:10.162
and something about her having a pretty
face, and he was distracted by that.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.521
I don't know.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.400
I mean, the way it sounded was like
he'd just chowed down on some babe.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.931
It just weirded me out a little.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.496
Do you think you can give a description
to a police sketch artist?

18:19.520 --> 18:22.046
Sure. What'd he do anyway?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.047
He's a person of interest
in a murder investigation.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.330
Burkhardt. Yeah. We can
be there in 20 minutes.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.531
Uh, wait. Is the Vic female?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.126
Thank you.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.650
ME is ready. The Vic was female.

18:38.920 --> 18:39.967
Had a feeling.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.530
Victim was mid-30s.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.480
Despite skin covering
much of the corpse,

18:43.520 --> 18:45.568
there was very little
decompositional fluid.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.564
An un-embalmed adult
normally takes anywhere

18:47.640 --> 18:49.563
from eight to 12 years
to skeletonize.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.010
After seven, there should be far less
skin present than there is here.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.045
Any idea how long
she was buried?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.004
Well, longer than
five years, maybe more.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.080
We'll know more
when we get the bugs back.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.881
But some of her skin
was somehow preserved

19:01.960 --> 19:03.883
and hardened into a waxy shell.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.440
I took subcutaneous samples

19:05.520 --> 19:07.600
and found traces of an enzyme
I've never seen before.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.445
Similar to anything?

19:09.520 --> 19:12.000
Digestive. But that's not all.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.007
See this cut? That was made either
before she died or right after.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.480
And there wasn't a trace
of organ tissue left inside.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.806
Her organs were removed.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.656
Yeah. But there are no
cut marks on the bones,

19:21.680 --> 19:24.160
which you'd get if someone
was using a knife.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.880
However, there are marks on the
bones that are indicative of teeth.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.046
Notice the indentations pretty
much all over the place.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.896
Looks like someone gnawed on it.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.001
They're all like that.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.929
Every bone in her body.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.691
Mommy? What?

19:50.120 --> 19:51.884
Do you know Meisner?

19:52.680 --> 19:53.761
How do you know that name?

19:54.480 --> 19:56.767
Daddy said his name
a lot of times last night.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.085
Why? I don't know.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.763
Sometimes, he said it really
loud like he was mad at him.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.167
Do you know him?

20:04.240 --> 20:06.004
Meisner? Uh, yeah.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.289
Or I did know him.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.964
He died, honey. Oh. That's sad.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.846
What happened to him?

20:14.840 --> 20:18.606
He got into a very bad fight
with some very bad men.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.970
Was Daddy one of them?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.443
You ready for lunch?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.210
I know Meisner.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.366
Well, you met him
once a really long time ago,

20:35.440 --> 20:38.603
but you were so small, I don't
think you'd remember that.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.650
I do remember. He was in
a helicopter with me.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.328
Oh, right. That.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.526
What do you remember about him?

20:47.400 --> 20:51.007
He was nice. Yeah, he was nice.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.925
He wanted the King to fly.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.729
I am the King!

20:58.600 --> 21:00.125
I don't think he did.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.410
I wanna see Meisner again.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.688
Oh, well, that would
be a little difficult

21:10.000 --> 21:11.889
'cause, like I said, he died.
I know.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.691
But I'd like to see him anyway.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.282
Oh, and Eve is here.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.885
What? Where?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.248
In the wall.
She doesn't feel good.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.444
She was drawing, too.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.610
Honey, I'm going
to go down there.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.008
If Kelly makes any noises,
you just let me know, okay?

21:38.320 --> 21:39.446
Okay-

21:48.160 --> 21:50.128
Eve? Oh, my God, Eve!

21:50.880 --> 21:51.961
Can you hear me?

21:52.880 --> 21:55.724
Okay. What are you
doing down here?

21:56.280 --> 21:57.560
We've got to get you
out of here.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.489
You've got to get up.
You've got to stand up.

21:59.560 --> 22:03.281
All right. You're gonna
have to go first. Come on.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.927
Okay. I'm right behind you.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.291
You got it?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.161
Okay.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.489
Okay, okay, got you.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.008
Right over here. I got you.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.600
Will you get me
a glass of water?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.405
Okay, just lay back. Lay back.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.201
Okay-

22:35.720 --> 22:37.882
Is she gonna live in my bed now?

22:38.320 --> 22:39.924
No, sweetie, she's just resting.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.246
Is she gonna die?

22:42.320 --> 22:43.890
I hope not.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.329
But I think she's got a fever.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.488
I'm gonna go get her
a washcloth, okay?

23:04.160 --> 23:06.049
Diana?

23:06.560 --> 23:07.561
Diana?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.011
Oh, God.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.761
Diana?

23:21.840 --> 23:22.921
Diana?

23:23.440 --> 23:26.171
I really don't think
it's a good idea for you to be...

23:26.240 --> 23:27.571
Down here.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.764
Hey, I think I've got something.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.681
Hmm. Pretty close.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.883
Nick, that better
be you down there.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.327
Yeah, it's me and Hank.
We thought you would be here.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.811
We had a prenatal exam.

23:55.960 --> 24:01.126
Everything okay?
Okay, okay, and okay.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.528
What? Three? Apparently, yes.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.365
Well, congratulations! Thanks.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.050
Really happy for you guys.
Oh, boy.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.963
What are you guys looking for?

24:12.160 --> 24:13.241
This.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.243
Ataktos Fuse.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.210
Look at you reading Greek.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.336
I think there's
a translation here.

24:19.360 --> 24:20.521
In Latin.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.204
Ah, let's find out
what it means.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.840
So, what, does your victim look like that?
One of them.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.809
Uh-oh. More than one?

24:27.040 --> 24:29.416
Yeah, we think he's responsible
for two very different crimes.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.080
We just haven't been able
to connect them.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.847
Ataktos Fuse, or Bestia Festiva,

24:35.160 --> 24:37.481
loosely translated,
means "Party animal."

24:37.720 --> 24:38.960
Party animal? Really?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.960
- Yeah, that's what it says.
- Yeah, right here.

24:48.920 --> 24:54.450
Translates to, "Your party animal
was the inspiration for Dionysus."

24:54.840 --> 24:56.922
Good old Dionysus,
god of wine and orgies.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.041
Hmm.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.249
Wait. This can't be right. It says
the Ataktos Fuse is immortal.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.170
Well, that's obviously
a metaphor.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.968
No, it says it resurrects from the
earth for one day every seven years.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.081
Seven years?

25:08.200 --> 25:10.248
Sounds like he's in the
ballpark for another victim.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.562
And he only comes above
ground for 24 hours?

25:12.760 --> 25:13.807
According to this.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.416
If I was up for one day
every seven years,

25:15.440 --> 25:16.771
I'd be a party animal.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.605
Although in those 24 hours,
it needs to find a food source

25:19.720 --> 25:21.529
to take underground and feed on.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.567
And by food source, you mean...

25:25.160 --> 25:28.004
Somebody big enough
to sustain them underground.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.444
So this guy might be looking for
his next plus-sized stockpile.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.491
Wu just sent a facial composite
of the guy from the diner.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.282
So that's our Ataktos Fuse.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.283
Wait a minute.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.523
I've seen this face before.
I think I know this guy.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.456
How could you know him if he's only above
ground for one day every seven years?

25:49.480 --> 25:50.736
No, it was more
recent than that.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.936
Then it can't be the same guy.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.376
No, I'm telling you.
It's the same guy.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.289
I've seen this face somewhere.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.051
Will you send me this sketch?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.248
We have less than 24 hours
to figure that out

25:59.440 --> 26:00.920
because, if we don't
find him tonight,

26:00.960 --> 26:02.485
he's gone another seven years.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.776
Hey, Adalind. Everything okay?

26:05.800 --> 26:08.280
Eve's here. She's been
living in the tunnels.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.563
What? She's in pretty bad shape.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.723
I didn't know she was here.
Diana sensed her.

26:12.840 --> 26:13.841
Can you come home?

26:13.880 --> 26:15.848
Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.
Thanks-

26:16.320 --> 26:17.765
Eve has been
living in the tunnels.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.001
For how long?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.685
I don't know.
Adalind just found out.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.616
I've got to get home
and deal with this.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.881
I'll drop you off. Then I'll
head back to the precinct.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.001
Did I order that?

26:32.080 --> 26:33.650
From the gentleman down the bar.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.209
You know that guy?
I don't think so.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.087
Hmm.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.925
What are you gonna do?

26:45.040 --> 26:46.371
Find out where my drink is.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.843
I don't know what
you think you're doing,

26:55.960 --> 26:57.405
but I'm going outside
for a smoke,

26:57.480 --> 26:59.528
where, if you have
the nerve to show your ass,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.568
I'm going to kick it
from here to Houston.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.924
Otherwise, you better be gone.
You got me?

27:05.920 --> 27:07.445
Loud and clear.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.601
Uh, bartender, if you please.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.681
Hi!

27:23.800 --> 27:25.006
Brought you a drink.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.009
What are you trying to do now?
Pick me up?

27:28.560 --> 27:31.609
No, I just felt sorry for you
since I'm picking up your girl,

27:31.800 --> 27:33.880
and we'll be having a real
good time, and you're not.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.606
Don't say I didn't warn you.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.241
Cheers.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.369
Thank you for the drink, but I think
you should probably get out of here.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.683
I don't think he was too happy
about you buying me a drink.

28:05.760 --> 28:06.966
Are you?

28:08.840 --> 28:09.841
Yeah.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.168
I did just meet him.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.047
Then it shouldn't be
too hard to forget him.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.406
Bartender!

28:21.800 --> 28:24.804
Round of drinks for everyone who
thinks it's a great night to be alive!

28:26.040 --> 28:28.646
Let's turn this music up, too,
get the party started, huh?

28:37.840 --> 28:39.649
Okay, let's do this. Okay.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.360
Whoo!

28:50.560 --> 28:52.483
What do you say you
and me take a walk?

28:53.840 --> 28:55.171
Sure.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.849
You are so much fun.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.444
Got to live for the moment.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.329
Did you carve all
that stuff in the tunnel?

29:18.360 --> 29:20.362
I'm not sure. I think so.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.680
I should've told you guys
I was down there.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.936
How long were you down there?

29:25.960 --> 29:29.362
Since Monroe and Rosalee's. I don't
even know how long that's been.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.770
I wanted to leave, and
then every time I tried,

29:34.800 --> 29:36.928
my body just couldn't move.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.730
Diana knew you were down there.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.888
She knew you were drawing.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.486
She was drawing the same thing.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.121
A lot of them are the same.

30:01.720 --> 30:06.203
I think it's time I told you I'm
sorry for what I did to you.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.928
I told Nick you were here.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.409
How are you feeling?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.206
Like I really shouldn't be here.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.960
I don't think you're in any condition
to go anywhere else right now.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.365
Who drew these? Diana.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.961
I saw them, too.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.601
Where?

30:36.080 --> 30:37.411
In the tunneL.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.521
You did this?

30:56.320 --> 30:59.164
Yeah, I remember
my hands were all cut up.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.524
They're not anymore.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.447
Where's all this coming from?

31:12.120 --> 31:15.363
I don't know. I think it's
connected to what healed us.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.405
Nick?

31:17.520 --> 31:18.521
Yeah?

31:18.600 --> 31:21.490
Hank's on the phone.
They've got another body.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.961
It is really pretty here.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.565
It's beautiful.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.569
How long have you lived here?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.642
In Portland? A long time.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.207
You know, years ago,

31:33.320 --> 31:36.608
all of this land was owned by a
very distinguished young gentleman

31:37.280 --> 31:40.648
who recognized the need to preserve
nature for future generations.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.685
It's too bad we can't thank him.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.641
I wonder what Portland
was like back then.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.371
Well, you would've been in
the minority, for one thing.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.249
In 1850,
this was a frontier town.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.450
There were five men
to every woman.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.444
I'd be happy with one good one.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.807
This is gonna make me crazy.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.496
Maybe it's somebody
you used to hunt with.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.806
What? No.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.440
How about one of Bud's friends?

32:10.480 --> 32:12.847
I think we kind of know
all of Bud's friends.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.964
What if it was a customer?
Yours or mine?

32:16.200 --> 32:17.201
Either.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.361
Maybe.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.721
I don't know.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.962
Maybe his hair was different
last time you saw him.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.009
Right! Hair.

32:33.760 --> 32:34.966
Mmm-mmm. Wrong.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.883
Try glasses or a beard.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.530
Yeah, glasses.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.681
No! Beard.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.687
Oh, my God.
I don't know this guy.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.930
What? You don't? After all this?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.729
No, I mean, I don't
know him personally.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.600
He's the guy from the park.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.041
Monroe, do you know him or not?
Yes, we both do!

33:01.240 --> 33:02.480
We've seen him 100 times!

33:02.560 --> 33:04.449
Who is it? William Stillman.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.696
The statue? He was one of
Portland's earliest settlers.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.087
The park is named after him.
Stillman Park.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.482
Oh, my God, that's where
the bodies were found.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.562
And the book said
it was an immortal Wesen.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.603
You're saying it's
actually William Stillman?

33:22.280 --> 33:23.725
You tell me.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.400
Ooh, we got to call Nick.
Call him.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.568
Same type of puncture wound.

33:29.040 --> 33:33.364
But Donald Simpson here has
his clothes, so why kill him?

33:35.600 --> 33:37.336
Bartender said the victim was
with a woman at the bar,

33:37.360 --> 33:39.931
but she left with another
guy who bought her a drink.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.048
ID'd him off
the composite. It's our guy.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.288
Monroe's FaceTiming me.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.321
Monroe. Nick, we know who it is!

33:48.440 --> 33:51.320
That's why I'm Face Timing you-We have
to show you-It's William Stillman!

33:51.960 --> 33:53.485
No, Monroe, that's the park.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.608
No, it's William Stillman.
The guy!

33:55.960 --> 33:58.327
I drew the beard on him.
It's the same guy.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.725
That's how I knew
I had seen him.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.480
The book said
he was immortal, right?

34:02.640 --> 34:03.880
And if he really comes up

34:03.960 --> 34:05.962
out of the ground only
once every seven years,

34:06.040 --> 34:08.485
and he comes up out of
the park, his park...

34:08.639 --> 34:11.041
I mean, come on-No wonder
he donated the /and-

34:11.480 --> 34:12.811
That's where
he's taking the girl.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.969
What girl?
The one he's gonna kill.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.841
Things haven't been going
so well for you.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.002
They haven't. I voted for you.

34:47.320 --> 34:48.889
Why did you quit?

34:49.440 --> 34:50.771
That wasn't me.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.126
Looked like you.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.287
You're telling me someone used a
Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester on you?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.362
That's not why I'm here.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.281
I need your help.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.051
Well, I didn't think you
came in to buy a guitar.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.648
What's the problem?
I'm being haunted.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.006
Hmm...

35:13.360 --> 35:15.488
Anybody you know? Yeah.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.531
Were you responsible
for the death?

35:17.600 --> 35:18.601
In a way.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.016
You wanna narrow
that down a little?

35:20.040 --> 35:21.929
Look, I killed him to put
him out of his misery,

35:22.040 --> 35:23.405
and this is the thanks I get.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.081
I just wanna know if it's real,
or if I'm losing my mind.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.128
All right, all right, all right.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.089
This isn't gonna be simple.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.481
What did you bring me
in order to find out?

35:36.920 --> 35:38.410
This was my father's.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.768
And his father's before him.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.961
Hmm.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.490
You want this bad. Yeah.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.480
How bad?

36:19.600 --> 36:23.127
All right, let's go find out
if this ghost is real.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.800
This way.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.445
Aspirateur d 'Esprits.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.840
Spirit vacuum?

36:54.800 --> 36:57.963
If any spirits are attached to
you, this will pull them out.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.923
What am I supposed to do?

37:02.280 --> 37:04.442
Take off your clothes
and get in.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.851
Seriously?

37:06.040 --> 37:08.360
You want to find out if your
haunting is reaL or don't you?

37:09.080 --> 37:10.880
If it's all in your head,
nothing will happen.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.250
What are you doing?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.845
I'm just taking it all in.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.528
Smell that air.
Listen to those crickets.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.886
Look at those stars.

37:32.320 --> 37:36.006
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it all?

37:37.600 --> 37:38.931
That's life.

37:39.920 --> 37:43.527
So many people just miss living.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.491
They don't appreciate
what they've got.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.161
Wow.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.050
I mean, you're right.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.330
We move too fast, don't we?

38:00.200 --> 38:01.850
I wanna kiss you.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.481
Really?

38:06.360 --> 38:09.330
Sometimes,
it's okay to move fast.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.131
Are you all right?

38:19.720 --> 38:21.927
I'm just so happy to be alive.

38:36.760 --> 38:41.561
You know, I think we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.801
I hope so.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.569
You hear those crickets?

38:55.680 --> 38:56.841
They sound so happy.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.051
Let's start where
the body was buried.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.729
You're the Grimm.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.650
Yeah.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.041
Thanks.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.286
What's a girl got to do to find
the right guy in this town?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.689
Ready? Get it over with.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.203
Shouldn't be too long now.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.966
No! No! No!

41:15.240 --> 41:20.963
Sc Portland's celebrated pioneer
was a 200-year-old cicada Wesen.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.286
Makes you wonder.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.727
How many bodies are
buried in this park?

41:27.360 --> 41:29.408
Or not.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.883
A mind is a terrible
thing to lose.
