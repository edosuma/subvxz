WEBVTT

00:08.965 --> 00:09.966
Hey, guys.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.533
Hey, Dave.
Hey, Gemma.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.317
We just came from
the farmers market.

00:13.361 --> 00:16.103
Buckle up,
persimmon season came early.

00:17.495 --> 00:20.759
Or as I like to call them,
apples with attitude.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.197
You want to try one?No, thanks.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.634
I had enough attitude
from my employees today.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.723
I'll be damned if
I get it from a fruit.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.639
Did something happen
at the shop?

00:30.682 --> 00:32.554
Yeah, another one
of our mechanics quit

00:32.597 --> 00:34.121
to go work
at Motor Boys,

00:34.164 --> 00:38.081
so this month alone we're down
a Rudy and two Julios.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.519
I mean, Julio I get,
that guy was never loyal,

00:41.563 --> 00:42.825
but Julio?

00:44.827 --> 00:46.046
I thought
we were friends.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.700
That's awful.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.050
Yeah. Why do you think
they left?

00:50.093 --> 00:52.574
They don't like the way
Calvin treats them.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.489
What are you talking about?
They love me.

00:54.532 --> 00:57.057
I'm the world's best boss.
It says so on my coffee mug.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.625
You're using the mug I gave you.

01:02.149 --> 01:05.195
And you thought
it was a dumb gift.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.198
Yes, because you
don't work for him.

01:10.026 --> 01:11.375
All I'm saying, Calvin,

01:11.419 --> 01:13.682
is you need to treat the guys
with more respect.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.119
I respect them.
It's not my fault

01:16.163 --> 01:18.078
they're too stupid
to understand.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.429
Okay. If we lose
one more mechanic,

01:21.472 --> 01:23.083
we're basically
a car wash.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.433
You know,
I can help you guys.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.348
This is exactly
what I do for my job.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.394
You work
at a car wash?

01:30.438 --> 01:33.267
No, I'm a conflict
mediator.

01:33.310 --> 01:36.226
I can go into your shop, talk
to your employees, and come up

01:36.270 --> 01:38.272
with ways that you can improve
your relationship with them.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.708
GEMMA:
He's really good.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.927
At the last school I worked at,
he settled a dispute

01:41.971 --> 01:44.104
between the football team
and the marching band.

01:44.147 --> 01:47.281
The football team
was beating up the band geeks?

01:47.324 --> 01:49.544
No, the other
way around.

01:50.762 --> 01:53.113
Our flute section
was gangsta.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.465
You know, baby, I think
we should let Dave help us.

01:57.508 --> 02:00.163
Fine, but if you
screw this up,

02:00.207 --> 02:02.339
I'm going flute section
on your ass.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.951
â™ª Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood â™ª

02:05.995 --> 02:07.301
â™ª Welcome to the hood.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.830
Oh, perfect.

02:14.873 --> 02:17.137
On time for dinner, but too late
to help set the table.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.356
God is good.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.184
Yeah, God had nothing
to do with it.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.838
I saw you peeking
through the window.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.710
Yeah, and I saw you stick your
finger in the mashed potatoes.

02:25.754 --> 02:26.972
You want to dance?

02:27.016 --> 02:28.365
Shh.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.585
Hey, what's up, boys?Hey, what's up, Pop?

02:30.628 --> 02:31.934
Yo, I heard
Julio quit.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.197
Uh, yeah, the hell
with that guy.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.373
No, I meant Julio.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.593
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.166
Oh, hey, Dave.
What's with the clipboard?

02:46.209 --> 02:47.776
Well, before I sit down
with your employees,

02:47.819 --> 02:49.430
I came by to see
what you had to say.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.432
Oh, here's what I have to say:
bye, Dave.

02:53.347 --> 02:57.177
Come on, Pop, you told Mom you
were gonna take this seriously.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.222
Yeah, besides that,
you know he's not going away.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.572
DAVE:
He's right. I'm not.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.228
Fine. Come on, man,
let's get this over with.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.100
Okay, first question:
what three words

03:08.144 --> 03:10.364
best describe
your leadership style?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.279
World's best boss.

03:13.758 --> 03:16.413
The mug says it,
and I agree.

03:16.457 --> 03:19.460
Okay, uh, if that's
how you feel,

03:19.503 --> 03:21.897
what do you think the root
of the problem is at the shop?

03:21.940 --> 03:24.291
That's easy, everyone else.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.729
Okay, I think I'm getting
a clearer picture

03:27.772 --> 03:28.991
of what the problem is.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.211
Yeah, and the picture
looks like this.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.343
Ha!

03:33.387 --> 03:36.259
Why the hell do your fingers
smell like mashed potatoes?

03:36.303 --> 03:37.608
Ooh!

03:39.610 --> 03:42.091
You know what?
Pop, y-you just afraid

03:42.134 --> 03:44.136
that people gonna say
bad stuff about you.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.877
Yeah, you know,
the truth.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.663
No. No, the problem is

03:48.706 --> 03:52.797
that no one understands I'm not
their friend, I'm their boss.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.322
If they want a friend,
they need to go on the Facebook.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.499
You know, Calvin, you don't need
to be their friends.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.152
Just 'cause you're their boss

04:00.196 --> 04:02.024
doesn't mean you can't have a
healthy relationship with them.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.548
I have a healthy relationship
with them.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.159
I'm like a loving father
that they're afraid of.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.640
Move, potato fingers, go.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.385
Ooh.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.866
Isn't that the cute girl that
moved in upstairs from you?

04:17.909 --> 04:19.389
Yeah, Keira.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.825
All right. Did you
ask her out yet?

04:20.869 --> 04:24.220
Yes, every morning
in my mirror.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.397
Well, have you done it
in front of somebody

04:27.441 --> 04:30.313
that's not wearing
Star Warspajamas?

04:30.357 --> 04:33.011
I can't, man.Why not, Marty?

04:33.055 --> 04:34.317
She makes me nervous.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.884
I get all mixed up and
tongue-tied around her.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.407
Well, you better get untied
because...

04:37.451 --> 04:38.887
here she comes.Oh, no! How much wood

04:38.930 --> 04:40.410
could a woodchuck chuck
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

04:40.454 --> 04:45.023
Hi, Marty.: Hi. Hey, Keira.

04:45.067 --> 04:48.070
Uh, you brother
my Malcolm, remember?

04:48.113 --> 04:49.332
Yeah, hi.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.943
So I see you got your mail.
You've got mail!

04:51.987 --> 04:54.250
Yeah, too bad
it's all bills.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.947
I've got student loans!

04:55.991 --> 04:58.907
It's funny
'cause she's in debt.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.475
You've got no money!

05:01.518 --> 05:03.128
Okay, well,

05:03.172 --> 05:04.652
I'll see you guys later.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.220
You're gonna
die alone.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.399
All right, guys, I'm here
to talk to you about ways

05:12.442 --> 05:14.792
Calvin and Tina can make this
a respectful atmosphere,

05:14.836 --> 05:16.925
productive workplace,
and most importantly,

05:16.968 --> 05:18.666
a safe space.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.458
Oh, a question. Yes?

05:28.502 --> 05:29.590
Yeah, are we getting paid
for this?

05:29.633 --> 05:31.374
Yes, you are.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.897
Great. Can you start
from the top again?

05:34.464 --> 05:37.032
Okay, basically, I'm gonna
ask you some questions

05:37.075 --> 05:39.034
about your issues and concerns.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.079
But won't we get in trouble
for what we say?

05:41.123 --> 05:44.344
No, because everything you say
will be strictly confidential,

05:44.387 --> 05:46.737
so none of you
have to worry

05:46.781 --> 05:50.001
about any of this getting back
to Tina or Calvin.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.047
Hey, hey, everybody!

05:54.571 --> 05:56.399
Cal-Calvin,
what are you doing here?

05:56.443 --> 05:59.446
Oh, I'm just bringing
some doughnuts for my boys.

05:59.489 --> 06:02.274
There is no "I" in "team,"
but there is one

06:02.318 --> 06:03.841
in "I love you guys."

06:05.408 --> 06:08.890
Uh, Calvin, I'm-I'm trying
to talk to your employees.

06:08.933 --> 06:11.327
Dave, I don't have employees.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.895
These guys are basically
like family.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.853
How's your wife, Norm?

06:15.897 --> 06:17.202
I'm not married.

06:18.465 --> 06:21.163
Well, too bad because
you're a real catch.

06:25.472 --> 06:28.518
Calvin, i-if this is gonna work,
you can't be here.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.913
Okay, all right, I'm gonna go,
all right? Hey, uh,

06:31.956 --> 06:33.871
quick update, guys,

06:33.915 --> 06:36.570
I just voted for
Employee of the Month,

06:36.613 --> 06:39.050
and congratulations,
you all won!

06:48.973 --> 06:50.322
Oh, you're not Keira.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.499
What was your first clue?

06:52.542 --> 06:55.893
That I'm not a woman or that
I'm talking to you?

06:55.937 --> 06:59.723
Well, for your information,
that's about to change.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.333
Oh, you finally asked her out?

07:01.377 --> 07:03.553
Better. I've devised an
elaborate plan to lure her

07:03.597 --> 07:06.208
to my apartment, where I'll be
on my own turf, and therefore,

07:06.251 --> 07:07.731
more comfortable
to ask her out.

07:08.906 --> 07:12.475
I call it
"Operation Date Keira."

07:12.519 --> 07:14.129
Yeah, that sounds
more to me like

07:14.172 --> 07:15.957
"Operation Restraining Order."

07:17.393 --> 07:19.221
No, trust me, man,
it's foolproof.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.876
This morning I put a piece
of my mail in her mailbox,

07:21.919 --> 07:23.834
which she will feel compelled
to return to me,

07:23.878 --> 07:25.445
and if she doesn't,
she's committed a felony,

07:25.488 --> 07:26.837
and I'm not interested.

07:26.881 --> 07:30.580
Marty, that is the dumbest
idea I've ever heard,

07:30.624 --> 07:32.713
and that includes Pop's plan
to buy a mannequin

07:32.756 --> 07:34.628
so he can ride
in the carpool lane.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.502
Dumb you say?

07:39.546 --> 07:41.504
That was the sound
of the elevator,

07:41.548 --> 07:44.942
and I hear the sound
of beautiful little footsteps.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.378
And here we go.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.824
Yeah, would you
look at that,

07:56.867 --> 07:59.130
you got jury duty.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.746
Ugh, what is
taking so long?

08:05.789 --> 08:07.965
I can't even believe
I'm about to say this,

08:08.009 --> 08:09.663
but when is Dave gonna get here?

08:09.706 --> 08:11.360
Baby, relax.

08:11.403 --> 08:14.624
Why are you so stressed out
about Dave's report?

08:14.668 --> 08:16.974
Because it's gonna be
full of lies about me.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.237
And if it says that I called
Norm a certain name,

08:19.281 --> 08:21.631
I didn't do it.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.981
And everybody laughed.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.682
Baby, you created
this situation,

08:28.725 --> 08:31.032
and now you have to deal
with the consequences.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.773
Like the time
that cop pulled you over

08:32.816 --> 08:35.558
for driving
with that mannequin.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.518
Well, they wouldn't have
pulled me over

08:38.561 --> 08:39.562
if the mannequin was white.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.998
Oh, stop.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.305
Hey, guys.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.176
Hey, come on in.Hey, Dave.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.831
So, uh, how'd it go
down at the shop?

08:47.875 --> 08:50.573
Really well, and you were right
about Norm.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.314
How is that guy single?

08:52.357 --> 08:55.491
Okay, so how
do we do this?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.015
Well, I usually start
by explaining my methodology

08:58.059 --> 08:59.756
and how I arrived
at my findings.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.890
Yeah, sounds good. We're not
gonna do any of that. Come on.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.588
All right, uh, well,
here's what I found:

09:05.632 --> 09:08.199
after numerous interviews,
it's clear that your employees

09:08.243 --> 09:09.505
have serious issues with...

09:09.549 --> 09:11.768
Norm's a liar!

09:19.646 --> 09:22.866
Okay, babe, relax.
I-I thought we agreed

09:22.910 --> 09:25.695
that we would accept
whatever Dave says, right?

09:25.739 --> 09:27.567
Well, I'm-I'm glad
you feel that way, Tina,

09:27.610 --> 09:28.959
because the complaints
weren't about Calvin,

09:29.003 --> 09:30.221
they were about you.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.397
What?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.922
You heard the man, Tina.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.750
Those idiots love me.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.279
Seriously?

09:44.322 --> 09:47.021
I'm the problem?
Calvin yells at everybody

09:47.064 --> 09:50.372
and calls them names,
and they blame me?

09:50.415 --> 09:54.289
It's funny
how that works, huh?

09:54.332 --> 09:55.899
Okay,

09:55.943 --> 10:00.295
okay, okay, tell me exactly
what these egg-sucking, two-bit,

10:00.338 --> 10:02.558
no-good punks said.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.561
Well, surprise, surprise,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.389
they find you to be
a little insulting.

10:10.392 --> 10:13.482
Fascinating. Go on.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.876
Okay, well, uh,
in general,

10:15.919 --> 10:17.965
they feel like
you don't respect their work

10:18.008 --> 10:20.532
and sometimes
can be a little unfair.

10:20.576 --> 10:24.362
Oh, my God. I mean,
I-I feel horrible.

10:24.406 --> 10:25.886
I mean, I would never--

10:25.929 --> 10:27.235
Give me that.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.499
I'm sorry, Tina.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.544
These interviews have got
to stay confidential.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.503
I took an oath.

10:34.546 --> 10:35.417
Really?

10:35.460 --> 10:37.375
Well, it's not an official one,

10:37.419 --> 10:40.378
but I made up my own
and I take it very seriously.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.120
You know, I respect that, Dave.

10:43.164 --> 10:46.733
Just like I respect
our employees at work.

10:46.776 --> 10:50.127
Ah.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.521
You are just loving this,
aren't you?

10:52.564 --> 10:54.741
Well-well, come on, Tina.
This isn't about me.

10:54.784 --> 10:58.179
This is about the shop.
And how mean you are there.

11:01.138 --> 11:05.012
Okay, look, the best
thing to do at this point

11:05.055 --> 11:07.710
is for me to sit down with the
two of you and your mechanics

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
and figure out some adjustments
that Tina can make.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.541
This is unbelievable!

11:12.584 --> 11:15.196
Look, come on, babe,
all joking aside,

11:15.239 --> 11:17.720
we cannot afford
to lose any more mechanics.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.941
So for the good of the shop,
you got to do this.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.509
You're right, baby.
You're right.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.033
If it's for the good
of the shop--

11:26.076 --> 11:28.078
Give me that!

11:34.041 --> 11:36.130
I took an oath!

11:40.569 --> 11:42.440
Yo, yo, yo.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.833
What's up, man?
What you doing here?

11:43.877 --> 11:45.487
Oh, I just came to
get some supplies

11:45.530 --> 11:49.056
for the next phase of
Operation Date Keira.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.579
Come on, Marty. I told you

11:50.622 --> 11:52.537
you are making this
way too complicated.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.887
No, I heard what you
said, which is why

11:53.930 --> 11:55.453
I made this one
way more simple.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.587
All I need is a tennis
racket and a frozen turkey.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.635
You do realize
if I hear any more,

12:03.679 --> 12:05.725
I will have to testify
against you.

12:05.768 --> 12:09.772
Okay, I... I know I'm
being a little crazy,

12:09.816 --> 12:11.948
but I'm-I'm not
like you, Malcolm.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.515
You could talk to girls
about anything.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.431
I got two subjects:
science and science fiction.

12:16.474 --> 12:19.782
Marty,
you're just making excuses, man.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.742
A-And all these ridiculous plans
are just half measures.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.135
If you really want
to go out with this girl,

12:25.179 --> 12:28.443
you just have to go all the way
and ask her out.

12:28.486 --> 12:31.141
Okay. You're right.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.664
All the way it is.All right.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.449
I'll see you later.

12:34.492 --> 12:37.626
Although, I could hire a
roller-skating mime to go to...

12:37.669 --> 12:38.583
Marty.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.629
Fine.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.196
I'll save that for the proposal.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.034
Hey, Tina.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.818
Dave told me about the report.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.646
How are you doing?Terrible.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.517
I feel so bad about
what's going on at the shop.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.390
I could really use
my girl's shoulder to cry on.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.608
I'm not giving you the folder.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.785
Damn it!

13:05.828 --> 13:07.743
Come on, Tina.
Finding out who said what

13:07.787 --> 13:09.832
isn't gonna make you
feel any better.

13:09.876 --> 13:13.923
Who said anything about
feeling better? I want revenge!

13:13.967 --> 13:16.883
Look, I get it. You're
hurt, you're angry,

13:16.926 --> 13:18.798
you're looking around for
the folder, which isn't here.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.497
Come on, Gemma.
You know, I've been up all night

13:22.540 --> 13:24.325
thinking about this,
and I think I finally realized

13:24.368 --> 13:25.543
what's going on here.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.545
Really? What?Sexism.

13:27.589 --> 13:28.764
Think about it.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.114
I am a female boss
in a shop full of men,

13:31.158 --> 13:34.204
and-- huh-- what a shocker,
I'm the problem.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.554
Wow. I hadn't
thought about that.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.556
Come on.
You are a school principal

13:38.600 --> 13:41.516
with a bunch of male employees
who work under you.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.518
You know they don't treat you
with the same respect.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.389
I know.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.739
I've had to deal with them
calling me "bossy,"Mm.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.785
"demanding," "bootylicious."

13:49.829 --> 13:51.178
What?

13:51.221 --> 13:55.225
Actually, that was Ms. Nelson,
the P.E. teacher.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.532
So you know what I'm saying.I do.

13:57.575 --> 13:58.663
So you're with me?Yeah.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.230
Sisters in arms?
Hell yeah!

14:00.274 --> 14:02.667
Oh, God, I'm so lucky
to have you as a friend.

14:02.711 --> 14:03.755
I'm still not
giving you the folder.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.019
Damn it!

14:07.585 --> 14:09.979
Hey. There's Keira.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.415
Now's your chance
to ask her out.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.895
No, man. Now's not the time.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.462
Our food's gonna get cold.

14:14.505 --> 14:17.247
Marty, we have frozen yogurt.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.120
Okay. You're right.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.643
No more half measures.

14:21.686 --> 14:22.687
All right.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.083
Hey, Keira.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.432
Oh, hey, Marty.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.912
Did you get the mail
I put under your door?

14:29.956 --> 14:31.479
What? That was you? Oh.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.002
Well, on behalf
of the U.S. justice system,

14:33.046 --> 14:35.222
you are guilty of being
a good neighbor.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.487
Uh, so, um...

14:39.530 --> 14:43.839
I was thinking,
maybe Friday night,

14:43.883 --> 14:47.147
you and I could go out on a date
together. All the way.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.324
Uh, to-to a restaurant.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.152
That's so sweet,

14:52.195 --> 14:54.850
but I actually have
a boyfriend back in Houston.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.157
Oh-- uh, uh, right, of course.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.680
Of course. Uh...

14:58.723 --> 15:00.551
"Houston, we have a boyfriend."

15:02.075 --> 15:04.729
But if it's okay with you,

15:04.773 --> 15:06.253
I'd love to be friends.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.950
Absolutely.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.648
I love friends. Almost as much
as I love the TV show.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.434
I'm kind of a black Chandler.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.915
Okay, well, I'll see you later.Okay.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.396
Aw, man, she has a boyfriend?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.616
Yep. She wants to be friends.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.445
I'm sorry, little bro.
That's a real bummer.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.577
Are you kidding? I'm in.

15:26.621 --> 15:29.493
It may have taken seven seasons,
but Monica married Chandler.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.106
Could this be a better day?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.764
Okay, everyone, this session is
for healing and moving forward.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.637
No one should feel threatened
or under attack.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.905
Okay-- Hey, guys, listen,

15:49.949 --> 15:52.690
Tina's gonna say a few words,

15:52.734 --> 15:57.260
and I'll just sit back and take
a sip from my favorite mug.

16:00.133 --> 16:04.093
Okay, well, let me start
by saying that I am sorry.

16:04.137 --> 16:07.096
It was not my intention
to make anyone uncomfortable.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.317
It's just, as a boss,
it's challenging

16:10.360 --> 16:13.755
to work with a bunch
of whiny-ass babies!

16:14.843 --> 16:16.714
DAVE:
O-Okay.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.803
In-in my professional
opinion, I think

16:18.847 --> 16:20.762
we should focus
on the words "I'm sorry"

16:20.805 --> 16:24.548
rather than every word
that came after that.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.942
TINA:
No, no, no, no.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.596
I'm sorry all right.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.381
Sorry that I am surrounded
by a bunch of male chauvinists

16:31.425 --> 16:34.819
who can't stand having
a woman as their boss.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.996
You got it all wrong.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.301
I don't care
that you're a woman.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.781
Yeah, neither do I.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.871
I mean, Julio did,
but Julio set him straight.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.004
Babe, come on, now.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.223
We're trying to save
our business here.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.660
So just admit
that you're the problem

16:49.704 --> 16:52.228
like I admitted that I wasn't.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.058
You know, I don't
believe y'all.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.017
Just because you say
you're not a sexist

16:58.060 --> 16:59.844
doesn't mean that you're not.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.064
I'm not a sexist. I just
didn't think it was fair

17:02.108 --> 17:03.761
that you docked my
pay last month.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.460
Lenny, you broke
the hydraulic jack.

17:06.503 --> 17:09.419
Calvin wanted to fire you.
I talked him out of it.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.073
You was gonna
fire me for that?

17:11.117 --> 17:13.554
It had sentimental value.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.252
I changed Quincy Jones's tire
with that jack.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.819
Wow.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.299
Okay, but what about

17:19.342 --> 17:21.910
when you made us
work overtime for a week?

17:21.953 --> 17:23.520
LENNY:
Yeah.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.523
That's because Calvin wanted you
to work on Christmas Day.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.091
I did that so you could be
with your families.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.266
What?
What?
Dang, Calvin.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.268
Hey. Hey!

17:32.312 --> 17:34.879
I was being
culturally sensitive.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.838
Any one of you could be Jewish.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.666
Okay, all right.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.930
You know, I see how this is.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.758
It's not about
sexism at all.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.325
It's Calvin.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.155
That does make way more sense.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.592
Mm-hmm. Right, right, right.

17:51.635 --> 17:52.984
So instead of being mad at me,

17:53.028 --> 17:55.030
you should be mad at
mug man over there.

17:56.858 --> 18:00.122
Tina, be respectful.
This mug was a gift.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.689
NORM:
No, no, no.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.951
She's right.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.301
I want to change my answer
to "Calvin."

18:05.345 --> 18:06.824
But can I keep it anonymous?

18:08.217 --> 18:10.698
Sit down.Okay, all right. Well,

18:10.741 --> 18:13.614
Calvin, given this new
and, well, in retrospect,

18:13.657 --> 18:15.877
unsurprising information,

18:15.920 --> 18:19.228
is there anything
you'd like to say?

18:19.272 --> 18:21.056
Yeah.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.972
Dave, you really messed this up.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.149
Calvin, these guys have been
with you for a long time.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.891
You really want to lose
them to Motor Boys?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.936
CALVIN:
Okay, look.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.896
Guys, I know that
I can be a tough boss,

18:34.939 --> 18:37.072
but that's because
I care about this place.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.900
And I care about you.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.424
I mean, this isn't some
run-of-the-mill chain

18:41.468 --> 18:43.426
like Motor Boys.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.211
This is a neighborhood shop.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.430
And that's because of the work
that you do.

18:47.474 --> 18:51.042
So, now that I hear you,

18:51.086 --> 18:54.959
I'll try to consider
your feelings more.

18:55.003 --> 18:58.920
But I think we can all agree
that from here on out,

18:58.963 --> 19:01.357
you're paying for the doughnuts.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.883
TINA: Really?DAVE: O-Okay.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.538
Well, look, Calvin, that's
a step in the right direction.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.454
Fellas, w-what do you say?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.631
S-Sounds fair to us.

19:14.675 --> 19:18.200
Good. All right,
well, as a sign of good faith,

19:18.244 --> 19:20.942
why don't you guys take
the rest of the day off?

19:20.985 --> 19:22.073
Okay.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.642
We close in ten minutes.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.122
You know what?
You're right. Why bother?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.428
Get back to work.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.603
TINA:
No, no, no.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.605
Don't listen to him.

19:31.648 --> 19:35.043
You can all leave now and come
in one hour later tomorrow.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.305
Right, Calvin?

19:36.349 --> 19:38.220
Sure.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.135
Yeah.Thank you.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.789
Thank you.Y'all got it.

19:41.832 --> 19:44.226
Well, all right. Okay.

19:44.270 --> 19:48.099
Another business saved,
relationships mended.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.101
You know, it's like
I always say:

19:50.145 --> 19:53.670
if everyone just slows down
and takes the time...

20:00.503 --> 20:02.418
This place is a death trap!

20:09.077 --> 20:11.993
So none of the mechanics
were sexist at all?

20:12.036 --> 20:15.039
No. In fact,
Terrell loves strong women.

20:15.083 --> 20:18.042
He has a giant back tattoo
that says "Mommy."

20:18.086 --> 20:20.958
Aw, that's so sweet.Mm-hmm.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.047
I hope Grover never
ever does that.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.182
Oh, hey, Calvin. I was
wondering where you were.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.663
Well, to say thank you
for what you did at the shop,

20:29.706 --> 20:31.578
I got you a little gift.Oh.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.144
Hey-- You shouldn't have.

20:33.188 --> 20:36.060
"World's Best Grandma"?

20:38.846 --> 20:40.978
Don't worry,
you'll grow into it.
