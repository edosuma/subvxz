<i> Kids, when Lily and Marshall
started trying to have a baby,</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:04.536
<i>they went a t ttle crazy.</i>

00:04.537 --> 00:06.772
We've been trying and trying,

00:06.773 --> 00:09.441
and still nothing's happened.

00:09.442 --> 00:12.244
I'm just worried we
can't have children.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.712
And how long have you been trying?

00:13.713 --> 00:15.681
Six days.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.850
Oy.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.387
<i>But then, months went by,
and still nothing happened.</i>

00:21.388 --> 00:22.621
Something must be wrong.

00:22.622 --> 00:24.823
W-We're doing it a lot.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.091
And everywhere--

00:26.092 --> 00:29.261
the kitchen, the bathroom,
the living room,

00:29.262 --> 00:31.797
outside in your wait-- the kitchen.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.032
Seriously, Doc,

00:33.033 --> 00:34.967
why isn't this happening? Look,

00:34.968 --> 00:36.936
if you're really worried,
here is a number

00:36.937 --> 00:40.706
for a reproductive
endocrinologist-- Dr. Stangel.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.942
<i>- He's the best in the city.
- Dr. John Stangel?</i>

00:42.943 --> 00:45.210
I don't know, baby,
do we really need a specialist?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.179
Well, what's your plan, Marshall,

00:47.180 --> 00:50.582
just have unprotected sex
day after day after day

00:50.583 --> 00:51.884
in every position imaginable

00:51.885 --> 00:53.419
until...?

00:53.420 --> 00:56.555
Wait, it sounded worse in my head.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.557
Guys, we've got a problem.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.858
This is the application

00:59.859 --> 01:00.960
for the regional doubles

01:00.961 --> 01:02.861
laser tag tournament

01:02.862 --> 01:04.196
in Poughkeepsie.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.665
Problem is, only one of
you can be my partner.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.968
So it looks like
we've got a bake-off.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.869
You may now present your arguments.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.938
I'm not playing laser tag. I'm
absolutely not playing laser tag.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.006
Damn it. And Marshall's

01:14.007 --> 01:16.075
the winner.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.043
Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.511
It can't hurt.

01:19.512 --> 01:22.314
<i> So Aunt Lily went to see Dr.
John Stangel, the man</i>

01:22.315 --> 01:23.983
<i>who knew more about human
reproduction</i>

01:23.984 --> 01:25.985
<i>than anyone in New
York City.</i>

01:25.986 --> 01:29.488
So I understand you
want to get pregnant.

01:47.035 --> 01:48.068
Yeah, and it cuts in and out. Ooh!

01:48.069 --> 01:49.904
How did you do it?

01:49.905 --> 01:52.840
Oh, God, you found
one of the cameras.

01:52.841 --> 01:54.108
I swear that's the only one.

01:54.109 --> 01:55.342
Wait, which one
did you find?

01:55.343 --> 01:56.443
What are you talking about?

01:56.444 --> 01:58.078
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:58.079 --> 02:01.549
My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.150
We'll look at all the
factors that contribute

02:03.151 --> 02:06.420
to fertility: dietary,
environmental, genetic.

02:06.421 --> 02:08.622
But first, Ms. Aldrin,

02:08.622 --> 02:10.291
do you have any questions

02:10.292 --> 02:11.492
for me?

02:11.493 --> 02:14.161
Just one, "Dr. Stangel."

02:14.162 --> 02:15.796
Where'd you get the beard?

02:15.797 --> 02:20.201
Well, m-my
mother's Armenian.

02:20.202 --> 02:23.270
Lily, I've been with
Barney since 9:00 a.m.

02:23.271 --> 02:25.105
Between the sexual harassment
seminar all morning

02:25.106 --> 02:27.341
and the secretary beauty
pageant all afternoon,

02:27.342 --> 02:29.476
he hasn't left my sight.

02:29.477 --> 02:31.912
Wait, so you weren't
wearing a fake beard

02:31.913 --> 02:33.981
and examining girl parts all day?

02:33.982 --> 02:36.116
Not today I wasn't.

02:36.117 --> 02:38.385
Wow, we finally found
Barney's doppelg nger.

02:38.386 --> 02:40.187
I guess we can tell you now, Lily.

02:40.188 --> 02:43.724
That hot dog guy did
not look like Barney.

02:43.725 --> 02:44.892
Uh, Marshall?

02:44.893 --> 02:46.227
Yes, I know,
we made our little deal

02:46.228 --> 02:47.528
with the universe, but...

02:47.529 --> 02:49.964
No, we've made a binding
covenant with the universe.

02:49.965 --> 02:51.999
We said we weren't going
to try to have kids

02:52.000 --> 02:54.301
until we saw Barney's doppelg nger.

02:54.302 --> 02:55.603
Oh, this is bad news.

02:55.604 --> 03:00.040
This is like a black cat
walked through my uterus.

03:00.041 --> 03:00.941
Okay, that's it.

03:00.942 --> 03:02.543
I am going back
to Dr. Stangel

03:02.544 --> 03:03.844
and getting thoroughly checked out.

03:03.845 --> 03:04.812
Or--

03:04.813 --> 03:06.881
or cost-saving alternative:

03:06.882 --> 03:09.950
you could get checked out by
someone who looks just like him.

03:09.951 --> 03:12.086
I'm gonna go scrub up;
I'll meet you in stall three.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.589
<i> I still</i>

03:15.590 --> 03:16.924
kind of think it's Barney.

03:16.925 --> 03:18.792
There's no way it's Barney.

03:18.793 --> 03:20.461
Hello, you must
be Mr. Eriksen.

03:20.462 --> 03:22.096
I am Dr. Stangel.

03:22.097 --> 03:23.230
It's Barney.

03:23.231 --> 03:24.798
Wow.

03:24.799 --> 03:27.835
Really, dude, bravo.

03:27.836 --> 03:29.336
You almost got a peek.

03:29.337 --> 03:30.571
But seriously,

03:30.572 --> 03:33.274
what second-rate community
theater did you get...?

03:33.275 --> 03:35.342
Would you...? I...

03:37.178 --> 03:39.680
So my wife and I are
trying to get pregnant.

03:41.983 --> 03:43.083
All right, Ms. Aldrin,
please just put

03:43.084 --> 03:44.251
your feet up in
the stirrups.

03:44.252 --> 03:45.686
We can begin.

03:45.687 --> 03:46.654
Uh-uh, no.

03:46.655 --> 03:48.555
Can't do it. No, but, baby,

03:48.556 --> 03:49.990
I yanked on his beard.

03:49.991 --> 03:51.292
He checks out.

03:51.293 --> 03:52.860
I really don't have time for this.
No, Barney--

03:52.861 --> 03:54.962
Doctor, wait, please, it's...

03:54.963 --> 03:56.664
Can you just give
us a couple minutes?

03:56.665 --> 03:57.831
I... Lily,

03:57.832 --> 04:01.936
how can I convince you
that this is not Barney?

04:03.104 --> 04:05.406
Wow, it is like looking

04:05.407 --> 04:08.275
into a poorly dressed mirror.

04:13.248 --> 04:15.516
Okay, you have to go.

04:17.685 --> 04:20.487
Leave the model of the vagina.

04:21.423 --> 04:23.424
Okay.

04:23.425 --> 04:24.591
Convinced.

04:24.592 --> 04:26.260
Great. All right,

04:26.261 --> 04:28.095
you're a little low on the table.
Please scoot up.

04:28.096 --> 04:29.797
"Suit up"-- not convinced.

04:29.798 --> 04:32.066
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.068
Baby, you just saw Barney.

04:34.069 --> 04:36.770
He could have pulled
some crazy switch.

04:36.771 --> 04:39.573
Remember when his Swedish
cousin came to visit?

04:39.574 --> 04:41.508
Oh, yeah-- Bjorney.

04:41.509 --> 04:45.245
Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I
see Barney at the same time,

04:45.246 --> 04:48.816
I-I'll never be sure that
Dr. Stangel isn't him.

04:50.085 --> 04:51.218
How you doing, Lily?!

04:51.219 --> 04:53.654
Should I have a boner?!

04:53.655 --> 04:54.788
Okay, we're all done.

04:54.789 --> 04:56.523
I'll call you in a few
days with the results.

04:56.524 --> 04:57.825
Thank you.

04:57.826 --> 04:59.860
Hey, you don't mind if I
take pictures, do you?!

04:59.861 --> 05:03.063
Can we leave him in
here for a while?

05:03.064 --> 05:04.031
I'm done for the day.

05:04.032 --> 05:05.432
You can leave him
in here all night.

05:05.433 --> 05:09.470
Aw, yeah.

05:09.471 --> 05:11.638
Smile for the birdie, Lil!

05:12.907 --> 05:15.809
Gyno-mite!

05:15.810 --> 05:17.945
<i> Now, while all this was going on,</i>

05:17.946 --> 05:21.181
<i>your Aunt Robin was starting her
new job at World Wide News,</i>

05:21.182 --> 05:22.583
<i>aka the big leagues.</i>

05:22.584 --> 05:23.851
<i>She was excited.</i>

05:23.852 --> 05:25.019
<i>This job was a new start,</i>

05:25.020 --> 05:26.720
<i>a clean slate. </i>

05:26.721 --> 05:29.456
So, first day of work?

05:31.559 --> 05:34.161
Everyone, say hello to
your new research associate

05:34.162 --> 05:35.195
Robin Scherbatsky.

05:35.196 --> 05:37.031
Hi, guys. Welcome.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.066
<i>Oh, here comes our new
Hardfire host.</i>

05:39.067 --> 05:42.236
Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.

05:42.237 --> 05:43.971
Sandy Rivers?!

05:43.972 --> 05:45.339
<i> Sandy Rivers--</i>

05:45.340 --> 05:47.741
<i>Robin's old cohost and
my old nemesis.</i>

05:47.742 --> 05:49.810
We should have sex.

05:49.811 --> 05:51.812
Oh, I hate that guy.

05:51.813 --> 05:53.147
It gets worse.

05:53.148 --> 05:54.548
Sandy, this is...

05:54.549 --> 05:56.216
Robin.

05:56.217 --> 05:58.285
You two know each other?
Know each other?

05:58.286 --> 05:59.319
We've had sex.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.821
<i> You had sex</i>

06:00.822 --> 06:02.189
with Sandy Rivers?

06:02.190 --> 06:03.524
No! Ugh!

06:03.525 --> 06:05.692
And I can't believe
it's my first day,

06:05.693 --> 06:08.529
and already I'm the girl who
slept with the host of the show.

06:08.530 --> 06:09.763
Already?

06:09.764 --> 06:11.365
Were you planning on eventually
sleeping with the host?

06:11.366 --> 06:13.901
Well, now that I know
it's Sandy, I'm not.

06:18.006 --> 06:19.006
Hey, babe.

06:19.007 --> 06:20.174
Hi, honey.

06:20.175 --> 06:21.909
There's a couple
messages on the machine.

06:21.910 --> 06:23.110
Your dad called.

06:23.111 --> 06:25.112
He wants to know if
you have any sixes.

06:25.113 --> 06:27.881
Yeah, uh, we got a game of
"Go Fish" going on the phone.

06:27.882 --> 06:29.116
P.S., Pops, go fish.

06:32.954 --> 06:34.621
Who's the second message from?

06:34.622 --> 06:36.290
Dr. Stangel's office.

06:36.291 --> 06:39.359
I'm extremely fertile.
You're extremely fertile!

06:39.360 --> 06:40.494
Oh, my God.

06:40.495 --> 06:42.262
I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

06:42.263 --> 06:44.364
I got to call my dad and
tell him the good news.

06:45.733 --> 06:50.604
...puts the ball on
the 44-yard-line.

06:54.242 --> 06:58.145
If you're fertile, um,
then that means I'm the problem.

07:03.847 --> 07:05.081
Okay, now you're being ridiculous.

07:05.082 --> 07:06.482
An hour ago, you didn't even think

07:06.483 --> 07:07.517
there was a problem.

07:07.518 --> 07:09.352
Well, I was just putting
on a brave face.

07:09.353 --> 07:11.821
Okay, think about it:
we've had unprotected sex

07:11.822 --> 07:14.991
203 times in the past four months.

07:14.992 --> 07:17.527
Obviously I'm the problem.

07:17.528 --> 07:18.528
Problem?!

07:18.529 --> 07:19.829
You can't get a girl pregnant.

07:19.830 --> 07:20.930
That's the dream.

07:20.931 --> 07:22.165
I'd give my firstborn

07:22.166 --> 07:25.301
to not be able to have children.

07:26.436 --> 07:29.038
So, second day of work?

07:30.774 --> 07:31.841
What's wrong?

07:31.842 --> 07:33.676
Oh, you didn't hear?
She's the office slut.

07:33.677 --> 07:34.677
Already?

07:34.678 --> 07:36.112
Oh, honey.

07:36.113 --> 07:38.915
I wish I was the
office slut.

07:38.916 --> 07:43.252
And we can explore how those
policy changes will affect Iraq.

07:43.253 --> 07:45.655
Yes.

07:45.656 --> 07:47.690
We definitely had sex.

07:47.691 --> 07:49.125
We did not have sex.

07:49.126 --> 07:50.793
Then why do I remember you?

07:50.794 --> 07:54.730
I don't know, maybe because I'm
a smart, talented, professional.

07:54.731 --> 07:56.299
No, none of those.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.333
Oh, I remember.

07:57.334 --> 07:59.435
We didn't have sex.

07:59.436 --> 08:00.770
Thank you.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.705
You're the girl who did the report

08:02.706 --> 08:03.673
on the carriage driver

08:03.674 --> 08:06.042
and slipped and fell
in horse poop...

08:06.043 --> 08:07.043
We did have sex.

08:07.044 --> 08:09.045
Oh, I-I remember now.

08:09.046 --> 08:10.112
Gregory,

08:10.113 --> 08:12.949
do me a favor.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.384
But this reporter
takes pride in-- whoa!

08:18.188 --> 08:20.189
And now everyone
calls me Scherpoopie.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.359
It's not funny. Robin,

08:23.360 --> 08:24.927
a word of advice: play along.

08:24.928 --> 08:27.463
Okay, the more you fight it,
the worse it's going to get.

08:27.464 --> 08:28.931
It's like when your
car slides on ice,

08:28.932 --> 08:30.499
- you steer into the skid.
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.634
Exactly!

08:31.635 --> 08:33.068
Or when your-- I don't know--

08:33.070 --> 08:34.804
friend invites you to a
laser tag tournament,

08:34.804 --> 08:35.804
you don't fight it.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.373
You just strap on the vinyl holster

08:37.374 --> 08:38.874
and race into that
abandoned JCPenney

08:38.875 --> 08:40.443
guns a-blazin'.

08:41.578 --> 08:42.778
I'm just agreeing with Ted.

08:44.081 --> 08:46.649
Oh, it's my dad.

08:50.954 --> 08:51.954
Aren't you going to get it?

08:51.955 --> 08:53.623
No, no, you know what?

08:53.624 --> 08:55.791
Um, I'm gonna get my
stuff checked out first.

08:55.792 --> 08:56.859
I'll call my dad

08:56.860 --> 08:59.195
after Dr. Stangel gives
me the thumbs up.

08:59.196 --> 09:01.731
Ew! He has to do that?

09:01.732 --> 09:04.233
But I thought you talk to
your dad about everything.

09:04.234 --> 09:06.302
I only like to call
my dad with good news.

09:06.303 --> 09:07.603
I mean, telling him good news

09:07.604 --> 09:09.772
is what makes it feel real to me.

09:09.773 --> 09:11.173
I'm getting married!

09:11.174 --> 09:13.009
Yeah...!

09:13.010 --> 09:14.510
I passed the bar!

09:14.511 --> 09:16.312
All right!

09:16.313 --> 09:17.947
I found an amazing Viking lamp

09:17.948 --> 09:19.415
that fits right on
the coffee table,

09:19.416 --> 09:21.584
as long as we don't mind
stepping over the cord.

09:21.585 --> 09:23.886
That's what I'm
talking about! Right?!

09:23.887 --> 09:26.489
I found someone who can
fix the Viking lamp!

09:29.660 --> 09:31.527
But the news that I
might not be able

09:31.528 --> 09:32.928
to give him a grandchild?

09:32.929 --> 09:34.930
You know, like, I don't even know

09:34.931 --> 09:36.766
how to have that conversation.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.502
I'll show you.

09:39.503 --> 09:42.605
"Dad, there's, uh, there's
something I need to tell you,

09:42.606 --> 09:45.708
"and it's going to come as
a bit of a shock to you,

09:45.709 --> 09:47.843
"but here goes.

09:47.844 --> 09:49.011
"You are speaking

09:49.012 --> 09:52.982
to the 2011 Tri-County
Laser Tag Co-Champion."

09:52.983 --> 09:55.284
Barney, I've already told... "Oh,
and my sperm don't work.

09:55.285 --> 09:56.385
"Yeah, yeah,

09:56.386 --> 09:59.388
<i>the laser tag thing is awesome."</i>

10:01.525 --> 10:04.760
So, third day of work?

10:06.963 --> 10:08.464
And the fertilizer
is seeping

10:08.465 --> 10:10.333
into the ground water, causing...

10:10.334 --> 10:13.069
Is Scherpoopie pitching
a story about manure?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.339
Genius.

10:16.340 --> 10:20.076
Okay, yes, I, uh,
I fell into some manure.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.677
It's hilarious, fine.

10:21.678 --> 10:23.946
In a five-year career
of on-air reports,

10:23.947 --> 10:26.549
there are bound to be a
few embarrassing moments.

10:26.550 --> 10:28.384
A few?

10:28.385 --> 10:32.054
Uh, but in my case,
it was just the one,

10:32.055 --> 10:34.824
and you found it, so, uh...

10:34.825 --> 10:36.225
Just the one.

10:37.060 --> 10:40.096
Gregory.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.230
Oh, God.

10:41.231 --> 10:43.265
What did they find?

10:47.938 --> 10:50.406
Everything.

10:50.407 --> 10:54.510
* Everybody, come and play *

10:54.511 --> 10:57.513
I'm a dirty, dirty girl.
* Throw every last care away *

10:58.582 --> 11:02.752
* Let's go to
the mall today *

11:02.753 --> 11:04.253
* Today, today *

11:04.254 --> 11:06.555
The Federal Reserve Board
voted to leave interest...

11:06.556 --> 11:08.290
* Let's go to the mall *

11:08.291 --> 11:10.359
* Today
Let's go to the ma-a-all *

11:10.360 --> 11:12.962
Aah. * Let's got
to the mall today *

11:12.963 --> 11:14.330
* Let's go to the
ma-a-all * Today *

11:14.331 --> 11:15.898
* Let's go to the mall *

11:15.899 --> 11:17.333
* Today
Let's go to the ma-a-all *

11:17.334 --> 11:19.635
* Today...
Let's go to the mall... *

11:19.636 --> 11:22.872
They even found the video of
me getting attacked by an owl.

11:22.873 --> 11:24.573
You got attacked by an owl?

11:24.574 --> 11:26.776
I did not get attacked by an owl.

11:26.777 --> 11:28.978
Robin, listen,
here's what you need to do--

11:28.979 --> 11:31.814
Okay, don't you dare tell me
to steer into the skid, okay?

11:31.815 --> 11:35.184
It's too late. I'm already
wrapped around a hydro pole.

11:35.919 --> 11:37.086
It's a Canadian
telephone pole.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.722
I never should have taken this job.

11:39.723 --> 11:42.358
<i>Kids, at that moment,
I knew what I had to do</i>

11:42.359 --> 11:43.559
<i>for my friend Robin.</i>

11:43.560 --> 11:45.795
<i>But first I had to do
something for me.</i>

11:45.796 --> 11:49.398
Show me "owl attack."

11:50.500 --> 11:52.368
I am freaking out.

11:52.369 --> 11:54.270
Is there a chance that
I can't have kids?

11:54.271 --> 11:56.238
I've been hit in the nuts a lot.

11:56.239 --> 11:58.674
Well, we won't know anything
until we run some tests.

11:58.675 --> 12:00.543
We'll need a sample of your sperm.

12:00.544 --> 12:02.211
No, no, no.

12:02.212 --> 12:03.245
There's a room at
the end of the hall.

12:03.246 --> 12:04.480
If you find yourself

12:04.481 --> 12:06.715
inside the elevator,
you've gone too far.

12:06.716 --> 12:07.783
You'd think I wouldn't
have to say that,

12:07.784 --> 12:08.918
but you'd be surprised.

12:14.324 --> 12:15.658
All yours, buddy.

12:25.735 --> 12:29.104
The thing you're
about to do in here--

12:29.105 --> 12:31.307
I did that in here, too.

12:31.308 --> 12:33.809
Three minutes ago.

12:34.611 --> 12:37.513
I was here eight minutes ago.

12:37.514 --> 12:39.548
14 minutes ago.

12:40.317 --> 12:42.985
I'm here every Thursday.

12:44.955 --> 12:47.957
I can't do it, Doc.

12:47.958 --> 12:49.391
Is there, like, another option?

12:49.392 --> 12:51.093
Could I... Could I take this home?

12:51.094 --> 12:52.728
Sure, you could, but, uh...

12:52.729 --> 12:54.964
we close in an hour and
I'm not back till Tuesday.

12:54.965 --> 12:57.833
So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.

12:57.834 --> 13:01.403
Only way I know how, Doc.

13:01.404 --> 13:03.739
Only way I know how.

13:08.845 --> 13:10.112
Surprise! Surprise!

13:14.385 --> 13:16.086
Mom. Dad. Uh...

13:16.087 --> 13:17.321
What are you doing here?

13:17.322 --> 13:18.722
We hadn't heard from
you in a couple days.

13:18.723 --> 13:20.057
We were worried about you.

13:20.058 --> 13:22.192
For God's sake, son.
Do you have any sixes?

13:22.193 --> 13:23.660
Go fish.

13:24.662 --> 13:25.996
Excuse me. Hey, Lily,

13:25.997 --> 13:28.532
can I just talk to you in
here for a minute? Oh, yeah.

13:28.533 --> 13:31.201
Isn't it great?
They just showed up.

13:31.202 --> 13:33.403
Your mom's already
rearranged my kitchen,

13:33.404 --> 13:35.472
organized my closet...

13:35.473 --> 13:37.374
and she asked me if I lost height.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.276
Not weight. Height.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.145
Yeah, I'm very excited
that they're here, too.

13:41.146 --> 13:44.515
But right now, I have to get
excited about something else.

13:44.516 --> 13:47.584
Oh, okay. Well,
I'll go handle your parents.

13:47.585 --> 13:50.287
And you handle your, well...

13:50.288 --> 13:53.023
Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.

13:54.225 --> 13:56.293
Thank you, baby. You're the best.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.565
Marshall. Marshall.

14:01.566 --> 14:04.835
I just got my new bathing suit
for the beach this summer.

14:04.836 --> 14:07.271
It's a two-piece.
I mean, can you imagine?

14:07.272 --> 14:08.806
Me in a two-piece

14:08.807 --> 14:10.307
bathing suit at my age?

14:10.308 --> 14:11.608
Just picture it!

14:11.609 --> 14:13.310
Picture it!

14:13.311 --> 14:14.878
That's why Fred Cox

14:14.879 --> 14:16.780
is the greatest kicker
the Vikings ever had.

14:17.582 --> 14:20.584
Seriously, Marshall, picture it.

14:20.585 --> 14:22.152
Just picture it.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.620
Give me a "C." Give me an "O."

14:23.621 --> 14:24.822
Give me an "X."

14:24.823 --> 14:27.224
What's that spell? Cox! Cox!

14:27.225 --> 14:30.194
Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox!

14:30.195 --> 14:32.162
Uh...

14:32.163 --> 14:35.332
Okay, I did a bad thing last night.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.434
I looked up his address.

14:37.435 --> 14:40.037
Who?

14:40.038 --> 14:41.872
Sorry. You said "who."

14:41.873 --> 14:43.440
It reminded me of the owl footage.

14:43.441 --> 14:44.608
Genius.

14:44.609 --> 14:45.776
No.

14:45.777 --> 14:47.711
Sandy. How dare he laugh at you.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.413
Who does he think...

14:49.414 --> 14:50.781
Sorry. "Who."

14:51.649 --> 14:53.317
Anyway.

14:53.318 --> 14:54.918
I looked up his address
in your contact list.

14:54.919 --> 14:56.887
Oh, God. Tell me you
didn't go over there.

14:56.888 --> 14:59.623
I just thought he needed
to listen to common sense

14:59.624 --> 15:01.124
and reasonable discourse.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.594
Oh, God. Tell me those aren't
the names of your fists.

15:03.595 --> 15:05.295
They're my feet.

15:05.296 --> 15:06.630
I'm actually
more of a kicker.

15:07.432 --> 15:09.666
So I went to his apartment.

15:13.638 --> 15:15.906
Ah...

15:21.579 --> 15:23.881
You're not the pizza guy.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.920
Oh, my God. This is...

15:29.921 --> 15:32.589
This is how you make sure Sandy
never makes fun of you again.

15:32.590 --> 15:35.359
I told you to steer into the skid.
That was bad advice.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.693
So new advice.

15:36.694 --> 15:39.096
Steer into Sandy, and run him down.

15:39.097 --> 15:42.099
If people found out
Sandy wears a toupee...

15:42.100 --> 15:44.101
Really? That's
your take-away?

15:44.102 --> 15:46.103
Nothing on the
bear in the bra?

15:46.104 --> 15:47.604
Oh, no. He's very open about that.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.106
That's Gregory.

15:49.107 --> 15:50.474
Nice guy.

15:51.376 --> 15:53.410
And the top is so low-cut.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.845
Your father says he has

15:54.846 --> 15:57.714
front-row seats to
the Minnesota Twins.

15:57.715 --> 15:59.283
Oh. Oh.

15:59.284 --> 16:00.918
By the way, Marshall,

16:00.919 --> 16:03.687
we do need to know if you're
coming to Florida this summer.

16:03.688 --> 16:04.855
Are you coming?

16:04.856 --> 16:06.156
Marshall?

16:06.157 --> 16:08.859
Marshall, are you coming?

16:10.828 --> 16:13.130
This isn't working.

16:13.131 --> 16:14.631
Where you going, son?

16:14.632 --> 16:16.300
I'm-I'm going to...

16:16.301 --> 16:18.869
I'm-I'm going to...

16:18.870 --> 16:22.105
<i>Kids, to this day, your uncle
Marshall is thankful</i>

16:22.106 --> 16:23.707
<i>for what Lily said next.</i>

16:23.708 --> 16:24.908
He's going to masturbate.

16:24.909 --> 16:26.076
Lily!

16:26.077 --> 16:28.111
Marshall, just tell
them what's going on.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.182
<i>And so Marshall told his
parents everything.</i>

16:32.183 --> 16:34.017
And so, now, I'm just scared

16:34.018 --> 16:36.119
that we won't be able to
give you a grandchild.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.388
Aw, Marshall.

16:38.389 --> 16:40.857
Hey, we don't care
about that one bit.

16:40.858 --> 16:43.527
And if you guys want kids,

16:43.528 --> 16:44.962
there are other ways.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.363
Adoption.

16:46.364 --> 16:49.933
Maybe you have a good friend
who could loan you some sperm?

16:51.235 --> 16:53.637
Aw, yeah.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.841
Maybe adoption.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.177
What I'm saying is,

17:00.178 --> 17:02.612
we love you no matter what.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.883
Now, why don't you pretend
you're in high school,

17:06.884 --> 17:08.785
get back in that bathroom,

17:08.786 --> 17:11.320
and "blow dry your hair."

17:12.656 --> 17:13.890
Wait, you knew?

17:13.891 --> 17:16.593
We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.

17:16.594 --> 17:19.396
So?

17:19.396 --> 17:21.897
Possibly last day of work?

17:21.898 --> 17:24.768
Actually, it was a good day.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.069
And I need more numbers

17:26.069 --> 17:29.239
on how the holiday season
impacted the economy.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.409
Sparkles,
got anything on malls?

17:34.779 --> 17:36.780
Actually, Sandy,

17:36.781 --> 17:39.683
I have something I think
you're all gonna want to see.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.453
Yes! Put him in a body bag!

17:43.454 --> 17:45.555
Hoo! Hoo! Hyah!

17:45.556 --> 17:47.257
Okay, I didn't do it. What?

17:47.258 --> 17:49.326
I didn't want to just
viciously attack someone

17:49.327 --> 17:50.827
out of the blue
like some kind of...

17:50.828 --> 17:52.896
Owl? Exactly.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.198
So, instead of taking your advice,

17:55.199 --> 17:56.800
I took your advice.

17:59.971 --> 18:02.973
<i>That day, Robin decided to
steer into the skid.</i>

18:04.409 --> 18:06.443
<i>And though she never quite
shook the nickname,</i>

18:06.444 --> 18:09.346
<i>Sparkles went on to do very
well at World Wide News.</i>

18:09.347 --> 18:11.581
<i>Especially after
this happened.</i>

18:16.721 --> 18:19.289
<i>After his parents had gone
back to Minnesota,</i>

18:19.290 --> 18:21.124
<i>Marshall got the results
of his test.</i>

18:21.125 --> 18:24.127
I'm afraid I have some
very bad news, Marshall.

18:25.663 --> 18:28.865
Judging from the results
of your test, it is...

18:28.866 --> 18:31.835
it is very unlikely that you'll
be able to father a child.

18:31.836 --> 18:33.970
Oh, God.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.305
I know, I know.

18:35.306 --> 18:36.873
It's just...

18:36.874 --> 18:39.176
Now...

18:39.177 --> 18:41.445
in some rare cases,
a regimen change

18:41.446 --> 18:42.712
can fix the problem,

18:42.713 --> 18:46.149
so I'm recommending a
spirited cardio routine.

18:46.150 --> 18:47.517
Preferably

18:47.518 --> 18:48.718
with a partner,

18:48.719 --> 18:51.221
involving any light-based
firearm activity

18:51.222 --> 18:53.390
in the Tri-State area.

18:53.391 --> 18:56.193
Poughkeepsie, for example.

18:56.194 --> 18:57.994
Have you heard of the
gentlemen's sport

18:57.995 --> 19:00.564
known as laser tag?

19:01.165 --> 19:02.566
Surprise!

19:02.567 --> 19:03.967
Damn it, Barney!

19:03.968 --> 19:06.002
What are you doing in here?

19:06.003 --> 19:07.571
Think about it, Marshall.

19:07.572 --> 19:09.806
All entrants get 20%
off at the snack bar!

19:09.807 --> 19:11.441
Oh, BT-dub,

19:11.442 --> 19:12.676
the receptionist.
What's her situation?

19:12.677 --> 19:15.445
Go!

19:16.814 --> 19:18.014
Well, Marshall.

19:18.015 --> 19:19.716
I've got your results.

19:19.717 --> 19:21.785
And?

19:21.786 --> 19:24.754
Your sperm is fine.

19:24.755 --> 19:26.590
My sperm is fine!

19:29.427 --> 19:31.261
Count, motility...

19:31.262 --> 19:34.131
everything's off the charts.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.534
You, sir, have got
some strong swimmers.

19:38.369 --> 19:39.436
Bro, that is awesome.

19:39.437 --> 19:41.238
- Motility five!
- Whoa!

19:41.239 --> 19:43.773
Nice.

19:43.774 --> 19:45.308
Hey, um, can I borrow your phone?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.477
I want to call my dad.
Yeah, go ahead.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.881
Man, this is great.

19:50.882 --> 19:52.516
I was expecting bad news.

19:52.517 --> 19:54.484
I really was.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.801
You're here! Oh, my God!

20:11.802 --> 20:14.037
I love you so much!
Can you believe it?

20:14.038 --> 20:17.340
Marshall...

20:17.341 --> 20:18.808
Something's happened. Um...

20:19.944 --> 20:23.046
Your father, he had a heart attack.

20:23.047 --> 20:27.284
He... He didn't make it.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.457
My dad's dead?

20:53.811 --> 20:55.946
I'm not ready for this.

20:56.305 --> 21:02.773
