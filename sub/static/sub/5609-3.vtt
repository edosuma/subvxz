NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:03.212 --> 00:06.955
The most powerful sorcerer
in all the realms is stuck inside a tree?

00:07.049 --> 00:08.084
And you think we can get him out?

00:08.175 --> 00:09.290
Merlin's prophecies are never wrong.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.715
This rose is now linked to your beast.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.417
As long as it still has petals, he lives.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.220
Just because I'm the Dark One
doesn't mean we can't still be together.

00:15.307 --> 00:16.638
They're here to destroy the Dark One.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.805
But helping them may be the only way

00:17.893 --> 00:18.928
Iâ€™ll ever get my hands on that dagger.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.008
REGINA: Merlin 's tower.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.355
There must be something in here
to get him out of the tree.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.395
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: You can make
that weapon whole again.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.565
And use it to snuff out the light.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.645
(DWARFS WHISTLING)

00:35.494 --> 00:37.985
Our yield's way down, boys.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.115
I know Dopey's a tree,

00:39.206 --> 00:41.572
but we gotta be more productive
since he can't.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.658
-He's producing oxygen.
-(LAUGHS)

00:47.047 --> 00:48.036
DARK SWAN: Yes.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.840
No one wants a nasty surprise.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.504
You're not getting any dust, sister.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.883
Actually, I'm shopping
for something else today.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.469
Something with edge.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.725
My ax.

01:05.816 --> 01:09.058
Oh, Happy, there's something I learned
as the Dark One.

01:10.821 --> 01:15.030
If your name is on something,
hold on to it.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.539
REGINA: If we're going to free Merlin,
we need witchbane.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.715
BELLE: Yeah,
but the labels are all faded.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.669
EMMA: Forget the de-cloaking potion.
It's not a glamor anyway.

01:36.763 --> 01:37.752
REGINA: You sure?

01:37.848 --> 01:42.262
If I'm getting this right, the tree could
actually be him, transfigured, right?

01:42.352 --> 01:43.762
We could find out with a sample.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.311
Yeah, and when we snap off a twig
and it turns into a finger,

01:46.398 --> 01:47.604
who's crying then?

01:47.691 --> 01:49.101
Come on, someone, witchbane.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.689
You guys sure you don't want me
to just wiggle my nose

01:52.779 --> 01:53.768
and get him out of that tree?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.149
No!

01:55.240 --> 01:58.277
Your magic is dark now. It's not worth it.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.656
I'll just keep pretending to be
the Savior destined to free him

02:01.747 --> 02:03.533
and we can do this together.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.909
-Regina's right, Emma.
-(DOOR OPENS)

02:05.792 --> 02:06.998
ARTHUR: I heard
someone say a woman is right.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.119
It's always a safe assumption,
isn't it, David?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.835
How are you progressing,
Madame Savior?

02:13.925 --> 02:16.211
Um, progress. Slow but sure.

02:16.303 --> 02:21.388
Uh, it's marvelous having
Merlin's own books to work with.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.887
-|t's like talking with the master.
-Oh.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.893
What if we could talk to him?

02:26.938 --> 02:27.973
What?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.396
Yes.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.399
You are, very occasionally, a genius.

02:33.487 --> 02:38.322
Yes, if we talk to him,
he can tell us how to get him out.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.117
A mushroom.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.868
Toadstool, actually. Deadly poison.

02:46.958 --> 02:51.702
Extremely useful in communicating
across barriers, even through spells.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.038
Says here it's called
"The Crimson Crown."

02:55.342 --> 02:56.878
Yes, I know this name.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.836
lt's rumored to grow in Broceliande,
the Forest of Eternal Night.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.887
lts existence
is the stuff of legend though.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.839
Almost certainly fiction.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.176
Well, people say
the same thing about us. How far?

03:07.270 --> 03:10.933
A half day's ride. But if it is there,
it'll be protected by magical forces.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.519
No, David, wait until we know more.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.818
It's not like I'm needed here,
and it's a chance.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.729
I'm taking it.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.908
Hold!

03:23.995 --> 03:26.281
Your Majesty,
don't try to talk me out of this.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.408
I wouldn't dream of it.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.365
ljust wanted to propose, Prince David,

03:29.459 --> 03:31.836
if it's quite all right with you,
that I come along and lend aid?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.161
Come with me
and we can get ourselves outfitted.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.463
And then we can quest together
as brothers.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.223
This question mark?
That's my handwriting.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.766
I must've marked this page in Camelot.

03:48.854 --> 03:53.473
I don't know if this is the right answer,
but these books came from there.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.229
I think we were looking at this
for answers.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.605
We've been violated!

03:58.697 --> 03:59.937
What's the problem?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.192
What do you think it is? Your kid!

04:02.284 --> 04:03.569
She took my ax.

04:03.660 --> 04:08.074
Uh, dwarfs are your department.
I'll stay on this.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.575
What do you want us
to do about it, Leroy?

04:09.666 --> 04:10.655
LEROY: Help us.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.745
We know she's your daughter,
but you gotta do something.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.451
'Cause if you won't, we will.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.207
Do not hurt her.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.378
It's okay. They can't.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.081
Like that's all that matters?

04:19.176 --> 04:20.586
Stop being a scared parent.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.292
Be our sheriff again. We need you.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.594
DAVID: I'll see about getting the ax back.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.046
Thanks for letting us know.

04:26.141 --> 04:30.976
Looks like just another insult
for us to swallow down. For now.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.025
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

04:47.996 --> 04:49.987
Why does she need an ax?
That's alarming, right?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.787
I don't know. I mean,
what can she do with an ax

04:51.875 --> 04:54.082
that she couldn't
just do with her powers?

04:54.753 --> 04:55.742
David!

04:55.837 --> 04:56.997
| just wish she'd talk to us.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.419
I know! Me too.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.458
The worst part is, we can't save her.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.258
Yet. We're trying.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.211
How? What am I doing?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.295
You're leading.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.675
Nobody seems to be following.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.052
Don't worry about the dwarfs.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.226
I'm not. I'm worried about Emma,
and how this is my fault!

05:13.313 --> 05:16.100
She made the choice to save everyone.

05:16.191 --> 05:20.275
I should've stopped her. I'm her father.
And now I'm...

05:21.905 --> 05:24.191
l'm paralyzed.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.782
There's nothing I can do,
for her, for you, for anyone.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.279
You are doing something.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.737
You're helping our people
the best you can.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.906
That's kind of the problem.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.707
Hey.

05:41.091 --> 05:45.084
In any world, you are my hero.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.588
Remember?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.265
Of course.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.259
Go.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.594
I've got it.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.367
Good morning to you, Sheriff.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.292
Your Majesty. How can I help you?

06:20.380 --> 06:21.711
Any luck finding your blade?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.629
Uh, no luck finding Excalibur, I'm afraid,

06:23.675 --> 06:26.291
but I'm coming to you
with something far more urgent.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.967
Our reliquary has been robbed.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.469
I'm sorry, your what?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.047
Magical relics collected
by the knights of the Round Table.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.848
They're all very precious.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.684
I had no idea it was here until
it turned up in this land, nearly empty.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.314
When you say precious...

06:38.356 --> 06:39.687
There was a magic bean inside.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.023
This bean can take my people home
in an instant.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.980
I have to tell you,
I will find it if! have to

06:45.071 --> 06:46.607
search every residence in your city.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.032
You don't have to do anything alone.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.238
You can help?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.487
I'll get you back to Camelot, I promise.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.363
Thank you.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.086
A dwarf ax!
Now that's a creative path to failure.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.508
Dwarf axes cut through everything.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.841
Nothing cuts through magic.
Except maybe a kiss.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.676
Have you thought about kissing it out?

07:17.187 --> 07:20.679
(GIGGLES)
You're running out of options, dearie.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.107
You see, we want you
to snuff out the light,

07:24.194 --> 07:28.187
so we need a hero
to pull Excalibur from the stone.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.273
Now, let's face facts,
that's not gonna be you.

07:31.368 --> 07:35.202
So why don't you stop messing around
and go get the hero we need?

07:35.288 --> 07:39.702
Oh, and you and I both know who that is.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.002
(SIGHS)

07:48.051 --> 07:50.713
It's all right. You'll get it.

07:51.930 --> 07:57.050
Perhaps it's time for a spot of tea.
Calm nerves lead to clear thoughts.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.479
You're here so I can keep
an eye on you, mute handmaiden.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.737
I don't need you rolling your eyes at me.
We need to clear the air.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.697
-Fine.
-(WHOOSHING)

08:16.830 --> 08:19.412
Oh, oh, oh.

08:19.499 --> 08:23.583
There you are, my lovely voice.
It's so light and feminine.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.659
Enough!

08:27.507 --> 08:31.420
Now, let's have a little chat about
you trying to escape back to Oz.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.805
Zelena,

08:36.641 --> 08:40.259
you know you can't take
that child away from Robin.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.937
Well, can you blame me?
You're going to take it from me.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.434
This child could be my only chance
for someone to truly love me and...

08:49.529 --> 08:51.770
I mean, you got a second chance,
why can't I?

08:51.865 --> 08:55.824
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you've had a second chance.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.944
And a second second chance!

08:59.539 --> 09:02.201
You can't keep painting
yourself as a victim.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.787
It's absurd.

09:04.836 --> 09:08.954
You can tell me that
life is fair all you want.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.210
All I can tell you is that from in here,

09:11.301 --> 09:12.882
I'm still seeing one sister
with all the toys...

09:12.969 --> 09:13.958
(WHOOSHING)

09:14.220 --> 09:17.804
Be quiet and listen for once in your life.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.848
You forgot who I am.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.303
The Evil Queen.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.979
I can be a far greater nightmare
than you can possibly imagine.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.018
But now?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.188
My gift to you

09:35.575 --> 09:37.031
is a promise.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.329
I will make sure your baby is fine,

09:42.999 --> 09:46.366
and loved and safe.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.335
Just as I promise,

09:51.508 --> 09:54.341
the same will certainly not hold for you.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.889
Wow.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.762
I like to be prepared.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.358
Was that Percival's chair?

10:21.704 --> 10:22.693
Yes.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.908
But no need for more apologies.
A leader does what needs to be done.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.909
I'll find a man worthy to fill that seat.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.630
This is the one
that will stand empty forever.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.925
I assumed that was your chair.
It's suitable for a king.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.966
No. No, no, no,
mine is no different to the others

10:41.057 --> 10:43.218
in the same way that the table is round.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.972
Many of our order are kings and princes
in their own realms,

10:47.063 --> 10:49.395
nonetheless happy to sit
shoulder-to-shoulder

10:49.440 --> 10:51.055
with the rest of their knights.

10:51.151 --> 10:55.394
No one of us above the other,
except for this one.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.656
This is the Siege Perilous.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.778
Reserved for the knight
with the purest heart,

11:01.911 --> 11:05.574
the one destined to carry out
the most sacred quests.

11:05.623 --> 11:09.161
Belonged to a man
I trusted more than a brother,

11:09.252 --> 11:10.913
but he betrayed me.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.586
It's been vacant since.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.746
Lancelot.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.626
Oh, you've heard of him.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.421
Well, all of you are kind of legends.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.501
Really?

11:20.597 --> 11:22.588
I shudder to think what our tale must be.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.474
Oh. Only one of the greatest romances
of all time.

11:26.603 --> 11:30.846
Your love for Guinevere was ripped
away by your best friend, Lancelot.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.811
It's a tragic story
that clearly had a happy ending.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.606
The two of you seem like
all that's in the past now.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.359
Yes. Lancelot was a good man.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.111
The situation was difficult.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.995
I understand. Actually, Snow...
Mary Margaret and I, we met him.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.948
You did? How is he?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.290
I'm very sorry to tell you this,

11:54.339 --> 11:57.627
but we learned that he died.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.885
I'm sorry.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.671
Lancelot failed to resist temptation,
but he was a good knight.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.549
He tortured himself for his sins
far more than I would've done.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.477
I wished him happy.
Just not with my wife.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.594
(DOOR OPENS)

12:16.736 --> 12:18.021
Careful.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.529
This is our reliquary,

12:26.496 --> 12:30.535
containing our sacred
and magical items

12:30.667 --> 12:31.827
our knights have recovered.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.329
I've never seen magic like that.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.004
It's the Unquenchable Flame.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.666
Said to be part
of the burning bush itself.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.754
This will light our path,

12:42.845 --> 12:45.837
and where we're going,
we're gonna need it.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.007
The reliquary, Your Majesty.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.523
So, you are the one
who found this broken into?

12:58.528 --> 12:59.517
Any theories?

12:59.570 --> 13:00.605
Me?

13:02.198 --> 13:05.941
Oh, well, uh, everyone speaks
of the Dark One in this place.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.906
-Perhaps...
-Stop being a fool, man.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.871
Arthur, to be honest,
she did take a dwarf ax.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.075
And as you're about to say,
the Dark One doesn't need tools.

13:15.211 --> 13:19.250
This lock was pried open.
Look, you can see the scratches.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.418
You're right.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.088
This is your land.
What are you thinking?

13:24.220 --> 13:27.132
I'm thinking
I may not know who did this,

13:28.433 --> 13:31.049
but I think I have a good idea
of what their next move will be.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.236
Ah. I know that look.
Button on the top turns it on.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.613
I know how to use a phone.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.278
Yeah. What's that, then?

13:47.410 --> 13:50.072
It's a picture from up inside Zelena.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.444
Whoa, mate.

13:51.581 --> 13:56.166
No, no, it's of the baby.
They... They call it a sonogram.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.586
-Mixed emotions, I bet.
-(SIGHS)

14:02.633 --> 14:05.921
I mean, I know it's painful for Regina,

14:05.970 --> 14:07.756
her evil sister carrying my child.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.636
It's painful for me.

14:09.766 --> 14:14.430
And yet there's some part of me
that can't help but feel happy.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.310
It's my child.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.937
And I sure don't want Regina
to know that.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.474
I don't want her
to misconstrue my happiness for, well...

14:21.611 --> 14:24.478
You got yourself a complex
situation there, that's for sure.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.484
Hmm. Unlike your simple love life.

14:27.617 --> 14:31.280
Huh. About that, she's not the same.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.366
The new house?

14:34.457 --> 14:37.699
There's a door in there that
she doesn't want me anywhere near.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.831
What do you suppose she's hiding?
I was thinking that may...

14:40.963 --> 14:42.214
Order up.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.799
Order? I didn't order anything.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.627
Well, what does it say?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.967
"Meet me on your ship. Emma."

14:52.016 --> 14:55.008
You're right.
Things are complicated all over.

15:13.996 --> 15:14.985
(FLOORBOARD CREAKING)

15:18.835 --> 15:20.666
It's not funny, appearing like that.

15:21.838 --> 15:22.873
Sorry.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.171
What's going on?

15:26.843 --> 15:30.210
I know this has all been really confusing
and I have not made it any easier.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.348
I wanted to apologize
for overreacting last time.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.051
I know you were just trying to help.

15:39.564 --> 15:44.729
So I thought we could just talk
and have lunch, like old times.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.356
I'd like nothing more.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.279
But this is hardly like old times.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.701
Better?

16:00.418 --> 16:01.874
Come on.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.383
You know you can trust me.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.887
DAVID: What is it, noon?

16:18.978 --> 16:22.061
You weren't kidding about eternal night.
I'm glad we have the torch.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.560
ARTHUR: I'm glad we sent Grif home
with the horses.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.065
These woods
would make them restless.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.401
Your squire works hard, Your Majesty.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.146
"And you don't thank him enough,"

16:31.240 --> 16:32.946
I can hear you saying it
even when you don't.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.658
You're right, though.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.328
I don't even have
the excuse of ignorance.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.122
I was born a common man
and have been in service myself.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.159
You weren't born noble?

16:44.795 --> 16:47.787
(CHUCKLES)
I'm as peasant as they come.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.130
-Shepherd?
-Oh.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.416
(DAVID CHUCKLES)

16:51.761 --> 16:53.752
I can feel my backbone
relaxing already.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.925
Let's stop with the "Your Majesties,"
shall we?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.760
Of course. (CHUCKLES)

16:58.851 --> 17:00.307
As for my squire,

17:00.436 --> 17:03.178
I assure you, Guin more than
makes up the difference,

17:03.272 --> 17:05.103
showering him and the others with gifts.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.022
She really is the kindest woman
I've ever met.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.770
Sounds like my wife.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.606
Once she decides you're family,
she'd die for you.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.779
That's not to say
Guin doesn't have her fierce side.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.324
With a bow and arrow, I've seen her
take out the eye of a dove in flight.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.695
Well, Mary Margaret could do that.
She wouldn't. But she could.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.872
We should have a tourney.
Get them to compete.

17:22.959 --> 17:23.948
(LAUGHS) Right.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.284
'Cause I'm sure they'd love
to be pitted against each other

17:26.337 --> 17:27.827
to let us feel good about ourselves.

17:27.964 --> 17:28.953
Here.

17:30.925 --> 17:31.914
(SIGHS)

17:36.514 --> 17:39.130
Yeah, perhaps there are better ways
for me to show off.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.559
You're a competitive man,
for someone with a Round Table.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.012
I thought the idea was
you didn't want to sit above anyone.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.308
Someone who isn't competitive

17:47.358 --> 17:49.644
doesn't need a two-ton table
to remind him to be humble.

17:49.694 --> 17:50.774
(LAUGHS)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.404
I know my weaknesses.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.069
Lancelot and Guinevere
weren't the only ones

17:54.156 --> 17:55.862
to blame for what happened to them.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.528
I was a difficult man to live with.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.742
But I made a conscious decision
to fix things.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.737
I understand that.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.033
This way.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.079
(EXHALES)

18:15.553 --> 18:18.215
Look upon that, brother.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.602
So it is real.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.356
The Crimson Crown.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.531
It will never take both of us.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.575
I'll go.

18:46.876 --> 18:50.289
Well, I'll wait here.
Let the torch be your beacon back.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.413
Thank you.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.912
(PANTING)

19:33.923 --> 19:35.459
DAVID: How's he doing?

19:35.591 --> 19:36.580
Not well.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.007
I'm sorry.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.594
Yeah. But I found a healing spell
in one of his old notebooks.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.015
I've got everything put together
except for one last ingredient.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.767
I need an object that touched him

19:48.854 --> 19:51.937
when he was still a man,
before he became the Dark One.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.264
Well, you must have something.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.849
Yeah, well, nothing I can find.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.310
Well, there is still more
to look through, though.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.697
Well, do you want me
to get you some help?

19:59.281 --> 20:04.321
No. I mean, I'm the only one
who knows this place, knows his things.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.785
And I need to keep doing something.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.037
Well, then we'll make this quick.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.830
Has anyone come in
to pawn anything today?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.119
Especially a magic bean.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.835
Uh, a bean?
No. No one's come in, sorry.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.788
It was worth a shot.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.543
That's all right.
You have something else I need.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.344
May I borrow this?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.009
Yeah, but...

20:26.142 --> 20:29.805
Good. This is gonna point us
right at our culprit.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.969
What is it?

20:31.021 --> 20:32.306
It's not magic, though.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.980
It's just a souvenir
from Doc's birthday party.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.353
It says "Doctober Fest" on it.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.728
I'm very well aware.
Don't worry, I've got this.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.530
Attention, subjects of Camelot!

20:48.664 --> 20:51.406
In my hand, you see
the Chalice of Vengeance.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.661
There's been a theft
in your encampment.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.243
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

20:59.341 --> 21:02.674

to drink from the sacred cup.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.046
-Thank you.
-Think nothing of it.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.054
It would appear you did it. Well done!

24:41.605 --> 24:42.720
KILLIAN: I have questions.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.558
You want to know
if I'm still the same Emma.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.942
I imagine that's not a simple answer,
so let's start easy.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.020
Your new house...

24:51.907 --> 24:53.522
What's behind that locked door?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.284
You know I want to trust you, Emma.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.746
Why don't you help me?

25:02.084 --> 25:03.415
So trust me.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.703
With my powers, I could hide
anything from your prying eyes anyway.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.373
Now you've answered
my first question, too.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.919
You're not the same Emma.
She didn't play games.

25:16.557 --> 25:20.220
(CLEARS THROAT) Yes. I'm different.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.139
I'm better.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.603
As the Dark One?

25:25.399 --> 25:28.391
I used to be scarred and judgmental
and closed off.

25:28.444 --> 25:31.151
Took me forever
to see the magic in this place.

25:33.407 --> 25:34.943
And now I...

25:37.578 --> 25:39.739
I see things clearly.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.238
I'm not scared anymore.

25:44.752 --> 25:48.586
Honestly, I'm an open book
if you're willing to take that trust-step.

25:49.631 --> 25:54.466
Are you really suggesting that
we move fonNard in a real relationship?

25:55.637 --> 25:58.299
Gold and Belle loved each other.

25:59.183 --> 26:02.095
I don't think you should use
the crocodile as your example.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.807
But think about it.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.813
He was born a coward.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.522
He didn't find true love
until he was the Dark One.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.861
You told me how the man he was

26:14.990 --> 26:16.776
groveled and cried
on the deck of this ship.

26:17.993 --> 26:18.982
He changed for the better, too.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.280
You're wrong.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.322
I was the villain
in that little drama, Swan.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.834
He was a good man
trying to keep his family together,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.790
and I took this cutlass

26:30.839 --> 26:33.876
and put it to his head and taunted him.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.878
I was the only one there
who's changed for the better.

26:39.014 --> 26:43.178
He became an evil manipulative killer!

26:45.187 --> 26:46.893
Do you remember
when we were in the storybook

26:47.022 --> 26:48.478
and I taught you how to swordplay?

26:48.524 --> 26:49.855
More games. Enough, Swan!

26:50.859 --> 26:52.690
All I wanted was your honesty.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.403
But I'm done humoring you.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.197
Answer me.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.237
And start by why you brought me here.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.201
And it wasn't because
this is what we used to do,

27:03.330 --> 27:06.868
because that you isn't here.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.839
You need something, Dark One.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.592
Tell me what it is.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.845
All I need is your trust, I promise.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.051
I liked you the way you were.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.766
And I liked your walls.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.106
I liked being the one
to break them down.

27:34.403 --> 27:37.895
And the person you found inside
is still me.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.568
I have a question for you, for once.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.742
Do you love me?

27:48.917 --> 27:52.751
If you tell me you don't love me,
I will let you go.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.462
I loved you.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.766
I guess I'm either steering home
or swimming home.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.932
Tell me which.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.772
The ship's yours.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.453
The toadstool. It's gone!

28:38.634 --> 28:41.842
Either the phantom knights took it
or it was lost in the bog.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.305
Well, we could search for it.

28:45.807 --> 28:46.967
No.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.850
It's gone.

28:59.905 --> 29:04.615
The word "quest" means to seek,
not to find.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.618
It's the seeking that matters.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.994
Do you believe that?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.952
Not truly, no.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.292
If the finding is what makes
a difference in this world,

29:16.338 --> 29:19.000
then that's what I want. I'm sorry.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.130
(LAUGHS)

29:24.012 --> 29:26.344
My father, he drank his life away.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.804
My brother accomplished nothing
but evil.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.340
There was a time
I thought I'd be different.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.687
Change the world.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.687
But I just...

29:39.194 --> 29:41.310
I don't want to only be remembered
as the man

29:41.363 --> 29:44.526
who kissed a sleeping princess awake
30 years ago.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.694
I understand.

29:48.870 --> 29:52.158
-You do? You're king of Camelot.
-(S|GHS)

29:53.125 --> 29:55.992
Yes, some large rock decided
I was a hero.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.375
A prophecy fulfilled. (LAUGHS)

29:58.839 --> 30:03.128
But since then, I've had victories
and I've had losses.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.836
And I've learned that it's the losses
that require us to be brave.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.674
So if anything will make us heroes...

30:08.724 --> 30:12.387
It's the never giving up,
even after a loss.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.471
Indeed.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.148
Well, we might as well get out of here.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.184
There's work to be done,

30:23.238 --> 30:24.398
and it's not here.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.478
Good man.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.905
David, if you want to be
part of something,

30:29.995 --> 30:31.701
do something that matters,

30:31.747 --> 30:34.033
I have a place for a man like you.

30:40.756 --> 30:41.996
I never saw a bean.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.876
Just forget the bean for now.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.177
Just tell us why you took these things.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.423
I was tired of how I was being treated.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.097
How we were all being treated,
breaking our backs for him,

30:56.229 --> 30:57.844
for love of Camelot.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.603
I wanted to hurt the king.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.275
Grif, I had no idea.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.902
But you see, you've hurt everyone.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.451
We need that bean to get home!

31:14.414 --> 31:16.621
I didn't see a bean, Your Majesty.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.373
I'm always betrayed
by those closest to me.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.550
Look, you know this guy. Is he lying?

31:28.637 --> 31:30.593
I don't believe so.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.300
And of course,
it is possible there was no bean,

31:32.432 --> 31:35.595
if it was removed
during the six weeks we can't recall.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.556
Okay. Well, we'll find another way
to get you home.

31:38.647 --> 31:39.636
Working together?

31:40.482 --> 31:41.471
Absolutely.

31:43.652 --> 31:44.812
Let's go tell this guy
he's gonna make his home

31:44.945 --> 31:46.151
in our cell for a little while.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.121
What's this?

31:55.163 --> 31:57.825
It must have fallen out
when we emptied his bag.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.333
If that was in the trunk,
it was added after the time we lost.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.082
I recognize this.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.510
That's the one in the book
from Camelot.

32:13.807 --> 32:16.344
The one I found this morning.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.936
That's what we were
looking for back there.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.271
But why?

32:24.359 --> 32:27.647
It's used to communicate
through magical barriers.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.654
We must've been trying
to communicate with Merlin.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.155
I wonder if we did.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.452
Let's use it. Let's find out
if we can talk to him now.

32:34.536 --> 32:36.777
He can help us save Emma
from being the Dark One.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.371
David, you did it.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.333
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)

I dub thee Sir David

now of the Round Table.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.811
I know "Knight of the Round Table"

33:07.903 --> 33:10.064
is pale fire indeed
next to the title of Prince.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.739
No. I am beyond honored.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.900
Then rise, Sir Knight, take your place.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.326
(ARTHUR CLEARS THROAT)

33:40.894 --> 33:42.009
Really?

33:42.103 --> 33:46.346
I never thought I'd find anyone
I trust enough to fill that seat.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.352
But it's yours.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.202
And it will bear your coat of arms.

34:11.424 --> 34:15.133
-Not bad for a shepherd, eh?
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

34:15.554 --> 34:16.589

34:53.508 --> 34:55.464
Someone there?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.512
It can't be.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.344
It iS.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.682
Lancelot? We thought you were dead.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.519
That is a long story.
But trust your eyes, it is me.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.942
And right now,
my struggles don't matter.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.194
What does is that
there is a terrible villain in Camelot.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.452
The Dark One. We know.
It's our daughter, we're going to fix it.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.154
No.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.373
There's another villain.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.659
Arthur.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.452
-What?
-Trust me.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.209
No, Camelot is not what it seems.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.752
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)

35:51.358 --> 35:53.314
Today was a difficult day.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.701
And it brought me no pleasure.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.994
He's a good man.

36:12.379 --> 36:15.496
A noble man.
But I must think of my kingdom first.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.251
Of course you must.

36:23.390 --> 36:26.348
That is always the burden of a King.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.104
Oh, Your Majesty,
thank goodness you're here.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.107
I don't understand what's going on.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.610
I did only what you asked.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.487
I took the items and I kept them safe.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.738
I said maybe there was a bean,

36:46.830 --> 36:48.695
even though you and I know full well
there was never a bean,

36:48.790 --> 36:50.576
and I did it exactly as you said.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.576
Can you please let me out now?

36:55.672 --> 36:57.162
Not just yet, Grif.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.254
There may not have been a bean,

36:59.342 --> 37:01.719
but we can't have them
learning that now, can we?

37:01.803 --> 37:04.260
No. No, of course not, Your Majesty.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.633
They trust me now.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.932
So I must use that trust
to protect my kingdom.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.430
These people may seem friendly,

37:11.521 --> 37:13.102
but they threaten
everything we hold dear.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.109
David likes to imagine
his quest a noble one.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.523
But his daughter is the Dark One.

37:25.410 --> 37:30.074
They lied to us in Camelot.
They brought her into our castle.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.281
They are responsible
for tearing us away from our home,

37:32.375 --> 37:34.206
a home we must now reclaim.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.918
But how will we ever get back
without a bean?

37:37.005 --> 37:39.121
I'm afraid we cannot get back.

37:41.301 --> 37:45.214
That's why we must build
a new Camelot. Here, in Storybrooke.

37:48.558 --> 37:52.426
Then you can trust me to help.
I would do anything for my kingdom.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.555
I know you would.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.229
As would I.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.479
Which is why I need you to drink this.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.112
Poison from the Agrabah Vipers.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.656
But why?

38:10.747 --> 38:12.738
I won't tell these people a thing.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.867
Not of your own free will,

38:13.958 --> 38:16.165
but they have magic on their side.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.913
In time, they will make you talk.

38:18.505 --> 38:19.790
There must be some other way.

38:19.881 --> 38:23.669
I wish there was. Truly, I do.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.843
You told me you always dreamed
of sitting at the Round Table one day?

38:27.931 --> 38:30.673
Well, now I am offering you
something greater,

38:30.767 --> 38:34.601
a chance to die in service of Camelot.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.938
Your death will be the cornerstone
of a great new Kingdom.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.078
You need me?

39:40.920 --> 39:42.126
Yeah.

39:43.506 --> 39:46.464
Remember how I told you
about that door in Emma's place?

39:46.968 --> 39:48.924
I want to know what's behind it.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.843
I take it asking her didn't work.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.012
She's beyond that. I need a thief.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.799
Former thief.
Those days are behind me.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.226

you're gonna need more than that.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.734
Sit down for some real food.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.152
I can't.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.404
Oh, my God, look.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.951
Yeah, I have to get back to him.
Just forget the soup. I'm sorry.

40:16.039 --> 40:18.200
Hang on, is it supposed to do that?

40:18.291 --> 40:19.406

You know, he doesn't look too good,
if I do say so myself.

40:51.783 --> 40:52.863
Quite a stroke of luck,

40:52.951 --> 40:56.193
you finding something
that touched him when he was a man.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.027
It wasn't luck. I worked hard for this.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.532
That's true.

40:59.624 --> 41:02.832
You crushed Hook's heart
even more firmly under your

41:03.878 --> 41:05.994
impractical boot heel.

41:06.089 --> 41:07.374
Quiet.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.576
What do you want from me?

41:40.206 --> 41:43.664
You are the Dark One now, not me.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.625
That's right. You are not dark,
you are also not light.

41:49.716 --> 41:50.956
You are nothing.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.046
Your heart is a blank slate.

41:54.137 --> 41:57.049
And that, little man, makes you useful.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.347
Because now,

41:59.434 --> 42:02.722
I can make you into the last thing
you ever thought you would be,

42:03.980 --> 42:05.186
a hero.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.354
