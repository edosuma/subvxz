WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:02.269
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.360 --> 00:06.751
In 1955, students at Tree Hill High School

00:06.840 --> 00:10.389
created a time capsule
to be opened in 50 years.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.358
Within the next week, each of you
will videotape your thoughts.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.876
<i>In ten years, I'll probably be married</i>
<i>to someone like Marvin McFadden.</i>

00:16.960 --> 00:19.349
<i>You all probably call him</i>
<i>Senator McFadden.</i>

00:19.440 --> 00:21.476
I bet you're gonna have it all someday.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.154
Yeah, I'm thinking of running for senator.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.709
When I look back on the tour,
I'm not, like, proud of it

00:26.800 --> 00:28.597
'cause I know that you
weren't proud of me.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.829
Is that what you think?

00:30.120 --> 00:32.680
Luke, you mind if we get a few words
before your first game?

00:32.759 --> 00:34.159
Yeah, we're sports announcers.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.629
Jimmy Edwards, my partner and friend!

00:36.720 --> 00:37.755
Marry me.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.635
I have cancer.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.280
I want you to be here
when the album comes out.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.839
I will be here, Peyton.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.989
Ellie!

01:34.480 --> 01:37.040
So you want me to tell you
something about myself?

01:37.960 --> 01:40.030
I don't have anything to say.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.478
Even if I did,
you'd be wrong to believe me.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.599
Trust is a lie.

01:48.920 --> 01:49.989
Nobody ever knows anyone.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.435
<i>You know, people think that if you</i>
<i>love somebody hard enough,</i>

01:57.520 --> 01:59.715
<i>then everything's just gonna work out.</i>

02:00.280 --> 02:01.554
<i>People are wrong.</i>

02:02.000 --> 02:05.037
<i>50 years from now,</i>
<i>I hope you got what you wanted, Haley.</i>

02:05.560 --> 02:08.916
<i>But getting married to you</i>
<i>was the worst mistake of my life.</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:12.671
<i>Here's a little advice.</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:14.992
<i>Never get married.</i>

02:15.480 --> 02:17.550
<i>In the end, you'll only be miserable.</i>

02:18.120 --> 02:20.429
<i>I pretty much dated all the hot girls.</i>

02:20.720 --> 02:22.995
<i>Freshmen, seniors.</i>

02:23.720 --> 02:25.438
<i>Yes, good times.</i>

02:25.720 --> 02:29.156
<i>Currently I'm dating Brooke Davis.</i>

02:29.520 --> 02:31.238
<i>Let's see, what else.</i>

02:31.400 --> 02:33.197
<i>Oh, yeah. There's this new girl Anna...</i>

02:33.280 --> 02:36.590
And to think, I was this close
to cutting school today.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.513
Tim Smith, huh?

02:38.600 --> 02:39.669
Score.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.079
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I was supposed to do with her.</i>

02:41.160 --> 02:42.229
<i>There's all these girls...</i>

02:42.320 --> 02:43.355
<i>She's hype!</i>

02:44.040 --> 02:45.996
You sure it's the time capsule
from last year?

02:46.080 --> 02:47.229
Damn sure.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.311
Somebody uncorked it early.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.434
I don't know, Coach. Looks fine here.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.197
<i>Just getting along is kind of new to us</i>
<i>because it's...</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:00.157
Just shut down the feed.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.916
Once we remove the door,
because whoever did this

03:05.000 --> 03:07.673
- broke the key off in the damn lock.
- I'll call a locksmith.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.876
Maybe you better call out the SWAT team.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.678
This could turn ugly.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.518
<i>But that doesn't change the fact</i>
<i>that I need to get closer to my father.</i>

03:15.600 --> 03:18.068
<i>Because if I can get closer to him,</i>

03:18.160 --> 03:20.196
<i>maybe I can find a way to beat him.</i>

03:21.160 --> 03:22.718
<i>Once and for all.</i>

03:24.640 --> 03:27.074
<i>And set the people that I love free.</i>

03:28.640 --> 03:31.712
<i>I just hope I have the strength</i>
<i>to tear him down for good.</i>

03:39.200 --> 03:42.795
<i>In ten years, I'll probably be married</i>
<i>to someone like Marvin McFadden.</i>

03:42.880 --> 03:44.950
<i>You guys probably call him</i>
<i>Senator McFadden</i>

03:45.040 --> 03:46.598
<i>but we just call him Mouth.</i>

03:46.680 --> 03:49.274
<i>So, if you're watching this in 2055,</i>

03:49.360 --> 03:52.750
<i>there really needs to be some sort</i>
<i>of record of my body at its peak.</i>

03:52.840 --> 03:54.159
Oh, no, wait.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.669
We've to turn this off, right now!

03:58.160 --> 03:59.593
<i>What the hell.</i>

04:00.760 --> 04:01.988
Cut the damn power.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.479
Can somebody do something?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.630
Somebody has to do something.
Excuse me, move.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.754
<i>Now, if you guys are space aliens,</i>
<i>you probably have three of these,</i>

04:09.840 --> 04:12.513
<i>but I haven't gotten any complaints so far.</i>

04:12.600 --> 04:15.194
No, no, no.
There's nothing to see here, people.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.439
- Move!
<i>- What the hell.</i>

04:26.160 --> 04:28.628
<i>Actually, if you're aliens,</i>
<i>you probably have eight sets of eyes</i>

04:28.720 --> 04:30.551
<i>which would mean I'd have 16 boobs,</i>

04:30.640 --> 04:32.949
<i>which would mean my lingerie bill</i>
<i>would go through the roof.</i>

04:33.040 --> 04:35.634
I'm canceling classes
and sending everyone home.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.234
In the meantime, find out who did this.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.996
<i>... regular futuristic kids.</i>
<i>Hoped you enjoyed your retro...</i>

04:42.600 --> 04:45.319
<i>So you wanna know</i>
<i>what things were like 50 years ago?</i>

04:45.400 --> 04:46.992
<i>Well, the truth is,</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:49.316
<i>there's not a single person in this place</i>

04:49.400 --> 04:52.073
<i>worth remembering in 50 years.</i>

04:52.520 --> 04:54.954
<i>So don't believe any</i>
<i>of the other crap you're hearing.</i>

04:55.040 --> 04:57.679
<i>Everyone at Tree Hill High is a liar.</i>

04:57.800 --> 05:01.475
<i>Like I'm sure Russ Lahodnie,</i>
<i>you know, our All-American wrestler,</i>

05:01.560 --> 05:04.677
<i>who everybody thinks</i>
<i>is this nice, respectable guy.</i>

05:05.320 --> 05:06.594
<i>I bet he forgot to mention the fact</i>

05:06.680 --> 05:10.116
<i>that he's the king of slipping girls</i>
<i>the date rape drug.</i>

05:10.200 --> 05:12.714
<i>Or Miss Perfect 4.0 Katie Radison?</i>

05:12.800 --> 05:16.679
<i>Yeah, three words. Gang, bang, abortion.</i>

05:18.600 --> 05:22.639
<i>See, people here are fake,</i>
<i>so they stick to their cliques to hide it.</i>

05:23.080 --> 05:25.196
<i>I mean, the stoners are medicated,</i>

05:25.280 --> 05:27.874
<i>the honor students are afraid,</i>
<i>and the jocks,</i>

05:28.200 --> 05:30.919
<i>well, they're jocks, man.</i>

05:31.160 --> 05:32.593
<i>They'll peak at 17</i>

05:32.680 --> 05:36.992
<i>and their cheerleader girlfriends</i>
<i>will be fat and lonely by 21.</i>

05:37.080 --> 05:38.195
<i>Losers.</i>

05:39.720 --> 05:41.631
<i>Everyone here is a loser.</i>

05:42.640 --> 05:44.198
<i>And the truth is,</i>

05:45.480 --> 05:48.074
<i>every day I have to come to this school,</i>

05:48.520 --> 05:50.954
<i>is one less day I have to come back.</i>

05:51.080 --> 05:54.390
<i>Attention students.</i>
<i>Classes are canceled for the day.</i>

05:54.480 --> 05:57.950
<i>Please exit the school</i>
<i>in a timely and orderly fashion.</i>

05:58.040 --> 05:59.189
<i>That'd be a miracle.</i>

05:59.280 --> 06:01.396
<i>You know, given how bad</i>
<i>the teachers are at Tree Hill High.</i>

06:01.480 --> 06:04.040
<i>They all say they care, but they don't.</i>

06:07.720 --> 06:08.948
Hey! Jim!

06:11.280 --> 06:12.315
Everything okay?

06:12.400 --> 06:15.597
You don't talk to me for a year
and now you wanna be friends again?

06:15.680 --> 06:16.874
We just wanna talk.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.396
Well, forget it.
You just heard everything I have to say.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.794
<i>I mean, there's probably gonna be</i>
<i>some great advances in plastic surgery</i>

06:31.880 --> 06:34.713
<i>but there really needs to be</i>
<i>some sort of record...</i>

06:36.760 --> 06:40.594
Okay, we've got
a good-news, bad-news situation here.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.389
What could be worse
than the whole school seeing your boobs?

06:45.400 --> 06:48.915
<i>Actually, if you're aliens, you'd probably</i>
<i>have eight sets of eyes which means...</i>

06:49.000 --> 06:50.877
The whole world seeing them?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.950
Yeah, whoever decided
to unleash the time capsule

06:54.040 --> 06:56.713
was also nice enough
to upload it onto the web.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.077
Oh, my God! I'm Internet porn?

06:59.160 --> 07:01.754
Some creepy guy
is watching me right now?

07:02.200 --> 07:04.919
Well, I'm guessing that's not all he's doing.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.194
What's the good news?

07:07.280 --> 07:10.317
- You did rank number 23 on LimeWire.
- Really?

07:10.680 --> 07:11.795
<i>So I'm seeing this girl</i>

07:11.880 --> 07:15.555
<i>and our experience levels</i>
<i>are a little different, you know?</i>

07:15.920 --> 07:19.799
<i>Even so, I'm doing something with her</i>
<i>that I've never done before.</i>

07:20.280 --> 07:21.998
<i>I'm falling in love.</i>

07:25.880 --> 07:28.269
I'm sorry, buddy.
I know it's not easy to relive all this.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.588
No, it's okay.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.073
Seriously. I'm not gonna have
a "Jake-down."

07:33.280 --> 07:35.794
Yeah, but hearing you talk
about how in love you guys were...

07:35.880 --> 07:37.393
We were in love,

07:37.560 --> 07:39.152
and it was amazing,

07:40.280 --> 07:43.352
but seeing it and hearing it again
just makes me realize how happy I was.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.510
And you know,
I wanna be that happy again.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.716
I do. So I'm just gonna grow the hell up,

07:47.800 --> 07:50.360
and focus on the good things in my life,

07:51.280 --> 07:54.317
and get ready
for Ellie's benefit concert, right?

07:59.240 --> 08:02.038
- Oh, this is gonna be great.
- I hope so.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.270
Ticket sales haven't exactly
been through the roof.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.113
What are you worried about?
You sold out the last Fall Out Boy show

08:07.200 --> 08:09.077
and this time you have Haley
and Jack's Mannequin and...

08:09.160 --> 08:11.515
And more expensive benefit tickets.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.830
Okay, yes. I mean,
we do have great bands,

08:13.920 --> 08:16.673
and Sunkist is been awesome
by underwriting the whole event

08:16.760 --> 08:18.159
but I just...

08:18.240 --> 08:22.199
I'd really love to do something great
for the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.475
- You know, it's for Ellie.
- Yeah.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.319
Anyway, I just wish there was a way
to get more people's attention.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.753
Too bad I didn't put it on the time capsule,

08:28.840 --> 08:31.195
then everybody would have seen it, right?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.631
How much do you love
that your best friend's a genius...

08:36.120 --> 08:37.188
Never mind.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.238
I know how to get the word out.
I just need to call Mouth, he can help.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.436
And after my whole senator comment
on the time capsule,

08:42.520 --> 08:45.318
he's so thrilled with me I think he'd donate
a kidney, if I asked him to.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.995
Well, yeah, but it's not like it's
the first time you've ever told him that.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.069
What?

08:50.160 --> 08:51.388
Yeah, he mentioned
the whole senator thing

08:51.480 --> 08:53.277
when we went on our Boy Draft date.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.676
But I never told him about it,

08:57.840 --> 08:58.989
so how would he have known?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.638
<i>I wish I could've talked to her about it.</i>

09:00.720 --> 09:03.359
<i>Not to change her mind</i>

09:03.800 --> 09:06.837
<i>or to tell her what to do,</i>

09:09.600 --> 09:11.591
<i>but just to say I love you.</i>

09:12.360 --> 09:13.713
<i>And I'll miss you.</i>

09:15.360 --> 09:17.032
<i>Just to say goodbye.</i>

09:18.160 --> 09:20.151
Great, it's gone global.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.358
Yeah, well, at least now
the whole world knows

09:22.440 --> 09:24.590
all the nice things you said about me

09:24.680 --> 09:28.116
to go along with all the crappy things
that Nathan said about me.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.119
What did he say when you talked to him?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.277
I haven't talked to him yet.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.800
I know.
I just don't wanna pry open old wounds.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.235
Yeah, well, I think
the time capsule did that for you.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.515
It just really sucks 'cause now
I have to get back up on stage

09:41.600 --> 09:42.635
and sing for this benefit.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.349
It's, like, the worst possible time
for all this stuff to blow up again.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.710
What'd you say to Hooter Girl
when she made her topless debut?

09:54.080 --> 09:57.117
- I told her she looked beautiful.
- Oh, gosh.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.077
Hey, you know what?
If you get into trouble,

09:59.160 --> 10:02.391
- just roll that one out.
- Yeah, I'll remember that. Thanks.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.234
Lucas, can we talk to you?

10:06.160 --> 10:07.354
Why?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.193
Keith and I have been
doing some talking and...

10:10.640 --> 10:12.915
- We're engaged.
- What?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.352
That's so awesome!

10:15.440 --> 10:16.634
- Well, it's about time!
- Oh, my God!

10:16.720 --> 10:18.711
Oh, my God, you guys are really engaged.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.392
That's so awesome!

10:20.480 --> 10:23.711
<i>Here's a little advice. Never get married.</i>

10:24.280 --> 10:26.430
<i>In the end, you'll only be miserable.</i>

10:39.560 --> 10:40.549
Hi.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.559
- Listen, about the time capsule...
- You looked beautiful.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.716
Okay, I guess you had to be there. Sorry.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.879
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
for avoiding you.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.393
Avoiding this.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.828
I just really don't wanna ruin
how we've been lately with another fight.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.549
I know.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.996
And look, I'm sorry about
what I said on that stupid time capsule.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.036
And you weren't supposed to hear that.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.997
I mean, this you
wasn't supposed to hear that.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.548
Not when things have been
going so good for us, you know.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.757
Yeah. Okay, so this is the thing,

11:15.160 --> 11:17.993
we've had some
really great nights together lately.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.479
Really great.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.552
But you're still living alone
in this big house

11:21.640 --> 11:23.870
and I'm still crammed
in a one-bedroom with Brooke,

11:23.960 --> 11:25.518
and I just...

11:27.920 --> 11:29.797
I don't know. I don't...

11:31.160 --> 11:34.197
Maybe we're not doing
as good as we think we are.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.834
Since you're the head of the Media Club,

11:40.640 --> 11:44.030
being as you're the President
of the Student Council

11:44.320 --> 11:46.550
and all around social butterfly,

11:47.520 --> 11:51.149
I thought the two of you might know
who caused all this mess.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.108
No idea, Coach.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.078
Classes check out the keys
to the media closet all the time.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.675
- Anybody could have done it.
- How about you, Miss Davis? Any ideas?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.109
Can't think of anybody right now.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.315
I mean, what kind of horrible person
would pry open people's secrets

12:13.400 --> 12:15.550
by opening up the time capsule?

12:16.320 --> 12:17.355
Yeah.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.709
Yeah.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.072
Hey, Peyton told me you're planning
on running for senator.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.037
I think it's a good fit.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.789
Since most politicians are liars.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.676
Is it too late for my mom
to get engaged to a plumber?

12:39.200 --> 12:41.316
Better watch your smart remarks, pal.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.358
I think the engagement comes
with full grounding privileges.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.398
Good to remember.
But seriously, you don't have to fix this.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.278
The disposal's been broke for over a year.
We're kind of used to it.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.954
Yeah, well, it's never too late to try
and fix things.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.432
So why don't you come down here
and give me a hand

12:56.520 --> 12:57.794
and tell me what's bothering you?

12:57.880 --> 12:58.995
Well,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.111
- you remember Jimmy Edwards?
- Thanks.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.474
Yeah. Why?

13:03.720 --> 13:06.553
You know how
the time capsule thing got out?

13:06.920 --> 13:09.992
It's just his entry was really dark.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.395
You know, he...

13:11.480 --> 13:13.869
He was just a completely different person.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.158
He just ranted about
how much he hates everybody.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.798
Doesn't sound like the happy-go-lucky kid

13:18.880 --> 13:21.952
who used to come to the auto shop
and quiz me on sports trivia.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.190
What do you think made him
say those things?

13:24.280 --> 13:25.349
Me.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.235
Maybe, I...

13:27.840 --> 13:31.230
I haven't seen him since I
joined the basketball team.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.629
You know, we just kind of drifted apart.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.593
There, you see?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.429
It's never too late to try and fix things.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.113
Speaking of...

13:48.480 --> 13:50.152
I got a little proposition for you.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.356
It's kind of off the subject,

13:53.080 --> 13:55.389
but I want you to understand

13:55.480 --> 13:58.552
that there is no wrong answer
to this question, okay?

13:58.640 --> 13:59.675
Okay.

14:00.680 --> 14:01.795
Okay, well...

14:04.040 --> 14:07.715
- Well, you know I love you...
- Okay, Keith, I know that.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.194
What's up?

14:10.120 --> 14:13.795
Well, me and your mom talked it over,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.910
and, well, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to adopt you.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.717
I want you to be my son.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.916
Well, you just sit with it for a while
and we'll talk about it later, okay?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.433
And remember,

14:31.400 --> 14:33.311
there is no wrong answer.

14:34.920 --> 14:35.955
Okay.

14:43.240 --> 14:47.677
Okay, P. Sawyer, all of your concert woes
are so one-trip-to-Kinko's ago.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.079
Oh, what are you talking about?

14:49.160 --> 14:51.674
Are you planning on hand delivering me
a sold-out crowd?

14:51.760 --> 14:55.230
Sort of. But it's not gonna be
my hands that deliver them.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.715
Brooke? You did all of this?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.599
Me and a couple of horny freshmen.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.353
I never thought I'd be able to say this,
but by the end of the day,

15:08.440 --> 15:10.271
the whole town will have seen my breasts.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.794
Now my mom and I
have something in common.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.758
Have I told you lately,
you're my best friend?

15:33.120 --> 15:34.997
What do you want, Danny?

15:35.480 --> 15:37.198
Let's go for a drive.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.874
What are you doing?

15:39.960 --> 15:42.554
Gonna see if you brought along
a hacksaw and shovel.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.718
There was a time
you and I could talk, Keith.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.997
Yeah, I think the last
meaningful conversation we had was,

15:49.080 --> 15:52.197
"Who would win in a fight?
Chewbacca or the Six Million Dollar Man?"

15:52.280 --> 15:54.111
Chewbacca. Let's go.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.553
I'm telling you, he'll be here.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.198
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.677
Sneaking up on us, Jim?

16:16.960 --> 16:19.713
Not hard to do
when you're basically invisible.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.075
- Look, man, I'm glad you came.
- Well, I almost didn't come,

16:23.160 --> 16:26.755
but I figured it was the only way
to get you to stop calling my house.

16:26.840 --> 16:31.038
I mean, you don't call for a year,
and then suddenly it's five times in a day.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.992
What's up with that?

16:33.280 --> 16:36.590
Look, it sucks that we lost touch, okay?

16:36.680 --> 16:39.990
And a lot of that's on us.
But it is a two-way street.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.395
You know, our phones didn't ring, either.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.309
Wow.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.154
I forgot how much fun this was.
I'm sorry I came.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.515
- Come on, Jimmy.
- He speaks.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.908
What do you got, Mouth?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.958
What words are gonna make up
for a year of being left behind?

16:56.040 --> 16:57.598
A year of being forgotten about?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.552
How about, "I'm sorry."

17:01.640 --> 17:03.358
It sucks, but it's a start.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.192
Look, Jim, you want a long,
drawn out explanation

17:05.280 --> 17:06.952
for why things went down
the way they did,

17:07.040 --> 17:08.951
I can probably find one for you, okay.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.679
But we're here now, you know.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.588
We wanna make up for lost time.
We don't wanna lose anymore.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.191
There's a concert tonight.
This cancer benefit thing.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.031
We want you to come with us.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.429
I can't show my face around those people.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.036
Not after the way
I went off on the time capsule.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.758
Dude, everybody went off.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.990
Some even took things off.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.231
Look, you know what, Mouth's right, man.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.912
They're not worried about what you said,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.468
they're worried about what they said.
Come on.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.198
Look, just say yes.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.638
- Whatever, but if it's lame, I'm leaving.
- All right.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.359
Come on, man.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.230
All right,
so what are we doing here, Danny?

17:57.320 --> 17:59.675
Do you remember what happened here
when we were kids?

18:00.880 --> 18:04.668
Well, I remember I got to first base

18:04.760 --> 18:07.479
with Abby Hosford
underneath that tree over there.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.711
I was thinking a little further back.
I'll give you a hint.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.118
The Dunlap brothers.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.438
Danny Scott's lunch.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.434
No wonder you fight like a girl.
Your mom sure feeds you like one.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.158
Now eat it, Daniella.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.356
Eat it, or we'll make you eat it.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.354
You first!

18:35.480 --> 18:37.630
That's what I thought. Come on.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.154
Thanks.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.150
That's what brothers do.
They look out for each other.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.715
It's like those guys
read a handbook on bullying.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.075
Picking fights, stealing lunches.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.278
But you stood them down
right here in this park,

18:56.360 --> 18:57.679
every other time they got into it.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.797
Yeah, and then you got bigger
than all of us, didn't you?

19:01.480 --> 19:05.632
Back then I knew, no matter what,
you and I would always stick together.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.794
Yeah, well,
that was a long time ago, Danny.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.629
I know.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.429
Look how far things have fallen for us.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.877
What do you think makes two brothers
become such bitter enemies?

19:21.360 --> 19:22.395
You?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.517
You're probably right.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.399
I'll tell you what.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.231
Let me make it up to you.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.432
What is this, Dan?

19:38.880 --> 19:41.553
This is how far things have come
between you and me.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.074
I put that ledger in the safe
before the dealership burned.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.709
Only two things came out of that fire.
That ledger and me.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.791
And I know you didn't pull me out.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.757
I guess you had your hands full
with the ledger.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.274
Well, one anyway,
since the other was holding onto a Zippo.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.999
- Is that what you think?
- No, big brother,

19:57.080 --> 19:58.718
that's what I know.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.434
You're holding onto the smoking gun.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.673
Well, don't forget what this is, Danny.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.435
This is the key to your jail cell.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.273
This ties you to years
of money laundering,

20:11.760 --> 20:13.637
fraud and embezzlement.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.355
You see, that's the thing
about a smoking gun, Dan,

20:16.440 --> 20:18.908
it doesn't care who it's pointing at.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.593
Look at you.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.550
Still carrying around all this hate.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.029
Just like you've been
carrying around this ledger.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.509
Well, if you don't wanna go to jail,

20:31.560 --> 20:33.790
you better get rid of them both.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.717
I'm marrying Karen, Dan.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.473
I'm moving on.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.679
You should, too.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.236
I'll find my own way home.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.434
Get out!

21:02.880 --> 21:05.917
- This is my club.
- You and Keith are engaged?

21:06.120 --> 21:07.553
Wait, are you pregnant? No, of course not.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.232
I mean, being pregnant
twice outside of marriage

21:09.320 --> 21:11.595
would make you totally awesome!

21:12.000 --> 21:14.798
I think that's Brooke
for, "Congratulations."

21:15.280 --> 21:16.838
I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.434
Oh, God! You have to let me
make your wedding dress.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.590
Please? Please, please, please.
I love weddings.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.989
Yeah. Just promise me
that it'll be something more

21:24.080 --> 21:25.638
- than what you're wearing on the poster.
- Yes.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.438
- And no feathers.
- No.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.111
- Hey.
- How you holding up?

21:39.560 --> 21:42.996
- I'm good. Just a few butterflies.
- Good.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.788
Actually, when I say "butterflies,"
I mean, like, giant things

21:45.880 --> 21:48.872
the size of Mothra
or whatever Godzilla fought.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.518
You'll be okay.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.990
I got you these. Good luck.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.835
You know, we should find out
what those flowers are called

21:56.920 --> 21:58.592
- and order some seeds or something.
- Yeah.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.797
At the rate I've been screwing up,
there's not gonna be any left to pick.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.314
Come here.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.317
I'm so proud of you. And I love you.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.554
You're gonna be great out there, okay?
You got nothing to worry about.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.074
Except us.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.871
<i>Hey, what's up, Tree Hill?</i>
<i>How are you guys?</i>

22:32.960 --> 22:36.396
<i>First off, I really want to thank you guys</i>
<i>for coming out tonight.</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:40.314
<i>Some of you may know, Ellie Harp</i>
<i>recently succumbed to breast cancer.</i>

22:40.400 --> 22:44.029
<i>So tonight, we remember her life</i>
<i>by trying to save many lives</i>

22:44.120 --> 22:46.759
<i>because for every ticket</i>
<i>you guys have purchased,</i>

22:46.840 --> 22:49.274
<i>you all are helping the</i>
<i>National Breast Cancer Foundation</i>

22:49.360 --> 22:52.636
<i>in their fight against cancer.</i>
<i>So give it up for yourselves.</i>

22:53.320 --> 22:56.073
<i>Thank you! And also give it up for Sunkist</i>

22:56.160 --> 22:58.390
<i>who helped make all this happen tonight!</i>

22:59.360 --> 23:03.194
<i>All right. Now, you guys,</i>
<i>this next performer had leukemia,</i>

23:03.360 --> 23:06.238
<i>he fought leukemia,</i>
<i>and he kicked leukemia 's ass.</i>

23:06.320 --> 23:08.151
<i>And tonight, he is here to kick yours.</i>

23:08.240 --> 23:11.676
<i>Please give it up for Andrew McMahon</i>
<i>and Jack's Mannequin!</i>

24:38.880 --> 24:42.236
You did good, Peyton.
Both your moms would be proud of you.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.678
Wow. Backstage.
How great is this, man, huh?

25:19.320 --> 25:20.912
Look, I'm gonna go see
if I can find Haley, okay?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.399
- Okay.
- All right.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.479
This is cool.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.597
Hey, I need to talk to Brooke
for a second, okay?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.991
- You sure?
- Yeah, man, go.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.354
All right.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.190
I'm sure you'll introduce me later.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.031
Brooke, you can't possibly think
I could release the time capsule.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.872
That I'd smash out the cornerstone?

25:45.960 --> 25:48.428
Maybe you pretended
it was my windshield.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.794
All right, here's the thing.

25:49.880 --> 25:53.270
Yes, I saw the time capsule
before it was broadcast all over school.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.715
But I was only trying to do it
to help someone out.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.836
Someone who wanted
to erase something they'd said on it.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.638
- Who?
- I can't say.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.709
I swore I'd keep it a secret.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.995
And the time capsule
wasn't supposed to be a secret?

26:03.080 --> 26:04.832
- Brooke, I made a promise.
- Okay,

26:04.920 --> 26:07.753
let's say you did just go in
to try to save somebody

26:07.840 --> 26:09.239
from something they said.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.788
What does that have to do
with my recording?

26:11.880 --> 26:14.440
Why did you have to watch
my time capsule?

26:16.840 --> 26:18.034
That's what I thought.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.157
Brooke, I didn't watch enough of it
to know that you took your clothes off.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.913
- I didn't see anything.
- You think that's what I'm upset about?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.468
Mouth, there were private things on there.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.391
You violated a trust.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.951
You violated a friendship.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.236
I guess I was wrong about
what I said on the time capsule.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.993
You're not the guy
I thought you'd be in 20 years.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.914
Oh, my God!

26:49.280 --> 26:51.111
Did you just get backstage?

26:51.240 --> 26:53.037
Who's all back there? Oh, my God.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.315
Do you think you could get me in?

26:55.400 --> 26:58.597
- I don't know. I could try.
- Hey, don't talk to him.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.478
That's the guy that was talking all
that smack about me on the time capsule.

27:03.560 --> 27:05.755
Look, Russ, I'm really sorry...

27:27.280 --> 27:28.269
Hey!

27:37.680 --> 27:39.033
Break it up! Come on!

27:48.480 --> 27:50.072
Are you all right?

27:50.840 --> 27:52.319
Leave me alone!

27:53.640 --> 27:55.392
Just forget about it.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.672
And forget about me.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.948
You know who's up next?

28:25.040 --> 28:27.429
- Fall Out Boy.
- Yeah, I heard that band sucks.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.636
The bass player's pretty cool.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.028
Hi, Pete.

28:31.480 --> 28:33.869
Hey, I can't thank you
and the band enough for being here.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.598
It's no big deal, but thanks.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.398
And we wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.677
You know, it's a great cause
and I get to see you again.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.195
- Yeah.
- So, be right back.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.157
I'm gonna go save the world.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.236
Did he just roll
"I gotta go save the world?"

28:51.320 --> 28:53.072
- Yeah.
- That's my line.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.236
<i>What's up, Tree Hill? We're Fall Out Boy.</i>

28:58.320 --> 29:01.357
<i>We love your breasts</i>
<i>so make sure you take care of them.</i>

29:52.080 --> 29:54.275
- Hey, Brooke.
- Don't "Hey, Brooke" me.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.351
What is up with you and Hottie McHottie?

29:56.440 --> 30:00.149
- Who McWhat?
- Don't even try it. Please, the Fall Out Boy?

30:00.560 --> 30:02.312
I can spot hitting on you from a mile away

30:02.400 --> 30:04.197
and you were definitely returning fire.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.352
- We talked for like 10 seconds.
- So you move fast.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.913
You should ask him
to check you for lumps.

30:09.000 --> 30:09.989
Okay. Not funny.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.833
What? He's a musician.
He's gotta have good hands.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.475
Great.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.469
Damn it.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.439
You're the one
with the pepper spray, right?

30:41.160 --> 30:42.991
Thanks for helping me out.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.953
To be honest, it really wasn't about you.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.600
I've just always wanted
to pepper spray someone.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.952
Took one to the jaw, huh?

30:59.200 --> 31:01.395
Yeah, it wasn't one. It was three.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.229
- Any idea where Edwards went?
- No, I'm gonna see if I can find him.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.390
- I'll come with you.
- No, let me go alone.

31:09.480 --> 31:12.119
- Might be better, one-on-one.
- All right.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.352
Think we'll ever have a function in this
town that doesn't end up in a brawl?

31:17.440 --> 31:20.034
Why?
Getting a little too <i>Outsiders</i> for you?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.109
I never saw it.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.794
Well, you would have been
one of the bad guys.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.074
Oh, yeah.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.799
We're cool.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.469
All right.

31:33.880 --> 31:34.949
See you.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.395
Haley?

31:45.720 --> 31:48.109
Oh, hey. Under here.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.595
What the hell are you doing?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.271
You know, just hanging out
under the vanity,

31:52.480 --> 31:54.516
singing the finale to <i>Les Mis.</i>

31:54.560 --> 31:56.391
Right before the first time
I had to play on tour,

31:57.440 --> 31:59.795
I got really nervous
and so I ended up hiding under a desk

31:59.360 --> 32:01.316
and I just sang that song
over and over again.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.758
It was kind of the only thing
that would calm me down, so I...

32:03.840 --> 32:05.353
What? You don't have any
pre-game rituals?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.552
No. What are you worried about?

32:08.480 --> 32:09.913
I mean, you got
the home court advantage.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.832
You've played in front of
this many people before.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.593
I know. I'm not worried about
playing in front of hundreds of people.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.271
That I can do in my sleep.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.909
I'm scared of playing
in front of one in particular.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.354
This is my first time
playing out since the tour,

32:25.000 --> 32:28.629
and it's my first time playing
since you and I have been us again.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.114
And I saw your time capsule
and I just got scared.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.435
Of what?

32:33.920 --> 32:37.276
Loving it again.
Of you seeing me love it again. I just,

32:36.080 --> 32:40.232
I'm afraid that you're gonna think that
it somehow means that I love you less.

32:39.920 --> 32:43.151
- They're ready for you, Miss Scott.
- Thanks. Mrs. Scott.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.838
Oh. Sorry.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.433
Well, that was my cue.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.996
Don't be afraid to love it, Haley.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.350
- All right?
- Okay.

33:03.120 --> 33:06.078
- Hey.
- Sorry. Pre-game ritual.

33:06.640 --> 33:07.959
Yeah, I bet.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.557
- Great song, huh?
- Yeah.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.235
You're Haley's husband right?

34:41.719 --> 34:44.438
- Yeah.
- I'm Dallas. Epic records.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.518
She's talented.

34:47.560 --> 34:51.109
I gotta be honest, though.
It's a shame she's not touring.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.871
She must really love you.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.670
Mom, Keith. You got a second?

35:10.320 --> 35:11.389
Sure.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.708
Or, should I say Mom and Dad?

35:15.120 --> 35:17.156
I would love to be your son, Keith.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.190
There's nothing else I'd want more.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.197
Hey, Jimmy, I'm trying to find you.
Where are you?

35:44.560 --> 35:46.516
Call me when you get this.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.353
- Are you coming back in?
- I gotta find my friend.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.269
Why?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.354
Because he's my friend.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.917
You know, Mouth, that guy's either
gonna stand on his own two feet,

35:58.160 --> 36:01.277
or he's gonna fall.
But he has to do it on his own.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.271
That's the scary truth, Mouth.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.033
We're all alone.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.114
- Not if we have friends.
- But he doesn't.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.509
And if you're honest with yourself,

36:13.200 --> 36:15.794
you know there's a reason
you don't hang out with him anymore.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.193
- And why is that?
- Because you're hanging out with me.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.997
Or Brooke. Or Lucas.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.791
Everybody can't be popular.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.198
Because if they were,
nobody would be popular.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.073
I wish this time capsule
had never been opened.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.835
All it's done is cause people pain.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.231
The truth usually does.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.316
- How awesome was my girl?
- Hey!

36:43.560 --> 36:44.709
Thanks.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.679
- What?
- Look, I have a confession to make.

36:51.480 --> 36:52.799
I'm scared.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.839
I didn't want to say anything to you

36:57.440 --> 36:58.953
because I know how much
this means to you,

36:58.840 --> 37:01.115
and you deserve to have nights like this,

37:00.440 --> 37:03.193
but the truth is, I'm afraid
to go through all of it again.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.755
Nathan, I can walk away
from the music, you know, it's...

37:07.320 --> 37:09.959
No, it's not the music, Hales. The rest of it.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.478
I'm afraid to be vulnerable again with you.

37:13.080 --> 37:15.150
Look, I just don't want to be the guy
on that time capsule.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.669
Not now, and not 50 years from now.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.477
Hey, it doesn't mean that I don't love you.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.479
Because I do.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.830
You know,
if I had recorded a time capsule,

37:34.680 --> 37:37.114
there wouldn't have been
one word in there about music.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.036
It all would've been about us.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.953
I'm sure of it.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.989
Just like I'm sure that I love you.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.309
And I guess,

37:46.720 --> 37:49.109
the rest we could figure out later.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.073
They need you for the encore, Mrs. Scott.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.429
Okay.

38:00.920 --> 38:04.390
Just promise me that this time,
you'll be here when I get back.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.989
<i>It's been 50 years,</i>

38:24.080 --> 38:26.071
<i>50 long years,</i>

38:27.600 --> 38:29.079
<i>since I've done this.</i>

38:30.800 --> 38:33.758
<i>Looking back on what I said</i>
<i>all those years ago,</i>

38:34.120 --> 38:36.111
<i>all the hopes and dreams I had,</i>

38:37.160 --> 38:39.390
<i>I've come to the conclusion that</i>

38:41.080 --> 38:44.231
<i>if having things turn out</i>
<i>the way you wanted them to</i>

38:43.840 --> 38:46.149
<i>is a measure of a successful life,</i>

38:47.440 --> 38:49.829
<i>then some would say I'm a failure.</i>

38:51.760 --> 38:53.273
<i>The important thing is</i>

38:58.720 --> 39:01.678
<i>not to be bitter</i>
<i>over life's disappointments.</i>

39:02.080 --> 39:04.719
<i>Learn to let go of the past,</i>

39:08.240 --> 39:12.233
<i>and recognize that</i>
<i>every day won't be sunny.</i>

39:24.640 --> 39:28.519
<i>And when you find yourself</i>
<i>lost in the darkness of despair,</i>

39:29.240 --> 39:32.789
<i>remember, it's only in the black of night</i>

39:50.880 --> 39:52.632
<i>that you can see the stars,</i>

39:54.520 --> 39:57.796
<i>and those stars will lead you back home.</i>

39:57.240 --> 40:01.199
<i>So don't be afraid to make mistakes,</i>
<i>to stumble and fall.</i>

40:02.360 --> 40:04.237
<i>'Cause most of the time,</i>

40:06.400 --> 40:08.834
<i>the greatest rewards</i>
<i>come from doing the things</i>

40:08.600 --> 40:10.477
<i>that scare you the most.</i>

40:11.120 --> 40:13.680
<i>Maybe you'll get everything you wish for.</i>

40:16.440 --> 40:19.955
<i>Maybe you'll get more</i>
<i>than you ever could have imagined.</i>

40:22.800 --> 40:25.109
<i>Who knows where life will take you?</i>

40:30.680 --> 40:33.069
<i>The road is long, and in the end,</i>

40:33.080 --> 40:35.674
<i>the journey is the destination.</i>
