PAPERWORK.
ENTIRELY CONFIDENTIAL.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.291
- IT'S NONE
OF THEIR BUSINESS.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.208
- IT'S DEPARTMENT POLICY
FOR GOOD REASON.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.709
WE WILL CATCH THESE KILLERS,

11:58.709 --> 12:01.125
AND A DEFENSE ATTORNEY
COULD USE THE DETAILS

12:01.125 --> 12:02.917
OF AN OFF-THE-BOOKS ROMANCE
BETWEEN US

12:02.917 --> 12:05.250
TO SENSATIONALIZE THE CASE,
DISTRACT THE JURY--

12:05.250 --> 12:09.375
- IF THEY FIND OUT.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.417
- ON A DEATH PENALTY CASE.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.333
- OKAY,
THEY WILL FIND OUT.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.542
BUT NOT FOR A WHILE.

12:15.542 --> 12:18.375
AND WHAT WOULD WE EVEN
REPORT TO THE BRASS?

12:18.375 --> 12:19.417
- WELL, THAT WE'RE
SEEING EACH OTHER.

12:19.417 --> 12:24.667
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:24.667 --> 12:26.208
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT MEANS?

12:26.208 --> 12:29.041
- IT MEANS IT'S NEW.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.709
WE'RE STILL FIGURING IT OUT.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.667
- SO THIS COULD JUST BE
A PASSING THING.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.250
- NO, IT'S NOT
A PASSING THING.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.375
- THEN WHAT IS IT?

12:40.250 --> 12:41.750
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.667
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
EITHER.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.500
- I'M CONFUSED.
- YEAH.

12:46.500 --> 12:51.083
I CAN SEE THAT.

12:51.083 --> 12:55.875
- CAN WE JUST...WAIT?

12:55.875 --> 12:58.917
- FINE.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.709
- AS A COP, ZOEY HAS BEEN
TO PLENTY OF CRIME SCENES.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.834
SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHOULD BE THERE.

13:15.834 --> 13:18.125
AND WHAT SHOULDN'T.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.709
NO PRINTS
IN THE BLOOD ON THE DOOR,

13:20.709 --> 13:25.250
WHICH MEANS
SHE WORE GLOVES.

13:28.583 --> 13:31.375
SHE WAS STILL WEARING GLOVES
WHEN SHE SHOT HERSELF.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.709
BUT THEY WERE GONE WHEN
THE EMTs ARRIVED.

13:33.709 --> 13:36.709
WHERE'D YOU LEAVE
THOSE GLOVES, ZOEY?

13:36.709 --> 13:42.250
- EASIER TO THINK HERE,
ISN'T IT?

13:42.250 --> 13:44.917
ONLY 52 HOURS
OF FREEDOM LEFT.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.625
YOU SURE CHOSE AN INTERESTING
PERSON TO SPEND IT ON.

13:47.625 --> 13:48.750
- DON'T READ
ANYTHING INTO IT.

13:48.750 --> 13:52.458
ZOEY WAS A CHALLENGE,
THAT'S ALL.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.417
- A WOMAN WHO WIPED OUT
HER OWN FAMILY

13:53.417 --> 13:57.166
IN ORDER TO BE FREE.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.625
- SHE SHOULD HAVE
SHOT HERSELF

13:58.625 --> 14:01.166
INSTEAD OF
HER HUSBAND AND CHILD.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.458
- YEAH...EXCEPT THAT DOESN'T
GET HER FREE.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.000
JUST DEAD.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.125
- WELL,
SHE HAD OTHER OPTIONS.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.917
- ALIMONY.
VISITATION.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.667
TRADING OFF HOLIDAYS--
THERE GO YOUR WEEKENDS.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.166
- FINE, SHE COULD HAVE
MOVED AWAY.

14:16.166 --> 14:19.333
- AND FORFEIT HER JOB,
HER HOME?

14:19.333 --> 14:22.000
HER ONLY OPTION WAS TO MAKE
HER VACATION FROM HER FAMILY

14:22.000 --> 14:23.625
AS PERMANENT AS POSSIBLE.

14:23.625 --> 14:28.500
- THERE ARE
ALWAYS ALTERNATIVES.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.834
- WHY DO YOU THINK
TRINITY'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL?

14:30.834 --> 14:33.834
- HE TRAVELS A LOT.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.291
STAYS ON THE MOVE.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.375
- HE DOESN'T HAVE A FAMILY.

14:38.375 --> 14:41.166
- WELL, I DO.

14:41.166 --> 14:46.000
- MISS THEM YET?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.375
- ALL RIGHT,
TRINITY USED A HAMMER

14:48.375 --> 14:49.542
IN PORTLAND
AND IN FRESNO,

14:49.542 --> 14:54.041
BUT WASN'T IT A TIRE IRON
IN ALBUQUERQUE?

14:56.500 --> 14:58.917
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

14:58.917 --> 15:02.041
WE'LL GO WITH THE DUDE THAT
WAS PULVERIZED BY THE HAMMER.

15:02.041 --> 15:05.625
WHERE WAS THAT?

15:05.625 --> 15:07.709
OKAY, WHAT TIME TOMORROW?

15:07.709 --> 15:11.875
GREAT.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.875
PAD THAI, MY FAVORITE.
- MMM.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.125
HOW'S FRANK LUNDY?

15:16.125 --> 15:17.542
- I DIDN'T SAY
THAT WAS LUNDY.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.667
- OH, YOUR VOICE DID.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.041
IT GOES UP A NOTCH EVERY TIME
YOU TALK TO HIM,

15:21.041 --> 15:23.333
WHICH YOU'RE DOING
A LOT OF LATELY.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.458
- YOUR POINT?

15:25.458 --> 15:28.583
- I GET A GIG IN TOWN
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU.

15:28.583 --> 15:32.750
YOU SPEND ALL YOUR TIME
WITH YOUR EX.

15:32.750 --> 15:36.083
- OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

15:45.917 --> 15:49.750
- YOU TWIST YOUR HAIR
WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM?

15:49.750 --> 15:51.208
- YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE JEALOUS OF

15:51.208 --> 15:53.250
WHEN IT COMES
TO FRANK LUNDY.

15:53.250 --> 15:56.959
ALL RIGHT?

16:05.792 --> 16:08.583
- POKER NIGHT AT HOME.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.625
ZOEY'S POLICE FAMILY
SURROUNDS HER

16:10.625 --> 16:12.709
ON AND OFF THE JOB.

16:12.709 --> 16:15.041
BETWEEN HER BUDDY SYSTEM
AND HER SECURITY SYSTEM,

16:15.041 --> 16:19.458
HER HOUSE WILL BE DIFFICULT
TO BREAK IN TONIGHT.

16:19.458 --> 16:22.458
BUT NOT TOMORROW.

16:40.375 --> 16:46.000
- [whistles]

16:54.333 --> 16:57.208
- [belches]

17:03.250 --> 17:06.125
- CUNT.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.000
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU JUST SAY?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.125
- YOU'RE A CUNT!

17:10.125 --> 17:11.917
- [laughs]

17:11.917 --> 17:13.625
FUCK OFF, OLD MAN.

17:13.625 --> 17:17.208
- FUCKING PUSSY.

17:18.834 --> 17:22.125
[groans]

17:22.125 --> 17:26.375
- YOU LOOKING TO GET
THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF YOU?

17:26.375 --> 17:29.208
- [whimpers]
FAGGOT!

17:29.208 --> 17:32.959
[whimpers]

17:32.959 --> 17:35.709
- YOU GONNA SHUT UP NOW?

17:35.709 --> 17:37.083
- FAGGOT.

17:37.083 --> 17:41.542
FAGGOT.
[grunts]

17:41.542 --> 17:45.041
[moans]

17:48.875 --> 17:51.875
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.709
- THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

17:53.709 --> 17:58.375
- ALL YOUR FAULT.

17:58.375 --> 18:01.709
[coughs]

18:05.083 --> 18:07.083
- THE LIVING ROOM IS HERE
TO THE LEFT,

18:07.083 --> 18:08.291
KITCHEN IN THE BACK,

18:08.291 --> 18:11.709
AND WAY OUT BACK
IS THE HOT TUB.

18:11.709 --> 18:14.250
OH, WELCOME, WELCOME,
WELCOME.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.667
OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
THIS HOUSE.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.250
[laughs]

18:18.250 --> 18:21.291
NEWER CONSTRUCTION,
ONLY ONE PREVIOUS OWNER,

18:21.291 --> 18:23.291
ALL SORTS OF UPGRADES.

18:23.291 --> 18:26.250
COME ON, LET ME SHOW YOU
ITS SPECIAL WONDERS.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.083
- UH, WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT

18:28.083 --> 18:30.458
IF I DISCOVERED THOSE
SPECIAL WONDERS ON MY OWN?

18:30.458 --> 18:32.583
- ANY QUESTIONS,
JUST HOLLER.

18:32.583 --> 18:36.000
- OKAY.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.917
I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.792
WHERE DID ZOEY
STASH HER GLOVES?

18:39.792 --> 18:41.125
I'M SURE
THEY'RE LONG GONE,

18:41.125 --> 18:45.041
BUT THEY COULD HAVE LEFT
TRACE EVIDENCE.

18:45.041 --> 18:50.458
SHE SWIPED THE DOOR
WITH BLOOD HERE...

18:50.458 --> 18:53.959
SHOOTS HERSELF,
COLLAPSES...

18:53.959 --> 18:58.417
CRAWLS TOWARD THE KITCHEN
TO CALL 911.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.583
DID SHE BURN THEM?

19:07.583 --> 19:09.166
IF THE GLOVES MELTED,
THERE WOULD BE RESIDUE

19:09.166 --> 19:12.500
ON THE UNDERSIDE
OF THE GRATE.

19:13.709 --> 19:16.542
- IT'S JUST FOR SHOW.

19:16.542 --> 19:19.417
WHO NEEDS A FIRE
IN THIS CLIMATE?

19:19.417 --> 19:21.500
I'M ZOEY. I LIVE HERE.
- HEY.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.083
- I JUST THOUGHT
I'D STOP BY,

19:23.083 --> 19:24.125
SEE HOW THE OPEN HOUSE
WAS GOING.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.291
- OH.
IT'S A NICE PLACE.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.417
- THANKS.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.583
- FAMILY FRIENDLY.

19:28.583 --> 19:31.333
- MM.

19:31.333 --> 19:35.917
I'LL BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU
A TOUR IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.291
- VERY INTERESTED.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.792
- OKAY, FOLLOW ME.

19:44.625 --> 19:48.500
- WOW, MY DAUGHTER WOULD
GO CRAZY OVER THIS ROOM.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.083
- IT'S A LITTLE GIRL'S
DREAM.

19:51.083 --> 19:53.500
- MAY I ASK
WHY YOU'RE SELLING?

19:53.500 --> 19:56.333
- MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE SEPARATED.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.166
NOW OUR DAUGHTER'S
WITH HIM.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.417
- SO YOU'RE SINGLE.

20:00.417 --> 20:04.125
- I AM.

20:04.125 --> 20:07.208
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED LONG?

20:07.208 --> 20:11.875
- UH, YES,
ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.625
AH, THAT CAME OUT WRONG.
- [laughs]

20:14.625 --> 20:17.875
I UNDERSTAND.
BELIEVE ME.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.208
- ZOEY, THERE'S A COUPLE HERE
WHO HAVE A QUESTION

20:20.208 --> 20:21.458
ABOUT THE HOT TUB.

20:21.458 --> 20:24.709
- OKAY,
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

20:24.709 --> 20:26.083
TO BE CONTINUED.

20:26.083 --> 20:29.166
- SURE.

20:34.291 --> 20:39.208
A LITTLE GIRL'S DREAM...

20:41.542 --> 20:44.375
FOLLOW THE BLOOD.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.667
FOLLOW THE BLOOD...

20:47.667 --> 20:49.250
ZOEY CRAWLED
INTO THE KITCHEN,

20:49.250 --> 20:51.875
GRABBED THE COUNTER
TO PULL HERSELF UP,

20:51.875 --> 20:54.083
THEN REACHED
FOR THE PHONE,

20:54.083 --> 20:57.750
GIVING HER
A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

20:57.750 --> 21:00.709
TO USE
THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

21:13.917 --> 21:17.041
- HOW WE DOING IN HERE?

21:17.041 --> 21:19.041
- UH, THERE SEEMS TO BE
A PROBLEM WITH THE DISPOSAL.

21:19.041 --> 21:23.000
- OH.
[sighs]

21:23.000 --> 21:25.125
OH, NO, NO, NO.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.250
- IT'S PROBABLY JUST
SOMETHING JAMMED IN THERE.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.959
IT'S AN EASY FIX.

21:27.959 --> 21:28.917
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.

21:28.917 --> 21:33.417
- YOU'D DO THAT?
- SURE.

21:55.667 --> 21:56.834
BLUE NITRILE.

21:56.834 --> 22:02.333
THE SAME MATERIAL FOUND
IN POLICE PROTECTIVE GLOVES.

22:03.792 --> 22:06.625
IF THE GLOVE FITS...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
- ISN'T HE A DOLL?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
FIXING THE DISPOSAL.
- HUH.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.834
WASN'T BROKEN THIS MORNING.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.417
- GIVE IT A TRY.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.750
- ALL RIGHT.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.625
- YAY!

22:31.000 --> 22:33.333
- IF I WAS YOUR WIFE,

22:33.333 --> 22:35.500
I'D HANG ON TO YOU.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.709
YOU'RE SO...HANDY.

22:37.709 --> 22:41.709
- [chuckles]

22:43.250 --> 22:45.333
- SO IT'S EITHER

22:45.333 --> 22:48.375
THE CANNERY BLUDGEONING
OR THE BAR BEATING.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.375
- THE CANNERY BODY
WAS A DUMP.

22:50.375 --> 22:52.000
TRINITY'S NOT A DUMPER.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.125
HE PICKS A LOCATION,
TAKES HIS VICTIMS THERE.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.458
- SO IT'S THE BAR.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.208
- HMM.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.792
- FUCKIN' A.

23:00.792 --> 23:05.041
WE'VE FOUND TRINITY'S
30-YEAR-OLD KILL SITE.

23:05.041 --> 23:07.834
OH! OH, NO, OH!
- HERE, HERE, HERE.

23:07.834 --> 23:10.667
- FUCK ME.
- TAKE THE FILE, TAKE THE FILE.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.875
NO HARM.
[clears throat]

23:12.875 --> 23:16.208
UM, MIND IF I...?

23:16.208 --> 23:19.166
- YEAH, SURE,
WHY DON'T YOU?

23:26.041 --> 23:29.875
SO, UH, 30 YEARS AGO,

23:29.875 --> 23:32.000
A FATHER OF TWO
WAS BLUDGEONED TO DEATH

23:32.000 --> 23:35.166
BETWEEN THE HOURS
OF 7:00 AND 10:00 P.M.

23:35.166 --> 23:38.000
IN THE BATHROOM
OF MURPHY'S TAVERN.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.750
- WHICH IS WHERE
I'LL BE TODAY.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.792
- ME TOO.

23:42.792 --> 23:46.000
- WON'T THAT BE A PROBLEM
WITH ASHTON?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.667
- ANTON.

23:47.667 --> 23:53.125
AND, NO,
HE'S COOL...SORT OF.

23:53.125 --> 23:55.250
- SORT OF?

23:55.250 --> 24:00.041
- HE GETS JEALOUS
FOR NO REASON.

24:00.041 --> 24:02.959
- HE'S A SMART MAN.

24:07.834 --> 24:12.250
- LOOK, DON'T MAKE ME COME UP
WITH THOUGHT BUBBLES

24:12.250 --> 24:16.125
TO PUT OVER THOSE SILENT LOOKS
OF YOURS.

24:16.125 --> 24:20.959
JUST SAY
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.625
- ALL RIGHT.

24:24.625 --> 24:28.583
I, UH, I THOUGHT I COULD KEEP
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU

24:28.583 --> 24:32.667
AS BACKGROUND NOISE
TO THIS INVESTIGATION.

24:32.667 --> 24:36.750
BUT, IN WORKING WITH YOU,

24:36.750 --> 24:41.834
THAT NOISE HAS GOTTEN...

24:41.834 --> 24:45.458
- LOUD?

24:45.458 --> 24:49.583
- DEAFENING.

24:49.583 --> 24:53.500
BUT THEY'RE MY FEELINGS.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.458
- YUP.

24:56.458 --> 25:00.375
THEY'RE YOUR FEELINGS.

25:00.375 --> 25:04.291
- YOU'RE IN
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.875
- I AM.

25:06.875 --> 25:10.834
- AND I WOULD HATE TO...

25:10.834 --> 25:15.959
- I'D HATE THAT TOO.

25:15.959 --> 25:18.291
JESUS.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.667
I'VE GOTTA GO.

25:30.667 --> 25:34.542
- WILL I SEE YOU
TONIGHT?

25:34.542 --> 25:38.166
- I DON'T...

25:38.166 --> 25:41.625
FUCK!

25:50.125 --> 25:52.041
- IS THERE A BREAK
IN THE VACATION MURDERS CASE?

25:52.041 --> 25:57.208
- I'M HAVING INTIMATE RELATIONS
WITH LAGUERTA.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.750
- CONGRATULATIONS?

25:58.750 --> 26:01.917
- I NEED SOME ADVICE.

26:01.917 --> 26:05.959
- HUH, LOT OF WISE PEOPLE
OUT THERE.

26:05.959 --> 26:08.375
- I DON'T TRUST ANYONE ELSE
WITH THIS SECRET.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.375
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

26:10.375 --> 26:13.625
- MARIA HAS AWAKENED...

26:13.625 --> 26:15.041
MI PASION.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.458
- RIGHT.

26:16.458 --> 26:19.417
- WHEN I'M WITH HER,
I FEEL LIKE A MAN.

26:19.417 --> 26:22.375
LIKE MY HEART
IS BLOSSOMING.

26:22.375 --> 26:23.875
- THAT'S A PROBLEM?
- NO.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.583
THE PROBLEM IS
SHE WANTS TO DISCLOSE

26:26.583 --> 26:28.500
OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO THE HIGHER-UPS--

26:28.500 --> 26:31.458
WHICH I--I UNDERSTAND
IS A FORMALITY.

26:31.458 --> 26:34.917
I JUST HATE THE THOUGHT
OF THEM KNOWING.

26:34.917 --> 26:37.083
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE
EMBARRASSED.

26:37.083 --> 26:40.375
- BECAUSE ONCE
YOU DEFINE IT, IT'S DEFINED.

26:40.375 --> 26:43.542
IT'S--IT'S OFFICIALLY
OFFICIAL.

26:43.542 --> 26:45.250
- YOU'RE HER BOYFRIEND.
- EXACTLY.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.917
- NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE MOVING IN,

26:46.917 --> 26:49.583
YOUR LIFE IS GONE, AND
IT'S JUST KIDS AND NEIGHBORS

26:49.583 --> 26:52.917
AND PAINTED MUGS.

26:52.917 --> 26:54.959
- PAINTED MUGS?
- IT'S A METAPHOR.

26:54.959 --> 26:56.583
- FOR WHAT?

26:56.583 --> 26:59.709
- LOOK, IF YOU WANT OUT,
GET OUT.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.000
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING DRASTIC.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
- I DON'T WANT OUT.
I DON'T.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.250
I JUST WANT TO PROTECT IT

27:07.250 --> 27:08.709
BY KEEPING IT PRIVATE.

27:08.709 --> 27:10.375
- YEAH.

27:10.375 --> 27:13.500
- WHO KNEW IT WOULD MATTER
SO MUCH TO ME?

27:13.500 --> 27:15.083
THANKS, SOCIO.

27:15.083 --> 27:19.041
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED
ON THE DETAILS.

27:19.041 --> 27:22.083
- GREAT.

27:26.792 --> 27:31.834
I AM A STICKLER
FOR DETAILS.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.792
- YOU STILL DATING
THAT SHE-BAG REPORTER?

27:34.792 --> 27:36.542
IS IT THAT HARD
FOR YOU TO GET LAID?

27:36.542 --> 27:37.959
- I'M NOT--
- AFTER SHE PUT

27:37.959 --> 27:39.625
LUNDY'S NAME IN THE PAPER
AND RUINED EVERYTHING?

27:39.625 --> 27:41.625
- I'M NOT SEEING HER.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.333
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD HER THAT.

27:43.333 --> 27:47.875
NEWS FLASH, QUINN:
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.625
- YEAH, I GOT
YOUR MESSAGES.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.834
- BUT YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME BACK.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.250
- TELL ME, IS THIS CONVERSATION
GONNA END UP IN THE PAPER TOO?

27:55.250 --> 27:57.166
'CAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE
SHITSTORM YOU'VE GOTTEN ME INTO.

27:57.166 --> 27:59.291
- I'M SORRY.

27:59.291 --> 28:04.667
REALLY, BUT...
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

28:04.667 --> 28:07.417
- I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN WORKING IT OUT.

28:07.417 --> 28:08.667
- DON'T SAY THAT.

28:08.667 --> 28:13.166
- COME ON, IT'S NOT LIKE
THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.

28:13.166 --> 28:19.083
- DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

28:19.083 --> 28:21.834
- YOU'RE RIGHT, I WON'T.

28:21.834 --> 28:27.333
BUT IT'S WAY TOO
COMPLICATED.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.375
- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

28:29.375 --> 28:33.083
- CHRISTINE.
YOU NEVER HAD ME.

28:33.083 --> 28:36.000
FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER SOURCE.

28:45.542 --> 28:48.000
- ON VACATION,
WE BUY SNOW GLOBES,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.041
SEND POSTCARDS TO PRESERVE
THE GOOD TIMES,

28:51.041 --> 28:53.709
REMIND US WHERE WE'VE BEEN.

28:55.166 --> 28:58.542
ZOEY'S CRIME SCENE
HAD ITS OWN MEMENTO...

28:58.542 --> 29:01.417
A GLOVE WHOSE ROLLED CUFF
PRESERVED THE GUNSHOT RESIDUE

29:01.417 --> 29:06.542
AFTER SHE SHOT HERSELF.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.834
AND BLOOD.

29:08.834 --> 29:12.542
ODDS ARE IT BELONGS TO
THE LATE DARIUS RAE.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.417
AH, ZOEY,
WISH YOU WERE HERE.

29:15.417 --> 29:17.917
BUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT...

29:17.917 --> 29:19.959
I'LL COME TO YOU.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.125
I SHOULD GET TO PEMBROKE PINES
JUST IN TIME

29:22.125 --> 29:24.875
TO FOLLOW
OFFICER KRUGER HOME.

29:26.250 --> 29:31.667
- ORIGINAL STRUCTURE
WAS A SINGLE-STORY TAVERN.

29:31.667 --> 29:34.291
CURRENT BUILDING--

29:34.291 --> 29:36.583
12 FLOORS, MOSTLY VACANT.

29:57.125 --> 30:01.083
- I'M FOUND.

30:18.458 --> 30:22.041
- LOBBY'S OPEN 24 HOURS,
GUARD ON DUTY,

30:22.041 --> 30:23.959
TOO MUCH FOOT TRAFFIC--
TRINITY WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE

30:23.959 --> 30:26.291
ANOTHER FLOOR.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.792
- SO SORRY.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.291
I WASN'T WATCHING
WHERE I WAS GOING.

30:29.291 --> 30:32.417
- NO DAMAGE DONE.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.125
EXCUSE ME.

30:46.333 --> 30:49.667
YOU DROPPED THESE.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.709
- THANKS.

31:08.583 --> 31:11.000
BUS NUMBER 432.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.834
WHITE MALE, MAYBE 6'4",

31:13.834 --> 31:16.500
200, 220 POUNDS,

31:16.500 --> 31:18.458
AGE AROUND 60,

31:18.458 --> 31:22.917
HAIR GRAY, EYES BLUE...

31:22.917 --> 31:26.000
SOMETHING IN THEM.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.625
- MAYBE I DO MISS
RITA AND THE KIDS...

31:34.625 --> 31:35.959
[line rings]

31:35.959 --> 31:37.542
- [baby cries]
- HELLO?

31:37.542 --> 31:38.750
- HI, IT'S ME.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.542
- OH, UH,
HEY, GUYS, KEEP IT DOWN.

31:40.542 --> 31:42.125
- I WAS JUST CHECKING IN.

31:42.125 --> 31:44.083
- OH, WE HAVE THE REHEARSAL
DINNER IN 20 MINUTES,

31:44.083 --> 31:46.875
AND--ASTOR, YOUR DRESS
IS GETTING WRINKLED.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.667
- SOUNDS LIKE
YOU GOT YOUR HANDS--

31:48.667 --> 31:49.709
- HEY, CODY.
[indistinct]

31:49.709 --> 31:51.041
I'M SORRY,
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

31:51.041 --> 31:53.208
- I WAS JUST SAYING
YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR HANDS--

31:53.208 --> 31:54.583
- MOM, CODY PULLED
MY BARRETTES OUT.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.333
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.291
- YOU TOOK THEM
RIGHT OFF MY HEAD.

31:58.291 --> 32:01.041
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.375
- IT WAS...NOTHING.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.917
- UH, WE GOTTA GO.
LOVE YOU.

32:04.917 --> 32:06.250
- ME...
[dial tone]

32:06.250 --> 32:09.291
TOO.

32:12.917 --> 32:16.375
[siren whoops]

32:16.375 --> 32:17.917
SHIT!

32:17.917 --> 32:20.417
GOING THE SPEED LIMIT,
HANDS-FREE DIALING,

32:20.417 --> 32:21.375
NO VIOLATIONS.

32:21.375 --> 32:24.917
[siren wailing]

32:33.917 --> 32:35.750
THIS IS BAD.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.750
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

32:37.750 --> 32:40.709
- OUT OF THE VEHICLE,
PLEASE.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.166
HANDS ON THE HOOD,
PLEASE.

32:51.500 --> 32:55.417
- MY WIFE AND I CHANGED
OUR MIND ABOUT BUYING A HOUSE.

32:55.417 --> 32:59.625
- DEXTER MORGAN.

32:59.625 --> 33:04.208
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT YOU WERE
A, UH, SPATTER ANALYST,

33:04.208 --> 33:07.917
MIAMI METRO.

33:07.917 --> 33:11.750
- DIDN'T SEEM RELEVANT
TO HOUSE HUNTING.

33:11.750 --> 33:14.959
- HMM.

33:14.959 --> 33:17.709
WELL, THE FILE CLERK
AT MY STATION--

33:17.709 --> 33:19.458
HE'S A FRIEND.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.458
HE TOLD ME THAT SAM
HAD PULLED MY CASE FILE,

33:21.458 --> 33:24.625
AND SAM TOLD ME HE'D
LOANED IT TO A COLLEAGUE.

33:24.625 --> 33:27.500
YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE
WHEN I LOOKED UP THAT COLLEAGUE

33:27.500 --> 33:30.000
AND SAW YOUR FACE.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.792
- I AM WRITING A PAPER
ON BLOOD SWIPES.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.125
- ARE YOU
GETTING OFF ON THIS?

33:34.125 --> 33:36.000
- AM I SUPPOSED TO BE?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.917
- YOU'RE THE KIND OF SICKO
WHO LIKES WATCHING

33:37.917 --> 33:40.834
A WOMAN IN PAIN?

33:40.834 --> 33:44.667
- NOT THAT KIND OF SICKO, NO.

33:44.667 --> 33:47.959
- I LOST MY HUSBAND.

33:47.959 --> 33:52.166
I WATCHED MY CHILD DIE
IN FRONT OF ME.

33:52.166 --> 33:55.208
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW AGONIZING THAT WAS?

33:55.208 --> 33:57.959
- AGONY WOULD BE
THE NORMAL REACTION.

33:57.959 --> 34:01.166
- I WILL NOT LET
THAT WOUND BE REOPENED.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.834
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

34:15.041 --> 34:16.583
TRAFFIC'S HEAVY
ON BRICKELL.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.709
MIGHT WANT TO AVOID IT
ON YOUR WAY HOME.

34:18.709 --> 34:21.125
WAS, UH,

34:21.125 --> 34:24.375
3319 MEADOW LANE,
RIGHT?

34:24.375 --> 34:27.959
I'M LETTING YOU OFF
WITH A WARNING.

34:27.959 --> 34:32.041
DRIVE CAREFULLY.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.750
- I'M CALLING IT OFF.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.417
- YOU CAN'T.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.542
SHE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.500
- SHE KNOWS WHO DEXTER MORGAN
LAB GEEK IS.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.083
- SHE KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE,

34:48.083 --> 34:49.834
WHERE YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN
WILL BE WHEN THEY GET HOME

34:49.834 --> 34:51.166
IN 48 HOURS.

34:51.166 --> 34:54.333
- IF I BACK OFF,
SHE BACKS OFF.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.583
- STILL LEAVES YOU
ON THE RADAR OF A KILLER COP

34:56.583 --> 34:58.917
WHO HAS NO QUALMS
ABOUT SHOOTING HER FAMILY,

34:58.917 --> 35:00.583
MUCH LESS A LAB RAT.

35:00.583 --> 35:01.834
- SHE'S STALKING ME.

35:01.834 --> 35:04.083
TAKING HER BY SURPRISE WILL BE
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

35:04.083 --> 35:08.375
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WANTED A CHALLENGE.

35:10.583 --> 35:13.625
AND NOW YOU'VE
BATTED THE BEEHIVE.

35:13.625 --> 35:14.750
[beeps]

35:14.750 --> 35:16.500
- DEXTER,
FRANK LUNDY HERE.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.125
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
AT HOME.

35:18.125 --> 35:19.917
I WAS JUST TRYING TO REACH
YOUR SISTER.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.625
THOUGHT
SHE WAS MAYBE WITH YOU.

35:21.625 --> 35:26.917
I HAD AN INTERESTING
ENCOUNTER TODAY.

35:26.917 --> 35:30.458
- ME TOO.

35:35.500 --> 35:39.667
- GOTTA ADMIT,
SHE IS IMPRESSIVE.

35:39.667 --> 35:41.208
MAKES YOU WONDER
WHY SOMEONE LIKE HER

35:41.208 --> 35:43.959
EVER GOT MARRIED AND HAD KIDS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

35:43.959 --> 35:48.333
- SOMEONE LIKE HER?

35:48.333 --> 35:52.417
SOMEONE LIKE HER
NEEDS TO BE IN CONTROL.

35:54.125 --> 35:57.542
- AND SHE THINKS SHE IS.

35:57.542 --> 36:00.417
- SHE WON'T SEE ME COMING.

36:03.542 --> 36:06.083
[phone rings]

36:06.083 --> 36:07.875
- PEMBROKE PINES
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.583
- RECORDS, PLEASE?

36:09.583 --> 36:12.959
- TRANSFERRING.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.542
- RECORDS,
LANGSBURY SPEAKING.

36:15.542 --> 36:18.375
- UH, YEAH,
THIS IS MIAMI METRO FORENSICS.

36:18.375 --> 36:22.125
I WANTED TO REQUEST COPIES
OF A SUSPECT'S FILE.

36:22.125 --> 36:23.834
- SUSPECT'S NAME?

36:23.834 --> 36:25.917
- UH, DARIUS R.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.917
THAT'S RAE WITH AN E.

36:27.917 --> 36:32.333
DRUG DEALER AND ALLEGED KILLER
OF ZOEY KRUGER'S FAMILY.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.875
- WHAT IS THIS
IN REGARD TO?

36:33.875 --> 36:38.291
- I--WE'RE--IT INVOLVES
THE VACATION MURDERS CASE.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.458
- I'LL SEND THE FILE OVER.

36:40.458 --> 36:41.959
TO WHOSE ATTENTION?

36:41.959 --> 36:46.333
- JUST, UH, FORENSICS.

36:49.667 --> 36:52.583
BATTING THE BEEHIVE.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.417
- DEXTER.

37:10.291 --> 37:11.500
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.625
- I'M GONNA CHOOSE
NOT TO MISINTERPRET THAT.

37:14.625 --> 37:18.583
- WHEN ANGEL SAID
HE TOLD YOU ABOUT US, I WAS...

37:18.583 --> 37:20.041
ANGRY, TO SAY THE LEAST.

37:20.041 --> 37:23.000
- I REALLY DIDN'T
WANT TO KNOW.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.583
- BUT NOW YOU DO.
- YEAH.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.458
- ACTUALLY,
I'M GLAD BECAUSE

37:27.458 --> 37:31.709
I COULD REALLY USE
A MAN'S OPINION ON HOW TO HANDLE

37:31.709 --> 37:34.458
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

37:34.458 --> 37:39.417
OR FLING, OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT HE AND I ARE DOING NAKED.

37:39.417 --> 37:41.834
- WELL, I WAS JUST
GOING TO LUNCH.

37:41.834 --> 37:45.500
- THAT'S GREAT.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.875
BETH'S CAFE SOUND GOOD?

37:47.875 --> 37:52.834
- OH, ACTUALLY,
WE SHOULD JUST TALK HERE.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.709
IT'S MORE PRIVATE.

37:54.709 --> 37:57.750
- YEAH.

38:00.583 --> 38:03.709
ANGEL'S A GREAT COP.
THE BEST I KNOW.

38:03.709 --> 38:07.542
BUT HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THE POLITICS IN THIS BUILDING.

38:07.542 --> 38:11.583
AND WE HAVE TO MANAGE
HOW THIS THING BECOMES PUBLIC.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.583
AND IF IT'S HANDLED WRONG,
OUR JOBS COULD BE AT RISK.

38:14.583 --> 38:19.667
AND WE CAN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

38:19.667 --> 38:23.792
- I...NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING
TO CHANCE.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.625
- THANK YOU.

38:32.625 --> 38:34.667
YOU'RE GETTING GOOD
AT THIS RELATIONSHIP STUFF.

38:34.667 --> 38:38.667
MM, MARRIAGE AGREES
WITH YOU.

38:38.667 --> 38:41.250
THANK YOU.

38:44.959 --> 38:47.166
- LUNDY CALLED LAST NIGHT.
HE WAS TRYING TO REACH YOU.

38:47.166 --> 38:48.875
- [laughs]

38:48.875 --> 38:52.458
THAT IS JUST SO...

38:52.458 --> 38:57.417
FUCKING GREAT.

38:57.417 --> 39:00.500
- OKAY.

39:11.959 --> 39:14.208
LOOKS LIKE
THE BEEHIVE IS BUZZING.

39:14.208 --> 39:16.458
AND HERE COMES THE STING.

39:37.250 --> 39:41.375
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR
JURISDICTION, OFFICER KRUGER.

39:53.917 --> 39:57.000
WAIT FOR IT.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.291
- [stammers]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:03.291 --> 40:04.875
- YOU WANT INFO
ON DARIUS RAE?

40:04.875 --> 40:06.250
ASK ME ANYTHING.

40:06.250 --> 40:09.041
- THAT FILE WAS
FOR A CASE I'M WORKING.

40:09.041 --> 40:12.583
- I ASKED YOU NICELY
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

40:12.583 --> 40:15.375
- YOU THREATENED ME.

40:15.375 --> 40:17.250
- YOU THINK THAT
WAS A THREAT?

40:17.250 --> 40:20.125
- WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
MURDER ME TOO?

40:20.125 --> 40:22.583
LIKE YOU MURDERED
YOUR FAMILY?

40:22.583 --> 40:25.583
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER?

40:25.583 --> 40:27.417
- YOU'RE SICK.

40:27.417 --> 40:28.959
- I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

40:28.959 --> 40:31.834
I HAVE PROOF.

40:31.834 --> 40:34.083
- NOT POSSIBLE.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.250
- FROM THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL,

40:35.250 --> 40:37.333
THE GLOVES
YOU WORE THAT NIGHT.

40:37.333 --> 40:39.583
THERE WAS GUN RESIDUE
ON THEM.

40:39.583 --> 40:42.166
I HAVE A MEETING WITH
MY SUPERIORS TOMORROW MORNING

40:42.166 --> 40:46.458
TO TELL THEM EVERYTHING.

40:46.458 --> 40:48.333
- THERE'S NO CHAIN OF
CUSTODY.

40:48.333 --> 40:50.417
- STILL,
IT'LL RAISE QUESTIONS.

40:50.417 --> 40:52.875
AND IF YOU LEFT
THIS MUCH BEHIND,

40:52.875 --> 40:55.750
WE'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

41:05.166 --> 41:08.959
- YOU'RE TRYING TO RAPE ME.

41:08.959 --> 41:11.625
- I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU.

41:11.625 --> 41:14.458
- THAT'S WHY
YOU CAME TO MY HOUSE.

41:14.458 --> 41:16.208
AND THE REAL ESTATE AGENT
WILL TESTIFY THAT

41:16.208 --> 41:18.917
YOU WERE FLIRTING WITH ME.

41:18.917 --> 41:23.625
AND THEN YOU STALKED ME HERE
AND TRIED TO ASSAULT ME.

41:23.625 --> 41:25.625
AND I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF.

41:25.625 --> 41:28.041
- EXCEPT...

41:28.041 --> 41:29.917
THE BLOWBACK OF MY BLOOD
INTO THE MUZZLE OF YOUR GUN

41:29.917 --> 41:32.375
WILL SHOW
A FLAT CONTACT SHOT

41:32.375 --> 41:35.083
THAT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY
DURING A STRUGGLE.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.875
YOU COULD SHOOT ME
CENTER MASS,

41:41.875 --> 41:43.583
BUT THE LOW DIRECTIONALITY
WILL SHOW

41:43.583 --> 41:46.250
I WAS IN
A DEFENSIVE POSITION.

41:46.250 --> 41:49.250
YOU'D HAVE TO CALCULATE
THE EXACT DISTANCE

41:49.250 --> 41:53.458
TO CREATE A SPATTER PATTERN
THAT SUPPORTS SELF-DEFENSE.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.834
- GO AHEAD.

42:01.834 --> 42:04.667
TELL THEM.

42:04.667 --> 42:07.834
NO ONE
IS GOING TO BELIEVE YOU

42:07.834 --> 42:12.041
OVER ME.

42:12.041 --> 42:14.875
SO PLEASE.

42:14.875 --> 42:16.542
TELL THEM...

42:16.542 --> 42:20.291
EVERYTHING.

42:24.583 --> 42:29.500
- YOU WON'T
GIVE ME THE CHANCE.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.709
I'M COUNTING ON IT.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.542
[knocks]

42:42.375 --> 42:44.458
- DEBRA.

42:44.458 --> 42:46.333
YOU'RE HERE.

42:46.333 --> 42:48.542
I CALLED BECAUSE,
TRINITY, I--

42:48.542 --> 42:50.166
- SHUT UP.

43:04.500 --> 43:07.583
- THIS TIME
SHE WON'T COME IN A SQUAD CAR.

43:07.583 --> 43:11.333
THIS TIME IT WON'T BE
ABOUT THREATS AND INTIMIDATION.

43:11.333 --> 43:15.208
THIS TIME, IT'S FOR REAL.

43:17.542 --> 43:18.875
THEY'RE ALL PROPS,

43:18.875 --> 43:22.709
THE CAMOUFLAGE
OF A FAMILY MAN.

43:22.709 --> 43:25.667
SHE'LL BELIEVE THEM.

43:25.667 --> 43:28.542
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM,

43:28.542 --> 43:31.667
BUT I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO SHE IS.

43:31.667 --> 43:34.917
MARCO...

43:37.291 --> 43:39.709
POLO.

43:46.250 --> 43:47.875
- SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE I WALKED IN

43:47.875 --> 43:49.291
ON A HOME ROBBERY,

43:49.291 --> 43:51.208
GOT MYSELF KILLED.

43:51.208 --> 43:54.750
SHE'S GOOD AT CREATING
THE NARRATIVE OF A CRIME.

44:15.208 --> 44:18.750
THAT HAND'S THE FIRST THING
I CUT OFF.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.959
[grunts]

44:30.959 --> 44:33.166
- [cries]

44:33.166 --> 44:35.792
- SURPRISE.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.125
- [grunts]

45:03.667 --> 45:06.458
HELP!
HELP!

45:06.458 --> 45:07.875
HELP!

45:07.875 --> 45:10.834
SORRY, SORRY, I WAS JUST
BUYING YOUR TICKETS.

45:10.834 --> 45:14.083
YOU'RE TAKING A BOAT
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

45:14.083 --> 45:16.917
EVENTUALLY YOU'LL LAND
IN THE PHILIPPINES.

45:16.917 --> 45:20.750
YOU'RE SMART, THERE'S NO
EXTRADITION TREATY THERE.

45:20.750 --> 45:24.000
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

45:26.417 --> 45:29.000
- I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT
CREATING A NARRATIVE TOO.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.875
SUITCASES PACKED, YOUR CAR
WILL BE LEFT AT THE PORT,

45:32.875 --> 45:36.625
AND THE BLUE GLOVE
IS BACK IN YOUR DISPOSAL.

45:36.625 --> 45:38.625
YOU'LL FLEE THE COUNTRY.

45:38.625 --> 45:43.333
YOU'LL--WHOOSH--
NEVER BE CAUGHT.

45:43.333 --> 45:46.709
YOU'RE THAT GOOD.

45:46.709 --> 45:49.250
OR THAT DEAD.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.792
- YOU'RE GONNA
RAPE AND KILL ME?

45:50.792 --> 45:52.375
- [laughs]
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND RAPE?

45:52.375 --> 45:55.500
NO ONE'S RAPING ANYONE.

45:55.500 --> 45:59.333
MM, KILLING
ON THE OTHER HAND.

45:59.333 --> 46:02.959
- WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

46:02.959 --> 46:06.250
- WHY DID YOU
DO THIS TO THEM?

46:06.250 --> 46:08.291
- IT WAS DARIUS RAE.

46:08.291 --> 46:11.542
- NO, YOU WANTED OUT.

46:11.542 --> 46:13.583
YOU WANTED YOUR FREEDOM.

46:13.583 --> 46:18.417
FROM
THE CONSTANT DEMANDS...

46:18.417 --> 46:19.667
THEY TOOK IT ALL.

46:19.667 --> 46:24.750
AND THEY WANTED MORE.

46:24.750 --> 46:27.166
- I COULDN'T BREATHE.

46:27.166 --> 46:31.542
- YOU DID IT TO SURVIVE.

46:31.542 --> 46:35.959
- YOU UNDERSTAND.

46:35.959 --> 46:39.083
- I UNDERSTAND, ALL RIGHT.

46:48.625 --> 46:50.959
- LOOK AT YOU.

46:50.959 --> 46:54.792
WHAT KIND OF FATHER
DOES THIS?

46:54.792 --> 46:58.625
WHAT KIND OF HUSBAND?

47:02.125 --> 47:03.083
[groans]

47:03.083 --> 47:07.792
- NOT THE KIND
WHO KILLS HIS FAMILY.

47:17.709 --> 47:21.333
- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO CHOOSE.

47:21.333 --> 47:25.166
- NOT WHAT YOU CHOSE.

47:25.166 --> 47:28.875
- YOU CAN'T HIDE
WHAT YOU ARE.

47:28.875 --> 47:30.542
- OH, I CAN.

47:30.542 --> 47:32.959
I'M BETTER AT IT
THAN YOU.

47:32.959 --> 47:36.333
- YOU WILL CHOOSE
YOUR LIFE OVER THEIRS.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.959
- I WON'T.

47:37.959 --> 47:41.458
I'D RATHER RISK
THEM KNOWING THE TRUTH...

47:43.000 --> 47:46.208
THAN LOSE THEM.

47:51.208 --> 47:54.000
WOW.

47:57.583 --> 47:59.291
[sighs]

47:59.291 --> 48:03.709
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEM.

48:03.709 --> 48:06.750
I DON'T.

48:11.208 --> 48:14.417
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US.

48:16.333 --> 48:19.083
- [groans]

48:25.875 --> 48:29.041
- NICE SOUVENIR.

48:37.417 --> 48:39.625
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO STAY HERE?

48:39.625 --> 48:43.625
- YOU DIDN'T RAISE
A LONER, DAD.

48:43.625 --> 48:46.667
- MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.

48:46.667 --> 48:48.417
- I'LL SURVIVE.

48:48.417 --> 48:51.542
- YOU SURE?

48:54.542 --> 48:56.709
BETTER SEE
TO THAT DRIP, SON.

48:56.709 --> 48:58.959
YOU DON'T WANT THIS PLACE
GOING TO HELL.

48:58.959 --> 49:00.417
YOU NEED IT TOO MUCH.

49:00.417 --> 49:02.375
- MY OWN LITTLE
VACATION SPOT.

49:02.375 --> 49:06.875
[phone rings]

49:06.875 --> 49:09.125
HEY, HOW YOU GUYS
DOING UP THERE?

49:09.125 --> 49:10.250
- WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

49:10.250 --> 49:11.500
WE LEFT
RIGHT AFTER THE WEDDING.

49:11.500 --> 49:12.917
WE SHOULD BE HOME SOON.

49:12.917 --> 49:14.333
- GOOD, I'M GLAD.

49:14.333 --> 49:17.208
- THE HOUSE!

49:17.208 --> 49:21.250
- DON'T HURRY.
DRIVE SAFE.

49:53.625 --> 49:55.250
YOU'RE HOME!

49:55.250 --> 49:57.125
- YEAH, WE MADE IT.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.834
THE WEDDING
WAS EXHAUSTING.

49:58.834 --> 50:01.000
THE KIDS
WERE A NIGHTMARE.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
JUST WANTED
TO STRANGLE THEM.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
OH, NO.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.333
- YEAH, IT JUST
SLIPPED OUT OF MY HAND.

50:09.333 --> 50:12.792
SORRY.

50:12.792 --> 50:15.417
- OH, THE KIDS WILL BE EXCITED
TO MAKE YOU A NEW ONE.

50:15.417 --> 50:17.500
[sighs]

50:34.542 --> 50:37.667
[sighs softly]

50:37.667 --> 50:42.959
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

50:42.959 --> 50:46.166
- I MISSED YOU TOO.

51:17.041 --> 51:22.959
- I'M A FUCKWAD.

51:22.959 --> 51:28.417
- YOU'RE NOT A FUCKWAD.

51:28.417 --> 51:31.041
- I KNEW.

51:31.041 --> 51:32.917
FROM THE SECOND
I SAW YOU AT THE STATION,

51:32.917 --> 51:35.917
I KNEW HOW I FELT.

51:35.917 --> 51:38.417
IT'S HOW
I'VE ALWAYS FELT.

51:38.417 --> 51:41.458
I JUST WOULDN'T
ADMIT IT.

51:41.458 --> 51:46.333
'CAUSE I'M A FUCKWAD.

51:46.333 --> 51:49.500
- YOU'RE HUMAN.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.041
- AND NOW I'VE CHEATED
ON A GUY

51:51.041 --> 51:54.959
WHO DOESN'T DESERVE
TO BE TREATED THAT WAY.

51:54.959 --> 51:58.166
I SHOULD HAVE
BROKEN UP WITH HIM FIRST.

51:58.166 --> 52:01.083
BUT I'M A FUCKWAD.
- NO. DON'T.

52:01.083 --> 52:04.041
YOU'RE NOT.

52:04.041 --> 52:06.750
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

52:06.750 --> 52:10.667
AND YOU WERE CONFUSED.

52:10.667 --> 52:14.125
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT.

52:14.125 --> 52:15.625
SO...

52:15.625 --> 52:19.458
WE'LL SET THIS RIGHT,
TOGETHER.

52:19.458 --> 52:22.250
ALL RIGHT?

52:41.083 --> 52:44.625
- DON'T GO DISAPPEARING
ON ME AGAIN.

52:44.625 --> 52:46.959
- NOT A--

52:46.959 --> 52:50.125
[gunshot]

53:00.500 --> 53:04.166
[two gunshots]

53:28.041 --> 53:31.333
- STAY WITH ME.
