THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.161

THE LORD SAID,

00:27.195 --> 00:29.497
WHAT GOES INTO
A MAN'S MOUTH

00:29.530 --> 00:31.665
CANNOT MAKE HIM UNCLEAN.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.402
FOR IT MOVES THROUGH
HIS STOMACH AND OUT HIS BODY.

00:34.435 --> 00:38.472
WHAT COMES OUT
OF A MAN'S MOUTH IS UNCLEAN,

00:38.506 --> 00:40.308
FOR IT COMES
FROM THE HEART,

00:40.341 --> 00:42.843
WHERE EVIL LURKS.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.247
IMMORALITY, ADULTERY, LUST!

00:46.280 --> 00:49.083
- HEY! WHY DON'T YOU

00:55.589 --> 00:57.258
AND THE LORD SAID,

00:57.291 --> 01:01.129
EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN SIN
IS A SLAVE TO SIN.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.664
WHOA TO THE YOUNG LADY WHO
ENFLAMES HERSELF WITH ALCOHOL,

01:03.697 --> 01:08.736
FOR IT POISONS THE BLOOD.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.206
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.375
SISTER, SISTER, SISTER.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.877
SISTER, SISTER.
SHH.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.147
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.181
OHH.

01:20.214 --> 01:23.384

01:24.752 --> 01:26.720

01:26.754 --> 01:27.855
- SAYS SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.158
- AND HE ATTACKED HER
HOW MANY TIMES?

01:30.191 --> 01:32.793
- SHE TOLD THE EMTs FOUR
OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.829
- THAT'S A FIRST
FOR A STRANGER RAPIST.

01:35.863 --> 01:36.830
WHAT'S THE VICTIM'S NAME?

01:36.864 --> 01:37.931
- JULIE MCMANUS.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.634
CAME IN DISORIENTED WITH
NUMEROUS SCALP LACERATIONS.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.537
I REMOVED A DOZEN
GLASS SHARDS FROM HER HEAD.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.274
NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT SURE
HOW REAL THIS IS.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.341
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE HER?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.776
- SHE REEKS LIKE A WINO.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.245
I'M WAITING FOR THE RESULTS
ON HER BLOOD ALCOHOL.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.913
- IF SHE SAID THAT
SHE WAS RAPED, SHE WAS RAPED.

01:52.946 --> 01:53.881
- I WASN'T RAPED!

01:53.914 --> 01:56.850
- JULIE, WAIT!

01:56.884 --> 01:57.685
- YOU CALLED THE POLICE?

01:57.718 --> 01:59.753
- JULIE, WE'RE JUST HERE
TO HELP YOU.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.623
- YOU TOLD THE EMTs
THAT YOU WERE RAPED.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.758
DR. TANAKA TOOK
SHARDS OF GLASS

02:04.792 --> 02:05.926
OUT OF YOUR SCALP.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.695
- I'M FINE.
I FELL.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.829
IT'S A MISTAKE.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.298
- JULIE, YOU NEED A RAPE KIT.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.499
THERE COULD
BE EVIDENCE ON YOU

02:11.532 --> 02:12.633
THAT COULD HELP US
FIND THE GUY--

02:12.666 --> 02:14.702
- I JUST HAVE TO GET HOME.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.903
- JULIE!

02:15.936 --> 02:19.873
HEY, DON'T TAKE A SHOWER,
IN CASE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.364
- PASSENGER THAT GOT ON
THE BUS WITH JULIE

03:16.397 --> 03:18.332
SAW HER STAGGER
OUT OF THIS ALLEY.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.199
- YEAH, BLOOD DROPS.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.335
LEADING FROM THE ALLEY
TO THE BUS STOP.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.703
- HOW FRESH?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.805
- FRESH ENOUGH FOR CSU
TO GET A TYPE A-NEGATIVE.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.240
- OH, SAME AS JULIE'S.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.609
PERP MUST HAVE
ATTACKED HER RIGHT THERE.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.977
- MORE BLOOD

03:30.010 --> 03:31.712
ANYBODY CATCH WIND?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.347
- ONLY FROM
THE AIR CONDITIONERS.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.649
THE GUY SAID HE HEARD SOME CATS
FIGHTING LATE LAST NIGHT,

03:35.683 --> 03:36.750
BUT HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.885
- I FOUND SOMETHIN'!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.453
HEY, CHARLIE,

MUCH MORE VALUABLE.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.693
BROKEN BOTTLE OF BOOZE.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.960
- SAME COLOR
AS THE GLASS SHARDS

03:46.994 --> 03:48.529
FOUND IN JULIE'S SCALP.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.630
- THE BOTTLE'S BUSTED,

03:49.663 --> 03:51.832
LIKE THE PERP GRABBED IT
BY THE NECK AND CROWNED HER.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.734
- OR SHE AND ANOTHER DRUNK
WERE FIGHTING OVER IT,

03:53.767 --> 03:54.968
AND JULIE LOST.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.837
- SHE WASN'T DRUNK.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.873
DOC SAID HE DIDN'T FIND A DROP
OF ALCOHOL IN JULIE'S BLOOD.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.642
- HER NAME IS NOT JULIE MCMANUS.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.478
CSU GOT A HIT OFF
A THUMBPRINT FROM THE BOTTLE.

04:04.512 --> 04:08.516
AND IT BELONGS TO A WOMAN
NAMED VICKI ALICIA SAYERS.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.050
- WELL, SHE GAVE
THE HOSPITAL A FAKE NAME.

04:10.083 --> 04:10.851
HAS SHE BEEN
IN ANY TROUBLE?

04:10.884 --> 04:11.819
- NO, HER PRINTS
ARE IN THE SYSTEM

04:11.852 --> 04:14.054
BECAUSE SHE APPLIED
FOR A CIVIL SERVANT JOB.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.589
- ADDRESS IS IN MID-TOWN.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.325
- YEAH, THAT'S BOGUS.
THERE'S NO PHONE.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.060
THERE'S NO RECORD OF

04:20.093 --> 04:21.929
TRYING TO MAKE HERSELF
INVISIBLE.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.364
- I DON'T BLAME HER.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.598
SHE'S BEEN RAPED FOUR TIMES
BY THE SAME GUY.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.899
- OLIVIA...

04:25.933 --> 04:27.301
- OH, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, CAPTAIN.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.670
- NO COMPLAINING WITNESS,
NO CASE.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.039
- I WAS GOING TO SAY
IF THERE'S A RAPIST OUT THERE,

04:32.072 --> 04:34.708
WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO COLLAR HIM.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.311
- WELL, THE ODDS ARE THAT SHE
LIVES OR WORKS

04:37.345 --> 04:38.546
NEAR THE AREA
SHE WAS ATTACKED.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.713
- YEAH, BUT WE CAN'T BE
KNOCKING ON EVERY DOOR

04:39.747 --> 04:41.048
IN THE WASHINGTON HEIGHTS
AREA.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.851
- BUT WE CAN CHECK HER OUT
THROUGH THE TAX MAN.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.987
SHE'D HAVE TO USE HER REAL NAME
TO PAY THE PIPER.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.390
GET A SUBPOENA
FOR THE CITY TAX ROLLS.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.329
[doorbell buzzing]

04:57.531 --> 04:58.666

04:58.699 --> 05:00.701

SO I CAN STOP HIM.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.359

05:25.393 --> 05:27.695

I CAN HELP YOU.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.098

06:01.094 --> 06:05.065
- NO, OUR DELIVERY LADY

06:07.801 --> 06:10.170
VICKI'S SO PARANOID,
SHE DOESN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.872
SHE PROBABLY
HAS A THROWAWAY CELL TOO.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.441
- SO WE CAN'T TRACE IT.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.411

LOSE HER LIFE IF YOU DON'T.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.536

06:42.570 --> 06:44.104
SO SHE DOESN'T
HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.039
I PAY HER BILLS

[handcuffs snapping]

10:07.875 --> 10:08.909
PLEASE.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.249

I DIDN'T SHOOT YOU

10:17.317 --> 10:19.787
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.022

10:22.055 --> 10:26.860

WHO'S BEEN ATTACKING YOU.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.229

10:37.705 --> 10:38.672
THAT'S THE ANSWER?

10:38.706 --> 10:41.341

I PUSHED YOU.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.021
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF WE HAVE ANY TIME LEFT.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.889
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:55.923 --> 10:57.457

10:57.490 --> 11:00.894
HE NEARLY KILLED YOU
WITH THAT BOTTLE.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.897

- THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO ME.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.917
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED YOUR CLOTHES.

11:23.951 --> 11:29.222
AND I CAN SEE...
THAT YOU DIDN'T SHOWER.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.391
- YOU SAID I SHOULDN'T.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.260
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO CATCH
THIS SON OF A BITCH

11:33.293 --> 11:34.461
AS MUCH AS I DO.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.297
SO COME, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL, ALL RIGHT?

11:37.330 --> 11:38.498
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE?

11:38.531 --> 11:43.003
- WE CAN RECOVER EVIDENCE
UP TO 96 HOURS AFTER THE ATTACK.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.510
- WILL YOU STAY WITH ME?

11:50.543 --> 11:54.047
- FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

11:54.081 --> 11:58.485
- FIRST TIME HE RAPED ME
WAS 1995.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.221
I WAS 16.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.157
I WAS A CANDY STRIPER
AT A HOSPITAL.

12:09.362 --> 12:14.034
WHEN I WAS LEAVING...

12:14.067 --> 12:15.335
HE GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.736
HE HAD A KNIFE.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.775
AND HE PUSHED ME
INTO A STOREROOM CLOSET.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.444
PULLED UP MY DRESS AND...

12:24.477 --> 12:29.382
AND HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYES
WHILE HE RAPED ME.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.318
- AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM?

12:31.351 --> 12:34.487
- NO, I HAD NEVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.056
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

12:36.089 --> 12:39.492
- HE SAID, "YOU BETTER
BE A GOOD GIRL.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.761
AND BEHAVE."

12:44.264 --> 12:46.533
HE TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD
KILL MY MOM AND DAD

12:46.566 --> 12:50.203
IF I TOLD ANYONE.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.374
AND THEN HE TOOK
MY DRIVER'S PERMIT

12:54.407 --> 12:57.210
SO THAT HE WOULD KNOW MY NAME
AND WHERE I LIVED.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.080
- WHEN WAS THE NEXT ATTACK?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.383
- NOVEMBER 14, 1998.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.453
I WAS A SOPHOMORE AT HUDSON.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.422
HE HELD A KNIFE TO MY THROAT,
AND HE SAID,

13:09.456 --> 13:10.924
"I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.393
YOU'VE BEEN A VERY BAD GIRL."

13:13.426 --> 13:14.928
- HE BROKE INTO YOUR APARTMENT?

13:14.962 --> 13:16.429
- FROM THE FIRE ESCAPE.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.499
[camera clicking]

13:19.532 --> 13:20.433
[voice cracking]
HE TIED ME UP

13:20.467 --> 13:22.102
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
TO GET ON MY KNEES.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.470
[sniffles]

13:23.503 --> 13:25.405
- IT'S OKAY, VICKI.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.474
IT'S OKAY, TAKE YOUR TIME.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.911
- HE RAPED ME
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.080
THE WHOLE TIME, HE JUST
KEPT WHISPERING,

13:33.113 --> 13:34.982
"YOU'RE MINE.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.450
FOREVER."

13:37.484 --> 13:39.452
[sobbing]

13:42.455 --> 13:43.556
- DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.392
- YES.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.493
THEY DID A REPORT,

13:46.526 --> 13:48.161
BUT I DIDN'T
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.498
I JUST WANTED TO FORGET
IT HAD EVER HAPPENED.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.434
UNTIL MY 20TH BIRTHDAY.

13:54.467 --> 13:58.171
I GOT HOME, AND THERE WAS
A PACKAGE WAITING FOR ME.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.540
WHEN I OPENED IT, THERE WAS
A JACK-IN-THE-BOX INSIDE

14:00.573 --> 14:03.210
THAT SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.946
AND THE CARD ATTACHED SAID,
"I'M WATCHING YOU.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.915
BEHAVE YOURSELF."

14:09.482 --> 14:11.051
- HE KNEW
IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY

14:11.084 --> 14:12.285
BECAUSE HE HAD
YOUR DRIVING PERMIT.

14:12.319 --> 14:16.156
- I WAS TOO SCARED
TO TELL THE POLICE.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.425
SO I RAN.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.494
- WHERE DID YOU GO?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.497
- TO LOS ANGELES.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.500
I GOT A JOB.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.069
I MET THIS GUY.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.304
SCOTT.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.407
I LOVED HIM.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.377
WE GOT ENGAGED.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.047
ALL THE NIGHTMARES
WERE OVER UNTIL...

14:40.080 --> 14:44.484
- UNTIL HE FOLLOWED YOU
3,000 MILES AWAY.

14:44.517 --> 14:50.290
- JULY 2000.

14:50.323 --> 14:55.462
ONE WEEK BEFORE MY WEDDING.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.596
I CAME HOME FROM
MY BRIDAL SHOWER,

14:56.629 --> 15:01.101
AND HE WAS WAITING FOR ME.

15:01.134 --> 15:05.973
HE PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE
AND HE BROKE MY NOSE.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.242
[crying] HE SAID THAT
I WAS A BITCH FOR MOVING

15:09.276 --> 15:14.047
WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.583
THEN,
AFTER HE RAPED ME, HE...

15:16.616 --> 15:18.251
HE TOOK MY ENGAGEMENT RING

15:18.285 --> 15:20.087
AND MY CALIFORNIA
DRIVER'S LICENSE,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.421
AND SAID HE WOULD
KEEP IT SAFE.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.056
[sobbing] OW!

15:23.090 --> 15:24.491
PLEASE, YOU'RE HURTING ME.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.564
THE NEIGHBORS, THEY HEARD--

15:31.598 --> 15:37.437
THEY HEARD ME CRYING,
SO THEY CALLED THE POLICE.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.272
THEY DID A RAPE KIT
AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:42.275 --> 15:46.013
I CRIED ALL THE TIME.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.648
I COULDN'T EAT.

15:48.681 --> 15:52.319
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.422
AND SCOTT KEPT ASKING ME
IF I STILL LOVED HIM.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.491
I TOLD HIM OF COURSE I DID,

15:58.525 --> 16:02.362
BUT EVERY TIME HE TOUCHED ME
I JUST THOUGHT OF HIM.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.233
- DID SCOTT LEAVE YOU?

16:06.266 --> 16:07.367
- NO.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.270
I BROKE OFF THE ENGAGEMENT
AND MOVED.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.705
I FOUND A JOB THAT I COULD
DO FROM HOME.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.675
I BECAME A HERMIT.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.311
TILL ONE DAY, I LEFT
TO TALK TO MY BOSS,

16:18.345 --> 16:20.213
AND WHEN I CAME HOME...

16:20.247 --> 16:21.748
- HE WAS THERE.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.516
- NO.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.319
BUT HE HAD BEEN.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.489
MY UNDERWEAR WERE GONE,
AND I JUST FREAKED OUT.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.324
- IS THAT WHEN YOU
CAME BACK TO NEW YORK?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.327
- YES.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.464
- I WAS LIVING
WITH MY MOTHER.

16:37.497 --> 16:41.168
BUT I HAD TO MOVE
SEVEN MONTHS AGO, WHEN SHE DIED.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.371
- TILL HE FOUND YOU AGAIN
LAST NIGHT.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.411
- WHEN I CAME OUT
OF THE SUBWAY...

16:51.444 --> 16:53.046
HE PULLED ME IN--

16:53.080 --> 16:54.447
INTO THE ALLEY.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.288
AND HE...SHOVED ME
FACE FIRST INTO A BRICK WALL

17:01.321 --> 17:03.390
AND RAPED ME.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.592
- VICKI, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY SURE

17:05.625 --> 17:07.527
THAT IT WAS THE SAME MAN?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.762
- I COULDN'T SEE HIM.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.600
BUT HE WHISPERED,
"YOU DIDN'T BEHAVE YOURSELF,

17:13.633 --> 17:16.569
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE."

17:16.603 --> 17:19.372
I STARTED TO SCREAM,
AND HE HIT ME WITH A BOTTLE.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.409
- VICKI, I PROMISE YOU,

17:22.442 --> 17:24.444
HE WILL NEVER HURT YOU AGAIN.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.551
- THIS GUY IS THE ULTIMATE
CONTROL FREAK,

17:31.584 --> 17:33.686
STALKING HER CROSS-COUNTRY
FOR 15 YEARS?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.322
- YEAH, AND HE'S GONNA
KEEP PREYING ON VICKI

17:35.355 --> 17:36.356
UNTIL WE LOCK HIM UP.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.858
- I'LL HAVE PATROL SET UP
A PROTECTIVE DETAIL.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.094
GET THE SKETCH OUT CITYWIDE
TO EVERY POLICE AGENCY

17:41.128 --> 17:42.095
IN THE TRISTATE AREA,

17:42.129 --> 17:43.596
AND LOS ANGELES TOO.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.166
DO WE KNOW WHO CAUGHT HER CASE
IN CALIFORNIA?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.534
- LAPD.
A DETECTIVE OUT THERE

17:47.567 --> 17:49.502
SAYS HE'S PULLING
ANYTHING THAT HE CAN FIND.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.504
- I HOPE HE HAS
BETTER LUCK THAN I DID.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.274
REPORTS FROM VICKI'S
'98 RAPE HERE

17:54.307 --> 17:55.508
GOT LOST WHEN THE THREE-FIVE

17:55.542 --> 17:57.477
MOVED TO THEIR NEW
PRECINCT LAST YEAR.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.280
- SO UNLESS THE PERP'S DNA
IS IN VICKI'S RAPE KIT,

18:00.313 --> 18:01.381
WE GOT NOTHING.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.482
- NOT EXACTLY, CAPTAIN.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.117
WE DO HAVE FLUIDS
FROM THE RAPE KIT.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.818
- VICKI SAID THAT THE PERP
MAY HAVE WORN A CONDOM.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.120
- THIS ISN'T SEMEN.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.422
THIS SAMPLE CONTAINED
GLYCERIN,

18:09.456 --> 18:11.158
LANOLIN, AND MINERAL OIL.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.625
- SOUNDS LIKE A MOISTURIZER.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.794
- I'M THINKING HE USED IT
AS A LUBRICANT.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.463
- HE COULD HAVE
BOUGHT THAT ANYWHERE.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.298
- NOT THIS STUFF.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
[plastic bag crinkling]

18:19.666 --> 18:20.900
- "HEAVENLY TOUCH."

18:20.933 --> 18:22.469
- WE FOUND IT
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.471
UH, PERP MUST HAVE
DROPPED IT WHEN HE RAN.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.473
THAT MOISTURIZER
IS A CHEMICAL MATCH

18:26.506 --> 18:27.574
TO WHAT WAS IN VICKI.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.808
- TELL ME YOU FOUND PRINTS.

18:28.841 --> 18:31.378
- SORRY, BUT CHECK OUT
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.483
- "COURTESY OF...
THE AMSTERDAM."

18:38.885 --> 18:40.787
- WELCOME TO OUR HOTEL.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.489
WHERE CAN I DIRECT YOU?

18:42.522 --> 18:45.492
- TO THIS GUY,
IF YOU'VE SEEN HIM.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.727
- WELL...

18:47.760 --> 18:50.530
THAT COULD BE MR. HARRIS.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.564
- IS HE A GUEST?

18:51.598 --> 18:53.900
- NO, HE ENTERTAINS CLIENTS
HERE ALL THE TIME

18:53.933 --> 18:56.203
IN OUR LOUNGE.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.570
THERE HE IS AT THE BAR.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.939
- AND THE DOCTOR
SAYS THE BEST TRAINING

18:59.972 --> 19:02.575
FOR ROBOTIC SURGERY
IS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.544
[laughter]
- MR. HARRIS.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.846
- OH, PLEASE.
CALL ME BILL.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.448
WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?

19:08.481 --> 19:09.582
- UH, DETECTIVE.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.184
BILL, CAN WE TALK TO YOU
A MINUTE?

19:11.218 --> 19:12.485
- SURE.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.354
GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE
RUN THAT RED LIGHT.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.655
- HMM. YEAH.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.357
NOW, BILL, THIS IS KIND OF
EMBARRASSING,

19:17.390 --> 19:20.560
BUT YOU LOOK AN AWFUL LOT
LIKE A SUSPECT WE'RE AFTER.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.829
- UH, I WAS JUST KIDDING
ABOUT THE RED LIGHT.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.297
- YEAH, WE CAN
CLEAR THIS UP QUICKLY

19:24.331 --> 19:26.533
IF YOU DON'T MIND COMING
DOWN TO OUR OFFICE.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.168
- SURE, I'LL COOPERATE
IN ANY WAY I CAN.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.942
- EVERYBODY LOOK LEFT.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.214
- [whispers] OH, GOD.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.416
- YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.353
- NUMBER THREE.
THAT'S HIM.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.489
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FOUND HIM.
THANK YOU.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.558
- VICKI, JUST TO BE CLEAR.

19:51.591 --> 19:55.762
WHERE DO YOU RECOGNIZE
NUMBER THREE FROM?

19:55.795 --> 19:59.499
- THAT'S THE MAN
THAT RAPED ME FOUR TIMES.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.900
- RAPE? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.570
- OUR VICTIM POSITIVELY
IDENTIFIED YOU.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.005
- IMPOSSIBLE. SHE MUST HAVE
SEEN ME SOMEPLACE BEFORE.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.139
- SHE HAS.

20:07.173 --> 20:12.279
EACH OF THE FOUR TIMES THAT YOU
RAPED HER SINCE 1995.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.481
- 15 YEARS?

20:14.514 --> 20:16.683
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU'RE INSANE.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.319
NOW, I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT,
SO IF WE'RE FINISHED--

20:19.352 --> 20:21.521
- WELL, WE'RE NOT FINISHED,
SO JUST HAVE A SEAT.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.955
HAVE SOME WATER.
RELAX.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.457
- RELAX?
- YEAH.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.692
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RELAX

20:25.725 --> 20:27.494
WHEN YOU THINK
I'M SOME KIND OF A MONSTER?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.429
- OKAY, WELL, THEN,
HELP US OUT.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.264
HOW OFTEN DO YOU STAY
AT THE AMSTERDAM?

20:31.298 --> 20:32.131
- I DON'T.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.467
I LIVE THREE BLOCKS AWAY
ON RIVERSIDE.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.436
- WELL, THE MEN'S ROOM...

20:36.469 --> 20:39.406
HAVE THESE LITTLE BOTTLES
OF MOISTURIZER.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.673
YOU EVER USE IT?

20:40.707 --> 20:42.442
- NO. DO I NEED IT?

20:42.475 --> 20:43.843
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.680
- LOOK...

20:47.714 --> 20:50.483
YOU DEFINITELY
HAVE THE WRONG GUY.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.520
- BILL, WHAT DO YOU
DO FOR WORK?

20:53.553 --> 20:54.554
- I'M A PRODUCT REP.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.456
SURGICAL EQUIPMENT.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.524
- SCALPELS, CLAMPS,
STUFF LIKE THAT?

20:57.557 --> 20:58.791
- HIGHER END.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.360
ROBOTIC SCALPELS.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.193
LAPAROSCOPIC CAMERAS.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.529
- SO WHERE WERE YOU
TWO NIGHTS AGO?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.830
- PROVIDENCE, AT A TRADE SHOW.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.298
I GOT BACK YESTERDAY.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.633
- CAN YOU PROVE IT?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.735
- IN MY BRIEFCASE
BY YOUR DESK,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.970
I HAVE A BILL
FOR THE HOTEL.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.473
- TIMESTAMP'S 10:43 A.M.
YESTERDAY MORNING.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.041
- DESK CLERK CONFIRMED IT?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.509
- IT SAID HARRIS'S
ONLY COMPLAINT

21:16.543 --> 21:18.511
WAS HE DIDN'T GET A MINT
ON HIS PILLOW.

21:18.545 --> 21:21.080
HE TOOK
THE 11:52 A.M. AMTRAK

21:21.113 --> 21:22.915
FROM PROVIDENCE
TO PENN STATION.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.951
- HOW ABOUT THE NIGHT BEFORE,
WHEN VICKI WAS RAPED?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.486
- I PULLED THESE STILLS
OFF THE SECURITY VIDEO

21:26.519 --> 21:28.087
THE HOTEL EMAILED ME.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.622
HERE HE IS,
CHECKING INTO THE HOTEL

21:29.656 --> 21:32.024
TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

21:32.058 --> 21:35.428
AND HERE HE IS LEAVING,
QUARTER TO 11, WEDNESDAY.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.498
SECURITY SAID HE NEVER
LEFT THE ROOM ALL NIGHT.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.099
- SO VICKI WAS WRONG.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.034
- HER DESCRIPTION
FITS HARRIS TO A TEE.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.837
- YEAH, AND ABOUT
A MILLION OTHER WHITE GUYS.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.539
CHECK BACK WITH THE AMSTERDAM,

21:46.573 --> 21:48.741
SHOW THAT SKETCH
TO EVERY EMPLOYEE.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.678
- SHE WAS SURE.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.546
- LIV, SHE WAS TRAUMATIZED.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.947
YOU KNOW, SHE--

21:54.981 --> 21:58.017
SHE MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.719
- NO, IT'S NOT A MISTAKE.
THAT'S HIM.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.388
- VICKI, IT CAN'T BE.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.422
- THAT ANIMAL RAPED ME
FOUR TIMES!

22:02.455 --> 22:04.023
DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.692
- HE WAS IN RHODE ISLAND
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.060
- NO! NO, YOU CANNOT
JUST LET HIM WALK OUT OF HERE!

22:08.094 --> 22:09.562
- WE HAVE NOTHING
TO HOLD HIM ON.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.398
- HE'S GONNA FIND ME
AND HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.700
- VICKI!
- I'M SORRY!

22:13.733 --> 22:15.602
I'M SORRY! PLEASE!
PLEASE!

22:15.635 --> 22:18.004
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
PLEASE, I SWEAR TO GOD!

22:18.037 --> 22:20.106
THEY MADE ME TELL THEM
IT WAS YOU. I'M SORRY, PLEASE!

22:20.139 --> 22:22.875
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK I AM!

22:22.909 --> 22:24.577
[overlapping shouting]
- IT'S NOT HIM!

22:24.611 --> 22:26.679
- PLEASE!
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

22:26.713 --> 22:28.415
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

22:28.448 --> 22:29.416
PLEASE!

22:29.449 --> 22:30.917
[sobbing] PLEASE.

22:30.950 --> 22:31.951
PLEASE.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.052
[hyperventilating]

22:33.085 --> 22:34.587
- VICKI, CALM DOWN.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.830
[typing on
computer keyboard]

22:47.066 --> 22:48.901
- YOU HERE ALL NIGHT?

22:48.935 --> 22:51.037
- MANAGED TO GET
A COUPLE HOURS IN THE CRIB.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.672
OHH, THANK YOU.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.973
- HOW'S VICKI?

22:54.006 --> 22:57.910
- SHE'S SCARED TO DEATH.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.580
PATROL'S PARKED
OUTSIDE HER PLACE.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.583
- LIV, HARRIS'S ALIBI
IS SOLID.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.785
- ELLIOT, YOU SAW HER
IN THE HALLWAY.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.787
SHE'S POSITIVE
THAT IT WAS HIM,

23:07.820 --> 23:08.755
AND MY GUT TELLS ME
SHE'S RIGHT.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.424
- OKAY, SO WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
TO BACK THAT UP?

23:11.458 --> 23:12.892
- NOT MUCH.

23:12.925 --> 23:16.463
HE'S A PRODUCT REP FOR
QUALITAS SURGICAL FOR 22 YEARS.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.898
HE'S GOT A DOZEN
COMMUNITY AWARDS.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.733
BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.902
HE LIVES ALONE.
HE HAS NO KIDS.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.637
PROBLEM WITH WOMEN?

23:24.671 --> 23:25.772
- OR COMMITMENT OR HE'S GAY.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.674
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM A RAPIST.

23:30.843 --> 23:31.944
- THIS MIGHT.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.647
THE DESK CLERK FROM PROVIDENCE
JUST EMAILED ME BACK.

23:34.681 --> 23:37.149
I TOLD HIM TO GO OVER EVERY INCH
OF HARRIS'S HOTEL ROOM.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.585
- WHAT'D HE FIND?

23:38.618 --> 23:40.987
- MR. HARRIS HAD
TAKEN APART A WINDOW

23:41.020 --> 23:42.655
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T
OPEN ALL THE WAY.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.558
- YEAH, HOTELS DO THAT
SO CUSTOMERS DON'T JUMP.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.894
- OR SO LOWLIFES
CAN'T CREEP OUT.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.530
HIS ROOM IS ON
THE FIRST FLOOR.

23:50.563 --> 23:52.965
- YOU'RE SURE
HE LEFT THE HOTEL?

23:52.999 --> 23:54.801
HE ORDERED TWO MOVIES
AND ROOM SERVICE

23:54.834 --> 23:56.503
THE NIGHT VICKI WAS RAPED.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.970
- GREAT ALIBI--
TWO FLICKS AND A DINNER

23:58.004 --> 23:59.572
MAKES IT LOOK LIKE
HE'S IN FOR THE NIGHT.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.874
- WHILE HE WAS REALLY
DRIVING TO MANHATTAN.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.844
HARRIS RENTED A 2010 TAURUS

24:04.877 --> 24:06.479
TEN MINUTES BEFORE
HE CHECKED INTO THE HOTEL.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.714
- AND RETURNED IT WHEN?

24:07.747 --> 24:09.816
- 9:38 A.M.
THE NEXT MORNING.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.519
- SO YOU'RE SAYING HARRIS
DROVE DOWN TO MANHATTAN

24:12.552 --> 24:13.820
TO RAPE VICKI SAYERS

24:13.853 --> 24:15.588
AND AVOIDED THE HOTEL
SECURITY CAMERAS

24:15.622 --> 24:18.124
BY SLITHERING
IN AND OUT OF THE WINDOW?

24:18.157 --> 24:18.958
- LIKE THE SNAKE THAT HE IS.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.995
NOW THIS...
IS THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE

24:23.029 --> 24:25.565
FROM HARRIS'S HOTEL ROOM

24:25.598 --> 24:26.999
TO THE ALLEY

24:27.033 --> 24:28.234
WHERE VICKI WAS ATTACKED.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.002
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THAT ROUTE WOULD TAKE HIM

24:30.036 --> 24:32.705
THROUGH THE LARCHMONT TOLLS
ON 95.

24:32.739 --> 24:33.806
WE'D HAVE TO HAVE HIM
ON VIDEO.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.509
- UNLESS HE GOT ONTO THE 287
ONCE HE LEFT CONNECTICUT

24:36.543 --> 24:37.910
AND TOOK BROADWAY
INTO MANHATTAN.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.746
HE WOULDN'T HIT ONE TOLL.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.047
- THAT'S CONJECTURE,
NOT PROOF.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.250
- OKAY, THE MAPPING PROGRAM
CALCULATES

24:44.283 --> 24:47.086
THIS ROUTE AT 173 MILES--
THAT'S ONE WAY.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.756
THAT MAKES IT 346 ROUNDTRIP.

24:49.789 --> 24:53.059
HARRIS PUT 349.8 MILES
ON THAT RENTAL.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.795
- THAT'S EXACTLY ENOUGH
TO MAKE THE TRIP

24:55.828 --> 24:57.063
AND RETURN THE CAR, CAPTAIN.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.065
THAT SON OF A BITCH
RAPED VICKI.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.600
- HE GOES TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
TO COVER HIS TRACKS.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.301
HE THINKS
HE'S MADE OF TEFLON.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.872
- WELL, LET'S FIND A WAY
TO MAKE SOMETHING STICK.

25:05.905 --> 25:06.939
- YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT?

25:06.973 --> 25:09.075
- STOP HIDING.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.743
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE FREE

25:10.777 --> 25:13.212
UNTIL YOU START
LIVING YOUR LIFE.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.781
- I CAN'T.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.850
- YOU CAN'T LET HARRIS
CONTROL YOU ANYMORE.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.586
- NOW THIS IS MY FAULT?

25:19.619 --> 25:23.255
- IT'S--IT'S NEVER
A VICTIM'S FAULT.

25:23.289 --> 25:26.559
RAPISTS HAVE A SICK NEED
TO FEEL POWERFUL.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.928
NOW, THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP HARRIS

25:28.961 --> 25:30.963
IS TO TAKE THAT POWER AWAY.

25:30.997 --> 25:34.266
- HE WILL KILL ME.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.102
- VICKI, IF I HAVE
TO LIVE WITH YOU

25:36.135 --> 25:38.070
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS,

25:38.104 --> 25:41.908
I PROMISE YOU, HE'S NEVER
GONNA TOUCH YOU AGAIN.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.887
- WHAT DO I DO?

25:54.921 --> 25:56.989
- WE...

25:57.023 --> 26:00.059
ARE GONNA GIVE HIM A TASTE
OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

26:03.863 --> 26:07.166
- HEY, BILL.
YOU BEHAVING YOURSELF?

26:14.807 --> 26:16.142
- GOING MY WAY, BILLY?

26:23.683 --> 26:26.986
- THINK THE KNICKS
GOT A CHANCE THIS YEAR?

26:27.019 --> 26:28.054
[zipper zips]

26:28.087 --> 26:30.122
- GO TO HELL.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.858
- HEY, AREN'T YOU GONNA
WASH YOUR HANDS?

26:31.891 --> 26:32.792
[door slams]

26:32.825 --> 26:35.728
- AS YOU CAN SEE,
OUR SYSTEM IS VERSATILE,

26:35.762 --> 26:37.697
DURABLE, AND BEST OF ALL,
WON'T BREAK THE BANK.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.865
ANY QUESTIONS?

26:38.898 --> 26:41.634
- YEAH, WHY DID YOU
RAPE VICKI?

26:41.668 --> 26:42.769
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

26:42.802 --> 26:44.904
- I ASKED HIM
WHY HE RAPED VICKI.

26:44.937 --> 26:45.938
- WHO'S VICKI?

26:45.972 --> 26:47.206
- SOMEONE CALL SECURITY!

26:47.239 --> 26:49.041
- THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT.
NYPD.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.010
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.680
WHY DID YOU RAPE THAT WOMAN?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.816
- EXCUSE ME.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.184
- KEEP OUR CITY SAFE.

26:58.217 --> 27:01.420
POLICE, TAKE ONE.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.924
POLICE, TAKE ONE.

27:04.957 --> 27:05.858
- GIVE ME THAT!

27:05.892 --> 27:07.860
- POLICE, TAKE ONE.
KEEP OUR CITY SAFE.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.261
- WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

27:09.295 --> 27:10.930
- PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHEN THERE'S SLIME

27:10.963 --> 27:12.231
STINKING UP
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.800
POLICE.
- THIS IS ILLEGAL!

27:13.833 --> 27:15.101
- YEAH, CALL A COP.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.169
POLICE, TAKE ONE.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.841
- [laughs] AND THAT'S
A TRUE STORY.

27:21.874 --> 27:22.842
[spoon clanging on glass]

27:22.875 --> 27:23.642
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

27:23.676 --> 27:25.211
CAN I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

27:25.244 --> 27:26.946
- DO YOU SEE THAT MAN?

27:26.979 --> 27:28.414
YES, HIM.

27:28.447 --> 27:32.719
HE'S STALKED ME AND RAPED ME
FOUR TIMES SINCE I WAS 16!

27:32.752 --> 27:35.955
- I-I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.925
CLEARLY, THIS WOMAN
IS MISTAKING ME

27:38.958 --> 27:40.960
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

27:40.993 --> 27:44.964
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
PRIVATELY?

27:44.997 --> 27:47.800
I WANT HER ARRESTED
FOR SLANDER.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.301
- IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A LIE
FOR IT TO BE SLANDER.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.037
- THEN I'LL SUE HER
FOR HARASSMENT.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.905
I'LL SUE THE NYPD--
- GO AHEAD.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.473
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.843
AND EVERYONE ON THAT JURY'S
GONNA FIND OUT THE SICK,

27:56.876 --> 27:58.811
DERANGED THINGS
THAT YOU DID TO HER.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.981
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
- YOU WANNA MAKE A BET?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.282
AND EVERY TIME YOU LOOK
OVER YOUR SHOULDER,

28:03.315 --> 28:05.017
YOU'RE GONNA WONDER...

28:05.051 --> 28:07.019
ARE THEY FOLLOWING ME?

28:07.053 --> 28:09.455
- GET OUT OF MY FACE.

28:09.488 --> 28:12.158
- YOU'RE MY BITCH NOW.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.964
- YOU'RE ALL ALIKE.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.967
EVERY ONE OF YOU.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.835
- COME ON, VICKI.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.837
WE'RE DONE HERE.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.806
- YOU'RE SCREWING
WITH THE WRONG GUY!

28:26.839 --> 28:28.040
- WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.876
HE DIDN'T SLIP.
YOU SAID HE WAS GONNA SLIP.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.110
- HE JUST DID.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.112
- VICKI WASN'T HARRIS'S
ONLY VICTIM.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.246
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.448
- HE SAID, "YOU'RE ALL THE SAME,
EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU."

28:36.482 --> 28:37.984
ANYONE THAT HATES WOMEN
THAT MUCH

28:38.017 --> 28:39.151
CAN'T JUST STOP AT ONE.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.387
- NOW, HARRIS HITS THE ROAD
A COUPLE TIMES EACH YEAR--

28:41.420 --> 28:44.323
YOU KNOW, TRADE SHOWS,
HOSPITALS.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.193
HE'S GOT HIS CORPORATE
HEADQUARTERS IN LOS ANGELES.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.261
SO WE SUBPOENAED
HIS FREQUENT FLYER ACCOUNTS.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.097
COMPARED HIS TRAVEL DATES
WITH ATTACKS

28:51.130 --> 28:53.900
IN THE CITIES
HE VISITED.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.868
- AND WE FOUND TEN RAPES

28:55.902 --> 28:57.870
WITH THE SAME M.O.

28:57.904 --> 29:01.373
L.A., DETROIT, BIRMINGHAM,
CHICAGO, HOUSTON,

29:01.407 --> 29:03.375
SAN ANTONIO, ALBUQUERQUE,

29:03.409 --> 29:05.912
PHOENIX, OAKLAND,
AND SAN DIEGO.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.914
- DO WE KNOW HOW
HE CHOOSES HIS VICTIMS?

29:07.947 --> 29:09.982
- HE HUNTS THEM
IN HIS COMFORT ZONE.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.217
HOSPITALS.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.452
- FOUR NURSES, TWO DOCTORS,

29:13.485 --> 29:14.887
AN ADMINISTRATOR,

29:14.921 --> 29:16.055
A PHARMACIST,

29:16.088 --> 29:17.890
AND EVEN A PATIENT.

29:17.924 --> 29:21.961
- PLUS ONE CANDY STRIPER
BACK IN 1995.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.395
- AND, LIKE, VICKI,
HE STALKS THEM,

29:23.429 --> 29:26.933
THEN HE RAPES THEM MULTIPLE
TIMES TO KEEP THEM IN LINE.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.368
- HARRIS HAS BEEN TERRORIZING
WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY

29:29.401 --> 29:31.303
FOR 20 YEARS.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.112
- WILLIAM HARRIS RAPED
HOW MANY WOMEN?

29:40.146 --> 29:41.914
- 11, INCLUDING VICKI SAYERS.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.249
- DID ANY OF THEM I.D. HIM?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.451
- VICKI'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT WE'VE INTERVIEWED.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.253
- SO YOU'RE GOING OFF ONE HELL
OF A CRAZY THEORY.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.955
- NO, VICKI PICKED HIM
OUT OF A LINEUP.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.322
THAT'S ENOUGH TO ARREST HIM.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.958
- IF SHE'D SEEN HIS FACE
DURING THE LAST ATTACK.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.125
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE DIDN'T.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.961
- SHERRI, THIS SICKO

29:54.994 --> 29:57.830
HAS TERRORIZED WOMEN IN ALMOST
A DOZEN STATES.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.099
- AND SHE WAS DISORIENTED
FROM A BASH IN THE HEAD.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.368
HARRIS'S DEFENSE
WILL RIP HER TO SHREDS.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.071
- SO CHARGE HIM WITH RAPING
VICKI BACK IN '98.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.305
- I CAN'T.

30:06.338 --> 30:07.940
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
RAN OUT IN 2000.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.508
- NEW YORK STATE DROPPED
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

30:09.541 --> 30:10.843
ON RAPE IN '06.

30:10.877 --> 30:11.944
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.946
RAPES BEFORE 2001
ARE OFF-LIMITS.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.147
- OHH.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.215
- LOOK, I REALLY
WANT TO HELP YOU,

30:16.248 --> 30:17.316
BUT ALL YOU GOT
IS A RENTAL CAR

30:17.349 --> 30:20.186
YOU THINK HARRIS DROVE
FROM PROVIDENCE TO THE CITY.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.124
- WHAT ABOUT DNA?

30:25.157 --> 30:27.059
- WE DON'T HAVE DNA.
- YES, WE DO.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.327
FROM HARRIS'S
OTHER VICTIMS...

30:28.360 --> 30:31.397
WHO WERE RAPED THE SAME WAY
VICKI WAS.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.400
- I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET THOSE RAPES IN

30:34.433 --> 30:35.567
AS PRIOR, UNCHARGED CRIMES.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.404
- AND USE THEM TO PROVE
HARRIS'S I.D.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.407
I THINK YOU HAVE
SOME CALLS TO MAKE.

30:41.440 --> 30:45.377
- NO, IF I HAD DNA,
I WOULDN'T BE CALLING YOU.

30:45.411 --> 30:48.047
OKAY, THANK YOU.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.348
- WHO WAS THAT?

30:49.381 --> 30:50.516
- DETECTIVE IN HOUSTON.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.284
THEY HAVE A BACKLOG
OF 4,000 RAPE KITS.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.554
HE SAYS HE'LL GET ME
THE RESULTS WHEN HE HAS THEM.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.925
BIRMINGHAM,
MORE THAN 2,000 RAPE KITS.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.961
PHOENIX HAS 4,100
UNTESTED RAPE KITS.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.362
- ANY YESES?

31:03.395 --> 31:05.264
- DETROIT, CHICAGO, L.A.,

31:05.297 --> 31:08.367
ALL SAY THAT THEY HAVE VICTIMS
THAT MATCH HARRIS'S M.O.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.305
- AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH UNTIL
THEY TRACK DOWN THOSE RAPE KITS.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.341
- I'M GONNA GO
GIVE 'EM A HAND.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.378
- SO WHO'S OUR VICTIM?

31:19.411 --> 31:20.346
- NAME'S DANIELLE TAYLOR.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.682
RAPED TWICE BY THE SAME PERP
IN '99 AND '03.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.284
- WELL, DNA FROM HER RAPE KIT

31:25.317 --> 31:27.053
SHOULD PROVE THAT
IT IS WILLIAM HARRIS.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.054
WE HAVE HIM IN DETROIT

31:28.087 --> 31:29.321
WHEN BOTH ATTACKS OCCURRED.

31:29.355 --> 31:32.424
- THE KIT'S IN HERE.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.459
- YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.194
- SEE ME LAUGHING?

31:35.227 --> 31:38.364
WE'VE COUNTED
ALMOST 7,000 KITS.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.266
WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE
AS MANY AS 16,000 KITS HERE.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.934
- HAVE ANY OF THEM
BEEN TESTED?

31:41.968 --> 31:43.335
- SO FAR ONLY ABOUT 1,200.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.371
OUR LAB WAS SO SCREWED UP,
THE POWERS THAT BE

31:45.404 --> 31:47.673
SHUT IT DOWN
TWO YEARS AGO.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.142
STATE LAB DOES OUR CASES NOW,
BUT...

31:50.176 --> 31:51.310
THEY DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY OR THE EYEBALLS

31:51.343 --> 31:53.579
TO GET THROUGH THIS MESS.

31:53.612 --> 31:56.182
- SO...WHAT HAPPENED
TO MS. TAYLOR?

31:56.215 --> 31:57.416
- UP AND LEFT TOWN.

31:57.449 --> 32:01.353
LEFT NO FORWARDING ADDRESS.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.023
PAPERWORK SAYS HER KIT
OUGHT TO BE RIGHT HERE.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.124
'COURSE,
THAT DON'T MEAN MUCH.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.293
- COULD IT BE ANYWHERE ELSE?

32:07.326 --> 32:08.427
- ONLY OTHER PLACE WOULD BE

32:08.460 --> 32:10.129
THE PRECINCT WHERE
THE RAPES OCCURRED.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.263
- WELL, GREAT.
LET'S GO THERE.

32:11.297 --> 32:14.133
- CITY BOARDED UP THE PRECINCT
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.235
IT BURNT TO THE GROUND
LAST MONTH.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.138
MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE
BETTER LUCK IN CHICAGO.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.639
- WE GOT LUCKY.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.174
FOR ONCE, THESE THINGS

32:22.208 --> 32:23.642
WERE RIGHT WHERE THE PAPERWORK
SAID THEY SHOULD BE.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.644
- SO WHY WEREN'T THEY
SENT FOR TESTING?

32:25.677 --> 32:27.579
- WELL, FIRST ATTACK
WAS IN '97.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.548
THE DETECTIVE TOLD THE VICTIM
EVEN IF HE SENT IT,

32:29.581 --> 32:31.183
THE LAB WOULDN'T
GET TO IT FOR A YEAR,

32:31.217 --> 32:33.319
AND SHE SHOULD TRY
TO PUT THE RAPE BEHIND HER.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.254
SECOND ATTACK WAS IN 2001.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.524
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.426
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.328
THE SEAL'S BEEN BROKEN.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.496
IT'S EMPTY!

32:44.530 --> 32:46.565
NO WONDER IT WAS SO LIGHT.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.368
- THIS ONE HAS MOLD
ALL OVER IT.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.203
[cell phone ringing]
DNA'S GOT TO BE CONTAMINATED.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.338
- I'M SORRY YOU CAME
ALL THIS WAY

32:52.371 --> 32:56.042
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.210
- MAYBE IT WASN'T.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.545
LAPD JUST HIT
THE JACKPOT

32:59.578 --> 33:02.414
ON MY VICTIM'S
PREVIOUS RAPE.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.750
- REX WINTERS.
- OLIVIA BENSON.

33:04.783 --> 33:07.219
- HI.
- SO...VICKI'S RAPE KIT.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.521
- LAB'S STILL PROCESSING
THE DNA.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.490
- WHY'D IT TAKE SO LONG
TO TEST IT?

33:11.523 --> 33:14.360
- 'CAUSE WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF
KITS SITTING IN THE FREEZER.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.494
HOW BAD'S YOUR BACKLOG?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.229
- WE DON'T HAVE ONE.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.564
EVERY KIT IS TESTED
AFTER AN ASSAULT,

33:18.597 --> 33:20.266
AND THE RESULTS ARE FORWARDED
BACK TO US

33:20.299 --> 33:22.234
AND TO THE D.A.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.235
SO HOW LONG TILL WE GET
VICKI'S RESULTS?

33:23.269 --> 33:26.138
- I'M NOT SURE,
BUT I DO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE.

33:26.172 --> 33:28.074
WILLIAM HARRIS RENTS
A STORAGE LOCKER

33:28.107 --> 33:29.208
IN BOYLE HEIGHTS.

33:29.241 --> 33:33.645
- THE COMPANY HE WORKS FOR
IS HEADQUARTERED OUT HERE.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.281
BUT WHY DOES
HE NEED A LOCKER?

33:35.314 --> 33:36.382
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.684
BUT HE'S HAD IT
SINCE AUGUST 2000.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.719
- THAT'S RIGHT AFTER
VICKI WAS RAPED.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.588
- HOW FAST CAN YOU
GET A WARRANT?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.346
- IT'S HIS SAFE PLACE.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.747
WHEN HE'S HERE ON BUSINESS,

34:08.780 --> 34:10.482
HE DROPS IN TO GET OFF.

34:10.516 --> 34:16.288
- 3,000 MILES AWAY
FROM WHERE HE LIVES.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.190
HEY.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.298
- SARAH MILLER, SAN DIEGO.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.834
JAMIE CLARK, HOUSTON.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.637
SUSAN DENNING, BIRMINGHAM.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.307
JOSIE FRANKLIN, OAKLAND.

34:35.341 --> 34:38.310
AND HERE'S VICKI.

34:38.344 --> 34:42.281
HE EVEN PUT THE DATES IN
OF WHEN HE ATTACKED HER.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.616
- THESE BOXES ARE DATED TOO.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.286
MUST BE THEIR CLOTHES.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.495
- HE'S GOT HOME MOVIES.

35:01.533 --> 35:02.834
OH, MY GOD.

35:02.868 --> 35:03.869
THAT'S VICKI.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.708
HE'S BEEN FILMING HER
FOR YEARS.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.362
- BENSON!

35:30.396 --> 35:32.831
OKAY.
OKAY, THANKS.

35:32.864 --> 35:33.865
- NOW WHAT?

35:33.899 --> 35:34.833
- THAT WAS THE LAB.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.436
THE DNA FROM VICKI'S RAPE KIT
IS DEGRADED.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.605
- OH, I CAN'T CATCH A BREAK.
- BUT...

35:39.638 --> 35:40.939
THE TECH'S WILLING
TO TESTIFY

35:40.972 --> 35:41.873
HE'S GOT ENOUGH
MATCHING ALLELES

35:41.907 --> 35:45.211
TO I.D. WILLIAM HARRIS.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.246
- I'M GONNA COLLAR
THIS GUY'S ASS,

35:47.279 --> 35:49.248
AND THEN I'M GONNA SEND IT
TO YOU ON A SILVER PLATTER.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.250
- [chuckles] IT'S YOURS.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.751
CALIFORNIA HAS A TEN-YEAR
STATUTE.

35:52.784 --> 35:56.255
CLOCK RAN OUT ON VICKI'S RAPE
THREE WEEKS AGO.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.524
- YOU KNEW ALL ALONG THAT YOU
COULDN'T PROSECUTE HARRIS?

35:58.557 --> 36:00.692
- BUT I KNEW YOU COULD.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.794
GO GET THE PRICK.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.798
- THIS IS JUST ONE

36:06.832 --> 36:08.867
OF THE MANY VIDEOS
OF VICKI SAYERS

36:08.900 --> 36:11.470
DISCOVERED INSIDE
THE DEFENDANT'S STORAGE LOCKER

36:11.503 --> 36:15.841
IN LOS ANGELES
BY DETECTIVE BENSON.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.910
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS VIDEO
BEFORE, VICKI?

36:18.944 --> 36:20.612
- NO, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.

36:20.646 --> 36:23.882
- AND DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THAT YOUNG LADY?

36:23.915 --> 36:25.684
- YES, THAT'S ME.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.654
- VICKI, IS THE MAN
WHO RAPED YOU IN THE ALLEY

36:28.687 --> 36:30.656
THE SAME MAN WHO RAPED YOU
TEN YEARS AGO

36:30.689 --> 36:31.990
IN LOS ANGELES?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.493
- YES.
AND IT'S HIM.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.696
- LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT
THE WITNESS HAS IDENTIFIED

36:37.729 --> 36:39.598
THE DEFENDANT,
WILLIAM HARRIS.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.267
I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.938
- I'M SORRY FOR YOU'VE ENDURED,
MS. AYERS.

36:46.972 --> 36:50.309
BUT YOU'VE TESTIFIED THAT
IN THE FIRST THREE ATTACKS,

36:50.342 --> 36:51.843
YOU SAW THE PERPETRATOR.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.712
- YES, HIM.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.282
- DID YOU SEE YOUR ATTACKER'S
FACE THIS LAST TIME?

36:56.315 --> 36:58.650
- NO, I DIDN'T.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.919
- SO YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
SEE THE MAN WHO RAPED YOU

37:00.952 --> 37:02.854
IN THAT ALLEY?
- NO, BUT I HEARD HIM.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.923
HE WHISPERED,
"YOU DIDN'T BEHAVE."

37:04.956 --> 37:06.925
- WE'VE ALSO HEARD TESTIMONY

37:06.958 --> 37:09.928
THAT THE DNA FROM YOUR ASSAULT
IN CALIFORNIA

37:09.961 --> 37:11.597
IS NOT AN EXACT MATCH.

37:11.630 --> 37:15.434
AND YOU DIDN'T SEE
YOUR ALLEGED RAPIST.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.704
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
YOU MADE A MISTAKE?

37:18.737 --> 37:21.640
- EVERY DAY FOR 15 YEARS,

37:21.673 --> 37:24.943
I HAVE FEARED FOR MY LIFE.

37:24.976 --> 37:28.947
EVERY TIME I LEAVE MY HOUSE,
I'M AFRAID HE'S GONNA ATTACK ME.

37:28.980 --> 37:32.050
EVERY NIGHT IS THE NIGHT
THAT HE'S COMING BACK.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.587
EVERY SHADOW IS WHERE
HE'S HIDING.

37:35.621 --> 37:39.057
EVERY NIGHTMARE
IS ABOUT HIM.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.892
AS SURE
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE,

37:40.926 --> 37:45.864
WILLIAM HARRIS IS THE MAN
WHO RAPED ME IN THAT ALLEY.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.300
- I KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.901
NOTHING FURTHER.

37:51.437 --> 37:57.075
- YOU MAY STEP DOWN,
MS. AYERS.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.812
- THE PEOPLE REST,
YOUR HONOR.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.582
- THIS HEARING IS TO DETERMINE
WHETHER EVIDENCE

38:03.615 --> 38:05.751
OF AN UNCHARGED CRIME
FROM ANOTHER STATE

38:05.784 --> 38:08.086
CAN BE USED HERE

38:08.119 --> 38:12.758
TO IDENTIFY THE DEFENDANT
AS MS. SAYERS' RAPIST.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.327
IT IS A TRAVESTY
THAT THE EVIDENCE

38:15.361 --> 38:18.564
WHICH COULD PROVE WILLIAM HARRIS
RAPED VICKI SAYERS

38:18.597 --> 38:22.033
SAT UNTESTED
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.035
UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.671
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.640
BUT ONCE THE EVIDENCE
WAS FINALLY TESTED,

38:28.674 --> 38:30.909
TOO MUCH TIME HAD PASSED.

38:30.942 --> 38:34.946
SO THE DNA HAD BECOME
SIGNIFICANTLY DEGRADED.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.115
AND BECAUSE THE SAMPLE WAS
STORED IN CALIFORNIA,

38:37.148 --> 38:38.717
THE PEOPLE CAN'T PROVE

38:38.750 --> 38:41.420
THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY
WAS PRESERVED.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.490
THEREFORE I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO RULE THE DNA

38:44.523 --> 38:47.626
INSUFFICIENT TO CORROBORATE
MS. SAYERS IDENTIFICATION

38:47.659 --> 38:50.796
OF MR. HARRIS.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.064
I AM VERY SORRY,
BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE.

38:53.098 --> 38:56.001
THIS CASE IS DISMISSED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

38:56.034 --> 39:00.406
THE PEOPLE CAN REFILE CHARGES
IF NEW EVIDENCE IS UNCOVERED.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.574
WE ARE ADJOURNED.

39:02.608 --> 39:03.742
- HOW CAN SHE DO THAT?

39:03.775 --> 39:05.043
- WE'LL GET HIM, VICKI.
I PROMISE.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.980
- JUST STOP MAKING PROMISES
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.716
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET HIM.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.084
I WAS STUPID TO THINK THAT
THERE'D EVER BE ANY JUSTICE.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.620
- VICKI...

39:17.088 --> 39:19.658
[door slams]

39:19.691 --> 39:21.126
[sighs]

39:25.497 --> 39:28.467
- THE FBI's TAKEN OVER
HARRIS'S CASE.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.469
I ALREADY GAVE THEM ALL
THE VICTIMS' DRIVER'S LICENSES.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.738
THEY'LL BE COMING BACK LATER
FOR THE REST.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.940
- I WONDER HOW MANY GUYS LIKE
HARRIS COULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED

39:34.973 --> 39:37.008
IF THOSE RAPE KITS
HAD BEEN TESTED.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.711
- WELL, UNTIL THEY ARE,

39:39.745 --> 39:42.047
EVERYONE IS JUST A VICTIM
WHO'S NEVER GONNA SEE JUSTICE.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.450
- IT'S LIKE WE'RE TELLING THEM
THAT THEY DON'T MATTER

39:44.483 --> 39:48.754
AND WE'RE TELLING THE PERPS
THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.626
OH, MY GOD.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.027
- WHAT?

39:56.061 --> 39:58.163
- WE MAY HAVE HAD HIM
ALL ALONG.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.975
- VICKI!

40:10.008 --> 40:11.777
VICKI! OPEN THE DOOR!
[ringing buzzer]

40:11.810 --> 40:13.812
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.549
- WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW?

40:17.583 --> 40:18.950
- I NEED TO ASK YOU...

40:18.984 --> 40:21.620
ABOUT WHEN HARRIS ATTACKED YOU
IN 1998.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.122
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN?

40:24.155 --> 40:27.826
- HOW LONG DID HE STAY?

40:27.859 --> 40:28.827
- WHY?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.729
- JUST TELL ME.

40:30.762 --> 40:34.566
HOW LONG DID HARRIS STAY?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.201
- ALL NIGHT
AND INTO THE NEXT DAY.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.703
- DID HE FORCE YOU
AGAINST YOUR WILL?

40:37.736 --> 40:39.971
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
HE TIED ME UP.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.973
- WITH WHAT?

40:42.007 --> 40:45.477
WHAT DID HE TIE YOU UP WITH?

40:45.511 --> 40:47.245
- DUCT TAPE.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.081
HE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE IT OFF...
BEFORE HE LEFT.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.850
IT TOOK HOURS FOR ME
TO BREAK FREE

40:51.883 --> 40:53.752
AND CALL THE POLICE.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.121
- VICKI, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT DUCT TAPE?

40:56.154 --> 40:58.023
- YES.

40:58.056 --> 41:01.126
YES, THE POLICE OFFICERS,
THEY PUT IT IN A BAG.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.628
THEY SAID THAT THEY
WERE GONNA KEEP IT

41:02.661 --> 41:04.930
IN CASE THE DETECTIVES
EVER FOUND A SUSPECT.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.665
BUT NOBODY EVER CALLED ME.

41:06.698 --> 41:10.769
- BECAUSE...YOUR
POLICE REPORT GOT LOST.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.037
WE NEVER KNEW IT WAS THERE.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.843
- I HAVE TO GO TO SEATTLE
AND PORTLAND NEXT WEEK,

41:17.876 --> 41:20.111
BUT I'LL BE BACK
FRIDAY NIGHT.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.547
WHEN CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN?

41:21.580 --> 41:23.982
[handcuff snaps]
- IN ABOUT 25 YEARS.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.951
- I HAVEN'T GONE NEAR
THAT WOMAN!

41:25.984 --> 41:28.153
- WILLIAM HARRIS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.856
- WHAT THE HELL FOR THIS TIME?

41:30.889 --> 41:32.257
- KIDNAPPING
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.125
- I DIDN'T KIDNAP HER.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.226
- YEAH, YOU DID.
WHEN YOU RAPED HER IN '98.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.828
- YOU HELD HER HOSTAGE
IN HER APARTMENT

41:36.862 --> 41:38.129
FOR MORE THAN 12 HOURS.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.599
AND WE HAVE THE DUCT TAPE
TO PROVE IT.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.536
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
- WELL, YEAH, WE CAN.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.672
AND WE ARE.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.107
SEE, THERE'S NO STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS ON KIDNAPPING.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.109
- VICKI, PLEASE TELL THEM
THEY'RE WRONG.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.944
YOU KNOW IT WASN'T RAPE.
I LOVE YOU.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.747
I LO--UH, I LOVE YOU!

41:59.651 --> 42:02.654
- NOW I'LL ALWAYS KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE.

42:02.688 --> 42:03.889
BE A GOOD BOY.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.829
BEHAVE YOURSELF.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.864
