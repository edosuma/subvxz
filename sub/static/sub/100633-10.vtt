00:01.802 --> 00:05.402
[DC theme music playing]

00:22.155 --> 00:26.359
How can he call himself Batman
if he's not part bat?

00:26.460 --> 00:29.829
He's just a dude who
dresses up like a bat.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.765
That's animal appropriation.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.603
Hey, everybody!
How was Kite Man's
bachelor party?

00:36.704 --> 00:40.073
I got married and saved
the Oceanic Trade Federation.

00:40.173 --> 00:41.475
Other than that,
pretty chill.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.844
How was Ivy's
bachelorette bash?

00:43.944 --> 00:47.179
It was great. It was so great.
Emotionally low stakes,
you know.

00:47.179 --> 00:50.450
I had a great time.
Ivy had a great time.
We slept in separate beds...

00:50.551 --> 00:53.453
Normal bachelorette stuff.
So, yeah...

00:53.554 --> 00:56.289
Well, hey! I'm just,
I'm ready to
keep the party going!

00:56.390 --> 00:57.918
[blows air horn]

00:57.918 --> 01:01.728
Who wants to get a drink
with me? One or two? Or a few
drinks? Or a lot of drinks?

01:01.829 --> 01:05.231
Drink so much we forget
the last 48 hours
or maybe more?

01:05.331 --> 01:08.802
Oh. I'd love to but
I gotta be with my wife,
Tabitha.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.837
Sunday's are big at her family.

01:10.837 --> 01:14.474
They are very religious,
seeing as how Jesus
was really a shark.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.000
What about you, Clayface?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.477
I, too, am spending
this evening with a paramour.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.879
His name is Tony.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.516
And he's the only award show
that matters.

01:22.615 --> 01:26.016
Okay, have fun, guys...

01:29.388 --> 01:31.358
[Harley sighs]

01:31.457 --> 01:33.793
A landlord always knows
two things:

01:33.894 --> 01:37.798
when an oven's busted, 'cause
ya can't charge rent without
a working oven...

01:37.798 --> 01:38.865
[chuckles]

01:38.965 --> 01:40.634
and when a tenant's blue.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.135
So, spill it, hon,

01:42.234 --> 01:43.870
or I could get my torture kit?

01:43.971 --> 01:47.307
It's just, everybody's got
somebody special
in their lives,

01:47.406 --> 01:48.909
-except me...
-So what?

01:49.009 --> 01:50.911
You don't need a lover
to be happy.

01:51.010 --> 01:53.447
Do the thing
that makes you happy.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.316
Life is about feeding
your soul!

01:56.415 --> 01:58.685
Yeah, no. I'm just gonna
go out and boink the fuck
out of somebody.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.454
Let's get this
party started, bitches!

02:01.555 --> 02:04.625
Harley Quinn's here
and she's down to clown!

02:04.724 --> 02:07.661
[clears throat]
Do you have a reservation?

02:07.760 --> 02:10.830
-Um, no.
-You'll have to clown
at the bar, then.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.598
[sigh]

02:12.699 --> 02:14.634
[theme music playing]

02:16.804 --> 02:19.506
<i>Room for Squares</i> is,
of course, a classic,

02:19.605 --> 02:24.510
but it's really John Mayer's
third album when he solidified
the John Mayer sound.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.513
-[yawns]
-So, my place or yours?

02:26.612 --> 02:29.582
Actually, I'm just gonna
stop talking to you right now.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.186
God. The guys
in this place suck.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.754
Yeah, well, they beat the food.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.657
But what do you expect
from a Wayne?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.000
[both laugh]

02:38.000 --> 02:39.893
That's the first funny thing
a guy's said to me all night.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.695
If you like that,
I got plenty more jokes.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.498
[Joker laughing]

02:48.502 --> 02:50.670
You gotta be fuckin'
kiddin' me.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.875
[Gordon] I want a squad of men
and a single woman

02:54.974 --> 02:57.644
over to the oil refinery
district, ASAP.

02:57.743 --> 03:01.615
Those Parademon bastards
are chugging down oil like
a desperate teen to Benadryl.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.852
Then send another unit,
same gender ratio, to Gotham Park.

03:04.951 --> 03:06.954
And a third crew to... Jesus!

03:07.054 --> 03:10.623
Those hell-rats are
spreading faster than
chlamyd' on my knob!

03:10.723 --> 03:13.393
-Where, sir?
-My privates! Where else
would an STD spread?

03:13.492 --> 03:15.562
I meant where do you want
the third squad, sir?

03:15.662 --> 03:16.689
Oh. The harbor.

03:16.689 --> 03:18.664
-Commissioner, sir!
This came for you.
-Oh!

03:18.764 --> 03:20.768
Gotta be the new
Dave Barry book I ordered.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.736
Every time I read
this guy's stuff I'm like...
"That's pretty funny."

03:24.872 --> 03:26.372
The Dark Knight needs me.

03:28.307 --> 03:31.243
Oh! He remembered.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.882
[Batman] <i>Jim, get in.</i>

03:36.415 --> 03:39.519
[Snoring] No, don't go
in, Magnum.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.389
[loud bang]

03:42.489 --> 03:44.657
Oh. It's you.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.245
I thought ya left the crew.

03:46.245 --> 03:49.429
I'm so sorry, I would've called
but I never got
your phone number.

03:49.528 --> 03:51.764
-Oh, well, mine's 203--
-Don't care.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.332
I'm gonna get my stuff
and head out.

03:53.332 --> 03:55.902
So you're really gonna
just leave Harley

03:55.902 --> 03:57.646
after everything
she did for you?

03:57.646 --> 04:01.040
Okay look, I'm in
a very zen place, and we
have very different goals.

04:01.042 --> 04:03.543
I wanna trounce the skulls
of my fallen foes, and

04:03.644 --> 04:06.646
she wants to... I don't know,
do whatever someone with
a moral compass does.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.514
You ungrateful little shit!

04:08.514 --> 04:11.651
You leave the dance
with the one you brought!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.987
-Riddle me this--
-Oh, shut the fuck up!

04:14.087 --> 04:17.524
Can't you see I'm trying to
elegantly end this conversation

04:17.524 --> 04:19.526
with this mechanical fossil?

04:19.625 --> 04:21.694
Good luck getting out again,
fuck head!

04:21.795 --> 04:24.064
Alright, so I fortified
the shackles on
that hamster wheel.

04:24.165 --> 04:26.500
It's basically impenetrable.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.968
Feed him at 5:00, shock him
at 7:00. Maybe a snack at 9:00
if he's good.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.939
Have fun dying alone,
you fuckin' freak!

04:32.038 --> 04:33.607
Smell ya later, old man.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.346
[screaming]

04:40.747 --> 04:43.350
Jiminy, you look familiar.
Do I know you?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.651
No! No, no, I have
a very common look.

04:45.752 --> 04:48.088
Oh, I remember you
from Noonan's!

04:48.189 --> 04:50.824
You probably don't remember me
because I was
a low-rent barback,

04:50.923 --> 04:53.593
and now I'm an upscale
bartender.

04:53.694 --> 04:57.596
It's a meteoric rise virtually
unheard of in this industry.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.567
Hey! Wait, hold on.
Can I offer you
a Wayne fashioned?

05:01.668 --> 05:04.038
It's like an old fashioned,
but more expensive.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.439
Ya think all ya gotta do
is buy me one
spirit-forward drink

05:07.540 --> 05:08.742
and I'll go gushy for ya?

05:08.841 --> 05:10.377
Uh, not gonna happen.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.079
Whoa, to be clear,
I'm not trying to hit on you.

05:13.079 --> 05:16.449
I'm unbelievably happy
with my wonderful girlfriend.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.350
Mmm, sweet as pie.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.086
Why couldn't you
have just died?

05:20.187 --> 05:22.588
Gosh, I love her.
And our kids.

05:22.588 --> 05:27.459
Well, you know, her kids,
but gosh darn it if they don't
feel like mine, y'know?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.562
I don't know,
and I don't need to know.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.598
All I know is, right now,
you're the last person
I wanna be around!

05:32.699 --> 05:34.867
-I'm hittin' a different bar.
-Hoo, boy. Good luck.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.571
Every watering hole around here
has been infested
with Parademons,

05:37.670 --> 05:39.439
except this one
on account of the...

05:39.538 --> 05:41.875
-[thuds]
-...bulletproof glass.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.644
Yep, the top of Wayne tower
is the safest bar in town.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.713
-[door slams open]
-Hey, everybody!

05:47.814 --> 05:52.485
Sorry to alarm you,
but you're in a hostile
hostage situation.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.553
-Hi, how are you doing?
-[machine gun firing]

05:54.653 --> 05:57.389
Geez, Nicholas.
Not that hostile.

05:57.389 --> 05:59.026
I'm sorry, everyone,
it's his first day.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.026
[all gasping]

06:00.127 --> 06:01.961
Hey, where are you going?

06:02.062 --> 06:05.732
I've read your best chance
of survival is
giving up easily.

06:05.831 --> 06:08.101
Yeah, normally, I'd go
beat the shit out of 'em,

06:08.201 --> 06:10.069
but I'm havin' a night
and wanna be able
to return this dress.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.004
So, you're just gonna escape?

06:12.060 --> 06:14.473
Uh, yeah. I'm not spending
my big night out here,

06:14.473 --> 06:16.910
-and certainly not with
the likes of you.
-[thief] Oh, sugar.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.845
-We got a wild one.
-[thud]

06:21.148 --> 06:22.682
[groans]

06:24.684 --> 06:27.120
You gotta be kidding me.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.189
[man on radio] <i>Look, bud, all</i>
<i>we're asking is that you</i>
<i>release the swanky hostages.</i>

06:29.290 --> 06:34.261
Not gonna happen until I get
$50 million!

06:34.261 --> 06:36.797
I'll wire it to you right now!
Please!

06:36.896 --> 06:38.932
Hold your horses,
I wasn't done.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.035
But let's defiantly
sidebar after.

06:41.134 --> 06:44.704
Also, gonna need a
W76-2 nuclear warhead

06:44.704 --> 06:46.639
on a Trident II D5 missile...

06:46.740 --> 06:50.776
I'm a military contractor.
You can have it.
Just don't shoot!

06:50.877 --> 06:54.048
Wow. Okay.
Well, you know,
while we're here...

06:54.148 --> 06:59.148
I'm also gonna need a pair of
game-worn Air Jordan 2 OG's.

07:00.519 --> 07:02.055
Would ya stop starin' at me?

07:02.156 --> 07:03.857
Sorry, it's just...

07:03.956 --> 07:06.093
this is gonna sound crazy,
but...

07:06.192 --> 07:08.495
since we're not going anywhere
anytime soon...

07:08.595 --> 07:12.531
after the first time we met,
I had a dream about you!

07:12.632 --> 07:15.101
-Boy was it wacky.
-Wacky how?

07:15.201 --> 07:17.838
We were on a yacht
with these bankers.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.007
And get this:
we were a couple! Right?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.177
Us? No way!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.545
That bleached skin gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

07:25.644 --> 07:27.947
It's gross. I mean, no offense!

07:28.048 --> 07:31.584
But in the dream,
I was so filled with rage,

07:31.584 --> 07:34.120
I robbed the bankers.

07:34.221 --> 07:38.091
-You didn't set them on fire,
did you?
-Wait. You had the same dream?

07:38.192 --> 07:39.959
-Freaaaky.
-Yes!

07:40.060 --> 07:42.595
A dream. Never happened.
Pure fiction. Not canon.
Ignore it.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.266
It's like meeting you
triggered some...

07:45.365 --> 07:47.800
Well, darn it,
it felt like a past life!

07:47.901 --> 07:50.137
Funny, huh? [yells]

07:50.237 --> 07:52.172
-What are you doing?
-Jesus Christ, I'm getting us
the fuck out of here.

07:52.273 --> 07:54.208
Please don't use
the Lord's name in vain.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.456
How much do you weigh?

07:55.456 --> 07:59.079
I did a Paleo November,
and now I'm fitting into
my skinny cords.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.283
-So, I'm guessing around 170--
-Uh! Never mind.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.884
-[yells]
-[grunting]

08:04.985 --> 08:07.288
This! Night! Sucks!

08:09.723 --> 08:12.692
[grunts]

08:12.793 --> 08:16.163
Um, I think you just
straight up killed that guy
back there.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.831
-Do you wanna
talk about it, or--
-No.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.767
Are you sure? My girlfriend
says I'm a good listener.
Sometimes too good.

08:21.867 --> 08:25.704
On what occasion would that be?
Because you have not
shut the fuck up all night!

08:25.805 --> 08:27.940
It just seems to me
like you have
something going on.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.110
Trust me, you're not
someone I can
talk to about this.

08:30.209 --> 08:33.647
Why not? A bartender
is basically like a therapist.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.881
-So, come on!
-[gasps]

08:35.982 --> 08:38.585
-I told my best friend
I love her!
-There it is.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.586
But she doesn't trust me enough
to love me back.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.822
You can't love
without trust.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.092
[exhale] I thought I was fine
bein' alone after
my relationship with Jok...

08:46.192 --> 08:48.894
esph... fina... stein.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.831
Joksephfinastein?
Sounds Flemish.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.269
No one knew his backstory.
Anyway, he was a total
abusive dick,

08:55.369 --> 08:58.238
hell-bent on utter destruction
and the world's better off
without him!

08:58.339 --> 09:01.640
You go, girl!
Having a good vent
in a literal vent. Come on!

09:01.740 --> 09:03.015
Keep on going!

09:11.684 --> 09:12.785
[yawns]

09:13.653 --> 09:14.955
[loud thud]

09:15.054 --> 09:16.956
This sucks.
I'm not even doing anything.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.293
That's not true.
You get to hit the button.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.760
But I wanna fly the plane.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.964
<i>Be a part of the action!</i>
<i>At least let me shoot</i>
<i>a sweet missile.</i>

09:24.063 --> 09:27.801
Okay. It takes years
of training to expertly control
the Batplane.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.971
<i>-But, Batman, I wanna!</i>
-Alfred, this is ridiculous.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.806
Why don't you let me
go out there already?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.975
Your city needs you healed,
Master Bruce.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.312
I won't allow you to
return to action prematurely,
again.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.679
Besides, it's only Parademons.

09:40.779 --> 09:42.149
[spits] It's too hot.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.985
-You could wait, Master Wayne.
-Yes, Alfred...

09:45.085 --> 09:46.086
I could.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.105
[blows]

09:57.364 --> 09:59.299
Huh?

09:59.399 --> 10:02.034
Batman! Are you seeing this?
Gunfire at Wayne Tower.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.104
Come on, big guy!
Give papa some action.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.974
[Exhale] <i>Fine.</i>
<i>Don't scratch the paint.</i>

10:07.073 --> 10:08.375
Booya!

10:11.378 --> 10:13.846
I just feel so alone
without Ivy!

10:13.947 --> 10:16.182
I mean, sure, there are
some things I could've
done differently. Okay!

10:16.283 --> 10:18.251
At the end of the day,
she broke up with me
'cause I'm too impulsive

10:18.251 --> 10:20.320
and I go around
'causing messes and
never clean 'em up.

10:20.321 --> 10:23.722
-Aw! Doesn't it feel good
just to say it out loud?
-No!

10:23.823 --> 10:25.859
-Harley? Well, well, well...
-Riddler?

10:25.958 --> 10:28.328
...if it isn't
the simple clown herself.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.197
-How did you--
-Get here?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.432
[chuckles]
Well, I escaped the mall.

10:32.533 --> 10:36.669
Then, I orchestrated
a hostage situation upstairs
as a distraction,

10:36.769 --> 10:40.441
so I could sneak in here
to grab this baby.

10:40.541 --> 10:43.143
-Classic misdirect.
-Yeah, yeah, great.
But, I was gonna say,

10:43.243 --> 10:45.379
-how did ya get so buff?
-Hmm?

10:45.479 --> 10:48.381
Oh. Spending every waking
moment running on that hamster
wheel gets you shredded.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.217
I mean,
check out these quads...
wait, wait, wait.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.719
Is that Joker?

10:52.818 --> 10:55.288
Oh, my, you think
I look like the Joker?

10:55.389 --> 10:58.958
[Joker laugh]

10:59.058 --> 11:02.328
Nope, no! He's just a bartender
who gives great,
non-judgmental advice.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.466
Well, either way,
you're both gonna die.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.802
Sure, I moved back
to Gotham to see 'em,

11:09.903 --> 11:12.806
-but what if my kids
don't want to see me?
-Don't say that, Carl.

11:12.905 --> 11:16.210
Yeah, but it's been seven
long years. I left 'em when
they needed me most.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.412
You can't keep
blaming yourself
for the past.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.946
You need to forget.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.780
Maybe they're better off
without me.

11:21.881 --> 11:22.881
[Harley gasps]

11:25.018 --> 11:26.785
[gunshots]

11:26.886 --> 11:28.687
[exclaiming]

11:36.196 --> 11:38.499
[gasps]

11:38.599 --> 11:40.767
Tuck in any fingers
you wanna keep!

11:44.104 --> 11:46.940
-Oh. What'd that do?
-I don't know.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.909
Oh, no. Carl, I'm so sorry...

11:50.009 --> 11:51.912
It's a cancer ray.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.081
Harley Quinn,
you gave me cancer?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.182
Why would they even make this?

11:56.283 --> 11:59.119
Well, that's it, Kev.
I'm gonna go spend the holidays
with my kids.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.520
I'm so sorry!

12:02.423 --> 12:03.956
-[zapping]
-[shouts]

12:05.491 --> 12:07.494
No, no, please.
Please, please... Ow!

12:08.861 --> 12:10.062
[struggles]

12:11.097 --> 12:12.198
[yells]

12:13.600 --> 12:15.168
-[Joker laughter]
-No.

12:15.269 --> 12:17.303
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

12:17.403 --> 12:20.039
Ow! [zaps out]

12:20.139 --> 12:21.774
My blood sugar
must be crashing.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.410
Is there a vending machine
around here? [gasps]

12:24.510 --> 12:26.245
Did you kill another person?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.148
Let's just chopper out of here.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.417
All that gratuitous violence.
Yuck.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.385
This is why
I don't like TV today.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.354
Violence ups
the dramatic effect.

12:34.455 --> 12:36.523
I got enough drama in my life.

12:36.624 --> 12:39.393
Just once, I'd like to watch
something where two people
fall in love,

12:39.493 --> 12:41.827
and experience
no complications whatsoever.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.827
Oh, and they don't have sex
till they're married.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.102
Oh, my gosh, Batman?

12:51.304 --> 12:53.240
Harley Quinn! And...

12:54.307 --> 12:55.576
It's the Joker.

12:55.676 --> 12:58.979
-[impact and struggling sounds]
-I did it!

12:59.078 --> 13:01.947
I took down Batman's archenemy!
On my own.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.551
Papa for the win! [laughs]

13:04.652 --> 13:07.153
Gordo? [manic laughter]

13:07.254 --> 13:08.989
[in low voice]
Good to see ya, buddy!

13:11.991 --> 13:13.960
What's happening?
Don't leave me in here!

13:14.059 --> 13:16.462
-Please, I don't like
small spaces!
-[Batplane locks]

13:16.562 --> 13:19.399
I knew it was only a matter
of time until you two psychos
started knocking boots again.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.902
What? No. Uh! See, he's...

13:22.001 --> 13:23.336
Never mind, I'll explain later.

13:23.437 --> 13:26.038
Harley! We came as soon as
we got your text.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.942
Indeed! I paused the Tonys
and I'm DVRing it,

13:29.042 --> 13:31.412
so no one tell me who won
Best Lighting in a Musical.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.846
It was Howell Binkley,
wasn't it?

13:33.947 --> 13:38.150
When's Japhy Weideman
going to get his day in
the fucking sun!

13:38.251 --> 13:40.620
-I didn't text anyone.
-Then who did?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.457
-Swole!
-[all exclaiming]

13:44.557 --> 13:46.259
Did ya just run up
18 flights?

13:46.360 --> 13:48.995
Uh, try 19 and a half.
[chuckles]

13:49.096 --> 13:51.498
How did you escape
Psycho's fortified jail?

13:51.599 --> 13:53.500
And get so hot
without us knowing?

13:57.336 --> 13:59.172
Here ya go, pal.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.542
You know what, I lied.
I did have your phone number.

14:01.642 --> 14:04.244
I actually had
everyone's phone number!

14:04.344 --> 14:07.013
And I was the one
who texted you all!

14:07.114 --> 14:08.548
-[all gasp]
-How dare you?

14:08.649 --> 14:10.517
Yep! And get this...

14:10.618 --> 14:13.019
we actually like each other.
A lot.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.955
You were working for Riddler
all along.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.457
-Um, actually...
-He's with me.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.493
You're dating Riddler?

14:19.592 --> 14:22.395
<i>Quel scandale!</i>

14:22.495 --> 14:24.965
-[in shock]
-Okay, we're not fucking!

14:25.065 --> 14:26.332
-We're together!
-I see.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.168
Not using labels yet, are we?

14:28.268 --> 14:31.071
Too new, is it?
Lot of changes, Psycho.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.340
Dating, hooking up,
"baring ass."

14:33.440 --> 14:38.177
Call it what you will,
I'm proud of you for
finally being who you are.

14:38.278 --> 14:43.149
We're in a business partnership
based on mutual respect, idiot.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.519
And you know what,
he doesn't belittle me
like you did, Quinn.

14:45.619 --> 14:46.986
How did I belittle you?

14:47.086 --> 14:48.989
You never recognized my talent!

14:49.089 --> 14:51.091
You never let me shine!

14:51.191 --> 14:53.058
And also,
you hated working for a woman.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.495
Okay, also I hated
working for a woman!
But who cares?

14:55.596 --> 14:58.264
So, you and Ninja Turtle Calves
are gonna fight us? Oh, please.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.134
You're a tiny man
in a silly tinfoil hat.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.235
All right, here we go!

15:04.370 --> 15:07.006
[Psycho screaming]

15:07.774 --> 15:09.375
[Parademons screech]

15:09.475 --> 15:12.044
Maybe your gal-pal Ivy
can help!

15:12.144 --> 15:14.715
You wanna call her, maybe?

15:14.815 --> 15:17.984
No, I don't wanna get her
wrapped up in this
'cause this...

15:18.083 --> 15:20.486
This is a very strong example

15:20.586 --> 15:23.089
of one of those messes I make
I was tellin' you about.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.027
This "tinfoil hat"

15:27.126 --> 15:28.995
amplifies brainwaves,

15:29.095 --> 15:31.597
supercharging my mind powers.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.601
And with this bad boy,
plus my new hobby of
guided meditation,

15:35.702 --> 15:39.373
I can control every
Parademon in the city.

15:39.373 --> 15:43.176
Oh, I see. He's doin'
my old plan of
takin' over Gotham

15:43.176 --> 15:44.543
to team up with Darkseid
and rule the Earth.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.246
Then I'm gonna
take over Gotham

15:47.246 --> 15:49.482
-and team up with Dark--
-[Gordon] She just said that.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.183
Shit! Fuck.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.519
The point is, I'm gonna do
what you never could,

15:53.519 --> 15:55.322
because you are a pussy.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.158
Pussies are powerful.
They birthed all of humanity!

15:58.158 --> 15:59.259
I was a C-Section.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.364
Bring it on!
I'm hungry for Parademons!

16:04.464 --> 16:06.166
Stage combat!

16:07.634 --> 16:09.669
Get me outta here! Not...

16:09.769 --> 16:11.538
-[beeping]
-This one! This one...

16:11.638 --> 16:16.437
-[electrical buzzing]
-[screams]

16:23.316 --> 16:24.518
Wow. It's like straight steel.

16:24.618 --> 16:27.153
What's black, blue,
and red all over?

16:27.254 --> 16:29.054
Your ass when I beat it!

16:29.154 --> 16:31.424
I guess
when the abs get harder,
the riddles get dumber.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.875
Bring it, bitch.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.370
-[Parademon screeches]
-I've got this, boys.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.239
[gunshots fired]

16:46.340 --> 16:48.375
-[screeches]
-And it's all you.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.147
Give up, Psycho,
and maybe I'll let you live

16:54.246 --> 16:57.149
as one of those orphans
that builds Wayneboxes.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.219
Uh... I'm gonna pass!

17:00.419 --> 17:03.269
[maniacal laughter]

17:10.196 --> 17:12.499
You thought this would be
a fair fight?

17:12.598 --> 17:15.298
You're going down!

17:19.506 --> 17:21.208
Why didn't it work
on the old timer?

17:21.307 --> 17:23.410
Same reason I can't go
to the airport:

17:23.509 --> 17:25.178
metal plates, baby!

17:25.278 --> 17:27.847
God, you're old. Whatever.
I'll kill you too.

17:27.948 --> 17:30.217
[both growl]

17:33.519 --> 17:35.855
Why don't you just brainwash me
and end this?

17:35.955 --> 17:39.192
Oh, but where's the pizazz
in that?

17:39.291 --> 17:43.430
It's way more fun
to torture you with
everything you love.

17:43.529 --> 17:47.267
This right here is exactly why
you're a terrible supervillain.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.737
-[growls]
-[Harley grunts]

17:51.238 --> 17:52.271
[gunshots]

17:53.740 --> 17:57.344
[growling]

17:57.376 --> 18:00.913
You know what,
for too long I've been
looked at as a joke,

18:00.914 --> 18:06.015
but when I'm through,
people are gonna respect
the name Dr. Psycho!

18:06.353 --> 18:09.423
With Batman and
the Justice League gone,

18:09.522 --> 18:12.491
Gotham was yours
for the taking, Harley.

18:12.593 --> 18:14.595
But you couldn't do it.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.132
[growling]

18:22.501 --> 18:24.637
You know,
I should thank you, Harley.

18:24.637 --> 18:29.308
If you never made me feel
so small, I never would've
known how big I could be.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.593
[both growling]

18:37.851 --> 18:39.152
[yells]

18:39.853 --> 18:42.521
Quinn, God I hate you,

18:42.623 --> 18:44.590
but I need your help.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.727
If we can break through
the dome we can escape
in the Batplane.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.761
Can't you just use
a bat-missile?

18:48.862 --> 18:51.865
Yeah. We could,
but sometimes I just don't
feel like it.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.500
Or I don't wanna.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.469
All right, I'm not allowed
to use them.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.671
-I'll do it.
I'll break through the dome.
-What?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.439
Sy, that's suicide!

18:59.538 --> 19:00.539
[gasps]

19:00.641 --> 19:03.410
Harley, dear, I'll admit,

19:03.509 --> 19:07.748
when you left the mall
earlier tonight, I did not
expect to be in this position.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.182
-But it's a gift!
-Sy, you're...

19:10.817 --> 19:12.419
You're standing.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.755
This is me
feeding my soul, baby.

19:14.855 --> 19:17.758
Nothing would make me fuller
than saving your <i>tuchis</i>

19:17.857 --> 19:21.961
and helping you take down
that angry little <i>shvants</i>
in a tux.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.230
I never liked that one.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.865
[on PA system]
He's gonna kill all of us
if you don't stop talking.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.701
[crying] Oh.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.236
You were the best landlord
I've ever had.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.471
You always fixed our oven
so fast,

19:32.571 --> 19:34.574
and you never judged me
no matter how many times

19:34.674 --> 19:36.777
I flushed my tampons
down the toilet.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.846
[grunts]

19:39.946 --> 19:43.683
As long as you've got this,
you've always got a friend.

19:46.886 --> 19:47.936
[gasps]

19:51.959 --> 19:53.660
Hey, Psycho!

19:53.759 --> 19:57.730
Thousands of years ago,
my people, the Maccabees,

19:57.830 --> 20:01.233
prayed for oil to last
when they needed it most.

20:01.334 --> 20:06.440
Unlucky for you,
that very same oil
runs through my veins

20:06.440 --> 20:08.375
today!

20:08.474 --> 20:10.911
[loud grunt]

20:11.845 --> 20:14.247
Yes! I mean darn.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.983
Ah, those Parademons took out
the communications system.

20:17.084 --> 20:19.318
No more autopilot!
Buckle up, Quinn.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.738
Papa's about to earn himself
some wings.

20:29.695 --> 20:33.901
I regret lots of things!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.701
[explodes]

20:38.438 --> 20:41.438
[shield powers down]

20:43.911 --> 20:45.278
Fuck!

20:47.713 --> 20:50.717
[Gordon] Okay, that was
the plane's fault.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.819
We need to take
Psycho down, now.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.000
Who knows how much damage
he can do with that helmet?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.857
Yeah, but how? It'd take, like,
the entire Justice League
to stop him.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.859
I had a dream about them, too.

20:59.859 --> 21:03.430
This is gonna sound crazy
but they were stuck in a book.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.732
-What did ya just say?
-Yeah. It was
this Book of Fables?

21:06.732 --> 21:08.669
Yeah! Queen of Fables.
How did you know that?

21:08.669 --> 21:11.371
Was in one of my dreams.
I held a book

21:11.471 --> 21:13.840
with the entire
Justice League in it.

21:13.941 --> 21:16.809
But, you know,
then I woke up and
I don't remember the rest.

21:16.910 --> 21:18.545
[chuckles] Weird!

21:18.644 --> 21:20.579
Gordon, I need you
to drop us off somewhere.

21:22.950 --> 21:25.085
There's a lot of
powerful memories here.

21:25.185 --> 21:26.953
Is this your hideout?

21:27.054 --> 21:29.690
It's not very cozy.
Let me call Beth.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.592
She has family in Central City.
We could stay there

21:32.692 --> 21:34.560
till this whole mess
blows over.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.763
Just me, Beth, the kids,
and my new pal Harley Quinn.

21:37.865 --> 21:40.567
Nah, no, no, Ivy was right.
I keep makin' messes.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.070
I brought in the Parademons.
I took in Psycho.
I caused all of this.

21:44.171 --> 21:46.373
I can't keep runnin'
from my messes.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.107
And the way I see it,
cleanup starts with

21:48.107 --> 21:50.509
gettin' the Justice League
out of that storybook.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.444
The storybook is real?
Where is it?

21:52.546 --> 21:54.413
I don't know,
but I think you do.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.516
Are you sure
you can't just remember?

21:56.615 --> 21:59.451
It's like I see the book,
but... [grunts]

21:59.553 --> 22:01.788
everything else is cloudy.

22:01.888 --> 22:06.625
That's disappointing because
I really, really, really,
don't wanna have to do this.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.694
-Do what?
-[sighs]

22:08.795 --> 22:11.832
I'll be seein' ya soon,
Mistah J.

22:11.932 --> 22:15.981
-[shoving grunt]
-[screams]

22:23.643 --> 22:25.144
[closing theme music playing]
