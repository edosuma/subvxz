to strive towards,

to raise them in their wretched lives.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.333

they're priests, not kings.

his own family destroyed,

-Well...

His Majesty was, like his father before him,
a stickler for convention and tradition,

And then she switched her tack
without so much as a flicker. Clever.

55:19.233 --> 55:21.519
-No, no, not clever. Ingenious.
-Why?

55:21.611 --> 55:25.729
Because it disarmed me
and made me switch tack, too.

55:26.407 --> 55:27.487
What about?

55:27.575 --> 55:29.657
About allowing Philip to learn to fly.

55:30.536 --> 55:31.651
He can now.

55:32.163 --> 55:33.243
Good.

55:34.957 --> 55:38.415
But he still has to ask Cabinet
permission to do rolls and spins.

55:42.340 --> 55:43.420
(SETS DOWN GLASS)

55:49.055 --> 55:50.636
What, dear girl?

55:53.893 --> 55:55.758
But what if the fog hadn't lifted?

55:58.231 --> 56:00.438
And the government
had continued to flounder?

56:01.442 --> 56:03.774
And people had continued to die?

56:05.029 --> 56:07.145
And Churchill
had continued to cling to power

56:07.240 --> 56:09.572
and the country had continued to suffer?

56:11.160 --> 56:15.369
It doesn't feel right, as Head of State,
to do nothing.

56:15.998 --> 56:19.411
-It is exactly right.
-ls it?

56:23.130 --> 56:26.042
To do nothing is the hardestjob of all.

56:26.133 --> 56:29.000
And it will take every ounce of energy
that you have.

56:30.304 --> 56:33.262
To be impartial is not natural, not human.

56:33.975 --> 56:37.888
People will always want you to smile
or agree or frown.

56:37.979 --> 56:42.268
And the minute you do, you will have
declared a position, a point of view.

56:42.358 --> 56:47.148
And that is the one thing as Sovereign
that you are not entitled to do.

56:48.489 --> 56:53.279
The less you do,
the less you say or agree or smile...

56:53.369 --> 56:56.736
Or think? Or feel? Or breathe? Or exist?

56:56.831 --> 56:58.321
...the better.

57:01.877 --> 57:04.004
Well, that's fine for the Sovereign.

57:06.299 --> 57:08.005
But where does that leave me?

57:22.315 --> 57:23.304
PHILIP: So, go on.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.639
How long would it take me to get my wings?

57:25.735 --> 57:29.193
Well, normally, a trainee would spend
anything between 100 and 120 hours

57:29.280 --> 57:30.770
in one of these things.

57:30.865 --> 57:32.480
Do you think I could do it in three months?

57:32.992 --> 57:34.528
That would be unusual, sir.

57:35.453 --> 57:37.444
I'm a fast learner,

57:37.538 --> 57:40.200
and believe me when I say
I've got nothing else to do.

57:55.890 --> 57:57.801
I couldn't help notice you filled her right up.

57:57.892 --> 58:01.134
-Starboard and port. Eighteen gallons?
-PETER: Yes.

58:01.228 --> 58:03.605
PHILIP: Fancy lunch in Edinburgh?
PETER: Edinburgh?

58:03.731 --> 58:07.440
PHILIP: They made me Duke there, so
I should probably show up from time to time.

58:07.526 --> 58:09.482
Unless you have
more pressing engagements?

58:09.570 --> 58:11.401
-PETER: No, sir.
-All right.

58:11.906 --> 58:15.319
PHILIP: All right, I'll adjust RPMs
and cruising speed for range flying.

58:15.409 --> 58:18.776
PETER: We'll have to land to refuel, sir.
RAF Finningley.

58:18.871 --> 58:21.237
PHILIP: Oh, really? Where's that?
PETER: Doncaster.

58:21.332 --> 58:24.415
PHILIP: Doncaster? Right.

58:48.317 --> 58:50.353
