01:07.900 --> 01:12.092
<i>-Seven billion people were killed
in the last Great War.</i>

01:13.447 --> 01:15.036
<i>Not all at once, though.</i>

01:15.197 --> 01:18.597
<i>It takes time to wipe
out an entire species .</i>

01:19.915 --> 01:22.792
<i>We are the survivors.</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:26.781
<i>Some say we were the lucky ones.</i>

01:27.286 --> 01:29.506
<i>But when I was a kid,</i>

01:29.531 --> 01:31.604
<i>My mother used to
tell me stories about</i>

01:31.629 --> 01:33.287
<i>what life was like back then,</i>

01:34.208 --> 01:35.782
<i>before the radiation,</i>

01:36.951 --> 01:38.731
<i>before the plague,</i>

01:39.398 --> 01:40.620
<i>before the drought.</i>

01:43.479 --> 01:47.603
<i>At first, I didn't  believe her.
It all sounded too good to be true,</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:51.507
<i>like some sort of crazy fairy tale that
spun horribly out of control.</i>

01:52.903 --> 01:57.165
<i>Now that there only are few of us
left, something has become clear to me..</i>

01:59.250 --> 02:01.431
<i>We have a choice.</i>

02:06.877 --> 02:08.966
<i>We can either carve
out a new future</i>

02:08.991 --> 02:12.329
<i>for ourselves on the tombstone
of this dying planet,</i>

02:15.655 --> 02:19.196
<i>or go back to that fairy tale.</i>

02:22.264 --> 02:24.743
<i>And try again.</i>

02:58.773 --> 03:00.152
-Are you folks lost?

03:07.163 --> 03:09.301
-Is this the way to get
to Piccadilly Circus ?

03:11.034 --> 03:13.790
-You're too late. They've run
out of Blackbird pie.

03:14.095 --> 03:15.441
-Well, I guess we'll have to
come back yesterday,

03:15.466 --> 03:16.732
before they're all gone.

03:18.612 --> 03:19.697
-Welcome to The Domes.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.515
-Thank you.
Agent Higgs is expecting us.

03:23.967 --> 03:25.426
-Higgs, you got some visitors.

03:30.532 --> 03:32.453
-Where have you been?
 You're late.

03:32.478 --> 03:33.890
-They've all set up road blocks.

03:33.915 --> 03:35.276
We had to take the
not so scenic route.

03:35.301 --> 03:37.158
If we hurry we can still make it
 into the jump window.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.329
-Let me get your identification, OK?

03:40.446 --> 03:43.942
Stand still. 
<i>-Agent Lancer. Identity confirmed.</i>

03:45.216 --> 03:48.141
<i>Agent Seattle.
Identity confirmed.</i>

03:48.166 --> 03:49.573
-OK, follow me.

03:51.229 --> 03:53.004
Now, this is your first jump, right?

03:53.029 --> 03:54.486
Yes.
-OK.

03:54.706 --> 03:57.251
We don't have time
 for a complete debriefing,

03:57.601 --> 04:01.728
Now, you're familiar with the
 NCNG protocol, I hope?

04:01.873 --> 04:04.337
- "Nothing comes  nothing goes."
-That's good, that's good.

04:04.789 --> 04:07.116
Now, a few pointers.

04:09.268 --> 04:12.978
Keep your interactions
with the locals to a minimum.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.307
That will help maintain your cover.

04:16.233 --> 04:17.399
-Got it.

04:18.534 --> 04:21.946
-Some changes are to be expected.
It's part of the territory.

04:22.169 --> 04:24.298
As long your results
are net positive,

04:24.323 --> 04:26.573
you can consider your
mission to be a success.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.903
-Have others failed?

04:32.274 --> 04:33.993
-We're all still here, aren't we?

04:38.681 --> 04:39.937
Watch your step.

04:44.038 --> 04:46.142
The first jump can be 
a little  disorienting.

04:46.486 --> 04:50.103
It might take a while for you  to get
acclimated to your new skin.

04:50.982 --> 04:55.214
Some agents experience paranoia,
delusions, psychosis.

04:55.239 --> 04:59.319
Others, once they go into stasis
they never wake up.

05:00.035 --> 05:02.407
Lucky for you, we've worked out those bugs.

05:02.487 --> 05:04.301
Well, most of them.

05:05.779 --> 05:07.509
Secure your weapons up here.

05:09.303 --> 05:10.597
Right up here.

05:14.944 --> 05:17.181
Put your personal belongings
in these baskets.

05:18.731 --> 05:20.923
Then put the baskets back in the rack.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.423
You can retrieve them when 
you come out of stasis.

05:23.593 --> 05:24.987
There is a wash bin right here.

05:25.050 --> 05:27.969
Wash up when you're  done.

05:39.171 --> 05:41.703
-Have you ever done this before?
Jump, I mean.

05:41.728 --> 05:46.650
-Well, we're all required to log  500
hours before we're certified, so yes.

05:49.698 --> 05:51.251
-Any advice tor first timers?

05:51.722 --> 05:52.814
Well...

05:53.769 --> 05:56.271
Have you ever had those dreams
where you know you're asleep,

05:56.398 --> 05:58.531
but everyone else around 
you thinks it's real?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.814
Just remember who's awake.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.325
Who's  first?

06:10.222 --> 06:11.220
I'll go.

06:12.124 --> 06:13.124
-OK.

06:30.953 --> 06:32.119
-Don't be a stranger.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.646
-Let's go.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.100
-See you on the other side.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.177
-Right here.

07:42.252 --> 07:43.253
-Are you ready?

07:44.416 --> 07:46.460
-Bring it
-OK.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.626
Seriously, Ava? Again?
It's the third time this year!

10:16.775 --> 10:18.400
-School is overrated.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.126
- We need to talk!
-Why start now?

10:23.263 --> 10:25.125
-Do you think I like living like this?

10:28.521 --> 10:32.191
Can't you see that I'm trying, Ava? 
I'm doing the best that I can.

10:32.224 --> 10:34.222
-It's not my fault you
screwed up your own life

10:34.247 --> 10:36.034
and it doesn't mean you get
to relive it through me.

10:36.059 --> 10:37.803
-It never ends with you, does it?

10:39.722 --> 10:40.848
-I guess not.

10:42.855 --> 10:44.426
-Why are you so angry?

10:44.551 --> 10:47.688
Whatever happened to my little girl?
I miss her.

10:47.963 --> 10:49.220
-You'll get over it.

10:49.245 --> 10:52.120
-You  ungrateful little brat!
-Oh, real nice.

10:52.145 --> 10:54.402
I was going to let you go out and
have fun tonight, but instead

10:54.427 --> 10:56.977
you're gonna stay here and youâ€™re
gonna clean up this pig sty!

11:43.686 --> 11:44.687
-Hey!!

11:45.928 --> 11:48.864
Nice outfit. You look amazing.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.599
Thanks, so do you.
 Do you think Matt will like it?

11:52.624 --> 11:55.185
Uh, he's male and has a pulse.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.779
What do you think?

11:57.053 --> 11:59.968
-OK, good. I think you know, we might...

12:00.966 --> 12:03.043
-No way.
-Yeah.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.825
-You little slut!
-I know.

12:06.981 --> 12:08.327
-Where are you gonna do it?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.896
I don't know. 
I haven't planned the play-by-play.

12:11.311 --> 12:14.231
You know, I just figured 
see how things work out.

12:14.256 --> 12:16.132
-I will drink to that.

12:20.151 --> 12:22.069
I know  what you need.

12:22.670 --> 12:26.231
A little something to take the edge off.

12:35.429 --> 12:36.973
Just a few,

12:38.129 --> 12:39.661
or will not remember a thing,

12:39.939 --> 12:43.610
and I'm gonna want to know all the 
juicy details.

12:45.686 --> 12:50.153
Well, you're not the only one who
wants to have fun today.

12:51.311 --> 12:52.685
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:52.716 --> 12:56.269
-Wow, you're looking hot tonight.
-So are you.

12:57.503 --> 13:00.268
-Come on, I want to show you something.
-What?

13:05.598 --> 13:06.887
I got your beanie!

13:06.912 --> 13:08.603
"You think you're so funny, don't you?"
-I got you.

13:09.441 --> 13:11.151
-Here, give it back.
-No.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.291
Come on.

13:13.813 --> 13:16.148
It's much better this way.

13:23.274 --> 13:24.400
You've had enough.

13:27.514 --> 13:28.515
-This is mine.

13:31.128 --> 13:32.253
Come here.

13:35.867 --> 13:36.868
-I don't feel good.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.325
I seriously don't feel good.

13:40.859 --> 13:42.944
-I've got something that 
will make you feel better.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.243
-Shit. Ava!

13:47.578 --> 13:48.578
Ava!

13:54.042 --> 13:55.085
You've had enough.

13:58.626 --> 14:00.957
-I will drink to that.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.596
You  ungrateful little brat!

14:06.537 --> 14:07.936
-Real nice.

14:10.714 --> 14:13.550
-My god, Ava.
-Ava?"

14:14.687 --> 14:16.457
-Shit! What happened?
-I don't know.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.985
She was fine a few seconds ago.
-My God.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
-Shit.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.051
-My God. Ava.

14:23.076 --> 14:24.012
-My God.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.286
-Somebody call 911!

15:04.195 --> 15:06.059
-Matt? Circe?

15:07.552 --> 15:08.856
Where is everyone?

16:06.636 --> 16:07.636
Ow.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.793
Mom! Let me in.

16:19.856 --> 16:21.020
-What  now?

16:24.581 --> 16:27.138
Look, alright, I don't need a lecture..

16:27.301 --> 16:29.637
You know there is someone
 in the house and...

16:29.662 --> 16:31.290
Just let me in, okay?

16:33.189 --> 16:34.273
-What's the matter?

16:35.688 --> 16:37.160
-She's right there. She's right there.

16:38.544 --> 16:39.962
-I thought I heard something at the door.

16:39.987 --> 16:42.020
-You need to get her out! No, no, no.

16:46.168 --> 16:48.629
-It better not be
not one of your idiot friends.

16:48.654 --> 16:49.905
-Can you not see me?

16:49.998 --> 16:51.642
-Some of us have to work in the morning.

16:58.704 --> 17:00.328
-I don't know who you think you are!

17:01.636 --> 17:02.719
-Hello?

17:04.405 --> 17:05.868
Is anyone there?
-Yeah

17:06.964 --> 17:07.836
-Alright.

17:10.077 --> 17:11.098
-Come on, Lancer.

17:12.201 --> 17:13.180
Where are you?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.648
-Get out of here!

17:17.415 --> 17:18.762
I said get out!

17:20.813 --> 17:21.939
-Lancer?

17:23.800 --> 17:26.137
Is that you? Who did that?

17:27.816 --> 17:29.094
Did you miss your jump?

17:41.853 --> 17:44.641
-Why wasn't I been informed
of this breach sooner?

17:44.666 --> 17:46.285
-It was not necessarily a breach per Se.

17:46.359 --> 17:48.778
They boys in engineering detected a slight 
protuberance on the continuum.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.319
They assured me it was just a glitch.

17:50.444 --> 17:54.112
-Well, tell them not to think too
hard. They might hurt themselves.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.420
Jeez.

18:01.202 --> 18:04.281
Are you a gambling man, Brewer?

18:04.740 --> 18:05.220
No.

18:07.938 --> 18:12.528
-Hmm, "no". 
You clearly lack the intestinal fortitude.

18:14.522 --> 18:17.447
Well, I am.

18:23.101 --> 18:26.159
And I'll bet anything that
the rebels have moved

18:26.184 --> 18:28.402
their stasis
chambers underground

18:28.914 --> 18:31.597
to hide electromagnetic footprint..

18:32.533 --> 18:37.975
So, it's time you stop wasting
time chasing imaginary glitches

18:38.000 --> 18:43.243
and tell your boys in engineering to
track down their point of origin!

18:43.268 --> 18:46.610
-Sir, that signal was very faint.
Barely a blip on our scanners.

18:46.789 --> 18:49.665
Even if there were a time jump, the
rebels couldn't have gone very far.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.879
-I do not care if they went  back
five years or five minutes.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.935
A jump causes ripples.
And ripples have consequences.

19:04.711 --> 19:08.398
Sometimes I wish time travel 
had never been invented.

19:08.861 --> 19:10.578
It's more trouble than it's worth.

19:11.303 --> 19:15.985
We've got rebels popping up 
of every goddamned time stream.

19:16.324 --> 19:17.339
They're like ticks.

19:17.733 --> 19:20.069
And once they're dug into a time zone,

19:21.936 --> 19:23.824
it is impossible to root them out.

19:24.636 --> 19:26.835
-On the plus note, last month alone,

19:26.900 --> 19:30.373
We've cleared out rebel bases both in
97 Hong Kong and pre-9/11 New York.

19:30.623 --> 19:32.974
-Congratulations, that's two.

19:34.017 --> 19:37.818
How many others are out there disturbing
the time stream now?

19:38.725 --> 19:39.868
-We're working on that.

19:39.924 --> 19:41.073
-Well, work faster!

19:42.053 --> 19:44.969
And if you encounter any more...glitches,

19:45.863 --> 19:47.381
notify me immediately.

19:48.398 --> 19:50.693
-Of course, sir. Prize truth.

19:52.043 --> 19:53.531
-Seek Harmony.

20:27.248 --> 20:29.083
-Oh, look at all this food.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.223
-Oh, god, what drugs did I take last night?

21:04.274 --> 21:05.687
-Someone's up early.

21:06.554 --> 21:08.554
Oh, I'm sorry, here, um...

21:08.579 --> 21:10.547
let me clean this up.

21:10.758 --> 21:12.066
Do you want any of this?

21:12.091 --> 21:14.261
-No, I...I'm good.
-Oh, OK.

21:14.868 --> 21:16.386
-Hey, need to talk to you

21:16.574 --> 21:17.726
about last night.

21:18.306 --> 21:20.225
-Oh, about like the door bell?

21:20.911 --> 21:21.943
No, before that.

21:23.313 --> 21:25.482
Listen, I didn't mean to call you a brat.

21:26.939 --> 21:31.366
-Oh, um...yeah. I'm sure  we both said
things we didn't mean.

21:32.545 --> 21:33.880
-That's mature of you.

21:34.404 --> 21:37.422
-Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day
we're still family, right?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.799
-Yeah, we are.

21:48.478 --> 21:51.613
-Oh, for Christ's sakes.  I can't believe
you're falling for this.

21:52.213 --> 21:53.878
-Listen, I gotta go to work, but

21:53.903 --> 21:54.838
we'll talk later?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.642
-OK, Yeah, bye.

21:59.556 --> 22:01.766
(thinking) I don't  know how
 long I can keep this up.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.739
-Finally!

22:36.605 --> 22:37.606
-Hey, Ava!

22:37.957 --> 22:40.222
Come on, babe, get in the car,
I want to talk to you!

22:40.359 --> 22:41.860
-I have somewhere else to be.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.822
-Let me take you!
 -I prefer walking.

22:47.135 --> 22:51.085
-Oh, don't be mad. 
Look, I'm sorry, alright?

22:51.110 --> 22:54.310
Alright? I was wasted all night. 
I get it; I shouldn't have left, I'm sorry.

22:56.154 --> 22:58.834
-You know, I... don't really 
want to discuss this.

22:59.475 --> 23:01.660
-Look, I said I was sorry, what
more do you want from me?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.000
-I want you to keep on driving.

23:04.846 --> 23:06.346
-You can't get rid
of me that easily.

23:06.510 --> 23:09.961
-Look, let me put this blunt to you, guy.

23:10.432 --> 23:14.059
Stay away. 
I never want to see you again ever.

23:16.085 --> 23:18.522
-Fine! 
If that's the way you want to be about  it.

23:18.547 --> 23:19.548
-It is!

23:26.194 --> 23:27.987
-No, Matt! Don't listen to her!

23:37.834 --> 23:38.940
How did I get in here?

23:41.003 --> 23:42.140
Why can't you see me?

23:56.894 --> 23:59.064
Look, I don't know what's going on,

23:59.111 --> 24:01.264
I'm gonna try to find 
out how to make it right.

24:35.388 --> 24:36.562
-Don't be a stranger.

24:36.879 --> 24:40.383
Excuse me, do you know the way
to the Piccadilly Circus?

24:42.207 --> 24:43.153
Too late.

24:43.734 --> 24:46.016
They've run out
of Blackbird pie.

24:46.105 --> 24:49.067
-My God!
 It is you.

24:49.953 --> 24:51.371
-Hi, Lancer.

24:54.498 --> 24:55.688
Surprise!

24:57.475 --> 25:01.038
Wow, you hit the jackpot. Where did
you find that vessel?

25:03.064 --> 25:06.623
-At some sort of fraternity
hazing ritual, gone south.

25:10.492 --> 25:12.308
you know, and I thought my
vessel was young.

25:14.962 --> 25:19.414
-Yeah, I know, drug overdose.
Can you believe?

25:22.602 --> 25:23.620
-I'm sorry.

25:25.081 --> 25:30.128
I mean...that's actually sad, poor kid.

25:31.223 --> 25:32.390
-Yeah.

25:32.415 --> 25:33.840
So, what are you gonna do?

25:33.992 --> 25:35.948
I don't know, I
can't just leave.

25:35.996 --> 25:39.617
Because the kid would be gone, and
the mom will come searching for me.

25:40.142 --> 25:42.250
-And create a bunch of  unwanted attention.

25:42.609 --> 25:47.750
Exactly. You know HQ  needs to
really work in refining the jump system.

25:47.907 --> 25:52.156
I know  selections are limited. 
But this? This is ridiculous.

25:52.182 --> 25:54.758
-Maybe somebody at
base camp will have some ideas. Hmm?

25:55.213 --> 25:56.214
-Yeah.

25:57.415 --> 26:00.008
-We should probably go check in.
-Yes let's go.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.368
-You folks lost or something?

26:17.527 --> 26:21.037
-Uh, is...is this the
way to Piccadilly Circus ?

26:21.066 --> 26:24.980
-You're too late.
We're done run out of Blackbird pie.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.590
-We'll come back yesterday,
before they're all gone.

26:28.695 --> 26:32.652
-You must be new, I don't
recognize those skins.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.344
-Agent Lancer.

26:35.970 --> 26:36.971
-Agent Seattle.

26:37.379 --> 26:40.675
-Agent Derby. Welcome to our
little corner of paradise.

26:40.918 --> 26:42.352
-Um, we've seen worse.

26:42.398 --> 26:46.254
-Don't get me wrong. It's
better than being Uptime.

26:47.051 --> 26:53.088
But I heard that the Pacific
unit is in a mansion in Bel Air.

26:53.393 --> 26:54.606
Bel Air!

26:54.807 --> 26:58.424
Whose ass do you have to
kiss to get that assignment?

26:59.510 --> 27:01.235
We should put this on the
list for the next jump..

27:01.353 --> 27:03.143
-Let's get through this one first.

27:04.808 --> 27:07.433
-Oh, you got stuck
with a kid, huh?

27:07.488 --> 27:09.565
Too bad. You should ask the
captain for a new skin.

27:09.962 --> 27:10.855
-You can do that?

27:10.940 --> 27:15.393
-Well, let me tell you, I've
seen some really bad jumps over the years.

27:15.511 --> 27:18.596
One vessel was
decapitated in a car accident.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.296
That was  messy
-OK, I get it.

27:21.767 --> 27:25.471
-See? The kid thing is sounding
better and better all the time.

27:25.850 --> 27:26.851
-Wanna trade?

27:28.967 --> 27:29.968
-No, thanks.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.707
-Agent Seattle? Agent Lancer.
-Sir.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.489
-I'm Captain Suthers. Thank you for making
the jump on such short notice.

27:48.695 --> 27:50.015
We're happy to help.

27:50.508 --> 27:52.334
How is the 21st century
treating you so far?

27:52.694 --> 27:55.359
-I can't  complain, the air is clean.

27:55.985 --> 27:58.586
-Oh, have you tried orange juice? 
It's amazing.

27:58.930 --> 27:59.955
-Enjoy it while it lasts.

28:00.206 --> 28:01.845
Come on, I'll give
you the Nickel tour.

28:02.330 --> 28:03.875
While some other
stations are more

28:03.900 --> 28:05.684
of your typical bang
and burn operation,

28:05.709 --> 28:08.004
our emphasis is on executive action.

28:15.647 --> 28:18.025
-What is this place?

28:25.152 --> 28:27.055
-This will give you a
sense of what we're up against.

28:27.838 --> 28:28.838
-Whoa.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.882
-Jesus, I didn't realize that Cabal had so
 many operatives in this timezone

28:35.907 --> 28:37.867
They havenâ€™t consolidated
their power structures yet.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.139
They're still hindered by
national boundaries,

28:40.140 --> 28:42.867
which makes it easier for us  to cut
their legs off from under them.

28:43.357 --> 28:45.226
You aren't afraid of getting 
your hands dirty, are you?

28:47.348 --> 28:49.109
-Not at all.
-Good.

29:00.470 --> 29:01.600
-Who are you people?

29:05.134 --> 29:07.592
-HQ knows we can't compete
with the Cabal Uptime.

29:08.427 --> 29:10.549
They are bigger than us  and have
unlimited resources.

29:12.719 --> 29:15.384
But here downtime, it's
a level playing field.

29:15.409 --> 29:16.372
Isn't that right?

29:17.725 --> 29:19.894
-Whoa! What have I said about
 the sneaking and the touching?

29:20.175 --> 29:21.385
This vessel is very sensitive.

29:22.353 --> 29:24.735
-Agent Paseo  will get you started
 with the data dump.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.345
-The process itself is painless,

29:26.422 --> 29:28.994
But it will give a hell of a migraine.

29:30.947 --> 29:33.620
-Oh, oh, Captain, if it's not  
too much to ask,

29:34.054 --> 29:37.079
the guard mentioned the possibility 
of getting a replacement vessel?

29:37.884 --> 29:40.745
This is too young for field work.

29:41.418 --> 29:43.412
-Especially if the two of you 
are gonna be working together.

29:44.247 --> 29:45.723
We don't want to raise too many questions.
-Hmm-hm.

29:47.129 --> 29:49.840
-Wait, So does that mean
 I can I get my body back?

29:50.453 --> 29:52.875
I'll put in a  transfer request.
-Oh, thank you sir.

29:54.563 --> 29:55.364
-What?

29:56.046 --> 29:58.256
So, but wait, how long id
 it for a replacement?

29:58.381 --> 30:00.573
Are you talking  hours? Days?

30:02.394 --> 30:04.939
-Ladies first.

30:07.283 --> 30:11.145
I'm just gonna do a quick memory scan.

30:11.319 --> 30:13.916
See what kind of goodies
you brought back.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.856
Here we go.

30:17.192 --> 30:18.192
Alright.

30:18.913 --> 30:21.133
There we go.

30:23.791 --> 30:27.111
Hopefully you'll do better
 than the last jumper,

30:27.479 --> 30:30.018
who apparently had a thing for cat videos.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.333
I'm more of a dog lover myself.

30:36.913 --> 30:37.955
Right.

30:45.636 --> 30:48.157
Alright now we're cooking with main power.

30:51.226 --> 30:52.227
OK.

30:54.965 --> 30:55.965
Ooh..

31:01.934 --> 31:05.463
Hello, gorgeous. 
Where have you been all my life?

31:08.847 --> 31:11.518
-I really wish you could hear me!
-Nightingale.

31:11.711 --> 31:13.092
I have a new broadcast for you.

31:21.659 --> 31:22.635
-Right away, captain.

31:25.699 --> 31:26.862
17.

31:27.972 --> 31:29.599
54.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.496
7.

31:32.350 --> 31:33.434
95.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.118
<i>28.</i>

31:38.302 --> 31:39.283
<i>43.</i>

31:40.840 --> 31:44.162
-I intercepted an incoming
rebel transmission.

31:44.421 --> 31:45.551
Sending it now.

31:46.014 --> 31:47.314
<i>-29.</i>

31:48.950 --> 31:50.314
<i>35.</i>

31:53.038 --> 31:54.329
<i>54.</i>

31:55.361 --> 31:56.716
<i>7.</i>
-What is it?

31:57.376 --> 31:59.477
-Coordinates,American Southwest.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.183
Early 21st century,
right Before the last world war.

32:02.208 --> 32:04.172
-What do we know about
this timezone?"

32:04.547 --> 32:06.210
-It matches the rebels' profile, alright.

32:06.261 --> 32:08.805
Accidents, suicides,
suspicious deaths.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.156
-How did we miss this cluster?

32:11.337 --> 32:12.988
-All the victims were
low-level players, sir.

32:13.013 --> 32:14.197
No one of any real significance.

32:14.392 --> 32:16.025
-Damn it, we don't know that!

32:16.688 --> 32:19.248
50 years ago, we were
all young officers!

32:19.682 --> 32:22.143
Hell I could be on their list!
Or you.

32:22.319 --> 32:24.614
And nobody around here 
would notice our absence.

32:24.699 --> 32:28.119
Sir, do you know how difficult
it is to monitor all of downtime?

32:28.339 --> 32:29.869
The past is a big place.

32:30.408 --> 32:32.444
And it's about to
get a lot smaller.

32:34.095 --> 32:35.305
Send in the hunter.

32:45.567 --> 32:50.059
<i>- Hunter Alpha Charlie 42, report
to the stasis chambers immediately.</i>

32:59.269 --> 33:02.844
-Deputy Minister, 
I didn't expect to see you here.

33:03.770 --> 33:06.081
Where is the usual jump technician?

33:06.592 --> 33:08.263
-I gave him the day off. Come in.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.715
There's something I wanted 
to show you personally.

33:16.681 --> 33:18.849
-It doesn't look like much.
-Don't be so dismissive

33:19.540 --> 33:21.240
The design was kept
intentionally simple to avoid

33:21.265 --> 33:23.305
suspicion from local
authorities authorities.

33:23.606 --> 33:27.117
Trust me. 
It packs one hell of a punch.

33:28.008 --> 33:28.937
-What is it?

33:29.221 --> 33:31.408
-Something new. We want you 
to beta est it out on the field.

33:32.161 --> 33:34.591
All of this is top
secret,of course.

33:34.820 --> 33:36.126
-I can keep a secret.

33:36.391 --> 33:37.392
-Good.

33:42.114 --> 33:45.399
-I like it, the rebels will
never know what hit them.

33:45.755 --> 33:49.086
-That is the idea.
Can you recreate it downtime?

33:52.974 --> 33:53.975
-Oh yeah.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.058
-Are you ready?

34:07.226 --> 34:08.768
-Let's go kill us some Skinners.

34:14.675 --> 34:15.676
-Prize truth.

34:15.972 --> 34:17.221
-Seek Harmony.

34:57.613 --> 34:59.405
I guess this vessel will do.

35:22.452 --> 35:25.687
-Hey Y'alls, 
Be right careful  out there. You hear?

35:29.498 --> 35:30.540
-How's your head?

35:31.103 --> 35:34.149
-It feels like Paseo just split it
open with a jackhammer.

35:34.367 --> 35:35.952
and filled it back in with concrete.

35:36.070 --> 35:38.054
-I don't remember the recruiter
mentioning this part.

35:39.203 --> 35:43.332
"Be a temporal agent,"He said, 
"change the world." He said.

35:44.674 --> 35:46.811
-Maybe we were out  sick that day.

35:48.136 --> 35:51.889
We were out sick a lot.
-That was my favorite part of training.

35:53.227 --> 35:54.229
-Mine too.

36:33.963 --> 36:39.146
-Nice night for a walk.
- This is  my favorite part of the city.

36:39.754 --> 36:41.912
It was better before
the Skinners moved in.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.846
-You are in violation of
temporal ordnance 19.8-4,

37:05.087 --> 37:08.048
time-travel with the intent
of changing the future.

37:08.073 --> 37:09.073
How do you plead?

37:09.098 --> 37:12.278
-We will destroy the
Cabal before it even begins.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.942
-Guilty it is.

37:14.154 --> 37:16.185
-What are you going to do? Shoot me?

37:16.960 --> 37:20.439
If you kill this vessel, I'll
just come back in a new skin.

37:20.843 --> 37:22.425
-That was the old way,

37:22.707 --> 37:26.660
it was kind of like playing
"Whack-a mole" back then.

37:28.651 --> 37:29.997
We do not play that game anymore.

37:37.178 --> 37:39.017
See you Uptime. Skinner.

37:43.737 --> 37:46.270
Poor little Skinner has no skin.

37:46.599 --> 37:49.290
How does she keep
her insides in?

37:59.328 --> 38:01.593
I'd like to report a
vermin infestation.

38:01.744 --> 38:04.294
Please send someone to this location
at your earliest convenience.

38:17.514 --> 38:21.226
-The fugitive is in custody,
ready for interrogation.

38:22.590 --> 38:25.077
<i>-What is it, Brewer?</i>
-The test was a success.

38:25.472 --> 38:27.585
We have one of the rebels in custody.
<i>-Excellent.</i>

38:27.733 --> 38:30.632
-Yes, sir. We are bringing him in for
 interrogation now.

38:32.448 --> 38:34.827
-I don't  like you staying here.
You are too exposed.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.073
-I'll be fine.

38:37.229 --> 38:40.179
The mom's harmless and
the boyfriend's just...

38:40.204 --> 38:41.330
-Boyfriend?

38:42.192 --> 38:44.459
 Do I need to take care of it?
-Already did .

38:47.575 --> 38:49.260
What?
-Nothing.

38:50.364 --> 38:53.473
-You can't fool me, no
matter what skin you're in.

38:53.695 --> 38:54.897
Something's bothering you.

38:54.922 --> 38:56.632
-It's just...it's only been a day.

38:58.509 --> 39:00.481
That new vessel can't come soon enough.

39:04.684 --> 39:06.788
-We only have to
wait a couple of weeks.

39:09.133 --> 39:11.171
-I'll be by in the morning
to pick you up, OK?

39:11.658 --> 39:13.208
-Alright, it's a date.

39:38.504 --> 39:39.839
-This sucks.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.394
I can't...

40:04.552 --> 40:06.079
It's working.

40:25.853 --> 40:26.979
Is it you, Ava?

40:28.054 --> 40:29.523
-You're still  here, aren't you?

40:31.251 --> 40:33.335
I do not know how much you can understand,

40:33.380 --> 40:35.720
but just know that this is
a part of something big.

40:36.131 --> 40:38.898
An I wouldn't  be here if
it wasn't really important.

40:41.046 --> 40:43.991
I'm Sorry. 
I'm so sorry that you're dead.

40:44.151 --> 40:46.792
-I'm not dead! 
I'm gonna find a way to get back!

40:53.883 --> 40:56.554
-Hey,Ava!
-I don't have time for this.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.288
-You literally just told me you love me and
now you're blowing me off?

41:00.617 --> 41:01.786
What's gong on with you?

41:01.820 --> 41:03.396
Ever since that party 
you've been acting weird.

41:03.922 --> 41:05.565
-Then move on, good talking to you.

41:05.590 --> 41:07.515
-Is he bothering you?
-No, He's just leaving.

41:08.839 --> 41:12.132
-And who is this guy?
-Listen, Junior.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.701
You should know when a lady's
 not interested, right?

41:16.643 --> 41:18.301
Hit the bricks.
 -Lancer, knock it off."

41:19.066 --> 41:19.787
-Lancer?

41:20.851 --> 41:23.593
OK. You need to make a
choice right now.

41:24.037 --> 41:25.655
It's either him or it's me.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.914
-Don't ever give a girl
an ultimatum. Let's go.

41:44.954 --> 41:46.460
Alright, what is it?

41:47.381 --> 41:48.798
-I don't like that guy.

41:49.842 --> 41:52.476
-He's a kid, he's harmless.
-He's trouble.

41:52.892 --> 41:56.083
-You're jealous.
-I saw the way he looked at you.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.359
It's only temporary, okay?

42:00.690 --> 42:03.869
Stay focused. 
Let's do what we came here to do.

42:10.525 --> 42:13.304
-Do either of you know what
this is or what it's supposed to do?

42:13.603 --> 42:16.272
No. We just intercepted an
encrypted transmission.

42:16.648 --> 42:19.187
-The Cabal used a
256-bit key cipher.

42:19.362 --> 42:22.781
So, whatever that thing does, they don't
 want it to become public knowledge.

42:22.876 --> 42:25.378
-Well, it's clearly intended
to be used downtime.

42:25.503 --> 42:26.546
-How can you tell?

42:26.926 --> 42:31.226
-The design is simple enough
that a single  hunter could memorize it.

42:31.478 --> 42:34.523
And the components are all
readily available in this timezone.

42:34.628 --> 42:39.196
The only tricky
part is this magnetron.

42:39.221 --> 42:42.728
But those are available
 in any microwave oven.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.730
-So you can actually build this?

42:45.449 --> 42:46.451
-In for doodles.

42:48.312 --> 42:50.488
-Does anyone doubt?
-I think that means yes.

42:50.614 --> 42:52.325
Whole shit in the woods?

42:52.380 --> 42:55.616
If a tree falls in the woods,
do leprechauns come out of my butt?

43:02.349 --> 43:04.499
-Has anyone heard from agent Nightingale?

43:08.162 --> 43:10.281
It's unusual for her to not check in.

43:29.756 --> 43:31.361
-I love technology.

43:32.874 --> 43:37.271
Do you remember  how hard it was
questioning rebels in the old days?

43:37.880 --> 43:40.090
It took a long drawn out process.

43:40.637 --> 43:44.954
Starvation, sleep deprivation,
beatings, torture...

43:45.942 --> 43:48.865
And even then, the Intel was usually
used to be wrong.

43:49.433 --> 43:51.436
This is so much more efficient.

43:52.226 --> 43:56.021
- I do miss the screams, though.
Just not the same without them.

43:57.706 --> 43:59.513
-Aha! There they are!

44:00.400 --> 44:02.191
You see how simple that was?

44:03.431 --> 44:06.467
Well, it was nice working
 with you, my dear,

44:07.146 --> 44:08.891
but your services are
no longer needed.

44:16.984 --> 44:19.321
Well, let's go pay a visit to our
rebel friends.

44:29.574 --> 44:30.701
-Oh no!

44:38.731 --> 44:39.712
-Suthers speaking.

44:42.814 --> 44:43.912
Are you sure it's her?

44:45.527 --> 44:46.571
Yeah.

44:47.509 --> 44:48.511
Yeah.

44:50.116 --> 44:51.254
Thank you for letting me know.

44:53.505 --> 44:56.975
Some time last night, Agent
Nightingale was attacked.

44:58.341 --> 45:00.295
Her empty vessel
was found in an alley.

45:02.733 --> 45:05.158
Here.
-Was it random?

45:06.295 --> 45:08.654
-Nothing was stolen and
there is no sign of trauma.

45:09.411 --> 45:12.581
We have reason to believe
that cabal has anew hunter

45:12.808 --> 45:14.518
operating in this timezone.

45:15.661 --> 45:18.592
As of right now, our
number one priority

45:18.817 --> 45:22.199
is to find and eliminate this hunter.

45:23.313 --> 45:26.060
We need to retrace
Nightingale's final steps.

45:27.327 --> 45:30.881
I want footage from every
cameras in a two-block radius.

45:32.616 --> 45:34.952
This hunter has a face,

45:36.339 --> 45:40.323
By the end of today I want it plastered
up on that wall

45:41.196 --> 45:42.307
for everyone to see.

45:43.529 --> 45:48.784
And by tomorrow, I want it covered with a
big red X.

45:48.888 --> 45:50.748
Am I understood?

45:51.126 --> 45:52.419
-Sir,yes, sir!

45:52.543 --> 45:55.454
-We will send the
Cabal a message:

45:55.479 --> 46:00.930
"We are armed,
weâ€™re trained and we are ready!"

46:01.393 --> 46:04.493
Now let's go find this asshole
 and bring them down!

46:04.850 --> 46:05.850
-Yeah!

46:08.517 --> 46:11.062
-We might  have one small problem.
 -What is it, Paseo?

46:11.087 --> 46:14.892
-Cabal has a new toy, and it's nasty.

46:37.664 --> 46:39.151
-This tech is so primitive.

46:41.467 --> 46:43.302
How are we supposed to
 ID anybody with this?

46:45.561 --> 46:48.893
What do you think happens to
our vessels receptacles when they die?

46:49.729 --> 46:51.048
To their spirit, I mean.

46:51.550 --> 46:53.011
-I don't...I don't know.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.104
I mean, we are all made of energy.

46:58.266 --> 47:01.869
When it gets released, it goes back
into the cosmos, I suppose?

47:05.604 --> 47:08.645
Or were you looking for
 a more heaven and hell,

47:08.785 --> 47:10.912
"Is there life after death?
" kind of answer?

47:11.849 --> 47:13.440
-I don't know, but...

47:15.296 --> 47:18.843
You can't tell anyone, but I
think my new skin is a  remnant.

47:20.571 --> 47:21.780
-What would make
 you say that?

47:21.834 --> 47:25.548
-I've seen things, like  messages on
my computer screen, and...

47:25.777 --> 47:28.830
-Do not let that kind
of talk get out.

47:29.556 --> 47:31.041
It's dangerous.

47:31.330 --> 47:33.218
-Do you think I don't know that?

47:33.706 --> 47:36.361
At first, I thought I was being
 paranoid or delusional

47:36.386 --> 47:39.529
you know,  first jump stuff, but
now I don't know.

47:43.978 --> 47:46.015
I think it was a premature jump.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.201
Shit! You mean
she wasn't dead yet?

47:48.750 --> 47:52.226
-I don't  know, maybe. Why else
 would she be here?

47:52.251 --> 47:54.311
-You know that remnants
can't officially exist. "

47:54.336 --> 47:55.743
-Yeah, but if she wasn't
dead yet..."

47:55.768 --> 47:57.485
-So if the girl is a remnant,

47:59.060 --> 48:01.559
that means that somebody at
headquarters messed up big time.

48:03.269 --> 48:04.620
But they will never admit that.

48:05.974 --> 48:07.479
They will pin it on you first.

48:08.003 --> 48:11.335
-Do you think they'll ground me?
-Um-hmm.

48:12.016 --> 48:13.426
And then we will never
see each other again.

48:13.867 --> 48:14.948
Do you understand?

48:15.540 --> 48:18.722
So, before you go telling
anybody else just wait.

48:19.518 --> 48:22.855
You know, maybe...maybe you'll
feel different in a new skin.

48:23.886 --> 48:25.066
-I hope so.

48:33.704 --> 48:35.456
Captain! We found a match.

48:41.155 --> 48:44.520
-Zoom in. I want to see
what this son of a bitch looks like.

48:48.642 --> 48:51.067
Well, I'll be damned.

48:58.089 --> 49:00.924
-Hello, Matthew. Ava is not here.

49:01.174 --> 49:03.636
-Actually, I'm here to see you.
-Me?

49:03.902 --> 49:04.923
-Yes, ma'am.

49:05.080 --> 49:08.142
There's something about
Ava that, as her mother,

49:08.673 --> 49:10.384
I think you ought to know.

49:51.435 --> 49:54.069
-So this thing is like a
prison for souls?

49:54.373 --> 49:55.829
-In a nutshell, yes.

49:56.712 --> 49:57.721
How do we stop it?

49:57.812 --> 50:00.974
Well, we don't. 
Not yet, anyway.

50:01.145 --> 50:03.169
There's a problem with the prototype,

50:03.194 --> 50:06.213
there's a flaw with the compact symmetries
and compilers.

50:06.468 --> 50:08.178
-Have you tried to reverse the polarity?

50:11.165 --> 50:13.132
-I need to go back
through the data dump

50:13.157 --> 50:14.837
and see if there's something
that I'm missing.

50:15.058 --> 50:17.099
-Um, so what are we gonna 
do about the hunter?

50:17.883 --> 50:20.247
-My advice? Stay away.

50:21.635 --> 50:22.968
-Why are you doing this?

50:23.393 --> 50:26.819
Come on,it's too dangerous. You're
better off staying at my place.

50:26.912 --> 50:30.767
-And risk you going to jail,
for kidnapping or even worse? No

50:30.905 --> 50:34.826
-There's a hunter on the streets,
-Then I'll stay off the streets.

50:41.474 --> 50:42.844
-I can't lose you.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.997
-Don't worry.the second
my new transfer comes in,

50:47.022 --> 50:48.892
I'll be at your door,
with my bags packed

50:48.989 --> 50:50.845
Until then, this is our best option.

51:14.078 --> 51:16.425
-Who was that?
-A friend.

51:17.023 --> 51:21.237
-You know it's  not health for a grown man 
to be hanging around with a 15 year old.

51:21.782 --> 51:22.865
-OK, mother.

51:23.690 --> 51:25.626
-Are you dealing drugs?
-Jesus, no.

51:25.651 --> 51:26.792
Did you have sex with him?

51:26.817 --> 51:28.642
I'm not having this
conversation right now.

51:29.161 --> 51:30.579
-Was that  Lancer?

51:33.447 --> 51:36.533
-How did you know his name?
I saw your chat messages.

51:37.104 --> 51:38.671
-You were in my room?
-You were in my room?

51:39.124 --> 51:41.126
-I don't want you seeing him anymore.

51:41.276 --> 51:42.857
-I told you. I'm not talking
about this right now.

51:43.509 --> 51:45.195
-This isn't a game, Ava!

51:45.485 --> 51:46.982
You think that he loves you,

51:47.086 --> 51:50.820
and that he's gonna take care of you and
you're gonna live happily ever after?

51:50.902 --> 51:53.266
Wake up! This is reality.

51:53.948 --> 51:56.473
You're gonna
wake up one day my age,

51:56.498 --> 52:00.046
and have a teenager that hates
you because you are never there for her.

52:00.205 --> 52:03.945
Then, to punish you,
you'll keep making the same mistakes.

52:04.166 --> 52:06.288
The same mistakes that I did.

52:06.313 --> 52:10.380
It's like watching your own failures 
over and over again and

52:10.405 --> 52:12.278
there isn't a damn thing 
you can do about it.

52:13.193 --> 52:14.695
-I am not a failure.
-I am not a failure.

52:32.235 --> 52:34.778
-So, it looks like someone is
scheduled for a replacement.

52:37.782 --> 52:38.950
Oh, shit!

53:02.033 --> 53:04.829
-Move, move! Go back! I'll cover you! Go!

53:19.274 --> 53:20.709
-Hey!

53:46.315 --> 53:48.912
-I've located the rebel sleepers.

53:52.421 --> 53:54.235
Notify the Chief Minister.

53:59.486 --> 54:03.385
The vermin has been exterminated.

54:16.702 --> 54:17.996
What's the matter?-

54:20.711 --> 54:23.589
Baby? Baby, what's wrong?

54:24.166 --> 54:25.264
-It hurts.

54:25.310 --> 54:27.729
-Hold on. I'm gonna take you 
to the Emergency Room.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.710
-No! No doctors.

54:30.132 --> 54:31.749
-You need help, you're sick.

54:31.774 --> 54:33.736
-No! I'll be OK.

54:34.027 --> 54:38.655
I'm OK, see? I'm sorry I woke you up.

54:43.181 --> 54:45.011
-I didn't mean what I said earlier.

54:47.002 --> 54:48.171
-You're not a failure.

54:48.948 --> 54:51.184
You're my daughter and
I love you very much.

54:51.773 --> 54:52.814
-I love you, too.

55:03.316 --> 55:04.318
-I love you.

55:18.699 --> 55:22.597
"Let your plans be dark and
impenetrable as the night.

55:23.092 --> 55:26.682
And when you move, fall
like a thunderbolt."

55:27.739 --> 55:30.240
Did you ever read Sun Tzu, The
Art of War?

55:30.583 --> 55:32.876
written in
the 5th century BC?

55:33.559 --> 55:36.153
The greatest military
treatise ever written.

55:36.473 --> 55:41.799
-I can't say That I have.
-Well, maybe now you won't have to."

55:44.111 --> 55:47.998
We've finally reached the brink of peace.

55:48.802 --> 55:52.306
-What is going on there?
-Say something!

55:52.643 --> 55:54.605
- Say something!
-Everyone, please!

55:55.230 --> 55:57.963
Just calm down. This isn't helping.

56:00.416 --> 56:04.757
The details are sketchy but there was
an attack on base uptime/

56:04.820 --> 56:06.530
-What about the stasis chamber?

56:07.212 --> 56:09.711
-Destroyed.
-And the sleepers?

56:10.373 --> 56:11.917
-You already know that answer.

56:13.157 --> 56:16.595
-So you are  saying  we are
trapped in this timezone?

56:16.620 --> 56:18.073
-For the foreseeable future.

56:18.416 --> 56:21.461
I don't expect reinforcements 
to arrive any time soon,

56:24.009 --> 56:25.092
or exchange them.

56:28.050 --> 56:31.488
Yes, this is a setback, I'm not gonna lie.

56:32.610 --> 56:34.644
But it doesn't change our mission.

56:36.368 --> 56:40.998
This latest act of aggression
is proof we're a threat.

56:42.574 --> 56:46.602
The Cabal  know  we have
the power to change the future,

56:47.829 --> 56:50.019
to rewrite them out of  history.

56:51.254 --> 56:54.249
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

56:54.914 --> 56:56.812
Tomorrow we will mourn,

56:57.484 --> 57:00.610
but today we are going to go
back to our work stations

57:00.833 --> 57:04.503
and  find a way to
take these bastards out.

57:04.840 --> 57:07.915
Now let's go do it!
-Yeah!

57:08.802 --> 57:10.804
-Hey, where are you going?
 I need some air.

57:12.509 --> 57:15.971
-Get that  prototype working  ASAP.
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.833
-Seattle!

57:26.195 --> 57:29.114
-Everything alright?
 -I'm OK, I just need a minute.

57:30.055 --> 57:32.307
-We can leave, right now, just you and me.

57:33.595 --> 57:35.454
-And go where? You heard the Captain. 
We're trapped.

57:35.572 --> 57:38.491
-We will start a new life, away from the 
Cabal and away from the Huntress.

57:38.898 --> 57:41.152
-And abandon the mission?
-Think about it.

57:41.380 --> 57:46.381
-If the mission was actually successful,
if the Cabal never existed,

57:46.407 --> 57:49.162
There would have no reason to send us 
back to this timezone in the first place.

57:50.449 --> 57:53.869
-What are you saying?
- The rebellion failed.

57:55.797 --> 58:00.536
It always fails,it has to, or else
we wouldn't be here.

58:00.678 --> 58:03.013
-No,no,no...
Has to be another way to change things.

58:03.123 --> 58:05.419
Otherwise it's pointless.

58:05.724 --> 58:08.183
-If we leave right now, 
we might have a chance.

58:09.197 --> 58:12.951
-A chance to do what? Stand back
and watch history repeat itself?

58:13.432 --> 58:16.868
You and I both know how this story goes
and it doesn't have a good ending.

58:18.155 --> 58:19.715
And I'm gonna give it one.

58:20.182 --> 58:22.233
-Seattle. Seattle, wait!

58:24.825 --> 58:25.833
Shit.

58:26.653 --> 58:30.908
-Troubles with your lady friend?
-It's complicated.

58:33.027 --> 58:37.213
-Ain't nothing complicated about love.
It's either you do or you don't.

58:38.088 --> 58:39.714
It don't get much simpler than that.

58:40.173 --> 58:43.859
But life, on the other hand, now that
will trip you up every time.

58:45.166 --> 58:48.128
-Yeah? So what do you do when
 life gets in the way of love? Huh?

58:49.878 --> 58:53.006
-Sometimes life makes our choices- for us.

59:02.933 --> 59:04.137
-Hey, it's OK.

59:04.858 --> 59:05.823
-I just don't get it.

59:06.357 --> 59:08.381
I thought things were going so
 good between us, you know?

59:09.220 --> 59:11.055
-Matt? Circe?

59:12.029 --> 59:13.614
-I know, she blew us both off.

59:14.389 --> 59:15.686
-Something  changed.

59:16.524 --> 59:19.151
I can't help but think about
the last time I saw her and

59:20.120 --> 59:21.128
She just wasn't herself.

59:22.751 --> 59:24.819
I know how to get you
to stop thinking about her.

59:25.878 --> 59:26.776
-What?

59:35.288 --> 59:36.790
-You bitch!

59:48.431 --> 59:50.419
Do not stand at my grave and weep.

59:51.035 --> 59:53.676
I am not there, I do not sleep,

59:54.239 --> 59:56.824
I am the thousand winds that blow.

59:57.137 --> 59:59.791
I am the diamond that glints in the snow.

01:00:00.395 --> 01:00:05.776
I am the sunlight of ripened grain,
I am the gentle autumn rain.

01:00:09.803 --> 01:00:12.307
When you awaken with morning's hush,

01:00:12.332 --> 01:00:17.113
I am the swift uplifting rush of
 quiet birds and circled fire.

01:00:17.992 --> 01:00:20.572
I am the soft stars
that shine at night.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:23.435
Do not stand at my grave and cry.

01:00:23.974 --> 01:00:27.102
I am not there, I did not die.

01:00:27.676 --> 01:00:29.556
-We can't compete with the Cabal Uptime.

01:00:30.174 --> 01:00:32.674
They are bigger than us and have unlimited
resources.

01:00:33.726 --> 01:00:35.962
If you're not gonna help me,
I'll find someone who will.

01:00:41.181 --> 01:00:42.182
You.

01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:47.564
Hunter.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:52.652
-I found you.

01:00:57.734 --> 01:00:58.986
-You're not a Skinner.

01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:07.312
What are you?

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.841
This?

01:01:21.097 --> 01:01:22.307
Do you know where they are?

01:01:24.268 --> 01:01:25.394
Can you take me to them?

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:41.119
<i>-Are you lost?</i>
-No. I'm right where I need to be.

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.062
-Paseo, how are we coming
on that  prototype?

01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:00.780
Hide!

01:02:02.921 --> 01:02:04.423
-Captain, are you OK?

01:02:05.766 --> 01:02:06.768
Hunter!

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:24.842
-Hey, who turned out the lights?

01:02:30.939 --> 01:02:31.941
-Sir!

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.510
-Shit!

01:02:43.346 --> 01:02:44.806
Oh, double shit!

01:02:49.143 --> 01:02:51.428
-It's clean. The bullet passed
 all the way through.

01:02:53.049 --> 01:02:54.104
-That's our lucky day.

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:57.327
-We're gonna need to apply 
pressure to keep it from bleeding.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.428
-Paseo, what is that?

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:04.749
-A polymorphic virus.

01:03:07.227 --> 01:03:09.113
If the Cabal tries
to access our data,

01:03:09.191 --> 01:03:10.881
it will wipe the servers

01:03:11.324 --> 01:03:12.450
and take us out with it.

01:03:14.377 --> 01:03:15.879
-How long does that take?

01:03:15.962 --> 01:03:18.466
-Longer than we probably have.

01:03:20.413 --> 01:03:21.831
OK, OK.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.357
You'll keep this safe, won't you?
-Nipper doodles.

01:03:35.934 --> 01:03:37.349
-Go. I'll distract her.

01:04:02.842 --> 01:04:05.804
-Sad little Skinner, all alone.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.150
Time to fly away.

01:04:08.897 --> 01:04:10.274
Fly away.

01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:12.769
Fly away home.

01:04:16.935 --> 01:04:19.234
- Maybe he got her?
-Let's go.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.065
-There is a whole nest of 
vermin at this location.

01:05:00.732 --> 01:05:02.115
Please send someone to clean them up.

01:05:34.016 --> 01:05:35.018
-Oh my God.

01:05:40.565 --> 01:05:41.787
-How does it look?

01:05:43.924 --> 01:05:44.926
-You'll live.

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:56.825
-What is he doing in here?
-It's not what it looks like.

01:05:57.084 --> 01:05:58.993
If you would just let me explain...

01:05:59.286 --> 01:06:01.293
-Whose blood is this?
-He was shot.

01:06:01.487 --> 01:06:04.138
-Uh-uh, I'm calling the cops on this one.

01:06:05.033 --> 01:06:06.035
-No cops.

01:06:08.425 --> 01:06:09.427
On your knees.

01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:13.557
-Ava, I don't even know 
who you are anymore.

01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:17.435
Keep an eye on her,
I'm gonna go find some rope.

01:06:23.729 --> 01:06:25.380
-You destroyed her life!

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:27.880
-it's not as simple as all that.

01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:33.534
If you are looking for
your skin,remnant, it's not here.

01:06:36.295 --> 01:06:39.885
Unless you know
where the skinner is who took it,

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.751
I'm afraid there's not 
much I can do to help.

01:06:46.949 --> 01:06:48.290
-Home.

01:06:50.119 --> 01:06:52.978
-Sorry about this, it would take
me too long to explain.

01:06:53.204 --> 01:06:54.931
And you would not believe me anyway.

01:06:55.599 --> 01:06:57.302
-Jesus, mom!

01:06:57.657 --> 01:06:58.729
What did you do?

01:06:59.143 --> 01:07:02.594
You're gonna regret this, Hunter.

01:07:07.383 --> 01:07:10.280
-Look who's back. 
Did you find your missing skin?

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.465
Are you sure that's where they are?

01:07:25.298 --> 01:07:26.355
Good job, kiddo.

01:07:34.503 --> 01:07:37.898
-There has to be other operatives
 in other time zones.

01:07:38.756 --> 01:07:41.462
-Didn't Derby say something
 about a Pacific unit?

01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:45.733
-Right, in Bel Air.
We just have to find them.

01:07:45.758 --> 01:07:48.302
-But how?
-Maybe something in here will help.

01:07:53.822 --> 01:07:54.906
What's going on?

01:07:55.286 --> 01:07:57.293
-It's Ava.
-She's here?

01:07:59.081 --> 01:08:00.874
-No, no, no.
- We need to go.Right now.

01:08:00.899 --> 01:08:03.958
-No, you can't go. You're hurt.
You need to rest.

01:08:09.326 --> 01:08:10.703
-Showtime.

01:08:16.694 --> 01:08:18.863
-What are you doing?
-She needs to know.

01:08:20.675 --> 01:08:24.761
-We're not supposed to share
knowledge of future events.

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:27.522
-Or what? What have we got to lose?

01:08:28.997 --> 01:08:32.376
-This is a really bad idea.
Think about what you are doing.

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:37.104
-Ava, I hope you're watching this.

01:08:39.362 --> 01:08:42.865
Take a good look because
 I want you to remember all of it.

01:08:43.562 --> 01:08:47.377
This is the future that you created.
You did this.

01:08:47.626 --> 01:08:51.870
By helping the Cabal, you've just signed a
death sentence for the whole world.

01:08:56.221 --> 01:08:56.964
-I'm sorry.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:00.557
I didn't know.

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:04.667
-Oh Shit. The hunter, she's here.

01:10:58.537 --> 01:10:59.537
-Oh, damn!

01:11:03.974 --> 01:11:04.974
-Hey!

01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:53.564
-Stop, it's no good.
I'm not giving up.

01:11:59.663 --> 01:12:00.664
-Come here.

01:12:08.885 --> 01:12:10.367
-One of us has to
make it to California.

01:12:11.992 --> 01:12:13.116
-I'm not going.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.370
I'm not leaving you.

01:12:17.347 --> 01:12:19.640
-Sometimes life makes our choices
for us, huh?

01:12:23.327 --> 01:12:24.494
Take this.

01:12:40.359 --> 01:12:41.944
Go, go.

01:12:45.576 --> 01:12:48.747
-I'm not afraid of you.
-Just admit when you've lost.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:52.588
-Theses last efforts at
heroics are pathetic.

01:12:59.193 --> 01:13:00.319
-Mom!

01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:12.391
-Now's not a good time.

01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:15.636
- You hurt my Mom.
-Out of my way, Remnant.

01:13:15.798 --> 01:13:16.954
-I thought you were trying to help.

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:19.863
-Move, or you'll never get your body back.

01:13:20.903 --> 01:13:25.214
Isn't this what you want?
To get back what she stole from you?

01:13:27.113 --> 01:13:29.446
-She didn't steal it. I threw it away.

01:13:29.779 --> 01:13:34.596
-Do you know what this is? It will work
on you just as well as Skinners.

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:38.280
-You're a Skinner, too.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.868
-No!

01:13:48.396 --> 01:13:49.898
Seattle...

01:13:54.838 --> 01:13:57.091
Seattle? Seattle.

01:13:57.354 --> 01:13:59.550
-Seattle.
-No, I'm Ava.

01:13:59.816 --> 01:14:00.817
-What?

01:14:01.829 --> 01:14:04.393
What? You can see  me? I'm back?

01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:06.320
-Seattle?

01:14:07.825 --> 01:14:09.702
Oh fuck. No.

01:14:11.856 --> 01:14:13.144
No.  No. No.

01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:24.497
Seattle, I'm gonna get
 you out of there, I promise.

01:14:30.014 --> 01:14:33.488
-I'm sorry.
She seemed like a good person.

01:14:36.059 --> 01:14:37.179
-She was.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.868
Tell me you know how to save her. Huh?

01:14:52.169 --> 01:14:53.462
Say it!

01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:56.962
Say it, or I'll slit your throat
right here and now.

01:14:57.524 --> 01:15:00.141
-Do you know the way to Piccadilly Circus?

01:15:00.966 --> 01:15:01.918
-What?

01:15:03.225 --> 01:15:04.036
What?

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:08.636
-You're supposed to say 'We've run
out of blackbird pie.'

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:12.851
Seattle?

01:15:13.687 --> 01:15:14.925
Seattle...

01:15:22.701 --> 01:15:23.955
-Com on, lets patch you up.

01:15:28.247 --> 01:15:31.807
-I know this is not gonna really 
make up for anything,

01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:36.000
but just trust me when I say
things will be better now.

01:15:36.513 --> 01:15:37.624
And I'm sorry.

01:15:37.957 --> 01:15:39.815
-Come here, honey, give me a hug.

01:16:02.779 --> 01:16:04.866
-Why are you keeping that?

01:16:06.031 --> 01:16:08.614
-"Keep your friends close
but your enemies closer".

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:13.935
What?

01:16:16.337 --> 01:16:17.338
-Nothing.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.009
It's just...

01:16:20.901 --> 01:16:23.482
It's a little weird.
 You're not trying to kill me.

01:16:24.228 --> 01:16:25.580
That's all. Yeah.

01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:28.842
-I'm sorry, is this Skin 
not good enough for you?

01:16:29.516 --> 01:16:32.185
Should I try to find another one?
-Oh, no. No, no, no...

01:16:32.985 --> 01:16:36.613
I approve.I approve of it very much.

01:16:53.038 --> 01:16:57.251
-Hi, um, look, everything has been
 really crazy lately.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.529
And I just want to say 
thank you for helping us.

01:17:01.373 --> 01:17:03.583
So, what are we gonna do now?

01:17:05.047 --> 01:17:07.475
-You? Just keep being young.

01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:11.930
Be yourself again. You're so lucky
you have a second chance.

01:17:12.731 --> 01:17:13.732
Don't let it slip away.

01:17:14.223 --> 01:17:16.392
-I don't think I can if I tried.

01:17:17.589 --> 01:17:19.407
So what are you guys gonna do?

01:17:20.485 --> 01:17:23.419
-We've got a lot of ground to cover
before we reach California,

01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:26.820
Ready?
-Yeah.

01:17:39.633 --> 01:17:40.925
-Do you guys have to leave?

01:17:41.469 --> 01:17:43.972
Eventually, the Cabal will
realize their Hunter is out of commission.

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:45.489
-Yeah, they will send others.

01:17:45.998 --> 01:17:48.718
So it will be safer for you
and your mom is we are

01:17:48.905 --> 01:17:50.397
far away when this happens.

01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:54.864
-Be careful out there.
 -Have a good life, Ava.

01:17:55.636 --> 01:17:57.137
-You, too, Seattle.

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:11.470
Mom, what's for breakfast?

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:36.985
