00:03.100 --> 00:06.320
aaa

00:07.700 --> 00:09.280
Hi.

00:11.060 --> 00:14.530
I'm doing crunches. You
got the money or not?

00:14.530 --> 00:17.120
Yes. Well,no.
Y-- some.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.250
But look,I think if you let me explain,

00:20.250 --> 00:22.810
You'd be a lot more
open to working this out.

00:22.810 --> 00:27.410
I've had an awful,awful
week,and please just hear me out.

00:27.410 --> 00:29.740
Fine. Move your face.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.250
I finished audrey hepburn's
ogbiography last night,

00:36.250 --> 00:37.740
And it totally inspired me.

00:37.740 --> 00:39.370
audrey hepburn--
she's so boring.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.010
I hated "breakfast at tiffany's.

00:41.010 --> 00:44.390
" But if you tell one gay person
I said that,I will deny it. I will.

00:44.390 --> 00:47.370
I promise. Anyway,audrey
basically gave up her stardom

00:47.370 --> 00:50.250
To go and do good in the
world,and it made me think.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.700
- I'm an editor now.
- Really?

00:52.700 --> 00:56.190
And I'm finally in a position
to tell stories like that--

00:56.190 --> 01:00.180
Stories about people who do
inspiring and selfless things.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.320
Well,here's your next assignment
From the powers that be.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.680
Inspiring?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.580
"the most comfortable stiletto"?

01:05.580 --> 01:06.810
Betty
suarez--

01:06.810 --> 01:10.410
keeping the dream alive
For hookers with hammertoe.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.140
<i>Fed***</i>

01:16.150 --> 01:18.520
I don't think I'll ever
get tired of those lips.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.910
Willie,don't you think
we're kidding ourselves here?

01:22.910 --> 01:24.090
Meaning?

01:24.090 --> 01:25.920
Meaning you can't
go on like this--

01:25.920 --> 01:27.810
Giving up an actual life in the world

01:27.810 --> 01:30.250
To visit me here in
this godforsaken place.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.660
I'm gonna be in here for
years. That's no life for you.

01:33.660 --> 01:34.780
Please.

01:34.780 --> 01:38.340
I've done much worse for much longer
And gotten much less out of it.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.400
I'm serious. You deserve more than this.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.990
Connor,I'm happy. Now stop it.

01:49.690 --> 01:51.570
30 minutes! That's it!

01:57.300 --> 02:00.090
I can't believe how many ads we
lost While hartley was in charge.

02:00.090 --> 02:02.610
Can we just talk a little more
about how much I hated him?

02:02.610 --> 02:05.810
Maybe later. So when we
shaving the beard,do you think?

02:05.810 --> 02:07.430
We are not. I like it.

02:07.430 --> 02:09.320
Hmm. We'll revisit.

02:10.810 --> 02:13.560
Daniel,I need marc,and you're
just gonna have to deal with it.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.290
Well,since you asked so
sweetly,How could I possibly say no?

02:17.290 --> 02:20.100
I'm sorry. I'm working like
an 8-year-old seamstress here

02:20.100 --> 02:21.870
***

02:21.870 --> 02:23.840
I don't have time to replace him now.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.830
Hmm,says the woman who strolls
in at,oh,look at that-- 11:00.

02:28.270 --> 02:31.060
I was visiting my sick aunt in jersey.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.560
You feel good about that crack now?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.910
Point being,you stole marc from me.

02:35.910 --> 02:38.960
The least you could do is share
him with me,just for a while.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.090
And how does marc feel about that?

02:42.250 --> 02:45.390
Uh,it's funny how you pretend
Like I have any say in it at all.

02:46.810 --> 02:49.500
Fine. But just for a while.

02:50.670 --> 02:54.120
Will there be extra
compensation For this extra work?

02:54.120 --> 02:55.580
I no longer feel betrayed by you.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.540
That's compensation enough.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.370
- giddyap.
- Right.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.360
- well,what have you been up to?
- Well,I know,you know,work is kind of slow...

03:05.500 --> 03:07.560
Sorry I'm late. do more charity work.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.830
charity work? What charity work?

03:09.830 --> 03:12.790
Well,I've been building
houses for happy homes.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.500
Yeah,a group of us go in,And
we build them with the people

03:15.500 --> 03:17.350
Who are actually gonna
be living in them.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.240
It's a great experience.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.650
Reminds me to be grateful.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.570
You're so good. I hate you.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.290
Me,too.

03:26.860 --> 03:29.040
Sorry. I was eavesdropping.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.090
Uh,I don't hate you. I love you.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.240
Actually,I don't know you,

03:32.240 --> 03:35.390
But I'm just grateful
that you do what you do.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.280
See,that's what I want
to be writing about--

03:39.280 --> 03:42.720
Stuff like that,people like
that who do things like that

03:42.720 --> 03:45.230
I'm sure I'll find a way to turn
"the most comfortable stiletto"

03:45.230 --> 03:46.570
Into something a little more me,

03:46.570 --> 03:48.060
But I have no idea what that's gonna be.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.830
But anyway,enough. How was your morni?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.380
Well,first yoga and a movie,

03:51.380 --> 03:53.680
Then I'm going to pick a
paint color for my walls--

03:53.680 --> 03:55.930
Swiss mocha or eggnog.

03:55.930 --> 03:58.870
See? You leaving "mode"
was really good for us,

03:58.870 --> 04:00.480
'cause before I would
have already known that.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.020
But now I'm like,ooh,what
color is he gonna choose?

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.140 --> 04:18.320
And then
it hit me--

04:18.320 --> 04:22.019
why don't I write a story Called
"walk a mile in her shoes"?

04:22.019 --> 04:25.510
I can feature a specific shoe
and then attach a personal story

04:25.510 --> 04:28.910
Of an inspiring woman who wears
that shoe in her daily life,

04:28.910 --> 04:33.010
Like a woman who builds houses
for the poor and her work boot,

04:33.010 --> 04:37.660
Or a charitable executive
and her designer heels--

04:37.660 --> 04:40.040
I mean,uh,comfortable stiletto.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.340
Who's really gonna
believe that anyway,right?

04:44.520 --> 04:47.310
What was wrong with the
assignment You were given,betty?

04:47.310 --> 04:48.950
back up.

04:51.270 --> 04:55.570
Nothing. I just thought
that it was a little light

04:55.570 --> 04:57.330
And I could put it in my own voice.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.690
You're not paid for your voice.
You're paid to imitate mine.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.320
I chose that story for you.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.440
Sorry. I just
thought that--

05:04.440 --> 05:08.520
You do make a good point. The
story does need something--

05:08.520 --> 05:10.330
A new writer.

05:10.330 --> 05:13.240
You can go. That's
right,betty. You get nothing.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.510
Everyone,watch betty leave.

05:26.530 --> 05:27.980
That's it?

05:27.980 --> 05:31.010
Your boss was mean to you?

05:31.010 --> 05:33.710
That's your awful week?

05:35.700 --> 05:37.830
Let me finish.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.570
Hilda,I'm freaking out.

05:54.570 --> 05:57.090
I made wilhelmina really,really mad.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.020
What happened? Hey,chew
over the bowl,huh?

06:00.020 --> 06:02.480
She took away my piece. What do I do?

06:02.480 --> 06:05.200
Do go back and apologize
and beg for it back?

06:05.860 --> 06:08.920
tell her I'm coming over,And
I'm pregnant and bloated,

06:08.920 --> 06:11.330
And she'd better do
whatever you tell her to do.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.200
Seeing as that whole
image terrifies me...

06:14.200 --> 06:16.660
I think I'm just gonna ask for it back.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.570
All right,well,that's your call.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.240
Hey,what did I just say?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.280
,ay,I'm going now. And be nice to bobby.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.770
Okay,bye.

06:24.770 --> 06:26.930
My father is mad enough
that you got me pregnant.

06:26.930 --> 06:28.600
You can't afford to wreck his house.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.950
All right. It was an accident.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.280
We can't afford any more
accidents around here.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.240
look,it's a little
spaghetti on an old rug.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.840
- I'll clean it up myself,all right?
- Oh,no,no. I will clean it up,

06:37.840 --> 06:39.550
Because that is who I am around here.

06:39.550 --> 06:41.240
I am the cleaner-upper person.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.090
I cleaned up after justin this morning,

06:43.090 --> 06:44.370
I will clean up after you now,

06:44.370 --> 06:47.200
And I will be cleaning up after
this baby for the next 50 years.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.280
Now you're mad at the baby?

06:48.280 --> 06:50.120
No,I just...

06:51.140 --> 06:52.540
I'm sorry.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.630
I just want to take a
shower,and I haven't had time.

06:55.630 --> 06:59.580
And now I'm pregnant,And I will never
have time to take a shower ever again!

06:59.580 --> 07:01.440
Sweetie,come on,stop.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.960
- What's stopping you from--
- You spilled on the rug!

07:09.030 --> 07:10.580
Excuse me,wilhelmina?

07:10.580 --> 07:12.770
You have 30 seconds. Go.

07:12.770 --> 07:16.360
Okay. Um,I'm sorry,really,really sorry,

07:16.360 --> 07:18.590
About what happened
in the pitch meeting.

07:18.590 --> 07:20.290
I didn't mean to offend you at all.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.280
- 10.
- Wow. That was 20 seconds?

07:22.280 --> 07:24.930
Ally? Is thaw how you want
to use the rest of your time?

07:24.930 --> 07:26.280
No. Right. Again,I'm sorry.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.450
I'm grateful to have the job
at all. I meant no disrespect.

07:28.450 --> 07:31.550
I know my place here,And I will write
a great piece in your voice,I promise.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.020
Save the world on your own time,betty.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.820
You write whatever
fluff piece I give you,

07:36.820 --> 07:40.460
And then maybe I'll give you
something better. Understand?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.870
Yes,100%.

07:44.820 --> 07:47.040
I did like the title of your piece.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.400
"walk a mile in her shoes.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.910
" So let's do that. Let's
have you walk a mile...

07:54.680 --> 07:56.230
In these.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.020
And write about how
comfortable they are.

08:00.020 --> 08:03.310
Oh,and,betty,I know what those soles
look like With a half mile on them,

08:03.310 --> 08:06.400
And I know what they look
like with a whole mile on them.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.810
Oh,my god. Are you
kidding me? Seriously?

08:25.350 --> 08:27.160
- Betty? What the-- are
you all right? - Daniel!

08:27.160 --> 08:28.720
No. I'm gonna die.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.750
Wilhelmina's making me
write a first-person piece

08:30.750 --> 08:32.440
On how comfortable these heels are.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.120
What? Do you want me to talk to her?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.140
No. I'm trying to pay my dues

08:36.140 --> 08:38.059
So she'll give me
something better to write.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.580
Will you walk with me,please?

08:39.580 --> 08:40.990
Okay,but we have to walk fast.

08:40.990 --> 08:44.520
Marc forgot to book my car again. I'm
literally ruging to an appointment at coach.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.450
He's really been
messing up a lot lately.

08:46.450 --> 08:49.530
Marc? Lyally? Marc's
an amazasg assistant.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.420
And no offense,dlniel,But
you're not the best commutocator.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.770
Wait. That's--
bebetty,but-- no. What?

08:55.770 --> 08:59.560
See? I mean,I understood that,But
I've worked withou for a long time.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.750
All right,ue guess maybe. All
right,I gotta go left here.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.800
Okay,just peel off gently.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.060
Oh,no,no! oh.

09:15.290 --> 09:16.650
I can never tell with you,betty.

09:16.650 --> 09:19.160
Is this an accessory you're working,Or
did you actually hurt yourself?

09:19.160 --> 09:21.940
I actually fell into traffic.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.910
A mile and a quarter.

09:29.910 --> 09:31.980
I was ten blocks away from st.Vincent's,

09:31.980 --> 09:34.250
So I just kept going,and fortunately,

09:34.250 --> 09:35.990
It was a long wait,so
I could write my piece.

09:35.990 --> 09:38.420
I e-mailed you 200
words from the hospital.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.920
Fine. You may have anher piece.

09:43.630 --> 09:49.120
Supposed to make your skin feel As
soft as a baby's ass in two days.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.700
See you Thursday.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.660
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.920
was that really moisturizer?

10:01.920 --> 10:04.340
By ukrainian standards,yes.

10:04.340 --> 10:07.280
Oh! Connor put me in the
worst mood this morning.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.750
He's pushing me away.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.130
He thinks he's doing it for me.

10:10.130 --> 10:13.550
He suggests I go out live my life.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.950
What? What are you doing with your face?

10:18.950 --> 10:21.020
You really are in love with him.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.550
Of course,but that's no
reason to feel things for me.

10:24.550 --> 10:27.530
You have to find a way to tell
him that you're not going away.

10:27.530 --> 10:30.670
Actly. But how can I prove
to him that I'm as committed

10:30.670 --> 10:34.230
To this relationship as he
is to that prison sentence?

10:37.710 --> 10:38.910
I think I've got it.

10:38.910 --> 10:41.280
Oh,my god. You're not gonna
break him out of jail,are you?

10:41.280 --> 10:44.800
No. Just the opposite.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.050
Darling,as happy as I am to see you,

11:01.050 --> 11:02.650
Shouldn't you be out
on the town right now

11:02.650 --> 11:05.390
Trading barbs with some
irritating socialite?

11:05.890 --> 11:09.420
you're irritating enough,Especially
when you talk like that.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.590
Now listen to me.

11:10.590 --> 11:13.460
I know you're worried
about me,which is touching.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.480
But I've had enough.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.640
- What the--
- just open it.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.590
We're getting married.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.280
Willie,this is crazy.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.370
I mean,I love you for trying this,

11:34.370 --> 11:36.250
But I'm still locked up in here.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.210
And marriage is my way of showing you

11:38.210 --> 11:40.410
I'm willing to be as
locked up as you are.

11:40.410 --> 11:42.860
Connor,I love you,And
I'm not gonna lose you

11:42.860 --> 11:44.850
just because you're in prison.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.930
- So we're doing
this. - Willie,please--

11:46.930 --> 11:49.120
You can say yes now,or
you can say yes later,

11:49.120 --> 11:53.230
But I will come back every day
until I get the answer I want.

11:53.230 --> 11:54.970
*****

11:56.110 --> 11:59.720
Will... You... Marry me?

12:08.820 --> 12:10.170
Yes.

12:10.170 --> 12:14.570
You pushy,remarkable
woman,I will marry you.

12:19.660 --> 12:24.170
You know,I probably shouldn't say this, But I met
thrfperfect person for that story you wanted to do.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.300
The one about the shoes?

12:25.300 --> 12:27.150
- Don't tell her that.
- Yes,tell me.

12:27.150 --> 12:30.930
Okay,well,you know how my family gives money To
that organization that does reliefk ork in botswana?

12:31.620 --> 12:34.100
Anyway,I met one of the women
that actually does the work--

12:34.100 --> 12:36.350
Very cool,very smart and a grandmother.

12:36.350 --> 12:38.570
She's in town for one more week
before she goes back to africa

12:38.570 --> 12:40.620
For another tour,and she
had on these funky sandals

12:40.620 --> 12:42.230
That would have been
perfect for the shoe angle.

12:42.230 --> 12:44.730
- what did I just say? - What?
She-- she wanted me to tell her.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.250
She doesn't know what she needs.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.900
Now I just want to write it even more.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.420
What is wrong with wilhelmina?

12:49.420 --> 12:52.150
Why can't she see how
good of a piece it can be?

12:52.150 --> 12:54.050
You know what you should do?

12:54.050 --> 12:55.720
Start your own blog.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.550
Yeah! Like that what's her name--
huffington-- Only not so newsy.

12:58.550 --> 13:00.560
Actually,a blog is a great idea.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.740
Then you could write whatever you
want And just publish it yourself.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.700
- Well,yeah,but I don't know how to start a blog.
- I could help you.

13:05.700 --> 13:12.330
Come on. This could be the first step In creating
your own magazine or a book deal... Or a movie!

13:12.330 --> 13:14.770
Okay,I wasn't so sure when you said g,"

13:14.770 --> 13:17.500
But now we're talking movies,so I'm in.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.950
Guys,come on. Would anyone even read it?

13:19.950 --> 13:21.620
There are so many blogs out there.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.640
- Betty.
- Yes.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.000
Really?

13:27.250 --> 13:31.050
Well,I mean,after hand
creams and high heels,

13:31.520 --> 13:33.880
I'd be happy to inspire just one person.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.700
I'm sure I can get in touch with that woman
From the relief mission,set up an interview.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.940
Should I do this? 'cause
I think I want to do it.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.410
- Do it. - Totally.
- yes! - You have to!

13:42.410 --> 13:45.280
Okay! I have a blog!

13:47.170 --> 13:48.600
should this stuff be burning?

13:48.940 --> 13:50.840
Oh,no.

13:55.550 --> 13:59.090
Hey,amanda,Can I use the
apartment later today?

13:59.090 --> 14:00.890
I'm doing this project outside of work,

14:00.890 --> 14:03.280
And I need a place to do
interviews And a photo shoot.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.820
Totally. It's been empty
since we moved out anyway.

14:05.820 --> 14:08.320
Since you what? You moved out?

14:08.320 --> 14:10.550
Oh,my god. Are you serious?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.270
Marc and I moved across
the hall to the 2-bedroom

14:13.270 --> 14:15.180
Because we needed more space.

14:15.180 --> 14:16.930
How many times do I have
to tell you this,betty?

14:16.930 --> 14:18.300
Once would be nice!

14:18.300 --> 14:20.960
Once? Try three times.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.420
hey,betty,it's me.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.070
Listen,marc and I
are moving out,so--

14:24.070 --> 14:27.110
mandy,it's marc.
Betty is 9-1-5-4.

14:28.930 --> 14:32.910
That's hilarious. I
keep doing that. Bye.

14:38.260 --> 14:39.970
Do you know where is daniel meade's?

14:39.970 --> 14:43.620
Hey,betty. Marc and I are moving
out. I told you that,right?

14:43.620 --> 14:45.140
you're sure you told me this?

14:45.140 --> 14:47.170
Yes! Now settle.

14:47.170 --> 14:49.570
It's not like you were
gonna move back in anyway.

14:49.570 --> 14:54.500
Well,no,but I didn't know You'd
be giving up my apartment for good.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.770
Betty,please. You gave up
your apartment a year ago

14:56.770 --> 14:58.540
When you moved back to
your farm or wherever.

14:58.540 --> 15:01.380
This is not a big deal. And we're done.

15:01.380 --> 15:02.750
I'm gonna go hit the ladies'.

15:02.750 --> 15:06.010
Whatever is going on with your skin
makese feel Like I need to go hose off.

15:09.870 --> 15:11.890
Hey. What are you doing right now?

15:11.890 --> 15:13.780
Skydiving. What are you doing?

15:13.780 --> 15:16.980
I'm taking you out for a fun
surprise. Come on,let's go.

15:16.980 --> 15:19.850
Do you not see The woman in
curlers at the end of my arms?

15:19.850 --> 15:21.720
Plus,I-I have another appointment.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.500
You know,figured it out.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.140
You're being mean because
you're almost done raising a kid,

15:26.140 --> 15:27.900
And now you gotta t it agl again.

15:27.900 --> 15:32.950
So as of now,okay,this--

15:32.950 --> 15:34.530
I'm taking you out every day.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.570
We're gonna do something for you

15:36.570 --> 15:39.960
So that you know your life's not just
about Taking care of other people.

15:41.330 --> 15:44.260
Go. Go,or I'm going.

15:46.630 --> 15:49.030
Car's downstairs. You need
to hurry or you'll be late

15:49.030 --> 15:50.620
For your cocktails
with the dsquared guys.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.020
Are you sure the car's here? Because
it never showed at kors yesterday.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.740
Actually,I'm sure the car showed up.

15:54.740 --> 15:57.740
- But it didn't.
- But it did. Now go.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.730
Oh! Stop. Wait. Daniel.

16:00.730 --> 16:01.970
Oh,right.

16:01.970 --> 16:05.520
- Oh! My-- -
my jacket! Shh.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.500
I got this.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.880
- What are you...
- See? Always prepared. Spin.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.220
Where did this jacket come from?

16:14.220 --> 16:15.850
From your dry cleaning.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.730
And it fits flawlessly!

16:19.290 --> 16:21.320
Now get out of here. You
have to be at waverly in ten.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.890
I thought I was going to farmhouse.

16:22.890 --> 16:27.040
Okay,all this doubting me Is
starting to get a little upsetting.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.350
Okay,wow. She's very sensitive.

16:30.350 --> 16:33.540
Hey,I just did my first "she.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.100
" Yeah.

16:40.010 --> 16:41.270
so what do you think?

16:41.270 --> 16:43.170
I love it.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.010
"to inspire at least one person.

16:48.330 --> 16:49.950
Our first interview.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.330
Hey there.

17:00.430 --> 17:01.710
<i>helping***</i>

17:08.490 --> 17:10.240
<i>walk***</i>

17:20.300 --> 17:22.400
- Lee,come in.
- Hi.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.359
*****

17:24.359 --> 17:27.220
I stayed in a gorgeous
hotel on the zambezi--

17:27.609 --> 17:31.130
Amazing views,great food,the works.

17:31.130 --> 17:35.370
And just up the road was
a village of such poverty.

17:35.370 --> 17:37.650
In fact,the hotel solicits donations

17:37.650 --> 17:40.060
To help support the
people who live there.

17:40.060 --> 17:44.160
But after seeing how
these lovely people lived,

17:44.610 --> 17:47.720
I needed to do more
than just write a check.

17:52.390 --> 17:56.860
And if you could see the
smiles on their faces,

17:57.320 --> 18:02.070
The pure gratitude they
feel for so little...

18:02.720 --> 18:04.770
I don't have the words.

18:05.810 --> 18:08.300
So I'll leave that to you.

18:17.020 --> 18:19.140
So what's my surprise?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.710
The surprise is that it's closed.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.970
What happened?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.860
- cut my finger.
- Let me see.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.640
Okay,wait. Let me get a thingy.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.680
Okay. So what am I missing here?

18:36.340 --> 18:40.470
- Concert. Ace of base.
- ace of base!

18:40.470 --> 18:42.330
- Yeah.
- Oh,man.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.370
I remember how much we used
to like 'em in high school.

18:44.370 --> 18:47.140
Love. We loved 'em.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.660
Yeahdoi don't know what's up.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.770
You know,my friend perry Told
me they're playing here Tuesday.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.010
- It's Wednesday.
- Get outta here.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.090
Yeah.

18:56.090 --> 18:57.210
You know,here I am,trying
to make you feel Like

18:57.210 --> 19:00.080
you don't have to take
care of people all the time,

19:00.080 --> 19:01.730
And look at you right now.

19:01.730 --> 19:05.980
Eh. We'll just do something tomorrow.
You did say it's hilda week,right?

19:05.980 --> 19:07.550
- That's right,I did.
- Okay.

19:07.550 --> 19:09.050
Yeah. Let's go.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.870
so did you publish it yet?

19:11.870 --> 19:16.120
No,not yet. I'm scared.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.610
What if no one reads it?

19:17.610 --> 19:19.950
They will,I promise.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.150
Look,do it now while I'm
on the phone with you.

19:24.420 --> 19:26.750
Okay. Ready?

19:26.750 --> 19:28.960
<i>publish***</i>

19:33.310 --> 19:34.620
<i>publishing...</i>

19:34.620 --> 19:36.140
What? What happened? Did it crash?

19:36.140 --> 19:39.060
No. Someone's at the
door. I'll call you back.

19:44.360 --> 19:48.570
The landlord? Mr. Z.

19:48.570 --> 19:52.310
I sent you letters. I call your work.

19:52.310 --> 19:53.740
What are you trying to pull?

19:53.740 --> 19:55.010
What are you talking about?

19:55.010 --> 19:57.940
I want you out of here
by the end of the week.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.770
And if I don't get those
last two months of back rent,

20:00.770 --> 20:03.720
I am going to sue!

20:04.290 --> 20:06.350
What? Two months back rent?

20:06.350 --> 20:08.500
That's right. Two months!

20:08.500 --> 20:11.150
- But-- -
stop. Hold up.

20:11.150 --> 20:13.260
You make me sound like a crazy person,

20:13.260 --> 20:15.320
And you get to be all innocent.

20:15.320 --> 20:19.170
I am innocent! And you were very angry.

20:19.170 --> 20:22.100
Oh,so it's me then? I'm
the worst part of your week?

20:22.100 --> 20:25.190
No. It gets worse.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.970
keep going.

20:39.720 --> 20:42.600
Oh,sweet betty!Don't scare me like that.

20:42.630 --> 20:44.880
Good thing I just took a leak,Or this could have gotten really ugly.

20:44.890 --> 20:49.780
You moved out of my apartment two months ago,And you haven't paid any rent since?

20:53.540 --> 20:55.030
Help. I'm scared.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.680
You should be.Amanda,I can't afford to pay two months of back rent.

20:58.690 --> 21:02.100
Okay,I told you about that.It is not my fault that you're deaf or whatever--

21:02.110 --> 21:04.470
stop talking!You are going to fix this--

21:04.500 --> 21:07.310
Find the money,talk to mr. Z.,do whatever you have to do,

21:07.320 --> 21:09.700
But this is your problem,not mine.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.240
Marc,why didn't you tell me That you moved out of my apartment?

21:22.250 --> 21:24.200
God,who can remember? That was months ago.

21:24.570 --> 21:27.090
A hundred words on wilhelmina's desk by the end of the day.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.100
No! What is that?

21:29.130 --> 21:31.500
Something for the hair... I think.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.970
It's fine,I guess.I'm doing my own thing now,and I'm very proud of it.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.830
Oh! Another hit. I have my own blog.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.270
Aw!Welcome to six years ago.

21:42.410 --> 21:45.780
That was uncalled for. Aw! Welcome to two years ago.

21:45.790 --> 21:46.880
Thank you.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.030
Hey,quitter

21:48.040 --> 21:49.000
Pansy.

21:50.350 --> 21:54.310
I got three hits,and one of them said,you inspired me.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.150
Congratulations. I saw that.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.620
Wait. Was that you?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.510
It was,and actually,that's why I'm here.You have a minute?

22:01.470 --> 22:02.230
Sure.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.890
I'm starving.I'll be back in ten.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.420
But these ladies from neiman's are here to see you.

22:09.540 --> 22:10.490
Really?

22:11.060 --> 22:13.980
so,uh,I thought our meeting was tomorrow,

22:13.990 --> 22:18.820
But clearly it's not because you're here today,Looking so lovely,I might add.

22:18.870 --> 22:22.070
Uh,I think you remember where my office is--Just down the hall to the right.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.290
I'll be there in a jiff.I promise.Thank you so much for coming.

22:25.310 --> 22:26.390
Where the hell is marc?

22:26.400 --> 22:27.630
He just left with willie.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.110
Oh,of course he did.

22:29.570 --> 22:32.100
Ever since we've been sharing him,He's been a total screwup.

22:32.210 --> 22:33.950
You know,he's been getting my appointments wrong.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.480
He forgets my lunch every other day.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.280
He actually sent me to the wrong bar last night.Can you believe that?

22:38.320 --> 22:42.130
And the guys from dsquared Had to come meet me.I looked like a total ass.

22:42.200 --> 22:45.470
Okay,no offense,but this is totally your fault.

22:45.500 --> 22:49.080
Marc's a genius,And you're not the best communicator in the world.

22:49.440 --> 22:54.330
See,I knew what you meant just then,But we've had sex,so it's definitely you.

22:54.420 --> 22:56.560
And willie would kill to have marc back.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.310
Oh,my--that's it. Thittle...

23:02.400 --> 23:04.300
That's exactly what he's doing!

23:04.500 --> 23:07.350
Okay,that right there--I have no idea what you just said.

23:08.060 --> 23:13.000
So guess what? You remember when I said my friend told me Ace of base was playing Tuesday,

23:13.010 --> 23:15.220
And you said,it's Wednesday,dumb-ass?

23:15.230 --> 23:17.830
I don't think I said dumb-ass,but...

23:17.890 --> 23:21.200
well,I was wrong.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.960
They're playing today!

23:23.000 --> 23:24.340
Bobby! Oh!

23:25.440 --> 23:27.090
It might take you a few tries,talercio,

23:27.100 --> 23:30.020
But when you come through,you really come through.

23:30.060 --> 23:34.700
That's right.Plus,we're having ourselves a little sidewalk picnic...

23:34.720 --> 23:39.710
Kelike we used to,except instead of candy bars and beer,We're gonna have actual food.

23:40.630 --> 23:43.230
and prenatal vitamins.

23:43.290 --> 23:46.600
Oh,my god. You think of everything.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.400
****

23:49.820 --> 23:51.100
Hi,honey. What's up?

23:51.590 --> 23:52.870

He's sick.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.000
No. How sick?

24:19.330 --> 24:21.310
Sick enough that I gotta go.

24:21.350 --> 24:24.480
But I want you to stay. This was the best idea.

24:24.510 --> 24:27.760
Unh-unh. I can't stay. Come on.This is-- this is hilda week.

24:27.790 --> 24:32.160
So what? You just have fun and come over tomorrow.You tell me all about it.

24:33.010 --> 24:36.930
So sweet. Thank you.Have a good time. Stay. Have fun.

24:44.070 --> 24:47.790
So after hearing lee's amazing stories about botswana,

24:47.800 --> 24:50.120
I dropped by t mission offices to drop off another check.

24:50.130 --> 24:51.860
Really? I love that.

24:51.890 --> 24:54.000
God,betty,what these people do.

24:54.050 --> 24:57.040
Here,I-I've gotta show you this. Look at this map.

24:57.150 --> 25:02.400
Okay,here is the village,And this is how far away the river is.

25:02.410 --> 25:06.650
Now they have a pump in their village because of us.

25:08.060 --> 25:09.050
What?

25:09.150 --> 25:12.910
Nothing,I just... I've never seen you like this--

25:13.490 --> 25:15.260
So excited and...

25:16.120 --> 25:18.300
I love that you're experiencing this.

25:18.400 --> 25:22.460
Good.Me,too,'cause,uh,that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

25:23.450 --> 25:29.200
I spoke with lee,and she said if I wanted,I could volunteer for the next tour.

25:29.590 --> 25:30.570
For the what?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.960
For--for a tour of what?

25:33.910 --> 25:34.860
Of africa?

25:35.830 --> 25:37.160
Wait. Like,africa africa?

25:37.180 --> 25:41.000
Yeah. Look--look,I know it sounds sudden,But I want to do this.

25:43.650 --> 25:45.450
I want to leave with them next week.

25:57.350 --> 26:00.350
Hello. I'm here to see connor owens.

26:00.420 --> 26:04.680
I'd like a table in the corner Away from everyone else,please.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.940
it's funny how it only takes 20 bucks

26:12.950 --> 26:16.230
And five minutes on the computer to get reordained To marry you and connor,

26:16.240 --> 26:19.440
Yet it's completely illegal for me to marry a man myself.

26:19.470 --> 26:22.720
Are you gonna bring that up every time I get married?

26:22.900 --> 26:24.260
Excuse me. What's his name again?

26:24.270 --> 26:25.700
Connor owens.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.100
It says here he's been transferred.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.830
What? What are you talking about? Transferred where?

26:31.900 --> 26:33.520
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

26:34.090 --> 26:36.150
But he's definitely no longer at this prison.

26:41.580 --> 26:44.650
This is not possible.Connor owens has not been transferred.

26:44.670 --> 26:48.400
You go get him and tell him Wilhelmina slater is here now for him. Go get him!

26:48.410 --> 26:52.550
Ma'am,he's gone.But there is an envelope r wilhelmina slater here.

26:52.580 --> 26:55.420
I don't want an envelope! I want him!

26:55.590 --> 26:58.010
We're supposed to be getting married today,you fool!

26:58.070 --> 27:00.720
Don't you think he would have told me*****

27:00.760 --> 27:03.040
*****Connor! Connor!

27:03.050 --> 27:05.100
You're gonna have to calm her down,or we will.

27:05.110 --> 27:06.930
- Willie,maybe you should--   - no!

27:07.190 --> 27:10.000
Did he do this? Did he make this happen?

27:11.120 --> 27:12.160
He did,didn't he?

27:13.800 --> 27:14.770
Answer me.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.630
Willie...

27:17.200 --> 27:18.760
Don't look at me like that.

27:24.350 --> 27:28.010
Six months? Why do you have to go for a whole six months?

27:28.030 --> 27:31.270
Well,they want you to commit to at least that long So that they know you're serious.

27:31.280 --> 27:36.160
Wait. At least that long?Matt,this is a big move.

27:36.390 --> 27:37.280
Betty...

27:39.060 --> 27:42.640
Look,you said that I needed to find meaning in my life,And you were right.

27:43.660 --> 27:49.000
And I've wasted so mh time asking myself,What do I need?What do I want?

27:49.180 --> 27:54.100
But your story got me to ask a different queion,Like what do other people need?

27:55.020 --> 27:56.830
What is this gonna mean for us?

27:57.500 --> 27:58.960
Would it have to change anything?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.280
How could it not?

28:01.540 --> 28:04.720
Matt,you're gonna be living on the other side of the world For a long time.

28:05.740 --> 28:07.890
And I thought that you would be hpy for me.

28:08.780 --> 28:12.160
Look,I feel like there's some perfect thing I'm supposed to say right now,and,uh...

28:12.670 --> 28:14.830
It's--this is big,and it's sudden,

28:14.860 --> 28:19.130
And... I don't know.I have to wash my hair for wilhelmina.

28:19.170 --> 28:20.960
Look,I-I gotta--I have to go.

28:20.970 --> 28:26.310
Betty,look,You said you wanted to inspire one person,and you did.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.400
Africa? Matt can't survive in africa.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.800
It's crazy,right?

28:38.820 --> 28:43.200
Living in a house made of sticks,Looking for a place to plug in his blow-dryer.

28:43.250 --> 28:46.790
Please. Getting his hair all tall like that--That takes a blowout.I know.

28:46.830 --> 28:50.820
It's just so matt,you know?It's like,one minute he's a lawyer.

28:50.850 --> 28:53.430
The next,he's an artist. The next,he's african.

28:53.510 --> 28:55.320
And I'm just supposed to go along with all of it,

28:55.330 --> 28:57.810
Like I don't mind being another mptemporary thing in his life

28:57.820 --> 28:59.630
That he will euantually move on from?

28:59.660 --> 29:02.400
I mean,he should be considering me in this,right?

29:02.430 --> 29:07.270
Hey,I don't like to get all up in your business,But,l ell yes,he should.

29:07.290 --> 29:09.710
Thank you.But I'm not allowed to say that.

29:09.720 --> 29:13.290
No,because then I sound like a selfish monster Telling the person I love,

29:13.300 --> 29:16.210
no,matt,You can't go to africa to help people.

29:16.230 --> 29:19.520
Hey. You sound however you want.

29:21.950 --> 29:22.910
Who's that?

29:23.470 --> 29:25.200
Papi's supposed to be at work.

29:25.370 --> 29:26.720
ah,they crack me up.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.930
Bobby,what are you doing here? When didou get here?

29:30.950 --> 29:32.320
I got here about five minutes ago.

29:32.330 --> 29:35.880
I brought this one Some of my uncle hugo's special fever soup.

29:35.890 --> 29:37.300
It's guaranteed to work.

29:37.330 --> 29:38.550
It's hideous.

29:38.580 --> 29:42.500
The ingredients are chicken broth,evil and dirt.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.340
Hey,you,just dri it.You'll be up and dancin' by tomorrow morning.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.310
I swear on madonna's cheeks.

29:51.260 --> 29:53.510
Hey,I told you it's hilda week.

29:53.660 --> 29:57.230
Upstairs. Go. Read a book,take a bath,whatever you want.

29:57.730 --> 29:58.830
I got this.

30:01.690 --> 30:03.050
aah! That's it!

30:03.150 --> 30:04.880
Excuse me,wilhelmina.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.930
I'm sorry to barge in,But I would like a second of your time.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.230
I need to ask you to please stop torturing me.

30:10.240 --> 30:16.420
My foot hurts. My armpits hurt.And now my scalp is burning!

30:16.510 --> 30:21.360
All because I wanted to write something That maybe could make the world a little bit better.

30:27.290 --> 30:31.720
So that's it.That's... That's what I wanted to say.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.350
Today was supposed to be my wedding day...

30:36.280 --> 30:37.440
To connor.

30:38.730 --> 30:43.200
But he made himself disappear,With money or connections or I don't... I don't know.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.800
So I can live my life.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.950
I know how to chase people who've wronged me,

30:55.960 --> 30:59.460
But I don't know how to chase people who say they love me...

31:00.380 --> 31:02.110
And then do this.

31:04.870 --> 31:06.760
Well,obviouy he loves you.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.550
That couldn't have been easy for him.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.930
He thinks this is love?

31:18.830 --> 31:20.750
If he loved me,he'd do what I want...

31:25.650 --> 31:27.110
Not this.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.700
Please go.

32:04.910 --> 32:05.920
Thanks for coming.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.420
Of course. I ednted to talk to you,too.

32:08.430 --> 32:10.800
I feel bad about dumping all that on you before.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.610
Yeah,I...Totally freaked out.

32:13.740 --> 32:17.240
Yeah,of course you did.And I've been thinking about it,and maybe you're right.

32:17.860 --> 32:20.700
Maybe,for our sake,I should stay in new york.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.640
Maybe I could do some good here,And maybe I was just getting way--

32:22.650 --> 32:24.200
wait. Whoa,whoa,matt.

32:25.430 --> 32:28.120
Stop.That's a lot of maybes.

32:28.430 --> 32:29.680
I-I didn't mean it that way.

32:29.690 --> 32:33.600
You have to go. You have to do this.

32:35.590 --> 32:36.770
Are you serious?

32:36.850 --> 32:37.930
Very.

32:39.050 --> 32:40.450
You're surout this?

32:43.060 --> 32:44.260
If you are.

32:49.220 --> 32:50.040
I am.

32:52.490 --> 32:55.880
But the one thing you cannot do is doubt how I feel about you.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.720
Betty,you changed my life.

32:59.810 --> 33:04.380
And that lasts forever,No matter where we may stand in the world.

33:07.080 --> 33:11.800
Well...Now I have something to write about...

33:13.920 --> 33:14.950
Good-byes.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.270
Coffee!

33:31.380 --> 33:33.480
Coffee?Marc,I asked you to get my dinner.

33:33.490 --> 33:35.330
Oh,darn it.I knew I forgot something.

33:35.370 --> 33:38.330
Okay,marc,you know what?I understand why you're making all these mistakes.

33:38.410 --> 33:41.800
You want me to fire you so you can go back To working for wilhelmina.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.630
If that's what you want to do,you should just do it.

33:44.880 --> 33:45.700
get on that sca.

33:45.710 --> 33:47.180
Since when do I have a scale in my office?

33:47.190 --> 33:49.650
Since you have me in here.Hop on.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.650
I've lost 8 pounds.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.470
Yes,because I messed up your lunches And forgot to book your cars--

33:58.490 --> 34:02.770
so you'd stop eating Like a lonely girl and actually use those legs a little bit.

34:02.780 --> 34:05.170
And look here-- one,two,three.

34:05.180 --> 34:07.930
That's how many times you were photographed this week.

34:07.940 --> 34:11.290
Let me ask you something--how many times Were you photographed last month?

34:11.770 --> 34:12.469
Once?

34:12.480 --> 34:15.929
Exactly. But this time,you were outside the waverly,

34:15.949 --> 34:20.699
Where there is actually paparazzi,Instead of the farmhouse,where there is not.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.880
And you were in this slimming jacket That looks great in black and white.

34:24.889 --> 34:28.909
And furthermore,Are you aware that you come off a little bit needy?

34:29.600 --> 34:32.590
I d--I do? Really? Do I?

34:32.600 --> 34:36.889
You do,which is why I let the boys from dsquared Go to the wrong bar,

34:36.900 --> 34:40.900
because those queens should go to you.And p.S.,it worked.

34:42.260 --> 34:45.350
Dsquared,michael kors,coach-- they're all back.

34:45.420 --> 34:51.440
So as you can see,in actuality,I did all this for you.

34:51.580 --> 34:52.690
Unbelievable.

34:52.889 --> 34:56.840
I...Hy didn't you just come tell me about all this stuff?

34:57.010 --> 35:01.900
Well,because...When I told you to shave your beard,you refused.

35:03.410 --> 35:07.020
But lucky for me,Now you have to shave it,'cause there's gum in it.

35:07.030 --> 35:08.370
there isn't gum in my beard.

35:08.380 --> 35:10.250
What--what are you...

35:11.200 --> 35:14.950
We can do this your way... Or my way.

35:31.150 --> 35:32.110
Coming.

35:33.390 --> 35:34.320
Coming.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.680
Here. It's not everything,

35:37.700 --> 35:40.100
But I sold some of my hair to make up for the rent money.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.520
But your hair looks the same.

35:41.740 --> 35:45.760
Okay,I sold extensions --used ones.But I still want you to have the cash.

35:48.110 --> 35:50.880
Look,betty,I moved out right after matt chose you over me.

35:50.930 --> 35:55.620
I needed to start over,And I was too rt and mad to talk to you about it.

35:56.030 --> 35:57.190
It was so stupid.

35:58.360 --> 36:01.290
Well...Now we've both lost him.

36:02.350 --> 36:04.010
He's moving away for a while.

36:06.980 --> 36:07.790
Don't smile.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.210
- I'm not.  - You're totally smiling.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.710
so what are you gonna do?

36:16.280 --> 36:18.000
I guess I'm starting over,too.

36:20.610 --> 36:23.650
Well,I heard about an open apartment,

36:23.730 --> 36:27.390
And it's close to me,which I wouldn't totally hate.

36:38.610 --> 36:41.440
it's betty. Can we talk?

36:43.330 --> 36:44.700
Oh,that is a rough week.

36:44.710 --> 36:46.140
I told you.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.940
So what do you say?

36:49.520 --> 36:51.460
Can we figure something out?

36:52.240 --> 36:55.400
Maybe you could raise my rent a little?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.830
I could pay you back over time.

36:57.900 --> 37:02.780
What if I,uh,raise amanda's rent And make her pay me back?

37:02.820 --> 37:05.250
Yeah. That could work.

37:08.230 --> 37:11.780
Did you ever write that piece On,um,good-byes?

37:14.610 --> 37:17.150
Just the first paragraph.Why?

37:17.620 --> 37:20.030
Uh,my old lady left me six months ago.

37:20.860 --> 37:22.450
She said I let myself go.

37:23.690 --> 37:26.400
Point is,I get it.I know what it means to have to...

37:28.860 --> 37:29.930
start over...

37:30.540 --> 37:31.500
And everything.

37:33.270 --> 37:38.300
You read me that paragraph,And I'll let you move back in.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.400
- Really?  - Really.

37:44.380 --> 37:45.690
Sure,I can do that.

37:45.910 --> 37:46.640
You got it there?

37:46.650 --> 37:47.740
Right here.

37:50.630 --> 37:52.390
It's just a rough draft though.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.860
I won't judge.

37:58.790 --> 38:01.860
I've had to say good-bye more times than I would have liked.

38:02.770 --> 38:04.580
But everyone can say that.

38:26.660 --> 38:28.880
and no matter how many times we do it,

38:28.940 --> 38:32.510
even when it's for the greater good,It always stinks.

38:35.590 --> 38:36.640
You think she bought it?

38:39.940 --> 38:41.990
I'll have my guy make the deposit today.

38:42.260 --> 38:44.200
?but less than forget ?

38:44.240 --> 38:45.920
?but spirits born ?

38:45.930 --> 38:48.150
?from the not happened yet ?

38:48.540 --> 38:50.140
?gathering there ?

38:50.370 --> 38:54.600
?to pay off a debt brought back from the wars ?

38:56.570 --> 38:58.870
?we thought we lost you ?

39:00.570 --> 39:02.520
?we thought we lost you ?

39:02.550 --> 39:05.140
and though we'll never forget what we've given up,

39:05.600 --> 39:08.110
We owe it to ourselves to keep moving forward.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.520
E on tomorrow for more hilda time?

39:12.390 --> 39:13.990
Uh,no,I-I don't...

39:14.410 --> 39:16.600
I don't need more hilda time.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.730
You're right. I was--I was freaking out 'cause I thought,

39:19.740 --> 39:24.690
how am I gonna do This whole raising a kid thing by myself all over again?

39:25.020 --> 39:28.830
But now I realize that I don't have to,'cause I have you.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.890
what mas you think I'm gonna stick around?

39:32.340 --> 39:33.640
You.

39:34.360 --> 39:35.870
You make me think it.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.450
I guess I must have done something right.

39:42.360 --> 39:46.420
what we can't do is live our lives always afraid of the next good-bye,

39:47.360 --> 39:50.620
Because chances are they're not going to stop.

40:01.410 --> 40:03.110
I need some inspiration,too,you know.

40:17.720 --> 40:22.660
* I know you want to run far away from one more *

40:22.770 --> 40:25.430
* and that it's comin' at a bad time *

40:25.490 --> 40:29.740
* some cold place heartless ways *

40:30.920 --> 40:33.150
* for all we know *

40:34.170 --> 40:39.350
* I know you need to breathe through come back come too *

40:39.400 --> 40:41.960
* but it's comin'at a bad time *

40:42.010 --> 40:46.120
* somewhat hard tangled day *

41:00.070 --> 41:03.300
the trick is to recognize when a good-bye can be a good thing,

41:04.305 --> 41:10.637
