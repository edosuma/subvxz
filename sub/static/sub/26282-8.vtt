WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.020
-Previously on The Resident...
-What's the average life
expectancy of someone

00:20.054 --> 00:22.056
-NIC: Do you remember
the Barnetts?

00:22.090 --> 00:24.092
-CONRAD: Two adopted kids
with medical needs, right?
-NIC: Yes.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.726
And apparently,
you made quite the impression.

00:25.759 --> 00:26.827
Absence seizures.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.596
He's had them since infancy?

00:28.629 --> 00:31.065
ZOEY: They've always been mild,
and we have them under control.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.733
I've done some reading
on your vagus nerve stimulator.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.235
Is it everything I hear?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.070
It has exceeded
all our expectations.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.906
Why would anyone sell a hip
implant that could leak poison?

00:38.939 --> 00:42.110
This is my industry-- how
do I not know this is going on?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.578
I'm been offered a spot
on a journalism team.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.047
It's at
the San Francisco Chronicle.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.950
*

01:02.963 --> 01:05.099
PRIYA :
I've been waiting

01:05.133 --> 01:08.269
my entire career
for something like this.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.204
Did you hear me?

01:10.238 --> 01:12.773
I can't pass up
this opportunity.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.309
Then take it, babe.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.611
Will you come with me
to San Francisco?

01:17.645 --> 01:20.781
I thought you said that you
were open to me staying here.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.316
You said a lot of couples
are bicoastal.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.118
It's our first year
of marriage, Devon.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.786
We should try and be together.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.789
I can't just...
pick up and leave.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.325
Why not?
I did that for you.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.662
If I walk away, I'll have
to apply for a new residency.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.464
That could take over a year.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.965
What do I do in the meantime?

01:37.998 --> 01:39.300
Silicon Valley is right there.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.635
You could work
on your medical devices.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.304
Mm, hadn't thought of that.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.838
But you're always complaining

01:44.872 --> 01:46.807
about the hospital--
the hours, the pay,

01:46.840 --> 01:49.076
-the paperwork.
-Yeah. I-I complain, sure,

01:49.109 --> 01:51.179
but that doesn't mean
I want to quit.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.646
Priya, I...

01:52.680 --> 01:55.716
I have worked
my whole life for this.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.853
Promise me you'll consider it.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.423
That's all I ask.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.158
* I won't let you in, no *

02:04.192 --> 02:06.160
* I won't let you ground me *

02:06.194 --> 02:09.830
* Don't you ever
call me your friend, love *

02:09.863 --> 02:12.766
-* Don't you ever
call me again, love *

02:12.800 --> 02:14.435
* No reply, no reply *

02:14.468 --> 02:16.837
* So what you've got *

02:16.870 --> 02:18.172
* No excuses *

02:18.206 --> 02:21.008
* There you are *

02:21.041 --> 02:22.176
* Same old you *

02:22.210 --> 02:23.377
* Bet you need a favor *

02:23.411 --> 02:25.613
* Find a girl on your radar *

02:25.646 --> 02:27.681
* I ain't never gonna save ya *

02:27.715 --> 02:29.883
-* Never again *
-* Again *

02:29.917 --> 02:32.186
* Sail on... *

02:32.220 --> 02:34.722
Are you checking my pulse?
You've been doing that

02:34.755 --> 02:36.123
every night since
I got back into town.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.958
And you stop
breathing regularly

02:37.991 --> 02:39.893
-throughout the night.
-Isn't that called
sleep apnea?

02:39.927 --> 02:42.396
You didn't have it before.
I'm checking your pulse

02:42.430 --> 02:44.732
to make sure you
don't have an arrhythmia.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.701
Look... we are never
gonna have a normal life

02:47.735 --> 02:49.870
if you keep overreacting
to every little thing.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.040
I'm taking you in
to see Dr. Austin today.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.876
* Funny how they think
that they know us *

02:55.909 --> 02:58.746
* You ain't laughin',
now there is no us *

02:58.779 --> 03:00.748
* You and I, you and I *

03:00.781 --> 03:03.817
* Take me back around
to the place where *

03:03.851 --> 03:06.587
* You first found me,
I won't let you in, no... *

03:06.620 --> 03:08.389
Hey.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.891
Two ships passing in the night.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.560
Your night. My morning.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.428
I hate when we have
opposite schedules.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.197
I hate waking up
and not having you next to me.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.335
If we were on the same schedule,

03:21.369 --> 03:24.438
you could come with me
to Henry's game.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.940
I don't know who's more excited
about it, me or him.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.943
-My money is on you.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.347
You're getting pretty involved
with this family.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.283
Ah, it's just one game.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.585
* You and I *

03:37.618 --> 03:40.087
Have a good time.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.121
* Oh, oh *

03:41.154 --> 03:43.023
* Oh, oh, oh, yeah *

03:43.056 --> 03:44.792
* Mm, hmm. *

03:44.825 --> 03:47.628
Dr. Bell, you understand this
is a deposition for the case

03:47.661 --> 03:49.763
of The State of Georgia
v. Dr. Lane Hunter?

03:49.797 --> 03:53.200
And may I remind you,
you're under oath.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.204
Dr. Hunter is charged with
poisoning hundreds of patients

03:57.237 --> 03:59.973
with unnecessary chemotherapy,

04:00.007 --> 04:01.775
and raking in
more than $20 million

04:01.809 --> 04:03.277
from fraudulent billings.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.878
She's also under investigation

04:04.912 --> 04:06.880
for the death of Lily Kendall.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.816
So, Dr. Bell...

04:08.849 --> 04:11.352
how long were
you and my client lovers?

04:14.322 --> 04:16.290
*

04:16.324 --> 04:18.392
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:18.426 --> 04:19.393
Nice.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.695
*

04:25.098 --> 04:27.401
Henry! Henry!

04:27.435 --> 04:28.802
* Green lights *

04:28.836 --> 04:32.573
* 90 degrees
with the top down... *

04:32.606 --> 04:34.475
Here we go, here we go.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.910
Low, drive, swing.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.978
Excellent. Yes.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.246
Ball!

04:39.279 --> 04:40.514
Keep your grip snug.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.682
Not too tight. Knuckles.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.683
They should align.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.485
That's it. Yes!

04:44.518 --> 04:46.086
Nice. Okay.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.088
Ball four.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.357
All right, you're up.
You're up, buddy.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.024
Good luck, good luck,
good luck.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.760
All right, here we go.
Here we go, Henry.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.827
Good luck, buddy.

04:55.363 --> 04:58.198
Knock the cover
off that ball, baby!

04:59.700 --> 05:01.369
Wait for the right pitch!

05:01.402 --> 05:03.003
Wait for
the right pitch!

05:04.738 --> 05:05.873
Yeah!

05:08.041 --> 05:10.344
CONRAD:
Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:10.378 --> 05:12.713
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

05:12.746 --> 05:14.715
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.554
UMPIRE:
Every... Everybody take a knee.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.022
Henry?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.525
MAN:
Henry, are you okay?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.394
*

05:28.061 --> 05:30.398
*

05:58.091 --> 06:00.494
Hello, Randolph.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.229
-You had me deposed.
-On the advice

06:02.262 --> 06:04.331
of my court-appointed attorney.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.400
Got you here, didn't it?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.335
Now what?

06:08.368 --> 06:11.939
You betrayed me
to save your own skin.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.274
Look at me.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.077
Look at me, Randolph.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.346
I was the top oncologist
in all of Georgia.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.349
The head of the department
at Chastain. Self-made.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.418
Respected everywhere and rich.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.920
I had everything,
and you did this.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.757
-You did this to me.
-That phone call to the FBI

06:29.790 --> 06:31.258
was one of the most
difficult things

06:31.291 --> 06:33.026
I've ever had to do in my life.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.096
You put me
in an impossible position.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.265
We were an incredible team,

06:38.298 --> 06:40.434
the two of us
at the top of our fields.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.902
Together, we...

06:43.336 --> 06:45.439
-It was you, not me...

06:45.473 --> 06:47.274
who ruined it.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.210
I cared deeply about you.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.481
And whether you
believe it or not...

06:53.514 --> 06:57.150
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.386
Hmm.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.290
Do you think I was born moments
before you walked in here?

07:03.323 --> 07:04.992
I mean, please, Randolph.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.961
The only person you
have ever cared about is you.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.998
-Nice try, though.
-You drew me in here
with a threat.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.900
What's your agenda?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.469
To use your deposition
in a certain video

07:15.503 --> 07:18.138
of the two of us
at the Four Seasons Hotel

07:18.171 --> 07:20.808
to get out of this place.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.810
You're bluffing.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.679
Would you like
the Vimeo passcode?

07:29.683 --> 07:33.320
Once the jury sees
how close we were...

07:33.353 --> 07:35.989
I have a feeling
they're gonna believe me

07:36.023 --> 07:38.692
when I get up on that stand.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.264
When I tell them
that you were my confidant

07:44.297 --> 07:47.167
from the very beginning.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.504
That it was actually you who
told me to destroy those files.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.006
To make sure
that nobody weaponizes

07:53.040 --> 07:56.009
a couple of bad outcomes.

07:56.043 --> 07:59.580
That it was you
who fueled my panic.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.051
You misled me.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.058
You broke my heart.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.200
Tell me, Randy,

08:20.233 --> 08:22.235
am I bluffing?

08:23.336 --> 08:26.039
I want a top-notch attorney,

08:26.073 --> 08:28.642
someone who wears
a fancier suit than you do,

08:28.676 --> 08:30.711
and I get half a million dollars

08:30.744 --> 08:33.080
to make bail so I
can get out of this rat hole.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.414
Don't worry, sweetheart,

08:34.447 --> 08:36.750
I can pay you back
when I get out.

08:36.784 --> 08:40.220
I have a couple
of loaded offshore accounts.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.055
I just can't access them
while I'm in prison.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.724
What do I get in return?

08:43.757 --> 08:46.660
I make sure
to keep you and Chastain

08:46.694 --> 08:49.763
out of this entire case.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.532
*

08:55.936 --> 08:57.571
GORDON:
Ah, good.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.440
I have some very big news
to share with you.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.576
QuoVadis is going public.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.412
-That's terrific.
-Yes. But before the IPO,

09:05.445 --> 09:08.849
we need a successful launch
of the vagus nerve stimulator.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.952
The profit potential
of that device is...

09:11.985 --> 09:13.453
enormous.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.756
It'll be like a pacemaker
for the brain,

09:15.789 --> 09:18.626
treating everything
from depression to epilepsy.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.761
Damn thing even cures hiccups.

09:20.794 --> 09:24.531
I will do whatever it takes
to make the VNS a success.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.634
But, Gordon, can I ask you

09:26.667 --> 09:28.769
-Of course.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.470
I just assisted on a case

09:30.503 --> 09:34.642
with a man whose metal-on-metal
hip implant poisoned him.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.711
It made him blind, almost deaf,

09:37.745 --> 09:39.146
and demented.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.782
Geez. That's horrific.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.551
Uh, the model
must have been defective.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.988
It was. I researched
the company that made the hip.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.891
And they imported
all their devices from China

09:50.924 --> 09:53.894
and pretended
it was made in the U.S.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.463
I discovered...

09:56.496 --> 09:58.699
you worked for that company.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.571
If I understand what
you're saying, uh... it's true.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.107
But I was very young.
I was barely an intern.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.812
Look, I founded QuoVadis

10:11.845 --> 10:15.582
to create the change
that I want to see.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.918
That's why we manufacture
everything ourselves

10:17.951 --> 10:19.653
right here in Atlanta.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.922
We import nothing from China,
so that I can ensure

10:21.955 --> 10:25.125
that we are making products
that patients can trust.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.495
You know, this...

10:28.528 --> 10:30.864
isn't a job to me.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.567
This is my calling.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.538
That's what I needed to hear.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.176
-Thank you.
-DEVON: I'm calling
from Chastain.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.045
Chastain Park Memorial!

10:45.078 --> 10:46.880
IRVING:
Hey, Atlanta General ER
is on diversion.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.182
This is the start of a day
from hell. Move faster.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.719
Look, I've already
been on hold for over an hour.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.121
Patient records at Atlanta
General, poison control.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.223
Yeah, patient in 8 has been
waiting an hour. Figure it out.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.691
CONRAD:
Irving!

10:57.725 --> 10:59.226
IRVING:
Pravesh!

10:59.259 --> 11:01.795
-Henry had a grand mal seizure

11:01.829 --> 11:03.697
on the field--
it's lasted over 20 minutes now.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.232
He has a history
of seizures, right?

11:05.265 --> 11:08.035
Yes. Absence seizures,
but stable on medications.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.369
He's never had a seizure

11:09.402 --> 11:10.904
-like this before.
-On my count.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.040
One, two, three.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.607
Thank you.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.211
Hey. Go.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.546
We got this.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.915
Let go.
All right.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.086
-Thanks for coming in.
-Well, it's rare you call

11:26.119 --> 11:27.554
for a peds neurologist
to the ER,

11:27.587 --> 11:28.856
so I figured it was important.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.592
Well, he's already
on valproic acid at home.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.395
We need to add a third agent,
phenobarbital.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.897
Another medication?

11:36.930 --> 11:39.666
Zoey, I know this is a lot,

11:39.699 --> 11:43.370
but we have to be aggressive
to control these seizures.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.598
This is Julian Booth.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.767
WOMAN:
Hello, I'm calling
from Medicine Tracking Dynamics.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.937
QuoVadis pays us
to monitor prescription drugs

12:16.970 --> 12:18.972
and alert them
of prospective patients.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.274
There's one
at Chastain Park Memorial

12:21.308 --> 12:24.044
that's now receiving
three anti-seizure meds:

12:24.077 --> 12:26.947
fosphenytoin, valproic acid
and phenobarbital.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.316
Which makes him a VNS candidate.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.219
QuoVadis flagged this as
high priority on your account.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.554
I don't have a patient name,

12:34.587 --> 12:37.991
but the order came
from Chastain ER.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.966
Hey.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.168
You look busy.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.871
Always.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.476
Devon, this doesn't
have to be weird.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.379
We are completely capable
of still being friends.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.151
Agreed.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.153
:
So, friend,

13:06.186 --> 13:07.654
what can I do for you?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.656
I got a call about a patient

13:09.689 --> 13:12.692
in the ER who was just put
on several anti-seizure meds.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.995
Henry Barnett.
Status epilepticus.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.930
He's looking rough.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.999
Poor kid.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.768
His brother died here
a month ago.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.871
I didn't know it was a child.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.538
What's this about?

13:25.572 --> 13:28.909
Um... nothing.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.518
Are you telling me
he has cancer?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.353
-No, that's not...
-Five hours in the ER

13:40.387 --> 13:42.022
only to get in here

13:42.055 --> 13:44.357
to have you look at us
like he's going to die.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.893
-Ms. Waverly,
I know that you're concer...

13:45.926 --> 13:47.060
What are you?

13:47.094 --> 13:50.230
A med student?
This man is my whole life,

13:50.263 --> 13:52.199
and you're the one
that's going to save him?

13:52.232 --> 13:55.135
No. I want somebody
that doesn't have that look

13:55.168 --> 13:57.037
on their face.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.239
I'm ordering a CT...

14:02.075 --> 14:04.377
...a CT to see what is going on

14:04.411 --> 14:05.745
so I can hopefully
rule out cancer.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.381
See you in five hours.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.985
It's okay, baby.
Don't worry.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.586
It's okay.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.423
I am enjoying our stroll,

14:16.456 --> 14:18.258
but don't you two
have other things to do?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.593
Are you kidding? I always have
time for my favorite patient.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.330
-We know what today is.
-NIC: And we have

14:23.363 --> 14:25.732
no intention of letting you
face it alone, Wallace.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.435
My wife, Anna,
would've been 36 today.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.237
Remember her last birthday

14:30.270 --> 14:33.240
:
We threw quite a party.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.675
It's hard to believe

14:35.708 --> 14:38.845
my wife spent the last year
of her life at Chastain.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.447
MINA:
I don't think there's
a doctor or nurse

14:40.480 --> 14:41.581
who didn't know her.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.250
A great lady.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.518
Think, uh, both of you--

14:45.552 --> 14:47.187
and the whole staff--

14:47.220 --> 14:49.722
did all you could to save her.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.094
Now I'm the patient.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.863
Another year has gone by,

14:56.896 --> 14:58.865
and now it's my turn
to spend my days here,

14:58.898 --> 15:01.368
waiting for a new heart.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.105
And until we find one,
you're stuck with us, Wallace.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.807
Oh, she means
you're stuck with her.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.944
-I'm delightful.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.880
Hey.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.149
I heard about Henry.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.951
How's he doing?

15:17.985 --> 15:19.386
CONRAD:
Finally broke his seizures.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.154
Now he's reacting negatively
to the medications.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.923
Well, I'm sure Dr. Eckart
has it under control.

15:24.992 --> 15:28.828
He's Henry's doctor now.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.837
I can't step back.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.840
Not after everything I've seen
this family go through.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.909
I know.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.978
But this is why we try

15:45.012 --> 15:47.347
to keep a safe distance
from our patients.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.156
-I should get in there.
-Yeah.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.594
Hey, buddy.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.164
-Yeah.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.499
Is this gonna hurt?

16:06.533 --> 16:09.836
Nah.
You'll feel a little pinch.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.604
That's just
the numbing medication.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.340
After that all you'll feel
is a little bit of pressure.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.147
You're really brave, baby.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.850
Got a question for you.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.185
Who's your favorite
baseball player?

16:25.218 --> 16:27.020
Bryce Harper.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.788
CONRAD:
Washington Nationals.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.523
That is a solid choice.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.859
Tell Dr. Hawkins
why you like Bryce Harper.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.895
-His cleats are awesome.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.532
Your decision's based
on footwear?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.034
He's supercool.

16:41.068 --> 16:45.305
Henry, you are one tough kid.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.040
And I bet your buddy
Bryce Harper

16:47.074 --> 16:49.742
would think
you're supercool, too.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.715
GORDON:
This boy

16:55.748 --> 16:57.884
is perfect for the VNS.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.819
I mean, we're never gonna get
a more sympathetic patient.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.055
Spectacular optics.

17:02.089 --> 17:05.392
So, the VNS is approved for use
in pediatric patients?

17:05.425 --> 17:06.926
I'm sure Gordon
has crossed his T's

17:06.959 --> 17:08.728
and dotted the I's on this one.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.063
Indeed, I have.
We're approved.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.932
But as a 510 device?

17:12.965 --> 17:16.436
I know. She's worried because
with 510 FDA approval,

17:16.469 --> 17:17.770
there's often no testing

17:17.804 --> 17:20.740
before a device gets implanted
in patients,

17:20.773 --> 17:22.809
which is exactly why
QuoVadis does its own research.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.279
Now, we haven't published yet.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.919
But everything is here,
and it's all that any doctor

17:32.952 --> 17:34.587
could possibly ask for.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.589
BELL:
If you meet with any resistance,
just don't hesitate

17:36.623 --> 17:38.791
to let me know. I want to make
sure we're all on the same page.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.440
So, are you done?

17:53.473 --> 17:56.443
Should we be concerned
about Micah's heart rate?

17:56.476 --> 17:58.645
Your boy's gonna be fine.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.812
We just need to adjust

17:59.846 --> 18:01.614
his beta-blockers
and order a sleep study.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.550
You can go ahead and button up.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.753
Mina, can I talk to you outside
about a separate matter?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.897
Listen, don't let
your all-consuming worry

18:17.930 --> 18:20.300
for lover boy
make you lose your focus.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.968
Nothing gets in the way
of my work,

18:22.001 --> 18:24.003
and stop calling him lover boy.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.573
It's becoming annoying.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.642
We got a heart.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.910
Dr. Austin,
you're on Wallace Troke's

18:30.943 --> 18:32.345
transplant team
this week, right?

18:32.379 --> 18:34.314
-Just say yes.
-Yes.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.816
Isn't this the dude
with takotsubo cardiomyopathy?

18:36.849 --> 18:38.818
-Broken heart syndrome.
-MINA: The first case I've seen

18:38.851 --> 18:40.853
where grief literally
broke someone's heart.

18:40.887 --> 18:41.921
NIC:
His wife, Anna,

18:41.954 --> 18:44.524
died here after a long illness.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.327
Every day for a year he walked
three miles just to be with her

18:47.360 --> 18:49.028
and then three miles back home.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.497
Were there no buses running?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.998
He liked to walk.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.200
Said it made him feel
the importance

18:53.233 --> 18:54.501
of his daily commitment

18:54.534 --> 18:57.170
-to be with her.
-Oh, adorable, if nutty.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.872
His only chance of surviving
is this transplant.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.941
The good news is we found
an organ that's a match.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.344
But we need you to harvest it
at Methodist Memorial.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.779
Have you ever assisted
in the harvest

19:06.813 --> 19:08.181
-No.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.183
Is that an invitation

19:10.217 --> 19:11.551
-Do you need it

19:11.584 --> 19:14.287
-I do not.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.922
Then let's get
this ball rolling.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.399
MINA:
Dividing the pulmonary veins

19:26.433 --> 19:28.134
and main P.A.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.570
It is a perfect organ
for Wallace.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.245
And what are we looking for,
Dr. Okafor?

19:38.278 --> 19:42.315
MINA:
Defects and vegetations
on the valves.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.050
And an adequate rim
of atrial tissue

19:44.083 --> 19:45.718
next to the coronary sinus.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.421
I was getting to that.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.590
I know.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.040
MINA:
Charge.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.615
Clear.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.954
AUSTIN :
Ah.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.291
Now, back to Chastain,

20:24.324 --> 20:26.626
where the transplant team
will put this beautiful organ

20:26.659 --> 20:28.461
in our man Wallace.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.932
ECKART:
Henry's LP ruled out
an infection,

20:32.965 --> 20:34.767
and his MRI didn't show
anything concerning.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.868
And that's good news.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.537
Yes, but it still means

20:37.570 --> 20:38.971
we don't know
what's causing his seizures.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.541
Truth is, sometimes
we never know.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.977
Henry's EEG still shows runs
of nonconvulsive seizures.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.114
With their length and frequency,
if this goes on much longer,

20:48.147 --> 20:50.283
he can sustain
permanent brain damage.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.519
Brain damage?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.728
What do you suggest we do now?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.162
If the seizures continue,

21:03.195 --> 21:04.831
we're gonna have to put Henry
into a coma

21:04.864 --> 21:06.333
so that his brain can rest.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.834
Are there any other options?

21:07.867 --> 21:09.869
Actually, there is.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.341
Julian, this is Henry's mom,
Zoey Barnett.

21:14.374 --> 21:18.077
Julian Booth works
with a cutting-edge

21:18.110 --> 21:19.812
new medical device company,
QuoVadis.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.249
I am so sorry
Henry's going though this.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.318
But we may have a solution.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.654
We have a new VNS device
designed for cases

21:27.687 --> 21:29.088
exactly like your son's.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.491
VNS devices are a last resort.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.159
And they've all had

21:33.192 --> 21:35.762
significant side effects,
including sudden death.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.666
This newest version
is thoroughly tested and safe.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.934
This is for Dr. Eckart.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.036
He is the doctor
who makes this call,

21:44.070 --> 21:45.271
along with Henry's mom.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.340
There are trials that show

21:47.374 --> 21:49.275
it can be used much earlier
in epilepsy,

21:49.308 --> 21:52.278
sometimes removing the need
of medications altogether.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.681
If you have access
to an improved VNS

21:54.714 --> 21:56.182
that can be used sooner
in epilepsy,

21:56.215 --> 21:57.784
it's a game-changer.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.020
Henry could lead a life
free of seizures.

22:01.053 --> 22:04.123
If the alternative
is putting Henry in a coma

22:04.156 --> 22:07.026
or keeping him on toxic meds,
isn't this worth the risk?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.395
We don't know that yet.

22:08.428 --> 22:12.198
This is not a decision
I would rush into.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.367
If it were me,

22:14.401 --> 22:16.369
I would have Dr. Eckart
go over all the data,

22:16.403 --> 22:17.604
and then you take it from there.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.741
-Not at all.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.543
I'll get back to you.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.912
Right.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.718
They'll take you up to pre-op
and get you ready

22:31.751 --> 22:34.253
for when your new heart
gets here.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.790
Thank you.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.935
You worried about the surgery?

22:50.136 --> 22:52.505
If I die...

22:52.539 --> 22:54.574
when I'm under...

22:54.607 --> 22:56.776
I'm ready.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.678
I'll get to be with Anna.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.414
Wallace, this is a chance
at a whole new life.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.416
I'm starting to think

23:03.450 --> 23:06.453
that heart might be
better served in somebody else.

23:06.486 --> 23:10.523
Not sure
I want a whole new life.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.159
Not if it still feels
like this one.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.696
Grief is horrible.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.432
Breaks you
into a million pieces, I know.

23:19.466 --> 23:22.635
But I promise you,

23:22.669 --> 23:25.371
it will get easier.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.475
How?

23:28.508 --> 23:32.111
By keeping Anna's memory alive.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.447
If you die,
all that goes with you.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.984
Who's gonna be here to talk
about how special Anna was?

23:38.017 --> 23:41.854
How amazing you were together?

23:43.823 --> 23:46.559
I'll see you in recovery.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.661
Yeah.

23:48.695 --> 23:51.197
And... and thank you.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.569
Thank you
for coming down to consult.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.404
No problem.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.474
Did you lose a little weight
since the last time I saw you?

24:01.508 --> 24:03.910
The day hasn't
started off so great.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.678
Hi.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.580
Finally, a specialist.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.315
We've been waiting two hours,

24:09.348 --> 24:12.752
and this Indian doctor is
the only one who's seen us.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.521
-75-year-old male

24:14.554 --> 24:18.090
with two days
abdominal cramping and vomiting.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.859
CT shows a partial SBO.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.228
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.835
What is this?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.670
-He has a bowel obstruction.
-Partial.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.338
-With a soft abdomen.
-But he has significant

24:32.371 --> 24:34.340
pain and is still vomiting.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.675
He needs to be admitted.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.176
To medicine.
This is not surgical.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.444
Next time,
check with your resident

24:38.477 --> 24:39.679
before you call for a consult.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.180
Do not waste my time again.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.816
Find a pair of scrubs
that fit you.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.198
Could you imagine
loving someone so much

24:59.231 --> 25:01.233
it could literally
break your heart?

25:03.736 --> 25:05.738
No.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.376
What about Micah?

25:10.409 --> 25:12.378
Can he break your heart?

25:12.411 --> 25:14.747
No man can break it.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.587
What have you been through
that makes you so invincible?

25:25.257 --> 25:28.995
It was 2014, and I was finishing
up medical school in Nigeria.

25:29.028 --> 25:33.099
My mother is a surgeon,
working non-stop and

25:33.132 --> 25:35.234
gone for all hours,

25:35.267 --> 25:39.371
so it was my responsibility
to look after my sisters.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.243
One night, after dinner,
I put them to bed

25:44.276 --> 25:47.446
and... and decided
to take a quick nap.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.617
A quick nap turned
into a deep sleep.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.085
And when I woke up,

25:53.119 --> 25:55.121
the whole house was on fire.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.759
Immediately, I knew...

25:59.792 --> 26:01.794
I had left the stove on.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.365
I tried to save Kadara
and Ngozi, but...

26:06.398 --> 26:08.400
I couldn't.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.305
They were 12 and 11.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.381
Wow. I'm... sorry.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.917
I loved my sisters very much.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.889
The grief and...

26:29.922 --> 26:32.158
guilt consumed me.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.932
Emotions can enrich our lives,
but they can also destroy us.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.871
Now, I never want
to talk about it ever again.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.517
(alarms sounding,
rhythmic whooshing)

27:09.061 --> 27:11.698
It's been an hour. I think
it's time you called it.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.678
Time of death, 12:03.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.515
I'll speak to the family.

27:29.548 --> 27:31.583
Take a break.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.033
SHELBY:
My husband is still
in severe pain!

27:47.066 --> 27:48.968
Where are we at
with his treatment?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.838
Can you just do the right thing
and come check on him?!

27:53.940 --> 27:57.209
Hello.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.545
-Okay. Okay.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.580
All right.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.052
We'll up his pain meds and...

28:06.085 --> 28:07.720
If you just, um,
give me a minute.

28:07.754 --> 28:10.089
Excuse me?

28:10.122 --> 28:12.591
I have a 75-year-old man
with a small bowel obstruction,

28:12.624 --> 28:14.894
ER Bay Three.
We need to admit him.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.763
Absolutely not. Call surgery.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.931
I did. They won't admit.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.733
Neither will I.
I'm not taking an SBO.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.770
If he gets better, he goes home.
If he gets worse, they operate.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.738
I'm not going
to admit him just to baby-sit.

28:27.639 --> 28:30.777
-We need a doctor over here!

28:30.810 --> 28:33.245
Paramedics found him
on the freeway

28:33.279 --> 28:34.580
with a meth pipe in hand.

28:34.613 --> 28:36.082
Let's get him ten
of IM haloperidol

28:36.115 --> 28:37.449
and check his blood sugar.

28:42.454 --> 28:43.956
Eye station, now!

28:43.990 --> 28:47.259
What happened to your break?!

28:47.293 --> 28:49.796
-All right,
let's get him to Bay Nine.
-Okay.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.608
Is he all right?

29:02.641 --> 29:05.477
His seizures are getting
harder to control.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.814
And the medications
we're giving him are starting

29:07.847 --> 29:09.782
to affect his liver function.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.151
So what do I do now?

29:13.685 --> 29:15.287
I know you're scared, Zoey,

29:15.321 --> 29:17.623
but, just-just give this
a little bit more time.

29:17.656 --> 29:18.958
That's not an option.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.293
Zoey needs to make her decision.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.295
Soon.

29:23.329 --> 29:27.299
Dr. Randolph Bell,
chief of surgery and the CEO

29:27.333 --> 29:31.137
of Chastain has heard
about Henry's case, would like

29:31.170 --> 29:34.340
to talk to you
about the VNS device.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.978
As we've discussed, the VNS

29:39.011 --> 29:41.413
is the best option
available to your son.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.316
ECKART:
Well, I've looked carefully
at the data, and

29:44.350 --> 29:47.353
-the results aren't clear.
-Doctors aren't trained

29:47.386 --> 29:49.588
to consistently evaluate
this type of dense research.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.824
The man can read.

29:51.858 --> 29:55.327
And what he read said
the sample size is dismal.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.930
But the device
has been approved, right?

29:57.964 --> 29:59.498
It has... by the FDA.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.500
So then why
is everyone so nervous?

30:01.533 --> 30:03.335
-Everyone isn't.
-I am.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.037
A high percentage of devices

30:05.071 --> 30:06.839
are recalled after
they've been put in patients

30:06.873 --> 30:09.876
-and have caused
permanent damage.
-That has happened

30:09.909 --> 30:13.112
with other companies,
but not QuoVadis.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.680
BELL:
I wish there were more options

30:14.713 --> 30:16.382
with less risk.
There are not.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.520
You've already lost a son,

30:21.553 --> 30:23.789
and I want to do
everything possible to ensure

30:23.822 --> 30:25.791
that doesn't happen again.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.526
I strongly recommend you do not

30:27.559 --> 30:30.129
go down this path with the VNS.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.398
Ultimately, this is your call.

30:32.431 --> 30:36.202
But I will tell you,
if this... were my child,

30:36.235 --> 30:39.738
I would move forward
and implant the VNS.

30:47.079 --> 30:50.382
Dr. Chao has done
several of these surgeries.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.551
He's highly-experienced
with the VNS.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.887
Has he implanted it in a child?

30:54.921 --> 30:56.822
I want this to go perfectly.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.059
I-I feel responsible.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.661
And if the data
isn't really there...

31:02.694 --> 31:04.897
You really think Gordon Page
would manufacture products

31:04.931 --> 31:07.199
that aren't safe?

31:13.940 --> 31:17.076
Hmm. Well done, Dr. Bell.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.445
This is an historic day.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.780
The first of many, I'm sure.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.271
Whoa. Hold up.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.639
The front
of the heart stopped moving.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.876
It's acute hypokinesis
of the anterior wall.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.612
There's a block
in the middle of the LAD.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.447
The heart is having
a heart attack.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.483
Yo, let's go!

32:03.522 --> 32:05.124
Is Wallace ready for surgery?

32:05.157 --> 32:06.625
Yes, in OR Two

32:06.658 --> 32:08.394
-under general anesthesia.
-Good.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.496
He'll die if we put him back
on the waiting list.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.965
This heart may not be perfect,
but once we fix it,

32:12.999 --> 32:15.301
it'll be his best shot. I need
to get his saphenous vein.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.969
Should we use his LIMA?

32:17.003 --> 32:18.904
It'll take 20 minutes
to open his chest.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.839
You can get a saphenous vein
in five.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.641
Time is heart.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.411
Get me a vein retrieval kit

32:25.444 --> 32:27.980
and start prepping
the left lower leg for

32:28.014 --> 32:30.016
saphenous vein harvest.

32:35.054 --> 32:38.257
AUSTIN:
Octopus clamp.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.327
I thought you'd be quicker.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.329
MINA:
Please. That was a world record.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.832
I've never done bypass on
a beating heart. Can I assist?

32:46.865 --> 32:48.834
Oh, now was that
ever a question?

32:48.867 --> 32:50.436
Hand Dr. Okafor the pickups.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.338
Spatulate the end
of the saphenous vein,

32:52.371 --> 32:55.207
and I will do the arteriotomy.
#11 blade to me.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.555
MINA:
7-0 Prolene.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.695
AUSTIN:
Be careful with your bites--

33:16.728 --> 33:19.165
keep them evenly spaced out.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.475
A little quicker.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.709
I am suturing the aorta.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.044
This is delicate work.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.045
The heart is losing oxygen.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.313
It could not care less.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.816
Done.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.218
Mm. Ah.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.219
There's a small leak.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.055
MINA:
Mm. I see it.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.756
Adding another stitch.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.728
There.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.233
You fixed it.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.435
We fixed it.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.646
AUSTIN:
Shall we give Wallace
the gift of a new life?

34:09.948 --> 34:12.884
* Ooh... *

34:13.885 --> 34:16.422
* Ooh... *

34:16.455 --> 34:19.858
* No, I can't hide it *

34:19.891 --> 34:23.095
* You're ultraviolet *

34:23.129 --> 34:25.897
* Ooh... *

34:26.898 --> 34:30.035
* Ooh... *

34:30.068 --> 34:33.472
* No, I can't hide it *

34:35.641 --> 34:37.476
* You're reading all *

34:37.509 --> 34:39.778
* Of me, you're reading... *

34:39.811 --> 34:42.781
Everything went perfectly.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.117
How long until we know
if this works?

34:45.151 --> 34:46.985
His seizures already stopped.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.288
* Hide it *

34:49.321 --> 34:50.889
Thank you.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.558
Of course.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.295
-* You're ultraviolet *
-Thank you.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.130
* Ah *

34:58.164 --> 35:00.599
* Ooh *

35:01.667 --> 35:03.001
* Ooh *

35:03.034 --> 35:04.636
* Ah *

35:04.670 --> 35:05.804
* You're ultraviolet... *

35:05.837 --> 35:07.639
GORDON:
Well done, Dr. Bell.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.642
Today was a good day,

35:10.676 --> 35:13.345
both for Chastain and QuoVadis.

35:14.346 --> 35:17.149
To a wonderful partnership.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.519
* No, I can't hide it *

35:20.552 --> 35:24.256
* You're ultraviolet. *

35:36.202 --> 35:38.337
I hear it worked.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.705
Nice save.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.173
Yeah.

35:41.207 --> 35:44.042
Great learning opportunity
for Dr. Okafor.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.111
It's not often
you get to operate

35:46.144 --> 35:48.347
on a heart in a box.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.316
Hmm.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.120
Does she know
you're in love with her?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.888
I beg your pardon?

35:58.724 --> 36:01.893
I'm her teacher, her mentor.

36:01.927 --> 36:05.364
To be anything else would cross
a line that I would never cross.

36:05.397 --> 36:08.334
-That must be hard on you.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.637
I deal.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.205
And life is long.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.874
Eventually, one day,
I will not be her mentor,

36:15.907 --> 36:17.909
and she'll be my equal.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.079
For a guy who doesn't wear
his heart on his sleeve,

36:21.112 --> 36:22.448
that was an impressive share.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.084
Let's just keep this between us,

36:30.088 --> 36:32.458
*

36:46.272 --> 36:47.239
:
Hey.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.775
You're on in 20.

36:52.143 --> 36:55.146
Ships passing.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.183
Henry's in recovery,

36:58.216 --> 37:00.452
if you want to check in on him.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.657
Thank you for the update, but...

37:09.127 --> 37:12.631
...I think it's best if
I just let his mom be with him.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.811
Rough day?

37:26.812 --> 37:29.114
Not really.

37:29.147 --> 37:32.217
A touch of racism
from a paranoid wife.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.620
Got physically attacked
by a psychotic meth head.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.055
And what am I forgetting? Um...

37:37.088 --> 37:40.992
Right. Priya told me we have
to move to San Francisco.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.602
Your turn.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.675
I have always been sure
about my field.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.910
But now...

37:58.944 --> 38:02.080
I wonder
if I'm making a difference

38:02.113 --> 38:04.650
or if I'm adding

38:04.683 --> 38:07.252
to a very big problem.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.856
You are smart, Julian.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.091
And passionate.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.926
And honest.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.830
The device industry needs people
like you to fix a broken system.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.332
If you see something
that's not right,

38:20.366 --> 38:24.202
you will be there
to blow the whistle and fix it.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.273
Could the same be said
about you?

38:28.306 --> 38:30.108
There aren't many people
like you, Devon.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.344
Hardly any, in fact.

38:32.378 --> 38:35.213
You were meant to be a doctor.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.067
-Randolph Bell.
-FEMALE VOICE:
You have a collect call

38:56.101 --> 38:57.703
from Atlanta
Correctional Facility.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.238
Inmate 08790, Lane Hunter.

39:00.271 --> 39:01.407
Will you accept?

39:01.440 --> 39:03.308
-Yes.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.644
So, have you got
an answer for me?

39:05.677 --> 39:08.213
If it's not the one I want
to hear, that video of us

39:08.246 --> 39:10.582
gets released tomorrow.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.885
I've, um,

39:13.919 --> 39:16.254
narrowed the list of attorneys
down to three.

39:16.287 --> 39:17.589
Heavy hitters?

39:17.623 --> 39:19.224
Yes.

39:19.257 --> 39:21.560
-That juries

39:21.593 --> 39:24.896
trust doctors and it's possible
we will get off.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.232
And if you do,
it'll help me undo the damage

39:27.265 --> 39:29.401
you did to this hospital.

39:29.435 --> 39:33.338
-Oh, so you're making this
all about Chastain, huh?
-Now, I suggest we

39:33.371 --> 39:37.108
play on the same team from now
on, or at least pretend to.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.278
When do I get to breathe
fresh air again?

39:41.279 --> 39:43.348
Soon.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.984
Very soon.

40:04.736 --> 40:08.206
Hi, I'm one of the sales reps
for QuoVadis.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.608
I know we don't normally
come down

40:09.641 --> 40:11.109
to where we actually build
the devices,

40:11.142 --> 40:13.278
but I need to double-check
on an order

40:13.311 --> 40:14.946
for, uh, Chastain Park.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.381
Could you help me?

40:16.414 --> 40:17.783
I will be so quick.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.184
I promise.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.890
You've got five minutes.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.692
Thank you.
That's all I need.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.159
We manufacture everything
ourselves,

41:01.192 --> 41:02.828
right here, in Atlanta.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.864
We import nothing from China.

41:07.899 --> 41:11.670
This isn't a job to me.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.539
This is my calling.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.318
Oh, my God.

41:40.498 --> 41:44.335
The question should be
what didn't happen to me.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.472
I have had

41:47.505 --> 41:49.808
some pretty terrible days

41:49.841 --> 41:51.577
as a doctor, but today

41:51.610 --> 41:54.880
just might take the prize.

41:54.913 --> 41:58.717
That looks really swollen.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.686
Are you sure you're okay?

42:03.922 --> 42:07.225
Today, I got kicked around.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.260
Abused.

42:09.294 --> 42:11.196
Unappreciated.

42:13.932 --> 42:17.068
At times, I just felt
completely useless.

42:17.102 --> 42:20.471
Then come with me
to San Francisco.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.747
It's not easy.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.415
If it were,

42:30.448 --> 42:32.417
everyone would be a doctor,

42:32.450 --> 42:36.187
because it is the best job
in the world.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.423
Despite everything.

42:38.456 --> 42:42.293
Because of everything.

42:42.327 --> 42:46.264
I wouldn't trade my worst day
at Chastain for my best

42:46.297 --> 42:49.500
making medical devices
in Silicon Valley.

42:57.843 --> 43:00.812
I can't leave.

43:01.813 --> 43:04.249
I'm sorry.

43:09.988 --> 43:13.625
But, hey, hey...

43:13.659 --> 43:15.326
...this doesn't mean

43:15.360 --> 43:18.163
that I don't want to figure out
how to make this work.

43:20.666 --> 43:23.334
But is it really what you want?

44:11.049 --> 44:13.051
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.053 --> 44:16.822
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.390
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.194
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.866
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:27.899 --> 44:31.469
-* We're breaking waves
shooting stars *

44:31.502 --> 44:35.040
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:35.073 --> 44:36.074
MAN: Touchdown!

44:36.107 --> 44:39.677
* Reach out *

44:39.711 --> 44:43.314
* Make this right here
right now *

44:43.348 --> 44:46.251
* Stand up *

44:47.118 --> 44:48.887
* Here right now *

44:48.920 --> 44:50.088
That sounds like fun.
