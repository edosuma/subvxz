WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:02.374
- You planned this?
- Yes.

00:02.884 --> 00:05.250
So we'd get caught! - Comes down
to choosing between your friends

00:05.284 --> 00:07.511
and your brothers.
You have to choose your brothers.

00:07.545 --> 00:08.807
You made your choice pretty clear.

00:08.836 --> 00:09.803
What are you doing here?

00:09.833 --> 00:11.464
Rain check. Remember?

00:11.498 --> 00:13.294
<i>We'd like to congratulate</i>

00:13.329 --> 00:16.056
<i>Russell Cartwright on being this year's
grand recipient.</i>

00:16.090 --> 00:18.157
There's a reason it didn't
work out with Fisher.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.355
- He cheated on me again.
- What?

00:20.389 --> 00:22.887
Mmm. Jasmine. - Someone gave
us a zero out of a hundred?

00:22.921 --> 00:24.156
Yeah. This one judge, Ryan.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.292
He also gave the Gamma Psi's a 100.

00:26.326 --> 00:27.726
That's so shady.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.594
We determined the fire
was started accidentally

00:29.629 --> 00:31.194
by a candle. Jasmine, I believe.

00:31.228 --> 00:32.323
Ah.

00:34.123 --> 00:37.056
You know you're e in fos nine pages.

00:37.091 --> 00:39.557
You know you're in for a hard class
when you sign up to be an engineer,

00:39.591 --> 00:42.890
so get it together,
Gary Wyatt Grant winner.

00:42.924 --> 00:45.024
Hey, you want to go grab
some coffee before lab?

00:45.058 --> 00:48.458
Uh, no can do.
My hot cocoa money's going

00:48.492 --> 00:51.426
directly into the piggy bank

00:51.460 --> 00:53.160
so I can fund my project research.

00:53.194 --> 00:56.995
We don't all have forty grand
burning a hole in our pockets.

00:57.029 --> 01:01.631
Hey, is your fly open or something?
Everybody keeps staring at you.

01:03.033 --> 01:05.399
- This is a new shirt.
- Rusty?

01:05.434 --> 01:08.335
It's Dana? From Space Plasma Physics?

01:08.369 --> 01:10.902
- We met at orientation?
- Freshman orientation?

01:10.936 --> 01:13.169
I had the shirt with
the butterflies on it.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.004
- Why am I talking to you?
- I have no idea.

01:15.038 --> 01:17.972
Oh! To congratulate you.
On winning the Gary Wyatt Grant.

01:18.006 --> 01:19.806
It's... wow.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.708
Well, I have to get to
the science lab, so...

01:22.742 --> 01:24.509
I wonder if they're
gonna have snacks today.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.845
Do you think this is all
because of the grant?

01:27.879 --> 01:29.847
You know what they say:
Mo' money, mo' problems.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.748
So which one of these
hotties are you gonna hit?

01:31.782 --> 01:32.983
Why didn't you get Dana's digits?

01:33.017 --> 01:35.213
I don't know. She seemed
kinda odd, didn't she?

01:35.248 --> 01:37.614
Oh, don't get too picky, Rus.
I got a feeling

01:37.648 --> 01:41.182
those sorority row brainiacs you
consort with aren't gonna have the same
reaction.

01:41.217 --> 01:43.083
OK, very funny. -

01:47.120 --> 01:50.187
- Casey.
- Hi, um, Katherine.

01:50.222 --> 01:53.388
H-how are you? Did you have
fun at the Fairy Tale Ball?

01:53.422 --> 01:55.323
Oh, it wasine. You know
how I feel about parties.

01:55.358 --> 01:57.325
Right. I kw how you feel about those.

01:57.359 --> 01:58.692
But how do you feel about today?

01:58.727 --> 02:01.761
IFC/Panhellenic meeting,
first one. Big day.

02:01.795 --> 02:03.329
It could be a very big day for you.

02:03.363 --> 02:05.763
Really? Like how big of a day?

02:05.797 --> 02:07.164
I think you know what I'm getting at,

02:07.198 --> 02:08.764
so I'm not gonna keep
it from you any longer.

02:08.799 --> 02:10.265
Yeah, I know.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.568
The Vice President of Judicial
position is still open.

02:12.602 --> 02:15.470
I know you turned it down last
semester, but I thought I was gonna
give it another ask.

02:15.504 --> 02:18.004
You've been so supportive
with the Gamma Psi fire

02:18.039 --> 02:19.739
and so patient with
the SongFest judging,

02:19.773 --> 02:23.074
I thought I could trust you
of all people to help me.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.976
- As your VPJ?
- Without delay.

02:27.411 --> 02:29.612
Did you see that? I'm so excited
to have you in the position,

02:29.646 --> 02:30.712
I'm resorting to silly rhymes.

02:30.746 --> 02:32.880
- Ha...
- So are you in?

02:32.914 --> 02:35.949
Of course. - Great,
I already have your first task.

02:35.984 --> 02:39.352
I need you to look into the events
surrounding the Gamma Psi fire.

02:39.387 --> 02:42.321
Really? I thought the police
said it was just an accident.

02:42.356 --> 02:45.291
And I told them that I blew out that
candle, but they're not taking me
seriously.

02:45.325 --> 02:48.893
Something fishy went on that night and
it's driving me crazy not knowing what
it is.

02:48.928 --> 02:52.063
Oh... - I am sure you can
find out what happened, Casey.

02:52.097 --> 02:56.098
Of course, Katherine, I will...

02:56.133 --> 02:58.867
...get to the bottom of this mystery.

02:58.901 --> 03:00.935
- One more thing...
- Yeah?

03:01.704 --> 03:03.905
My own clipboard?

03:03.939 --> 03:08.309
Oh, my... - Commencing,
people, let's start.

03:09.912 --> 03:13.615
Old business: the tutoring
program was a roaring success.

03:13.649 --> 03:16.751
We received rave reviews from
all local teachers. Moving on...

03:18.000 --> 03:24.074

03:26.890 --> 03:28.323
[i[indistinct chat

03:42.266 --> 03:46.100
- So... big class.
- Yeah.

03:46.135 --> 03:48.435
My sorority calls it
"Marketing for Dummies"

03:48.470 --> 03:52.606
because Professor Clarissa's so
desperate to be cool, she gives
everyone A's.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.407
- -
- Awesome, right?

03:54.441 --> 03:58.177
I myself could use an easy A.
Got a pretty heavy load this semester,

03:58.211 --> 04:01.146
since I won the Gary Wyatt
Innovation in Engineering Grant.

04:01.181 --> 04:04.650
I'm gonna be pretty busy
doing extra research.

04:04.684 --> 04:08.553
Well, I won't keep you.

04:08.588 --> 04:11.389
Oh, I see my friend!

04:16.995 --> 04:18.664
Baby Brother Cartwright!

04:18.697 --> 04:20.298
You're taking Marketing for Dummies?

04:22.902 --> 04:26.200
- You seem crabby.
- I just got shot down by a girl.

04:26.235 --> 04:30.170
- I talked about science.
- Oh, no. Which one?

04:30.204 --> 04:32.039
That one. The blonde.

04:32.073 --> 04:35.776
Erika Miller? She is hot.

04:35.810 --> 04:37.677
So one girl thought you were a geek.

04:37.712 --> 04:40.513
One of the guys who asked me out
last week thought I was a sophomore.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.847
Can you believe that?

04:41.882 --> 04:44.316
Yeah, that's not quite
the same situation.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.818
Stupid laptop!

04:46.853 --> 04:48.920
I think I got a virus
downloading a picture

04:48.954 --> 04:51.088
of what was supposed to
be Robert Pattinson naked,

04:51.122 --> 04:52.989
but was a cat playing the piano.

04:53.024 --> 04:55.158
Let me take a look at it.

04:55.193 --> 04:58.528
Might as well put my
nerdiness to some use, right?

04:58.562 --> 05:03.031
I haven't had a date since,
uh... - Jordan? Right?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.235
Well, I took my cheating boyfriend back

05:07.269 --> 05:10.303
and got cheated on again, so...

05:10.338 --> 05:12.005
I'm sorry, Ash.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.514
Just trying to get your attention!

05:23.548 --> 05:25.081
Can I get a what-what?

05:29.652 --> 05:32.787
No? OK!

05:32.822 --> 05:37.359
Marketing Rule Number One:
Know your target audience.

05:43.199 --> 05:46.101
Case! Case, come on, where's the fire?

05:46.135 --> 05:48.236
I don't think it's a good
idea that we talk, Evan.

05:48.270 --> 05:50.838
What, Cappie hates me,
so you have to hate me too?

05:50.872 --> 05:54.641
No, I... I'm mad at you
because I'm mad at you!

05:54.675 --> 05:57.043
What? And you won't give
me a way to apologize?

05:57.077 --> 05:59.078
There's nothing you can say!
We were all friends again.

05:59.112 --> 06:00.479
Why'd you have to screw it up?

06:00.513 --> 06:03.048
You screwed it up! By getting
back together with Cappie

06:03.082 --> 06:07.718
and expecting me to be third wheel in
your fantasy re-creation of freshman
year.

06:07.753 --> 06:09.520
Look!

06:09.554 --> 06:12.656
Case, you know how important it
was to me to win my house back.

06:13.758 --> 06:14.992
Way to rationalize.

06:20.230 --> 06:23.899
See? In honor of Fisher.
It's called Burnt Betrayal.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.568
Burnt? Did they find out?
Are we screwed?

06:26.603 --> 06:29.438
- No, Betsy. You're safe.
- OK.

06:31.241 --> 06:33.609
Everyone is still really
on edge about the fire.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.477
-

06:35.511 --> 06:37.045
Sorry!

06:37.079 --> 06:38.913
- -
- What fire?

06:38.948 --> 06:42.217
The Gamma Psi fire.

06:42.251 --> 06:43.885
The one that your candle started.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.222
Come on, you're not worried
we're gonna get in trouble?

06:47.256 --> 06:50.492
The only worry I have right now is
having to wake up at seven tomorrow

06:50.526 --> 06:53.161
to try to add another class.
I hate waiting in lines.

06:53.196 --> 06:55.130
It's so Midwest. -

06:55.164 --> 06:58.634
Heather and Reagan nearly came
to blows over a parking space.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.135
I think the girls are still nervous.

07:00.169 --> 07:04.005
Affirmative. So, how was the meeting?
Was Katherine weird?

07:04.039 --> 07:05.106
You know, more than usual?

07:05.140 --> 07:06.774
Is it weird she gave me

07:06.808 --> 07:09.510
the VP of Judicial
position and my first task

07:09.544 --> 07:11.344
is to investigate the Gamma Psi fire?

07:11.379 --> 07:12.979
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

07:13.013 --> 07:15.348
No more fire talk for me, thanks.
I'm gonna watch TV.

07:16.483 --> 07:17.650
Huh.

07:19.953 --> 07:22.522
Complete and utter denial.
It's almost pathological.

07:22.556 --> 07:23.690
It's Rebecca.

07:23.725 --> 07:25.626
You know,

07:25.660 --> 07:27.395
if you're in charge
of the investigation,

07:27.430 --> 07:29.932
you could always investigate
it away from us.

07:29.966 --> 07:32.668
And abuse my authority and
continue to lie to Katherine,

07:32.702 --> 07:34.870
which is killing me inside?
I can't stand the guilt anymore!

07:34.904 --> 07:37.439
OK? - Yeah. All the
sisters are on edge, too.

07:37.473 --> 07:39.908
We need to give them
something else to focus on.

07:39.942 --> 07:42.645
Maybe, uh, philanthropy? For Gamma Psi!

07:42.679 --> 07:44.147
Maybe that could help
us all feel better.

07:44.181 --> 07:47.049
Maybe trot out the old
bachelor auction fundraiser.

07:47.084 --> 07:49.919
i>- The cops are here!
It's just General Hospital.

07:49.953 --> 07:51.387
Turn it off!

07:52.889 --> 07:55.524
Um, yeah, the philanthropy
is a good idea.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.626
You take care of that.
I'm gonna start my

07:57.661 --> 08:00.329
big fake investigation.

08:00.363 --> 08:04.366
Over the holidays, Brother Barry
and I were fortunate enough

08:04.401 --> 08:07.703
to attend a secret conference. In Akron.

08:07.738 --> 08:10.573
Birthplace of the United
States trucking industry.

08:10.607 --> 08:13.308
I can't say more. Anyone
else do anything interesting?

08:13.343 --> 08:16.411
I traveled to South
America with my family

08:16.446 --> 08:20.181
and assisted in a ritual sacrifice.

08:22.819 --> 08:26.357
You know who didn't assist
people over break? Evan.

08:26.391 --> 08:28.893
- Drop it, Cappie.
- Why? Don't you stand by your actions?

08:28.927 --> 08:32.162
Or are you embarrassed to have these
people find out what an ass-clown you
really are?

08:32.197 --> 08:35.198
Look, I'm not gonna apologize for
doing what I had to do for my house.

08:35.232 --> 08:38.235
You'd do the same if... - My house
would never ask me to screw with
people's lives,

08:38.269 --> 08:40.736
because we're not a bunch of whiney,
spoiled brats!

08:40.770 --> 08:43.273
No, you're just a bunch of losers
who will still be living there

08:43.307 --> 08:45.308
while the rest of us,
including your girlfriend,

08:45.343 --> 08:47.076
have real lives.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.511
- -
- The sacred urn!

08:48.546 --> 08:50.180
Don't let it touch the ground!

08:50.214 --> 08:52.649
Oh, my gosh! -

08:55.586 --> 08:59.188
- -
- Not the sacred robe, Jenna!

08:59.222 --> 09:03.192
Amphora does not tolerate personal
conflict to the detriment of the group.

09:03.227 --> 09:05.695
Brother Brett, is there a
procedure to remove an Amphora

09:05.729 --> 09:07.596
who has betrayed another Amphora?

09:07.630 --> 09:10.366
Or to remove one who never deserved
to be here in the first place?

09:15.071 --> 09:16.872
You fixed it!

09:16.906 --> 09:19.809
Yeah, we just had to r
e-install some software.

09:19.843 --> 09:24.247
- And I helped.
- Oh, thank you! Um....?

09:24.282 --> 09:29.084
Dale? Dale Kettlewell.
We've met a couple times, uh...

09:29.119 --> 09:32.486
At the End of the World party. And I
saw you at the Espresso Farm one time.

09:32.521 --> 09:35.622
Well, welcome to ZBZ! - Actually,
I've been here before, too.

09:35.656 --> 09:38.591
To talk to Casey about Bible Bunch.
And remember that time when you...

09:38.625 --> 09:40.826
Oh, I get it! You're being funny!

09:40.860 --> 09:44.328
OK, so guys, thank you so much for all
of your help. I really appreciate it.

09:44.363 --> 09:47.298
Just think of us as your
own personal Geek Squad.

09:47.332 --> 09:49.533
Spread the word. I could use the cash.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.402
- Not that you offered to pay.
- Another good one!

09:52.437 --> 09:55.105
- -
- Wait!

09:55.140 --> 09:58.242
Um... I just had a great idea.

09:58.276 --> 10:00.310
We were gonna do this bachelor
auction with normal guys,

10:00.345 --> 10:03.013
but why don't we do,
like, a nerd auction?

10:03.047 --> 10:06.583
That way we can help Gamma Psi and
the Cyprus-Rhodes nerd population.

10:06.617 --> 10:07.817
Nerd auction?

10:08.919 --> 10:10.585
I'll do it for ten
percent of the profits.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.153
- You're too much!
- OK, five.

10:13.188 --> 10:16.323
Well, I could invite the
entire campus, including Erika.

10:16.357 --> 10:19.125
How will it help me get a date
to advertise myself as a nerd?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.927
Girls like Erika don't like nerds.

10:20.961 --> 10:23.129
Rusty, weren't you listening
to Professor Clarissa today?

10:23.163 --> 10:25.030
I was distracted when she
kept doing the robot.

10:25.064 --> 10:27.164
You can market anything
in the right package.

10:27.199 --> 10:30.133
See, nerds make great boyfriends.
They are funny,

10:30.167 --> 10:33.469
they are smart and loyal, and they
can address all your high-tech needs.

10:33.503 --> 10:35.538
Which includes you, Rusty Cartwright.

10:37.474 --> 10:39.941
- Why not?
- Erika Miller, watch out.

10:39.976 --> 10:42.043
Here comes Rusty Cartwright
on the chopping block!

10:42.077 --> 10:44.478
- Auction block.
- You...

10:44.512 --> 10:47.047
...are gonna bring in big money
with that sense of humor.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.082
- Have you ever done stand-up?
- No.

10:49.117 --> 10:50.817
No, I have not.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.421
"You will succeed where others fail."

10:56.456 --> 11:00.625
Sounds like after three years, I'm
finally getting into Human Sexuality
class.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.927
What is the big deal
with that class, anyway?

11:02.961 --> 11:06.630
An entire class dedicated to sex,
complete with pictures of lady-parts

11:06.664 --> 11:08.064
and man-business?

11:08.098 --> 11:10.066
I won't look at the lady parts
if you don't want me to, though.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.734
Aw, you'd do that for me?

11:11.769 --> 11:14.903
Except that just leaves man-business.
So that's weird.

11:14.938 --> 11:18.839
Casey, I'm ready for my bedtime story.

11:18.873 --> 11:21.808
I have to read Mayor A
n-JELL-O by Thursday,

11:21.842 --> 11:23.643
and I couldn't find the book on tape.

11:23.677 --> 11:26.345
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

11:28.315 --> 11:31.684
Uh, is that blood on your pants?

11:31.718 --> 11:36.154
Huh? Oh! No, no, no.
Wine of the ancients.

11:36.188 --> 11:40.892
Evan and I got into an
altercation at Amphora today.

11:40.926 --> 11:44.094
Brett said he was gonna consider
how to "address our conflict."

11:44.128 --> 11:47.563
I hope he just kicks him out like the
university did Wade, Ferret and Jeremy.

11:47.598 --> 11:49.832
Well, at least you only
have to see him once a week.

11:49.866 --> 11:51.667
He and I are in the same pol
i-sci class this semester,

11:51.701 --> 11:54.636
not to mention our joint
IFC/Panhel meetings,

11:54.670 --> 11:58.139
- where I saw him today.
- Did you talk to him?

11:58.173 --> 12:01.608
He tried to get me to forgive him.

12:01.643 --> 12:05.311
He just keeps rationalizing by
saying he did it for the house.

12:08.281 --> 12:10.382
What? What'd I say?

12:10.416 --> 12:13.951
Hurting others for the
sake of the house.

12:13.986 --> 12:16.453
Isn't that kind of what
I did to Gamma Psi?

12:16.488 --> 12:20.123
- It's totally different.
- How?

12:20.157 --> 12:24.193
Because... Evan is a douche.

12:24.227 --> 12:29.197
While you are my amazing
and great girlfriend

12:29.231 --> 12:32.266
who promised me an erotic backrub
before we go to sleep tonight.

12:32.301 --> 12:35.736
Evan set out to screw us, OK?

12:35.770 --> 12:39.438
You only broke in to Gamma Psi
because you knew they cheated.

12:39.473 --> 12:43.208
- The rest was an accident.
- Right.

12:43.242 --> 12:47.144
So... ? - So,
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

12:47.179 --> 12:49.213
Twenty if Beaver's fussy.

13:00.850 --> 13:01.849
It feels so crunchy.

13:02.146 --> 13:03.049
What is wrong with my old hair?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.517
We don't have time to get into it.

13:06.551 --> 13:10.686
I thought the whole point of the nerd
auction was to celebrate my nerdiness.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.254
So why do I need a makeover?

13:12.288 --> 13:15.690
Rusty, think of me as your
own personal Photoshop.

13:15.724 --> 13:17.858
We are just retouching your nerdiness.

13:17.892 --> 13:20.094
Taking you from nerd to nerd-chic!

13:20.128 --> 13:22.728
Think Harry Potter or Tina Fey.

13:23.730 --> 13:25.063
Those are just people with glasses.

13:25.098 --> 13:28.600
Glasses. We have to
get you some glasses.

13:28.634 --> 13:32.837
Are you kidding me? The one no
n-nerdy thing I have is perfect vision.

13:32.871 --> 13:35.740
These will be nerd-chic glasses.
It's all in the packaging.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.608
But isn't it what's on the
inside that really counts?

13:40.477 --> 13:41.944
Oh, you're serious.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.947
Erika will never notice
your great interior

13:45.982 --> 13:49.717
until she is lured in by a ner
d-chic exterior.

13:49.751 --> 13:52.185
It's uto you though.
Get the date with the dream girl,

13:52.220 --> 13:54.554
<i>or spend the rest of your life reading
Us Weekly,</i>

13:54.588 --> 13:57.956
pretending you're the one
caught between two hot co-stars.

13:57.991 --> 14:01.225
<i>- I don't read Us Weekly.
- Sorry, that was me last night.</i>

14:01.260 --> 14:04.761
So what's it gonna be?
Crunchy, or lonely?

14:04.796 --> 14:07.831
- I guess crunchy.
- Good ansnswer.

14:16.539 --> 14:18.239
Oh! Oh, whoa...

14:18.273 --> 14:21.208
- What is that smell?
- Angie had a little too much to drink,

14:21.243 --> 14:25.211
and I guess I can't expect her to
clean it up because she's passed out.

14:25.246 --> 14:28.881
- Katherine, I am so sorry.
- She's gonna be fine.

14:28.915 --> 14:32.984
- I rolled her on her stomach.
- Not that. Um...

14:33.019 --> 14:35.120
I want to talk to you about the fire.

14:35.154 --> 14:38.289
- Do you have any new details?
- Well...

14:38.323 --> 14:40.357
And I want to thank you so
much for looking into this.

14:40.392 --> 14:43.427
I want to reassure you that I haven't
forgotten about the SongFest
investigation.

14:43.461 --> 14:45.462
I'm gonna get into that
just as soon as I can

14:45.497 --> 14:49.566
because I know that Ryan,
the theater judge, gave ZBZ a zero,

14:49.601 --> 14:53.837
- which is highly suspicious.
- You know what? Don't worry about it.

14:53.872 --> 14:56.674
SongFest is no big deal.
It's not a fire.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.308
No, but it is an injustice.

14:58.343 --> 14:59.609
So...

14:59.644 --> 15:00.777
...about your findings?

15:00.812 --> 15:02.846
I'm still finding, actually.

15:02.881 --> 15:05.082
I haven't found much.

15:05.116 --> 15:08.118
Well, it's only been a day,
so I won't expect a miracle.

15:08.153 --> 15:12.189
But I wanna tell you, Casey,
that I believe in you.

15:12.223 --> 15:15.359
And I really misunderstood
you when we first met.

15:15.393 --> 15:18.328
I thought you were a vapid,
amoral sorority stereotype,

15:18.362 --> 15:23.133
but you proved me wrong.
That seldom happens, so...

15:23.167 --> 15:25.201
Oh...

15:32.378 --> 15:35.480
Pardon me. I'm a professor.

15:40.251 --> 15:43.020
I'm narcoleptic. I need to
sign in before I fall asleep.

15:43.054 --> 15:44.187
Thanks.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.459
You know, my girlfriend's
in labor aCounty General.

15:49.493 --> 15:51.861
Can I cut in before the baby crowns?
If that's even the right term.

15:51.895 --> 15:54.063
See how badly I need this class? Thanks.

15:54.731 --> 15:56.598
Hey, can I... oh.

15:56.633 --> 15:57.699
Rebecca.

15:57.734 --> 15:59.467
So you knocked Casey up?

15:59.501 --> 16:02.102
Now what? Move to the suburbs,
live on love?

16:02.137 --> 16:04.306
You're not cutting in front of me.
I've been here since 7:00am.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.174
Oh, come on, I'd bet my own man-business

16:06.209 --> 16:08.009
that you tricked your way up the line,
too, little missy.

16:08.043 --> 16:09.745
Who needs trickery when
you look like this?

16:13.117 --> 16:15.484
Hm... No more banter?

16:15.519 --> 16:18.254
Things have to be awkward between
us now that you're dating Casey?

16:18.288 --> 16:21.289
No, but... - Let's hope we
both don't get into the class.

16:21.323 --> 16:23.191
You know she'll freak. It's a sex class.

16:23.225 --> 16:25.226
- Oh, she trusts me.
- Barf.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.994
Oh, don't "barf" me, Rebecca.
I've seen your soft side.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.863
You're not the completely alone type.

16:29.897 --> 16:34.367
No. And it just so happens I
did recently have an encounter.

16:34.402 --> 16:37.237
Sounds... like an alien.

16:37.271 --> 16:38.938
Do I know the space invader in question?

16:38.973 --> 16:41.341
Who cares? It's not like it's
going anywhere. It's just sex,

16:41.375 --> 16:44.343
which is the only thing that
actually works between men and women.

16:44.377 --> 16:45.544
Don't say that.

16:47.980 --> 16:50.315
Oh, my God. I don't know if I can be
friends with you while you're in love.

16:50.349 --> 16:53.318
It's really unsightly. - Rebecca,
you can make fun of me all you want,

16:53.352 --> 16:55.287
but I'd hate to see you
blow a chance to be happy.

16:55.321 --> 16:56.555
Do you really think I should go for it?

16:56.590 --> 16:57.657
I really do.

16:59.326 --> 17:00.893
The space invader is Evan Chambers.

17:02.596 --> 17:03.562
Barf.

17:04.964 --> 17:06.465
Thanks everyone for waiting.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.134
But you might as well go home.

17:08.167 --> 17:10.636
There is only one ad
d-in spot for the class,

17:10.671 --> 17:13.806
and Professor Dabia is very choosy.

17:17.277 --> 17:19.078
- Mine.
- That's what you think.

17:28.021 --> 17:31.022
- Who are you playing Risk with?
- Me, myself and Kettlewell.

17:31.857 --> 17:33.457
Nice glasses, J.J.

17:33.492 --> 17:36.126
<i>Hey, tell me, have you figured out how
Lost is gonna end yet?</i>

17:36.161 --> 17:40.830
For your information,
it's called nerd-chic,

17:40.864 --> 17:45.000
and Ashleigh said it's just the ticket
to getting me a date with Erika.

17:45.034 --> 17:47.435
She's picking out an outfit for me, too.

17:47.469 --> 17:49.303
Congratulations.

17:49.338 --> 17:51.572
And congratulations to the
left side of my brain,

17:51.606 --> 17:53.440
which has conquered Australasia.

17:53.474 --> 17:56.242
Come on, Dale, why don't
you let her make you over?

17:56.277 --> 17:58.844
Samir and all those
other guys are doing it.

17:58.879 --> 18:03.482
As groovy as that sounds, I'm not gonna
go behind the A&P with you to smoke
grass.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.917
Come on. Peer pressure?
That's beneath you, Rusty.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.319
And I don't need a makeover.
I already have glasses.

18:08.353 --> 18:11.455
It's about capturing the best
part of your nerd essence.

18:11.489 --> 18:13.890
So let me get this straight.

18:13.925 --> 18:17.593
You're a nerd, who wants
to look like a better nerd,

18:17.628 --> 18:19.962
in order to attract
someone who's not a nerd.

18:19.996 --> 18:22.264
You'd sing a different
tune if you experienced

18:22.298 --> 18:24.165
the magic of retouching for yourself.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.000
We don't believe in that in my church.

18:26.035 --> 18:28.335
- Turns you blind.
- Is that why you need glasses?

18:28.370 --> 18:30.137
TouchÃƒÂ©.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.711
Oh. Look, if you're here
to yell at me again...

18:39.746 --> 18:42.714
I'm sorry about that.
I wasn't being fair.

18:42.748 --> 18:47.117
- So you're here to apologize?
- Kinda.

18:47.152 --> 18:50.187
And to ask you how you deal
with the guilt. Because...

18:50.221 --> 18:53.323
- Because why?
- Because I feel guilty, too.

18:53.357 --> 18:55.157
About blowing me off at Panhellenic?

18:55.192 --> 18:59.561
For... burning down the Gamma Psi house.

18:59.595 --> 19:02.029
You burned down the
Gamma Psi house? - Shh!

19:02.064 --> 19:05.499
Inadvertently. But yes, kind of.
It was my idea.

19:05.533 --> 19:09.401
We broke in, and you're the only person
on this campus who can understand.

19:09.436 --> 19:13.071
So I need to know.

19:13.106 --> 19:15.573
How do you deal with the guilt
of getting those KTs expelled?

19:15.607 --> 19:18.609
Well... it happened.

19:18.643 --> 19:21.678
And there's nothing I
can do about it now.

19:21.713 --> 19:23.881
Well, the guilt is eating away at me.

19:23.915 --> 19:25.916
Especially because
Katherine is being so nice.

19:25.950 --> 19:28.418
And the ZBZs are, like, falling apart.

19:28.452 --> 19:31.121
It's getting so bad that I think I...

19:31.155 --> 19:34.958
I think I have to confess.
Is it like that for you, too?

19:34.992 --> 19:38.327
No. It's not. Because I
know why I did what I did.

19:38.361 --> 19:41.830
- But people got hurt.
- And I feel sorry for them.

19:41.865 --> 19:43.732
But how would confessing help?

19:43.766 --> 19:45.701
But maybe if I explain
that it was an accident?

19:45.735 --> 19:48.637
I should have probably done that to
begin with, and then everything would
be fine.

19:48.672 --> 19:53.208
Casey, listen to me,
OK? This is a big mistake.

19:53.242 --> 19:56.611
Maybe it is. But I can't
live with it anymore.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.088
Hey, Ashleigh.
You sure I don't look stupid?

20:15.122 --> 20:17.556
- Dale was making fun of me.
- He's just jealous.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.924
And how could you look stupid?

20:18.958 --> 20:21.092
You look like a nerd. A chic one.

20:21.127 --> 20:22.126
There she is.

20:23.228 --> 20:26.230
Oh, OK. Go.

20:27.499 --> 20:29.133
Work that sweater vest.

20:33.904 --> 20:37.406
- Hey, Erika.
- Do we know each other?

20:37.440 --> 20:39.041
We talked in marketing the other day...

20:40.310 --> 20:42.244
...about my engineering grant?

20:42.279 --> 20:46.481
Oh! Right, the research guy.
You look different.

20:46.516 --> 20:48.817
I didn't have glasses then.

20:48.851 --> 20:51.385
I'm Rusty, and this is for you.

20:51.420 --> 20:54.488
A nerd auction.
The ZBZs are selling you guys?

20:56.457 --> 21:00.059
- Will you be up for auction?
- I sure will be.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.495
- Three o'clock.
- Then I'll definitely be there.

21:03.529 --> 21:07.198
I'll see you then. Thanks.

21:14.605 --> 21:18.539
What an oddly-shaped room. - Yeah,
the trash chute cuts in a little,

21:18.573 --> 21:21.742
but I'm the only one of us
displaced gals with a single.

21:21.776 --> 21:24.878
- Presidential privilege, huh?
- Yep!

21:24.912 --> 21:27.280
So... I'm surprised to see you, Casey.

21:27.314 --> 21:29.681
But I'm glad you're here
so we can clear the air.

21:29.716 --> 21:32.916
Things got a little hostile last
semester and I really hate that.

21:32.951 --> 21:35.286
The fire made me realize
what was really important,

21:35.320 --> 21:38.755
so I was hoping we could start fresh.

21:39.924 --> 21:44.061
Funny you should mention
the fire because I...

21:44.095 --> 21:48.633
<i>Oh, my. Oh, look, Fiddler.</i>

21:48.667 --> 21:52.470
- You were saying?
- Um...

21:52.504 --> 21:55.472
I was the one who broke
into the Gamma Psi house

21:55.507 --> 21:58.374
and lit the candle that started the
fire that burned the house down.

21:58.409 --> 22:00.609
- But it was an accident!
- You what?

22:00.643 --> 22:03.478
I know. I'm so sorry,
but I just meant to break in.

22:03.513 --> 22:06.748
Why? - Um, I guess I
was just so surprised

22:06.782 --> 22:09.584
that Gamma Psi won SongFest,
so... - So you burned down our house?

22:09.618 --> 22:13.154
Yes. But I'm here now,
and I am taking responsibility

22:13.189 --> 22:15.557
and I am willing to
face the consequences.

22:18.226 --> 22:19.960
I appreciate you coming forward.

22:19.995 --> 22:23.730
I can only assume you're here
to try and make it up to us?

22:23.765 --> 22:28.136
Make it up to you? I guess... Like how?

22:28.170 --> 22:33.441
Hmm. Wait, I have an idea.
You could give us your house.

22:33.475 --> 22:34.642
You mean, like, for the weekend?

22:34.676 --> 22:37.311
Don't be silly. How is that gonna help?

22:37.345 --> 22:38.779
I mean until ours is rebuilt.

22:38.813 --> 22:41.648
The contractor says it'll take a
year but you know how they are.

22:41.682 --> 22:43.983
Seems like a fair trade,
right? You burned ours down...

22:44.018 --> 22:47.588
But that's crazy. -...which seems like
a big job for such a slender girl.

22:47.622 --> 22:50.191
See, I don't think you acted alone.

22:50.225 --> 22:52.826
- But I did.
- Not buying it.

22:52.860 --> 22:54.894
So unless you want me
to implicate the entire

22:54.928 --> 22:58.797
ZBZ sisterhood, you're gonna
have to give up your house.

22:58.831 --> 23:02.102
And then we'll call it even. - But
we're doing a philanthropy for you.

23:02.137 --> 23:04.104
And we really appreciate it.

23:16.383 --> 23:18.685
Let me guess. You're staking
out Professor Dabia's car

23:18.719 --> 23:19.953
to flirt your way into the class?

23:19.987 --> 23:22.923
Sex professors are
notoriously ambisexual.

23:22.957 --> 23:24.457
So I figured I'd give it a shot.

23:24.492 --> 23:26.727
Hmm, great minds think alike.

23:26.761 --> 23:30.297
See, that's where we part ways, because
I would never think of dating Evan.

23:30.332 --> 23:33.333
Why do you even care?
You and I barely talk,

23:33.368 --> 23:35.168
so who says you have the
right to tell me what to do?

23:35.203 --> 23:37.671
Oh, maybe I don't.
But I do care about you,

23:37.705 --> 23:39.973
and getting involved with
Evan would be a big mistake.

23:40.007 --> 23:43.343
If you really care about me,
you'll let me have the spot in class

23:43.377 --> 23:44.644
and stop telling me what to do.

23:44.678 --> 23:46.646
- Not a chance.
- Hi, Professor Dabia.

23:49.316 --> 23:51.550
You kids these days are shameless.

24:11.171 --> 24:12.438
- Casey?
- Hi. Hey.

24:12.472 --> 24:14.006
What are you doing?

24:14.040 --> 24:16.942
I'm just trying to figure
out how to tell Ashleigh

24:16.977 --> 24:19.145
I just lost the ZBZ house.
Or how to tell Cappie

24:19.179 --> 24:22.815
that I'm getting expelled,
and I am talking to you about it.

24:24.951 --> 24:29.421
What happened? - I confessed,
and Natalie wants the ZBZ house

24:29.455 --> 24:31.689
in exchange for her silence.
Of course she wants our house!

24:31.724 --> 24:34.458
How did I not see this coming? - How
could you? It's completely insane.

24:34.493 --> 24:37.061
I know, and I'm starting
to think Natalie is, too!

24:37.095 --> 24:39.964
Having our house, on top of all the
sympathy they got from the fire,

24:39.999 --> 24:41.399
is exactly what she wants right now.

24:41.434 --> 24:43.735
She's hell-bent on keeping
Gamma Psi number one.

24:43.770 --> 24:45.604
And I'm still convinced
one of them, probably her,

24:45.638 --> 24:46.905
rigged SongFest.

24:46.940 --> 24:50.910
Well then, you know what?

24:50.944 --> 24:53.746
- You might not be totally screwed.
- What do you mean?

24:53.780 --> 24:56.549
Well, Natalie clearly
doesn't want to turn you in.

24:56.584 --> 24:59.185
It serves her needs to
work outside of the system.

24:59.220 --> 25:02.289
So maybe you fight fire with fire.

25:02.323 --> 25:05.724
Uh... - That's bad choice
of words. I'm sorry.

25:05.759 --> 25:08.393
Huh. - What I'm trying to say is:
if you do think

25:08.427 --> 25:11.429
that Natalie was up to something
shady during SongFest,

25:11.463 --> 25:12.997
maybe you should find out what it was.

25:13.031 --> 25:18.203
Hmm. It's a really good place
to start. Thanks, Evan.

25:20.306 --> 25:21.572
<i> </i>

25:21.606 --> 25:25.274
<i>* Hey you Feel me *</i>

25:25.308 --> 25:28.977
<i>* Was it worth an apology *</i>

25:29.011 --> 25:32.146
<i>* Someday you'll see *</i>

25:39.554 --> 25:42.557
- Erika's not here yet.
- Oh, yeah? Really?

25:42.591 --> 25:43.892
But you wore glasses.

25:45.260 --> 25:48.262
Look, some of our ladies are here.

25:54.669 --> 25:56.003
Oh...

25:56.038 --> 25:57.339
<i>* Someday you'll see *</i>

25:57.373 --> 25:59.708
<i>* Believe me *</i>

26:01.778 --> 26:05.047
<i>* Someday you'll see *</i>

26:05.081 --> 26:06.782
<i>* Believe me *</i>

26:06.816 --> 26:10.051
- What are you doing here?
- Ash, I didn't know you'd...

26:10.086 --> 26:12.854
This is a private party. And my bar.

26:12.888 --> 26:14.322
Yeah, I'm sorry. We can just go.

26:14.356 --> 26:15.823
Good idea.

26:18.727 --> 26:21.162
He looked puffy anyway.

26:21.931 --> 26:25.000
<i>* Suddenly *</i>

26:26.803 --> 26:31.074
Hey, Ashleigh, are you OK? - Yeah,
I had to run into him sometime.

26:31.108 --> 26:34.077
All right, guys, ready to do this?

26:35.546 --> 26:40.751
- Rusty?
- Oh, hey. Is it Diana?

26:40.785 --> 26:43.087
Dana. For the second time.

26:43.121 --> 26:45.089
She's here.

26:53.198 --> 26:54.831
Let's go.

26:57.765 --> 26:59.964
Good afternoon, everyone.

26:59.999 --> 27:02.899
So let's get started. -

27:04.769 --> 27:10.106
OK, great. So, all the proceeds... -

27:11.175 --> 27:14.177
Ninety-five percent of the proceeds

27:14.211 --> 27:17.847
go to help Gamma Psi rebuild
from their tragic fire.

27:17.881 --> 27:23.018
So, ladies of CRU, why settle for
the same old fraternity guys?

27:23.052 --> 27:28.122
Our nerds can impress your parents
and program your computers.

27:28.156 --> 27:31.454
So, let's start with...
Rusty Cartwright.

27:31.488 --> 27:33.555
-

27:38.327 --> 27:41.462
Rusty is the winner of
an engineering grant.

27:41.496 --> 27:45.766
Which is a really big deal.
He once built his own DVR

27:45.800 --> 27:48.468
and look how cute he is.

27:48.503 --> 27:51.738
- So, do I have any bidders?
- Twenty dollars!

27:51.772 --> 27:53.606
- Twenty-five!
- Thirty!

27:53.640 --> 27:56.542
Maybe I'll get two girls tonight.

27:58.278 --> 28:01.145
- Nice.
- Forty dollars!

28:01.180 --> 28:02.279
Fifty dollars!

28:02.314 --> 28:03.914
Going once, going twice,

28:03.949 --> 28:06.784
and sold to Erika from Tri-Pi.

28:12.592 --> 28:16.762
How sweet. But don't be fooled!

28:16.796 --> 28:18.964
He looks nice, but as
soon as he gets a chance,

28:18.999 --> 28:23.469
Rusty will cheat on you, just like
every other guy in the history of the
planet!

28:29.849 --> 28:33.251
Do we have thirty? Thirty for thi
sizzling electrical engineer?

28:33.285 --> 28:36.187
What was that all about? Ash, hey!

28:36.221 --> 28:37.988
You sabotaged me in front of everyone.

28:38.022 --> 28:39.288
You were supposed to help me get a date.

28:39.323 --> 28:42.324
One date. One date with one girl.

28:42.358 --> 28:44.192
But the minute another girl bid on you,

28:44.225 --> 28:45.392
you were all over that, too.

28:45.427 --> 28:46.894
It's an auction.

28:46.928 --> 28:50.930
It was a joke! Is this about Fisher?

28:52.032 --> 28:53.632
OK, I'm not Fisher.

28:53.667 --> 28:55.501
I'm starting to think all
guys are potential Fishers.

28:55.535 --> 28:58.571
Oh, that's not fair.

28:58.605 --> 29:01.408
I saw you blow off that science
girl who tried to talk to you.

29:01.442 --> 29:03.276
You may be a nerd,
but you're not very nice.

29:03.311 --> 29:05.513
Yes, I am!

29:05.547 --> 29:07.716
- Fifty!
- And sold!

29:07.750 --> 29:09.518
To the vixen with the
retainer in the front row.

29:16.694 --> 29:20.631
Oh, my God! Ryan Yarlbrough.

29:20.665 --> 29:22.967
In la flesh. Do I know you?

29:23.001 --> 29:26.404
Uh, well, I guess you
could say I'm a fan.

29:26.438 --> 29:30.073
You're such a talented actor.
Are you rehearsing a new play?

29:30.107 --> 29:31.808
<i>Hair.</i>

29:31.842 --> 29:34.577
Is that the one where
everyone gets naked?

29:34.612 --> 29:38.715
It's so much more than that.
But yes, I will be nude in it.

29:38.749 --> 29:41.851
Awesome. Um...

29:41.886 --> 29:45.321
Is it cheesy if I ask
you for your autograph?

29:45.356 --> 29:48.224
You're kind of famous on campus.

29:48.258 --> 29:51.326
Weren't you one of the
celebrity SongFest judges?

29:51.360 --> 29:55.127
I was going to ask you there,
but I got kind of star-struck.

29:55.162 --> 29:58.330
You were at SongFest?

29:58.364 --> 30:02.367
Yes. Um, and I'm wondering,

30:02.401 --> 30:05.736
as an actor and celebrity
SongFest judge,

30:05.771 --> 30:09.206
how does one, um, prepare?

30:10.908 --> 30:12.976
- In the theater...
- And in SongFest judging?

30:13.010 --> 30:16.946
Sure. It's all about authenticity.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.947
<i>For instance, last semester when I did
Fiddler,</i>

30:18.982 --> 30:22.717
<i>I was able to transport myself to
fin de siÃƒÂ¨cle tsarist Russia</i>

30:22.752 --> 30:24.986
by eating nothing but
beet soup for two months

30:25.020 --> 30:29.156
<i>- and growing a beard.
- "Fiddler"... on the Roof?</i>

30:29.190 --> 30:32.258
Yes. So, are we gonna
go get a drink, or what?

30:32.293 --> 30:35.360
I'd love to, but won't Natalie mind?

30:35.395 --> 30:38.963
Natalie? - Yeah,
I think I saw you with her?

30:38.998 --> 30:42.899
- Isn't she your girlfriend?
- No, I am single and available.

30:42.934 --> 30:45.268
Natalie and I just made love.

30:45.302 --> 30:48.837
In exchange for giving ZBZ
a zero in SongFest, right?

30:51.240 --> 30:55.710
You know, sex as a negotiating
tactic in the theater is universal.

30:55.744 --> 30:57.812
We're noas puritanical as the rest of y.

30:59.014 --> 31:00.281
And yocan't prove ything.

31:00.315 --> 31:01.882
Uh, maybe I can.

31:01.916 --> 31:06.019
Um, it was so nice to meet you, Ryan.

31:12.357 --> 31:15.159
I thought you might be a little
hungry after all that bidding.

31:15.193 --> 31:19.129
Oh, that's nice,
but I'm actually on this cleanse.

31:19.164 --> 31:22.999
No problem. Oh, I wanna reassure you,

31:23.033 --> 31:26.035
despite what Ashleigh said,
I'm no cheater.

31:26.069 --> 31:29.137
That's fine. So how's tomorrow nigh

31:29.171 --> 31:31.641
Can you come by Tri-Pi around eight?

31:31.676 --> 31:34.879
Eight is great. It's a date.

31:34.913 --> 31:39.383
And don't forget your tools. -

31:39.418 --> 31:42.590
Tools? - A few of the other
girls might need you, too.

31:42.624 --> 31:44.659
We all pooled our money
together to bid on you.

31:44.693 --> 31:47.395
- How many of you?
- Six? Seven?

31:47.429 --> 31:49.430
- -
- You can start with my TiVo,

31:49.465 --> 31:51.265
and I know Pam's laptop
has been acting up.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.067
Would you also be willing to tutor?

31:53.101 --> 31:55.635
Our house GPA sucks this year.

31:59.706 --> 32:03.843
I can't believe we missed the nerd
auction. I always wanted my own nerd.

32:03.877 --> 32:05.710
Well, maybe next year.

32:05.745 --> 32:08.212
Easy for you to say. You have Rusty.

32:10.348 --> 32:11.549
Bing just landed.

32:22.595 --> 32:24.830
I don't like that look
in your eye, Rebecca.

32:24.864 --> 32:26.832
You shouldn't have tried so
hard to get me not to date Evan.

32:26.866 --> 32:30.268
You can have the spot in human
sexuality class. Just walk away.

32:30.302 --> 32:33.003
You know I hate following orders.
Sorry, Cap.

32:33.037 --> 32:35.606
Wh...

32:35.640 --> 32:38.676
I can't believe she's gonna hook
up with Chambers just to spite me.

32:38.711 --> 32:41.346
When someone's a friend, you have
to let them make their own mistakes.

32:42.514 --> 32:44.515
Like when you let me lick that battery.

32:44.549 --> 32:47.017
That was a mistake.
But you had to let me make it.

32:48.353 --> 32:49.720
Three times.

32:53.991 --> 32:55.725
- Hey.
- Hey!

32:57.094 --> 32:58.161
It's good to see you.

32:59.263 --> 33:02.365
Yeah, sorry to leave
you hanging like that.

33:02.399 --> 33:06.101
At the Fairy Tale Ball.
Maybe I can make it up to you?

33:07.403 --> 33:08.836
You mean, like a date?

33:12.573 --> 33:15.842
- Yeah, like a date.
- Then it's a date.

33:15.876 --> 33:16.976
OK.

33:27.753 --> 33:30.756
Thank you so much for meeting
me on such short notice.

33:30.790 --> 33:32.891
- Ow!
- Sorry.

33:32.926 --> 33:36.495
Uh... I assume you're here
to offer me the ZBZ house?

33:36.530 --> 33:39.331
Uh, actually, we're waiting for
one other person to meet us.

33:39.366 --> 33:41.067
Sorry I'm late.

33:41.101 --> 33:43.536
So, what is this all about?

33:43.571 --> 33:47.707
Well, um... I'm here to give you
my final report about the fire.

33:47.742 --> 33:50.410
Really? - I really didn't
need to investigate.

33:50.445 --> 33:53.848
Because I know who started the fire.

33:53.882 --> 33:55.750
I did. But it was an accident.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.418
I was investigating
the SongFest judging.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.955
I know that is not an excuse,
but I hope it's a mitigating factor,

34:01.990 --> 34:03.190
and maybe someday you'll forgive me.

34:03.224 --> 34:04.558
For burning down my house?

34:04.592 --> 34:07.294
Fair enough, fair enough.

34:07.328 --> 34:10.664
I just couldn't stand keeping the
truth from you anymore, Katherine.

34:10.697 --> 34:12.532
Because I respect you so much.

34:12.565 --> 34:14.867
So much, I think that there is
something else you need to know.

34:14.902 --> 34:16.636
What could possibly top that?

34:16.670 --> 34:19.938
I confessed everything
to Natalie yesterday

34:19.973 --> 34:23.074
and in exchange, she blackmailed
me for the ZBZ house.

34:23.109 --> 34:26.879
Oh, and she was so
obsessed with beating ZBZ

34:26.913 --> 34:29.181
that she slept with
Judge Ryan Yarlbrough

34:29.215 --> 34:33.452
in exchange for Gamma
Psi's SongFest victory.

34:33.485 --> 34:36.721
Is that what all your provocative
lingerie is for, Natalie?

34:36.755 --> 34:39.958
You running around trading sexual
favors for Blue Ribbon points?

34:39.992 --> 34:42.226
You may think you're above
sorority politics, Katherine,

34:42.261 --> 34:44.228
but I am the one keeping us on top.

34:44.263 --> 34:45.931
And you can't prove anything.

34:45.965 --> 34:47.331
Those score sheets burned in the fire.

34:47.366 --> 34:48.766
Oh, um...

34:48.801 --> 34:51.436
Do you mean these score sheets?

34:52.839 --> 34:54.907
Oh, uh...

34:54.940 --> 34:58.310
Like I said, um,
do you mean these score sheets?

34:58.344 --> 35:01.046
- Where did you get those?
- Where else?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.914
Your house, the night of the fire.

35:02.948 --> 35:04.916
Looks like we both screwed up.

35:04.951 --> 35:08.820
But if your mistake comes out,
Gamma Psi's reputation will be ruined.

35:08.855 --> 35:09.921
Maybe for good.

35:12.759 --> 35:17.829
I think, before, you mentioned
something about the possibility of
calling it even?

35:19.699 --> 35:21.566
Right?

35:24.443 --> 35:27.144
And I was like " I burnt
down your house by accident,

35:27.179 --> 35:28.712
but you're a devious slut on purpose."

35:30.214 --> 35:32.315
Oh, Cappie'll be here any minute.

35:32.349 --> 35:35.850
Oh. My. God. So I can finally
tell the sisters it's over?

35:35.885 --> 35:38.719
Yep. Katherine will
never speak to me again,

35:38.754 --> 35:40.654
but there's nothing I can
do about that. - Casey!

35:40.688 --> 35:45.124
Hey Cap. Can you believe Casey?
She's like a sorority vigilante!

35:45.158 --> 35:48.560
I figured out a solution
to our Gamma Psi problem.

35:48.595 --> 35:51.063
And I had some help
from an unlikely source.

35:51.098 --> 35:54.233
Oh, hang on, I'm still imagining
you as a sorority vigilante.

35:54.267 --> 35:57.569
You're sweaty, hanging out in a ai
r-conditioning duct,

35:57.603 --> 36:00.538
with your biceps just
ripped to shreds. It's sexy.

36:00.573 --> 36:05.241
OK, OK... The unlikely source was Evan.

36:05.276 --> 36:08.243
Uh, don't be mad.
I thought he would understand.

36:08.278 --> 36:10.178
I know you think what I did
is different than what he did,

36:10.212 --> 36:14.950
but let's face it, you can't be
objective because you're my awesome
boyfriend.

36:14.985 --> 36:18.120
What is with the women in
my life giving this douche

36:18.154 --> 36:21.289
- endless second chances?
- Uh, the women in your life?

36:22.591 --> 36:24.559
That came out wrong. I meant Rebecca.

36:25.427 --> 36:27.061
That really came out wrong.

36:27.096 --> 36:31.032
OK, so when you were
asking Evs for advice,

36:31.066 --> 36:33.300
I was trying to give some to Rebecca.

36:34.068 --> 36:35.936
Advice, that is.

36:35.970 --> 36:37.937
Give some advice to stay away from Evan,

36:37.972 --> 36:39.639
and she wouldn't listen.

36:39.673 --> 36:42.708
Oh, Rebecca not listen to
someone telling her what to do?

36:42.742 --> 36:45.444
- I'm shocked.
- Is that weird for you?

36:45.478 --> 36:46.978
Me and Rebecca talking?

36:47.013 --> 36:49.480
We both might get into
that human sexuality class.

36:49.515 --> 36:52.950
Oh! Human sexuality? Perfect!

36:52.984 --> 36:55.519
And why would it be weird for me?

36:55.553 --> 36:57.921
It's not weird for you that
I talked to Evan, right?

36:57.956 --> 36:59.957
Of course not.

36:59.991 --> 37:02.359
I mean, that would make me a hypocrite.

37:02.393 --> 37:05.328
Yeah. It's not weird. It's normal.

37:05.362 --> 37:09.665
So normal, it's mundane! Yeah,
I'm bored by it.

37:11.367 --> 37:14.368
All these girls are fawning
over me, but to Erika,

37:14.403 --> 37:16.971
- I was just a nerd.
- I warned you.

37:17.005 --> 37:21.408
I, on the other hand, had a great night
with Bridget the biomedical engineer.

37:21.442 --> 37:23.714
Sure, she's got a couple of facial tics,

37:23.749 --> 37:26.050
but they were only mildly off-putting.

37:26.084 --> 37:28.919
And that retainer comes out,
if you know what I mean.

37:28.953 --> 37:30.955
No, not really.

37:30.989 --> 37:32.958
Hate to rub it in, but I'm
actually going to meet her n.

37:32.992 --> 37:36.128
Gonna use some of my cut from
the auction to buy her a cocoa.

37:39.532 --> 37:40.932
Well, see ya.

37:48.340 --> 37:51.308
I'm sorry for not remembering
your name at Dobler's.

37:52.578 --> 37:56.681
- Dana.
- Well, you should be sorry.

37:56.716 --> 37:59.084
We actually have a lot in common.

37:59.118 --> 38:00.785
And did you know that
I've had a crush on you

38:00.820 --> 38:03.721
since we met at orientation?
Of course not!

38:03.756 --> 38:06.190
You know, I liked you even
when you were The Anchor.

38:07.759 --> 38:09.593
You did?

38:09.627 --> 38:12.830
Guys like you are the reason my mother
wanted me to be a kindergarten teacher.

38:12.864 --> 38:16.934
Wait, what? - Kindergarten teachers
are girly and nonthreatening.

38:16.969 --> 38:19.670
But, oh, boy,
you become a female engineer

38:19.705 --> 38:22.306
and you just sentence yourself
to dying alone in a lab!

38:22.340 --> 38:25.943
I don't want you to die. - Because
even guys who are dorks, like you,

38:25.977 --> 38:29.213
they think they're too good
for you and want, you know,

38:29.248 --> 38:34.319
some hot sorority chick instead! But
where does that leave girls like me,
Rusty, huh?

38:34.353 --> 38:37.689
Yes, I know I'm a little of
f-putting when you first meet me.

38:37.723 --> 38:40.991
And yes, I had a lazy eye until
corrective surgery at age ten.

38:41.025 --> 38:42.626
And yes, I have two pet salamanders,

38:42.660 --> 38:45.529
which some people find weird, and, sure,

38:45.563 --> 38:48.531
sometimes I have gum in my mouth
and it falls out while I'm talking!

38:48.566 --> 38:52.936
But, you know, does that mean I don't
deserve a chance from a fellow nerd?

38:52.970 --> 38:55.504
That I'm not worth getting to know?

38:55.538 --> 38:59.107
Because I'm not just a nerd,
Rusty. I'm a woman.

38:59.141 --> 39:02.409
I'm a woman with needs.

39:07.750 --> 39:11.054
I will never forget your name again.

39:11.089 --> 39:16.458
Maybe I could...
buy you a cup of coffee?

39:16.493 --> 39:20.663
Are you freaking kidding me?
You blew it, Rusty.

39:20.697 --> 39:22.431
It is way too late!

39:26.971 --> 39:30.608
Sorry I'm late, brethren. I was
just delivering a crowning baby...

39:34.446 --> 39:37.581
Am I in the wrong abandoned
water pumping station?

39:37.616 --> 39:39.516
Looks like we're both out.

40:02.907 --> 40:04.508
Hi.

40:04.542 --> 40:07.110
Sorry I yelled at you.

40:07.145 --> 40:10.080
In front of every girl in school.

40:12.550 --> 40:14.484
So, how did it go with Erika anyway?

40:14.519 --> 40:16.620
It didn't.

40:16.654 --> 40:21.691
And Ash, I should have been more
sensitive to how it felt for you to
have to see Fisher.

40:21.726 --> 40:23.993
You deserve so much
better than that jerk.

40:24.028 --> 40:25.662
Thanks.

40:25.696 --> 40:28.631
Maybe I should have
bid on a nerd myself.

40:28.666 --> 40:32.302
Nerds can be jerks, too.
I've been a jerk.

40:32.336 --> 40:34.304
You know that engineering
girl from Dobler's?

40:34.338 --> 40:36.205
She liked me for a year and a half,

40:36.240 --> 40:38.274
and I didn't even notice.

40:38.308 --> 40:41.844
Yeah, she's awkward when you
first meet her, but so am I.

40:41.879 --> 40:44.514
Aw, well I'm sure you can get
her to give you another chance.

40:44.548 --> 40:47.183
I think she has too much sel
f-respect for that.

40:47.217 --> 40:49.318
Well, then she's missing out.

40:49.353 --> 40:52.521
Because any girl would
be lucky to have you.

40:55.959 --> 40:58.261
You're welcome.

40:58.295 --> 41:00.730
I can't believe you got us both in.

41:00.764 --> 41:04.867
- So Professor Dabia's straight.
- Oh, no. He's gay.

41:04.902 --> 41:08.704
Sorry, you're not his type.
But he thinks I'm fabulous.

41:08.739 --> 41:11.341
- Oh, of course.
- And Casey really won't mind

41:11.375 --> 41:12.642
us both being in a sex class?

41:12.677 --> 41:14.177
I'd tell you how much she trusts me,

41:14.212 --> 41:16.679
but I don't want you to vomit
all over yourself before class.

41:16.714 --> 41:20.183
- Thanks.
- Speaking of Casey, she, um...

41:20.217 --> 41:21.851
She said I have to apologize to you.

41:21.885 --> 41:24.654
I'm supposed to let the women in
my life make their own choices

41:24.688 --> 41:27.790
when it comes to the
people they associate with.

41:27.825 --> 41:32.061
Even if those people are
douches like Evan Chambers.

41:32.096 --> 41:35.331
Fine. Tell Casey I accept.

41:36.900 --> 41:38.434
So you going out with Chambers or not?

41:38.469 --> 41:41.004
- So much for butting out.
- All right. Fine.

41:41.038 --> 41:42.805
But just know, as your man friend,

41:42.840 --> 41:45.441
I will be there when he
inevitably screws you over.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.776
Don't worry about it.

41:49.112 --> 41:50.312
But thanks.

41:54.084 --> 41:55.884
Hi. Um...

41:57.654 --> 42:00.989
I'm here to return my VPJ clipboard.

42:01.024 --> 42:02.591
I'm assuming you'll need to replace me.

42:02.625 --> 42:04.159
Indeed.

42:09.165 --> 42:12.234
- OK. I'm just gonna...
- Which is a shame,

42:12.268 --> 42:14.469
considering you are clearly
clever enough for the job,

42:14.504 --> 42:16.805
given the way you bluffed
Natalie yesterday.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.107
What do you mean?

42:19.141 --> 42:21.376
I know those were not the
real judges' score sheets,

42:21.410 --> 42:23.078
because that was not my clipboard.

42:23.112 --> 42:27.415
Yours is hidden... too well.
I couldn't find it.

42:27.449 --> 42:30.618
So I bought an identical one.

42:30.653 --> 42:33.154
I'm... How did you know?

42:33.188 --> 42:35.022
The spring on mine is slightly rusted.

42:35.057 --> 42:38.860
It makes a very appealing
sproingy sound when opened.

42:40.062 --> 42:41.595
And I miss it.

42:41.630 --> 42:43.163
Sorry.

42:44.432 --> 42:47.167
So you're not gonna turn me in? Why?

42:47.202 --> 42:50.304
Can't you just see the headline?
"Sorority Mayhem.

42:50.338 --> 42:52.272
Sexual favors and fiery revenge."

42:52.307 --> 42:55.175
Lifetime would probably make
several movie adaptations,

42:55.210 --> 42:58.045
and they'd hire some mannish starlet
to play me because I'm tall.

42:59.214 --> 43:00.514
And I don't need that kind of publicity.

43:00.548 --> 43:01.782
Right.

43:02.984 --> 43:07.020
Um, you know, I bet I
could find your clipboard,

43:07.054 --> 43:10.223
- if I keep looking.
- You know what? Don't bother.
