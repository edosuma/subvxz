WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:05.474
The name Olivette means little to you.

00:05.672 --> 00:08.016
High-ranking member of the Grand Coven.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.382
The one who laid the charge against me.
She's come back to the States.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.149
Now would be an excellent time to strike.

00:14.348 --> 00:18.558
And take out a miserable old witch who's
been standing in my way for centuries.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.527
- No, that is not happening.
- What?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.598
Somethings come up. Olivette can wait.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.928
My peace is helping people. Working cases.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.331
- That's all I wanna do.
- Is this about the Mark?

00:27.528 --> 00:30.907
I'm done trying to find a cure.
The answer's not out there. It's with me.

00:31.098 --> 00:33.100
I'm gonna fight it till I can't anymore.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.371
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like? I'm leaving.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.914
Another petty manipulation.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.551
What do you want from me?

00:40.741 --> 00:45.690
Why, it breaks my heart to see
what a colossal numbnut you've become.

00:45.879 --> 00:51.522
Sad, bored wee boy on the throne who will
flop ass-up the second those Winchesters...

00:51.718 --> 00:55.723
...hunters, who'd as soon see you dead
as have you to tea, ask you to.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.403
You're their bitch.

01:07.467 --> 01:10.141
I detest all my sins
because of thy just punishment...

01:10.370 --> 01:12.873
...but most of all because
they offend thee, my God...

01:13.073 --> 01:15.610
...who art all good
and deserving of all my love.

01:15.809 --> 01:19.052
I firmly resolve with the help
of thy grace, to sin no more...

01:19.246 --> 01:21.783
...and to avoid the near occasion of sin.
Amen.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.552
I absolve you of your sins...

01:23.750 --> 01:27.061
...in the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.392
Amen.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.933
Go in peace, Terry. See you Sunday.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.594
That you will, Father.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.700
Majesty.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.667
- I beg you to speak with her.
- What now?

02:43.864 --> 02:46.708
Your mother remains vexed
with your highness...

02:46.900 --> 02:50.347
...and vents her frustration
by abusing the court.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.717
No one dares retaliate, of course.

02:52.906 --> 02:55.978
And, yes, one expects to suffer in hell.

02:56.176 --> 03:00.750
But I fear I've reached my limit. To wit:

03:05.052 --> 03:07.089
I mean, seriously.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.563
Mother.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.275
Yes, Your Royal Highness?

03:26.506 --> 03:28.076
You care to comment?

03:29.276 --> 03:33.782
Magnificent work
by an astonishing talent. Mm-hm. Brava.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.061
I always said you were two-faced.

03:42.255 --> 03:46.863
Look, Mommy, enough.
I know you're annoyed with me-

03:47.060 --> 03:49.040
Annoyed? No, Fergus.

03:49.229 --> 03:54.440
I am devastated, betrayed,
and brokenhearted.

03:54.634 --> 03:57.808
Because I wouldn't go begging
to a bunch of witches on your behalf?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.220
The Grand Coven is the supreme command
of all witchcraft.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.447
Without their sanction,
I am forbidden to practice.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.626
- Forgive me, I hadn't noticed you'd stopped.
- That?

04:08.815 --> 04:13.730
Parlor trick. I'm capable of greatness.
Given free reign, I'd be unstoppable.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.798
I am this close
to throwing you back into that dungeon.

04:16.990 --> 04:21.096
Heh, of course. Why not?
Why do anything but cause me more pain?

04:21.293 --> 04:24.275
Bad enough you wouldn't intervene
with Olivette and the Coven...

04:24.464 --> 04:28.674
...but you went directly against my wishes,
siding with those Winchesters.

04:28.902 --> 04:32.315
Refusing to kill them, then delivering
the First Blade into their hands...

04:32.506 --> 04:35.180
...which you know could slaughter us all.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.156
You prefer them
to your own flesh and blood.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.657
It's a bitter pill, Fergus.
After all I've done for you.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.619
And what exactly would that be'?

04:51.691 --> 04:53.693
I gave you life, Fergus.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.170
Without me, sunshine...

04:57.030 --> 04:58.976
...you wouldn't exist.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.626
All right, so I'm thinking,
uh, curse, maybe.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.530
Sam, a little help here, okay?

05:23.723 --> 05:26.897
I'm trying to stay busy.
You know, eye on the ball, not on the Mark.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.009
- This is a case till we know it's not.
- Sure. Yeah, you're right.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.872
- Three suicides, two weeks.
- They're not just suicides.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.307
They gutted themselves.

05:35.502 --> 05:40.178
And they took their sweet time doing it.
I mean, that had to be incredibly painful.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.853
I can't seem to find any link.
Between the vice either.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.081
Yeah, probably a curse.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.423
And this man, he was handsome?

05:52.652 --> 05:56.862
Exquisite. He took my breath away.

05:58.191 --> 06:02.230
But we are told not to speak so much
of the time before we joined the order.

06:02.429 --> 06:06.377
We all found our way to
this life for a reason.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.074
Was he yours?

06:10.604 --> 06:15.053
His name was Piero. An incredible artist.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.591
Sometimes I would pose for him.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.783
And he called me his muse.

06:25.685 --> 06:30.600
As you can imagine,
we spent hours, days with each other.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.205
I felt so free with him.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.905
I...

06:38.098 --> 06:42.444
...had never been close with a man
before that.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.745
So, what happened?

06:48.942 --> 06:53.413
I... I can't right now.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.388
It's okay.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.118
Really.

06:57.817 --> 07:01.230
We're a lot alike. You know?

07:02.589 --> 07:04.000
I think...

07:05.125 --> 07:09.096
...we're supposed to enter the convent...

07:09.296 --> 07:11.298
...for some higher purpose.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.142
But many of us chose this...

07:16.670 --> 07:20.015
...because of the things...

07:20.640 --> 07:22.745
...that overwhelmed us.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.190
So, what do we got? Terry Sloan.

07:27.414 --> 07:30.020
Ordinary guy, not a lot of friends,
but no known enemies.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.321
No relation to the other vies.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.932
Well, not necessarily.
He's Catholic, and so are the other two.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.123
This is Massachusetts.

07:37.324 --> 07:40.635
There are a lot of Catholics in
Massachusetts. You think this is a case?

07:40.827 --> 07:42.500
Who kills himself with a candlestick?

07:42.696 --> 07:45.336
- There's a billion better ways.
- But he did kill himself.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.809
So he's not a witch.
There was nothing hexxy found on him.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.675
Uh, possession?
Could have been a demon.

07:50.870 --> 07:55.944
The point of a demon possessing a living thing
is to, you know, possess a living thing.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.555
Okay, agent. Why don't you get that phone
back to the Bureau's crime lab...

07:59.779 --> 08:03.989
...and get it hacked like you told those guys?
We'll figure out what's going on with Terry.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.529
- Probably nude selfies.
- I'm feeling good about this.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.400
Amen.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.273
Hi, sweetie.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.614
You need to come to bed, Frank.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.046
You gotta be exhausted from all those
night hours you been putting in.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.415
Yup, yup. The old job's gotten
pretty demanding, all right.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.426
Liar.

09:38.645 --> 09:42.491
Oh, my God. No. No. Frank!

09:47.720 --> 09:51.065
I just can't believe Lisa McCarthy
would murder her husband.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.897
Right.
Well, his blood was all over her body...

09:54.094 --> 09:57.439
...and her prints were all over
the scissors that butchered him.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.075
- It's terrible.
- Yeah.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.405
We also have some questions.
For starters, she has no memory of it.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.175
The last thing she remembers is being here.
Frank had gone to confession.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.411
So if he happened to say anything
in the confession about, you know...

10:10.610 --> 10:12.180
...maybe problems with the wife...

10:12.412 --> 10:14.452
I'm sorry,
the nature of confession is confidential.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.820
Ah.

10:16.015 --> 10:19.360
Father, all of the victims
attended your church.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.590
Could you at least tell us
if they'd recently been to confession?

10:22.789 --> 10:27.363
Yes, these men were fairly regular. But then,
so are the majority of the folks here.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.937
- Father?
- Agents...

10:29.129 --> 10:32.167
...Sister Mathias is our director
of social services.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.346
I've asked her to show you around
and answer any questions.

10:35.768 --> 10:37.441
Sure.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.341
- Sister.
- Agent...?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.721
Allman. And this is Agent Betts.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.484
Sister, you're aware
of the recent string of deaths, right?

10:48.681 --> 10:51.321
Yes. A terrible tragedy.

10:51.518 --> 10:55.193
But I'm confused as to why you're here.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.198
These were all suicides, weren't they?

10:58.391 --> 11:00.166
Well, possibly not.

11:01.227 --> 11:02.297
Murders?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.305
Well, the actual method of killing
was all identical.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.406
Ah, the MO.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.148
Yes, indeed, the MO, heh.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.482
I'm gonna go, uh, ahem,
have a look around.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.146
Excuse me, sister. Agent Betts... Allman.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.347
Ahem. Okay.

11:22.649 --> 11:27.689
Sister, did you notice any change
in the McCarthys' lives?

11:27.887 --> 11:30.333
Fighting, drinking, cheating?
You know, the usual.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.595
"The usual"? A bit cynical, agent?

11:33.826 --> 11:37.672
Scissors to the gut
really bring out the grinch in me.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.109
Oh...

11:43.703 --> 11:47.549
Now, Lisa McCarthy said
that they were very devoted to each other.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.017
- Was that true?
- That always appeared to be the case.

11:51.211 --> 11:55.853
- But...?
- We're looking for a motive, aren't we?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.118
We are.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.096
An earlier victim's cell phone
showed angry texts...

12:01.287 --> 12:05.030
...between he and his girlfriend
because he'd been fooling around.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.696
- There were rumors.
- So Frank cheated on Lisa? So she lied to me?

12:11.531 --> 12:14.603
- Or she didn't know?
- My sources are excellent.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.645
- And you didn't hear it from me.
- Oh.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.991
I got a question. How does someone...

12:30.717 --> 12:34.130
...uh, like you, end up, you know...?

12:34.320 --> 12:36.994
Cloistered away from the world, heh?

12:37.223 --> 12:41.933
- Are you making fun of me, Agent Allman?
- No. No, no. I, uh...

12:42.328 --> 12:45.172
I guess I'm just wondering
how somebody quits...

12:45.398 --> 12:48.743
...one life for something
completely different...

12:48.935 --> 12:51.006
...and then believe in it so much.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.846
Well...

12:54.741 --> 12:58.279
...in my case, I felt I had no choice.

12:58.478 --> 13:02.585
My life had become painful.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.927
There was hopelessness.

13:05.952 --> 13:12.961
I felt I had to find something larger
than myself to focus on.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.000
A kind of mission, I guess.

13:19.265 --> 13:23.042
You have no idea what I'm talking about,
I'm sure.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.949
Don't be.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.616
Sister? A question.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.148
I'm sure it's a different question.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.356
Is there a cemetery nearby?

13:35.548 --> 13:39.394
You could say that. The entire
church is built over burial crypts.

13:39.619 --> 13:45.069
Oh. And have you ever heard or felt
anything strange or unusual?

13:45.291 --> 13:47.202
Unusual how?

13:47.393 --> 13:52.342
Spots in the building that suddenly get
cold. Or maybe you feel like you're not...

13:52.532 --> 13:53.704
Not quite alone.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.575
Rattling chains
and teacups that fly across the room?

13:58.304 --> 14:00.215
Sister, are you making fun of me?

14:01.207 --> 14:04.654
Really? The FBI believes in ghosts?

14:05.978 --> 14:07.548
I'm afraid I don't.

14:08.314 --> 14:11.557
If you'll excuse me, agents,
I have to get back to work.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.497
Mm.

14:17.857 --> 14:22.203
Tell me you didn't think that nun was hot.
I think she had a little thing for me too.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.171
Dean, she was married to Jesus.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.946
All right, so Frank cheated
on his wife, Lisa. All right?

14:30.169 --> 14:32.240
The whole theme of this case...

14:32.438 --> 14:34.918
...seems to be about guys
doing their women wrong.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.712
- Notice that?
- Yeah.

14:36.909 --> 14:40.789
But Lisa McCarthy was pretty convincing
she had no idea she killed her husband.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.687
Hot nun said Lisa had no idea
he was cheating on her.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.295
Maybe she was controlled
by someone who did.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.089
Again, nothing witchy.

14:48.287 --> 14:49.925
- Ghost?
- Hard to say.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.229
There's EMF in the church,
but it's built on a burial ground.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.872
You know all the victims recently
went to confession.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.309
- You think Father Delaney's involved?
- Or something surrounding the confessional.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.445
Sammy, how long has it been
since my last confession?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.411
You've never been to confession.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.812
Well, that's too long.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.283
You summoned?

15:13.479 --> 15:16.289
Royal Highness.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.486
Mother.
- Oh, he remembers.

15:19.719 --> 15:23.667
- What can I do for you?
- It's what I can do for you.

15:25.725 --> 15:31.437
I've been thinking just how wretched it
would be if my own raison d'etre...

15:31.631 --> 15:35.340
...wreaking havoc and pain on Earth,
were taken from me.

15:36.302 --> 15:40.808
I see how stifled you must feel.
And I sympathize.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.744
Does this mean that you'll go
to the Grand Coven on my behalf?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.783
Even better.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.853
I've brought the Coven to you.

15:53.486 --> 15:58.265
I believe you know Olivette,
High Priestess of the Grand Coven.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.531
Speechless with joy?

16:07.533 --> 16:10.480
You utter bitch.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.808
Bottom feeder.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.541
Ah. The storm before the storm.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.051
As you can see,
the iron chains render her powerless...

16:18.277 --> 16:21.656
...so you can plead your case,
exact your revenge.

16:21.848 --> 16:26.194
Whatever it is that puts a spring
back in your step. You kids have fun now.

16:30.056 --> 16:35.028
I see your time as outcast
has led you from vile to loathsome.

16:35.228 --> 16:39.699
I doubt this strategy of insults
will get you out of this pickle.

16:39.899 --> 16:46.077
Hmm. No. I do not grovel before she who lay
with a Non-Magic and hatched his spawn.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.851
My personal life was none of your business.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.813
I could've been your superstar.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.217
Oh, please.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.892
When we initiated your thankless ass
into the Coven...

16:56.082 --> 16:59.495
...we did overlook your private lapses
because of your talent.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.165
We thought you'd outgrow
your reckless, selfish ways.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.733
But, oh, no, they just grew out of control.

17:04.924 --> 17:08.701
And now look at you.
Consorting with demons.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.102
Quite the speech.

17:13.598 --> 17:17.069
Considering you're in my son's palace.

17:18.938 --> 17:19.939
What?

17:21.273 --> 17:25.222
You see, my son, the spawn you speak of...

17:25.411 --> 17:27.550
...is now the king of hell.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.387
Total Cinderella story, I'd say.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.057
Oh, aye.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.392
And now you, dearest Olivette...

17:36.589 --> 17:40.230
...are prisoner of the baddest of the bad.

17:40.426 --> 17:43.134
And his devoted Mommy.

17:43.362 --> 17:47.139
It was the sadness in your eyes.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.876
I saw myself there.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.645
Was it Piero?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.946
Is he the reason you're here?

17:55.141 --> 17:58.987
There is not much difference
between madness and devotion.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.154
I was obsessed with him.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.464
We shared each other's secrets.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.929
We were on the same road.

18:10.156 --> 18:15.162
I suddenly realized how deeply
in love with Piero I had fallen.

18:16.495 --> 18:20.739
He said it was only after I posed for him
that his work took on real power...

18:20.933 --> 18:23.004
...real expression.

18:23.803 --> 18:28.445
The painting I had posed for
was the beginning of his career.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.513
In the end, it was his masterpiece.

18:42.421 --> 18:49.270
Sweet Jesus. Nothing in my love life
was ever so magical.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.635
Magic can be ruinous.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.004
Especially if the trick is on you.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.542
I finally confessed my heart to Piero.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.444
I felt we could read each other's thoughts.

19:01.641 --> 19:06.454
But I said the words inside out loud.
"I love you."

19:06.879 --> 19:10.190
I waited, dying inside.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.987
And then...

19:12.818 --> 19:15.560
...he explained he had feelings for me...

19:16.022 --> 19:18.559
...but not of the same son.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.063
He loved another?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.509
Indeed.

19:25.698 --> 19:26.972
His art.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.976
It was everything to him.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.545
Insomuch that I affected it,
he cared for me.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.552
But beyond that,
he could offer me nothing but friendship.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.057
I fell into such despair.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.389
I could not eat, nor sleep.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.692
Until my family could stand no more.

19:49.889 --> 19:53.063
And that's when you entered the convent.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.364
It's as if I'd died.

19:56.195 --> 20:00.701
My father sent me there
to escape my sorrow and forget Piero.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.206
His servants dragged me from home
one night.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.844
All these things from my father's estate...

20:09.041 --> 20:11.419
...I never saw them again after that night.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.955
Everything that was mine was lost to me.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.019
Except my journal.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.225
Things I could say to no one.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.799
Things no one wanted to hear.

20:26.759 --> 20:30.400
- Loneliness is...
- Yes.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.906
It is.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.382
Really can't say I'm surprised.
You always were petulant.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.616
And reckless. And overrated.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.953
Banishment was too good for you.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.467
You were always so envious of my skills.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.800
You fool. The only threat
I ever posed to the Coven...

21:01.994 --> 21:04.338
...was that I was smarter,
more gifted than you.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.635
- More blindly ambitious.
- Why not?

21:07.833 --> 21:09.972
You nits were content
to live in the shadows...

21:10.169 --> 21:15.118
...dicking around with black cats
and broomsticks instead of greatness.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.323
- What was that one for?
- Emphasis.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.354
I will get what I want from you.

21:26.585 --> 21:27.757
No, you won't.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.025
Because what you are looking for
no longer exists.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.937
The Coven is a pale relic
of its past power.

21:35.127 --> 21:39.371
Weakened by witch hunts,
burning at the stake, endless persecution.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.477
- And all of it was engineered by them.
- "Them"?

21:42.668 --> 21:44.944
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.378
You're not as quick as I'd have thought.

21:47.706 --> 21:48.707
All right.

21:49.141 --> 21:54.557
It's a rabid group of sanctimonious
do-gooders dedicated to our downfall.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.957
- They had equal magic?
- Worse.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.562
Public relations.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.661
They whipped the church
and public into a panic.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.992
Our best were killed or driven underground.

22:07.193 --> 22:10.003
They then plundered
our spells and secrets...

22:10.196 --> 22:13.643
...and shipped them to hidden bunkers
all around the world.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.870
It appears you hate them
more than you do me.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.912
They tried to destroy our world.

22:19.138 --> 22:23.416
Hoarding unbelievable power
for their own amusement.

22:25.911 --> 22:28.892
Smug, self-righteous bastards.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.652
The Men of Letters.

22:36.755 --> 22:38.359
Yes?

22:38.924 --> 22:40.562
Hi, Father.

22:41.427 --> 22:42.599
Pardon me?

22:43.028 --> 22:45.440
Pardon you?
I thought it was the other way around, heh.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.075
Just...

22:47.266 --> 22:52.545
Ahem. So I'm here to clean house.
Need to get some things off my chest.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.911
Oh. All right.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.187
- Continue.
- Um...

22:58.744 --> 23:00.781
it's the women, Father.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.083
Where do I begin, heh?

23:03.282 --> 23:06.263
"Bless me Father, for I have sinned,"
is usual.

23:07.253 --> 23:11.565
Right. Good. Yeah. So that, and...

23:13.058 --> 23:16.767
So the women.
And this is not something I am proud of.

23:16.962 --> 23:20.739
But I let them think
that we have more of a future than we do.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.572
You know?

23:23.769 --> 23:25.646
Ugh, Gina.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.750
Gina?

23:28.407 --> 23:32.048
Don't get me wrong. I mean, she was...
It was good times.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.750
You know how it is. The sex, the lasagna.
But I was not honest with her.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.260
Sometimes I was seeing two,
maybe three girls at the same time.

23:40.452 --> 23:43.831
Sometimes in the same day.
Heh. You get the picture.

23:44.990 --> 23:48.494
And it wasn't just Gina. It was endless.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.607
- It's making me sick.
- And you wish to be forgiven, my son?

23:53.799 --> 23:55.403
I do. I need to clean up my act.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.582
As penance, you shall say five
"Hail Marys," two "Our Fathers"...

23:58.771 --> 24:00.773
...and reflect on your transgression.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.816
And then that's it? Then I'm good to go?

24:03.008 --> 24:07.320
One would hope
some inner exploration might occur.

24:07.513 --> 24:12.428
The prayers are just the beginning
to some serious soul-searching.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.029
Hmm.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.626
Anything else on your mind,
Agent Allman?

24:29.868 --> 24:31.870
What if I said...

24:32.871 --> 24:35.215
...I didn't wanna die?

24:35.541 --> 24:39.887
- Yet. You know, that I wasn't ready.
- Are you expecting to?

24:42.514 --> 24:44.357
Always.

24:45.050 --> 24:48.293
The life I live, the work I do.

24:49.822 --> 24:53.998
I pretty much just figured that
that was all there was to me, you know.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.230
I tear around...

24:56.795 --> 25:01.073
...and jam the key in the ignition,
and haul ass until I ran out of gas.

25:02.001 --> 25:06.211
I guess I just thought sooner or later
I'd go out the same way that I live.

25:06.405 --> 25:09.181
Pedal to the metal, and that would be it.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.219
But now?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.827
Now, um...

25:18.417 --> 25:22.388
...some recent events...

25:24.089 --> 25:27.593
...made me think I might be closer to that
than I really thought.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.032
And...

25:32.197 --> 25:35.735
I don't know.
I mean, you know, there's things...

25:36.602 --> 25:39.776
...there's people, feelings that I...

25:41.273 --> 25:43.879
I wanna experience differently
than I had before.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.920
Or maybe even for the first time.

25:47.112 --> 25:50.582
Go a little deeper perhaps
than with Gina?

25:52.618 --> 25:54.120
Yeah.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.767
Yeah, I'm just starting to think...

25:58.724 --> 26:01.466
...that maybe there's more to it all
than I thought.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.572
Learning there's more to the universe
than your tiny world...

26:05.764 --> 26:07.801
...can be a frightening discovery.

26:09.635 --> 26:12.445
Do you truly believe in God, agent?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.819
Because that can be a comfort.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.985
I believe there is a God.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.990
But I am not sure he still believes in us.

26:44.770 --> 26:45.908
So?

26:46.105 --> 26:48.949
- Think you had an eavesdropper in there?
- Hope so.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.143
Better watch your back. If we're right...

26:51.343 --> 26:54.517
...jerks like you
are just what our ghost is looking for.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.537
Isabella?

27:16.969 --> 27:20.712
Isabella? Are you here?

28:02.581 --> 28:07.530
I found no peace in the convent,
and my sorrow turned to rage.

28:07.719 --> 28:11.030
What was once Jove for Piero
had become hair's-d.

28:12.558 --> 28:16.267
One night I snuck out a window
and made my way to his studio.

28:17.262 --> 28:22.041
I'm not sure why I went. To confront him?

28:22.501 --> 28:25.710
To ruin the painting and destroy his love
the way he destroyed mine?

28:28.006 --> 28:29.747
There they were.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.643
Isabella.

29:15.153 --> 29:18.464
I never mentioned her to you
because it didn't occur to me...

29:18.657 --> 29:21.069
...she was connected with the murders.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.673
Ever since I've been here, I've come
across restless spirits of all sorts.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.136
They're all kind of...

29:26.331 --> 29:28.937
...sad. Harmless.

29:29.134 --> 29:32.172
And eventually
the poor things go to their final rest.

29:32.404 --> 29:36.113
Wait a second.
So you're just comfortable around ghosts?

29:36.308 --> 29:39.983
As a spiritual person,
I've accepted many planes of existence.

29:40.178 --> 29:44.149
And as I said, they've all been harmless.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.864
Isabella was my friend.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.635
We had a lot in common.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.635
Including...

29:57.029 --> 29:59.305
...painful love lives.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.808
I wanted to protect her.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.311
You said she showed up three weeks ago
when stuff from her home arrived?

30:05.504 --> 30:09.111
Yes. Part of a shipment
from a monastery in Tivoli.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.619
Her family's treasures
found their way to the Church.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.848
As with many of the great houses of Europe.

30:15.047 --> 30:18.187
You get that she got here
just before the murders started happening?

30:18.383 --> 30:21.728
I finally realized that.

30:21.953 --> 30:27.869
And then I heard the two of you,
and it made me wonder.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.166
That's when I read her journal.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.310
It was given to her father
right after her death.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.913
- Vengeful spirit. Just like we thought.
- Yeah, but 16th-century Florence.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.481
- She's probably buried in Florence.
- I assume.

30:42.808 --> 30:45.687
The journal ended right after her trial.

30:46.211 --> 30:49.522
Piero's death was so horrific...

30:49.715 --> 30:51.717
...she was convicted of witchcraft.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.760
They sentenced her to burn at the stake.

30:53.985 --> 30:56.522
If she burned, then so would her bones.

30:56.722 --> 31:00.363
Yeah, but, Dean, something here
is the tether that ties her to this place.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.540
It's probably the journal.
Where she wrote about her life.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.835
Why don't we see if we can't find Isabella
and try to slow her down?

31:07.032 --> 31:10.673
- And, Sam, burn all this stuff.
- Her journal?

31:12.104 --> 31:14.710
- Is that necessary?
- Believe me, it's necessary.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.113
I don't know. There might be more in here.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.788
Sam, burn it. Let's go.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.265
I'm telling you, I don't know any more.

31:31.456 --> 31:32.764
You're lying.

31:33.125 --> 31:37.870
Just as you lied about me all these years. You're
afraid I'll recover all the stolen potions...

31:38.063 --> 31:40.304
...and spells
and become more powerful than you.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.944
Oh, poor, poor Rowena.

31:43.135 --> 31:46.241
Always the victim
of one conspiracy or another.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.409
You're so consumed with your rise to power,
you can't see the truth.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.816
I see the truth. And it's pathetic.

31:53.044 --> 31:57.789
You let these Men of Letters pillage the greatest
trove of magical secrets in the world...

31:57.983 --> 32:00.725
...and did nothing.
- Ow!

32:02.320 --> 32:03.822
We were weakened.

32:04.055 --> 32:08.629
The plunder was dispersed
to bunkers all around the world.

32:08.827 --> 32:12.798
Those bunkers are powerfully warded.
There was nothing we could do to stop them.

32:12.998 --> 32:16.172
How do I find the Men of Letters?

32:16.401 --> 32:18.403
I don't even know if they exist anymore.

32:19.805 --> 32:23.844
I've heard that the American chapter
was extinguished in the 1950s.

32:24.075 --> 32:27.147
But apparently two of its members survive.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.924
The hunters. Sam and Dean Winchester.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.528
The Winchesters?

32:36.521 --> 32:39.001
Again with the Winchesters.

32:39.191 --> 32:43.435
Perpetually the Winchesters.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.800
Olivette, dear...

32:50.669 --> 32:57.553
...pleasant though this little chat
has been, I feel it's come to a close.

32:58.276 --> 33:03.851
What you're telling me is that the Coven
is no longer all-powerful, and therefore...

33:04.049 --> 33:06.461
...that you are no longer useful.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.131
You'd better be careful, Rowena.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.892
There's a line that cannot be crossed.

33:12.123 --> 33:15.730
Witch-on-witch murder is anathema
to the community.

33:15.961 --> 33:17.804
The community, heh?

33:18.330 --> 33:19.638
Who needs them?

33:20.532 --> 33:25.003
To think of all the years I've
lived in fear for nothing.

33:27.372 --> 33:30.182
You ruined my life, Olivette.

33:31.376 --> 33:34.380
And you shall pay with yours.

33:38.149 --> 33:40.925
Rowena, please, you don't want to do this.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.028
Please, Rowena, don't do this.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.366
Rowena, please.

33:50.929 --> 33:52.067
Please, stop.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.351
I haven't thought this through.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.960
Why should I kill you
and give you an easy way out...

34:13.184 --> 34:16.630
...when there are far better options?

34:21.626 --> 34:24.607
No. No. No!

34:24.795 --> 34:27.208
Rowena, please. No...

34:29.801 --> 34:32.610
Oh. I'm a genius.

34:33.572 --> 34:38.748
I don't see how she could murder these
people if she was tethered to the church.

34:38.944 --> 34:43.824
She could possess a person inside the church,
ride out, and get yanked back after the kill.

34:44.382 --> 34:47.795
And can ghosts be shot?

34:48.485 --> 34:51.831
This is rock salt.
If we spot her, it'll slow her down.

34:57.062 --> 35:00.600
... and as the days passed,
my love for Piero deepened...

35:00.799 --> 35:03.336
...as did his belief in
my powers as his muse.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.272
He said he wanted something from me...

35:07.472 --> 35:10.510
...something he could barely give voice to.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.821
He thought the effect I had on his work
was profound.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.626
He had never painted so well before.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.992
He asked if he might have a bit of my blood
to mix into the pigment.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.535
Piero was so afraid he would hurt me.

35:26.758 --> 35:30.103
I told him, on the contrary,
it was my great joy to do this.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.032
Bu! it wasn't enough.

36:08.133 --> 36:12.138
I told Piero to grind the flesh, blood,
and bone into the pigment.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.811
I had completely become one
with the painting...

36:16.007 --> 36:18.487
...and with Piero.
- "And with Piero."

36:43.868 --> 36:48.283
She got to Father Delaney. Shes around here.
We gotta get you out of here. Come on.

37:11.863 --> 37:17.370
The priest had to die. He made it
his business to forgive you pigs.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.210
Forgive you
when what you do is unforgivable.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.386
Sam, burn the journal.

37:54.572 --> 37:58.145
Sister. Don't let them. You are my friend.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.696
You're... You're trucking.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.031
Is that her?

38:20.865 --> 38:23.846
Poetic justice, if you ask me.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.311
For hundreds of years,
those hags made me grovel.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.950
Every attempt to please them, futile.

38:29.140 --> 38:33.611
High time someone else ran in circles, eh?

38:34.879 --> 38:37.553
Nice touch.
Something I might have thought of myself.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.187
You see? We're not so very different.

38:41.386 --> 38:44.026
What is it that you want?

38:44.222 --> 38:46.634
Ah. Well, Fergus, since you asked...

38:46.825 --> 38:51.535
...these friends of
yours, the Winchesters...

38:51.729 --> 38:54.209
...I hear they are... What do you call it?

38:54.399 --> 38:55.901
Men of Letters?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.711
Possibly.

38:57.902 --> 39:01.213
- I see. Well, about that...
- Listen, we've been through this.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.216
My relationship with the Winchesters
is my business.

39:04.409 --> 39:06.582
I'll handle them. I'm not killing them.

39:07.912 --> 39:10.688
All right, dearie. Of course.

39:11.382 --> 39:13.885
Whatever you say.

39:29.434 --> 39:32.176
Who mixes their blood and bones
into paint?

39:32.937 --> 39:35.417
No woman's ever done that for me.

39:35.874 --> 39:40.186
Is this you thanking me
for not doing what you told me to do?

39:40.378 --> 39:44.554
You know, if you'd have burned the journal,
we wouldn't know how to kill her, would we?

39:44.749 --> 39:48.196
Heh. Yeah, you're welcome.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.796
You know...

39:57.462 --> 40:00.568
...you were in that
confessional a long time.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.477
Look, man, I'm just saying...

40:08.907 --> 40:10.284
...I'm your brother, Dean.

40:10.475 --> 40:13.251
If you ever need to talk about anything
with anybody...

40:13.444 --> 40:16.118
...you got somebody right here next to you.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.923
Okay.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.995
I heard what Sister Mathias was saying
about, you know...

40:26.424 --> 40:28.802
...hiding pain by taking on a mission...

40:28.993 --> 40:32.236
...and I know that's what you're doing,
a little bit.

40:32.430 --> 40:37.140
And it's okay. I mean, it's fine, I get it.
I've done it before too.

40:38.803 --> 40:43.946
But I don't buy for one second
that the Mark is a terminal diagnosis.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.987
So don't go making peace with that idea.

40:48.179 --> 40:52.286
There has to be a way.
There will be a way, and we will find it.

40:52.483 --> 40:54.292
That's what we do.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.263
So believe that.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.158
Okay, Sammy.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.131
You wanna...

41:04.996 --> 41:07.203
...try that again like you mean it?

41:10.301 --> 41:11.974
Okay.
