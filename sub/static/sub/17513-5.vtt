00:18.667 --> 00:20.439
I can't stand it.

00:20.668 --> 00:22.354
- What?
- The way you eat.

00:22.612 --> 00:24.588
- What do you mean?
- I hate the way you eat.

00:25.267 --> 00:28.498
- Why?
- You sound like a horse walking.

00:31.736 --> 00:33.567
I never know whether
you're having a sandwich

00:33.583 --> 00:35.177
or there's a cowboy coming.

00:35.366 --> 00:37.193
Well, you've never had
a problem with it before.

00:37.210 --> 00:38.684
I know, and I hate that I do now.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.627
Is this what happens when you
spend too much time with someone.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.879
No, it's... it's fine. When... when you

00:43.354 --> 00:46.547
drink your tea, you go, "ahh!".

00:46.667 --> 00:48.253
Makes me want to throw
the tea in your face.

00:48.331 --> 00:50.240
- That's a bit harsh.
- I'd wait till it cooled down.

00:50.253 --> 00:51.313
Thanks.

00:56.379 --> 00:58.611
Ah!

01:02.199 --> 01:03.901
Ah!

01:05.793 --> 01:08.998
Om nom nom! Nom nom!

01:09.064 --> 01:10.998
Ah! Oh, yeah!

01:10.999 --> 01:13.631
Nom nom, nom nom!

01:13.653 --> 01:16.497
- Nom, nom, nom!
- Ah!

01:16.553 --> 01:19.693
- Nom, nom, nom! Nom, nom, nom!
- Oh, that's good tea!

01:56.282 --> 01:57.853
Mum, are you sure you
need to come in today?

01:57.891 --> 01:59.430
You're supposed to be resting.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.969
I did, last night.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.998
No, that was sleeping.
You rest during the day.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.829
Is Emma coming? We need to get going.

02:04.836 --> 02:05.970
I'm coming!

02:08.199 --> 02:09.830
Small disaster.

02:10.312 --> 02:11.925
I dreamt I ironed this, but I didn't.

02:12.045 --> 02:13.796
We need to get going.
You can meet us there.

02:13.803 --> 02:15.372
No, I just need to iron
it. I'll be super quick.

02:15.394 --> 02:17.061
It's fine. You can take Daniel's car.

02:20.468 --> 02:21.468
Please don't crash it.

02:21.588 --> 02:22.667
I mean, I know you
wouldn't do that on purpose,

02:22.689 --> 02:24.502
but just please be careful.

02:24.668 --> 02:26.175
Also, please don't
change my seat settings

02:26.179 --> 02:28.200
or radio settings. Okay? Thank you.

02:28.368 --> 02:30.092
Hey, do you know where
there are any sick jumps?

02:30.109 --> 02:31.040
Funny!

02:47.989 --> 02:48.973
Morning.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.778
Yeah, sorry to interrupt I'm just
working down there on the road.

02:53.182 --> 02:54.620
Could I use your bathroom?

02:55.039 --> 02:57.388
- Oh, of course. Come in.
- Good.

02:57.823 --> 02:59.822
- It's all right. It's just on the right.
- Right.

03:17.620 --> 03:18.823
Come on.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.554
Where's my stapler?

03:22.812 --> 03:23.777
Hm?

03:27.771 --> 03:29.201
Don't move it again.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.545
Mum, are you... are you ready?

03:31.764 --> 03:33.415
- For what?
- B-bace.

03:33.453 --> 03:34.321
B-what?

03:34.543 --> 03:36.715
- Okay, it means...
- What's this?

03:37.061 --> 03:38.086
Oh, that's Emma.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.094
She says if you smile while you talk,

03:40.159 --> 03:41.451
people can hear it on the phone.

03:41.986 --> 03:43.016
Listen.

03:44.511 --> 03:46.699
Thank you for choosing McCallum
real estate. This is Daniel.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.775
Thank you for choosing McCallum
real estate. This is Daniel.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.777
She... she is helping.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.844
- How?
- Well for starters, she's part of this.

04:01.869 --> 04:04.135
B-bace, boosting brand awareness

04:04.157 --> 04:06.022
through community engagement.

04:06.237 --> 04:07.801
The marker ran out before I finished.

04:09.787 --> 04:11.286
I'm going to take your
silence as excitement.

04:11.321 --> 04:13.066
- It's not.
- Okay, two ideas.

04:13.105 --> 04:15.391
First idea, Em and I are
gonna go door to door,

04:15.393 --> 04:17.502
- offering free appraisals.
- Good.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.154
Hm?

04:19.635 --> 04:22.320
Good. It's about time you
got a bit more proactive.

04:22.587 --> 04:24.531
Okay, sorry. Your support,
uh, threw me a little.

04:24.547 --> 04:25.904
Uh, second idea,

04:25.921 --> 04:27.956
I've booked us a regular
spot on the regional roundup.

04:27.983 --> 04:29.988
Just once a month, talking real estate.

04:30.288 --> 04:31.768
Might bring a few new people our way.

04:31.769 --> 04:33.320
- Good.
- Hm?

04:33.590 --> 04:36.503
I don't like talking on those
shows, but if you do, go ahead.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.320
Grace does that slot.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.786
Grace?

04:39.864 --> 04:42.087
Mm. She talks health stuff.

04:42.643 --> 04:44.224
That's where I learned
if you've got a migraine,

04:44.237 --> 04:45.620
you should sniff an apple.

04:45.887 --> 04:48.408
- Is that...
- Just don't be surprised if none of it works.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.084
Not everyone wants to
be bothered at home,

04:50.321 --> 04:52.122
and even less like having
their music replaced

04:52.135 --> 04:53.816
by people talking about real estate.

04:53.850 --> 04:55.122
Oh, Mum, it's going to work.

04:55.143 --> 04:58.138
I'm, uh, turning up
the B-bace on this one.

04:59.771 --> 05:01.137
Had that in my pocket all morning.

05:02.321 --> 05:03.438
Where are you going?

05:03.615 --> 05:05.321
I'm gonna go sniff an apple.

05:11.321 --> 05:12.321
Hello?

05:12.628 --> 05:14.580
Em, it's 10:00 AM. You
still haven't left yet?

05:14.778 --> 05:16.600
If you want to impress Mum,
this isn't a great move.

05:16.618 --> 05:17.747
I know.

05:17.777 --> 05:19.514
Did you tell her about B-bace?

05:19.854 --> 05:21.228
Yeah. She liked it. She said,

05:21.758 --> 05:23.464
- "good".
- Did she?

05:23.791 --> 05:24.640
That's great!

05:24.666 --> 05:25.825
Yeah, but you're supposed
to be doing it with me.

05:25.847 --> 05:29.134
- I don't want to doorknock by myself.
- Yeah, I know. I'm coming.

05:29.142 --> 05:31.201
Oh, and Grace is doing
the same slot on the radio.

05:31.546 --> 05:33.412
Are you going to strip to your
undies and try and kiss her again?

05:33.450 --> 05:35.201
Mm, good one. How far away are you?

05:35.247 --> 05:37.009
I am trying. It's just...

05:37.319 --> 05:39.452
there's a road worker in the shower.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.321
There's... there's a what?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.307
He asked to use the bathroom,
so I assumed he meant the toilet.

05:44.321 --> 05:46.320
- Oh, no!
- He's been in there for half an hour.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.365
Em, everyone knows

05:49.391 --> 05:51.485
- you do not let council workers in.
- What?

05:51.911 --> 05:52.799
What are you talking about?

05:52.807 --> 05:54.707
If you let one in, they
think they can all come in.

05:55.017 --> 05:56.320
They're not vampires.

05:56.396 --> 05:57.619
You seriously don't know about this.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.155
No! Is this some weird country
rule no one's ever heard of?

06:00.156 --> 06:02.066
Em, everyone knows
about this, okay. Just...

06:02.229 --> 06:04.061
- just tell him to leave.
- Fine!

06:04.078 --> 06:06.021
But... but don't piss him off or he'll

06:06.141 --> 06:08.321
- park a bulldozer in our driveway or something.
- What?

06:08.554 --> 06:09.735
Last time I visited,

06:09.855 --> 06:11.260
I tripped on a traffic cone.

06:11.321 --> 06:12.385
I got angry with them,

06:12.428 --> 06:14.022
and they glued it to the top of my car.

06:14.634 --> 06:15.589
Well...

06:16.335 --> 06:18.011
how am I supposed to
get rid of him, then?

06:18.823 --> 06:20.713
Just... politely.

06:30.488 --> 06:32.475
Oh, thanks. Great pressure.

06:32.595 --> 06:34.939
Isn't it? Anyway,
I've got to go to work.

06:34.969 --> 06:36.404
So if you don't mind...

06:36.451 --> 06:38.257
- Hey!
- Where did you come from?

06:38.287 --> 06:39.424
Sorry. I knocked, but...

06:40.062 --> 06:42.716
Mick, did you just have a
shower? You're the worst.

06:42.919 --> 06:44.320
Sorry about him.

06:44.569 --> 06:45.810
- Uh...
- Oh.

06:45.853 --> 06:48.291
I hate to ask, but do you mind
if I just heat up my breakfast?

06:48.321 --> 06:50.630
I forgot to eat before I
left because I'm an idiot.

06:51.074 --> 06:53.724
- Oh, I've gotta go.
- Yeah, it'll just take a second.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.084
Oh, the kitchen's over there.

06:57.204 --> 06:59.410
That is really cool of you. Thanks.

06:59.474 --> 07:01.559
Hey, put the kettle on,
will you please, mate?

07:01.564 --> 07:02.714
Yeah, mate!

07:36.116 --> 07:37.320
- Hello!
- Hi.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.015
- What's happened?
- Uh, nothing.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.080
- Nothing?
- No. Sorry.

07:40.089 --> 07:41.589
Uh, I'm from McCallum real estate.

07:41.614 --> 07:43.131
We're offering free appraisals

07:43.144 --> 07:44.467
so you can know the
value of your property.

07:44.501 --> 07:46.320
What? Hang on. Are
you selling something?

07:46.321 --> 07:47.910
Uh, no. Well I hoped you would be.

07:47.927 --> 07:50.463
Your house, that is. Have
you had an appraisal recently?

07:50.464 --> 07:51.675
Look, can you just give me a minute?

07:51.688 --> 07:52.843
I'll get my husband. He'll love this.

07:52.855 --> 07:54.239
Oh, if he'd be interested.
Yeah, that's great. Thank you.

07:54.299 --> 07:57.320
He really likes saying no to
people selling things. Graham!

07:57.440 --> 07:59.901
- If he's not interested, that's fine.
- It won't take a second.

07:59.931 --> 08:01.320
He's really good at confrontation.

08:01.321 --> 08:02.766
I don't want a confrontation.

08:03.156 --> 08:04.321
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

08:04.322 --> 08:07.570
- He's offering free appraisals.
- Oh, okay.

08:07.643 --> 08:10.556
So, instead of just leaving
a flyer in the mailbox,

08:10.599 --> 08:11.918
you're knocking on people's doors?

08:11.939 --> 08:13.988
- Yes. Uh...
- You know what you are?

08:14.231 --> 08:16.587
- Human junk mail.
- Okay...

08:16.596 --> 08:18.526
- Walking spam.
- Right.

08:18.548 --> 08:21.516
Uh, you're like a 3D...

08:21.697 --> 08:23.687
- talking brochure.
- Okay, I might get going.

08:23.709 --> 08:26.135
No, you're like a strip-a-gram, but
instead of taking your clothes off

08:26.173 --> 08:27.672
you're taking off layers of my patience!

08:27.685 --> 08:29.090
Strong finish. Thanks for your time.

08:42.462 --> 08:44.489
Hi. I'm from McCallum real estate.

08:44.493 --> 08:45.449
We're offering free appraisals

08:45.458 --> 08:47.104
so you can know the
value of your property...

08:49.085 --> 08:50.320
Hi. I'm from...

08:52.514 --> 08:54.862
Hi. I'm from, uh, McCallum real estate.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.012
We're offering free appraisals,
so you can know the...

08:57.650 --> 09:01.182
value of... of your property.

09:07.239 --> 09:09.156
No. No, no, no! No, no, no!

09:11.728 --> 09:12.856
Shit.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.795
- Em?
- Oh, hi.

09:17.915 --> 09:18.910
How's it been going?

09:19.030 --> 09:20.850
Not great. Have you got rid of him yet?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.320
They're just on their way out.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.436
They?

09:23.556 --> 09:24.470
Two.

09:24.590 --> 09:26.309
Another one came in to
heat up his breakfast,

09:26.321 --> 09:28.253
and I assumed he meant
microwave, but he meant stove.

09:28.262 --> 09:30.490
And then the stove stopped
working, so one of them's fixing it.

09:30.507 --> 09:32.411
Okay, well, just get rid
of them as soon as you can,

09:32.441 --> 09:34.157
after they fix the stove.

09:34.471 --> 09:35.906
How long's their break, anyway?

09:35.940 --> 09:37.237
They've finished for the day.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.201
Please get them out
of the house, nicely.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.521
Fine. I'll charm them.

09:45.321 --> 09:47.160
This has escalated.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.320
Ha! I think that's done it.

09:49.321 --> 09:50.482
- It's fixed?
- Yeah!

09:50.499 --> 09:54.213
Great. Well, guys, new
guys, this has been great.

09:54.235 --> 09:56.320
Oh, no! Is this chamomile?

09:56.579 --> 09:57.763
Are you okay, Joe?

09:57.883 --> 09:59.164
Oh, allergic.

09:59.422 --> 10:01.353
- Gives me nausea.
- Allergic to what?

10:01.405 --> 10:02.762
- To tea?
- I just need to...

10:03.158 --> 10:04.507
Hey, you need to lie down.

10:04.572 --> 10:06.534
Nah, you probably want
to walk it off outside.

10:06.537 --> 10:08.489
Yeah, okay. Is the bedroom through here?

10:09.764 --> 10:12.987
Hang on. Sorry. I'm gonna
need that Phillips head again.

10:13.181 --> 10:14.320
You're kidding.

10:22.904 --> 10:25.320
Em, I'm at the radio station.
We're going on soon. Where are you?

10:25.440 --> 10:27.167
I'm gonna feel bad if
you've been in an accident,

10:27.175 --> 10:29.321
- but otherwise you're supposed to be here.
- Ah, Daniel.

10:29.322 --> 10:32.427
Hi, um... Grace.

10:33.563 --> 10:36.320
You're here to do the,
uh... Do the... do the radio?

10:36.563 --> 10:39.320
Yes. And you're here to do the...

10:39.590 --> 10:40.796
Why are you here?

10:40.916 --> 10:43.796
Uh, real estate. I'm
here to talk about, um...

10:44.012 --> 10:47.303
- real estate stuff.
- Okay. Yes, that makes sense.

10:48.154 --> 10:50.669
Sorry about trying to
kiss you, uh, yesterday.

10:50.690 --> 10:52.769
Um... in my underpants.

10:53.076 --> 10:54.320
It was really bad timing.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.555
It's fine. It's not like
anyone schedules a kiss.

10:56.571 --> 10:58.774
- Yeah, yeah...
- Other than a wedding ceremony.

10:58.894 --> 11:01.838
But that's the only officially
pre-planned kiss I can think of.

11:01.881 --> 11:04.320
Yeah, or a, um... a play.

11:04.321 --> 11:06.761
Uh, any sort of scripted, um,

11:06.804 --> 11:08.321
performance. Anyway, I'm... I'm sorry.

11:08.321 --> 11:09.576
Actually, I'm glad you brought it up.

11:09.955 --> 11:10.939
- Oh?
- The mole scan found

11:10.965 --> 11:13.033
a few actinic keratoses.

11:13.550 --> 11:16.320
Is... is that horrible-sounding
thing good news, or...

11:16.321 --> 11:17.782
- Sunspots.
- Oh, okay.

11:17.816 --> 11:19.988
Very common in someone
with your complexion.

11:19.989 --> 11:21.680
- Great.
- Ugly, but fine.

11:22.321 --> 11:23.655
The spots, not you.

11:23.964 --> 11:25.635
- Thanks.
- You guys ready?

11:25.656 --> 11:27.208
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes!

11:30.321 --> 11:33.085
So, Scott, how many... how
many people listen in nowadays?

11:33.098 --> 11:35.655
Almost everyone here and
in the surrounding areas.

11:35.885 --> 11:37.475
Good.

11:37.595 --> 11:39.891
Remember when we used to go
on school excursions here?

11:40.321 --> 11:42.593
Yeah, I remember it being
pretty frustrating, actually.

11:42.623 --> 11:44.643
Yeah, I know. That's because it
was two hours of showing children

11:44.643 --> 11:45.936
buttons they're not allowed to push.

11:45.974 --> 11:47.590
- Yes. Yes, exactly.
- It's cruel.

11:47.611 --> 11:48.955
It is. It is.

11:49.156 --> 11:52.781
That said, I'm actually pretty
excited to meet, um, Pete Notch.

11:52.807 --> 11:55.292
Do you remember "Kick it
up a notch with Pete Notch"?

11:55.321 --> 11:57.320
Uh, he just swapped over
to the morning shift.

11:57.321 --> 11:59.156
Oh, okay. Who... who hosts now?

12:07.656 --> 12:08.656
Shit.

12:17.321 --> 12:20.321
Okay. Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

12:20.321 --> 12:21.740
Elka, stop reading that atlas!

12:21.758 --> 12:24.020
Everyone, listen to me! Thank you.

12:24.321 --> 12:27.320
First of all, thank you to
Mick for fixing the stove.

12:27.321 --> 12:28.066
Oh, don't mention it.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.875
I was hoping to reset the
element back into the...

12:30.190 --> 12:31.587
Sure! Whatever. But the thing is,

12:31.594 --> 12:33.593
I really need to go to work

12:33.620 --> 12:36.869
and this is getting out of hand,
and someone's brought beers now.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.320
And without being rude,

12:38.387 --> 12:42.201
it would really help me out
if you could leave, please.

12:42.321 --> 12:44.320
Oh, we... we get it.

12:44.994 --> 12:46.848
Listen, I don't want to do this.

12:46.906 --> 12:47.989
This isn't me.

12:48.016 --> 12:49.320
I like all of you.

12:49.321 --> 12:51.320
I want to hear your stories about

12:51.321 --> 12:53.351
traffic cones and play
cards and drink beer.

12:53.351 --> 12:54.321
Why can't you?

12:54.322 --> 12:55.936
Because, Matt, work.

12:56.056 --> 12:57.961
My friend's mum doesn't
like me as it is.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.320
Totally understand.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.201
She thinks I'm out there
doorknocking right now.

13:01.245 --> 13:02.322
Nah, fair enough.

13:03.154 --> 13:04.989
This is all terrible.

13:07.789 --> 13:10.095
- I'll have one beer.
- Yeah!

13:11.989 --> 13:14.320
So, just to be absolutely clear,

13:14.481 --> 13:16.773
eating tofu will not
turn you into a woman.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.930
Sorry, it's a patient.

13:22.321 --> 13:23.417
Hello?

13:23.908 --> 13:27.600
No... no, Mr Johns, don't
take it out yourself.

13:29.155 --> 13:31.536
All right. That was Dr Howlett

13:31.550 --> 13:34.114
taking a phone call
mid-interview. Let's, um...

13:34.278 --> 13:35.618
let's go to a song.

13:41.705 --> 13:46.319
Um, Bruce, I've been meaning to
apologise for the other night.

13:46.321 --> 13:48.903
Um, I'm... I'm sorry about the pub.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.156
No apology needed. It was funny.

13:52.989 --> 13:54.465
Uh, okay, great.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.320
I can't believe it. You
look exactly the same.

13:57.602 --> 13:59.320
Seems like a lifetime ago you were here.

13:59.321 --> 14:01.822
Yeah, yeah. It's been a while, yeah.

14:02.298 --> 14:03.479
All right, you ready to go?

14:03.500 --> 14:05.321
- Yep. All good. Yep.
- Right.

14:07.154 --> 14:10.923
And we're back. That track was... me.

14:10.966 --> 14:12.938
A little guitar ditty I put
together about a week ago.

14:12.965 --> 14:14.710
It's getting a lot of
airplay on the show.

14:15.431 --> 14:16.842
Are you ready for our next guest, Bruce?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.081
- Born ready.
- All right.

14:18.102 --> 14:22.156
We are joined by ex-Rosehaven
native Daniel McCallum.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.378
Uh, thank you for having
me. It's good to be here.

14:24.380 --> 14:25.321
Not a problem.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.715
So you're here to talk
about being a redhead?

14:28.203 --> 14:29.320
Uh, no.

14:29.483 --> 14:30.715
Being a virgin.

14:30.989 --> 14:33.985
- Uh, no. No. Real estate, actually.
- Oh, okay.

14:33.994 --> 14:35.985
So how hard it is to rent a property

14:35.989 --> 14:37.510
when you're a redhead and a virgin?

14:40.350 --> 14:43.155
Uh, no. We're offering free appraisals.

14:43.321 --> 14:45.025
Now, our listeners might not know this,

14:45.046 --> 14:46.684
but we all went to school together

14:46.757 --> 14:48.278
before Danny left for the mainland.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.764
- It's Daniel.
- Now he's back!

14:49.846 --> 14:51.005
Couldn't hack it.

14:51.707 --> 14:53.551
What did bring you back, Daniel?

14:54.121 --> 14:56.404
Well, uh... Rosehaven is a lovely place.

14:56.425 --> 14:57.951
Why wouldn't you move back here?

14:58.071 --> 15:00.045
I don't know. If you
moved away and died.

15:00.846 --> 15:01.932
Like Tina did.

15:01.975 --> 15:02.932
That was tragic.

15:03.776 --> 15:04.974
Tetanus.

15:05.814 --> 15:08.321
Shout out to Rodge and Ange, her
parents, if they're listening.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.349
Daniel, you were saying something?

15:27.321 --> 15:29.864
This week, McCallum real estate
is offering free appraisals.

15:29.877 --> 15:32.320
Okay, Daniel, genuine question,

15:32.812 --> 15:35.302
if I had enough money,
could I buy a cave?

15:35.321 --> 15:37.388
Follow-up question, if the
listeners at home have a cave,

15:37.427 --> 15:38.539
would you be able to
tell them what it's worth?

15:38.586 --> 15:40.589
Well, I mean, you
can't really own a cave.

15:40.709 --> 15:44.963
I mean, maybe if you owned a
block of land that a cave was on...

15:44.989 --> 15:47.746
Would the block of land be
worth more if you had a cave?

15:47.811 --> 15:49.732
It would be if there was
something valuable inside the cave.

15:49.754 --> 15:51.589
Guys, can we bring it back
to appraisals for a second?

15:51.606 --> 15:53.075
No, I think we should throw
this one out to the listeners.

15:53.105 --> 15:55.583
If you're listening at
home, do you have a cave?

15:55.596 --> 15:57.557
If so, what's inside it? Give us a call.

15:57.617 --> 15:59.413
You allowed to have any
pets in your cave, Danny?

15:59.430 --> 16:00.869
That's right, he took
your dog, didn't he?

16:00.882 --> 16:02.955
- Yeah, he was gonna shoot it.
- Oh! No, I wasn't.

16:02.956 --> 16:05.083
And you know you weren't
supposed to have pets.

16:05.768 --> 16:08.201
Ooh, hang on. We... we
have a caller on the line.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.003
- Hello?
- Hello.

16:10.123 --> 16:12.558
I'd just like to say, I think
Daniel sounds like a legend,

16:12.575 --> 16:14.308
and I would love to get
an appraisal from him.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.872
Uh, thank you, caller. We'd
be happy to help you out.

16:15.897 --> 16:16.910
No, thank you.

16:17.030 --> 16:19.611
Sounds like you've got a good
business, and a big penis.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.360
- That's fine, thank you.
- Oh, Danny!

16:21.390 --> 16:24.157
- You've got a fan there, mate.
- Hang on, hang on. Who's this?

16:24.321 --> 16:26.393
Oh, just a concerned citizen

16:26.393 --> 16:29.320
who thinks Daniel's the
best and you guys stink.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.321
- Emma?
- Nope.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.875
That's fine, caller. Thank
you. Get off the phone.

16:31.883 --> 16:33.735
Yes. I will. Go, Daniel!

16:33.899 --> 16:36.308
Oh, and the council needs to
allocate more safety wardens

16:36.321 --> 16:38.290
- to night roadworks. Whoo!
- Righto.

16:38.322 --> 16:41.069
Well, we do actually
have another caller.

16:41.112 --> 16:43.762
- Hello, Andrew.
- Hello. I've got a cave.

16:44.973 --> 16:47.093
That's great. Can you
tell me what's inside it?

16:48.071 --> 16:48.967
Just me.

16:57.321 --> 16:58.728
- Thanks.
- No problem.

16:58.736 --> 17:00.320
You looked like you needed a drink.

17:00.321 --> 17:02.488
Although, technically,
alcohol is a depressant.

17:02.877 --> 17:05.787
Yeah, well, it's my fault for
not knowing enough about... caves.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.201
I would've come to your rescue,

17:07.221 --> 17:09.319
but my knowledge of
caves is limited to...

17:09.565 --> 17:11.762
You know what? I don't
know anything about them.

17:13.829 --> 17:17.005
Um, I'm sorry again about yesterday.

17:17.789 --> 17:19.098
I don't know why,

17:19.219 --> 17:21.300
you tried to kiss me
and I didn't kiss you.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.546
- Yeah, yeah, I remember...
- You just leaned forward

17:22.555 --> 17:24.618
- and I leaned back.
- Yes, I was...

17:24.623 --> 17:26.569
And you've kissed me
before so I knew the look.

17:26.597 --> 17:29.406
It's just that this
time, we didn't kiss,

17:29.458 --> 17:31.978
because we're not together now.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.020
And I was at work.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.221
Yes.

17:37.093 --> 17:39.691
- Um... Grace?
- Yes?

17:40.881 --> 17:42.320
Two questions.

17:42.321 --> 17:43.935
Um, first question,

17:44.156 --> 17:46.267
is there any one food or drink

17:46.301 --> 17:49.121
- we can live off for the rest of our lives?
- Human breast milk.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.988
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:50.989 --> 17:53.100
The hard part, I guess, would be donors.

17:53.712 --> 17:55.321
Yeah. Yeah, that would be...

17:56.321 --> 17:58.973
Um, I mean, I'll put the word out. Uh...

18:00.103 --> 18:01.778
Second question is...

18:01.837 --> 18:04.067
would you like to kiss...

18:04.126 --> 18:05.321
now?

18:05.855 --> 18:08.144
Are you asking me rather than leaning in

18:08.156 --> 18:11.536
- because of what happened last time?
- Yeah. Yeah. Um...

18:11.905 --> 18:13.025
And also I've...

18:13.709 --> 18:15.982
missed kissing you.

18:17.321 --> 18:19.320
I've missed kissing you too.

18:19.688 --> 18:21.928
Well, that's good news. Um...

18:22.725 --> 18:24.023
So...

18:24.143 --> 18:25.321
So... yes.

18:25.526 --> 18:26.845
Great.

18:26.965 --> 18:28.046
Great.

18:29.156 --> 18:30.578
- Okay, well, I'll come sit next to you.
- Yeah.

18:30.594 --> 18:32.291
I'll... I'll pull the chair out

18:32.593 --> 18:34.801
for you in a gesture of goodwill.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.508
Uh, thank... thank you.

18:40.321 --> 18:41.989
Okay. Um...

18:54.321 --> 18:55.745
That was nice.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.509
Yeah. It was... better than
my last attempt, definitely.

19:02.251 --> 19:03.785
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

19:05.030 --> 19:06.521
I'm so sorry.

19:07.674 --> 19:08.429
Em?

19:08.483 --> 19:10.066
I thought I could do this, but I can't.

19:10.104 --> 19:11.574
I think I'm one of them now.

19:11.595 --> 19:14.321
- Hang on, what are you talking about?
- The council workers!

19:14.584 --> 19:17.320
There's so many of them.
I think I'm their leader.

19:17.321 --> 19:19.309
Hey... ! What? Why
do you need superglue?

19:19.321 --> 19:20.561
Hang on, I thought there were only two.

19:20.601 --> 19:22.446
I... I'm coming around.
I'm coming around.

19:24.526 --> 19:27.616
Uh... I'm sorry, I
have to... I have to go.

19:27.736 --> 19:29.400
- Emma-related?
- Yeah.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.320
- Were you guys ever... ?
- Oh, no, no. No.

19:32.624 --> 19:35.317
Uh, I mean not that she's not
great, but... is she behind me?

19:35.321 --> 19:38.480
Um, no. No. Um...

19:39.052 --> 19:41.893
Thank you, uh, for... kissing me.

19:41.906 --> 19:44.688
Um, that's a terrible
finish. Thank you for...

19:44.808 --> 19:45.792
- Help.
- Go.

19:45.839 --> 19:47.145
Thank you!

20:03.321 --> 20:05.320
That's a really nice colour on you.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.994
Yes. I think so.

20:09.989 --> 20:11.515
McCallum real estate.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.696
Mum. You're using the smile technique.

20:14.989 --> 20:17.514
Anyway, uh, you're still
there. That's great.

20:17.561 --> 20:20.155
Oh. Lucky I am. No one else seems to be.

20:20.156 --> 20:22.306
Yeah, sorry. Just got a
few things to take care of.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.853
- I'll... I'll pick you up at 5:00?
- Fine.

20:25.877 --> 20:28.156
- Tea?
- Read my mind.

20:32.055 --> 20:34.201
- McCallum real estate.
- Oh, hi.

20:34.214 --> 20:35.529
I heard some redhead on the radio.

20:35.550 --> 20:37.650
And I was calling about
getting an appraisal.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.765
You've gotta give people
a second chance, I reckon.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.671
- Then he robbed a petrol station...
- That's great.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.147
- And I'm still like, nah...
- Guys, seriously,

20:45.147 --> 20:46.942
I really need you to help me

20:46.963 --> 20:49.133
put everything back how
it was and then get out.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.019
Get out. Get out, get
out. Get out. Get out!

20:52.040 --> 20:53.753
We've just discovered
Elka's done circus training.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.321
She's gonna show us some new tricks.

20:55.322 --> 20:59.634
That sounds so awesome,
but no! No! No circus!

20:59.754 --> 21:01.153
Please... Wow.

21:01.175 --> 21:03.900
My friend Dan is on
his way and he's mad,

21:03.953 --> 21:07.320
and Barbara's going to be back
soon, and she is... scary lady.

21:07.321 --> 21:09.294
- Wait, Barbara McCallum?
- Yeah.

21:09.327 --> 21:11.007
- You need to get out...
- This is her house?

21:11.012 --> 21:13.350
- Yes!
- Oh, shit, everyone, it's over!

21:13.371 --> 21:15.068
This is Barbara McCallum's house.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.506
The mean machine's house?

21:16.549 --> 21:18.655
Move it if you ever want
to work in this state again!

21:18.656 --> 21:20.804
Hey!

21:21.078 --> 21:23.321
Wait, are you gonna help me clean?

21:24.126 --> 21:26.791
- Mick. Mick.
- We were never here.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.044
You were everywhere!

21:53.494 --> 21:54.655
What happened?

21:54.985 --> 21:56.687
I thought they were my friends.

21:58.321 --> 21:59.876
I'm never wearing this again.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.499
Or slowing down for
roadworks. I'm gonna speed up!

22:02.542 --> 22:05.111
No, I will slow down, so I can
give them the finger longer.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.759
Are you drunk?

22:06.879 --> 22:08.854
I was earning trust.

22:08.918 --> 22:11.508
Like you said. "Very
politely," you said.

22:11.546 --> 22:12.882
Well, it was too polite, Em.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.804
They found out it was Barbara's
house and then they ran.

22:14.826 --> 22:16.549
They talked about her like
she was some kind of...

22:16.576 --> 22:17.987
monster legend.

22:18.450 --> 22:21.320
- She's gonna put me in a tower.
- No, no, no, it's fine. I'll just...

22:21.660 --> 22:23.534
I'll pick her up from the office
after we've cleaned this up.

22:25.236 --> 22:26.321
Oh, shit.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.112
What happened?

22:31.844 --> 22:35.480
I... had... a party.

22:35.989 --> 22:39.321
The theme was... "Be messy".

22:41.597 --> 22:45.320
It was me. But it wasn't
a party. At the start.

22:45.653 --> 22:49.283
Daniel, can you join me in
the kitchen for a moment?

22:52.321 --> 22:54.321
It's worse in the kitchen.

22:56.392 --> 22:58.902
She's not from here. She
didn't know the rules.

22:58.967 --> 23:02.844
Where she's from, is it normal to
allow strangers to trash your house?

23:03.167 --> 23:06.387
That girl, actually no, grown
woman, she's taking advantage.

23:06.387 --> 23:09.141
- It's not like that...
- I think you should tell her to leave.

23:11.321 --> 23:13.172
Look, if... if you want her to go,

23:13.189 --> 23:15.187
that's fine. It's your house. But...

23:15.655 --> 23:17.056
if Em leaves,

23:17.395 --> 23:19.468
- I will too.
- Don't be so dramatic.

23:19.495 --> 23:21.741
I'm not. We'll stay at
the hotel or something.

23:21.978 --> 23:24.977
It's reasonably priced and they
have the muesli that I like.

23:25.683 --> 23:27.724
I can't have my son stay in a pub.

23:27.735 --> 23:29.959
- What would that look like?
- Well...

23:32.823 --> 23:33.838
Fine.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.418
But she can't be left alone
in the house from now on.

23:37.321 --> 23:41.118
Well, that won't be a problem
because... you'll be here.

23:41.321 --> 23:42.321
Will I?

23:42.322 --> 23:44.415
Yes. You can't just
pop pain pills all day.

23:44.426 --> 23:46.925
You can call the office as many
times as you like, but just...

23:47.178 --> 23:48.476
stay here for now.

23:48.503 --> 23:50.321
You'll heal quicker at
home and you know it.

23:54.492 --> 23:55.683
Also, love you.

23:59.108 --> 24:01.822
It won't be time off.
It'll be working from home.

24:01.823 --> 24:03.153
Of course.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.320
If you don't pick up in
three rings, I'll come down.

24:05.321 --> 24:06.750
Agreed. And we'll...

24:06.870 --> 24:08.285
We'll clean all this up.

24:08.635 --> 24:10.692
No. Emma will.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.321
Your mum doesn't like me, does she?

24:27.389 --> 24:29.979
She... does...

24:30.157 --> 24:32.602
Oh. What did she want to talk
to you about in the kitchen?

24:33.599 --> 24:34.977
Small talk.

24:35.872 --> 24:38.321
Small talk? With your mum?

24:41.344 --> 24:42.862
Em, I'm...

24:43.875 --> 24:45.603
I'm gonna go to bed.

24:45.723 --> 24:48.749
- It's half past four.
- Well, it'll be dark at some point.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.320
I'm really sorry.

24:50.321 --> 24:52.999
I did try. You know that, right?

25:19.577 --> 25:22.319
Jess from the op shop rang.
She says you may have a stalker.

25:22.321 --> 25:23.988
- That's my husband.
- Emma.

25:24.004 --> 25:26.362
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:27.321 --> 25:30.435
He won't leave until I forgive
him. So I guess he's moved here.

25:30.482 --> 25:32.772
Hey! Damien. What are you doing here?

25:32.892 --> 25:36.064
- Well, I'm home tomorrow, Emma.
- Okay.

25:36.321 --> 25:38.542
- He seems nice.
- Yeah.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.278
All right, that was a
track from bash teeth,

25:44.321 --> 25:47.078
that's Rosehaven's premiere
smash mouth tribute band.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.626
You're here with Maddrick at midnight.

25:48.656 --> 25:50.013
We've got a ripper show to get

25:50.054 --> 25:53.035
through, but we actually have
a caller on the line. Hello?

25:53.488 --> 25:55.174
Your show's shit, mate.

25:55.982 --> 25:57.823
- Danny?
- Daniel.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.188
No.
