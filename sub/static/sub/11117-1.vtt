01:45.480 --> 01:47.141
Open up!

01:49.735 --> 01:52.648
It's your dog, bro!

01:54.197 --> 01:56.780
We've got a warrant
for a Hector De la Taco.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.691
So send him on out.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.492
You've got the wrong house, ese.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.333
Why don't you let me worry about
that there, snookum?

02:18.055 --> 02:21.389
This is the FBI! Why the fuck don't you
open the fucking door? Let's go!

02:21.558 --> 02:27.600
That's cute. Look! You putas got ten
seconds to get the fuck off my stoop!

02:27.773 --> 02:30.014
- OK?
- "Putas"?

02:30.192 --> 02:32.274
Hey, man! You know what, man?
We got off to the wrong foot!

02:32.444 --> 02:34.185
You're damn fucking right we did!

02:36.281 --> 02:38.147
All right, man! Just take a step back

02:38.325 --> 02:39.926
and take another look
at our credentials!

02:42.120 --> 02:46.205
Officer McQueen, would you please show
this nice young gentleman your badge?

02:47.042 --> 02:48.532
I can't see shit!

03:49.312 --> 03:51.644
You ain't gonna need this no more.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.411
Stop it! If you had bothered
to learn the language,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.288
you know what you could
be saying to me right now'?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.371
Do you know what you could be saying?
You could be saying, "Hey, man",

04:12.544 --> 04:16.913
this is a big mistake.
I'm a Federale. I've got a wife!

04:17.089 --> 04:19.878
"I got a wife and I got a kid at home!
Please don't let me die!"

04:22.220 --> 04:25.929
But that's all you want to do!
Talk in your jibber-jabber.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.842
That would be like me going to Mexico
and expect everybody to speak American.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.229
God Almighty! I mean, what am I...'?

04:33.398 --> 04:36.140
You tell me what I'm supposed to do.
What am I supposed to do?

04:36.318 --> 04:39.652
All right, you've got a job. Right?
You clean toilets, or cut grass,

04:39.821 --> 04:42.984
or whatever the hell it is you do.
This is what I do.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.820
I shoot people in the face.
You understand?

04:45.994 --> 04:50.488
Somebody wanted you gone, you know
who they came to. This guy right here.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.454
You know? So I'm sorry.
But just so you know,

04:54.628 --> 04:57.996
this ain't nothing personal. All right?

04:58.173 --> 05:01.165
You ain't gonna believe this.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.084
Yeah?

05:04.262 --> 05:06.048
We got the wrong house.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.974
This shit ain't
gonna turn out well!

05:14.147 --> 05:18.357
You don't listen, man! You're
like MacGruber! Goddamnit, man!

05:18.527 --> 05:19.608
Well, ain't that some shit.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.668
- Sheriff?
- What's the story?

05:45.846 --> 05:49.805
It's just an all-out massacre.
Thirteen dead bodies, mounds of drugs,

05:49.975 --> 05:53.434
- guns, spit and <i>ass.</i> It's a mess.
- So who were these miscreants?

05:53.603 --> 05:56.220
No one appeared to be anybody special.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.264
Just run-of-the-mill
dealers and bangers.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.024
- Anybody talking?
- You know how it is.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.107
Nobody heard nothing, nobody saw
nothing, and nobody talks to the po-po.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.692
Yeah, that sounds about right.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.449
Fill out all the necessary paperwork,
run the bodies through the county.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.734
Have the report on my desk.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.119
Sir, I also took the liberty to go
ahead and put it out over the wire.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.749
See if we can get
a bead on these shooters.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.583
- Now, why would you go and do that?
- Trying to speed things along.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.504
- You think I can't do my job.
- I just thought...

06:26.678 --> 06:29.295
Don't do that! Don't ever do that.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.713
Just do as you're told.

06:37.272 --> 06:41.186
- Nothing?
- Nope!

06:42.777 --> 06:46.145
Not even half?

06:46.323 --> 06:51.068
Something's gotta change!
Risking our necks for no money.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.952
This some bullshit!

06:54.122 --> 06:58.207
I'm about tired of us getting fucked
six ways from Sunday, you hear me?

06:58.376 --> 07:02.040
Goddang, man!

07:03.214 --> 07:06.172
I was gonna put a pool in
with that money.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.010
Goddang, motherfucker!

07:14.643 --> 07:18.432
Stop! Yeah, walk away, bitch!

07:18.605 --> 07:21.688
You lucky I ain't in the mood
to whip your ass, boy!

07:21.858 --> 07:24.520
Wasting food, motherfucker.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.810
- Can I help you'?
- Shit!

08:05.902 --> 08:09.111
- Sorry. You scared me.
- That's what I do.

08:13.243 --> 08:17.703
I'm Celeste. I was hoping to talk
to you and your friends.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.115
Friends? I ain't got no friends.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.000
I've got my brothers.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.788
Got my house. My car.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.674
I've got a sexy little <i>chica</i>
standing in front of me.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.256
But I ain't got no friends.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.097
You wanna be my friend?

08:38.434 --> 08:39.971
I saw you this morning.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.933
I was hoping
to acquire your services.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.067
You got the wrong fellas.
We was at church this morning.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.102
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.487
So there's just three other white boys
that looked just like you

08:52.657 --> 08:54.864
that ripped up a whole house
on Bacon Street?

08:55.035 --> 08:58.244
Trying to figure out how you guys walked
out of there with all those witnesses.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.531
And every cop in the state
isn't lined up at your door.

09:11.426 --> 09:15.385
So, what's a pretty little girl like you
doing in a neighborhood like that?

09:16.347 --> 09:19.214
- Well, I was there to hire muscle...
- Hire him to do what?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.560
Get my godson back
from my ex-husband.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.768
Dibs.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.189
Dang it! Cock-blocking motherfucker!

09:36.785 --> 09:40.653
Lady, I'm not sure what it is
you think you're doing,

09:40.830 --> 09:44.744
but that's not exactly
our line of expertise.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.626
- I got money.
- How much?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.128
Ten thousand.

09:51.466 --> 09:55.710
Yeah, I don't think
saving people is really for us.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.128
You know'? Why don't you
take that shit to the cops?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.764
They'll do it for free.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.971
Twenty-five thousand.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.183
Five thousand up front.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.290
Come on inside and meet the boys.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.390
This is what I'm talking about.
Clean lines, nothing to profile.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.143
None of that spinner,
hydraulic shit to get you lit up.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.179
What I'm talking about, Sal, is you
transporting anything and everything

10:49.357 --> 10:53.100
in this pre-owned Hyundai Sonata.
And here's the reason why.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.067
Hidden compartment. Coated
with coffee bean and talcum paste

10:58.241 --> 11:00.403
no drug dog on the planet Earth
can sniff out.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.944
This space is worry-free,
and this time next month,

11:03.121 --> 11:05.203
I'm gonna have
a fucking fleet of them.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.707
- Damn, that's tight.
- Hear that, Dad? It's tight.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.270
So, what do you say, boys? You want
to take a few road trips for me?

11:15.383 --> 11:17.670
Abso-fucking-lutely, Carlos.

11:17.844 --> 11:24.341
We surely don't mind being your
fucking little mule, Don Carlos.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.430
But we gotta talk about our cut.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.934
We're the one doing all the risks.

11:32.901 --> 11:36.815
You know, I just remembered something.
I need batteries and toilet paper.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.570
And I need to get that Brad Pitt movie.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.607
The one where he turns back
into a fucking baby?

11:41.784 --> 11:44.742
Running low on milk, a few things.

11:44.913 --> 11:49.202
I wonder where I could get all these
items in one convenient location?

11:49.375 --> 11:54.996
- Walmart.
- Wal-fucking-mart. That's it.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.814
I love the way you put "fucking"
in the middle of a word like that.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.251
I'm gonna start using that shit.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.423
You see, guys, I kind of...

12:04.349 --> 12:09.469
look at my future empire as the
Walmart of bottom-dollar retail crime.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.184
But, you know,
we can't all be Sam Walton.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.732
That's my job.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.895
And when my foot soldiers
start talking about shit like cuts

12:20.073 --> 12:23.782
and percentages and things like that,
well, see, that's partner talk.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.865
And I don't need a partner.

12:27.038 --> 12:31.282
I need stockers and cashiers
and mercenaries and mules.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.325
And in your case, Padre,

12:33.503 --> 12:36.040
dime-bag dealers
from the lawn and garden department.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.581
Coincidentally, where I found you.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.343
Now, Padre, I like you. I really do.
I like your son too.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.346
I really appreciate all the shit
you've done for me, you know,

12:46.516 --> 12:48.598
that God wouldn't be proud of.

12:48.768 --> 12:53.934
But some things, you just have
to stop them before they start.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.269
See, partnership leads to ambition.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.855
Ambition leads to a word
they don't use much any more.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.609
Mutiny.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.218
- Papa, what's that?
- It's bad news.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.680
Listen up, dipshits!
This here is Celeste.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.893
And she'd like to give us an assload
of money to kidnap her godkid back

13:37.066 --> 13:39.854
from her deadbeat ex-husband.
That about cover it?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.110
- I guess so.
- Well, OK.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.521
Let me just find my
missing persons report here,

13:44.699 --> 13:47.066
and I'll get you right set up.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.951
You out your damn mind, brother'?

13:50.121 --> 13:52.613
The big fellow over there,
that's Lincoln.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.373
The mouthy little faggot here
is McQueen.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.159
And I'm Brick.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.752
Did you happen to mention that
kidnapping ain't exactly what we do?

14:01.924 --> 14:04.541
I was there this morning.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.923
You was at church?

14:11.100 --> 14:14.388
When I saw you guys take out that whole
house and walk out without a scratch,

14:14.562 --> 14:16.553
I knew I found my guys.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.518
<i>Bull sheet. What the catch?</i>

14:22.695 --> 14:25.653
Yeah. Why didn't you just
go to the cops with this?

14:28.576 --> 14:31.489
His voice box was crushed
when he was a kid. He can't talk.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.403
'Cause I told her we'd do it.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.164
Why would he go and do
a dumb thing like that?

14:36.334 --> 14:38.120
'Cause you guys are my only shot.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.376
I just want to get Rob
and take him away from all this shit.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.289
- That window closes Tuesday night.
- Do we look like FedEx to you'?

14:44.467 --> 14:46.424
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.176
- Shut up, man.
- You shut up.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.007
I'm talking to the lady.
Shut up, man!

14:50.181 --> 14:51.296
- Shut up!
- I just want peace of mind.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.181
That's something the cops can't give me.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.264
- And you think we can provide that?
- Yeah.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.082
If he's arrested, he'll just get out
in 18 months and hunt me down.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.686
This ain't Oodie Brothers Incorporated.

15:05.863 --> 15:12.155
It is now. She just gave us
25,000 reasons to open up shop.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.280
Five up front.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.081
Guys, it's what we've been waiting for.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.754
It's a chance.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.085
You wanted to be the last
true family man, Clark.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.669
OK.

15:31.848 --> 15:36.513
OK, lady. We'll take your money.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.438
We'll even get your kid back.
But if this man, this...

15:42.608 --> 15:46.351
- Carlos.
- If he's as crazy as you say he is,

15:46.529 --> 15:49.567
then why didn't he just kill
you in the first place?

15:53.035 --> 15:54.901
He tried.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.654
So when you leave,

15:57.832 --> 16:00.915
it would be great if Lincoln
could put a boot through his skull.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.632
You ladies have any other questions'?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.342
Henry, there's someone
in the back for you. In your office.

16:18.519 --> 16:23.355
- Who?
- Anthony Reese. He's an ATF agent.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.312
- Cute, too.
- Yeah. Thanks for that.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.648
I'll be sure to freshen up
before I go in.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.540
Agent Reese. Henry Millard.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.676
- Pleasure, sir.
- Well...

16:54.889 --> 16:57.677
- We don't see suits in here much.
- Yeah, I can see why.

16:57.850 --> 17:02.390
- How do people move in this heat?
- At our own pace.

17:02.563 --> 17:06.056
So... what can I do you for?

17:06.233 --> 17:10.728
Well, I wanted to ask you a few
questions regarding the shootout

17:10.905 --> 17:12.521
that occurred earlier today.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.939
We think we may have a lead
on some suspects.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.484
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

17:18.663 --> 17:23.453
It was a... It's an interesting region
you have over here.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.914
It seems every few months there's
a large number of violent offenders

17:27.088 --> 17:30.706
that go missing or show up dead,
but there's never any leads.

17:30.883 --> 17:35.298
Cases just... go away.
It's very weird.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.927
Well, I guess around here
finding justice for murderers

17:40.101 --> 17:41.717
isn't a top priority.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.561
Right. Do you know the Oodie Brothers'?

17:45.731 --> 17:49.269
I know all, son. But I can see you
came prepared for show and tell.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.526
So... get with the getting.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.610
All right. Prime suspects!

17:55.783 --> 18:00.949
Case dating back to their father,
Jonathan Warren Oodie,

18:01.122 --> 18:04.706
or Johnny Boy Oodie, <i>as</i> he was called.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.207
Guessing you would have loved this guy.

18:07.378 --> 18:10.837
Apparently, in his mid-twenties,
Johnny Boy got involved with the Klan.

18:11.007 --> 18:15.422
<i>Made things very colorful for local
law enforcement back in the day.</i>

18:16.220 --> 18:19.963
<i>Flash-forward, KKK just about
dumbed themselves out of existence</i>

18:20.141 --> 18:22.883
<i>and Johnny Boy went out
in a blaze of glory</i>

18:23.060 --> 18:25.927
<i>during a federal drug raid
in March of '86.</i>

18:26.105 --> 18:29.564
<i>No known mother to speak of, which
makes these three a Christmas miracle.</i>

18:29.734 --> 18:32.146
<i>Sound familiar to you, Sheriff? No?</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:35.529
<i>There were no grandparents or kin
suitable to take the children in,</i>

18:35.698 --> 18:38.235
<i>so they were sent into foster care.</i>

18:38.409 --> 18:43.074
<i>Then, when they became of age, they
started to become everyone's problem.</i>

18:43.247 --> 18:46.365
<i>The oldest is Brick.
He is Johnny Boy in the flesh.</i>

18:46.542 --> 18:49.955
<i>Can't seem to stay out of trouble.
And boy, does he love his guns.</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:53.793
<i>Then it looks as though they tried
to go legit for a minute.</i>

18:53.966 --> 18:58.176
<i>So they put their middle brother,
Lincoln, in Southern Circuit Wrestling.</i>

18:58.346 --> 19:01.429
<i>He ended up killing
seven men in the ring. And guess what?</i>

19:01.599 --> 19:05.308
<i>Absolutely nothing was done about it.
Nope. Promoters wouldn't charge him,</i>

19:05.478 --> 19:10.314
<i>saying it was accidental and part
of his neck-breaking gimmick.</i>

19:10.483 --> 19:13.726
<i>And to make this giant fucker
even freakier, he cannot talk.</i>

19:13.903 --> 19:16.065
<i>Or at least he couldn't
last time anybody checked.</i>

19:16.238 --> 19:19.526
<i>Wrestled under the name
the Dixie Reaper.</i>

19:19.700 --> 19:22.488
<i>And then there's McQueen.
Practically illiterate.</i>

19:22.662 --> 19:24.622
<i>He's the baby of the brood.
He was well on his way</i>

19:24.664 --> 19:26.450
<i>to becoming a real-life G.I.Joe.</i>

19:26.624 --> 19:29.207
<i>But he's got a bit of an issue
with authority.</i>

19:32.380 --> 19:34.587
That's a mighty fine
detective job you've done, son.

19:34.757 --> 19:38.796
- Thank you, sir.
- But... it ain't as easy as all that.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.635
- So you do know the Oodie Brothers'?
- Like I said, I know all.

19:44.809 --> 19:48.473
I can't just bring them boys in 'cause
some suit from Philadelphia wants me to.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.183
Well, you can if some suit

19:54.360 --> 19:58.149
from Chicago tells you to.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.862
The longer you stay down here,
the more you're going to realize,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.743
we don't like being
told what to do, son. Now...

20:05.913 --> 20:09.031
if you'll excuse me,
I got other work to attend to.

20:09.208 --> 20:13.452
No, Sheriff. Listen, I'm just asking
for, you know, a little cooperation.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.711
Once this thing gets wrapped up,
I'll get out of your hair.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.601
Why don't you let me
worry about my county'?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.446
We'll be in Dallas by midnight.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.404
I'll drive us
until I can't drive no more.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.404
Can you believe she went ahead
and paid us five grand up front?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.493
I know, right?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.627
I mean, you'd think she'd have
some trust issues, right?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.630
- But hey, each to their own.
- Each to their own, man.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.212
Each to their own.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.922
Now, I know we've got
an address to Austin,

21:07.099 --> 21:10.308
but shouldn't she have given us like
a picture of the kid or something?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.219
How many kids you reckon
they got up there'?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.478
I mean,
they ain't running a day-care center.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.315
- OK.
- Yeah.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.771
What if we get there
and Rob's a baby?

21:22.948 --> 21:25.815
Well, if he's a baby,
they got baby junk up there.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.073
- That's smart.
- It's not like they're riding around

21:28.204 --> 21:31.663
with a baby in a shoebox or nothing.
I mean, come on.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.826
Besides that, them bullet scars didn't
look too fresh on Celeste's belly.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.539
- You're right. You're right.
- Yeah.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.017
- What if there's more than one kid?
- Why are you asking me so many

21:49.141 --> 21:51.974
goddamn questions, man?
We just went over this! What?

21:52.144 --> 21:54.224
What do you want to know?!
What do you want to know?!

21:54.313 --> 21:57.726
- How will we know which is Rob?
- I'm gonna say which one's Rob!

21:57.900 --> 22:00.232
How about that? I'm gonna say,
"You know what, I don't want Kevin!

22:00.402 --> 22:02.282
I don't want Michael!
No, I don't want Stephen!"

22:02.446 --> 22:05.207
if there's a bunch of fucking kids
around I'm gonna say, "I want Rob!"

22:05.241 --> 22:07.778
How about that?
Fucking hell, man!

22:07.952 --> 22:10.034
It's a damn simple smash and grab!

22:10.204 --> 22:13.572
We smash whoever's in front of us
and we take Rob!

22:14.291 --> 22:18.285
Damn! Plain and simple!
What? Sorry, Lincoln.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.250
- I don't know why you have to yell...
- Your faggoty brother won't shut up!

22:21.423 --> 22:23.755
I'm inquisitive, and you know that!

22:23.926 --> 22:26.588
Where'd you learn that word?
Inquisitive?

22:26.762 --> 22:30.926
- Where the fuck did you pick that up?
- It's in my lexicon, man!

22:31.100 --> 22:33.011
- Jackass. Yeah?
- I've got it up here.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.665
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

22:34.812 --> 22:35.847
Are you ready for a potty break'?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.541
How many books you read, motherfucker?

22:50.995 --> 22:54.454
- Where are we?
- We're in Crockett.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.867
Davy Crockett. What time is it'?

22:59.044 --> 23:01.081
Four.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.257
Hey.

23:08.554 --> 23:13.048
I guess there's
a little candy in every pinata.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.930
Got some free shit!

24:02.107 --> 24:05.600
Take it easy, Van Damme! Hey.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.395
Hadji at the front desk said
we're only a few hours from Austin.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.064
Nice!

24:16.538 --> 24:19.246
- Who that?
- Fuck. Who do you think?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.874
Don't answer that shit, man!

24:22.044 --> 24:25.253
Don't answer it. Don't you...

24:25.422 --> 24:27.459
- Hey.
- Hey'?

24:27.633 --> 24:30.876
Don't hey me.
The hell are you'?

24:31.053 --> 24:32.464
<i>Texas.</i>

24:32.638 --> 24:34.424
Texas?

24:34.598 --> 24:37.198
Well, what in the Sam Hill could
you possibly have to do in Texas?

24:37.351 --> 24:39.558
Hey, man. Check this out.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.141
<i>Permian Stadium from
Friday Night Lights. It's on the way!</i>

24:43.315 --> 24:44.897
I took a job out here.

24:45.067 --> 24:48.230
You took a job!
Well, excuse me.

24:48.404 --> 24:53.114
What was I thinking? I forgot you guys
are freelance artists. So, Mr Brick,

24:53.283 --> 24:56.571
<i>- what job did you take?
- Look, it's not a big deal, man.</i>

24:56.745 --> 24:58.702
All right? It's just a little gig
out here. We can handle it.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.073
<i>You're going to handle it
like you handled me yesterday?</i>

25:01.166 --> 25:02.472
<i>It's bad enough you can't
check a damn address,</i>

25:02.626 --> 25:04.946
<i>but you also got to lay them
pork chops out in my backyard?</i>

25:05.087 --> 25:06.748
<i>- Put it on our tab.
- What was that?</i>

25:06.922 --> 25:09.755
- Nothing!
- You watch your mouth, son.

25:09.925 --> 25:13.213
This ain't a joke. This little misstep
is gonna be a pain for me,

25:13.387 --> 25:15.378
but you may have just stuck
your dick in a hornet's nest.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.138
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

25:17.307 --> 25:19.218
<i>I've got some jackleg
ATF agent up my ass,</i>

25:19.393 --> 25:21.475
looking to make a name
for locking up you idiots.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.058
The last thing I need is for you dumb
shits to draw more unneeded attention.

25:25.232 --> 25:29.442
I mean it, Brick. I better not hear shit
about your little Texas job.

25:29.611 --> 25:30.897
Keep your <i>ass</i> off the grid.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.028
<i>Don't call my house.
Write this number down.</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:36.941
<i>And for the love of God,
get rid of that damn cell phone.</i>

25:38.871 --> 25:41.704
- Yes, sir.
- Damn well better.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.412
You mess around and fuck up
my pension, that's your ass.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.043
I don't even know you.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.715
Hey!

26:00.893 --> 26:03.385
Check it out, man!
Permian Stadium!

26:03.562 --> 26:07.055
It's on the way, man!
You want to win, put bubba in!

26:07.232 --> 26:09.098
It's not on the way, jackass.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.984
It is, man! It's Odessa, Texas!

26:26.126 --> 26:30.415
Man! Don't take it out on me
because you got your ass chewed.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.330
We got work to do, boys.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.090
I'll get my badge.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.093
No. I figured we'd do
the old Roosevelt slammer.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.129
Fuck, yeah! -

26:41.100 --> 26:43.057
Dibs, bitch!

26:43.227 --> 26:47.221
Goddamn it, Montane! I didn't want you
to blow the place to hell and back.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.810
I don't give a shit! Would you fucking
listen to me every now and then?

26:50.984 --> 26:54.147
Please? Goddamn it.
Come here, baby. Come here!

26:54.321 --> 26:57.313
I don't know if your mama told you,
but you are hotter than shit.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.858
Goddamn.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.329
Fuck.
That's the shit right there, boys!

27:05.499 --> 27:08.662
From now on,
no more nickel and diming!

27:08.836 --> 27:11.168
You get it'? Only the finest!

27:11.338 --> 27:14.296
- Hey, how come she's not naked'?
- Don't know, boss.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.750
Find out.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.590
Hey. I'll call you when I need you.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.095
All right. Bye.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.644
Doesn't anybody know how
to use finesse any more?

27:56.466 --> 27:57.501
You all right'?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.794
- The helmet ain't work for shit.
- I told you.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.258
All right, you go east, I go west!

28:21.074 --> 28:24.692
Plain and simple. Smash and grab.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.839
Shit.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.716
My bad, lady. You OK?

28:42.846 --> 28:45.759
In my defense,
you do work for an asshole.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.191
You Rob?

29:10.207 --> 29:12.164
Brick!

29:13.460 --> 29:16.828
Goddang. Brick!

29:24.554 --> 29:26.761
Goddamn it.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.764
Fuck.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.769
Shit.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.308
Boss! Boss, are you all right?

29:42.197 --> 29:44.154
What the fuck
does it look like, Marty?

29:45.242 --> 29:46.949
It looks like a fucking bomb went off.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.705
Denny?

29:53.875 --> 29:57.038
- What the hell happened?
- The kid.

29:57.212 --> 30:00.671
- Say what?
- Three guys come in.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.708
Yes, I know three guys came in!
They came all the fucking way in!

30:03.885 --> 30:07.469
- I see that!
- They took the kid.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.848
Fuck! Goddamn it!

30:13.854 --> 30:17.472
They shot my motherfucking maid!

30:20.527 --> 30:23.770
OK, Marty,
I know it's over a year ago,

30:23.947 --> 30:27.781
but I need you to fucking think, OK?
You did kill Celeste, right?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.339
You wouldn't lie to me about that shit,
would you?

30:29.369 --> 30:32.612
I put three bullets in her gut.
She looked dead to me.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.406
But you didn't check to see
if she was dead, did you'?

30:36.752 --> 30:38.208
<i>Guess not.</i>

30:38.378 --> 30:41.496
That was our golden ticket,
you stinking fuck!

30:41.673 --> 30:44.506
How am I going to pay for this?
You got the dough?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.007
You got a fucking piggy bank
in your fat ass?

30:49.181 --> 30:51.843
Sorry, boss.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.510
OK. As long as you're sorry, I guess
that's all that matters, isn't it?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.350
I'll take care of it, boss. I'll make
sure it's right. I'll take care of it.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.980
Good, good. Thanks, thanks.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.610
Yeah. Hand me my goddamn pills,
will you?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.570
You still want to go look at that car?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.457
That Carlos man make you cripple'?

31:30.138 --> 31:31.879
<i>Hi, buddy.</i>

31:32.849 --> 31:34.465
I don't think he can talk.

31:36.103 --> 31:39.016
- Well, ain't this some shit, man.
- What?

31:39.189 --> 31:41.055
That he's all, you know...

31:43.151 --> 31:45.142
- Don't do that shit!
- What?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.732
'Cause you're being mean!
He can't help it.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.822
You OK?

31:51.493 --> 31:53.325
You hurt?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.829
You OK? He can understand us.

31:56.998 --> 32:00.457
How the hell did you get
"I'm OK" from that?

32:02.295 --> 32:06.664
Hey, look, buddy. We ain't going
to hurt you, all right? Celeste sent us.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.875
You know Celeste?

32:11.471 --> 32:16.136
Yeah! There he goes!
See? He understands us just fine.

32:16.309 --> 32:19.768
Once again, how the hell do you
know what he's saying?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.428
You the tard whisperer?

32:21.606 --> 32:22.937
You say that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.270
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- Say it again. You are making fun.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.186
- I'm not making fun. I'm just saying.
- You are making fun of him.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.481
It's just a little weird that she didn't
mention the poor little fella's

32:31.658 --> 32:33.865
- all buggered up, you know?
- It don't matter.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.619
She sent us to get Rob.
We got Rob. All right?

32:39.249 --> 32:41.240
You good, buddy'?

32:43.712 --> 32:45.123
- I wasn't being mean.
- You were being mean!

32:45.297 --> 32:47.038
You were making fun of him.

32:48.425 --> 32:52.464
Bless his heart.
He ain't got no control over that.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.592
It's a damn good thing
he wasn't in the living room.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.345
I'm just saying.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.896
Yeah, we can do that.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.955
We can get that done.

33:22.125 --> 33:26.744
All right, Carlos. I'm just
finishing up a little something here.

33:27.214 --> 33:31.458
Then we'll get on the road.
Don't you worry about a thing, sweetie.

33:35.305 --> 33:38.093
Excuse me, councilman.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.612
What? He wanted a bath.

34:07.504 --> 34:10.621
Another one already?
I didn't even get off.

34:10.799 --> 34:14.757
- It's for Carlos.
- Well, that makes it a bit better.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.123
Doesn't get much better
than this, Bill.

34:47.293 --> 34:51.333
It'd be better than this if the fish
was biting as well as these chiggers.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.426
You gotta be shitting me.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.929
This is where the real police matters
are handled?

35:01.099 --> 35:04.308
You mean on private property'?
Yeah, sometimes it is.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.593
Anthony Reese, ATF.

35:06.771 --> 35:10.184
- Bill Hawkins. Nice to meet you.
- Bill's a representative for the state.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.190
Nice to meet you, sir.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.065
Bill, have you heard about an
investigation going on in our area?

35:16.239 --> 35:17.479
No, I haven't.

35:17.657 --> 35:20.649
It seems Agent Reese was sent
down here to check up on us.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.488
Seeing as he's an Ivy League grad,

35:22.662 --> 35:24.782
I guess that makes him
better at our jobs than we are.

35:24.914 --> 35:25.995
Is he now?

35:26.166 --> 35:30.205
No. I'm not trying to intrude,
only assist.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.791
Sheriff, I feel
like we got off on the wrong foot.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.582
We're on the same team.
I don't want it to feel like

35:36.760 --> 35:38.876
I'm infringing on your territory.
I just...

35:39.054 --> 35:40.761
I really think we have something
with these Oodies.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.217
We don't talk business
when I'm fishing, son.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.678
When I'm about to cast.
Don't get hooked!

35:48.313 --> 35:52.773
We can, however, talk all
about it tomorrow at my office.

35:52.942 --> 35:56.025
It don't excite me that some
Yankee's come down here

35:56.196 --> 35:58.358
imposing his authority
on one of my best friends.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.737
This county has the lowest crime rate
in the state, last time I checked.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.276
I know you Democrats

36:04.454 --> 36:05.865
think we need your help,

36:06.039 --> 36:10.579
but I'm here to tell you that we don't.
Bad enough I've gotta fight you in D.C.

36:10.752 --> 36:14.791
Now you can just ease your way out
of here the same way you eased in.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.956
I'd like to enjoy what's left
of my afternoon.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.882
Alrighty, then.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.051
Why don't you go back home
to that wife of yours?

36:29.229 --> 36:32.893
It must be hard raising
a baby all by herself.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.979
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

37:20.864 --> 37:25.108
- Pretty classy joint you've got here.
- Thanks. Nice shirt.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.782
- You Lucky?
- That's right.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.951
Let's see about that.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.336
Hey, man, why don't you
turn that shit off back there for me?

37:38.506 --> 37:41.919
That's Mac. He's 98 years old.
I think he's earned the right

37:42.093 --> 37:44.300
to watch a little T and A if he wants.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.838
Why? He ain't jerking nothing.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.302
Yeah, well, he's been watching that
stuff since I opened the joint,

37:49.476 --> 37:52.309
so I'm gonna keep it that way,
all right?

37:52.479 --> 37:54.436
Well, how about this?

37:54.606 --> 37:59.772
If I go back there, I'm gonna bust
up Mac and your TV. How about that?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.652
Yeah, is that a fact?

38:07.202 --> 38:09.739
- What the fuck?
- See, I got a minor with me.

38:09.913 --> 38:13.201
I'd appreciate it if he wouldn't
have to listen to that.

38:18.922 --> 38:22.005
Hey, Mac, I'm gonna give it
a rest for a second, all right?

38:23.051 --> 38:24.837
<i>I'm looking for
a friend of mine. Terry.</i>

38:25.011 --> 38:26.001
Macky?

38:30.099 --> 38:32.215
I'm gonna give it a rest!

38:33.645 --> 38:35.227
Mac.

38:35.396 --> 38:39.731
Say, Mac. Mac'?

38:41.319 --> 38:43.356
It looks like Mac finally
had enough.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.646
Hey, man.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.410
<i>Let me guess.
This is the part where you say</i>

38:52.580 --> 38:55.789
<i>you'll be back. Am I right?</i>

38:57.085 --> 38:59.497
<i>I'll be back.</i>

39:04.050 --> 39:06.041
You know this movie?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.680
<i>I'll be back.</i>

39:27.949 --> 39:29.610
<i>I'll be back.</i>

39:34.539 --> 39:37.281
Well, ain't you full of surprises?

39:59.397 --> 40:03.482
Hey, this is Lucky. Yeah, listen,
I need an ambulance down here, OK?

40:03.651 --> 40:06.359
It seems like Mac's passed on, OK?

40:09.282 --> 40:13.822
You got anything to eat back there
besides the bar food bullshit?

40:13.995 --> 40:18.239
- I have to go get it.
- Well, rustle something up, man.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.158
I need something for the kid, please.
We're in a big hurry if you don't mind.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.247
Yeah'? You running from something'?

40:30.511 --> 40:32.343
Goddamn.

40:48.863 --> 40:52.822
How's it going, ladies?
Need something to drink?

40:52.992 --> 40:55.484
Don't know what we'd like yet.

40:55.662 --> 40:58.780
All right. Well,
you let us know when you do.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.618
Looking real good up in here.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.792
Watch this.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.141
Dibs.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.197
Name's McQueen.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.903
What's your name?

41:39.080 --> 41:40.536
Can I buy you a drink'?

41:40.707 --> 41:44.371
Her name is Jez.
And you can buy us a drink.

41:44.544 --> 41:50.290
Lucky? Can I get us some beers
for my new friend Jez.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.800
And her ladies. And that kid's
still waiting on his food.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.881
I'll be right back.

42:00.059 --> 42:02.221
Figure it out.

42:06.566 --> 42:10.275
What's your story?
And I'm gonna pretend I'm listening.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.607
Damn bullshit!
Don't want the kid seeing porn,

42:12.780 --> 42:16.193
but when some sweet tail walks in,
they forget all about that, right?

42:16.367 --> 42:21.362
First time in four years I got
some sweet, fresh snapper come in here,

42:21.539 --> 42:24.952
and I'm down here making fucking
sandwiches for the Road Warriors?

42:25.126 --> 42:26.582
Kiss my fucking ass!

42:40.600 --> 42:41.715
Wanna dance?

42:43.186 --> 42:45.143
About damn time.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.725
Not like that.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.025
Not like that either.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.489
Brick?

43:05.666 --> 43:07.703
<i>Is that the Big Whopper
or the Ponytail?</i>

43:07.877 --> 43:10.289
<i>By the way, Marty says hi.</i>

43:10.463 --> 43:13.922
Yeah? Well, tell Marty, "Fuck you."
I see you dodged another bullet.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.457
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

43:15.635 --> 43:19.173
These days, baby,
I can get just about anything I want to.

43:19.347 --> 43:23.341
For instance, right now I'm
getting back my paycheck on wheels

43:23.518 --> 43:27.682
<i>- from those amateurs you sent.
- Moneygrubbing piece of shit!</i>

43:27.855 --> 43:30.142
What happened to us, baby?
We were good once, weren't we?

43:30.316 --> 43:33.650
Fuck you! We were never good.
I got played and that's that.

43:33.820 --> 43:38.530
Hang on a second.
Anybody got played, it was me.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.657
I thought I had a bitch
that was down with this shit.

43:41.828 --> 43:43.785
<i>You killed his parents, you psycho!</i>

43:43.955 --> 43:46.447
And it makes me sick that
I brought you into their world!

43:46.624 --> 43:48.831
Don't you think they're just
a bad judge of character?

43:49.001 --> 43:50.992
It ain't my fault all your
friends are richer than shit.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.538
<i>And you know something? At the end
of the day, I think you knew.</i>

43:54.715 --> 43:57.753
If I knew, I would have lit your
gutless ass on fire while you slept!

43:57.927 --> 44:00.919
Now, there's
the feisty bitch I know!

44:01.097 --> 44:03.930
I wish it hadn't
ended up the way it did.

44:04.100 --> 44:08.344
But what's Clyde gonna do
if Bonnie crosses him and goes soft?

44:09.647 --> 44:11.979
And besides, what does that
son of a bitch need money for'?

44:12.150 --> 44:14.608
I mean, how much can a wheelchair cost?
Two or three hundred dollars?

44:14.777 --> 44:18.395
You lost, motherfucker!
Rob's coming back with me. Deal with it.

44:19.866 --> 44:24.201
Now, girlie, obviously you
didn't learn the first time around.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.782
Let me tell you
how this shit's gonna end.

44:28.291 --> 44:31.784
<i>I sent some really awful bitches
to handle this situation.</i>

44:31.961 --> 44:34.874
<i>Now, once they track down your fellas,
it's not gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

44:35.047 --> 44:38.130
<i>It's gonna get fucking sexy.</i>

44:42.305 --> 44:46.094
<i>They'll single them out,
divide them up, then thin the herd.</i>

45:31.604 --> 45:33.595
<i>Each one will have
forgotten about everything,</i>

45:33.773 --> 45:36.481
<i>except for the fine piece
of strange grinding on them.</i>

45:56.128 --> 45:59.246
<i>Then, without warning,
their lives will be snuffed out</i>

45:59.423 --> 46:04.338
<i>and the girls deliver Rob just in time
for me to plan the boy's 18th birthday.</i>

46:04.512 --> 46:06.423
<i>You should have stayed dead, darling.</i>

46:06.597 --> 46:10.636
<i>'Cause unless your name is Jesus,
you had no business coming back.</i>

46:10.810 --> 46:12.676
See <i>you soon.</i>

46:56.689 --> 46:58.020
Why don't you try a taste of me?

47:17.918 --> 47:21.206
Well, hi, big guy.
Here's my boom stick.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.294
Shit!

47:39.106 --> 47:43.976
Hey! Hey, don't be
fucking around up there!

48:15.684 --> 48:17.220
Fuck!

48:26.904 --> 48:31.193
Well, those girls were the longest
relationship I ever had.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.365
You OK, bud?

48:40.835 --> 48:43.202
All right, come on.
I wanna move. Let's go.

48:46.841 --> 48:50.960
Lucky's about to get lucky
up in this motherfucker.

48:51.137 --> 48:54.095
Do this shit right.
I'm gonna do it all night.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.256
I've got to pay to play...

48:56.434 --> 48:59.802
Five girls like that come in there,
you've got to pay to play.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.265
That pussy ain't free.

49:01.439 --> 49:03.640
Don't you laugh at me.
I'm gonna make you work all this,

49:03.774 --> 49:05.606
all this extra weight off me,
because all I've been doing

49:05.776 --> 49:09.440
is eating fried chicken, baby,
and fried collards!

49:09.613 --> 49:13.948
Fried! Everything fried!
I saw a man fry a Twinkie yesterday.

49:14.118 --> 49:18.077
<i>Hill County officials
have these renderings to go on.</i>

49:18.247 --> 49:20.113
Baby, let me call you right back.

49:20.291 --> 49:21.781
<i>The assailants are travelling
with a minor,</i>

49:21.959 --> 49:25.042
<i>and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone</i>

49:25.212 --> 49:28.170
<i>fitting this description,
please contact the local authorities.</i>

49:28.340 --> 49:30.923
<i>- I'll be a motherfucker.
- Back to you with the weather, Bob.</i>

49:33.637 --> 49:36.720
That sexy bitch broke
her damn heel off in my back.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.261
- What in the hell was that?
- I don't know.

49:42.438 --> 49:45.647
But you can bet I'm gonna
call Celeste and find out.

49:51.238 --> 49:53.229
Rambo time.

50:13.802 --> 50:16.510
Now, you ain't gonna
get me back for this later?

50:16.680 --> 50:18.341
Promise me now.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.808
'Cause I've got a feeling
this is gonna hurt.

50:23.938 --> 50:28.102
- He's taking it, man.
- Take it like Drago!

50:28.275 --> 50:29.640
Drago.

50:29.818 --> 50:34.654
Drago! Drago! Drago! Drago!

50:38.202 --> 50:42.241
- Yeah, baby!
- Man! She got you good!

50:48.337 --> 50:52.581
<i>Hill County officials
have these renderings to go on.</i>

50:52.758 --> 50:55.750
<i>Eyewitness accounts say the assailants
are travelling with a minor</i>

50:55.928 --> 50:59.216
<i>and appear to be highly dangerous.
If you see anyone</i>

50:59.390 --> 51:02.724
<i>- fitting this description, please...
- Fuck me!</i>

51:09.024 --> 51:10.059
Hey!

51:10.859 --> 51:14.727
They did a really good job, didn't they?
It looks just like them too.

51:14.905 --> 51:17.522
Look at that.
It was all over the news.

51:18.576 --> 51:21.193
Sheriff, this is the first time
that evidence

51:21.370 --> 51:24.579
has literally been
brought to my doorstep.

51:25.374 --> 51:29.117
We were able to pick up
an address for them, too.

51:29.295 --> 51:31.536
I'll have a search and seizure
here by noon.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.751
And surprise, surprise!

51:33.924 --> 51:36.256
It's located on a piece
of residential land

51:36.427 --> 51:40.671
here in your county, Sheriff.
Can you believe that?

51:40.848 --> 51:43.761
That sounds like a hell of a plan, son.
What can I do to help?

51:43.934 --> 51:47.643
Well, I'm guessing half the roads that
get me there won't show up on my GPS.

51:47.813 --> 51:51.932
So if you could do me a favor
and simply escort me to the property,

51:52.109 --> 51:55.602
that would be fantastic.

51:57.448 --> 52:01.988
You mean that old-ass
condemned shack out on Euleton?

52:02.161 --> 52:06.246
Son, you didn't hear? Fire chief let the
volunteers burn that up for training.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.782
- Burn it up for training.
- Yeah.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.952
Yeah, I think it was scheduled
for early this morning.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.087
Is that right?

52:16.717 --> 52:19.438
- Well, I suggest you better stop them.
- I could call Chief Walters,

52:19.553 --> 52:22.466
but I'm pretty sure ain't nothing
left out there but smoke and ash.

52:22.640 --> 52:26.178
My! I'm really sorry about that.

52:26.352 --> 52:28.969
It really sounded like you had
something there.

52:32.858 --> 52:36.817
Motherfucker,
I'm done with you wasting my time.

52:36.987 --> 52:39.604
I don't ever remember asking for it.

52:39.782 --> 52:41.944
This good-old-boy justice thing
you got going on,

52:42.117 --> 52:45.200
letting the trash take out the trash,
saving tax dollars

52:45.371 --> 52:47.783
by keeping the bottom feeders
out of the system

52:47.956 --> 52:51.199
so you can just go fishing all day,

52:51.377 --> 52:53.459
that's a slippery slope
you're playing on.

52:53.629 --> 52:56.429
It's gotten to the point where
you're no better than they are, Sheriff.

52:57.633 --> 53:00.125
Yeah, I'd be careful if I was you.

53:02.304 --> 53:05.968
Well, I'll take
that under advisement.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.513
Shit.

53:41.885 --> 53:43.967
Wake up.

53:44.138 --> 53:47.756
Go get Rob something to eat.
I'm gonna call Celeste.

54:07.369 --> 54:10.828
Found the mother lode, boy!

54:20.549 --> 54:24.213
I'm gonna pay for it.
Don't worry. God.

54:30.642 --> 54:34.931
You see, man, when you
open up something in the store...

54:36.648 --> 54:38.980
you have to pay for it.

54:43.989 --> 54:47.527
No one taught me that
when I was young.

54:49.161 --> 54:51.778
I learnt that one the hard way.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.946
From the cops.

54:58.170 --> 54:59.786
What?

55:03.675 --> 55:05.006
What's wrong, man'?

55:05.761 --> 55:08.503
I don't know you mean
by all that squirming.

55:08.680 --> 55:12.389
Help me out, bud. What you need?
What you need?

55:14.186 --> 55:16.018
You got to take a piss'?

55:18.357 --> 55:21.065
You're hungry. Goddamn,
of course you're hungry!

55:21.235 --> 55:26.401
Let's get you something to eat?
OK. Let's go.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.484
Man!

55:30.244 --> 55:32.906
It's like working out a riddle
every time talking to this boy.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.287
Morning, sunshine! You know,

55:35.457 --> 55:38.415
I don't remember crazy-ass biker chicks
being involved in our deal.

55:38.585 --> 55:42.374
I don't remember leaving Carlos alive
in the deal either. Ls Rob all right?

55:42.548 --> 55:44.334
Fuck!

55:45.843 --> 55:47.800
Yeah, he's probably scared
half to death, but he's fine.

55:47.970 --> 55:50.330
- Let me talk to him.
- He's inside getting something to eat

55:50.347 --> 55:52.054
with McQueen. Besides,
you and I got something to talk about.

55:52.224 --> 55:53.984
<i>All right? What the hell
was that last night?</i>

55:54.101 --> 55:57.685
I told you, Carlos would try to get
Rob back if you didn't kill him.

55:57.855 --> 56:00.472
<i>What are you talking about? We killed
every motherfucker in that place.</i>

56:00.649 --> 56:03.232
Well, evidently not, Brick!

56:03.402 --> 56:05.564
All right. Why would a guy like
Carlos, what would he want to do

56:05.737 --> 56:08.149
<i>with a kid in Rob's condition?</i>

56:08.323 --> 56:12.942
Carlos killed Rob's parents,
and then lied to me about it.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.703
<i>That might have been something
you wanted to mention.</i>

56:15.873 --> 56:17.705
All right, look. I'm sorry.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.959
Rob has a trust
that matures when he's 18,

56:22.129 --> 56:26.839
and as legal guardians, we would
get him and eventually the money.

56:27.009 --> 56:31.253
That too might be something that
you wanted to mention! Fuck!

56:31.430 --> 56:36.175
Rob's trust matures next week and...
Carlos will do anything to get it.

56:36.351 --> 56:39.889
- Brick, you're all he's got.
- All right. New plan.

56:40.063 --> 56:44.022
- You meet us halfway.
- Fine. Where?

56:45.319 --> 56:47.936
Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Big Bayou Campground.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.647
I'll be there as soon <i>as</i> I can.

56:51.825 --> 56:56.410
And if you lie to me again,
Carlos will be the least of your worries.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.572
I already dropped five bitches.
I won't hesitate to make it six.

57:07.925 --> 57:11.964
Now, you may have heard
of pig in a blanket,

57:12.137 --> 57:14.595
but this here is a pig in the sun.

57:19.478 --> 57:23.346
You want hair on your chest,
now, don't you'? Strippers like it.

57:25.025 --> 57:26.436
Hand me a napkin, man.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.197
You all right'?

57:37.913 --> 57:40.280
Hey. Don't worry.

57:40.457 --> 57:44.701
Don't worry, man.
Ain't nothing will hurt Lincoln.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.494
He's OK.

57:48.048 --> 57:49.914
<i>Believed to be
responsible for the shooting</i>

57:50.092 --> 57:51.298
<i>in a rural Texas bar.</i>

57:51.468 --> 57:54.130
<i>They are travelling with a disabled
young man and believed to be</i>

57:54.304 --> 57:58.719
<i>armed and dangerous. Do not
approach these men if you see them.</i>

58:08.276 --> 58:10.392
Who wants a Snicker bomb?

58:12.531 --> 58:15.649
Think you can kidnap
some kid and get away with it'?

58:20.038 --> 58:23.201
Yeah, well, I guess if you do the math,
five whore <i>assassins</i>

58:23.375 --> 58:25.867
can't trump three retards
and a fucking cripple.

58:26.044 --> 58:28.627
I mean, well,
according to my calculations,

58:28.797 --> 58:30.879
they should be in your
area someplace by now.

58:31.049 --> 58:33.211
But that's not my fucking job
to figure out, is it?

58:33.385 --> 58:36.377
I mean, isn't owning
the road your goddamn job?

58:36.555 --> 58:38.671
That's what I thought. OK.

58:38.849 --> 58:41.432
Anyway, I don't give a shit what you do.
Just get my boy back.

58:42.227 --> 58:43.592
Yes! Get it done!

58:50.110 --> 58:53.569
- Yeah?
- We're in a world of shit down here.

58:53.739 --> 58:55.446
Yeah, and now it's
spilling over into mine.

58:55.615 --> 58:58.323
Listen, we're going to Vicksburg,
Mississippi. OK?

58:58.493 --> 59:02.657
- Big Bayou Campground. We could...
- Stop. Stop! Shut up!

59:02.831 --> 59:05.198
Just shut the fuck up!
The less I know, the better.

59:05.375 --> 59:08.788
- I taught you better than this!
- Look, I just thought that if,

59:08.962 --> 59:10.669
you know,
we could run in and do a quick...

59:10.839 --> 59:15.379
Don't do that! Don't get ideas!
Just do what the fuck I say!

59:15.552 --> 59:17.793
Things ran smooth when we did that,
didn't it?

59:18.513 --> 59:20.720
<i>I cleaned up your shit,
you took care of mine.</i>

59:20.891 --> 59:22.973
I could have handled this hotshot.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.726
But now this shit has gone public.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.638
There's repercussions
to working for yourself.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.898
- About time you learned that.
- Meaning what?

59:32.069 --> 59:35.983
<i>I got to cut ties, Brick.
I cleaned up everything on my end.</i>

59:36.156 --> 59:39.114
<i>So, what you do from now on
rests solely on your shoulders.</i>

59:39.284 --> 59:43.278
<i>If you come back here,
I got no choice but to put you down.</i>

59:44.581 --> 59:46.071
I got a family to protect.

59:50.629 --> 59:53.917
I'll be sure to let the boys know
that we're on our own again.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.082
Talk to you later, Sheriff.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:05.637
Brick! We gots to go!

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.768
We made the news!

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:22.074
Hood Pirates! Mount up!

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.301
Give me that!

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:53.434
- You call Millard?
- Yeah.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.104
Well, what did he say'?

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.998
<i>The suspects
in question are believed to be.</i>

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:01.447
<i>- Brick Oodie and his two brothers...
- Nothing.</i>

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.904
<i>They hail from the Atmore area,
located in Montgomery, Alabama.</i>

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.116
They drew you to look like a fag.
Look at that.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.248
What the fuck you do that for, man?

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.423
- What the fuck, man?
- Come on! Come on?

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:21.629
- What are you do...?
- Come on!

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:23.464
I ain't gonna fucking hurt you,
you little faggot!

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:26.130
- Stop, man!
- Come on! Come here!

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.719
Want some? You want some?

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:31.261
- Fuck!
- What the devil got into you'?

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:36.348
I fucked us.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.736
How you mean?

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:46.197
Let's see. Millard won't have
anything to do with us any more

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:49.657
'cause he can't clean up that mess
with the biker chicks down at the bar.

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:52.539
So now we can't go back to 'Bama.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.701
And all of them son of bitches
we mowed down in Austin?

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.962
- Guess what we missed.
- Carlos.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.880
And he ain't gonna stop neither.
He's already tracked down Celeste.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:08.218
So now we gotta get him to fucking
Vicksburg so they can disappear.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.092
Well...

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.806
This is getting better by the minute.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.019
Now, I like that little fella
just as much <i>as</i> anybody.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:28.739
But tell me something. Just give me one
reason why we shouldn't bail right now.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.825
They ain't got no other options.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.161
Hell, we ain't got
no other options either.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:40.838
I mean, look at us.
We can't even take care of ourselves.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:43.627
Has it ever crossed your mind

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:47.086
that maybe he stands
a better chance without us?

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.886
- It's just different.
- How's this different?

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.552
- It's just different!
- How the fuck is it different?

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.558
We had a brother...

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.854
who passed away
before you can even remember.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.236
He was in the same situation Rob's in.

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:08.240
He was all buggered up,
and he was in a wheelchair.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.779
Daddy beat his ass every single day.
Treated him like a dog.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:17.826
And there's nothing
we could do about it. Different.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.463
Well, he gets a pass. I don't
understand why you didn't say nothing.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.224
- How come you never said nothing?
- What do you want me to say to you?

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.431
I'm sorry, all right?

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.848
But ever since I've seen this fella,
I can't stop thinking about it.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.358
How'd he die?

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.529
- How'd he die?
- I don't know.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.867
He was there one day and gone the next.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:01.501
I asked Daddy about it one time,
but that went over like a fart in church.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.843
What was his name?

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.770
- They never named him.
- Fuck me.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:47.210
Got them bitches! Dead ahead!

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:57.220
And this time, try not to hit
the motherfucking baby.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:02.892
Here they come!

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.433
I'm giving it all she's got.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.944
Monaco ain't got nothing left!
Strap in Rob! Here they come, boys!

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:11.105
What the hell is this motherfucker?

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.951
Hey, Rottweiler!
You better back the fuck up, mutt!

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.998
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.461
The kid's in the back!

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:51.604
They took the kid!
I thought I told you to strap him in!

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.621
They took the fucking door, man!
I really don't think a fucking seatbelt

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.567
would have mattered right now! Go!

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.295
- Hey, he all right?
- How in the fuck do I know?

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:10.751
Here they come! Just like you said!

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:16.465
Hey! Help the driver.
You want to see this.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.971
We're about to fuck
your babysitters up.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.733
- Come on, boy!
- Come on!

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.151
Welcome to the South, motherfuckers!

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:43.330
What you got now, bitches'?!

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:46.874
Time out, bitch!

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:08.021
No. No, indeed. Hell no.

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:10.307
- Do something, you're the brains!
- We've gotta figure something out!

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.101
What?!

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.528
- Top rope!
- Top rope!

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.579
Motherfuckers!

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.915
Get them, Lincoln! Come on!

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.427
Go get 'em!

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.558
They're slowing down!
They're slowing down!

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:49.475
Come on.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.273
Lincoln!

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.045
We're good!

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.256
You all right, buddy'?

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.225
You're one crazy redneck.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:39.854
Trying to be a tough guy'?
Running away from us?

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.152
You want one of these?
You've earned it.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:49.823
- How's Linc?
- Not so good.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.832
- What?
- You better check on him.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:53.913
You got Rob'?

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.124
Fuck.

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:06.424
You do all this?

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.514
By God.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:15.394
It ain't your hat, bitch.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:19.361
Good work!

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:21.770
Let me take a look.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:23.939
Come on. Let me see it.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:29.286
Shit!

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.741
Well, I think it's safe to say that,

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:37.082
that surpasses McQueen's
level of doctoring.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.631
<i>- Fine.
- You are not fine.</i>

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.214
We need to get that looked at.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:46.426
- Fine.
- All right. You're fine.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.550
Fine, my <i>ass.</i>

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:56.940
Fuck!

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:09.240
McQueen!

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:26.177
Montane! Montane,
where the fuck are you'?

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:30.848
Shit.

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:43.149
Goddamn it!

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.193
Hey, you guys need a ride?

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.956
Who are these fucking people?!

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.921
Nah, man. We're good.
Just keep going.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.344
Son of a bitch.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:12.553
He practically made these monsters,
then hung them out to dry.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.264
You gotta be kidding me.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.355
And why aren't they working for me'?!

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:25.654
Just get in the car.
I'm a nurse. I can help.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.359
That ain't such a bad idea.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:30.988
Bingo.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.996
What happened here?

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:39.496
- I did that.
- The stabbing or the stitches'?

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:43.288
- The stitches.
- Infection is setting in.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.174
I poured whiskey on it.

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.255
Let me guess,
you saw that in a movie'?

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.091
Yeah. Several.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:05.652
Hey-Hey, Rob?

01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:10.149
You hold onto that, all right'?
You know that's his prize possession.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.660
He's gonna need it when
he gets to feeling better, OK?

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:22.202
<i>Chogan, this is Carlos.
I'm only calling as a last damn resort.</i>

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.792
<i>Some asshole took Rob
and I need you to kill him.</i>

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:27.326
<i>If you can, bring me back the kid,
and if not, then fuck it.</i>

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.584
<i>If I can't have him, nobody can.</i>

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.385
They're close.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.345
Finish up!

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:50.943
He gonna be all right?

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:54.451
Like I said, it's up to you.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.329
You look really familiar.

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:05.586
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.748
Do you stay in shitty motels?
'Cause we clean them.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:13.758
Crockett.
That's where I've seen you.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.973
Small world.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.434
So why ain't you a nurse?

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:25.899
- Hospitals don't exactly hire illegals.
- Why don't you become legal?

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.776
Your country doesn't
make it that easy for us.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.067
What are you talking about'?

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.773
Just go down to the place
and fill out your paperwork.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.784
Shit. Tell them you want to be legal.
I mean, you speak the language.

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.821
That's more than most
of them do out here.

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:42.115
Your ignorance is unbelievable.

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:46.411
Yeah, well, I might
be just an ignorant redneck,

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.876
but at least I know who I am.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:54.052
I mean, you're a nurse.
You ought to be helping people.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:56.337
Not scrubbing toilets.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:02.352
Well, is that why you do what you do?
'Cause it's who you are?

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:08.726
Let's just say it runs in the family.
You know?

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:13.647
Well, you're not gonna have
much family left at this pace.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.540
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.873
I can't say that I'd exactly
done the same thing, so...

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.002
You're welcome.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:38.255
What would you say if...
if I offered you two grand

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.014
to get us to Vicksburg, Mississippi'?

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:48.231
What do you say I convince you not
to do what you're about to do?

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.689
I could take you anywhere else.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:58.492
Nah. This here's one of them
kind of deals, you know?

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:06.666
We kind of had people controlling
what we do our whole lives, you know?

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.999
It's time for us to take it by the reins.

01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:04.136
- Please keep the kid safe for me.
- Nothing bad's gonna happen.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:08.599
- We've just got a job to finish.
- I'm foreign. I'm not stupid.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:15.442
- Thank you.
- See ya.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.571
See you around.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.917
Can we still put a pool in
with three grand?

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:35.629
What you thinking'?

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.044
I was thinking Whac-A-Mole.

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:43.133
But it's gonna be tough
with just two of us.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.717
What you mean two'?

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:56.771
That's fitting.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:05.485
- You want to go high?
- No.

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:19.586
You go and run in the house.

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:25.555
No matter what you hear,
no matter what the people say,

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:30.218
Papaw did what he could to make things
better for you than he had. OK?

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.512
Go. Run along.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:43.319
Dispatch told me you'd...
you'd be here.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:47.326
Yeah. I'd offer you some sweet tea,
but I like it stout enough to kill a mule.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.329
It might be too strong for you.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:58.080
You know, of all
the Southern idioms and charms,

01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:02.091
you know which one
I find the most helpful?

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.002
My extraordinary hospitality'?

01:18:06.307 --> 01:18:09.516
<i>The fact that nobody
ever throws anything away.</i>

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.386
I've got to hand it to you, Sheriff.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:19.310
There was nothing in any database
that ever connected you to them.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:24.363
<i>Wasn't no computer
files back in the day.</i>

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.446
<i>Another perk of Alabama
being behind the times.</i>

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.327
<i>Paper trail easy as hell
to get rid of.</i>

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:33.031
Only thing this proves is that
a young deputy was doing his job.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:36.834
Right, right, right.
Well, I figured you'd say that,

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:43.046
so I did a little further digging,
and I found this.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.880
You missed some paper, Henry.

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:50.632
You signed for $1,200 dollars
on May 26th, '05,

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.141
$800 June 15th, 'O7,

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:55.895
$1,100 on February 3rd, '08.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:58.147
And it goes on and on and on.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:01.400
<i>That money was issued
for crime scene clean up.</i>

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.983
<i>And I can hire anybody
I damn well please.</i>

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:08.900
Well, since when do people get paid
to clean up a crime before it happens?

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.661
<i>You are right though, Sheriff.</i>

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:18.622
<i>You've got the lowest
crime rate in the state.</i>

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:23.464
You certainly weren't paying
them much though, were you'?

01:19:23.634 --> 01:19:26.467
It's no wonder
those dogs turned on you.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:33.012
<i>Now, listen. This story,
you know, could end one of two ways.</i>

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.722
<i>You could either help me out,
cooperate...</i>

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:39.268
or I could just arrest you
on the spot.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.729
Take them down myself, eventually.

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:44.823
Look, either way,
I've got to take you to prison,

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:50.909
but you play nice, I'll see to it
that your sentence is shortened.

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:54.446
Maybe one day you'll be able to see your
granddaughter graduate from high school.

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:10.924
Let's consider it
a professional courtesy.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:15.091
They get big quick on you.

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.936
You'll find that out sooner or later.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:28.233
- Come with me.
- No, no, no. Come on.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:30.694
- I don't think so.
- Cut that shit out.

01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:33.200
Fighting's a young man's game.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:40.954
- Where are you going?
- Vicksburg.

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:44.541
If anybody's gonna put an end to this,
it's going to be me.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:49.842
You know, I'm the one that ain't
supposed to be trusting you.

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:52.219
Y'all won the damn war.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:04.566
Now this is the same face paint
that Lincoln used when he wrestled.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.937
Solidifies you as one of us.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:16.364
You scared?

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:21.369
You're an Oodie now.
You got to swallow that fear.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.042
For what it's worth,

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.713
I think you deserve more
than what you've been through.

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:38.053
It ain't right,
people taking advantage of you

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.185
just because you can't help yourself.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:47.817
I know you may not have had a lot of
people in your life you can look up to.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:53.899
Hell, I ain't telling you
to look up to us.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:01.698
I just want you to know that we're
going to do everything we can

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.240
to keep you from getting hurt.

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.927
I'm gonna leave you in charge.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:18.006
My new lookout.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.389
You've been promoted.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.626
Empty...

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:06.770
- That ain't much.
- It's gonna have to do.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.192
Lincoln don't look so good.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:21.156
Yeah, he's been better.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:25.164
Hey.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:29.828
You think she's gonna come
and see this thing through?

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.837
Or is she just gonna run
for the hills?

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:35.424
I reckon we're about to find out, ain't we?

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.427
Yeah.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:49.355
Why you reckon God
would make someone like him?

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:53.063
What?

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.647
Why would God let something
be wrong with him like that?

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:07.658
I don't know. Hell, man, I don't know.

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:14.546
Hell, why you asking me that, man?

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:19.343
I don't know.
Just been thinking about it.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:25.516
I don't ask
why God made men like him.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:30.847
I wonder why he made men like us.

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:06.845
How are the boys'?

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.064
All right.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.192
Hey, Brick?

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.735
I'm starting to think we should
have finished school.

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:24.988
At least junior high.

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:48.344
It's almost over, bud.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:12.532
- Shit!
- McQueen!

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.124
A fucking arrow, man? Fuck!

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.602
Come on!

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:39.692
Go!

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:41.226
Move your ass, woman!

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.863
- Shit.
- Where's Rob, Brick?

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.577
He's safe!

01:26:57.838 --> 01:26:59.598
Stay right here.
I've gotta go get some ammo.

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:00.692
- No! I'm going with you.
- Stay here!

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:03.208
- I'm going with you!
- Fuck!

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.175
- Come on, man!
- Go!

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:16.683
- Grab a gun. Fuck.
- Take me to fucking Rob!

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:18.268
You're keeping your ass here!

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:22.185
That was a fucking arrow, man!

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:27.864
Brick!

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:34.825
Brick!

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.083
Time out, motherfucker!
This ain't fun no more! Stop!

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.497
Fuck me! Shit.

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:05.768
I told you to fucking stay here!

01:28:05.906 --> 01:28:07.021
You're really gonna say
I told you so right now'?

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.610
You mind yourself, woman!

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.151
Shit!

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.707
God!

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:26.799
- Don't fucking move!
- Come out, come out.

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.590
What you gonna do with that?

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:34.886
- McQueen!
- Hey!

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.346
Hey! Hey!

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:57.280
You're about to have
a bad day, John Redcorn.

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.256
Remind me again who's
gonna have a bad day?

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:40.246
Ain't that a sight.

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:38.635
So... you and your brothers
kidnapped the kid from...

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:41.766
from Ms Martin, and you were
planning on holding him for ransom'?

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:46.022
- Yeah? All right.
- That's what I said.

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:49.855
And what about these other men here?
Who are they?

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:58.575
All right. All right.

01:30:58.745 --> 01:31:01.545
You'll have plenty of time to think
about your answers in prison. Yeah?

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:14.466
- Agent Reese?
- Special Agent Simmons! Hey!

01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:16.752
- Nice work.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.843
I'm very impressed
with how you navigated these waters.

01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:22.599
I'm putting in a request to have
you take over this territory.

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:25.181
- No, no, no, no, sir...
- Don't worry about the details.

01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:28.313
We'll get everything handled. Cover
the moving expenses and everything.

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:30.644
- But my wife...
- It's a fine place to raise a family.

01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:33.443
- Sir... I...
- I'm sure she'll love it.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:37.648
Fuck me.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:40.988
Hey! Fuck me!

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.117
Hey, bud!

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:52.705
I just wanted to say thank you.
I'm sorry it came down to all this.

01:31:52.882 --> 01:31:55.715
Don't mention it.

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:59.920
Just make sure
you take care of this little guy.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.306
He's one tough cuss.

01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:09.229
Sorry we didn't get the fucker.

01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:11.857
That's all right.
Carlos will get his.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:21.572
Hey, man, you think I could have
a minute? I ain't going nowhere.

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:23.486
All right.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:28.661
Hey, stop that.

01:32:32.922 --> 01:32:35.254
You're an Oodie now.

01:32:37.677 --> 01:32:41.170
Make sure this shit
didn't go down for nothing.

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:43.429
Yeah.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:50.304
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.194
Well, ain't that some E.T. shit?

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:02.778
You know Brick's gay, right?

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.949
See ya, Rob.

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:20.626
The hits just keep on coming.

01:33:28.812 --> 01:33:31.554
No matter how this thing plays out...

01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:36.316
I'm proud of you boys.

01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:50.240
You busy? Goddamn it!

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.492
Is there anything I can get you'?

01:33:57.257 --> 01:34:00.170
- What?
- I have a package for Carlos Lyman.

01:34:00.343 --> 01:34:02.050
- Please sign here.
- I ain't signing shit.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.506
- Just give me the package.
- Are you all right, sir'?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.341
Yeah, I'm fine. It's none
of your goddamn business.

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:08.007
- You have to sign.
- Isn't that great?

01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:12.473
The fucking Postal Service is
concerned with my goddamn wellbeing.

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:27.951
This better be a box
full of fucking cash.

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:34.116
You bitch!

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.229
What was that letter they gave you'?

01:35:03.406 --> 01:35:05.522
Some work release bullshit, I...

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.236
No.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:18.248
"Brick. I told you I'd settle up.
The truck's from Rob."

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:21.288
Come to find out,
more people could use your help.

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:24.959
"Check the bed and enjoy the toys.
Celeste."

01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:28.511
What truck?

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:34.551
Damn!

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:49.232
I guess somebody forgot to tell me

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.401
it was motherfucking Halloween
in the South today.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.536
That Asian one.

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:57.373
Pink eyeliner on.

01:35:57.543 --> 01:36:00.956
I've got something pink,
and I'm swinging it real low.

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:03.997
Swinging it real low.
I don't wanna hear any goddamn lip.

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:09.295
It's a fucking bar. You want some
McDonald's, go to McDonald's.

01:36:09.472 --> 01:36:10.837
Make me a sandwich!

01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:13.757
I don't give a fuck what it is
as long <i>as</i> he just get to eat.

01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:16.597
Hey, shaggy! Come on get the...

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:18.531
We're gonna walk in here
and cause some shit!

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:23.183
Get the fuck out of here,
you dumb, backwards-talking,

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.352
motherfucking
<i>Sling</i> Blade-ass motherfucker.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:28.238
If my brother was here, you wouldn't
be talking that bullshit to me.

01:36:28.408 --> 01:36:30.900
I'll fucking kill your ass
and fuck Mac.

01:36:31.077 --> 01:36:35.366
Turn that porn off for me. I don't give
a fuck! Make a sandwich for you.

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.498
Yeah, I'll be the biggest Jew-kicking,
motherfucking ass motherfucker

01:36:38.668 --> 01:36:41.376
you gonna ever see.
I ain't never seen a Jew that big!

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:45.005
What the fuck am I gonna do with
him, Chuckabee? I don't know.

01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:48.292
When was the last time you went
to the dentist, motherfucker?
