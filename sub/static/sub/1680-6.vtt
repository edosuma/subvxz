WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:03.450
it was a quiet november afternoon in 2007.

00:03.460 --> 00:04.700
i was working from home,

00:04.710 --> 00:06.920
because, you know, no distractions.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.480
-this is incredible! -oh, my god!

00:08.480 --> 00:09.550
i can't believe it!

00:09.550 --> 00:11.160
-i have big news. -oh, my god!

00:11.160 --> 00:12.330
okay, my thing's pretty huge.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.060
-but fine, you can go first. -okay, i just

00:14.060 --> 00:17.530
-found out... -i found a porno starring ted mosby!

00:17.850 --> 00:18.370
what are you...

00:18.370 --> 00:19.540
what are you, what you're talking about?

00:19.550 --> 00:23.300
i'm talking about welcome to the sex plane,

00:23.310 --> 00:25.670
and look who plays the navigator,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.800
ted mosby.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.760
it is the same exact spelling as my name.

00:30.770 --> 00:31.740
okay, you know,

00:31.750 --> 00:33.010
cute coincidence, barney.

00:33.010 --> 00:34.280
whatever.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.090
i just got off the phone with the nr...

00:36.090 --> 00:37.970
oh, my god, this totally explains the thing

00:37.970 --> 00:39.700
at my doctor's the other day.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.040
open wide.

00:41.050 --> 00:42.430
i guess you're more used to saying that

00:42.430 --> 00:45.410
than hearing it, huh, ted mosby?

00:47.660 --> 00:49.370
who is this guy?

00:49.720 --> 00:51.140
and why's my doctor watching porn?

00:51.150 --> 00:53.730
all right, let's meet your new doppelganger.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.400
or should i say doppelbanger?

00:56.410 --> 00:57.560
guys, guys, guys!

00:57.560 --> 00:59.260
can i tell my news?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.490
-it's pretty... -this is really bizarre.

01:01.490 --> 01:02.810
the only other famous mosby i know

01:02.810 --> 01:04.989
was a confederate general during the civil war.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.160
probably not the same guy.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.140
i got the job at the nrdc!

01:08.150 --> 01:10.530
you got the job! oh! yeah.

01:10.530 --> 01:13.620
the nrdc, or national resources defense council,

01:13.620 --> 01:15.800
fought for clean water,

01:15.810 --> 01:18.180
air and to preserve america's wilderness.

01:18.190 --> 01:20.010
it was marshall's dream job.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.620
-congrats, buddy! -thanks.

01:21.630 --> 01:23.230
it's kind of weird hugging with porn on.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.090
yeah, it really is.

01:25.170 --> 01:26.330
hey, hey-o!

01:26.330 --> 01:27.740
new guy entering the cockpit.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.460
could it be the navigator, ted mosby?

01:30.470 --> 01:31.620
uh... no.

01:31.630 --> 01:33.370
no, navigators have three stripes on their hats.

01:33.370 --> 01:34.690
captains have four.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.170
that guy's a captain.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.240
yeah, and i'm sure complete accuracy

01:38.240 --> 01:41.670
in all those details was very important to the directors...

01:41.680 --> 01:44.600
"dirt and skank, the raunch brothers."

01:47.760 --> 01:50.130
baby, i have some exciting news!

01:50.130 --> 01:53.730
i hope it's not that you just won some sort of race here.

01:54.390 --> 01:56.030
i got the job at the nrdc!

01:56.040 --> 01:58.440
and i found a porno starring ted mosby!

01:58.450 --> 02:00.110
oh my god, that's amazing!

02:00.110 --> 02:01.480
i know, right?

02:01.490 --> 02:03.170
oh, congratulations, marshall!

02:03.180 --> 02:04.280
congratulation to us all!

02:04.280 --> 02:05.890
oh, let's go celebrate!

02:05.890 --> 02:08.759
the fact that i found a porno starring a guy named ted mosby--

02:08.759 --> 02:10.470
let's do it!

02:10.590 --> 02:11.620
oh, is that him?

02:11.620 --> 02:14.380
cause that ted mosby really knows what he's doing.

02:14.390 --> 02:16.330
no, that's not him.

02:16.450 --> 02:17.210
what do you mean,

02:17.210 --> 02:19.430
"that" ted mosby really knows what he's doing.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.430
oh, no.

02:20.430 --> 02:22.710
no, i meant, that ted mosby,

02:22.710 --> 02:24.400
he really knows what he's doing.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.350
like all ted mosbys.

02:26.870 --> 02:27.850
wow, nrdc!

02:27.850 --> 02:29.720
way to go, marshall.

02:30.200 --> 02:30.870
but you're

02:30.870 --> 02:33.030
still gonna go to your job interview today, right, baby?

02:33.040 --> 02:33.840
marshall had an interview

02:33.840 --> 02:36.690
at a firm called nicholson, hewitt and west.

02:36.700 --> 02:37.510
they represented

02:37.510 --> 02:39.880
pretty much everybody marshall was going to sue

02:39.890 --> 02:41.550
once he started at the nrdc.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.080
i'm not doing that interview.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.810
those people are evil.

02:44.820 --> 02:47.280
marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.780
you can't just pull out at the last second.

02:49.790 --> 02:51.680
apparently you can.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.460
ted, ted, ted, guy in the hat!

02:54.460 --> 02:55.170
three stripes!

02:55.170 --> 02:58.810

03:01.250 --> 03:02.410
i know what kind of plane this is.

03:02.410 --> 03:04.800
it's a "boing."

03:05.040 --> 03:05.580
see.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.990
this is way better than marshall's internship.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.020
it's a real job.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.740

03:13.040 --> 03:14.880

03:15.970 --> 03:16.550
it's hard to tell.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.300
"i can't tell you how many nights

05:23.690 --> 05:24.680
jefferson coatsworth

05:24.680 --> 05:26.630
wasn't what i expected.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.130
marshall,

05:28.580 --> 05:30.290

05:37.010 --> 05:38.240
marshall was thrown.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.890
this guy seemed nice.

05:39.900 --> 05:40.910
of course, he wasn't.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.310

i'm innocent.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.360
marshall,

05:50.390 --> 05:51.440
why do you want to work

05:51.450 --> 05:53.510

05:56.240 --> 05:58.050
i'm sorry. stop.

05:58.060 --> 06:00.430
i can't do this with a straight face.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.460
you don't want to work here.

06:02.470 --> 06:04.040
you're only here 'cause your dad went to high school

06:04.040 --> 06:05.500
with joe hewitt.

06:05.510 --> 06:06.740
fact is,

06:06.750 --> 06:08.980
you just got a sweet job at the nrdc.

06:08.990 --> 06:11.900
and it's awesome.

06:11.910 --> 06:12.360
man, i could

06:12.360 --> 06:14.270
have gone the non-profit route.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.330
i didn't.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.180
and it eats me up inside every day.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.130
i hate myself.

06:21.510 --> 06:23.490
i hate myself.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.020

06:26.030 --> 06:28.210

06:29.280 --> 06:30.590
oh, i use it all the time.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.940
first i buy her-- and by her i mean you-- a drink.

06:33.950 --> 06:34.890
now, i'm the guy who gets her

06:34.890 --> 06:35.750
what she wants.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.000
then i pretend to care

06:37.000 --> 06:39.140
about whatever idiotic thing she cares about.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.820
for you, that would be the environment.

06:41.830 --> 06:42.680
now, i'm the great

06:42.680 --> 06:44.230
guy who shares her interests.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.620
and before you know it, you're naked in my apartment

06:46.620 --> 06:50.050
shouting, "oh, oh, bar-r-r-ne-e-ey!"

06:50.060 --> 06:50.600
and by you,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.330
i mean her.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.590
he is not trying to seduce me.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.240
he didn't even offer me the job.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.330
that comes later.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.530
at dinner.

06:58.540 --> 07:01.020

07:01.760 --> 07:03.260

07:04.470 --> 07:06.080

07:06.080 --> 07:08.230
you'll tell me all about the nrdc,

07:08.240 --> 07:10.940
and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.090
i, you know, i don't know,

07:12.090 --> 07:13.410

07:35.720 --> 07:38.170
i promised myself to the nrdc.

07:38.180 --> 07:39.490

07:39.500 --> 07:40.740
oh, you should go.

07:40.750 --> 07:41.910
i mean, you're not gonna take the job,

08:22.060 --> 08:23.940
i know we're only here to screw over my client,

08:23.940 --> 08:26.260
who quite frankly deserves it...

08:26.650 --> 08:28.530
but i gotta be able to tell the guys upstairs

08:28.530 --> 08:30.550
i gave you the spiel, okay?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.110
so, first up,

08:32.230 --> 08:33.710
starting salary.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.000
okay.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.289
here we go.

08:36.299 --> 08:39.860
this is the big number that's supposed to impress me and--

08:40.520 --> 08:43.720
that is a big number.

08:44.059 --> 08:45.610
there's also a signing bonus,

08:45.620 --> 08:47.380
uh, use of a company car,

08:47.390 --> 08:49.050
expense account, blah blah blah.

08:49.050 --> 08:52.260
hey, by the way, turn around and wave to patrick swayze.

08:56.070 --> 08:58.430
i'm going to, uh, try to remain cool.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.980
but you know patrick swayze?!

09:00.990 --> 09:01.720
he's a client.

09:01.730 --> 09:02.890
who do you think bought us this wine.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.790
crazy swayze.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
cheers, buddy.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.610
okay. no.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.410
jeff, this is all very impressive,

09:10.410 --> 09:11.960
-but i just don't think that... -listen, i know,

09:11.970 --> 09:13.370
i know.

09:13.390 --> 09:16.740
you're gonna be tempted by big numbers and fancy perks.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.520
you're gonna do the noble thing,

09:18.530 --> 09:21.030
take the low-paying job at the nrdc,

09:21.040 --> 09:22.970
live off your family money.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.600
family money?

09:24.680 --> 09:26.320
you do have family money, don't you?

09:26.330 --> 09:28.280
no, um, not that i know of.

09:28.290 --> 09:33.150
i do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.900
nrdc.

09:34.910 --> 09:37.610
no family money.

09:39.660 --> 09:41.650
so you don't plan on having kids?

09:41.660 --> 09:44.360
actually, i, i want to have four kids.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.950
new york public schools make a lot of parents nervous,

09:48.950 --> 09:53.520
but the kids who walk out, walk out proud.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.190
he was surely doing a tough decision

09:56.200 --> 09:58.110
now, kids, when i'm faced with a tough decision

09:58.120 --> 10:01.600
i like to make a list of pros and cons.

10:01.610 --> 10:03.140
marshall knew all cons

10:03.150 --> 10:04.900
but that is one thing he didn't konw

10:04.910 --> 10:07.110
a big guy live in a pros con

10:07.120 --> 10:08.760
lily, you're a kindergarten teacher.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.070
-yeah. -cause robin

10:10.070 --> 10:12.660
was about to ask lily the one question...

10:12.670 --> 10:15.660
an-and you make a kindergarten teacher's salary, right?

10:15.670 --> 10:16.580
yeah.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.620
...that lily had been dreading for years.

10:18.630 --> 10:21.500
well, how do you afford all of these expensivelothes?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.950
i shop the sales.

10:23.970 --> 10:26.500
they were in the closet when we moved in.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.170
i steal.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.530
i'm a criminal.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.560
i once shot a man just to watch him die.

10:33.190 --> 10:33.820
lily?

10:33.820 --> 10:36.130
okay.

10:36.140 --> 10:39.060
that's when lily showed robin her box of shame.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.740
lily, this is nuts.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.300
how many credit cards do you have?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.030
i don't know.

10:45.030 --> 10:46.750
well, how much do you owe?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.470
i don't know!

10:52.090 --> 10:55.500
i can't believe this many people love porn this much,

10:55.660 --> 10:58.690
including that guy who works in human resources at my firm.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.560
let's just wave at each other awkwardly.

11:01.570 --> 11:03.190
that'll make it better.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.760
dude, come on, let's just find bizarro me

11:05.760 --> 11:07.330
and get out of here.

11:07.490 --> 11:09.030
oh, i get it.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.610
ted mosby, non-porn star,

11:10.610 --> 11:13.060
thinks this is all crude and disgusting.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.010
you know wholse was considered

11:14.010 --> 11:15.470
crude and disgusting?

11:15.480 --> 11:17.030
shakespeare.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.010
hmm. but his themes--

11:18.020 --> 11:21.290
love, lust, forbidden desire-- were universal,

11:21.290 --> 11:24.320
which is why his work has stood the test of time.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.020
and so will all this.

11:26.030 --> 11:29.800
400 years from now, some high school drama class

11:29.800 --> 11:32.910
will be doing a plucky, spirited production

11:32.920 --> 11:35.560
of beef party vii.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.940
oh, my god, lily, that is a lot of debt.

11:38.950 --> 11:41.390
how did you get yourself into this situation?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.840
i don't know what it is.

11:42.850 --> 11:45.860
when i feel down about something, i shop.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.650
ma'am, is everything okay? oh,

11:48.660 --> 11:51.160
i just had a huge fight with my mother.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.600
she doesn't understand me at all.

11:55.020 --> 11:57.040
i swore that teaching would be a way

11:57.040 --> 11:58.420
to support my painting career,

11:58.420 --> 12:01.210
but i never paint anymore.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.750
i just got a huge credit card bill.

12:06.730 --> 12:07.430
does marshall know?

12:07.430 --> 12:08.630
no.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.890
but you guys are the couple

12:09.890 --> 12:11.670
who tell each other everything.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.660
and for god's sakes, lily,

12:12.660 --> 12:15.110
you text him while he's on the can.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.100
well, i just want him to know i'm rooting for him.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.980
wait, okay, this all makes sense.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.220
so when you said...

12:22.230 --> 12:23.250
but you're still going to go

12:23.250 --> 12:25.160
to your job interview today, right, baby?

12:25.170 --> 12:26.030
and then...

12:26.040 --> 12:27.180
oh, you should go.

12:27.190 --> 12:28.260
i mean, you're not going to take the job,

12:28.260 --> 12:30.740
but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.

12:30.750 --> 12:31.600
you were pushing him

12:31.600 --> 12:34.020
into taking that high- paying corporate job.

12:34.030 --> 12:34.700
i know.

12:34.700 --> 12:37.580
it's terrible that i was trying to get him to do that.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.480
terrible

12:38.490 --> 12:39.720
he has to take it

12:39.730 --> 12:42.520
i mean, how else are you going to pay off all that debt?

12:42.530 --> 12:43.060
lily, you have

12:43.060 --> 12:46.170
to tell him about this before he turns down that job.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.570
you're right.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.510
i feel awful.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.630
-you know there is a sale...-we're not going to shopping

12:59.910 --> 13:02.070
ooh, there he is. come on, let's go.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.200
why do i get so nervous around celebrities?

13:05.950 --> 13:07.660
hi, ted mosby.

13:07.730 --> 13:10.040
i'm ted mosby.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.650
ted mosby, it's you.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.620
have we met?

13:12.630 --> 13:15.260
mr. mosby, it is an honor to meet you, sir.

13:15.270 --> 13:15.940
starney binson.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.430
barney stinson.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.540
damn it.

13:18.550 --> 13:19.840
we have met.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.830
my real name is steve biel.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.310
when i was in fourth grade, you were in ninth,

13:24.410 --> 13:25.080
one day i was behind the school

13:25.180 --> 13:26.450
and a bunch of seventh graders

13:26.460 --> 13:28.530
were just beating the crap out of me.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.270
oh, yeah, i remember. that was you?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.550
yeah, but you pulled them off me.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.660
you told them to go pick on someone their own size.

13:35.950 --> 13:39.480
i vowed right then that when i made something of myself,

13:39.490 --> 13:41.540
i would honor you somehow.

13:41.550 --> 13:44.270
so you took my name and starred

13:44.280 --> 13:46.540
in welcometo the sex truck?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.770
yeah.

13:49.470 --> 13:52.250
um, yeah, listen, ted, you got to stop using my name.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.280
i-i'm trying to make a career as an architect.

13:55.290 --> 13:56.760
architect, huh?

13:56.770 --> 13:59.710
you mean like a sex architect?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.780
-what? -yeah, you know, you're on to something.

14:01.780 --> 14:04.110
that would make a great title of a film.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.470
ted mosby, sex architect.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.960
you know, i'm actually looking for a new project

14:09.960 --> 14:12.210
to shoot next friday afternoon.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.640
yeah, listen, isn't, isn't there some other way

14:14.650 --> 14:16.200
you could honor me?

14:16.210 --> 14:17.900
with all due respect.

14:17.910 --> 14:20.100
wait, you're not mad, are you?

14:20.440 --> 14:22.400
oh, man, i knew it.

14:22.410 --> 14:25.870
my father said, "just plant a tree in israel."

14:25.890 --> 14:27.260
i'm such an idiot.

14:27.270 --> 14:29.610
i guess i thought you'd be psyched.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.680
i am.

14:32.690 --> 14:33.270
i am; it's just

14:33.270 --> 14:35.510
i feel a little guilty beuse i'm not

14:35.510 --> 14:37.550
the one who saved you that day.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.620
the guy who actually saved you was...

14:40.630 --> 14:46.090
named... lance hardwood.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.110
lance hardwood, yeah.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.100
really? mm.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.940
you know, you might not know this,

14:52.950 --> 14:56.220
but in my business, that's kind of a killer name.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.110
yeah, i guess, i guess it is.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.670
i can see the poster now.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.310
lance hardwood, sex architect.

15:03.320 --> 15:03.850
starring...

15:03.850 --> 15:05.360
ted mosby.

15:05.370 --> 15:07.030
i love it.

15:08.860 --> 15:11.220
marshall and jeff stayed pretty late at the restaurant.

15:11.230 --> 15:12.070
they stayed so late

15:12.070 --> 15:14.070
that marshall crashed on jeff's couch,

15:14.080 --> 15:15.000
and the next day,

15:15.010 --> 15:17.210
marshall took part in a sunday morning

15:17.310 --> 15:19.520
tradition as old as the city itself

15:19.530 --> 15:21.250
the walk of shame,

15:21.260 --> 15:23.730
the long journey home after doing something you regret

15:23.740 --> 15:24.780
the night before.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.040
i'll take the job.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.430
that's awesome!

15:29.750 --> 15:31.640
great time last night.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.340
i'll call you later.

15:33.770 --> 15:35.620
he's not going to call you.

15:39.820 --> 15:41.570
um, did you get my message?

15:41.570 --> 15:42.960
i just, i crashed uptown. yeah, yeah.

15:42.970 --> 15:47.170
listen, i have, uh, something to tell you.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.810
uh, i have something i need to tell you also.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.760
mine's pretty huge.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.560
you go first.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.310
-well... -i took

15:55.310 --> 15:56.850
the job.

15:57.050 --> 15:57.630
i'm sorry.

15:57.630 --> 15:58.610
i'm so sorry.

15:58.610 --> 15:59.760
i was drunk,

15:59.770 --> 16:04.190
and it was a haze of cigars and scotch and swayze,

16:04.200 --> 16:06.120
and they offered me, like,

16:06.130 --> 16:09.230
like, like, like, a lot of money.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.330
oh, marshall.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.790
how much money?

16:17.420 --> 16:18.900
here.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.910
it's completely despicable.

16:27.910 --> 16:29.830
i know, i know, i sold out

16:29.830 --> 16:34.300
for a huge pile of disgusting money,

16:34.310 --> 16:38.780
disgusting money that could help our future family

16:38.790 --> 16:40.410
have some financial security

16:40.420 --> 16:42.200
and could help pay for law school.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.740
law school.

16:43.860 --> 16:46.170
law school that i went to to help protect the environment,

16:46.170 --> 16:47.330
not help destroy it.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.180
and for what?

16:48.180 --> 16:51.870
for, for... a lot of money.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.180
okay, okay, you've got to stop screaming.

16:58.190 --> 16:58.720
listen, marshall,

16:58.720 --> 17:00.850
you know what i like to do in situations like this?

17:00.860 --> 17:03.510
ted, if you say make a list of pros and cons,

17:03.510 --> 17:04.910
i'm going to smack you.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.280
i wasn't going to say that.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.020
okay, two beers,

17:08.030 --> 17:10.589
and ted, here's that yellow legal pad you asked for.

17:10.589 --> 17:12.210
yellow legal pad?

17:12.220 --> 17:13.250
i ordered fries.

17:13.250 --> 17:16.280
maybe you should use this to write down people's orders.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.550
guys, i, i don't know what to do.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.470
take the money.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.829
money is good, money is happiness.

17:25.839 --> 17:26.550
if i work there,

17:26.550 --> 17:30.030
i'll be representing the most evil corporations in the world.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.380
kind of sounds like a pro and con list to me.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.100
lily, you have to tell him.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.990
you can help him make this decision.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.930
oh, i think he's doing fine on his own.

17:39.230 --> 17:42.280
@#$%^&*@#$%^&*

17:43.780 --> 17:45.490
all right.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.510
marshall,

17:51.480 --> 17:52.760
i have something to say,

17:52.770 --> 17:54.680
and it's going to help you make your decision.

17:54.690 --> 17:58.110
oh, of course, you know my heart better than i do.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.540
before you say anything,

18:51.550 --> 18:54.830

18:55.130 --> 18:56.590
where are we going?

18:56.600 --> 18:58.560
tuckahoe funland.

18:58.900 --> 18:59.960
i'm sorry.

18:59.970 --> 19:02.250
it sounded like you said tuckahoe funland,

19:02.250 --> 19:05.100
the magic factory where dreams are made.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.600
get in.

19:11.570 --> 19:14.270
man, i-i love this place.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.860
me, too, buddy.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.120
so what did you want to tell me?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.660
i can't work for you.

19:21.730 --> 19:23.100
i know, dude.

19:23.110 --> 19:24.610
it's fine.

19:24.620 --> 19:27.390
marshall eriksen wants to preserve the environment,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.390
so that our children can enjoy it as we have.

19:29.390 --> 19:30.970
i get it.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.900
good. thank you.

19:34.380 --> 19:38.470
i look down and see children enjoying this place.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.280
yeah, because somebody fought to preserve it.

19:42.690 --> 19:45.140
if they ever shut this place down, it would be a tragedy.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.700
well, the good news is, that'll never happen.

19:48.950 --> 19:50.670
you won't let it.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.720
because when you work for us,

19:52.730 --> 19:56.420
your only client will be this place--

19:56.580 --> 19:59.010
tuckahoe funland.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.870
i'm taking the job.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.730
hey! all right.

20:04.730 --> 20:05.530
and the best part is

20:05.530 --> 20:06.520
i'm not even going to be representing

20:06.520 --> 20:07.810
some sort of evil corporation.

20:07.810 --> 20:11.390
i will be representing tuckahoe funland,

20:11.400 --> 20:13.460
the least evil place in the world.

20:13.470 --> 20:14.880
or so marshall thought.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.730
oh, i'd better check on him.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.110

20:42.120 --> 20:44.660

20:57.500 --> 21:01.320
here are the plans for the new international sex building.

21:01.620 --> 21:05.060
wow, that really looks like our apartment.

21:05.070 --> 21:05.810
it is.

21:05.820 --> 21:08.160
oh, i should return these.

21:09.230 --> 21:12.800
sex architect, you've done it again.

21:12.810 --> 21:16.050
