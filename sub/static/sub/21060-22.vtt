-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.567 --> 00:26.267
-I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:26.300 --> 00:27.833
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.867 --> 00:29.233
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.267 --> 00:30.467
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:40.900
in a court of law.

00:42.967 --> 00:45.100
-Laing: I have a lot of family
in law enforcement.

00:45.133 --> 00:48.000
My dad's a retired
detective sergeant.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.300
My uncle is a retired chief.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.533
I have cousins who are deputies,

00:52.567 --> 00:54.167
my sister's a dispatcher,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.367
sister-in-law probation officer.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.267
I have brother-in-laws
who are also police officers.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.133
Grandpa is a volunteer
at the Sheriff's Department.

01:02.167 --> 01:05.233
Uh, it's pretty safe to say
that law enforcement

01:05.267 --> 01:07.867
definitely runs
through the blood
of my family.

01:09.433 --> 01:11.867
All right, we just saw
a stolen vehicle.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.600
Where'd it go?
There it goes,
right there.

01:13.633 --> 01:16.667
-(sirens sounding)
-Charlie seven.

01:16.700 --> 01:21.833
I'm in pursuit of a 35 vehicle,
silver Kia, southbound,
Tamarind from Foothill.

01:21.867 --> 01:23.833
Stand by for the plate.

01:23.867 --> 01:29.400
-(siren continues)
-Comin' up to Arrow,
speed's 80 miles an hour.

01:29.433 --> 01:32.867
Okay, eastbound Orange
through a dead end.

01:32.900 --> 01:37.400
-(siren continues)
-(radio chatter)

01:39.067 --> 01:41.933
-All right, northbound
Lombardy to a dead end.

01:45.067 --> 01:47.633
-(screeching to a halt)

01:49.067 --> 01:50.933
-On the ground!
On the ground!

01:50.967 --> 01:54.200
Foot pursuit, northbound,
black male, black shirt--

01:54.233 --> 01:56.300
Get on the ground, dude!
Get on the ground!

01:56.333 --> 01:59.067
All right, still eastbound
through the field.

02:01.067 --> 02:02.667
-Dispatcher on radio:
Eastbound through the field.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.167
-We're about to back up
one of our partners.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.900
He was in pursuit
of a stolen vehicle.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.633
-Laing on radio:
He went out towards Dorsey!

02:07.667 --> 02:09.900
-The suspect, uh, bailed out
of the vehicle at a dead end,

02:09.933 --> 02:13.533
and he's running on foot.
We're gonna go try
to catch this guy.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.300
-Laing on radio:
Northbound, come back to Arrow.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.167
(speaks indiscernibly)

02:18.200 --> 02:20.333
-Bermudez:
We're about two blocks out.

02:20.367 --> 02:24.067
-Laing on radio:
Eastbound through the school.
Eastbound through the school.

02:24.067 --> 02:26.667
-Bermudez:
Tamarind and Arrow.

02:26.700 --> 02:29.933
-Laing on radio:
He's at Criss and Dorsey,
still eastbound!

02:29.967 --> 02:31.433
Right there!

02:31.467 --> 02:35.667
-(helicopter approaches)
-(siren wailing)

02:43.133 --> 02:44.167
-There he is!
-Hey.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.900
-Bermudez:
He's going.
-(officers shout)

02:55.067 --> 02:57.833
-Bermudez:
Comin' up behind you!
Comin' up behind you!

02:57.867 --> 02:59.667
Get your hands out!

02:59.700 --> 03:02.133
Get your hands out!
-Laing: Bring your hand back!

03:02.167 --> 03:03.300
-Bermudez:
I got his hair.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.100
Cuff him.
-Man: I can't brea--

03:05.133 --> 03:06.500
-Bermudez:
Don't move!

03:06.533 --> 03:07.633
Stop moving!

03:07.667 --> 03:09.567
-Man:
I ain't gonna move, man.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.833
(yells)

03:10.867 --> 03:14.300
-(heavy breathing)
Bring his other hand back.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.267
Code four,
one in custody.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.567
Start-- comm center
for an injured officer.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.600
What's up?

03:28.067 --> 03:29.300
You have any warrants
right now, dude?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.633
-Not at all.

03:30.667 --> 03:31.900
-No?

03:31.933 --> 03:35.933
-No warrant, man.
Pharmacy tech.

03:35.967 --> 03:36.967
-You're a pharmacy tech?
-Yeah.

03:37.067 --> 03:41.633
-Where at?
-San Joaquin, man, Ontario.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.900
-You went to school for that?
-I'm goin' to school now.

03:43.933 --> 03:48.600
-But you already got a job?
-S-- yeah, got my certificate,
workin' on my, uh--

03:48.633 --> 03:50.100
-Probably not gonna make it
to work tomorrow.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.867
-Why not?
-Cause you're goin'
to jail, bud,

03:51.900 --> 03:53.900
for evadin' the police
and possession

03:53.933 --> 03:56.533
of a stolen vehicle,
and resisting arrest.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.200
Got a whole slew of charges.

04:00.867 --> 04:02.633
-What's up, man?
Hey, thanks for catchin' him.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.067
-Yeah.
So what happened, bro?

04:04.100 --> 04:08.400
-So, we were at Foothill
and Palmetto, and I saw
that silver Kia.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.600
It's on the hot sheet--
-Yeah, the one we were
lookin' for.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.800
-Yeah, the one on the hot sheet.
I saw it turn north
and I'm like,

04:13.833 --> 04:15.367
"Hey, that's a stolen car
right there."

04:15.400 --> 04:18.533
So when he was comin' down
Tamarind, he came to Orange
right there,

04:18.567 --> 04:21.567
and I knew it was a dead end.
He tried to get around
a bunch of cars,

04:21.600 --> 04:23.333
but they kinda like
blocked him,

04:23.367 --> 04:26.433
so that's when he went east,
and I'm like, "Oh, it's gonna
be a dead end."

04:26.467 --> 04:29.633
He tried to make a turn
northbound, smashed
into a car,

04:29.667 --> 04:32.133
kinda rolled to a stop
for a sec, got out,

04:32.167 --> 04:33.600
and then foot chase was on

04:33.633 --> 04:34.733
through the backyards.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.433
-Yeah, that was solid job
on callin' it, bro,

04:36.467 --> 04:37.933
we knew exactly
where you were at.

04:37.967 --> 04:39.333
-Came right through
the school right here,

04:39.367 --> 04:41.067
and then that's when
you guys picked him up.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.500
Helicopter was right over scene,
quick, so it-- it was good.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.667
-Uh, I know, uh, Chris
jacked his finger up
pretty bad.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.200
We'll try to talk to him,
make sure he's good.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.067
-I saw that.
He had a big old scar
right there or a--

04:51.067 --> 04:53.467
-Yeah, he's gonna have
to go to the hospital,
get some stitches, probably.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.300
-Okay.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.767
One of the officers
was goin' up and over
a fence, and uh,

04:57.800 --> 05:01.267
got his hand caught
on the spikes on the top
of the fence,

05:01.300 --> 05:04.067
and, uh, ripped
a pretty good-sized portion
of his, uh, skin

05:04.067 --> 05:05.367
off of his finger.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.300
So he's probably gonna
need some stitches
and whatnot.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.667
How you feelin', bro?
-All right.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.967
-Other than some stingin' pain?
-Yeah, that's about it.

05:12.067 --> 05:15.900
Can't-- can't really feel
my finger, but-- It's just
the nerves, yeah.

05:15.933 --> 05:17.967
It took the... whole thing
right off.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.567
-Did it?
-Yeah.

05:22.267 --> 05:23.433
-Did you know
I was comin' after you

05:23.467 --> 05:25.733
when you made
that northbound turn
on Palmetto?

05:25.767 --> 05:27.700
What was-- what was
goin' through your mind
at that time?

05:27.733 --> 05:30.867
-I had to get to my son.
-You had to get to your son?

05:30.900 --> 05:33.900
-Yes, sir.
-Why would you put
all those lives in danger

05:33.933 --> 05:36.767
and drive that recklessly
to get to your son, man?

05:39.133 --> 05:42.133
That's a good way to crash,
and you won't ever get
to your son that way,

05:42.167 --> 05:43.200
you know that.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.433
You made some bad decisions
today, huh?

05:47.467 --> 05:48.867
-Little bit.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.367
-From here on out,
we're gonna make better
decisions, right?

05:51.400 --> 05:54.300
We're-- we're a grown man,
we can make good decisions

05:54.333 --> 05:55.967
between right
and wrong, correct?

05:56.067 --> 05:58.500
-Correct.
-All right, you need
to make better decisions.

05:58.533 --> 06:00.800
If not for you,
do it for your son, okay?

06:00.833 --> 06:01.933
All right, man?

06:01.967 --> 06:03.833
All right, best of luck
to you, dude, okay?

06:06.500 --> 06:10.067
The car that he TC'ed in
is that truck right back there
behind us.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.533
-Bermudez: Okay.
-Laing: He-- so--

06:11.567 --> 06:13.633
-That black truck there?
-Yeah, that black truck
with the hood up.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.667
-Okay.
-So he hit the front of that.

06:15.700 --> 06:19.333
He took the turn way too fast.
-Bermudez: Oh, crunch.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.767
Here's the deal, man.
Obviously, I ain't your dad,

06:22.800 --> 06:25.800
but I'm gonna give you
some-- some man-to-man
advice, all right?

06:25.833 --> 06:28.567
At life, we come up to many
different intersections, right?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.300
And, this is one of those
intersections for you, bro.

06:31.333 --> 06:35.367
You can keep on goin' down
the same path, which is gonna
end in-- in dead ends and jail,

06:35.400 --> 06:38.633
and maybe death.
Or you can make a U-turn now,

06:38.667 --> 06:40.167
salvage the rest
of your life.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.733
You got your whole life
ahead of you, bro.
Do some positive things,

06:42.767 --> 06:46.100
you know, be a good,
you know, productive member
of society, get married,

06:46.133 --> 06:47.600
have a family.
You say you got a baby's mama,

06:47.633 --> 06:51.133
which means you got kids.
You know, be a dad
to your children.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.300
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:52.333 --> 06:55.367
-Mm-hm.
-Y-- you have
those options, bro.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.133
But you gotta make
a decision now, at 19,

06:57.167 --> 06:59.533
bro, you gotta
make a decision to be different
for the rest of your life,

06:59.567 --> 07:01.233
you know what I'm sayin'?

07:01.267 --> 07:02.567
All right, good luck, brother.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.367
-Jones: The reason that I wanted
to become a police officer

07:07.400 --> 07:08.800
actually stemmed
from a tragic event.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.167
Back in 2011, my older brother,
Officer Brad Jones,

07:11.200 --> 07:12.733
lost his life
in the line of duty,

07:12.767 --> 07:16.133
and ever since that time,
Glendale police officers
came to our family.

07:16.167 --> 07:19.633
Felt the love
and the camaraderie
that is in law enforcement,

07:19.667 --> 07:21.667
which drew me closer
to pursue that.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.200
Ended up signin'
with Glendale Police Department,

07:24.233 --> 07:27.667
and, uh, loved every moment
of it ever since.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.667
Uh, we've just received
a call from department store.

07:31.700 --> 07:35.767
Had a subject just do
a shoplifting supposedly behind
one of the businesses here.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.600
Is that him?

07:37.633 --> 07:41.067
5-2-1, I got
a male just south of Triple A
matching the description.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.967
Looks like he just threw
a bag, he's startin'
to jog now.

07:44.067 --> 07:49.933
-(radio chatter)
-(siren sounds)

07:52.433 --> 07:56.100
-Get on the ground!
Keep your hands out
by your side!

07:57.867 --> 07:59.067
What are you runnin' from, man?

08:00.433 --> 08:02.567
-Just joggin'.
-You're just joggin'?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.933
-Yeah.
-All right, right now
you're gonna be detained, okay?

08:04.967 --> 08:06.633
'Cause you match
the description of a shoplifter.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.867
You know anything about that?

08:08.900 --> 08:11.667
5-2-1, I got one detained,
just south of the Triple A.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.167
-Yes, sir.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.633
-All right, bud,
you got any weapons on you?

08:14.667 --> 08:16.900
-No, sir.
-What did you just throw
over the fence there, man?

08:16.933 --> 08:18.233
What was in that white bag?

08:18.267 --> 08:21.067
-I didn't have a--
a white bag, sir.
-No, I watched you.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.667
What was in the white bag?
-Yeah. N-- no, sir,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.900
it wasn't a white bag.
It was my hat, sir.

08:24.933 --> 08:26.467
-You had a white hat on?
-Yes, sir.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.633
-Okay, why'd you throw
a white-- why'd you throw
your own white hat

08:28.667 --> 08:29.767
over the fence?

08:29.800 --> 08:30.867
-Because I was--

08:30.900 --> 08:33.567
I, uh, stole some stuff
from Kohl's.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.933
-'Cause you stole
some stuff from Kohl's?

08:34.967 --> 08:35.967
-Yeah, and I was...
-Okay.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.100
-...tryin' to get away, sir.

08:37.133 --> 08:38.367
-Well, I appreciate
the honesty, man.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.733
Why don't you go ahead
and stand up here?

08:39.767 --> 08:41.100
Go ahead and kick this leg out.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.400
-Which one?
-Just right here, like--

08:43.433 --> 08:45.367
Bring this knee out.
There you go. Roll over

08:45.400 --> 08:48.067
and just stay right there
for me.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.900
Where's the stuff
you stole from Kohl's man?

08:49.933 --> 08:52.133
-On the other side
of the fence over here
by-- close to where

08:52.167 --> 08:53.233
I threw my hat.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.600
-Just right where you threw
your hat?

08:54.633 --> 08:55.900
-Yes, sir.
-What all did you take, man?

08:55.933 --> 08:57.867
-Uh, two, three pairs
of pants.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.567
-Three pairs of pants.
Anything else?

08:59.600 --> 09:00.733
-That's it, sir.

09:00.767 --> 09:02.233
-Okay.
All righty.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.433
Loss prevention
just showed up, so we're
gonna stand up, buddy.

09:04.467 --> 09:07.833
-All right.
-Go ahead and stand up.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.733
All right, we're
gonna grab that stuff
in just a sec, okay?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.433
This the guy?
-Yes.

09:13.467 --> 09:16.067
-All right, man.
Well, I'm gonna have you
have a seat right here.

09:16.067 --> 09:17.500
Hey, look, cross your legs
for me, bud?

09:17.533 --> 09:19.167
-Thank you.
-Okay.

09:20.533 --> 09:23.233
What happened?
-Um, he came in, I picked up
on him already

09:23.267 --> 09:27.933
in my Under Armour department.
Selected a quick two pairs,
walked out right away,

09:27.967 --> 09:29.800
and I tried to stop him,
and he ran.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.500
-Okay.
They're blue jeans or...?

09:32.533 --> 09:36.067
-Um, there's a pair
of Levis, and then two pairs
of Under Armour pants.

09:36.067 --> 09:37.867
-Okay.
You guys desire prosecution?

09:37.900 --> 09:40.500
-Yes.
-Okay.
He's sayin' that he...

09:40.533 --> 09:42.867
threw it, so we're gonna
have an officer go check
the area, see if we

09:42.900 --> 09:44.300
can locate those items.
-Okay.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.333
-And, uh, then we'll go
from there.
-Cool.

09:46.367 --> 09:49.267
I'll meet you back over there?
-Yeah, we'll have somebody meet
you back over there, okay?

09:49.300 --> 09:50.767
-Cool. Thank you.
-Thank you. Yeah.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.167
Right now, from what I have,
you're under arrest
for shoplifting.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.367
So, uh, can you give me
a little bit more detail
about that?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.300
How come you
took the pants, man?

09:58.333 --> 10:01.567
-It's, uh--
I'm homeless.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.433
I've been trying
to get a job and...
it's, um...

10:05.467 --> 10:08.500
all my (bleep)
keeps gettin' stolen.

10:08.533 --> 10:09.767
And, uh...

10:11.067 --> 10:13.600
I was tryin' to get
this job interview

10:13.633 --> 10:18.633
to go in at Denny's.
They offered me, uh,
the opportunity for a job,

10:18.667 --> 10:23.533
but... I just need some...
decent work clothes,

10:23.567 --> 10:28.800
or just some decent clothes
to go to an interview and...

10:28.833 --> 10:32.100
to get some work and...
-Okay, so you figured
you'd get the pants,

10:32.133 --> 10:34.967
then you'd-- you'd look
better for the interview,
possibly get the job?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
-Possibly, yeah.
-All right, man.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.600
You said, uh, people
were stealin' from you?

10:39.633 --> 10:41.733
-Yeah, just, uh--
-What-- what kinda stuff
they steal from you?

10:41.767 --> 10:44.500
-Uh, everything--
you know, everything
gets stolen.

10:44.533 --> 10:45.933
All my clothes
have been stolen,

10:45.967 --> 10:48.500
and... it's just real hard,
you know, when you're homeless,

10:48.533 --> 10:52.233
you don't really have
a secure place to keep
any of your stuff,

10:52.267 --> 10:58.533
and any time you
set some stuff down,
and... you're constantly

10:58.567 --> 11:03.467
gettin' stranded and...
it's just-- it's just difficult.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.067
-Okay. I hear you, man.
It's tough when people

11:05.067 --> 11:06.300
steal stuff from you, huh?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.133
-Yeah.
-All right.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.867
Where exactly did you
throw this-- this bag,
'cause we wanna

11:10.900 --> 11:13.067
get these items
back to the store.
-It's-- it's not in a bag.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.567
I dropped 'em right over
the side of the fence.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.567
There's gonna be--
-On this-- on the side
of the fence

11:18.600 --> 11:19.667
you were runnin' on?

11:19.700 --> 11:21.267
Or joggin' on?
Or over the fence?

11:21.300 --> 11:24.533
-Uh, it'd be on the side
of the school, east
of where I threw the hat.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.633
-Okay, what do you think
the value of those pants
are, man?

11:26.667 --> 11:28.933
-About, altogether,
hundred bucks?

11:28.967 --> 11:31.300
-Hundred bucks?
-Do you have any way
of payin' for those items?

11:31.333 --> 11:33.933
-No, sir, I don't have--
I don't have anything
to my name.

11:33.967 --> 11:38.267
-Okay.
So you-- you went in the store
with the intention to shoplift?

11:38.300 --> 11:41.767
-(sighs)
Yeah. That's it.
That's correct.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.133
-All right, man.
Well, just sit tight
for us, okay?

11:44.167 --> 11:45.300
-Yes, sir.

11:47.167 --> 11:50.067
-So we're comin' up
on the location here
where the subject possibly

11:50.067 --> 11:52.600
threw over
the stolen merchandise here.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.767
So we're gonna collect
those items real quick.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.633
This looks like it's gonna be
our suspect's hat here.

11:58.867 --> 12:01.700
The merchandise is gonna be
just east of this here.

12:03.767 --> 12:07.833
Here's the... items
described by the Kohl's
loss prevention,

12:07.867 --> 12:10.900
the same description
as the suspect gave us here,

12:10.933 --> 12:12.800
right in the location
he said it would be.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.933
I'll have to take these back
to the store and give them
their property back.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.067
Hey, Joseph.
I found these along the fence
here, these are the ones

12:20.067 --> 12:21.067
you were talkin' about here?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.733
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, this is your white hat?

12:22.767 --> 12:25.500
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. And this is the, uh,
property you took?

12:25.533 --> 12:28.067
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. Did you get this

12:28.067 --> 12:30.300
from the store, too, or...
-I bought that at Goodwill.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.367
-Bought it at a Goodwill?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.933
Okay.
How come you threw it away?

12:33.967 --> 12:38.267
-Uh-- I, uh-- didn't--
it was the best thing
I could do

12:38.300 --> 12:39.900
to not fit the description.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.533
-Okay. Gotcha.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.500
All right, Joseph,
go ahead and stand up
for me, bud.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.100
All right, bud.
Go ahead and hop in there.

12:52.433 --> 12:55.800
All right, Joseph.
You know, I can appreciate you,
uh, wanting to better your life,

12:55.833 --> 12:59.167
gettin' another job.
What-- what kinda field
you lookin' to get into?

12:59.200 --> 13:03.467
-Construction.
Any-- any kind of--
any-- anything right now.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.967
Anything at all.
-Anything? Okay.
You kinda felt like,

13:07.067 --> 13:09.333
if you got the-- the better pair
of jeans, maybe some
better clothes,

13:09.367 --> 13:12.400
you'd have a better opportunity?
-Yeah. Exactly.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.967
Okay. Well, I can understand
the mentality of that.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.533
Unfortunately,
like you said earlier,

13:16.567 --> 13:19.133
when people steal
from people, it, uh--
it causes damage, okay?

13:19.167 --> 13:21.067
There's always gotta be
a victim.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.333
I understand that, uh,
at times you've been a victim,
too, but that doesn't mean

13:24.367 --> 13:27.500
that gives you the right
to make other people
victims, okay?

13:27.533 --> 13:30.667
-Mm-hm.
-Uh, you're gonna be booked
for shoplifting removal

13:30.700 --> 13:32.900
and be heading down
to the Glendale City Jail.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.733
-Schepis: Some of the things
that's good about my job

13:37.767 --> 13:40.767
besides helpin' people when, uh,
we're not answerin' 9-1-1 calls

13:40.800 --> 13:42.600
is bein' able to go out
and self-initiate things,

13:42.633 --> 13:46.933
and I take a lot
of pride in getting,
uh, illegal narcotics

13:46.967 --> 13:48.467
and, uh, weapons
off the street

13:48.500 --> 13:51.900
from, uh, folks
that aren't supposed
to have them, and it's--

13:51.933 --> 13:54.133
I think it's somethin'
that will, as a whole
will help the community

13:54.167 --> 13:55.567
that I live in.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.933
-(shouting)
-(siren blares)

13:56.967 --> 13:58.900
-Schepis: Looks like we're
gettin' flagged down right here,

13:58.933 --> 14:00.200
looks like there's
a disturbance.

14:00.233 --> 14:04.633
224. We have a disturbance
at Kinkaid and Broadway.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.567
-I found 20 bucks on the ground.
-Listen! It's okay.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.933
Just turn around,
and we'll deal with it.

14:07.967 --> 14:10.600
Thank you.
Gimme a second
and we'll deal with it, okay?

14:10.633 --> 14:13.067
-It's not fake money,
man, it's just wet.
-Okay.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.800
Okay.
-Get back over there, please.

14:14.833 --> 14:18.300
-(radio chatter)
-Thanks. We'll be right
w-- with you.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.233
-All right, man.
-He's a business owner, okay.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.933
He's sayin' a crime--
he's sayin' a crime
committed, so we're

14:22.967 --> 14:24.833
just gonna detain you
right now, okay?

14:24.867 --> 14:27.300
You're not in custody
until we can figure out--
how did you get this injury

14:27.333 --> 14:28.400
on your head?
-He hit me.

14:28.433 --> 14:29.967
-He did?
-He (bleep) hit me
and (bleep).

14:30.067 --> 14:31.600
I tried to go in there,
buy a pack of cigarettes,

14:31.633 --> 14:32.900
he started (bleep)
beatin' on me.
-Okay.

14:32.933 --> 14:34.133
Got anything illegal
on you?

14:34.167 --> 14:35.433
-No, man I got
nothin' illegal.

14:35.467 --> 14:37.667
-Okay. All right.
I'm gonna pat you
for weapons, okay?

14:37.700 --> 14:41.133
-Fine. Yeah.
-Let's figure this out,
all right?

14:41.167 --> 14:43.067
-Why don't you go check
that 20 dollars out,
that's real.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.900
-I got--
I got an officer comin'.

14:44.933 --> 14:46.500
-You got an ID on you?
-No, I don't.

14:46.533 --> 14:49.933
-Okay.
-He can very easily
go in there

14:49.967 --> 14:51.300
and switch that
20 dollars--
-We-- we--

14:51.333 --> 14:53.333
-I wish you guys
would go over there.
-Okay. We will go over--

14:53.367 --> 14:55.833
Here's the deal.
-If he takes that 20 dollars
that's real and switches it...

14:55.867 --> 14:58.067
-Here's the deal--
-...then it looks like
I'm guilty of somethin'.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.400
-Okay. We have a pretty good
relationship with him, okay?

15:00.433 --> 15:03.067
I'm not gonna take sides
with him automatically,
but I'm gonna let you know,

15:03.100 --> 15:05.933
okay? We deal with him
quite a bit, all right?

15:05.967 --> 15:07.533
So what we're gonna do
is get your information.

15:07.567 --> 15:10.400
As soon as we get
another officer freed up,
he's gonna go talk to him.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.400
Okay?
All right?

15:12.433 --> 15:14.067
-Dude, I can get
his info for you.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.500
Um, he's usually armed,
just so you know.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.367
But we-- we know him
pretty well, so...

15:18.400 --> 15:20.833
-You good?
-I'm good, I'm good.
Thank you.

15:20.867 --> 15:23.367
What's your first name?
-Jessie.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.767
-About some of the dumbest ass
fake money here in the world.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.067
-Okay.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.667
-Do you have your weapon on you?

15:28.700 --> 15:30.733
Okay. You don't reach
for yours, I won't reach
for mine, all right?

15:30.767 --> 15:32.133
-I gotcha.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.600
-He came in, and, uh,
wanted a pack of cigarettes.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.300
-Okay.
-Um... he handed it to me,

15:36.333 --> 15:38.167
I could tell it was fake.
-Right...

15:38.200 --> 15:40.100
-As you can tell yourself.
-Right.

15:40.133 --> 15:42.200
-I was like, "Why are you
giving me fake money, buddy?"

15:42.233 --> 15:44.833
"It's not fake, it's real,
it just got wet. That's all."

15:44.867 --> 15:46.867
I was like, "Dude," I was like,
"this is fake as hell."

15:46.900 --> 15:48.733
-Okay.
-I was like, "Where'd
you come from?"

15:48.767 --> 15:50.533
He goes, "Oh, I came
from down South."

15:50.567 --> 15:53.100
I was like, "Let me tell you
a little something about
tryin' to bring in fake money.

15:53.133 --> 15:55.500
When you use fake money
at somebody's store, that's
rippin' them off."

15:55.533 --> 15:57.700
-All right.
-So I turned around, I'm
just like, "I'm gonna need you

15:57.733 --> 15:59.433
"to turn around, put
your hands behind your back,

15:59.467 --> 16:00.667
so I can put cuffs on you."

16:00.700 --> 16:02.900
"No, bro, I ain't
goin' nowhere.
No, bro."

16:02.933 --> 16:05.700
Well, he started
flailin' his arms, and we got
into a little fistfight.

16:05.733 --> 16:08.300
-Okay.
-So I just hit my hand.
That's how he got his.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.600
-Okay, is, you hit him
on the head?
-Yeah. So...

16:10.633 --> 16:12.967
I got a finger injury
and that's it.
-Okay.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.700
Do you need EMS?
Are you hurt anywhere else?
-No, no.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.067
-No? Okay.

16:16.067 --> 16:18.167
-So, how long ago
did you get that bill?
-I just found it,

16:18.200 --> 16:20.133
right down the road,
about, like 30 minutes ago.

16:20.167 --> 16:21.467
-Okay, so you picked it up.
-Yeah.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.900
-Okay.
You needed-- you needed
to come up here

16:23.933 --> 16:26.300
and get cigarettes?
-Well, yeah, I was on my way
down that way,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.700
I wanted to get some cigarettes.
so I stopped here, you know?
-Okay.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.567
Have you been here before?
-Yeah, I've been here before.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.133
-Okay, good.
So, which bill--
did you use that--

16:33.167 --> 16:35.433
did you use--
-It's the only one I had,
the one I found on the ground.

16:35.467 --> 16:38.233
-Okay.
Does this bill look familiar?

16:38.267 --> 16:40.467
It's a wet bill.
-Yeah. Yeah, same bill.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.867
-Okay. Okay.
I'm tryin' to figure out,
in your estimation,

16:42.900 --> 16:45.133
if you thought it was just wet,
and there was nothin'
weird about it.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.700
-No, I just found it
on the ground and thought,
wow, God, I got lucky,

16:47.733 --> 16:49.767
that's awesome, you know?
And I went to go get
some cigarettes,

16:49.800 --> 16:52.333
'cause I don't have any.
Ain't had one for a few hours.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.800
You know?
-Okay.

16:53.833 --> 16:56.500
Tell me a little about
what happened, how you
got your injuries.

16:56.533 --> 16:59.567
-He tried to, uh,
citizen's arrest me,
and I-- I-- you know,

16:59.600 --> 17:02.100
I wouldn't--
-What did he say to you
in the store, I guess?

17:02.133 --> 17:05.333
-Uh, "You tried to use
fake money," and he came
around and, you know,

17:05.367 --> 17:08.667
just... he said, "Turn around
and put your hands
behind your back,"

17:08.700 --> 17:10.333
and I was like,
"No, man, that ain't
fake money."

17:10.367 --> 17:12.300
-Okay.
-And I tried talkin' to him
and he didn't wanna talk.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.433
-Okay. Did you try to exit
or did you stay in the store?

17:15.467 --> 17:18.533
-I tried-- I tried to get out,
he said, "Get out the store,"
so I tried to get out the store,

17:18.567 --> 17:19.733
and he hit me, you know?
-With what?

17:19.767 --> 17:21.067
-With his fist.
-Okay.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.600
-You know?
And then, I don't know
what the hell else

17:22.633 --> 17:24.267
he hit me with.
I was tryin' to get
out the store.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.833
-Okay.
Did you strike him
or anything like that?

17:25.867 --> 17:26.967
-No, I ain't touch him.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.267
-Okay.
The whole time what was
he sayin'?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.367
Was he mad at you?
Was he sayin', "Hey, stop"?

17:30.400 --> 17:33.200
-He was upset 'cause he thought
I was usin' a fake bill on him
or somethin', I don't know.

17:33.233 --> 17:34.933
-But no, the shop owner
came out.

17:34.967 --> 17:39.200
Um, he went over there
after we got him
in custody.

17:39.233 --> 17:42.267
He went back over
the store and pulled that out.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.500
-Uh, what's--
how's the bill look?
-Uh, this is a counterfeit

17:45.533 --> 17:47.067
$20 bill.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.500
-Okay. Good deal.
-He gave me the rundown
on what actually happened

17:50.533 --> 17:52.500
in the store.
-Okay.

17:52.533 --> 17:55.200
Basically, uh, the bill's--
the bill is fake, okay?

17:55.233 --> 17:57.100
Definitely looks fake
from-- from our
training experience,

17:57.133 --> 17:59.633
so I'm gonna search you
for any other evidence, okay?

17:59.667 --> 18:03.633
Of-- of those bills,
you said nothin' else
is illegal is on you, right?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.200
-So I'm under arrest, then?

18:05.233 --> 18:08.400
-Uh, well, basically,
technically, yeah,
you committed a crime, okay?

18:08.433 --> 18:11.833
Now, whether or not
we're gonna book you,
uh, I don't know, okay?

18:11.867 --> 18:13.733
We may be able to give you
a ticket, okay?

18:13.767 --> 18:15.967
-In my experience, when
I walk through a store
and they mark a bill,

18:16.067 --> 18:19.267
and it's black ink on it,
and it stays black,
the bill's real.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.767
So I don't understand how
that bill's fake when it
has a black mark on it.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.633
-I've dealt with a lot
of different counterfeit bills--

18:26.667 --> 18:30.933
twenties, fives, ones, hundreds.
That is a fake $20 bill.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.100
-When you're doin'
somethin' like that,
that's rippin' me off.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.900
You come back
on my store, my property,

18:34.933 --> 18:37.100
that's grounds for arrest...

18:37.133 --> 18:39.867
by me, and then these guys
will come pick you up.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.233
These officers will tell you,
this is South Broadway,
we don't mess around here.

18:43.267 --> 18:46.167
This is my property,
this is my business,
this is my livelihood.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.267
I do not appreciate
bein' ripped off.

18:48.300 --> 18:54.067
Dude, in my 20-somethin'
years, that is the worst example
of fake money I've ever seen.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.967
I've even had money
that says "fake money" on it,

18:56.067 --> 18:58.700
and that was still worse.

18:58.733 --> 19:03.400
Dude, you're a grown-ass man,
and you don't know what
fake money looks like?

19:03.433 --> 19:06.600
-Tell you the truth,
I ain't seen a bill of any kind
for quite some time.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.233
I ain't had no money.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.467
And that bill was wet.
It looked real to me, man.
Looked like a $20 bill.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.167
-Okay, I'm gonna tell you
somethin' right now, too.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.333
Do not come back
to my property.

19:13.367 --> 19:14.367
I don't wanna see you again.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.567
-Got it.
-Got it?

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
-Got it?
-Good.

19:16.633 --> 19:17.667
-Have a good one.
Thank you.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.100
-Thank you.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.833
-Hey, Jessie?
Just-- just, I wanna
make sure that you're--

19:21.867 --> 19:25.533
that you understand--
okay, you're gonna be
a suspect, okay?

19:25.567 --> 19:27.600
But we're releasin' you,
okay, today.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.467
-Yeah, I mean... I guess
I won't spend no money
I found on the ground no more.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.867
-Well, here's the deal.
Gentleman that owns the
store has trespassed you

19:32.900 --> 19:36.133
from his property.
Please adhere to his
wishes, okay?

19:36.167 --> 19:39.800
So, you understand?
Detectives will see
the case, okay?

19:39.833 --> 19:41.933
There's a possibility
they could pick that case up.

19:41.967 --> 19:44.700
But today, we are gonna--
you're gonna be free
to go, all right?

19:44.733 --> 19:46.467
-Yeah.
-Do you have any questions
for me, or anything

19:46.500 --> 19:47.500
that happened?
-No, I don't.

19:47.533 --> 19:48.733
-All right.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.233
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.267 --> 19:54.200
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.233 --> 19:55.367
Cover is code three.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.367
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.433 --> 20:07.000
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:09.567 --> 20:14.967
-(theme music playing)
