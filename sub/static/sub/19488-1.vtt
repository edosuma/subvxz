were tougher than that.

05:56.525 --> 05:59.111
You're gonna let me borrow the
van, right?

05:59.111 --> 06:01.739
Yes, I'll let you borrow the
van. But you're gonna be missing
out.

06:01.739 --> 06:03.074
On what?

06:03.074 --> 06:04.784
On being one with nature.

he was hot?

I'm not gonna hook up with some
guy in a random bathroom.

06:45.449 --> 06:47.118
He probably would have slit your
throat.

06:47.118 --> 06:48.786
Or stuffed it.

06:48.786 --> 06:50.287
What? Eww.

Why did I come?

07:05.302 --> 07:07.263
Because I asked you to?

07:07.263 --> 07:10.057
Why did you do that?

07:10.057 --> 07:14.103
Because you're my friend, and I
need somebody to have fun with
while these two are screwing
each others brains out.

07:14.103 --> 07:16.772

start?

15:35.854 --> 15:37.731
No, I'm gonna fuck his brains
out!

Don't you guys do that like, all
the time?

15:39.733 --> 15:44.738
Well yeah, but there's all these
things that he wants to try, and
I'm like, eww.

15:44.738 --> 15:53.413
So I figured I could do one of
those, or you could help me with
something that would so super
duper awesome, it would totally
blow his mind, and he'd never
forget!

me to be in a three way.

like, you know one time, we'll
take a vow of secrecy.

we'll never have to talk about
it again.

so awesome. Please, please,
please, please, please think
about it?

you.

Well thank you for thinking
about it.

What happened?

17:16.538 --> 17:17.414
Is it in my hair?

Dude, would you calm down, I
don't see anything.

Oh shut up.

17:32.637 --> 17:34.723
You lost your shit.

17:34.723 --> 17:39.019
They have eight eyeballs, they
have eight eyeballs, and then
they wrap their prey up.

17:39.019 --> 17:43.064
And they suck the juice out of
them, while they're still alive,
okay? So this next one is all
you.

17:43.064 --> 17:45.233
You go first this time, and the
next one is all you.

17:45.233 --> 17:47.611
Okay, okay, okay. I'm just not
sure...

17:47.611 --> 17:49.029
If I'm as good a dancer as you!

17:49.029 --> 17:49.696
Fuck you!

But seriously, seriously though.

19:08.358 --> 19:11.152
Comfort him.

19:11.152 --> 19:14.114
Seriously though, I want to take
a minute, thank you guys all,
for coming out, this is making
my 26th really special.

19:14.114 --> 19:17.701
I know you're not all the
outdoorsy type, so it means a
lot.

19:17.701 --> 19:18.994
Oh, oh.

19:18.994 --> 19:20.745
Aww.

19:20.745 --> 19:22.497
You sure you guys wouldn't have
rather had a romantic getaway
for two?

19:22.497 --> 19:25.125
I mean, we always have a
romantic getaway for two.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.251
Wherever we are.

19:26.251 --> 19:30.964
Mmm hmm.

19:30.964 --> 19:33.174
Kind of like now.

19:33.174 --> 19:33.967
Hey third wheel.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.261
Sup fourth wheel?

19:36.261 --> 19:37.095
Come here baby.

19:37.095 --> 19:38.138
Oh yeah?

19:38.138 --> 19:39.097
Let's show these kids how to do
it.

19:39.097 --> 19:39.973
Let's do it.

19:39.973 --> 19:43.560
Give it to me.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.603
That's intense.

19:44.603 --> 19:45.520
I feel like I'm watching a
movie.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.105
Yeah.

19:47.105 --> 19:48.064
Should we pay a quarter for
this?

19:48.064 --> 19:52.152
Yeah we should.

19:52.152 --> 19:54.154
Oh my god.

19:54.154 --> 19:55.780
What?

19:55.780 --> 19:57.407
Oh my God.

19:57.407 --> 19:59.534
What?

19:59.534 --> 20:00.869
You turned me.

20:00.869 --> 20:01.661
No you turned me!

20:01.661 --> 20:03.121
Shut up.

20:03.121 --> 20:04.956
I don't even like the dick
anymore. I hate the dick!

20:04.956 --> 20:08.418
I have seen the light and I love
the pussy.

20:08.418 --> 20:10.295
Love the pussy!

20:10.295 --> 20:16.426
I love it so much, that you can
seat me at the pussy buffet, and
let me eat.

20:16.426 --> 20:19.596
Praise be brother.

20:19.596 --> 20:22.766
Oh no, I'm still gay.

20:22.766 --> 20:24.100
You're a jerk!

20:24.100 --> 20:26.519
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:26.519 --> 20:28.688
That's gross.

20:28.688 --> 20:34.069
Get me out of this fucking lake!

20:34.069 --> 22:47.410
[no dialogue]

22:47.410 --> 23:40.463
[no dialogue]

23:40.463 --> 24:45.778
[no dialogue]

24:45.778 --> 25:03.963
[low rumbling]

25:03.963 --> 26:45.273
[no dialogue]

26:45.273 --> 27:17.972
[low rumbling]

27:17.972 --> 27:27.565
Ben!

27:27.565 --> 27:31.611
Cat!

27:31.611 --> 27:34.864
Where are you?

27:34.864 --> 27:39.744
I found something.

27:39.744 --> 27:57.678
Over here!

27:57.678 --> 28:01.557
Look at this.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.601
What is that?

28:03.601 --> 28:05.937
I don't know, but it's gross.

28:05.937 --> 28:08.147
Ugh, stop playing with it.

28:08.147 --> 28:09.315
Where's Jennifer?

28:09.315 --> 28:11.401
I'm here.

28:11.401 --> 28:13.361
What the hell is that?

28:13.361 --> 28:16.030
I don't know, some goo?

28:16.030 --> 28:17.281
A bikini?

28:17.281 --> 28:20.034
Nasty.

28:20.034 --> 28:21.494
I don't know.

28:21.494 --> 28:25.623
Let's get back to the cabin, you
guys owe me dinner.

28:25.623 --> 29:44.911
You owe me more.

29:44.911 --> 29:51.542
You know you're doing that
wrong, right?

29:51.542 --> 29:52.376
Cat, here ya go.

29:52.376 --> 29:54.212
Oh, yay!

29:54.212 --> 29:55.963
Aww.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.465
Josh: That was my fluffy ball!

29:57.465 --> 29:58.758
That one's yours.

29:58.758 --> 29:59.967
Josh: Why is that one mine?

29:59.967 --> 30:02.094
Because I said it's yours.

30:02.094 --> 30:06.390
Ben: Who are you to deny a man
his little fluffy balls?

30:06.390 --> 30:09.018
Ben: We'll make you one buddy.

30:09.018 --> 30:12.980
Josh: How about you just hand me
the stick, and I'll make my own,
cause I'm really good with
sticks and balls.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.567
All right Jennifer, while we're
talking sticks and balls-

30:16.567 --> 30:20.404
We've got mallows, and we've got
weiners.

30:20.404 --> 30:21.739
Would you like a weiner?

30:21.739 --> 30:23.658
No, those are disgusting.

30:23.658 --> 30:26.953
What are you talking about, are
you a terrorist?

30:26.953 --> 30:30.248
They're made out of lips and
assholes, and other animal
parts.

30:30.248 --> 30:34.001
Yeah, but they're American lips,
and assholes, and other animal
parts.

30:34.001 --> 30:35.920
Yeah, don't be so sure.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.423
Okay, you are either with the
lips and assholes, or you are
against them.

30:39.423 --> 30:41.259
Now what's it going to be?

30:41.259 --> 30:44.303
Mark: What's this about lips and
assholes, are we at war?

30:44.303 --> 30:46.472
Cat: You came!

30:46.472 --> 30:51.269
Yeah well, there's not a whole
lot to do when the sun goes
down, and you're by yourself.

30:51.269 --> 30:53.688
Everyone this is Mark, I met him
on the road earlier

30:53.688 --> 30:57.775
This is Ben, Jennifer, and Josh.

30:57.775 --> 30:58.526
Hi.

30:58.526 --> 30:59.902
Hey!

30:59.902 --> 31:02.196
I hear it's your birthday. Happy
birthday.

31:02.196 --> 31:05.700
Thank you very much. Do you
partake?

31:05.700 --> 31:07.285
No, I'm good, thanks.

31:07.285 --> 31:11.622
Well, it's here if you need it.
And you arrived just in time.

31:11.622 --> 31:13.541
Just in time for what?

31:13.541 --> 31:15.543
Time for games!

31:15.543 --> 31:17.420
No, no games, not yet.

31:17.420 --> 31:19.171
No, no no, Mark just got here,
we gotta get to know him.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.339
That's the idea.

31:20.339 --> 31:22.925
So, Mark, the name of this game
is hot seat.

31:22.925 --> 31:25.511
And Mark, you are in the hot
seat.

31:25.511 --> 31:26.637
Cat, are you with me?

31:26.637 --> 31:29.473
With you.

31:29.473 --> 31:33.603
So the rules for hot seat is,
you have to answer all of our
questions as quickly, and as
honestly as possible.

31:33.603 --> 31:35.688
Mark, are you ready to play hot
seat?

31:35.688 --> 31:37.607
Sure, why the hell not?

31:37.607 --> 31:43.904
All right, Mark. First question.

31:43.904 --> 31:46.574
Have you ever killed a man?

31:46.574 --> 31:47.408
No.

31:47.408 --> 31:49.118
Have you ever been to jail?

31:49.118 --> 31:50.286
No.

31:50.286 --> 31:52.872
Have you ever shit your pants as
a grown man?

31:52.872 --> 31:54.332
No.

31:54.332 --> 31:56.167
Are you sure, you've never shit
your pants as a grown man?

31:56.167 --> 31:57.960
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.087
Do you do any illegal drugs?

32:00.087 --> 32:01.380
Technically.

32:01.380 --> 32:02.632
Did you bring any?

32:02.632 --> 32:04.050
Yes.

32:04.050 --> 32:06.510
Would you be willing to share
with the entire class?

32:06.510 --> 32:09.805
Sure.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.932
Mark have you ever brought a
woman to orgasm?

32:11.932 --> 32:13.351
Yes.

32:13.351 --> 32:16.812
Have you ever brought a woman to
triple orgasm?

32:16.812 --> 32:18.981
I'm gonna need an answer Mark.

32:18.981 --> 32:22.234
I can neither confirm, or deny.

32:22.234 --> 32:25.696
Have you ever put a fruit or
vegetable up your butt?

32:25.696 --> 32:31.077
What?

32:31.077 --> 32:33.579
No!

32:33.579 --> 32:38.334
Mark are you lying to Cat about
whether or not you have ever put
a fruit or a vegetable up your
rectum?

32:38.334 --> 32:39.794
Maybe.

32:39.794 --> 32:41.128
Was it a zucchini?

32:41.128 --> 32:42.254
God no!

32:42.254 --> 32:43.422
A banana?

32:43.422 --> 32:44.298
No.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.591
Was it a Kumquat?

32:45.591 --> 32:48.302
Next question, please.

32:48.302 --> 32:58.229
All right Mark, this is the
final question in the hot seat,
so for all the marbles, can I
get a drum roll Josh?

32:58.229 --> 32:59.939
Mark!

32:59.939 --> 33:02.566
Beatles or Elvis?

33:02.566 --> 33:04.652
Elvis, final answer.

33:04.652 --> 33:06.487
I feel like I know Mark.

33:06.487 --> 33:08.614
Now that we've terrified you.

33:08.614 --> 33:10.408
No, no, it's totally fine.

33:10.408 --> 33:13.244
I wanna know what fruit he put
up his butt.

33:13.244 --> 33:16.872
All right, all right, you were
right.

33:16.872 --> 33:18.374
It was a banana.

33:18.374 --> 33:20.626
He lied, he lied!

33:20.626 --> 33:22.253
Umm, what's the penalty for
lying?

33:22.253 --> 33:25.256
Well, the penalty is, you have
to go first in truth or dare.

33:25.256 --> 33:28.801
So if I go first, I'm the one
that asks someone else truth or
dare.

33:28.801 --> 33:30.886
Yeah, it's not much of a
penalty.

33:30.886 --> 33:34.098
Okay, uh, Jennifer.

33:34.098 --> 33:36.392
Oh no.

33:36.392 --> 33:38.352
Truth, or dare?

33:38.352 --> 33:39.562
Oh shit.

33:39.562 --> 33:42.565
Ah, nope Jennifer.

33:42.565 --> 33:44.650
We've been over this before.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.944
The options are truth or dare.

33:46.944 --> 33:53.784
The options aren't truth, dare,
or shit.

33:53.784 --> 33:55.703
Truth.

33:55.703 --> 34:00.958
Okay, umm, I guess I'm supposed
to make this one a dirty one,
huh?

34:00.958 --> 34:02.585
Bring it.

34:02.585 --> 34:12.094
Okay, was your first sexual
experience a good one, or a bad
one?

34:12.094 --> 34:15.014
I'm gonna go with, bad.

34:15.014 --> 34:16.014
Next.

34:16.014 --> 34:16.974
Details, details.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.309
Boo!

34:18.309 --> 34:21.728
Details.

34:21.728 --> 34:26.065
Well, I mean, we were fifteen.

34:26.065 --> 34:30.654
And he just, didn't know what he
was doing, right? He just didnt.

34:30.654 --> 34:36.827
What was his name?

34:36.827 --> 34:38.996
Roger.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.081
Josh: That's where you went
wrong.

34:41.081 --> 34:43.918
His name was Roger? Who's
grandfather was he?

34:43.918 --> 34:48.297
And Roger was a nice boy, but I
don't care how nice a fifteen
year old boy is.

34:48.297 --> 34:51.801
When you guys are horny at that
age, you're all the same.

34:51.801 --> 34:53.636
You're like dogs.

34:53.636 --> 34:54.929
We are very excitable.

34:54.929 --> 34:55.554
Yeah.

34:55.554 --> 34:56.472
Tell me about it.

34:56.472 --> 34:58.557
Roger was in before I knew it.

34:58.557 --> 35:01.519
And I told him to go slow, and
easy, and he was like-

35:01.519 --> 35:10.277
Oh baby, it's my first time too.
And I promise I'll make it good
for you.

35:10.277 --> 35:13.906
I mean I told him to slow down
and take it easy, but-

35:13.906 --> 35:19.078
That horny little fucker
jackhammered me for about twenty
whole seconds, until it was all
over.

35:19.078 --> 35:22.832
The only thing I got out of that
experience was a split hymen.

35:22.832 --> 35:27.211
You know, the doctor says that I
split my hymen in P.E. that time
when I was playing volleyball
and I did the splits-

35:27.211 --> 35:30.005
Baby, baby, baby.

35:30.005 --> 35:34.009
Wait your turn.

35:34.009 --> 35:37.638
I know you love that story, but
it's not your turn.

35:37.638 --> 35:40.349
Anyway, it was awkward.

35:40.349 --> 35:44.895
And he was like a robot the
whole time we were doing it.

35:44.895 --> 35:47.356
And he lost interest in me
immediately afterwards.

35:47.356 --> 35:49.525
Aww.

35:49.525 --> 35:53.654
Don't give me sympathy mother
fucker, truth or dare.

35:53.654 --> 35:54.196
Me?

35:54.196 --> 35:55.698
Yeah, you!

35:55.698 --> 35:59.118
Oh uh, truth.

35:59.118 --> 36:01.120
Cat: Ya'll are pussies!

36:01.120 --> 36:03.622
Josh: Jesus Christ!

36:03.622 --> 36:06.000
Ben: Your turn will come.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.920
Josh: Yeah, just calm down over
there, P.E.

36:09.920 --> 36:15.509
All right, right back at ya.
What was your most embarrassing
sexual experience?

36:15.509 --> 36:20.598
Wait, wait, wait. Are we
counting the bathroom today?

36:20.598 --> 36:21.932
Old man glory hole?

36:21.932 --> 36:24.226
Shut up.

36:24.226 --> 36:26.687
Shut up, I'm never gonna live
that down.

36:26.687 --> 36:30.941
Uh no, it would probably be, no
it's with my friend Jude.

36:30.941 --> 36:33.611
Hey.

36:33.611 --> 36:35.946
Shut up.

36:35.946 --> 36:43.037
Uh, we were in high school
together. He came over one day,
we were hanging out, and you
know.

36:43.037 --> 36:51.128
Things were going good, and I
thought things were kinda
leading to fellatio.

36:51.128 --> 36:53.464
Who says fellatio?

36:53.464 --> 36:55.799
I'm very proper.

36:55.799 --> 37:02.181
So you know, I thought, well I
took a bathroom break, and I
went and I cleaned up, as you
do.

37:02.181 --> 37:09.813
I came back, and low and behold,
one thing led to another and he
went down on me.

37:09.813 --> 37:18.781
And immediately jumped back up,
spitting, and said, your dick
tastes like soap.

37:18.781 --> 37:20.783
Aww, babys first blow job.

37:20.783 --> 37:22.785
Thank you for laughing at my
pain.

37:22.785 --> 37:28.499
You, if you learned anything,
you just should have left it in
it's natural juices.

37:28.499 --> 37:30.209
Captain soap dick!

37:30.209 --> 37:32.252
All right, so Cat-

37:32.252 --> 37:33.170
Dare! Dare me!

37:33.170 --> 37:34.004
Oh my god.

37:34.004 --> 37:35.089
Dare me.

37:35.089 --> 37:36.090
I knew you were going to say
that.

37:36.090 --> 37:37.091
Why would you do this?

37:37.091 --> 37:39.301
You would totally say that.

37:39.301 --> 37:42.846
Oh my god, this is hard because
there's nothing you won't do.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.808
Um, dare me to sit on someone's
face.

37:45.808 --> 37:46.976
Dare me to sit on his face!

37:46.976 --> 37:50.270
Okay, Cat, I dare you to sit on
Ben's face.

37:50.270 --> 37:52.940
Yay, I'm gonna sit on your face!
I have to do it, I have to.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.525
This is my birthday!

37:54.525 --> 37:56.151
I know, and for your birthday,
I'm just gonna sit on your face.

37:56.151 --> 37:58.070
I have to, it's a dare! It's a
dare!

37:58.070 --> 37:58.737
No!

37:58.737 --> 37:59.989
Don't you pinch me!

37:59.989 --> 38:01.198
I'm gonna fucking pinch you if I
fucking want to!

38:01.198 --> 38:02.074
Stop, no!

38:02.074 --> 38:02.866
Just let me sit on your face!

38:02.866 --> 38:03.826
I'm gonna sit on your face!

38:03.826 --> 38:05.744
No, no no!

38:05.744 --> 38:07.246
Yes!

38:07.246 --> 38:08.747
Stop, that tickles.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.332
I want to sit on your face, I
want to sit on your face.

38:10.332 --> 38:12.459
All right.

38:12.459 --> 38:15.879
You can sit on my face, but you
have to do something nice for me
later.

38:15.879 --> 38:18.590
Of course I'm gonna do something
nice for you later.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.010
All right, fine. Get it over
with.

38:21.010 --> 38:23.512
Yes! Yes!

38:23.512 --> 38:24.805
I'm gonna put my butt on your
face!

38:24.805 --> 38:26.306
All right.

38:26.306 --> 38:27.182
Let me hold my breath.

38:27.182 --> 38:27.850
All right.

38:27.850 --> 38:29.226
Josh: Three! Two!

38:29.226 --> 38:30.394
Josh: One!

38:30.394 --> 38:33.564
Josh: Contact!

38:33.564 --> 38:36.442
I'm sitting on your face, I'm
sitting on your face.

38:36.442 --> 38:37.860
All right, you can get off me
now.

38:37.860 --> 38:41.864
Don't move!

38:41.864 --> 38:45.576
[playful squealing]

38:45.576 --> 38:46.952
Don't put me in the fire, don't
let him put me in the fire,
don't put me in the fire!

38:46.952 --> 38:48.328
Fine, fine fine, sit down.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.663
Cat: In your face!

38:49.663 --> 38:52.875
Her other lips are sweaty too.

38:52.875 --> 38:56.336
And they're on your face!

38:56.336 --> 38:58.964
So, Cat. It is your turn to ask
a question.

38:58.964 --> 39:00.299
All right.

39:00.299 --> 39:05.721
Ummm, Mark. Truth or dare?

39:05.721 --> 39:08.223
Challenge accepted. I'm gonna
say dare.

39:08.223 --> 39:13.604
Oooh!

39:13.604 --> 39:15.731
Mark.

39:15.731 --> 39:18.484
I dare you.

39:18.484 --> 39:29.036
To kiss the person you find here
most sexually attractive on the
lips, for at least five
seconds.

39:29.036 --> 39:31.288
Oh wow, a whole five seconds!

39:31.288 --> 39:33.374
A whole five seconds.

39:33.374 --> 39:38.337
I'm right here, it's fine, it's
okay.

39:38.337 --> 39:45.677
Hey I am comfortable in my
heterosexuality, so if you need
to kiss me, you go ahead and
plant one right there.

39:45.677 --> 39:49.473
Cat: Awww, Jennifer's gonna get
some!

39:49.473 --> 39:52.726
Josh: Say hi to Roger!

39:52.726 --> 39:59.274
Cat: Oh, oh!

39:59.274 --> 40:01.652
You gonna stand up or what?

40:01.652 --> 40:27.386
Yes.

40:27.386 --> 40:29.304
I think that's a little more
than five seconds.

40:29.304 --> 40:34.560
Cat: Hmmm, no, shoosh, shut up.

40:34.560 --> 40:39.273
Guys I mean, come on, get a
room, or a tent, or something.

40:39.273 --> 40:43.694
This could be a round in a game,
or this could go all night, if
you want.

40:43.694 --> 40:45.696
It's your call.

40:45.696 --> 40:47.114
Cool?

40:47.114 --> 40:48.490
Cool.

40:48.490 --> 40:57.166
Cool.

40:57.166 --> 40:58.792
That just happened.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.545
Yeah it did!

41:01.545 --> 41:05.632
Cat: Well I guess that's the end
of truth or dare.

41:05.632 --> 41:10.053
That's why, we have our own way
to make things fun.

41:10.053 --> 41:12.681
Yes we do.

41:12.681 --> 41:19.813
And it will be much easier to do
that, with-

41:19.813 --> 41:21.148
This.

41:21.148 --> 41:23.275
Mmm hmm, one for you.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.401
I thank you.

41:24.401 --> 41:37.289
You're welcome.

41:37.289 --> 41:43.504
Now Jennifer and I are going to
go in the house and get your
birthday present ready.

41:43.504 --> 41:45.797
All right.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.967
We'll be right back!

41:48.967 --> 41:57.935
Okay.

41:57.935 --> 42:41.228
[heavy breathing in sound
design]

42:41.228 --> 42:55.450
Are you ready?

42:55.450 --> 42:59.746
Yeah, I'm, I'm ready.

42:59.746 --> 43:01.498
Close your eyes.

43:01.498 --> 43:06.503
Okay.

43:06.503 --> 43:09.339
Keep them closed.

43:09.339 --> 43:15.178
They're closed.

43:15.178 --> 43:21.351
Okay you can open them.

43:21.351 --> 43:24.688
You got me, you?

43:24.688 --> 43:31.361
Well, us.

43:31.361 --> 43:36.450
You know how most guys fantasize
about being with two girls at
the same time?

43:36.450 --> 43:39.453
Well yeah, I mean what guy
doesn't?

43:39.453 --> 43:46.793
Well tonight, you get to be that
guy.

43:46.793 --> 43:49.129
Seriously?

43:49.129 --> 43:58.263
Seriously.

43:58.263 --> 44:01.058
Josh: So they say eight months
is a long time for two guys to
be together.

44:01.058 --> 44:04.770
I don't know, I guess he just
thought it was time. I don't
know.

44:04.770 --> 44:07.105
Mark: Did you ever think we
weren't meant to be monogamous?

44:07.105 --> 44:08.065
Well-

44:08.065 --> 44:11.610
Well nothing, it's not natural.

44:11.610 --> 44:14.613
It's an unfair expectation we
put on ourselves.

44:14.613 --> 44:17.324
I don't know there's some
comfort in a relationship.

44:17.324 --> 44:21.078
Yeah, but there's a fine line
between comfort, and
suffocation.

44:21.078 --> 44:23.789
Yeah, sounds like somebody has
been through some terrible
relationships.

44:23.789 --> 44:30.045
Not really, I just know a lot of
miserable people who are stuck
in relationships they don't want
to be in anymore.

44:30.045 --> 44:32.798
Maybe there's such a thing as
serial monogamy.

44:32.798 --> 44:36.176
All right, there ya go! Like
monkeys.

44:36.176 --> 44:37.469
Monkeys?

44:37.469 --> 44:40.847
Yeah! I saw this documentary on
monkeys one time.

44:40.847 --> 44:47.020
They've sort of got the
monogamous thing going on, but
they also just kind of mess
around with the whole tribe.

44:47.020 --> 44:52.609
You know young, old, gay,
straight, monkeys just go with
the flow and have a good time
apparently.

44:52.609 --> 44:57.239
Hmm, I also watched a video of a
monkey masturbating with a frog.

44:57.239 --> 45:00.492
He just picked that live little
thing up, put it's mouth right
on it's dick.

45:00.492 --> 45:02.661
And just murdered that thing!

45:02.661 --> 45:04.704
Oh wow.

45:04.704 --> 45:07.207
Yeah, so I don't know if we
should aspire to the social
politics of monkeys.

45:07.207 --> 45:09.334
I don't know.

45:09.334 --> 45:11.294
Could be fun.

45:11.294 --> 45:13.213
So which do you want to be?

45:13.213 --> 45:15.549
The monkey or the frog?

45:15.549 --> 45:16.216
Here?

45:16.216 --> 45:19.720
Yeah! Sure, why not?

45:19.720 --> 45:27.436
Come on, you do not want to be
ninety years old, lying on your
deathbed, remembering the time
you were alone in the woods with
a guy you barely know.

45:27.436 --> 45:34.276
And you could've played monkey
and the frog, but you didn't,
and-

45:34.276 --> 46:09.102
Ribbit.

46:09.102 --> 46:12.022
Wow, all this for me?

46:12.022 --> 46:37.047
Uh huh, but before you get it
all, you gotta do a little
something for us first.

46:37.047 --> 46:46.139
[heavy breathing]

46:46.139 --> 47:02.405
[snorting]

47:02.405 --> 47:04.241
Wait, stop, stop.

47:04.241 --> 47:05.867
Why?

47:05.867 --> 47:08.245
Because I don't want to finish
yet.

47:08.245 --> 47:09.371
It's my turn.

47:09.371 --> 47:20.840
Okay.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.551
Tastes like soap.

47:22.551 --> 47:24.052
That's very funny.

47:24.052 --> 47:27.931
Now wash your mouth out with it.

47:27.931 --> 47:31.810
[heavy breathing]

47:31.810 --> 47:35.522
[gasps]

47:35.522 --> 47:38.483
Oh, relax.

47:38.483 --> 47:40.277
She was-

47:40.277 --> 47:43.989
No, no, no, you're just high,
it's okay just come on down.

47:43.989 --> 47:47.742
Just lie back.

47:47.742 --> 48:07.596
Let us take care of you, and
just enjoy the show, okay?

48:07.596 --> 48:08.888
You cool?

48:08.888 --> 48:15.145
Yeah.

48:15.145 --> 48:24.404
[wet kissing sounds]

48:24.404 --> 48:27.616
You know this trip turned out a
lot more interesting than I
thought it was going to.

48:27.616 --> 48:29.534
Yeah?

48:29.534 --> 48:38.918
Yeah. I thought I was going to
be the fifth wheel, but instead,
I'm the frog.

48:38.918 --> 48:42.964
Blame these woods man.

48:42.964 --> 48:45.175
I've been horny ever since I got
here.

48:45.175 --> 49:02.734
Prove it.

49:02.734 --> 49:31.763
[slimy, slithering sound]

49:31.763 --> 50:11.010
[Cat begins gagging, struggling]

50:11.010 --> 50:29.070
[In a strange voice] Won't you
let us in?

50:29.070 --> 50:42.500
[heavy breathing]

50:42.500 --> 50:46.671
Aren't you gonna look at me?

50:46.671 --> 50:50.383
Hey!

50:50.383 --> 50:52.343
Good.

50:52.343 --> 51:07.942
It's better when you're awake.

51:07.942 --> 51:28.296
[heavy breathing]

51:28.296 --> 51:43.853
[breathing normalizes]

51:43.853 --> 52:12.382

[sound of something emerging
from the water]

53:28.791 --> 54:00.198
[birds chirping]

54:00.198 --> 54:14.629
Mark?

54:14.629 --> 54:30.645
Mark!

54:30.645 --> 54:45.868
Hey!

54:45.868 --> 55:26.826
Hello?

55:26.826 --> 55:37.628
Hello?

55:37.628 --> 56:25.927
Anybody?

56:25.927 --> 57:33.369
[heavy breathing in sound
design]

57:33.369 --> 57:37.498
It's as sweet as mother's milk.

57:37.498 --> 57:40.126
And as nourishing.

57:40.126 --> 57:44.755
Drink.

57:44.755 --> 57:47.091
Where is everyone else?

57:47.091 --> 57:49.677
Around.

57:49.677 --> 57:53.181
Why are you wearing a bed sheet
in the middle of the woods?

57:53.181 --> 57:56.976
Night never really has to end
Josh.

57:56.976 --> 57:59.020
What does that mean?

57:59.020 --> 58:02.565
It means you don't have to go
back to your boring old life.

58:02.565 --> 58:05.568
You never have to be alone
again.

58:05.568 --> 58:11.365
All you have to do is drink.

58:11.365 --> 58:39.101
I don't want to.

58:39.101 --> 58:43.564
Drink.

58:43.564 --> 58:44.649
What are you doing?

58:44.649 --> 58:46.108
Drink!

58:46.108 --> 58:47.568
What is wrong with you?

58:47.568 --> 58:48.694
It will purify you.

58:48.694 --> 58:50.530
For what?

58:50.530 --> 59:35.491
You will drink.

59:35.491 --> 59:47.044
[grunting, moaning]

59:47.044 --> 01:00:12.737
[sounds of wilderness in sound
design]

01:00:12.737 --> 01:00:14.572
Josh, what's wrong?

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:17.825
What's wrong? What the hell was
that back there? Where's Mark?

01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:20.620
He went back to his place. We
were just having a good time.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.913
A good time? That didn't look
like a good time to me.

01:00:22.913 --> 01:00:25.499
Since when do you act like that?

01:00:25.499 --> 01:00:28.502
Don't be such a prude.

01:00:28.502 --> 01:00:30.171
Why were you choking him?

01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:33.424
Because he asked me to?

01:00:33.424 --> 01:00:35.343
Just get away from the van.

01:00:35.343 --> 01:00:38.137
Josh, this is all just a big
misunderstanding, all right? Why
don't you just-

01:00:38.137 --> 01:00:41.057
I'm not, I'm not talking to you
okay? You fucking attacked me.

01:00:41.057 --> 01:00:41.766
What?

01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:42.767
You kicked me!

01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:43.893
I did not!

01:00:43.893 --> 01:00:45.478
Josh it's just the acid.

01:00:45.478 --> 01:00:47.438
I didn't take any acid bitch.

01:00:47.438 --> 01:00:50.608
Well it's something, you're
acting crazy.

01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:53.444
These woods are fucking crazy.

01:00:53.444 --> 01:01:10.753
Josh, will you just give me my
keys?

01:01:10.753 --> 01:01:15.633
Mark?

01:01:15.633 --> 01:01:20.763
Mark?

01:01:20.763 --> 01:01:22.390
What's the matter with you?

01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:23.349
Let go!

01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:24.767
Let go!

01:01:24.767 --> 01:01:30.022

Ben: It's going to be okay.

01:01:38.906 --> 01:02:25.077
Ben: You're going to love it.

01:02:25.077 --> 01:02:33.294
None of this will matter when
you drink.

01:02:33.294 --> 01:02:37.131
Nothing will ever matter again.

01:02:37.131 --> 01:04:25.906
Drink.

01:04:25.906 --> 01:04:28.868
It wants you, Josh.

01:04:28.868 --> 01:04:33.956
It wants us all...

01:04:33.956 --> 01:04:55.811
...back.

01:04:55.811 --> 01:05:03.402
It's ready for us.

[no dialogue]

01:06:02.378 --> 01:07:25.794
You'll be home soon.

of the water]
