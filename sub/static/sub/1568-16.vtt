WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.002
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.212 --> 00:04.545
Your bone marrow
can get us back to the ground.

00:04.755 --> 00:05.546
They'll never stop.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.882
They'll never
stop.

00:08.092 --> 00:10.259
She took the deal.
We've won.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.469
They're
surrendering?

00:11.679 --> 00:12.679
Not quite.

00:12.888 --> 00:13.763
What about prisoners
from the ark?

00:13.973 --> 00:15.098
They'll all
be killed,

00:15.307 --> 00:16.849
but you don't care
about that, do you?

00:17.059 --> 00:19.769
The duty to protect
my people comes first.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.690
Let me help them.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.821
Please don't
leave me here.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.531
It can't be over.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.949
Our ancestors
used a missile

00:33.158 --> 00:34.242
to destroy the world.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.327
We're gonna use one
to get back to it.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.371
Take this leap of faith
with me, John Murphy.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.956
This is our destiny.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.374
What the hell
is that?

00:41.583 --> 00:42.667
It's a drone.
We're gonna follow it.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.043
The city of light
is out there,

00:44.253 --> 00:45.169
and we are gonna find it.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.879
Now get in the boat.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.488
Yo, Ahab.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.115
Come back.
Get some rest.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.076
I'm fine.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.703
Oh, screw this.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.163
If you're
not gonna sleep,

01:20.372 --> 01:21.456
you can row.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.334
Get back on
that oar, Craig.

01:25.544 --> 01:26.502
Or what?

01:26.712 --> 01:27.754
We don't even know
if we're going

01:27.963 --> 01:29.797
in the right
direction anymore.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.550
We followed that drone
across the open ocean.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.344
Hell, we deserve
to die out here.

01:35.554 --> 01:39.474
It's OK, it's OK.
I'm good to go. I can row.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.142
Land?

01:41.351 --> 01:43.019
Land!

01:43.228 --> 01:47.315
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.859
Ha ha ha!

01:50.069 --> 01:53.321
- Yeah!
- Ha ha ha!

01:53.530 --> 01:56.491
How does an island
of light sound to you, John, huh?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.534
Ha ha ha!

01:58.744 --> 02:01.079
Ha ha ha!

02:02.456 --> 02:04.791
- Oh!
- Damn it!

02:05.000 --> 02:07.043
What was that?

02:07.252 --> 02:08.628
Get that oar.
Get that oar.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.510
Richards! There's
something in the water!

02:15.719 --> 02:17.595
The oar!

02:20.516 --> 02:24.018
Aah! Ah!

02:26.146 --> 02:28.773
My arm.
Oh, my arm.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.317
I don't see it.
Where is it?

02:31.527 --> 02:33.778
Richards! Richards!

02:33.987 --> 02:37.073
What the hell
was that thing?

02:39.576 --> 02:42.203
We need to row now.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.205
It's back. Hold on!

02:44.414 --> 02:46.666
- Where is it?
- Craig, row.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.000
- Row, Craig!
- Where is it?

02:49.461 --> 02:50.670
Craig, row!

02:50.879 --> 02:52.171
We're gonna sink.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.423
We're all gonna die.
We're all gonna die.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.552
I can do it.
I can row.

02:57.761 --> 02:58.636
Go! Row!

02:58.846 --> 02:59.804
Aah!

03:00.013 --> 03:02.557
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.642
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

03:04.852 --> 03:07.645
Aah! Aah! Aah!

03:13.944 --> 03:16.028
What the hell is--

03:16.238 --> 03:18.072
what the hell
is wrong with you?

03:20.492 --> 03:21.492
Hold on.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.496
It's gone.
Let's go.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.625
Why?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.586
So we could live.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.674
And because
you can row.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.548
It's about time.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.348
Fox.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.988
Octavia.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.324
You stayed.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.534
Screw you.
Of course I stayed.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.079
I know where
my loyalties lie.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.122
We have to get
in there.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.374
If that was possible,

04:51.583 --> 04:53.542
do you think I'd
still be out here?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.506
Why did Lexa sound
the retreat?

05:01.176 --> 05:02.802
She made a deal
with Mount Weather,

05:03.011 --> 05:06.430
freed the grounders,
and now we're on own.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.684
Stop! They'll
know we're here.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.398
What about Lincoln?
There's no way he

05:15.607 --> 05:17.108
would have gone along
with a plan like this.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.318
He didn't
they took him.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.987
What's wrong
with you?

05:21.196 --> 05:22.446
I am getting
through that door.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.739
And that's
your plan?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.074
Bellamy's counting
on you.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.576
Everyone's always
counting on you.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.786
Well, what do you
want from me?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.454
You trusted Lexa.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.331
You let a bomb drop
on Tondc.

05:32.541 --> 05:33.624
You let all those
people--

05:33.834 --> 05:35.334
I am doing
the best I can!

05:35.544 --> 05:37.420
Yeah? Well, it's
not good enough.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.883
Oh, Bellamy.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.515
Ha!

05:51.393 --> 05:52.518
I knew it.

05:52.728 --> 05:56.188
You two are too
scrawny to drill.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.273
Hey.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.566
Ohh! Heh.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.529
It's all right.
She's with us.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.114
Where's your army?

06:05.324 --> 06:07.408
Gone just
like yours.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.619
Say you have a plan.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.372
Not really.
We need to talk to Dante.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.333
Maya says he's
in quarantine.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.584
Clarke!

06:20.964 --> 06:22.423
Thank you.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.762
30 minutes.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.764
And we just changed it.
That can't be right.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.391
Uh, shh--um...

06:32.601 --> 06:34.602
It's her last tank.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.604
Hey. Uh, we'll find
you another one.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.939
All the supplemental
oxygen is on level 5.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.149
Then we have to
get you to level 5.

06:40.359 --> 06:41.650
5 isn't safe
for any of us.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.860
We'll take the
trash chute again.

06:43.070 --> 06:43.986
It will work.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.780
To get in, maybe.
Maya's right.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.740
Every soldier in this
Mountain is there.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.241
We'll never
make it out.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.452
We can do this.
We'll split up.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.746
OK. You
guys go for Dante.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.748
We'll help Maya.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.856
How could you
do this?

07:21.066 --> 07:24.402
I swore loyalty
to this commander.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.196
She left our allies
to be slaughtered.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.489
She dishonors
us all.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.866
And your disobedience
dishonors you.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.827
Why are you here,
Indra?

07:33.036 --> 07:36.372
Because you are also
tree crew.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.875
I can't just
let her die.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.003
Under the terms
of the truce,

07:43.213 --> 07:46.257
the lands surrounding
the Mountain are forbidden.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.259
If you violate this,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.261
Lexa will never
take you back.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.517
Octavia made her choice.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.936
Now you make yours.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.338
- You?
- Thank you.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.844
Sir, lieutenant
Emerson is back.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.095
You're needed
in the dorm.

08:33.305 --> 08:36.682
OK.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.435
Oh! Oh! Aah!

08:39.644 --> 08:41.187
On their knees.

08:41.396 --> 08:45.357
Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

08:45.567 --> 08:46.942
Down.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.083
We take
any losses?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.628
Not as many
as they did, sir.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.962
I'm afraid I'm
the only one left

09:07.172 --> 09:08.214
who's been cured.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.590
Some of the kids
are still missing.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.759
If you'd like, I'll take
a team in hazmats

09:11.968 --> 09:13.844
and sweep
the other levels.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.388
No. No more
wasted lives.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.142
In 48 hours, we will
all be on the ground.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.646
Take off their hoods.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.397
No.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.275
- Dad?
- Nate!

09:28.485 --> 09:29.360
Uh!

09:29.569 --> 09:32.446
Uh! No!
You bastards!

09:37.202 --> 09:39.078
What is wrong
with you people?

09:39.287 --> 09:40.871
Where's my daughter?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.082
She's talking
about Clarke.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.797
I'm sorry it had
to come to this.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.299
Aah! Aah!

09:52.509 --> 09:54.635
Aah! Aah!

09:54.844 --> 09:56.428
Aah!

10:00.976 --> 10:02.851
- He's dead.
- That's OK.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.562
We've already got
all of the marrow.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.772
Guards, we need
another one.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.404
She's next.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.198
No. No. Take me.
Don't touch her!

10:16.408 --> 10:18.867
- Don't touch her!
- Get off.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.620
Don't touch her!
Don't touch her!

10:26.668 --> 10:30.170
Please.
No. Oh!

10:30.380 --> 10:32.423
All right.
Get a strap.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.008
Let's go.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.969
Please. Please don't.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.936
- Huh!
- Yaagh!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.772
Hold her!
Hold her down!

10:48.982 --> 10:51.483
No! Get off me!

10:54.863 --> 10:57.865
Oh!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.242
Please don't.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.493
Uh...

11:16.259 --> 11:17.676
No...

11:17.886 --> 11:22.598
No, no... No!

11:37.697 --> 11:39.823
Hello, Clarke.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.117
Sir, we need
your help again.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.827
It's OK.
I took out the camera

11:44.037 --> 11:45.245
from the junction box
in the hall.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.664
We can talk freely.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.248
No one's watching,
anyway.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.542
Thanks to you,
they're all on level 5.

11:50.752 --> 11:55.172
- You're not.
- No. I'm not.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.049
Please.
We don't have much time.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.634
We need a way to get our people
out of this Mountain

11:58.843 --> 12:00.052
without killing everyone.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.348
He's not
gonna help us.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.394
You cut the power,
risking the lives

12:08.603 --> 12:10.813
of everyone
in this Mountain--

12:11.022 --> 12:13.482
my people, even the ones
who helped you.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.819
We knew they'd be safe
on level 5.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.487
We made sure not to destroy
the turbines

12:18.697 --> 12:20.072
so you could repair them.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.449
We're the good guys here,
not you.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.537
Tell me, if we
released your people

12:26.746 --> 12:30.791
and theirs, what would've
happened to mine?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.879
Can you get us into
the command center?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.006
We need to see what's
happening on level 5.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.925
- No problem.
- Let's go.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.218
You're gonna
help us,

12:41.428 --> 12:42.553
whether you
like it or not.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.433
That's--

12:47.642 --> 12:51.228
uh...

12:52.981 --> 12:56.942
Ah! Ahh!

12:57.152 --> 12:59.069
Ah!

13:07.036 --> 13:09.663
John, let me
help you.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.165
I don't want
anything from you.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.251
Come on.
You're a survivor.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.587
We both are.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.046
Whatever you have
to tell yourself

13:18.256 --> 13:20.591
feel better,
chancellor.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.094
Our destiny...
Is out there, John.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.641
And what about
Craig's destiny?

13:29.851 --> 13:32.394
We sacrificed a few
to save the many.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.322
You know,
you're right.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.784
I am a survivor...

13:48.328 --> 13:51.497
Which is exactly why

13:51.706 --> 13:56.752
I am done
following you.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.962
I'll go my own way.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.590
You can go whichever
the hell way you want.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.717
John. John!

14:03.927 --> 14:06.053
Get the hell
away from me.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.722
You lost too much blood.
Be still!

14:12.685 --> 14:16.021
Did you hear that?
Huh.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.238
Please, whoever you are,
we need your help.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.281
Wait! Wait!

14:28.326 --> 14:29.618
John...

14:29.828 --> 14:33.664
I can't make it.
Just go, all right?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.250
We both know
you want to.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.589
I'll come back
for you, John.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.514
Your promised land sucks!

14:56.563 --> 14:59.106
I told you,
there's no one here.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.149
Sorry if we don't
take your word for it.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.193
Why aren't you with
your people on level 5?

15:03.403 --> 15:07.948
After what I've done,
they can be free. I can't.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.325
Deliverance
comes at a cost.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.870
I bear it so they
don't have to.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.874
It wasn't Cage.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.876
It was your idea
to make the deal

15:19.085 --> 15:20.919
with the grounders.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.883
We're in.
Got it.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.721
It's clear.
He's telling the truth.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.264
OK.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.141
Let's get
the monitors up.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.688
Come on. We have to hurry.
She's out of air.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.899
First, you need
to close the door.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.609
Uh...

15:48.114 --> 15:49.489
- Time to spare.
- Heh heh.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.533
She's safe.
Could we go now?

15:51.743 --> 15:52.910
I'll be OK.

15:53.119 --> 15:53.994
Look.
I'm not leaving you.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.078
Jasper.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.580
She's alive,
but she's not safe.

15:56.789 --> 15:57.706
Cage knows
I helped you guys.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.207
He's on level 5.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.418
So what do we do?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.712
We kill Cage.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.175
I'm in.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.055
I think command
center is live.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.019
Oh, my God.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.438
Is that raven?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.653
Mom.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.407
Tell them
to stop now.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.661
I won't do that.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.581
Emerson.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.171
Carl Emerson,
Mount Weather

16:46.381 --> 16:48.048
security detail,
come in.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.133
Who is this?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.636
You know who it is.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.847
Give the radio
to the president.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.560
They're moving.

17:00.770 --> 17:01.645
Not a problem.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.938
I'll bring it
on main monitor.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.611
This is
president Wallace.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.948
I have your father.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.825
If you don't
let my people go,

17:15.034 --> 17:16.743
I'll kill him.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.745
How do I know
you have him?

17:21.332 --> 17:24.084
Stay the course, Cage.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.420
You won't do it.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.463
You don't know me
very well.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.304
This ends now.
Release my people.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.475
I can't do that.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.729
It would mean the end
of our people, Clarke.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.194
Clarke, we need him.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.780
And I need his son
to believe me.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.160
Don't make me do this.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.383
Dad...

18:13.593 --> 18:16.053
I'll take care
of our people.

18:18.639 --> 18:22.350
None of us has
a choice here, Clarke.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.686
I didn't want this.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.313
Neither did I.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.607
Oh! Uh...

18:49.587 --> 18:51.880
Listen to me
very carefully.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.843
I will not stop
until my people are free.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.304
If you don't let them go...

19:01.641 --> 19:03.809
I will irradiate level 5.

19:15.863 --> 19:16.905
Clarke, on radio:
Cage, listen to me.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.866
I don't want
anyone else to die.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.705
Stop the drilling,
and we can talk.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.959
There must be a way
to get us all out of this.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.379
- Emerson.
- Sir.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.632
They're watching us
from the command center.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.760
Go kill them all.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.179
Yes, sir.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.809
Emerson is
coming for us.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.395
They deactivated my key card.
Can you do that to his?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.647
That one's easy.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.692
Where's he going?

20:07.456 --> 20:09.583
The dorm.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.255
Monty, can you do it?
Can you irradiate the level?

20:15.464 --> 20:16.756
I can do it.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.758
Wait a second, Clarke.
We need to think about this.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.343
There are kids
in there...

20:20.553 --> 20:21.428
I know.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.596
And people
who helped us.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.807
Then please give me
a better idea.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.398
Take that one
off the table.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.151
- Sir, we're not done.
- Now!

20:37.486 --> 20:39.905
- Put her on it.
- No.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.033
No. Please. Hey!
You don't have to do this.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.201
Stop!

20:44.410 --> 20:45.160
There has to be
another way.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.786
- There isn't.
- No.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.874
What have I done?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.626
No one has to die
for bone marrow.

20:52.835 --> 20:56.254
We can donate it.
We can donate it.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.881
Strap her down.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.091
Don't hurt her!

21:00.301 --> 21:01.259
No.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.886
Hey, we can donate it!

21:03.095 --> 21:04.262
That'll
never happen.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.599
I can. I can make it
happen with her help.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.184
We can all survive.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.770
We can't.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.980
Proceed with the drilling.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.777
Steady.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.738
Aah! Aah!

21:21.948 --> 21:23.323
Aah!

21:23.532 --> 21:26.618
Clarke, if we do this,
there is no going back.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.624
Figure it out.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.296
This is
taking too long.

21:38.506 --> 21:39.839
I mean, what
if she got caught?

21:40.049 --> 21:41.383
We'd have heard
something.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.634
Then what if she couldn't
find sergeant Lee or--

21:42.843 --> 21:44.344
I don't know--
the protocol changed?

21:44.553 --> 21:46.388
What if he got caught?

21:46.597 --> 21:48.640
Jasper, a warrior
doesn't worry

21:48.849 --> 21:51.601
about what
he can't control.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.938
Oh, thank God.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.440
Anyone see you?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.067
Lee, put down
the gun.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.443
You didn't say there was
an outsider with you.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.903
She's not
an outsider.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.072
- Yes, she is.
- She's with us.

22:04.282 --> 22:05.699
Cage is in the dorms.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.742
They brought another group in
from the ark, more marrow.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.036
They're not even trying
to fix the dam.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.579
How many soldiers
with Cage?

22:11.789 --> 22:13.164
Uh, 6. Why?

22:13.374 --> 22:15.750
Just get me close.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.586
They'll be happy you
found another 8 doses.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.797
I need a--

22:21.007 --> 22:23.091
aim for the throat.

22:23.301 --> 22:26.469
Slash. Don't stab.
Make it deep.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.809
I hope you know
what you're doing.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.645
Me, too.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.569
- You got this.
- Yeah.

22:50.453 --> 22:53.079
I love you.

Long way from
the ark, huh?

25:25.107 --> 25:26.774
Not my ark.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.693
I didn't have
a view, either.

25:28.903 --> 25:32.697
Still, I wish
I could see it.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.039
Maybe you can.
There's an airlock.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.333
We used it
to hold Emerson.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.752
All we have to do is
get you there, and--

25:45.961 --> 25:47.170
so I could live
in a cell?

25:47.379 --> 25:49.923
At least
you could live.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.514
Outsiders!

25:57.723 --> 25:59.724
No, Octavia! Don't!

26:01.769 --> 26:03.186
No.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.814
Outsiders! Behind us.

26:07.024 --> 26:07.899
Uh!

26:08.108 --> 26:09.150
Ugh! Ugh...

26:13.322 --> 26:16.074
Move! Go, go!

26:16.283 --> 26:17.325
They got
to get out of there.

26:17.535 --> 26:18.493
Maya vie, stop!

26:18.702 --> 26:19.577
Run!

26:19.787 --> 26:20.703
Now!

26:26.502 --> 26:27.585
He's here.

26:30.673 --> 26:33.883
Jasper.
They caught him.

26:34.093 --> 26:34.968
We got
another one.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.512
Jasper!

26:37.721 --> 26:38.930
Why are you
doing this?

26:50.568 --> 26:51.693
Response team
to the mess hall.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.361
Spread out!

26:58.909 --> 27:00.952
Stop. Hands up.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.669
Why are you
stopping?

27:09.878 --> 27:10.878
Because I did it.

27:11.088 --> 27:14.173
All we have to do...
Is pull this.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.758
Hatches and vents
will open,

27:15.968 --> 27:19.304
and the scrubbers reverse,
pulling in outside air

27:24.184 --> 27:25.768
he's gonna
blow the door.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.733
Clarke, we're
out of time.

27:44.747 --> 27:45.830
Down now.

27:47.541 --> 27:52.211
My sister.
My responsibility.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.130
I have to save them.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.554
Together.

28:32.503 --> 28:35.296
- Restrain him.
- Yes, sir.

28:35.506 --> 28:38.758
Don't move!

28:38.967 --> 28:39.884
What is it?

28:40.094 --> 28:41.260
What is--what is this?

28:44.348 --> 28:45.264
Get out of here!

28:53.315 --> 28:54.732
No.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.193
Maya.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.653
Jasper,
come back!

28:58.862 --> 29:00.029
Hey, set us free!

29:17.715 --> 29:19.882
No, no, no, no!

29:20.092 --> 29:21.134
Jasper...

29:24.221 --> 29:26.931
I'm here.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.474
She was innocent.

29:31.854 --> 29:34.731
None of us
is innocent.

29:38.068 --> 29:40.236
No. No.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.449
No.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.829
Oh, God. No.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.350
Let's go get
our people.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.609
- Octavia.
- Octavia, hurry.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.652
Hey, get the keys
from the guard.

30:21.862 --> 30:25.406
I can't
believe this.

30:25.616 --> 30:26.532
Come on.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.742
Hang on.

30:30.913 --> 30:31.913
There!

30:32.122 --> 30:33.623
Get me out
of these things.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.749
OK.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.667
Where's Clarke?

31:08.826 --> 31:11.536
What did you do?

31:12.996 --> 31:15.081
We had no choice.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.083
I was gonna kill Cage.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.543
If you'd just given me
one more minute,

31:18.752 --> 31:20.044
it would've
been over.

31:20.254 --> 31:23.798
Jasper, they
never would've stopped.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.260
We have to go
to the dorm.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.938
How could you
let this happen?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.731
I'm sorry.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.276
Sorry? You're sorry?

31:55.956 --> 31:57.039
All right. OK.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.042
Mom.

Curiouser and curiouser.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.896
Welcome, Thelonious.

39:59.105 --> 40:03.776
I'm glad you made it.
I've been waiting.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.694
Who are you?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.446
My name is Alie.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.035
How do you
know my name?

40:13.244 --> 40:16.663
Thelonious.
It's a good name.

40:16.873 --> 40:18.582
It has
a double meaning.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.334
To the Greeks,
Thelonious

40:20.543 --> 40:22.836
meant lord or ruler.

40:23.046 --> 40:26.757
To the Germans, it meant
tiller of the earth.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.259
Which are you,
I wonder.

40:29.469 --> 40:31.345
You said you
were waiting for me.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.639
For ages,

40:33.848 --> 40:35.808
or so it seems.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.060
Time passes
differently for me.

40:38.269 --> 40:42.147
Very good, Thelonious.

40:42.357 --> 40:44.817
You're as perceptive
as I had hoped.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.152
You're not real.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.405
Define "real."

40:49.614 --> 40:51.323
Your vessel
is carbon-based.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.075
Mine is silicon.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.662
Your thoughts are chemical.
Mine are digital.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.587
And I thought this
was my destination.

41:09.384 --> 41:12.845
It is, Thelonious.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.471
Follow me.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.642
You were meant
to come here.

41:20.061 --> 41:23.105
I realized it when
I received your gift.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.398
My gift?

41:40.707 --> 41:43.750
Thank you for bringing it
down for me, Thelonious.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.465
We have work to do.
