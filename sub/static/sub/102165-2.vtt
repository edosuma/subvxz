No. I know next to nothing

11:33.419 --> 11:35.027
with the family
of Malika Williams.

11:35.103 --> 11:40.198
We have a petition
demanding that she drop
the charges against her.

11:40.275 --> 11:41.533
I'm happy
to pass it along.

11:41.610 --> 11:42.484
We'd like to
hand it to her personally.

11:45.097 --> 11:47.097
Well, I have no idea
when she'll be back.

11:47.099 --> 11:48.114
Then we'll wait.

11:53.029 --> 11:55.605
All right, y'all, this has now
become a sit-in situation.

11:55.607 --> 11:58.458
Get your phones out,
call your folks.

11:58.535 --> 12:00.377
We need
to fill these halls.

12:05.117 --> 12:07.875
Yo, how is this helping
Malika get out of holding?

12:07.953 --> 12:10.136
What's going on
with the bail money?

12:10.213 --> 12:11.897
We're crowd funding it,
and we're almost there.

12:11.974 --> 12:13.899
Look, don't worry.
We got this.

12:13.976 --> 12:16.050
That's what you said
about the hearing,
that it was routine,

12:16.128 --> 12:18.311
and now she's locked up
somewhere.

12:19.965 --> 12:21.965
Look, we're not gonna
leave her in there.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.150
What happens
if you don't raise the bail?

12:24.227 --> 12:25.635
They'll move her to Lynwood,

12:25.637 --> 12:27.637
a women's jail,
till her trial.

12:27.639 --> 12:28.321
But we're not gonna
let that happen.

12:28.398 --> 12:29.364
Oh, this is bullshit.

12:30.900 --> 12:31.491
What the!

12:40.002 --> 12:41.093
Let them do their thing.

12:41.169 --> 12:42.076
They got this.

12:42.154 --> 12:44.421
(phone ringing)

12:45.749 --> 12:46.990
Yo, Isaac.

12:46.992 --> 12:48.100
<i>  Yo, what's going on?</i>

12:48.176 --> 12:50.102
We're here at the DA's office.

12:50.178 --> 12:50.827
They're still trying
to get the bail money.

12:50.829 --> 12:52.420
When you coming in?

12:52.498 --> 12:54.255
<i>  I don't know.</i>
<i>  I'm on my way</i>
<i>  to the airport right now.</i>

12:54.333 --> 12:56.924
<i>  But this is exactly</i>
<i>  the shit I was afraid of.</i>

12:57.002 --> 12:58.426
Tell me about it.

12:58.504 --> 13:00.278
So my client is Shai Faraz,

13:00.355 --> 13:02.022
a 19-year-old college student.

13:02.098 --> 13:03.507
The DA is offering a fine

13:03.509 --> 13:04.858
and 300 hours
of community service.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.451
My client wants
to take the plea.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.695
What is she
being accused of?

13:08.772 --> 13:11.031
So, you were charged
with indecent exposure.

13:11.107 --> 13:14.200
My girlfriend and I
were just fooling around
in my car,

13:14.277 --> 13:15.852
when the cops pulled up.

13:15.854 --> 13:17.521
It's not like
we were exposing ourselves.

13:17.523 --> 13:20.040
Well, since you
don't have any priors,

13:20.116 --> 13:21.541
we can probably get you OR.

13:21.618 --> 13:24.118
It's "out on your
own recognizance."

13:24.196 --> 13:25.695
Uh, we're just gonna need
one of your parents

13:25.697 --> 13:27.622
to show up in court
and vouch for you.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.457
You can't call
my parents.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.384
Why can't she call
her parents?

13:31.461 --> 13:32.869
'Cause they don't know
she's queer.

13:32.871 --> 13:35.889
If my dad finds out
I'm queer, he'll...

13:35.965 --> 13:36.556
I don't even know.
You can't call him.

13:36.633 --> 13:37.965
Please.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.317
Kathleen:
<i>  Well convince her</i>
<i>  she's wrong.</i>

13:40.970 --> 13:44.381
Taking a plea is the first step
towards building a rap sheet.

13:44.383 --> 13:47.325
And real life gets
in the way of fulfilling
community service hours

13:47.402 --> 13:48.660
which then leads
to additional punishment.

13:48.737 --> 13:51.830
I'm sorry,
I can't convince her
to do something

13:51.907 --> 13:52.497
that might get her
kicked out of her house.

13:54.226 --> 13:55.492
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

13:58.321 --> 14:01.456
This isn't the dinner table.
You don't have to wait
to be excused.

14:08.407 --> 14:09.756
Tony:
<i>  How's it going?</i>

14:09.833 --> 14:10.682
So far, not so good.

14:10.759 --> 14:12.834
I hear you.
I got a dud of a case.

14:12.911 --> 14:14.761
Client's failed
to appear three times.

14:14.838 --> 14:17.080
-No way I can get her bail.
-What's her name?

14:17.082 --> 14:18.857
Yvonne Byers.
Why?

14:18.934 --> 14:21.142
You see that woman
in the jean jacket?

14:25.424 --> 14:27.107
Can you do me
a favor?

14:36.435 --> 14:37.117
Hello!

14:39.287 --> 14:40.286
This must be
your first time.

14:42.941 --> 14:43.456
How you holding up?

14:45.034 --> 14:46.534
I'm good.

14:46.612 --> 14:48.336
-No one's good in here.
-Hmm.

14:51.783 --> 14:54.618
Okay, well,
I'm Yvonne.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.136
And this
is Cadence and Brooke.

14:57.973 --> 14:58.388
I don't know her.

15:03.052 --> 15:03.902
You hungry?

15:05.814 --> 15:07.147
I have a candy bar
if you want it.

15:07.223 --> 15:08.131
No, thanks.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.191
-(buzzer buzzes)

15:15.323 --> 15:16.239
It's okay. Take it.

15:17.809 --> 15:18.975
Thank you.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.076
Yeah.

15:22.981 --> 15:26.407
The guards forgot
to take my cell phone, so...

15:26.485 --> 15:27.208
If you need
to send a text...

15:28.654 --> 15:29.261
let me know.

15:37.829 --> 15:38.553
Hey.

15:40.849 --> 15:42.098
Don't worry.

15:44.853 --> 15:45.277
You're not alone.

15:48.674 --> 15:50.023
Malika:
<i>  Her name's Yvonne Byers.</i>

15:50.099 --> 15:51.766
She's got three kids
on her own,

15:51.843 --> 15:53.176
and they keep changing
her dates to appear
at the last minute,

15:53.178 --> 15:54.194
and so she's missed them

15:54.270 --> 15:55.862
because she
doesn't have childcare.

15:55.939 --> 15:58.364
She's afraid that
if she misses work tonight
and gets fired,

15:58.441 --> 15:59.774
she could lose her kids.

15:59.851 --> 16:01.351
And the lawyer
they gave her sucks.

16:01.353 --> 16:03.444
He won't even
try to get her bail.

16:03.522 --> 16:05.205
Is there any way
you can help her?

16:07.693 --> 16:09.467
Uh, I'll take the case,
if you want.

16:09.544 --> 16:10.860
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:10.862 --> 16:11.377
It's all yours.

16:17.719 --> 16:18.259
So then, uh...

16:19.721 --> 16:23.873
who can tell me
about the problems
Mark encountered

16:23.875 --> 16:26.059
with the pass laws
enacted during apartheid?

16:33.885 --> 16:35.643
Okay. So...

16:35.721 --> 16:39.981
He wanted to get a job
to provide for his fam, right?

16:40.058 --> 16:43.835
But he had to get
a job to apply for a pass,

16:43.912 --> 16:47.505
but it was illegal for him
to apply for a pass
without a job.

16:47.582 --> 16:50.342
So, it was pretty messed up.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.418
That's right, Andre. Thank you.

16:52.495 --> 16:54.512
You're welcome, Ms. Moss.

(chuckles) Well, I'm sure
I'm not the only Kathleen Gale

17:32.944 --> 17:35.128
but I appreciate what I hope
is meant as a compliment.

17:35.204 --> 17:39.557
Well, I only meant
that I didn't think
someone of your stature

17:39.634 --> 17:41.301

misdemeanor arraignments.

17:41.377 --> 17:46.139
Well, this is where
I started my career,
and I was feeling nostalgic.

17:46.215 --> 17:47.882
Then please continue.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.351
First, I'd like to apologize
for wasting your time,

17:51.963 --> 17:57.742
a point I tried to make clear
to the nice, young prosecutor.

17:57.819 --> 17:58.526
Two young women
kissing in a car?

18:00.138 --> 18:05.325
Can that really rise
to the charge
of indecent exposure?

18:05.401 --> 18:06.534
More like homophobia.

18:08.330 --> 18:12.239
In any case,
my client has no priors.

honor student,

18:14.152 --> 18:16.169

that she returns to court

18:22.494 --> 18:26.104
if the prosecution wants
to risk provoking
a discrimination lawsuit.

18:26.181 --> 18:27.513

your point, Ms. Gale.

your whole audition thing.

22:10.313 --> 22:11.721
(sighs)

22:11.723 --> 22:13.222
Claire:
<i>  We've already banned</i>
<i>  about 30 users,</i>

22:13.224 --> 22:15.908
and we're monitoring the app
for any more that may show up.

22:15.985 --> 22:18.077
Great. I don't know
how long the sit-in
is going to last,

22:18.154 --> 22:20.079
but keep me updated.
I can work remotely.

22:20.156 --> 22:21.005
(people shouting)

22:21.082 --> 22:22.231
man:
Hey, look!

22:22.233 --> 22:25.251
It's someone from
Brown Lives Matter!

22:25.328 --> 22:27.011
Go back to Mexico,
wetback!

22:27.088 --> 22:28.571
Go back to Mexico.

22:28.573 --> 22:31.090
-Yeah.
-Go back to Mexico.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.351
Hey.
Hey, you okay?

22:33.428 --> 22:34.501
Just keep walking,
all right?

22:34.579 --> 22:40.191
(crowd chanting):
Go back to Mexico.

22:42.587 --> 22:45.088
There's DA Hansen!
It's DA Hansen!

22:45.090 --> 22:48.515
DA Hansen!
DA Hansen!

22:48.593 --> 22:52.704
(crowd chanting):
Four more years.

22:52.780 --> 22:57.542
(crowd chanting):
Law and order.

22:57.619 --> 23:00.453
(crowd chanting):
All Lives Matter.

23:00.529 --> 23:01.713
Let's keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

23:01.789 --> 23:03.122
man:
Don't let the libs
take over America.

23:03.199 --> 23:07.385
(crowd chanting):
All Lives Matter.

23:09.372 --> 23:11.297
(chanting continues)

23:16.638 --> 23:18.554
(crowd chanting)
Law and order.

23:20.792 --> 23:22.475
-(phone ringing)
-Claire: (on phone)<i>  Yeah?</i>

23:22.551 --> 23:25.294
Hey. Uh, did you find out
where these white supremacists
came from?

23:25.296 --> 23:27.721
It looks like
the first users raged
after we banned them.

23:27.799 --> 23:30.650
They started posting
on alt-right message boards,

23:30.726 --> 23:31.743
and directing people
to counter protest.

23:31.819 --> 23:33.319
Using our app?

23:33.396 --> 23:34.320
And they're getting other people
to create ACT-ivism accounts

23:34.397 --> 23:35.972
so they can flood the feeds.

23:35.974 --> 23:39.325
Yeah, as soon as we
shut down one account,
five more pop up.

23:39.402 --> 23:40.251
We need more resources.

23:41.312 --> 23:42.736
It might be time
to tell Evan.

23:42.814 --> 23:45.423
No. We can do this.
Let's just shift
to shadow banning

23:45.500 --> 23:46.907
and then we can rework
the algorithm

23:46.985 --> 23:50.411
so that all the positive users
stay on top of the feed.

23:50.488 --> 23:51.095
Claire:
<i>  Okay. We'll do our best.</i>

23:56.494 --> 23:57.751
We gonna need
all the support
we can get.

23:57.829 --> 23:59.103
Hi.
I'm so sorry.

23:59.180 --> 24:02.665
My team is working
really hard
to find a solution.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.500
Thank you.
I appreciate that,

24:04.502 --> 24:08.613
but they've been harassing
BLM and DPN users
through the chat feature.

24:08.690 --> 24:10.764
Hate speech,
death threats,

24:10.842 --> 24:12.400
images of violence,
lynchings even.

24:13.678 --> 24:15.027
It's vile.

24:15.104 --> 24:16.437
We can't ask our people

24:16.514 --> 24:16.987
to subject themselves
to all this.

24:17.682 --> 24:18.956
I-- I know. Um...

24:19.033 --> 24:22.293
I'm sorry. This will all
get resolved soon, I promise.

24:22.370 --> 24:26.780
Even so, ACT-ivism's now
connected to these groups.

24:26.858 --> 24:29.192
That stench
doesn't just go away.

24:29.194 --> 24:30.042
It might be too late.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.806
Good news.
Good news, y'all.

24:34.882 --> 24:37.308
We raised the money,
got the bail.

24:37.385 --> 24:40.052
Our lawyer is on her way
to post it right now

24:40.129 --> 24:41.462
and bring Malika back.

24:41.539 --> 24:43.389
(all cheering)

24:43.466 --> 24:45.391
-That's all right.
-Yeah!

24:45.468 --> 24:47.652
But we ain't goin' nowhere

24:47.729 --> 24:49.636
until the DA comes out,
takes our petition,

24:49.714 --> 24:53.149
and drops the charges
against Malika altogether.

24:55.644 --> 24:57.720
-Shut it down!
-all: Shut it down!

24:57.722 --> 24:59.889
-Shut it down!
-all: Shut it down!

24:59.891 --> 25:01.240
-Melina: Shut it down!
-all: Shut it down!

25:16.090 --> 25:17.331
(clears throat)

25:17.408 --> 25:19.341
Uh, Your Honor,
the crime--

25:22.247 --> 25:24.171
I mean, the alleged crime...

25:24.249 --> 25:26.023
is victimless.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.516
And Yvonne--

25:29.512 --> 25:32.846
I'm sorry, Ms. Byers,
my client...

25:32.924 --> 25:34.273
is a mother.

25:34.350 --> 25:36.534
A very caring mother--

25:36.611 --> 25:38.319
Who has four bench warrants.

25:39.781 --> 25:41.355
The DA
is well within her rights

25:41.432 --> 25:44.375
to ask to remand her
into custody
while she awaits trail.

25:46.437 --> 25:51.107
But to remand someone
into custody for this kind of
alleged crime, it's, uh...

25:51.109 --> 25:56.629
cruel and unusual--
(clears throat)

25:56.705 --> 25:58.205
Impulse Buy is
crashing and burning.

25:58.283 --> 26:01.801
Uh, sorry, Your Honor...

26:01.877 --> 26:05.212
Your Honor,
the charges
against my client,

26:05.290 --> 26:09.400
they barely constitute
a complete sentence,
much less a provable charge.

26:09.477 --> 26:12.353
OR is the only fair outcome,
Judge.

26:17.468 --> 26:19.802
I don't recognize you.

26:19.804 --> 26:21.579
You've been
in my courtroom before?

26:21.656 --> 26:24.240
No. Or, uh,
any courtroom, actually.

26:25.568 --> 26:26.492
Then you should act like it.

26:27.979 --> 26:30.070
You don't do your clients
any favors

26:30.148 --> 26:30.913
by pretending
you know what you're doing.

26:32.074 --> 26:35.151
Defense's request
for OR is denied.

26:35.153 --> 26:37.378
Bail is set at $1,000.

26:42.751 --> 26:45.052
So, I have an idea,
but you need to trust me.

26:51.927 --> 26:52.393
Take a breath.

26:56.674 --> 26:57.356
(exhales)

26:59.026 --> 27:00.117
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:02.530 --> 27:06.123
I'm sorry, um,
this is actually my first ever
argument in a courtroom.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.108
It's quite all right.

27:08.186 --> 27:10.202
You were making
an Eighth Amendment argument

27:10.279 --> 27:11.871
against cruel
and unusual punishment,
I believe.

27:11.947 --> 27:16.859
Callie: Yes, uh,
what I was trying
to say was...

27:16.861 --> 27:20.363
This is a case
about unpaid parking tickets.

27:20.365 --> 27:22.623
There's no victim,
no one suffers.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.958
But Ms. Byers' family
will suffer,

27:25.036 --> 27:26.719
if she's remanded.

27:26.795 --> 27:32.224
Um, I... went through
the foster care system
myself.

27:32.301 --> 27:34.710
So, I know first-hand

27:34.712 --> 27:36.654
kids are better off
with their mothers.

27:36.731 --> 27:38.714
And if she's released
on recognizance,

27:38.716 --> 27:40.716
she will show up for court
next time.

27:40.718 --> 27:44.486
Still, everything in this file
tells me that your client
should be remanded.

27:47.816 --> 27:48.449
That said...

27:49.894 --> 27:53.562
I'm going to set bail at $500.

27:53.564 --> 27:55.006
It's the best I can do,
counselor.

27:55.082 --> 27:55.497
Thank you, Your Honor.

27:59.587 --> 28:00.252
(no audio)

28:03.424 --> 28:04.924
How the hell
she pull that off?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.351
Seems a little humility
goes a long way
with this judge.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.337
Hey, at least we got bail.

28:10.415 --> 28:14.183
And I appreciate that,
but no way I can get $500.

28:20.015 --> 28:22.149
Your bail's taken care of.
You can go get processed.

28:26.764 --> 28:28.039
We got all the money.

28:32.103 --> 28:34.378
Where's Malika?

28:34.455 --> 28:36.455
Malika asked us
to use the funds

28:36.532 --> 28:38.791
to bail out some
of the other women
she's in holding with

28:38.867 --> 28:41.034
who, she believes,
need it more than she does.

28:41.112 --> 28:41.502
That's dope.

28:42.947 --> 28:45.798
Yo, you think it's dope
my sister's going to jail?

28:45.874 --> 28:47.207
Mmm. Okay.

28:47.285 --> 28:51.228
Terrorists!
Lock Malika up!
Lock her up!

28:51.305 --> 28:53.898
(man chanting):
Lock her up!

28:53.975 --> 28:56.183
-No, lock you up!
-Go on, get outta here!

28:57.386 --> 28:58.961
Yo, get outta here!

28:58.963 --> 29:01.480
Any more chaos,
we start arresting folks.

29:03.634 --> 29:08.529
(man chanting):
Lock her up.

29:10.733 --> 29:13.242
-You got that?
-Yeah, and a lot more too.

29:17.498 --> 29:19.924
Thank you.
I'll be praying for you.

29:20.001 --> 29:22.167
I'll be okay.
Your kids all need you.

29:24.155 --> 29:26.005
-Thanks.
-Yeah, of course.

30:00.949 --> 30:02.207
I thought we were meeting
at the restaurant.

30:06.197 --> 30:07.471
Oh, I was gonna
bring those for you.

30:09.033 --> 30:11.291
Is that okay?

30:11.369 --> 30:13.093
Yes, that's... very okay.

30:14.372 --> 30:15.312
They're roses.

30:17.224 --> 30:18.265
Yeah, I-- I can see that.

30:19.802 --> 30:21.485
Wait, why aren't you
at your friend's comedy show?

30:25.140 --> 30:25.606
There's a problem.

30:26.717 --> 30:29.318

We have to shut it down.

30:43.067 --> 30:45.492
Hey! Why aren't you

30:45.570 --> 30:46.993

30:47.071 --> 30:49.513
I just can't not be here

30:49.590 --> 30:51.090

your best friend.

don't blame me if she's not,

but give it up
for Alice Kwan!

31:23.866 --> 31:25.774
Go on! Seriously.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.610
Seriously, everyone
needs to laugh right now.

-Do it right here?
-Yeah.

31:29.947 --> 31:32.038
(all laughing)

31:32.116 --> 31:34.133
I had two Hot Pockets
right before this.

31:47.648 --> 31:51.133
Uh, this is the biggest hallway
I've ever played.

31:51.135 --> 31:52.468
That's for sure.

31:52.470 --> 31:53.986
Yeah, one for the books!

31:54.062 --> 31:56.730
Lots of people, crowded space.
Reminds me of home.

31:56.807 --> 31:58.532
Not China, the Coterie.

32:00.903 --> 32:03.254
I live in an
"intentional community,"

32:03.330 --> 32:04.830
which, for the uninitiated,

32:04.907 --> 32:07.833
translates to
"millennial clown car."

32:07.910 --> 32:10.669
I'm the manager,
so I drive the car.

32:10.746 --> 32:14.265
Um, it's a jalopy
that runs on sexual tension
and bad decisions.

32:14.341 --> 32:15.916
Which we have plenty of.

32:15.993 --> 32:16.550
Beep-beep.

32:23.167 --> 32:23.515
We can't shut it down.

32:24.852 --> 32:25.392
But we have to.

32:27.763 --> 32:32.675
When you create a product,
you can't control who uses it.

32:32.677 --> 32:33.600
We're a platform.
We're not a media company.

32:33.678 --> 32:34.952
And we're not political.

32:35.029 --> 32:38.956
Our job is to create ways
for people to communicate,

32:39.033 --> 32:41.850
but, you know,
we can't control
what they say.

32:41.852 --> 32:44.945
Nor should we,
on either side.

32:45.022 --> 32:47.856
Okay, but this isn't
a "both sides" issue.

32:47.858 --> 32:49.616
There's clearly
a right and wrong.

32:49.694 --> 32:51.135
And what about bad publicity?

32:59.537 --> 33:03.797
If we shut it down,
the publicity would be worse.

33:03.874 --> 33:05.708
We're about to launch
a new social network app.

33:05.710 --> 33:10.470
We can't be seen
catering to only those users
whose politics we agree with.

33:10.548 --> 33:12.731
That would guarantee failure.

33:12.808 --> 33:16.385
Okay, so we just give
these bigots an online home

33:16.387 --> 33:17.277
because it's good for business?

33:20.983 --> 33:22.741
I have hundreds of employees
to think about.

33:22.818 --> 33:25.911
Their families,
my responsibility to them.

what's good for business.

Yeah.

One of the students

Look, I have met with many,
let's say, well-meaning
teachers in my day.

to sign Andre up

40:04.628 --> 40:06.628
for this diversion program
in the first place.

40:06.630 --> 40:10.966
It sounded like real action,
something that gave him
discipline and structure.

40:10.968 --> 40:12.909
But now that I know more,
it's just harassment.

40:12.986 --> 40:15.487

so-called infractions.
