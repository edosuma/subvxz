WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.664
So, does your family's business

00:03.689 --> 00:05.578
only manufacture corrugated cardboard?

00:05.603 --> 00:07.414
Or do they also make binder's board,

00:07.439 --> 00:09.269
counterboard, solid bleached board...

00:09.294 --> 00:12.272
You Googled "types of cardboard"
before this, didn't you?

00:12.297 --> 00:14.256
I make time for the things I care about.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.570
Same. That's why I spent
all day with you.

00:17.532 --> 00:19.070
I had a really nice time.

00:19.071 --> 00:20.320
See you at school, Ollie.

00:24.491 --> 00:26.900
So, things are getting
pretty serious, "Ollie."

00:26.901 --> 00:28.360
Call me that again and we start looking

00:28.361 --> 00:30.190
for retirement homes this weekend.

00:30.191 --> 00:32.320
But, yeah. She's great.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.570
- Nice, smart...
- And rich.

00:34.571 --> 00:35.990
Yeah, but they're "make their kids drive

00:35.991 --> 00:38.150
old Mercedes to keep them
grounded" rich.

00:38.151 --> 00:40.401
Not my favorite kind of rich,
but I still like her.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.889
Is all this stuff for Anna-Kat's
playdate this weekend?

00:43.914 --> 00:45.669
Yeah. These are popular girls.

00:45.694 --> 00:47.130
They can make Anna-Kat.

00:47.155 --> 00:49.333
This playdate has to be amazing.

00:49.334 --> 00:50.793
I'm sure they're gonna have fun.

00:50.794 --> 00:52.453
Fun isn't enough.

00:52.454 --> 00:55.583
It has to be the best playdate
of their lives.

00:55.584 --> 00:56.953
I'm going to buy goodie bags.

00:56.954 --> 00:58.743
It doesn't matter how rich a kid is.

00:58.744 --> 01:00.663
You put 4 bucks of crap in a little bag,

01:00.664 --> 01:02.833
they go nuts.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.043
I know I'm grounded, but can
I go to Trip's game tomorrow?

01:05.044 --> 01:06.543
I don't know. Is Trip's game tomorrow

01:06.544 --> 01:07.833
two weeks in the future,

01:07.834 --> 01:09.163
where you're not grounded anymore?

01:09.164 --> 01:11.293
- Um...
- No, you can't go.

01:11.294 --> 01:13.293
Why can't you punish me
when I have nothing going on?

01:13.294 --> 01:15.873
You think I like doing this?

01:15.874 --> 01:17.453
Well, I do like doing this.

01:17.454 --> 01:18.942
But I also have to.

01:18.967 --> 01:20.731
It's my responsibility as a parent.

01:20.756 --> 01:22.203
You'll understand someday.

01:22.204 --> 01:25.059
Fine-ah!

01:25.084 --> 01:27.123
Why is she grounded?

01:27.124 --> 01:29.953
Her back-talk is out of control.

01:29.954 --> 01:32.083
Don't forget to return
your library books today.

01:32.084 --> 01:33.243
You have your own bedroom!

01:33.244 --> 01:34.834
Why do you have to live up my ass?!

01:36.244 --> 01:38.293
It's gonna be a hell of a weekend...

01:38.294 --> 01:40.123
the kind that can destroy a parent.

01:40.124 --> 01:41.333
But I've got it.

01:41.334 --> 01:44.123
That's why they pay me
the big imaginary bucks.

01:47.164 --> 01:48.833
Are you okay? You don't look so hot.

01:48.834 --> 01:51.583
I feel a little... off.

01:51.584 --> 01:52.913
I'll be fine.

01:52.914 --> 01:54.203
Have to be.

01:54.204 --> 01:55.583
There's nothing to worry about.

01:58.204 --> 02:00.302
You couldn't throw up
on the garbage disposal side?

02:00.327 --> 02:02.014
Ugh.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.895

<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:07.124 --> 02:08.793
I'm sick.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.543
And I am in charge of
Anna-Kat's playdate tomorrow.

02:11.544 --> 02:13.083
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

02:13.084 --> 02:14.163
<i>So, ask Greg.</i>

02:14.164 --> 02:15.413
He has a work thing.

02:15.414 --> 02:17.503
<i>Mm. You just let us know what you need.</i>

02:17.504 --> 02:19.913
Oh, really? What do you guys
have going on tomorrow?

02:19.914 --> 02:23.413
<i>- Oh, um, well, we're going to a...
- We're...</i>

02:23.414 --> 02:26.203
Guys, you there?

02:26.204 --> 02:28.583
Guys, I know the screen didn't freeze.

02:28.584 --> 02:30.623
Everyone is moving around you.

02:30.624 --> 02:32.743
The waiter is filling your coffee.

02:32.744 --> 02:34.543
Ugh, fine.

02:34.544 --> 02:36.543
I wouldn't do it for you, either.

02:36.544 --> 02:37.915
<i>Bye, Katie. We love you.</i>

02:37.940 --> 02:39.583
<i>- Feel better!
- Mwah.</i>

02:39.584 --> 02:41.453
- Whoa.
- What whoa?

02:41.454 --> 02:43.163
It's none of your concern.

02:43.164 --> 02:47.163
You seem to be confusing me with
someone you can say that to.

02:49.244 --> 02:50.953
Gina Tuscadero?

02:50.954 --> 02:54.003
"Home from Deervale. Want to hang?"

02:54.004 --> 02:57.003
You are not really thinking
of seeing her, are you?

02:57.004 --> 02:58.453
I don't know. Mm.

02:58.454 --> 02:59.913
She broke your heart.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.743
You laid curled up on this couch

03:01.744 --> 03:03.663
for two months moaning about it.

03:03.664 --> 03:05.703
It was pretty pathetic.

03:05.704 --> 03:07.503
You did the exact same thing
when McDreamy

03:07.504 --> 03:08.703
was killed off "Grey's."

03:08.704 --> 03:12.163
Someone died, Oliver.

03:12.164 --> 03:14.293
Besides, now you're seeing Brie,

03:14.294 --> 03:16.203
who hasn't lied to your face,
broken your heart,

03:16.204 --> 03:17.913
and made you cry so hard, you did this.

03:19.744 --> 03:21.834
You promised you'd never
bring that up again.

03:23.334 --> 03:24.543
Just to be clear,

03:24.544 --> 03:26.503
Gina is not allowed in this house.

03:26.504 --> 03:28.293
I am adding her to the banned list,

03:28.294 --> 03:30.833
along with gluten-free
Girl Scout cookies.

03:30.834 --> 03:32.624
I mean, this is America, isn't it?

03:33.834 --> 03:35.543
I made you some soup.

03:35.544 --> 03:36.544
How you feeling?

03:36.545 --> 03:37.873
- Not great.
- Mm.

03:37.874 --> 03:40.203
I have to keep an eye
on Oliver and Taylor

03:40.204 --> 03:42.543
- and oversee Anna-Kat's playdate.
- Mm.

03:42.544 --> 03:44.743
How's your work thing?

03:44.744 --> 03:47.335
I have to go see my assistant's
stand-up comedy show.

03:48.874 --> 03:50.163
That's your big work thing?

03:50.164 --> 03:51.833
This is my chance
to finally get rid of him.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.663
If Grant makes it in comedy,
he'll quit for sure.

03:53.664 --> 03:55.663
Wouldn't it be easier just to fire him?

03:55.664 --> 03:57.865
Trust me, it's easier to nurture
his passion for stand-up.

03:57.890 --> 03:58.960
You know him.

03:58.985 --> 04:01.333
He's kind of unstable
and obsessed with me.

04:01.334 --> 04:02.841
The other day, right as we were
getting off the phone,

04:02.866 --> 04:03.874
he said, "I love you."

04:03.899 --> 04:06.413
Caught me by surprise,
so I said, "I love you, too."

04:06.414 --> 04:07.873
Now he's got me saying it every time.

04:12.874 --> 04:14.083
Grant.

04:18.004 --> 04:19.413
About your showcase...

04:19.414 --> 04:21.003
I'm so glad you're coming.

04:21.004 --> 04:22.543
And I can't wait for our post-show hug,

04:22.544 --> 04:24.204
which I think will go
something like this.

04:25.744 --> 04:26.913
Mm.

04:26.914 --> 04:28.913
Let's not get carried away.

04:28.914 --> 04:30.873
Maybe you're right.

04:30.874 --> 04:32.453
Is my dream of fame a mistake?

04:32.454 --> 04:34.083
You know what?

04:34.084 --> 04:35.932
I'll just stay here with you
in this office, forever.

04:35.957 --> 04:38.543
No. No, no, uh, no. You love comedy.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.663
Let's make a time capsule, right now,

04:40.664 --> 04:43.623
to commemorate the day we decided
to grow old together.

04:43.624 --> 04:44.913
I'll put in my undershirt.

04:44.914 --> 04:45.914
Stop.

04:45.915 --> 04:46.953
You need this.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.203
You need to get up on that stage.

04:49.204 --> 04:50.913
And then you need to get up
on other stages...

04:50.914 --> 04:54.043
stages far away from this university.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.293
And laughter is the universal language,

04:56.294 --> 04:58.623
so you could go anywhere... like Russia.

04:58.624 --> 05:01.123
You could go to Russia.

05:01.124 --> 05:03.124
Thank you for your support,
Professor Otto.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.163
Oh.

05:07.164 --> 05:09.083
I need a ride. I can't drive.

05:09.084 --> 05:11.624
My peripheral vision
is not what it used to be.

05:12.504 --> 05:14.293
Plus, I have three DUIs.

05:18.544 --> 05:20.543
So, you still have to get
the goodie bags

05:20.544 --> 05:22.003
for Anna-Kat's playdate.

05:22.004 --> 05:24.373
Actually, I couldn't cancel on Grant.

05:24.374 --> 05:26.453
I wanted to tell you last night,
but you were sleeping.

05:26.454 --> 05:28.913
Well, I can't reschedule
this playdate...

05:28.914 --> 05:30.833
it took a month to get it on the books.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.453
Don't worry... I found someone
who can sub in for you.

05:32.454 --> 05:33.583
Katie?

05:33.584 --> 05:36.243
Please tell me
it's anyone but my mother.

05:36.244 --> 05:38.623
Tell me it's the guy who sells
pickles by the off-ramp.

05:38.624 --> 05:39.743
Oh, come on.

05:39.744 --> 05:40.913
When you're under the weather,

05:40.914 --> 05:43.374
there's nothing better than a mom.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.543
Hi, honey.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.373
Ew! You're sick.

05:47.794 --> 05:49.293
W-Why didn't you tell me she was sick?

05:55.754 --> 05:57.849
Brought you some ginger ale.

05:57.874 --> 05:59.703
Ah.

05:59.704 --> 06:01.793
How are things with Dad?

06:01.794 --> 06:02.953
Good, good.

06:02.954 --> 06:04.913
We cuddle on the couch every night.

06:04.914 --> 06:06.703
Oh, that's nice.

06:06.704 --> 06:08.663
Actually, we don't have any choice.

06:08.664 --> 06:10.743
The apartment is so small
that there's only room

06:10.744 --> 06:12.503
for the one stupid love seat.

06:12.504 --> 06:15.243
I need to show you the stuff
for Anna-Kat's playdate.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.333
There's a binder.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.373
- Seriously?
- Mom, please.

06:18.374 --> 06:20.333
I need you not to suck at this.

06:20.334 --> 06:21.623
Oh, relax.

06:21.624 --> 06:23.703
- I raised you, didn't I?
- Not really.

06:23.704 --> 06:25.243
You were never home.

06:25.244 --> 06:27.203
I was alone while
you were traveling around,

06:27.204 --> 06:28.873
boozing it up at airport bars.

06:28.874 --> 06:31.293
Ah, good times, good times.

06:31.294 --> 06:32.453
Everything's in the binder.

06:32.454 --> 06:36.703
- Please just follow the instructions.
- It's a playdate.

06:36.704 --> 06:38.503
God, parents these days.

06:38.504 --> 06:41.243
They're... They're just
so uptight about everything.

06:41.244 --> 06:43.243
Secondhand smoke made you
the woman you are.

06:43.244 --> 06:45.543
This is my kid.

06:45.544 --> 06:47.953
And I need you to do it my way.

06:47.954 --> 06:49.243
And I need you to make sure

06:49.244 --> 06:51.003
that Taylor doesn't leave the house.

06:51.004 --> 06:53.793
And keep Oliver away
from his ex-girlfriend Gina.

06:53.794 --> 06:55.163
Got it.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.453
And you need to relax.

06:57.454 --> 06:59.731
Just take it easy.

06:59.756 --> 07:01.333
Uh, here.

07:01.334 --> 07:02.453
Just take this.

07:02.454 --> 07:03.544
Hm.

07:05.664 --> 07:07.373
It's got a bit of a bite to it,

07:07.374 --> 07:09.873
so probably best if you
don't try to get out of bed.

07:09.874 --> 07:12.083
A bite? What did you give me?

07:12.084 --> 07:15.703
Uh, it's off-label, uh, flu medication.

07:15.704 --> 07:17.793
Yeah, I take them whenever
I'm feeling a little run down.

07:17.794 --> 07:19.873
But most people use it

07:19.874 --> 07:22.003
to sedate gorillas for transport.

07:22.004 --> 07:23.873
Wait! The goodie bags.

07:23.874 --> 07:25.663
You got to get them from the store.

07:25.664 --> 07:27.663
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- It has to happen!

07:27.664 --> 07:30.083
They are the most impor...

07:30.084 --> 07:32.003
They're the... the...

07:32.004 --> 07:33.743
Wha...

07:33.744 --> 07:36.413
What is happening?

07:36.414 --> 07:39.793
Yeah, that pill kicks in
pretty quick, huh?

07:39.794 --> 07:41.123
Oh, yeah. You know, I sanded

07:41.124 --> 07:43.953
the slow-down coating off of them.

07:43.954 --> 07:45.543
Oh.

07:45.544 --> 07:46.913
Must be the girls.

07:46.914 --> 07:48.873
Just a...

07:48.874 --> 07:50.293
Just a...

07:50.294 --> 07:51.413
Oh.

07:51.414 --> 07:54.413
Those pills are a fun ride.

07:54.414 --> 07:56.083
I wish I could join you.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.123
Mnh.

07:58.834 --> 08:01.243
Did my mom give you instructions?

08:01.244 --> 08:02.503
Who can say?

08:02.504 --> 08:03.873
Well, what should we do?

08:03.874 --> 08:05.953
Go play outside now.

08:05.954 --> 08:07.334
Good girls. Here we go.

08:08.374 --> 08:10.953
Hey, did Mom say anything about us?

08:10.954 --> 08:13.833
Uh, your mom isn't saying anything.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.413
I gave her kind of a strong pill.

08:16.414 --> 08:18.003
Yeah, uh, the FDA banned it

08:18.004 --> 08:20.123
after some people who took it
forgot math.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.743
Not just how to do it,

08:21.744 --> 08:23.624
but... what it is.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.620
Oh.

08:26.621 --> 08:28.540
This is interesting.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.080
Uh, why don't you two watch each other?

08:31.081 --> 08:32.450
I'll be in the office.

08:32.451 --> 08:34.740
Watch each other, huh?

08:34.741 --> 08:36.539
Hey, do I have your permission
to invite Gina over?

08:36.541 --> 08:38.120
Absolutely.

08:38.121 --> 08:39.370
Do I have your permission
to go to Trip's game?

08:39.371 --> 08:40.409
By all means.

08:40.410 --> 08:42.280
Wow. Parenting is so easy.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.160
All you got to do is
throw in a "Greeeeg!"

08:45.161 --> 08:46.990
Yes, honey. I'm sorry, honey.

08:52.951 --> 08:56.240
Mom? Where do you think you're going?

08:56.241 --> 08:57.700
Party store.

08:57.701 --> 09:00.080
I gotta get "goobie" bags.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.990
You're in no condition to be driving.

09:01.991 --> 09:03.450
You're sick.

09:03.451 --> 09:05.660
And, more importantly,
Grandma's got you rollin' hard.

09:05.661 --> 09:08.910
- Whatever.
- Don't you "whatever" me!

09:08.911 --> 09:10.540
I am taking these,
you're going back to bed,

09:10.541 --> 09:11.541
and that's that.

09:11.542 --> 09:14.081
No, I'm fine to drive.

09:15.281 --> 09:16.580
Get off of me.

09:16.581 --> 09:18.240
- I said, get off!
- Fine!

09:18.241 --> 09:19.410
Ugh!

09:23.201 --> 09:25.410
Ah! "What's the deal with trail mix?

09:25.411 --> 09:27.700
It's just M&M's that are hard to get to,

09:27.701 --> 09:28.990
ammiright?"

09:28.991 --> 09:30.280
You just need to be yourself up there.

09:30.281 --> 09:31.660
Forget about the note cards.

09:31.661 --> 09:32.854
- Forget the cards. Forget the cards.
- Thank you.

09:32.879 --> 09:35.026
Just forget the cards. Forget the cards.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.950
Tell stories about your life.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.450
That's what people can relate to.

09:38.451 --> 09:39.740
Come from a place of truth.

09:39.741 --> 09:41.081
Truth. Okay.

09:42.371 --> 09:43.660
Knock, knock.

09:43.661 --> 09:44.661
Who's there?

09:44.662 --> 09:46.200
I have IBS.

09:46.201 --> 09:49.240
It's extremely painful and inconvenient.

09:50.621 --> 09:51.990
Why aren't you laughing?

09:58.621 --> 09:59.621
Mm.

10:00.911 --> 10:02.870
Dan!

10:02.871 --> 10:05.700
How lucky that I was in town
when you texted.

10:05.701 --> 10:07.910
Oh, and I see you, uh, brought...

10:07.911 --> 10:09.950
- Mittens. You remember Mittens.
- Mittens, yeah.

10:09.951 --> 10:11.410
I've been wanting to talk to you.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.160
So much has happened
since you came to see me.

10:14.161 --> 10:17.330
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry to see
about your parents on Facebook.

10:17.331 --> 10:20.240
- Yeah. One went right after the other.
- Mm.

10:20.241 --> 10:22.624
They left all the money
to the cats and not me.

10:22.649 --> 10:23.910
Oh?

10:23.911 --> 10:25.410
Of course, they also
made me the executor,

10:25.411 --> 10:26.910
so joke's on them.

10:26.911 --> 10:29.156
- Oh, right.
- Cats just bought a new place in Aspen.

10:30.220 --> 10:31.740
Grandma?

10:31.741 --> 10:33.990
Oh, uh, Dan, why don't you
just wait in my office

10:33.991 --> 10:35.780
while I get rid of the nightlight crew?

10:37.371 --> 10:38.620
What are you three doing here?

10:38.621 --> 10:39.990
We got cold.

10:39.991 --> 10:42.200
And there aren't any good toys.

10:42.201 --> 10:45.276
There are sticks.
Hit each other with sticks.

10:45.831 --> 10:48.280
Grandma, I don't think
the playdate's going great.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.580
Can we do something else?

10:49.581 --> 10:50.950
How about a movie?

10:50.951 --> 10:52.990
I only get 22 minutes of screen time.

10:52.991 --> 10:55.080
Well, that is just ridiculous.

10:55.081 --> 10:56.620
Now, growing girls your age

10:56.621 --> 10:58.370
need at least four hours of TV a day.

10:58.371 --> 10:59.410
Come on. Let's go.

11:03.781 --> 11:05.990
- How about "Cinderella"?
- I've seen it.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.830
- "Beauty and the Beast"?
- Seen it.

11:07.831 --> 11:08.910
Oh.

11:08.911 --> 11:10.700
Here's a cartoon with a talking hot dog.

11:10.701 --> 11:11.883
Have you seen that?

11:11.908 --> 11:14.120
- No.
- I'm a vegan, but okay.

11:14.121 --> 11:16.910
Great. Enjoy.

11:16.911 --> 11:18.950
You need to get some sleep.

11:18.951 --> 11:20.072
So, when you wake up from your nap,

11:20.097 --> 11:21.910
I'm gonna make you drink a lot of water.

11:21.911 --> 11:24.850
I'm still cold.

11:30.541 --> 11:33.040
Okay. Here you go.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.490
Mm. That's better.

11:35.491 --> 11:38.240
Okay. Well, you get some rest now.

11:38.241 --> 11:39.701
It's too hot!

11:40.781 --> 11:43.040
It's not too hot.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.330
And I have other things to do
besides taking care of you!

11:45.331 --> 11:47.370
I mean, when does my life begin?!

11:47.371 --> 11:49.031
You're mean.

11:52.741 --> 11:55.660
My grandma always said,
"Husbands are like potato chips.

11:55.661 --> 11:57.781
You can't have just one."

12:01.831 --> 12:04.491
Oh, fudge.

12:06.541 --> 12:08.580
Hey.

12:08.581 --> 12:10.410
Truth.

12:10.411 --> 12:11.741
Truth.

12:14.621 --> 12:18.280
Anyone else out here
have a terrible boss?

12:18.281 --> 12:19.330
Yeah.

12:19.331 --> 12:21.330
Mine's the worst.

12:21.331 --> 12:23.330
Guy's crazy about elbow patches.

12:23.331 --> 12:26.240
I swear he even has them on his pajamas.

12:26.241 --> 12:29.240
We get it. You're a professor,
you douche-rocket.

12:33.371 --> 12:35.410
You should see his browser history.

12:35.411 --> 12:37.490
"Why do I have to pee so much at night?"

12:37.491 --> 12:39.830
"How many carbs are in tiramisu?"

12:39.831 --> 12:41.410
"Why is my wife mad at me?"

12:43.281 --> 12:46.160
And he is so unappreciative.

12:46.161 --> 12:48.580
Every morning,
I take a sip of his coffee

12:48.581 --> 12:50.990
just to make sure it's warm
enough before I give it to him.

12:50.991 --> 12:52.410
Never a "thank you."

12:53.951 --> 12:55.240
It's like, uh, maybe I should fill it up

12:55.241 --> 12:58.280
with elbow patches, you douche-rocket?

12:58.281 --> 12:59.281
Yeah!

13:02.371 --> 13:04.040
Deervale looks nice.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.120
And to be honest, it's not that great.

13:06.121 --> 13:07.830
It's really hard
not being the best dancer.

13:07.831 --> 13:09.370
You were right.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.741
I shouldn't have left.

13:13.491 --> 13:15.580
I really miss you.

13:17.911 --> 13:19.330
You have a cat?

13:19.331 --> 13:20.450
Maybe.

13:20.451 --> 13:21.910
This place is crazy.

13:21.911 --> 13:24.450
We had a pig for a while.

13:24.451 --> 13:28.200
To Christmas in Cabo
and New Year's in Aspen.

13:28.201 --> 13:30.540
It's always a good time.

13:30.541 --> 13:32.080
Mittens hates the snow, though.

13:32.081 --> 13:34.830
And she absolutely refuses to wear hats.

13:34.831 --> 13:37.040
She much prefers our
summer house in the Hamptons.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.870
Oh, well, I get that.

13:38.871 --> 13:41.620
I mean, the beach is like
one giant litter box.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.660
- That's what she says!
- Mm.

13:42.661 --> 13:44.120
I'm glad I reached out.

13:44.121 --> 13:47.240
Seeing you again after all these years

13:47.241 --> 13:49.450
has me wondering what my life
would've been like

13:49.451 --> 13:52.080
had we not broken up in high school.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.040
- Really?
- Mm.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.040
I-I never thought about that.

13:57.041 --> 14:01.910
You've obviously moved on,
so I shouldn't say this, but...

14:01.911 --> 14:04.540
- you are gorgeous, Kathryn.
- Mm.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.830
And Mittens could really use
a mother figure.

14:06.831 --> 14:08.120
Go on.

14:08.121 --> 14:10.621
- She wakes up meowing in the night...
- No, no. I-I meant about me.

14:12.121 --> 14:14.240
Why is there a cat in our house?

14:14.241 --> 14:16.200
She's looking for a new mommy.

14:16.201 --> 14:17.910
I'm in the running.

14:20.951 --> 14:22.370
I can't believe you scored a touchdown

14:22.371 --> 14:24.200
and I wasn't there to cheer you on.

14:24.201 --> 14:26.040
<i>I'll put my phone in my helmet
for the second half</i>

14:26.041 --> 14:28.160
<i>so it feels like you're here with me.</i>

14:28.161 --> 14:30.370
Okay, hold on. I just need
to check on my mom.

14:35.951 --> 14:37.370
She's gone!

14:37.371 --> 14:39.040
She must've snuck out
to get goodie bags.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.620
<i>No way.</i>

14:40.621 --> 14:42.450
<i>Ooh, ooh! Dibs on one of those
little parachute guys!</i>

14:46.131 --> 14:47.824
I can't believe my mom snuck out!

14:47.849 --> 14:50.246
<i>27, 32, hike!</i>

14:50.271 --> 14:51.830
<i>Uh-oh, Mike missed his block.</i>

14:53.871 --> 14:55.660
Ohh.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.660
Ah. The keys are still here.

15:01.661 --> 15:04.160
But if she didn't take the car,
then how did she...

15:09.991 --> 15:12.540
Get out of my way! I need "doogie" bags!

15:17.871 --> 15:19.414
What's that loser cat guy doing here?

15:19.439 --> 15:21.031
Rich loser cat guy.

15:21.056 --> 15:22.200
And we are having a drink.

15:22.201 --> 15:23.540
Yeah, but what about Grandpa?

15:23.541 --> 15:25.740
- Well, Grandpa's home.
- Yes.

15:25.741 --> 15:28.120
Your home, where you live with him.

15:28.121 --> 15:30.280
I thought you guys were back together.
This isn't right.

15:30.281 --> 15:31.490
Who are you to judge me

15:31.491 --> 15:33.588
when you have that hussy Gina upstairs?

15:33.613 --> 15:34.782
You know about Gina?

15:34.807 --> 15:36.145
Oh, please.

15:37.281 --> 15:39.370
Oh, my God.

15:40.621 --> 15:41.780
I'm as bad as you.

15:41.781 --> 15:43.990
I've got Brie, who's great,

15:43.991 --> 15:45.910
and you've got Grandpa, who's the best,

15:45.911 --> 15:47.490
and we're both about to ruin this.

15:47.491 --> 15:49.740
Huh. It would appear that you and I

15:49.741 --> 15:52.700
share some of the same
self-destructive genes.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.540
Yeah. You got that and my legs,

15:54.541 --> 15:56.280
neither of which look good on you.

15:56.281 --> 15:57.830
I just don't want
to ruin things with Brie.

15:57.831 --> 16:00.200
Break the cycle. Don't be like me.

16:00.201 --> 16:02.780
I made some decisions that
really messed up my life.

16:02.781 --> 16:04.580
I mean, not only did I leave Grandpa,

16:04.581 --> 16:06.620
I left my whole family.

16:06.621 --> 16:08.830
And I came very close

16:08.831 --> 16:10.780
to bringing down an entire presidency.

16:10.781 --> 16:12.740
Come on, Grandma.

16:12.741 --> 16:14.830
You have a second chance with Grandpa.

16:14.831 --> 16:17.330
- You don't want to ruin that.
- I don't.

16:17.331 --> 16:18.780
- Do I?
- No.

16:18.781 --> 16:22.700
Okay. Let's go and tell
Gina and Dan that it's...

16:22.701 --> 16:24.370
time for them to go.

16:28.371 --> 16:29.870
Well, I just hope that Dan

16:29.871 --> 16:31.371
takes it better than Ronnie did.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.580
I just killed!

16:34.581 --> 16:36.280
Oh, that's a comedy term

16:36.281 --> 16:37.990
that means a lot of people laughed.

16:37.991 --> 16:39.450
Look at this.

16:39.451 --> 16:40.620
I'm already having trouble

16:40.621 --> 16:42.370
communicating with civilians.

16:42.371 --> 16:44.040
Am I really that terrible?

16:44.041 --> 16:46.200
I m... I drove you all the way out here.

16:46.201 --> 16:48.040
I left my family to support you.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.160
Trying to guilt me.

16:49.161 --> 16:50.370
I love it!

16:50.371 --> 16:51.990
I'm gonna write that down,
put it in my act.

16:51.991 --> 16:55.877
"Left my family. Professor Wah-Wah."

16:55.902 --> 16:58.410
So good.

16:58.411 --> 16:59.830
Sorry for the short notice,

16:59.831 --> 17:02.780
but I'm gonna have to quit
my job to pursue my dreams.

17:02.781 --> 17:04.701
I'm really gonna miss you, Professor Otto.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.990
Okay, well, this is your place.

17:07.991 --> 17:10.040
It was good knowing you.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.660
Change of plans.

17:11.661 --> 17:13.280
Keep driving.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.410
We're gonna put the past
behind us and never look back.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.160
I'm not gonna do that.

17:18.161 --> 17:20.160
Worth a shot!

17:24.491 --> 17:25.660
What do you think you're doing?!

17:25.661 --> 17:28.160
- Pull over!
- Heeeellll no!

17:28.161 --> 17:29.910
Seriously, Mom, pull over!

17:31.581 --> 17:33.330
Now get in the car.

17:33.331 --> 17:35.280
Stop trying to control me!

17:35.281 --> 17:36.540
I am not trying to control you...

17:36.541 --> 17:37.780
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

17:37.781 --> 17:39.330
You're not the boss of me!

17:39.331 --> 17:41.660
You are getting in this car,
and you are going to bed!

17:41.661 --> 17:43.490
I hate you!

17:48.581 --> 17:51.490
Oliver, we could just pick up
where we left off.

17:51.491 --> 17:52.830
I'm trying to break the cycle.

17:52.831 --> 17:53.741
What cycle?

17:53.742 --> 17:55.740
The grandma-grandson love cycle.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.540
You can just tell me
you don't want to see me.

17:57.541 --> 17:59.910
You don't have to make up
all this freaky stuff.

18:07.871 --> 18:09.370
That actually felt pretty good.

18:09.371 --> 18:10.910
You see?

18:10.911 --> 18:13.240
Now, we have it in us
to be kind, loyal people.

18:13.241 --> 18:14.950
Good news.

18:14.951 --> 18:16.700
Mittens loves your powder room toilet.

18:16.701 --> 18:18.330
Number one and number two.

18:19.451 --> 18:20.781
Your turn.

18:21.581 --> 18:23.700
Dan...

18:23.701 --> 18:25.870
I'm... I'm sorry, but...

18:25.871 --> 18:28.910
I can't get into
a relationship with you.

18:28.911 --> 18:30.830
I'm seeing someone else.

18:30.831 --> 18:32.040
Oh.

18:34.451 --> 18:35.911
We understand.

18:39.081 --> 18:41.241
Did I mention I have a lake house?

18:44.831 --> 18:46.094
Goodbye, Dan.

18:51.121 --> 18:52.839
Who needs money when I have...

18:52.864 --> 18:53.831
uh, when I have...

18:53.832 --> 18:55.330
- Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

18:58.491 --> 19:00.200
I'm not mad at you.

19:00.201 --> 19:01.990
"I'm not mad at you."

19:01.991 --> 19:03.620
I'm just upset with
the choice that you made.

19:03.621 --> 19:05.240
You could've gotten hurt.

19:05.241 --> 19:06.700
Fine-ah.

19:06.701 --> 19:08.120
Wait.

19:08.121 --> 19:10.120
Is that what I'm like?

19:10.121 --> 19:11.660
I didn't realize how much work it was

19:11.661 --> 19:13.620
to take care of another human being.

19:13.621 --> 19:16.240
And you take care of all of us.

19:16.241 --> 19:20.450
I'm really sorry for being such a jerk.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.700
Can you forgive me?

19:28.951 --> 19:31.870
That cold medicine you gave me
finally wore off.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.450
I don't remember anything.

19:34.451 --> 19:35.830
How was the playdate?

19:35.831 --> 19:37.870
Everyone had the most amazing time.

19:37.871 --> 19:39.620
That is so great!

19:39.621 --> 19:42.160
Thank you for following
all my instructions.

19:42.161 --> 19:44.040
Oh, I chucked that binder immediately.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.620
What?

19:45.621 --> 19:48.490
They figured it out,
just like I told you they would.

19:48.491 --> 19:50.370
By the way, what movie did you
watch with your friends?

19:50.371 --> 19:51.450
"Sausage Party."

19:51.451 --> 19:52.780
Isn't that R-rated?

19:52.781 --> 19:54.950
Like, super hard R-rated?

19:54.951 --> 19:57.330
It is. No one else's parents
would ever let them watch it

19:57.331 --> 19:59.410
in a million years.

19:59.411 --> 20:00.830
Mom!

20:00.831 --> 20:02.331
What? It's a cartoon.

20:03.871 --> 20:04.701
Uh-oh.

20:06.781 --> 20:08.780
Maddy's mom wants to know
why in the world

20:08.781 --> 20:11.540
we'd expose her daughter
to such "explicit trash."

20:11.541 --> 20:13.700
And Samantha's mom says
Samantha won't stop talking

20:13.701 --> 20:16.280
about how she figured out
where baby hot dogs come from.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.490
What were you thinking?

20:17.491 --> 20:19.580
What are you so mad about?

20:19.581 --> 20:23.120
Those girls love Anna-Kat,
Taylor didn't go to Trip's game,

20:23.121 --> 20:24.780
and Oliver got rid of Gina.

20:24.781 --> 20:27.240
You should be thanking me.

20:27.241 --> 20:29.540
Plus, I didn't cheat on your dad.

20:29.541 --> 20:31.200
I deserve a medal.

20:31.201 --> 20:33.040
Next time I'm sick and you're not home,

20:33.041 --> 20:34.910
just leave the kids with the dog.

20:42.411 --> 20:44.410
I'm still trying to flush that pill

20:44.411 --> 20:46.240
that my mom gave me out of my system.

20:46.241 --> 20:48.120
So, you really don't remember
riding Anna-Kat's bike?

20:48.121 --> 20:49.871
Not even a blur.

20:54.831 --> 20:56.831
- Anything else you might've done?
- No. Why?

20:59.877 --> 21:01.006
Huh.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.486
Huh.

21:10.581 --> 21:11.990
Well, at least we won't
lose track of him

21:11.991 --> 21:14.160
at the dog park anymore.
