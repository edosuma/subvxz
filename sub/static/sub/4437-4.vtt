11:14.757 --> 11:18.557
to the ballroom dance this Thurbday?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.354
Thursday.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.521
- Aw, so adorable!
- Gideon's got a girlfriend!

11:24.726 --> 11:27.775
They're expecting us.
Please say you'll go?

11:27.979 --> 11:29.231
ALL: Aw...

11:29.939 --> 11:33.068
Gideon, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to say...

11:33.276 --> 11:36.200
- I'm on the edge of my seat!
- This is gonna be adorable!

11:36.404 --> 11:39.533
If she says no, I'll die from sadness!

11:39.741 --> 11:41.709
I can verify that that will indeed happen.

I don't know. I have a lobster now.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.348
Well, at least it's over and you won't
ever have to go out with him again.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.887
Mabel? It's over, right? Mabel?

12:00.094 --> 12:04.099
Blargh! He asked me out again,
and I didn't know how to say no!

12:04.307 --> 12:05.684
Like this. "No."

12:05.892 --> 12:07.769
It's not that easy, Dipper!

12:07.977 --> 12:10.981
And I do like Gideon
as a friend, slash, little sister!

12:11.189 --> 12:12.691
So I didn't want to hurt his feelings!

12:12.899 --> 12:15.448
I just need to get things
back to where they used to be.

to be the end of the evening, right?

Don't you want this evening to last,
my sweet?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.129
No! I mean, yes.

I mean, I'm always happy
to hang out with a friend.

Other word for friend.

- Pal?
- I already said pal. Uh, mate?

12:38.049 --> 12:40.051
How about soul mate?

12:43.429 --> 12:44.931
Well, you can't say no to that!

He's so nice, but I can't keep doing this,
but I can't break his heart.

happened on that date?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.068
I don't know! I was in the friend zone.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.745
And then,

12:58.945 --> 13:00.572
he pulled me into the romance zone!

13:04.909 --> 13:06.786
It's not like
you're going to have to marry Gideon.

Great news, Mabel!
You have to marry Gideon!

13:09.580 --> 13:10.456

It's all part of my long-term deal
with Buddy Gleeful!

There's a lot of cash
tied up in this thing.

All right. Enough is enough!

If you can't break up with Gideon,
then I'll do it for you.

Thumbs up, indeed, my friend.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.913
How did it go? Was he mad?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.624
Did he try to read your mind
with his psychic powers?

14:34.832 --> 14:37.881
