00:17.890 --> 00:19.656
The athletes are on the track.

00:19.690 --> 00:22.358
They have
both been preparing long and hard

00:22.391 --> 00:24.358
for this very moment.

00:26.756 --> 00:29.291
Go on. Get real.

00:34.857 --> 00:36.158
BOOM!

00:36.190 --> 00:36.723
And they're away!

00:39.956 --> 00:41.890
Well,
the champ has gotten them showing

00:41.924 --> 00:44.358
what the
audience is witnessing right now.

00:45.789 --> 00:50.190
My balls! My balls! Hello.
This man is grabbing my balls!

00:51.324 --> 00:52.757
Well, I'm not sure that he did

00:52.790 --> 00:53.924
but we shall see.

00:53.957 --> 00:54.724
Only time will tell.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.525
Well, he took the corner

00:57.558 --> 00:58.757
and he's seen an opportunity.

01:04.822 --> 01:06.391
You alright?

01:06.423 --> 01:08.524
He's lining things up carefully.

01:08.923 --> 01:09.556
I'm Mark.

01:10.190 --> 01:11.290
Hi.

01:11.325 --> 01:11.858
He's going for it, you know.

01:11.890 --> 01:12.857
You've got no chance!

01:15.823 --> 01:17.358
Do you want a leaflet?

01:19.190 --> 01:20.623
Oh, that's a cheeky move.

01:24.657 --> 01:26.824
Cheap
foul, that's not in the rule book.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.890
Well,
they're facing a real challenge now.

01:31.924 --> 01:33.624
The finishing line in sight.

01:34.656 --> 01:36.756
And
seemingly no way to get to it.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.224
But they're not backing down.

01:41.257 --> 01:42.557
They are going for it!

01:44.323 --> 01:46.424
But no,
they're denied right on the line.

01:46.457 --> 01:50.724
So very
close and yet so completely naked!

02:00.423 --> 02:01.756
You next.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.757
Ma-maybe you-you could come
back later, Mark, you know?

02:06.889 --> 02:10.190
Ben, we have this
every year, right.

02:10.223 --> 02:11.424
You don't like it.

02:11.456 --> 02:12.523
It's like... it's
like Eurovision.

02:12.556 --> 02:13.690
What?

02:14.790 --> 02:15.757
Are you scared?

02:16.723 --> 02:19.191
I'm not scared. Don't be daft.

02:21.890 --> 02:24.258
Whoa, whoa, too quick.

02:25.890 --> 02:27.290
Right, We can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

02:27.823 --> 02:28.524
What's the easy way?

02:29.889 --> 02:32.756
The easy way is I take
a sample from you.

02:33.789 --> 02:34.623
And it takes ten seconds.

02:34.657 --> 02:35.691
Hmm?

02:36.923 --> 02:39.757
The hard way is I
get a rusty knife

02:40.590 --> 02:41.490
stab you in the leg,

02:41.523 --> 02:42.590
you bleed all over the rug.

02:43.723 --> 02:44.724
We roll rug up, take
that to the lab.

02:44.756 --> 02:46.457
And the rust from the blade

02:46.490 --> 02:47.857
gives you lockjaw.

02:47.889 --> 02:50.856
And unable to speak or move

02:50.890 --> 02:55.891
you expire here in silent,
expressionless agony.

02:58.223 --> 02:59.190
Good decision.

02:59.223 --> 02:59.723
What?

03:00.790 --> 03:01.656
I-I hadn't made one, Mark.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.490
I hadn't... ha-ha-ha!

03:03.522 --> 03:05.157
Next year - by hook or by crook

03:05.191 --> 03:06.823
you are coming into hospital.

03:06.857 --> 03:08.457
We'll even give you a lollipop.

03:08.490 --> 03:10.290
Don't say that word to me, Mark.

03:11.223 --> 03:11.923
What, lollipop?

03:11.957 --> 03:14.158
Hospital! Hospital! Hospital!

03:14.190 --> 03:16.390
Ben, we met in hospital.

03:16.424 --> 03:18.223
If it wasn't for a hospital,

03:18.257 --> 03:20.757
you'd be one mate short of a
mate. You'd be mate-less.

03:28.690 --> 03:31.190
When was the last time you
rode an actual bicycle, Ben?

03:31.224 --> 03:35.224
Mark. Put them
down, put them down!

03:36.058 --> 03:37.724
They are
collectors' items, Mark.

03:37.756 --> 03:38.857
BEN
Put them down.

03:44.256 --> 03:46.556
MARK
Are you still free Wednesday?

03:47.622 --> 03:48.589
BEN
Yeah, of course I am, Mark.

03:48.623 --> 03:49.857
BEN
Don't be daft.

03:55.856 --> 03:57.790
Are we allowed to be here?

03:58.622 --> 04:00.423
Who can stop us?

04:01.522 --> 04:03.523
Lock up your Pot Noodles.

04:04.191 --> 04:05.757
Tonight, the canteen is ours!

04:12.822 --> 04:14.490
I hope we get to do this again.

04:15.224 --> 04:16.389
What do you mean?

04:17.656 --> 04:20.891
I mean, I hope I stick
around long enough...

04:23.889 --> 04:26.125
Yeah, of course you will.

04:27.257 --> 04:27.823
We can do this every
Wednesday night

04:27.857 --> 04:29.691
if you want, me and you.

04:30.556 --> 04:32.290
Guaranteed.

04:33.856 --> 04:37.389
Yeah, yeah, sound.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.357
Yeah.

04:39.823 --> 04:40.723
Cheers.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.424
Javan, Marlene, your results.

04:52.589 --> 04:53.756
So...

04:54.690 --> 04:56.757
Jerk, put her out of her misery.

04:56.789 --> 04:58.190
Tell her what we already know.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.424
It's not all bleak.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.524
True, the initial treatment

05:04.557 --> 05:06.191
didn't achieve what we'd hoped.

05:07.322 --> 05:08.856
The tumour's still
metastasizing,

05:08.890 --> 05:10.757
growing to the liver.

05:11.623 --> 05:12.590
Which means we will have to

05:12.622 --> 05:14.556
proceed with the chemotherapy.

05:20.522 --> 05:22.857
I went through chemotherapy
when I was your age.

05:23.789 --> 05:24.756
And it's not fun.

05:25.856 --> 05:28.457
But you can beat this, okay?

05:29.756 --> 05:32.225
Do you really think so?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.125
I'm living proof.

05:40.923 --> 05:41.891
Thank you.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.756
Just gonna get your notes, okay?

05:47.723 --> 05:48.724
You okay?

05:49.256 --> 05:49.890
Yeah. I'll be fine.

05:49.924 --> 05:51.523
Mum, I promise.

05:51.556 --> 05:52.589
Okay.

05:52.622 --> 05:53.823
It's just an hospital.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.757
I'll look after him if you want.

05:57.790 --> 05:58.624
Thank you.

05:59.822 --> 06:00.756
I've seen 'em all
come and go here.

06:02.423 --> 06:03.756
What do you mean go?

06:07.355 --> 06:08.390
You mean they died?

06:08.422 --> 06:10.490
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:11.390 --> 06:12.790
No, I didn't mean that.

06:13.856 --> 06:14.591
Some of them probably did.

06:16.623 --> 06:17.790
Mum.

06:18.822 --> 06:20.657
You're gonna be okay.

06:20.690 --> 06:21.691
Thanks, mate.

06:23.322 --> 06:24.190
It's okay.

06:26.790 --> 06:28.191
It's gonna be okay.

06:29.924 --> 06:32.590
Sponge ball.

07:11.191 --> 07:16.190
72, 69, 66, 63...

07:19.822 --> 07:24.389
47, 54, 51...

07:32.689 --> 07:33.823
Thank you.

07:33.856 --> 07:35.289
Sorry about this.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.624
Thank you.

08:20.623 --> 08:21.757
Hello?

08:27.189 --> 08:28.390
Hello?

08:34.422 --> 08:35.724
Excuse me?

08:43.856 --> 08:44.756
Hmm!

08:46.189 --> 08:47.457
Am I... am I bleeding?

08:47.490 --> 08:48.691
Am I bleeding?

08:49.657 --> 08:51.624
Okay, sorry for shooting
you in the head, mate.

08:52.624 --> 08:53.624
Just didn't expect to
see anyone down here.

08:54.156 --> 08:55.891
But I-I-I work here.

08:55.924 --> 08:57.724
Thi-this is where I work.

08:58.123 --> 09:01.524
Oh, Ben! Ben!

09:03.355 --> 09:05.123
I thought they closed
your department down.

09:05.790 --> 09:06.491
Sorry?

09:06.790 --> 09:07.790
You trained me.

09:08.856 --> 09:09.756
Maybe ten years ago now though.

09:10.622 --> 09:12.557
Ben. The office ghost.

09:14.522 --> 09:15.523
I'm-I'm not a ghost.

09:17.422 --> 09:18.157
Come in.

09:19.290 --> 09:22.257
Test results, mystery samples.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.757
Just so we're clear.

09:26.423 --> 09:27.322
Jade dumped you, right?

09:27.355 --> 09:30.223
Jade dumped me?

09:30.957 --> 09:32.290
Now, that's ludicrous.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.156
You see, what really...

09:34.189 --> 09:34.824
Hmm.

09:36.289 --> 09:37.756
Okay, she might have done.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.390
But she wanted more of a
commitment, if I'm honest.

09:39.790 --> 09:40.923
And I wasn't...

09:40.957 --> 09:42.691
Well, I'm not looking
for commitment.

09:43.556 --> 09:45.723
Young, free and single, me.

09:45.756 --> 09:48.623
In case you need a
shoulder to cry on.

10:18.189 --> 10:19.490
Eastern Road, mate.

10:43.889 --> 10:45.456
You have the wrong
flat, alright.

10:46.223 --> 10:47.457
Can I come in?

10:47.490 --> 10:48.290
Uh, sorry, you're not
on the list tonight.

10:49.223 --> 10:49.657
Jade, wait.

10:49.922 --> 10:50.556
What?

10:51.823 --> 10:52.624
Are you cooking?

10:52.656 --> 10:53.356
Yeah.

10:53.956 --> 10:54.757
Who you cooking for?

10:55.656 --> 10:56.623
My mum.

10:57.756 --> 11:00.257
Oh. Oh, she's-she's here.

11:00.290 --> 11:01.323
What?

11:01.356 --> 11:02.257
Shit, oh Mark, you know what.

11:02.289 --> 11:03.557
That is a really...

11:06.622 --> 11:08.624
Flower, candle.

11:09.955 --> 11:11.389
Your mum is in for
a treat, isn't she?

11:11.423 --> 11:12.423
Mm-hmm.

11:12.955 --> 11:13.657
Is that a new top?

11:13.690 --> 11:14.390
Yes.

11:14.823 --> 11:15.857
Outrageous.

11:15.890 --> 11:17.523
Is there a point
to you being here?

11:17.557 --> 11:18.623
Well, it would appear I have
arrived not a moment too soon.

11:24.622 --> 11:25.524
What?

11:25.557 --> 11:26.757
Are you going to dance or sing?

11:26.789 --> 11:27.790
Because neither is a
good option, you know.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.757
Our tune, babe. From Venice.

11:32.355 --> 11:32.856
Remember?

11:33.857 --> 11:34.557
Yeah?

11:35.789 --> 11:36.756
Yes.

11:40.557 --> 11:44.590
Jade, I've realised that I really
need you in my life right now.

11:44.622 --> 11:45.256
No, no, no.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.223
This is no...

11:46.257 --> 11:47.923
This isn't the way to
do this, Mark, alright?

11:47.955 --> 11:48.757
Please get up, please.

11:49.956 --> 11:50.890
I'll go away for a week-end.

11:50.922 --> 11:51.756
Anything.

11:51.791 --> 11:52.591
Just-just please,
just take me back.

11:52.623 --> 11:54.490
Venice was great
but we missed it.

11:54.523 --> 11:55.691
We missed our moment, alright?

11:58.756 --> 11:59.524
Sorry, look...

12:00.423 --> 12:01.590
Am I interrupting something?

12:03.923 --> 12:04.857
Obviously.

12:11.790 --> 12:12.757
And you are?

12:15.889 --> 12:16.791
Going.

12:20.355 --> 12:22.757
Mark, where are you?

12:31.723 --> 12:36.723
Where are you now?

13:03.490 --> 13:04.490
You in?

13:05.223 --> 13:06.491
Can I come round?

13:17.190 --> 13:18.357
Eighteen minutes late.

13:18.389 --> 13:20.423
Already eighteen
minutes late. Mark!

13:30.423 --> 13:31.423
I'm sorry.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.490
Bread and, um, some water.

13:35.589 --> 13:36.723
Would you like me to

13:36.888 --> 13:38.456
make you a cocktail
for your umbrella?

13:39.390 --> 13:39.856
No, it's a travel umbrella.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.823
Are you traveling somewhere?

13:43.856 --> 13:45.724
Can I get you one for the road?

13:45.756 --> 13:46.423
No.

13:48.723 --> 13:50.322
I'll get you a menu.

13:50.356 --> 13:52.190
Uh, I'll just... I'll
just be five minutes.

13:52.223 --> 13:54.290
I'm ju... I'm-I'm just
waiting for my friend, so...

13:56.222 --> 13:58.289
Right, I'll see you
in five minutes then.

14:02.623 --> 14:03.723
Thank you.

14:14.255 --> 14:15.256
Hello Evie.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.657
I said give me half an hour.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.356
Turns out I was just
around the corner.

14:20.289 --> 14:21.356
Brought wine.

14:22.856 --> 14:24.356
Fuck it.

14:39.222 --> 14:40.755
He reminds me of Mr Bubbles.

14:42.856 --> 14:44.724
That was my hamster
when I was little.

14:47.722 --> 14:49.222
Had to put him in another cage

14:49.255 --> 14:50.788
to stop the other hamsters
from trying to eat him,

14:50.822 --> 14:52.224
actually, in the end.

14:55.256 --> 14:56.823
Lived to the ripe
old age of three.

15:00.789 --> 15:02.723
Let's just hope he tips.

15:05.256 --> 15:05.756
Send.

15:08.623 --> 15:09.690
Where are you?

15:16.923 --> 15:18.157
Crikey.

15:18.788 --> 15:20.755
You're not stopping are you?

15:22.190 --> 15:26.124
No, um... just thirsty.

15:34.789 --> 15:39.756
Oh. Crazy.

15:42.756 --> 15:44.624
Are you... are you joking?

15:46.222 --> 15:47.490
What'd you do that for!?

15:48.156 --> 15:49.256
I'm sorry, did you come here

15:49.290 --> 15:50.624
to text or to have sex with me?

15:52.190 --> 15:53.756
Um, se... oh...

15:57.922 --> 15:58.822
Brought you some, uh...

15:59.856 --> 16:01.756
Pea soup here, it's uh...

16:02.789 --> 16:04.257
It's a peas offering.

16:05.855 --> 16:07.556
Thank... thank you.

16:14.923 --> 16:17.491
Hmm. Hmm, yeah.

16:18.655 --> 16:19.623
Can really, really
taste the peas.

16:20.023 --> 16:22.390
Yeah. Peas man.

17:10.721 --> 17:11.755
Ben.

17:12.321 --> 17:12.888
Mark.

17:12.923 --> 17:13.823
I wanna apologise.

17:15.521 --> 17:16.491
Dinner tonight instead?

17:17.356 --> 17:18.756
Tonight is a Thursday.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.756
Yep, radical concept, I know.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.557
You could have
texted me, you know.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.524
Mark, you're stepping
on my jacket.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.456
Actually, no, I
couldn't, my phone's...

17:37.889 --> 17:39.323
You know, I am not an idiot.

17:39.355 --> 17:41.489
I know that Wednesdays
have become a chore.

17:46.922 --> 17:48.423
That's not true.

17:49.922 --> 17:51.588
Well, maybe sometimes.

17:51.621 --> 17:52.822
But only when you eat chicken
wings wearing surgical gloves.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.389
Do you know what I mean?

18:18.222 --> 18:18.889
Come with me now.

18:18.922 --> 18:19.555
No.

18:20.856 --> 18:21.890
Come on, just get
off of the bus.

18:21.923 --> 18:22.756
No.

18:24.822 --> 18:25.789
Right.

18:28.390 --> 18:29.390
See ya. Oh, sorry.

18:31.755 --> 18:33.755
Mark! Get off my briefcase!

18:34.889 --> 18:36.124
Mark, that is my briefcase!

18:36.956 --> 18:37.756
Mark! Mark!

18:38.621 --> 18:39.755
Give it back now.

18:40.055 --> 18:40.755
Mark!

18:41.356 --> 18:41.823
Mark!

18:42.756 --> 18:43.523
Give it back. Now.

18:44.855 --> 18:45.856
Now.

18:47.223 --> 18:48.424
Mark, Mark.

18:49.789 --> 18:50.756
This way.

18:50.789 --> 18:51.756
Come with me.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.756
What are-what are you doing?

18:54.689 --> 18:55.756
Where are you taking me?

18:55.921 --> 18:58.224
Do not take my briefcase again.

18:58.622 --> 18:59.456
It is pathetic.

18:59.489 --> 19:00.723
You're pathetic.

19:04.289 --> 19:05.222
Which floor?

19:05.256 --> 19:06.555
Third please.

19:07.189 --> 19:07.689
Ben.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.790
We usually take the stairs.

19:29.789 --> 19:31.890
Mark, is this door
gonna shut behind us?

19:32.689 --> 19:33.590
Just leave it.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.223
Come on.

19:36.856 --> 19:38.257
I'll pro... I'll prop it.

19:39.189 --> 19:39.755
Metal.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.656
Hey, Mark, wait, wait up.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.623
I love it up here.

20:07.755 --> 20:08.689
Lager?

20:09.089 --> 20:09.789
Mark, what we...

20:10.222 --> 20:11.156
What we doing here?

20:14.789 --> 20:16.422
Tah dah!

20:16.455 --> 20:17.522
The test results.

20:28.556 --> 20:30.857
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.

20:32.855 --> 20:34.590
Quite advanced.

20:37.689 --> 20:38.790
It's come back, eh?

20:40.521 --> 20:43.356
Always knew that
having AL-L as kids

20:44.821 --> 20:46.522
would increase the risk of
having A-M-L as adults.

20:46.556 --> 20:47.590
Well...

20:57.622 --> 20:59.690
Fucking, yeah.

21:01.189 --> 21:03.123
Things are just
starting to, uh...

21:03.923 --> 21:05.756
to look up for me, you know.

21:06.789 --> 21:11.189
I-I even bumped into a new
friend at work the other day.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.423
How... how long have I got?

21:18.788 --> 21:20.223
How long have you got?

21:28.354 --> 21:29.756
How long have you got?

21:35.355 --> 21:36.756
It's hard to say, mate.

21:39.822 --> 21:40.890
Oh my God!

21:42.355 --> 21:44.756
Oh! Oh my Go...

21:47.588 --> 21:48.522
Oh.

21:53.422 --> 21:58.389
I want...

21:59.555 --> 22:00.755
Oh shit.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.190
I don't... I want more time.

22:05.222 --> 22:06.756
Time to do what exactly?

22:08.922 --> 22:09.890
To upset people on lifts?

22:12.255 --> 22:13.688
Sterilise your entire flat?

22:13.722 --> 22:15.456
I am still in my prime.

22:15.489 --> 22:17.856
I am just... I'm
still in my prime.

22:21.789 --> 22:23.756
And I'm sorry it's bad news.

22:24.622 --> 22:26.856
But, do you know what,

22:26.889 --> 22:29.190
a part of me thought you'd
be a little bit relieved.

22:29.856 --> 22:30.556
What?

22:31.755 --> 22:32.755
Yeah.

22:33.888 --> 22:34.788
What?

22:34.822 --> 22:35.756
You know, I think about it,

22:36.721 --> 22:37.622
tha... that's when you changed.

22:38.889 --> 22:40.388
When we went into remission

22:41.355 --> 22:43.124
that's when all the
odd behaviour started.

22:43.856 --> 22:44.623
That weird counting,

22:44.655 --> 22:45.421
your sponge ball,

22:45.454 --> 22:45.855
the fucking organising.

22:45.889 --> 22:46.756
The OCD.

22:48.256 --> 22:49.857
Locking yourself away
like Howard Hughes.

22:51.655 --> 22:55.890
You actually have a reason to act
like your fucking world's ending.

22:56.956 --> 22:58.688
You are a heartless bastard.

22:58.722 --> 23:01.190
This heartless bastard has taken
you to doctors' appointments,

23:01.856 --> 23:03.256
therapy groups, hypnotists.

23:03.288 --> 23:04.756
That fucking lazy
eyed gypsy woman

23:04.788 --> 23:05.890
that read your tea leaves.

23:05.922 --> 23:06.555
And what's the point of that?

23:06.589 --> 23:07.489
What was it for?

23:07.522 --> 23:08.321
I don't ask you to do that.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.489
Well, I did it anyway.

23:10.355 --> 23:11.523
You're wasting your life.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.690
You're wasting my
fucking life as well.

23:15.222 --> 23:16.655
These past sixteen years

23:16.688 --> 23:18.755
you've been a fucking
selfish bastard.

23:19.688 --> 23:20.388
And you've wasted it all.

23:22.222 --> 23:23.455
We should have been out

23:23.489 --> 23:24.488
We should have been
enjoying ourselves.

23:24.522 --> 23:25.389
But we're not.

23:30.388 --> 23:34.288
And now we're two sad,
lonely bastards sat on a roof.

23:34.956 --> 23:35.856
And one of us is dying.

23:35.889 --> 23:40.522
Yeah, me. Me. Me. Me.

23:44.522 --> 23:45.755
What is the point?

23:49.821 --> 23:50.755
Do you know what?

23:51.322 --> 23:51.823
Fuck it.

23:53.756 --> 23:55.889
Come here. Let's just jump.

23:57.289 --> 23:58.356
What are you doing?
Let go of me, Mark.

23:58.388 --> 23:59.321
We used to do everything
together, didn't we, Ben?

23:59.355 --> 24:00.156
Come on.

24:00.189 --> 24:00.856
Well, let's do this now.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.188
Get off me now.

24:02.221 --> 24:02.788
Let's die together.
I'll die with you.

24:02.822 --> 24:03.756
I'll do that for you.

24:03.788 --> 24:04.622
I will do that for you

24:04.656 --> 24:05.623
because I'm a good friend.

24:05.656 --> 24:06.589
Let's do your counting thing.

24:06.621 --> 24:07.255
Ninety-nine.

24:08.454 --> 24:09.388
Ninety-seven.

24:09.422 --> 24:09.890
Come on!

24:10.221 --> 24:11.589
You are fucking crazy, Mark.

24:12.323 --> 24:14.389
You are crazy. Crazy.

24:14.855 --> 24:16.255
Proper crazy.

24:17.355 --> 24:19.256
And the gypsy woman
was your idea!

24:20.288 --> 24:21.422
She was your idea.

25:07.856 --> 25:08.856
Leave me alone!

25:09.788 --> 25:10.823
Jesus!

25:11.889 --> 25:13.223
What was that?

25:13.923 --> 25:14.856
It's a travel umbrella.

25:14.888 --> 25:15.723
What are you doing here, Mark?

25:16.789 --> 25:17.823
Making a cuppa.

25:19.421 --> 25:19.890
Oof.

25:20.855 --> 25:22.188
Do you want one?

25:22.922 --> 25:23.689
Yeah, I'll have a PG.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.490
I'll put the kettle on.

25:32.923 --> 25:34.123
Don't go to work today.

25:35.254 --> 25:36.755
I've got to save
my sick days, Mark.

25:38.721 --> 25:40.488
Would they even notice
if you didn't turn up?

25:40.522 --> 25:41.523
Yes, of course they would.

25:42.388 --> 25:42.857
It is a very important job.

25:46.855 --> 25:48.890
Ben, I'm sorry about what
happened last night.

25:49.956 --> 25:51.523
But if you take the day off work

25:52.188 --> 25:53.289
I'll even write you a sick note.

25:55.289 --> 25:56.189
What-what happened
last night, Mark?

25:56.922 --> 25:57.789
Oh, yeah, I know.

25:58.855 --> 26:00.255
My friend told me I had cancer.

26:03.289 --> 26:04.823
You can take your sick note

26:04.856 --> 26:06.456
and you can shove
it up your arse!

26:07.354 --> 26:08.590
Shove it up your arse, Mark!

26:09.323 --> 26:10.590
Shove it up your arse.

26:12.789 --> 26:14.189
And I want my mug back!

26:14.789 --> 26:15.355
I want it back!

26:15.689 --> 26:17.122
Stick to Wednesdays
then, shall we?

26:37.756 --> 26:38.823
Dress down Friday.

26:46.822 --> 26:47.523
Hey, now.

26:50.755 --> 26:52.555
If you can't beat
them, join them.

26:55.622 --> 26:56.756
Are you for real?

27:00.789 --> 27:02.756
How's wanky McBeard Face?

27:05.855 --> 27:06.856
Uh, he's fine.

27:08.254 --> 27:09.590
How's Evie?

27:10.422 --> 27:11.123
Hmm.

27:12.789 --> 27:13.756
Touché.

27:17.789 --> 27:20.823
Listen, I'm-I'm sorry about
the other night.

27:22.489 --> 27:25.422
I just... I-I-I can't get
back on that rollercoaster.

27:26.922 --> 27:29.723
No, right. I understand.

27:30.955 --> 27:36.188
You're actually taking this break-up
harder than I expected. Hmm.

27:37.254 --> 27:38.255
Flipflops.

27:40.622 --> 27:41.423
New me.

27:43.855 --> 27:46.422
I don't-I don't think
you're a bad bloke.

27:47.923 --> 27:49.256
You're no... you're not.

27:49.289 --> 27:49.857
I do...

27:50.789 --> 27:53.523
It's just... oh dear.

27:55.889 --> 27:58.189
You-you see the entire world

27:59.355 --> 28:00.856
through this prism
of your own design.

28:01.789 --> 28:04.655
It's-it's... it's always
about what you want

28:04.689 --> 28:06.188
when you're ready,
when you're in pain.

28:07.923 --> 28:10.490
Yeah. I get it. I'm selfish.

28:12.721 --> 28:15.722
But that was the old me.

28:16.222 --> 28:16.756
Hmm.

28:17.656 --> 28:20.490
This... is the new me.

28:20.821 --> 28:21.822
Wow.

28:22.756 --> 28:23.890
What if I told you

28:23.921 --> 28:26.288
I was about to
embark on a project

28:26.821 --> 28:28.388
a life or death project

28:28.422 --> 28:30.756
entirely for someone
else's benefit?

28:31.889 --> 28:33.823
I would say does
that someone else

28:33.855 --> 28:35.188
happen to have nice tits?

28:35.789 --> 28:36.423
Hmm.

28:36.688 --> 28:37.322
Hmm.

28:40.788 --> 28:42.789
He is a tit. Does that count?

28:44.789 --> 28:46.423
Good luck with
your project, Mark.

29:02.788 --> 29:03.755
Hello?

29:08.855 --> 29:09.756
Hello?

29:47.521 --> 29:48.288
Oh my God.

29:52.488 --> 29:53.589
Let's celebrate.

29:54.722 --> 29:57.789
No, Mark, no, no, no, no, no.

29:58.822 --> 30:00.188
Here he is!

30:02.922 --> 30:07.756
"For he's a
jolly good fellow..."

30:10.688 --> 30:13.223
"and none of you
quite know why!"

30:17.221 --> 30:17.789
I didn't know you were leaving.

30:18.921 --> 30:20.888
Although to be fair, I
thought you'd left years ago.

30:21.954 --> 30:22.723
There's been a mistake.

30:22.755 --> 30:23.589
I'm-I'm not leaving.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.756
I'm-I'm-I'm not...
I'm not leaving.

30:26.322 --> 30:27.523
We want to thank you all

30:27.555 --> 30:29.723
from the bottom of our hearts

30:29.755 --> 30:32.222
for ignoring my best friend

30:32.254 --> 30:33.722
for all these years.

30:34.855 --> 30:37.656
And now you can
all stuff yourself.

30:37.689 --> 30:38.322
Mark!

30:38.354 --> 30:39.488
Pfft! Come on.

30:39.522 --> 30:40.855
I-I promise you I'm not leaving.

30:40.887 --> 30:41.755
Yes, you are!

30:42.521 --> 30:43.289
I'm not leaving.

30:43.954 --> 30:44.622
I-I'm not leaving.

30:46.721 --> 30:47.822
Oh my gosh.

30:48.656 --> 30:49.888
Get-get off me.

30:49.921 --> 30:51.787
You have just lost
me my job, Mark.

30:51.820 --> 30:52.821
You have just lost me my job.

30:52.855 --> 30:54.588
What does anything
matter anyway?

30:54.622 --> 30:56.555
This is entropy,
a hurtling crash

30:57.455 --> 30:58.123
towards certain oblivion.

30:58.821 --> 30:59.922
You...

30:59.955 --> 31:00.922
You have lost your head.

31:00.954 --> 31:03.256
You have lost your head, Mark.

31:04.521 --> 31:05.388
Leave me a alone.

31:05.421 --> 31:06.756
Just leave me alone!

31:08.589 --> 31:09.255
Ben!

31:22.855 --> 31:23.490
Surprise.

31:31.722 --> 31:32.556
What have you done?

31:33.787 --> 31:35.689
What have you done, Mark?

31:36.389 --> 31:37.754
No, no, no.

31:38.922 --> 31:41.889
Oh, no. Oh no!

31:42.787 --> 31:44.755
Mark, Mark.

31:45.888 --> 31:47.222
What have you done this time?

31:47.254 --> 31:48.589
Calm down, I'm-I'm freeing you

31:48.621 --> 31:49.688
from the burden of all your...

31:49.721 --> 31:50.755
your horrible lifestyle.

31:52.821 --> 31:54.755
Carefully collated
collections of crap.

31:56.854 --> 31:58.888
Look, I could go on about

31:59.887 --> 32:01.322
how you can't take it with you.

32:02.489 --> 32:03.921
But to actually do
something about it

32:03.955 --> 32:06.755
that-that-that takes a pair
of large cheesy Wotsits.

32:07.754 --> 32:09.388
I'm-I'm calling the police.

32:09.422 --> 32:10.423
And say what?

32:11.854 --> 32:14.889
'Constable, he's stolen my antibacterial
wipes, and-and plastic boxes.'

32:15.955 --> 32:17.321
My-my mother's wedding ring!

32:17.355 --> 32:18.123
You've ta...

32:20.922 --> 32:22.721
Not a complete lunatic.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.288
Would you like to visit
the rest of your stuff?

32:31.921 --> 32:32.755
Hmm.

32:33.522 --> 32:34.156
Follow me.

32:40.189 --> 32:40.889
Just over there.

33:00.955 --> 33:01.822
Mark!

33:03.787 --> 33:07.188
Attention
consumer zombies!

33:08.588 --> 33:12.855
Welcome to the Church of
Material Possessions Mobile Unit.

33:14.455 --> 33:18.855
Bring forth your offerings
to the altar of redemption.

33:21.354 --> 33:26.356
Everything you see here is not only
irrelevant to your eternal souls.

33:27.855 --> 33:30.389
It is also for sale.

33:31.522 --> 33:32.855
Who will free us of these

33:32.888 --> 33:33.888
mortal trinkets?

33:35.954 --> 33:38.222
Who will shed us of these material coils?
Come on, name your price.

33:38.821 --> 33:39.589
Make your offer.

33:39.621 --> 33:40.589
A quid for the DVD?

33:40.621 --> 33:41.722
Done, young sir.

33:42.589 --> 33:43.821
How much for that?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.523
For you, sir, 'cause you're
so good looking, £5.

33:47.189 --> 33:47.787
Come on, mate, I'm on benefits.

33:47.821 --> 33:48.655
£3.

33:48.688 --> 33:49.289
Two quid.

33:49.322 --> 33:49.822
£1.

33:49.854 --> 33:50.787
Got yourself a deal.

33:50.821 --> 33:51.555
Good man.

33:53.188 --> 33:53.789
50p in the bucket.

33:54.754 --> 33:55.588
Mark.

33:56.954 --> 33:57.754
All your offerings
in this blue bucket.

33:58.654 --> 33:59.388
What do you want, mate?

34:00.821 --> 34:03.754
This machine, sir, promises
to organize your life

34:03.788 --> 34:05.755
and fill your mind
with knowledge.

34:06.954 --> 34:11.222
But it is a time toilet whose
only desire is to be worshipped!

34:13.621 --> 34:14.755
Ladies and gentlemen.

34:15.855 --> 34:17.588
Ask yourself this question:

34:18.621 --> 34:22.855
'Do I own my possessions or
do my possessions own me?'

34:23.856 --> 34:26.856
How about nine hundred
For the set of wheels?

34:27.788 --> 34:31.855
You, sir, are a fuc...
fine entrepreneur.

34:32.888 --> 34:34.755
£900 for this.

34:36.021 --> 34:41.422
£900 to the bloke who weighs
approximately nine hundred pounds.

34:42.222 --> 34:43.322
Hey!

34:43.355 --> 34:44.255
I, for one, appreciate
the symmetry.

34:44.289 --> 34:45.523
What we saying, yeah?

34:46.722 --> 34:49.389
Tell you what, you can have it if
you take all the crap in the boot.

34:51.487 --> 34:52.422
Having fun yet?

34:52.955 --> 34:53.922
Mark, this is a B...

34:53.954 --> 34:55.121
Mark, this is a BMW.

34:55.853 --> 34:56.821
Mark, this is a BMW.

34:58.855 --> 34:59.754
What's going on?

35:00.654 --> 35:02.721
What's going on here?

35:02.755 --> 35:04.789
We are freeing ourselves of a dead
albatross of our material possessions.

35:06.489 --> 35:09.256
Smell the liberation!

35:09.289 --> 35:10.522
Can smell the bullshit.

35:10.555 --> 35:11.755
You. Out!

35:12.720 --> 35:13.721
I'm-I'm sorry.

35:15.854 --> 35:16.855
What are you doing?

35:17.921 --> 35:18.821
Who wants some furniture?

35:18.855 --> 35:19.555
Come on, Ben, help me out.

35:19.787 --> 35:20.488
Get involved.

35:20.520 --> 35:21.787
Come on.

35:21.821 --> 35:23.189
You can't do this without a
street traders' licence.

35:24.820 --> 35:25.754
We're nearly done.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.754
And I can see that people are starting
to see the bright lights of redemption.

35:31.588 --> 35:33.755
Over there, by Argos.

35:35.621 --> 35:38.589
I'm assuming you do
have a trader's licence?

35:39.921 --> 35:40.821
We're not trading.

35:41.754 --> 35:42.721
This is an exorcism.

35:43.654 --> 35:45.222
We're freeing ourselves from all

35:45.255 --> 35:47.889
the evil rubbish that builds up

35:47.922 --> 35:50.789
in our lives and
vanquishes our souls.

35:51.855 --> 35:53.288
I'm shutting you down, mate.

35:53.321 --> 35:54.355
Yeah, everyone, move away.
Come on, move away.

35:55.288 --> 35:56.456
Move away. Get back. Get back.

35:57.355 --> 35:58.122
Oi, move away.

35:58.289 --> 35:58.755
Come on, gents.

35:59.322 --> 36:00.422
I'm not finished yet.

36:00.455 --> 36:01.423
I've still got more stuff.

36:02.588 --> 36:03.356
No, no, no, come
on, hand it over.

36:03.389 --> 36:04.156
I tell you what...

36:04.189 --> 36:04.889
Alright, don't push it.

36:04.921 --> 36:05.754
I'll give you that for free.

36:06.087 --> 36:07.188
What you got there?

36:07.222 --> 36:07.855
It's just my sponge ball.

36:07.887 --> 36:08.722
Hand it over.

36:09.721 --> 36:10.356
Get off!

36:10.389 --> 36:10.788
Give it to me.

36:10.821 --> 36:11.489
Okay.

36:16.888 --> 36:18.889
I'm... I'm so sorry, it
was just a sponge ball.

36:30.854 --> 36:33.521
Make it easy, make it easy!

36:47.254 --> 36:48.521
Thank you, sir.

36:49.820 --> 36:52.188
Uh, when-when do
we get our call?

36:52.788 --> 36:53.522
Fuck off.

36:53.921 --> 36:54.754
Of course.

37:06.389 --> 37:07.389
Oh.

37:08.222 --> 37:09.688
You keep hand sanitiser
in your sock?

37:09.720 --> 37:10.622
Shut up, Mark.

37:10.922 --> 37:11.755
Shut up.

37:24.687 --> 37:25.387
Missed a bit.

37:34.289 --> 37:35.555
I don't think I can
breathe in here.

37:35.588 --> 37:36.889
I feel so cooped up.

37:38.221 --> 37:39.422
Mate, this is bigger
than your flat.

37:40.288 --> 37:41.188
I think I prefer the decor.

37:41.222 --> 37:43.223
How can you be so fucking calm?

37:45.189 --> 37:46.388
Has it gone tits up?

37:46.921 --> 37:47.588
Yes, it's gone tits up.

37:48.453 --> 37:49.788
Yes, it has gone tits up.

37:50.955 --> 37:54.454
But let's look at this tits-up
situation as a metaphor.

37:54.487 --> 37:57.622
No, this is not a metaphor.
This is a jail cell.

37:58.288 --> 37:59.554
Have you ever considered that I

37:59.587 --> 38:01.354
work in the very same hospital

38:01.388 --> 38:03.155
where we spent most
of our teenage years?

38:03.755 --> 38:05.788
So?

38:05.820 --> 38:07.654
And that you are now too terrified to
walk through the door of said hospital?

38:07.688 --> 38:09.555
No, it is not just
that hospital, Mark.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.855
It is all hospitals.

38:10.888 --> 38:14.822
But my point is that
we're prisoners of the past.

38:16.221 --> 38:19.522
We live in the jail
cells of our minds.

38:20.854 --> 38:21.855
Oh my God.

38:23.788 --> 38:24.888
Another metaphor.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.689
What are we doing?

39:16.387 --> 39:17.621
Who dares wins.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.554
Shh!

39:39.755 --> 39:40.622
What are we doing?

39:45.488 --> 39:46.655
You alright there.

39:48.621 --> 39:52.722
Uh, uh... oh, Doctor...

39:53.421 --> 39:55.254
When am I getting an operation?

39:55.288 --> 39:56.288
Ahh...

39:56.954 --> 39:59.387
Um, well, it's Dr Mark, mate.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.788
And as soon as we get out of this
lift, we'll, uh, amputate your leg.

40:01.820 --> 40:02.821
Whi... which leg?

40:03.820 --> 40:04.787
Um, I don't know.

40:04.821 --> 40:05.787
Which leg do you want?

40:05.820 --> 40:06.688
It's up to you, innit?

40:07.555 --> 40:08.822
Yeah. Quick, quick, we go.

40:08.855 --> 40:10.422
Come on, come on, come on.

40:12.621 --> 40:13.522
See you later, old bullet.

40:13.555 --> 40:14.421
Whoo!

40:24.687 --> 40:25.554
We did it!

40:27.454 --> 40:28.156
Come on!

40:28.189 --> 40:29.189
Get in!

40:29.654 --> 40:30.288
Oh!

40:30.320 --> 40:31.220
This is it, man.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.288
This is... fresh air!

40:33.788 --> 40:34.755
Freedom.

40:35.055 --> 40:35.856
Freedom!

40:36.521 --> 40:37.387
Ha, ha!

40:37.855 --> 40:38.754
- Oh.
- Ah.

40:41.387 --> 40:42.721
So, what do we do now?

40:45.921 --> 40:46.754
Uh...

40:51.520 --> 40:52.222
Go on bikes.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.188
Nah, a bit nippy for that.

41:00.754 --> 41:02.122
Oh God.

41:02.989 --> 41:03.922
I can smell... I can smell it.

41:03.954 --> 41:08.588
I can smell it. Oh my...

41:09.221 --> 41:10.288
There.

41:10.854 --> 41:12.188
Like it never happened.

41:20.254 --> 41:21.255
Oh.

41:22.788 --> 41:24.489
What happens now then?

41:25.220 --> 41:26.187
I ring my lawyer.

41:26.221 --> 41:27.754
He bails us out.
We sleep it off.

41:29.021 --> 41:31.522
And then we say hello to the first
day of the rest of our lives.

41:31.554 --> 41:32.555
No, I mean...

41:33.420 --> 41:36.754
No, I mean what happens
with my illness?

41:39.820 --> 41:44.721
Well... there's bruising.

41:45.220 --> 41:45.921
Hmm.

41:45.955 --> 41:47.388
There is shortness of breath.

41:47.821 --> 41:48.755
Bleeding.

41:49.788 --> 41:50.722
Swelling of the glands.

41:50.755 --> 41:52.421
That's a-a major symptom.

41:54.955 --> 41:57.422
It's... it's hard to
know what happens next.

41:58.187 --> 42:01.454
Yeah. Right. Thanks.

42:04.755 --> 42:05.755
Hmm.

42:06.788 --> 42:08.554
Shame we dropped the money.
We could have had a punt.

42:11.420 --> 42:13.254
Remember when you won
fifty quid at the dogs?

42:13.288 --> 42:15.422
That was a... that
was ages ago, Mark.

42:21.787 --> 42:23.254
What are you...?

42:24.922 --> 42:27.754
I stashed it when-when-
when the fight broke out.

42:27.788 --> 42:30.221
Ben, you are
chock full of surprises.

42:30.253 --> 42:31.687
Sometimes even good ones.

42:31.721 --> 42:32.622
I know.

42:32.655 --> 42:33.655
And you-you have half of that.

42:33.688 --> 42:34.455
And I'll...

42:34.488 --> 42:35.555
Ah, you keep all of it.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.489
You are now officially
the money man.

42:38.955 --> 42:39.555
Yay!

42:39.588 --> 42:40.255
Yay.

42:57.521 --> 42:59.388
There's one. Free Lad.

43:00.420 --> 43:01.722
Seems apt.

43:01.754 --> 43:03.122
Mark, stop slapping
me on my back, okay?

43:04.887 --> 43:05.754
Three-to-one favourite.

43:06.554 --> 43:07.287
Put it on that.

43:09.353 --> 43:09.788
Mark, I said stop
slapping my back.

43:16.855 --> 43:17.689
Do you wanna bet?

43:18.355 --> 43:19.355
I-I've got my own betting slips.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.787
Thank you. I-I-I won fifty
quid here when I was a teenager.

43:21.821 --> 43:23.255
Don't care, mate.

43:23.488 --> 43:24.722
I'm just gonna check
the other half.

43:26.621 --> 43:28.622
Is it... is it definitely
three-to-one on Free Lad?

43:29.721 --> 43:30.722
- Yeah, it's definitely three-to-one on Free Lad.
- Definitely?

43:31.121 --> 43:33.220
Definitely.

43:33.253 --> 43:34.754
Definitely three-to-one
on Free Lad.

43:36.821 --> 43:39.421
Hiya, mate, um, can you budge at
anything on three-to-one on Free Lad?

43:39.955 --> 43:41.321
Three-to-one? Free Lad.

43:41.354 --> 43:42.688
No, that's gonna
stay where it is.

43:42.721 --> 43:43.522
It's gonna end up three-to-one?

43:44.255 --> 43:45.889
Definitely three-to-one.

43:45.922 --> 43:47.188
Okay, I-I won fifty quid
here when I was a teenager.

43:47.221 --> 43:48.689
So, I-I know what
I'm talking about.

43:49.621 --> 43:50.255
Hey.

43:50.854 --> 43:51.588
Mark, get...

43:51.755 --> 43:52.455
Oh.

43:52.721 --> 43:53.489
I'm Sara.

43:54.520 --> 43:55.387
Hello you.

43:55.987 --> 43:58.188
Hello me. And I'm-I'm Ben.

43:58.688 --> 43:59.622
Sorry.

44:00.788 --> 44:02.255
Didn't take you for a
gamblin' man, Ben.

44:02.287 --> 44:03.522
Oh, no, I, um...

44:04.787 --> 44:05.788
I won fifty quid here when I
was a teenager.

44:06.921 --> 44:07.888
I've spent all that
money now, so...

44:08.088 --> 44:08.488
Have you?

44:08.521 --> 44:10.154
You big spender.

44:11.755 --> 44:15.122
We're just here, uh, that's
Madam Edam over there.

44:15.854 --> 44:16.554
Um, she's my boss.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.855
We're just scoping
out the place for...

44:18.887 --> 44:20.255
We're catering in a
couple weeks' time.

44:20.288 --> 44:22.155
And, uh, just thought
we'd come check it out.

44:22.188 --> 44:23.321
Have a quick flutter
while we're here.

44:23.353 --> 44:24.188
Oh, me too.

44:24.220 --> 44:24.889
Really? What are the odds!

44:25.922 --> 44:26.754
Oh, well, if you come with me...

44:27.721 --> 44:29.454
These two ladies will help ya.

44:29.487 --> 44:32.521
And you... you put the amount
you want at the bottom.

44:33.387 --> 44:34.354
And who you're
betting on at the top.

44:34.388 --> 44:35.322
And just ask the ladies.

44:35.887 --> 44:36.754
Okay?

44:37.620 --> 44:41.388
Um, hi, I'd like to
put ten quid on, um...

44:42.653 --> 44:45.754
Yeah, ten pounds on... on Hope
Eternal to win the next race.

44:47.688 --> 44:48.855
I love that name.

44:48.888 --> 44:49.889
Hope Eternal.

44:54.188 --> 44:56.689
Um, can I change my bet to

44:57.555 --> 44:59.154
four thousand, nine hundred

44:59.187 --> 45:02.287
and twenty eight
pounds on Hope Eternal.

45:03.221 --> 45:04.388
Yeah, so just... just
scribble that out.

45:04.421 --> 45:05.789
And change it, thank you.

45:13.521 --> 45:15.421
Sara! Come.

45:30.587 --> 45:32.788
Ben Taylor. Is that really you?

45:33.720 --> 45:35.287
Of course it is, Mark.

45:35.821 --> 45:37.755
Mark, this is Sara.

45:38.286 --> 45:39.754
Sara, this is Mark.

45:40.354 --> 45:41.355
Hello.

45:42.021 --> 45:43.487
Ma... Madame Edam, this is Mark.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.754
- Mark, this is Madame Edam.
- Edam?

45:46.453 --> 45:47.554
Is that supposed to be funny?

45:48.587 --> 45:49.722
I get it.

45:50.388 --> 45:52.188
That's because I'm Dutch, right?

45:52.221 --> 45:53.187
Um, I-I...

45:53.220 --> 45:55.254
My real name is Lotte.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.754
Lotte Windmill.

45:57.787 --> 45:58.654
Okay. I'm...

45:58.688 --> 45:59.855
I'm joking with you.

45:59.887 --> 46:02.421
Now sit down and get
me some fizz.

46:07.287 --> 46:08.754
Sa... Sara, would
you like a top up?

46:09.588 --> 46:10.554
Yes, please.

46:16.721 --> 46:18.722
Oh my God, I've spilled
it on the table.

46:19.654 --> 46:21.254
Oh, yeah, don't
worry, it's fine.

46:21.854 --> 46:23.355
Don't worry.

46:23.387 --> 46:24.754
Oh, sorry.

46:25.921 --> 46:28.221
Ooh, the racing.

46:29.521 --> 46:30.522
Look, it's
starting, it-it's starting.

46:30.554 --> 46:31.488
Come on, Ben.

46:31.521 --> 46:33.488
There, there. There.

46:33.521 --> 46:34.521
Oh, come on,
Sara, they're doing...

46:35.421 --> 46:37.887
Are they?

46:37.921 --> 46:39.188
Hope Eternal.

46:39.788 --> 46:40.388
Hope Eternal.

46:40.421 --> 46:41.355
Yes, yeah.

46:41.388 --> 46:42.155
Any of them could win the race.

46:42.187 --> 46:42.754
Any of them could win.

46:42.787 --> 46:43.854
But we want ours to win.

46:43.886 --> 46:45.755
Free Lad, come on Free Lad.

46:46.053 --> 46:46.887
Come on Hope Eternal.

46:46.921 --> 46:47.821
Five?

46:47.855 --> 46:48.788
- Come on, Hope Eternal.
- Come on, Free Lad!

46:48.820 --> 46:49.689
Track one.

46:49.953 --> 46:50.589
Come on.

46:51.021 --> 46:52.188
Come on, Hope Eternal!

46:52.221 --> 46:52.855
Come on, Hope Eternal.

46:53.920 --> 46:54.887
Yes, I feel beginner's luck.

46:55.687 --> 46:56.853
Beginner's luck.

46:56.886 --> 46:57.887
Go on, Free Lad, come on.

46:57.921 --> 46:58.854
That's right, keep going.

46:58.886 --> 46:59.853
Come on Free Lad!

46:59.887 --> 47:00.655
Come on Hope Eternal.

47:00.687 --> 47:01.422
Go on Hope Eternal!

47:01.886 --> 47:03.355
What?

47:03.387 --> 47:05.454
My bet was in my hand
twenty-five to one.

47:05.487 --> 47:06.687
Oh, for God's sake.

47:06.721 --> 47:07.321
Mark, it could win.

47:07.354 --> 47:07.854
It could win, it could win.

47:07.886 --> 47:08.754
Look, it could win.

47:09.454 --> 47:10.355
See, it's going!

47:10.388 --> 47:11.754
Stick across. Cheesy Wotsits.

47:11.787 --> 47:12.422
Cheesy Wotsits.

47:12.521 --> 47:13.120
Yeah.

47:13.154 --> 47:14.220
See, it's... it's coming.

47:14.253 --> 47:14.854
It's coming in.

47:15.055 --> 47:15.854
It's... it's coming in.

47:17.187 --> 47:18.821
Oh my God. It's
actually coming in.

47:18.853 --> 47:22.820
It's coming in.
Oh, Mark

47:25.521 --> 47:26.787
We won. Oh God...

47:29.555 --> 47:30.854
Twenty-five-to-one.

47:30.886 --> 47:31.786
Oh my God.

47:31.820 --> 47:33.755
Twenty... twenty-five-to-one.

47:34.387 --> 47:35.388
Yeah.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.487
God, I don't believe it.

47:38.521 --> 47:39.288
What are the odds?

47:39.320 --> 47:40.421
Twenty-five-to-one.

47:41.088 --> 47:41.888
Good lord, twenty-five-to-one.

47:42.820 --> 47:43.588
That was your boy, Ben.

47:43.621 --> 47:44.422
That was your boy?

47:45.287 --> 47:46.887
Four thousand, nine hundred
and twenty-eight pounds.

47:47.588 --> 47:49.788
That's nearly £150,000!

47:50.721 --> 47:51.388
We can't give it away.

48:00.520 --> 48:01.288
Yes!

48:01.320 --> 48:02.721
Oh my God.

48:03.454 --> 48:04.255
Oh, my God, Mark.

48:04.854 --> 48:05.589
This is amazing.

48:06.321 --> 48:06.888
New York City.

48:06.921 --> 48:07.787
Fuck, yes.

48:07.819 --> 48:08.654
What?

48:08.688 --> 48:09.655
Wow.

48:09.687 --> 48:11.154
But Manchester will do.

48:12.253 --> 48:13.521
You can see the MEN.

48:14.188 --> 48:15.787
You can actually see the MEN.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.254
Let's see.

48:18.287 --> 48:20.254
Right, champagne,
champagne, champagne.

48:21.554 --> 48:22.387
Yes!

48:22.887 --> 48:24.288
Music!

48:24.954 --> 48:25.622
Don't shake it, don't shake it.

48:26.487 --> 48:27.287
Oh my God, shake...

48:27.454 --> 48:28.221
Don't shake it.

48:28.253 --> 48:28.854
Champagne shower.

48:28.955 --> 48:30.288
Here we go!

48:54.920 --> 48:56.853
I'm on the table doing a dance.

48:56.887 --> 48:58.588
I'm on the table doing a dance.

48:58.620 --> 49:02.522
I'm doing... I'm doing my
penguin dance on the table.

49:08.588 --> 49:11.754
One to the left, one to the
right. One to the left...

49:11.787 --> 49:14.753
I forgot my left
and right routine.

49:23.588 --> 49:24.754
What are you listening to?

49:24.787 --> 49:25.854
What?

49:25.887 --> 49:26.821
What are you listening to?

49:27.753 --> 49:28.720
Come have a listen.

49:28.754 --> 49:29.720
Quick.

49:31.554 --> 49:32.555
Best bit.

49:35.288 --> 49:36.355
Yeah.

49:37.387 --> 49:38.388
Can you dance?

49:39.253 --> 49:40.354
No, I'm rubbish at dancing.

49:40.820 --> 49:41.522
No.

49:42.787 --> 49:43.855
Sit there. Hold that.

49:45.719 --> 49:47.588
One, two, three four...

49:51.753 --> 49:53.220
What are you doing?

49:53.254 --> 49:54.421
Mark, what are doing?

49:54.853 --> 49:56.154
Dancing.

49:56.187 --> 49:56.753
You look like a penguin.

49:56.786 --> 49:58.720
Yeah. That's the point.

49:59.253 --> 50:00.488
Come on, you have a go.

50:01.220 --> 50:01.754
What do I do?

50:01.786 --> 50:02.820
Copy me.

50:07.354 --> 50:08.155
That's it.

50:30.421 --> 50:31.522
This is good.

50:31.554 --> 50:33.121
Yeah, it's good, okay.

50:34.220 --> 50:36.387
This time I am
doing the countdown.

50:36.421 --> 50:37.421
Okay.

50:38.787 --> 50:42.188
On three, two, one.

50:42.221 --> 50:44.188
Oh, no!

50:44.221 --> 50:44.854
A4 paper.

50:44.886 --> 50:46.154
Oh, very nice.

50:46.188 --> 50:47.787
All the way from WH Smith.

50:47.820 --> 50:51.687
The good stuff, 80 GSM.

50:52.321 --> 50:53.522
Very nice.

51:02.754 --> 51:03.821
Okay.

51:03.853 --> 51:04.387
Okay.

51:04.420 --> 51:05.753
This is the equaliser.

51:06.353 --> 51:06.787
Yep.

51:10.387 --> 51:11.221
My count.

51:11.819 --> 51:12.587
Your count.

51:12.619 --> 51:15.221
And three, two...

51:16.619 --> 51:18.587
Ah! Yes!

51:19.554 --> 51:21.754
Okay, two, um, I must take...

51:21.786 --> 51:23.254
Oh, no, no, no.

51:23.287 --> 51:26.254
No accessories. We
said clothes only.

51:28.354 --> 51:30.254
Get them off,
you're naked, bloke.

51:30.920 --> 51:32.686
Take them off. Take them off.

51:32.719 --> 51:33.753
Okay, okay, okay.

51:37.488 --> 51:39.621
Not necessarily naked.

51:43.753 --> 51:48.187
Oh, my, what!

52:05.553 --> 52:06.488
Are you okay?

52:07.720 --> 52:12.188
Um... I'm not sure
I'm up for this.

52:13.220 --> 52:16.288
Okay. Well, that's flattering.

52:17.387 --> 52:18.553
Sorry. It's just...

52:20.587 --> 52:22.888
Well, I've had a tough week.

52:22.921 --> 52:23.753
And...

52:24.886 --> 52:28.354
Well, I'll be in the bathroom
playing my tiny violin.

52:55.953 --> 52:57.686
I was in a relationship once.

52:57.719 --> 52:58.687
Serious.

52:59.254 --> 53:00.754
A serious relationship.

53:02.387 --> 53:03.620
Dead serious.

53:05.854 --> 53:06.753
What happened?

53:11.754 --> 53:14.787
You know. The usual, I think.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.887
He wasn't really
a people person.

53:19.421 --> 53:23.754
Wasn't, you know,
great with humans.

53:26.388 --> 53:27.388
Hmm.

53:30.887 --> 53:31.888
Um...

53:34.854 --> 53:38.754
Right, I have got
something to tell you.

53:40.354 --> 53:42.255
But it's a secret, okay?

53:42.287 --> 53:43.620
What matter of secret?

53:44.487 --> 53:47.654
Right.

53:47.687 --> 53:49.587
You're a double agent
working with the Soviets.

53:51.188 --> 53:53.420
Well, no, 'cause the Soviets
don't exist anymore.

53:56.353 --> 53:57.820
You've been sent from
the future to the present

53:57.853 --> 53:59.753
to save mankind
from an evil robber

53:59.787 --> 54:01.487
who's also been sent
from the future.

54:01.519 --> 54:02.654
No, that's...

54:02.686 --> 54:04.287
That was The Terminator.

54:04.820 --> 54:06.188
Sara Connor.

54:06.220 --> 54:07.355
Sara Connor.

54:13.287 --> 54:14.753
Shit, you're married.

54:20.853 --> 54:22.354
I am dying of cancer.

54:23.519 --> 54:26.753
And I don't have long left.

54:29.886 --> 54:33.254
Yeah, okay.

54:34.486 --> 54:36.154
Is that what you tell all the
girls so they'll sleep with you?

54:36.188 --> 54:36.754
No.

54:38.620 --> 54:40.220
No, I don't.

54:43.787 --> 54:45.754
Would that work, though?

54:46.387 --> 54:47.821
If I did?

54:59.586 --> 55:00.721
You have exactly two minutes

55:00.753 --> 55:01.754
to explain why you're
calling me at...

55:02.619 --> 55:03.255
two a.m.

55:03.288 --> 55:04.488
You're right.

55:05.587 --> 55:07.888
About the prism thing.

55:09.819 --> 55:11.753
But it is not what you think.

55:13.387 --> 55:16.821
Ever since, you know, being ill

55:16.853 --> 55:18.754
as a teenager at hospital,

55:20.520 --> 55:25.520
I learned that nothing
ever lasts forever.

55:27.719 --> 55:28.720
I...

55:30.687 --> 55:33.855
Anything can just
fall apart at any time.

55:34.787 --> 55:35.787
So...

55:38.786 --> 55:41.854
So, I avoided
anything meaningful

55:42.853 --> 55:47.754
or, you know, until...

55:51.619 --> 55:53.254
till you got under my skin.

55:58.554 --> 56:00.188
Are you okay?

56:02.719 --> 56:03.686
Mark?

56:03.719 --> 56:05.353
Mark, what's wrong?

56:05.953 --> 56:07.319
Come on, stud.

56:07.353 --> 56:08.320
Let's get you inside.

56:08.352 --> 56:09.786
Mark.

56:09.820 --> 56:10.888
You'll catch your death out
here with just pants on.

56:11.954 --> 56:12.821
- Hmm.
- Come on.

56:14.286 --> 56:15.253
Okay.

56:15.287 --> 56:16.754
Come.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.721
Morning, kid.

57:01.754 --> 57:05.588
Mark, I feel grand.

57:06.553 --> 57:07.554
Terrific.

57:09.219 --> 57:10.687
I've got it.

57:11.420 --> 57:12.621
Your sponge ball?

57:12.654 --> 57:16.554
No, I have got it
with the ladies.

57:17.720 --> 57:19.187
Oh, so you and Sara...

57:19.220 --> 57:21.187
We kissed and...

57:21.886 --> 57:22.887
this.

57:27.387 --> 57:27.888
Test results.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.319
No, no, no, no.

57:29.353 --> 57:30.788
She-she wrote her
number on the back.

57:31.854 --> 57:32.888
Oh, look, and she's...

57:32.920 --> 57:34.487
She's written an
X after her name.

57:34.621 --> 57:36.220
Unless... is that
how you spell it?

57:36.253 --> 57:37.320
Sara X.

57:37.352 --> 57:38.353
Sara X.

57:38.887 --> 57:41.853
Mate, I do believe that

57:41.886 --> 57:44.620
you have well and truly pulled.

57:44.653 --> 57:45.920
I've pulled.

57:45.953 --> 57:46.620
And they said it
couldn't be done.

57:46.653 --> 57:47.721
Who said that?

57:48.021 --> 57:49.122
No one.

57:50.719 --> 57:52.855
How do we celebrate
this momentous occasion?

57:54.719 --> 57:56.186
We go bike riding.

57:56.219 --> 57:56.786
Bike riding.

57:56.820 --> 57:57.821
We go bike riding.

57:57.854 --> 57:58.753
Mountain bikes.

57:58.786 --> 58:00.353
Real live mountain bikes.

58:00.387 --> 58:01.254
Not the shit ones.

58:01.286 --> 58:01.853
Not the shit ones.

58:01.886 --> 58:02.853
Not the miniature ones.

58:02.887 --> 58:03.888
Real mountain bikes.

58:03.920 --> 58:04.753
The best in the shop.

58:04.787 --> 58:05.654
Mountain bikes.

58:05.686 --> 58:06.287
Yes!

58:06.319 --> 58:06.854
Now.

58:06.886 --> 58:08.187
Come on, now, let's go.

58:08.819 --> 58:09.454
Shit.

58:21.487 --> 58:22.254
Whoo!

58:22.287 --> 58:23.753
Whoo!

58:24.886 --> 58:26.754
Mark! Mark!

58:28.886 --> 58:29.753
Watch this.

58:31.352 --> 58:32.820
Yes, go Ben, go!

58:33.486 --> 58:34.753
Yeah!

58:38.854 --> 58:41.221
I'm right behind
you, pulling up.

58:51.787 --> 58:53.354
Mark!

58:53.921 --> 58:55.687
Yes!

59:04.921 --> 59:09.854
Whoo! Down here.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.754
Ooh.

59:17.786 --> 59:18.787
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:18.820 --> 59:19.621
Mark, you... you alright?

59:20.787 --> 59:22.721
Ah, that looks really bad.

59:22.754 --> 59:24.387
That looks really bad.

59:24.419 --> 59:26.153
Hey, do you... do you want me
to get a plaster out the front?

59:28.487 --> 59:29.754
It's just a scratch, mate.

59:30.453 --> 59:31.421
Are you sure? I've got loads.

59:38.486 --> 59:39.753
We found a beach, Ben.

59:39.786 --> 59:41.253
Yeah, it's beautiful.

59:41.786 --> 59:42.787
Absolutely beautiful.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.420
Sara X.

01:00:09.854 --> 01:00:10.753
Ring her.

01:00:10.786 --> 01:00:12.253
I haven't got a signal, have I?

01:00:28.353 --> 01:00:30.221
O positive. Mark.

01:00:32.853 --> 01:00:34.920
I'm... I'm O negative.

01:00:34.954 --> 01:00:37.253
Only-only seven percent of the
world's population is O negative.

01:00:40.886 --> 01:00:42.888
The hospital wouldn't get
it wrong, would they?

01:00:44.587 --> 01:00:45.488
Mark.

01:00:46.953 --> 01:00:48.753
Un-unless one of the doctors...

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.187
He lied about the test results

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.254
and convinced his best
friend that he was dying!

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.721
Why would you do this, Mark?

01:01:02.286 --> 01:01:06.554
No, no, you... you
are gonna tell me why!

01:01:06.853 --> 01:01:07.854
Why!?

01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:12.620
I didn't mean to
from the outset.

01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:15.120
Things just snowballed.

01:01:15.853 --> 01:01:16.720
Snowballed!?

01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:18.553
Yes, snowballed.

01:01:18.586 --> 01:01:21.787
You convinced me
that I was dying.

01:01:22.754 --> 01:01:23.754
You fuck...

01:01:24.286 --> 01:01:25.620
You sold all my stuff.

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:27.254
You-you got me...

01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:29.587
You got me fired from my job.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.187
You tried to throw
me off a roof!

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.486
That's not snowballed, Mark.

01:01:34.519 --> 01:01:36.853
That's a fucking avalanche!

01:01:36.886 --> 01:01:38.520
It's an avalanche.

01:01:38.921 --> 01:01:40.286
Avalanche.

01:01:44.252 --> 01:01:44.854
Let's just go.

01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:47.754
You fucking...!

01:01:48.452 --> 01:01:50.853
You fucking...

01:01:50.887 --> 01:01:53.621
What are you doing?

01:01:54.787 --> 01:01:55.787
You selfish...

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.754
Get off me!

01:01:57.186 --> 01:01:57.821
Get off me now.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.821
Coming close to a century now.

01:02:01.854 --> 01:02:03.787
This is the most impressive innings
Old Trafford's seen all year.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.620
And I'm still two runs short.

01:02:08.853 --> 01:02:11.854
Whoa. Quite content with
a quick single to ninety-nine.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.721
Ben, what are you
doing out of bed again?

01:02:16.252 --> 01:02:17.753
Making cricket history.

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:20.453
Yeah, very good,
back to bed now.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:21.287
Nurse.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.721
I think the innings
is over, Mark.

01:02:23.019 --> 01:02:24.753
No one remembers ninety-nine
not out, do they?

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.387
Of course they do, mate.

01:02:27.386 --> 01:02:28.420
Yeah, well, I wish you'd
realise how ill you are.

01:02:29.087 --> 01:02:30.588
Chemo's not Lucozade, you know.

01:02:31.453 --> 01:02:32.553
It lowers your resistance.

01:02:32.586 --> 01:02:33.753
Make you more
susceptible to germs.

01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:36.855
Come on, get you
up, one two, three.

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:38.286
There we go.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.887
His temperature's off the roof.

01:02:40.919 --> 01:02:42.520
Can you grab the trolley?

01:02:44.919 --> 01:02:46.420
Can't you just leave him alone?

01:02:47.654 --> 01:02:49.354
We need to get medicine into his
veins to make him feel better.

01:02:49.386 --> 01:02:51.286
Now, I'd really like it if
you'd go back to bed, Mark.

01:02:51.819 --> 01:02:52.687
No. Don't leave, Mark!

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.753
Please.

01:02:56.419 --> 01:02:58.186
Please.

01:02:58.219 --> 01:03:00.254
Well, come on then, Mr Doherty,
do something to take his mind of it.

01:03:03.252 --> 01:03:04.253
I don't...

01:03:06.353 --> 01:03:08.586
Right, we're gonna count
down from ninety-nine.

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:09.486
Yeah?

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.419
Yeah.

01:03:10.452 --> 01:03:12.186
Ninety-nine, ninety-eight.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.453
Ninety-six, ninety-five.

01:03:14.486 --> 01:03:15.286
I've got access.

01:03:15.953 --> 01:03:16.688
Keep counting. Ninety-four.

01:03:17.086 --> 01:03:18.520
Ninety-three.

01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:19.220
Ninety-two.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:20.219
- Ninety-two.

01:03:20.252 --> 01:03:20.753
- Ninety-one.
- Ninety-one.

01:03:20.786 --> 01:03:22.253
Ninety.

01:03:22.286 --> 01:03:23.687
Move out the way, Mark.

01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:26.720
Hold this, grab this, yeah.

01:03:26.753 --> 01:03:28.819
Pretend that it's my hand
and squeeze it, yeah.

01:03:52.352 --> 01:03:56.720
Well done, Dr Doherty.

01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:57.887
Eighty-two.

01:03:58.885 --> 01:04:00.219
Eighty-one.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:01.621
Nine...

01:04:02.487 --> 01:04:05.654
Eighty-nine, eighty-seven.

01:04:05.687 --> 01:04:07.520
Eighty-six.

01:04:26.419 --> 01:04:28.687
When were you going
to tell me, Mark?

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.887
Tell me you're at least
a little bit relieved.

01:04:35.819 --> 01:04:37.553
No, I'm outraged!

01:04:38.085 --> 01:04:39.319
Ben, you've done more

01:04:39.352 --> 01:04:40.487
in these last three days

01:04:40.519 --> 01:04:41.753
than you've done in
the last fifteen years.

01:04:43.852 --> 01:04:45.554
You've met a girl,
for God's sake!

01:04:52.486 --> 01:04:53.785
Just take your clothes
off and dry them.

01:04:53.819 --> 01:04:54.753
I'm fine.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.488
You're not fine.
You're-you're bloody freezing.

01:04:59.352 --> 01:05:00.752
Your fucking fault I'm wet.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:07.752
You can hang them up.

01:05:19.486 --> 01:05:20.752
That's for lying to me.

01:05:20.785 --> 01:05:23.687
Now your pants, they are
literally on fire.

01:05:27.718 --> 01:05:28.719
My-my sponge ball!

01:05:29.586 --> 01:05:30.488
My sponge ball, you idiot.

01:05:30.885 --> 01:05:31.719
You idiot.

01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:34.219
Oh Lord, save the
precious sponge ball.

01:05:34.252 --> 01:05:36.386
I know I have my quirks, Mark.

01:05:37.553 --> 01:05:39.153
But what harm have
I ever done you?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.720
Your quirks have robbed
me of my best mate.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.253
Yeah, well, at least
I'm not a liar.

01:05:45.885 --> 01:05:48.586
Or-or-or a commitment-phobe who

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.587
would not know a
good woman if she

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.187
hit him in the
face with a shovel.

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:54.787
Which is what Jade
should do to you.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.286
You know what?

01:05:56.919 --> 01:06:01.321
Every boring Wednesday
with you does my nut in.

01:06:02.186 --> 01:06:03.853
Because you're the weirdo.

01:06:04.519 --> 01:06:05.785
Yeah.

01:06:05.819 --> 01:06:08.521
Well, me too, me... me-me
too you fucking idiot.

01:06:08.553 --> 01:06:09.319
Get off me, Ben!

01:06:09.353 --> 01:06:10.753
Get off, argh!

01:06:14.353 --> 01:06:18.187
Get up, I barely
touched you, Mark.

01:06:26.818 --> 01:06:28.620
I'm the one who's dying.

01:06:30.785 --> 01:06:32.720
You stop that.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.588
Stop it, you...

01:06:35.319 --> 01:06:36.787
One lie is enough.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.420
It's enough!

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:40.852
Just think about it, Ben!

01:06:40.886 --> 01:06:42.853
Leave me alone.

01:06:42.886 --> 01:06:44.753
You fucking leave me alone.

01:06:50.718 --> 01:06:52.587
Leave me alone, Mark!

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.886
Argh.

01:07:07.853 --> 01:07:09.354
I'm not the weirdo.

01:07:10.952 --> 01:07:11.619
You're the weirdo.

01:07:42.252 --> 01:07:42.820
Stop!

01:07:42.853 --> 01:07:43.787
Please stop!

01:07:44.719 --> 01:07:45.487
Thank you so much.

01:07:46.219 --> 01:07:46.753
Thank you so much.

01:08:18.352 --> 01:08:20.286
Thank you, cheers.

01:08:36.818 --> 01:08:38.685
Have I gotta put that
in my car as well?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.153
Yeah.

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:45.752
Look, I know this might
be weird timing and all.

01:08:46.452 --> 01:08:46.886
But you and I...

01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:48.854
It's not gonna be a thing.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.220
Really?

01:08:53.386 --> 01:08:55.187
I expected you a
bit more glamorous.

01:08:58.786 --> 01:08:59.787
Fair enough.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.354
Sara!

01:10:27.752 --> 01:10:28.852
Would you like to
see the dessert menu?

01:10:28.885 --> 01:10:29.852
No, thank you.

01:10:29.885 --> 01:10:30.652
No? Another drink?

01:10:30.686 --> 01:10:31.586
Uh, yes, please.

01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:33.120
Okay, good.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.753
Your hamster's back.

01:10:37.685 --> 01:10:40.221
Looking for somewhere
to store his nuts.

01:10:52.819 --> 01:10:56.687
So, you'd like the two glasses
and a, uh, a bottle of the...

01:10:57.652 --> 01:10:58.418
Shiraz.

01:10:58.452 --> 01:11:00.220
Shiraz. Right, yes.

01:11:00.252 --> 01:11:01.820
That will be right with you.

01:11:36.686 --> 01:11:39.420
Oh, behold the Messiah.

01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:46.186
Here's your wine.

01:11:51.718 --> 01:11:52.686
Hello.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:53.886
Hello.

01:11:54.785 --> 01:11:57.519
I wa-I was just passing by.

01:11:57.553 --> 01:12:01.552
I thought I would pop in for
a portion of Hope Eternal.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:03.121
Yeah, it's good with gravy.

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:06.419
And-and peas.

01:12:16.686 --> 01:12:17.753
You okay?

01:12:34.885 --> 01:12:37.420
Mark, you look
knackered, go home.

01:12:39.285 --> 01:12:39.785
I am home.

01:12:49.886 --> 01:12:51.620
Can you get a porter?

01:13:01.885 --> 01:13:03.587
Do you wanna tell
me what's going on?

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.487
I have tiny bit of leukaemia.

01:13:09.019 --> 01:13:10.519
Why didn't you tell me?

01:13:11.919 --> 01:13:13.252
I tried.

01:13:14.253 --> 01:13:16.520
Will you ring Ben and
just tell him it's...

01:13:17.052 --> 01:13:17.686
Tell him it's Wednesday.

01:13:18.086 --> 01:13:19.752
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:33.352 --> 01:13:35.487
Mark, I told you I am not...

01:13:36.518 --> 01:13:37.752
Yeah, speaking.

01:13:39.586 --> 01:13:40.587
Really?

01:13:41.253 --> 01:13:43.154
No, of-of course, I'll-I'll...

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:45.186
Yeah, I'll be there right
away, of course, yeah.

01:13:45.219 --> 01:13:46.220
Okay.

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:48.520
Excu... excuse me!

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.752
Uh, ninety-nine.

01:13:50.852 --> 01:13:51.853
Ninety-six.

01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:53.753
Ninety-seven.

01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.720
Ninety-three.

01:13:56.485 --> 01:13:57.487
Ninety.

01:13:58.385 --> 01:13:59.385
Eighty-seven.

01:14:13.619 --> 01:14:14.620
Ninety-six.

01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:16.720
Ninety-three.

01:14:17.285 --> 01:14:18.285
Ninety.

01:14:18.886 --> 01:14:19.686
Eighty-seven.

01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:20.687
Eighty-four.

01:14:21.086 --> 01:14:21.852
Eighty-one.

01:14:21.885 --> 01:14:22.919
Move, get out my way!

01:14:22.953 --> 01:14:23.686
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:14:23.718 --> 01:14:24.720
I'm so sorry.

01:14:26.218 --> 01:14:27.220
I'm sorry.

01:14:34.752 --> 01:14:35.753
I'm such a dickhead.

01:14:41.752 --> 01:14:42.752
Sorry.

01:14:55.286 --> 01:14:57.719
No, oh, sorry.

01:15:08.218 --> 01:15:09.854
Sorry, thanks, sorry, sorry.

01:15:14.752 --> 01:15:15.753
Hiya.

01:15:16.284 --> 01:15:18.752
Um, you have a visitor.

01:15:20.852 --> 01:15:21.686
Hello, Mark.

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:25.386
I'm just gonna have to
sit downon that chair.

01:15:25.785 --> 01:15:26.752
I'll be okay.

01:15:27.752 --> 01:15:29.253
Hello, hello, I'll be okay.

01:15:30.718 --> 01:15:32.519
I'll be okay, I'll be okay.

01:15:33.352 --> 01:15:35.720
Ben in hospital?

01:15:37.719 --> 01:15:38.720
Oh.

01:15:43.785 --> 01:15:44.819
You look like shit, mate.

01:15:46.919 --> 01:15:48.685
You... you look even worse.

01:15:53.485 --> 01:15:55.219
You won't be on your own.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:57.787
You be on your own.

01:15:58.853 --> 01:15:59.854
So, you're not on your own.

01:16:06.618 --> 01:16:11.619
Sometimes you only realise how
happy you are in retrospect.

01:16:17.219 --> 01:16:18.753
Venice was perfect.

01:16:21.385 --> 01:16:23.752
The best week of
my life.

01:16:25.685 --> 01:16:30.687
Jade, wine, food, sex.

01:16:30.952 --> 01:16:31.919
Hmm.

01:16:31.952 --> 01:16:33.686
Gondolas, pigeons.

01:16:33.953 --> 01:16:34.753
What?

01:16:38.251 --> 01:16:40.552
I've really ballsed up
everything in my life.

01:16:40.585 --> 01:16:43.219
No, that's not true.

01:16:44.186 --> 01:16:45.186
Fairly true.

01:16:45.652 --> 01:16:46.419
No.

01:16:48.853 --> 01:16:51.753
When you weren't lying to
me about the terminal illness

01:16:53.885 --> 01:16:55.552
you were actually a
really good mate.

01:16:58.285 --> 01:16:59.285
Really good.

01:17:06.286 --> 01:17:09.186
That's the nicest thing anyone's
ever said to me.

01:17:17.351 --> 01:17:19.452
I need you and Sara to
help with me with something.

01:17:20.652 --> 01:17:24.186
It doesn't have anything to do
with sex or pigeons, does it?

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.653
It might do, actually.

01:17:29.318 --> 01:17:29.753
Might do.

01:17:30.852 --> 01:17:35.619
Brr, brr, brr, brr.

01:17:41.553 --> 01:17:42.686
Hello, what are you doing here?

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:44.620
Hello. Just waiting for you.

01:17:46.518 --> 01:17:47.520
You alright?

01:17:49.618 --> 01:17:54.352
Um, I thought these would
sound better coming from you.

01:17:55.553 --> 01:17:57.720
Nothing to do with cancer
sounds better coming from me.

01:17:58.118 --> 01:17:58.819
Just read it.

01:18:01.585 --> 01:18:02.552
Hmm.

01:18:04.385 --> 01:18:06.752
Okay. Thanks.

01:18:13.818 --> 01:18:15.653
Javan, Mrs Kitchen.

01:18:16.853 --> 01:18:18.219
What's with the garb, Doc?

01:18:19.952 --> 01:18:23.253
A new hospital initiative, to get us
to empathise better with patients.

01:18:24.718 --> 01:18:25.886
I'm taking the initiative
very seriously, mate.

01:18:27.285 --> 01:18:28.752
Right, there's something
I wanna show you.

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:36.253
Take a look at these.

01:18:36.918 --> 01:18:38.119
Look easy.

01:18:39.352 --> 01:18:40.887
I don't-I don't see anything.

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:44.286
Exactly.

01:18:45.451 --> 01:18:46.886
Your cancer is in
remission, mate.

01:18:47.819 --> 01:18:48.820
That sounds so good.

01:18:48.853 --> 01:18:50.487
It's better than good.

01:18:51.153 --> 01:18:52.653
You're gonna be fine. It worked.

01:18:55.351 --> 01:18:55.918
Oh, thank God.

01:18:55.952 --> 01:18:57.185
But what about you?

01:19:00.885 --> 01:19:04.253
Me. I have a plan.

01:19:08.686 --> 01:19:09.586
Hi, I'm Sara.

01:19:09.618 --> 01:19:10.785
I am Ben's friend.

01:19:10.818 --> 01:19:12.485
Well, we're sort of
more than friends.

01:19:12.518 --> 01:19:13.653
We haven't really
discussed labels.

01:19:13.686 --> 01:19:15.153
Anyway, I also know Mark.

01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:16.219
And you need to
come with me now.

01:19:17.218 --> 01:19:17.719
It's a matter of love and death.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.219
What?

01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:20.519
Uh, life and death, sorry,
got to come. Come on.

01:19:21.186 --> 01:19:21.753
Uh, yeah.

01:19:22.785 --> 01:19:23.854
Alright, great, um...

01:19:29.818 --> 01:19:31.453
It's just down this way here.

01:19:31.485 --> 01:19:33.352
Okay. Yeah, okay.

01:19:33.385 --> 01:19:34.719
Okay, now I have to
put this on you.

01:19:35.119 --> 01:19:36.553
Oh, um, what?

01:19:37.752 --> 01:19:38.753
Uh, it's supposed
to be a surprise.

01:19:39.785 --> 01:19:41.353
Okay, I-I thought it was
supposed to be an emergency.

01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:42.519
Yes, it is that.

01:19:42.553 --> 01:19:43.753
It's a-it's a
surprise emergency.

01:19:44.952 --> 01:19:45.720
Okay, it's an
emergency surprise.

01:19:45.752 --> 01:19:46.486
Oh, alright, yeah.

01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:50.219
I'm gonna fall.

01:19:50.251 --> 01:19:50.851
You're mak... you're
making me feel dizzy.

01:19:50.884 --> 01:19:51.652
Oh, sorry.

01:19:51.685 --> 01:19:52.453
No, it's alright.

01:19:52.486 --> 01:19:52.886
There's grass there.

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:53.752
Okay.

01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:54.686
Keep going.

01:19:55.951 --> 01:19:57.752
And, great, and you stop.

01:19:58.319 --> 01:19:58.787
Okay.

01:20:00.385 --> 01:20:00.886
Um...

01:20:02.918 --> 01:20:03.787
Hello.

01:20:09.286 --> 01:20:10.286
Hello.

01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:13.553
Do I get a last request
before you shoot me?

01:20:14.419 --> 01:20:15.719
What is your last request?

01:20:15.918 --> 01:20:16.787
I would like you not
to shoot me, please.

01:20:18.251 --> 01:20:19.552
Request denied.

01:20:20.619 --> 01:20:21.386
Are you ready, Ben?

01:20:21.418 --> 01:20:24.552
Uh, yeah. Ready. Aim...

01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:25.752
Hold on just a minute.

01:20:26.018 --> 01:20:26.720
Fire!

01:20:31.219 --> 01:20:32.819
Oh my God.

01:20:34.286 --> 01:20:35.586
Bo-bonjourno Jade.

01:20:35.618 --> 01:20:36.819
Oh, hello.

01:20:39.852 --> 01:20:41.120
Oh, oh.

01:20:57.817 --> 01:20:59.918
And Ben's promised not to sing.

01:20:59.952 --> 01:21:00.720
Sorry, Mark.

01:21:01.519 --> 01:21:02.386
Just like the manual.

01:21:06.817 --> 01:21:08.453
Meet us at the first bridge.

01:21:09.285 --> 01:21:10.252
Aye-aye captain.

01:21:11.519 --> 01:21:14.353
First bridge.

01:21:22.552 --> 01:21:24.519
You're making it really
hard for to hate you.

01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:29.751
Well, instead of hating me...

01:21:32.552 --> 01:21:33.719
Why not humour me?

01:21:35.918 --> 01:21:36.686
Okay.

01:21:39.784 --> 01:21:44.751
Solely for the duration of this
gondola ride, will you be mine?

01:21:49.552 --> 01:21:53.751
Um... yeah, I
think I will, Mark.

01:21:55.785 --> 01:21:59.751
But only for the duration
of this gondola ride.

01:22:01.752 --> 01:22:03.686
Right, well, I need to make sure
that this gondola ride doesn't end.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:05.751
Keep punting, Ben, go!

01:22:06.652 --> 01:22:07.552
Welcome to Venice.

01:22:09.519 --> 01:22:10.219
Would you like it?

01:22:10.251 --> 01:22:10.752
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:22:10.784 --> 01:22:11.785
Please.

01:22:19.218 --> 01:22:20.219
It's perfect.

01:22:21.618 --> 01:22:22.620
I'm such an idiot.

01:22:23.919 --> 01:22:24.719
Hey.

01:22:25.984 --> 01:22:30.352
I wish I had have just asked you
when we went to pro-proper Venice.

01:22:32.718 --> 01:22:33.719
I'm sorry.

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:37.119
I've wasted so much time worrying
about what could go wrong.

01:22:43.418 --> 01:22:44.619
Promise me something.

01:22:47.885 --> 01:22:52.886
Whatever happens, promise
me you'll be happy.

01:22:56.717 --> 01:22:57.751
Stop that please.

01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:24.587
Tour up.

01:23:25.884 --> 01:23:26.718
Is it?

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:27.686
That's Venice.

01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:29.418
Close your eyes.

01:23:29.452 --> 01:23:30.619
Close your eyes and
you're there.

01:23:31.486 --> 01:23:32.586
Go on, close your eyes,
close your eyes.

01:23:32.618 --> 01:23:33.886
My eyes are closed, Mark.

01:23:36.752 --> 01:23:37.752
Whoo!

01:23:40.352 --> 01:23:41.353
You made it!

01:23:45.386 --> 01:23:47.684
Hey, I thought of everything.

01:23:47.718 --> 01:23:49.120
I thought of everything.

01:23:54.285 --> 01:23:55.719
You made us crash, Ben.

01:23:56.652 --> 01:23:59.619
Yeah, I know, it looks
easier in the cool ads, Mark.

01:24:07.851 --> 01:24:08.853
Do you believe in God?

01:24:10.219 --> 01:24:12.752
God? What, the other person?

01:24:13.152 --> 01:24:13.786
I'm serious.

01:24:17.717 --> 01:24:18.585
Don't know.

01:24:20.851 --> 01:24:21.751
Okay, I used to.

01:24:22.785 --> 01:24:23.751
As a kid.

01:24:25.285 --> 01:24:26.751
I'm not really too
sure about it now.

01:24:27.318 --> 01:24:29.285
Well, what I do know.

01:24:29.752 --> 01:24:30.552
What?

01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:33.618
As long as one of us is still
around then we're living.

01:24:34.784 --> 01:24:36.552
Hey, as long as
we both have fun.

01:24:37.752 --> 01:24:38.586
I'm sure there'll
be cheesy Wotsits.

01:24:44.551 --> 01:24:46.352
I will never forget you.

01:24:47.851 --> 01:24:51.752
I have written your name
on the palm of my hands.

01:24:53.185 --> 01:24:55.752
Isaiah, 42:16.

01:24:58.785 --> 01:24:59.751
It's still there.

01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:01.786
Sixteen years.

01:25:08.884 --> 01:25:11.353
There's one more thing
that we have to do.

01:25:14.418 --> 01:25:15.419
Right?

01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:17.353
Are you sure about this?

01:25:22.186 --> 01:25:23.186
Full circuit.

01:25:24.351 --> 01:25:25.718
Mark, you can't do
a full circuit.

01:25:26.884 --> 01:25:28.252
Are you scared I'm
gonna beat you?

01:25:28.285 --> 01:25:29.853
Right, full circuit.

01:25:32.517 --> 01:25:33.519
You hear that?

01:25:33.784 --> 01:25:35.353
What?

01:25:35.385 --> 01:25:36.485
They're under starter's orders.

01:25:37.518 --> 01:25:38.586
Oh, yeah, I hear it.

01:25:39.884 --> 01:25:42.185
Let's go in five...

01:25:43.751 --> 01:25:44.752
Four...

01:25:45.386 --> 01:25:45.819
Three...

01:25:45.851 --> 01:25:46.685
Let's just go.

01:25:47.219 --> 01:25:48.420
Right, yeah, let's go.

01:25:49.951 --> 01:25:51.919
I think
that'll go down as a false start.

01:25:51.952 --> 01:25:53.719
But I don't
think anyone's going to stop them.

01:25:55.185 --> 01:25:56.185
Underwear, Ben.

01:25:59.918 --> 01:26:01.585
Both pairs.

01:26:02.585 --> 01:26:03.886
The crowd are loving it.

01:26:03.918 --> 01:26:04.751
Eyes off, ladies.

01:26:05.852 --> 01:26:07.619
Out the way.

01:26:07.651 --> 01:26:08.851
Nothing's
gonna stand in our way this time.

01:26:08.885 --> 01:26:09.752
Thank... thanks Pete.

01:26:10.518 --> 01:26:11.153
Chee-cheers mate.

01:26:11.186 --> 01:26:13.752
Whay! Whoo!

01:26:14.518 --> 01:26:15.353
Turn around.

01:26:15.919 --> 01:26:17.652
Whoo, hoo, hoo!

01:26:17.685 --> 01:26:19.886
The
adulation of the crowd is palpable.

01:26:19.919 --> 01:26:21.552
I'm beginning to think that

01:26:21.584 --> 01:26:24.353
you tipped people off
that we'd be racing today.

01:26:25.218 --> 01:26:26.385
And why would somebody
do that, hey?

01:26:27.085 --> 01:26:28.518
The fans there to greet them.

01:26:40.285 --> 01:26:41.286
Leaflet?

01:26:42.517 --> 01:26:43.751
Caio Bella.

01:26:44.952 --> 01:26:47.385
She is way out of
your league, mate.

01:26:47.418 --> 01:26:48.752
Way out of your league.

01:26:49.885 --> 01:26:51.386
BOY, you can say that again.

01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:53.752
Full marks for trying, though.

01:27:00.584 --> 01:27:03.551
Just cause you're ill, mate,
doesn't mean I'm gonna let you win.

01:27:05.618 --> 01:27:06.519
Ben.

01:27:09.318 --> 01:27:10.186
You forgot something.

01:27:10.651 --> 01:27:11.285
What?

01:27:11.319 --> 01:27:12.386
Get over this.

01:27:12.852 --> 01:27:13.719
Shit!

01:27:14.718 --> 01:27:15.684
Oh, I can't believe he's

01:27:15.717 --> 01:27:16.618
fallen for that again.

01:27:19.584 --> 01:27:21.786
The finishing
line is now in front of them.

01:27:26.817 --> 01:27:29.153
The moment that they've waited

01:27:29.185 --> 01:27:30.818
for, for sixteen years.

01:27:35.352 --> 01:27:36.419
It's over!

01:27:39.884 --> 01:27:43.185
Nothing
got in the way of their ambition.

01:27:45.517 --> 01:27:50.519
Because this
time... this time they've done it.

01:28:00.285 --> 01:28:01.652
Ben...

01:28:12.752 --> 01:28:14.618
Ben. What are you doing?

01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:22.418
Mark used to love it up here.

01:28:22.952 --> 01:28:23.886
Yeah, yeah, he did.

01:28:30.752 --> 01:28:32.752
Fuck it. Fuck it.

01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:33.853
Ben!

01:28:34.253 --> 01:28:35.186
What are you doing?

01:28:36.252 --> 01:28:36.886
Ben!

01:28:36.918 --> 01:28:37.885
Ninety-nine!

01:28:38.552 --> 01:28:39.186
No!

01:28:39.218 --> 01:28:39.685
A hundred!

01:28:40.417 --> 01:28:41.751
Oh my God.

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.718
Goodbye, sponge ball!

01:28:52.752 --> 01:28:54.220
I'm sorry. Come here.

01:28:54.885 --> 01:28:56.452
Come here, Sara, come here.

01:29:11.873 --> 01:29:16.873
