00:03.504 --> 00:05.504
Today we have two
special guests

00:05.506 --> 00:07.706
With a very special
announcement.

00:07.708 --> 00:11.243
Everypony, welcome the head
of the equestria games,

00:11.245 --> 00:12.778
Ms. Harshwhinny.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.445
<i>(door opens)</i>

00:17.317 --> 00:18.784
Thank you.

00:18.786 --> 00:23.355
Now I'm sure you all
know about the equestria games,

00:23.357 --> 00:26.492
Where ponies from all over
the land compete for glory

00:26.494 --> 00:28.494
In various athletic pursuits?

00:30.063 --> 00:34.033
Well, now you littlest ones will
have the chance to compete

00:34.035 --> 00:37.269
For a weighty responsibility
of your very own.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.638
<i>Rainbow dash: Oh, c'mon!</i>
<i>Tell them the fun part!</i>

00:42.276 --> 00:45.444
<i>(ooh and aah from the others)</i>

00:45.446 --> 00:49.281
All you gotta do is show
ms. Harshwhinny the coolest,

00:49.283 --> 00:52.051
Most spectacular,
most rockin' routine

00:52.053 --> 00:54.119
And you're goin' to
the games!

00:54.121 --> 00:56.789
So, who's gonna be
the lucky ponies?

00:56.791 --> 00:58.690
It's got to be me.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.359
Maybe it's me.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.161
Maybe it's us!

Oh, you are gonna love this!

01:58.419 --> 02:03.789
Will you please curb
your overenthusiastic outbursts!

02:03.791 --> 02:07.559
Now then, let me be
clear on the rules.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.129
You ponies will form teams.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.532
<i>Each team will create</i>
<i>their own flag-carrying routine.</i>

02:13.534 --> 02:18.504
<i>Everypony will be judged on</i>
<i>grace, style, and originality.</i>

02:18.506 --> 02:20.739
There's a most complicated
scoring system,

02:20.741 --> 02:23.842
Which I will elaborate
upon now. Firstly...

02:23.844 --> 02:26.278
Aw, get to the
nitty gritty later.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.715
Tell them the important
stuff: Like who's the coach?

02:29.717 --> 02:30.916
<i>(whistle blast)</i>

02:30.918 --> 02:33.285
That's right: Me!

02:33.287 --> 02:36.388
And you know why I'm
qualified to coach you?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.724
Guess who carried the
cloudsdale flag in the games

02:38.726 --> 02:40.559
When  <u>she</u> was a little filly.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.294
Me!

02:42.296 --> 02:43.795
I'll never forget it.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.631
I burst into the stadium...

02:45.633 --> 02:49.501
Spreading my wings,
the flag flapping in the breeze!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.803
<i>I did tricks with that</i>
<i>flag the likes of which</i>

02:51.805 --> 02:56.208
<i>No pony saw before,</i>
<i>and no pony's seen since!</i>

02:58.745 --> 03:02.414
Professionalism, ms. Dash,
I must insist.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.284
If you want to keep your job
as coach of these ponies,

03:05.286 --> 03:07.920
You must maintain a
professional attitude

03:07.922 --> 03:10.255
And keep your
emotions in check!

03:10.257 --> 03:14.560
Am I making myself absolutely,
100% crystal clear?

03:16.397 --> 03:20.465
You know, professionalism
is my middle name.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.868
Rainbow
"professionalism" dash.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.571
Hmph! Well, in
three days' time,

03:25.573 --> 03:31.243
Ms. Dash will accompany anypony
competing to the crystal empire

03:31.245 --> 03:33.512
Where you will demonstrate
your routines for me

03:33.514 --> 03:35.247
And the other judges.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.584
Who will judge you
very professionally.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.488
Ahem! Yes, quite,
quite correct!

03:43.490 --> 03:47.426
In the meantime, get
ready to train and train hard!

03:47.428 --> 03:50.729
Because I know this opening
ceremony is the single most

03:50.731 --> 03:54.499
<i>Important thing that will ever</i>
<i>happen in your young lives.</i>

03:54.501 --> 03:56.969
But I know you're up
for the challenge!

03:56.971 --> 03:58.503
And so am I!

03:58.505 --> 04:01.773
Wa-wahoooo-(cuts short)

04:01.775 --> 04:03.442
Ahem!

04:03.444 --> 04:06.545
Meet me after school tomorrow
at 15-hundred hours, sharp.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.248
And show me
your flag-carrying skills.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.549
I am outta here!

04:10.551 --> 04:12.384
<i>(skid)</i>

04:12.386 --> 04:13.585
Professionally!

04:13.587 --> 04:15.420
See how professionally?

04:15.422 --> 04:16.788
<i>(groan)</i>

04:16.790 --> 04:19.491
Ponies, the most
important thing is this:

04:19.493 --> 04:22.661
<i>Your routine needs to show</i>
<i>what your town means to you.</i>

04:22.663 --> 04:25.297
<i>So do ponyville proud!</i>

04:25.299 --> 04:28.500
Work hard. Be bold. Wow me.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.702
That is all.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.004
<i>(bell rings)</i>

04:32.006 --> 04:35.374
<i>(excited shouts)</i>

04:35.376 --> 04:37.576
So what do you say we come
up with the perfect routine

04:37.578 --> 04:38.710
And win this thing?

04:38.712 --> 04:40.979
I'd say that's rootin'
tootin' terrific!

04:40.981 --> 04:42.648
<i>But there's one problem!</i>

04:42.650 --> 04:45.917
I bet everypony in class
is planning to compete.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.988
Listen:  <u>Somepony</u> in our class
is gonna carry that flag.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.623
So it might as well be us!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.992
Crusaders, are you in,
or are you in?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.494
Cause I'm in.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.495
Me too!

04:57.564 --> 05:00.599
All right, the winning
routine needs to show

05:00.601 --> 05:02.634
What's important about
ponyville, right?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.835
Both: Right!

05:03.837 --> 05:06.672
So what's special
about ponyville?

05:06.674 --> 05:08.640
It's...It's...

05:11.979 --> 05:14.846
It's a place where
different kinds of ponies

05:14.848 --> 05:16.815
Live together as friends.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.650
Earth ponies, like me!

05:18.652 --> 05:20.519
Unicorns, like me!

05:20.521 --> 05:22.454
And pegasi, like me!

05:22.456 --> 05:25.624
So somehow we gotta figure out
a way to show that in our act.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.992
We're gonna
need a plan.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.860
And a lotta
hard work.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.896
And a whole bunch
of practice.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.932
But take it from me: We
may just be little ponies,

05:33.934 --> 05:37.569

strong as horses!

What does that have to
do with flag-carrying?

08:12.526 --> 08:15.193
Having cutie-mark-less
ponies represent ponyville

08:15.195 --> 08:17.262
Would be unthinkable!

08:17.264 --> 08:21.733

Keep working hard,
who knows?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.116
You might have a
shot. Gotta go.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.287
I'm not really sure.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.289
You heard her. If we
keep working hard,

10:24.291 --> 10:25.624
We might have a shot.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.691
So let's keep working!

10:26.693 --> 10:27.759
Trot to it, ponies!

10:30.329 --> 10:31.930
Did you see that?

10:31.932 --> 10:35.133
I can't believe I'm saying
this. They could win!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.668
But how do we stop them?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.970
We already called
them blank flanks.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.973
Then we need to find a new
way to get under their skin.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.017
Or maybe, get under their wings.

10:53.886 --> 10:57.989
Girls, we just wanted to say
your act is quite impressive!

10:57.991 --> 10:59.858
Wait, what?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.793
Um... Thanks?

11:01.795 --> 11:06.164
As a matter of fact,
we think you're very brave.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.333
Brave? Why?

11:08.335 --> 11:09.334
Isn't it obvious?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.368
It is to us.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.771
In fact, it's obvious
to everypony.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.440
You're showing all three
types of ponyville ponies,

11:15.442 --> 11:17.742
Yet you have a
pegasus pony...

11:17.744 --> 11:20.245

11:20.247 --> 11:22.981

have to do with anything?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.883
Silver spoon: I'd say
not being able to fly

11:24.885 --> 11:27.952

everything, doesn't it?

11:27.954 --> 11:31.089

pony at your age?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.792

flying long ago!

11:33.794 --> 11:36.394
So what if my wings
can't get me off the ground?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.029
Your career as a
flag carrier

11:38.031 --> 11:40.732

the ground, either.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.034

never pick a pegasus pony

said anything about that!

working how it is.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.795

my part in the whole thing.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.329
What?

12:11.331 --> 12:15.300
If we want to win, I'm
gonna have to fly.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.468
Is that even possible?

12:16.470 --> 12:18.169
And by tomorrow?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.305
Maybe I can fly if I
work twice as hard.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.740

12:21.742 --> 12:22.907

this for sure:
