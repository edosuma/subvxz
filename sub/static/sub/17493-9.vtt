00:02.000 --> 00:04.120
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:04.120 --> 00:05.560
Sarah and Duck.

00:05.560 --> 00:07.440
QUACK!

00:07.440 --> 00:08.960
Sarah and Duck.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.240
QUACK!

00:11.240 --> 00:13.040
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

00:15.800 --> 00:20.560
It's a sunny day and Sarah and Duck have just visited Cloud Captain

00:20.560 --> 00:24.320
and now they're off for a walk in the park.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.240
Do-bee-do-bee-do-da. Clickety-click.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.600
- QUACK!
- Oh!

00:28.600 --> 00:31.080
Do-bee-do-bee-do. Clickety-click.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.720
- Well, she seems in a good mood.
- Hmm.
- QUACK, QUACK.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.640
Come on, Duck.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.160
QUACK.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.000
- Hello, Scarf Lady.
- Oh, hello, you two.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.280
Come to give me a hand?

00:43.280 --> 00:44.520
Hmm...no.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.680
- Oh, good.
- She clearly said no!

00:47.680 --> 00:50.960
- What's all this about?
- Twang ball.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.600
QUACK! QUACK!

00:52.600 --> 00:54.320
It's a game I used to play.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.960
I just need to finish making all the bits.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.040
Ah, that does sound fun.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.400
What are the rules?

01:00.400 --> 01:03.720
No rules! You just make those up as you go along.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.760
- That's what makes it so fun!
- And confusing.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.240
Finished!

01:09.240 --> 01:11.720
Right, then, one, two...

01:11.720 --> 01:15.080
Oh, dear, we're a bit short on players.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.720
There's plenty of folk in the park today.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.400
Uh-huh, we'll find folk.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.080
- QUACK!
- Not you, Duck!

01:24.080 --> 01:26.400
I need your help setting up.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.360
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK?

01:29.360 --> 01:31.360
QUACK, QUACK.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.920
- Oh!
- I think we've found our first player.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.760
- Hello.
- Oh!
- Want to play twang ball?

01:41.760 --> 01:44.400
Erm, how do you play it?

01:44.400 --> 01:48.480
Hmm... Don't know.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.360
There aren't any rules.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.000
That's what makes it such...fun.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Erm, no, thanks.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.280
Ice cream.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.760
Oh, OK.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.960
Bye!

02:02.960 --> 02:05.880
Seems it's not that easy to convince people

02:05.880 --> 02:07.920
to play a game with no rules.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.480
Mm-hm!

02:09.480 --> 02:12.680
If we just knew one or two of them.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.320
Huh! We can make them up!

02:15.320 --> 02:18.120
- Rules they'd like.
- Good thinking!

02:20.680 --> 02:24.720
- What are you doing?
- Going to play twang ball.

02:24.720 --> 02:28.120
You can ask lots of questions, it's in the rules.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.160
Can I play?

02:30.160 --> 02:32.280
Hmm... OK.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.760
Want to play twang ball?

02:36.760 --> 02:38.920
- There's...
- Dancing!

02:38.920 --> 02:41.240
Lots of lots of dancing.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.680
- Really?
- Uh-huh, it's in the rules now.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.840
We have to play.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.840
- Whoa!
- Caw!

02:50.120 --> 02:52.160
- Want to play now?
- Huh?

02:52.160 --> 02:55.560
Rule number one is safety.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.080
- Erm...
- Come on!

02:59.480 --> 03:01.560
Caw!

03:04.320 --> 03:08.840
Right, then, the game kicks off with the twanga - me,

03:08.840 --> 03:11.640
twanging a wool ball into the air with this.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.400
You have to catch the ball in your hat.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.200
Whooo! Boompf!

03:18.200 --> 03:21.200
And whoever catches it has to perform a task.

03:21.200 --> 03:24.360
John, make a noise like Flamingo.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.480
Eh...

03:26.480 --> 03:29.160
- Huh?
- Caw!

03:29.160 --> 03:30.800
That's twang ball!

03:30.800 --> 03:34.480
Because you did it, you can put the wool ball into your team's

03:34.480 --> 03:38.480
basket and the winners are the team with the most balls at the end.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.080
And Bag here will be our task judge.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.720
Oh, dear.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.480
Let's get this game stared!

03:49.200 --> 03:51.840
- Caw!
- Oh!

03:51.840 --> 03:53.360
Ahh!

03:53.360 --> 03:56.040
Huh! I did it!

03:56.040 --> 03:58.520
- Oh!
- Agh!
- Erm...

03:58.520 --> 04:00.160
Oh, do a dance.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.400
- Erm...
- Caw!
- OK.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.520
- Caw!
- Oh!

04:11.520 --> 04:13.600
Not bad, not bad. That's...

04:14.640 --> 04:16.520
..twang ball.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.400
- Yes!
- Caw.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.600
- A strong start for the yellow team.
- QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

04:31.640 --> 04:33.040
Yes!

04:33.040 --> 04:34.560
QUACK!

04:34.560 --> 04:36.280
Caw!

04:37.880 --> 04:39.800
Caw!

04:41.520 --> 04:42.960
Easy!

04:44.880 --> 04:46.680
Whoa! Whoa...!

04:49.520 --> 04:51.400
Not a twang ball.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.160
QUACK!

04:58.280 --> 04:59.720
QUACK!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.680
Hmmm.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.040
Don't eat this bread.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.640
QUACK, QUACK!

05:05.640 --> 05:08.480
- QUACK!
- Not a twang ball.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.480
Oh!

05:10.480 --> 05:12.360
Huh...! Oh!

05:12.360 --> 05:13.480
Yes!

05:13.480 --> 05:14.960
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

05:14.960 --> 05:18.640
- Make a new noise.
- Hmm...

05:20.080 --> 05:23.120
Smaableeck!!

05:23.120 --> 05:25.880
- Whoa!
- Good noise.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.280
Caw!

05:33.680 --> 05:36.000
Count all the grass in the park.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.280
Caw!

05:40.280 --> 05:42.200
- Correct!
- What?

05:42.200 --> 05:43.800
Aggh!

05:43.800 --> 05:47.360
Spin round and round then run in a straight line.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.280
Oh...

05:51.280 --> 05:52.960
Whoa.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.760
Aggh.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.120
Yep, twang ball.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.000
- Whoa!
- Oh!

05:59.000 --> 06:00.960
Oh, good catch!

06:00.960 --> 06:03.560
- Sing us a song.
- No.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.400
Foul.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.720
Eh! What do you think you're doing?

06:07.720 --> 06:10.800
- You need a time out.
- I'm the umpire!

06:10.800 --> 06:12.680
Oh, last ball.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.160
It's all down to this last twang ball.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.240
Hello.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.120
- Oooh!
- Sorry!

06:19.120 --> 06:20.920
Oh, no.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.360
GLASS SMASHES

06:26.360 --> 06:29.640
I don't think we're getting our ball back.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.440
Oh, well. I suppose that's that.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.160
- Who's won?
- I have no idea.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.640
From the look of those baskets, I'd say it's a draw.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.760
- Whoo!
- Yes!

06:39.760 --> 06:41.400
QUACK! QUACK! QUACK!

06:41.400 --> 06:43.760
I love twang ball.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.320
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:48.960 --> 06:51.400
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:52.600 --> 06:55.360
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!

06:55.360 --> 06:58.080
- Sarah and Duck.
- QUACK!
