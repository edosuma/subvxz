WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.091
My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.658
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.139
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.228
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.795
And by the time I got here,

00:12.838 --> 00:17.321
my cousin had already grown up and become... Superman.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.845
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:19.889 --> 00:23.501
when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.545 --> 00:27.070
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.114 --> 00:30.160
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister
at the DEO

00:30.204 --> 00:32.423
to protect this planet
I call my home

00:32.467 --> 00:35.165
from anyone that means
to cause it harm.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.125
I am Supergirl.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.258
Previously onSupergirl...

00:41.302 --> 00:42.477
Thank you
for standing by my side

00:42.520 --> 00:44.653
and letting me
handle this by myself.

00:44.696 --> 00:45.958
And your other investigation?

00:46.002 --> 00:47.090
Guardian who?

00:47.134 --> 00:48.526
-I love you, Manchester.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.181
Fiona.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.709
Fiona was looking into him.
And I tried to follow up.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.233
Officer Petrocelli?

01:00.321 --> 01:01.626
This is the haranel.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.324
There's so many things
we don't know about it.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.153
Its uses, its powers,
its dangers.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.459
We're ready to begin
phase two of our trials.

01:08.503 --> 01:11.810
I'm sorry,
but Thanksgiving for me
is all about pumpkin.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.029
-Yes.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.293
Apple is way better
and more American.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.991
But the nutmeg,
the ginger,

01:19.035 --> 01:20.993
and the dollop
of fresh whipped cream.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.648
Okay, I love it
when you say "dollop."

01:29.263 --> 01:30.394
Come on, let's go.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.179
This used to be
a nice neighborhood.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.660
Until you infested it.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.315
Nice is overrated.

01:38.359 --> 01:39.534
Let's go. Let's go.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.275
-Go get those scum!

01:54.723 --> 01:56.333
Petrocelli.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.901
Hey, friend-o.
Remember me?

02:09.216 --> 02:11.740
That's weird.
Dogs usually love me.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.959
I'm outta here, man.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.570
Take a step
and I break his neck.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.193
Thanks, but I had it
under control.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.673
Manchester, right?

02:32.761 --> 02:34.110
We... We've met.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.242
Yeah, I remember.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.374
So, what are you doing here?

02:37.418 --> 02:41.378
You know, just out for a walk
and I saw this lot harassing
a nice alien couple.

02:41.422 --> 02:42.466
Huh.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.306
"To all true Children
of Liberty

02:56.350 --> 02:59.396
who believe
this country is ours.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.269
We must resist
the alien scourge."

03:04.140 --> 03:05.707
This is a manifesto.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.323
Who is this Agent Liberty?

03:13.889 --> 03:15.282
We all are.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.738
Sorry I'm late.

03:36.781 --> 03:39.044
My car was wet
and these leaflets stuck
to it like paper mache.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.438
It's okay. I was just about
to check the efficiency

03:41.482 --> 03:43.701
of the haranel treatment
on the tumors.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.877
They call themselves
the Children of Liberty.

03:45.921 --> 03:49.272
I think these are the ones
who kept calling Guardian
a human hero.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.491
So creepy.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.580
I'm hoping James
will denounce them today.

03:52.623 --> 03:55.844
I booked him on Sean Chiu's
television program,
The Counterpoint Daily.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.280
You did?
I love that show.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.372
Okay, we gotta
get the rhythm back.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.809
BPM is 194 and rising.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.550
Charge.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.817
The tumors
were still growing.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.431
Take a biopsy,
we'll destroy the sample.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.351
We still have
two protocols left.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.702
You're trying to cure cancer,
it's gonna take time.

04:42.064 --> 04:45.154
The Children of Liberty
announcing themselves
to the world.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.939
Agent Dox is already
working on identifying
Agent Liberty,

04:47.983 --> 04:50.377
and trying to find
if there's a deeper
message in the manifesto.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.858
Why? I mean,
these are the rantings
of a human hate group.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.120
The FBI will deal with it.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.731
But this
could be dangerous.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.167
There's precedent.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.995
From the White Rose
in Germany

05:00.038 --> 05:02.302
to the CIA
in Guatemala in 1954.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.522
Leaflets like this,
they were used
to activate uprisings.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.481
It's not our purview,
Director.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.309
And speaking of purview,

05:09.352 --> 05:10.832
where were you
when you found this?

05:10.875 --> 05:14.531
I was stopping an attack
on two aliens
by men in masks.

05:14.575 --> 05:15.576
But where?

05:15.619 --> 05:16.620
Midtown Park.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.840
Were you ordered
to patrol there?

05:18.883 --> 05:19.797
I went because I heard--

05:19.841 --> 05:21.625
Were you ordered
to patrol there?

05:23.192 --> 05:25.063
No, ma'am.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.414
I know you've had free rein
in the past, but things
are different now.

05:27.457 --> 05:30.547
If you want to intervene
in muggings, join the NCPD.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.157
This is the DEO.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.856
We swim in deeper waters.

05:34.899 --> 05:39.121
Our resources will not be used
to investigate this manifesto.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.776
You tell Agent Dox
to return to his other
assignments, is that clear?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.127
Yes, ma'am.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.869
I may not be
the Woman of Steel,
but if you push me

05:48.565 --> 05:50.567
you will find I do not bend.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.005
Dismissed.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.881
And one more thing.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.579
I brought some
sweet potato pie today.
It's in the cafeteria.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.713
Happy Thanksgiving.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.502
She's completely
dug her heels in here.

06:12.546 --> 06:13.721
She has all of the power.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.505
So we're just
gonna listen to her?

06:15.549 --> 06:16.854
What? No way.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.682
-No, we're still
investigating this.
-Yeah.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.684
And if she gets any more
Dolores Umbridge-y,

06:20.728 --> 06:22.382
I'm going full
Weasley twin.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.819
Yeah, and who
would eat that pie?
It's for sure poisoned.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.124
Absolutely.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.865
Mmm.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.651
I've located the drones
that dropped the manifesto.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.479
Unfortunately,
they're untraceable.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.437
No prints,
no serial numbers.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.613
Brainy, I'm sorry to say
that Colonel Haley

06:36.657 --> 06:40.008
has officially ordered you
to stop the investigation.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.183
Okay.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.445
What? No, no, no.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.099
You understand
what I'm saying, right?

06:44.142 --> 06:46.884
I assure you
our communication difficulties
are in the past.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.496
Consider my investigation
terminated.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.671
No, no, Brainy,

06:50.714 --> 06:53.630
we want you to keep
looking into it.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.241
Okay, I'm confused.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.679
It's... It's why I winked.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.160
Ah, yes.

07:02.204 --> 07:05.816
I shall continue
my investigation
in  complete secrecy.

07:08.906 --> 07:09.994
For you.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.695
-I don't...

07:15.783 --> 07:19.003
I swear that
he's going to get me fired
by the end of the day.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.050
Oh, by the way,
Eliza texted.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.748
You're on cranberry sauce for
Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.577
When am I supposed to
go to the grocery store?

07:29.623 --> 07:32.669
Why were the Children
of Liberty out there
patrolling in the first place?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.454
Petrocelli could blow
this whole thing.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.282
Just make sure
they all lay low

07:38.153 --> 07:39.546
until the time comes.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.601
Sorry it took so long.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.081
It was a zoo
but I got everything.

07:53.124 --> 07:56.084
I got the sweet potatoes,
I got the rolls, and I...

07:56.127 --> 07:57.564
...think I got the allspice.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.522
My hero.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.611
Well, I have some good news.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.135
It looks like we're gonna
be able to make our mortgage
payment again this month.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.748
Oh, well, when you sign up
for "richer or for poorer"

08:07.791 --> 08:10.664
you kinda hope it's not
always for poorer.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.449
Is it "for poorer"?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.190
Isn't it just "for poor"?

08:15.233 --> 08:17.148
You know, I don't remember.
I wasn't actually
paying attention.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.544
Mom, Dad,
you gotta see this!

08:24.112 --> 08:25.766
Look.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.072
Most were surprised by this Children of Liberty manifesto.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.684
However,
former history professor,
Ben Lockwood,

08:30.727 --> 08:33.208
had a little more foresight.
Take a look.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.557
Did you know about this?

08:34.601 --> 08:35.993
Throughout history,
the downtrodden

08:36.037 --> 08:38.126
have found ways
to make their voices heard

08:38.169 --> 08:40.302
before the mainstream
forgets about them.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.565
But the irony in this case

08:42.609 --> 08:45.263
is that the mainstream,
humanity,

08:45.307 --> 08:47.265
are the downtrodden.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.267
Dad, you're famous.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.834
That was
Professor Ben Lockwood
commenting on

08:50.878 --> 08:53.533
the current state of
human-alien relations...

08:53.576 --> 08:55.230
I'll be there.
Thank you.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.495
Am I interrupting,
Mr. Olsen?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.062
Always got time for you.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.282
Uh, what's in the bag?

09:04.326 --> 09:05.632
Why don't you take a look?

09:12.116 --> 09:13.683
Wow.

09:13.727 --> 09:14.989
Thank you.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.519
You spoil me.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.781
Yeah.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.219
Oh, yeah.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.700
And, you know,
you might have
the opportunity to wear it,

09:30.744 --> 09:32.136
maybe in the next
couple of hours.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.703
What do you mean?

09:33.747 --> 09:35.662
I booked you to go on
Counterpoint Dailytoday.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.623
I think you should
go on TV and disavow
the Children of Liberty.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.494
I know you moved
away from that idea,

09:42.538 --> 09:44.148
but things have
escalated, okay?

09:44.192 --> 09:46.411
Their manifesto was filled
with hate speech.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.284
Yeah, I just wish
that you would have
checked with me first.

09:49.327 --> 09:50.807
I can't do that today.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.767
Well, why not?

09:53.810 --> 09:57.466
Well, after the Mayor's event,
I reached out to Ben Lockwood.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.076
And it took some time,

09:59.120 --> 10:02.689
but I got connected
with some actual
Children of Liberty.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.691
I'm meeting
with them today.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.563
You're meeting with
a domestic terror group?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.304
To learn who they are.

10:09.347 --> 10:13.656
And eventually,
get an interview with
Agent Liberty himself.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.832
You said it yourself,
these people admire me,

10:15.876 --> 10:17.704
and maybe I can use that
to change minds.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.663
I said that before they
dropped their hateful
agenda on the world.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.752
All the more reason
to go now, isn't it?

10:22.796 --> 10:24.928
It's all the more reason
to think they might
resort to violence,

10:24.972 --> 10:27.583
especially if they've
got their human posterboy
in their midst.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.063
Human posterboy?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.329
You don't think
I can do this, do you?

10:36.157 --> 10:37.811
-I don't know.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.116
Where are you meeting them?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.770
They're gonna call me
15 minutes beforehand.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.338
So it's
an undisclosed location
with unknown context.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.601
This is how journalists
end up dead, James.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.777
Most journalists are not me.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.870
So it doesn't matter
what I think.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.480
Not about this.
This is work.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.309
Oh. "This is work."

10:58.353 --> 11:01.399
Well, then your boss
has booked a major
television appearance for you.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.359
So figure it out.

11:15.936 --> 11:16.980
Hey.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.721
-My favorite Martian.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.680
Sorry, you probably
get that all the time.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.377
You didn't reply
to my invitation.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.466
Right. Uh, yeah,
Pilgrim Day.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.643
I'm just not up for it, man.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.471
Right. It's just that
I was worried that

11:29.514 --> 11:32.430
those leaflets might
stir up some bad
feelings for you.

11:32.474 --> 11:33.997
-Nothing I can't handle.
-Right.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.956
Well, maybe
a turkey dinner will help.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.827
It's a small gathering,
we'd love to have you.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.351
Although I can't promise
there won't be Charades.

11:40.395 --> 11:41.918
As much as I love Charades...

11:43.703 --> 11:45.574
I understand, I understand.

11:45.617 --> 11:47.924
Well, look, man,
if you change your mind
here's my friend's address.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.845
J'onn.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.891
Thanks for thinking of me.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.023
Sure.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.340
Right.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.950
Where were we?

12:13.994 --> 12:16.561
Oh, yeah, you were
about to start talking.

12:28.399 --> 12:31.968
Oh, James,
I have 800 words
on the assault last night

12:32.012 --> 12:34.841
by the men
wearing Agent Liberty masks.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.190
Yeah.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.280
-Yeah.

12:39.323 --> 12:42.326
Uh, Lena booked me
on this round table thing.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.371
That's great!

12:44.720 --> 12:45.895
Isn't... Isn't that great?

12:45.939 --> 12:48.593
Um, she should've
told me first. You know?

12:48.637 --> 12:52.075
Okay, so I made plans
to meet with somebody
from Children of Liberty,

12:52.119 --> 12:55.383
and now she wants me
to go on a TV show
and denounce them.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.560
Well, she's worried
about your image
as Guardian.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.692
I know Lena
can be forceful,

13:00.736 --> 13:02.825
but she protects
the ones she loves.

13:02.869 --> 13:03.913
She's not always right.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.394
She's right most of the time.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.091
Whose side are you on?

13:08.135 --> 13:10.877
I'm on both of your sides.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.617
But I'm still not doing
the round table.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.620
-I can do it.
-No. No, no, no.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.449
It's only in a few hours
and there's lot of preparation
that needs to be done.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.843
And half the newsroom
is gone because of
the holiday.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.540
I mean... No.

13:22.584 --> 13:25.239
That's fine.
I'll just ask Nia to help me.
Where's...

13:26.893 --> 13:28.720
You, you mean Nia Nal,

13:28.764 --> 13:31.288
the one who's literally
asleep on the job?

13:31.332 --> 13:32.986
No, she's not...

13:35.118 --> 13:36.337
-Oh.

13:41.385 --> 13:44.301
Chocolate-covered
espresso beans.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.260
-Nia.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.045
You feeling all right?

13:49.089 --> 13:51.482
Oh. Oh, no.
Please don't fire me.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.049
No, no, no, no.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.398
No one's gonna fire you.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.922
You do amazing work

13:55.965 --> 13:58.054
when you're...awake.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.752
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything before,

14:00.796 --> 14:03.277
but I have that sleep thing.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.847
The one that
causes you to fall asleep
at random times.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.588
-Yes!

14:10.632 --> 14:11.894
That's it, narcolepsy.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.855
Oh. Well, Nia,
that's a serious illness.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.030
Have you seen a doctor?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.032
Yeah, yeah, back in DC.

14:19.815 --> 14:20.990
I haven't found
anyone here yet.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.774
Well, if there's
anything we can do...

14:22.818 --> 14:25.821
Yeah, don't hesitate
to ask for help.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.909
Yeah.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.606
Thanks.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.652
Uh, let me get you
that information on
Children of Liberty.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.266
Hey, have you found anything?

14:37.224 --> 14:39.922
Nothing on the identity
of Agent Liberty.

14:39.966 --> 14:44.796
However, I was able to find
10,011 codes
within the leaflet.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.582
It is literally
littered with codes.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.367
For example,
if you scramble
every seventh letter,

14:50.411 --> 14:53.414
it clearly indicates
a common phrase
in the Raolian language.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.026
"Ham sandwich."

14:57.070 --> 15:00.029
On a holiday celebrated
exclusively with turkey,

15:00.073 --> 15:02.118
that is just
a slap in the face.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.729
And that is
the most promising code?

15:04.773 --> 15:06.253
Agents,

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
a briefing on
your current work, please.

15:09.821 --> 15:10.866
Um...

15:10.910 --> 15:12.346
Oh, no.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.479
Uh, you caught me, Colonel.

15:15.523 --> 15:16.959
I must confess,

15:17.003 --> 15:19.266
your sweet potato pie
is so delicious

15:19.309 --> 15:23.487
that it inspired me
to search for a recipe
and make one of my very own.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.402
For Thanksgiving.

15:25.446 --> 15:29.189
I apologize for allowing
your masterful baking
to distract me

15:29.232 --> 15:32.453
from important DEO business.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.324
Back to work, Agent Dox.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.717
Director Danvers.

15:36.413 --> 15:37.545
Yes, ma'am.

15:43.116 --> 15:47.816
You see, Alex,
some human behaviors require
experiential learning.

15:47.859 --> 15:51.472
Now I can add
"covering on the spot"
to my skills of mastery.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.691
Yes, well, that was
a little too close.

15:53.735 --> 15:56.042
So just keep a low profile

15:56.085 --> 15:57.869
and let me know
if you find anything.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.523
-Mmm.
-Good, good job.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.003
Yes.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.745
-I'll keep a low profile.
To yourself, please.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.194
James Olsen?

16:18.760 --> 16:19.761
In the flesh.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.024
Wow.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.723
You're a lot bigger
in person.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.464
Tell me,
what do you bench?

16:27.508 --> 16:28.726
Normally, drug dealers.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.990
You're funny, too.

16:31.033 --> 16:35.385
Oh, man. I mean...
I'm sorry, it's just
such an honor to meet you.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.040
Your work as Guardian
has inspired so many of us

16:38.084 --> 16:39.868
to stand up and fight
for justice.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.696
Thanks, man.

16:41.739 --> 16:44.090
-Oh, yeah...

16:44.133 --> 16:47.049
Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous. Tom.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.442
Tom, nice to
meet you, brother.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.704
Me too.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.097
You, uh,
you ready to go?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.533
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.145
Do you wanna
throw that in the back?

16:56.189 --> 16:57.755
-Yeah, sure.
-Cool.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.459
You're not afraid
of dogs, are you?

17:09.854 --> 17:11.204
The hearts keep dying.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.771
We shocked it three times
but it wouldn't revive.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.425
Did you measure the tumor?

17:15.947 --> 17:17.340
3.6 millimeters.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.516
The tumors are growing.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.302
The He radiation should be
shrinking them completely.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.043
Why don't we stay
and adjust the protocol?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.262
No. No, you go home
to your family.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.048
I don't really like them
that much anyway.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.919
No, we can figure this out.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.269
No. We're not gonna
come up with any solutions
staying here today.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.881
Incinerate it.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.198
The heart didn't burn up.
Why didn't it burn up?

17:49.938 --> 17:51.505
That's impossible.
Try again.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.640
-It must have.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.730
It made the heart invincible.

18:01.297 --> 18:02.690
As a reporter for CatCo,

18:02.733 --> 18:06.128
what role do you think
the media should be playing

18:06.172 --> 18:08.478
in the rising
anti

18:08.522 --> 18:12.743
The goal of the media
is to ensure that
every voice is heard.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.310
Ignorance breeds fear.

18:14.354 --> 18:18.140
So the more factual,
dynamic news stories
we write,

18:18.184 --> 18:20.490
including about aliens,
the less we will...

18:23.319 --> 18:24.581
-Nia!
-I'm listening.

18:24.625 --> 18:28.759
Nia, we have got to
get you help.

18:28.803 --> 18:32.807
Hey, you know,
you should come to my place
on Thanksgiving.

18:32.850 --> 18:36.332
My mom will be there,
and she knows all the top
doctors in the city.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.420
She can help you.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.988
-No, I don't--

18:40.031 --> 18:41.207
We're ready for you,
Miss Danvers.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.078
Uh, got it. Yup.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.210
Thank you.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.649
Okay, wait, wait.

18:48.692 --> 18:49.911
I'm good at this.

18:53.088 --> 18:54.263
You're gonna do great.

18:54.307 --> 18:57.223
You are passionate,
you're intelligent.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.357
Your hair looks amazing.
Did you get highlights?

19:01.401 --> 19:03.359
-Yeah.
-Go get 'em.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.883
I thought I was the mentor.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.498
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.282
Kara Danvers,
thank you so much
for joining us on the show.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.283
Thanks for having me.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.067
And this is
your counterpoint.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.895
Hi. Ben Lockwood.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.941
It's very nice to meet you.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.303
Everything okay?

19:34.347 --> 19:36.305
Yeah, it's just my wife.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.612
Last minute grocery list
keeps on growing.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.919
So when do I get
to meet Agent Liberty?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.313
You're talking to him.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.097
You're Agent Liberty?

19:46.141 --> 19:47.490
Well, we're all
Agents of Liberty.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.189
Nah.
I mean the big guy.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.495
Guy who signed the leaflet.
I was hoping to get
to interview him.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.367
Well, that's above
my pay grade.

19:54.410 --> 19:58.240
I was just asked
to show you what we do
and answer some questions.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.763
And this is what you do?

19:59.807 --> 20:02.331
We patrol the streets,
keep them safe for humans,

20:02.375 --> 20:04.464
just like you do
with Guardian.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.031
This week is special.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.121
We don't want any roaches
crashing people's
Thanksgiving dinners.

20:10.165 --> 20:12.036
"Roaches"?

20:12.080 --> 20:13.951
That's pretty heavy language,
and I would really
appreciate it

20:13.995 --> 20:16.911
if you didn't
call aliens "roaches"
in my presence.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.782
But that's what they are.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.610
Or do you just classify them
that way so you don't
have to deal with

20:20.654 --> 20:22.656
the fact that they're
living, breathing beings
just like you and I?

20:22.699 --> 20:26.399
That's funny 'cause I've seen
you decimate quite a few
of them yourself as Guardian.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.445
And I also fight against
humans that break the law.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.235
-Yeah, I better
give her a call.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.627
Do you mind
holding onto that?

20:37.671 --> 20:38.672
Thanks.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.506
"Children of Liberty."

20:46.549 --> 20:49.248
Well, that's a stupid
name, innit?

20:49.291 --> 20:52.425
What's with the mask?
Too cowardly to show
your face, eh?

20:55.558 --> 20:57.212
Weird lenses.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.910
Right, I'm gonna
ask you once more.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.962
Who is Agent Liberty
and where can I find him?

21:08.005 --> 21:09.920
Don't give me a reason
to have to use these.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.182
Please, it's like I said.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.706
I just got the mask.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.925
I'm supposed
to patrol the street
and scare roaches.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.405
That is all I know.

21:19.539 --> 21:22.063
Well, I tried to
save you some suffering.

21:23.543 --> 21:26.763
It seems like some blokes
are just masochists.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.679
If only I could see
into this big,

21:29.723 --> 21:31.464
ugly head of yours.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.553
Actually...

21:36.556 --> 21:37.818
Maybe I can.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.481
Most aliens want
to live peacefully
just like humans do.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.570
Okay, and where's
the proof in that?

21:50.613 --> 21:52.441
Because there have been
numerous alien attacks,
human lives have been lost.

21:52.485 --> 21:56.140
But there are also aliens
making extraordinary
contributions.

21:56.184 --> 22:00.188
Every one that I interviewed
for my Aliens in National City
series was exceptional.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.583
Okay, but for a second,
let's just talk about
human exceptionalism.

22:03.626 --> 22:06.455
For example, your own
editor in chief, James Olsen.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.891
He was supposed to be
here tonight, was he not?

22:07.935 --> 22:09.719
Uh, yes.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.505
Okay, so Guardian,
if the Children of Liberty
are such a problem,

22:12.548 --> 22:14.942
why hasn't Guardian
renounced them?

22:14.985 --> 22:17.553
In fact, rumor is
he's meeting with
them right now,

22:17.597 --> 22:19.903
which seems to indicate
that James Olsen understands

22:19.947 --> 22:21.862
that these people have
something of value to say.

22:21.905 --> 22:25.344
There is a very clear
difference between
having something to say

22:25.387 --> 22:26.997
and the hate speech
in these leaflets.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.565
This manifesto will only
incite violence and fear,

22:29.609 --> 22:31.306
and as Americans,
we are better than that.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.482
On Thanksgiving,
tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.528
It is a day for family,
for our community.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.791
It is about welcoming
different cultures

22:37.834 --> 22:40.402
and celebrating
a gratitude for life together.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.100
That is what liberty is about.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.454
Maybe that's a good place
to end this conver--

22:48.497 --> 22:49.672
That's a really good point.
I'm sorry, I just need
to respond to that.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.674
I think it's very interesting

22:51.718 --> 22:54.329
that we are here,
having this debate

22:54.373 --> 22:56.418
the day before
Thanksgiving Day.

22:56.462 --> 23:00.030
I mean, American history,
it has this nasty habit with
this holiday particularly

23:00.074 --> 23:03.077
to just wrap it all up
in a neat little bow,

23:03.120 --> 23:07.255
when the truth is
in the years following the
indigenous Wampanoag people

23:07.298 --> 23:10.693
inviting the pilgrims
to a wonderful
Thanksgiving meal,

23:10.737 --> 23:13.653
the European invaders
slaughtered their hosts.

23:13.696 --> 23:17.091
So if we do not learn
from American history.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.441
Is it possible

23:19.485 --> 23:24.315
that 100 years from now,
the aliens will have their own
wonderful, thankful holiday

23:24.359 --> 23:26.622
about how they slaughtered us?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.798
-I--
Yeah! That's right.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.680
You didn't think about
using real cranberries?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.551
Well, like that's
any better than this.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.727
Well, it does look
easier to digest.

23:44.771 --> 23:48.252
I'm still feeling queasy
from hearing the audience
cheer for Lockwood.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.689
Look, don't beat
yourself up, okay?

23:49.732 --> 23:51.647
Yeah, that wasn't even
supposed to be you up there.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.214
I can get it.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.261
Oh. Well, if it isn't
my stalker.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.569
Nia Nal. I didn't realize
you were going to be here.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.658
So those flowers
aren't for me?

24:02.702 --> 24:04.530
Uh, no, they're for Kara.

24:04.573 --> 24:07.576
I was once told
to always show up
not empty-handed.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.186
Sounds like your mother
raised you right.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.711
No, she most definitely
did not.

24:11.754 --> 24:13.495
Brainy, I'm so glad
you made it.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.236
These are lovely.

24:16.324 --> 24:17.847
-They're not real.
-Oh.

24:19.109 --> 24:21.372
Hi. Is J'onn here?

24:21.416 --> 24:23.462
-Yeah.
-I'm Manchester.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.247
Oh, hi. I'm Kara,
it's very nice to meet you.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.857
I've heard so much about you.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.731
I am sorry for your loss.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.125
-Thank you.
-Oh.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.214
Thanks.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.521
-You made it.
-Yeah, got hungry.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.696
Oh, we can take care of that.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.786
I am Eliza,
Kara and Alex's mom.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.440
-Mmm-hmm.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.791
Yeah, she's quite
a inch, isn't she?

24:49.618 --> 24:50.924
Thank you?

24:51.577 --> 24:53.404
Oh, let me give you a hand.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.754
Thanks, Nia.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.020
Saw Supergirl the other night.

25:00.063 --> 25:03.023
Yeah, she mentioned that.
Said you were quite helpful.

25:03.066 --> 25:04.677
I hope you don't mind,

25:04.720 --> 25:07.418
but Kara told me
about your narcolepsy.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.638
Oh, it's really not
that big of a deal.

25:09.682 --> 25:13.337
My friend, Dr. Moger
is a specialist
in sleep disorders

25:13.381 --> 25:14.730
right here in National City.

25:14.774 --> 25:17.733
Oh, my gosh, what an
unexpected coincidence.

25:17.777 --> 25:20.562
I've already texted her,
she can get you in
any time next week.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.391
No! No, thank you, um...

25:23.434 --> 25:25.524
I already have
a doctor here.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.831
Oh. Who?
Maybe I know them?

25:28.875 --> 25:31.051
Uh, Dr. Smith.

25:31.573 --> 25:32.574
Gene Smith?

25:32.618 --> 25:35.708
No, um...
Uh, Minsky?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.579
Dr. Minsky Smith.

25:37.623 --> 25:40.451
He's really young,
I'm sure you don't know him.

25:40.495 --> 25:43.324
Not that you don't
know young people.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.760
It's okay.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.633
I'm gonna go
get some napkins.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.592
So you would never use
your powers against someone?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.463
Not even to stop
more violence?

25:52.507 --> 25:53.769
Well, in defense I might.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.163
[pop music playing
on speakers]

25:56.206 --> 25:57.860
What about mind reading?

25:59.253 --> 26:00.602
That's not violence.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.039
It's a type of violence
if done without consent.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.998
Prying in to
someone's personal thoughts.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.131
Why do you ask?

26:08.175 --> 26:10.351
Just thinking about Fi.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.831
I'm wondering
what she would do

26:11.874 --> 26:13.659
if she were here to see
how bad things are getting.

26:16.705 --> 26:17.706
Hey.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.056
You made it.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.971
Um, of course.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.843
I just thought you'd be
sitting down to dinner
with your new friends.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.676
-Yeah.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.242
Did you still
go meet with them?

26:32.852 --> 26:33.940
Yeah.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.118
Well, there you go.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.773
How did things go
with your Children
of Liberty contact?

26:40.816 --> 26:42.731
Doesn't seem
very safe, James.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.646
I happened to meet with
a regular guy named Tom

26:44.690 --> 26:47.649
who happens to be afraid
of aliens, and afraid
of their capabilities,

26:47.693 --> 26:49.172
and he feels inferior.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.913
People can be powerful, too.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.915
You and Alex are examples
of that, James.

26:52.959 --> 26:55.048
Yeah, but not
as powerful as aliens.

26:55.091 --> 26:57.790
I mean, no matter how many
weights you lift you'll never
be as strong as Supergirl.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.793
No, but with technology
we can hold our own.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.533
What if we
could do more?

27:02.577 --> 27:04.405
What if we could
make people super?

27:04.448 --> 27:05.754
It's not possible.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.365
The biological processes
that cause alien powers

27:08.409 --> 27:10.541
are incompatible
with human DNA.

27:10.585 --> 27:11.891
Okay, but just say
we could, right?

27:11.934 --> 27:14.110
If James is right
and people feeling inferior

27:14.154 --> 27:16.635
is what makes them join
these hate groups,
then we could just

27:17.461 --> 27:18.767
level the playing field.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.726
The last thing we need
is a bunch of evil people

27:20.769 --> 27:22.118
running around
with super powers.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.686
Okay, but evil people
wouldn't get powers.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.775
So only certain
people qualify?

27:26.819 --> 27:28.734
And who would decide
who gets them?

27:29.473 --> 27:30.736
They'd be playing God.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.914
Let's eat!

27:34.957 --> 27:36.567
Hey, I saw you
on Counterpoint Daily.

27:36.611 --> 27:39.832
I'm really sorry
to put you out there
like that last minute.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.966
I just worry
that this manifesto

27:44.010 --> 27:46.752
really is a harbinger
of something terrible.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.362
In the text, we found
numerous hidden messages,

27:48.405 --> 27:51.278
but even the most
threatening was
about charcuterie.

27:53.193 --> 27:57.806
It seems scarier
now that they've trained dogs
to identify aliens.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.460
-Yup.

27:59.503 --> 28:02.202
Actually, the guy
Supergirl fought the other
night had a dog.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.900
What are you thinking, James?

28:04.944 --> 28:06.728
Tom and I were
walking his dog yesterday

28:06.772 --> 28:09.035
and the dog kept barking
at certain houses.

28:09.644 --> 28:10.732
Alien houses.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.255
Did they mark them somehow?

28:12.299 --> 28:14.518
He kept texting somebody,
who he claimed to be his wife.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.652
But I guess
he could have been
texting somebody else

28:17.696 --> 28:19.828
to mark those addresses
for later.

28:19.872 --> 28:23.179
The only reason they'd
wanna identify alien homes
is to target them.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.313
Yeah, but if they
were marking houses

28:26.356 --> 28:28.750
we would see that, right?
We would notice that.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.883
The marks might not be
visible to the naked eye.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.842
The mask had some kind of
night vision tech in them.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.715
Why did you
bring that to dinner?

28:36.758 --> 28:40.022
Oh, uh, I figured
if things got boring
I might just do a little work.

28:40.762 --> 28:41.807
Oh, look at that.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.810
Wait, that's
a low spectrum enhancer.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.507
You use it
to see infrared.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.987
Here,
let me see that.

28:52.513 --> 28:53.819
Look at that,
I see one there.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.909
Right, so they're
gonna attack.

28:57.518 --> 28:58.693
The question is, when?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.129
"Twilight's last gleaming."

29:00.173 --> 29:02.262
It's the title
of their manifesto.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.654
Tells them when to strike.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.874
Twilight's last gleaming
is sunset.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.876
Then we don't have much time.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.926
Great party, Thanksgiving.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.320
Um, here, look.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.669
Sunset is in 20 minutes.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.236
I gotta get to work
so can you give me a ride?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.325
Yup.

29:22.369 --> 29:24.893
Haley won't back us up
but I'll do what I can
at street level.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.852
I'll get rid of as many
markers as I can

29:26.895 --> 29:28.592
so they won't know
where to attack.

29:30.246 --> 29:31.944
I'm gonna go, too.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.772
I connected with Tom.
Maybe I can talk
some sense into them.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.211
And if they don't listen?

29:38.254 --> 29:39.995
Then I will find a way
to make them listen.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.823
That's not a plan.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.869
I don't have time
to talk about this right now.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.479
They don't have time
to talk, either. They're out
there looking for a fight.

29:45.522 --> 29:48.308
I appreciate the fact
that you're trying
to help me, I do,

29:48.351 --> 29:49.918
but I don't need it.
I'm gonna be fine.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.354
Right, because you
can handle it?

29:51.398 --> 29:53.487
Yes, I can handle myself.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.794
I don't need you freaking out
about every little problem
that I have in my life.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.579
Now, take the DA for example.

29:58.622 --> 29:59.928
You got all worked up
about that

29:59.972 --> 30:02.235
and it turned out
to be fine.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.845
Okay? I'm going.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.456
It was fine
because I made it fine.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.023
What are you talking about?

30:08.067 --> 30:10.112
I talked to the DA, James.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.071
I traded information
about Bruno Mannheim,

30:12.114 --> 30:13.550
she dropped the indictment.

30:15.422 --> 30:16.553
You did what?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.165
You heard me.

30:19.861 --> 30:20.862
You lied to me.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.039
I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

30:25.214 --> 30:27.564
I love you, and there is
no line in the universe

30:27.608 --> 30:29.349
I would not cross
to keep you safe.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.526
If that's what
you think love is,

30:34.049 --> 30:35.921
I'm not sure if I want
any part of that.

30:45.669 --> 30:50.152
Well, I guess this year
it's my job to say grace.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.985
I am thankful
for my family.

30:57.029 --> 31:00.641
You have believed in me,
you've supported me.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.645
Even though
I know it's been a struggle.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.954
I see your power,

31:09.911 --> 31:11.347
I see your strength,

31:12.348 --> 31:15.438
and there has been
so very much this year

31:16.831 --> 31:18.702
to fight against.

31:18.746 --> 31:22.141
But today,
you make me feel
like we can win again.

31:25.187 --> 31:28.103
Together we will rise
and we will overcome.

31:35.023 --> 31:36.155
Do not do this.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.939
These are choices
everyone has to make.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.028
It is my family first!

31:40.986 --> 31:43.205
Do not let your anger
become violence.

31:43.249 --> 31:45.338
There are lines
that we do not cross.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.341
Get out of my way!

31:56.349 --> 31:58.220
I just wanna
protect my family.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.571
You'd do the same thing.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.095
Not like this, I wouldn't.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.794
I don't think
I can find them all.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.405
Never fear.
I'm also on the streets
removing markers.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.584
In fact,
I see one right now.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.503
Hey,
what are you doing?

32:27.075 --> 32:29.077
Return to your homes.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.906
-Or else.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.213
Or else I'll be required
to beat you up.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.085
With physics.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.163
There's one!

33:17.343 --> 33:19.258
Get out here,
you filthy roaches!

33:34.708 --> 33:35.839
Sorry, Fi.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.103
I've got to do it my way.

33:40.757 --> 33:44.500
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

33:44.544 --> 33:45.675
Stay back.

33:46.589 --> 33:47.634
Can't hide, roach.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.336
This is our home!
We've lived here for years.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.947
You can't hide behind
that image inducer
any longer.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.876
Spike, do something. Please!

34:19.144 --> 34:20.232
What the hell?

34:35.377 --> 34:38.337
Alex, there's a dragon
on Main Street.

34:39.512 --> 34:42.123
That's what I get for making
a Harry Potter reference.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.146
I don't think he likes that.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.380
No! Don't hurt him!

36:05.424 --> 36:07.817
He's just trying
to protect us.

36:07.861 --> 36:11.734
Supergirl, hey,
I'm here with a little girl,
her name is Alana.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.823
So the dragon is her pet,
his name is Spike.

36:13.867 --> 36:17.349
And he's just acting
defensively, he's trying
to protect her family.

36:22.963 --> 36:25.139
Spike! Spike...

36:25.183 --> 36:27.663
Spike! Alana's safe.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.928
You did your job.
You protected her.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.279
You were loyal,
you were true.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.891
You kept everyone safe.

36:42.809 --> 36:43.984
Good boy.

36:48.771 --> 36:49.816
Huh!

36:57.389 --> 37:01.349
Well, dogs may not
like me anymore,

37:01.393 --> 37:02.872
but I still got it
with dragons.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.356
Director Danvers.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.491
Once again,
you and Supergirl have
disobeyed my direct orders.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.363
I told you
this manifesto was not
a matter of priority.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.322
Colonel Haley,
you have to--

37:17.365 --> 37:19.628
That said,

37:19.672 --> 37:22.544
the violent actions
of the Children of Liberty
are stirring

37:22.588 --> 37:26.548
National City's
most dangerous aliens
to defend themselves.

37:26.592 --> 37:29.377
And we must make sure
not to provoke them
any further.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.510
So, from this point forward

37:31.553 --> 37:33.686
we will consider
the Children of Liberty

37:33.729 --> 37:36.036
a matter of priority
for the DEO.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.345
Thank you, Colonel Haley.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.390
You are dismissed.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.440
Director Danvers.

37:50.964 --> 37:54.489
Don't think there is anything
that happens under my watch

37:54.533 --> 37:56.404
that I'm not aware of.

37:56.448 --> 38:00.582
I could've stopped
your little rogue
investigation at any moment.

38:00.626 --> 38:02.932
But I gave you just
enough rope to hang yourself.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.326
Fortunately for you,

38:05.370 --> 38:06.849
this time you had
a chair to stand on.

38:06.893 --> 38:09.591
But do not ever disobey
my direct orders again

38:09.635 --> 38:11.463
or there will be consequences.

38:12.812 --> 38:16.294
I followed my instincts
and they were right.

38:16.337 --> 38:21.908
And I will continue to do so
because that is what makes me
a great leader.

38:21.951 --> 38:24.476
And if that means
that you have to
court-martial me,

38:24.824 --> 38:25.912
then so be it.

38:35.400 --> 38:39.142
Once again,
the Girl of Steel proving
just what she's made of.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.361
Honey.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.363
Honey, you have a call.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.930
It's the woman
from the show.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.719
Hey, Sean,
how are you doing?

38:52.808 --> 38:54.114
Okay.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.554
Well, that's incredible.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.470
My own show.

39:02.514 --> 39:05.386
Uh, no, of course.
Of course!

39:06.518 --> 39:08.084
I would love to do it.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.740
Eliza left so soon.
She usually stays a few days.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.351
Mmm.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.005
She had to get to her,
let me see if I get
this right,

39:16.049 --> 39:20.227
ethno-xeno biology conference
where she is speaking about

39:20.270 --> 39:24.362
the regressive
hereditary traits
of inter-terrestrial children.

39:24.405 --> 39:28.409
Wow, I'm really glad
she didn't talk
to Nia about that

39:28.453 --> 39:30.629
'cause she would have
put her right to sleep.

39:30.672 --> 39:31.804
I did see the two
of them talking, though.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.501
Mom was trying
to find her a doctor,

39:33.545 --> 39:35.068
but Nia said
she already had one.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.418
That's weird.
She told me she
hadn't found one yet.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.941
Why would she lie about that?

39:41.117 --> 39:42.858
I'm sorry
you're worried about
your friend,

39:42.902 --> 39:45.644
but at least you got
Agent Haley to make
the Children of Liberty

39:45.687 --> 39:48.386
an urgent matter for the DEO.
That's a big win.

39:48.429 --> 39:52.694
Well, we did stop
the Children of Liberty from
hurting innocent aliens.

39:52.738 --> 39:55.741
But Agent Liberty
is still out there.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.831
And the rhetoric of hate
is growing.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.747
Just haven't figured out
how to win this fight yet.

40:01.790 --> 40:05.620
With so many people
siding with fear,
how far will this go?

40:05.664 --> 40:09.407
History tells us
moments like this can get
very, very ugly.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.191
I've seen it
with my own eyes.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.888
We won this time.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.674
But this is gonna be
a fight like no other.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.850
It's gonna be
one step forward
and two steps back.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.551
James.

40:24.639 --> 40:25.988
Thanks for meeting me.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.122
You saved my life.

40:29.165 --> 40:31.559
All those guys
I was supposed
to meet last night,

40:32.081 --> 40:33.909
they all went missing.

40:33.953 --> 40:36.608
Tom, the violence
is only gonna get worse
if we don't stop this now.

40:37.609 --> 40:38.827
Look,

40:39.915 --> 40:43.528
I don't have direct access
to Agent Liberty.

40:43.571 --> 40:45.704
But I can connect you
with people who do.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.577
But I...
I gotta warn you,

40:49.621 --> 40:51.057
these guys are dangerous.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.319
I gotta try, man.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.018
You need to take that?

40:56.062 --> 40:57.106
No.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.457
When can I meet these guys?

41:04.723 --> 41:05.724
Now.

41:11.817 --> 41:14.689
Ms. Luther?
Are you all right?

41:18.606 --> 41:20.303
It's getting more
dangerous out there.

41:22.523 --> 41:25.265
Feels like we're on
the verge of a civil war
with the aliens.

41:28.921 --> 41:31.097
The people we love
are gonna need
our protection.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.536
I want to move forward
with the haranel protocol.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.626
We're gonna need
a human subject.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.197
It's Caldwell.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.721
Okay, that's all I know.
I take my orders
from Caldwell.

41:46.765 --> 41:48.157
That's so odd.

41:48.201 --> 41:49.811
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

41:49.855 --> 41:51.683
Please, please,
you don't have to do this.
