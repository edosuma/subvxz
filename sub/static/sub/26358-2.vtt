05:09.787 --> 05:12.050
Sir, we have had
radio silence.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.357
There's been no way to
contact Hetty or Mosley.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.577
Do you have any intel on
the situation in Washington?

05:17.795 --> 05:20.450
I, um...

05:20.494 --> 05:23.148
I read the statement
you gave the ATF

05:23.192 --> 05:26.717
regarding Anna Kolcheck's
shooting.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.330
What about it?

05:31.722 --> 05:34.682
Well, from what I gather,
you told the truth.

05:34.725 --> 05:38.033
I did, but what does that
have to do with...?

05:38.076 --> 05:39.513
I was sent here

05:39.556 --> 05:41.123
to disband this team.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.608
I'm an old man, Callen...

05:47.651 --> 05:50.045
Okay.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.090
You didn't have
to agree with me.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.094
You are very young
and vibrant, sir.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.401
Huh.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.490
As an old man

06:00.534 --> 06:02.710
who has accomplished
what I have in life,

06:02.753 --> 06:05.974
I don't do a thing just because
someone told me to do it.

06:06.017 --> 06:09.717
So, when I was given
this assignment,

06:09.760 --> 06:12.720
I did my own research
on all of you.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.765
And?

06:18.247 --> 06:20.205
Well, I'll level
with you, Callen.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.686
Your team does not have
a good reputation.

06:22.730 --> 06:27.430
Reports of insubordination,
unauthorized missions,

06:27.474 --> 06:30.433
excessive use of force...

06:30.477 --> 06:32.566
Sir, it is not the team.
I am the one that has been...

06:32.609 --> 06:33.828
Easy.

06:33.871 --> 06:36.265
Nobody is gonna die
on his own sword today.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.571
Besides, that's Hetty's move.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.137
You get your own moves.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.313
Don't disband this team.

06:41.357 --> 06:44.142
Like I said, I don't do a thing

06:44.186 --> 06:47.798
simply because someone
told me to do it.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.800
I like what I read
about this team.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.628
You guys get results.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.022
Okay.

06:54.065 --> 06:59.331
You realize they're probably not
ever gonna let Hetty or Mosley

06:59.375 --> 07:01.029
set foot in here again.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.426
What I want to know from you,
before I invest

07:06.469 --> 07:11.822
any more time here is...
is this team capable

07:11.866 --> 07:15.217
of continuing on
without Henrietta Lange?

07:19.047 --> 07:21.049
Yes, sir.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.313
There it is, then.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.928
What do we got?

07:30.972 --> 07:32.452
NELL: Within this
office building

07:32.495 --> 07:34.932
is a large, highly
secured steel vault.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.760
Eight Rodeo Drive
businesses use it

07:36.804 --> 07:39.459
to store high-value
overflow inventory.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.591
Two security guards
were killed last night,

07:41.635 --> 07:43.419
two more are in critical
at Cedars.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.595
They've yet to regain
consciousness.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.597
$12 million in jewelry,

07:47.641 --> 07:49.425
loose diamonds, and
watches were stolen.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.948
Why are we pulling this case?

07:50.992 --> 07:52.646
Yeah, I feel like
LAPD Robbery-Homicide

07:52.689 --> 07:54.169
should be all over this.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.911
RHD did respond, although
their preliminary report

07:56.954 --> 07:58.608
of the crime scene
revealed the hallmark

07:58.652 --> 08:00.436
of military-grade explosives.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.351
Do we have footage of the heist?

08:02.394 --> 08:05.093
Mm. Conveniently, the
building's security cameras

08:05.136 --> 08:08.313
as well as alarm system went
down just before the robbery.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.054
Any 911 calls go out?

08:10.098 --> 08:11.708
Uh, the head of security,
an Officer Lynne,

08:11.752 --> 08:13.101
called it in during the attack.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.756
Beverly Hills PD responded
in under four minutes.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.409
So these guys took out
four guards,

08:17.453 --> 08:18.715
they got in and out
under five minutes?

08:18.759 --> 08:20.064
I mean, that's a tall order.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.631
DeCHAMPS: We're looking
at a tight crew.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.547
Yeah, that could explain why
they used military explosives.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.681
The heist team could be
a unit on active duty.

08:27.724 --> 08:31.249
Or a civilian team of pros
that stole military explosives.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.339
Oh, and Lieutenant Commander
Gomez, an explosives expert

08:34.383 --> 08:37.081
from the Naval Weapons Station
Seal Beach, is on her way now

08:37.125 --> 08:39.431
to the boatshed now to review
the forensics report.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.869
Well, Kensi, Deeks, you guys
talk to Commander Gomez.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.393
See if you can find out what
base the explosives came from.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.438
DeChamps and I will
hit the crime scene.

08:46.482 --> 08:47.788
On it.
Yep.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.575
DeCHAMPS: LAPD Forensics
prelim report just came in.

08:52.619 --> 08:56.579
There were two guards with
9mm handguns in this hallway.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.277
They shot a total of 15
rounds at the thieves.

08:59.321 --> 09:02.019
Two bullets were recovered
from the walls.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.195
15 shots, 13 hits.

09:04.239 --> 09:06.371
Zero dead bad guys.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.678
This heist team must
have had some good Kevlar.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.593
This hallway's kind of narrow.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.595
I'd say four shooters max.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.641
Anything more than that'd
slow 'em down.

09:16.164 --> 09:18.166
Check this out.

09:19.602 --> 09:23.563
It's huge. Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:23.606 --> 09:25.739
Shaq and Charles Barkley
teamed up for one last score.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.437
What?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.047
I expected more from you.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.620
This is where
things got real.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.101
Two guards with M4s
in this vault room.

09:40.144 --> 09:43.539
21 rounds fired before
the guards were dropped.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.629
Huh.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.153
Look at where they set
the explosives:

09:49.197 --> 09:51.721
door hinges
and the locking mechanism.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.594
But that door would have
stayed in place.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.639
It was moved
after the explosion?

09:56.683 --> 09:59.599
Maybe. It's real heavy, though.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.601
My theory about
Shaq and Barkley's

10:01.644 --> 10:04.212
not looking so bad now.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.869
It doesn't add up.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.653
There's one set
of boot prints,

10:10.697 --> 10:12.829
but how did they
move that door?

10:12.873 --> 10:14.875
NELL :
Hey, Sam

10:14.918 --> 10:18.487
I just found a camera that
caught the end of the heist.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.054
How many were there?

10:20.097 --> 10:24.624
I think you're gonna have to see
this footage for yourself.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.116
There was only one shooter?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.596
Yeah.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.120
What kind of body armor is that
and where do we get it?

10:43.164 --> 10:46.167
You can't. This is next-gen,
full-body, ballistic armor

10:46.210 --> 10:48.256
created exclusively
for the TALOS project.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.561
TALOS?

10:49.605 --> 10:52.956
It's a Tactical Assault
Light Operator Suit.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.479
After a firefight
in Afghanistan,

10:54.523 --> 10:57.352
Admiral McRaven made
the suit a priority.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.702
ERIC: Yeah, this was to be
full-body, ballistic,

10:59.746 --> 11:02.836
and blast protection mated
with a powered exoskeleton,

11:02.879 --> 11:04.881
targeting, and body
temperature regulation.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.230
This suit has all that?

11:06.274 --> 11:08.406
No, this does not seem
to be the end product.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.234
The crime scene makes sense now.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.888
It was all done
by this one shooter.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.411
Now, the suit's
various technologies

11:13.455 --> 11:15.936
are all in prototype stage,
but from what I can gather

11:15.979 --> 11:17.981
from crime scene reports
and this footage,

11:18.025 --> 11:19.940
what was used last night
was the full-body,

11:19.983 --> 11:21.463
ballistic protection
prototype.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.595
How many prototypes
were reported missing?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.249
None. Kensi and Deeks
are following up

11:25.293 --> 11:26.686
with the Navy on that.
Right.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.557
Oh, so it's looking
more and more like the suspect's

11:28.600 --> 11:30.385
gonna be current active duty.

11:30.428 --> 11:33.823
Now, the van that he got
into had fake dealer plates,

11:33.867 --> 11:37.435
but it's probably also
their mobile ops center

11:37.479 --> 11:39.220
used to knock out
the surveillance

11:39.263 --> 11:40.612
and alarm systems
on the target building.

11:40.656 --> 11:41.918
Any hits on the van?

11:41.962 --> 11:43.267
NELL:
Just one.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.616
Gas station cameras
caught it passing through

11:44.660 --> 11:46.270
this intersection in
Sherman Oaks last night.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.750
Well, that's something.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.100
All right. Well, stealing
the suit is a big task.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.798
This isn't gonna be
one and done for them.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.930
They have other targets in mind.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.846
Either in L.A. or somewhere
within driving distance.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.022
Now, if the van is
their mobile ops center,

11:59.066 --> 12:01.111
it's got a ton
of tech in it.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.373
I'm guessing that's
where they also

12:02.417 --> 12:03.940
recharge and
repair the suit.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.464
So, if we can find the van,
we most likely find the suit.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.902
Well, keep searching
for the van.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.642
And start a list of
potential targets.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.383
Based on what they
stole last night,

12:12.427 --> 12:15.691
they're looking for cash,
not terrorist goals.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.650
My God. Can you imagine
an active shooter scenario

12:18.694 --> 12:20.740
with this type of
ballistic armor?

12:20.783 --> 12:22.480
I don't want to, but I can.

12:22.524 --> 12:25.005
We'll go hit Sherman Oaks.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.746
Copy that.

12:26.789 --> 12:27.877
We'll keep you updated.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.749
Thanks.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.141
I can't believe
I'm seeing this.

12:31.185 --> 12:34.144
None of our TALOS technology
prototypes are missing.

12:34.188 --> 12:37.365
Well, obviously one is missing,
but nothing's been reported.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.670
Do you have any
idea which base

12:38.714 --> 12:39.671
something like this
would come from?

12:39.715 --> 12:41.195
That's above my pay grade,

12:41.238 --> 12:43.197
but what I can tell you

12:43.240 --> 12:46.200
is I reviewed the forensics
report on the explosives used

12:46.243 --> 12:48.506
and they were a highly
classified ordnance,

12:48.550 --> 12:50.682
which is good for us.In what way?

12:50.726 --> 12:53.773
Explosives like these
have markers in them.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.384
Like a code,
it allows us to determine

12:56.427 --> 12:57.689
exactly where they were stored.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.430
Okay, so where
are these from?

12:59.474 --> 13:02.433
The Naval Surface Warfare Center
in Port Hueneme,

13:02.477 --> 13:04.435
and like that ballistic suit,

13:04.479 --> 13:06.873
none of these explosives
have been reported missing.

13:20.887 --> 13:24.716
So, Ops had the van coming
down from that intersection.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.458
Could've ducked into
one of these alleyways.

13:27.502 --> 13:30.113
Well, this alley looks
especially nice to stroll down.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.854
You take a stroll
with me, Sam?

13:31.898 --> 13:35.075
Don't mind if I do.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.213
Callen's got one more
eval with the docs

13:43.257 --> 13:45.302
and then he thinks
he'll be ready to come back.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.348
And he addresses the
elephant in the alley.

13:47.391 --> 13:50.220
You give any thought
to what you're gonna do

13:50.264 --> 13:51.918
when he comes back?

13:51.961 --> 13:53.354
I've kind of been avoiding that.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.747
This team, working in L.A.,
it's been fun.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.880
And you fit in.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.664
Trust me, not everybody does.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.362
Thank you.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.233
San Diego's still at the top
of my list, though.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.627
Hetty says she'll give
a strong recommendation

14:05.670 --> 14:07.455
that you get
your first choice assignment.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.413
With all due respect
to your boss,

14:09.457 --> 14:11.546
what exactly does
Hetty's recommendation do for me

14:11.589 --> 14:12.895
given her tenuous status
right now?

14:12.939 --> 14:14.288
Oh, you have a point.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.159
Would you prefer Beale
writes up your letter of rec?

14:16.203 --> 14:19.380
I think I'll take my
chances with Hetty.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.904
Hey, guys.
I just got off the phone

14:21.948 --> 14:23.906
with Captain Walker,
the commanding officer

14:23.950 --> 14:26.300
at the Naval Surface Warfare
Center at Port Hueneme.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.780
It looks like the suit and
explosives were both stolen

14:28.824 --> 14:30.434
from their classified
test laboratory.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.784
The man in charge
of the secured storage facility,

14:32.828 --> 14:34.656
Master Chief Lincoln Briones,

14:34.699 --> 14:37.050
he should have recognized
that the inventory was missing

14:37.093 --> 14:38.573
and reported it stolen.

14:38.616 --> 14:39.922
KENSI: So where is
Master Chief Briones now?

14:39.966 --> 14:40.967
He's missing.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.620
They've searched
the base, his house.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.231
They're now trying to reach
out to his family members.

14:44.274 --> 14:45.319
He's a Navy SEAL.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.016
He specializes
in explosives.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.322
Yeah, he'd definitely
have the training

14:48.365 --> 14:49.801
to pull off something
like last night's heist.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.107
He's also six-three,

14:51.151 --> 14:53.109
roughly the same size
as last night's shooter.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.372
We are looking into everyone
Briones served with.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.287
Maybe someone was in the van
trying to help him out.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.507
Ooh, Eric just found something.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.944
Looks like Briones
rents an apartment

15:01.988 --> 15:06.775
for his nephew Jordan Abalos
in Torrance, California.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.298
Great. Send us the address.
We'll check it out.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.909
Will do.
Oh, and, guys...Yeah.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.998
Captain Walker said that
the amount of explosives

15:12.041 --> 15:13.564
used in the Beverly
Hills heist

15:13.608 --> 15:15.958
was only a third of what
was actually stolen.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.091
Which means they're
planning another hit.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.484
Yeah. Question is where?

15:20.528 --> 15:21.485
Thanks.
Nice work.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.704
Yeah.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.972
Sam, I've got the van.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.192
Footage from yesterday shows
the van entering

15:32.235 --> 15:34.803
the alleyway you're in.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.987
What's up, guys?

15:45.031 --> 15:47.729
You guys, uh, do work
on classics here?

15:47.772 --> 15:50.210
Like put TV monitors in a
Chevelle, stuff like that?

15:50.253 --> 15:51.863
Yeah, we could do that.

15:51.907 --> 15:56.216
You don't think TV monitors in a
Chevelle is, like, a major foul?

15:56.259 --> 15:58.261
Hey, man, it's your car.

15:58.305 --> 16:01.786
You know, I'd, uh,

16:01.830 --> 16:03.963
have to think twice
about someone

16:04.006 --> 16:06.704
who would put modern junk
in a classic.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.358
Then move on.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.707
What about vans?

16:09.751 --> 16:12.014
You guys work on vans?

16:12.058 --> 16:13.537
You know, the
big, modern ones?

16:13.581 --> 16:16.105
Didn't you have one here
last night?

16:16.149 --> 16:17.628
Who are you?

16:17.672 --> 16:18.890
Yo, what are you doing?

16:18.934 --> 16:19.891
You can't go back there.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.502
Federal agents. Where's the van?

16:22.590 --> 16:23.721
Gun!

16:25.941 --> 16:27.377
Whoa, whoa!

16:27.421 --> 16:29.771
Don't. Your move.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.643
Cuffs or a body bag?

16:55.362 --> 16:57.581
The van was here.
Now it's gone.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.930
What did you do with it?

16:58.974 --> 17:00.976
Man, I'm dead.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.500
The guys I work for run
the show in the prisons.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.589
You should've just
shot me back there.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.200
That option's
not off the table.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.853
Hank, we're federal agents.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.551
We can help ensure you do
your time in a prison

17:10.594 --> 17:11.900
where they can't reach you.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.510
You'd be safer locked up
in Utah, right?

17:13.554 --> 17:14.816
Are you kidding?

17:14.859 --> 17:16.252
You don't think they got
people in Orange County?

17:16.296 --> 17:19.168
Utah. The state.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.866
I didn't pay no attention
in geology class.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.086
Mm. Where's the van?

17:24.130 --> 17:25.392
I don't know.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.350
Enjoy prison.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.569
No, no, no, no!
It's not like that.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.049
Look, I want to do
my time in Utah,

17:30.092 --> 17:31.354
it's just, look,
they took the van.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.703
I don't know where.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.184
I'm still waiting to hear
something that helps us.

17:35.228 --> 17:38.274
Look, we run a
cleaning service.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.146
People roll vehicles
through here

17:40.189 --> 17:41.538
that have been used
in not so...

17:41.582 --> 17:42.713
So legal activities.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.106
That'll work.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.935
We dismantle them, we burn
what needs to be burned.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.371
You dismantled their van?

17:48.415 --> 17:51.374
Nah. There was some special
equipment in the back.

17:51.418 --> 17:52.767
We just painted it.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.247
What does it
look like now?

17:54.290 --> 17:56.727
Well, it's black now with
a limo company logo on it.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.599
Who brought it in?

17:58.642 --> 18:01.863
A man and a woman, but
they just talked to Ron.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.518
Homie dead now.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.780
That it?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.390
Yeah.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.133
Actually, no.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.483
They said they're gonna bring
the van back in for us

18:13.527 --> 18:15.703
to totally dismantle
and dispose of tonight.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.313
Yo, do they got
good food in Utah?

18:17.357 --> 18:18.575
The same TV shows
that we got?

18:18.619 --> 18:21.361
Stop talking.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.190
The van and the shooter
will be back here tonight.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.148
Yeah, but a sting's
out of the question.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.237
We got to find them before
they make that next heist.

18:28.281 --> 18:32.285
Nell, they're gonna be moving
in the next few hours.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.243
We're gonna come in and
look at potential targets.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.810
NELL:
Copy that, Sam.

18:35.853 --> 18:39.118
We're tied into LAPD and doing
joint targeting analysis.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.033
Let's ride.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.780
Huh? I think
it's a great idea.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.782
It's great.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.306
Really? Not too cheesy,
not too on the nose?

18:53.349 --> 18:55.351
No, it's... no, I think
it's cheesy and on the nose,

18:55.395 --> 18:57.919
but if you want to do
your bachelorette party

18:57.962 --> 18:59.964
in Napa doing wine tours
with your girlfriends,

19:00.008 --> 19:02.141
then bring on the cheese
and bring on the noses.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.707
I mean, it's your deal,

19:03.751 --> 19:05.796
and you're 100% never having
a bachelorette party again,

19:05.840 --> 19:07.624
so enjoy it.
Oh, really?

19:07.668 --> 19:09.191
All right. Yeah,
you're right.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.411
I don't care that other women
have been to Napa before.

19:11.454 --> 19:12.977
Okay, that's me.
What about you?

19:13.021 --> 19:14.457
What are you doing for
your bachelor party?

19:14.501 --> 19:16.155
What?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.895
I'm sorry, have we met?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.419
No, I know you don't like
going to bachelor parties,

19:19.462 --> 19:21.029
but I figured if
it's your own...

19:21.072 --> 19:23.205
Baby, I dislike bachelor parties
like I dislike the guys

19:23.249 --> 19:24.772
that use the phrase
"hall pass"

19:24.815 --> 19:26.861
when talking about going out
with their guy friends at night

19:26.904 --> 19:28.602
or saying that
they have to babysit

19:28.645 --> 19:29.777
even though the kid
is their own.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.213
And you know what
hall-pass guy

19:31.257 --> 19:33.476
and babysit guy love more
than anything in the world?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.130
BOTH:
Bachelor parties.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.914
So I'm gonna let them
carry on their tradition.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.916
I'm going surfing
with my friends.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.527
Deuces!

19:46.097 --> 19:47.795
KENSI:
301.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.666
Yeah.

20:10.731 --> 20:13.212
Clear.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.213
Yeah, we got a body.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.393
Kens?

20:23.961 --> 20:25.702
One...
Mm-hmm.

20:25.746 --> 20:26.921
two, three.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.535
I got something.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.060
Federal agents.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.889
You Jordan Abalos?

20:38.933 --> 20:41.109
Yeah. Yes. Is my uncle okay?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.770
Master Chief Briones--
not our shooter.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.250
Kensi and Deeks found him
shot dead.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.860
And the list of
potential targets in L.A.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.078
would be massive,

20:54.122 --> 20:56.080
so we worked with LAPD
and narrowed it down

20:56.124 --> 20:58.431
to potential targets
where the shooter's

20:58.474 --> 21:00.694
ballistic protections
would be valuable,

21:00.737 --> 21:03.044
aka places with armed guards.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.916
Okay.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.397
Let's remove all terrorist
and active shooter scenarios

21:08.441 --> 21:10.486
and stay with valuables
and cash targets.Okay.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.532
Here you go.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.185
This is beyond
a needle in a haystack.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.709
We need to find that van.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.798
Now, clearly there are a ton
of opportunities for them

21:17.841 --> 21:21.149
at banks and stores,
but check this out.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.890
The King Tut exhibit.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.327
Granted, they'd need
contacts in the art world,

21:25.371 --> 21:27.242
but if you're looking
at a ratio of dollars

21:27.286 --> 21:30.332
to amount of armed guards, this
is your top target in the city.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.421
Those artifacts
are literally priceless.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.684
Black market dealers,
collectors,

21:34.728 --> 21:37.339
certain governments even,
a lot of people would be willing

21:37.383 --> 21:39.733
to pay a whole lot of cash
for those items.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.604
The King Tut exhibit
is near a commercial bank

21:41.648 --> 21:42.779
with the highest cash reserves

21:42.823 --> 21:45.434
in the city
and the L.A. Federal Reserve.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.306
We should work with LAPD
on setting a perimeter.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.611
Yeah, okay.

21:48.655 --> 21:51.614
DeChamps and I'll assist LAPD.
Find that van.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.877
Yup, we're on it.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.923
Did you guys find
my aunt and cousin?

21:55.966 --> 21:57.316
Our team are searching
for them right now,

21:57.359 --> 21:58.621
and the Navy has been
looking for them

21:58.665 --> 21:59.709
ever since your
uncle went missing.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.058
You think they're
in danger?

22:01.102 --> 22:02.538
I know they are.

22:02.582 --> 22:05.367
The guy that took them
is Rob Durant.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.151
It was Rob and his girlfriend.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.544
He told my uncle that

22:08.588 --> 22:10.720
if he didn't work for them,
he'd kill both of them.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.332
Uh, explain to me why these
people would target your uncle.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.378
My uncle gave me everything,

22:16.422 --> 22:18.467
and I got him killed.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.643
It's all my fault.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.819
I just loved racing.

22:22.863 --> 22:25.474
And I was winning. I always won.

22:25.518 --> 22:26.997
Until you didn't.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.912
I lost my car.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.306
And you tried to buy it back?

22:31.350 --> 22:35.789
Yeah. I borrowed money
from Rob Durant.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.834
A guy I never should have
brought into my life.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.750
So Durant calls in the debt
and you don't have the cash.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.144
When I couldn't pay him,

22:43.187 --> 22:45.929
he found out that my uncle
was paying the rent here

22:45.973 --> 22:49.280
and that my uncle worked
at the Navy base.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.891
Hold on, Jordan,

22:50.934 --> 22:52.980
your uncle stole
highly classified equipment.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.286
How would Rob Durant even know
that that equipment was there?

22:55.330 --> 22:57.332
I don't think he did know.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.988
He just told my uncle to get him
the best weapons he could

23:01.031 --> 23:03.730
and that if he didn't like
what my uncle brought him,

23:03.773 --> 23:06.036
he'd shoot my aunt and cousin

23:06.080 --> 23:07.429
in front of him.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.213
So, please,

23:09.257 --> 23:10.911
you got to find them.We will find them.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.782
We have our best people on it,
I promise you.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.611
Rob's a beast,

23:15.655 --> 23:18.048
but his girlfriend
is straight crazy.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.835
They're gonna kill 'em.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.492
My cousin's
only eight years old.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.019
Okay.

23:41.898 --> 23:42.986
ERIC:
Kensi, I may have a location

23:43.030 --> 23:44.727
on Master Chief Briones' wife
Nancy.

23:44.771 --> 23:47.295
Her phone is located
at a mall in Burbank.

23:48.601 --> 23:51.081
We're in the south lot,
fourth row.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.692
ERIC: Silver Ford,
right in front of you.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.041
Got it. Deeks.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.738
Where?

23:55.782 --> 23:58.915
Eric says Briones' wife's phone
is on and pinging in this car.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.265
Nothing.
School said she
picked her up as usual.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.093
There's nothing inside.

24:03.137 --> 24:06.140
I got no wires. It looks clean.
Kensi, trunk.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.491
Okay.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.581
Come on, don't do this.
Come on, God.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.757
Oh, bingo.

24:14.801 --> 24:15.802
Okay.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.107
DEEKS:
Come on.

24:17.151 --> 24:17.978
Come here, baby girl,
come here, come here.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.632
Oh.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.329
You're okay, sweetie, okay.

24:21.372 --> 24:23.026
Okay, come here,
come here, come here.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.463
All right, come on, Mama.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.377
I got a pulse.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.296
Got you, Mama, you're okay.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.516
I got you.
I got you.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.475
Okay, breathe,
breathe, good work.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.824
Okay, breathe. That's right.
Good, breathe.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.782
I'm a federal agent.
You're okay.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.697
NANCY: Where is my daughter?DEEKS: She's right there,
she's right there.

24:41.741 --> 24:45.484
She's working on her.
Hold on. She's got to work.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.487
Come on, Callie.
Come on, sweetie.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.361
Callie, don't quit. Come on.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.843
There you go.
Open your eyes.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.845
Okay. There's Mommy,
there's Mommy.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.460
Hey, Beale.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.157
Go ahead.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.812
We got Nancy Briones
and her daughter Callie.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.161
They're alive.
Please send an ambulance.

25:11.205 --> 25:13.512
Sending now.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.527
Admiral.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.050
Oh, I like that.
It's strong.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.356
And I've never had a girlfriend
give me a pet name before.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.575
It's kind of hot...Shut up, Beale.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.578
Admiral Kilbride.

25:36.622 --> 25:40.495
I see you've upgraded your
wardrobe to include trousers.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.323
Well, I, um...

25:42.366 --> 25:45.892
I'm no longer undercover with
that killer surf gang, so I...

25:45.935 --> 25:48.329
You have the identity
of our shooter?

25:48.372 --> 25:50.940
Thought you'd never ask.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.377
That would be
Rob Durant.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.510
Grew up in Culver City,

25:55.554 --> 25:58.034
decorated high school
and college wrestler.

25:58.078 --> 26:00.950
He spent five years on
Sacramento PD's SWAT team,

26:00.994 --> 26:03.692
until he was fired in 2012
for insubordination.

26:03.736 --> 26:06.347
NELL:
Two years ago, he was
a person of interest

26:06.390 --> 26:08.001
in a bank robbery in Camarillo,

26:08.044 --> 26:10.699
though the FBI was unable
to make a case on him.

26:10.743 --> 26:13.876
He'll know how to make the most
of that ballistic armor.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.574
Mm

26:15.617 --> 26:18.402
That would be his girlfriend,
Rachel Conway.

26:18.446 --> 26:21.710
She's been in and out of jail
from the time she was 18.

26:21.754 --> 26:25.888
Her arrests alternate between
assaults and cybercrimes.

26:25.932 --> 26:28.412
Nice couple.

26:28.456 --> 26:31.981
Hope the Timeshas space for
their engagement announcement.

26:32.025 --> 26:33.853
Let me know
when you find that van.

26:33.896 --> 26:36.769
Will do, Admiral.

26:37.944 --> 26:39.423
Okay, LAPD's got
a perimeter set up

26:39.467 --> 26:41.425
around the California Science
Center and Federal Reserve.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.079
I told them we'd handle
the commercial bank.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.777
I checked out
the Science Center.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.083
If the King Tut exhibit
is the target,

26:47.127 --> 26:48.781
I'd say they're going
in loud and aggressive,

26:48.824 --> 26:50.739
right through
the front door.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.262
It's the most
direct path.

26:52.306 --> 26:53.568
Should it be
shut down?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.439
Nell's talking to the
LAPD chief of police.

26:55.483 --> 26:56.702
It's his call.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.269
No evidence pointing
to a specific target,

26:59.313 --> 27:01.184
he'd have to shut
the entire city down.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.751
We need to hit
the commercial bank.

27:02.795 --> 27:06.712
Let's do it.

27:06.755 --> 27:09.018
So, one day soon,
entire SEAL Teams

27:09.062 --> 27:11.194
will be outfitted
with this ballistic armor?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.935
The armor is one thing.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.676
But if they continue
to make advancements

27:14.720 --> 27:16.939
in the exoskeleton technology,

27:16.983 --> 27:18.375
if they can amplify

27:18.419 --> 27:20.856
an operator's natural
strength and speed...

27:20.900 --> 27:23.119
We'll have a team of Sam Hannas.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.295
Yeah, exactly.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.994
Whoa, check this out.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.778
Hey, Sam, we just got the van

27:29.822 --> 27:33.042
exiting the 91 Freeway
in Gardena.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.914
All right, send the top ten
targets in Gardena

27:34.957 --> 27:36.089
to my phone.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.481
Yup, on it.

27:37.525 --> 27:40.223
ERIC: Sam, based on info
from Port Hueneme,

27:40.267 --> 27:43.313
beyond the full-body
ballistic protection,

27:43.357 --> 27:46.447
this suit has pneumatic
and hydraulic enhancements

27:46.490 --> 27:47.970
made to two joints,

27:48.014 --> 27:49.711
the left shoulder
and left elbow.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.365
Now, to what extent
those are functional,

27:51.408 --> 27:53.628
in this particular prototype,
is unclear.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.675
Copy that.
Thanks, Eric.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.808
NELL:
Sir, I've located
the heist van.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.723
It got off the
freeway in Gardena.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.551
Now, Sam and DeChamps
are headed over

28:03.594 --> 28:05.553
to Gardena Casino
and Card Room,

28:05.596 --> 28:08.208
while Kensi and Deeks
are routed over across town

28:08.251 --> 28:09.731
to Gardena
West Savings Bank,

28:09.775 --> 28:12.429
which happens to be the largest
cash reserve in that city.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.954
Is LAPD preparing to go
on full tactical alert?

28:14.997 --> 28:16.564
That would be
a yes.

28:16.607 --> 28:19.175
Tell them now might be the time
to pull the trigger on that,

28:19.219 --> 28:22.004
and inform Gardena PD
that this suit

28:22.048 --> 28:24.615
has extreme
ballistic protection

28:24.659 --> 28:27.053
and that we have plainclothes
agents on the ground.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.184
Copy that.
And, Nell.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.446
Mm

28:29.490 --> 28:31.710
Tell Agent Hanna
that his primary concern

28:31.753 --> 28:34.234
is to contain the shooter.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.759
We cannot have a replay
of the North Hollywood shootout.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.848
Yes, sir.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.208
SAM:
There it is.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.862
DeCHAMPS:
Nell, we have eyes on the van.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.386
The target is the Gardena
Casino and Card Room.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.084
Repeat, the target
is the casino.

28:58.127 --> 29:01.522
Reroute all LAPD and Gardena PD
assets to our location.

29:01.565 --> 29:02.871
Copy that, DeChamps.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.526
LAPD will set up a perimeter
around the casino.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.093
Kensi and Deeks are
six minutes out.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.225
LAPD SWAT is
eight minutes out.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.272
SAM:
Tell casino security to lock
down. Nobody in or out.

29:12.315 --> 29:15.710
All right,
firing from a distance

29:15.754 --> 29:17.320
won't do the
damage we need.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.800
Got it. Where do you
want to engage?

29:18.844 --> 29:21.063
Best bet is to get him
after he exits the van

29:21.107 --> 29:22.412
but before he enters the casino.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.110
Use the casino wall
to our advantage.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.677
Exactly. Keep him on the ropes,
boxed in.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.201
Got it?

29:34.555 --> 29:36.165
All right. Okay.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.428
Soon as you see an opening,
you hit that van.

29:38.472 --> 29:39.821
We don't know what kind
of firepower

29:39.865 --> 29:40.996
his girlfriend has in there.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.171
DeCHAMPS:
Copy that.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.173
SAM:
We're gonna approach on a "V."

29:44.217 --> 29:46.436
Stay behind the cover,
make your shots count,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.438
look for seams and joints
in the armor.

29:48.482 --> 29:52.355
We got this. Go.

30:25.519 --> 30:26.955
Federal agent!

30:26.999 --> 30:28.174
Stop!

30:29.001 --> 30:30.524
Drop your weapon!

30:33.875 --> 30:34.833
Stop!

30:47.541 --> 30:49.717
Cover me!

30:53.939 --> 30:56.550
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

30:56.593 --> 30:58.378
Federal agent.
Get out, stay low.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.253
Moving to the van!

31:04.297 --> 31:06.603
Copy!

31:18.920 --> 31:20.791
Don't shoot!Drop your weapon.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.533
Hands behind your head,
on your knees.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.278
Hands behind your head!

32:09.101 --> 32:11.233
Tell PD to get back!

32:32.863 --> 32:34.648
Hey, so we were just
in the neighborhood,

32:34.691 --> 32:36.476
thought we'd roll in
for some pai gow.

32:36.519 --> 32:38.086
His ballistic
armor's no joke.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.784
I hit him center mass,
head shots-- nothing.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.482
So what's the play?

32:42.525 --> 32:44.440
I don't think
guns are the answer.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.616
So what, like,
mediation, arbitration?

32:46.660 --> 32:48.270
I could rent us out
a conference room.

32:49.619 --> 32:50.794
Rifle clear.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.796
Are you sure
you want to do that?

32:52.840 --> 32:54.624
Got to get him off his feet.

32:54.668 --> 32:55.843
All right,
what do you want us to do?

32:55.886 --> 32:57.236
Just light him up.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.889
Give me a chance
to get close to him.

32:58.933 --> 33:00.326
All right, on it.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.154
One, two, three.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.066
All right, all right. Stay down.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.547
Stay down.I'm good, I'm good.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.723
Okay.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.769
Stay down, tough guy.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.033
Stay down.

33:57.513 --> 33:58.993
All right.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.522
Hey, I was, uh, I was actually
just coming to look for you.

34:06.566 --> 34:07.958
So, I just gave
Admiral Kilbride

34:08.002 --> 34:10.526
the after action report
while walking to his car.

34:10.570 --> 34:14.443
So, wait, what was, uh,
Rob Durant's endgame?

34:14.487 --> 34:17.446
Yeah, so CSU found a list
of potential dates and targets

34:17.490 --> 34:18.969
on the computer in the van.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.059
It looks like it was
just all about the money.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.712
Durant had always been
a heist man,

34:22.756 --> 34:25.063
and with that sort
of ballistic armor...

34:25.106 --> 34:27.326
It made him feel,
like, superhuman.

34:27.369 --> 34:28.805
Yeah.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.286
Ooh. You know what we need?

34:31.330 --> 34:32.983
A little Grand Central Market.

34:33.027 --> 34:36.378
Beer, brats,
McConnell's Ice Cream.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.553
What do you think?

34:37.597 --> 34:39.555
Um...

34:39.599 --> 34:41.340
Good. Yeah.Cool?

34:41.383 --> 34:42.341
Sounds... good.

34:42.384 --> 34:43.690
Ac

34:43.733 --> 34:45.039
That sounds--
that sounds great,

34:45.083 --> 34:47.476
'cause I've been wanting
to incorporate more, um,

34:47.520 --> 34:49.391
beer and brats into
the dietary motif...

34:49.435 --> 34:50.740
:
Beale.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.394
What's-what's going on here,
Beale?

34:52.438 --> 34:55.658
What? Um, nothing.
I don't

34:55.702 --> 34:59.184
Like, with you
and the level of awkwardness.

34:59.227 --> 35:00.924
It's more than usual.

35:02.274 --> 35:06.843
A situation has come up,
and it's a business thing,

35:06.887 --> 35:09.063
but not, like, a
businessbusiness thing.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.760
It's like the universe or Yoda

35:10.804 --> 35:13.111
or whatever higher power
you believe in telling me

35:13.154 --> 35:15.591
to do something that I have
wanted to do for a while.

35:15.635 --> 35:17.115
Okay.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.117
But I don't know if I can,

35:19.160 --> 35:20.770
because I don't
want you to think

35:20.814 --> 35:23.860
that it's just a financial
decision and not because...

35:23.904 --> 35:26.254
Because what?

35:26.298 --> 35:29.257
Because I've never
been this happy,

35:29.301 --> 35:31.825
and I never want to be
somewhere where you aren't.

35:31.868 --> 35:35.220
Wow. That is ridiculously cute,

35:35.263 --> 35:38.701
but I'm still pretty confused.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.399
Yeah. I get that.Yeah.

35:40.442 --> 35:43.141
Maybe I should
just blurt it out.

35:43.184 --> 35:46.796
Ooh. You should, just blurt.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.884
Yeah.
Okay.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.887
My landlord
is selling my place,

35:50.931 --> 35:53.151
and I need to move out.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.152
Ah...

35:54.195 --> 35:55.631
And I want to
find a new place

35:55.675 --> 35:57.981
but, like, a nice
place, right?

35:58.025 --> 35:59.853
But I don't want
you to think

35:59.896 --> 36:01.681
that I'm asking you
what I'm about to ask you...I know.

36:01.724 --> 36:03.639
just because my landlord
got a sweet deal

36:03.683 --> 36:05.075
on a condo in Ala Moana

36:05.119 --> 36:06.555
and needs that money
to move to Hawaii.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.952
I would love
to move in with you.

36:11.995 --> 36:14.346
Really?

36:14.389 --> 36:17.131
Really.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.480
Where should we live?

36:19.525 --> 36:20.700
Should we get a dog?Beale!

36:20.743 --> 36:23.050
Brats, beer. Onward.Okay, wait.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.792
We work long hours. Maybe
we should get a cat. A cat!

36:28.229 --> 36:30.013
You're still limping?

36:30.057 --> 36:31.537
Man, I'm the one
with the broken back.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.321
Can't you just say hello?

36:33.365 --> 36:36.455
We have the best tacos
in all the land.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.457
Uh, yeah, no, that's not true.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.024
If they were the best tacos,
they would be Tito's Tacos,

36:41.068 --> 36:43.766
but he didn't want them,
so we have truck tacos.

36:43.810 --> 36:47.205
Yes, Mariscos Jalisco
serves tacos off a truck,

36:47.248 --> 36:48.728
but no, my friends, these
are not just truck tacos,

36:48.771 --> 36:51.644
these are little
culinary masterpieces.

36:51.687 --> 36:52.862
Besides, babe,
everybody knows:

36:52.906 --> 36:54.516
the best tacos in L.A.
come off of a truck.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.476
They asked to choose the food, I
said yeah, and now here we are.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.304
They haven't stopped talking
since we left the office.

37:00.522 --> 37:01.741
Are you still living
upstairs?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.917
My place is compromised.
I won't go back.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.788
I was actually gonna
look for a new spot,

37:05.832 --> 37:07.355
but this rehab schedule's

37:07.399 --> 37:09.357
been a little rougher
than I anticipated.

37:09.401 --> 37:11.229
What?

37:11.272 --> 37:13.361
This is perfect.What is perfect?

37:13.405 --> 37:14.754
You can live above the bar.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.234
We have an apartment
above the bar.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.192
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...

37:18.236 --> 37:19.411
Callen, this is
not a good idea.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.108
That room above the bar
is not an apartment.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.936
What are you talking about?
We get free security.

37:22.979 --> 37:24.503
He's like the last
American ninja,

37:24.546 --> 37:27.114
and he gets a off-the-grid
undisclosed location

37:27.157 --> 37:29.508
for him and all
his aliases.Yeah, I don't know...

37:29.551 --> 37:32.119
It'd be free....why I wouldn't
check that out.

37:32.162 --> 37:35.078
Wow. You'd consider
living above the bar?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.515
It wouldn't be the first time.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.386
This is a great plan.SAM:
Interesting.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.780
Well, I heard your paperwork
came back from the doctors

37:40.823 --> 37:42.129
and you're cleared
to come back to work,

37:42.172 --> 37:43.435
so welcome home, partner.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.784
Thank you.
KENSI:
Cheers.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.176
To Callen.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.178
Cheers.
Cheers.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.180
And to his new apartment.Yeah.

37:50.224 --> 37:51.747
You guys don't want a...
where you going?

37:51.791 --> 37:52.922
Want a shrimp taco?

37:52.966 --> 37:54.097
We got to do something.

37:54.141 --> 37:55.403
You want some help
with that, or...?

37:55.447 --> 37:57.405
No, no, no, no, no!
Well, you go have fun.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.799
We'll eat the tacos. Bye, boys.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.455
I got these.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.589
CALLEN:
Ms. Hidoko?

38:07.633 --> 38:10.940
Yes. You must be Callen and Sam.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.551
Would you like
anything to drink?

38:12.594 --> 38:13.595
No, thank you.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.729
Thank you for inviting me here.

38:16.772 --> 38:19.079
Harley spoke so highly
of the two of you.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.255
Thank you for being
so kind to her.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.909
Well, she was a superb agent,

38:22.952 --> 38:25.128
and she had
a very bright future.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.348
I'm very sorry for your loss,
Ms. Hidoko.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.394
It's Shirley, please.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.396
Shirley, look,
if there's anything

38:31.439 --> 38:34.660
that Sam and I can do for you,
just ask.

38:37.140 --> 38:41.014
Harley was the one
who came to my house

38:41.057 --> 38:44.626
to tell me that my son had
been killed in Afghanistan.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.412
I learned that day

38:47.455 --> 38:51.633
that I lost a son and gained
a daughter-in-law.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.809
We don't have
to talk about this.

38:53.853 --> 38:57.247
Wayne never really
wanted anything

38:57.291 --> 38:59.815
except a career in the military.

38:59.859 --> 39:03.384
He was very close
to his grandfather.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.343
I read his file.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.823
His grandfather served
with honor in the 442nd

39:07.867 --> 39:10.130
under Colonel Bert Nishimura.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.784
Yes, he did,

39:11.827 --> 39:13.829
but that wasn't the
grandfather I was speaking of.

39:13.873 --> 39:18.921
Wayne was very close
to my father.

39:18.965 --> 39:22.577
Um, before the war,
my father helped run

39:22.621 --> 39:26.755
the family gas station
in West L.A. on Sawtelle.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.104
They did very well.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.498
They owned a house, cars.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.240
It was all taken from them.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.373
All of it, everything.

39:35.416 --> 39:39.507
They were rounded up,
put on trains,

39:39.551 --> 39:43.381
with just a suitcase
and the clothes they wore.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.948
Sent to an internment camp
in Wyoming

39:45.992 --> 39:47.515
to live in sheds.

39:47.559 --> 39:49.299
It's awful.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.520
My father was very angry.

39:52.564 --> 39:57.873
Others at the time, they fell
in line, persevered, made due.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.223
But my father held
onto that anger.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.225
He fought,

40:02.269 --> 40:04.880
they beat him,
he fought again.

40:04.924 --> 40:07.883
He almost died
in that camp.

40:07.927 --> 40:12.888
My father hated them for taking
away the family house,

40:12.932 --> 40:16.326
their business,
their future.

40:16.370 --> 40:19.634
Well, he had every right
to feel that way.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.723
Wayne loved
my father.

40:21.767 --> 40:24.204
When he died,

40:24.247 --> 40:29.035
Wayne told me
he was going to enlist.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.691
He was going to excel
in the military,

40:32.734 --> 40:35.302
rise up, then politics.

40:35.345 --> 40:38.479
He was going to make sure
that what happened

40:38.523 --> 40:42.657
to my father never, ever
happened to another person

40:42.701 --> 40:44.137
in America again.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.183
The son you raised was
an exceptional human being.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.232
An exceptional
American.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.495
I know that.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.497
And I came to learn
that Harley loved him

40:56.541 --> 40:59.152
with every ounce of her being.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.156
Can we do anything for you?

41:03.199 --> 41:05.811
How about
the next time

41:05.854 --> 41:07.595
the three of us meet
at a restaurant,

41:07.639 --> 41:10.859
have a dinner
with real, actual food?

41:10.903 --> 41:15.037
Shirley Hidoko, you have a deal.
