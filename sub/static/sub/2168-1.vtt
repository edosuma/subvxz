01:29.549 --> 01:32.719
My crew has just returned
from 76 days at sea.

01:36.055 --> 01:39.517
The Americans are massing
naval assets in the Pacific.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.729
There must be a dozen boats
better rested.

01:45.023 --> 01:46.858
Squadron Command is insisting

01:47.025 --> 01:49.444
on the most experienced
captain and crew available.

01:49.611 --> 01:52.697
I'm being retired, remember?

01:52.864 --> 01:56.701
You should know that.
Your signature's all over the transfer.

01:56.868 --> 02:00.079
Even if I wasn't,
my boat will be in dry dock for months.

02:00.705 --> 02:04.709
You won't be sailing your boat.
You'll be sailing the B-67.

02:11.299 --> 02:14.511
The irony is a bit excessive,
don't you think?

02:14.677 --> 02:15.720
Under the circumstances,

02:15.887 --> 02:19.224
we were unable to get all of
your crew back from holiday.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.059
Naturally, they'll be replaced.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.816
The 67 is being decommissioned.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.651
Considering your history,

02:29.818 --> 02:32.111
command wanted to honor you
with her last patrol.

02:32.278 --> 02:33.446
Honor me?

02:33.613 --> 02:37.492
The Navy's an unforgiving place.
We're both proof of that.

02:38.535 --> 02:40.745
What'll happen to her after?

02:40.912 --> 02:44.290
Will they cut her up in Polyarny
or just let her bleed rust in Murmansk?

02:44.457 --> 02:48.670
She'll be stripped of her sensitive
equipment, refitted for her new life...

02:48.837 --> 02:50.588
in the Chinese navy.

02:50.755 --> 02:53.550
I'd rather see her on the bottom
than sold to our enemies.

02:53.716 --> 02:56.177
A nuclear navy has
to be subsidized, Demi.

02:56.344 --> 03:01.057
What better way to profit than by
arming Peking with our museum pieces.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.938
I read the academy's gonna
be named for your father.

03:07.564 --> 03:09.023
That's right.

03:09.816 --> 03:12.610
Greatness casts a long shadow.

03:16.781 --> 03:20.702
Do you think we can be redeemed
for the things we've done?

03:23.454 --> 03:25.081
I don't know.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.003
In our dreams, maybe.

03:31.629 --> 03:35.425
And if there is such a thing,
it surely requires opportunity.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.430
And here she is, knocking.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.561
Two lovely ladies

03:47.395 --> 03:49.855
and two bottles! Now...

03:49.856 --> 03:51.357
- Oh, yeah.
- There...

03:51.524 --> 03:54.027
- No, no, no, no, no!
- ...and there.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.570
Here...

03:59.282 --> 04:04.203
And fill it up
for my soon-to-be-married friend, Sasha!

04:08.833 --> 04:10.001
Captain on deck!

04:20.303 --> 04:24.849
To men of salt,
the women who endure us,

04:25.016 --> 04:26.851
and to my friend, our captain.

04:27.018 --> 04:28.394
The captain!

04:38.821 --> 04:41.115
Three weeks back,
I'm still spittin' up diesel.

04:41.282 --> 04:44.327
Maybe life will be sweeter without
the taste of fuel oil in your mouth.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.378
You'd better take a look at this.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.089
Don't fight me now!

05:06.224 --> 05:07.350
Listen up.

05:11.187 --> 05:13.231
We're to return to sea.

05:13.398 --> 05:15.692
- What?
- Take the ladies.

05:15.858 --> 05:17.151
- Take-take-take them.
- Come on.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.404
Let's go.

05:20.905 --> 05:25.535
We're supposed to have three months
back, not-not-not three weeks.

05:25.702 --> 05:28.371
Captain, I'm getting married to Nadya.

05:30.206 --> 05:34.252
Say your good-byes quickly
and without explanation.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.922
You have until 1400 hours.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.383
Sorry, gentlemen.

05:41.426 --> 05:44.387
This is shit!

06:35.646 --> 06:37.482
I'm sorry, Sophi.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.489
And grant length of days,

06:44.655 --> 06:48.242
fair children, progress in life
and faith through the prayers

06:48.409 --> 06:52.663
of the holy Theotokos
and all of his saints.

06:56.667 --> 07:01.964
Only God now can separate
what he hath joined here today.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.722
All right, sailor, stand down.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.852
Congratulations, Nadya.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.479
Thank you, Captain.

07:20.149 --> 07:21.734
You'll grow into it.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.569
You have two hours.

07:25.196 --> 07:27.198
Thank you, Captain.

07:27.365 --> 07:28.991
Congratulations.

07:34.455 --> 07:38.417
I remember you standing here
when you made your vows.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.671
It seems a long time ago.

07:41.838 --> 07:47.218
You wonder why he is silent
and you have so many questions.

07:47.385 --> 07:52.390
It was always, pretty much,
a one-way conversation.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.018
Thank you, Father,
for getting up so early.

07:58.062 --> 08:02.483
It's as much about what he hears
as what he says.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.029
Would you like to make a confession?

08:10.825 --> 08:12.994
Confession for what?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.082
Thank you, Father.

08:35.433 --> 08:36.517
Captain.

08:46.319 --> 08:49.530
- Captain.
- Mr. First Officer.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.866
Do you know what's going on?

08:52.033 --> 08:53.784
Sophi baked us some tea cakes.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.913
You realize that we're
supposed to sail this thing.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.290
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah. What happened with Markov?

08:59.457 --> 09:01.250
Ship is fueled, sir.
Batteries are serviced.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.377
Weapons systems are
being loaded and inspected.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.264
I'm sorry we out
into your honeymoon, Golov.

09:05.296 --> 09:06.816
Well, we made the most of it, Captain.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.466
I'm sure you did.

09:12.428 --> 09:13.471
Captain.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.761
Account for all ship's company.
I want a full report.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.487
- Aye, Captain.
- Would you like a tea cake?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.812
- Thank you, sir.
- No, thank you.

09:24.649 --> 09:26.689
I didn't think you could
go backwards from a diesel,

09:26.692 --> 09:29.904
but we're gonna need an archeologist
just to start this thing.

09:30.071 --> 09:32.657
Look at this thing. I mean...

09:34.659 --> 09:36.994
She was my first boat.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.206
We share a lot of history.

09:40.373 --> 09:43.376
Markov wanted me
to have her last sail.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.420
Last chance.

09:47.797 --> 09:49.006
Thank you.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.345
Captain.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.461
These are technicians
from the Special Projects Institute.

09:58.516 --> 10:00.017
They'll be joining us on this cruise.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.021
They're testing
some kind of prototype equipment.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.232
You ever been to sea before?

10:06.399 --> 10:09.318
We've spent
some time on ships, yes.

10:09.485 --> 10:12.780
- Skimmer's a vacation, Mister...?
- Bruni.

10:12.947 --> 10:17.368
Mr. Bruni. This ship barely accommodates
the 86 men required to sail her.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.537
We'll try to stay out
of your way then.

10:19.704 --> 10:21.664
Good luck with that.

10:22.999 --> 10:25.710
Mr. Pavlov will see you
to your berths. Stow your gear.

10:26.544 --> 10:28.379
We'll sail with the tide.

10:30.298 --> 10:31.299
Captain.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.346
It's good to see you again.

10:43.811 --> 10:47.565
Gentlemen? This way.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.388
Lock the hatch!

11:47.249 --> 11:48.250
Captain on deck.

11:50.795 --> 11:52.546
As you were.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.261
The last of the replacements
have reported aboard

11:59.428 --> 12:00.971
and been assigned to their divisions.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.891
Weapons are stowed
and the missile is secure.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.977
Maneuvering watch is set,
line handlers are topside.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.563
- Weather report?
- Fair seas.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.732
Some pack ice offshore.
Shouldn't be a problem.

12:11.899 --> 12:12.983
Good.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.655
Bring all diesels online.
This is the captain.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.949
Aye, sir.

12:27.790 --> 12:31.752
Mr. Pavlov and friends are
waiting for you in your stateroom.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.755
Lucky me.

12:44.014 --> 12:48.436
Our orders, Captain.
To be opened once we're safely at sea.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.239
Our firing keys.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.293
I'll see you up top.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.344
Bowlines away!

13:29.602 --> 13:32.021
- Secure the hatch!
- Aye, sir. Secure the hatch.

13:32.188 --> 13:34.482
Ready compartment for sea, gentlemen.

14:29.286 --> 14:32.456
I'm always surprised
it isn't harder to leave than it is.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.377
We all go the same way
on a boat, I guess.

14:37.962 --> 14:39.964
You don't find that ashore very often.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.466
It's a sickness.

14:43.968 --> 14:45.427
How's Alena?

14:48.138 --> 14:50.140
- She's used to it.
- And the boys?

14:50.307 --> 14:55.104
They have their studies, hockey.
They're busy, you know?

14:57.815 --> 15:00.067
When we clear the sea wall,
we'll take her down.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.402
Aye.

15:03.779 --> 15:05.364
What do you think that is?

15:07.283 --> 15:11.328
That, Mr. First Officer,
is the shortest distance

15:11.495 --> 15:13.622
between here and your own command.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.793
You haven't gone unnoticed
by Fleet, Alex.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.629
You're gonna get an atom smasher.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.381
Markov told me himself.

15:24.216 --> 15:27.177
So we'd do well not to screw this up.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.179
Thank you.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.016
You deserve it.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.478
Clear the decks. Secure the bridge.

15:37.438 --> 15:39.023
She's your ship to sail.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.317
Lookouts below, secure the bridge.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.903
Lookouts below,
secure the bridge.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.072
Clear the deck.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.576
Why don't you go?
I'd like a minute.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.339
Captain on deck.
Bridge is clear.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.008
Hatches are secure.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.345
Sonar, depth under the keel?

16:09.511 --> 16:10.679
Two hundred meters, Captain.

16:10.846 --> 16:11.972
Very well.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.564
Engineer, secure diesels,
ahead one-third

16:20.731 --> 16:22.816
on port and starboard motors.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.360
Prepare to dive.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.252
- Belay the dive.
- Belay the dive!

16:42.419 --> 16:44.046
- Belay the dive!
- Belay the dive!

16:48.384 --> 16:50.761
All departments report.
Account for all crew.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.931
Send the messenger topside.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.612
- Check the starboard bow.
- Bow clear.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.032
Do you hear that?

17:13.784 --> 17:16.369
- No.
- Decks are clear, sir.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.210
- Dive the boat.
- Midships valves open. Dive the boat.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.421
Dive the boat!

17:34.388 --> 17:35.431
Decks awash.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.769
Five degrees down bubble,
make your depth 50 meters.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.980
Five degrees down bubble.
Level at 50 meters.

17:43.147 --> 17:44.815
Fifty meters.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.484
Sonar, report.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.528
No contacts, sir.

17:50.988 --> 17:53.449
Navigator, plot us
a course for blue water.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.992
We're going deep.

17:55.159 --> 17:56.201
Aye, sir.

17:57.828 --> 17:58.996
Who the hell are you?

17:59.163 --> 18:02.207
- Bavenod, sir.
- Where'd command scrape you up from?

18:02.374 --> 18:05.252
- I came off a November.
- Really?

18:07.629 --> 18:09.923
You traded a nuke for a smoker?

18:10.090 --> 18:12.092
I heard the best crews
in the Navy sail diesels.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.970
I wanted a chance at one
before they're all gone.

18:16.472 --> 18:18.766
You see? Dreams do come true.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.311
Make our heading zero-nine-five.

18:22.478 --> 18:25.606
- Let me know when we make the shelf.
- Aye, Captain.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.151
All ahead standard.
Mr. Kozlov has the con.

18:29.318 --> 18:30.861
Aye, Captain.

18:31.028 --> 18:33.655
You heard right about diesel crews,
Bavenod.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.283
Yes, sir.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.704
Captain.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.309
- Captain?
- What the hell's going on, here?

19:02.476 --> 19:05.729
Only personnel with a security
clearance are permitted in this room.

19:05.896 --> 19:06.897
By whose authority?

19:07.064 --> 19:09.441
When you open your orders,
you'll understand.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.613
A lot of noise topside.

19:14.780 --> 19:18.575
- Is your equipment secure?
- Yes, it's secure.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.663
Sound is the enemy on a submarine,
Mr. Bruni.

19:22.830 --> 19:25.582
The Americans have superior sonar.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.918
They don't need any more help from us.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.110
- Who is it?
- Alex.

19:53.944 --> 19:57.030
Come on in.

20:11.545 --> 20:15.340
Our replacements
have no personal records.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.093
Names, ranks, that's it.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.179
Except for Bavenod, the navigator.

20:21.972 --> 20:25.058
He was on the K-27 when she had
the reactor coolant leak.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.768
Yeah, I know the K-27.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.730
Did you know that he's listed
among the dead?

20:29.897 --> 20:32.524
More precision
from Squadron Command.

20:32.691 --> 20:36.111
I've heard they'll shoot people
just to keep their paperwork straight.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.697
Sailors are superstitious.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.115
It's easy to spook a boat.

20:40.282 --> 20:44.328
Well, Bavenod better not
tell anyone he's dead, then.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.373
Here's to ya.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.259
What's on your mind?

21:00.844 --> 21:04.222
I think our technicians
are OSNAZ commandos.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.100
Yeah, it looks that way.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.102
OSNAZ are KGB radicals.

21:09.269 --> 21:13.440
True believers and trained assassins,
among other things.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.817
Which is why I don't want any
of our crew getting between them

21:15.984 --> 21:17.624
and whatever the hell
it is they're doing.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.571
Yeah.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.115
Once we're deep,
we're gonna drill.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.326
Because I don't want to find out
we have a boat full of nuggets

21:24.493 --> 21:26.536
in the middle of an emergency.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.539
- Aye, sir. I'll see to it.
- All right.

21:48.684 --> 21:51.895
Angle on bow, port 35.

21:53.230 --> 21:57.234
It's about 30 degrees...
Water pressure seems...

21:57.401 --> 21:58.735
Sir.

21:59.403 --> 22:01.154
Two degree up angle.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.324
Captain on deck.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.870
Captain has the con.

22:17.379 --> 22:20.257
Sonar, one active ping
for ranging, on my mark.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.134
Standing by,
Captain. One ping for range.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.846
With sound being the enemy, won't that
alert the Americans to our position?

22:28.098 --> 22:30.098
- Americans already know our position.
- Captain...

22:30.100 --> 22:32.060
I'd just like to avoid
running into them.

22:32.227 --> 22:34.563
Forward and after torpedo,
load, signal ejectors.

22:34.730 --> 22:38.066
- Stand by to launch countermeasures.
- Aye, sir. Standing by.

22:41.069 --> 22:45.365
- Countermeasures loaded.
- Sonar, one ping for range. Mark.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.583
Con, sonar. Submerged contact,

22:54.750 --> 22:58.462
bearing zero-six-zero,
12,000 meters at 30 knots.

22:58.628 --> 23:00.964
Must be a Skipjack fast attack.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.425
Americans, always with
their snouts in the trough.

23:06.386 --> 23:10.307
All ahead one-third,
left full rudder, emergency deep.

23:10.474 --> 23:13.393
Make your depth 160 meters. Report
when we've reached the thermocline.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.438
Emergency dive. Twenty degrees down
on the forward dive planes.

23:16.605 --> 23:18.482
Emergency dive...

23:24.404 --> 23:26.573
Release countermeasures.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.409
- Countermeasures, aye.
- Firing.

23:40.337 --> 23:43.381
Noisemakers blind the Americans,
but they blind us, too.

23:44.508 --> 23:47.344
Captain, entering the thermocline.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.681
The temperature inversion
reflects American sonar,

23:51.848 --> 23:54.309
- so they won't be able to hear us.
- Won't they follow us?

23:54.476 --> 23:56.561
They'll pick a bearing and make a guess.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.356
Their chances are one in 360.

23:59.523 --> 24:01.399
Old submariner trick.

24:02.526 --> 24:04.361
Your father was Nikolai Zubov.

24:04.528 --> 24:07.781
Commanded the 1st Submarine
Brigade of the Baltic Fleet.

24:10.534 --> 24:11.701
That's right.

24:11.868 --> 24:15.205
- Make your heading one-seven-five.
- One-seven-five. Aye, sir.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.291
This man's father wrote
the book on submarine warfare.

24:19.543 --> 24:20.823
- One-seven-five.
- The legacy of

24:20.961 --> 24:23.321
the captain's family is very
well known throughout the Navy.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.549
Awarded a "Hero of the Soviet Union"
for sinking

24:25.715 --> 24:28.426
the Kriegsmarine ship, Goya,
during the war. Do I have that right?

24:28.593 --> 24:31.054
Gentlemen,
we're in the middle of operations.

24:31.221 --> 24:33.598
He was decorated, yeah.

24:33.765 --> 24:37.018
Sent 6,000 miserable Wehrmacht
and Nazi sympathizers

24:37.185 --> 24:39.187
to the bottom of Gdafisk Bay.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.399
If the acorn doesn't
fall too far from the tree,

24:42.566 --> 24:46.236
our captain should be able
to dodge a Yank sub or two.

24:46.736 --> 24:51.491
Port and starboard motors, all stop.
Silent motor ahead, standard.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.785
- Port and starboard motors stop.
- Make your course one-two-zero.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.413
- Silent motor ahead.
- One-two-zero. Aye, sir.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.759
From Squadron Commander
Vladimir Markov:

25:09.926 --> 25:15.098
"To the crew of B-67: Proceed south
to patrol box Lima-Foxtrot"

25:15.265 --> 25:16.933
and monitor American Naval activities.

25:17.100 --> 25:22.230
When conditions permit, commence
system testing of classified equipment

25:22.397 --> 25:26.610
for operational readiness,
maintaining alert status.

25:26.776 --> 25:30.113
"Returning to Rybachiy
on or about June 6th."

25:30.280 --> 25:33.658
This is the executive officer.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.372
Greg, you may post the orders
in the enlisted men's mess.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.999
Aye, sir.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.713
What conditions?

25:48.548 --> 25:51.051
Simulate hydrogen leak,
battery compartment one.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.138
Hydrogen leak, battery deck one.
This is a drill.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.180
Simulate flooding in compartments
13 and 14.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.307
Flooding in compartments 13 and 14.

25:57.474 --> 25:59.309
- This is a drill.
- Let's move it, gentlemen!

25:59.476 --> 26:00.977
- Aye, sir.
- Flooding in 13 and 14!

26:01.144 --> 26:02.479
Let's go, let's go!

26:07.651 --> 26:08.652
Move it, move it!

26:08.818 --> 26:10.320
Come on, gear up! Come on!

26:10.487 --> 26:11.488
All right, there you go.

26:11.655 --> 26:12.656
All right, gear up.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.741
Come to periscope depth,
raise the snorkel,

26:14.908 --> 26:17.661
- prepare to ventilate the boat.
- Aye, sir. Prepare to ventilate.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.120
Let's go, raise the snorkel.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.174
What's wrong?

26:31.341 --> 26:35.512
Saltwater and electrolyte
in the batteries makes chlorine gas.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.473
We're dead already.
We just don't know it.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.684
Con, surface contact, 11,000 meters,

26:40.850 --> 26:42.978
bearing one-nine-five.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.604
Very well. Classification?

26:44.771 --> 26:47.482
Big and slow. Probably a merchant.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.360
- Five degree left rudder.
- Five degree left rudder.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.237
Five degree left rudder.

26:53.738 --> 26:55.407
Stop the drill, Captain.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.096
- Why?
- Because our orders require us

26:58.201 --> 27:00.362
to take tactical advantage
of the testing opportunities

27:00.453 --> 27:01.973
for the classified on board equipment.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.541
Captain, I need you
to put us under that ship.

27:04.708 --> 27:08.461
- We have men below.
- Then you should get them out.

27:09.379 --> 27:11.059
Con, we have
a problem in battery deck two.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.841
Yeah, what is it?

27:13.008 --> 27:15.844
Not sure, sir.
The men are coming up now.

27:17.554 --> 27:20.181
- Mr. Kozlov, terminate the drill.
- Aye, sir.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.100
- All hands, terminate drill.
- Captain.

27:22.267 --> 27:24.394
- What?
- Put us under that ship.

27:24.561 --> 27:28.773
Sir... we don't know who that is.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.655
Mr. Bavenod,
plot an intercept for that ship.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.575
- Put the moon on our stern.
- Aye, Captain.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.952
- Sir...
- Level the boat.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.038
Make our depth ten meters.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.708
- Level the boat, depth ten meters.
- Aye, aye, level the boat.

27:46.875 --> 27:47.917
- Ten meters.
- We'll take a look

27:48.084 --> 27:50.503
before we get any closer.

27:51.087 --> 27:53.423
If that's all right with you.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.557
Panamanian flag.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.103
- Tanker.
- Good. She can't shoot at us then.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.855
No, but she can report our position.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.623
Put us beneath her keel.
You can do that.

28:10.774 --> 28:13.943
The noise from her screws
will blind us, Captain.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.287
Engineer, time on the batteries?

28:24.454 --> 28:27.707
At current speed,
30, 35 minutes, Captain.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.210
All full ahead.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.004
Make your depth 30 meters.

28:33.171 --> 28:35.882
- Put us in her wake.
- Aye, sir.

28:36.049 --> 28:39.135
- Ahead full, 30 meters.
- Ahead full, 30 meters.

28:39.302 --> 28:40.470
Thirty meters.

28:54.109 --> 28:55.944
Sixty meters.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.362
Closing at two knots.

29:05.829 --> 29:08.081
Con, sonar.
We're in her acoustic shadow.

29:08.248 --> 29:11.334
Too much cavitation.
We need to get higher.

29:13.837 --> 29:15.463
Captain?

29:17.674 --> 29:22.220
Officer of the deck,
gently make our depth ten meters.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.142
One degree up bubble.
Depth ten meters.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.185
One degree up bubble, ten meters.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.616
- Ten meters.
- Higher, Captain.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.202
- Those are 20-ton screws.
- Higher, Captain.

29:46.369 --> 29:48.496
Engineer, time on the batteries?

29:50.707 --> 29:52.959
Ten minutes, more or less.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.502
Higher!

29:54.669 --> 29:55.879
If you please.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.547
We're already rolling, Captain.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.633
Fluid dynamics, Mr. Kozlov.
We're both in the same plane of motion.

30:03.178 --> 30:06.306
One degree up bubble.
Very gently.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.683
- Make your depth five meters.
- Come to five meters.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.853
One degree up bubble.
Maybe you'd like to tell us

30:12.020 --> 30:14.100
- what we're risking 86 lives for?
- Hey, hey, hey...

30:14.147 --> 30:16.441
For our patriotic duty, Mr. Kozlov.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.532
Come on. Come on!

30:27.368 --> 30:30.079
Con, maneuvering.
We're losing main battery power.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.165
Reduce all engines 40 percent.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.167
Make turns for five knots.

30:34.334 --> 30:36.336
Stand by, all diesels.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.381
- Diesels online.
- Brace for impact.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.675
Brace for impact!

30:56.940 --> 30:58.700
- Stand by.
- Get down there and take a look!

30:58.733 --> 31:00.318
I want a damage report.

31:00.485 --> 31:02.070
- Raise the snorkel.
- Engine room,

31:02.237 --> 31:04.155
- give me a damage report!
- All start diesels.

31:05.240 --> 31:09.661
Aye, sir. All start on diesels.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.413
Will that be it for a while, Mr. Bruni?

31:15.625 --> 31:17.001
Yes.

31:17.961 --> 31:21.297
Mr. Kozlov has the con.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.776
Always the rebel, Demi.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.945
I mean, don't you think that vodka
would be more in keeping

31:44.112 --> 31:46.072
with a servant of the Soviet Navy?

31:46.239 --> 31:50.201
Rum's a sailor's drink.
Vodka, a politician's.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.662
One serves the other,
don't you think?

31:52.829 --> 31:54.998
Politics serves itself.

31:56.332 --> 32:00.670
I mean, no offense, but...
I drink what I like.

32:09.679 --> 32:10.680
Try some.

32:11.806 --> 32:13.099
Good for ya.

32:18.313 --> 32:21.149
How is it, after all this time,
you and I end up on a boat

32:21.316 --> 32:23.151
older than most of the men sailing her?

32:23.318 --> 32:26.321
Well, this boat is reprisal

32:26.487 --> 32:29.324
for the benefit of Squadron Commander
Markov's amusement.

32:29.490 --> 32:30.742
Reprisal for what?

32:30.908 --> 32:35.580
The "what" is well understood
by the Admiral and myself.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.583
What was her name?

32:39.500 --> 32:43.087
Sophi. I married her.

32:46.591 --> 32:49.010
That was superb sailing.

32:49.844 --> 32:52.430
But I'm not sure Alex
would have made the same call.

32:52.597 --> 32:55.558
Well, some younger officers...

32:56.976 --> 32:59.687
aren't comfortable
working near the margins.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.650
He needs to be more careful
around the OSNAZ.

33:03.816 --> 33:06.537
They have connections that could
just as easily land him in the gulag

33:06.653 --> 33:08.196
as on his own submarine.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.448
We risked our lives
without knowing why.

33:10.615 --> 33:12.075
He's entitled to his opinion.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.911
Opinions are antithetical
for a clear chain of command.

33:15.078 --> 33:17.580
I'll remind you of that
the next time you have one.

33:17.747 --> 33:20.917
You didn't like Bruni's orders either.
That confuses me.

33:21.084 --> 33:23.670
Following orders confuses you?

33:23.836 --> 33:26.881
You not questioning them
confuses me.

33:27.048 --> 33:30.093
Well, like you say,
one must take care around OSNAZ.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.679
An instinct worth sharing
with your executive officer.

33:32.845 --> 33:35.264
Which I'm sure you'll do
at the first opportunity.

33:39.560 --> 33:44.190
This boat is an outrage, especially
for a man with your record of service.

33:44.357 --> 33:46.484
Markov must have offered you something.

33:47.819 --> 33:51.447
You know what they call an
old boat captain without a boat?

33:53.074 --> 33:54.992
"Just another drunk."

33:56.411 --> 34:01.457
Markov offered me the only
command left in a shrinking navy.

34:01.624 --> 34:04.335
Pathetic as that
may sound to you...

34:05.753 --> 34:07.296
I took it.

34:33.156 --> 34:35.908
- Do you think we can...
- Wake up.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.827
- Where are my men?
- Wake up.

34:37.994 --> 34:40.788
- If you have so many questions...
- Why are they doing this?

34:40.955 --> 34:44.500
- I said where are my men?
- You were gone again.

34:44.667 --> 34:47.670
- They're where you left them.
- And again.

34:47.837 --> 34:52.341
- I was dreaming about you.
- I'm sorry, Sophi.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.890
Hey... Hey, I'm here. I'm here.

34:59.056 --> 35:02.518
I'm here. I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right.

35:03.436 --> 35:04.771
All right, all right.

35:04.937 --> 35:08.566
All right. All right. OK.

35:13.070 --> 35:16.365
There you go. Yeah. You're OK.

35:16.532 --> 35:19.118
- He just collapsed.
- It's all right.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.037
What's wrong with him?

35:23.122 --> 35:25.666
- He's epileptic.
- He's epileptic?

35:25.833 --> 35:29.921
Yes, from a brain trauma years ago.
Only happens once or twice a year.

35:31.464 --> 35:34.383
Yeah, help me get him to his bunk.

35:34.550 --> 35:36.135
- There we go.
- There you go.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.720
- You got him?
- Yeah.

35:38.221 --> 35:41.390
His medication,
this government stuff, is shit.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.771
Demi... I'll be in the con.

35:47.730 --> 35:48.981
I got him.

36:03.955 --> 36:05.790
Shit.

36:07.166 --> 36:10.711
You're all right. OK?
Just relax.

36:21.097 --> 36:22.390
Melville?

36:25.101 --> 36:27.645
The white whale.

36:31.941 --> 36:37.113
Sometimes I have dreams so clear...

36:38.739 --> 36:41.617
I can't tell them from what's real.

36:44.412 --> 36:49.417
They beckon... like Ahab.

36:50.877 --> 36:53.671
It's not uncommon with a brain injury.

36:57.466 --> 37:00.595
There are times I feel
I'm losing my mind.

37:20.865 --> 37:21.949
Alex.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.710
If it gets back to the party
that we knew about his condition...

37:33.461 --> 37:36.631
we could be spending the rest
of our careers scraping paint.

37:40.009 --> 37:42.011
I'm not gonna tell 'em.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.973
Con, sonar.

37:47.642 --> 37:49.435
Sonar, con. Go ahead.

37:50.186 --> 37:52.229
We have a contact.
Three thousand meters.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.607
On my way.
Secure port and starboard motors.

37:54.774 --> 37:56.975
Make turns on the propellers
for three knots. Excuse me.

37:57.109 --> 38:00.529
- Rig for silent running.
- Aye. Secure for silent running.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.786
You realize this is
supposed to be your patrol.

38:06.953 --> 38:09.330
If it was supposed to be mine,
I'd be the captain.

38:09.497 --> 38:11.207
Well, as far as we know,
the party already knows about this

38:11.374 --> 38:13.334
and wants to see how
you perform under pressure.

38:13.501 --> 38:14.710
How am I doing?

38:14.877 --> 38:18.422
- That man has a nuclear firing key.
- And you and I have the other two.

38:18.589 --> 38:19.882
Captain Kozlov...

38:20.049 --> 38:22.677
If you're ready to relieve
the commanding officer

38:22.843 --> 38:24.720
of a Soviet ballistic missile submarine,

38:24.887 --> 38:28.265
your captain and your friend
because he fainted...

38:29.308 --> 38:30.768
then you go right ahead.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.396
I'll be in sonar.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.902
It's a Skipjack, sir.

38:40.069 --> 38:41.829
And he's going someplace
in a big damn hurry.

38:41.946 --> 38:44.031
- Have they seen us yet?
- I don't think so.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.826
She's moving too fast to hear anybody,
that's for sure.

38:46.993 --> 38:48.828
All right.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.423
Why are we slowing?

39:00.589 --> 39:02.258
We've had contact
with an American sub.

39:02.425 --> 39:04.510
Tommy, come right full rudder.

39:04.677 --> 39:07.096
Aye, sir. Right full rudder.

39:07.263 --> 39:09.640
Surface the ship
and start the diesel engines.

39:11.851 --> 39:13.853
- Why would I do that?
- Yeah.

39:15.229 --> 39:18.107
- Why would he do that?
- Captain on deck.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.906
Sonar, con.
Has the American changed course?

39:27.199 --> 39:29.785
- <i>No, sir. He's holding steady.</i>
<i>- Very well. Keep me posted.</i>

39:31.746 --> 39:34.749
Captain, I need you to snorkel
the ship and start the engines.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.650
If we start the engines,
the Americans will know our position

39:38.794 --> 39:40.296
and our mission will be compromised.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.631
That presumes you know
what our mission is.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.218
Maybe you'd like to let us in on it.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.225
- Are we ready?
- We're ready, sir.

39:54.810 --> 39:57.104
A little faith, Captain.

39:58.981 --> 40:01.067
Officer of the deck,
make our depth ten meters.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.944
- Aye, Captain. Ten meters.
- Ten meters, aye.

40:04.111 --> 40:07.281
- How long was I out?
- About six hours.

40:10.451 --> 40:12.203
The Americans have acoustic signatures

40:12.369 --> 40:14.330
for all submarines
and ships in our fleet.

40:14.497 --> 40:17.208
They'll be able to identify us.

40:17.792 --> 40:19.001
I understand.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.338
Engineer, raise the snorkel.

40:22.505 --> 40:26.759
Start port and starboard diesels
and make turns for six knots.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.852
Engage the Phantom.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.369
Phantom's engaged, sir.

40:56.413 --> 40:57.998
What the hell are we doing?

40:58.165 --> 41:00.376
Son of a...

41:00.543 --> 41:03.295
Con, sonar.
American is turning to intercept.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.590
- Battle stations.
- Battle stations. Aye.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.386
Rig for battle stations.
This is not a drill.

41:10.553 --> 41:12.888
Rear torpedo,
stand by on tubes five and six.

41:15.391 --> 41:17.393
- Move it!
- Go, go, go, go!

41:18.561 --> 41:20.062
Loaded!

41:21.063 --> 41:23.315
Sonar, con.
What's that ship doing?

41:23.482 --> 41:25.922
- She's falling in behind us, sir.
- Has she opened her doors?

41:26.068 --> 41:27.278
Not yet, sir.

41:27.444 --> 41:29.155
You ever start a war, Mr. Bruni?

41:29.321 --> 41:32.533
Because if she even blinks,
I'm gonna put a fish into her.

41:38.164 --> 41:40.916
Any R.O.E. I need to know about
before I sink this son-of-a-bitch?

41:41.083 --> 41:44.628
- That's "Rules of Engagement."
- I know what an R.O.E. is.

41:44.795 --> 41:47.298
Any hostile action may be met
with force at your discretion.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.091
At least we agree it's hostile.

41:49.258 --> 41:52.428
- Stand by to fire.
- Standing by, Captain.

42:06.358 --> 42:10.446
Con, sonar.
The enemy's changing course.

42:10.613 --> 42:11.864
What's their heading?

42:12.031 --> 42:14.575
They're heading back
on their original track, sir.

42:30.174 --> 42:32.301
It's a cloaking device?

42:34.136 --> 42:36.805
You understand this
is completely classified.

42:37.890 --> 42:41.018
So the Americans thought they were
following the Panamanian tanker.

42:41.185 --> 42:42.144
Yes.

42:42.311 --> 42:44.563
We've turned their own
technology against them.

42:44.730 --> 42:45.814
Perfect countermeasure.

42:45.981 --> 42:48.442
Any ship equipped
with the device becomes a phantom.

42:48.609 --> 42:52.571
Soon, we'll have acoustic signatures
from ships all over the world.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.281
The Americans will run in circles.

42:54.448 --> 42:56.492
Our engines were running.

42:57.159 --> 42:58.702
We were making noise too.

42:58.869 --> 43:00.663
Besides,
the strength of a sonar echo is

43:00.829 --> 43:03.165
directly proportional
to the size of a ship.

43:03.332 --> 43:06.335
And we're not exactly a freighter.

43:06.502 --> 43:10.547
The Phantom magnifies the echo,
making us appear any size we want.

43:10.714 --> 43:14.343
The genius of the algorithm is how
it makes us invisible to active sonar

43:14.510 --> 43:17.346
and enables us to mask ourselves
as any ship we like.

43:17.513 --> 43:18.681
We should all be very proud

43:18.847 --> 43:21.267
of what we've accomplished
here today, gentlemen.

43:22.434 --> 43:23.978
To the Phantom.

43:29.441 --> 43:33.279
I'm sure Squadron Command will be
pleased that the device is operational.

43:34.029 --> 43:35.656
Of course.

43:35.823 --> 43:37.866
As protocol dictates,
we'll send word to Fleet

43:38.033 --> 43:40.202
as soon as we reach
our reporting point.

43:40.369 --> 43:44.999
Protocol is the political officer's
purview, would you agree, Mr. Pavlov?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.752
I agree that Fleet will be pleased.

43:48.919 --> 43:52.715
Mr. Pavlov is one of the most diplomatic
political officers in the Navy.

43:52.881 --> 43:56.302
- A contradiction in terms.
- That's what I keep trying to tell him.

43:56.468 --> 44:01.265
I assure you that my intentions are
purely that of the State and the party.

44:04.059 --> 44:05.894
Well, thank goodness.

44:06.395 --> 44:09.273
As you might imagine,
we have quite a bit of data to analyze.

44:09.440 --> 44:14.111
Thank you, Captain, gentlemen,
for the fine meal and the company.

44:14.737 --> 44:16.613
Captain.

44:22.828 --> 44:24.580
Mr. Bavenod,
I'm gonna need an update

44:24.747 --> 44:27.750
on the arrival time
at the reporting point.

44:27.916 --> 44:30.377
Aye, Captain. Excuse me.

44:30.919 --> 44:32.212
Excuse me.

44:49.271 --> 44:51.315
If you'll excuse me as well, gentlemen.

44:52.608 --> 44:54.777
I think I'll retire for the evening.

44:55.694 --> 44:57.112
Good night, Sasha.

45:03.577 --> 45:06.455
I suppose you think it's sporting
to embarrass me in front of the KGB.

45:06.622 --> 45:08.415
It wasn't personal, Greg.

45:09.333 --> 45:11.043
Why did you feel the need to say so?

45:11.210 --> 45:15.089
You give me a direct answer and I
won't have to guess at what you mean.

45:15.964 --> 45:16.924
What was the question?

45:17.091 --> 45:19.635
If you agree we should report to Fleet.

45:21.762 --> 45:23.931
What are you worried about?

45:24.098 --> 45:25.933
This is an historic moment.

45:26.475 --> 45:30.687
Well, nonetheless, as officers of a ship
that could trigger the end of the world,

45:30.854 --> 45:33.315
I think we should
consider all scenarios.

45:34.400 --> 45:36.026
What scenarios?

45:36.193 --> 45:40.239
If the Americans can't track us
with all their money and technology...

45:41.156 --> 45:43.117
then our boats can't track us either.

45:43.826 --> 45:47.371
It means it wouldn't be hard
to alter the purpose of this ship.

45:48.831 --> 45:51.667
So you're saying they're
some rogue Spetsnaz force?

45:51.834 --> 45:55.504
I'm saying a message from Fleet
would answer a lot of questions.

46:00.217 --> 46:02.886
Well, as political officer on this boat
and as your friend,

46:03.053 --> 46:08.350
it's my duty to tell you that if
you even imply treasonous intent

46:08.517 --> 46:12.187
of elite KGB officers
without proper evidence or cause,

46:12.354 --> 46:14.106
you'll be put up
for charges of misconduct

46:14.273 --> 46:15.691
of the Code of Military Justice.

46:15.858 --> 46:18.527
Sometimes a man
has to pick a side, Greg.

46:20.154 --> 46:22.614
Well then, you should pick wisely.

46:22.781 --> 46:24.575
'Cause if you're wrong...

46:25.284 --> 46:28.162
this will haunt you
and your families...

46:29.830 --> 46:31.748
for the rest of your lives.

46:31.915 --> 46:34.168
And it won't matter who your father is.

46:41.675 --> 46:45.637
Well, that was uncalled for.

46:46.472 --> 46:50.142
It's not his fault.
He was trained to fear everything.

46:50.309 --> 46:52.644
Still, I think we
should take him at his word.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.646
How so?

46:54.813 --> 46:58.734
OSNAZ don't work for the military
or the central government.

47:00.152 --> 47:04.364
Their orders come from
the most zealous elements of the KGB.

47:05.073 --> 47:07.367
They can destroy you, Demi.

47:09.495 --> 47:11.622
They can destroy all of us.

47:54.122 --> 47:56.291
Captain, we've reached
the reporting point.

47:56.458 --> 47:59.503
All right.
Helm, make your depth ten meters.

47:59.670 --> 48:01.505
Aye, Captain. Ten meters.

48:04.508 --> 48:07.886
Radio, con.
Prepare to send microburst transmission.

48:08.053 --> 48:10.556
Our orders are to proceed
to our patrol box.

48:13.350 --> 48:15.477
Well, as soon as we make
our position report

48:15.644 --> 48:17.980
and confirm our orders,
we'll do that.

48:18.146 --> 48:20.941
Sending a transmission will
alert the Americans of our position.

48:21.108 --> 48:23.402
- Fifty meters.
- Continue.

48:24.736 --> 48:26.488
You can turn your gadget on
and we can run away again.

48:26.655 --> 48:28.073
We seem to be pretty good at that.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.158
The Phantom device
can't mask a radio broadcast.

48:30.325 --> 48:32.077
Our mission objectives
would be compromised.

48:32.244 --> 48:36.164
- What are our mission objectives?
- To remain undetected, of course.

48:36.331 --> 48:39.209
We have countermeasures,
procedures to ensure our stealth.

48:39.376 --> 48:40.627
- Thirty meters, Captain.
- Continue.

48:40.794 --> 48:42.170
That is an unacceptable risk.

48:42.337 --> 48:46.258
Protocol dictates encrypted progress
transmissions are sent to Fleet Command

48:46.425 --> 48:47.968
at predetermined waypoints.

48:48.135 --> 48:49.511
- Are you saying something to me?
- You have authority

48:49.678 --> 48:52.222
to make status reports
at your discretion.

48:52.389 --> 48:56.143
In time of war, yes, I do.

48:58.228 --> 48:59.354
You know something I don't?

48:59.521 --> 49:01.148
- Twenty meters.
- Stop the ascent.

49:01.315 --> 49:02.357
- Continue.
- Stop the ascent, Captain!

49:02.524 --> 49:04.151
Mr. Pavlov, if you contradict me again,

49:04.318 --> 49:05.694
I'll have you chained
to the forward head.

49:05.861 --> 49:08.530
- Ten meters.
- Stand by for microburst transmission.

49:08.697 --> 49:10.498
- Standing by.
- I can't allow you to do that.

49:10.574 --> 49:14.286
Officer of the deck, escort Mr. Bruni
to his cabin and lock him to his bunk.

49:14.453 --> 49:15.787
Aye, sir.

49:16.330 --> 49:19.082
Somebody dive the boat
or I'll shoot the captain.

49:30.218 --> 49:33.388
Dive the boat.
Bow planes 20 degrees down.

49:33.555 --> 49:35.015
- Aye, sir.
- Gentlemen,

49:35.182 --> 49:36.475
I'm sure if we let the Captain think...

49:36.642 --> 49:38.810
I don't have anything to think over.

49:40.437 --> 49:44.399
Dmitri Zubov is an epileptic
who uses drugs and drink

49:44.566 --> 49:46.902
to medicate his neurological malady.

49:47.069 --> 49:48.820
The result of a brain injury
he sustained

49:48.987 --> 49:51.740
when he collided
with Vladimir Markov's boat...

49:52.658 --> 49:53.950
killing how many sailors?

49:54.117 --> 49:57.162
Thirty-six injured. Six lost souls.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.706
All on this very ship.

50:00.832 --> 50:03.085
You also boast one of the
lowest scores to ever come out

50:03.251 --> 50:04.961
of the Officers Training School.

50:06.755 --> 50:09.049
Well, you don't deny it, anyway.

50:09.216 --> 50:13.095
The real mystery is how you were never
run out of the Navy altogether.

50:13.261 --> 50:16.264
And I'm sure you're
going to tell us why.

50:16.431 --> 50:20.018
Pedigree, influence and advanced skills
in bribing duty officers,

50:20.185 --> 50:22.604
- ship surgeons and political officers.
- That's a lie.

50:22.771 --> 50:27.275
So much shame, you tried to take your
own life, but even at this you failed.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.195
But I'm sure you knew all that.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.700
No, actually I didn't.

50:35.951 --> 50:39.454
Those of you who wish to remain
in the service of your country

50:39.621 --> 50:41.873
may stand your posts.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.960
Those who do not may join
your captain in a court martial.

50:46.962 --> 50:49.297
What about you, Mr. First Officer?

50:49.464 --> 50:53.552
Your loyalty in exchange for a hero's
welcome home and your first command?

50:59.391 --> 51:01.518
Separate them, fore and aft.

51:03.645 --> 51:05.814
Last chance, Captain.

51:05.981 --> 51:08.817
Compliance for a grateful nation.

51:10.152 --> 51:12.654
There's a Ukrainian proverb that says:

51:12.821 --> 51:16.450
"Share a tent with Gypsies,
and you wake up in a field of shit."

51:16.616 --> 51:18.243
I've heard that one, yes.

51:18.410 --> 51:21.538
Then you'll understand if I tell you
to go fuck yourself.

51:33.925 --> 51:35.927
Captain!

51:36.178 --> 51:38.805
- Back up! Back up!
- OK.

51:38.972 --> 51:40.932
- Easy, easy.
- Take it easy.

51:41.099 --> 51:42.934
- Easy...
- What is this?

51:44.269 --> 51:46.229
- Step aside.
- Watch yourself, OK?

52:06.291 --> 52:08.710
"To defeat an adversary..."

52:10.045 --> 52:14.049
you must always drive the fight,

52:14.216 --> 52:18.345
"be willing to do
that which is never expected."

52:24.226 --> 52:25.560
We've all read his book.

52:25.727 --> 52:28.063
My father had ambitions for me.

52:28.230 --> 52:30.315
So did the party.

52:31.691 --> 52:34.569
I was in a hunter-killer exercise
with Markov.

52:34.736 --> 52:39.115
Command was sizing us up
for bigger things,

52:39.282 --> 52:42.410
and I had so much to prove.

52:42.577 --> 52:48.250
I knew Markov would never
expect me to fight in the blind,

52:48.416 --> 52:51.920
so I pulled into his wake.

52:52.921 --> 52:56.216
But I never expected him
to reverse his engines, either.

52:58.260 --> 53:01.847
During the collision,
I smashed my head into the gyro.

53:02.013 --> 53:05.934
When I came around, there was
a fire in the forward torpedo.

53:08.770 --> 53:11.022
The men fighting it wouldn't...

53:15.360 --> 53:17.487
they wouldn't come out.

53:17.654 --> 53:19.447
They refused.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.868
So I was...

53:25.287 --> 53:28.540
I was forced to seal them inside.

53:34.838 --> 53:39.467
Eventually they just let the tubes open
and let the sea rush in.

53:40.427 --> 53:43.930
Better to drown than burn, I guess.

54:01.615 --> 54:04.576
That should've been
the end of our careers, but...

54:05.619 --> 54:10.165
command would not allow
my father to be shamed by me.

54:11.750 --> 54:15.962
We never faced the families,
we never faced ourselves.

54:16.755 --> 54:18.632
We were just quietly passed over,

54:18.798 --> 54:21.676
exiled out here
so we wouldn't embarrass anybody.

54:27.974 --> 54:31.728
Command would never

54:31.895 --> 54:33.939
put something as important
as the Phantom

54:34.105 --> 54:36.775
in the hands of someone like me.

54:43.198 --> 54:47.911
There are only two reasons
why a boat would go rogue.

54:49.371 --> 54:53.500
One is to defect,
and the other it to start a war.

54:54.501 --> 54:56.419
And I don't think we're defecting.

55:11.726 --> 55:14.229
- Yeah.
- We need to disable the warhead.

55:14.396 --> 55:17.315
- They can't launch without the codes.
- They have the codes.

55:17.482 --> 55:19.067
I'm sure of it.

55:20.235 --> 55:21.955
We can navigate the ship
through the bilges.

55:22.070 --> 55:25.448
- Is Tyrtov with you?
- He's right here.

55:25.615 --> 55:28.076
He knows that warhead
better than anybody.

55:28.576 --> 55:31.079
- Can you rig a transmitter?
- Aye, Captain.

55:31.246 --> 55:32.539
Quietly.

55:33.289 --> 55:35.417
Listen, if we can rearrange
the firing triggers,

55:35.583 --> 55:38.503
we should be able to create
a single-point detonation.

55:38.670 --> 55:42.215
It'll still launch,
but it won't start a nuclear explosion.

55:42.382 --> 55:43.842
Maybe.

55:44.009 --> 55:47.512
- I can't argue with "maybe."
- It's possible.

55:47.679 --> 55:50.932
This ship's full of OSNAZ.
We need to get to the weapons lock-up.

55:51.099 --> 55:53.340
It'd be best to take back the boat
than to test a theory.

55:53.435 --> 55:55.437
- Can you get below decks?
- We can do that.

55:55.603 --> 55:58.314
Yeah, roger that. Get back to me.

56:01.151 --> 56:03.737
You and Bavenod are going below.

56:33.850 --> 56:36.436
How long?

56:37.562 --> 56:38.980
Six hours.

56:42.817 --> 56:44.178
Helm, let's have a look behind us.

56:44.194 --> 56:47.822
- Left, 45 degrees.
- Left, 45.

56:53.828 --> 56:54.996
Sonar, report.

56:57.999 --> 56:59.000
All clear.

56:59.167 --> 57:02.754
Helm, steer a course for two-seven-four.

57:02.921 --> 57:05.715
Two-seven-four. Aye, sir.

57:12.847 --> 57:16.142
That heading puts us extremely close
to the American fleet.

57:16.935 --> 57:18.436
Correct.

57:35.161 --> 57:37.413
So we have
a saltwater-activated battery.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.833
Now this here will
broadcast our location.

57:39.999 --> 57:41.376
This will tell them

57:41.543 --> 57:42.583
that we've been overtaken.

57:42.710 --> 57:46.548
Demi, if the Americans think we're
rogue, they're gonna try and sink us.

57:46.714 --> 57:49.717
And if we are rogue,
our fleet will do it for them.

57:50.593 --> 57:53.138
That should tell us
everything we need to know.

57:54.389 --> 57:55.557
Why would Bruni do this?

57:55.723 --> 57:58.601
If we launch a nuclear missile,
the Americans are gonna have to respond.

57:58.768 --> 58:03.731
It's a false flag. He'll cloak us as one
of the subs we already sold to Peking.

58:03.898 --> 58:06.401
The Americans will think it was
the Chinese who fired on them.

58:06.568 --> 58:08.570
But we're about to change
all that with this.

58:09.529 --> 58:13.074
Bruni's trying to start the only
kind of nuclear war we can win.

58:13.741 --> 58:15.577
One we're not in.

58:21.541 --> 58:23.042
Shit!

58:25.753 --> 58:28.256
Come on.

58:38.433 --> 58:40.268
Now if we pressurize the breach
right now,

58:40.435 --> 58:42.036
they will definitely hear it in the con.

58:42.187 --> 58:45.190
Now, look.
This is sodium bicarbonate.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.984
Now mix with a little saltwater...

58:48.151 --> 58:49.736
it creates carbon dioxide.

58:49.903 --> 58:53.364
That will pressurize the breach
and it will launch the transmitter.

58:53.531 --> 58:54.574
But quietly.

59:04.167 --> 59:05.793
- We're through.
- Go with Tyrtov.

59:05.960 --> 59:08.254
Do whatever you can
to get to the missile.

59:08.421 --> 59:09.839
- The rest of you?
- Yes, sir.

59:10.006 --> 59:12.717
- Come with me.
- Aye, sir.

01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:03.226
Stow that in here.

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:12.819
Open the hatch.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:29.961
What was that noise?

01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:33.006
I don't know... Captain.

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:35.300
What'd you run us into?

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:38.177
You're in no position to understand
the events unfolding around you.

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:42.056
I understand you've seized
this vessel without authority.

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:45.476
You'd better get up here.

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:49.063
We have a contact bearing down on us
at almost 40 knots.

01:00:50.982 --> 01:00:53.735
- American?
- No. It's one of ours.

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:57.780
If I were you, skipper,
I'd sound battle stations.

01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:02.910
Sound battle stations.
Bring the captain.

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:10.585
Relax.

01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:29.103
Come on, come on!

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:43.576
Captain.

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:46.579
Captain.

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:48.122
Mr. Pavlov.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:49.582
The November's slowing.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:53.711
- It's the K-123.
- That's Constantine Gubin's boat.

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:54.962
You should be flattered.

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:57.799
He's the most decorated
hunter-killer in the fleet.

01:02:16.526 --> 01:02:19.487
Con, sonar. November's
2,000 meters and closing.

01:02:20.822 --> 01:02:22.198
The November's lining up to take a shot.

01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:24.784
Appears our government
doesn't approve of your plan.

01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:29.622
What you do not understand and what our
politicians don't want to accept or face

01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:33.334
is that the Americans have acquired
a first-strike nuclear capability.

01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:37.296
Well, even if that's the case,
what makes you think they'd use it?

01:02:38.423 --> 01:02:39.966
We would.

01:02:43.553 --> 01:02:45.596
- Hey... What?
- No.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:48.516
I can't. I can't go in there.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:50.351
- It's too small.
- Oh, shit.

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:52.728
Jesus Christ, you're claustrophobic?

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:56.023
Can you talk me through it?

01:03:08.286 --> 01:03:11.456
Twenty-five charges
that surround the core.

01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:14.250
The timing of the detonation
has to be perfect

01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:17.545
to start a nuclear reaction.

01:03:17.712 --> 01:03:19.922
It's OK, it's OK.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:24.552
Con, sonar.
The November's closing.

01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:27.722
- Two thousand meters.
- We have to do something, sir.

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:32.018
- You ever been in America?
- No. Have you?

01:03:32.185 --> 01:03:33.644
Yeah, my wife was a dancer.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:36.689
I was allowed to accompany her
to New York City in an arts exchange.

01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:41.819
The November's opening her outer doors.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:44.363
Unless you know some
naval combat tactics, Mr. Bruni,

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:46.616
this situation is gonna to get ugly.

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.535
All right, Captain.
You have the ship.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.332
Sound battle stations.

01:03:54.499 --> 01:03:56.959
Aft torpedoes, prepare countermeasures.

01:03:57.126 --> 01:03:59.629
Load tube seven with a decoy.

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:01.339
This is the captain.

01:04:04.759 --> 01:04:06.219
Start it up!

01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:07.845
Move it, move it, move it!

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.731
Sonar, one active ping for range,
on my mark.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.399
- Aye, Captain.
- What are you doing?

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.777
Letting them know
they're in for a fight.

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:25.905
- Helm, full right rudder.
- Aye, sir.

01:04:26.072 --> 01:04:29.200
Forward torpedo,
prepare tubes one and two.

01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:33.955
- Arm for acoustic homing. Mark.
- Aye, sir.

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:37.458
Two detonating wires
come into contact

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:41.796
with the timing board
through a two-piece connector.

01:04:41.963 --> 01:04:45.383
You have to f-free the locking ring
without disconnecting it.

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:46.509
Go.

01:04:46.676 --> 01:04:47.969
Take“.

01:04:57.311 --> 01:04:59.981
Take that.
Twenty G's of acceleration

01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.440
will turn that four-pound wrench

01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:04.569
into an 80-pound sledge
that will rip the connectors apart

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:07.113
- once it's clear of the boat.
- Then what?

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.574
Then we get a shape-charge detonation

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.243
- and the missile falls into the sea.
- Good.

01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:22.253
- Flood tubes seven, eight and nine.
- I'm curious, Captain.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.381
What did you learn about the enemy
from their dancers and their clowns?

01:05:25.548 --> 01:05:28.301
The Americans value individual life
above everything else.

01:05:28.467 --> 01:05:31.596
They wouldn't tolerate the loss
of even one single city.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:34.223
Con, sonar.
November's 1500 meters and closing.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.726
Ten degrees down bubble.
Make our depth 300 meters.

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:39.770
- Aye, Captain, 300 meters.
- That's below crush depth.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.814
I know what our crush depth is, Pavlov.

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:45.026
- What are we doing?
- Lifting our skirt.

01:05:52.533 --> 01:05:56.245
Con, sonar.
Two fish in the water, 1,000 meters.

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:02.668
You can shoot me now
and I'll see you in hell...

01:06:02.877 --> 01:06:04.503
in about 90 seconds.

01:06:11.552 --> 01:06:14.680
It's gonna set off
an alert on the control panel.

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:16.641
There's nothing we can do about that.

01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:20.186
You gotta understand...

01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:25.650
if the connector comes apart...
before ignition,

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:29.445
the fail-safe is gonna
detonate the missile in the tube.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.073
Yeah.

01:06:39.038 --> 01:06:42.750
Open the door to tube seven
and stand by to fire the decoy.

01:06:58.307 --> 01:07:00.227
Maybe now would be
a good time for you to tell me

01:07:00.267 --> 01:07:03.104
just what the hell
it is we're doing, Mr. Bruni.

01:07:05.106 --> 01:07:08.109
Have you heard of an American
program called Dark Star?

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:10.611
It's a fully synchronized system

01:07:10.778 --> 01:07:12.947
of endoatmospheric
antiballistic missiles,

01:07:13.114 --> 01:07:14.740
guided by a highly accurate radar.

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:16.909
Torpedo, 700 meters.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.411
- Copy that.
- If the Americans

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:20.788
launch a first strike,
all our land-based missiles

01:07:20.955 --> 01:07:22.915
would be taken out
even before they can be fueled.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.417
That's why we have
submarines and bombers.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.085
That's why they developed Dark Star.

01:07:26.252 --> 01:07:27.972
It's a radar array
that guides and detonates

01:07:28.129 --> 01:07:29.588
atomic missiles in the ionosphere.

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.799
- An electromagnetic pulse weapon.
- Yes.

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:34.635
It'll take down everything our surviving
submarines and aircraft can get up.

01:07:34.802 --> 01:07:36.679
They've tested it
and it's fully operational.

01:07:36.846 --> 01:07:39.181
Not a single American city would be hit.

01:07:39.348 --> 01:07:44.103
If there's no consequences for attacking
us, what's their incentive for peace?

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.356
There is none.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:50.735
Torpedoes, 500 meters!

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:53.070
- Release all countermeasures.
- Aye, Captain.

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.533
- Fire the decoy.
- Firing decoy.

01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:02.413
Emergency dive. Full right rudder.

01:08:15.176 --> 01:08:16.635
Brace for impact!

01:08:42.745 --> 01:08:46.499
Con, sonar. One of them got through,
bearing two-six-five.

01:08:56.425 --> 01:08:58.511
It missed! It missed!

01:08:58.676 --> 01:08:59.886
Helm, take us deeper.

01:09:00.054 --> 01:09:03.140
Let me know when we have a temperature
differential of ten degrees.

01:09:07.895 --> 01:09:09.729
Approaching crush depth, Captain.

01:09:18.906 --> 01:09:19.907
It's breaking her up!

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.367
Three hundred and sixty meters.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.573
- Entering the thermocline.
- Do something, Captain!

01:09:23.911 --> 01:09:25.496
- Captain!
- Pavlov!

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.331
Level bow plane.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.167
Forward torpedo,
flood doors one and two.

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:33.087
- Stop all engines.
- Stop all engines. Aye, sir.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.720
Sonar, con. Where's the November?

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:45.015
She's right on top of us, sir.

01:09:56.277 --> 01:09:57.695
Now what?

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:01.156
We wait.

01:10:14.712 --> 01:10:18.132
The Americans do have
an incentive for peace.

01:10:18.299 --> 01:10:22.094
- What would that be?
- Empathy. Humanity.

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:25.472
You'd wager the survival
of our country on that?

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.266
And what if you're wrong?

01:10:27.892 --> 01:10:29.852
What if their intentions
are completely defensive?

01:10:29.977 --> 01:10:33.063
Well, what if you're wrong
and they're not?

01:10:36.442 --> 01:10:38.152
What's her depth now?

01:10:38.319 --> 01:10:41.655
Two hundred
meters bearing two-seven-five.

01:10:41.822 --> 01:10:44.783
All ahead, full.
Come left, two-seven-five.

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.286
Aye, sir. All ahead, full.
Come left, two-seven-five.

01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:51.665
Forward torpedo,
open doors one and two.

01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:53.417
- Aye, opening doors one and two.
- They'll hear us.

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:55.794
Not if we're behind them.
Five degree up bubble.

01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:58.047
- Aye aye, sir. Five degree up bubble.
- But we'll be blind.

01:10:58.213 --> 01:11:00.883
If she slows down,
we'll run right into her.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:04.345
That's right.

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:16.315
Forward torpedo, set the torpedoes
for manual detonation.

01:11:16.482 --> 01:11:17.803
- Why manual?
- I'm not gonna sink

01:11:17.942 --> 01:11:21.362
a boat full of patriots if disabling her
will give us the same effect.

01:11:21.904 --> 01:11:25.491
Forward torpedo, stand by to fire.

01:11:25.658 --> 01:11:29.203
November, 1200 meters,
bearing two-seven-five.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:33.415
- Do we have a firing solution?
- Yes, sir. Firing solution is loaded.

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:37.461
- Fire tube one.
- Fire!

01:11:42.007 --> 01:11:44.677
- Fire tube two.
- Fire two!

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:52.935
She's opening her doors.

01:11:57.064 --> 01:12:00.150
Two fish in the water,
bearing zero-niner-five.

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:05.197
Release all remaining

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:07.724
countermeasures. Blow ballast
and commence emergency ascent.

01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:09.243
Emergency ascent. Aye, sir.

01:12:19.086 --> 01:12:21.171
- Move, move, move!
- Go, go, go!

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:30.097
Forward torpedo,
stand by to detonate torpedo one.

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:31.306
Aye, sir.

01:12:35.394 --> 01:12:36.895
Detonate torpedo one.

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:47.239
OK, OK.

01:12:51.952 --> 01:12:55.622
Sonar, con. Range of second
torpedo to the November?

01:12:55.789 --> 01:12:57.624
Three hundred meters, closing.

01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:01.795
- Prepare to detonate torpedo two.
- Aye, sir.

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:03.964
Torpedo is 150 meters from the November.

01:13:04.131 --> 01:13:07.092
- Detonate torpedo two.
- Detonate torpedo two!

01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:21.148
She's blowing her ballast!

01:13:21.315 --> 01:13:23.734
She's headed to the surface!

01:13:44.088 --> 01:13:45.672
Captain...

01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:51.011
surface the ship.

01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:02.272
Do you have any authority
for doing this?

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:05.526
Secretariat, the Central Committee,
anyone?

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:09.029
Politicians have no stomach
for anything but self-preservation.

01:14:09.196 --> 01:14:12.407
This man proves that.

01:14:14.034 --> 01:14:15.702
What's our target package?

01:14:15.869 --> 01:14:19.206
We will create the conditions necessary
for our leaders to seize absolute...

01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:22.960
- What's the target?
- The Pacific Fleet at Midway.

01:14:23.127 --> 01:14:25.796
Once the Phantom is engaged,
and the Americans are fooled

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:28.763
into believing that the Chinese
launched a nuclear strike against them,

01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:31.343
they will have no choice
but to retaliate.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.971
We will step aside as our enemies
destroy each other.

01:14:34.138 --> 01:14:37.224
We will emerge
on the right side of history.

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:44.189
You give me no recourse.

01:14:46.692 --> 01:14:48.652
Recourse for what?

01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:50.696
To take back my ship.

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:54.074
Drop your weapons.

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:06.461
Mr. Bavenod.

01:15:17.598 --> 01:15:19.057
Contingencies, Captain.

01:15:20.851 --> 01:15:24.313
You didn't think I was gonna leave you
alone to plot our defeat, did you?

01:15:36.158 --> 01:15:38.118
They're trying to get to the missile.

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:52.674
You.

01:16:27.334 --> 01:16:28.335
Post a man.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:51.900
Your firing keys.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.396
I will not ask you twice.

01:17:42.242 --> 01:17:45.620
You really think religious icons
are gonna save you?

01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:52.961
Fuel the missile.

01:18:03.764 --> 01:18:06.308
Enter the firing coordinates.

01:18:07.601 --> 01:18:09.394
Loading into firing computer.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:12.939
- You'll be starting the apocalypse.
- Not me.

01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:15.650
You, Demi.

01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:19.154
You'll be remembered as the man
who turned our enemies to dust.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:23.116
Years from now, children will be
taught your name in school,

01:18:23.283 --> 01:18:28.622
and you'll be honored as the hero you've
always longed to be, but never were.

01:18:38.298 --> 01:18:39.841
Missile fueling complete, sir.

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:42.386
Activate the warhead.

01:18:49.142 --> 01:18:50.977
Warhead activation complete.

01:18:54.481 --> 01:18:57.526
- Loading into firing computer.
- Begin firing sequence.

01:18:57.692 --> 01:19:01.321
Enter launch code four-seven-seven...

01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:03.448
five-three-six.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:11.540
Shit!

01:19:11.706 --> 01:19:13.500
The launch code's been compromised.

01:19:15.377 --> 01:19:16.545
Bring him!

01:19:16.711 --> 01:19:19.673
All of them!

01:19:22.843 --> 01:19:24.428
Bring him.

01:19:26.638 --> 01:19:27.931
Easy.

01:19:36.273 --> 01:19:38.692
- Bavenod, stand a post.
- Aye aye, sir.

01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:40.944
Open the safe!

01:19:41.111 --> 01:19:43.363
- What good is that gonna do?
- There's an encrypted water mark

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.530
on the ship's orders
with an alternate launch code.

01:19:45.657 --> 01:19:47.033
Do not test me!

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.078
Demi... don't open it.

01:19:51.121 --> 01:19:53.540
No!

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:02.549
Sometimes you gotta pick a side.

01:20:12.392 --> 01:20:14.895
For God's sake, Demi,
do not open that...

01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:17.230
No!

01:20:17.898 --> 01:20:21.234
I have a bullet for every man
on this ship, Captain, including you.

01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:23.570
- Now open the goddamn safe.
- You son-of-a-bitch!

01:20:23.737 --> 01:20:27.073
Contact bearing
zero-six-zero, 1500 meters.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.408
It's the November, sir.

01:20:28.575 --> 01:20:31.286
- That's why you left them alive.
- Contingencies.

01:20:33.205 --> 01:20:34.998
Con, sonar.
Torpedoes in the water!

01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:38.001
Gubin's gonna sink this ship,
he's gonna sink you!

01:20:38.168 --> 01:20:39.252
You can be next.

01:20:39.419 --> 01:20:41.254
Engage the Phantom.

01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:47.886
Go.

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:03.443
Sir, the launch code is
zero-eight-nine-six-eight-seven.

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:19.292
Con, sonar.
Torpedoes now 1200 meters!

01:21:19.459 --> 01:21:22.295
Open the missile tube.

01:21:29.636 --> 01:21:31.012
Oh, shit.

01:21:32.973 --> 01:21:34.641
Don't do it.

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:37.894
Don't do it.

01:21:41.398 --> 01:21:45.485
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:21:45.652 --> 01:21:48.655
six, five, four,

01:21:48.822 --> 01:21:52.659
three, two, one!

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:09.235
Dive the boat. All ahead full
on port and starboard engines.

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:11.237
- Aye, Captain.
- Secure the hatch.

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:12.364
Aye, sir.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:14.699
- Close the missile tube.
- Aye, sir.

01:23:14.866 --> 01:23:16.034
Closing the missile tube.

01:23:22.582 --> 01:23:24.584
Torpedoes closing now, 700 meters!

01:23:25.377 --> 01:23:27.879
- Aft torpedo, fire the remaining decoy.
- Aye, sir.

01:23:32.258 --> 01:23:35.845
Right full rudder, all ahead flank.
Emergency dive.

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:39.307
Right full rudder, all ahead flank.
Dive, dive, dive!

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.603
Con, sonar. Torpedoes, 500 meters,
closing now very quickly.

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:46.106
Brace for impact.

01:24:22.392 --> 01:24:26.479
- We're on the bottom.
- Yes.

01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:29.274
We haven't been crushed.

01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:32.944
You sound disappointed.

01:24:33.653 --> 01:24:35.238
Surprised.

01:24:35.405 --> 01:24:38.533
We're sitting
on the French Frigate Shoals...

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:41.661
a flooded mountain range.

01:24:43.413 --> 01:24:45.999
So close to the surface
we could almost swim.

01:24:48.418 --> 01:24:50.712
You don't remember me, do you?

01:24:51.463 --> 01:24:52.964
Why would I?

01:24:56.259 --> 01:24:59.387
I was your boatswain's mate
on this very boat.

01:25:01.139 --> 01:25:03.558
You ordered me to seal the hatch
on the lives of all the men

01:25:03.725 --> 01:25:05.727
in the forward battery.

01:25:08.438 --> 01:25:14.319
Afterward, I didn't have your choices,
Demi... didn't have your father.

01:25:14.486 --> 01:25:17.697
So this is what? A vendetta?

01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:21.534
It wasn't personal.

01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:23.828
You were a target of opportunity.

01:25:27.707 --> 01:25:28.583
Yeah?

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:30.470
We're trying to
cross-connect the air banks,

01:25:30.627 --> 01:25:32.212
but we're running out of pressure.

01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:34.255
Do your best, Alex.

01:25:34.422 --> 01:25:36.007
Keep me posted.

01:25:37.258 --> 01:25:39.552
Missiles between
the Americans and the Chinese

01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:42.388
are crossing in the air as we speak.

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:44.891
We're lost.

01:25:45.058 --> 01:25:47.352
Why not accept it?

01:25:53.733 --> 01:25:56.194
There's something down here with us.

01:25:57.821 --> 01:25:59.614
It's outside the ship.

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:02.075
- I hear voices.
- Listen to me.

01:26:02.242 --> 01:26:04.619
You're breathing poisoned air.

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:07.038
OK? You understand me?

01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:09.457
You have to breathe. Breathe.
Put that on.

01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:12.669
Put this on. Breathe.

01:26:12.836 --> 01:26:15.421
- Where's your post?
- Over there.

01:26:15.588 --> 01:26:17.048
You show me.

01:26:25.807 --> 01:26:27.600
Keep that on.

01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:34.983
Put that on yourself.

01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:38.736
Saltwater's in the battery deck.

01:26:49.998 --> 01:26:51.916
Get into the egress suit.

01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:58.464
If I'm going to die,

01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:01.759
I'm going to do it here,
with my crew, with you.

01:27:01.926 --> 01:27:05.972
Listen to me,
Gubin's up there somewhere.

01:27:06.973 --> 01:27:09.475
You're the only chance we have for...

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:12.312
a rescue.

01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:18.651
Or to explain that this
was the work of madmen.

01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:22.947
Not our country.

01:27:24.949 --> 01:27:26.951
Not these men.

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:32.832
If the Americans find me?

01:27:32.999 --> 01:27:35.001
Tell 'em everything.

01:27:36.586 --> 01:27:39.505
And if the missile detonated?

01:27:39.672 --> 01:27:43.176
Then it'll be a beautiful sunrise.

01:27:58.358 --> 01:28:00.693
- You in there?
- Yeah, I got it.

01:28:07.909 --> 01:28:10.161
I want you to give this to Sophi.

01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:17.585
Give this...
give that to my little girl.

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.464
Tell her to wear it in her hair.

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.645
You were dreaming.

01:29:18.938 --> 01:29:21.024
My watch stopped.

01:29:43.588 --> 01:29:45.882
There's somebody out there.

01:29:59.729 --> 01:30:01.564
They found us.

01:30:01.731 --> 01:30:03.566
They're raising the boat.

01:30:32.345 --> 01:30:34.263
This is a restricted area, Captain.

01:30:41.813 --> 01:30:43.439
This was my boat.

01:30:45.108 --> 01:30:47.568
And this is my captain's family.

01:31:25.565 --> 01:31:28.901
Apparently the Americans
showed self-discipline.

01:31:40.329 --> 01:31:43.040
We didn't make it, did we?

01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:46.085
No, son, we didn't.

01:32:06.814 --> 01:32:10.359
I wish he knew how proud I am.

01:32:15.531 --> 01:32:17.575
He knows, sweetheart.

01:32:20.661 --> 01:32:22.246
He knows.
