WEBVTT

01:01.937 --> 01:04.394
Do you know what day it is,
Mr. Crozier?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.103
What day of the week, I mean.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.025
No.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.605
It's a Wednesday.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.030
You and I once shared a drink
on a Wednesday.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.697
Do you remember that day?

01:23.917 --> 01:27.410
I do. You had a dog turd
in your hand.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.417
The toast was "Ourselves."

01:32.884 --> 01:35.001
That was fitting then.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.631
But so it is again today.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.635
You misunderstand the toast,
Mr. Hickey.

01:39.725 --> 01:43.309
It was meant as a joke.
Not a very clever one.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.767
Mr. Des Voeux.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.154
Have Goodsir tend
to Mr. Crozier's injuries.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.072
And make sure
he's not harmed again.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.866
He took a stumble.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.750
The men you asked for
are assembled, sir.

02:31.568 --> 02:35.187
<i>Men, whether we want it or not,</i>

02:35.280 --> 02:37.363
<i>we are drawn
by the events of yesterday</i>

02:37.449 --> 02:39.657
<i>into a conflict
with the other camp.</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:43.827
<i>We must plan a party
to retrieve our Captain</i>

02:43.914 --> 02:46.998
and any other men who are
compelled against their will.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.794
And arrest this coven
of traitors once and for all.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.502
What about
the Captain's orders, sir?

02:55.592 --> 02:57.299
For us to keep moving south.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.129
You can guess my mind
on that subject, I'm certain.

03:02.099 --> 03:06.969
Now, Private Hammond
believes the other camp

03:07.062 --> 03:10.021
should not be hard to track
on this ground.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.315
They certainly had
no trouble finding us.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.394
We prefer
the Captain's orders, sir.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.568
To hell with
the Captain's orders.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.030
We have a camp
of nearly 30 men here.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.827
We've got nine so ill
they cannot walk,

03:25.914 --> 03:27.371
with no surgeon to tend them.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.871
We've but two able-bodied
lieutenants for the lot of us.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.953
None of us speaks
the Netsilik tongue.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.459
None has been
in the polar regions before.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.584
To restore
our best chance of survival,

03:39.678 --> 03:43.092
we must restore our Captain.
Surely that is plain.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.887
And given we have Hickey's camp
outnumbered and outgunned,

03:46.977 --> 03:50.721
we can expect to retrieve him
without a single man lost.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.807
We prefer the order, sir.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.065
Well, I'm giving a different order.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.397
There's been a vote, Edward.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.611
When?

04:07.998 --> 04:10.035
An hour ago.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.117
Before you woke.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.005
It was not to oppose
your command in this camp.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.834
That is without question.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.677
It was to ratify
the Captain's order.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.843
One given in sound mind,

04:26.933 --> 04:29.391
with the full knowledge
of our situation.

04:29.478 --> 04:34.269
You would leave...
our Captain with that devil?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.849
He wouldn't have
urged us to go on

04:36.943 --> 04:40.607
if he didn't think
it were the best plan, sir.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.316
We've also voted that each man
can do as he wishes.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.319
We'd not force you
to come with us.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.537
We'll leave supplies
for the ill.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.162
Most of us are ill.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.708
We're leaving today.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.208
Those who cannot walk
on their own to a sledge

04:57.297 --> 04:58.788
will stay.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.295
Once we make
our next land camp,

05:02.385 --> 05:04.377
if we can,
we'll return for them.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.300
He also ordered
we not leave any man behind.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.804
You expediently leave that out.

05:15.607 --> 05:18.725
What if I and anyone here who
still feels the pull of loyalty

05:18.819 --> 05:21.527
organize our own rescue party?

05:21.613 --> 05:25.732
Edward...
we hope you'll come with us.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.744
To what? Haul?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.822
And to survive.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.112
I know Lieutenant Little's nature.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.037
He'll be here by day's end.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.785
With a dozen armed men.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.575
We need to be ready.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.579
I counted 11 men total.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.460
But what about arms?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.712
Who carries them?

06:27.804 --> 06:32.549
Tozer, Manson, Armitage...

06:35.604 --> 06:37.391
Pilkington...

06:37.480 --> 06:38.812
Gibson.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.233
No, no. Gibson's gone as well.

06:43.236 --> 06:47.230
I think... Des Voeux has his gun now.

06:47.324 --> 06:50.237
Gone?
Do you mean he ran off?

06:52.621 --> 06:55.705
Dead, sir, and consumed.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.205
I'm sorry.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.207
However unpleasant to hear,

07:02.297 --> 07:04.789
I must put what is going on
here into words.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.844
- Five guns, then.
- Yes, sir.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.392
We thought the creature
was at the ridge to our north

07:16.478 --> 07:18.595
three days ago.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.431
Hickey ordered every man
out to face it and...

07:22.651 --> 07:24.768
I counted five.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.228
Well done. Well done.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.277
If the chance to run comes,

07:34.371 --> 07:39.036
and we are not together,
go southeast. Yes?

07:40.293 --> 07:42.285
Captain, will you do something for me?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.666
When you return to London,

07:44.756 --> 07:47.499
will you deliver this to a girl there?

07:48.551 --> 07:50.884
I promised I would get it to her.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.012
It belonged to her brother.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.886
All these months, I thought it lost

07:55.976 --> 07:58.639
but it's found its way back to me and...

07:58.728 --> 08:01.562
I have a chance now
to see it where it needs to go.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.934
You will deliver it yourself.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.437
I will not leave this camp, Captain.

08:06.778 --> 08:07.894
I know that.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.980
You mustn't lose heart.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.489
I need your help, Doctor.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.910
If ever I was a doctor,
I am one no longer.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.828
Even if God is seeing
every last thing we do here,

08:24.921 --> 08:26.662
you have nothing to fear.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.917
Not you.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.130
You're clean, Goodsir.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.094
Clean.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.764
Even as your hand is forced by swine.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.264
Is God here, Captain?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.679
Any god?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.566
It doesn't matter.

08:49.154 --> 08:53.239
This place is beautiful to me, even now.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.193
To see it with eyes as a child's...

08:58.747 --> 09:01.490
there is wonder here, Captain.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.380
And her? Do you...

09:11.217 --> 09:13.049
Do you think she's still alive?

09:13.136 --> 09:17.881
Silence? This place is her home.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.718
She'll be back with her people by now.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.222
Do you think so?

09:23.313 --> 09:24.474
Yes.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.895
Good. Good.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.401
I'll deliver it if I can.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.662
To whom did it belong?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.415
I...

09:46.503 --> 09:48.540
I made him a promise.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.005
Yes?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.628
I'll find his sister by his name.

09:59.599 --> 10:04.219
He was afraid. He...
He said he wants us to run.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.473
Yes?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.976
Uh... His name was...

10:08.066 --> 10:09.932
His name was?

10:10.026 --> 10:12.359
Uh...

10:22.455 --> 10:24.663
Your color's better now.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.490
Thank you, Manson.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.669
Sorry. Mr. Hickey says I'm not
to call you Captain any more.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.506
I'm to take you to him now.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.584
That's all right, Magnus.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.431
You're a good boy, I know.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.145
Argh... It's a test, isn't it?

10:51.276 --> 10:53.268
Of our mettle.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.477
Captain.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.406
If you're still in the camp
when a meal is made out of me,

10:58.491 --> 11:01.700
honor bright, Captain,
do not accept. And if he insists...

11:01.786 --> 11:03.322
We will not let it come to that.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.995
If he insists,

11:05.081 --> 11:06.913
eat only of my feet, do you understand?

11:07.000 --> 11:11.085
My feet. The soles, if possible.
The toughest part.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.335
Do you understand?
Everything depends on this.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.680
All set?

11:25.268 --> 11:27.351
Haul!

11:30.607 --> 11:32.644
Right. Haul!

11:54.714 --> 11:56.706
Captain!

12:52.063 --> 12:54.646
Captain!

12:56.025 --> 12:58.358
We'll be settling down for sick nap soon.

13:00.196 --> 13:04.065
But... come and sit
for a moment, Mr. Crozier.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.994
I've been looking forward to this.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.327
Why not let Lieutenant Hodgson go back?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.996
He's some men back at the other camp

13:19.090 --> 13:21.173
who could use his leadership.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.799
Mr. Diggle, Dr. Goodsir, Manson.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.766
They could accompany Lieutenant Hodgson.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.349
He was the first
of your officers I enlisted.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.016
I remember the day.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.936
He had a dog leg in his hand.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.616
Oh.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.612
Well, I forgive him.
I forgive all of them.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.867
But you.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.199
Do you include yourself
in that forgiveness?

13:57.378 --> 13:59.836
I won't know till the end of this.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.753
You hold yourself
to the standard of a man

14:03.843 --> 14:05.254
you are not...

14:06.262 --> 14:09.255
nor should ever have tried to be.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.051
You've let shame drive you on and on.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.560
It's part of why we are where we are.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.360
Then why have me brought here at all?

14:24.822 --> 14:26.905
At great risk to your men.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.153
Tuunbaq.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.415
A spirit that dresses as an animal.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.540
Yet we shot it with
a cannon and drew blood.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.373
- How do you reconcile that?
- I can't.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.215
There's much about this voyage
I can't reconcile.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.594
What mythology is this creature
at the center of?

14:52.683 --> 14:55.596
About the creature,
I have no answers, Mr. Hickey.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.472
We were not meant to know of it.

15:06.364 --> 15:11.109
I didn't have anywhere near
an equal on this expedition.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.072
But you.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.201
I wanted to thank you for that.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.122
On the eve of what is...
quite an important day.

15:30.138 --> 15:34.724
You must be a surpassingly
lonely man, Mr. Hickey.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.763
Not for long.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.439
I can probably spring those for you later.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.444
We'll have all night to try.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.952
You might be able to run before dawn.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.962
Not yet, Mr. Diggle.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.846
I want to try to take
some of you back with me.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.014
When Little and the others arrive.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.800
That'll be any time now.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.636
Then how can I help?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.687
Follow any signal I give you.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.435
Everyone out!

19:59.323 --> 20:01.315
Something's happened.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.987
He always wanted to help, didn't he?

20:49.874 --> 20:53.584
You'd waste this man? Of all men!

20:53.669 --> 20:56.412
He wasted himself, Mr. Crozier.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.213
Piece of glass through the wrist.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.926
If he only wanted to die,
he could have...

21:03.012 --> 21:04.878
run out into the hills and starved.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.598
But he didn't. He made a gift
of himself for the rest of us,

21:08.684 --> 21:10.596
is the way I see it.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.678
And at the supper hour.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.556
Come and join us.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.022
Let the men begin.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.113
It will not happen.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.817
Private Armitage,
bring Mr. Crozier forward.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.128
Mr. Golding, stand up.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.026
After dinner,
we're climbing the hill, men.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.241
There's something needs doing
now Mr. Crozier's with us.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.661
A few of you will have
parts to play as well.

23:43.672 --> 23:48.167
Mr. Des Voeux, do we still
have with us that boat chain?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.047
We do.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.664
Forgive Father not coming down, Sir James.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.412
He's not well just today.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.871
Ah. Well, I won't impose on his rest.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.423
I wanted only to say my farewells.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.467
I leave Wednesday next
for Lancaster Sound

24:31.553 --> 24:33.044
to see about Sir John and Francis.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.925
I'm relieved to hear it.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.095
Father thinks it's the right choice,
after all, not to wait.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.427
There's momentum built up
in the public now for this.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.012
Mm.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.598
The <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Investigator</i>
are marvelous ships.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.684
He can have every confidence there.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.356
Richardson and Rae
leave overland in June

24:49.446 --> 24:51.984
and the <i>Plover</i> should be well
on her way to join the search

24:52.074 --> 24:53.815
from the Pacific end by then as well.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.702
We'll come at it by east, west and south.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.121
Well, then you're sure to find it.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.916
That'll bring more comfort
to my father than you can know.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.086
He wants it found while he still lives.

25:06.171 --> 25:09.005
His own "chilly shortcut
to China," he calls it.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.009
<i>Haul!</i>

25:13.095 --> 25:15.838
Come on!

25:20.936 --> 25:22.893
Push!

25:35.451 --> 25:36.942
Halt!

25:39.747 --> 25:42.410
Fire a shot, Private Pilkington.
Do it now.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.499
Here, <i>Terror!</i>

25:50.382 --> 25:55.468
- Where was he last seen?
- South. Two miles.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.216
Staggering off a weak left side.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.548
Let me off this chain!

25:59.641 --> 26:02.884
He is sick, then... the creature?

26:02.978 --> 26:04.059
Cornelius!

26:04.146 --> 26:07.184
He's sick from what he eats, Mr. Hickey.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.615
And in English, Mr. Hodgson?

26:17.701 --> 26:20.535
"Tell me what you eat...

26:20.621 --> 26:22.829
and I will tell you what you are."

26:22.915 --> 26:24.577
I detect a double meaning there.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.909
If we don't meet the creature soon,

26:28.003 --> 26:30.620
we set up a signal fire on this hill.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.627
He may not have his senses.
He may need help finding us.

26:33.717 --> 26:37.006
Have we come here
to give it a royal death, then?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.713
If it's ill, we should put
every shot we have in its head

26:39.807 --> 26:41.014
and butcher it.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.716
Now, while it's weak.

26:42.810 --> 26:43.926
I have a different plan.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.057
Well, perhaps it's time
you told us what that plan is.

26:47.147 --> 26:50.936
That creature is everything we need.
Meat and fur.

26:51.026 --> 26:54.190
We can make at least
ten greatcoats out of it.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.271
And make it back to London full bricks.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.444
You think you're going back? No.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.948
Where else are we hoping to get?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.455
I can't go back.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.956
Oh!

27:15.259 --> 27:17.467
A man called Cornelius Hickey

27:17.553 --> 27:21.797
told me this expedition
was a year in the Polar Sea.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.631
And then out the other side.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.474
He told me the ship's plan
to stop at the Sandwich Islands

27:28.564 --> 27:30.647
and the crew was
going to dry out in the sun.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.817
"That's the other side
of the world," I thought.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.688
"A year's nothing."

27:38.907 --> 27:41.490
So I dabbed him,
left him in Regent's Canal.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.827
And here I am instead.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.620
You could have just joined up.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.243
I was gonna show you my heels

27:48.333 --> 27:50.700
when we got to those islands, you know?

27:50.794 --> 27:53.207
I was gonna hook it and start new.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.258
I've seen the drawings in the weeklies.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.053
O'ahu.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.180
Maui.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.009
That sounded nice.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.220
No one told me I'd be freezing to death

28:10.314 --> 28:12.397
three bloody years instead, did they?

28:12.482 --> 28:15.350
I've learnt what I needed to.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.026
Bugger London, I'm going forward.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.695
Only forward. Call it with me now, boys.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.067
Come on, together.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.252
Come on!

28:38.342 --> 28:40.755
This has to carry, men. Come on!

28:48.310 --> 28:49.926
We're here!

28:50.729 --> 28:53.437
Bugger Victoria! We're here!

28:53.523 --> 28:55.765
Bugger Nelson! Bugger Jesus!

28:55.859 --> 28:58.192
Bugger Joseph and Mary!

28:58.278 --> 29:00.941
Bugger the Archbishop of Canterbury!

29:01.031 --> 29:02.772
None ever wanted nothing from me!

29:03.825 --> 29:05.612
It's here! It's here!

29:05.702 --> 29:07.819
Hand me your glass, Magnus.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.166
Are we gonna kill it or not?

29:14.253 --> 29:16.620
Let it come, Mr. Des Voeux.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.332
Open yourself to courage.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.092
What if we're not
the heroes of this story?

29:24.179 --> 29:26.546
It will go after those
who are running, at first.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.131
Every story we've ever been told

29:28.225 --> 29:30.512
about the holy throne
of Britain has a shine on it,

29:30.602 --> 29:31.638
doesn't it?

29:31.728 --> 29:34.015
But I bet you never saw in Shoreditch

29:34.106 --> 29:36.189
the breath of a god in the air.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.479
Never met a man with his soul ate out.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.777
There are holy things before us.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.526
Magnus, Mr. Des Voeux,
come forward to the others.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.107
Stagger your position on a line.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.363
When it comes over the top,
it's gonna have its head low,

29:48.453 --> 29:49.910
so anticipate that with your aim.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.034
Argh!

29:52.916 --> 29:55.533
Our empire is not the only empire.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.540
- We've seen that now.
- If you run, you'll die.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.460
If you miss, we'll die.

30:01.550 --> 30:05.294
Tommy, give me your gun.
I'm the best shot here!

30:07.389 --> 30:09.506
There's nothing that way, Mr. Hoar!

30:21.528 --> 30:23.269
- Sorry, Tom.
- It's before me!

30:24.573 --> 30:26.155
Hold, Private!

30:26.241 --> 30:28.483
Pull the chains!

30:28.577 --> 30:30.569
Argh!

30:32.205 --> 30:34.197
Pull the chain back. Pull it back!

30:42.007 --> 30:44.044
Diggle, don't run! Don't run!

30:48.263 --> 30:49.379
Argh!

30:52.768 --> 30:54.680
Come on! Come on!

30:54.770 --> 30:56.762
Be still.

30:57.773 --> 30:58.889
Stop moving!

30:58.982 --> 31:00.939
Argh!

31:07.824 --> 31:10.191
No! no!

31:10.285 --> 31:12.777
Whoa. whoa.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.716
Magnus. Come and see.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.394
There!

31:48.657 --> 31:50.114
Argh!

31:50.200 --> 31:51.566
Captain!

32:00.669 --> 32:03.002
Argh!

32:09.010 --> 32:10.342
Argh!

32:47.716 --> 32:49.378
Ohh!

34:41.496 --> 34:44.489
God! Thank you.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.208
Help me!

34:58.638 --> 35:00.595
Wait...

39:08.847 --> 39:11.305
Charles Earl Best...

39:13.184 --> 39:15.597
George Chambers...

39:16.437 --> 39:19.475
John Weekes...

44:03.641 --> 44:05.633
Edward.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.236
Close?

46:01.175 --> 46:02.507
Silna?

49:35.973 --> 49:37.965
Silna?

50:43.499 --> 50:45.115
We saw a captain there.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.246
The one called "Aglooka."

50:51.298 --> 50:54.882
Ask him... if one of these men

50:54.969 --> 50:58.553
is the one he's calling Aglooka.

51:07.398 --> 51:09.606
"He spoke in our tongue.

51:09.692 --> 51:10.933
He was dying."

51:12.903 --> 51:16.067
What did Francis say? Aglooka.

51:20.286 --> 51:22.278
"Your friend took my hands.

51:22.371 --> 51:25.785
He said, 'Tell those
who come after us not to stay.

51:27.293 --> 51:29.285
The ships are gone.

51:29.587 --> 51:32.204
There is no way through, no passage.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.297
<i>Tell them we are gone.</i>

51:36.594 --> 51:39.587
<i>Dead... and gone.'"</i>
