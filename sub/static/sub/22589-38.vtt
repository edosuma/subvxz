<i>NARRATOR".
When we last saw the Dynamic Duo...</i>

00:12.263 --> 00:16.601
<i>...the fiendish Joker had tied them to an altar
in the Gotham City Museum...</i>

00:16.768 --> 00:18.937
<i>...beneath a huge meteorite...</i>

00:19.103 --> 00:25.610
<i>...which will fall when its supporting cable
is cut by a revolving thermite fuse.</i>

00:25.777 --> 00:28.363
<i>How much time before they're crushed?</i>

00:30.114 --> 00:32.408
<i>Certainly less than when we left them.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:44.731 --> 01:45.898
Holy mashed potatoes.

01:46.065 --> 01:50.737
- When the thermite burns through the cable--
-We still have one slim chance, Robin.

01:50.903 --> 01:54.490
I've managed to loosen my hand slightly.

01:54.657 --> 02:01.331
If I can just break out my Batarang,
maybe I can divert that thermite.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.501
Agh!

02:06.002 --> 02:07.837
There it is, Robin.

02:10.089 --> 02:13.051
Now, we'll need patience.

02:13.217 --> 02:17.555
I won't be able to make my throw
until the thermite is directly overhead.

02:17.722 --> 02:20.433
- But by then, it'll be almost at the cable.
-Yes, Robin.

02:20.850 --> 02:27.106
I'll have just three seconds
to aim and throw.

02:27.273 --> 02:30.401
What the devil could have happened
to Batman?

02:30.568 --> 02:33.946
Sure and we've been up all night
waiting for him to call.

02:34.113 --> 02:37.200
Commissioner, I'm getting worried.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.160
You have a point, Chief O'Hara.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.912
- We'll call Batman.
-All right.

02:41.079 --> 02:43.081
For that, you'll need a medium.

02:44.832 --> 02:49.629
I'm sorry to report that the Tenacious Twosome
have been trapped, tied and terminated.

02:49.796 --> 02:51.339
That's a lie.

02:51.506 --> 02:53.716
Well, actually, I have the wrong tense.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.427
They will be squashed
in a matter of moments.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.514
- You're raving!
-Ah! Caution, commissioner.

02:59.681 --> 03:03.351
No, I'm not raving, I'm raiding.

03:03.518 --> 03:06.229
My next target, Libra, the Scales.

03:06.396 --> 03:07.480
In here?

03:07.647 --> 03:08.981
No, out there.

03:14.404 --> 03:16.239
That, sir, is a statue of Justice.

03:16.406 --> 03:18.825
And carved of priceless Carrara marble.

03:18.991 --> 03:21.035
Cash value, half a million.

03:21.202 --> 03:24.831
Why, have you no scruples,
you jesting jackanapes?

03:24.997 --> 03:26.249
Scruples? Ha-ha-ha!

03:26.416 --> 03:28.167
The cash value of scruples is 0.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.378
No, I prefer Carrara marble.

03:30.545 --> 03:33.673
As for Justice,
she shall be served with a hook.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.177
At the precise moment the Dynamic Duo
become the Mashed Marauders.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.596
- You demon!
-Ah!

03:44.475 --> 03:45.977
Quick-frozen cops.

03:46.144 --> 03:48.855
What a delightful dish. Ha-ha-ha!

03:49.021 --> 03:52.775
Now to put the snatch on Justice.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.255
Careful. Oh, careful.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.757
There's half a million
in Carrara marble there.

04:21.345 --> 04:26.058
Now, marble going up,
meteorite going down.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.853
And now...

04:29.353 --> 04:33.649
But there's a chance the thermite will burn
right through our bonds.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.041
We would've been tomato paste.

04:50.208 --> 04:53.294
Instead, Joker's going to be canned.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.214
Away, away, away. Ha-ha-ha!

05:00.134 --> 05:03.471
- What happened, commissioner?
-Shock paralysis, chief.

05:03.638 --> 05:06.766
Fortunately, it only lasts a few minutes.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.563
Commissioner Gordon speaking.

05:12.730 --> 05:16.025
Sound the alarm.
The Joker is escaping via the side entrance.

05:24.992 --> 05:28.496
After them! They've stolen Justice!

05:33.793 --> 05:35.378
Get the police radio band, Robin.

05:35.545 --> 05:38.881
Joker's probably been busy
while we were tied to that altar.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.968
<i>Calling all cars, calling all cars.</i>

05:42.134 --> 05:44.512
The Joker has stolen Justice.

05:44.679 --> 05:49.225
Tow truck carrying the lady
believed heading for Juniper Street.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.143
All cars in the vicinity...

05:51.310 --> 05:53.354
<i>...proceed at once to Juniper Street.</i>

05:53.521 --> 05:54.689
Juniper Street it is.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.701
Attention. This is car number 72.

06:06.868 --> 06:09.871
Have just spotted the tow truck
in vicinity of Mulberry Lane.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.372
Am pursuing.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.340
How did that truck get to Mulberry Lane
in two minutes?

06:21.507 --> 06:26.137
Joker probably has that truck souped-up.
We'd better head for Mulberry Lane.

06:26.304 --> 06:28.556
Attention. This is car number 41.

06:28.723 --> 06:32.018
Have just seen tow truck
at intersection of Dopple and Briar Streets.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.352
Am pursuing.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.522
Brace for Bat-turn.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.871
Attention. This is car number 98.

06:52.038 --> 06:54.665
Have spotted tow truck traveling west
on Finley Road.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.417
<i>Am pursuing.</i>

06:56.584 --> 07:00.504
Holy sonic booms, Batman. That truck
couldn't have gotten to Finley Road this fast.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.925
Nor could it be traveling west
since Finley Road runs north and south.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.302
Switch on the police radio band cut-in.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.348
Attention all squad cars.
Attention all squad cars.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.600
This is Batman speaking.

07:12.767 --> 07:16.562
Disregard all instructions broadcast
on this wavelength.

07:16.729 --> 07:19.690
Batman. You're supposed to be dead.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.192
Crushed by that meteorite.

07:21.359 --> 07:24.695
<i>Well, I'm not dead, Joker. Neither is Robin.</i>

07:24.862 --> 07:27.448
We escaped that cunning trap of yours.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.575
Incredible, impossible.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.494
But a fact, Joker.

07:31.661 --> 07:34.205
And justice will catch up with you.

07:34.372 --> 07:36.457
<i>Oh, you're wrong there, Batman.</i>

07:36.624 --> 07:38.334
I've stolen Justice.

07:38.501 --> 07:42.088
And dead or alive,
you're too late to stop the next theft...

07:42.254 --> 07:44.090
<i>...of my criminal zodiac.</i>

07:44.256 --> 07:45.424
Scorpio.

07:45.591 --> 07:48.177
<i>You're right, Boy Prunehead.</i>

07:48.344 --> 07:52.348
At this moment, the brightest star in my
criminal constellation is about to make off...

07:52.515 --> 07:55.226
...with Scorpio, the scorpion. Ha-ha-ha!

07:55.685 --> 07:57.812
Be stinging you, Batman.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.858
Brightest star? He must mean Venus.

08:03.025 --> 08:06.195
We mustn't judge her too harshly, Robin.

08:06.362 --> 08:10.533
Even with the best intentions,
it's hard to change a lifetime of habit.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.996
That gives me an idea.

08:21.002 --> 08:23.629
Let's see that rare art map, Robin.

08:26.132 --> 08:28.676
Ah. There it is, the Joker's next target.

08:28.843 --> 08:31.429
Of course,
the famous Durand Golden Scorpion.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.140
It's the same jewelry store
that he robbed before.

08:34.306 --> 08:38.561
Let's just hope we're in time to keep Venus
from making another tragic error.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.117
You.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.789
- Yes, madam?
-Brindle, Special Branch.

08:58.956 --> 09:02.752
- About your recent robbery.
-Oh, yes, tragic, terrible.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.462
May be another.

09:04.628 --> 09:08.924
Understand you have a priceless
antique jeweled scorpion, correct?

09:09.091 --> 09:11.135
Yes, uh, Ms., uh-- Officer--

09:11.302 --> 09:12.553
Just call me Brindle.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.598
- Let's see the scorpion.
-Yes, of course.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.276
Uh-huh.

09:28.402 --> 09:33.491
Just as I thought. Fake.
I'm taking this down to headquarters.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.993
And you had better have
a good explanation.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.413
But, Ms. Brindle,
did you say the scorpion is fake?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.415
Oh, no, the scorpion isn't fake.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.127
I am. Ha-ha-ha!

09:45.294 --> 09:47.171
Come back with my scorpion.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.352
Hurry up, please.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.234
- The scorpion, is it still here?
-Dynamic Duo.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.944
Where were you when I needed you?

10:10.402 --> 10:11.570
We're too late.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.197
It was that girl again.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.741
I'm ruined.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.994
First the Twins, now the Scorpion.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.956
You'll get them back
just as soon as we catch up with Joker.

10:22.123 --> 10:25.751
If anyone can do it, Dynamic Duo, you can.
Good luck.

10:29.964 --> 10:31.966
- Venus?
-Undoubtedly.

10:32.133 --> 10:35.469
But the main question is,
where will Joker strike next?

10:35.636 --> 10:39.598
- The next sign of the zodiac.
-Which is Sagittarius, the Archer.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.184
There sure aren't any golden archers
in Gotham City.

10:42.351 --> 10:46.814
There may not be a golden archer, Robin,
but there is a golden Bowman.

10:46.981 --> 10:50.818
Basil Bowman,
wealthy friend of millionaire Bruce Wayne.

10:50.985 --> 10:54.864
No doubt the Joker intends to steal him.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.407
Let's go.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.418
Excuse me. Is this the residence...

11:07.585 --> 11:10.880
...of the well-known millionaire Basil Bowman?
-it is.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.048
- And is he at home?
-He is.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.551
- And may we see him?
-You do.

11:15.718 --> 11:19.096
Oh, ha, ha! Delighted, Mr. Bowman.
Ha-ha-ha.

11:19.263 --> 11:22.099
- Well, what do you want?
-You.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.893
Wrap him up, boys.

11:24.059 --> 11:27.771
Do you dare, knowing the Dynamic Duo
will be dogging your trail?

11:27.938 --> 11:30.441
Those fleas? Fah! Ha-ha-ha.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.610
Wrap him up, boys. Ha-ha-ha.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.197
- Batman and Robin.
-Batman.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.531
Batman.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.326
- Smash them, smash them!
-Don't you dare!

11:40.492 --> 11:44.914
Thank you, Venus,
but I believe we can handle this.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.958
Oh, you do, Batman?

11:48.125 --> 11:51.545
One move and Venus is a dead dolly.

11:53.255 --> 11:58.385
I think we can find a more favorable occasion
for a showdown with the Caped Crusaders.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.471
Don't let him get away, Batman.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.848
It doesn't matter what he does to me.

12:03.015 --> 12:08.854
Oh, Batman won't endanger a girl,
now, will you, Batman?

12:11.440 --> 12:14.818
Tripped up by your own ethics. Ha-ha-ha!

12:14.985 --> 12:18.364
He who trips last, trips hardest.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.658
My final prediction for the day:

12:20.824 --> 12:22.701
I'm going to get clean away.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.371
And you, traitress, will pay.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.711
Venus, are you all right?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.173
Batman.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.759
I spoiled everything.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.554
The Joker got away and it's all my fault.

12:42.721 --> 12:46.225
Don't worry, Venus,
we will catch him eventually.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.602
Could I help?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.729
Please?

12:52.189 --> 12:54.650
Are you being sincere, Venus?

12:55.067 --> 12:57.444
Very sincere.

12:57.611 --> 13:01.699
I'm ashamed
of all the crimes I've committed.

13:03.409 --> 13:07.246
If you'd like to help me,
you could help a great deal.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.747
Oh.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.291
Think of it.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.253
Me, working with the Dynamic Duo.

13:16.255 --> 13:19.967
If only I'd met you when I was younger.

13:20.592 --> 13:24.388
A crooked path can often be straightened,
Venus.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.349
Oh, and mine will be straight.

13:28.142 --> 13:35.065
And I'll start by helping you get back
the Lion and the Crab.

13:35.232 --> 13:39.737
- Leo Crustash, the opera singer.
-Yes. Yes.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.043
- Is this the place, Venus?
- Yes.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.755
You'd better wait outside, Venus.
There may be trouble.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.130
Batman! Ow!

15:08.700 --> 15:09.827
Where's Crustash?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.585
Stop that sound.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.097
My voice, the tension.

15:30.264 --> 15:33.225
- You're all right, Mr. Crustash?
-Crustash is alive and kicking.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.310
- Where have you been, Batman?
-Searching for you.

15:36.770 --> 15:37.980
Where is Joker?

15:38.147 --> 15:39.273
Who knows? Who cares?

15:39.440 --> 15:43.610
<i>After spending</i> a <i>day in there
listening to that Music to Drill Teeth</i> By...

15:43.777 --> 15:47.281
...ugh, I gave him the ransom he demanded.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.658
And he didn't even cut that thing off!

15:52.536 --> 15:55.038
What ransom?

15:55.706 --> 15:57.374
What ransom?

15:57.541 --> 16:00.335
One hundred thousand dollars, Batman.

16:00.502 --> 16:03.755
If Joker's already gotten it,
he might be off anywhere...

16:03.922 --> 16:06.550
...putting it to no good purpose.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.886
Well, then call the bank
and see if he cashed the check.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.722
A check?

16:11.889 --> 16:12.973
What bank?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.392
Gotham National.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.853
We still may have time, Robin.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.189
- Let's go!
-I think we're too late, Batman.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.649
Joker cashed that ransom check
two hours ago.

16:22.816 --> 16:28.197
Now that you're caught, young woman,
I hope you realize that crime doesn't pay.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.782
I think Venus already realizes that,
Chief O'Hara...

16:30.949 --> 16:32.784
...and she isn't exactly caught.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.871
She has volunteered
to help us track down Joker.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.873
And she's taking a big risk too.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.210
- Because if the Joker ever got a hold of her...
- You're right.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.504
'Tis a fine thing you're doing, lass.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.048
I can give you my assurance, young lady.

16:46.215 --> 16:49.468
The authorities will take this into consideration
at your trial.

16:49.635 --> 16:53.847
I just wish I knew what Joker planned
for his next crime.

16:54.306 --> 16:57.434
There are only three signs of the zodiac left.

16:57.601 --> 17:03.273
Capricorn, the Goat, Aquarius,
the Water Bearer, and Pisces, the Fish.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.276
Let's see, Capricorn is--

17:06.443 --> 17:07.694
Wait a minute.

17:07.861 --> 17:12.156
Isn't there a meeting of the International
Society of Zoologists in Gotham City?

17:12.782 --> 17:16.954
Sure. And they're using one of the park
fountains to display their tropical fish.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.539
Precisely, Robin.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.290
Pisces, the Fish.

17:20.457 --> 17:23.877
In particular, Palaremus Demnese...

17:24.044 --> 17:27.839
...of which there are only two living specimens
left in the entire world.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.008
Both being displayed in that park fountain.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.637
- I think we'd better get right over there.
- Can I come along, Batman?

17:33.804 --> 17:39.518
I won't mind going to prison
if I know I've helped put the Joker there too.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.437
When you put it that way, my dear,
we could hardly refuse.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.290
What a magnificent geronimus, Dr. Gorly.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.834
Beautiful.

18:04.167 --> 18:09.673
And that is the finest specimen of valperima
I have ever seen.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.759
- But look over there, Dr. Gorly.
-Ugh.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.679
How hideous. What is it?

18:15.846 --> 18:17.681
A goldfish. Ach.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.897
Ah! But look over there.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.234
The prize of the zoological world.

18:29.401 --> 18:32.321
<i>Palaremus Demnese.</i>

18:32.487 --> 18:34.656
Exquisite, exquisite.

18:42.372 --> 18:46.043
- You must be Dr. Gorly of the society.
-Yes. A pleasure to see you, Batman.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.838
A pity more of our citizens
do not take an interest in science.

18:50.005 --> 18:54.009
I'm afraid we're going to have to move
your fish, especially the Palaremus Demnese.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.260
Ah!

18:55.427 --> 18:57.304
You know about the Palaremus.

18:57.471 --> 19:02.309
Unfortunately, so does a certain
master criminal who's plotting to steal it.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.270
Steal the Palaremus?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.649
That music.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.150
The Joker.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.454
Look out, Batman.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.501
Holy red snapper, Batman.
They're throwing fish at us.

19:33.382 --> 19:37.761
Into my net, you lovely little Palaremus.
Oh, ha-ha-ha!

19:37.928 --> 19:41.056
The fishnapping of the century. Ha-ha-ha!

19:41.223 --> 19:44.142
Careful you don't get caught
by a red herring, Batman.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.269
Let us away.

19:53.110 --> 19:54.695
To the Batmobile.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.904
Be careful, Batman.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.199
Don't worry, Venus.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.202
Don't let them catch you from behind.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.332
Good advice, desertress.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.727
Keep your head down, Robin.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.771
And keep your hands inside the car.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.192
They're heading for the warehouse.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.194
And so are we.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.448
These bullets are getting too thick.
We'll have to take a detour.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.794
Our two fish are about to rise to the bait.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.838
Everybody, get out of sight.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.703
- Something's fishy here, Batman.
- Ha!

21:26.870 --> 21:28.789
Beautiful, Boy Beanhead.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.834
I couldn't have made a better pun myself.
Ha-ha-ha.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.086
Look out, Robin.

21:35.796 --> 21:39.174
Well, what species have we here?

21:39.341 --> 21:44.387
Oh! It looks like Dynamicus Duos,
a rare breed of caped fish.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.848
- How about a fish fry?
-Ooh!

21:47.015 --> 21:48.475
I have an even better idea.

21:48.642 --> 21:53.230
Let's feed our fish to the fish. Ha-ha-ha!

21:53.396 --> 21:58.527
And don't forget,
we have a little bird as well.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.279
Batman, are you all right?

22:01.446 --> 22:03.406
Don't worry, my little pigeon.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.827
You'll be joining your friends for dinner.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.830
A three-course meal.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.100
Yes. Wasn't I right, Batman?

22:30.267 --> 22:33.478
A most appropriate place for a showdown.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.189
You monster.

22:36.356 --> 22:40.068
A monster perhaps,
but a highly-successful monster.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.697
With you and Robin out of my way
and my zodiac crimes completed...

22:43.864 --> 22:46.741
...I'll have all of Gotham City
under my control.

22:48.493 --> 22:51.079
Oh, and I'm a tenderhearted monster too.

22:51.246 --> 22:55.250
I couldn't possibly deprive
that poor, hungry clam of its dinner.

22:55.417 --> 22:59.504
That would be cruelty to animals, yes.
Ha-ha-ha.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.506
Very touching.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.800
Oh, Boy Wonder...

23:04.134 --> 23:08.805
...what a succulent hors d'oeuvre
you should make. Ha-ha-ha!

23:09.472 --> 23:15.270
Yes, and as for you, my ex-felonious friend,
let this be a lesson to you once and for all...

23:15.770 --> 23:19.524
...that honesty does not pay. Yeah.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.787
Oh, what a hideous fate.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.247
Don't lose hope, Venus.

23:34.414 --> 23:38.877
A clam is only a bivalve mollusk.

23:39.336 --> 23:40.545
Some mollusk.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.340
Push yourself away, Robin.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.344
I can't, Batman.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.262
I'm pinned against the side.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.433
Robin. Robin!

23:53.600 --> 23:55.018
Batman, he'll be eaten alive!

23:57.187 --> 23:59.940
Batman, help!

24:00.106 --> 24:03.485
Help, Batman! Help!

24:04.305 --> 24:10.357
