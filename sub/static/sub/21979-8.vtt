12:06.356 --> 12:08.658
Okay, not cool.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.793
Definitely not cool.

12:15.899 --> 12:18.401
So much for finding
a hidden pirate ship.

12:18.403 --> 12:21.637
Waste of time.

12:24.508 --> 12:24.841
Huh.

12:24.843 --> 12:28.444
Somebody's gotta be here
keeping those torches lit.

12:33.517 --> 12:34.684
Aah!

12:34.686 --> 12:37.320
Aw, sewer cakes.

12:38.522 --> 12:41.624
For all I know, this isn't even
the right direction.

12:41.626 --> 12:44.460
Boy, I really miss GPS guidance
right now.

12:44.462 --> 12:47.697
Whoa!
What the--?

12:48.632 --> 12:49.699
[grunts and gasps]

12:49.701 --> 12:52.368
You're gonna bring
the whole mountain down!

12:52.370 --> 12:54.403
Unless...
you don't care what happens

12:54.405 --> 12:59.842
'cause you're an apparition
from the spirit plane.

13:00.878 --> 13:03.813
(Donatello)
Whaah-ha!

13:06.216 --> 13:09.318
[chuckles]
I hate being right.

13:24.802 --> 13:25.535
Oh!

13:25.537 --> 13:28.738
Who's there?
Gah!

13:28.740 --> 13:30.740
Come out!

13:36.280 --> 13:39.515
Your camo is so weak, dog!

13:39.517 --> 13:40.616
[whooshing]

13:40.618 --> 13:41.350
Whoa.

13:41.352 --> 13:42.652
Either I'm wrong about the camo,

13:42.654 --> 13:45.955
or I'm about to fight
a ten-eyed monster.

13:48.659 --> 13:49.292
Oh!

13:49.294 --> 13:52.395
I was wrong about the camo!

13:52.629 --> 13:53.496
Keep 'em coming.

13:53.498 --> 13:56.399
I can do this all day.

14:01.738 --> 14:02.471
That's it?

14:02.473 --> 14:05.508
I still got more arrows, guys.

14:05.510 --> 14:06.542
Huh?

14:06.544 --> 14:07.443
(Leonardo)
Whoa!

14:07.445 --> 14:09.712
No.
No, no, no, no--

14:09.714 --> 14:12.515
No!

14:16.220 --> 14:17.220
Aah!

14:17.222 --> 14:22.191
Ooh!

14:22.193 --> 14:24.260
[grunting]

14:24.262 --> 14:26.229
Not as tough as I thought.

14:26.231 --> 14:28.931
[groans]

14:31.335 --> 14:32.902
Whaah!

14:32.904 --> 14:33.269
Ye-ah!

14:33.271 --> 14:35.104
Whoa!

14:35.106 --> 14:36.138
He-yah!

14:36.140 --> 14:37.974
[grunts]

14:44.047 --> 14:46.782
Ooh!
Ohh!

14:48.318 --> 14:50.920
Been a long time.

14:50.922 --> 14:52.054
Oh, man.

14:52.056 --> 14:53.189
Rahzar?

14:53.191 --> 14:54.290
- Good dog.
- [snarls]

14:54.292 --> 14:56.726
Easy.
Maybe I have a bone for you.

14:56.728 --> 15:02.231
Oh, you have many bones
I can feast on.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.000
[growls]

15:04.002 --> 15:04.400
Hi-yah!

15:04.402 --> 15:06.936
I would have been way more
into this spirit quest

15:06.938 --> 15:11.240
if I knew I'd get to
slap some Foot around.

15:14.211 --> 15:16.979
[grunts]

15:19.917 --> 15:22.251
Yeah!

15:22.253 --> 15:23.352
[bubbling]

15:23.354 --> 15:24.320
Huh?

15:24.322 --> 15:26.822
[bubbling]

15:26.824 --> 15:27.890
Aah!

15:27.892 --> 15:28.357
Haw!

15:28.359 --> 15:29.959
(Raphael)
Fishface?
Here?

15:29.961 --> 15:34.163
That temper fizzles fast
under water, doesn't it?

15:34.165 --> 15:35.831
Aah!

15:35.833 --> 15:37.333
Wah!

15:41.471 --> 15:44.240
[grunting]

15:44.242 --> 15:46.175
You want to bring
half the mountain down?

15:46.177 --> 15:49.211
[grunting]

15:49.213 --> 15:51.314
Fine with me.

15:52.816 --> 15:57.253
Ha! Hey, this Seishin syuyou is
way easier than I thought.

15:57.255 --> 15:58.220
[chuckles]
All it takes is

15:58.222 --> 16:00.256
a little quick thinking and--oh!

16:00.258 --> 16:02.258
We're just getting started.

16:02.260 --> 16:04.393
Let's see
how quick your thinking is

16:04.395 --> 16:08.264
when I smash your head
into the rocks.

16:08.266 --> 16:08.898
Tiger Claw?

16:08.900 --> 16:10.266
No, you're just a spirit, too.

16:10.268 --> 16:12.568
(Donatello)
You can't be real.

16:12.570 --> 16:13.436
[grunts]

16:13.438 --> 16:16.505
Does that feel real to you?

16:16.507 --> 16:18.341
Absolutely.

16:26.383 --> 16:27.049
What is it?

16:27.051 --> 16:28.918
What is your lesson?

16:28.920 --> 16:32.855
(Shredder)
Lesson?

16:32.857 --> 16:35.458
You've already failed.

16:35.460 --> 16:36.826
The Shredder.

16:36.828 --> 16:40.396
You are too weak to
stand without your master.

16:40.398 --> 16:41.430
He-yah!

16:41.432 --> 16:42.498
[grunting]

16:42.500 --> 16:45.034
(Shredder)
You can hardly stand at all.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.902
[grunts]
Aah!

16:46.904 --> 16:49.939
Aah-ha-ho!

16:49.941 --> 16:51.040
- Oh!
- [growls]

16:51.042 --> 16:52.041
Hey.
[grunts]

16:52.043 --> 16:52.875
Pause, pause!

16:52.877 --> 16:56.012
Oh!
Give me a second, spirit dude!

16:56.014 --> 16:57.346
Hee-yah!

16:57.348 --> 16:59.348
Hoh!

17:47.165 --> 17:48.330
(Michelangelo)
Okay, Mikey.

17:48.332 --> 17:49.532
What did Master Splinter say?

17:49.534 --> 17:54.570
Be still and calm
like the forest.

17:54.572 --> 17:55.905
[meows]

17:55.907 --> 17:57.006
Not now, kitty.

17:57.008 --> 17:58.040
Need to focus.

17:58.042 --> 18:01.143
If I concentrate,
I can beat him.

18:01.145 --> 18:02.478
Focus.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.913
Focus.

18:03.915 --> 18:06.582
[wind blows]

18:10.420 --> 18:12.188
Rahr!

18:13.557 --> 18:16.092
Wi-cah!

18:16.094 --> 18:17.193

[growls]

18:40.151 --> 18:41.517
Oh!
No.

18:41.519 --> 18:42.651
I gotta stand my ground.

18:42.653 --> 18:47.156
Immovable, right?

18:47.158 --> 18:47.690
[grunts]

18:47.692 --> 18:49.558
And they say
you're the smart one?

18:49.560 --> 18:54.230
I'm twice your size
and three times your strength.

18:54.232 --> 18:55.698
You will fall!

18:55.700 --> 18:59.635
(Splinter voice-over)
Be strong, like the mountain.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.470
[grunts]

19:01.472 --> 19:03.973
Aah!

Aah!

19:11.114 --> 19:12.548
[inhales]

19:12.550 --> 19:13.249
Breathe, Raph.

19:13.251 --> 19:14.016
Splinter is right.

19:14.018 --> 19:16.252
I need to concentrate

19:16.254 --> 19:20.556
and focus my anger.

19:20.558 --> 19:21.223
Sharpen it.

19:21.225 --> 19:24.994
Give it form.

19:24.996 --> 19:26.629
(Fishface)
Ready for another swim?

19:26.631 --> 19:32.535
I bet your toys
don't work so well under water.

19:32.537 --> 19:34.103
Aah!

19:34.105 --> 19:35.704
Eh?

19:35.706 --> 19:37.439
Ha!

19:37.441 --> 19:38.040
Eat it.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.543
(Shredder)
Your wounded leg is
like a ball-and chain,

19:40.545 --> 19:46.081
dragging you toward defeat.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.026
Shredder is right.

19:57.028 --> 20:00.062
My injury is always
gonna hold me back.

20:00.064 --> 20:01.230
I can't win.

Unless...
the pain is just in my mind.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.180

20:18.182 --> 20:19.248
It's not real.

It is time we end this, turtle.

20:38.269 --> 20:40.202
I agree.

Aah!

[grunting]

20:58.221 --> 21:02.157
[groans]

21:09.833 --> 21:10.833
I beat you on the spirit plane,

21:10.835 --> 21:16.171
and one day,
I'll beat you in the real world.

21:16.173 --> 21:17.706
I'm ready.

21:17.708 --> 21:21.277
If you know me into the mud
one more time, Red...

Oh?
What are you gonna do about it?

21:30.655 --> 21:31.787
What?
Nothing to say?

21:31.789 --> 21:34.790
Didn't think I could do it,
did you?

21:34.792 --> 21:35.324
Casey?

21:35.326 --> 21:37.760
What--?
Whoa.

21:46.202 --> 21:48.904
What happened out there?

21:48.906 --> 21:50.339
It's time.
