01:04.042 --> 01:07.292
[man] I'm told
I was a violent child.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.792
Usually to myself.

01:16.167 --> 01:20.208
Whether it was knockin' my head
against the wall or...

01:22.625 --> 01:26.083
mauling at my own fingers
till they bled.

01:30.792 --> 01:34.375
Anyone who got in my way
was fair game.

01:38.208 --> 01:41.708
I have this memory
of someone holdin' me.

01:42.417 --> 01:44.458
Just holding me.
Just fuckin' willing me

01:44.542 --> 01:46.125
to stop screaming.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.708
I don't know why I'm screaming.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.792
I can hurt people

01:56.875 --> 01:59.458
but there's no hate
in any of it now.

02:00.917 --> 02:05.250
Don't go thinking all violence
is the work of hateful men.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.000
Sometimes...

02:07.875 --> 02:10.792
it's just the way a fella
makes sense of his world.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.333
[knocking]

02:14.208 --> 02:15.333
[electric window opening]

02:15.417 --> 02:16.583
[man 2] Arm?

02:16.708 --> 02:17.917
Get in there and hurt

02:17.958 --> 02:20.583
that uncivilised fuckin' animal.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.083
Is he going
to make this awkward?

02:23.208 --> 02:24.208
[man 2] I don't think so.

02:24.292 --> 02:27.083
He knows it'll go easier
if he takes it.

02:27.708 --> 02:30.292
You know, but he's still saying
he didn't do anything.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.833
Sayin' he thought
the bed was empty.

02:33.708 --> 02:35.417
He's in there now
waiting for you.

02:35.958 --> 02:37.500
Look, I've locked his mammy
in the bathroom

02:37.583 --> 02:40.042
so she won't cause any bother.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.292
How easy should I go?

02:46.292 --> 02:47.542
[man 2] Well,

02:47.750 --> 02:49.500
don't kill him. [laughs]

02:51.958 --> 02:54.167
[voice on TV] Who said,
"To be sure, the dog is loyal.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.417
But why, on that account,

02:55.500 --> 02:56.875
should we take him
as an example?

02:56.917 --> 02:59.958
He is loyal to man,
not to other dogs".

03:00.167 --> 03:02.750
-Kevin?
-[Kevin] Martin Luther King, Jr?

03:02.875 --> 03:03.792
[buzzer sounds]

03:04.583 --> 03:07.792
-[deep sigh]
-[woman whimpering]

03:07.875 --> 03:09.083
[Presenter]
Are you scared, Kevin?

03:09.167 --> 03:10.458
[Kevin] Ah, bring it on.

03:11.167 --> 03:13.792
Watch out, Kevin.
You're in trouble now.

03:13.875 --> 03:15.375
How's things, Arm?

03:17.417 --> 03:19.667
I don't want to keep Mammy
in there too long, now.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.708
Fair enough, so.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.958
-[glass shatters]
-[grunts]

03:27.917 --> 03:29.542
[grunts]

03:33.458 --> 03:35.333
-[Arm] Up, Fannigan, look up.
-[coughs]

03:35.417 --> 03:36.458
Look up.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.417
[woman shouting and whimpering]

03:44.083 --> 03:44.958
[TV presenter] Correct!

03:45.083 --> 03:47.167
[cheering and clapping on TV]

03:47.250 --> 03:50.500
-[door rattling]
-[Fannigan coughing]

03:51.500 --> 03:55.000
[gasping] I didn't do anything!

03:57.000 --> 03:59.208
I didn't even touch her.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.000
All right.

04:03.042 --> 04:07.417
-[woman crying]
-[door rattling]

04:09.083 --> 04:12.042
[Presenter] Well done yourself,
Tom. You don't scare that much.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.083
You're the man of the match.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.292
[woman crying]

04:16.125 --> 04:18.750
[Presenter] Come over here now
before someone gets hurt.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.208
Thank you
to all our players tonight.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.375
[woman wailing]

04:26.458 --> 04:28.917
[man 2 laughing] My TV now.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.500
[Arm] Most people know to stay
on the right side

04:31.583 --> 04:33.333
of the Devers family.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.917
I'm what you meet
if you ever find yourself

04:37.958 --> 04:39.333
on the wrong side.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.125
But every now and then,
you'll come across a fella

04:42.208 --> 04:44.833
who just doesn't know
any better.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.042
[theme music playing]

04:47.083 --> 04:49.375
It wasn't always like this.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.625
I used to box.

04:55.750 --> 04:59.667
Dympna would rock up
with his seven sisters to watch.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.833
Watched me get
me eyelids ripped,

05:03.958 --> 05:05.708
the jaw broken...

05:06.500 --> 05:08.375
the nose broken.

05:09.292 --> 05:11.417
I never got knocked out.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.792
Dympna said,
"If you come and work for me

05:14.875 --> 05:15.917
and me two uncles...

05:16.958 --> 05:19.208
you'll never suffer
more than a scratch".

05:21.708 --> 05:23.083
I said, "Okay".

05:25.125 --> 05:28.375
He said, "You can come live
with me as well, if you want".

05:30.500 --> 05:32.042
I said, "Okay".

05:34.792 --> 05:37.167
People say they're trouble,
the Devers.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.333
But I say all families
have their problems.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.083
This is my family...

05:50.833 --> 05:53.792
and this is how we deal
with our problems.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.958
Last night, Dympna invited
the whole crew round

05:58.042 --> 06:00.750
for drinks
at the Devers family home.

06:01.458 --> 06:03.458
They were allowed to stay
the night if they drank,

06:03.542 --> 06:04.792
snorted or smoked away

06:04.875 --> 06:07.167
the means to get home
in one piece.

06:07.625 --> 06:08.750
Like they always had.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.500
Problem was,

06:12.667 --> 06:14.292
this time...

06:15.083 --> 06:17.958
Fannigan got
completely pig-eyed drunk...

06:19.917 --> 06:22.125
and when
everyone was sleeping...

06:22.958 --> 06:26.417
he wandered up to the bedroom
of Dympna's younger sister...

06:26.792 --> 06:29.625
and tried to climb
in under her sheets.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.167
Charlie was set
to turn 14 this week.

06:41.958 --> 06:44.792
The Devers don't care
about blood.

06:47.167 --> 06:49.958
They say
it only makes you related.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.917
It was loyalty.

06:56.292 --> 06:59.333
Loyalty made you
part of the family.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.375
[car tyres screeching]

07:02.625 --> 07:05.083
[car horn blowing]

07:06.500 --> 07:07.583
How do, Brando?

07:08.333 --> 07:09.542
You found a job yet?

07:10.083 --> 07:13.792
[Brandon] Grand. I'm the CEO
of this feckin' couch.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.875
[Dympna] Well, we've had
a sudden vacancy open up.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.000
You interested?

07:18.083 --> 07:20.417
No, I'm okay, man. Thanks, D.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.292
-Nice plasma, Arm.
-[Arm] Thanks, Brandon.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
-There's the men.
-[Dympna] Well, ladies.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.542
[chuckling]

07:33.208 --> 07:34.250
How's my little sis?

07:34.333 --> 07:35.917
-All right?
-Get off.

07:36.292 --> 07:37.250
[Dympna] Well?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.292
[woman] What's with the plasma?

07:40.375 --> 07:42.042
I thought Charlie might like it.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.625
Well, aren't you
the thoughtful one, Arm.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.917
I've already got a TV.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.958
Eh, say thank you.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.417
I don't want it.

07:58.125 --> 08:01.333
[Dympna] Okay, okay. [snorts]

08:03.750 --> 08:05.417
All right, I'm hungry.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.417
[Dympna] Arm, stick the TV
in your room or get rid, yeah?

08:24.917 --> 08:27.708
[seagulls screaming]

08:27.833 --> 08:29.583
[knocking]

08:34.457 --> 08:36.332
[woman sighs]

08:37.082 --> 08:38.292
How are you, Mrs. Dory?

08:38.625 --> 08:40.167
Douglas.

08:40.792 --> 08:42.375
Ursula around is she?

08:42.417 --> 08:44.082
She is, of course.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.250
Ah, sure look it,
I brought over a plasma.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.333
Who had to pay for that?

08:49.458 --> 08:50.458
-[laughs]
-[woman 2] Mam!

08:50.542 --> 08:52.833
It's all right. Just let him in.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.042
I won't have this one

08:55.125 --> 08:57.542
bringing stolen goods
into my house.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.208
Ah, fuck it.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.292
[Arm] How do?

09:10.583 --> 09:13.333
-[Ursula] Hiya, Douglas.
-[Arm] How's my boy?

09:13.542 --> 09:14.917
[Ursula] He's well enough.

09:16.958 --> 09:18.458
What's with the plasma?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.417
[Arm] For Jack.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.875
He doesn't watch telly.

09:25.292 --> 09:28.042
[Ursula] Are you listening?
He can't cope with it.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.833
[Arm] Ah, sure kids love TV.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.250
Stop that, you.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.875
[Arm] What's the craic, Jack?

09:36.333 --> 09:37.917
[groaning]

09:38.250 --> 09:40.375
Maybe he doesn't recognise you.

09:40.542 --> 09:41.500
Been a while.

09:41.583 --> 09:45.000
[imitating rocket engine]

09:49.333 --> 09:50.542
[Arm] Here.

09:50.583 --> 09:53.542
Go buy your mammy
something nice.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.333
A fuckin' sense of humour.

09:55.417 --> 09:56.833
[Ursula] Be with you
in a minute.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.083
[Arm] I was thinking I could
take monkey boy to the park.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.333
Down to the park?

10:02.375 --> 10:04.042
[Ursula] You won't get him
into his trousers.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.042
Ah, sure I'll take him
like this.

10:06.792 --> 10:09.333
Don't think Jack'll be
too bothered, will ya?

10:10.042 --> 10:12.667
I'm serious. Serious,
I'll take mine off as well.

10:12.917 --> 10:16.250
-Yeah, bit of solidarity there.
-[Ursula] Douglas, Jesus Christ!

10:16.833 --> 10:19.208
-[laughs] What are you at?
-[Arm] There we are now.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.917
[Ursula] He's going to see
the horses later

10:23.000 --> 10:24.250
so don't be gone too long.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.833
I thought you wanted me
to get him out of your hair

10:26.917 --> 10:27.500
for a bit.

10:27.583 --> 10:30.125
Eh, actually no, that's...

10:31.042 --> 10:32.708
That's not why I asked you over.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.083
[Ursula] It's good news.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.583
Jack has been accepted
into a new school.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.958
[Ursula]
A special education place.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.292
Right.

10:43.417 --> 10:45.208
And there's going to be
some costs involved

10:45.250 --> 10:47.375
so I just wanted
to let you know.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.250
[sighing]

10:50.000 --> 10:53.167
[Ursula] And well, if you're
able to contribute something,

10:53.542 --> 10:55.042
anything?

10:56.792 --> 10:57.833
You know, I hate asking

10:58.042 --> 10:59.625
'cause if I could afford
the fees myself,

10:59.708 --> 11:01.208
I wouldn't be fuckin' asking ya
to begin with,

11:01.292 --> 11:03.542
but I can't so there you go.
It's--

11:07.000 --> 11:09.083
It's a fantastic place,
really it is...

11:09.250 --> 11:10.750
perfect for Jack.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.792
What about the horses, though?

11:14.042 --> 11:17.208
Yeah, I mean, the horses help,
sure, but...

11:19.042 --> 11:21.208
Excuse me,
can I have that, please?

11:21.875 --> 11:23.458
But, eh... Can you

11:23.958 --> 11:25.375
put your fucking trousers
back on

11:25.417 --> 11:27.250
when I'm trying to talk to ya?

11:27.833 --> 11:30.250
[Arm] I was the same
at his age. A late developer.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.042
That's reassuring.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.667
I told you
I don't want the telly.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.042
[Arm] It's for Jack.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.417
[dog barking on TV]

11:43.500 --> 11:44.583
Sharp as fuck.

11:44.667 --> 11:45.583
Would you turn it off?

11:45.667 --> 11:47.292
-[wailing]
-[Ursula] It's all right.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.250
Would you fucking
turn it off, please?

11:49.292 --> 11:52.417
-[Arm] I'm fucking-- I fuck.
-Jack, it's all right, please.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.042
If I take the plug out
with the disc in it,

11:54.125 --> 11:55.167
-it fucks up the drive.
-Fucking take it--

11:55.250 --> 11:57.042
I don't give a shit.
Turn it off.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.208
-Fuck.
-[Jack screaming]

11:59.250 --> 12:01.667
[Ursula] Shhh, it's okay.

12:02.792 --> 12:04.833
-[Ursula] Make yourself useful.
-I fuckin' turned it off!

12:04.917 --> 12:06.417
[Ursula] I know
but open the door, please?

12:06.458 --> 12:09.750
-[Jack screeching]
-[Ursula] It's okay.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.000
[Ursula] You're okay, Jack,
you're okay.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.292
Shhh.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.125
-It's all right, Jack.
-[screaming]

12:17.208 --> 12:22.125
The TV's off.
The TV's off, Jack.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.333
Shhh.

12:27.542 --> 12:30.958
[theme music playing]

I'm comin' to get ya.

13:18.958 --> 13:23.000
[howling]

13:25.500 --> 13:27.000
All right, Dympna?

13:27.375 --> 13:29.417
[Dympna] Where are you, big man?

13:29.792 --> 13:31.792
-I got a call from Hector.
-[howling]

13:31.917 --> 13:33.208
Stop that!

13:33.958 --> 13:35.083
Stop that.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.417
Sorry, D.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.000
I said I got a call from Hector.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.667
You know, he sounded mad
but wouldn't say why.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.917
I think Mammy told him
about Fannigan.

13:43.208 --> 13:46.167
We need to swing by and see him.
Where you at?

13:46.250 --> 13:48.417
I'm with the young lad now.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.375
I asked where you at?

13:50.750 --> 13:52.208
The park.

13:52.958 --> 13:54.667
Over on Drummond Rise.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.375
All right, I'll see you in ten.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.083
Good man, Jack.

14:04.875 --> 14:08.500
[bass music playing on radio]

14:10.458 --> 14:12.000
-That one's Ursula's road.
-Yeah.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.583
-We're not dropping Jack home?
-No, no time for that.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.292
[mobile vibrating]

14:20.000 --> 14:22.417
Don't answer that, whatever
you do. Don't answer that.

14:22.542 --> 14:23.792
[disconnect beep]

14:24.333 --> 14:25.417
She's after money.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.917
It's some special school

14:26.958 --> 14:28.958
for the young lad there,
you know.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.167
So...

14:30.542 --> 14:32.417
look it, maybe it's something
we can talk about

14:32.500 --> 14:33.750
at some point, you know.

14:33.833 --> 14:34.833
Arm, mark my words,

14:34.917 --> 14:36.125
listen to me
when I say this, yeah?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.208
She will take you for
a fuckin' ride if you let her.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.917
Personally, I care for you
too much to see anyone,

14:41.958 --> 14:44.292
anyone take advantage of ya.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.750
She's a fucking fake, her.

14:45.917 --> 14:47.875
She knows how much
you care about him.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.042
Just wise up, here.
Wise up, Arm.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.208
-Wise up?
-Yeah, wise up.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.958
[engine roaring]

15:13.083 --> 15:17.208
[barking and snarling]

15:19.083 --> 15:20.625
[Dympna] Fucking dogs.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.875
-[car door opens]
-Leave the kid here, yeah?

15:28.125 --> 15:29.833
-[Jack moaning]
-[Arm] You're all right.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.708
[Arm] Just stay here.
Just play with something.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.417
I'm just going round the corner
to talk to the nice man, now.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.250
[Dympna] Arm! Fucking hurry.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.333
You're late.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.500
[Hector] Let's make this quick.
Maire's waiting for me.

15:44.458 --> 15:48.708
[Dympna] That widow of yours.
She is one lucky lady. [laughs]

15:50.042 --> 15:52.000
We heard about this fella.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.333
[Hector] Eh?

15:56.208 --> 15:57.917
What's his name?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.042
[Dympna] Fannigan.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.208
-Mmm.
-Fannigan. Yeah.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.083
What he did to the young one?

16:05.417 --> 16:06.833
Yeah, she's okay.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.125
Took care of it.
Actually, it's taken care of.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.875
[grunts] Really?

16:12.583 --> 16:15.000
Well, I suppose
that must be the reason

16:15.208 --> 16:16.625
you chose not to tell us.

16:16.958 --> 16:19.250
She's a child, Dympna. A child.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.667
If you couldn't handle it,
you should have called us in.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.750
-It's fucking handled, okay?
-Is it now?

16:23.833 --> 16:26.125
-Yeah.
-I don't know about that at all.

16:26.417 --> 16:29.333
And Paudi certainly
doesn't know about that,

16:29.625 --> 16:33.542
and as far as he's concerned,
retribution hasn't even started.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.375
But I've convinced him
to step back for a while.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.042
Give you a second chance.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.125
To do what?

16:46.167 --> 16:47.958
To amend yourself.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.083
[Hector] We understand the Arm
here has given him a taste.

16:53.542 --> 16:56.333
But we think it's now time
to finish the job.

16:56.542 --> 16:58.000
No, we don't do that.

16:58.500 --> 17:02.250
Not into that sort of business.
You know what I'm sayin'?

17:03.958 --> 17:06.415
It's time to get
into that business.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.458
If you know what I'm saying.

17:10.915 --> 17:13.040
The muscle? Young Armstrong.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.790
If what happened to that child,

17:17.540 --> 17:20.000
happened to your young fella
outside...

17:21.833 --> 17:23.915
would you leave the matter
as it is?

17:25.375 --> 17:27.415
This is my business.
I'll fuckin' sort it,

17:27.583 --> 17:29.250
-you hear me?
-Your father, God rest him,

17:29.708 --> 17:31.875
[shouting] would never
have let it end there.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.458
He'd be ashamed to see

17:33.583 --> 17:35.250
what you're doing
to the Devers name.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.167
Heh? He'd be embarrassed of you.

17:37.792 --> 17:40.000
[Hector] If you can't control
your side,

17:40.083 --> 17:42.083
everything falls apart.

17:42.167 --> 17:43.667
And we're done.

17:45.958 --> 17:48.167
How much does Fannigan know
about us, ha?

17:48.250 --> 17:50.083
About our end of the operation?

17:50.375 --> 17:51.958
[whispering] This is simpler
than you think.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.042
Get that half-wit to do it.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.542
Sort this out, nephew.

18:00.958 --> 18:01.917
For all our sakes.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.875
Well, what do you think
you're gonna fucking do?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.042
[grunts]

18:07.542 --> 18:09.833
What we shouldn't have to.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.000
Look what I found?

18:24.792 --> 18:26.417
[man] I think the little lad
was getting scared

18:26.500 --> 18:27.958
out there by himself.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.958
All that screamin'
and shoutin' going on.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.208
What you been up to now, ha?

18:32.833 --> 18:35.250
We took care of it.
We're taking care of it, Paudi.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.500
We came in to investigate,
didn't we?

18:38.583 --> 18:39.500
[moans]

18:39.583 --> 18:41.208
What's that? Ha?

18:41.792 --> 18:44.125
-[tense music playing]
-What are you saying?

18:44.250 --> 18:45.708
[Paudi] I can't make
head nor tail

18:45.792 --> 18:48.208
of what this fella's saying.
What's he on about?

18:49.125 --> 18:51.333
Just, eh... quiet.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.292
Quiet?

18:55.625 --> 18:57.333
The quiet man.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.292
Just like his daddy.

19:00.083 --> 19:01.083
If you grow up

19:01.167 --> 19:03.917
to be big and strong
like your daddy,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.333
maybe you can come
and work for me.

19:06.542 --> 19:08.167
But be warned...

19:08.583 --> 19:10.125
if you step out of line,

19:10.375 --> 19:12.750
I'd have to come along
and I'd have to--

19:12.917 --> 19:15.667
I'd have to cut
your little nose off.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.292
[laughs]

19:18.042 --> 19:22.542
And I'd have to come
and cut off your little ear.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.833
[Paudi laughs]

19:24.917 --> 19:26.167
As long as you're a good boy,

19:26.458 --> 19:28.417
there's nothing to worry about.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.125
Yeah?

19:33.125 --> 19:34.500
Isn't that right, Dympna?

19:36.417 --> 19:37.917
Yeah.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.083
I'll have to be getting him back
to his mother now...

19:46.333 --> 19:47.792

20:44.083 --> 20:45.875
I lost track of time, sorry.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.500
Don't you ever let him near

do ya hear me?

20:49.542 --> 20:51.375

-You take him

you're going to take him

him for one second, please?

21:12.875 --> 21:13.833
Come over here.

21:13.917 --> 21:16.125
Just fucking come up here
and talk to me now.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.542
-What?
-Come on.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.708
-Come up and fucking talk to me.
-What about?

21:22.417 --> 21:24.292
We need to talk
about the school.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.833
Not now, Urs.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.542
The school's in Rochestown.

21:29.583 --> 21:32.000
Where the fuck's Rochestown?

21:32.750 --> 21:34.250
Cork.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.500
Cork?

21:40.417 --> 21:41.750
Will they have horses
in Cork too?

21:41.833 --> 21:45.000
No, they have better support
for Jack.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.250
Let's be honest, now.
This is all about you.

You're a fake.

how much I care about the boy

21:57.500 --> 21:59.958
-and you're just trying--
-How fuckin' dare ya?

22:00.417 --> 22:02.375
If anything, this is about you.

22:02.917 --> 22:06.417
I don't want him
to be around you...

steal the lad.

Can she do that?

multiple goldfishes.

It's the animals cruelty.

with the guinea pigs.

Come on, boy, eh?

25:49.125 --> 25:51.417
Yeah? Let's go now.

25:52.375 --> 25:54.125
Fuck the lot of ye, yeah?

25:56.125 --> 25:57.750
[Dympna] Hey, it's not like
they were going to fuckin'

25:57.833 --> 25:58.875
call the Guards, is it?

25:58.917 --> 26:00.417
Like, even if they did,
even if they did,

26:00.500 --> 26:02.583
what the fuck
are the Guards going to do?

26:02.708 --> 26:03.833
Useless cunts.

26:04.083 --> 26:05.458
You know, if only the Gardaí

26:05.583 --> 26:07.292
would be a bit more Perry Mason
with me,

26:07.375 --> 26:10.417
who knows? But... anyways...

26:11.875 --> 26:13.333
Here.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.958
[snorts]

26:16.292 --> 26:18.000
Yeah, all right?

26:21.083 --> 26:23.083
Which one was Perry Mason again?

26:23.542 --> 26:26.292
The lawyer fella in Los Angeles,
what's the...

26:27.042 --> 26:29.750
Was he not the fella
in the wheelchair?

26:30.417 --> 26:32.375
You're thinking of Ironside.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.708
-Ah...
-Ah...

26:33.875 --> 26:34.958
I am, sure.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.250
Ah...

26:36.333 --> 26:37.333
What was his name?

26:37.500 --> 26:39.667
-Who, Ironside?
-Yeah, Ironside.

26:40.292 --> 26:41.708
Ironside.

26:42.708 --> 26:44.167
Yeah, Ironside.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.708
That's the character's name,
Ironside.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.250
-The main character.
-Yes!

26:52.625 --> 26:54.500
[laughing] The fella-- The fella
in the wheelchair?

26:54.583 --> 26:55.500
Yes!

26:55.750 --> 26:56.833
I don't know
why the fuck you'd name

26:56.917 --> 26:58.833
a wheelchair-bound
fella Ironside, but--

26:58.917 --> 27:00.500
You're supposed to say,

27:00.917 --> 27:03.250
"wheelchair user" now.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.333
Fuck you
and your wheelchair user.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.667
[laughing]

27:10.542 --> 27:13.250
[groans] Fuck them, anyways.

27:15.417 --> 27:16.708
The wheelchair-bound?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.792
No, fucking Hector and Paudi,
Arm.

27:19.958 --> 27:22.542
-Wake up, here. Take it.
-Fuck off.

27:22.625 --> 27:23.958
-Take the fuckin' thing.
-No, I'm all right.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.292

27:25.375 --> 27:28.042
-Come on.

27:29.875 --> 27:30.875
That's it.

27:31.542 --> 27:34.417
Yeah, well he just won't let
this fuckin' Fannigan thing go.

27:35.167 --> 27:37.042
They're not letting it go.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.250
Hector's one thing...

27:40.083 --> 27:42.125
Paudi's a different breed.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.125
Paudi is a different breed.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.458
Here we go.

27:51.625 --> 27:54.250
-Fuck off. No!
-To the two bros.

27:54.292 --> 27:56.000
-No, I'm all right.
-We're bros, ha?

27:56.375 --> 27:59.500
Come on, take it.

27:59.708 --> 28:03.625
Hey! [growling]

28:05.375 --> 28:08.125
Yay, there's a good boy, eh?

29:15.875 --> 29:17.375
-Urs?
-Jesus Christ!

29:17.542 --> 29:19.375
You're not with Jack.

29:19.417 --> 29:20.500
Did you not see him?

29:20.958 --> 29:23.042
Wasn't he tethered
to a lamp post outside?

29:23.667 --> 29:26.333
He's with me mam.
Is that all right with you?

29:26.417 --> 29:29.208
-I suppose.
-You suppose.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.958
Suppose you leave us alone, now?

29:32.583 --> 29:33.917
You're the horse fella.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.625
You could say that.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.375
This is Douglas.

29:38.458 --> 29:39.958
Jack's daddy.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.708
[man] Right.
Well, Jack's a lovely kid.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.792
Ursula too, right?

29:49.875 --> 29:51.333
What's your name?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.208
Sorry. Rob.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.250
That's some fucking accent
you have there, Rob.

29:56.333 --> 29:57.708
[Rob laughs]

29:58.417 --> 30:00.458
So, why aren't you at home, Rob?

30:00.542 --> 30:01.833
Well, part of my Masters

30:01.917 --> 30:04.208
involves work placements
and that.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.417
-And you chose to come here?
-[Rob] Not exactly.

30:09.500 --> 30:10.667
[chuckling]

30:10.917 --> 30:13.083
I was at a place
in Cork for a while.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.417
-Rochestown.
-Rochestown.

30:18.167 --> 30:19.792
Yeah, Rochestown.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.208
[Rob]
They have a great school there.

30:21.292 --> 30:23.167
Especially on the
psychotherapy side.

30:23.250 --> 30:25.083
Well, I guess after a while,

30:25.208 --> 30:27.625
I needed a change.
You know how it is.

30:27.750 --> 30:31.417
So, I put in a transfer request
and, eh... [Rob's voice fades]

30:32.208 --> 30:33.792
they sent me here.

30:34.292 --> 30:36.000

30:56.583 --> 30:58.250
And yourself, Douglas?

30:58.875 --> 31:01.250
What does a guy in his prime
do around here?

31:02.167 --> 31:03.583
I'm retired.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.125
[Rob] Retired?

31:06.833 --> 31:08.292
Douglas used to box.

31:08.750 --> 31:11.042
-Hey.
-Yeah, he was-- He was...

31:11.292 --> 31:12.417
great.

31:13.083 --> 31:16.333
He represented the county
in amateur at one stage.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.042
That's fucking great, man.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.333
[Rob] How come you gave it up?

31:24.375 --> 31:26.125
I killed a fella.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.292
[Dympna] What's the craic,
Ursula? [laughs]

31:36.375 --> 31:38.333
Who's this handsome cunt?

31:38.917 --> 31:41.250
Glad to see your business
is going well.

31:41.917 --> 31:45.125
[Dympna] Yeah.
Give Jack a hug for me, yeah?

31:45.250 --> 31:46.292
Bye, Rob.

31:46.542 --> 31:47.833
[Dympna] Bye, Rob.

31:49.125 --> 31:50.833
Jeez, you're a fucking mess.
Will you come on?

31:51.083 --> 31:52.000
[Dympna] Sorry, lads,

31:52.250 --> 31:54.875
I think he's going to puke
there, you know? Thanks.

31:54.917 --> 31:58.708

[exhales]

32:01.958 --> 32:03.125
What?

32:03.333 --> 32:05.792
There's one thing left to do,
buddy.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.208
We have to do it.

32:08.917 --> 32:11.250
We need to sort this tonight.

32:11.292 --> 32:13.792
If we leave it any longer...

32:14.667 --> 32:15.875
we're gone.

32:16.417 --> 32:19.833
Not Fannigan. Us. We're gone.

You know the money thing
we were talking about?

32:27.417 --> 32:29.958
-What money?
-For Jack! For Jack!

32:31.625 --> 32:35.500
Get him whatever you want.
I'll get you whatever you want.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.500
-[mumbles]
-You follow him home,

32:58.708 --> 33:00.458
past the cliffs, ha?

33:00.583 --> 33:02.125
Past the cliffs...

33:02.667 --> 33:05.500
You make it look
like he did it himself.

33:06.583 --> 33:08.833
You make it look like

I hope you knew
they always would.

41:37.542 --> 41:38.792
[Rob] You're a natural.

41:38.917 --> 41:40.375
[Ursula] Very good.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.917
[Rob] There you go. You got it.

41:49.083 --> 41:50.375
[Rob] Just like that.

41:52.583 --> 41:54.042
[Rob] You good?

41:57.292 --> 42:00.083
[crows cawing]

42:05.583 --> 42:07.708
[Rob] That's it. Stay relaxed.

42:11.708 --> 42:13.792
[Rob] Yes, that's it. Well done.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.625
Well, hello again.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.708
So what is it you're after now?

42:19.292 --> 42:21.500
I wanted to see
Jack ridin' a horse.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.292
Yeah.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.000
There you go. [sighs]

42:26.208 --> 42:28.042
-[Rob] Come on.
-[Ursula] Hiya.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.625
You disappeared off last night.

42:36.083 --> 42:37.458
Ha?

42:37.542 --> 42:38.583
[grunts]

42:42.208 --> 42:44.292
You were doin' grand without me.

42:44.417 --> 42:46.167
[Rob] Come on. Let's go.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.083
[Ursula] Well done, Jack.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.250
Hiya.

42:51.792 --> 42:54.208
-[Ursula] That was very good.
-Great.

42:54.750 --> 42:56.333
-[Ursula] You were very good.
-[Rob] Session finished

42:56.417 --> 42:58.083
a while ago, Douglas.

42:58.458 --> 43:00.625
I've got a retirement group
coming in now.

43:01.458 --> 43:03.583
Well, I am retired, right?

43:07.000 --> 43:08.333
Do you want to touch her?

43:08.417 --> 43:09.333
Do you mind?

43:09.458 --> 43:10.750
Go for it.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.333
It's easy.

43:13.917 --> 43:16.208
-[whinnying]
-Come on.

43:20.042 --> 43:21.792
-Yeah?
-Yeah, go for it.

43:22.833 --> 43:24.208
There you go.

43:24.708 --> 43:26.042
[Arm grunts]

43:26.250 --> 43:27.958
Why don't you have a go?

43:28.333 --> 43:29.708
I'm all right.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.375
Rob will look after you.

43:34.750 --> 43:36.417
Yeah, if you want.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.042
[Ursula] Go on.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.875
Bet you're just as good
as any of the kids.

43:41.042 --> 43:42.583
Go on, show Jack.

43:44.417 --> 43:45.792
[Arm] Ah, fuck it.

43:47.333 --> 43:48.333
There you go. Look.

43:48.417 --> 43:50.125
-[block scraping]
-[Arm exhales]

43:50.375 --> 43:52.708
-Just stand on the block.
-Right, yeah?

43:52.833 --> 43:55.333
-[Rob] Grab hold of the mane.
-Fuck. It twitched.

43:56.458 --> 43:57.833
-The mane?
-[Rob] Yeah.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.750
-Throw your leg over.
-[Arm] Won't hurt it?

43:59.833 --> 44:01.542
-Not at all.
-[Arm] The horse?

44:01.708 --> 44:02.917
[Rob] No.

44:03.292 --> 44:04.583
Go for it.

44:05.250 --> 44:06.708
-There you go.
-Fuck.

44:06.875 --> 44:08.708
-[Arm] All right. I'm up.
-[Rob] Good girl.

44:08.958 --> 44:10.708
[giggling]

44:12.625 --> 44:13.917
Jack! [chuckles]

44:14.250 --> 44:15.875
-[Rob] You all right?
-You know, I think so.

44:15.958 --> 44:17.500
Not so sure
about my nuts though.

44:17.833 --> 44:19.250
-All right.
-[Rob] There you go.

44:19.333 --> 44:20.958
-[whinnying]
-[Arm] Shit!

44:21.125 --> 44:22.333
[Rob] Whoa, whoa.

44:22.417 --> 44:23.333
[Arm] Oh, fuck.

44:23.458 --> 44:25.417
-Let's go for a walk.
-What the fuck do I do now?

44:25.458 --> 44:27.042
[Arm] Holy shit and fuck.

44:27.250 --> 44:28.250
[Arm] I can hold the hair?

44:28.333 --> 44:29.375
-[Rob] Yeah.
-[Arm] Yeah?

44:30.208 --> 44:31.917
[Rob] Yeah, she won't mind.

44:32.542 --> 44:33.625
[Rob] Yeah, it's pretty easy.

44:33.750 --> 44:35.333
-[Jack giggles]
-[Rob] It's like ridin' a bike,

44:35.417 --> 44:36.875
but without a bike.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.667
[Arm] A fuckin' hairy bike.

44:40.375 --> 44:42.417
[Rob] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:43.042 --> 44:44.750
[Arm] What do you mean,
whoa? What?

44:44.875 --> 44:46.250
[Rob] You want to take
the reins?

44:46.458 --> 44:48.167
-[Arm] Reins?
-[Rob] Yeah.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.208
Here.

44:51.417 --> 44:52.333
Jack!

44:52.417 --> 44:55.083
-[Ursula and Jack chuckling]
-[Rob] Come on, let's go.

44:58.333 --> 44:59.208
[Rob] Right rein.

44:59.458 --> 45:01.542
There you go. We're gonna go
straight down here.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.958
Look at your daft daddy.

45:05.500 --> 45:11.375
[theme music playing]

45:14.125 --> 45:15.875
-[waitress] Here.
-Thanks.

45:22.958 --> 45:24.167
Go on.

45:35.292 --> 45:38.167
So, are you planning
any more unscheduled visits?

45:39.250 --> 45:41.958
Didn't think
there'd be any harm to it.

45:44.292 --> 45:45.833
[Arm] Good boy.

45:48.208 --> 45:50.833
That's just Jack's version
of eating a burger.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.375
Would you pass the red sauce?

45:56.917 --> 45:59.500
Don't be smiling
like that neither.

46:00.167 --> 46:01.208
So?

46:01.417 --> 46:03.208
How are the plans coming along
for the big move?

46:03.667 --> 46:06.583
Eh, actually I'm heading
down there for the day tomorrow.

46:07.583 --> 46:10.792
I've got an interview for a job
at the school.

46:10.917 --> 46:12.042
Classroom assistant.

46:12.750 --> 46:15.542
Unlikely I'll fuckin' get it,
now, to be honest, 'cause...

46:16.208 --> 46:17.417
but...

46:17.583 --> 46:19.083
if I did, it would, eh,

46:19.417 --> 46:21.417
cover the lion's share
of his fees.

46:21.917 --> 46:23.958
[exhales] Hear that, Jack?

46:25.667 --> 46:27.667
You'll have to call your mammy,
"Miss Dory".

46:28.500 --> 46:29.958
[Jack moans]

46:31.583 --> 46:32.583
[moans]

46:32.833 --> 46:34.333
I know you will.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.583
You do realise, though, I'm--

46:37.000 --> 46:39.500
I am thinking about
what's best for him in all this.

46:40.083 --> 46:41.292
[grunts]

46:41.500 --> 46:42.583
[Ursula] But no, you're right,

46:42.625 --> 46:44.250
I am thinking
of myself a bit too.

46:44.708 --> 46:46.500
I fuckin' hate it here.

46:48.333 --> 46:49.708
The looks I get--

46:50.875 --> 46:53.042
-The whispers.
-What do you mean?

46:53.500 --> 46:54.708
People...

46:55.375 --> 46:58.625
thinkin' that I'm somehow
to blame for the way Jack is.

47:02.417 --> 47:04.625
I know them Devers women say it.

47:05.167 --> 47:07.083
Ah, come on.
You can't really blame them,

47:07.167 --> 47:08.458
can you, Urs?

47:09.458 --> 47:10.542
What does that mean?

47:11.125 --> 47:13.917
Well, in a town like this,
there's nothing else to do.

47:14.208 --> 47:15.708
Do you really think
I would have smoked

47:15.792 --> 47:16.792
or fuckin' snorted

47:16.917 --> 47:19.000
or did whatever when I was
pregnant with our son?

47:19.083 --> 47:20.500
No, I meant gossip.

47:22.042 --> 47:23.375
-Right.
-There's nothing for them to do

47:23.458 --> 47:24.958
-but gossip.
-Okay.

47:29.792 --> 47:32.042
So, you need someone
to look after Jack tomorrow?

47:32.208 --> 47:33.125
I...

47:33.708 --> 47:36.625
Yeah, I suppose but I'm going to
leave him with my mam.

47:36.875 --> 47:38.458
Don't leave him with
that downcast cow.

47:38.500 --> 47:39.750
-Douglas?
-You know,

47:40.083 --> 47:41.708
they say dogs take on the traits
of their owners

47:41.792 --> 47:43.958
and Jack's smarter
than any pup, so...

47:45.833 --> 47:48.250
Just imagine what a
miserable fecker he'll grow into

47:48.333 --> 47:51.125
if you keep leaving him
with that pinch-faced...

47:51.875 --> 47:53.000
yoke.

47:53.125 --> 47:55.167
You know, you-- [chuckles]

47:55.250 --> 47:56.625
You only ever see her that way

47:56.708 --> 47:58.708
'cause you make her that way
with your...

47:58.917 --> 47:59.917
presence.

48:00.125 --> 48:02.000
-My presence?
-Yes.

48:05.958 --> 48:08.167
Never been told
I have presence before.

48:09.333 --> 48:11.583
You're so stupid, you know that?

48:13.417 --> 48:15.917
Look, let me take Jack tomorrow.

48:17.458 --> 48:19.083
I'll take him the whole day.

48:19.542 --> 48:22.292
Just him and me.
No Dympna, no Devers, no..

48:22.417 --> 48:24.500
No nonsense, right?

48:25.208 --> 48:26.917
[Ursula] I don't know. [sighs]

48:27.000 --> 48:29.125
I don't think you could cope.

48:29.417 --> 48:32.292
-It's not that simple.
-Let me show ya.

48:33.292 --> 48:35.042
Jack loves it here.

48:35.167 --> 48:36.500
[Arm] Don't ya?

48:37.208 --> 48:39.083
He still loves it here.

48:39.583 --> 48:41.417
Let me show you what I can...

48:42.958 --> 48:44.833
I can take care of him.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.833
I'm tryin', Urs.

48:50.792 --> 48:52.875
Won't be like last time.

48:53.333 --> 48:54.958
What would you do?

48:55.375 --> 48:57.750
Ah, we'll find some sort
of trouble to get into.

48:58.292 --> 49:00.000
-Won't we, Jack?
-[giggles]

49:00.458 --> 49:02.958

That's what I'm afraid of.

49:03.042 --> 49:04.708
All right, fine,
would you just--

49:05.083 --> 49:06.958
Just keep an eye on him,
will ya?

49:07.042 --> 49:08.375
[Ursula] And be patient.

49:08.417 --> 49:10.917
Yeah, I will do. [laughs]

49:11.667 --> 49:13.917
[laughs]

49:16.042 --> 49:19.208
You remind me of yourself
sometimes, you know that?

49:19.958 --> 49:22.792
-[Ursula] I miss you.
-[gulps]

49:27.167 --> 49:29.958
You know all this stuff
with the Devers, right?

49:32.708 --> 49:34.875
That's not you.

Hector's new widow,

A rake of cash.

How much
is a fucking rake of cash, like?

A rake of cash's a rake of cash,

Needles, fuck sake, man.

how much exactly

-No, I don't fucking know

for good old Heck

for a reason.

You don't go
to fuckin' Mexico though

from Ireland.

52:08.417 --> 52:10.083
Do you know? You don't-- I mean,

52:10.625 --> 52:12.917
the Yank fugitives do it
because of the border, you know,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.042
it's only over the border,
but like,

that's why-

52:58.458 --> 52:59.917

-Yeah.

52:59.958 --> 53:01.500
It is in Cork. [sniffs]

53:01.583 --> 53:02.750
I mean,

53:02.833 --> 53:04.667
makes more sense
than fuckin' Mexico.

53:04.750 --> 53:05.750
-Mexico--
-To be fair.

53:05.833 --> 53:07.000
It does make more sense,
to be fair.

53:07.042 --> 53:09.667
-Makes more sense.
-[cheering and clapping]

53:10.417 --> 53:12.083
Yeah, now, salutations

53:19.542 --> 53:20.917
[Hector] And to friends.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.542

53:23.667 --> 53:25.375

-[all laugh]

53:26.000 --> 53:28.875
Always been a good judge
of character, our Dympna, ha?

53:29.375 --> 53:32.417
Forget about the boys, Heck,
what about us bures?

53:32.500 --> 53:34.333
[Hector] Oh, no, the bures too.

53:34.417 --> 53:36.083
We couldn't do nothing
without the boys,

53:36.167 --> 53:38.333
and we couldn't do nothin'
without the bures neither.

53:38.417 --> 53:39.833
[girl] Fuckin' right.

53:40.167 --> 53:41.458

53:42.292 --> 53:44.417

53:45.917 --> 53:47.292

53:47.958 --> 53:49.500
Come on, girl.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.208
Come on.

53:52.708 --> 53:54.917
Go on, sweetheart,
your uncle's waiting for ya.

53:58.292 --> 53:59.792
[Hector] Good girl.

54:01.958 --> 54:04.500
[laughs] It's all right.
We Devers,

54:05.125 --> 54:06.458
have been through
some tough times

54:06.542 --> 54:08.083
and we've the scars to prove it.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.792
But we're out
the other side now, yeah?

54:11.042 --> 54:12.042
And we're here now,

54:12.292 --> 54:15.000
celebrating
young Charlie's birthday.

54:15.333 --> 54:17.500
So, I say, 'Fuck 'em all!"

54:18.458 --> 54:21.917
And let's tear the absolute arse
out of it. Slainte!

54:22.083 --> 54:23.208
[all] Slainte.

54:23.333 --> 54:26.000
[snorting]

54:27.750 --> 54:29.792
[Hector] Hoo... [sniffs]

54:30.083 --> 54:31.083
Ah.

54:31.167 --> 54:33.167
-[Dympna] It's good, huh?
-[laughs]

54:33.625 --> 54:36.250
I fuckin' love the pair of ye,
eh?

54:36.750 --> 54:39.375
Yeah. Good lads.

54:40.042 --> 54:41.833
[Hector] You're loyal skins.

54:42.125 --> 54:44.375
That's what you are, fuckin'...

54:45.333 --> 54:46.917
[Hector sighs]

54:47.167 --> 54:49.833
You did the right thing,
young Armstrong.

54:49.958 --> 54:51.625
Shhh, the fuck's sake.

54:56.375 --> 54:58.417
You did right by your family.

54:59.250 --> 55:01.125
[Hector] Tell me, now.

55:01.750 --> 55:04.708
Must have taken a lot to do
what you did, ha?

55:10.208 --> 55:11.875
I know.

55:12.083 --> 55:13.917
I know.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.125
Still...

55:16.500 --> 55:18.167
it had to be done, ha?

55:18.708 --> 55:22.542
We welcomed that man
into our home. Like took him in,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.417
treated him
as part of the family.

55:25.833 --> 55:28.000
We let that disgusting
piece of shit

55:28.083 --> 55:29.417
across the Devers threshold

55:29.500 --> 55:31.083
and what did he do?

55:31.417 --> 55:34.208
Now, we trusted him,
what did he do?

55:35.792 --> 55:38.167
[sighs]

55:40.042 --> 55:42.917
Paudi thinks you let Fannigan
off the hook.

55:46.542 --> 55:48.458
What do you mean?

55:51.875 --> 55:55.042
Paudi is of the opinion that
that man should have undergone

55:55.292 --> 55:57.917
a fair amount
of pain and sufferin'.

55:59.083 --> 56:01.000
He suspects that you were...

56:01.500 --> 56:05.250
perhaps a little too merciful
in your methods.

56:06.583 --> 56:07.875
He wants to see you.

56:08.083 --> 56:10.750
Hear it from the horse's mouth
as it were.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.958
He needs to have
his mind put at ease.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.417
[tense music playing]

56:18.042 --> 56:21.292
But that's just fuckin' Paudi,
right?

56:22.208 --> 56:24.375
[Dympna laughs]

56:27.792 --> 56:29.625
[laughs]

56:38.208 --> 56:41.542

56:43.458 --> 56:45.875
[children shrieking]

56:47.625 --> 56:49.250
What do you want?

56:50.417 --> 56:52.167
-This is Jack.

56:52.458 --> 56:54.333

-That's my boy.

56:54.833 --> 56:56.958

-Okay.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.375
[children laughing]

57:03.417 --> 57:04.750
Hey, let's play a game.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.417

57:06.500 --> 57:07.958
Candy floss.

57:09.333 --> 57:11.750
[Arm] Jack? Candy floss.

57:12.625 --> 57:14.375
A couple of words.

57:14.792 --> 57:16.042
Then you can go back

57:16.125 --> 57:18.167
to being normal again,
I promise.

57:21.042 --> 57:22.708
Promise.

57:26.917 --> 57:29.083
Fair play to ya.
Fuckin' take it.

57:34.833 --> 57:35.875

58:19.833 --> 58:21.542
[woman] Okay. There you go.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.542
-Your barrel's crooked.
-[woman] Sure, you'd say that.

58:24.625 --> 58:25.875
-[Arm chuckles]
-[woman] Good boy.

58:25.917 --> 58:27.167
[Arm] This one's

Gimme your hand now.

58:47.750 --> 58:50.167
Put your other hand around here.
That's it.

58:50.250 --> 58:51.917
[woman] You have to hurry up,

58:51.958 --> 58:53.958
Just give me a fuckin-- Sorry.

58:54.042 --> 58:55.875
The lad, he hasn't eaten.
Come on.

58:56.375 --> 58:59.917
[Arm] I don't need this today,
Jack. We're havin' fun.

59:00.458 --> 59:02.542

Douglas,
what's the matter with you?

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.625
You know what you said
the other day, Dympna,

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.250
about the money?

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:42.083
After Fannigan was done?

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.083
Really? Now? You want
to talk about that now?

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:45.625
We don't have time for it.
Come on.

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:46.875

I don't feel up to it today,
Dympna.

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.333
Sorry?

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:00.958
Maybe we could leave it
for today?

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:03.417
No, no, no,
there's no leavin' it.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:06.875
We've to go to the farm today,
yeah? Paudi's waitin' for us.

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.208

Douglas--

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:33.042
Douglas, what the fuck happened?

01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:34.958
You can't be around here now,
Urs.

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:36.333
You just left Jack.

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:38.292
-What did you do to him?
-It doesn't matter.

01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:39.292
It doesn't matter?

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:41.500
Look, I'll tell you everything,
right,

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:44.167
[stammering] but not here, eh?

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:46.167
You have to go.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:49.250
-I'm not goin' anywhere.
-Ursula, please.

01:01:50.042 --> 01:01:51.500
I'm going to make this right.
I'm going to make it all right.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.375
-So...
-[door opens]

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.417
I can't do it now.

01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:58.833
-Stop walking away from me.
-[Dympna] Let's go, big man.

01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:00.833
There's no fuckin' time
for this.

01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:02.833
[muttering] Fuckin'...

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.750
Douglas, I know something's
goin' on with ya

01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:07.333
and every part of me said
not to come runnin' after you

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:08.583
but here I am.

01:02:08.708 --> 01:02:10.250
[Ursula] Okay, I'm listening.

01:02:10.417 --> 01:02:12.542
-Just talk to me.
-[Dympna] Arm.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.542
Urs, go home.

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:17.833
This is not loyalty.

01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:19.042
It's servitude.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:21.208
-I told you to fuck off, you!
-Dympna!

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:25.833
[door opens]

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.542
Fuck.

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:33.542
Ah, go on then.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.708
-Go on.
-[Dympna] Let's go.

01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:38.792
Go traipsing off with this lot,
like you always do.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:41.667
I'd watch that plank in your eye
if I were you.

01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:43.833
[Ursula] What's it go to do
with you, June?

01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:45.917
[June] I won't have you
reproaching poor Arm here

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.125
for a minor lapse of judgement,

01:02:48.208 --> 01:02:49.542
when sure isn't it your fault

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:51.667
the child is the way he is
in the first place?

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:56.417
You've said what you wanted.
Had your little tantrum.

01:02:56.792 --> 01:02:58.208
Why don't you fuck off home,
sweetheart?

01:02:58.792 --> 01:03:00.417
-[Dympna] Let's go, big man.
-[banging car door]

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:03.708

That's a fine cunt of a day, eh?

Dog? Dog. Eh...

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:17.083
One of them's ate a wasp.

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:20.500
It's a habit they've had
since they were pups, you know?

01:04:20.958 --> 01:04:23.917
Think he must have ate one
that wasn't dead.

01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:27.250
His tongue's all fucked up
and he's wheezing

01:04:27.292 --> 01:04:30.417
and stuck lying down
since yesterday.

01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:34.958
Be a shame
to put such a loyal animal

01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:37.083
out of action, you know?

01:04:37.542 --> 01:04:40.375
Sure, as the good Lord himself
would say,

01:04:40.917 --> 01:04:43.167
"That's fuckin' that".

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.167
Well, fuck that goon Hector.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.125

his little bit of stuff
stuck away

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:05.417

01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:07.833
-Still out there, is he?
-Jesus Christ,

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:09.958

hmm?

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:20.292
We're fallin' fuckin' down
with loyal skins, ha?

01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:23.583

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:40.708

01:06:45.917 --> 01:06:48.125
Well, you took

[Paudi] Better late than never
I suppose, ha?

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:56.625
Sure, maybe a seasoned killer
like yourself,

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:59.417
you might be able to help me
with the pup, ha?

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.375

He's in a bad way

01:07:12.917 --> 01:07:15.333

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:31.542
Paudi? No.

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:32.833
[woman] Hector?

01:17:32.958 --> 01:17:34.333
Who's there?

01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:38.083
I'm comin' in, Heck.

01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:41.292
Whatever this is about,

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:44.333
we can go somewhere
and talk about it because--

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.750
Shhh.

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:58.542
An acquaintance of yours,
Hector?

01:18:01.167 --> 01:18:02.792
He is, by and by...

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.958
He's a friend
of a young relative of mine.

01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.708
[Hector] My nephew.

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:11.333
Douglas, Maire. Maire, Douglas.

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:15.708
He used to box for the county.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:19.708
The carriage would suggest so,
all right.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:22.458
Hector not tell ya
I was comin' over?

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.958
Well, now he did not.

01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:29.250
Sit down, please,
the both of you.

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:38.708
You have intruded right

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:42.083
into the middle of our nightcap,
young man.

01:18:42.583 --> 01:18:44.625
I was just about
to serve a toddy

01:18:44.708 --> 01:18:46.875
to Hector and myself.
Can I fix you one?

01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:48.250
A what?

01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:50.375
Do, dear, yeah.

01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:51.500
And, em...

01:18:52.167 --> 01:18:54.542
Cut us a few wodges of brack
while you're at it.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.292
[Paudi] Please.

01:19:02.375 --> 01:19:04.250
[whispering] Whatever you have
to say, say it low.

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:06.375
She's to be kept out of this.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.167
That brother of yours lost it,
the mink.

01:19:09.375 --> 01:19:10.708
Took a couple of pot-shots at me

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:12.458
as I was gettin'
the fuck out of Dodge.

01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:13.542
[stammering] Why--

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.833
Why would he do
something like that?

01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:20.333
[Hector] Arm?

01:19:22.667 --> 01:19:23.917
[scoffs]

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:24.958
Fannigan?

01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:27.000
The useless cunt
was supposed to disappear.

01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:28.708
[sighs] Jesus!

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.125
You fuckin'--

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:31.417
Settle down, man.

01:19:31.583 --> 01:19:33.333
You fucked this whole thing up.

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:36.042
I'm takin' this
old one's money, Heck.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.042
You're goin' to sit there quiet
and let it happen.

01:19:38.083 --> 01:19:39.958
No, you're gettin' outta here.

01:19:40.083 --> 01:19:41.667
It's only a matter
of time before--

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.250
Here we are now.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.083
Your toddy is not too strong.

01:19:50.417 --> 01:19:51.833
It only occurred to me
in the kitchen.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:54.042
You must have driven
across the country,

01:19:54.208 --> 01:19:55.958
and will soon be driving
back again.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.750
So I made it mild.

01:19:59.042 --> 01:19:59.958
Lovely.

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:02.083
So this lad
is not your relative?

01:20:02.542 --> 01:20:04.583
[Maire] I'm sure I know you
from somewhere.

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.958
[laughing] No, no.

01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:14.875
Can I ask
what the emergency was?

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:16.500
Yeah.

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:21.167
Eh, it seems there may have been

01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:22.792
an accident on the farm.

01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:24.375
-An accident?
-Mmm.

01:20:24.667 --> 01:20:27.625
We may have to go now, my dear.
Immediately.

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:29.750
-Hector, what's the matter?
-[glass rolls]

01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:31.500
Take another step yonder

01:20:31.583 --> 01:20:33.375
and I'll break
both your fuckin' ankles.

01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:35.250
[Maire] Oh, God in heaven!

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:37.125
He's bleeding.

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:39.833
Hector, what is this all about?

01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:41.458
Sorry, Maire,

01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:46.958
[panting] I'm in your premises
under false pretences.

01:20:47.417 --> 01:20:49.208
But if I am, then so too
is the sidling cunt

01:20:49.333 --> 01:20:50.708
in the jumper.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.750
-He's after your money.
-My money?

01:20:53.125 --> 01:20:54.250
That's not true, Maire.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.042
He has you wrapped
round his little finger.

01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:56.958
It's what his kind does.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:21:00.125
Just take the money if that's
what it takes for ya to leave.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:02.167
I am not
what he says I am, Maire.

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:04.792
-[glass shatters]
-Jesus God!

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:07.792
Just go and get the money.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.625
[mobile vibrating]

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:38.208
[Dympna] Arm? Hey, Arm?

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:43.250
-Dympna?
-[Dympna] Where are you, buddy?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.500
Where the fuck are ya?

01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:48.625
Okay, things got outta hand
back there, man,

01:21:49.042 --> 01:21:50.708
but it's all calm now, yeah?

01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:53.000
I got Paudi to calm down and...

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:56.792
I just need you
to come back in, man.

01:21:57.458 --> 01:21:59.750
Remember you're my bro, eh?

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:01.250
Ha?

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:03.875
You'll never see me again.

01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:06.042
I'm done. I'm leaving.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.000
You know
it doesn't work that way, buddy.

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:10.458
Not with him, ha?

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.083
You know,
Paudi's asking questions

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:14.458
about Jack and Urs.

01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:17.750
What do ya mean?

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:19.917
What I mean is...

01:22:21.542 --> 01:22:23.042
if I can't tell him
where you are,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.042
I'm gonna have to tell him
where they are.

01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:29.375
I don't wanna do that, man.

01:22:30.667 --> 01:22:33.042
You know what
he'll fuckin' do to them, eh?

01:22:36.583 --> 01:22:38.417
-[Maire gasps]
-No, Arm!

01:22:41.417 --> 01:22:43.792
-Oh, God!
-[Hector roaring]

01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:46.833
Do ya hear that?

01:22:46.917 --> 01:22:48.750
[groaning]

01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:51.125
You go anywhere near my Jack,

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.042
and Hector's dead.
Dead, you understand?

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:57.333
Is that where you been hidin'?
At the widow's, eh?

01:22:57.667 --> 01:22:59.458
I'm here all right.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:02.292
Arm?

01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:04.625
Arm, just stay there, yeah?

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.583
-No one else has to get hurt.
-You thick fuckin' daft cunt!

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.250
-[Hector] You fuckin' loaf!
- Arm?

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.208
[Arm] Now, get a move on.

01:23:12.375 --> 01:23:14.125
I'm sorry, Maire, please...

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:15.417
[Dympna] Fuck.

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.250
[Maire]
The money won't help you.

01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:21.167
[Arm] It's not for me. Hurry up!

01:23:22.958 --> 01:23:26.167
It's all in there.
Now, take it and go, please.

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:32.250
[Ursula's voice indistinct]

01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:40.083
-[Ursula] Douglas?
-[Maire] Douglas...

01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:41.750
...won't make it right.

01:23:45.083 --> 01:23:46.583
You're hurt?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.375
[Maire] Whatever mess
it is you're in, son,

01:23:54.833 --> 01:23:57.417
no amount of money
will make it right.

01:23:58.083 --> 01:23:59.500
Whoever you gave it to,

01:24:00.208 --> 01:24:03.375
you'll only be involving them
in all this.

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:06.167
[lid bangs]

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:10.292
[Arm groans]

01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:18.500
I can't...

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:20.292
I can't...

01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:24.417
I can't turn up with nothin',
you know?

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:27.917
Can't keep givin' them nothin'.

01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:34.333
[Maire] Wait.

01:24:35.875 --> 01:24:37.375
I know you.

01:24:38.792 --> 01:24:41.125
I thought I recognised you.

01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:43.292
[sighs]

01:24:43.375 --> 01:24:45.250
You're that boxer.

01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:49.333
I remember you from the papers.

01:24:51.333 --> 01:24:54.083
The way they talked about you.

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:57.542
You were only a boy.

01:25:01.792 --> 01:25:03.542
So was he.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.083
It's a hospital
we should get you to.

01:25:07.167 --> 01:25:09.833
-No.
-A doctor, at least.

01:25:09.958 --> 01:25:11.542
You have to think of the others.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:13.167
What others?

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:15.542
The people in your life.

01:25:16.292 --> 01:25:17.958
Your family?

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:23.458
Is this really
what they want from you?

01:25:28.083 --> 01:25:30.083
Stolen money?

01:25:34.417 --> 01:25:36.417
You've done nothing yet.

01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:40.083
Nothing that cannot be
turned back.

01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:45.625
[sighs]

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.958
No, it's too late.

01:26:00.458 --> 01:26:01.833
You're right.

01:26:02.417 --> 01:26:03.583
Right.

01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:07.625
But it's okay.

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:12.750
It has to be.

01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:23.250
[car door closes]

01:26:24.083 --> 01:26:26.083
[engine starts]

01:26:28.042 --> 01:26:29.208
[Maire] Hector?

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:32.083
He's gone.

01:26:33.958 --> 01:26:36.042
Now, I'm sorry, Maire.

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:39.875
You have to get out of here.

01:26:41.875 --> 01:26:44.000
Someone bad is coming.

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:06.750
[car engine starts]

01:27:07.917 --> 01:27:11.250
[soft piano playing]

01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:25.708
[grunts]

01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:29.083
[grunts]

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:32.458
[whimpers]

01:27:32.583 --> 01:27:36.583
[phone vibrating]

01:27:39.583 --> 01:27:41.250
[grunts]

01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:50.542
[phone vibrating]

01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:57.917
[call beep]

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:04.583
[Ursula] Douglas?

01:28:08.292 --> 01:28:09.792
Yeah, it's me.

01:28:10.667 --> 01:28:12.292
[Ursula] Yeah, what do you want?

01:28:12.458 --> 01:28:14.167
I got your message.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.667
Is everything all right?

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:18.500
[sighs] Fine.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.208
Fine, now.

01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:25.542
Right, so what do you want?

01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:28.333
How's Jack?

01:28:28.833 --> 01:28:30.333
He's fine.

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:32.792
He's asleep.

01:28:38.375 --> 01:28:40.792
[Arm] Maybe you could tell him,
tell him...

01:28:42.125 --> 01:28:44.375
Maybe you could tell him
I asked for him?

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:50.667
Sorry I haven't been around,
Urs.

01:28:51.083 --> 01:28:52.375
[Ursula sighs]

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:56.292
You're never out of me hair,
are ya?

01:29:02.167 --> 01:29:04.208
In a useful way.

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:08.583
A better way.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.083
You deserve better.

01:29:15.875 --> 01:29:18.250
[Ursula]
Everyone deserves better.

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:25.292
Maybe it should be the
other way around altogether so.

01:29:28.708 --> 01:29:30.458
[Ursula] What does that mean?

01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:32.708
Nothin'.

01:29:39.542 --> 01:29:41.292
Look, I'll leave you to it.

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.458
[Ursula] No... Douglas.

01:29:43.958 --> 01:29:46.792
- What does that mean?
- Nothin'.

01:29:48.667 --> 01:29:50.125
I mean...

01:29:51.667 --> 01:29:53.583
Ah, you'll have better.

01:29:56.958 --> 01:30:00.083
Soon enough, when you're out
of this fuckin' place.

01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:02.958
You'll find a way.

01:30:07.875 --> 01:30:08.792
[Ursula] Douglas?

01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:11.250
Now, you need to go
and do your thing.

01:30:12.208 --> 01:30:13.542
