WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.419
- NARRATOR: Tonight...
- It's picking up something.

00:03.578 --> 00:05.170
on<i> Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:06.831 --> 00:09.842
- Really?
- Have you estimated how much might be down there?

00:11.669 --> 00:13.670
- MARTY: Whoa.
- TED: This here is

00:13.755 --> 00:15.597
- your face rock.
- HOPPY: That means gold.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.267
MATTY: Everything's lining up
with Hoppy's theory.

00:22.847 --> 00:25.015
MATTY: I'm in now.
I want to dig.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.433
- Oh, shoot, it's a rattler!
- MARTY: Oh, geez!

00:26.517 --> 00:27.651
- Rick, get out of there!
- RICK: Whoa!

00:30.113 --> 00:31.780
All the while
we were growing up,

00:31.865 --> 00:34.867
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.036
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:37.120 --> 00:38.695
cursed treasure.

00:38.780 --> 00:40.706
Civil War gold.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.533
- (laughter) - Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:43.618 --> 00:45.794
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:45.879 --> 00:48.789
- Whoa.
- waiting to be explored.

00:48.873 --> 00:51.708
RICK: So, we like to reach
out to other treasure hunters.

00:51.793 --> 00:53.960
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.296
- MARTY: We want to hear their stories...
- That's right.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.715
- and share our insights.
- "Ill-gotten gains."

00:58.800 --> 01:00.217
- RICK: And who knows...
- GARY: I got it.

01:00.301 --> 01:01.968
maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.637
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.388
Wow. That is gold.

01:05.473 --> 01:07.307
- RICK: But all over the world.
- Yeah!

01:07.400 --> 01:08.901
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:19.570 --> 01:23.907
Well, here we are again, guys.
On another treasure hunt.

01:23.991 --> 01:26.493
Man, we are in Texas.
Look at that land.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.586
This is what you picture

01:27.745 --> 01:29.421
when you think of
this part of Texas, huh?

01:29.580 --> 01:31.006
Absolutely.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.842
NARRATOR: Just outside
Stephenville, Texas,

01:34.001 --> 01:36.086
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:36.170 --> 01:38.255
along with Matty Blake...

01:38.339 --> 01:41.341
are about to take part
in a new treasure hunt

01:41.425 --> 01:44.019
of Texas-sized proportions.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.438
Today we're going to
meet a guy named Hoppy, right?

01:46.523 --> 01:47.773
- Hoppy Eubanks.
- Yeah.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.518
I guess Hoppy Eubanks--
God, I love that name--

01:51.602 --> 01:53.854
Says he knows where to find
a lost Spanish mine

01:53.938 --> 01:55.114
of gold and silver.

01:55.273 --> 01:56.606
Well, good. I can't
wait to find out about that.

01:56.691 --> 02:00.702
I know the Spanish took
a lot of treasure out of Mexico.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.196
Did they take a lot
out of Texas?

02:03.289 --> 02:05.615
They were pulling a lot
of precious metal

02:05.700 --> 02:06.959
out of the ground,
right here in this state.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.618
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.712
When you look at history, right,

02:10.797 --> 02:12.956
the Spanish come
to the New World.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.885
- They're driven by a quest for territory...
- Yeah.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.462
and to garner wealth.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.715
And they conquered
the Aztec empire.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.726
Their lust for gold increases
by... exponentially, right?

02:24.811 --> 02:27.387
And so what's your
next step then?

02:27.471 --> 02:29.731
Your next step is
where did they get it?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.818
- We're gonna go mine for it.
- Yeah.

02:32.977 --> 02:37.573
NARRATOR: In 1519, nearly
three decades after Spain

02:37.732 --> 02:39.399
first began colonizing South

02:39.483 --> 02:41.568
and Central American
territories,

02:41.661 --> 02:46.740
conquistador and cartographer
Alonso Alvarez de Piñeda

02:46.824 --> 02:51.170
claimed much of present-day
Texas for the Spanish Crown.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.839
W.C. JAMESON: The Spaniards
came to the New World

02:53.923 --> 02:57.417
and saw the potential of
expanding their territory.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.511
They brought along their
scientists, their geologists,

02:59.670 --> 03:01.763
their mineralogists,
and engineers, because

03:01.848 --> 03:05.350
they had planned on
doing a lot of mining.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.270
FOLSOM: The Spanish were
enormously successful in finding silver.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.932
They set up these mining
operations, and something like

03:12.016 --> 03:14.517
two million pounds of
silver every year

03:14.602 --> 03:16.519
would be sent back to Spain.

03:16.604 --> 03:19.698
It actually became the focus
of the Spanish economy.

03:19.782 --> 03:24.703
JAMESON: A lot of the mining was
done by enslaved Native Americans.

03:24.862 --> 03:28.281
They were captured,
they were chained together,

03:28.374 --> 03:29.541
and they worked in the mines,

03:29.626 --> 03:33.370
sometimes 14, 16 hours a day
on poor rations.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.549
NARRATOR: The harsh treatment
at the hands of the conquistadors

03:37.634 --> 03:41.386
led to much resentment
among the indigenous people.

03:41.545 --> 03:45.307
Soon, the Spanish
and their mining settlements,

03:45.391 --> 03:47.142
were under constant attack
from the Apache,

03:47.227 --> 03:50.312
Wichita and Comanche nations.

03:50.471 --> 03:52.973
FOLSOM: The Spanish, a lot of
times, they would end up losing

03:53.066 --> 03:56.068
the location of these mines
because they start to work it,

03:56.227 --> 03:58.061
then you get the Apaches
or potentially Comanches

03:58.145 --> 03:59.404
attacking them.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.323
And they abandon the mine.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.991
And by the time they're able
to come back,

04:03.150 --> 04:04.910
once the violence has subsided,

04:04.994 --> 04:07.821
they've lost
the location of the mine.

04:07.905 --> 04:12.417
- Okay, so we're looking here for a lost mine.
- Yes.

04:12.576 --> 04:14.503
- I mean, I'm looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

04:14.662 --> 04:16.496
Hoppy believes that there's some

04:16.580 --> 04:19.249
rock carvings and some
other petroglyphs that

04:19.342 --> 04:22.168
show that the Spanish
were there.

04:22.253 --> 04:23.920
They mined extensively.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.265
And the location
of the mine was lost.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.592
So he's done an extensive amount
of work, and he has a pedigree.

04:29.677 --> 04:31.520
I mean, he's found other
treasure elsewhere.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.513
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.266
And he has hooked up with
a geologist and a geophysicist.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.777
- Good.
- So he's running real science,

04:38.861 --> 04:42.531
which has corroborated what
Hoppy has deduced,

04:42.615 --> 04:45.108
and the hope is that
we can, on some level,

04:45.192 --> 04:46.943
either clue them into
some new technologies,

04:47.036 --> 04:49.538
or assist them in
part of their discovery process.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.032
Yeah. Or maybe we might learn
something from them.

04:52.116 --> 04:54.209
- Or we might learn something from them. Absolutely.
- Yeah.

04:54.368 --> 04:55.869
MATTY:
All right, fellas, we did it.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.045
MARTY:
Here we are, we made it.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.631
This is so cool.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.551
I'm really looking forward
to meeting Hoppy Eubanks.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.303
I know he's made discoveries.

05:04.462 --> 05:06.546
I know he's a legitimate,
credible treasure hunter.

05:06.630 --> 05:07.630
He takes it very seriously.

05:07.715 --> 05:10.133
- Howdy, sir! I'm Marty.
- I'm Hoppy.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.394
Hi, Hoppy, I'm Rick.
Nice to meet you.

05:12.553 --> 05:15.221
So I'm excited to see what he's
found, and the evidence he has

05:15.315 --> 05:17.983
for where the actual location
of the lost Spanish mine is.

05:19.393 --> 05:22.145
Yes, please. Thank you.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.565
NARRATOR: Born and
raised in central Texas,

05:25.658 --> 05:27.075
Alfred "Hoppy" Eubanks

05:27.160 --> 05:29.661
worked as an aircraft
specialist for more than

05:29.746 --> 05:32.906
two decades after serving in
the United States Navy

05:32.999 --> 05:36.159
from 1960 to 1964.

05:36.243 --> 05:40.505
In 1971, Hoppy conducted
independent research

05:40.664 --> 05:43.842
and followed clues that
led to the discovery of

05:43.926 --> 05:47.670
an 18th-century chest beneath a
house in Fulton County, Georgia.

05:47.755 --> 05:50.256
Its contents, including
letters written

05:50.350 --> 05:52.092
during the Revolutionary War,

05:52.185 --> 05:55.520
were worth an estimated $50,000.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.515
Hoppy has hunted for
numerous missing treasures

05:58.599 --> 06:00.600
in the ensuing decades.

06:00.693 --> 06:04.446
But now, at age 81, he's focused

06:04.605 --> 06:08.691
on finding the location of
a legendary lost Spanish mine.

06:08.776 --> 06:11.203
Bereket, nice to meet you.
I'm Rick.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.196
All right.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.447
NARRATOR:
And supporting those efforts

06:14.532 --> 06:16.958
are geologist Curt Champlin

06:17.118 --> 06:20.045
and geophysicist Bereket Derie.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.714
We got a lot of questions.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.216
We want to find out
about you, Hoppy.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.220
Where did the bug bite you from?

06:29.380 --> 06:31.556
I see.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.558
It's in the blood.

06:40.057 --> 06:43.819
I see. Wow.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.489
I love it.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.200
So, Hoppy, tell us what you
think you've found here.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.657
- Wow.
- Really?

06:57.741 --> 06:59.334
That's pretty cool.

07:00.411 --> 07:04.840
NARRATOR:
On February 17, 1756,

07:04.999 --> 07:08.593
lieutenant governor of Texas,
Bernardo Miranda y Flores,

07:08.678 --> 07:13.423
left San Antonio with 23 men to
investigate reports of massive

07:13.507 --> 07:17.769
silver deposits in the hills
near the San Saba River.

07:17.928 --> 07:22.599
He was stunned by what he
found-- a site that would soon

07:22.683 --> 07:25.935
become one of the most lucrative
mines in the New World.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.612
FOLSOM: Bernardo de
Miranda is gonna claim

07:27.697 --> 07:30.365
that there's enough silver

07:30.450 --> 07:32.951
for everyone in Texas
to have a mine of their own.

07:33.110 --> 07:37.289
KELLY: The legend was that
the silver was so pure

07:37.448 --> 07:39.458
and so thick that you
could just scrape it off.

07:39.617 --> 07:41.877
And as it was mined,
of course, they would smelt it,

07:42.036 --> 07:45.130
and it would be made into
silver ingots.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.958
NARRATOR: For two
years, the operation thrived.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.378
But in 1758, some 2,000 men from

07:52.472 --> 07:54.973
the Comanche and Wichita nations

07:55.132 --> 07:58.393
carried out a coordinated
attack, burning the Spaniards'

07:58.478 --> 08:03.315
mission and the nearby
military fort, or presidio.

08:03.399 --> 08:07.310
Before their retreat,
the fleeing Spaniards reportedly

08:07.394 --> 08:09.488
covered up the entrances
of the mine to keep

08:09.572 --> 08:13.066
the abundant riches hidden
until they could return.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.654
That opportunity never came,
and the mine's exact location

08:17.747 --> 08:22.158
has remained a tantalizing
mystery ever since.

08:22.251 --> 08:26.338
So the San Saba mine...
it's a big operation.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.250
So, you think you
know where the mine is?

08:30.334 --> 08:32.177
Wow.

08:34.421 --> 08:35.305
Mm-hmm.

08:38.425 --> 08:39.684
- Do you?
- MATTY: Really?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.518
Could I have a look at that,
Hoppy? Thank you, sir.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.197
NARRATOR: Although "waybills"
are often defined as lists of goods,

08:52.356 --> 08:55.775
or passengers being transported
from place to place,

08:55.859 --> 08:57.860
in the world
of treasure hunting,

08:57.954 --> 09:00.697
the term has
a very different meaning.

09:00.781 --> 09:03.366
Waybills is just simply
several pages of directions

09:03.459 --> 09:05.710
going from point A to point B.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.381
Point B being the location
of the mine or the cache.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.133
Sometimes those waybills
are accompanied by a map--

09:12.293 --> 09:14.386
Often a crude map--
But in the end,

09:14.545 --> 09:17.389
fairly useful for
getting at least close.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.301
NARRATOR: Although its
original author is another mystery,

09:21.394 --> 09:24.563
Hoppy received this waybill
from a fellow treasure hunter

09:24.647 --> 09:26.314
more than two decades ago.

09:43.324 --> 09:46.418
- Okay.
- MARTY: Very cool.

09:46.577 --> 09:49.004
NARRATOR: After exploring
a location 70 leagues,

09:49.163 --> 09:52.665
or approximately 183 miles

09:52.758 --> 09:54.167
north of San Antonio,

09:54.251 --> 09:57.929
Hoppy was amazed to discover
a number of rock carvings

09:58.088 --> 10:01.424
that he believed could
be of Spanish origin,

10:01.508 --> 10:04.769
and possibly pointing
to the lost mine.

10:04.928 --> 10:08.273
To corroborate his theory,
Hoppy sought out some

10:08.357 --> 10:11.443
scientific help, utilizing
state-of-the-art imaging

10:11.602 --> 10:15.188
technology from
geologist Curt Champlin.

10:15.272 --> 10:19.117
CURT: We conducted three
resistivity surveys.

10:19.276 --> 10:21.527
And the first one that
we did conduct was showing

10:21.621 --> 10:24.873
an area that was an anomaly that

10:24.957 --> 10:28.293
we wanted to further
investigate that area.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.049
MARTY: Are we looking at
a cross section here?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.551
Okay.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.894
- MARTY: Okay.
- MATTY: Interesting.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.723
NARRATOR: Electrical
resistivity tomography-- or ERT--

10:50.816 --> 10:54.227
Works by transmitting electrical
current through the ground

10:54.311 --> 10:56.488
to identify
possible buried objects,

10:56.647 --> 10:59.074
voids or structures.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.988
Right.
You want to drill a well

11:06.073 --> 11:07.749
that proves that
there is a cavity there.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.084
Okay, well, do you have a spot
marked where you want to drill?

11:18.168 --> 11:21.754
- I think I want to go near this spot.
- MARTY: All right.

11:21.847 --> 11:25.091
Is the silver in an ore,
th-they think in this mine?

11:25.175 --> 11:26.101
Or is it...?

11:32.775 --> 11:33.858
- Oh.
- RICK: Oh, really?

11:35.769 --> 11:36.861
NARRATOR:
Smelters?

11:37.020 --> 11:40.356
Used to extract
precious metal from raw ore?

11:40.449 --> 11:42.117
Could this be further evidence

11:42.201 --> 11:44.452
that the Spanish were
engaged in mining activities

11:44.611 --> 11:47.038
in the area that Hoppy believes

11:47.197 --> 11:50.500
is the location of
the lost San Saba mine?

12:08.394 --> 12:11.813
Have you estimated how much
money might be down there?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.151
MATTY:
Wow.

12:16.310 --> 12:17.861
MARTY:
That's worth digging for.

12:22.649 --> 12:23.575
Wow.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.317
Okay, let's go get it.

NARRATOR:
In Stephenville, Texas,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.238
Rick and Marty Lagina,

12:29.323 --> 12:31.583
along with Matty Blake,

12:31.667 --> 12:34.753
are meeting with treasure hunter
Hoppy Eubanks and his team--

12:34.837 --> 12:36.746
Who believe they know
the location

12:36.830 --> 12:38.831
of the legendary San Saba mine.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.335
RICK: The thing with Hoppy
is, he's very enthusiastic.

12:42.428 --> 12:46.097
He's already added the
science component to the mix.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.850
And thus, he has Curt Champlin
and-and Bereket

12:48.934 --> 12:52.604
to-to do
the geophysical investigation.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.515
And that, I think,
is reason enough

12:55.599 --> 12:57.683
to complement what he's doing.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.778
And the hope is that
we can assist him in some way.

13:09.363 --> 13:10.455
- Do you?
- MATTY: Really?

13:18.547 --> 13:19.714
- Really?
- So, correct me if I'm wrong,

13:19.873 --> 13:22.792
but you're talking
about two locations here today.

13:22.876 --> 13:24.302
One where you think
you found the mine,

13:24.386 --> 13:27.222
and one is this
king's tax location, correct?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.473
- MARTY: Oh, wow.
- Wow.

13:31.051 --> 13:34.303
NARRATOR: During the height
of Spanish mining in the Americas,

13:34.388 --> 13:36.481
between the 16th
to 19th centuries...

13:37.641 --> 13:40.059
the silver, gold
and jewels extracted

13:40.152 --> 13:43.062
were used to support Spain
and all of its colonies.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.991
However, in every case,
20% of the proceeds

13:47.076 --> 13:51.070
were earmarked for the Spanish
king and the royal family.

13:51.154 --> 13:53.656
JAMESON: The king's
tax, or the Royal fifth,

13:53.749 --> 13:56.584
was 20% set aside
for the monarch.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.579
So the monarch stood
to benefit from this.

13:59.663 --> 14:02.090
We've come across accounts
where some of it was set aside

14:02.249 --> 14:05.418
and buried with the intention
of coming back to get it.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.763
Okay. So, you've got--
We got a place to drill

14:08.848 --> 14:10.673
and you got a place where
you think there's another bunch

14:10.757 --> 14:12.267

14:12.351 --> 14:14.143
MARTY:
Yeah. Let's-- Could you show us?

the San Saba mine, right?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.878
How far off was he
from where you believe it to be?

14:41.714 --> 14:42.881
180 miles off?

Wow.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.968
NARRATOR:
In 1831,

14:47.052 --> 14:50.805
American pioneer
and frontiersman Jim Bowie

14:50.890 --> 14:54.383
became so obsessed by the legend
of the lost San Saba mine,

14:54.468 --> 14:57.145
that he obtained
official permission

14:57.304 --> 15:01.900
from the Mexican government to
lead an expedition to find it.

15:02.059 --> 15:06.228
On November 2nd,
Bowie, his brother Rezin

15:06.322 --> 15:08.907
and ten soldiers
set out from San Antonio,

15:09.066 --> 15:11.901
but just six miles
shy of their goal,

15:11.985 --> 15:14.245
they were intercepted
by a raiding party

15:14.330 --> 15:18.082
of 124 Tahuacano warriors.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.337
KELLY: We call it
the Fight at Calf Creek.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.163
They were under siege,

15:24.247 --> 15:26.591
fighting for their lives,
for about eight days.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.344
They were
outnumbered over ten to one.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.672
Bowie lost one man.
He had three wounded.

15:32.756 --> 15:35.508
Because they knew
how outnumbered they were,

15:35.592 --> 15:37.769
they had
cleared out of the area.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.680
When they came into San Antonio,
they were greeted as heroes.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.517
That Calf Creek fight,

15:44.601 --> 15:47.111
that's what made
Jim Bowie a legend in Texas.

15:48.939 --> 15:50.949
NARRATOR:
Undaunted, Bowie would return

15:51.108 --> 15:55.611
with a larger force
in January of 1832.

15:55.696 --> 15:58.706
However, after two months
of tireless searching

15:58.791 --> 16:00.708
for the San Saba mine,

16:00.793 --> 16:04.212
he found no signs of it
and had to suspend the search.

16:04.371 --> 16:07.957
Although he never stopped
researching possible locations

16:08.041 --> 16:09.875
of the vast
cache of hidden silver,

Hoppy's theory,
that there could be

17:38.807 --> 17:40.808
a treasure trove
quite separate from the mine,

17:40.893 --> 17:41.893
makes complete sense.

MARTY: If you're in

a storage area, where they kept

17:53.739 --> 17:55.314

NARRATOR: The numerous

18:41.862 --> 18:44.864
around the United States
have gained credibility

18:44.948 --> 18:47.625
among treasure hunters
due to common symbols

18:47.709 --> 18:51.045
that have been documented
during field investigations.

18:51.204 --> 18:55.708
For instance, an "H" is believed
to indicate a nearby tunnel.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.879
An encircled cross
may indicate a booby trap.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.141

an indication of buried gold.

a portion of

CURT: Yeah, I was out
here with Hoppy one day,

20:10.700 --> 20:11.784
and he was up there digging.

20:11.868 --> 20:14.036

all the geology and everything.

20:17.216 --> 20:21.052
And I came walking around here
and saw this big mound.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.380
And I told Hoppy that. And Hoppy
was like, "You know what,

20:24.464 --> 20:26.474
Ted and I have also
thought about that."

20:26.558 --> 20:28.226
And so Hoppy-- they came out...

20:31.313 --> 20:33.231
And it just started going in

20:34.399 --> 20:35.975
MARTY:
Right over here?

20:36.059 --> 20:37.893
Yeah, pretty much right
in the middle there.

20:37.978 --> 20:39.395
And it was just real loose.

20:39.479 --> 20:42.815
And then you'd go outside
this mound, do the same thing,

20:42.899 --> 20:45.150
and it's just solid.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.662
So, it really told us
there's some type of...

20:47.746 --> 20:49.655
- Excavation.
- Yeah.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.498
There's a cavity.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.408
- Exactly.
- Yep.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.411
This here is your face rock.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.338
You can see the face on it.

20:57.497 --> 21:00.925
Here's the nose...

21:01.009 --> 21:04.595
the mouth... the chin...

21:22.114 --> 21:24.440
NARRATOR: The biblical
figure known as Matthew

21:24.524 --> 21:27.693
was not only one of
Jesus's 12 disciples

21:27.777 --> 21:30.362
but is often depicted
in religious works of art

21:30.455 --> 21:32.123
as a winged man.

21:32.282 --> 21:34.709
However, he was also
reported to have had

21:34.793 --> 21:36.961
a very intriguing occupation.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.548
NARRATOR: Could Hoppy Eubanks
and Ted Underwood be correct

21:49.641 --> 21:53.719

the so-called king's tax of

21:56.973 --> 21:59.317

22:03.405 --> 22:05.323
- Here's your "L" rock.
- Mm-hmm.

22:05.482 --> 22:08.901
It means 13.
Either latitude or longitude.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.571
You take your cross and
you take your longest arm,

22:12.655 --> 22:14.999
and you go 13 foot,

22:15.158 --> 22:17.835
- and it puts you right down there.
- Right.

22:17.919 --> 22:20.913
NARRATOR: Before it
was altered in the 1990s,

22:20.997 --> 22:25.593
the Spanish alphabet
featured "L" as the 13th letter.

22:25.752 --> 22:29.588
Could Hoppy and Ted also be
correct that this mysterious

22:29.672 --> 22:34.093
L-shaped rock, which
incredibly sits exactly 13 feet

22:34.186 --> 22:36.762
from the mound where they
have started excavating,

22:36.846 --> 22:40.265
is another marker for the
so-called king's tax treasure?

22:40.350 --> 22:42.518
You know, this is 13.
Okay?

22:42.611 --> 22:45.771
And you've got 13 and 13...
All right?

22:45.855 --> 22:46.939
How deep do you think that is?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.866
To the treasure?

22:49.025 --> 22:52.361
- Well... I guess I would say 13.
- There you go.

22:53.205 --> 22:56.698
Hoppy has all these symbols
that he shows us.

22:56.783 --> 22:59.284
They are awfully subtle
to my mind,

22:59.378 --> 23:02.538
and so I'm a little bit dubious,
but I'm here, I'm in.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.039
We're gonna follow this trail.

23:04.124 --> 23:06.550
So, I see your methodology
and I see your signs and stuff,

23:06.635 --> 23:09.294
but isn't the proof of
the pudding in your hands there?

23:09.388 --> 23:12.890
This-this metal detector here
will pick up that treasure.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.466
Okey doke.

23:14.551 --> 23:16.560
Y'all ready to try out
this metal detector?

23:16.645 --> 23:17.978
MARTY: Yeah, now, now
let's go with the modern stuff.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.722
MATTY: Hoppy has
deciphered all the clues to mean

23:20.807 --> 23:22.066
that at this site
he should be digging 13 feet;

23:22.150 --> 23:23.559
he's got to about eight.

23:23.643 --> 23:25.811
But I was immediately impressed
because he's hand-digging

23:25.895 --> 23:28.155
this stuff with Ted,
and it was a massive amount

23:28.314 --> 23:29.648
of earth they've moved.

23:29.732 --> 23:30.741
He really, truly believes

23:30.900 --> 23:32.151
that there's treasure
right under there.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.745
So to stand on a site
like that is very exciting.

23:40.076 --> 23:41.752
Yeah.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.261
And this thing has a big
depth of investigation.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.179
TED: You can pinpoint
right where it is.

23:52.338 --> 23:53.222
MARTY:
That makes sense.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.510
NARRATOR: Hoppy is
using the White's TM 808

23:58.595 --> 24:00.604
TreasureMaster Metal Detector.

24:00.763 --> 24:03.607
It is designed to identify
both ferrous targets,

24:03.766 --> 24:06.777
such as iron, and also
nonferrous targets,

24:06.936 --> 24:10.114
such as gold and silver,
up to 20 feet deep.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.469
(device whining)

24:39.144 --> 24:41.812
RICK: When Hoppy shows
us some of these carved rocks,

24:41.897 --> 24:44.306
my mind immediately
goes back to Nolan's Cross

24:44.390 --> 24:48.569
and the so-called headstone.
And it's subjective.

24:48.728 --> 24:53.157
I mean, I'm not certain, even
now, that it truly was carved.

24:53.316 --> 24:55.576
I want to believe it,
as does Hoppy.

24:55.735 --> 24:58.987
- (device whining)
- Yeah.

24:59.072 --> 25:02.082
RICK: When Hoppy brings out
this metal detector, and it goes off,

25:02.167 --> 25:04.168
that's very compelling evidence.

25:04.327 --> 25:06.745
If that metal detector
is ringing at that site,

25:06.838 --> 25:09.173
then I want to get in
there with a shovel and dig.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.583
MATTY: Something's there. I
mean, it's picking up something.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.836
(device whining)

25:14.921 --> 25:17.506
Hoppy, what's your best
guess at what depth it is

25:17.590 --> 25:18.474
from where you're standing
right now?

25:19.935 --> 25:21.343
Six foot down below?

25:21.436 --> 25:22.353
MARTY:
Well, you're close.

25:22.512 --> 25:23.595
Huh.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.681
At this point,

25:25.765 --> 25:28.108
I'm pretty actively rooting
for Hoppy. You know?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.277
And I've seen all the earth
he's moved, he's brought us to

25:30.362 --> 25:32.354
this spot he believes
that there's actual treasure.

25:32.438 --> 25:35.357
So, you know...
now I'm getting excited

25:35.441 --> 25:38.360
because everything's lining
up with Hoppy's theory.

25:38.444 --> 25:41.280
I'm in now. I want to dig.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.783
If it were me, I'd grab
that shovel and that pick,

25:44.867 --> 25:46.868
and I would dig that tonight.

25:46.953 --> 25:49.204
How about taking a probe bar

25:49.289 --> 25:50.714
and just pounding it
down five feet?

25:52.041 --> 25:52.883
Why not?

26:02.218 --> 26:03.227
Sure.

26:03.386 --> 26:05.137
You believe that there's
something down there

26:05.230 --> 26:08.307
that is not...

26:08.391 --> 26:10.067
- That's my question.
- Right.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.507
You know, I somewhat apologize
for what I just said

26:33.592 --> 26:37.753
because I'm contradicting
what I've always

26:37.837 --> 26:39.930
- purported to believe on Oak Island.
- MARTY: Yeah, you are a bit.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.173
You don't want
to damage anything.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.508
Take your time.

26:43.593 --> 26:46.178
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

26:46.262 --> 26:48.513
And if you take a piece of
equipment and try to rush it,

26:48.607 --> 26:51.609
you're gonna end up missing
something like this--

26:51.768 --> 26:53.527
And destroying it
or just never seeing it--

26:53.686 --> 26:55.437
That you needed to use.

26:55.521 --> 26:58.699
When Hoppy suggests
that a mechanized approach

26:58.858 --> 27:01.118
is not a viable option,

27:01.202 --> 27:03.746
we can affirm that
because of the Dunfield dig.

27:04.864 --> 27:08.033
Dunfield took
a all-or-nothing approach

27:08.126 --> 27:09.284
on Oak Island.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.787
He brought in
a mechanized clamshell digger

27:11.880 --> 27:14.298
and he dug away, literally,

27:14.382 --> 27:18.302
a hole about 140-plus feet deep
and 100 feet wide.

27:18.386 --> 27:22.139
And we know there was some
destruction associated with it.

27:22.223 --> 27:26.218
But Hoppy's concern
is the same as Dunfield's.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.469
It's the same as ours.

27:27.553 --> 27:30.472
That you don't know what
you're digging into,

27:30.556 --> 27:33.400
and thus his advice
to stand down and hand-dig

27:33.559 --> 27:34.735
is very appropriate.

27:34.894 --> 27:37.562
Hoppy, I think, number one,
I want to thank you

27:37.647 --> 27:40.148
for your time and, you know,
explaining to us

27:40.233 --> 27:41.992
what is a pretty amazing story.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.069
I think we've learned
more than a few things.

27:44.153 --> 27:46.738
But I do want to do one thing.

27:46.823 --> 27:49.500
Because I do believe
that you're onto something.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.586
So, with your permission,
what I would really like to do

27:52.671 --> 27:55.914
is take that shovel and just
dig one scoop of dirt in there

27:55.998 --> 27:58.500
and say that I participated in

27:58.584 --> 28:01.470
Hoppy Eubanks's and
Ted Underwood's adventure.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.011
This is where the signals were,
so I'm gonna take a big scoop

28:10.096 --> 28:14.942
right here.

28:15.101 --> 28:16.860
That must mean something.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.862
Here, let me show you
how you do a ceremonial dig

28:18.947 --> 28:20.689
- and throw it out of the hole.
- (laughter) - Okey doke.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.700
MATTY:
That's a great idea, Rick.

28:22.784 --> 28:23.701
You take about that much,
you see...

28:23.785 --> 28:25.193
(laughter)

28:25.286 --> 28:26.787
and fling it out of the hole.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.113
RICK (laughing):
Right.

28:28.197 --> 28:30.449
Come on, silver.
There's a lot of clay here.

28:30.542 --> 28:34.044
MARTY: No, it's hard
digging. It's very like Oak Island.

28:34.203 --> 28:36.037
That is.

28:36.122 --> 28:37.548
All right.
It's official.

28:37.707 --> 28:40.050
Hoppy, you took us
on a wild ride today.

28:40.209 --> 28:41.343
Yeah.

28:43.463 --> 28:45.297
Tomorrow!
And let's drill.

28:45.381 --> 28:46.724
All right. We're in.

28:47.884 --> 28:48.851
Let's go.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.729
Yeah, that's enough for today.

29:06.652 --> 29:08.912
NARRATOR:
The following day,

29:09.071 --> 29:11.823
Rick, Marty and Matty
arrive at the site

29:11.908 --> 29:14.501
where they're going to assist
treasure hunter Hoppy Eubanks

29:14.586 --> 29:18.172
and his team in a drilling
operation to locate millions

29:18.256 --> 29:23.093
in lost silver and gold
from the historic San Saba mine.

29:23.252 --> 29:27.347
Based on previous
electrical resistivity scans,

29:27.432 --> 29:29.841
it is geologist Curt Champlin's
suspicion

29:29.934 --> 29:33.103
that there is a void, or
possible mine entrance,

29:33.262 --> 29:37.933
somewhere between 35
and 75 feet underground.

29:38.017 --> 29:41.186
Hey, guys, I lost
a mine somewhere around here.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.279
Has anybody found it?

29:43.773 --> 29:45.449
- I have no idea.
- (laughter)

29:45.608 --> 29:48.452
MATTY: Hoppy has brought
us out to where he believes

29:48.611 --> 29:51.363
is the actual location
of the lost San Saba mine,

29:51.447 --> 29:52.873
where the Spanish pulled
a lot of gold and silver

29:52.957 --> 29:54.041
out of the ground.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.710
If he's right, we'll
expect to hit a void

29:56.795 --> 29:57.878
at the spot we're gonna drill.

29:58.037 --> 30:00.047
If they hit that void,
that means that could be

30:00.206 --> 30:02.123
the lost San Saba mine.

30:02.208 --> 30:03.467
Hey, Hoppy, today's the day.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.551
Perfect.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.135
(laughter)

30:14.220 --> 30:15.229
All right.
Are we ready to make hole?

30:15.388 --> 30:17.731
- TED: Let's do it.
- ERIC: Darrin, rig ready?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.224
- Rig's ready.
- ERIC: Let's get it.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.317
Let's fire it up.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.319
(whirring)

30:23.646 --> 30:25.739
Ah, I love the sound
of a drill firing up

30:25.824 --> 30:27.241
when you're treasure-hunting.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.984
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoo!

30:29.068 --> 30:30.661
(laughter)

30:32.997 --> 30:36.166
NARRATOR: The Laginas have
arranged for a direct rotary rig

30:36.251 --> 30:38.660
for today's investigation.

30:38.744 --> 30:41.162
As the six-inch-wide sections
of drill pipe

30:41.247 --> 30:42.998
are driven into the ground,

30:43.091 --> 30:45.676
the rig will also
force air downward,

30:45.760 --> 30:48.169
bringing sediment
or spoils to the surface

30:48.254 --> 30:49.680
through an exhaust nozzle.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.767
Geologist Curt Champlin
and the team will then

30:53.852 --> 30:56.520
sift through them,
looking for any evidence

30:56.604 --> 30:58.939
of a possible mineshaft.

30:59.098 --> 31:01.266
MATTY:
So, Curt, we're hoping

31:01.359 --> 31:04.027
the drill works its way
through that limestone cap rock,

31:04.186 --> 31:05.612
and then we're gonna
hopefully see a drop.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.364
- Yeah.
- All right.

31:08.691 --> 31:11.359
MATTY: The drill's
going. It's exciting.

31:11.452 --> 31:14.362
We're analyzing
the dirt and soil

31:14.455 --> 31:16.448
as it's going through its depths

31:16.532 --> 31:18.867
because if there's
any significant changes

31:18.951 --> 31:20.544
or anything that could indicate

31:20.703 --> 31:23.038
that they're on this void
they've been looking for.

31:23.122 --> 31:25.549
- RICK: Limestone?
- MARTY: Not limestone, no.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.058
ERIC:
So, we're down to 40 feet.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.233
MATTY:
Very dense clay.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.069
Is that a glass?

31:53.736 --> 31:55.236
- Oh, it's a leaf.
- (laughs)

31:55.330 --> 31:58.081
Well, we saw something green
and shiny.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.417
- I thought maybe it was an emerald.
- Yeah.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.667
- MARTY: How deep are you?
- ERIC: 55.

32:08.751 --> 32:11.094
We went from 15 to 55 real fast.

32:13.339 --> 32:15.265
(whirring, hissing)

32:19.762 --> 32:21.513
Whoa.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.181
It's blowing.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.734
It's definitely blowing,
but it's blowing nothing.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.113
Could that be a void?

32:30.198 --> 32:31.949
- RICK: That could be.
- CURT: Exactly.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.947
NARRATOR:
In Stephenville, Texas,

32:39.031 --> 32:43.543
Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Matty Blake,

32:43.628 --> 32:45.462
are helping treasure hunter
Hoppy Eubanks in his quest

32:45.546 --> 32:48.623
to locate
the lost San Saba mine.

32:48.708 --> 32:51.126
Having just reached a depth
of 55 feet,

32:51.219 --> 32:54.137
the drilling team is
suddenly reporting

32:54.296 --> 32:56.306
a potentially
significant development.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.720
MARTY: I wonder if
that hole's taking air.

33:01.804 --> 33:04.815
Is it moving air
or is it just pressuring up?

33:06.475 --> 33:08.485
So, we've lost circulation,

33:08.569 --> 33:10.145
meaning the air is
no longer coming up.

33:10.229 --> 33:11.980
It's no longer bringing
the cuttings up.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.907
Lots of possible reasons
for that.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.492
One that's hopeful,
though, is that

33:15.651 --> 33:16.985
if we're starting
to get into a cavity--

33:17.069 --> 33:18.570
And it really is a cavity--

33:18.654 --> 33:21.581
The air could leak off instead
of coming back to the surface.

33:21.741 --> 33:23.834
(whirring, hissing)

33:30.925 --> 33:32.843
- CURT: There she goes.
- MARTY: There she goes.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.512
It looks like
something is coming out.

33:38.674 --> 33:41.760
- What do we got, Eric?
- So, we're going down, uh,

33:41.844 --> 33:43.311
this will be 60 feet right here.

33:44.930 --> 33:49.526
There is water coming in either
above or below a hard zone.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.519
It's not making
a lot of cuttings,

33:51.604 --> 33:54.439
but it's, uh, it's definitely
blowing some mud out.

33:54.523 --> 33:56.950
The moisture down there
sort of is a good sign.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.861
MATTY: Why is that a
good sign to you, Curt?

33:59.945 --> 34:02.706
- What do you like about that?
- CURT: If there was sand down below,

34:02.865 --> 34:04.541
water would've kept
trickling down.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.117
- Right. Okay.
- That sort of tells me that

34:06.202 --> 34:08.453
- there may be an impermeable limestone.
- Okay.

34:08.546 --> 34:09.621
So, it's hitting something
hard and sitting there.

34:09.705 --> 34:10.714
Something hard
and sitting there.

34:11.874 --> 34:13.458
And that could be the,
that could be the cap

34:13.542 --> 34:14.968
- to the void that we're looking for.
- That could be the cap.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.304
- Yeah.
- All right.

34:17.388 --> 34:21.132
NARRATOR: Now that the drill
has reached a depth of nearly 65 feet,

34:21.225 --> 34:24.728
the presence of moisture
in the spoils may indicate

34:24.812 --> 34:28.389
a layer of rock
that is causing water to pool.

34:28.474 --> 34:30.567
Could it be a limestone cap

34:30.726 --> 34:34.229
or possible ceiling
for the lost San Saba mine?

34:35.397 --> 34:39.326
So right now, ideally,
in the next couple drills,

34:39.410 --> 34:40.902
you'd want to see
that thing working hard.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.579
Cutting through
whatever it might be.

34:42.738 --> 34:44.405
I'd like to start seeing
limestone powder

34:44.499 --> 34:45.749
- coming out.
- Got it. Whoa.

34:46.992 --> 34:48.168
Something just came up.

34:48.327 --> 34:50.078
Whoa. That was powdery.

34:50.162 --> 34:51.746
CURT:
Still getting a good airflow.

34:51.831 --> 34:53.423
MATTY: Yeah, it's blowing.
It's definitely blowing.

34:55.751 --> 34:58.095
Oh, now it's starting
to spit up some material.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.264
We're going down to 65
right now.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.601
So, we're ten foot
off the target.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.602
All right.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.853
ERIC:
So, we're at 70 feet right now.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.905
Five more feet.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.107
Five more feet, we'd like to see

35:19.191 --> 35:20.692
some white smoke, maybe, right?

35:20.776 --> 35:22.193
You want that thing hitting
something hard?

35:22.286 --> 35:23.194
Or some glitter.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.913
Yeah. Or that.

35:27.533 --> 35:29.042
ERIC:
All right.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.710
This is the last one.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.629
(Matty exhales)

35:32.713 --> 35:34.798
- MATTY: This is it?
- ERIC: This is it.

35:38.627 --> 35:41.555
I see a little...
Is that a little smoky?

35:41.639 --> 35:43.473
Hitting something hard there?

35:43.558 --> 35:44.799
Or is that just...

35:45.968 --> 35:47.978
MARTY: Yeah. Probably
sat down on something.

35:49.221 --> 35:52.149
CURT: At this point,
we have drilled 75 feet.

35:52.308 --> 35:54.901
And we've hit mostly sand
all the way down.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.238
We were hoping
we would hit cap rock

35:58.322 --> 36:00.148
or some hard sediment.

36:00.232 --> 36:03.401
And at this point in time,

36:03.485 --> 36:07.122
we may be on top
of where the mineshaft is.

36:10.743 --> 36:13.244
- ERIC: The bucket we've all been waiting for.
- Here it is.

36:13.329 --> 36:14.746
- Come on, baby.
- MATTY: This could be good.

36:14.839 --> 36:15.755
Here it comes.

36:15.915 --> 36:18.082
Moment of truth, buddy.

36:18.167 --> 36:20.093
Oh, there you go.
There's limestone right there.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.419
Is that limestone?

36:21.512 --> 36:24.505
Isn't it? No?

36:24.599 --> 36:27.508
Soft, soft clay again.
Clay-ish.

36:27.593 --> 36:29.686
MARTY: Well, we know
where the mine isn't.

36:29.770 --> 36:30.937
- It's not right there.
- (laughter)

36:31.096 --> 36:32.105
MATTY:
That's right.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.275
(thunder rumbling)

36:35.359 --> 36:37.352
ERIC:
Well, guys.

36:37.436 --> 36:39.863
Good news is, we're at 75 feet.

36:40.022 --> 36:41.698
Right.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.367
Bad news is,
we're not seeing treasure.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.444
And it's looking like

36:46.528 --> 36:48.205
we've got rain and lightning
coming our way.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.042
(thunder rumbling)

36:57.715 --> 36:59.290
So, you've got to shut down
anyway, then.

36:59.383 --> 36:59.799
We're gonna have to shut down
for safety reasons.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.709
Yeah.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.053
NARRATOR:
At the possible site

37:03.212 --> 37:05.797
of the lost Spanish San Saba
silver mine,

37:05.881 --> 37:08.383
the Laginas and Matty Blake
had high hopes

37:08.467 --> 37:10.644
of helping
treasure hunter Hoppy Eubanks

37:10.803 --> 37:13.146
make a historic discovery.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.056
- (thunder rumbling)
- But unfortunately

37:15.149 --> 37:17.817
severe weather is
fast approaching,

37:17.902 --> 37:20.320
making their drilling operation
too dangerous to continue,

37:20.404 --> 37:22.989
at least for now.

37:23.148 --> 37:24.032
Ah, that's too bad.

37:32.324 --> 37:33.667
- MARTY: No.
- MATTY: No.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.661
- RICK: I'm not giving up.
- No, I know he's not giving up.

37:36.745 --> 37:38.830
You're not giving up.
Nobody's giving up.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.665
- (laughter) - Except
we're giving up for today.

37:40.749 --> 37:42.425
Unfortunately,
it looks that way.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.585
But I would recommend one thing,
and that's lidar.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.921
We've come to appreciate that.

37:47.014 --> 37:49.516
And I think,
because you have located

37:49.600 --> 37:52.343
what you believe are at least
two smelter locations,

37:52.428 --> 37:54.604
that's your point A.

37:54.763 --> 37:56.848
If the lidar shows--
'cause you're gonna bring

37:56.932 --> 37:58.850
your ore to the smelter--

37:58.943 --> 38:01.269
And it's going to be back
and forth, back and forth.

38:01.353 --> 38:03.863
- Lidar will pick that up.
- I think Rick is dead-on.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.615
It could show you a road

38:05.700 --> 38:08.359
that was used
back when this was used

38:08.444 --> 38:09.861
that's completely invisible now.

38:09.945 --> 38:12.697
That there's no way you'd see it
walking around or whatever.

38:12.781 --> 38:15.792
But it-it'll pick it out because
of the compaction in the ground.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.794
I mean,
i-it might be just this much,

38:17.878 --> 38:18.795
but it'll pick it up.

38:20.873 --> 38:21.881
MATTY:
Thank you.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.301
Mutual. Mutual.

38:25.627 --> 38:27.804
You know, the thing
that strikes me here is,

38:27.888 --> 38:31.141
the glue that holds all of this
together is the story.

38:31.300 --> 38:35.061
- (thunder rumbling) - Right? The
historical context of this is remarkable.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.639
A-Again, I can't say enough
about it and I thank you both

38:38.724 --> 38:42.068
for allowing us to-to come
and be a part of that.

38:42.227 --> 38:45.071
Appreciate it. Thank you.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.156
It's been a wild ride.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.741
And I want to thank
both of you guys

38:47.825 --> 38:49.159
- for-for the ride.
- Thank you.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.410
And I really like
both your spirits.

38:50.569 --> 38:52.570
I mean, I really do.

38:52.654 --> 38:55.915
But anyway, you stay at it,
and let us know how it goes.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.752
(thunder rumbling)

38:58.911 --> 39:01.245
- Guys, it's time to get out of here.
- MARTY: I believe so.

39:01.330 --> 39:04.174
- I believe so.
- I think Texas is letting us know that we're done here.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.666
- (laughter)
- Hey, till the next time.

39:05.751 --> 39:08.678
Cheers, guys. Appreciate it.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.478
We will see you again, Hoppy.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.360
- (engine starts)
- Take care, guys.

39:36.448 --> 39:37.874
(Hoppy mutters)

39:37.958 --> 39:38.875
Don't let up.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.044
Thank you, Texas!

39:50.129 --> 39:51.346
(laughter)

39:53.557 --> 39:57.218
Man, I really started to root
for Hoppy there.

39:57.311 --> 40:00.063
- Uh, I think we all did.
- Yeah.

40:00.222 --> 40:02.816
I-I just was struck
by the similarities

40:02.900 --> 40:04.734
between what he's
attempting to do

40:04.819 --> 40:07.654
and what Dan Blankenship
and Fred Nolan

40:07.813 --> 40:09.313
tried to do on Oak Island.

40:09.398 --> 40:11.991
You know, I was struck by that.

40:12.076 --> 40:15.829
And just like Dan took Oak
Island as his personal Everest,

40:15.913 --> 40:18.415
maybe this is
Hoppy's personal Everest.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.908
- I think it is.
- Yeah.

40:20.993 --> 40:22.326
I love that money
isn't motivating him.

40:22.411 --> 40:24.412
A lot of guys say, "Oh, money.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.164
Money doesn't motivate me
at all."

40:26.248 --> 40:28.833
- Most of them are lying.
- (laughter)

40:28.926 --> 40:30.176
Uh, but he isn't.

40:30.335 --> 40:31.594
I don't think he is.

40:31.679 --> 40:35.006
- No.
- And, um, that's very admirable.

40:35.090 --> 40:36.266
Yes, it is.

40:39.011 --> 40:41.596
You know, I think
we thought Oak Island was

40:41.680 --> 40:43.514
the end-all be-all
of treasure hunts.

40:43.599 --> 40:46.443
But there's a lot of treasure
and treasure hunts

40:46.527 --> 40:48.102
to-to participate in.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.937
There's a lot beyond Oak Island.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.023
- Yeah. A lot.
- Yes, there is.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.534
- MATTY: On to the next one.
- MARTY: On we go. Right?

40:54.618 --> 40:56.035
RICK:
You got it.
