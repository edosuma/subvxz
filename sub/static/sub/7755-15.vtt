What's the point of cleaning
under the bed?
It's like cleaning a dumpster!

00:28.963 --> 00:33.232
It's<i> designed</i> to be filthy!
>> Mom: Because this room smells
like dog burp.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.101
Ugh!
What is<i> this?</i>
>> Gumball: Oh.

00:36.103 --> 00:40.739
That's a glass of milk.
[ Ooooooooooze! ]
Cheese -- t-that's a glass of

00:40.741 --> 00:42.641

[ Pop! Crash! ]
>> Dad: Aah!

00:42.643 --> 00:45.944
[ Groans ]
>> Gumball: Stone -- that's a
glass of stone.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.680
>> Mom: Are you kidding me?!
That milk had to be at least 10
years old.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.283
>> Darwin: Well, at least
there's nothing alive under
there.

>> Darwin: Aah!
>> [ Shrieking ]

00:56.357 --> 00:59.491

>> Mom: [ Gasps ]
Darwin i?

00:59.493 --> 01:02.661
So<i> that's</i> where you were hiding.
[ Gasps ]
>> Darwin: Wait.

01:02.663 --> 01:06.965
I thought you said that Darwin i
left to live a happier life on a
farm with other fishes.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.902
>> Gumball: [ Laughs nervously ]
He did.
Uh...He did.

01:09.904 --> 01:13.539
>> Mom: Uhhh...
Hey!
Look what i found!

01:13.541 --> 01:16.175
The game you made.
>> Darwin: Hey, gum, I'm not 3
anymore.

01:16.177 --> 01:22.014
You're not gonna distract me
with -- what the what?
[ Dunnnnn! ]

01:22.016 --> 01:24.850
Dodj or daar. [Dodge or dare]
It's calling us.
>> Gumball: No!

01:24.852 --> 01:28.921
We swore we'd never play that
game again!

01:29.389 --> 01:34.326

Just ignore the calls.

[ Sighs ]

01:40.067 --> 01:44.169
[ Dunnnnn! ]
[ Nasally ] We have to destroy
that game.

01:44.171 --> 01:50.209
[ Screech! ]
It's gone!
[ Dunnnnn! ]

01:50.211 --> 01:56.181
>> Both: Wait!
[ Slo-mo ] don't throw the dice!

01:57.250 --> 02:00.853
>> You don't know what you're
doing!
>> Dad: Yeah, 'cause you didn't

02:00.855 --> 02:03.489
write any instructions.
>> Anais: And what you<i> did</i> write
is spelled wrong.

02:03.491 --> 02:08.026
"Dodj or daar"?
Sounds like an alien choosing a
baby name.

02:08.028 --> 02:11.830
>> Dad: Let's just pack it away.
>> Gumball: No! You can't stop!
Once you start dodj or daar...

02:11.832 --> 02:15.267
[ Dunnnnn! ]
[ Echoing ] ...It has to be
finished.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.370
Okay, so, the rules are pretty
simple.
You roll the dice, then take a

02:18.372 --> 02:21.473
daar card.
If you do the daar, then you
move forward that many spaces.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.710
If you don't, then you have to
take a dodj card and move half
the spaces.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.378
>> Mom: Okay.
And how do you win?
>> Gumball: [ Echoing ] You

02:26.380 --> 02:31.617
don't win.
You survive.
>> Mom: O...Kay.

02:31.619 --> 02:36.121
But how<i> do</i> you actually win?
>> Gumball: [ Normal voice ] Oh.
You have to roll an exact number

02:36.123 --> 02:39.558
to land on the last square.
Dad, you're up.
>> Dad: [ Giggles ]

02:39.560 --> 02:44.496
[ Laughs ]
I feel sorry for whoever's got
to do this one.

02:47.634 --> 02:51.336
[ Panting ]
Officer, please!
I need to report a theft!

02:51.338 --> 02:54.973
>> Yes! Finally!
What did the thief look like?
>> Dad: Well, he was wearing a

02:54.975 --> 02:58.210
monocle.
>> Uh-huh. Uh --
o...Kay.

02:58.212 --> 03:02.147
Uh...Anything else?
>> Dad: Yes -- he had a big,
furry mustache.

03:02.149 --> 03:08.220
>> Uh-huh, big furry musta--
okay.
Any other distinguishing

03:08.222 --> 03:11.790
features?
>> Dad: Yes -- he was dressed as
a yodeler.

03:12.492 --> 03:16.795
Aren't you gonna write that
down?
>> Just testing something.

03:20.567 --> 03:24.269
[ Ping! ]
Yaaah!
And what did that man steal?

03:24.271 --> 03:27.739
>> Dad: A kiss.
>> Mom: [ Laughing ]
>> Anais: You actually did it?

03:27.741 --> 03:32.010
[ Giggles ]
>> Gumball: Oh, yeah.
That's how it always starts --

03:32.012 --> 03:35.380
with the laughing and the daars,
and then later...
[ Echoing ] The horror and fear!

03:35.382 --> 03:41.353
>> Mom: My go!
Hm.
"Order a prank pizza."

03:41.355 --> 03:43.722
>> Uh-huh.
And what's the address?
>> Mom: [ Snickers ]

03:43.724 --> 03:47.159
420 grove street.
Oh, and could you add some
Turkey gizzards?

03:47.161 --> 03:51.096
>> As well as the ice cream,
pig's foot, and oysters?
>> Mom: Yes, i-it's an old

grandfather...

I wish i could be there to see

03:59.907 --> 04:07.012
that pizza arrive.
>> Okay, 420 grove street.
Here we go.

04:09.549 --> 04:13.018
Pizza guy!
What are you talking about?
I<i> sell</i> pizzas.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.088
Why would i<i> buy</i> one?
Well,<i> someone's</i> gotta pay for
this.

04:16.090 --> 04:18.824
I'm not paying for something i
didn't order!
What am i supposed to do with

04:18.826 --> 04:22.961
this now?
Give it to me! I'll show ya!
Hyah!

04:22.963 --> 04:25.564
[ Splat! ]
[ Slosh! ]
I think all these jobs are

04:25.566 --> 04:31.770
messing with my head.
>> Anais: [ Straining ] I'm now
wearing...

04:31.772 --> 04:35.007

04:40.648 --> 04:45.250
Darwin, dad, and...Me.
Although, of course,
technically, this card says

04:45.252 --> 04:49.621
every "thing" in the house.
>> Anais: I<i> am</i> wearing
everything -- even dad's

04:49.623 --> 04:52.891
fat-camp girdle!
>> Mom: Every "thing," anais,
not just clothes.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.693
The couch is a thing.
Are you wearing that?
>> Anais: What?!

04:54.695 --> 04:58.930
>> Mom: Tut-tut-tut-tut!
No arguing, young lady.
You need to learn to be a good

04:58.932 --> 05:02.634

Now take your dodj.

I actually felt that through six
pairs of shoes!
>> Darwin: It's starting!!

05:08.609 --> 05:11.843
We have to finish the game
quickly before it gets ahold of
us and destroys us all!

05:11.845 --> 05:14.613
>> Gumball: Dude, keep it
together.
[ Slap! ]

05:14.615 --> 05:16.415
>> Darwin: Get a grip on
yourself!
You're underreacting!

05:16.417 --> 05:19.217
>> Gumball: Thanks, man!
I needed that!
I got a bit calm for a second,

05:19.219 --> 05:21.553
but now i realize how serious
this is!

Aaaah!

"Run past a dog wearing a suit

05:24.992 --> 05:28.160

That doesn't sound too bad.

Waaaaaaah!

05:37.404 --> 05:39.571
>> Dad: [ Growling ]
>> Gumball: The worst part is,
it took four weeks to stitch

05:39.573 --> 05:43.909
that suit, and it was gone in
under a minute.
>> Dad: [ Laughs ]

05:43.911 --> 05:48.046

Um...I'll take a dodj.
"Your left arm must do what the

ends.

difference, mom.
The game's too powerful.
>> Mom: The only power this game

07:22.509 --> 07:24.810
has is the power you give it.

moving again?
