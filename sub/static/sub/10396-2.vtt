Or a bow tie and there's

04:36.209 --> 04:38.878
still some places in Miami
that still have that.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.213
This is how you drink
coffee in Miami.

04:41.214 --> 04:44.250
What do they call this?

04:44.251 --> 04:46.586
It's a big cup with little cups.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.656
It is basically like the
coffee version, the caffeine

04:49.657 --> 04:51.491
version of a one-hitter.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.260

taste it and they all
grow up loving coffee.

land, Miami.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.615
It is.

You can pretty much get
away with almost anything.

It's good coffee.

cubano sandwich, but you'd be

05:44.111 --> 05:44.311
wrong.

05:44.312 --> 05:48.981
This is not a cubano sandwich.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.283
Close, a cousin.

05:51.284 --> 05:55.822
Ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, a

05:55.823 --> 06:00.259
little mustard and like a cubano

06:00.260 --> 06:03.463
it is pressed until
it is soft inside.

Is it yummy?

06:18.278 --> 06:19.345
It's good.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.681
A lot of thought is given to the

06:21.682 --> 06:22.949
structure of the sandwich.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.184
It is all about the layers.

Yeah.

This is the perfect
breakfast, right?

course of the meal, dessert.

Cheese over dessert any day.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.705
Yes.

06:45.706 --> 06:52.612
I'd rather have steak over
dessert, but maybe that's

You know what the amazing
thing about being 100 is?

08:17.297 --> 08:24.370
Last year I was 99.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.305
Nobody cared.

old this year.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.243
Yes, 100.

He's still here.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.082
The cigarette smoke and dark

08:37.083 --> 08:38.918
dank atmosphere pretty good for

08:38.919 --> 08:44.155
a guy that's seen it all.

08:44.157 --> 08:47.259
That's 73 years ago.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.061
Matt Klein came from new

08:49.062 --> 08:50.997
York's lower east side by way of

08:50.998 --> 08:53.666
the battle of Normandy.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.835
I came here pause I was

08:55.836 --> 08:59.405
wounded and the warm weather
was much better for me.

08:59.406 --> 09:04.243
But there was a lot of G.I.S

09:04.244 --> 09:05.444
during the war here, right?

09:05.445 --> 09:08.848
They saw a world that
they didn't believe.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.450
During world war ii, Miami

09:11.451 --> 09:16.422
saw a massive influx
of military personnel.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.357
Hotels, which had seen a sharp

09:18.358 --> 09:20.026
drop in business, made a deal

09:20.027 --> 09:24.463
with the government to house
troops in empty resorts.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.934
Parents came down, sons came

09:27.935 --> 09:28.535
down, they opened businesses

09:28.536 --> 09:29.869
here, and they were basically

09:29.870 --> 09:32.204
Jewish at the time and
that's how it started.

09:32.205 --> 09:36.042
By the fall of 1942, more

09:36.043 --> 09:38.377
than 78,000 troops were living

09:38.378 --> 09:43.049
in more than 300 hotels
in Miami and Miami beach.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.717
How long have you been
running the deuce?

09:44.718 --> 09:47.319
I took over in 1964.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.355
Half of my life I've spent here.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.557
Miami beach has turned over at

09:51.558 --> 09:54.994
least six times since
I've been here.

09:54.995 --> 10:00.700
All I need is "Miami vice."

10:00.701 --> 10:01.734
This was their favorite bar.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.069
It makes sense too.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.237
Still, it was very flattering.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.708
The same as how flattering
it is to have you here.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.509
I love this place.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.411
I mean I love it.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.012
It's my favorite bar in Miami.

10:12.013 --> 10:14.381
To many more.

10:37.604 --> 10:43.242
The dreamers, the visionaries,
crooks, and con men

10:43.243 --> 10:45.444
who built Miami envision many

10:45.445 --> 10:47.780
different kinds of paradise.

10:47.781 --> 10:54.453
A new Jerusalem in the
infinitely expanding real

10:54.454 --> 10:58.457
estate, just fill in where
there's water and you've got

10:58.458 --> 10:58.926
property.

10:58.927 --> 11:04.263
Or as in coral gables,
a new Venice.

11:04.264 --> 11:10.536
Gone Doe last to ferry the new

11:10.537 --> 11:14.874
seekers to their
palatzos in the sun.

11:14.875 --> 11:20.546
The dream was as
expandable as the space.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.381
Where there was water, there was

11:22.382 --> 11:30.382
now magically Terra
sort a firma.

11:33.393 --> 11:37.629
And in the 80s where there was

11:37.630 --> 11:43.602
decline, a vacuum, suddenly
there was a new and vibrant

11:43.603 --> 11:49.809
economy one that raised all
boats, shiny cars, swanky

11:49.810 --> 11:51.243
nightclubs, and a new reputation

11:51.244 --> 11:56.115
for murder and criminality
to go with it.

11:56.116 --> 11:56.583
Cocaine.

11:56.584 --> 12:02.822
Say what you will, cocaine
altered the skyline of Miami

12:02.823 --> 12:03.056
forever.

12:03.057 --> 12:06.658
It made, for better or
worse, Miami sexy again.

12:06.659 --> 12:11.798
Going back to the very
beginning, was Miami always a

12:11.799 --> 12:14.000
criminal enterprise?

12:14.001 --> 12:18.871
But I mean that in a good way.

12:18.872 --> 12:22.041
Outlaw culturism a very deep
part of American culture.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.544
We don't produce or manufacture
anything but oranges

12:25.545 --> 12:27.013
or handguns.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.047
We sell sunshine.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.682
The only jobs we have are in

12:30.683 --> 12:35.554
hospitality or in restaurants.

12:35.555 --> 12:35.956
Real estate.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.323
Real estate.

12:36.324 --> 12:38.724
It is all to sell the
dream to the next people.

12:38.725 --> 12:43.695
In 1981 the FBI called Miami
the most violent city in

12:43.696 --> 12:43.931
America.

12:43.932 --> 12:49.335
The drug industry brought in an

12:49.336 --> 12:51.737
estimated to 7 to $12 billion a

12:51.738 --> 12:53.906
year and that was of 1981 Miami.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.075
That is a lot of trickle down.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.810
One of the most successful

12:57.811 --> 13:04.083
documentaries in the history of

13:04.084 --> 13:06.919
film is "cocaine cowboys"
that tells that story.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.389
So things were in decline.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.425
Cocaine sort of saved the city?

13:13.426 --> 13:14.493
We'd say so.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.230
Am I going to get
in trouble for it?

13:18.231 --> 13:18.498
Yes.

13:18.499 --> 13:20.732
You had a murder rate.

13:20.733 --> 13:25.571
25% of those bodies had
automatic weapons bullets.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.541
We talk about the uncomfortable
reality of where a

13:29.542 --> 13:32.678
lot of the modern Miami came

13:32.679 --> 13:35.381
from over something you just

13:35.382 --> 13:42.788
have to hit hard in
Miami when in season.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.223
Stone crabs.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.460
Federal reserve branch in
Miami had a $5 billion cash

13:48.461 --> 13:48.795
surplus.

13:48.796 --> 13:52.731
Mostly 50s and 100 dollar bills

13:52.732 --> 13:55.034
all of which had trace
elements of cocaine on them.

13:55.035 --> 14:02.241
And the guys in cocaine
trafficking got out and are now

14:02.242 --> 14:03.642
big medicare fraudsters.

14:03.643 --> 14:08.414
We're whispering because
they're probably here.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.216
So where's the money now?

14:10.217 --> 14:11.283
How's business in general in

14:11.284 --> 14:15.821
Miami and where is that
business coming from?

14:15.822 --> 14:18.490
Remarkably the rebound from

14:18.491 --> 14:20.792
the great recession, the people

14:20.793 --> 14:22.428
thought it would take a decade

14:22.429 --> 14:25.397
and it seemed to happen
almost overnight.

14:25.398 --> 14:30.002
We're in the middle
of another huge boom.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.837
Who is buying?

14:31.838 --> 14:34.606
Wealthy foreigners.

14:34.607 --> 14:40.146
A lot of capital Russians.

14:40.147 --> 14:45.184
If it is money looted from
another country, do we care?

14:45.185 --> 14:53.185
The question is how
long will it last?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.198
There's history and there's

14:59.199 --> 15:05.871
the more immediate
needs of the present.

15:05.872 --> 15:09.508
I need food presently and
perhaps some fine bourbon and

15:09.509 --> 15:11.944
when I need good food in a city

15:11.945 --> 15:14.180
not my own, more and more these

15:14.181 --> 15:16.215
days I call somebody if they

15:16.216 --> 15:18.450
weren't good at enough things

15:18.451 --> 15:21.120
already has become something of

15:21.121 --> 15:23.555
an expert on food
around the world.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.724
Every time I check Instagram

15:25.725 --> 15:33.725
you're eating with one
of my culinary heros.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.734
I'm here.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.836
You've been to
this place before?

15:37.837 --> 15:40.172
I live at this place.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.574
Really?

15:42.575 --> 15:43.842
Yeah.

15:43.843 --> 15:49.581
Yard bird quickly became
a Miami favorite.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.517
The old joke was James brown

15:51.518 --> 15:54.920
was the hardest working
man in show business.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.888
You make him look lazy.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.724
Producer, a teacher.

15:58.725 --> 15:59.559
Yep.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.327
A D.J.

16:01.328 --> 16:05.597
Technically, I have
16 jobs right now.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.101
Devilled eggs with fresh dill

16:09.102 --> 16:14.406
and trout roll will be so over

16:14.407 --> 16:17.676
next year, but right
now I want more.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.112
Fried beans with pork belly.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.347
This is the perfect thing for a

16:21.348 --> 16:25.051
guy looking to squeeze into a

16:25.052 --> 16:28.120
size 28 Speedo tomorrow
and hit the beach.

16:28.121 --> 16:33.259
What makes the Miami sound
different from the Detroit

16:33.260 --> 16:35.294
sound, the Philadelphia sound,

16:35.295 --> 16:38.597
the New York sound, whatever?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.432
You can't say Philadelphia

16:40.433 --> 16:47.139
has strings in their arrangement

16:47.140 --> 16:50.609
whereas records had
organ in there.

16:50.610 --> 16:57.416
What's called 77 Elvis pancakes?

16:57.417 --> 17:01.120
Chocolate chip pancakes, bourbon

17:01.121 --> 17:09.121
maple syrup, banana compote.

17:13.400 --> 17:18.137
Yard bird's signature fried
chicken comes with spiced

17:18.137 --> 17:21.073
watermelon and cheddar
cheese waffles.

17:21.074 --> 17:26.112
They brine the chicken
17 hours to be exact.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.947
Tender inside and perfectly
crispy on the outside.

17:28.948 --> 17:34.586
To me, I like waffles and I
like chicken, but I don't

17:34.587 --> 17:35.821
understand waffles and
chicken together.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.023
You still don't understand?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.491
I understand people deeply

17:39.492 --> 17:41.427
love them and I do like waffles

17:41.428 --> 17:44.530
and I do like fried chicken.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.598
Put them on separate
plates and I'm okay.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.502
You don't want your
food integrated?

17:50.503 --> 17:58.177
Shrimp and grits, a
Southern classic.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.945
I was reading your book.

17:59.946 --> 18:03.982
Is it Curtis Mayfield you
have bad associations with?

18:03.983 --> 18:11.983
Whenever I hear Curtis
Mayfield, just as a kid, that

18:12.459 --> 18:16.562
particular structure
always frightened me.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.563
Even now?

18:17.564 --> 18:20.899
I'm angry that that
band ever existed.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.086
rodeo clown to that song and

18:41.087 --> 18:44.123
Jethro Tull is my
version of that.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.735

19:19.926 --> 19:22.294
tycoon largely credited with big

19:22.295 --> 19:24.029
the father of modern Florida.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.433
His dream was the Florida east

19:27.434 --> 19:28.967
coast railroad, which would run

19:28.968 --> 19:31.603
from Jacksonville to key west

19:31.604 --> 19:33.305
connecting the ports of Miami to

19:33.306 --> 19:35.207
the rail system of the rest of

19:35.208 --> 19:37.809
the United States, creating

19:37.810 --> 19:43.782
along its route new towns,
new cities, new places where

19:43.783 --> 19:50.622
America's rising middle class
could frolic and play.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.459
As more and more whites moved

19:53.460 --> 19:57.896
in, segregation took hold and

19:57.897 --> 19:59.665
much of the community was forced

19:59.666 --> 20:05.103
into the black neighborhoods
like Overtown.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.639
If you're looking for old Miami,

20:07.640 --> 20:13.345
original Miami, you're looking

this guy makes bootie

Everybody is dancing

standing up on you.

22:43.796 --> 22:48.500
The girls stand up on you
and put your butt on you.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.837
I've seen this on television.

22:51.838 --> 22:59.838
It's no different
than a lap dance.

You ran for office?

23:02.348 --> 23:04.650

23:18.531 --> 23:23.334
How come they keep electing
conservative white guys?

23:23.335 --> 23:25.370
You have a whole
quiet community.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.606
You didn't get them
excited about voting.

23:27.607 --> 23:31.477
It is the opposite of get
out the vote program.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.111
It is don't bother to vote.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.180
Don't bother to vote.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.848
African-Americans voted at 20%.

23:36.849 --> 23:41.219
If we would have voted at 50%,

Best weather.

23:48.228 --> 23:50.896
How do you handle the cold if

23:50.897 --> 23:54.633
you have to tour or something in

23:54.634 --> 23:56.067
Detroit or Chicago or something?

My mind-set is I don't have

23:58.905 --> 24:02.541

I'm going back to sunshine.

have enough tasty stuff from

The band market is
tucked away in the back.

What's the worst thing?

24:52.091 --> 24:55.794
You know what really
pisses me off?

24:55.795 --> 24:59.297
I walk down the street and I say

24:59.298 --> 25:02.801
hi to people and I don't
get a hi back a lot here.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.970
To what do you attribute this?

25:04.971 --> 25:07.573
The transient part of it.

25:07.574 --> 25:11.042
People don't feel rooted.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.979
They are from south
America, central America.

Motown, Philadelphia, New York?

28:46.458 --> 28:52.964

28:54.633 --> 28:58.970
came down from Georgia and
Alabama, but that Bahamian

28:58.971 --> 29:00.305
influence was dominant.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.140
Right.

29:01.141 --> 29:06.644

to Liberty city and
back in big parades.

the moving and the marching,
