00:03.657 --> 00:05.625
Harvard trivia,
the lightning round.

00:05.692 --> 00:06.826
Go.

00:06.894 --> 00:08.261
Pulitzer Prizes.
46.

00:08.328 --> 00:10.012
- Nobel Peace Prizes.
- Five.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.113
What is the oldest book in
the Harvard library collection?

00:12.181 --> 00:13.444
- The Bible.
- Wrong.

00:13.511 --> 00:14.745
The Gutenberg Bible.

00:14.813 --> 00:16.386
Everyone knows
it's the Gutenberg Bible.

00:16.454 --> 00:17.618
Yes, but you didn't say it.

00:17.686 --> 00:19.720
The rules dictate
you must be precise,

00:19.787 --> 00:21.221
as the law is
a very precise endeavor.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.154
- How many U.S. Pr--
- Eight.

00:24.222 --> 00:25.820
That's not fair, you didn't
even finish the question.

00:25.888 --> 00:27.721
And yet it's right.
The question was gonna be

00:27.789 --> 00:29.556
"How many U.S. Presidents
attended Harvard?"

00:29.623 --> 00:31.494
- You want names?
- No, we get it.

00:31.561 --> 00:34.866
Final round.
Ross ahead by one.

00:34.934 --> 00:37.440
One question each.
Points are double.

00:37.508 --> 00:39.609
Double 'cause he wants
to keep you in the game, Seth.

00:39.677 --> 00:41.445
Bring it on, Ross.
I bleed crimson.

00:41.513 --> 00:43.915
Oh, venomous banter.
This is adorable, I love it.

00:43.983 --> 00:46.786
Ross, square pizza.
Where do you get it?

00:49.523 --> 00:50.589
Are you kidding?

00:50.657 --> 00:52.291
Any self-respecting
Harvard alumnus

00:52.358 --> 00:54.159
would know the answer
to that.

00:54.226 --> 00:55.860
Late night studying
and you want square pizza,

00:55.927 --> 00:57.195
where do you go?

00:57.262 --> 00:59.630
Um...

00:59.697 --> 01:01.198
You know,
I'm more of a burger guy.

01:01.266 --> 01:04.000
I study better on protein.

01:06.536 --> 01:08.604
I mean, that's just...
pathetic.

01:08.672 --> 01:09.738
It's Pinocchio's.

01:09.806 --> 01:11.675
Mm, I answer mine, I win.

01:11.743 --> 01:13.110
Yeah, I know.

01:16.450 --> 01:18.085
How many current
U.S. Supreme Court Justices

01:18.153 --> 01:19.486
are from our Alma Mater?

01:19.554 --> 01:22.390
Everybody knows that.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.692
Five.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.695
Hah! See, I told you
Keller was better.

01:25.762 --> 01:27.196
You owe me 20.

01:27.264 --> 01:28.699
- Awesome.
- Got anything to say, Ross?

01:28.766 --> 01:31.334
Nope.
Just that the answer's wrong.

01:31.402 --> 01:34.404
Scalia, Roberts,
Kennedy, Breyer, Kagan.

01:34.471 --> 01:35.872
- Ginsberg.
- Ruth Bader Ginsberg

01:35.939 --> 01:38.707
went to Columbia.
She graduated from Columbia,

01:38.775 --> 01:40.742
after she attended Harvard
for two years.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.344
The question was phrased

01:42.412 --> 01:44.412
"How many justices were
from Harvard?"

01:44.480 --> 01:46.280
Well, she was on
the <i>Harvard Law Review.</i>

01:46.348 --> 01:48.282
And when she arrived
at Columbia as a transfer,

01:48.350 --> 01:49.683
she was from Harvard.

01:49.751 --> 01:52.553
The rules dictate
that you must be precise,

01:52.621 --> 01:55.257
as the law is
a precise endeavor.

01:55.325 --> 01:57.125
Told you Ross was hot.

02:01.966 --> 02:03.266
Congratulations.

02:03.334 --> 02:05.534
This is what you get
for second place.

02:05.602 --> 02:08.705
To the victor belongs
the spoils.

02:08.773 --> 02:11.576
A case.
Pro bono, one of your very own.

02:13.312 --> 02:14.345
Congratulations, enjoy.

02:24.192 --> 02:26.594
Louis knows.

02:26.662 --> 02:28.930
- Louis knows what?
- My dirty little secret.

02:28.998 --> 02:30.398
- You're Canadian?
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:30.466 --> 02:31.867
No, he knows that
I didn't go to Harvard.

02:31.935 --> 02:33.302
No, he doesn't.

02:33.369 --> 02:34.636
How can you
be so sure about that?

02:34.704 --> 02:36.004
Because you're walking
with me right now.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.739
He did this whole
Harvard trivia thing,

02:37.807 --> 02:38.740
and then he brought up
this pizza--

02:38.808 --> 02:40.309
Doesn't mean he knows.

02:40.376 --> 02:41.776
Look,
I think we need to hack

02:41.844 --> 02:42.911
into Harvard's system
or something.

02:42.979 --> 02:44.913
You know, put my records in.

02:44.981 --> 02:46.181
I can't,
I'm booked this weekend.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.116
I'm breaking into Fort Knox.

02:48.184 --> 02:50.051
I gotta return
some stolen doubloons.

02:50.119 --> 02:52.187
Okay, hilarious.
I'm serious.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.523
Listen, nobody's
gonna check into your past

02:54.591 --> 02:57.026
unless you
give them reason to.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.130
Louis is devious,
but he's not bold.

03:00.198 --> 03:01.932
He won't think we did this.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.035
Because he'd never
think to do it himself.

03:04.102 --> 03:06.437
Doubloons?

03:06.505 --> 03:08.239
The ridiculousness of
your suggestion

03:08.307 --> 03:09.408
warranted the use of
a silly word.

03:09.475 --> 03:11.543
Got it.

03:24.460 --> 03:25.927
Was that Quentin Sainz
I just saw leaving?

03:25.995 --> 03:27.195
Mm-hmm.
You know him?

03:27.263 --> 03:28.997
I know of him.

03:29.064 --> 03:31.033
Why was he holding your hands?
Kissing them?

03:31.100 --> 03:32.668
What are
you implying, Harvey?

03:32.735 --> 03:34.369
I don't know, maybe
you two are going steady.

03:34.437 --> 03:37.106
I was implying
that it looked like

03:37.173 --> 03:39.141
he was grateful to you
for taking his case.

03:39.209 --> 03:41.277
Good, 'cause that's
exactly what it was.

03:41.345 --> 03:43.313
That's a bad move.
We may make money

03:43.380 --> 03:45.381
billing out on their defense,
but when we lose--

03:45.449 --> 03:47.684
which we will--it's gonna
hurt us in the long run.

03:47.752 --> 03:51.020
- How do you know we'll lose?
- Because it's my job to know.

03:51.088 --> 03:53.456
And his company's A.L.S.
wonder drug is killing people.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.026
A.L.S. is incurable.

03:56.094 --> 03:57.761
And everyone
who is taking that drug

03:57.828 --> 03:59.396
is going to die anyway.

03:59.463 --> 04:02.132
Hm.
That's your defense?

04:02.199 --> 04:04.734
If he kills them a little
faster, it's a public service?

04:04.802 --> 04:08.905
Our defense is
those allegations are untrue.

04:08.973 --> 04:10.474
He has taken
this story all over town,

04:10.542 --> 04:12.409
and not a single firm thinks
he has a case.

04:12.477 --> 04:14.011
Which is why he came to me.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.880
Because he wants someone
who believes in him.

04:15.948 --> 04:18.416
And what is it exactly
that makes you believe in him?

04:18.483 --> 04:20.218
Well, I got to know
his character pretty well

04:20.286 --> 04:21.420
during the time
that we were married.

04:25.025 --> 04:27.487
Quentin is
expecting you tomorrow.

- You forgot this last night.
- I didn't forget that.

05:11.340 --> 05:14.009
I have no intention of
taking this case.

05:14.076 --> 05:16.411
Though, I did get you this.

05:16.479 --> 05:18.647
- What is it?
- A wedding gift.

05:18.714 --> 05:20.715
I'm sorry it's so late,
but it's hard to be on time

05:20.783 --> 05:23.718
when I never
knew you were married.

05:23.786 --> 05:25.353
Are you
seeing anyone, Harvey?

05:25.421 --> 05:28.122
Hm?

05:28.190 --> 05:29.957
You don't wanna tell me,
and I don't really care.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.593
Because you and I share
the same trait

05:32.661 --> 05:34.194
of keeping our
personal lives personal.

05:34.262 --> 05:35.829
You were married.

05:35.897 --> 05:38.031
It happened when you were at
Harvard, didn't work out.

05:38.099 --> 05:39.966
We were too dedicated
to our careers,

05:40.034 --> 05:42.069
and that's all
I'm going to say about it.

05:42.136 --> 05:43.837
Okay.
You're right.

05:43.905 --> 05:45.939
It's none of my business.

05:46.006 --> 05:48.274
- I'm still not taking this case.
- Why is that?

05:48.342 --> 05:50.976
Because sometimes I do things
that my clients don't like.

05:51.044 --> 05:53.346
And if their ex-wives
are looking over my shoulders,

05:53.414 --> 05:54.781
that's not really a problem.

05:54.849 --> 05:57.917
But when their ex-wives
are also my managing partner,

05:57.985 --> 05:59.819
that hamstrings me.

05:59.887 --> 06:02.489
And if I'm gonna turn
this loser into a winner,

06:02.556 --> 06:04.290
I can't be hamstrung.
I can't have that.

06:06.828 --> 06:08.962
Do what you gotta do.

06:09.030 --> 06:12.165
- You won't interfere?
- What did I just say?

06:12.233 --> 06:15.168
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to develop a new drug

06:15.236 --> 06:18.639
if you're not Pfizer,
or Amgen, or Merck?

06:18.706 --> 06:20.974
This is important, Harvey.

06:21.042 --> 06:24.111
If Quentin came to you looking
for someone to trust him,

06:24.178 --> 06:25.746
why aren't you handling
this case yourself?

06:25.814 --> 06:27.348
That's none of your concern.

06:27.415 --> 06:29.550
Well, I'm not asking you
that as your colleague,

06:29.617 --> 06:32.152
I'm asking you
as Quentin's attorney.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.357
After Quentin and I
separated,

06:38.425 --> 06:42.494
he started seeing
one of his research consultants.

06:42.562 --> 06:44.263
Lisa.
They're still together.

06:44.330 --> 06:46.665
But he never married her.

06:46.733 --> 06:48.100
She doesn't want me
on the case.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.367
Oh, terrific.

06:49.435 --> 06:50.836
You're sticking me with
a losing case,

06:50.903 --> 06:52.137
and a girlfriend
who isn't gonna like me

06:52.205 --> 06:53.672
anymore than she likes you.

06:53.739 --> 06:56.007
Well, I'm sure
it's not the first time

06:56.075 --> 06:57.809
someone hasn't liked you,
Harvey.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.082
Who doesn't like me?

07:03.149 --> 07:04.817
Picture the devil
without the charm.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.685
Okay, so Karinski owned
this building for two years?

07:06.752 --> 07:08.454
Yeah, then things got bad.

07:08.521 --> 07:10.757
Three below, the heat went out
and I nearly froze to death.

07:10.824 --> 07:12.225
Then a gas leak in my stove.

07:12.293 --> 07:14.061
You could smell the damn thing,
but he said it was fine.

07:14.128 --> 07:16.263
I called for a month,
then I had to replace it myself.

07:16.331 --> 07:18.332
Why didn't you just move?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.302
This is the apartment
that I grew up in.

07:20.369 --> 07:21.769
It's the only place
I've ever known.

07:21.837 --> 07:23.771
I don't have
any brothers or sisters.

07:23.839 --> 07:26.174
My parents...
Not with me anymore.

07:26.242 --> 07:29.244
I'm not leaving the
one connection I have to them.

07:29.312 --> 07:32.614
You said you weren't sleeping.
Are you stressed out, or--?

07:32.682 --> 07:34.917
- Bedbugs.
- No.

07:34.984 --> 07:37.252
My place is literally
crawling with them.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.689
Could you sleep knowing the
minute you turn out the light,

07:39.756 --> 07:41.591
they're coming for you?
No, I couldn't.

07:41.659 --> 07:43.694
Well, Karinski won't do
anything about it without proof,

07:43.761 --> 07:44.862
and I can't get someone
from the city down

07:44.930 --> 07:46.197
to verify they're there.

07:46.264 --> 07:49.067
Don't worry.
I can.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.103
Two weeks.
Next Thursday.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.071
I-I-I-I don't think
that you heard me.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.440
I need someone
down there today.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.575
- Two weeks, next Thursday.
- Okay.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.745
Uh, I'd like to speak
to your supervisor, please.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.146
You can do that
next Wednesday.

08:00.214 --> 08:03.283
Okay, Glenda, let me
tell you what I'm gonna do

08:03.351 --> 08:05.084
between now
and next Wednesday...

08:05.152 --> 08:06.586
I know exactly
what you're gonna do.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.254
You're gonna do what
every lawyer threatens to do.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.089
You're gonna
file a 409/3 grievance

08:10.156 --> 08:11.957
claiming that I did
not fulfill my obligation

08:12.025 --> 08:13.458
to promptly direct you
to my supervisor.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.094
A grievance that will
be passed on to my supervisor

08:16.162 --> 08:17.896
next Wednesday.

08:17.963 --> 08:21.733
No, what I'm gonna do
is hire a private investigator

08:21.801 --> 08:24.203
to look into
every aspect of your life

08:24.270 --> 08:26.839
from the day you were born
until next Tuesday.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.075
And then I'm gonna use
whatever it is they find

08:29.143 --> 08:30.977
to make you wish
that your biggest problem

08:31.045 --> 08:35.182
was keeping this job
that you seem to hate so much.

08:36.985 --> 08:39.153
Yeah, I'm not like
every other lawyer, Glenda.

08:39.221 --> 08:40.453
What did you say
your name was?

08:40.522 --> 08:43.256
Specter.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.193
Harvey Specter.

08:50.365 --> 08:51.966
- You're a baseball fan?
- Oh, yeah.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.768
Then I assume you know
Lou Gehrig was a bad man.

08:54.836 --> 08:58.038
They didn't call him
the Iron Horse for nothing.

08:58.106 --> 09:01.074
Then he got A.L.S.
you know what it did to him?

09:01.142 --> 09:03.277
His hands locked up,
then his legs,

09:03.345 --> 09:05.279
his speech,
eventually his breathing.

09:05.347 --> 09:06.547
Couldn't control 'em.

09:06.615 --> 09:09.250
His mind knew what it wanted,
but his body--

09:09.318 --> 09:12.653
he was trapped inside,
unable to do anything.

09:12.721 --> 09:14.089
Even today, you get A.L.S.,

09:14.156 --> 09:15.657
within three to five years,
you die.

09:15.725 --> 09:18.193
Or sooner, if someone takes
your drug and their liver fails.

09:18.261 --> 09:20.829
Our drug makes people's
remaining years better,

09:20.897 --> 09:22.631
and it doubles
their life expectancy.

09:22.699 --> 09:24.332
Except for the people
who's livers are failing.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.368
- You don't--
- Lisa.

09:26.436 --> 09:27.936
It's okay.

09:28.004 --> 09:32.207
I can see why Jessica likes you.
You cut through the bullsh--.

09:32.275 --> 09:35.143
That's something
I always loved about her.

09:35.211 --> 09:37.279
She just does it with
a little less charm than I do.

09:37.346 --> 09:38.847
Isn't she
a little taller than you?

09:38.914 --> 09:40.582
- It's the heels.
- Let me tell you what it takes

09:40.650 --> 09:42.718
to get a drug approved today.

09:42.786 --> 09:44.720
We were $139 million
into development

09:44.788 --> 09:46.956
before we
ever hit the shelves.

09:47.024 --> 09:49.092
We jumped through
every hoop they threw at us,

09:49.159 --> 09:51.294
and we proved our drug
was safe for eight years.

09:51.362 --> 09:52.895
So you're saying
these claims are baseless?

09:52.963 --> 09:55.098
We're talking
about six terminal patients

09:55.165 --> 09:57.066
with a wide array of
medical issues

09:57.133 --> 09:59.635
and they're saying
my company's drug caused this?

09:59.703 --> 10:02.704
They were drinking coffee
on the <i>Titanic.</i>

10:02.772 --> 10:05.641
I don't think that put
Leonardo DiCaprio in the water.

10:05.709 --> 10:07.076
Since Jessica vouched
for you,

10:07.144 --> 10:09.312
I'm gonna go ahead and
believe what you're telling me.

10:09.379 --> 10:11.948
But since these other firms
determined you have exposure,

10:12.016 --> 10:13.816
here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna pay them.

10:13.884 --> 10:15.485
We're gonna pay them
a little bit of money

10:15.552 --> 10:18.521
so you can keep saving lives,
because if we drag this out,

10:18.589 --> 10:20.790
people won't think of your drug
as a way to save lives,

10:20.858 --> 10:24.160
they'll think of it as
a death sentence.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.296
The guy from
the housing department's

10:27.364 --> 10:28.798
gonna be here in
about five minutes.

10:28.866 --> 10:30.533
How did you manage that?

10:30.600 --> 10:31.901
You know, they're
actually pretty receptive

10:31.969 --> 10:34.938
when you explain
the situation to them.

10:35.006 --> 10:37.407
That's what you have to do
to prevent the spread.

10:37.475 --> 10:39.243
I had to get rid of most
of my things--

10:39.310 --> 10:41.478
clothes,
record collection, books.

10:41.546 --> 10:43.280
I had a first edition
<i>Catcher in the Rye,</i>

10:43.347 --> 10:44.748
you know what that was worth?
No.

10:44.816 --> 10:47.884
The bugs can live dormant
for 18 months.

10:47.952 --> 10:49.619
You just have
to throw everything out.

10:52.924 --> 10:54.124
- Frank!
- Karinski.

10:54.192 --> 10:55.592
- You're here.
- Yes.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.427
I live here.
Funny you should mention that,

10:57.495 --> 10:59.095
'cause you haven't
paid rent in four months,

10:59.163 --> 11:01.130
so I wasn't sure.
I haven't paid rent

11:01.198 --> 11:03.066
because you haven't--
Frank has withheld rent

11:03.133 --> 11:05.368
because the apartment
is not habitable.

11:05.436 --> 11:08.071
New York housing code,
sub-chapter two, article four

11:08.139 --> 11:11.274
section 27-20--
Hey, no rent, no apartment.

11:11.341 --> 11:12.975
That's my code.

11:13.043 --> 11:16.145
But if you
want something legal...

11:16.213 --> 11:18.647
there's a court order.
You got three days to get out.

11:18.715 --> 11:20.949
Or the sheriff's department will
empty the place for you.

11:21.017 --> 11:23.519
Have a nice day.

11:34.197 --> 11:36.231
You're late.

11:36.299 --> 11:38.400
Look, it was
Louis' pro bono, I--

11:38.468 --> 11:41.136
Hey, that's my suit.
My extra suit from my office.

11:41.204 --> 11:44.005
Yeah, it's Louis' fault.
I went to the client's place,

11:44.072 --> 11:46.841
it was overrun with bedbugs,
so I went back to the office--

11:46.909 --> 11:48.409
You tracked bedbugs
into my office?

11:48.476 --> 11:50.377
- No.
- You walked in there naked?

11:50.444 --> 11:52.812
No, Donna met me in
the downstairs men's room...

11:52.880 --> 11:55.548
Okay, Donna's fired, and
you're buying me an extra suit.

11:55.616 --> 11:56.616
By the way,
that's a three-piece suit.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.016
Where's the vest?

11:58.084 --> 11:59.652
Yeah, I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.053
Vests? Really?

12:01.121 --> 12:04.223
Says the guy
with the bike helmet.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.559
Uh, safety first.

12:06.627 --> 12:09.396
Come on.

12:15.638 --> 12:19.107
Ah, the house that
Amylinx built.

12:19.175 --> 12:20.609
Nice.
Very nice.

12:20.677 --> 12:24.145
Collin Church, Mr. Sainz
and Mr. Specter,

12:24.213 --> 12:26.715
lately arrived to
our little legal dispute.

12:26.783 --> 12:30.552
You say legal dispute,
I say shakedown.

12:30.619 --> 12:33.288
Always a fine line between
the two, <i>n'est pas?</i>

12:33.356 --> 12:35.190
Look, we can
sit here and posture

12:35.258 --> 12:37.292
about the strengths
and weaknesses of our cases,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.194
but frankly, that's gonna
bore the hell out of me.

12:42.232 --> 12:44.032
Seriously?

12:44.100 --> 12:47.435
- It could be much lower.
- It could be much higher.

12:47.503 --> 12:49.538
Then let's pretend
it's just right.

12:49.605 --> 12:52.907
My client's lives are
being cut short.

12:52.975 --> 12:55.810
And according to
accepted calculations,

12:55.878 --> 12:59.981
the current value of a life
is $7.9 million.

13:00.049 --> 13:03.017
You're not even
offering pennies on that.

13:03.085 --> 13:05.152
Those happen
to be E.P.A. calculations

13:05.220 --> 13:07.221
based on
a full life expectancy.

13:07.289 --> 13:08.723
Adjusted for plaintiffs

13:08.791 --> 13:10.425
who's expectancy
is just a fragment of this,

13:10.493 --> 13:14.729
yields a value of $143,427.

13:16.532 --> 13:17.865
Approximately.

13:17.933 --> 13:21.269
What your child fails
to understand is that

13:21.337 --> 13:24.339
for someone with only
three to five years to live,

13:24.407 --> 13:27.309
each day is
worth infinitely more.

13:27.376 --> 13:30.779
But the real crux
is the punitive damages.

13:30.847 --> 13:34.250
Because if your client
wants to sell me the idea

13:34.318 --> 13:38.188
that he didn't know about
these side effects years ago,

13:38.256 --> 13:39.523
I'm not buying it.

13:39.591 --> 13:42.292
Which is why
we want $250 million.

13:42.359 --> 13:43.793
- What?
- Quentin.

13:43.861 --> 13:46.396
No, man.
This is outrageous.

13:46.463 --> 13:47.597
Do you know what you're doing?

13:47.665 --> 13:49.165
You're bankrupting this company

13:49.233 --> 13:51.234
and taking away years of life
from real people

13:51.302 --> 13:53.503
who are walking, talking,
and breathing easier

13:53.571 --> 13:55.138
because of the drug we make.

13:55.206 --> 13:58.075
I don't represent
those people.

13:58.142 --> 14:00.777
My clients--
Have tenuous claims at best.

14:00.845 --> 14:02.879
And unless one of your six
is Rupert Murdoch,

14:02.947 --> 14:04.948
you're out of your mind.

14:05.016 --> 14:08.185
Okay.

14:11.088 --> 14:12.155
You printed that?

14:12.223 --> 14:14.691
Well, not yet.
But I will.

14:14.759 --> 14:15.926
You realize
that's libelous.

14:15.993 --> 14:17.928
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

14:17.996 --> 14:20.397
But after it runs,
you and I both know,

14:20.464 --> 14:21.898
it won't much matter.

14:21.966 --> 14:24.534
We're done here.
I don't take to extortion.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.469
I'm not gonna be bullied by
an ambulance-chaser,

14:26.537 --> 14:29.306
no matter how nice his suit.
It is nice, isn't it?

14:29.373 --> 14:31.374
Italian.
And it fits.

14:31.441 --> 14:34.911
$250 million, Mr. Sainz.

14:34.978 --> 14:37.813
I'll give you four days.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.590
Church wants to play,
we play.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.727
I have housing court
in the morning.

14:51.794 --> 14:54.096
It's housing court.
Your grandmother could win.

14:54.164 --> 14:56.332
Let's see just how real

14:56.400 --> 14:57.900
his clients'
liver problems are.

14:57.968 --> 14:59.836
Are if they are real,
we suggest they're from

14:59.903 --> 15:02.639
the disease itself,
or they took the wrong dose,

15:02.706 --> 15:05.175
or they took a cocktail
of combined drugs.

15:05.243 --> 15:08.212
Also, I wanna see
Quentin's company financials.

15:08.279 --> 15:09.413
I already
asked for them once.

15:09.481 --> 15:11.148
I want you to call them
and follow-up.

15:11.216 --> 15:13.250
I wanna know everything
Church could go after.

15:13.318 --> 15:16.319
So we've gone from
settlement to scorched earth.

15:16.387 --> 15:19.022
I didn't feel like writing
a $1/4 billion check.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.657
- It's a negotiation.
- Exactly.

15:20.725 --> 15:22.559
That's why I'm arming myself
for the next round.

15:22.627 --> 15:24.427
By digging into Quentin?

15:24.495 --> 15:26.329
I'm a boy scout.
I like to be prepared.

15:26.397 --> 15:28.264
Hmm.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.735
So you think
you'll look like a boy scout

15:32.802 --> 15:34.269
by putting dying people
on the stand

15:34.337 --> 15:35.772
and tearing them apart?

15:35.839 --> 15:36.973
Mm.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.508
You're gonna
look like an asshole.

15:38.576 --> 15:40.610
For every one they claim
has a side effect,

15:40.679 --> 15:42.580
we have 600 who don't.

15:42.648 --> 15:45.550
And if I need to look like
an asshole to convince the jury

15:45.617 --> 15:48.053
that hundreds are
more important than the one,

15:48.120 --> 15:49.921
I'm not gonna lose
a minute's sleep over it.

15:49.989 --> 15:54.426
Well, I have court
in the morning.

15:54.494 --> 15:56.862
Oh, I'm--
I'm not clear.

15:56.929 --> 15:59.298
Was this a conversation with
my managing partner

15:59.365 --> 16:00.832
or my client's ex-wife?

16:00.900 --> 16:03.268
You need to
settle this case, Harvey.

16:03.336 --> 16:05.237
Which I will do
if you stay out of it...

16:05.305 --> 16:08.073
As you promised.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.743
Make it go away.

16:13.113 --> 16:14.347
- Rachel.
- Go away.

16:14.414 --> 16:15.882
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, oh.

16:15.949 --> 16:19.319
Who's picking on you now, Mikey?
Mom and dad are fighting.

16:19.387 --> 16:21.287
Harvey and Jessica.
What do you care?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.923
Oh, I'm just rattled.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.726
My first trial tomorrow
in housing court.

16:25.794 --> 16:27.962
Housing court?

16:28.030 --> 16:30.598
I could win at housing court.
You'll be fine.

16:30.666 --> 16:33.434
But not if you wear that suit.

16:42.810 --> 16:45.545
Carvello versus
Karinski Properties.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.280
So how does
this usually work?

16:47.347 --> 16:51.384
Uh, well, usually
the trial starts,

16:51.451 --> 16:54.286
and there's the judge,
and then...you know,

16:54.354 --> 16:55.988
people say things.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.291
You've never done
this before, have you?

16:58.359 --> 16:59.993
Well,
I never drove a car before

17:00.061 --> 17:02.462
the first time I drove one,
and I'm still here, aren't I?

17:04.433 --> 17:06.233
This is your first time?

17:06.301 --> 17:08.102
I'm your first?

17:08.170 --> 17:11.240
Don't worry, I promise
not to be gentle.

17:11.307 --> 17:13.809
Frank.
It's nice to see you.

17:13.877 --> 17:15.310
One last time.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.013
If it pleases the court--

17:19.082 --> 17:22.483
It pleases the court
to decide who speaks and when.

17:25.221 --> 17:26.887
I'll sit down.

17:26.955 --> 17:29.990
We're talking about $4,000
in withheld rent pas--

17:30.058 --> 17:32.026
Yes, Your Honor.
But we have receipts

17:32.093 --> 17:34.828
for repairs, lost clothing,
as well as...

17:36.364 --> 17:38.265
$4,000.
Yes, Your Honor.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.600
She was talking to me.

17:39.668 --> 17:43.038
Oh.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.807
Why hasn't he paid,
counselor?

17:45.875 --> 17:47.542
Uh, that one was for you.

17:47.610 --> 17:49.144
Bedbugs, Your Honor.

17:49.212 --> 17:52.680
I have receipts that show
my client's financial outlay

17:52.748 --> 17:55.583
to rectify the problem
far exceeds the amount.

17:55.651 --> 17:58.620
Housing department certified
the presence of bedbugs?

17:58.688 --> 18:00.355
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- Abatement?

18:03.726 --> 18:05.594
Excuse me.

18:05.662 --> 18:08.397
I'll do it.
There you go.

18:10.066 --> 18:11.934
Your Honor, this is
an eviction hearing.

18:12.002 --> 18:14.136
The pertinent question is
not habitability,

18:14.203 --> 18:15.771
but whether or not rent
has been paid.

18:15.838 --> 18:19.474
Actually, city code states
that rent may be withheld

18:19.542 --> 18:22.577
if the warranty of
habitability is breached.

18:22.645 --> 18:24.280
Mm.

18:24.347 --> 18:26.182
In that case, we request
to see the checks

18:26.249 --> 18:27.749
Mr. Ross' client
has placed in escrow.

18:27.817 --> 18:31.119
- The--uh...
- Checks, in escrow.

18:31.187 --> 18:32.954
Pending the outcome of
a rent abatement hearing?

18:33.022 --> 18:37.793
- That's not in the code.
- It is the accepted practice.

18:37.861 --> 18:40.496
And therefore
binding in this courtroom.

18:40.564 --> 18:43.567
Your client did put money
in escrow, I assume.

18:43.634 --> 18:44.935
- I didn't have any money left--
- Your Honor...

18:45.003 --> 18:46.603
Eviction upheld.

18:46.671 --> 18:49.206
- But Your Honor, he--
- Did you see me bang the gavel?

18:49.274 --> 18:51.643
That means step aside.
Next case.

18:53.212 --> 18:56.080
You never forget your first.

19:04.022 --> 19:05.389
You know what happens
to pitchers

19:05.456 --> 19:07.024
when they get shelled
in rookie league, Mike?

19:07.092 --> 19:08.792
You think they make it
to the bigs?

19:08.860 --> 19:11.195
Or do they just end up

19:11.263 --> 19:13.398
on some sad American Legion
team of has-beens?

19:13.465 --> 19:15.099
I get it, I lost.
I'm sorry.

19:17.102 --> 19:20.538
Well, you're sorry.

19:20.606 --> 19:23.408
In that case--
No, I am sorry.

19:23.475 --> 19:25.710
But right now I have
some research to do for Harvey,

19:25.778 --> 19:27.645
so if you'll excuse me.
Remember when you stole

19:27.713 --> 19:29.480
that client
I had you bring in?

19:29.548 --> 19:31.015
That was a good time
for you, wasn't it?

19:31.083 --> 19:34.051
See, I gave you a nothing case
so that when you did win

19:34.119 --> 19:37.121
it would still do
nothing for your career.

19:37.188 --> 19:40.558
But I still
expected you to win.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.660
So yeah, I guess...
Go back to your research.

19:43.728 --> 19:45.896
Maybe that is your niche.

19:47.999 --> 19:49.633
Maybe it is.

19:57.508 --> 20:00.643
Most mornings,
I can make it out of the chair

20:00.711 --> 20:03.980
and get across the floor.

20:04.048 --> 20:05.348
And I can hold my daughter.

20:09.153 --> 20:10.987
How many were in the study?

20:11.054 --> 20:14.423
412, over 2 years.

20:14.491 --> 20:16.091
And we have videos of
all of them.

20:16.159 --> 20:18.026
25% were given placebos,

20:18.094 --> 20:20.629
the rest,
varying doses of Amylinx.

20:20.696 --> 20:22.631
And more than half are
like that one,

20:22.698 --> 20:24.399
showing significant
signs of improvement.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.901
And you're telling me there
was nothing affecting the liver?

20:26.968 --> 20:28.536
Yes.

20:28.603 --> 20:32.072
If you're just coming to
question that, we'll move on.

20:32.140 --> 20:35.110
You don't like it that Quentin
went to his ex-wife, do you?

20:35.177 --> 20:37.045
No, I don't.

20:37.112 --> 20:40.282
I don't want any garbage from
the past getting in the way.

20:40.349 --> 20:43.852
I mean, what Quentin's done here
is nothing short of miraculous.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.689
I think I may have found a way
to keep that miracle going.

20:46.757 --> 20:49.425
I was going through
the plaintiff's medical files,

20:49.493 --> 20:52.362
and then I found this.

20:54.031 --> 20:55.899
This is good.

20:55.966 --> 20:57.467
This is really good.

20:57.535 --> 20:59.869
Jones versus Norco...

20:59.937 --> 21:02.371
Washburn versus
Hawthorne Incorporated...

21:02.439 --> 21:05.874
Actually, seven cases
that Mr. Church solicited

21:05.942 --> 21:07.642
lawsuits against
pharmaceutical companies.

21:07.710 --> 21:11.346
In each case, he was able
to exact a settlement

21:11.413 --> 21:13.614
because the company
knew that even if they won,

21:13.682 --> 21:16.851
a protracted battle would
do more damage than settling.

21:16.918 --> 21:18.252
You have evidence of that?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.655
Plaintiff number two
in our case, Eleanor Baker.

21:20.722 --> 21:22.256
She also happens to be

21:22.324 --> 21:24.860
plaintiff number seven in
Jones versus Norco.

21:24.927 --> 21:27.429
He's recycling plaintiffs.
That's very green of you.

21:27.497 --> 21:29.098
Mr. Church?

21:29.166 --> 21:32.369
Mr. Specter has his
documents, I have mine

21:32.437 --> 21:36.073
showing that prior to
FDA approval of his drug,

21:36.141 --> 21:39.443
Quentin Sainz's company
was on the verge of bankruptcy.

21:39.510 --> 21:42.612
Three months after
that drug hit the market,

21:42.680 --> 21:46.016
sales rocketed to
$38 million a quarter,

21:46.084 --> 21:48.452
which is
clear financial motive

21:48.520 --> 21:50.221
for falsifying
clinical trials.

21:50.289 --> 21:52.190
Now, Your Honor,
does that sound like

21:52.258 --> 21:55.160
a groundless claim to you?

21:55.228 --> 21:56.862
I told you
to go over those financials.

21:56.930 --> 21:59.198
I asked him five times,
he never gave them to me.

21:59.266 --> 22:01.634
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Specter,

22:01.701 --> 22:03.870
you can question his tactics
all you like at trial,

22:03.937 --> 22:05.238
but he's right.

22:05.306 --> 22:07.173
That right there is
financial motive for fraud

22:07.241 --> 22:10.143
this case is moving forward.

22:10.211 --> 22:11.678
Thank you, Your Honor.

22:30.971 --> 22:32.171
Jessica,
what're you doing here?

22:32.239 --> 22:33.406
Get in.

22:33.473 --> 22:36.108
I was just about to
get some coffee.

22:44.684 --> 22:46.285
Heard about your
little setback in court.

22:46.353 --> 22:49.021
Getting blind-sided
by my own client holding back

22:49.089 --> 22:50.690
isn't a setback,
it's an embarrassment.

22:50.758 --> 22:52.359
- What are you talking about?
- Did you ever think

22:52.427 --> 22:54.195
it's time to consider that
he isn't the upstanding man

22:54.262 --> 22:56.764
that you think he is?

22:56.832 --> 22:59.968
When we were married...

23:00.036 --> 23:02.004
When I took a client
Quentin knew was guilty,

23:02.072 --> 23:03.439
he never shut up about it.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.875
He went on, and on,
about right and wrong.

23:05.942 --> 23:07.276
Sounds annoyingly
self-righteous.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.644
It was.

23:08.712 --> 23:10.880
But it's also how I know
he didn't do this.

23:10.948 --> 23:14.016
For all his faults, Quentin has
never lied to me before.

23:14.084 --> 23:17.453
And he's not lying about this.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.390
So stop questioning his ethics
and start winning this case.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.525
We had a deal that
you were gonna stay out of it.

23:22.593 --> 23:24.227
You don't know
everything I know.

23:25.797 --> 23:27.731
- All right.
- That's not staying out of it.

23:27.799 --> 23:29.266
No, you're right.

23:29.334 --> 23:31.069
I'm not staying out
of it anymore.

23:40.013 --> 23:41.313
I'm sorry.

23:41.381 --> 23:43.215
You looked into
his background this deeply?

23:43.283 --> 23:45.317
The investigation
reveals what it reveals.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.686
If he lied about this,
he could've lied about anything.

23:47.754 --> 23:49.087
You think I didn't know

23:49.155 --> 23:50.822
he started with Lisa
before we were separated?

23:52.558 --> 23:55.226
This is old news, Harvey.
I moved on a long time ago.

23:55.294 --> 23:57.795
Jessica, it's
a pattern of behavior.

23:57.862 --> 23:59.263
Quentin came to me
because he knew

23:59.331 --> 24:02.399
I thought he was a good man,
and I still do.

24:02.466 --> 24:04.868
You obviously don't.

24:04.936 --> 24:07.037
I'm taking the case.

24:09.441 --> 24:10.541
What about Lisa?

24:10.609 --> 24:12.744
If Lisa has
a problem with it,

24:12.811 --> 24:17.249
then Lisa can
take it up with me.

24:17.316 --> 24:18.450
It's kind of ironic,
isn't it?

24:18.518 --> 24:20.486
You and I both
lost in court yesterday.

24:20.554 --> 24:23.322
You lost...
In housing court?

24:23.390 --> 24:25.391
How does one
lose in housing court?

24:25.459 --> 24:26.926
People win there
without lawyers.

24:26.994 --> 24:28.995
Well, he had a lawyer,
Tanaka, and she--

24:29.063 --> 24:31.164
- Vivien Tanaka?
- Yeah, what, you know her?

24:31.232 --> 24:32.899
If your landlord's
using Vivien Tanaka,

24:32.967 --> 24:34.735
this isn't about bedbugs.

24:34.803 --> 24:37.705
Vivien Tanaka represents half
the high-rises in Manhattan.

24:37.773 --> 24:40.108
This isn't a petty rent dispute.
Your guy's going condo.

24:40.175 --> 24:41.843
Well, that's great.

24:41.911 --> 24:43.912
Forcing Frank out
for conversion is harassment,

24:43.979 --> 24:45.346
I can go after him for that.

24:45.414 --> 24:47.482
No, you wanna
take down Vivien,

24:47.550 --> 24:50.185
you better go in there
with more than just one client.

24:50.252 --> 24:52.320
You show the pattern,
the settlement goes up.

24:52.388 --> 24:53.688
If they did this to him,

24:53.756 --> 24:55.423
I guarantee
they've done this to others.

24:55.491 --> 24:56.958
So I should find other
people in Frank's building?

24:57.026 --> 24:59.628
Think bigger.

24:59.695 --> 25:02.531
Bigger how?

25:07.337 --> 25:09.271
Karinski owns five buildings

25:09.338 --> 25:10.973
and they all used to be
rent-controlled,

25:11.040 --> 25:13.008
but now they go for
a million and a half a unit.

25:13.075 --> 25:14.443
Nice profit margin.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.144
I went to look for
housing department complaints

25:16.212 --> 25:18.080
in the year
prior to his remodel.

25:18.147 --> 25:20.048
In each one of them,
tenants who couldn't

25:20.116 --> 25:21.416
buy into the conversion
ended up with

25:21.484 --> 25:24.152
some complaint--
garbage, heat, air.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.888
All of them, one by one,
Karinski drove them out.

25:26.956 --> 25:28.223
You couldn't get their
names from housing complaints?

25:28.290 --> 25:29.691
No, it gave me some names.

25:29.759 --> 25:32.126
But I need to make this
bigger than just his building.

25:32.194 --> 25:34.128
Look, I only get one hour
off a day for lunch,

25:34.195 --> 25:36.263
and I never take it.
Do you really need me for this?

25:36.331 --> 25:37.765
See these people
who are leaving the building?

25:37.832 --> 25:39.634
Mm-hmm.

25:39.701 --> 25:41.535
The entire building
looks like them.

25:41.603 --> 25:43.638
I know I clean up okay, but...

25:43.706 --> 25:46.140
Mm, you need me
to class you up a bit.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.676
- Not class, but--
- Class.

25:48.744 --> 25:50.278
All right, whatever
gets you through the door.

25:50.346 --> 25:52.046
Come on, are you ready?
Yeah.

25:52.114 --> 25:54.382
Hi, there.
My wife and I

25:54.450 --> 25:55.884
are here to see
some of the new units.

25:55.951 --> 25:58.419
Isn't that right, honey?
Mm-hmm.

25:58.487 --> 26:00.655
So what do you think,
sweetheart?

26:00.723 --> 26:02.390
Hm, it's fine.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.592
But I like the place
on 52nd better.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.328
52nd, that's
awful close to your mother.

26:07.396 --> 26:09.197
No, no, no, we're
not talking about my mother.

26:09.265 --> 26:11.599
Well, I...Look,
it doesn't matter to me,

26:11.667 --> 26:12.834
I mean, I love
being near your mother.

26:12.901 --> 26:15.670
I love your mother.

26:15.737 --> 26:17.138
So why don't you tell us

26:17.205 --> 26:18.405
something about
your little building?

26:18.473 --> 26:19.673
Well,
I think you'll find that

26:19.741 --> 26:21.541
not only are
the amenities top quality,

26:21.609 --> 26:23.343
so are the tenants.
That's good to hear.

26:23.411 --> 26:24.811
Yeah, 'cause
we're not just looking at

26:24.879 --> 26:27.714
buying square footage,
but really put down some roots.

26:27.782 --> 26:29.383
Well, that is such
the right way to look at it.

26:29.450 --> 26:30.617
- Mm.
- Is it?

26:30.685 --> 26:32.052
Yes, and I
think you'll also find

26:32.120 --> 26:33.621
that the people who've
bought here, they're like you.

26:33.688 --> 26:36.524
They're young, ambitious--

26:36.591 --> 26:40.294
Is there a problem?

26:40.362 --> 26:41.729
Any other questions
I can answer?

26:41.797 --> 26:44.965
I'm sorry.
My wife here--my beautiful wife

26:45.033 --> 26:48.002
is just--gets a little
paranoid sometimes, you know?

26:48.070 --> 26:49.503
You wouldn't believe
how long it took her

26:49.571 --> 26:51.438
to just go out with me
in the first place.

26:51.506 --> 26:53.173
Forever.

26:53.241 --> 26:55.876
Are there any other tenants
who've been here for a while,

26:55.943 --> 26:57.377
you know, who might be
able to show us

26:57.445 --> 26:59.178
the ins and outs of the place,
the neighborhood?

26:59.246 --> 27:02.281
Well, the building was
totally renovated two years ago,

27:02.349 --> 27:03.916
so most of
our tenants are newer.

27:03.984 --> 27:05.684
We only reopened in January.

27:05.752 --> 27:07.119
- Mm.
- Mm.

27:07.187 --> 27:08.821
But I think there are

27:08.888 --> 27:10.755
some of
the old tenants who bought in.

27:10.823 --> 27:12.758
You think that we
might be able to speak to them?

27:12.825 --> 27:14.626
- Just to be sure.
- It would really make us

27:14.694 --> 27:16.962
feel more comfortable.

27:17.029 --> 27:19.064
Ow.

27:19.132 --> 27:21.533
She's feisty.

27:21.601 --> 27:25.103
So in love, so in love.
Yes, we are.

27:33.644 --> 27:35.545
You came to me
because you wanted someone

27:35.612 --> 27:37.380
who knows you
always tell the truth.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.615
Well, you don't.
What're you talking about?

27:39.683 --> 27:40.917
Lisa.

27:40.984 --> 27:44.754
I asked you back then
if anything had started

27:44.822 --> 27:46.656
before we were separated.

27:46.724 --> 27:48.692
You said it hadn't
and I believed you.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.561
'Cause I
didn't wanna hurt you.

27:50.629 --> 27:52.029
You wanna
know what hurts me?

27:52.097 --> 27:54.665
I thought it was my ambition
that caused our divorce.

27:54.733 --> 27:56.301
- I never said that.
- No.

27:56.368 --> 27:58.003
But you let me believe it.

27:58.070 --> 28:00.739
I shouldn't have started
with Lisa when I did,

28:00.807 --> 28:02.441
but it happened long after

28:02.509 --> 28:04.310
you and I both
know we weren't working.

28:05.712 --> 28:09.581
Now I'm sorry.

28:09.648 --> 28:11.882
Sorry I didn't have
the courage to tell you then.

28:15.654 --> 28:17.988
- What about now?
- Now?

28:18.055 --> 28:20.357
They're manipulating the facts.

28:20.424 --> 28:23.059
And I'm not going to apologize
just because we happened

28:23.126 --> 28:25.061
to hit it big when I
was about to lose everything.

28:27.097 --> 28:29.498
I'm gonna defend you
either way

28:29.566 --> 28:31.868
because I took this case,
and that's what I do.

28:31.936 --> 28:34.336
But if I'm gonna
stake my reputation on this,

28:34.404 --> 28:36.471
then I need to know
if there are any other lies

28:36.539 --> 28:39.675
that are gonna
come up and sandbag me.

28:39.743 --> 28:41.610
And I need to know right now.

28:47.283 --> 28:49.851
♪ ♪

28:49.919 --> 28:52.353
Thanks.

28:52.421 --> 28:53.954
I see I have
some catching up to do.

28:59.961 --> 29:03.163
People are stupid when
they're young.

29:03.231 --> 29:05.231
Do you wanna know why?
I wanna know why

29:05.299 --> 29:08.068
they're stupid all
the other years of their lives.

29:11.139 --> 29:13.074
Glenfiddich.
Smooth.

29:13.142 --> 29:16.010
That's nice.

29:16.078 --> 29:17.913
You never got married.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.716
Now we're
sharing our personal lives?

29:22.785 --> 29:26.622
"Till death do us part."

29:26.690 --> 29:28.824
I actually believed it.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.660
Did he
falsify the clinical trials?

29:31.728 --> 29:34.530
He says he wouldn't do that.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.099
So why are we drinking?

29:36.167 --> 29:40.303
He says
he wouldn't do that...

29:40.370 --> 29:42.605
Because he
needs the drug to work.

29:46.310 --> 29:49.145
He's dying.

29:51.549 --> 29:54.017
Quentin has A.L.S.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.041
Miss Parker, how long
have you worked for Mr. Sainz?

30:13.042 --> 30:15.443
Well, technically,
I'm an independent consultant.

30:15.511 --> 30:17.712
But I've been a part of
Amylinx from the beginning.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.381
Yes, I imagine you
have been.

30:19.448 --> 30:21.450
We're just trying
to establish your credentials

30:21.518 --> 30:23.352
for testifying for him.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.856
How long have you
known Quentin had A.L.S.?

30:26.924 --> 30:29.093
- From the beginning.
- And how long have you known

30:29.160 --> 30:32.930
Quentin falsified trial results
to get the drug on the market,

30:32.998 --> 30:35.466
to save his own life?
What?

30:35.533 --> 30:36.967
No, he wouldn't do that.

30:37.035 --> 30:40.037
Come on, Lisa,
we're all on the same team here.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.473
We're trying to figure out
how to protect the man you love.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.142
Well, I thought
you believed in him.

30:45.210 --> 30:48.245
You slept with Quentin

30:48.313 --> 30:52.149
while he was married to me.

30:52.217 --> 30:55.353
He said it never happened,
and I believed him.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.822
But I have learned
that he can lie.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.625
So do I believe in him now?
No.

31:04.464 --> 31:05.731
This is damage control.

31:05.798 --> 31:07.132
We're just
trying to protect him.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.835
Because they will find out,
and he will get caught,

31:09.903 --> 31:12.404
and if you don't
tell us the real facts,

31:12.471 --> 31:14.873
we can't mitigate
the damage from his lie.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.409
But he didn't lie.

31:17.477 --> 31:18.977
I swear.

31:19.045 --> 31:22.147
He didn't.
But you did, didn't you?

31:22.215 --> 31:24.816
He was sick,

31:24.884 --> 31:26.251
he needed the drug,

31:26.318 --> 31:29.053
and you would've done anything
for FDA approval.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.890
Come on, Lisa,
help us help him.

31:34.260 --> 31:37.429
You didn't
see what he was like.

31:37.497 --> 31:40.232
He was...
barely Quentin then.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.834
And then he got better.

31:41.902 --> 31:44.670
And I've never
seen anything like it.

31:44.738 --> 31:47.040
I was the one to see it.

31:47.108 --> 31:49.909
See what, exactly?

31:49.977 --> 31:53.313
6 months in,
1 person out of the 100

31:53.381 --> 31:55.715
started showing
signs of liver damage.

31:55.783 --> 31:57.483
And that would
jeopardize approval.

31:57.550 --> 31:58.784
Yeah, and I couldn't
take that chance,

31:58.852 --> 32:00.586
so I took the person
out of the study.

32:00.654 --> 32:02.288
You never told Quentin?

32:02.356 --> 32:04.290
No, he would've waited,
and we didn't have the time.

32:04.358 --> 32:06.526
He didn't have the time.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.495
And I love him.

32:09.563 --> 32:11.197
So what else could I do?

32:14.067 --> 32:15.467
Look, there is
an upside to all of this.

32:15.535 --> 32:16.802
Upside?

32:16.870 --> 32:19.372
To the fact that I
unknowingly defrauded the FDA?

32:19.440 --> 32:21.274
Well, the key word
is unknowingly.

32:21.342 --> 32:23.543
Lisa's an outside contractor.

32:23.611 --> 32:25.979
The company may be
liable for actual damages,

32:26.047 --> 32:28.149
but we can shift the blame
for the fraud to Lisa.

32:28.216 --> 32:29.583
There'd be a small payment,

32:29.651 --> 32:30.951
but you might be able
to keep the drug on the market.

32:31.019 --> 32:32.152
And throw Lisa under the bus?

32:32.220 --> 32:34.421
She was throwing you
under the bus.

32:34.489 --> 32:36.190
She was trying to
save my life.

32:40.062 --> 32:41.562
Would there
be criminal charges?

32:41.630 --> 32:44.265
Possibly.
She should get her own lawyer.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.833
It's a conflict for us.

32:45.901 --> 32:47.602
Look, our goal is
to protect you.

32:47.669 --> 32:50.505
Sh...I don't know.

32:53.374 --> 32:56.577
There is an alternative.

32:56.645 --> 32:58.646
You can join Church's lawsuit.

32:58.713 --> 33:01.048
Jessica,
we're lawyers for the company.

33:01.116 --> 33:02.750
We can't advise him to do that.

33:02.818 --> 33:04.685
- Harvey, this is his life.
- That's not the point.

33:04.753 --> 33:06.720
This is my case, my call.

33:06.788 --> 33:09.323
Wait, wait, wait.
What would that mean?

33:09.391 --> 33:12.359
Sainz pharmaceuticals
would go down,

33:12.427 --> 33:14.562
but you'd share in
the settlement.

33:14.629 --> 33:16.063
You could open a new company,

33:16.130 --> 33:18.465
keep the drug alive under
a different corporate umbrella.

33:18.533 --> 33:19.934
I'm not pretending
I'm one of them.

33:20.001 --> 33:23.504
You are one of them.

33:23.572 --> 33:26.507
Look, I can't do that.
It's not who I am.

33:26.574 --> 33:27.908
Now isn't there another way?

33:27.976 --> 33:31.345
You are one of them.

33:31.413 --> 33:32.613
And they're one of you.

33:37.419 --> 33:40.554
Mike, we got work to do,
where are you?

33:40.622 --> 33:43.491
Oh, I'm looking at you
right now in conference room C.

33:43.559 --> 33:46.293
I'm sorry,
can you please excuse me?

33:46.361 --> 33:48.829
Aa meeting?
Here in the office?

33:48.897 --> 33:50.297
Funny.
No, it's my lawsuit.

33:50.365 --> 33:52.233
- Which suit is that?
- Against Johnny Karinski.

33:52.301 --> 33:54.035
Between Frank's building

33:54.103 --> 33:55.937
and the one Rachel and I
are about to buy into.

33:56.005 --> 33:58.039
Oh, yeah.
We're married.

33:58.107 --> 33:59.375
It's a long story.

33:59.442 --> 34:01.143
Look, you said
think bigger, right?

34:01.211 --> 34:03.413
I tracked down
15 former tenants

34:03.480 --> 34:06.315
who are willing to testify
to all manner of harassment

34:06.383 --> 34:07.550
that forced them
out of their apartments.

34:07.618 --> 34:08.851
You did this overnight?

34:08.918 --> 34:10.585
Yeah, I couldn't
sleep anyway.

34:10.654 --> 34:12.355
Kept thinking I felt bedbugs.

34:12.422 --> 34:14.925
But I can get these people
in front of a judge

34:14.992 --> 34:16.860
to tell their story,
and there is no way

34:16.928 --> 34:19.862
that Vivien Tanaka can spin
this to save Karinski's ass.

34:19.931 --> 34:22.632
You should hear their stories.

34:22.699 --> 34:26.101
It'd break your heart.
Uh, if you had a heart.

34:26.170 --> 34:27.737
Emotion is fine,

34:27.804 --> 34:30.107
but you better have some cold,
hard facts to back it up.

34:30.174 --> 34:32.175
Because Vivien Tanaka
is no pushover.

34:32.243 --> 34:34.011
But...

34:34.078 --> 34:36.380
It's good work.
Keep at it.

34:36.447 --> 34:38.348
I'm gonna go do
what I gotta go do.

34:45.156 --> 34:48.592
We need more.

34:48.659 --> 34:50.027
How're we gonna get more?

34:53.331 --> 34:54.665
Mike?

34:54.733 --> 34:56.167
Is this the building
we were in yesterday?

34:56.235 --> 35:00.472
No rent, no apartment.
That's my code.

35:00.540 --> 35:03.876
Uh, yeah.
Before and after.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.048
We need to
go carpet shopping.

35:11.452 --> 35:13.319
I see you found my ad.

35:13.387 --> 35:15.621
Trying to steal
my thunder, Harvey?

35:15.689 --> 35:17.322
Business school 101,

35:17.390 --> 35:19.458
you have a crisis,
you acknowledge the problem.

35:19.526 --> 35:21.993
You wanna be Tylenol,
not Toyota.

35:22.061 --> 35:24.863
A little late for you
to acknowledge this is a crisis.

35:29.535 --> 35:30.769
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:30.836 --> 35:33.071
thank you very much
for coming here today.

35:33.138 --> 35:35.573
Quentin Sainz placed this ad

35:35.641 --> 35:37.475
because your lawsuit
made it clear

35:37.542 --> 35:41.045
that his drug had side effects
that he didn't know about.

35:41.113 --> 35:43.781
We wanted to know how
widespread this problem was.

35:43.849 --> 35:46.218
We had an
outpouring of response.

35:46.285 --> 35:50.022
Not from people
struggling like yourselves,

35:50.089 --> 35:52.424
but from people desperate
to keep the drug available.

35:54.628 --> 35:56.696
You think we're lying.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.697
You're here because
you think this company

35:58.765 --> 36:00.399
has been hiding things
from you.

36:00.467 --> 36:03.569
And you're right.
They have.

36:03.636 --> 36:06.438
But Quentin wants to come clean.

36:06.506 --> 36:07.873
He wants to show you

36:07.941 --> 36:09.608
exactly what it is
that he's been hiding.

36:12.345 --> 36:15.814
I can't really open it.
I can't hold anything,

36:15.882 --> 36:18.884
and I don't know how
much longer I can keep working.

36:18.951 --> 36:22.354
It'll get better, it will.

36:22.421 --> 36:24.389
You know it will.

36:24.457 --> 36:27.993
I guess.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.862
I bet my life on it.

36:33.767 --> 36:37.470
It's not fair you
got A.L.S. In the first place.

36:37.538 --> 36:39.939
And it's definitely
not fair you had side effects

36:40.007 --> 36:42.108
from the drug I created
and I didn't.

36:42.176 --> 36:47.680
But now that I know they exist,
I wanna fix them.

36:47.748 --> 36:52.118
So that people like you...

36:52.186 --> 36:56.055
And maybe even you,
can have what I have right now.

36:56.123 --> 36:57.824
But he can't.

36:57.892 --> 36:59.993
He can't if he gives you
what you're asking.

37:00.061 --> 37:02.995
We're not saying that
you don't deserve compensation.

37:03.063 --> 37:05.599
Our commitment to you
is this.

37:05.666 --> 37:09.969
We are offering you partial
ownership in his company.

37:10.037 --> 37:12.772
A company that is
trying to save lives.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.675
Money isn't going
to help you live longer.

37:15.743 --> 37:18.478
Taking the deal,
and letting Quentin

37:18.546 --> 37:21.014
try and fix the problem
could.

37:21.082 --> 37:22.649
Like it or not...

37:22.717 --> 37:25.319
You're all in the same boat.

37:25.386 --> 37:27.287
Give
Quentin the opportunity

37:27.355 --> 37:30.090
to keep that boat
from sinking.

37:48.427 --> 37:51.062
They really took the offer.

37:51.130 --> 37:52.990
Uh-huh,
Church didn't like it.

37:52.991 --> 37:54.992
But they didn't like Church.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.027
They liked you.
Hm.

37:57.095 --> 37:58.896
And me.

37:58.963 --> 38:01.698
Who wouldn't?

38:01.766 --> 38:03.299
Oh, your mother was
never a fan.

38:03.367 --> 38:04.867
You wanna know the truth,

38:04.935 --> 38:06.502
my father wasn't
much of a fan either.

38:06.570 --> 38:09.372
Now that is a lie
and I know it.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.073
Yeah.
The real truth is,

38:11.141 --> 38:12.775
they'd both take
you over Lisa in a minute.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.688
I'm sorry.

38:24.756 --> 38:27.592
I'm sorry too.

38:30.395 --> 38:34.699
From now on...
back to no more lies.

38:34.767 --> 38:38.069
Well,
if we're gonna do that...

38:38.137 --> 38:41.239
You remember that time
that your Jag got sideswiped

38:41.307 --> 38:42.607
when it was
parked outside the house?

38:42.675 --> 38:44.476
Yeah.

38:44.544 --> 38:46.411
Yeah, it didn't
exactly go down that way.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.118
I was mad.

38:52.185 --> 38:53.285
You were mad?

38:58.625 --> 39:00.726
Oh, you brought a sack lunch.
We would've shared.

39:00.793 --> 39:02.694
Amusing.

39:02.761 --> 39:04.229
As was this,
your little lawsuit.

39:05.665 --> 39:07.599
Take your sack of presents
and run, kid.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.000
You're in way over your head.

39:09.068 --> 39:11.002
Oh, I think
he'll be just fine.

39:11.070 --> 39:13.638
- Hello, Vivien.
- Hello.

39:13.705 --> 39:15.572
So the rookie
called in the veteran.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.674
No, no,
I'm just here to watch.

39:17.742 --> 39:19.409
I love spectator sports.

39:19.477 --> 39:22.245
You enjoy watching the Yankees
destroy a little league team?

39:22.313 --> 39:23.780
David and Goliath
happens to be

39:23.847 --> 39:25.314
one of my favorite stories.

39:25.382 --> 39:29.185
Okay, I'll bite.
What's in the bag?

39:33.591 --> 39:35.659
Hey, hey, what're you doing?

39:35.727 --> 39:37.428
Oh, do you recognize
this carpet?

39:37.496 --> 39:39.063
Make him get that out of here.

39:39.131 --> 39:40.832
This is your
own carpet, Mr. Karinski.

39:40.899 --> 39:42.334
It's from
Frank Carvello's apartment.

39:42.401 --> 39:46.371
Come on.
Feel the fibers, the texture,

39:46.439 --> 39:49.307
it's almost alive.
You brought bedbugs in here.

39:49.375 --> 39:51.910
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's vandalism, assault.

39:51.978 --> 39:53.946
You know, I'm happy
that you put it that way,

39:54.013 --> 39:56.314
because that's what we're gonna
be charging your client with.

39:56.382 --> 39:57.816
What are you talking about?

39:57.884 --> 40:00.686
He didn't just fail to
eradicate a bedbug infestation,

40:00.753 --> 40:02.654
he actually created one.

40:02.722 --> 40:05.357
Yeah, he pulled the carpet
from one of his old buildings--

40:05.425 --> 40:07.026
carpet that was already
infested--

40:07.094 --> 40:09.461
and then he reinstalled it
in my client's apartment

40:09.529 --> 40:11.664
to drive him out.
That's crazy.

40:11.732 --> 40:13.700
You might wanna warn
your client about perjury.

40:13.767 --> 40:15.969
We've got sworn testimony
from the installer.

40:16.036 --> 40:18.871
And a picture of
the same carpet

40:18.939 --> 40:21.941
from one of his old buildings
before it was renovated.

40:22.009 --> 40:24.177
By the way,
my wife and I really love

40:24.245 --> 40:26.612
what you've
done with the place.

40:26.680 --> 40:28.448
So it looks like
we're talking about, what?

40:28.515 --> 40:33.119
Assault, violations of
rental codes, health codes,

40:33.187 --> 40:36.489
and you know, just
basic codes of human decency.

40:36.557 --> 40:38.791
And if a jury in
New York heard all that,

40:38.859 --> 40:40.593
wow, imagine the damages.
Harvey...

40:40.660 --> 40:41.961
Spectate, please.

40:42.028 --> 40:43.595
Just get that carpet
out of here.

40:43.663 --> 40:45.798
So, Vivien...

40:45.866 --> 40:48.101
How am I doing for
my first time?

40:48.169 --> 40:50.136
This still counts as
my first time, doesn't it?

40:52.807 --> 40:55.275
Now let's talk about how much
this is going to cost you.

41:04.654 --> 41:07.924
Yes?

41:07.992 --> 41:09.292
Just thought
you'd like to know,

41:09.359 --> 41:12.361
your case, the pro bono...
I won.

41:12.429 --> 41:14.497
How exciting for you.

41:14.564 --> 41:15.864
But like I said,
it's just a pro bono case,

41:15.932 --> 41:17.233
it's not gonna help your career.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.167
I did also manage
to sign 15 new clients

41:19.235 --> 41:21.070
who are all suing
for the same harassment,

41:21.138 --> 41:22.338
and they will be paying.

41:22.406 --> 41:24.640
So you can multiply
this number...

41:24.708 --> 41:28.110
Times 15.

41:28.177 --> 41:29.377
That's not bad for
rookie league.

41:32.114 --> 41:33.748
Come on.

41:33.816 --> 41:36.150
Tell me that wasn't worth
missing your lunch hour for.

41:36.218 --> 41:38.252
Mm, it makes me
proud to be your wife.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.154
Yeah, wait,
what is that coming up?

41:40.222 --> 41:41.989
Is that our third,
or our fourth anniversary?

41:42.057 --> 41:44.258
It's our fifth.
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

41:44.326 --> 41:46.093
Yeah.
In fact, I think that

41:46.161 --> 41:47.628
we should have
a date night to celebrate.

41:47.695 --> 41:48.962
You're funny.

41:49.030 --> 41:50.097
Hey.

41:50.165 --> 41:53.000
I'm serious.

42:00.109 --> 42:02.845
I can't date anyone
from the office.

42:04.848 --> 42:07.716
You--
