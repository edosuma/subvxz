33:17.266 --> 33:19.467
(tires screeching)

33:23.139 --> 33:26.006
(narrator) On September 20th, 1926,

33:26.042 --> 33:28.509
Al Capone's biggest rivals,

33:28.545 --> 33:31.612
Irish gangsters Hymie
Weiss and Bugs Moran,

33:31.648 --> 33:33.314
try to gun him down,

33:33.349 --> 33:37.584
to avenge the death of Dean O'Banion.

33:37.619 --> 33:41.455
(Deidre Capone) There were
over 2,000 machine gun bullets

33:41.490 --> 33:43.623
that were shot through the
windows and the walls

33:43.659 --> 33:46.259
so that some people were hurt,

33:46.294 --> 33:49.730
some bystanders, innocent
people were hurt.

33:51.131 --> 33:53.766
(narrator) News of
the drive-by shooting

33:53.801 --> 33:56.402
makes Chicago headlines.

34:01.308 --> 34:04.443
This was not a quiet assassination

34:04.479 --> 34:05.644
in the dead of night

34:05.680 --> 34:07.412
that nobody was supposed to know about.

34:07.447 --> 34:10.982
This was deliberately
done in a very public way.

34:11.016 --> 34:15.319
Moran and Weiss are not
only attempting to kill Capone,

34:15.355 --> 34:17.755
they're attempting to send a message

34:17.791 --> 34:20.458
beyond the underworld to the entire city

34:20.494 --> 34:23.460
that Capone is persona non Grata

34:23.496 --> 34:25.429
to what's left of the Irish gangs.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.532
And it's their
intention to take him out.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.382
So, what now?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.583
(Ricca) We need to take
control of the situation

34:48.620 --> 34:52.621
and make peace on our terms.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.188
They don't want peace.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.190
They want us six feet under.

34:56.226 --> 34:59.494
Next time, we might not be so lucky.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.662
And what do you suggest?

35:00.697 --> 35:02.163
(Accardo) Take the whole crew out.

35:02.198 --> 35:03.865
(Nitti) Let's not make
any rash decisions,

35:03.901 --> 35:04.999
all right?

35:05.035 --> 35:06.200
We should think this through.

35:06.236 --> 35:07.836
(Ricca) We go all out full force

35:07.871 --> 35:09.137
and get ourselves killed?

35:09.172 --> 35:10.972
Use your brain for once, all right?

35:11.007 --> 35:12.707
I am using my brain.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.543
I'm thinking about Al's safety.

35:14.578 --> 35:17.711
Enough, I'm not
going to sit here and wait.

35:17.747 --> 35:20.113
We need to hit them, hit them hard.

35:21.717 --> 35:23.451
We'll show them...

35:23.486 --> 35:26.554
who owns this town once and for all.

35:26.589 --> 35:28.556
Starting with Weiss.

35:28.591 --> 35:29.723
Is that clear?

35:29.759 --> 35:30.925
We'll get it done.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.659
(Capone) Sons of bitches.

35:38.542 --> 35:41.067
(Robert Lombardo) Violence is
critically important to the mob.

35:41.102 --> 35:43.169
Essentially, you crossed
them, you were dead.

35:43.204 --> 35:45.204
Bottom line.

35:45.239 --> 35:48.475
If you go to those
extremes to eliminate Capone,

35:48.510 --> 35:50.642
there's gonna be retaliation.

36:06.926 --> 36:08.559
(narrator) To take out Weiss,

36:08.595 --> 36:12.463
Accardo brings on one
of Capone's top hitmen,

36:12.499 --> 36:14.866
Jack McGurn.

36:17.236 --> 36:20.104
(John Binder) Jack McGurn, known
as "Machine Gun" Jack McGurn,

36:20.139 --> 36:23.273
was born in Sicily as Vincenzo Gibaldi.

36:23.309 --> 36:25.809
Jack McGurn was the name he boxed under,

36:25.844 --> 36:27.477
because he had about six or seven

36:27.513 --> 36:29.178
professional fights.

36:29.214 --> 36:31.447
But, by about 1926,

36:31.483 --> 36:33.683
he becomes the top
killer in the Capone gang.

36:40.058 --> 36:43.458
(narrator) But getting
to Weiss won't be easy.

36:43.494 --> 36:45.160
He's trailed constantly

36:45.195 --> 36:48.430
by up to five bodyguards...

36:48.465 --> 36:51.534
and knows Capone is after him.

37:05.882 --> 37:08.016
Now what?

37:08.051 --> 37:09.918
We wait.

37:16.950 --> 37:19.783
(narrator) Under
orders from Al Capone...

37:19.819 --> 37:23.187
Tony Accardo and Jack
McGurn have positioned themselves

37:23.222 --> 37:26.123
outside of Hymie Weiss' headquarters.

37:28.894 --> 37:31.561
But after days of surveillance,

37:31.597 --> 37:33.130
Weiss has yet to show.

37:40.805 --> 37:43.106
(Frank Calabrese) I
know a lot of hitmen.

37:43.141 --> 37:46.075
I've known a lot of
men that have killed.

37:46.111 --> 37:48.044
And there wasn't

37:48.079 --> 37:50.713
"Let's hop in the car and go get it."

37:50.749 --> 37:53.348
There was major, major surveillance

37:53.383 --> 37:57.252
that you don't hear a lot about.

37:57.287 --> 37:59.721
I'm talking about guys sitting in a box,

37:59.757 --> 38:01.857
in a van with little
holes cut out in a box,

38:01.892 --> 38:04.126
with an empty gallon
jug to pee in there,

38:04.161 --> 38:07.295
with sandwiches, and sit
there to survey people for hours.

38:27.649 --> 38:29.482
He's coming.

39:14.928 --> 39:18.561
(narrator) Just two weeks after
his attempted hit on Al Capone...

39:19.965 --> 39:22.132
Hymie Weiss is gunned down.

39:23.869 --> 39:27.503
(T.J. English) He was gunned
down by Capone's people

39:27.539 --> 39:30.207
right in front of the
very same flower shop

39:30.242 --> 39:33.810
where Dean O'Banion had been
murdered years earlier.

39:33.845 --> 39:36.478
And that was no accident.

39:36.513 --> 39:39.681
(narrator) Al Capone's
first big hit as mob boss

39:39.717 --> 39:42.218
makes headlines across the country.

39:43.721 --> 39:45.454
Another example of the escalating

39:45.489 --> 39:48.157
gangland violence in Chicago.

39:50.328 --> 39:53.328
But instead of keeping a low profile,

39:53.363 --> 39:56.331
Capone does the unexpected.

39:59.602 --> 40:01.635
(Capone) Good morning.

40:01.671 --> 40:04.005
I just wanna thank you all
for coming out this morning.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.607
I just wanna answer a few questions.

40:06.642 --> 40:09.243
(reporter) Mr. Capone, police
say that your fingerprints

40:09.278 --> 40:10.978
are all over this Hymie Weiss murder.

40:11.013 --> 40:13.280
Now, I just want to say

40:13.315 --> 40:15.648
I'm sorry Hymie Weiss was killed,

40:15.684 --> 40:18.651
and even though I had
nothing to do with it,

40:18.687 --> 40:21.288
I knew I would be blamed.

40:21.323 --> 40:22.990
I don't want to die in the streets

40:23.025 --> 40:25.124
punctured by machine gun fire.

40:25.159 --> 40:27.126
Now, there's enough business
here for all of us

40:27.161 --> 40:30.096
without killing each other
in the streets like animals.

40:30.131 --> 40:34.267
I have a boy, Sonny.

40:34.302 --> 40:36.235
He's seven years old.

40:36.271 --> 40:40.406
I just wanna make this a
safe and decent place for him.

40:40.441 --> 40:42.173
For all of us.

40:44.311 --> 40:48.246
Al set up one of the
biggest hits of all time

40:48.282 --> 40:50.081
out there in the street.

40:50.117 --> 40:53.751
I mean, this was an amazing hit.

40:53.787 --> 40:56.587
For him to stand up and
just be in total denial

40:56.623 --> 40:59.256
and talk to the press, this
was part of who he was.

40:59.292 --> 41:01.992
I think we've all seen enough
bloodshed in the streets,

41:02.028 --> 41:05.296
and we'd all just like
to get back to business,

41:05.331 --> 41:06.563
making Chicago

41:06.598 --> 41:08.799
the greatest city in the world.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.435
Huh?

41:18.410 --> 41:20.043
(narrator) With Weiss eliminated,

41:20.078 --> 41:22.345
what's left of O'Banion's organization

41:22.380 --> 41:24.047
falls to Bugs Moran,

41:24.082 --> 41:27.550
and he decides to lay
low in Irish territory,

41:27.585 --> 41:31.254
waiting to plan his
next move against Capone.

41:35.592 --> 41:38.961
By wiping out nearly
all of his Irish rivals,

41:38.996 --> 41:41.196
Capone consolidates his power,

41:41.231 --> 41:44.266
controlling more
territory than ever before.

41:46.503 --> 41:49.037
(Vincent Pastore) Territory is power.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.105
Whether in war,

41:51.140 --> 41:54.342
where Hitler wanted to take over Europe,

41:54.377 --> 41:56.477
or in Capone's life,

41:56.512 --> 41:59.613
where he wanted to take
over all of Chicago.

42:05.488 --> 42:08.021
(narrator) Now, Capone is determined

42:08.056 --> 42:11.257
to return his operations to Chicago

42:11.293 --> 42:12.825
and to take his rightful place

42:12.861 --> 42:16.129
as king of the Chicago underworld.
