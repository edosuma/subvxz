01:43.603 --> 01:45.637
- How's the baby thing coming?

01:45.639 --> 01:46.872
- Nothing yet.

01:48.408 --> 01:52.478
What are the odds two
Latinos can't get pregnant?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.646
We're gonna go see a specialist.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.315
Get some fertility drugs.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.516
- You know a woman
in Houston did that,

01:57.518 --> 01:58.617
and she had septuplets.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.385
- Septuplets, holy shit.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.387
- Yeah.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.456
- How many is it?

02:04.458 --> 02:05.491
- Seven.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.859
- Seven holy shit.

02:08.527 --> 02:09.828
- Yeah each of them
weighed 18 ounces.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.864
- I eat steaks bigger than that.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.532
- Psst, 7 'o clock.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.706
I get first shot.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.143
Morning deer.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.580
- I thought it was on vibrate.

02:28.582 --> 02:29.882
Hello.
- Louis.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.527
- I'm sure he'll
be here any minute.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.929
- He's got the truck mom.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.799
It wouldn't kill you to
go somewhere without him.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.669
- I go lots of
places without him.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.671
- Right.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.574
- All right let's just go.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.312
Lance get off the
RV we're leaving.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.580
Come on.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.580
- Trying to figure out
where to put the dish.

03:02.582 --> 03:03.815
- We're not
getting a satellite dish.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.617
- Ah come on mom they're free.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.885
- Nothing's free Lance.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.855
Now get down before
you break your neck.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.794
- There it is, man oh man.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.863
- Oh not this grace
land shit again.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.832
Cyrus Rockford is not the king.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.734
- He's the king around here.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.436
Called Presley Tennessee.

03:24.438 --> 03:27.839
- Well Rockford ain't
exactly Memphis.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.374
You think he's really dead
and people are just pretending

03:29.376 --> 03:30.876
he's alive.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.877
- Elvis?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.378
- Cyrus.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.547
- That is such a
ridiculous rumor.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.549
- Yeah but no one's
seen the guy in years.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.618
I mean isn't that strange?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.320
- Yeah of course it's strange.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.656
Maybe he's got one of those
Howard Hugh things going on.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.659
- All that money must
just rot your brain.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.797
- Oh shit.

03:54.701 --> 03:55.767
- Would you stop that?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.903
It's getting old.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.505
- You get a much closer
view through this thing.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.507
Oh yeah.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.477
- Quit it perv.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.485
- Thank you buddy.
- Yep.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.921
- I'm sorry hun,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.422
I lost track of the time.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.890
- Yeah I know hunting
is Glenn time,

04:18.892 --> 04:19.825
but you really need to...
- I texted you.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.293
- Yeah I know you texted me

04:21.295 --> 04:23.295
when the game was over.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.897
- Hey did we win?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.299
- 13, nine.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.700
Kieth recorded it.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.900
- All right.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.437
Well I can watch it back later.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.780
- I drew a bath for you.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.715
- It's Sunday honey.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.018
Supposed to be a day of rest.

04:47.287 --> 04:47.886
And you know you're
not supposed to call me

04:47.888 --> 04:49.388
when we're hunting.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.291
- But I'm in the
middle of my cycle.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.859
My eggs are ready.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.626
- So are mine.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.030
- Didn't you have
breakfast this morning?

04:58.032 --> 04:59.798
- Yeah about two hours ago.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.632
I mean it's almost

05:00.634 --> 05:01.733
lunch.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.739
I feel like a piece of meat.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.341
- I'm hungry.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.776
Ooh oh there he is.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.426
- I was thinking since
we're not going to break up

05:27.428 --> 05:28.360
in the next three weeks,

05:28.362 --> 05:30.762
why do we have to wait?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.432
- We've been going out
for over 11 months Kieth,

05:33.434 --> 05:34.466
what's three more weeks?

05:34.468 --> 05:35.468
- Exactly.

05:37.437 --> 05:38.704
- I told you I wanted to wait

05:38.706 --> 05:40.706
until we'd been
going out for a year.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.375
You can wait a little longer.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.748
Maybe I can tide you
over for a while.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.891
- Oh yes.
- You'll wake my parents.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.628
- Thanks hun.

06:05.431 --> 06:06.365
- Breakfast Sandy.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.834
- I'll pick something up later.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.834
- Sit down and eat Sandra.
- Mom.

06:10.836 --> 06:13.105
- I know what goes on with
you girls and your dieting,

06:13.107 --> 06:15.707
no daughter of mine is
going to be anorexic.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.809
- I'm not anorexic.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.945
You're so clueless.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.847
- She's definitely not anorexic.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.081
I've seen her naked.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.816
- Lance you're not helping.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.017
- Lance close your
mouth when you chew

06:26.019 --> 06:27.452
for gods sake.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.988
You sound like an
air compressor.

06:30.924 --> 06:31.924
- Later.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.729
- All right the three
branches of the us government,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.698
what are they?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.866
Kristen.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.802
- Republican, democrat
and independent.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.906
- Those are three
political parties.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.976
Executive, legislative,
and judiciary.

06:50.978 --> 06:51.977
All right, all right.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.479
Let's start with
the legislative.

06:54.481 --> 06:58.483
What two bodies make up
the legislative branch?

07:00.653 --> 07:01.853
- Men and women.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.956
- Kristen I'm starting to
think you fell out of the crib

07:04.958 --> 07:06.158
when you were a baby.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.827
Now come on someone's
got to know this.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.962
How about you Sandy?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.631
Come on Keely.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.499
20 years ago I took this
same class with your momma,

07:14.501 --> 07:16.802
and by the way she was
a straight a student.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.971
Some of her must have
rubbed off on you now.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.640
- Well I sure hope not,

07:21.642 --> 07:25.844
otherwise I'd be at home
now making my brothers bed.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.614
- What up Lance?

07:29.616 --> 07:30.482
- What up Timmy.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.683
- You bring it?

07:31.685 --> 07:32.918
- I couldn't find the key.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.952
- So full of shit.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.153
- Dude I'm telling you,

07:35.155 --> 07:37.589
he got it in a gun show
in Dallas last week

07:37.591 --> 07:39.024
- I'll believe it when I see it.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.193
Besides how hard is it
to find the key anyway?

07:41.195 --> 07:43.895
I know exactly where
my dad hides his.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.864
- Well I think my mom hid it.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.599
- Doesn't make it tougher.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.967
Probably in their room.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.970
- Come on get a
wiggle on ladies.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.538
- Or in the kitchen.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.706
- The kitchen.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.941
- We're talking today about how

07:55.943 --> 07:58.510
to keep the romance
alive in your marriage.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.744
- Have an affair.

07:59.746 --> 08:00.946
- Maybe we should
turn the TV off.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.548
- Let's just wait
for the commercial.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.016
- To pick up the
kids from soccer practice,

08:05.018 --> 08:07.619
why not make
appointments for romance.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.988
- Great more crap we gotta do.

08:11.057 --> 08:11.823
- You must not
like it very much?

08:11.825 --> 08:12.991
- Like what?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.626
- Sex.

08:14.628 --> 08:18.864
- Honestly I'd rather just
have a banana boat from the DQ.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.968
- I used to love getting
the high hard one.

08:22.970 --> 08:23.970
- Mother.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.172
- Oh stop being such
a prude, Shirley.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.574
You could probably use a
little action yourself.

08:29.576 --> 08:31.977
- I do just fine
thank you very much.

08:31.979 --> 08:32.910
- Oh yeah,

08:32.913 --> 08:34.546
how often do you and bill do it?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.847
- Not that it's any of
your business mother

08:36.850 --> 08:40.018
but since we're airing
our dirty laundry,

08:40.020 --> 08:44.222
I'd say at least once a
month or every three weeks.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.590
- That sucks.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.995
- It's not the quantity,
it's the quality.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.030
- I'm sure that sucks too.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.799
You should be a
shamed of yourself.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.002
I don't think a day
went by for 50 years

08:57.004 --> 08:58.270
that your father and I,

08:58.272 --> 09:00.038
god rest his soul,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.908
didn't fuck each other silly.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.844
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.046
- Okay Jenna it's your turn.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.681
Fess up how often you and Glenn

09:09.683 --> 09:10.582
have sex?

09:10.584 --> 09:14.686
- I thought we were going to
discuss sense and sensibility.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.087
And anyway Glenn's
going to be home soon,

09:16.089 --> 09:17.989
I gotta get supper started.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.958
- Oh it's that bad huh?

09:22.595 --> 09:24.329
- A couple times a week.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.764
- Respectable.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.999
- But.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.668
Do you like it.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.735
- Well yeah.

09:31.938 --> 09:34.739
- Good lord that's a
ringing endorsement.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.809
- No I wish it was
more spontaneous.

09:38.978 --> 09:41.646
You know the way it used to be.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.249
- How about we start a website,

09:44.251 --> 09:46.084
anisochromatic

09:46.086 --> 09:47.886
I bet we'd make a fortune.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.054
- You'd make a lot more with

09:49.056 --> 09:50.188
bombastically

09:57.063 --> 09:58.296
- oh wow yeah.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.339
- Lance asleep?
- Ah-huh.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.773
- And Sandy.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.642
- She's on the phone with Kieth.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.910
I really don't
think it's healthy

10:11.912 --> 10:14.045
for her to be spending
so much time with him.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.614
- Oh they're teenagers,

10:15.616 --> 10:17.248
that's what it was all about,

10:17.250 --> 10:18.984
remember.

10:18.986 --> 10:19.985
- I'm dreading her coming
to us saying she's moving

10:19.987 --> 10:22.053
to San Antonio with Kieth,

10:22.055 --> 10:23.755
instead of going to college.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.923
- She's a smart kid.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.059
She'll make the right decisions

10:28.061 --> 10:29.127
- well I just don't want
her to look back later

10:29.129 --> 10:30.129
and have regret.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.368
- Hey you know what I heard
through the grapevine today?

10:36.370 --> 10:37.736
- What?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.971
- They're gonna make me a VP.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.173
- Oh honey that's great.

10:42.175 --> 10:46.411
- And I was thinking that
we can you know celebrate.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.083
- Did you now?

10:56.088 --> 10:58.156
I saw this expert
on TV talking about

10:58.158 --> 11:01.993
keeping the passion
alive in your marriage,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.795
he was suggesting an exercise.

11:03.797 --> 11:07.265
Where we just keep
touching each other.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.900
- And then?

11:08.902 --> 11:11.302
- And then we get all
excited wanting each other.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.071
- And.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.939
- And then nothing.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.677
- Nothing.

11:18.679 --> 11:19.679
- Right.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.147
- Then what's the point?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.149
- Just for something different.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.750
- What's wrong
with what we have?

11:25.752 --> 11:27.185
- Nothing's wrong
with what we have.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.888
I just thought we could
mix things up a bit.

11:29.890 --> 11:30.822
- Look if you're
not in the mood,

11:30.824 --> 11:32.057
just say you're not in the mood.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.092
- No I am in the mood.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.062
I thought it might be fun.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.163
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.099
- Sure.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.200
- Okay.

12:21.774 --> 12:24.409
Okay stop, you
know I'm ticklish.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.144
- Hey if I have to endure
the torture of this exercise,

12:26.146 --> 12:27.412
so do you.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.148
- Stop, stop lets just have sex.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.229
- Whoa.
- Told you.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.231
A Mauser c96.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.933
- Holy shit is it loaded?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.135
- No.
- Let me see it.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.202
- Whoa dude what are you doing?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.470
You'll get us busted.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.263
- Jesus.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.298
They killed Otis.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.540
- Well luckily it's
just a flesh wound.

13:28.542 --> 13:32.010
Otis must have passed out
when he saw all that blood.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.146
I guess the buttocks is the
meatiest part of the body,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.881
but the real issue here is,

13:36.883 --> 13:39.284
this could have been
much, much worse.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.552
- Are you listening Lance,

13:40.554 --> 13:43.221
you could have killed someone.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.355
- Yes ma'am.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.490
- All right then,

13:45.492 --> 13:48.159
as long as we
understand each other.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.296
- Thanks sheriff.
- Thanks sheriff.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.298
- Thanks bill.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.400
- I'm going to have to
suspend him for a while folks.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.835
- We understand.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.137
- Lance what on earth
were you thinking?

13:59.139 --> 14:01.139
- I just wanted to
show Timmy the gun.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.575
- Well you know we can't have
something like that in school,

14:03.577 --> 14:07.378
especially will all
these shootings nowadays.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.216
It is a beauty though.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.218
- Yeah.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.423
- Whee that grip is sweet.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.927
Walnut?

14:22.929 --> 14:23.929
- Rosewood.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.266
- Bet that put you
back a few peso's huh?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.868
- Oh just a few.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.576
- Well again we can't
have 'em in school.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.311
- We understand.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.911
- You young man aught to know
better than to take a fire arm

14:41.913 --> 14:43.514
anywhere without checking
the chamber first.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.184
- I tell him that
a thousand times.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.186
- Kids.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.122
We all good?
- Thanks Eric.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.330
- Doctor said you should be
out of here in about a day

14:59.332 --> 15:01.366
or two at the most.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.668
- I told you that
intersection was dangerous.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.602
- You were shot dad,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.037
you weren't hit by a bus.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.138
- This time.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.239
- Hey Barb.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.375
Hey Otis, hey Stan.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.043
- Sorry Mrs Archer.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.480
- How you feeling there big guy?

15:15.482 --> 15:17.282
- I'd be a lot better
if someone brought me my

15:17.284 --> 15:18.483
cheery jello.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.318
- Good lord he's fine.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.253
- I'm so sorry about this.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.488
Lance is not allowed
out of the house

15:23.490 --> 15:25.256
until he graduates.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.159
- I'm just glad he's
not a better shot.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.461
- Got your ass pretty good.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.999
- He just wants to
be like you Glenn.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.467
How would you have felt
if Timmy were over here

15:36.469 --> 15:39.337
and Lance accidentally shot
him with one of your guns?

15:39.339 --> 15:41.205
Or shot himself.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.074
- I would have felt terrible.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.044
- But it's not going to happen.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.378
- But it could.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.350
I wanna get rid
of the guns Glenn.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.220
Everyone keeps saying how
somebody aught to do something

15:56.222 --> 15:57.722
about all those
shootings out there.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.191
Well you know what,
every avalanche

16:00.193 --> 16:01.659
starts with a single snow flake.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.395
Maybe, maybe I'm that snowflake.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.367
- You're just a plain flake

16:09.369 --> 16:12.370
if you think I'm
giving up my guns.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.107
Hunting with the boys
is my only outlet.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.409
- Killing defenseless
animals is your only outlet.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.045
- I don't get a great book club.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.381
- What kind of an
analogy is that?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.750
- First one that came to mind.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.122
- Then how about you just
get rid of your hand guns?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.358
- I love my hand guns.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.592
Hey no come on.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.462
Hun, honey no need
to fight about this.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.198
It has been a rough day.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.267
I will talk to Lance
again tomorrow.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.677
- Lance.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.733
- Well what did you expect?

17:15.734 --> 17:16.701
- I don't know,

17:16.703 --> 17:19.537
be listened to for one.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.406
- Asking men in Rockford
to give up his gun

17:21.407 --> 17:25.643
is like asking him to
cut of his.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.244
- Oh hey Wally.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.445
- Hey Jenna.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.181
Oh I heard about
Lance shooting Otis,

17:30.183 --> 17:31.549
nasty business.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.650
- You know I needed
to ask you a question,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.419
as the mayor.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.455
- Oh wait let me put
on my mayors hat.

17:41.493 --> 17:42.593
Excuse me.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.230
- I was wondering about
maybe getting rid of

17:46.232 --> 17:48.366
some of the guns in town.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.503
- What do you mean?

17:52.505 --> 17:53.503
- Well I don't know really.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.740
I was hoping you being
the mayor and all,

17:55.742 --> 17:58.176
you might have some ideas.

18:00.479 --> 18:04.315
- Well one idea might
be to lock up your guns,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.384
so your kids can't get to 'em.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.486
- Well what if people
forget to lock 'em up,

18:08.488 --> 18:10.388
or what if the
kid finds the key.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.622
Like mine did.

18:13.592 --> 18:17.628
- Well we can't plan for
every eventuality can we?

18:19.798 --> 18:21.732
Anything else?

18:21.734 --> 18:22.734
- No.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.804
- 10's or 20's?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.606
- 20's are fine.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.608
- Okay.

18:32.644 --> 18:33.644
I gotta go.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.747
I have to get some.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.349
I'll call you okay.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.351
Bye.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.337
- Hey Jenna.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.404
- Hey Byron.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.449
- Missed a spot.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.583
- So did you.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.152
In your underwear.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.154
- Weed.

19:16.156 --> 19:16.854
- Quit it bitch.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.722
- To you'll what?

19:17.724 --> 19:18.724
Shoot me.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.473
- Yeah I know.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.375
Yeah I have it right here.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.477
- Answer the phone.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.279
- But I'm talking,

19:41.281 --> 19:43.447
just hold on a second.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.449
- Chop, chop.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.387
- Piece of shit.

19:56.495 --> 19:57.962
Damn piece of shit.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.903
Pretty cool car huh.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.644
- I really don't understand
why you're getting

20:13.646 --> 20:15.680
so bent out of shape
about all this.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.981
- You know I don't
ask you for much,

20:16.983 --> 20:19.417
but I am asking you now.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.419
- I'm sorry hon,

20:21.421 --> 20:23.554
can't we just agree to disagree.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.655
- No.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.492
- All right I'll make you a deal

20:28.494 --> 20:31.295
you get everyone in town
to give up their guns

20:31.297 --> 20:32.563
I will too.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.664
- You know that's
not gonna happen.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.000
- Then why should
it happen for me.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.869
- Fine, but if you
won't do things for me,

20:38.871 --> 20:40.738
I'm not gonna do things for you.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.740
- Fine.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.910
Like what?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.546
- Like cooking for you.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.515
- I didn't starve to death
before we were married,

20:51.517 --> 20:53.784
I can fend for myself darling.

20:53.786 --> 20:58.656
- Well I hope you can do
other things by yourself too.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.924
- Meaning?

20:59.926 --> 21:00.926
- Meaning,

21:02.327 --> 21:06.697
I'm not gonna have sex
with you until you do this.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.566
- Really?
- Really.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.703
- I'm not gonna be forced
into doing something

21:12.705 --> 21:14.505
that I don't wanna do.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.673
And if you don't wanna have sex,

21:15.675 --> 21:17.508
suit yourself.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.045
I can go just as long
as you can without it.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.318
- Guns or pussy, sort of poetic.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.853
- Mother must you be so prude?

21:28.855 --> 21:29.855
- Well.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.924
- You got guts girl,

21:33.926 --> 21:35.326
I'll give you that.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.828
But Jen honey I hope
you didn't do it for me.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.030
- I know that Barb,

21:39.032 --> 21:40.731
the truth is I
did it for my kids

21:40.733 --> 21:42.366
and everyone else's kids.

21:42.368 --> 21:45.536
I don't want anyone
else to get hurt.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.473
You could join me.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.743
- Join you how?

21:52.745 --> 21:53.644
- Like in a protest.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.779
No not a protest,

21:54.781 --> 21:55.880
like a crusade.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.017
You all could join me.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.019
- What kind of crusade?

22:02.021 --> 22:05.523
- To rid Rockford of
every gun in town.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.794
- I'm sorry but she's crazy.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.396
- What exactly do
you have in mind?

22:12.398 --> 22:14.732
- We get every woman
in town to agree

22:14.734 --> 22:16.400
not to sleep with any man,

22:16.402 --> 22:18.536
until they get
rid of their guns.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.837
- I don't know sugar,

22:19.839 --> 22:22.807
I like having my gun
around for protection.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.476
I mean you don't expect
your house to catch on fire,

22:25.478 --> 22:27.945
but you still have
a smoke detector.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.380
- Come on Shirley,

22:29.382 --> 22:30.648
when was the last time
anyone in this town

22:30.650 --> 22:31.648
needed a gun?

22:31.650 --> 22:33.417
- Yeah but honey, it
just ain't about need,

22:33.419 --> 22:34.785
I like my guns.

22:34.787 --> 22:35.853
- So does everyone else,

22:35.855 --> 22:38.889
but they're just too dangerous.

22:38.891 --> 22:42.126
- I'm trying to
have a baby Jenna.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.762
- Connie this is for your baby.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.699
- Yeah but even
if we all agreed,

22:48.701 --> 22:51.001
I mean how are we going to
get everyone else on board?

22:51.003 --> 22:52.837
I know a lot of
women in this town

22:52.839 --> 22:54.739
that won't go along with this.

22:54.741 --> 22:59.777
- We'll just have to try
to change their minds too.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.913
- Well I do love me
my Smith and Wesson

23:02.915 --> 23:05.649
but if getting rid of them
means I don't have to have sex

23:05.651 --> 23:08.018
with Stan anymore, sign me up.

23:10.756 --> 23:13.691
But how would we, you know,

23:13.693 --> 23:15.593
monitor the situation?

23:16.561 --> 23:17.960
- We help each other.

23:17.962 --> 23:20.831
Every woman in town becomes
part of a support system.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.100
- When you say no sex,

23:23.102 --> 23:25.936
what do you mean exactly?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.606
- What are you Bill Clinton?

23:28.608 --> 23:32.910
- She's right we've got to be
specific about these matters.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.044
I'd say no BJs.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.047
Or ass fucking either.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.849
- Oh how.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.618
- What about cuddling?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.019
- Cuddling, oh please

23:42.021 --> 23:44.455
men don't give a rats
ass about cuddling.

23:44.457 --> 23:48.659
That's just paying the toll
to get into the tunnel.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.094
- I don't see how the five of us

23:50.096 --> 23:52.430
are going to make a difference.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.733
- Well every avalanche starts
with a single snowflake.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.635
- I always loved that saying.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.570
- Well now we have a chance
to make it mean something.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.971
What do you say?

24:02.874 --> 24:03.941
You with me?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.210
- Well I already told you,

24:06.212 --> 24:07.812
I'm in.

24:07.814 --> 24:08.814
- I'm in.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.482
- Shirley?

24:11.484 --> 24:13.951
- Sheriff bill will have a cow.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.490
- What the hey, I'm in.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.492
- Yes.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.927
- The truth is,

24:22.929 --> 24:24.929
even if I say I would do it,

24:24.931 --> 24:26.931
I don't know if I can.

24:26.933 --> 24:27.933
- Why not?

24:29.968 --> 24:32.670
- Because I love sex, damn it.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.971
I really love it.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.242
Because of the baby too.

24:38.244 --> 24:42.680
- I think I have the answer
to your dilemma, honey.

24:43.949 --> 24:44.782
- That's it.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.484
No I'm leaving.

24:46.486 --> 24:49.854
- Good lord I always thought
that thing was a candle stick.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.555
- Throbzilla.

24:51.557 --> 24:54.792
I defy any man to keep
up with this puppy.

24:54.794 --> 24:58.996
Call 800 number by 5 pm if
you want over night delivery.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.033
- May I?

25:12.611 --> 25:14.745
Maybe I'll give it a whirl.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.081
- Yeah that and a nickname.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.820
- Glenn, what the
hell did you do?

25:22.822 --> 25:23.954
- I stood up for my rights.

25:23.956 --> 25:24.956
Our rights.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.826
- Well we're in a heap
of shit right now,

25:28.828 --> 25:31.795
bill told me that Shirley won't
go to bed with him neither.

25:31.797 --> 25:32.963
This this is spreading Glenn,

25:32.965 --> 25:34.999
it's like a god damn plague.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.234
- I'm still getting laid.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.703
- That's because you're single.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.939
- Maybe that's what
y'all got to do.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.908
Dump your wives.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.976
- It's not that simple Dex.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.878
Look I'm sure in a few
days this whole thing's

25:47.880 --> 25:50.281
just gonna blow over.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.049
- All right I wish
they'd fix something else

25:52.051 --> 25:53.884
to stop doing.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.019
Like talking.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.022
- You know what screw 'em.

25:58.024 --> 26:00.024
Let's go to the gun
show this weekend.

26:00.026 --> 26:00.991
- Which one?

26:00.993 --> 26:02.159
- Cabrito, we can get ribs

26:02.161 --> 26:03.961
on the way up there.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.663
- Cabrito it is.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.297
All right?

26:06.299 --> 26:07.565
- All right.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.040
- all right Sandy let's go.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.142
- Jen?
- Oh hi Cherise.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.747
- I just want you
to know that I'm in.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.049
- Glad to have you on board.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.283
- You bet ya.
- You go girl.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.751
- Hold up Jenna.

26:27.753 --> 26:28.751
- Oh hi Gladys.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.021
- I don't know if this idea has
a shot in hell of succeeding

26:31.023 --> 26:33.924
but I sure do fire
you for trying.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.593
- But are you in?

26:37.128 --> 26:38.195
- Oh I'm in.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.166
- There she is,

26:42.168 --> 26:43.100
she's a trouble
maker right there.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.169
- Mom what is going on here?

26:45.171 --> 26:46.171
Mom.

26:59.217 --> 27:00.651
- hey.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.119
- Hey.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.687
- How long you grounded for?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.689
- A month, how about you?

27:05.691 --> 27:06.757
- Six weeks.

27:07.993 --> 27:09.893
- First day out the house.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.328
- Tell me about it.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.798
My eyes are still
adjusting to the daylight.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.066
Well see ya.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.101
- Yeah see ya.

27:27.913 --> 27:28.812
- Sandy.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.812
- All day I've had to listen
to kids tease me about you.

27:31.814 --> 27:34.918
Do you have any idea how
ridiculous you look to people?

27:34.920 --> 27:37.121
I have never been so
humiliated in my life.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.822
- Well you're only 17,

27:38.824 --> 27:40.724
you've got a lifetime of
humiliation ahead of you.

27:40.726 --> 27:41.992
- Oh sure go ahead, make jokes.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.128
But you're only
embarrassing yourself

27:44.130 --> 27:45.963
and the rest of the family.

27:45.965 --> 27:49.299
Why can't you just get
a job or something?

27:49.301 --> 27:51.101
- I have a job.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.101
I'm raising you.

27:53.103 --> 27:56.707
- Well in case you haven't noticed
I'm not a child any more.

27:56.709 --> 27:59.276
- You're right I
haven't noticed.

28:01.746 --> 28:05.215
- Not so easy taking
a stand is it dad?

28:05.217 --> 28:06.217
- No.

28:08.019 --> 28:11.321
- Sorry about all this mess dad.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.158
I should have never taken
the gun in the first place.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.426
- I know.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.161
That was super dumb.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.198
But this is bigger
than the gun now.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.068
This is about the
battle of the sexes.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.303
And we have to win this one.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.172
Or the balance of
power could shift,

28:28.174 --> 28:31.375
the fabric of our society
will be destroyed.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.911
Like the fall of
the Roman empire.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.245
Or the Dallas cowboys.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.014
Do you understand?

28:39.317 --> 28:40.451
- Not really.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.755
- You will son,

28:44.757 --> 28:47.157
believe me one day you will.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.119
Did you just moan?

29:15.121 --> 29:16.453
- Excuse me?

29:16.455 --> 29:18.222
- You did that on purpose.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.523
- Did what?

29:19.525 --> 29:22.426
- You totally did
that on purpose.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.331
- Jackass.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.041
- Oh wait let me see it again.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.841
- Gorgeous right?

29:39.843 --> 29:42.479
It better be for what I
paid for that bad boy.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.315
- Glenn, great idea.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.484
- You are welcome.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.987
- Italian dressing.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.555
- Is it low fat?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.490
- Mhmm, those ribs
didn't stand a chance.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.827
And it looks you got
some for later too.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.162
- Uh huh thank you.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.230
- Is there anything
else I can get you sir?

30:00.232 --> 30:02.232
- Yeah actually can
you get me some Stevia

30:02.234 --> 30:03.133
for my lemonade.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.301
- I'll check.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.303
- What?

30:07.572 --> 30:10.107
Why do you think they
call tomato a fruit?

30:10.109 --> 30:14.244
I mean I understand
apples, oranges, raisins.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.313
But tomato's not even sweet.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.815
I mean how do they
get away with that?

30:17.817 --> 30:19.016
- That's a good question.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.017
- I think it might have
something to do with

30:20.019 --> 30:21.585
them having seeds.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.220
- So cucumber's a fruit?

30:23.222 --> 30:24.454
- I believe so.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.456
- That doesn't seem right.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.925
- Y'all work at a fruit plant,

30:27.927 --> 30:31.195
how do you not know this shit?

30:31.197 --> 30:33.897
- The point is that we're
all having a good time

30:33.899 --> 30:35.232
without our women.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.400
Am I right?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.307
- How about an avocado?

30:52.350 --> 30:55.352
- Jenna Keely has
something to say.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.354
- Thanks.

30:58.489 --> 31:00.257
Look we all pretty
much know each other

31:00.259 --> 31:01.425
in this town,

31:02.260 --> 31:04.194
we feel safe here.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.263
We feel like bad things only
happen out there somewhere else

31:06.265 --> 31:07.865
to other people.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.569
My son Lance did a
really careless thing

31:12.571 --> 31:15.472
that could have had
tragic consequences.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.374
Now I know many of
you love your guns,

31:17.376 --> 31:19.509
but it's time to decide.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.478
Which do you love more,

31:22.513 --> 31:24.882
your guns or your family?

31:26.351 --> 31:28.185
- Family.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.519
- I don't see how
getting rid of our guns

31:29.521 --> 31:30.521
is going to do anything.

31:33.359 --> 31:36.393
- Did you know that in the
18 months that followed the

31:36.395 --> 31:38.495
Newtown Connecticut
massacre there were

31:38.497 --> 31:40.631
74 more school shootings.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.300
- This isn't a gun issue.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.668
It's a mental illness issue.

31:44.670 --> 31:45.669
- That's right.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.070
- Really Byron.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.038
You think America's
got the market

31:48.040 --> 31:49.940
cornered on mental illness?

31:49.942 --> 31:51.275
What about all those other
places that don't have

31:51.277 --> 31:52.175
these mass shootings?

31:52.177 --> 31:53.610
Do you think they've
got less crazy people?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.345
They have less guns.

31:56.347 --> 31:57.614
- Anyway you slice it,

31:57.616 --> 32:01.385
this is a darn fool thing
you girls are doing.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.154
And Barb Archer you
get on back home

32:04.156 --> 32:05.322
where you belong.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.591
- Okay y'all know where
my daddy was shot,

32:07.593 --> 32:11.495
so obviously he's
been brain damaged.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.498
We're not here to
debate gun use.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.100
We are here to eliminate it.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.140
- Ladies, ladies.

32:24.142 --> 32:25.509
We need your help.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.679
Join us.

32:28.681 --> 32:30.580
We have the power.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.116
You have the power.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.422
There isn't anything in
this whole wide world

32:38.424 --> 32:40.257
more powerful than pussy.

32:40.259 --> 32:43.126
- That's going to have
to be it for today.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.728
- Oh I'm not finished bill.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.430
- Well I'm afraid you are.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.165
Because ladies this is
an unlawful assembly

32:48.167 --> 32:49.466
on public ground.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.001
- All right everybody let's go.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.336
- Bill parson,

32:52.338 --> 32:54.438
you let my mother
finish her piece.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.175
Or so help me god not only
won't I have sex with you

32:58.177 --> 33:00.243
but I'll never
speak to you again.

33:04.449 --> 33:07.551
- That's a little
embarrassing honey.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.386
All right I guess
another couple of minutes

33:09.388 --> 33:11.021
won't hurt anybody.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.124
- We're not giving
up our guns Wally.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.193
- Well I'm not
suggesting that Glenn.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.395
- Well what are we
supposed to do then?

33:18.397 --> 33:21.198
- Well why don't we beat
'em at their own game?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.566
I mean we can go
without having sex

33:22.568 --> 33:24.301
for as long as they can,

33:24.303 --> 33:25.303
can't we?

33:30.375 --> 33:32.442
Well I for one honestly
don't understand

33:32.444 --> 33:35.479
why y'all can't
control your women.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.114
- Well of course we
can control our women,

33:37.116 --> 33:39.282
but who needs all
this aggravation?

33:39.284 --> 33:40.484
Besides who wants to grovel

33:40.486 --> 33:42.419
every time you wanna have sex?

33:42.421 --> 33:43.587
- Like that don't happen now.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.422
- Shut up Dex.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.457
- Well what do
you want me to do?

33:47.459 --> 33:49.292
- How about we ban
'em from protesting?

33:49.294 --> 33:50.794
- That's a good idea.

33:50.796 --> 33:55.465
- Well I'm no lawyer but I'm
pretty sure we can't, Stan?

33:55.467 --> 33:59.636
- They have a constitutional
right to assemble.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.405
- Well I doubt our
founding fathers

34:01.407 --> 34:03.373
had this no sex thing
in mind when they wrote

34:03.375 --> 34:05.042
that stupid crap.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.578
- Can't we just get a
judge to make them perform

34:08.580 --> 34:09.813
their wifely duties?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.648
- No judge is going to
force a wife to have sex

34:11.650 --> 34:13.050
with her husband.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.453
- Especially when
they see his ugly ass.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.687
- Hey what are you
doing here anyway?

34:17.688 --> 34:19.322
I thought you was getting laid.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.458
- Well it seems the
rivers have dried up boys,

34:21.460 --> 34:23.560
if you catch my drift.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.263
- Jesus.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.797
- Oh my god.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.634
- She ruined my AK.

34:32.536 --> 34:35.105
I can't ever use it again.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.174
- You could use it
in San Francisco.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.708
- This is no joke damn it.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.578
What the hell are we
going to do about this?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.447
- Well I suggest that
we all just go home

34:43.449 --> 34:45.514
and ride this thing out.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.485
They're gonna cave in.

34:48.487 --> 34:51.554
They're weaker than we are.

34:51.556 --> 34:52.556
Got it?

34:57.195 --> 34:59.496
- Man am I catching hell
about this no sex thing.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.764
- You are.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.466
- Yeah.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.867
Everyone's saying I better
hope the apple falls far

35:03.869 --> 35:04.868
from the tree.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.603
And shit like that.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.372
- That's what you're
worried about?

35:09.374 --> 35:11.241
That you might not
have sex with me.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.509
- No, I just think you
should try and talk

35:12.511 --> 35:14.511
your mom out of this.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.512
- Why?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.180
- 'Cause it's dumb.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.282
That's why.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.484
- You saying my mom's dumb?

35:20.486 --> 35:21.351
- No, no not her.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.686
Just this idea.

35:24.655 --> 35:28.558
No one's going to give
up their guns Sandy.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.228
- People said Columbus
was stupid, you know.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.364
That he was going to fall
off the face of the earth.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.900
- Your mom's not going to fall
off the face of the earth,

35:36.902 --> 35:39.503
she's just going to
fall on her face.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.639
- At least she's doing
something she believes in.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.576
Why is everybody so
threatened by that?

35:46.578 --> 35:48.712
- I'll talk to you later.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.884
- Hey, you okay?

35:53.886 --> 35:55.485
- Yeah fine just,

35:55.487 --> 35:58.288
I'm sick of
everybody razzing me.

36:00.491 --> 36:03.693
- I think what your
mom's doing is great.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.162
- You do?

36:05.164 --> 36:06.496
- Yeah I do.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.366
And you can tell her I said so.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.602
- All right everybody
family meeting.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.703
Jenna?

36:15.339 --> 36:16.806
You're all in here.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.944
You're really not going
to cook for me anymore?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.646
- You're hands aren't broken.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.581
At least I hope not.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.782
For your sake.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.417
- Very funny.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.485
- I don't get it.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.485
- Quiet.

36:29.487 --> 36:31.488
And you should be standing
by me as well young man.

36:31.490 --> 36:32.689
- I was standing by you,

36:32.691 --> 36:34.591
but then I got hungry.

36:36.294 --> 36:38.728
- All right, obviously
things are getting

36:38.730 --> 36:41.398
a little tense around town,

36:41.400 --> 36:44.501
not to mention a little
tense around here as well.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.804
What if I were willing
to give away my m16.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.706
Maybe even the Mauser.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.410
- No that's not
good enough Glenn.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.610
They all have to go,

36:54.612 --> 36:56.813
and there's no giving
them away to your friends.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.548
- When did you become
such a damn liberal?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.917
- Since when did you
become such a damn idiot?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.686
- Oh that's very nice.

37:02.688 --> 37:03.954
You think it's right to
call me an idiot in front

37:03.956 --> 37:05.388
of our kids.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.323
That's what you wanna
teach your daughter?

37:06.325 --> 37:07.423
How to belittle her husband?

37:07.425 --> 37:09.893
Lance make sure your wife
never calls you an idiot

37:09.895 --> 37:11.595
in front of your kids.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.331
- What if his kids aren't there?

37:16.334 --> 37:18.535
- Is this really worth destroying
your family over, Jenna?

37:18.537 --> 37:21.671
- Who do you think I'm
doing this for Glenn?

37:21.673 --> 37:23.807
- Maybe you've got
a point to prove.

37:23.809 --> 37:26.710
Maybe some crazy idea you got
from one of them talk shows.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.378
- Did it ever occur to
you that I might be able

37:28.380 --> 37:30.013
to come up with my own ideas?

37:30.015 --> 37:33.617
That I'm not just
an extension of you.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.719
- Is that what this is about?

37:35.721 --> 37:37.621
You resent me for
giving up work,

37:37.623 --> 37:39.990
or not going to law school?

37:39.992 --> 37:41.992
Go back to work if you want.

37:41.994 --> 37:46.329
Go to law school, just
stop acting so ridiculous.

37:56.741 --> 37:57.974
What?

37:57.976 --> 38:00.844
- You're behaving
like a neanderthal.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.319
What's wrong with you?

38:09.321 --> 38:12.656
- They're gonna get
divorced because of me.

38:12.658 --> 38:13.857
- Look you may be a moron,

38:13.859 --> 38:15.892
and you may have
screwed up royally.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.294
But if mom and dad
ever get divorced

38:17.296 --> 38:19.462
it won't be because of you.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.630
You're just a little pawn,

38:20.632 --> 38:22.565
totally insignificant.

38:22.567 --> 38:23.667
- You really think so?

38:23.669 --> 38:24.734
- I know so.

38:25.736 --> 38:26.870
- Thanks Sandy.

38:39.717 --> 38:41.851
- You don't like the Oreos?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.653
- Too fattening.

39:10.948 --> 39:15.518
- I don't know how they can
go so long without having sex.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.520
- I know.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.488
If I had a pussy

39:18.490 --> 39:20.490
I'd be sticking things
up it all day long.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.290
- Yeah,

39:21.292 --> 39:23.126
that'd be the only way
I'd get my daily allowance

39:23.128 --> 39:25.395
of fruits and vegetables.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.597
- Anyone wanna
bowl another game?

39:27.599 --> 39:30.467
- I didn't wanna
bowl the last game.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.371
- What's it past your bedtime?

39:34.373 --> 39:35.438
- Oh my god.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.107
- What?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.509
- Ah nothing.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.545
- Come on you don't
get to do that.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.848
Say oh my god and say nothing.

39:44.850 --> 39:45.815
What's it say?

39:45.817 --> 39:47.751
- It's a personal text.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.887
- Well come on we
won't say anything.

39:59.096 --> 40:00.697
- Baby I'm lying in
front of the mirror

40:00.699 --> 40:01.798
on my stomach,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.566
I'm so wet right now,

40:03.568 --> 40:04.868
I'm touching myself.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.870
- What?

40:07.171 --> 40:10.907
- I'm so wet right now,
I'm touching myself.

40:15.713 --> 40:19.082
I am picturing you
fucking me from behind.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.152
I can feel you inside of me

40:22.154 --> 40:23.953
and I'm all, o o o o,

40:28.893 --> 40:30.160
extra h, extra h,

40:31.429 --> 40:33.463
exclamation, exclamation,

40:33.465 --> 40:34.831
smiley face and I,

40:36.767 --> 40:38.501
is that a cat Emoji?

40:40.571 --> 40:41.905
- What?

40:41.907 --> 40:43.840
- I guess it means pussy.

40:46.911 --> 40:49.078
- Is that the new iPhone?

40:51.482 --> 40:52.715
What?

40:52.717 --> 40:54.651
It's just really big text.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.486
- Shut the fuck up, Dex.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.188
- Look she's just
messing with you.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.809
- What are you doing
out here so late?

41:19.811 --> 41:20.811
- Reading.

41:21.612 --> 41:22.612
Thinking.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.717
- I'm sorry.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.921
For giving you such a hard time.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.890
And for acting all...

41:33.892 --> 41:34.991
- Bitchy?

41:37.194 --> 41:38.962
- Yeah I guess so.

41:41.932 --> 41:44.167
- You're a good girl Sandy.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.636
You're smart, you're beautiful,

41:46.638 --> 41:48.004
you're a natural born leader.

41:48.006 --> 41:51.074
I see the way the other
kids look up to you.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.775
You can be anything you want,

41:52.777 --> 41:54.010
you know that.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.714
- Dad always says
I'm just like you.

41:57.716 --> 42:00.550
And he thanks god
for it everyday.

42:02.086 --> 42:05.588
- I just want
what's best for you.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.123
- I know you do mom.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.997
If I wanted to help
out with the cause,

42:13.999 --> 42:16.666
what would you want me to do?

42:18.035 --> 42:21.170
- Well basically the
same as the rest of us,

42:21.172 --> 42:23.540
I would want you to convince
all the girls at school

42:23.542 --> 42:26.876
not to fool around
with any of the boys

42:28.045 --> 42:30.647
until all the guns are gone.

42:33.217 --> 42:36.619
I know you and I haven't
talked much about sex Sandy,

42:36.621 --> 42:38.922
and I'm sure it's a conversation
that's way passed due,

42:38.924 --> 42:41.024
but if you and Kieth...

42:41.093 --> 42:41.992
- mom.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.991
- Well I was never able
to talk to my mother

42:44.993 --> 42:48.998
about these things and I want
you to be able to talk to me.

42:50.234 --> 42:53.970
- We agreed to wait until
our one year anniversary.

42:55.773 --> 42:57.006
- When's that?

43:00.110 --> 43:01.110
- Tomorrow.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.047
- Oh.

43:06.283 --> 43:07.283
- Yeah.

43:10.020 --> 43:13.089
- If he loves you
Sandy, he'll wait.

43:15.626 --> 43:17.627
- You can't be serious.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.863
I've waited a whole year.

43:20.865 --> 43:23.032
- So what's another week or two?

43:23.034 --> 43:24.100
- Rockford's not going
to give up their guns

43:24.102 --> 43:26.302
in a week or two Sandy.

43:26.304 --> 43:29.939
They'll probably never
give up their guns.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.275
- You could help you know.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.978
Try to talk people into it.

43:34.980 --> 43:38.881
- Listen I don't wanna
sound like a jerk Sandy but

43:38.883 --> 43:41.117
I may not be able to wait.

43:42.319 --> 43:44.020
- Fine, don't wait.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.755
Go find someone else.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.023
Maybe I will too.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.125
- Who?

43:50.394 --> 43:52.028
- I could hook up with any
guy I want to right now

43:52.030 --> 43:54.964
and he'd gladly wait for me.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.000
- You don't love me.

43:57.002 --> 43:58.868
- Stop being such a baby Kieth.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.136
Of course I do.

44:01.005 --> 44:03.206
And if you love me you'll wait.

44:03.208 --> 44:06.209
- And if you loved
me you wouldn't.

44:08.012 --> 44:10.780
- I can not believe you.

44:10.782 --> 44:11.848
Wait.

44:11.850 --> 44:12.682
Come on.

44:12.684 --> 44:13.684
Sandy.

44:18.690 --> 44:19.922
- All right
now come on everybody.

44:19.924 --> 44:21.891
- Aside from our
god given rights,

44:21.893 --> 44:23.426
it is also our
constitutional right

44:23.428 --> 44:25.161
for a person to bare arms.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.163
It's written right there
in the second amendment.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.165
- Where?

44:29.034 --> 44:29.933
- What?

44:29.934 --> 44:34.037
- Where in the second
amendment does it say that?

44:34.039 --> 44:35.405
I'll tell you where,

44:35.407 --> 44:37.140
it's no where.

44:37.142 --> 44:38.740
- She's absolutely right.

44:38.742 --> 44:41.711
- The second amendment only
talks about state militias,

44:41.713 --> 44:44.213
before the supreme court
fabricated it in 2008,

44:44.215 --> 44:46.716
there was no such thing
as an individuals right

44:46.718 --> 44:47.984
to bare arms.

44:47.986 --> 44:50.253
In anyway Byron this
isn't about your rights,

44:50.255 --> 44:52.288
it's about what is right.

44:52.290 --> 44:54.257
It's about keeping
our kids safe.

44:54.259 --> 44:57.360
- That's right.
- Yes it is.

44:57.362 --> 45:00.163
- Having my guns make the
kids a whole lot safer.

45:00.165 --> 45:02.932
- Now you can keep your
guns if you want to,

45:02.934 --> 45:06.202
you just can't make
love to us if you do.

45:08.172 --> 45:10.173
- All right hold on.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.709
Now the good book says love's

45:12.711 --> 45:14.343
not supposed to be conditional.

45:14.345 --> 45:15.345
- Amen.

45:19.783 --> 45:21.250
- Does it really say
that in the Bible?

45:21.252 --> 45:22.418
- No it's men are from Mars,

45:22.420 --> 45:24.187
women are from Venus.

45:24.189 --> 45:25.288
- That was great.

45:25.290 --> 45:26.122
- All right.

45:26.124 --> 45:27.223
Hold on.

45:27.225 --> 45:30.226
It looks like maybe you
ladies are just being

45:30.228 --> 45:31.728
a little over zealous.

45:31.730 --> 45:33.463
Why don't we let cool
heads prevail here?

45:33.465 --> 45:35.264
I think the compromised
solution here

45:35.266 --> 45:37.867
would be no assault weapons.

45:38.435 --> 45:40.002
- Wally that's, no.

45:41.306 --> 45:42.505
- All right hold on.

45:42.507 --> 45:44.974
- Hell no Wally
it's all or nothing.

45:44.976 --> 45:46.142
- There you see.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.077
- See you can't
even give an inch.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.178
- All right that's enough.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.113
Hold on.

45:50.115 --> 45:51.513
Hold on, you listen to me,

45:51.515 --> 45:53.816
I think I can safety say
that I speak for the majority

45:53.818 --> 45:56.219
of the men in this
town and quite frankly

45:56.221 --> 45:59.055
we don't appreciate being
held hostage like this.

46:03.227 --> 46:06.329
- Wally, I don't
have to remind you

46:06.331 --> 46:09.031
that elections
are in four weeks,

46:09.033 --> 46:11.200
more than half of the
registered voters in this town

46:11.202 --> 46:12.935
are women.

46:15.006 --> 46:16.906
That sounds more like it.

46:16.908 --> 46:20.910
Are you going to support
this gun initiative or not?

46:20.912 --> 46:25.081
- Shirley this initiative
is over reaching.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.549
And you've hastily written,

46:26.551 --> 46:27.984
I'm not...

46:27.986 --> 46:29.552
- you're all gonna
have to decide.

46:29.554 --> 46:33.990
How bad do you wanna play with
the little man in the boat?

46:35.325 --> 46:38.461
- Who's the little
man in the boat?

46:38.463 --> 46:39.962
Dang.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.831
- You gotta decide Wally.

46:41.833 --> 46:42.833
Yes or no.

46:55.012 --> 46:56.012
- No.

46:58.382 --> 47:02.852
- Then I hereby nominate
Jenna Keely for mayor.

47:02.854 --> 47:03.854
- Oh...

47:07.257 --> 47:10.827
No Shirley that's real nice
but I don't think that...

47:10.829 --> 47:12.061
- hang on a minute.

47:12.063 --> 47:14.564
All right now wait
just a minute here.

47:14.566 --> 47:16.299
Jenna's got a home to run

47:16.301 --> 47:19.302
and right now she's got
her hands full with that.

47:19.304 --> 47:21.904
- I accept the nomination.

47:25.309 --> 47:26.542
- Power Jenna.

47:33.083 --> 47:34.517
- Asshole.
- Oh yeah.

47:34.519 --> 47:35.952
- Look I just don't
understand why I can't sleep

47:35.954 --> 47:38.187
in the same room
with you anymore.

47:38.189 --> 47:41.123
- Because I don't trust myself.

47:41.125 --> 47:43.192
- Well doesn't that
tell you something?

47:43.194 --> 47:45.962
Don't you wanna try for?

47:45.964 --> 47:48.898
- Louis Alberto

47:48.900 --> 47:50.333
That is hitting below the belt.

47:50.335 --> 47:51.567
- So is this.

47:51.569 --> 47:54.270
- I thought you
didn't care about sex.

47:54.272 --> 47:58.341
- It's only an issue when
you're not having any.

48:00.544 --> 48:04.981
It's a little rude to be
brushing your teeth right now.

48:04.983 --> 48:05.983
Fuck.

48:07.651 --> 48:10.486
- My son Lance did
a really careless thing

48:10.488 --> 48:13.289
that could have had
tragic consequences.

48:13.291 --> 48:15.291
Now I know many of
you love your guns,

48:15.293 --> 48:17.360
but it's time to decide.

48:43.053 --> 48:45.154
- Hey folks we
have a blue light special

48:45.156 --> 48:49.392
on beer in the fridge section
so grab yourself a cold one.

48:53.363 --> 48:55.031
- Now I know many
of you love your guns,

48:55.033 --> 48:57.566
but it's time to decide
which you love more,

48:57.568 --> 49:00.002
you're guns or your family.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.108
Well thank y'all for
coming out tonight

49:06.110 --> 49:09.712
and thank you Harland for
offering up your room.

49:10.681 --> 49:12.281
- Happy to help, happy to help.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.651
Just make sure y'all
lock up when y'all leave.

49:15.653 --> 49:16.485
- Okay.

49:16.487 --> 49:18.421
Well welcome to wag.

49:18.423 --> 49:20.256
Women against guns.

49:23.193 --> 49:24.727
We're here tonight
to strategize.

49:24.729 --> 49:27.596
To figure out a way we
can win this battle,

49:27.598 --> 49:30.566
so I'd like to open it
up now for discussion.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.535
Anybody have any ideas?

49:33.603 --> 49:35.171
- Well it seems to me,

49:35.173 --> 49:37.306
we all know where the
men keep their guns.

49:37.308 --> 49:40.242
Why not just take them
while they're sleeping?

49:40.244 --> 49:42.545
- Well I think the idea
Gladys is to get them to

49:42.547 --> 49:44.580
do it voluntarily
otherwise they'll just

49:44.582 --> 49:46.182
go get new guns.

49:48.251 --> 49:51.520
- Maybe the thing to do is we
raise the stakes a little bit

49:51.522 --> 49:53.622
you know turn up the heat.

49:53.624 --> 49:54.624
- How?

49:56.026 --> 49:57.426
- Bam, bam, bam.

50:00.163 --> 50:02.331
- You want us all
to become lesbians?

50:02.333 --> 50:04.433
- No, make it
unbearable for them.

50:04.435 --> 50:08.604
You know sexting wasn't
working so we dress sexy.

50:10.340 --> 50:13.209
- Short skirts and cleavage.

50:13.211 --> 50:15.578
Show off those gams and titties.

50:15.580 --> 50:17.346
Like proper sluts.

50:18.782 --> 50:20.416
- And we start talking nasty,

50:20.418 --> 50:23.519
you know make 'em
want it real bad.

50:27.392 --> 50:30.393
- Geez Tina, Louise why didn't
I think about this before?

50:30.395 --> 50:32.061
- What, think off what?

50:32.063 --> 50:34.497
- Teresa darling you still
got that closing shift

50:34.499 --> 50:36.198
at the relax hall?

50:36.200 --> 50:37.500
- Ain't been fired yet.

50:37.502 --> 50:41.070
- Okay and y'all still
sell those boner pills?

50:41.072 --> 50:42.238
- We sure do.

50:43.440 --> 50:44.540
- Okay.

50:45.809 --> 50:47.243
Oh it's good.

50:47.245 --> 50:50.046
- More coffee bill?
- Yes please.

50:53.350 --> 50:55.384
Why are you so
cherry this morning?

50:55.386 --> 50:56.519
- Why not.

50:56.521 --> 50:57.820
- A town divided,

50:57.822 --> 50:59.321
not by nuclear power plants,

50:59.323 --> 51:02.224
toxic waste or economic crisis,

51:02.226 --> 51:06.095
but by politics, sexual
politics that is.

51:06.097 --> 51:08.431
The women of this small
town named after reclusive

51:08.433 --> 51:10.433
billionaire Cyrus Rockford,

51:10.435 --> 51:13.436
are waging a war against
their male counter parts.

51:13.438 --> 51:15.304
Rid Rockford of all guns

51:15.306 --> 51:16.306
or no sex.

51:17.407 --> 51:18.441
You heard right.

51:18.443 --> 51:20.109
- Howdy ma'am.

51:20.111 --> 51:23.479
I just wondered if you
could move your camera

51:23.481 --> 51:27.550
away from this store front
because the owner doesn't,

51:27.552 --> 51:29.518
the owner doesn't want,

51:36.493 --> 51:37.660
gee thanks.

51:42.866 --> 51:44.166
- Are you getting this?

51:44.168 --> 51:46.569
- That is kinda hard to miss.

51:46.571 --> 51:47.703
Pun intended.

52:01.818 --> 52:02.885
- Oh hi Dex.

52:03.787 --> 52:05.488
- Morning Connie.

52:08.592 --> 52:10.659
- What can I do for you?

52:12.529 --> 52:15.364
Would you like to
make a deposit?

52:20.170 --> 52:21.170
- Oh no.

52:27.744 --> 52:29.345
It's the shorts.

52:30.881 --> 52:31.881
Excuse me.

52:34.584 --> 52:36.318
- Bye Dexie.

53:19.463 --> 53:20.563
- no one's going
to pay attention

53:20.565 --> 53:22.665
to a bunch of
crazed house wives.

53:22.667 --> 53:25.401
- They're withholding
sex from their husbands.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.203
- We're gonna have to
send a support team.

53:27.205 --> 53:29.438
I want you to
spearhead this thing.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.438
I swear every time some
idiot shoots somebody

53:31.440 --> 53:33.609
in a school all the other
idiots have to go on about

53:33.611 --> 53:34.677
gun control.

53:35.779 --> 53:36.979
Do whatever you need to do,

53:36.981 --> 53:38.714
but just make this
thing go away.

53:38.716 --> 53:39.716
- Yes sir.

53:47.557 --> 53:49.458
- All right look everybody
in favor of going on strike

53:49.460 --> 53:50.659
raise your hand.

53:52.462 --> 53:53.596
- A strike?

53:53.598 --> 53:54.763
- Why not?

53:54.765 --> 53:55.798
It's not about the sex,

53:55.800 --> 53:57.533
it's about the principle.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.702
And I hate to say it guys but
they're a lot more organized

53:59.704 --> 54:01.003
than we are.

54:01.005 --> 54:02.671
- Well what are you
suggesting we do?

54:02.673 --> 54:05.674
- When Arlene asks
you to wash the car,

54:05.676 --> 54:07.409
you say can't do it.

54:08.979 --> 54:11.814
When Connie asks you to
fix the garbage disposal

54:11.816 --> 54:13.649
you say, can't do it.

54:13.651 --> 54:15.649
- No I can't do that anyway.

54:15.651 --> 54:18.621
- All right point is
whatever they ask us to do

54:18.623 --> 54:19.922
we can't do it.

54:21.725 --> 54:23.726
We have to hang tough.

54:23.728 --> 54:26.595
- I'm sick of jerking off.

54:26.597 --> 54:28.931
- Why don't we get
some blowup dolls?

54:28.933 --> 54:31.267
- I'm sick of airheads too.

54:31.269 --> 54:34.837
- All right what
about the strike guys?

54:34.839 --> 54:37.039
- All right look all those
in favor of going on a strike

54:37.041 --> 54:38.641
raise your hand.

54:40.410 --> 54:41.310
Opposed?

54:41.312 --> 54:46.415
Gentleman we are now
officially on strike.

54:46.417 --> 54:47.416
Hold on, hold on.

54:47.418 --> 54:48.484
Any other order of business?

54:48.486 --> 54:49.486
- Just one.

54:53.023 --> 54:56.492
Seems to me everybody
here's a bit frustrated

54:56.494 --> 54:57.960
and tense.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.628
- Who the hell are you?

54:59.630 --> 55:03.299
- Elias Jones from the
national gun organization.

55:03.301 --> 55:05.634
Dwayne Lafontein asked me
to come down here personally

55:05.636 --> 55:08.370
to see just how we
could be of help.

55:08.372 --> 55:10.739
- Send us some hookers.

55:10.741 --> 55:11.741
- How many?

55:14.010 --> 55:15.577
- Hey we're in church buddy.

55:15.579 --> 55:17.780
- Oh I think god'll understand.

55:17.782 --> 55:19.815
After all the way your
ladies are behaving

55:19.817 --> 55:21.717
that's awful unchristian like.

55:21.719 --> 55:22.985
- I've never paid for
sex in all my life

55:22.987 --> 55:24.620
and I'm not about to start.

55:24.622 --> 55:26.922
- We'll foot the bill.

55:26.924 --> 55:29.692
- A brunette with dd please.

55:29.694 --> 55:31.794
- Give me a break the
closest you ever got

55:31.796 --> 55:33.962
to a dd is in flashlight.

55:35.565 --> 55:36.799
- Fellas we want you to know

55:36.801 --> 55:39.401
you're not alone
in this struggle.

55:39.403 --> 55:40.669
Now if they're gonna tell you

55:40.671 --> 55:41.603
you can't have guns,

55:41.605 --> 55:42.438
what's next?

55:42.440 --> 55:43.539
Poker night?

55:43.541 --> 55:45.607
Football Sunday?

55:45.609 --> 55:47.810
Hell this is immoral fellas.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.713
- He's right.

55:50.715 --> 55:52.948
This here is a moral issue.

55:52.950 --> 55:54.783
Bring on the hookers.

55:55.852 --> 55:58.420
- Some of us are married.

55:58.422 --> 56:00.389
- Some of us aren't.

56:00.391 --> 56:02.691
- What about the law?

56:02.693 --> 56:03.959
- Well before I do anything

56:03.961 --> 56:05.728
I gotta see something first.

56:05.730 --> 56:08.597
Lately you know my eyes
haven't been too good.

56:08.599 --> 56:11.734
- It's probably all
the jerking off.

56:11.736 --> 56:14.770
- Boys I can't be
a part of this.

56:14.772 --> 56:17.072
- Yeah I can't either.

56:17.074 --> 56:19.575
Hell hath no fury
like a Latina scorned.

56:19.577 --> 56:21.043
- Fellas I'm not
suggesting you do anything

56:21.045 --> 56:22.845
you don't want to.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.480
Okay god knows I'm
not the one to judge,

56:24.482 --> 56:25.814
but I do know that what
your women are doing

56:25.816 --> 56:26.915
is wrong.

56:26.917 --> 56:29.885
And in like you have
to pay the consequences

56:29.887 --> 56:31.553
for your actions.

56:33.423 --> 56:35.124
This here's about freedom.

56:35.126 --> 56:39.561
And our forefathers really
fought hard for that freedom.

56:40.663 --> 56:43.766
And now the battle's
come to Rockford.

56:43.768 --> 56:45.834
So for those of you who
wanna stand up and fight

56:45.836 --> 56:47.903
for your freedom,

56:47.905 --> 56:50.072
there will be dozens of
beautiful ladies here

56:50.074 --> 56:52.775
tomorrow night at eight.

56:52.777 --> 56:54.576
God speed gentleman.

56:54.578 --> 56:56.845
Oh, oh and boys please remember

56:56.847 --> 56:58.814
it's our little secret.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.685
- Meeting adjourned.

57:08.124 --> 57:09.758
- Getting a bit
out of hand, huh.

57:09.760 --> 57:10.760
- A bit.

57:12.862 --> 57:15.130
But there's always
a silver lining.

57:15.132 --> 57:17.900
- What's the silver
lining with a sex rink?

57:17.902 --> 57:21.537
- Keeps you from sleeping
with my daughter.

57:32.816 --> 57:34.683
- Okay so I'm here.

57:35.852 --> 57:37.953
- I got you something.

57:39.722 --> 57:40.789
- Thank you.

57:43.059 --> 57:45.661
It's a striking resemblance.

57:46.896 --> 57:48.130
What's it for?

57:51.801 --> 57:53.869
- I wanted to apologize.

57:54.871 --> 57:57.105
I'm sorry ant what I said.

57:58.708 --> 57:59.708
You know about your mom

57:59.710 --> 58:02.077
and about not wanting to wait.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.180
I love you Sandy.

58:07.784 --> 58:09.518
I wanna be with you.

58:10.186 --> 58:12.154
No matter what that is.

58:13.857 --> 58:16.959
- I am so gonna make
it worth the wait.

58:24.901 --> 58:28.136
- Oh can I get one
of them red things?

58:31.708 --> 58:33.008
- A rose?

58:33.010 --> 58:34.910
- Yeah roses are good.

58:35.845 --> 58:37.112
- Hot date?

58:37.114 --> 58:38.180
- I hope so.

58:39.048 --> 58:41.517
- Well she must be real special.

58:41.519 --> 58:42.617
- Oh I'm sure she is.

58:42.619 --> 58:44.786
- It's nice to see people
still courting each other

58:44.788 --> 58:46.722
even though there's no,

58:46.724 --> 58:48.724
well you know.

58:48.726 --> 58:49.726
- Yeah.

58:50.193 --> 58:51.793
What's courting?

58:53.763 --> 58:56.632
- You know good
old fashion dating.

58:56.634 --> 58:57.634
- Oh yeah.

58:59.202 --> 59:00.869
Courting.

59:00.871 --> 59:03.238
- So what's her name?

59:03.240 --> 59:04.139
- Who?

59:04.141 --> 59:08.010
- The girl you're
buying the flowers for.

59:08.012 --> 59:10.012
- Oh, I have no idea.

59:11.948 --> 59:13.549
- Ah blind date.

59:14.751 --> 59:16.218
- In a sense yeah.

59:16.220 --> 59:20.622
But I'm not at Liberty
to discuss it though.

59:20.624 --> 59:22.190
- Discuss what?

59:22.192 --> 59:26.628
- Oh the two truck loads of
hookers coming in tonight.

59:39.909 --> 59:41.677
Did I say hookers?

59:42.579 --> 59:43.579
- Yeah.

59:44.914 --> 59:47.916
- Because I meant
something else.

59:53.957 --> 59:55.691
Thank you very much.

59:57.994 --> 59:59.928
You keep the change.

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:10.339
- Right here.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:18.046
Drivers license and
registration please.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:24.786
Can you remove it from
the plastic holder please?

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.693
Why so nervous, Gus?

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.796
- No reason.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.132
- Officer Archer?

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.132
- Sheriff.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:41.003
- Can you check out
the other truck?

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:42.070
- Copy that.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:48.343
- Would you mind stepping
out of the vehicle sir?

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:49.811
- Is something wrong?

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.881
- That's what we're
here to find out?

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.157
What brings you to Rockford Gus?

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.426
- Just delivering some goods.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.996
- That wouldn't be
contraband would it Gus?

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.699
- No ma'am just ordinary goods.

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:12.934
- At 8 pm on a Sunday Gus.

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.005
You been drinking Gus?

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:18.373
- No ma'am.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:22.177
- Put your arms out to
your side like this.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:26.081
Now touch the tip of
your nose with each hand.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.986
Put your right foot in.

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.324
Put your right foot out.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.327
Put your left foot in.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.765
Now shake it all about.

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:44.733
- Excuse me?

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.068
- You know the hokey pokey Gus?

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.969
- I'm afraid I don't.

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.205
- Let's look in the truck.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.275
Open her up.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:04.953
Cherries huh.

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:15.163
- What time you got?

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:18.233
- About five minutes after
the last time you asked me.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.533
- Must have got lost.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.270
- Yeah Rockford's
really hard to find.

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.308
- Where'd you tell
Barb you were going?

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:31.179
- I don't think she's much
interested in my where abouts.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:34.349
- Well I'm only
waiting one more hour.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:35.784
And that's it.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.127
- Mrs Parsons.

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:46.294
- Oh hi Owen.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.532
- What in blazes are you doing?

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:52.501
- Making a citizens arrest.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:55.103
- What you're not even cops.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.539
You better let us go right now.

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:59.441
- I'll handle this sir.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:04.212
Ladies I'm gonna need
all those uniforms back.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.380
It wasn't very nice
of you to take 'em,

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:07.015
what if there was some emergency

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.350
and I had to show
up on the scene

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.285
in nothing but my skivvies?

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.053
- I'm sorry about that Owen

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:15.924
but desperate times call
for desperate measures.

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:17.159
- That's true.

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:19.027
- We'll return them
to you straight away.

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:22.297
In the meantime they're
gonna spend the night here.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.366
Courtesy of the fine
citizens of Rockford.

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.134
- You can't keep us here.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.235
We have rights.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.437
- Tell it to the judge pimp.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.275
- Does your husband
know about this?

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.144
- We're not communicating
to great these days.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.280
But I'll be sure
and leave him a note

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.481
when I get home.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.584
- Where are the ladies?

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.987
- What ladies?

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.535
- Day 39 of the
Rockford sex strike

01:04:00.537 --> 01:04:03.605
was marked by
controversy as two men

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:06.842
allegedly hired by the
national gun organization

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:10.345
were arrested last night
for transporting prostitutes

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.380
into this sleepy little town.

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:14.249
- Son of a.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.284
- Sheriff William Parsons
has remained tight lipped

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:19.321
about the incident, refusing
to comment on the veracity

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:20.856
of the allegations.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:24.192
As we get set to enter
day 40 of the sex strike

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:27.362
both sides are digging
in their respective heels

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:29.297
and no one appears
to be yielding.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:31.366
- Why is this happening?

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.136
- I don't know what all
the ruckus is about,

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.305
I mean household
cleaning products

01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:40.141
can be just as dangerous
to a child as a gun.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:41.476
- Look terrorists
from around the world

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:44.145
can buy a 50 caliber
rifle at any gun show

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:45.914
across the country.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:46.916
That's crazy.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:49.484
- Well it's better they
by them guns from us

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.620
than out sourcing
them jobs to China.

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:53.054
Right?

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.322
Usa.

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:55.423
Usa.

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.058
- Shut up Dex.
- Usa.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.460
- Dick head.
- Usa.

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:01.129
- Like I need my gun
for self defense.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:04.099
- Is there a lot of
crime in Rockford?

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.333
- Oh hardly any,

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.335
but that's because
everybody has a gun.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.037
The only way to stop
a bad guy with a gun,

01:05:09.039 --> 01:05:10.305
is a good guy with a gun.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.373
- My son is 12 years old,

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.275
he's hardly a bad guy.

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:15.076
- Look guns don't kill people.

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:16.311
People kill people.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:17.445
- This is crazy,

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:20.415
now guns shoot
people by themselves?

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:27.555
Where did you get your top?

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:28.623
I really like it.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.158
- Well at the end of the day,

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.093
it's all about our Liberty.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.561
- Liberty?

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:36.464
They said the same crap
with the seatbelt laws,

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:38.133
and the smoking in public thing,

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.534
and now it's the guns.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:44.105
I gotta breath your secondhand
cancer for your freedom.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:48.410
A kid's gotta die in
school for your Liberty.

01:05:48.412 --> 01:05:50.612
Fuck them and their Liberty.

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:52.681
Punk ass mother fuckers.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:58.486
- All I know is this
strike is reeking havoc

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:00.455
on this community.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.290
You know this used to
be a nice place to live.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.326
- No everyone in town
shares Glenn Keely's

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:05.493
pessimistic view.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:07.595
Especially his wife Jenna Keely

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:09.364
who is now running for mayor.

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:12.267
- 40% of all guns
purchased in the us

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.636
are bought without
a background check

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.005
and gunshots are the
leading cause of death

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:18.540
among young people today.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.674
It's unforgivable.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:21.476
- You look really good mom.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:22.476
- Thanks honey.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.212
- This is
Patricia Valdez goodbye.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:26.348
- Is it true about the guns?

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.617
You know about it being the
main cause of death for kids?

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:31.386
- Afraid so Lance.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:37.559
- Glenn Keely please report

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:40.061
to Mr Rockford's office.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:43.531
Glenn Keely report to
Mr Rockford's office.

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:48.036
- Hi Gladys.

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:51.106
- Glenn Mr Rockford
will see you now.

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:15.430
- Have a seat.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:24.239
I find incense very calming.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.507
Don't you?

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:27.142
- Yes sir.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.343
It's very nice.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:30.245
- Got this batch in India.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:31.179
Ever been?

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.148
- No sir, can't say I have.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:34.148
- Too bad.

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.418
Although you probably saved
yourself from some vicious

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.452
fudgy squirks.

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:41.623
I'm there right now
with an ash shrine,

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:45.193
meaning of life's journey
and all that good crap.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:47.362
Anyway enough small talk,

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.231
I hear your wife's
stirred up quite a

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.734
hornets nest down there.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.469
- Yeah I guess that's true.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.438
- I'll get right to the point.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:00.075
Productivity is down
significantly this month,

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.277
people have had their
heads so far up their asses

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:05.080
I can hear them gasping for air.

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:08.516
How do you think
this is gonna end?

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:11.519
- I don't really
know Mr Rockford.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:12.919
- I do.

01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:15.557
It's gonna end with
people loosing their jobs.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:18.827
These are the cold,
hard facts Keely.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:21.095
I'm not going to keep
this factory open

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:23.398
just to dole out paychecks.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.500
Look at me.

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:29.604
You understand what I'm saying?

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:31.606
- I understand.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.174
- Good.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:48.590
- 101.

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.394
Can I get you anything else?

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.828
- No this is great.

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:58.832
Why are you being so nice?

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.770
- Easy to love someone
when you love 'em.

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:05.473
Loving someone
when you hate 'em,

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.509
that's the real deal.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.279
- I love you too you know.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:13.282
- I know.

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:17.185
I wish we could
end this craziness.

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.720
- I want nothing more.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:19.888
- Then do it.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.658
- I could say the same to you.

01:09:32.791 --> 01:09:34.470
- They're laying people off.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:39.640
- Yeah Cyrus isn't happy
with productivity dropping.

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:41.241
It's bound to happen,

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.578
I mean half the company's not
talking to the other half.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.513
- Better make myself scarce.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:46.581
- Good idea.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.220
- Hey Dax.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:54.288
Hey wait up.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.392
What happened?

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:59.327
- Old man Rockford fired me.

01:09:59.329 --> 01:10:00.329
- Ah shit.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.399
I'm sorry man, I didn't know.

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:05.900
He said that after this
strike thing is over

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:09.671
maybe he can hire some
people back, but...

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.740
He fired me on Skype.

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.644
That's kind of weird.

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:19.581
- Hey listen man
if you need help,

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.449
I got a little money saved.

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:22.784
- That's all right Glenn,

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:24.819
thank you though.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:25.821
Thank you.

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.259
Take care now.

01:10:31.261 --> 01:10:32.261
- Yeah.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.505
- Thanks so much
for your support,

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:46.241
we really appreciate
you coming out.

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.819
Since when do you smoke?

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.021
- After five weeks without sex,

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:02.924
I am lucky I am
not smoking crack.

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:05.760
I miss my man.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.428
I miss sharing my
feelings with him

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.265
while he stares at
me like a zombie.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.766
And that vibrator,

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.568
whatever that Throbzilla

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.404
doesn't have arms
to put around me.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:18.473
- You'll survive Connie.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.643
- It's not only that Jenna.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:22.644
I'm scared.

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:27.615
I'm scared with all these lay
offs that Louis might be next.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:31.286
I'm not sure this
whole thing's worth it.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.462
- I don't know if
anything will come of this

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:43.998
but give it your best shot.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.600
- Thanks Gladys.

01:11:51.607 --> 01:11:52.674
Mr Rockford?

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:59.547
I'm Jenna Keely.

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:01.482
Glenn's wife.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.621
If you're listening,

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:11.993
I'm pleading with you to
give people their jobs back.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.595
And not to fire anyone else.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.339
- We're going to offer these
girls 10 million dollars

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:26.708
to preserve freedom and
the American way of life.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:29.077
- 10 million dollars
is an awful lot.

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:31.813
How about we just give every
gun owner that stays the course

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:32.880
a free ak47?

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.417
- You think that's gonna fly

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:38.553
with these nampy pampy
politicians in Washington,

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:41.622
especially after
your hooker fiasco?

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:46.527
No, 10 million dollars is safer.

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:48.996
- You're the boss.

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.370
- Where are you going?

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:57.772
- Campaign meeting.

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.843
- You're pretty dressed up
to go to a campaign meeting,

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:03.443
don't you think.

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:05.813
- Well just think if you
weren't being so stubborn

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:08.983
maybe I'd be getting
this dressed up for you.

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:12.887
Or maybe I wouldn't be
getting dressed at all.

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.090
- Ha, ha very funny.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.759
Oh damn it Jenna.

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.968
How you doing sport?

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.703
- Okay.

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:30.905
- I was gonna grab some
pizza at,

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:32.874
do you wanna come?

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:34.542
- No thanks.

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.544
- You sure you're okay?

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.821
You can tell your dad, you know.

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.825
- I never meant to hurt anybody.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:52.059
- I know that.

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:57.465
- I wish I never picked
up that stupid gun.

01:13:57.467 --> 01:14:00.001
I wish I never
picked up any gun.

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.946
- I'll bring you
back a couple slices.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.014
Okay?
- Okay.

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.135
- You look great.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.137
- Oh thanks.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:38.806
- Would you like
something to drink?

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.608
- A glass of wine might be nice.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:41.943
- Red or white?

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:43.978
- You choose.

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:51.519
- I saw you sitting here.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:52.854
May I join you?

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.090
- Please.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.966
- How goes the battle?

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:06.067
- Still raging.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:11.706
- It is amazing to me
how depriving men of sex

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:13.841
can cripple a whole town.

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.944
- It can cripple
the whole world.

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:20.948
But then again so
can depriving women.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.583
- You think so?

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:23.651
- You don't?

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.724
- Tell me something,

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:32.159
if you had to do
it all over again

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:34.762
would you do the same thing?

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.836
- I'm not really sure.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.241
- I think a lot of women in
this town would say that's

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:49.210
a start Mr Keely.

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.879
- I suppose they would.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.180
And it's Glenn.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:58.119
- I'm just so tired of it all.

01:15:58.121 --> 01:16:00.054
I'm tired of
fighting with Glenn.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.256
Tired of dirty
looks from people.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.859
I'm tired of pretending
to be strong.

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:06.859
- You are strong.

01:16:06.861 --> 01:16:09.564
That's why you're
getting the dirty looks.

01:16:09.566 --> 01:16:11.899
- I guess we are giving them
a run for their money, huh.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.801
- 10 million buck from the ngo,

01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:14.769
you bet your ass.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:17.204
You are ruffling some feathers.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:20.341
More?

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.579
- I guess one more
couldn't hurt.

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:44.098
- It's a little late
don't you think?

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.969
- We had a lot to discuss.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:49.704
- I'll bet.

01:16:49.706 --> 01:16:51.706
- What's that suppose to mean?

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.374
- I called Connie and Barb.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:56.944
They didn't know anything
about a campaign meeting.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.013
- I expect this from Sandy,

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:01.215
not from her mother.

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:03.117
- And I expect this
from my father,

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.652
not my husband.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.724
- You been drinking?

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:13.227
- I had a glass of wine or two.

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:16.030
- Where were you?

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:18.099
- With Harlan.

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.402
He's my campaign advisor.

01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:24.872
- And he took all this
time to advise you?

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:26.974
- You're not jealous are ya?

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.342
- Jealous of what?

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.777
Some nerdy high school teacher

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.812
wants to get into
my wives pants.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.080
- Just because your
mind works that way

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:34.882
doesn't mean his does.

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:36.017
- Yeah right.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.186
- Did you kiss him?

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.791
- Did you kiss her?

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:47.762
- Who, the sleazy reporter
with the fake boobs.

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:50.831
- They're fake.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:55.069
- Please she could stand on her
head and they wouldn't move.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.104
Well did ya?

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:00.074
- No.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.076
Did you?

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:06.914
- No, but we did have
sex in the parking lot.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:26.300
- Are you sure nothing happened?

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:29.737
- There's something
I gotta tell you.

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:31.172
- Baby.

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:32.006
- No, no.
- What?

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:33.207
- Glen he's gay.

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.747
- You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:41.115
- No I promised
I'd keep it quiet,

01:18:41.117 --> 01:18:42.850
but I don't want you
wondering about this

01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:44.852
for the rest of your life.

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:45.854
- Oh man.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:49.290
That's the first gay
guy I've ever known.

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.725
- Not exactly.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.460
- Who else?

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.229
- His boyfriend.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.231
- Yeah.

01:18:57.966 --> 01:18:58.933
- No I can't say,

01:18:58.935 --> 01:18:59.933
just let it go.

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:02.236
- How could you keep
something like that from me?

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:05.806
- Okay promise you
won't say a word.

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:06.808
- Promise.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.210
- Byron.

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.212
- My Byron?

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:13.147
- I hope not.

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:15.950
- But he owns the gun shop.

01:19:15.952 --> 01:19:19.754
- Well think how tough
he's had it at home.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:20.756
- Oh man.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.824
Everything's all upside down

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:25.126
and inside out.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:42.309
I've never loved you as much
as I love you right now.

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:44.879
- Even after all this.

01:19:44.881 --> 01:19:48.015
- Especially after all this.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:49.017
- Why?

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.386
- You're doing something
you believe in.

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:55.790
No matter what
people think or say.

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:59.160
No matter what I
would think or say.

01:19:59.162 --> 01:20:02.029
I don't have the
guts to do that.

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:18.045
- we can't do this.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.848
- Yeah right.

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.176
- What's going on?

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.244
- What do you mean?

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.279
- With you and dad?

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:53.281
- Nothing.

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.291
- Mom.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.064
You didn't.

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:11.599
- Didn't what?

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:14.468
- Sandy why don't you
drive Lance to school.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:15.536
Take my car.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:18.873
- So what now you're just gonna
lay around the house all day

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:19.974
and not go to work?

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:21.575
- Sandy, take a hike.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.214
- I am very disappointed
in you mother.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.316
- We'll talk about it later.

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:33.053
- I don't understand
anything in this house.

01:21:39.528 --> 01:21:40.361
- All right.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.896
Hold on.

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.364
Come on now.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:44.365
Please settle down.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:46.500
Please settle down, ladies.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.936
Ladies the plain fact is
that if you continue on

01:21:48.938 --> 01:21:50.371
with this strike Rockford stands

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:53.040
to loose 10 million dollars.

01:21:57.946 --> 01:21:58.579
- Ladies please.

01:21:58.581 --> 01:21:59.647
Please ladies.

01:21:59.649 --> 01:22:01.315
Ladies, ladies.

01:22:01.317 --> 01:22:04.184
Think of how our town could
benefit from this money.

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:07.187
I mean new schools, new buses,

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:09.123
new community centers.

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:11.292
- That's Cyrus Rockford.

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:13.127
- Think of all the...

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.096
- Evening.

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:17.164
- Holy shit.

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:21.435
I'm gonna sit down.

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.406
- So 10 million
dollars to the town

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.609
and everything goes
back the way it was,

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.445
is that about it Mr Lafontein?

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:34.014
- That's about it Mr Rockford.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:38.419
- But something doesn't
seem quite right to me,

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:41.355
you come waltzing into our town,

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:46.193
waving all that money and
you act like you got a dog

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:47.428
in this fight.

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:49.630
- We all do.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:51.265
It's called Liberty.

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:52.433
- Amen.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.502
- No it's called lobbying.

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.440
You know what you are Dwayne?

01:22:59.442 --> 01:23:02.343
You're a walking,
talking, breathing gun.

01:23:02.345 --> 01:23:03.410
A hired gun.

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:07.414
You're job is to make sure
that the manufacturers

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:11.485
can make and sell as
many guns as possible.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:14.621
You're no different from
a corner drug dealer

01:23:14.623 --> 01:23:17.157
pushing crack for a cartel.

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:24.031
So I'm gonna offer this
town 10 million dollars

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:27.434
if the men of Rockford
will dispose of their guns.

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.474
- Now hold on, hold on.

01:23:33.476 --> 01:23:37.144
Mr Rockford we had always heard
that you are an avid hunter,

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:39.646
that no animal in Africa
was safe from you.

01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:45.686
- Yes I have done
my share of killing,

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:51.291
but now I don't believe in
harming any sentient being.

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:56.697
- Mr Rockford you are the
name sake of this town,

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:58.599
would you rather have it turned
into the peoples Republic

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:00.334
of New York City?

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:04.738
- Better that, than
a monastery full

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.241
of angry blue-balled monks.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:11.045
- Make it 11 million.

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:12.279
- There we go.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:16.650
- 11 it is.

01:24:19.755 --> 01:24:22.523
I feel like I'm on shark tank.

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.426
- 12.

01:24:25.428 --> 01:24:27.361
- Oh come on.
- Yeah.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.635
- No you are starting
to aggravate me son.

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:40.374
I am trying to reach.

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:54.488
Oh son of a bitch,

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:56.557
it's gonna take me 10
lifetimes to get there.

01:24:56.559 --> 01:25:00.260
Dwayne, I'm gonna see your
12 and raise you three.

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.196
That's 15 million dollars.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.666
What say you now?

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:07.734
- I have to make a phone call.

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:09.503
- Yeah, I'll wait.

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:31.592
- Wally.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:36.697
I would like to make
a statement if I may.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.534
For the first time
in a long time

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:43.337
I remember why my marriage was,

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.172
is so important to me

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:50.511
and while I'm honored
that so many of you

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:52.412
want me to run for mayor,

01:25:52.414 --> 01:25:56.216
I feel I can be more effective
continuing this fight

01:25:56.218 --> 01:25:58.652
without having to run Rockford.

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:03.757
Well the truth is I may not
be worthy of your trust.

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:09.296
Last night Glenn and I...

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:16.203
- Glock 22.

01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:18.472
- Jesus what the?

01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:20.574
- It feels good,

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:24.745
but you know what some how
it doesn't feel as good

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:26.180
as it used to.

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:31.485
And no where near
as good as my wife.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:34.555
And darling you wanna be mayor,

01:26:34.557 --> 01:26:36.823
hell you be mayor.

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.425
You got my vote.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:45.265
Mr Rockford.

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:49.503
That's just one gun,

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:50.771
but it's a start.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.476
And every avalanche starts
with a single snowflake.

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:57.478
Right baby?

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:03.717
I'll be at home destroying
the rest of them.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:04.952
See you later.

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:11.658
- Traitor.

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.761
- Wait a minute
where are you going?

01:27:14.763 --> 01:27:16.897
- I miss my wife Jake,

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:20.634
we were trying to make a baby
before all this craziness.

01:27:20.636 --> 01:27:22.703
I'd like to keep trying.

01:27:30.812 --> 01:27:34.581
- Wait a minute guys
where where you going?

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:37.017
Come on don't wimp out now.

01:27:37.019 --> 01:27:39.653
We're down to the home stretch.

01:27:39.655 --> 01:27:41.788
If we cave in now they win.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:44.825
Oh come on, Wally.

01:27:46.394 --> 01:27:49.463
- Hey it's 15 million dollars

01:27:49.465 --> 01:27:50.931
and jobs back Jake.

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:56.703
- You can have the jobs back,

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:59.706
but just so we're clear
you don't get the 15 until

01:27:59.708 --> 01:28:02.442
all the guns are gone.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:04.444
- Oh yeah that's clear.

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.482
- What about BB guns?

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:13.620
- And they say there's no such
thing as a stupid question.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.422
- Is that a no.

01:28:15.424 --> 01:28:16.657
- That's a no.

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:20.727
- I liked him better
when he was dead.

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:37.744
- Hello champ.

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:44.484
What you doing out here?

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:45.486
- Thinking.

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:52.759
- Listen I wanted to thank you,

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:57.931
for talking to me yesterday.

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:00.767
Telling me how you
felt about things.

01:29:00.769 --> 01:29:04.671
I know that isn't always
an easy thing to do.

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:07.908
And I want you to
know it affected me.

01:29:09.410 --> 01:29:10.410
A lot.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.815
One of the reasons
I gave up my guns.

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:19.419
- But how about the
balance of power shifting

01:29:19.421 --> 01:29:20.887
and all that?

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:24.624
- Well Lance the power of
power isn't as delicate

01:29:24.626 --> 01:29:26.927
a thing as you might think.

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:30.864
See having the guts
to be vulnerable

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.669
and admit that you're wrong,

01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:37.904
that's a sign of strength,

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.840
not weakness.

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:42.909
You understand?

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:46.046
- I think so.

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.048
- Good.

01:29:49.784 --> 01:29:54.554
- Is sex really the most
important thing to us men?

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:55.856
- Absolutely son.

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:05.165
- 44 days after the sex
strike of Rockford began

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:08.802
the strike appears to
be unofficially over.

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.905
All but 252 citizens have agreed

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:14.741
to dispose of their firearms.

01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:16.042
Towns people say they
are still working

01:30:16.044 --> 01:30:17.944
on convincing those holdouts.

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:21.181
95 of whom are women
to join the converted.

01:30:21.183 --> 01:30:24.484
In the meantime all
indications are that things

01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:27.954
I Rockford are returning
back to normal.

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:29.656
- Honey I'm home.

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:34.762
Oh damn.

01:30:38.032 --> 01:30:39.800
These are for you.

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:43.537
- And this is for the flowers.

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.746
- What about a vase?

01:30:56.617 --> 01:31:00.554
- Are you a stallion or are
you a little bitch mare?

01:31:00.556 --> 01:31:02.456
Want me to whip you
in terms of shape?

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:03.890
You want me to whip
you into shape,

01:31:03.892 --> 01:31:05.091
you little shit?

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:08.762
What the hell kind
of sound is that?

01:31:08.764 --> 01:31:09.930
You sound like an old woman
coughing up a hair ball,

01:31:09.932 --> 01:31:11.531
you little shit.

01:31:42.865 --> 01:31:43.964
- bill

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:59.779
- god damn liberals,
what the fuck.
