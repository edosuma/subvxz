00:02.202 --> 00:03.602
<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>
<i>is recorded</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:06.005
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:08.340
Oh, wow. Hey.
Why are you guys so dressed up?

00:08.342 --> 00:11.176
Oh, we are taking boyd to see
his first shakespeare play.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.678
Oh, he's 7. Pshh.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.346
Isn't he a little young
for "hamlet"?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.882
Nope. This version's cut down
to 15 minutes,

00:16.884 --> 00:19.518
And everybody but ophelia
is played by a sock puppet.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.689
He actually might be
too old for this.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.791
Well, dad's taking boyd
to the rodeo next week,

00:25.793 --> 00:28.293
And we are just trying
to balance it out.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.862
My prediction --
rodeo wins.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.929
Yee-haw!

00:33.733 --> 00:36.068
[ gasps ] oh, my god!
What happened, honey?

00:36.070 --> 00:38.404
I fell off my bike.
Are -- are you okay?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.406
I thought I was.
Oh --

00:41.574 --> 00:45.244
I told him he was fine.
Don't give him any options.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.912
Uh, how could he
fall off his bike

00:46.914 --> 00:48.514
If it has
training wheels, mike?

00:48.516 --> 00:49.982
'cause I took them off.

00:49.984 --> 00:52.584
If you're not falling,
you're not learning.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.253
Yeah, you know
what else you're not doing?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.521
Falling. Okay?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.156
Did you hit your head?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.158
No. He hit his knee.
Did you hit<i> your</i> head?

01:00.260 --> 01:02.861
Okay. Come on.
Let's go get you cleaned up.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.663
There's nothing wrong
with kids getting hurt.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.432
That's why we had
four daughters.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.434
You had
an older sister,

01:08.436 --> 01:10.936
But she just kept running
around the house with scissors.

01:12.372 --> 01:14.339
Okay, dad, we don't want boyd
taking any risks.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.008
He's going through
a clumsy phase.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.077
If he doesn't try
doing things he's bad at,

01:18.079 --> 01:19.778
He'll never be
great at anything.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.046
Ryan understands.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.247
You're canadian.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.684
Hockey, bacon,
celine dion.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.053
Do you want me to keep going?
'cause I will.

01:28.055 --> 01:31.256
Actually, I do,
'cause I think that's it.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.293
Here he is!
Good as new.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.628
And if any
of his classmates ask,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.397
He got that fighting ninjas.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.466
I think
what we learned today

01:40.468 --> 01:42.734
Is that someone shouldn't
be riding their bike without
their training wheels.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.303
No,
the headline here is,

01:44.305 --> 01:46.138
He got almost all the way down
to larabee's house

01:46.140 --> 01:47.806
Without
the training wheels.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.641
Really?
He got that far?
Yeah.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.477
You know, actually,
I'm not surprised.

01:51.479 --> 01:55.547
In college I used to ride
a unicycle to class.

01:55.549 --> 01:58.450
A lot of eyes
on this guy.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.719
I bet you sure miss
clown college.

02:00.721 --> 02:04.123
Uh, honey, we talked
about this, okay?

02:04.125 --> 02:05.791
Boyd is
just not ready.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.594
You're probably right, mom.
I'm not ready.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.663
Let's go see the sad play
that I won't understand.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.566
Dad, I need your word.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.302
No more bike rides
without training wheels.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.838
The only reason
I'm do--
no, mike. You know what?
We've had our say.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.474
And as usual, you have had
both of our says.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.878
Now it's time to let
them go watch a tube
sock contemplate suicide.

02:28.414 --> 02:30.182
All right.
You have my word.

02:30.184 --> 02:33.752
No more riding bikes
without training wheels.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.256
Well, does that look like fun?
Do you want to do that?

02:40.026 --> 02:41.960
I sure do, mr. B.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.696
Kyle.
I'm talking to the kid.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.931
Right.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.068
-- Captions by vitac --

02:55.108 --> 02:56.808
And the answer is?

02:56.810 --> 02:58.510
I got "x" equals -7.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.512
Correct.
[ chuckles ]

03:00.514 --> 03:02.614
Five points
for gryffindor!

03:03.716 --> 03:07.019
Now I'll teach you guys a trick
for multiplying factorials.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.387
I need a visual aid.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.722
Justin, can you grab us
eight bottles of soda?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.191
Yeah, sure.

03:13.726 --> 03:14.960
I'll be right back.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.663
Thank you, justin.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.631
Oh, and, uh, one point
for slytherin.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.137
Will you go to prom
with me?

03:26.306 --> 03:29.174
What? No. I have a boyfriend,
and he's 20 feet away.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.910
Yeah, I know. I calculated.
I got about 12 seconds.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.913
So, can I pick you up
at like 6:00?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.915
I told you.
I'm not interested.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.817
But look at
how cute we'd be together.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.588
Whoa.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.690
Why are we in paris?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.692
Why is the sky red?

03:46.694 --> 03:49.061
I factored in
climate change.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.896
The future's bleak.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.131
That's why we should live
in love now!

03:56.236 --> 03:58.237
Anyway, that's why you're
left with the variable "y."

03:58.239 --> 03:59.338
[ chuckles lightly ]

03:59.340 --> 04:01.873
Why, eve? Why?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.342
[ doorbell rings ]

04:03.344 --> 04:06.378
I'm gonna get the door.
[ sighs ]

04:06.380 --> 04:09.881
Did you ask eve out again
while I was in the kitchen?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.351
Why? Are you guys having
problems?

04:14.287 --> 04:15.687
Hey.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.723
Hey.
I'm here to get boyd.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.124
My dad took him
to outdoor man.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.226
I really wish
mike had told me that.

04:21.228 --> 04:22.628
Yeah.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.497
He was gonna call you,
but then he thought, "eh."

04:26.466 --> 04:28.700
Wait. They didn't take
boyd's bike, did they?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.203
No. They drove.
It's like 10 miles, dude.

04:31.205 --> 04:34.640
[ sighs ] what is he doing?
Kristin's gonna kill me.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.643
Eve! Eve!

04:37.645 --> 04:39.811
Andrew,
what are you doing?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.014
Shh! Justin thinks
I'm in the kitchen.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.217
So, prom?
What do you say?

04:49.255 --> 04:52.224
Hey, do you want anything?
Andrew's in the kitchen.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.264
He's holding on good.
Look at that.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.099
See?

05:01.101 --> 05:03.001
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.070
Look. He's popping back up
and gettin' right back on.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.005
You want to be
just like him.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.440
Hey, hey, hey.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.176
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's not your sheep!

05:11.178 --> 05:12.844
Mutton head.
Get out of here.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.646
All right.
You're up next, boyd.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.649
Good deal. Just hold on.
Have some fun.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.951
Boyd.
Hi, dad.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.953
What are you doing,
mike?
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.356
I promised no more bikes
without training wheels.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.692
I said nothing
about robot sheep.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.361
Okay, boyd, come on down
from there. I don't want
you to hurt yourself.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.296
Kyle,
don't take him down.
Kyle, take him down.

05:31.298 --> 05:34.032
Awkward moment
involving a sheep.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.801
I've been here before.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.303
See, you can't keep telling boyd
he's not good at things.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.305
He's gonna start
listening to you.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.542
He's not as good as I am
about tuning you out.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.278
Dad, can I
please try the sheep?

05:46.280 --> 05:48.647
Listen. He rode a bike for
almost half a block without
the training wheels.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.882
Okay.
All right, fine.
Yeah?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.884
But on
the lowest setting, kyle.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.953
[ sighs ]

05:56.289 --> 05:57.389
Look at that.
Huh?

05:57.391 --> 05:58.623
I'm doing it.
Whoops!

05:59.726 --> 06:01.393
Holy crap!
Boyd, don't try to move!

06:01.395 --> 06:04.796
I'm okay.
But I guess you're right.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.398
I am
not good at this.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.067
Mike: You can't stop life
from knocking kids down.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.969
The best we can do
is help them to get back up.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.472
You want to give it
another try?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.244
There you go.
All right.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.846
All right, hang on boyd.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.614
I'm cranking it
all the way to "trot".

06:24.417 --> 06:26.485
Look.
He's doing it.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.086
Way to go, boyd!
Wave!

06:28.088 --> 06:30.422
That's probably not a good idea.
He'll -- no.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.858
Oh! Sorry!
Oh, my bad!

06:32.860 --> 06:34.693
Hop up.
Let's go, kid. Come on.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.529
This time, try to
just squeeze your legs
around the animal there.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.097
All right.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.601
There you go. See that?
H-hold on.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.603
He's doing good.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.406
Yeah, he is. I-I try to get him
to not give up on things,

06:47.408 --> 06:49.207
But kristin's
so stubborn.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.776
So you just give up?

06:50.778 --> 06:51.777
Yeah.

06:51.779 --> 06:55.113
Well, take a lesson from
your kid. Stick to your guns.

06:55.115 --> 06:59.618
Or...The u.N. Or whatever you
liberals use to defend yourself.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.453
Wow,
look at that.
Mike: Huh?

07:01.455 --> 07:04.356
That kid's screwed on there
like a tick.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.726
The miracles of
microengineering.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.628
Oh, yeah.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.897
You know, our store
is sponsoring mutton busting

07:11.899 --> 07:13.732
At the rodeo
this weekend.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.134
Mm-hmm.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.970
You know, uh, if boyd can
ride that lamb-droid, I bet
he can ride the real thing.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.572
Hmm?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.641
I would like to see him
get a trophy.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.543
Oh, he -- he's got
plenty of trophies.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.378
I'm not talking about the kind
you get for just showing up.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.313
I'm talking about
the kind of trophy they give you

07:28.315 --> 07:30.148
When you're better at things
than other people.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.384
He does not have
one of those.

07:32.386 --> 07:35.120
Yeah, we could use
a kid like boyd.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.955
Last year, the sheep
were throwing kids off

07:36.957 --> 07:39.057
Like -- like ticks shedding
their -- their outer skin.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.563
All right, it was tick week
on the discovery channel.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.832
Mike, I don't know
about convincing kristin.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.401
A-a real sheep has got
to be more dangerous
than this one, right?

07:49.403 --> 07:50.635
No, no, no, no.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.170
Only in one respect.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.672
Ticks?

07:53.674 --> 07:56.141
Forget sharks.
Forget grizzly bears.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.677
Ticks are
the perfect killing machine.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.345
Are they really?
Uh-huh.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.514
The perfect killing machine,
and yet you can stop them

08:02.516 --> 08:05.584
By tucking your pants
into your socks.

08:13.793 --> 08:15.694
Ugh.
I'm done with men.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.931
Well, it's a good choice,
because we are the worst.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.233
Vanessa:
[ chuckles ]

08:21.235 --> 08:24.936
Honey, what's going on?
Is andrew still bugging
you to go out with him?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.605
Yeah,
but that's so constant,

08:26.607 --> 08:29.207
I've tuned it out like
the hum of the refrigerator.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.776
The refrigerator
doesn't hum.

08:37.683 --> 08:41.052
Oh. Now that's
gonna drive me crazy.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.654
I like this andrew.
I really do.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.222
He kind of reminds me
of richard nixon.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.724
Really?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.225
You met andrew once,

08:47.227 --> 08:49.127
And you pay him
your highest compliment?

08:49.129 --> 08:52.030
Nixon was a go-getter.
He courted pat for years.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.733
She kept saying no.
He just wore her down.
He's not a quitter.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.801
Yep.
Right up until he resigned.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.472
I'm talking
about justin, okay?

09:00.474 --> 09:02.674
I told him I would go to prom
with him on Saturday,

09:02.676 --> 09:04.476
But he wants me
to wear a dress.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.245
Okay. I want to be angry for
you, but you're just gonna --

09:07.247 --> 09:09.581
You're gonna have to give me
more to work with.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.651
Okay. So, j-rotsee cadets
are allowed to wear their
formal uniforms, right?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.185
Right, okay.

09:14.187 --> 09:17.188
Justin's wearing his,
but he told me I can't.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.592
What? You want to wear your
little soldier costume to prom?

09:20.594 --> 09:23.595
No! Come on!

09:23.597 --> 09:26.631
You're there to turn heads,
not blow them off.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.200
I say cut this guy loose.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.937
It's not justin's job

12:15.368 --> 12:17.669
So, this was
my father's idea.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.871
Yes. But for once,
I actually agree with him.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.573
You know, it'll be good
for boyd's confidence.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.175
He'll walk with a little more
spring in his step.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.845
Because of
the compound fracture.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.580
He will either win,

12:28.582 --> 12:29.881
Or he'll get practice
dealing with not winning,

12:29.883 --> 12:31.716
Which will be a win.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.552
And if it's not, he'll
get practice dealing
with the not winning,

12:34.554 --> 12:37.956
Which will also be a win, so
it's like a win-win-win-win-win?

Okay, look, I know everybody
thinks that I'm overreacting,

12:41.294 --> 12:45.463

enough, so I am saying no.

Yes. I'm the mom.

Or am I boyd's co-parent
and your equal partner?

We are totally equal.
I am just also the tie-breaker.

I have no status here.

But I realized
I did want to go.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.348
[ doorbell rings ]

19:10.350 --> 19:11.782
I'm gonna get
the camera.
Okay, okay.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.784
Um, yeah, I'm -- I'm so glad
you're going,

19:13.786 --> 19:16.087
But I don't like
that you caved in to justin.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.123
Hi. I'm here
to pick up eve.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.525
Eve, nixon's here.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.096
Wow.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.831
Uh, honey.
Um, just, I'm...Confused.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.867
I mean, I saw you on the porch
with justin. I-I...

19:29.869 --> 19:31.502
Oh, I'm keeping
my options open.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.204
I mean, let's face it.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.940
Neither one of these guys
are gonna end up mr. Eve baxter.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.710
Hey. I --
I don't know about that.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.646
I mean, ginny weasley
didn't think

19:41.648 --> 19:44.215
She was gonna end up
with harry potter, either.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.986
Dad, we're leaving.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.122
Hey.
Before you guys take off,

19:51.124 --> 19:54.792
How about you and I take
a little tour of my gun cabinet?

19:57.529 --> 19:59.297
He's already terrified
of<i> me.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:05.036
It's true.
I hurled a lot on the way here.

20:05.038 --> 20:09.473
Chances for a kiss
just went from 1% to zero.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.309
What about one more?
Get together --

20:11.311 --> 20:12.476
Okay,
that's it.
Look like --
look like you're having fun.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.911
Have a good time.
There you go.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.546
Enjoy yourselves.
All right.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.014
You look beautiful!

20:17.016 --> 20:18.849
Take care of her.
Take care of her, all right?

20:18.851 --> 20:21.419
That kid sweats
like nixon.

20:23.322 --> 20:27.491
I am so proud of eve standing up
for herself like that.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.060
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.494
She figured out what she wanted,
and she went for it.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.396
In a way,
I did, too.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.099
Mom, I have
something to tell you.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.601
[ chuckles ]

20:36.603 --> 20:38.436
And, mike,
I have to thank you

20:38.438 --> 20:40.771
For helping me
work on<i> my</i> persistence.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.107
Don't thank me.
You don't have to thank me.
I hung in there
with kris...

20:43.109 --> 20:44.942
There you go.
...And now we are,
uh...

20:44.944 --> 20:48.045
Vanessa and kristin:
Oh, my god!

20:48.047 --> 20:50.281
[ shouting indistinctly ]

20:50.283 --> 20:53.117
Vanessa:
I'm so happy for you!

20:53.119 --> 20:55.753
I told kris firmly that I wanted
to get married, and she agreed.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.421
And it's
all thanks to you...

20:57.423 --> 20:59.357
Dad.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.867
I -- I just wanted the kid
to learn how to ride a bike.
