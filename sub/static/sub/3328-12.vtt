WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.469
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.500 --> 00:03.728
WATSON:
He's only loved one person

00:03.770 --> 00:05.499
in his life,
as far as I can tell,

00:05.530 --> 00:06.599
and she was murdered.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.198
MAN: _
My name IS Moriarty.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.208
I believe we're overdue
for a chat.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.676
(groans)

00:13.710 --> 00:15.177
Moriarty said you
weren't to be harmed,

00:15.210 --> 00:17.303
but then, a few hours ago,
she tried

00:17.350 --> 00:19.079
to have me
killed.
"Shell?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.076
(gunshots)

00:21.580 --> 00:23.184
Moriarty.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.108
So who was the man
I spoke to on the phone?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.118
You talked to one
of my lieutenants.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.219
He has, over the years,
played the role repeatedly.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.352
HOLMES:
You said

00:30.390 --> 00:32.449
there was only one
person in the world

00:32.500 --> 00:33.694
who_ could
surprise you.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.198
Turns out there's two.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.363
I'm going to get a coffee
with a guy from TrueRomantix.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.230
I told him I only
have an hour, so

00:46.280 --> 00:48.271
if he is a dud,

00:48.310 --> 00:49.800
I will be
back soon.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.239
I'm certain it will be
a profound experience

00:52.280 --> 00:55.147
for the both
of you.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.579
Are you out of clean laundry?

00:59.190 --> 01:00.179
Enjoy.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.552
*

01:37.230 --> 01:39.824
HOLMES:
We have spilled much ink,
you and I,

01:39.860 --> 01:42.328
in our discussion
of human connection...

01:44.670 --> 01:47.332
...and we're no closer
to understanding

01:47.370 --> 01:51.329
than we were when
the correspondence began.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.704
on one side of a wide chasm,

01:54.740 --> 01:56.549
shouting across,

01:56.580 --> 01:59.845
and wondering if the response
I hear comes from you,

01:59.880 --> 02:01.745
or if it is my own voice

02:01.780 --> 02:05.318
echoing back to me.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.409
It seems to me,
on my side of the canyon,

02:07.460 --> 02:10.258
that the search
for unity with another

02:10.290 --> 02:12.429
is the font of much of
the world's unhappiness.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.869
I watch as Watson, eager as
everto extract some meaning

02:17.900 --> 02:19.697
from the prevailing
social conventions,

02:19.740 --> 02:23.699
endures a series of
curated mating rItuals.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.799
It seems to me that
she's Incrementally

02:25.840 --> 02:28.274
less content each time
she returns from one.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.917
I conduct myself as though

02:32.950 --> 02:35.316
I'm above matters of the heart,

02:35.350 --> 02:39.582
chiefly because I have seen
them corrodepeople I respect.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.611
But in my candid moments,

02:41.660 --> 02:44.254
I sometimes wonder if I take
the stance I dobecause love,

02:44.290 --> 02:46.326
for lack of a better word,

02:46.360 --> 02:48.624
is a game I fail
to understand,

02:48.660 --> 02:50.867
and so I opt not to play.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.333
After all, ifI truly had

02:57.370 --> 03:00.476
the purity of all
my convictions,

03:00.510 --> 03:02.876
I wouldn't regret
so many of the things

03:02.910 --> 03:04.878
I've done.

03:04.910 --> 03:06.514
Nor would I persist,

03:06.550 --> 03:09.417
against so many
of my better instincts,

03:09.450 --> 03:12.658
in this correspondence.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.351
I find you a challenge,

03:14.390 --> 03:16.858
one that, in spite of all
that you've done,

03:16.890 --> 03:21.395
continues to stimulate.

03:21.430 --> 03:25.526
And so the conversation, futile
though it may finally be,

03:25.570 --> 03:28.835
continues,
and we are left to wonder:

03:28.870 --> 03:31.998
have we simply failed to find
the answers to the questions

03:32.040 --> 03:33.905
that preoccupy us...

03:33.940 --> 03:37.842
or can they not be answered
at all?

03:37.880 --> 03:40.417
Fortunately for both of us,

03:40.450 --> 03:44.443
the world always presents
the next diversion...

03:44.490 --> 03:48.517
the next elaborate distraction
from the problems that vex.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.982
(device beeping)

03:52.500 --> 03:55.253
We're good.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.345
(drill whirs)

04:22.020 --> 04:23.419
(gasps)

04:36.770 --> 04:38.704
Kayden.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.599
GREGSON: The victim's name
was Max Fuller.

05:18.650 --> 05:22.609
British national,
some kind of old money.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.083
His ancestors built
the railroads

05:24.120 --> 05:26.554
that connects London
and Manchester.

05:26.590 --> 05:27.784
Sometime after midnight,

05:27.820 --> 05:29.788
they disabled
the alarm, got past

05:29.830 --> 05:31.024
past a state-
of-the art deadbolt

05:31.060 --> 05:34.393
and a steel-plated
cage door.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.829
They encountered
Mr. Fuller

05:35.860 --> 05:36.861
on their way upstairs

05:36.900 --> 05:38.720
to his daughter
Kayden's bedroom.

05:38.770 --> 05:42.866
Mrs. Fuller woke up
about an hour later,

05:42.910 --> 05:44.798
discovered her husband
was gone.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.000
Went out to the stairs,

05:46.040 --> 05:47.803
found the body.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.944
Did the kidnappers
leave a note?

05:49.980 --> 05:52.574
Nothing. The FBI's
on their way down now.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.975
I'd like to see the child's
bedroom, please.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.942
(phone rings)

05:58.190 --> 06:00.112
No caller ID.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.527
Just a question mark.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.420
Mrs. Fuller,

06:08.460 --> 06:10.621
are you up
for this?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.034
Hello?

06:17.070 --> 06:18.765
MAN:
Good evening, Miss Fuller.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.505
Who is this?

06:20.540 --> 06:22.576
My name hardly matters.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.874
Suffice it to say that
you and I are about to embark

06:24.910 --> 06:26.969
on a brief but intense affair.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.683
Would the other parties present
care to announce themselves?

06:31.690 --> 06:32.816
This is Captain Tom Gregson

06:32.860 --> 06:34.987
of the NYPD. I'm listening.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.581
Congratulations on beating your
federal colleagues to the scene.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.996
When they arrive, please tell
them that this can be

06:41.030 --> 06:44.067
a simple transaction,
provided no one mucks it up.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.864
The price for the safe
return of Kayden Fuller

06:46.900 --> 06:48.788
is $50 million.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.432
I know that voice.

06:50.470 --> 06:51.437
GREGSON:
$50 million.

06:51.470 --> 06:52.437
It's Moriarty.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.833
Could you tell me...?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.939
Moriarty is a woman
and she is in jail.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.608
It's the man who pretended
to be Moriarty.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.447
The one who tried to hire us.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.016
Consolidate the funds
and be ready

07:02.050 --> 07:03.688
to issue payment, Ms. Fuller.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.210
I'll be in touch
with further details.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.911
It does sound like him.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.780
Was he on long enough?
Did you get anything?

07:08.820 --> 07:09.889
Captain.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.695
The man you just spoke with

07:16.730 --> 07:19.028
is one of Moriarty's
lieutenants.

07:19.070 --> 07:20.037
As in your Moriarty?

07:20.070 --> 07:21.560
I've spoken with him
before myself.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.908
I'm quite certain.

07:22.940 --> 07:26.876
Moriarty's agents do not act
without her leave.

07:26.910 --> 07:28.207
She's somewhere in this.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.242
I would like to speak with her.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.770
You can't just walk

07:31.810 --> 07:32.947
into the supermax wing
at Newgate.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.777
It shouldn't be
overly difficult.

07:34.820 --> 07:38.984
I know for a fact I'm on
her list of approved visitors.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.011
Well, I'll work on that.

07:43.060 --> 07:47.997
How do you know that you're
on her list of visitors?

07:49.260 --> 07:51.194
There must be 30 letters here.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.959
27. The first one arrived

07:53.000 --> 07:55.594
shortly before we
left for London.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.234
Moriarty sends them
to a post office box
I maintain in the Bronx.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.977
I've no idea how
she learned of it.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.001
I began to reply
after the fifth one.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.200
She said she was on the verge
of quitting the correspondence.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.172
And you didn't
want that?
Of course not.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.949
Whatever my history
with the woman,

08:08.980 --> 08:10.743
she remains a criminal genius.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.758
Her mind and her methods
are worthy of study.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.054
Oh, so all this is
in the name of science?

08:15.090 --> 08:16.751
Of course.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.519
Any detective would
relish the chance

08:18.560 --> 08:20.027
to analyze how
she thinks.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.049
I'm a detective.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.692
You didn't show me
these letters.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.095
You hid them
in a beehive.

08:24.130 --> 08:26.564
This exchange is
an entirely good thing.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.192
I've maintained a relationship
with Moriarty,

08:28.240 --> 08:30.606
which in turn, should make it
easier to learn

08:30.640 --> 08:32.005
what Faux-riarty is up to.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.109
Faux-riarty?

08:33.140 --> 08:35.608
The man who pretended
to be Moriarty. Do you have

08:35.640 --> 08:37.005
a better name for him?

08:37.050 --> 08:39.610
(phone rings)

08:39.650 --> 08:40.844
Captain.

08:40.880 --> 08:41.915
We're on.

08:41.950 --> 08:44.839
The three of us can see
your gIrl In the morning.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.915
Excellent.
Shall we drive out together?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.781
Holmes,
she's not in Newgate anymore.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.061
Brooklyn Naw Yard?

08:58.100 --> 09:00.261
I thought it was all malls
and condos now.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.939
Not quite. Government
still owns some of it.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.609
You have no idea
the rabbit hole

09:05.640 --> 09:07.107
you sent me down
last night.

09:07.140 --> 09:10.348
Nobody's answering my questions,
not exactly.

09:10.380 --> 09:13.144
Reading between
the lines,

09:13.180 --> 09:16.115
the feds keep
this section restricted.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.788
HOLMES:
We're headed
into a black site.

09:17.820 --> 09:20.152
Those are your words,
not mine.

09:20.190 --> 09:23.023
The FBI and Scotland Yard
are working together

09:23.060 --> 09:24.857
to build a case
against Moriarty.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.859
She hasn't admitted
to being at the center

09:27.900 --> 09:30.164
of any criminal conspiracies,
but she has admitted

09:30.200 --> 09:35.160
that, uh, various pieces of
information have made it to her.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.806
She's been trading on that
ever since we turned her over.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.138
So she's secured herself
some more comfortable digs.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.704
Yeah. "Concessions have
been made."

09:42.750 --> 09:45.002
That's how
the SAC put it.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.177
Captain Gregson?
I'm Ramses Mattoo.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.189
I dot the Is
around here.
How do you do?

09:50.220 --> 09:52.916
Please follow me.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.383
The facilities can scale up
or down depending on the needs

09:55.420 --> 09:57.980
of the moment, but right now
we've only got one guest.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.157
WATSON:
This woman has planned
God knows how many murders,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.827
and you give her
her own warehouse?

10:01.860 --> 10:03.896
As I understand it,
the pieces of intelligence

10:03.930 --> 10:06.660
she's offering have been
game changers.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.737
If it's any consolation to you,
she's not living in luxury.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.237
She gets her art supplies

10:11.270 --> 10:13.135
and a copy of the Ledger
every morning.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.899
I only keep her
locked in.

10:15.940 --> 10:18.044
You seem like a competent man,
Agent Mattoo.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.718
I'm sure you're aware

10:19.750 --> 10:21.911
that your charge
is a vile seductress.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.042
She's capable of manipulations

10:23.090 --> 10:25.411
I can only describe
as mind-bending.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.213
I've been briefed.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.057
As for the
"seductress" part,

10:29.090 --> 10:31.126
I'm the only one
who interacts with her,

10:31.160 --> 10:32.752
and I've been screened
for suitability

10:32.800 --> 10:34.051
to this particular inmate.

10:34.100 --> 10:38.025
The brass is confident
I can resist her charms.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.436
How in the hell do
they screen for that?

10:40.470 --> 10:42.904
He's saying he isn't
interested in women, Captain.

10:42.940 --> 10:45.932
It's not a bad idea,
actually.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.404
But seduction isn't the only
game she knows how to play.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.717
It's really remarkable.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.217
Excuse me?

10:55.250 --> 10:56.808
I knew she
was talented,

10:56.850 --> 10:59.717
but as far
as I can tell,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.387
she captured everything.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.678
(device trills)

11:29.120 --> 11:30.439
You look a bit tired.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.481
You look a bit evil.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.681
Joan.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.088
Of course, Sherlock's told me

11:37.130 --> 11:38.381
you're doing well.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.193
Although I'm sorry
to hear your efforts

11:40.230 --> 11:42.721
to find a soul mate
haven't been fruitful.

11:44.500 --> 11:49.233
I'd, um, hoped to show you
my work someplace less bleak.

11:49.270 --> 11:51.500
More conducive to conversation.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.508
Perhaps if you come see me
in a year?

11:53.540 --> 11:57.078
In a year you will be serving
multiple life sentences.

11:58.110 --> 11:59.919
Captain,

11:59.950 --> 12:01.508
I've been scouring the paper
for answers,

12:01.550 --> 12:03.279
but I have to admit,

12:03.320 --> 12:06.187
I haven't the foggiest idea
why you're here.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.256
It happened too late
for the morning edition.

12:08.290 --> 12:12.124
A seven-year-old girl
by the name of Kayden Fuller

12:12.160 --> 12:13.320
was abducted last night.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.499
The kidnappers murdered
her father,

12:15.530 --> 12:20.991
and they're asking
for $50 million.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.337
You recognize
that name?

12:22.370 --> 12:25.305
Of course. Uriah Fuller built
the railroads

12:25.340 --> 12:26.932
that connect
London to Manchester.

12:26.980 --> 12:30.040
But if you're here because
you think I took the girl,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.810
you're going
to be disappointed.

12:32.850 --> 12:36.172
I'm afraid that a kidnapping
for ransom has

12:36.220 --> 12:38.780
quite a few moving parts.
Too many for my tastes.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.516
Why, then, did your lieutenant
make the ransom call?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.323
You know the man
I'm referring to.

12:43.360 --> 12:47.421
You had him call Watson and I,
pretend to be you.

12:47.460 --> 12:50.463
Yes, he always was ambitious.

12:52.330 --> 12:58.007
I, um, could give you
his name, of course.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.133
His likeness,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.239
the names and faces
of those he likely recruited.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.283
If you do help us,
I'll continue our correspondence

13:10.320 --> 13:12.311
for as long
as you're incarcerated.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.386
You're going to do that anyway.

13:16.120 --> 13:20.989
My hosts have a list
of favors that I'd like.

13:21.030 --> 13:23.396
If they'd review it,
grant me a few,

13:23.430 --> 13:27.332
well, then I'd be happy
to lend my insights.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.478
(rustling)

13:36.510 --> 13:39.399
MAN:
This needn't be
unpleasant, you know.

13:39.450 --> 13:42.442
You'd be back with Mom and Dad
soon enough.

13:45.350 --> 13:49.081
But I'd very much like
to get to know you.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.884
And cribbage is a brilliant way
to do that.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.900
(knocking)

14:07.480 --> 14:09.436
Excuse me a moment, Kayden.

14:22.420 --> 14:23.887
Sorry to interrupt, guv.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.579
It's just, the boys
are getting a bit jumpy.

14:25.630 --> 14:28.952
It'd help morale
ifI could tell 'em something.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.561
Tell them we
all stand to profit
handsomely from this.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.899
Everyone's wondering,
any word from her yet?

14:35.940 --> 14:39.501
She's in federal custody,
Clay. It'll take time.

14:39.540 --> 14:42.600
But we'll hear from
Moriarty soon enough.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.442
WATSON :
You okay?

14:52.490 --> 14:55.311
It's the first time you saw
Moriarty since...

14:55.360 --> 14:56.384
everything.

14:56.420 --> 14:57.159
That had to be hard.

14:57.190 --> 15:00.489
I did not expect her
to cooperate.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.349
Of course, I was hoping

15:01.400 --> 15:03.322
she might reveal
something inadvertently.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.588
I didn't mean "hard" as in
a difficult problem to solve.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.439
I meant emotionally hard.

15:07.470 --> 15:10.633
Oh, but it's all science
to you, right?

15:10.670 --> 15:13.377
I'm just curious: what was the
empirical value in writing

15:13.410 --> 15:15.071
to her about my dating life?

15:15.110 --> 15:16.509
MA'I'I'OO:
Excuse me.
Well...

15:16.540 --> 15:18.542
I'm looking for
Captain Gregson.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.689
Oh, my good Lord.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.320
Why have you brought her here?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.521
Considering the dire
circumstances,

15:33.560 --> 15:35.323
the government's agreed
to a favor.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.067
I've decided
to help you after all.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.159
For the duration of
this investigation,

15:40.200 --> 15:45.206
the NYPD has the full use of
my knowledge and faculties.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.334
I'm certain we'll
work well together.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.473
I'm told you rely
heavily on consultants.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.518
Given your history, I can
understand why you wouldn't want

16:01.560 --> 16:03.255
to take her up on her offer.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.520
When Ms. Moriarty was first
taken into custody,

16:05.560 --> 16:08.199
RFID chips were implanted
in both her hands.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.323
She can't move five feet
without us knowing.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.997
She's gone.

16:12.030 --> 16:14.430
Just thought you should get
used to hearing that.

16:14.470 --> 16:17.132
Chips aren't going to stop her.

16:17.170 --> 16:18.307
As you can see,

16:18.340 --> 16:21.275
she has been equipped with
special security bracelets;

16:21.310 --> 16:23.778
like handcuffs
that are not connected.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.176
Handcuffs that don't connect.
Shoot me now.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.041
They're incapacitants.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.274
Stun guns pointing right at her.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.187
Each with a payload of 50,000
volts that can be triggered

16:32.220 --> 16:34.211
by any member of the detail
with the touch of a button.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.558
Then you've taken her out
before, haven't you?

16:39.060 --> 16:41.119
Captain, inviting this
woman into our investigation

16:41.160 --> 16:43.196
would be, in a
word, idiotic.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.790
The kidnappers are being led
by her former lieutenant.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.697
He is, in all likelihood,
operating under her orders.

16:48.740 --> 16:53.177
During her incarceration,
Ms. Moriarty has had zero access

16:53.210 --> 16:55.030
to technology that would
allow her

16:55.080 --> 16:56.638
to communicate
with the outside world.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.148
She's been allowed to write
letters, but only to you.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.216
So unless you are
passing instructions
to her old assets...

17:01.250 --> 17:03.309
She could've helped us
from her cell, couldn't she?

17:03.350 --> 17:05.784
Given us the names,
information we needed?

17:05.820 --> 17:07.310
Why bring her here?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.157
As per her request; obviously,

17:09.190 --> 17:11.249
part of the deal she just struck
with your superiors.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.484
The building
that you're keeping her in,

17:12.530 --> 17:14.293
it might not be a prison,

17:14.330 --> 17:16.093
but it did seem
adequately secure.

17:16.130 --> 17:18.166
She'd have a much easier time
trying to escape

17:18.200 --> 17:19.792
whilst out and about, no?

17:19.830 --> 17:22.492
The bottom line is that she has
cashed in some big chips

17:22.540 --> 17:24.735
to be an active participant.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.499
Her preference
is to work with you.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.373
If you don't take her...
FBI will.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.447
MORIARTY:
His name is Devon Gaspar.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.152
H_e's former _British
military intelligence.
And yet,

17:40.190 --> 17:41.282
were you to ask for his records,

17:41.320 --> 17:43.254
they would deny
that he ever existed.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.656
_ Devon has several
aliases that I'm aware of.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.488
I've already shared them
with Mr. Mattoo.

17:48.530 --> 17:51.260
I've also prepared some sketches
of the men I believe

17:51.300 --> 17:52.528
he may be working with.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.663
GREGSON:
Well, obviously,
we can't

17:54.700 --> 17:56.429
distribute these to the media.

17:56.470 --> 17:57.767
If they're legit,

17:57.810 --> 17:59.801
that would spook
the kidnappers.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.276
But we can put
them out in-house.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.607
We'll issue a FINEST message.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.369
And every cop in the city
will get an e-mail.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.876
I'll make sure the Bureau does
the same.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.388
Excellent. Then I do believe
we're finished here.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.682
Lovely to see you, as always,

18:12.720 --> 18:15.154
but we have a terrified
little girl to find.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.329
Our best to the gang
at the warehouse.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.850
Actually,
I was rather

18:18.890 --> 18:20.448
hoping to take a look
at the crime scene.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.223
MA'I'I'OO:
We did promise her

18:23.270 --> 18:24.225
access to the Fuller residence.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.726
That is our next stop.

18:25.770 --> 18:27.692
Actually, we have
more important things to do.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.765
For example, checking that even
one iota of the information

18:29.800 --> 18:31.631
she's given us is true.
WATSON: You know what?

18:31.670 --> 18:34.275
I will go with them to the
house, you take care of that.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.301
Um, if anything comes up,
I will call you.

18:42.820 --> 18:45.380
MORIARTY:
Quite lovely, isn't she?

18:45.420 --> 18:48.184
I can only imagine
how frightened she must be.

18:48.220 --> 18:51.280
You can stop
pretending to care now.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.821
The others
can't hear you.

18:53.860 --> 18:56.397
Would you be
surprised to learn

18:56.430 --> 18:59.922
you've been on my mind,
Joan Watson?

18:59.970 --> 19:02.268
Not really.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.202
I don't typically
misread people, but...

19:06.240 --> 19:09.573
you're more clever
than I initially estimated.

19:09.610 --> 19:11.749
More interesting.

19:11.780 --> 19:14.476
If you weren't,
I would never have been caught.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.387
I think you're giving
me too much credit.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.843
It's what you crave, is it not?

19:19.890 --> 19:22.450
Acknowledgment
from a superior mind?

19:22.490 --> 19:24.856
Evidence that you matter?

19:24.890 --> 19:28.291
Why else pursue a partnership
with a man like Sherlock?

19:28.330 --> 19:30.798
Actually,
the partnership was his idea.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.762
That bothers you, doesn't it?

19:36.800 --> 19:40.475
I confess
to not understanding it.

19:40.510 --> 19:44.378
But... I'm drawn to things
I don't understand.

19:44.410 --> 19:47.277
Same as Sherlock.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.539
Once I've figured
you out, I'll move on.

19:52.420 --> 19:54.581
Same as Sherlock.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.222
Is that why
you've been writing him?

19:58.260 --> 20:01.423
Because you want
to... understand him?

20:03.270 --> 20:05.420
Part of it, I suppose.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.267
And the rest?

20:07.300 --> 20:10.463
What do you think?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.607
You think
you're in love with him.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.744
Only you can't be sure,

20:17.780 --> 20:20.476
because as much as you claim
to know about the world,

20:20.520 --> 20:21.942
love is something

20:21.980 --> 20:23.641
you don't quite get.

20:23.690 --> 20:28.286
You'd be surprised
what I'd do for love.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.787
Nothing crazy people do
surprises me.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.419
I write to Sherlock

20:33.460 --> 20:36.349
because he's the only person
on the planet

20:36.400 --> 20:39.324
I can really talk to.

20:39.370 --> 20:42.760
He writes to me because I'm
the only one he can talk to.

20:42.800 --> 20:48.432
The only one he can
ever truly relate to.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.744
If you still don't
understand that,

20:50.780 --> 20:53.340
you will someday.

20:53.380 --> 20:55.610
I promise.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.699
(door opening)

21:08.730 --> 21:12.427
(Holmes speaking French)

21:21.940 --> 21:24.044
What's with the...?

21:24.080 --> 21:25.502
Telephone?
I have felt compelled

21:25.550 --> 21:27.438
to hang up
on a good few many people today.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.313
I dug it out of the closet so I
could do it with more emphasis.

21:30.350 --> 21:33.683
Oh. And who was that you
were you just talking to?

21:33.720 --> 21:36.689
Old friend from Interpol.
Didn't sound like a friend.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.950
He, like many of the other
people I've spoken to today,

21:38.990 --> 21:40.855
was unable to confirm
that any of these men

21:40.900 --> 21:42.458
are who Moriarty
claims them to be.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.320
Devon Gaspar is a ghost.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.792
This is just busywork

21:45.830 --> 21:48.435
for us and the other agencies
investigating the kidnapping

21:48.470 --> 21:50.404
so that she has time
to plan her escape.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.568
Okay, so, let's move
off of these for a while.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.931
The captain said
that every officer in New York

21:55.980 --> 21:57.800
would get these via e-mail.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.875
They'll keep their eyes
peeled, you and I can go back

21:59.910 --> 22:01.673
over the evidence
from the abduction.

22:04.690 --> 22:08.615
Did you say everything
you wanted to say today?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.525
To Moriarty?

22:10.560 --> 22:12.619
That is why you accompanied her
to the Fuller residence,

22:12.660 --> 22:15.390
is it not? So you would have
a private dialogue with her?

22:15.430 --> 22:18.422
Well, you have been hogging her
for the last few months.

22:18.470 --> 22:19.869
I told you.
I have merely been...

22:19.900 --> 22:21.868
Studying her. Right.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.039
You have feelings for her,

22:24.070 --> 22:25.367
and that is
perfectly normal.
I have nothing of the sort.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.832
Irene was the love of your life.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.531
That is why,
in spite of everything,

22:28.580 --> 22:30.445
you can't quite give her up.
I get that.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.469
But I also know that you're only
gonna get hurt in the long run

22:34.520 --> 22:36.818
because _there is no_ Irene.
There is only Moriarty.

22:36.850 --> 22:40.718
And Moriarty is never
gonna change.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.019
(clears throat)

22:53.640 --> 22:55.892
(car door opens)
DISPATCHER:
3-1-David,

22:55.940 --> 22:59.603
3-1-David, you have
a 10-10 Disorderly Male,

22:59.640 --> 23:01.835
corner of 155th and Riverside.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.609
Suspect wearing a gray hoodie.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.005
Please check and advise.
Dispatch, this is 3-1-David.

23:06.050 --> 23:08.541
We're on our way.
(engine starts)

23:22.030 --> 23:25.898
(siren wails)

23:28.670 --> 23:32.003
(over P.A.):
Sir, how we doing today?

23:32.040 --> 23:34.838
(siren chirps)

23:38.050 --> 23:40.678
You're up.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.514
Excuse me.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.219
Buddy, how you doing?

23:49.260 --> 23:53.594
(silenced gunshots)

24:00.000 --> 24:01.467
This one's locked.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.604
Got another phone here.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.700
(grunts)

24:11.980 --> 24:13.618
There's a handsome devil.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.618
(gunshot)

24:15.650 --> 24:17.538
(silenced gunshot)

24:25.260 --> 24:26.955
(siren wailing in distance)

24:32.300 --> 24:34.837
GREGSON:
I'd say it's a pretty good
likeness, wouldn't you?

24:34.870 --> 24:36.838
I would.

24:36.870 --> 24:39.839
CSU said there
were two shooters,

24:39.870 --> 24:41.838
him and one
other guy.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.007
They led Molina and Kelty
into an ambush.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.676
You said Officer Molina's
cell phone was missmg.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.517
The second shooter took it.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.040
Why?

24:53.860 --> 24:58.524
All they had to do was lie low
until they got their money.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.723
Instead, two of them pop out
and shoot a couple of cops.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.092
If that makes any sense to you,
please tell me.

25:04.130 --> 25:07.099
'Cause it sure as hell
doesn't make any sense to me.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.535
I don't know.
I'm thinking

25:11.570 --> 25:13.208
maybe it's time that we
put those sketches out

25:13.240 --> 25:14.730
to the media.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.237
Can I see your cell phone?

25:32.330 --> 25:36.050
The FINEST message.
It goes to only policemen.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.658
That's what they wanted.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.793
That's why they ambushed
the officers.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.594
It was the only way they could
see Moriarty's sketches.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.232
Why would they want to see them?

25:44.270 --> 25:47.774
And how would they even know
they're out there?

25:47.810 --> 25:49.732
You sent a FINEST message,
Captain.

25:49.780 --> 25:52.271
Moriarty sent an even finer one.

25:55.850 --> 25:58.683
Robert Baden-Powell.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.915
Who's Robert
Baden-Powell?
Founder of the Scout Movement

26:00.960 --> 26:03.315
and Lieutenant General in the
British Army in the early 19005.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.726
He concocted a means
of concealing messages

26:05.760 --> 26:08.251
in entomological drawings
of leaves and butterflies.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.693
He called it "weaponization
of the pastoral."

26:12.730 --> 26:14.869
You weaponized your sketches,
didn't you?

26:14.900 --> 26:16.697
Hid information in them
for Devon Gaspar

26:16.740 --> 26:18.002
and the rest of your merry band.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.860
No, of course not.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.138
I've already started
to notice some quirks

26:21.180 --> 26:23.034
in some of the finer details.
The arrangement

26:23.080 --> 26:24.843
of Gaspar's stubble,
for example,

26:24.880 --> 26:26.347
is quite peculiar.
Or at least it is upon

26:26.380 --> 26:27.870
closer examination.
The length

26:27.920 --> 26:29.717
of the lines,
the spaces in between--

26:29.750 --> 26:32.878
they form a pattern.
Within the pattern, a message.

26:32.920 --> 26:36.708
You are behind the abduction
of Kayden Fuller.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.081
Sherlock...
You're responsible for what
happened to these policemen

26:39.130 --> 26:40.222
last night.

26:40.260 --> 26:40.999
No, I'm trying...

26:41.030 --> 26:43.351
Stop lying to me!

26:43.400 --> 26:46.096
I will decode these.
You know I will.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.735
So why don't you save us both
a lot of time and trouble

26:48.770 --> 26:51.034
and just tell me
your endgame, hmm? Who knows?

26:51.070 --> 26:52.765
You might even be able to trade
your cohorts' whereabouts

26:52.810 --> 26:55.005
for some more
prIVIleges.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.702
I can only imagine what you
would get for the safe return

26:57.750 --> 26:59.377
of Kayden Fuller.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.339
Devon Gaspar's on the line.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.812
He called
the front desk and asked

27:06.850 --> 27:08.010
to speak with us. Come on.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.152
(beep)

27:12.190 --> 27:14.420
This is Captain Gregson.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.758
Good to hear your voice,
Captain.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.428
I imagine, after yesterday's
unpleasantness,

27:19.470 --> 27:21.665
you're quite cross with me.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.964
But understand: it became
necessary when I realized

27:24.010 --> 27:28.003
you'd turned to our old friend
for assistance.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.837
GREGSON:
I'm sorry?

27:29.880 --> 27:31.199
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.842
We've been watching you.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.849
Your station.
We know she's there.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.019
It's why we set upon your men.

27:38.050 --> 27:42.453
To determine the degree
to which we'd been exposed.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.048
So. ..
now you know

27:44.090 --> 27:46.058
what we know.

27:46.090 --> 27:50.459
Then I guess you won't mind
ifI start calling you Devon?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.923
A good a name as any.

27:52.970 --> 27:54.995
But your knowing it won't stop
me and my colleagues

27:55.040 --> 27:56.792
from disappearing tomorrow.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.728
I don't care where you go,
Devon.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.806
I just want
the little girl back.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.879
Oh, she's the other reason
why we called.

28:04.910 --> 28:09.813
She has been asking to speak
with her mummy.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.841
Begging,
really.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.778
Well, Mrs. Fuller
isn't here with us, but

28:13.820 --> 28:14.957
bear with us. I'm sure we can...

28:14.990 --> 28:16.287
Mommy,

28:16.320 --> 28:17.821
I miss you.

28:17.860 --> 28:20.078
I'm afraid. I want to come home.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.826
Plea...
Hope you got all that.

28:22.860 --> 28:27.320
And I hope there won't be any
surprises awaiting us tomorrow.

28:27.370 --> 28:30.339
Until then.
(dial tone)

28:30.370 --> 28:33.407
I don't care what she's promised
your government.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.136
Her time_as a
consultant is over.

28:36.180 --> 28:37.374
You heard him.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.885
(door shuts)

28:50.190 --> 28:51.987
(sighs)

28:52.030 --> 28:55.193
Okay, so,
if your answer key is right,

28:55.230 --> 28:56.993
then all Moriarty tried
to pass along in these sketches

28:57.030 --> 29:00.067
is a bunch
of numbers.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.037
GPS coordinates?

29:08.080 --> 29:11.868
Yeah. For...

29:11.910 --> 29:13.878
a location

29:13.920 --> 29:17.242
in the heart of... Svalbard,

29:17.280 --> 29:19.885
which is a remote island off
the northern coast of Norway.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.117
Well, you thought all along this
was about Moriarty escaping.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.787
Maybe that's
where Gaspar and his team

29:24.830 --> 29:26.786
are supposed
to take her.
A fine hypothesis.

29:26.830 --> 29:29.822
If indeed escape
is still in her agenda.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.294
You don't think it is anymore?
The woman is a riddle
wrapped in a mystery

29:32.330 --> 29:34.139
inside an enigma
I've had sex with.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.365
I would be lying ifI said
I was the strongest assessor

29:36.400 --> 29:37.469
of her motives at this point.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.470
Are you expecting someone?

29:43.510 --> 29:44.807
Paperboy.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.977
It's almost 9:00 at night.

29:47.010 --> 29:49.046
I've asked him to gather me hard
copies of The New York Ledger.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.389
Anything and everything
from the last two weeks.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.944
Why?
Because

29:52.990 --> 29:54.855
it is the only newspaper
Moriarty had access to

29:54.890 --> 29:57.313
during her so-called
"incarceration."

29:57.360 --> 29:59.954
I strongly suspect the
communication between Moriarty

29:59.990 --> 30:01.491
and Gaspar has been two-way.

30:01.530 --> 30:04.090
Prior to her generating the
sketches, she had no way to send

30:04.130 --> 30:05.119
a coded message
from custody.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.967
But she could have received one

30:07.000 --> 30:08.592
via advert in the paper's
classified section.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.096
(phone chimes)

30:10.140 --> 30:13.132
Pillock. He left them
by the kitchen door.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.149
(dog barking in distance)

30:25.150 --> 30:27.618
Did you see Moriarty
today when...

30:27.650 --> 30:30.881
Gaspar put Kayden Fuller
on the phone?

30:30.930 --> 30:33.990
She seemed angry.

30:34.030 --> 30:35.895
I had just determined
that she sent Gaspar a message

30:35.930 --> 30:36.954
via the sketches.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.524
Well, I've seen
that look before.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.060
I've been on the receiving end.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.931
Looked like she wanted
to kill the guy.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.132
Well, you're up late.

30:46.170 --> 30:47.979
Rather hard to relax

30:48.010 --> 30:50.501
now that you're keeping
these bracelets on me here.

30:50.540 --> 30:55.045
Heaven forfend I trigger them in
my sleep and electrocute myself.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.014
If you hadn't pulled
that trick with the sketches,

30:57.050 --> 30:59.439
we wouldn't have
to take extra precautions.

30:59.490 --> 31:03.449
Ah. So you think
Sherlock was right.

31:03.490 --> 31:06.129
I sent the originals to the NSA.
It only took them a few hours

31:06.160 --> 31:10.119
to find those numbers you'd hid.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.594
I've been thinking about
what you said the other day.

31:12.630 --> 31:15.633
About... feelings
I might still have

31:15.670 --> 31:17.069
for her.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.965
You were right,
as you so often are

31:19.010 --> 31:21.035
in such matters.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.106
Despite everything, I do
continue to feel a certain...

31:24.150 --> 31:26.402
pull.

31:26.450 --> 31:28.418
In my weaker moments,

31:28.450 --> 31:31.010
I've entertained the notion
that she might be able to...

31:31.050 --> 31:32.642
change. I suppose
because I've undergone

31:32.690 --> 31:34.487
a transformation of my own.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.114
I was, until as recently
as two years ago,

31:37.160 --> 31:39.549
a drug-addled misanthrope.
Today, I'm sober.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.626
I've cultivated not one
but several

31:41.660 --> 31:44.322
meaningful
relationships.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.021
The woman has never been
anything less than obsessed

31:47.070 --> 31:50.062
with our many similarities.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.307
I suppose I thought...

31:52.340 --> 31:55.639
she could undergo a
metamorphosis of her own.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.945
Would it surprise you to learn
that during the course

31:58.980 --> 32:00.242
of my internment here,

32:00.280 --> 32:04.182
I have devised exactly
17 means of escaping?

32:04.220 --> 32:09.055
Six of which can_ account for
the extra precautions like my...

32:09.090 --> 32:10.387
bracelets.

32:10.420 --> 32:13.389
I can only come up with ten.

32:15.430 --> 32:17.227
You see something?

32:17.260 --> 32:21.060
To the naked eye, it is
an advert for a used car.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.591
But there are indicators
of an Ave Maria

32:23.640 --> 32:26.234
cipher.
It's a cryptographical technique

32:26.270 --> 32:29.034
devised by a priest named
Johannes Trithemius

32:29.080 --> 32:31.344
in the fif...

32:31.380 --> 32:33.940
What is it?

32:35.250 --> 32:37.741
I was wrong.

32:37.780 --> 32:40.578
Moriarty is not the architect
of the plot

32:40.620 --> 32:43.680
to kidnap Kayden Fuller.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.257
She's one of its victims.

32:46.290 --> 32:49.293
Did you know that glass
is a very poor conductor

32:49.330 --> 32:51.218
of electricity? It's often used

32:51.270 --> 32:53.124
to insulate power lines.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.632
are glass.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.729
All I'd have
to do is

33:01.780 --> 33:04.146
break one, jam the shards

33:04.180 --> 33:07.206
between my wrists and the
electrodes on the restraints.

33:07.250 --> 33:09.218
I'd probably cut
myself quite badly,

33:09.250 --> 33:13.084
but my bracelets
would be neutralized.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.315
(gasping and groaning)

33:19.060 --> 33:21.096
Gaspar set
this entire affair in motion

33:21.130 --> 33:22.620
with a coded message
to Moriarty.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.069
"You know what I want.
Tell me where it is."

33:27.100 --> 33:28.658
The coordinates.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.498
So, whatever Kaspar's after,
it's hidden in Svalbard.

33:31.540 --> 33:34.100
Exactly. $50 million ransom
is just a fig leaf.

33:34.140 --> 33:36.233
Although, I'm sure he'll be
happy enough to have that.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.679
His actual quarry is whatever

33:37.710 --> 33:39.371
Moriarty has directed him
towards.

33:39.410 --> 33:42.049
You said Moriarty was a victim.
What did you mean by that?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.547
The final part of his message.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.582
"Be prompt. Your daughter's life
hangs in the balance."

33:48.260 --> 33:51.229
Kayden Fuller
is Moriarty's daughter?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.468
DEVON:
28 hand.

34:01.500 --> 34:05.163
Well done.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.461
Go ahead.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.102
Take Fourth Street.

34:12.450 --> 34:15.146
Cutthroat rules suit you, I see.

34:15.180 --> 34:18.616
(two gunshots)

34:18.650 --> 34:20.481
Get under the bed.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.080
Don't open the door for anyone.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.554
Go.

34:34.470 --> 34:36.358
(man crying)

34:37.600 --> 34:39.704
(man sobbing)

34:39.740 --> 34:42.573
Oh, no, no.

34:42.610 --> 34:44.703
(crying)
No.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.342
Clay?

34:46.380 --> 34:48.109
(crying)

34:48.150 --> 34:53.588
(sobbing)

34:53.620 --> 34:56.555
I'm sorry.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.421
I'm sorry. She...

34:58.460 --> 35:01.122
She told me
to shoot him.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.128
She?

35:03.160 --> 35:05.219
She knows things.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.137
I've got family, too.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.331
I don't want her coming for 'em.

35:10.370 --> 35:11.598
(gunshots)

35:11.640 --> 35:14.507
(grunting)

35:17.640 --> 35:19.608
How'd you find us?

35:19.650 --> 35:22.175
I know the properties we hold.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.586
I know you need to house
and feed a seven-year-old.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.383
That takes space.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.183
I know that when
Montgomery was killed

35:28.220 --> 35:29.619
while you ambushed
those police,

35:29.660 --> 35:31.321
they found clay subsoil
on his boots.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.759
Just like the kind we found

35:32.790 --> 35:34.496
seeping
into the foundations here.

35:34.530 --> 35:36.896
(panﬁng)

35:38.330 --> 35:39.922
The girl's safe.

35:39.970 --> 35:42.359
(panﬁng)

35:42.400 --> 35:43.594
(pained groan)

35:43.640 --> 35:45.505
Get on with it, would you?

35:45.540 --> 35:48.179
Or do you plan
to let me bleed out?

35:48.210 --> 35:51.941
Oh, I'm afraid I've got
something a little less passive

35:51.980 --> 35:54.574
in mind for you.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.941
GREGSON:
Believe it or not,

35:57.980 --> 35:59.709
most of this blood
is Moriarty's.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.388
She shorted out her bracelets,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.559
dug these implants
they gave her out of her,

36:03.590 --> 36:04.818
and somehow used
Mattoo's handprint

36:04.860 --> 36:06.487
to get herself
out of here.

36:06.530 --> 36:08.418
And what about Mattoo?

36:08.460 --> 36:10.553
He's in bad shape-- stable-- but
they think he's gonna make it.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.862
So, she didn't kill him?

36:11.900 --> 36:13.629
She didn't kill anybody
on her way out of here.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.592
Mattoo's the only one
she even confronted.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.289
There's quite a bit
of blood here.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.705
She'll need medical attention.

36:18.740 --> 36:20.469
We checked the hospitals.
There's nothing.

36:20.510 --> 36:22.671
She's got a 40-minute
head start on us.

36:22.710 --> 36:25.247
Any ideas?

36:25.280 --> 36:27.407
She's gone to
fetch her daughter.

36:27.450 --> 36:29.645
(phone ringing)

36:31.790 --> 36:33.712
This is Sherlock Holmes.

36:33.750 --> 36:36.719
MORIARTY:
I'd like to see you.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.728
Tell me where you are,
and I'll come.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.797
The Bronx. A condemned building
near Van Cortlandt Park.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.422
Top floor.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.724
Tell the police
they can wait outside.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.591
You're the only one
who can come in.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.871
(door squeaks open)

37:21.400 --> 37:23.436
Your daughter?

37:23.470 --> 37:26.735
Sent away, resituated.

37:26.770 --> 37:30.604
You've done the
maths, I assume.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.700
She was born
well before I met you.

37:33.750 --> 37:37.311
An indiscretion
at the start of my career.

37:37.350 --> 37:39.580
Even as I carried
her to term,

37:39.620 --> 37:42.487
I knew that motherhood
would not mix well with my...

37:42.520 --> 37:44.727
proclivities.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.887
Some sources of mine told me

37:46.930 --> 37:48.852
that the Fullers
were having trouble

37:48.900 --> 37:51.460
conceiving a child of their own.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.333
It wasn't hard
to arrange a match.

37:54.370 --> 37:56.691
How did Gaspar learn of her?

37:56.740 --> 37:59.436
No idea.

37:59.470 --> 38:03.600
I assume the girl's real father
needs a lesson in discretion.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.997
What's on the island
of Svalbard?

38:25.730 --> 38:29.029
The coordinates I gave Devon are
the location of a vault.

38:29.070 --> 38:32.403
Copies of all the seeds
on the planet are stored inside,

38:32.440 --> 38:34.977
in the event that the earth's
flora needs to be restored

38:35.010 --> 38:38.548
after a catastrophe.

38:38.580 --> 38:42.072
But that's not what Gaspar
expected to find there.

38:44.020 --> 38:46.580
I maintain...

38:46.620 --> 38:49.680
a dossier of interesting facts.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.553
I assembled most of them myself.

38:52.590 --> 38:54.899
Some were passed down to me
by a mentor

38:54.930 --> 38:58.991
who shared theI sdame enthusiasms
o.

38:59.030 --> 39:02.989
Even ifI directed Devon
to the right place,

39:03.040 --> 39:05.065
he hadn't the wit to
use my book properly.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.908
So, you sent him hunting
above the Arctic Circle,

39:07.940 --> 39:10.977
just so you would have time
to move against him.

39:11.010 --> 39:12.944
It was a risk,
but I've always been willing

39:12.980 --> 39:14.516
to bet on my abilities.

39:14.550 --> 39:16.848
And in this
instance,

39:16.880 --> 39:19.610
I had the added benefit
of assistance

39:19.650 --> 39:21.880
from the keenest mind
I've ever met.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.779
All's well that ends well,
right?

39:44.140 --> 39:46.745
You need an ambulance.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.171
You could have run.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.848
And live as a
fugitive? Why?

39:54.760 --> 39:58.821
The world's corruption runs
deeper than even you know.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.420
No need to skulk about.

40:01.460 --> 40:04.566
I'll be a free woman
soon enough.

40:08.170 --> 40:12.834
Your letters have meant
a great deal to me.

40:14.740 --> 40:17.174
I find them
influencing my decisions

40:17.210 --> 40:19.906
in the most surprising ways.

40:22.550 --> 40:25.917
You could have killed
Agent Mattoo.

40:27.190 --> 40:29.215
And from your perspective,

40:29.260 --> 40:32.457
it would have been
the expedient thing.

40:32.490 --> 40:36.028
And yet, to you, it
would have been repugnant.

40:37.800 --> 40:41.190
Tell me, is that how you
learned to be one of them?

40:41.230 --> 40:43.994
By learning to care

40:44.040 --> 40:47.737
how your actions seemed
in the eyes of another?

40:49.810 --> 40:52.745
I'm not sure I am one of them.

41:03.990 --> 41:05.878
(Moriarty groans softly)

41:05.930 --> 41:07.682
(garbled radio transmission)

41:09.860 --> 41:12.021
She needs a hospital.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.958
(helicopter whirring)

41:22.080 --> 41:25.208
(siren blaring)

41:29.850 --> 41:32.045
*

41:44.060 --> 41:46.597
I just got
off the phone

41:46.630 --> 41:47.892
with Captain Gregson.

41:47.930 --> 41:50.535
She lost a lot of blood,
but she's gonna make it.

41:54.910 --> 41:57.299
You all right?

41:57.340 --> 41:59.945
I am. Thank you.

42:26.370 --> 42:28.975
