I'll come down and cover the desk.

Leave your name and number,

01:06.958 --> 01:11.000
Detective, uh… [sniffles]
This is Andrea Bowen again.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.416
Sorry. Uh…

01:13.000 --> 01:15.666
I know it's late,
but could you call me back when you can?

01:15.750 --> 01:16.666
I-- [shudders]

01:16.750 --> 01:18.041
I'd really appreciate it.

01:18.875 --> 01:21.000
[shakily] I'm just really scared,
and I just…

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I feel like he's still watching me.

-[music continues over speakers]
-[woman] Hi, sorry.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.083
I had a bottle of wine, but I drank it,

03:51.166 --> 03:54.166
so I brought you this plant,
which I'm now noticing is dead.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.291
-I called you five times.
-What's wrong?

03:56.375 --> 03:58.916
Jenn, Brian's here.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.041
I know, I'm sorry. It's just--

04:01.125 --> 04:03.958
Originally, you weren't coming,
and then Scott invited him,

04:04.041 --> 04:06.500
and I had absolutely no idea. So…

04:07.000 --> 04:08.583
Yeah, I could just…

04:09.291 --> 04:11.708
tell everyone you're not feeling well,
you know?

04:13.625 --> 04:15.291
I think I need a glass of wine.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.666
Hey, Jenn!

04:34.750 --> 04:35.958
Hey, Scotty.

04:36.041 --> 04:38.083
Hey, I am so sorry.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.250
Yes, yes, he is.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.125
-You don't have to apologize.
-He does.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.666
She told me a week ago
that you weren't coming.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.041
-It's her fault.
-Okay. Stop.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.583
You don't know what's happening,
so walk away.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.958
-Okay, that's really cute.
-I love you. [chuckles]

04:50.625 --> 04:52.083
[woman] Oh, it's Dr. Meade!

04:52.791 --> 04:54.541
[chuckling] Hi. Dr. Meade.

04:54.625 --> 04:55.458
Hi.

04:55.541 --> 04:58.750
This is Jenn. As in, "The Jenn."

04:58.833 --> 05:01.583
-Yes. I'm "The Jenn," apparently.
-[Meade] Ah!

05:01.666 --> 05:05.708
-Collin Meade. Very nice to meet you.
-[woman] He's magical. Changed my life.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.916
I got the promotion, like,
a month after working with you?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.125
And this house.
You should totally go see him.

05:13.291 --> 05:14.208
Wow.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.208
What? Everyone needs therapy.

05:16.291 --> 05:19.166
-That's what you say, right?
-You know where the ice tongs are?

05:19.250 --> 05:22.291
-It's by the ice bucket, Scott.
-[Scott] They're not there.

05:22.375 --> 05:25.791
Babe. Seriously, every time!
I put them beside the ice thing.

05:25.875 --> 05:28.500
It's not every time. [continues inaudibly]

05:29.333 --> 05:30.375
[both chuckle]

05:31.791 --> 05:34.166
Didn't know therapists
could hang out with their clients.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.916
I mean,
I follow the rules 99% of the time.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.541
Maybe 95?

05:41.083 --> 05:42.916
[Jenn chuckles]

05:46.916 --> 05:47.750
Um…

05:49.333 --> 05:51.083
It was nice meeting you.

05:58.708 --> 06:01.458
-Cheers to your new house.
-My new house!

06:02.833 --> 06:05.625
So, Brian, how's Foghorn?

06:05.708 --> 06:06.833
What's Foghorn?

06:07.333 --> 06:10.208
-It's a stupid name, is what it is.
-No, what is it?

06:10.791 --> 06:15.125
Uh, the guys created a new software
for some big audio engineer.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.083
I just helped write some of the code.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.708
What about you, Jennifer?

06:19.416 --> 06:20.666
Oh, sorry. What?

06:20.750 --> 06:23.041
Oh, no. I was just, uh--

06:24.041 --> 06:25.333
What do you do?

06:26.625 --> 06:30.041
I'm just-- Um, I'm sort of
in between jobs at the moment.

06:30.125 --> 06:34.541
She's just being modest. Jenny is actually
a killer software engineer.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.500
-Impressive.
-[Jenn] Mm-hmm.

06:36.583 --> 06:39.541
-So, you two ever worked together?
-Brian!

06:40.416 --> 06:42.750
Um… Is there sesame in that?

06:42.833 --> 06:45.875
[gasps] Oh my God! Brian, I'm so sorry.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.375
[Brian] It's okay. It's okay.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.416
Wow, that would've sucked
if you died in our new house, dude.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.458
[Brian chuckles]

06:54.541 --> 06:58.250
You know what?
I think I'm gonna leave this right here.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.041
Just in case. [chuckles]

07:00.625 --> 07:02.708
-[mouthing] You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good.

07:02.791 --> 07:05.791
[ballad playing over speakers]

07:10.166 --> 07:12.958
-Jennifer.
-Hm. Yes?

07:14.208 --> 07:16.833
I'm headed out, but, uh,
I wanted to leave you this.

07:17.416 --> 07:20.000
-In case you're interested.
-Okay.

07:22.250 --> 07:23.250
Good night.

07:24.875 --> 07:25.833
You too.

07:33.833 --> 07:37.458
Yeah.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.958
Thanks for saving my life.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.250
Don't mention it.

07:48.666 --> 07:49.625
Good night, Jenny.

07:50.625 --> 07:51.500
Good night.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.375
Jenny?

07:58.666 --> 07:59.500
Yeah?

08:00.208 --> 08:03.541
I have tried really hard
not to bother you, but…

08:04.916 --> 08:06.958
I think about you all the time,
and I just--

08:10.208 --> 08:11.500
I miss you.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.750
[evocative music]

08:14.458 --> 08:17.041
I didn't ask you to stay away
because you bother me.

08:18.041 --> 08:18.958
Yeah. I know--

08:19.041 --> 08:20.916
Then don't say things like that.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.083
When you say things like that,
you make me sound like the bad guy,

08:25.166 --> 08:27.083
and I'm not the bad guy. I'm--

08:28.083 --> 08:30.208
You're not the bad guy.
I'm not saying you are.

08:30.291 --> 08:34.208
I'm just-- Oh God, what am I saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.750
[Jenn sighs]

08:39.625 --> 08:41.083
Can I give you a ride home?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.333
-I don't think that's a good id--
-[Brian] It's just a ride, Jenny.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.083
[birds calling]

09:02.291 --> 09:03.583
[woman] You guys had sex?

09:04.083 --> 09:07.125
-Do you plan on getting back together?
-No.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.916
I'm stupid. Oh God, I'm the most stupid.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.666
Oh my gosh, you're not. You're not stupid.
You're just-- You're--

09:15.750 --> 09:18.250
-You're unhappy.
-Yeah, everyone's unhappy.

09:18.958 --> 09:22.458
No. I'm happy. Scott's happy.

09:22.541 --> 09:25.375
And for the most part,
I hate to say this to you,

09:25.458 --> 09:28.250
but Brian is happy.

09:28.958 --> 09:30.833
What am I supposed to say to that?

09:30.916 --> 09:34.041
[clicks tongue]
I think you should see Dr. Meade.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.541
-Who's Dr. Meade?
-My therapist.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.333
-Gina, I'll never do that.
-You met him. He's tall, handsome.

09:39.416 --> 09:40.250
-No.
-Come on.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.625
Hear me out, okay?
You're isolating. You're unemployed.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.458
Don't pretend like you're not.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.583
And you slept
with your ex-fiancé last night.

09:47.666 --> 09:50.916
-Your life is a vortex of crap right now.
-This is so much fun.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.875
Can you just go for me, please?

09:54.916 --> 09:56.708
-Ugh, fine. Once.
-Great!

09:56.791 --> 09:58.708
I made you an appointment for Friday.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.083
[soft brooding music]

10:36.208 --> 10:37.375
[button clicks]

10:58.708 --> 11:01.166
You should've seen me
when I started with him.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.375
Oh, sorry?

11:02.458 --> 11:04.208
I pull my hair.

11:04.791 --> 11:05.833
OCD.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.208
Oh.

11:08.041 --> 11:11.583
Whatever you're here for,
Dr. Meade will fix it.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.041
Yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.375
He's waiting for you.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.250
Oh, okay. Um, yeah.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.875
[water sloshing]

11:25.875 --> 11:28.791
Wow, this is cozy.

11:28.875 --> 11:29.958
Jennifer.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.666
[chuckles] Just feeding the little guy.

11:33.458 --> 11:37.458
You know that having fish
reduces stress and lowers blood pressure?

11:38.041 --> 11:39.500
[Jenn] No, I didn't.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.000
At least that's what I've heard.
Who knows if it's true.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.750
But I do find them calming.

11:46.541 --> 11:48.166
I'm so glad you decided to come in.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.041
And here I am!

11:50.708 --> 11:51.666
Please.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.333
[thumps]

12:00.416 --> 12:03.708
[Jenn] I don't feel motivated
to do anything.

12:03.791 --> 12:07.166
Or, like, I should probably stop drinking.
I should probably exercise more.

12:07.250 --> 12:10.375
I should probably
get eight hours of sleep at night.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.250
Jennifer, um,

12:13.750 --> 12:16.958
bad habits come from deeper issues.

12:17.541 --> 12:19.791
There's always a root cause.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.666
What might that be for you?

12:23.916 --> 12:24.750
I don't know?

12:24.833 --> 12:26.166
Was that a question?

12:26.250 --> 12:27.333
Yes?

12:29.166 --> 12:30.458
Tell me about you and Brian.

12:33.750 --> 12:38.291
He's nice. He's sweet, he's funny,
he's smart. It's Brian. I don't know.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.541
[inhales deeply]

12:43.625 --> 12:46.291
[exhales] Okay. Fine. Um…

12:47.250 --> 12:48.916
We met in college.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.166
We lived together. We worked together.
It was like a whole thing.

12:53.958 --> 12:55.958
[gloomy music]

12:56.916 --> 12:58.333
I had a miscarriage.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.000
Actually, I was six months along,
so it was a stillbirth.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.250
[gloomy music builds]

13:09.333 --> 13:10.875
His name was Daniel.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.083
I got to spend 33 minutes with him.

13:23.416 --> 13:25.958
Brian and I were engaged, and, uh,

13:26.666 --> 13:29.458
you know, we just couldn't
really figure it out after that. So…

13:31.666 --> 13:33.083
[inhales]

13:36.750 --> 13:38.958
Do you have anything after this?

13:41.666 --> 13:42.500
No.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.583
Have you ever tried hypnotherapy?

13:46.916 --> 13:49.208
[chuckles] No. No, I have not.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.125
Why the judgment?

13:51.625 --> 13:55.291
I'm just not a giving-away-control person,

13:55.375 --> 13:57.000
so it's a pass.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.916
Sure. But here's the wonderful thing
about hypnotherapy. All right?

14:01.916 --> 14:04.500
Only you can control your subconscious.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.583
-[Jenn sighs]
-So, you're in control the whole time.

14:10.375 --> 14:13.500
And it's an excellent tool
for people who have suffered…

14:14.833 --> 14:15.666
trauma.

14:17.916 --> 14:22.375
Worst case scenario, it'll stop you
from further destroying your poor fingers.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.166
[sighs] I don't know.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.666
I had a mentor,

14:31.416 --> 14:34.916
and his name was, uh, Dr. Xavier Sullivan.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.250
He was a brilliant mind. He would say,

14:37.875 --> 14:41.000
"Prosaic methods are reserved
for the unimaginative."

14:41.750 --> 14:46.541
"One in search of lasting results
dares to open the mind."

14:47.458 --> 14:48.375
[Jenn] Hm.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.125
-[Meade] Jennifer?
-[Jenn exhales]

14:52.541 --> 14:53.791
What do you want?

14:56.208 --> 14:59.333
Just wanna be happy again, you know?

15:07.541 --> 15:09.000
Then let me help you.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.625
I want you to concentrate on the light.

15:14.708 --> 15:16.791
[lights droning]

15:16.875 --> 15:21.333
[Meade] Feel the weight of your body
as it melts into the couch,

15:22.500 --> 15:23.583
muscle by muscle.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.500
Starting at the toes,

15:28.791 --> 15:30.333
the arches of the feet.

15:30.416 --> 15:31.541
[droning intensifies]

15:31.625 --> 15:34.625
[Meade] Calves. Thighs.

15:35.666 --> 15:36.833
All the way up,

15:37.541 --> 15:41.125
until you arrive at the top of your head.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.041
Now,

15:44.416 --> 15:46.125
I want you to find yourself

15:47.416 --> 15:49.166
in a beautiful forest.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.125
[loud droning continues]

15:53.666 --> 15:55.583
[birds calling]

15:57.250 --> 15:59.250
[droning stops]

16:00.041 --> 16:02.041
[roller shades whir]

16:19.166 --> 16:20.041
That was an hour?

16:22.041 --> 16:23.458
It felt like three minutes.

16:24.666 --> 16:25.666
How do you feel?

16:26.166 --> 16:29.375
[sighs] I don't know.
I don't really remember anything.

16:30.583 --> 16:31.541
How'd I do?

16:32.541 --> 16:35.458
I think you might be
more open to suggestibility

16:36.250 --> 16:37.416
than you imagined.

16:38.958 --> 16:39.958
[chuckles]

16:40.041 --> 16:42.000
[tranquil music]

16:46.833 --> 16:48.833

-[elevator dings]

16:55.916 --> 16:58.916
[phone chiming]

17:04.666 --> 17:05.708
[Jenn] That was bizarre.

17:06.500 --> 17:10.375
They called me right after I left.
I start in two weeks.

17:11.166 --> 17:14.208
Are you gonna do some yoga with me,
or you're just gonna lie there?

17:14.291 --> 17:15.958
This is Shavasana. It is yoga.

17:16.541 --> 17:17.958
[sighs]

17:18.041 --> 17:20.125
How many sessions did you have
with Dr. Meade?

17:20.208 --> 17:24.333
I don't know. Maybe, um, once a week
for about three months now.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.833
I've asked him to do hypnosis twice.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.416
It's not fair.
I wanna conquer all of my fears.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.000
It's a compliment.
You've already conquered all your fears.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.541
Hi, have you seen me and spiders?
Didn't think so.

17:36.958 --> 17:38.166
I'm really proud of you.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
[ominous music]

17:51.458 --> 17:53.458
-[birds calling]
-[wind gusting]

18:17.041 --> 18:18.375
[whispers] You're perfect.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
[light gasp]

18:27.375 --> 18:29.375
[indistinct chatter]

18:30.041 --> 18:32.041
[pop music playing over speakers]

18:36.416 --> 18:38.416
[woman chuckles]

18:48.625 --> 18:49.625
Jennifer?

18:51.041 --> 18:53.000
-Hi.
-[chuckling] Hi.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.416
-You look fantastic as ever.
-Oh, thanks. You too.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Haven't seen you in a couple of weeks.
You're not, uh… you're not avoiding me?

19:00.083 --> 19:03.416
Oh, no. I've been meaning to schedule.
It's just I've been busy--

19:03.500 --> 19:04.958
-Sure.
-Oh…

19:05.750 --> 19:06.791
I got the job.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.541
-What? Really?
-Yeah, I did.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.916
-I had no doubt.
-You didn't think I could do it?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.375
No. I never doubted you.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.041
[both laugh]

19:16.041 --> 19:18.833
May I buy you a celebratory coffee?

19:21.791 --> 19:22.708
Yeah, okay.

19:22.791 --> 19:23.875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

19:25.458 --> 19:30.041
I did yoga with Gina,
and I meditated last night.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.000
Amazing.

19:31.083 --> 19:34.666
It was three minutes, and I thought
about my dead plants, but I did it.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.500
-Progress. Not perfection.
-You can't say that.

19:37.583 --> 19:40.000
You're one of those people
that wakes up at 5:00 a.m.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.083
-and you're perfect at everything.
-Hardly.

19:42.166 --> 19:45.666
And one of those who hangs out
with his clients but is very private.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.125
[chuckles]

19:49.250 --> 19:51.250
[smooth jazz playing over speakers]

19:51.916 --> 19:52.875
All right.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.041
I'll play.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.416
I'm 46. Only child. [clicks tongue]

20:00.500 --> 20:06.125
Uh, I was married once
to the love of my life, Amy.

20:07.458 --> 20:11.125
We were happy, but she died.

20:11.666 --> 20:13.333
I'm so sorry.

20:13.416 --> 20:14.958
What do they say?

20:15.041 --> 20:17.125
"Wanna make God laugh,
tell him your plans."

20:18.583 --> 20:21.166
But, Jennifer,
the important thing to remember

20:21.250 --> 20:23.375
is that being a victim is a choice,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.583
and we can let our hardships define us,

20:27.083 --> 20:30.333
consume us, or we can accept

20:30.416 --> 20:34.125
the extraordinary abilities
that we have in this life

20:35.208 --> 20:37.250
to create the outcome we choose.

20:38.583 --> 20:40.833
-For ourselves. May I?
-Mm.

20:40.916 --> 20:43.916
[tense music]

20:46.416 --> 20:47.291
[chuckling] Eyelash.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.750
-[smooth jazz continues over speakers]
-Thank you.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.125
All right, well, enough about me. Um…

20:52.208 --> 20:55.000
So, last we spoke,
you were struggling a bit with Brian.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.166
How's it going there?

20:56.791 --> 20:58.791
I don't know. I have been avoiding him.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.791
When you see Brian, uh,

21:03.541 --> 21:05.041
is it hard for you?

21:05.958 --> 21:07.041
Yeah.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.625
Have you considered telling him this?

21:12.291 --> 21:13.208
And if you did?

21:15.083 --> 21:18.416
He may be hurt because we still care
about each other a lot.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.416
Let me suggest something,
and you can take it or leave it,

21:23.500 --> 21:26.208
but I think you'd be wise to take it.
[chuckles]

21:26.291 --> 21:27.333
Okay.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.958
Invite Brian to your place
for dinner tonight.

21:30.041 --> 21:31.791
-No.
-[Meade] Why not?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.791
I can think of infinite reasons why not.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.125
Trust me. You'll be on your turf.
You can cook a good meal.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.833
Tell him you got
some matters you need to discuss.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.750
I think it'd be very good for you.

21:43.333 --> 21:46.791
But not easy.
I mean, I'm not saying that. But--

21:47.416 --> 21:48.333
But good.

21:50.708 --> 21:51.708
'Cause, Jennifer,

21:53.375 --> 21:55.291
you don't have to be a victim anymore.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.000
[phone chimes]

22:07.291 --> 22:09.958
[Brian] Hey, it's Brian.
I got your message.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.833
Yeah, uh, I'll be there.

22:12.375 --> 22:15.291
Let me know if you want me
to bring anything. See you soon.

22:16.291 --> 22:19.166
[phone chiming]

22:22.291 --> 22:23.166

23:28.875 --> 23:29.750
Where's your pen?

23:31.208 --> 23:32.333
Where's your--

23:33.166 --> 23:34.291
[pen clicks]

23:34.375 --> 23:36.375
[siren wailing]

23:41.375 --> 23:44.208
[monitor beeping]

23:55.875 --> 23:56.750
[Gina] Hey.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.750
[siren wailing]

24:04.916 --> 24:06.750
It was an accident, Jenn.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.125
I mean, I almost killed him
at our housewarming party.

24:11.208 --> 24:12.666
You're the one who caught it.

24:13.875 --> 24:15.500
I can't remember anything.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.791
-You're probably just in shock.
-No, I'm not in shock.

24:20.291 --> 24:21.625
I'm serious. I--

24:24.250 --> 24:26.000
I remember being at the store.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.500
And then I'm at home sitting at the table.

24:33.625 --> 24:37.458
Come on. I'm gonna--
I'm gonna take you home.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.291
[Meade] How's Brian?

24:48.541 --> 24:49.458
Sorry?

24:51.875 --> 24:53.375
Brian. How is he?

24:54.125 --> 24:55.333
He's the same.

24:57.666 --> 25:00.000
-[Meade] How long has it been now?
-Eight days.

25:04.291 --> 25:05.375
[Meade inhales]

25:05.458 --> 25:08.041
Do you remember
anything else from that night?

25:11.750 --> 25:14.416
Is there any way
that I could be responsible

25:14.500 --> 25:16.250
for what happened that night?

25:17.791 --> 25:19.083
[Meade] Why do you ask?

25:19.625 --> 25:21.666
Because I can't stop thinking about it.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.416
The way it felt,

25:25.375 --> 25:26.916
and the missing time.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.458
It's like what we do here.

25:29.541 --> 25:30.750
[Meade] Hm.

25:31.666 --> 25:36.083
[inhales] Do you remember what I told you
the first time we discussed hypnosis?

25:36.166 --> 25:41.166
That only you have the power,
control over your subconscious.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.166
-Yeah, but--
-[Meade] Jennifer, listen to me.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.125
We all have these wounds,

25:51.041 --> 25:55.750
and every time we let the world run us,
those wounds fester.

25:56.625 --> 26:01.708
But that's a choice
based on some preconceived notion

26:01.791 --> 26:05.458
that the world
can even run us in the first place.

26:06.791 --> 26:07.791
It's ego.

26:09.208 --> 26:11.833
Ego derived from fear.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.416
You follow?

26:15.375 --> 26:20.041
So, the work we're doing
is designed to eliminate that fear,

26:20.750 --> 26:23.791
but the moment
you start to doubt our work,

26:24.375 --> 26:25.208
fear wins.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.416
Is that what you want?

26:29.166 --> 26:30.416
To let fear win?

26:32.541 --> 26:33.375
No.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.083
So you need to trust me…

26:39.083 --> 26:40.416
and keep doing the work.

Hello?

28:00.166 --> 28:01.458
[Meade] Jennifer,

28:02.416 --> 28:03.375
carry the fire.

28:36.958 --> 28:38.958
[adventurous music]

28:42.958 --> 28:45.541
[newswoman]
This is a terrible turn of events,

28:45.625 --> 28:48.416
as the family is reeling
after losing their daughter,

28:48.500 --> 28:50.500
and they still have no information
from police.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.958
[newsman] …and in Portland,
there's an investigation

28:53.041 --> 28:55.291
into the death of their daughter.

28:55.375 --> 28:59.041
She'd recently taken out
a restraining order on her psychiatrist.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.125
Of course, it's been
a game-changer to the entire case

29:02.208 --> 29:06.333
as the police are now looking towards
finding out further information as what…

29:06.416 --> 29:07.666
[continues indistinctly]

29:07.750 --> 29:10.250
[newsman 2]
The study into crimes while under hypnosis

29:10.333 --> 29:12.375
is new to the state criminal court.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.541
There are currently board psychiatrists…

29:14.625 --> 29:16.833
[overlapping news reports]

29:18.791 --> 29:20.250
[mouse clicking]

29:20.333 --> 29:21.500
[printer whirring]

29:23.916 --> 29:27.333
[sighs] I don't know, Jenn. It's just--
I get why you'd be concerned.

29:27.416 --> 29:31.375
I mean, it's not exactly comforting news,
but I just-- I don't see it.

29:31.458 --> 29:33.583
No, look. It says here in the article,

29:33.666 --> 29:36.333
"Bowen told her family
she was experiencing missing time."

29:36.416 --> 29:39.916
That is what happened to me.
It was after I had lunch with Dr. Meade,

29:40.000 --> 29:42.041
where he suggested
I had Brian over for dinner.

29:42.125 --> 29:45.250
-It just feels like a big leap.
-Look at the background check.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.166
You ran a background check?

29:47.250 --> 29:50.375
Yes. Look,
the only address listed is his office.

29:50.458 --> 29:53.833
There's no private residence,
employers, or unpaid parking tickets.

29:53.916 --> 29:56.750
The man is basically a ghost
until six months ago

29:56.833 --> 30:00.166
when someone takes out
a restraining order. This is his patient,

30:00.250 --> 30:02.541
and he is torturing her. Stalking.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.875
Psychological abuse, emotional abuse.

30:04.958 --> 30:06.833
Maybe she was crazy.

30:08.416 --> 30:10.291
This woman was afraid for her life,

30:10.875 --> 30:13.791
and then three days
after she files a restraining order,

30:13.875 --> 30:14.791
she's dead.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.000
She had a heart attack.

30:16.083 --> 30:19.333
What if there is something else going on?

30:22.041 --> 30:25.375
-What if he did something to her?
-Okay. This is where you lose me.

30:25.458 --> 30:29.625
Therapists use hypnotherapy
to help their patients quit smoking.

30:29.708 --> 30:32.333
Not to hack into their brains
and stop their heart.

30:32.416 --> 30:35.708
-This is not a thing.
-Yes, it-- Look, I thought that too.

30:35.791 --> 30:39.000
In Sweden, a group of teenagers
are hypnotized to deal drugs,

30:39.083 --> 30:40.666
and they experienced blackouts.

30:40.750 --> 30:44.291
In Germany, Zebediah Cantor is hypnotized
to rob banks, and he has missing time--

30:44.375 --> 30:45.666
Okay, I get it.

30:57.416 --> 30:59.875
And this is from that night with Brian.

31:08.958 --> 31:10.625
He called me, Gina.

31:12.041 --> 31:13.625
Right before I blacked out.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.000
Dr. Meade?

31:19.000 --> 31:20.958
I remember everything now.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.291
I did it on purpose, Gina.

31:26.375 --> 31:29.291
It-- But it wasn't me. It was, it was--

31:29.375 --> 31:31.333
But I did do it.

31:34.041 --> 31:36.416
And then I just sat there and watched.

31:39.666 --> 31:41.208
I didn't do anything.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.416
I didn't get help.

31:45.541 --> 31:48.958
I didn't even move until I came out of it.

31:52.708 --> 31:54.666
I'm not crazy. [exhales]

31:58.000 --> 32:01.166
So, what do we do?

32:03.875 --> 32:05.875
[siren wailing in the distance]

32:08.625 --> 32:09.458
Hey.

32:10.458 --> 32:14.250
Thank you so much for meeting with us,
detective, on such short notice.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.416
-We really appreciate it.
-What can I do for you?

32:17.500 --> 32:21.708
We wanted to ask you some questions
about a woman named Andrea Bowen.

32:22.750 --> 32:23.666
Uh-huh.

32:25.083 --> 32:28.791
Six months ago, she filed
a restraining order against Collin Meade.

32:28.875 --> 32:31.083
I know the case. What's your question?

32:31.166 --> 32:33.541
Her family said
that she died of a heart attack,

32:33.625 --> 32:36.541
but then they wanted
a broader investigation.

32:37.333 --> 32:39.250
Did that investigation ever happen?

32:39.333 --> 32:40.583
Why are you asking?

32:40.666 --> 32:43.250
Because Dr. Meade is our therapist.

32:45.750 --> 32:47.541
Something strange is happening.

32:49.041 --> 32:50.416
Strange how?

32:51.125 --> 32:52.375
I've been having

32:53.958 --> 32:54.875
weird dreams.

32:54.958 --> 32:56.708
But they don't feel like dreams.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.166
You've been practicing hypnosis
with Dr. Meade, Miss Thompson?

33:01.583 --> 33:02.750
Huh.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.916
Collin Meade
was brought in for questioning

33:06.000 --> 33:07.458
a week after Bowen's death.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.416
Got us nowhere.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.541
I wanted to keep digging.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.125
I got a warrant,
obtained his patient records.

33:14.208 --> 33:15.125
Didn't matter.

33:15.708 --> 33:17.250
Got shut down that day.

33:17.333 --> 33:20.333
Told I couldn't even
finish going through what we had.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.541
Why?

33:23.041 --> 33:25.750
Meade was also
practicing hypnosis with Andrea.

33:25.833 --> 33:28.958
It's funny.
Cops using old witnesses sometimes.

33:29.041 --> 33:32.291
Try and get them to remember things
they may have seen. [clicks tongue]

33:32.791 --> 33:34.000
If it works,

33:35.791 --> 33:37.541
it becomes evidence in court,

33:38.458 --> 33:41.541
but if you're a victim,
claiming someone used hypnosis

33:41.625 --> 33:45.708
with ill intent, that kinda thing,
they'll laugh you out of the room.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.708
You don't think
she died of a heart attack?

33:51.250 --> 33:52.541
Oh my God!

33:57.625 --> 33:59.041
[detective] And then there's this.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.333
Incoming call came from a blocked number.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.875
-Her behavior changed when she answered.
-That happened to me.

34:07.458 --> 34:08.708
What is she doing?

34:09.958 --> 34:11.541
You ever heard of "quiescence"?

34:12.125 --> 34:12.958
No.

34:13.875 --> 34:16.125
It's the body's reaction to extreme fear.

34:16.916 --> 34:19.708
The body enters paralysis,
heart rate increases,

34:19.791 --> 34:21.416
breathing intensifies.

34:22.083 --> 34:23.708
But if it goes on too long, you die.

34:25.416 --> 34:27.583
Maybe, technically,
she died of a heart attack,

34:27.666 --> 34:31.333
but whatever she was seeing
in the elevator is what caused it.

34:31.916 --> 34:33.375
So, what do I think?

34:36.541 --> 34:39.041
I think you should find yourselves
a new therapist.

34:47.083 --> 34:48.791
I'll talk to you later, okay?

34:49.541 --> 34:50.375
Yeah.

34:53.958 --> 34:54.833
Jenn?

34:57.833 --> 34:59.416
He hypnotized me.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.583
What?

35:03.791 --> 35:04.625
When?

35:05.208 --> 35:06.208
This week.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.791
We talked about you, I--

35:09.958 --> 35:13.500
It's just-- You were so worried
that something happened with Brian,

35:13.583 --> 35:15.125
and then he just--

35:15.208 --> 35:19.666
He said he was wrong before,
and then he thought that it might help me.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.000
It's okay, it's okay.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.416
We'll do what Det. Rollins said.
We'll stay away.

35:31.083 --> 35:33.083
We'll figure this out, okay?

35:43.291 --> 35:46.666
Hey, Dr. Meade, it's Jennifer Thompson.
We just saw each other,

35:46.750 --> 35:50.208
but I was wondering if you had
any last-minute appointments available.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.166
Call me back when you can. Bye.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.250
[thrilling music]

36:04.708 --> 36:06.125
[door opens]

36:15.375 --> 36:18.291
Jennifer. Please, come in.

36:20.666 --> 36:24.083
-I was thrilled to get your call.
-Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in.

36:25.791 --> 36:30.250
Was there something in particular
you wanted to talk about?

36:31.125 --> 36:35.500
No. Not-- Nothing really, actually.
It's just, um,

36:36.791 --> 36:38.166
a general anxiety.

36:39.291 --> 36:40.333
[Meade] Mm-hmm.

36:41.375 --> 36:44.833
Brian's not awake yet, and so that's hard.

36:45.416 --> 36:46.375
Yeah.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.000
I thought just a bit
of hypnosis might help?

36:54.208 --> 36:55.166
Of course.

36:57.125 --> 36:58.041
Okay.

37:00.708 --> 37:02.916
[thrilling music continues]

37:17.708 --> 37:19.708
[inquisitive music]

37:40.541 --> 37:41.958
[Wade inhales]

37:53.666 --> 37:54.916
[Wade] Lillian Dorsey.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.916
Date of death, 11/27/2019.

38:03.375 --> 38:06.833
-[phone line trilling]
-[Wade] I'm looking for Adrienne Dorsey.

38:06.916 --> 38:09.500
This is Detective Wade Rollins
with the Portland PD.

38:09.583 --> 38:13.083
I was hoping I could ask you
some questions regarding your sister.

38:13.166 --> 38:16.750
Date of death, June 15, 2018. Hypnosis.

38:16.833 --> 38:18.375
Andrea Bowen. Hypnosis.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.083
[inquisitive music fades out]

38:27.041 --> 38:29.541
[Meade on recording]
Was there something in particular

38:29.625 --> 38:31.291
you wanted to talk about?

38:32.041 --> 38:35.333
[Jenn] I thought just a bit
of hypnosis might help?

38:36.125 --> 38:37.000
[Meade] Of course.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.166
[fast-forwarding]

38:40.666 --> 38:41.708
[Meade] Jennifer?

38:42.291 --> 38:44.166
-[Jenn] Yes?
-[Meade] Are you under?

38:44.250 --> 38:45.791
-[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] Good.

38:46.458 --> 38:50.666
I'm going to ask you some questions,
and you're gonna tell me the truth.

38:51.750 --> 38:54.083
Why did you really come see me today?

38:54.666 --> 38:55.666
[Jenn] To record you.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
[Meade] Are you recording me now?

38:59.083 --> 39:00.000
[Jenn] Yes.

39:00.916 --> 39:03.750
-[Meade] And why are you recording me?
-[menacing music]

39:03.833 --> 39:07.250
[Jenn] Because I want to hear
what happens during our sessions.

39:07.333 --> 39:10.000
-[Meade] Do you not trust me?
-[Jenn] No.

39:10.708 --> 39:12.041
[Meade] Hmm.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.416
Why not?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.083
[Jenn] Because I know about Andrea Bowen.

39:19.083 --> 39:21.666
[Meade] Is this why you were
at the police station this morning?

39:22.791 --> 39:23.791
[Jenn] Yes.

39:25.625 --> 39:26.875
[Meade] You were with Gina.

39:28.625 --> 39:30.625
I assume she knows everything you know.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.833
-[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] Yes.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.750
Thank you for being honest, my love.

39:39.833 --> 39:41.833
-[engine revs]
-[tires screech]

39:43.083 --> 39:45.625
-[Scott] Dude, what quarter is it?
-[Gina] Tell him to not--

39:45.708 --> 39:48.083
No, they are not up
by seven, bro! [laughs]

39:48.166 --> 39:50.750
-I'm serious. Hang up.
-I gotta go before she kills me.

39:50.833 --> 39:52.416
[phone chiming]

39:52.500 --> 39:53.791
-See?
-No, it's Jenn!

39:54.375 --> 39:58.208
Tell him I told him wassup!
Keep me informed. Yeah, okay, peace.

39:59.541 --> 40:02.291
Girl, I gotta call you back.
I have buyers calling any minute.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.500
[tires screech]

40:03.583 --> 40:07.083
-Gina. Gina, where are you?
-I'm just in the car with Scott.

40:07.166 --> 40:09.000
-[Scott] Hey, Jenny.
-Where are you?

40:09.083 --> 40:10.416
We just left the house.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.250
Turn around and go back to the house.

40:12.333 --> 40:13.833
-I'm coming to you.
-What? Why?

40:13.916 --> 40:17.208
Could you go back to the house?
You need to go back, listen to me.

40:17.291 --> 40:20.375
-Gina, get--
-I'm sorry, you're cutting out. I can't--

40:20.458 --> 40:21.541
[phone chiming]

40:21.625 --> 40:23.208
This is them. I'll call you back.

40:23.291 --> 40:27.000
No, Gina! He knows we were
at the police station. He knows!

40:27.083 --> 40:28.083
[phone hangs up]

40:28.166 --> 40:29.125
Gina?

40:30.541 --> 40:31.541
Fucking shit!

40:31.625 --> 40:33.500
[engine revving]

40:35.166 --> 40:38.166
[tires screeching]

40:43.166 --> 40:44.416
This is Gina.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.416
[Meade] Gina, it's Dr. Meade.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.041
Sorry to bother you,
but do you have a moment to chat?

40:49.625 --> 40:51.291
I'm just in the car with Scott.

40:51.375 --> 40:54.541
[Meade] Even better.
Gina, this is how the world ends.

40:54.625 --> 40:55.958
-[phone beeps]
-[whoosh]

40:56.625 --> 40:57.833
What was that?

40:57.916 --> 40:59.208
[menacing music]

41:00.958 --> 41:02.291
[Gina gasps]

41:04.791 --> 41:05.875
[quietly] Get it off of me.

41:06.583 --> 41:07.708
What?

41:08.291 --> 41:09.291
Scott.

41:09.375 --> 41:10.875
-[Scott] Gina.
-[Gina shudders]

41:13.666 --> 41:16.416
-Get what off?
-Get it off. Please!

41:16.500 --> 41:18.541
What? There's nothing there. Get what off?

41:18.625 --> 41:20.958
-Get it off of me! Please!
-Gina, relax. Gina!

41:21.041 --> 41:23.416
[screaming] Get it off!

41:23.500 --> 41:24.500
Gina, stop!

41:24.583 --> 41:27.208
Get it off! Get it off!

41:27.291 --> 41:29.166
-[truck horn blares]
-[Scott] No!

41:32.958 --> 41:34.958
[ominous music playing]

41:41.583 --> 41:43.583

42:09.833 --> 42:12.666

42:35.708 --> 42:36.791
[contented sigh]

42:57.208 --> 42:58.250
[sighs]

42:58.750 --> 42:59.750
[music stops]

43:04.666 --> 43:07.791
Detective Rollins.
What a pleasant surprise.

43:09.083 --> 43:10.250
Care for a scotch?

43:12.541 --> 43:14.541
[tense music]

43:17.083 --> 43:19.625
Gina Kaleman died
in a car accident tonight.

43:21.291 --> 43:22.166
[Meade] What?

43:25.125 --> 43:27.541
-Her husband too.
-You're kidding me.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.708
Oh my God.

43:33.666 --> 43:35.125
How long was she a patient?

43:36.750 --> 43:38.416
[Meade] I don't know. Maybe…

43:38.500 --> 43:39.750
[glass thuds against table]

43:40.250 --> 43:41.166
…eight months?

43:42.166 --> 43:46.750
-[Wade] What were you treating her for?
-She came to me with some, uh…

43:46.833 --> 43:48.000
[glass clinking]

43:48.083 --> 43:50.625
…generalized anxiety initially.

43:50.708 --> 43:52.500
[tense music continues]

43:52.583 --> 43:53.458
[Wade] Hmm.

43:54.875 --> 43:58.333
You ever perform hypnosis on Gina?

43:58.416 --> 44:01.708
Yes. Uh, we performed
our first session last week.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.583
Started small, you know?

44:04.458 --> 44:06.791
-Explored her common phobia.
-Claustrophobia?

44:06.875 --> 44:08.000
Arachnophobia.

44:10.083 --> 44:14.291
The last claustrophobic patient
I dealt with was, uh…

44:15.500 --> 44:18.583
Well, it was Andrea Bowen, actually.

44:19.083 --> 44:20.083
[Wade] Hmm.

44:21.791 --> 44:23.583
You know what I always loved as a kid?

44:24.375 --> 44:25.333
Puzzles.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.208
[sets glass on table]

44:27.291 --> 44:30.375
I'm sure it has something to do
with why I became a detective.

44:31.291 --> 44:34.291
Putting the pieces together,
finding the patterns.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.708
That was always the key.

44:37.666 --> 44:38.625
Patterns.

44:39.750 --> 44:42.416
I looked through
some of your patient files today.

44:43.750 --> 44:46.000
The ones we obtained after Andrea's death.

44:47.541 --> 44:50.208
I got to chat with family members,
and I noticed something.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.000
A pattern.

44:53.666 --> 44:56.208
You don't use hypnotherapy
on all of your patients.

44:58.166 --> 44:59.666
Just a few, actually.

45:01.333 --> 45:02.750
Andrea Bowen.

45:03.541 --> 45:04.875
Lillian Dorsey.

45:05.541 --> 45:06.791
Mona Szohr.

45:07.750 --> 45:10.000
They share some physical characteristics,

45:11.541 --> 45:13.708
and they also all happen to be dead.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.791
You ever noticed that?

45:17.958 --> 45:18.958
That pattern?

45:21.041 --> 45:22.083
[sniffles]

45:25.083 --> 45:26.250
[Meade clears throat]

45:28.125 --> 45:30.250
Gina Kaleman doesn't match your MO.

45:30.333 --> 45:33.291
I think you had something else in mind
when it came to her.

45:33.375 --> 45:37.125
Is there something specific
you wanted to talk about tonight, Wade?

45:37.208 --> 45:38.166
[Wade sighs]

45:38.250 --> 45:40.583
Because if not, I should be going.
It's getting late.

45:41.750 --> 45:43.333
[Wade] It's Detective Rollins.

45:44.958 --> 45:47.416
-Thanks for the booze.
-[Meade] Oh, Wade.

45:48.500 --> 45:51.291
Hypnotherapy works wonders for insomnia.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.125
You wanna try it?
I'll give you a free session.

45:54.208 --> 45:56.416
Thought you only took female patients.

45:56.500 --> 45:58.041
I'll make an exception.

45:59.083 --> 46:01.083
[tense music continues]

46:04.375 --> 46:05.375
[door shuts]

46:10.000 --> 46:11.416
[music fades]

46:12.916 --> 46:14.333
[gentle knocking on door]

46:21.916 --> 46:23.583
My phone died, or I would have called.

46:24.458 --> 46:26.458
[gloomy music]

46:27.833 --> 46:29.750
Um, I heard about your friend.

46:31.083 --> 46:35.833
I just thought I could catch him
saying something or doing something.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
He was at the station.
He's been following us.

46:41.458 --> 46:42.583
He's smart.

46:43.625 --> 46:44.958
Always a step ahead.

46:46.125 --> 46:49.958
There's a reason he never hypnotized Gina
until you started asking questions.

46:50.708 --> 46:53.208
He knew you would go to her.
She got in the way.

46:54.416 --> 46:56.041
You can't blame yourself, Jenn.

46:56.666 --> 46:58.125
And just why me?

46:58.625 --> 46:59.750
Well, I don't know.

47:01.500 --> 47:04.208
But not long after Andrea
started asking questions,

47:04.833 --> 47:06.000
she was dead.

47:07.333 --> 47:10.375
He's not done with you yet,
or you would be too.

47:13.666 --> 47:17.666
I got his prints. I'm gonna run 'em,
see if we're missing anything.

47:18.833 --> 47:20.500
I should know more tomorrow.

47:21.583 --> 47:22.583
For now,

47:23.583 --> 47:24.500
lay low.

47:24.583 --> 47:25.791
[door clicks open]

47:26.416 --> 47:27.416
[Jenn] Detective.

47:28.458 --> 47:29.375
Thank you.

47:30.458 --> 47:31.916
Try and get some rest.

47:32.708 --> 47:34.166
I'll call you in the morning.

47:40.750 --> 47:41.750
[sighs]

47:55.333 --> 47:56.750
[chair scraping]

48:02.666 --> 48:04.250
[knocking on door]

48:05.958 --> 48:07.500
Did you forget something?

48:07.583 --> 48:08.500
Hello, Jennifer.

48:08.583 --> 48:10.083
[dramatic music]

48:11.916 --> 48:13.250
Jennifer, stop!

48:13.333 --> 48:14.833
-[whoosh]
-[music fades]

48:15.333 --> 48:16.416
[exhales sharply]

48:18.166 --> 48:19.166
[door clicks shut]

48:21.291 --> 48:22.375
[inhales]

48:22.458 --> 48:25.916
You don't need to be afraid of me.
I just wanna talk.

48:28.708 --> 48:32.291
What did I do to you
to make you not trust me?

48:32.916 --> 48:33.916
Huh?

48:35.583 --> 48:36.791
[firmly] Think about it.

48:37.541 --> 48:39.333
I invited you in. I listened.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.500
Really, you should be thanking me.

48:43.833 --> 48:47.958
I asked you what you wanted,
and I'm working so hard to give you that.

48:48.458 --> 48:50.458
[ominous music]

48:53.791 --> 48:57.708
And Brian and Gina were just gonna
get in the way of your dreams.

48:57.791 --> 48:59.416
And now Rollins.

49:01.125 --> 49:03.125
[Jenn breathes shakily]

49:03.208 --> 49:05.541
Don't worry. He'll be taken care of.

49:06.416 --> 49:10.208
Everything I'm doing is for you, Jennifer.

49:12.250 --> 49:14.041
And I know there's been a lot of

49:15.083 --> 49:18.708
build-up and anticipation, but…

49:20.458 --> 49:22.541
that's just the romantic in me.

49:23.041 --> 49:25.041
[ominous music continues]

49:27.333 --> 49:30.000
-It's almost over.
-[Jenn shudders]

49:34.291 --> 49:35.791
[quietly] You're so close.

49:42.708 --> 49:43.583
Hmm?

49:49.708 --> 49:51.291
I'll see you soon, okay?

49:53.916 --> 49:55.958
Oh, Jennifer…

49:56.708 --> 49:58.416
-Relax.
-[Jenn gasps]

49:58.500 --> 50:00.500
[panting]

50:00.583 --> 50:02.583
[music turns thrilling]

50:04.625 --> 50:06.625
[continues panting]

50:14.458 --> 50:15.958
[quietly] Pick up. Pick up.

50:16.625 --> 50:18.500
[Wade] This is Detective Wade Rollins--

50:18.583 --> 50:19.875
Come on, come on.

50:40.041 --> 50:41.208
[sighs]

50:45.083 --> 50:46.791
[woman on TV]
When the police ran his prints,

50:46.875 --> 50:50.416
they discovered his real identity.
He had changed his name.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.375
[man on TV] And who was he, really?

50:52.458 --> 50:55.416
[woman] A killer.
Wanted for murder in three states.

50:55.916 --> 50:57.916
[distant creaking]

50:58.416 --> 51:00.666

51:54.000 --> 51:56.500
[male narrator]
Tonight, on The Crime Files.

51:56.583 --> 51:58.666
In the fall of 2014,

51:58.750 --> 52:02.875
seventeen-year-old Victoria Wilson
disappeared from her suburban home

52:02.958 --> 52:04.541
in Metuchen, New Jersey,

52:04.625 --> 52:07.250
leaving her parents
and four younger siblings

52:07.333 --> 52:09.500
heartbroken and terrified.

52:09.583 --> 52:14.416
Three days later, her body was found
in a forest 300 miles from home.

52:15.083 --> 52:17.541
So, what happened to Victoria Wilson?

52:19.083 --> 52:21.125
Billy Adler came home from school

52:21.208 --> 52:23.916
to find his mom dead
at the dining room table,

52:24.000 --> 52:25.500
shot in the head.

52:25.583 --> 52:29.166
The police ruled it a suicide.
But Billy knew his mom would nev--

52:29.250 --> 52:30.291
[woman gasps]

52:30.375 --> 52:32.166
[screams]

52:32.875 --> 52:35.125
[both grunting and groaning]

52:42.125 --> 52:43.625
[Wade groans]

52:44.041 --> 52:45.916
[both grunting]

52:49.000 --> 52:51.250
[Wade screams]

52:51.333 --> 52:52.541
[grunts]

52:54.166 --> 52:56.708
[grunting and groaning continue]

53:09.125 --> 53:10.291
[Wade grunts]

53:11.750 --> 53:12.958
[groans]

53:26.166 --> 53:28.666
I can't tell them
I think Meade was involved.

53:29.333 --> 53:31.291
They don't know
I've been digging into this.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.625
[monitor beeping]

53:33.458 --> 53:35.208
I'm so sorry, Rollins.

53:35.708 --> 53:37.708
[indistinct announcement over PA]

53:40.500 --> 53:41.583
You read 'em?

53:44.833 --> 53:45.791
And?

53:47.458 --> 53:48.833
And I have an idea.

53:50.750 --> 53:53.666
When Gina and I came to see you,
you said something about

53:53.750 --> 53:56.750
how police sometimes use hypnosis.

53:56.833 --> 53:57.916
[Wade] Hm.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.041
What did you mean?

54:00.708 --> 54:03.875
A drive-by shooter
speeds away from the scene.

54:05.208 --> 54:08.583
An eyewitness saw the car
but can't remember the license plate.

54:09.250 --> 54:11.750
[clears throat]
Well, maybe they do remember it.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.625
Just not consciously.

54:14.458 --> 54:18.791
So, we send them to a hypnotist
who tries to help them recall.

54:20.333 --> 54:22.041
And that will hold up as evidence?

54:22.125 --> 54:23.875
-Sometimes.
-What if we did that?

54:24.791 --> 54:28.541
What if you sent me
to whoever you use for that sort of thing?

54:28.625 --> 54:30.125
And they put me under

54:30.666 --> 54:33.333
and try to make me recall
my sessions with Meade.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.458
-It still may not be enough.
-You just said--

54:36.541 --> 54:38.000
I said, "Sometimes."

54:39.375 --> 54:41.875
Do you know how hard it is
to charge someone with murder

54:42.583 --> 54:43.708
and get them convicted?

54:43.791 --> 54:47.083
But he all but confessed to me
that he's responsible for Brian and Gina.

54:47.166 --> 54:49.333
-You recorded it?
-He said he was coming after--

54:49.416 --> 54:50.250
Jenn.

54:51.541 --> 54:55.208
With everything else we have,
the other victims, the pattern…

54:56.875 --> 54:59.833
He's planning something. I know he is.

55:00.375 --> 55:03.250
I don't know what,
but the way he was talking last night--

55:06.291 --> 55:07.166
Please.

55:09.666 --> 55:10.916
I just wanna try.

55:14.958 --> 55:16.958
[evocative music]

55:25.791 --> 55:28.791
-[monitor beeping]
-[oxygen hissing]

55:41.041 --> 55:42.333
Please wake up.

55:53.166 --> 55:54.541
[Meade] You were with Gina.

55:55.958 --> 55:57.916
I assume she knows everything you know.

55:58.416 --> 55:59.875
-[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] Yes.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.625
Well, thank you for being honest, my love.

56:04.583 --> 56:07.291
I'll take all of your concerns
into consideration.

56:09.250 --> 56:10.791
And then he cuts it short.

56:13.750 --> 56:14.666
Jenn.

56:15.916 --> 56:19.166
How much do you really know
about hypnotherapy?

56:19.250 --> 56:20.875
[sniffles] Not much.

56:20.958 --> 56:23.333
Well, it's an incredibly powerful tool.

56:24.708 --> 56:27.500
When handled with care and integrity,

56:27.583 --> 56:29.500
it can be a force for good.

56:30.666 --> 56:33.583
But in the wrong hands,
hypnosis can be dangerous.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.416
What are you feeling?

56:43.500 --> 56:47.375
[exhales deeply] I am having, um,

56:47.458 --> 56:51.166
some trust issues
with your profession right now.

56:53.625 --> 56:56.791
Jenn, I understand
that this may not be worth much,

56:57.791 --> 56:59.416
but you can trust me.

57:00.833 --> 57:02.375
I'm one of the good ones.

57:03.416 --> 57:05.333
And I'm only gonna have a look around.

57:06.666 --> 57:11.208
Just see what the subconscious retained
from those sessions with Dr. Meade.

57:11.875 --> 57:12.708
Hmm?

57:14.333 --> 57:16.791
[deep sigh]

57:21.416 --> 57:23.708
[doctor] Focus on the sound
of the metronome,

57:24.583 --> 57:25.833
keeping time.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.375
And as you feel the weight of your body

57:30.958 --> 57:33.333
sinking into the couch,

57:33.416 --> 57:36.083
I want you to let everything go.

57:37.666 --> 57:41.875
Let the world around you slow down.

57:43.125 --> 57:45.541
[ticks faintly]

57:49.583 --> 57:50.916
[metronome stops suddenly]

57:51.666 --> 57:54.166
[doctor] Jenn, can you hear me?

57:54.250 --> 57:55.166
[Jenn] Yes.

57:55.791 --> 57:59.041
[doctor] Now, I want you to tell me
everything you remember

57:59.125 --> 58:02.500
from your sessions with Dr. Collin Meade.

58:03.500 --> 58:05.375
[thunder rumbles]

58:07.250 --> 58:08.291
[choking]

58:08.375 --> 58:09.250
Jenn?

58:12.916 --> 58:14.166
[choking]

58:14.250 --> 58:15.625
Wake up, Jenn.

58:15.708 --> 58:16.750
Jennifer!

58:18.708 --> 58:21.333
I need you to listen
to the sound of my voice

58:21.416 --> 58:23.750
and come back to this room right now!

58:23.833 --> 58:26.250
-[metronome stops]
-[birds chirping]

58:28.833 --> 58:31.750
[Meade] My mentor was a psychiatrist.

Dr. Xavier Sullivan.

59:24.666 --> 59:26.916
-[panting]
-[metronome ticking]

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
What happened?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.416
Dr. Graham, what happened?

59:32.500 --> 59:33.958
[Dr. Graham panting]

59:34.750 --> 59:35.750
[sighs]

59:40.041 --> 59:42.083
I've never seen anything like that.

59:44.208 --> 59:46.375
He must have planted some sort of

59:47.583 --> 59:48.583
fail-safe or--

59:48.666 --> 59:49.750
What's a fail-safe?

59:49.833 --> 59:52.333
In case anybody
ever tried to do what we're doing.

59:53.541 --> 59:55.208
And I have no way of knowing

59:55.291 --> 59:58.833
how many sustained
post-hypnotic suggestions he placed.

1:00:01.208 --> 1:00:03.541
And these can be triggered
at any given moment.

1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:06.916
[soft brooding music]

1:00:14.500 --> 1:00:15.791
I remember something.

1:00:19.541 --> 1:00:20.708
There was a house.

1:00:33.041 --> 1:00:34.250
What's today's date?

1:00:35.083 --> 1:00:36.208
It's the sixth.

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.125
-I have to go.
-No, wait.

1:00:47.916 --> 1:00:50.208
There's one more thing I could try.

1:00:50.291 --> 1:00:52.416
Look, I can't remove
all of his suggestions,

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:56.416
but maybe I could plant
something of my own.

1:00:57.958 --> 1:00:59.458
Like a counter trigger?

1:01:02.083 --> 1:01:03.000
Exactly.

1:01:05.750 --> 1:01:08.416
I swear to God,
this is the last time I'm doing this.

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.500
[fast-paced, thrilling music]

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:49.541
[Jenn] Rollins, it didn't work.

1:01:49.625 --> 1:01:53.000
But I found out that Meade
has a mentor named Xavier Sullivan.

1:01:53.083 --> 1:01:53.916
[Wade] Okay.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.708
[Jenn] Have you heard
of "Project MKUltra"?

1:01:56.791 --> 1:01:59.375
[Wade] Yeah, it was a CIA project
in the '60s.

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:02.958
[Jenn] Well, Sullivan is a hypnotist.
And the CIA had recruited him

1:02:03.041 --> 1:02:05.958
to use hypnosis
to plant false memories in people.

1:02:06.041 --> 1:02:07.708
I'm on my way to see him.

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:09.583
[Wade] No, Jenn, that's not a good idea.

1:02:09.666 --> 1:02:12.583
[Jenn] He might know something
about Meade that can help us.

1:02:12.666 --> 1:02:14.666
-[Wade] Just wait for me.
-[Jenn] We don't have time.

1:02:14.750 --> 1:02:16.708
[Wade] Jenn. Jenn!

1:02:16.791 --> 1:02:18.750
[music turns suspenseful]

-Door is locked. I don't know!

1:06:20.833 --> 1:06:22.291
you even smell like her.

1:06:23.625 --> 1:06:26.041
There's nothing
quite like a woman's scent.

1:06:53.875 --> 1:06:55.750
and they seemed right at first,

1:06:55.833 --> 1:06:58.083
but ultimately,

1:06:59.041 --> 1:07:00.583

[Wade] Ankle.

1:18:31.875 --> 1:18:32.833
[Meade] Come here!

1:18:34.625 --> 1:18:35.666
[gunshot]

1:18:35.750 --> 1:18:37.458
[wheezing]

1:18:40.166 --> 1:18:41.541
[gunshot]

1:18:42.291 --> 1:18:43.458
[groans]

1:18:54.041 --> 1:18:54.875
Hey.

1:18:54.958 --> 1:18:57.291
No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! Hi.

1:18:57.375 --> 1:18:59.208
Right here. Look at me, look at me.

1:18:59.291 --> 1:19:01.166
Look at me, look at me. Yes.

1:19:01.250 --> 1:19:03.541
Hi, hi! You're okay, you're okay.

1:19:04.125 --> 1:19:06.458
-[weakly] You shot me.
-[Jenn] I'm sorry.

1:19:06.541 --> 1:19:10.875
Stay-- Yeah. Stay with me. Hi.
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.

1:19:10.958 --> 1:19:14.125
-[whispering] Stay with me, okay?
-[sirens wailing]

1:19:14.208 --> 1:19:18.708
[Jenn] I can hear them. I hear sirens.
They are coming. It's okay.

1:19:18.791 --> 1:19:21.208
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1:19:22.458 --> 1:19:25.458
[dramatic music]

1:19:46.541 --> 1:19:49.500
I think it's great. We present it
to the team at Monday's meeting.

1:19:49.583 --> 1:19:51.000
But I'm a huge fan.

1:19:51.958 --> 1:19:53.708
Uh-huh. Great work, Tiff.

1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:55.916
Yeah, I'll see you then.

1:20:02.083 --> 1:20:04.041
I'm definitely moving. [chuckles]

1:20:04.875 --> 1:20:07.625
You'll like the new place.
You don't have to. I understand.

1:20:07.708 --> 1:20:09.875
I know you're very particular
about your things.

1:20:10.625 --> 1:20:12.625
[monitor beeping]

1:20:13.208 --> 1:20:15.208
[melancholic music]

1:20:16.041 --> 1:20:17.208
I'm sorry.

1:20:19.458 --> 1:20:20.958
I'm sorry I left.

1:20:23.333 --> 1:20:25.708
I'm sorry
I didn't share my grief with you.

1:20:27.708 --> 1:20:31.000
I'm sorry that I thought losing Daniel

1:20:31.625 --> 1:20:33.583
was harder for me than it was for you.

1:20:34.166 --> 1:20:36.500
And I know it's not my fault
what happened to him.

1:20:36.583 --> 1:20:38.916
No matter how much I wanna blame myself.

1:20:43.333 --> 1:20:47.375
But it is my fault what happened to us.

1:20:51.708 --> 1:20:54.125
And for that, I'm really, truly sorry.

1:21:03.708 --> 1:21:05.791
The doctors say your tests are promising.

1:21:06.375 --> 1:21:07.833
That's really good news.

1:21:09.708 --> 1:21:12.250
And when you wake up,
I'll be sitting right here.

1:21:17.708 --> 1:21:19.708
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:22.208
[telephone ringing]

1:21:27.791 --> 1:21:30.041
-My condolences on your promotion.
-[chuckles]

1:21:30.708 --> 1:21:32.166
I'm regretting it already.

1:21:32.708 --> 1:21:36.750
I left you alone,
but I did wanna say thank you

1:21:37.250 --> 1:21:38.291
for everything.

1:21:39.583 --> 1:21:41.875
I wasn't sure when I'd see you again, but…

1:21:43.416 --> 1:21:45.375
I figured you'd come around eventually.

1:21:47.375 --> 1:21:49.041
A token of my appreciation.

1:21:50.875 --> 1:21:52.291
Take care of yourself, yeah?

1:21:55.291 --> 1:21:57.291
[tranquil music]

1:22:13.958 --> 1:22:14.833
[laughs]

1:22:20.333 --> 1:22:21.416
Well played.

1:22:27.750 --> 1:22:29.750
[thumping music]

1:23:36.666 --> 1:23:37.833
[thumping music ends]

1:23:39.333 --> 1:23:42.583
[gentle ethereal music playing]

1:25:20.041 --> 1:25:22.916
[ethereal music fades
into gentle percussive music]

1:27:41.291 --> 1:27:42.791
[percussive music ends]

1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:47.958
[eerie, pulsating music playing]
