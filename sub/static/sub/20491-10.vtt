I'M MORE THAN YOU COULD HANDLE.

00:32.334 --> 00:35.501
WANT TO TRY THIS AGAIN?

00:35.601 --> 00:38.100
HE MAY BE STAYING
NEARBY, WITH THE GIRL.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.200
WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK?

00:43.067 --> 00:45.234

01:18.667 --> 01:19.634
OH, GOOD.

01:19.734 --> 01:21.901
GO DO THEM.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.534
AS SOON AS YOU TELL ME WHERE
YOU KEEP GOING ON THESE

01:23.634 --> 01:25.634
SECRET LITTLE SIDE MISSIONS.

01:25.734 --> 01:29.167
WELL, THEN, THEY WOULDN'T BE
VERY SECRET NOW, WOULD THEY?

01:29.267 --> 01:32.000
I DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU.

01:32.100 --> 01:36.601
YEAH, YOU DO - IF YOU EXPECT
TO LOSE ME AS YOUR SHADOW.

01:37.968 --> 01:39.300
WHO'S THE GUY?

01:39.400 --> 01:42.234
SOMEONE I'VE BEEN SEARCHING
FOR FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS.

01:42.334 --> 01:44.601
DON'T WORRY. HE'S
NOT MUTANT X BUSINESS, OKAY?

01:48.267 --> 01:51.634
<SCREAMING>

01:51.734 --> 01:52.801
WHAT IS IT?

01:52.901 --> 01:54.734
SCREAMING.

02:03.834 --> 02:04.634
CAN YOU STILL HEAR IT?

02:04.734 --> 02:05.601
NO.

02:11.968 --> 02:13.667
OKAY. I CAN HANDLE
IT FROM HERE.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.133
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:15.234 --> 02:16.234
HEY, I'M SERIOUS.

02:16.334 --> 02:18.367
SO AM I.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.334
LOOK.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.734
OH, MY GOD.

02:43.267 --> 02:45.267
IT'S THE GIRL FROM YOUR PHOTO.

02:45.367 --> 02:48.100
SHE'S DEAD.

02:54.868 --> 02:57.567
HEY, LEX, IF THE GUY YOU'RE
AFTER IS A PART OF THIS,

02:57.667 --> 02:59.100
WE NEED TO FIND HIM.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.000
LISTEN, YOU STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.601
I'M NOT GOING TO WARN YOU AGAIN.

SO WHAT DID LEXA SAY?

04:13.801 --> 04:15.634
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

04:15.734 --> 04:17.067
SHE KEEPS SHUTTING ME OUT.

04:17.166 --> 04:19.132
WELL, THERE'S A SURPRISE.

04:19.233 --> 04:23.067
SHE TOOK SOMETHING
FROM THE MURDER SCENE,
SOME KIND OF NECKLACE.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.634
I THINK SHE'S IN OVER
HER HEAD THIS TIME.

04:24.734 --> 04:26.601
WHATEVER SHE'S
HIDING, IT SCARES HER.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.067
LEXA?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.934
AND THE GUY SHE'S FOLLOWING -
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S TRYING TO

04:30.033 --> 04:32.000
PROTECT HIM OR JUST WANTS
TO GET TO HIM FIRST.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.534
WELL, EITHER WAY,
I DON'T LIKE IT.

04:34.634 --> 04:37.367
LOOK, IF HE SCARES HER
THIS BAD, WE CAN'T LET HER
GO AFTER HIM ALONE.

04:37.467 --> 04:38.701
WELL, WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

04:38.801 --> 04:41.067
SHE WON'T EVEN TALK
TO US ABOUT IT.

04:41.167 --> 04:43.667
STOP ASKING.

04:58.567 --> 05:01.400
IS A CLOSED DOOR TOO
HARD A CONCEPT FOR YOU?

05:01.501 --> 05:02.968
YOU'RE HANDLING THIS ALL WRONG.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.200
REALLY?

05:04.300 --> 05:05.501
ENLIGHTEN ME.

05:05.601 --> 05:07.834
WELL, NORMALLY YOU JUST
WOULD'VE LIED TO SHALIMAR.

05:07.934 --> 05:10.634
BUT NOW SHE AND JESS
ARE ALL OVER THIS.

05:10.734 --> 05:11.767
YOU'RE OFF YOUR GAME, LEX.

05:11.868 --> 05:14.934
AND THAT'S DANGEROUS
FOR ALL OF US.

05:15.033 --> 05:17.834

05:21.300 --> 05:23.300

LEO KILLED HER.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.067

CAN USE SOME BACKUP.

COME AGAIN.

06:33.868 --> 06:35.367
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

06:35.467 --> 06:36.501
SURE.

06:36.601 --> 06:39.133
YEAH, HE STAYS
WITH HER SOMETIMES.

THAT UP THERE, TOO?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.334
WELL, YEAH...

06:45.434 --> 06:47.868
A COP JUST CAME IN TO
WATCH LAST NIGHT'S TAPE.

06:47.968 --> 06:48.934
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.100
WELL, WE NEED TO SEE IT.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.801
AND I NEED A NIGHT
WITH ANGELINA JOLIE.

HAVE TO SHOW YOU SH... UGH...

KEEP BREATHING, EITHER.

US, I JUST MIGHT LET YOU.

OKAY. COME ON IN.

IT'S JUST A COMMON SYMBOL.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.767
BUT WE DID MANAGE TO FIND
AN ID ON THE DEAD GIRL.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.067

THIS BEHIND LEXA'S BACK.

07:30.567 --> 07:33.634
LOOK, JESS, SHE'S THE ONE
THAT SHUT US OUT, OKAY?

07:33.734 --> 07:35.968
BESIDES, I THINK IT'S TIME WE
REMIND HER WE'RE MUTANT X -

07:36.067 --> 07:38.501
NOT MUTANT LEX.

07:38.601 --> 07:39.734
STILL...

07:39.834 --> 07:42.334
FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING
THROUGH HER DIARY HERE.

07:42.434 --> 07:46.033

DESERVES BETTER FROM US.

08:00.367 --> 08:02.234
BUT I COULD TELL SHE
WAS BUTCHERED THOUGH. WHY?

08:02.334 --> 08:07.534
WELL, SHE WASN'T BUTCHERED,
SHE WAS... DISSECTED.

08:10.334 --> 08:12.567
THEY TOOK HER LIVER.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.334
TOOK IT?

08:14.434 --> 08:17.901
WHAT, LIKE A TROPHY?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.167
WHAT KIND OF FREAK ARE
WE DEALING WITH HERE?

08:23.100 --> 08:26.701
I TRUST YOU'LL BE VERY
HAPPY WITH THE MATERIAL.

08:31.601 --> 08:35.433

STILL BE ATTACHED. <LAUGHS>

09:01.934 --> 09:04.400

WE COULD TAKE HIM.

LOOKING GOOD, LEX.

10:10.968 --> 10:12.801

YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:12.901 --> 10:17.767
AND YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE AFTER HIM, HM?

UH, BLOND.

10:41.567 --> 10:44.834

FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO.

10:45.701 --> 10:47.100
WHATCHA GOT FOR US, HANDSOME?

10:47.200 --> 10:50.467
WELL, LEXA WANTED THIS MEDALLION
BAD ENOUGH TO STEAL IT.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.734
I FIGURE IT'S GOT TO BELONG
TO THE GUY SHE'S AFTER.

10:52.834 --> 10:53.868
I AGREE.

10:53.968 --> 10:55.133
WHAT DOES THAT GET US?

10:55.234 --> 10:56.300
WELL, THERE GOTTA BE SKIN CELLS.

GOT ME HIS DNA.

11:00.868 --> 11:04.100
LOOK...

11:04.200 --> 11:05.367
HE'S A MUTANT.

11:05.467 --> 11:07.167
LUCKY US.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.734
I'M GOING TO RUN HIM
THROUGH ADAM'S DATABASE.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.834
THERE HE IS.

11:13.934 --> 11:14.934
OH.

11:15.033 --> 11:15.968
OH...

11:16.067 --> 11:17.501
WAIT, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

11:17.601 --> 11:19.167
WELL, MAYBE THE
SAMPLE'S CONTAMINATED.

11:19.267 --> 11:21.834
YEAH.

11:21.934 --> 11:23.534
NO.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.367
ALL THESE IDS BELONG
TO THE SAME DNA.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.467
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME PERSON.

11:27.567 --> 11:30.968
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.868
OH, MY GOD.

11:34.968 --> 11:36.467
I HEARD THEORETICAL
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS,

11:36.567 --> 11:39.067
BUT NEVER KNEW
THAT ONE EXISTED.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.567
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.434
HE'S A MULTIPLE.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.467
HE'S A MUTANT WITH THE ABILITY
TO CHANGE HIS PHYSIOLOGY TO BE

11:44.567 --> 11:48.000
SEPARATE PEOPLE WITH SEPARATE
IDENTITIES, BUT THE SAME DNA.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.267
SO HE'S A MUTANT VERSION
OF A MULTIPLE PERSONALITY.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.634
WELL, IF HE IS ALL THESE
PEOPLE, HOW THE HELL ARE WE

11:52.734 --> 11:54.367
GOING TO FIND HIM... HER...

11:54.467 --> 11:56.434

11:56.534 --> 11:59.534
UH, HM.

11:59.634 --> 12:02.534
OKAY, WELL, THEY ALL SEEM TO
STEM FROM ONE ORIGINAL MUTANT.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.767
SO I SAY WE START WITH... HIM.

FIND HER LITTLE SECRET.

SIDE, I'LL GO WEST.

YOUR BROTHER.

12:29.701 --> 12:32.367
I TOOK THE MEDALLION
AND JESSE RAN THE DNA.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.801

ACT LIKE AN OUTSIDER YOU'RE

12:35.300 --> 12:37.033
GOING TO GET TREATED
LIKE ONE, ALL RIGHT?

12:37.133 --> 12:39.100
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL US YOU
WERE LOOKING FOR YOUR TWIN?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.334
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SO DAMNED SECRETIVE?

12:40.434 --> 12:42.667
BECAUSE HE'S SICK, ALL RIGHT?

12:42.767 --> 12:44.367
LEO ISN'T STABLE.

12:44.467 --> 12:47.734
SOMETIMES HE LOSES HIMSELF
AND HE BECOMES DANGEROUS
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.100
WE COULD'VE HELPED YOU FIND HIM.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.033
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.601
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

12:51.701 --> 12:54.267
IF HE'S SO DANGEROUS, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS ALONE.

12:54.367 --> 12:56.634
TRUST ME, I KNOW HOW TO
HANDLE MY OWN BROTHER.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.467
<i>LET GO!</i>

12:59.567 --> 13:01.667
GET OFF OF ME!

13:03.534 --> 13:05.267
HEY!

13:06.834 --> 13:08.801
LET HIM GO!

13:11.200 --> 13:13.300
LEO, WAIT!

13:13.400 --> 13:15.634
YOU CAN'T KEEP
RUNNING LIKE THIS.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.534
I'M NOT GOING BACK, LEXA.

13:17.634 --> 13:19.701
JUST STAY AWAY.

13:19.801 --> 13:23.234
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO THAT.

13:23.334 --> 13:25.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:33.834 --> 13:35.701
HE'S GONE.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.400
THAT'S THE CLOSEST I'VE BEEN TO
LEO IN FOUR YEARS.

13:43.501 --> 13:45.167
YOU SCREWED IT UP!
END OF STORY.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.234
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
YOU WERE SHOOTING HIM WITH A
TRACKER?

13:47.334 --> 13:49.901
YOU BETTER HOPE LIKE HELL JESS
CAN EXPAND THE SEARCH FIELD ON
THIS THING.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.400
HEY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
YOU'RE CHASING YOUR BROTHER

13:51.501 --> 13:53.100
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.434
HIS MUTATION'S TOO POWERFUL.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.501
HE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.067
WHEN WE WERE KIDS, HE STARTED
SWITCHING PERSONALITIES JUST

14:00.167 --> 14:02.334
TO GET THROUGH THE DAY.

14:02.434 --> 14:05.467
THEN HE LOST CONTROL AND...

14:05.567 --> 14:09.601
...HE ENDED UP IN AN
INSTITUTION RUN BY ECKHART.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.701
YEAH.

14:12.801 --> 14:16.300
WHATEVER THEY DID TO HIM
THERE MADE HIM WORSE.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.701
HE ESCAPED AND I'VE BEEN
SEARCHING EVER SINCE.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.934
STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY
THESE GUYS ARE AFTER HIM.

14:21.033 --> 14:23.634
I THINK WE FOUND OUT
THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE.

14:23.734 --> 14:26.133
CANDACE WASN'T KILLED.

14:26.234 --> 14:28.701
SHE WAS HARVESTED.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.534
AND SHE'S NOT THE FIRST.

14:30.634 --> 14:33.000
FIVE MUTANTS HAVE GONE MISSING
OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS, ALL

14:33.100 --> 14:36.868
OF THEM FOUND MINUS
AT LEAST ONE ORGAN.

14:36.968 --> 14:39.701
THEY'RE STRIPPING US FOR PARTS?

14:39.801 --> 14:41.267
WAIT, HOW COULD WE
NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?

14:41.367 --> 14:43.434
THEY WERE ALL
LISTED AS JOHN DOES.

14:43.534 --> 14:46.167
NO IDS, NO NEXT OF KIN.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.267
THAT MAKES A SICK SORT OF SENSE.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.300
THERE'S AN UNDERGROUND MARKET
FOR HUMAN ORGANS,

14:50.400 --> 14:51.567
WHY NOT MUTANTS?

14:51.667 --> 14:54.000
MORE EFFICIENT HEARTS,
STRONGER LUNGS...

14:54.100 --> 14:56.000
LIKE MY BROTHER.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.033
HIS WHOLE MUTATION IS ABOUT
ADAPTING INTO NEW PEOPLE.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.667
HE'D BE A UNIVERSAL DONOR.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.834
HE'S WORTH A MINT
TO THESE PEOPLE.

15:02.934 --> 15:04.167
NOW, LISTEN, DON'T WORRY.

15:04.267 --> 15:05.834
WE STILL HAVE THE TRACKER.

15:05.934 --> 15:09.567
WHICH MEANS WE'RE STILL
THREE STEPS AHEAD OF
WHOEVER'S AFTER HIM.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.567
THEY BETTER PRAY
IT STAYS THAT WAY.

15:20.501 --> 15:23.400
AHH...

15:27.968 --> 15:29.901
AHHH...

15:38.467 --> 15:39.601
REPORT.

15:39.701 --> 15:42.267
WE GOT CLOSE TO PIERCE AGAIN.

15:42.367 --> 15:44.434
BUT THE SISTER INTERVENED.

15:44.534 --> 15:45.234
LEXA.

15:45.334 --> 15:49.067
SHH. DOWN, BOY.

15:49.167 --> 15:51.501
OH, YEAH...

15:51.601 --> 15:52.767
YEAH!

15:52.868 --> 15:53.634
COME ON.

15:53.734 --> 15:56.467
AGH! <LAUGHS>

15:56.567 --> 15:59.601
YEAH, I'VE INTERVENED
WITH LEXA A FEW TIMES MYSELF.

15:59.701 --> 16:05.300
HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
<LAUGHS>

16:05.400 --> 16:12.534
<COUGHS>

16:16.000 --> 16:22.400
OH... OH... AH...

16:22.501 --> 16:23.901
GO ON.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.133
SHE HIT HIM WITH SOMETHING.

16:26.234 --> 16:28.300
IT CAME FROM A GUN.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.100
LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

16:33.634 --> 16:37.067
ALRIGHT.

16:46.133 --> 16:48.701
HM. <LAUGHS>

16:48.801 --> 16:51.934
CLEVER LEXA.

16:52.033 --> 16:53.634
ECKHART HAD THIS MADE SPECIAL.

16:53.734 --> 16:56.667
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.100
SMILE, BAIN.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.099
LEXA JUST HANDED US HER
BROTHER ON A PLATTER.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.934
ANYTHING?

17:18.032 --> 17:20.534
NO. I'M STILL TRYING TO LINK THE
CHIP UP TO OUR COMPUTER.

17:20.634 --> 17:22.300
YOU KNOW, THIS TRACKER'S
FREAKIN' GENIUS, BY THE WAY.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.733
IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STICK TO
LEO THROUGH ALL OF HIS ALTERS.

17:24.834 --> 17:29.367
YEAH, IT'S AN OLD GSA PROTOTYPE
BUILT FOR MOLECULARS.

17:29.467 --> 17:32.534
I FIGURED ECKHART OWED ME A
RETIREMENT GIFT WHEN I LEFT.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.033
<LAUGHS>

17:35.133 --> 17:38.801
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND
LEO THE OTHER NIGHT, ANYWAY?

17:38.901 --> 17:40.601
THE DOMINION.

17:40.701 --> 17:44.000
IT'S PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.968
THE ARRANGEMENT.

17:46.067 --> 17:49.434
WHAT, YOU COME BACK TO MUTANT X
AND CLEAN UP AFTER ADAM...

17:49.534 --> 17:53.067
AND THE DOMINION HELPS
YOU FIND YOUR BROTHER?

17:53.167 --> 17:55.901
YEAH.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.767
YOU THINK IT'S WRONG
WHAT I'M DOING?

18:00.868 --> 18:03.400
CHASING HIM LIKE THIS?

18:03.501 --> 18:05.534
I THINK THAT YOU LOVE HIM.

18:05.634 --> 18:08.701
I THINK THAT NOTHING
WRONG CAN COME OF THAT.

18:08.801 --> 18:09.801
JUST HANG IN THERE.

18:09.901 --> 18:12.601
I'LL GET A LOCK ON LEO SOON.

18:26.701 --> 18:27.901
YOU AVOIDING ME?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.133
IF I SAY YES, WILL YOU GO AWAY?

18:30.234 --> 18:33.434
SMART ASS.

18:33.534 --> 18:34.634
HERE.

18:34.734 --> 18:37.234
THE HOSPITAL WANTS
YOU TO SIGN THESE.

18:37.334 --> 18:38.400
I DON'T KNOW...

18:38.501 --> 18:40.267
HEY, I CHECKED THIS
ECKHART GUY OUT.

18:40.367 --> 18:41.667
HE RUNS THE COMPANY
THAT CREATED US.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.734
HE SWEARS HIS
DOCTORS CAN HELP YOU.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.467
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME.

18:45.567 --> 18:47.300
LAST MONTH YOU DISAPPEARED
FOR THREE WEEKS.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.701
YOU STILL CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE.

18:48.801 --> 18:49.734
WE CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

18:49.834 --> 18:50.834
WE CAN BARELY AFFORD TO EAT.

18:50.934 --> 18:52.334
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO AFFORD DOCTORS?

18:52.434 --> 18:54.367
ECKHART SAYS HE'LL
DO IT FOR FREE...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.334
IF I AGREE TO WORK FOR HIM.

18:56.434 --> 18:57.934
I DON'T KNOW, LEX.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.968
YOU KNOW HOW FREAKED OUT I
GET WHEN I'M ALONE TOO LONG.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.667
I KNOW.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.767
SO, THEN, JUST REMEMBER WHAT
MOM USED TO SAY WHEN YOU USED

19:04.868 --> 19:06.834
TO HAVE YOUR NIGHTMARES.

19:06.934 --> 19:09.400
"FOCUS ON ONE GOOD THING."

19:09.501 --> 19:12.400
YOU KNOW, A FAVOURITE
MEMORY, OR A PLACE...

19:12.501 --> 19:16.334
WHAT IF ALL I WANT TO
FOCUS ON IS GETTING OUT?

19:16.434 --> 19:18.234
DO THIS FOR ME.

19:18.334 --> 19:20.601
I WOULD NEVER LET
ANYBODY HURT YOU.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.133
YOU KNOW THAT.

19:23.234 --> 19:24.501
PROMISE?

19:24.601 --> 19:28.033
PROMISE.

19:33.467 --> 19:39.868
[BEEPS]

19:39.968 --> 19:40.934
TELL ME YOU GOT HIM.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.434
I GOT HIM.

19:42.534 --> 19:45.367
LET'S GO.

20:07.734 --> 20:16.701
[BEEPS]

20:16.801 --> 20:20.033
I CAN ALMOST HEAR THE
WHEELS IN YOUR HEAD TURNING.

20:20.133 --> 20:21.767
WHAT'S UP?

20:21.868 --> 20:26.534
I JUST CAN'T SHAKE THE
FEELING THAT LEXA'S HIDING
SOMETHING FROM US.

20:26.634 --> 20:27.901
TOO HARD ON HER.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.834
WELL, GOOD - BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO SOFT.

20:31.934 --> 20:33.167
[BEEPS BREAKUP]

20:33.267 --> 20:34.133
UH OH.

20:34.234 --> 20:34.968
COME ON, COME ON.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.667
WHERE'D YOU GO?

20:37.767 --> 20:39.434
WE'RE AT THE LAST
COORDINATES, JESS.

20:39.534 --> 20:40.901
THERE'S NO SIGN OF LEO.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.767
YEAH, I GOT SOME BAD
NEWS: HE'S OFF THE GRID.

20:42.868 --> 20:44.701
HE WAS READING ONE MINUTE
AND DISAPPEARED THE NEXT.

20:44.801 --> 20:46.467
WELL, HE COULDN'T
HAVE JUST VANISHED.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.000
NO, HE COULDN'T HAVE.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.300
HE'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE
HIS SIGNAL CAN'T BE READ.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.868
UH, DEEP UNDERGROUND,
SURROUNDED BY STEEL...

20:52.968 --> 20:54.801
UH...

20:54.901 --> 20:57.267
HOW ABOUT BOTH?

21:05.300 --> 21:08.000
SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK LEO'S
DOWN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.000
THIS IS WHERE HE USED TO HIDE
AS A KID, WHEN HE WANTED
TO BE ALONE.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.200
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?

21:12.300 --> 21:13.601
YOU NEVER MENTION THEM.

21:13.701 --> 21:17.067
WELL, THEY DON'T
DESERVE TO BE MENTIONED.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.968
SOUNDED BITTER, DIDN'T IT?

21:19.067 --> 21:21.033
JUST A LITTLE.

21:21.133 --> 21:22.634
THEY WERE ARMY INTELLIGENCE.

21:22.734 --> 21:26.968
THEY VOLUNTEERED FOR A
MILITARY FERTILITY PROJECT.

21:27.067 --> 21:28.868
LET ME GUESS.
RUN BY GENOMEX.

21:28.968 --> 21:30.934
YOU GOT IT.

21:31.033 --> 21:33.567
WE WERE A NORMAL LITTLE
FAMILY, AS FAR AS I KNEW.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.234
THEN LEO AND I SHOWED
OUR MUTATIONS, AND WHAM!

21:36.334 --> 21:39.400
THE BRASS ORDERED MY
PARENTS TO HAND US OVER.

21:39.501 --> 21:40.834
AND THEY DID?

21:40.934 --> 21:42.901
SWEET, HUH?

21:43.000 --> 21:48.234
UNTIL WE WERE FOURTEEN WE WERE
RAISED IN A MILITARY FACILITY.

21:48.334 --> 21:51.501
THEN LEO STARTED TO LOSE CONTROL
AND I HAD TO LEAVE TO FIND HELP.

21:51.601 --> 21:54.300
SO THEN WHY DOESN'T
LEO TRUST YOU?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.767
I TOLD YOU HE WAS TRAPPED IN
ECKHART'S HOSPITAL, RIGHT?

21:56.868 --> 21:58.734
YEAH.

21:58.834 --> 22:03.267
WELL, I'M THE ONE
WHO PUT HIM IN THERE.

22:03.367 --> 22:07.901
HE SWORE HE'D HELP LEO.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.834
THAT WAS BACK WHEN I
USED TO TRUST PEOPLE.

22:10.934 --> 22:12.300
SORRY, LEX.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.267
NOT AS SORRY AS I AM.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.901
<CELL PHONE RINGS>

22:16.000 --> 22:17.567
HELLO?

22:17.667 --> 22:18.901
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.133
LEO, WHERE ARE YOU?

22:20.234 --> 22:21.467
HEY, JESS. WE MADE CONTACT.

22:21.567 --> 22:22.567
CAN YOU TRACK US FROM DOWN HERE?

22:22.667 --> 22:24.734
<i>SEE WHAT I CAN DO.</i>

22:26.067 --> 22:27.901
CALL THEM OFF, LEXA.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.601
<i>WHO?</i>

22:29.701 --> 22:31.667
COME ON, THE MEN
THAT KILLED CANDACE!

22:31.767 --> 22:34.968
THEY'RE FOLLOWING ME SOMEHOW,
EVEN THROUGH MY SHIFTS.

22:35.067 --> 22:37.434
WHAT DID YOU DO?

22:37.534 --> 22:40.067
HIT YOU WITH A TRACKER.

22:40.167 --> 22:41.534
WHAT?

22:41.634 --> 22:42.767
LEO, I HAD NO CHOICE.

22:42.868 --> 22:44.334
LOOK, JUST STAY
UNDERGROUND, OKAY?

22:44.434 --> 22:45.601
THEY CAN'T FIND YOU THAT WAY.

22:45.701 --> 22:47.667
TELL ME WHERE YOU
ARE AND I'LL...

22:47.767 --> 22:49.701
LEO?

22:49.801 --> 22:51.868
LE...

22:56.567 --> 22:57.834
OKAY, YOU GUYS,
I GOT A FIX ON HIM.

22:57.934 --> 22:58.934
HE'S IN THE SEWERS.

22:59.033 --> 23:02.734
HE'S... WEST OF YOU.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.901
WAIT A MINUTE.

23:10.901 --> 23:13.701
WHERE DID HE GO?

23:14.434 --> 23:16.767
HERE.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.767
I FIGURED IF THESE GUYS CAN
TRACK LEO'S SIGNAL,

23:57.868 --> 23:59.868
THEN THEY
MUST BE EX-GSA.

23:59.968 --> 24:01.734
MAKES SENSE.

24:01.834 --> 24:04.634
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
MOTEL SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT'S
BUGGING ME.

24:04.734 --> 24:08.467
NOW, THERE'S
NO CLEAR SHOT OF THE KILLER'S
FACE, BUT THERE IS THIS.

24:10.434 --> 24:11.801
NICE TAT.

24:11.901 --> 24:14.300
YEAH. IT'S EVEN NICER
WHEN YOU CAN TRACE IT.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.534
WATCH.

24:23.267 --> 24:26.300
ARRESTS FOR ASSAULT, ATTEMPTED
MURDER, HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.000
UH HUH.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.200
SWEET GUY.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.067
YEAH. WHERE'S THE GSA
CONNECTION?

24:30.167 --> 24:34.267
WELL, BAIN WAS LAST
RELEASED SIX MONTHS AGO.

24:34.367 --> 24:36.234
BEFORE THE FIRST KILLING.

24:36.334 --> 24:39.534
CHECK OUT WHO POSTED HIS BAIL.

24:39.634 --> 24:41.434
CHARLES CARTER.

24:41.534 --> 24:44.234
<i>TELEKINETIC, EX-GSA.</i>

24:44.334 --> 24:46.601
LED ONE OF ECKHART'S
MUTANT APPREHENSION TEAMS.

24:46.701 --> 24:49.067
SOUNDS LIKE HE ADDED A
NEW TWIST TO HIS OLD JOB.

24:49.167 --> 24:51.133
ARE YOU SURE HE'S BEHIND
THESE ORGAN THEFTS?

24:51.234 --> 24:52.133
WISH HE WASN'T.

24:52.234 --> 24:54.167
A GUY LIKE THIS
AIN'T GONNA STOP.

24:54.267 --> 24:56.267
LOOK, I'M GONNA SCORE SOME
TRANSPORTATION, SO IF YOU GET A

24:56.367 --> 24:59.734
LEAD ON LEO OR THIS
CARTER GUY, LET US KNOW.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.234
<i>WILL DO.</i>

25:01.334 --> 25:03.400
HEY...

25:06.534 --> 25:07.767
LISTEN, YOU'RE EX-GSA.

25:07.868 --> 25:09.567
YOU MUST'VE WORKED
WITH THIS CARTER GUY.

25:09.667 --> 25:11.167
HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE COULD BE?

25:11.267 --> 25:12.868
NOT ANYMORE.

25:12.968 --> 25:15.300
HE WAS USEFUL TO ME... ONCE.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.467
LOOK, I KNOW THIS
LOOKS BAD, ALL RIGHT?

25:17.567 --> 25:20.267
BUT WE'LL FIND YOUR
BROTHER BEFORE HE DOES.

25:20.367 --> 25:22.200
CARTER'S NOT OUR BIGGEST
PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

25:22.300 --> 25:23.968
LEO SOUNDED REALLY SCARED.

25:24.067 --> 25:25.100
YEAH, OF COURSE HE'S SCARED.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.200
NO - YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:27.300 --> 25:29.734
STRESS BRINGS OUT THE
WORST IN MY BROTHER.

25:29.834 --> 25:32.367
LITERALLY.

25:32.467 --> 25:35.467
I CHECKED OUT SOME OF
LEO'S OTHER PERSONALITIES.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.000
MEET TROY.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.667
LEO'S NASTIEST ALTER.

25:39.767 --> 25:43.634
IT WAS TROY THAT BROKE OUT OF
ECKHART'S INSTITUTION, NOT LEO.

25:43.734 --> 25:45.901
PUT THREE GUYS IN A COMA,
NEARLY LEVELLED THE BUILDING.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.400
OH, MAN.

25:48.501 --> 25:50.901
IMAGINE BEING
RELATED TO THAT GUY.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.901
WHEN LEXA
SAID HER BROTHER WAS DANGEROUS
SHE WASN'T KIDDING, HUH?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.467
YEAH, WELL, IF YOU WENT
THROUGH WHAT LEO DID

25:55.567 --> 25:57.300
AFTER HIS OWN SISTER
LOCKED HIM IN THAT HELL HOLE

25:57.400 --> 25:59.567
YOU MIGHTA COME OUT WRONG, TOO.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.968
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:01.067 --> 26:03.300
WELL, THE ONLY REASON LEO
CREATED TROY WAS TO DEAL WITH

26:03.400 --> 26:06.367
THE STUFF THAT ECKHART'S
DOCTORS WERE DOING TO HIM.

26:06.467 --> 26:10.167
SENSORY DEPRIVATION,
ELECTROSHOCK,

26:10.267 --> 26:11.801
SLOW STAGE DROWNING...

26:11.901 --> 26:13.200
OH, MAN.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.801
SO THEY FIGURED IF THEY
SUBJECTED LEO TO ENOUGH
TORTURE...

26:15.901 --> 26:18.868
HE'D SHIFT INTO SOMETHING
EXTRA-DANGEROUS OUT OF SHEER
SELF-DEFENCE.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.267
WELL, LOOKS LIKE IT WORKED.

26:20.367 --> 26:22.934
UNFORTUNATELY,
ONCE TROY'S OUT OF THE BOX

26:23.033 --> 26:24.434
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO GO BACK IN.

26:24.534 --> 26:26.567
AH.

26:26.667 --> 26:29.133
I KNEW LEX WAS KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM US.

26:29.234 --> 26:32.100
CAN YOU BLAME HER?

26:35.400 --> 26:37.167
UGH...

26:37.267 --> 26:38.667
I...

26:38.767 --> 26:41.467
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

26:41.567 --> 26:44.067
THE TRACKER LOST HIM.

26:44.167 --> 26:49.801
OH, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
YOU AND YOUR TEAM LOST HIM...

26:49.901 --> 26:50.934
AGAIN?

26:51.033 --> 26:52.667
NO.

26:52.767 --> 26:56.067
THE TRACKER.

26:56.167 --> 26:58.367
RELAX.

26:58.467 --> 27:01.534
IT'S NOT AS IF I'M
COMPLETELY HEARTLESS.

27:01.634 --> 27:06.167
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
MY HEART ANYMORE, IS IT?

27:06.267 --> 27:12.467
[BEEPS]

27:12.567 --> 27:14.167
AGH...!

27:14.267 --> 27:15.501
HELLO?

27:15.601 --> 27:17.334
GO!

27:17.434 --> 27:18.434
HE'S WEST ON DEWEY.

27:18.534 --> 27:20.601
BAIN!

27:20.701 --> 27:24.400
LOSE HIM THIS TIME AND THE
NEXT HEART I TAKE IS YOURS.

27:24.501 --> 27:27.400
MOVE!

27:28.968 --> 27:31.534
RUN!

27:33.634 --> 27:36.767
SHAL, COME HERE.

27:36.868 --> 27:38.534
OKAY, WE GOT IGNITION, PEOPLE.

27:38.634 --> 27:40.167
LEO'S SIGNAL IS LIVE AND ONLINE.

27:40.267 --> 27:41.934
HE'S HEADING WEST ON DEWEY.

27:42.033 --> 27:44.367
<i>WE'RE ON IT.</i>

27:53.968 --> 28:09.801
[BEEPS]

28:29.400 --> 28:35.634
[BEEPS]

28:37.200 --> 28:42.501
UGH...

28:42.601 --> 28:45.367
AGH!

28:45.467 --> 28:46.634
<i>ALL RIGHT. HE'S
DEFINITELY STOPPED.</i>

28:46.734 --> 28:50.367
<i>STILL READING HIM
AT 44 RICHMOND.</i>

28:51.334 --> 28:53.701
[BEEPS]

28:59.000 --> 29:00.133
WE'RE HEADING INSIDE NOW.

29:00.234 --> 29:02.767
CARTER'S TEAM'S ALREADY HERE.

29:02.868 --> 29:05.901
I'M CALLING UP THE
BUILDING PLANS.

29:16.033 --> 29:21.834
[GUNSHOTS]
NO!

29:32.834 --> 29:34.067
LEXA, DON'T...

29:34.167 --> 29:36.334
NO, LEO!

29:45.367 --> 29:48.901
MY GOD.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.734
WE FOUND YOUR TRACKER.

29:51.834 --> 29:54.133
BUT YOU SAID YOUR
BROTHER WASN'T VIOLENT.

29:54.234 --> 29:55.434
HE ISN'T.

29:55.534 --> 30:02.367
<CELL PHONE RINGS>

30:03.934 --> 30:05.701
HELLO, LEXA.

30:05.801 --> 30:08.334
I MISSED YOU.

30:14.234 --> 30:15.968
YOU'RE SUCH A HARD
GIRL TO SHOP FOR.

30:16.067 --> 30:18.367
<i>I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO
YOU, I WANT TO TALK TO LEO.</i>

30:18.467 --> 30:19.567
<i>SORRY.</i>

30:19.667 --> 30:21.200
CAN'T HAPPEN UNLESS I LET HIM.

30:21.300 --> 30:23.434
YOU KNOW THAT.

30:23.534 --> 30:24.567
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

30:24.667 --> 30:26.400
<i>I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU.</i>

30:26.501 --> 30:32.067
THAT LITTLE
MEAT PUPPET IN THE CHAIR
GAVE ME EVERYTHING I NEEDED.

30:32.167 --> 30:34.701
<i>I WISH LEO COULD SEE
YOU THE WAY I DO.</i>

30:34.801 --> 30:36.234
YOU'VE GOT HIM CONVINCED
YOU'RE SO STRONG.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.167
BUT WHO HAVE YOU EVER
PROTECTED HIM FROM?

30:38.267 --> 30:41.300
<i>NOT MOM OR DAD -
NOT THE DOCTORS.</i>

30:41.400 --> 30:42.634
I PROTECT HIM FROM YOU.

30:42.734 --> 30:47.934
IF YOU HADN'T LET HIM DOWN
I WOULDN'T EVEN EXIST.

30:48.033 --> 30:51.901
<i>IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO DO WHAT
IT TAKES TO END THIS... CARTER,</i>

30:52.033 --> 30:54.100
THEN I WILL.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.801
NO. NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:55.901 --> 30:57.234
WE NEED TO STOP
HIM. LET ME HELP.

30:57.334 --> 31:02.734
<LAUGHS> NICE TRY, LEXA.

31:02.834 --> 31:05.434
BUT I'M NOT THE
FOOL IN THIS FAMILY.

31:05.534 --> 31:07.701
TROY, DON'T DO THIS.

31:07.801 --> 31:09.267
TROY...

31:09.367 --> 31:11.000
TROY...?

31:13.934 --> 31:14.901
WHAT'S WRONG?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.133
HE'S GOING AFTER CARTER.

31:21.834 --> 31:24.968
ALL RIGHT, WHERE IS HE?

31:25.067 --> 31:27.501
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?

31:27.601 --> 31:31.033
I CAN THINK OF ONE GOOD REASON.

31:40.534 --> 31:45.534
<SCREAMS>

31:45.634 --> 31:47.167
YOU'RE LOSING IT.

31:47.267 --> 31:49.567
NO, I'M LOSING LEO.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:49.667 --> 31:52.334
THE LONGER I LET TROY
CONTROL HIM THE MORE
DOMINANT HE BECOMES.

31:52.434 --> 31:54.601
I ONLY HAVE A SMALL WINDOW
TO TRY AND REACH MY BROTHER.

31:54.701 --> 31:55.801
OKAY, TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

31:55.901 --> 31:57.634
I NEED YOU TO BACK OFF!

31:57.734 --> 31:59.334
IF YOU COME AFTER TROY HE'LL
CONSIDER YOU A THREAT.

31:59.434 --> 32:01.567
I CAN'T HANDLE
THAT COMPLICATION.

32:01.667 --> 32:02.934
I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GO IN THERE ALONE.

32:03.033 --> 32:05.667
WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.467
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

32:07.567 --> 32:08.901
YEAH? HOW 'BOUT THIS?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.734
AGH!

32:32.834 --> 32:36.234
HI, HONEY. I'M HOME.

32:46.267 --> 32:47.734
WE'LL REACH BRENNAN IN FIVE.

32:47.834 --> 32:51.200
IT'S ANOTHER TEN TO GET TO LEXA.

32:54.767 --> 32:57.667
JESS, YOU KNOW HOW
PROTECTIVE LEXA IS OVER LEO?

32:57.767 --> 32:58.868
YEAH, I CAUGHT THAT.

32:58.968 --> 33:01.400
WELL, TROY IS LEO.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.133
AT LEAST, PART OF HIM, ANYWAY.

33:03.234 --> 33:06.234
IF HE ATTACKS HER, HOW HARD
DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING TO
FIGHT BACK?

33:06.334 --> 33:07.434
AGH!

33:07.534 --> 33:12.234
OOH, AGH...! WELL, THIS
BRINGS BACK GOOD MEMORIES.

33:12.334 --> 33:15.200
BUT I PREFERRED IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

33:19.667 --> 33:22.534
C'MON.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.267
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU SO VANILLA?

33:25.367 --> 33:31.133
ORGAN DEALING IS LOW,
CARTER, EVEN FOR YOU.

33:31.234 --> 33:33.300
WELL, WHAT CAN I SAY?

33:33.400 --> 33:35.400
PEOPLE PAY BIG MONEY
FOR BABOON PARTS.

33:35.501 --> 33:38.367
YOU'D BE AMAZED AT WHAT THEY
PAY FOR SOMETHING MORE EVOLVED.

33:38.467 --> 33:39.968
I GUESS YOU'RE SAFE, THEN.

33:40.067 --> 33:41.267
RELAX.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.934
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE NO
LOYALTY TO OUR PEOPLE.

33:44.033 --> 33:47.667
I PICK FROM THE DREGS, CULL THE
HERD - THE WEAK, THE FREAKS.

33:47.767 --> 33:50.200
YOU KNOW, LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.067
OH, YOU STILL BLAME ME FOR HIM.

33:52.167 --> 33:54.367
YOU WERE ECKHART'S
HEAD OF SECURITY.

33:54.467 --> 33:58.167
YOU KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
TO HIM THE WHOLE TIME WE
WERE TOGETHER.

33:58.267 --> 33:59.534
YOU LIED TO ME.

33:59.634 --> 34:00.934
WELL, I HAD TO, BABY.

34:01.033 --> 34:04.100
IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD
KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF.

34:04.200 --> 34:09.067
AGH!

34:09.167 --> 34:13.434
<LAUGHS>

34:15.833 --> 34:17.400
HOW HARD DID YOU REALLY
LOOK INTO WHAT ECKHART

34:17.501 --> 34:20.199
WAS DOING TO YOUR BROTHER?

34:20.300 --> 34:22.000
AND HOW MUCH OF YOU WAS JUST
GLAD HE WAS FINALLY

34:22.100 --> 34:23.601
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM?

34:23.701 --> 34:26.300
AGH...!

34:26.400 --> 34:27.701
HERE'S THE DEAL:

34:27.801 --> 34:31.567
LEAVE WITH ME NOW,
STOP PURSUING MY BROTHER.

34:31.667 --> 34:34.067
AND I PROMISE I'LL ONLY
DAMAGE YOUR NON-VITAL ORGANS.

34:34.167 --> 34:35.434
AGH!

34:35.534 --> 34:40.000
AGH...

34:40.100 --> 34:43.234
OH...! WELL, THAT
COULD BE A PROBLEM.

34:43.333 --> 34:47.132
LOOK...

34:47.234 --> 34:50.766
I TOOK SOME BULLETS A WHILE AGO.

34:50.868 --> 34:57.132
MY BODY'S ALREADY REJECTED
THE SECOND TRANSPLANT.

34:58.267 --> 35:01.501
I NEED YOUR BROTHER'S HEART.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.801
IT'S ALMOST POETIC.

35:03.901 --> 35:08.434
THE ONE DONOR THAT'S
A GUARANTEED MATCH IS
YOUR TWIN BROTHER.

35:08.534 --> 35:12.767
SO AFTER THE OPERATION, I'LL
ALWAYS HAVE A PIECE OF YOU...

35:12.868 --> 35:14.234
RIGHT HERE.

35:14.334 --> 35:16.601
YOU WANT A PIECE, CARTER?

35:16.701 --> 35:19.234
YOU COME AND GET IT.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.634
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
LEXA BEAT ME TO IT.

35:28.734 --> 35:31.634
VERY RUDE OF HER.

35:31.734 --> 35:33.868
WELL, YOU KNOW LEXA.

35:33.968 --> 35:36.367
ALWAYS WAS HEADSTRONG.

35:41.434 --> 35:42.868
COME ON, GIVE THIS UP, TROY.

35:42.968 --> 35:44.367
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

35:44.467 --> 35:47.634
SHAME I CAN'T SAY THE SAME.

35:51.434 --> 35:52.400
CARTER!

35:52.501 --> 35:54.601
YOU GET HIM.
I'LL FIND LEX.

35:57.033 --> 35:59.100
UGH!

36:01.501 --> 36:03.501
HEY, UGLY!

36:03.601 --> 36:05.934
WHAT? YOUR MOMMA DIDN'T TEACH
YOU NOT TO PICK ON YOUR SISTER?

36:06.033 --> 36:08.467
BRENNAN, GET OUT OF HERE!

36:08.567 --> 36:24.567
<GRUNTING>

36:36.400 --> 36:38.000
NO.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.534
YOU HONESTLY THINK
I WON'T KILL YOU?

36:40.634 --> 36:41.934
THOSE DOCTORS LIED TO ME, LEO.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.234
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP.

36:43.334 --> 36:44.534
BY TORTURING HIM?

36:44.634 --> 36:46.467
BY TEACHING HIM
NEW LEVELS OF PAIN?

36:46.567 --> 36:48.534
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? YOU
WERE FALLING APART, LEO.

36:48.634 --> 36:52.601
STOP CALLING ME THAT!

36:52.701 --> 36:54.567
THE ONLY THING THAT'S
EVER MATTERED TO ME IS

36:54.667 --> 36:56.968
SOMEWHERE INSIDE YOU.
YOU STILL KNOW THAT.

36:57.067 --> 36:58.501
TOUCHING.

36:58.601 --> 37:01.300
BUT HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

37:08.868 --> 37:11.234
AGH!

37:11.334 --> 37:13.534
GOING SOMEWHERE?

37:17.267 --> 37:19.033
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE YOU APART...

37:19.133 --> 37:20.334
PIECE BY PIECE.

37:20.434 --> 37:22.100
YOU WOULDN'T GET MUCH FOR HIM.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.534
ANTl-REJECTION PILLS, HUH?

37:24.634 --> 37:26.901
WITHOUT THESE THAT STOLEN
HEART OF YOURS WOULD JUST...

37:27.000 --> 37:28.534
STOP, WOULDN'T IT?

37:28.634 --> 37:33.400
AGH...!

37:33.501 --> 37:36.634
<LAUGHS>
I'M DYING ALREADY.

37:36.734 --> 37:41.534
WHAT'S THE WORST YOU CAN DO?

37:41.634 --> 37:46.734
WE CAN LET YOU DIE SLOW AND
ALONE, JUST LIKE YOUR VICTIMS.

37:46.834 --> 37:50.767
AGH!

37:50.868 --> 38:02.767
<GASPING>

38:06.067 --> 38:08.501
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PLAY A GAME, LEXA?

38:08.601 --> 38:11.200
USED TO PLAY GAMES WITH
LEO INSIDE THAT HOSPITAL.

38:11.300 --> 38:14.634
THEY'D GIVEN HIM
KITTENS, TWO OF THEM.

38:14.734 --> 38:16.734
THEN THEY'D KILL
THEM IN FRONT OF HIM.

38:16.834 --> 38:19.367
AND MAKE HIM WATCH.

38:19.467 --> 38:21.033
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MORE YOU WANT FROM ME.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.334
RIGHT NOW?

38:22.434 --> 38:26.400
I WANT IT TO BE
YOUR TURN TO WATCH.

38:29.634 --> 38:33.067
TROY, DON'T DO THIS.

38:33.167 --> 38:34.334
NO!

38:34.434 --> 38:37.200
AGH...!

38:48.067 --> 38:49.734
OH, MY GOD, LEE... LEE...

38:49.834 --> 38:51.701
NO, DON'T MOVE.
DON'T MOVE, LEE.

38:51.801 --> 38:53.467
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

38:53.567 --> 38:54.934
DID I HURT YOU?

38:55.033 --> 38:57.767
NO. I'M FINE. I'M FINE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

38:57.868 --> 39:02.400
LEX, LISTEN, I NEVER
BLAMED YOU, OKAY?

39:02.501 --> 39:04.667
I WAS RUNNING TO PROTECT YOU.

39:04.767 --> 39:07.334
FROM WHAT?

39:07.434 --> 39:09.701
THIS.

39:09.801 --> 39:12.033
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL
I VISITED YOU EVERY WEEK.

39:12.133 --> 39:14.834
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

39:14.934 --> 39:16.934
BECAUSE...

39:17.033 --> 39:22.567
THEY TOLD ME IF I DID THEY'D
DO THE SAME THINGS TO YOU.

39:22.667 --> 39:23.968
STAY WITH ME, OKAY?

39:24.067 --> 39:25.400
I DON'T WANT TO DIE ALONE.

39:25.501 --> 39:26.667
NO. NO, DON'T
YOU TALK LIKE THAT.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.634
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, OKAY?

39:28.734 --> 39:31.167
JUST... JUST DO LIKE WE DID AS
KIDS, OKAY?

39:31.267 --> 39:32.267
JUST THINK OF ONE GOOD...

39:32.367 --> 39:35.133
ONE GOOD THING.

39:35.234 --> 39:36.267
ONE...

39:36.367 --> 39:39.901
MY ONE GOOD THING IS YOU.

39:42.234 --> 39:43.801
NO.

39:43.901 --> 39:46.167
NO.

39:46.267 --> 39:47.801
<CRYING>

39:47.901 --> 39:50.701
NO, NO...

39:50.801 --> 39:56.067
LEO.

40:06.834 --> 40:07.934
[KNOCK]

40:08.033 --> 40:10.067
WHAT.

40:19.267 --> 40:22.734
SHAL THOUGHT YOU'D
WANT THIS BACK.

40:22.834 --> 40:26.434
SHE HAD IT FIXED.

40:31.968 --> 40:34.767
CASTOR AND POLLUX.

40:34.868 --> 40:36.968
WHAT?

40:37.067 --> 40:39.667
ON THE NECKLACE.

40:39.767 --> 40:42.667
IT'S A GREEK MYTH.

40:42.767 --> 40:47.467
CASTOR GAVE UP IMMORTALITY
TO SAVE HIS TWIN.

40:47.567 --> 40:49.767
THEY SPENT THE REST OF ETERNITY
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL AS

40:49.868 --> 40:53.267
PART OF THE BARGAIN.

40:53.367 --> 40:57.934
I GAVE THIS TO HIM WHEN HE
STARTED LOSING CONTROL.

40:58.033 --> 41:01.968
SAID IF HE WORE IT I'D
ALWAYS BE ABLE TO FIND HIM.

41:04.501 --> 41:07.200
KINDA WHAT HAPPENED.

41:07.300 --> 41:13.434
THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU AND I
NEED TO BE CLEAR ON, BRENNAN.

41:13.534 --> 41:16.234
ONE:

41:16.334 --> 41:17.734
I APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU DID

41:17.834 --> 41:22.300
TO TRY TO HELP ME
WITH MY BROTHER.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.934
AND TWO?

41:25.033 --> 41:29.234
I TOLD YOU NOT TO COME AFTER ME.

41:29.334 --> 41:31.200
AND PART OF ME KNOWS IT
WOULD'VE ENDED THE SAME EVEN IF

41:31.300 --> 41:34.934
YOU WOULD'VE DONE
WHAT I'D ASKED.

41:35.033 --> 41:36.267
AND THE REST OF YOU?

41:36.367 --> 41:37.968
THE REST OF ME KNOWS IT'S
BECAUSE OF YOU I HAD TO

41:38.067 --> 41:40.267
MAKE A CHOICE, AND NOW MY
BROTHER IS DEAD.

41:40.367 --> 41:48.067
AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE IN
THE SAME ROOM WITH YOU RIGHT
NOW, OKAY?
