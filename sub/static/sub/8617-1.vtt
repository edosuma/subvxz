You know, if this is your
documentary, you're doing a bad job.

01:40.815 --> 01:43.181
'Cause you're catching me when I
don't want to talk about things.

01:45.887 --> 01:48.913
Set it up,
organize a time with me.

01:49.257 --> 01:51.088
Put together some
materials, e-mails,

01:51.159 --> 01:53.127
we'll get the Facebook
conversation printed out,

01:53.194 --> 01:54.718
and we'll really
talk about it.

01:55.163 --> 01:57.563
But do you want to be the subject
of this documentary or not?

01:57.632 --> 02:01.591
No, I don't.
This is about Abby.

02:02.737 --> 02:04.364
Do you want to be
the co-subject?

02:04.439 --> 02:07.738
No, I don't see why. I don't
think I'm that interesting.

02:07.809 --> 02:10.675
I'm making a documentary
about Abby through you.

02:10.745 --> 02:13.236
Can you understand that?

02:13.314 --> 02:15.748
What do you think? I'm going
to talk to Abby right now?

02:15.817 --> 02:18.183
No, I understand.
I'm just saying.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.152
<i>This is an e-mail
from Abby that I got today.</i>

04:02.723 --> 04:04.418
<i>"My snake Zoe died today. "</i>

04:04.492 --> 04:05.754
I didn't even know
she had a snake.

04:06.193 --> 04:08.627
"I kind of thought
she was sick since Sunday,

04:08.696 --> 04:10.561
"and this morning
she was almost dead.

04:10.631 --> 04:13.566
"By the time I got back from
school, she was really dead.

04:13.634 --> 04:17.832
"She didn't eat her last meal, so
now I have a pet mouse named Max.

04:17.904 --> 04:19.668
<i>"He's super cute. "</i>

04:19.740 --> 04:21.901
<i>I thought that
was really funny.</i>

04:21.976 --> 04:25.309
Such a positive way of
looking at things, you know?

04:25.379 --> 04:28.974
One pet for the next.
Circle of life.

05:23.404 --> 05:25.964
<i>Yeah.
By the light.</i>

05:29.944 --> 05:32.811
You ready? Sound levels? Everything?

05:32.880 --> 05:33.904
Yeah.

05:33.981 --> 05:39.886
Okay. Today is April 9th,
2008, and I'm about to open...

05:42.923 --> 05:46.552
I think the third
or fourth box, package,

05:46.627 --> 05:49.824
that Angela,
Abby's mom, has sent me.

05:49.897 --> 05:52.092
Let's see what we got.
I'm excited.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.391
What are
you expecting?

05:53.467 --> 05:54.627
I mean,
I know there's a couple...

05:54.702 --> 05:58.331
A couple of pastel drawings that I
really like, that I've seen already.

05:58.406 --> 06:02.968
But I think there's also some pictures
or paintings that I haven't seen.

06:03.377 --> 06:06.813
Let's open this T-shirt first.
This is her brother's band.

06:08.449 --> 06:10.246
"To Rel. ' '
Oh, this is for Rel.

06:10.785 --> 06:12.810
A little card. Do you want to
open it, Rel, or should I open it?

06:12.887 --> 06:13.911
No, you can open it.
From Abby.

06:16.824 --> 06:17.950
Go ahead and read it.

06:18.025 --> 06:19.253
I got to open it.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.225
The card.

06:32.973 --> 06:36.136
I guess this is her brother's
band. The Casualties.

06:37.078 --> 06:43.381
"To Nev. Make sure Rel wears a
brain bucket when he skateboards. "

06:43.451 --> 06:46.852
"He scares me a little.
Peace and love, Abby. "

06:46.921 --> 06:50.880
So, wear your brain bucket. All right,
now let's look at these paintings.

07:20.488 --> 07:23.889
What's the most one of
Abby's paintings has sold for?

07:38.305 --> 07:40.398
She sounds really nice,
and just normal,

07:40.474 --> 07:42.237
which is a relief, because
the first time we spoke

07:42.309 --> 07:44.971
it was just about a package
and it was short.

07:45.045 --> 07:46.774
But...

07:47.848 --> 07:52.615
Yeah, I mean, she's got, like,
a lot of kids running around.

07:52.686 --> 07:55.814
Her son was plowing. They had,
like, a foot of snow yesterday,

07:55.890 --> 07:59.291
and he knocked over a power
line that knocked into a tree.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.193
So, they had to cut down this,
like, 150-year-old maple tree.

08:02.263 --> 08:06.927
He burnt the transmission out on
the car. They didn't have power.

08:07.001 --> 08:10.835
Phones that were plugged in
got surged and fried.

08:10.905 --> 08:14.602
And she's, like,
you know, dealing with it.

08:14.675 --> 08:18.338
She must be awesome 'cause
her kids are pretty awesome,

08:20.080 --> 08:22.776
at least from Facebook.

08:24.418 --> 08:26.750
The Facebook family,
that's what we'll call them.

09:27.581 --> 09:29.776
<i>Her sister Megan is an artist,
and also a dancer,</i>

09:29.850 --> 09:32.614
but she isn't
making as much art...

09:33.053 --> 09:36.454
Or only shared
this picture with me,

09:36.523 --> 09:38.957
because I think she has
a big crush on me.

09:39.026 --> 09:42.393
So when I put that... Made that
my Facebook profile picture,

09:42.463 --> 09:45.398
<i>she really liked it
and told me how nice it was,</i>

09:45.466 --> 09:47.764
<i>and that she thought
how nice it would be</i>

09:47.835 --> 09:50.565
to put her head on my chest
and fall asleep.

09:51.171 --> 09:52.968
<i>So then she drew it, and it's
actually a beautiful drawing.</i>

09:53.040 --> 09:54.769
<i>Yeah, it is.
It's really good.</i>

09:56.110 --> 09:58.578
<i>She works as a vet,
so she likes animals a lot.</i>

09:58.646 --> 10:03.310
I like animals. I'm not a crazy
animal lover, but I do like animals.

10:03.384 --> 10:07.878
She's a musician.
I think she plays the cello,

10:07.955 --> 10:10.423
<i>maybe also the guitar,
and she sings.</i>

10:10.791 --> 10:15.421
I'm not really a musician, but I
guess you could say that we have

10:15.496 --> 10:18.397
a similarity there.
'Cause I... Whatever.

10:18.465 --> 10:19.898
She's a dancer.

10:20.534 --> 10:25.028
<i>She takes ballet, other... I
think she does belly dancing.</i>

10:25.105 --> 10:27.403
Again, not that I
do either of those,

10:27.541 --> 10:29.873
but dance is
a big part of my life.

10:37.051 --> 10:38.780
I mean...

10:38.852 --> 10:41.377
I guess I don't know
that much about her yet.

10:48.796 --> 10:49.922
Hey, Megan?

10:50.331 --> 10:52.060
Hey, it's Nev.

10:53.767 --> 10:56.201
Your voice is not at
all what I expected.

10:59.807 --> 11:02.867
No, no... It's... It's...

11:05.479 --> 11:07.845
Really, it's a terrific voice, I just...

11:07.915 --> 11:11.043
I don't know, I guess you
never really think of a voice

11:11.118 --> 11:14.747
when you only know somebody
in a certain way.

11:16.457 --> 11:18.425
I happen to think my voice
is sort of irritating.

11:20.427 --> 11:21.894
Thank you.

11:23.497 --> 11:25.488
So, if you're home now,

11:25.566 --> 11:27.261
does that mean you're, like,
at home with your mom and Abby

11:27.334 --> 11:28.323
and the whole family?

11:35.376 --> 11:38.004
She's there, and she wants
to know who you're talking to?

11:39.947 --> 11:41.778
Well, you should tell her.
I've spoken to your mom.

11:45.886 --> 11:49.822
New package from Michigan.
Really big, 35 pounds.

11:51.658 --> 11:53.956
And I'm going to check it out.
I'm really excited.

11:54.028 --> 11:56.553
I was told that they had
used paper towels to pack.

11:56.630 --> 12:00.964
Now we've got not some,
but tons of paper towels.

12:01.035 --> 12:03.299
What's the reason
for this new package?

12:03.370 --> 12:06.396
Just new paintings. I don't
know. Let's see what we got.

12:06.473 --> 12:08.737
Here we go. This is cool.

12:08.809 --> 12:14.076
This is the painting of Angela that
she did, which is actually really good.

12:14.148 --> 12:15.547
That's the mom?

12:15.616 --> 12:16.605
Yeah.

12:17.885 --> 12:19.113
Now?
Yeah.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.417
Wow.
I know.

12:21.488 --> 12:22.853
She's hot.

12:22.923 --> 12:24.413
She is very attractive.

12:24.691 --> 12:26.352
You know what I just learned?

12:26.427 --> 12:30.090
That Abby puts
a strand of her hair

12:30.164 --> 12:32.655
in every oil painting
that she does

12:32.733 --> 12:36.931
because she wants to be able
to prove that it's hers by DNA.

12:37.971 --> 12:43.273
Like, whenever, down the line.
She also spits in her watercolors.

12:44.411 --> 12:46.106
These are the prints.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.171
How many of them?
Here's the original.

12:48.916 --> 12:51.077
This is... Jesus.

12:51.151 --> 12:52.812
Well, they're
making money from them.

12:52.886 --> 12:54.945
They sold all the art,
they sold out.

12:57.791 --> 12:58.815
To local collectors.

13:01.662 --> 13:04.893
A lot of paper towels.
All right, amazing package.

13:05.299 --> 13:07.460
Okay, I'll be back.

13:13.006 --> 13:17.375
What do you think?
It's okay. I like it.

13:17.444 --> 13:19.105
Megan's singing backup vocals.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.685
This is
a really cinematic...

13:37.831 --> 13:39.196
I mean,
that's a no-brainer, right?

13:40.968 --> 13:44.404
<i>I'm not sure who posted it,
but Alex sent me a message.</i>

13:53.981 --> 13:58.475
"Why? I have no idea. I doubt
you'll appreciate it one bit. ' '

13:58.552 --> 13:59.849
Jeez.
I know.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.081
And now, this is interesting.
I don't know what this is about,

14:02.156 --> 14:05.648
but I just see that Angela,
the mom, wrote on Alex's wall,

14:06.126 --> 14:07.957
"You really need to
stay out of it, please. ' '

14:08.028 --> 14:10.053
Now, I don't know, that could be
in reference to something else,

14:10.130 --> 14:13.861
but I feel like that's
probably in reference to...

14:13.934 --> 14:16.027
I mentioned to Megan
that he had sent me a message.

14:22.042 --> 14:24.272
Last night we had a great
talk. She told me about...

14:24.344 --> 14:27.507
Did you guys know this? Chickens.
She has six chickens now.

14:27.581 --> 14:31.642
Her neighbor gave them to her
as a house-warming present.

14:31.718 --> 14:37.486
A chicken makes an egg every
day. Did you know that? Every day.

14:37.558 --> 14:40.686
Like ovulating.
They ovulate eggs.

14:40.761 --> 14:41.785
Yeah.

14:41.862 --> 14:43.625
Crazy.
Every day?

14:43.697 --> 14:45.631
Every day
a chicken makes one egg.

14:45.699 --> 14:47.667
<i>She has chickens?
She now has chickens.</i>

14:47.734 --> 14:48.723
<i>Tell us
the gifts she got.</i>

14:49.903 --> 14:51.564
<i>So, she bought a house,</i>

14:51.638 --> 14:54.766
and one of the presents was
that Abby got her a baby goat.

14:56.109 --> 14:59.601
So she's got a goat now. She
has horses that live there.

14:59.680 --> 15:04.310
<i>Part of buying the house came with
these horses that are held there,</i>

15:04.384 --> 15:06.545
<i>you know, like stables.</i>

15:11.391 --> 15:12.380
I can't.

15:15.963 --> 15:18.090
Nothing.
You don't want this.

15:19.099 --> 15:20.430
I'm pretty good.
I'm good.

15:42.956 --> 15:44.184
I'm sure he is.

15:56.003 --> 15:57.129
Bye.

16:07.514 --> 16:09.414
How long have you been
calling each other "babe"?

16:10.450 --> 16:12.213
A couple of weeks.
Two weeks maybe.

16:13.587 --> 16:16.818
So you're full-on going out? This
is a long distance relationship?

16:16.890 --> 16:19.017
No, we're not. We're not.

16:19.726 --> 16:22.854
But, you know,
if we met each other

16:24.765 --> 16:26.756
and the attraction
exists in real life,

16:26.833 --> 16:29.825
it would be, like,
instantaneous relationship.

16:32.839 --> 16:35.399
But you can't just
make out and send her home.

16:35.475 --> 16:36.533
I know.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.407
And take her virginity.

16:38.478 --> 16:41.811
Well, that's what
it comes down to.

16:41.882 --> 16:47.149
I'm going to have to
really be very careful.

16:47.220 --> 16:52.283
Because even if there
is a lot of chemistry,

16:52.926 --> 16:54.723
she does still
live in Michigan.

16:56.296 --> 17:00.392
<i>"Megan, this is the first
letter I have sent you, ever.</i>

17:00.467 --> 17:03.265
<i>"It feels a little strange
since all of our communications</i>

17:03.337 --> 17:05.896
<i>"have been
virtual up until now.</i>

17:05.972 --> 17:09.806
<i>"I made two of these pennies,
one for you and one for me.</i>

17:09.876 --> 17:12.470
<i>"You have no idea
how excited I am to meet you.</i>

17:14.948 --> 17:16.676
<i>"Yours, Nev. "</i>

18:00.360 --> 18:01.418
<i>Message.</i>

18:06.400 --> 18:09.836
Hey, Megan.
Nev, 6:00, Sunday.

18:09.903 --> 18:12.394
Yeah, I guess you just
got kicked off G-Chat.

18:12.939 --> 18:15.430
I'm leaving tomorrow
for Vail.

18:15.509 --> 18:17.943
I don't know what your schedule
is like for the next two weeks,

18:18.011 --> 18:21.242
but Rel, Henry, and I are going
to be out there till the 9th

18:21.448 --> 18:24.542
<i>for the Vail
Dance Festival, so...</i>

18:24.618 --> 18:28.213
<i>I don't know, maybe you and
your mom and Abby and Joelle</i>

18:28.288 --> 18:30.518
<i>should come out
for a weekend.</i>

18:31.224 --> 18:33.658
<i>You're like,
kind of, halfway there.</i>

18:33.727 --> 18:37.527
<i>Fly to Denver. I don't
know, it's an idea.</i>

18:37.597 --> 18:40.964
<i>So, you can call me
at the office or on my cell.</i>

18:41.034 --> 18:42.968
<i>Would love to talk to you
before I leave tonight, bye.</i>

18:51.511 --> 18:53.775
<i>Flight attendants
prepare for landing, please.</i>

18:57.384 --> 19:01.946
Careful, watch the heads.
Okay, and we both roll...

19:02.022 --> 19:03.580
So, you have to
sit between...

19:04.524 --> 19:06.958
All right, I'm rolling on my
two cameras. All right, rolling.

19:08.728 --> 19:11.697
<i>Megan's taking requests and
she'll record a song right now.</i>

19:11.765 --> 19:12.754
<i>Wild Horses?</i>

19:14.434 --> 19:15.662
<i>Silver Stallion?</i>

19:16.803 --> 19:18.134
Any other horse songs
we can think of?

19:20.607 --> 19:21.631
<i>Tennessee Stud?</i>

19:27.781 --> 19:30.978
She's typing.
"I think I can handle that. ' '

19:39.159 --> 19:40.922
I hope she sings.

19:44.564 --> 19:45.553
That's good.

19:48.535 --> 19:49.934
That's really good.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.338
She's so hot.

20:01.414 --> 20:03.712
Can we
request some more songs?

20:03.783 --> 20:08.049
This is fun. You can just
request paintings for Abby to do

20:08.121 --> 20:10.112
and songs for
Megan to sing.

20:10.190 --> 20:11.487
That was pretty good.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.651
That was
really good.

20:13.727 --> 20:15.524
That was good.

20:17.063 --> 20:18.997
She just did that.

20:21.201 --> 20:23.533
So, on Angela's
website, on her Facebook,

20:23.603 --> 20:25.230
does she have
all her songs up?

20:25.305 --> 20:26.329
She's got
a bunch of them.

20:26.406 --> 20:28.533
Like a published artist?
Like a musician?

20:30.143 --> 20:32.839
This one's sick,
but it's the other one.

20:35.382 --> 20:39.910
Tell her how much we like the
other song, where she plays guitar.

20:49.129 --> 20:51.461
And the other one, I can't
remember what it's called.

20:55.835 --> 20:59.066
Huh.
That's not good.

21:10.650 --> 21:11.639
Search.

21:17.357 --> 21:21.418
Sort of sounds like it,
a little different though.

21:31.671 --> 21:33.263
It's really similar, though.

21:33.340 --> 21:38.243
It's not as good.
Angela's is better.

21:38.311 --> 21:39.300
Yes.

21:40.614 --> 21:42.809
All right, listen,
you can't hold it against her.

21:42.882 --> 21:44.110
She didn't say,
"Hey, I wrote this song. ' '

21:44.184 --> 21:45.674
It doesn't matter, she's
still... Yeah. Yeah.

21:45.752 --> 21:48.653
And still, her voice is 10
times better than this girl.

21:50.223 --> 21:51.952
And she's clearly
an artist because

21:52.025 --> 21:54.653
that came from deep
expression and feeling.

21:54.728 --> 21:57.219
She found a song, kind of
obscure... She covered a song.

21:57.297 --> 21:59.891
Yeah. People make careers out of that.

21:59.966 --> 22:01.831
So, you're just
playing this off Facebook?

22:01.901 --> 22:04.426
No, I'm not,
I'm playing this off... Look.

22:09.075 --> 22:10.167
Amy Kuney.

22:13.413 --> 22:14.937
This is it.

22:17.017 --> 22:18.575
I have food
in my mouth.

22:20.053 --> 22:22.988
I mean, is this not
the exact same recording?

22:23.056 --> 22:24.546
I'm not sure.

22:34.401 --> 22:36.767
Sounds
a little different.

22:38.538 --> 22:39.630
Definitely it.

22:39.939 --> 22:42.806
They posted it online.
I know.

22:42.876 --> 22:45.970
She posted
somebody else's music.

22:46.046 --> 22:47.035
Did she post it...

22:47.113 --> 22:50.640
Now, that doesn't mean she doesn't
just put up a song that she likes. Fine.

22:50.717 --> 22:53.208
But it's called... The
artists are "Mom and Megan. ' '

22:53.286 --> 22:54.651
And I complimented
her and she said,

22:54.721 --> 23:00.523
"Thanks for listening to me cough
the dust off my vocal cords. ' '

23:00.593 --> 23:06.589
She responded to a number of
compliments that I gave her

23:06.666 --> 23:09.226
about the song and
how much I liked it,

23:09.302 --> 23:13.705
and it's not even
her singing.

23:13.773 --> 23:15.832
It's just a recording
of somebody else's song.

23:15.909 --> 23:17.274
Are we sure
about that?

23:17.343 --> 23:18.674
Yes.

23:29.255 --> 23:32.713
Sounds a lot like that
other girl, doesn't it?

23:35.028 --> 23:36.052
What's her name?

23:40.900 --> 23:42.390
Yeah, come on.

23:42.469 --> 23:43.663
What, "come on"?

23:43.737 --> 23:45.204
You think that's Megan?

23:45.338 --> 23:46.828
I don't know.

23:46.906 --> 23:51.570
I don't know. I mean, I would have
never second-guessed it, but...

23:51.644 --> 23:54.807
<i>But where did she find a cover
of Tennessee Stud in half an hour?</i>

24:02.589 --> 24:05.717
Wait. Who is that?

24:07.460 --> 24:10.088
Oh, my God!
What?

24:11.397 --> 24:13.661
Is this it?
Yes!

24:13.733 --> 24:15.860
No, no, no. Play yours,
play yours. This is it!

24:15.935 --> 24:17.664
Play yours! Play yours.

24:17.737 --> 24:22.174
This is it, Rel.
I'm 100%.

24:25.678 --> 24:26.838
Let me hear yours.

24:26.913 --> 24:29.381
It's the same song, Rel.

24:34.521 --> 24:36.079
Oh, my God.

24:39.192 --> 24:41.183
Oh, my God.

24:43.863 --> 24:49.392
They are complete psychopaths.
They are complete psychopaths.

24:49.469 --> 24:51.869
I've probably been chatting
with a guy this whole time.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.569
Oh, my God!

24:56.142 --> 24:58.406
Just to ask her to
explain what's going on.

25:07.220 --> 25:08.710
Say, "Have you
listened to the two?"

25:10.623 --> 25:14.650
I mean, that is enough for me to
just never, ever talk to them again.

25:14.727 --> 25:16.752
Why should I
waste time with this?

25:16.830 --> 25:22.530
I mean, if she's going to try and tell
me that that's not the same song...

25:22.602 --> 25:24.593
All I'm saying is,

25:24.671 --> 25:27.299
if you come off too angry,
then they can pretend

25:27.373 --> 25:30.206
that they cut off the relationship
with you because you freak out.

25:31.110 --> 25:33.237
Yeah, I'm freaking out.
They've been lying to...

25:33.313 --> 25:34.905
You don't know that.

25:34.981 --> 25:37.245
Don't you want to get
to the bottom of this?

25:37.317 --> 25:40.377
It would kill me if
it was left like this.

25:40.453 --> 25:43.081
I can't now, it's too
late. It's all bullshit.

25:44.023 --> 25:45.581
I don't want to
be a part of this.

25:45.658 --> 25:47.853
We don't know
how much of it is bullshit.

25:47.927 --> 25:50.953
And they don't know how much
of it you know is bullshit.

25:51.030 --> 25:53.624
You've just found, like,
the tip of the iceberg.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.601
I mean, I talked to somebody on
the phone, two different people.

25:56.669 --> 25:58.534
You never
talked to Abby?

25:58.605 --> 26:02.905
No. Which is also weird, 'cause every
time I've called, it's been like,

26:02.976 --> 26:05.809
"She just went to sleep," or,
"Let me see if I can wake her up.

26:05.879 --> 26:06.937
"She's too tired. ' '

26:15.788 --> 26:18.848
Are there, like, newspaper
articles about Abby having a show?

26:18.925 --> 26:21.223
No. No one's ever googled Abby, still.

26:21.294 --> 26:23.057
I did. Her name's
Abigail. But she had...

26:23.129 --> 26:25.689
They claim that she has shows
and she sells her paintings.

26:25.765 --> 26:27.494
She just had her gallery...

26:27.567 --> 26:30.263
A big show tonight of all the
paintings she's done of Megan.

26:30.837 --> 26:34.034
Wouldn't this get written up
somewhere? Yeah, maybe, actually.

26:42.181 --> 26:45.116
Is this how your spell
her name, A-B-B-Y? Yeah.

26:45.184 --> 26:46.515
Michigan?
Mmm-hmm.

26:48.688 --> 26:50.918
There's nothing
on Abby, anywhere.

27:01.034 --> 27:02.296
What's Ishpeming?

27:02.435 --> 27:03.697
City of Ishpeming.

27:03.770 --> 27:06.330
Yeah,
let's start with that.

27:06.406 --> 27:08.101
Ishpeming.

27:08.675 --> 27:11.109
Do you know where Abby
was showing her paintings?

27:11.177 --> 27:13.372
At her gallery.
What is that gallery?

27:13.880 --> 27:16.542
<i>It doesn't have a name yet.
I can give you the address.</i>

27:16.616 --> 27:18.675
<i>It's a gallery that she...
She bought the building.</i>

27:18.918 --> 27:20.112
Oh.

27:21.254 --> 27:23.279
What's the address?
I could tell you.

27:23.356 --> 27:24.823
Tell me.
It's just a building.

27:24.891 --> 27:25.880
It's probably
a real address.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.756
Let's Google map it.
Check it out.

27:29.562 --> 27:31.189
I found
the building in my e-mail.

27:31.264 --> 27:33.789
I searched for
"Abby gallery building,"

27:34.434 --> 27:38.871
and I found the link she
sent me. It was $30,000.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.339
Wow. On the corner...
It's on North Main.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.379
Wait a second. "Listings
last updated August 4th. ' '

27:49.415 --> 27:51.007
It's still listed.

27:53.453 --> 27:55.944
I should probably call and
see if it's still for sale.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.148
Yes.
Yes.

27:57.724 --> 28:01.091
<i>So, I was calling
about that space you have,</i>

28:01.160 --> 28:03.958
I think it's
100 Main Street.

28:07.433 --> 28:09.196
Right, the old JCPenny.

28:09.268 --> 28:12.203
They just completely fabricated
the entire renovation.

28:12.271 --> 28:13.363
How long has it
been empty?

28:13.439 --> 28:14.997
Four years.

28:15.308 --> 28:16.297
Hello?

28:18.578 --> 28:19.567
Hey, Angela.

28:22.715 --> 28:24.842
Nothing, just with
Rel and Henry here,

28:24.917 --> 28:28.717
we're getting ready to head
over to go film some dance.

28:29.956 --> 28:30.980
<i>Okay.</i>

28:35.194 --> 28:38.254
Sounded like the gallery
opening was a success.

28:50.843 --> 28:54.506
Just a liar. How could she
just lie to me like that?

29:03.656 --> 29:05.487
I can't believe
I believed her.

29:14.667 --> 29:19.297
I can't believe I was so
gullible. I'm so embarrassed.

30:15.928 --> 30:17.862
There it is. Here it is.

30:21.033 --> 30:22.022
Hello?

30:24.637 --> 30:26.298
<i>Hi.
Hi, Nev.</i>

30:27.874 --> 30:28.863
Abby.

30:30.409 --> 30:31.501
Hey, how are you?

30:32.345 --> 30:33.334
<i>Good.</i>

30:34.981 --> 30:36.505
Happy birthday.

30:38.518 --> 30:41.351
<i>I got a Katie doll
for my birthday.</i>

30:42.755 --> 30:45.246
What? I can't
hear you so good.

30:49.462 --> 30:52.920
So what are you doing?
You having a big sleepover?

31:04.343 --> 31:05.435
What did you say?

31:06.746 --> 31:12.412
<i>She has people here, so... It's
Angela. I'm sorry, bad time to call.</i>

31:12.485 --> 31:15.420
<i>But I didn't want to have her
put you up too much longer.</i>

31:15.488 --> 31:17.251
<i>Is there a time that
we can call back later?</i>

31:20.993 --> 31:23.461
I'm just saying... Moving
forward. I'm just keeping a record.

31:23.529 --> 31:25.360
Fine. Moving forward.
It takes two seconds.

31:25.431 --> 31:28.832
I'm a little more involved with
this than I'd like to be now.

31:28.901 --> 31:32.337
And it's, like, becoming kind of a
chore, so just let me do my thing.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.835
No, it's not. Yeah,
except it's not your life.

31:38.044 --> 31:42.174
Yeah, that's why it gets a little
frustrating, when I have to go back...

31:42.248 --> 31:45.547
I'm just saying. I'm sorry, I
guess I was a little pissy, but...

31:45.618 --> 31:47.586
Try to be a little more
understanding to the fact that

31:53.859 --> 31:55.258
You can stop, Nev.

31:59.198 --> 32:02.258
So stop right now.
Just stop.

32:06.672 --> 32:09.140
Yeah, so what are you
giving me? Basic laziness?

32:15.414 --> 32:16.745
I'm directing you
in a film.

32:19.885 --> 32:22.115
All I'm saying is,
please appreciate that.

32:22.188 --> 32:24.622
You signed up for a film
that is 24 hours a day.

32:31.364 --> 32:35.425
I don't know. What's the next
move? Does anyone have any idea?

32:35.501 --> 32:37.264
Yeah.
What?

32:37.336 --> 32:41.670
I think we finish up with
Vail, then we drive to Michigan.

32:42.908 --> 32:43.897
Okay.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.446
And we just find out.
We just go to their house,

32:51.517 --> 32:56.580
and just say, "Hi. Who's
real in this situation?

32:56.656 --> 32:58.055
"I want to meet Abby. ' '

33:41.600 --> 33:44.194
I've chatted on the Internet
with a couple of people.

33:44.270 --> 33:48.104
I know my friend, she actually
just met a guy the other day

33:48.174 --> 33:50.972
off the Internet and
he was a total weirdo.

33:51.043 --> 33:53.011
They met up and, like,
he was just like...

33:53.079 --> 33:54.979
I guess the pictures
that they were sending

33:55.047 --> 33:57.572
each other were from,
like, three years ago.

33:57.650 --> 34:00.210
So he didn't
even look the same,

34:00.353 --> 34:02.913
and he was just, like,
piercings everywhere.

34:02.988 --> 34:06.446
Like, the whole nine yards.
She was like, "Oh, my gosh. ' '

34:44.063 --> 34:46.725
Yeah, we're closing in
on the state of Michigan.

35:33.245 --> 35:34.439
Bye.

35:34.513 --> 35:35.639
<i>Bye.</i>

35:40.019 --> 35:44.752
Megan is at
her house in Gladstone.

35:44.824 --> 35:48.555
Apparently one of her horses,
which I knew, is in labor.

35:48.627 --> 35:51.858
One of the horses that lives at the
farm. So, she's got to stay there.

35:51.931 --> 35:55.992
But every Sunday
is family breakfast

35:57.369 --> 35:59.837
at Angela's house.
I forgot about that.

35:59.905 --> 36:01.167
What time is
family breakfast?

36:01.240 --> 36:02.673
She said around 8:00.

36:02.975 --> 36:03.964
What?

36:04.577 --> 36:05.566
On Sunday?

36:06.111 --> 36:07.510
I know.

36:08.013 --> 36:10.072
Isn't that
the day of rest?

36:10.716 --> 36:14.083
I think we should just get up
really early, go by the farm,

36:14.153 --> 36:16.383
and, depending on
what happens,

36:16.455 --> 36:19.618
then drive up to
Ishpeming and crash

36:19.692 --> 36:25.528
family breakfast. Bring
some OJ and just show up.

36:33.372 --> 36:34.532
Wow,
we're three miles...

36:34.607 --> 36:39.510
We're three miles from a
turn that would then take us

36:39.578 --> 36:42.069
another few miles
to Megan's farm.

36:42.781 --> 36:44.408
I'd just like
to do a drive-by.

36:44.483 --> 36:46.474
Yeah, I think we should
totally cruise by.

36:47.686 --> 36:51.622
I mean, we're here. I don't want
to just get here and go to sleep.

36:51.690 --> 36:53.180
Let's kick some dust up.
Yeah.

36:57.830 --> 36:59.889
<i>2.9 miles.</i>

37:00.566 --> 37:03.000
So that's her, right?
Yeah.

37:03.068 --> 37:05.366
That means we just take a really
quick left and we're there.

37:10.242 --> 37:12.802
I feel like we're about
to get our SAT scores back.

37:14.914 --> 37:19.112
Here we are.
Megan's street.

37:19.184 --> 37:20.446
This is it, huh?

37:20.519 --> 37:21.747
You gonna
turn off the light?

37:21.820 --> 37:22.878
No,
we're not there yet.

37:22.955 --> 37:23.944
What's the name
of the street?

37:24.023 --> 37:27.151
I think it's 21st...
It's right here.

37:27.226 --> 37:28.386
I have no idea.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.688
I think it's this.

37:30.729 --> 37:32.822
There's something.

37:34.433 --> 37:36.128
This could be it.

37:36.201 --> 37:39.568
This is it. I think this is
it. This is it, this is it.

37:40.306 --> 37:41.739
What do you mean,
she said there was a light?

37:41.807 --> 37:44.742
She said that because one of
the horses was giving birth.

37:44.810 --> 37:47.005
Just pull up. I'm not afraid. What?

37:47.079 --> 37:49.343
You want to drive into
the driveway? Yeah.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.085
There's a mailbox.
Pull up to the mailbox,

37:55.187 --> 37:56.848
so I can get it
from my window.

37:57.790 --> 38:00.224
Please, please, please.

38:04.797 --> 38:10.394
Yes! Yes! The postcards
are here! Oh, my God.

38:13.939 --> 38:16.999
"Return to this address
for proper disposition. ' '

38:22.715 --> 38:28.278
Pull into the driveway.
Back up, go into the driveway.

38:29.555 --> 38:30.681
It shouldn't
give you the creeps.

38:30.756 --> 38:32.747
We're in, like, a beautiful
part of the country,

38:32.825 --> 38:36.693
a horse farm. No, no,
no. Pull in forward.

38:36.762 --> 38:38.923
What?
What, are you crazy, Henry?

38:38.998 --> 38:41.558
What do you mean?
Drive into the driveway.

38:42.768 --> 38:44.292
What do you mean? Don't
back into the driveway.

38:44.370 --> 38:45.667
Don't back into it.
Why not?

38:45.738 --> 38:48.798
Because then we can't see
what's in front of us.

38:53.512 --> 38:54.501
Okay.

38:55.414 --> 38:57.507
It's definitely
a horse farm.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.979
Okay.
Keep going. Keep going.

39:04.056 --> 39:06.024
Do we want to... You can
pull out on the other side.

39:06.091 --> 39:08.491
I'm gonna drive through. Yeah.

39:13.198 --> 39:14.825
This all looks familiar.

39:14.967 --> 39:16.594
Probably just
from the photos.

39:18.504 --> 39:20.131
Stop, stop, stop.

39:20.272 --> 39:21.933
We can't get out that way.

39:22.007 --> 39:23.474
Just turn around.
It's all right.

39:23.609 --> 39:25.076
That's an empty...

39:25.144 --> 39:27.544
Let me just go in, let me
just go look in the window

39:27.613 --> 39:30.878
and make sure there are no horses
there. Come on out. Let's go.

39:47.299 --> 39:50.325
Yeah, it's empty.
No horses.

39:52.838 --> 39:54.703
You can't see anything.

39:59.878 --> 40:06.545
Okay, so we know that
Megan doesn't live here.

40:10.189 --> 40:11.918
What surprises me the most

40:11.990 --> 40:16.086
is that to go to the trouble to
lie as elaborately as they have,

40:17.029 --> 40:21.864
for her to not just drive here and pick
up the mail seems crazy, doesn't it?

40:21.934 --> 40:25.563
Like, we just drove 400 miles
and picked up the mail.

40:26.105 --> 40:29.040
All she had to
do was drive 50.

40:29.742 --> 40:33.178
How could she be so lazy?
Didn't you...

40:33.245 --> 40:35.042
I mean,
so lazy they fooled you

40:35.114 --> 40:37.514
for eight months.
That's pretty good.

40:38.217 --> 40:39.343
They didn't fool me,

40:39.418 --> 40:43.218
they just told me things
I never cared to question.

40:43.722 --> 40:45.053
Right.
That's not fooling.

40:45.124 --> 40:48.423
That's not like...
I mean...

40:51.396 --> 40:56.129
I just can't believe I talked to
this person and told her things

40:56.201 --> 40:57.566
and had real
conversations with her

40:57.636 --> 40:59.900
about life and,
you know, feelings.

41:03.242 --> 41:05.642
There were moments where
I really felt genuine...

41:05.711 --> 41:09.203
Like I really cared
about this girl.

41:09.281 --> 41:12.648
Now I don't know
even what to feel.

41:29.034 --> 41:31.025
Should I read you
the juicy stuff

41:31.103 --> 41:33.799
from our text conversation, now
that we're about to meet her?

41:33.872 --> 41:35.032
I think it's time, right?

41:35.107 --> 41:36.199
Yeah.

41:38.410 --> 41:39.672
You got the battery for it?

41:39.812 --> 41:41.609
Absolutely.

41:42.581 --> 41:44.708
Is the light okay?
Is it a good shot?

41:44.850 --> 41:46.977
Yeah.
You're retainer is in.

41:51.623 --> 41:53.147
I gotta scroll way up.

41:54.860 --> 41:58.557
Okay. July 3rd, 4:33 p. m.

41:58.630 --> 42:00.063
Megan,

42:00.132 --> 42:04.034
"I will do that.
Abby's so excited today.

42:04.102 --> 42:06.798
"I'm at the home now,
baking pies.

42:06.872 --> 42:08.032
"They'll be over here later.

42:08.106 --> 42:11.598
"I wish you were here,
I hope your day is beautiful. ' '

42:11.677 --> 42:13.907
Me, "Save a pie for me. ' '

42:15.280 --> 42:16.645
The next day.

42:16.782 --> 42:21.879
"Hey, babe, I couldn't understand a
word you said on the VM you just left me.

42:21.954 --> 42:24.218
"I just kicked
everyone out and now

42:24.289 --> 42:26.519
"I'm in the bathtub,
thinking of you. ' '

42:28.126 --> 42:31.254
"Funny, I was thinking about
you in the shower earlier. ' '

42:32.197 --> 42:35.428
Megan, "Mmm, I'd love
to hear about that.

42:35.500 --> 42:38.298
"By the way, I will always
have a pie for you, babe. ' '

42:39.705 --> 42:45.041
Me, "Cherry?"
Space, space, space, space.

42:45.110 --> 42:48.341
"I can't believe I just wrote
that, sorry. I had to. ' '

42:48.413 --> 42:53.180
Megan, "Cherry. My body is
craving your touch tonight. ' '

42:54.119 --> 42:57.282
Me, "What exactly would
you do if you had me there?"

42:58.290 --> 43:03.284
Megan, "I'd have you in the
tub with me, between my legs.

43:03.362 --> 43:05.762
"I'd kiss you on the neck
and whisper in your ear,

43:05.831 --> 43:08.629
"begging you to
make love to me. ' '

43:09.968 --> 43:11.026
Me,

43:11.103 --> 43:13.298
"Begging isn't something
you would need to do.

43:13.372 --> 43:15.363
"In fact, I'm willing
to bet that, if anything,

43:15.440 --> 43:16.771
"you might have to
beg me to stop. ' '

43:17.676 --> 43:18.802
Megan,

43:18.877 --> 43:22.745
"I'd take you to my room and dry
you off, touching every inch of you,

43:24.950 --> 43:30.286
"kissing your long... ' ' Wait,
sorry. "Kissing you long and hard,

43:30.355 --> 43:31.947
"to take your breath away. ' '

43:33.358 --> 43:35.258
Nev.

43:36.161 --> 43:40.120
I can't believe I wrote this. "I can't
wait to fill my fingers with your hair,

43:40.198 --> 43:43.395
"and turn your back to me,
pulling you up against me,

43:43.468 --> 43:45.698
"and running my tongue
all the way up your neck,

43:45.771 --> 43:48.865
"biting your ears as I fill
my hands with your breasts. ' '

43:57.950 --> 44:00.976
That sounds like a bad
porno book, doesn't it?

44:04.489 --> 44:06.650
"But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

44:06.792 --> 44:08.953
"Taking it slow,
though difficult,

44:09.027 --> 44:12.394
"will be very important for us if
this is really going to happen. ' '

44:12.464 --> 44:14.523
Wait, is this still you? Me.

44:14.599 --> 44:18.194
Megan, "I want you so badly
my body aches for you. ' '

44:19.271 --> 44:22.172
Nev, "Fifteen days
and I'm all yours. ' '

44:22.941 --> 44:26.502
Megan, "I don't understand
the hold you have on my heart.

44:26.578 --> 44:29.103
"There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you, babe. ' '

44:29.181 --> 44:31.581
Nev, "I'm going to
hold you to that.

44:31.717 --> 44:34.151
"Get some sleep.
Big day tomorrow.

44:35.220 --> 44:37.381
"Happy Fourth. Yay freedom. ' '

44:42.761 --> 44:49.132
Megan, "Sweet dreams of me. I'll
be dreaming of you. I adore you. ' '

44:49.601 --> 44:51.626
Nev, "Good night, sugar. ' '

44:55.007 --> 44:55.996
There it is.

45:15.494 --> 45:17.257
Can't see anything, right?
No.

45:17.329 --> 45:20.594
You think you could feel it?
If they hug you?

45:20.665 --> 45:22.895
Hi! No.
Nothing, right?

45:23.068 --> 45:24.160
No.

45:24.236 --> 45:26.761
Where is it? Right in
the small of my chest.

45:26.838 --> 45:28.203
You got to hold
the mic thing in,

45:28.273 --> 45:29.604
or else you
won't hear it, Henry.

45:30.108 --> 45:31.405
You got to push
the headphones in.

45:31.476 --> 45:33.239
I can hear you!
Really?

45:33.311 --> 45:35.142
Okay. So it sounds
pretty good?

45:35.213 --> 45:37.272
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

45:37.349 --> 45:39.317
You can hear me good?
Totally clear.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.049
We are close.

45:45.490 --> 45:48.152
We are in
the town of Ishpeming,

45:48.226 --> 45:52.629
and I think it's just maybe one more
turn and then we're on Main Street.

45:53.432 --> 45:55.627
Then there it is,
the house.

45:58.437 --> 46:00.962
No one's going to notice us.
Just be cool.

46:03.508 --> 46:06.409
This looks like it's the old
JCPenny, right here. This is it.

46:06.578 --> 46:10.810
This is the old JCPenny
building. Right here.

46:12.250 --> 46:15.219
Definitely not a gallery.

46:16.855 --> 46:18.322
Nice dream, though.

46:19.157 --> 46:23.093
Keep it a little more
subtle, guys. Jesus Christ.

46:23.161 --> 46:25.026
I think this is... That
could be it, right there.

46:27.699 --> 46:29.360
North Main Street. That was
it, right there on the corner.

46:43.849 --> 46:46.818
We're in
plain sight right now.

46:50.856 --> 46:53.086
Make sure your
cell phone is on.

46:53.725 --> 46:55.352
I'm gonna leave
the car running.

46:55.427 --> 46:57.452
Yeah.
And the doors open.

46:58.463 --> 47:00.863
Let's get the seats
ready to jump into.

47:03.602 --> 47:06.230
And have the windows open,
maybe even, too.

47:06.304 --> 47:08.636
It might be
that kind of escape.

47:09.341 --> 47:12.970
Rel, you ready? Let's not
waste any time. We got to go.

47:59.124 --> 48:00.284
Hello?

48:15.006 --> 48:16.906
No. Just stay strong.

48:18.109 --> 48:19.701
Stay strong.

48:21.046 --> 48:23.207
Hello?
Hello?

48:23.782 --> 48:24.806
Hi.

48:29.087 --> 48:31.180
Hi.
Angela?

48:31.256 --> 48:32.883
Yes.
Yaniv.

48:32.958 --> 48:34.687
Hi, nice to see you.
How are you?

48:34.759 --> 48:36.056
Good to see you.
Abby's not here.

48:36.127 --> 48:37.788
We thought we'd surprise you.
We got you some flowers...

48:37.862 --> 48:40.330
Oh, my goodness.
Abby's not here.

48:40.398 --> 48:42.093
...and some presents
for...

48:42.167 --> 48:43.327
Hi, how are you?

48:43.401 --> 48:44.698
Good. How are you?

48:44.769 --> 48:46.100
I'm Ariel.

48:46.238 --> 48:47.569
What are you guys
doing up here?

48:47.639 --> 48:51.131
We were flying through Chicago and
figured, since Abby couldn't come

48:51.209 --> 48:52.506
and it was her birthday,
we would

48:52.577 --> 48:54.568
just drive on up
and surprise her.

48:54.646 --> 48:56.045
You guys are
so wonderful.

48:56.114 --> 48:57.672
Here, this is for you.
That one, right there.

48:57.749 --> 48:59.046
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

48:59.117 --> 49:00.379
Yeah.
What's your name?

49:00.452 --> 49:02.249
My name is Vince.

49:02.387 --> 49:04.218
Hey. Ariel.

49:04.289 --> 49:05.916
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

49:05.991 --> 49:07.686
How nice to see you.
Hi, nice to see you.

49:07.759 --> 49:09.522
You guys
shouldn't have come.

49:09.594 --> 49:10.959
Oh, my goodness.

49:11.096 --> 49:12.495
We were close-ish.

49:12.564 --> 49:13.861
Wow.

49:13.932 --> 49:15.297
So, this is a really
nice thing here for Abby.

49:15.367 --> 49:17.835
Get down, Spot.
Thank you.

49:18.870 --> 49:20.064
Would you like
to come in?

49:20.138 --> 49:21.298
Sure.

49:21.640 --> 49:24.507
Let me deal with this dog.
He's vicious.

49:30.915 --> 49:33.713
I can't believe you guys came.
That's so sweet.

49:35.387 --> 49:37.981
It's our pleasure. You
guys are such a nice family,

49:38.056 --> 49:41.423
we were excited to meet you
and kept missing opportunities.

49:44.529 --> 49:48.021
You guys shouldn't have come.
You guys need to be working.

49:48.533 --> 49:50.501
You know, we thought it
would be a fun road trip.

49:50.568 --> 49:51.660
This is for your dog.

49:51.736 --> 49:52.828
This is for the dog.
A little dog toy.

49:52.904 --> 49:55.168
Oh. That's so sweet.

49:56.308 --> 49:58.276
I have something
here for Megan, too.

50:01.980 --> 50:03.880
Is she in town?

50:13.191 --> 50:14.180
Come on in.
Come on in.

50:14.259 --> 50:15.692
Your house is beautiful.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.228
Thank you. And
this town is really lovely.

50:20.065 --> 50:21.760
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys.

50:24.269 --> 50:25.896
Where did
you get these?

50:26.438 --> 50:27.905
We just picked
them on the road.

50:27.972 --> 50:30.031
Howdy.
What's happening?

50:30.108 --> 50:31.803
We tried to find a flower
shop, but we couldn't.

50:31.876 --> 50:33.810
Hey, man, I'm Ariel.
Hey, guys.

50:40.518 --> 50:43.146
Okay.
So... Wow.

50:44.189 --> 50:45.986
So, where you
guys staying tonight?

50:47.492 --> 50:49.824
Actually,
we hadn't figured that out.

50:49.894 --> 50:52.158
We figured we'd find
a motel or something.

50:52.464 --> 50:53.453
Hey.

51:02.707 --> 51:03.696
Come on in.

51:07.479 --> 51:10.243
They're not... I don't
even know where to start.

51:12.083 --> 51:14.176
<i>Angela doesn't
look like Angela.</i>

51:14.719 --> 51:19.053
<i>Vince doesn't look like Vince.
And there's a painting in process.</i>

51:26.431 --> 51:27.591
Yeah.

51:31.970 --> 51:32.994
I promise.
It's like a blown-out...

51:34.406 --> 51:37.842
It's like blown-out sun. Why?
You going to cut your hair?

51:39.878 --> 51:41.345
Oh, no. When?

51:42.580 --> 51:43.945
What kind of...
You have cancer?

51:46.551 --> 51:48.849
Oh, man, that sucks.
I'm really sorry to hear it.

51:57.695 --> 51:58.889
Wait for
a little gust of wind,

51:58.963 --> 52:00.828
and we'll get
your hair in the air.

52:18.383 --> 52:19.475
Yeah, yeah.

52:37.101 --> 52:38.864
Hey! What?

53:17.442 --> 53:19.967
At first,
Abby was freaking out.

53:20.044 --> 53:23.138
And then she put her friend
Lauren on the phone...

53:23.248 --> 53:24.340
We're just going
to go meet her.

53:26.718 --> 53:28.117
Let's just keep
playing it really cool.

53:28.186 --> 53:29.551
I'm gonna
put this in here.

53:29.621 --> 53:31.350
But don't you think
it would just be better

53:31.422 --> 53:32.946
that we have our car with us? Yes.

53:33.024 --> 53:34.252
So, let's take our car.

53:34.325 --> 53:35.587
Henry,
you want to follow?

53:37.028 --> 53:38.290
I mean, you want me
to leave you in there?

53:38.363 --> 53:39.887
You need to
chill out a little bit.

53:39.964 --> 53:43.661
Yeah, I think right now, yes, things
are a definitely weird, but I'm not...

53:45.904 --> 53:46.996
Yeah.

53:47.071 --> 53:48.595
I don't feel
threatened at all.

53:48.673 --> 53:51.335
I don't think there's
any feeling of hers

53:51.409 --> 53:54.037
that's like, "Oh, my God.
We have to attack. ' '

53:54.112 --> 53:55.807
Like, she seems
she's on the defensive.

53:55.880 --> 53:57.211
No,
I don't want to attack.

53:58.249 --> 53:59.477
Just trying to stay back.

53:59.551 --> 54:02.520
Let's just roll, Rel. If we
don't get into this experience,

54:02.587 --> 54:05.613
there's no reason to be here.
Let's ride with them.

54:16.034 --> 54:18.264
US National Ski Hall of Fame? Yeah.

54:18.336 --> 54:19.564
Wow.

54:37.322 --> 54:38.755
Yeah, sure.

54:46.230 --> 54:48.698
This is Lauren's dad's house.
Beach house.

54:59.577 --> 55:00.908
Hi!

55:05.750 --> 55:07.945
Hey.
What are you guys doing?

55:08.820 --> 55:09.912
Nothing?

55:09.988 --> 55:11.250
You going to say hi?
Abby.

55:11.322 --> 55:13.847
Hi. We've never met. I'm Yaniv.

55:14.592 --> 55:19.427
Nice to meet you.
Give me a hug.

55:21.165 --> 55:23.963
What's happening? I'm Ariel. My brother.

55:24.135 --> 55:26.000
Hey, I'm Ariel.
Hi.

55:26.070 --> 55:28.903
Yaniv.
Are you nervous? No?

55:28.973 --> 55:31.305
Nev is.
He's nervous.

55:31.376 --> 55:35.005
You're like... You're like
a famous painter, you know?

55:35.079 --> 55:36.944
I'm so excited
to meet you.

55:37.815 --> 55:38.975
You guys want
to go out?

55:39.050 --> 55:40.642
Okay.
Let's go.

55:46.724 --> 55:49.693
Abby, she doesn't really
paint. Her mom paints a lot,

55:49.761 --> 55:51.228
but Abby doesn't
paint that much.

55:51.329 --> 55:53.490
Huh. What about
her sister Megan?

55:54.365 --> 55:57.391
Hey, Abby, do you see
your older sister Megan?

55:59.070 --> 56:00.162
Oh, really?

56:00.772 --> 56:01.864
Where does she live?

56:15.019 --> 56:16.418
Huh?
Huh?

56:16.621 --> 56:18.179
Huh?
Huh?

56:32.303 --> 56:34.533
Well,
there's the confession.

56:34.605 --> 56:39.838
Heard it pretty clearly
from Abby's friend.

56:40.712 --> 56:43.408
She'd never seen
Megan before,

56:43.481 --> 56:46.507
doesn't know where she lives,
doesn't get to talk to her,

56:46.584 --> 56:48.643
and doesn't really
paint that much.

57:51.916 --> 57:53.178
Well, we're going to
see you for dinner.

57:56.420 --> 57:59.116
Well, she's here now, so it wouldn't
do us any good anyway. So we'll go,

57:59.190 --> 58:00.851
we'll change, we'll shower,
then we'll meet up with you

58:00.925 --> 58:02.483
and we'll get a chance
to hang out. Okay.

58:02.560 --> 58:06.257
Okay. Maybe you guys can come
back to the house and hang out.

58:10.368 --> 58:12.359
Okay... Cool. I will speak to you soon.

58:12.436 --> 58:14.734
All right.
Thanks again.

58:16.908 --> 58:18.307
So...

58:19.310 --> 58:20.777
What do you guys think?

58:23.181 --> 58:24.648
Hold it or it will fall.

58:24.949 --> 58:26.746
Angela's in love with you.

58:26.818 --> 58:28.786
Angela is in love with me.

58:30.621 --> 58:32.248
Right.
Yeah.

58:32.323 --> 58:33.688
You can see it. Did you
see how awkward it was

58:33.758 --> 58:36.056
when I was going to leave and
she was leaning on the car?

58:36.127 --> 58:39.028
She doesn't think we're
coming back. Right.

58:39.096 --> 58:40.427
Of course she doesn't
think we're coming back.

58:40.498 --> 58:41.726
She's like, "Don't go. ' '

58:41.799 --> 58:44.927
No, no.
Most people wouldn't go back.

58:45.036 --> 58:50.975
So, I'm 90% sure right now that
Angela is the voice of Megan.

58:51.642 --> 58:52.631
Yeah.

58:52.710 --> 58:54.439
And that I've been texting
and having this weird affair

58:54.512 --> 58:56.946
with this strange
40-year-old woman.

58:59.283 --> 59:00.409
Right?

59:01.452 --> 59:04.012
Because her voice is
very similar. Mmm-hmm.

59:04.088 --> 59:05.851
It's just like
a little bit...

59:05.923 --> 59:07.049
Slow, tired.
Right.

59:07.124 --> 59:11.083
If she just slowed it down and
softened it, it'd be the same voice.

59:11.963 --> 59:13.362
And of course we can't
get her on the phone

59:13.431 --> 59:14.557
because she's
standing right...

59:14.632 --> 59:16.156
You know, it's her.
Right.

59:16.234 --> 59:18.395
But she... She'd have
to have two cell phones,

59:18.469 --> 59:20.164
which I think she does.
Megan called you,

59:20.238 --> 59:22.172
<i>right, while we
were with Angela?</i>

59:22.240 --> 59:24.140
<i>Yeah,
but no one was there.</i>

59:24.208 --> 59:25.971
<i>I think she may have
just dialed it.</i>

59:26.043 --> 59:27.738
<i>She was there on the beach,
and she may have just...</i>

59:27.812 --> 59:29.473
<i>I was kind of
looking at her.</i>

59:30.681 --> 59:32.581
I also texted her,
and then shortly

59:32.650 --> 59:34.481
thereafter Angela,
like, looked at her phone.

59:35.820 --> 59:37.310
You want to hear
my theory?

59:37.388 --> 59:41.324
<i>Megan in the pictures, Angela
doesn't know that person.</i>

59:41.993 --> 59:43.119
No, right.

59:43.194 --> 59:47.221
<i>She just somehow found a trove
of pictures of this girl...</i>

59:47.298 --> 59:48.492
Right... who's,
like, an amateur model.

59:48.566 --> 59:51.729
But she does have a 19-year-old
daughter, or an older daughter. Right?

59:51.936 --> 59:55.531
Right. And she just
found in these pictures,

59:55.606 --> 59:59.007
<i>this photo of an another woman
who kind of looks like her.</i>

59:59.076 --> 01:00:00.373
<i>Who's not even a woman,
who's just a girl.</i>

01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:01.706
<i>That woman
doesn't look like her.</i>

01:00:01.779 --> 01:00:03.872
Who's a girl,
and just labeled her.

01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:06.375
Let's just say,
I could take...

01:00:07.852 --> 01:00:10.844
You know, I could take all of your
photos, and all of your photos...

01:00:10.922 --> 01:00:13.516
<i>And download them? Download
them, and make new profiles</i>

01:00:13.591 --> 01:00:16.116
<i>with totally different names,
and never make friends</i>

01:00:16.193 --> 01:00:18.058
<i>with people who knew you.</i>

01:00:18.129 --> 01:00:20.188
<i>And just create
a network of friends</i>

01:00:20.264 --> 01:00:23.290
<i>that are actually real-life
friends, but you don't know them.</i>

01:00:24.769 --> 01:00:26.600
<i>I mean, there's a lot that...
Where do you find those?</i>

01:00:26.671 --> 01:00:29.105
...that still doesn't explain,
guys. No, it doesn't explain...

01:00:29.173 --> 01:00:31.107
I mean, also,
what I want to know is,

01:00:31.175 --> 01:00:32.540
<i>what about the rest
of these people?</i>

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.635
<i>What about
Ryan Iverson and Tim?</i>

01:00:35.413 --> 01:00:37.813
If Picture Megan
doesn't know Abby, right,

01:00:37.882 --> 01:00:39.179
and Abby
doesn't know Megan.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:40.512
Right, maybe these
other kids don't.

01:00:40.584 --> 01:00:43.747
Then, these other kids, they
talk about Abby, too, right?

01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:45.516
<i>They all talk about Abby.
Then they don't know Abby.</i>

01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:47.454
Their friend Megan doesn't
know Abby. Right. Her sister.

01:00:47.525 --> 01:00:51.723
But Alex has got to be
fake, if Megan's fake.

01:00:51.796 --> 01:00:54.264
<i>They all relate to
you through Megan.</i>

01:00:54.332 --> 01:00:56.459
<i>If there's no Megan,
then they don't relate to you.</i>

01:00:57.101 --> 01:00:58.830
<i>'Cause she's not
fooling them, too.</i>

01:00:58.903 --> 01:01:00.427
<i>I mean,
maybe she's...</i>

01:01:00.504 --> 01:01:01.664
What about all
these other people?

01:01:01.739 --> 01:01:02.831
She's all of them.

01:01:02.907 --> 01:01:04.204
She could be
all of them.

01:01:04.275 --> 01:01:05.537
Right.

01:01:05.609 --> 01:01:07.770
I'm feeling very
conscious about, like,

01:01:08.746 --> 01:01:11.271
embarrassing her, and not... Right.

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:14.841
Like, I really don't
want to hurt this family.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.809
You know?

01:01:16.887 --> 01:01:18.411
Well, she needs
a wake-up call.

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.957
I know, but I just feel
like it's just not...

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:23.289
It's not malicious.
It's just sad.

01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:24.692
Right. No, we're not
here to be...

01:01:24.762 --> 01:01:26.252
You know?

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:28.264
Listen, I think she...
We're not here to hurt her,

01:01:28.332 --> 01:01:29.424
we're here to help.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.694
We deserve to shake
the truth out of her.

01:01:30.768 --> 01:01:32.827
Right. For our sake, for Nev's sake.

01:01:32.903 --> 01:01:36.236
I think that what we
should do while we're here

01:01:36.307 --> 01:01:40.971
is Nev should gently
confront her about this.

01:01:41.045 --> 01:01:43.639
I don't think it should be,
"You effing liar!"

01:01:44.648 --> 01:01:48.049
Megan Faccio. "Are you
seriously at my mom's?

01:01:48.119 --> 01:01:50.747
"Stay there, I'm coming
home. ' ' Exclamation point.

01:01:51.689 --> 01:01:53.054
Why wouldn't she call me?

01:01:59.597 --> 01:02:01.394
No, I mean
as far as the paint.

01:02:01.732 --> 01:02:04.292
Do you like oil pastels?

01:02:11.776 --> 01:02:14.074
Bye.
Bye. Thank you, guys.

01:02:14.145 --> 01:02:16.079
All right, catch up
with you guys later.

01:02:17.415 --> 01:02:21.181
Okay, so apparently
while we slept,

01:02:21.252 --> 01:02:25.018
somebody decided that it
was time to tell the truth.

01:02:26.957 --> 01:02:29.858
Now, here's two texts that I
woke up to from Megan Faccio.

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:41.968
"By now you know
my mom is very ill.

01:02:42.373 --> 01:02:45.774
"And I can't continue to do this
to her, and neither can Alex. ' '

01:02:54.652 --> 01:02:59.089
And then, check out this message
from Ryan Iverson on Facebook.

01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:02.557
"I need to tell you that
the reason I came down here

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:06.392
"was not to bring Megan home,
as Angela requested.

01:03:06.464 --> 01:03:08.398
"I'm taking her,
Alex, and Ben to

01:03:08.466 --> 01:03:11.299
"Dawn Farms for
inpatient treatment. ' '

01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:19.037
I mean, she did it...
That's a really smart play,

01:03:20.945 --> 01:03:24.813
that Megan's an alcoholic.
Even though I knew she drank,

01:03:24.882 --> 01:03:28.648
all of a sudden
she went into rehab.

01:03:29.987 --> 01:03:32.285
Right, it's really smart.

01:03:32.356 --> 01:03:35.325
And Alex. And that's
why they went downstate.

01:03:35.392 --> 01:03:38.987
You know? And that's why Ryan
went, 'cause he went to take them.

01:03:40.498 --> 01:03:41.624
And...

01:03:46.837 --> 01:03:49.601
Yeah, well, we're going to get
her to just tell us the truth.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.519
I think that at
some point today,

01:04:08.325 --> 01:04:12.455
we should probably have,
you know, a real talk.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:17.365
Okay. You know, a good
sit-down conversation.

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:26.203
To sort of go over a couple of
things, and clear some stuff up.

01:04:26.277 --> 01:04:27.266
Okay.

01:04:30.147 --> 01:04:33.310
And I guess you understand
the necessity on our part

01:04:33.384 --> 01:04:35.784
to sort of just show up.
Yeah.

01:04:35.853 --> 01:04:40.313
Because making arrangement
obviously wasn't working out.

01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:41.858
No, it wasn't.

01:04:42.826 --> 01:04:44.521
And there didn't really
seem to be any way

01:04:44.595 --> 01:04:46.256
to get everybody
in the same place.

01:04:47.164 --> 01:04:49.496
But I would like to just,
sort of, meet Angela.

01:04:52.937 --> 01:04:53.995
See what she has to say.

01:05:02.213 --> 01:05:06.309
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:12.916
Nothing to be upset about.
You got a great imagination.

01:05:14.858 --> 01:05:16.155
You know?
Yeah.

01:05:16.227 --> 01:05:17.717
It's pretty remarkable.

01:05:18.796 --> 01:05:23.324
But you can imagine now, at this
point, we've put most of it together.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.391
Not everything,
but pretty much everything.

01:05:25.469 --> 01:05:28.199
We know there's no Tim,
we know probably

01:05:28.272 --> 01:05:30.365
there isn't any of
these people, really.

01:05:30.441 --> 01:05:32.409
My daughter.
There is Megan.

01:05:32.476 --> 01:05:33.966
There is a Megan?
There is a Megan.

01:05:34.044 --> 01:05:35.841
But she's not around.
She's not around.

01:05:35.913 --> 01:05:38.177
All right. What is she, 19? She's 19.

01:05:38.249 --> 01:05:39.273
Where does she live?

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:42.376
She lives downstate and she's
in Dawn Farms. That's true.

01:05:42.453 --> 01:05:44.011
Wow, for how long
has she been there?

01:05:44.088 --> 01:05:48.525
She's been there for about
four months now, so...

01:05:48.592 --> 01:05:50.457
But I never spoke to her.
No.

01:05:50.527 --> 01:05:52.051
Right.
No.

01:05:53.964 --> 01:05:55.022
I feel terrible.

01:05:55.099 --> 01:05:57.033
And who's the girl
in the pictures?

01:05:57.101 --> 01:05:59.262
Just...
That's a family friend.

01:05:59.336 --> 01:06:01.998
So, I feel like
I've betrayed her.

01:06:04.808 --> 01:06:07.140
We'll see you later. We'll
see you in two weeks, Abby.

01:06:08.045 --> 01:06:09.478
Where did my mom go?

01:06:10.514 --> 01:06:12.345
I think she and Nev
are out, hanging out.

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:15.249
Well, Vince is already at the
house, watching the boys for me.

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:16.843
And does Vince
know all about this?

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.308
Smile with a little teeth.

01:06:38.375 --> 01:06:42.869
Smile with a little teeth.
You have nice teeth.

01:06:42.946 --> 01:06:44.140
Beautiful teeth.

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.557
Oh, golly.

01:06:58.429 --> 01:07:01.830
Megan. Ryan.
Then Ryan had two sisters.

01:07:03.334 --> 01:07:09.068
Amy and Sara-Ann, who is
a girl here in town, also.

01:07:09.139 --> 01:07:11.733
One of Joelle's friends. That's
how I get pictures of them together.

01:07:15.312 --> 01:07:19.009
Josh is Joelle's brother, and... Right.

01:07:19.083 --> 01:07:21.017
In real life, no.
You're talking about...

01:07:21.085 --> 01:07:26.819
Yeah, in real life, also.
And Alex, and Tim,

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:30.291
and Sophia, and I
think that's it. Sophia.

01:07:30.361 --> 01:07:32.522
That's it. I think.

01:07:32.596 --> 01:07:35.565
No. Then Nick and...
Oh, yeah.

01:07:35.632 --> 01:07:37.623
Gotta have those guys.
Had to have some cousins

01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:40.602
Just to make life interesting, if
ever I was getting a little bored.

01:07:45.976 --> 01:07:48.740
How do you keep track
of what everyone was doing?

01:07:48.812 --> 01:07:50.177
Luckily,
it was on Facebook,

01:07:50.247 --> 01:07:53.148
and I could go back and
re-read who was doing what.

01:07:53.217 --> 01:07:56.914
Because I didn't hardly
ever delete anything.

01:07:56.987 --> 01:08:00.548
And I guess, in the back of my
mind, I knew that this would happen.

01:08:02.025 --> 01:08:04.926
I think when Megan
said something about it,

01:08:04.995 --> 01:08:07.987
I was like, "Okay,
just leave everything up. ' '

01:08:08.065 --> 01:08:11.523
Because at one point I was
going to start taking things off,

01:08:11.602 --> 01:08:13.035
and I was like,
"Maybe I'll just

01:08:13.103 --> 01:08:15.128
"set some things
where they're private,"

01:08:15.205 --> 01:08:17.639
but everything is still
on the Facebook accounts.

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:25.113
Kind of had a feeling that you guys
would maybe do something with this.

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:38.220
I don't think so. I'm not
really sure I want to be now,

01:08:38.295 --> 01:08:42.095
but I'm going with it because I feel
like I owe it to you. I really do.

01:08:42.166 --> 01:08:43.997
You have such
a beautiful smile.

01:08:47.304 --> 01:08:51.468
I keep changing your smile, because
you keep changing your smile.

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:54.600
But it's beautiful.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.979
Can you show me
some of your things?

01:08:59.049 --> 01:09:02.143
Well, my mom
painted that painting.

01:09:02.286 --> 01:09:05.413
That's done by my mom.
My mom did that.

01:09:07.691 --> 01:09:09.352
Do you like that painting?
Yeah.

01:09:15.566 --> 01:09:20.367
I think I can see City Hall from
right here. Let me just get on my bed.

01:09:23.907 --> 01:09:26.501
I think I stepped
on one of my bears

01:09:26.577 --> 01:09:29.136
while they were sleeping.
I knew it was you.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:36.981
I'm not a bear!
I'm a bunny.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.288
When was the last time
you cleaned your room?

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:48.020
Uh...

01:09:49.966 --> 01:09:50.991
Don't know.

01:10:00.043 --> 01:10:02.568
Hey, baby.
I know what's wrong.

01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:04.375
You want your
television back on?

01:10:10.954 --> 01:10:13.616
You not happy today?
You took your shirt off.

01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:21.191
You have to strap
this down to the floor,

01:10:21.265 --> 01:10:24.598
because he was tipping
himself over in the chair.

01:10:25.369 --> 01:10:26.859
We just got this
new wheelchair,

01:10:26.937 --> 01:10:28.734
and it has too high
of a center of gravity.

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:33.971
What?

01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:37.807
My arm doesn't
bend that way, baby.

01:10:38.949 --> 01:10:41.417
You're going to have to stay there
for a little bit longer, honey.

01:10:44.254 --> 01:10:47.553
All of his medications
also go through his G-Tube.

01:10:49.493 --> 01:10:51.961
This one's Risperdal,

01:10:52.029 --> 01:10:54.793
and this helps with
his self-abusive behavior.

01:10:54.865 --> 01:10:59.165
It helps to calm him down,
keep him from hurting himself.

01:11:02.506 --> 01:11:04.667
<i>Why do you think
that he does that?</i>

01:11:05.309 --> 01:11:08.801
<i>It's self-stimulating.
It's just really,</i>

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:12.682
really retarded. I don't
know how else to tell you.

01:11:12.749 --> 01:11:16.708
Hi, Anthony. Luckily Anthony
doesn't sneak up on you.

01:11:16.787 --> 01:11:18.584
He gives you
a little warning.

01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:21.923
So you have to shave him
and everything? Everything.

01:11:22.859 --> 01:11:27.523
They're in diapers. They're
just totally dependent.

01:11:32.836 --> 01:11:35.270
He's going to bludgeon me
to death with the pan here

01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:37.102
if I don't get up
and do something.

01:11:37.441 --> 01:11:38.430
Sauce.

01:11:45.449 --> 01:11:48.816
<i>Yeah, I mean, she's got, like,
a lot of kids running around.</i>

01:11:48.885 --> 01:11:50.512
<i>Her son was plowing.</i>

01:11:50.587 --> 01:11:53.420
He knocked over a power line
that knocked into a tree.

01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:56.459
So, they had to cut down this,
like, 150-year-old maple tree.

01:11:56.526 --> 01:11:59.620
She's, like, you know,
dealing with it.

01:11:59.696 --> 01:12:03.655
She must be awesome 'cause
her kids are pretty awesome,

01:12:05.102 --> 01:12:07.502
at least from Facebook.

01:12:10.774 --> 01:12:11.763
Hey!

01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:14.601
No fair!

01:12:18.715 --> 01:12:20.876
<i>Hey, Megan?</i>

01:12:22.219 --> 01:12:23.652
Hey, it's Nev.

01:12:24.888 --> 01:12:27.015
Your voice is not at
all what I expected.

01:12:31.528 --> 01:12:34.019
Wait, that was a bad...
Another bad joke.

01:12:35.632 --> 01:12:38.192
But you don't even
stop to tell me

01:12:38.268 --> 01:12:41.032
that it's a bad joke.
You just ignore it.

01:12:43.573 --> 01:12:45.404
She's got a really
nice voice, right?

01:12:45.475 --> 01:12:47.067
Like soft and...

01:12:51.314 --> 01:12:53.714
Mature,
very mature voice.

01:12:54.685 --> 01:12:58.212
It's hard to say anything until
we meet, and then... Whatever.

01:12:58.288 --> 01:13:04.227
I don't know. I guess I could
agree to not get involved,

01:13:04.294 --> 01:13:06.694
which is probably
what I should do.

01:13:06.763 --> 01:13:09.197
Why would Angela
want you to agree to that?

01:13:10.133 --> 01:13:13.330
Because I don't feel
like, realistically,

01:13:13.403 --> 01:13:15.530
there's any way that
Megan and I can go out,

01:13:15.605 --> 01:13:17.596
or be together,
without her getting hurt.

01:13:19.409 --> 01:13:20.933
I'm not getting hurt.

01:13:31.922 --> 01:13:37.258
This is how I typically spend
from 11:00 on, every evening,

01:13:37.327 --> 01:13:41.320
seeing who would call.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.327
So,
which one is which?

01:13:45.402 --> 01:13:49.702
This is 1211, that's the phone
number that was for Megan.

01:13:49.773 --> 01:13:53.732
And this is 0580,
and that was mine.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:55.038
Your home phone.

01:13:55.112 --> 01:13:58.411
This is...
The home phone is there.

01:13:58.482 --> 01:14:01.883
Add that, too. So, we'd
use that occasionally also.

01:14:02.252 --> 01:14:04.117
What if
Vince picked up?

01:14:05.055 --> 01:14:07.990
He never answers the phone.
I mean, hardly ever.

01:14:08.058 --> 01:14:11.118
I have to tell him
to answer the phone.

01:14:11.194 --> 01:14:15.255
So really not much of a
challenge there, with that.

01:14:15.866 --> 01:14:19.302
What did she tell you about our
relationship, with my photographs?

01:14:21.004 --> 01:14:24.201
Well, you are her
primary customer.

01:14:24.274 --> 01:14:26.742
Right.
Primary.

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:30.302
Very happy with
that relationship.

01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:36.709
In fact, in a sense,
very appreciative

01:14:36.787 --> 01:14:40.348
of what you have
done for her.

01:14:40.423 --> 01:14:43.256
Because not only is
she a good artist,

01:14:43.326 --> 01:14:48.628
but it takes somebody that
appreciates the art, you know?

01:14:48.698 --> 01:14:53.795
I can drive downtown,
downstate in Ann Arbor,

01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:59.001
and see starving artists all over with
vanloads of their velvet-painted Elvises.

01:14:59.709 --> 01:15:06.512
You know, it ain't going
nowhere. And I've told her this.

01:15:06.583 --> 01:15:09.575
"You've been given an
opportunity of a lifetime.

01:15:11.688 --> 01:15:13.485
"Not many people have this. ' '

01:15:14.724 --> 01:15:17.716
But really it's... But you told
him that I was commissioning.

01:15:17.794 --> 01:15:19.352
Yeah.
Every piece.

01:15:19.429 --> 01:15:21.488
Yeah.

01:15:21.565 --> 01:15:23.726
How much did you tell him
I was paying for them?

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.826
It just varied. Whatever
came off the top of my head.

01:15:26.903 --> 01:15:29.804
And it was part of my problem,
too, 'cause I never wrote that down.

01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:31.898
So he's like, "How much
did you charge for that?"

01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:35.342
I'll be like,
"I don't remember. ' '

01:15:35.412 --> 01:15:38.347
So, he thinks I'm just terribly
forgetful all of a sudden.

01:15:41.017 --> 01:15:43.747
<i>I mean, it was an
amazing correspondence.</i>

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.879
<i>Yeah.
You know?</i>

01:15:47.357 --> 01:15:51.225
<i>It was a real, you
know, friendship... Yeah.</i>

01:15:51.294 --> 01:15:54.195
<i>...that I was also
looking for, myself.</i>

01:15:55.265 --> 01:15:57.324
<i>And I didn't want to
lose the friendship.</i>

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.062
<i>And there was times where I felt
like I was really overstepping,</i>

01:16:00.136 --> 01:16:03.105
<i>and I'd try to pull it back
by being like,</i>

01:16:03.173 --> 01:16:04.765
<i>"I don't want to
lose the friendship. "</i>

01:16:04.841 --> 01:16:06.035
Right.

01:16:06.109 --> 01:16:09.078
No matter what. I didn't want to
lose that, but then I was like,

01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:12.546
"If I'm lying, it's not
really a friendship anyway. ' '

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:14.649
So, it just got harder.

01:16:21.024 --> 01:16:23.618
And I really thought
you'd just end up hating me.

01:16:31.902 --> 01:16:35.269
<i>You were able to show me things
that I don't have access to.</i>

01:16:35.338 --> 01:16:37.203
<i>We don't have access
to dance like that.</i>

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:40.574
<i>So, it's really been nice.</i>

01:16:41.878 --> 01:16:44.972
<i>Dancing was an important part
of my life when I was younger,</i>

01:16:45.048 --> 01:16:47.414
<i>and I always wanted to be
a professional dancer.</i>

01:16:52.522 --> 01:16:56.788
I just threw it away, really.

01:17:00.297 --> 01:17:02.595
Threw it away to
have a good time.

01:17:05.235 --> 01:17:11.196
So, a lot of the personalities that
came out were just fragments of myself.

01:17:14.511 --> 01:17:18.914
Fragments of things I used to
be. Wanted to be, never could be.

01:17:22.419 --> 01:17:25.320
That's all I ever want
to say about that.

01:17:34.497 --> 01:17:39.935
You know, when I met the boys, I knew
I was making a sacrifice with my life,

01:17:40.003 --> 01:17:43.370
but I didn't count
the cost of things

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.601
that I was going
to be giving up.

01:17:45.675 --> 01:17:48.235
I'm sort of resigning
for the rest of my life.

01:17:49.646 --> 01:17:53.013
And this year,
when I resigned my career,

01:17:57.921 --> 01:18:02.381
I don't know, it's like
I gave up a lot of myself.

01:18:04.527 --> 01:18:06.791
And I don't know
most days who I am.

01:18:08.465 --> 01:18:09.864
She did express some

01:18:12.602 --> 01:18:16.368
maybe suppressed
disappointment, in a small way,

01:18:16.439 --> 01:18:19.931
at not being able
to pursue some of the

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:22.308
dreams that she may
have had growing up.

01:18:22.379 --> 01:18:24.370
Did you ever talk
about that with her?

01:18:24.447 --> 01:18:25.778
Did she ever
express that to you?

01:18:25.849 --> 01:18:28.181
Yeah, she says
things like that to me.

01:18:28.251 --> 01:18:32.688
Yes, and then
I remind her, again,

01:18:32.756 --> 01:18:36.658
"What is it you want in life?
Because you can't have it all. ' '

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:43.056
And then she comes back, "I
want to be with this family.

01:18:43.133 --> 01:18:48.036
"I want my house, I want security,
and that's what I want. ' '

01:18:48.905 --> 01:18:51.840
Then, that's what
you shoot for.

01:18:51.908 --> 01:18:53.432
Because if there's
something else you want,

01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:55.102
then you need to
go looking for that.

01:18:58.114 --> 01:19:00.605
I mean, I wanted to
ask Angela to

01:19:00.683 --> 01:19:03.413
speak to me as Megan
for a little while.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.080
Oh, gosh. I don't know
if I can. I think you can.

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.385
Here, you can use this.

01:19:22.839 --> 01:19:23.897
That's cool.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.588
I don't know.

01:20:23.199 --> 01:20:24.291
It's been a long trip.

01:20:25.101 --> 01:20:26.125
Painful?

01:20:40.917 --> 01:20:44.045
This has been the hardest
drawing I've ever done in my life,

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.678
for so many reasons.

01:20:49.626 --> 01:20:50.957
Well, it better
be good.

01:20:51.094 --> 01:20:52.425
Better be.

01:21:00.069 --> 01:21:01.730
That's that.

01:21:32.802 --> 01:21:33.826
Start over.

01:21:36.005 --> 01:21:37.768
It's...
What do you want me...

01:21:39.142 --> 01:21:41.007
I know what's inside.
What's inside?

01:21:41.077 --> 01:21:43.511
What's inside? Why don't
we just open it and see?

01:21:55.191 --> 01:22:01.687
They used to tank cod from
Alaska all the way to China.

01:22:02.498 --> 01:22:04.523
<i>They'd keep them in vats
in the ship.</i>

01:22:06.402 --> 01:22:09.428
<i>By the time
the codfish reached China,</i>

01:22:09.505 --> 01:22:14.533
the flesh was mush
and tasteless.

01:22:15.812 --> 01:22:22.445
<i>So this guy came up with the idea that
if you put these cods in these big vats,</i>

01:22:22.518 --> 01:22:28.150
put some catfish in with them, and
the catfish will keep the cod agile.

01:22:35.798 --> 01:22:39.097
And there are those people
who are catfish in life,

01:22:39.168 --> 01:22:41.534
and they keep you
on your toes.

01:22:41.604 --> 01:22:44.971
They keep you guessing, they keep
you thinking, they keep you fresh.

01:22:50.146 --> 01:22:51.443
It's really good.

01:22:59.389 --> 01:23:04.224
And I thank God for the
catfish, because we'd be droll,

01:23:04.294 --> 01:23:07.855
boring and dull if we didn't
have somebody nipping at our fin.

01:23:31.454 --> 01:23:32.944
Don't really
feel like it.
