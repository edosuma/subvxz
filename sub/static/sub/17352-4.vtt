00:48.360 --> 00:49.679
- Brothers and sisters!

00:49.760 --> 00:53.036
- Here among us is Tonino Pettola, the Great!

01:00.480 --> 01:02.630
- The stigmata! The stigmata!

01:03.400 --> 01:04.469
You.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.555
It's you...

01:07.040 --> 01:08.314
It's really you!

01:11.080 --> 01:14.789
You all see a sheep, but it's not a sheep!

01:15.120 --> 01:16.473
This is the Madonna!

01:17.840 --> 01:19.478
| see Mary!

01:20.440 --> 01:24.274
Wicked! Sick! Sinners! Pray!

01:24.640 --> 01:26.676
Pray to the Virgin Mary!

01:27.160 --> 01:28.991
Mother, Mother!

01:29.320 --> 01:31.959
The wicked long to be freed
of their wickedness!

01:32.040 --> 01:33.632
The sick of their sickness!

01:33.720 --> 01:35.995
The sinners of their sinfulness!

01:36.080 --> 01:39.072
I'm speaking to You.
I'm speaking to You, Mother.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.710
Hear the prayers of your faithful ones
and get to work.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.478
I'm asking You...

01:46.760 --> 01:49.672
l, the Messiah!

01:50.120 --> 01:51.269
The poor Tonino!

01:52.640 --> 01:53.868
Give us strength!

01:56.320 --> 01:57.799
- Enough!

05:03.240 --> 05:06.073
- Why does sin bring more sin?

05:06.360 --> 05:12.071
When will you halt my treacherous
and vindictive hand, Lord Jesus?

05:13.240 --> 05:15.037
Or is it You...

05:15.240 --> 05:19.870
who is gently moving my hand
for the sake of the church?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.676
I beg You,

05:22.880 --> 05:26.236
don't let me
die with this anguish, Lord.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.039
- Eminence...

05:28.560 --> 05:30.152
she's here.

11:21.560 --> 11:26.111
- You're a phenomenal lip-reader, Amatucci.
Just phenomenal.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.113
- He's Lorenzo lnsigne.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.155
- lnsigne?

14:53.040 --> 14:54.553
- Hamsik, with the mohawk.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.875
Hamsik is Slovakian.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.670
_ Friends, good evening!

35:40.760 --> 35:44.036
Today we are here with a very,
very special guest.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.718
Let's start from the beginning.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.035
What's your name?

35:47.120 --> 35:48.348
- Tonino Pettola.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.479
"TONINO PETTOLA: SAINT OR FAKE?"
- Tonino, what kind of work do you do?

35:51.720 --> 35:53.392
- I'm a shepherd. I herd sheep.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.233
- So, a flock.

35:55.880 --> 35:59.350
You need to know that Tonino Pettola
has a flock of sheep,

35:59.760 --> 36:00.795
and a few years ago

36:01.120 --> 36:03.395
he started to see the Madonna.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.273
-Right, Tonino?
-Yes.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.596
- When did you have your first vision?

36:07.880 --> 36:09.916
- The day I got...

36:10.480 --> 36:11.674
the stigmata!

36:12.080 --> 36:13.069
The stigmata!

36:14.080 --> 36:17.117
Unbelievable! Tonino, show us your stigmata.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.558
Oh... Ok, ok, thanks!

36:21.880 --> 36:23.074
Ladies and gentlemen, it's incredible.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.758
This is truly amazing!

36:25.320 --> 36:27.754
I'm close to him, and
I assure you, these are

36:28.080 --> 36:30.036
genuine stigmata!

36:30.480 --> 36:32.436
Tonino, please tell us about this vision.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.958
- In the middle of my flock
a young woman appeared, full of light.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.195
Yes.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.719
It was Mary.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.395
It was the Madonna.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.469
- It was the Madonna.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.519
- And the Madonna spoke to you,
Tonino, right?

36:45.640 --> 36:46.595
Yes.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.669
What did She say?

36:47.840 --> 36:49.956
-She said: "Tonino,"
-Yes?

36:50.280 --> 36:51.872
"you are a descendant of Mine

36:52.120 --> 36:53.439
and also of Padre Pio.

36:54.720 --> 36:55.789
You have the Light.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.119
You have the power to see Me,

36:58.800 --> 37:00.438
and to heal the sick.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.748
You have..."

37:07.320 --> 37:10.118
In any case, my friends, let me say that

37:10.800 --> 37:13.109
Tonino Pettola lives here in Montecruccoli,

37:13.440 --> 37:17.069
and for the past two years,
since he began having visions,

37:17.200 --> 37:21.113
thousands of faithful have come
from all over Europe, right?

37:21.280 --> 37:24.750
Just to see him, to meet him, to touch him,

37:25.120 --> 37:27.395
to ask him for a miracle.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.153
Tonino, you've already done
some healings, right?

37:30.360 --> 37:35.070
-Yes.
-After six months the healings began.

37:35.840 --> 37:36.989
-The Madonna...
-Yes...

37:37.080 --> 37:42.074
- listens to Tonino particularly in regard
to cardiovascular diseases

37:42.760 --> 37:45.228
-and meniscus problems.
-Useful!

37:45.360 --> 37:48.830
- In fact, a lot of athletes have come here
to Montecruccoli.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.952
Pallotta, the soccer star...

37:51.200 --> 37:53.714
-Yes, we say hello to him!
-...expected to be benched for 6 months

37:53.800 --> 37:56.030
with torn ligaments, but

37:56.440 --> 37:58.908
after Tonino touched him, he recovered.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.917
The following Sunday
he was back on the field.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.319
He even scored a double.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.630
With his right foot, which is not his good one.

38:05.440 --> 38:08.750
- Incredible. This story is incredible!

38:09.320 --> 38:10.309
You should know that

38:10.400 --> 38:14.029
Tonino receives only 100 people at a time.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.149
OthenNise, he says

38:15.240 --> 38:17.913
the miracles won't happen.
Isn't that right, Tonino?

38:18.400 --> 38:19.628
- Yes, that's right.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.836
And I'd like to say
that we don't ask for money.

38:21.920 --> 38:22.909
- No, no, no...

38:23.000 --> 38:24.831
- And there's nothing illegal here.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.871
l have a gift

38:27.240 --> 38:31.836
and I want to put it to use to serve the needy.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.675
And that's really beautiful...

38:35.440 --> 38:37.271
But Tonino...

38:37.400 --> 38:40.312
we know that something is bothering you,

38:40.600 --> 38:41.589
eh?

38:42.280 --> 38:43.918
Tonino is heartbroken.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.151
Tonino is heartbroken because
unfortunately the Church

38:47.240 --> 38:50.073
refuses to recognize his abilities.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.912
And this pains you.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.229
But today

38:55.600 --> 39:00.913
we'd like to put our show at your disposal,
which - as you know - is very popular,

39:01.200 --> 39:04.636
to speak directly to the cardinals
who are listening.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.709
And why not?

39:05.800 --> 39:09.588
Maybe even to the Pope!
Because maybe the Pope is watching us too!

39:09.840 --> 39:11.831
Tonino, what do you want to say to the Pope?

39:12.560 --> 39:14.278
- There?
- Yes, there!

39:19.000 --> 39:20.433
- Holy Father,

39:21.480 --> 39:23.072
why won't you believe me?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.149
We sent you...

39:26.600 --> 39:28.272
all the documents,

39:28.840 --> 39:30.592
but you returned them unopened.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.635
I am real.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.078
I'm not lying.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.593
I am so devoted,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.479
so in love with God,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.510
that the Madonna answered my prayers.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.034
And she appeared to me.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.189
I don't want money.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.792
I just want you to say

39:51.480 --> 39:53.311
that I am one of you.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.392
I don't want to found a church of my own.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.439
But if you in Rome

40:00.880 --> 40:04.714
continue to call me a fraud,

40:06.560 --> 40:11.111
then I'll be forced to found
a church of my own.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.068
They all want it...

40:13.360 --> 40:17.956
all the faithful flocking here to see me.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.315
What should I do, Holy Father?

40:22.520 --> 40:23.919
Please tell me.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.159
Please tell me.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.759
If he perhaps wants to tell me.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.670
- "I don't want to sin anymore”...

42:14.840 --> 42:17.434
Esther said through her tears.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.873
I've heard more people say that
than anything else in my life.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.634
And they all believe what they say.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.520
She also believed what she said.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.472
Poor girl.

42:32.480 --> 42:37.838
She doesn't know that up to the very last day
that we are able to think,

42:38.680 --> 42:41.558
we are condemned to go on sinning.

42:45.280 --> 42:48.238
That's why I need you, Girolamo.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.677
You are my oasis.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.236
You are my salvation.

42:56.120 --> 43:01.672
You Girolamo,
are the only soul in the world without sin.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.036
Only you, Girolamo,

43:07.160 --> 43:10.232
can truly touch the hem of holiness.

43:12.040 --> 43:14.076
You, who do not know...

43:14.160 --> 43:19.757
and will never know what it means
to live inside a wrong life every single day.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.472
Forgive me.

43:44.440 --> 43:47.034
Forgive me if you can, Girolamo.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.753
- Good night, Don Tommaso.

50:39.160 --> 50:41.515
- Be calm, Bernardo. Be calm.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.636
The boy has become a man.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.918
But I will continue to protect the boy.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.396
Where do afternoons land?

51:26.160 --> 51:28.958
Where do May afternoons land?

51:31.160 --> 51:33.754
The boy has become a man.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.876
- l land here.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.399
- Yes.

51:49.880 --> 51:51.916
That's true.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.357
But I will continue to protect the boy.
