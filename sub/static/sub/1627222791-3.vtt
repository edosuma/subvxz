00:00.440 --> 00:04.320
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.480
His wound is not healing.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.720
What if he dies?

00:16.720 --> 00:18.800
Does the prophecy say
the chosen one catches up

00:18.840 --> 00:20.360
and cuts the Veran's throat?

00:22.080 --> 00:24.680
We have entered a new age.
An age so dark

00:24.720 --> 00:27.240
the words of the prophets
can no longer be seen.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.000
You have
gone a bit soft here.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.120
You underestimate me
at your peril.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.680
I'm Aulus fucking Plautius!
Then where is she?

00:37.320 --> 00:38.760
The girl had a sister.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.480
I want you to go and talk to her.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.720
She's dead.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.240
I'll go to the underworld.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.240
But if we are gonna work together,
there has to be some ground rules.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.320
You don't eat anyone
without my say so.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.560
Agreed.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.400
I was born sweet
and cheerful, and I changed.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.320
Your Majesty.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.800
Brace yourselves.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.960
Can you hear me, Aulus Plautius?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.160
I'm coming for you!

01:09.200 --> 01:10.520
She's on to you.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.920
He may buy all of this,
but she doesn't.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.640
My name is Lucius.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.600
I know who you are.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.960
It was you.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.080
Cait!

01:22.120 --> 01:24.960
You can't escape this!
None of us can!

01:27.000 --> 01:31.440
Whatever is unfolding,
it is not yet written.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.920
She won't desert us.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.800
How can you be sure?

01:34.840 --> 01:37.120
Because I know her.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.480
No, no, no, no, no.
It's the left one.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.320
No, Dad, it's the middle one.
Look, I know what I'm doing.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.040
It's there. I saw it.

02:19.160 --> 02:23.000
Ugh.
Dad, I told you it was the middle.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.080
It was the bloody middle!

02:26.360 --> 02:29.000
Again?

02:29.040 --> 02:31.240
You can choose two.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.400
You sure?

02:50.560 --> 02:52.560
Shame.

02:55.160 --> 02:58.720
Anyone else want to try their luck?

02:58.760 --> 03:01.000
I'll give it a go.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.160
Always like to gamble.
Mm.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.000
This one.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.520
Oh, beginner's luck.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.120
Another?
Why not?

03:31.240 --> 03:34.240
I saw you out on the road
about three days ago.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.800
Did you?
You don't remember?

03:38.120 --> 03:40.040
This one.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.680
Hmm.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.480
Another.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.120
I'm sure it was you.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.160
You stopped,
stared at me and then said,

03:51.200 --> 03:53.920
"What are you staring at?"
What were you staring at?

04:00.320 --> 04:03.480
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. You're
not very good at this, are you?

04:03.520 --> 04:06.480
Do you want to gamble or not?

04:07.600 --> 04:09.520
Can you cover this?

04:09.560 --> 04:12.560
Easily.
I don't see it.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.920
Buried. Out there.
Oh, that's smart.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.920
You win, I'll take you to it.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.840
Damn right you will.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.040
How much is that?
Shh!

04:31.920 --> 04:34.760
This is almost painful, but...

04:36.200 --> 04:37.680
Wait.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.480
Well, come on, sweet cheeks.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.320
Let's see the lady.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.840
Oh, fuck!

04:55.200 --> 04:57.240
Keep it.
Oh, go fuck yourself.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.560
Why don't you?

04:58.600 --> 05:01.480
Cos that's the way it's ever
gonna happen, you ugly old bitch.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.160
Everyone take a step back.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.680
Game's over.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.200
You gonna take that?
Cockless ponces!

05:29.280 --> 05:31.520
Ugly old bitch?
It worked, didn't it?

05:31.560 --> 05:33.920
Yeah, yeah, sweet cheeks.
Mm-hmm.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.960
Yeah! Come on!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.120

Once you get the first bit,
it all flows.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.720
Look, it's finished.
My new friend here helped me.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.880
It's good, right?

07:28.560 --> 07:29.760
Everyone's a critic.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.160
Who are you?
I'm Rain.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.120
Cool name, hmm?
Shut it, gaunt.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.320
We're the White Ravens. We were
summoned as guardians of the Veran.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.400
Veran doesn't have guardians.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.320
He hasaguardian.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.720
Or did. Now he has an arrow.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.080
Yeah, that's right.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.880
Veran's arrow.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.440
Right here.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.360
Right there is my novice.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.840
Don't, don't, don't kneel.
Just...

07:57.880 --> 08:00.200
Well, OK, it's fine.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.880
Forgive the misunderstanding,
Great Arrow.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.840
It is the new Veran I guard.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.080
The what?

08:13.840 --> 08:15.960
Poor thing.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.920
Poor, poor thing.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.160
And you, Veran?
The time has come.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.640
You have travelled
many times to the underworld.

08:32.680 --> 08:37.280
That is useful to us now.
What?

08:37.320 --> 08:41.080
Do you know how to prepare
for the deep sleep?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.520
How to prepare the Veran?

08:43.560 --> 08:46.720
"The" deep sleep.

08:52.320 --> 08:57.280
Has it come to this?
The new Veran is prepared.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.680
Can you do it?

09:10.640 --> 09:12.440
You understand your task?

09:12.480 --> 09:13.760
I do.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.320
Good.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.560
Now go.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.600
High Priestess.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.160
You summoned me.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.080
Indeed. I have devised
a list of rules.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.960
One, you and your friends
are to remain indoors

10:05.000 --> 10:06.920
after the hours of darkness.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.120
Two, under no circumstances

10:09.160 --> 10:11.240
are you to approach, speak to,

10:11.280 --> 10:14.560
or fraternise with
any of the serving men.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.160
Three, your, erm, attire.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.080
We'd appreciate it
if you adopted

10:20.120 --> 10:22.200
a more sober style of dress.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.360
Something akin to this, uh?
Help you blend it.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.160
Local customs.
Send the right message.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.520
Hey, hey.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.960
No, no, no whispering.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.840
Hey, stand over here
where I can see you.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.040
OK.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.600
Now, have I made myself clear?

10:45.640 --> 10:47.840
Can I try it on?
What?

10:47.880 --> 10:50.280
I like it.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.520
Can I try it on?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.240
Sure.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.480
General, quick word
about the new arrivals.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.600
I'm a little bit worried about the
effect they're having on the men.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.960
Oh, Widicus, Widicus, Widicus.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.720
I've tried to tell her
over and over, but does she listen?

11:09.560 --> 11:13.000
Yeah, I'm a Roman general,
I'm here to do a job.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.080
I am trying to build
a fucking empire here!

11:16.120 --> 11:18.480
Quell an insurgent populus.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.440
Not bring your fucking wife
to work day, is it?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.640
Are you married?

11:23.680 --> 11:25.800
Ay... Helen.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.160
And where is Helen?

11:27.200 --> 11:30.800
Back home with the kids.
Exactly!

11:30.840 --> 11:33.240
Hey, will you do me a favour?
Anything, General.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.000
The next time you see my wife,

11:35.040 --> 11:38.000
you tell her exactly
what you've just told me.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.560
Right.
Be firm, tell her what's what.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.440
Don't hold back,
because I've got a feeling

11:42.480 --> 11:44.320
that she will listen to you.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.800
Leave it with me.
Thanks, mate.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.880
Oh, and Widicus.
Sir?

11:49.920 --> 11:52.000
You just tell me
how that goes, will you?

11:52.040 --> 11:53.680
Mm-hmm.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.480
Oh!

12:09.440 --> 12:13.360
We were just talking about the
underworld and your return to it.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!

12:15.000 --> 12:17.360
What's wrong?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.440
Excuse us.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.520
First of all, that is my witch.
Bought and paid for.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.080
What is the reason for this...
You stay out of this.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.200
To find a sister, Islene.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.120
Get her to lean on the girl.
The Chosen One.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.480
Right. Anybody else
you want to tell?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.360
I presume she's told you
about the dangers.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.840
Oh, dear, bit trembly-wembly?
Oh, piss off.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.120
Knocking knees, scaredy sparrow.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.920
You were perfectly fine last time.

12:39.960 --> 12:44.320
You know nothing of last time.
Give me a day to prepare.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.120
Hear that? Witch says, "Yay."

12:47.160 --> 12:50.160
You're cleared for entry.
You do not enter the underworld.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.960
The underworld enters you.
Ouch!

12:52.000 --> 12:54.120
Save your breath -
I've heard it before.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.520
Veran spoke the truth.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.160
Relax, Witch. Aulus is a big boy.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.080
Then I shall prepare,
as should you.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.000
Spill it then.
Spill what?

13:12.040 --> 13:14.600
Why are you being
such a chickeny boots?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.600
What happened last time
to give you the willies?

13:22.440 --> 13:25.840
Nothing.
Exactly.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.360
Or you'd have told me.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.000
Say, for example,

13:33.040 --> 13:35.480
you started seeing things.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.480
Things from your past,
things which haunt you.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.280
You wouldn't keep something
as important as that to yourself.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.520
You simply wouldn't dare.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.400
How could I?

13:50.280 --> 13:53.280
There is nothing
I can hide from you.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.160
Splendid.

13:55.200 --> 14:00.200
Then I suggest you calm down,
man up and prepare.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.240
One for me.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.080
One, two for you.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.920
One for me and one, two for you.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.560
I don't mind down the middle.
No, no, we shook.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.840
It was your plan.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.000
You're the one
with the skills, though.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.560
But may I give you
just a little tip?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.640
The fastest way to get gold
out of a man

14:33.680 --> 14:36.680
is to make him think he's
getting one over another man.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.400
Imagine a queen has two suitors.

14:40.440 --> 14:45.520
If she goes on to A about how
much gold B is lavishing on her,

14:45.560 --> 14:48.080
it makes A jealous.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.280
Before long, they're both
lashing it around.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.280
Then you simply flay them
both alive and take the lot.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.400
I think I could learn
a lot from you.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.400
That's just basic diplomacy.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.480
But, right now, I'm on a mission.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.680
What mission?
Oldest one of all.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.080
Revenge.
On who?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.360
A man.
Well, there's a surprise.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.920
I trusted him and he betrayed me,

15:11.960 --> 15:16.040
and I lost... everything.

15:16.080 --> 15:21.080
I'm going to find him, and I'm going
to exact glorious vengeance.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.200
Big plans don't come cheap.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.800
First, I need my war chest.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.040
War chest?

15:27.080 --> 15:31.560
Yeah, like queens have when they
really want to fuck up an enemy.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.880
See, my big plans
have several different phases.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.720
Phase one, emancipation.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.360
Also known as
murder three in-bred butt-fuckers,

15:40.400 --> 15:42.360
steal their horse
and get the hell out.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.720
And this, this is phase two,

15:45.760 --> 15:48.280
Operation War Chest.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.080
So it's like a quest.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.440
Yeah, I like that. My quest.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.080
I don't like quests.
I'd rather just be.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.840
Be what?
Search me.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.920
No, no, no, search yourself,

16:01.960 --> 16:04.560
because that's
where you'll find it.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.360
Not out here, but in there.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.600
Patrol.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.680
I don't expect you to join me.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.120
Just as soon as I get
enough scratch together,

16:36.160 --> 16:38.560
then we can go our separate ways.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.600
And when I find him,

16:40.640 --> 16:42.440
and as I'm looking in his eyes

16:42.480 --> 16:45.720
as I'm about to feed him his
remaining testicle, I'll say,

16:45.760 --> 16:49.360
"This one's for Maggie,
a young girl I met on the road.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.560
She helped me do this."

16:51.600 --> 16:52.800
Thanks.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.360
What is it?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.120
The new Veran. He's very...

17:14.160 --> 17:16.120
..small.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.520
They always are.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.880
Can't believe it's over.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.360
It may be, my son.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.080
It may be.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.680
There will be other Verans.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.760
But what power will they have?

17:39.480 --> 17:42.160
When the first man
was vanquished,

17:42.200 --> 17:45.520
he fell into the Lake of Tears

17:45.560 --> 17:48.960
and the underworld was born.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.840
From this darkness sprung light.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.040
Light to light the way.

18:01.720 --> 18:05.360
Now the flame flickers.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.320
The way ahead darkens.

18:09.520 --> 18:15.000
Until the day comes when
the sun does not rise,

18:15.040 --> 18:17.800
the earth lies black,

18:17.840 --> 18:20.840
the rivers stilled,

18:20.880 --> 18:23.200
Permanence will pass,

18:23.240 --> 18:28.680
and in its place
an endless, soundless void.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.800
All our prayers, our sacrifices

18:34.840 --> 18:37.960
will be silent screams,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.640
bellows into nothing.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.000
A sea of blood
will not bring it back.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.000
We will have failed the Earth,

18:48.040 --> 18:51.000
we will have failed the sun,

18:51.040 --> 18:56.160
we will have failed the river,
the wind, the trees.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.240
We will have failed our dead.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.720
We will have failed our children.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.800
We will have failed...

19:07.840 --> 19:10.720
..what comes after.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.360
Blood.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.640
Only blood.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.040
Have you never asked yourself

19:45.080 --> 19:48.040
why I let you into the underworld?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.560
You think you understand
this game, rogue?

20:06.360 --> 20:07.920
It looks shiny.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.840
Shiny or slippery?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.960
Like a newborn baby.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.760
Our baby.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.720
Our baby.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.680
Bad luck, boys.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.920
No!

20:54.960 --> 20:57.360
We need to go.
Not yet.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.080
Over there, in the corner.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.600
Massive purse around his belt.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.560
Top quality lamp oil.

Six dozen jars - and a fair price

27:17.280 --> 27:19.520
My daughter, Ivy.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.240
Shy.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.640
Don't worry, darling.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.560
Come on, you lot.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.880
This is a bad idea.
Trust me, Maggie.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.520
Ivy.
Ivy.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.480
After this,
we'll be living like queens.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.000
What?

28:32.280 --> 28:34.120
What are you doing here?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.120
I summoned the other one.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.520
The general's wife.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.160
You summoned Hemple?

28:40.200 --> 28:42.000
What's so funny?

28:42.040 --> 28:45.080
Let's pretend
you summoned me instead.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.600
Here I am.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.560
Summoned.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.360
I'd appreciate it
if you and your friends

28:51.400 --> 28:55.720
could keep your activities
to a bare minimum,

28:55.760 --> 28:58.000
out of sight and earshot.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.120
And you are not to speak
to the men

29:01.160 --> 29:03.600
or touch any of the men.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.400
You've got nice eyes...

29:05.440 --> 29:08.080
Thank you.
..And mouth.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.320
I'm married.
We know.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.200
Helen. Back home, with the kids.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.360
How did you know about that?

29:15.400 --> 29:17.320
Is she a good mum?

29:17.360 --> 29:19.640
She's the best.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.800
Bet she is, back home,

29:21.840 --> 29:24.680
while you're here, doing your duty.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.680
Is she a good wife?

29:27.720 --> 29:29.560
She's... excellent.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.040
I can be Helen.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.440
Oh.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.960
No smoke, no stink. Top notch.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.840
Why haven't I seen you before?

29:52.880 --> 29:55.240
We're new to these parts.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.160
Just like you.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.840
Who'd you say you worked for?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.480
We didn't. We're free agents.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.520
Free agents, huh?

30:04.560 --> 30:07.840
If your Emperor can't afford
the best, don't waste our time.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.840
Come on, Ivy.
They don't want it. Let's go.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.800
Sixty pieces a jar.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.320
A hundred.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.320
Sixty-five.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.560
Dear, dear, dear, dear... 95.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.320
Our centurion's away.
He doesn't return until morning.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.680
Without his authority,
I can't go above 70.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.040
So 70's my final offer.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.600
Your centurion's away?

30:38.640 --> 30:40.640
Here's our final offer.

30:40.680 --> 30:44.280
His quarters, his food,
his wine, his bed.

30:44.320 --> 30:48.240
And, in the morning, we'll shake on
70. Take it or leave it.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.800
I can't do that.

30:50.840 --> 30:54.160
And I'll throw in an extra jar...

30:54.200 --> 30:56.400
..just for you.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.440
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh!

31:01.480 --> 31:03.000
Are you nuts?

31:03.040 --> 31:05.120
This is a Roman stockade.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.840
And this is Roman wine.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.560
We should've taken 60.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.520
And missed my first
decent bed in years? Mm.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.280
Life lessons, darling.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.240
Always add some sprinkles
to the bun.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.880
I'm not happy.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.280
You're very welcome to leave.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.720
Aah! You have to admit,

31:24.760 --> 31:26.760
it's better than
the back of a cart.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.160
First light.
Huh?

31:29.200 --> 31:31.800
We leave at first light.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.760
Deal.

31:53.280 --> 31:56.120
What did you mean last time...

31:56.160 --> 31:58.680
..when you said I was your baby?

31:58.720 --> 32:01.080
My baby.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.600
That's what you said. You and Veran.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.000
You're shaking.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.480
Just do it.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.560
Who's gonna get me another drink?

32:36.600 --> 32:38.840
Thought there were
gentlemen around here.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.120
I am a gentleman - around here.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.520
Hey, watch out.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.400
Quartermaster, come with me.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.040
Come.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.880
That's Hercules...

33:39.760 --> 33:41.800
No, it's not.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.880
It's Epona.

33:43.920 --> 33:47.480
Who's Epona when he's at home?
She.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.680
The horse goddess, and she is.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.080
She is what?
At home.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.320
Unlike me.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.520
So who's this Hercules then?

34:01.520 --> 34:05.200
Hercules...
stole the Girdle of Hippolyta.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.040
Queen of the Amazons.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.600
If you say so.

34:09.640 --> 34:11.640
What's your name?

34:11.680 --> 34:13.560
Listen, if you're looking for,
you know...

34:13.600 --> 34:15.720
I like boys.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.600
Yeah?

34:20.400 --> 34:23.520
Ivy.
Caius.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.080
Your mum's fun.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.880
She's not my mum.

34:26.920 --> 34:31.920
We met on the road.
Hmm. Is that when you became a thief?

34:33.480 --> 34:36.000
A thief, and a liar.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.680
You stole that oil cart.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.760
I was at the tavern.
Saw the whole deal.

34:42.800 --> 34:46.200
Took some real balls trying
to sell it to our Quartermaster.

34:46.240 --> 34:49.840
He'd love to know. Do you reckon?

34:49.880 --> 34:52.600
He'll have your oil
and flay you for fun.

34:52.640 --> 34:55.960
Yeah, I wouldn't...
I'm trained to kill.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.160
Lucky for you I'm rubbish at it.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.560
Plus, our Quartermaster's
a total wanker.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.840
Come on, don't be shy!

35:07.800 --> 35:09.480
Oh, go and get a drink, boys.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.720
I'll take it from here.

35:13.200 --> 35:17.120
I've got something
very special in here for you.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.800
Nice and comfy in here.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.480
Good boy.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.600
Well, are you coming in?

35:30.640 --> 35:33.560
Thank you.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.880
So you won't tell anyone?

35:34.920 --> 35:37.840
I've met real thieves.
And you are not one.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.840
So what am I?
You're a bit lost.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.280
Like me.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.160
I think you may be right.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.440
The worst part is,
I can't tell anyone.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.840
You just told me.

35:54.760 --> 35:59.040
Do you ever see things?
Things that aren't real.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.200
Like what?

36:02.200 --> 36:05.320
I don't know. Sorry.
Stupid question. Forget it.

36:05.360 --> 36:07.800
I said I was lost, not mad.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.280
Whenever I am lonely...

36:13.320 --> 36:15.600
I look up there and I pick one.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.440
I send a message home.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.720
To Mum.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.760
Let her know I'm thinking about her.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.440
And that I'm alright.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.160
And I know she hears it.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.560
She hears it.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.400
I've really gotta go.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.200
There's a northern boy
I'm trying to pull,

36:37.240 --> 36:40.400
and he is just about drunk enough.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.600
It was nice meeting you.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.600
Wish me luck.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.880
Good luck to you, too...
wherever you're going.

37:19.800 --> 37:23.240
Dad... I miss you.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.720
I miss everyone.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.800
It's been a long road,
but I've found someone.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.840
And she's taking good care of me.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.160
Oh, no.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.760
Oh, fucking hell.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.440
Aulus Plautius, I'm coming for you.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.440
So I'm your baby, am I?

41:13.120 --> 41:15.840
Wait! Islene.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.360
You have a sister
in the other world.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.160
Where is she?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.600
You wish to visit the dead,

41:38.600 --> 41:40.680
to know the way?

41:40.720 --> 41:43.800
This way, my child.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.080
This way.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.280
Our beautiful child.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.120
Hello?
