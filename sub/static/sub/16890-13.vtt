Oh, no, my phone died.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.263
Time to break out of my what?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.431
Dang it, Cyndee!

19:00.515 --> 19:01.558
Idiot.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.184
Ow!

19:03.267 --> 19:04.310
Don't drop me!

19:05.979 --> 19:08.189
Oh!
Hey there, kids!

19:08.272 --> 19:09.482
I saved a cat.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.985
Randy.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.240
So you admit it.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.617
You do like pizza.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.247
Stop!

19:24.330 --> 19:25.373
Kimmy time!

19:25.456 --> 19:27.417
I found 'em, everyone.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.836
Randy found the Mole Women.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.464
Oh, no, don't mind me.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.800
Just making a birdhouse.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.928
Please tell me you've got
something on the Reverend,

19:38.011 --> 19:39.303
because Chris and I

19:39.387 --> 19:41.014
spent last night
watching Spanish HBO

19:41.098 --> 19:42.724
to practice our Español

19:42.807 --> 19:45.810
for an upcoming trip
to Orlañdo, Florída.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.520
Nope, I've got nothing.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.646
But I'll figure something out.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.773
I have to.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.899
Well, that'd be great,

19:50.982 --> 19:52.191
because we got to start packing.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.610
This one likes
to take everything.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.903
Hey, I'm not paying
Orlando prices

19:54.986 --> 19:56.780
for female condoms.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.659
Um, hello.

20:03.787 --> 20:07.040
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

20:07.124 --> 20:09.208
This man is a liar!

20:09.292 --> 20:11.252
He never believed he was saving
us from the apocalypse,

20:11.335 --> 20:13.588
because he never believed
the apocalypse was coming.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.006
Sure I did.

20:15.090 --> 20:16.133
No, you didn't.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.425
Admit you lied.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.136
Well, then that
would be a lie.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.596
[all muttering in agreement]

20:21.679 --> 20:23.014
[Kimmy] Okay.

20:23.098 --> 20:25.600
Then why didn't you not
un-anti-believe

20:25.683 --> 20:28.019
that the apocalypse
wasn't not coming?

20:28.103 --> 20:29.562
Because I never did.

20:31.189 --> 20:34.067
Ms. Schmidt, I'm gonna need
to wrap this up.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.443
The birdhouse, I'm giving it

20:35.526 --> 20:37.154
to my granddaughter
as a birthday gift,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.114
which means I need
to go buy gift wrap

20:39.197 --> 20:40.824
before Pat's Crafts closes,

20:40.907 --> 20:42.867
which means I'm gonna need
to wrap this up.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.535
Just give me a minute.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.329
I have...

20:46.412 --> 20:48.623
new evidence.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.459
No, it's the Reverend's
sacred tape.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.503
It's okay, Sister Gretchen.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.712
It's okay.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.007
I guess God just wanted
the people

20:57.090 --> 21:00.468
to see my kick-ass Rick mix.

21:00.551 --> 21:03.304
I'd like to submit
this videotape as Exhibit B.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.223
We'll obviously have to watch
the whole thing

21:05.306 --> 21:08.267
to see why it's important,
which it is,

21:08.351 --> 21:11.062
because it's evidence, right?

21:11.146 --> 21:13.314
Oh, man, we could have been
watching movies this whole time?

21:15.192 --> 21:17.235
Karate! Karate! Karate!

21:20.238 --> 21:21.280
Na-jitsu!

21:21.364 --> 21:23.741
[applause]

21:23.825 --> 21:25.409
You better be going
somewhere with this,

21:25.493 --> 21:27.912
because all you're doing
is making him look amazing.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.123
If the guy we brought home
had looked like that,

21:30.207 --> 21:32.250
I wouldn't have had
so much trouble.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.044
There's got to be something.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.336
Come on, universe.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.546
No, that's our drawing paper.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.799
That's-- Sometimes we just draw.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.592
Hey, Mr. Trump.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.136
My name is Richard Wayne,

21:43.220 --> 21:46.472
and I want to be the next...
your apprentice.

21:46.556 --> 21:47.974
[gasps]

21:48.058 --> 21:50.143
Let's see, I started
my first company when...

21:50.227 --> 21:52.145
You son of a bitch.

21:52.229 --> 21:55.773
The bottom line is
that I'm a genius,

21:55.857 --> 21:59.819
and I'm super good at clients.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.196
What are they doing?

22:01.279 --> 22:04.074
My company name would be ISIS.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.034
Reverend, remind me.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.452
What was the date
of the apocalypse again?

22:08.536 --> 22:10.038
June 6, 2006,

22:10.121 --> 22:12.540
at 6:66 p.m.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.501
And yet you taped your
audition for The Apprentice

22:15.585 --> 22:18.588
on June 5th, 2006.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.591
[all gasping, murmuring]

22:21.674 --> 22:22.717
- Murmur.
- Murmur, murmur.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.843
Murmur.

22:23.927 --> 22:24.969
We're part of this.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.096
Murmur.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.680
If you really believed

22:27.764 --> 22:29.599
the world was going to end
the next day,

22:29.682 --> 22:31.434
then why in the ham sandwich

22:31.517 --> 22:33.686
were you trying to get
on next season's Apprentice?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.980
Because it was gonna be
an awesome season.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.357
I mean, it was the return
of Omarosa!

22:38.441 --> 22:40.068
You're not bad at math, sir.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.485
You're just bad!

22:41.569 --> 22:43.280
You never believed in anything!

22:43.362 --> 22:45.323
Shut your mouth,
Kimmy Schmidt.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.699
If God wanted women to talk,

22:46.783 --> 22:47.909
he wouldn't have
made their mouths

22:47.992 --> 22:49.077
look so much like
their privates.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.203
Guilty!

22:50.287 --> 22:52.997
[gavel pounding]

22:53.081 --> 22:54.540
You people are garbage!

22:54.624 --> 22:56.417
Garbage!

22:56.500 --> 22:59.129
Would it be possible for me
to be sent to a women's prison?

22:59.212 --> 23:01.089
[all jeering]

23:01.172 --> 23:03.925
Mm, he really had me fooled.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.051
Hey, did we just win?

23:05.135 --> 23:06.803
We sure did.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.348
What do you say we go home
and take a shower together?

23:10.431 --> 23:12.391
I snaked the drain last night.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.064
O.M. jeepers!

23:18.148 --> 23:19.316
You did it!

23:28.532 --> 23:29.575
Lillian?

23:29.659 --> 23:30.910
What happened?
What happened?

23:30.994 --> 23:32.495
Do I need to shoot anybody
for you?

23:32.578 --> 23:35.665
Hey, you found Oopsie.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.791
What are you doing here?

23:36.874 --> 23:37.917
No, Kimmy.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.336
What am I doing here?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.878
When I left New York
this morning,

23:40.962 --> 23:42.380
I was so afraid of being alone

23:42.463 --> 23:44.174
that I went on a road trip
with this woman.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.508
Lillian, by the way.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.344
Jacqueline, pleasure.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.804
But then a wolf helped me
beat up a bunch of teenagers.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.472
A wolf.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.766
In the Lakota tradition,
the wolf represents family.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.477
And I realized
that's where I have to go.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.728
Home.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.814
That's where I'll find myself.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.565
Am I gonna see you again?

24:01.649 --> 24:03.193
No, I'm gonna live
in South Dakota

24:03.276 --> 24:05.903
like a bunch of stupid
giant president heads.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.239
Of course you'll see me again.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.449
Oh, but I won't be needing
these anymore.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.540
Thank you, Kimmy Schmidt.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.629
Were these
prescription lenses maybe?

24:23.713 --> 24:25.298
Goodbye, Kimmy.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.973
[tires squealing]

24:36.851 --> 24:38.853
[phone dings]

24:38.936 --> 24:40.980
Nine missed calls?

24:48.154 --> 24:49.197
Kimmy,

24:49.280 --> 24:50.323
why didn't you
call me back?

24:50.407 --> 24:51.908
Well, it's a long story,

24:51.991 --> 24:53.743
but here goes.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.994
I was 11 pounds at birth.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.120
Rhetorical question!

24:56.204 --> 24:58.248
Immigration found me again.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.623
I had no choice.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.542
No choice?
About what?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.003
Are you back in Vietnam?

25:04.087 --> 25:07.131
Mr. Nguyen,
for the last time,

25:07.215 --> 25:09.550
I said you can now
kiss the bride.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.261
I got married, Kimmy,

25:11.344 --> 25:13.304
to Sonja from GED class.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.973
Now for the wedding night.

25:16.057 --> 25:19.102
My birds like to watch.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.647
You did it, Kimmy.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.774
We both did.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.192
This all worked out perfectly.

25:26.276 --> 25:29.653
Dong got married...
to someone else.

25:29.737 --> 25:33.074
Ronald Effing Wilkerson!

25:33.157 --> 25:36.577
I saw your little video
on the YouTube.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.496
I thought you was dead.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.915
