00:13.000 --> 00:15.208
[ominous music]

00:20.333 --> 00:22.583
[ominous music continues]

00:27.708 --> 00:29.750
[heavy breathing]

00:38.541 --> 00:40.583
[leaves rustling]

00:42.750 --> 00:45.833
[bandit leader] Not safe to walk
this road after dark, friend.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.208
Oh, you too good to talk to me?

00:50.750 --> 00:52.458
Hey, you don't look too good.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.083
Where do you think you're going?

00:56.666 --> 00:58.791
You pass through here,
you pay the tribute.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.083
I'll have that sword.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.291
Fuck off!

01:01.375 --> 01:02.958
The sword's mine.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.250
-[thwacks]
-[Davion groans]

01:56.875 --> 02:01.208
[Mirana] You will not be happy when
you awaken, Davion the Dragon Knight.

02:01.291 --> 02:02.666
But you'll live.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.625
[growling]

02:08.708 --> 02:09.791
[gasps]

02:10.291 --> 02:12.333
[Mirana] Sagan, no.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.958
Don't worry, he wasn't going to eat you.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.083
-It's the blood.
-[groans]

02:18.708 --> 02:20.250
[gasp]
My fang.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.041
I had a necklace. Where is it?

02:22.125 --> 02:24.666
My dragon fang necklace, did you see it?
[moans]

02:25.250 --> 02:27.416
You are as we found you.

02:27.916 --> 02:30.083
Now please, cover yourself.

02:30.166 --> 02:31.250
[groaning]

02:32.166 --> 02:34.583
Wait. It's you.

02:35.541 --> 02:37.291
Princess.
[whimpers]

02:37.875 --> 02:39.375
[groans, thuds]

02:40.458 --> 02:41.291
Ugh.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.041
[groaning]

02:51.125 --> 02:52.625
[Mirana] You're awake.

02:52.708 --> 02:55.125
Now that you are, I have one question.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.250
Whose blood is that?

02:57.750 --> 03:01.500
[groans]
Don't remember. I think it's mine.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.333
Maybe not all of it.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.875
Hmm. What happened to your clothes?

03:05.958 --> 03:07.583
That's two questions.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.500
-I don't see your little friend.
-Hunting.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.958
I'm sorry you lost your necklace.
Was it a gift?

03:18.041 --> 03:19.541
Not exactly.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.791
[Mirana]
What's the last thing you remember?

03:22.333 --> 03:23.416
A burrow.

03:25.625 --> 03:26.875
A cave.

03:29.625 --> 03:31.125
A dragon.

03:31.958 --> 03:34.625
[ominous music]

03:34.708 --> 03:36.791
[gasps]

03:38.125 --> 03:40.541
The elder dragon you spoke of?

03:41.708 --> 03:45.083
Eldwyrm. I remember two.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.875
It's murky. It makes no sense.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.500
Why would there be two?

03:49.583 --> 03:50.666
I think they're dead.

03:50.750 --> 03:55.125
So, you killed two of these eldwyrms.
By yourself?

03:55.208 --> 03:57.791
No. There was something else down there.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.041
I'm sure of it.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.000
[whistle in distance]

04:02.958 --> 04:03.916
[swoosh]

04:05.375 --> 04:07.583
-[Sagan mewls]
-[Davion] What was that?

04:08.083 --> 04:09.333
Dinner.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.208
[leaves rustling]

04:14.500 --> 04:15.625
[crackling]

04:16.250 --> 04:19.833
The only people I've ever seen shoot
that well have points on their ears.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.625
You know the Coriel'Tauvi?

04:22.125 --> 04:23.458
I've met a few elves.

04:23.541 --> 04:28.083
But you, your bow, the cat,
you're from the Nightsilver Woods.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.125
Not anymore.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.291
And a princess.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.541
Best you mind your own business.

04:32.625 --> 04:33.875
At least give me a name.

04:33.958 --> 04:36.083
So I can thank you for saving my life.

04:36.958 --> 04:38.666
Come on now, you know mine.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.500
And you've seen all my… secrets.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.583
Mirana.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.666
Mirana. You have my gratitude.

04:52.791 --> 04:54.791
[light music]

05:09.666 --> 05:11.666
[light music continues]

05:13.791 --> 05:15.791
There it is. Haupstadt.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.500
Sagan.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.875
[speaking Elven]
Chagu. Chagu.

05:26.958 --> 05:27.916
[mewls]

05:31.041 --> 05:32.625
[groaning]

05:32.708 --> 05:35.250
-Still feeling unwell?
-I'm fine.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.333
[chuckles]
Must be something I ate.

05:37.416 --> 05:39.416
Questioning Marci's cooking?

05:40.416 --> 05:41.750
Wouldn't dream of it.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.083
[Davion] I know a tavern
off the market square.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.041
Innkeeper owes me a favor.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.541
Don't think he serves
any "Icewrack whites,"

05:50.625 --> 05:52.208
but I can get us lodging.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.875
-That's quite all right.
-It's the least I can do.

05:54.958 --> 05:59.083
Besides, as I recall "free"
is about all you can afford.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.416
Fine.

06:01.291 --> 06:02.375
[sighs]

06:02.875 --> 06:06.166
It will be nice to sleep
in a real bed for a change.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.208
[vomiting]

06:11.291 --> 06:12.958
It's gone downhill a bit.

06:15.791 --> 06:18.666
[indistinct chatter]

06:20.291 --> 06:21.375
[mouse squeaking]

06:22.416 --> 06:23.791
[woman 1] Davion.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.083
Is that you?

06:25.750 --> 06:28.583
A bit more clothing
than the last time I saw you.

06:28.666 --> 06:31.958
-Hello, beautiful.
-[woman 1] Buy me a drink, lover?

06:32.041 --> 06:34.666
The road was long,
and I need to get my friends settled.

06:34.750 --> 06:35.625
Another night.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.000
A night you'll never forget.

06:39.958 --> 06:43.083
-And who was that charming woman?
-No idea.

06:43.166 --> 06:46.500
Nyctasha's knickers, it is you!

06:46.583 --> 06:49.250
Raise your cups, you sorry bastards.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.708
This is Davion the Dragon Knight,
in the flesh.

06:52.791 --> 06:54.541
-[mellow cheers]
-[woman 2] Hear, hear!

06:54.625 --> 06:57.000
-We need a room.
-Two rooms.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.416
And some clothes.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.125
[chuckles]
I seem to have misplaced mine.

07:01.208 --> 07:05.041
Anything for you. Right this way.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.041
[suspenseful music]

07:14.125 --> 07:15.208
[Davion] Kaden.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.666
One of the greatest
Dragon Knights of all time.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.916
I met him once
when I was a squire at Dragon Hold.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.375
Filled his cup.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.208
Thought I showed "great promise."

07:24.291 --> 07:25.791
How thrilling for you.

07:25.875 --> 07:29.625
He's the only knight who's ever killed
one of each of the eight types of dragons.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.000
He's a legend.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.958
[Mirana] How many types have you slain?

07:33.041 --> 07:34.291
Five.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.250
[Mirana] Well, you'll get there
eventually.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.666
My finest suite.
Make yourselves comfortable.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.625
We're not staying here.

07:45.708 --> 07:48.000
Only cheaper one is out back.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.833
But I suppose this will do.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.500
[gulping]

07:55.083 --> 07:57.125
[Mirana] Are you sure
you should be drinking?

07:57.708 --> 08:00.541
-You don't look well.
-Hence the drinking.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.500
Uh, get you ladies something?
It's on the house.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.750
Just directions.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.416
We're looking for the Black Market.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.833
What business do respectable ladies
have in a place like that?

08:11.916 --> 08:13.375
Private business.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.875
I meant no offense.

08:14.958 --> 08:18.916
It's on King's Way, uptown,
right off the main square.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.333
You can't miss it.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.125
Allow me to escort you.

08:22.208 --> 08:25.583
It's not safe in the city after dark.
[vomits]

08:25.666 --> 08:27.250
-Ugh!
-[retches]

08:27.333 --> 08:29.625
You know how to impress a lady.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.291
[Davion heaving]

08:31.375 --> 08:32.291
[vomits]

08:32.375 --> 08:33.625
[clanking]

08:34.208 --> 08:37.416
Was that in your stomach? How?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.375
[whimpers]
I don't know.

08:40.083 --> 08:44.041
The fuck! Did you just heave up this ring?

08:44.625 --> 08:48.333
This belonged to a friend of mine.
A brother.

08:48.416 --> 08:53.833
He was found on the road, torn to pieces,
with five more of my brothers.

08:53.916 --> 08:56.708
-You did this!
-No.

08:56.791 --> 08:59.791
They found dragon armor around the bodies.

08:59.875 --> 09:03.208
-"Davion the Dragon Knight."
-It's not possible!

09:03.708 --> 09:05.083
-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

09:05.583 --> 09:08.333
Savage! Fucking cannibal!

09:08.416 --> 09:11.041
[grunts]

09:17.333 --> 09:18.666
-[slams]
-[groans]

09:24.500 --> 09:25.916
[whimpers]

09:26.958 --> 09:29.166
Tomorrow. Midday.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.958
My brothers and me, we're coming for you.

09:32.041 --> 09:35.000
You're a dead man.
You hear me? A dead man!

09:37.583 --> 09:40.541
-[Davion groaning]
-[thuds]

09:42.416 --> 09:47.041
[Terrorblade] I smell your fear.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.125
All you have to do is…

09:51.208 --> 09:55.416
let me in.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.083
[gasps]

09:58.875 --> 10:00.375
-[door opens]
-[innkeeper] You're awake.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.041
How do you feel?

10:02.125 --> 10:05.750
Like I went the wrong way
through a dragon's asshole.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.166
There's a right way?

10:07.250 --> 10:08.750
[retches]

10:09.708 --> 10:12.333
Old family remedy. Drink it all.

10:13.916 --> 10:16.083
[innkeeper] Your lady friends
went to the Black Market.

10:16.666 --> 10:19.916
I told them to wait for you,
but they were quite insistent.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.791
I get the sense
they can take care of themselves.

10:24.416 --> 10:28.208
Um, I… I must ask you to leave.

10:28.291 --> 10:31.958
Over a little blood and purge?
This place has seen a lot worse.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.541
It's just Deeb and his friends,

10:33.625 --> 10:36.916
if they find you here,
they'll burn the place down and kill me.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
And besides that, they're good customers.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.583
Say no more.

10:44.625 --> 10:48.208
Listen, do you have a sword
or something I can borrow?

10:48.291 --> 10:50.458
You're not really gonna fight them.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.833
Bare-handed, if I have to.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.416
Not my preference.

10:54.916 --> 10:57.125
You're a crazy bastard.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.083
My name means something.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.708
I don't run from beast or man.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.541
Even if they are your customers.

11:04.625 --> 11:05.458
[innkeeper laughs]

11:05.541 --> 11:06.875
Gods' luck, then.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.708
You survive,
I'll hang your portrait on the wall.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.458
Not what I was expecting.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.291
May I help you, madams?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.458
[Mirana] Nikdo.

11:20.958 --> 11:23.708
I was told to ask for him.

11:23.791 --> 11:28.000
I see. I'm afraid weapons
are not allowed inside.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.125
If you'll follow me.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.500
[women moaning]

11:43.583 --> 11:45.416
[moaning continues]

11:47.125 --> 11:49.083
[people panting]

11:49.166 --> 11:51.291
[moaning]

11:53.500 --> 11:56.791
Master Nikdo will be with you presently.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.625
[suspenseful music]

12:06.208 --> 12:08.250
I am Nikdo.

12:08.833 --> 12:10.041
And you are?

12:10.541 --> 12:12.166
Here for information.

12:12.250 --> 12:16.875
I was told you might know
the whereabouts of certain rare artifacts.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.750
I know many things.

12:19.666 --> 12:23.416
But such information comes at a price.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.083
I am the most-favored of Selemene.

12:26.166 --> 12:29.208
She will reward you handsomely
if you help me.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.250
I know that above all.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.083
[Mirana] You?

12:34.166 --> 12:37.750
We have a better offer
than a few trinkets and empty promises.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.958
May I introduce Mirana,
once Princess of the Moon,

12:42.041 --> 12:44.416
once Princess of the Sun, and now…

12:44.500 --> 12:46.541
princess of nothing at all.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.708
I locate precious things
for wealthy people.

12:51.791 --> 12:55.875
One of my clients happens to be
from the Helio Imperium.

12:56.541 --> 13:02.041
Your uncle.
And he wants you so very badly.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.541
I should have let
those villagers kill you.

13:07.041 --> 13:08.250
Probably.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.125
The mute is yours.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.083
Take them downstairs.

13:13.208 --> 13:15.208
[ominous music]

13:15.708 --> 13:18.375
[metal clanking]

13:22.375 --> 13:24.375
Got in a bit of trouble, I hear.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.000
Nothing a good length
of sharp steel can't solve.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.875
[Davion] What can I get for this?

13:29.458 --> 13:32.208
You crazy? I'm not touching that.

13:32.291 --> 13:35.458
Just melt it down.
The gold's worth a hundred crowns, easy.

13:35.541 --> 13:37.208
It's not worth me life.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.000
Put it away and fuck off.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.916
Look, I'm in a bit of a bind here.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.208
Can you help me out?

13:42.291 --> 13:44.416
You know who I am.
You know I'm good for it.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.833
I know who you are and who wants you dead,

13:46.916 --> 13:49.458
and I don't like me odds
on collecting that debt.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.583
Sorry, Davion. Coin or nothing.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.666
I have no way of getting any coin.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.708
[blacksmith] There's always the Narrows

13:56.791 --> 13:58.750
if you got something to wager.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.750
[clanking]

14:02.833 --> 14:04.500
[man 1] Fresh meat, eh?

14:04.583 --> 14:05.750
Not bad.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.333
This one's not for sale.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.333
You can have the little one for 50 crowns.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.500
Do what you like with her.

14:11.583 --> 14:12.958
I'll give you 40.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.833
This skinny bitch
won't last a week upstairs.

14:15.916 --> 14:17.083
Forty-five.

14:17.666 --> 14:20.166
She's remarkably soft for a servant girl.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.833
Uh… Deal.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.250
Say goodbye to your servant, Princess.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.291
Although I daresay your fate
won't be any more pleasant.

14:28.791 --> 14:31.041
Worry more about your own welfare.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.291
Your men forgot to disarm me.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.375
-[cracks]
-[grunts]

14:37.500 --> 14:38.541
-[thwacks]
-[groans]

14:43.250 --> 14:45.250
-[slams]
-[grunts]

14:54.583 --> 14:56.500
I'll break you in half.

15:01.583 --> 15:02.791
-[bottle shatters]
-[grunts]

15:04.291 --> 15:07.791
I came here for information
about my lotuses.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.791
Tell me where to find them.

15:10.291 --> 15:11.375
-[slams]
-[groans]

15:11.458 --> 15:13.375
[Mirana] Or explain it to her.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.083
The Shopkeeper. Talk to the Shopkeeper.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.083
-Where?
-The Magpie's Roost.

15:18.166 --> 15:21.958
If any such merchandise
moves through Candoness, he knows.

15:22.041 --> 15:23.291
He knows.

15:27.375 --> 15:30.166
And he'll know you, Princess of Nothing.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.041
Outcast! Usurper's whore.

15:33.625 --> 15:36.791
Finder of lost, precious things.

15:39.208 --> 15:42.833
See if you can find your teeth. Let's go.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.291
[pit boss] Place your bets!
Throw the bones!

15:46.375 --> 15:48.500
-[player 1] Five on the pig!
-Twenty on the boar.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.625
-You're never gonna win, boy!
-Five against.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.250
-Five on the stand!
-Ten against!

15:52.333 --> 15:54.125
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Roll it our way.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.583
-Yes!
-Dog!

16:00.666 --> 16:01.916
You lose!

16:02.000 --> 16:05.625
-Shit.
-Make room for players with coin.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.208
-Dead man.
-[player 2] I'm buying drinks tonight.

16:23.375 --> 16:28.000
I was told you might be able to locate
certain artifacts of unique interest.

16:28.583 --> 16:32.125
This depends on the artifact
and the interest.

16:32.708 --> 16:35.333
Lotuses from the Temple of Mene.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.208
I do not deal in stolen goods,

16:38.291 --> 16:41.541
nor should a princess
of the Nightsilver Woods,

16:42.125 --> 16:43.500
exiled or not.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.958
The lotuses were stolen.
I intend to get them back.

16:47.541 --> 16:48.625
[Mirana] Can you help me?

16:48.708 --> 16:52.041
I cannot refuse an emissary of Selemene.

16:52.125 --> 16:56.666
However, I'm afraid no one
has offered them for sale.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.625
But, perhaps a man I know can help you.

17:00.708 --> 17:01.541
Who?

17:02.125 --> 17:03.166
A sage.

17:03.250 --> 17:08.666
He keeps to himself in his tower,
in a valley south of the Broken Peaks.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.375
You'll need this to see him.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.166
[Mirana] Please.

17:14.750 --> 17:19.833
I'd rather my favor be returned
in kind someday, Princess,

17:19.916 --> 17:22.333
who may be more than a princess.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.291
[Shopkeeper] Do we have a bargain?

17:34.125 --> 17:35.500
[Mirana] Dragon Knight.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.333
Princess. Find what you came for?

17:38.416 --> 17:40.500
-I will.
-I don't doubt it.

17:41.416 --> 17:42.875
You look terrible.

17:42.958 --> 17:43.958
I feel terrible.

17:44.041 --> 17:46.083
You should rest, recover.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.541
-Can't, I'm meeting some friends.
-Those bandits.

17:50.125 --> 17:51.666
In your condition, they'll kill you.

17:51.750 --> 17:54.000
That is a distinct possibility.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.875
You have no weapon. No allies.

17:56.958 --> 18:00.291
There's no shame in walking away
from a pointless fight.

18:01.833 --> 18:05.500
We're going to the Broken Peaks.
You should too.

18:05.583 --> 18:06.625
Come with us.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.583
[Davion] I won't run from a fight.
Even this one.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.833
My name means something to me,
to my brothers in Dragon Hold.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.833
-Dishonoring myself dishonors them.
-[Mirana] Stupid.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.166
Brave but stupid.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.416
Best of luck to you, Dragon Knight.

18:43.708 --> 18:44.583
[whistles]

18:44.666 --> 18:45.708
Sagan!

18:46.291 --> 18:47.208
[speaking Elven]
Komi!

18:47.291 --> 18:49.000
-[leaves rustling]
-[growls]

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
[rumbling]

18:57.041 --> 18:58.750
Don't look at me that way.

18:59.666 --> 19:01.125
What would you have me do?

19:01.625 --> 19:03.916
I'm not what I once was.

19:06.041 --> 19:07.250
Didn't you hear?

19:07.750 --> 19:09.666
I'm the "Princess of Nothing."

19:12.625 --> 19:15.125
[laughter]

19:15.208 --> 19:17.958
[bandits grunt]

19:21.458 --> 19:23.375
That's the son of a bitch.

19:23.458 --> 19:24.666
Is that right?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.500
Are you the son of a bitch?

19:28.541 --> 19:30.208
This doesn't have to get ugly.

19:30.291 --> 19:33.125
Just apologize and we can go
our separate ways in peace.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.041
[bandits laugh]

19:35.083 --> 19:39.083
Only thing I'm sorry for
is I can't kill you more than once.

19:39.750 --> 19:43.333
-You have something of mine.
-I'll have your head too.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.208
-[thwacks]
-[grunts]

19:52.291 --> 19:54.000
[gasps]

19:58.083 --> 19:59.083
Ah!
[grunts]

20:04.916 --> 20:06.458
-[grunts]
-[groans]

20:09.916 --> 20:11.583
[gags]

20:15.416 --> 20:16.875
[laughter]

20:16.958 --> 20:20.833
Not so fast, boys! Make it last!
[chuckles]

20:22.833 --> 20:24.916
[all laughing]

20:25.000 --> 20:26.250
Save me the ring…

20:28.875 --> 20:30.041
[whistling]

20:32.000 --> 20:33.500
[whistles]

20:40.250 --> 20:42.000
-[horse whines]
-Oh!

20:44.750 --> 20:46.750
[epic music]

20:52.875 --> 20:55.250
[growling]

21:00.666 --> 21:01.666
[roars]

21:02.166 --> 21:03.458
[shrieking]

21:06.833 --> 21:07.958
[all gasp]

21:08.041 --> 21:11.000
Come. Meet your death.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.083
[grunts]

21:15.125 --> 21:16.666
-[growls]
-[grunts]

21:23.000 --> 21:24.166
[bandit screams]

21:26.208 --> 21:27.333
Marci?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.791
[Mirana] Moon's sweet light.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.083
[growls]

-[screams]
-[snarls]

21:55.666 --> 21:56.666
[gasps]

21:57.208 --> 21:58.708
[whimpers]
Mercy!

21:58.791 --> 22:02.125
[Deeb] Don't kill me! Please! I beg you!

22:02.208 --> 22:03.541
I beg you!

22:06.041 --> 22:08.125
[pants]

22:15.166 --> 22:19.583
I slay monsters!

22:20.791 --> 22:24.333
Not people! I'm not this!

22:24.416 --> 22:28.083
I'm not this! I can't be this!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.125
Davion.

22:39.208 --> 22:40.833
What have I done?

22:42.166 --> 22:44.125
What am I?

22:46.958 --> 22:47.958
[gates open]

22:51.875 --> 22:53.333
You're coming with us.

22:53.416 --> 22:55.583
Or take your chances with them.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.916
[clanking]

23:01.500 --> 23:02.791
[Sagan growls]

23:11.375 --> 23:13.375
[Davion] You're headed
for the Broken Peaks.

23:13.958 --> 23:17.500
Yes. To see a sage who lives there.

23:17.583 --> 23:20.541
That's on the way to Dragon Hold.
We can travel together.

23:22.291 --> 23:24.625
I'd understand if you said no.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.000
I'm from the Nightsilver Woods.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.166
Finding broken people,

23:31.750 --> 23:33.458
putting them back together…

23:34.416 --> 23:35.416
It's what we do.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.500
We can travel together.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.625
This sage of yours…

23:40.625 --> 23:43.833
do you think he knows
anything about dragons?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.875
[birds chirping]

23:57.125 --> 23:58.166
Fymryn.

24:01.375 --> 24:02.500
You're hurt.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.250
It's nothing.

24:05.375 --> 24:08.125
I don't return empty-handed. See?

24:11.458 --> 24:13.708
[Dyfed] The Lotuses of Mene!

24:16.333 --> 24:18.333
[closing theme music]
