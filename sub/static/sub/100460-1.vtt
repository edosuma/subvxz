02:45.848 --> 02:48.684
How does the Fitbit
know you're walking?

02:49.751 --> 02:51.920
Because your arms
are moving.

02:52.653 --> 02:54.086
Say they weren't.

02:54.088 --> 02:56.722
It's on your arm.
Who walks without moving their arm?

02:56.724 --> 02:59.493
Well, duh.
Someone who's had a stroke.

02:59.495 --> 03:02.262
And I know what you're gonna
say, so both arms.

03:02.264 --> 03:04.834
- A stroke? Both arms?
- Yes.

03:06.534 --> 03:07.967
Put it
on your ankle.

03:07.969 --> 03:11.706
You'd think that, but it's not
in the instructions, is it?

03:13.140 --> 03:15.108
When are you gonna
take the decorations down?

03:15.110 --> 03:17.276
- When are you gonna take 'em down?
- It's your job.

03:17.278 --> 03:18.811
I put them up,
you take them down.

03:18.813 --> 03:20.547
You put them up,
I take them down.

03:20.549 --> 03:23.083
Just add "baby" to that,
and it could be the title of a song.

03:23.085 --> 03:23.951
Hmm.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.286
You put them up,
I take them down, baby.

03:27.855 --> 03:30.025
- You should write it.
- I will.

03:32.260 --> 03:35.294
- Are you gonna get in the shower first?
- No.

03:35.296 --> 03:36.863
Gonna have a beer.

03:36.865 --> 03:39.065
Well, that defeats the
whole purpose of walking.

03:39.067 --> 03:41.101
- No, it doesn't.
- How does it not?

03:41.103 --> 03:44.004
You're out walking to get a bit
fitter, lose a bit of weight.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.672
How does the beer
add to that?

03:45.674 --> 03:48.274
The walking allows me
to have the beer.

03:48.276 --> 03:49.709
Oh, right.

03:49.711 --> 03:52.012
Plus, more to the point,
I'm a grown man.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.147
If I want to sit in my
own house and have a beer

03:54.149 --> 03:58.018
after putting a lot of effort
into a good strenuous walk,

03:58.020 --> 04:00.156
that is what
I shall do.

04:33.956 --> 04:37.890
...after a thrillin 3-2 victory
for United the last time they played...

04:37.892 --> 04:40.061
Tom,
can you come up here?

04:41.129 --> 04:44.634
- Yes, sweetness?
- Feel my left breast.

04:45.233 --> 04:47.968
Just the one?
This is a new approach.

04:47.970 --> 04:50.202
- Just feel it.
- What, here?

04:50.204 --> 04:52.007
Yeah.

04:52.908 --> 04:54.341
Can you feel anything?

04:54.343 --> 04:55.608
A lump?

04:55.610 --> 04:57.676
I feel something.

04:57.678 --> 04:59.178
A lump?

04:59.180 --> 05:00.815
Lump-ish.

05:01.249 --> 05:02.716
It's a lump.

05:02.718 --> 05:04.084
Could be anything.

05:04.086 --> 05:07.086
It can't be anything. It can
only be one of a few things.

05:07.088 --> 05:09.091
- This could be nothing.
- Well...

05:10.158 --> 05:13.192
- Go to the doctor's in the morning.
- Yeah.

05:13.194 --> 05:14.694
It will be fine.

05:14.696 --> 05:17.998
Lumps, bumps,
pains, aches.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.099
You're of an age,
kid.

05:20.101 --> 05:22.668
I can go now?
I've done enough groping?

05:22.670 --> 05:25.307
Unless, of course...

05:26.307 --> 05:27.406
You've done enough.

05:27.408 --> 05:28.843
Magic touch.

06:56.298 --> 06:59.332
What I'm feeling,
the shape of it is quite distinct.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.468
That would suggest to me
that it's a cyst.

07:01.470 --> 07:03.870
You had a mammogram a while
ago, didn't you?

07:03.872 --> 07:06.072
Yes, about
eight months ago.

07:06.074 --> 07:09.942
To be on the safe side, we'll arrange
an appointment for you at the hospital.

07:09.944 --> 07:12.010
- Okay.
- This is just precautionary.

07:12.012 --> 07:14.382
- I think it's a cyst.
- All right.

07:15.416 --> 07:17.050
How's Tom?

07:17.052 --> 07:19.519
Oh, the same.

07:19.521 --> 07:21.323
He's Tom all the time.

07:28.362 --> 07:31.897
Do you notice anything
different about the soup?

07:31.899 --> 07:35.969
- There is. What is it?
- You tell me.

07:35.971 --> 07:39.505
Is this a quiz? If I get it right,
do I get another bowl of soup?

07:39.507 --> 07:41.774
For once in your life,
can you be bloody normal?

07:41.776 --> 07:45.512
I am normal. Very normal.
Let's see if I get this.

07:45.514 --> 07:48.380
I want you to get it right.
That means what I did worked.

07:48.382 --> 07:52.387
- I'm gonna get it wrong on purpose now.
- Just say it, idiot.

07:58.927 --> 08:00.993
- Worcestershire sauce.
- Correct.

08:00.995 --> 08:03.495
- I'm good, baby.
- I'm good.

08:04.865 --> 08:06.298
Your man is getting
later and later.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.233
What would happen if you
were waiting on something?

08:08.235 --> 08:10.937
I was waiting on
something.

08:10.939 --> 08:12.274
Oh, right.

08:25.887 --> 08:27.456
Hospital appointment.

08:28.389 --> 08:29.425
When?

08:30.559 --> 08:32.260
Um...

08:34.296 --> 08:35.331
Next week.

08:36.865 --> 08:38.299
Great.
The sooner the better.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.169
Yeah. No, no, I know.
It's good.

09:24.078 --> 09:26.112
I don't know what the
situation is here.

09:26.114 --> 09:30.116
Do I go in with you?
Do I wait? What?

09:30.118 --> 09:32.285
- It's a mammogram.
- I know.

09:32.287 --> 09:35.088
Well, they won't
allow you into that.

09:35.090 --> 09:38.023
I know, but after?

09:38.025 --> 09:42.163
Oh, I don't know. If you have to
wait, you can have a cup of tea.

09:42.998 --> 09:44.664
I'm going off tea.

09:44.666 --> 09:46.969
You know
what I mean.

09:48.937 --> 09:50.536
It will be all right.

09:50.538 --> 09:52.041
I know.

09:54.241 --> 09:55.642
They charge you
for parking.

09:55.644 --> 09:58.478
Even if you're
a patient?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.515
I think so.

10:01.249 --> 10:02.985
Everything's money.

10:03.618 --> 10:04.987
I know.

12:33.268 --> 12:35.834
And this is the
little biopsy, okay?

12:35.836 --> 12:38.070
And we're going in now.

12:38.072 --> 12:39.741
One, two, three.

12:41.576 --> 12:45.247
Hold on. We're in the area now.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.247
And that...
It's coming.

12:48.249 --> 12:49.748
One, two, three.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.117
Ow!

12:51.119 --> 12:52.620
Super. Well done.

12:58.692 --> 13:01.259
I thought you said you
were going off tea.

13:01.261 --> 13:04.363
Yeah.
Just thinking about it.

13:04.365 --> 13:07.403
No definite decision
has been taken as yet.

13:10.105 --> 13:12.307
Maybe we should
both stop.

13:13.374 --> 13:15.411
- Cut out caffeine altogether.
- Why?

13:16.477 --> 13:17.512
Why you?

13:18.580 --> 13:21.682
Taste of it.
Sometimes it makes me feel a bit sick.

13:22.417 --> 13:23.782
I was thinking
healthier.

13:23.784 --> 13:26.319
No, that would be just
one more thing for you...

13:26.321 --> 13:28.588
For me to what?

13:28.590 --> 13:31.192
For you to hit me
with a stick about.

13:31.893 --> 13:34.359
Very good.

13:34.361 --> 13:36.230
I should hit you
with something.

13:44.471 --> 13:47.643
There's a lot of waiting
in hospitals, huh?

13:49.277 --> 13:50.612
I don't like it.

13:51.745 --> 13:53.613
I don't like all the
sick people either.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.614
How can that be
a good thing,

13:55.616 --> 13:57.483
putting all the sick
people together?

13:57.485 --> 13:59.721
How is that gonna
make anybody better?

14:01.155 --> 14:02.220
Depressing.

14:02.222 --> 14:04.357
I don't think
I could do it.

14:04.359 --> 14:06.795
If you had to do it,
you'd have to do it.

14:08.196 --> 14:10.496
Hospitals
remind me of death.

14:10.498 --> 14:12.668
- Lovely.
- You know what I mean.

14:14.501 --> 14:17.637
So, if I have to come in,
you won't come and visit me?

14:17.639 --> 14:20.605
They're not gonna bring
you in just for a cyst.

14:20.607 --> 14:22.743
All I know is
it felt serious.

14:23.778 --> 14:26.648
That's because of all the
other sick people around you.

14:28.649 --> 14:31.552
You see the nonsense
you talk?

14:32.386 --> 14:33.719
How do you
get through life?

14:33.721 --> 14:35.655
All right.
You're still here with me.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.324
I'm just doing that
out of spite.

14:38.326 --> 14:40.560
Right back at you,
kid.

14:40.562 --> 14:42.828
I realize it's been a very
long day for both of you.

14:42.830 --> 14:45.665
We would have liked to have been
able to give you a firm answer,

14:45.667 --> 14:48.401
but we can't tell yet
what we're dealing with.

14:48.403 --> 14:50.268
What are all the tests
about then?

14:50.270 --> 14:51.369
- Tom.
- Yeah, I know.

14:51.371 --> 14:53.705
I realize
it's very frustrating.

14:53.707 --> 14:56.275
We found some cells
that are concerning.

14:56.277 --> 15:01.446
On a scale of one to five, one being it
isn't cancerous and five being it is,

15:01.448 --> 15:03.551
at the moment,
we're sitting at three.

15:12.894 --> 15:15.761
Do you wanna go out for
something to eat tonight?

15:15.763 --> 15:17.331
Thai or something?

15:18.633 --> 15:19.735
Um...

15:20.769 --> 15:23.969
No, I've already taken
the chops out for dinner.

15:23.971 --> 15:25.374
I just thought...

15:26.441 --> 15:28.644
I know.
I'm all right.

15:30.611 --> 15:32.813
I know.
Baby, it wasn't...

15:35.350 --> 15:36.851
Breaks the day up.

15:38.586 --> 15:40.656
No, I want
to cook the chops.

16:34.075 --> 16:35.807
- She doesn't know.
- Oh.

16:35.809 --> 16:38.643
You'd think that would be the
type of thing they would know.

16:38.645 --> 16:41.682
- Did you tell her your stroke scenario?
- Oh, yes.

16:43.484 --> 16:45.383
We need
tomato juice.

16:45.385 --> 16:46.786
That's
the next aisle.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.490
I know that.
I'm just saying we need it.

16:50.490 --> 16:52.023
You drink too much
tomato juice.

16:52.025 --> 16:55.060
That stuff made from
concentrate is full of sugar.

16:55.062 --> 16:57.696
They used to have the stuff
that isn't concentrate,

16:57.698 --> 16:59.634
but they don't
have it anymore.

17:00.668 --> 17:03.404
I like tomato juice.

17:04.538 --> 17:06.638
Why don't you just
eat more tomatoes?

17:06.641 --> 17:09.808
What's wrong with you?
Eat more tomatoes!

17:09.810 --> 17:12.344
I'm just saying.

17:12.346 --> 17:15.680
We should buy a juicer.
Then you could make your own tomato juice.

17:15.682 --> 17:17.949
What's the chances
of that happening?

17:17.951 --> 17:20.786
It would just sit there beside
a bowl of rotten tomatoes

17:20.788 --> 17:23.122
and a carton
of tomato juice.

17:23.124 --> 17:25.760
Well, it wouldn't
if you'd use it.

17:26.861 --> 17:28.728
Hold on till I get
this right here.

17:28.730 --> 17:30.830
We're having some
type of an argument

17:30.832 --> 17:34.767
about the frequency of me
using a juicer we don't own.

17:34.769 --> 17:38.970
No, I'm just saying, if you had
it, then you should use it.

17:38.972 --> 17:40.975
Aye, very good.

17:44.479 --> 17:46.882
What's gonna happen
if I've got cancer?

17:49.817 --> 17:52.384
You don't know
that you do.

17:52.386 --> 17:53.621
If.

17:54.588 --> 17:58.923
She said on a scale of one to
five, it's three.

17:58.925 --> 18:02.495
I don't think she would have said
that if it was gonna be five.

18:02.497 --> 18:05.029
Three is closer to five
than it is to one.

18:05.031 --> 18:06.899
No, it isn't.

18:06.901 --> 18:11.670
It isn't, but in your head,
three is closer to five than it is to one.

18:11.672 --> 18:14.472
I don't know why,
but you know what I mean. It is.

18:14.474 --> 18:15.644
It isn't.

18:18.645 --> 18:21.482
Well, what's gonna happen
if I've got cancer?

18:24.519 --> 18:26.184
There's no point
in thinking like that now.

18:26.186 --> 18:29.421
You don't know.
You can't do anything until you know.

18:29.423 --> 18:31.190
I know.

18:31.192 --> 18:32.792
I know I've got it.

18:32.794 --> 18:34.459
So you're
a doctor now?

18:34.461 --> 18:37.196
You don't have to be a doctor
to know things like that.

18:37.198 --> 18:39.097
Yes, you do.

18:39.099 --> 18:43.568
I know that three is closer to five,
and I know I've got breast cancer.

18:43.570 --> 18:46.807
Okay. Well,
what are you gonna do then?

18:48.108 --> 18:49.909
I don't know.

18:49.911 --> 18:53.782
Correct. Because you can't do
anything because you don't know.

18:54.648 --> 18:56.751
Well, that's not
an answer.

18:59.921 --> 19:00.922
Joan...

19:04.491 --> 19:07.927
If you have breast cancer,
which I don't think you do...

19:07.929 --> 19:10.930
if you have
breast cancer,

19:10.932 --> 19:13.699
we will do whatever
has to be done,

19:13.701 --> 19:15.200
the two of us.

19:15.202 --> 19:16.971
That's what's
gonna happen.

19:29.483 --> 19:31.016
I have to go
to the toilet.

19:31.018 --> 19:34.823
- Don't be long. I might be called.
- I'll be as long as it takes.

19:56.743 --> 19:58.846
Mrs. Joan Thompson?

20:07.020 --> 20:09.057
- Joan?
- Yes.

20:10.124 --> 20:12.624
Sorry. I'm just waiting
on my husband.

20:12.626 --> 20:14.729
- He's at the toilet.
- Of course.

20:20.734 --> 20:21.936
There he is.

20:24.038 --> 20:26.238
We've been able
to look at your biopsy results,

20:26.240 --> 20:29.607
and I'm afraid it's not the news
we were hoping for.

20:29.609 --> 20:31.512
It does show
that there is cancer.

20:35.583 --> 20:37.982
We'll talk today
about the road ahead.

20:37.984 --> 20:40.888
I think we should start
chemotherapy in the next weeks.

20:41.622 --> 20:43.021
This would mean
a first surgery

20:43.023 --> 20:45.290
to remove the lump
and any lymph glands involved,

20:45.292 --> 20:46.961
followed by chemo.

20:47.994 --> 20:50.161
To reduce the risk of recurrence
in your situation,

20:50.163 --> 20:54.065
we'll discuss a further surgery
to remove both breasts.

20:54.067 --> 20:57.638
And, of course,
your options for reconstruction.

21:44.218 --> 21:45.954
Joan.

21:47.253 --> 21:48.889
Joan!

21:50.290 --> 21:54.826
Come on, kid. No point in lying there.
Come on. Let's get you up to bed.

21:54.828 --> 21:58.229
All right.
Good man.

21:58.231 --> 22:00.835
All right. One, two, three. Hup!

22:02.303 --> 22:03.802
Oh.

22:03.804 --> 22:05.206
That's it.

22:43.309 --> 22:45.346
I love you.

22:58.425 --> 23:00.794
This is gonna
sound strange.

23:01.429 --> 23:03.131
I'm sure it won't.

23:06.299 --> 23:09.770
I'm glad our Debbie isn't
here to go through this.

23:13.773 --> 23:16.777
I mean, I miss her
every day, but...

23:18.778 --> 23:20.882
this would
break her heart.

23:26.487 --> 23:28.123
Look at me.

23:29.423 --> 23:30.924
Tom.

23:33.493 --> 23:35.896
Joan, look at me.

23:40.233 --> 23:42.334
Don't make me cry.

23:42.336 --> 23:45.906
There isn't a moment
I won't be there with you.

23:46.807 --> 23:48.242
I know.

23:49.477 --> 23:51.075
I'm gonna torture you.

23:51.077 --> 23:53.077
You know that, don't you?

23:53.079 --> 23:56.215
- You torture me now.
- Good.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.219
You know what
to expect then.

23:59.953 --> 24:01.953
I'm frightened.

24:01.955 --> 24:03.891
I know, kid.
I know.

24:05.893 --> 24:07.828
Every moment.

24:10.330 --> 24:13.067
Go on, eat your toast
before it gets cold.

24:51.806 --> 24:55.073
We should've left earlier.
It's an operation. You can't be late.

24:55.075 --> 24:56.443
We won't be late.

24:58.278 --> 25:02.150
- It's only a fish.
- You still have to feed it.

25:03.450 --> 25:05.953
- Flush it.
- Flush you.

25:06.554 --> 25:09.090
Very good.

25:12.459 --> 25:14.026
How long does it take?

25:14.028 --> 25:15.227
How long
does what take?

25:15.229 --> 25:18.296
- The operation.
- Oh, I don't know.

25:18.298 --> 25:19.200
Hours.

25:20.567 --> 25:23.035
You've got plenty
of time to go to the grave.

25:23.037 --> 25:26.238
- I wanna be there when you get out.
- Tom, it's her birthday.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.978
We always go to the grave on her birthday.
You'll have time.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.016
Tell her I'm sorry
I'm not there,

25:38.018 --> 25:39.985
- but don't tell her why.
- Joan...

25:39.987 --> 25:42.019
That's the way
I have to think about it.

25:42.021 --> 25:43.490
Am I not
allowed to do that?

25:49.329 --> 25:53.599
If I was there I'd say it,
but I'm not there, so you can say it.

25:53.601 --> 25:56.301
If you were there, you wouldn't
have to say you weren't there.

25:56.303 --> 25:58.202
Tom, everything
isn't a joke!

25:58.204 --> 25:59.971
- Joan, she's dead.
- I know.

25:59.973 --> 26:02.176
How can I not
know that?

26:06.913 --> 26:09.648
Just do it, Tom, please.
Just do it.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.052
Sorry.

26:12.519 --> 26:14.087
Of course I will.

26:14.989 --> 26:16.257
Sorry.

26:16.957 --> 26:19.494
It's all right.
It's fine.

26:33.106 --> 26:35.242
- Right.
- Yeah.

26:38.612 --> 26:41.979
It'll be over in no time.
I'll be back here waiting for you.

26:41.981 --> 26:43.151
I know.

26:44.317 --> 26:47.588
All right, kid.

26:49.189 --> 26:51.392
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

26:52.660 --> 26:54.394
Go on then.

27:02.269 --> 27:04.137
Door closing.

27:27.027 --> 27:29.230
Happy birthday, love.

27:30.698 --> 27:34.569
Your mother says she's sorry
she can't be here since...

27:37.738 --> 27:39.470
Look, Debbie,
this is...

27:39.472 --> 27:42.442
this is...
this is crazy. This...

27:43.376 --> 27:46.446
This isn't how I see you.
You're not here.

27:47.647 --> 27:51.051
All I'm doing here is
talking to a bit of stone.

27:55.455 --> 27:58.125
Your mother
has breast cancer.

27:59.460 --> 28:02.227
She told me
not to tell you that.

28:02.229 --> 28:03.461
And I can understand why.

28:03.463 --> 28:06.600
She... she doesn't
want you to worry.

28:08.134 --> 28:12.472
But I imagine if you're looking down on
us, you heard that conversation, so...

28:13.740 --> 28:18.211
It's just helping her
get through it, that's all.

28:19.078 --> 28:21.415
Protecting you
makes her stronger.

28:23.217 --> 28:25.017
She found out
about a month ago.

28:25.019 --> 28:27.651
She's having an operation
today to remove the lumps.

28:27.653 --> 28:32.224
So they'll know more after that,
how serious the situation is.

28:32.226 --> 28:34.092
I mean,
it's serious now.

28:34.094 --> 28:36.230
I mean,
cancer is cancer.

28:42.236 --> 28:43.471
I just...

28:44.538 --> 28:47.375
I just can't tell her
how frightened I am.

28:53.446 --> 28:56.483
Just got to continue on
as normal.

28:57.617 --> 29:00.288
I suppose that's my job
in all this.

29:01.387 --> 29:03.323
That's all you can do.

29:08.528 --> 29:11.265
I couldn't have
the both of you gone.

29:12.633 --> 29:14.602
I'd just be...

29:15.536 --> 29:17.138
adrift.

29:20.273 --> 29:22.743
How do you say to someone,
"Don't die"?

29:38.659 --> 29:41.729
- Everything okay with you today?
- Yes, fine, thank you.

29:45.665 --> 29:47.565
Everything is
running to schedule,

29:47.567 --> 29:50.504
so you should all
be brought down in order.

29:54.575 --> 29:57.275
You'd think they'd know which
one they were going to work on

29:57.277 --> 29:59.180
without having to put
a mark on it.

30:02.816 --> 30:04.548
- I'm starving.
- So am I.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.017
Me too.

30:06.019 --> 30:09.854
They should be able to give you a
tablet that makes you feel not starving.

30:09.856 --> 30:11.425
Or a vodka.

30:13.192 --> 30:16.596
Here we go.
More stitches somewhere.

30:18.365 --> 30:21.335
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

30:21.902 --> 30:24.305
Shouldn't be
long now.

30:31.377 --> 30:33.478
Have you had chemo
before?

30:33.480 --> 30:36.750
- Twice.
- What's it like?

30:37.584 --> 30:39.620
Second one
wasn't so bad.

30:40.420 --> 30:41.622
First one was rough.

30:43.323 --> 30:45.757
It doesn't last,
and you get through it.

30:45.759 --> 30:48.628
Sometimes you feel like you
won't, but you do.

30:50.530 --> 30:53.498
Take every tablet
they give you and more.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.867
And always remember,
when you're at your worst,

30:56.869 --> 30:59.506
what you're going through is
better than the alternative.

31:05.378 --> 31:07.747
- Good luck.
- And you.

32:57.958 --> 32:59.860
You smell lovely.

33:02.061 --> 33:04.464
I try my best.

33:20.513 --> 33:23.315
I was able to remove
the whole tumor.

33:23.317 --> 33:25.616
Now, it wasn't
two lumps.

33:25.618 --> 33:28.319
They were joined,
so we consider that to be one lump.

33:28.321 --> 33:29.653
Right.

33:29.655 --> 33:32.657
Also, because the lymph
nodes were involved,

33:32.659 --> 33:35.526
- I had to remove 13 of those.
- Oh.

33:35.528 --> 33:39.064
And we'll also have to check
it hasn't spread anywhere else.

33:39.066 --> 33:40.931
Where?

33:40.933 --> 33:43.434
We'll do
a bone scan.

33:43.436 --> 33:49.074
We also need to check your
liver and lungs with a CT scan.

33:49.076 --> 33:52.776
Was the lump the size that
normally means it's spread?

33:52.778 --> 33:54.949
There is
no normal here.

33:56.048 --> 33:57.550
We got it.

33:58.518 --> 34:00.587
That all
looks good.

34:07.661 --> 34:08.929
What'd she say?

34:10.096 --> 34:14.565
Um, they got it all,
but it was bigger than they thought.

34:14.568 --> 34:17.068
- Bone scan?
- Yes.

34:17.070 --> 34:18.438
Oh.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.574
That's normal.

36:35.175 --> 36:36.710
Excuse me.

36:45.184 --> 36:48.121
Can you kill a goldfish
by overfeeding them?

36:51.023 --> 36:52.592
I don't know.

36:53.626 --> 36:55.128
I've only started
working here.

36:56.563 --> 36:57.831
I only know
about rabbits.

36:58.864 --> 37:02.001
- Are they old?
- No.

37:04.304 --> 37:07.708
I don't want the wife to
know the one we had died.

37:09.842 --> 37:12.142
Was she fond
of it?

37:12.144 --> 37:15.114
No.
She hated it.

37:31.030 --> 37:32.963
- You all right to walk?
- Fine.

37:32.965 --> 37:35.702
- Bye. I'm on my way now.
- See you.

38:48.775 --> 38:50.177
Thank you.

38:59.152 --> 39:00.851
And what?

39:00.853 --> 39:04.255
You got everything
means you got everything.

39:04.257 --> 39:08.358
No, they did a bone scan to see if
the cancer had spread to my bones.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.994
And that was clear.

39:09.996 --> 39:12.095
Correct. But now you have
to get an upper-body scan.

39:12.097 --> 39:13.097
- Yes.
- Why?

39:13.099 --> 39:15.166
Because she wants to check
my liver and my lungs.

39:15.168 --> 39:18.001
Why didn't she check your lungs
when she was removing the lump?

39:18.003 --> 39:20.037
I don't know.
She can't just put her hand in,

39:20.039 --> 39:21.838
move things out of the
way and take a peek.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.909
How do you know they don't do that?
Are you a doctor now?

39:24.911 --> 39:26.411
Stop talking stupid.

39:26.413 --> 39:29.146
Get cancer and end up knowing
everything about medicine.

39:29.148 --> 39:31.715
All I know is there's something
they're not telling us.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.351
There's nothing they're not telling us.
Why are you doing this?

39:34.353 --> 39:37.054
Up to the damn hospital
again and again and again.

39:37.056 --> 39:39.691
Well, you don't have to
come with me all the time.

39:39.693 --> 39:42.360
- What would you do on your own?
- I'd do what I always do.

39:42.362 --> 39:44.762
I sit and wait and then I
get poked and prodded at.

39:44.764 --> 39:49.068
And what if something happens
and I'm not there? No.

39:52.806 --> 39:54.271
Just drive the car.

39:54.273 --> 39:56.809
Aye, just drive the car.
That's me.

39:57.342 --> 39:59.045
Just drive the car.

40:04.451 --> 40:06.217
One.

40:06.219 --> 40:08.351
Two.

40:08.353 --> 40:10.722
Three.

40:10.724 --> 40:12.456
Four.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.458
Five.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.327
Six.

40:16.329 --> 40:17.331
Seven.

40:18.864 --> 40:20.465
Eight.

40:20.467 --> 40:22.766
Nine.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.334
Ten.

40:24.336 --> 40:25.970
Eleven.

40:25.972 --> 40:28.338
Twelve.

40:28.340 --> 40:29.941
Thirteen.

40:29.943 --> 40:32.146
Fourteen.

40:32.811 --> 40:34.445
Fifteen.

40:34.447 --> 40:36.380
Sixteen.

40:36.382 --> 40:38.483
Seventeen.

40:38.485 --> 40:40.351
Eighteen.

40:40.353 --> 40:42.220
Nineteen.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.224
Twenty.

40:45.090 --> 40:46.758
Twenty-one.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.525
Twenty-two.

40:48.527 --> 40:50.360
Twenty-three.

40:50.362 --> 40:52.398
Twenty-four.

40:58.371 --> 41:00.838
She's been away too long.
That's not good.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.010
Not good what way?

41:04.043 --> 41:07.244
Because if it was good
news, she'd be right back.

41:07.246 --> 41:11.983
So you think it's bad news and she doesn't
wanna tell you and she's waiting out there?

41:11.985 --> 41:13.351
That's what I think.

41:13.353 --> 41:17.088
Oh, I think it's good
news, so she's in no rush.

41:17.090 --> 41:19.157
No, if it was good news,
you'd be in a rush.

41:19.159 --> 41:22.927
That's the whole point.
You'd want to be telling the person.

41:22.929 --> 41:25.463
It'd be cruel if you had good
news to wait to tell someone.

41:25.465 --> 41:29.133
It'd be kind if you had bad
news to wait to tell them.

41:29.135 --> 41:31.302
She's been away too long.
It's bad news.

41:31.304 --> 41:34.171
Sorry.
That took longer than I thought.

41:34.173 --> 41:36.376
I was called away
to another patient.

41:40.380 --> 41:44.318
Well, good news.
The scan is all clear.

41:49.155 --> 41:50.554
So what does
that mean?

41:50.556 --> 41:54.458
It means we've removed the
lump and the lymph nodes,

41:54.460 --> 41:56.860
and the cancer hasn't
spread anywhere else.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.329
So, it's gone?

41:58.331 --> 42:01.298
As far as
we're concerned, yes.

42:01.300 --> 42:04.302
And the next thing is to
refer you to an oncologist

42:04.304 --> 42:07.037
to discuss chemotherapy
and other therapies.

42:07.039 --> 42:09.942
Why chemo?
You just said it was gone.

42:10.909 --> 42:13.911
There still might be
tiny cancerous cells

42:13.913 --> 42:15.512
that we can't detect
through scanning.

42:15.514 --> 42:20.450
So... when you said the cancer is
gone, that may not be true?

42:20.452 --> 42:23.487
- Tom, don't...
- I just want to get everything clear.

42:23.489 --> 42:24.921
And so you should.

42:24.923 --> 42:27.224
The cancer that was there
has been removed

42:27.226 --> 42:29.427
and it hasn't spread
any further.

42:29.429 --> 42:33.099
And Joan is now ready
for chemotherapy.

42:34.067 --> 42:36.469
Thank you, Doctor.
That's very clear. Thank you.

42:42.608 --> 42:46.279
From now on, when we're at the
hospital, I don't want you talking.

42:47.380 --> 42:50.514
If I didn't talk,
we wouldn't know anything.

42:50.516 --> 42:53.387
We already knew.
We'd already been told.

42:54.186 --> 42:55.454
It's just you
being you.

42:56.088 --> 42:57.320
Cancer-free,
she said.

42:57.322 --> 42:59.492
Yes. I knew
what she meant.

43:01.393 --> 43:04.595
In situations like this,
you have to be exact.

43:04.597 --> 43:08.535
Oh, I'm sorry, Tom. Are we in a
hospital or are we in a courtroom?

43:09.469 --> 43:12.036
It's not black and white.
The world's gray.

43:12.038 --> 43:14.240
It's nothing to do
with black and white.

43:15.340 --> 43:18.008
Cancer-free is different
from not cancer-free.

43:18.010 --> 43:21.148
Hmm.
Are you cancer free?

43:22.114 --> 43:24.081
Very good.

43:24.083 --> 43:26.182
"As far as we know."

43:26.184 --> 43:28.519
I knew what
she meant.

43:28.521 --> 43:31.121
So from now on,
no more talk from you.

43:31.123 --> 43:33.157
It's to do with me anyway.
I'll ask.

43:33.159 --> 43:35.059
It's to do with you.
You'll ask.

43:35.061 --> 43:37.231
Yes. That was
embarrassing.

43:37.664 --> 43:39.566
- Embarrassing?
- Yes.

44:04.324 --> 44:06.393
- You wanna sit here?
- Yeah.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.740
You see that man in the
blue shirt over there?

44:23.742 --> 44:25.376
Yeah.

44:25.378 --> 44:28.545
I think he was our Debbie's
teacher at primary school.

44:28.547 --> 44:30.583
Oh, right enough.

44:31.617 --> 44:34.284
- Yes, arrogant.
- Yeah.

44:34.286 --> 44:37.454
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- What for?

44:37.456 --> 44:40.490
What for? There's something
the matter with you.

44:40.492 --> 44:44.228
Just to talk to him.
Tell him who I am, that I recognized him.

44:44.230 --> 44:46.065
He looks alone.

44:49.601 --> 44:51.304
Sorry.

44:52.405 --> 44:57.041
I just saw you sitting here.
I think I know you.

44:57.043 --> 45:01.012
Did you used to teach my daughter,
Debbie Thompson, in primary school?

45:01.014 --> 45:02.582
I did.

45:03.516 --> 45:07.017
I was very sad to hear
what happened to Debbie.

45:07.019 --> 45:08.719
Oh.

45:08.721 --> 45:09.787
It's Joan.

45:09.789 --> 45:11.421
Peter.

45:11.423 --> 45:13.356
Debbie was
a delightful child.

45:13.358 --> 45:15.226
Pleasure to teach.

45:15.228 --> 45:19.095
- Hmm. Do you still teach?
- Not at the moment.

45:19.097 --> 45:21.400
Oh, please, sit down.

45:23.402 --> 45:25.269
Are you
on your own?

45:25.271 --> 45:28.171
Oh, my partner, Steve,
is downstairs in the café.

45:28.173 --> 45:31.508
He gets
very emotional.

45:31.510 --> 45:35.112
- It's difficult for him.
- Hmm. I see that in my husband.

45:35.114 --> 45:38.585
Right. So you have
the buzzer?

45:39.652 --> 45:42.753
- Yes. Yeah.
- Right.

45:42.755 --> 45:44.688
Is this your
first time here?

45:44.690 --> 45:46.389
No, second.

45:46.391 --> 45:48.594
How's your treatment
going?

45:49.661 --> 45:52.131
I'm... I'm terminal.

45:52.831 --> 45:54.164
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:54.166 --> 45:56.367
Yeah. They say
if I take the chemo,

45:56.369 --> 45:58.436
we'll have
a while longer.

45:58.438 --> 46:00.507
What... What are you
here for?

46:01.673 --> 46:03.376
Breast cancer.

46:06.579 --> 46:08.782
Has the chemo
been difficult?

46:09.514 --> 46:11.282
Difficult enough.
The nausea.

46:11.284 --> 46:14.452
That might not be difficult for you.
Each treatment's different.

46:14.454 --> 46:16.323
They say that,
anyway.

46:18.157 --> 46:22.392
I don't wanna lose my hair. No hair at
my age, I think I'd look like a man.

46:22.394 --> 46:26.597
For me they said
maybe, maybe not.

46:26.599 --> 46:29.099
I do not want
to be buried bald.

46:29.101 --> 46:30.333
Actually,
that's not true.

46:30.335 --> 46:31.869
Being buried bald
isn't the issue.

46:31.871 --> 46:35.271
Lying in me coffin with the lid off
it, bald, for all to see.

46:35.273 --> 46:40.313
Not that there will be anybody there,
but that's not the point. Just in case.

46:41.547 --> 46:43.315
I think you'd look
dignified.

46:44.182 --> 46:46.383
Dignified?
No, horrified.

46:49.422 --> 46:51.856
Well, you might not
lose it.

46:51.858 --> 46:54.728
Whenever they say "you
might," it means you will.

46:56.429 --> 47:00.467
We should get that printed on T-shirts.
Wear them to the chemo sessions.

47:05.304 --> 47:08.508
Well... there we go.

47:10.208 --> 47:11.407
- Okay.
- Well...

47:11.409 --> 47:13.577
It's lovely
to meet you, Peter.

47:13.579 --> 47:15.646
I'm glad
I came over to talk.

47:15.648 --> 47:17.617
Yeah. Lovely to meet you, Joan.

47:22.621 --> 47:24.454
I take it
that's him then?

47:24.456 --> 47:27.594
Yeah.
His name's Peter.

47:28.661 --> 47:31.528
- Did he remember our Debbie?
- Of course he did.

47:31.530 --> 47:33.632
Talked of her
really fondly.

47:34.400 --> 47:38.472
- Is he still arrogant?
- Huh. No.

47:39.338 --> 47:41.508
He's got
terminal cancer.

47:42.175 --> 47:43.443
Oh.

47:44.277 --> 47:46.480
- That's not good.
- No.

47:47.480 --> 47:50.313
His partner, Steve,
I think he said he was called,

47:50.315 --> 47:53.586
he sits downstairs.
He can't come up here.

47:55.755 --> 47:57.054
Yeah.

47:57.056 --> 48:00.493
I can imagine that would be
difficult for some people, all right.

48:04.230 --> 48:05.865
I hope I bump
into him again.

48:06.532 --> 48:08.398
I'm sure you will.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.302
He doesn't look gay.

48:10.936 --> 48:12.471
No.

48:13.773 --> 48:16.409
- But then you don't look...
- Easy, tiger.

48:17.543 --> 48:19.713
I was gonna say
kind.

48:20.545 --> 48:23.349
- There's not many of us left.
- Hmm.

48:25.217 --> 48:27.985
I couldn't say stupid
because you do look stupid.

48:27.987 --> 48:31.657
Living with you too long
has me looking like that.

48:35.427 --> 48:37.695
Oh!

48:37.697 --> 48:39.865
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

50:01.347 --> 50:03.079
It's all right,
it's all right.

50:03.081 --> 50:04.784
Oh, God.

50:05.985 --> 50:08.922
Is your head sore?
Shall I get a cold cloth?

50:10.056 --> 50:11.724
No, I'm freezing.

50:12.525 --> 50:14.791
Blanket?
Want a blanket?

50:14.793 --> 50:17.396
No, it'll be all right.
It'll go in a minute.

50:18.864 --> 50:23.903
Shall I take this... this basin away
and clean it out or is there more?

50:24.936 --> 50:27.938
There will be more, but you
can clean it out anyway.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.807
Shall I go and just
get another basin?

50:30.809 --> 50:33.443
No, just... just clean
that one out.

50:33.445 --> 50:34.913
Right, right, right.

50:48.561 --> 50:51.998
Sarah has started a
project at nearby Fillingham Court.

50:52.898 --> 50:54.965
She's teaching the residents
about gardening

50:54.967 --> 50:58.568
to inspire them to make the
most of their communal areas

50:58.570 --> 51:00.838
and brighten up
their balconies.

51:00.840 --> 51:04.577
What rubbish bin goes out tonight?
Brown or gray?

51:07.445 --> 51:09.014
I'm not sure.

51:10.382 --> 51:12.081
What went out
last week?

51:12.083 --> 51:16.522
If I knew what went out last week,
I'd know what one goes out tonight.

51:17.389 --> 51:18.891
Think it's gray.

51:20.559 --> 51:22.729
Just look what
the neighbors put out.

51:24.463 --> 51:26.063
I know it's summer,
but what's the point

51:26.065 --> 51:28.664
of having a bin for garden
waste during the winter

51:28.666 --> 51:30.633
when there isn't
any garden waste?

51:30.635 --> 51:31.838
Don't know.

51:32.737 --> 51:34.070
Well,
you should know.

51:34.072 --> 51:36.608
That could be vital
information at some point.

51:37.476 --> 51:40.778
- Vital? Really?
- Yes, Joan. Vital.

51:40.780 --> 51:43.717
- Why don't you go for a walk?
- No.

51:44.784 --> 51:46.749
No, I'm staying.
Watch TV.

51:46.751 --> 51:48.987
I haven't numbed my
brain enough today.

51:52.458 --> 51:53.626
Hmm.

52:30.663 --> 52:33.867
- All right?
- It's coming out in clumps now.

52:36.768 --> 52:38.637
What do you want
to do?

52:39.938 --> 52:42.206
- I don't know.
- Look, there's no...

52:42.208 --> 52:46.813
- No, I know.
- I'll do it. Do you want me to do it?

52:49.815 --> 52:52.117
What?
Where's the scissors?

52:54.786 --> 52:56.655
- In the drawer.
- Right.

53:02.862 --> 53:04.728
Do you wanna
stand or sit?

53:04.730 --> 53:08.635
When have you ever seen anyone
getting their hair cut standing up?

53:27.887 --> 53:29.022
Okay?

53:30.054 --> 53:31.089
Yeah.

53:42.967 --> 53:44.736
Stop.

53:50.842 --> 53:54.077
So, what do you and your
hairdresser talk about?

53:54.079 --> 53:56.112
You and what
an idiot you are.

53:56.114 --> 53:59.051
An idiot who has a pair
of scissors in his hand.

53:59.918 --> 54:02.184
Any particular style
today, madam?

54:02.186 --> 54:04.490
Beehive.

54:05.023 --> 54:07.590
Showing your age
there, kid.

54:07.592 --> 54:09.761
A beehive it is.

55:15.793 --> 55:18.764
Ta-da!

55:22.001 --> 55:23.967
What do you
think?

55:23.969 --> 55:26.005
You look
beautiful.

55:27.039 --> 55:29.943
But then I never really liked
your hair to begin with.

55:33.878 --> 55:36.213
It feels weird.

55:36.215 --> 55:37.914
You're a star, kid.

55:37.916 --> 55:39.986
Absolute star.

57:58.023 --> 57:59.990
- Did you write it down?
- No.

57:59.992 --> 58:02.124
What do you mean,
no?

58:02.126 --> 58:04.860
I gave you a notebook and
a pen especially for that.

58:04.862 --> 58:07.065
I didn't
write it down.

58:09.001 --> 58:12.034
So, you don't know
what tablet to take?

58:12.036 --> 58:13.336
No. Just guess.

58:13.338 --> 58:15.438
You can't guess, Joan.
They're too strong.

58:15.440 --> 58:18.809
Tom, please.
The pain in my legs and feet is...

58:18.811 --> 58:22.012
I'm in agony. Just give me a tablet.
It's one of three.

58:22.014 --> 58:23.979
Just pick one.
I don't care which.

58:23.981 --> 58:26.449
- You were told to write this down.
- Oh, what?

58:26.451 --> 58:28.552
Because I didn't,
you're gonna punish me?

58:28.554 --> 58:32.421
Whose pain is this?
Who's going through this? Me or you?

58:32.423 --> 58:36.293
You sit downstairs drinking
beer while I'm up here in pain.

58:36.295 --> 58:38.561
Excuse me.
Everything you need, I get.

58:38.563 --> 58:42.298
- Well, get me a tablet.
- I don't know which one.

58:42.300 --> 58:45.202
Don't give me that "poor me" garbage.
Did I give you the cancer?

58:45.204 --> 58:47.037
This isn't about cancer.
This is about you.

58:47.039 --> 58:50.039
You never do anything for me
until you've sorted yourself out.

58:50.041 --> 58:51.441
- That right?
- Yes.

58:51.443 --> 58:53.510
I didn't want to fill out
your silly little notepad

58:53.512 --> 58:56.012
because I didn't
feel like it, all right?

58:56.014 --> 58:58.315
No! Because you like
all this.

58:58.317 --> 59:00.450
You'd rather be worse
than better.

59:00.452 --> 59:01.650
It's in your nature.

59:01.652 --> 59:04.920
It's all, "Look at me.
This was always gonna happen to me!

59:04.922 --> 59:07.526
My daughter was killed!
Look at me!"

59:10.228 --> 59:11.994
I hate you,
you know that?

59:11.996 --> 59:15.331
Oh, I know it, all right.
It's there underneath all the time.

59:15.333 --> 59:18.934
Here, there's the box.
You wanna take a tablet? Take one.

59:18.936 --> 59:20.202
Just leave me alone.

59:20.204 --> 59:22.405
On top of everything
I have to deal with you.

59:22.407 --> 59:24.173
We're both
going through this.

59:24.175 --> 59:27.346
No, we're not! Tom, we're not!
I'm going through it!

59:29.213 --> 59:32.148
You've just gotta cope with
things, cope with stuff.

59:32.150 --> 59:34.950
I had the cancer.
I'm going through chemo.

59:34.952 --> 59:37.489
I need to have
a double-mastectomy.

59:40.626 --> 59:42.992
I'm doing my best here!

59:42.994 --> 59:45.130
No, you're not!

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:19.465
Hi.

01:00:20.398 --> 01:00:21.534
Hi.

01:00:24.101 --> 01:00:26.036
Is this
your first session?

01:00:26.038 --> 01:00:28.003
Yes.

01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:31.141
Don't be worried about all the
goings-on here. You get used to it.

01:00:31.143 --> 01:00:33.943
You think you won't,
but you do.

01:00:33.945 --> 01:00:37.482
I always think it's like a busy
train station or something.

01:00:38.483 --> 01:00:39.518
Yeah.

01:00:41.018 --> 01:00:43.153
How many sessions
have you to do?

01:00:43.155 --> 01:00:45.688
- Six.
- Oh.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:49.027
- Breast cancer.
- Same here.

01:00:50.061 --> 01:00:51.327
I hear it's hard.

01:00:51.329 --> 01:00:54.366
Well, it can be,
but you get through it.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.471
Take all the painkillers
you can get your hands on.

01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:03.209
Once the pain kicks in,
it's hard to get rid of.

01:01:07.746 --> 01:01:10.182
Now, are we ready?

01:01:18.356 --> 01:01:20.523
Yeah, I like it.
It suits you.

01:01:20.525 --> 01:01:22.258
No, it doesn't.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.126
No, it doesn't.

01:01:24.128 --> 01:01:28.331
I went to the hairdresser's and she cut it.
I think it looks worse.

01:01:28.333 --> 01:01:30.269
It's not even
the right color.

01:01:31.235 --> 01:01:34.336
- What does Tom think of it?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:38.608
I mean, he wouldn't say
that he didn't like it,

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:40.512
but you know...

01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:44.347
He's at the end
of his tether.

01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:46.218
I can see it in him.

01:01:47.219 --> 01:01:49.686
Oh, but to hell
with him, so am I.

01:01:49.688 --> 01:01:52.188
Too right.

01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:54.624
- We fought the other night.
- Hmm?

01:01:54.626 --> 01:01:58.297
Oh, well, you need a
blowout, don't you?

01:01:59.264 --> 01:02:01.498
Steve won't do it,
not that he's that type,

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:05.103
but even so, God,
he won't offend me now.

01:02:06.237 --> 01:02:08.204
Poor man.

01:02:08.206 --> 01:02:10.373
He looks frightened,
you know.

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:12.508
More frightened
of me dying than I am.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:16.282
He won't even talk to me
about stopping chemo.

01:02:17.148 --> 01:02:19.282
Are you going to?

01:02:19.284 --> 01:02:21.086
Well,
I'm thinking about it.

01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:25.554
I can handle it,
but what's the point of even doing that,

01:02:25.556 --> 01:02:29.059
if I'm gonna die the
same way no matter what?

01:02:29.061 --> 01:02:32.530
Steve thinks I'd be depriving
him of time spent together.

01:02:36.201 --> 01:02:38.336
What would you do?

01:02:41.206 --> 01:02:42.271
Don't know.

01:02:42.273 --> 01:02:44.710
You must've thought
about it

01:02:45.476 --> 01:02:47.512
when you heard
about the cancer.

01:02:50.215 --> 01:02:51.684
Yeah, I...

01:02:53.117 --> 01:02:55.320
Yeah, I thought that...

01:02:56.688 --> 01:02:58.557
if it came to that...

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:01.557
no matter how long
you'd been together,

01:03:01.559 --> 01:03:04.230
no matter how much
you love each other...

01:03:05.764 --> 01:03:09.668
it would have to be my
decision and my decision alone.

01:03:12.503 --> 01:03:14.706
I cried
when I thought that.

01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:20.278
You know, that we're
all just really...

01:03:22.313 --> 01:03:24.182
just on our own.

01:03:37.528 --> 01:03:38.461
Too hot.

01:03:38.463 --> 01:03:42.132
Jesus Christ.
Tea cozy?

01:03:42.134 --> 01:03:44.336
No!

01:03:47.472 --> 01:03:48.607
Oh...

01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:21.707
You'd think I'd give these
up, wouldn't you?

01:04:24.509 --> 01:04:27.545
But then what
would be the point?

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.454
Have you somebody
in here?

01:04:39.423 --> 01:04:41.657
My wife.
She's got breast cancer.

01:04:41.659 --> 01:04:43.862
She's getting chemo,
you know.

01:04:52.436 --> 01:04:54.706
They're good in here.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.539
They can't do anything
for me,

01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:00.445
but that doesn't mean
to say they're not good.

01:05:01.246 --> 01:05:04.349
Your wife will be
well looked after.

01:05:05.282 --> 01:05:06.652
Yes.

01:05:11.822 --> 01:05:13.658
My wife's dead.

01:05:17.494 --> 01:05:19.531
It's just as well.

01:05:30.942 --> 01:05:33.445
I can't do this, Tom.

01:05:36.447 --> 01:05:38.483
I can't take any more.

01:05:39.451 --> 01:05:41.853
It's all right, kid.
It's all right.

01:05:44.588 --> 01:05:46.759
I can't do it, Tom.

01:05:53.297 --> 01:05:54.463
Look at me.

01:05:54.465 --> 01:05:56.634
I don't want
to look at you.

01:06:00.905 --> 01:06:02.338
You're nearly there, pet.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.643
I don't want to be
nearly there, Tom.

01:06:05.577 --> 01:06:06.943
I don't wanna be
nearly there.

01:06:06.945 --> 01:06:10.349
I want it to be over.
I've had enough.

01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:20.759
You know...
you know the way...

01:06:22.494 --> 01:06:24.697
I always said
I'd do the marathon...

01:06:25.929 --> 01:06:27.863
and never did it?

01:06:27.865 --> 01:06:29.499
Useless.

01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:30.903
I'm useless.

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:34.405
I stand near
the finish line...

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.675
watching the people
cross that line...

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:40.446
one by one.

01:06:41.079 --> 01:06:42.948
Makes me wanna cry.

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:47.518
But it's...

01:06:48.519 --> 01:06:51.389
it's normal people
that are doing it.

01:06:53.023 --> 01:06:54.792
I never did it.

01:06:57.394 --> 01:06:58.963
You are doing it.

01:07:01.032 --> 01:07:03.769
You're coming up
to the finish line, Joan.

01:07:04.936 --> 01:07:06.838
You're nearly there, kid.

01:07:08.972 --> 01:07:10.842
You're gonna do it.

01:08:06.764 --> 01:08:09.701
I've been thinking we should
do something to the house.

01:08:11.001 --> 01:08:12.003
Like what?

01:08:13.103 --> 01:08:14.836
I don't know.

01:08:14.838 --> 01:08:16.872
Bedroom, kitchen.
I don't know, just a change.

01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:19.442
They don't need
change, Joan.

01:08:19.444 --> 01:08:21.510
Tom, we haven't
decorated since...

01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:23.812
And what?
There's only you and me in it.

01:08:23.814 --> 01:08:25.747
It doesn't mean
it shouldn't look well.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:28.116
It looks
well enough.

01:08:28.118 --> 01:08:29.785
We're doing the bedroom.

01:08:29.787 --> 01:08:31.488
Right.
Not the kitchen?

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:33.790
You think we should
do the kitchen?

01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:35.424
I don't think
we should do either.

01:08:35.426 --> 01:08:38.093
Right, we're doing the bedroom.
Something bright.

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.497
Aye.

01:08:41.131 --> 01:08:44.969
What are we doing after this?
Do you wanna go for a drink somewhere?

01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:48.974
No, we'll just go up
to the bedroom.

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:52.541
I'll nip over,
get some wine across the road.

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:53.809
It'll be cheaper.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.014
Now that we're saving
for an orange bedroom.

01:08:57.046 --> 01:08:59.749
We don't have
to have any drink at all.

01:08:59.751 --> 01:09:01.920
Aye, very good.

01:09:02.886 --> 01:09:04.553
Don't be getting
a lot of drink.

01:09:04.555 --> 01:09:06.188
I wasn't gonna
get a lot.

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:07.622
Don't start.

01:09:07.625 --> 01:09:10.759
I know, but, I mean,
we're here doing this.

01:09:10.761 --> 01:09:12.930
- We're having a good time.
- Yes.

01:09:55.939 --> 01:09:58.109
Are you going
to miss these?

01:10:01.112 --> 01:10:03.079
What? Really?

01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:05.848
- Now?
- Yes, now.

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:06.952
No.

01:10:07.985 --> 01:10:08.817
No?

01:10:08.819 --> 01:10:12.724
- What, is this a trick question?
- No.

01:10:15.627 --> 01:10:17.830
Are you gonna
miss them?

01:10:27.104 --> 01:10:28.673
No.

01:10:30.608 --> 01:10:32.607
You'll still
have something left.

01:10:32.609 --> 01:10:33.878
I know.

01:10:36.613 --> 01:10:39.884
But, I mean,
are you gonna miss them?

01:10:44.322 --> 01:10:45.724
Yes.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.194
Good man.

01:11:57.729 --> 01:11:59.794
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:59.796 --> 01:12:02.099
- What's the pain like today?
- Same.

01:12:02.966 --> 01:12:05.836
- You getting more painkillers?
- Yeah.

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:08.907
Did you sleep?

01:12:10.274 --> 01:12:11.843
Off and on.

01:12:12.976 --> 01:12:15.713
It's difficult to sleep
here, noise of the place.

01:12:16.713 --> 01:12:20.715
- How long did they say you'd be in for?
- At least a week.

01:12:20.717 --> 01:12:26.757
Got to make sure that the wound's clean
and under my arms are all drained.

01:12:27.658 --> 01:12:30.159
Do you need me
to bring anything up?

01:12:30.161 --> 01:12:31.360
Yeah.

01:12:31.362 --> 01:12:34.729
Can you go into the top drawer
and get my blue nightdress?

01:12:34.731 --> 01:12:36.132
Make sure
it's the blue one.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:39.003
The other one's a bit grubby.
And some knickers.

01:12:41.271 --> 01:12:43.138
Any type?

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.875
Crotchless?

01:12:47.712 --> 01:12:50.015
Don't make me laugh.
It hurts.

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:52.447
Not the crotchless
then?

01:12:52.449 --> 01:12:54.450
Oh, Tom!

01:12:54.452 --> 01:12:56.751
Sturdy gusset?

01:12:56.753 --> 01:12:58.957
Sturdy gusset.

01:13:01.158 --> 01:13:03.362
Couple of facecloths
as well.

01:13:04.194 --> 01:13:05.193
Anything else?

01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:08.100
Any other things that
aren't sexually romantic?

01:13:09.033 --> 01:13:12.170
No, just the sexually
romantic stuff.

01:13:16.373 --> 01:13:17.775
Hi.

01:13:18.309 --> 01:13:19.808
Tom, this is Peter.

01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:21.309
- Yes, of course.
- I told you.

01:13:21.311 --> 01:13:24.345
- Hi. Good to meet you.
- You too.

01:13:24.347 --> 01:13:28.353
I'm gonna go down to the café.
Let you two have a chat.

01:13:31.488 --> 01:13:33.455
Well, how about you, missus?

01:13:33.457 --> 01:13:38.059
They've removed both of my breasts
and they've reconstructed them.

01:13:38.061 --> 01:13:41.731
They pulled up some muscle
from my stomach to do it.

01:13:41.733 --> 01:13:45.070
I've got this great big scar across here.
It's like a zip.

01:13:46.436 --> 01:13:48.806
Well,
at least it's over.

01:13:51.809 --> 01:13:55.210
You know, at the start of all
this, I had this feeling

01:13:55.212 --> 01:13:58.880
that if I can get through it
all, that the experience of that,

01:13:58.882 --> 01:14:01.150
you know,
just going through it,

01:14:01.152 --> 01:14:03.355
it would somehow
change me.

01:14:05.856 --> 01:14:07.958
I don't think it has.

01:14:09.993 --> 01:14:12.197
I don't think
I want it to.

01:14:51.002 --> 01:14:53.438
You're Tom.
Joan's husband?

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:02.010
Peter is with Joan
up in the ward.

01:15:02.012 --> 01:15:03.481
Oh, right, yeah.

01:15:05.015 --> 01:15:09.285
I heard she was in for an operation.
I hope it all went well.

01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:12.257
In doctor speak,
as well as can be expected.

01:15:13.457 --> 01:15:16.228
I know. It's just never
a straight answer.

01:15:18.029 --> 01:15:20.298
- It's good that she got through it.
- Yeah.

01:15:22.432 --> 01:15:25.366
Peter's in because his
blood count is down.

01:15:25.368 --> 01:15:27.905
Aye, just keeping an eye on him.

01:15:32.376 --> 01:15:34.045
He's dying.

01:15:34.912 --> 01:15:36.148
You know that?

01:15:38.381 --> 01:15:39.917
Yes.

01:15:41.886 --> 01:15:43.518
I've stopped
the chemo.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.826
I knew I was going to do it.
I just took me time working round to it.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.463
I told Steve. I didn't talk
to him about it. I told him.

01:15:54.064 --> 01:15:55.966
That didn't
go down well.

01:15:57.635 --> 01:15:59.371
He'll come round.

01:16:00.238 --> 01:16:03.475
Well, he'll have to.
It's all about time now.

01:16:10.981 --> 01:16:13.318
He used to teach
my daughter.

01:16:14.652 --> 01:16:16.221
Aye. He said.

01:16:17.188 --> 01:16:19.257
I'm sorry to hear
what happened.

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:21.326
Yeah.

01:16:22.993 --> 01:16:24.962
That can't be easy.

01:16:26.363 --> 01:16:27.498
No.

01:16:28.632 --> 01:16:31.368
Have you planned out
what you're gonna do?

01:16:32.136 --> 01:16:33.635
Do nothing.

01:16:33.637 --> 01:16:36.338
You know, spend time together.
I don't want to do things.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.240
I've spent me whole life
doing things.

01:16:38.242 --> 01:16:41.346
Now I want to do
absolutely nothing.

01:16:44.347 --> 01:16:47.683
Yeah, when we lost Debbie,
I think Tom felt like that.

01:16:47.685 --> 01:16:50.388
Just gave up work
and...

01:16:51.655 --> 01:16:54.158
stopped, really.
Well...

01:16:55.126 --> 01:16:57.061
I suppose I did too.

01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:01.132
I understand that.

01:17:07.305 --> 01:17:09.507
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:17:12.076 --> 01:17:14.977
I don't think anyone
knows that.

01:17:14.979 --> 01:17:19.016
You try not to think about it,
but it's there all the time.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.456
Maybe...

01:17:25.288 --> 01:17:27.125
you don't do anything.

01:17:28.626 --> 01:17:34.228
Look... I don't know if this is any
good, but I'll say it anyway.

01:17:34.230 --> 01:17:37.199
My daughter, Debbie,
was taken away from us suddenly.

01:17:37.201 --> 01:17:39.034
I can't explain it.

01:17:39.036 --> 01:17:40.538
It's beyond me.

01:17:42.139 --> 01:17:44.376
But if I'd have known
she was going to die...

01:17:45.342 --> 01:17:49.380
all I would've done
was to spend time with her.

01:17:54.185 --> 01:17:56.288
I don't want him
to die.

01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:02.159
I know.

01:18:05.563 --> 01:18:07.132
I know.

01:18:29.686 --> 01:18:32.090
Oh, thank you.

01:18:39.497 --> 01:18:41.633
Here, fix this tie,
will you?

01:18:42.533 --> 01:18:44.500
A grown man can't
fix his own tie.

01:18:44.502 --> 01:18:47.102
What's that about?

01:18:47.104 --> 01:18:48.469
You look well, kid.

01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:51.175
- Thank you.
- Are you not meant to say that back?

01:18:51.775 --> 01:18:53.041
You look well.

01:18:53.043 --> 01:18:54.378
Too late.

01:18:59.115 --> 01:19:01.583
We'll just stay
for the funeral, okay?

01:19:01.585 --> 01:19:03.117
I'm tired.

01:19:03.119 --> 01:19:05.387
Joan, if you don't
want to go...

01:19:05.389 --> 01:19:07.522
Oh, no,
I do want to go.

01:19:07.524 --> 01:19:10.125
But I don't want to get
involved in anything afterwards.

01:19:10.127 --> 01:19:12.294
- Are you in pain?
- Yeah, a bit.

01:19:12.296 --> 01:19:15.397
- Take another tablet.
- Oh, I will later.

01:19:15.399 --> 01:19:18.303
I'm trying to hold off.
I'm taking too many as it is.

01:19:19.436 --> 01:19:22.306
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

01:19:42.525 --> 01:19:46.296
The last few weeks of
Peter and I's time together was...

01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:49.498
was beautiful.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.202
I've never watched so much
rubbish TV in my life.

01:19:55.805 --> 01:19:58.175
It's brilliant,
rubbish TV.

01:20:00.176 --> 01:20:02.380
All we did
was sit together.

01:20:03.346 --> 01:20:05.516
That's all
we needed to do.

01:20:07.784 --> 01:20:11.389
I've never loved any person
as much as I loved that man.

01:20:14.591 --> 01:20:18.562
He made me
face the world and...

01:20:20.663 --> 01:20:23.534
I will miss him more
than he will ever know.

01:20:26.337 --> 01:20:28.306
Peter, I love you.

01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:34.375
I don't know what I'm gonna
do without you, but...

01:20:34.377 --> 01:20:39.416
I do know that you're still
forever the best part of me.

01:20:58.702 --> 01:21:01.903
Hey, that's too many.
Can you not just get a few?

01:21:01.905 --> 01:21:05.307
- No. You need more than a few.
- There's only the two of us.

01:21:05.309 --> 01:21:07.375
You can't just cook a
few Brussels sprouts.

01:21:07.377 --> 01:21:08.943
Why not?

01:21:08.945 --> 01:21:12.647
- Oh, I don't know. You just can't.
- Why do we even have to get any?

01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:14.782
- I don't even eat them.
- I do.

01:21:14.784 --> 01:21:17.451
Once a year.
You eat them once a year.

01:21:17.453 --> 01:21:19.487
Well, that's why it's
important to get them.

01:21:19.489 --> 01:21:20.923
Anyway,
what do you care?

01:21:20.925 --> 01:21:22.657
They stink
the place up.

01:21:22.659 --> 01:21:25.593
- You stink the place up.
- Very good.

01:21:25.595 --> 01:21:28.397
I'm gonna head around
here and get some beer.

01:21:28.399 --> 01:21:31.500
- Have we enough wine?
- Yes, plenty of wine.

01:21:31.502 --> 01:21:34.669
Running out over Christmas
would be a nightmare.

01:21:34.671 --> 01:21:37.406
- Don't get too much beer.
- I'll get what I need.

01:21:37.408 --> 01:21:39.340
I'm just saying
don't get too much.

01:21:39.342 --> 01:21:40.642
Ditto regarding
the sprouts.

01:21:40.644 --> 01:21:42.544
Oh, get some smoked
salmon, will you?

01:21:42.546 --> 01:21:44.679
Oh, aye? Just a wee bit for you?

01:21:44.681 --> 01:21:45.817
Aye.

01:22:01.832 --> 01:22:05.500
Put a wee bit of tinsel round
the goldfish tank too, will you?

01:22:05.502 --> 01:22:07.902
I will if I've got
enough left.

01:22:07.904 --> 01:22:10.742
- The fish needs to know it's Christmas.
- Oh, aye.

01:22:23.921 --> 01:22:26.588
- You want some more wine?
- No, I'm all right.

01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:28.560
Got enough there,
thanks.

01:22:30.694 --> 01:22:33.731
- Know what I was thinking?
- No, Tom. What were you thinking?

01:22:35.966 --> 01:22:39.503
We should invite your man
Steve over for Christmas.

01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:43.705
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

01:22:43.707 --> 01:22:45.877
I do have them
sometimes.

01:22:47.744 --> 01:22:50.278
Not Christmas dinner
though.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.048
I hadn't thought when,
but why not Christmas dinner?

01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:57.052
Well, I'm sure he's got
other places to be anyway.

01:22:57.054 --> 01:22:58.620
He might be on his own.

01:22:58.622 --> 01:23:00.992
He mightn't want to come
out on Christmas Day.

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:04.925
Maybe, but how do you
know that unless you ask him?

01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:09.363
You ask him, then he says, "I can, I can't.
I want to, I don't want to."

01:23:09.365 --> 01:23:12.737
Yeah, but he might feel
under pressure if we ask him.

01:23:13.604 --> 01:23:15.570
Why don't you leave
the decision up to him

01:23:15.572 --> 01:23:17.039
instead of you
making it for him?

01:23:17.041 --> 01:23:20.845
Even though we haven't even
asked him the question yet.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.915
All right,
but just not Christmas Day.

01:23:26.917 --> 01:23:30.018
A drink then.
Invite him round for a drink.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.387
Yeah, that would
be lovely.

01:23:32.389 --> 01:23:34.792
- Okay. You have his number?
- Yeah.

01:23:35.759 --> 01:23:38.829
- Will you phone him or will I?
- You can phone him.

01:23:39.762 --> 01:23:40.864
Right.

01:23:42.498 --> 01:23:43.932
I know what
we've just said,

01:23:43.934 --> 01:23:46.701
and I'm not saying
this will happen, but...

01:23:46.703 --> 01:23:47.804
Tom...

01:23:49.006 --> 01:23:52.441
if you want to ask him for
Christmas, ask him for Christmas.

01:23:52.443 --> 01:23:54.409
Okay. Hey...

01:23:54.411 --> 01:23:55.811
do we have enough
Brussels sprouts?

01:23:55.813 --> 01:23:57.949
More than enough.

01:28:20.946 --> 01:28:25.946
