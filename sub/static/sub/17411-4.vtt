   AND A MAJOR GROWTH SPURT.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.172

      TO BE NEW, ISN'T IT?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.790
         AND IT'S TOUGH
      TO FEEL EXCLUDED...

02:04.792 --> 02:07.359
     NOT THAT I FEEL THAT.

   OPEN THIS UP TO THE CIRCLE

07:34.620 --> 07:37.189
         - OH, MY GOD!
   MARCUS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:37.191 --> 07:40.692
           - OH, MOM.
 I AM IN TROUBLE, BIG TROUBLE.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.994
    WE'RE TALKING A LIFETIME
         OF SHAME HERE.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.096
  - WELL, THE PHONE CALL I GOT
    SAID THAT YOU INSTIGATED

07:45.098 --> 07:47.999
SOME SORT OF SCIENCE EXPLOSION,
    BUT I TOLD THE PRINCIPAL

07:48.001 --> 07:50.202
      I-I COULDN'T BELIEVE
   THAT THAT WAS INTENTIONAL.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.703
   - OH, IT WAS INTENTIONAL.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.605
    A REAL BAD BOY WOULD LIE
       AND SAY IT WASN'T,

07:53.607 --> 07:57.108
       I'M NOT A BAD BOY.
   I'M SINGING LIKE A CANARY.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.243
            [sighs]
           I DID IT.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.045
      - WHY DID YOU DO IT?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.614
      - WILL TOLD ME TO BE
    AN UNATTAINABLE BAD BOY.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.949
           - HE WHAT?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.684
          - I THOUGHT
    IT WOULD GET ME INVITED

08:05.686 --> 08:08.019
  TO HANNAH'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,
  BUT IT WASN'T WORTH IT, MOM.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.256
  NO PARTY IS WORTH TARNISHING
      MY PERMANENT RECORD.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.226
      IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL,
           SO CLEAN.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.928
         - OH, JOANNE,
       I'M SO GLAD THAT--

08:16.930 --> 08:18.230
           - NOT NOW.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.998
       I JUST GOT A CALL
 THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS INVOLVED

08:20.000 --> 08:22.567
        IN AN EXPLOSION
     CAUSED BY SOME MANIAC.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.668
       - CAN WE JUST TALK
          IN PRIVATE?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.937
           - [sighs]
     - I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.239
           - [sighs]

08:27.241 --> 08:28.840
         - MY DAUGHTER
     HAS NEVER BEEN CALLED

08:28.842 --> 08:30.141
  INTO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
            BEFORE.

08:30.143 --> 08:34.279
 - I'M SORRY. I REALIZE I'M NOT
   HOLDING THE TALKING STICK,

08:34.280 --> 08:36.248
   BUT I REALLY JUST WANT TO
 GET MY DAUGHTER AND GO, OKAY?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.649
        - WAIT, JOANNE.
             WAIT.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.118
CAN--CAN I JUST SHARE SOMETHING
           WITH YOU?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.888
      I THINK THAT MY SON
    GOT SOME VERY BAD ADVICE

08:42.890 --> 08:45.724
  FROM AN EMOTIONALLY STUNTED
           MAN-CHILD.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.592
 AND I'VE JUST BEEN PIECING IT
           TOGETHER,

08:47.594 --> 08:49.528
 BUT I THINK ALL MY SON WANTED
         WAS AN INVITE

08:49.530 --> 08:51.263
       TO YOUR DAUGHTER'S
        BIRTHDAY PARTY.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.665
 - [scoffs] WELL, I'M NOT SURE
  SHE'S GONNA WANT HIM THERE,

08:53.667 --> 08:55.634
           ESPECIALLY
   AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.937
           - PLEASE,
   WILL YOU JUST CONSIDER IT?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.706
           AS I SAID,
     VERY MISGUIDED ADVICE,

09:01.708 --> 09:03.675
      VERY MISGUIDED MAN.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.280
        [inhales deeply]

09:08.282 --> 09:09.681
      NOPE, I'M NOT READY.
            HOLD ON.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.682
        [exhales deeply]

09:10.684 --> 09:11.983
            BREATHE.
        [inhales deeply]

09:11.985 --> 09:13.718
      TWO, THREE, EXHALE.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.120
        [exhales deeply]

09:15.122 --> 09:17.322
        I'M BETTER NOW.
          I'M BETTER.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.723
        I AM VERY UPSET!

09:18.725 --> 09:20.926
          DID YOU RUN
     OUT OF INCENSE STICKS?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.727
    - YOU GAVE MY SON ADVICE

09:22.729 --> 09:23.929
       THAT GOT HIM SENT
   TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

09:23.931 --> 09:26.231
       AND ALMOST CAUSED
     A NEAR-FATAL EXPLOSION

09:26.233 --> 09:28.166
      IN HIS SCIENCE LAB.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.669
 THAT IS A SLIGHT EXAGGERATION.
        I'M VERY ANGRY!

09:30.671 --> 09:32.737
      - I DID NOT TELL HIM
  TO BLOW UP HIS SCIENCE LAB.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.873
      - YOU TOLD HIM TO BE
    AN UNATTAINABLE BAD BOY.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.041
          - OH, YEAH,
      I DID TELL HIM THAT.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.175
    - WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.344
- MARCUS NEEDS SOME GAME, OKAY?

09:39.346 --> 09:40.779
       I WAS JUST TRYING
        TO HELP HIM OUT,

09:40.781 --> 09:42.681
        GET HIM NOTICED
     BY THAT GIRL HE LIKES.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.316
          - WHAT GIRL?
      - HANNAH BICKLEMAN.

09:44.318 --> 09:48.119
   - HE DOES NOT LIKE A GIRL.
      HE'S NOT THERE YET.

09:48.121 --> 09:51.323
       - OH, HE'S THERE.
     - NO, HE IS NOT THERE.

09:51.325 --> 09:52.757
   AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

09:52.759 --> 09:54.025
       IF YOU WOULD LEAVE
      THE PARENTING TO ME.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.328
   - OKAY, AND I THINK MARCUS
        WOULD APPRECIATE

09:56.330 --> 09:57.629
   NOT BEING A SOCIAL OUTCAST

09:57.631 --> 09:59.698
       FOR THE FIRST TIME
        IN SIX SCHOOLS!

10:00.900 --> 10:02.300
           - WELL...

10:02.302 --> 10:06.771
         PUT A SHIRT ON
  WHEN YOU WORK ON YOUR HOG.!

10:08.808 --> 10:10.642
         - [whispering]
          WILL. WILL.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.611
             WILL.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.778
    I'VE ONLY GOT A SECOND.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.347
          I'M GROUNDED
    BECAUSE I WAS A BAD BOY.

10:15.349 --> 10:16.815
   BUT LOOK WHAT IT GOT ME--

10:16.817 --> 10:19.184
  AN INVITE TO HANNAH'S PARTY!

10:19.186 --> 10:22.053
           - MARCUS?
          - GOT TO GO.

10:31.197 --> 10:31.630
               .

10:31.632 --> 10:33.999
    I SCORE HER KID A TICKET

10:34.001 --> 10:36.668
    TWEEN CHICK'S BIRTHDAY,
      AND I'M THE VILLAIN.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.070
       FROM LIVING ALONE
     THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

10:39.072 --> 10:42.974
 BECAUSE I HAVE COMPLETELY LOST
      MY MOJO WITH DAKOTA.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.042
          I DON'T KNOW
   WHAT HAPPENED TO MY GAME.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.078
    - BUT YOU SCORED THE KID
    AN INVITE TO THE PARTY.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.047
     I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
 - COULD WE TALK ABOUT ME, MAN?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.882
   I AM FLAILING WITH DAKOTA.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.151
      THAT'S LIKE WHIFFING
         ON A TEE SHOT.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.253
 - I THINK YOU'RE UPSET BECAUSE
   FIONA'S NOT ACKNOWLEDGING

10:55.255 --> 10:57.155
     THE IMPACT YOU'VE HAD
      ON HER CHILD'S LIFE.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.757
    AND I GOT TO SAY, WILL--

10:58.759 --> 11:01.092
   YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY
    BEAUTIFUL IMPACT THERE.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.728
     I THINK I NEED TO TAKE
    ANOTHER SWING AT DAKOTA.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.130
      I JUST GOT TO SQUARE
         MY SHOULDERS,

11:05.132 --> 11:07.932
       KEEP MY HEAD DOWN,
 AND JUST HAVE SEX WITH DAKOTA.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.868
 - THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
   - ALL RIGHT, THANKS, ANDY.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.971
  THAT WAS A GOOD TALK, DUDE.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.340
    - HE DIDN'T HEAR A WORD
            I SAID.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.743
      - WHAT DO YOU THINK
         OF THIS SHIRT?

11:18.745 --> 11:21.079
   I DON'T WANT TO BE STYLISH
   AT THE EXPENSE OF COMFORT.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.782
THERE'LL BE DANCING, AND I NEED
    A FABRIC THAT BREATHES.

11:23.784 --> 11:27.752
 WHO WILL YOU BE DANCING WITH,
    WITH THE BIRTHDAY GIRL?

11:27.754 --> 11:29.120
   - I'D LIKE TO GO SEE WILL.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.189
 THERE'S I MUST DISCUSS BRIEFLY
           WITH HIM.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.024
    - IS IT--IS IT SOMETHING
      I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

11:33.026 --> 11:36.995
  WE'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE A GUY
    LIKE WILL IN OUR LIVES.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.864
            - YEAH.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.067
          WELL, OKAY,
    JUST FOR A FEW MINUTES.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.936
     YOU LOOK VERY DASHING,
            DARLING.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.972
    ANY GIRL WOULD BE LUCKY
       TO DANCE WITH YOU.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.307
           - THANKS.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.213
        [knock at door]

11:55.215 --> 11:57.849
    - DAKOTA, IT'S ME, WILL.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.051
            [knocks]
            DAKOTA?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.053
      LISTEN, I JUST WANT
         TO ASSURE YOU

12:02.055 --> 12:03.388
      THAT THE MOTORCYCLE
          IS WORKING.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.989
 IT'S FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS.

12:04.991 --> 12:09.327
SO ANYTIME YOU'RE READY TO RIDE,
           SO ARE WE.

12:11.497 --> 12:12.964
        LISTEN, DAKOTA,

12:12.966 --> 12:14.866
    I-I KNOW WHY YOU'RE NOT
    OPENING THE DOOR, OKAY?

12:14.868 --> 12:17.035
   I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE UP
       THAT I HAD A SON,

12:17.037 --> 12:20.105
   AND I DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T
    HAVE GIVEN HIM LEUKEMIA.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.240
 BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
           THE TRUTH,

12:22.242 --> 12:25.110
   I-I FEEL LIKE A COMPLETELY
        DIFFERENT PERSON

12:25.112 --> 12:28.480
   LIKE, EVER SINCE THIS KID,
       WHO'S NOT MY SON,

12:28.482 --> 12:30.215
       CAME INTO MY LIFE,
         I'VE CHANGED.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.750
         I FEEL THINGS.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.085
  AND I-I REALLY JUST WANT TO
     FEEL THINGS WITH YOU.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.121
        AND I MEAN THAT
   IN THE LEAST SEXUAL WAY...

12:36.123 --> 12:37.288
           POSSIBLE.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.791
           - GO AWAY,
     OR I'LL CALL THE COPS!

12:39.793 --> 12:42.227
         - YES, MA'AM.
         - RIGHT HERE.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.396
          GET INSIDE.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.831
        - I REALLY MEANT
       WHAT I WAS SAYING.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.266
      - I'M GONNA ROCK...

12:48.268 --> 12:50.502
          YOUR WORLD.
             - OH!

12:50.504 --> 12:52.003
 - WE'VE GOT THREE HOURS, WILL.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.539
     AT SOME LITTLE BITCH'S
        BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.040
         - OH, HANNAH--
   I KNOW THAT LITTLE BITCH.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.109
          I MEAN GIRL.
             - OH!

12:59.478 --> 13:01.980
     THAT PARTY'S GONNA BE
       SUCH A NIGHTMARE.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.282
 SOME CRAZY MOM ACCOSTED JOANNE

13:04.284 --> 13:06.184
     AND CORNERED HER INTO
  PITY-INVITING SOME PALE KID.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.920
    - WAIT, THIS PALE KID--
      DOES HE HAVE A NAME?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.522
           - MM, MM.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.490
    OH, GOD, THE GIRLS HAVE
SOME TERRIBLE NICKNAME FOR HIM.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.858
          WHAT IS IT?
            [gasps]

13:13.860 --> 13:15.026
         OH, WHATEVER!

13:15.028 --> 13:16.995
            JUST GET
  THESE DAMN BOOTS OFF, WILL.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.496
           WILL! TUG!

13:18.498 --> 13:20.098
  - THE KIDS AT THE PARTY ARE
 BASICALLY GOOD PEOPLE, RIGHT?

13:20.100 --> 13:22.033
   - OH, GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT?
  JUST TAKE ME IN THE BEDROOM.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.835
      - OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.
            - RIGHT!

13:23.837 --> 13:25.003
    OH, MY GOD, JUST TAKE ME
        ON THE COUNTER.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.171
            - OKAY.
            - OKAY.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.006
            - WAIT.
         THESE KIDS...

13:28.008 --> 13:29.340
       ARE GONNA MAKE HIM
         FEEL INCLUDED,

13:29.342 --> 13:30.875
          EVEN THOUGH
    IT WAS A PITY INVITE...

13:30.877 --> 13:33.411
        - RIGHT? THE KID
  WITH THE HORRIBLE NICKNAME?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.079
 - IT WAS A HORRIBLE NICKNAME.

13:35.081 --> 13:35.980
            [gasps]
             MUCUS!

13:35.982 --> 13:39.417
    - I JUST REMEMBERED WHAT
 THE GIRLS CALL THE PALE KID--

13:39.419 --> 13:42.053
             MUCUS.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.288
             both:
          OH, MY GOD.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.223
        MARCUS IS MUCUS!

13:45.225 --> 13:47.125
  - WE GOT TO GO TO THE PARTY.
            - WE DO!

13:47.127 --> 13:49.127
         - 15 MINUTES.
           - 45! MM!

13:49.129 --> 13:50.562
    WE HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW,
           DON'T WE?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.964
           - DAMN IT!
           - [yells]

13:52.966 --> 13:55.967
     [dance music playing]

13:55.969 --> 13:57.402
              ¶ ¶

13:57.404 --> 13:59.437
   - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 - WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT MARCUS.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.206
         - OH, I KNOW.
   HE'S BEEN RELYING ON YOU.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.107
    AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
      I'M A SINGLE MOTHER.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.576
       IT'S HARD TO ADMIT
         THAT IT'S GOOD

14:04.578 --> 14:05.977
    TO HAVE A MALE PRESENCE

  - YOU GOT HIM A PITY INVITE.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.516
     - NO, IT WASN'T PITY.
        IT WAS EMPATHY.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.117
      - POTATO, PO-TAH-TO.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.921

         - SMALL TOWN,
        EVIL UNDERBELLY.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.619
         WE HAD TO FLEE
  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

15:21.621 --> 15:23.121
       WHICH WAS A SHAME
   BECAUSE THERE WAS ACTUALLY

15:23.123 --> 15:24.622
    A LOVELY FARMERS MARKET.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.124
     WE'VE GOT TO HELP HIM!

15:26.126 --> 15:27.625
            - OKAY.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.429
     WE COULD START A FIRE,
      CREATE A DIVERSION,

15:31.431 --> 15:33.498
       AND RUSH HIM OUT.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.266
             WHAT?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.002
  - LISTEN, I'LL HANDLE THIS--
       SIMPLE EXTRACTION.

          HEY, BUDDY.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.278
            - WILL?
            - YEAH.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.513
   - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.114
       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
     I WAS SITTING AT HOME,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.516
     AND I HAD A HANKERING
           FOR RIBS,

15:51.518 --> 15:52.984
      AND I WAS WONDERING,

15:52.986 --> 15:55.586
     AND THEN I THOUGHT OF
MY BEST PAL IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

15:55.588 --> 15:59.190
  - I LOVE THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP
    IS SO MEANINGFUL TO YOU.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.426
    BUT I THINK WE BOTH NEED
     TO FOSTER FRIENDSHIPS

16:01.428 --> 16:03.628
    WITH PEOPLE OUR OWN AGE.
          - OH. YEAH.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.999
  BUT, UH--WELL, MAYBE WE CAN
 HAVE A ROOT BEER BEFORE I GO.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.334
          - ROOT BEER?

16:09.336 --> 16:12.036
     SURE. I'M ALWAYS DOWN
     FOR A GOOD ROOT BEER.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.073
       - OH, HEY, HANNAH.
        HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.174
     THAT DRESS IS LOVELY.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.109
        - OH, THANK YOU.
            I KNOW.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.444
           - [laughs]
           OH, GOSH.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.179
        HONEY, YOU HAVE
A LITTLE SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.047
            I THINK
    YOUR EYELINER'S RUNNING.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.215
          - OH, IT IS?
          WAIT. WHERE?

16:24.217 --> 16:26.184
        - OH, NO, HONEY,
      YOU JUST SMUDGED IT.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.052
     HEY, LET'S GO UPSTAIRS
      AND TAKE CARE OF IT.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.420
   LET'S GO TO THE BATHROOM.
          - UH, OKAY.

     SHAKE A TAIL FEATHER!

16:36.095 --> 16:39.364
        - HELLO, HANNAH.
       I'M MARCUS'S MUM.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.199
       - WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:41.201 --> 16:45.236
  - WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU COULD DANCE WITH MY SON.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.106
     I'M JUST TRYING TO FIX
          MY EYELINER.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.208
    - YOUR EYELINER'S FINE.
       JUST STAY WITH US.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.511
  - WHY NOT HAVE HAVE HAN SOLO
  DROP THEM OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE

16:53.513 --> 16:55.747
 AND THEN GO TO THE REBEL BASE
      IN A DIFFERENT SHIP?

16:55.749 --> 16:59.150
    I DON'T KNOW--IT'S JUST
     ALWAYS BUMPED FOR ME.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.219
      - SO, UM, I'M DONE.
       UH, ARE YOU GOOD?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.720
   - UH, WELL, YOU DON'T WANT
       ANOTHER ROOT BEER?

17:02.722 --> 17:06.190
       - MARCUS, MARCUS,
   HOLD ON A SECOND. HOLD ON.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.726
            [sighs]
     HERE'S THE THING, MAN.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.161
      I DON'T THINK HANNAH

17:10.163 --> 17:12.363
    IS SOMEONE THAT YOU WANT
      TO BE FRIENDS WITH.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.066
           - WHY NOT?

17:15.068 --> 17:16.800
             - I...

17:16.803 --> 17:19.637
       I JUST DON'T THINK
  SHE KNOWS HOW GREAT YOU ARE,

17:19.638 --> 17:21.172
        AND I DON'T WANT
      TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.141
   - WILL, YOU'RE A WISE MAN,

17:23.143 --> 17:25.143
      MAYBE THE WISEST MAN
         I'VE EVER MET.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.743
     BUT IN THIS SITUATION,
         YOU'RE WRONG.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.414
     I ASKED HER TO DANCE,
   AND SHE SAID SHE WOULD...

17:29.416 --> 17:31.149
       LATER, MUCH LATER.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.784
     - OH, DUDE, I THINK--

17:32.786 --> 17:35.420
     - THE FIRST SLOW SONG
          THAT PLAYS,

17:35.422 --> 17:37.688
  I'M GONNA DANCE WITH HANNAH.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.459
  - YOU PEOPLE ARE SCARING ME.

17:41.461 --> 17:45.063
       - HANNAH, DARLING,
  YOU ARE A VERY POPULAR GIRL,

17:45.065 --> 17:48.232
          AND AS SUCH,
   YOU WIELD A LOT OF POWER,

17:48.234 --> 17:49.834
  PROBABLY MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

17:49.836 --> 17:53.271
 - AND WHEN YOUR BOOBS COME IN,
           LOOK OUT.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.142
     - OUR LIVES COME DOWN
    TO A SERIES OF CHOICES.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.778
   NOW, YOU CAN EITHER CHOOSE
     TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD

18:00.780 --> 18:02.480
      AND BE THE HEROINE,

18:02.482 --> 18:04.615
       OR YOU CAN CHOOSE
      TO TAKE THE LOW ROAD

18:04.617 --> 18:08.619
 AND BE PART OF AN UGLY SOCIETY
DIVIDED BY LINES OF POPULARITY,

18:08.621 --> 18:10.455
       WHICH IS DREADFUL.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.689
       DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

18:11.691 --> 18:14.225
    - I JUST WANT TO GO BACK
          TO MY PARTY.

           I WAS YOU.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.765
     AND DID I ALWAYS MAKE
       THE BEST CHOICES?

18:20.767 --> 18:25.503
          THE TRUTH IS
  I DESTROYED A LOT OF PEOPLE.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.638
         - WHAT DAKOTA
      IS TRYING TO SAY...

18:27.640 --> 18:30.441
           - IS THAT
    YOU CAN CHOOSE RIGHT NOW

18:30.443 --> 18:32.710
       TO DO A MEAN THING
      OR DO A GOOD THING.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.413
   - AND DANCING WITH MARCUS
       WOULD BE CHOOSING

18:35.415 --> 18:37.849
  TO DO SUCH A WONDERFUL THING
          FOR SOMEONE,

18:37.851 --> 18:40.885
     AND YOU HAVE THE POWER
     TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

      - I'M GONNA SCREAM.
           - [scoffs]
