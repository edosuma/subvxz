00:14.698 --> 00:16.598
Hey.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.065
Why does everything
look different?

00:18.066 --> 00:19.800
And what have you
done with my hair?

00:19.801 --> 00:23.544
I distinctly remember leaving it
right here, all over the place.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.045
I'm cleaning up a little.

00:26.385 --> 00:28.320
Oh, what?

00:28.321 --> 00:30.157
'Cause you've stopped
smoking weed, I can't either?

00:30.158 --> 00:32.226
I'm trying to air
the place out.

00:32.226 --> 00:34.497
(yelling)

00:37.973 --> 00:39.173
(yelling)

00:39.174 --> 00:40.374
(vacuum cleaner dies)

00:40.375 --> 00:42.710
Sorry, Ryan!

00:42.711 --> 00:45.715
Rah! Die! Evil!

00:45.716 --> 00:49.018
Robot! (panting)

00:49.019 --> 00:51.787
It's dead.

00:55.591 --> 00:57.225
Ryan, it's been ten days.

00:57.226 --> 00:58.392
What are you trying to prove?

00:58.393 --> 01:00.394
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

01:00.395 --> 01:02.965
I just like feeling
clear-headed for a change.

01:02.966 --> 01:04.869
Now I've got more time
for things like

01:04.870 --> 01:06.637
catching up on my reading,
and learning yoga.

01:06.638 --> 01:08.006
- Yoga?
- Yeah.

01:08.007 --> 01:09.675
Kristen invited me
to one of her classes.

01:09.676 --> 01:11.477
Kristen?

01:11.478 --> 01:13.346
Exactly how long
is this pointless

01:13.347 --> 01:15.348
lifestyle experiment gonna last?

01:15.349 --> 01:17.884
I've made some positive
changes in my life.

01:17.885 --> 01:19.720
In fact, last night
I polished up

01:19.721 --> 01:21.188
- my résumé.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:21.189 --> 01:22.789
Easy does it.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.392
A job, Ryan?

01:24.393 --> 01:25.794
You really think
you're ready for that?

01:25.795 --> 01:27.596
Up there?

01:27.597 --> 01:29.432
I've never felt better.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.734
Why are you trying to
undermine my confidence?

01:31.735 --> 01:33.636
It's like you're
working against me.

01:33.637 --> 01:35.871
Working against you?

01:35.872 --> 01:37.406
Come on, mate.

01:37.407 --> 01:39.308
Have a little faith.

01:39.309 --> 01:40.342
Don't you think you're
being a bit paranoid?

01:42.412 --> 01:44.647
(Wilfred's voice fades
and echoes in background)

01:44.648 --> 01:46.015
Ryan, I know you've got your doubts.
But you're my best friend.

01:46.016 --> 01:47.984
I love you, mate.

01:47.985 --> 01:48.852
I'd never do anything to...

01:48.853 --> 01:50.455
Ryan.

01:50.456 --> 01:52.623
- Are you listening to me?
- Ah! What?

01:52.624 --> 01:54.659
I said I'd never do
anything to harm you.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.801
Mm.

02:02.802 --> 02:05.672
A whimsical,
light-bodied bouquet.

02:05.673 --> 02:09.342
Crisp, with a hint of peach.

02:09.344 --> 02:10.845
And a lingering,
rotten-egg finish.

02:10.846 --> 02:11.812
Exquisite.

02:11.813 --> 02:13.281
(breathes out)

02:13.282 --> 02:15.550
Boy, I needed this. I have
been so stressed lately.

02:15.551 --> 02:17.052
What's up?

02:17.053 --> 02:19.722
Dr. Ramos invited me to go
to India for four months

02:19.723 --> 02:21.290
to help him open his new clinic.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.892
Congratulations.
That's amazing.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.760
Well, Leo doesn't
want me to go.

02:24.761 --> 02:27.663
He says I won't be able
to adjust to a new culture.

02:27.664 --> 02:29.131
Excuse me, but I was the one

02:29.132 --> 02:30.532
who was willing to live
in the Valley.

02:30.533 --> 02:31.800
(Kristen's voice fades)

02:31.801 --> 02:33.869
Leo thinks I talk too much....

02:33.870 --> 02:36.238
We actually haven't
been talking.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.507
Communicating at all...

02:38.508 --> 02:40.876
Ryan.

02:40.877 --> 02:42.545
Hey. Do you see that guy?

02:44.582 --> 02:46.683
Who are you talking about?

02:46.684 --> 02:48.986
Never mind.

02:48.987 --> 02:51.322
Oh, Ryan, you have
to experience this.

02:51.323 --> 02:55.794
Leathery, with subtle
tones of menstruation.

02:55.795 --> 02:57.162
When this s opens up,
it's gonna be beautiful.

02:58.865 --> 03:00.465
I wasn't going to tell you,

03:00.466 --> 03:02.134
because you've been acting
so negative lately, but

03:02.135 --> 03:03.602
I'm going on a date
tomorrow night.

03:03.603 --> 03:05.170
A date? With who?

03:05.171 --> 03:07.573
No one. Just...
someone I met.

03:07.574 --> 03:08.640
Met where?

03:08.641 --> 03:10.409
Well, I...

03:13.713 --> 03:15.247
No.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.317
LoveMatchDating.com?

03:19.318 --> 03:21.520
Oh, my God.

03:21.521 --> 03:23.222
Please tell me that donkey-faced
thing with the braces

03:23.223 --> 03:24.590
is not the chick
you're going out with.

03:24.591 --> 03:26.292
She doesn't have braces.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.860
Yeah, you just can't see them,

03:27.861 --> 03:29.629
'cause they're probably
on her legs.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.064
How do you think she supports
that massive donkey face?

03:31.065 --> 03:32.799
I think she's a great
match for me.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.668
She's a partner
at a marketing firm,

03:34.669 --> 03:36.237
she enjoys fitness,

03:36.238 --> 03:37.972
and she's looking for a
long-term relationship.

03:37.973 --> 03:39.707
It's way too soon for that.

03:39.708 --> 03:41.676
Let me find you a nice
hit-it-and-quit-it chick.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.047
Gross.

03:46.048 --> 03:48.551
(sighs)
Out of your league.

03:48.552 --> 03:50.686
Lazy eye.

03:50.687 --> 03:52.956
Balding Asian grandmother.

03:52.957 --> 03:54.924
Gross!

03:54.925 --> 03:55.992
Ooh. Here we go.

03:55.993 --> 03:57.494
Angelique.

03:57.495 --> 03:58.895
Are you kidding?

03:58.896 --> 03:59.796
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

03:59.797 --> 04:02.433
"Favorite music: all types."

04:02.434 --> 04:04.468
This chick must be, like,
an expert in music.

04:05.471 --> 04:07.438
Ryan, wait.
Look.

04:07.439 --> 04:09.073
I get it.

04:09.074 --> 04:11.075
You're feeling better
about things.

04:11.076 --> 04:14.313
You're cleaning and yogaing
and not smoking,

04:14.314 --> 04:16.982
and life seems like one
big, fluffy, pink cloud.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.149
Yeah? So?

04:18.151 --> 04:19.885
It's not real.

04:19.886 --> 04:22.354
You think your demons
have vanished, but...

04:22.355 --> 04:24.255
that's a lie, mate.

04:24.256 --> 04:27.358
No offense, but I think I know
myself better than you do.

04:27.359 --> 04:28.059
You're right.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.961
What do I know?

04:29.962 --> 04:31.796
I'm just your neighbor's dog
who talks to you

04:31.797 --> 04:33.197
and doubles partner
in Wii tennis.

04:33.198 --> 04:34.965
You're totally fine.

04:34.966 --> 04:36.766
Mm.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.368
Everything looks so good.

04:38.369 --> 04:41.872
I can't decide.

04:44.209 --> 04:45.709
Ooh!

04:45.710 --> 04:47.478
Red velvet.

04:47.479 --> 04:49.414
I think I'm going to be
a little bit naughty today.

04:49.415 --> 04:50.448
(chuckles)

04:50.449 --> 04:52.850
MAN:
Nice dog.

04:52.851 --> 04:55.220
He's got quite a personality.

04:55.221 --> 04:57.523
Yeah, that's Wilfred all right.

04:57.524 --> 04:59.258
(scoffs)
Wilfred?

04:59.259 --> 05:00.592
Is that what he's
calling himself now?

05:02.395 --> 05:04.629
You know, that's real
Italian leather.

05:04.630 --> 05:07.198
He might want to
get a sharper knife.

05:07.199 --> 05:08.265
What...?

05:08.266 --> 05:11.002
Yeah.

05:11.003 --> 05:13.405
I see him, too.

05:13.406 --> 05:15.207
And I hear him.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.409
I hear the things he says.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.578
- Okay, if this is some kind
of twisted joke... - No.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.880
Wilfred ruined my life.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.448
And you know what?

05:23.449 --> 05:26.051
You're next.

05:31.576 --> 05:32.810
I, I don't know why you've
been following me around...

05:32.811 --> 05:35.179
I'm Bruce.
Ryan, is it?

05:35.180 --> 05:37.448
Don't you bullshit me,
Ryan, you see him.

05:37.449 --> 05:39.383
We both know what
I'm talking about.

05:39.384 --> 05:41.285
<i>- Who are you?
- WILFRED: Ryan? Ryan!</i>

05:41.286 --> 05:42.987
Shit, he's coming.

05:42.988 --> 05:46.591
Do not tell Wilfred we talked.

05:46.592 --> 05:49.360
You-you call me when you're
ready to learn the truth.

05:49.361 --> 05:51.062
There you are.

05:51.063 --> 05:52.497
Find anything interesting here?

05:52.498 --> 05:54.332
Oh, no. Not really.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.535
RYAN:
Wilfred.

05:56.536 --> 05:59.371
This... thing we have.

05:59.372 --> 06:02.375
The way we... communicate.

06:02.376 --> 06:07.547
Have you ever had this sort of
relationship with anyone else?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.387
Why do you ask?

06:15.388 --> 06:16.721
Have you?

06:16.722 --> 06:19.224
It happened once before.

06:19.225 --> 06:21.092
I was at a party,

06:21.093 --> 06:25.196
and... this guy looked
right at me and said,

06:25.197 --> 06:27.431
"Hey. What's up, dog?

06:27.432 --> 06:30.935
I see you, and I know
what you're up to."

06:30.936 --> 06:34.439
I said, "Well, I see you, too.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.175
If you've got something
to say, say it."

06:37.944 --> 06:41.547
Turns out he was talking
to the guy right behind me,

06:41.548 --> 06:42.814
who'd been banging his wife.

06:42.815 --> 06:44.549
Wait... Ryan,

06:44.550 --> 06:46.384
please tell me there
hasn't been been a guy

06:46.385 --> 06:48.554
standing behind me
since we met.

06:48.555 --> 06:50.422
(sighs)

06:50.423 --> 06:51.590
(laughs)

06:51.591 --> 06:53.325
So...

06:53.326 --> 06:54.927
nobody else?

06:54.928 --> 06:58.597
You're one of a kind, Ryan.

07:09.475 --> 07:11.876
(upbeat pop intro plays)

07:11.877 --> 07:14.946
(singing in native language)

07:14.947 --> 07:17.682
I had just gotten
promoted to night manager.

07:17.683 --> 07:20.718
So I decided to treat myself
to a sweet-ass studio apartment.

07:20.719 --> 07:22.788
Mini fridge, black
light, you name it.

07:22.789 --> 07:26.225
And one day, I stopped by my
landlady's to drop off the rent,

07:26.226 --> 07:28.093
and this guy answers the door.

07:28.094 --> 07:31.063
Now I can only assume, must
be her mentally unstable son.

07:31.064 --> 07:33.265
It looks like he's playing
dress-up or something.

07:33.266 --> 07:34.666
But what I didn't know was that

07:34.667 --> 07:36.034
other people didn't
see what I saw.

07:36.035 --> 07:37.369
Does this sound familiar?

07:37.370 --> 07:38.637
Yeah. I just never thought

07:38.638 --> 07:40.405
I'd hear this from someone else.

07:40.406 --> 07:41.840
Anyway, we smoke a joint.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.842
Tells me a couple
funny stories.

07:43.843 --> 07:46.478
Next thing I know, I'm hanging
out with him all the time.

07:46.479 --> 07:47.712
I'm his Goddamn best friend.

07:47.713 --> 07:49.514
Let me guess.

07:49.515 --> 07:51.950
He talked you out of
getting a job, didn't he?

07:51.951 --> 07:54.453
Keeps you smoking
weed all the time.

07:54.454 --> 07:55.788
Hell, I bet he even
got you to take a piss

07:55.789 --> 07:57.189
in some poor guy's hat.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.025
Not exactly.

07:59.026 --> 08:01.628
And then he convinced you to
make out with your own father.

08:01.629 --> 08:03.997
- What?! No!
- Yeah.

08:03.998 --> 08:06.133
No. I mean...
me, neither.

08:06.134 --> 08:10.304
Look, I know Wilfred may not
be the best influence,

08:10.305 --> 08:12.006
but he's-he's my friend.

08:12.007 --> 08:13.974
Yeah, I thought so, too.

08:13.975 --> 08:15.608
One night we're at
this strip club.

08:15.609 --> 08:16.943
Wilfred slips me a condom.

08:16.944 --> 08:19.045
Shoves me in the V.I.P. room.

08:19.046 --> 08:21.981
Turns out, he poked a hole
in the tip of that condom.

08:21.982 --> 08:24.783
Next thing I know,
I'm the proud father

08:24.784 --> 08:26.918
of Cinnamon Sizzle's
first-born twins.

08:26.919 --> 08:28.753
- Jesus!
- But the whole time,

08:28.754 --> 08:30.622
through all the
boozing, debauchery,

08:30.623 --> 08:32.256
and making out with...

08:32.258 --> 08:34.125
well, people I won't
normally made out with,

08:34.126 --> 08:38.798
I never doubted that Wilfred
was looking out for me.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.433
I can tell you
don't believe me.

08:41.434 --> 08:43.636
But just ask yourself this.

08:45.673 --> 08:47.374
How well do you really
know Wilfred?

08:50.312 --> 08:52.814
Uh, I'll be back from the
dentist in a couple hours,

08:52.815 --> 08:55.350
so just hang out
on the coach, and--

08:55.351 --> 08:58.553
I don't know-- do whatever it is
you do when I'm not around.

08:58.554 --> 09:00.522
Later, man.

09:00.523 --> 09:03.158
I'm sure I'll be right here
on the coach where you left me.

I, uh...

11:02.082 --> 11:03.549
What, you don't trust me?

11:03.550 --> 11:04.617
What's going on?

11:06.319 --> 11:08.287
I don't know what
to think anymore.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.191
Ryan?

11:13.660 --> 11:16.328
Um... yeah?

11:16.329 --> 11:18.631
(singsongy):
It's me...

11:18.632 --> 11:21.100
Angelique...

11:21.101 --> 11:23.035
Oh.

11:23.036 --> 11:24.336
Hi.

11:24.337 --> 11:27.906
Hey, just to warn you, I had

11:27.907 --> 11:29.708
a gin and Sprite...

11:29.709 --> 11:32.744
while I was getting ready.

11:32.745 --> 11:34.046
Okay, two.

11:34.047 --> 11:35.714
(laughing)

11:35.715 --> 11:38.083
(continues laughing)

11:38.084 --> 11:39.550
Oh, where's your fedora?

11:39.551 --> 11:41.953
You said in your message
you were gonna wear it.

11:41.954 --> 11:43.387
My message

11:43.388 --> 11:44.722
Oh, my God.

11:44.723 --> 11:48.125
Some of the things
that you wrote

11:48.126 --> 11:50.227
were so gross...

11:50.228 --> 11:52.929
I almost didn't come here
on this date.

11:52.930 --> 11:55.098
But then I was, like...

11:55.099 --> 11:57.634
gross is kind of hot, right?

11:57.635 --> 12:00.637
And all of that stuff

12:00.638 --> 12:02.606
about the post office...

12:02.607 --> 12:05.075
I don't really know...

12:05.076 --> 12:07.911
what "snout rape" means...

12:09.480 --> 12:12.382
...but I hate my mailman, too.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.151
(phone ringing)

12:14.152 --> 12:16.954
- WILFRED (over phone): 23 inches, Ryan.
- What?

12:16.955 --> 12:19.056
I know, right?

12:19.057 --> 12:20.824
Why the hell am I on
a date with Angelique

12:20.825 --> 12:22.393
<i>and not the girl I picked?</i>

12:22.394 --> 12:24.795
Angelique is an
alcoholic blow-job machine.

12:24.796 --> 12:25.763
And you're welcome.

12:30.034 --> 12:32.602
L-listen, I think I'm
just gonna head home

12:32.603 --> 12:34.271
and call it a night.

12:34.272 --> 12:37.107
Why don't I just pay
for my drink and...

12:38.275 --> 12:40.677
Oh, I get it.

12:40.678 --> 12:43.146
Let's head home?

12:43.147 --> 12:45.182
Call it a night?

12:45.183 --> 12:46.616
I'm down with that.

12:48.052 --> 12:49.786
- Will you excuse me?
- Yeah.

12:58.829 --> 13:00.429
Shitty date, huh?

13:00.430 --> 13:03.600
What are you doing here?

13:03.601 --> 13:05.935
Do you believe me now, Ryan?

13:05.936 --> 13:10.306
I don't know who
to believe anymore.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.809
Then test that condom.

13:20.816 --> 13:23.484
It's not too late
for you, Ryan.

13:23.485 --> 13:26.587
Get rid of Wilfred.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.689
Get your life back.

13:28.690 --> 13:30.991
Get rid of him?

13:30.992 --> 13:33.127
You mean kill him.

13:33.128 --> 13:34.796
What's wrong with you?

13:34.797 --> 13:36.832
Oh, you don't kill him!

13:36.833 --> 13:39.234
You take him out in the middle
of nowhere and ditch him!

13:39.235 --> 13:42.905
- But he's not even my dog. I...
- Shh!

13:42.906 --> 13:44.874
He's not your dog...

13:44.875 --> 13:47.110
but he's your problem.

13:47.111 --> 13:49.645
All right.

13:49.646 --> 13:52.014
I'll do it.

13:52.015 --> 13:53.449
Hey.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.584
Uh, give me just a second.

13:57.387 --> 13:59.354
(flushes toilet)

13:59.355 --> 14:00.989
Did you just...

14:00.990 --> 14:03.391
Shh...!

14:03.392 --> 14:06.661
Let me just wash my hands.

14:06.662 --> 14:08.362
(turns on faucet)

14:12.666 --> 14:14.635
Wait, so, where we're
going there's an acre,

14:14.636 --> 14:17.238
a full acre of just pot plants,
all for the taking?

14:17.239 --> 14:18.839
And there's no security?

14:18.840 --> 14:20.775
That's what the guy
at the dispensary said.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.544
So, would I be able to, like,

14:22.545 --> 14:24.712
stuff this whole
knapsack full of weed?

14:24.713 --> 14:26.347
(engine starts)
Sure.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.884
Never smelled that before.

14:29.885 --> 14:31.085
Never smelled that before.

14:32.388 --> 14:34.589
Never smelled...
that before.

14:34.590 --> 14:36.657
- Oh... shoot!
- Never smelled that before.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.759
I-I just realized,
I left the granola bars

14:38.760 --> 14:40.761
back in the car.
(exhales)

14:40.762 --> 14:43.497
- I'm sorry, I'll just go get them.
- I'll come with you.

14:43.498 --> 14:45.165
No, th-that's okay.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.401
Uh, just go ahead;
I'll catch up.

14:47.402 --> 14:48.769
You stay here--
I'll go back to the car.

14:48.770 --> 14:50.337
No, no, no, no. No, no.

14:50.338 --> 14:52.774
Just... stay, Wilfred.

14:52.775 --> 14:54.175
Stay.

14:54.176 --> 14:55.944
Is something going on, mate?

14:55.945 --> 14:59.047
You're acting kind of...

14:59.048 --> 15:00.882
Wait, are you...

15:00.883 --> 15:03.451
leaving me here?

15:03.452 --> 15:05.053
(twig snaps)

15:05.054 --> 15:08.189
- What was that?
- What was what?

15:09.658 --> 15:12.026
Bruce.
What are you doing here?

15:12.027 --> 15:13.861
Who are you talking to, mate?

15:13.862 --> 15:15.730
Bruce. You don't see him?

15:15.731 --> 15:17.165
See who?

15:17.166 --> 15:18.866
I knew he'd do this.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.569
He sees me--
he's just being a dick.

15:21.570 --> 15:23.904
Ryan, there's just you and me
here, you know that, right?

15:23.905 --> 15:25.573
You're really starting
to worry me now.

15:25.574 --> 15:27.208
Look, let's just go
back to the car...

15:27.209 --> 15:29.410
(sneezes)
Oh, dude,

15:29.411 --> 15:31.680
you are bloody kidding me!

15:31.681 --> 15:32.781
See?

15:32.782 --> 15:34.016
He knows I'm here.

15:35.585 --> 15:37.719
(panting)

15:37.720 --> 15:39.488
Hello, Bruce.

15:39.489 --> 15:42.190
I should've known you'd
have a hand in this.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.326
And you, Ryan--

15:44.327 --> 15:46.529
conspiring with this lunatic
behind my back.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.665
Okay, it's true. I met Bruce

15:48.666 --> 15:51.033
- a couple days ago, and...
- He told you

15:51.034 --> 15:54.304
- some crazy story about me
ruining his life? - Ryan, don't listen

15:54.305 --> 15:56.506
to him-- he's just trying
to get inside your head.

15:56.507 --> 15:57.908
Who you gonna believe, Ryan?

15:57.909 --> 15:58.909
WILFRED:
Whoa, whoa.

15:58.910 --> 16:00.110
What?

16:00.111 --> 16:01.978
We can't leave him here, Ryan.

16:01.979 --> 16:03.746
Now, I don't know what you are.

16:03.747 --> 16:06.082
I don't know if you're
a devil, an alien,

16:06.083 --> 16:07.817
or something crazier than that,

16:07.818 --> 16:09.619
but someone's got to stop you.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.287
You're not well, mate.

16:11.288 --> 16:12.788
Now, listen to me...

16:12.789 --> 16:14.123
I'm through listening to you!

16:14.124 --> 16:15.824
Violence is never the answer.

16:15.825 --> 16:18.693
As the great Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. once said...

16:18.694 --> 16:19.594
(grunts)

16:22.764 --> 16:25.300
- Ryan! Give me the gun!
- Don't do it, Ryan!

16:25.301 --> 16:26.434
He's gonna ruin your life
like he ruined mine!

16:26.435 --> 16:27.903
- Give me that gun!
- Bullshit!

16:27.904 --> 16:30.006
Did you tell Ryan about
your cocaine addiction?

16:30.007 --> 16:31.908
Or your weakness
for prostitutes?

16:31.909 --> 16:33.577
You convinced me to make out
with my own father.

16:33.578 --> 16:35.045
Everyone at the party loved it!

16:35.046 --> 16:36.213
They thought it was edgy!

16:36.214 --> 16:37.915
(Bruce yells)

16:37.916 --> 16:39.417
(grunting, panting)

16:40.886 --> 16:42.553
Stop!

16:42.554 --> 16:43.821
(gunshot)

16:43.822 --> 16:45.255
Not up there, you idiot!

16:45.256 --> 16:47.258
He's down here!

16:47.259 --> 16:48.993
I don't want to do this.

16:48.994 --> 16:51.162
WILFRED (distorted):
Kill him, Ryan! Kill him...!

16:51.163 --> 16:52.330
(gunshot)

16:53.765 --> 16:54.899
(panting)

16:54.900 --> 16:57.234
Well done, Ryan.

16:57.235 --> 16:58.835
Well done.

16:58.836 --> 17:01.338
Look what you made me do?

17:01.339 --> 17:03.273
<i>Oh, no, this was your choice.</i>

17:03.274 --> 17:05.074
What are you talking about?

17:05.075 --> 17:06.643
I just killed a man!

17:06.644 --> 17:07.743
Or did you?

17:07.744 --> 17:09.079
(gunshot)
(gasps, pants)

17:09.079 --> 17:11.281
Oh! (laughs)

17:11.282 --> 17:12.751
Blanks?

17:12.752 --> 17:14.853
What the hell is going on?

17:14.854 --> 17:15.921
Isn't it obvious?

17:15.922 --> 17:17.256
No, it's not obvious!

17:17.257 --> 17:19.090
Nothing is ever
obvious with you!

17:19.092 --> 17:19.925
May I?

17:20.994 --> 17:22.628
Hi, Ryan.

17:23.329 --> 17:24.063
Hi, Bruce.

17:24.064 --> 17:25.198
Here's the thing, pal.

17:25.199 --> 17:28.435
This shit is complicated.

17:31.272 --> 17:32.339
Good game, Bruce.

17:34.074 --> 17:35.842
I'll get you next time.

17:35.843 --> 17:37.710
Yeah, we'll see about that.

17:37.711 --> 17:40.246
See you around, kid.

17:40.247 --> 17:42.482
"Good game"?

17:42.483 --> 17:45.318
Well, it was more of
a contest, really.

17:45.319 --> 17:46.787
And... I won.

17:46.788 --> 17:49.791
But the real winner... is you.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.959
- And me, of course.
- That doesn't

17:51.960 --> 17:54.695
- really clear things up for me, Wilfred.
- Look, mate, remember

17:54.696 --> 17:57.932
the other day when I told you that
your problems hadn't simply vanished?

17:57.933 --> 18:01.001
I warned you something like this
would happen, but you doubted me.

18:01.002 --> 18:03.604
<i>So you made something
like this happen?</i>

18:03.605 --> 18:06.240
The fact is, you
had your doubts,

18:06.241 --> 18:08.342
so I put you to the test,

18:08.343 --> 18:10.111
and when the chips were down,

18:10.112 --> 18:12.480
you chose faith over doubt.

18:12.481 --> 18:14.415
You chose me.

18:14.416 --> 18:17.284
So... who-who
the hell was that guy?

18:17.285 --> 18:18.519
What guy?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.654
Bruce! The guy
who was just here!

18:20.655 --> 18:22.623
I don't know who you're
talking about, mate.

18:22.624 --> 18:24.691
B... but he was...

18:24.692 --> 18:26.160
but you...

18:26.161 --> 18:27.661
Oh, oh, Bruce?

18:27.662 --> 18:29.596
The guy who was just
here, Bruce Bruce--

18:29.597 --> 18:31.799
oh, yeah, he's gone-- for now.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.301
But listen, if you
see him around again,

18:34.302 --> 18:37.638
you need to let me know, okay?

18:37.639 --> 18:39.840
♪ ♪

18:43.178 --> 18:46.648
I guess you were right.

18:46.649 --> 18:50.752
I still have a long road
ahead of me.

18:50.753 --> 18:54.522
And all those positive changes
I thought I made...

18:54.523 --> 18:56.725
were just fluffy pink clouds.

18:56.726 --> 18:58.060
Yeah.

18:58.061 --> 19:01.364
But those clouds have
a silver lining--

19:01.365 --> 19:02.699
me.

19:04.635 --> 19:07.537
You don't have to
go it alone, Ryan.

19:07.538 --> 19:10.507
Thanks.

19:10.508 --> 19:12.242
(match strikes)
You know...

19:12.243 --> 19:14.777
I really think
I'm gonna be all right.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.247
'Course you are.

19:22.253 --> 19:24.822
I ain't going anywhere.

19:40.623 --> 19:43.225
All right, all right.
Fair enough.

19:43.226 --> 19:45.560
I'll tell you how I met Bruce.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.729
It was about five years ago.

19:47.730 --> 19:50.131
I was hanging around this
college campus.

19:50.132 --> 19:52.400
Bruce was a professor there.

19:52.401 --> 19:55.036
And one day, he wrote this

19:55.037 --> 19:57.906
super-complicated
math equation on the board

19:57.907 --> 20:01.109
that no one could solve,
except me-- the janitor.

20:01.110 --> 20:04.512
<i>Matt Damon?
Good Will Hunting?</i>

20:06.148 --> 20:08.282
Okay.

20:08.283 --> 20:11.351
It's only fair you know
the truth about Bruce.

20:11.352 --> 20:13.220
(sighs)

20:13.221 --> 20:16.656
But I haven't told
this to anyone.

20:16.657 --> 20:19.893
I was a young pup at the time.

20:19.894 --> 20:23.996
Good-looking, but a little
messed-up in the head.

20:23.997 --> 20:26.298
I met Bruce while I was
infiltrating

20:26.299 --> 20:29.068
the Boston Police Department
for this Irish mobster...

20:29.069 --> 20:31.237
<i>The Departed?</i>

20:37.677 --> 20:40.112
You want to know
how I met Bruce?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.749
The truth is...

20:42.750 --> 20:45.952
I don't remember.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.088
All right, well, at least
that's an honest answer.

20:48.089 --> 20:50.424
There's a lot of
things I don't remember:

20:50.425 --> 20:54.862
where I'm from, how I got here.

20:54.863 --> 20:58.199
There's only one
thing I do know.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.470
My name is Jason Bourne.

21:01.471 --> 21:05.841
(blowing into bottle)
