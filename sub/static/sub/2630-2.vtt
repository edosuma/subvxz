00:07.465 --> 00:08.966
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.595
You look cute in bubbles.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.472
Ahh, you're just all liquored up.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.437
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.946
I've had a very long, hard day.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.073
Want some chicken?

00:33.283 --> 00:35.325
No, thanks. No chicken. Bye-bye.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.705
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

00:39.956 --> 00:42.291
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!

00:42.500 --> 00:43.876
All right.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.923
Are you okay? He wouldn't leave.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.634
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.094
Chicken?

00:55.346 --> 00:57.014
I could eat some chicken.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.975
Hey, Joe!

01:02.687 --> 01:06.398
Could I get a, uh, three-piece,
some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

01:06.566 --> 01:08.942
Aah! Diet Coke.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.361
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.239
- Morning, Pheebs.
- I have to tell you this story.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.741
I was coming over
and this cabdriver...

01:57.951 --> 01:59.034
Was his name Angus?

02:00.703 --> 02:01.745
What?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.206
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.999
Oh. Ha, ha, ha.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.876
All right. Anyway...

02:08.127 --> 02:10.378
What was that pub he took us to?

02:10.630 --> 02:11.797
The Wheat Sheaf!

02:12.048 --> 02:13.590
And they had that beer...

02:13.842 --> 02:16.969
- Boddington's.
- Boddington's.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.806
Ooh, uh,
Pheebs was going to tell a story.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.725
So he had a really funny hat.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.270
I don't want to talk about it.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.857
- Hey.
- Hey, Ross!

02:30.233 --> 02:32.025
Boddington's!

02:32.277 --> 02:33.735
Oh, man!

02:34.988 --> 02:39.199
I'd walk back to London for another
frosty one of those bad boys.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.494
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.163
Later!

02:45.248 --> 02:46.748
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.500
Her plane got delayed.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.544
But she should be here by now.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.505
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.674
No. But she likes me.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.760
You abandoned her
on a plane to Greece.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.889
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.016
Emily showed up at the airport.

03:04.225 --> 03:07.311
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.022
She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.440
Emily!

03:13.318 --> 03:16.028
Emily is my wife.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.572
Man, what is that?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.491
You haven't heard from Emily?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.785
Not since I lost her at the airport.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.038
I can't believe she can outrun you.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.749
Hey! She's fast, okay?

03:29.334 --> 03:32.961
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!

03:35.423 --> 03:36.465
Hi!

03:37.008 --> 03:38.175
Hi! Rachel!

03:39.385 --> 03:43.972
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.767
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.102
Hi, Pheebs.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.648
That's it? You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.942
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

03:56.069 --> 03:59.863
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,
met the nice people.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.324
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.037
So, what, that's it?

04:07.664 --> 04:11.333
Well, yeah. We're cool. Totally cool.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.835
Thanks, Rach. You're the best.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.380
Oh, no. You're the best.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.466
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.054
No one will tell me where Emily is...

04:24.264 --> 04:28.392
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.561
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.397
That should get her talking.

04:33.648 --> 04:37.985
When you make out the card,
be sure to make it out to "Emily."

04:42.615 --> 04:45.409
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.786
What?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.707
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.668
Ross abandoned me!

04:54.877 --> 04:59.089
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!

04:59.340 --> 05:04.261
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

05:04.721 --> 05:07.973
I mean, it was so humiliating!

05:08.182 --> 05:10.309
I felt like such an idiot!

05:10.518 --> 05:12.811
It's all my fault. You know why?

05:13.062 --> 05:16.440
Because I make very bad decisions.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.858
Oh, that's not true.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.570
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!

05:21.821 --> 05:24.614
London is stupid! Stupid!

05:26.159 --> 05:28.076
I should've never gone to London.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.997
From now on, you make
all my decisions for me.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.750
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.920
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.547
I'll do it.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.552
Fine. Monica, you are now
in charge of my love life.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.513
Okay. I got to go to work.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.193
And, uh, Rachel, great to have you back.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.324
Pheebs!

06:13.456 --> 06:14.831
Always a pleasure.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.842
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.512
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.013
He's married.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.100
Ross is married. I still can't believe it.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.061
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.438
I'll just have to accept it.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.273
I mean, it's my fault.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.943
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

06:43.152 --> 06:45.112
Oh, my God!

06:49.867 --> 06:53.203
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.163
I know that wasn't about me.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.499
I bet it was about her a little.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.252
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

07:00.461 --> 07:03.338
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.673
Look. Gunther.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.177
He's nice. He's cute.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.721
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...

07:12.140 --> 07:13.974
What about that guy over there?

07:15.226 --> 07:18.019
That's the guy
you flirted with at the counter.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.314
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.649
You're going to talk to him.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.445
I make your decisions,
and I say you're going to talk to him.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.572
All right.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.950
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.411
Say that to him, and you're golden.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.125
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.378
Hey, Pheebs.
We got our pictures back from London.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.298
Here's all of us
at the Tower of London...

07:46.799 --> 07:48.383
Here we all are.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.386
There's Ross and Joey and you and...

07:52.930 --> 07:53.972
And me.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.059
We've been talking about
London too much.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.354
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.

08:01.606 --> 08:05.066
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.776
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.906
- What happened?
- A little of this, a little of that.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.824
I got myself a date tomorrow.

08:13.075 --> 08:17.078
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.706
Get out.

08:35.722 --> 08:36.765
What took so long?

08:37.015 --> 08:40.309
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.567
So thanks for having me over.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.279
Rach...

08:56.369 --> 08:57.577
Pheebs...

09:05.628 --> 09:07.087
See you, man.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.883
What the hell was that?

09:12.426 --> 09:16.721
Probably some European
goodbye thing he picked up in London.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.557
That's not European.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.976
It felt French.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.983
I really had a good time.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.609
Yeah, me too.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.904
- So...
- So...

09:33.155 --> 09:34.239
I guess this is it.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.032
Yeah, um...

09:36.826 --> 09:39.828
- Unless you want to come inside?
- Yeah!

09:40.371 --> 09:45.250
Oh, uh, wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.588
Okay. Just hold on a second.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.634
Um, hi.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.094
Hi.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.638
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.265
Doing her laundry.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.100
What's that?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.978
It came in the mail today.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.732
It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.860
One for each day
I've known and loved Emily...

10:12.069 --> 10:14.237
...cut up into mulch.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.991
Honey, that's awful.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.118
It's not so bad.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.704
Monica's going to make potpourri.

10:25.875 --> 10:30.211
I think I'm going to go
wander out in the rain for a while.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.463
It's not raining.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.215
I can't catch a break.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.887
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.223
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.558
All right?

10:44.560 --> 10:45.769
Okay.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.563
- Hey, Dave.
- Yeah.

10:48.731 --> 10:53.401
Um, I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.653
Okay. Bye.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.866
Honey, listen.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.745
I know things seem so bad...

11:03.954 --> 11:06.289
...and that they won't get any...

11:06.791 --> 11:08.375
Could I talk to you?

11:09.794 --> 11:11.378
I dropped some socks.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.672
Yeah.

11:21.055 --> 11:25.767
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?

11:25.976 --> 11:28.812
You did not drop any socks!

11:29.105 --> 11:31.189
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!

11:31.357 --> 11:32.482
You listen to me!

11:32.692 --> 11:36.569
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

11:36.821 --> 11:37.946
What are you doing?

11:38.155 --> 11:42.158
Well, ultimately I was trying,
you know, I wanted...

11:42.993 --> 11:45.620
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.998
What? You cannot tell him that!

11:49.208 --> 11:50.583
Why? Why not?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.877
People love to hear that!

11:54.422 --> 11:56.589
I make the decisions and I say no!

11:56.799 --> 12:00.427
You know what? No, you don't
make my decisions, because...

12:00.678 --> 12:02.095
...you're fired.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.097
You can't fire me.

12:04.348 --> 12:08.852
I make your decisions,
and I say I'm not fired. Ha!

12:11.105 --> 12:12.272
Well...

12:21.824 --> 12:23.992
Rachel! Come on, let me in!

12:24.243 --> 12:25.744
Having some trouble?

12:26.954 --> 12:28.288
Rachel locked the door.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.499
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.715
Rachel! Let me in!

12:46.891 --> 12:47.974
Thank you.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.521
Rachel? Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

12:54.064 --> 12:55.148
No.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.942
We really need to talk.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.652
Well, then talk.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.946
Okay, I will.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.702
Remember that thing we just discussed
that you wanted to do?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.120
Yes.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.497
What thing?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.753
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.923
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.259
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.513
And who knows who she might
end up hurting?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.231
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.609
I have to use the phone.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.780
I got to cancel those five, giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.491
My God. Think of the massacre.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.785
I'm going to do it.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.829
I know you think I'm crazy.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.165
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...

13:54.375 --> 13:56.709
...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.002
Please?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.548
All right. Fine.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.929
Joey! I'm in!

14:08.222 --> 14:10.306
All right. Good deal.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.898
Pheebs! Hey!

14:19.817 --> 14:23.361
- Uh, Pheebs?
- Yeah?

14:23.529 --> 14:27.824
Um, you know how you were saying
you didn't get to go to London...

14:28.075 --> 14:29.868
...and you were feeling left out?
- Yeah.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.954
Well, we all felt really bad
about that...

14:33.205 --> 14:36.624
...so we decided to
take a little trip together.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.002
Oh, that's so nice!

14:39.253 --> 14:41.045
How great! Where's the trip?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.799
Well, we thought we would all
go to a picnic...

14:46.176 --> 14:48.887
...in Central Park!
- Central Park?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.264
All of us. All day.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.849
That sucks!

14:54.268 --> 14:56.519
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.731
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.901
It's right by my house. All right!

15:04.737 --> 15:08.698
I'm going home to bask in the
triumph of my Central Park idea.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.951
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.496
I wanted to talk to you about...

15:15.706 --> 15:18.875
...this whole new European thing
you've got going on.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.253
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...

15:22.504 --> 15:24.964
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

15:26.175 --> 15:28.676
Just bringing some culture
to the group.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.763
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.265
It makes me want to puke.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.608
Hey, everybody! Pheebs is here!

15:44.902 --> 15:48.696
- Phoebe! Whoo!
- Okay. Whoo! Hi!

15:49.865 --> 15:53.660
Pheebs, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little...

15:53.869 --> 15:56.245
It didn't have any... Well, it blew.

15:58.707 --> 16:03.211
We thought that this afternoon we'd
all go away for the whole weekend...

16:03.420 --> 16:04.712
...to Atlantic City.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.384
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan!
Whose plan was that?

16:09.593 --> 16:10.677
Mine!

16:12.054 --> 16:14.555
- Wait. It was my plan.
- No...

16:14.807 --> 16:17.141
...I said we needed a new plan.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.394
And I came up with Atlantic City.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.604
Which is the new plan.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.193
Why don't we, um, all
meet upstairs in an hour?

16:27.361 --> 16:28.695
Okay.

16:28.862 --> 16:32.407
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.244
Let's go.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.997
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.167
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
so you can't tell him.

16:43.377 --> 16:45.503
You know what? That doesn't matter.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.425
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...

16:50.634 --> 16:52.468
...and not have them say it back?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.264
I don't care.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.475
Okay...

17:00.060 --> 17:01.811
I can't watch.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.118
What you reading?

17:19.371 --> 17:20.413
Paper.

17:20.664 --> 17:22.498
Yeah? What's it about?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.170
The events from around the globe.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.505
Okay...

17:31.008 --> 17:35.011
Uh, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.888
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.016
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.

17:40.642 --> 17:41.934
Once at work...

17:42.144 --> 17:44.729
...I thought carbon dating
is fossilized...

17:44.980 --> 17:47.732
I'm really trying
to tell you something here.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.026
Yeah...

17:50.235 --> 17:51.527
Go ahead.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.239
I think I'm just going to say it.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.908
I'm just going to say it.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.702
Uh...

18:05.834 --> 18:09.087
I'm still in love with you, Ross.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.974
Wow, uh...

18:22.726 --> 18:23.976
Huh. I'm...

18:24.895 --> 18:26.938
Wow. I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.364
What? Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.327
I'm so dead serious.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.412
I'm totally serious.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.956
Why are you laughing?

18:47.626 --> 18:49.585
Because I just heard it!

18:49.878 --> 18:51.879
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!

18:52.131 --> 18:53.256
I mean...

18:53.507 --> 18:54.715
You're married!

18:55.050 --> 18:57.426
You're married, and it's just ridiculous.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.180
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.

19:01.431 --> 19:06.144
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel...

19:08.939 --> 19:12.275
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

19:16.530 --> 19:18.948
- Well, I am married.
- I know.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.743
Though I haven't spoken to her
since the wedding.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.457
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.920
Actually, it kind of is.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.717
My wife won't return my calls.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.264
I don't know where my wife is.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.729
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"

19:52.024 --> 19:53.357
Oh, God.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.652
Okay.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.448
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?

20:02.701 --> 20:04.243
Well, I kind of have to.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.287
Because the thing is...

20:06.496 --> 20:10.249
The thing is, you know,
that you're married to Emily.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.921
That is what the thing is.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.843
Oh, God.

20:21.678 --> 20:26.015
Things won't be weird between us, right?
Was that stupid?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.350
Me telling you that?

20:27.559 --> 20:29.977
No, no. I'm glad you did.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.314
If nothing else...

20:33.523 --> 20:36.776
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.237
That's what I said!

20:41.823 --> 20:45.618
- Thank you for being so nice.
- No. Thank you for...

20:47.579 --> 20:48.955
Thank you.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.501
- Okay, let's go!
- Yeah, Atlantic City!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.127
Come on!

20:55.337 --> 20:57.296
Atlantic City, baby!

20:58.423 --> 21:00.299
Let's roll some bones. Hey, Joey!

21:00.509 --> 21:02.093
High-five for rolling bones.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.386
- Ow!
- Ow!

21:04.346 --> 21:05.388
Oh.

21:05.555 --> 21:06.722
Ooh!

21:07.182 --> 21:09.100
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.310
Oh, my God. Your water broke.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.396
Oh! Okay!

21:13.981 --> 21:16.148
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.528
Pheebs, we have to take you
to the hospital now.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.407
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.159
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!

21:27.411 --> 21:28.703
Whoo!

21:29.288 --> 21:31.205
Remember when my water broke?

21:36.670 --> 21:39.380
Phoebe's going to have her babies.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.882
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.

21:49.016 --> 21:53.144
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left the room.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.564
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.275
Do you know anything about women?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.569
No.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.362
- It's all right.
- Okay.
