14:55.685 --> 14:58.705

- Uh, a couple of months ago.

14:59.485 --> 15:01.675
- I've always said daylight's overrated.
- You and me both.

15:01.695 --> 15:04.475
- I'd like you to meet Amanda Jones.
- It's a pleasure.

15:04.495 --> 15:05.545
I'm looking forward
to working together.

15:05.565 --> 15:06.595
I've heard a lot about you.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.535

- Probably not.

over the phone?

up those air miles? Hmm?

NATHAN:
<i>After the fall of Qaddafi,</i>

15:20.515 --> 15:23.525
fighters previously loyal to him
began flooding south,

15:23.545 --> 15:27.595
from Libya into Niger
and Northern Mali.

15:27.615 --> 15:30.535
They're highly trained
and well-armed.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.555
Al-Qaeda wants to realize
the dream of Bin Laden's

15:32.575 --> 15:34.675
of a new Afghanistan
in the Sahara.

15:34.695 --> 15:37.535
We did brief our ministers
on the potential blowback

15:37.555 --> 15:39.645
before they started
dropping bombs on Tripoli.

15:39.665 --> 15:42.675
But... you think they listened?

15:42.695 --> 15:44.485
You ever met a politician
who looked beyond

15:44.505 --> 15:45.685

15:45.705 --> 15:47.555
NATHAN: The truth is,
we don't have a full picture

15:47.575 --> 15:48.675
of what's going on down there.

15:48.695 --> 15:50.545
And the Malian government

15:50.565 --> 15:52.475
is going through the motions
of cooperating.

15:52.495 --> 15:54.565
The U.N. has Blue Helmets
on the ground,

15:54.585 --> 15:56.675
but no surprise, they're
underfunded and overstretched,

15:56.695 --> 15:58.555
and to be quite honest
with you,

15:58.575 --> 15:59.675
I don't know
whose side they're on

15:59.695 --> 16:01.555
half the fucking time, anyway.

16:01.575 --> 16:03.565
What are you thinking?

16:03.585 --> 16:07.475
We go down there, small group.

16:07.495 --> 16:09.605
Under the radar.

16:09.625 --> 16:13.525
See if we can get a sense of who
the players are on the ground.

16:13.545 --> 16:15.695
And if we can, we reach out,

16:16.475 --> 16:19.575
and we establish
a back-channel communication.

16:19.595 --> 16:22.485
Lord knows, if we'd have reached
out to our enemies earlier

16:22.505 --> 16:23.685
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

16:23.705 --> 16:27.635
maybe we wouldn't have lost
30,000 coalition troops

16:27.655 --> 16:30.585
and had to kill half
a million people.

16:33.605 --> 16:35.565
So what do you say, George,

16:35.585 --> 16:38.545

in the sun?

16:44.475 --> 16:46.705
You can't just walk in there.

16:50.545 --> 16:53.545
Uh, sorry.

16:53.565 --> 16:54.695
Yeah, I know her, it's fine.

to her, since we left.

18:16.655 --> 18:18.665

- I came out here

18:56.615 --> 18:58.695
No, you came out here

20:42.545 --> 20:44.595

20:44.615 --> 20:49.545
Our initial assessment is that
the attack was spontaneous.

We believe that the soldiers
were a target of opportunity,
